01:07.480 --> 01:09.118
All right?

01:09.200 --> 01:12.749
- I want a word with you.
- All right, Victor. All right, doll.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.598
All right, doll.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.194
Oh, my, that step's awful high.

01:22.320 --> 01:26.757
- What are you having?
- I'm going to the Victoria to visit my sister.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.628
- You want a long ticket or a short one?
- I've only got 25 pence.

01:30.720 --> 01:35.510
I think you'll be cheaper with a long ticket.
Stick your money in there.

01:36.120 --> 01:39.110
You hold onto that and take a walk
down to that first seat there. OK?

01:40.720 --> 01:42.676
Nice and steady now.

01:51.880 --> 01:55.793
I'll get this nice inspector here
to roll it up nice and tight for you.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.030
All right, Victor?

01:58.120 --> 02:00.634
There you go.

02:00.720 --> 02:01.994
All right, pal.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.196
That seems correct.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.632
I don't know.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.900
What the fuck's that?
I hope you're going to pay for that.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.036
I'll make it up later.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.076
- And what's this?
- What about it?

02:18.280 --> 02:23.229
McGurk. He's down the road and he's
after your blood. Just give me that poster.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.231
Be careful. That's a work of art.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.835
A work of art? McGurk scratching his balls?

02:29.840 --> 02:34.277
You've already got one suspension
under your belt, Picasso.

02:34.940 --> 02:35.977
You just watch yourself.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.073
I don't know. I'm trying to keep you in a job.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.636
All right, pal.

02:55.380 --> 02:56.236
35, please.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.355
All right, lnspector McGurk.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.112
Tickets, please.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.594
Ticket, please. Your ticket.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.710
I must see your ticket, please.

03:51.140 --> 03:52.710
You show me ticket.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.354
- You have no money?
- No money, no ticket.

03:56.440 --> 04:00.399
No money. Look, it's an offence.
I can get the police here, you know.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.677
- You understand police?
- No.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.274
There must be something that you have...

04:07.560 --> 04:09.000
- I have nothing.
- You have no identification?

04:09.400 --> 04:14.918
You're telling me you've got on the bus
with no money, no ticket, no identification?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.956
This is ridiculous.

04:17.040 --> 04:21.272
You must have some means of showing me
who you are, where you're...

04:21.540 --> 04:23.272
Shylock, it's only 45 pence.
Leave the lassie alone.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.572
- No, no.
- You take it, doll.

04:26.160 --> 04:29.470
- No. I've got you this time, smartarse.
- Don't take it out on her.

04:29.560 --> 04:33.109
- What's your name, Miss?
- She doesn't understand English.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.109
- You listening? She doesn't understand.
- Get back to your cabin.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.792
I'm not going to any fuck all cabin.
She doesn't understand.

04:40.220 --> 04:43.792
I'll ask you one more time. What is your full name?
Give me your full name.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.556
She can't even understand.

04:46.640 --> 04:51.077
I'm telling you. You've got nothing to do
with this. Just you get back in your cabin.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.991
Are you enjoying this? Are you?

04:53.360 --> 04:54.791
If you don't get back... You're in trouble, son.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.877
I'm in trouble? I thought she was in trouble.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.758
- Are you going to throw us a laugh?
- You're in trouble.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.158
This is embarrassing.
These people know this.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.069
- I think it's terrible.
- It is terrible, hen.

05:07.780 --> 05:08.969
Are you listening? It's terrible.

05:09.180 --> 05:12.569
- Just you get back in your cabin!
- It's only fucking 45 pence.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.549
- You fucking miserable prick, you!
- Leave her alone.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
It's disgusting.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.952
Hey, darling, come on.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.552
Thank you.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.480
- Hey, calm down.
- Open that fucking door!

05:27.560 --> 05:31.792
Please calm... Watch your language
in front of the passengers, Mr McGurk.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.997
Ho! You fucking baldy bastard, you!

05:45.880 --> 05:46.997
- George.
- All right, Sammy boy.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.675
What you been up to? He's waiting for you.
You going in like that?

05:51.260 --> 05:52.675
- Fucking really.
- Catch a grip of yourself.

05:53.360 --> 05:57.433
- Just get a wee bit smartened up.
- Who the fuck are you? Coco Chanel?

05:57.520 --> 05:59.431
It'll be OK. Thanks, Sammy.

05:59.520 --> 06:03.957
- What the fuck? Give us my...
- Hey! No smart answers, all right?

06:04.040 --> 06:07.715
- Sammy, come on.
- Keep the trap shut, George.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.356
Come in.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.878
So the scratcher got you at last.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.952
"You big, constipated miserable prick, you."

06:31.800 --> 06:33.995
I don't remember saying constipated.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.595
You don't want this job, do you?

06:36.520 --> 06:38.397
I need it.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.516
Like a hole in the head, you need it.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.513
Right, a week's suspension.
Next time you're out.

06:53.840 --> 06:57.594
Why don't you give me
a shot on the motorbike?

06:57.680 --> 07:01.753
- I'm fixing it the noo.
- That's what you said the last time.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.354
I know, but it was broke last Saturday.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.954
But you told me
I should come last Saturday.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.315
Once I've fixed it, you can get on it.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.838
- How are you doing?
- George Lennox?

07:28.920 --> 07:31.195
- I remember you on the bus.
- Yeah, hi.

07:31.280 --> 07:35.193
- How are you doing?
- Well, I got your address from the bus.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.352
And I just want to say thank you.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.034
No, not at all. It was a pleasure.

07:41.940 --> 07:44.434
- And did you lose your job?
- No. Short sabbatical we call it.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.829
- I'm very sorry.
- Don't worry about it. It's no problem.

07:49.180 --> 07:53.000
I brought... This is for you.
This is present for you.

07:54.160 --> 07:57.277
That's really nice of you.
Thank you very much.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.510
Better stick it in my pocket.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.194
Thank you very much.
That's really nice of you.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.094
Listen, do you want a wee cup of coffee?

08:04.760 --> 08:07.513
- I can't.
- I need to say thank you for the present.

08:07.600 --> 08:12.754
Please. Just two minutes. Yeah?
You make sure she stays here, right?

08:12.840 --> 08:15.718
You stay there. OK?

08:17.040 --> 08:18.018
What's your name?

08:33.039 --> 08:34.518
- Where'd she go?
- She ran away.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.191
I thought I told you to look after her.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.953
- She ran away up there.
- That way?

08:40.280 --> 08:41.953
- Aye.
- You watch my stuff, OK?

08:42.280 --> 08:44.236
See you later.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.553
- Thanks very much.
- Keep the change.

09:05.640 --> 09:09.315
- Two coffees.
- Two coffees, OK. Sorted that.

09:09.400 --> 09:13.678
It's cold. Are you cold? It's always cold here.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.598
Listen, erm... George.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.949
- Carla.
- Carla.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.634
- Very nice to meet you, Carla.
- You, too.

09:23.720 --> 09:25.870
So where is it you come from?

09:25.960 --> 09:29.077
Don't ask me question.
No question, please.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.116
- No questions?
- No.

09:31.200 --> 09:35.273
Fair enough, no questions.
It's a really nice name, Carla.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.510
Thank you.

09:37.600 --> 09:43.072
- I don't suppose you've got a second name.
- I'm sorry, I have to go.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.793
No, you don't need to go. Don't go.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.793
I'm sorry about your job. I have to go.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.493
Why do you need to go?

09:53.160 --> 09:55.469
I have to go.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.469
Carla, you give me your phone number?

10:00.160 --> 10:03.197
Come on. I'm amazing company, really.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.236
I'll even let you drive my bus.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.473
5401 19.

10:11.020 --> 10:13.473
5401 19.
I'll phone you.

10:41.020 --> 10:42.470
- You want the change, Sammy?
- Aye.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.833
All right, girls?

11:07.120 --> 11:11.238
What's up with yo u, man?
You've hardly said a word all night.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.398
- Nothing.
- Nothing, aye.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.233
- Come on, tell your Uncle Sam.
- Get off, Sam.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.278
Is it McGurk?
ls it something to do with the work?

11:22.320 --> 11:24.578
It's nothing to do with the work, Sammy.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.514
You playing hard to get with this man, eh?

11:28.600 --> 11:32.832
- What you saying to him?
- Tell him to shut up. He's nipping my head.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.229
- Shut up.
- Nothing like a good night out!

11:35.320 --> 11:38.039
I would like to do one of
my favourite songs.

11:38.120 --> 11:41.510
Let's see all the couples
on the dance floor for Miss You Nights.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.239
George, come on. Come on, George.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.516
Is he steaming?

12:01.680 --> 12:05.389
Oh, listen, Rosemary can get us
a great discount with flowers.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.630
- Good, good.
- Aye.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.314
And I don't give a toss about a fancy car.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.550
Well, we'll not get you one, then.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.596
Are you OK?

12:15.680 --> 12:17.477
Aye.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.471
Kiss me.

12:46.240 --> 12:51.997
For fuck's sake, driver, what's
the matter? Give us a shot of that wheel.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.548
- For fuck's sake!

12:55.400 --> 12:58.153
Come on, driver!
You're going the wrong way.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.153
- God Almighty.
- Aye, right.

13:01.520 --> 13:06.275
Will this be happening every second before
we get off at our stop? Fucking nut job...

14:19.560 --> 14:22.358
Thank you. Thank you.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.678
Thank you. Thank you.

14:27.320 --> 14:30.949
Thank you. Thank you.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.190
That was really good.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.236
Thank you.

14:38.760 --> 14:43.197
So how come you gave me
the bum telephone number, Carla?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.756
Sorry. I'm going.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.990
You keep running away all the time.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.871
Carla?

15:03.080 --> 15:05.230
Fuck you, you again?

15:05.320 --> 15:07.470
Yeah.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.300
Carla, why did you give me
the bum telephone number?

15:10.520 --> 15:12.909
- Why did you ask me?
- Because I'm fucking concerned about you.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.833
Jesus Christ, you don't live in here?

15:17.920 --> 15:20.798
- This is my home.
- It's a fucking terrible place.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.798
Listen, you can't come in here, OK?
You can't.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.498
- OK, then.
- Go!

15:27.080 --> 15:29.071
- OK.
- Go now!

15:35.240 --> 15:39.836
- Carla, Jesus Christ, this place is a dump.
- Stop following me.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.469
I don't even know why you're staying here.

15:43.560 --> 15:46.233
Just five minutes, darling, and I'll be away.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.869
- Are you OK?
- Will you open this door?

15:49.960 --> 15:51.916
Carla.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.956
Who do you think you are?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.996
Talk to me.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.958
Jesus, what a dump this is.

16:05.040 --> 16:10.034
- You don't understand what get out means.
- Carla, calm down, it's OK.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.076
- Carla.
- Get out!

16:12.160 --> 16:15.709
- Carla, come here, come here.
- Get out. Get out. Get out.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.758
- It's OK.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.473
It's OK. It's all right.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.836
I'm sorry.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.596
Look, I'm sorry, l...

16:35.560 --> 16:38.028
What the hell's going on in there?

16:39.960 --> 16:43.714
Open this door
or I'm gonna boot the fucker down.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.872
- Who the hell are you?
- Spiritual advisor.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.838
- Corporation supplying them nowadays?
- Very good.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.070
- Right, you, out.
- It's not her fault.

16:54.160 --> 16:57.709
Out. You, too because
you knew the golden rule.

16:57.800 --> 17:01.554
- It's not her fault. I barged my way in.
- Barged your way in?

17:01.640 --> 17:03.710
Nobody, but nobody barges past me.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.950
You fucking listening to what I'm saying?

17:06.040 --> 17:09.031
I want you two out in five minutes
or I'm phoning the police.

17:09.119 --> 17:11.156
- You're no' listening.
- Quiet!

17:11.240 --> 17:14.789
You've got four minutes now
and I'm phoning the police.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.915
Carla, look, you couldn't
stay here anyway, darling.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.714
Look, come with me.
I'll take you someplace better than this.

17:32.800 --> 17:38.193
I've got a pal and he's got a flat and there's
a room in his flat and you can stay there.

17:38.280 --> 17:42.353
It's a fucking huge flat and he's got a big
room and you can have that, no rent.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.590
I'll sort that out with Sammy.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.433
You don't have to pay any rent or anything.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.994
Listen, it's a nice place, Carla, you know?

17:58.960 --> 18:00.916
Much better than here.

18:01.760 --> 18:05.833
And we can go tonight. Get you sorted out.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.239
OK.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.878
Aye, OK.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.789
Right, just go up the stairs.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.836
I hope Sammy's got milk.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.754
- All right, man.
- All right, Sammy.

18:36.840 --> 18:40.799
Er... Sammy, this is Carla. Carla, Sammy.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.836
In you go.

18:46.320 --> 18:49.278
- What the fuck are you playing at?
- Not now.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.476
Coast clear?

18:55.560 --> 18:58.074
- What do you mean?
- Empty.

18:58.160 --> 19:00.754
- Yeah.
- Good. Come on, Carla.

19:11.040 --> 19:15.272
- I tell you what, sack your cleaner.
- Just can't get the staff.

19:16.840 --> 19:20.196
Don't you worry, Carla.
We'll soon have this place tidied up.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.236
You sit there, darling. Sit there.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.036
Get this fire on, heat you up.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.591
I'll be back in a minute.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.432
Come on.

19:40.560 --> 19:44.917
- That'll be breakfast for three, then, aye?
- Don't jump to conclusions.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.155
I'm not jumping to conclusions. It's just...
You're auditioning bridesmaids?

19:51.240 --> 19:54.789
Just thought you'd let the best man
have a wee say who's who.

19:54.880 --> 19:59.317
No, it's Maureen's pen pal just flown in, aye?

20:00.360 --> 20:04.592
Who did she see? The groom to be,
number 72. There you are.

20:05.440 --> 20:10.639
- Oh, far be it for me to jump to any...
- For fuck's sake, Sammy. It's no' like that.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.676
It's just...

20:14.680 --> 20:19.708
I don't know what the fuck it's about.
I'm just trying to help a lassie out.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.756
That's all right.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.230
There's some tea, Carla.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.236
Thank you.

20:37.320 --> 20:41.757
Listen, I had a word with Sammy
and you can stay here as long as you like.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.990
Sammy's a good man.

20:45.240 --> 20:49.199
Nicaragua...is where I come from.

20:49.280 --> 20:52.397
Nicaragua? Right.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.109
Did I hurt you?

20:57.200 --> 20:59.509
Did you hurt me?

20:59.600 --> 21:01.750
No, I've had a lot worse than that.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.990
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.033
Crazy guy.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.195
Crazy dancer.

21:27.580 --> 21:28.595
All right, doll.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.495
Fucking stupid...

21:44.480 --> 21:45.495
That's fucking clever, mate.

21:47.560 --> 21:50.950
Did you see that there?
See the way he pulled in like that?

21:51.040 --> 21:53.713
- Are you blind?
- I had a fucking indicator on!

21:53.800 --> 21:58.237
- Do you not use your mirrors?
- You shouldn't pull into a bus stop like that.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.992
Check your bloody mirrors!

22:00.080 --> 22:02.036
Why pull in? The taxi's there.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.476
I was pulling in past the bus stop.
Do you not use your mirrors?

22:05.520 --> 22:09.076
I'm driving the fucking bus.
Passengers could be walking off there.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.233
- Never mind your passengers!
- Fucking sorry.

22:12.320 --> 22:15.437
I'm asking for a bit of professional courtesy.

22:15.520 --> 22:19.593
- Passengers could walk in front.
- Never mind them. Look at my back light.

22:19.680 --> 22:23.229
- Away to fuck. You use your mirrors.
- Your punter's fucked off.

22:23.320 --> 22:25.470
- You wee shite, get back here!

22:25.560 --> 22:29.189
- You're paying for my back light.
- Let's try and catch him up.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.794
Open this door! Where are you going?

22:32.280 --> 22:34.094
- Let's just go for a wee run.
- Open this door!

22:34.480 --> 22:38.553
Get this door open! My money's in that taxi!
Open this door up!

22:39.180 --> 22:41.553
- We'll try and find him for you.
- Are you off your head?

22:41.920 --> 22:44.388
My money's in that fuckin' taxi!

22:45.120 --> 22:46.188
Calm down. Calm down.

22:47.020 --> 22:48.588
Shit. My money's in that taxi!

22:50.360 --> 22:53.875
- Right, stop this bus right now!
- I'm taking you on a wee tour.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.269
Open this door! I want off this bus right now.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.769
- A magical mystery tour.
- Open this fucking door!

22:59.160 --> 23:03.995
Look, I'll tell everybody it's my fault.
Just pull the fuckin' bus in, will you?

23:06.080 --> 23:08.230
- Want off?
- Aye, I want off.

23:12.880 --> 23:16.759
- Sure you want off?
- Aye, I want off. Now, open the doors!

23:16.840 --> 23:19.798
You want to see a doctor.
You're off your fuckin' head.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.836
Aye, so people tell me.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.536
What are you waiting for now?

23:25.120 --> 23:28.237
You need to all get off the bus.
It's out of service.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.537
I'm not joking. You need to get off.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.537
- The guy's a pot head.
- We could have all been killed.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.591
Ho.

23:54.580 --> 23:56.791
- Ho! Off the bus.
- What's the bus doing here?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.956
Just fuck off.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.838
- OK, OK.

24:01.920 --> 24:05.276
- Where are we going?
- Please don't ask me questions.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.874
- Why?
- No questions.

25:09.320 --> 25:11.390
"Better by bus."

25:59.240 --> 26:01.390
There we are.

26:05.320 --> 26:07.276
- Eh?
- Beautiful.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.316
Yeah.

26:11.360 --> 26:14.316
This mountain over here
is called Ben Lomond.

26:15.040 --> 26:19.795
And this is Loch Lomond.
It goes on for miles and miles.

26:19.880 --> 26:22.235
- It's really beautiful.
- Yeah.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.470
I've been here hundreds of times.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.570
First I came here with my grandfather,
my grandpa.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.388
I was just a wee, wee boy.

26:32.020 --> 26:33.388
He loved it here.

26:34.240 --> 26:39.268
The thing I like about it is it's always
changing all the time, you know?

26:39.360 --> 26:44.229
The sky, the water, the ferns.

26:46.080 --> 26:49.595
I don't know. When I'm pissed off,
it makes me peaceful.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.396
And then when I'm happy...

26:53.840 --> 26:56.957
it makes me more happy.
I don't know. I can't explain it.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.236
Anyway, let's have a seat.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.876
There we go.

27:11.920 --> 27:15.469
I've got a wee surprise. You like surprises?

27:15.560 --> 27:17.516
- Yes.
- Good.

27:19.960 --> 27:22.474
A special treat.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.992
Da-da.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.876
- You like this?
- Yes.

27:28.960 --> 27:31.349
I love this.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.196
Get it off.

27:37.160 --> 27:38.912
Yes!

27:41.080 --> 27:42.832
Here.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.150
OK, toast.

27:49.240 --> 27:52.357
Make a toast
and you're bound to get good luck.

27:55.280 --> 27:58.829
To all my family, to all my friends,

27:58.920 --> 28:04.153
to all the world, to the band I play with,

28:04.240 --> 28:07.789
to the music, to the drinks.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.996
That's lovely.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.629
And... to Antonio.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.676
Wherever he is.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.509
Your... boyfriend?

28:21.600 --> 28:23.909
He was.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.471
And to Nicaragua libre. Free Nicaragua.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.634
Nicaragua libre.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.534
In a oner. In a oner.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.636
Oh, fuck.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.037
Ya... fuckin' bastard.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.076
Go on, you bastard!

29:23.440 --> 29:25.954
Fuck it.

29:26.140 --> 29:27.254
Fuck it, it's no' working.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.753
It's freezing. Come up the back.
It's warmer up here.

29:35.880 --> 29:37.632
Oh, that's better.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.153
Oh!

29:40.640 --> 29:42.358
Oh.

29:42.440 --> 29:46.991
Oh, your hands are cold. Cold.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.991
Yeah.

29:54.440 --> 29:56.192
OK?

29:31.440 --> 29:34.192
It only happened a couple of times,
sweethard.

30:34.880 --> 30:37.189
And have you slept with her?

30:37.280 --> 30:38.918
No.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.956
Did you want to?

30:41.040 --> 30:43.190
For fuck's sake, Maureen.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.589
You've never ever lied to me before.

30:47.240 --> 30:49.754
Probably. I don't know. I hardly know her.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.516
What am I gonna do?

30:56.680 --> 30:59.274
Look, Maureen, you're my best pal, but...

31:01.480 --> 31:03.994
I just don't want to marry you.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.477
I tried to kid myself on. I just can't do it.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.872
My God, you mean it.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.269
I wish I didn't but it's true.

31:16.360 --> 31:19.636
Maureen. Maureen. Maureen.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.678
- Maureen.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.716
Come here, please.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.196
Carla?

32:10.480 --> 32:12.232
Carla?

32:21.120 --> 32:22.872
Carla?

32:57.120 --> 32:59.429
For God's sake.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.476
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.396
Fuck!

33:04.480 --> 33:06.835
God. Fuck.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.435
Get up, for fuck's sake.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.438
Fuck!

33:13.520 --> 33:17.069
Oh, fucking Jesus fucking Christ.

33:17.160 --> 33:19.754
Oh, Carla.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.990
Come on.

33:26.440 --> 33:29.034
Shit. Fucking shit.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.594
Excuse me. How's the lassie?

33:54.680 --> 33:57.797
Well, erm, she's just been seen
by the consultant

33:57.880 --> 34:01.316
and...well, she's not responding
as well as we'd hoped,

34:01.400 --> 34:05.393
so we're just going to give her
a wee bit of help with her blood pressure.

34:05.480 --> 34:09.109
So erm, it'll be an hour or so
before we know.

34:09.199 --> 34:10.918
Any chance I can sit in there?

34:11.000 --> 34:15.197
I'll check with the doctor. If you want
to take a seat and I'll get back to you.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.235
No problem.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.596
How's she doing?

34:26.679 --> 34:29.558
It's close. Too close for comfort really.

34:30.179 --> 34:31.958
- Jesus Christ.
- She's been through a lot.

34:32.239 --> 34:34.549
Twice in six weeks is
more than most people...

34:34.639 --> 34:35.958
What?

34:36.040 --> 34:38.679
- I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
- Knew what?

34:38.760 --> 34:42.719
Well, she went through
much the same thing six weeks ago.

34:42.800 --> 34:45.313
I was on call at the time, took her in.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.755
- She's... I'm afraid to say.

34:48.719 --> 34:52.679
- I'm sorry. I'm going to have to dash.
- It's all right. Thanks a lot. Cheers.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.756
Fucking hell, Carla.

35:21.280 --> 35:25.717
"Carla's symptoms suggest
post-traumatic stress.."

35:25.800 --> 35:28.598
"Dancer with group in Nicaragua.."

35:29.200 --> 35:32.098
"Said country in state of war.."

35:34.720 --> 35:37.951
"Her group toured areas of extreme danger.."

35:38.040 --> 35:41.430
"lnvolved in some sort
of incident to do with that.."

35:41.520 --> 35:45.672
"Patient becomes confused
on being questioned about it and can't..."

35:45.760 --> 35:48.593
"won't give account
of what actually happened."

35:49.360 --> 35:50.759
Jesus.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.059
"Came to Europe
seven months ago with group.."

35:53.680 --> 35:57.229
"intention to promote support for cause."

35:57.320 --> 36:00.835
"Stayed in UK when group
returned to Nicaragua."

36:00.920 --> 36:04.708
"Joined up with Salvadorian refugees
in London for two months.."

36:04.800 --> 36:06.756
"Chaotic existence.."

36:07.700 --> 36:10.750
"Knew Glasgow only
as their first venue in UK.."

36:12.280 --> 36:14.032
"No friends here."

36:17.040 --> 36:20.271
- I'm fucking sorry, Sammy.
- It's all right.

36:20.360 --> 36:23.477
- Is she all right?
- I don't know if she's... She's all right.

36:31.080 --> 36:34.197
There was a lot of letters lying
about the floor.

36:34.380 --> 36:37.797
- Where'd you put 'em?
- Hung 'em up in the kitchen to dry out.

36:38.440 --> 36:40.795
I'm just gonna take this wee photo.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.595
I don't know what the fuck it is.
It means something to her, anyway.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.516
What'll we do with 'em?

36:58.560 --> 37:00.471
Don't know.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.670
Get every one of them.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.954
These two look the best.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.076
Carla.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.632
Carla.

38:13.320 --> 38:16.357
- All right, darlin'?
- Fine, sweetheart. You?

38:16.720 --> 38:19.157
I'm OK to you.
Cómo estás, Carla?

38:19.440 --> 38:22.193
- Bien.
- Bien. That's the three of us all right.

38:22.280 --> 38:24.874
- Come on. Up you come.
- You look lovely, Sammy.

38:24.960 --> 38:29.476
Aye, so do you.
Real men wear pinnies, do you not know?

38:29.560 --> 38:32.677
Good to see you, darlin'.
In you come. In you come.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.591
I'll whip that off you later on.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.511
Hold on there. Wait a minute.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.556
Just a wee minute.

38:41.080 --> 38:46.473
- Now is the time.
- Now is the time. Da-da!

38:51.000 --> 38:52.956
It's beautiful.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.552
Thank you.

38:55.640 --> 38:59.394
- No es nada, companera.
- That's nice, Sammy boy.

38:59.480 --> 39:02.153
- You'd never do this for me.
- I'd do this for you.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.912
- Would you fuck.
- I would.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.994
It's really beautiful...but there is one mistake.

39:10.480 --> 39:14.029
This one is A, not O.

39:14.120 --> 39:16.793
- You fucked it up.
- I got a wee dictionary.

39:16.880 --> 39:21.431
Spanish-English dictionary. Oh, well,
you can't get the grammar in everything.

39:21.520 --> 39:23.397
- Thank you.
- Hey, ho, ho.

39:23.480 --> 39:24.913
Ho, ho, ho, enough.

39:37.920 --> 39:41.469
No...no hands.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.516
Get out of that.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.556
Well done.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.876
Come here.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.916
- Have to cheat a wee bit.
- No hands.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.953
These tights are gonna be
a bit of a problem.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.834
Oh, fucking hell.

40:49.360 --> 40:52.477
My teeth are going to go fuckin' flying out.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.030
- OK?
- Mm-hm.

41:05.120 --> 41:07.270
You need to kiss it better, though.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.476
Stand up.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.037
Stand up.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.752
OK.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.393
Oh, no, no. Fuck it, fuck it.

41:48.480 --> 41:51.233
Enough of that. Come here.

42:12.320 --> 42:15.437
Fucking hell, Carla,
what happened to your back?

42:16.920 --> 42:19.229
I'm sorry.

42:19.320 --> 42:23.199
Carla... Carla, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

42:23.280 --> 42:26.078
I'm sorry, darling, OK?
It's just a shock, OK?

42:26.160 --> 42:28.469
Just hold me.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.112
I'm sorry, Carla.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.872
I'm sorry, baby.

42:47.880 --> 42:52.670
Can...can you tell me about the letters?

42:54.280 --> 42:56.589
- The letters?
- The letters.

42:57.640 --> 43:00.996
From Antonio... Mi companero.

43:02.360 --> 43:04.954
He was...hurt.

43:06.240 --> 43:09.391
- Really hurt.
- He was hurt?

43:10.480 --> 43:12.710
Too hurt. Too hurt.

43:12.800 --> 43:14.756
It's OK. It's OK.

43:14.840 --> 43:16.796
Please don't cry.

43:17.800 --> 43:22.078
More than one letter, I never opened them.

43:23.000 --> 43:28.950
After the day in the mountain,
I feel very strong.

43:29.900 --> 43:32.050
And I opened the letters.

43:33.800 --> 43:35.756
What did they say?

43:35.840 --> 43:38.957
Nothing. And everything.

43:41.680 --> 43:44.353
l don't understand, darlin'.
What do you mean?

43:45.400 --> 43:47.391
Song.

43:47.900 --> 43:59.991
A simple song that we wrote together,

43:51.360 --> 43:54.477
until the... We just played.

43:55.460 --> 43:56.577
What happened to him?

44:00.460 --> 44:01.577
Carla, what happened to Antonio?

44:05.460 --> 44:07.577
Promise not to ask.

44:08.560 --> 44:10.516
Not to ask.

44:12.080 --> 44:15.675
- Promise me.
- OK, OK, I promise. I promise.

44:16.880 --> 44:19.189
On the life of your mother.

44:20.040 --> 44:21.792
Say it.

44:22.940 --> 44:25.392
On the life of my mother,
I promise I'll never ask.

44:36.680 --> 44:38.989
For you, to Nicaragua?

44:39.080 --> 44:40.513
For me.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.949
- For me?
- For you.

44:50.640 --> 44:54.519
Listen, you can't imagine
the situation at my home.

44:55.140 --> 44:56.319
It's too dangerous for you.

44:57.640 --> 45:02.319
But listen, Carla, we can't keep running
away from this. We can't bury this.

45:03.160 --> 45:04.912
Am I right or am I wrong?

45:07.660 --> 45:09.912
- You are right.
- I scared you when I said that.

45:12.360 --> 45:15.712
But I don't know where Antonio is.

45:16.360 --> 45:21.712
Carla, you have nightmares about this guy.
You dream about this guy.

45:22.440 --> 45:28.310
You don't know where he is, whether
he's hurt or he's alive, whether he's dead.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.356
We have to find him.

45:53.320 --> 45:55.276
- This is my mum.
- Your mum?

45:55.360 --> 45:56.713
Yes.

45:57.720 --> 46:04.114
And this is my sister...Lisa and Francisca.

46:04.200 --> 46:05.952
Goodness.

46:07.500 --> 46:08.999
- Who's that?
- Bradley.

46:09.880 --> 46:12.394
We'll find him the first.

46:12.480 --> 46:15.836
- Before your family?
- Yes.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.836
He'll help us find Antonio.

46:20.500 --> 46:21.536
So what does he do?

46:22.500 --> 46:26.036
Now he work for Acción Cristiana
Permanente por la Paz.

46:27.080 --> 46:29.435
A US voluntary group.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.590
So he's a human rights campaigner?

46:31.680 --> 46:33.238
Yes.

46:35.840 --> 46:38.640
Who's that?

46:38.640 --> 46:40.278
Antonio.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.349
Hey, Carla, any of these?

47:19.440 --> 47:21.396
No, we can't.

47:24.520 --> 47:28.399
- Carla, I need a drink.
- No good for you.

47:28.480 --> 47:31.438
Carla, I need it. I need it.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.829
You want to live in the toilet one week?

47:33.920 --> 47:36.070
- No.
- No good for you. Come on.

47:36.160 --> 47:38.310
Fuck it. Yeah, yeah.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.310
George, come on.

47:45.500 --> 47:46.510
Carry on, carry on.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.759
Carry on.

47:50.680 --> 47:52.398
Come on!

48:15.680 --> 48:19.593
George! George, do you have money?

48:19.680 --> 48:21.432
- Money?
- Yeah.

48:21.520 --> 48:24.353
You have ticket, you have to pay.

48:25.020 --> 48:28.353
- I've no' got any money.
- No money, no ticket.

48:29.280 --> 48:31.874
- You've got the money.
- Yeah, I know.

48:32.920 --> 48:35.354
Skip on for nothing.

48:56.520 --> 48:58.554
George?

49:01.020 --> 49:02.554
Let her see it.

49:06.680 --> 49:08.753
Carla, tell her she can keep it.

49:08.840 --> 49:11.195
This is for my family.

49:11.280 --> 49:13.430
The bag's too heavy anyway.

49:14.080 --> 49:15.832
You like it?

49:20.000 --> 49:21.752
Here.

49:31.360 --> 49:33.157
OK.

49:33.240 --> 49:34.878
Jesus.

49:39.320 --> 49:41.276
- Buenas.
- Buenos días..

49:49.960 --> 49:54.033
OK. We have good luck. He is here.

49:54.120 --> 49:56.634
- Bradley?
- Yeah. We have to wait.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.631
OK.

50:00.440 --> 50:04.194
The delegation that
we have coming down now...

50:04.280 --> 50:06.032
- Sit.
- OK.

50:06.120 --> 50:09.954
From Vermont we have the March 8th
National Women's Delegation.

50:10.040 --> 50:13.555
They're bringing down a pattern
for this woman from Colorado.

50:13.640 --> 50:16.837
They need to decide where
they're going to go. Women's places.

50:17.040 --> 50:18.437
That's him there, isn't it?

50:18.960 --> 50:20.632
Mm-hm. This is Bradley.

50:20.720 --> 50:23.837
They were there in '84
and want to go back and visit a family.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.229
- Press coverage?
- No press coverage.

50:26.320 --> 50:30.472
I don't think there'll be any outcome.
It's Bradley's turn to pick up reports.

50:30.560 --> 50:33.074
Everybody needs to turn your reports
over to him.

50:33.160 --> 50:35.469
- Let me have them.
- Here's my report.

50:35.560 --> 50:37.915
- That's mine.
- That's mine.

50:39.640 --> 50:43.952
- Photographs?
- Yup. Watch out, this one's...

50:46.540 --> 50:48.952
- So, are you going to go through 'em?
- What's this?

50:49.160 --> 50:51.116
I don't know which one it is.

50:51.200 --> 50:54.317
Uh... "An eerie silence
hangs over the scene,

50:54.400 --> 50:57.517
as we view the charred remains
of the house and farm

50:57.600 --> 51:00.717
that was once
the Enrique Schmitt Cooperative.

51:00.800 --> 51:05.351
Vultures fly overhead. My eyes fill with tears
as I examine the burnt-out remnants

51:05.440 --> 51:07.396
of their humble homes."

51:07.480 --> 51:11.837
Jesus, Laura, this is Witness For Peace,
not War And Peace.

51:12.680 --> 51:17.117
You know, Laura, we really need specific...
specific information.

51:17.200 --> 51:19.350
- It's there.
- No, it's not there.

51:19.440 --> 51:22.876
- Did you read the rest of it?
- Tomas? Where's his last name?

51:22.960 --> 51:26.396
All right, now I've read it.
His name isn't there. It's Tomas who?

51:26.480 --> 51:28.436
- How many Contras...

51:28.520 --> 51:30.476
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

51:31.020 --> 51:36.476
Laura, we need time, date, location,
fatalities, civilian or otherwise.

51:50.680 --> 51:53.513
- You want drink?
- Is the beer OK?

51:53.600 --> 51:57.832
Yes, it's OK. Victoria is really good.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.732
I could murder a pint.

52:04.560 --> 52:06.516
- Carla.
- Gracias.

52:06.600 --> 52:08.113
Thank you.

52:08.200 --> 52:11.317
- Have you seen people from the Brigadista?
- No.

52:11.400 --> 52:13.516
- Vicky, Santiago, Ramon?
- No.

52:13.600 --> 52:17.752
- Rafael?
- Yeah, I hear from Rafael now and then.

52:17.840 --> 52:21.389
The last I heard is he's up in Esteli,
being worked to death by Norma.

52:21.640 --> 52:23.089
Trying to get away from her.

52:24.520 --> 52:27.478
I'd talk to her if she'd give you 30 seconds.

52:28.680 --> 52:32.559
Rafael, he teaches literacy, you know?

52:32.640 --> 52:34.551
- Reading and writing?
- Yeah.

52:34.640 --> 52:39.551
People from the country, campesinos,
old people, young people. Well...

52:44.720 --> 52:46.312
Look.

52:46.400 --> 52:48.914
Here we'll find Norma.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.753
And here is where my family live now.

52:51.840 --> 52:55.196
Who has to move out from Estelí.

52:55.280 --> 52:57.032
How come?

52:57.120 --> 53:01.910
Well, this is where my sister
went after my brothers.

53:02.220 --> 53:04.210
They killed one. Mauricio.

53:05.120 --> 53:09.352
This is Esperanza, where they live.

53:09.440 --> 53:12.716
And here the biggest Contra camp.

53:13.340 --> 53:14.616
Jesus, it's tricky.

53:16.840 --> 53:21.356
- Hey, do that. Yeah, that.
- What do you do?

53:21.440 --> 53:24.989
Hang on. That's your sphincter.
The muscles around your orifice.

53:25.080 --> 53:26.274
- Don't.
- Hang on.

53:26.980 --> 53:30.300
What was the last time you were so scared,
so fucking paralysed...

53:30.400 --> 53:33.676
- Shut up! Bradley!
- ..you were taken over by your asshole.

53:33.760 --> 53:36.354
Hence the reflexive verb to shit oneself.

53:36.440 --> 53:39.830
- Tricky, very tricky.
- OK. Fair enough. I get it.

53:43.280 --> 53:46.272
Bradley, have you seen Antonio?

53:46.360 --> 53:50.433
- No, I already told you. Don't ask me again.
- Fucking callous bastard.

53:50.520 --> 53:53.353
You're an ignoramus.
What the fuck are you doing here?

53:53.440 --> 53:55.749
- Fuck you, man.
- What was that?

53:55.840 --> 53:58.638
I said fuck you. Is there a fucking problem?

53:58.720 --> 54:00.711
Bradley!

54:07.720 --> 54:12.211
I'm going up north tomorrow,
in case you're still here.

54:20.320 --> 54:21.711
Fucking wank.

54:26.880 --> 54:31.317
- Forget him. He's an old friend.
- He's a fucking headcase.

54:35.480 --> 54:40.508
Listen, we'll find Norma and Rafael.

54:40.600 --> 54:42.989
They know where Antonio is.

54:56.160 --> 55:00.597
Uh, he say, what do you grow
in your country?

55:00.680 --> 55:03.478
- What do I grow?
- Yes.

55:04.280 --> 55:06.078
Er...nothing.

55:07.600 --> 55:09.556
Any corn?

55:09.640 --> 55:11.790
No.

55:13.920 --> 55:15.638
Any beans?

55:15.720 --> 55:17.039
No.

55:17.720 --> 55:18.939
Melons?

55:19.760 --> 55:22.399
No melons either.

55:22.480 --> 55:25.278
I've got something, actually.

55:25.360 --> 55:27.510
Tell him.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.875
We grow... It takes a long time to grow.

55:29.960 --> 55:32.713
It takes ten years to grow.

55:34.480 --> 55:36.630
In a bottle.

55:36.720 --> 55:38.870
Whisky.

55:41.320 --> 55:43.072
Try it.

55:48.560 --> 55:53.156
He say, "What a fucking wonderful country."

55:53.240 --> 55:55.800
A fucking wonderful country.

56:14.540 --> 56:16.200
Refreshments!

56:18.240 --> 56:19.300
Wait 10 minutes, please!

56:26.240 --> 56:29.200
We run a co-operative.
Show your friend.

56:30.540 --> 56:32.000
He'll see how title deeds work here.

56:34.520 --> 56:38.593
He want that you see
these deeds for the land.

56:38.680 --> 56:40.318
- Deeds for the land?
- Yes.

56:41.080 --> 56:42.518
How did he get the land?

56:47.440 --> 56:50.193
The revolution gave the people
from the country...

56:57.680 --> 57:02.834
500 acres of land.
Now there are 40 families there.

57:08.600 --> 57:11.956
And he say that before
this is only for one man

57:12.040 --> 57:13.758
and now it's for 40 men.

57:13.840 --> 57:17.469
- One rich bastard owned the whole thing?
- Yes, 500 only for one people.

57:17.560 --> 57:21.633
Yes and now 40 families lives and...

57:21.720 --> 57:24.314
- So 500 for one before, 500 for 40 now.
- Yes.

57:24.400 --> 57:28.029
What happens if the rich bastard
comes back? The one guy.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.509
If the owner comes back,
we're all united.

57:32.600 --> 57:36.509
We'll fight him with rifles
and we'll beat him off again.

57:36.960 --> 57:40.077
I think I know what he's saying.
Tell him to fuck off.

57:42.060 --> 57:46.077
- Yes, he can fuck off!
- Free country or death!

57:53.680 --> 57:59.994
And she say that now
everybody's happy because...

58:00.080 --> 58:05.837
because everybody, the companero,

58:05.920 --> 58:09.879
give the sangre,
give the blood for the revolution

58:09.960 --> 58:13.396
and now everybody is in this revolution.

58:14.600 --> 58:18.673
We'll resist because it's our revolution
and nobody can take it away from us.

58:24.000 --> 58:28.073
And the revolution is new
and we defend the revolution.

58:28.160 --> 58:35.077
And anybody come back to Nicaragua...

58:35.160 --> 58:40.188
Now everybody's free
and the people from the USA,

58:40.260 --> 58:42.088
you know, gringos, don't come back here.

58:52.360 --> 58:56.876
And she say now everybody different,
this revolution,

58:56.960 --> 59:02.956
because this revolution is for people,
young people, children, old people,

59:03.040 --> 59:09.309
and everybody can't forget everybody,
todos los companeros.

59:09.400 --> 59:13.837
All the companeros that give
the life for this revolution.

59:14.100 --> 59:15.537
And everybody together.

59:22.480 --> 59:24.198
Sorry.

59:24.280 --> 59:26.236
- Where's the bag?
- I don't know.

59:26.320 --> 59:29.198
- The big bag.
- Hey!

59:29.280 --> 59:33.068
Hey! Hey!

59:33.160 --> 59:36.550
- George, where is my bag?
- It's only a few bottles of shampoo.

59:36.640 --> 59:39.154
- My presents.
- I know, but the bus is away.

59:39.240 --> 59:44.030
You don't understand. This is people
living in the middle of the war.

59:44.120 --> 59:47.669
Give me my other bag.
You don't understand anything.

59:55.960 --> 59:58.474
- Not too bad, eh?
- No.

59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.074
Could be worse.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.674
Seems all right. Mm.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.276
So the lights have gone down.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.597
- What's happening?
- Don't worry. Happens all the time.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.478
Ach, well, who needs lights, eh?

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.552
Nice wee comfy bed.
We can give that a wee test.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.234
A wee tryout.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.914
- You're mad.
- Aye, it's OK, isn't it?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.718
Yes.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.476
Corre, Antonio.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.718
Asesinos, hijos de la gran puta!

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.074
What's the matter? It's OK.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.310
It's OK. It's OK.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.318
Combatant Ronald Lopez...

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.918
...fell in defence of this country.

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:16.518
His family and the Sandanista
National Liberation Front...

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:19.018
...invite you to the wake tonight...

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:25.230
- How long have you known Norma?
- Well, we met three years ago.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:30.872
She very strong. She work with women.
Very strong.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.076
- I ask is... is Norma here.
- OK.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.076
- Can you tell me if Norma is here?
- Yes, but she's in a meeting.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.749
- She's here.
- OK.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.069
- Norma.
- Carla.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.518
Me?

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.716
Sí.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.596
All right. For me?

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.996
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:55.234
Er... I'm George. George, aye, aye.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.153
- Mi nombre es Carina.
- Carina. Carina.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.595
- Maricella.
- Maricella.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.895
- Jara.
- Jara. Nice names.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.032
- Soweta.
- Soweta.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:08.237
Mm. That's good, that. Great. It's nice.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.312
- Novia? Girlfriend?
- Girlfriend?

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:14.512
Er...tricky question.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.877
Erm...it's a long story. Maybe, so kind of.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.550
Open to offers, you know.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.050
- George.
- Companero there.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.149
- Ah.
- There you go.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.549
He's my friend.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.749
- He came with you?
- Yes, from Scotland.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.990
Bye. Bye. Bye.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.633
- Hi.
- Are you OK?

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.678
- I'm fine.
- Norma, George. George, Norma.

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:43.678
- Hi, Norma.
- Nice to meat you.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:45.278
Very nice to meat you, too. Yes.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.996
- Do you like our place?
- Yeah, it's very friendly.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.197
Many little friends, but one big enemy.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.430
- You know.
- Yeah.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.476
So do you have news of Antonio?

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.317
I saw Antonio six months ago.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.358
Just before he left hospital.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:07.513
I've tried to make contact, but it's difficult.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.919
I understand.

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:13.219
- Rafael doesn't know where he is?
- No, yes, he might know.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.019
You can ask him, he lives nearby.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.269
We could do whatever.

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.369
- Yeah, good idea.
-

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:31.069
- What do you think?
- Yeah, I've got some new pals.

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:38.069
A bus hit a mine... an ambush..

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.349
I want you to go home, George.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.674
Do you mean that?

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:42.674
I mean it. I want you to think about this
and be honest with me.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.989
I'm not going to leave you now, Carla.

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.589
There are many things to tell you.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:58.354
We'll see this through together, OK?

01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.854
- Together?
- Together.

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:47.054
Terrific! Great!
Keep going. That's it.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.804
What dou you think, Don Tarnsito?

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:52.104
Could be better.

01:08:54.359 --> 01:08:55.104
Your turn's coming.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:56.904
That's great, Dona Elisenda!

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.000
Let's hear it for Dona Elisenda!

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:02.000
She's the women's representative.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:06.000
And now, let's see...
You! Don Purificacion.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.000
- My name's too long!
- No, come on, I'll help you.

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.000
Like I did last time.
Step up!

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:17.000
Let's write it on the board.

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.000
Higher so we can all read it.

01:09:20.859 --> 01:09:22.000
- How do we start... "Puri"?
- With a "P".

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.200
- With a "P", and then?
- "U"...

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:29.200
"R"...

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.200
- And then?
- "I".

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:40.200
Now the "I"...
That's it. Terrific!

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.200
Let's hear it for Don Purificacion!

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.200
Good, we'll stop there.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.200
You can go,
that'll be all for today.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:57.200
I'll see you all next...?
Thursday.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:03.200
Right. Thank you all for comming.
Don't forget: Thursday. Be on time, OK?

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:07.200
Don't forget your notebooks

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.200
And don't be late.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.000
Hey, Skinny!
It's so great to see you.

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:22.000
- Where'd you vanish to?
- It's a long story.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.000
So good to see you again.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.000
Nice to see you working
with the peasants.

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:30.000
- I stayed to teach.
- That's great.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:35.000
Any news of my family?
My mum, Itza, my brother...

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:40.000
Itza's just fine.
Your mother's well, but sick with worry.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.500
- But they're all well?
- Yes.

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:46.000
They're all in San Cristobal,
don't worry.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.000
That's good.
And the others from the brigade?

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.000
- Vicky, Santiago...
- All working, as usual.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.000
And Antonio?

01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:02.000
- Hey, you got real skinny..
- Cut the "skinny" stuff. And Antonio?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.700
Forget that, Carla.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Fuck! How can I forget?
What happened to Antonio?

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:15.000
Don't know. Ask Bradley.
He may know more than me.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
You all give me the same shit!

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.500
"Ask Rafael".
Rafael says "Ask Bradley".

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:25.500
Where are they? My friends?
Or my so-called friends?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
- We're all with you.
- What is it, then?

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.800
I want to know about Antonio.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
What's the mystery?
He's dead?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
He's alive, he's alive.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
But he's not well.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Where is he? What's he up to?
Who's he with?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I saw him four months ago.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
He didn't want to know about us.
Not you or me or anyone.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Just worry about your family.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I'm going to see them,
but I must know how Antonio is.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
You'll see him later. Go to your mother.
They need you more.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Nose...

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Smell... nose...

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Mouth.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
"Hands up! This is a stick-up!"

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Yul Brynner, Magnificent Seven.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Yul Brynner? He's crazy!
The guy's crazy, he's lying!

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
It's Paul Newman that said it
in Butch Cassidy.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.149
Butch Cassidy?

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.949
Paul Newman said it,
not Yul Brynner.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.788
No.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.997
Yul Brynner said that.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.597
Impossible! I saw the movie.

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:56.797
It was Paul Newman
in Butch Cassidy.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.276
He thinks I'm fucking crazy, man.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.276
Crazy, crazy!
Lies worse than a goat!

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.276
- What does "corre, corre" mean?
- What?

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:16.397
- "Corre, corre."
- It means "run, run." Why?

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.232
Nothing.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.636
Fucking bastard.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.394
- It's OK. It's OK.
- No, no.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.630
Carla, come here. It's OK. It's OK.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.314
No!

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.958
Carla!

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.797
- Jesus Christ.
- Carla! Carla! Carla!

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.317
- For fuck's sake, man, what's happening?
- Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.310
No!

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.310
Can you give me a hand?

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.997
- Bradley, is she OK, man?
- George, give me a hand, kid.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.911
Come on.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.036
- Come on.
- Got her, got her.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.793
- You got her?
- Yeah. Got her, got her.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.796
It's OK. It's OK.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.997
It's OK. You're going to be OK.
You're going to be OK.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.836
You're going to be OK.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:41.037
No, she won't. She won't fucking be OK.

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.537
Why did you lie to me?

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.537
You said you knew nothing
about Antonio.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.037
How is he?

01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:00.837
They killed... his brother.

01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:01.737
- José?
- No, no.

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.037
He went over to the Contras

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:07.537
The kid brother, Pedro.

01:16:07.999 --> 01:16:08.999
- Pedro?
- Sí.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.099
Why'd you come back? Why?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.599
- Because of George.
- Shit!

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:24.199
No, Bradley.
No, Bradley, he was right.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
He saved my life.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
And I love him.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:31.500
And Antonio?

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:35.500
I couldn't bear it any more.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.000
But I can't forget him.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.500
It's too much, Carla.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.500
I have to face up to my past!
So do you.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.500
Don't talk to me about the past.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.500
Stop running away and face up to it.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.500
Where's Antonio?

01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.000
- Living with me.
- What?!

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:02.000
He's living with me.
With me.

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.500
- I'm going with you.
- No, never!

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
- I must see Antonio, Bradley.
- No, never!

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:15.000
I'll take you to your family.
And that's it. Nothing more!

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
- What's going on?
- She's just praying.

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.500
Move on. Contras!

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.500
- He's with you?
- Yes, he's with me.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.500
- Well, now move!
- Yes. Thanks, man.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
The petrol is leaking.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.916
Ah, shit.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.716
Piece of shit.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.796
Give us a look.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.672
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Fuck.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.231
- Have you any soap?
- Soap?

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.276
Aye, soap.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.276
Good.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.196
Ah, it's fucking pissing out.

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.589
Ah, fuck.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.910
- Try starting her up.
- Yeah?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.956
Aye.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.556
How's that?

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.796
Yes.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:29.030
Are you sure?

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.997
Yeah, yeah, yes.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:34.629
Well, that's what a good university
education does for you.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.352
Hey!

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.118
Hi!

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.192
George.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.032
Come on.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.838
My family...

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.755
Carla? Nice bird.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.072
Aye. Aye.

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.713
- Mi nombre es Harry.
- Harry?

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.358
Harry.

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.513
Harry's a real... See, Glasgow.
It's a real Glasgow name.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:34.913
Aye. I tell you and you'll probably no'
understand this, but I fancy her. See her?

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:42.074
I fancy her and, like, she's got
a big mystery in her head and her heart.

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:48.074
I also wanted to tell you, I love your T-shirt.
Let's make a trade.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.073
What, you fancy her an' all?
Fuckin' no chance by the way, wee man.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.573
Let's swap T-shirts.
I really love yours.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.973
Take mine.
You take my Sandino T-shirt.

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:05.117
You want this T-shirt? You want my...
Fucking no problem. Take the T-shirt.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.673
You wear this with pride, son.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.513
- You give me this?
- Sí. Mi camiseta.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.717
I'll fuckin' wear that wi' pride,
I'm telling you. Sandino.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.950
Sandino. I know Sandino.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:34.913
That's...oh, great. Just watch.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.798
Fuck.

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.318
Harry!

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.500
George, no! Come back!

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:32.794
Listen, I'm erm...

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:37.294
You wanted me to be honest
with you and erm...

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.516
I have to go back.

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:52.516
But I want you to come with me, you know,
and we can take the baby.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.016
The three of us can go back. I don't care.

01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:58.016
Antonio's kid?

01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:01.016
Yes.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.436
Do you know where he is?

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.552
I do now.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.831
He live with Bradley in Esperanza.

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:16.531
Look, Carla, I don't understand, you know.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.915
I don't understand. I mean...

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.015
Do you want to be with Antonio?
Do you love him?

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.015
I don't know.

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.676
I have to go back.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:43.177
I'm going to go to Estelí, to the hostel.
And I'll stay there for one day. OK?

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:51.750
I want you to come because...
I just can't take all this killing, you know?

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:55.836
It's fucking chaos.

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:26.136
I wish the baby eas mine.

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:33.676
George.

01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:47.076
Carla.
How are you?

01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:52.076
Did you tell him everything?

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.006
No.

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:02.038
- En media hora en Estelí.
- Later. To Estelí?

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:05.789
George, let me buy you a drink!

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:07.632
I don't want fuck all off of you.

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:10.951
Come on, my Jeep's busted.
I'm stuck here and we need to talk.

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:13.634
- Why the fuck did you lie about Antonio?
- Come on!

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:17.269
- You fucking lied to me.
- Please, just come on.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.269
So what am I gonna get this time,
Goldilocks and the three fucking bears?

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:45.194
Come on.
Why can't you just tell me the truth?

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:48.511
- Say when.
- When, when. Tell me the truth.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:54.470
Plain and simple. They caught Antonio in
an ambush, tied his hands behind his back

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.391
and cut out his tongue with a knife.

01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:01.270
And then when he was lying there,
they smashed his spine with rifle butts.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.316
Plain and simple.

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:06.749
- Fuckin' animals.
- Animals, no, no.

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:10.992
They're all fuckin' animals. The ones that
came here last night are fuckin' scum.

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:14.038
Do you think they make this up
as they go along? Kid, grow up.

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.076
It all came out from Langley.

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:19.391
It was worked out ahead of time
from Langley fuckin' Virginia.

01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:22.677
Know where that is?
It's the headquarters for the CIA.

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:27.197
Central lntelligence Agency. American.
Jesus Christ, look at this.

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:30.909
- The fuckin' Nicaraguans came last night.
- Kid, that's right.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.514
One of those Contras had this in his pocket.

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:36.114
You tell me how he got this.
A satellite photo.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:41.237
Taken by US planes. All right, look at this.
School, school, school.

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:44.471
That is, I think, a healthcare centre for sure.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.710
That's a farm co-op, OK.

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:51.237
Now, wait a minute. Now, these are
attack plans those fucks had for last night.

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:53.231
They're right here, OK?

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.072
This is here, all right?

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:59.037
They came in here right over there
between those sandbags.

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.937
These are the two targets.
Shit, you don't need to look at this.

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:07.673
It's right in front of you, what's left of the
school, what's left of the healthcare centre.

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:09.716
Military targets...

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:14.398
The CIA, kid, runs this whole show.

01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:16.298
They run the whole fuckin' thing.

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:20.075
There is no Contras,
there is no war without 'em.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:24.233
You tell me what happened to Carla.
Did they rape her?

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:26.276
- No.
- Did they?

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:28.396
No.

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:34.917
When he was lying there, para lysed and
choking on what was left of his tongue...

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.514
We're talking about Antonio, OK?

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.514
They poured acid all over his face.

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.354
- Oh, Jesus.
- George, George, George, George.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:45.396
George, listen to me.

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:50.631
You know who watched
all of this, don't you?

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:53.871
Oh, fuck. God.

01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:57.071
Oh, Jesus, fuck.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.076
Is, er, Carla...?

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.776
Carla's left for Esperanza,
to see Antonio.

01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:22.076
Carla? She's here?

01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:26.076
I was surprised to see you,
I thought you'd left already.

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:29.996
- Fuck, she's no' here, Carla?
- She's gone.

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.872
- Antonio?
- Antonio.

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.598
Oh, shit.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.872
Anyway, she left a letter for you.

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.709
- Carla?
- Sí. In case you come back.

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:42.678
OK. OK.

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.713
Oh, shit.

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:50.713
I'm really sorry about what
happened between you two...

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:54.833
She's not right. She's no' well.
I need to find her. Thank you.

01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:57.033
I hope it all goes well for you.

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:04.110
Hey, Bradley! Bradley!

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.277
You need to help me, man.
She's in Esperanza.

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.874
She's gonna fuckin' do herself in.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.270
- George, what is this?
- Carla went to Esperanza to see Antonio.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.194
- She's gonna kill herself. I need your Jeep.
- It's busted. I told you.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.872
Piss!

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.916
Fuckin' bus...

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.436
- Jesus.
- Hey, George! George!

01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:33.509
George, what the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.556
Kid! Hey, hold on!

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:37.596
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.196
Come on, you fucker, move.

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:27.193
George, second house on the left. My place
is at the end, that's where Antonio is.

01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.793
- OK.
- OK.

01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.512
Hi.

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.352
Hi.

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.592
Are you OK?

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:19.549
Do you remember these?

01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.870
"This song...is special to us.

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:39.034
Altogether ask what's that.

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:44.878
I touch him once.

01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:47.996
Just once."

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:52.192
OK.

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:57.552
Come on.

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.836
Come with me.

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:57.077
- Please.
- You have to go yourself.

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.076
Come on.

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:35.350
Hey, wee man. Perfecto-fucking-mente.

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.233
Uh, she wanted you to have this.

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:53.759
Aye.

01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:58.952
So er...what did you do?

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:04.512
CIA, Juticalpa, '81 to '84, Honduras. You?

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:08.557
Bus driver, double-deckers,
number 72, Glasgow.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.790
All this stuff, man, it's hard to believe, eh?

01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:20.676
Hard to believe, George.

01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.918
Ah, parting gift.

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:38.950
Hey, Bradley.
