00:18.685 --> 00:21.312
(all gasp)

00:21.396 --> 00:23.606
Oh, God, Oh, God.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.109
This is bad. This is very bad.
I'm not supposed to be here.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.109
This is bad. This is very bad.
I'm not supposed to be here.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.944
I have a pottery class at 0900!

00:28.027 --> 00:29.988
Hey, just calm down.
We don't know what this is.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.949
Are you kidding me?! Creepy
stone walls, jagged metal bars.

00:33.032 --> 00:35.326
This has alien prison
written all over it.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.578
A prison?
Nah. No way, man.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.578
A prison?
Nah. No way, man.

00:36.661 --> 00:38.955
-This is a dungeon.
-That's even worse!

00:39.038 --> 00:41.750
Hello? Can someone give us
some context in here, please?

00:41.833 --> 00:44.544
A dungeon?! But we
didn't do anything. Did we?

00:41.833 --> 00:44.544
A dungeon?! But we
didn't do anything. Did we?

00:44.627 --> 00:45.795
(gasps)
Oh.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.839
I've been replicating
a lot of ice.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.007
Are we not supposed to do that?

00:47.922 --> 00:49.007
Are we not supposed to do that?

00:49.090 --> 00:50.300
I really like ice.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.468
I saw the captain
and the bridge crew

00:51.551 --> 00:52.635
get taken into another room.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.637
What if they
were replicating ice, too?!

00:52.719 --> 00:54.637
What if they
were replicating ice, too?!

00:54.721 --> 00:56.431
Guys, this is basically a resort

00:56.514 --> 00:57.932
compared to what
the Klingons do to you.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.309
I'm sure it's not a big...

00:59.392 --> 01:02.103

02:23.726 --> 02:25.770
-Uh, hi?

02:25.854 --> 02:27.605
they have all of our commanders

02:29.149 --> 02:31.234
-They must be on trial.

Fellow Primes!

02:34.153 --> 02:36.614
Fellow Primes!

02:36.698 --> 02:39.951
These Federation witnesses
have been brought before you

02:40.034 --> 02:41.578
to speak truth

02:41.661 --> 02:43.454
about the senior officers

02:41.661 --> 02:43.454
about the senior officers

02:43.538 --> 02:47.208
of the Federation starship
Cerritos.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.210
(murmuring)

02:47.292 --> 02:49.210
(murmuring)

02:49.294 --> 02:50.753
I-I didn't witness anything.
Did you?

02:50.837 --> 02:51.921
I don't know. What's the
difference between witnessing

02:52.005 --> 02:52.922
and just lookin' at something?

02:53.006 --> 02:56.843
You will speak only
into the Horn of Candor!

02:53.006 --> 02:56.843
You will speak only
into the Horn of Candor!

02:59.053 --> 03:02.098
With this horn,
one of our most sacred horns,

02:59.053 --> 03:02.098
With this horn,
one of our most sacred horns,

03:02.181 --> 03:05.059
you must only speak the truth.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.561
Happy to be here.
(chuckles)

03:05.143 --> 03:06.561
Happy to be here.
(chuckles)

03:06.644 --> 03:07.896
I-I don't even know
what we're supposed

03:07.979 --> 03:09.105
to be telling the truth about.

03:09.188 --> 03:11.983
The first to give testimony
will be

03:12.066 --> 03:14.736
Ensign Beckett Mariner.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.905
Ship logs state
you were present on the bridge

03:16.988 --> 03:19.908
when the Cerritos made contact
with the Clicket ship Tweerk

03:16.988 --> 03:19.908
when the Cerritos made contact
with the Clicket ship Tweerk

03:19.991 --> 03:24.245
on stardate 57818.4.

03:19.991 --> 03:24.245
on stardate 57818.4.

03:24.329 --> 03:27.373
Uh, I was, but I don't know
what you want me to...

03:27.457 --> 03:29.792
Tell us
of those wondrous events!

03:29.876 --> 03:32.420
Okay. It started off
as a usual day.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.420
Okay. It started off
as a usual day.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.964
We were just hanging out.
I mean, we were just doing work

03:35.048 --> 03:36.466
in the repair bay.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.466
in the repair bay.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.093
Roga Danar?
Are you nuts?

03:39.177 --> 03:41.429
I said "Who's
the all-time biggest badass?"

03:41.512 --> 03:43.139
not "Who's a dude
nobody's heard about?"

03:41.512 --> 03:43.139
not "Who's a dude
nobody's heard about?"

03:43.222 --> 03:44.933
Uh, everyone knows Roga Danar.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.143
-No, they don't.
-He totally outsmarted Picard,

03:47.226 --> 03:48.478
and he has amazing hair!

03:47.226 --> 03:48.478
and he has amazing hair!

03:48.561 --> 03:50.313
Well, what about Khan, right?

03:50.396 --> 03:52.815
Khan was a genetically
engineered supervillain!

03:52.899 --> 03:54.609
Dude was a space seed.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.609
Dude was a space seed.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.277
Ooh, ooh, pause for a second.
I want to talk about Khan

03:56.361 --> 03:58.321
and that thicc, thicc chest,
but I got to pee.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.657
-(door whooshes open,
alarm wailing in distance)
-Roga Danar.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.657
-(door whooshes open,
alarm wailing in distance)
-Roga Danar.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.659
-Get the (bleep) out of my face.
-(door whooshes shut)

04:02.742 --> 04:04.327
Guys, the ship's at red alert.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.411
Uh, no, it isn't.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.788
Yeah, that's impossible.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.788
Yeah, that's impossible.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.831
I messed with our speakers
so they'd be extra loud

04:08.915 --> 04:10.458
during a red alert.
We'd know for sure.

04:10.541 --> 04:13.628
You messed
with the red alert speakers?

04:10.541 --> 04:13.628
You messed
with the red alert speakers?

04:13.711 --> 04:15.088
(gasping, panting)

04:16.089 --> 04:17.464
-(alarm wailing)
-(screaming)

04:17.548 --> 04:19.384
Uh, it's, like, red alert
everywhere except here!

04:17.548 --> 04:19.384
Uh, it's, like, red alert
everywhere except here!

04:19.466 --> 04:20.510
-Rutherford!
-Aw, man.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.637
Oh, we're gonna get
in such big trouble for this.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.846
We have to get to our stations!

04:23.930 --> 04:25.390
(panting)

04:23.930 --> 04:25.390
(panting)

04:25.473 --> 04:27.517
Gah, why did we have
to have bridge duty today?

04:27.600 --> 04:28.851
We're gonna walk in
and everyone's gonna be

04:28.935 --> 04:30.895
-lookin' at us.
-No, they won't. Just chill.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.895
-lookin' at us.
-No, they won't. Just chill.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.522
Okay, we'll just explain what
happened and why we're late.

04:32.605 --> 04:33.731
It'll-it'll be fine.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.108
You want Rutherford fired?
No.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.526
Just follow my lead, all right?
We'll fake it.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.526
Just follow my lead, all right?
We'll fake it.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.027
-Fake what?!
-It!

04:38.111 --> 04:39.195
I'm not faking on the bridge.

04:39.278 --> 04:40.238
That's insane!

04:40.321 --> 04:41.531
The captain already knows
what she wants you to do,

04:41.614 --> 04:42.615
so just nod and agree with her,

04:41.614 --> 04:42.615
so just nod and agree with her,

04:42.699 --> 04:44.492
or we'll all end up
getting kicked off the ship

04:44.575 --> 04:45.493
and then we'll have
to live on Earth,

04:45.576 --> 04:46.536
where there's nothing to do
except drink wine

04:46.619 --> 04:49.038
and hang out at vineyards
and soul food restaurants!

04:46.619 --> 04:49.038
and hang out at vineyards
and soul food restaurants!

04:49.122 --> 04:51.207
(alarm continues blaring)

04:51.290 --> 04:53.376
Ugh, these guys are maniacs.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.711
Captain, what happened?

04:53.459 --> 04:54.711
Captain, what happened?

04:54.794 --> 04:57.213
They just randomly attacked me
for thanking them.

04:57.296 --> 05:00.466
(shouts)
This injustice will not stan.

04:57.296 --> 05:00.466
(shouts)
This injustice will not stan.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.510
We gave you the map,
and now you turn on us?!

05:02.593 --> 05:05.096
Captain, this is all
a misunderstanding.

05:05.179 --> 05:08.599
I simply showed gratitude for
your map of the Neutral Zone.

05:05.179 --> 05:08.599
I simply showed gratitude for
your map of the Neutral Zone.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.393
Gratitude?!
How dare you!

05:10.476 --> 05:11.561
-(quietly): Who is this guy?
-Who cares, man?

05:11.644 --> 05:12.729
Bug alien.
Roll with it.

05:11.644 --> 05:12.729
Bug alien.
Roll with it.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.230
I meant no offense.

05:14.313 --> 05:16.274
I think your people have
a different definition

05:16.357 --> 05:17.275
of "gratitude."

05:17.358 --> 05:19.402
Give us back the map!

05:17.358 --> 05:19.402
Give us back the map!

05:19.485 --> 05:21.779
Ugh, this guy is really buggin'!

05:21.863 --> 05:22.905
Mariner, what do you think?

05:22.989 --> 05:25.199
I think you know exactly how
to handle this, Captain.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.199
I think you know exactly how
to handle this, Captain.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.701
You're right about that.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.870
Ensign Boimler,
I want options.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.872
Uh, about the-- this alien guy?

05:28.953 --> 05:30.872
Uh, about the-- this alien guy?

05:30.955 --> 05:32.248
Yes. Obviously.

05:32.331 --> 05:34.792
Uh, what specifically do
you wish to know?

05:34.876 --> 05:35.918
Aw, come on, man!

05:36.002 --> 05:38.296
This is your chance to prove
you got what it takes!

05:38.379 --> 05:40.423
(clears throat) Oh! Well,
I-I don't know, uh, who, uh--

05:40.506 --> 05:41.424
Well, the truth is...

05:41.507 --> 05:42.925
Uh, I think we should do,

05:41.507 --> 05:42.925
Uh, I think we should do,

05:43.009 --> 05:45.428
uh, what you want to do, Cap'n.

05:45.511 --> 05:46.429
Cap'n's choice.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.765
I'm not asking you
to kiss my ass.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.765
I'm not asking you
to kiss my ass.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.475
Come on.
No wrong answers.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.727
Uh, okay.
We could do evasive maneuver

05:52.810 --> 05:53.728
eighty...

05:53.811 --> 05:55.646
eight...?

05:53.811 --> 05:55.646
eight...?

05:55.730 --> 05:57.440
Is he (bleep)ing serious?

05:57.523 --> 05:58.399
That was the wrong answer!

05:58.483 --> 06:00.401
-I meant 84.
-In this situation?

05:58.483 --> 06:00.401
-I meant 84.
-In this situation?

06:00.485 --> 06:02.070
-Are you crazy?
-Mariner!

06:02.153 --> 06:03.446
Have you
not been paying attention?

06:03.529 --> 06:04.447
That could get us killed.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.282
(chuckles): No, no, no, no.
I was kidding.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.282
(chuckles): No, no, no, no.
I was kidding.

06:06.365 --> 06:09.619
Let's just-- Let's use the
impulse drive to... Crazy Ivan.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.996
-Ugh! Who the hell
is he talking about?
-What in the world is that?!

06:12.080 --> 06:13.998
-What?
-That's insane.
-But-but-but-but...

06:14.082 --> 06:15.917
Son,
you're embarrassing yourself.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.169
You got a lot to learn.
Mariner,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.169
You got a lot to learn.
Mariner,

06:18.252 --> 06:20.797
why don't you send
our friends a message.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.715
Good call, Captain.

06:25.259 --> 06:26.844
-What?!
-Are you insane?!
-What the hell are you doing?!

06:26.928 --> 06:28.763
You said "Send them a message."
That means phasers!

06:28.846 --> 06:30.807
It means to send them a message
to invite them to dinner!

06:28.846 --> 06:30.807
It means to send them a message
to invite them to dinner!

06:30.890 --> 06:32.016
No, it doesn't!

06:32.100 --> 06:34.769
(grunts)
Target their bridge!

06:35.728 --> 06:37.146
-(grunting)
-CLAR: Stop! Stop!

06:35.728 --> 06:37.146
-(grunting)
-CLAR: Stop! Stop!

06:37.230 --> 06:38.481
What are you talking about?!

06:38.564 --> 06:39.857
What? I'm just telling you
what happened.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.401
You expect me to believe
a Starfleet officer

06:39.941 --> 06:42.401
You expect me to believe
a Starfleet officer

06:42.485 --> 06:44.612
wouldn't know what's going on
with their ship

06:44.695 --> 06:46.155
at all times?!

06:46.239 --> 06:48.157
Look, I'm not proud of it,
but yeah.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.157
Look, I'm not proud of it,
but yeah.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.534
What about the map?

06:49.617 --> 06:50.827
Tell me about the map!

06:50.910 --> 06:51.869
Uh, there was a map?

06:51.953 --> 06:53.830
That's the most important part!

06:53.913 --> 06:55.873
Dude, look, I work
on a spaceship, all right?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.873
Dude, look, I work
on a spaceship, all right?

06:55.957 --> 06:58.835
We don't have maps.
We have stellar cartography.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.503
What is wrong with you?!

06:58.918 --> 07:00.503
What is wrong with you?!

07:00.586 --> 07:02.505
Place her
in the Tank of Contempt!

07:02.588 --> 07:04.382
(gasping, whimpering)

07:06.384 --> 07:08.177
Oh! We got eels.
There's eels over here.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.512
Mariner's not lying!
I was there!

07:09.595 --> 07:10.680
We didn't see a map!

07:13.307 --> 07:16.435
Perhaps this is
a misunderstanding.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.396
You may go un-eeled.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.396
You may go un-eeled.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.355
For now.

07:19.438 --> 07:22.024
(whoops)
Better luck next time, eels.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.485
Why does this guy care so much
about a map of the Neutral Zone?

07:22.108 --> 07:24.485
Why does this guy care so much
about a map of the Neutral Zone?

07:24.569 --> 07:25.987
Yeah, it's so neutral.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.864
Yeah, like, what would you
even do with a map like that?

07:27.947 --> 07:29.532
(chuckles nervously)
I have no idea.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.701
Ensign Samanthan Rutherford,

07:29.615 --> 07:31.701
Ensign Samanthan Rutherford,

07:31.784 --> 07:33.411
perhaps you
can illuminate me more

07:33.494 --> 07:35.538
than your unobservant
compatriots.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.498
Um, well, I mean,
my cyborg implant

07:35.621 --> 07:37.498
Um, well, I mean,
my cyborg implant

07:37.582 --> 07:39.292
does give me perfect memory.
(chuckles)

07:39.375 --> 07:40.710
That will be of great use!

07:40.793 --> 07:46.424
Tell me of stardate 57791.1.

07:40.793 --> 07:46.424
Tell me of stardate 57791.1.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.302
All right.
Stardate 5779, eh-- Hey.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.302
All right.
Stardate 5779, eh-- Hey.

07:49.385 --> 07:50.761
Wait, are you sure
you want that one?

07:50.845 --> 07:53.723
Just 'cause I have
so many great stardates in here.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.391
Other than that one.
(chuckles)

07:53.806 --> 07:55.391
Other than that one.
(chuckles)

07:55.474 --> 07:56.893
I want the one I said!

07:56.976 --> 07:59.562
Uh, you're not gonna like it.

07:59.645 --> 08:00.563
So, there I was,

07:59.645 --> 08:00.563
So, there I was,

08:00.646 --> 08:02.356
rotating the EPS capacitors.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.900
See, they overheat
when you leave them

08:03.983 --> 08:05.067
facing one direction too long.

08:05.151 --> 08:08.112
♪ Rotate, rotate,
rotating all day long ♪

08:05.151 --> 08:08.112
♪ Rotate, rotate,
rotating all day long ♪

08:08.196 --> 08:09.655
-♪ While singing
my rotation... ♪
-Ah. There he is!

08:09.739 --> 08:11.407
Hey, sirs!
You want to rotate with me?

08:11.490 --> 08:12.658
Maybe sing a little song?

08:11.490 --> 08:12.658
Maybe sing a little song?

08:12.742 --> 08:13.743
If you heard the one earlier...
(chuckles)

08:13.826 --> 08:16.787
No! Does your implant
have Romulan flight manuals

08:16.871 --> 08:18.414
-and repair information?
-Uh, not right now.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.414
-and repair information?
-Uh, not right now.

08:18.497 --> 08:20.416
-I'd need to update it.
-Then do it. Now!

08:20.499 --> 08:23.252
Uh, well, usually I like
to update it while I'm asleep

08:23.336 --> 08:24.921
'cause it kind of messes
with my...

08:23.336 --> 08:24.921
'cause it kind of messes
with my...

08:25.004 --> 08:27.924
-No! Do it now!
-You do it right this second!

08:28.007 --> 08:30.218
-Okeydokey.
-(trilling)

08:28.007 --> 08:30.218
-Okeydokey.
-(trilling)

08:30.301 --> 08:31.886
IMPLANT:
30 seconds until restart.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.888
-Is it done yet?!
-What? No. It just started.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.431
While we wait, I'll fill you in
on the plan.

08:35.514 --> 08:37.265
Oh, uh, first off:
do you have all your shots?

08:35.514 --> 08:37.265
Oh, uh, first off:
do you have all your shots?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.684
-Wait. Which shots?
Like, with needles?
-Ten seconds.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.395
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. Let me just...

08:41.479 --> 08:43.438
We don't want you getting
Dinobulan flesh-eating bacteria

08:41.479 --> 08:43.438
We don't want you getting
Dinobulan flesh-eating bacteria

08:43.522 --> 08:45.441
-on your pe...
-Hold up just a second.
My implant is also...

08:45.524 --> 08:47.568
-It'll eat right
through your underpants.
-My what?!

08:47.652 --> 08:49.278
I've seen it happen.
Terrible way to die.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.278
I've seen it happen.
Terrible way to die.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.821
-Restarting Rutherford.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

08:50.905 --> 08:53.866
-Wait, wait, wait.
-(whirring)

08:55.159 --> 08:58.162
Whoa. I think I blacked out

08:58.246 --> 09:00.414
and lost a little bit of time
during that update.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.414
and lost a little bit of time
during that update.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.125
Great work nerve-pinching
those Vulcans, baby bear.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.086
Who knew you'd be better
at it than they are?

09:05.169 --> 09:07.171
-I did? But I don't know how
to nerve-pinch.
-Ha!

09:05.169 --> 09:07.171
-I did? But I don't know how
to nerve-pinch.
-Ha!

09:07.255 --> 09:09.298
Tell that to Spock and Spock.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.508
Oh, when my implant
was rebooting,

09:10.591 --> 09:12.009
it must have taken control.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.009
it must have taken control.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.136
We're entering the atmosphere.
Brace for turbulence.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.972
Sirs, you don't understand.
I don't know what's going on.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.808
When we're in the museum, our
window's gonna be really tight.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.808
When we're in the museum, our
window's gonna be really tight.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.977
-Museum?
-We have to deploy now!

09:21.060 --> 09:23.312
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
-(grunts)

09:23.396 --> 09:25.815
(yelling)

09:23.396 --> 09:25.815
(yelling)

09:25.898 --> 09:28.526
Verifying update. System will
restart in three seconds.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.282
(Rutherford groans)

09:34.365 --> 09:36.993
-Ah! Romulan Bird-of-Prey?
-SHAXS: Quiet!

09:34.365 --> 09:36.993
-Ah! Romulan Bird-of-Prey?
-SHAXS: Quiet!

09:37.076 --> 09:39.370
(grunting)

09:39.453 --> 09:41.622
We don't want
to draw any attention.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.292
-From who? What are we doing?
What's happening?
-Hey!

09:41.706 --> 09:44.292
-From who? What are we doing?
What's happening?
-Hey!

09:44.375 --> 09:45.668
What are you two doing
back here?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.128
You've drawn my attention.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.629
Distract him
with the fan dance!

09:47.211 --> 09:48.629
Distract him
with the fan dance!

09:48.713 --> 09:50.965
I'm sorry. My what now?

09:51.048 --> 09:54.510
-Dance, boy! Dance!
-Ooh. Ooh. Yeah.

09:51.048 --> 09:54.510
-Dance, boy! Dance!
-Ooh. Ooh. Yeah.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.137
Feels good, feels right...

09:56.220 --> 09:58.681
Hey! Stop that!
Now you're distracting me!

09:58.764 --> 10:01.976
(rhythmic grunting)
Right. Right.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.976
(rhythmic grunting)
Right. Right.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.853
I want the regular fan dance!

10:03.936 --> 10:05.021
What are you doing?!

10:05.104 --> 10:06.647
My best. (yelling)

10:05.104 --> 10:06.647
My best. (yelling)

10:06.731 --> 10:08.816
IMPLANT:
Verifying download.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.236
Aah! What the heck?!

10:10.943 --> 10:12.236
Aah! What the heck?!

10:12.320 --> 10:16.198
Hello? How am I standing
in space? (grunts)

10:16.282 --> 10:19.744
-(thudding, whooshing)
-Huh?

10:16.282 --> 10:19.744
-(thudding, whooshing)
-Huh?

10:19.827 --> 10:22.455
Ah. (laughs)

10:22.538 --> 10:25.041
Cloaked Bird-of-Prey.
Wait. Did I steal this?!

10:22.538 --> 10:25.041
Cloaked Bird-of-Prey.
Wait. Did I steal this?!

10:25.124 --> 10:27.835
-Aah, Mark Twain's got a gun!
-Billups! Oh, man, are you okay?

10:27.918 --> 10:30.338
-Tasha, no!
The garbage bag's behind you!
-Oh, no.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.338
-Tasha, no!
The garbage bag's behind you!
-Oh, no.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.214
Sir,
you have nitrogen intoxication.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.758
You only have 60 seconds
of air left!

10:33.841 --> 10:36.761
(panting, grunting)

10:33.841 --> 10:36.761
(panting, grunting)

10:36.844 --> 10:39.221
Stop goofing around!
Get in here!

10:39.305 --> 10:40.723
Verifying update.
System restart in ten second.

10:40.806 --> 10:44.226

10:40.806 --> 10:44.226
-(yelling)
-(mumbles)

10:44.310 --> 10:46.520
Watch it!
No, no, no, over there!

10:46.604 --> 10:49.690
Stupid... cloaked Bird.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.690
Stupid... cloaked Bird.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.567
(groaning)

10:51.650 --> 10:53.027
-Updating Klingon fonts.
-What?!

10:53.110 --> 10:54.445
-Why do I even need that?
-(beeping)

10:53.110 --> 10:54.445
-Why do I even need that?
-(beeping)

10:54.528 --> 10:56.030
SHAXS:
Watch out for the controls!

10:56.113 --> 10:58.240
They're set to...

11:05.873 --> 11:07.917
(gasps)
Gorn wedding!

11:05.873 --> 11:07.917
(gasps)
Gorn wedding!

11:08.000 --> 11:09.919
(growling)

11:10.002 --> 11:12.463
Aah! Get me out of here,
implant! (groans)

11:10.002 --> 11:12.463
Aah! Get me out of here,
implant! (groans)

11:12.546 --> 11:14.715
(laughs)
Nice try, Gorns!

11:18.177 --> 11:19.762
(Rutherford sighs)

11:19.845 --> 11:21.430
(yells)
It's still the Gorn wedding?

11:21.514 --> 11:24.392
Ouch. Help! Help!
Come on, Gorns, please!

11:21.514 --> 11:24.392
Ouch. Help! Help!
Come on, Gorns, please!

11:24.475 --> 11:25.726
CLAR:
A Gorn wedding?!

11:25.810 --> 11:27.770
How has this become
about a Gorn wedding?!

11:27.853 --> 11:29.397
What are you avoiding?

11:29.480 --> 11:30.773
Look, I'm just telling you
the events

11:29.480 --> 11:30.773
Look, I'm just telling you
the events

11:30.856 --> 11:32.942
of stardate 57791.1, all right?

11:33.025 --> 11:34.735
Damn. Rude.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.947
I want details on how
you stole the Bird-of-Prey!

11:34.819 --> 11:37.947
I want details on how
you stole the Bird-of-Prey!

11:38.030 --> 11:39.240
I know, man. Me, too!

11:39.323 --> 11:40.950
Wait. Why would Shaxs
make him steal

11:41.033 --> 11:43.411
some old Bird-of-Prey? What
would they even do with that?

11:41.033 --> 11:43.411
some old Bird-of-Prey? What
would they even do with that?

11:43.494 --> 11:46.330
Beats me. I mean,
it could be for anything.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.165
Like, who even knows? (laughs)

11:46.414 --> 11:48.165
Like, who even knows? (laughs)

11:48.249 --> 11:50.668
-Take him!
-(whimpers)

11:50.751 --> 11:52.420
Eels?!

11:52.503 --> 11:53.838
Dude, are you not
paying attention?

11:53.921 --> 11:56.006
-Hey! Leave them alone!
-Oh?

11:53.921 --> 11:56.006
-Hey! Leave them alone!
-Oh?

11:56.090 --> 11:57.842
Well, perhaps you,
Ensign D'vana Tendi,

11:57.925 --> 12:01.971
can prove more illuminating.

11:57.925 --> 12:01.971
can prove more illuminating.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.270
Oh, I've always wanted
to testify about stuff!

12:09.353 --> 12:10.813
This is so cool!

12:10.896 --> 12:12.273
Hi, everyone!

12:10.896 --> 12:12.273
Hi, everyone!

12:12.356 --> 12:13.732
Don't talk to them!

12:13.816 --> 12:16.318
Have you
and Commander Jack Ransom

12:16.402 --> 12:18.988
ever set foot
in the Romulan Neutral Zone?

12:16.402 --> 12:18.988
ever set foot
in the Romulan Neutral Zone?

12:19.071 --> 12:20.698
I can't tell you that.

12:20.781 --> 12:23.200
Oh, come on!
This is an easy one!

12:23.284 --> 12:25.953
Why are you making this
so difficult?

12:23.284 --> 12:25.953
Why are you making this
so difficult?

12:26.036 --> 12:28.414
-(yelling)
-Tendi, just tell him
what he wants!

12:28.497 --> 12:30.833
All right, fine! But this was
a classified mission,

12:28.497 --> 12:30.833
All right, fine! But this was
a classified mission,

12:30.916 --> 12:32.793
so I'll have
to leave some things out.

12:32.877 --> 12:36.297
I had just been given
a major assignment.

12:32.877 --> 12:36.297
I had just been given
a major assignment.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.174
Mariner! Mariner, guess what?

12:38.257 --> 12:39.842
I get to tidy
the conference rooms!

12:39.925 --> 12:41.510
Ah! What should I wear?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.304
Probably just my uniform, right?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.304
Probably just my uniform, right?

12:43.387 --> 12:45.347
Ugh! How are you so excited?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.683
You know you're just gonna be
wiping cat fur off chairs.

12:47.766 --> 12:48.809
Uh, do you know how many
big decisions happen

12:47.766 --> 12:48.809
Uh, do you know how many
big decisions happen

12:48.893 --> 12:50.060
in those conference rooms?

12:50.144 --> 12:51.353
That's where
they talk about the Borg.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.855
You can talk about the Borg
anywhere.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.191
Yeah, but when you do it
in a conference room,

12:52.938 --> 12:55.191
Yeah, but when you do it
in a conference room,

12:55.274 --> 12:58.110
it becomes a conference.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.363
(groans) I never get
to clean the conference room.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.363
(groans) I never get
to clean the conference room.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.365
(humming)

13:03.449 --> 13:05.701
(gasps)
Wow.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.411
The captain's chair.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.411
The captain's chair.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.788
Oh, I'm gonna make you
extra clean. Huh?

13:09.872 --> 13:11.582
Secure the room,
Lieutenant (bleep).

13:11.665 --> 13:13.751
-Yes, sir.
-CLAR: Okay, stop.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.751
-Yes, sir.
-CLAR: Okay, stop.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.128
You can't omit details
like that!

13:16.212 --> 13:18.672
Yeah, but I already did, so...

13:16.212 --> 13:18.672
Yeah, but I already did, so...

13:18.756 --> 13:20.674
Are you so stubborn

13:20.758 --> 13:23.427
that you're willing
to risk death by eels?

13:23.511 --> 13:25.221
Yes, that's correct.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.221
Yes, that's correct.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.848
Then continue.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.392
You must be The Cleaner.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.392
You must be The Cleaner.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.561
Yes, sirree.
And happy to be here.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.897
Glad to have you. This
mission is highly classified.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.398
From here on out,
you're (bleep)

13:34.980 --> 13:36.398
From here on out,
you're (bleep)

13:36.482 --> 13:38.275
-and (bleep).
-Wow.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.860
All right, everybody,
listen up. I'm serious.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.570
This is important.
If we're captured...

13:41.654 --> 13:43.572
TENDI:
He's glad to have me!

13:41.654 --> 13:43.572
TENDI:
He's glad to have me!

13:43.656 --> 13:46.742
Gosh, it's just so nice
to be recognized for my work.

13:46.825 --> 13:49.453
And cleaning the conference room
is important. I knew it.

13:46.825 --> 13:49.453
And cleaning the conference room
is important. I knew it.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.121
Wait, I should be
paying attention.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.290
This is why we got
matching tattoos.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.875
-10-4.
-Lock and load.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.875
-10-4.
-Lock and load.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.710
We're (bleep) for life.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.254
Check out this map.
It's gonna lead us

13:58.337 --> 14:00.756
straight into the Neutral Z...
(bleep) ...one.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.756
straight into the Neutral Z...
(bleep) ...one.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.258
The Neutral what, now?

14:02.341 --> 14:03.592
RANSOM:
The package is located here.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.262
Guards are stationed
here and here on weekends.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.262
Guards are stationed
here and here on weekends.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.098
If we run into trouble,
Cleaner will extract us.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.100
Let's (bleep) this (bleep) up!

14:11.183 --> 14:13.435
(whooping, hollering)

14:11.183 --> 14:13.435
(whooping, hollering)

14:13.519 --> 14:14.937
(whoops)
Yeah...

14:15.020 --> 14:17.982
Phaser rifles.
(chuckles)

14:18.065 --> 14:20.276
RUTHERFORD: Oh, snap!
That's the ship from my stor!

14:20.359 --> 14:22.111
TENDI: (sighs) I knew
I should have made it clear

14:22.194 --> 14:23.445
that I wasn't supposed
to be there,

14:23.529 --> 14:25.614
but every time I was about to...

14:23.529 --> 14:25.614
but every time I was about to...

14:25.698 --> 14:27.950
So, here is a very funny thing.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.620
Um, I think that there was
a misunderstanding,

14:28.033 --> 14:31.620
Um, I think that there was
a misunderstanding,

14:31.704 --> 14:34.415
-and I...
-Everyone quiet!
They're scanning the area.

14:37.876 --> 14:39.628
-Ah...
-That was close.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.297
We're lucky we have this
Bird-of-Prey, or we'd be toast.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.673
Uh, but what
I was saying was...

14:41.380 --> 14:42.673
Uh, but what
I was saying was...

14:42.756 --> 14:44.592
Shh! They're scanning again.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.762
They stopped scanning.
Cleaner, what was that?

14:46.885 --> 14:48.762
They stopped scanning.
Cleaner, what was that?

14:48.846 --> 14:52.016
-What I was saying was...
-Oh, no, they're scanning!

14:52.099 --> 14:53.851
Okay, now they're not
scanning anymore.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.519
-Anything important... Whoa!
-What I was...

14:53.934 --> 14:55.519
-Anything important... Whoa!
-What I was...

14:55.603 --> 14:57.271
REDACTED:
Stop! I'm picking up scannin!

14:57.354 --> 14:59.148
Okay, they're done scanning.
Oh, God!

14:59.231 --> 15:00.608
They're scanning again!

14:59.231 --> 15:00.608
They're scanning again!

15:00.691 --> 15:01.775
No, no. That was on me.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.944
That was wrong. No, I wasn't!

15:04.028 --> 15:05.321
(grumbles)

15:10.367 --> 15:12.620
Uh, so, a-about me
being "the cleaner..."

15:10.367 --> 15:12.620
Uh, so, a-about me
being "the cleaner..."

15:12.703 --> 15:15.706
Yeah, yeah. At your age,
it's very impressive.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.711
Comm silence from here on out.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.172
(exhales)

15:23.255 --> 15:25.841
TENDI:
Whoa.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.841
TENDI:
Whoa.

15:25.924 --> 15:28.844
-You know who I hate? Remans.
-Oh, they're the worst.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.012
-(both shouting)
-TENDI: Sorry.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.012
-(both shouting)
-TENDI: Sorry.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.430
(blows landing)

15:31.513 --> 15:33.641
Apologizing to the enemy?

15:33.724 --> 15:35.517
-That's cold, Cleaner.
-You're playing

15:35.601 --> 15:38.145
some real (bleep) up mind games.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.145
some real (bleep) up mind games.

15:44.943 --> 15:46.654
-Stay here, cover our six.
-Six what?

15:46.737 --> 15:47.946
Copy.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.325
(thudding)

15:53.452 --> 15:54.536
Is that the package?

15:53.452 --> 15:54.536
Is that the package?

15:54.620 --> 15:57.164
Cleaner, do your thing!

15:57.247 --> 15:58.916
What's my thing? I have a thing?
What's my thing?!

15:58.999 --> 16:01.502
(yelling)

15:58.999 --> 16:01.502
(yelling)

16:05.005 --> 16:07.091
Whoa, I thought she was
just supposed to beam us

16:05.005 --> 16:07.091
Whoa, I thought she was
just supposed to beam us

16:07.174 --> 16:08.842
-out of here.
-She was.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.804
I do not know what's going
on here. This is crazy.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.390
Congrats, boys.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.350
The package is safely on board,

16:16.433 --> 16:18.560
and there's no indication
that the Rom... (bleep)

16:16.433 --> 16:18.560
and there's no indication
that the Rom... (bleep)

16:18.644 --> 16:20.938
...ulan high council
detected us.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.398
-(cheering, whooping)
-Yeah!

16:22.481 --> 16:24.191
-(laughs)
-(door whooshes open)

16:22.481 --> 16:24.191
-(laughs)
-(door whooshes open)

16:24.274 --> 16:27.069
Too bad we have to deny
this ever happened,

16:27.152 --> 16:29.071
because you were awesome.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.698
(bleeping)

16:29.154 --> 16:30.698
(bleeping)

16:30.781 --> 16:32.616
(laughing):
You,

16:32.700 --> 16:34.618
you're (bleep) crazy.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.079
(door whooshes shut)

16:35.619 --> 16:37.079
(door whooshes shut)

16:37.162 --> 16:40.082
(sighs, humming)

16:40.165 --> 16:42.584
(gasps)
This is where Billups sits.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.584
(gasps)
This is where Billups sits.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.585
CLAR:
Stop!

16:43.669 --> 16:45.295
You expect me to believe that?

16:45.379 --> 16:47.256
Yes, that is where Billups sits.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.758
You did not do martial arts

16:47.339 --> 16:49.758
You did not do martial arts

16:49.842 --> 16:51.719
on multiple armed guards!

16:51.802 --> 16:54.596
You're right. I didn't.

16:51.802 --> 16:54.596
You're right. I didn't.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.641
-(clears throat)
-I tried to be reasonable.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.101
I tried to get to the truth.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.104
Today didn't have to end
in eels!

16:59.184 --> 17:02.104
Today didn't have to end
in eels!

17:02.187 --> 17:05.107
-Ignite the burners!
-(Boimler and Tendi scream)

17:05.190 --> 17:07.108
(all screaming)

17:05.190 --> 17:07.108
(all screaming)

17:07.192 --> 17:08.902
-(eels shrieking)
-Oh!

17:08.986 --> 17:12.156
Why would you have burners
and eels? It's redundant!

17:08.986 --> 17:12.156
Why would you have burners
and eels? It's redundant!

17:16.410 --> 17:20.455
Just tell me about the package.
What was inside the package?

17:16.410 --> 17:20.455
Just tell me about the package.
What was inside the package?

17:20.539 --> 17:23.208
I don't know, but whatever
it was, I'm sure it was great.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.960
(eels shrieking)

17:23.291 --> 17:24.960
(eels shrieking)

17:25.042 --> 17:27.045
I think you're hurting the eels!

17:27.128 --> 17:30.174
CLAR:
This can all be over
if you just tell me

17:27.128 --> 17:30.174
CLAR:
This can all be over
if you just tell me

17:30.257 --> 17:31.800
what your bridge crew did!

17:31.884 --> 17:33.177
We can't tell you.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.970
Why? Why?

17:35.053 --> 17:36.305
Because we don't know!

17:35.053 --> 17:36.305
Because we don't know!

17:36.388 --> 17:37.806
We never know anything!

17:37.890 --> 17:38.891
(murmuring)

17:40.559 --> 17:41.643
We're lower decks.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.645
No one ever tells us
what's going on.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.645
No one ever tells us
what's going on.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.855
We're not important enough

17:44.938 --> 17:46.440
to have anything
to lie to you about.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.984
You're Starfleet.
Surely you must be briefed

17:46.523 --> 17:48.984
You're Starfleet.
Surely you must be briefed

17:49.067 --> 17:50.152
on every contingency.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.112
Yeah, I wish.
The senior officers

17:52.196 --> 17:53.947
don't always have time
to keep us up to speed.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.658
Hell, sometimes, they don't
even know what's going on.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.452
Impossible!

17:58.535 --> 18:00.078
Human lies!

17:58.535 --> 18:00.078
Human lies!

18:00.162 --> 18:03.874
-(grunting)
-You are the best of the best!

18:03.957 --> 18:05.667
-(screams)
-Your senior officers

18:05.751 --> 18:08.462
are always in full control!

18:05.751 --> 18:08.462
are always in full control!

18:08.545 --> 18:11.340
No, they're not.
They mess up all the time.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.176
-Like whenever Q shows up.
-(all gasp)

18:11.423 --> 18:14.176
-Like whenever Q shows up.
-(all gasp)

18:14.259 --> 18:15.928
Voilà!

18:17.930 --> 18:19.973
-Oh, what?
-Damn you, Q!

18:17.930 --> 18:19.973
-Oh, what?
-Damn you, Q!

18:20.057 --> 18:23.977
Good luck solving
my little puzzle, mes amis.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.689
Tell me, now, can you prove
that humanity is worth saving?

18:27.773 --> 18:30.400
I think not.
(laughing)

18:27.773 --> 18:30.400
I think not.
(laughing)

18:32.110 --> 18:34.488
Well, he clearly wants us

18:34.571 --> 18:36.240
to play something.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.240
to play something.

18:36.323 --> 18:38.534
Ah! It's soccer. Okay.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.869
-Oh!
-BALL: What's humanity
all about?

18:40.953 --> 18:42.830
It's puzzle time.
It's puzzle time.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.830
It's puzzle time.
It's puzzle time.

18:42.913 --> 18:46.500
-Ugh. Any ideas? Anybody?
-Oh!

18:46.583 --> 18:48.210
BOIMLER:
Or half of Ransom's alien dates

18:46.583 --> 18:48.210
BOIMLER:
Or half of Ransom's alien dates

18:48.293 --> 18:49.711
that he doesn't do
any research for.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.214
(laughs)
You are so funny, Mary Anne.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.508
How about we keep this party
going in my quarters?

18:52.297 --> 18:54.508
How about we keep this party
going in my quarters?

18:54.591 --> 18:57.052
Hey. Hey, Jack. FYI, you're
hitting on a salt vampire.

18:57.135 --> 18:58.595
-(scoffs) Yeah, right. Nice try.
-(growls)

18:58.679 --> 19:00.889
Salt vampires died out
more than a century ago.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.889
Salt vampires died out
more than a century ago.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.225
-All right. Cool, be safe.
-Come on, Mary Anne.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.393
Let's get out of here.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.771
I'll give you the tour
of casa de Ransom.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.771
I'll give you the tour
of casa de Ransom.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.898
-(Mary Anne growls)
-(screams) Salt vampire!

19:09.982 --> 19:12.025
-CLAR: You're making this up.
-BOIMLER: Nuh-uh.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.025
-CLAR: You're making this up.
-BOIMLER: Nuh-uh.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.236
I read all their logs. They'e
stepping in it all the time.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.196
(panting)
Captain. Captain!

19:16.280 --> 19:17.948
Someone is replacing
everyone on the ship

19:18.031 --> 19:20.075
with imposters
who claim not to know me.

19:20.158 --> 19:21.869
We might be
in a parallel dimension.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.620
-And you are?
-Uh...

19:23.704 --> 19:25.956
Wait, is this...
is this not the Cerritos?

19:23.704 --> 19:25.956
Wait, is this...
is this not the Cerritos?

19:26.039 --> 19:29.251
This is the Alhambra.
Did you get on the wrong ship?

19:29.334 --> 19:32.254
(bleep)
They all look the same!

19:29.334 --> 19:32.254
(bleep)
They all look the same!

19:33.297 --> 19:34.923
Who the hell was that?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.758
Why are you doing this to me?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.758
Why are you doing this to me?

19:36.842 --> 19:38.260
I need you to tell me

19:38.343 --> 19:41.263
that your senior officers
are infallible heroes.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.849
Well, they're not.
And that's okay.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.849
Well, they're not.
And that's okay.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.267
We all joined Starfleet

19:45.350 --> 19:47.269
to dive headfirst
into the unknown.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.270
We're explorers.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.270
We're explorers.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.772
Of course we don't always know
what's going on.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.399
Did Picard know about the Borg?

19:52.482 --> 19:55.444
Did Kirk know about
that giant Spock on Phylos?

19:52.482 --> 19:55.444
Did Kirk know about
that giant Spock on Phylos?

19:55.527 --> 19:57.946
Did Dr. Crusher know about
that ghost in the lamp thing

19:58.030 --> 19:59.448
from the Scottish planet
that she hooked up with

19:59.531 --> 20:00.949
that one time? That whole thing.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.949
that one time? That whole thing.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.285
You clearly want us to say
that the captain

20:03.368 --> 20:04.620
and her crew messed up,

20:04.703 --> 20:06.872
but we simply don't have
the full story,

20:04.703 --> 20:06.872
but we simply don't have
the full story,

20:06.955 --> 20:08.624
and that's the truth!

20:08.707 --> 20:11.501
Whatever they did, I guarantee
you it was all for good.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.962
You have shown no evidence
that they're guilty of a crime.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.962
You have shown no evidence
that they're guilty of a crime.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.797
In fact, I find you guilty

20:15.881 --> 20:18.800
of trying to take them down
with this sham of a trial!

20:15.881 --> 20:18.800
of trying to take them down
with this sham of a trial!

20:18.884 --> 20:20.177
Drumhead!

20:22.054 --> 20:25.098
Wait, you think this is a trial?

20:22.054 --> 20:25.098
Wait, you think this is a trial?

20:25.182 --> 20:26.850
Uh, yes?

20:26.934 --> 20:28.143
-It's not?
-Yeah, I mean,
it's pretty trial-y.

20:28.226 --> 20:29.645
Could someone
bring up the lights?

20:33.190 --> 20:34.608
This isn't a trial.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.152
It's a party,
for this brave crew

20:34.691 --> 20:37.152
It's a party,
for this brave crew

20:37.235 --> 20:39.613
who rescued me
from the Romulans.

20:39.696 --> 20:40.822
What?

20:40.906 --> 20:43.283
CLAR:
I was kidnapped by Romulans

20:40.906 --> 20:43.283
CLAR:
I was kidnapped by Romulans

20:43.367 --> 20:46.036
and held for over a year
until they saved me.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.665
Imperium Magistrate Clar, you're
safe now, aboard the Cerritos.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.665
Imperium Magistrate Clar, you're
safe now, aboard the Cerritos.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.876
Thank you, Captain Freeman.
Thank you.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.296
You must come and celebrate
with me on K'Tuevon Prime.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.296
You must come and celebrate
with me on K'Tuevon Prime.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.675
Your deeds and my victory
will forever be etched

20:59.758 --> 21:02.970
-onto our great history stone.
-Can't say no to a party.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.970
-onto our great history stone.
-Can't say no to a party.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.347
Oh, great, guess I'll have
to shave my (bleep).

21:05.430 --> 21:06.682
Yeah, maybe you should.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.682
Yeah, maybe you should.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.517
(laughter)

21:08.600 --> 21:10.185
(scoffs)
What's that about?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.145
I don't know, man.
Something dumb.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.145
I don't know, man.
Something dumb.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.147
(both laugh)

21:14.231 --> 21:16.858
This was supposed
to be my special day.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.360
No. No, no, no, no, no.
This is a trial.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.360
No. No, no, no, no, no.
This is a trial.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.736
You said we were witnesses,

21:19.820 --> 21:22.030
-you said we had to testify.
-Are you stupid?

21:22.114 --> 21:23.865
How could you think
this was a trial?

21:23.949 --> 21:27.369
Because you've got our bosses
suspended in a scary-ass beam.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.369
Because you've got our bosses
suspended in a scary-ass beam.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.997
That is the beam of celebration!

21:30.080 --> 21:32.374
It is an honor
to be in this beam.

21:32.457 --> 21:33.542
Shut up, Billups!

21:33.625 --> 21:35.043
Hey, man, this is not on us.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.046
I mean, all of that chanting,
and the-the metal gavel?

21:35.127 --> 21:38.046
I mean, all of that chanting,
and the-the metal gavel?

21:38.130 --> 21:39.881
This is, like, alien trial 101.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.676
You raised us up on a platform
into a creepy courtroom.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.676
You raised us up on a platform
into a creepy courtroom.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.220
Creepy? This is one
of our nicest event silos.

21:45.303 --> 21:47.723
-I got married here!
-Wh-- Well, then,
who's this judge?

21:47.806 --> 21:50.726
This guy's just been, like,
scowling at us the whole time.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.726
This guy's just been, like,
scowling at us the whole time.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.936
-I don't know him.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm just here

21:53.020 --> 21:55.022
to set up for a birthday later
for my little girl.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.022
to set up for a birthday later
for my little girl.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.357
-She's turning 100.
-TENDI: Aw.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.068
Okay, all right, Clar,
time's up.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.068
Okay, all right, Clar,
time's up.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.195
-Etchers down.
-But-but...

22:02.279 --> 22:04.072
we didn't even get
to do any etching.

22:04.156 --> 22:07.159
No, no, no, no. You only paid
for 22 minutes.

22:04.156 --> 22:07.159
No, no, no, no. You only paid
for 22 minutes.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.577
Other people got to etch.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.661
Oh, come on.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.955
But-but wh-- Okay, what about,
what about the eels?

22:12.039 --> 22:14.374
You held us in contempt,
of eels.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.043
All right, come on.
That's enough.

22:16.126 --> 22:17.252
-You dipped us in eels!
-You ruined my party!

22:17.336 --> 22:19.087
Those were eels
you dipped us in!

22:17.336 --> 22:19.087
Those were eels
you dipped us in!

22:19.171 --> 22:21.131
-You did that! You did it!
-You ruined my party!

22:23.216 --> 22:26.720
Today you four almost
got yourselves killed

22:23.216 --> 22:26.720
Today you four almost
got yourselves killed

22:26.803 --> 22:28.430
at a thank-you dinner.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.223
But, the way you stood up
for Starfleet

22:28.513 --> 22:30.223
But, the way you stood up
for Starfleet

22:30.307 --> 22:31.933
while you thought you were
staring death in the face

22:32.017 --> 22:33.935
deserves commendation.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.146
-I guess.
-(applause)

22:34.019 --> 22:36.146
-I guess.
-(applause)

22:37.355 --> 22:38.774
Going forward,
we'll make an effort

22:38.857 --> 22:40.734
to keep the crew more informed.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.779
The Cerritos will be
synonymous with clarity.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.779
The Cerritos will be
synonymous with clarity.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.947
Wait, so then what did
Clar do to get captured

22:46.031 --> 22:48.241
by the Romulans?
I-I missed that part.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.241
by the Romulans?
I-I missed that part.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.910
(chuckles)
Well, it's-it's complicated.

22:49.993 --> 22:52.079
Why did you let him
hurt us with eels

22:52.162 --> 22:54.122
if you knew it wasn't a trial?

22:52.162 --> 22:54.122
if you knew it wasn't a trial?

22:54.206 --> 22:56.458
We have to honor the local
customs of alien governments.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.001
And can you tell me
who was on that secret team

22:58.085 --> 22:59.252
that infiltrated
the Neutral Zone?

22:59.336 --> 23:01.421
Uh, I'm not at liberty to...

22:59.336 --> 23:01.421
Uh, I'm not at liberty to...

23:01.505 --> 23:03.256
And why couldn't you just ask
the Vulcans to borrow

23:03.340 --> 23:04.633
the Bird-of-Prey?
And where did they get it?

23:04.716 --> 23:06.426
And why was that a job
for the Cerritos?

23:04.716 --> 23:06.426
And why was that a job
for the Cerritos?

23:06.510 --> 23:07.969
Why couldn't it have just been
a job for, like, the Enterprise,

23:08.053 --> 23:09.638
-or...
-Okay, you know what?
It's classified.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.598
It's all classified. Dismissed!

23:11.681 --> 23:14.267
Hey, everybody, look, we got
Captain Clarity over here.

23:11.681 --> 23:14.267
Hey, everybody, look, we got
Captain Clarity over here.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.602
I said dismissed!

23:15.685 --> 23:19.564
Honestly, this is fine with me.
Knowing things means more work.

23:15.685 --> 23:19.564
Honestly, this is fine with me.
Knowing things means more work.

23:19.648 --> 23:22.150
Well, I, for one, knew
it was a party the whole time.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.527
(scoffs)
Yeah, right, dude.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.153
-I did.
-Then why were you crying?

23:23.610 --> 23:25.153
-I did.
-Then why were you crying?

23:25.237 --> 23:27.155
I just-- i-it was cold in there.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.491
I've got sensitive corneas.
I told you.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.201
(laughs)

23:29.574 --> 23:31.201
(laughs)

23:31.284 --> 23:33.203
I challenge you all to a duel.

23:33.286 --> 23:34.454
Pick your weapons.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.039
I pick the mind.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.039
I pick the mind.

23:36.123 --> 23:36.915
Get out of here, Q! No.

23:36.998 --> 23:38.667
We are done
with random stuff today.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.752
We're not dealing
with any of your Q bull(bleep).

23:40.836 --> 23:42.170
Oh, s'il vous plaît, Mariner.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.170
Oh, s'il vous plaît, Mariner.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.131
I want to put humanity
to the ultimate test.

23:44.214 --> 23:45.465
MARINER:
Okay, I'm not French. No.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.175
-Go find Picard.
-Q: Oh, Picard.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.594
He's no fun, he's always
quoting Shakespeare,

23:47.259 --> 23:49.594
He's no fun, he's always
quoting Shakespeare,

23:49.678 --> 23:51.638
he's always making wine.
