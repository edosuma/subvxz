00:07.004 --> 00:08.368
Previously on E.R.

00:08.369 --> 00:11.647
I just wanna thank you, for setting
the bar high, for everything.

00:11.648 --> 00:15.398
I've got that "guy about to be divorced"
look all over me.

00:18.025 --> 00:20.260
- Cute.
- Raul?

00:20.261 --> 00:21.951
You're not his type.

00:22.397 --> 00:25.640
You're not my father.
A father is someone who was there.

00:25.641 --> 00:27.575
You never were.

00:27.576 --> 00:30.896
- Rematch. Two out of three.
- What do you wanna play for?

00:31.097 --> 00:33.833
Tickets to the Bulls game.
One for each of us, all right?

00:36.355 --> 00:37.305
You're on.

00:37.319 --> 00:41.649
- Unit 47 to Dispatch.
- Roger, 47, this is Dispatch.

00:41.684 --> 00:45.563
Heading back to quarters from Mercy
for relief. ETA is seven minutes.

00:45.730 --> 00:49.230
- Roger, 47. What's your location?
- Northbound on Racine and Webster.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.982
Roger, 47. Stand by please.

00:52.149 --> 00:53.982
Buy you breakfast?

00:54.149 --> 00:56.441
- Wiener Circle?
- For breakfast?

00:56.608 --> 00:59.818
Come on!
Char dog, extra peppers, cheese!

00:59.985 --> 01:03.860
Unit 47, respond to residential building
fire at North Ravenswood and Nelson.

01:04.027 --> 01:06.736
- Neighbors report occupants trapped.
- Dispatch, this is 47.

01:06.903 --> 01:08.821
We' re dead,
heading back to Station 134.

01:08.988 --> 01:13.322
- Any other units who can fill?
- Multiple units are requested, 47.

01:16.365 --> 01:17.740
I can use the overtime.

01:19.116 --> 01:24.159
- Unit 47 responding to the scene.
- That's 47 to the scene at 6:18.

01:25.493 --> 01:27.744
It's a fire. At least we'll be warm.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.544 --> 01:54.671
Yeah. Thanks for letting
Aunt Susie sleep. You're so good.

01:55.254 --> 02:00.173
Oh, yes you are. And you're wet.

02:00.339 --> 02:03.299
Yeah. Okay. I know.

02:04.132 --> 02:06.716
Yep. Today's the big day.

02:10.300 --> 02:15.136
Are you nervous?
Are you nervous? Are you?

02:15.303 --> 02:21.138
Well, I'm a wreck. You'll be great.
I'll probably blow the whole thing.

02:21.305 --> 02:27.265
Do you want to go take a bath together?
A nice, warm bath.

02:27.432 --> 02:31.100
Dispatch, this is 47. We're first on
the scene at Ravenswood and Nelson.

02:31.267 --> 02:35.101
Third story occupied.
Heavy fire showing second floor.

02:44.521 --> 02:48.231
- Hey, is everybody out of there?
- I didn't see anybody come out.

02:48.398 --> 02:52.608
There was this big explosion. Just went
"Boom! " about two, three minutes ago.

02:52.774 --> 02:55.942
- People living in there?
- Yeah. They come and go all the time.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.110
I think they're selling drugs in there.

03:04.529 --> 03:07.363
Back, everybody! Back!
Move back, everybody!

03:09.323 --> 03:11.656
Move back, everybody! Hey!

03:23.786 --> 03:27.203
Is anybody else in there?
Is there anybody in there?

03:33.081 --> 03:35.206
Shep!

03:36.623 --> 03:38.207
Help me!

03:43.960 --> 03:46.085
Get his legs! Get his legs!

03:47.877 --> 03:50.254
Roll him! Roll him!

03:51.337 --> 03:56.089
- Help me, somebody, please.
- Get away from the building now!

03:56.256 --> 03:59.799
- No! My babies are in there!
- How many?

03:59.966 --> 04:02.925
- Three.
- Where are they?

04:03.092 --> 04:05.676
- On the second floor in the back!
- Okay, all right.

04:05.843 --> 04:07.093
Please get them!

04:07.260 --> 04:11.427
Go over there with your child.
Ambulances are on their way. Go! Go!

04:12.804 --> 04:15.721
- Raul, we got three kids up there!
- Trucks are on their way.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.596
- They're gonna be here in seconds.
- Second floor in the back!

04:18.764 --> 04:21.055
Shep, don't! Shep! Shep!

04:22.140 --> 04:26.475
Dispatch, Unit 47 at Ravenswood fire.
Three kids, second floor in the rear.

04:26.642 --> 04:30.977
We're going in for a rescue attempt.
Have the first two engines back us up.

05:29.122 --> 05:30.873
I feel funny about taking it off.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.291
She filed for divorce and lives
with another guy.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.666
- Morning.
- Morning.

05:35.833 --> 05:38.500
I guarantee you,
she's not wearing hers...

05:38.667 --> 05:41.460
...while she's digging postholes
in bed with what's-his-name.

05:41.627 --> 05:44.503
I don't need any more mental images
of Jennifer's new sex life.

05:44.669 --> 05:46.670
My imagination is
already working overtime.

05:46.837 --> 05:49.630
You asked me why women
don't seem to be interested in you...

05:49.796 --> 05:52.173
...and I said that women
do not respond well...

05:52.340 --> 05:55.591
...to guys who come onto them
while they're wearing their wedding ring.

05:55.757 --> 06:00.009
Randi. You meet a cute guy for
the first time. What do you do?

06:00.176 --> 06:02.885
- Run a credit check.
- Normal women check on rings.

06:03.052 --> 06:07.094
If he's not, look for that "I'm married,
but it's in my pocket" indentation.

06:07.261 --> 06:10.512
I'm telling you. Throw it in the river.
Throw the ring in the river.

06:10.679 --> 06:12.847
Doug. Six-year-old with a flu.
Curtain 3.

06:13.014 --> 06:14.222
Okay.

06:14.389 --> 06:16.347
- Can you have dinner tonight?
- No, I can't.

06:16.514 --> 06:19.557
Here I am, pouring out my heart
about how I can't get a date...

06:19.724 --> 06:22.683
...and you're gonna have dinner
with the KLM flight crew.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.518
Bulls game with my dad.

06:25.684 --> 06:27.852
- Since when did they get so close?
- They aren't.

06:28.019 --> 06:31.103
They've seen each other a couple
of times. Doug's trying though.

06:31.270 --> 06:34.396
Oh, man. I can't believe this.
They cut my shifts back again.

06:34.563 --> 06:37.355
- I may as well work part-time.
- I have eight shifts a month.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.773
Been moonlighting
as a per diem for a temp agency.

06:39.939 --> 06:41.274
- Better money anyway.
- Really?

06:41.441 --> 06:46.775
- Yeah. Overtime, no paperwork...
- Where's Susan? She hasn't signed in.

06:46.942 --> 06:48.943
Appointment. She called,
said she'd be late.

06:49.110 --> 06:51.318
Appointment?
What kind of appointment?

06:52.528 --> 06:55.028
- This is County. Go ahead.
- This is Unit 92.

06:55.195 --> 06:56.946
We're en route from a building fire...

06:57.113 --> 07:00.322
...with a 20-year-old male, extensive
second- and third-degree burns.

07:00.488 --> 07:04.115
Couldn't get a line or intubate.
Multiple victims at scene.

07:04.282 --> 07:06.824
- What have we got?
- Crispy critters. How many?

07:06.991 --> 07:10.701
- Three majors, two minors, so far.
- So far?

07:10.867 --> 07:14.702
Still pulling them out. All coming your
way, County. Our ETA's four minutes.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.078
We'll be waiting.

07:16.244 --> 07:18.954
Randi, page Susan.
Tell her to get here soon.

07:19.121 --> 07:23.372
Notify the Burn Unit, find Benton. Make
sure that we have plenty of Silvadene.

07:23.539 --> 07:27.957
- And Ringer's lactate.
- Man, I hate burn cases.

07:29.499 --> 07:32.625
- Sorry. I know it's here somewhere.
- Need to use the phone?

07:32.792 --> 07:35.751
No. It's just my work
trying to find me.

07:35.918 --> 07:39.711
- So you were saying about the visit?
- Your home visit went very well.

07:39.878 --> 07:44.046
Ms. Pearline expressed concern
about your hours during your Residency.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.964
I'm trying to cut back.

07:46.130 --> 07:49.173
But biological-relation adoptions are
simple procedures.

07:49.340 --> 07:51.757
Frankly, short of finding you
in the midst of an animal sacrifice...

07:51.924 --> 07:54.508
...I doubt anything could have
slowed your petition.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.134
- That's good news.
- Have you located your sister?

07:57.384 --> 08:02.053
I got a Christmas card postmarked
from Flagstaff. No return address.

08:02.219 --> 08:06.429
- There's no phone listing.
- It's been five months?

08:06.596 --> 08:09.347
- What about the father?
- I put ads in the paper.

08:10.305 --> 08:13.057
The judge'll terminate their birthrights,
then your attorney...

08:13.223 --> 08:16.099
- ... can have the adoption order entered.
- That's it?

08:16.266 --> 08:20.434
Except for a lifetime of homework
projects and boyfriends, yes.

08:21.976 --> 08:24.894
Approximately 20-year-old male,
ran from building with clothes on fire.

08:25.061 --> 08:27.895
Extensive second- and third-degree
burns. Singed nasal hair.

08:28.062 --> 08:31.480
Unable to start an IV or take BP.
Third-degree burns to all extremities.

08:31.647 --> 08:33.313
Weak carotid pulse at 150.

08:33.481 --> 08:36.190
- Carol, get Susan down here.
- She won't answer her page.

08:36.357 --> 08:38.732
Building caught on fire.
Just blew up. Meth lab.

08:38.899 --> 08:41.900
Pieces of pressure cookers
and chemical burners just blew up.

08:42.067 --> 08:45.068
Six engines, three truck companies.
We grabbed this guy and ran.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.569
Easy, now, and go.

08:49.652 --> 08:54.071
Let's get a blood gas and a CO level.
CBC, Chem-20, portable chest.

08:54.321 --> 08:57.572
- Oh, God!
- Two cut down trays. Carter! Doug!

08:57.739 --> 08:59.740
- Cut down where?
- Femorally. You take the right.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.908
- Number 10 blade, Curved Kelly.
- I'm doing an RSl.

09:03.074 --> 09:08.035
- Pulse 65 percent on 100 percent O-2.
- Pulse 144, weak and thready.

09:08.201 --> 09:11.744
- Incise him and thread the IV in.
- Directly into the vein?

09:11.910 --> 09:14.579
Children were in that building.
Adults left them there.

09:14.746 --> 09:16.163
- How many kids?
- At least three.

09:16.330 --> 09:19.330
Forty-seven got there first.
They went in there after them.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.080
- Veck, 10 migs. Veck!
- Unit 47?

09:21.330 --> 09:23.832
Second floor collapsed. We're headed
back. Lots of firemen are in trouble.

09:23.999 --> 09:27.416
-7.5. Apply cricoid pressure.
- Did 47 get out?

09:27.583 --> 09:30.750
- Lydia! 7.5, please!
- I think one of them did.

09:30.917 --> 09:33.627
- Who's 47?
- Shepard and Melendez.

09:34.377 --> 09:36.670
- Got it!
- Another one, 8-year-old.

09:36.837 --> 09:39.170
- I'll finish. Doug, take it.
- Somebody should tell Carol.

09:39.337 --> 09:40.588
I will.

09:41.255 --> 09:43.797
Eight-year-old girl. 18 percent
second-degree arms, back and leg.

09:43.964 --> 09:45.506
- Third-degree thigh.
- The airway?

09:45.673 --> 09:47.965
Singed nasal hair, nonproductive cough.

09:48.257 --> 09:50.758
BP 110/70, pulse 112. Resps 24.

09:50.925 --> 09:54.093
Two IVs going, normal saline,
O-210 liters by mask.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.302
- It hurts!
- You're gonna be okay, sweetheart.

09:57.468 --> 09:59.553
- I want my mom.
- Do you know where her parents are?

09:59.720 --> 10:02.554
- Not a clue.
- All right, here we go.

10:02.721 --> 10:05.888
On my count. Ready?
Here we go. One, two, three.

10:07.013 --> 10:10.181
Blood gas with carbon monoxide level,
CBC, PT.

10:10.348 --> 10:15.100
PTT, Chem-20, chest x-ray,
urinalysis and urine myoglobin.

10:16.309 --> 10:19.269
Carol, Shep and Raul may
have got caught in the fire.

10:19.435 --> 10:21.269
- What?
- Forty-seven was first on scene.

10:21.435 --> 10:24.145
They went in after some kids.
One may be caught inside.

10:24.311 --> 10:26.604
- Which one?
- I don't know.

10:26.813 --> 10:30.356
We may have a laryngeal burn here.
Give me fiber-optic laryngoscope.

10:30.523 --> 10:33.607
A couple of paramedics from Station
134 drive 47. You know them?

10:33.773 --> 10:36.692
- The ones who pulled out the kids?
- I don't know. Are they okay?

10:36.858 --> 10:40.526
We scooped and ran. It was chaos.
But units behind us might know.

10:40.692 --> 10:43.443
Another run, ETA three minutes.
Carol, you find Susan?

10:43.610 --> 10:46.278
- I beeped her 911.
- Run down Benton.

10:46.444 --> 10:49.029
We're in over our heads
down here already.

- One amp epi, atropine one mig.
- They're here, Dr. Greene.

11:03.326 --> 11:05.409
Malik, why don't you help them
down front.

11:05.576 --> 11:09.453
Lily, find out if Doug's done next door.
Where the hell is Benton?

11:10.079 --> 11:12.621
We have to make sure
your throat isn't burned.

11:12.788 --> 11:15.330
- More coming in. Can you take them?
- Not yet.

11:15.497 --> 11:17.623
Triage the new arrivals,
give us a breakdown.

11:17.790 --> 11:22.249
- Lily, I'll do it. You stay with Doug.
- Carol, you're gonna be just fine.

11:29.752 --> 11:31.711
- Where do you want him?
- In 3.

11:31.878 --> 11:34.295
Twelve-year-old boy.
Smoke Inhalation. Name's Max.

11:34.462 --> 11:36.296
Jerry, take Max to Exam 1.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.297
Tell the nurse to put him on
100 percent O-2. Get Benton down here!

11:39.464 --> 11:42.381
- He's still in surgery.
- Get him out! What else have you got?

11:42.548 --> 11:46.133
Fireman, first- and second-degree
burns to trunk and arms. Vitals normal.

11:46.300 --> 11:50.301
Malik, I want him in Curtain Area 2.
And get him an order for Demerol.

11:50.468 --> 11:53.802
- Did you see a couple of guys from 47?
- They got one out.

11:53.969 --> 11:56.678
- He should be in a unit behind us.
- What have we got?

11:56.845 --> 11:59.804
- Second- and third-degree burns.
- Go!

11:59.971 --> 12:02.430
- Which one?

12:03.097 --> 12:06.515
- Randi! What's the next ETA?
- Less than a minute.

12:06.682 --> 12:10.058
- They're loading two more on the scene.
- Coming through!

12:47.989 --> 12:51.322
- Jerry! What the hell is going on?
- There was a fire. A big one.

12:51.489 --> 12:54.199
Susan, Mark's been yelling for you.
We need help in Trauma.

12:54.366 --> 12:56.658
- I got to get Susie up to daycare.
- I'll take her.

12:56.825 --> 12:59.284
- Thank you.
- Go! Go!

13:00.368 --> 13:03.828
Wendy's gonna take you upstairs.
I'll check in on you, all right, darling?

13:03.994 --> 13:06.245
- Do you need a hand?
- No, check with Mark in 1.

13:06.412 --> 13:08.413
- Have you seen Carol?
- She's still out back.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.246
All right, you got her?

13:13.789 --> 13:16.790
- What can I do?
- Not much now.

13:16.957 --> 13:19.625
- Asystole. How long?
-22 minutes.

13:19.791 --> 13:21.792
Okay, Carter. That's it. Call it.

13:23.584 --> 13:25.669
- Pronounced 8:20.
- Where have you been?

13:25.836 --> 13:28.753
- I had an appointment. It ran over.
- You were on at 7.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.754
- I told Weaver I'd be here at 8.
- Yeah, it's 8:30.

13:31.921 --> 13:33.171
It's 8:20.

13:34.630 --> 13:37.048
Cover him up. Take him to holding.
We need the room.

13:37.214 --> 13:40.174
- Mark, I'm sorry. It was really important.
- So is your job.

13:48.843 --> 13:50.219

- No.

13:50.386 --> 13:51.636

13:57.055 --> 13:59.014

- Did you hear about Unit 47?
- One saved this kid. He's in Unit 92.

14:03.349 --> 14:05.016
It's here. Go!

14:10.810 --> 14:13.811
Pulled two kids out. Went in again
for the last one. Floor gave way.

14:13.977 --> 14:17.479
He fell 10 feet, landed on his legs.
Dragged himself to the front.

14:17.646 --> 14:20.438
Still had the kid with him.
Soft-tissue swelling, right knee.

14:20.605 --> 14:22.356
- Which one is it?
- Shepard.

14:22.522 --> 14:24.648
- Where's Melendez?
- They haven't found him yet.

- Any shortness of breath?
- No, I'm okay.

14:49.741 --> 14:54.950
- The floor went out from under us.
- You got to keep that mask on.

14:55.117 --> 14:58.243
- I had hold of that kid.
- The mask.

14:59.744 --> 15:02.536
Raul was right behind me.
They got to find him.

15:02.703 --> 15:05.246

15:12.332 --> 15:16.500

Hyperventilate him.

15:47.428 --> 15:49.845
- Ventilator flying in.

15:50.012 --> 15:53.096

Reilly, get the hell out of the way.
Move. Clear.

16:15.855 --> 16:18.772
- Neck hurt?
- No. Kid's okay?

16:18.939 --> 16:21.690
- Any pain?
- Yeah, my ribs hurt a little.

16:21.856 --> 16:24.816

16:24.983 --> 16:28.192
- We're taking care of them right now.
- Raul was right behind me.

16:28.359 --> 16:31.276
- We were on the second floor.
- Stop moving your head.

16:31.443 --> 16:35.612
Last kid was in a closet. We'd almost
given up, then Raul found him.

16:35.778 --> 16:37.862
- We just wanted to get the hell out.
- Pain?

16:38.029 --> 16:39.405
- Yeah.
- What about here?

16:39.571 --> 16:44.198
No, I'm okay. I thought we could make it
down the stairs. The hall was going up.

16:44.365 --> 16:46.449
- I'm touching you here. Do you feel it?
- Yeah.

16:46.616 --> 16:49.283
- Okay, wiggle your toes.
- He was right there.

16:49.450 --> 16:53.243
I was looking at him. There was a big
noise, and then I'm falling with the kid.

16:53.409 --> 16:56.202
Dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibial pulses are intact.

16:56.369 --> 17:00.371
They got to find Raul. He was
right behind me. He's right there.

17:00.538 --> 17:02.038
Okay, they're trying.

Bringing him in now.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.252
They found him!

17:19.877 --> 17:23.712
That's great. That's great.

17:23.878 --> 17:26.922
They found him. Oh, that's good.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.714
- Short of breath?
- No.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.548
- Coughing?

17:30.715 --> 17:33.466

- Yeah, but it's pretty clear.

17:33.633 --> 17:36.383
Portable chest, blood gas with CO level.

17:36.550 --> 17:39.509
100 percent oxygen by nonrebreather
mask. You're gonna be fine.

17:39.676 --> 17:42.219
They found Melendez.
He was on the second floor.

17:42.469 --> 17:44.470
Second floor?

17:45.012 --> 17:48.554
Yeah. Those paramedics
didn't have any gear.

17:49.513 --> 17:53.556
They went in anyway.
Every one of those kids would be dead.

17:55.724 --> 18:00.184

Who has a hyperbaric chamber?

18:12.855 --> 18:15.689
- University of Chicago.

18:15.856 --> 18:17.899
Tell him to get his chopper here now!

18:20.566 --> 18:25.192
Found him trapped inside, ALOC.
Extensive partial, full-thickness burns.

18:27.360 --> 18:30.445

Not able to get an IV. No place for
BP cuff, faint carotid pulse at 160.

18:38.448 --> 18:40.740
Nice and gentle. One, two, three.

18:40.906 --> 18:43.741
Blood gas with CO level,
CBC, PT, PTT.

18:43.907 --> 18:47.451
Portable chest. Put in a Foley,
get a UA and urine myoglobin.

18:47.617 --> 18:50.827
- It hurts a lot.
- I know. That's what we're working on.

18:51.660 --> 18:53.661
- Can you do a cutdown?
- Neck's not burned.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.871
All right. Internal jugular, let's go!

18:56.037 --> 18:58.621
Let's get moist dressings on!

18:58.788 --> 19:00.914
Gentlemen, you're gonna have
to wait outside.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.331
- Doc!
- Mark!

19:03.498 --> 19:06.874
- How bad?
- It's too early to say.

19:07.041 --> 19:08.375
Please.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.836
It's bad.

19:15.003 --> 19:16.545
Is Shep okay?

19:16.712 --> 19:19.003
He broke a couple of ribs.
He's mad as hell.

19:20.003 --> 19:22.922
Morphine five, IV push!
Let's get that Ringer's going.

19:23.089 --> 19:25.047
X- ray flying in.

19:27.590 --> 19:30.091
- What the hell's going on?
- They're examining him.

19:30.258 --> 19:33.300
- Is he okay?
- I can't tell from here.

19:33.467 --> 19:35.218
- Shooting!
- What was that?

19:35.385 --> 19:37.385
They're taking an x-ray.

19:38.719 --> 19:42.637
- Get me off this board. I want to see.
- You also want to be able to walk.

19:42.804 --> 19:45.930
- Take it off!
- You can have a broken neck.

19:46.097 --> 19:49.098
If you do that one more time,
I put you in restraints.

19:49.390 --> 19:52.599
CO level's normal. PO-2112.
PCO-232.

19:52.766 --> 19:55.934
- Let's move him to Radiology.
- No, I want to stay.

19:56.101 --> 20:00.435
- You're going.
- No, I want to stay! Carol! Please!

20:00.602 --> 20:03.436
There's nothing you can do.
We must make sure you're okay.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.104
Carol, I need to know.

20:10.272 --> 20:11.898
- Will you stay with him?
- You bet.

20:12.065 --> 20:14.357
- I'll go find out.
- And you'll come right back?

20:14.524 --> 20:16.107
I promise.

20:16.274 --> 20:18.775
Tell him that I thought
he was right behind me.

20:18.942 --> 20:21.068
Tell him I didn't leave him there!

20:21.235 --> 20:23.318
Tell him I didn't leave him there!

20:28.820 --> 20:30.821
Excuse me, guys.

20:37.865 --> 20:39.866
Grab an ABG while you're down there.

20:40.408 --> 20:43.950
Hook it up to the transducer.
Good. We're in business.

20:44.117 --> 20:46.786
- BP is 70/30.
- Open it wide.

20:46.951 --> 20:49.495
- Is he conscious?
- Yeah.

20:49.661 --> 20:51.454
Hey, Raul.

20:52.204 --> 20:55.205
Hi. It's Carol.

20:56.039 --> 20:58.122
How are you doing?

21:03.917 --> 21:06.375
How extensive are the burns?

21:07.792 --> 21:11.919
Eighty-five to 90 percent.
Mostly third-degree.

21:14.712 --> 21:16.379
Oh, my God.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.716
Malik, let's do laryngoscopy.

21:46.599 --> 21:47.932
Excuse me.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.642
- How's he doing?
- Not so good. Coming through!

21:53.767 --> 21:56.518
Anything I can do to help?

21:56.685 --> 22:02.495

PCO-250 on 15 liters.

22:02.562 --> 22:05.188
- Respiratory rate, 40 and rising.
- No edema.

22:05.439 --> 22:07.814
That's good, Raul.
His breathing is labored.

22:07.981 --> 22:10.773
He has a circumferential burn of the
chest. He needs an escharotomy.

22:10.940 --> 22:12.941
- Where's Burn Unit?
- Finishing up a little girl.

22:13.108 --> 22:18.318
Carter and I can do it. Prep and drape.
Number 10 blade. Let's go, move.

22:21.611 --> 22:23.695
- How are the kids?
- One was touch-and-go.

22:23.861 --> 22:27.613
I sent him to the University of Chicago
for some hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.947
The other two are okay.
Girls will need grafts.

22:30.155 --> 22:31.489
Any parents yet?

22:31.656 --> 22:36.157
Mother left with an injured toddler. APBs
are out. She hasn't been to a hospital.

22:36.324 --> 22:38.367
- I'm gonna keep Raul company.
- How's Shep?

22:38.617 --> 22:41.493
Multiple rib fractures,
knee sprains, burns. He's up in Ortho.

22:41.660 --> 22:45.161
Dr. Greene? There's a bunch of guys
out here asking about giving blood.

22:45.328 --> 22:48.829
- Send them up to the blood bank.
- Okay.

22:49.996 --> 22:52.163
Mother was gonna let
her children burn to death.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.997
She was cooking methamphetamine...

22:54.164 --> 22:56.665
...5 feet away from where her kids
were sleeping.

22:57.415 --> 23:01.333
Okay, Raul. Your burns are constricting
and shrinking your chest...

23:01.500 --> 23:04.751
...so Peter's gonna relieve the pressure
so you can breathe.

23:05.168 --> 23:08.294
All right, let's get these dressings off.

23:10.462 --> 23:13.797
- God.
- Let's start with two lateral incisions.

23:14.296 --> 23:17.172
Cut longitudinally
down the midaxillary line.

23:17.339 --> 23:20.256
- BP's still 80/50.
- Give him a 500 cc bolus.

23:20.924 --> 23:22.758
Pulse is thready.

23:23.841 --> 23:26.301
- I don't know if I can do this.
- Come on, just focus.

23:32.637 --> 23:35.513
- No, really.
- Deepen incision till you hit fresh tissue.

23:35.679 --> 23:37.596
Come on, you can do it.

23:44.766 --> 23:46.683
- I'm sorry. I can't.
- I got it.

23:48.267 --> 23:51.809
Dr. Ross, the boy's back from Radiology,
and the police want to talk to him.

23:51.976 --> 23:54.102
Okay. Will you let me know
if anything changes?

23:55.353 --> 23:58.021
- Okay. That's it.
- Better?

24:01.438 --> 24:04.273
- Burn guys are here.
- Quite the crowd.

24:04.439 --> 24:07.024
Morning, Mark. What have we got?

24:08.274 --> 24:10.983
- Hey, kiddo, how's it going?
- His arm hurts.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.276
Yeah, well, you got first-degree burns.
Do you know what those are?

24:14.443 --> 24:16.986
- No.
- Like a bad sunburn.

24:17.152 --> 24:20.195
Hurts really bad, but no permanent
damage. How's his sputum?

24:20.361 --> 24:24.155
- Clear in the last hour.
- Max, do you like baseball?

24:24.905 --> 24:27.865
You'll be back at spring
training in no time.

24:29.032 --> 24:31.074
- Where's my mom?
- We don't know.

24:31.241 --> 24:35.200
Somebody saw her outside the fire,
and then she just disappeared.

24:35.367 --> 24:37.452
- Is Jessica okay?
- Jessica, your sister.

24:37.618 --> 24:40.952
She went to a different hospital,
but she's gonna be fine too.

24:41.119 --> 24:42.703
And Jamie?

24:42.870 --> 24:45.954
That's the baby?
He was with your mom.

24:46.121 --> 24:48.289
Do you have any idea
where we can find them?

24:50.372 --> 24:55.040
There's a police detective here.
He wants to talk to you. Okay?

24:57.208 --> 24:59.626
Let's get him up to the Burn Unit.

25:00.459 --> 25:01.710
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah.

25:01.876 --> 25:05.378
- He have a family?
- I called them already.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.462
- Who's gonna tell Raul?
- I will.

25:07.629 --> 25:10.797
No, I will. He's a fireman.
He already knows.

25:11.505 --> 25:13.089
Give us some room, guys.

25:18.841 --> 25:22.342
- Hang in there, Melendez.
- You're gonna be okay, bro.

25:23.427 --> 25:26.844
- We're all pulling for you, man.
- Hang tough, Raul.

25:27.845 --> 25:31.221
- You take care now.
- God bless.

25:46.268 --> 25:47.935
Excuse me.

25:49.352 --> 25:51.144
ER.

25:51.311 --> 25:54.229
Hang on. I'm on the phone.
No, you need Media Relations.

25:54.396 --> 25:56.729
Yeah, they'll fill you in. Right.

25:58.230 --> 26:00.606
- Can I help you?
- Is Dr. Lewis around?

26:00.773 --> 26:04.649
- No, she's busy right now.
- If you see her, tell her I'm in daycare.

26:04.816 --> 26:08.150
- I'm her sister, Chloe.
- Okay.

26:16.237 --> 26:18.404
- You doing all right?
- Is Raul okay?

26:18.571 --> 26:21.405
- He's in pain. Doesn't want the Vicodin.
- How's he doing?

26:21.572 --> 26:23.240
Repeat gas was normal.

26:23.406 --> 26:26.282
What the hell is going on?

26:26.449 --> 26:28.574
Jeanie, can you give us a minute?

26:40.496 --> 26:41.829
No.

26:44.205 --> 26:46.498
Oh, no!

26:47.040 --> 26:49.123
No! No!

27:07.255 --> 27:08.589
Dr. Benton?

27:09.505 --> 27:13.257
- What is it, Carter?
- I don't know what happened.

27:14.215 --> 27:16.633
I've seen a lot since I've been here,
but that...

27:16.800 --> 27:20.760
- You have to focus, Carter.
- I know. I tried.

27:22.010 --> 27:24.094
They announce the matches
in a couple weeks...

27:24.261 --> 27:26.637
...and I wanna be a surgeon, but that...

27:27.387 --> 27:29.888
I don't know if I can do that.

27:31.597 --> 27:33.306
You can.

27:35.849 --> 27:37.183
Carter.

27:41.934 --> 27:45.185
It doesn't get worse than that.

27:45.810 --> 27:47.936
You stayed on your feet.

27:48.103 --> 27:49.645
That says something.

27:59.149 --> 28:02.316
- Lily, get Dr. Ross.
- Jerry, what's open?

28:02.483 --> 28:03.817
Trauma 2.

28:04.025 --> 28:06.776
He was fine, but suddenly he started
having trouble breathing.

28:06.943 --> 28:08.277
Airway obstruction!

28:08.819 --> 28:10.486
Come in here.

28:10.653 --> 28:13.279
Pediatric intubation tray.

28:13.445 --> 28:15.346
Soot in his airway.

28:15.413 --> 28:18.230
CBC, Chem-20, PTT, PT.

28:18.273 --> 28:21.531
Get a blood gas with a
CO level, portable chest.

28:21.898 --> 28:26.200
- Stick him for a glucose.
- I fixed up those burns on his arms.

28:26.367 --> 28:29.159
- I thought he was okay.
- Epiglottal edema.

28:29.326 --> 28:32.244
- Can you get it?
- Pulse ox 65. Cyanotic nail beds.

28:32.411 --> 28:35.787
- Faint pulse at 32.
- I don't think I can get it.

28:35.954 --> 28:38.830
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?

28:39.330 --> 28:43.706
Airway obstruction from
laryngeal burns. Can't get the tube in.

28:43.873 --> 28:46.624
- I'm gonna have to needle crike him.
- Please don't let my baby die.

28:46.791 --> 28:48.458
Give me the scope.

28:49.291 --> 28:52.251
- Throat's swollen shut.
- Prep for a crike. I'll keep trying.

28:52.417 --> 28:55.794
-14-gauge angiocath.
- Please don't let him die!

28:58.128 --> 29:00.963
- Go on, Doug-
- Wait, I'm almost in!

29:02.588 --> 29:04.713
There, I got it. I got it! Bag him!

29:05.881 --> 29:09.715
- Good breath sounds.
- Thank you.

29:09.882 --> 29:13.801
Thank you so much. I'm so sorry.

29:17.718 --> 29:20.803
- Is that the mother from the fire?
- Yeah, I think so.

29:20.969 --> 29:24.179
Should have been her airway.
I would have let her suffocate.

29:31.140 --> 29:34.391
Thank you. I'm so sorry.

29:36.808 --> 29:38.643
Thank you.

29:41.810 --> 29:44.811
His BP's unstable.
Serum myoglobin is climbing.

29:44.978 --> 29:49.104
There's evidence of rhabdomyolysis
and impending renal failure.

29:49.271 --> 29:52.814
Respiratory function is deteriorating,
but he's conscious and alert.

29:54.482 --> 29:56.982
He won't make it to morning.

29:59.484 --> 30:02.485
- His family here yet?
- In the lobby.

30:02.651 --> 30:05.986
One brother's on vacation.
He's flying in from Florida tonight.

30:07.612 --> 30:09.612
Hope his flight's on time.

30:17.073 --> 30:19.741
- How's he doing?
- Okay. Sedated.

30:19.908 --> 30:22.450
Burns were mostly first-degree.
Did the cops come for the mother?

30:22.617 --> 30:26.744
She's in with the Homicide-Arson guys
now. The dad's flying in from Florida.

30:26.909 --> 30:30.619
- Get the kids. And you should get going.
- What?

30:30.786 --> 30:34.538
- Bulls game starts in an hour.
- I got to wait for Pedes to come.

30:34.705 --> 30:36.580
- I'll do it.
- It's okay.

30:36.747 --> 30:39.998
You should go, Doug. You've gotten
this far, you should see it through.

30:40.165 --> 30:41.832
I'm okay.

30:46.250 --> 30:47.917
Hey, Mark.

30:49.585 --> 30:53.545
Pedes were supposed to be here an hour
ago. Why don't you give them a call.

30:53.712 --> 30:56.421
Say hello to Benny the Bull for me.

31:04.549 --> 31:05.841
Hi.

31:07.758 --> 31:10.801
Your family is here.
They're waiting outside.

31:12.093 --> 31:14.802
Take my mask off, please.

31:16.011 --> 31:17.345
Please.

31:26.807 --> 31:31.600
- How bad?
- Over 90 percent third-degree.

31:35.142 --> 31:38.435
- Don't let them put me on a ventilator.
- It'll make you breathe easier.

31:38.602 --> 31:40.311
No.

31:43.479 --> 31:44.813
Okay.

31:49.690 --> 31:52.232
Put the mask back on.

31:55.150 --> 31:58.443
- Are those kids gonna make it?
- Yeah. Thanks to you.

31:58.609 --> 32:01.486
No. It was Shep.

32:03.028 --> 32:05.195
Balls of steel.

32:06.695 --> 32:08.822
They're gonna let him
come up and see me?

32:08.988 --> 32:12.365
I don't see how they'd be able
to keep him away.

32:17.116 --> 32:20.243
- Carol, I'm scared.
- I know.

32:23.035 --> 32:26.370
- I'm really scared.
- I know.

32:51.128 --> 32:53.755
Lydia, are you okay?

32:54.421 --> 32:55.755
Yeah.

32:57.214 --> 33:02.257
Damn it, I hate to cry.
No damn privacy around this place.

33:03.133 --> 33:06.343
- Yeah. I'm sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.

33:11.094 --> 33:15.054
It's just some days, I don't know what
to do with it all, you know?

33:58.361 --> 34:00.154
Jamie Nielsen's admitted to Pediatrics.

34:00.319 --> 34:02.863
Can you find his x-rays?
They weren't with the chart.

34:03.029 --> 34:05.989
- Raul's in the Burn Ward?
- His family's up there now.

34:06.156 --> 34:09.197
You guys wanna get something to eat?
I don't feel like going home.

34:09.364 --> 34:11.574
- I'm in.
- Yeah, sure.

34:12.658 --> 34:15.449
Jerry, why are they still here?

34:15.617 --> 34:20.034
Those are the off-duty guys from
Station 134, where Shep and Raul work.

34:20.202 --> 34:24.411
They've been here for hours. They
don't know what to do with themselves.

34:25.996 --> 34:27.329
Hey.

34:29.746 --> 34:32.415
- You guys still waiting?
- Yeah.

34:32.581 --> 34:35.416
- Anybody hungry?
- I don't know.

34:35.581 --> 34:39.792
We're gonna go across the street and
get something. Do you want to come?

34:42.127 --> 34:45.460
Dr. Lewis, did your sister find you?
She's been here for hours.

34:45.628 --> 34:47.587
She said she'd be up in daycare.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.295
- Oh, my God.
- What?

35:25.476 --> 35:28.101
- Did she take her? Where is she?
- What? No!

35:28.268 --> 35:30.019
- Where is she?
- There!

35:40.439 --> 35:43.607
Oh, my God. Susie.

35:45.399 --> 35:49.317
She is so beautiful.

35:57.862 --> 35:59.738
Susie.

36:07.407 --> 36:08.741
Shep?

36:12.451 --> 36:14.452
You ready to go see him?

36:15.619 --> 36:18.328
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

36:19.953 --> 36:21.954
We didn't have to go in.

36:23.538 --> 36:27.247
Engine companies were on their way.

36:27.414 --> 36:29.624
- We could hear them coming.
- It's not your fault.

36:29.790 --> 36:32.666
- He only went in because of me.
- You did what you should do.

36:32.833 --> 36:35.083
We didn't even have the right gear.

36:35.917 --> 36:40.586
He knew it. He looked at the fire, and
then he looked at me. And he knew it.

36:41.502 --> 36:43.462
He followed me in anyway.

36:47.464 --> 36:49.839
You have to go see him.

36:56.842 --> 36:59.759
Your friend is lying up there
waiting for you.

36:59.926 --> 37:04.261
And if you don't go, you're gonna
regret this for the rest of your life.

37:09.805 --> 37:12.723
The guy tells me, "I showed her
this morning before the bell. "

37:12.889 --> 37:16.181
And I said,
"But that was two hours ago. "

37:16.932 --> 37:20.016
- Here you go, you son of a bitch.
- Doug?

37:21.767 --> 37:24.143
Who the hell was that?

37:24.309 --> 37:25.685
My son.

37:25.852 --> 37:28.353
Karen, excuse me.

37:30.354 --> 37:32.271
Doug! Doug!

37:32.646 --> 37:36.106
Doug, wait a minute. Doug, listen to me.

37:36.273 --> 37:38.731
I called the hospital hours ago.
I left you a message!

37:38.898 --> 37:40.148
Right, right.

37:40.315 --> 37:42.567
- It was a meeting!
- A meeting. What was her name?

37:42.733 --> 37:44.526
Was it Barbara or Anne?

37:44.692 --> 37:48.151
Was it Dottie? Wasn't that the girl
I caught you with in Mom's car?

37:48.318 --> 37:51.653
- That was my boss.
- I thought you owned the joint.

37:51.820 --> 37:54.737
- It's complicated, Doug.
- Yeah, it's complicated.

37:54.904 --> 37:59.989
For God's sake! I would have been
there if I could have! You know that.

38:00.156 --> 38:04.616
Look, I left you a message.
I'm sorry. Son...

38:05.075 --> 38:07.826
Come on. Hey.

38:07.992 --> 38:12.828
I'll get tickets for next week's game.
We'll sit courtside, all right? Please.

38:14.578 --> 38:18.746
- I'm freezing my ass off. Let's go inside.
- It's always about you. What you want.

38:18.913 --> 38:21.664
- Never about anybody else. Just you.
- It was business.

38:21.830 --> 38:25.748
I was standing there, Ray. It was 7:30,
and you were supposed to be there.

38:25.915 --> 38:28.291
I was standing there. Where were you?

38:28.458 --> 38:32.542
You were exactly where you have always
been your entire life. Someplace else.

38:32.709 --> 38:34.710
That's where you were!

38:35.668 --> 38:37.252
Now, look.

38:39.670 --> 38:44.172
I cannot change what happened to you
when you were a kid. I can't.

38:46.589 --> 38:50.674
You did a good number on me, Ray.
You did a good job.

38:54.550 --> 38:58.177
I've never committed to anything
in my entire life.

38:59.302 --> 39:02.219
I've never been with a woman
for more than six months.

39:02.386 --> 39:05.013
Most of the time it's six days.

39:05.346 --> 39:09.806
Find a job where I see people for a
few minutes. I fix them as best I can.

39:09.972 --> 39:14.266
I send them on their way.
No mess, no fuss.

39:14.433 --> 39:20.018
No messy details. That's what you
taught me, right? That's your trick.

39:21.643 --> 39:23.644
Well, here I am...

39:24.686 --> 39:26.604
...Dad.

39:28.563 --> 39:30.605
I'm you.

39:38.191 --> 39:42.401
What happened to you as a child,
I'm responsible for.

39:43.443 --> 39:46.236
You're 34-years-old.

39:47.278 --> 39:50.487
How you live your life is your decision.

39:53.196 --> 39:55.614
I'm going inside.

40:13.287 --> 40:16.371
So the woman is buck-naked,
hanging over Shep's shoulder...

40:16.538 --> 40:19.956
...and Raul is running behind her
with the damn poodle.

40:20.123 --> 40:22.957
And the drunk husband's chasing them
with a butcher knife...

40:23.124 --> 40:25.083
...screaming how he'll kill all of them.

40:25.250 --> 40:28.293
"I'm gonna kill you, you bastards! "

40:32.377 --> 40:35.878
- Shep's afraid of heights.
- A fireman afraid of heights?

40:36.045 --> 40:38.421
Hey, it's true. He is.

40:38.587 --> 40:40.880
Raul is always making him
go up the fire escape...

40:41.047 --> 40:45.215
...or pull the jumpers off the tops
of buildings. Stuff like that.

40:45.382 --> 40:47.466
Raul gave Shep skydiving lessons
for Christmas.

40:50.259 --> 40:52.634
- He ever play "La Bamba" for you?
- Yeah.

40:52.801 --> 40:55.511
- I like "La Bamba. "
- You wouldn't if you worked with him.

40:55.678 --> 40:59.887
When I rode with him years back, he
had it on tape. Played it over and over.

41:00.054 --> 41:02.888
- Enough to make you kill yourself.
- Or him.

41:05.597 --> 41:08.556
You guys remember that little baby
they brought in a year ago?

41:08.723 --> 41:11.891
Found it in a garbage bag
down on the South Side.

41:12.058 --> 41:14.892
- I remember.
- Yeah.

41:15.059 --> 41:17.227
Been dead at least three or four hours...

41:17.394 --> 41:21.311
...but those boys brought her in
doing CPR and mouth-to-mouth.

41:21.478 --> 41:24.687
Child was cold,
but they wouldn't give up.

41:24.854 --> 41:28.231
Yelled at us
when we told them it was hopeless.

41:28.397 --> 41:32.899
Then they both cried.
Like it was their own kid.

41:33.399 --> 41:36.900
- Hell, I cried.
- Me too.

42:04.535 --> 42:06.536
Hey, partner.

42:06.703 --> 42:09.162
Hey, partner.

42:15.289 --> 42:18.248
Guess I missed that free breakfast.

42:21.583 --> 42:24.459
- Oh, man.
- Hey, hey.

42:29.502 --> 42:31.920
You got to hang in there, okay?

42:32.087 --> 42:35.130
- I can't do it, bro.
- You got to!

42:47.593 --> 42:50.469
I heard those kids are doing great.

42:53.219 --> 42:57.263
- You saved them, buddy.
- No, I didn't.

42:57.430 --> 42:59.346
You did.

43:12.810 --> 43:14.811
I'm sorry.

43:16.020 --> 43:18.019
I'm sorry, buddy.

43:19.645 --> 43:21.646
I'm sorry.

43:25.648 --> 43:27.648
I'm sorry.

43:28.941 --> 43:31.024
I'm sorry.

43:34.609 --> 43:36.694
I'm sorry.
