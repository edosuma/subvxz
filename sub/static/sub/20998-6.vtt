00:00.287 --> 00:01.687
<i>Previously on "Claws"...</i>

00:01.689 --> 00:04.223
How is your boyfriend, Desna?

00:04.225 --> 00:06.926
Unfortunately, he was murdered.

00:06.928 --> 00:10.363
Back where I come from,
when someone kills your family,

00:10.365 --> 00:12.732
you hunt them down.

00:12.734 --> 00:15.434
The owner of your dream
salon, Glint Nails,

00:15.436 --> 00:17.136
has put it back on the market,

00:17.138 --> 00:19.038
and she's willing to play ball with you.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.406
Shut up.

00:20.408 --> 00:23.876
The racist who didn't want
to deal with my kind

00:23.878 --> 00:26.646
has now changed her tune?

00:26.648 --> 00:27.446
How's it going?

00:27.448 --> 00:28.981
Detective Arlene Branch.

00:31.853 --> 00:35.655
The Coombses... They...
They had sex with me.

00:35.657 --> 00:38.591
We're pinning Roller's murder
on my foster parents.

00:42.130 --> 00:44.230
We did it.

00:44.232 --> 00:45.831
We just got a call.

00:45.833 --> 00:47.233
Take care of it.

00:47.235 --> 00:49.368
Aah!

00:53.041 --> 00:55.574
Mr. Emerson.

00:55.576 --> 00:57.209
You're alive.

01:00.081 --> 01:01.447
We did this.

01:01.449 --> 01:03.416
<i>We did not do this.</i>

01:03.418 --> 01:05.318
We set the Coombses up to be killed.

01:05.319 --> 01:07.653
No, we set them up to go to jail.

01:07.655 --> 01:11.057
This was done
by Uncle Daddy's corrupt popo.

01:11.059 --> 01:12.325
Pol, this was done by Bryce.

01:12.327 --> 01:14.560
Because Uncle Daddy forced him to do it.

01:14.562 --> 01:15.995
Listen, you guys,
we didn't know any of this

01:15.997 --> 01:17.396
was gonna happen, okay?

01:17.398 --> 01:18.798
But it did.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.366
Okay, and now Jenn
has to live with the fact

01:20.368 --> 01:23.502
that her husband is a murderer

01:23.504 --> 01:25.404
for the rest of their lives.

01:25.406 --> 01:28.774
<i>She thinks that he avenged
his brother's death.</i>

01:28.776 --> 01:30.743
But he wasn't, Pol.

01:30.745 --> 01:32.645
He killed my foster parents.

01:32.647 --> 01:34.547
Okay, but Jenn doesn't know that.

01:34.549 --> 01:37.249
- Right.
- And she better never find out,

01:37.251 --> 01:38.784
otherwise, I'll beat your little ass.

01:38.786 --> 01:41.787
Hey, listen, Desna, those
Coombses were terrible people.

01:41.789 --> 01:42.788
I know.

01:42.790 --> 01:44.457
Well, now Dean never has to worry

01:44.459 --> 01:47.593
about those malevolent shitwipes again.

01:47.595 --> 01:49.895
- Des?
- Hey, Deany.

01:49.897 --> 01:52.095
Hey, Des. I...

01:53.067 --> 01:55.515
Hi, Virginia. Hey, Dean.

01:56.270 --> 01:57.370
You look pretty.

01:57.372 --> 01:58.804
Thank you.

01:58.806 --> 02:00.039
II'm hungry.

02:00.041 --> 02:01.574
I'm right behind you, baby.

02:01.576 --> 02:04.608
I gotta go. It's a new day, Desna.

02:05.246 --> 02:07.013
New day for us, too. Tits up.

02:07.015 --> 02:08.547
You didn't have bad dreams last night.

02:08.549 --> 02:10.015
Usually, I hear screaming.

02:10.018 --> 02:14.286
For the first time since Roller
died, I actually slept.

02:16.891 --> 02:18.791
Yeah.

02:18.793 --> 02:21.093
Hey!

02:21.095 --> 02:23.129
Go, Dean.

02:23.131 --> 02:27.533
Go, Dean. Don't get bashful now.

02:30.571 --> 02:31.537
The Coombses are dead.

02:31.539 --> 02:33.706
What?

02:33.708 --> 02:35.541
It was on the news this morning.

02:35.543 --> 02:38.277
They were part of a drug ring, yeah.

02:38.279 --> 02:40.394
They got what they deserved.

02:41.315 --> 02:42.415
Yeah, they did.

02:42.417 --> 02:44.316
Are... you okay?

02:44.318 --> 02:47.586
I'm glad
those assholes are dead.

02:51.492 --> 02:53.159
Baby?

02:53.161 --> 02:56.495
What went down last night?

02:56.497 --> 02:57.663
I want to talk about it.

02:57.665 --> 02:59.165
You want to talk about it?

03:00.568 --> 03:01.901
You know, two years ago,

03:01.903 --> 03:04.103
that shit might have
put me on a... on a bender.

03:04.105 --> 03:08.291
Like the time I woke up
in Weeki Wachee with no pants

03:08.293 --> 03:09.954
and a pack of feral cats eating my hair.

03:09.979 --> 03:10.717
Yeah.

03:10.753 --> 03:13.446
But I've been workin'
the program and doing the steps.

03:13.448 --> 03:15.909
Truth be told, I'm proud of myself.

03:16.883 --> 03:18.884
I did what needed doing.

03:19.224 --> 03:21.353
And you've done all you
promised Uncle Daddy.

03:21.355 --> 03:23.289
And we can get our life back, right?

03:23.291 --> 03:24.957
Yes, ma'am.

03:26.427 --> 03:29.028
In light of this news, I feel
that you deserve a morning BJ.

03:31.866 --> 03:33.666
Race you to the car.

03:33.668 --> 03:35.401
You know I got on heels!

03:40.041 --> 03:43.742
When I saw you
in that swamp, Mr. Emerson,

03:43.744 --> 03:45.945
I knew you were special.

03:45.947 --> 03:50.015
It's like the fates intervened
and manifest my dreams.

03:50.017 --> 03:55.621
My very own English suitor
dropped from the sky.

03:55.623 --> 03:58.190
Look at you now.

03:58.192 --> 03:59.859
Lady, my chest hurts.

03:59.861 --> 04:02.528
You're like a gift from heaven,

04:02.530 --> 04:05.998
Mr. Emerson,
and I'm your guardian angel.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.235
We're going to be like
those couples in Italian movies.

04:09.237 --> 04:10.569
Let me go, please.

04:10.571 --> 04:12.438
We're going to have
little porcelain plates

04:12.440 --> 04:14.440
with tiny ham and cheese sandwiches

04:14.442 --> 04:18.310
that don't fill you up,
but make you feel rich.

04:18.312 --> 04:19.678
Let me use your phone, please.

04:19.680 --> 04:23.115
No, no, Mr. Emerson,
you don't need the phone.

04:23.117 --> 04:26.161
We're going to make you strong again...

04:26.163 --> 04:28.521
so we can walk
the hillsides together.

04:28.523 --> 04:30.189
No.

You know every single one of these

05:01.189 --> 05:03.756
tight little housewives
gets her poohole waxed.

05:03.758 --> 05:06.225
Ooh! It even smells expensive,

05:06.227 --> 05:08.494
like a mix of French perfume,

05:08.496 --> 05:11.096
new cars, and health care.

05:13.167 --> 05:17.703
This is it. Our dreams are
becoming a reality, ladies.

05:17.705 --> 05:20.272
Who been texting all day, Quiet Ann?

05:20.274 --> 05:24.710
I see that little
girly blush on your cheeks.

05:24.712 --> 05:27.546
You got a little
special someone, don't you?

05:27.548 --> 05:29.915
Ooh, well, right here,
we can come every morning

05:29.917 --> 05:32.718
- and have a little macchiato.
- Ooh.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.553
Bitch, you can't even spell macchiato.

05:48.836 --> 05:50.269
No, I think I like it right here.

05:50.271 --> 05:52.137
Ann found the bar.

05:52.139 --> 05:53.305
At the bar!

05:53.307 --> 05:54.974
Excuse me, do you mind
just stepping aside?

05:54.976 --> 05:58.043
I'm just trying to get a feel
for the feng shui.

05:58.045 --> 05:59.445
Thank y'all.

06:08.289 --> 06:10.856
It's amazing how clear racism is,

06:10.858 --> 06:12.758
even if it's spoken in another language.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.293
Ms. Simms, you're here.

06:14.295 --> 06:18.998
Despite your many efforts
to block me and my kind, I am.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.566
I was just trying to be cautious.

06:20.568 --> 06:21.967
I hope you met my girls.

06:21.969 --> 06:23.936
Sadly, I can't take them
to Tampa with me.

06:23.938 --> 06:27.239
I did, and I was thinking about
keeping some of them on,

06:27.241 --> 06:29.475
but after that warm welcome I received,

06:29.477 --> 06:33.912
I've decided to hire new techs
to supplement my crew.

06:33.914 --> 06:36.649
- Glint has five stars on Yelp.
- Whoa.

06:36.651 --> 06:39.285
My girls have won NailPalm twice.

06:39.287 --> 06:40.886
I knew you were all common.

06:40.888 --> 06:43.055
I didn't think you were
dimwitted, as well.

06:43.057 --> 06:46.759
You underestimate me.

06:46.761 --> 06:49.328
These are the baddest bitches
in Palmetto,

06:49.330 --> 06:50.729
and the last thing we need is

06:50.731 --> 06:53.065
some Korean Barbies dragging us down,

06:53.067 --> 06:56.135
so why don't all y'all be out by 6:00,

06:56.137 --> 06:59.569
and take these tacky fruit bowls
with you.

07:12.019 --> 07:13.786
The old tampon in the toilet trick.

07:13.788 --> 07:15.754
That's harsh.

07:15.756 --> 07:17.690
And we planned
on opening up this week, too.

07:17.692 --> 07:19.625
I just... I feel so bad.

07:19.627 --> 07:22.396
I wish I could help fix it,
but I'm broke.

07:22.398 --> 07:25.798
- Yes, you is.
- Unlike you, Miss Relevance.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.000
That's your third new bag this month.

07:28.002 --> 07:30.169
Don't tell me you trappin' again.

07:30.171 --> 07:31.070
I hit the lotto, girl.

07:31.072 --> 07:33.005
- Girl, here we go.
- Unhunh.

07:33.007 --> 07:36.742
I met a dude at the WinnDixie,
pays me $400 an hour

07:36.744 --> 07:38.644
just to dance around
in a Tweety Bird costume

07:38.646 --> 07:39.878
while he live streams it.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.213
What?! You lyin'.

07:41.215 --> 07:43.682
Girl, I'm not hookin'. I'm not stealing.

07:43.684 --> 07:48.220
I am using my Godgiven talents
to do honest work for perverts.

07:48.222 --> 07:52.191
Good for you, because that bag is cute.

07:52.193 --> 07:53.592
You want in?

07:53.594 --> 07:56.128
'Cause he's got friends
with some similar proclivities.

07:56.130 --> 07:58.797
And the house they shoot
at, girl, super nice.

07:58.799 --> 08:02.067
Silk sheets, a bougie fridge
full of all kind of food.

08:02.069 --> 08:03.635
Little chocolates and shit, girl.

08:03.637 --> 08:05.604
I'm not into that stuff anymore.

08:05.606 --> 08:07.206
I got a job now.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.340
I got a crew.

08:08.342 --> 08:10.242
Those old bitches that whupped your ass?

08:10.244 --> 08:12.878
Call me when
that shit blows up in your face.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.247
Ooh, excuse me?

08:15.249 --> 08:17.075
But how your nails looking, though?

08:17.077 --> 08:18.562
Bitch! They look good. Poppin', right?

08:18.564 --> 08:20.529
- Okay.
- You did that. Thank you.

08:25.626 --> 08:26.925
How bad is it?

08:26.927 --> 08:29.795
Well, your pipes burst.

08:29.797 --> 08:32.563
Water penetrated
in the structural cavities.

08:32.566 --> 08:33.966
You're gonna need epoxy.

08:33.967 --> 08:36.668
We know, baby, that you
used to be a contractor.

08:36.669 --> 08:38.003
Can you give it to us in English?

08:38.005 --> 08:39.905
Your floors are shot to shit.

08:39.907 --> 08:41.106
Rugs all need to be replaced.

08:41.107 --> 08:42.875
You got damage to the bathroom wall.

08:42.876 --> 08:44.243
How much we talking, Bryce?

08:45.479 --> 08:46.912
Damn!

08:46.914 --> 08:48.680
Where am I supposed to get
that kind of money?

08:48.682 --> 08:50.549
Well, go to the bank, get a loan.

08:50.551 --> 08:52.718
PollyPol, you see life

08:52.720 --> 08:54.386
through Caucasiancolored glasses.

08:54.388 --> 08:57.022
Maybe you could borrow
the money from Uncle Daddy.

08:58.092 --> 09:00.192
Hell to the no, are you crazy?

09:00.194 --> 09:02.294
After all we just did to pay him back.

09:02.296 --> 09:03.962
And we are done with Uncle Daddy.

09:03.964 --> 09:08.365
Well, actually, he wants
to see us right now.

09:08.969 --> 09:10.367
Good.

09:10.838 --> 09:12.204
This'll give you a chance to tell him

09:12.206 --> 09:14.206
you're done in person.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.574
Yeah.

09:15.576 --> 09:17.376
Right.

09:22.783 --> 09:25.284
Pol, that money
we planted on the Coombses

09:25.286 --> 09:28.253
was all the money I had.

09:28.255 --> 09:30.756
Am I ever gonna catch a break?

09:30.758 --> 09:33.158
Things are gonna turn around.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.294
They have to.

09:35.296 --> 09:39.061
Damn.

09:44.592 --> 09:46.559
I don't get it. Whose house is this?

09:46.561 --> 09:49.094
Bryce, let me tell you something.

09:49.096 --> 09:51.630
Knowing those Coombses are playing bingo

09:51.632 --> 09:53.198
in hell with Hitler, Idi Amin,

09:53.200 --> 09:56.835
and my firstgrade teacher,
Sister Grace Margaret,

09:56.837 --> 09:59.708
truly appeases my soul.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.007
Tell him you're done.

10:02.009 --> 10:03.142
Tell him.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.044
Bryce, you have proven yourself.

10:05.046 --> 10:09.048
Not only as a Husser,
but as a businessman.

10:09.050 --> 10:12.351
Last week was the best
the clinic's ever had.

10:12.353 --> 10:14.553
Wait, really?

10:14.555 --> 10:16.725
That's why I got you this house.

10:18.292 --> 10:19.625
What?

10:19.627 --> 10:21.961
Local schools, they got smaller classes,

10:21.963 --> 10:24.697
and they got...
they got a music program.

10:24.699 --> 10:26.832
They got a... they got an edible garden

10:26.834 --> 10:29.946
which is like a...
like a farmtotable shit.

10:30.765 --> 10:33.742
This, Bryce... This is a thank you

10:34.709 --> 10:38.711
and perhaps in a... an in... incen...

10:38.713 --> 10:41.413
God damn, that Tshirt's distracting me.

10:41.415 --> 10:47.152
Perhaps an incentive to keep
on at the clinic.

10:47.154 --> 10:48.988
No strings attached.

10:55.296 --> 10:58.063
You know, Uncle Daddy,
this... this is generous.

10:58.065 --> 11:01.066
It's beyond generous, but I don't...

11:01.068 --> 11:03.702
- I don't think we can...
- Wait.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.270
It's got a music program?

11:05.272 --> 11:07.206
Yes, there is.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.819
Baylor has been wanting
to learn the clarinet.

11:10.411 --> 11:11.677
Son?

11:11.679 --> 11:13.178
You done good.

11:13.180 --> 11:16.493
You stepped up and made things
right for Roller.

11:17.518 --> 11:19.585
Lord rest his soul.

11:21.989 --> 11:23.789
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

11:23.791 --> 11:24.890
This is what we're like.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.825
Mr. Emerson, remember?

11:26.827 --> 11:30.496
When you... you...
you swooped me up in your arms,

11:30.498 --> 11:32.842
and you carried me to safety.

11:33.834 --> 11:37.069
I still remember that little café.

11:38.572 --> 11:41.807
In the rain, darling, on the viala.

11:53.254 --> 11:56.088
Will you stop playing around and help?

11:56.090 --> 11:57.890
All right, Miss Attitude. Geez.

11:57.892 --> 12:00.059
I have an attitude
because you not helping.

12:00.061 --> 12:01.412
But now I am.

12:02.363 --> 12:05.431
Ooh, girl, look, there go
those heifers from Glint.

12:06.801 --> 12:09.501
Go over there and tell me
what they saying.

12:09.503 --> 12:13.372
For the last time,
they're Korean, I'm Vietnamese.

12:13.374 --> 12:15.274
We are not the same, okay?

12:15.276 --> 12:16.108
Desna.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.576
Desna's stripper sidekick.

12:17.578 --> 12:18.510
Careful.

12:18.512 --> 12:19.945
What a coincidence.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.313
I'm so sorry to hear about

12:21.315 --> 12:23.215
that unfortunate
plumbing incident at Glint.

12:23.217 --> 12:25.050
We know you were behind it.

12:25.052 --> 12:27.820
Paranoia is not
a flattering shade on you.

12:27.822 --> 12:30.222
Look, we're just here to pick
up our supplies for NailPalm.

12:30.224 --> 12:32.191
Okay, well, maybe we'll join, too,

12:32.193 --> 12:33.726
show all you hoes how it's really done.

12:33.728 --> 12:36.328
Whatever.
That prize money is still ours.

12:41.435 --> 12:42.501
NailPalm?

12:42.503 --> 12:44.036
Hell, no.

12:44.038 --> 12:45.537
The Koreans always win that.

12:45.539 --> 12:46.939
Well, they won't this time.

12:46.941 --> 12:48.841
We gonna show those racist bitches

12:48.843 --> 12:51.143
that black people,
brown people, white people,

12:51.145 --> 12:53.078
whatever the hell Virginia is

12:53.080 --> 12:55.013
can kill it in the nail game.

12:55.015 --> 12:57.950
We are gonna show our talent
and win that prize money.

12:57.952 --> 12:59.785
And it's not right how their kind run

12:59.787 --> 13:01.353
the entire beauty industry.

13:01.355 --> 13:03.789
You know, y'all are pretty prejudiced.

13:03.791 --> 13:06.125
Stereotyping is human nature.

13:06.127 --> 13:09.361
It's how we understand
to speak in high tones to a baby

13:09.363 --> 13:11.296
and loudly to a senior.

13:11.298 --> 13:12.598
I heard that on NPR.

13:14.735 --> 13:15.901
What she say?

13:15.903 --> 13:18.270
I don't know.

13:18.272 --> 13:21.039
But I got respect
for the Koreans, right?

13:21.041 --> 13:22.608
My mentor was one.

13:22.610 --> 13:24.576
But that Glint bitch? Mnhmnh.

13:24.578 --> 13:27.780
She tried to redline me
from getting my salon.

13:27.782 --> 13:29.815
That right there deserves
a little side eye.

13:31.585 --> 13:32.785
Hey, girl.

13:32.787 --> 13:33.819
Hey, girl.

13:33.821 --> 13:35.220
- Polly.
- Yeah.

13:35.222 --> 13:37.756
I got an ingrown
on my bikini line needs tending,

13:37.758 --> 13:39.358
and I can't get at it. Ouchie!

13:39.360 --> 13:42.472
Okay, well, come on back,
Scarlet, I got you.

13:43.330 --> 13:45.967
So, I got some news.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.646
Uncle Daddy got me
and Bryce a new house.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.437
A big new house.

13:52.439 --> 13:54.206
But it's in a better school district.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.741
It's, like, near a playground.

13:55.743 --> 13:57.476
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. How big?

14:00.047 --> 14:02.214
Are you kidding me?

14:02.216 --> 14:04.349
You know I been promising Dean a house.

14:04.351 --> 14:05.951
- I know.
- And... And your husband,

14:05.953 --> 14:08.053
what, worked at that clinic
for all of what, a week?

14:08.055 --> 14:10.122
Bryce earned that house.

14:10.124 --> 14:12.357
You know what he had
to do to get it, so...

14:12.359 --> 14:14.359
But he's not gonna do stuff
like that ever again.

14:14.361 --> 14:15.961
He's just gonna work at the clinic.

14:15.963 --> 14:17.629
Is this a joke?

14:17.631 --> 14:21.133
Look, I want you to let me pay
for the repairs at Glint.

14:21.135 --> 14:22.835
You know, you could "F"
this NailPalm shit.

14:22.837 --> 14:25.070
Des, just take the money.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.372
I want the money, Jenn.

14:27.374 --> 14:29.641
I need the money.

14:29.643 --> 14:32.244
I deserve the money?

14:32.246 --> 14:34.613
But I don't want shit
from the Dixie Mafia.

14:34.615 --> 14:38.116
And if you had any sense,
you wouldn't, either.

14:38.118 --> 14:41.053
I need some air.

14:45.392 --> 14:49.294
Can I get a sixpiece shrimp
with, um, extra sauce?

14:49.296 --> 14:50.329
Gotcha.

14:50.331 --> 14:52.898
Shit, Chaz, I don't have my purse.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.299
Can I pay you in a few?

14:54.301 --> 14:56.568
- No way, Desna, I can't do it.
- Are you serious?

14:56.570 --> 15:01.259
I eat here every day and I work
across the parking lot.

15:01.709 --> 15:05.430
I just need one freakin' thing
to go right today.

15:06.180 --> 15:09.314
Chaz, it's on me.

15:09.316 --> 15:10.749
Thank you.

15:10.751 --> 15:12.517
You're welcome.

15:12.519 --> 15:13.986
I'm Gregory Ruval.

15:13.988 --> 15:17.356
Yes, you are.

15:17.358 --> 15:18.123
I'm Desna.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.325
- Desna Simms.
- Desna.

15:21.729 --> 15:23.409
Would you like to join me
for lunch, maybe?

15:25.833 --> 15:28.333
I would, thank you.

15:38.295 --> 15:40.342
And he's a doctor?

15:40.344 --> 15:42.111
Not just a doctor.

15:42.113 --> 15:43.846
- He's a gynecologist.
- Ooh!

15:43.848 --> 15:44.780
What?!

15:44.782 --> 15:48.183
- Yes!
- Yes.

15:48.185 --> 15:50.052
My arm hairs all just stood on end.

15:50.054 --> 15:52.688
It is finally a reason
to get a pap smear.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.890
Hold on, y'all. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

15:54.892 --> 15:58.060
He even drives a Mercedes E Class.

15:58.062 --> 15:59.862
Ladies, you know what that means.

15:59.864 --> 16:02.631
Big car, big dick.

16:02.633 --> 16:05.434
She's in front of the customers.

16:05.436 --> 16:07.636
Y'all are so nasty.

16:07.638 --> 16:09.405
Ann, stop it.

16:09.407 --> 16:12.441
The man said he wants
to take me on a real date.

16:12.443 --> 16:14.576
Polly, give her a full Brazilian.

16:14.578 --> 16:15.811
What?!

16:15.813 --> 16:17.179
All of it, off!

16:17.181 --> 16:19.648
Listen, there's gonna be
a lot of romance tonight,

16:19.650 --> 16:20.783
but a classy guy like that?

16:20.785 --> 16:22.217
No nookie till the second date.

16:22.219 --> 16:24.820
A full bush will protect you
from succumbing,

16:24.822 --> 16:27.956
like that thorn bush outside
of Sleeping Beauty's castle.

16:29.427 --> 16:34.196
Okay, all of y'all are up
in my personal business, okay?

16:34.198 --> 16:35.631
What we need to be figuring out...

16:35.633 --> 16:37.099
what we gonna do at NailPalm.

16:37.101 --> 16:38.834
Yeah. I forgot to tell you.
I looked it up.

16:38.836 --> 16:42.271
It turns out, only four people
per team can be on the roster.

16:42.273 --> 16:45.107
One of us has to be
an alternate which means...

16:45.109 --> 16:47.943
Quiet Ann, sorry, girl.

16:47.945 --> 16:50.079
China Doll, you're the alternate.

16:50.081 --> 16:52.281
Wait, wait, wait, what?
You said I'm getting better.

16:52.283 --> 16:53.882
- You are, but...
- But what?

16:53.884 --> 16:55.517
Quiet Ann doesn't even do manicures.

16:55.519 --> 16:57.052
She doesn't even have a station.

16:57.054 --> 16:59.388
Her holo chromes and her
miniatures are on point.

16:59.390 --> 17:02.191
It's not that she don't know how
to do nails, it's just that...

17:02.193 --> 17:03.358
Sadly, I'm a leg man.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.359
- That part.
- That's bullshit.

17:06.763 --> 17:07.863
Screw y'all.

17:07.865 --> 17:09.964
I'm out.

17:09.967 --> 17:12.867
Did she just roll outta here like that?

17:12.869 --> 17:14.435
Real slow, just like...

17:14.438 --> 17:15.771
Go on.

17:24.415 --> 17:27.883
Mr. Emerson, you were right.

17:27.885 --> 17:29.384
Taking you off the morphine

17:29.386 --> 17:32.588
has made you a much more focused lover.

17:32.590 --> 17:35.591
Are you ready for another go?

17:35.593 --> 17:37.392
I need a minute.

17:37.394 --> 17:38.527
But baby girl, I...

17:38.529 --> 17:41.964
Miss Honeychild,

17:41.966 --> 17:44.199
I...

17:44.201 --> 17:50.139
I have other ways to make you smile.

17:51.442 --> 17:53.408
Lovely.

17:58.949 --> 18:00.082
Don't stop.

18:00.084 --> 18:02.217
It's just my gallerist.

18:04.121 --> 18:05.320
Larry?

18:05.322 --> 18:07.623
Yes, it's very sweet of you

18:07.625 --> 18:09.925
to think of me for Art South Beach...

18:09.927 --> 18:12.561
God.

18:12.563 --> 18:17.299
No, I know you're only asking me
because that pussy Jeff Koons

18:17.301 --> 18:19.468
is probably at a DAPL protest.

18:19.470 --> 18:21.336
Kisses to Alice!

18:21.338 --> 18:22.571
An art show?

18:22.573 --> 18:24.673
I never knew you were an artist baby...

18:24.675 --> 18:25.974
Miss Honeychurch.

18:25.976 --> 18:27.376
We'll discuss this later.

18:27.378 --> 18:30.813
Mr. Beebe and the others
will be here any moment.

18:30.815 --> 18:32.881
Quick. Quick.

18:37.655 --> 18:40.489
Relevance. Hey.

18:40.491 --> 18:42.324
What's up, girl? I changed my mind.

18:42.326 --> 18:44.026
Call that webcam guy, because I'm in.

18:44.028 --> 18:45.093
For real?

18:45.095 --> 18:46.228
Yeah, let's do this.

18:46.230 --> 18:49.064
Let's make this money, girl.

18:49.066 --> 18:52.701
So, did you always know
you wanted to be a doctor?

18:52.703 --> 18:56.972
No, actually, I wanted to be
a professional break dancer.

18:56.974 --> 18:58.492
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

19:00.010 --> 19:01.310
Get it, get it.

19:01.312 --> 19:04.012
That's cute.

19:04.014 --> 19:05.336
Yep.

19:05.749 --> 19:07.749
But no.

19:07.751 --> 19:12.821
The truth is, I watched a lot
of my people die in Haiti,

19:12.823 --> 19:14.089
preventable deaths.

19:14.091 --> 19:18.516
So I guess I just wanted
to right the wrongs.

19:19.063 --> 19:20.495
How about you?

19:20.497 --> 19:23.465
Owning a nail salon,
was it always your dream?

19:23.467 --> 19:26.168
I never thought I'd own anything.

19:26.170 --> 19:29.805
A Korean girl in the foster home
I was living in

19:29.807 --> 19:31.139
taught me how to do nails,

19:31.141 --> 19:34.610
and I perfected my skill at a strip club

19:34.612 --> 19:36.044
in my neighborhood.

19:37.648 --> 19:38.881
Do not judge me.

19:38.883 --> 19:40.182
Not as a dancer.

19:40.184 --> 19:42.818
I did nails for the strippers.

19:42.820 --> 19:44.253
- Got it?
- Okay.

19:44.255 --> 19:46.321
Yeah.

19:46.323 --> 19:49.391
And then a nail place
opened up in my neighborhood,

19:49.393 --> 19:50.659
and me and my best friend, Jenn,

19:50.661 --> 19:52.861
would go there every single day

19:52.863 --> 19:55.764
until we convinced the owner
to hire both of us.

19:55.766 --> 19:57.532
Wow, that's a great story.

19:57.534 --> 20:01.403
I respect a lady who goes
after what she really wants.

20:01.405 --> 20:03.272
I go after what I want.

20:07.311 --> 20:10.913
You know, I never met anyone
quite like you before.

20:17.121 --> 20:18.754
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

20:18.756 --> 20:21.723
This could be my brother,
and he has special needs.

20:21.725 --> 20:22.958
Can you give me one second?

20:22.960 --> 20:24.693
Of course.

20:24.695 --> 20:25.994
Hello?

20:25.996 --> 20:28.096
There's been an unmarked
police car outside the clinic

20:28.098 --> 20:29.364
for well over an hour.

20:29.366 --> 20:31.300
Kenneth, you gettin' on my nerves.

20:31.302 --> 20:32.801
Call Bryce.

20:32.803 --> 20:34.269
I did. He didn't answer.

20:34.271 --> 20:35.537
Look, if you don't come down soon,

20:35.539 --> 20:36.972
I'm gonna start flushing pills.

20:36.974 --> 20:38.607
And I know that's selfdefeating

20:38.609 --> 20:40.242
and it's not necessary,
but you know I'm gonna do it.

20:40.244 --> 20:43.142
I'm gonna do it because
I have no other ideas.

20:46.483 --> 20:50.886
Umm, a fire alarm
is going off at my salon.

20:50.888 --> 20:53.388
It's probably just
a short circuit, but...

20:53.390 --> 20:54.456
So you need to go?

20:54.458 --> 20:55.691
Yeah. I'll drive you.

20:55.693 --> 20:57.359
No, no, no.

20:57.361 --> 21:00.762
It's out of the way,
and I could just catch a cab.

21:00.764 --> 21:02.531
But thank you.

21:02.533 --> 21:04.266
I had a wonderful time.

21:04.268 --> 21:06.635
Maybe we could do it again.

21:06.637 --> 21:08.303
Gotta go.

21:15.713 --> 21:17.746
Come on, hurry.

21:17.748 --> 21:20.015
Come here, come here, come here.

21:20.017 --> 21:23.251
Ken, I left a date with
a hot gynecologist for this.

21:23.253 --> 21:25.220
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

21:25.222 --> 21:26.188
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:26.190 --> 21:27.856
See? What's it doing here?

21:27.858 --> 21:29.858
We're being staked out.

21:33.230 --> 21:34.777
What are you doing?

21:35.265 --> 21:37.029
Where are you going?

21:38.135 --> 21:40.074
Are you gonna say something?

21:41.305 --> 21:43.605
Des! What?

21:43.607 --> 21:45.507
Shit.

21:45.509 --> 21:48.844
Detective Arlene Branch.
Nice to meet you.

21:54.084 --> 21:55.550
Stop looking, Kenneth!

22:06.326 --> 22:08.192
- A cop?
- No bacon.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.928
Hon, you know better.

22:09.930 --> 22:11.329
End this shit, Ann.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.598
Go back to dating
lesscomplicated women,

22:13.600 --> 22:16.902
like your desperate housewives
with jealous husbands.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.405
Ann.

22:19.873 --> 22:21.657
Thank you.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.442
Why were you even there?

22:24.444 --> 22:25.977
Weren't you supposed to be on a date?

22:25.979 --> 22:30.148
What happened was, Ken called me
having a damn meltdown,

22:30.150 --> 22:31.649
and I had to go to the clinic.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.017
Really?

22:33.019 --> 22:34.052
What?

22:34.054 --> 22:35.787
Why y'all looking at me?

22:35.789 --> 22:36.955
Girl.

22:36.957 --> 22:38.890
I know an act of selfsabotage
when I see one.

22:38.892 --> 22:42.649
You are talking to the queen
of masturbatory punishment.

22:42.651 --> 22:43.761
Queens.

22:43.763 --> 22:46.431
Our parents didn't instill us
with a good sense of selfworth.

22:46.433 --> 22:49.434
- That's true.
- Knock it off, all of you, okay?

22:49.436 --> 22:51.703
I'm not selfsabotaging.

22:51.705 --> 22:55.306
Okay then, go call that mashup

22:55.308 --> 22:59.010
of Common and George Clooney
and apologize.

22:59.012 --> 23:00.878
Offer to make him dinner tonight.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.647
Okay, no.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.015
NailPalm is tomorrow.

23:04.017 --> 23:04.983
I need to rest.

23:04.985 --> 23:06.584
You gotta get a release.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.119
Forget my nosex policy.

23:08.121 --> 23:13.391
A big O tonight will assure
you a big V mañana.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.866
What? Come on.

23:23.503 --> 23:26.004
I can't stand y'all.
Come on, you can do it.

23:26.006 --> 23:27.138
Okay, fine, I'll call him.

23:29.876 --> 23:30.708
Hey.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.310
She's on the phone.

23:32.312 --> 23:33.811
I brought these as an apology,

23:33.813 --> 23:37.548
especially since she recently
saved my life, you know,

23:37.550 --> 23:40.284
but seriously? A cop?

23:40.286 --> 23:41.853
She rocks my world.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.457
You a little stressed?

23:46.459 --> 23:48.893
I mean, you were nearly
murdered by a coworker.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.261
That would take its toll on anybody.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.497
I keep reliving it.

23:52.499 --> 23:53.965
You should see my pulse.

23:53.967 --> 23:54.832
I don't sleep.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.968
I haven't shit in four days.

23:56.970 --> 23:57.735
It's out of control.

23:57.737 --> 23:58.970
Everything is out of control,

23:58.972 --> 24:00.705
and I don't know what I'm gonna...

24:04.144 --> 24:07.429
Apologies, but that
had to be done, honey.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.082
What?

24:11.084 --> 24:13.718
What?

24:13.720 --> 24:16.020
All right, y'all. It's done.

24:16.022 --> 24:19.157
Dr. Gregory Ruval will be
at my house tonight

24:19.159 --> 24:20.825
for a homecooked meal.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.393
What are you gonna cook, though?

24:22.395 --> 24:24.662
I don't think Dr. Ruval
is gonna want a Lean Cuisine.

24:24.664 --> 24:29.534
Ann is gonna hook me up
with her famous empanadas.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.402
You ain't gonna have
nothin' else to do tonight

24:31.404 --> 24:34.472
since you not dating the little cop.

24:34.474 --> 24:38.443
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

24:57.831 --> 24:59.063
Girls!

24:59.065 --> 25:00.698
Go on and get changed.

25:06.239 --> 25:07.772
Hey, hey, Jennifer?

25:07.774 --> 25:09.700
How'd... How'd you get this house?

25:10.110 --> 25:11.660
What you mean?

25:12.278 --> 25:14.112
Like, 'cause you do nails
like... like my sister,

25:14.114 --> 25:15.613
and then Desi said that Bryce is not

25:15.615 --> 25:18.049
a particularly successful life coach.

25:19.486 --> 25:21.953
And I know a new house
like this costs a lot of money,

25:21.955 --> 25:24.388
so one of you must have a new job

25:24.390 --> 25:26.791
that's greatly improved your salary.

25:26.793 --> 25:30.394
I do have a new job...
running the clinic.

25:31.931 --> 25:36.033
And weirdly, I'm better at it
than I am at coaching

25:36.035 --> 25:37.435
or contracting.

25:37.437 --> 25:40.271
And I guess if Uncle Daddy
ever needs some help sometime,

25:40.273 --> 25:41.506
I mean, I might help him.

25:41.508 --> 25:42.988
I mean, look at this house, you know.

25:43.443 --> 25:44.475
Hey!!

25:44.477 --> 25:45.576
Are you okay? Are you okay?

25:45.578 --> 25:46.844
- Let me see that.
- I'm fine.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.813
I'm just gonna... I'ma get some ice.

25:48.815 --> 25:50.248
- I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

25:50.250 --> 25:52.683
She's fine, she's fine.

25:52.685 --> 25:55.086
I got a new job, too,
yeah, body building.

25:55.088 --> 25:57.588
I got invited to a show in South Beach.

25:57.590 --> 25:58.723
Sounds impressive.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.876
Yeah, that's impressive.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.060
ShShould I invite Virginia?

26:06.633 --> 26:10.902
You know, Dean, abundance in life

26:10.904 --> 26:15.072
can only come through abundance in love.

26:18.311 --> 26:21.112
YeYeah, but should I...
should I invite Virginia?

26:22.649 --> 26:24.682
Those flowers really brighten things up.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.818
It's still a dump.

26:26.820 --> 26:28.619
What?

26:28.621 --> 26:29.620
I'm freakin' out.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.422
What is going on?

26:31.424 --> 26:33.124
The place is a wreck.

26:33.126 --> 26:36.994
I wanted to look
sophisticated for my date.

26:36.996 --> 26:39.697
Instead I think I look like
I'm going to an African prom.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.666
No. I just can't.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.768
You look amazing.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.870
Girl, what is really going on?

26:45.872 --> 26:49.707
This man is handsome and welldressed.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.108
He got an M.D. in cootchie.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.644
I mean, what does he want
to date me for?

26:53.646 --> 26:57.048
You're a gorgeous,
talented badass, that's why.

26:57.050 --> 27:00.184
- Ooh.
- You should wear this.

27:00.186 --> 27:03.654
It reminds me of what
Jen Aniston wore to her 40th.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.323
Gosh, she was luminous.

27:05.325 --> 27:06.424
Put it back.

27:06.426 --> 27:09.193
Put it back.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.361
Food's up.

27:10.363 --> 27:11.495
It smells so good.

27:11.497 --> 27:12.997
Come here.

27:12.999 --> 27:17.101
I am so lucky to have y'all.

27:17.103 --> 27:20.338
I love y'all, and thank you for tonight.

27:20.340 --> 27:24.842
Rest up, 'cause tomorrow,
we gots to kill it.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.982
<i>Hey, Jenn.
Is everything okay with Dean?</i>

27:30.984 --> 27:32.984
Yeah, yeah, he's playing
Monopoly with the girls.

27:32.986 --> 27:37.655
Um, I got some bad news.
I banged up my thumb real bad.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.257
I just got back from Urgent Care,

27:39.259 --> 27:41.092
<i>and there's no way I'm gonna
be able to compete tomorrow.</i>

27:41.094 --> 27:44.328
Shit! So Virginia's on the team now?

27:44.330 --> 27:46.430
Her acrylics are raggedy.

27:46.432 --> 27:47.598
I'm so sorry, babe.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.000
Maybe the judges will be blind.

27:49.002 --> 27:51.636
You know how important NailPalm is.

27:51.638 --> 27:54.972
Why were you using a hammer, anyway?

27:54.974 --> 27:56.674
What were you doing, putting up

27:56.676 --> 27:59.010
a Goddamn Mona Lisa in your new mansion?

27:59.012 --> 28:00.478
Don't you have servants for that?

28:00.480 --> 28:02.079
That's not fair.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.548
<i>Don't even get me started
on what fair is, Jenn,</i>

28:04.550 --> 28:06.817
if you...

28:06.819 --> 28:08.586
I gotta go.

28:18.564 --> 28:20.015
Hi.

28:20.633 --> 28:22.166
I'm Gregory.

28:22.168 --> 28:25.369
Gregory, this is Quiet Ann and Polly,

28:25.371 --> 28:26.904
and they were just leaving.

28:26.906 --> 28:30.408
Wow, you are as scrumptious
as a Georgia peach pie.

28:30.410 --> 28:32.243
Okay.

28:32.245 --> 28:35.379
Eat him up! Lick the filling!

28:40.620 --> 28:41.953
My friends are crazy.

28:41.955 --> 28:47.224
Listen, thank you for
giving me a second chance.

28:47.226 --> 28:52.130
Well, it takes more than one
fire alarm to scare me away.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.258
How about that?

28:54.667 --> 28:56.218
You hungry?

28:57.103 --> 28:58.235
Yes.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.338
So nice to have dinner with a gentleman.

29:00.340 --> 29:04.375
The secret to a sexy look
is threepoint lighting

29:04.377 --> 29:05.576
with some bounce.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.044
Right, okay.

29:07.046 --> 29:08.679
This your first time?

29:08.681 --> 29:10.982
No, I used to do
phone sex back in the day.

29:10.984 --> 29:12.316
I'm totally cool.

29:13.987 --> 29:16.754
Well, as soon as I posted your picture,

29:16.756 --> 29:19.491
I got 500 new subscribers.

29:20.159 --> 29:21.325
Wow.

29:21.327 --> 29:24.462
Yeah, I find that Asians
make the best rabbits.

29:24.464 --> 29:26.330
Okay. Um...

29:26.332 --> 29:30.134
All right, so what kind
of moves were you thinking?

29:30.136 --> 29:33.237
Some bunny hops, a tail wiggle, um...

29:33.239 --> 29:35.940
little noises?

29:35.942 --> 29:38.260
What are you...

29:38.911 --> 29:42.913
So, usually the order is cowgirl,

29:42.915 --> 29:44.448
then missionary,

29:44.450 --> 29:48.437
and then we end with doggie,
which we refer to as bunny.

29:48.621 --> 29:50.921
Okay, my friend, Relevance,

29:50.923 --> 29:53.124
said it was just gonna be me dancing.

29:53.126 --> 29:55.860
Well, your friend dropped the details.

29:55.862 --> 29:59.663
Okay, well, no problem,
just a misunderstanding.

29:59.665 --> 30:01.565
Where you going?

30:01.567 --> 30:02.767
I'm leaving.

30:02.769 --> 30:04.301
Bitch, I already paid you.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.270
Okay, here, look, take the money back.

30:06.272 --> 30:09.306
No, I've got 500 horny guys online

30:09.308 --> 30:10.908
paying big bucks to watch this.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.143
No, I don't think so, you stay.

30:12.145 --> 30:13.677
Okay, look, that's not my problem.

30:13.679 --> 30:14.645
It is your problem!

30:14.647 --> 30:17.281
Get off of me!

30:22.922 --> 30:25.557
Let me be straightforward with you.

30:26.292 --> 30:29.936
I've been doing the online thing...

30:30.562 --> 30:34.198
the hookups, the flakes, everything.

30:34.200 --> 30:38.903
What I'm looking for
is consistency, companionship,

30:38.905 --> 30:40.447
something real.

30:42.041 --> 30:47.812
Umm, let me say hustlers, check.

30:47.814 --> 30:50.448
Losers, check.

30:50.450 --> 30:54.819
I'm, um...

30:54.821 --> 30:57.388
Something real would be nice.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.342
Go ahead, get it.

31:18.344 --> 31:19.376
You sure?

31:19.378 --> 31:21.212
No, please.

31:21.214 --> 31:23.214
Okay. I'll make it quick.

31:25.051 --> 31:27.318
Fast, fast, fast. One second.

31:28.588 --> 31:30.788
This better be an emergency.

31:30.790 --> 31:32.289
You have to help me.

31:32.291 --> 31:34.558
I was supposed to dance like
a bunny on this webcam thing,

31:34.560 --> 31:37.428
but now the guy wants
to have sex with me.

31:37.430 --> 31:38.629
Girl, bye.

31:38.631 --> 31:40.664
Please, listen, I'm serious.

31:40.666 --> 31:41.932
He tried to put his hands on me.

31:41.934 --> 31:43.000
I can't get out of here.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.928
Open the door!

31:45.371 --> 31:48.038
I'm on my way.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.579
147 Coconut Drive.

31:51.377 --> 31:56.847
Um, I have an emergency,
and, I need to leave.

31:56.849 --> 31:58.942
Sounds very familiar.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.152
I'm sorry.

32:01.154 --> 32:03.053
Time to come out, little bunny.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.221
We go live in 3 minutes.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.956
Stay the hell away from me!

32:05.958 --> 32:07.892
Open the Goddamn door!

32:09.395 --> 32:12.329
Where is she?!

32:12.331 --> 32:14.565
Virginia! Kick his ass!

32:14.567 --> 32:16.634
Virginia!

32:18.204 --> 32:19.204
Run!

32:20.740 --> 32:22.072
Go!

32:25.211 --> 32:26.744
So, whatcha gonna watch now?

32:28.881 --> 32:30.581
What is wrong with you, China Doll?

32:30.583 --> 32:34.144
Why do you keep doing stupid shit?

32:34.854 --> 32:37.354
What else am I supposed to do?

32:37.356 --> 32:40.291
I worked so hard to get my nails better,

32:40.293 --> 32:42.326
for all of you guys to like me,

32:42.328 --> 32:44.321
to be a part of your stupid...

32:47.099 --> 32:49.099
I'm sorry for ruining your date.

32:49.101 --> 32:51.068
What you need to be sorry about is that

32:51.070 --> 32:53.971
you almost got yourself
killed back there.

32:53.973 --> 32:56.273
Ain't you tired yet, Virginia?

32:56.275 --> 33:00.277
Sucking dick, turning trick,
all this nonsense.

33:02.882 --> 33:04.415
Girl.

33:04.417 --> 33:07.636
There's a certain type of dirty
you can't wash out.

33:08.988 --> 33:11.655
Get your shit together, Virginia.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.433
You hear me?

33:13.960 --> 33:17.161
Get it together.
Get a good night's rest,

33:17.163 --> 33:19.363
'cause you're competing
at NailPalm tomorrow.

33:19.365 --> 33:20.564
What?

33:20.566 --> 33:21.765
What?

33:21.767 --> 33:22.900
I'm going?!

33:22.902 --> 33:24.134
Ain't that what I just said?

33:24.136 --> 33:25.970
Ann, I'm going to NailPa...

33:25.972 --> 33:26.971
You are.

33:26.973 --> 33:28.038
My God.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.206
Thank you!

33:29.208 --> 33:31.208
Okay, okay, okay.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.477
Ann, am I really going to NailPalm?

33:33.479 --> 33:34.704
You're going.

33:34.729 --> 33:36.665
Okay.

33:37.450 --> 33:38.582
Ann, step on it.

33:47.332 --> 33:49.132
What is wrong with your face?

33:49.134 --> 33:50.700
I hate my roller set.

33:50.702 --> 33:52.202
I feel like I look like Curly Sue.

33:52.204 --> 33:56.306
Girl, you are giving me
Diana Ross realness, okay?

33:56.308 --> 33:58.108
Well, I'll take it.

33:58.110 --> 33:59.175
Be still.

33:59.177 --> 34:01.745
Spillsie, I ran out on
the good doctor again

34:01.747 --> 34:03.279
'cause of Virginia's bullshit.

34:03.281 --> 34:04.581
No, you did not.

34:04.583 --> 34:06.416
Yes, I did, and I
haven't heard from him,

34:06.418 --> 34:08.418
so I know he thinks I'm a flake.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.020
He does not think you are a flake.

34:10.022 --> 34:12.422
You have a complicated life.

34:12.424 --> 34:13.757
Wait.

34:13.759 --> 34:15.891
And Virginia is an idiot.

34:17.362 --> 34:18.661
Babe, do I need to say the thing

34:18.663 --> 34:20.063
about the fish in the sea?

34:20.065 --> 34:21.664
There's so many...
You know how many piranhas

34:21.666 --> 34:23.233
I had to rim before I met Bryce?

34:24.569 --> 34:26.002
I know the last few days
have been eventful,

34:26.004 --> 34:29.406
but we're gonna turn shit around.

34:29.408 --> 34:31.636
What happened with your thumb?

34:32.710 --> 34:34.010
I hurt it.

34:34.012 --> 34:35.578
Bryce let on that
he's gonna be doing more

34:35.580 --> 34:37.380
than just the clinic with Uncle Daddy,

34:37.382 --> 34:39.149
but we talked about it,

34:39.150 --> 34:41.353
and I feel like it's gonna be fine.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.020
Y'all were doing so good.

34:44.022 --> 34:45.855
Yeah, I know, but now,
you know, with the house,

34:45.857 --> 34:47.190
it's a little more complicated,

34:47.192 --> 34:49.659
and I just feel like
if we get a few months,

34:49.661 --> 34:51.194
- then we'll be able...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:51.196 --> 34:55.498
You were the one that said
the Hussers were like quicksand,

34:55.500 --> 34:57.667
and you were right, okay?

34:57.669 --> 35:01.538
Uncle Daddy is... is
an unhinged lunatic.

35:01.540 --> 35:03.139
Girl.

35:03.141 --> 35:06.309
You gonna have to give that house back.

35:06.311 --> 35:08.845
- What?
- It's not worth it.

35:08.847 --> 35:10.213
Well, that's easy for you to say, Des.

35:10.215 --> 35:12.082
I got kids to think about.
I got a family.

35:12.084 --> 35:13.817
I am thinking about your family.

35:13.819 --> 35:15.585
- For real?
- Yeah.

35:15.587 --> 35:16.786
You're not a little bit mad

35:16.788 --> 35:18.054
that I got the house that you wanted?

35:18.056 --> 35:20.423
- Wow.
- 'Cause it seems like you are.

35:20.425 --> 35:22.325
Okay, that right there is not fair.

35:22.327 --> 35:24.494
What's not fair is that you
think that I don't deserve it,

35:24.496 --> 35:26.062
that I didn't work hard.

35:26.064 --> 35:28.164
I can't have nice things,
my girls can't have nice things?

35:28.166 --> 35:31.701
I don't understand.
Why can't you be happy for me?

35:31.703 --> 35:33.069
Happy for you?

35:33.071 --> 35:35.905
You want me to be happy
for you that your husband

35:35.907 --> 35:38.675
is officially in the Dixie Mafia,

35:38.677 --> 35:40.043
- which...
- Shh.

35:40.045 --> 35:43.279
Which makes you officially a mob wife.

35:43.281 --> 35:44.581
What does that make you?

35:44.583 --> 35:46.749
Are we not doing the exact same thing?

35:46.751 --> 35:48.118
My situation is different.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.720
Girl, can you come down off the cross?

35:50.722 --> 35:52.422
We need the wood.

35:52.424 --> 35:54.584
You don't think this is
just a little bit hypocritical?

35:55.393 --> 35:57.026
You know what? I love you.

35:57.028 --> 36:00.430
I'm gonna go inside and get a good seat

36:00.432 --> 36:01.698
so I can support you,

36:01.700 --> 36:03.566
which is what real friends do.

36:22.087 --> 36:23.553
Clay.

36:23.555 --> 36:24.821
Chip.

36:24.823 --> 36:26.156
That the new partner?

36:26.158 --> 36:28.691
How's it going?

36:28.693 --> 36:30.193
We got nothing in common.

36:30.195 --> 36:33.796
Doesn't go to the track
or drink, doesn't even watch TV,

36:33.798 --> 36:35.298
not even the "NCIS's."

36:35.300 --> 36:36.533
- Chip.
- What?

36:36.535 --> 36:37.934
Don't let the fact that
I haven't shot you yet

36:37.936 --> 36:39.969
signal interest in your words.

36:39.971 --> 36:42.058
I just want to know
if she gonna be a problem.

36:42.841 --> 36:44.908
I've met chipmunks smarter
than that one.

36:44.910 --> 36:46.646
That's what I want to hear.

36:47.078 --> 36:49.746
I got a little thank you
for the Coombs situation.

36:49.748 --> 36:51.414
Ooh, thank you.

36:51.416 --> 36:53.249
I'll bring you up to Georgia,

36:53.251 --> 36:55.985
see about getting you a role
in our expansion up there.

36:55.987 --> 36:58.241
I like the sound of that. Thank you.

37:03.161 --> 37:05.061
<i>Why can't you be happy for me?</i>

37:06.965 --> 37:08.752
<i>That's what real friends do.</i>

37:21.213 --> 37:24.414
Hello, welcome to NailPalm!

37:28.587 --> 37:30.687
I'm your host, Peggy Lipton.

37:32.891 --> 37:34.224
Here you go, folks.

37:34.226 --> 37:38.661
The theme for Round 1 is
Signs of Springtime.

37:38.663 --> 37:41.130
You've got 20 minutes. Go!

37:53.578 --> 37:56.346
Round 2, Travel Through Time.

38:15.967 --> 38:20.603
Round 3, Female Icons.

38:26.344 --> 38:28.077
<i>As the rhythm designed to bounce.</i>

38:44.696 --> 38:49.832
The teams that will compete
in the finals are...

38:49.834 --> 38:53.670
Mrs. Kim's Best Nail Girls...

38:53.672 --> 38:55.805
and Desna's Divas.

39:02.213 --> 39:05.181
Now, the best stylist from each team

39:05.183 --> 39:08.751
will compete in
a headtohead challenge.

39:08.753 --> 39:10.753
You got this.

39:25.537 --> 39:29.238
You know, it's been a while
since I've exposed my...

39:29.240 --> 39:34.711
my life, my art to anyone, Mr. Emerson.

39:34.713 --> 39:37.358
And it's very difficult for me.

39:38.016 --> 39:39.082
My dearest.

39:39.084 --> 39:40.570
Ilt's very difficult.

39:41.152 --> 39:45.955
My deepest desire is to know
all of you, Miss Honeychurch.

39:45.957 --> 39:47.994
Every little bit of you.

39:48.593 --> 39:52.228
Actually, I
want to know all of you, Gladys.

39:54.232 --> 39:55.998
Aah! Not Gladys.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.468
We've been over this. Miss Honeychurch.

39:58.470 --> 40:01.037
You can keep on shocking me,

40:01.039 --> 40:03.840
but...

40:07.178 --> 40:08.411
Aah!

40:13.785 --> 40:16.953
I want to know all of you.

40:16.955 --> 40:18.287
Aah!

40:18.289 --> 40:20.752
But you will reveal yourself to me,

40:21.960 --> 40:23.326
all of you.

40:25.930 --> 40:28.264
This is destiny.

40:28.266 --> 40:29.866
Show me.

40:47.619 --> 40:50.353
It's called "Woolly Knickers."

40:50.355 --> 40:53.656
It's constructed entirely
from pubic hair collected

40:53.658 --> 40:57.397
at the Hernando Correctional Institute.

40:58.029 --> 41:00.263
It won me a MacArthur Genius Grant,

41:00.265 --> 41:02.632
but some douche critic called it

41:02.634 --> 41:06.569
a ludicrously conceived,
pompously titled joke.

41:09.374 --> 41:11.240
You hate it.

41:11.242 --> 41:15.144
I don't know why I thought
somebody like you would like it.

41:19.544 --> 41:21.884
It's just so beautiful.

41:25.790 --> 41:27.290
And then there were two.

41:27.292 --> 41:30.460
Our last theme is Self Portrait.

41:30.462 --> 41:33.596
Ladies, look deep inside yourself.

41:33.598 --> 41:35.198
Who are you?

41:39.204 --> 41:41.437
You're a hypocrite, Desna.

42:09.167 --> 42:11.133
Jennifer, this is
making me very anxious.

42:11.135 --> 42:12.568
I know, baby, she's gonna pull through.

42:12.570 --> 42:13.528
She's gonna pull through.

42:13.553 --> 42:15.905
- Watch, watch.
- Okay.

42:15.907 --> 42:17.240
Hey!

42:17.242 --> 42:19.208
Come on, girl. You got this.

42:19.210 --> 42:20.376
You better get it.

42:20.378 --> 42:22.478
Come on! Come on, girl.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.579
You got this!

42:23.581 --> 42:25.081
It's okay, Desna, you can do it.

42:25.083 --> 42:28.150
- Yeah, we're right here.
- We got you.

42:28.152 --> 42:29.185
Who's better than you?

42:29.187 --> 42:30.720
- Nobody.
- Come on, Des.

42:32.023 --> 42:33.990
That's right! That's right.

42:33.992 --> 42:35.992
Yes.

42:35.994 --> 42:37.193
Whoo! All right!

42:37.195 --> 42:38.628
Don't cry, Des. Don't cry.

42:38.630 --> 42:41.464
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

42:41.466 --> 42:43.299
Whoo!

42:46.404 --> 42:48.271
She rolling up her sleeves now.

42:48.273 --> 42:50.439
- Hey!
- Yeah!

42:52.443 --> 42:55.611
Yes, babe!

42:55.613 --> 42:57.246
Whoo, come on, now!

42:57.248 --> 43:00.550
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

43:00.552 --> 43:03.886
Ooh, you got this.

43:03.888 --> 43:07.623
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

43:07.625 --> 43:14.130
Yes, yes, yes!

43:14.132 --> 43:15.331
Yes she will! Come on, now!

43:15.333 --> 43:17.366
That's right, that's right!

43:31.006 --> 43:35.213
Ladies, can you please explain
your work to the judges?

43:35.267 --> 43:37.166
Of course.

43:37.168 --> 43:40.903
My parents immigrated
to this country with nothing,

43:40.905 --> 43:44.107
and now I own my own business.

43:44.109 --> 43:45.408
I'm proud of myself.

43:45.410 --> 43:47.076
My nails reflect my pride.

43:47.078 --> 43:52.982
Like me, they are strong,
female, and professional.

43:52.984 --> 43:54.117
Thank you so much.

43:55.420 --> 43:58.054
And Desna, can you explain your nails?

44:04.963 --> 44:11.234
My life hasn't been easy, ever.

44:11.236 --> 44:14.771
I watched people around me
get the success I dreamed of,

44:14.773 --> 44:17.473
and because of that,
I made some mistakes.

44:19.477 --> 44:22.779
But I got my brother, and I got my crew.

44:25.083 --> 44:31.821
And um, my nails... those nails are me.

44:31.823 --> 44:37.366
They are chaotic,
complicated, but loving.

44:38.229 --> 44:40.063
Loved.

44:42.934 --> 44:44.967
That's all I got.

44:44.969 --> 44:46.803
Thank you.

44:52.477 --> 44:57.480
And the winner of NailPalm 2017

44:57.482 --> 45:03.119
and the $15,000 prize is...

45:03.121 --> 45:04.253
Desna Simms!

45:04.255 --> 45:07.890
Me?!

45:07.892 --> 45:10.827
My God!

45:19.904 --> 45:24.374
My God.

45:24.376 --> 45:26.409
My God!

45:32.584 --> 45:37.120
What... What... What are you doing here?

45:37.122 --> 45:40.638
Can I interest you
in a congratulatory drink?

45:42.394 --> 45:44.961
I was gonna go celebrate with my girls,

45:44.963 --> 45:47.812
but you're welcome to come with us.

45:48.700 --> 45:51.234
- I would love to.
- Yeah?

45:51.236 --> 45:52.435
This is for you.

45:52.437 --> 45:54.303
Thank you.

45:54.305 --> 45:55.538
I'm gonna introduce you.

45:55.540 --> 45:58.074
They're gonna be weird, though, okay?

45:58.076 --> 45:59.275
- Hey.
- Hello.

45:59.277 --> 46:00.743
Are those all your real teeth?

46:00.745 --> 46:03.279
They are beautiful.

46:06.017 --> 46:08.985
Baby.

46:08.987 --> 46:11.143
You gotta go to your art show.

46:12.390 --> 46:13.689
You have to.

46:13.691 --> 46:17.059
I mean, look at these creations.

46:17.061 --> 46:19.595
They speak to
the Goddamn human experience.

46:19.597 --> 46:22.432
But how could I leave you?

46:22.434 --> 46:24.033
III'll be fine.

46:24.035 --> 46:26.235
You'll leave a little food by the bed,

46:26.237 --> 46:30.506
and maybe extend the chain
just an inch or two

46:30.508 --> 46:32.356
so I can use the toilet.

46:34.179 --> 46:36.779
I shall go to Art South Beach,

46:36.781 --> 46:39.916
Mr. Emerson, with you as my muse.

46:39.918 --> 46:42.051
I will show Jerry Salz

46:42.053 --> 46:48.291
and those other poseurs
what real art is.

46:48.293 --> 46:52.061
I'm gonna run to the art store
before it closes.

46:52.063 --> 46:53.463
Supplies!

46:53.465 --> 46:54.997
Supplies.

46:54.999 --> 46:57.867
Hurry back!

47:06.945 --> 47:11.013
<i>Who is this? Mr. Emerson!</i>

47:11.015 --> 47:16.118
You got me so riled up that
I forgot my... my telephone.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.820
Screw the art store.

47:17.822 --> 47:19.622
I'll go tomorrow.

47:21.459 --> 47:23.025
Thanks for dropping me off, Jennifer.

47:23.027 --> 47:27.663
So, Virginia and I are going
to go to South Beach together.

47:27.665 --> 47:29.398
Does your sister know?

47:29.400 --> 47:30.733
Well, not yet.

47:30.735 --> 47:32.768
Here are the pencils your kids wanted.

47:32.770 --> 47:35.505
That's those realestate people?

47:35.507 --> 47:37.106
Why'd you do that?

47:37.108 --> 47:39.308
Yeah, they... they hurt me
when I was little.

47:39.310 --> 47:41.577
Desna said one day karma
was gonna get them,

47:41.579 --> 47:43.112
and karma did.
