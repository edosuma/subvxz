00:34.460 --> 00:36.440
Bravo!

00:38.300 --> 00:39.920
Bravo!

00:50.460 --> 00:52.240
Thanks to Zak Sowande,

00:52.300 --> 00:55.680
the last of our very talented
finalists

00:55.740 --> 00:58.600
and a sensational start to this
year's Thassingham Festival.

01:02.460 --> 01:06.760
The Falconer Bursary Award
has helped establish

01:06.820 --> 01:10.000
many of today's leading
classical artists.

01:10.060 --> 01:12.440
Members of the festival
have voted online

01:12.500 --> 01:15.000
for the musician they felt
was most deserving

01:15.060 --> 01:18.160
and the results,
as they say, are now in.

01:18.220 --> 01:20.240
And the winner is...

01:24.100 --> 01:25.200
..Jacob Wheeler.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.640
(SPORADIC APPLAUSE)

01:34.100 --> 01:36.520
Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:36.580 --> 01:38.280
Congratulations, Jacob.
Thank you.

01:38.340 --> 01:40.200
You'll be able to enjoy
his exceptional playing

01:40.260 --> 01:41.560
after the interval.

01:41.620 --> 01:45.360
In the meantime, why not enjoy
a delicious Rafferty's Gin cocktail

01:45.420 --> 01:46.520
outside on the lawn?

01:52.260 --> 01:54.280
(CHATTER)

01:57.500 --> 02:00.120
Good luck, darling!
You'll be brilliant.

02:00.180 --> 02:02.440
Thanks, Mum.
Enjoy.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.880
Cheers.
ALL: Cheers.

02:04.940 --> 02:07.640
You should've won,
that's what everyone's saying.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.640
But I didn't, did I, Dad?

02:12.220 --> 02:14.200
Fancy a snifter, my love.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.600
I'm not lining their pockets
and neither are you.

02:16.660 --> 02:19.000
I play so much better
with a drop taken.

02:19.060 --> 02:21.600
No, Vernon, you just think you do.

02:21.660 --> 02:24.320
Cheer up, darling, it's the festival.

02:24.380 --> 02:26.400
(CORK POPS)

02:26.460 --> 02:28.720
See you in there.
Yeah.

02:32.740 --> 02:34.280
Hey!

02:34.340 --> 02:36.840
Told you I'd do you proud, sis.
Congratulations.

02:38.140 --> 02:39.640
Well done, Jacob.

02:41.220 --> 02:42.280
Hang on one second.

02:47.940 --> 02:49.680
Hey.

02:49.740 --> 02:50.680
No hard feelings, mate.

02:52.140 --> 02:54.400
It's cool. The best man won.

03:00.460 --> 03:03.480
Dad.
Not now, Dan.

03:23.020 --> 03:24.600
Thank you.

03:24.660 --> 03:26.160
As some of you perhaps know,

03:26.220 --> 03:28.240
at the festival this year,

03:28.300 --> 03:31.040
we will be performing my long-awaited
ninth symphony.

03:31.100 --> 03:35.640
And tonight, as a prelude,
our award winner, Jacob Wheeler,

03:35.700 --> 03:38.600
will lead the orchestra in a rather
fiery last movement

03:38.660 --> 03:40.360
of my eighth symphony.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.960
So, ladies and gentlemen,
Jacob Wheeler.

03:49.180 --> 03:51.440
Jacob Wheeler, ladies and gentlemen.

Can I open the wine now?

05:57.820 --> 05:59.000
Look.

05:59.060 --> 06:02.160
I'm only two chapters in
and I've already got writer's block.

06:02.220 --> 06:04.080
According to the mystery
writers' blog,

06:04.140 --> 06:06.640
putting myself through
the same emotional experience

06:06.700 --> 06:09.080
as my characters can inspire
a breakthrough.

06:09.140 --> 06:10.320
Please.

06:10.380 --> 06:11.320
OK.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.240
OK, so we're at the convent,

06:15.300 --> 06:18.280
the novice nun has just
uncovered the Rev. Mother's secret,

06:18.340 --> 06:20.960
so she tries to drag her down
the stairs to the crypt.

06:21.020 --> 06:23.480
So, I'm in nun now?
No!

06:23.540 --> 06:24.680
That's her secret.

06:24.740 --> 06:26.840
She's a man masquerading as a nun.

06:26.900 --> 06:27.840
OK?

06:27.900 --> 06:28.920
Now, grab me!

06:35.820 --> 06:37.320
Oh!

06:37.380 --> 06:38.720
I did knock.

06:38.780 --> 06:40.520
Hi, Jamie.

06:40.580 --> 06:41.840
We were just doing
a bit of role play.

06:43.020 --> 06:44.840
Not that kind of role play.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.640
For the first murder scene
in my novel.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.920
Murder? So you're writing
historical romance.

06:48.980 --> 06:50.840
Romance is dead, apparently.

07:00.260 --> 07:02.120
Hello, stranger.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.080
You miss me, then?
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

07:05.460 --> 07:07.720
Good to see you back, Kam.
Good to be back.

07:10.900 --> 07:14.880
It's the opening night
of the Thassingham Music Festival,

07:14.940 --> 07:16.440
run by Michael Falconer.

07:16.500 --> 07:20.280
He's a pretty big deal,
both as a conductor and a composer.

07:20.340 --> 07:23.560
He owns the estate and his ensemble
play here every summer.

07:23.620 --> 07:24.880
Who's the victim?

07:24.940 --> 07:27.320
Jacob Wheeler, violinist.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.120
How did he die?

07:29.180 --> 07:32.040
Death by ligature strangulation.

07:32.100 --> 07:35.360
In the ligature in question looks
suspiciously like a violin string.

07:35.420 --> 07:36.960
Time of death?

07:37.020 --> 07:39.440
From the bruising,
I'd say an hour ago.

07:39.500 --> 07:43.240
Looks like the perpetrator
surprised him from behind.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.520
Anything else?

07:44.580 --> 07:46.920
He has some sheet music
forced down his throat.

07:46.980 --> 07:48.800
Any idea what it is?

07:48.860 --> 07:50.920
Not yet, I'll know more tomorrow.

07:52.060 --> 07:53.280
Who found the body?

07:53.340 --> 07:55.760
Candice Rafferty,
she's a member of the orchestra

07:55.820 --> 07:57.880
and Michael Falconer's niece.

07:59.180 --> 08:01.320
I wasn't in the first
part of the program...

08:03.540 --> 08:05.520
..so I went outside to get some air.

08:06.460 --> 08:08.880
What was your relationship
with Jacob?

08:11.340 --> 08:12.640
We were in the orchestra together.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.640
Friends.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.000
My daughter has been through a lot,
Inspector.

08:18.060 --> 08:19.280
Surely, you can do this tomorrow.

08:19.340 --> 08:22.400
She has been fingerprinted
for elimination, sir.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.160
That's fine, Mr Rafferty.

08:24.220 --> 08:25.320
We'll be in touch.

08:31.060 --> 08:32.360
Was anyone else at the scene?

08:33.580 --> 08:34.720
Not that we know of.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.880
His sister Natalie
was also in the orchestra,

08:36.940 --> 08:38.640
her boyfriend's taken her home.

08:38.700 --> 08:41.080
She lives in the next village,
Finchmere.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.600
Sir.

08:42.660 --> 08:46.240
I thought you should know, there's
no sign of Jacob Wheeler's violin.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.000
Thanks, Kam.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.240
Get Uniform onto it.

08:49.300 --> 08:50.400
Will do.

08:50.460 --> 08:51.760
Michael.

08:51.820 --> 08:55.000
The phone lines have been jammed
with people wanting refunds!

08:55.060 --> 08:56.280
No need to panic.

08:56.340 --> 08:58.240
How can you be so calm?

08:58.300 --> 09:01.000
The entire festival might
have to be cancelled!

09:01.060 --> 09:04.720
Mr Falconer, DCI Barnaby, DS Winter.

09:04.780 --> 09:05.920
Michael Falconer.

09:05.980 --> 09:09.320
This is my sister, Janey.
We run the festival together.

09:09.380 --> 09:10.720
Any news, Inspector?

09:11.660 --> 09:14.600
It appears Jacob Wheeler's
violin is missing.

09:14.660 --> 09:15.880
The Stradivarius?

09:16.820 --> 09:19.160
So, quite valuable?
Yes, very.

09:19.220 --> 09:22.200
It was on loan
from a Dutch conservatoire.

09:22.260 --> 09:24.800
Jacob was very careful,
he never let it out of his sight.

09:24.860 --> 09:26.880
Anything distinctive about it?

09:26.940 --> 09:28.800
Well, it's a Stradivarius.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.800
It had a specific pattern.

09:30.860 --> 09:34.360
And its colour,
it's an exquisite red.

09:34.420 --> 09:36.600
Yes, it's...red.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.880
So that's why he was killed?

09:38.940 --> 09:40.080
For the violin?

09:40.140 --> 09:41.360
It's a possibility, yes.

09:44.940 --> 09:48.560
Miss Wheeler, can you think why
anyone might want your brother dead?

09:49.660 --> 09:50.920
Any feuds?

09:50.980 --> 09:52.360
Disputes of any kind?

09:52.420 --> 09:54.680
No, nothing.

09:54.740 --> 09:56.440
What about his personal life?

09:56.500 --> 09:58.080
Any significant relationships?

09:59.060 --> 10:01.120
He was completely
dedicated to music.

10:02.180 --> 10:04.920
He didn't have time
for anything else.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.080
And you shared this house together?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.600
It's their family home.

10:08.660 --> 10:10.440
Have your parents been informed?

10:11.580 --> 10:12.720
They died...

10:13.940 --> 10:16.840
..five years ago in a car crash.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.000
I'm sorry.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.120
Can this really not wait?

10:22.260 --> 10:24.920
We'd just like to take
a look at Jacob's room.

10:28.820 --> 10:31.320
Looks like Jacob liked to party.

10:39.580 --> 10:40.640
Sir?

10:43.940 --> 10:47.920
Seems Jacob Wheeler wasn't quite the
loner he led his sister to believe.

10:50.940 --> 10:54.520
How well did you know Jacob,
Mr Falconer?

10:54.580 --> 10:55.760
I'd say we were friends.

10:55.820 --> 10:58.640
Met each other a few times
when we were younger.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.120
We found evidence
of lipstick in his room.

11:01.180 --> 11:02.640
Do you know if he had a girlfriend?

11:02.700 --> 11:05.200
Jacob was very attractive to women.

11:05.260 --> 11:07.480
Let's just say
he took full advantage.

11:07.540 --> 11:09.440
Miss Wheeler didn't seem
to think so.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.160
I don't think she wanted to know.

11:11.220 --> 11:12.400
Anyone who didn't like him?

11:13.660 --> 11:16.200
Vernon De Harthog and him had
a bit of a history.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.000
They didn't get on.
Who's he?

11:18.060 --> 11:19.560
A viola player with the ensemble.

11:19.620 --> 11:21.480
Where might we find him?
(SNIGGERS)

11:21.540 --> 11:24.560
At the Thassingham Olde,
propping up the bar.

11:24.620 --> 11:26.760
Come on, Vernon. That's enough.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.200
I'm just steadying the nerves.

11:30.140 --> 11:32.720
Darling, I'm shaking like a leaf.

11:32.780 --> 11:33.760
It's called the DTs.

11:35.180 --> 11:37.120
Mr De Harthog.

11:37.180 --> 11:39.880
DCI Barnaby, DS Winter.

11:39.940 --> 11:42.160
I believe you knew Jacob Wheeler.

11:42.220 --> 11:44.040
We played in the same
orchestra together.

11:44.980 --> 11:46.680
That's about as far as it went.

11:46.740 --> 11:47.880
We were told that you didn't get on.

11:48.940 --> 11:52.120
We had the odd spat,
nothing serious.

11:52.180 --> 11:55.720
Vernon is a big softy at heart.
People take advantage.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.040
And you are?

11:57.100 --> 11:59.160
Audrey Glenhill, I'm the landlady.

11:59.220 --> 12:01.280
Vernon lives as me
when he's not on tour.

12:01.340 --> 12:03.960
Audrey and I are old friends.

12:04.020 --> 12:06.880
She more or less ran the festival
when she and I first met.

12:06.940 --> 12:08.360
The good old days.

12:08.420 --> 12:11.360
When Thassingham was still
a real community event

12:11.420 --> 12:13.040
and ticket prices were low.

12:13.940 --> 12:16.680
Free, if you didn't have the cash.
And now they're not?

12:16.740 --> 12:19.880
No, this year Michael
upped all the ticket prices

12:19.940 --> 12:22.720
and replaced all the bars
I'd ran for years

12:22.780 --> 12:26.000
with his sister's trendy
new gin business.

12:26.060 --> 12:28.760
Now it's just corporate
entertainment

12:28.820 --> 12:31.560
for the dicky bow brigade.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.120
It's Zak Sowande
I feel most sorry for.

12:34.180 --> 12:36.440
Oh, that boy's a musical genius.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.600
He absolutely deserved
to win that award.

12:38.660 --> 12:40.920
The Falconer Bursary Award?

12:40.980 --> 12:42.120
Let's just put it this way,

12:42.180 --> 12:47.160
Jacob Wheeler was not exactly
the people's choice.

12:50.660 --> 12:53.080
Jacob was Michael's favourite.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.360
He didn't bother to hide it.
Dad!

12:54.420 --> 12:55.680
It's the truth.

12:56.940 --> 12:58.720
He didn't even need that money.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.360
But Zak does?

13:00.420 --> 13:03.120
He's got a place
at a top music college.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.040
Without that bursary,
it's out of the question.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.400
He got more votes than I did.
End of.

13:07.460 --> 13:09.160
(SNIGGERS) I would love
to believe that.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.760
You think the vote was fixed?

13:10.820 --> 13:12.520
I wouldn't put it past him.

13:12.580 --> 13:14.320
Every festival member
I know voted for Zak.

13:14.380 --> 13:15.520
It's not right!

13:17.580 --> 13:19.760
Not a lot of love for the Falconers.

13:19.820 --> 13:22.000
Check out the online voting,
see if it could be open to abuse.

13:22.060 --> 13:23.200
Yes, sir.

13:23.260 --> 13:27.200
And find out whether the award
automatically passes to the candidate

13:27.260 --> 13:28.800
with the next highest vote.

13:28.860 --> 13:30.560
Will do.

13:30.620 --> 13:32.960
Dad, just let it go.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.600
I'll get a job, start earning.
No.

13:35.660 --> 13:37.280
You keep practising.

13:37.340 --> 13:39.000
This matters more to you
than it does to me.

13:39.060 --> 13:40.440
I'm not letting you
waste your talent!

13:42.300 --> 13:43.440
I'll find the money somehow.

13:44.660 --> 13:45.720
How?

13:46.940 --> 13:48.240
Let me worry about that.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.480
Yes, of course, I understand.

15:40.260 --> 15:41.920
Hello?

16:01.940 --> 16:05.240
I didn't notice anything unusual
until I came in here

16:05.300 --> 16:08.520
and saw that the door was open
and the window had been broken.

16:08.580 --> 16:10.080
Was anyone else in at the time?

16:10.140 --> 16:12.920
I was upstairs having a shower
but didn't hear anything.

16:12.980 --> 16:14.800
So, nothing's been taken?

16:14.860 --> 16:15.840
Not that we're aware of.

16:17.100 --> 16:20.160
How well did you know

16:20.220 --> 16:21.240
Not very.

16:21.300 --> 16:24.560
You didn't talk to him yesterday?
See anything unusual?

16:24.620 --> 16:26.800
No. Why?

16:26.860 --> 16:28.520
You think this could be connected?

16:28.580 --> 16:32.000
Not many opportunist thieves
ignore cash and laptops.

16:32.060 --> 16:33.880
That's what Hamish said.

16:33.940 --> 16:35.640
Where could we find your husband?

16:35.700 --> 16:38.680
He's in the botanical garden
behind the distillery.

You'll see the greenhouse.

16:41.580 --> 16:42.720
Thank you.

We're all rather unsettled,
as you can imagine.

16:50.860 --> 16:53.000
But you didn't see or hear anything?

16:53.060 --> 16:54.720
None of us did.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.160
Interesting plants.

16:56.220 --> 16:59.040
Well, we grow our own botanicals
for the infusions.

16:59.100 --> 17:01.280
There's lavender for the dry gin

17:01.340 --> 17:04.200
and the coriander
for a more lemony twist.

17:04.260 --> 17:08.040
And green anise and sweet fennel
for the absinthe we're developing.

17:08.100 --> 17:09.760

18:32.380 --> 18:33.600
Celebration of death,

18:33.660 --> 18:36.600
it comes from a symphonic poem
by Gustav Mahler.

18:36.660 --> 18:38.880
Sounds like someone's playing games.

18:38.940 --> 18:41.680
Also found this near the body.

18:41.740 --> 18:46.520
It's a solid form of rosin obtained
from plants, mainly conifers.

18:46.580 --> 18:47.840
What's it used for?

18:47.900 --> 18:51.720
It's rubbed on the bow hair
to enhance grip and improve tone.

18:51.780 --> 18:54.200
It seems like an unusual brand.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.880
We'll need to track down
where these came from.

18:55.940 --> 18:58.240
There's a music shop in Thassingham
that supplies the orchestra.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.800
They might be able to help.

a set yesterday.

19:29.220 --> 19:30.400
And this?

19:32.140 --> 19:34.560
Oh, that's an Italian rosin.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.960
It contains particles of gold.

19:37.020 --> 19:38.640
Is that a stock item?

I shall have to call in the loan.

to get back on our feet.

22:01.660 --> 22:03.320
It's impossible.
Then make it possible.

..with the horrific
murder of Jacob Wheeler.

22:47.580 --> 22:51.440
Could this grisly death
signify a return to the...

..curse of the ninth?

22:53.900 --> 22:55.960

22:56.020 --> 22:57.720
It's a well-known superstition

22:57.780 --> 22:59.920
in the classical music world,
apparently.

22:59.980 --> 23:04.360

symphony, they're destined to die.

that you might have a copy.

23:34.620 --> 23:36.800
Yes, there should be a complete

in the orchestra.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.280
Well, it is his money, Hamish.

25:23.340 --> 25:25.120

I say we play on.

27:09.900 --> 27:13.240
Not for me, but for Jacob.
To honour his memory.

27:17.340 --> 27:18.440
I'll take that as a yes.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.280
Shall we go from the beginning?

27:30.460 --> 27:31.720

27:31.780 --> 27:33.920
It's in the library records,
but it's not signed out.

27:33.980 --> 27:36.520
Who has access?
The library's never locked.

27:36.580 --> 27:37.960
So why are we here?

27:38.020 --> 27:42.160
Kam found prints in Candice's locker
containing particles of gold

27:42.220 --> 27:44.520
from the rosin
only Jacob Wheeler used.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.520
And they also found flecks of gold

27:46.580 --> 27:48.600
in her elimination prints
taken at the scene.

27:48.660 --> 27:51.920
I'm thinking that Candice
took Jacob Wheeler's violin

27:51.980 --> 27:56.280
after finding his body and then put
her own violin in her locker.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.640
And when she left with her father,

27:58.700 --> 28:01.320
she was carrying Jacob's violin
as if it were her own.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.640
Mm-hm, and there's more,
the prints match those

28:03.700 --> 28:05.920
we found on the glass
in Jacob Wheeler's room.

28:05.980 --> 28:08.880
So Candice and Jacob
were more than just friends.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.440
I'm so sorry.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.520
If there was any way to keep you.

28:14.580 --> 28:16.440
This is a joke, right?
I wish it was.

28:17.580 --> 28:19.640
You can't do this.
It's only temporary, Warwick.

28:21.780 --> 28:25.600
I've done everything to make
this happen for you, Hamish.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.520
I've done anything that was needed.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.000
And this is how you repay me?

28:29.060 --> 28:31.000
I appreciate everything you've done.

28:31.060 --> 28:33.160
Give us time,
we'll be back on track, I swear it.

28:33.220 --> 28:34.840
I haven't got time!

28:34.900 --> 28:36.040
Warwick!

28:37.220 --> 28:38.480
Please!

28:44.580 --> 28:45.640
No, sir.

28:47.620 --> 28:50.600
Why did you lie about your
relationship with Jacob?

28:52.620 --> 28:54.040
Jacob wanted to keep it quiet.

28:55.220 --> 28:57.760
I'm Michael's niece.
He didn't want people to judge us.

28:58.860 --> 29:01.880
We have evidence to suggest
that you stole Jacob's violin

29:01.940 --> 29:03.360
after his death.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.280
Jacob's violin was all
I had left of him.

29:11.220 --> 29:13.280
I couldn't let it go.

29:13.340 --> 29:15.120
So, where is it now?

29:15.180 --> 29:16.640
I don't know.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.440
It was stolen in the break-in.

29:24.740 --> 29:26.520
There you are.

29:26.580 --> 29:28.160
You alright, Dad?

29:28.220 --> 29:29.720
Yeah, I just fancied a pint.

29:29.780 --> 29:31.160
And what can I get you?

29:31.220 --> 29:33.280
You weren't at work.
I need to talk to, Dad.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.600
You're going to have to tell him.
Tell me what?

29:38.260 --> 29:40.120
I've been laid off.
But you mustn't worry.

they like.

I put into that place.

will you, Dad?

on that site you're addicted to?

33:15.380 --> 33:17.680
It was a one off.

was for my daughter
to fall in love with him.

does he know any of this?

So obviously not competing
for lead violin.

43:03.380 --> 43:05.680
And Jacob's Stradivarius is
still missing.

43:05.740 --> 43:07.960
Then there's the famous
curse of the ninth.

43:08.020 --> 43:10.320
Someone could have been targeting
Michael's ensemble.

43:10.380 --> 43:13.240
Let's find out if there's anything
significant about the music

43:13.300 --> 43:15.680
that Vernon was playing last night.

43:15.740 --> 43:17.240
Did you notice anything unusual?

43:17.300 --> 43:18.920
There was definitely something
going on

43:18.980 --> 43:20.440
between Vernon and Dan Falconer.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.480
It looked like Vernon was trying
to tell Michael something

43:22.540 --> 43:23.520
and Dan stepped in.

43:23.580 --> 43:25.440
We'll have to ask him why.

43:25.500 --> 43:28.160
Anything more on Vernon's will?
Mm.

43:28.220 --> 43:31.280
He's owned a seaside cottage
in Brighton since the '60s,

43:31.340 --> 43:32.680
now worth a small fortune.

43:32.740 --> 43:34.120
Who's the beneficiary?

43:34.180 --> 43:36.520
Audrey Glenhill.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.400
He'd never hurt anyone.

43:38.460 --> 43:39.640
I know.

43:41.180 --> 43:42.160
It'll be OK.

43:42.220 --> 43:44.240
You just need to stay strong.

43:44.300 --> 43:46.760
I... (CLEARS THROAT)

43:48.420 --> 43:51.000
I bought you these, Audrey.

43:54.620 --> 43:58.040
I know I haven't always been
a very good friend but...

43:58.100 --> 43:59.320
You're not wanted here.

43:59.380 --> 44:00.680
I think you'd better go.

44:11.660 --> 44:13.280
I need to speak to Mrs Greenhill.

44:14.260 --> 44:15.440
Alone.

44:16.500 --> 44:18.920
The cottage is worth
a considerable sum.

44:18.980 --> 44:21.960
And left solely to you.
Had no idea.

44:24.020 --> 44:26.440
Did Vernon have any enemies
that you know of?

44:26.500 --> 44:28.600
Problematic relationships?

44:28.660 --> 44:30.040
Vernon was old-school,

44:30.100 --> 44:34.840
so he didn't fit in with Michael's
shiny new vision for the festival.

44:34.900 --> 44:37.360
Michael was trying
to get rid of him.

44:37.420 --> 44:41.240
So you both have a difficult history
with the Falconer family.

44:41.300 --> 44:46.560
Janey was my best friend
or so I thought.

44:46.620 --> 44:49.480
When she got an opportunity
to stab me in the back,

44:49.540 --> 44:51.960
she did it without giving
it a second thought.

45:09.500 --> 45:10.920
Argh!

45:13.980 --> 45:16.320
Quite a temper you've got there.

45:16.380 --> 45:18.680
I have my final audition in an hour.

45:18.740 --> 45:20.200
Can't this wait?

45:20.260 --> 45:23.400
Means a lot to you, doesn't it,
getting lead violin?

45:23.460 --> 45:26.360
Not so much that
I would murder fellow musicians

45:26.420 --> 45:28.240
if that's what you're implying.

45:28.300 --> 45:30.920
I saw you have a run in with
Mr De Harthog just before he died.

45:30.980 --> 45:33.360
I was just trying
to protect my father.

45:33.420 --> 45:36.240
This ninth symphony is
obviously important.

45:36.300 --> 45:38.200
Well, there's a lot at stake.

45:38.260 --> 45:40.000
Vernon De Harthog was a liability.

45:40.060 --> 45:42.040
And no fan of yours.

45:42.100 --> 45:46.240
Apparently he humiliated you,
belittled your talent,

45:46.300 --> 45:48.240
said that you'd never make
lead violin.

45:48.300 --> 45:50.200
Yeah,
maybe I hated him in that moment

45:50.260 --> 45:52.600
because that's what
I've believed all my life.

45:52.660 --> 45:54.840
But it was just that, a moment.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.720
Will you excuse me?

46:10.220 --> 46:12.480
MICHAEL FALCONER: Vernon could be
a complete nightmare.

46:12.540 --> 46:15.640
We understand that he tried to speak
to you before the concert?

46:15.700 --> 46:17.760
Yes, that's right.

46:17.820 --> 46:19.720
Have you any idea
what he wanted to say?

46:19.780 --> 46:20.720
No.

46:20.780 --> 46:23.640
He was keen to talk about something
but the film was about to start.

46:23.700 --> 46:26.320
What piece was Vernon playing
when he died, Mr Falconer?

46:26.380 --> 46:29.200
Schubert. Why? Is that important?

46:29.260 --> 46:30.840
Schubert is another composer

46:30.900 --> 46:32.440
associated with
the curse of the ninth.

46:32.500 --> 46:36.000
Which is why I would advise you
to postpone tomorrow's concert.

46:36.060 --> 46:37.720
Look, I'm not afraid of any curse.

46:38.940 --> 46:41.640
No, no, no.
We'll go ahead as planned.

46:46.380 --> 46:47.840
Sorry about last night.

46:47.900 --> 46:49.760
Not quite what I had planned.

46:49.820 --> 46:52.280
Well, it seems to have a habit
of getting in the way.

46:52.340 --> 46:53.880
What have you got for us, Kam?

46:53.940 --> 46:57.000
The PM results confirm death
through asphyxia.

46:57.060 --> 46:58.680
Any idea why?

47:00.580 --> 47:02.240
Strychnine poisoning.

47:02.300 --> 47:06.560
When inhaled, swallow or absorbed
through the eyes or mouth,

47:06.620 --> 47:10.880
it induces muscular convulsions
and ultimately respiratory failure.

47:10.940 --> 47:12.480
But how?

47:12.540 --> 47:16.600
We found evidence of a highly-toxic
concentration of strychnine

47:16.660 --> 47:18.880
on the strings and bow.

47:19.820 --> 47:23.200
He would have inhaled the poison
as soon as he started playing.

47:23.260 --> 47:24.800
Is it hard to get hold of?

47:24.860 --> 47:27.640
Well, commercially-produced
strychnine isn't readily available

47:27.700 --> 47:29.240
in this concentrated form.

47:29.300 --> 47:32.080
I would suggest it was freshly
ground from the seeds

47:32.140 --> 47:34.080
of a Strychnos ignatii shrub.

47:36.700 --> 47:38.840
It's from the Philippines
originally.

47:38.900 --> 47:42.680
The fruit,
known as the St Ignatius bean,

47:42.740 --> 47:45.920
contains as many as 25 seeds
embedded in its pulp.

47:45.980 --> 47:48.880
I dry them
and grind the seeds myself.

47:48.940 --> 47:51.440
And why would you do that?

47:51.500 --> 47:54.040
(EXHALES) Well, you might as well
know the truth.

47:55.780 --> 47:57.640
It's not strictly legal.

47:57.700 --> 48:03.200
We have a problem with moles
at the distillery and the manor.

48:03.260 --> 48:07.320
They've become immune to the
approved pest control solution.

48:07.380 --> 48:09.680
How is it stored?

48:09.740 --> 48:11.480
Right.

48:11.540 --> 48:13.680
Just through here.

48:13.740 --> 48:14.960
Oh...

48:16.180 --> 48:18.000
It seems to be missing.

48:18.060 --> 48:19.920
When was the last time you checked?

48:19.980 --> 48:23.520
Uh, a couple of weeks ago maybe.
Is it locked when you're not here?

48:23.580 --> 48:25.840
Always.
Who had keys?

48:25.900 --> 48:27.760
Well, me, of course.

48:27.820 --> 48:30.000
Warwick used to but he...

48:30.060 --> 48:31.680
Yes, he gave them back.

48:31.740 --> 48:33.200
We've got a spare set
in the kitchen.

48:33.260 --> 48:34.880
So, it could have been taken
in the break-in...

48:34.940 --> 48:37.520
Well, it's possible, yes. But...

48:37.580 --> 48:39.400
Well, none of our keys are missing.

48:41.820 --> 48:44.360
Call Kam. She needs to get over here.

48:44.420 --> 48:46.520
See if Hamish's homemade
mole destroyer matches the poison

48:46.580 --> 48:48.440
that killed Vernon.

48:48.500 --> 48:51.000
Will do. I've just got Vernon's
phone records through.

48:51.060 --> 48:53.320
It looks like he sent
an interesting text to Warwick

48:53.380 --> 48:55.720
the day he died - "I'm onto you."

49:17.180 --> 49:18.800
Well done, Daniel!

49:18.860 --> 49:21.240
I can see you've worked very hard.

49:21.300 --> 49:23.040
Thank you.

49:23.100 --> 49:24.600
But I've made my decision...

49:26.180 --> 49:28.200
..Natalie Wheeler will be
lead violin.

49:30.380 --> 49:31.920
It wasn't an easy decision.

49:31.980 --> 49:35.880
She's just more suited
to the emotional range of the work.

49:37.740 --> 49:41.080
You were never going
to give it to me, were you?

49:41.140 --> 49:43.640
Vernon was right.
Dan, Vernon...

49:43.700 --> 49:45.400
Do you know what people are saying?

49:45.460 --> 49:47.400
That Michael Falconer's genius
is fading.

49:47.460 --> 49:49.080
Are they?

49:49.140 --> 49:51.360
Well, at least I was touched
by it once or twice,

49:51.420 --> 49:52.920

You know, I've supported you,

49:56.940 --> 49:58.640
I've protected you,
I've defended you.

but try to make me feel inadequate?

50:02.140 --> 50:03.720

to be your son.

50:04.940 --> 50:07.480
Well, congratulations.
You've done an excellent job.

50:12.460 --> 50:13.760
Dan...

50:14.940 --> 50:17.680
..you're not the only one
who's disappointed.

50:17.740 --> 50:19.600
I wanted it just as much as you.

50:19.660 --> 50:21.080
I don't think so.

50:21.140 --> 50:24.640
Maybe we just have to accept that
Natalie is the better player.

50:37.260 --> 50:38.720
"I'm onto you."

50:38.780 --> 50:40.440
What did you think he meant by that?

Vernon was all over the place
when he'd had a few,

50:42.900 --> 50:45.000
started imagining things,

50:45.060 --> 50:47.200
thought me and Audrey were
having an affair.

50:47.260 --> 50:49.000

50:49.060 --> 50:50.880
No.

of being his son.

We're good, Dad.
Been booked for a tour.

57:09.340 --> 57:12.200
You have no idea
what I've done for you.

57:15.300 --> 57:18.200
I'm just going to look
into your eye. Lovely.

57:19.700 --> 57:22.240
All the stills were turned up
to the max.

57:22.300 --> 57:24.720
Any longer and the whole place
would have gone up.

57:24.780 --> 57:25.920
OK. Thanks.

57:27.980 --> 57:32.320
Miss Wheeler, are you OK?

57:32.380 --> 57:36.320
A bit shaken and light-headed.

57:36.380 --> 57:37.960
But apart from that.

57:38.020 --> 57:40.080
You're very lucky Miss Rafferty
found you when she did.

57:40.140 --> 57:42.040
Was someone trying to kill me?

57:42.100 --> 57:43.880
We don't know that yet.

57:43.940 --> 57:45.960
Did you see anyone
or hear anything unusual

57:46.020 --> 57:47.320
before you lost consciousness?

57:47.380 --> 57:49.600
No. Not that I can remember.

57:52.700 --> 57:56.080
You and Jacob had matching
St Christophers.

57:56.140 --> 57:58.720
Our grandmother was French,
devout Catholic.

58:00.500 --> 58:02.920
She gave them to us
when we were born.

58:04.180 --> 58:05.720
Are they valuable?

58:05.780 --> 58:08.360
I think so. It's white gold.

58:08.420 --> 58:11.760
But it's more sentimental value.

58:11.820 --> 58:14.320
They were to keep us safe.

58:14.380 --> 58:16.360
She must have been
looking down on you today.

58:22.300 --> 58:24.960
She's another violinist.
Fits the profile.

58:25.020 --> 58:29.040
But this feels different. No music.
Nothing linking it to the curse.

58:29.500 --> 58:31.440
How is she, Inspector?

58:31.500 --> 58:34.760
A little disorientated but the medics
say there's no cause for concern.

58:34.820 --> 58:36.640
(SIGHS)
That's such a relief.

58:36.700 --> 58:38.640
She was very lucky Candice
was there.

58:38.700 --> 58:40.680
Yes, yes, thank God.

58:40.740 --> 58:42.400
And where were you at the time?

58:42.460 --> 58:45.720
Uh, Millminster, Leisure Centre.

58:45.780 --> 58:47.800
He swims. Every week.

58:47.860 --> 58:50.040
And you, Mrs Rafferty?

58:50.100 --> 58:53.080
I was with Michael at the manor.

58:53.140 --> 58:55.880
Can we speak to Candice?
She's in the house.

58:55.940 --> 58:58.160
But please go carefully with her.

58:58.220 --> 59:01.040
After what happened with Jacob,
she's taken this very hard.

59:03.220 --> 59:06.120
You talk to Candice while I try
and get hold of Kam.

59:06.180 --> 59:09.960
I'd like her to take another look
at Jacob's pendant.

59:10.020 --> 59:13.640
You sent Natalie a text asking her
to meet you at the distillery.

59:13.700 --> 59:15.280
Was that unusual?

59:15.340 --> 59:17.680
We haven't been very close recently.

59:17.740 --> 59:19.800
She used to come up here sometimes.

59:19.860 --> 59:21.800
I wanted to talk to her.

59:21.860 --> 59:23.400
About anything in particular?

59:23.460 --> 59:25.600
After Jacob's death...

59:26.500 --> 59:29.960
..and it all came out about me
and him, she kept her distance.

59:30.020 --> 59:33.680
I think she was angry
we had kept it all a secret.

59:33.740 --> 59:35.800
Why were you late?

59:35.860 --> 59:39.360
I had to pick up my violin from
the music shop but it wasn't ready.

59:39.420 --> 59:42.240
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

59:43.140 --> 59:45.440
All I wanted to do was
make things right.

59:47.500 --> 59:50.600
Well, she seems genuine enough
but she has her means.

59:50.660 --> 59:52.720
And whoever did this would have
to be familiar

59:52.780 --> 59:54.320
with how the distillery worked.

59:54.380 --> 59:56.040
Warwick claims
he accepted his dismissal.

59:56.100 --> 59:57.760
Do you think that was
all for our benefit?

59:57.820 --> 59:58.920
Perhaps.

59:58.980 --> 1:00:00.920
Let's speak to Audrey Glenhill.

1:00:00.980 --> 1:00:03.960
We know she has a grudge
against the Raffertys.

1:00:04.020 --> 1:00:08.360
And she may be able to enlighten us
on why Vernon had that key card.

1:00:08.420 --> 1:00:11.160
I was nowhere near the distillery.

1:00:11.220 --> 1:00:13.320
You felt that you'd lost everything
because of Janey

1:00:13.380 --> 1:00:15.360
and you wanted your own back.

1:00:15.420 --> 1:00:17.880
Do you honestly think I would have
the technical know-how

1:00:17.940 --> 1:00:19.680
to pull off a stunt like that.

1:00:19.740 --> 1:00:21.280
Your friend Warwick Sowande would.

1:00:22.300 --> 1:00:23.480
Well...

1:00:23.540 --> 1:00:26.160
It's a nice theory but you're wrong.

1:00:26.220 --> 1:00:27.640
Maybe you recognise this.

1:00:27.700 --> 1:00:30.360
It's for a safety deposit box
belonging to Jacob Wheeler.

1:00:30.420 --> 1:00:31.720
The night of Vernon died,

1:00:31.780 --> 1:00:33.280
he was seen there,
removing a passport.

1:00:33.340 --> 1:00:34.720
Do you know anything about this?

1:00:34.780 --> 1:00:36.520
No. I don't.

1:00:36.580 --> 1:00:39.000
I don't know anything
and that's the truth.

1:00:39.060 --> 1:00:41.720
Mrs Glenhill, if you're withholding
anything that could help

1:00:41.780 --> 1:00:44.640
this investigation,
you will be in serious trouble.

1:00:48.020 --> 1:00:49.800
Look...

1:00:49.860 --> 1:00:52.120
..I don't know
what Vernon was up to...

1:00:53.340 --> 1:00:56.560
..but I found Jacob's wallet
in his coat pocket.

1:00:56.620 --> 1:00:58.640
I didn't know what to think.

1:00:58.700 --> 1:01:00.000
I just told him to get rid of it.

1:01:01.620 --> 1:01:04.520
And that was the last time
I saw him.

1:01:04.580 --> 1:01:06.440
(SIGHS)

1:01:06.500 --> 1:01:10.440
(PLAYS VIOLIN SOLO)

1:01:32.500 --> 1:01:33.800
Thank you.

1:01:37.060 --> 1:01:38.880
Are you sure you're well enough
to play?

1:01:38.940 --> 1:01:41.680
I'm fine now.

1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:42.920
Honestly.

1:01:44.620 --> 1:01:47.280
I pushed you away
because I was angry.

1:01:47.340 --> 1:01:48.600
Not with you.

1:01:50.660 --> 1:01:51.960
With him.

1:02:01.860 --> 1:02:03.640
Thanks very much.

1:02:03.700 --> 1:02:05.080
Any luck with the passport?

1:02:05.140 --> 1:02:08.480
Tech can confirm it's a UK passport
but nothing else so far.

1:02:08.540 --> 1:02:11.920
However, we have had a result
on the Rafferty's finance check.

1:02:11.980 --> 1:02:14.680
A large sum of money was transferred
from the Rafferty's business account

1:02:14.740 --> 1:02:17.120
into Michael Falconer's
personal account

1:02:17.180 --> 1:02:19.160
two days after Jacob Wheeler
was murdered.

1:02:19.220 --> 1:02:21.800
And there's more...
You have been busy.

1:02:21.860 --> 1:02:24.360
Janey and Candice's alibis
check out, however,

1:02:24.420 --> 1:02:26.200
Hamish wasn't swimming today.

1:02:26.260 --> 1:02:29.240
You have to swipe in and
there's no data recording his visit.

1:02:29.300 --> 1:02:32.520
Time we had another word
with Mr Rafferty.

1:02:32.580 --> 1:02:36.120
He wasn't in his right mind.

1:02:36.180 --> 1:02:38.720
You can see that.
No, no, no, no.

1:02:38.780 --> 1:02:40.440
I'll take full responsibility.

1:02:42.020 --> 1:02:44.240
Why did you do it, Mr Rafferty?

1:02:45.780 --> 1:02:48.160
We were dairy farmers.

1:02:48.220 --> 1:02:49.680
Happy.

1:02:49.740 --> 1:02:52.440
Prosperous...enough.

1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:55.080
Then the bottom fell out
of the market.

1:02:55.140 --> 1:02:57.240
We only just managed
to hold on to the house.

1:02:57.300 --> 1:03:02.120
I borrowed money from Michael
to start the new business.

1:03:02.180 --> 1:03:04.120
Hamish didn't know.

1:03:04.180 --> 1:03:08.280
He thought I'd inherited it
from a distant relative.

1:03:08.340 --> 1:03:11.520
Then Michael called in the loan.

1:03:11.580 --> 1:03:14.520
And we had no choice
but to pay it back.

1:03:14.580 --> 1:03:16.840
Oldest trick in the book.

1:03:16.900 --> 1:03:20.680
Staging an accident
and then claiming on the insurance.

1:03:22.020 --> 1:03:24.120
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

1:03:24.180 --> 1:03:28.200
It's called fraud, Mr Rafferty,
and a woman nearly died.

1:03:28.260 --> 1:03:30.520
And I'll never forgive myself
for that.

1:03:32.740 --> 1:03:34.560
I thought the distillery was empty.

1:03:36.420 --> 1:03:38.200
I couldn't even get that right.

1:03:43.020 --> 1:03:45.120
Look after the girl for me.

1:04:00.660 --> 1:04:02.200
Kam wants to see us.

1:04:24.700 --> 1:04:26.760
You were right to have
this analysed.

1:04:26.820 --> 1:04:28.240
It's an alloy.

1:04:28.300 --> 1:04:30.520
Approximately two, three years old.

1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:33.440
Natalie's pendant had more lustre.
Yes.

1:04:33.500 --> 1:04:35.280
Real gold doesn't react with oxygen,

1:04:35.340 --> 1:04:38.520
therefore it can never fade,
tarnish or rust with time.

1:04:38.580 --> 1:04:41.520
Jacob's pendant was
a pretty good imitation.

1:04:41.580 --> 1:04:43.960
And there's something else.

1:04:44.020 --> 1:04:49.000
Red birthmarks are skin markings
close to the surface of the skin,

1:04:49.060 --> 1:04:50.520
created by blood vessels.

1:04:50.580 --> 1:04:52.640
But when I took a sample
of this one,

1:04:52.700 --> 1:04:55.640
it tested positive
for manufactured dye.

1:04:55.700 --> 1:04:58.160
It's a tattoo?

1:04:58.220 --> 1:05:00.240
Any idea how long it's been there?

1:05:00.300 --> 1:05:04.000
From the minimal evidence of fading,
I'd say two years max.

1:05:06.420 --> 1:05:08.360
So this isn't Jacob Wheeler.

1:05:08.420 --> 1:05:10.520
We've got an impostor on our hands.

1:05:10.580 --> 1:05:13.120
But who is he?

1:05:13.180 --> 1:05:15.440
And where is the real Jacob Wheeler?

1:05:23.020 --> 1:05:27.120
I've got a DNA match on the victim
we knew as Jacob - Leon Hunt.

1:05:27.180 --> 1:05:31.480
27 years old, last known address -
a flat in South Manchester.

1:05:31.540 --> 1:05:33.360
In 2008 he served eight months

1:05:33.420 --> 1:05:35.280
for hacking
his ex-girlfriend's computer.

1:05:35.340 --> 1:05:37.680
He used to have personal details
to get into her bank account.

1:05:37.740 --> 1:05:39.040
Good work.

1:05:39.100 --> 1:05:42.800
It seems likely that the passport
in the safety deposit box

1:05:42.860 --> 1:05:44.320
belonged to Leon Hunt.

1:05:45.420 --> 1:05:48.440
But what did he stand to gain
from impersonating Jacob Wheeler?

1:05:48.500 --> 1:05:50.240
Family inheritance?

1:05:50.300 --> 1:05:53.080
I found this
in the Finchmere Parish newsletter

1:05:53.140 --> 1:05:56.000
about the parents' fatal car crash
in 2012.

1:05:57.740 --> 1:06:01.920
It says here that the parents' death
left the daughter alone

1:06:01.980 --> 1:06:05.280
after younger son ran away
from home at 14.

1:06:05.340 --> 1:06:07.400
I wonder why Natalie
didn't mention that.

1:06:07.460 --> 1:06:09.520
Perhaps to protect her brother.

1:06:09.580 --> 1:06:13.000
Maybe it doesn't tally with the way
she wants him to be remembered.

1:06:13.060 --> 1:06:14.400
Let's see what she has to say.

1:06:16.020 --> 1:06:18.560
Um, Jamie...

1:06:18.620 --> 1:06:23.480
I wanted you to be the first to know
I said yes to the job in Montreal.

1:06:23.540 --> 1:06:24.480
Oh.

1:06:26.020 --> 1:06:27.560
Right.

1:06:27.620 --> 1:06:28.920
Great.

1:06:30.140 --> 1:06:34.560
Well, if that's what you want,
then I'm really happy for you.

1:06:34.620 --> 1:06:35.920
Thanks.

1:06:35.980 --> 1:06:38.040
It should be exciting.

1:06:38.100 --> 1:06:39.160
When do you leave?

1:06:39.220 --> 1:06:42.000
Um, end of the week.

1:06:44.100 --> 1:06:45.160
Wow.

1:06:51.820 --> 1:06:53.880
I appreciate this is hard,
Miss Wheeler,

1:06:53.940 --> 1:06:58.400
but can you tell us what happened
on the day that Jacob disappeared?

1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:04.120
He was at summer camp.
Dan was there too.

1:07:05.740 --> 1:07:10.320
Jacob had some big argument with
the camp leader and ran off.

1:07:10.380 --> 1:07:12.720
Did anyone contact the police?

1:07:12.780 --> 1:07:14.400
They weren't very interested.

1:07:14.460 --> 1:07:16.040
Why was that?

1:07:16.100 --> 1:07:17.760
He had runaway so many times before.

1:07:17.820 --> 1:07:21.080
It started when we moved
from London to Finchmere.

1:07:22.460 --> 1:07:24.920
Jacob found it hard to adjust.
Missed his friends.

1:07:24.980 --> 1:07:27.000
Started bunking off.

1:07:27.060 --> 1:07:30.160
He was only interested in his music.

1:07:31.740 --> 1:07:34.720
Police said, given his history,

1:07:34.780 --> 1:07:37.800
that he probably didn't want
to be found,

1:07:37.860 --> 1:07:41.160
that he'd come back
when he was ready.

1:07:42.060 --> 1:07:46.560
And you have no idea where he went.
No.

1:07:46.620 --> 1:07:48.240
He sent some texts.

1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:49.880
Once or twice a year maybe.

1:07:50.820 --> 1:07:53.120
He just wanted me to know he was OK.

1:07:54.660 --> 1:07:57.160
After a while, he stopped.

1:07:57.220 --> 1:07:59.360
We'll need to take a look
at those texts.

1:07:59.420 --> 1:08:02.600
So how did he reappear?

1:08:02.660 --> 1:08:05.520
I was playing in Dublin
a couple of years ago.

1:08:05.580 --> 1:08:07.120
He was in another orchestra.

1:08:08.100 --> 1:08:11.200
And then, suddenly, there he was.

1:08:11.260 --> 1:08:13.720
And did you never doubt
that it was your brother?

1:08:13.780 --> 1:08:16.080
No, it had to be him.

1:08:17.380 --> 1:08:19.600
He had the same birthmark.

1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:21.280
His St Christopher.

1:08:21.340 --> 1:08:24.240
And he knew so much
about the family,

1:08:24.300 --> 1:08:25.960
things that only Jacob could know.

1:08:26.020 --> 1:08:27.920
Leon Hunt was a highly-skilled
computer hacker.

1:08:27.980 --> 1:08:29.480
We suspect that he hacked to yours.

1:08:29.540 --> 1:08:31.280
No doubt there's all kinds
of information

1:08:31.340 --> 1:08:32.480
about you and Jacob on there.

1:08:32.540 --> 1:08:34.960
But he did a DNA test.

1:08:35.020 --> 1:08:37.960
The lawyers made him
for my parents inheritance.

1:08:38.020 --> 1:08:39.360
Well, with his expertise,

1:08:39.420 --> 1:08:41.200
it wouldn't be very difficult
to fake.

1:08:42.140 --> 1:08:43.640
If this is all true...

1:08:44.900 --> 1:08:47.280
..Jacob's still missing.

1:08:47.340 --> 1:08:49.800
You've got to hold me find him.

1:08:49.860 --> 1:08:52.880
I think you need a minute
just to take it all in.

1:08:52.940 --> 1:08:56.480
Mr Falconer, what can you tell us
about this summer camp?

1:08:56.540 --> 1:08:58.080
Um...

1:08:58.140 --> 1:09:00.160
All the local villages took part.

1:09:00.220 --> 1:09:02.160
It's where I met Jacob.

1:09:02.220 --> 1:09:04.360
When was the last time you saw him?

1:09:04.420 --> 1:09:06.120
It was on the Sunday
when he ran away,

1:09:06.180 --> 1:09:07.880
getting on the bus to Millminster.

1:09:07.940 --> 1:09:10.400
Do you remember what time this was?

1:09:10.460 --> 1:09:14.360
Must have been late afternoon,
about six.

1:09:14.420 --> 1:09:16.680
And do you know what it was
that he was arguing about

1:09:16.740 --> 1:09:19.760
with the camp leader before he left?

1:09:19.820 --> 1:09:22.720
Jacob had nicked
Audrey's cigarettes.

1:09:22.780 --> 1:09:24.240
We thought it was really funny.

1:09:24.300 --> 1:09:25.600
Even Ivo Baxter.

1:09:25.660 --> 1:09:28.560
But she caught him
handing them round.

1:09:28.620 --> 1:09:29.920
She went crazy.

1:09:29.980 --> 1:09:32.880
They had this big argument
and then he just walked.

1:09:32.940 --> 1:09:36.120
Audrey?
Yeah, the camp leader.

1:09:36.180 --> 1:09:37.560
Audrey Glenhill.

1:09:37.620 --> 1:09:40.000
She runs the Thassingham Arms.

1:09:51.500 --> 1:09:52.560
Where have you been?

1:09:52.620 --> 1:09:54.000
I had to make sure
I wasn't followed.

1:09:54.060 --> 1:09:55.760
Come on. Let's get this done
and get out of here.

1:10:02.020 --> 1:10:05.520
Should be open by now.
She's not picking up any calls.

1:10:05.580 --> 1:10:09.640
Let's triangulate her phone.
See if we can track her down.

1:10:09.700 --> 1:10:12.640
In the meantime,
let's see what Ivo Baxter has to say

1:10:12.700 --> 1:10:15.440
about the last time he saw
the real Jacob Wheeler.

1:10:18.300 --> 1:10:20.840
Hello? Mr Baxter?

1:10:35.660 --> 1:10:39.080
Ah, I thought Marjorie was in here.

1:10:39.140 --> 1:10:40.880
Didn't mean to startle you,
Mr Baxter.

1:10:40.940 --> 1:10:42.480
We just wanted to ask
a few questions.

1:10:43.820 --> 1:10:47.120
Well, should we go up to the shop?
It's much warmer there.

1:10:47.180 --> 1:10:48.360
Here's fine.

1:10:49.260 --> 1:10:51.520
You've got some lovely instruments,
Mr Baxter.

1:10:52.460 --> 1:10:55.240
Nothing of note,
if you excuse the pun.

1:10:55.300 --> 1:10:58.000
I doubt that very much.

1:10:58.060 --> 1:11:00.240
I'm rather curious about this stain.

1:11:02.220 --> 1:11:04.960
Did you know that violinists used
to use it to cover

1:11:05.020 --> 1:11:06.400
the grey in their hair.

1:11:06.460 --> 1:11:08.280
Must have made a terrible mess.

1:11:08.340 --> 1:11:12.840
Surely a stain like this could
also be used to darken

1:11:12.900 --> 1:11:16.040
the distinctive red colour
of a Stradivarius...

1:11:16.100 --> 1:11:18.880
..if you wanted to disguise it.

1:11:18.940 --> 1:11:21.320
May I take a look at that case,
Mr Baxter?

1:11:38.060 --> 1:11:40.960
I didn't see it as an act
of stealing,

1:11:41.020 --> 1:11:43.720
more of an act of mercy.

1:11:44.740 --> 1:11:48.400
Jacob didn't deserve to play such
a rare and beautiful instrument.

1:11:48.460 --> 1:11:51.800
He could never have loved it
as I would have loved it.

1:11:51.860 --> 1:11:55.560
So when he was murdered,
I knew I had to rescue it.

1:11:55.620 --> 1:11:59.840
When did you last see Jacob
before he ran away?

1:11:59.900 --> 1:12:02.200
Uh, at youth camp.

1:12:02.260 --> 1:12:04.440
He was smoking. Offered me one.

1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:05.680
I didn't take it.

1:12:05.740 --> 1:12:07.120
Sir.

1:12:11.500 --> 1:12:15.600
Any idea what might be on this,
Mr Baxter?

1:12:15.660 --> 1:12:17.520
I've never seen it before
in my life.

1:12:22.100 --> 1:12:25.120
From Ivo's reaction, I reckon
he could be telling the truth.

1:12:25.180 --> 1:12:28.640
I'm reserving judgement until
we know what's on that memory stick.

1:12:28.700 --> 1:12:30.840
Tech could take some time.
The file's encrypted.

Hold on, Sir.

1:12:33.380 --> 1:12:36.640
Triangulation puts Audrey's phone
somewhere here.

1:12:36.700 --> 1:12:40.320
Let's see what she remembers
about the day Jacob ran away.

1:12:46.380 --> 1:12:47.720
Aha.

1:12:50.020 --> 1:12:52.280
That's it.
Told you it would be alright.

1:12:52.340 --> 1:12:54.840
OK.
Mr Sowande...

1:12:54.900 --> 1:12:57.240
Would you mind opening
those doors for me?

1:13:06.820 --> 1:13:07.920

1:13:14.220 --> 1:13:15.680
It was my idea.

1:13:16.580 --> 1:13:19.200
Warwick had lost his job.
He needed the money.

1:13:19.260 --> 1:13:22.640
The Raffertys were to blame.
It felt like divine justice.

1:13:22.700 --> 1:13:24.920
So we just helped ourselves.

1:13:24.980 --> 1:13:26.840
Found a dealer who'd take it.

1:13:28.460 --> 1:13:32.000
You were a youth leader here,
I understand.

1:13:32.060 --> 1:13:33.680
Yeah, that's right.

1:13:33.740 --> 1:13:35.560
That's how I knew about the hut.

1:13:35.620 --> 1:13:38.720
No-one uses it any more
so it's the perfect hiding place.

1:13:38.780 --> 1:13:42.440
You were in charge on the day
that Jacob Wheeler ran away.

1:13:42.500 --> 1:13:45.560
Dan Falconer, said that Jacob was
in trouble for stealing cigarettes.

1:13:45.620 --> 1:13:48.000
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

1:13:48.060 --> 1:13:49.920
Boys were always smoking
down in the tunnels.

1:13:49.980 --> 1:13:52.400
The tunnels?
Yeah.

1:13:52.460 --> 1:13:54.800
It's a rabbit warren under here.

1:13:54.860 --> 1:13:56.000
Dangerous.

1:13:57.860 --> 1:13:59.880
(CLEARS THROAT)

1:13:59.940 --> 1:14:01.280
We couldn't keep a check on them.

1:14:01.340 --> 1:14:03.360
Even when they'd bricked up
all the entrances,

1:14:03.420 --> 1:14:04.800
they would always find
a new way in there.

1:14:04.860 --> 1:14:07.360
That's why we moved the camp
to Badger's Drift.

1:14:13.220 --> 1:14:14.600
Stay there.

1:14:20.660 --> 1:14:24.560
Dan Falconer said he last saw Jacob
getting on the bus to Millminster

1:14:24.620 --> 1:14:26.720
at around 6pm that Sunday.

1:14:26.780 --> 1:14:28.000
That's right.

1:14:28.060 --> 1:14:30.120
Are you sure about that?

1:14:30.180 --> 1:14:32.960
I could be wrong but there was never
normally a bus

1:14:33.020 --> 1:14:34.600
after 3pm on a Sunday.

1:14:49.020 --> 1:14:50.480
Sir.

1:14:50.540 --> 1:14:52.160
I think should take a look at this.

1:14:57.780 --> 1:15:00.160
Seems to go on for some distance,
Sir.

1:15:04.740 --> 1:15:06.200

1:15:06.260 --> 1:15:08.360
Tell her we need an excavation team.

1:15:12.140 --> 1:15:15.240
We need to have another talk
with Dan Falconer.

1:15:15.300 --> 1:15:17.920
His story about Jacob Wheeler doesn't
tie up with the others.

1:15:17.980 --> 1:15:20.240
You might want to speak
to his father Michael first.

1:15:20.300 --> 1:15:22.920
Tech have just sent me through
the files from the memory stick.

1:15:22.980 --> 1:15:24.880
They'll both be at the concert
by now.

1:15:25.860 --> 1:15:27.480
You must play without fear.

1:15:29.020 --> 1:15:31.760
Play from the depth of your soul.

1:15:31.820 --> 1:15:35.320
Together we will fly in the face
of the curse.

1:15:36.420 --> 1:15:37.760
Thank you.

Oh, Dan...

Mr Falconer.

1:16:07.660 --> 1:16:09.000
Chief Inspector.

1:16:10.180 --> 1:16:13.160
Dan told me
about Jacob being an impostor.

1:16:13.220 --> 1:16:14.720
Extraordinary.

1:16:14.780 --> 1:16:17.240
But I'm afraid
I don't have time for that now.

1:16:17.300 --> 1:16:19.240
I think you do.

1:16:21.060 --> 1:16:22.800
Excuse me.

1:16:26.180 --> 1:16:29.800
We found the Stradivarius
in Ivo Baxter's workshop.

1:16:29.860 --> 1:16:32.960
There was a USB stick
in one of the compartments.

1:16:33.020 --> 1:16:35.040
On it were confidential
medical notes

1:16:35.100 --> 1:16:37.440
relating to the radical treatment
you're about to undergo

1:16:37.500 --> 1:16:38.840
to save your hearing.

1:16:38.900 --> 1:16:42.920
Why would the man you knew as
Jacob Wheeler have that information

1:16:42.980 --> 1:16:45.360
in an encrypted file?

1:16:47.260 --> 1:16:50.040
Because he was trying
to blackmail me.

1:16:50.100 --> 1:16:52.400
He found out I was going deaf.

1:16:52.460 --> 1:16:55.440
He said my career would be over
if the truth came out.

1:16:55.500 --> 1:16:58.640
Hence the need to call in the loan
to your sister

1:16:58.700 --> 1:17:02.760
to pay for your treatment
and for Jacob's blackmail.

1:17:02.820 --> 1:17:04.440
No, I refused to pay.

1:17:06.020 --> 1:17:08.600
When I tried to fire him,
he threatened to go to the press.

1:17:08.660 --> 1:17:10.280
And then he rigged the voting system

1:17:10.340 --> 1:17:12.120
to make sure that
he won the award money

1:17:12.180 --> 1:17:13.600
and I felt
that I couldn't say anything.

1:17:13.660 --> 1:17:15.840
You could have said no.

I don't think you know

1:17:18.340 --> 1:17:20.440
how precarious our festival here is.

Music has been my entire life.

1:17:25.020 --> 1:17:28.280

I'm not sure I'd want to carry on.

Jacob never left the camp,
did he, Mr Falconer?

1:20:22.700 --> 1:20:24.440
You told us he got on a bus
to Millminster

1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:26.720
but we know there was no service
after 3pm.

1:20:26.780 --> 1:20:30.120
Why would you lie
if it wasn't to conceal the fact

1:20:30.180 --> 1:20:31.440
that he never left at all?

A celebration of death.

1:22:57.740 --> 1:22:59.880
I wanted to believe it was him.

1:23:02.020 --> 1:23:04.360
My Jacob.

1:23:04.420 --> 1:23:06.720
He seemed different somehow.

1:23:07.860 --> 1:23:09.480
But it had been such a long time.

1:23:13.340 --> 1:23:15.880
Then I found a flight booking
in his real name...

1:23:17.500 --> 1:23:20.040
..on a phone I'd never seen before.

1:23:24.060 --> 1:23:27.640
I confronted him
the first night of the festival.

1:23:27.700 --> 1:23:32.280
He was planning to leave
once he'd got the inheritance money.

1:23:32.340 --> 1:23:33.640
Jacob's money.

1:23:35.340 --> 1:23:37.640
I told him
I was going to the police.

1:23:39.900 --> 1:23:41.680
He was so horrid.

1:23:42.820 --> 1:23:45.120
He said how easy it was,

1:23:45.180 --> 1:23:48.040
how stupid I'd been...

1:23:49.020 --> 1:23:51.080
..and that he'd kill me
if I told anyone.

1:23:55.340 --> 1:23:56.680
I believed him.

1:23:56.740 --> 1:23:59.160
So you strangled him.

1:24:00.860 --> 1:24:02.400
He deserved it.

1:24:07.140 --> 1:24:10.240
And then there was Vernon De Harthog.

1:24:10.300 --> 1:24:14.280
We know that he found
Leon's passport.

1:24:14.340 --> 1:24:18.080
He came to see me,
told me everything he'd discovered.

1:24:19.460 --> 1:24:22.040
Thrilled by the drama of it all.

1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:24.920
And you were afraid that
Vernon's revelation would lead us

1:24:24.980 --> 1:24:29.840
straight to you, so you moved
quickly to keep him quiet.

1:24:29.900 --> 1:24:32.400
Your friendship
with Candice Rafferty

1:24:32.460 --> 1:24:35.120
gave you access to the strychnine.

1:24:35.180 --> 1:24:36.840
Poor Vernon.

1:24:42.500 --> 1:24:46.560
I'd waited so long
for Jacob to come home...

1:24:49.300 --> 1:24:51.760
Natalie, I know I don't deserve
your forgiveness...

1:24:51.820 --> 1:24:53.440
No, you don't!

1:24:53.500 --> 1:24:55.000
(SOBS)

1:24:58.660 --> 1:25:01.520
It's time to go, Miss Wheeler.

1:25:01.580 --> 1:25:03.880
Can you take me to see my brother?

1:25:05.900 --> 1:25:07.400
Please.

1:26:07.620 --> 1:26:11.240
I know I shouldn't but I can't help
feeling sorry for her.

1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:16.400
Life's all about the decisions
we make, good or bad.

1:26:17.500 --> 1:26:19.560
I think you're making
the right one by the way.

1:26:19.620 --> 1:26:21.640
Happy to get rid of me, then?

1:26:21.700 --> 1:26:24.560
(CHUCKLES) Quite the opposite.
You've done amazing work here.

1:26:24.620 --> 1:26:26.360
You'll be hard to replace.

1:26:27.740 --> 1:26:29.680
We're all going to miss you.

1:26:29.740 --> 1:26:30.520
Aren't we, Winter?

1:26:30.580 --> 1:26:31.520
Yeah.

1:26:35.100 --> 1:26:36.760
Yeah, we are.

1:26:38.540 --> 1:26:40.120
(CLEARS THROAT)

1:26:40.180 --> 1:26:41.360
Stay away from the bears.

1:26:42.780 --> 1:26:44.920
I'll remember that.

1:26:58.540 --> 1:27:02.080
Da-da-dun! For you, Betty.

1:27:02.140 --> 1:27:03.640
(LAUGHS)

1:27:05.020 --> 1:27:07.520
That's lovely.
Jamie, that's so sweet of you.

1:27:07.580 --> 1:27:09.440
You won't be saying that
when she's playing it

1:27:09.500 --> 1:27:10.840
at six o'clock in the morning.

1:27:10.900 --> 1:27:13.280
And for you. Congratulations.

1:27:13.340 --> 1:27:14.320
Oh, thank you!

1:27:14.380 --> 1:27:15.800
I hear you have a publisher
interested.

1:27:15.860 --> 1:27:17.360
Can I read it?
Oh, no chance.

1:27:17.420 --> 1:27:19.920
She won't even let me.
I'm too clever apparently.

1:27:19.980 --> 1:27:21.160
And modest.

1:27:21.220 --> 1:27:23.920
(PHONE BLEEPS)

1:27:23.980 --> 1:27:25.680
It's Kam.

1:27:25.740 --> 1:27:27.680
She's landed.

1:27:27.740 --> 1:27:29.240
Oh, I hope she has a great time.

1:27:29.300 --> 1:27:30.920
Yeah, they're very lucky
to have her.

1:27:30.980 --> 1:27:33.160
(PLAYS NOTE)

1:27:33.220 --> 1:27:35.200
Well done, Betty!

1:27:35.260 --> 1:27:37.200
She's a natural!

1:27:37.260 --> 1:27:40.920
So will I still be invited over to
lunch when you're rich and famous?

1:27:40.980 --> 1:27:43.400
You're welcome here any time, Jamie.

1:27:43.460 --> 1:27:47.080
With your bestseller
and Betty's musical prowess,

1:27:47.140 --> 1:27:48.960
looks like I'll be taking
early retirement.

1:27:49.020 --> 1:27:50.120
Oh, don't do that.

1:27:50.180 --> 1:27:52.040
I'm only just getting used
to your funny ways.

1:27:52.100 --> 1:27:53.360
(CHUCKLES)

1:27:53.420 --> 1:27:55.120
Cheers.
