WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:06.250
Previously on Legacies...If I return the knife to
Malivore, I will be free.What's Malivore?

00:06.250 --> 00:08.830
It's a hell dimension
that consumes creatures

00:08.830 --> 00:11.080
and wipes their existence
from the collective conscience.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.750
ALARIC:Yesterday I came
into possession

00:12.750 --> 00:14.410
of another Malivore artifact.

00:14.410 --> 00:16.750
Now monsters
that shouldn't exist

00:16.750 --> 00:18.330
have been coming after it.

00:18.330 --> 00:19.910
How long do you think it'll be

00:19.910 --> 00:21.330
before the next monster
shows up?

00:21.330 --> 00:22.700
Do you think I'm broken?
Of course not.

00:22.700 --> 00:25.450
I think your
biological mother's

00:25.450 --> 00:26.830
crazy-ass witch ancestors
left you

00:26.830 --> 00:28.910
with a legacy of darkness
that you have to work through.

00:28.910 --> 00:31.250
I don't ever want
to hurt anybody.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.910
I'm here now to help.

00:32.910 --> 00:34.410
LIZZIE: I'm surprised
that you have time

00:34.410 --> 00:35.700
with all of the private
training sessions

00:35.700 --> 00:37.410
you've been doing
with Hope Mikaelson.

00:37.410 --> 00:39.410
Speak of the actual devil.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.540
You sure it glowed again?

00:45.500 --> 00:47.330
I sleep with the damn
thing under my pillow..

00:47.330 --> 00:49.160
It's hard to miss.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.580
What do you think
it's gonna be this time?

00:50.580 --> 00:52.910
Hmm? Cyclops?

00:52.910 --> 00:54.080
Slender Man? Santa?

00:54.080 --> 00:56.700
(chuckles) Well, given our luck,
I think it's safe

00:56.700 --> 00:58.330
to rule out Ol' Saint Nick.
I don't know.

00:58.330 --> 01:00.500
I mean, Santa Claus
is kind of terrifying

01:00.500 --> 01:02.080
when you think about it.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.250
Breaks into your home.

01:03.250 --> 01:04.500
He sees you
when you're sleeping.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.000
Not to mention, judge-y.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.540
Hope, I need you to focus.
Look, I'm trying.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.410
I just wish
that Satan's nightlight

01:09.410 --> 01:10.660
would give us some rest.
Yeah.

01:10.660 --> 01:12.450
And I wish that knife was never
in our school to begin with,

01:12.450 --> 01:14.830
but it's not like
we can change that now.

01:14.830 --> 01:16.830
All we can do is make sure
we're not blindsided

01:16.830 --> 01:18.620
by another monster
waltzing through our doors.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.830
(laughs)

01:20.830 --> 01:22.370
Too late.

01:24.580 --> 01:25.580
Oh, God.

01:25.580 --> 01:27.830
Uh, girls.
What are you doing here?You're not supposed
to get in until tonight.

01:27.830 --> 01:29.580
Mom was able to get
us direct into Dulles.

01:29.580 --> 01:31.660
Then faxed, texted
and e-mailed you

01:31.660 --> 01:34.790
our revised itinerary.
ALARIC:
I am so sorry.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.500
It's-it's chaos around here.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.370
It's okay, Dad.

01:38.370 --> 01:40.580
We know that you're overwhelmed.

01:40.580 --> 01:42.450
But Europe was amazing.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.330
And seeing Mom
was really good.

01:44.330 --> 01:46.330
LIZZIE:
Jo's covered
the bright side.

01:46.330 --> 01:47.580
Far less sunny
was waiting for you

01:47.580 --> 01:49.370
in the chilly dark of
morning at the terminal

01:49.370 --> 01:51.040
and you not showing up.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.370
In his defense,

01:53.370 --> 01:55.290
um, we've been
in crisis mode around here.

01:55.290 --> 01:57.450
Oh, we've heard all about it.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.830
Hope got bamboozled
by one of the monsters

01:58.830 --> 02:01.660
and now only two keys separate

02:01.660 --> 02:03.250
the entire
supernatural community

02:03.250 --> 02:04.700
from being consumed
by a hell portal.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.750
I'm guessing that weird
little vase is one of them?

02:06.750 --> 02:09.540
It's an urn, actually.

02:09.540 --> 02:11.370
I don't care what it is.

02:11.370 --> 02:12.830
I care that instead of being
welcomed at the airport,

02:12.830 --> 02:15.950
we were forced to take

02:15.950 --> 02:17.790
a three-hour shuttle ride
that smelled like an open sewer.

02:18.080 --> 02:21.290
And feet.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.080
Thanks a lot, Hope.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.450
Way to ruin life
for the rest of us.

02:29.290 --> 02:29.750
Breathe.

02:33.290 --> 02:34.950
Just breathe.

02:34.950 --> 02:36.370
Come on, you beautiful beast.

02:36.370 --> 02:39.950
Say the magic words.

02:39.950 --> 02:41.700
I wish Hope had never come
to this school.

02:43.620 --> 02:46.500
(shrieks)

02:47.700 --> 02:49.370
Where did you come from?

02:50.450 --> 02:51.830
Mm. First things
first. I'm...
Blue.

02:51.830 --> 02:54.330
Y-You're so blue.

02:54.330 --> 02:56.290
My name is Ablah.

02:56.290 --> 02:58.620
And you're obviously a monster.

02:58.620 --> 03:00.290
Would a monster grant your wish?

03:00.290 --> 03:03.080
Holy crap.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.580
You're a freaking genie.

03:06.910 --> 03:09.040
Hmm. Jinni.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.950
And your wish is my command.

03:19.790 --> 03:24.040
(knocking on door)

03:24.040 --> 03:27.000
ALARIC:
Elizabeth.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.330
(door opening)

03:28.330 --> 03:30.250
Rise and shine.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.580
What, you taking
the day off, Lizzie B?

03:32.580 --> 03:34.330
Dad, what time is it?
I had the weirdest dre...

03:34.330 --> 03:37.290
What happened to your face?

03:38.660 --> 03:41.450
Quit stalling.

03:41.450 --> 03:43.120
It's time...
for fight training.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.250
Pass.
I'm not really in the mood

03:45.250 --> 03:47.950
to watch Hope
be a ninja today, Dad.

03:47.950 --> 03:50.370
(chuckling):
Who?

03:52.200 --> 03:52.620
Never mind.

03:56.330 --> 03:58.450
All right. Well, come on.
Josie's down at the dock.

03:58.450 --> 04:01.370
(grunting)

04:01.370 --> 04:03.790
Come on. Let's go.

04:03.790 --> 04:05.120
Get out of bed.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.370

Quit bragging.
You're losing.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.080
Lizzie, go high.

(grunts)

04:26.080 --> 04:27.620

04:31.120 --> 04:32.500
Help your old man up.

04:34.250 --> 04:36.450

Oh, yeah.

04:38.750 --> 04:42.120
Our years of training
have really paid off.LIZZIE:
So, there's, like,

04:42.120 --> 04:43.700
no one else you'd rather
be training with?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.410
Well, who else would there be?
(chuckles)

04:46.410 --> 04:48.790
Now go get dressed. You're
giving a tour in ten minutes,

04:48.790 --> 04:50.790
and I really need you to sell
the new recruit on our place.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.330
He's not sure he wants
to go here.

04:53.330 --> 04:55.450
Who wouldn't want
to go here?

04:55.450 --> 04:57.120
Exactly.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.450
We'll reel him in, Dad.
Don't worry.

04:58.450 --> 04:59.750
What would I do
without you guys?

04:59.750 --> 05:04.160
LIZZIE:
Welcome to
the Salvatore School.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.910
We're your tour guides.

05:05.910 --> 05:07.000
I'm Josie.
I'm Lizzie.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.950
Sisters.
Twins.

05:08.950 --> 05:10.830
Fraternal, obvs.

05:10.830 --> 05:12.120
Come on.
We'll show you around.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.830
Everybody gets along
with everybody here.

05:13.830 --> 05:15.620
For the most part.(door closing)

05:15.620 --> 05:17.160
The wolves are
pretty cliquey.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.750
They mostly like to hang
with their... Oh.

05:21.620 --> 05:23.910
(wind whistling)

05:25.790 --> 05:27.330
This place is a turd stain.

05:27.330 --> 05:28.910
Uh.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.160
The maintenance staff must be
on holiday or something.

05:32.160 --> 05:35.290
Um...

05:35.290 --> 05:37.330
Why don't we introduce you
to your pack?

05:37.330 --> 05:39.500
Okay.

05:40.330 --> 05:41.370
Where's the pack?

05:41.370 --> 05:43.000
(laughs softly)

05:43.000 --> 05:44.620
LUIS:
Hey, Jed.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.000
I'm Luis.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.540
Uh...

05:48.540 --> 05:50.660
Your alpha.

05:51.910 --> 05:52.830
(sighs)

05:55.910 --> 05:57.700
(indistinct chatter nearby)

05:57.700 --> 05:59.370
Do you think
he'll stay?

05:59.370 --> 06:01.500
It's so hard to
get anyone to stay.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.330
Well, if these are
the breakfast offerings,

06:03.330 --> 06:06.080
it's no wonder.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.160
Where are the pastries?

06:07.160 --> 06:08.830
The Belgian waffles?

06:08.830 --> 06:10.000
The smoothie station?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
(laughing):
Right.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.700
I'll tell Dad to add
that to the budget

06:13.700 --> 06:15.660
after he pays
the gas bill.

06:15.660 --> 06:18.000
Wait. (laughs)

06:18.000 --> 06:20.040
Are we... poor?

06:20.040 --> 06:22.700
Lizzie, you know how expensive
it is to run this place,

06:22.700 --> 06:26.830
how hard it is
to get benefactors.

06:26.830 --> 06:28.580
I mean, Damon Salvatore has been

06:28.580 --> 06:31.500
as generous as he can be,
but he and Elena

06:31.500 --> 06:33.080
have kids of their own
that they need to take care of.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.580
I'm gonna make
sure that Dad eats.

06:35.580 --> 06:38.080
He works so hard.

06:38.620 --> 06:40.540
Oh, crap.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.830
(exhales)

06:45.830 --> 06:47.870
Genie?

06:49.080 --> 06:51.040
Genie.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.370
Is she, like, uh,
talking to herself?

06:53.700 --> 06:55.870
Genie.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.750
The Saltzman twins
are blazing hot.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.410
But the blonde
one es muy loco.

07:01.410 --> 07:04.660
JED:
Huh.

07:04.660 --> 07:06.120
Genie.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.000
Yeah?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.200
This place sucks.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.080
Hope's dad wrote my mom
a big check

07:13.250 --> 07:15.830
to fund the school
when it opened,

07:15.830 --> 07:17.500
so no Hope,
no funding, no fun.

07:17.870 --> 07:21.870
Fix it.

07:21.870 --> 07:25.080
Oh, is that to be
your next wish? Yes, that will be my-- Wait.

07:25.080 --> 07:28.540
I know how this goes.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.000
I waste my first wish

07:30.000 --> 07:31.330
by not being specific enough.

07:31.330 --> 07:32.830
I waste my second one
trying to clean up my first,

07:32.830 --> 07:35.950
only to make things worse,

07:35.950 --> 07:37.250
and then my third gets wasted

07:37.250 --> 07:39.160
by wishing that I had never had
any wishes in the first place.

07:39.160 --> 07:42.660
I won't fall for it, Genie.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.540
(clears throat) It's Jinni.
That's what I said.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.500
I'll beat you
at your own game.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.700
Make the best of this rat trap.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.950
Send me back in.

07:51.950 --> 07:54.000
ALARIC (sighs):
I know, Caroline.

07:56.660 --> 07:59.160
I am sorry I sent you on
a fool's errand to Idaho,

07:59.160 --> 08:02.660
but this is an
inexact science

08:02.660 --> 08:04.120
and we only have
so much to go on.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.500
We'll find new recruits,
I promise.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.330
LIZZIE:
This is how
we find new recruits?

08:12.830 --> 08:15.330
Why are you acting
so weird today?

08:15.330 --> 08:16.750
Well, no wonder
our school is lame.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.620
But fear not, family.

08:21.910 --> 08:24.580
I know how to help.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.830
Where did you get that?

08:29.080 --> 08:31.000
In the archive room.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.330
We don't have
an archive room.

08:32.330 --> 08:33.830
Well, now it's more of just
like a storage closet,

08:33.830 --> 08:36.660
but no matter.

08:36.660 --> 08:38.080
This is the solution

08:38.080 --> 08:40.120
to all of our
recruiting problems.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.790
It's like a locator spell,
only it's interactive.

08:41.790 --> 08:45.120
The instant a new, young,

08:45.120 --> 08:46.870
supernatural being
is awakened to their powers,

08:46.870 --> 08:49.410
this bad boy lights up.

08:49.410 --> 08:50.790
ALARIC:
That's incredible.

08:50.790 --> 08:52.370
H-How do you know
how to do this?

08:52.370 --> 08:53.700
An annoying,
know-it-all witch I knew

08:53.700 --> 08:55.660
in another life created it,
so I just copied her spell.

08:55.830 --> 08:59.870
Go ahead.

08:59.870 --> 09:00.910
Give it a spin.

09:05.950 --> 09:09.950
(sighs)

09:10.830 --> 09:12.790
There's so many of them.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.120
All waiting for us to come
to their rescue, Daddy.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.410
Oh, well, there...

09:19.410 --> 09:21.750
The bigger the glow,
the more powerful the being.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.950
Well, then we need to bring
this one in immediately.

09:24.950 --> 09:27.540
Yeah, it's huge.
Where is that?

09:27.540 --> 09:28.950
New Orleans.

09:31.750 --> 09:33.160
(jazz music playing)

09:38.040 --> 09:42.370
(jazz music continues)

09:49.750 --> 09:54.160
(trumpet music sputtering)

09:54.700 --> 09:55.910
(head rolling)

10:00.040 --> 10:00.870
Gross.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.290
(liquid spurting,
chomping sounds)

10:08.040 --> 10:12.040
You have got to be kidding me.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.040
Who the hell are you?

10:14.040 --> 10:16.120
Uh-uh. Time out, Genie.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.370
My name is Hope.

10:18.370 --> 10:20.200
And you need to leave
unless you want to be dessert.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.290
ALARIC:
Wait.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.790
Hope Mikaelson?

10:27.330 --> 10:28.870
I knew your parents.

10:28.870 --> 10:30.870
I know where all this darkness
you're feeling comes from.

10:31.580 --> 10:33.950
If you just talk
to me, I...

10:36.040 --> 10:38.120
really think I could help.

10:45.910 --> 10:50.330
You really saved the day.

10:50.330 --> 10:52.700
Look at him.

10:52.700 --> 10:53.540
He just looks so happy.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.370
Yay, me.

10:55.370 --> 10:56.660
And we have a couple
of tours later today.

10:56.660 --> 10:58.870
Now that we have a tribrid,
we're in the game for real.

11:01.290 --> 11:01.950
(grunting)

11:08.000 --> 11:10.420
You belong here, Hope.

11:11.710 --> 11:13.040
This could be your home.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.580
The family you lost.

11:14.580 --> 11:15.920
I can't stay.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.250
I've done so many
awful things.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.960
(grunting)

11:21.790 --> 11:23.540
(panting): That's because no one
was there to guide you.

11:23.540 --> 11:27.540
I don't blame you, Hope.

11:27.540 --> 11:29.210
I should have found you sooner.

11:37.420 --> 11:39.500
(exhales)

11:41.500 --> 11:43.630
Oh...

11:43.630 --> 11:44.880
screw this.

11:44.880 --> 11:49.080
Genie?

11:49.920 --> 11:51.420
Jinni. J-I-

11:51.420 --> 11:53.130
N-N, adding "I" at the end...

11:53.130 --> 11:55.210
To sound exactly like "Genie."

11:55.210 --> 11:57.170
Now, tell me something.
Are all J-I-N-N-Is

11:57.170 --> 11:59.330
this terrible at their jobs,

11:59.330 --> 12:01.750
or did you completely
miss the part

12:01.750 --> 12:03.500
where I wished
for Hopenotto go here?

12:03.500 --> 12:05.670
"I wish Hope had never
come to this school,"

12:05.670 --> 12:08.250
and she hadn't--
until today.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.670
Fascinating that your father's
dream couldn't be realized

12:10.670 --> 12:13.790
without her presence, isn't it?

12:13.790 --> 12:17.210
Go back inside your lamp.

12:17.210 --> 12:19.330
You must choose your
words carefully.

12:19.330 --> 12:22.250
Precision is key.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.670
I can only grant
what it is you wish for, so...

12:23.670 --> 12:27.500
you should figure out exactly
what your heart desires,

12:27.500 --> 12:30.420
or, in your case,
what it does not.

12:30.420 --> 12:32.580
Well...

12:32.580 --> 12:35.580
what my heart
doesnotdesire is Hope always showing up here
to be my dad's pet.

12:35.580 --> 12:38.330
So...

12:38.330 --> 12:39.880
I wish...

12:39.880 --> 12:41.380
that there was never a Salvatore
School to begin with.

12:41.380 --> 12:45.540
Your wish is my command.

12:48.420 --> 12:53.380
Now, remember,
if anybody starts
messing with you,

12:53.380 --> 12:55.460
just play it cool.

12:55.460 --> 12:56.580
JOSIE:
Don't worry, Dad. We know.

12:56.580 --> 12:58.380
No magic allowed.
Blah, blah, blah.

12:58.380 --> 13:00.420
Public school. Makes sense.

13:00.420 --> 13:02.540
All right, well, I hate
to sound like a broken record,

13:02.540 --> 13:06.040
but if you expose
your powers...

13:06.040 --> 13:08.040
You risk becoming a target.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.040
All right, girls,

13:10.040 --> 13:11.540
we'll see you in class.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.040
LIZZIE:
Wait.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.330
Why am I in the back seat?

13:24.250 --> 13:28.880
CHEERLEADERS:
Defense! Defense!

13:28.880 --> 13:32.330
So, do we
like it here?
Where?

13:32.330 --> 13:34.710
This school.

13:34.710 --> 13:36.790
Lizzie, do me a favor

13:36.790 --> 13:39.080
and try to keep it together
today, okay?

13:39.080 --> 13:40.960
It's important.
Okay.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.580
Homecoming queen!

13:42.580 --> 13:43.880
Big night.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.710
Thanks.
Thanks.

13:45.710 --> 13:47.380
That wasn't an
invitation, Connor.

13:50.460 --> 13:52.500
And that is
inappropriate.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.420
Your sister's
being weird again.
Cut her some slack.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.040
It's hard being the only one
on Homecoming without a date.

13:59.040 --> 14:02.250
LIZZIE: Wait.
I don't have a date?

14:02.250 --> 14:04.710
I can't wait

14:04.710 --> 14:06.000
to see what you
have planned for tonight.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.040
I'm pretty sure
you're gonna like it.

14:09.630 --> 14:11.170
(softly):
Ooh.

14:13.830 --> 14:15.040
(giggles)

14:15.040 --> 14:16.380
Hmm.

14:16.380 --> 14:17.210
I am so
confused.

14:17.210 --> 14:20.380
You're into Connor?
Lizzie,

14:20.380 --> 14:22.170
we talked about this.

14:22.170 --> 14:23.830
He's QB1.
I'm head cheer.

14:23.830 --> 14:26.000
It just makes sense.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.330
DANA: Here's your
skinny vanilla latte.

14:27.330 --> 14:29.500
Not now, Dana.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.250
My sister is obviously on drugs,
and I despise vanilla latte.

14:32.250 --> 14:35.880
Thanks, D.
Mm.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.080
Somebody's clearly having
one of her off days.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.710
Lizzie-Bear, relax.

14:40.710 --> 14:42.040
There's only

14:42.040 --> 14:43.880
so much a doctor
can raise your dosage

14:43.880 --> 14:45.580
before my mom's pharmacy
will plumb run out of pills.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.130
Come on.

14:51.460 --> 14:52.630
(school bell rings)

14:54.580 --> 14:58.670
ALARIC:
Those who don't learn
from historyare doomed to repeat it.

14:58.670 --> 15:00.250
And the truth is,
those 27 civilians,

15:00.250 --> 15:02.880
they weren't...

15:02.880 --> 15:04.130
casualties of, uh...

15:04.130 --> 15:07.040
uh...

15:07.040 --> 15:08.540
Does anyone
remember the name

15:08.540 --> 15:10.380
of the battle?
Anyone?

15:10.380 --> 15:12.500
Anyone?
LIZZIE (quietly):
Is it just me,

15:13.630 --> 15:15.880
or is Dad
a little day-drunk?

15:15.880 --> 15:19.080
(Alaric clearing his throat)
When isn't he?

15:19.080 --> 15:22.580
Josie?

15:22.580 --> 15:24.330
The Battle of Willow Creek.

15:24.330 --> 15:26.580
Exactly.

15:28.040 --> 15:30.080
ALARIC:
All those 27 civilians,
they were just rounded up

15:30.080 --> 15:34.290
by their friends
and neighbors,

15:34.290 --> 15:37.040
hmm, all because
they were different.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.750
Why is he still
wearing his watch?

15:43.080 --> 15:45.580
Why wouldn't he be?

15:46.580 --> 15:49.040
(school bell rings)
JOSIE:How could you forget?

15:50.500 --> 15:53.170
I'm sure I didn't forget.

15:53.170 --> 15:55.080
Just remind me?

15:55.080 --> 15:56.580
Homecoming Dance is tonight.
I know.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.080
How do I not have a date?

15:59.080 --> 16:01.130
This isn't about you, Lizzie.

16:01.130 --> 16:02.420
Yeah, I'm totally getting that.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.130
What I need you
to do is

16:04.130 --> 16:05.670
just get Dad's watch,
like you promised.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.790
Stefanie Salvatore's dad
gave him the watch.

16:09.080 --> 16:12.250
It's a magical object
that I can siphon

16:12.250 --> 16:13.750
so I can take things
to the next level with Connor.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.500
And by, um,
"take things to the next level,"

16:15.500 --> 16:19.290
you mean...
I'm gonna show him I'm a witch.

16:19.290 --> 16:21.830
Oh, thank God.
I mean, don't get me wrong,

16:21.830 --> 16:23.880
that is a terrible idea,
but for a second, I thought...
Then I'm

16:23.880 --> 16:26.960
gonna have sex with him.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.130
Yeah. That was it.

16:28.130 --> 16:29.750
You promised
you wouldn't let me down.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.960
Actually do it for a change.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.170
(snoring softly)

16:46.830 --> 16:51.330
(whispers):
This is so lame.

16:51.330 --> 16:53.500
Yeah. (scoffs)
Tell me about it.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.250
You suck at granting wishes.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.500
No. You suck
at making them.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.630
(gasps) You are totally
manipulating things

17:02.630 --> 17:05.830
to make me miserable.

17:05.830 --> 17:07.380
There is no world
in which this would happen.

17:07.380 --> 17:09.880
Shh!

17:09.880 --> 17:11.170
You're gonna wake
up your father.

17:11.170 --> 17:14.040
(belches softly)

17:15.080 --> 17:17.630
Oh, well, maybe not.

17:17.630 --> 17:19.750
But, for the record,

17:19.750 --> 17:22.420
I can't lie.

17:22.420 --> 17:23.460
Everything
you are experiencing

17:23.460 --> 17:25.500
is, in fact,

17:25.500 --> 17:26.880
a potential reality

17:26.880 --> 17:28.540
that has occurred

17:28.540 --> 17:29.960
as a direct result of your wish.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.080
Whatever.
This world

17:32.880 --> 17:34.580
does make sense,
when you think about it.

17:34.580 --> 17:37.130
Your father built
the Salvatore School

17:37.130 --> 17:39.330
soyoucould thrive.

17:39.330 --> 17:41.580
You and your sister were born
of a dangerous coven

17:41.580 --> 17:44.420
known for breeding...
(whistles) ...psychotics,

17:44.420 --> 17:47.080
and so he built
a safe place to shield you

17:47.080 --> 17:49.830
from your darkest
impulses.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.330
And then you went
and wished his dream away

17:51.330 --> 17:55.040
because it
wasn't perfect.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.250
Well, now the students here
don't care about protecting

17:57.250 --> 17:59.750
your fragile ego.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.750
So you are
the school freak,

18:01.750 --> 18:03.920
and your sister gets to shine.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.750
Just tell me
how to get out of here.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.750
Well...

18:09.750 --> 18:12.170
you could use another wish.

18:12.170 --> 18:15.170
But, like I said,

18:15.170 --> 18:17.170
language is important.

18:17.170 --> 18:19.130
Besides, you think
I want to be here?

18:19.130 --> 18:21.580
(scoffs) I've spent
nearly 500 years

18:21.580 --> 18:24.500
granting awful wishes
to self-involved humans

18:24.500 --> 18:26.540
before we even met...
This isn't

18:26.540 --> 18:28.670
aboutyou.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.580
I rest my case.

18:30.580 --> 18:32.710
(door opens)

18:40.250 --> 18:45.380
LIZZIE: I can't let you
go through with this.

18:45.380 --> 18:49.460
You need to stop.
Dana and Connor denied it,

18:49.460 --> 18:51.460
and I believe them.
Why would you believe
them over me?

18:51.460 --> 18:54.250
'Cause you always do this.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.880
Any time things are going well
for me, you have an episode,

18:55.880 --> 18:58.380
and you ruin everything
just to steal the spotlight.

18:58.380 --> 19:00.960
I mean, honestly,
Lizzie, if I believed

19:00.960 --> 19:02.380
every paranoid delusion
that came out of your mouth,

19:02.380 --> 19:03.960
I'd be just
as crazy as you.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.750
Jo...
Look, I'm sorry.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.250
I don't want to hurt
your feelings,

19:08.250 --> 19:10.420
but I have spent
my entire life

19:10.420 --> 19:11.790
trying to make you feel
okay about yourself.

19:11.790 --> 19:13.500
Watched Dad kill himself
trying to do it, too.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.790
And why do you think

19:15.790 --> 19:17.040
that he drinks all the time?

19:17.040 --> 19:19.040
He hates his job.
The only reason

19:19.040 --> 19:20.830
why he works here is
to keep an eye on you.

19:20.830 --> 19:22.880
Mom makes any excuse that
she can to be out of town,

19:22.880 --> 19:24.630
because seeing
him like this

19:24.630 --> 19:26.380
makes her sad,
'cause he's completely given up.

19:26.380 --> 19:30.130
So I am done

19:30.130 --> 19:31.960
making excuses for you.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.630
I am done worrying about
when you are going to snap.

19:33.630 --> 19:37.250
And I am done letting you
control my happiness.

19:37.250 --> 19:40.130
I love Connor, and
tonight I'm going

19:40.130 --> 19:42.710
to show him just how much.

19:42.710 --> 19:44.380
Now, give me the watch.

19:49.670 --> 19:53.750
I'm sorry.

19:58.540 --> 20:02.880
It's for your own good.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.040
I hate you.

20:05.040 --> 20:08.330
Josie...

20:08.330 --> 20:10.960
No.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.500
Wait.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.290
(low rumbling)
Please just...

20:14.290 --> 20:15.960
(rumbling growing louder)
wait.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.460
(distorted, echoing):
Stop...!

20:20.500 --> 20:24.420
(students gasping, screaming)

20:29.830 --> 20:31.670
(muted, indistinct chatter)

20:34.290 --> 20:37.130
(voices distorting, echoing)

20:37.540 --> 20:42.000
BOY:
This could go viral.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.830
What the hell?!

20:43.830 --> 20:45.080
We got to go.
We got to go now.

20:45.080 --> 20:47.750
Now. Come on.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.130
Nothing to see.

20:49.130 --> 20:50.750
(engine roars, tires squeal)

20:50.750 --> 20:53.420
(tires screech)

21:02.630 --> 21:06.630
Looks like you guys
could use some help.

21:06.630 --> 21:09.130
Uh-uh. No, we
are all good.

21:09.130 --> 21:11.630
That "M."

21:11.630 --> 21:12.750
Mikaelson.
Like the boarding school?

21:12.750 --> 21:14.830
Kaleb, compel the students
to forget what they've seen.

21:14.830 --> 21:18.080
On it.
Jed,

21:18.080 --> 21:19.170
establish a perimeter.

21:19.170 --> 21:20.790
Lock the place down.

21:20.790 --> 21:21.830
Copy.
Pedro.

21:21.830 --> 21:23.380
Call in the chopper.

21:24.790 --> 21:26.080
Green light, Maverick.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.000
Uh, I-I said
that we're good.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.210
Okay? Josie and I
do not want to be superheroes.

21:30.210 --> 21:32.960
Yeah. Speak
for yourself.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.130
We're not here for you.

21:35.130 --> 21:36.130
We're here for him.

21:40.380 --> 21:44.460
(scoffing)

21:45.790 --> 21:46.670
Son of a bitch.

21:52.040 --> 21:56.040
HOPE:Make yourselves at home.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.000
This place, it's like a...

21:58.000 --> 22:00.830
dream come true.

22:00.830 --> 22:02.630
HOPE:
Perhaps you've heard

22:02.630 --> 22:04.460
my father has had
a checkered past.

22:04.460 --> 22:07.040
But when he had me,
things changed.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.880
There wasn't a school he could
send someone like me to,

22:08.880 --> 22:10.630
so he built this one.

22:10.630 --> 22:14.290
And as you can see,
it's been quite the success.So much so
that he's currently overseas

22:14.290 --> 22:15.330
establishing
our European branch,

22:15.330 --> 22:17.460
which is why we're in need
of a new headmaster.

22:17.460 --> 22:20.210
I think I'm gonna be sick.

22:21.420 --> 22:22.750
Sorry if the chopper ride
was too bumpy.

22:22.750 --> 22:24.710
Bathroom's
down the hall.
I know where it is.

22:29.420 --> 22:33.420
(gasps)

22:33.420 --> 22:35.420
Screw this world.

22:36.210 --> 22:38.670
I want my final wish.

22:38.670 --> 22:40.500
Have you even noticed
how pleased the rest

22:40.500 --> 22:42.920
of your family seems

22:42.920 --> 22:44.830
with this reality?

22:44.830 --> 22:47.670
(laughing)

22:47.670 --> 22:49.420
They're my freaking wishes,

22:49.420 --> 22:53.210
right?
Indeed.

22:53.210 --> 22:54.670
But if this is to be
your third wish,

22:54.670 --> 22:57.710
might I suggest you wish
for what you truly want.

22:57.710 --> 23:01.170
Isolate your biggest problem.

23:01.170 --> 23:02.670
Show it no mercy.

23:04.580 --> 23:08.880
(indistinct chatter)

23:10.540 --> 23:14.830
(quietly):
I wish

23:14.830 --> 23:16.170
Hope Mikaelson was never born.

23:16.170 --> 23:20.040
Your wish is my command.

23:20.540 --> 23:22.790
KALEB:
Hey.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.670
Hey.

23:26.670 --> 23:29.290
Hey. What's-your-name.

23:29.290 --> 23:31.380
Sun's almost down.
We can't stay here.

23:31.380 --> 23:34.250
JED: Patrols
will be out soon.

23:34.250 --> 23:35.630
We got to move.

23:35.630 --> 23:37.710
(exhales)

23:37.710 --> 23:39.330
Where the hell are we?

23:39.330 --> 23:40.790
(scoffs)

23:40.790 --> 23:41.790
Damn, white girl.

23:41.790 --> 23:43.080
Mystic Falls.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.500
You said your father could
help us get out of here.

23:44.500 --> 23:46.250
Maybe down to Mexico.
Dr. Saltzman is

23:46.250 --> 23:48.330
your father, right?
And you know where to find him?

23:48.960 --> 23:50.330
Why are their eyes
all scratched out?

23:54.040 --> 23:55.830
(sighs)

23:58.080 --> 23:59.920
'Cause they're finally free.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.250
Hey. Come on.
Death is better

24:01.250 --> 24:03.250
than being hunted by Triad
until you starve, bruh.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.080
(helicopter passes overhead)

24:05.630 --> 24:07.380
Speaking of.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.250
It's time to bounce.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.500
Okay, lead the way, blondie.

24:14.210 --> 24:15.880
I hope the Supernatural Railroad
isn't just a fairy tale.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.460
(leaves crunching)

24:30.420 --> 24:34.580
(soft chatter)

24:46.580 --> 24:51.000
Welcome to the Resistance.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.670
I wish I could say it was
under better circumstances.

24:53.830 --> 24:56.290
You've got a lot of nerve,
showing up here.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.580
Penelope,

25:03.540 --> 25:04.670
what's going on?
At least you earned

25:04.670 --> 25:06.000
this mental breakdown.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.790
Leave,

25:07.790 --> 25:09.000
before I feed you to the vamps.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.250
Please, just tell me
what's happening.

25:10.250 --> 25:12.080
Out!

25:14.750 --> 25:18.830
Who died?

25:18.830 --> 25:20.130
(scoffs)
(footsteps approaching)

25:21.000 --> 25:22.130
Dad.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.290
What's going on?
Why is this world

25:26.290 --> 25:28.170
like this?

25:28.170 --> 25:29.170
(sighs)

25:30.460 --> 25:31.330
Sweetie...

25:34.540 --> 25:36.630
...you can't be here.

25:37.830 --> 25:39.210
(murmuring)

25:39.210 --> 25:41.290
You ran away.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.790
I've been worried sick,
looking for you.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.210
Why would I run?

25:47.250 --> 25:49.210
You don't remember
what happened?

25:50.290 --> 25:51.880
Must be some sort of amnesia
triggered by the trauma.

25:51.880 --> 25:55.000
What trauma?
It doesn't matter now.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.330
All that matters
is that you're home.

25:57.330 --> 25:58.670
Not that we can
stay much longer.

25:58.670 --> 26:00.580
Triad's closing in every day.

26:00.580 --> 26:02.880
The world knows about vampires?

26:04.170 --> 26:06.630
You've forgotten
more than I thought.

26:07.580 --> 26:09.540
Klaus Mikaelson lost everything

26:09.540 --> 26:11.540
that anchored him
to his humanity,

26:11.540 --> 26:13.380
and so he shut it off
two years ago

26:13.380 --> 26:15.210
and started a war.

26:15.210 --> 26:16.500
Outed supernaturals
in the process.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.210
And just like that,
Triad had an ugly,

26:18.210 --> 26:20.250
racist platform to stand on,

26:20.250 --> 26:22.330
and nothing's been
safe ever since.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.540
Where's Josie?

26:28.790 --> 26:29.460
Dad.

26:32.750 --> 26:34.500
Where is she?

26:36.170 --> 26:38.170
She's dead, Elizabeth.

26:38.580 --> 26:40.790
The vigil's for her.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.630
No. (shudders)
No, no.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.290
She-she can't...

26:49.290 --> 26:51.290
she can't be.

26:51.290 --> 26:53.040
That's not what I wanted.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.460
I know.
But, right now, you just...

26:54.460 --> 26:56.130
need to get some sleep.
No.

26:56.130 --> 26:57.710
(exhales)
No, no.

26:57.710 --> 26:59.210
I-I can-- I can fix this.

26:59.210 --> 27:01.380
I-I can make
this whole

27:01.380 --> 27:03.210
miserable world go away.

27:03.210 --> 27:04.790
Josie's not really gone.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.130
I promise, okay?

27:06.130 --> 27:07.750
I'll fix it.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.960
Genie?!

27:09.960 --> 27:11.250
Genie!
Elizabeth,
please, please...

27:11.250 --> 27:13.210
This was my last wish.
(exhales)

27:13.210 --> 27:15.380
I can't take it back.

27:15.380 --> 27:17.210
(crying):
Oh. I've ruined everything.

27:17.210 --> 27:20.500
Oh, no. It's my fault.
Penelope.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.040
It's all my fault!

27:23.040 --> 27:24.750
Penelope!

27:24.750 --> 27:25.790
(screams)

27:25.790 --> 27:27.000
(sobbing)

27:34.670 --> 27:38.750
(creaking)

27:40.040 --> 27:40.790
Damn you, Genie.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
It's Jin--

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
(exhales)
Never mind.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.670
Don't be so hard
on yourself,

27:47.670 --> 27:49.170
even if your father did
just lock you up in a cellar

27:49.170 --> 27:51.080
for your own safety.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.710
Third wish is always tricky.

27:52.710 --> 27:54.000
Better luck on your next one.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.710
My next one?

27:57.420 --> 27:59.210
I-I get another wish?

27:59.210 --> 28:01.670
Whoever told you
a jinni only grants three?

28:01.670 --> 28:04.000
Aladdin.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Every genie story ever.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.330
Ajinni can grant
or ignore any wish they choose.

28:07.330 --> 28:11.170
We won't work
against our own self-interest,

28:11.170 --> 28:13.080
so you can forget
about wishing me dead.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.330
But if you'd like another
wish to reset your life

28:15.330 --> 28:18.170
right back to where we began,

28:18.170 --> 28:20.170
I can do that.

28:20.170 --> 28:21.750
On one condition.

28:21.750 --> 28:23.080
Anything.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.290
What?

28:24.290 --> 28:25.540
You give me the urn.

28:25.540 --> 28:28.040
LIZZIE:Oh, I knew you were

28:29.330 --> 28:31.000
gonna screw me.
You used my words against me,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
right from the start.
(chuckles)

28:33.000 --> 28:34.500
Like you said,
I'm a monster.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.330
Should've trusted your gut.

28:36.330 --> 28:38.040
You trapped me in
the worst situation imaginable,

28:38.040 --> 28:42.000
just so you could get
what you want!

28:42.000 --> 28:43.330
The urn is a small price to pay

28:43.330 --> 28:45.120
to cease suffering like this.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.460
You don't know anything
about suffering.

28:46.460 --> 28:49.830
Don't I?

28:49.830 --> 28:51.620
As all jinn are, I was born into
five centuries of suffering.

28:51.620 --> 28:55.670
500 years
of realizing

28:55.670 --> 28:57.170
other people's dreams
before I'd ever have

28:57.170 --> 28:58.830
the chance to pursue one

28:58.830 --> 29:00.000
of my own.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.330
And in the 499th year
of my term,

29:01.330 --> 29:03.330
I crossed paths
with a true monster.

29:03.330 --> 29:06.170
And it consumed me,

29:06.170 --> 29:07.920
sent me to a place
of total isolation,

29:07.920 --> 29:09.790
utter damnation.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.420
Malivore.

29:11.420 --> 29:12.420
I know.

29:12.420 --> 29:13.750
So what?

29:13.750 --> 29:15.500
I wandered there,

29:15.500 --> 29:16.670
lost and alone,

29:16.670 --> 29:18.500
until I was given one
final chance to win my freedom.

29:18.500 --> 29:22.500
So accept my offer
and wish me the urn.

29:22.500 --> 29:25.830
If I wish you
the urn,

29:25.830 --> 29:27.540
I'm giving you the key
to a supernatural apocalypse.

29:27.540 --> 29:31.500
Isn't that technically
against your self-interest?

29:31.500 --> 29:34.080
Quite the opposite.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.210
It's my only hope.

29:35.210 --> 29:36.540
Because if I return the urn
to Malivore,

29:36.540 --> 29:38.750
then I am free

29:38.750 --> 29:40.000
and at peace.
Whatever happens

29:40.000 --> 29:41.870
after that is not my problem.

29:41.870 --> 29:43.830
Selfish.

29:43.830 --> 29:45.210
Said the pot to the kettle.

29:45.210 --> 29:47.040
I don't know why we're debating.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.210
This life
is dreadful.

29:48.210 --> 29:49.960
So wish it away!

29:49.960 --> 29:51.080
Shut up, okay?! I just--

29:51.080 --> 29:52.620
I need to think.
I need to find a loophole.

29:52.620 --> 29:55.830
There is no loophole.

29:55.830 --> 29:57.330
Magic always has a loophole.

29:57.330 --> 30:01.210
Yeah? Well,
you better find it quickly.

30:01.210 --> 30:03.460
Things are taking
a hell of a turn up there.

30:03.460 --> 30:06.080
What do you mean?

30:06.750 --> 30:07.670
(panting)

30:10.830 --> 30:12.080
(indistinct chatter)

30:12.080 --> 30:14.710
Dad?

30:14.710 --> 30:16.500
Lizzie.

30:17.540 --> 30:18.710
Did Penelope let you out?

30:18.710 --> 30:20.210
We've been working on getting
the right dosages for you.

30:20.210 --> 30:22.290
What are we doing?
Are we hiding?

30:22.290 --> 30:24.620
No, we're fighting.

30:24.620 --> 30:26.210
Triad got wind
of our location.

30:26.210 --> 30:28.790
With Josie gone,
we decided to take a stand

30:30.460 --> 30:32.290
and put an end to this
once and for all.

30:32.790 --> 30:35.290
Oh, God.

30:36.790 --> 30:38.000
You're gonna
get slaughtered.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.710
And it's all my fault.

30:39.710 --> 30:41.540
No, it's my fault.

30:41.540 --> 30:42.830
I should've never kept
that secret from you.

30:42.830 --> 30:44.920
What secret?

30:44.920 --> 30:46.330
Your mom and I had been waiting
for the right time

30:46.330 --> 30:48.290
to tell you a piece
of your family history, but...

30:48.290 --> 30:51.000
we waited too long.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
What family history?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.830
There's something that happens
to twins born into your coven,

30:54.830 --> 30:58.460
like you and Josie.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.120
When you turn 22,

31:00.120 --> 31:02.670
the Gemini must merge.

31:02.670 --> 31:04.920
Merge?

31:04.920 --> 31:05.920
It's a battle
of will.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.620
Only the strongest of
the two twins will survive it.

31:07.620 --> 31:10.540
So one of us would have
to kill the other one?

31:10.540 --> 31:15.420
We've been trying
to find a way to prevent it

31:15.420 --> 31:17.790
ever since
you were little kids.

31:17.790 --> 31:19.710
That's why your mom's
always off traveling.

31:19.710 --> 31:22.620
We tried to keep it from you
as long as we could.

31:22.620 --> 31:25.370
But when we turned the house
into a rescue operation,

31:25.370 --> 31:28.000
one of the witches
who was passing through

31:28.000 --> 31:29.750
told you the story
of the Gemini, and you...

31:29.750 --> 31:33.330
Dad,

31:33.330 --> 31:34.580
what did I do?

31:34.580 --> 31:37.170
You got scared.

31:37.170 --> 31:39.460
You had one of your episodes,
and you went dark.

31:39.670 --> 31:43.750
Paranoid.

31:43.750 --> 31:45.420
To you, Josie became
your biggest threat.

31:45.420 --> 31:48.210
You became obsessed
with winning,

31:49.080 --> 31:52.040
and then you lost control.

31:52.580 --> 31:54.370
(crying):
I killed her.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.040
It was an accident.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.460
No matter how
you say it...

32:00.460 --> 32:02.710
...I killed her.

32:04.620 --> 32:06.330
You must hate me so much.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.750
No.

32:11.750 --> 32:14.170
The only person I hate is myself
for failing you both.

32:14.170 --> 32:18.540
No. Dad, I've been
to other places,

32:18.540 --> 32:21.540
other realities,

32:21.540 --> 32:24.750
and I know that
that sounds crazy,but you need
to believe me.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.500
You always do everything that
you can to protect me and Josie.

32:26.500 --> 32:29.920
Time after time.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.870
World after world.

32:31.870 --> 32:33.960
Then I wish we could be in one
of your other worlds right now.

32:33.960 --> 32:37.330
No matter what happens,
I need you to hear this.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.620
To believe me.

32:39.620 --> 32:41.620
There's a world
where your dream came true.

32:43.210 --> 32:46.330
You built a school
for me and Josie,

32:46.330 --> 32:50.040
and it was so beautiful.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.540
And we were safe

32:52.540 --> 32:55.080
and loved.

32:55.080 --> 32:56.420
And you helped so many people.

32:56.580 --> 32:59.620
And I was just too stupid

33:01.000 --> 33:03.920
and jealous to see it.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.920
In this other world,

33:05.920 --> 33:07.960
did I tell you about the Merge?

33:09.750 --> 33:12.170
Then I guess
we were both pretty stupid, huh?

33:14.580 --> 33:18.790
(footsteps approaching)

33:18.790 --> 33:20.790
It's time.

33:22.620 --> 33:23.420
No. Dad, wait.

33:26.750 --> 33:28.670
I can get us out of this.

33:28.670 --> 33:30.170
I just need to think.

33:30.170 --> 33:31.620
That's a good idea.

33:31.620 --> 33:33.000
You think, baby.

33:39.330 --> 33:43.920
(voice breaking):
I love you.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.670
I love you so much.

33:47.580 --> 33:49.750
(crying)

33:54.580 --> 33:59.080
Let's go give them their war.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.420
(cheering)

34:07.790 --> 34:11.920
Think. Think.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.120
Not exactly your strong suit.

34:14.120 --> 34:17.170
This would all
go so much easier

34:18.120 --> 34:19.870
if you'd just
accept my offer.

34:19.870 --> 34:21.080
Zip it, Smurfette.

34:21.080 --> 34:22.580
I know there's a way
we can both get what we want.

34:22.580 --> 34:25.580
I just have to think
of the perfect wish.

34:25.580 --> 34:28.210
As I've told you,
I will not grant you anything

34:28.210 --> 34:30.040
unless it involves me
finding peace.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.870
And I said quiet!
(explosion)

34:31.870 --> 34:34.250
Maybe you need a
little incentive.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.330
Incoming!

34:40.080 --> 34:41.750
(indistinct shouting)

34:45.580 --> 34:49.710
Icaeus.

35:09.870 --> 35:14.000
Incentivized?

35:17.080 --> 35:21.210
Okay, fine.

35:21.210 --> 35:22.790
Bouncing through your wonky
worlds taught me something.

35:22.790 --> 35:26.080
I am selfish.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.790
I've made mistakes.

35:27.790 --> 35:29.210
But giving you the urn

35:29.210 --> 35:30.580
would be
the biggest mistake of all.

35:30.580 --> 35:32.420
It could ruin
everyone's life,

35:32.420 --> 35:34.420
destroy my father's dream

35:34.420 --> 35:35.750
of making any reality
a better place.

35:35.750 --> 35:38.000
It's bad enough that
I did that to him

35:38.000 --> 35:39.580
time after time.
I can't do it again.

35:39.580 --> 35:41.960
You sure about that?

35:56.580 --> 36:01.080
When I fix this, he'll be fine.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.670
And I won't give you
the satisfaction of breaking me.

36:03.670 --> 36:06.460
You were already broken.
That's why I chose you

36:06.460 --> 36:08.620
in the first place.
That just means

36:08.620 --> 36:10.580
that you can't break me
any more.

36:10.580 --> 36:12.790
So read my lips.

36:12.790 --> 36:14.250
I am never wishing you that urn.

36:14.540 --> 36:18.830
You want it so bad?

36:18.830 --> 36:20.460
Why didn't you just take it when
it was right in front of you?

36:24.620 --> 36:28.870
Because you can't.

36:28.870 --> 36:31.120
That's it, isn't it?

36:31.120 --> 36:32.790
You said it yourself.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.620
You can only do
what someone wishes you to do.

36:34.870 --> 36:39.120
That's your curse.

36:39.120 --> 36:41.500
And you are just as broken
as I am.

36:43.710 --> 36:44.830
But I know how to fix you.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.540
How?

36:50.540 --> 36:52.540
By winning your dumbass game.

36:52.540 --> 36:54.710
I wish that you had never met

36:56.170 --> 36:59.290
the monster
that sent you to Malivore.

37:01.710 --> 37:02.540
Huh.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.120
If I never went to Malivore...

37:07.120 --> 37:09.460
You'd have completed
your 500 years of service.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.540
(exhales)

37:12.540 --> 37:13.750
I'd be free.

37:13.750 --> 37:15.540
That's my wish.

37:15.540 --> 37:17.250
Take it or leave it.

37:17.250 --> 37:19.330
Your wish is my command.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.670
Boom! Suck on that!

37:22.670 --> 37:24.170
But there's a catch.

37:24.170 --> 37:26.120
We will never have met, either,
which means...

37:26.120 --> 37:28.920
I won't remember the Merge.

37:28.920 --> 37:31.000
Not consciously.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.620
You'll be just like
all those poor souls

37:32.620 --> 37:34.420
I helped over the centuries
who used their final wishes

37:34.420 --> 37:36.830
to reset their realities.

37:36.830 --> 37:38.710
What happened to them?

37:38.710 --> 37:42.790
They found their worlds
just as they left them. Only their minds weren't.

37:42.790 --> 37:44.870
Because somehow
our journeys stayed with them

37:44.870 --> 37:47.420
and slowly drove them insane.

37:47.420 --> 37:50.790
It's like you said.

37:50.790 --> 37:52.710
There's always a loophole
with magic.

37:52.710 --> 37:55.330
And when you find out
your father's secret,

37:55.330 --> 37:57.790
as you inevitably will,

37:57.790 --> 37:59.370
history will likely
repeat itself,

37:59.370 --> 38:01.960
and you'll kill Josie
all over again.

38:01.960 --> 38:05.670
I take it back. I-I wish to...
I thank you

38:05.670 --> 38:07.460
for my freedom, Lizzie.
No!

38:07.460 --> 38:08.920
I said wait!

38:08.920 --> 38:10.330
(echoing):Wait!

38:10.330 --> 38:12.290
JOSIE:
Lizzie?

38:12.290 --> 38:13.960
Lizzie.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.960
Lizzie?

38:15.960 --> 38:17.710
Please don't be mad at Dad.

38:21.460 --> 38:22.540
Oh. What's happening?

38:25.790 --> 38:27.580
Why are you suffocating me?
I have no idea.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.620
Look, I don't know
when it started,

38:44.620 --> 38:46.910
but on a fundamental level,
I think I'm broken.

38:46.910 --> 38:51.750
And I realize
this is all very sudden,

38:51.750 --> 38:54.370
but I just, for whatever reason,

38:54.370 --> 38:56.870
have this feeling

38:56.870 --> 38:58.790
that something terrible isgonna happen if I don't change.

38:58.790 --> 39:02.660
ALARIC:
I... I'm so sorry, Caroline.

39:02.660 --> 39:04.200
I know, I should not have missed
your texts about the kids.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.790
It won't happen again.

39:06.790 --> 39:08.660
Lizzie's been vibrating
pretty high.

39:08.660 --> 39:10.870
You think she's on the verge
of an episode?

39:10.870 --> 39:13.290
Yeah. All right.

39:14.290 --> 39:16.370
I'll keep an eye on her.

39:16.370 --> 39:18.410
Any other leads?

39:19.790 --> 39:21.790
(sighs) All right.

39:21.790 --> 39:24.580
Well, keep at it.

39:24.580 --> 39:27.870
We'll find a solution.

39:27.870 --> 39:29.750
Yeah.
(phone beeps)

39:29.750 --> 39:32.330
(sighs)

39:41.290 --> 39:45.540
(knocking at door)

39:45.540 --> 39:47.330
You got a sec?

39:47.330 --> 39:49.120
Well, this morning's evidence
to the contrary,

39:49.120 --> 39:51.910
I always have time for you.

39:51.910 --> 39:53.450
What's on your mind?

39:53.450 --> 39:55.450
I'm sorry about earlier.

39:55.450 --> 39:58.040
Mom gave me all of these tools

39:58.040 --> 40:00.910
to manage my ups and downs,
but...

40:00.910 --> 40:04.000
they all go out the window
when it comes to Hope.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.080
That seems pretty self-aware.

40:07.080 --> 40:09.750
What brought this on?

40:11.250 --> 40:12.000
I don't know.

40:15.410 --> 40:17.120
Well...

40:17.120 --> 40:18.700
maybe it'll come to you.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.120
In the meantime,
I appreciate you trying.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.500
I love you, Dad.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.700
Aw. I love you, too, sweetheart.

40:25.700 --> 40:28.160
(grunts)

40:29.580 --> 40:31.580
What's that?

40:31.580 --> 40:33.250
Oh! This is...

40:33.250 --> 40:35.080
nothing you need to worry about.

40:37.540 --> 40:39.000
(sighs)

40:39.000 --> 40:40.790
LIZZIE:The thoughts in my head,

40:40.790 --> 40:42.710
I think that they have
something to do with Hope.

40:42.710 --> 40:46.160
Hey.
Hey.

40:46.160 --> 40:49.160
What's all that?
Oh, I was thinking

40:49.160 --> 40:51.660
we could spell a barrier
around the urn

40:51.660 --> 40:53.710
so when the next monster
shows up, we can trap it.

40:53.710 --> 40:56.620
Want to help?

40:58.000 --> 40:59.870
Pass.

41:00.870 --> 41:03.710
But I can't
put my finger on it.

41:05.460 --> 41:08.370
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

41:08.660 --> 41:11.620
Any thoughts?

41:12.830 --> 41:14.830
I don't know, Lizzie.

41:14.830 --> 41:16.620
Sounds like you got
a lot going on.

41:16.620 --> 41:19.000
(whooshing)

41:19.000 --> 41:21.460
Isn't it past your curfew,
Pedro?

41:21.460 --> 41:24.620
Go to bed.

41:24.620 --> 41:25.870
And leave the sandwich.

41:25.870 --> 41:27.370
But you said you wanted to talk.

41:27.370 --> 41:29.000
Did I?

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
(sighs)

41:36.750 --> 41:41.000
Can't imagine why.
