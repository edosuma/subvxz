00:00.601 --> 00:03.008
<i>Previously on</i>
Political Animals...

00:03.175 --> 00:05.876
<i>Before the suicide story
broke, I went for five months</i>

00:05.944 --> 00:07.277
without doing blow--
I was good, Dougie!

00:07.345 --> 00:08.712
I'll give you the money.

00:08.780 --> 00:10.213
<i>You're still in love</i>
<i>with him, aren't you?</i>

00:10.281 --> 00:11.214
<i>Look at you-- the smartest,</i>

00:11.282 --> 00:13.083
most powerful woman
on the planet,

00:13.151 --> 00:14.284
and you can't even see

00:14.352 --> 00:16.186
that he is just gonna
hurt you all over again.

00:16.254 --> 00:17.588
<i>Come on, baby,</i> <i>it's me talking.</i>

00:17.655 --> 00:19.389
<i>Just say it--</i>
<i>say the words.</i>

00:19.457 --> 00:20.424
<i>Yes, Bud.</i>

00:20.491 --> 00:22.225
I am gonna run for president.

00:22.293 --> 00:23.594
<i>Without you.</i>

00:23.661 --> 00:24.795
<i>My parents,</i>
<i>they have spent their lives</i>

00:24.862 --> 00:25.796
<i>putting this country</i>

00:25.863 --> 00:26.997
before our family.

00:27.065 --> 00:28.398
Somebody has to put
our family first.

00:28.466 --> 00:29.700
I can't print this
without confirmation.

00:29.767 --> 00:30.934
Find it.

00:31.002 --> 00:34.171
My mother is going to run
again, against Garcetti.

00:34.238 --> 00:36.573
I'm sorry, that's all
I can tell you.

00:38.509 --> 00:40.110
After winning
several early contests,

00:40.177 --> 00:41.744
your wife's poll numbers
have been slipping,

00:41.812 --> 00:43.213
particularly with women.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.115
People are starting to wonder
whether Mrs. Hammond's

00:45.182 --> 00:46.616
so-called "woman problem"--

00:46.684 --> 00:47.817
Nonsense.

00:47.885 --> 00:49.119
Elaine Hammond
has done more for women

00:49.186 --> 00:51.121
than any candidate
in the primary.

00:51.188 --> 00:53.423
She's championed women's
health issues for 30 years,

00:53.491 --> 00:55.191
she rallied for Justice
Nash's appointment

00:55.259 --> 00:56.326
to the Supreme Court,

00:56.393 --> 00:57.393
and she's been speaking out

00:57.461 --> 00:58.761
on domestic abuse
since law school.

00:58.829 --> 01:00.463
And that's not to mention
her work in Illinois,

01:00.531 --> 01:04.501
where, by the way, she's the
governor, Mike, not "Mrs."

01:04.568 --> 01:07.337
Now, let me ask you
a question: Why is it,

01:07.404 --> 01:09.506
when most people ask about my
wife's "woman problem,"

01:09.573 --> 01:12.175
they don't tend
to have a vagina?

01:14.878 --> 01:17.213
"Vagina." The former President
of the United States

01:17.280 --> 01:18.347
just said "vagina."

01:18.415 --> 01:19.315
Big deal, Barry.

01:19.382 --> 01:21.450
50% of the population has one.

01:21.518 --> 01:22.818
Yeah, well, I don't need
to run a poll

01:22.886 --> 01:24.820
to confirm that it makes voters
a little uncomfortable

01:24.888 --> 01:25.855
when a president says--

01:25.922 --> 01:26.922
Please don't say
"vagina" again.

01:26.990 --> 01:29.992
That word--
especially this president.

01:30.060 --> 01:32.428
My husband has been busting his
ass on the trail for weeks now.

01:32.895 --> 01:33.996
Bud is melting down.

01:34.063 --> 01:35.364
The thought that Garcetti
could, in any way,

01:35.431 --> 01:37.532
eclipse his own legacy
is driving him nuts.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.902
Now California is a jump ball
and he is killing us.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.738
I'll talk to him.

01:42.805 --> 01:45.073
All right, everybody,
it's been a long day.

01:45.141 --> 01:47.042
We have three states
to visit tomorrow.

01:47.110 --> 01:48.677
Thank you so much.

01:48.745 --> 01:50.145
Get some rest.

01:50.213 --> 01:51.346
Good night.

01:53.015 --> 01:56.351
I need you to wrangle
your father.

01:56.419 --> 01:58.954
Me and what army of
psychologists?

01:59.021 --> 02:00.021
He'll listen to you.

02:00.089 --> 02:01.423
Just keep him on script.

02:01.490 --> 02:03.458
Settle him down.

02:03.526 --> 02:05.527
Your father wants me to win
this more than anyone.

02:06.896 --> 02:07.929
You know what I mean.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.163
He's not out to sabotage me.

02:09.231 --> 02:10.999
He wants to help, and he can.

02:11.067 --> 02:14.436
Douglas, you are the only one
I can trust with this.

02:16.005 --> 02:18.006
<i>I'm happy to present</i>
<i>the Council of Women</i>

02:18.074 --> 02:21.076
Lifetime Achievement Award
to Justice Diane Nash.

02:21.143 --> 02:23.311
As you know,
I was privileged to be a student

02:23.379 --> 02:25.246
of Professor Nash's
in law school,

02:25.314 --> 02:27.215
though, truth be told,

02:27.283 --> 02:30.218
she gave me some of the lowest
grades I have ever received.

02:31.320 --> 02:32.420
Though Bud's were worse.

02:34.556 --> 02:38.192
It was a great day for this
country when President Hammond

02:38.260 --> 02:40.995
appointed Diane Nash
to the Supreme Court.

02:47.169 --> 02:49.537
As the first
openly gay person nominated

02:49.605 --> 02:51.339
to the highest court
of the land,

02:51.407 --> 02:54.609
the world expected her
confirmation to be brutal.

02:54.677 --> 02:56.144
It was.

02:56.211 --> 02:59.914
What they didn't expect was that
Judge Nash would respond

02:59.982 --> 03:03.785
with such grace, wit
and intelligence

03:03.852 --> 03:06.187
that her hearings turned
public opinion her way,

03:06.255 --> 03:09.090
and made her confirmation
inevitable.

03:09.158 --> 03:11.059
Diane would be
the first to tell you

03:11.126 --> 03:14.028
that a gulf still remains
between the promise

03:14.096 --> 03:15.697
of equality for women

03:15.764 --> 03:18.199
and the reality for women
around the globe.

03:19.201 --> 03:21.102
It's 2012.

03:21.670 --> 03:24.238
We will not let cynical
politicians

03:24.306 --> 03:26.640
roll back
the reproductive rights

03:26.708 --> 03:28.509
we have fought so hard to gain.

03:32.814 --> 03:35.216
Why do you still give Bud
all the credit?

03:35.283 --> 03:37.251
Mm...

03:37.819 --> 03:41.188
It was you who forced my
nomination down his throat.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.423
It was Bud's appointment.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.292
But you strong-armed him.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.860
Like you
strong-armed Garcetti

03:46.928 --> 03:49.763
into sending Bud to Iran
a few weeks ago.

03:50.765 --> 03:53.266
And that speech just now--

03:53.334 --> 03:55.268
you running for
something, lady?

03:55.336 --> 03:58.472
I thought our deal was that
we don't talk politics.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.507
Allow me to amend it.

04:00.575 --> 04:03.910
President Garcetti's not
a novice at this.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.579
I can handle the president.

04:07.015 --> 04:09.483
How is Corinne?

04:09.550 --> 04:11.952
I saw her for a
split second yesterday.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.554
She didn't recognize me.

04:14.622 --> 04:15.589
That day is coming

04:15.656 --> 04:17.357
and that is the day
I just dread.

04:17.425 --> 04:20.327
I'm so sorry, Diane.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.329
Watch out for Garcetti.

04:22.397 --> 04:23.864
He's watching you.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.932
He's getting ready to strike.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.301
Barrish is running
for president.

04:29.069 --> 04:29.969
Says who?

04:30.037 --> 04:31.304
Everyone in DC.

04:31.371 --> 04:32.705
After the whole Iran incident?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.607
Her numbers are even
higher than before.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.809
Susan, you and Barrish
are buds these days.

04:36.877 --> 04:37.810
What do you think?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.879
That it's cocktail chatter.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.214
It's a lot of chatter.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.616
As long as Elaine Barrish
is alive and popular,

04:43.684 --> 04:45.685
people are gonna be afraid
she's gonna run for president.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.754
Doesn't mean it's true.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.322
What is true it that
Garcetti's team

04:49.389 --> 04:50.890
is so afraid of
what she might do,

04:50.958 --> 04:52.592
they're preparing
a preemptive strike.

04:52.659 --> 04:55.361
That's the story,
and I'm working on it.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.462
All right.
Sounds good.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.664
Let's, uh, let's
move on to sports.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.634
Um, NFC East Special.

05:01.702 --> 05:02.602
Wait...

05:02.669 --> 05:05.138
I'd like to pitch something.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.140
I was shopping in Georgetown

05:07.207 --> 05:09.442
and noticed there are
two bus systems

05:09.510 --> 05:11.410
servicing the area--
the regular Metro buses

05:11.478 --> 05:14.680
and the Georgetown
local circulator--

05:14.748 --> 05:17.483
which I believe is better
maintained because

05:17.551 --> 05:19.452
only white people use them.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.720
You don't do
investigative pieces, Georgia.

05:22.922 --> 05:24.056
T.J. Hammond is
opening a nightclub.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.892
There's gotta be something
in there for the blog.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.894
Um, let's get back to sports.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.829
I like your two-parter

05:30.897 --> 05:32.665
on injured Redskins, uh,

05:32.732 --> 05:34.833
in the class-action
against the NFL, okay?

05:34.901 --> 05:38.337
What do you got on baseball
trades after the season?

06:23.083 --> 06:24.783
Brat.
We're having dinner.

06:24.851 --> 06:26.018
I'm coordinating
with Singapore's

06:26.086 --> 06:27.453
economic minister
on your behalf.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.787
Join us.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.859
Sorry... I had vendors
coming out of my ass.

06:34.627 --> 06:36.127
I gotta go back to the club.

06:36.195 --> 06:37.429
What's up?

06:39.265 --> 06:40.899
I thought that fell through.

06:40.966 --> 06:42.500
Oh, no.
It's happening.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.836
Wow. Mineral water.

06:46.038 --> 06:47.505
You're gonna bore me
off the wagon.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.174
Where'd you get
the money, sonny?

06:50.676 --> 06:52.877
Turns out my celebrity's
worth millions,

06:52.945 --> 06:56.414
and I'm devastatingly handsome
in low lighting.

06:58.717 --> 07:00.718
Uh, Mom, not to
rush you, but...

07:00.786 --> 07:01.986
Right. Okay.

07:02.054 --> 07:05.857
I am considering running
for president again.

07:07.660 --> 07:10.361
Well, I hate to be the one
to burst your bubble, babe,

07:10.429 --> 07:11.896
but that ain't news.

07:11.964 --> 07:15.100
Against Garcetti.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.502
Ethically, I will have to
resign from the Cabinet,

07:17.570 --> 07:20.805
so it's crucial nothing
leaks out before we're ready.

07:20.873 --> 07:23.641
Is this the point where you ask
us what we think,

07:23.709 --> 07:26.444
and then you ignore what we say,
and do whatever you want?

07:27.112 --> 07:30.781
Because I, for one, prefer not
to have the <i>New York Post</i>

07:30.849 --> 07:32.183
going through our garbage cans,

07:32.250 --> 07:34.652
counting our
liquor bottles again.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.654
And I know the boys don't want

07:36.722 --> 07:38.456
to go through the hell
we all barely survived

07:38.523 --> 07:41.325
two years ago,
so you can be Queen Shit

07:41.393 --> 07:43.394
of the United States
of Elaineland.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.797
Well, I'll take that
as a "nay."

07:46.865 --> 07:49.900
Douglas has agreed to be
my campaign manager.

07:49.968 --> 07:52.136
Well, don't hate me, Nana,

07:52.204 --> 07:54.939
but I think Mama would be
the best president

07:55.006 --> 07:56.073
we've ever had in this family.

07:56.141 --> 07:58.442
Okay. I'm out-voted.

07:58.510 --> 08:03.514
Well, you're all adults, so,
go ahead, ruin your lives.

08:03.582 --> 08:05.850
I don't care.

08:10.055 --> 08:11.255
Whoa!

08:11.323 --> 08:16.227
It's hot as a goat's ass
out there tonight.

08:16.294 --> 08:18.596
I was playing poker
at Senator Byron's.

08:18.663 --> 08:19.597
Thought I'd swing by.

08:19.664 --> 08:20.631
Sugar.
Oh!

08:20.699 --> 08:23.234
Hello.

08:25.270 --> 08:26.737
Weird seeing them together, huh?

08:28.240 --> 08:30.307
I'm going to go get
some more wine.

08:30.375 --> 08:32.676
Get me one of those shitty
mineral waters while you're up.

08:38.549 --> 08:40.984
You know...
you have a housekeeper.

08:41.052 --> 08:43.553
And you know
I like doing dishes.

08:43.621 --> 08:45.188
It calms me.

08:45.256 --> 08:47.691
I let you boys grow up soft.

08:47.758 --> 08:49.726
Running around the
governor's mansion

08:49.794 --> 08:51.628
like a couple of princes.

08:51.696 --> 08:53.163
Speaking, of, sugar,

08:53.231 --> 08:55.499
I'm heading
down that way tomorrow

08:55.566 --> 08:58.068
to run a little
reconnaissance mission

08:58.135 --> 08:59.302
before the campaign.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.137
You're not on the campaign.

09:01.205 --> 09:03.807
I found Jubal Jacobs.

09:03.875 --> 09:06.743
There's no sense
in staging a DNC coup,

09:06.811 --> 09:08.545
unless you know
you can pull it off,

09:08.613 --> 09:09.880
and Jubal's the only pollster

09:09.947 --> 09:11.548
who can read
the tea leaves this far out.

09:11.616 --> 09:15.685
I thought he wasn't talking
to you after what you did.

09:15.753 --> 09:17.320
Well, that was a pack of lies.

09:17.388 --> 09:20.490
Now me and Jubal
are on excellent terms.

09:20.558 --> 09:21.458
Come on, Elaine...

09:21.526 --> 09:23.226
now I know you want to hear

09:23.294 --> 09:25.395
what that crazy old
bastard has to say.

09:25.463 --> 09:27.130
Fine.

09:27.698 --> 09:29.365
Then Douglas is going with you.

09:29.433 --> 09:31.234
I can't.

09:31.301 --> 09:33.870
It's less than a week before
the East Asia Economic Summit.

09:33.937 --> 09:35.238
The last thing I have time for

09:35.305 --> 09:36.339
is some wild goose chase.

09:36.407 --> 09:38.241
Thanks for the water, asshole.

09:38.308 --> 09:40.009
It's largemouth season.

09:40.077 --> 09:41.878
That could be your cover,
in case anybody asks

09:41.945 --> 09:42.945
what we're doing down there.

09:43.013 --> 09:44.113
I love fishing.

09:44.181 --> 09:45.615
Too bad I'm busy.

09:45.682 --> 09:47.150
If I am going, you are going.

09:47.217 --> 09:48.584
No way.
Yeah.

09:48.652 --> 09:49.986
It'll be good for you guys

09:50.054 --> 09:52.422
to have a little
father-son time.

09:52.489 --> 09:54.957
Yeah, and I still got
the old tackle on mothballs.

09:55.025 --> 09:56.926
It's gonna be like old times.

09:56.994 --> 09:59.762
Hey, T.J.

09:59.830 --> 10:01.197
Come with me.

10:01.265 --> 10:02.532
Come on, son.

10:06.903 --> 10:09.038
I thought we were
leaving him out of this.

10:09.105 --> 10:10.539
Your father is right--

10:10.607 --> 10:13.642
we need a pollster
and Jubal is, well...

10:13.710 --> 10:15.144
under the radar.

10:15.212 --> 10:17.546
Garcetti is already
starting to suspect.

10:17.614 --> 10:22.051
Besides... you owe me
after what you did.

10:23.553 --> 10:27.122
You gave T.J. the money for that
nightclub, didn't you?

10:27.190 --> 10:29.291
He's an addict, Douglas.

10:29.359 --> 10:31.627
He should never be anywhere
near a nightclub.

10:31.695 --> 10:32.628
I thought...

10:32.696 --> 10:33.829
I don't know--

10:33.897 --> 10:35.564
that maybe if
he had something in his life--

10:35.632 --> 10:36.799
something that
he was proud of--

10:36.833 --> 10:39.201
that he could
stay clean this time.

10:41.071 --> 10:42.705
All right...

10:51.835 --> 10:53.002
She's running for president?

10:53.070 --> 10:55.004
And you're going to be
her campaign manger?!

10:55.072 --> 10:56.138
Douglas,
how long have you known?

10:56.206 --> 10:58.374
None of it means anything.
Okay?

10:58.442 --> 11:00.343
Dad is convinced
that his redneck savant

11:00.410 --> 11:02.378
is going to pull some
jackrabbit out of a hat.

11:02.446 --> 11:03.646
It's not gonna happen.

11:03.714 --> 11:05.414
You don't think she can win.

11:05.482 --> 11:07.950
No one has run against
their incumbent and won--

11:08.018 --> 11:09.886
not Reagan against Ford,
not Kennedy against Carter.

11:09.953 --> 11:11.387
And worse?

11:11.455 --> 11:13.456
This country is just going to
hate her all over again.

11:13.524 --> 11:15.625
They'll only see her ambition,
not how much she cares.

11:15.692 --> 11:17.293
If she could just wait out
Garcetti's second term...

11:17.361 --> 11:20.096
Well, baby, why don't you tell her?
I tried.

11:20.163 --> 11:22.064
It's useless.

11:22.132 --> 11:24.934
Annie, we'll just be
gone a couple of days.

11:25.002 --> 11:27.637
Okay?

11:34.678 --> 11:37.013
I love it when
you call me Annie.

11:40.551 --> 11:42.919
I know.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.328
<i>You know, during</i>

11:53.396 --> 11:54.896
the last year of
my father's life,

11:54.964 --> 11:56.631
he forgot he even had kids.

11:56.699 --> 11:59.434
He kept thinking
I was his brother Tommy,

11:59.502 --> 12:01.202
who was killed in Guadalcanal.

12:01.270 --> 12:03.138
It was tempting
to play along with him.

12:03.205 --> 12:06.107
To pretend I was this uncle
that I'd never met...

12:08.411 --> 12:09.577
How's Corin?

12:09.645 --> 12:11.179
Her name is Corinne.

12:11.247 --> 12:15.817
And you and I have
exchanged maybe 100 words

12:15.885 --> 12:19.054
before this sudden sympathy.

12:19.121 --> 12:21.990
You must want to spend more
time with her, before you...

12:22.058 --> 12:23.625
Hmm.

12:23.693 --> 12:25.460
My retirement

12:25.528 --> 12:29.164
is not a conversation you're
entitled to, Mr. President,

12:29.231 --> 12:32.367
neither personally
nor constitutionally.

12:32.435 --> 12:35.303
And if I said I was considering
Elaine Barrish to replace you?

12:38.074 --> 12:40.408
She's your protégé, Diane.

12:40.476 --> 12:43.478
It would be like having you on
the bench for another 30 years.

12:43.546 --> 12:46.881
Which is why Senate Republicans
would block her confirmation.

12:46.949 --> 12:48.550
Zelkovic would start a circus.

12:48.617 --> 12:49.918
But Pike's re-election hinges on

12:49.985 --> 12:51.152
Elaine's core constituency.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.621
Shaw uses Pike as a fig leaf,

12:53.689 --> 12:55.256
she gets out of committee
11 to seven.

12:55.324 --> 12:56.891
We predict 85 votes
on the floor--

12:56.959 --> 12:59.360
if we act quickly.
Mm.

12:59.428 --> 13:01.028
Look.

13:01.096 --> 13:02.663
It's either Elaine now,

13:02.731 --> 13:05.299
or someone more acceptable
to the conservatives later.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.702
I'm talking about
your legacy, Diane.

13:07.769 --> 13:09.237
About our legacy.

13:18.213 --> 13:19.714
Russ...
I said no interruptions.

13:19.781 --> 13:22.183
He must be in the bathroom.

13:23.118 --> 13:25.052
How can I help you, boss?

13:25.120 --> 13:27.488
A very reliable source
just leaked something

13:27.556 --> 13:30.024
that's gonna help your story.

13:30.092 --> 13:32.159
On Garcetti's
pre-emptive strike?

13:32.827 --> 13:33.994
Why don't you
give it to Georgia?

13:34.062 --> 13:35.229
You're still
screwing her, right?

13:35.296 --> 13:37.164
You really want to know?
Most people show

13:37.232 --> 13:38.632
preferential treatment to
the people they screw.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.601
You do the opposite.
I find that upsetting.

13:40.668 --> 13:42.603
Garcetti's supposedly
squeezing Justice Nash

13:42.670 --> 13:44.271
off the high bench...

13:44.339 --> 13:46.039
Well, maybe Nash wants out.

13:46.107 --> 13:47.441
She's in her 70s,

13:47.508 --> 13:49.243
and her partner was just
placed in assisted care.

13:49.310 --> 13:50.711
According to the source,

13:50.778 --> 13:52.679
he wants to nominate
Elaine Barrish.

13:52.747 --> 13:54.414
Who... who's the source?

13:54.482 --> 13:55.782
High-level White House.

13:55.850 --> 13:57.284
Five hundred words by lunch.

13:57.352 --> 13:59.052
No. Wait.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.554
Let me at least get some

14:00.622 --> 14:01.989
legal scholar reaction...
Susan.

14:02.056 --> 14:03.657
The White House is going to
leak to the <i>Post</i>

14:03.725 --> 14:05.092
or the <i>Times</i> and we lose it.

14:05.159 --> 14:07.728
Give me six hours.
You have three.

14:07.795 --> 14:10.998
That kills our story,
because if she takes the gig,

14:11.065 --> 14:12.633
then she can't run.
No shit, Russ.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.234
Well, you know, breaking
a Supreme Court nod...

14:14.302 --> 14:15.402
that's not such a bad story.

14:15.470 --> 14:17.771
No. It's not <i>the</i> story.

14:17.839 --> 14:20.340
Get Elaine Barrish's
office on the line.

14:20.408 --> 14:22.910
And then we need
a sub for Douglas

14:22.977 --> 14:25.012
for the Central American Trade
meeting this afternoon

14:25.079 --> 14:26.246
at 3:00...

14:26.314 --> 14:28.348
Alice, I will call you back.

14:28.416 --> 14:29.616
Thank you.

14:30.384 --> 14:32.685
You know, I should be
used to it by now,

14:32.753 --> 14:34.420
but frankly
I was a little shocked

14:34.488 --> 14:36.255
by how negative
you were last night.

14:36.323 --> 14:37.924
What you were shocked about

14:37.992 --> 14:39.459
was that someone in this family

14:39.526 --> 14:41.260
dared to tell you the truth.

14:41.328 --> 14:43.663
Dougie doesn't have
a job without you.

14:43.731 --> 14:45.698
T.J. wants to stay
on your good side,

14:45.766 --> 14:48.368
in case he needs
a loan, or bail.

14:48.435 --> 14:49.969
And poor Anne...

14:50.037 --> 14:51.337
"Poor Anne..." what?

14:51.405 --> 14:52.605
Never mind.

14:52.673 --> 14:54.273
You know, you are so cynical.

14:54.341 --> 14:56.909
My children are actually proud
and supportive of me,

14:56.977 --> 14:58.878
as I am of them.

14:58.946 --> 15:02.015
I have been supportive of you
since the day you were born!

15:02.082 --> 15:03.583
Oh, really?

15:03.651 --> 15:05.451
Like when you made me
wear a padded bra

15:05.519 --> 15:06.886
starting in sixth grade?

15:06.954 --> 15:10.723
But those trashy Perdue twins
were maturing early.

15:10.791 --> 15:12.492
I didn't want you
to feel inferior.

15:12.559 --> 15:15.194
Well, I didn't feel inferior
until you told me I was.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.363
I never said you were inferior.

15:17.431 --> 15:18.931
You told me I was "gawky,"

15:18.999 --> 15:21.000
and that I should just
drop out of dance class

15:21.068 --> 15:23.036
because of how I
looked in a leotard.

15:23.103 --> 15:26.406
Sitting on a hard chair all day
watching you pirouette

15:26.473 --> 15:28.307
was not my idea of fun.

15:28.375 --> 15:30.710
Somehow the other mothers
managed to get through it

15:30.778 --> 15:33.112
without sucking on a flask
in front of everybody.

15:33.180 --> 15:34.747
You've never said "thank you,"
you know that?

15:34.815 --> 15:36.082
Not even once.

15:36.450 --> 15:38.217
Not even when I did
all that campaigning

15:38.285 --> 15:40.019
for you when you ran.
I have said "thank you"

15:40.087 --> 15:41.487
so many times, and...
Oh...

15:41.555 --> 15:43.622
I asked you to hold
the Bible for me

15:43.690 --> 15:45.925
when I was sworn in
as Secretary of State!

15:45.993 --> 15:47.626
Yeah, and then you
criticized my dress.

15:47.694 --> 15:49.562
It was a sequined
cocktail gown,

15:49.629 --> 15:51.998
in the middle of the afternoon.
That Bob Mackey designed!

15:52.065 --> 15:55.868
It was supposed to
be my moment, Mother.

15:55.936 --> 15:57.670
You know, this conversation
ceased to be relevant

15:57.738 --> 15:58.938
as soon as it began.

15:59.006 --> 16:00.139
You stopped me.

16:00.207 --> 16:02.308
I was innocently
getting a refill.

16:02.376 --> 16:03.576
My mistake.

16:08.181 --> 16:10.583
Yes?

16:12.552 --> 16:14.186
All right.

16:14.254 --> 16:16.522
Uh... ask her to meet me
at the office.

16:27.033 --> 16:28.834
Please tell me
this isn't the place.

16:28.902 --> 16:31.670
Why are all of Dad's friends
such ugly cultural stereotypes?

16:31.738 --> 16:33.305
Shake a leg, boys.

16:33.373 --> 16:34.773
Soon as we're done here,
we'll hit the bait store.

16:34.841 --> 16:35.941
One with a Wi-Fi hotspot, Dad?

16:36.009 --> 16:37.342
How am I supposed to coordinate

16:37.410 --> 16:40.212
the Pan-Asian economic summit...
Jubal!

16:40.280 --> 16:42.781
Hey, Jubal...

16:42.849 --> 16:45.851
Get on out here,
you old son of a bitch...

16:45.919 --> 16:50.522
Aw. Is that any way
to greet a friend?

16:50.590 --> 16:52.257
That's what you call it?

16:52.325 --> 16:53.358
Oh, shit!
Dad!

16:53.426 --> 16:55.661
Now Jubal...
Don't do nothin' dumb.

16:55.728 --> 16:57.696
All right?
See my friend Sam back there?

16:59.365 --> 17:01.767
He could part your hair with
that Sig-9 if he wanted.

17:03.002 --> 17:04.703
You got some kind of gall,

17:04.771 --> 17:08.006
showing up here on my property
after you screwed my wife!

17:08.074 --> 17:10.041
Of course he did.
Yep. Figures.

17:10.809 --> 17:12.410
That is a lie, right?

17:12.478 --> 17:14.345
That is a hurtful,
slanderous accusation.

17:14.413 --> 17:15.847
Now listen up.

17:15.915 --> 17:17.482
I didn't come here to fight.

17:17.550 --> 17:20.451
I came here to offer you
a ride on the Big Ticket.

17:20.519 --> 17:22.453
Well, too bad.
You termed-out.

17:22.521 --> 17:24.789
Not me, shithead.
My ex-wife.

17:26.025 --> 17:28.126
Elaine?
Ruing for President again?

17:28.194 --> 17:31.029
But only if you say
she can win.

17:31.096 --> 17:32.764
All right?
So do me a favor...

17:32.831 --> 17:34.465
crunch Elaine's polling numbers.

17:34.533 --> 17:36.601
Huh? Tell me if we're
chasing a dog here,

17:36.669 --> 17:39.737
or if she's got a chance at
beating Garcetti in the primary.

17:39.805 --> 17:41.940
And you don't mind
if me and the boys

17:42.007 --> 17:43.942
bunk up here for a while?

17:44.009 --> 17:45.410
We're gonna do some fishing.

17:47.246 --> 17:49.581
That's how you hook a fish.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.184
<i>When are you running it?</i>

17:54.252 --> 17:55.552
Tomorrow.

17:55.620 --> 17:57.021
But I can't guarantee

17:57.088 --> 17:58.555
it won't get leaked
elsewhere first.

17:58.623 --> 17:59.957
A Supreme Court nomination
is big news,

18:00.025 --> 18:02.993
but when it's you, it's huge.

18:03.061 --> 18:04.929
Puts you in a tight spot.

18:04.996 --> 18:07.064
If you say "yes," Garcetti
removes the threat of

18:07.132 --> 18:08.599
you running against
him in the primary.

18:08.667 --> 18:12.269
If you say "no,"
you confirm you're running...

18:12.337 --> 18:14.138
or thinking about it.

18:14.205 --> 18:16.273
Is this the part
where you ask me

18:16.341 --> 18:18.175
if I'm running
for President, Ms. Berg?

18:18.243 --> 18:19.543
Nope.

18:19.611 --> 18:21.245
Then why are you
telling me this?

18:21.313 --> 18:23.781
I owe you.

18:23.848 --> 18:27.084
And I don't approve of
what they're doing...

18:27.152 --> 18:29.720
shoving one of the greatest
Justices off the bench

18:29.788 --> 18:31.455
and using your friendship
as leverage...

18:31.523 --> 18:35.225
Even by White House standards,
it's... gross.

18:35.293 --> 18:37.661
And a little genius.

18:38.697 --> 18:40.698
Thank you for telling me this.

18:43.101 --> 18:46.303
I'll hold the story off
as long as I can, but...

18:46.371 --> 18:49.540
when this breaks,
every reporter in the world

18:49.607 --> 18:52.009
will want to know your answer.

19:00.719 --> 19:03.954
Alice, get me Justice Nash.

19:12.724 --> 19:13.891
Holy shit!

19:13.959 --> 19:15.626
I got one, I got one!
Yeah?

19:15.694 --> 19:17.395
Ah, good boy! Good boy.

19:17.462 --> 19:18.796
Now take it slow.

19:18.864 --> 19:20.731
Don't rush it, T.J. Just...
Yeah, yeah.

19:20.799 --> 19:22.133
Just reel her in, nice n' easy.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.068
That's it.

19:24.136 --> 19:25.336
What are you doing?

19:25.404 --> 19:28.339
Dad, I have a job at
the State Department.

19:28.407 --> 19:30.207
You have to learn
to unwind, Dougie.

19:30.275 --> 19:31.442
Stress is a killer.

19:31.510 --> 19:32.910
You know, even when
I was President,

19:32.978 --> 19:34.812
I always took time
to smell the roses.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.313
You remember those weekends

19:36.381 --> 19:38.082
in Camp David?

19:38.150 --> 19:41.385
The time that you boys caught
that big ole rainbow trout?

19:41.453 --> 19:43.521
I remember your press aide
handing me a fish

19:43.588 --> 19:45.856
and snapping my picture,
if that's what you mean.

19:47.993 --> 19:51.328
That's it,
just reel her right in.

19:51.396 --> 19:53.297
Good boy.

19:53.365 --> 19:55.399
Dad. The Silverton
interview is tomorrow.

19:55.467 --> 19:56.767
We need to go over
your talking points.

19:56.835 --> 19:58.369
I don't need no baby-sitter.

19:58.437 --> 20:00.538
Now, I know you were sent
down here by your Momma

20:00.605 --> 20:02.540
just because of my
"female anatomy" incident.

20:02.607 --> 20:04.975
We are at a critical juncture.
Her numbers are softening...

20:05.043 --> 20:06.777
Well, they ain't soft,
they're liquid.

20:06.845 --> 20:09.046
They're like diarrhea running
down this campaign's leg.

20:09.114 --> 20:11.082
She's off 5% with
working-class women,

20:11.149 --> 20:12.550
7% with independents...

20:14.186 --> 20:15.519
Well, I'll tell you what...

20:15.987 --> 20:18.222
you give me a lift to
the studio in the morning,

20:18.289 --> 20:20.624
we can talk lady-voters
to your heart's delight.

20:20.692 --> 20:23.293
Good night, son.

20:33.571 --> 20:34.705
Surprise!

20:34.772 --> 20:36.740
What is going on here?

20:36.808 --> 20:38.675
God, doesn't Mom ever
give you a night off?

20:38.743 --> 20:41.011
Lose the tie. It's midnight.
Get rid of them.

20:43.047 --> 20:44.448
Even me?

20:44.516 --> 20:46.049
I... I thought you were...

20:46.117 --> 20:48.352
I told my boss I was
driving up to Santa Barbara,

20:48.419 --> 20:49.553
picking up some tile

20:49.621 --> 20:50.821
for a client.

20:50.889 --> 20:52.122
I can't tell if you are

20:52.190 --> 20:54.324
happy, or...

20:59.998 --> 21:02.733
This calls for a drink.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.968
I was thinking
something stronger.

21:05.036 --> 21:07.404
Anne is not the only
surprise tonight. No.

21:07.872 --> 21:11.441
No, I'm not doing ecstasy
with you, T.J.,

21:11.509 --> 21:12.676
and neither is Anne.

21:12.743 --> 21:14.477
Okay?
Well, it's too late.

21:20.851 --> 21:22.552
How long's it last?

21:23.754 --> 21:27.223
Four, maybe five hours.

21:39.703 --> 21:41.303
♪ Booty booty booty booty

21:41.371 --> 21:42.771
♪ Booty rockin', show-stoppin'

22:00.523 --> 22:03.259
I can't believe
how wound up I was.

22:03.326 --> 22:06.562
Your skin... feels like water.

22:07.664 --> 22:09.265
Anne...
Hmm?

22:09.332 --> 22:11.433
...will you
marry me?

22:11.501 --> 22:13.736
♪ Dust it off and jerk it,

22:13.803 --> 22:16.739
Yes, yes.

22:18.275 --> 22:19.575
Yes.

22:20.377 --> 22:21.610
Whoa!

22:21.678 --> 22:23.779
Hey, I got one! Okay.

22:23.847 --> 22:26.382
Oh, shit.
Hey, can you grab it for me?

22:26.449 --> 22:27.950
Speaking.

22:28.018 --> 22:29.418
Please put him through.

22:29.486 --> 22:30.386
Forget the damn phone.

22:30.453 --> 22:31.520
Hello?
Can you hear me, Mr. Ong?

22:31.588 --> 22:32.788
I'm sorry, I seem to lost you.

22:32.856 --> 22:34.156
Did you say you can make it?

22:34.224 --> 22:36.625
You're gonna lose it, son.
You're gonna...

22:36.693 --> 22:38.794
Goddamn son of a bitch!

22:38.862 --> 22:41.263
Son, let me show you how
to tie a blood knot.

22:41.331 --> 22:42.598
I got it, okay? Just back off.

22:42.666 --> 22:44.934
You know what?
Just forget it the whole thing.

22:45.001 --> 22:47.236
I got to get a new phone.

22:47.304 --> 22:49.004
Oh, Dougie.
Sorry, man.

22:49.972 --> 22:51.906
<i>Why didn't you tell me</i>

22:51.974 --> 22:54.709
Garcetti had offered you
a golden parachute,

22:54.777 --> 22:56.644
and that I was the parachute?

22:56.712 --> 22:58.446
I didn't want
to get your hopes up.

22:58.514 --> 23:00.348
A seat on the Supreme Court,

23:00.416 --> 23:02.183
I thought you'd jump at it.

23:02.251 --> 23:04.652
Can't you see he's playing us
against each another?

23:04.720 --> 23:06.087
Of course I can.

23:06.155 --> 23:07.889
But forget about the politics
for a moment

23:07.957 --> 23:11.392
and think, consider
what you could accomplish.

23:11.460 --> 23:14.662
Why aren't we talking about what
I could accomplish as president?

23:14.730 --> 23:17.131
Oh, so it's true?

23:17.199 --> 23:19.133
I'm considering it, yes.

23:19.201 --> 23:21.035
You'll be a pariah.

23:21.503 --> 23:24.538
You remember your last campaign?

23:24.606 --> 23:27.375
They branded you
as an ambitious bitch.

23:27.442 --> 23:30.311
If I hadn't known you...

23:30.379 --> 23:31.846
I would've believed them.

23:31.913 --> 23:33.447
Do you want a president

23:33.515 --> 23:37.351
who would force a justice
like you off the bench?

23:37.419 --> 23:40.221
It's ruthless.
Elaine,

23:40.289 --> 23:42.723
these last two years have
been good for you.

23:42.791 --> 23:47.295
Garcetti may be a bastard,
but he let you do your thing;

23:47.362 --> 23:49.297
let the world see

23:49.364 --> 23:52.233
the heart of that brilliant
22-year-old girl

23:52.301 --> 23:55.202
who walked into my law class

23:55.270 --> 23:58.005
determined to make
this country a better place.

23:58.073 --> 23:59.774
If you challenge
the sitting President,

23:59.841 --> 24:02.543
voters will see your motives
as selfish.

24:03.511 --> 24:05.845
I know, it's not fair,

24:05.913 --> 24:08.481
but ambition looks better
on men.

24:08.549 --> 24:10.550
I don't care how it looks.

24:10.618 --> 24:13.653
I'm doing it
because it's right.

24:13.721 --> 24:15.222
I learned it from you.

24:15.289 --> 24:17.224
Then take my seat.

24:19.694 --> 24:22.896
This isn't Garcetti,
Elaine, it's me.

24:22.964 --> 24:24.097
Your friend.

24:24.165 --> 24:25.865
I'm offering you
the chance to spend

24:25.933 --> 24:27.434
the rest of your life
telling Presidents

24:27.501 --> 24:31.071
what they can and <i>can't</i> do.

24:38.846 --> 24:43.817
Nothing in my inbox and nothing
in your hands.

24:43.884 --> 24:45.151
Where's my story?

24:45.219 --> 24:46.886
I didn't write it.

24:46.954 --> 24:49.356
I need to talk to you.

24:49.423 --> 24:51.224
I told Barrish about the leak.

24:51.292 --> 24:52.225
You what?

24:52.293 --> 24:53.893
I needed to warn her.
Warn her?

24:53.961 --> 24:55.695
Jesus. Why,
Just, just hear me out, Alex.

24:55.763 --> 24:57.731
So you can justify meddling in
the story

24:57.798 --> 24:59.032
that you're supposed
to be covering?

24:59.100 --> 25:00.600
I mean, I should fire you...

25:00.668 --> 25:02.969
I needed to give her time
to outmaneuver Garcetti.

25:03.037 --> 25:05.739
Listen to me.
The Secretary is gonna try

25:05.806 --> 25:07.440
to unseat Garcetti in
the primary.

25:07.508 --> 25:08.441
Says who?

25:08.509 --> 25:10.477
If you say "high level" source,

25:10.544 --> 25:13.280
you can just, you can pack
your stuff right now.

25:13.347 --> 25:14.914
First-person...

25:14.982 --> 25:16.783
inside the Hammond family.

25:16.851 --> 25:18.885
This is real, Alex.

25:18.953 --> 25:21.254
Holy shit.

25:21.322 --> 25:23.056
I haven't been able
to get confirmation,

25:23.124 --> 25:24.491
but this was
the perfect opening.

25:24.558 --> 25:26.226
Tipping her off builds trust,

25:26.294 --> 25:28.194
puts me deeper in
the inner circle,

25:28.762 --> 25:32.899
and gives me a front seat to the
political story of the decade.

25:32.966 --> 25:35.001
Unless she takes
the spot on the court.

25:35.068 --> 25:36.502
Which... she won't.

25:36.570 --> 25:37.637
Right.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.206
Because you're just like her.

25:40.274 --> 25:43.476
This explains why you haven't
filed in two weeks,

25:43.544 --> 25:46.646
and why you like you've been
sleeping in a ditch.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.014
What is, what is this?

25:48.081 --> 25:50.349
Chocolate pudding, I hope.

25:50.417 --> 25:54.120
I'm crashing on my sister's
couch since we split.

25:54.188 --> 25:56.322
You must love that.

25:56.390 --> 25:58.791
Mm. I tripped over
a Big Wheel on my way

25:58.859 --> 26:00.526
to the bathroom last night.

26:00.594 --> 26:03.996
Why don't you come over tonight,
let me cook you dinner?

26:04.064 --> 26:05.798
Alex...

26:05.866 --> 26:07.800
I miss you, Susan.

26:07.868 --> 26:10.636
Just...

26:10.704 --> 26:12.471
shut up.

26:24.108 --> 26:25.975
How about a little
"Words With Friends?"

26:26.043 --> 26:28.344
I'd love to, but my phone
went for a swim in the river.

26:28.412 --> 26:30.079
Where's T.J.?

26:30.147 --> 26:33.683
He's out cleaning
the fish, I think.

26:47.364 --> 26:49.432
Oh, shit.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.566
Baby, what's wrong?

26:50.634 --> 26:52.668
Oh, no. No, no.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.604
No-no-no-no-no-no.

26:57.007 --> 26:58.508
Excuse me.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.176
President Hammond,

27:00.244 --> 27:02.211
although you have denied
your wife's difficulty

27:02.279 --> 27:03.913
with women voters, do you think
this controversy

27:03.981 --> 27:05.581
might have to do with you?

27:05.649 --> 27:08.017
Is it possible that many women
don't respect your wife

27:08.085 --> 27:10.653
because you haven't respected
her?

27:10.721 --> 27:15.558
Rachel, I admit I was wrong.

27:15.626 --> 27:17.827
Elaine does have
a "woman problem".

27:18.595 --> 27:20.929
I think some girls feel
threatened by a woman

27:20.997 --> 27:23.899
as intelligent, as accomplished
and hell, yeah,

27:23.967 --> 27:25.567
as beautiful as my wife.

27:25.635 --> 27:28.203
And that's why they feel
more comfortable voting

27:28.271 --> 27:31.306
for her rival, who's inferior in
every single way...

27:31.374 --> 27:35.177
just because he has a
pretty head of hair and a penis.

27:36.813 --> 27:39.148
Yeah, you heard me right.

27:39.215 --> 27:40.616
I said "penis."

27:40.683 --> 27:41.583
Sorry, man.

27:41.651 --> 27:43.085
<i>Great. You know what?</i>

27:43.153 --> 27:44.887
You just cost us California!

27:44.954 --> 27:46.355
There isn't a chance
in hell now

27:46.422 --> 27:48.791
that anyone with an ounce of
estrogen is gonna vote for Mom.

27:48.858 --> 27:50.526
Oh, <i>now</i> you weigh in,
my no-show handler?

27:50.593 --> 27:52.227
Why didn't you tell me
she was lesbian?

27:52.295 --> 27:53.395
She isn't.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.330
But she sure seemed
like one to me.

27:55.398 --> 27:57.132
You know what?
You can't stand

27:57.200 --> 27:59.768
that Garcetti might replace
you as the face of this party,

27:59.836 --> 28:01.937
so you and your massive ego
are destroying this campaign!

28:02.005 --> 28:04.439
I never needed you
to look after me, Douglas,

28:04.507 --> 28:06.341
but it'd be nice
if you'd been man enough

28:06.409 --> 28:08.510
to save your mother
from this train wreck!

28:09.078 --> 28:11.246
She deserved a bold, earth-shaking,
barnstorming campaign

28:11.314 --> 28:13.782
that redefined politics and
galvanized the nation!

28:13.849 --> 28:15.383
And what did she get?

28:15.451 --> 28:19.321
A reheated, poll-tested
shit sandwich served up

28:19.388 --> 28:20.855
by the likes of Barry Harris.

28:20.923 --> 28:23.591
And you stood right
by and let him.

28:23.659 --> 28:26.895
Go ahead, blame me.

28:26.962 --> 28:29.764
Blame me for everything
like you always do.

28:39.942 --> 28:41.709
I'm gonna go find T.J.

28:41.777 --> 28:43.544
I'm sure he's fine.

28:43.612 --> 28:45.880
You don't need to babysit him.

29:03.131 --> 29:04.898
You're smoking.

29:04.966 --> 29:06.400
Uh-oh.

29:06.467 --> 29:08.969
What country isn't going
to exist by morning?

29:09.037 --> 29:12.706
Or are you celebrating your
Supreme Court offer?

29:12.774 --> 29:14.408
Feel free to come
to the State Department

29:14.475 --> 29:16.009
and eavesdrop there as well.

29:16.077 --> 29:19.046
You know, you keep talking
about Diane Nast this

29:19.113 --> 29:21.048
and Diane Nash that.

29:21.115 --> 29:24.618
I don't know.
She seems like a real downer to me.

29:24.686 --> 29:26.086
Her partner is dying, Mother.

29:26.154 --> 29:27.754
No, I was talking about
the way she dumped

29:27.822 --> 29:30.557
all over your plans
for becoming President.

29:30.625 --> 29:31.958
Didn't you dump on them first?

29:32.026 --> 29:33.493
A campaign would just
turn everything

29:33.561 --> 29:35.429
all upside down around here.

29:35.496 --> 29:38.231
That's why I said what I did.

29:38.299 --> 29:42.736
But you're never
satisfied, sweetie.

29:42.804 --> 29:44.504
And even though you hate all

29:44.572 --> 29:46.339
that campaign bullshit
as much as I do,

29:46.407 --> 29:49.676
you'd be miserable if
you didn't go for it.

29:49.744 --> 29:52.079
And when you're miserable,
we're all miserable.

29:52.146 --> 29:55.415
So I think we should
just bite the bullet

29:55.483 --> 29:57.317
and you should go for it.

29:59.120 --> 30:02.522
Besides, you look shitty
in all black.

30:05.159 --> 30:07.227
Mom...
Hmm?

30:08.496 --> 30:10.130
I love your pep talks.

30:10.198 --> 30:11.965
Yeah, well.

30:21.408 --> 30:22.108
T.J.?

30:22.175 --> 30:24.343
Cleaning fish, huh?

30:25.712 --> 30:27.480
We had a deal.
We had a deal.

30:27.548 --> 30:29.549
You can't even go one day

30:29.616 --> 30:30.917
Stop!
Without getting high?

30:30.984 --> 30:34.287
Hold on, hold on. It's Dad
and this fricking place.

30:34.354 --> 30:36.222
I-I should be home working
on the club opening,

30:36.290 --> 30:38.024
but I came
because you wanted me to.

30:38.091 --> 30:39.692
I just, I needed something
to take the edge off.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.328
Okay? I'm sorry.
I know I messed up.

30:42.396 --> 30:45.131
Don't pull that shit
with me. Not today.

30:45.198 --> 30:47.433
Drop the goddamn act.

30:47.501 --> 30:50.570
Just don't tell Mom and Dad,
okay?

30:50.637 --> 30:51.938
You're worried about them?

30:52.005 --> 30:53.906
Why about me?
I gave you the money.

30:53.974 --> 30:56.609
Douglas...

30:56.677 --> 31:00.079
please.

31:00.147 --> 31:01.914
Get out of here.

31:01.982 --> 31:04.383
We'll discuss my investment
when you're sober.

31:10.490 --> 31:11.490
Hey!

31:11.558 --> 31:13.859
Told ya he was fine.

31:13.927 --> 31:15.861
Sure, yeah, he's great.

31:16.229 --> 31:18.097
And you didn't
screw Jubal's wife.

31:18.164 --> 31:19.832
How many times I have
to say it?

31:19.900 --> 31:22.568
I did not touch that woman.

31:22.636 --> 31:24.703
I know, Dad.
That's your genius.

31:24.771 --> 31:26.772
It's not a lie
if you believe it.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.274
Well, if you want
to convince yourself

31:28.341 --> 31:30.376
that you're not a cheater, hmm?

31:30.443 --> 31:31.944
That Mom can upset Garcetti,
that T.J.

31:32.012 --> 31:33.779
is just fine,
well, you go right ahead.

31:34.247 --> 31:35.981
You know what
your problem is, Dougie?

31:36.049 --> 31:38.016
You don't have
any faith in people.

31:38.084 --> 31:40.619
I don't need to take character
advice from you.

31:40.687 --> 31:44.022
What's this really about, son?

31:44.090 --> 31:46.158
Now what's your beef with me?!

31:46.225 --> 31:49.027
Come on.
Spit it out.

31:49.095 --> 31:51.029
It's not my fault!

31:52.665 --> 31:54.833
It is not my fault
that she lost!

31:54.901 --> 31:57.836
Yeah, I know. I know, son.

31:57.904 --> 31:58.870
I did everything.

31:58.938 --> 32:00.772
I wanted her to win so bad!

32:00.840 --> 32:03.041
I did everything I could!

32:03.109 --> 32:05.677
I know you did, son,
and she knows it, too.

32:05.745 --> 32:08.046
You, you lost it
for her, not me!

32:09.382 --> 32:13.051
Yeah... I know.

32:13.119 --> 32:15.420
I know I did.

32:35.593 --> 32:37.227
I should, uh...

32:37.294 --> 32:39.929
Hey, slow down. Slow down.

32:39.997 --> 32:43.133
We can have dinner here,
and then, um,

32:43.200 --> 32:45.802
if you feel like it,
you can stay here tonight.

32:45.870 --> 32:47.904
No big wheels to trip over.

32:49.206 --> 32:51.341
There's plenty here
to trip over.

32:53.577 --> 32:55.812
Besides...

32:56.380 --> 32:58.748
I'll get out in time
for you to call Georgia.

32:59.816 --> 33:02.518
That was meant to be a joke.

33:06.056 --> 33:07.623
You're not saying that you'll

33:07.691 --> 33:11.227
get back with me
if I split with her.

33:11.295 --> 33:12.662
No.

33:12.729 --> 33:14.897
Definitely not saying that.

33:18.669 --> 33:21.437
Why Georgia?

33:24.140 --> 33:25.674
Was it to hurt me?

33:25.742 --> 33:27.476
No.

33:27.544 --> 33:29.044
By the time I slept with her,

33:29.112 --> 33:32.214
you and I had, uh, faded.

33:33.583 --> 33:34.950
You remember
our first night in Monterey?

33:35.018 --> 33:36.451
Yeah.

33:36.519 --> 33:38.554
The night Garcetti
named his transition team.

33:38.621 --> 33:40.455
Yes.

33:42.224 --> 33:44.726
You see, you remember
the politics,

33:44.794 --> 33:46.928
and I remember
how beautiful you looked.

33:46.996 --> 33:49.664
Even with your nose
buried in your BlackBerry.

33:49.732 --> 33:51.666
I'm not blaming you.

33:51.734 --> 33:53.835
I'm trying
to answer your question.

33:55.838 --> 33:58.173
It's who you are--
the way you chase a story.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.874
I mean, that's...
you live for it.

33:59.942 --> 34:03.511
You don't need love
the way you need your work.

34:03.579 --> 34:06.614
At least you didn't need mine.

34:12.020 --> 34:14.088
Do you remember my first
moot court competition?

34:14.156 --> 34:16.690
I was the only first-year
you chose.

34:16.757 --> 34:18.993
I thought I was pretty hot shit.

34:19.061 --> 34:20.761
And then you proceeded
to eviscerate

34:20.829 --> 34:23.397
my argument word by word.

34:23.465 --> 34:25.833
I had so much flop sweat,

34:25.900 --> 34:28.034
I... I thought
I was going to float away.

34:28.103 --> 34:30.603
I was extra hard on you.

34:30.672 --> 34:33.474
I wanted you to learn
to be rigorous and brave

34:33.542 --> 34:35.376
and not to give up.

34:35.444 --> 34:37.110
It was a good lesson.

34:37.179 --> 34:40.313
I came back the next year,
and we beat Harvard and Yale.

34:40.382 --> 34:42.850
Hmm.

34:42.918 --> 34:45.753
Diane, I don't want to be
on the Supreme Court.

34:45.821 --> 34:47.822
I want to run
for president again.

34:47.889 --> 34:50.190
All right, counselor.

34:50.257 --> 34:53.893
Convince me
that you're not doing this

34:53.962 --> 34:56.697
because this is still
a competition to you

34:56.764 --> 34:58.999
and you didn't come in first.

34:59.067 --> 35:02.269
It's different this time.

35:02.337 --> 35:04.972
I can't turn away
'cause it's hard.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.942
I can't turn away
because it'll piss people off.

35:08.809 --> 35:10.744
I do have deep convictions

35:10.811 --> 35:12.913
about what's right
and what's true.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.381
And, unfortunately,
Paul Garcetti

35:14.448 --> 35:16.249
did not have you for a teacher,

35:16.317 --> 35:18.718
and he didn't learn
to be rigous or brave

35:18.786 --> 35:20.620
or to stand up
for his convictions.

35:22.089 --> 35:24.491
So I have to run again.

35:24.559 --> 35:28.094
And yes, I have to win.

35:29.530 --> 35:33.366
In two years,
when I become president,

35:33.434 --> 35:35.569
I will name your replacement.

35:35.636 --> 35:38.772
Corinne will be gone
in two years.

35:42.276 --> 35:45.145
You better win, Elaine.

36:02.029 --> 36:03.296
<i>Elaine can win.</i>

36:03.364 --> 36:04.497
<i>She can win.</i>

36:04.565 --> 36:05.765
Your mother's lead

36:05.833 --> 36:07.567
is beyond the margin
most everywhere.

36:07.635 --> 36:09.869
The whole ticket comes down
to just three states:

36:09.937 --> 36:13.473
Ohio, Colorado
and right here, Virginia.

36:13.541 --> 36:16.643
And Virginia,
like the other two,

36:16.711 --> 36:18.645
hinges on just a few
battleground counties.

36:18.713 --> 36:20.647
Prince William,
Fairfax, Madison.

36:20.715 --> 36:22.248
That's my backyard.

36:22.316 --> 36:24.417
I'll tie this state up
in a nice, pretty bow.

36:24.485 --> 36:27.854
But Ohio is going to be tough.

36:28.422 --> 36:30.256
Now, the whole family
have to press the flesh

36:30.324 --> 36:31.524
in the old Buckeye State.

36:31.592 --> 36:32.792
Uh, not the whole family, Bud.

36:34.194 --> 36:38.297
Uh, voters only
like her without you.

36:38.365 --> 36:40.633
It's not that they
don't like you.

36:40.701 --> 36:43.536
It's just that they think
you make her look weak.

36:49.443 --> 36:51.444
Well...

36:51.512 --> 36:55.214
well, any way you slice it,
this is great news.

36:57.050 --> 36:59.418
I'm going to get me
a beer on the porch.

36:59.486 --> 37:01.888
This calls for a toast.

37:13.834 --> 37:16.235
Jesus.

37:16.803 --> 37:18.671
Did you see his face?

37:18.738 --> 37:20.806
Don't fall for it, T.J.
He brought this on himself.

37:20.874 --> 37:24.109
Your father would crawl
through glass for your mother.

37:24.177 --> 37:26.111
My father is a liability--

37:26.179 --> 37:28.347
in case you forgot
the last election.

37:28.415 --> 37:30.215
You mean California?

37:30.283 --> 37:33.385
A week before the primary,
it wasn't even close.

37:33.453 --> 37:36.422
Those debates
killed your mother.

37:36.489 --> 37:38.824
If she sat on her hands,
she came off timid.

37:38.892 --> 37:41.126
If she punched back,
she came off like a bitch.

37:41.194 --> 37:42.561
That's the reason Bud called

37:42.629 --> 37:45.130
and said to end things
before they got ugly.

37:45.198 --> 37:48.000
Your father threw himself
on the tracks.

37:49.235 --> 37:51.036
Yeah, he knew,

37:51.104 --> 37:54.139
if he took the heat
for her losing,

37:54.207 --> 37:57.876
he might give her the chance
to run again someday.

38:11.891 --> 38:14.560
Why didn't you tell me

38:14.627 --> 38:17.730
about the
Rachel Silverton interview?

38:17.797 --> 38:19.364
You did all of it on purpose.

38:19.432 --> 38:20.733
You let the country blame you.

38:20.800 --> 38:23.435
You let me blame you.

38:23.503 --> 38:24.770
Jubal said...

38:24.838 --> 38:26.338
Well, Jubal doesn't know shit,

38:26.406 --> 38:28.373
except when it
comes to polling.

38:28.441 --> 38:31.043
And if he says I can't be
on your mother's campaign,

38:31.111 --> 38:33.879
that means you're
going to quarterback.

38:33.947 --> 38:36.749
Now, the first thing
you got to do...

38:36.816 --> 38:38.951
We need to put together
a war chest.

38:39.018 --> 38:40.719
On the sly, all right?

38:40.787 --> 38:43.088
We need donors we can trust.

38:43.656 --> 38:45.290
That's right, and you be sure

38:45.358 --> 38:47.959
to get in touch with
Hal Linderson in Colorado.

38:48.027 --> 38:50.795
Now, you tell him
you want a sit-down,

38:50.863 --> 38:52.464
but you don't say why.

38:52.531 --> 38:53.732
What about Virginia?

38:53.799 --> 38:55.433
We'll need you to max out

38:55.501 --> 38:57.902
contributions to Bertoldo's
campaign in the fifth.

38:57.970 --> 38:59.137
Discretely.

38:59.205 --> 39:00.605
Use our own Italian wunderkind

39:00.673 --> 39:02.140
to upset Garcetti's hold
on the Catholics.

39:18.399 --> 39:19.800
First rule of being
a female journalist.

39:19.867 --> 39:21.802
Don't sleep with your boss?

39:21.869 --> 39:23.570
Look, I get it, okay?

39:23.638 --> 39:25.839
No. If you shit where you eat,
don't cry about it.

39:25.907 --> 39:28.041
Like I can help it.
Learn to.

39:28.109 --> 39:30.310
Nobody takes me seriously.

39:30.378 --> 39:31.611
You want to be taken seriously?

39:31.679 --> 39:33.079
Take yourself seriously.

39:33.147 --> 39:35.315
Your bus story-- it's good.

39:35.383 --> 39:37.284
Go fight for it, get it back,

39:37.351 --> 39:38.819
then write the hell out of it.

39:38.886 --> 39:41.021
Don't let anyone
take away your story.

39:41.088 --> 39:43.723
Especially if you're
blowing him.

39:43.791 --> 39:46.293
Thank you.

39:46.360 --> 39:49.262
After everything
I've done to you...

39:49.330 --> 39:51.832
I can't believe
you're still so nice to me.

39:53.067 --> 39:55.091
I'm not so nice, Georgia.

39:55.136 --> 39:56.976
Justice
Diane Nash dismissed rumors

39:57.079 --> 39:59.315
of her retirement today,
releasing a statement

39:59.400 --> 40:00.640
that she "fully intends

40:00.775 --> 40:02.693
to continue serving
on the Supreme Court."

40:06.814 --> 40:09.048
Hi. Um, I have Secretary
Barrish on your phone,

40:09.116 --> 40:11.050
so it's probably a prank,
but then maybe it's not,

40:11.118 --> 40:12.685
so I don't really
know what to do.

40:12.753 --> 40:14.954
I don't know if I should
tell her to come up

40:15.022 --> 40:16.689
or give her water
or something like that.

40:23.130 --> 40:24.430
Hi.
Hi.

40:24.498 --> 40:25.665
Brought you something.

40:25.732 --> 40:27.033
Thank you.

40:27.101 --> 40:28.835
I just wanted to
thank you in person.

40:28.902 --> 40:30.770
You stuck your neck out for me,

40:30.838 --> 40:32.872
and that is a rare
gesture in this town.

40:34.441 --> 40:36.242
You know, it's, um...

40:36.310 --> 40:39.412
it's hard to make new
acquaintances in Washington.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.582
You know, to meet
people you can trust.

40:42.649 --> 40:44.484
And for some reason,
it's even harder

40:44.551 --> 40:46.752
with other women, although
it always seemed to me

40:46.820 --> 40:48.154
it should be the
opposite, right?

40:48.222 --> 40:50.156
Yeah.
Anyway,

40:50.224 --> 40:53.059
I wondered if you'd like to
join me for a walk tomorrow.

40:53.127 --> 40:55.061
Like, one of your
famous power walks?

40:55.129 --> 40:56.395
Well, it's just a walk really,

40:56.463 --> 40:58.931
but, um...
is that a yes?

40:58.999 --> 41:00.466
Sure.

41:00.534 --> 41:01.901
Good.

41:01.969 --> 41:03.703
That'll give us a
chance to catch up

41:03.770 --> 41:06.072
before I go to Harbin.
Where's Harbin?

41:06.640 --> 41:10.309
It's in this lovely, remote
province in northern China,

41:10.377 --> 41:14.346
where they have this large
population of Siberian tigers.

41:14.414 --> 41:16.915
He's literally sending
you to Siberia. He is.

41:16.983 --> 41:22.187
And to Indonesia, Japan,
Argentina and New Zealand.

41:22.255 --> 41:23.422
That is so...

41:23.490 --> 41:24.823
"Predictable,"

41:24.891 --> 41:28.027
I think, is the word
you're looking for.

41:28.094 --> 41:30.195
Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.

41:30.263 --> 41:31.563
Madam Secretary.

41:31.631 --> 41:32.831
Oh.

41:32.899 --> 41:34.133
Far too cumbersome.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.434
Elaine.

41:36.870 --> 41:39.605
Just so we're clear...

41:39.673 --> 41:41.607
if my acquaintance
were running for president

41:41.675 --> 41:43.375
and I didn't write
about it first,

41:43.443 --> 41:44.743
no one in this building

41:44.811 --> 41:46.378
will ever take me
seriously again.

41:49.315 --> 41:51.549
I am not running for president.

41:53.719 --> 41:56.521
But I am looking forward to
spending more time together.

41:56.589 --> 41:59.290
So am I... Elaine.

42:24.483 --> 42:26.684
We keep meeting like this,
people are going to talk.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.419
You can't print the story.

42:28.487 --> 42:30.522
I thought you wanted
to put a bullet

42:30.589 --> 42:31.956
in your mother's campaign.

42:32.024 --> 42:33.358
Things have changed.

42:33.425 --> 42:35.593
Look, you have to drop it.

42:35.661 --> 42:38.162
I'll owe you big-time, I know.

42:38.230 --> 42:40.164
Relax.

42:40.232 --> 42:42.300
I was planning on holding it.

42:44.937 --> 42:47.539
Till the day she announces.

42:47.606 --> 42:49.874
Then I give the whole story.

42:49.942 --> 42:51.109
Every step.

42:51.176 --> 42:52.410
Every move she made

42:52.478 --> 42:54.178
while she was the sitting
secretary of state

42:54.246 --> 42:55.914
to plot her run in the primary

42:55.981 --> 42:57.549
against her boss
and former ally,

42:57.616 --> 42:59.317
the president
of the United States.

42:59.585 --> 43:01.652
This is how it works, Douglas.

43:01.720 --> 43:04.789
I help you by sitting
on the story.

43:04.857 --> 43:08.292
You help me by giving me
everything I need to know

43:08.360 --> 43:09.827
about your mother's plan:

43:09.895 --> 43:12.330
Strategy, money,
allies, everything.

43:13.932 --> 43:15.433
You came to me, Douglas.

43:15.501 --> 43:17.135
Remember?

43:17.202 --> 43:19.470
I'm happy to keep your name
out of my reporting,

43:19.538 --> 43:21.506
but I own you now.

43:22.641 --> 43:24.308
We'll be in touch.
