WEBVTT

00:01.047 --> 00:02.528
Hawkes, we need cover!

00:02.871 --> 00:04.148
No!

00:04.272 --> 00:05.952
Why do you feel
as though you can control

00:05.953 --> 00:06.793
what other people do?

00:08.074 --> 00:10.068
Now I will take the pain away.

00:12.439 --> 00:14.397
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are now prisoners

00:14.517 --> 00:16.219
of the Pakistani Navy.

00:20.481 --> 00:22.531
- Paul!
- You saved me.

00:22.999 --> 00:23.866
Go.

00:25.390 --> 00:26.590
- Christine!
- Sam!

00:26.707 --> 00:27.587
Where you taking her?!

00:27.691 --> 00:29.513
No! You are no good
to her dead. Come on!

00:29.626 --> 00:32.026
I'm gonna need the Colorado
to get me through the blockade.

00:32.027 --> 00:34.202
They've taken her somewhere,
and I'm gonna find her.

Three days, four at most.

00:47.507 --> 00:48.587
If it takes a week, then...

00:48.588 --> 00:50.198
- It won't take a week.
- It can't.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.729
Now you owe me nothing, Sam,
and you never have.

00:56.835 --> 00:58.089
You understand what I'm saying?

01:04.056 --> 01:05.612
Bring her home safe.

Come on, Bullfrog.
Don't be that guy.

01:26.636 --> 01:27.987
King?

01:29.440 --> 01:30.588
Damn, son.

01:30.717 --> 01:32.963
I figured you for shark chum by now.

01:33.069 --> 01:34.169
Easy, man.

01:34.276 --> 01:34.956
Oh, that's right.

01:34.999 --> 01:36.731
I forgot what
a delicate flower you are.

01:36.831 --> 01:38.257
You know, your friend...

01:39.474 --> 01:40.959
Come on inside.

01:46.653 --> 01:48.587
So this is what you left the party for?

01:48.693 --> 01:50.363
It's, uh, great.

01:50.649 --> 01:51.689
Well, it beats that Mark V

01:51.826 --> 01:53.715
we spent eight days on in the Gulf.

01:53.812 --> 01:55.024
No.

01:55.318 --> 01:57.236
This is why I left the party.

01:57.913 --> 01:59.233
Wes, my friend here...

01:59.322 --> 02:00.832
Hold on a second, okay?

02:01.002 --> 02:03.605
Sweetie, can you take Charlie
for a walk?

02:03.719 --> 02:05.319
That okay with you, kid?
You want to go

02:05.320 --> 02:07.200
to the park with your mom,
get some ice cream?

02:09.477 --> 02:10.834
It's okay.

02:14.414 --> 02:16.860
I mean, what the hell are you
thinking, bringing him here?

02:16.964 --> 02:17.751
- Listen...
- Huh?

02:17.851 --> 02:18.821
I know it's a big ask.

02:18.961 --> 02:20.681
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't important.

02:20.798 --> 02:22.718
We need some information,
and then we are gone.

02:22.719 --> 02:23.920
You have got to be kidding me.

02:24.006 --> 02:26.046
You do know you're public
enemy number two, right?

02:26.047 --> 02:26.567
Yes, I do.

02:26.669 --> 02:28.603
And you come to my house
in broad daylight.

02:28.718 --> 02:30.278
Now you want me to open up old sources?

02:30.322 --> 02:31.897
They've got my wife.

02:32.305 --> 02:33.585
She was renditioned two days ago

02:33.586 --> 02:35.026
off the the island of Sainte Marina.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.400
Manila's the closest way station.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.208
Yeah, that's right.

02:37.299 --> 02:38.419
We don't have a lot of time.

02:38.420 --> 02:40.217
Wait. Hold on a second.
Two days ago?

02:40.218 --> 02:41.898
Look, I'm sorry, man.
She's already gone.

02:41.899 --> 02:43.299
Oh, no.
Don't... don't... don't...

02:43.300 --> 02:44.963
don't tell me she's gone.
She's not gone.

02:44.981 --> 02:46.284
Rendition like this usually takes

02:46.285 --> 02:47.925
at least three days
to arrange transfer.

02:47.926 --> 02:50.086
That means I got about 12 hours
before they throw her

02:50.087 --> 02:51.715
in some hole somewhere.
You understand me?

02:51.734 --> 02:53.396
- Yeah. Well, good luck with that.
- Hey.

02:53.397 --> 02:54.597
I suggest you tell your friend

02:54.598 --> 02:55.798
to take his damn hands off me.

02:55.799 --> 02:57.519
I'm sorry if this is
inconvenient for you,

02:57.520 --> 02:58.838
but they got my wife.

02:59.395 --> 03:00.275
So if you can help us,

03:00.276 --> 03:02.156
I don't have the luxury
of letting you say no.

03:02.222 --> 03:03.422
- I have a wife, too.
- Okay.

03:03.423 --> 03:04.703
Okay? And a kid
on top of that.

03:04.759 --> 03:06.498
Anybody find out I made
contact with you,

03:06.629 --> 03:08.420
I am back on the grid.

03:09.061 --> 03:12.054
I'm just trying to protect
my family, same as you.

03:23.843 --> 03:25.940
You really stole a US boomer?

03:27.385 --> 03:29.308
It sort of just happened, yeah.

03:34.987 --> 03:36.269
Okay.

03:37.258 --> 03:38.584
Just... look...

03:38.696 --> 03:41.628
You're gonna need 10K for bribes.

03:41.734 --> 03:45.158
And then there's cash for
access, equipment, extraction.

03:45.289 --> 03:47.809
I mean, I'm guessing you guys
don't have 50 bucks between you.

03:47.848 --> 03:49.968
Yeah, you'd be surprised
what I can get my hands on.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.319
You. Move the crates.

03:58.424 --> 03:59.482
Let's go.

04:00.773 --> 04:02.490
What do you want from me?

04:02.596 --> 04:04.140
Me? I don't want anything.

04:04.246 --> 04:05.637
I'm just a baggage handler.

04:05.755 --> 04:07.047
You work for the government.

04:07.151 --> 04:08.311
They pay me,

04:08.558 --> 04:10.489
but I wouldn't say I work for 'em.

04:10.954 --> 04:11.665
Here.

04:11.772 --> 04:14.024
Get cleaned up before the transfer.

04:14.575 --> 04:16.012
Transfer to where?

04:16.124 --> 04:17.512
Above my pay grade.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.945
Once you're out of this building,

04:18.946 --> 04:20.185
you're somebody else's problem.

04:20.255 --> 04:21.741
Do you even know who I am?

04:21.846 --> 04:23.232
I watch the news.

04:23.399 --> 04:24.695
Six hours.

04:24.948 --> 04:26.576
You leave in six hours.

04:40.699 --> 04:42.424
Captain Marcus Chaplin is here now.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.095
Captain Marcus Chaplin,

04:45.288 --> 04:46.654
I am Zheng Li, special envoy

04:46.795 --> 04:48.512
from the People's Republic of China.

04:48.684 --> 04:50.880
It is China's understanding
that the current embargo

04:51.035 --> 04:53.600
has eradicated your food
and medical supplies.

04:53.718 --> 04:55.238
The government of China considers this

04:55.334 --> 04:56.657
a humanitarian crisis,

04:56.822 --> 04:58.539
and I wish to come to your shores.

04:58.651 --> 05:00.301
Trojan horse?

05:00.517 --> 05:02.245
We have to assume so.

05:03.394 --> 05:06.561
Permission to come ashore
granted, Mr. Zheng.

05:10.275 --> 05:12.341
US vessels not engaging.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.292
So maybe the blockade isn't a blockade

05:14.403 --> 05:16.102
if a country like China says it isn't.

05:16.210 --> 05:18.775
Grace, organize a contingent
to greet Mr. Zheng.

05:18.895 --> 05:20.933
They may come in peace,
but let's be prepared.

05:21.019 --> 05:22.232
Yes, sir.

05:55.142 --> 05:56.687
He'll bow slightly,

05:56.819 --> 05:58.190
and then you'll shake hands.

05:58.303 --> 05:59.603
End of meeting.

06:00.266 --> 06:00.982
Sorry, sir.

06:01.096 --> 06:03.704
I learned it from my dad
when he was an envoy in China.

06:03.804 --> 06:05.636
I wasn't sure you knew the protocol.

06:19.751 --> 06:21.172
Welcome to Sainte Marina.

06:21.281 --> 06:24.457
Thank you, Captain.
I'm very pleased to be here.

06:24.575 --> 06:26.144
You have a beautiful island.

06:26.522 --> 06:27.546
Please.

06:50.972 --> 06:52.335
Hawkes?

06:59.215 --> 07:00.883
One moment.

07:10.218 --> 07:11.988
My sister's dead.

07:12.603 --> 07:13.617
Yes.

07:14.075 --> 07:15.316
I'm sorry.

07:15.922 --> 07:17.189
I'm a deserter.

07:17.302 --> 07:19.382
I left the Lieutenant
in the middle of a firefight.

07:19.512 --> 07:21.712
You're gonna arrest me
and strip me of my rank, right?

07:21.713 --> 07:23.673
So why are you even bothering
to talk about her?

07:27.013 --> 07:28.651
Because I'm truly sorry she's dead.

07:28.807 --> 07:30.720
Don't act like you care about her, man.

07:30.869 --> 07:32.086
Don't do that.

07:33.779 --> 07:35.273
I'm going.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.200
Petty Officer Hawkes, stop.

07:39.339 --> 07:41.060
Son, I'm sorry.

07:42.275 --> 07:44.114
But you are charged with desertion

07:44.216 --> 07:45.994
and conduct unbecoming.

07:47.605 --> 07:48.643
Petty Officer Brannan.

07:48.758 --> 07:50.204
- Sir.
- Arrest this man.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.540
What's your name?

08:16.946 --> 08:18.128
Charlie.

08:18.564 --> 08:20.691
That was my dad's dad's name.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.291
I never met him.

08:26.657 --> 08:27.974
Say, Charlie.

08:28.087 --> 08:29.587
Play now with your friends.

08:29.687 --> 08:30.708
Okay.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.110
Good job, kid.

08:43.676 --> 08:45.532
How long have you been married?

08:45.662 --> 08:47.719
Uh, two years.
We've been married two years.

08:47.720 --> 08:50.000
But I've been away most of
the time we've been together.

08:50.125 --> 08:51.925
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah, that's the life of a sailor.

08:51.926 --> 08:53.366
That's one of the reasons I got out.

08:54.090 --> 08:55.650
I mean, God knows, it hasn't been easy,

08:55.651 --> 08:57.945
but... but every time
I look at her...

08:58.912 --> 09:00.903
I know it was worth it.

09:11.507 --> 09:12.629
How'd you guys meet?

09:15.840 --> 09:16.855
I was at a Navy bar

09:16.976 --> 09:18.376
with some guys out of Miramar.

09:18.476 --> 09:21.454
This group of USD students
come in. Big guys.

09:21.549 --> 09:22.869
The minute they walk in the door,

09:22.870 --> 09:24.550
you just... you know
it's gonna go wrong.

09:25.001 --> 09:27.142
And they got this, uh,
they got this girl with 'em.

09:29.047 --> 09:31.670
And I just...
I can't stop staring at her.

09:32.118 --> 09:33.470
Of course, it does go wrong.

09:33.586 --> 09:36.947
You know... people yelling,
throwing punches.

09:37.385 --> 09:39.185
In the middle of it,
I walk right up to her,

09:39.186 --> 09:41.141
and I say, "hi, I'm Sam.
Sam Kendal."

09:41.269 --> 09:43.041
And she stops me.

09:43.158 --> 09:44.671
And she says, "yes."

09:45.889 --> 09:47.996
"Yes, Sam Kendal,
I'd love to."

09:48.404 --> 09:51.019
Oh.
That's pretty good, that.

09:51.823 --> 09:54.267
You know, she didn't ask
for any of this.

09:55.284 --> 09:56.863
I mean, marrying me,

09:56.995 --> 09:59.632
she's been... been dragged
halfway around the world,

09:59.788 --> 10:01.171
kidnapped,

10:02.168 --> 10:04.058
scared out of her mind.

10:06.019 --> 10:07.266
Look, Sam, I...

10:08.046 --> 10:09.408
I said I'd get into this.

10:09.490 --> 10:10.956
I mean, I'll set up a meet.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.428
But you gotta do something for me.

10:12.490 --> 10:13.616
You gotta promise me

10:13.732 --> 10:16.383
that if this thing
goes sideways, you get caught,

10:17.234 --> 10:18.835
you were never here.

10:18.945 --> 10:20.456
I promise.

10:21.951 --> 10:23.252
Christine Kendal.

10:23.392 --> 10:26.822
Somewhere between Sainte Marina
and Sydney, she disappeared.

10:27.009 --> 10:28.209
No, not "got lost."

10:28.316 --> 10:31.784
Disappeared,
as in "Black Bag Disappeared."

10:32.182 --> 10:34.831
Oh. Oh, now you're just gonna
lie to my face?

10:34.959 --> 10:37.450
She was on the boat,
you son of a bitch.

10:44.327 --> 10:45.831
Caroline, hi.

10:45.943 --> 10:47.802
I just got off the phone
with Bill Simms,

10:47.910 --> 10:50.170
who you're gonna fire
by the end of the day.

10:50.295 --> 10:52.687
So I'm trying to track down
a passenger...

10:53.116 --> 10:54.787
I'm not here to hurt you.

11:03.916 --> 11:05.375
I told you, I wasn't gonna hurt you.

11:05.492 --> 11:07.692
Please, please, please, please!
I have a lot of money.

11:07.693 --> 11:09.733
- No. No, st-stop.
- I can get you a lot of money.

11:09.734 --> 11:11.094
My name is Navy SEAL Barry Hopper.

11:11.163 --> 11:12.843
I was picked up
off the coast of Pakistan

11:12.844 --> 11:13.806
by the USS Colorado.

11:13.914 --> 11:15.397
I think you know what happened next.

11:15.501 --> 11:16.679
What do you want?

11:18.577 --> 11:20.930
This is the helmet cam video
of our mission in Pakistan

11:21.032 --> 11:22.140
right before we nuked it.

11:22.243 --> 11:24.881
This is what the White House
doesn't want anyone else to see.

11:24.993 --> 11:28.609
It's yours for some of
that money you mentioned.

11:34.228 --> 11:35.428
Captain.

11:35.553 --> 11:36.533
Wait.

11:37.634 --> 11:39.724
This will be the start
of the formal negotiations.

11:39.879 --> 11:42.578
I took the liberty of removing
this from your stateroom, sir.

11:43.874 --> 11:45.615
It's the last one.

11:46.581 --> 11:47.875
Thank you, Lieutenant.

11:47.988 --> 11:49.807
Not easy being the XO, is it?

11:49.969 --> 11:50.759
No.

11:50.872 --> 11:52.792
It takes time to earn
that kind of trust.

11:52.897 --> 11:54.237
Yes, it does.

11:55.004 --> 11:56.195
Sir.

11:59.099 --> 12:01.613
What are you hoping
to get out of this meeting?

12:05.079 --> 12:06.181
Good to see you, COB.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.272
I didn't realize I'd given you
six days off.

12:08.799 --> 12:10.322
I had crew out looking for you.

12:10.482 --> 12:13.066
My apologies, sir.
It couldn't be avoided.

12:13.225 --> 12:15.193
Had a little trouble
with some of the locals.

12:15.299 --> 12:17.262
It took me a couple of days
to sort it out.

12:17.364 --> 12:18.919
I look forward to hearing about it.

12:19.024 --> 12:20.544
Lieutenant, bring the COB up to speed.

12:20.545 --> 12:22.665
No need, sir. I, uh, I know
you got a representative

12:22.737 --> 12:24.234
of the People's Republic up there.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.527
And, uh, if he flies
a flag on that shack,

12:27.645 --> 12:29.897
it becomes Chinese soil.

12:30.590 --> 12:32.112
Where you been all this time, COB?

12:32.245 --> 12:34.436
Uh, forced walkabout.

12:34.836 --> 12:37.160
Clears your mind.
You should try it.

12:47.813 --> 12:49.702
Ah, Captain Chaplin.

12:49.793 --> 12:51.113
Thank you for the accommodations.

12:51.233 --> 12:52.353
They are more than generous.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.752
Uh, we're stretched a little
thin for creature comforts,

12:54.753 --> 12:55.753
but I hope it'll suffice.

13:00.002 --> 13:01.247
Thank you.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.645
Your mayor stopped by earlier as well.

13:04.792 --> 13:07.889
The title is self-awarded.

13:08.147 --> 13:10.923
He's a local thug
with delusions of grandeur.

13:11.049 --> 13:12.429
I recognize the species.

13:12.550 --> 13:15.388
Allow me to present this gift to you.

13:16.376 --> 13:18.553
This was my grandfather's go board.

13:18.666 --> 13:19.800
Do you play?

13:19.915 --> 13:21.471
I'm more of a chess man.

13:21.586 --> 13:24.238
Chess.
In chess, the victor

13:24.361 --> 13:26.749
is the one who annihilates
his opponent's armies.

13:26.864 --> 13:28.252
In <i>Weiqi,</i> or go,

13:28.365 --> 13:29.348
victory goes to the one

13:29.465 --> 13:31.172
who can control the most territory

13:31.275 --> 13:32.568
with the fewest armies.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.214
A better game for our times.
Maybe.

13:35.517 --> 13:37.877
I'm aware of what I stand
to gain by your presence here...

13:37.879 --> 13:38.616
Protection.

13:38.727 --> 13:40.447
Any country that attacks us
attacks China.

13:40.448 --> 13:41.641
It legitimizes us.

13:41.758 --> 13:43.958
You'll no longer be at the mercy
of the United States.

13:44.079 --> 13:45.839
At the mercy of
the current administration.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.359
Don't ever confuse my nation
with its current ruler.

13:48.483 --> 13:50.881
Well, one can only be
a reflection of the other.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.618
In return, China garners
international prestige.

13:53.734 --> 13:55.134
China legitimizes the rogue captain

13:55.203 --> 13:57.782
and by doing so,
attacks US credibility.

13:57.885 --> 14:00.884
I become a puppet
with a nuclear submarine.

14:00.998 --> 14:03.198
China couldn't make you
a puppet even if we wanted to.

14:03.295 --> 14:05.767
You're a powerful symbol
the world over.

14:05.884 --> 14:07.120
A symbol of what?

14:08.981 --> 14:11.382
My wife and I at Hoover dam.

14:11.592 --> 14:12.840
She loves the Grand Canyon,

14:12.982 --> 14:14.474
but for me, this...

14:14.591 --> 14:15.986
This is stunning.

14:16.321 --> 14:18.140
Great and audacious,

14:18.258 --> 14:20.311
humbling in its ambition and heart.

14:20.444 --> 14:21.955
You are that symbol.

14:22.068 --> 14:23.543
After the events of Pakistan

14:23.653 --> 14:25.711
and your actions
against Indian imperialism,

14:25.869 --> 14:28.669
to the many who question where
the heart of America lies,

14:29.070 --> 14:31.855
it's felt.
Perhaps it lies in you.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.146
Sir.

14:35.115 --> 14:37.029
There's a problem at the prison.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.591
It's Hawkes.

14:43.648 --> 14:46.476
Another minute, we'd have been
digging a hole for you.

14:46.603 --> 14:48.403
Is that what you really want?

14:49.085 --> 14:52.023
Son, I know what happened
was a terrible thing.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.718
But I don't want to lose any more lives

14:53.754 --> 14:55.145
than I already have.

14:55.267 --> 14:57.317
What can I do for you?

14:58.375 --> 15:00.093
You can surrender.

15:01.229 --> 15:02.891
That's it.

15:05.686 --> 15:07.796
I sincerely hope you feel better.

15:15.809 --> 15:17.693
Why wasn't he on suicide watch?

15:18.567 --> 15:20.615
We've never considered suicide watch.

15:20.725 --> 15:22.845
We barely have enough people
to guard them as it is.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.034
We're not equipped for this.

15:24.197 --> 15:25.275
Uh, no, sir.

15:25.385 --> 15:27.948
We now have 25 prisoners that we
have to maintain, and frankly,

15:27.949 --> 15:30.389
the active crew is starting to
resent the prison population.

15:30.390 --> 15:32.350
These guys don't have to work
for their rations.

15:32.351 --> 15:34.348
So the way they see it,
they're getting a free ride.

15:34.472 --> 15:35.847
- You getting all this, COB?
- Yes, sir.

15:35.848 --> 15:38.048
I leave for a week, and we
become the USS Leavenworth.

15:38.049 --> 15:39.924
A third of the crew thought
they'd be going home last week,

15:39.953 --> 15:41.844
and when that fell through,
they started acting out.

15:41.845 --> 15:43.565
So, Lieutenant,
you and the COB find a way

15:43.566 --> 15:45.606
to deal with our disciplinary
problem. Understood?

15:45.607 --> 15:46.887
- Yes, sir.
- Brannan, with me.

15:46.888 --> 15:47.954
Need a word, COB.

15:48.144 --> 15:50.194
Hey, COB.
I said I need a word.

15:50.555 --> 15:52.075
Listen, while you've been on vacation,

15:52.076 --> 15:53.156
I've been doing three jobs.

15:53.157 --> 15:55.498
- I need you AJ squared away.
- Oh.

15:55.587 --> 15:56.555
What's wrong?

15:56.674 --> 15:58.577
I can't let him see me like this.

16:15.836 --> 16:17.546
That's a lot of money right there.

16:18.794 --> 16:20.226
That why you came to Manila?

16:20.906 --> 16:23.419
I came to help you,
you ungrateful bastard.

16:24.972 --> 16:27.912
I got 'em all over...
Manila, Jakarta, Kabul.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.592
You know, you take down a kingpin

16:31.702 --> 16:33.606
who's been running drugs
for 30 years...

16:34.763 --> 16:36.087
Before you remand the cash...

16:36.221 --> 16:37.903
Hmm. Take a little
for yourself.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.371
It's not stealing.

16:39.488 --> 16:42.688
It's insurance...
in the unlikely event

16:42.802 --> 16:44.709
you become an inconvenience
to your country.

16:48.574 --> 16:49.894
So you thinking about cutting out

16:49.895 --> 16:51.345
after we find Christine?

16:54.246 --> 16:55.679
Yeah.

16:55.761 --> 16:57.175
Yeah, I am.

16:58.509 --> 17:00.150
I'm not like you and Wes...

17:00.261 --> 17:01.708
You know, family men.

17:03.129 --> 17:05.029
For me, family was, uh,

17:05.446 --> 17:07.118
mom taking the empties
out the back door

17:07.266 --> 17:10.184
and dad turning up the TV
to drown out the sound.

17:11.855 --> 17:15.194
I signed up for the Navy
when I was 17 on a fake ID.

17:15.315 --> 17:17.621
A year later,
I'm in the 46-hour hell week,

17:17.741 --> 17:19.497
mud caked over every inch of my body.

17:19.609 --> 17:20.970
I'd just finished
a 10-mile run,

17:21.098 --> 17:24.585
and now I gotta carry a log
the size of a telephone pole

17:24.704 --> 17:26.089
over soft sand.

17:28.220 --> 17:30.556
And I remember thinking to myself,

17:31.515 --> 17:32.738
man...

17:33.612 --> 17:37.844
this is the best fun
I've ever had in my life.

17:38.311 --> 17:39.762
No, I get it.

17:41.039 --> 17:42.833
I do. I get it.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.515
There's this place

17:46.008 --> 17:47.353
in Bali...

17:47.443 --> 17:49.112
room service 24/7,

17:49.216 --> 17:50.863
jacuzzis on the balcony,

17:50.983 --> 17:54.974
2 infinity pools...
one 30 feet above the other.

17:55.082 --> 17:56.522
You tell me, you get Christine back,

17:56.523 --> 17:58.765
you're not thinking
about ditching, too.

18:04.204 --> 18:05.772
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:07.146 --> 18:08.332
Here you go.

18:09.067 --> 18:10.042
This is the guy?

18:10.147 --> 18:10.701
Oh, trust me,

18:10.702 --> 18:12.902
if it's in Manila and on
the shady side of the street,

18:13.017 --> 18:14.794
he'll know who's walking there.

18:14.898 --> 18:16.964
Thank you, brother.
I owe you one.

18:17.072 --> 18:18.332
Nah.

18:20.386 --> 18:22.186
Hey, listen, you stuck
your neck out for me.

18:22.187 --> 18:23.026
Thank you.

18:23.283 --> 18:24.590
Hey, my advice?

18:25.491 --> 18:27.628
Get her out and don't look back.

18:42.586 --> 18:44.382
You shouldn't have split nines.

18:44.501 --> 18:46.242
Well, what's a few grand
between friends?

18:47.045 --> 18:48.254
I'm still feeling lucky.

18:48.758 --> 18:50.026
Actually...

18:50.404 --> 18:52.102
I'm looking for some foreign action.

18:53.861 --> 18:55.861
I don't think I can help you with that.

18:56.071 --> 18:59.425
American game.
The exclusive kind.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.232
No game like that here.

19:06.633 --> 19:09.365
I'm playing a hunch.
You know what we came here for.

19:09.366 --> 19:10.806
So I'm gonna put money on the table.

19:10.807 --> 19:12.327
I'm gonna put more money on the table.

19:12.426 --> 19:14.266
And I'm gonna keep putting money
on the table

19:14.267 --> 19:15.987
till somebody notices
and starts to wonder

19:15.988 --> 19:17.753
what exactly it is I'm paying you for.

19:17.936 --> 19:19.473
You understand me?

19:22.454 --> 19:25.130
There is an old abandoned
warehouse in Sampaloc,

19:25.280 --> 19:26.839
a few miles from here.

19:26.955 --> 19:28.595
I think you will find
a good game there.

19:28.622 --> 19:29.539
How many players?

19:29.638 --> 19:31.377
Four. All Filipino.

19:31.472 --> 19:33.650
Save one, an American named Franzen.

19:33.847 --> 19:35.254
Be careful with him.

19:35.346 --> 19:36.514
He cheats.

19:36.774 --> 19:38.331
Nice doing business with you.

19:45.581 --> 19:46.825
That guy...

19:46.924 --> 19:48.304
he recognize you?

19:49.333 --> 19:50.460
I don't know. Why?

19:50.562 --> 19:51.939
You know him?

19:52.035 --> 19:53.397
Long time ago.

19:54.112 --> 19:56.410
We got a location.
What do you want to do?

20:22.917 --> 20:24.166
Sam?

20:25.079 --> 20:26.701
Sam.

20:27.950 --> 20:29.860
Put it on. Put it on.
Put it on. Put it on.

20:30.059 --> 20:31.028
Let's go.

20:58.956 --> 21:00.219
Hey.

21:00.721 --> 21:02.512
Hi.

21:05.231 --> 21:06.656
Are you okay?

21:08.087 --> 21:09.423
This is so strange.

21:09.534 --> 21:10.860
It is strange.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.878
I saw you.

21:21.006 --> 21:23.149
I saw you on the ship with Paul.

21:24.281 --> 21:25.490
Sam, nothing happened.

21:25.631 --> 21:27.199
That was all just an act.

21:27.533 --> 21:29.974
It was the only way
that I could get to you.

21:30.809 --> 21:33.614
Things got a bit more
complicated, but...

21:33.737 --> 21:35.618
Sam, I love you.

21:35.742 --> 21:36.951
Only you.

21:37.053 --> 21:39.039
Everything that I did
was to get to you.

21:39.159 --> 21:40.159
You have to believe that.

21:40.264 --> 21:42.424
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I believe you. I believe you.

21:42.949 --> 21:44.160
I believe you.

21:44.260 --> 21:46.441
You don't have to say
anything more. I believe you.

21:48.951 --> 21:51.638
I literally dreamed of
what this moment would be...

21:53.752 --> 21:55.209
but in my dreams,

21:55.336 --> 21:57.891
you're walking through
the front door of our home.

21:58.004 --> 21:58.727
I know.

21:58.878 --> 22:00.758
And we weren't on
the other side of the world,

22:00.759 --> 22:01.719
and it wasn't this hard.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.845
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come here.

22:04.022 --> 22:05.193
It's okay.

22:05.678 --> 22:07.655
It's okay.

22:08.116 --> 22:09.741
I love you.

22:09.844 --> 22:11.402
I love you, too.

22:21.149 --> 22:22.538
You're awake.

22:22.654 --> 22:24.885
As astute as ever, Lieutenant.

22:25.562 --> 22:28.136
You took advantage of me.
I understand.

22:29.412 --> 22:30.900
Well, you can rely on my discretion.

22:31.007 --> 22:32.279
It never happened.

22:32.635 --> 22:33.674
Don't worry.

22:33.797 --> 22:35.266
No one knows you're here but me.

22:35.371 --> 22:37.091
Are you gonna tell
the captain about this?

22:37.092 --> 22:38.747
You gonna tell me what's going on?

22:40.101 --> 22:41.874
A few of the local bad guys...

22:41.982 --> 22:43.408
they jumped me.

22:43.683 --> 22:45.382
Their idea of fun was
to hog-tie me

22:45.490 --> 22:48.147
and throw me in a ditch
on the other side of the island.

22:49.953 --> 22:51.513
It took two days without food and water

22:51.622 --> 22:53.436
to wiggle out.

22:53.805 --> 22:55.151
I'm not proud.

22:55.247 --> 22:57.167
But if you feel the need
to burden the captain,

22:57.197 --> 22:59.797
that's...
that's your prerogative.

23:02.739 --> 23:05.047
Report tomorrow, 0500.

23:12.250 --> 23:12.958
Oh, God.

23:13.060 --> 23:15.648
Perhaps your America
is not America anymore.

23:15.802 --> 23:17.441
But a reckoning may come,

23:17.914 --> 23:20.314
and you will find the measures

23:20.432 --> 23:22.556
and the compromises you make

23:22.724 --> 23:25.237
may no longer be temporary.

23:26.112 --> 23:27.620
I believe...

23:28.117 --> 23:29.420
in my heart,

23:29.634 --> 23:32.601
that one day I will drive
that sub into Kings Bay.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.418
I'll walk into the Pentagon
and declare,

23:34.527 --> 23:36.935
"I am captain Marcus Chaplin
of the USS Colorado,

23:37.063 --> 23:38.817
and I'm here
to clear my name."

23:39.728 --> 23:41.793
I believe this is temporary.

23:41.907 --> 23:43.116
And if it isn't...

23:43.222 --> 23:45.025
You would go mad.

23:48.644 --> 23:51.349
It's a tricky game.
You caught me.

23:51.595 --> 23:53.352
Here is my offer.

23:53.463 --> 23:55.857
I'll give you food, supplies,

23:55.973 --> 23:57.252
anything you need.

23:57.361 --> 23:58.476
And in return?

23:58.580 --> 24:00.179
Your jail is filled.

24:00.278 --> 24:03.354
Your men are starved,
cut off, attacked.

24:03.563 --> 24:05.354
You will agree

24:05.673 --> 24:09.390
because we offer the only
solution to your problem.

24:09.496 --> 24:11.942
And as an ally, we are very powerful.

24:12.079 --> 24:13.871
Nothing in return.

24:13.989 --> 24:17.307
Everything is in the acceptance.

24:18.700 --> 24:21.873
I cannot accept.

24:23.651 --> 24:26.288
I wonder, Marcus,

24:26.394 --> 24:28.219
what will become of you.

24:38.372 --> 24:40.257
I met this kid today.

24:40.687 --> 24:42.226
Charlie.

24:43.845 --> 24:45.866
What was Charlie like?

24:47.261 --> 24:48.735
He was really smart,

24:48.841 --> 24:52.052
really polite, but tough, you know?

24:52.164 --> 24:53.604
I mean, if you gave him a hard time,

24:53.605 --> 24:54.685
he would be more than happy

24:54.686 --> 24:56.278
to give it right back to you, you know?

24:57.868 --> 24:59.882
Sam Kendal, age 9.

24:59.995 --> 25:01.657
Yeah, I guess so.

25:03.005 --> 25:05.076
I hadn't thought about that, but, yeah.

25:08.873 --> 25:10.963
- Mm.
- If we had a kid,

25:11.082 --> 25:13.440
it would probably be
a lot like that, wouldn't he?

25:17.544 --> 25:19.728
Hey. Look at me.

25:20.016 --> 25:21.877
What if we disappeared...

25:22.745 --> 25:24.217
right now?

25:24.652 --> 25:26.292
Just dropped off
the face off the earth,

25:26.293 --> 25:27.744
just the two of us.

25:28.287 --> 25:29.809
Maybe the three of us.

25:29.923 --> 25:31.587
How is that possible?

25:31.700 --> 25:32.911
I don't know.

25:35.048 --> 25:37.208
But we would figure it out together.

25:37.932 --> 25:39.222
You could do anything.

25:39.334 --> 25:40.854
You could paint all day if you wanted.

25:40.855 --> 25:42.709
I could build ships for millionaires.

25:43.564 --> 25:45.212
We would figure it out.

25:46.293 --> 25:48.173
Look, I have been trying
to do the right thing

25:48.174 --> 25:49.734
for so long now.

25:49.841 --> 25:51.809
Tried to be the best sailor.

25:51.996 --> 25:54.140
Tried to be the best XO.

25:54.301 --> 25:55.469
But I'm just...

25:56.713 --> 25:58.251
I'm tired.

25:58.964 --> 26:00.250
I'm tired.

26:01.339 --> 26:02.933
Let's do it.

26:17.913 --> 26:19.606
I propose a truce.

26:21.766 --> 26:24.788
I could supply everything you need.

26:24.912 --> 26:27.112
I know plenty of pirates
willing to risk the blockade.

26:27.113 --> 26:27.856
They already have.

26:27.997 --> 26:30.715
If you and I were on
the same side, Captain,

26:31.083 --> 26:33.572
just think of what we could accomplish.

26:35.874 --> 26:37.747
I grew up with men like you.

26:37.861 --> 26:39.253
Call themselves "the mayor,"

26:39.349 --> 26:41.600
act like a friend to the people,

26:41.710 --> 26:43.552
say they'll protect you.

26:46.834 --> 26:48.891
So I disgust you?

26:48.999 --> 26:50.799
You know, I grew up
with men like that, too.

26:50.872 --> 26:52.105
So why are we different?

26:52.220 --> 26:55.075
Because you became a sea captain?

26:55.240 --> 26:56.606
You think you are noble.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.629
You are just a uniform.

26:58.739 --> 27:01.205
Take that away, and you
will see what you truly are.

27:01.323 --> 27:02.738
You want to see...

27:03.130 --> 27:04.767
what I truly am?

27:11.334 --> 27:12.943
My offer is still good, Captain.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.077
Good night.

27:27.469 --> 27:28.602
Enter.

27:29.633 --> 27:31.071
You needed me, sir?

27:33.647 --> 27:37.394
Mr. Serrat says that he
will bring in all manner of pirates

27:37.559 --> 27:39.737
and our cup runneth over.

27:39.862 --> 27:42.583
Mr. Zheng of China
wants to give us aid

27:42.809 --> 27:45.738
and is willing to risk
a confrontation to do so.

27:45.855 --> 27:47.820
This is where the, uh,
XO usually jumps in

27:47.981 --> 27:51.505
to provide another perspective,
provoke debate.

27:52.114 --> 27:53.613
Um, sorry, sir.

27:53.731 --> 27:54.668
Sorry I'm not him.

27:54.771 --> 27:56.670
I've had too much to drink, Lieutenant.

27:56.777 --> 27:58.579
You can stop with the bug eyes.

27:58.707 --> 27:59.612
So...

27:59.730 --> 28:01.783
you've been dying to say your piece.

28:02.245 --> 28:03.413
Say it.

28:04.623 --> 28:06.768
There are always strings attached

28:06.878 --> 28:08.296
to any offer.

28:08.594 --> 28:09.782
An alliance, sir?

28:09.783 --> 28:11.223
What kind of message does that send?

28:11.224 --> 28:12.584
How does that help to get us home?

28:12.585 --> 28:14.945
And... and how does it help
to clear our names when we do?

28:15.051 --> 28:16.211
We're not a sovereign nation,

28:16.212 --> 28:17.692
therefore it wouldn't be an alliance.

28:17.693 --> 28:19.162
Stop lying to yourself.

28:19.349 --> 28:21.820
This administration will starve us out.

28:22.390 --> 28:23.710
They'll bleed us dry.

28:23.819 --> 28:25.699
They will watch men and women
die of infection

28:25.787 --> 28:27.433
before they move in.

28:28.439 --> 28:31.160
Is this worth starting
World War III over?

28:31.268 --> 28:33.250
World War III has already started.

28:33.371 --> 28:36.069
The bombs that hit Pakistan
did more then destroy a nation.

28:36.170 --> 28:38.280
Restraint is failing.

28:38.376 --> 28:39.656
And the question is, Lieutenant,

28:39.657 --> 28:41.657
do we skitter around the edges,
gathering crumbs,

28:41.774 --> 28:43.406
or do we plant our flag?

28:43.511 --> 28:45.216
I'd like to hear your position.

28:45.316 --> 28:46.778
I said what I believe.

28:46.883 --> 28:48.557
It would be a mistake.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.404
Thank you, Lieutenant.

29:10.872 --> 29:12.143
Everything set?

29:12.548 --> 29:14.470
Wes will give us a ride
out of town tomorrow.

29:14.635 --> 29:15.470
Good.

29:15.619 --> 29:17.286
I'm headed to Central America.

29:17.392 --> 29:18.879
I'm thinking Costa Rica.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.296
You make up your mind?

29:20.738 --> 29:22.702
I don't know.
I heard Bali's nice.

29:27.357 --> 29:28.511
Hey.

29:28.647 --> 29:29.757
What is it?

29:29.862 --> 29:32.687
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? What's wrong?

29:33.251 --> 29:35.235
That guy from the casino?

29:35.611 --> 29:36.968
I met him in BUD/S.

29:37.085 --> 29:38.948
He's a strange guy,
even by SEAL standards.

29:39.062 --> 29:39.813
Okay.

29:39.938 --> 29:41.138
He gets bounced from the Navy,

29:41.139 --> 29:42.579
he goes into business for himself...

29:42.727 --> 29:44.290
mercenary work.

29:44.424 --> 29:46.190
That's what he's doing here in Manila.

29:47.514 --> 29:48.864
Kendal...

29:49.155 --> 29:51.366
US have put a bounty on your head.

29:54.106 --> 29:56.124
- How much?
- $5 million.

29:57.221 --> 29:58.581
And that's the big-time,
brother.

29:58.582 --> 30:00.716
I never got more than
a couple hundred grand myself.

30:04.334 --> 30:05.257
Sam...

30:05.394 --> 30:06.632
I know this guy.

30:06.893 --> 30:08.207
He's vicious.

30:08.512 --> 30:10.601
He fights dirty and he does not stop.

30:10.703 --> 30:12.583
And it would be one thing
if it were just him,

30:12.584 --> 30:14.664
but there are gonna be
a hundred more guys like him

30:14.665 --> 30:16.388
trying to track you down
wherever you go.

30:21.112 --> 30:22.319
Okay.

30:36.389 --> 30:37.869
- Put 'em in the brig.
- Yes, ma'am.

30:41.278 --> 30:43.658
Hey! Stop. Stop!

30:48.632 --> 30:51.408
See that these men get
medical attention immediately.

30:51.527 --> 30:52.970
- Where's the COB?
- I...

30:53.072 --> 30:55.403
Where is the COB?!

30:56.111 --> 30:57.591
Last I saw him, he was at the prison.

30:57.706 --> 30:59.026
Sir, it seems like some of the...

30:59.027 --> 30:59.831
Enough. Enough.

30:59.832 --> 31:01.312
Lieutenant Shepard, go to the prison.

31:01.313 --> 31:03.233
Have all the prisoners
draw straws. Two shorts.

31:03.341 --> 31:05.301
Bring all the prisoners
and have the entire crew

31:05.302 --> 31:07.292
fall in at 1600.
Understood?

31:07.702 --> 31:08.790
Yes, sir.

31:13.949 --> 31:14.867
Okay.

31:14.962 --> 31:16.623
You're gonna have to stop doing that.

31:17.732 --> 31:19.841
That hasn't been
anywhere unsanitary, has it?

31:22.501 --> 31:23.044
$6 million,

31:23.045 --> 31:24.725
transferred to an account
in the Caymans.

31:24.835 --> 31:25.749
Half tomorrow,

31:25.844 --> 31:27.257
the other half in three days.

31:27.363 --> 31:29.312
Is money really the only thing
you care about?

31:29.421 --> 31:30.911
What about your SEAL team?

31:31.018 --> 31:32.739
What about the crew
of the USS Colorado?

31:32.849 --> 31:34.729
Half's for me.
The other half's for James King

31:34.806 --> 31:36.114
so we can both be ghosts.

31:36.233 --> 31:38.751
And you're an odd one to cast stones.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.002
Half tomorrow and you can see the rest.

31:41.118 --> 31:42.878
And if you think
it's worth the other half,

31:42.879 --> 31:43.479
it's all yours.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.643
Fine. You'll get it.

31:46.378 --> 31:47.998
- Just leave me...
- Time to go.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.230
Kylie?

31:49.275 --> 31:51.755
Kylie, look, I know you have
no reason to trust me right now,

31:51.756 --> 31:53.236
but you have to listen to me, please.

31:53.237 --> 31:53.837
Who's this guy?

31:53.976 --> 31:55.296
Someone I would like you to kill.

31:55.297 --> 31:55.778
Seriously?

31:55.882 --> 31:58.299
No. Look, you just passed
two traffic CCTV cameras,

31:58.300 --> 31:59.700
and there's an ATM across the road.

31:59.701 --> 32:01.261
In about five minutes, there's gonna...

32:01.262 --> 32:02.262
Would you just shoot him?

32:02.263 --> 32:03.303
Would you stop saying that

32:03.304 --> 32:04.984
to someone who's actually
carrying a gun?

32:05.129 --> 32:07.249
Petty Officer Hopper,
I am trying to save your life,

32:07.250 --> 32:07.730
both of you.

32:07.818 --> 32:09.178
There are people, powerful people,

32:09.210 --> 32:10.995
who are gathering right now,
organizing...

32:11.427 --> 32:12.503
a coup d'etat.

32:12.616 --> 32:14.736
No, those happen in
third-world countries, not here.

32:14.812 --> 32:15.797
It's gonna happen here,

32:15.907 --> 32:18.005
and you two could be the tipping point.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.354
Please let me show you.
Please.

32:20.489 --> 32:22.343
Or this could end
for all of us right now.

32:40.424 --> 32:41.415
You must be Wes.

32:41.542 --> 32:42.982
- Yeah.
- Thank you for everything.

32:43.107 --> 32:45.147
Oh, I didn't do anything
anybody else wouldn't do.

32:45.148 --> 32:45.828
I don't think so.

32:45.829 --> 32:46.820
We should get going.

32:47.011 --> 32:47.703
Yeah.

32:47.814 --> 32:48.858
Come here.

32:58.121 --> 32:59.754
- Look...
- No.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.804
It was just a crazy dream.

33:07.260 --> 33:09.570
I managed to get ahold
of your friend Kylie.

33:09.964 --> 33:11.524
There's a private plane waiting for you

33:11.570 --> 33:13.305
at the airport in Silay.

33:13.437 --> 33:15.017
Wes is gonna take you to the airport.

33:15.166 --> 33:18.260
Wait a minute. I thought
you were both going.

33:18.411 --> 33:19.502
Change of plans.

33:19.503 --> 33:21.023
You're gonna drive her to the airport.

33:21.106 --> 33:22.506
And Sam's going back to the island.

33:22.614 --> 33:24.014
If you're with me, you're not safe.

33:24.015 --> 33:25.535
- I don't care.
- Yeah, I know. I do.

33:25.586 --> 33:27.106
The plane's gonna take you to Geneva.

33:27.107 --> 33:27.827
Here's the address

33:27.828 --> 33:29.508
of an apartment
we've arranged for you...

33:29.615 --> 33:31.015
Look, I'm not going to Geneva, Sam.

33:31.016 --> 33:33.056
You can't go back to the States,
can you? Can you?

33:33.057 --> 33:35.863
12 hours and 27 minutes...
that is how long it took

33:35.979 --> 33:37.773
between the Navy
knocking on our front door

33:37.774 --> 33:40.254
and the phone ringing and your
voice being on the other line.

33:40.379 --> 33:42.267
Okay? 12 hours

33:42.364 --> 33:44.431
of me not knowing
if you were dead or alive,

33:44.536 --> 33:46.708
and all that I could do
was wait... sit and wait.

33:46.830 --> 33:48.098
I can't sit like that, Sam.

33:48.211 --> 33:49.851
Okay, I know.
I don't want that for you.

33:50.054 --> 33:51.083
I don't.

33:51.188 --> 33:52.561
I want you to have a life.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.850
A real life with
a husband and kids... a life.

33:54.971 --> 33:56.411
- Sam, I have one.
- No, you don't.

33:56.412 --> 33:57.938
I have one.

33:59.014 --> 34:01.426
And I can wait for the rest, okay?

34:03.138 --> 34:05.246
We'll have that when we can be together

34:05.670 --> 34:07.310
without having to look
over shoulders...

34:07.412 --> 34:08.376
really,

34:08.493 --> 34:10.248
really together.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.274
Come here. I love you.

34:14.516 --> 34:16.090
Okay? I love you.

34:16.297 --> 34:17.759
You be safe.

34:19.752 --> 34:21.672
Okay, look, I don't know
where anybody's going,

34:21.672 --> 34:22.695
but it has gotta be now.

34:24.170 --> 34:26.386
- Come on, Christine.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

34:26.891 --> 34:27.917
Go, go, go, go!

34:28.230 --> 34:29.172
Sam!

34:52.255 --> 34:54.078
Hey, cover me! Cover me!

35:06.418 --> 35:08.768
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go!

35:34.337 --> 35:36.171
Sam. You hear that?

35:36.284 --> 35:37.532
Those cops are not our friends.

35:37.650 --> 35:39.115
We stay here, we die.

35:39.247 --> 35:41.298
Sam. Sam, she's gone.

35:42.913 --> 35:44.157
We gotta go.

35:44.269 --> 35:45.744
Do you understand?
Come on!

35:53.134 --> 35:55.707
From theft to assault to desertion,

35:55.708 --> 35:56.988
all of you have committed crimes

35:56.989 --> 35:59.029
which have put your fellow
crew members in danger.

35:59.047 --> 36:01.955
We no longer have the resources
to feed you, to house you,

36:02.097 --> 36:03.121
to guard you.

36:03.231 --> 36:05.047
In short, this ain't working.

36:05.152 --> 36:08.102
Prison is a luxury
we can no longer afford.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.529
And let me assure you, gentlemen,

36:09.530 --> 36:11.250
just as there are no atheists
in foxholes,

36:11.296 --> 36:13.499
there are no prisons
on the battlefield.

36:13.609 --> 36:14.889
And as beautiful as it may seem,

36:14.890 --> 36:16.434
that's where we find ourselves today,

36:16.557 --> 36:18.187
on the battlefield,

36:18.289 --> 36:20.054
fighting for our lives, our honor,

36:20.163 --> 36:22.574
and <i>I</i> believe our nation.

36:23.893 --> 36:25.257
Lieutenant,

36:25.754 --> 36:27.328
the prisoners drew straws?

36:27.859 --> 36:28.998
Yes, sir.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.029
Whoever drew the short straws
will be lashed.

36:34.145 --> 36:37.183
The rest of you, to a man,
will return to your duty.

36:37.376 --> 36:40.136
There are no criminals
on Sainte Marina,

36:40.252 --> 36:42.637
only crimes and their punishment.

36:42.741 --> 36:45.538
As of today, there is no brig
of the USS Colorado.

36:45.707 --> 36:46.822
Am I understood?

36:46.921 --> 36:48.631
Sir, yes, sir.

36:48.876 --> 36:50.518
I regret that it's come to this.

36:50.659 --> 36:52.650
Who drew the short straws?

36:55.828 --> 36:59.123
Who drew the second short straw?

36:59.874 --> 37:01.253
Sir.

37:01.464 --> 37:03.104
I was never punished
for putting the sub

37:03.173 --> 37:04.924
and the crew in danger.

37:06.048 --> 37:08.565
I would like to volunteer.

37:10.928 --> 37:12.372
Master-at-arms,

37:12.976 --> 37:13.936
dispense the punishment.

37:14.041 --> 37:15.284
No.

37:15.673 --> 37:17.199
I'll do it, sir.

37:19.882 --> 37:21.396
I'm the only one that should do this,

37:21.512 --> 37:22.799
and you know it.

37:22.999 --> 37:24.461
Do it right, Joe.

37:24.577 --> 37:25.852
Yes, sir.

37:26.582 --> 37:27.870
Step up, sailor.

37:30.614 --> 37:32.070
Master-at-arms.

38:29.868 --> 38:32.670
Our two nations are
beacons of the first world,

38:32.839 --> 38:34.857
yet millions languish in our prisons.

38:35.065 --> 38:36.905
Your choice today...

38:37.343 --> 38:39.476
was perhaps the more humane one.

38:40.098 --> 38:42.055
If I take your assistance...

38:42.677 --> 38:45.237
you'll be poking
the United States in the eye,

38:45.357 --> 38:47.624
and their response will be aggressive.

38:49.169 --> 38:50.968
If you do not take our assistance,

38:51.077 --> 38:53.517
who knows what greater lengths
you will have to go to?

38:53.629 --> 38:55.325
Today it was lashings.

38:55.482 --> 38:57.891
What measures might tomorrow bring?

38:57.999 --> 38:59.760
Does China really care
about any of that?

38:59.864 --> 39:01.151
No.

39:01.255 --> 39:02.811
China does not.

39:03.476 --> 39:06.831
You will not be allowed
aboard the Colorado, ever.

39:08.335 --> 39:11.091
You will have your supplies
in 48 hours.

39:11.412 --> 39:12.979
And I'd like to remain here,

39:13.346 --> 39:14.929
with your permission.

39:16.061 --> 39:17.356
You have it.

39:47.547 --> 39:49.643
You gotta be kidding me.

40:15.782 --> 40:16.782
Yeah.

40:16.883 --> 40:18.251
Thanks.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.403
You're gonna have to eat, Christine.

40:47.516 --> 40:49.178
You may be here a while.

40:49.479 --> 40:51.939
Look, I'm not a bad guy.
Okay? I didn't plan this.

40:52.048 --> 40:54.328
I'm just doing what I have to
to take care of my family.

40:54.412 --> 40:56.070
You understand?

40:56.617 --> 40:57.570
Come on.

40:58.819 --> 41:00.260
Come on.
