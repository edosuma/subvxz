00:49.680 --> 00:52.000
Today, after seven years in office,

00:52.080 --> 00:54.600
the mayor of Rome
has tendered his resignation.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.280
It will become effective in 20 days.

00:57.360 --> 01:00.520
In his farewell speech,
at his final council meeting,

01:00.600 --> 01:04.879
he stated that his decision had been
difficult and not taken lightly.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.280
The outgoing mayor pointed out

01:11.360 --> 01:14.400
that respect for the electorate
and the citizens of Rome

01:14.480 --> 01:16.640
had always been his top priority.

01:16.720 --> 01:19.760
A scenario of strong indecision lies ahead

01:19.840 --> 01:21.720
among all political parties

01:21.800 --> 01:25.680
for the choice of a candidate
to present at the upcoming elections.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.600
What's happening?

03:43.720 --> 03:47.760
THE PREVIOUS DAY

03:49.240 --> 03:54.080
OSTIA LIDO, NEAR ROME

03:54.800 --> 03:57.080
For fuck's sake,
have you got eyes or not?

03:57.720 --> 03:59.920
Can't you see
what kind of places people want?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.440
If you throw some cash at the kiosk,
it'll fill up!

04:02.520 --> 04:05.240
Clients that, besides eating and drinking,
wanna score coke.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.120
Listen to this, your brother wants
to tell me how to make money!

04:10.200 --> 04:11.280
It isn't yours. It belonged to Mom.

04:12.480 --> 04:16.120
-What?
-Leave your mother out of this.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.200
Dad.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.560
See if you can talk sense
into this dickhead.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.880
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

04:25.040 --> 04:27.320
Why do you insist? You know it bugs him.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.720
Leave it.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.240
There's a gypsy outside our club.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.280
-Gypsy, I got something to tell you.
-Tell me.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.640
You can't stay here, piece of shit.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.160
Piece of shit!

05:13.280 --> 05:17.120
Shut that fucking dog up!
Throw that douchebag out.

05:18.640 --> 05:22.600
ROME CENTER

05:31.120 --> 05:35.240
I don't believe it!

06:02.760 --> 06:05.800
-Gabriele Marchilli?
-Yeah, what do you need?

06:05.880 --> 06:07.000
Come outside!

06:25.400 --> 06:26.800
You know who I am, right?

06:28.360 --> 06:31.680
Good, we can get straight to the point.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.400
Let's take a little walk.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.560
You're a good kid, smart, nice enough,

06:39.640 --> 06:42.040
but you did something
you shouldn't have done.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.720
Push pills in Samurai's gym...

06:46.920 --> 06:48.320
Whaddya thinkin'?

06:49.440 --> 06:51.000
Damn you.

06:55.120 --> 06:58.040
You know what he's like.
He didn't take it well.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.720
Actually, he's really pissed.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.600
He wanted damages, plus interest.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.200
But seeing that he's generous,

07:07.120 --> 07:08.920
he only wants 20,000 euros.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.880
20,000 euros?

07:11.960 --> 07:15.000
I only sold 500 euros worth of pills,
are you insane?

07:18.120 --> 07:19.560
How fuckin' dare you?

07:19.640 --> 07:21.960
When I speak, you shut up.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.480
You've got 24 hours to bring me
the money, got it?

07:26.800 --> 07:28.080
Got it?

07:28.760 --> 07:30.680
Now go have fun, go on!

07:34.600 --> 07:35.600
Let's go, Claudio.

07:39.440 --> 07:45.520
ROME OUTSKIRTS

08:00.280 --> 08:02.280
[in Sinti] [Now you are the groom,]

08:03.080 --> 08:06.560
[honor the name you bear
and our traditions.]

08:08.160 --> 08:09.280
[Go on!]

08:10.360 --> 08:11.520
[Go on, Spadino!]

08:12.880 --> 08:13.760
[Go on!]

08:15.920 --> 08:17.120
[Go on, Spadino!]

08:20.640 --> 08:22.320
[Kill this animal, Spadino!]

08:25.080 --> 08:27.040
[Get outta the way.]

08:29.160 --> 08:30.080
[Kill it!]

08:32.520 --> 08:33.520
[Kill it, Spadino.]

08:34.320 --> 08:35.480
[Kill it!]

08:37.080 --> 08:38.559
[Be a man!]

08:40.159 --> 08:41.240
[Kill it!]

08:51.200 --> 08:53.200
[It had to take so long?]

08:53.280 --> 08:55.360
I didn't wanna get dirty.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.480
[Now you can meet your bride.]

09:09.040 --> 09:10.480
[Let's go!]

09:14.600 --> 09:15.800
The mayor's resigning,

09:15.880 --> 09:18.320
I'm on my way
to the council meeting now.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.440
So?

09:19.520 --> 09:21.520
The new zoning plan has been approved,

09:21.600 --> 09:24.800
but to find out who'll get rich on it
and how, we have 20 days.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.720
The time for the resignation
to come into effect. Get with it!

09:27.800 --> 09:31.200
-I pay you to solve problems.
-I am a technocrat.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.880
I can say that your project
for Ostia respects the law,

09:33.960 --> 09:35.760
but they have to put it on the agenda.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.880
They've got to give it priority.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.600
You need... a politician.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.680
-Who?
-Cinaglia.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.040
The chairman of the building commission.

09:49.120 --> 09:52.680
A representative of the people,
a frustrated guy with ideals.

09:58.360 --> 10:01.040
-What is it?
-There's a problem with the gypsies.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.480
That's enough. You've tired him out.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.280
We are outside City Hall,

10:09.360 --> 10:14.280
where the emergency meeting
is about to end

10:14.360 --> 10:17.760
-and the mayor submitted his resignation.
-Sara.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.880
I see.

10:21.960 --> 10:25.120
The commission is split.
The other company has the majority.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.760
-Sara!
-I'm coming.

10:27.560 --> 10:31.360
Monsignor Theodosiou's vote is decisive.
I've been after it for months.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.680
All right, today I'll nail him.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.280
I'll call you later.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.800
Meanwhile, once he resigns,

10:38.880 --> 10:42.560
we must wait the 20 days mandated by law

10:42.640 --> 10:45.120
for the resignation to come into effect.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.960
The mayor's choice
appears to be irrevocable...

10:48.760 --> 10:49.920
What do we do?

10:51.560 --> 10:54.920
They've got 20 days
to decide who builds and where.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.480
We haven't got time, Sara.
You know that.

11:01.040 --> 11:04.480
We're drowning in debt.
I don't want to end up bankrupt.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.880
Neither do they.

11:06.640 --> 11:10.000
Between accounts in the red
and the archbishops on trial in America,

11:10.080 --> 11:12.840
they need money. They have to sell.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.600
Who's coming to the Pope today?

11:15.680 --> 11:16.920
The Swedish Royals.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.880
It will be long then.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.320
Let me know how the meeting goes.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.600
I've got to run.

11:26.840 --> 11:27.960
Don't worry.

11:35.080 --> 11:35.960
Cinaglia!

11:37.120 --> 11:40.480
I heard your party wants
to send a message of change,

11:40.560 --> 11:42.160
new faces in City Hall.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.080
You've been a councilman
for many years, right?

11:45.160 --> 11:48.480
-I've always won lots of votes.
-I know you have.

11:49.240 --> 11:54.040
But this time you risk not making it
onto your party's ticket.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.920
You risk staying home.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.880
Luckily, this is something that doesn't
concern you, right?

11:58.960 --> 12:02.960
Listen to me, you don't throw away
all the years spent in here like this.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.400
You should have a more important office
than the one you hold,

12:06.480 --> 12:08.160
make real public policy.

12:09.080 --> 12:12.160
Speak to the mayor about it
or to somebody who really counts,

12:12.240 --> 12:13.400
like your ex-wife.

12:16.920 --> 12:17.800
Goodbye.

12:26.480 --> 12:32.400
Gentlemen, councilors, quiet, please!

12:32.480 --> 12:35.000
The mayor is making his entrance!

12:52.680 --> 12:53.840
[Hi, Spadino.]

12:53.920 --> 12:55.240
Hi, everything okay?

12:56.280 --> 12:59.040
I heard she's hot.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.480
Are you done, Spadino?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.840
-What do you want?
-Go with him.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.200
-Where?
-Go with him.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.560
-What's up?
-Come outside.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.400
A surprise visit.

13:42.720 --> 13:46.560
Come in, today we're celebrating.
My brother's getting engaged.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.480
I'm fine here. I didn't come to celebrate.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.120
You sent some dipshit

13:52.200 --> 13:54.240
to one of the Adamis' clubs last night?

13:55.600 --> 13:59.360
-You want to expand?
-But that's not your territory.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.280
All of Rome is my territory.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.400
Boris was there for fun,

14:06.480 --> 14:08.920
it's these fuckin' Adamis
that got a short fuse.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.200
Ask them what happened.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.720
Maybe you don't understand me,

14:13.800 --> 14:17.120
but I don't speak Sinti,
and I don't want to learn it.

14:18.080 --> 14:22.120
This is the first and the last time
I'll come to this shithole to tell you.

14:22.200 --> 14:25.440
Be careful not to start a war, you'll lose

14:26.120 --> 14:27.280
and you know it.

14:27.720 --> 14:31.880
But my cousin's still been offended
and that's gotta be dealt with.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.720
I see you're quick on the uptake.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.840
How much they gotta pay you
to forget what happened?

14:43.360 --> 14:46.080
VATICAN CITY, ROME

14:48.560 --> 14:51.200
Our budgetary situation is critical.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.640
But our calling is to provide hope.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.520
The offer I spoke to you about
for our land in Ostia

14:58.600 --> 15:01.320
that we received
from the Blue Mirror consortium

15:01.400 --> 15:04.280
is important precisely because

15:04.360 --> 15:07.040
it could give a basis for hope

15:07.120 --> 15:10.880
and help restore our bottom line.

15:10.960 --> 15:15.320
Cosimo, that's true, but we need to know
who we are selling to.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.520
I want the sale to be crystal clear.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.920
You are our auditor.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.080
Please explain, Mrs. Monaschi,

15:25.720 --> 15:28.600
that at times it is difficult
to turn down certain offers.

15:28.680 --> 15:32.600
Your Eminence, without a doubt,
our bottom line is compromised,

15:32.680 --> 15:34.960
but I share
Monsignor Theodosiou's concerns.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.600
Listen...

15:37.640 --> 15:41.520
I'd like each of us to think carefully
what is best for the Church.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.600
And to think carefully,
we need to pause and reflect.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.920
The meeting is adjourned, brothers.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.200
Monsignor, excuse me,

16:02.720 --> 16:06.400
I think it'd be best
if the pause weren't too long.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.200
-The mayor has just resigned...
-I know.

16:10.920 --> 16:15.120
We need to carefully evaluate
the company we sell to.

16:16.720 --> 16:20.680
Both Blue Mirror and Edilcigno
that your husband is involved with.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.280
Of course.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.440
Perhaps...

16:27.040 --> 16:32.520
One of those carefree evenings might help
you to speed up the considerations.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.840
Shall we say, this evening?

16:45.920 --> 16:47.080
This evening?

16:48.240 --> 16:49.440
Why not?

16:51.120 --> 16:52.520
You'll let me know?

16:54.200 --> 16:55.560
I'll take care of it.

17:18.319 --> 17:19.839
-Did you put sugar in it?
-Yes.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.920
See your father?

17:25.280 --> 17:28.560
-He's Samurai's slave.
-At least the slave of someone powerful.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.720
What the fuck have you done?

17:32.120 --> 17:34.680
-Nothing.
-Did you beat up an Anacleti?

17:34.760 --> 17:37.040
Does Samurai tell you your son's business?

17:37.120 --> 17:39.560
No, he says you're a dumb fuck.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.840
-He was at our club, Dad.
-Now he knows he can't do that.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.760
Now go and say you're sorry

17:45.840 --> 17:49.960
and take him the money
you make from the northern zone.

17:50.040 --> 17:53.040
Shut up, Samurai speaks
and you move your mouth.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.800
-You little shit!
-Go in there.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.440
Calm down.

18:00.960 --> 18:04.280
What a beauty, 12 cylinders.

18:05.040 --> 18:08.160
Your brother's crazy. He's lost his mind.

18:08.760 --> 18:12.520
With you marrying a Sale,
he's convinced he can expand.

18:12.600 --> 18:16.320
He sent me to the Adamis' club
to see their reaction.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.120
Look.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.920
Are you happy?

18:22.320 --> 18:24.960
You need to pick a car
with a certain style.

18:25.560 --> 18:28.920
After all, Angelica's going to be yours
for the rest of your life.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.120
You show up with one of these,

18:33.840 --> 18:35.800
she'll fall at your feet.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.840
Lele?

18:41.800 --> 18:43.760
You spend hours in that bathroom.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.320
-Dad, have you had breakfast?
-What happened to your lip?

18:47.400 --> 18:49.720
No, nothing. I've got to go. It's late.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.280
What's with you this morning?
You seem edgy.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.880
Has something happened?

18:56.960 --> 18:58.080
No, nothing.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.480
Problems at university?

18:59.560 --> 19:00.680
No, don't worry.

19:00.760 --> 19:01.960
Not long now.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.480
You'll be at Gianni's dinner?

19:06.360 --> 19:07.600
Yeah.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.120
Sorry, I'm gonna be late.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.360
Bye!

19:13.440 --> 19:14.440
Bye.

19:21.040 --> 19:24.960
ROME POLICE DEPARTMENT

19:26.960 --> 19:28.800
You've got to help me, Marco.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.280
I pissed off the wrong guy.
Now I owe him 20,000 euros.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.920
Today, I'm begging you!

19:37.720 --> 19:38.840
Marco?

19:40.400 --> 19:41.760
Fuck!

19:42.840 --> 19:43.920
Fuck it!

20:05.520 --> 20:08.000
Sara! How are you?

20:13.400 --> 20:15.160
Today, I'm slammed,

20:15.840 --> 20:17.440
but I should be able to make it.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.560
Where do we meet?

20:23.920 --> 20:26.080
Okay then.

20:26.840 --> 20:27.920
Bye.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.760
Councilman Cinaglia?

20:51.800 --> 20:53.600
A minute of your time.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.800
Aren't you curious to hear
what I've got to say?

21:01.480 --> 21:04.840
No, I don't want to hear anything
from you. Goodbye.

22:10.320 --> 22:13.080
A politician who takes the bus.

22:15.680 --> 22:19.080
Usually they get on them during
election campaigns, chasing votes.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.840
I take it every day.

22:24.840 --> 22:28.840
-Because you represent "the people".
-Precisely.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.720
-But I don't represent people like you.
-Is that so?

22:32.440 --> 22:35.600
-Maybe I voted for you.
-I doubt it.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.760
Rome needs politicians like you.

22:39.840 --> 22:44.040
Politicians who mix with the people,
who love this city.

22:52.640 --> 22:56.320
Men like that should be valued,
as they're increasingly rare.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.600
And you know how to value them.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.960
But what's the cost?

23:05.720 --> 23:07.680
You and I, we want the same thing:

23:09.560 --> 23:10.840
what's good for Rome.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.160
How are you?

23:56.280 --> 23:57.640
I missed you.

24:00.640 --> 24:04.040
Lele, I called you
because I need your help.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.760
I need to throw a party tonight.
You've got to help me.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.280
-You called me to organize a party?
-It's important.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.880
For a very special guest who means a lot.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.600
-I'll try.
-Trying is not enough.

24:18.680 --> 24:22.680
-You haven't called me for three months...
-Gabriele, please...

24:23.880 --> 24:25.320
-All right.
-Please.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.160
You'll have the best blow
and the best hookers,

24:28.240 --> 24:29.800
but it's the last time.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.120
Look at the state this place is in,
it's a shit heap.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.520
You gotta imagine it all different.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.760
What's it gonna cost me?

24:45.840 --> 24:47.960
A hundred, 150.

24:52.760 --> 24:57.160
Your father can cough up cash
for a gypsy, but not for this place.

24:57.240 --> 25:01.200
Ask for something else.
He doesn't want to give you this.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.440
This was Mom's.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.080
I want this, not something else.

25:16.120 --> 25:18.520
Restaurant, disco, slot machines...

25:18.600 --> 25:21.000
you won't be able to do it
for less than 300,000.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.560
Numbers are your thing.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.960
You're going to run this place, not me.

25:31.360 --> 25:34.960
Apologize to the gypsy
and I'll talk to Dad.

25:35.680 --> 25:37.080
And we'll see what we can do.

25:39.840 --> 25:43.400
So we'll have something that's yours
and mine without that pain in the ass.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.560
The best club in Ostia.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.640
Make it right and I'll talk to Dad.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.760
Let's go, I'm cold.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.800
First, you talk to Dad.

26:00.880 --> 26:03.760
If he says yes,
I'll make it right with the gypsy.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.800
I'm cold, let's go.

26:10.240 --> 26:14.320
First thing we'll do is put in a walkway,
I'm ruining my shoes.

26:36.920 --> 26:40.280
What the fuck are you looking at?
I'm going to smash his face in.

26:41.080 --> 26:44.160
Go ahead!
You already did, didn't you? Remember?

26:44.240 --> 26:45.720
-Repeats are good.
-For what?

26:45.800 --> 26:48.080
-For my mood.
-Amedeo, what do you want?

26:48.160 --> 26:50.720
-Will the mayor change his mind?
-No.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.480
-Has the party got a candidate?
-Do you want to run?

26:53.560 --> 26:56.400
-You know you haven't got the profile.
-No, I don't know.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.600
I want the party to back me
and my battles.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.280
We always have.

27:01.360 --> 27:05.560
No, you've used me. The votes from
the outer boroughs were handy, huh?

27:05.640 --> 27:07.960
And then you tossed me
into a fucking commission.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.520
I don't recall you being this ambitious.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.040
I only want to make progress
with my ideas,

27:12.120 --> 27:14.600
that were once yours. His, who knows?

27:14.680 --> 27:15.880
What do you want?

27:17.800 --> 27:19.760
I want to be
in the top three on the ticket

27:19.840 --> 27:22.320
and if we win,
the department of social policy.

27:22.920 --> 27:26.560
I can't. The mayor chooses
the department chairs.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.240
Since when do you let him choose?

27:31.520 --> 27:33.800
You think I'm not good enough.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.520
-I've got to go.
-Why?

27:37.040 --> 27:40.600
Because true politics
is the art of what's possible

27:40.680 --> 27:42.960
and you're still here fighting
for the impossible.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.680
A poor loser with ideals.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.200
I'm a loser...

27:48.320 --> 27:49.560
Am I a loser, Gabriella?

27:58.480 --> 28:01.640
Theodosiou only listens
to Mrs. Monaschi now.

28:03.560 --> 28:06.360
I've got no power
in the commission anymore.

28:06.440 --> 28:09.640
Convince Theodosiou
to sell that land to us.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.520
The guys from the South
are behind this deal.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.080
You don't mess with the Mafia.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.120
You want to let them into Rome
through the front door.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.840
Eminence, you've been laundering
their money for 30 years.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.440
Mrs. Monaschi...

28:30.240 --> 28:33.240
MMA MUAY THAI BOXING

28:47.160 --> 28:48.200
Excuse me.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.440
Excuse me, are you Aureliano?

28:52.560 --> 28:54.800
-Who the fuck are you?
-Did Sergio call you?

28:55.800 --> 28:57.240
I asked who the fuck you are.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.200
Did Sergio call you or not?

29:02.280 --> 29:03.240
What do you want?

29:03.840 --> 29:05.120
I need some coke.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.120
Does it look like I'm working?

29:09.760 --> 29:11.640
-No, but...
-But, my ass...

29:14.320 --> 29:16.920
In here if you wanna talk,
you gotta put gloves on.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.240
-You're kidding?
-No.

29:21.200 --> 29:24.240
Adriano, bring this guy some gloves.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.120
-Keep your guard up.
-Easy!

29:37.040 --> 29:39.920
All right, like that.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.320
Come on.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.520
Look, he got me.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.280
Now we can talk.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.040
Sara, there's someone to see you.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.640
Who is it?

30:39.400 --> 30:41.680
I'm sorry to disturb you,

30:41.760 --> 30:44.400
but I was passing by
and I was curious to meet you.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.000
Meet me?

30:48.640 --> 30:50.680
I've heard a lot about you,

30:51.400 --> 30:54.320
about how you're on
that Vatican commission.

30:55.960 --> 30:57.560
Sit down.

30:59.800 --> 31:02.920
-What do you want from me?
-The land in Ostia.

31:04.160 --> 31:08.160
Those 20 acres that will be zoned
for building under the new plan

31:08.240 --> 31:10.680
and that the Vatican
is deciding who to sell to.

31:13.400 --> 31:17.360
I don't decide that. I'm only an auditor.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.640
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

31:19.720 --> 31:21.000
Mrs. Monaschi...

31:26.280 --> 31:29.160
I bet while you're checking
the Vatican accounts,

31:29.800 --> 31:33.120
that land will end up in the hands
of your husband's company.

31:34.960 --> 31:38.360
Rome is a very gossipy town,
word gets around.

31:39.320 --> 31:43.480
See? I knew where to find you,
and I'll know where to find you again,

31:44.520 --> 31:45.920
if need be.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.520
Think it over.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.480
Let me know how much you want
for the land.

31:53.160 --> 31:55.280
I can be very generous.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.120
Hey, Livia.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.760
Did you wanna tell me something?

32:16.040 --> 32:18.880
Aureliano's idea
about renovating Mom's kiosk...

32:18.960 --> 32:23.240
You wanna talk about your mother too?
I said to drop it.

32:23.320 --> 32:26.840
It's a good idea.
We can make a lot of money there.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.760
-No.
-Why?

32:30.960 --> 32:32.800
We're done.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.120
Samurai's interested in it.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.280
Samurai?

32:47.800 --> 32:49.640
What would Samurai do with it?

32:50.600 --> 32:53.920
Not just the beach, the whole area.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.520
The families from the South
wanna build a big port.

32:58.040 --> 33:00.880
-And what do we get out of it?
-What?

33:01.400 --> 33:03.280
We're here.

33:03.880 --> 33:07.040
If they really do build the port,
the coke comes in, goes out...

33:07.120 --> 33:09.200
Something comes our way too, right?

33:15.000 --> 33:16.640
Why didn't you tell Aureliano?

33:19.640 --> 33:22.160
Aureliano isn't ready
to know certain things.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.560
But you tell them to me.

33:26.440 --> 33:28.320
You're not like your brother.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.960
You'll see what a good impression
you'll make tonight.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.760
You have to be happy.

33:47.960 --> 33:51.240
We made a good choice,
Angelica's right for you.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.120
I want to see you happy, Alberto.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.440
A woman is the only way.

33:56.520 --> 33:57.840
Says who?

34:01.760 --> 34:03.000
[I say so.]

34:05.480 --> 34:09.000
[I know what you are. I understand.]

34:10.000 --> 34:11.239
And what am I?

34:11.920 --> 34:15.520
[What you are, whatever you are,]

34:16.400 --> 34:17.840
[you can't be that here,]

34:17.920 --> 34:20.400
[in this house, in this family...]

34:20.480 --> 34:22.080
[You can't!]

34:30.159 --> 34:32.600
This is the take from the northern zone.

34:36.880 --> 34:38.159
It's not much.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.719
He said no, didn't he?

34:50.360 --> 34:51.480
Why?

34:53.239 --> 34:55.199
He says it's not good business.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.880
Right, because it's my idea.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.680
No, that's not why.

35:04.280 --> 35:05.720
Why then?

35:06.640 --> 35:08.920
You need to make it right
with the gypsies.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.440
It's important.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.920
I couldn't give a shit.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.960
You don't wanna do it
because Dad asked you?

35:24.480 --> 35:25.760
Do it for me.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.480
Do it because I'm asking you to.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.200
Aureliano?

35:39.560 --> 35:40.800
Answer me.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.360
A hundred and we'll take our time.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.000
Let's go.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.640
Fuck you.

36:26.240 --> 36:30.080
-I know you're about to graduate.
-Only my dissertation to go.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.880
-Then what will you do?
-I don't know, we'll see.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.360
-What will he do after he graduates?
-Apply to the force.

36:36.440 --> 36:39.040
A cop? But that's a shit life.

36:39.120 --> 36:42.600
But not a cop like me and you,
he'll be a commanding officer.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.400
-An official.
-An official, yes.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.160
Sorry, I've got to go. Bye.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.760
-Thank you.
-All the best.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.200
-Thanks.
-All the best.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.040
Spadino?

37:16.120 --> 37:17.760
[Spadino's on his way.]

37:17.840 --> 37:18.960
[Let's go.]

37:35.320 --> 37:38.480
-Give me another one.
-Kid, that's your fifth.

37:38.560 --> 37:39.920
Go home.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.640
I said give me another one.

39:47.560 --> 39:51.000
[Is he drunk?]

40:18.840 --> 40:20.640
Go on, sing!

40:21.240 --> 40:22.520
Sing!

42:18.800 --> 42:21.480
Take care with the parking,
we don't want the usual mess.

42:21.560 --> 42:22.600
Right away.

42:23.160 --> 42:26.240
I'm glad you could come
on such short notice.

42:26.320 --> 42:29.400
Who could have imagined
the mayor would resign today?

42:29.480 --> 42:31.840
Countess, thank you for the invitation!

42:31.920 --> 42:33.800
Sandro, my dear.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.720
-You must be Sara.
-Good evening.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.480
All Rome is talking about you.

42:39.200 --> 42:41.560
A woman in the Vatican always makes news.

42:42.760 --> 42:45.320
-Can I steal her away for a moment?
-Of course.

42:48.360 --> 42:51.400
Sandro's a good boy, a bit too formal,

42:51.480 --> 42:53.760
but between the Jesuits and his mother...

42:54.800 --> 42:58.880
Look at them, the rich of Rome,
all builders, speculators...

42:59.760 --> 43:02.040
-Good evening.
-Countess...

43:02.120 --> 43:04.360
-Good evening, councilor.
-Good evening.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.480
The mayor has resigned,

43:06.560 --> 43:09.440
and they're all discussing the future
of the city.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.240
A pack of wolves around a bone.

43:14.680 --> 43:18.520
It can't be easy for a woman
to be on a commission like that,

43:19.320 --> 43:22.240
that manages Vatican property holdings
and finances.

43:22.320 --> 43:25.360
I'm just an auditor.
I don't have a decision-making role.

43:25.440 --> 43:28.640
For an intelligent person like you,
listening's enough.

43:28.720 --> 43:30.200
Your husband knows this.

43:30.280 --> 43:33.280
He wouldn't know which way
to turn without you.

43:33.360 --> 43:37.040
And the investors backing his company
know it as well.

43:37.120 --> 43:39.240
Especially in this situation.

43:39.760 --> 43:41.000
What situation?

43:41.080 --> 43:43.040
The Ostia landholdings.

43:43.640 --> 43:47.640
Before, everyone wanted them,
now there's someone claiming them,

43:47.720 --> 43:49.920
someone all Rome's afraid of,

43:50.000 --> 43:51.480
because of what he might do,

43:51.560 --> 43:53.840
but especially
because of what he might say.

43:55.080 --> 43:57.520
I think I met him today.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.000
I'm not surprised.

44:00.600 --> 44:04.400
You're dealing with the person
who's always decided everything in Rome.

44:07.080 --> 44:09.520
It's up to you
to decide whether to pass...

44:10.040 --> 44:11.720
or risk it.

44:21.920 --> 44:24.840
They've just arrived from Sicily,
but it's only the son.

44:38.840 --> 44:40.000
And your father?

44:40.600 --> 44:41.760
Had stuff to do.

44:44.480 --> 44:47.240
The mayor's resignation,
what does it mean?

44:47.320 --> 44:49.880
Nothing, I just need to speed things up.

44:50.440 --> 44:52.680
But we still haven't got the Vatican land.

44:53.240 --> 44:54.800
It's only a matter of time.

44:57.120 --> 44:58.280
You've had time.

45:00.200 --> 45:01.800
I created this deal,

45:02.520 --> 45:04.720
I know how to manage Rome and its timing.

45:07.160 --> 45:09.280
Hear that? The mouse that roared.

45:09.360 --> 45:11.600
But he's forgotten that the money's ours.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.920
Maybe he's getting old...

45:17.520 --> 45:19.080
and forgetting things.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.520
But my father says
you're a man of your word.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.080
Your father is a good judge of men.

45:27.440 --> 45:30.200
Then don't disappoint him. Let's go.

46:08.720 --> 46:09.680
Darling.

46:09.760 --> 46:13.360
Today at school everyone was talking about
this thing with the mayor.

46:15.120 --> 46:17.000
I even argued with the principal.

46:17.880 --> 46:18.880
How come?

46:19.680 --> 46:22.560
Two teachers are sick

46:23.440 --> 46:25.800
and they didn't have money
for substitutes.

46:25.880 --> 46:28.720
So they sent Fabrizio into a class
with bigger kids,

46:28.800 --> 46:32.040
except he kicked up a fuss,
and I had to go get him.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.960
What's that got to do with the principal?

46:36.040 --> 46:38.400
She says City Hall makes the cuts.

46:39.520 --> 46:43.000
She says to ask you, that maybe...

46:43.080 --> 46:46.160
You know I don't do those things.
I don't ask for favors.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.880
Yes, I know, of course.

46:52.480 --> 46:55.600
Anyway, I took him to work with me.

47:00.360 --> 47:03.720
Worst comes to worst,
he can come make perfume with me.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.360
Sure.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.480
Mommy!

47:20.120 --> 47:21.840
-I'll go in.
-I'll be right there.

49:05.600 --> 49:07.200
Isn't that asshole coming?

49:32.960 --> 49:33.960
Well?

49:49.440 --> 49:50.320
Here.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.840
I think I did you a favor.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.040
With that thing on your nose,

50:09.120 --> 50:11.600
you can't smell the shit stink
you carry around.

50:14.920 --> 50:16.400
A tip for services rendered.

50:18.400 --> 50:19.240
[Let's roll.]

50:39.760 --> 50:40.800
Fuck!

50:46.320 --> 50:49.800
Good evening.
There's a room downstairs to get changed.

51:02.840 --> 51:06.400
Sergio, your friend didn't show up
and he's not answering his phone.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.840
I can't wait because people are arriving.

51:11.040 --> 51:12.680
Find me a solution.

51:14.520 --> 51:15.760
Yeah, it's all good.

51:16.440 --> 51:18.160
He didn't let out a peep.

51:22.120 --> 51:26.920
When evening falls

51:27.000 --> 51:33.640
You talk to me of love

51:33.720 --> 51:40.200
And looking into my eyes

51:40.280 --> 51:44.720
You make me feel like a woman
Who's a bit porno...

51:44.800 --> 51:47.480
Porno... porno...

53:34.520 --> 53:35.520
Come on.

54:24.720 --> 54:26.840
You gotta learn how to get by
in this world.

54:26.920 --> 54:29.960
You're acting like a clown.

54:31.040 --> 54:33.080
You can't teach me a fuckin' thing.

54:33.160 --> 54:35.240
You made me look like an asshole.

54:35.320 --> 54:38.040
You showed up plastered the night
of your engagement.

54:38.120 --> 54:41.120
Do you realize what this marriage means
for our family?

54:41.200 --> 54:42.360
For us? For you!

54:44.160 --> 54:46.800
Meanwhile, you need to go to a villa

54:46.880 --> 54:49.400
and pick up the cash for a delivery.
Move your ass.

54:49.480 --> 54:52.000
You gotta realize you can't do
what the fuck you want.

54:52.080 --> 54:54.880
Good, I prefer working
after this boring shit.

55:06.840 --> 55:07.760
Shut up.

55:10.640 --> 55:14.560
Shut up or I'll throw you out of the car.

55:38.680 --> 55:42.240
-Look, it's all there.
-Yeah, but I'll count it anyway.

55:51.600 --> 55:53.720
What's this asshole doing here?

55:53.800 --> 55:56.320
I called you three times,
you almost made me...

55:56.400 --> 56:00.520
Piece of shit, put it there
and don't move, or I'll bust your ass.

56:01.840 --> 56:04.520
I've fuckin' had it with you.
Get out, you gypsy asshole.

56:04.600 --> 56:08.160
I'll go where the fuck I want...

56:12.200 --> 56:13.640
Who the fuck's this?

56:14.960 --> 56:18.480
-How much did he do?
-It's that shit you sell.

56:18.560 --> 56:22.600
-Will you help me get him up?
-No, leave him on his side.

56:22.680 --> 56:24.280
Leave him alone.

56:24.360 --> 56:25.800
What the fuck do I do now?

56:27.680 --> 56:30.160
Call an ambulance, he's gonna croak.

56:30.720 --> 56:32.880
Stop making a big deal,
he's not going to die.

56:33.520 --> 56:36.400
Why don't you wanna call an ambulance?
Who the fuck is he?

56:36.480 --> 56:39.600
He's a priest, fuck it.
I can't call an ambulance.

56:39.680 --> 56:40.880
He's a priest?

56:43.000 --> 56:44.920
My friend, this guy's a priest?

56:45.000 --> 56:47.720
And how big is he?
The bigger he is the more he's worth...

56:47.800 --> 56:49.160
He snorts, fucks and ODs.

56:49.240 --> 56:51.840
The bigger deal he is,
the more he'll pay to cover it up.

56:51.920 --> 56:52.880
It's Gabriele.

56:52.960 --> 56:55.200
-Who's he calling?
-How the fuck do I know?

56:55.280 --> 56:58.920
Something bad's happened, the priest OD'd.

57:01.600 --> 57:02.960
I didn't do anything.

57:04.240 --> 57:07.360
-Are you spying?
-I'll keep my mouth shut, don't worry.

57:07.440 --> 57:10.040
-What have you got there?
-Mind your own business.

57:15.160 --> 57:17.240
Is it my fault if he OD'd?

57:19.080 --> 57:20.800
Making a little movie, were you?

57:22.240 --> 57:24.280
Give me my phone.

57:24.360 --> 57:26.600
You were going to
ask him for money, bitch.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.040
Don't move.

57:34.240 --> 57:36.840
Tonight,
we're gonna take you for everything.

57:36.920 --> 57:40.440
-The priest was getting his rocks off...
-Check it out.

57:40.520 --> 57:43.080
-You went for it, huh?
-They're coming to get him.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.080
Good, you can tell me
where they take him.

57:45.920 --> 57:47.600
Guys, there's a problem.

57:48.800 --> 57:52.520
-The idea's mine, the priest's mine.
-But I've got the phone.

57:54.760 --> 57:56.600
The priest is mine.

57:56.680 --> 57:59.280
-You want to blackmail the priest?
-Shut up.

58:00.760 --> 58:02.560
Spadino, careful or I'll hurt you.

58:02.640 --> 58:05.240
I'll explain again, the priest's mine.

58:05.320 --> 58:07.120
If you like, I'll give you a cut, 5%.

58:07.200 --> 58:09.640
Give 5% to your parasite brother,

58:09.720 --> 58:11.880
your family's not even fit
to wipe our ass.

58:11.960 --> 58:13.920
Go fuck yourself!

58:15.200 --> 58:16.800
I'm gonna bust your ass!

58:19.640 --> 58:21.160
I want a third of the money.

58:25.560 --> 58:27.800
I'm not done with you...
What did you say?

58:27.880 --> 58:30.520
We'll blackmail the priest,
but I want a third.

58:31.160 --> 58:33.960
I can tell you who he is,
how important he is.

58:34.040 --> 58:35.400
But we split it three ways.

58:37.440 --> 58:38.720
Well?

58:38.800 --> 58:42.000
Well, my ass... Now he's talking too.

58:42.080 --> 58:44.920
They're coming to get him,
hurry up and decide.

58:45.920 --> 58:48.840
He's important enough for three?

58:48.920 --> 58:51.440
-He's big.
-I don't give a fuck.

58:51.520 --> 58:53.800
-Why?
-I'm not doing shit with you two.

58:53.880 --> 58:56.360
We each take a cut,

58:57.040 --> 58:59.320
then everyone does
what the fuck they want.

59:06.520 --> 59:07.600
Well?

59:10.600 --> 59:11.600
You in?

59:26.160 --> 59:27.960
