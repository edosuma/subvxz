WEBVTT

00:26.568 --> 00:27.736
You, uh, want some help?

00:30.071 --> 00:31.531
No, I'm good.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.408
Seriously.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.286
Let him help.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.434
-It's a perimeter fence.

00:59.934 --> 01:02.896
Like we had back at home
when things got, uh...

01:02.979 --> 01:06.274
Except this one's
not meant to keep out people.

01:10.570 --> 01:14.365
So, uh, your mom and I,
we're gonna be heading out.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.495
We're gonna check whether anyone else
has had better luck

01:18.578 --> 01:20.580
contacting the<i> Resolute</i> than we have.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.333
This will keep you safe while we're gone.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.503
We're already safe. We've got him.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.423
Maybe.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.512
Look, we don't know what it is yet.

01:36.179 --> 01:40.058
We don't know anything about Dr. Smith,
but you're not worried about her.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.726
Yeah, well, that's different.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.727
Why?

01:43.186 --> 01:46.981
Well, she can't hammer metal stakes
into the ground like they're toothpicks.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.948
Let's talk about this later, hmm?

01:57.033 --> 02:01.121
Why don't you and your sisters
start the Jupiter expansion protocols?

02:01.913 --> 02:03.790
Looks like we might be here for a while.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.613
<i>Welcome to Alpha Centauri.</i>

02:36.114 --> 02:38.158
<i>Welcome to your new life.</i>

02:38.950 --> 02:44.247
<i>It's been a long journey for you.</i>
<i>Almost 26 trillion miles.</i>

02:44.330 --> 02:45.790
<i>But you are home now.</i>

02:46.040 --> 02:47.834
<i>-You've joined a community...</i>
-I like it here.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.502
<i>...of the best and brightest...</i>

02:49.586 --> 02:52.213
Look at these people.
Everyone's abs are so well-defined.

02:52.297 --> 02:56.968
<i>...dedicated to building a society</i>
<i>that will last generations to come.</i>

02:59.888 --> 03:01.764
<i>Please begin expansion now.</i>

03:05.018 --> 03:07.562
Okay, let's get this over with.

03:11.733 --> 03:18.031
<i>It's time to explore, time to discover,</i>
<i>time to breathe.</i>

03:19.991 --> 03:21.075
Expansion guides.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.577
Check.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.456
"Oh, no, yeah, Mom, I would love
to stay here and do 80 boring chores

03:26.539 --> 03:28.416
while you get to go out
and meet new survivors."

03:28.499 --> 03:30.543
-Check.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.962
"Oh, Judy, you should go, too.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.173
Just in case someone needs you
to do something heroic."

03:36.174 --> 03:37.342
Activate expansion.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.594
<i>Clear immediate surroundings.</i>

03:47.977 --> 03:49.687
<i>Expansion failure.</i>

03:52.523 --> 03:53.650
Leave this to me.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.522
Whoo! Yeah!

04:33.106 --> 04:35.108
Woo-hoo!

04:38.820 --> 04:39.737
All right.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.826
That was really something.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.835
He never leaves your side, does he?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.588
Not really.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.132
So protective.

05:01.092 --> 05:04.429
I wish I had a friend like that.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.224
Have you asked
if there are more like him out there?

05:09.600 --> 05:10.852
He doesn't talk much.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.938
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

05:15.315 --> 05:19.902
The lights in his face, the way
they change? I think he's saying a lot.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.656
We just don't know how to hear him yet.

05:25.575 --> 05:29.370
As a therapist,
it's part of my job to read people,

05:30.163 --> 05:31.581
know what they're thinking.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.252
If you'd like,
I could spend some time studying him.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.672
That's okay. Thank you.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.091
That's nice.

05:43.009 --> 05:43.885
What is?

05:43.968 --> 05:45.845
You're protective of him, too.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.737
Let's hope the radio on the
Watanabes' Jupiter works better than ours.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.990
We need to talk to the<i> Resolute.</i>

06:06.866 --> 06:09.327
-Let them know our situation.
-Hmm.

06:13.539 --> 06:14.707
What you looking at?

06:15.625 --> 06:16.918
Nothing.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.588
Just trying to get my bearings.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.636
Oh, hey, before we get there,
nothing about the robot, okay?

06:27.386 --> 06:30.098
I shouldn't tell Hiroki?
Hiroki's an exobiologist.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.476
He's literally an expert in alien biology.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.894
It's not Hiroki I'm worried about.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.521
Bear left here.

06:36.854 --> 06:40.149
It's who he talks to
and then who they talk to.

06:40.233 --> 06:44.112
We don't know how people
are gonna react to it. Or it to them.

06:46.072 --> 06:49.075
The truth will come out eventually.
It always does.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.419
I see.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.170
Astounding.

07:02.547 --> 07:03.923
How strange it is.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.716
No. How familiar.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.845
It moved with muscular contraction.
It ate.

07:10.346 --> 07:13.141
It evidenced both a fear
and a pleasure reflex.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.229
The universe is a big place.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.315
I imagine things get
far stranger than that.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.954
They've arrived.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.790
-I'm so glad!

07:37.874 --> 07:40.626
Maureen.
-Hi... Hiroki.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.628
Glad to see you safe.
Good to see you.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.590
So relieved to see you.
Have you heard from the<i> Resolute?</i>

07:45.673 --> 07:46.591
You okay?

07:46.674 --> 07:48.259
-We're fine.
Was a rough landing.

07:48.342 --> 07:52.180
Okay. Get back here. Get back here.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.598
Haven't you learned?

07:54.515 --> 07:56.767
Only terrible things happen
when we go outside.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.274
Hey. Hi. Don West.
Which one of you guys is the doctor?

08:03.357 --> 08:04.984
I am. Is the patient inside?

08:05.651 --> 08:08.154
-Eighteen.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.618
-You know, I can find my own way.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.412
Don West. I'm the one who saved her life.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.457
In case you were wondering
who else saves lives around here.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.917
I wasn't really.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.545
I found the ejector seat
and promptly administered first aid,

08:28.299 --> 08:31.219
She's awake now.
Not that it makes much of a difference.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.725
They say she's the doctor.

08:40.061 --> 08:43.314
My name is Judy Robinson.
Can you tell me yours?

08:44.232 --> 08:45.775
She hasn't said a word.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.245
Hey.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.581
You've been through a lot.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.502
I guess we all have.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.048
<i>Do you have any idea </i>
<i>what happened up on the</i> Resolute?

09:09.131 --> 09:10.883
No. Nothing yet. So how many of us are there?

09:13.135 --> 09:15.513
-There are 63 survivors.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.557
Twenty-seven.

09:20.935 --> 09:24.230
We were able to map the locations
of 12 Jupiters before we landed.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.024
Thirteen now, including yours.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.528
And not one of these ships can take off?

09:31.028 --> 09:32.655
Methanogenic chordates.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.282
The eels.

09:34.949 --> 09:40.788
They metabolize hydrocarbons.
We are all quite stranded.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.376
Okay, what about the...

09:45.459 --> 09:48.921
What's the technical term for the thing
in the bathroom that recycles the...

09:49.005 --> 09:51.007
-Thermal degradation reactor.
-Yeah.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.801
For us to produce enough bodily waste
to get a Jupiter into orbit

09:53.884 --> 09:55.011
would take years.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.597
Excuse me. They're in range.

10:02.768 --> 10:03.728
Here.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.481
<i>This is Captain Radic</i>
<i>broadcasting from the </i>Resolute.

10:08.149 --> 10:11.569
<i>It's day three, 1400 hours.</i>

10:11.652 --> 10:15.698
<i>Resolute,</i> this is Naoko Watanabe
of the<i> Jupiter 11.</i> Please respond.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.033
<i>Repairs are proceeding.</i>

10:17.450 --> 10:19.327
<i>We've identified and sealed all leaks--</i>

10:19.410 --> 10:24.123
<i>Resolute,</i> this is Naoko Watanabe
of the <i>Jupiter 11.</i> Please respond.

10:27.835 --> 10:30.838
You can't reach them either.
They should be receiving our signals.

10:30.921 --> 10:33.674
You said these were Jupiter locations?

10:34.091 --> 10:35.718
Yes. Why?

10:35.801 --> 10:37.470
This one isn't a Jupiter.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.973
There's something else out there.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.113
I'm not gonna hurt you. I promise.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.335
I'm gonna give you something
to help with the pain.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.398
Angela.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.112
It's nice to meet you, Angela.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.451
The image is hard to make out,
but it's definitely man-made.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.120
Maybe that's part of the<i> Resolute.</i>

11:45.496 --> 11:47.331
One of the outer storage modules.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.458
There could be equipment there.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.087
Something we could use
to amplify our broadcast

11:53.170 --> 11:55.798
so they could hear us.
A synthesizer, at the very least.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.925
Let's go take a look.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.760
-Mmm-hmm.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.303
Hey! I'll come, too.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.556
Uh, no. We're okay.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.599
Okay, sure, I get it.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.270
To get the comm supplies,
you go to F level, aft bay.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.522
Make three rights
and then hook the second left.

12:11.605 --> 12:15.401
It's compartment 46.
Or you could just bring me with you.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.160
I mean, it's really smart of you
to bring me along.

12:24.702 --> 12:28.456
Seriously, credit to both of you.
You didn't hesitate.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.876
You said, "You know what? We gotta
find our way. We need Don West.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.170
-'Cause the two of us alone--"
-Penny, Will.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.130
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

12:39.341 --> 12:40.551
<i>Are you there?</i>

12:42.553 --> 12:45.014
Yeah, I'm here, Mom.
Where else would I be?

12:45.097 --> 12:47.099
Your dad and I
need to recover some equipment,

12:47.183 --> 12:49.268
so we won't be back for a while.

12:49.351 --> 12:52.146
Okay. And when do I
get to get some fresh air?

12:52.229 --> 12:55.483
If you need to leave the Jupiter,
which you shouldn't,

12:55.566 --> 12:57.026
stay behind the fence.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.695
<i>And Judy will be back soon</i>
<i>to look after you.</i>

12:59.778 --> 13:01.822
Since when do I need a babysitter?

13:01.906 --> 13:04.408
Since we were attacked by giant eels.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.913
<i>Who knows what else is on this planet.</i>
<i>Just stay behind the fence. Both of you.</i>

13:18.839 --> 13:20.299
How did this happen?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.594
It was an attack.

13:23.677 --> 13:24.678
What was?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.559
You can tell me.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.314
It wasn't an accident.

13:36.857 --> 13:40.694
The<i> Resolute...</i> it was attacked.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.905
Attacked?

13:45.199 --> 13:46.200
By who?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.331
Hey, have you seen my parents?

13:52.414 --> 13:55.292
They went for supplies.
Said to take the Chariot home.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.002
Look after brother and sister.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.462
Okay, thank you.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.297
-Yeah.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.729
Guess who?

14:22.319 --> 14:25.239
You're right. It's missing something.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.673
What are you drawing?

14:50.764 --> 14:51.682
An eight?

14:52.933 --> 14:54.894
You wouldn't know
what an eight looks like.

15:07.573 --> 15:11.327
A headless snowman with five dots.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.707
This appears to be
the first known work of art of an artificial intelligence
of alien origin.

15:20.961 --> 15:23.589
Medium, dirt from unknown planet.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.217
What would you like to call
your masterpiece?

15:29.887 --> 15:31.055
Danger.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.687
Let's try something else.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.405
It's called tic-tac-toe.

15:55.579 --> 15:56.413
Will.

16:01.543 --> 16:04.129
-Uh...

16:07.758 --> 16:08.801
Alone.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.435
What is it?

16:20.145 --> 16:24.400
I just saw a patient.
She told me what happened on the<i> Resolute.</i>

16:25.985 --> 16:27.569
She said we were attacked.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.321
By a thing with four arms,

16:29.405 --> 16:32.324
blades all over its skin,
a glowing red face.

16:33.575 --> 16:36.370
Of course, I wondered
what she was talking about.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.206
Until she said it was like
some kind of robot.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.130
Oh, my God.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.049
-You knew.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.468
-To call Mom and Dad.
-You can't.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.636
It's dangerous.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.764
-He's different now.
-It's not a he, Will. It's an it.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.474
He saved your life.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.813
Hey, missed you.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.746
<i>J2 </i>to Chariot 11.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.835
<i>J2</i> to Chariot 11. Anybody

17:28.922 --> 17:31.967
Hey. Where you going?

17:35.220 --> 17:36.889
Oh, I'm just...

17:40.517 --> 17:42.144
...going to collect more stuff.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.189
You think that's a good idea?

17:45.272 --> 17:47.191
Your mom said
to stay inside the perimeter.

17:47.524 --> 17:50.736
Yeah, but I'll be safe.
I'm taking the robot.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.406
Oh, hey, don't forget your map.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.458
-Don't tell your parents.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.377
I was 11 once, too.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.046
Thanks.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.457
Finders keepers.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.587
Dad

18:52.297 --> 18:54.133
Why isn't this thing working?

18:54.216 --> 18:57.511
It's working fine. It's just
resetting itself after the power spike.

18:57.594 --> 18:58.846
Power spike?

18:59.263 --> 19:03.016
Yeah. Takes, like,
30 minutes to come back on.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.437
Is this about Will

19:07.521 --> 19:08.605
He what?

19:08.689 --> 19:09.982
Yeah, with the robot.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.068
The perimeter fence is turned off.

19:14.611 --> 19:15.946
What's going on?

19:18.824 --> 19:20.284
You gonna say it?

19:22.286 --> 19:23.370
Okay, then.

19:25.622 --> 19:26.582
No danger.

19:27.958 --> 19:28.876
Yet.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.679
Will!

19:40.762 --> 19:42.514
Come on, it's okay.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.058
Hey, you can't be out here!
Get back inside.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.686
So we can wait around until you tell Dad?
No, thanks.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.980
Wait.

19:51.064 --> 19:54.276
We've all been wondering
what happened with the<i> Resolute.</i>

19:54.359 --> 19:55.569
Why we crashed here.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.613
And now the reason
is standing right next to you.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.407
-Because he's changed.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.910
-That's not good enough.

20:02.993 --> 20:08.207
Believing has nothing to do with it, Will.
It is about me protecting you.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.209
He's protecting me.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.794
And what if it changes again?

20:15.839 --> 20:17.549
Will, stop.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.640
Don't you always say
that people make mistakes sometimes,

20:24.723 --> 20:27.184
and that they deserve a second chance?

20:29.770 --> 20:31.313
Maybe people do, but--

20:31.647 --> 20:33.857
He's more like us than you think.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.611
Look, there's a cave
a few miles in this direction.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.781
Let me hide him away there.
That way everyone's safe from everyone.

20:40.864 --> 20:43.116
Isn't that what you want anyway?

20:45.786 --> 20:48.497
Look, Judy, I'm not crazy.

20:49.873 --> 20:52.000
I know we're gonna have
to tell Dad the truth.

20:53.001 --> 20:56.797
Just... let me be the one to do it.

21:01.802 --> 21:02.678
Guys!

21:06.390 --> 21:08.600
You guys realize
we're on the wrong side of the fence?

21:09.226 --> 21:11.520
So whatever's going on here,
I think it's great.

21:13.897 --> 21:14.982
Or not.

21:22.906 --> 21:23.907
Hello?

21:26.034 --> 21:28.912
Okay, someone is gonna tell me
what's going on, though, right?

21:44.553 --> 21:47.723
Ugh, I'd feel better if Debbie was here.
For luck.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.726
I think she's better off
being looked after by my daughter.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.227
Oh, no, that's Angela.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.981
-The chicken.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.694
-You only met one chicken.

22:00.777 --> 22:03.238
Any chicken that saves my life
deserves a name.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.531
Okay, I'm listening.

22:04.614 --> 22:06.825
It turns out she has a locator chip
on her ankle.

22:06.908 --> 22:09.745
All livestock have that.
That's how the Watanabes found us,

22:09.828 --> 22:13.415
a moment before an entire desert
of black death almost dumped on my head.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.375
That is a lucky chicken.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.172
Kind of wish she was here now.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.848
What could have caused a piece this size
to break off the<i> Resolute</i>?

22:29.931 --> 22:31.808
I don't know. Meteor?

22:32.934 --> 22:36.563
I've always hated meteors. Always.
I'm on record for it.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.732
A meteor didn't cause this.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.406
So what did?

22:52.662 --> 22:54.915
So do you believe him?

22:55.707 --> 22:57.292
What

22:57.834 --> 23:00.295
Yeah. I mean,
it's been pretty helpful so far.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.506
If it did something bad once,
it can do it again.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.383
Okay, then what are we doing?

23:04.466 --> 23:06.009
Helping our brother hide that thing.

23:06.093 --> 23:09.096
And then I'm gonna tell Dad
exactly where it is.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.348
Will's right.

23:11.431 --> 23:14.434
Say what you want about our father,
but he knows how to handle a problem.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.356
Hey, come on. You're flagging.
Have something to eat.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.153
Check it out.

23:26.988 --> 23:27.823
Huh?

23:33.078 --> 23:34.579
It's beautiful.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.335
This is so cool.

24:00.522 --> 24:01.648
What was that?

24:02.482 --> 24:04.317
Danger, Will Robinson.

24:04.734 --> 24:07.362
-Okay, we shouldn't be out here.
Yup.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.281
-Come on.
Yeah, let's get moving.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.418
I don't know.
Maybe we should turn back.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.587
Will, how much farther
to the cave?

24:23.670 --> 24:24.880
-Okay.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.549
-Less than a mile.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.926
Listen.

24:30.510 --> 24:32.554
I think something's out there. Run!

24:35.765 --> 24:36.766
Whoa.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.519
Okay.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.021
Is there another way around?

24:41.104 --> 24:43.690
-Doesn't seem to be.
There's nowhere to go.

24:43.773 --> 24:45.066
Where's the robot?

24:52.866 --> 24:55.243
See? Useful.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.996
Okay. Okay.
-Come on. Come on, Penny.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.374
-Go slow.
Careful.  Okay. Okay.
-Slow.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.110
Yeah!

25:29.194 --> 25:31.321
Careful, hey!
Careful, Will!

25:31.404 --> 25:33.365
-Sorry.
-Watch out, Will.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.075
-Sorry.
Okay.

25:35.158 --> 25:36.117
Yeah!

25:41.790 --> 25:42.999
Keep going.

25:47.712 --> 25:48.964
Keep your balance. Come on.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.682
Have you guys found anything yet?

25:58.765 --> 26:02.644
Uh, no. There's, uh, nothing here.

26:03.186 --> 26:04.396
What about you

26:04.479 --> 26:06.898
No. Just some 3-D printer spools.

26:08.483 --> 26:11.278
Anybody need a coffee cup?
Got, like, a million of them.

26:11.861 --> 26:12.779
Catch.

26:17.367 --> 26:23.373
Hey, you've been there a few times, right?
Alpha Centauri. What's... What's it like?

26:23.456 --> 26:26.960
It might be billed as the promised land,
but they don't have everything there,

26:27.043 --> 26:28.962
so start adjusting your expectations.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.589
Like, uh, what don't they have?

26:31.673 --> 26:34.634
For starters, they don't have peat
from the Orkney Islands.

26:34.718 --> 26:37.178
Can't have paradise
without quality whiskey.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.390
The real problem with your colony
is the people.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.893
You travel across
millions of miles of space

26:43.977 --> 26:45.854
and everybody thinks
it's gonna be so different.

26:46.229 --> 26:49.316
Whatever people think
that they're running away from on Earth,

26:49.399 --> 26:52.235
they're just bringing it all with them.

26:59.701 --> 27:02.120
-Hey! I found it.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.538
It's over here.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.791
Oh! No, no, no. Wait a minute.
That might not be the...

27:09.044 --> 27:10.462
What the hell is this?

27:11.296 --> 27:12.630
Well, that's whiskey.

27:12.714 --> 27:15.425
Okay, don't be angry...

27:16.843 --> 27:19.220
but, uh, this is my stuff.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.305
You're a smuggler?

27:20.388 --> 27:22.640
Ah, I mean, that's just a nasty word.

27:22.724 --> 27:28.563
You know, I would say a merchant
of goods and products... and beverages.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.899
You ditched the back-up
frequency synthesizers

27:30.982 --> 27:32.359
so you could store your stash?

27:32.442 --> 27:35.195
Why didn't you use the box
with the cups in it?

27:35.278 --> 27:38.698
-Again, with your choice of words--
-We needed them!

27:57.133 --> 27:59.636
In your experience,
does she forget about things quickly,

27:59.719 --> 28:01.137
or does she tend to stay mad?

28:01.221 --> 28:03.848
You knew the synthesizers weren't here
before we left.

28:03.932 --> 28:07.352
But to be fair, before we left,
I didn't know what they were.

28:08.937 --> 28:09.813
John.

28:11.147 --> 28:11.981
Yeah?

28:17.362 --> 28:18.696
What is it?

28:21.157 --> 28:24.619
There's the reason they haven't been able
to hear our broadcasts.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.039
They never will.

28:32.293 --> 28:34.838
Okay, listen. I can explain this. So are we doing like an IOU, or...

28:41.761 --> 28:43.972
Okay. Well, this one's on me.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.895
My, what strong hands you have.

29:18.047 --> 29:21.050
No. No, no, no, no no.
It doesn't work like that.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.219
There aren't flowers everywhere.

29:24.095 --> 29:27.640
These are rocks. Flowers grow in dirt.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.560
Hey, that cave isn't
too much farther, right?

29:31.227 --> 29:33.438
We gotta go before Mom and Dad get home.
Penny!

29:40.862 --> 29:43.490
When we get to Alpha Centauri,
you think they'll trade us up

29:43.573 --> 29:45.992
for one of those family dwelling units
in town?

29:46.451 --> 29:48.369
I'm not sure, exactly.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.749
Okay. I mean,
living in the Jupiter's fine.

29:52.832 --> 29:54.709
That's... It's okay.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.921
You can have my room if you want.
Where are you gonna sleep?

29:58.004 --> 30:00.298
Well, there's lodging
at the medical facilities.

30:01.841 --> 30:03.259
Wait, you're moving out?

30:03.343 --> 30:05.261
Let's tighten it up.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.350
Come on, hide.
We can't let them see the robot.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.061
You have to pick up the pace.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.605
My Jupiter's only another six kilometers
from here.

30:15.688 --> 30:18.900
It's hard not to get distracted.
Did you see those Marchantiophyta?

30:18.983 --> 30:20.777
No, hide!
-No, get back.

30:20.860 --> 30:22.529
...if they even are Marchantiophyta--

30:22.612 --> 30:25.031
We can continue this
when we're safe at my camp.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.115
I recognize that guy.

30:26.199 --> 30:30.203
-That's our colony representative.
-Pretty sure Mom voted for the other guy.

30:30.286 --> 30:33.206
-I'm coming, Dad.

30:45.176 --> 30:47.220
Hey, get down.
I'm down.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.391
Okay. It's okay. Okay.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.893
Hey. I think someone dropped this.

30:54.477 --> 30:57.564
What is it?
-It's an envelope.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.691
Should we open it?

30:59.774 --> 31:01.150
No, it's not ours.

31:03.486 --> 31:05.113
Hey.
-Hi.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.781
Where are you guys coming from?

31:07.031 --> 31:08.908
Are you with the Jupiter we passed back...

31:09.701 --> 31:12.328
Hey, that's mine.
Sorry, I'm gonna need that back.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.831
Oh! What

31:15.623 --> 31:16.749
Seriously, give it back.

31:19.836 --> 31:22.046
-Get down!
Oh, my God!

31:22.130 --> 31:25.758
Hey!
Okay. It's okay. He's with us.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.641
-It's kind of a long story.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.019
-It's not that long.
-It is when you tell it.

31:36.102 --> 31:37.812
Hey! Hey, Dad--

31:37.896 --> 31:38.813
Okay!

31:38.897 --> 31:40.189
-Here's the thing.
-Hey!

31:40.273 --> 31:42.191
We're gonna need you
to keep this quiet, okay?

31:42.275 --> 31:44.402
My dad is in charge.
He needs to know about this.

31:44.485 --> 31:48.031
No, actually, your dad's in charge
on Alpha Centauri.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.991
When we get there,
tell him whatever you want.

31:50.325 --> 31:54.704
Until that point,
this needs to stay our little secret.

31:54.787 --> 31:56.164
-I don't trust him.
I do.

31:56.247 --> 31:57.081
Why's that?

31:57.165 --> 32:02.670
Because if whatever's in this
is as important as it seems,

32:02.754 --> 32:04.380
he's gonna do what we say.

32:05.632 --> 32:06.758
Do we have a deal?

32:09.886 --> 32:10.887
Okay.

32:24.275 --> 32:27.570
-I didn't think we'd run into anybody.
-Just come on. Let's get this over with.

32:27.654 --> 32:28.696
Please.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.493
Hurry up.
I'm coming.

33:11.864 --> 33:12.740
Whoa.

33:15.034 --> 33:17.328
You think...
think he'll be okay here?

33:23.001 --> 33:26.421
Yeah. Yeah, I think he'll be fine.

33:32.885 --> 33:34.095
It's getting late.

33:37.682 --> 33:38.599
We need to head back.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.314
<i>Hey, guys, where are you?</i>

33:46.899 --> 33:47.859
<i>Guys?</i>

33:49.777 --> 33:51.362
Why is nobody answering
at the Jupiter?

33:53.906 --> 33:57.285
No, we're here.
We're here, but, uh, we're busy.

34:01.998 --> 34:04.250
<i>Okay, are your sisters there?</i>

34:04.333 --> 34:08.629
Hey, Mom, sorry. We're, uh...
We are actually outside right now.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.424
We are checking and securing the pop-outs.

34:12.300 --> 34:15.053
It doesn't look like your dad and I
are gonna get back tonight.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.763
Why

34:16.846 --> 34:18.681
<i>We've run into a bit of car trouble.</i>

34:18.765 --> 34:19.891
Try it again.

34:19.974 --> 34:23.102
No. Somehow that's worse.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.689
That's what I was afraid of.

34:27.023 --> 34:30.318
You wouldn't be the first colonist
to accidentally drain the batteries.

34:30.485 --> 34:31.652
Are you saying it's my fault?

34:32.320 --> 34:33.946
<i>There's not enough daylight left</i>

34:34.030 --> 34:35.990
<i>to get a full recharge</i>
<i>from the solar cells.</i>

34:36.699 --> 34:39.535
So, I don't think we'll be back
till morning.

34:39.619 --> 34:42.580
Don't forget to double check the perimeter
before you shut down.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.123
Yeah, we already did.

34:44.207 --> 34:47.794
I feel a little better leaving you guys,
knowing that the robot's there.

34:48.377 --> 34:49.879
Yeah, about that...

34:53.466 --> 34:54.383
<i>About what?</i>

34:58.262 --> 34:59.514
<i>Judy, are you there? </i>

35:02.475 --> 35:03.351
<i>Judy?</i>

35:03.976 --> 35:06.229
We'll talk about it when you get back.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.649
-Bye, Mom.
<i>-Uh, I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

35:18.491 --> 35:22.662
So, maybe now that we're not in a hurry,

35:22.745 --> 35:25.790
we could stick around a little bit longer.

35:25.873 --> 35:28.000
Yeah. It's getting dark outside

35:28.084 --> 35:31.379
and if it's this dangerous during the day,
I don't wanna see what it's like at night.

35:34.799 --> 35:35.925
Fine.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.553
But we leave at first light, okay?

35:40.763 --> 35:41.931
Thanks.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.601
Ta-da!

36:29.353 --> 36:32.106
Really, Penny

36:32.190 --> 36:35.109
Okay, I admit it's not exactly
worthy of Lascaux.

36:37.111 --> 36:39.322
The ancient cave paintings
from prehistoric times?

36:39.405 --> 36:40.907
-Paleolithic.
-Upper Paleolithic.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.491
You're missing the point.

36:46.871 --> 36:52.376
This is the same red ocher, here,
a billion, billion miles away.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.294
It's vandalism.

36:53.377 --> 36:56.839
No, it's not. No one knows what
those ancient cave paintings were for.

36:56.923 --> 36:59.759
Why did early humans start to draw?

37:01.469 --> 37:02.970
I think I figured it out.

37:05.598 --> 37:08.559
You paint a picture so you can sign it.

37:11.979 --> 37:15.858
We might be tiny infinitesimal blips
in the universe,

37:16.692 --> 37:18.110
but we made it here.

37:23.950 --> 37:27.453
Come on, it says "The Robinsons."

37:28.162 --> 37:29.914
-Come on.
You know you wanna.

37:29.997 --> 37:32.416
Okay. Okay.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.166
Don't worry about the dish.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.044
You'll come up with another way
to reach the<i> Resolute.</i>

38:17.128 --> 38:19.922
What if that was it,
that was my last plan?

38:20.006 --> 38:23.634
And now there's just... no more plans?

38:31.559 --> 38:32.977
Never gonna happen.

39:06.302 --> 39:07.678
What is that?

39:08.179 --> 39:09.096
Wow.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.585
Guys...

39:40.544 --> 39:42.129
Guys, you gotta come see this.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.762
I know I didn't tell you I was leaving.

40:32.596 --> 40:34.515
Because I, um... I don't know.

40:34.598 --> 40:37.017
I honestly thought
that you'd be happy about it.

40:38.602 --> 40:41.272
Yeah, 'cause you're, like,
super annoying most of the time.

40:42.815 --> 40:43.816
Yeah, I know.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.862
Hey, at least you still got Will
to boss around.

40:47.945 --> 40:50.489
It's really not as rewarding
as you'd think.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.995
A lot of stars out there.
Hmm.

40:58.372 --> 40:59.415
Hmm.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.085
I wonder which one is ours.

41:05.796 --> 41:08.340
The one we came from,
or the one we're going to?

41:10.217 --> 41:12.219
At this point, I'm not that picky.

41:13.637 --> 41:14.472
Yeah.

41:18.893 --> 41:21.520
It's not like it's the first time
we've been lost.

41:21.604 --> 41:22.771
That was not my fault.

41:22.855 --> 41:25.399
That was absolutely your fault.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.486
Every hill just led to a bigger,
steeper hill.

41:28.569 --> 41:31.155
Every hill in Tuscany
is a magnificent thing of beauty.

41:31.238 --> 41:33.491
We had to sleep outside that church.

41:33.574 --> 41:34.992
It was your idea to go hiking.

41:35.075 --> 41:37.077
You're the one
who left the compass at the hotel.

41:37.161 --> 41:40.456
Well, it was our honeymoon
and I was trying to impress you

41:40.539 --> 41:43.375
-with my orienteering skills.

41:45.377 --> 41:47.880
Well, you impressed me in other ways.

41:59.725 --> 42:00.809
So...

42:02.269 --> 42:03.395
So when we finally get there,

42:03.479 --> 42:05.606
do you have any idea
where you plan on living?

42:07.066 --> 42:08.192
What?

42:08.275 --> 42:09.818
On Alpha Centauri.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.827
I mean, I...

42:20.746 --> 42:24.875
I guess I want to be as close to you
and the kids as possible, so--

42:24.959 --> 42:27.044
Sure, but for how long?

42:29.755 --> 42:32.174
-Forget it.

42:32.258 --> 42:36.178
No, listen. Believe me,
it's better if we don't even get into it.

42:37.137 --> 42:40.516
Maureen, please don't shut me down
like that. Talk to me.

42:42.434 --> 42:44.270
I found the letter, John.

42:45.479 --> 42:46.605
What letter?

42:48.857 --> 42:51.110
Maureen, hey, wait!

42:56.782 --> 42:57.700
Earthquake.

43:00.536 --> 43:01.412
No, John! No!

43:02.580 --> 43:03.581
Get down!

43:07.167 --> 43:08.836
Hey, you okay?

43:08.919 --> 43:10.462
Yeah, you?

43:10.546 --> 43:12.006
Yeah.

43:17.553 --> 43:18.596
Here.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.848
We could have made it.

43:20.931 --> 43:22.516
No, John, we couldn't have.

43:25.477 --> 43:28.063
Have you got a signal?
No.

43:28.731 --> 43:30.149
Hey!

43:31.900 --> 43:34.945
Hey, Don! Little help in here, please.

43:54.256 --> 43:55.674
He'll figure it out eventually.

43:56.342 --> 43:57.343
Yeah?

43:58.802 --> 44:00.596
What are we gonna do until then?

44:10.481 --> 44:11.982
For the record, I wasn't snooping.

44:13.692 --> 44:17.404
The letter, when it came, I...
I opened it by accident.

44:19.657 --> 44:22.701
Who even uses regular mail nowadays,
anyway?

44:23.285 --> 44:25.871
It had that little blue logo
in the corner of the envelope,

44:25.954 --> 44:28.707
the one that comes on all the invites
for the military social functions,

44:28.791 --> 44:30.417
and I guess I just...

44:31.377 --> 44:34.713
I think I was just excited
to get dressed up.

44:35.839 --> 44:38.884
It had been so long
since we'd been dancing.

44:42.930 --> 44:44.431
And then I read it and I...

44:46.016 --> 44:47.851
I remember so well where I was

44:47.935 --> 44:49.978
because I was supposed to
be picking up Judy from soccer

44:50.062 --> 44:54.191
and I just sat in the car
in the parking lot... crying.

44:55.275 --> 44:58.529
And not because you lied to me,

45:00.030 --> 45:02.616
but because I was gonna have to lie
to the kids.

45:03.617 --> 45:05.869
And I couldn't tell them the truth.

45:05.953 --> 45:09.164
That their father wasn't ordered back
to his combat post.

45:09.248 --> 45:13.001
That he didn't actually have to go,
but that he chose to go.

45:13.085 --> 45:16.964
Chose to go 6,000 miles away.

45:22.219 --> 45:26.223
You know, the world we left behind
was a big place.

45:26.306 --> 45:32.229
And not all of us had the luxury
of only feeling responsible

45:32.312 --> 45:33.897
for our small little part of it.

45:34.481 --> 45:37.401
-That is so not fair.
-Hey, you could've asked me to stay.

45:42.489 --> 45:43.615
You didn't.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.870
So, while we're being honest,

45:47.953 --> 45:51.457
let's not pretend that my leaving
wasn't for the best.

45:57.337 --> 45:58.881
So is that what we're doing now?

46:01.967 --> 46:03.177
Pretending?

46:06.388 --> 46:08.557
You guys in there?

46:09.641 --> 46:10.517
Hey.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.729
Finally. I've been
looking all over for you. You okay?

46:13.812 --> 46:15.772
Yeah. Just wish we weren't in here.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.358
Well, hold tight. I gotcha.

46:18.484 --> 46:20.986
Just so you know,
it's gonna take some time to get you out.

46:21.820 --> 46:23.572
Great.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.212
Whoo!

48:02.296 --> 48:05.215
Good morning! Hope you guys slept well.

48:05.299 --> 48:07.426
I myself spent the whole night
looking through crates

48:07.509 --> 48:10.345
for some shaped charges
to blow this beautiful hole

48:10.429 --> 48:13.890
and save your lives.
Now, do I want any kind of compensation?

48:13.974 --> 48:15.309
Let's go!

48:15.767 --> 48:17.728
Yeah. Just...

48:20.772 --> 48:25.444
For my collection?
Thanks. That's a good one.

48:25.527 --> 48:28.614
Come on, we've gotta get home
before Mom and Dad do.

48:31.366 --> 48:33.118
We'll come back for you.

48:40.292 --> 48:43.754
I have to go. And you have to stay here.

48:43.837 --> 48:46.089
Danger, Will Robinson.

48:46.173 --> 48:49.134
No, you're the one in danger.

48:50.385 --> 48:53.972
And I know you want to come,
but you can't.

48:54.723 --> 48:57.684
You have to stay here. Okay?

49:04.608 --> 49:05.442
No.

49:08.987 --> 49:10.155
Stay here.

49:58.662 --> 50:02.499
Jupiter 4
<i>to Chariot 11. Come in, Chariot 11.</i>

50:04.376 --> 50:05.752
This is C-11.

50:06.336 --> 50:09.506
Naoko, have you heard from the Robinsons?
No one's responding at their Jupiter.

50:13.927 --> 50:16.138
Hello, Victor. This is Maureen Robinson.

50:17.013 --> 50:19.891
<i>We borrowed the Watanabes' Chariot.</i>

50:20.642 --> 50:23.019
Maureen, I was glad to hear you survived.

50:23.103 --> 50:25.939
<i>Next time you want to go off</i>
<i>visiting friends, clear it with me first.</i>

50:26.023 --> 50:29.067
<i>-For your own safety.</i>
-I voted for the other guy.

50:29.151 --> 50:31.528
Well, I didn't get a vote.
-<i>I've been trying to reach you</i>

50:31.611 --> 50:34.573
because no one's able to establish contact
with the<i> Resolute.</i>

50:34.656 --> 50:36.575
We're gonna need to amplify the signal.

50:36.658 --> 50:39.035
About that, that's not gonna work.

50:39.119 --> 50:43.582
We found the<i> Resolute's </i>satellite dish.
It's down here.

50:44.291 --> 50:45.208
Here?

50:45.751 --> 50:48.920
Yeah. That changes things, doesn't it?

50:52.048 --> 50:53.175
Yes, it does.

50:54.801 --> 50:55.844
We're gonna need a plan B.

50:56.511 --> 50:59.389
<i>I'll be at your Jupiter in an hour</i>
<i>with some other survivors.</i>

50:59.473 --> 51:01.183
<i>Be ready to get your hands dirty.</i>

51:28.794 --> 51:31.755
You know, I can take this back
to the Watanabes by myself.

51:31.838 --> 51:34.674
-No, we're fine. Thanks.
-No big deal.

51:34.758 --> 51:35.967
Yeah.

51:36.051 --> 51:37.302
Hey, thanks.

51:38.887 --> 51:40.555
-See you later.
-See you.

52:01.117 --> 52:02.661
Hello?

52:05.372 --> 52:06.331
Anyone here?

52:06.414 --> 52:07.874
We're back.

52:09.835 --> 52:11.628
Penny!

52:12.379 --> 52:13.463
Will!

52:21.638 --> 52:22.848
Judy?

52:26.059 --> 52:26.893
Dr. Smith?

52:31.273 --> 52:32.274
Weird.

52:33.567 --> 52:35.277
Hi!
-Oh, hey, buddy.

52:36.778 --> 52:39.656
Will. Will.

52:42.284 --> 52:43.577
-Oh.

52:43.660 --> 52:45.036
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.

52:47.789 --> 52:51.376
Oh. Hello.
I didn't expect you back so soon.

52:52.586 --> 52:53.587
Hi, honey.

52:53.670 --> 52:54.504
Hi, Mama.

52:56.464 --> 52:59.301
Hey, Mom.

52:59.384 --> 53:01.219
-It was boring.
-Yeah, it was really boring.

53:03.054 --> 53:04.514
Where's the robot?

53:07.392 --> 53:08.226
Hmm?

53:10.562 --> 53:11.771
What's going on?

53:13.565 --> 53:16.568
I... I don't know.
I think he wandered off.

53:17.110 --> 53:18.778
Wandered off?
-Yeah.

53:19.613 --> 53:23.783
We considered going after him.
It just seemed pretty irresponsible.

53:25.410 --> 53:29.748
Okay. I guess, uh,
someone has to go find it.

53:29.831 --> 53:31.875
I hope it hasn't gone far.

53:43.094 --> 53:44.930
-You said "he."

53:46.890 --> 53:47.724
The robot.

53:50.352 --> 53:53.355
-You called him "he."
-It's just a pronoun.

53:55.690 --> 53:58.193
Hey, you are gonna tell Dad
the truth tomorrow, right?

54:01.696 --> 54:02.530
Will?

54:03.448 --> 54:05.575
Yeah. Sure.

54:06.409 --> 54:07.369
Okay.

54:07.953 --> 54:09.621
You guys think he'll be okay out there?

54:10.413 --> 54:11.456
The robot?

54:12.207 --> 54:14.125
Yeah. You picked a good spot.

54:14.209 --> 54:18.463
We're the only ones who know where he is.
He'll be fine.

54:31.643 --> 54:32.602
Alone.

54:34.646 --> 54:35.480
At last.

54:40.402 --> 54:43.113
I was thinking you and I
could get to know one another.

54:49.536 --> 54:51.830
After all, we have so much in common.

54:53.373 --> 54:55.959
We were both someone else
up on the<i> Resolute.</i>

54:57.293 --> 55:00.588
Someone to keep secret
from the folks down here.

55:07.429 --> 55:10.932
The way I see it, I think
you and I could help one another.

55:14.227 --> 55:15.979
The question is...

55:17.605 --> 55:18.565
how?

55:22.777 --> 55:25.739
Will said when he found you,
you were in pieces.

55:27.157 --> 55:28.408
Wounded. Dying.

55:34.497 --> 55:38.960
If only I'd gotten there sooner,
it could have been me.

55:39.544 --> 55:41.546
Which would have made all this
a whole lot easier.

55:47.927 --> 55:49.345
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

55:51.473 --> 55:54.017
Just like I know you would never hurt me.

55:55.518 --> 55:59.981
Will made sure of that.
Told you never to hurt anyone.

56:01.066 --> 56:02.442
Ever.

56:06.029 --> 56:07.614
Turns out that's a bit of a problem.

56:08.156 --> 56:11.284
See, I can't go back to the<i> Resolute</i>
without some protection.

56:12.035 --> 56:14.454
The kind that only you can provide.

56:14.537 --> 56:15.622
But...

56:18.416 --> 56:19.876
if we're gonna work together,

56:20.668 --> 56:22.754
I need you to have all your options
on the table. You want to belong.

56:40.730 --> 56:45.527
Which is why you think
you're doing the right thing

56:47.237 --> 56:49.948
by following whatever
that boy tells you to do.

56:51.825 --> 56:53.868
But the thing you'll learn
about people is...

56:57.163 --> 56:58.289
they're unreliable.

57:00.291 --> 57:02.710
They're not loyal like you are.

57:02.794 --> 57:04.379
They'll turn on you.  Will Robinson.

57:06.131 --> 57:08.675
Yes. Even Will Robinson.

57:11.886 --> 57:12.971
And when he does...

57:16.975 --> 57:18.893
who will be there to save you?

57:23.857 --> 57:24.941
Me.
