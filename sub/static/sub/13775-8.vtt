RUXIN: ♪ Ruxin's on my bed

00:03.600 --> 00:04.767
And he's mackin' some cheese.

00:04.835 --> 00:06.502
Checkin' out some legal briefs.

00:06.570 --> 00:08.905
And watchin' TV. ♪

00:08.973 --> 00:10.706
I got to do an album.

00:10.774 --> 00:11.707
(mumbles)

00:11.775 --> 00:14.210
(over TV): They don't want to
fall behind on the road in this

00:14.278 --> 00:16.046
hostile environment with this
noisy crowd, and to play with

00:16.113 --> 00:17.948
the league, they want to be balanced.

00:18.015 --> 00:19.682
They've been excellent at
running the football and

00:19.750 --> 00:21.384
throwing it... almost 200
yards in each category.

00:22.878 --> 00:23.650
Hi.

00:23.770 --> 00:24.343
Hi.

00:24.463 --> 00:28.358
I was just using this
fork to comb my hair?

00:28.426 --> 00:30.492
You look beautiful.

00:30.612 --> 00:33.014
You want to maybe get a little exercise?

00:33.081 --> 00:34.181
Little exercise?

00:34.249 --> 00:35.616
Little cardio?

00:35.684 --> 00:41.556
Hmm, yeah, I could do some cardio.

00:41.623 --> 00:43.858
(Ruxin chuckles)

00:51.013 --> 00:52.252
I freaked out.

00:52.372 --> 00:54.735
My wife has completely changed
her pubic configuration.

00:54.803 --> 00:57.838
She went from the pizza slice
straight up to a breadstick.

00:57.906 --> 01:00.307
She's relandscaping the whole
front yard for resale.

01:00.375 --> 01:01.542
She is going to leave me.

01:01.610 --> 01:02.376
I-I can feel it.

01:02.444 --> 01:04.211
KEVIN: I don't know what the issue is.

01:04.279 --> 01:05.245
She's not complaining.

01:05.313 --> 01:06.246
What's the big deal?

01:06.314 --> 01:08.716
75% of the words that come
out of my wife's mouth are

01:08.784 --> 01:13.688
complaints, and now all is quiet
on the Ruxin front... too quiet.

01:13.755 --> 01:16.757
She is souring on this marriage,
and can you blame her?

01:16.825 --> 01:20.061
She looks like she belongs on a
beer poster, and I look like the

01:20.128 --> 01:22.663
guy who makes you answer riddles
before you cross a bridge.

01:22.731 --> 01:25.766
ANDRE: Could it just be that
she loves you for your quirks

01:25.834 --> 01:28.869
and that maybe... just
maybe... she's happy?

01:28.937 --> 01:31.072
No, my wife is too smart to be happy.

01:31.139 --> 01:35.743
I think it's more possible
that she's happy than smart.

01:35.811 --> 01:37.011
Oh, you guys want proof?

01:37.079 --> 01:39.246
She has switched from yoga to Pilates.

01:39.314 --> 01:40.247
Oh.

01:40.315 --> 01:41.248
Ooh.

01:41.316 --> 01:44.619
So she wants to be healthier and
more attractive, and that's bad?

01:44.686 --> 01:50.091
Andre, yoga is communist cardio, and
Pilates is free-market capitalism.

01:50.158 --> 01:53.360
She is deregulating that body so
that corporations can come in

01:53.428 --> 01:55.596
and just go to town on that puss.

01:55.664 --> 01:58.899
Everybody knows that the sole
purpose for Pilates is to get

01:58.967 --> 02:01.135
the muscles ready just to
be pounded on by dudes.

02:01.202 --> 02:02.036
Uh, hello, I took Pilates.

02:02.104 --> 02:02.870
Exactly, case in point.

02:02.938 --> 02:03.871
What?

02:03.939 --> 02:05.806
I've never been pounded on by dudes.

02:05.874 --> 02:06.641
TACO: Define "never."

02:06.708 --> 02:07.474
You know what?

02:07.542 --> 02:10.544
If I did make that choice, I would hope
that you would support me... all of you.

02:10.612 --> 02:12.412
Of course we would support you.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.783
We would support your head while
dudes just dumped loads into the

02:15.851 --> 02:17.551
back of your throat... gah!

02:17.619 --> 02:18.552
Place is pretty awesome.

02:18.620 --> 02:19.620
I think you're going to like it.

02:19.688 --> 02:20.454
JENNY: Cool.

02:20.522 --> 02:21.756
Who's Dr. Robert Melvoy?

02:21.823 --> 02:23.891
Oh, he's some psychologist
who used to live here.

02:23.959 --> 02:24.825
Check it out.

02:24.893 --> 02:26.794
Taco, this is really nice.

02:26.862 --> 02:27.928
How'd you find this place?

02:27.996 --> 02:32.133
Oh, I was reading the obituaries, and I
found out that Dr. Melvoy died in here.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.134
He died in here?

02:33.201 --> 02:35.069
Yeah, they didn't find his
body for about a week.

02:35.137 --> 02:36.137
It brought the price down.

02:36.204 --> 02:37.138
Where did he die?

02:37.205 --> 02:41.976
Uh, judging from the death stain,
probably exactly where you're sitting.

02:42.044 --> 02:44.011
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

02:44.079 --> 02:45.179
I love this place.

02:45.246 --> 02:46.180
It is awesome.

02:46.247 --> 02:48.348
It's right down the street from
the dog-grooming van where I get

02:48.416 --> 02:51.185
my hair cut, and I don't need
Wi-Fi because my neighbors have

02:51.252 --> 02:53.420
sex all the time and I can see them.

02:53.488 --> 02:55.455
It's getting a little redundant, though.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.624
Unless they introduce a toy or a
third person, I'll probably have

02:57.693 --> 02:59.860
to steal someone's cable.

02:59.928 --> 03:01.929
So, Ruxin, I heard through the
message board that one of

03:01.997 --> 03:04.331
your quarterbacks might soon
be on the trading block.

03:04.399 --> 03:07.802
I got an embarrassment of
riches... RGIII and Stafford...

03:07.869 --> 03:10.337
but my defenses are looking
weaker than a drunk, single girl

03:10.405 --> 03:12.272
in her 30s at her little
sister's wedding.

03:12.340 --> 03:14.108
I want one of those quarterbacks.

03:14.176 --> 03:15.209
PETE: Oh, shit, Lane's here.

03:15.276 --> 03:18.378
If he comes over, he's just going
to latch on to me the entire night.

03:18.446 --> 03:21.087
He is an intolerable douchebag.

03:21.096 --> 03:23.497
Yeah, how did he latch on to you?

03:23.565 --> 03:25.733
I'm at this party with a friend
of mine, Lane walks up to

03:25.801 --> 03:29.037
us, starts just dropping douche
bombs all over the place, like,

03:29.104 --> 03:31.906
"Did you know that surf music
is the American flamenco?"

03:31.974 --> 03:32.907
Ugh.

03:32.975 --> 03:34.742
It's horrible, and my friend's
like, "Hey, let me buy"

03:34.810 --> 03:36.577
"you guys some drinks," all happy.

03:36.645 --> 03:39.180
He bolts and ditches me with Lane.

03:39.248 --> 03:40.448
Ah, you got friend-offed.

03:40.515 --> 03:42.283
Exactly, a friend-off's like a handoff.

03:42.351 --> 03:45.019
You got to put that foot down,
you got to make that turn and

03:45.087 --> 03:47.388
cut, and you got to go for
daylight before you get covered

03:47.456 --> 03:50.591
in a sweaty pile of undesirable dude.

03:50.659 --> 03:51.725
Oh, come on, don't even.

03:51.793 --> 03:52.726
Pete.

03:52.794 --> 03:53.727
Huh... Lane.

03:53.795 --> 03:54.795
I thought it was you.

03:54.863 --> 03:55.629
Unbelievable... come here.

03:55.697 --> 03:56.630
Unbelievable.

03:56.698 --> 03:58.566
I have been trying to
get in touch with you.

03:58.633 --> 04:00.468
I've called you and e-mailed you.

04:00.535 --> 04:02.270
You probably thought I was
still in South America.

04:02.338 --> 04:03.438
I was hoping so.

04:03.505 --> 04:06.740
When I say "merengue," what are the first
three words that come into your head?

04:06.808 --> 04:08.042
Must leave now?

04:08.110 --> 04:10.244
I understand why you'd say
that; conditions are grim.

04:10.312 --> 04:13.247
There were days when I couldn't even
find clean water for my neti pot.

04:13.315 --> 04:14.248
Wow.

04:14.316 --> 04:15.916
Yeah, it was better than Haiti, though.

04:15.985 --> 04:18.819
I went down to Haiti after the
earthquake to deejay for the villagers.

04:18.887 --> 04:21.422
I mean, gratis, no charge.

04:21.490 --> 04:22.423
Hey, where is everybody?

04:22.491 --> 04:24.325
Andre, oh, my God, it is
so amazing to see you.

04:24.393 --> 04:25.159
Really? All right.

04:25.227 --> 04:26.995
Come here, I haven't seen you in forever.

04:27.062 --> 04:27.828
What's going on?

04:27.896 --> 04:29.763
I want to introduce you to Lane.

04:29.831 --> 04:30.598
Lane, this is Andre.

04:30.665 --> 04:31.432
Hey, all right.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.134
Andre, we were just talking
about deejaying in Haiti.

04:33.202 --> 04:35.336
Oh, my God, I so want to do that.

04:35.404 --> 04:38.339
I feel like that's the best way to
give back to everyone down there.

04:38.407 --> 04:40.274
This is gonna be a great night.

04:40.342 --> 04:42.143
I'm gonna go to the restroom
real quick and I'll be right

04:42.211 --> 04:43.077
back, and you guys chill out.

04:43.145 --> 04:44.078
Okay.

04:44.146 --> 04:46.981
Wow, so you... How do you
get into that DJ scene?

04:47.049 --> 04:49.150
'Cause that's something that I
have been dying to do, but I

04:49.218 --> 04:51.252
feel like a lot of it is politics.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.353
So what's your DJ name?

04:52.421 --> 04:53.287
Little Miss Spin.

04:53.355 --> 04:56.157
Haven't men taken enough from women
already without taking "miss"?

04:56.225 --> 04:58.292
Oh, n-no, no, no, no, it's, it's ironic.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.627
How so?

04:59.694 --> 05:01.595
I, I don't, I don't know.

05:01.663 --> 05:02.921
Always know how you're being ironic.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.617
That's a good rule.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.425
Text that to myself.

05:14.213 --> 05:15.987
Look at this.

05:16.235 --> 05:18.383
All right.

05:18.451 --> 05:19.384
Hmm.

05:20.536 --> 05:23.504
<i>Listening with Compassion.</i>

05:23.572 --> 05:26.174
<i>Hey, dead guy, where are
you hiding your weed?</i>

05:26.242 --> 05:27.175
<i>(knocking)</i>

05:27.243 --> 05:29.978
<i>Come in.</i>

05:30.046 --> 05:32.547
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, I was, uh,
looking for Dr. Melvoy.</i>

05:32.615 --> 05:34.049
<i>He's no longer here.</i>

05:34.117 --> 05:35.050
<i>I'm here now.</i>

05:35.118 --> 05:37.219
<i>Oh, he didn't tell me
anything about that.</i>

05:37.286 --> 05:39.254
<i>He probably told you, I'm
dealing with a lot of</i>

05:39.321 --> 05:40.155
<i>abandonment issues.</i>

05:40.223 --> 05:42.057
<i>And how does that make you feel?</i>

05:42.125 --> 05:45.260
<i>I've tried some different
diets, and, um... Didn't work.</i>

05:45.327 --> 05:46.261
<i>No.</i>

05:46.328 --> 05:48.529
<i>Here's a course of action
I'd like to propose.</i>

05:48.597 --> 05:51.233
<i>For every pound that you lose,
I will have sexual intercourse</i>

05:51.300 --> 05:52.067
<i>with you one time.</i>

05:52.135 --> 05:53.068
<i>Really?</i>

05:53.136 --> 05:55.003
<i>Mm-hmm, and I'll throw in a
freebie right now just to let</i>

05:55.071 --> 05:56.938
<i>you know what you're going to get.</i>

05:57.006 --> 05:58.206
<i>I can't quit, I can't quit.</i>

05:58.274 --> 06:00.375
<i>Let me tell you what you're going to do.</i>

06:00.442 --> 06:02.911
<i>Every time you feel like taking
drugs or taking a drink, you're</i>

06:02.979 --> 06:05.247
<i>going to bring it here and
we're going to share it.</i>

06:05.314 --> 06:08.116
<i>Slowly I'll take more and more,
tapering you off until finally.</i>

06:08.184 --> 06:10.252
<i>I'm doing all your drugs
and alcohol for you.</i>

06:10.319 --> 06:12.254
<i>Now, don't be stingy with that weed.</i>

06:12.321 --> 06:14.455
<i>Yeah, come to Papa.</i>

06:14.523 --> 06:16.258
<i>Oh, this is some good shit.</i>

06:16.325 --> 06:17.259
<i>I hate school.</i>

06:17.326 --> 06:18.359
<i>I get bullied every day.</i>

06:18.427 --> 06:19.694
<i>I wish I didn't have to go.</i>

06:19.762 --> 06:21.897
<i>You're going to go to school,
but this is what you're going to</i>

06:21.964 --> 06:23.731
<i>do: you're going to bring
this gun with you.</i>

06:23.800 --> 06:24.565
<i>Check it out.</i>

06:24.633 --> 06:25.400
<i>(gun clicks)</i>

06:25.467 --> 06:27.302
<i>Chamber's empty, but
they don't know that.</i>

06:27.369 --> 06:31.072
<i>What you do is, you put it
in your waistband like this.</i>

06:31.140 --> 06:34.375
<i>When they come at you, just lift
your T-shirt... not too high,</i>

06:34.443 --> 06:36.377
<i>though, or else they're going to
see those bitch tits of yours.</i>

06:36.445 --> 06:37.212
<i>You hear me?</i>

06:37.280 --> 06:39.114
<i>Where'd you go the other night?</i>

06:39.182 --> 06:42.050
<i>Sorry, I didn't mean to ditch
you, but I just could not bear</i>

06:42.118 --> 06:43.285
<i>to be around Lane any longer.</i>

06:43.352 --> 06:44.252
<i>I had to do it.</i>

06:44.320 --> 06:46.554
<i>You must have wanted to gnaw
your arm off to get away from</i>

06:46.622 --> 06:47.388
<i>that guy.</i>

06:47.456 --> 06:49.825
<i>No, he, like, left a couple
seconds after you disappeared.</i>

06:49.892 --> 06:50.658
<i>What do you mean?</i>

06:50.726 --> 06:52.928
<i>He didn't talk your ear off
about how rockabilly is the</i>

06:52.995 --> 06:54.162
<i>klezmer music of the red states?</i>

06:54.230 --> 06:56.397
<i>No, he just kind of took
off right after you.</i>

06:56.465 --> 06:58.733
<i>Ah, he usually gloms on to any
conversation he can get his</i>

06:58.801 --> 06:59.567
<i>mitts on.</i>

06:59.635 --> 07:00.501
<i>No, no glomming.</i>

07:00.569 --> 07:03.004
<i>Oh, shit, I fumbled the friend-off.</i>

07:03.072 --> 07:04.005
<i>What's a friend-off?</i>

07:04.073 --> 07:05.006
<i>I'm stuck with him now.</i>

07:05.074 --> 07:06.007
<i>Hey, Taco.</i>

07:06.075 --> 07:07.008
<i>Whoa. Whoa, whoa!</i>

07:07.076 --> 07:09.777
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, no, no,
no, no, no, absolutely not.</i>

07:09.846 --> 07:12.513
<i>We're brothers... it's weird
if I don't</i> sit on your lap.

07:12.581 --> 07:13.648
Get yourself a chair.

07:13.716 --> 07:15.750
Hey, Taco, how's the therapy practice?

07:15.818 --> 07:16.952
It is going awesome.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.954
Helping people with their stupid
brain problems is super easy.

07:19.021 --> 07:19.955
I'm impressed.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.789
Why are you guys impressed with <i>him?</i>

07:21.858 --> 07:22.623
<i>I went to med school.</i>

07:22.691 --> 07:23.758
<i>I'm a doctor.</i>

07:23.826 --> 07:25.426
<i>He didn't even finish high school.</i>

07:25.494 --> 07:27.095
<i>Well, that's precisely
why we're impressed.</i>

07:27.163 --> 07:27.863
<i>He's over-performing.</i>

07:27.930 --> 07:29.630
<i>He's like the fat kid in Rudy.</i>

07:29.698 --> 07:31.632
<i>Mm-mm. Turns out he wasn't just
a fat kid; he was a hobbit.</i>

07:31.700 --> 07:33.634
<i>That's why he was so good at football.</i>

07:33.702 --> 07:35.636
<i>You don't even know what you're doing.</i>

07:35.704 --> 07:37.839
<i>Mmm. It makes you anxious
when things don't fit in your</i>

07:37.907 --> 07:39.807
<i>neat little boxes, doesn't it, Andre?</i>

07:39.876 --> 07:40.475
<i>Stop.</i>

07:40.542 --> 07:41.476
<i>Let's explore that.</i>

07:41.543 --> 07:43.478
<i>No, we're not exploring anything.</i>

07:43.545 --> 07:45.480
<i>Are you smoking weed out of that pipe?</i>

07:45.547 --> 07:47.883
<i>No. I'm smoking weed out
of the bong I built inside</i>

07:47.950 --> 07:49.117
<i>of the pipe.</i>

07:49.185 --> 07:51.486
<i>That's right: I turned this into
a marijuana-smoking device.</i>

07:51.553 --> 07:53.889
<i>That's the kind of mind
you're dealing with here.</i>

07:53.956 --> 07:55.991
<i>All right, I figured it out.</i>

07:56.058 --> 07:56.992
<i>Anchor baby.</i>

07:57.059 --> 07:57.993
<i>What?</i>

07:58.060 --> 08:00.661
<i>I need to convince Sofia to
have another child with me.</i>

08:00.729 --> 08:03.498
<i>'Cause then she's pregnant for a
year, she's out of commission.</i>

08:03.565 --> 08:07.168
<i>Then she's feeling maternal and
unattractive for another year...</i>

08:07.236 --> 08:08.503
<i>out of commission.</i>

08:08.570 --> 08:11.039
<i>If she looks at the cost-benefit
analysis of leaving me, it's too</i>

08:11.107 --> 08:12.473
<i>risky of a move.</i>

08:12.541 --> 08:14.509
<i>That is a beautiful plan
you have worked out.</i>

08:14.576 --> 08:16.544
<i>Yeah, I think if I put
another baby in her, it'll</i>

08:16.612 --> 08:19.347
<i>really crush her spirit... kind
of like Kevin did to Jenny.</i>

08:19.415 --> 08:21.416
<i>I did not crush Jenny's spirit.</i>

08:21.483 --> 08:23.584
<i>Kevin, you are a soul-crushing ninja.</i>

08:23.652 --> 08:26.654
<i>I mean, you've convinced all of
us to hang out with you, and</i>

08:26.722 --> 08:28.924
<i>we're not even the depository
for your rancid seed.</i>

08:28.991 --> 08:29.925
<i>Okay.</i>

08:29.992 --> 08:32.360
<i>Well, most of us.</i>

08:32.428 --> 08:34.095
<i>You two are clearly in love.</i>

08:34.163 --> 08:36.664
<i>Let's talk about this.</i>

08:36.732 --> 08:38.166
<i>Ruxin, let's talk trade.</i>

08:38.234 --> 08:39.234
<i>I don't have a lot of time.</i>

08:39.302 --> 08:41.236
<i>I'm putting baby Christopher to sleep.</i>

08:41.304 --> 08:43.604
<i>Where do</i> you put Chalupa
Batman to bed, in the pantry or

08:43.672 --> 08:44.839
the freezer section?

08:44.907 --> 08:45.840
You know, it's not funny.

08:45.908 --> 08:49.577
Listen, you have RGIII, and I could
really use a great quarterback.

08:49.645 --> 08:51.579
I'm not even thinking
about football right now.

08:51.647 --> 08:54.015
I want to ask Sofia about the
anchor baby, but I really only

08:54.083 --> 08:58.186
get one shot 'cause if she
says no, I'm totally screwed.

08:58.254 --> 09:01.756
So I feel like I'm constantly, you
know, beating around the shaved bush.

09:01.824 --> 09:03.458
(Ruxin continues indistinctly)

09:03.525 --> 09:05.393
Okay, Ruxin, focus here.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.761
Here's my offer.

09:06.829 --> 09:09.097
The San Francisco 49ers defense.

09:09.165 --> 09:10.698
That is a top-tier, ♪1

09:10.766 --> 09:12.033
starting defense.

09:12.101 --> 09:14.469
I'm willing to part with it for RGIII.

09:14.536 --> 09:15.470
What?

09:15.537 --> 09:16.637
Okay, all right, fine.

09:16.705 --> 09:20.475
I'll give you the San Francisco
defense <i>and... No, no, no.</i>

09:20.542 --> 09:22.877
<i>That's not how this is going to go down.</i>

09:22.945 --> 09:23.878
<i>...Giants offense.</i>

09:23.946 --> 09:24.879
<i>That's big, Ruxin.</i>

09:24.947 --> 09:25.880
<i>That's not bad.</i>

09:25.948 --> 09:27.082
<i>Yeah, I could do that deal.</i>

09:27.149 --> 09:28.483
<i>Really? Great, okay.</i>

09:28.550 --> 09:29.985
<i>Do not trade RGIII.</i>

09:30.052 --> 09:32.387
<i>This is the kind of thing
where everybody wins.</i>

09:32.455 --> 09:34.755
<i>So, just go to the computer and
type it up, send it over to me</i>

09:34.823 --> 09:36.757
<i>and I'll approve it, and you
should have our players by the</i>

09:36.825 --> 09:37.758
<i>weekend.</i>

09:37.826 --> 09:40.761
<i>You know what, I don't think I
can do the deal anymore, buddy.</i>

09:40.829 --> 09:42.964
<i>What? You don't want to do the trade?
We just had...</i>

09:43.032 --> 09:46.334
<i>Yes, I am. I am stone-cold!</i>

09:46.402 --> 09:47.835
<i>Yeah, no deal. Sorry, dude.</i>

09:47.903 --> 09:50.238
<i>Sucks to be you. Peace.</i>

09:50.306 --> 09:52.240
<i>Are you kidding me, Ruxin?</i>

09:52.308 --> 09:55.110
<i>Hello? What happened?</i>

09:55.177 --> 09:56.978
<i>How are my sweet boys doing?</i>

09:57.046 --> 09:58.113
<i>(Kevin groans)</i>

09:58.180 --> 09:59.114
<i>You okay?</i>

09:59.181 --> 10:00.115
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:00.182 --> 10:01.282
<i>Is his onesie on backwards?</i>

10:01.350 --> 10:03.418
<i>I don't know, I don't
know if it's on backwards.</i>

10:03.486 --> 10:06.521
<i>He's gonna piss through
it in an hour anyway.</i>

10:06.588 --> 10:08.789
<i>(quietly): Okay.</i>

10:08.857 --> 10:12.660
<i>Christopher, can you say "RGIII"?</i>

10:20.616 --> 10:22.551
It's like Terrific Lady Day again.

10:22.618 --> 10:26.287
Yeah. No better way to spend a
Sunday than just looking at flowers.

10:26.355 --> 10:27.288
Look at this.

10:27.356 --> 10:28.890
This is so amazing!

10:28.958 --> 10:30.892
Oh, my God, it's so vibrant!

10:30.960 --> 10:32.594
I could stare at this all day.

10:32.662 --> 10:35.396
Yeah, and I could stand next
to you while you do it.

10:35.465 --> 10:38.232
Some guys get squeamish about
flower shopping with another

10:38.300 --> 10:41.202
dude, but don't worry, I'm
confidently heterosexual.

10:41.270 --> 10:44.272
I got all the gay stuff out of my
system during my Semester at Sea.

10:44.340 --> 10:45.273
Great. Thank you, Lane.

10:45.341 --> 10:46.274
Tiger orchid!

10:46.342 --> 10:50.378
Yeah, I-I'll be right there.

10:50.446 --> 10:51.646
(mouthing)

10:51.714 --> 10:53.982
Hey, babe, I'm gonna look
at the other orchids.

10:54.049 --> 10:57.652
Okay.

10:57.720 --> 10:58.753
What are you doing here?

10:58.821 --> 11:01.990
I'm trying to ditch Lane and bore
him, but the guy's un-boreable.

11:02.057 --> 11:03.992
Well, I'm on a Terrific
Lady nightmare with Sofia.

11:04.059 --> 11:05.994
I envy those day-laborers over there.

11:06.061 --> 11:08.162
Yeah, they have to huff
pesticides and shovel manure

11:08.230 --> 11:10.799
all day, but at least on Sunday
they get to watch football.

11:10.867 --> 11:11.800
What do we do?

11:11.868 --> 11:12.801
I don't know, man.

11:12.869 --> 11:13.802
I can't shake him.

11:13.870 --> 11:15.003
I can't shake Sofia, either.

11:15.070 --> 11:17.606
Unless... you thinking what I'm thinking?

11:17.673 --> 11:18.840
Double friend-off.

11:18.908 --> 11:20.241
Double friend-off?

11:20.309 --> 11:23.144
Watch.

11:23.212 --> 11:24.779
Look... it's a double pick play.

11:24.847 --> 11:26.180
Here's me.

11:26.248 --> 11:27.616
Ten yards out. There's Lane.

11:27.683 --> 11:29.250
Cut right, buttonhook back.

11:29.318 --> 11:33.755
You. I want you to go in motion
at the blue flowers, okay?

11:33.823 --> 11:35.256
Now, Sofia's gonna be on you.

11:35.324 --> 11:36.457
Serious pressure.

11:36.526 --> 11:40.495
All you got to do, zigzag, cut right,
gonna shake and bake, do your thing.

11:40.563 --> 11:41.863
Cut off Sofia.

11:41.931 --> 11:43.131
There we are. Got it?

11:43.198 --> 11:45.133
All right, we only get one shot at this.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.536
BOTH: Break!

11:51.908 --> 11:52.841
Hey.

11:52.909 --> 11:53.808
Whoa!

11:53.876 --> 11:54.475
Come see me.

11:54.544 --> 11:55.476
Baby. Let's go this way.

11:55.545 --> 11:56.511
Hey, honey.

11:56.579 --> 11:57.712
Whoa, whoa.

11:57.780 --> 11:59.714
Do you see these lovely
whites right here?

11:59.782 --> 12:02.450
No, come this way.

12:02.518 --> 12:04.686
You're gonna love these.

12:04.754 --> 12:07.956
See, these over here, I find these
to be incredibly intelligent.

12:08.024 --> 12:10.525
I'm just having such a great
day with you here. Oh!

12:10.593 --> 12:11.526
Pete.

12:11.594 --> 12:12.527
Ruxin?

12:12.595 --> 12:13.528
What's up, man?

12:13.596 --> 12:14.529
This is crazy.

12:14.597 --> 12:15.730
What are you guys doing here?

12:15.798 --> 12:16.965
We're <i>flower</i> shopping.

12:17.033 --> 12:19.534
Oh. Oh, Sofia, have you
met my friend Lane?

12:19.602 --> 12:20.902
Lane, this is my wife Sofia.

12:20.970 --> 12:22.037
She loves orchids.

12:22.104 --> 12:23.137
<i>Enchanté.</i>

12:23.205 --> 12:25.674
<i>Well, that's crazy because
Lane has a very adventurous</i>

12:25.741 --> 12:26.908
<i>color palette.</i>

12:26.976 --> 12:29.744
<i>I experience color very
vividly, like a deaf person.</i>

12:29.812 --> 12:30.912
<i>Wow, that's amazing.</i>

12:30.980 --> 12:32.914
<i>Rodney thought these were chrysanthemums.</i>

12:32.982 --> 12:35.516
<i>Yeah. And begonias are
the same as edelweiss.</i>

12:35.585 --> 12:37.686
<i>(laughing)</i>

12:37.753 --> 12:40.321
<i>Wow, um, maybe you can help
me pick out some orchids?</i>

12:40.389 --> 12:43.592
<i>Are you looking for something
more brash or apologetic?</i>

12:43.659 --> 12:45.226
<i>I don't know. I don't know.</i>

12:45.294 --> 12:46.494
<i>Maybe a little bit of both?</i>

12:46.562 --> 12:47.929
<i>Okay. Shops are my specialty.</i>

12:47.997 --> 12:48.930
<i>Yeah?</i>

12:48.998 --> 12:51.733
<i>I've been called the "girl
talk" of the floral world.</i>

12:51.801 --> 12:52.734
<i>I like that.</i>

12:52.802 --> 12:53.735
<i>(whispering): Excuse me.</i>

12:53.803 --> 12:55.036
<i>Sorry.</i>

12:55.104 --> 12:57.572
<i>Hey, guys, can we watch?</i>

12:57.640 --> 12:58.573
<i>Watching football, yeah?</i>

12:58.641 --> 12:59.574
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:59.642 --> 13:02.577
<i>I've actually encountered some
of these orchids in the wild.</i>

13:02.645 --> 13:04.212
<i>I spent some time on the Amazon River.</i>

13:04.279 --> 13:05.213
<i>Wow.</i>

13:05.280 --> 13:07.215
<i>Some of the natives down
there have never even seen</i>

13:07.282 --> 13:09.417
<i>turntables, so I took out my
ones and twos, and I performed</i>

13:09.485 --> 13:10.619
<i>for them.</i>

13:10.686 --> 13:13.554
<i>Wow! Oh, my God, I can't wait
to tell Rodney that story.</i>

13:13.623 --> 13:14.555
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

13:14.624 --> 13:16.190
<i>What are you even doing with that guy?</i>

13:16.258 --> 13:18.627
<i>I mean, you're</i> like an orchid,
and he's like a... a little

13:18.694 --> 13:19.694
Jewish weed.

13:19.762 --> 13:22.563
I can say that because I'm Jewish.

13:22.632 --> 13:25.867
I attend Episcopalian services, but ironically...
He's going, he's going in!

13:25.935 --> 13:27.235
He's going in!

13:27.302 --> 13:28.236
(engine starts)

13:28.303 --> 13:29.237
What's going on?

13:29.304 --> 13:31.640
(laughs): We're going to work.

13:31.707 --> 13:33.407
All-time greatest friend-off!

13:33.475 --> 13:35.977
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:36.045 --> 13:40.148
So I'm in Chalupa Batman's crib
because the root of all my

13:40.215 --> 13:41.616
problems stem from my childhood?

13:41.684 --> 13:44.418
No. There's only one chair in
here... <i>and</i> I wanted to see

13:44.486 --> 13:46.821
if the crib could withstand
the weight of an adult male.

13:46.889 --> 13:49.223
Looks like I got a new bed
in a couple of years.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.926
You know, I get no respect, Taco.

13:51.994 --> 13:53.795
You get more respect than I do.

13:53.863 --> 13:54.796
I'm a real doctor.

13:54.864 --> 13:56.798
You've been doing this for how long?

13:56.866 --> 13:57.799
One week, part-time.

13:57.867 --> 14:00.835
I'm surprised that by now you
haven't accepted the friend-off.

14:00.903 --> 14:03.905
All those guys downstairs have
attempted it multiple times.

14:03.973 --> 14:04.939
Really?

14:05.007 --> 14:07.642
I mean, they... they just
kind of like tolerate me.

14:07.710 --> 14:09.177
The monitor's on upstairs.

14:09.244 --> 14:11.846
So, what, I'm just like the
hot girl's fat friend?

14:11.914 --> 14:14.115
Well, they compare it more
to living with herpes.

14:14.183 --> 14:15.449
Hence the nickname, "Flare."

14:15.517 --> 14:16.617
No, no, that's a good thing.

14:16.686 --> 14:19.654
Remember, like... like, I got
flair, like that cool pen.

14:19.722 --> 14:20.855
Why would he think that?

14:20.923 --> 14:22.023
That pen is lame.

14:22.091 --> 14:24.125
I need to get respect for myself.

14:24.193 --> 14:25.526
I mean, no one likes me.

14:25.594 --> 14:26.861
No... one likes you.

14:26.929 --> 14:27.862
Yes, that's true.

14:27.930 --> 14:29.097
Well, what am I going to do?

14:29.165 --> 14:31.199
I'm in a terrible place emotionally.

14:31.266 --> 14:33.201
Should we not be listening to this?

14:33.268 --> 14:34.202
Yeah, let's turn this off.

14:34.269 --> 14:35.203
Wait, that was rhetorical.

14:35.270 --> 14:37.205
It's manifesting itself all over.

14:37.272 --> 14:38.840
I have pubic alopecia.

14:38.908 --> 14:39.841
Oh, my God.

14:39.909 --> 14:40.842
Whoa.

14:40.910 --> 14:42.844
So, you're completely bald down there?

14:42.912 --> 14:43.845
Not completely.

14:43.913 --> 14:46.550
More like Matt Lauer like a year ago.

14:46.670 --> 14:47.903
Kind of like Gene Shalit's face.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.371
You know, just clumps.

14:49.439 --> 14:50.606
Oh, my God.

14:50.674 --> 14:53.275
He looks like a stray pubic dog.

14:53.343 --> 14:55.444
I'm going to stop you right there.

14:55.512 --> 14:58.814
It is not uncommon in my therapy
sessions for me to zone out, so

14:58.882 --> 15:01.750
I'm going to do that right now,
but feel free to keep talking,

15:01.818 --> 15:03.118
even if I start snoring.

15:03.186 --> 15:04.386
(clears throat)

15:04.454 --> 15:06.989
I've also been experiencing
masturbation impotence.

15:07.056 --> 15:08.557
And I'm back.

15:08.625 --> 15:09.925
Oh, my God!

15:09.993 --> 15:11.326
He's rubbing out blanks.

15:11.394 --> 15:15.097
You mean, after six rounds, the
cobra's no longer shooting venom?

15:15.164 --> 15:17.099
No, I don't even get to the first round.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.101
I don't even make it into the ring.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.604
It's like his dick knows that
the hand belongs to Andre, and

15:21.671 --> 15:22.805
can't get hard for him.

15:22.873 --> 15:26.609
Just get this odd, chubby mass.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.243
A wet spaghetti noodle.

15:28.311 --> 15:29.478
It looks like the Shmoo.

15:29.546 --> 15:30.646
Just flopping around.

15:30.714 --> 15:33.682
You know, and I tried really hard to,
like, make something happen, you know.

15:33.750 --> 15:34.683
Uh-huh.

15:34.751 --> 15:38.487
It did, but what came out was
clear, and it tasted like vinegar.

15:38.555 --> 15:40.489
I have a sample if you
want to look at it.

15:40.557 --> 15:41.490
Interesting.

15:41.558 --> 15:42.691
Hello, message board.

15:42.759 --> 15:46.629
Stop, this is the great thing
that we can never ever mention.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.631
Oh, God, it's an unmentionable.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.099
To not talk about this
is going to be so hard.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.301
Oh, no, it's not. (Laughs)

15:53.369 --> 15:54.870
No, see, you can't do that.

15:54.938 --> 15:56.972
I mean, this is just going
to open up the floodgates.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.974
No, no floodgates are being opened.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.308
It works so many ways.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.677
It's a river of puns.

16:01.745 --> 16:02.678
It's unending.

16:02.746 --> 16:03.679
You can't bring it up.

16:03.747 --> 16:04.880
Yes, he can't bring it up.

16:04.948 --> 16:06.381
Ruxin, you have to stop.

16:06.449 --> 16:09.652
You want to tell a bird not to fly?

16:09.719 --> 16:10.986
Unmentionable.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.120
I'm with Kevin on this.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.289
Fine.

16:14.357 --> 16:15.357
Hey, what's going on?

16:15.425 --> 16:16.358
Okay, come here.

16:16.426 --> 16:18.360
Andre and Taco on the
baby monitor upstairs.

16:18.428 --> 16:21.797
Unbelievable... No, see, we should
just shut this right off because, you

16:21.865 --> 16:24.800
know, it's fake doctor/patient
confidentiality, and... shut it off.

16:24.868 --> 16:26.802
Jenny, what are you talking about?

16:26.870 --> 16:28.837
They don't know that we can
hear what they're saying.

16:28.905 --> 16:29.838
This is incredible.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.874
I know, that's why we should
shut it off because they don't

16:31.942 --> 16:32.875
know that we can hear them.

16:32.943 --> 16:33.876
Oh, exactly.

16:33.944 --> 16:36.979
They don't know we're listening,
just like, perhaps, I didn't

16:37.047 --> 16:41.984
know someone else was listening when I
was discussing trading RGIII with Ruxin.

16:42.052 --> 16:44.352
He didn't have to trade him to me.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.420
Are you kidding me?

16:45.488 --> 16:48.390
I refuse to be a pawn in your
psychosexual chess match.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.826
Wait a minute, you don't
even need quarterbacks.

16:50.894 --> 16:51.894
He sat on your bench.

16:51.962 --> 16:54.830
I'm playing you next week, and
our records were so close.

16:54.898 --> 16:56.398
I just needed you to lose a few.

16:56.466 --> 16:58.100
Oh, this is low.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.267
I'm sorry.

16:59.335 --> 17:02.270
Guys, your marriage is working
worse than Andre's dick.

17:02.338 --> 17:04.006
Ruxin.

17:04.074 --> 17:06.742
Andre has masturbation impotence.

17:06.810 --> 17:07.776
Unmentionable.

17:07.844 --> 17:08.777
Unmentionable!

17:08.845 --> 17:09.778
Are you serious?

17:09.846 --> 17:11.780
Yes, but listen, we're not
talking about it, we're not

17:11.848 --> 17:16.284
discussing it, just like we're not
discussing what just happened here.

17:16.352 --> 17:19.186
Bye.

17:19.255 --> 17:20.521
Wow.

17:20.589 --> 17:22.057
Andre's not doing well.

17:22.125 --> 17:25.560
In all my week as an unlicensed,
illegally practicing therapist,

17:25.628 --> 17:27.695
I have never seen someone so depressed.

17:27.763 --> 17:28.597
Is there anything we can do?

17:28.665 --> 17:29.297
Yes, actually.

17:30.313 --> 17:31.738
Yes, there is.

17:38.477 --> 17:41.446
I'd like to thank you all for
coming to therapy today.

17:41.566 --> 17:43.767
Before we get started, I
would like to discuss the

17:43.835 --> 17:45.101
uncomfortable matter of my fee.

17:45.169 --> 17:48.104
I think we're all very comfortable
that there will be no fee, yeah.

17:48.172 --> 17:49.406
Oh, Andre.

17:49.474 --> 17:50.741
Thanks for joining us.

17:50.809 --> 17:52.108
Hello, "friends."

17:52.176 --> 17:54.244
Now, Andre, would you like
to go around the room and

17:54.312 --> 17:56.279
express your emotions
in the form of a hug?

17:56.348 --> 17:57.581
No, I'm not gonna hug them.

17:57.649 --> 17:58.582
I'm angry at them.

17:58.650 --> 18:00.617
Well, then, give them angry hugs.

18:00.685 --> 18:03.186
All right.

18:03.254 --> 18:07.023
I love you, but I'm angry at you.

18:07.091 --> 18:08.024
No, all of us?

18:08.092 --> 18:10.026
I love you, but I'm mad at you.

18:10.094 --> 18:11.027
Oh, you're sweating on me.

18:11.095 --> 18:13.029
All right, two out of four... that's good.

18:13.097 --> 18:14.030
Yeah, we get the idea.

18:14.098 --> 18:15.031
Doesn't it feel good?

18:15.099 --> 18:16.032
Kind of did.

18:16.100 --> 18:20.871
For our first exercise, I'm going
to pull out Andre's inner voice.

18:20.938 --> 18:22.506
A sock puppet?

18:22.574 --> 18:25.141
Yes, you're going to take
this pin, and you're going to

18:25.209 --> 18:27.845
pinpoint where everyone
in this room hurt you.

18:27.912 --> 18:28.846
(imitates French accent):

18:28.913 --> 18:29.847
Hello, everyone.

18:29.914 --> 18:30.981
What voice is this?

18:31.048 --> 18:32.349
That's my inner voice.

18:32.417 --> 18:33.384
It's a Frenchman.

18:33.451 --> 18:36.152
You guys all know my favorite
place in the world is France.

18:36.220 --> 18:37.220
Have you been?

18:37.288 --> 18:38.221
No.

18:38.289 --> 18:41.324
Andre, we don't need to hear the
backstory of your sock puppet; just go.

18:41.393 --> 18:42.325
Okay, fine.

18:42.394 --> 18:45.061
Pete, you really... Andre,
your lips are moving.

18:45.129 --> 18:47.964
Look, I've never done
ventriloquism before.

18:48.032 --> 18:50.166
All right, if you'd give me a
marionette, I would have no

18:50.234 --> 18:51.334
problem doing it, okay?

18:51.403 --> 18:53.837
Andre, we went to your Level
2 marionette workshop.

18:53.905 --> 18:54.838
It stunk.

18:54.906 --> 18:55.839
Want me not to do a voice?

18:55.907 --> 18:56.840
Yeah, just do your own voice.

18:56.908 --> 18:58.842
Okay, I'm going to show you
where you all hurt me.

18:58.910 --> 18:59.843
Jenny, you hurt me here.

18:59.911 --> 19:00.844
In your butt?

19:00.912 --> 19:01.845
Not my butt.

19:01.913 --> 19:04.047
There's no... the puppet doesn't
have a butt; it's his back.

19:04.115 --> 19:05.315
You stabbed me in the back.

19:05.383 --> 19:08.719
Well, get used to that because she stabs
everyone in the back at some point.

19:08.787 --> 19:09.853
No, it was a valid trade!

19:09.921 --> 19:12.322
If I did that to you, you...
Guys, guys, guys, please!

19:12.390 --> 19:16.026
Your loveless marriage
is not the issue today.

19:16.093 --> 19:19.897
Let's please try to focus on a
problem that we can actually solve.

19:19.964 --> 19:21.064
Yes, thank you.

19:21.132 --> 19:24.067
This next exercise is
an honesty exercise.

19:24.135 --> 19:27.538
Now, Andre, please put on the
pride helmet, and now everyone's

19:27.605 --> 19:30.674
going to get a shot at hitting
you with the truth hammer.

19:30.742 --> 19:31.675
Yes.

19:31.743 --> 19:32.676
Oh, I'm going first.

19:32.744 --> 19:33.677
(French accent): You cannot!

19:33.745 --> 19:34.778
You cannot.

19:34.846 --> 19:36.279
No, no, no, no, no.

19:36.347 --> 19:40.584
(normal voice): Okay, look, I
don't need a hammer or a helmet

19:40.652 --> 19:44.387
or this sock puppet to
tell you guys how I feel.

19:44.456 --> 19:47.624
I know you think that I'm, like,
this hard guy, but I'm actually

19:47.692 --> 19:52.429
really soft, and lately, things
have been rubbing me the wrong way.

19:52.497 --> 19:57.267
And it's really frustrating when I
can't come to you... Oh, my God.

19:57.335 --> 19:59.235
...to express myself, okay?

19:59.303 --> 20:00.370
This is great.

20:00.438 --> 20:02.405
This is why therapy is beneficial.

20:02.474 --> 20:04.708
Andre's in a stiff situation, you guys.

20:04.776 --> 20:05.876
That's not what I heard.

20:05.944 --> 20:06.877
Ruxin, don't.

20:06.945 --> 20:07.878
No, this is good.

20:07.946 --> 20:08.879
Don't hold back.

20:08.947 --> 20:10.914
Well, if we were holding back,
Andre would yank it out.

20:10.982 --> 20:13.316
Look, I just want to be able to unload.

20:13.384 --> 20:14.551
Yes, Andre, unload.

20:14.619 --> 20:16.152
Release... release everything.

20:16.220 --> 20:18.789
You can't, 'cause you're
rubbing out blanks.

20:18.857 --> 20:21.091
What are you... what...
You're cupping mud.

20:21.158 --> 20:23.594
You have masturbation impotence.

20:23.661 --> 20:24.595
That's good.

20:24.662 --> 20:25.596
This is good.

20:25.663 --> 20:26.630
Now we're communicating.

20:26.698 --> 20:28.431
This is great.

20:29.093 --> 20:30.691
Who the hell are you people?

20:30.963 --> 20:32.016
What are you doing here?

20:32.136 --> 20:34.685
Oh, we were just making fun of Andre's
masturbation impotence.

20:34.805 --> 20:37.992
My father's only been dead for two weeks,
and already there are squatters here?

20:38.112 --> 20:40.039
Taco, you said you rented this place.

20:40.159 --> 20:42.772
I believe the words I
used were "moved in."

20:43.206 --> 20:44.556
Oh, God. I'm calling the police.

20:44.676 --> 20:47.008
What? No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:47.128 --> 20:48.717
Hello? There is a group of perverts
here,

20:48.837 --> 20:50.909
and they broke into my
dead father's apartment.

20:51.029 --> 20:53.225
Okay, okay. We need to get out of here.
I'll bill you guys later.

20:53.345 --> 20:54.397
We got to go! We got to get out of here!

20:54.517 --> 20:57.085
Move, move, move, move, move!

20:58.187 --> 20:59.599
- Come on, get out of here.
- Shit!

21:00.044 --> 21:02.212
- I'm feeling a little bit better.
- We've got a breakthrough.

21:02.332 --> 21:04.069
A breakthrough!
