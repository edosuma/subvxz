00:35.767 --> 00:42.525
Glorious and powerful Death,
taking advantage of your kindness ...

00:42.647 --> 00:46.925
I ask you this favour: as the invincible master that

00:47.047 --> 00:51.245
you are, I beg that you vanquish my enemies,

00:51.367 --> 00:57.761
conquer him who is conquering me, 
like Jesus conquered on the cross.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.198
My daughter is missing. 

25:03.687 --> 25:06.997
Please tell me where she is. 

25:18.487 --> 25:20.523
She is not your daughter. 

25:31.407 --> 25:35.320
The father, please come. 

25:59.167 --> 26:04.241
I see swirling red flowers. 

26:04.367 --> 26:11.284
And flowing curtains in the wind, 
as in the footsteps of Satan. 

26:12.887 --> 26:18.280
They come in the night, 
with fire in their eyes. 

26:18.407 --> 26:22.844
Who? Who has come? 
- ... darkness in their heart. 

26:22.967 --> 26:29.520
Her little head is under the bed hiding. 

26:29.647 --> 26:35.324
The cross falls to the floor, as do the curtains. 

26:35.447 --> 26:42.637
The curtains are torn as the man falls. 

26:48.767 --> 26:55.115
The true meaning of enlightenment 
is to see in the dark ... 

26:55.247 --> 26:57.602
with open eyes. 

31:05.407 --> 31:09.116
Please, DoÃ±a, you must help me. 

31:13.767 --> 31:15.837
Come closer. 

31:17.047 --> 31:21.916
Please, tell me where Toby is. 

31:24.327 --> 31:25.999
Can you see her? 

31:29.887 --> 31:36.998
Do you know the story of the cranes 
from the lost city of the Aztecs? 

31:40.847 --> 31:45.557
On dark, moonless nights ... 

31:45.687 --> 31:50.283
at times, they flew
back to their homeland ... 

31:53.167 --> 31:55.044
to welcome death. 

31:57.367 --> 32:02.202
The darkness that you are trying 
to avoid ... 

32:03.367 --> 32:06.677
says you must return ... 

32:08.487 --> 32:12.002
to your roots. 

32:14.927 --> 32:20.763
Go back.  Return.

33:25.047 --> 33:26.765
Hello. Wait, I can't hear you. 

33:28.567 --> 33:35.837
Josefina? She is working with a client, 
baby. But I am here. 

33:37.607 --> 33:43.204
Should I send her a message?
Who is this anyway? 

33:45.447 --> 33:50.441
Robert? 
Is that you, Robert? 

37:03.727 --> 37:10.519
Do you not hear the phone? 
- Don't you!? We're watching TV. 

37:26.527 --> 37:29.200
Josefina, telephone! Josefina!

37:39.927 --> 37:42.760
Hello? Yes, Josefina. 

37:44.567 --> 37:48.606
My God, Robert. 

37:49.447 --> 37:54.077
It's been so long.
How are you? 

37:54.207 --> 37:58.678
Lorena has become eight or nine? 
- Eleven. 

37:58.807 --> 38:04.404
Eleven! How is she? 
- She was kidnapped two days ago. 

38:04.527 --> 38:12.115
Kidnapped? Blessed Death, 
glorious Death, mighty Death ... 

38:12.247 --> 38:18.925
conquer him who is conquering me, 
like Jesus conquered on the cross, Amen.

38:21.727 --> 38:28.075
Listen, I need your help. 
- Tell me what I can do. 

38:28.207 --> 38:32.644
I must know who brings the girls from
the US these days. 

38:32.767 --> 38:37.841
You think she's taken? 
- I don't know. Hopefully not. 

38:37.967 --> 38:43.678
You know how it goes. Everyone is
quiet but I will ask around a bit. 

38:43.807 --> 38:46.401
Thanks, Josefina. 
- Stay well. 

42:07.807 --> 42:12.676
Goodbye Captain. 
- Sanchez, how are you? 

42:42.447 --> 42:45.484
Robert? It's been a while. 
How's it going? 

43:52.087 --> 43:55.045
Tomorrow night, 7:00pm, St. Dismas 

51:25.447 --> 51:29.406
Carolina? I'm here.

51:59.287 --> 52:02.757
Good God, Carolina. 

52:14.207 --> 52:17.517
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 

57:10.327 --> 57:12.887
He was not there. 

59:22.167 --> 59:26.763
So this must be where they keep
all the beautiful girls hidden. 

01:00:09.807 --> 01:00:15.598
The transvestites are free to go.
Get out of here. 

01:00:18.327 --> 01:00:20.318
Pervert. 

01:00:26.007 --> 01:00:27.804
Until tomorrow. 

01:01:43.027 --> 01:01:45.481
Where is that foreigner, Marco? 

01:03:19.907 --> 01:03:22.020
Ten dollars per hour. 

01:03:24.947 --> 01:03:26.366
Twenty. 

01:10:43.167 --> 01:10:47.001
St Death, this is Robert. 

01:10:48.447 --> 01:10:52.360
I'm back and I'm now faced with you again... 

01:10:55.727 --> 01:10:57.399
for the last time. 

01:11:01.927 --> 01:11:05.840
Dear Death, 
I do not need your protection... 

01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:09.876
but my family does. 

01:11:12.487 --> 01:11:16.082
Protect my loved ones 
against my enemies. 

01:11:40.887 --> 01:11:45.597
conquer him who is conquering me, 
like Jesus conquered on the cross.

01:12:29.367 --> 01:12:31.403
Is there anyone there?

01:14:32.407 --> 01:14:35.683
Madam, is everything all right? 

01:14:48.047 --> 01:14:50.845
Open the door, madam. 

01:14:52.407 --> 01:14:56.719
Please open the door. Is everything okay? 

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:02.437
Open the door, madam! 

01:15:39.647 --> 01:15:45.722
St Death, we beg you... 

01:15:45.847 --> 01:15:51.205
face to face, 
holy of holy, cup to cup. 

01:15:52.647 --> 01:15:56.003
St Death is one of us ... 

01:15:56.127 --> 01:16:03.397
Now our newest daughter,
a wife she is to become. 

01:16:05.607 --> 01:16:08.485
St Death, show us the way. 

01:16:10.047 --> 01:16:12.959
St Death, protect us ... 

01:16:15.807 --> 01:16:22.280
and share this holy communion with us. 

01:16:25.807 --> 01:16:29.004
St Death, protect us. 

01:16:51.247 --> 01:16:56.002
The blood of St Death ... 

01:16:56.127 --> 01:17:01.360
will provide fire to
flow through your veins. 

01:17:21.287 --> 01:17:24.165
No sin ... 

01:17:27.647 --> 01:17:35.440
of yours will ever be remembered. 

01:20:38.407 --> 01:20:40.398
Why me?
