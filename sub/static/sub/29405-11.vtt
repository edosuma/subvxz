00:03.217 --> 00:05.430
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

00:05.433 --> 00:07.031
I'm your mother.

00:07.033 --> 00:08.499
I don't talk you into things.

00:08.501 --> 00:10.217
I tell you what to do.

00:10.219 --> 00:13.071
And because I was in labor
for 18 hours, you do it.

00:13.074 --> 00:15.464
I don't see how that obligates
me to fall 30,000 feet

00:15.466 --> 00:16.707
out of a plane with you.

00:16.709 --> 00:19.060
Oh, please. It's 15,000 tops.

00:19.062 --> 00:22.488
We made a pact to spend more
mother-daughter time together.

00:22.491 --> 00:23.915
Bucket listing out of a plane

00:23.918 --> 00:25.493
is not a mother-daughter activity.

00:25.496 --> 00:27.087
It's a bet you make with gravity.

00:27.090 --> 00:30.334
Lizzy, this is important to me.

00:30.337 --> 00:31.969
Life is short.

00:31.972 --> 00:34.173
Gotta grab the bull by the horns.

00:34.176 --> 00:36.701
I swear, Dad dying made you weird.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.563
It's not like I have
grandkids to keep me busy.

00:39.698 --> 00:41.490
Wonder if our instructor is single.

00:41.492 --> 00:43.367
- Stefan...
- Mom!

00:43.369 --> 00:45.252
Is that our plane?

00:53.763 --> 00:56.581
We're approaching altitude. We ready?

00:56.583 --> 00:58.416
Ready! Time to seize the day!

01:00.603 --> 01:02.770
Okay, ladies.

01:02.772 --> 01:03.887
I'll count it down.

01:09.562 --> 01:11.228
Oh, my God! No!

01:11.230 --> 01:12.413
Baby, no!

01:18.704 --> 01:20.122
_

01:20.232 --> 01:21.259
_

01:21.331 --> 01:22.082
_

01:22.085 --> 01:23.909
_

01:24.692 --> 01:26.201
It looks like his parachute

01:26.203 --> 01:27.278
is snagged on something.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.871
He's caught underneath the airplane.

01:28.873 --> 01:30.873
He hasn't said anything on the radio.

01:30.875 --> 01:32.040
Might not be conscious.

01:32.042 --> 01:33.709
Let's hope not, for his sake.

01:33.711 --> 01:35.544
That's a memory he's
not gonna wanna savor.

01:35.546 --> 01:38.289
We got us a concussion,
possible spinal injury.

01:38.291 --> 01:41.142
And he's getting buffeted by
turbulence under the plane.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.144
We're gonna need to
treat him for exposure.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.730
Yeah, we haven't talked about
how we're getting him down.

01:45.733 --> 01:47.148
How's the leg?

01:47.150 --> 01:49.433
Uh, screws are out. Feeling great.

01:49.435 --> 01:50.726
All right.

01:50.728 --> 01:52.319
Dispatch, this is Captain 118.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.605
Can you get me in that pilot's ear?

01:54.607 --> 01:56.991
Poor Stefan. He was so young!

01:56.993 --> 01:58.617
Mom, he's not dead. You heard the pilot.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.478
He's still hanging from
underneath the plane.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.765
Oh, baby, planes can't fly forever.

02:02.768 --> 02:04.838
Wild One, this is Captain Nash, LAFD.

02:04.841 --> 02:06.790
- Do you copy?
- Yes, sir, I do.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.251
Hope you guys figured
out how to land this

02:08.252 --> 02:09.613
without killing my friend.

02:09.622 --> 02:11.408
What kind of headwind
reading you getting today?

02:11.410 --> 02:12.956
Around 10 knots.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.595
I need you to turn into that wind

02:14.598 --> 02:15.792
and make an approach.

02:15.794 --> 02:18.086
I'm sorry, you want me to land?

02:18.088 --> 02:19.463
With Stefan still under the plane?

02:19.465 --> 02:20.848
I just need you to get low enough

02:20.850 --> 02:21.960
so that we can free you.

02:21.963 --> 02:23.634
Wait, where are you guys gonna be?

02:23.636 --> 02:26.837
Right below you.

02:28.307 --> 02:29.579
All right, Cap, we got him.

02:29.582 --> 02:31.342
Coming in hot behind us.

02:31.344 --> 02:33.511
Okay, hang tight and
keep your hands ready.

02:33.513 --> 02:35.504
Wild One, we're in position.

02:35.507 --> 02:37.606
- I see you.
- Too high, Cap!

02:37.608 --> 02:38.815
Tell him to drop it!

02:38.817 --> 02:39.937
Keep dropping.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.186
Lower.

02:43.856 --> 02:45.614
Damn it, Cap! We missed him!

02:45.616 --> 02:47.875
Too high and too fast!

02:47.877 --> 02:49.284
Can you drop your speed any lower?

02:49.286 --> 02:50.790
Any slower and we're gonna stall.

02:50.792 --> 02:51.995
What about your flap?

02:51.997 --> 02:53.380
I do that, there's no going back.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.553
I'm gonna have to put her down.

02:54.555 --> 02:56.050
Got it. Last shot.

02:56.052 --> 02:58.552
Buck, Eddie, we've got
one more shot at this.

02:58.554 --> 03:02.039
Okay, Wild One, put her down.

03:02.041 --> 03:03.708
All right, Cap, we see him!

03:03.710 --> 03:06.009
Coming in hot behind us!

03:06.011 --> 03:09.063
That's it, that's it! Another 150 feet!

03:09.065 --> 03:13.884
Lower, lower, lower! Keep it steady.

03:13.886 --> 03:15.852
That's it. We're almost there.

03:18.983 --> 03:20.886
- Come on.
- All right, Cap.

03:20.889 --> 03:22.150
Keep it steady.

03:22.152 --> 03:24.528
Right there, okay. Come on.

03:24.530 --> 03:25.988
Go, go, go!

03:32.090 --> 03:34.162
We got him!

03:38.335 --> 03:39.744
Is he gonna be all right?

03:39.746 --> 03:42.004
He's a little beat up, but
I think he'll fly again.

03:42.006 --> 03:43.547
Just not sure he's gonna want to.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.552
Hope this'll be the end of your flying.

03:48.554 --> 03:51.605
And your matchmaking.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.137
Uh, are you boys single?

03:57.354 --> 04:00.158

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

04:06.289 --> 04:07.772
So what's going on?

04:07.774 --> 04:09.623
Every time you guys
sit us down like this,

04:09.625 --> 04:11.731
it seems to be bad news.

04:11.734 --> 04:13.238
No, it's not.

04:13.241 --> 04:15.629
We just wanted to give you guys
and update on what's happening

04:15.631 --> 04:16.747
with your dad.

04:16.749 --> 04:19.776
Right, um, I saw my doctor,

04:19.779 --> 04:24.588
and the good news is the
tumor didn't grow, okay?

04:24.590 --> 04:27.738
Now, but the bad news is,
it... it didn't shrink, either.

04:27.741 --> 04:29.885
So what now?

04:29.887 --> 04:32.763
So your dad is gonna have surgery.

04:32.765 --> 04:34.045
Brain surgery?

04:34.892 --> 04:36.231
Yeah.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.060
But I thought that you
didn't wanna do surgery.

04:38.062 --> 04:39.987
That's why you did the radiation.

04:39.989 --> 04:41.229
Well...

04:41.231 --> 04:43.474
Surgery can be complicated.

04:43.476 --> 04:45.609
That's why they wanted to
try the treatments first,

04:45.612 --> 04:47.422
and now they just wanna
try something else.

04:47.425 --> 04:48.565
That's all.

04:48.568 --> 04:50.290
So they just take it out
and then you're cured, right?

04:50.292 --> 04:52.316
W-well, hopefully yes.

04:52.318 --> 04:54.451
You know, they'll take
out as much as possible

04:54.453 --> 04:57.746
and then maybe do more
radiation after that.

04:57.748 --> 04:59.247
Wait, they're gonna cut open your brain

04:59.249 --> 05:00.631
and they might not even get all of it?

05:00.633 --> 05:02.676
Yeah, May, no.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.678
This is the best option right now.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.590
That's what they said
about the radiation.

05:06.593 --> 05:08.349
Look, look.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.167
Your dad has a great team of doctors

05:10.169 --> 05:11.293
and we're gonna trust them,

05:11.295 --> 05:13.838
and we are gonna stay positive.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.357
Yes, yes. Your... your mother is right.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.809
Okay, we're gonna carry
on business as usual.

05:18.811 --> 05:21.846
We are not gonna let this
stop us from doing the things

05:21.848 --> 05:24.531
that we know we need to do, okay?

05:24.533 --> 05:26.650
Like studying for your math test.

05:26.652 --> 05:28.373
We still got that deal, right?

05:28.376 --> 05:29.986
Oh, man, come on.

05:29.988 --> 05:33.448
A-minus or above, it's
you, me, and GameStop.

05:33.450 --> 05:34.708
And your Gold Card.

05:34.710 --> 05:37.108
What? I'm just kidding.

05:37.111 --> 05:38.364
And my Gold Card.

05:38.367 --> 05:39.713
Great, I'm gonna go study right now.

05:45.129 --> 05:48.555
Bone has fused nicely
where the screws were,

05:48.557 --> 05:51.007
and there's minimal scar tissue.

05:51.009 --> 05:52.893
I... I feel good, Doc.

05:52.895 --> 05:56.346
I mean, I was... I was standing
on top of a moving fire truck

05:56.348 --> 05:58.682
the other day. Not even a twinge.

05:58.684 --> 06:02.403
I'm gonna pretend that
I did not hear that part.

06:02.405 --> 06:05.060
I'm not interested in
operating on your other leg.

06:07.193 --> 06:08.460
So what about the clots?

06:09.912 --> 06:11.958
Scans are clear.

06:11.961 --> 06:14.860
No sign of clots since we took
you off of the blood thinners.

06:16.326 --> 06:18.994
I think those screws were
the source of your problem.

06:18.996 --> 06:21.088
Uh, so that's it?

06:21.090 --> 06:24.108
They're gone and I... I
don't need to see you anymore?

06:24.111 --> 06:26.522
As long as you don't get
crushed by another fire truck.

06:26.525 --> 06:28.211
Whoa, come on. Too soon, Doc.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.263
- Just...
- Sorry.

06:29.265 --> 06:31.047
Mr. Buckley,

06:31.049 --> 06:34.418
it is my pleasure to give
you a clean bill of health.

06:34.420 --> 06:37.387
So go get dressed and get out of here.

06:37.389 --> 06:40.015
Um, well, thank you.

06:40.017 --> 06:41.425
For everything.

06:41.427 --> 06:42.593
Um, no offense,

06:42.595 --> 06:45.687
but I hope I never see you again.

06:47.733 --> 06:49.934
Hey, you never know.

06:49.936 --> 06:51.401
Really?

06:57.109 --> 06:58.792
I don't understand why the water.

06:58.794 --> 06:59.868
All the ingredients I get,

06:59.870 --> 07:01.442
but who puts water in meatballs?

07:01.445 --> 07:03.939
It helps the meatballs not
turn into tiny little rocks,

07:03.942 --> 07:05.915
but they did not say how much water.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.137
What are you doing? Birthday rules.

07:10.139 --> 07:11.622
No help from the guest of honor.

07:11.624 --> 07:14.716
But it feels weird just
watching and not contributing.

07:14.718 --> 07:18.128
I'm not really a "woman,
make me food" kind of guy.

07:18.130 --> 07:19.914
Okay, fine. If you wanna help,

07:19.917 --> 07:21.192
figure out how long the meatballs need

07:21.194 --> 07:22.047
to cook in the sauce,

07:22.050 --> 07:23.266
because I would hate
for your birthday dinner

07:23.268 --> 07:24.468
to kill us.

07:24.470 --> 07:26.895
Meatball emergency. I'm on it.

07:26.897 --> 07:28.271
Where'd I put my phone?

07:28.273 --> 07:29.490
Bedroom, charger.

07:29.492 --> 07:30.657
Copy that.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.442
Oh, okay, let's see.

07:34.997 --> 07:36.238
That can't be right.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.305
Oh, my God.

07:38.361 --> 07:41.070
My father left me a voicemail.

07:41.073 --> 07:42.618
I can't believe it. He remembered.

07:42.621 --> 07:44.171
He never remembers my birthday.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.081
- That's sweet.
- It's a first.

07:47.326 --> 07:48.792
Nope, I got it.

07:48.794 --> 07:50.085
Listen to your message.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.849
- Hello.
- Hello.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.851
Is, uh, Howard home?

07:57.853 --> 07:59.397
He is. And you are?

07:59.400 --> 08:00.804
I'm Albert.

08:00.806 --> 08:02.673
Okay, are you a friend of his?

08:02.675 --> 08:06.026
No, he's my brother.

08:13.294 --> 08:15.536
Guess they didn't feed you
much on the flight over here.

08:16.553 --> 08:18.372
Nothing this good.

08:18.374 --> 08:20.542
This is delicious. You're
an amazing cook, Maddie.

08:20.545 --> 08:22.617
Thank you.

08:22.619 --> 08:24.952
I can't believe you guys
have never met before.

08:24.955 --> 08:26.261
I know.

08:26.264 --> 08:28.048
20 years old, and I've
never met my brother.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.701
Well, half-brother.

08:30.703 --> 08:32.318
I'm sorry about your birthday.

08:32.321 --> 08:34.504
If I had known, I would
have brought you something.

08:34.506 --> 08:36.056
Besides myself.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.541
It's okay.

08:37.543 --> 08:38.967
I wouldn't expect you to know.

08:38.969 --> 08:40.844
Clearly, Pop didn't.

08:40.846 --> 08:43.876
All he could talk about was
you running away from home.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.382
I did not run away.

08:48.353 --> 08:50.737
Yes, I ran away, but from him.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.023
You know how he is.

08:53.025 --> 08:54.391
Not really.

08:54.393 --> 08:56.305
He's suffocating.

08:56.308 --> 08:58.412
It's not enough to
finish university early.

08:58.414 --> 09:00.080
Now I must decide on a graduate school,

09:00.082 --> 09:01.415
except when he says decide,

09:01.417 --> 09:03.703
he means acquiesce.

09:03.706 --> 09:05.714
So what do you want to do?

09:06.997 --> 09:08.997
No idea.

09:08.999 --> 09:12.259
Finally, I'm starting to
see a family resemblance.

09:12.261 --> 09:14.514
That's why I came here.
I knew you'd understand.

09:15.839 --> 09:19.083
Yeah, I'm not really sure
I'm the right role model

09:19.085 --> 09:20.767
for you finding a career path.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.644
Your brother is being modest.

09:22.647 --> 09:25.513
He saves people all day long,
and he's really good at it.

09:25.515 --> 09:27.724
It's time I stopped
living in Father's shadow.

09:27.726 --> 09:29.225
I need to strike out on my own.

09:29.227 --> 09:30.955
And land on my couch?

09:32.281 --> 09:33.897
Only if it isn't any trouble.

09:33.899 --> 09:35.265
Of course it isn't.

09:35.267 --> 09:36.402
You're his brother.

09:36.405 --> 09:38.435
Of course you can stay.

09:38.437 --> 09:40.362
- For a visit.
- Thank you, Howard.

09:42.608 --> 09:44.458
To seizing the day.

09:52.209 --> 09:54.393
And seizing my birthday.

10:02.934 --> 10:04.644
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

10:04.647 --> 10:05.784
Oh, look at that!

10:05.787 --> 10:07.481
Ooh, baby!

10:07.483 --> 10:10.634
Ooh, whoa, that rainbow
trout is so perfect.

10:10.636 --> 10:12.794
Might as well have a pot
of gold at the end of it.

10:12.796 --> 10:14.729
What a beaut, hon. Well done.

10:14.731 --> 10:16.649
All right. Here you go, buddy.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.476
Cheryl, you weren't even looking.

10:19.478 --> 10:21.812
Come on, we said we
were doing this together.

10:21.814 --> 10:24.239
No, I said I would come with you.

10:24.241 --> 10:26.166
I didn't say, "Roger, please teach me

10:26.168 --> 10:28.485
how to catch a fish that I'm
not even allowed to keep."

10:28.487 --> 10:30.671
Come on, babe. Seize the day.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.172
Come on.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.387
- Okay.
- Come on.

10:33.390 --> 10:34.658
Here it comes.

10:34.660 --> 10:36.960
Go right through the, uh...
go right through the gill.

10:38.831 --> 10:40.067
There you go. Look at that.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.499
Here, you hold the pole.

10:42.501 --> 10:44.300
Oh, let me help you.

10:44.303 --> 10:45.444
We're gonna do this together.

10:45.446 --> 10:46.487
You're not gonna push me in, are you?

10:46.489 --> 10:47.563
So you gotta put your finger here.

10:47.565 --> 10:49.172
Look at this. Put your finger here.

10:49.175 --> 10:51.008
- Right.
- So now you bring it back,

10:51.010 --> 10:54.102
and then let go of your finger. Ah, hey!

10:54.104 --> 10:56.029
- There we go.
- Let go!

10:56.031 --> 10:57.181
There you go.

10:57.183 --> 10:58.314
Whoo!

10:58.316 --> 11:00.017
See how easy this is?

11:00.019 --> 11:01.368
It's very relaxing.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.487
Whoa!

11:05.490 --> 11:07.207
- Uh-oh.
- Fish on, fish on!

11:07.209 --> 11:08.950
Reel up. There you go.

11:08.952 --> 11:10.121
My queen of the sea.

11:10.124 --> 11:11.862
Oh, don't ever call me that again.

11:11.864 --> 11:13.455
You got a monster on there.

11:13.457 --> 11:15.549
All right, look at that!

11:15.551 --> 11:17.167
Whoo, first fish!

11:17.169 --> 11:19.369
Oh, man, I think the
bait was bigger than that.

11:20.389 --> 11:21.390
Hey, don't throw it back.

11:21.392 --> 11:23.055
I gotta get a picture of you two, first.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.836
You know, document the first catch.

11:24.839 --> 11:26.468
All right.

11:26.470 --> 11:28.212
No, no, no, not like
that. Okay, no, wait.

11:28.214 --> 11:30.013
Let me show you how
it's done. Let me see.

11:30.015 --> 11:32.566
Okay, see, what you do
is you extend the fish

11:32.568 --> 11:36.236
out and away from the body
towards the camera, see?

11:36.238 --> 11:37.540
Makes it look bigger, right?

11:37.543 --> 11:38.855
Very nifty trick.

11:38.857 --> 11:41.225
All right, now, you
really wanna get crazy?

11:41.227 --> 11:42.626
You give him one of these.

11:44.654 --> 11:46.230
Sashimi, anyone?

11:46.232 --> 11:47.397
Ew, Roger.

11:49.493 --> 11:50.638
Roger!

11:50.641 --> 11:52.928
Roger, oh!

11:54.797 --> 11:56.466
_

11:56.647 --> 11:59.500
_

12:05.601 --> 12:06.837
Ma'am, let us get in there.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.252
Oh.

12:08.254 --> 12:10.130
The fish just jumped down his throat.

12:10.133 --> 12:11.255
Does the fish have a hook in its mouth?

12:11.257 --> 12:12.514
No, no, no, I got that out.

12:12.516 --> 12:13.924
Okay, he's not breathing.

12:13.926 --> 12:15.683
It appears his airways are blocked.

12:15.685 --> 12:16.991
Let's try the breathing bag.

12:18.873 --> 12:20.616
I've got negative pressure.

12:20.619 --> 12:22.953
Must be looking at
total tracheal occlusion.

12:22.956 --> 12:24.697
His pulse is dropping, Cap.

12:24.700 --> 12:25.989
This thing's gotta come out now.

12:25.992 --> 12:27.195
He's gonna code.

12:27.197 --> 12:28.471
He almost died from a heart attack

12:28.473 --> 12:29.956
a few months ago. That's
why we came up here.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.211
We were supposed to be relaxing.

12:31.213 --> 12:32.086
Okay, what do you need, Hen?

12:32.088 --> 12:33.910
We need to get his mouth
open with a laryngoscope.

12:33.912 --> 12:35.411
Okay, coming in.

12:35.413 --> 12:36.963
What kind of fish was it?

12:36.965 --> 12:38.325
It was a little sucker, not very big.

12:38.327 --> 12:39.966
A... maybe a catfish.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.968
Strong and there are lots of spikes.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.920
Barbed shards on each fin.

12:43.922 --> 12:45.588
Throat tissue appears to be discolored.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.975
It looks like the gills
or maybe both are caught

12:48.977 --> 12:50.552
on his trachea.

12:50.554 --> 12:52.813
I'm gonna try to get it loose.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.298
This thing goes any deeper,

12:54.300 --> 12:56.099
it's not coming back out.

12:56.101 --> 12:59.986
Gills are done. Onto the fins.

13:02.232 --> 13:03.773
Clear.

13:03.775 --> 13:05.108
Gross!

13:06.778 --> 13:08.645
Ooh, oh!

13:08.647 --> 13:09.842
Voila.

13:11.408 --> 13:13.438
Oh, Roger! Oh, thank God!

13:13.441 --> 13:14.764
Okay, let's get him to the ER.

13:14.767 --> 13:16.763
Make sure that fish didn't
do any serious damage.

13:20.230 --> 13:21.916
Better than watching
paint dry, though, huh?

13:21.918 --> 13:23.293
Oh, God.

13:23.295 --> 13:25.962
Just stop almost dying on me, okay?

13:25.964 --> 13:29.015
I mean, I love you too much, you fool.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.017
- Hey.
- Oh!

13:37.577 --> 13:39.358
_

13:39.361 --> 13:41.978
What did you want me
to do? Kick the kid out?

13:41.981 --> 13:43.225
Let him sleep on the street?

13:43.228 --> 13:46.393
_

13:47.035 --> 13:50.370
Look, maybe you should ease up here.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.397
Give him some space, Pop.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.637
A few weeks of freedom,

13:53.640 --> 13:55.132
he'll probably come home on his own.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.651
_

13:57.654 --> 13:59.212
He's 20,

13:59.214 --> 14:00.971
and I was making my own decisions

14:00.974 --> 14:02.406
long before that age.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.883
_

14:03.886 --> 14:04.979
Was it, though?

14:04.982 --> 14:07.013
_

14:07.055 --> 14:09.671
_

14:09.674 --> 14:11.875
You never even tried.

14:11.877 --> 14:14.060
And by the way, I haven't failed.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.880
I have a good life. I have a good job.

14:16.883 --> 14:18.333
You know, saving lives.

14:18.336 --> 14:21.395
_

14:21.398 --> 14:23.679
_

14:23.682 --> 14:27.051
Your son, singular.

14:27.054 --> 14:28.923
Glad we cleared that up.

14:29.795 --> 14:31.243
_

14:38.044 --> 14:40.536
Hey, Chim, you mind if I take
home some of this birthday cake

14:40.538 --> 14:41.868
for Harry and May?

14:41.871 --> 14:43.872
- Sure, knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.409
How are they doing?

14:45.411 --> 14:47.001
How's Michael?

14:47.003 --> 14:48.762
Uh, he's upbeat. He's fighting.

14:48.764 --> 14:50.856
Radiation was supposed
to be his best shot

14:50.859 --> 14:52.674
Now we're all grappling
with pinning our hopes

14:52.677 --> 14:54.104
on his second best shot, surgery.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.127
How are the kids handling it?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.514
Well, I think Harry's
okay. I'm worried about May.

14:59.516 --> 15:00.757
She's got a better understanding

15:00.759 --> 15:02.337
of what's going on.

15:02.340 --> 15:04.444
That's 'cause older siblings
don't have the luxury

15:04.446 --> 15:06.204
of blissful ignorance.

15:06.207 --> 15:08.765
They understand the truth
even if they don't want to.

15:10.694 --> 15:13.754
Guessing it's not going
too well with Albert.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.290
- Maddie told you?
- Ooh, sorry.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.700
Was she not supposed to?

15:18.702 --> 15:20.277
Who's Albert?

15:20.279 --> 15:23.630
He's my younger
half-brother from Korea.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.472
He showed up on my doorstep.

15:25.475 --> 15:28.041
Not quite the birthday
surprise I was expecting.

15:28.044 --> 15:29.040
That's awesome.

15:29.043 --> 15:30.436
I didn't even know
you had a kid brother.

15:30.438 --> 15:31.546
Yeah, when do we get to meet him?

15:33.459 --> 15:36.404
Well, that doesn't
really seem necessary.

15:36.407 --> 15:37.884
He's gonna be leaving soon anyways.

15:37.887 --> 15:39.479
My dad insisted on it.

15:39.481 --> 15:40.814
Come on, you finally have a chance

15:40.816 --> 15:42.765
to get to know your brother.

15:42.767 --> 15:45.151
No, I don't know. It
just feels weird to me.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.320
Sure, we share some of the same DNA,

15:47.322 --> 15:49.489
but he's still practically
a stranger to me.

15:49.491 --> 15:50.823
I keep telling you.

15:50.826 --> 15:54.243
Family comes to us in
different ways, Chim.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.821
Lean in.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.447
And don't think you're
gonna send him home

15:57.449 --> 15:59.615
without meeting all of us.

15:59.617 --> 16:00.791
I know you.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.322
Uh, what is this?

16:05.324 --> 16:09.175
"Talking points regarding
Henrietta and Karen"?

16:09.177 --> 16:11.511
Social services is vetting Karen and me

16:11.513 --> 16:14.498
to become foster parents.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.800
We listed each and every
one of you as references

16:17.802 --> 16:19.093
so when they call,

16:19.095 --> 16:21.737
I need you all to sing our praises.

16:21.740 --> 16:24.599
You mean these specific 26 praises?

16:24.601 --> 16:26.934
Karen made the list.

16:26.936 --> 16:29.195
She's very thorough.

16:29.197 --> 16:31.537
Hen, we know you.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.850
We don't need some piece
of paper to remind us

16:33.852 --> 16:35.334
of your many wonderful qualities.

16:35.337 --> 16:36.588
I appreciate that, Cap,

16:36.591 --> 16:39.091
but I'd rather you didn't improvise.

16:39.094 --> 16:40.477
The stakes are very high.

16:41.505 --> 16:43.526
I didn't know you played
a musical instrument.

16:43.529 --> 16:44.986
Mm-hmm.

16:44.988 --> 16:48.498
Bassoon. First chair.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.500
And I was damn good.

16:50.502 --> 16:51.881
Memorize, people.

16:53.522 --> 16:55.705
What's a bassoon?

17:01.304 --> 17:02.502
Mr. Blakely?

17:04.124 --> 17:05.982
Mr. Blakely.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.425
You just can't keep avoiding me.

17:07.429 --> 17:08.568
Sure I can.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.520
Now get off my property
before I call the cops.

17:10.521 --> 17:13.056
It's not your property. It's the bank's.

17:13.058 --> 17:14.558
You've defaulted on the loan.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.818
You've been defaulted.

17:16.819 --> 17:18.670
You've ignored three notices we sent,

17:18.673 --> 17:20.470
just like the one you
ignored about the upcoming

17:20.472 --> 17:21.464
foreclosure sale.

17:21.468 --> 17:23.355
Yeah, do you realize what
I could sell this place for?

17:23.357 --> 17:26.160
You can't sell it if you don't own it.

17:26.162 --> 17:28.329
We're seizing your property. Geez.

17:28.330 --> 17:29.705
This is a cash-for-keys offer.

17:29.707 --> 17:31.424
We're gonna pay your moving expenses,

17:31.426 --> 17:32.746
you sign over the deed,

17:32.749 --> 17:34.174
and then I don't have
to call the authorities

17:34.176 --> 17:35.565
and declare you a trespasser.

17:36.553 --> 17:38.264
You ever hear of the
stand-your-ground law?

17:38.267 --> 17:39.549
It's not your ground.

17:42.053 --> 17:45.088
Fine, let the authorities sort it out.

17:45.090 --> 17:47.565
911. What's your emergency?

17:47.567 --> 17:50.724
Yes, I'm calling from
636 Saddle Peak Drive.

17:50.727 --> 17:52.069
I'd like to report a trespasser

17:52.071 --> 17:53.187
on private property.

17:53.189 --> 17:54.730
Are you calling from your home, sir?

17:54.732 --> 17:56.566
Not exactly. It's nobody's home.

17:56.568 --> 17:58.234
It belongs to the bank now!

17:58.236 --> 18:00.286
The hell it does!

18:05.869 --> 18:07.201
Sir?

18:08.780 --> 18:10.538
Sir, can you hear me?

18:12.561 --> 18:13.800
I think I've done a terrible thing.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.084
You have to send somebody.

18:23.762 --> 18:26.520
I don't... I don't... I
don't know what came over me.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.723
I... look, he said he
was gonna take my house

18:28.725 --> 18:30.433
a-and I just lost it.

18:33.989 --> 18:35.271
Sir, can you hear me?

18:35.273 --> 18:37.049
- Yeah.
- Can you tell me your name?

18:37.051 --> 18:38.274
Harrison.

18:38.276 --> 18:39.734
Pulse is strong. It's rapid.

18:39.736 --> 18:41.277
Starting a line. Running it wide open.

18:41.279 --> 18:42.479
Collar and the O2.

18:42.481 --> 18:43.905
This is Captain Nash.

18:43.907 --> 18:46.666
I need an LAPD unit sent
to Saddle Peak Drive.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.501
Copy that, 118. Officer en route.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.244
Chim, can you see if
he's impaled under there?

18:50.246 --> 18:51.488
Can't tell yet, Cap.

18:51.490 --> 18:52.955
Okay, we need to get
this thing off of him.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.340
I've got this, Cap.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.193
That's close, Cap,

18:59.196 --> 19:01.422
but we still need to get
it higher to pull him out.

19:01.424 --> 19:03.833
A little higher. He's almost free.

19:03.835 --> 19:05.468
Okay, let's get ready to pry it up.

19:15.647 --> 19:18.531
All right, on three. One, two, three.

19:18.533 --> 19:19.941
Okay, pull him out.

19:22.153 --> 19:23.611
All right, he's clear.

19:23.613 --> 19:24.779
Cap, I'm feeling something here.

19:24.781 --> 19:26.372
- We gotta turn him.
- How's his spine?

19:26.374 --> 19:27.615
Lower extremities appear to be moving.

19:27.617 --> 19:28.858
Upper extremities, too.

19:28.860 --> 19:31.452
Collar's in place. Pupils are good.

19:31.454 --> 19:33.996
Let's flip him. One, two, three.

19:38.294 --> 19:39.835
I'm pretty sure all of
this is supposed to be

19:39.837 --> 19:41.241
on the inside of his body.

19:41.244 --> 19:42.722
He's been eviscerated.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.541
Seen these before. We
need to clean and irrigate.

19:44.543 --> 19:46.008
And morphine. Lots of morphine.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.044
All right, let's
double dose. Three mils.

19:48.046 --> 19:50.046
Opening can't be any bigger
than the size of a fist.

19:50.048 --> 19:51.138
We gotta keep him on his side.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.542
Bring the backboard in.

19:53.568 --> 19:55.503
Dispatch, this is Captain 118.

19:55.506 --> 19:58.186
We have a male, 30s,
partially eviscerated.

19:58.189 --> 20:00.040
His internal organs
have been pushed through

20:00.043 --> 20:02.191
a fist-sized hole in the
lower right posterior quadrant

20:02.193 --> 20:03.409
of his torso.

20:03.412 --> 20:05.060
Activate massive hemorrhage protocol

20:05.063 --> 20:06.696
and have a surgeon standing by.

20:06.698 --> 20:09.014
Copy that, dispatch.

20:09.017 --> 20:10.491
Arriving at the scene now.

20:14.706 --> 20:17.498
- Hey.
- That's your man right there.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.166
I can't believe I did this.

20:23.749 --> 20:26.507
I can't believe he did that.

20:26.509 --> 20:28.718
Am I a terrible person?

20:28.720 --> 20:31.512
I throw people out of their homes.

20:31.514 --> 20:34.107
Eh, you were just doing
your job, Harrison.

20:34.109 --> 20:36.058
I hate my job.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.762
I need to change my life.

20:38.764 --> 20:41.948
Carpe diem or whatever the hell.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.025
I think that's the morphine talking.

20:44.027 --> 20:47.620
Hey, as long as he's
talking, he's fighting.

20:47.623 --> 20:50.359
BP's falling, but he's
still in the safe zone.

20:50.362 --> 20:51.791
Gotta keep him talking.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.626
Hey, Harrison, buddy, you still with us?

20:53.628 --> 20:55.612
- Yeah.
- So, uh, tell me.

20:55.614 --> 20:57.280
If you weren't a bank guy,

20:57.282 --> 20:58.914
what do you think you'd be doing?

20:58.917 --> 21:01.602
I wanted, uh, to be a
firefighter as a kid.

21:03.563 --> 21:06.110
But now I don't think I have the guts.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.523
Okay, guys.

21:14.526 --> 21:16.253
Grossest cases to talk
about while we eat.

21:16.256 --> 21:17.467
We go first.

21:19.304 --> 21:20.987
- Albert.
- Hey, bro.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.807
Chim, your... your kid
brother is a pistol.

21:23.809 --> 21:25.642
Half-brother. What are you doing here?

21:25.644 --> 21:27.902
I wanted to see you. See where you work.

21:27.904 --> 21:29.904
Your captain said you're on
the way back from the hospital.

21:29.906 --> 21:33.333
I, uh, heard you saved a man's life.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.785
Yeah, we don't really
talk about that stuff here.

21:35.787 --> 21:37.787
You can't really show
up without calling.

21:37.789 --> 21:39.121
Ah, come on. He's no trouble.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.157
He even had time to give Cap a tutorial

21:41.159 --> 21:42.992
on how to make Korean dumplings.

21:42.995 --> 21:45.294
Um, Mandela?

21:45.296 --> 21:46.830
- Mandu.
- Mandu.

21:46.832 --> 21:48.998
I grew up watching my mother
make them every other day.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.667
Best thing is she can
freeze 'em in bulk,

21:50.669 --> 21:52.352
pop 'em in a pan, and boom, lunch.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.853
I'm gonna keep that in mind.

21:53.855 --> 21:56.172
Even better, I snack
on them at ball games.

21:56.174 --> 21:57.698
Wait, you like baseball?

21:57.701 --> 21:58.858
Very much.

21:58.860 --> 22:00.434
We should go to a game together.

22:00.436 --> 22:02.541
He's probably not
gonna be here that long.

22:02.544 --> 22:05.365
Hi. My name's Hen.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.367
I'm your brother's long-time bestie.

22:07.369 --> 22:08.773
It is a pleasure to meet you.

22:12.323 --> 22:15.333
I'm sure you probably
have a lot of questions

22:15.335 --> 22:16.283
about your brother.

22:16.286 --> 22:17.638
Yes, I do.

22:18.930 --> 22:20.697
Do you know why they call him Chimney?

22:29.057 --> 22:32.058
You don't understand that
these are crazy people.

22:32.060 --> 22:34.939
Werewolves turn with the moon
and account reps go bananas

22:34.942 --> 22:37.896
at 12:30, so I just wanna double check.

22:37.899 --> 22:41.016
Kale salad for Brian with
three different proteins.

22:41.018 --> 22:42.474
A BLT for David.

22:42.477 --> 22:45.571
Swap out the B, the L, and the T.

22:45.573 --> 22:48.224
Sweet potato fries for
Angela or she riots.

22:48.226 --> 22:50.860
Oh, my God.

22:50.862 --> 22:52.486
There he is. There he is.

22:52.488 --> 22:54.063
He's in there right now.

22:54.065 --> 22:57.734
Hey. It should be up at any second.

22:59.413 --> 23:01.571
We almost just spoke.
Like, literal words.

23:01.573 --> 23:02.906
That was insane.

23:02.908 --> 23:05.075
Okay there, Romeo. I'm hanging up now.

23:05.878 --> 23:08.069
Look, Brian knows that putting chicken,

23:08.072 --> 23:09.336
steak, and pork chops in a salad

23:09.338 --> 23:10.740
kinda defeats the point, right?

23:10.743 --> 23:12.265
Do you think he even knows my name?

23:15.103 --> 23:17.261
Order for Justin.

23:18.842 --> 23:21.878
To go, for Justin.

23:23.203 --> 23:25.352
There. Now there can be no doubt.

23:25.354 --> 23:26.735
He definitely knows your name.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.646
That was shameful and embarrassing.

23:28.649 --> 23:30.281
Also if you can mix the Thousand Island

23:30.284 --> 23:31.546
and the ranch together, that'd be great.

23:31.548 --> 23:33.736
My God, man. Just talk to him.

23:33.738 --> 23:35.438
That would involve me
saying words to his face.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.440
You have been looking at
him like you were starving

23:37.442 --> 23:39.292
and he was lunch for a year now.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.744
You adjusted your schedule to match his.

23:41.746 --> 23:43.279
You are one order of boiled bunny

23:43.281 --> 23:45.203
away from being a stalker.

23:45.206 --> 23:48.250
- Find the words.
- Oh, I've got the words.

23:48.252 --> 23:50.746
Just not the spine.

23:52.048 --> 23:54.958
You wrote a love note. On a menu.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.126
It's right there, under sandwiches.

23:57.128 --> 23:59.530
"No man is an island,

23:59.533 --> 24:03.057
but two men together
can share the world."

24:03.059 --> 24:04.480
That's a bit lyrical, sure,

24:04.483 --> 24:06.636
but it really opens
up in the later pages.

24:06.638 --> 24:07.895
Why, what would you say?

24:07.897 --> 24:10.306
"Hi, I'm Justin. Wanna hook up?"

24:10.308 --> 24:12.399
Shakespearian.

24:18.316 --> 24:21.116
Look, I don't wanna break
the heartbreak to you,

24:21.118 --> 24:24.337
but whatever you gotta say, say it fast.

24:24.339 --> 24:26.005
He got a job across town.

24:26.007 --> 24:29.175
After tomorrow he's taking
his Panini elsewhere.

24:29.177 --> 24:31.449
Order for Miles. To-go for Miles.

24:33.815 --> 24:35.756
Now or never, kid.

24:35.758 --> 24:37.132
Seize the day.

24:47.846 --> 24:49.028
Whoa!

24:54.127 --> 24:55.460
Oh, my God.

24:56.860 --> 24:58.163
_

24:58.372 --> 25:01.457
_

25:01.458 --> 25:04.432
_

25:04.435 --> 25:06.327
LAFD coming through.

25:06.330 --> 25:09.139
Sir, can you tell us what happened?

25:09.142 --> 25:10.511
Can you speak?

25:10.514 --> 25:12.368
These two construction guys,
they... they cut him off.

25:12.370 --> 25:13.411
He ran right into a metal pole

25:13.413 --> 25:15.115
and caught him in the neck, I think.

25:15.118 --> 25:16.129
Or the throat.

25:16.132 --> 25:18.891
Possible impact with the windpipe.

25:18.893 --> 25:21.894
There could be tracheal,
maybe esophageal damage.

25:21.896 --> 25:24.471
Wind pipe's constricted,
but otherwise clear.

25:24.474 --> 25:25.947
We'll put him on the O2.

25:25.950 --> 25:28.325
Pupillary response is
normal. Nothing neurological.

25:28.328 --> 25:30.019
Let's put him in a brace
in case he hit his head

25:30.021 --> 25:31.721
on his way down. Do you know his name?

25:31.723 --> 25:34.907
Yeah, his name's Justin.

25:34.909 --> 25:37.026
J-Justin McAvoy, I think.

25:37.028 --> 25:38.911
Uh, he works over at MetroTech.

25:38.914 --> 25:41.734
I don't know if this matters,
but he may have a nut allergy.

25:41.737 --> 25:44.567
He orders the same thing
every day except no almonds.

25:44.569 --> 25:46.069
I think he wants to talk.

25:46.071 --> 25:47.695
What's he trying to say?

25:47.697 --> 25:49.589
"No man is an island,

25:49.591 --> 25:52.758
but two men together
can share the world.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.029
Uh, hi, I'm Justin."

25:56.676 --> 25:58.097
God, this is so stupid.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.174
Uh, "I don't know if you noticed me

26:00.176 --> 26:01.383
these last few months.

26:01.385 --> 26:04.347
I work in an office getting lunches

26:04.350 --> 26:07.834
and making copies so I
never do feel very seen,

26:07.837 --> 26:09.682
but I have seen you.

26:09.685 --> 26:11.726
How kind you are to people..."

26:11.729 --> 26:12.945
I think we're caught in the middle

26:12.947 --> 26:15.114
of some weird Cyrano thing.

26:15.116 --> 26:17.283
"I don't always have
the courage to speak,

26:17.285 --> 26:20.361
but some days I'm more afraid not to.

26:20.363 --> 26:22.939
So I've written it
down to say it clearly

26:22.941 --> 26:24.790
and for myself."

26:24.792 --> 26:26.700
Well, for himself,

26:26.702 --> 26:28.945
because I would never, ever do this,

26:28.947 --> 26:30.913
but... but he would,

26:30.915 --> 26:34.249
and he's way nicer
than I am. Very single.

26:34.251 --> 26:35.584
Totally datable.

26:35.586 --> 26:37.286
That's not in the... in the note.

26:37.288 --> 26:38.879
I'm just improvising.

26:38.881 --> 26:42.861
Uh, "So if the image of a nervous intern

26:42.864 --> 26:45.093
reading poetry on the
back of a lunch menu

26:45.096 --> 26:46.963
doesn't turn you off,

26:46.965 --> 26:49.723
I only have one question."

26:49.725 --> 26:51.172
- Kill...
- You trying to say?

26:51.174 --> 26:52.726
What'd he say?

26:54.787 --> 26:57.197
Would you like to ride in the
back of the ambulance with him?

26:59.811 --> 27:01.068
Yes.

27:16.344 --> 27:18.010
23 messages?

27:18.012 --> 27:20.254
I've heard more from my
father in the past week

27:20.256 --> 27:21.434
than the entirety of my life,

27:21.437 --> 27:23.166
and not one of these
messages is about me.

27:23.168 --> 27:24.640
Okay, but tonight is about you,

27:24.643 --> 27:26.427
so put your phone away and let's focus

27:26.429 --> 27:27.552
on the birthday boy.

27:27.555 --> 27:28.743
Okay, I'm sorry.

27:28.746 --> 27:31.673
I'm just so tired of talking
about Albert, Albert, Albert.

27:31.676 --> 27:34.143
Albert.

27:34.145 --> 27:35.796
♪ You take the weight off of me ♪

27:35.799 --> 27:37.697
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

27:37.699 --> 27:42.109
♪ Ooh nobody knows it ♪

27:43.988 --> 27:45.398
Hit it, Albert!

27:46.657 --> 27:47.873
All right.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.660
I get it, you know?

27:51.662 --> 27:53.287
Sometimes you gotta put a little mileage

27:53.289 --> 27:54.746
between yourself and home

27:54.749 --> 27:57.383
so you figure out what
you want and who you are.

27:57.385 --> 27:58.718
Hell, if I had enlisted,

27:58.720 --> 28:00.369
I'd still be working with my pops.

28:00.371 --> 28:03.206
Eddie, don't encourage
him to go off to war.

28:03.208 --> 28:05.901
There is as much virtue
to the noble warrior

28:05.904 --> 28:08.204
as there is to the most
enlightened of scholars.

28:08.207 --> 28:10.666
That. What he said.

28:10.669 --> 28:12.638
Listen, everyone has their path.

28:12.641 --> 28:15.176
You just do you, Albert.

28:15.178 --> 28:16.351
I will.

28:16.353 --> 28:17.937
I will do me.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.936
Yeah, might wanna watch how
you phrase that one, buddy.

28:20.939 --> 28:23.074
I just need a little
of my brother's courage.

28:25.029 --> 28:27.413
You know, he did not let
father dictate his life.

28:27.415 --> 28:30.233
He took a stand, got out.

28:30.235 --> 28:32.141
Came to America to follow his dreams.

28:35.206 --> 28:36.864
There was no stand.

28:38.593 --> 28:42.411
I didn't get out. I was left behind.

28:42.413 --> 28:43.763
Chim.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.599
See, most of my life,

28:46.601 --> 28:48.584
all I wanted was for him to see me,

28:48.586 --> 28:49.944
to be proud of me,

28:49.947 --> 28:52.046
be proud to call me his son,

28:52.048 --> 28:54.348
but no matter what I did,

28:54.350 --> 28:55.711
I was always invisible.

28:57.704 --> 29:02.123
Because you are the only
son that he cares about.

29:03.691 --> 29:05.691
You have all his attention,

29:05.694 --> 29:07.528
all his love,

29:07.530 --> 29:09.738
and you just walked away from it all,

29:09.741 --> 29:12.883
which I guess is easy for
you because you've never had

29:12.886 --> 29:14.243
to work for it.

29:14.245 --> 29:17.871
No, everybody...

29:17.873 --> 29:22.785
everybody loves Albert.

29:22.787 --> 29:25.254
This entire table is proof of that.

29:25.256 --> 29:27.906
You do not know what my
life was like at home.

29:29.093 --> 29:33.086
I know you have always had a family,

29:33.089 --> 29:37.585
and I have always been
trying to piece one together.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.229
Well, these people are all that I have.

29:42.231 --> 29:43.772
You don't get to take them, too.

29:44.821 --> 29:46.809
I do not wish to take
anything from you, Howard.

29:46.811 --> 29:47.884
I'm your brother.

29:47.887 --> 29:50.956
You are not my brother.

29:53.183 --> 29:57.743
I had a brother. His name was Kevin.

29:57.746 --> 29:59.989
And he died.

29:59.991 --> 30:01.433
Do you see, Albert?

30:01.436 --> 30:06.116
You didn't come to me because
you wanted to be my brother.

30:06.119 --> 30:10.299
You came to me because you
needed something from me.

30:14.430 --> 30:16.522
- Come on.
- Hey... hey, Albert!

30:19.360 --> 30:22.354
I know. I suck.

30:29.411 --> 30:32.247
Yeah, thanks, Buck. I'll tell him.

30:32.250 --> 30:33.798
Is Albert okay?

30:34.735 --> 30:37.301
Yeah, Buck's gonna let him
stay with him for the night.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.379
I'm more worried about you right now.

30:40.381 --> 30:42.122
What was all that?

30:43.667 --> 30:45.551
Me working out my childhood trauma

30:45.553 --> 30:47.036
on some kid who doesn't deserve it?

30:47.038 --> 30:48.504
Oh, no, that part I got.

30:49.983 --> 30:53.467
But the part about everyone
liking Albert more than you?

30:53.469 --> 30:55.969
- That is just crazy.
- My father does.

30:58.474 --> 30:59.928
We were never close.

31:00.994 --> 31:02.809
Even when we lived in the same house,

31:02.811 --> 31:04.478
he was always at a distance,

31:04.480 --> 31:07.056
and I spent years trying
to bridge that gap,

31:07.058 --> 31:11.727
and finally I gave up.

31:11.729 --> 31:16.415
I told myself he just wasn't
interested in being a father.

31:16.417 --> 31:19.068
Turns out he just wasn't interested

31:19.070 --> 31:21.536
in being a father to me.

31:24.166 --> 31:27.410
I don't know what his
relationship is with Albert.

31:27.412 --> 31:29.412
Neither do you.

31:29.414 --> 31:31.004
I know that there is one.

31:31.006 --> 31:32.480
It can't be a good one.

31:32.483 --> 31:34.250
Otherwise he wouldn't have
shown up on your doorstep

31:34.252 --> 31:36.551
the way that he did.

31:36.553 --> 31:38.512
Trust me. I know.

31:38.514 --> 31:39.554
That's different, Maddie.

31:39.556 --> 31:40.923
You were running from your husband.

31:40.925 --> 31:42.828
Yeah, but I ran to my brother.

31:44.067 --> 31:46.153
He was the one person I could count on.

31:48.486 --> 31:51.170
Look, my mom and dad aren't bad people.

31:51.173 --> 31:55.550
They're just bad parents.

31:55.553 --> 31:57.364
And the mistakes that they made with me,

31:57.366 --> 31:58.607
they made them with Buck, too.

32:07.376 --> 32:10.286
Hey, this is a surprise.

32:10.288 --> 32:11.620
What are you doing here?

32:11.622 --> 32:13.880
I didn't think I needed a reason.

32:13.882 --> 32:16.040
Yeah, but you usually have one.

32:18.887 --> 32:20.220
I knew it.

32:20.222 --> 32:21.630
I knew you were lying.

32:21.632 --> 32:23.557
May, this... it's
just... this isn't, uh...

32:23.559 --> 32:25.500
You're updating your will.

32:25.503 --> 32:27.060
People do that when they're dying.

32:27.062 --> 32:29.656
And they also do it when
they have two children

32:29.659 --> 32:32.600
and are about to undergo
major surgery so...

32:32.609 --> 32:34.977
A risky surgery.

32:34.979 --> 32:36.363
I looked it up.

32:38.449 --> 32:40.115
Okay.

32:40.117 --> 32:41.360
Uh...

32:45.431 --> 32:48.182
You're right. Okay, sit down.

32:53.529 --> 32:54.953
It is risky.

32:56.867 --> 32:58.609
And I don't know what's gonna happen

32:58.612 --> 33:03.338
and... and there are no guarantees here.

33:03.341 --> 33:05.140
But without it...

33:07.603 --> 33:10.028
I can be dead in a year.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.481
So then why didn't you tell us?

33:12.483 --> 33:14.041
Why did you lie to me and Harry?

33:15.870 --> 33:17.703
I didn't wanna scare you.

33:17.705 --> 33:19.780
Are you scared?

33:25.863 --> 33:27.621
Yeah.

33:31.960 --> 33:34.461
I'm scared of dying.

33:36.390 --> 33:38.632
I'm scared of living and being worse off

33:38.634 --> 33:42.135
than I am now.

33:42.137 --> 33:44.563
And most of all,

33:44.565 --> 33:46.485
I am terrified...

33:49.070 --> 33:51.245
Of not seeing you and Harry...

33:53.166 --> 33:56.024
That's what... that...
that's why I'm doing this,

33:56.026 --> 33:58.336
is to make sure that you
two are taken care of...

33:58.339 --> 34:01.230
Stop. Stop doing that.

34:01.232 --> 34:06.251
Planning for your death,
you can't think like that.

34:06.253 --> 34:07.969
You still have options,

34:07.972 --> 34:10.475
and as long as you have
options and have us...

34:12.844 --> 34:14.312
There's still hope.

34:16.295 --> 34:19.505
When did you grow up on me?

34:19.507 --> 34:20.826
Hmm?

34:22.007 --> 34:23.342
I love you.

34:23.344 --> 34:24.753
I love you, too, Dad.

34:24.755 --> 34:27.848
Oh, May, I love you
with all my heart, baby.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.206
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:39.402 --> 34:42.286
Um, thanks for letting
Albert sleep here.

34:42.289 --> 34:43.789
I appreciate it.

34:43.791 --> 34:45.407
Of course.

34:45.409 --> 34:46.638
He's your brother.

34:52.132 --> 34:55.542
Okay, um, I'm gonna go take a shower.

34:55.543 --> 34:57.150
Coffee on the counter.

35:06.388 --> 35:08.631
I'm sorry about last
night, the things I said.

35:08.633 --> 35:10.466
You were right.

35:10.468 --> 35:12.190
We don't know each other.

35:12.193 --> 35:14.895
It was presumptuous of me
to show up on your doorstep.

35:14.897 --> 35:17.902
I apologize. I'll pack my stuff.

35:20.337 --> 35:23.372
- You headed to Seoul?
- No.

35:23.375 --> 35:25.038
There's nothing for me there.

35:26.116 --> 35:28.014
What about your parents?

35:28.017 --> 35:32.245
My mother says she can't wait
to visit me here in California.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.824
And Pop?

35:35.826 --> 35:39.056
He will not speak to me until
I am back where I belong.

35:42.731 --> 35:45.390
Did he ever tell you why
I don't live with you guys?

35:49.139 --> 35:50.863
It's a funny story, if you wanna...

35:52.225 --> 35:53.367
So...

35:55.196 --> 35:59.327
Pop got relocated here
when I was maybe five.

36:00.609 --> 36:03.519
Gig was supposed to last two years.

36:03.521 --> 36:05.466
We stayed six.

36:07.133 --> 36:09.208
When it came time to go back to Korea...

36:11.362 --> 36:12.657
My ma didn't wanna go.

36:13.163 --> 36:15.155
She loved it here,

36:15.157 --> 36:18.717
and she wanted to stay, and
I wanted to stay with her.

36:18.719 --> 36:21.127
Sure you can imagine how that went over.

36:21.129 --> 36:23.539
Like a metal balloon.

36:23.541 --> 36:25.562
Lead balloon, but yes.

36:27.320 --> 36:29.845
So he went back to Korea without us.

36:29.848 --> 36:31.897
Guess he figured she'd
come to her senses.

36:31.899 --> 36:34.975
- But she didn't?
- No.

36:34.977 --> 36:36.472
Instead she got sick.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.688
Cancer.

36:39.690 --> 36:42.224
She fought like hell
for a few years and...

36:43.777 --> 36:47.153
Eventually she couldn't fight anymore.

36:47.155 --> 36:50.490
She died a couple weeks
before my 15th birthday.

36:52.869 --> 36:54.327
I'm sorry, Howie.

36:56.191 --> 36:58.164
You know I was always so jealous of you.

36:59.977 --> 37:02.502
Your mom would e-mail me
these pictures sometimes

37:02.504 --> 37:07.057
and I would just think,
"Man, that kid is so lucky."

37:07.059 --> 37:08.717
To have a family, you know?

37:08.719 --> 37:10.861
I think I like your family better.

37:12.222 --> 37:14.360
Maddie, Buck,

37:14.363 --> 37:15.934
the other firefighters, and...

37:16.989 --> 37:18.632
It was nice getting to know them.

37:19.947 --> 37:22.264
Good.

37:22.266 --> 37:25.734
Because fair warning...
they're around a lot.

37:25.736 --> 37:27.694
Hope you can handle that.

37:27.696 --> 37:29.270
Does that mean I can stay?

37:30.958 --> 37:33.366
Of course.

37:33.368 --> 37:35.386
You're my brother.

37:51.053 --> 37:53.053
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, son.

37:53.055 --> 37:56.197
These are adult iced teas
for me and your mother.

37:57.318 --> 37:59.100
Are you sure you should be drinking

37:59.102 --> 38:01.041
when you're going into surgery tomorrow?

38:01.044 --> 38:03.639
Well, actually, I'm not.

38:03.641 --> 38:05.785
Oh, did they postpone it?

38:05.788 --> 38:08.042
No, I cancelled it.

38:08.045 --> 38:09.729
What do you mean, you cancelled it?

38:11.239 --> 38:13.882
Did, uh, something change?

38:14.760 --> 38:15.926
Yes.

38:17.671 --> 38:19.004
My perspective.

38:19.006 --> 38:21.323
Dad, that wasn't what I meant.

38:21.325 --> 38:23.675
No, I know. I know.

38:23.677 --> 38:25.251
But you made me think about things

38:25.253 --> 38:28.296
in a way that I haven't
in a very long time.

38:28.298 --> 38:31.935
You know, I was so focused on my death,

38:31.938 --> 38:36.096
but now I wanna be focused
on my life and what I have.

38:36.098 --> 38:38.640
You know, which is all of you.

38:38.642 --> 38:40.732
Did your doctor say this was okay?

38:40.735 --> 38:44.363
My doctor doesn't get to decide
how I live my life... I do.

38:44.365 --> 38:46.568
So what happens if you
don't get the surgery?

38:46.571 --> 38:48.108
- He'll die.
- Hey.

38:48.110 --> 38:49.585
Now, we don't know that.

38:50.612 --> 38:53.021
Okay, you guys, listen.

38:53.023 --> 38:56.024
I'm not giving up, okay?

38:56.026 --> 38:59.194
I'm gonna keep fighting. I just...

38:59.196 --> 39:01.621
I don't know what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

39:01.623 --> 39:06.034
But what I do know is all that we have

39:06.036 --> 39:07.337
is today.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.809
I d... I don't know
where this is coming from.

39:13.727 --> 39:16.845
My heart, Athena.

39:16.847 --> 39:20.399
It is coming from my heart.

39:28.692 --> 39:30.044
Come here.

39:30.047 --> 39:32.318
You ever think it's weird
we spend 50-something hours

39:32.320 --> 39:35.363
a week together and still hang out?

39:35.365 --> 39:37.749
No. What's that saying?

39:37.751 --> 39:39.492
You got the family you're born into

39:39.494 --> 39:40.787
and the one you choose?

39:41.922 --> 39:44.873
Well, that's what the 118
is. The family we chose.

39:50.984 --> 39:52.097
No.

39:52.099 --> 39:54.571
Uh, not gonna put out
the cookies I brought?

39:54.574 --> 39:55.991
It's not time for dessert,

39:55.994 --> 39:58.203
and why are you acting
like you made them yourself?

39:58.206 --> 40:00.221
I drove myself to go buy them.

40:00.223 --> 40:02.257
Look, I... I don't really get why

40:02.259 --> 40:03.592
I had to bring something anyway.

40:03.594 --> 40:04.993
You practically shamed me into it.

40:04.996 --> 40:06.186
Because it's what you do.

40:06.188 --> 40:07.729
When someone invites you to their house,

40:07.731 --> 40:09.097
you don't show up empty-handed.

40:09.099 --> 40:12.233
Uh, this is Eddie's house.
I'm not really a guest.

40:12.235 --> 40:14.119
Okay, I was trying to
save you from yourself,

40:14.121 --> 40:15.309
like always.

40:15.312 --> 40:16.905
Well, thanks.

40:16.907 --> 40:19.791
You are a good sister.

40:19.793 --> 40:21.201
I'm lucky to have you.

40:21.203 --> 40:22.606
We're lucky to have each other.

40:23.668 --> 40:25.079
All right, now help me carry this.

40:25.081 --> 40:26.131
Yes, ma'am.

40:29.377 --> 40:31.753
He really is so sweet.

40:31.755 --> 40:33.972
It's amazing he turned
out the way he did,

40:33.974 --> 40:36.308
especially after all the things
you told me about your father.

40:36.310 --> 40:40.146
Well, who I am now has
nothing to do with my father.

40:40.149 --> 40:42.222
I'm sorry he wasn't there for you.

40:42.224 --> 40:44.557
- You deserved better.
- You know what?

40:44.559 --> 40:46.726
I had better.

40:46.728 --> 40:48.394
Not sure I realized it until now,

40:48.396 --> 40:51.731
but my mom, Kevin's family,

40:51.733 --> 40:54.476
the Lees,

40:54.479 --> 40:56.212
and now all of you.

40:57.578 --> 40:58.997
I'm a pretty lucky guy.

41:03.003 --> 41:04.997
Are we ready for this?

41:05.000 --> 41:06.838
You're asking this now?

41:06.840 --> 41:10.659
After three months of paperwork

41:10.661 --> 41:13.586
and home inspections
and background checks,

41:13.588 --> 41:16.596
it's a little late for cold feet, Karen.

41:16.599 --> 41:19.133
Oh, my feet aren't the problem.

41:19.135 --> 41:21.336
The pounding in my chest might be.

41:21.338 --> 41:24.339
Were we ready with Denny?

41:24.341 --> 41:25.951
Hell no.

41:25.954 --> 41:28.426
Exactly.

41:28.429 --> 41:31.771
Sometimes you just gotta
take a leap of faith.

41:31.773 --> 41:33.348
Together.

41:41.358 --> 41:44.526
This is Nia.

41:44.528 --> 41:46.995
She's your new foster.

41:56.339 --> 41:58.557
- Hi, am I late?
- Right on time.

41:58.559 --> 42:00.578
Wow, the table looks so nice.

42:00.581 --> 42:03.562
Um, where did you hide
all of Albert's stuff?

42:03.564 --> 42:06.014
Let's just say you should
avoid opening any closet doors

42:06.016 --> 42:07.215
while they are here.

42:07.217 --> 42:09.809
Chim, do I look okay?

42:09.811 --> 42:11.519
I changed, like, four times.

42:11.521 --> 42:13.071
Honestly, I just couldn't decide.

42:13.073 --> 42:14.856
No, you look better than okay.

42:14.858 --> 42:16.475
You look beautiful.

42:16.478 --> 42:18.226
I don't know why you're so nervous.

42:18.228 --> 42:19.561
I'm the one who should be nervous.

42:19.563 --> 42:20.896
Because I'm meeting your parents,

42:20.898 --> 42:21.955
more or less.

42:21.958 --> 42:23.352
I mean, what if they don't like me?

42:26.737 --> 42:28.036
They're gonna love you.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.909
Howard.

42:39.099 --> 42:41.049
Mr. Lee.

42:41.051 --> 42:42.603
It's good to see you, Howard.

42:42.606 --> 42:44.102
It's good to see you, too.

42:44.104 --> 42:46.104
- You must be Maddie.
- Yes.

42:46.106 --> 42:49.682
Maddie, I want you to
meet Mr. and Mrs. Lee.

42:49.684 --> 42:51.702
The people who helped raise me.
