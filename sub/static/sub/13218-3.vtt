01:20.500 --> 01:22.585
[Taystee exhales heavily]

01:22.668 --> 01:24.962
How are we supposed to clean the floors

01:25.045 --> 01:29.049
with nonstop bitches
tracking their shit through?

01:29.134 --> 01:31.511
[Suzanne] We are like
he whom the gods have condemned

01:31.594 --> 01:36.224
to push the boulder up the hill
only to watch it roll back down.

01:36.307 --> 01:37.392
Oh, right, right, right, right.

01:37.475 --> 01:41.020
And then he has to cut his arm off
to get out from underneath it.

01:41.103 --> 01:43.773
What is that guy's name?
Oh, James Franco!

01:43.856 --> 01:45.065
Sisyphus.

01:45.150 --> 01:46.859
I did hear that rumor.

01:46.942 --> 01:50.280
You know those Hollywood types,
they will stick it in any warm hole.

01:50.363 --> 01:53.658
Well, you don't have to be from Hollywood
to wanna put it in a warm place.

01:53.741 --> 01:54.784
It's called having a dick.

01:54.867 --> 01:56.244
No, my Vinnie would never.

01:56.327 --> 02:01.081
Well, maybe not in a man-hole,
but you away a long time.

02:01.166 --> 02:05.211
He could be getting his M&M
melting in some ho's mouth

02:05.295 --> 02:06.671
and not in his hand.
[chuckles]

02:06.754 --> 02:11.091
No. No, that's never gonna happen
because we're talking sexy on the phone,

02:11.176 --> 02:14.094
like, 24/7, and I mean real sexy.

02:14.179 --> 02:15.555
And I give very good phone.

02:15.638 --> 02:18.683
Are we talking about peanut M&M's
or regular?

02:18.766 --> 02:20.143
[both laughing]

[man on PA]
<i>Inmate Jefferson, Tasha Jefferson,</i>

02:23.771 --> 02:25.606

<i>Inmate Tasha Jefferson</i>
<i>to the warden's office.</i>

02:28.067 --> 02:31.028
<i>Who's Tasha Jefferson?</i>
<i>Oh, Taystee?</i>

02:31.111 --> 02:32.613
<i>Taystee, go to the warden's office.</i>

02:32.697 --> 02:33.906
We have a warden?

02:33.989 --> 02:37.117
-Your name's Tasha?
-What is this about?

02:39.495 --> 02:43.749
The main thing is answering the phones
and organizational stuff.

02:44.917 --> 02:46.377
General assisting.

02:48.421 --> 02:50.631
I don't know.
I've never had an assistant before.

02:50.715 --> 02:52.049
We will figure it out together.

02:52.132 --> 02:54.552
And you swear this is legit?

02:54.635 --> 02:56.011
'Cause I seen <i>Shawshank</i>

02:56.095 --> 02:59.682
and I don't wanna go to Seg
because I did your taxes too good.

02:59.765 --> 03:00.891
I guarantee you,

03:00.975 --> 03:03.728
you will never see anything
with my social security number on it.

03:03.811 --> 03:05.104
Never say never.

03:05.187 --> 03:06.689
You work for MCC.

03:06.772 --> 03:09.859
Maybe one day you realize
you need food stamps

03:09.942 --> 03:11.611
and you don't know
how to fill out the forms.

03:11.694 --> 03:12.820
Well, I'm your girl.

03:12.903 --> 03:15.656
I can walk you through it,
but I'm gonna need them digits.

03:15.740 --> 03:18.659
However...
[whispers] I'm a vault.

03:18.743 --> 03:20.703
I don't say nothing.

03:20.786 --> 03:24.457
And I ain't never crawling through
a tunnel of piss and dookie, so rest easy.

03:24.540 --> 03:28.836
Okay. As of now, you're off janitorial
and you're with me.

03:28.919 --> 03:30.463
Praise Jesus.

03:30.546 --> 03:32.798
Every day.
When I'm working, you're working.

03:32.882 --> 03:35.050
Is this 'cause I won at job fair?

03:36.135 --> 03:38.388
-Sure.
-[scoffs] I told them bitches.

03:38.471 --> 03:41.932
Take a clipboard,
write things down, look busy.

03:43.226 --> 03:45.395
Outside.

03:48.231 --> 03:50.483
Alert! Alert! Alert!

03:50.566 --> 03:52.860
-What?
-Mmm!

03:55.195 --> 03:57.615
[Alex] What?
Healy's just showing her around.

03:57.698 --> 04:00.701
Frieda's over there.
It's all good.

04:00.785 --> 04:04.872
Why does she get some special garden tour
like some fancy Shiba Inu?

04:04.955 --> 04:08.042
[scoffs] She's a celebrity, okay?

04:08.125 --> 04:09.502
Fucking relax.

04:10.461 --> 04:12.212
Uh... [stammering]

04:12.297 --> 04:16.091
Not okay.
Not... Not really relaxed.

04:16.175 --> 04:18.969
I think you are way too relaxed...

04:19.053 --> 04:22.557
to be in this big, brown
shit-uation that we're in!

04:22.640 --> 04:24.767
Lolly, believe me.

04:24.850 --> 04:28.729
My insides have completely liquefied
and I wanna vomit all the time...

04:28.813 --> 04:33.108
but I have chosen to keep my voice low
and appear calm.

04:33.192 --> 04:34.569
You have to do the same.

04:34.652 --> 04:37.738
-[exhales deeply] I can't.
-You have to.

04:37.822 --> 04:40.074
-Look at me. You...
-[inhales sharply]

04:40.157 --> 04:42.660
Listen. You have to.

04:42.743 --> 04:48.624
Change the record in your head.
Play, "He was a bad man.

04:48.708 --> 04:51.336
We did what we had to do
and we did it well.

04:51.419 --> 04:52.712
So now it's through."

04:52.795 --> 04:55.172
It's a mantra.
Say it.

04:56.341 --> 04:58.801
"We did what we had to do
and we did it well."

05:00.219 --> 05:03.180
You forgot the bad man part.
And the end.

05:03.848 --> 05:05.600
But that's the idea.

05:05.683 --> 05:10.145
So whenever you're feeling worried,
whenever your thoughts start to... wander,

05:10.229 --> 05:13.566
just bring them back to the mantra...
and then come and find me.

05:13.649 --> 05:14.859
Okay?

05:15.901 --> 05:18.863
"He was a bad man
who did bad things well,

05:18.946 --> 05:20.155
and now he's gone."

05:20.239 --> 05:21.491
Got it!

05:21.574 --> 05:25.035
"He was a bad man,
now he's gone from the well..."

05:26.203 --> 05:29.457
[Judy] Now that is one happy tomato.
[chuckles]

05:29.540 --> 05:31.291
I hope I do as well here.

05:31.376 --> 05:33.210
-Hey, there's a good idea.
-Hmm.

05:33.293 --> 05:35.630
Maybe we should fertilize our women, too.

05:35.713 --> 05:38.383
-[both chuckle]
-I do love your good intentions.

05:38.466 --> 05:41.343
-[Maureen] Hey, Judy.
-Hey.

05:41.427 --> 05:42.470
Hi.

05:44.389 --> 05:45.640
You've got quite a following.

05:45.723 --> 05:48.393
Yeah, I was hoping the novelty
would wear off soon.

05:48.476 --> 05:51.020
Might have to hide myself in that corn.
[chuckles]

05:51.103 --> 05:54.189
Oh, look, how beautiful!

05:54.273 --> 05:55.357
Help yourself.

05:55.441 --> 05:56.901
Oh! All right.

05:58.486 --> 06:00.112
[Red] Oh, really?

06:00.195 --> 06:02.698
Free-for-all on the produce now, huh?

06:02.782 --> 06:04.617
Regardless of who's in the club.

06:04.700 --> 06:08.788
Who's worked the soil, pulled the weeds,
tended the seedlings.

06:08.871 --> 06:10.330
Is that the new policy?

06:10.415 --> 06:13.626
-This is Judy King.
-Oh, I know who she is.

06:13.709 --> 06:17.588
I've seen her... daytime TV program.

06:17.672 --> 06:20.215
But we haven't had the pleasure.

06:20.299 --> 06:23.218
Mrs. King is going to be
joining your club, Red.

06:24.011 --> 06:25.638
So I'll leave you to it.

06:25.721 --> 06:27.640
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

06:27.723 --> 06:30.225
I'm sure you'll find a lot in common.

06:30.309 --> 06:32.102
Hair and...

06:32.186 --> 06:33.228
accents.

06:34.605 --> 06:37.149
You know, my daddy used to call me "Red."
[laughs]

06:37.232 --> 06:39.359
Really? That's sweet.
[chuckles]

06:40.235 --> 06:44.865
My papa called me <i>solnyshko.</i>
It means little sun.

06:44.949 --> 06:48.494
But I've grown bigger and hotter
since then, and he's dead.

06:49.745 --> 06:53.332
So what are you going to do with that ear,
now that you've picked it?

06:53.415 --> 06:56.836
Well, I guess that depends on
what else I can find around here.

06:56.919 --> 07:00.339
I could do a Southern fried corn,
a dilled corn shooter,

07:00.422 --> 07:02.174
Taiwanese-style street corn.

07:02.257 --> 07:03.801
Listen to fancy pants.

07:03.884 --> 07:05.886
I could shove it up your ass.

07:05.970 --> 07:08.598
Hmm, I'm not so big on ass play.

07:08.681 --> 07:11.976
What do you suggest I do, Miss Red?

07:13.060 --> 07:14.812
I'm thinking.

07:19.316 --> 07:21.527
-Can I have some seeds?
-[blowing]

07:21.611 --> 07:24.655
You bought Ovaltine.
Reap what you sow.

07:24.739 --> 07:26.031
Ovaltine's got vitamins.

07:26.115 --> 07:29.619
I'll trade you Ovaltine powder later
for some seeds now. I'm good for it.

07:29.702 --> 07:31.078
No deal.

07:31.662 --> 07:34.457
You'll regret it. That's some
malty goodness you're passing up.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.085
Excuse me?

07:38.168 --> 07:42.297
You knew going into this I had bad knees.
My feet are killing me.

07:42.381 --> 07:43.674
We are putting out a vibe.

07:43.758 --> 07:46.343
If you are sitting and/or
eating my seeds, no vibe.

07:46.426 --> 07:50.347
Right now, there is no vibe.
See? Look at this.

07:51.056 --> 07:54.351
-All of a sudden, I'm approachable.
-Picking up or dropping off?

07:55.269 --> 07:57.271
Neither. We're out.

07:57.354 --> 07:58.981
I gave you guys new ones yesterday.

08:00.315 --> 08:02.777
We're hanging up our lacy intimates.

08:02.860 --> 08:04.987
If this is because of the money
Stella took, I'm good for it.

08:05.070 --> 08:06.071
I'll pay you back.

08:06.989 --> 08:10.868
It's not worth it anymore.
We're smelling the beginning of the end.

08:10.951 --> 08:12.828
You and all your posturing,

08:12.912 --> 08:15.498
shipping the kangaroo down the hill.
[tutting]

08:15.581 --> 08:20.085
It's starting to feel dangerous.
You've even got a heavy on the payroll.

08:20.169 --> 08:21.796
Ha! I see what you did there.

08:21.879 --> 08:24.507
-"Heavy."
-Not on purpose.

08:25.090 --> 08:27.342
Fine, jump ship like rats.

08:27.426 --> 08:29.554
And I'm not talking about
the Disney-Pixar kind.

08:29.637 --> 08:32.014
I was gonna fire one of you anyway,
but I'm not gonna say which one.

08:32.097 --> 08:33.182
Chew on that.

08:34.850 --> 08:37.436
We're gonna take a walk on the track,
you wanna join us, kahuna?

08:37.520 --> 08:39.270
No, she does not.
She's got bad knees.

08:39.354 --> 08:40.690
[sighs]

08:40.773 --> 08:41.899
Enjoy sweating for free.

08:41.982 --> 08:45.402
I expect all my undies still in
your possession returned posthaste.

08:46.195 --> 08:48.488
[chuckling] "Posthaste"?
That's nuts.

08:50.115 --> 08:52.326
-Do you have something to say?
-Sure.

08:53.953 --> 08:56.371
But I'll wait till I'm with my friends.

08:57.873 --> 09:00.209
Off the backboard.
[clicking and grunts]

09:01.168 --> 09:02.920
-[Poussey] Oh!
-[Brook laughs]

09:03.003 --> 09:06.090
Short, black and bad at basketball.

09:06.173 --> 09:10.886
-Subverting expectations since 1990.
-Oh, it's okay.

09:10.970 --> 09:14.181
Litchfield's latest lesbos,
in fun-size.

09:14.765 --> 09:16.433
Look, how much longer do you think

09:16.516 --> 09:18.603
the world's longest game of Horse
is gonna go on?

09:18.686 --> 09:20.855
[exhales deeply]
She ain't a lesbian.

09:20.938 --> 09:22.439
I see.

09:22.522 --> 09:25.359
Testing the waters
before diving in face-first?

09:25.442 --> 09:27.862
I'm attracted to people, not genders.

09:27.945 --> 09:31.406
Well, aren't you special.

09:31.490 --> 09:34.451
Tell you what, why don't you use
some of that sexual fluidity

09:34.534 --> 09:37.079
to slide off the court
so the real men can play?

09:37.830 --> 09:39.749
[scoffs] Come on.

09:39.832 --> 09:43.878
Even though I do think
labeling is a total sham...

09:43.961 --> 09:46.171
I see the power in reclaiming an epithet.

09:46.255 --> 09:48.340
Like you guys have with "nigga."

09:50.425 --> 09:53.846
Okay, maybe not that exactly.

09:53.929 --> 09:56.556
But... I really like you.

09:58.058 --> 10:01.145
Like, really a lot.
And I just--

10:01.228 --> 10:05.107
I wanna honor your feelings, you know,
if you wanna call this something.

10:05.190 --> 10:09.111
Like, we're girlfriend-girlfriend, or...

10:09.194 --> 10:10.780
lezzy togezzy.

10:10.863 --> 10:11.989
[laughing] I don't know.

10:12.072 --> 10:17.452
How about we say we're happy, yeah?
Leave it at that?

10:17.536 --> 10:19.496
Okay. [chuckles]

10:19.579 --> 10:20.580
Oh, shit.

10:22.708 --> 10:25.044
Hey! Hi! Hi...

10:25.711 --> 10:27.713
Judy, I'm...

10:27.797 --> 10:29.214
Hey, girl.
[chuckles]

10:29.298 --> 10:30.925
[Poussey stammers]

10:31.008 --> 10:32.718
You're... Fuck!

10:32.802 --> 10:34.053
[grumbling]

10:34.136 --> 10:39.224
It is so cute how moony you get
every time she's around.

10:39.308 --> 10:42.061
By "cute" you mean,
"lame as fuck."

10:42.144 --> 10:44.939
Well, yeah.
You need to pull it together.

10:45.022 --> 10:48.442
I mean, she's a person you admire,
but she's still just a person.

10:48.525 --> 10:50.194
A person. Right.

10:50.277 --> 10:53.238
You should be able to have
a conversation with anyone.

10:53.322 --> 10:55.741
Hi, I'm Brook.
I'm your neighbor.

10:55.825 --> 10:58.118
I was wondering if you'd heard
about the plans to build a Walmart

10:58.202 --> 10:59.662
at the corner of Exposition and Euclid?

10:59.745 --> 11:00.871
Yeah, I heard about it.

11:00.955 --> 11:03.958
Well, I'm one of a group of citizens
trying to convince the city council

11:04.041 --> 11:05.918
to turn that lot
into a park space instead.

11:06.001 --> 11:08.796
I was wondering if you'd be willing
to have a friendly discussion,

11:08.879 --> 11:10.589
or maybe even sign our petition?

11:10.672 --> 11:14.009
-Sure... if you take your top off.
-[all snickering]

11:14.093 --> 11:15.928
-Okay, that is inappropriate.
-Yes.

11:16.011 --> 11:19.014
Inappropriate things do happen out there.
How would you handle it?

11:19.098 --> 11:22.476
You really think a grown man
is gonna ask me to take my top off?

11:22.559 --> 11:27.522
Well, there's a sex offender
at 3134 10th Street. He might.

11:27.606 --> 11:29.691
No, you do not have to go
to the sex offender's house.

11:29.775 --> 11:33.403
No one has to knock on any door
that makes him or her feel uncomfortable.

11:33.487 --> 11:37.616
But I do urge you all to be bold
and stretch yourself.

11:37.699 --> 11:40.494
By the way, has everyone signed
their liability waivers?

11:41.495 --> 11:42.830
Oh, shit.

11:42.913 --> 11:45.540
I hear he likes little boys.

11:45.624 --> 11:48.210
Little boy, Asian girl,
are they really that far apart?

11:48.293 --> 11:50.838
You said our break-up
was going to be amicable.

11:50.921 --> 11:54.466
Yeah, I said a lot of things.
So did you, like, "I love you.

11:54.549 --> 11:57.386
I'll always love you.
This is not because of Oren."

11:57.469 --> 11:58.846
Wait, what?

11:58.929 --> 12:01.598
She dumped me to get with you.
I'm not sweet enough arm-candy.

12:01.681 --> 12:02.933
Oh, my God!

12:03.017 --> 12:04.977
Could you kids drop the soap opera
for another time?

12:05.060 --> 12:07.938
We're going out there this afternoon.
You need to feel like you're prepared.

12:08.022 --> 12:11.025
Well, clearly, she's not.
She can't even handle "take your top off."

12:11.108 --> 12:15.237
Okay, 50 bucks says
I get more signatures than you, Ethan.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.572
No bet.
People will sign just to shut you up.

12:17.656 --> 12:18.866
But here's a bet.

12:18.949 --> 12:21.493
Get the pedo to sign,
I'll give you your 50 bucks.

12:21.576 --> 12:24.121
And Oren will go on a date with you.
Cool?

12:24.204 --> 12:25.790
-I'm not really in--
-Okay!

12:25.873 --> 12:27.624
You are so on.

12:27.707 --> 12:29.668
He will sign and you will give me cash,

12:29.751 --> 12:32.963
and I will spend it on a new
hemp messenger bag and strawberry lube,

12:33.047 --> 12:36.175
because Oren seems
like a strawberry kind of guy.

12:36.258 --> 12:37.384
Well--

12:37.467 --> 12:41.763
[man] Great, now let's talk one more time
about mirroring body language.

12:41.847 --> 12:44.641
I'm just saying, if you bought me a watch,
I'd be on the time better.

12:44.724 --> 12:46.852
-There's a clock on the wall.
-Not in my office.

12:46.936 --> 12:48.312
I'll put a clock in your office.

12:48.395 --> 12:51.231
Or you could buy me a watch,
so when we out of the office like now,

12:51.315 --> 12:53.150
I could tell you things like,
"Hey, Mr. Caputo,

12:53.233 --> 12:54.944
we're only a few minutes late
to meet Piscatella,

12:55.027 --> 12:57.696
and you the boss anyhow, so relax."

12:57.779 --> 13:00.115
I will consider your watch request.

13:00.199 --> 13:02.242
Hey, I'm just trying
to make your life better.

13:02.326 --> 13:03.535
This ain't about me.

13:03.618 --> 13:05.454
By the way, what you want me to do
once we there?

13:05.537 --> 13:06.997
-Take notes.
-Hold up, hold up.

13:07.081 --> 13:11.168
"Take notes." Got you.

13:11.251 --> 13:12.419
[Piscatella] Mop it all around.

13:12.502 --> 13:14.004
Damn!

13:14.088 --> 13:18.968
This place is like
<i>Rehab Addict: Litchfield Edition.</i>

13:19.051 --> 13:20.886
And with, like, real addicts.

13:22.804 --> 13:24.223
[Piscatella] <i>So, in a nutshell...</i>

13:25.891 --> 13:28.602
electrical is still having
Internet issues,

13:28.685 --> 13:30.896
plumbing works,
but no hot water yet.

13:30.980 --> 13:34.733
All beds and extraneous furniture
are assembled and ready for move-in.

13:34.816 --> 13:36.944
-[scribbling]
-Now, the interior paint--

13:37.027 --> 13:38.028
Uh, inmate?

13:38.570 --> 13:41.198
What are you possibly writing
that will have any salience

13:41.281 --> 13:42.741
past this moment in time?

13:42.824 --> 13:46.370
Well, Mr. Caputo wants notes.
Now, I don't know what salience is,

13:46.453 --> 13:49.748
but I think a checklist
of what's completed and what's not

13:49.831 --> 13:51.208
is hella revalent.

13:51.291 --> 13:53.418
You mean "rel." Relevant.

13:53.502 --> 13:57.381
I mean, I'm trying to do my job,
same as you, big man.

13:58.132 --> 14:02.052
Are you...
suggesting that we are in any way,

14:02.136 --> 14:05.722
on any planet, in any universe,
the same, inmate?

14:05.805 --> 14:08.767
Why don't you go check on Luschek
and the Internet situation?

14:08.850 --> 14:12.729
-What?
-Let me watch you go.

14:13.730 --> 14:15.983
Oh, you gonna "watch me" watch me?

14:16.816 --> 14:19.319
I will watch... you.

14:19.403 --> 14:22.281
-Go!
-[chuckles] I'm goin'.

14:22.364 --> 14:25.367
It's clearly that...
[whispers] time.

14:25.450 --> 14:27.661
-Look at me go.
-Go.

14:29.371 --> 14:32.082
-May I ask you a question, Mr. Caputo?
-Shoot.

14:33.250 --> 14:37.087
How did you choose her to be
your assistant, exactly?

14:37.171 --> 14:39.089
-Between you and me?
-Yes, sir.

14:39.173 --> 14:43.635
She's the only semi-intelligent one
that I'm only...

14:43.718 --> 14:45.888
semi-attracted to.

14:45.971 --> 14:47.347
[laughs]

14:48.848 --> 14:51.018
Well, if you'll follow me,
I'll show you the bathroom.

14:51.101 --> 14:52.811
-[scribbling]
-What are you writing?

14:52.895 --> 14:54.104
Man, why everybody act like

14:54.188 --> 14:56.648
they ain't never seen a black woman
with a clipboard before?

14:56.731 --> 14:57.732
No, it's your pen.

14:57.816 --> 15:00.277
It's exorbitantly scratchy and
it's giving me anxiety.

15:00.360 --> 15:04.281
Damn, Word-A-Day.
I need to get me one of them calendars.

15:04.364 --> 15:07.409
"Anxiety" wasn't from the calendar.
That's just me.

15:07.492 --> 15:09.995
But... "exorbitant" was.

15:10.079 --> 15:11.455
Check out these fat phone cords.

15:11.538 --> 15:13.916
Shit, I could make so many bracelets
out of the wires in one of these--

15:13.999 --> 15:17.502
Uh-uh. Those ain't phone cords.
They're for the Internet.

15:17.586 --> 15:21.173
And believe me, you want some of them
guards to be able to watch their porn

15:21.256 --> 15:24.509
and get it all out before they on duty,
so you best leave it.

15:26.136 --> 15:28.847
So, hey, how come you don't
get to live here, Luschek?

15:30.099 --> 15:32.184
-Because I have a home, inmate.
-Oh, yeah?

15:32.267 --> 15:34.769
-An entire basement to myself.
-Hmm.

15:34.853 --> 15:37.940
You gotta admit, though,
it is kind of swanky... you know?

15:38.023 --> 15:41.193
I mean, you could fit
an entire family just right in here

15:41.276 --> 15:43.278
and still have room for a TV.

15:43.362 --> 15:46.531
Couple of pictures of X-rays.
Home sweet home.

15:46.615 --> 15:49.534
-Did you just say X-rays?
-I did say X-rays.

15:49.618 --> 15:51.536
'Cause when my grandmammy
broke her pelvis,

15:51.620 --> 15:53.538
all of us kids got X-rays.

15:53.622 --> 15:57.042
'Cause the doctor was really nice,
and my mom was doing him on the side.

15:57.126 --> 15:58.585
-[both laugh]
-That's funny, huh?

15:58.668 --> 16:02.297
He literally took an entire X-ray
of my whole skeleton,

16:02.381 --> 16:06.343
and I hung it up on my wall
like a fancy English guy.

16:06.426 --> 16:08.803
But it was just pictures of bones
instead of--

16:08.887 --> 16:11.348
You know, it wasn't, like, real bones.

16:11.431 --> 16:12.766
Your life is grotesque.

16:12.849 --> 16:15.560
-Another big word.
-What are you even doing here?

16:15.644 --> 16:19.564
Mr. Caputo wanted me to check up
on the Internet issue.

16:21.858 --> 16:23.193
Inmate...

16:23.277 --> 16:25.112
Scar-neck, explain the problem.

16:26.821 --> 16:27.990
It doesn't work.

16:29.366 --> 16:30.409
There you go.

16:30.492 --> 16:32.286
[Lorna] Hey, baby.

16:32.369 --> 16:34.621
[Vince] <i>Yeah, I thought you were</i>
<i>getting home an hour ago.</i>

16:34.704 --> 16:38.333
Oh, I know, the traffic was awful
coming back from the store.

16:38.417 --> 16:41.336
I think there was a wreck or something.

16:41.420 --> 16:45.382
Anyway, how was work?
How are you?

16:45.465 --> 16:47.592
-Vinnie?
-Look, I'm sorry.

16:47.676 --> 16:48.885
I'm just in a mood.

16:48.968 --> 16:50.595
Well, don't you worry.

16:50.679 --> 16:55.350
You just sit right down.
I'm gonna give you such a nice backrub.

16:55.434 --> 16:57.769
-Lorna...
-[Lorna moans]

16:57.852 --> 17:01.648
-Lorna!
<i>-Honey, you're so tense.</i>

17:01.731 --> 17:05.359
I'm reaching around and I'm feeling down

17:05.444 --> 17:09.573
your chiseled and bumpy abs.

17:09.656 --> 17:11.907
Oh, my goodness.

17:11.991 --> 17:16.246
I just found your cock-a-doodle-doo
and it's so hard.

17:16.329 --> 17:18.165
-[woman knocking] Vinnie? Hurry up!
-I'm busy!

17:18.248 --> 17:19.708
<i>All right?</i>

17:19.790 --> 17:22.294
Lorna, I can't really do this today, okay?

17:22.377 --> 17:24.503
Well, can you at least try?

17:24.588 --> 17:26.673
No, my roommates!
It's awkward.

17:26.756 --> 17:30.844
Well, I'm talking about kissing crotches
in front of 50 other women,

17:30.927 --> 17:32.971
but for you, it's awkward?

17:33.055 --> 17:34.473
I don't know,
I thought you were into that.

17:34.556 --> 17:35.932
Well, uh...

17:37.767 --> 17:41.105
Maybe you could feel that way
about your roommates.

17:41.188 --> 17:42.814
Don't say that.

17:42.897 --> 17:45.442
Well, do you have a speaker?
Put me on speaker, baby.

17:45.525 --> 17:48.278
I'll talk so nice for you and the boys.

17:49.238 --> 17:51.573
[woman] Vinnie, are you gonna help him
with his homework?

17:55.910 --> 17:59.289
Lorna, my roommates are my parents
and my kid brother.

17:59.373 --> 18:01.125
[scoffs] What?

18:01.208 --> 18:02.917
All right?
There, now you know.

18:03.001 --> 18:05.379
Well, why didn't you say that before?

18:06.213 --> 18:08.382
I mean, what kind of fantasy
is that gonna be?

18:08.465 --> 18:10.967
[stammers]
You thought you married a man, not a boy.

18:12.761 --> 18:14.053
Look, I gotta go, all right?

18:14.138 --> 18:16.848
Gino's back from school.
I gotta help him with his homework.

18:16.931 --> 18:18.808
[scoffs]

18:18.892 --> 18:19.976
Okay.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.111
I think he shares a room
with his kid brother.

18:29.194 --> 18:32.322
Does that mean no more phone-boning
in front of everybody?

18:32.406 --> 18:34.866
Because, legit,
that shit was kind of gross.

18:36.701 --> 18:38.203
But also hot.

18:39.788 --> 18:41.581
I'm having mixed emotions right now.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.876
Yeah, me, too.

18:49.173 --> 18:50.215
[gasps]

18:50.299 --> 18:54.052
She's taking all the green beans.
I asked her not to!

18:54.136 --> 18:56.388
Nicely, even!
Ignored.

18:56.471 --> 18:59.308
And her flunkeys,
always lurking around now.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.437
-Look!
-I'm looking.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.814
In Russia, we have a saying...

19:05.897 --> 19:09.734
[speaking Russian]

19:10.735 --> 19:14.198
"Don't open your mouth
to eat other people's bread."

19:14.281 --> 19:16.241
Or what?

19:16.325 --> 19:19.286
Ask the Germans in wintertime.

19:21.330 --> 19:22.956
-Uh, Miss Judy?
-Uh-huh.

19:23.039 --> 19:25.500
Uh, I was wondering if you would
sign my cookbook.

19:25.584 --> 19:26.585
Of course.

19:27.252 --> 19:29.379
That's so nice. Um...

19:29.463 --> 19:31.965
I'll buy one and bring it to you
when we both get out.

19:32.048 --> 19:33.925
All right, well,
we have a date, then.

19:34.008 --> 19:37.346
Now, thank you, ladies.
Bye-bye for now. All right.

19:38.638 --> 19:40.056
Mmm.

19:40.139 --> 19:42.016
Hey, there, Judy King.

19:42.100 --> 19:45.562
Oh, guilty as charged, in all respects.

19:46.938 --> 19:48.440
That's a joke, darlin'.

19:48.523 --> 19:49.774
Oh! [laughs]

19:49.858 --> 19:52.944
You know, a lot of people in here are
funny without meaning to be.

19:53.027 --> 19:54.821
I learned the hard way to hold my mirth.

19:54.904 --> 19:58.658
Oh, well, let your mirth fly free.
I mean to be funny.

19:58.742 --> 20:00.494
All right. [laughs]

20:00.577 --> 20:04.038
Um... actually, I was wondering if I could
speak to you about my friend.

20:04.122 --> 20:05.999
Oh, that little retarded girl?

20:06.082 --> 20:08.835
She's actually not...
challenged at all,

20:08.918 --> 20:11.796
which is what we're supposed to say,
not the R-word.

20:11.880 --> 20:16.050
Oh, uh...
"R"s, "F"s, "L-M-N-O-P"s and "Q"s.

20:16.134 --> 20:19.971
You know, I get in more trouble
for expanding those single letter words,

20:20.054 --> 20:21.723
but never "N"s.

20:21.806 --> 20:24.058
Despite this drawl,
I'm brighter than that.

20:24.142 --> 20:29.105
So, now, you were saying?
About your friend who is not challenged.

20:29.188 --> 20:30.940
-[chuckles]
-Am I allowed to say "special"?

20:31.024 --> 20:34.694
No, she's not special.
Well, she is to me.

20:34.778 --> 20:36.571
-Mmm.
-But not euphemistically.

20:36.655 --> 20:40.074
She's a fan and whenever she sees you,
she freaks out.

20:42.035 --> 20:44.037
You've gotta understand.

20:44.120 --> 20:49.083
Institutional racism... traps the most
vulnerable people in our society

20:49.167 --> 20:53.547
in this cycle of incarceration which,
in turn, leads to a cycle of poverty.

20:53.630 --> 20:58.302
It makes someone like you...
someone rich and powerful and white,

20:58.385 --> 21:00.512
virtually unapproachable.

21:00.595 --> 21:02.472
All right,
so now let me get this straight.

21:02.556 --> 21:06.685
Your friend acts like a moron around me
because she's black and poor?

21:06.768 --> 21:09.604
-Is that right?
-Basically... yes.

21:09.688 --> 21:13.650
[sighs] I think her mother was
a crack addict or something.

21:13.733 --> 21:15.652
You might as well be an alien.

21:15.735 --> 21:17.571
But you could bridge the divide.

21:17.654 --> 21:20.782
-The way you did.
-Yeah, exactly! [chuckles]

21:20.865 --> 21:24.661
All right, how about this?
Why don't you bring her over at lunch?

21:25.704 --> 21:27.539
Okay. [chuckles]

21:27.622 --> 21:32.544
It'll be like, uh...
the 1% sitting with the other 1%.

21:32.627 --> 21:33.628
Oh, my God.

21:33.712 --> 21:37.256
"The other 1%" is such a good hashtag.

21:37.341 --> 21:38.967
[chuckles]

21:39.050 --> 21:40.552
[chuckles]

21:43.888 --> 21:46.182
[man on TV] <i>The New Orleans police</i>
<i>put out a call to...</i>

21:46.265 --> 21:48.184
-Hi! My name is Brook...
-Look...

21:48.267 --> 21:49.686
...and I was wondering if--

21:49.769 --> 21:51.771
Take your picture
or smash an egg in my face,

21:51.855 --> 21:55.274
or whatever you need to do for you
and your friends to get your jollies.

21:55.900 --> 21:58.403
-But spare me the setup, all right?
-I don't have a setup.

21:58.487 --> 21:59.904
You know who I am?

22:00.489 --> 22:01.990
Yeah, I do, actually.

22:03.575 --> 22:04.993
You're a member of the community

22:05.076 --> 22:07.120
who has as much right as
any of your neighbors

22:07.203 --> 22:09.205
to be concerned about
the big-box monstrosity

22:09.288 --> 22:12.542
that's being proposed
for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.

22:12.626 --> 22:15.462
I'd be happy to talk about it with you,
if you have the time.

22:15.545 --> 22:18.423
Look, I'm watching
this Hurricane Katrina stuff.

22:18.507 --> 22:19.674
It's really intense.

22:19.758 --> 22:21.551
The world's gonna be lousy with Katrinas

22:21.635 --> 22:24.971
if we let mega-corporations like Walmart
carbon-bomb our planet.

22:31.269 --> 22:32.729
You wanna come in?

22:34.230 --> 22:35.774
Sure.

22:35.857 --> 22:37.942
Yeah, I'll give you the whole shpiel.

22:38.026 --> 22:39.360
Spiel.

22:39.444 --> 22:41.530
Sorry, I never know how to pronounce that.

22:41.613 --> 22:43.239
Wait, um...

22:43.322 --> 22:44.741
how old are you?

22:45.784 --> 22:46.868
Nineteen.

22:47.911 --> 22:48.912
Okay.

22:50.121 --> 22:51.205
Come in.

22:51.289 --> 22:54.042
[man on TV]
<i>...aspect of this terrible hurricane</i>

22:54.125 --> 22:57.587
<i>that came on land with 145 mile-an-hour...</i>

22:57.671 --> 22:58.880
Okay.

22:58.963 --> 23:01.340
I don't know if you realize,

23:01.425 --> 23:04.594
but the introduction of mega-retailers,
like Walmart,

23:04.678 --> 23:07.847
almost invariably have a negative effect
on property values--

23:07.931 --> 23:10.224
-You're so nervous.
-I'm not nervous.

23:10.308 --> 23:13.895
I'm passionate about saving
local businesses.

23:13.978 --> 23:15.313
Like Lola's Bloomers.

23:16.815 --> 23:19.943
-May I?
-Sure. Sure.

23:21.528 --> 23:23.572
Conservative estimates
are that there will be

23:23.655 --> 23:27.241
thousands of more cars in the neighborhood
per day because of the construction--

23:27.325 --> 23:30.870
It says you wanna put a park in instead.

23:30.954 --> 23:32.997
I can't live within 2,500 feet of a park.

23:33.081 --> 23:35.834
They would literally
kick me out of my own home.

23:40.088 --> 23:41.089
Sorry.

23:41.172 --> 23:43.800
Can I talk about the elephant in the room
for a second?

23:43.883 --> 23:45.343
I wish you wouldn't.

23:45.426 --> 23:47.637
I look across from me
and I don't see a monster.

23:47.721 --> 23:52.934
I see a human being fighting to control
the animalistic parts of his brain,

23:53.017 --> 23:54.978
true grit overcoming impulse.

23:55.061 --> 23:56.605
Not everybody judges you.

23:56.688 --> 23:58.940
What if I told you it was kiddie porn?

24:00.942 --> 24:02.360
I'd...

24:02.443 --> 24:03.778
say you need support,

24:03.862 --> 24:08.324
and I'd applaud your restraint for
finding an outlet for your compulsions.

24:08.407 --> 24:12.161
[scoffs] Wow!
You will really say whatever it takes.

24:13.705 --> 24:16.249
Well, it was a lot worse than kiddie porn.

24:16.332 --> 24:17.542
Wanna see?

24:18.627 --> 24:20.962
No, I don't... I don't need... No.

24:21.045 --> 24:22.380
No need.

24:23.089 --> 24:24.090
Um...

24:29.554 --> 24:31.681
Wait, all you did
was have sex on the beach?

24:31.765 --> 24:34.601
Consenting adults on an empty beach.

24:34.684 --> 24:37.979
Well, except for the creeper that
filmed it and turned us in to the cops.

24:38.062 --> 24:41.190
-But you think that pervo got in trouble?
-That is insane. I mean...

24:41.274 --> 24:43.985
[sighs] You are such a cautionary tale.

24:44.068 --> 24:47.321
I would be,
if people got the story right.

24:47.405 --> 24:50.992
But once I had to go around door-to-door
announcing my status,

24:51.075 --> 24:52.493
the rumors got started...

24:54.078 --> 24:57.165
I don't know.
It's all so fucked.

25:02.587 --> 25:03.713
Here.

25:07.216 --> 25:09.302
It's not like Walmart's gonna lose.

25:12.305 --> 25:13.347
Awesome.

25:13.431 --> 25:15.224
[sharpener whirring]

25:18.477 --> 25:20.188
[phone ringing]

25:23.441 --> 25:25.276
-Oh...
-[continues ringing]

25:26.110 --> 25:27.862
Uh... [clears throat]

25:27.946 --> 25:29.280
Warden Caputo's office.

25:29.363 --> 25:32.158
This is Ms. Jefferson speaking,
how may I assist you?

25:32.241 --> 25:33.993
[man] <i>Is Warden Caputo available?</i>

25:34.077 --> 25:37.330
Let me place you on a brief hold
while I go and check.

25:37.413 --> 25:38.832
[beeping]

25:39.498 --> 25:41.209
Fuck.

25:41.292 --> 25:42.836
Oh, well, you gonna call back.

25:42.919 --> 25:44.629
<i>Hello? I'm still here.</i>

25:45.839 --> 25:49.508
Damn, you are still there.
Then why the little light go out?

25:49.593 --> 25:52.053
Anyway, don't matter,
I ain't got him right now.

25:52.136 --> 25:53.805
<i>Will you please let him know I called?</i>

25:53.888 --> 25:56.182
All right, you take good care now.

25:56.265 --> 25:58.267
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-[breathes deeply]

25:58.351 --> 25:59.477
Shit.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.312
What? What happened?

26:01.395 --> 26:03.397
I didn't quite get his name.

26:03.982 --> 26:05.692
[sighs] You don't know who it was?

26:05.775 --> 26:07.401
Well, it was some brother,

26:07.485 --> 26:10.363
sounded like a salesman-type,
if you ask me.

26:10.446 --> 26:12.866
So I probably did you a favor there.

26:12.949 --> 26:18.079
Oh! And then some white lady,
she called about a get-together. Mmm-hmm.

26:18.162 --> 26:19.372
It happened twice?

26:19.455 --> 26:21.750
Jesus, Jefferson,
what am I paying you for?

26:22.541 --> 26:24.628
Are you sure she said "get-together"?

26:24.711 --> 26:27.421
What does that even mean?
Like... like, a meeting?

26:27.505 --> 26:29.007
Like a meeting.

26:29.090 --> 26:32.385
Or... like a date, maybe.

26:32.468 --> 26:34.470
You holding out on me?

26:34.553 --> 26:36.597
You somebody's Ca-baby-boo-to?

26:36.681 --> 26:38.725
You're on thin fucking ice, Jefferson.

26:42.603 --> 26:43.604
Was it Linda?

26:44.230 --> 26:45.231
Possibly.

26:46.565 --> 26:47.734
It wasn't Natalie, was it?

26:47.817 --> 26:49.944
[clicks tongue]
Linda sounds more right.

26:50.820 --> 26:53.823
Okay.
Get Linda from MCC on the line.

26:53.907 --> 26:54.991
All right.

26:57.201 --> 26:59.287
Press the button that says "Line one."

26:59.370 --> 27:01.289
-One.
-Nine and the number.

27:01.372 --> 27:02.540
Nine... Got you.

27:03.457 --> 27:06.210
-[muttering]
-[line ringing]

27:06.294 --> 27:08.379
-[clears throat]
-[Linda] <i>Uh, hello?</i>

27:08.462 --> 27:12.258
Yes, hello. I have Director Caputo.
I will transfer you now.

27:12.759 --> 27:14.385
[beeps]

27:14.468 --> 27:16.429
[blows raspberries] Shit!

27:18.264 --> 27:21.059
-[dialing]
-[phone rings]

27:21.726 --> 27:23.144
Warden Caputo's office.

27:23.227 --> 27:24.645
[Caputo] Jefferson, I got it.

27:24.729 --> 27:26.314
My bad! My bad!

27:26.397 --> 27:30.819
-[Linda] <i>Hello, uh, Joe?</i>
-Linda, hi. Uh...

27:30.902 --> 27:33.029
Jefferson, hang up your line.

27:33.112 --> 27:35.031
I don't wanna disconnect y'all.

27:35.114 --> 27:36.574
Hang up the phone!

27:38.159 --> 27:40.078
Uh, I'm still training her.

27:40.161 --> 27:43.456
Uh, I got your message
about a get-together.

27:43.539 --> 27:46.375
Oh, uh...
wrong Linda, I think.

27:46.459 --> 27:48.962
-[sighs]
<i>-But we do need to celebrate our victory.</i>

27:49.045 --> 27:50.797
All these veterans becoming guards.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.216
Yes. Yes, we absolutely do.

27:53.299 --> 27:54.759
Any chance you're free tonight?

27:55.760 --> 27:57.595
Tonight?

27:57.678 --> 27:59.723
Yes, it's perfect.

27:59.806 --> 28:01.599
Um...

28:01.682 --> 28:05.228
We can celebrate and,
uh, talk business.

28:05.311 --> 28:08.940
<i>-How about La Fontana's at 8:00?</i>
-Yeah, great. [chuckles]

28:09.023 --> 28:13.277
-Great. I'll see you tonight.
<i>-Okay, bye.</i>

28:16.865 --> 28:19.117
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

28:22.245 --> 28:25.957
Ah! Even the staff
waits for the bathroom now, hmm?

28:26.040 --> 28:28.542
What can I do for you, Red? [sighs]

28:28.626 --> 28:30.754
I want to talk to you
about the King woman.

28:30.837 --> 28:32.922
You two are hitting it off, right?

28:33.006 --> 28:36.092
You gave her the run of my garden.
How did you think that would go?

28:37.218 --> 28:41.597
You know, planting a flag on the Moon
doesn't mean that you own it.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.934
You're Russian.
I thought you'd appreciate that attitude.

28:45.018 --> 28:49.147
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm only concerned for her.

28:49.230 --> 28:51.858
Respect in prison has to be earned.

28:51.941 --> 28:53.902
I don't know about that.

28:53.985 --> 28:57.113
You've received a lot of leeway
from staff around here.

28:57.196 --> 28:58.697
You seem to be doing all right.

29:00.074 --> 29:03.369
Was that what this is about?
Are you punishing me?

29:04.495 --> 29:06.705
Did you do something wrong?

29:06.790 --> 29:09.793
I did the only reasonable thing I could.

29:12.211 --> 29:14.839
There's no such thing
as a consensual relationship

29:14.923 --> 29:16.674
between a prisoner and a guard.

29:17.508 --> 29:19.593
Lorna's wedding was a bittersweet end

29:19.677 --> 29:24.015
to a relationship that
never actually happened, Sam.

29:24.098 --> 29:26.309
-[toilet flushes]
-You're reading something into this

29:26.392 --> 29:28.812
that isn't there, Reznikov.

29:28.895 --> 29:31.522
And what goes on with Mrs. King
is none of your business.

29:31.605 --> 29:32.941
You're pampering her.

29:34.150 --> 29:35.568
Oops!

29:35.651 --> 29:37.236
[sighs]

29:37.320 --> 29:39.530
She even gets a magazine?

29:52.710 --> 29:53.795
What do you want, Ruiz?

29:53.878 --> 29:57.590
I heard about your labor dispute.
I thought maybe my friends could fill in?

29:57.673 --> 30:00.093
This is Pidge.

30:00.176 --> 30:03.054
You know Ouija,
or she knows you.

30:03.137 --> 30:04.931
And that's Zirconia.

30:05.014 --> 30:06.099
Zirconia?

30:06.182 --> 30:08.017
I took out all my rocks before I come in,

30:08.101 --> 30:11.312
so nobody would think they was diamonds
and rip 'em out.

30:11.395 --> 30:12.856
Plus...

30:12.939 --> 30:14.232
I don't think it's allowed.

30:14.315 --> 30:17.193
They're all ready and willing
to join your panty party.

30:17.276 --> 30:20.238
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Privately, please.

30:22.156 --> 30:25.451
What are you doing?
This is not a publicly traded company.

30:25.534 --> 30:28.704
Its very existence depends
on keeping its existence hidden.

30:28.787 --> 30:31.332
Chill the fuck out.
I was just trying to help you.

30:31.415 --> 30:32.959
I don't need your help.

30:33.042 --> 30:34.377
What I need is your discretion,

30:34.460 --> 30:37.505
and you bringing a bunch of thugs
into my house is the opposite of that.

30:37.588 --> 30:42.426
I decide who knows about Felonious Spunk.
I decide who gets hired.

30:42.510 --> 30:47.181
I am the prison pussy panty business.

30:48.182 --> 30:51.769
Somebody's getting
a little big for her panties, I think.

30:52.728 --> 30:55.314
I'm gonna choose to assume
you're talking about yourself

30:55.398 --> 30:56.732
and take that as an apology.

30:56.815 --> 30:58.026
[snickers]

30:58.109 --> 31:01.029
You're talking shit out a paper asshole,
Chapman.

31:01.112 --> 31:05.699
But when an actual hard-ass bitch
decides to call you on it...

31:05.783 --> 31:09.954
well...
[tutting and inhales sharply]

31:16.460 --> 31:19.547
Pretty sure she was talking about herself
on that last one.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.385
[Suzanne] <i>It's not fair.</i>

31:24.468 --> 31:27.889
It is the most unfair thing
that's ever happened in this prison.

31:27.972 --> 31:31.100
Mmm, what about when Carson went to SHU
for sneezing too loud?

31:31.184 --> 31:34.312
Or what's-her-face,
the Puerto Rican girl, with the gimpy eye?

31:34.395 --> 31:37.982
And when she got the wrong meds by
accident in the med line and went nutso,

31:38.066 --> 31:41.319
and gimped her other eye with a spork.
Now, she double gimp-eyed.

31:41.402 --> 31:44.613
Or how 'bout when Pornstache
used to make the meth heads

31:44.697 --> 31:47.033
blow him for drugs in the mop closet?

31:47.116 --> 31:49.368
Or the time Chapman got furlough?

31:49.452 --> 31:52.496
I retract and redact.

31:52.580 --> 31:53.872
New statement.

31:53.957 --> 31:59.045
It's easily the top 138 most unfair things
that has ever happened here.

31:59.128 --> 32:00.463
What is?

32:00.546 --> 32:01.755
Your new job.

32:01.839 --> 32:05.134
My job is the bomb!

32:05.218 --> 32:11.349
You sit at a desk all day when you were
plucked from the most rewarding job.

32:11.432 --> 32:15.353
I'm not saying it's on par
with all the human rights abuses in here,

32:15.436 --> 32:18.856
but women fought for a long time to shake
the role of desk-ridden secretary.

32:18.940 --> 32:20.441
Are you for real?

32:20.524 --> 32:22.776
-Hey!
-[all laugh]

32:22.860 --> 32:23.861
Do you get the Internet?

32:23.945 --> 32:26.447
-Do you have a mini-fridge?
-Ah!

32:26.530 --> 32:28.950
Do you have a skeleton key
made from real human bone

32:29.033 --> 32:31.744
that opens a door to a world
of talking animals?

32:31.827 --> 32:33.537
Man, I got me a clipboard

32:33.621 --> 32:37.583
and a personal relationship
with Mr. Caputo.

32:37.666 --> 32:39.168
-[mimics buzzing]
-[all laugh]

32:39.252 --> 32:41.795
Man, if George R. R. Martin
wrote about prisons,

32:41.879 --> 32:45.508
I'd be, like...
the Hand of the Warden.

32:45.591 --> 32:47.343
Yo, don't the Hand
always die in them books?

32:47.426 --> 32:49.512
Man, whatever, okay?

32:49.595 --> 32:53.141
Winter is coming, bitches.

32:53.224 --> 32:55.351
And I'm getting me a watch.

32:55.434 --> 32:57.186
-For real?
-Yes.

32:57.270 --> 32:59.188
Hey. [chuckles]

33:00.023 --> 33:01.815
Yo...

33:01.899 --> 33:03.985
I feel like she's smiling
and waving at me.

33:04.068 --> 33:06.404
[mouthing]

33:06.487 --> 33:09.448
Maybe she can see dead people
and there's one standing right...

33:09.532 --> 33:10.741
right in front of you.

33:10.824 --> 33:12.576
Are the hairs standing up
on the back of your neck?

33:12.660 --> 33:14.453
I feel like I'm the dead person.

33:14.537 --> 33:17.790
I... may have set you up
on a blind friend date!

33:17.873 --> 33:19.458
-Wait, you did what? No!
-Surprise!

33:19.542 --> 33:22.670
-What?
-[chuckling] I just talked you up.

33:22.753 --> 33:25.048
-Go! Be yourself.
-Yo...

33:26.382 --> 33:29.177
[both giggling]

33:31.179 --> 33:34.182
-Go, P!
-Go, P! Go, P!

33:34.265 --> 33:36.934
-Let me fix your clothes.
-Get off me!

33:37.018 --> 33:39.478
Hey. [chuckles]

33:39.562 --> 33:40.896
You must be Poo-see.

33:40.979 --> 33:42.273
She called her Poo-see!

33:42.356 --> 33:44.358
No, I'm sorry.
Did I say that right?

33:44.442 --> 33:46.610
Yeah, yeah.
Poussey, it's French.

33:46.694 --> 33:48.362
Oh, French.

33:48.446 --> 33:50.364
I was named after a great aunt

33:50.448 --> 33:53.992
who hid pearls from the Yankees
under her pendulous breasts.

33:54.077 --> 33:55.161
[laughs nervously]

33:55.244 --> 33:59.457
And she also brewed a famous home remedy
that supposedly cured hookworm.

33:59.540 --> 34:01.417
-Not quite so exotic.
-Listen.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.252
-Hmm.
-I... I feel...

34:03.336 --> 34:04.628
I feel like I need to apologize...

34:04.712 --> 34:06.004
-Uh-uh.
-...for just being all, like,

34:06.089 --> 34:08.174
weird and stuff, you know,
I just...

34:08.257 --> 34:10.051
-I dig your whole thing, you know.
-[chuckles]

34:10.134 --> 34:13.554
And I just, I watch your show so much,
so seeing you in person was just,

34:13.637 --> 34:15.681
you know, I got all tongue-tied,
and fan-girly and stuff.

34:15.764 --> 34:17.100
So I'd try to say words,

34:17.183 --> 34:19.016
but when they came out of my mouth,
it just sound like...

34:19.101 --> 34:21.895
All right, all right, all right.
Relax, darlin'.

34:21.978 --> 34:25.315
Your friend has told me the whole story.
She has got you covered.

34:29.527 --> 34:32.447
You gotta sink a hook in the keepers,
especially in this place.

34:32.531 --> 34:34.533
-Uh-huh.
-You know, it's funny.

34:34.617 --> 34:36.869
Me and Brook,
we never would've crossed paths.

34:36.952 --> 34:38.911
I mean, growing up all over the world,

34:38.996 --> 34:42.083
bouncing culture to culture with a strict,
conservative family,

34:42.166 --> 34:45.753
versus, you know, sleeping in tent cities
with a bunch of dirty hippies,

34:45.835 --> 34:47.920
eating food out of dumpsters.
Oof!

34:48.005 --> 34:50.007
You have been through a lot.

34:50.549 --> 34:53.261
[stammers] Nah, it was...
I mean, it was good.

34:53.344 --> 34:55.554
Well, I mean,
it was hard, you know?

34:55.638 --> 34:57.348
Like, I guess being transient,

34:57.431 --> 34:59.892
and not really having
any long-term friends,

34:59.975 --> 35:02.145
but I do know three languages.

35:02.228 --> 35:03.729
Hmm! Wait...

35:03.812 --> 35:06.399
-you know three languages?
-[chuckles] Yeah.

35:06.482 --> 35:09.193
How does the child of a crack whore
learn three languages?

35:09.277 --> 35:11.862
-That is remarkable.
-Excuse me?

35:11.945 --> 35:13.197
What languages?

35:13.281 --> 35:16.992
English, French and German.
Did you just call my mother a crack whore?

35:18.369 --> 35:21.580
My mother had a masters in Art History
and she could barely take an aspirin.

35:21.664 --> 35:23.999
-Excuse me?
-My dad is a major in the army.

35:24.082 --> 35:25.626
I was supposed to go to West Point.

35:27.420 --> 35:29.713
I guess you were expecting
just another ghetto prison rat.

35:32.007 --> 35:34.177
At least one of us
lives up to the stereotype.

35:34.260 --> 35:36.220
What, no! Sweetheart, no!

35:36.304 --> 35:39.640
You have snatched the taste
right out of my mouth.

35:39.723 --> 35:42.435
I'm just parroting what your girlfriend
told me about you.

35:42.518 --> 35:46.730
You came out of a cycle of poverty,
blah, blah, blah.

35:47.606 --> 35:52.320
I mean, it seems to me that you two formed
this relationship without talking much.

35:58.284 --> 36:00.869
Did you know I am learning Italian?

36:00.953 --> 36:02.330
[sighs]

36:11.129 --> 36:12.756
[stammers]

36:13.591 --> 36:14.592
[sighs]

36:16.344 --> 36:18.679
[indistinct chatter]

36:18.762 --> 36:21.640
So, did Chester the Molester sign?

36:21.724 --> 36:24.393
You owe me 50 bucks.

36:24.477 --> 36:26.979
-Whoa.
-And you better take me out.

36:27.062 --> 36:28.939
I can't believe you had
the balls to do it.

36:29.022 --> 36:30.899
Whatever, he probably finger-banged

36:30.983 --> 36:34.570
his 15-year-old girlfriend when he was
17 or something else no big.

36:34.653 --> 36:36.405
The sex offender lists
are full of sob stories

36:36.489 --> 36:39.533
about people's lives being
ruined by technicalities.

36:39.617 --> 36:41.619
I read all about it on Salon.com.

36:42.661 --> 36:46.915
[scoffs]
You know, as a matter of fact,

36:46.999 --> 36:51.920
he was a fucking horrible
child-molester rapist.

36:52.004 --> 36:53.839
Because I'm so sure he told you that.

36:53.922 --> 36:57.510
Yeah, 'cause he...
He fucking tried to seduce me.

36:58.802 --> 37:00.429
He invited me in for lemonade.

37:00.513 --> 37:02.973
-And you went in?
-Yeah.

37:03.056 --> 37:05.017
He told me I didn't look 19.

37:05.100 --> 37:07.645
[inhales deeply]
That's when I knew I was in trouble.

37:07.728 --> 37:08.896
Shit.

37:10.606 --> 37:11.899
He stroked my hair.

37:11.982 --> 37:17.029
[scoffs] He wanted to brag,
so he showed me the newspaper article

37:17.112 --> 37:20.366
about how he stalked this
nine-year-old girl from his church,

37:20.449 --> 37:22.117
for, like, a year.

37:22.200 --> 37:26.289
Earning her trust,
gradually convincing her to...

37:26.372 --> 37:28.416
Well, to...

37:28.499 --> 37:30.083
[sighs] To...

37:31.919 --> 37:35.256
[exhales sharply]
And then I was running down the street.

37:36.799 --> 37:39.134
For your fucking bet, Ethan.

37:39.217 --> 37:41.094
For 50 fucking dollars.

37:43.055 --> 37:45.766
But also because I...

37:45.849 --> 37:47.560
because I wanted to go out with you.

37:52.064 --> 37:53.816
[exhales deeply]

37:55.484 --> 37:58.612
[Caputo] I really appreciate you coming
all the way down from Utica.

37:59.363 --> 38:02.074
Sorry, again, I couldn't get a seat
in one of the gondolas.

38:02.157 --> 38:04.910
No, no, it's okay.
This is great.

38:04.993 --> 38:06.787
I'm really glad that you thought I called.

38:06.870 --> 38:07.871
[chuckles]

38:07.955 --> 38:10.791
These new guards,
they're a... they're a big win for us.

38:10.874 --> 38:12.042
Like, "us" us.

38:13.126 --> 38:15.128
And the company,
but especially "us" us.

38:15.212 --> 38:18.549
Yeah. We're not a bad team,
Linda from Purchasing.

38:19.592 --> 38:22.219
To us,
Joe from Litchfield Human Activity,

38:22.303 --> 38:24.305
and our continued wins.

38:24.388 --> 38:27.891
-And to the veterans, of course.
-Of course. [chuckles]

38:28.517 --> 38:30.143
<i># Happy, happy birthday clappy #</i>

38:30.227 --> 38:32.020
<i># Join us as we celebrate #</i>

38:32.104 --> 38:33.897
<i># Clap your hands and dance around #</i>

38:33.981 --> 38:35.608
<i># Have a laugh and eat some cake #</i>

38:35.691 --> 38:38.276
<i># Happy birthday, happy birthday</i>
<i>Happy birthday #</i>

38:38.361 --> 38:39.653
<i># You're so great! #</i>

38:39.737 --> 38:41.655
[all cheering]

38:44.533 --> 38:45.618
What?

38:45.701 --> 38:47.995
The bald guy... is, uh...

38:48.078 --> 38:50.163
one of our former guards.

38:50.247 --> 38:52.916
A really good guy. Donaldson.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.919
A good guy...
who walked out in the middle of

38:56.003 --> 38:58.964
an inmate transfer/high-profile
self-surrender?

38:59.047 --> 39:01.550
Yeah, I get your point.

39:01.634 --> 39:03.802
Don't beat yourself up, Joe.

39:03.886 --> 39:06.805
You handled that situation
like a total boss.

39:07.431 --> 39:10.351
Meant both literally
and in that hip-kid lingo way.

39:10.434 --> 39:11.685
Jesus!

39:11.769 --> 39:15.022
He's not even a fucking waiter.

39:15.105 --> 39:17.608
-He's a busboy.
-[laughs]

39:18.567 --> 39:19.777
-What?
-No, just...

39:19.860 --> 39:22.070
you could've lost your job...

39:22.154 --> 39:25.240
or faced prosecution had
inmates gone missing that day.

39:25.323 --> 39:31.455
I mean, you're concerned about...
these jerks that hung you out to dry.

39:31.539 --> 39:33.541
You're quite a guy, Joe Caputo.

39:35.208 --> 39:36.710
[waiter] There you go, sir.
Whenever you're ready.

39:36.794 --> 39:39.087
-Uh, do me a favor, will you?
-[waiter] Mmm-hmm.

39:39.171 --> 39:40.839
-The change is yours.
-Okay.

39:40.923 --> 39:43.133
Give a 20 to that busboy over there.

39:43.216 --> 39:45.969
Wait till we're gone.
I don't want to make a thing of it, okay?

39:46.053 --> 39:47.430
[waiter] Okay.

39:48.514 --> 39:49.890
Hey, Mr. Caputo!

39:50.808 --> 39:53.018
-Look, Donaldson--
-I don't need your money, Mr. Caputo.

39:53.101 --> 39:54.352
It's nothing, take it, it's--

39:54.437 --> 39:55.938
Nah, this is not to help me.

39:56.021 --> 39:58.273
This is to make you feel better
about that...

39:58.356 --> 40:00.609
pardon my French, miss,
bullshit you pulled.

40:00.693 --> 40:03.487
-Okay, Joe, let's go.
-The bullshit I pulled?

40:03.571 --> 40:06.407
I work three jobs.
This is the good one.

40:06.490 --> 40:09.159
O'Neill?
I heard he had kidney stones.

40:09.242 --> 40:10.453
But no health insurance.

40:10.536 --> 40:12.663
So he thought he'd power through,
wait for it to pass.

40:12.746 --> 40:13.789
It didn't.

40:13.872 --> 40:16.709
Now he's on dialysis.
He may lose a kidney.

40:16.792 --> 40:18.461
-Jesus.
-Yeah.

40:18.544 --> 40:21.797
So take your $20 and drown
your conscience in a bottle of gin,

40:21.880 --> 40:24.049
because paying me to feel better about it
ain't gonna work.

40:27.302 --> 40:28.596
Donaldson.

40:31.389 --> 40:35.227
You tell O'Neill
I'm sorry about his stones.

40:35.310 --> 40:37.145
I'm also sorry you gotta work here.

40:37.229 --> 40:39.648
But I need you to understand something.

40:40.941 --> 40:44.903
I'm sorry for you.
I don't regret firing any of you.

40:44.987 --> 40:50.158
You walked out on the biggest day
the prison's faced in 25 fuckin' years.

40:50.242 --> 40:53.537
You put the prisoners at risk,
you put your fellow COs at risk,

40:53.621 --> 40:56.749
you put this whole town in danger!

40:56.832 --> 40:59.334
The shit hit
and instead of moving the fan away,

40:59.417 --> 41:02.796
[stammers] you plugged it in
and you hit "oscillate."

41:05.633 --> 41:08.469
I was gonna make you
captain of the guard, Wade.

41:12.430 --> 41:13.891
Really.

41:13.974 --> 41:15.267
You keep the 20.

41:16.351 --> 41:19.522
Least I could do
for helping me dodge a bullet.

41:21.023 --> 41:22.232
I'm sorry about this.

41:29.490 --> 41:34.161
These houses are yours to live in,
but they are prison property.

41:34.244 --> 41:36.413
They will be treated with respect.

41:36.497 --> 41:40.793
As long as they are treated with respect,
you will be as well.

41:40.876 --> 41:44.046
Okay, the warden has asked me to do a...

41:44.672 --> 41:46.799
icebreaker event.

41:48.008 --> 41:51.887
I will demonstrate this activity
with CO...

41:51.970 --> 41:54.431
-McCullough, sir.
-Okay, McCullough.

41:54.515 --> 41:59.603
Tell me two true things about you
and one lie.

41:59.687 --> 42:02.565
I will attempt to guess the lie.

42:04.149 --> 42:05.859
Okay, um...

42:05.943 --> 42:08.987
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

42:09.071 --> 42:11.156
I came to say I'm sorry.

42:16.494 --> 42:18.038
I'm sorry.

42:22.918 --> 42:26.296
Okay, please don't lock me out.
You're right to be upset.

42:26.379 --> 42:27.756
How would you know?

42:29.550 --> 42:31.635
You don't know anything about me, Soso.

42:32.636 --> 42:34.471
[scoffs]

42:34.555 --> 42:37.182
And, what, you think I'm upset
about my mom's crack abuse

42:37.265 --> 42:39.977
or because I grew up poor, black
and uneducated in the urban jungle?

42:40.060 --> 42:43.188
Okay, I watched <i>The Wire</i> a lot.
I made assumptions.

42:43.271 --> 42:44.982
But you spent time with me.

42:45.983 --> 42:47.860
I mean, did you even listen when I talked?

42:47.943 --> 42:50.779
Like, what the fuck about me,
besides the color of my skin,

42:50.863 --> 42:53.115
would indicate that I'm
some indigent hood rat?

42:55.200 --> 42:56.577
-I don't know.
-[scoffs]

42:56.660 --> 42:59.537
No, it's fine, it's cool.
I'm guilty, too. I won't lie.

42:59.622 --> 43:02.290
You know, I like the story of the rich,
white, hippie girl in my bed.

43:02.374 --> 43:03.792
I've been working that on my end.

43:08.088 --> 43:09.798
I don't want this to end.

43:23.896 --> 43:25.022
[Gloria] What good is coming up here

43:25.105 --> 43:26.899
and sitting in the lobby
every weekend gonna do?

43:26.982 --> 43:30.110
She wants to get Sophia out,
she needs to get a lawyer

43:30.193 --> 43:32.154
or a non-profit involved or something.

43:32.237 --> 43:35.073
Ms. Burset said that the prison
has tons of lawyers,

43:35.157 --> 43:37.618
so at least coming up here
and waiting for the warden to come out

43:37.701 --> 43:39.787
to get into his face is something...

43:39.870 --> 43:41.579
Michael started a Kickstarter campaign.

43:41.664 --> 43:43.248
Kickstarter? What that mean?

43:43.331 --> 43:45.125
Not much, usually.

43:45.208 --> 43:47.711
There's nothing to be ashamed about.

43:47.795 --> 43:49.797
Plenty of guys live with their parents.

43:49.880 --> 43:51.214
Right, yeah, I mean, you know...

43:51.298 --> 43:54.051
I'm just doing this to save money,
you know?

43:54.134 --> 43:56.344
'Cause I could live on my own, obviously.

43:56.428 --> 44:00.140
Oof! Obviously.
I mean, very, very obviously.

44:00.223 --> 44:03.101
It just makes the most financial sense,
you know?

44:03.185 --> 44:04.311
For the both of us.

44:04.895 --> 44:06.689
Oh!

44:06.772 --> 44:11.401
That's my manicotti,
always thinking of his little lasagna.

44:11.484 --> 44:14.446
[chuckles] Hey...

44:16.198 --> 44:17.991
I made you something.

44:19.534 --> 44:21.203
Fresh baked.

44:22.162 --> 44:23.163
Lorna...

44:23.246 --> 44:25.916
No, no, no, don't say it.

44:25.999 --> 44:28.836
You know, even though
it took a lot of time,

44:28.919 --> 44:31.379
and I had to go to the store twice,

44:31.463 --> 44:35.175
you... are worth it.

44:43.058 --> 44:44.351
[exhales deeply]

44:45.643 --> 44:47.354
[sniffs]

44:47.437 --> 44:48.814
Hmm.

44:51.734 --> 44:52.735
Mmm!

44:52.818 --> 44:55.528
-Mmm!
-It's still warm.

44:56.529 --> 44:58.531
My favorite.

44:58.615 --> 45:00.868
Peanut butter and M&M's.

45:00.951 --> 45:02.953
-Snickerdoodles.
-Oh!

45:03.036 --> 45:05.455
-I love you.
-Oh!

45:05.538 --> 45:08.333
And you should.
I am quite a catch.

45:08.416 --> 45:11.461
Oh, my God, you are.
You so are.

45:11.544 --> 45:12.587
[exhales deeply]

45:12.670 --> 45:14.006
Fuck.

45:15.924 --> 45:17.425
I want you.

45:18.426 --> 45:20.637
-Vinnie.
-I want you.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.097
It's our living room.

45:22.180 --> 45:24.641
The neighbors want to look in,
that's their good luck.

45:25.809 --> 45:27.602
I'm already unbuttoning my shirt.

45:28.311 --> 45:31.940
My goodness, you know that
I can't resist your muscular chest.

45:32.024 --> 45:33.691
Oh, my God.

45:33.776 --> 45:36.319
My hands,
they're in your hair right now.

45:37.070 --> 45:38.864
-I'm stroking it real soft.
-[panting]

45:38.947 --> 45:41.408
Till I grab a handful of it
and pull it back.

45:41.491 --> 45:44.244
[moans] You're such a man.

45:44.327 --> 45:46.163
[Vince] Oh, God.
I'm licking your neck.

45:46.246 --> 45:47.790
Kissing your ears.

45:47.873 --> 45:50.417
My hand is on that
big mountain in your pants,

45:50.500 --> 45:53.045
and I am unzipping you right now.

45:53.128 --> 45:55.964
And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.

45:56.048 --> 45:57.674
No, no, no, it's a button-up.

45:57.757 --> 46:00.260
-I unbutton it real slow.
-No, no, no, tear it off.

46:00.343 --> 46:01.469
-Pulling it off. It's off.
-Tear it off.

46:01.553 --> 46:03.596
It's off, the buttons, they're everywhere.
They're everywhere.

46:03.680 --> 46:06.474
Oh, my God, my mouth...
My mouth is on those big titties.

46:06.558 --> 46:09.394
-My nipples are so hard right now.
-Oh, my God, my cock.

46:09.477 --> 46:11.021
Oh, my God,
my cock is really hard.

46:11.104 --> 46:12.272
I know, baby.

46:12.355 --> 46:14.149
No, it's really hard.
Like, right now, it's really hard.

46:14.232 --> 46:16.068
-I know, Vinnie...
-Oh, God.

46:16.151 --> 46:18.028
-Vinnie, put it inside me.
-Yeah?

46:18.111 --> 46:21.865
Oh, my God, it's in you.
Oh, it's in you.

46:21.949 --> 46:23.783
-Oh, my God, it's in you.
-[Lorna moaning]

46:23.867 --> 46:25.077
It feels so good.

46:25.160 --> 46:26.829
You're so wet.
You are so wet.

46:26.912 --> 46:28.496
I actually am.

46:28.580 --> 46:30.498
-I'm super wet right now.
-I know.

46:30.582 --> 46:32.209
[both panting]

46:32.292 --> 46:33.418
Do it to me.

46:33.501 --> 46:35.503
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.

46:35.587 --> 46:37.339
-Don't stop.
-I'm not stopping.

46:37.422 --> 46:38.798
I'm not stopping.
I'm not gonna stop.

46:38.882 --> 46:41.676
I'm not gonna stop.
Oh, my God.

46:41.759 --> 46:43.761
-Oh, baby!
-[strained] Oh, my God!

46:44.429 --> 46:46.764
[yells]

46:48.516 --> 46:50.560
[man] He's humping the table.

46:50.643 --> 46:51.644
[Vince sighs]

46:52.437 --> 46:55.107
-[panting]
-[woman] What the hell?

46:56.024 --> 47:00.445
Hey! Hey, stay right here.
Stay looking at me, all right?

47:01.029 --> 47:02.530
Jesus Christ.

47:02.614 --> 47:04.157
[man] Don't think I don't see you.

47:08.411 --> 47:10.288
Pleasure, as always.

47:10.372 --> 47:13.041
Also, I want to talk to you
about something.

47:13.125 --> 47:15.835
If this is about last week,
I don't get to control my flow.

47:15.919 --> 47:18.630
I think it's all the stress
of all these new bitches in here.

47:19.256 --> 47:22.509
I know these last few weeks
have had their challenges.

47:22.592 --> 47:25.888
So... I wanted to say thank you.

47:25.971 --> 47:28.348
And keep up the good work.

47:28.431 --> 47:30.850
Your morale is important to me.

47:30.934 --> 47:33.478
Oh! That's so sweet.

47:33.561 --> 47:34.646
Ovaltine?

47:34.729 --> 47:36.023
It's to make chocolate milk.

47:36.106 --> 47:37.857
Pretty much only
Chinese people drink it now,

47:37.941 --> 47:41.694
which is probably why it's at commissary,
but it's really good.

47:41.778 --> 47:44.031
So, it's chocolate powder
for my powdered milk?

47:44.114 --> 47:45.323
It's got vitamins.

47:45.407 --> 47:46.699
Oh!

47:46.783 --> 47:49.119
See? New bitches.

47:49.202 --> 47:52.998
Why are they always staring like they're
waiting for a donkey show to start?

47:53.081 --> 47:55.959
I don't think they're staring at you.
They were following us earlier.

47:56.043 --> 47:57.294
And you didn't say anything?

47:57.377 --> 47:58.878
People can stare.

47:58.962 --> 48:01.006
-It's a free country.
-Not in prison.

48:01.089 --> 48:02.882
See, this is what I'm talking about.

48:02.966 --> 48:05.260
I bet your Bloody Mary
gonna come early, too.

48:15.478 --> 48:17.314
[indistinct chatter]

48:36.874 --> 48:37.875
Hey.

48:39.586 --> 48:40.670
Hey.

48:43.715 --> 48:45.717
[sighs]

48:47.677 --> 48:48.678
You okay?

48:48.761 --> 48:51.514
-No. You?
-[exhales deeply]

48:51.598 --> 48:53.058
No.

48:54.184 --> 48:55.435
Do you want to talk about it?

49:02.067 --> 49:04.527
Not really. You?

49:11.826 --> 49:14.121
But have you ever heard the phrase
"paper asshole"?

49:15.622 --> 49:17.249
[chuckles] No.

49:17.332 --> 49:18.708
Ruiz said it to me.

49:20.085 --> 49:22.004
I think I pissed off the Dominicans.

49:22.879 --> 49:24.714
Relax.

49:24.797 --> 49:29.011
You run the Litchfield panty company...
not the Sinaloa drug cartel.

49:30.220 --> 49:32.514
No one's stitching your face
to a soccer ball.

49:34.849 --> 49:36.559
See ya around, Pipes.

49:44.026 --> 49:45.277
[Gloria] What's this?

49:45.360 --> 49:47.195
[in Spanish] It's for the eyes.
Takes the red out.

49:47.279 --> 49:49.947
[in English] I know what it is, <i>pendeja.</i>
What's it doing out? It's contraband.

49:50.032 --> 49:52.534
Whoops!
I need to be more careful.

49:52.617 --> 49:55.245
Yeah, you do. A few drops
of that falls into the food,

49:55.328 --> 49:57.247
and this whole prison will be
shitting their brains out.

49:57.330 --> 49:59.291
Really? I had no idea.

49:59.374 --> 50:03.670
She acts so tough,
but to stress-eat this food?

50:03.753 --> 50:05.047
The poor woman.

50:05.130 --> 50:08.175
[laughs]
Oh, you evil, Russian bitch.

50:08.258 --> 50:12.804
What can I say?
I do a lot with a little.

50:12.887 --> 50:14.431
[laughs]

50:23.356 --> 50:24.691
No!

50:24.774 --> 50:26.693
No! No!

50:26.776 --> 50:29.112
[inmate] What the fuck?
That's my toilet paper.

50:30.405 --> 50:31.948
-[defecating]
-Oh!

50:32.031 --> 50:34.159
[rap music playing in distance]

50:46.129 --> 50:48.005
I talk a lot.

50:49.591 --> 50:51.551
I babble...

50:51.634 --> 50:55.555
until I find something the person
I'm with is interested in.

50:55.638 --> 50:59.101
And I'll say anything I can
to get them to like me.

51:00.602 --> 51:05.815
But I... really... really like you.

51:08.151 --> 51:09.527
The real you.

51:10.237 --> 51:12.239
[scoffs] You don't know the real me.

51:13.406 --> 51:14.991
But I want to.

51:16.659 --> 51:20.622
So in, like, a minute,
I'm gonna put down this radio,

51:20.705 --> 51:24.167
and I'm gonna listen to you
tell me about yourself.

51:24.251 --> 51:29.214
And I'm not gonna try
to rewrite your story in my head.

51:30.215 --> 51:33.676
And then, when you're done,
I'd like to tell you about myself.

51:33.760 --> 51:35.553
[sighs]

51:35.637 --> 51:40.892
And some of it will be
embarrassing and ugly...

51:40.975 --> 51:42.644
but mostly boring. [exhales]

51:45.230 --> 51:47.274
And then...

51:47.357 --> 51:51.403
maybe afterwards, we could, like...
quiz each other or something?

51:54.781 --> 51:56.324
Eminem?

51:56.991 --> 51:58.785
[chuckles]

51:58.868 --> 52:02.914
Yeah, it's not a presumption
about you liking rap.

52:02.997 --> 52:07.419
It's just... AM 700 The OG
is the only station that comes in clear.

52:09.212 --> 52:11.673
[snickers and clears throat]

52:16.052 --> 52:17.845
Jackson, North Carolina.

52:22.099 --> 52:23.560
Is that where you were born?

52:24.186 --> 52:27.146
No, that's where
my great-grandmother was born.

52:31.943 --> 52:35.197
I mean, stuffed crust shoulda
revolutionized pizza,

52:35.280 --> 52:38.575
-but it was just a fad.
-Man, nah, it's the same thing.

52:38.658 --> 52:40.535
-Man, it is not the same thing!
-All right.

52:40.618 --> 52:45.498
'Cause that's Italian...
this is Mexican.

52:45.582 --> 52:50.503
You got a stuffed tortilla,
and you stuff that with more stuff.

52:50.587 --> 52:52.339
-[faint humming]
-Man, it's my golden ticket,

52:52.422 --> 52:55.467
and I'm gonna do it right
with that business savvy and shit.

52:55.550 --> 52:57.969
-[scatting]
-Hey, hey, hey!

52:59.178 --> 53:00.472
Do you hear that?

53:00.555 --> 53:02.139
[humming continues]

53:03.140 --> 53:04.267
What is that?

53:05.435 --> 53:06.978
[inmate] Wow, look at that.

53:07.061 --> 53:08.771
[inmates chatting indistinctly]

53:09.564 --> 53:11.399
That's a drone.

53:11.483 --> 53:14.569
-It's a drone.
-Shit! What's it doing here?

53:14.652 --> 53:16.696
Like we some Iraqi wedding?

53:16.779 --> 53:18.906
Man, come on.
We're gonna be late.

53:21.326 --> 53:24.746
He was a bad man and we did good things.

53:24.829 --> 53:27.707
He did bad things and we killed him good.

53:28.875 --> 53:30.960
No, we did bad.

53:31.043 --> 53:32.044
No!

53:32.128 --> 53:33.713
We did well.

54:12.585 --> 54:14.086
[whispering] Hey.

54:14.170 --> 54:15.254
Have you seen Whitehill?

54:22.178 --> 54:24.347
Yeah, I forgot the garden needed turning.

54:24.431 --> 54:27.099
If Rikerson comes back,
just tell him where we went, okay?

54:32.229 --> 54:33.648
Oh, fuck!

54:35.483 --> 54:37.485
[grunting]

54:37.985 --> 54:40.029
-No! No!
-Lolly, Lolly.

54:40.112 --> 54:41.280
-[shushing]
-Listen, listen.

54:41.364 --> 54:43.032
They know! They know!

54:43.115 --> 54:45.827
They found you!
We have to move the body!

54:45.910 --> 54:48.204
[whispering] Shut up.
We cannot move the body.

54:48.287 --> 54:50.039
There's drones.

54:50.122 --> 54:51.458
Stop it, Lolly.

54:52.917 --> 54:54.877
We cannot move it.

54:56.087 --> 54:59.341
If I told you I already moved it,
would it calm you down?

55:01.133 --> 55:02.259
Maybe for a minute.

55:02.344 --> 55:05.012
Good, 'cause I did.

55:05.096 --> 55:06.138
Now, scat.

55:10.477 --> 55:12.645
[fence opens and closes]

55:13.980 --> 55:15.357
You didn't actually move it.

55:15.440 --> 55:18.360
Hell, no.
And I'm not about to.

55:20.236 --> 55:22.614
[sucks teeth]
We're gonna have to kill her.
