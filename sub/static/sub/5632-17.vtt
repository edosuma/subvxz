00:03.082 --> 00:05.116
911. What is your emergency?

00:05.151 --> 00:06.951
Hello.

00:06.986 --> 00:09.320
My name is Darrell,
and I'm in the woods

00:09.355 --> 00:12.089
off the...
Route 301 near Bensley.

00:12.125 --> 00:15.926
And I'm out here, 'cause I went
to take to pee, bad,

00:15.962 --> 00:17.928
and I think I found a dead body.

00:17.964 --> 00:19.297
Sir, prank phone calls to 911

00:19.332 --> 00:20.564
are punishable
under Virginia law.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.799
No, not a joke.

00:21.834 --> 00:23.501
I really think
I may have found a body.

00:23.536 --> 00:25.069
What do you mean
you <i>may</i> have found?

00:25.104 --> 00:26.070
Oh, man...

00:26.105 --> 00:27.371
Is it a body or not?

00:27.407 --> 00:28.739
I don't want
to look at it again.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:37.450 --> 00:40.017
Oh, yeah,
it's-it's definitely a body.

00:40.053 --> 00:43.621
And it's in acid or something
and it's horrible.

00:43.656 --> 00:45.956
Oh, God, I got,
I got to have some more beer.

00:45.992 --> 00:47.858
Please, sir,
do not have another beer.

00:47.894 --> 00:49.827
Sounds like you've had enough.

00:51.631 --> 00:52.763
Sir?

00:52.799 --> 00:53.864
Oh, no.

00:53.900 --> 00:54.999
Sir?

00:55.034 --> 00:56.100
I hear something.

00:56.135 --> 00:57.435
Sir?
It's the killer.

00:57.470 --> 00:59.403
Oh, he's still here.

00:59.439 --> 01:00.771
Sir, I need you to calm down.

01:00.807 --> 01:03.274
I can't.

01:03.309 --> 01:04.941
I'm sor-- I'm sorry.

01:04.977 --> 01:07.345
I got to get out of here.

01:09.649 --> 01:11.716
Sir? Sir?

01:11.751 --> 01:13.417
We have traced your call.

01:13.453 --> 01:15.019
Officers have been dispatched.

01:15.054 --> 01:16.754
They will be there
in two minutes.

01:16.789 --> 01:19.056
Please don't drink any more.

01:27.934 --> 01:29.734
Bones, what are you doing up?

01:29.769 --> 01:31.469
It's, like, the middle
of the night.

01:31.504 --> 01:33.270
You're sick.
You should be back in bed.

01:33.306 --> 01:34.338
In a minute.

01:34.374 --> 01:37.141
First, I need to drink
this herbal remedy.

01:37.176 --> 01:41.245
It's a tea made from
ginger, fennel and anise.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.080
Certainly smells like that.

01:43.116 --> 01:45.383
Booth, I said "anise,"
not "anus."

01:45.418 --> 01:46.817
Smells like the other end, too.

01:46.853 --> 01:48.719
What about you? You feeling
the onset of any symptoms?

01:48.755 --> 01:51.555
Me? No, I'm fine. I'm fit
as a fiddle. You know me.

01:51.591 --> 01:53.657
Okay, I-I don't understand
how that's possible.

01:53.693 --> 01:55.626
You should be
sick, too.

01:55.661 --> 01:57.728
Compared to my diet,
yours is abhorrent.

01:57.764 --> 02:00.297
You eat nothing but meat,
cheese and bread.

02:00.333 --> 02:02.573
Sugar. You forgot the sugar.
And my beer. I love my beer.

02:02.602 --> 02:05.970
All of which promote
an inflammatory response.

02:06.005 --> 02:08.271
Oh, you got to be--

02:08.306 --> 02:09.607
Not now. Already?

02:09.642 --> 02:11.275
I take it that's work?

02:11.310 --> 02:13.344
Looks like they found a body
in the woods outside Richmond.

02:13.379 --> 02:15.780
They're bringing it back to the
lab with a potential witness.

02:15.815 --> 02:17.715
You should go.
I can take care of myself.

02:17.750 --> 02:19.083
Nope. No, no.

02:19.118 --> 02:21.152
I'll get Aubrey on it.
He can go to the lab.

02:21.187 --> 02:22.620
I got to take care of you.
Come on.

02:22.655 --> 02:23.655
Let's get back to bed.

02:23.689 --> 02:25.456
Bring your anus tea
or whatever.

02:25.491 --> 02:26.891
I'm sorry, what is that?
Smell tea.

02:26.926 --> 02:29.093
Anise.
Ooh, that stinks.

02:29.128 --> 02:30.428
I know you like it.

02:30.463 --> 02:32.296
Ah!

02:32.331 --> 02:34.799
I understand
we have a witness?

02:34.834 --> 02:36.133
Not really.

02:36.169 --> 02:37.635
He was pretty intoxicated.

02:37.670 --> 02:40.604
He claims he was hit
by a pair of masked assailants,

02:40.640 --> 02:43.040
who swung matching shovels
at the exact same time.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.775
Oh, so he was seeing
double, right?

02:44.811 --> 02:46.544
You talking about
our witless witness?

02:46.579 --> 02:48.012
The good news is
I was able to pull

02:48.047 --> 02:49.680
particulates out of
his head wound.

02:49.715 --> 02:51.315
So maybe he won't be
a complete waste.

02:51.350 --> 02:53.714
Aubrey, do me a favor.
Can you grab a zipper?

02:53.715 --> 02:54.387
Oh.

02:54.411 --> 02:55.754
Uh...
what are you doing?

02:55.755 --> 02:57.121
You're starting without Dr. B?

02:57.156 --> 02:59.690
Booth is taking care of her.
She's at home sick.

02:59.725 --> 03:00.791
Mm-hmm.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.467
Wow, okay.

03:09.502 --> 03:11.735
Now I know how she feels.
Pretty awful, huh?

03:11.771 --> 03:14.705
Looks like this guy
took a bath in toxic waste.

03:14.740 --> 03:16.874
Well, what the killer actually
used was muriatic acid.

03:16.909 --> 03:19.977
Local PD was smart enough to
neutralize it with baking soda.

03:20.012 --> 03:22.913
Another couple hours, and he
would've completely dissolved.

03:22.949 --> 03:24.114
It's lucky for us.

03:24.150 --> 03:25.282
Yeah.

03:25.318 --> 03:27.151
Feeling pretty fortunate
right now.

03:27.186 --> 03:31.155
Well, it doesn't look like there
are any internal organs left.

03:31.190 --> 03:32.756
Oh, but...

03:34.193 --> 03:36.026
...take a look at this.

03:36.062 --> 03:37.962
What is that,
some kind of heart monitor?

03:37.997 --> 03:39.163
I don't think so.

03:39.198 --> 03:41.432
It looks like
a wrist microphone clip.

03:41.467 --> 03:42.700
It's government issue.

03:42.735 --> 03:44.602
It's the kind
the Secret Service use.

03:44.637 --> 03:46.303
Seriously, like,
<i>the</i> Secret Service?

03:46.339 --> 03:48.672
The people that
protect the president?

03:54.647 --> 03:58.516
Looks like one of their own
was just murdered.

Walker with the Secret Service.

04:38.956 --> 04:40.622
Seeley Booth,
I've heard a lot about you.

04:40.658 --> 04:42.958
It's an honor to meet you.

04:42.993 --> 04:45.561
Only active agent to ever take
a bullet for the president.

04:45.596 --> 04:47.396
Yeah, yeah, still got
a souvenir in the old leg,

04:47.431 --> 04:49.398
but that...
that was a long time ago.

04:49.433 --> 04:50.933
Well, I'm sorry we're meeting
under these circumstances.

04:50.968 --> 04:52.634
You hear anything from the lab?

04:52.670 --> 04:54.236
Still waiting
on an official I.D.,

04:54.271 --> 04:56.271
but all signs point to this
being one of your guys.

04:56.307 --> 04:58.874
Graham, uh, Roberts.

04:58.909 --> 05:00.409
He was head of my tactical team.

05:00.444 --> 05:02.578
When was the last time
you heard from him?

05:02.613 --> 05:05.013
Last night around 8:00, he
texted to say he needed to talk.

05:05.049 --> 05:07.149
And I texted back,
but when he didn't answer,

05:07.184 --> 05:09.218
I knew something was off.

05:09.253 --> 05:10.886
His body was found
just outside of Richmond.

05:10.921 --> 05:12.888
What was your team doing
that far out of D.C.?

05:12.923 --> 05:14.963
Well, the president has
a campaign fund-raiser there

05:14.992 --> 05:16.325
in 36 hours.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.026
It's just a hop,
jump and a skip away,

05:18.062 --> 05:19.595
but still we sent
an advance team.

05:19.630 --> 05:21.230
Any chance the president's
gonna cancel?

05:21.265 --> 05:22.798
No, not while
on the campaign trail.

05:22.833 --> 05:24.566
Not with the polling so close.

05:24.602 --> 05:26.134
Well, it is, of course, possible
that Agent Robert's death

05:26.170 --> 05:28.103
had nothing to do
with the president.

05:28.138 --> 05:29.872
I'll start doing some digging
into his personal life.

05:29.907 --> 05:31.106
Well, hold your horses.

05:31.141 --> 05:33.208
Now, before <i>we</i> do anything,
I still need approval

05:33.244 --> 05:35.611
from on high that both of you
are cleared to work this.

05:35.646 --> 05:37.145
Look, if you need someone
to vouch for Aubrey,

05:37.181 --> 05:38.347
he's the best around.

05:38.382 --> 05:40.215
Aubrey's not the problem.

05:41.085 --> 05:42.351
Strange as it sounds,

05:42.386 --> 05:43.852
concerns have come up
about your heritage.

05:43.888 --> 05:46.955
What?

05:46.991 --> 05:48.624
What are you talking about?

05:48.659 --> 05:50.592
There are those who are
unsure that a descendent

05:50.628 --> 05:52.961
of John Wilkes Booth
should be working this case.

05:58.302 --> 06:00.802
Very good. Now can you
position the camera

06:00.838 --> 06:03.305
closer to the distal end
of the right femur?

06:03.340 --> 06:05.674
Oh, interesting.

06:05.709 --> 06:07.709
Remodeling suggests
a compound fracture

06:07.745 --> 06:09.311
due to shrapnel,

06:09.346 --> 06:10.846
perhaps caused by an IED.

06:10.881 --> 06:12.814
Do we have the victim's
medical records?

06:12.850 --> 06:15.984
No, not yet,
but they should be here soon.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.552
Along with
the forensic anthropologist

06:17.588 --> 06:19.221
the Secret Service is sending.

06:19.256 --> 06:20.355
What? Why would they do that?

06:20.391 --> 06:22.824
I-I may be sick,
but even infirmed,

06:22.860 --> 06:25.627
I don't know
who could be more capable...

06:25.663 --> 06:29.097
Oh, I can think of one person.

06:29.133 --> 06:31.533
Oh, my God. Fisher!

06:31.568 --> 06:32.935
It's been years.

06:32.970 --> 06:34.102
Where have you been?

06:34.138 --> 06:35.704
Well, wouldn't you like to know?

06:35.739 --> 06:37.172
Mr. Fisher,

06:37.207 --> 06:39.975
you're the expert
assigned to this case?

06:40.010 --> 06:41.109
Yes.

06:41.145 --> 06:42.511
Yes, I am.

06:42.546 --> 06:44.613
And it's Dr. Fisher now,
if you will.

06:44.648 --> 06:45.948
And I insist you do.

06:45.983 --> 06:47.115
So, what?

06:47.151 --> 06:48.817
You completed your PhD,

06:48.852 --> 06:51.019
and you're working
with the Secret Service?

06:51.055 --> 06:52.654
Well, I-I consult with them.

06:52.690 --> 06:54.823
Yes, I'm on loan
from another organization.

06:54.858 --> 06:55.958
No way!

06:55.993 --> 06:57.192
The CIA?

06:57.227 --> 06:58.427
Or, um, Homeland Security?

06:58.462 --> 07:00.429
Well, I'm afraid
it's classified.

07:00.464 --> 07:03.899
But what I can tell you
is that I travel extensively,

07:03.934 --> 07:07.536
and I'm always surrounded
by young, nubile women.

07:07.571 --> 07:09.004
I wish I could
tell you more,

07:09.039 --> 07:12.874
but I am just not
at liberty to do so, so...

07:12.910 --> 07:13.976
Well, we get it.

07:14.011 --> 07:17.779
It's all very mysterious
and kind of sexy.

07:17.815 --> 07:19.781
I'd like to think so, yes.

07:19.817 --> 07:20.916
Dr. Fisher,

07:20.951 --> 07:22.884
we are wasting valuable time!

07:22.920 --> 07:25.787
I need to know, did the victim
have reconstructive surgery

07:25.823 --> 07:27.589
on his right femur

07:27.624 --> 07:28.590
after an IED explosion?

07:28.625 --> 07:30.459
Yes, let me see here.

07:31.729 --> 07:34.296
By comparing the X-ray

07:34.331 --> 07:37.366
of Graham Roberts'
medical files to your own,

07:37.401 --> 07:39.401
the injuries show
matching characteristics

07:39.436 --> 07:41.236
consistent with shrapnel.

07:41.271 --> 07:44.373
Therefore, this is
indeed Agent Roberts.

07:44.408 --> 07:46.074
Good work, Dr. Fisher.

07:46.110 --> 07:47.509
Yes, very well done.

07:47.544 --> 07:51.546
But I am afraid
that you have wasted your time

07:51.582 --> 07:53.015
coming down to the lab.

07:53.050 --> 07:57.019
I am quite confident
I am feeling better now.

07:57.054 --> 07:59.354
And I no longer...

07:59.390 --> 08:01.923
I no longer need... Oh.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.792
Ex...

08:07.498 --> 08:09.331
Wow.

08:09.366 --> 08:12.367
Dr. Brennan,
based on the viscosity

08:12.403 --> 08:14.603
and color of your discharge,
it's clear

08:14.638 --> 08:16.104
that you're still contagious.

08:16.140 --> 08:19.474
Not to worry; your lab
is in very good hands.

08:19.510 --> 08:21.143
Mine.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.817
<i>Agent Aubrey, this is</i>

08:28.852 --> 08:30.218
Agent Patel.

08:30.254 --> 08:32.187
She will be your liaison
in the investigation.

08:32.222 --> 08:33.789
Walker brought me up to speed.

08:33.823 --> 08:35.123
What's our next step?

08:35.159 --> 08:37.292
I take it you worked
alongside Agent Roberts?

08:37.327 --> 08:40.128
Yes, he joined the advance team
about three years ago.

08:40.164 --> 08:41.630
Then I'm guessing
you have a good idea

08:41.664 --> 08:43.532
of what was going on
in his personal life.

08:43.567 --> 08:45.634
I don't think he really had one.

08:45.669 --> 08:47.402
Certainly not a wife
or girlfriend.

08:47.438 --> 08:48.770
Okay, and what exactly

08:48.806 --> 08:50.972
was his role in protecting
the president?

08:51.008 --> 08:52.908
Half of us work
on securing every square foot

08:52.943 --> 08:54.910
that the president
will cover on his visit.

08:54.945 --> 08:56.545
And then the tactical unit
investigates

08:56.580 --> 08:58.146
all credible threats
to the president

08:58.182 --> 08:59.614
within a hundred-mile radius.

08:59.650 --> 09:01.583
Now, these are
the case files of

09:01.618 --> 09:04.319
all the persons of interest
that Roberts was assigned.

09:04.354 --> 09:06.388
He met with each of them
personally yesterday.

09:06.423 --> 09:09.825
So, it's possible
that one of these guys

09:09.860 --> 09:11.827
not only killed your agent...

09:11.862 --> 09:15.330
But that same person may also
be targeting the president.

09:21.205 --> 09:23.205
Well, Dr. Hodgins.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.740
Greetings and salutations.

09:25.776 --> 09:27.509
No way, Fisher!

09:27.544 --> 09:29.611
What are you doing here?

09:29.646 --> 09:31.313
Consulting for
the Secret Service,

09:31.348 --> 09:33.081
leading in
Dr. Brennan's absence.

09:33.117 --> 09:34.349
Typical man of action stuff.

09:34.384 --> 09:35.917
Wow!

09:35.953 --> 09:38.720
I see Angela wasn't joking
about you being paralyzed.

09:38.755 --> 09:40.222
Uh, no.

09:40.257 --> 09:42.290
No, not-not a joke.

09:42.326 --> 09:46.261
Just a lot of pain,
misery and self-loathing.

09:46.296 --> 09:48.663
Feelings in which
I'm very well-versed.

09:48.699 --> 09:49.699
I do remember.

09:49.733 --> 09:51.500
Fisher, this is

09:51.535 --> 09:52.734
so awesome to see you.

09:52.769 --> 09:53.869
I should probably get

09:53.904 --> 09:55.137
back to my analysis.

09:55.172 --> 09:56.371
Actually, that's
why I stopped by.

09:56.406 --> 09:57.606
I wanted to check up
on your progress

09:57.641 --> 09:59.074
while the bones
are being cleaned.

09:59.109 --> 10:01.443
Yeah, sure. I mean,
there isn't much so far.

10:01.478 --> 10:03.378
We got this photo
that the attending EMTs

10:03.413 --> 10:04.746
took of our witness's face.

10:04.781 --> 10:07.015
See that L-shaped gash?

10:07.050 --> 10:09.518
That's a match
to a square point shovel.

10:09.553 --> 10:11.319
Unfortunately, square point
shovels are pretty commonplace,

10:11.355 --> 10:13.455
so that clue gets us nowhere.

10:13.490 --> 10:15.290
Exactly, but I also found
something probative

10:15.325 --> 10:16.525
on the victim's shoe.

10:16.560 --> 10:19.494
In the treads, I found
macro-nutrients.

10:19.530 --> 10:21.596
Specifically, nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium--

10:21.632 --> 10:24.466
aka fertilizer--
also muriatic acid,

10:24.501 --> 10:26.768
which is sometimes used
in cleaning

10:26.803 --> 10:28.103
garden sculptures.

10:28.138 --> 10:29.905
Add that to the shovel,
and it sounds like

10:29.940 --> 10:31.706
our killer might've been
in landscaping.

10:31.742 --> 10:35.277
It's a stretch, but, hey,
it's all I've got.

10:38.081 --> 10:40.248
<i>Neil Stockton owns</i>
<i>a landscaping company,</i>

10:40.284 --> 10:41.783
divorced with kids, no custody.

10:41.818 --> 10:43.585
More importantly,
he's one of the threats

10:43.620 --> 10:45.420
that Agent Roberts
met with yesterday.

10:45.455 --> 10:47.389
Yeah, correct.
His last scheduled visit.

10:47.424 --> 10:49.524
Probably the last person
to see him alive.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.226
So what kind of threats
we talking about here?

10:51.261 --> 10:53.228
Well, most of Stockton's
attacks came on Twitter.

10:53.263 --> 10:55.363
Unfortunately, he never outright
threatened the president.

10:55.399 --> 10:57.632
If he had,
then we could press charges.

10:57.668 --> 11:00.068
Instead, he wrote that "someone"
needs to shoot the president,

11:00.103 --> 11:04.539
so he will, quote, "be tortured
in hell for all of eternity."

11:04.575 --> 11:05.807
Okay.

11:05.842 --> 11:06.808
Yeah.

11:06.843 --> 11:08.777
Can't wait to meet him.

11:11.114 --> 11:13.048
Hello?

11:14.218 --> 11:16.117
Looks like he stepped out.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.119
You seeing anything?

11:21.091 --> 11:22.657
Aubrey, look.

11:42.713 --> 11:45.647
Mr. Stockton, we're with the FBI
and the Secret Service.

11:45.682 --> 11:47.048
We'd like to ask you
some questions.

11:49.464 --> 11:51.965
Take a seat. We need
to ask you a few questions

11:51.966 --> 11:54.244
about Secret Service
Agent Graham Roberts.

11:54.245 --> 11:56.078
You remember
him, don't you, Neil?

11:56.113 --> 11:57.278
He came to see you last night,

11:57.314 --> 11:58.613
about your threats
against the president.

11:58.648 --> 12:00.415
I don't understand.
Where's Agent Roberts at?

12:00.450 --> 12:01.616
That's a good question.

12:01.651 --> 12:03.485
But then, I think you know
the answer, don't you?

12:03.520 --> 12:05.487
Hold on. No.

12:05.522 --> 12:07.088
Uh, you don't think that I...

12:07.124 --> 12:09.290
No, I saw him yesterday.
He came here to see me.

12:09.326 --> 12:11.259
Yeah, we know that much, Neil.
Then what?

12:11.294 --> 12:13.228
Nothing. Told me the president
was coming today

12:13.263 --> 12:15.730
and made it clear he didn't
want to see me around.

12:16.833 --> 12:18.733
Oh, yeah?

12:18.769 --> 12:20.935
What did he have
to say about this?

12:20.971 --> 12:22.837
Neil.

12:22.873 --> 12:23.938
Neil, look at me.

12:23.974 --> 12:25.673
You know what
I think happened?

12:25.709 --> 12:27.809
I think that Robert saw that
you were planning something,

12:27.844 --> 12:29.744
you had no choice
but to get rid of him.

12:29.780 --> 12:32.180
You killed him,
doused him with acid,

12:32.215 --> 12:33.548
and buried him in the woods.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.049
Only thing is
you got interrupted.

12:35.085 --> 12:36.785
That's when you hit our witness
over the head with a shovel,

12:36.820 --> 12:38.486
but I'm sure once he gets
a good look at you...

12:38.522 --> 12:40.722
No. No, that didn't happen.

12:40.757 --> 12:42.724
Look, I can prove it to you,
I swear.

12:42.759 --> 12:43.958
All right,
I've had enough of this.

12:43.994 --> 12:45.493
I'm booking you.
Ah, let it go!

12:45.529 --> 12:46.861
Let me go! God!

12:46.897 --> 12:48.496
What the hell?!

12:48.532 --> 12:50.532
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

12:50.567 --> 12:52.467
I can't lift my
damn shoulders.

12:52.502 --> 12:54.602
Years of digging and
they're both shot to hell.

12:54.638 --> 12:56.771
Expect us to believe that?
You're a landscaper.

12:56.807 --> 12:59.140
I supervise, okay?

12:59.176 --> 13:01.976
I haven't done the work
myself in years.

13:02.012 --> 13:04.145
I couldn't have done this.

13:14.157 --> 13:17.025
Uh, Dr. Brennan,

13:17.060 --> 13:19.994
perhaps we could postpone
this video conference,

13:20.030 --> 13:23.398
as I'm still reassembling
the victim's skull.

13:25.168 --> 13:26.835
Also I couldn't help but notice.

13:26.870 --> 13:29.370
There seems to be
a pirate there with you.

13:29.406 --> 13:33.208
Uh, Angela sent her Reiki healer
to help in my recovery.

13:33.243 --> 13:34.776
Pay no attention to him.

13:34.811 --> 13:37.145
By placing my hand
next to your temple,

13:37.180 --> 13:39.147
I invite the healing
and transcendental energy

13:39.182 --> 13:41.516
to enter your mind.
Please stop talking.

13:41.551 --> 13:44.519
It only highlights the absurdity
of this exercise.

13:44.554 --> 13:48.056
I hate to say it, but you appear
to be rosier of cheek.

13:48.091 --> 13:50.892
Yes, I-I am feeling much better.

13:50.927 --> 13:52.727
However, that is not your doing.

13:52.762 --> 13:54.095
It is much more likely

13:54.130 --> 13:57.365
the B12 injections,
the I.V. line,

13:57.400 --> 13:58.733
and the nasal rinse.

13:58.768 --> 14:00.802
Relax. Relax.
Shh-shh. Shh-shh-shh.

14:00.837 --> 14:04.138
Uh, Mister... Dr. Fisher,
please show me your progress.

14:04.174 --> 14:07.141
Okay, on the sternum,

14:07.177 --> 14:09.510
I found a comminuted fracture,

14:09.546 --> 14:12.947
which suggests the victim was
hit with a blunt force object.

14:12.983 --> 14:14.349
Well, I disagree.

14:14.384 --> 14:15.784
That fracture's
much more indicative

14:15.819 --> 14:18.353
of a gunshot wound to the chest.

14:18.388 --> 14:21.522
Look at the shape
of the indentation.

14:21.558 --> 14:24.192
Uh, it's a pattern I've seen
before in gunshot wounds

14:24.227 --> 14:26.261
when the victim was
wearing a Kevlar vest.

14:26.296 --> 14:27.395
I see.

14:27.430 --> 14:28.897
So the vest stopped the bullet,

14:28.932 --> 14:31.499
but the blast force
still resulted in a fracture.

14:31.534 --> 14:33.868
While this injury's not fatal,

14:33.904 --> 14:38.239
uh, we still should pass on this
finding as soon as possible.

14:38.275 --> 14:40.008
Yeah. I'll go ahead
and make the call.

14:40.043 --> 14:42.143
I can see you're busy.

14:47.784 --> 14:48.716
Agent Booth.

14:48.752 --> 14:50.551
Yep.
The deputy director

14:50.587 --> 14:52.186
of the FBI
has spoken to the president.

14:52.222 --> 14:53.187
You're good to go.

14:53.223 --> 14:54.223
Okay, here we go.

14:54.257 --> 14:55.356
Where's Walker?

14:55.392 --> 14:57.492
Conference room.
All righty.

14:57.527 --> 14:58.726
Give me a sitrep,
will you?

14:58.762 --> 15:00.194
What'd you and
Aubrey find out?

15:00.230 --> 15:02.196
A person of interest
that we met with

15:02.232 --> 15:04.699
may be in the clear because of
a preexisting injury.

15:04.734 --> 15:06.734
Okay, great. Send his, uh,
medical record to the lab.

15:06.770 --> 15:08.536
They'll be able to see
if his injury's legit.

15:08.571 --> 15:10.438
Booth, I just want you to know

15:10.473 --> 15:12.073
it wasn't protocol;
it's just personal.

15:12.108 --> 15:14.409
Uh, you're mixing your words.
You should get some sleep.

15:14.444 --> 15:16.344
Secondly, I really don't care
about getting vetted.

15:16.379 --> 15:17.679
Uh, we got bigger problems.

15:17.714 --> 15:19.514
Lab is saying
that your agent was shot

15:19.549 --> 15:20.949
directly in the sternum.

15:20.984 --> 15:22.917
But the shot wasn't fatal.
The point is

15:22.953 --> 15:24.385
untrained shooters,
nine out of ten times,

15:24.421 --> 15:25.620
they go for the head.

15:25.655 --> 15:26.921
This guy,
he went center mass.

15:26.957 --> 15:29.290
Which means we're looking
for a professional.

15:30.961 --> 15:34.329
Dr. Saroyan, I have something
of note I'd like to show you.

15:34.364 --> 15:36.264
Just a second.

15:36.299 --> 15:38.566
These are Neil Stockton's MRIs,

15:38.601 --> 15:41.069
which confirm the extent of
damage he suffered bilaterally

15:41.104 --> 15:42.837
on the rotator cuffs.

15:42.872 --> 15:44.505
Based on the severity of damage,

15:44.541 --> 15:46.674
I'd say he'd have minimal
shoulder flexion

15:46.710 --> 15:49.110
and little to
no abduction.

15:49.145 --> 15:51.112
Yeah, which means he couldn't
have swung that shovel

15:51.147 --> 15:52.814
hard enough to knock out
the witness.

15:52.849 --> 15:53.781
Mm-mm.

15:53.817 --> 15:55.249
What have you got?

15:55.285 --> 15:57.685
Well, while reassembling
the victim's skull,

15:57.721 --> 16:00.688
I found an embedded fiber,
which I've given to Dr. Hodgins,

16:00.724 --> 16:04.392
and I've determined the
probable point of impact,

16:04.427 --> 16:06.461
a depression fracture
at the cranial vertex.

16:06.496 --> 16:08.229
So he was smashed
on the top of his head

16:08.264 --> 16:09.530
by some kind
of blunt force object.

16:09.566 --> 16:11.432
Not exactly.

16:11.468 --> 16:15.169
I also found circular fractures
around the foramen magnum.

16:15.205 --> 16:17.238
Any idea what caused these?

16:17.273 --> 16:19.607
I'd say a fall
from a great height.

16:19.642 --> 16:24.078
The head impacted first, forcing
the skull against the spine.

16:24.114 --> 16:25.947
How high are we talking?

16:25.982 --> 16:28.049
Best estimate,
I'd say at least 25 meters.

16:28.084 --> 16:30.385
Have you shown this
to Dr. Brennan?

16:30.420 --> 16:32.286
I tried to call,
but she didn't pick up.

16:32.322 --> 16:34.655
Which means she either
relapsed into sickness,

16:34.691 --> 16:37.191
died or is ignoring my calls.

16:37.227 --> 16:40.728
Let's hope she's just
ignoring your calls.

16:40.764 --> 16:43.931
Yes, I suppose that's
the better alternative.

16:47.404 --> 16:49.437
<i>So, Walker, as you can see,</i>

16:49.472 --> 16:51.606
these buildings,
all in the red dots,

16:51.641 --> 16:52.974
are eight-stories high,

16:53.009 --> 16:54.776
within a thousand yards
of the motorcade.

16:54.811 --> 16:56.978
I'll have my men search
these buildings as well.

16:57.013 --> 16:58.146
Well, sir, with
all due respect,

16:58.181 --> 17:00.982
that's about 2,000 yards
away from the motorcade.

17:01.017 --> 17:02.617
There's no line of sight there.

17:02.652 --> 17:04.519
It's not your call, all right?

17:04.554 --> 17:06.554
The president's safety
is my job.

17:08.657 --> 17:10.491
Bones, what are you
doing here?

17:10.527 --> 17:11.959
You must be Dr. Brennan.

17:11.994 --> 17:13.861
Uh, well, I was told
that you were sick.

17:13.896 --> 17:14.996
You sure you should be here?

17:15.031 --> 17:16.364
Of course.

17:16.398 --> 17:18.833
Uh, here, look at my sputum.
It's clear.

17:18.867 --> 17:21.002
There's no sign
of infection.

17:21.037 --> 17:22.502
Bones, he doesn't want
to see your sputum.

17:22.539 --> 17:24.172
Just put
the Kleenex away.

17:24.207 --> 17:25.205
Can you excuse us
for a second?

17:25.241 --> 17:26.540
Uh, of course.

17:26.576 --> 17:27.675
Bones, what are
you doing here?

17:27.710 --> 17:28.776
Well, I'm here
to help, Booth.

17:28.812 --> 17:29.911
No, you're sick.

17:29.946 --> 17:32.246
No, no... I'm f...

17:33.316 --> 17:34.715
Uh, look.

17:34.751 --> 17:36.417
I'm not contagious. It's clear.

17:36.453 --> 17:39.053
Can you just put
the snot rag away for now?

17:39.089 --> 17:41.022
Look, I appreciate what
you're doing, I really do,

17:41.057 --> 17:43.224
but, you know what, just go
back to the lab or something.

17:43.259 --> 17:44.225
I can't.

17:44.260 --> 17:46.027
While I'm not contagious,

17:46.062 --> 17:48.129
there's still a risk
I could contaminate evidence.

17:48.164 --> 17:50.765
Booth, please, I can't
sit around and wait.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.700
I need to find a way I can help.

17:52.735 --> 17:54.569
Okay, I got a hunch.
Come with me.

17:58.613 --> 18:00.279
<i>Ah, come on.</i>

18:00.315 --> 18:01.581
I thought you said
you were better.

18:01.616 --> 18:03.383
Uh, no, I said
I was not contagious.

18:03.418 --> 18:04.550
There's a difference.

18:04.586 --> 18:06.552
Okay, you know what, this is
crazy. You should be home.

18:06.588 --> 18:08.121
No, I disagree.

18:08.156 --> 18:10.957
You and I often do our best
when working together.

18:10.992 --> 18:13.793
Also... I wanted to see
how you were feeling.

18:13.828 --> 18:15.595
Me? I'm fine.

18:15.630 --> 18:17.530
Unlike you,
who are sick.

18:17.565 --> 18:20.933
I wasn't referring
to your physical well-being.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.935
Aubrey told me that
you were initially blocked

18:22.971 --> 18:24.704
from the case
because of being

18:24.739 --> 18:26.472
of relation
to John Wilkes Booth.

18:26.508 --> 18:27.907
Okay, you know what,
it's nothing, okay?

18:27.942 --> 18:29.709
What some nutcase
relative of mine did

18:29.744 --> 18:32.612
a hundred-plus years ago has
nothing to do with me, Bones.

18:34.182 --> 18:36.115
That's Walker.
See if he's got anything.

18:36.151 --> 18:37.283
You got something?

18:37.318 --> 18:38.684
No. My team searched

18:38.720 --> 18:40.019
each and every building
we tagged.

18:40.055 --> 18:42.088
We got nothing.
Where are you at?

18:42.123 --> 18:44.724
Booth believes that our best bet
is to visit the local gun range.

18:44.759 --> 18:46.859
Right, whoever our guy is,
he knows

18:46.895 --> 18:48.861
he's only gonna get one
shot before he's taken out.

18:48.897 --> 18:51.397
Which means
he's probably practicing.

18:51.433 --> 18:53.166
I'll get back to you.

18:53.201 --> 18:55.068
Do you need... do you need
me to pull over?

18:55.103 --> 18:56.436
No, I'm fine.

19:03.111 --> 19:05.711
So you're looking for someone
who's a hell of a shot.

19:05.747 --> 19:07.580
Yeah, somebody who's been
out here a lot.

19:07.615 --> 19:09.649
Uh, perhaps someone
with military experience.

19:09.684 --> 19:12.585
Someone who has spoken out
against the president.

19:12.620 --> 19:14.787
Mm. Sounds like
you're looking for Roger.

19:14.823 --> 19:17.890
Served in
Desert Storm.

19:17.926 --> 19:20.093
Didn't come
back right.

19:20.128 --> 19:22.295
He'll tell you all about it.

19:36.377 --> 19:37.743
Ma'am, please, control yourself.

19:37.779 --> 19:39.345
You're distracting my customers.

19:39.380 --> 19:42.248
I'm sorry, but it's not
healthy to suppress

19:42.283 --> 19:43.649
a post-infectious cough.

20:00.468 --> 20:01.801
Better.

20:01.836 --> 20:03.936
So glad to hear it.

20:03.972 --> 20:05.705
Excuse me, ma'am,
what about that kid?

20:05.740 --> 20:06.839
Who?

20:06.875 --> 20:08.674
Oh, Travis?
Hmm, I suppose so.

20:08.710 --> 20:11.410
He has been around
a lot recently.

20:11.446 --> 20:13.246
And he certainly
holds a grudge.

20:13.281 --> 20:15.681
Only thing is
he's a terrible shot.

20:15.717 --> 20:18.684
Booth, she's right.
He hasn't hit his target once.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.686
That's because he hasn't
been aiming for the target.

20:20.722 --> 20:22.355
He's been hitting
that tree

20:22.390 --> 20:24.090
about a hundred yards behind it.

20:24.125 --> 20:26.359
He's been hitting
all those leaves.

20:26.394 --> 20:28.761
He hasn't missed one yet.

20:35.170 --> 20:36.602
Lieutenant Travis Bozwell,
that's you, right?

20:36.638 --> 20:39.472
What do you want?

20:39.507 --> 20:41.941
This inquiry is related to an
ongoing murder investigation.

20:41.976 --> 20:43.910
Just need to know
why you've been spending

20:43.945 --> 20:46.212
so much time here
at the range recently.

20:46.247 --> 20:47.613
I don't know.

20:47.649 --> 20:48.981
I guess since I've been back,

20:49.017 --> 20:50.850
this is the only place
that makes sense.

20:50.885 --> 20:52.718
According to these files,

20:52.754 --> 20:54.654
you're pretty outspoken
towards the president.

20:54.689 --> 20:56.689
Look, all I said
was he didn't serve.

20:56.724 --> 20:58.224
And unless you serve,

20:58.259 --> 21:00.826
you shouldn't be allowed
to send others off to die.

21:03.331 --> 21:05.531
Travis, I know how you feel.

21:05.567 --> 21:06.966
All right? I served.

21:07.001 --> 21:08.768
I was a Ranger.

21:08.803 --> 21:12.238
I saw things that...
that still stay with me.

21:14.676 --> 21:17.376
But it gets better.

21:20.381 --> 21:21.847
Look, can I go?

21:21.883 --> 21:24.183
No. We need to know
where you were last night.

21:24.219 --> 21:26.319
Specifically between
8:00 p.m. and midnight.

21:26.354 --> 21:27.587
Nowhere.

21:27.622 --> 21:29.555
I was home.
All right.

21:29.591 --> 21:32.458
Fine. Look, we're still gonna
have to hold you for 24 hours.

21:32.493 --> 21:34.627
What... Twenty-f...?

21:36.531 --> 21:38.331
Fine.

21:38.366 --> 21:40.600
I got nothing
to go back to anyway.

21:49.777 --> 21:52.178
You found something,
Mr. Fisher?

21:54.315 --> 21:55.448
Doctor.

21:55.483 --> 21:57.550
Sorry. Habit.

21:57.585 --> 21:59.418
What have you found, Dr. Fisher?

21:59.454 --> 22:01.487
Well, Dr. Saroyan, I-I found

22:01.522 --> 22:04.357
bilateral inferior
dislocations

22:04.392 --> 22:07.326
as well as crushing
microfractures

22:07.362 --> 22:08.894
on the humeral heads

22:08.930 --> 22:11.797
and along the inferior margins
of the glenoid fossae...

22:11.833 --> 22:13.633
Stop. Remember your audience.

22:13.668 --> 22:14.834
Not Dr. Brennan.

22:14.869 --> 22:16.335
Right.

22:16.371 --> 22:17.837
Damage to the shoulders
suggests the victim

22:17.872 --> 22:19.805
was forced into
a confined space

22:19.841 --> 22:21.774
after he was killed.
Hmm.

22:21.809 --> 22:23.542
Any idea what kind of space
we're talking about?

22:23.578 --> 22:24.578
No.

22:24.612 --> 22:26.279
None whatsoever, but thank you

22:26.314 --> 22:28.681
for pointing out
the inadequacies of my work.

22:29.851 --> 22:31.684
Dr. Fisher, take a break.

22:31.719 --> 22:34.720
I'll see if Angela
can make sense of all of this.

22:34.756 --> 22:37.857
Sure. Whatever.

22:48.269 --> 22:51.037
So the victim's shoulders
were crunched postmortem,

22:51.072 --> 22:52.471
but nothing else?

22:52.507 --> 22:55.458
No. No damage to the hips,
knees or ankles.

22:55.493 --> 22:57.526
Okay. So that means
whatever he was shoved into

22:57.562 --> 23:00.696
was not only very narrow,
but it was also very long.

23:00.732 --> 23:02.231
Hey, so I got the results
from the fiber

23:02.266 --> 23:03.599
Fisher found embedded
in the victim's skull.

23:03.634 --> 23:06.302
It's a two-ply
mercerized cotton.

23:06.337 --> 23:08.404
Sounds like
a high-quality bedsheet.

23:08.439 --> 23:10.272
Yeah. It's also an exact match
for the sheets

23:10.308 --> 23:12.008
at the hotel
where the victim was staying.

23:12.043 --> 23:14.176
Hold on. Do you have a theory
about something?

23:14.212 --> 23:16.479
Yeah, I do.
Look, we know that the fiber

23:16.514 --> 23:18.347
was embedded
in the skull, right?

23:18.383 --> 23:19.849
It-It's very likely
that the sheet

23:19.884 --> 23:21.851
was wrapped around the victim
before impact.

23:21.886 --> 23:23.719
No, I'm not buying.

23:23.755 --> 23:25.721
If he was wrapped
in his own sheet,

23:25.757 --> 23:28.457
you're saying the killer
murdered a Secret Service agent

23:28.493 --> 23:30.192
in a hotel
crawling with agents.

23:30.228 --> 23:31.694
Yeah.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

23:31.729 --> 23:33.129
Angie, I sent you
an e-mail with some photos.

23:33.164 --> 23:34.397
Can you pull that up?

23:34.432 --> 23:36.132
All right.
What are we looking at?

23:36.167 --> 23:37.266
Right,
so this first picture here

23:37.301 --> 23:38.567
is of the victim's
hotel room.

23:38.603 --> 23:40.536
Now, you can see
that it's down the hall

23:40.571 --> 23:42.872
from the fire exit
and the elevators.

23:42.907 --> 23:45.274
That's a long way to drag a body
without anyone noticing.

23:45.309 --> 23:46.976
Exactly.
And we know that the killer

23:47.011 --> 23:48.778
didn't use the elevators
or the stairs.

23:48.813 --> 23:51.180
Now, can you also call up this,
uh, bottom photo from...

23:51.215 --> 23:52.215
two from the left.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.716
Right there. Yeah.

23:53.751 --> 23:55.851
You think he was
pushed down the chute?

23:55.887 --> 23:57.920
It was directly across
from his room.

23:57.955 --> 23:59.455
Wait, I think Hodgins
is onto something.

23:59.490 --> 24:00.856
Take a look.

24:04.462 --> 24:05.928
That explains the postmortem
shoulder injuries.

24:05.963 --> 24:07.196
And the bedsheet.

24:07.231 --> 24:09.265
And the fall of 25 meters.

24:09.300 --> 24:11.133
One problem: whoever did this

24:11.169 --> 24:13.436
would need to know
every inch of that hotel

24:13.471 --> 24:15.337
and every move
the Secret Service made.

24:15.373 --> 24:17.106
You're right.

24:17.141 --> 24:19.809
Which means we're most likely
looking at an inside job.

24:19.844 --> 24:22.812
Another agent
within the Secret Service.

24:29.551 --> 24:30.984
<i>Aubrey, what's going on here?</i>

24:31.019 --> 24:32.986
Agent Patel, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

24:33.021 --> 24:34.955
Agent Roberts' room
is now a crime scene,

24:34.990 --> 24:37.524
and this is a closed
investigation-- FBI only.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.526
You think someone
on our team killed him.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.695
Aubrey, come on,
I can help.

24:41.730 --> 24:44.130
I know this team
better than anyone.

24:44.166 --> 24:45.498
As soon as I have something,

24:45.534 --> 24:48.602
I'll let you know
as much as I can.

24:54.643 --> 24:55.842
Ouch.

24:55.877 --> 24:57.877
She doesn't seem too happy.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.512
So, have we got anything

24:59.548 --> 25:01.815
or did I just piss off
the Secret Service for nothing?

25:01.850 --> 25:03.917
Sorry, brother, but I am not
finding anything in here.

25:03.952 --> 25:06.119
But our guys did
find muriatic acid

25:06.154 --> 25:07.954
in the pool maintenance room,

25:07.990 --> 25:10.457
and the groundkeeper said that
he was missing a shovel, so...

25:10.492 --> 25:12.158
You got anything?

25:12.194 --> 25:14.427
Uh, no blood evidence
in the bathroom.

25:14.463 --> 25:16.696
Also, no trace of it on the top

25:16.732 --> 25:18.898
or the bottom of
the laundry chute.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.700
But we did find bleach,
which could be proof

25:20.736 --> 25:22.002
that blood was cleaned up.

25:22.037 --> 25:23.270
Right. Or it could be there

25:23.305 --> 25:24.537
because it's a laundry room.

25:24.573 --> 25:27.240
So, in other words,
we have no evidence

25:27.276 --> 25:29.342
of foul play whatsoever.
Hold on a second.

25:29.378 --> 25:31.845
We know that there's no evidence
at the top of the chute,

25:31.880 --> 25:34.481
we know that there's no evidence
at the bottom of the chute,

25:34.516 --> 25:37.317
but we're pretty confident that
the victim was <i>in</i> the chute.

25:37.352 --> 25:39.919
Oh, no. I have a bad feeling
I know where this is going.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.522
Cam, I got to go in that chute.

25:42.557 --> 25:44.324
No. Look, I agree that
we should investigate,

25:44.359 --> 25:46.960
but maybe we send someone else;
like Aubrey...

25:46.995 --> 25:48.228
What?

25:48.263 --> 25:49.496
...should go.

25:49.531 --> 25:51.164
Okay.

25:51.199 --> 25:52.932
I'm not really a fan of heights

25:52.968 --> 25:54.734
or small spaces,

25:54.770 --> 25:57.437
but two negatives
make a positive, right?

25:57.472 --> 25:59.873
Come-- Cam, it makes
more sense that I go.

25:59.908 --> 26:02.008
First of all,
my shoulders are more narrow

26:02.044 --> 26:03.877
than Aubrey's, okay?

26:03.912 --> 26:05.412
I-I also know what
I'm looking for.

26:05.447 --> 26:06.846
And this is the one situation

26:06.882 --> 26:08.748
where you don't need
working legs.

26:08.784 --> 26:12.118
Okay. Enough. I...

26:12.154 --> 26:15.488
Any other case, and I'd say
not a snowball's chance in hell,

26:15.524 --> 26:17.691
but given the circumstance...

26:21.229 --> 26:22.962
What do you need?

26:25.967 --> 26:28.034
Booth, you son of a bitch!

26:28.070 --> 26:29.469
Slow down.
I need you to calm down.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.905
A closed investigation?!
Calm down.

26:31.940 --> 26:32.972
Now, what the hell
are you trying to prove?!

26:33.008 --> 26:34.274
Look, this isn't
about me or you.

26:34.309 --> 26:35.642
Do you understand me?

26:35.677 --> 26:37.077
I am just going
where this case leads me.

26:37.112 --> 26:38.445
And right now, I need to meet

26:38.480 --> 26:39.846
with every agent
in your advance team.

26:39.881 --> 26:41.114
No. Not possible.

26:41.149 --> 26:42.315
POTUS flies in an hour.

26:42.351 --> 26:43.383
We got three hours.

26:43.418 --> 26:44.984
Do not question me! You hear?!

26:45.020 --> 26:46.986
Listen to me, all I'm saying
is we get a schedule together.

26:47.022 --> 26:49.823
We get the agents in and we get
them out as quickly as we can.

26:49.858 --> 26:52.225
Booth, I swear to God,
if something happens...

26:52.260 --> 26:54.294
Nothing is going to happen.
All right?

26:54.329 --> 26:56.129
But I need to know for sure.

26:56.164 --> 26:58.498
So go and gather your team.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.075
Okay, this is totally insane.

27:09.111 --> 27:10.377
Relax, Cam, come on, now.

27:10.412 --> 27:11.978
The tech-- he drilled

27:12.013 --> 27:14.981
12 0.9-class screws into
this thing, and look at this.

27:15.016 --> 27:17.851
16 gauge impacted
aluminized steel.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.619
- That thing's gonna hold.
- Wow.

27:19.654 --> 27:21.921
I am so glad that it's you
in there instead of me.

27:21.957 --> 27:23.256
The feeling is mutual, Aubrey.

27:23.291 --> 27:24.731
Okay, so let's go over
the game plan.

27:24.760 --> 27:25.892
I want you in
and out of there

27:25.927 --> 27:27.727
as quick as possible.
I got it.

27:27.763 --> 27:29.195
I'm gonna go down,
I'm gonna swab, I'm gonna bag,

27:29.231 --> 27:30.397
I'm gonna get
the hell out of there.

27:30.432 --> 27:31.464
What about Angela?

27:31.500 --> 27:32.999
Should we call her
before we do this?

27:33.034 --> 27:34.401
No.
No.

27:35.904 --> 27:38.271
Okay. Good luck.

27:46.882 --> 27:49.682
Is that a scan
of the victim's skull?

27:49.718 --> 27:51.017
Hey, you're here!

27:51.052 --> 27:52.619
You look great.

27:52.654 --> 27:54.888
I told you that my Reiki
healer was a miracle worker.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.389
Your healer is a fraud.

27:56.425 --> 27:59.526
His "work" was just one
of several remedies

27:59.561 --> 28:01.461
I tried simultaneously.

28:01.496 --> 28:04.097
There is no evidence
that it had any effect.

28:04.132 --> 28:05.532
Okay.

28:05.567 --> 28:08.101
He told me you asked him
to stay for an extra hour.

28:08.136 --> 28:09.369
Well...

28:09.404 --> 28:11.704
I was clearly
delirious with fever.

28:11.740 --> 28:12.939
Right.

28:12.974 --> 28:14.374
Sure, sweetie.

28:14.409 --> 28:17.610
What is the simulation
you're working on?

28:17.646 --> 28:20.480
The fall down the laundry chute.

28:20.515 --> 28:22.015
I-I took a scan of
the victim's skull,

28:22.050 --> 28:23.550
but the problem
I'm having

28:23.585 --> 28:25.885
is no matter how
I have the victim land,

28:25.921 --> 28:27.587
the result never matches

28:27.622 --> 28:29.489
the fracture pattern
that Fisher found.

28:29.524 --> 28:30.824
I see.

28:30.859 --> 28:33.593
So either the victim
did not fall down the chute,

28:33.628 --> 28:35.662
or...

28:35.697 --> 28:37.564
Or what?

28:37.599 --> 28:41.468
The skull was already
compromised prior to impact.

28:52.581 --> 28:55.348
Oh, hold there, Aubrey!

28:55.383 --> 28:57.417
Yeah, we got blood.

28:57.452 --> 29:00.653
Which means this is definitely
how the body was moved.

29:00.689 --> 29:02.088
Okay, good work.

29:02.123 --> 29:03.423
But our victim's blood

29:03.458 --> 29:06.092
won't get us any
closer to our killer.

29:08.029 --> 29:09.863
Uh, hold on a second.

29:09.898 --> 29:12.532
I still see something
down there, so...

29:12.567 --> 29:15.134
Aubrey, I need you to lower me
down about another meter.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.904
Okay. But after this,
you're going on a diet, okay?

29:17.939 --> 29:19.305
Time to easy up
on the carbs.

29:19.341 --> 29:21.941
Seriously? You're giving me
advice on diets?

29:21.977 --> 29:23.209
You just need to hit the gym.

29:23.245 --> 29:25.044
Okay, that's good.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.579
Ah...

29:26.615 --> 29:27.814
Okay.

29:33.355 --> 29:36.422
Oh. Bingo.

29:36.458 --> 29:39.459
Looks like it's
a piece of bedsheet.

29:39.494 --> 29:41.194
It's got blood on it.

29:41.229 --> 29:44.697
Also some kind of hair
and body fluid.

29:44.733 --> 29:48.902
The hair is long, and it's dark.

29:48.937 --> 29:50.470
Actually, it looks jet black.

29:50.505 --> 29:52.372
Probably from a woman.

29:52.407 --> 29:54.073
That could be
Agent Patel's.

29:54.109 --> 29:55.642
Okay, good work.

29:55.677 --> 29:57.110
Just bag it and
that's enough.

29:57.145 --> 29:59.078
Let's get you back up.
No, no, no, no.

29:59.114 --> 30:00.547
Aubrey, I need you
to keep lowering me.

30:00.582 --> 30:02.382
I've still got
about six floors to go.

30:03.818 --> 30:05.418
What do you think?
It's your call.

30:06.288 --> 30:08.821
Whoa! Aubrey!

30:08.857 --> 30:10.390
Catch him!

30:11.426 --> 30:12.659
Whoa!

30:16.231 --> 30:17.697
Now pull him up!
Pull him up!

30:17.732 --> 30:19.566
I can't!
There's no weight!

30:19.601 --> 30:22.569
Hodgins! Hodgins!

30:23.538 --> 30:25.138
Hey.

30:25.173 --> 30:28.041
How you doing up there?

30:28.076 --> 30:29.776
Oh, my God.
He's okay.

30:29.811 --> 30:31.010
Okay, hold on!

30:31.046 --> 30:32.445
We're coming
down to get you.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.047
Take your time, you know.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.582
I'm just hanging out.

30:49.831 --> 30:52.565
Agent Patel...

30:52.601 --> 30:54.567
I just got word
that we found a hair

30:54.603 --> 30:56.703
in Graham Roberts' sheets.

30:56.738 --> 30:59.172
Piece of hair
is being tested right now,

30:59.207 --> 31:01.507
so you have one chance
to come clean.

31:01.543 --> 31:03.643
Were you with him
the night that he died?

31:03.678 --> 31:06.312
All right.
Yes, I was with him.

31:06.348 --> 31:07.513
And you don't think
that's something

31:07.549 --> 31:08.715
you probably
should have told us?

31:08.750 --> 31:10.183
It wasn't serious.
Just an occasional fling.

31:10.218 --> 31:11.684
And we're not allowed
to date in the service.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.753
That's quite a secret
you've been keeping.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.922
I was protecting my job.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.390
And hiding the fact
that you were

31:17.425 --> 31:19.392
probably the last person
who ever saw him alive.

31:19.427 --> 31:20.660
I didn't think
it really mattered.

31:20.695 --> 31:22.295
Yes, we met in his room.

31:22.330 --> 31:23.563
We had sex.

31:23.598 --> 31:24.931
Then I left.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.633
I don't know
who killed him or why.

31:26.668 --> 31:28.201
And I'm guessing that no one
can confirm your story.

31:28.236 --> 31:30.269
How dare you.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.604
I didn't kill him.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.006
You had means,
you had opportunity.

31:33.041 --> 31:34.641
Plus, you lied to me.

31:34.676 --> 31:36.109
I got to hold you.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.211
No, I need to be there
when the president arrives.

31:38.246 --> 31:39.779
You're off the detail.

31:41.583 --> 31:43.182
Agent Coe, you're next.
Conference room, come on.

31:43.218 --> 31:44.450
Hey, Booth, I need my team.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.019
Uh, POTUS moved up
his arrival time.

31:46.054 --> 31:47.120
Where's Patel?

31:47.155 --> 31:48.621
Look, she's
not going, okay?

31:48.657 --> 31:49.922
I have to hold her.
She lied to me.

31:49.958 --> 31:51.591
She was having a
relationship with Roberts.

31:51.626 --> 31:53.393
Damn it, Booth, I can't
have the president arrive

31:53.428 --> 31:54.927
and my best agent here--
you know that!

31:54.963 --> 31:57.196
Fine, all right, you know what?
She stays, I go.

31:57.232 --> 31:59.098
What are you talking about?

31:59.134 --> 32:00.967
While the Secret Service is
watching out for the president,

32:01.002 --> 32:03.236
I'm gonna be watching
the Secret Service; you get it?

32:03.271 --> 32:05.872
I'm joining
your protective detail.

32:10.214 --> 32:12.321
Booth, please.
I know your mind is set,

32:12.421 --> 32:13.987
but I need you
to be careful.

32:14.023 --> 32:16.023
Protective detail is an
extremely dangerous assignment.

32:16.058 --> 32:17.591
Look, I understand, okay?

32:17.626 --> 32:19.192
Walker even convinced
the president, all right,

32:19.228 --> 32:21.061
to move the fund-raiser
to another hotel.

32:21.096 --> 32:23.397
Well, I don't see
how relocating the hotel

32:23.432 --> 32:26.033
is going to make this assignment
any less dangerous.

32:26.068 --> 32:27.801
Well, think about it--
if somebody's been planning

32:27.836 --> 32:29.803
their shot, we move the venue,
then the motorcade route...

32:29.838 --> 32:32.105
Forces him to abandon his plan.

32:32.141 --> 32:34.841
I... It's smart.

32:34.877 --> 32:37.344
But it doesn't
guarantee your safety.

32:37.379 --> 32:39.780
Bones, I really don't have
a choice in the matter, okay?

32:39.815 --> 32:41.148
I got to do this.

32:43.519 --> 32:44.818
I know.

32:44.853 --> 32:46.853
But I need you
to come home safe.

32:46.889 --> 32:49.690
I will, all right?

32:49.725 --> 32:52.125
I will.

32:56.899 --> 32:59.833
Save our jobs!

33:36.038 --> 33:38.839
All right, listen up,
the president wants to stop

33:38.874 --> 33:41.641
and press the flesh,
so get ready.

33:44.012 --> 33:46.313
Okay, he's getting out.
Aubrey, you copy?

33:46.348 --> 33:48.815
Copy. How you doing?

33:48.851 --> 33:50.617
What's your gut telling you?

33:50.652 --> 33:52.185
Ah, nothing good.
At least we're close

33:52.221 --> 33:54.187
to the hotel in case
something happens, right?

34:04.566 --> 34:06.867
It's a big crowd, Booth.
I don't like it.

34:06.902 --> 34:08.534
Just keep your eyes open.

34:08.570 --> 34:10.170
Copy.

34:10.205 --> 34:11.505
Ready for Randall!

34:11.540 --> 34:12.938
Ready for Randall!

34:17.112 --> 34:18.978
Look at the
concomitant fractures.

34:19.014 --> 34:20.847
This damage to the
right temporal bone

34:20.882 --> 34:23.315
was inflicted prior
to the victim's fall.

34:23.351 --> 34:24.618
I concur.

34:24.652 --> 34:26.420
The concentric fractures
from the fall

34:26.455 --> 34:29.456
stop when they encounter the
damage to the temporal squama.

34:29.491 --> 34:30.724
The temporal squama being

34:30.759 --> 34:32.926
a relatively thin
area of the skull.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.529
A fact which further points to
the killer being highly skilled.

34:35.563 --> 34:38.231
He knew the most vulnerable
point at which to strike.

34:38.266 --> 34:41.134
You said Dr. Hodgins found
no trace within the wound?

34:41.170 --> 34:42.803
None, which is strange
if the killer

34:42.838 --> 34:44.404
struck the victim
with any kind of weapon.

34:44.440 --> 34:47.574
But not if he struck him
with his elbow or his knee.

34:47.609 --> 34:49.242
Oh, God.

34:49.277 --> 34:53.280
Yeah, I-I feel the inadequacy
rising up inside of me,

34:53.315 --> 34:54.981
which means that obviously

34:55.016 --> 34:56.882
you've seen this type
of injury before.

34:56.918 --> 34:58.585
Yes, the combatant
was a Navy SEAL,

34:58.620 --> 35:01.054
and he used the maneuver
to kill his would-be captor.

35:01.089 --> 35:03.423
And because the injuries are
on the right side of the face,

35:03.459 --> 35:05.792
that means the killer is
most likely left-hand dominant.

35:05.828 --> 35:07.394
I need to call Booth.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.002
Booth?

35:16.038 --> 35:17.504
Got to be kidding me, Bones.

35:17.539 --> 35:19.239
I'm kind of busy right now.

35:19.274 --> 35:21.508
Whoever killed Agent Roberts
is left-handed

35:21.543 --> 35:23.777
and has military training.

35:23.812 --> 35:25.111
Likely a Navy SEAL.

35:25.147 --> 35:27.514
Wait a second,
Walker was a SEAL.

35:31.019 --> 35:32.953
Okay, thanks. I got to go.

35:32.988 --> 35:35.555
Aubrey, it's Walker, Walker.
We got to move now.

35:35.591 --> 35:37.491
Copy that. I got eyes on Walker.

35:37.526 --> 35:39.125
I'm coming.

35:41.697 --> 35:44.064
Something's wrong here.
Neil Stockton is here.

35:44.099 --> 35:45.599
Neil Stockton is here.

35:45.634 --> 35:46.733
Where? I don't see him.

35:46.768 --> 35:48.101
I don't see him anywhere. Where?

35:52.407 --> 35:53.373
Lost him.

35:53.408 --> 35:54.641
Booth, I lost him.

35:54.676 --> 35:57.444
Hi. Thanks for coming out.

35:59.882 --> 36:01.414
Appreciate it.

36:01.450 --> 36:03.416
I don't see him.
Where? Where is he?

36:03.452 --> 36:05.652
Hi.

36:06.622 --> 36:08.321
Nice to see you.

36:08.357 --> 36:10.690
Thank you.

36:16.798 --> 36:18.331
Nice to see you.

36:20.035 --> 36:21.535
Down! Down, down, down, down!

36:30.012 --> 36:32.112
Move, move, move!
Sir, could you to come with us?!

36:32.147 --> 36:33.747
Go, go, go!
Get him in!

36:34.750 --> 36:36.182
Get him in the limo!

36:41.089 --> 36:43.023
Hey, hey, hey, Walker,
talk to me.

36:43.058 --> 36:44.591
The president?

36:47.095 --> 36:49.095
He's okay. It's over.

37:02.678 --> 37:05.679
The president's
gonna be all right.

37:38.146 --> 37:40.013
Hey.

37:40.048 --> 37:41.982
How you holding up?

37:42.017 --> 37:44.851
Ah, not so good.

37:44.886 --> 37:46.953
Had better days, but...

37:46.989 --> 37:48.888
What brings you here?

37:48.924 --> 37:51.124
The White House
asked me to perform

37:51.159 --> 37:53.259
the autopsy on
Brandt Walker.

37:53.295 --> 37:55.629
And I thought you'd
want to see this.

37:57.032 --> 37:59.532
I found bruising
to his left elbow,

37:59.568 --> 38:01.668
suggesting he struck it
hard recently

38:01.703 --> 38:03.336
against something or someone.

38:03.372 --> 38:05.071
You're saying that he did it?

38:05.107 --> 38:08.141
That he killed his own agent?

38:11.413 --> 38:13.113
When you were
with Agent Walker,

38:13.148 --> 38:15.415
did you witness him
mixing his words?

38:15.450 --> 38:17.317
Any memory loss, paranoia?

38:17.352 --> 38:18.718
Yeah, you know,
he would forget things.

38:18.754 --> 38:20.620
He was sometimes
overly cautious.

38:20.656 --> 38:22.455
But, I mean, that was his job.

38:22.491 --> 38:24.124
See, I think it was a symptom.

38:24.159 --> 38:27.494
He had a heart condition
called patent foramen ovale.

38:27.529 --> 38:29.596
Now, by itself,
it's asymptomatic.

38:29.631 --> 38:32.098
But since he was shot in the
leg, it formed a blood clot.

38:32.134 --> 38:35.201
And instead of exiting
through the heart and lungs,

38:35.237 --> 38:36.970
it migrated to his brain.

38:37.005 --> 38:38.772
So you're saying
that the-the blood clot

38:38.807 --> 38:42.242
caused him to f-forget things
and made him paranoid.

38:42.277 --> 38:44.577
Yeah, and if you already
noticed this behavior...

38:44.613 --> 38:47.213
Agent Roberts
would've seen it as well.

38:47.249 --> 38:48.581
My guess

38:48.617 --> 38:50.684
is that Roberts
demanded that Walker quit.

38:50.719 --> 38:53.086
Walker's life was his job.

38:53.121 --> 38:54.721
And because of the damage
the blood clot caused,

38:54.756 --> 38:56.523
I'm sure it made
perfect sense to him.

38:56.558 --> 38:58.725
He had to kill Roberts
so that he could be there

38:58.760 --> 39:00.560
when the president
needed him the most.

39:05.233 --> 39:07.801
<i>That is insane.</i>

39:07.836 --> 39:09.602
You went in that chute
without telling me?

39:09.638 --> 39:10.603
Sorry.

39:10.639 --> 39:13.673
I also plummeted
an entire story

39:13.709 --> 39:15.842
before grabbing hold.

39:15.877 --> 39:17.610
Oh, Hodgins,

39:17.646 --> 39:19.179
how I envy you.

39:19.214 --> 39:22.048
You stared death
right in the face.

39:22.084 --> 39:24.217
Was she as comely as I imagine?

39:24.252 --> 39:25.552
She was.

39:25.587 --> 39:27.921
I have to say though,
I'm actually grateful

39:27.956 --> 39:29.589
that I'm in this chair.

39:29.624 --> 39:31.157
You're grateful?

39:31.193 --> 39:32.425
Angie, think about this.

39:32.461 --> 39:33.860
You know me, okay?

39:33.895 --> 39:35.895
No matter what,
I was gonna go into that chute,

39:35.931 --> 39:37.530
legs or not.

39:37.566 --> 39:40.233
But if I wasn't
as strong as I am now,

39:40.268 --> 39:43.069
after having months and months
of physical therapy...

39:43.105 --> 39:47.073
The old you wouldn't have been
strong enough to hold on.

39:51.113 --> 39:53.046
Oh.

39:53.081 --> 39:55.115
Sorry.

39:55.150 --> 39:58.985
Ruining the moment and all,
but it appears duty calls.

39:59.020 --> 40:00.687
Uh, hey, Fisher, before you go,

40:00.722 --> 40:03.323
are you finally going to tell us
who it is that you work for?

40:03.358 --> 40:05.191
Now, you know I can't do that.

40:05.227 --> 40:07.127
Oh, there's no need.
I've already figured it out.

40:07.162 --> 40:09.596
Uh, come again?

40:09.631 --> 40:10.897
It wasn't that hard.

40:10.932 --> 40:12.665
You were recommended
by the Secret Service,

40:12.701 --> 40:14.567
so you obviously have a
connection to the White House.

40:14.603 --> 40:16.336
You know what, I'd love
to sit and talk about it,

40:16.371 --> 40:17.771
but I actually do
have to go, so...

40:17.806 --> 40:18.772
And you travel

40:18.807 --> 40:21.074
extensively with those young,

40:21.109 --> 40:23.409
nubile women,
so I'm guessing

40:23.445 --> 40:24.944
that you're probably
a college tutor

40:24.980 --> 40:26.713
for the president's daughter.

40:26.748 --> 40:28.982
No. Fisher, seriously?

40:34.389 --> 40:38.525
Look, before I showed up,
she was a "C" student, okay?

40:38.560 --> 40:41.327
Now, now, now she is
Bs and B-pluses.

40:41.363 --> 40:42.862
She's got one "C,"

40:42.898 --> 40:44.597
and we're working on that
before the finals.

40:44.633 --> 40:47.333
I'm gonna knock
that one up as well, okay?

40:47.369 --> 40:49.836
I hate both of you,
and-and I'm super depressed

40:49.871 --> 40:51.004
that you figured that out.

40:51.039 --> 40:53.072
I'm off my game these days.

40:53.108 --> 40:55.708
Bye.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.216
Here you go.

41:03.251 --> 41:04.884
Booth, I'm so sorry.
I feel terrible.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.386
Right, well, you really

41:06.421 --> 41:08.421
took a turn for the
worse, didn't you?

41:08.456 --> 41:09.789
No, not that.
That's not what I mean.

41:09.825 --> 41:11.958
What I mean is that
I feel terrible that,

41:11.993 --> 41:13.359
after the day you've had,

41:13.395 --> 41:14.961
the situation
should be reversed.

41:14.996 --> 41:16.996
I should be
taking care of you.

41:18.066 --> 41:19.499
No, I'm okay. I'm fine.

41:19.534 --> 41:20.967
Actually, it's better
that I'm here,

41:21.002 --> 41:22.335
you know, taking care of you.

41:22.370 --> 41:24.437
It helps me, you know...

41:24.472 --> 41:25.872
get my mind off of things.

41:25.907 --> 41:27.640
I understand.

41:27.676 --> 41:29.976
But I know how much
it weighs on you

41:30.011 --> 41:32.078
to take another life.

41:32.113 --> 41:35.348
Whenever you want to talk
about it, I'm here.

41:35.383 --> 41:36.683
Always.

41:36.718 --> 41:39.152
Thanks.

41:39.187 --> 41:41.120
But, uh, right now,

41:41.156 --> 41:44.157
I'm here to take care of you,
so you get better.

41:44.192 --> 41:47.927
So, how about I go get you
a cup of that anus tea?

41:47.963 --> 41:51.164
Booth, I've told you before,
it's "anise."

41:51.199 --> 41:53.166
Anus, ani--
Come on, I'm joking, okay?

41:53.201 --> 41:55.768
Everyone knows that
laughter's the best medicine.

41:55.804 --> 41:57.270
No, penicillin is
the best medicine.

41:57.305 --> 42:00.139
It's saved countless millions
from infections.

42:00.175 --> 42:01.608
Okay, now what?
You're being funny?

42:01.643 --> 42:02.876
No, I'm being serious.

42:02.911 --> 42:04.444
You'd rather take penicillin
over laughter?

42:04.479 --> 42:07.914
That's like saying that you'd
take mold over the Stooges.

42:07.949 --> 42:09.182
Penicillin is not a mold.

42:09.217 --> 42:11.150
It's derived from fungi.

42:11.186 --> 42:12.919
Well, okay, well,
the Stooges are fun guys.

42:14.556 --> 42:16.256
That's not the same thing.

42:18.660 --> 42:20.260
Got you laughing.

42:20.295 --> 42:22.996
You're gonna make me cough!

42:24.599 --> 42:25.732
Hey, Moe!
Hey, Moe!

42:25.767 --> 42:27.400
Stop it.
Hey, Moe! Hey, Moe!

42:27.435 --> 42:30.403
<i>I'm gonna cough on you.</i>
<i>Hey, Moe! Hey, Moe!</i>
