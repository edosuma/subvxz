What are you... You can't
dance like that to Biggie.

00:23.429 --> 00:25.729
Hey, I like that song. Is it new?

00:27.099 --> 00:29.434
What... How the hell do
you not know that song?

00:29.435 --> 00:30.702
It's so important.

00:30.703 --> 00:32.703
People get married to that
song where I'm from.

00:34.473 --> 00:38.310
This place has really come to
life since it's been Maxine'd.

00:38.311 --> 00:40.378
You added pillows.

00:40.379 --> 00:42.713
You came in, you added
tampons and pillows.

00:43.915 --> 00:45.684
Really? Live with a
woman for five minutes,

00:45.685 --> 00:47.252
already gonna make a tampon joke?

00:47.253 --> 00:49.621
Yeah, well, someone's got to be
brave enough to do it, Maxine.

00:49.622 --> 00:51.957
Hey, it's our first mail together.

00:51.958 --> 00:53.225
Yeah, yeah.

00:53.226 --> 00:55.927
And it says "Resident."

00:55.928 --> 00:58.395
Well, that's us. We're Resident.

00:59.564 --> 01:02.467
So how have you told your parents yet?

01:02.468 --> 01:05.670
Ooh. About what?

01:05.671 --> 01:08.373
About us living together?

01:08.374 --> 01:10.776
Oh, that. No, no, not at all.

01:10.777 --> 01:12.744
What... Come on, you
said you were going to.

01:12.745 --> 01:13.979
It's been, like, four weeks.

01:13.980 --> 01:16.448
I know, and then I thought
about it and I was like,

01:16.449 --> 01:19.818
"Hey, let's just never do that."

01:19.819 --> 01:21.820
What's this "last chance
to register" thing?

01:21.821 --> 01:24.089
Oh, this? They trying to get me to vote.

01:24.090 --> 01:27.125
Let me take care of this for you.

01:27.126 --> 01:28.794
What? You don't vote?

01:28.795 --> 01:31.329
I... Look, in 2008, right,

01:31.330 --> 01:34.032
I saw this man rise from being
poor and black in America

01:34.033 --> 01:35.767
to the greatest office
in the United States.

01:35.768 --> 01:38.570
Actually... the greatest
office in the world.

01:38.571 --> 01:40.872
And I felt pride, you
know? I felt inspired.

01:40.873 --> 01:44.042
He inspired me and so many other people.

01:44.043 --> 01:45.911
I mean, so many other people, I figured,

01:45.912 --> 01:47.746
hell, he doesn't need me.
Like, I think he...

01:47.747 --> 01:49.181
he won the Nobel Peace Prize,

01:49.182 --> 01:51.048
and I don't even know what he did.

01:52.884 --> 01:54.319
All right, you know
what, enough politics.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.054
Don't try and shy away from the topic.

01:56.055 --> 01:57.789
We see your parents all the time.

01:57.790 --> 01:59.558
I mean, we're going to their
house for dinner later.

01:59.559 --> 02:01.426
- They should know.
- You know what,

02:01.427 --> 02:03.295
you're right, Maxine. We
shouldn't talk about politics.

02:03.296 --> 02:05.030
And why bother, anyway?
'Cause your vote doesn't count

02:05.031 --> 02:06.998
and democracy is dead.

02:06.999 --> 02:08.900
Now, why would you say that...

02:08.901 --> 02:11.203
No. No, no, no, no.
Stop trying to deflect

02:11.204 --> 02:12.671
from the real subject.

02:12.672 --> 02:14.806
- Women's rights.
- No.

02:14.807 --> 02:17.475
Why can't we tell them?
Your parents are harmless.

02:17.476 --> 02:19.044
Yeah, they're harmless now,
because they don't know

02:19.045 --> 02:20.812
how serious we are, all right?
But once they find out

02:20.813 --> 02:23.048
we moved in together, it's
gonna change everything.

02:23.049 --> 02:25.383
Like, my mom's gonna give a
million reasons from the Bible

02:25.384 --> 02:28.553
why that's wrong. Then
my dad's gonna start...

02:28.554 --> 02:30.722
I really don't know what he's
gonna do. He's a wild card.

02:30.723 --> 02:33.658
But he's probably gonna do
something crazy and give advice.

02:33.659 --> 02:35.961
But right now it's cool,
it's peaceful, you know?

02:35.962 --> 02:38.929
Because you mean nothing
to them. I mean, nothing.

02:40.065 --> 02:41.499
But, like, in a good way, you know?

02:41.500 --> 02:43.535
(phone vibrates)

02:43.536 --> 02:45.170
Wait a minute.

02:45.171 --> 02:46.638
My brother's here.

02:46.639 --> 02:48.139
Text him back and tell
him you're not home.

02:48.140 --> 02:49.941
I can't lie to my brother.
I can't even tell a lie.

02:49.942 --> 02:51.209
I'm like George Washington.

02:51.210 --> 02:53.745
Bet you wouldn't have
voted for him, either.

02:53.746 --> 02:55.647
That's more because of the, you know...

02:55.648 --> 02:58.383
slavery.

02:58.384 --> 03:01.486
How long after you've
been divorced is your

03:01.487 --> 03:03.855
ex-wife/roommate allowed
to sleep with somebody else?

03:03.856 --> 03:06.124
Immediately. You're divorced.

03:06.125 --> 03:08.660
Look, man, I came home, and
there was a butt-naked dude

03:08.661 --> 03:10.929
sitting on my couch
watching my TV, and there...

03:10.930 --> 03:12.898
and there was sex musk still in the air.

03:12.899 --> 03:14.933
Like, a bunch of sex musk.

03:14.934 --> 03:17.936
I'm sor... I'm sorry, wha...

03:17.937 --> 03:18.904
What's that? What was...

03:18.905 --> 03:22.240
Sex-sex musk.

03:22.241 --> 03:23.742
I have no idea what he's saying.

03:23.743 --> 03:25.210
Sex musk, okay?

03:25.211 --> 03:27.479
It's the musk in the air
after you have sex.

03:27.480 --> 03:28.780
Oh, sex musk.

03:28.781 --> 03:31.650
Oh, sex musk. Oh, okay.
That is hard to say.

03:31.651 --> 03:33.051
That's pretty interesting. Sex musk.

03:33.052 --> 03:34.886
Look, Bobby, technically
she's your ex-wife,

03:34.887 --> 03:36.655
so she's free to do whatever she wants.

03:36.656 --> 03:38.323
You know something?
Look, you are so neg...

03:38.324 --> 03:40.191
Not for long, okay?
It's all gonna be over.

03:40.192 --> 03:41.993
I'm gonna be out of there
soon, because my business

03:41.994 --> 03:44.596
- is about to take off, Jerrod.
- Nope, nope, nope.

03:44.597 --> 03:46.197
Stop calling it your business

03:46.198 --> 03:47.632
when you know it's a pyramid scheme.

03:47.633 --> 03:49.534
I know, I get it... you
went to business school.

03:49.535 --> 03:51.002
But I'm from the school of hard knocks.

03:51.003 --> 03:53.037
Mm. Not a real school, bro.

03:54.172 --> 03:56.041
Say what? Look... '03, valedictorian.

03:56.042 --> 03:59.010
Stop it. Stop it.

03:59.011 --> 04:00.679
Bob.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.482
The next time there is
a sock on the door...

04:02.483 --> 04:03.315
That was unclear.

04:03.316 --> 04:06.384
...and a sign that says "sexual
intercourse in progress,"

04:06.385 --> 04:08.086
do not enter.

04:08.087 --> 04:09.955
Do you know how uncomfortable
you made Lamont?

04:09.956 --> 04:11.456
You wouldn't watch the game with him.

04:11.457 --> 04:13.091
He's trying to make friends with you.

04:13.092 --> 04:15.827
You hurt his feelings.
You need to go apologize to him.

04:15.828 --> 04:17.462
I don't give a damn about no Lamont!

04:17.463 --> 04:19.564
Hey, hey, hey.

04:19.565 --> 04:21.565
You guys maybe want to finish
this in your own apartment?

04:21.567 --> 04:25.236
Oh, I'm gonna have a argument
wherever I damn... Hey, girl!

04:25.237 --> 04:27.639
- I was just about to cuss your man out.
- (Maxine chuckles)

04:27.640 --> 04:28.974
Please do.

04:28.975 --> 04:30.342
Oh... Are you all having a fight?

04:30.343 --> 04:31.943
- No.
- Yup. Y...

04:31.944 --> 04:33.745
She's mad at me 'cause
I'm not registered to vote.

04:33.746 --> 04:35.947
Mm, I wish we had them problems.

04:35.948 --> 04:37.615
MAXINE: No. N-no... (chuckles)

04:37.616 --> 04:39.584
That's not it. I just
want to tell your parents

04:39.585 --> 04:40.952
that we've moved in together.

04:40.953 --> 04:42.287
No!

04:42.288 --> 04:44.556
You crazy?

04:44.557 --> 04:46.024
Dude, you cannot let Mom and Dad

04:46.025 --> 04:47.292
in your personal life like that.

04:47.293 --> 04:49.294
Man, they are too judgmental.
You know, they scare me.

04:49.295 --> 04:50.695
They hurt my feelings.
That's why I haven't

04:50.696 --> 04:52.097
even told 'em me and
Nekeisha are divorced.

04:52.098 --> 04:53.131
See, Maxine?

04:53.132 --> 04:54.432
What? How long

04:54.433 --> 04:55.900
are you gonna keep that a secret?

04:55.901 --> 04:57.502
(short chuckle) Forever.

04:57.503 --> 04:58.869
Mm-hmm.

05:02.273 --> 05:04.509
So I've been thinking about
this problem you have

05:04.510 --> 05:06.544
with telling your parents
we live together.

05:06.545 --> 05:08.156
And I think I came up with
the perfect solution.

05:08.157 --> 05:09.114
You did?

05:09.115 --> 05:10.547
I'm just gonna tell them tonight.

05:12.183 --> 05:13.985
- You will not tell them tonight.
- Oh.

05:13.986 --> 05:15.720
You don't control me.
I'm not your girl puppet.

05:15.721 --> 05:16.921
These strings are cut.

05:16.922 --> 05:18.823
I'm like a puppet out of a horror movie.

05:18.824 --> 05:20.959
No, no, no, Maxine, you
will not even <i>mention...</i>

05:20.960 --> 05:23.661
- Hey! Mommy.
- Oh!

05:23.662 --> 05:25.964

Ribs with a nacho cheese dipping sauce.

06:39.980 --> 06:41.314
No, now, wait, wait, wait.

06:41.315 --> 06:43.483
What happened was
I was eating some ribs.

06:43.484 --> 06:45.418
And I had this nacho
cheese dipping sauce,

06:45.419 --> 06:47.553
and then I thought, "Well, hell."

06:49.055 --> 06:52.759
He did. He did that.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.694
Why are you proud of this?
And why are you

06:54.695 --> 06:57.197
out of breath? And all you did
was walk from the kitchen.

06:57.198 --> 06:59.399
Listen boy, I work a ten-hour shift

06:59.400 --> 07:00.733
driving trucks every day.

07:00.734 --> 07:02.869
When I come home,
I want to eat something

07:02.870 --> 07:05.538
that helps me forget how hard life is.

07:05.539 --> 07:07.140
You're not gonna stop
me from enjoying this.

07:07.141 --> 07:09.409
If I have to raise these hands

07:09.410 --> 07:11.277
to defend these ribs, I will.

07:11.278 --> 07:14.180
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance

07:14.181 --> 07:16.361
- and furiou...
- Hey, we brought you guys something.

07:17.350 --> 07:19.586
Oh! What is this?

07:19.587 --> 07:20.854
It's Pinot Grigio.

07:20.855 --> 07:23.823
Pinot... Wha...

07:23.824 --> 07:25.258
- It's white.
- Oh.

07:25.259 --> 07:26.726
You like white, right?

07:26.727 --> 07:29.261
Not as much as your daddy.

07:35.135 --> 07:36.803
Is it sweet?

07:36.804 --> 07:38.271
Uh, not really.

07:38.272 --> 07:40.205
Oh. Okay.

07:42.442 --> 07:45.345
Okay, well, Jerrod and I have
something to tell you, don't we?

07:45.346 --> 07:46.679
Th... Yes.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.781
Yes, we do. We have something
very, very important

07:48.782 --> 07:49.795
we should say.

07:49.796 --> 07:51.818
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.653
I figured it's time to tell
you guys. And I didn't

07:53.654 --> 07:55.688
want to say anything,
'cause I thought you'd be

07:55.689 --> 07:58.691
mad or something, but I am...

07:58.692 --> 08:00.026
thinking about registering Republican.

08:00.027 --> 08:02.160
Oh, no.

08:03.730 --> 08:07.467
Jerrod, you know we didn't
raise you that way.

08:07.468 --> 08:10.270
I know, but I was thinking about it.
Like, do we really know

08:10.271 --> 08:12.405
- why we voted for Obama?
- No, that is not what...

08:12.406 --> 08:14.407
No, I'm not saying he's
doing a bad job or anything.

08:14.408 --> 08:16.142
I'm just saying none of
you could tell me why

08:16.143 --> 08:18.244
you voted for him without using
the words "hope" or "change."

08:18.245 --> 08:21.214
Michelle.

08:21.215 --> 08:22.014
Or Michelle.

08:22.015 --> 08:24.317
Okay, this isn't what
we're here to discuss.

08:24.318 --> 08:25.919
Obama is a good president.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.820
He is a good man.

08:27.821 --> 08:30.555
All right, well, you just said
nothing at all right there, Mom.

08:31.791 --> 08:32.892
You know, come to think of it,

08:32.893 --> 08:33.927
maybe this boy does have a point.

08:33.928 --> 08:35.562
No, he doesn't have a point.

08:35.563 --> 08:36.962
He's just trying to distract us.

08:36.964 --> 08:38.831
Well, I did vote for Bush in 2004.

08:38.832 --> 08:41.501
- What?
- What? - What?

08:41.501 --> 08:43.001
Lead with that, man.

08:43.003 --> 08:44.437
Don't leave me all alone out here.

08:44.438 --> 08:45.638
Well, I didn't really think it had much

08:45.639 --> 08:46.973
to do with the conversation.

08:46.974 --> 08:48.841
Joe, you have on

08:48.842 --> 08:51.543
an Obama T-shirt right now.

08:52.378 --> 08:54.513
This is not Obama, this is Neobama.

08:56.783 --> 08:58.718
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
why would you vote for Bush?

08:58.719 --> 09:01.254
I mean, he favors the rich,
and you're not in that...

09:01.255 --> 09:02.888
bracket.

09:03.756 --> 09:05.992
You calling me poor?

09:05.993 --> 09:08.461
Yes.

09:08.462 --> 09:10.430
That's why I did it.

09:10.431 --> 09:12.198
He sent me that stimulator check.

09:12.199 --> 09:15.834
No president ever sent me $1,600.

09:16.836 --> 09:19.606
Nobody ever sent me $1,600.

09:19.607 --> 09:21.274
You can bomb whoever you want

09:21.275 --> 09:24.143
long as you send me $1,600.

09:24.144 --> 09:26.746
JERROD: You see?

09:26.747 --> 09:28.581
Dad's right. I mean, we
could have done without

09:28.582 --> 09:31.084
- the whole bombing part, but...
- I stand by the whole bombing part.

09:31.085 --> 09:33.052
And-and I'm sure you do, but I'm
just saying we don't need it...

09:33.053 --> 09:35.121
Guantanamo Bay. It's a good thing.

09:35.122 --> 09:36.756
Okay, Dad, please don't
say stuff like that.

09:36.757 --> 09:39.659
Well, sometimes you just got to
put water in somebody's face

09:39.660 --> 09:40.992
to get answers.

09:42.362 --> 09:45.798
Joe, are you saying that your
vote could be bought?

09:45.799 --> 09:48.668
No. But it can be stimulated.

09:48.669 --> 09:50.837
I am taking away your ribs.

09:50.838 --> 09:53.640
- I'm not gonna let 'em go.
- You have lost your ribliges.

09:53.641 --> 09:56.075
I will not... I-I will
not... I will not...

09:56.076 --> 09:57.977
- Joe!
- Give me these ribs!

09:57.978 --> 10:01.447
That stimulator check paid
for part of those ribs.

10:01.448 --> 10:02.715
You know what, it doesn't matter.

10:02.716 --> 10:05.184
Now that we're done
distracting everyone, Jerrod,

10:05.185 --> 10:06.452
what we really want to talk about...

10:06.453 --> 10:08.021
Is prayer in school.
Let's talk about it.

10:08.022 --> 10:09.789
- Huh?
- There is prayer

10:09.790 --> 10:11.958
- in school.
- No, there's not, Mom.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.593
And it's because of the Democrats.

10:13.594 --> 10:17.130
You mean they won't let
the little babies pray?

10:17.131 --> 10:18.931
And think about it, Mom...
what kind of prayer

10:18.932 --> 10:20.400
would they say if they could?

10:20.401 --> 10:22.235
Well, just normal, regular prayer.

10:22.236 --> 10:24.904
You know, thanking Jesus
for all he done for you.

10:24.905 --> 10:26.939
Yeah, but then what about
the Jews or the Muslims

10:26.940 --> 10:29.409
- or the atheists?
- Okay, Jerrod and I want to tell you...

10:29.410 --> 10:31.444
Well, then I would put
them in a separate place,

10:31.445 --> 10:33.746
like the cafeteria.

10:33.747 --> 10:36.749
Jerrod and I have life news.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.651
So you would segregate them?

10:38.652 --> 10:40.520
Oh, no, of course not.

10:40.521 --> 10:42.689
But just for their comfort,
I would remove them

10:42.690 --> 10:44.757
from the prayer room, I would

10:44.758 --> 10:46.292
put them in a separate room

10:46.293 --> 10:48.094
that was equally as nice, becau...

10:48.095 --> 10:50.296
Oh!

10:50.297 --> 10:52.865
I know what you're doing,
and I don't approve.

10:52.866 --> 10:55.134
So what you're telling me is

10:55.135 --> 10:57.837
you would pick religion
over civil liberties.

10:57.838 --> 10:59.138
Good question, Dad!

10:59.139 --> 11:00.973
That is not what I'm saying!

11:00.974 --> 11:03.309
Joe, stop putting words in my mouth!

11:03.310 --> 11:04.610
Well, I mean, if you had to pick,

11:04.611 --> 11:05.878
which one would you choose,

11:05.879 --> 11:07.947
serving Jesus or freedom?

11:07.948 --> 11:09.916
Serving Jesus, because
if it wasn't for Jesus,

11:09.917 --> 11:11.150
you wouldn't be free!

11:11.151 --> 11:13.286
Damn good answer, Mom.

11:13.287 --> 11:14.821
That's not a good answer.

11:14.822 --> 11:17.090
Without freedom, you
wouldn't have religion.

11:17.091 --> 11:19.092
Listen, don't you be upset with me

11:19.093 --> 11:21.094
because I'm sticking up for my beliefs

11:21.095 --> 11:25.665
instead of being bought by
a $1,600 stimulus check!

11:25.666 --> 11:28.935
Well, look at you, all holier than thou,

11:28.936 --> 11:31.804
acting like we didn't have sex
before we got married.

11:31.805 --> 11:33.472
(Cynthia yelps)

11:36.142 --> 11:40.045
Joe, that wasn't me!

11:48.254 --> 11:51.389
Oh, yeah. Damn.

11:58.865 --> 12:01.734
So, uh, Maxine,

12:01.735 --> 12:04.436
you had something you
wanted to say, right?

12:17.436 --> 12:19.236
(grunts)

12:24.368 --> 12:26.837
So, to avoid telling them,

12:26.838 --> 12:28.906
you picked a fight between your parents?

12:28.907 --> 12:31.842
I know. It's crazy how
well that worked, right?

12:31.843 --> 12:34.244
Are you trying to do that right now?

12:34.245 --> 12:36.380
Yeah. It's makeup sex.
We got to have makeup sex.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.582
Oh, no, we're still fighting.

12:40.450 --> 12:42.920
Don't push me in my Snuggie.

12:42.921 --> 12:45.173
Why are you being so
aggressive right now?

12:45.174 --> 12:47.041
Because you pissed me off.

12:47.042 --> 12:49.143
Wait, wait, are you
really mad about this?

12:49.144 --> 12:51.078
Jerrod, I want to have

12:51.079 --> 12:52.880
a real relationship with
you and your parents,

12:52.881 --> 12:54.314
but if you can't even tell them

12:54.315 --> 12:55.816
that we live together, then maybe

12:55.817 --> 12:57.518
we shouldn't even be dating.

12:57.519 --> 12:59.085
(sighs): God.

13:01.255 --> 13:04.858
Damn it, I have nowhere
to go! We live together!

13:04.859 --> 13:06.593
Maxine, I knew you wanted to tell them.

13:06.594 --> 13:08.630
I just didn't know you were
this serious about it.

13:08.631 --> 13:11.166
Why can't we tell them? No, honestly.

13:11.167 --> 13:13.334
Like, no jokes, no song and dance,

13:13.335 --> 13:15.837
no man-child bull crap.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.707
Just tell me. Why?

13:18.708 --> 13:20.475
Honestly, because I don't want my mom

13:20.476 --> 13:21.976
getting in your head, you know?

13:21.977 --> 13:23.978
Like, once she's in there,
she's not gonna get out.

13:23.979 --> 13:26.414
I'm a therapist.

13:26.415 --> 13:28.216
In training.

13:28.217 --> 13:30.518
And you're still no match for my mom.

13:30.519 --> 13:33.121
And I don't want my dad
handing out useless advice.

13:33.122 --> 13:36.024
I like it how it is right now.
It's just us, you know?

13:36.025 --> 13:38.626
Just me and you and...

13:38.627 --> 13:40.228
a whole bunch of candles.

13:40.229 --> 13:42.697
Why are there so many
candles here, really?

13:42.698 --> 13:45.666
It's like you're having a séance.

13:48.269 --> 13:49.604
Look,

13:49.605 --> 13:51.539
it's unrealistic to believe

13:51.540 --> 13:54.308
that we'll never tell
them we live together.

13:55.143 --> 13:56.778
Fair enough.

13:56.779 --> 13:59.147
And if it's that important to you,

13:59.148 --> 14:01.516
you're that important to
me, and we'll tell them.

14:01.517 --> 14:03.485
All right?

14:03.486 --> 14:05.353
Great. Let's go.

14:05.354 --> 14:07.589
Uh, I'm sorry, now?

14:07.590 --> 14:08.957
- Yeah. Let's go!
- Yeah, but now?

14:08.958 --> 14:11.192
Okay, yeah, let's go. Let's go.

14:11.193 --> 14:12.761
Let's go back to my parents' house,

14:12.762 --> 14:15.362
'cause that worked so
well the first time.

14:17.699 --> 14:19.833
- Oh!
- (gasps)

14:20.668 --> 14:22.237
Hi, Joe.

14:22.238 --> 14:24.339
I thought you were a burglar.

14:24.340 --> 14:27.509
But you still were gonna answer the door?

14:27.510 --> 14:31.012
Yeah, to kick your ass.

14:31.013 --> 14:33.548
Where's Mom?

14:33.549 --> 14:35.682
In the kitchen, where a woman belongs.

14:36.818 --> 14:38.453
I'm just kidding. She's in the kitchen.

14:38.454 --> 14:40.587
It's her choice.

14:43.224 --> 14:45.360
And for my final SlicePro demonstration,

14:45.361 --> 14:47.762
I am going to cut this
penny right in half.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.464
- Oh!
- Uh-uh, we can't afford

14:49.465 --> 14:51.366
- to be cutting up money like that.
- No, watch this.

14:51.367 --> 14:52.103
Here we go.

14:52.104 --> 14:53.368
Now, watch out. You're
gonna cut your finger.

14:53.369 --> 14:54.936
No, I got this. Watch this. Here we go.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.171
No, you're gonna cut
yourself again, Bobby.

14:56.172 --> 14:57.739
- No, I won't. I got it!
- It's too strong.

14:57.740 --> 14:58.940
Did the boy cut himself yet?

14:58.941 --> 15:00.108
No, I got... (shouting)

15:00.109 --> 15:01.943
Aah! Y'all done got in my head!

15:01.944 --> 15:03.945
You done ruined the whole demonstration.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.246
Okay, never mind that. I got something

15:05.247 --> 15:06.614
I got to tell you, Mom and Dad.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.449
Are you about to come out of the closet?

15:08.450 --> 15:09.851
Is that what's happening here?

15:09.852 --> 15:11.619
No. No, Dad.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.321
- You know Marvin?
- Yeah.

15:13.322 --> 15:14.789
He gay.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.524
(laughing)

15:16.525 --> 15:17.826
Like Marvin Gaye.

15:17.827 --> 15:19.427
I get the joke. I get the joke, Dad.

15:19.428 --> 15:20.695
It's a good dad joke.

15:20.696 --> 15:22.230
I know, I know.

15:22.231 --> 15:23.731
You got to write that down, man!

15:23.732 --> 15:25.767
Okay, enough... You guys,

15:25.768 --> 15:27.635
I have something really
important I got to say.

15:27.636 --> 15:31.272
- Oh, Lord, here goes. Let me get my Bible.
- Ma...

15:31.273 --> 15:33.808
(humming)

15:33.809 --> 15:36.522
- Ma...
- Dear Heavenly Father...

15:36.523 --> 15:37.202
Ma...

15:37.203 --> 15:38.880
There's something Jerrod
and I need to tell you.

15:38.881 --> 15:40.849
All right, but you know it is bad luck

15:40.850 --> 15:42.483
to interrupt mid-prayer.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.485
Is that in the Bible or are you
just winging it right now?

15:44.486 --> 15:45.653
Look, Ma,

15:45.654 --> 15:46.888
Maxine and I

15:46.889 --> 15:48.423
are thinking about moving in together.

15:48.424 --> 15:49.823
Oh?

15:50.992 --> 15:54.229
And by "thinking about,"

15:54.230 --> 15:57.332
I mean Maxine moved in three weeks ago.

15:57.333 --> 15:58.832
Well, congratulations.

16:01.202 --> 16:03.171
This is exciting.

16:03.172 --> 16:05.473
- It is?
- Yeah, it is.

16:05.474 --> 16:08.142
Of course it is. Unless you're
sleeping in the same bed

16:08.143 --> 16:09.677
or anything like that.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.145
- Ma, don't...
- I mean, the Bible

16:11.146 --> 16:13.381
is pretty clear on that one.

16:13.382 --> 16:15.717
Put a ring on it!

16:15.718 --> 16:17.485
JOE: Honey,

16:17.486 --> 16:20.021
you're prying a little bit.
Let's respect their privacy.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.123
Now, these kids obviously love each other

16:22.124 --> 16:23.458
or y'all wouldn't have moved in.

16:23.459 --> 16:24.392
That's right.

16:24.393 --> 16:25.627
You do love each other, right?

16:25.628 --> 16:27.195
Dad, I'm not having this
conversation with you.

16:27.196 --> 16:29.364
You know how you tell if
you really love somebody?

16:29.365 --> 16:32.600
Next time you're at home alone,
you turn off all the lights

16:32.601 --> 16:35.236
and you put on Al Green's
"Love and Happiness"...

16:35.237 --> 16:36.971
- Okay. All right. Thanks, Dad...
- and-and...

16:36.972 --> 16:39.073
and you picture her face,
and if you don't start crying,

16:39.074 --> 16:40.174
it ain't meant to be.

16:40.175 --> 16:42.043
Okay, Dad, thank you for...

16:42.044 --> 16:43.945
- ♪ Love and happiness ♪
- Oh!

16:43.946 --> 16:47.614
♪ Make you want to, ah... ♪

16:49.083 --> 16:51.953
I feel the tears coming. I'm
thinking about your mama. (squeals)

16:51.954 --> 16:55.123
Come here, baby! Mmm!

16:55.124 --> 16:56.758
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

16:56.759 --> 16:58.593
See, this is why I didn't
want to tell you guys.

16:58.594 --> 17:00.862
- You didn't want to tell us?
- Why not?

17:00.863 --> 17:02.130
'Cause you guys are so overbearing

17:02.131 --> 17:03.564
with your judgment and advice.

17:03.565 --> 17:04.832
We're just trying to help.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.334
Oh, no. Okay, it doesn't need to be...

17:06.335 --> 17:08.603
Oh, my. Y'all been together
for a couple of weeks,

17:08.604 --> 17:10.570
and you think you figured
it all out, huh?

17:10.571 --> 17:12.140
No, no. We...

17:12.141 --> 17:15.376
Uh-huh. Voting Republican
and living in sin.

17:15.377 --> 17:17.477
That's nasty.

17:19.414 --> 17:22.416
Look, Ma, I don't need
your criticism, okay?

17:22.417 --> 17:24.719
And, Dad, I don't need your unsolicited,

17:24.720 --> 17:26.721
barely even relevant advice, okay?

17:26.722 --> 17:28.489
We just want to have
our own relationship

17:28.490 --> 17:30.124
without outside interference.

17:30.125 --> 17:32.593
What is wrong with my advice?
I give great advice.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.796
Like I told you that time at McDonald's,

17:34.797 --> 17:36.998
always order your fries without salt.

17:36.999 --> 17:39.766
That way, they got
to make a fresh batch.

17:40.868 --> 17:42.769
Damn, that's good advice, Daddy!

17:44.739 --> 17:48.242
Well, I think moving in is a great step.

17:48.243 --> 17:50.611
It's just a-a little bit out of order,

17:50.612 --> 17:53.047
- if you were to ask me.
- Ma...

17:53.048 --> 17:55.316
So, you're going to be
living together, huh?

17:55.317 --> 17:58.486
Well, have you at least
talked about tying the knot?

17:58.487 --> 18:00.154
Not really.

18:00.155 --> 18:04.125
Well, Maxine, you ain't getting no younger.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.460
(clears throat) Well,

18:05.461 --> 18:07.562
with all due respect, Mrs. Carmichael,

18:07.563 --> 18:10.264
I don't believe that a
woman's sole purpose in life

18:10.265 --> 18:12.934
is to get married and start a family.

18:12.935 --> 18:16.270
- Uh-oh.
- CYNTHIA: Oh.

18:16.271 --> 18:19.440
Oh. Sweet, sweet Maxine,

18:19.441 --> 18:22.744
thinking that, oh, you got
all the time in the world

18:22.745 --> 18:25.580
to date and see how everything goes.

18:25.581 --> 18:28.349
You know, I bet your life
is just one big episode

18:28.350 --> 18:31.084
of <i>Sex and the City,</i> huh?

18:32.453 --> 18:33.888
Fine.

18:33.889 --> 18:36.691
When do you plan on having children?

18:36.692 --> 18:39.027
Well, I plan to focus on my career first

18:39.028 --> 18:40.995
before I even start thinking
about that. (chuckles)

18:40.996 --> 18:43.498
CYNTHIA: Well, now, Joe, let's see,

18:43.499 --> 18:44.732
she's got a couple of years

18:44.733 --> 18:46.200
before she finishes her schooling...

18:46.201 --> 18:48.736
And to become a psychologist,
you got to go to grad school.

18:48.737 --> 18:50.071
- That's a few more years.
- Uh-huh.

18:50.072 --> 18:52.306
And don't forget about her post-doc.

18:52.307 --> 18:53.708
And you got to set up your practice.

18:53.709 --> 18:55.943
Oh. Well, I hope

18:55.944 --> 18:59.012
your ovaries don't mind
waiting because...

19:00.448 --> 19:02.598
...'cause, honey, we talking
powdered eggs, Joe.

19:02.599 --> 19:03.407
Mm-hmm.

19:05.720 --> 19:08.189
Nothing but dust up in there,

19:08.190 --> 19:10.790
- like-like emptying out a vacuum cleaner.
- Oh!

19:13.261 --> 19:15.096
Honey, we're just saying,

19:15.097 --> 19:17.564
biology is biology.

19:19.801 --> 19:22.403
Have you thought about that, Maxine?

19:22.404 --> 19:25.306
Have you? Have you?

19:25.307 --> 19:27.141
Bobby and Nekeisha got
divorced three months ago!

19:27.142 --> 19:29.510
What?!

19:29.511 --> 19:31.278
CYNTHIA: What?!

19:32.980 --> 19:35.483
Man... boy...

19:35.484 --> 19:38.052
(stammers) Man, why would you do that?
Man, what's wrong with you?

19:38.053 --> 19:40.655
We do not get divorces in this family.

19:40.656 --> 19:42.589
We just suffer through it!

19:43.991 --> 19:46.427
And you two are still living together?

19:46.428 --> 19:48.896
Well, now I can tell y'all
about Lamont, right?

19:48.897 --> 19:50.698
Who the hell is Lamont?!

19:50.699 --> 19:53.901
Oh, Lord Jesus, look
what you made me say.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.570
I think I might know this Lamont.

19:55.571 --> 19:57.205
Does he have a flattop?

19:57.206 --> 19:58.940
NEKEISHA: Yeah, yeah, that's him.

19:58.941 --> 20:00.441
Thank you. (chuckles)

20:00.442 --> 20:01.943
Welcome to the family.

20:01.944 --> 20:05.178
Nasty. Y'all just nasty!

20:17.068 --> 20:19.134
I don't know why they
keep trying to sell us

20:19.135 --> 20:20.535
these electric cars.

20:20.536 --> 20:23.071
'Cause they're so much
better for the environment.

20:23.072 --> 20:25.573
What's wrong with the environment?

20:25.574 --> 20:29.244
The Chinese keep messing it
up... that's what's wrong.

20:29.245 --> 20:31.479
Come on, Dad, you can't say that.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.814
CYNTHIA: You know,

20:32.815 --> 20:34.883
I just don't think these cars is safe.

20:34.884 --> 20:39.020
You know, they look like
they're made out of tinfoil.

20:39.021 --> 20:41.723
Hey, Jerrod.

20:41.724 --> 20:44.059
Hey, Jerrod.

20:44.060 --> 20:46.628
- Jerrod, hey.
- Yes. Yes.

20:46.629 --> 20:49.297
What do you call a Chinese rapper?

20:49.298 --> 20:51.733
Vanilla Rice. (laughing)

20:51.734 --> 20:55.436
(laughing)

20:58.707 --> 21:00.909
BOBBY: Daddy!

21:00.910 --> 21:03.044
Oh!

21:03.045 --> 21:05.679
Oh, you need to do
standup comedy, Daddy.
