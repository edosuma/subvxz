00:01.134 --> 00:03.103
Everybody, can I please
have your attention?

00:03.403 --> 00:06.066
Ryan and I have
a huge announcement.

00:06.139 --> 00:08.506
- Oh, my gosh!
- Wow.

00:08.575 --> 00:12.342
Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey
Howard and I got divorced.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.274
Sweet.
Free ring.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.884
Divorced? Just so you know,
it's totally amicable.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.785
We're fine. We don't need
people here to take sides.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.982
The last thing that we
want is any kind of drama.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.284
Wait, I... Can you back up?
What's the story?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.295
We were having a beautiful
weekend in the Poconos.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.228
We were making
love constantly.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.960
We saw the sun rise, and
Ryan was crying a lot.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.467
That's not a relevant detail.
And in the morning,

00:34.535 --> 00:36.026
we walked
by a chapel,

00:36.136 --> 00:38.696
and we stopped suddenly,
and Ryan said,

00:38.772 --> 00:40.764
"I don't think I should be
married to you anymore."

00:42.509 --> 00:45.274
Wait... Sorry, when
did you get married?

00:45.412 --> 00:48.610
Um, like, a week ago. We got really
wasted, and it just felt right.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.082
And you didn't
invite any of us?

00:50.150 --> 00:51.880
We are getting
divorced, Andy!

00:51.952 --> 00:54.080
This is such a raw time.

00:54.154 --> 00:56.089
God, baby, you know, with
people's reactions to this,

00:56.156 --> 00:57.715
I wonder if we
made a mistake.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.484
No, with the messed
up laws in this country,

01:00.561 --> 01:03.793
I don't want to be married
until everyone can be married.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.025
You know what, Ryan?

01:05.098 --> 01:06.691
I talked to the
other gay guys,

01:06.767 --> 01:09.066
and we're okay with it. We all agreed
it's fine for you to get married.

01:09.136 --> 01:12.004
No. No, Oscar.
Not until everyone can.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.433
Ryan,
I changed my mind.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.597
Okay, fine.
You know what?

01:14.675 --> 01:16.109
This actually isn't
amicable at all,

01:16.176 --> 01:18.441
and we actually do need
people to take sides.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.536
Who's on my side?

01:21.415 --> 01:24.146
And who is on my side?

01:49.376 --> 01:51.140
All right, bye.
Bye.

01:51.211 --> 01:52.907
Let's go.
Just a minute!

01:52.980 --> 01:55.211
How long do we have to wait?
For what?

01:55.549 --> 01:56.983
You broke up with
A.J. weeks ago.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.013
Don't you have a
sales call to go on?

01:59.086 --> 02:00.679
I don't understand.
I really don't.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.849
I mean, we know we're gonna start dating.
Why not now?

02:03.924 --> 02:05.358
We don't know that.
Sure we do.

02:05.425 --> 02:07.917
Why is it such a certainty that
we're supposed to be together?

02:07.995 --> 02:09.758
Why does the sun
rise in the morning?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.594
Why do magnets
stick together?

02:11.665 --> 02:13.998
Because everybody
says so. Everybody.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.434
Michael, I can't keep
getting into a situation

02:16.503 --> 02:18.768
where I date whoever
I'm working with.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.464
Well, you could
understand that.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.475
Yeah, I understand.
I just don't agree.

02:22.542 --> 02:25.102
Well, you don't have to agree.
Yes, I do.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.813
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.247
No, you can have
your own opinion,

02:29.316 --> 02:30.579
and I can have mine. I
have my own opinion,

02:30.651 --> 02:32.916
and my opinion is
to disagree with you.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.319
He's gonna be a lot of fun to
drive around in a car with.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.051
Oh, you'll get
through it, hon.

02:37.124 --> 02:40.060
Just make a game out of it.
A funny Jim game.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.587
That's it?
That's all I get?

02:43.664 --> 02:46.190
Even after all the hard work I put
into celebrating your talent today.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.261
All right,
what'd you do?

02:48.335 --> 02:50.600
Well, those things that
you consider doodles,

02:50.671 --> 02:51.798
I consider art.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.876
Where'd you put it?
Where'd I put what?

02:56.943 --> 02:58.809
Let's go.
Oh, sorry. I gotta go.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.210
Say it. Where?
Okay, fine.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.444
Three hints. One, when you're getting
colder, you're really getting warmer.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.917
The fridge.
Two!

03:04.985 --> 03:07.648
You have a better chance
if you think Bob Vance.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.087
The fridge, got it.
And the final clue...

03:09.156 --> 03:10.954
Let's go! You know what?
Just think about it.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.822
You'll be fine.
Bye.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.524
Holly is ruining
Michael's life.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.356
He thinks she's
so special.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.596
And she's so not.

03:22.669 --> 03:26.162
Her personality is like a three,
her sense of humor is a two,

03:26.239 --> 03:29.732
her ears are like
a seven and a four.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.678
Add it all up,
and what do you get? 16.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.908
And he treats her
like she's a perfect 40.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.313
It's nuts.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.290
Cheer up.
We made a sale.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.121
Just drive faster.
I wanna get back.

03:46.193 --> 03:49.391
Well, I'm going the speed limit.
Okay, fine.

03:49.496 --> 03:50.964
My feelings don't
matter to you.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.091
What matters to you is
your precious speed limit.

03:53.900 --> 03:54.890
Someone's in a bad mood.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.368
No, I'm not.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.670
I'm not in
a bad mood.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.669
I'm not,
Jim. Hello?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.680
Okay, fine, ignore me.
Have it your way.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.343
Let's just talk
about you as always.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.414
Sex different after
the baby, Jim?

04:13.487 --> 04:15.683
All right, let me turn on some music.
I need to pee!

04:15.756 --> 04:18.055
No, you don't. Yeah, I do.
My word against yours.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.616
All right, well, we'll
be there in 10 minutes.

04:19.692 --> 04:23.494
What part of "I need to
pee" do you not understand?

04:23.563 --> 04:25.555
I'm upset,
my bladder is full,

04:25.632 --> 04:28.932
there is no telling what
I might do right now

04:29.002 --> 04:31.733
all over the inside of
your precious little car.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.274
All right. Well, if I see a
gas station, I'll pull over.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.207
Well, I hope
I make it.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.208
Hello?
Hi, Jim, it's Helene.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.275
Hey, Helene.
Is everything okay?

04:44.351 --> 04:46.217
Everything's fine.
Baby's fine.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.687
She has a tiny fever. I'm
taking her for a checkup.

04:48.755 --> 04:49.916
Nothing to worry about.

04:50.490 --> 04:51.549
Okay.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.891
A tiny thing. I locked
her in the car.

04:54.961 --> 04:55.951
What?

04:56.029 --> 04:57.964
She's smiling. She's happy.
 Oh, my God.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.398
Jim, I don't have a spare key.
 Oh, my God.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.368
Just stay there. I'll
be there in one second.

05:03.436 --> 05:04.665
Michael!

05:05.806 --> 05:07.035
Michael!

05:08.542 --> 05:10.568
Excuse me, sir, there's a...
There's a guy in the bathroom.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.806
He's coming out, but I have to
go, 'cause it's an emergency.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.370
Will you just tell him
to call the office?

05:14.447 --> 05:16.279
Just call...
Call the office.

05:16.349 --> 05:18.011
Thank you! Please?

05:28.061 --> 05:29.085
Hello?

05:52.552 --> 05:54.077
- This is Pam.
- Hey, it's me.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.316
So, don't worry.
Everything's okay.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.358
What's wrong? Nothing,
absolutely nothing.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.451
But you're not holding a cup of
coffee or anything, are you?

06:00.527 --> 06:04.191
Jim, what? Uh, okay. So, Cece
had a little bit of a fever,

06:04.264 --> 06:06.290
and your mom also
locked her in the car.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.198
Oh, God. What? No,
no, no, it's okay.

06:08.268 --> 06:11.568
So, Cece's with Daddy now, and
she is laughing and she's happy,

06:11.638 --> 06:13.197
and we're on our way
to see Dr. Barbara.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.571
Okay, so she's okay?

06:14.641 --> 06:17.201
Yes, and your mom got a
very well-deserved day off.

06:17.277 --> 06:21.681
So, here's the thing, though, I left
Michael at the gas station on Bennett.

06:21.748 --> 06:22.807
Understood.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.977
And his wallet and phone are
on the seat next to me.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.212
Got it.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.152
I will put
out an A.P.B.,

06:28.221 --> 06:31.214
otherwise known as
an "Ask Pam Beesly."

06:34.327 --> 06:36.387
Did the phone cut out? Nope.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.898
All right, just call me
after the doctor. Okay.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.228
All right, bye.
Bye.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.162
I know, I know. You have a phone policy.
I understand.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.001
But this is an emergency,
because my friend isn't here,

06:46.072 --> 06:49.634
and I'm worried that
he has been abducted.

06:49.809 --> 06:50.936
No.
And...

06:51.011 --> 06:53.640
No, he ditched you, man.
I saw him drive away.

06:53.713 --> 06:55.341
There's no way
he ditched me.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.713
There's no way
that happened.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.753
He's my... Okay. May I please
just use your phone? Please?

07:00.086 --> 07:01.782
Just make it quick.
Thank you. Okay.

07:01.888 --> 07:04.551
I will make it quick.
I will make it very quick.

07:04.624 --> 07:07.617
And you don't have my
numbers on speed dial.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.097
Okay, what is it?

07:11.197 --> 07:13.530
You don't know. You don't...
You know what?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.569
I could dial 411,
get Jim's number...

07:15.635 --> 07:18.298
He left you here
on purpose,

07:18.371 --> 07:19.737
all right? I saw it.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.141
He just drove away.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.335
Actually,
this is good.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.847
I am going to take
this opportunity

07:26.913 --> 07:28.506
to go walk about.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.116
Good, good.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.989
No, get away.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.718
No. That's enough.

07:38.758 --> 07:39.851
Okay.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.789
Okay.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.294
It's the gas station on
Bennett Street? Yeah.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.062
You know what? Why don't
you stay and I'll go?

07:49.135 --> 07:50.694
Oh, no, no, no,
I'll be fine.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.433
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood,
though. I better come along.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.207
Problem solved,
everyone.

07:55.275 --> 07:58.439
Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop
are off to rescue Michael.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.707
Unbelievable.
I'm going.

08:00.780 --> 08:04.273
You drive. I got a
car full of fox meat.

08:06.753 --> 08:07.846
Cute.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.492
Very funny, everyone.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.121
Who wrote captions
under my doodle?

08:18.231 --> 08:20.257
I'm not even kidding.
They're pretty good.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.199
Which one in particular?
Yeah, which one?

08:22.268 --> 08:25.568
Well, the first one
has a surprise factor.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.504
"I'm a suck, suck,
suckity Sabre."

08:27.640 --> 08:28.699
Booya!

08:28.775 --> 08:31.438
No. No, no.
No, no, no.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.811
But I suppose the second one
is the better written line.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.941
You suppose?
What's it say?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.815
"I'm supposed to
be wearing red gloves,

08:38.885 --> 08:41.616
"but my color cartridge
portal got jammed again."

08:41.788 --> 08:44.417
Okay. No, no,
no, no, no.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.823
Gloves.
Keep it real.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.088
You guys, if I knew you wanted
to do a caption contest,

08:48.161 --> 08:49.652
I would have drawn something
more challenging.

08:49.729 --> 08:52.756
And I will take you all down.
You?

08:53.166 --> 08:54.600
I've been reading the
comics to my daughter

08:54.667 --> 08:56.067
since she was
three years old.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.867
Not once have I used the real
captions to Family Circus.

08:58.938 --> 09:02.568
That crazy family is hilarious
to her for one reason, me.

09:02.976 --> 09:07.539
It is on like Genghis Khan
wearing Sean John in Bhutan.

09:07.614 --> 09:10.140
Yes. You guys,
I have the perfect idea.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.481
Okay, it'll just take
me 10 minutes.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.384
- All right.
- I want to do it.

09:14.454 --> 09:19.984
Male, Caucasian, 40s, black
hair, facial type, marsupial.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.120
He answers to Michael,
Michael G. Scott,

09:22.195 --> 09:24.562
Michael J. Fox, Mr. Fox,
the Incredible Mr. Fox...

09:24.631 --> 09:26.463
Yeah, he just left.
Which way did he go?

09:26.533 --> 09:28.866
Okay, hey, hey, hey,
let me answer this.

09:28.935 --> 09:32.303
Stupid question. He went back to the
office, obviously, which is that way.

09:32.372 --> 09:36.173
Oh, really? You don't think he walked by
that bakery just for the smell of it?

09:37.210 --> 09:39.008
She's right.
He went that way.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.043
All right.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.677
Don't get a swelled head.
You're no tracker.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.118
Let's ride.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.336
Hey, you guys.
Listen to me.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.739
Don't get hung up
on just one girl,

10:08.808 --> 10:11.471
because there are a lot
of other girls out there.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.308
Look over there. See?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.405
They look cute.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.383
Hello.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.612
You guys are
so beautiful.

10:19.686 --> 10:20.813
You're so colorful.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.086
I wish I could
understand you.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.359
That's a metaphor,
I guess.

10:26.926 --> 10:30.624
You are disgusting.
You'll never find love.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.967
Do you think she needs more time,
or it's just never gonna happen?

10:35.034 --> 10:37.162
I'm being serious.
Seriously.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.536
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
 Has Michael checked in?

10:39.706 --> 10:42.141
Oh, hey, Dwight. I
asked you a question.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.972
No, he hasn't.
Okay, bye.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.773
No, wait. Hey,
while you're out,

10:45.845 --> 10:48.076
could you pick up some paper
towels and chocolate syrup?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.446
We have ice cream,
so I thought we could...

10:49.516 --> 10:50.916
Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.
No.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.816
This is a
manhunt/rescue mission.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.685
Okay, I just... When you're done,
or any time it's convenient,

10:55.755 --> 10:56.848
I just thought
since you're out...

10:56.923 --> 10:59.415
Pam, I'm obviously gonna get that
stuff for you, so just shut up. God.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.461
Okay, well, it wasn't...

11:03.396 --> 11:05.194
No word from Michael.

11:07.066 --> 11:08.056
Ta-daa!

11:08.601 --> 11:13.198
Okay, it's two giant dogs
with two giant palm trees

11:13.273 --> 11:15.003
on a regular-sized island.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.372
Oh, I got one.
Yeah?

11:16.743 --> 11:18.268
Yes. Okay, I'm sorry,

11:18.344 --> 11:19.903
but I'm gonna have
to shut this down.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.340
Why?

11:21.414 --> 11:23.781
Unless we can all agree
to some ground rules.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.476
It's either that, or
I can fax this to Jo

11:26.553 --> 11:27.953
and let her decide
how to proceed.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.958
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules
so we can start the game.

11:32.091 --> 11:33.957
Number one, and this
should be obvious,

11:34.027 --> 11:36.394
no captions that insult
the company we work for.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.226
Irony is such
a critical...

11:38.298 --> 11:39.960
Number two,

11:40.033 --> 11:42.434
no pop
culture references.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.027
Seriously?
Wow.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.299
I think we can all agree
they tend to alienate those

11:46.372 --> 11:49.308
who don't get the reference,
making them feel like the other.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.809
Wrap it up, Gabe.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.346
Okay, final thing,
and this is a fun one,

11:53.413 --> 11:55.973
instead of writing the caption
directly under the picture,

11:57.350 --> 11:59.216
let's all try using
Sticky Quips.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.811
All right? New from
Dunder Mifflin Sabre.

12:01.888 --> 12:05.825
Sticky Quips are fun. They're safe.
They're handy.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.918
I like to use Sticky Quips
as regular Post-it notes

12:07.994 --> 12:10.054
when I'm in
a fun mood.

12:10.129 --> 12:11.495
Not every day.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.328
Go get 'em.
Start quipping.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.523
Hmm.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.898
Pam, I think I'm
gonna send you an IM.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.029
Oh, okay.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.041
Send me one, too. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, put me on that.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.940
- Cc.
- Ditto.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.980
Hello. I would like
a hot dog, please.

12:29.515 --> 12:30.608
Now, I don't have any money,

12:31.117 --> 12:33.109
so here is what
I would like to do.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.951
I leave you here
with my watch,

12:36.022 --> 12:38.423
and I come back later
and I pay for the hot dog.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.857
I'm not a pawn shop.

12:39.926 --> 12:43.693
Well, I understand that,
but this is a $45 watch.

12:43.763 --> 12:47.632
Wow. With that, I could
buy half the menu.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.099
I can't just go giving away hot dogs.
All right.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.769
What do you do with the hot
dogs that you don't sell?

12:52.839 --> 12:54.364
Throw 'em away.
Well, okay,

12:54.440 --> 12:55.772
instead of throwing
them all away later,

12:55.842 --> 12:57.936
why don't you just throw one
away now into my mouth?

12:58.244 --> 12:59.268
No.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.837
Okay. You've just
lost my business.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.382
Hey. Hey, you were
in there forever.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.461
There's too many
brands. Where's Holly?

13:14.560 --> 13:16.859
She wandered
off like an idiot.

13:17.930 --> 13:18.954
Hey.
Hey.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.661
What are you doing? Just
changing my cell phone plan.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.896
Okay. Okay.
Here you go.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.033
I'll take my free
stress ball too now.

13:26.105 --> 13:28.074
Sure thing.
Here you go, Miss...

13:28.141 --> 13:30.110
Okay, Fanny Smellmore.

13:30.176 --> 13:31.644
Real original.
What?

13:31.711 --> 13:34.146
You know what? Say hi to
Orville Tootenbacher for me.

13:34.213 --> 13:35.681
Tootenbacher.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.717
Orville Tootenbacher, that's
Michael's millionaire character that

13:38.785 --> 13:40.219
farts popcorn.
Farts popcorn.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.221
Of course.
He was here.

13:42.288 --> 13:44.382
She's the key.
Amazing.

13:46.693 --> 13:47.854
Holly.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.555
Hey, where would
you like to go next?

13:51.264 --> 13:52.425
Holly?

13:55.435 --> 13:57.961
Are their egg rolls
really that big?

13:58.705 --> 14:01.174
Oh, boy. That was yummy.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.038
Thank you so much.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.311
You know what? I think I
left my wallet in my car.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.614
Do you mind if
I run out and get it?

14:13.686 --> 14:14.847
No problem.
Okay.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.118
I'll be right back.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.397
God! Okay,
you know what?

14:24.464 --> 14:25.932
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.703
I don't have my wallet.
And I was...

14:31.771 --> 14:35.037
I was gonna try to dine and
dash, and that was stupid,

14:35.108 --> 14:37.304
and I realize I can't do
that to you fine people.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.640
So, you can't pay
for your food?

14:38.711 --> 14:41.840
Well, I can, but I will have
to come back later tonight

14:41.914 --> 14:43.610
and pay you.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.948
But the point is I
did the right thing.

14:46.085 --> 14:47.348
You did not.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.787
You have no money, but you
dined, and you dined so much.

14:49.856 --> 14:53.190
Well, the number three
is not such a giant feast.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.920
Mr. Choo!
Okay.

14:54.994 --> 14:56.553
All right.
You know what?

14:56.629 --> 15:00.088
You're trying to steal food from us?
I am not.

15:00.166 --> 15:03.000
I just have had
a bad day, and I...

15:04.570 --> 15:07.904
Okay. I'll be back later with the money.
I'm just gonna leave right now.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.203
You can't.
We'll stop you.

15:09.275 --> 15:12.074
Well, I think I can
get through the door.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.712
Excuse me,
do you speak English?

15:21.220 --> 15:22.848
We are looking
for a man,

15:22.922 --> 15:26.450
Michael, this tall,
black hair, Caucasian.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.994
It's Michael!

15:31.364 --> 15:32.798
He just left.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.528
You knew.
What?

15:35.601 --> 15:37.399
No. Dwight asked if
I wanted an egg roll.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.938
What... What are
you implying?

15:39.071 --> 15:40.733
Uncanny.

15:40.807 --> 15:41.866
Put a pin in that.

15:41.941 --> 15:42.965
Which way did he go?

15:44.310 --> 15:46.404
That guy,
when he leave here,

15:46.479 --> 15:49.381
which way did he go?
We looking for him.

15:49.449 --> 15:53.011
This way? This way? This way?
I don't know. Do you know?

15:53.085 --> 15:54.713
I think he was
heading downtown.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.422
He's heading downtown.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.389
So what, no one's
even gonna try?

16:06.065 --> 16:07.590
Guess not.
Oh, come on.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.495
My rules could not possibly
have been that oppressive.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.368
You crushed
our spirits, Gabe.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.169
Congrats. You're
a big man, huh?

16:15.908 --> 16:19.777
Takes a lot to destroy the creativity
of a whole group of people.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.380
Hey...

16:33.326 --> 16:35.352
Click the "X."
I'm clicking!

16:35.428 --> 16:37.294
In the box.
I am clicking.

16:37.363 --> 16:39.264
Woman, you've had a computer for years!
Phyllis!

16:39.332 --> 16:40.356
Too late!

16:41.534 --> 16:45.835
Oh, huh, an IM chat. Very clever.
I'll just print that out.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.102
Come on, guys.
Grow up.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.835
I don't want to
be your babysitter.

17:11.998 --> 17:15.093
"Darn it, Bob, I told you not
to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat."

17:17.103 --> 17:18.799
- Nice!
- No, not nice.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.305
Terrible.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.398
Doesn't even include
the fact that they're dogs.

17:22.474 --> 17:24.376
Do the next one.
"Wake up, Fred.

17:24.443 --> 17:27.607
"The power cord on your Sabre
printer shocked you into a coma,

17:27.680 --> 17:29.842
"and you're dreaming you're
a dog on a desert island."

17:30.049 --> 17:32.450
Dreaming he's a dog
on an island.

17:33.152 --> 17:34.313
Uh, excuse me,
excuse me.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.947
How does the speaker know what
the guy in the coma is dreaming?

17:37.023 --> 17:39.322
Well, if you think it's so easy,
Gabe, why don't you try it?

17:39.825 --> 17:40.815
Um...

17:41.394 --> 17:43.829
You don't have to sniff
my rear end anymore, Bob.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.626
I'm the only
one here.

17:45.698 --> 17:46.961
That's tasteless, Gabe.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.433
Tasteless?
Tasteless.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.560
More tasteless
than this?

17:49.635 --> 17:52.195
"Is that a palm tree,
or did Gabe get skinnier?

17:52.271 --> 17:53.637
"Either way,
let's pee on it."

17:53.973 --> 17:55.532
I like that.

17:58.110 --> 18:00.375
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think we have a winner.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.074
Yes. Yes. Well done!

18:02.248 --> 18:03.807
Whose is it?
Who wrote that?

18:04.216 --> 18:05.946
Yeah. Who wrote it?

18:07.987 --> 18:12.448
Please. It was easy once I decided
I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.556
Where did he
go, Holly?

18:15.661 --> 18:17.152
I have no idea.

18:17.229 --> 18:19.824
Do you see a little clown
that you wanna follow, huh?

18:19.899 --> 18:22.733
Is there a little bird that's chirping
to you, "This way, this way"?

18:22.802 --> 18:24.395
I don't know.

18:24.470 --> 18:25.665
Okay. Close your eyes.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.867
We need you to think. What
is Michael seeing right now?

18:29.442 --> 18:30.933
Can you tell him
that we miss him?

18:31.010 --> 18:32.171
Michael, we're
coming for you!

18:32.244 --> 18:33.234
Will you stop?

18:33.312 --> 18:35.747
There have been a few
coincidences, that's all!

18:36.148 --> 18:37.514
All right, then.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.711
Someone propose a plan. Okay.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.981
We fan out...
Not you, Erin.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.613
Stop looking
at me like that.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.854
Okay, look, let's just
go up somewhere high

18:47.927 --> 18:49.793
and see if we could spot
him on the street below.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.329
That is the stupidest
idea I've ever heard. No.

18:52.398 --> 18:55.698
Tap into your common mind, and
tell us what he would do next.

18:55.768 --> 18:59.068
Look, I'm not playing.
I'm gonna go look for him.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.739
Good. We don't need her. Right.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.277
I can do this on my own.
I can think like Michael.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.506
All right...

19:07.580 --> 19:09.981
I'm deep below the ocean's
surface in a submarine.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.483
A torpedo's coming
right at me.

19:12.318 --> 19:15.254
No. Damn it, that's
just my own imagination.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.686
Maybe he's bowling.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.755
Michael?

19:57.630 --> 19:58.654
Hi.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.669
How did you know
I was up here?

20:03.736 --> 20:04.999
What are you
doing up here?

20:05.071 --> 20:06.095
I got turned around.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.368
I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
Dunder Mifflin?

20:09.775 --> 20:11.471
Yeah.

20:11.744 --> 20:12.803
Wow!

20:17.016 --> 20:19.008
I just miss
you so much.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.850
I missed you, too.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.121
Really?

20:29.428 --> 20:30.555
Yeah.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.392
Can I kiss you?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.301
Yeah.
Okay.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.282
Maybe that's not the
best one. Keep reading.

20:49.348 --> 20:51.044
Yeah, it was.
Maybe it wasn't.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.109
"Oh, thank God, I had
a horrible nightmare

20:53.185 --> 20:55.245
"that I was stuck
in America with Gabe."

20:57.857 --> 21:00.190
No, that's not the one I was thinking of.
Keep going.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.727
"I know what it smells like,
but I didn't roll in anything.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.594
"It's from listening
to all of Gabe's..."

21:07.199 --> 21:09.691
"Isn't this the perfect
romantic getaway, Erin?

21:09.769 --> 21:12.671
"Sitting on a desert
island in dog costumes?

21:12.738 --> 21:14.934
"I'm Gabe,
and I'm a weirdo."

21:17.042 --> 21:19.978
"Gabe's mom.
Hmm, Gabe's mom?

21:20.045 --> 21:22.446
"Wait, tall woman?
Looks like Gabe?

21:24.216 --> 21:25.275
"Yeah, I banged her."

21:25.351 --> 21:27.081
Yeah, there you go.
