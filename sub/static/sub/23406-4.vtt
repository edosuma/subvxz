WEBVTT

00:07.172 --> 00:09.172
- Imagine a forest.

00:09.275 --> 00:10.827
You're chopping wood,

00:10.931 --> 00:12.689
immersed in nature,

00:12.793 --> 00:15.586
removed from
the oppressive modern world.

00:15.689 --> 00:20.965
Pure, organic
salt, sweat, and hops.

00:21.068 --> 00:22.379
You reach for a brew,

00:22.482 --> 00:23.793
but you don't want
a regular beer

00:23.896 --> 00:25.517
brewed by soulless machines.

00:25.620 --> 00:28.379
You want something
crafted by hand,

00:28.482 --> 00:31.379
because you're unique,
different from other people.

00:31.482 --> 00:33.586
Better.
You're a special man.

00:33.689 --> 00:35.655
Imagine the heart and soul
of a 1,000-year-old tree.

00:35.758 --> 00:37.448
Imagine an apple
that tastes like God.

00:37.551 --> 00:39.137
Imagine the Patriot Act
never existed.

00:39.241 --> 00:42.448
Imagine true freedom.
Congrats.

00:42.551 --> 00:45.620
You've now imagined
Matt's Brew.

00:45.724 --> 00:46.724
Imagine an eagle.

00:46.827 --> 00:49.965
Because beer can be better.

00:50.068 --> 00:51.482
So what'd you think?

00:51.586 --> 00:54.137
- I think brewing your own beer
is a sign of a lost person.

00:54.241 --> 00:56.896
- Jake, it's me inside
this bottle,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.517
and I want you to taste me.

00:59.620 --> 01:02.344
- No, I don't like beer.

01:02.448 --> 01:07.034
- I don't like beer either,
but this is craft brew.

01:07.137 --> 01:09.379
- You are acting
like a frat guy.

01:09.482 --> 01:12.655
- Craft brew is a rebellion
against frat culture.

01:12.758 --> 01:14.655
- No means no!

01:14.758 --> 01:16.689
- No!

01:16.793 --> 01:17.827
My brew...

01:38.344 --> 01:40.758
- The infamous graffiti artist
known as TradeMarq

01:40.862 --> 01:42.275
has struck again.

01:42.379 --> 01:45.034
We may not know his identity,
but we certainly know his work.

01:45.137 --> 01:46.413
He's lambasted businesses

01:46.517 --> 01:47.931
and governments
across the world

01:48.034 --> 01:50.931
with his satirical street art
and subversive epigrams.

01:51.034 --> 01:52.275
TradeMarq has been referred to

01:52.379 --> 01:54.586
as the faceless face
of counterculture.

01:54.689 --> 01:57.275
His latest target?
Hampton DeVille.

01:57.379 --> 01:59.068
Last night, TradeMarq tagged

01:59.172 --> 02:00.413
their Midwest
corporate headquarters

02:00.517 --> 02:02.689
in solidarity with the protest
over Hampton DeVille's

02:02.793 --> 02:05.344
controversial use
of super fracking.

02:05.448 --> 02:08.724
Super fracking pulls
15% more oil out of bedrock,

02:08.827 --> 02:11.655
while poisoning groundwater
for 12 square miles.

02:11.758 --> 02:13.965
This has prompted
a fierce backlash.

02:34.862 --> 02:36.482
- Fuck Hampton DeVille!

02:48.724 --> 02:51.103
- Can you believe TradeMarq
tagged the building we work in?

02:51.206 --> 02:54.068
He was actually here.
He's my favorite artist.

02:54.172 --> 02:55.793
- So you're a part of
the craft beer movement,

02:55.896 --> 02:58.000
and now you're telling me
you think street art is cool.

02:58.103 --> 02:59.862
Let me guess,
you're also into vinyl.

02:59.965 --> 03:01.310
- Yeah, well,
the sound is warmer.

03:01.413 --> 03:03.241
- Street art lost
all its integrity years ago.

03:03.344 --> 03:04.896
It got co-opted
and commercialized,

03:05.000 --> 03:06.448
just like the presidency.

03:18.413 --> 03:19.724
- On my way into work today,

03:19.827 --> 03:23.379
a protester threw
a mango smoothie at me.

03:23.482 --> 03:27.448
Now, this 24-ounce smoothie
was purchased from Smiley Juice,

03:27.551 --> 03:29.241
a quick-service
health food retailer

03:29.344 --> 03:34.068
that happens to be
a subsidiary of Hampton DeVille.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.172
That protester
may not have known it,

03:36.275 --> 03:38.551
but he's our customer.

03:38.655 --> 03:41.344
I look out there,
and do you know what I see?

03:41.448 --> 03:43.103
-  People I've muted
on social media.

03:43.206 --> 03:48.793
- I see an untapped market.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.448
Protesters are hypocrites.

03:51.551 --> 03:53.896
Oh, they hate corporations,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.586
but they love buying the things
that corporations make

03:56.689 --> 03:58.517
with their mommy's credit card.

03:58.620 --> 04:02.068
And we are going to turn
these anarchists into customers.

04:02.172 --> 04:04.758
But first,
I want to meet TradeMarq.

04:04.862 --> 04:07.931
- Oh, uh, with all due respect,
Mr. DeVille,

04:08.034 --> 04:10.965
TradeMarq is impossible to find.

04:11.068 --> 04:13.413
- Nobody has ever seen
his actual face before,

04:13.517 --> 04:16.344
except for maybe his mom,
but nobody knows who his mom is.

04:16.448 --> 04:18.344
- Just find him.
- Got it.

04:18.448 --> 04:19.931
- Oh, in the meantime,

04:20.034 --> 04:22.482
get a Hampton DeVille
food truck down there.

04:22.586 --> 04:25.517
Idiots love food trucks.

04:27.551 --> 04:30.413
- This food truck is awesome.
They have Sriracha mayo.

04:30.517 --> 04:32.103
I'd bathe in Sriracha mayo

04:32.206 --> 04:34.689
is I wasn't so afraid of
what it would do to my privates.

04:34.793 --> 04:37.448
- How did people even survive
before Sriracha mayo?

04:37.551 --> 04:39.724
- Sriracha mayo!
- This line is ridiculous.

04:39.827 --> 04:41.068
Can we please
just go to Chili's?

04:41.172 --> 04:42.310
- Jake, come on.

04:42.413 --> 04:43.724
There's a real energy
out here, okay?

04:43.827 --> 04:45.793
We're a part of something.
- No, we are not.

04:45.896 --> 04:47.827
These people have no idea
what they're talking about.

04:47.931 --> 04:49.206
They're protesting oil,

04:49.310 --> 04:51.241
but they drove their cars
to get here, which run on oil.

04:51.344 --> 04:52.862
Or they rode their bikes.
Bikes have gears.

04:52.965 --> 04:54.310
Oil.
Their phones? Oil.

04:54.413 --> 04:55.482
Their hair?
Oil.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.413
- Oh, my God, is that Richard?

04:57.517 --> 05:00.206
- What are you tools
of the oppressors doing here?

05:00.310 --> 05:01.724
- We're buying overrated,
overpriced food

05:01.827 --> 05:03.172
cooked in a truck.
How are you?

05:03.275 --> 05:06.689
- I read an Internet article
on super fracking, and it's bad.

05:06.793 --> 05:09.068
You people should be ashamed
to work for Hampton DeVille.

05:09.172 --> 05:10.931
I was, which is why I quit.

05:11.034 --> 05:13.896
- You were fired.
I did your exit interview.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.103
- I actually agree with you.

05:15.206 --> 05:16.448
I don't like
corporate stuff either.

05:16.551 --> 05:18.275
That's why I started
brewing my own beer.

05:18.379 --> 05:20.000
Here, have one.

05:21.551 --> 05:23.862
No!

05:42.206 --> 05:44.034
I'm here to see TradeMarq.

05:44.137 --> 05:45.896
He's expecting me.

05:49.793 --> 05:51.655
You've vandalized my company,

05:51.758 --> 05:53.206
you've insulted me personally,

05:53.310 --> 05:58.068
and you've incited a protest
against everything I stand for.

05:58.172 --> 06:02.448
But I don't want
to be your enemy.

06:02.551 --> 06:05.448
You represent
the counterculture.

06:05.551 --> 06:07.517
What I bring to you today
is a counteroffer

06:07.620 --> 06:10.724
to the counterculture,
a partnership.

06:10.827 --> 06:13.689
You design a line of
anti-Hampton DeVille products,

06:13.793 --> 06:18.827
and we handle the manufacturing
and distribution.

06:21.034 --> 06:23.206
- Huh.
Maybe.

06:23.310 --> 06:24.862
Jill, what do you think?

06:24.965 --> 06:28.448
- I think being anti-brand
is really on-brand for you.

06:28.551 --> 06:30.620
Hampton DeVille
is particularly evil,

06:30.724 --> 06:32.620
and that works to our advantage.

06:32.724 --> 06:35.517
- Uh-huh.
Harold, any concerns?

06:35.620 --> 06:37.000
- Honestly, I hear Kanye West

06:37.103 --> 06:39.689
recently signed a partnership
with Monsanto,

06:39.793 --> 06:42.241
so I think we're living in
a brave new world.

06:42.344 --> 06:45.000
I don't imagine any backlash.

06:45.103 --> 06:47.517
- I spent the last decade
sneaking around at night,

06:47.620 --> 06:49.344
climbing buildings,
and evading cops,

06:49.448 --> 06:51.724
and can I be honest with you?

06:51.827 --> 06:52.931
I'm tired.

06:53.034 --> 06:54.448
I think a more structured
work environment

06:54.551 --> 06:56.310
might be good for me.

07:06.068 --> 07:07.379
- Get the Executive!

07:11.758 --> 07:13.379
No! No!

07:13.482 --> 07:14.827
No! No! Please!

07:14.931 --> 07:16.620
No! No! No!

07:20.827 --> 07:23.275
And that's what plays
in my brain on a constant loop.

07:23.379 --> 07:24.827
- Super fracking is my baby,

07:24.931 --> 07:26.482
and they want to
make my baby illegal.

07:26.586 --> 07:27.931
If those protesters break in,

07:28.034 --> 07:29.965
I am going to come at them
like one of those moms

07:30.068 --> 07:32.310
that lifts an entire car
to save her kid.

07:32.413 --> 07:33.344
- Whenever those moms do that,

07:33.448 --> 07:34.827
I get so worried
about their backs.

07:34.931 --> 07:36.379
- Mm.

07:41.448 --> 07:44.034
- Hey, do you guys know where
the 2:00 p.m. pitch meeting is?

07:47.482 --> 07:49.689
- So, anyway,
she didn't want to try my brew.

07:49.793 --> 07:50.758
And then we watched
a documentary

07:50.862 --> 07:52.206
about the top ten genocides,

07:52.310 --> 07:55.103
and sat on opposite sides
of the couch, and did not kiss.

07:55.206 --> 07:58.000
It was the best date I've had
in a really long time.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.586
- Well, it's good you're putting
yourself out there.

08:05.655 --> 08:08.620
Oh, brews in the office.
Hell yeah.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.344
Ah.

08:14.448 --> 08:16.862
Hey,
you're the guy from this beer.

08:16.965 --> 08:19.344
Ha.
- You're TradeMarq.

08:19.448 --> 08:20.724
- Allegedly.

08:20.827 --> 08:23.448
I mean, I'm wearing a mask.

08:23.551 --> 08:25.689
- We're all wearing masks
in our own way,

08:25.793 --> 08:27.000
if you really think about it.

08:27.103 --> 08:29.310
- Yeah.
- But, yeah, it's me, TradeMarq.

08:29.413 --> 08:31.241
- Hi, I'm Man--Matt.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.275
I meant "Matt."

08:32.379 --> 08:33.275
Nobody's name's Man.

08:33.379 --> 08:34.482
- So you're a brewmaster?

08:34.586 --> 08:36.413
That is tight.
- Yeah.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.482
- I love hops.
- I-I love hops.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.379
I mean, IPAs are sort of
an acquired taste,

08:40.482 --> 08:41.827
but I've already acquired it,

08:41.931 --> 08:43.517
so that's kind of
where I'm at right now.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.034
- Yeah, man, cool.

08:45.137 --> 08:46.689
I'm designing a lot of
anti-corporate products

08:46.793 --> 08:48.551
for Hampton DeVille,
and today's my first day.

08:48.655 --> 08:50.137
Would you mind showing me
around the office?

08:50.241 --> 08:51.724
- Yeah, uh, I'll show you
anything you want.

08:51.827 --> 08:53.137
- Oh, great, lead the way.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.655
- It'd be--honestly,
it'd be a honor for me.

08:54.758 --> 08:55.793
Real--really cool to meet you,

08:55.896 --> 08:58.275
and you're a great person
that I like.

08:58.379 --> 09:01.103
- Well, I definitely hate
what just happened there.

09:01.206 --> 09:02.551
- He reminds me of
every guy I dated

09:02.655 --> 09:04.689
before I had self-esteem.

09:04.793 --> 09:06.000
- All right, so we're liking

09:06.103 --> 09:08.689
the "Corporations Are Evil"
coffee mugs

09:08.793 --> 09:10.689
and the "Stop Drilling" condoms.

09:10.793 --> 09:13.000
And we're all onboard
with the T-shirts that say

09:13.103 --> 09:15.137
"Fuck Hampton DeVille"?
- I love it.

09:15.241 --> 09:17.689
Fuck my company.
Ooh, that'll sell like crazy.

09:17.793 --> 09:20.689
- TradeMarq is such a sellout.
I mean, I am too,

09:20.793 --> 09:22.310
but he's not me,
so I hate him for it.

09:22.413 --> 09:25.034
- He's not a sellout.
The only way to beat the system

09:25.137 --> 09:26.896
is to turn the system
against itself.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.827
- And we got Frisbees
with my catchphrase,

09:28.931 --> 09:30.034
"The Only Way To Beat The System

09:30.137 --> 09:33.965
Is To Turn The System
Against Itself."

09:34.068 --> 09:35.275
- See?

09:35.379 --> 09:37.034
- Your entire personality
is stolen from a think piece.

09:37.137 --> 09:39.517
- Hey, what about
glow sticks and sack hacky?

09:39.620 --> 09:41.689
- Kate, amazing.

09:41.793 --> 09:43.862
You know, in my art,
I sometimes find

09:43.965 --> 09:46.482
it's the absolute worst ideas

09:46.586 --> 09:48.551
that make the most
gigantic flowers.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.137
- I have an idea.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.034
Uh, why don't we just turn this
whole protest into Coachella?

09:52.137 --> 09:53.517
We could book some shitty bands,

09:53.620 --> 09:56.034
charge $8 for a bottle of water
with TradeMarq's face on it,

09:56.137 --> 09:58.551
and hold a pillow down over
the face of artistic integrity.

09:58.655 --> 09:59.724
- That just reminded me
of something

09:59.827 --> 10:01.655
I've been wanting to bring up.

10:01.758 --> 10:04.068
Craft brew.

10:05.206 --> 10:06.620
- I don't know
if you guys know this,

10:06.724 --> 10:10.620
but Matt here is a brewmaster.

10:10.724 --> 10:12.000
- Uh...

10:12.103 --> 10:12.862
Yeah, uh, no.

10:12.965 --> 10:14.034
I mean, it's just a hobby

10:14.137 --> 10:16.103
that sort of completely
defines my identity.

10:16.206 --> 10:18.758
- Matt, why don't you tell
everyone here about your brew?

10:18.862 --> 10:21.896
- Oh, um...okay.

10:25.862 --> 10:27.862
Everybody close your eyes.

10:29.689 --> 10:32.689
Imagine you're in a forest,

10:32.793 --> 10:34.793
and you're chopping wood.

10:34.896 --> 10:37.448
You're chopping,
and you're chopping.

10:37.551 --> 10:39.482
You're chopping so hard.

10:39.586 --> 10:41.862
And why can't
you stop chopping?

10:41.965 --> 10:43.068
It seems like something

10:43.172 --> 10:44.862
that you could voluntarily
turn on and off,

10:44.965 --> 10:48.034
but here you are
just deforesting

10:48.137 --> 10:50.827
the natural habitat for animals

10:50.931 --> 10:53.862
that need these trees
way more than you do.

10:53.965 --> 10:56.482
And you feel at home
in the forest.

10:56.586 --> 10:57.896
And you never want
to leave there,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.275
because that's where
you make your brew.

11:00.379 --> 11:01.551
It's like a tree,

11:01.655 --> 11:04.137
crafted like God
would craft a tree,

11:04.241 --> 11:06.448
except you're a man
making beer.

11:06.551 --> 11:09.655
And what's God even have to do
with any of this anyway?

11:09.758 --> 11:10.793
Get out of here, God.

11:10.896 --> 11:12.103
What are you doing here
right now?

11:12.206 --> 11:14.000
Go back to Heaven,
where you belong.

11:14.103 --> 11:16.586
- You like what people like.

11:16.689 --> 11:18.655
Oh, hi, bird.

11:22.862 --> 11:24.206
- Okay, pitch needs some work,

11:24.310 --> 11:27.655
but I got a gut feeling
about this concept.

11:27.758 --> 11:29.896
Let's get Matt's
craft brew recipe down to R&D,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.482
and start marketing it to
those protesters, huh?

11:33.586 --> 11:36.758
Matt, buddy,
you killed it in there.

11:38.862 --> 11:41.517
Wow, this feels good.

11:41.620 --> 11:42.758
For the first time in my life,

11:42.862 --> 11:44.448
somebody finally understands
my passion.

11:44.551 --> 11:46.724
- Matt, TradeMarq doesn't care
about you or your beer.

11:46.827 --> 11:48.172
He's clearly using you.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.448
- Jake, TradeMarq and I
understand each other,

11:50.551 --> 11:52.379
because unlike you,
we're artists.

11:52.482 --> 11:54.241
I'm gonna channel
all of your negativity and doubt

11:54.344 --> 11:55.482
into my brew.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.620
- Stop calling it "brew."

11:59.724 --> 12:02.965
- It is now the third week
of Hampton DeVille protests,

12:03.068 --> 12:05.206
and they're showing
no signs of slowing down.

12:05.310 --> 12:08.172
In solidarity with
this now nationwide movement,

12:08.275 --> 12:11.689
TradeMarq has released a line of
anti-Hampton DeVille products

12:11.793 --> 12:13.310
that are selling
as fast as you can s--

12:13.413 --> 12:14.965
- Fuck Hampton DeVille!

12:15.068 --> 12:16.724
TradeMarq for President!

12:16.827 --> 12:18.931
But also the government
should be taken down!

12:19.034 --> 12:20.551
No more presidents!

12:28.896 --> 12:29.793
- ♪ Hey

12:31.620 --> 12:32.689
♪ Hey

12:34.517 --> 12:35.551
♪ Ho

12:37.068 --> 12:39.034
- Could I hang out with you
and TradeMarq sometime?

12:39.137 --> 12:41.344
I'd really like to
touch his mask.

12:41.448 --> 12:42.827
- A lot of people are trying to
hang out with us right now,

12:42.931 --> 12:44.551
but, um, I'll see what I can do.

12:46.655 --> 12:48.103
My boy.

13:03.931 --> 13:05.103
- Thanks for hanging out
with me so much

13:05.206 --> 13:06.793
since Matt was seduced by
the siren's call

13:06.896 --> 13:08.517
of a mediocre street artist.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.931
- No problem, but also
I don't really have a choice.

13:11.034 --> 13:12.241
You keep showing up
wherever I am

13:12.344 --> 13:14.034
and talking to me
about how you're mad.

13:14.137 --> 13:15.068
- Yeah, I feel like
our friendship's

13:15.172 --> 13:16.344
really blossoming too.

13:16.448 --> 13:18.344
- And that's when I told
Lady Gaga,

13:18.448 --> 13:19.896
"No, you text me."

13:21.620 --> 13:23.000
She texted me.
She did.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.241
- I've had enough.

13:24.344 --> 13:26.103
The infatuation with this guy
is unreasonable.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.758
Nobody is that interesting.

13:27.862 --> 13:29.379
I'm gonna say something.
- Don't do it.

13:29.482 --> 13:31.172
You don't have the social clout
to face him.

13:31.275 --> 13:33.103
Jake!
- I see how it works.

13:33.206 --> 13:35.103
We all work side by side
for years,

13:35.206 --> 13:36.862
then some fraud
in a loser mask shows up,

13:36.965 --> 13:38.586
and suddenly
he's everyone's best friend.

13:38.689 --> 13:41.931
Greg, I'd expect this from you.
But Fred, Laura?

13:42.034 --> 13:44.034
I thought our friendship
meant something.

13:44.137 --> 13:46.206
- Those aren't
any of their names.

13:46.310 --> 13:48.103
- Face it,
you're just a rip-off artist,

13:48.206 --> 13:51.586
and you probably wear that mask
'cause you have an ugly face.

13:54.206 --> 13:56.034
- Actually, Jake,
I wear the mask,

13:56.137 --> 13:57.896
because when I was 22,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.172
a child molester pushed my face
into a campfire.

14:01.275 --> 14:04.413
Nothing the doctors did could
ever make my face a face again.

14:06.310 --> 14:07.896
Is that you wanted to hear?

14:09.689 --> 14:10.758
- Wow.

14:10.862 --> 14:13.620
- Jake,
I think you should leave.

14:13.724 --> 14:14.827
- Fine.

14:14.931 --> 14:16.482
Come on, Grace,
we're not wanted here.

14:16.586 --> 14:17.931
- Right behind you, Jake.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.241
- You are so brave.

14:21.344 --> 14:23.620
- I know, right?

14:26.689 --> 14:27.896
- Your feedback on this beer
is essential,

14:28.000 --> 14:29.793
so please don't hold back.

14:29.896 --> 14:32.172
On a scale of five to gross,

14:32.275 --> 14:35.862
how would you rank
the darker beer?

14:35.965 --> 14:38.620
- Oh, gross.
Who would make that?

14:38.724 --> 14:39.896
- I like this one.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.655
The other one tastes
like a fucking tree.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.620
- These people are philistines.

14:44.724 --> 14:46.482
They all like
the mass-produced garbage swill

14:46.586 --> 14:48.620
better than
the hand-crafted master brew

14:48.724 --> 14:50.137
I fermented in my fucking soul.

14:50.241 --> 14:52.206
- Totally, but quick question,

14:52.310 --> 14:54.551
can you make your beer taste
more like the garbage swill

14:54.655 --> 14:56.896
everyone likes better?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.896
We have to test this
on brewmasters.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.137
They'll agree with me.

15:00.241 --> 15:02.827
- Matty,
you gotta remember, man.

15:02.931 --> 15:06.034
You're not buying your beer.
These stupid cucks are.

15:06.137 --> 15:08.586
So even though they're dumb,
they're right.

15:08.689 --> 15:10.862
Real art is giving people
what they want.

15:10.965 --> 15:13.965
Truth is,
I focus test all my art.

15:14.068 --> 15:16.172
- But isn't that selling out?

15:16.275 --> 15:19.448
- Think about that phrase.
"Selling out."

15:19.551 --> 15:22.103
Would you rather go to a concert
that sells out,

15:22.206 --> 15:24.103
or one that no one wants to see?
- Hm.

15:24.206 --> 15:25.931
- A great album sells out.

15:26.034 --> 15:28.689
A great movie sells out.

15:28.793 --> 15:33.275
A great artist sells out.

15:33.379 --> 15:37.103
- But I thought my beer
was good the way I am.

15:37.206 --> 15:39.586
- Matt, there's a lot of money
at stake here.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.482
All you have to do
is make your beer taste worse

15:42.586 --> 15:43.827
so more people like it.

15:43.931 --> 15:48.482
- Do you wanna be a man?
Or do you wanna be a brand?

15:56.862 --> 15:58.931
- Oh, my God, so yesterday,
I forgot to tell you.

15:59.034 --> 16:00.586
TradeMarq comes into the office,

16:00.689 --> 16:03.103
and he's wearing
so much cologne, like too much.

16:03.206 --> 16:05.827
So imagine smelling that
while I tell you this story.

16:05.931 --> 16:08.000
- Hey.
I thought I'd find you here.

16:08.103 --> 16:09.448
- Oh, thank God.

16:09.551 --> 16:12.310
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
real quick...and not come back.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.034
- How's your beer?

16:15.137 --> 16:17.448
Oh, I--I'm sorry.
How's your brew?

16:17.551 --> 16:19.413
TradeMarq wants me to change it

16:19.517 --> 16:21.034
so that dumb people like it

16:21.137 --> 16:23.000
and everyone makes
a ton of money.

16:23.103 --> 16:24.310
I don't know what to do.

16:26.931 --> 16:29.344
There's something
I have to show you.

16:30.379 --> 16:31.586
- Wait, we just got here.

16:31.689 --> 16:32.827
You're just gonna leave
without paying?

16:32.931 --> 16:33.965
Is that what's happening?

16:34.068 --> 16:35.103
There's something
I've been hiding from you,

16:35.206 --> 16:37.517
but it's time you knew.

16:37.620 --> 16:38.655
Take a look.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.931
- What is this?
- It's my tag.

16:43.034 --> 16:44.379
I used to be
a major street artist,

16:44.482 --> 16:46.551
back when street art
still meant something.

16:46.655 --> 16:48.896
- You're Entrop?
- It's Entro-P.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.758
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

16:50.862 --> 16:52.620
That part of my life is over.

16:52.724 --> 16:54.413
You spend years
fighting corporations,

16:54.517 --> 16:56.413
and then finally you have to
admit to yourself,

16:56.517 --> 16:58.689
you love Southwestern egg rolls.

16:58.793 --> 16:59.931
- Wow.

17:00.034 --> 17:01.931
I'm sorry I said
you weren't an artist.

17:02.034 --> 17:04.862
This is technically art,

17:04.965 --> 17:09.448
if you wanna use a really broad
definition of what art is.

17:09.551 --> 17:11.413
- Look, Matt,
I'm in favor of selling out

17:11.517 --> 17:13.827
and making as much money
as humanly possible,

17:13.931 --> 17:15.275
but if you're gonna sell out,

17:15.379 --> 17:17.448
you shouldn't do it
because TradeMarq told you to.

17:17.551 --> 17:20.068
You should do it
for your own reasons.

17:20.172 --> 17:21.620
Or for money and fame.

17:26.137 --> 17:28.241
- The news said there's three
times as many as last week.

17:28.344 --> 17:29.689
- We have to stop feeding them.

17:32.103 --> 17:34.620
- ♪ Yeah!

17:37.034 --> 17:39.172
♪ Yeah!

17:39.275 --> 17:40.896
- And that's what I visualize
when I meditate.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.413
- Huh.

17:42.517 --> 17:44.206
- Are you wearing
a bulletproof vest?

17:44.310 --> 17:45.724
- You want one?

17:45.827 --> 17:47.758
- I think we can agree our
partnership has been a success.

17:47.862 --> 17:50.517
Your product line is pulling in
millions nationwide,

17:50.620 --> 17:53.137
and we've completely distracted
people from super fracking.

17:53.241 --> 17:56.103
- Okay, what is super fracking?

17:56.206 --> 17:58.206
- Uh--uh, don't worry about it.

17:58.310 --> 18:01.379
Uh, but this protest,
it--it's growing out of control.

18:01.482 --> 18:02.551
We need to find
a way to contain it

18:02.655 --> 18:04.241
while sustaining profits.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.000
- I have an idea.

18:06.103 --> 18:08.793
It's daring and original,

18:08.896 --> 18:11.689
but if the focus group agrees,

18:11.793 --> 18:13.034
I think it'll work.

18:14.793 --> 18:17.206
- Kate, John,
I've been thinking all weekend

18:17.310 --> 18:18.931
about whether or not
to change Matt's Brew,

18:19.034 --> 18:20.689
and I've finally
come to an answer

18:20.793 --> 18:21.965
that's true to who I am.

18:22.068 --> 18:24.758
- Actually, we've moved past
the Matt's Brew concept.

18:24.862 --> 18:26.482
Uh, it turns out
the whole self-made man

18:26.586 --> 18:28.379
is not tracking well
with male millennials.

18:28.482 --> 18:32.275
- Well, but--
- This is our new beer.

18:32.379 --> 18:33.655
- It's an energy beer.

18:33.758 --> 18:35.379
- We have certain friends
at the FDA

18:35.482 --> 18:37.482
who are turning a blind eye
so we can rush it to market.

18:37.586 --> 18:39.448
- We're gonna market test it
at Protestfest.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.137
- What's Protestfest?

18:41.241 --> 18:43.379
- Oh...
- Oh.

18:43.482 --> 18:44.758
- Ooh!

18:44.862 --> 18:46.275
- P-P-P-Protestfest.

18:46.379 --> 18:49.551
- The protest is now
a pro-fest in Protestfest,

18:49.655 --> 18:52.586
a four-day music festival
celebrating protesting.

18:52.689 --> 18:55.827
Headliners include Kanye West,
Rage Against the Machine,

18:55.931 --> 18:57.482
and LCD Soundsystem,

18:57.586 --> 18:59.344
playing their final show
on Friday

18:59.448 --> 19:02.034
and their reunion show
on Saturday.

19:02.137 --> 19:05.000
- Oh, my God.
This was my idea.

19:07.379 --> 19:08.827
- Oh, my God, I love your scarf.

19:08.931 --> 19:10.034
- This is my nightmare.

19:10.137 --> 19:13.206
- Oh, what up, sellouts?
You here to oppress me?

19:13.310 --> 19:14.689
I'll take a TradeMarq Tango,
please.

19:14.793 --> 19:17.896
- That'll be $13.99.
- Awesome.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.655
- Matt, Matt's mean friend.
What's up, my dudes?

19:21.758 --> 19:24.310
It's me, TradeMarq.
I keep the mask off in public,

19:24.413 --> 19:26.517
so people don't ask me
for selfies.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.310
- I thought you were burnt.

19:28.413 --> 19:30.172
Where are your face burns?

19:30.275 --> 19:33.034
- I don't have face burns.
I focus grouped that backstory,

19:33.137 --> 19:35.551
and it killed it
in the 18-49 demo.

19:35.655 --> 19:38.586
Anyway, I gotta go DJ
the Devour Mac and Cheese rave.

19:38.689 --> 19:40.137
- I thought you were
a real artist,

19:40.241 --> 19:41.517
but now I know
you're just a sellout.

19:41.620 --> 19:43.034
I don't wanna be
anything like you,

19:43.137 --> 19:46.000
except for your fame, wealth,
power, and social status.

19:46.103 --> 19:47.344
- I actually agree with you.

19:47.448 --> 19:49.137
Thing is,
most people are so boring

19:49.241 --> 19:52.379
that if you just put on a mask
or do anything slightly weird,

19:52.482 --> 19:53.551
they think you're a genius.

19:53.655 --> 19:56.310
So that's what I did,
and now I'm rich,

19:56.413 --> 19:58.241
and I love it.

19:58.344 --> 20:01.103
I love it so much.
I sleep really well at night.

20:01.206 --> 20:03.068
I got 13 hours of sleep
last night.

20:03.172 --> 20:04.724
- I'm so jealous of you,
it's insane.

20:04.827 --> 20:06.586
Come on, Matt,
let's get out of here.

20:08.586 --> 20:10.068
- Oh, shit, I thought
we were going that way.

20:10.172 --> 20:11.413
Fuck you.

20:11.517 --> 20:13.241
- I have a lot of sex too.

20:13.344 --> 20:17.655
- ♪ And I don't give a damn
about a greenback a-dollar ♪
