00:22.756 --> 00:24.557
Cyberthreats...
Cyberthreats...

00:24.591 --> 00:27.093
have become one of the most
serious threats to our nation.

00:27.127 --> 00:30.096
The cyber challenges we're talking
about are not theoretical.

00:30.130 --> 00:32.198
Hackers can shut down
our electric grid...

00:32.232 --> 00:33.266
Telecommunications...

00:33.299 --> 00:34.467
Our money, our secrets.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.369
This is something real.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.238
We're already under attack.

00:38.271 --> 00:40.273
Sony Pictures...
Target comes to mind.

00:40.306 --> 00:42.208
Sooner or
later, the U.S. will take action.

00:42.242 --> 00:43.710
We will respond.

00:43.743 --> 00:47.447
The FBI hopes to
graduate hundreds of new cyber agents.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.115
We still have a hard time
finding the right people.

00:49.149 --> 00:52.685
The Bureau's having
trouble finding enough qualified personnel.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.156
The current threat outpaces
our existing authorities.

00:56.189 --> 00:57.557
Terrorists...
Foreign governments...

00:57.590 --> 00:58.658
Criminals...
Hacktivists...

00:58.691 --> 01:01.194
The massive distributed
denial of service attack.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.463
A new form of warfare.

01:03.496 --> 01:06.199
Cyber attacks are
only going to get worse.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.735
The cyber
threat is threat number one.

01:08.768 --> 01:11.337
And in local
news, a Hillsborough County man

01:11.371 --> 01:13.440
has been sentenced
to three years in prison

01:13.473 --> 01:16.576
for hacking into a multinational
agricultural company

01:16.609 --> 01:18.678
and posting online
the home addresses

01:18.711 --> 01:21.114
and social security numbers
of its board of directors.

01:47.740 --> 01:48.741
Seriously?

02:04.991 --> 02:08.561
Have you remained in the same
residence since our last meeting?

02:08.595 --> 02:10.697
Yes, sir, still
at my brother's.

02:12.866 --> 02:16.669
Have you maintained
gainful full-time employment?

02:16.703 --> 02:19.939
Yes, sir, I'm dutifully employed
in the land of minimum wage.

02:23.243 --> 02:24.744
In lieu of
paying restitution,

02:24.777 --> 02:26.880
you've opted to perform
community service.

02:26.913 --> 02:30.817
Have you complied with the court order
for the required number of hours?

02:30.850 --> 02:36.189
Yes, sir, nothing gives me more pleasure
than seeing those little rug rats smile.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.626
Have you knowingly
violated any law

02:39.659 --> 02:42.629
at the Municipal, County,
State or Federal level?

02:42.662 --> 02:45.832
I'm as honest as a politician
during election season.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.600
Answer the
question, yes or no.

02:48.735 --> 02:51.704
No, sir, I haven't
violated any laws...

02:53.473 --> 02:55.275
that I'm specifically aware of.

02:57.477 --> 03:00.914
Finally, have you operated any
devices connected to the Internet,

03:00.947 --> 03:04.651
including a computer,
phone, tablet or television?

03:05.818 --> 03:07.687
No, sir. I haven't.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.299
I'm telling you,
give me one chance,

03:19.332 --> 03:21.000
and I'd hack
those TERRA cells so fast,

03:21.034 --> 03:22.569
they'd think I was
in the next room.

03:22.602 --> 03:24.637
You think our government's
doing anything about it?

03:24.671 --> 03:27.340
No. They rely on outside
groups like Anonymous

03:27.373 --> 03:29.709
to do their dirty work.
To pass them information.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.986
And then, they lock up kids
who were just having fun,

03:40.019 --> 03:41.921
when it's those kids
they should be hiring.

03:44.924 --> 03:46.326
Doesn't that
make you mad?

03:49.662 --> 03:51.998
Fools give full vent
to their rage.

03:52.031 --> 03:55.335
The wise bring
calm in the end.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.503
For Christs' sake, Stan...
And once again, please,

03:58.471 --> 03:59.739
my name is David now.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.509
You know,
David,

04:03.543 --> 04:05.845
changing your name doesn't
mean you get to start over.

04:05.878 --> 04:08.548
This isn't Halo, you
can't just respawn.

04:08.581 --> 04:13.052
You know, I'm willing to accept my
faults and set a path to correct them.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.988
But like a talisman,
my name serves

04:15.021 --> 04:16.623
as the key
to the spiritual mindset

04:16.656 --> 04:17.923
that I'm trying
to achieve.

04:17.957 --> 04:21.394
Doesn't alcohol
do the same thing?

04:21.427 --> 04:23.329
You should come to Bible
study with me sometime.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.699
All the answers
are in here.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.936
Now, if you'll excuse me,
we have customers.

04:38.978 --> 04:43.549
State-sponsored cyberterrorism,
though, isn't that the FBI's worst nightmare?

04:43.583 --> 04:45.151
Yes, if
a rogue terrorist

04:45.184 --> 04:48.521
were to perpetrate a hack, it
would be the worst nightmare.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.071
Yes.

05:58.491 --> 05:59.592
You forget
something?

06:05.998 --> 06:08.468
I found this,
stuck between my seats.

06:09.902 --> 06:13.106
Wait right there,
I have something for ya.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.778
Hi there, Jack.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.180
Hello. Beautiful
weather we're having.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.916
Are you kiddin' me? It's
hotter than hell out here.

06:23.950 --> 06:26.953
Oh, you know us southern
ladies never sweat.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.224
You came early today.

06:31.257 --> 06:33.726
Efficiency's
my middle name.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.028
Early isn't efficient,
it's just early.

06:37.096 --> 06:38.164
You got
that letter for me?

06:38.765 --> 06:39.799
Right.

06:45.204 --> 06:46.639
You okay there, son?

06:48.207 --> 06:49.475
Mm-hmm.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.610
"Happy Birthday, Tommy.

07:24.644 --> 07:28.815
"We remember when you were just a little
boy and now you're ten." Blah, blah, blah.

07:28.848 --> 07:33.019
"Love you very much.
Love Grammy and Granddad."

07:33.052 --> 07:34.487
Thank you, Grammy.

07:34.754 --> 07:35.822
Mwah.

07:39.792 --> 07:43.196
Adam... from Barb.

07:44.964 --> 07:48.167
Whoa. Nice to meet you.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.735
Stay right there.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.176
How generous of you.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.181
"Dear Adam, I've never done
anything like this before.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.250
Really?

08:04.283 --> 08:06.986
"I'm a little embarrassed but you
make me feel so comfortable.

08:07.019 --> 08:09.255
"I can't tell you enough
how much your encouragement

08:09.288 --> 08:12.592
"has brought me
out of a very dark place.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.994
"I don't know what's more impressive,
that I'm wearing lingerie,

08:15.027 --> 08:18.064
"or that I figured out
the camera timer."

08:18.097 --> 08:19.298
Well done.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.140
What's up
with the getup?

08:29.141 --> 08:30.776
I thought
you were at work?

08:30.810 --> 08:32.111
Called in sick.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.084
"Dear, Michael.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.323
"Tomorrow will be six years
since you left us.

09:20.192 --> 09:24.964
"2,190 days since
they told me you were gone."

09:24.997 --> 09:30.069
That's 2,190 nights
dreaming the same beautiful dream

09:30.102 --> 09:31.871
of you next to me.

09:34.407 --> 09:38.010
And then the same horrible
nightmare where you float away...

09:39.445 --> 09:41.147
dissolving into darkness.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.653
Leaving only that moment
when the doorbell rang.

09:56.062 --> 09:57.763
I forgive the soldier.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.200
I'm still angry with God.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.107
Daisy looks
more like you every day.

10:10.009 --> 10:13.312
She has your cute stubbornness
and your intellect, too.

10:16.248 --> 10:18.884
But she struggles
connecting with others.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.088
I just don't know what to do.

10:26.993 --> 10:30.796
I sent her application to that
school for the gifted in Nashville.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.798
It's a long shot,

10:32.832 --> 10:35.868
and it's expensive.
Too expensive.

10:37.737 --> 10:40.072
But I think you'd at least
want me to try, wouldn't you?

10:43.843 --> 10:46.912
I miss our mornings together.

10:46.946 --> 10:50.783
The dawning of each new day
bringing endless possibilities.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.122
Days filled with love.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.993
Nights filled with laughter.

11:02.461 --> 11:04.930
A life full of dreams.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.735
But that song has been sung.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.206
The harmony's gone.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.947
Dad thinks
it's time to move on.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.817
That rhetoric is
a poor substitute for action.

11:26.385 --> 11:29.422
Doesn't he realize my Prince
Charming is never coming back?

11:54.146 --> 11:55.314
Be right there.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.257
Agent Ames.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.193
Sam. May I come in?

12:09.261 --> 12:10.663
Do I have a choice?

12:10.696 --> 12:13.799
You always have a choice. Some
choices are just better than others.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.975
So, what brings you to
this side of the tracks?

12:26.178 --> 12:28.347
Ever hear of
the spice trail?

12:28.380 --> 12:30.583
Oh, the Indo-European
trade route?

12:30.616 --> 12:33.185
Yeah, we learn about it in school...
That's funny, that's very funny,

12:33.219 --> 12:36.055
but I'm referring to
the online drug marketplace.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.257
Oh, that spice trail.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.593
Well, you really should
have been more clear.

12:40.626 --> 12:44.130
We infiltrated it a few years
back, and we were hacked.

12:44.163 --> 12:46.232
Over 1,000 bitcoin
was stolen.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.267
We've only just now
caught up with the trail.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.902
Great. Congratulations.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.071
However, we're at a dead end.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.873
The trail vanishes.

12:55.641 --> 12:58.010
You think that's funny?

12:58.043 --> 13:00.813
It's just, I don't recall you
reaching a dead end with...

13:02.948 --> 13:04.416
with me.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.553
I'm sure whoever you're after is
using an encrypted Tor server

13:07.586 --> 13:08.821
just like I did.

13:08.854 --> 13:12.391
Yet you were somehow magically
able to find my IP address.

13:13.893 --> 13:15.294
So, I'm just wondering,

13:15.327 --> 13:18.464
why you don't break the
law to find them as well?

13:18.497 --> 13:21.867
Sam, the thing is,
we know the IP address.

13:21.901 --> 13:25.037
It was routed through the
same data center you used.

13:25.070 --> 13:28.641
Well, thanks to you, I'm prohibited
from using the Internet.

13:28.674 --> 13:32.178
So, unfortunately, there's
no way I can help you.

13:32.211 --> 13:35.247
Actually,
we think you can.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.483
Nobody leaves a calling
card quite like you, Sam.

13:40.586 --> 13:44.290
That's over $10 million
worth of bitcoin, gone.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.326
Which would make you a very rich man.

13:49.428 --> 13:54.133
Look, I have no idea who stole your
coins or how, that wasn't my game.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.668
If you were willing
to break into Monsanto...

13:55.701 --> 13:56.669
Come on,
that was for the people

13:56.702 --> 14:00.072
subjected to their
genetically-modified crap.

14:00.105 --> 14:02.875
That is a far cry from stealing
assets, even in the real world.

14:05.377 --> 14:06.378
Sam.

14:10.249 --> 14:11.317
Do you have the coins?

14:12.585 --> 14:14.186
No. I don't have them.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.057
Thank you for your time.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.527
Should have visited me
in prison.

14:23.629 --> 14:26.165
I've missed our little...
conversations.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.102
There's always next time.

14:48.654 --> 14:52.224
If you were to die today, how sure are
you that you'll be going to heaven?

14:53.692 --> 14:55.194
Well,

14:55.227 --> 14:57.730
if God's willing to overlook that
drunken one-night stand from last week,

14:57.763 --> 15:00.432
I'd say I've got
a 50-50 chance.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.670
You've got
to be kidding me?

15:04.703 --> 15:06.138
What is it?

15:06.171 --> 15:07.740
Trying to cash out of
this stupid poker game

15:07.773 --> 15:10.276
but it's saying
all I get is 1.2 dollars,

15:10.309 --> 15:12.978
which is a bunch of crap,
I just took the pot.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.179
Well, let me
see that for a sec.

15:19.351 --> 15:22.054
Oh, no,
it's not 1.2 dollars,

15:22.087 --> 15:23.589
it's 1.2 bitcoin.

15:23.622 --> 15:26.025
Those sneaky bastards!

15:26.058 --> 15:27.159
I gave them
my credit card.

15:27.192 --> 15:29.995
No, it's still real money.
It's just...

15:30.029 --> 15:33.198
It's a digital currency
based on a perceived value

15:33.232 --> 15:36.068
created by a group of people who
engage in trade, just like the dollar.

15:37.803 --> 15:39.305
Why are you such a dork?

15:43.542 --> 15:44.610
So, how do I get my money?

15:46.378 --> 15:47.513
In dollars.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.049
It's easy, you just...

15:50.082 --> 15:54.053
You just cash out and then convert
the dollars on an exchange.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.154
I can do it for you.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.658
Stanley?

16:02.795 --> 16:03.996
Hi, Rachel.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.065
We need to talk.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.502
Is everything okay?
What's going on?

16:11.737 --> 16:13.305
You hacked
the spice trail?

16:15.441 --> 16:17.343
Jesus Christ, Stan.

16:17.376 --> 16:20.245
Please don't take the Lord's name in vain.
How could you?

16:20.279 --> 16:21.780
It was a few years ago.
A few years...

16:21.814 --> 16:22.915
That isn't what
we were into.

16:22.948 --> 16:25.551
It wasn't corporate. We
agreed to stay corporate.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.586
Why would you hack into
a drug marketplace?

16:29.388 --> 16:31.590
You went rogue on me.

16:31.623 --> 16:33.525
I've already been to prison
once, I'm not going back again.

16:33.559 --> 16:34.727
Why?

16:34.760 --> 16:36.195
'Cause they're
bad people.

16:36.228 --> 16:37.496
They sell drugs to kids.

16:37.529 --> 16:40.065
They sold drugs
to my sister.

16:40.099 --> 16:41.433
They killed her, Sam.

16:43.369 --> 16:45.704
I... I can't cover
for you this time.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.573
You don't
have to, dude.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.208
You didn't do
anything wrong.

16:49.241 --> 16:50.376
Tell that
to Agent Ames,

16:50.409 --> 16:51.677
he stopped by
this afternoon.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.312
What?

16:55.147 --> 16:56.348
So, where are
the bitcoins?

17:00.319 --> 17:01.320
I lost them.

17:02.654 --> 17:03.756
They're gone.

17:03.789 --> 17:05.691
Gone?

17:05.723 --> 17:07.425
Why is he talking
to you about this?

17:09.627 --> 17:12.263
Check your wallet.
Karate cat was angry.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.742
I'll...

17:23.776 --> 17:26.744
I'll go talk to him. No.
I'll take care of it.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.247
He can't
prove anything.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.878
After you, m'lady.
Watch your step.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.616
Oh, hey there,
little bro.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.318
Meet Nancy.

18:06.351 --> 18:07.653
Nancy,
this is dipshit.

18:12.357 --> 18:13.892
This is
your brother?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.127
Mmm.

18:18.230 --> 18:20.632
Why don't you come
party with us tonight?

18:21.533 --> 18:23.368
It'll be fun.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.442
Oh, baby, come on,
you know I'm just playing.

18:32.578 --> 18:33.579
Baby?

18:34.346 --> 18:35.647
Babe.

18:35.681 --> 18:36.915
Come on, you know
I love you.

18:40.486 --> 18:41.487
Babe?

18:42.254 --> 18:43.255
Baby?

18:44.289 --> 18:45.290
Come on, baby.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.608
Are you ready for a good
day at school today?

22:10.996 --> 22:12.764
Hi. I'm Sam.

22:12.798 --> 22:15.967
I like long walks on the beach
and candlelit dinners.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.036
Oh, yeah, I'm also
a convicted felon.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.604
Recently released from prison,

22:54.506 --> 22:56.842

Hi.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.981
Come on. Let's get you up.

24:46.251 --> 24:47.686
Come on, that's it.

24:47.719 --> 24:49.921

25:08.874 --> 25:10.609

25:17.682 --> 25:18.683
Thank you.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.092
That's it. Over here.

25:28.827 --> 25:30.262
Sit down.

25:30.295 --> 25:32.597
Oh, my goodness, your hand.

25:34.165 --> 25:35.166
Does it hurt?

25:36.968 --> 25:38.303
I hadn't even noticed.

25:39.838 --> 25:41.339
It was very brave of you.
Thank you.

25:46.077 --> 25:47.579
Are you okay?

25:51.316 --> 25:56.655
I'll tel you what,
here is my name and number.

25:56.688 --> 26:01.259
If you start to feel worse
or get a headache, or just

26:01.293 --> 26:02.827
wanna lawyer up
and need a witness...

26:04.062 --> 26:05.664
call me.

26:05.697 --> 26:07.732
Hi, Josie.
I'm Sam.

26:08.133 --> 26:09.601
Hi, Sam.

26:11.169 --> 26:12.237
You sure you're okay?

26:13.238 --> 26:14.606
Better now.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.041
Okay.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.437
Have you remained in the
residence since our last meeting?

26:45.470 --> 26:48.106
Yes, sir. Still living
with my deadbeat brother.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.877
Have you maintained
gainful full-time employment?

26:53.979 --> 26:57.882
Yep. I'm still
stuck in reverse.

26:57.916 --> 27:01.820
In lieu of paying restitution, you've
opted to perform community service,

27:01.853 --> 27:04.723
have you complied with the court order
for the required number of hours?

27:06.157 --> 27:07.959
Tell me, sir, is this it?

27:09.094 --> 27:11.329
Is this what rehabilitation
looks like?

27:12.330 --> 27:14.032
Something troubling you, son?

27:14.065 --> 27:15.400
Yeah.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.335
I need a better job,
for starters,

27:17.369 --> 27:19.771
and a new car would be nice.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.874
And how's that possible when the
system's rigged against people like me?

27:23.408 --> 27:24.676
People like you?

27:26.277 --> 27:28.346
I'm not a bad person.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.048
You're also not a victim.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.819
Look...

27:34.853 --> 27:37.756
I understand how hard it is
when you first get out,

27:37.789 --> 27:39.824
you got no job,
no prospects,

27:39.858 --> 27:41.192
and in your case,

27:41.226 --> 27:43.962
are unable to earn a living using
the unique skill set that you have.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.230
I do get it.

27:45.263 --> 27:49.100
That's just it. I can still
do coding and security work.

27:49.134 --> 27:50.969
I don't have to be
connected to the Internet.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.471
I mean, I can do all
my work on a dummy station

27:53.505 --> 27:55.473
and then send thumb drives.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.742
There has to be a job
that'll let me do that.

28:03.381 --> 28:04.482
I'll tell you what,

28:06.117 --> 28:07.385
I'll do some
digging for you.

28:08.253 --> 28:09.287
Really?

28:12.390 --> 28:16.761
In lieu of paying restitution, you've
opted to perform community service.

28:16.795 --> 28:20.298
Have you complied with the court order
for the required number of hours?

28:21.533 --> 28:22.934
Yes, sir.

30:04.936 --> 30:06.337
Sweetie, why
aren't you asleep?

30:07.939 --> 30:10.008
Mama...
Yes?

30:10.041 --> 30:12.110
Do you think
Daddy's in heaven?

30:18.516 --> 30:19.584
Well...

30:22.086 --> 30:23.087
Come here.

30:24.522 --> 30:25.890
What do you think?

30:26.991 --> 30:30.595
Well,
Albert Einstein said,

30:30.628 --> 30:33.998
"Energy can't be
created or destroyed,

30:34.032 --> 30:37.435
"it can only be changed
from one form to another."

30:39.470 --> 30:41.639
I think Daddy
is a star.

30:45.577 --> 30:46.878
Daddy is a star.

30:48.146 --> 30:49.280
He was our star.

30:53.117 --> 30:55.053
Would you please
sing me a song.

30:55.954 --> 30:57.055
Mm-hmm.

32:57.742 --> 33:01.245
High cholesterol. Doctor
said I need more exercise.

33:02.213 --> 33:03.214
You look thin enough.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.559

Thank you. You have

33:25.403 --> 33:26.537
You too.

34:35.206 --> 34:37.675
I interviewed for that
customer service position today.

34:38.443 --> 34:39.811
I think it went well.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.480
Hi, sir,
how can I help you?

34:42.513 --> 34:47.150
Yeah, I need bee honey and all you
have is wild flower honey, so...

34:47.185 --> 34:49.754
Well, sir, wild flower honey
just means that the bees use

34:49.786 --> 34:53.424
primarily wild flower blossoms
to make the honey. So...

34:55.726 --> 34:57.261
You think I'm stupid
or something?

34:59.831 --> 35:02.767
My wife sent me down here
to get bee honey,

35:02.800 --> 35:04.535
I need honey that's
made from bees.

35:05.536 --> 35:06.771
Not by wild flowers.

35:16.881 --> 35:19.684
And although the pay
raise would certainly help,

35:19.717 --> 35:22.854
I still don't think
it'll be enough for Daisy.

35:22.887 --> 35:25.456
Daisy...

35:25.490 --> 35:27.758
She got in trouble again
at school today.

35:29.227 --> 35:30.628
What am I doing wrong?

35:38.469 --> 35:40.438
The guys are playing
again this weekend.

35:41.339 --> 35:42.507
Should I go?

35:44.842 --> 35:46.577
I miss the music.

35:49.947 --> 35:51.716
But that was a different life.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.685
I was a different person.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.522
No.

35:57.555 --> 36:00.525
Honey, you need to eat. Grandpa went through
a lot of trouble making that for you.

36:00.558 --> 36:02.627
Smells like
Godzilla farted.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.961

36:03.995 --> 36:05.863
Where did you learn that?

36:05.897 --> 36:08.432
At school.
It's okay.

36:08.466 --> 36:09.867
No, Dad,
it's not okay.

36:10.735 --> 36:11.802
Apologize.

36:13.371 --> 36:15.373
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

36:15.406 --> 36:17.808
Apology accepted.

36:17.842 --> 36:21.279
Now we eat some chicken
nuggets and french fries?

36:21.312 --> 36:23.414
That'd be much better.
Thank you.

36:23.447 --> 36:24.715
You're quite welcome.

36:35.326 --> 36:36.827
Whatcha doing?

36:36.861 --> 36:40.464
I'm drawing a processional
graph of Mercury's orbit.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.804
Isn't it pretty?

36:46.837 --> 36:49.607

36:50.541 --> 36:52.777
It's beautiful.

36:52.810 --> 36:55.446
I want to start
a new chapter but,

36:55.947 --> 36:57.648
who am I?

36:57.682 --> 37:00.351
I've been caught between
the past and the future.

37:01.586 --> 37:02.687
Just waiting...

37:07.625 --> 37:09.527
Is this it for me?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.696
All the dreams I had,
are they...

37:13.864 --> 37:16.801
are they gone forever, too?

37:16.834 --> 37:20.771
Hey there, Josie.
Looking good!

37:20.805 --> 37:22.640
Hi, Tom,
how are you today?

37:24.108 --> 37:26.978
Mother's going out
for bingo tonight.

37:27.011 --> 37:28.846
She's going
to be out late.

37:28.879 --> 37:29.914
That's nice.

37:30.781 --> 37:31.782
Excuse me!

37:35.686 --> 37:38.389
Um... I have
a date tonight.

37:40.424 --> 37:41.559
Sorry, Tom.

37:48.699 --> 37:50.835
I think you just
saved me again.

37:50.868 --> 37:53.337
I guess it's providence that
we ran into each other then.

37:53.371 --> 37:54.472
Again.

37:56.140 --> 37:59.010
So, I never got a call form
you, I take it you're okay?

38:00.478 --> 38:03.414
Well, I am
a little concerned

38:03.447 --> 38:04.949
about this corn.

38:04.982 --> 38:06.817
Do you know
if it's non-GMO?

38:10.121 --> 38:13.424
Did you get it in the certified
organic produce section?

38:13.824 --> 38:15.359
Yes, I did.

38:16.394 --> 38:18.896
Then, yes,
it is non-GMO.

38:18.929 --> 38:22.767
Great. I feel so much
better now. Shall we?

38:23.501 --> 38:25.002
Shall we what?

38:25.036 --> 38:26.604
I believe you
mentioned a date?

38:27.705 --> 38:28.706
Well, that...

38:29.907 --> 38:31.776
No, I didn't actually
mean that you...

38:31.809 --> 38:34.745
you and I were gonna go on a...
on a date.

38:34.779 --> 38:37.048
Then, shall we
have a drink?

38:37.081 --> 38:39.016
Isn't that
the same thing?

38:39.050 --> 38:40.618
Depends on how
you look at it.

38:40.651 --> 38:41.952
Plus you do
kind of owe me.

38:42.853 --> 38:43.921
I do not.

38:46.090 --> 38:46.991
Tom?

38:47.024 --> 38:49.493
St...
Stop it. Tom?

38:51.462 --> 38:53.097
And I jumped in front
of a car for you.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.767
If that doesn't get a guy a
drink, I don't know what does.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.673

I haven't
done this in...

40:03.634 --> 40:04.668
ever.

40:06.103 --> 40:07.471
Neither have I.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.044
I always dreamed
of being a singer.

40:15.212 --> 40:17.214
But, I mean,
what kid didn't?

40:18.149 --> 40:19.917
Me.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.787
I respect music way too much
to subject this voice to it.

40:26.157 --> 40:27.491
So, what's
stopping you?

40:29.026 --> 40:30.795
Life, I suppose.

40:32.830 --> 40:33.964
I was even in a band.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.702
People really do that?

40:38.736 --> 40:40.805
I mean, I feel like
everybody wants to

40:40.838 --> 40:43.641
but I never met anybody
who actually has.

40:43.674 --> 40:47.011
Well, don't let this customer
service uniform fool you.

40:47.044 --> 40:48.112
We were good.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.649
You are brave.

40:52.249 --> 40:54.218
I was brave. I was.

40:56.086 --> 40:58.489
What about you? What did you
want to be when you grew up?

41:00.191 --> 41:01.492
A fighter pilot.

41:02.626 --> 41:03.928
That's impressive.

41:05.062 --> 41:06.864
So are you
a fighter pilot?

41:06.897 --> 41:10.067
Unfortunately, no.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.503
A little thing called
school got in the way.

41:12.870 --> 41:14.038
Grades?

41:14.071 --> 41:17.274
No, no, that wasn't the
problem, I got straight A's.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.010
I had what
you might call...

41:21.111 --> 41:22.546
behavioral problems.

41:23.781 --> 41:26.116
Looking back,
I think I was just bored.

41:28.118 --> 41:29.587
I acted out a lot.

41:30.187 --> 41:32.623
Do you still act out?

41:34.358 --> 41:38.162
Honesty, I just try to focus
on the little victories.

41:38.195 --> 41:39.797
It's what gets me
through the day.

41:40.898 --> 41:43.000
Hmm.

41:43.033 --> 41:45.236
Maybe some day, they'll
add up to something.

41:46.036 --> 41:47.137
Something special.

41:49.373 --> 41:50.841
Let's drink to that.

41:59.216 --> 42:01.952
Hello, Mrs. Cartwright,
this is Hawthorne Elementary calling.

42:01.986 --> 42:05.289
Please give us a call back. It's regarding
your daughter, Daisy. Thank you.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.004
Come in.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.775
Please, sit down,
Mrs. Cartwright.

42:26.076 --> 42:27.611
What happened?

42:27.645 --> 42:29.113
Daisy hit a girl.

42:29.146 --> 42:32.983
She's okay. Just a little
shaken up, they both are.

42:33.017 --> 42:36.120
Daisy gets frustrated easily
which I'm sure you know.

42:36.153 --> 42:37.888
But the thing is,
it's getting worse.

42:37.922 --> 42:40.024
She's becoming
more anti-social.

42:40.057 --> 42:41.492
She just retreats
into herself.

42:41.525 --> 42:44.261
She doesn't pay attention, she doesn't
interact with the other kids,

42:44.295 --> 42:46.263
she just doodles
all day long.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.268
I would like you
to consider this.

42:56.707 --> 42:59.810
Special education?
You're not serious?

42:59.843 --> 43:02.713
We just feel that she would
do better in another program.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.782
One that can cater
to her unique needs.

43:04.815 --> 43:07.851
But she's smart.
She's really smart.

43:07.885 --> 43:11.255
We're doing the best we can, Mrs.
Cartwright.

43:11.288 --> 43:13.724
But we can't have her
hitting other kids.

43:13.757 --> 43:15.960
That's two weeks
in a row.

43:15.993 --> 43:19.096
I have to take the well-being
of all students into account,

43:19.129 --> 43:20.864
including that
of Daisy's.

43:39.717 --> 43:40.784
Hey.

43:43.754 --> 43:45.022

45:43.607 --> 45:46.110
Well, I haven't.
But she has.

45:46.143 --> 45:49.012

this is gonna end?

46:01.024 --> 46:03.193
Really?
I've gotta try.

46:03.227 --> 46:04.595
Try to be
something better.

46:04.628 --> 46:07.397
If I don't, I'll just be living
the same life I've always lived.

Is there a problem?

46:41.165 --> 46:43.167
Has he reported
on his weekly probation?

46:43.634 --> 46:44.835
He has.

46:46.036 --> 46:47.971
Hasn't missed even once?

46:48.005 --> 46:51.041
No, he's been
a model probationer, why?

46:51.074 --> 46:53.477
Hasn't asked you
to look the other way?

Ames. Right.

46:59.349 --> 47:01.018
Of course, forgive me.

Uh...

47:02.586 --> 47:04.488
One more question
before I leave.

47:04.521 --> 47:07.858
Has he mentioned anything to you
at all about stolen bitcoins?

47:08.358 --> 47:09.359
No.

Wow, I haven't been to

48:49.526 --> 48:52.029

They serve the best corned

Or, we could go in here,

49:18.221 --> 49:21.425
have a meal, laugh,
listen to great music.

51:36.393 --> 51:40.397
He was my idol in a way that
parents can't be at that age.

51:40.430 --> 51:43.834
And I was walking down the
street with my mom, and...

51:43.867 --> 51:45.802
he was on the other
side, approaching us.

52:03.620 --> 52:04.654
Wow.

52:10.227 --> 52:11.495
He had remarried.

52:11.528 --> 52:12.562
His first wife had died

52:12.596 --> 52:16.933
and the new wife thought
it would be a good idea to

52:18.001 --> 52:19.769
disassociate him
from his kids.

52:22.772 --> 52:25.942
That was the last I ever
talked to my grandfather.

52:29.779 --> 52:31.515
A few weeks later,

52:31.548 --> 52:33.850
we packed up and left town
in the middle of the night.

52:35.886 --> 52:38.288
I started to stutter.

52:38.321 --> 52:40.357
I kept asking
my parents if...

52:42.559 --> 52:43.560
if I was good.

52:45.362 --> 52:47.197
I was paranoid, really.

52:51.968 --> 52:53.870
And then I grew up
and realized,

52:53.904 --> 52:56.273
it doesn't really matter
if you're good or not.

52:58.041 --> 53:01.645
My being good had nothing
to do with his choice.

53:07.751 --> 53:08.785

I don't get out much.

53:21.298 --> 53:24.601
Six years ago,
in Afghanistan.

53:25.468 --> 53:26.803

53:48.592 --> 53:50.760
The sad part is,
is that...

53:50.794 --> 53:52.562
he never even got
to meet his daughter.

53:58.101 --> 54:00.403
What kind of man was he?

54:07.444 --> 54:08.678
He was honest.

54:10.580 --> 54:12.515
He always saw the positive
in everything.

54:14.484 --> 54:15.885
He was a romantic.

54:17.821 --> 54:18.989
He was kind.

54:21.791 --> 54:23.059
He loved me.

54:25.528 --> 54:26.696
And I loved him.

54:30.600 --> 54:31.668
We were
high school sweethearts,

54:31.701 --> 54:32.736
I mean...

54:34.104 --> 54:35.572
he's all I've ever known.

54:38.642 --> 54:39.976
And when his life ended,

54:42.379 --> 54:43.446
so did mine.

54:48.618 --> 54:49.686
Now I live for Daisy.

54:54.824 --> 54:56.426

I think he's
talking about you.

55:26.122 --> 55:28.391
Josie, come on up here.
Let's have some fun.

55:28.425 --> 55:30.960
Um, I'm good. No.

55:30.994 --> 55:32.696
Go on,
I'll be right here.

55:37.934 --> 55:38.968
You can do this.

55:47.744 --> 55:49.612
There she is, folks,
give her a big hand.

56:07.097 --> 56:08.164
♪ Baby

56:09.632 --> 56:12.435
♪ Tell me what you're thinking

56:14.771 --> 56:16.439

56:17.540 --> 56:19.609

57:04.654 --> 57:07.257
Thank you for tonight.

57:07.290 --> 57:08.992
I had forgotten what it
feels like to have fun.

57:13.897 --> 57:15.031
Look, Josie,

57:15.064 --> 57:17.233
I really like you and I
wanna be completely hon...

57:17.267 --> 57:18.568
Shh.

57:33.683 --> 57:35.652
Yeah, that was
pretty smooth.

57:40.089 --> 57:41.157
Good night.

57:42.692 --> 57:43.793
Good night.

58:06.249 --> 58:07.116
Fill this out.

58:07.150 --> 58:09.285
And I also need to see
two forms of ID.

58:09.319 --> 58:11.087
Hey, I'm from
the Zoldi Corporation.

58:11.120 --> 58:12.989
We look after
your network infrastructure.

58:13.022 --> 58:14.057
Excuse me.

58:14.090 --> 58:15.592
We recently
updated the BIOS

58:15.625 --> 58:18.194
on your system drives
and as reported,

58:18.228 --> 58:20.930
the Wi-Fi is assigning
dynamic IP addresses

58:20.964 --> 58:22.999
to the ones that
should be static.

58:23.032 --> 58:25.335
So, I need to get
in the server room.

58:25.368 --> 58:28.605
It's an emergency, so if you
could just push that button.

58:28.638 --> 58:30.039
Thank you.

58:35.345 --> 58:36.746
Oh, I'm sorry.

58:58.768 --> 58:59.936
Unbelievable.

59:28.998 --> 59:30.333
How may I help you?

59:30.366 --> 59:33.336
I was brought in to do an integrity
check on the Wi-Fi network,

59:33.369 --> 59:36.706
and I came across a DDoS attack
on the way on your mainframe.

59:37.840 --> 59:39.842
"Distributed denial
of service."

59:40.977 --> 59:42.245
It's kind of
a big problem.

59:43.379 --> 59:45.782
Okay. What would
you like me to do?

59:46.883 --> 59:49.218
I would like you
to get me in there.

59:49.252 --> 59:50.253
They're in meetings.

59:52.121 --> 59:53.323
Look,

59:53.356 --> 59:55.158
I'm sure you've done
everything right

59:55.191 --> 59:57.060
to get behind
this big desk.

59:57.093 --> 59:58.328
Went to
the right school,

59:58.361 --> 01:00:00.830
flashed that saccharin
smile of yours,

01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:03.199
and used it at just the right
moment to kiss the boss' ass,

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:04.767
but if you don't
get me in there,

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:06.669
all anybody
will remember

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:09.138
is that you're the guy who
failed to protect this company.

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:13.943
You're responsible for all its
clients' money being stolen.

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:16.145
Now, is that what you
worked so hard for?

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.215
No. No, it's not.

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:21.684
So, I want you
to use those...

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:23.286
perfectly-manicured
hands of yours

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:25.855
to pick up that phone and
get me in there. Right now.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:32.428
Yes, there's a gentleman out
here with our network provider,

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:36.699
who says we're under
a distributed denial...

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:39.035
...of service attack.
...of service attack?

01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:40.203
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:42.305
Yes, okay.

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.675
She said to go on in.

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:47.844
What do you know?

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:57.453
What's going on?

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.188
I'm here
for my interview.

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:01.357
Excuse me? The network
security interview.

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:03.259
May I?

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.030
You've been hacked,
by the way.

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:16.773
I don't understand.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.376
It's what's called
social engineering.

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:22.845
I simply impersonated
a field technician,

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:27.216
said I was checking Wi-Fi integrity
and security parted like the Red Sea.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:32.088
I could have loaded any kind of malware
or spyware on your company's mainframe.

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:35.792
I could have downloaded every
document or email in this firm.

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.827
But, of course, I didn't.

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:42.965
Sam Collins?

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:44.867
Yes, sir.

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:49.906
I understand the condition
of your probation

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:52.208
is you're not allowed
access to the Internet.

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:56.179
Maybe I should have
hacked in after all.

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:57.947
Changed the records.

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:06.989
Forgive me,
but, isn't access

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:09.092
to the Internet
kind of needed

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:11.060
to secure our company
from attacks

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:14.130
coming... from...
the Internet?

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:15.298
Well,

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:18.901
As I said, my hack today
was simple social engineering.

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:20.536
Which is exactly what
some teenager did

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.271
when he hacked the head
of the CIA, by the way.

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:25.441
Where the Internet
is concerned,

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:29.479
I can write software simulating
any kind of attack imaginable.

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:33.449
Then I can create a virtual
environment to test these attacks,

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:35.818
and then provide the code
for somebody else to implement.

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.489
Mr. Collins,

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:41.424
although we appreciate
your enthusiasm...

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:44.527
Corporations spend
$60 billion worldwide

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.929
on information security
services last year.

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:50.066
They're expected to shell out
another 86 billion this year.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.035
The reality is,

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:57.073
you control a lot of money,
but you're vulnerable.

01:02:57.106 --> 01:03:02.011
Entrepreneurial hackers hunt for security
flaws in companies just like yours.

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:05.515
Then they sell that info to governments
from Russia to North Korea,

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:07.183
as well as your competitors.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:13.089
For that single vulnerability,

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:16.125
I could have
been paid $150,000.

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:19.028
You're welcome.

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:30.940
Look, hire a middle-aged man with a computer
degree from your local community college,

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:33.476
if that's what you think
will protect you.

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:35.278
But don't say
you haven't been warned.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.990
Thank you, Mr. Collins
for your...

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:50.259
insightful commentary.

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:56.532
We'll be in touch.

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:25.494
How'd
the interview go?

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:26.562
What are
you doing here?

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:35.171
Sure, help yourself.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.041
What are we gonna do
with you, Sam?

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:42.578
You've got
nothing on me.

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:45.081
You know, impersonating a postal
worker is a federal crime?

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:49.018
I'm sure that your
probation officer would be

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:51.654
none too pleased upon
receiving this information.

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:53.656
Neither would the judge.
Okay, I get it.

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:55.625
Okay, so back to
my original question.

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.494
What are we gonna
do with you?

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:01.530
Pretend like
it never happened.

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:04.300
No, that's...

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.068
That's not what
I had in mind.

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.573
Get me
the bitcoins, Sam.

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:12.441
Then this little problem
of yours will go away.

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:15.645
I told you,
I don't have them.

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:17.179
I... I never did.

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.016
You got three days.

01:05:46.676 --> 01:05:48.311
Stanley, we need to talk.

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:52.381
Come on, Stan,
I know you're in there.

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:58.287
David, please open up.

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:05.594
We need to find
those bitcoins, now.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:09.265
Agent Ames just busted me
for stealing mail.

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:11.100
What?

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:12.735
Why are you
stealing mail?

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:14.537
Well, first for money,
but then for...

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:16.605
love.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:21.277
Oh, so the bad boys really do
get all the girls, don't they?

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.713
No, they don't.

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:26.282
The girls that matter,
they just want an honest man.

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:34.290
Okay, the uh...

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:37.193
Okay.

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:38.794
The bitcoins
disappeared

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:41.497
when I ran them
through the tumbler.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.232
He's never gonna find them.

01:06:43.265 --> 01:06:44.600
I'm sorry, Sam.

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:46.802
I can't believe
you tried to launder them.

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:57.546
What are
you gonna do?

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.784
I don't know, David.

01:07:01.817 --> 01:07:03.786
I'm thinking of giving
prayer a try.

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:13.229
Kung fu?

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:14.830
Really?

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.699
Yeah. It's cool.

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:39.255
Are you messing
with me, Sam?

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:43.125
No, sir.

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:45.227
Then why did you hack
into that job interview?

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.464
I was trying
to take initiative.

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:51.534
I thought
I could help them.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:54.336
They weren't asking you
for that kind of help.

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:56.472
Their ignorance isn't
something I could ignore.

01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:58.774
Their ignorance?

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:00.342
I was doing
that company a favor.

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:03.779
No! You were gambling
with my relationships.

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.514
The world is burning
around us,

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:07.650
and we're playing by
a different set of rules.

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:10.386
You smoke one joint,
you're not FBI material.

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:13.355
You show initiative, you're told
not to think outside the box.

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:15.491
You hack into a company
to try to help people,

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:18.894
you're relegated to working
in an ice-cream cone.

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.863
It's not how you win a war.
Not this one.

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.499
A war?

01:08:23.532 --> 01:08:24.800
Okay, enlighten me, son.

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:27.236
How does one
win this war?

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:30.473
You put your best soldiers on the front
lines and let them battle it out.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:31.474
Just like
we've always done.

01:08:31.506 --> 01:08:33.576
Is that how you see
yourself, a soldier?

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:34.743
I could be.

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:37.246
Young man,

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:39.415
to be a soldier,

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:42.885
you have to think of someone
other than yourself.

01:08:42.917 --> 01:08:44.420
Because when
you're a soldier,

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.423
if you make a mistake,
people could die.

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:51.227
Right now,

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.795
what I see hiding behind

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:54.763
that charming smile
of yours,

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:58.434
is someone who is out for
himself, damn the rest of us.

01:09:00.301 --> 01:09:02.671
Is that the type
of soldier you wanna be?

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:09.712
Agent Ames,

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:12.481
came by
my office yesterday.

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:17.185
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:20.622
About stolen bitcoins?

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:23.392
I didn't steal
his bitcoins.

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:25.928
Not that it matters,

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:27.662
he circumvented
the law before

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:29.430
to put me in prison,
he'll do it again.

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:40.509
Okay.

01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:06.602
Hmm.

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:18.647
Whoa.

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:37.533
Okay, let's make this cool.

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:39.268
All right. Hi-yah!

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:35.658
Huh?

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:35.951
Hello, Barb.

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:37.152
Stay right there.

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:48.056
Hey, Adam.

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:52.027
Sorry, do I know you?

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.897
You think it's funny, what
you're doing to that lady?

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:58.200
What's it to you?

01:13:58.233 --> 01:14:01.003
She's somebody's mother.
Somebody's daughter.

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:03.839
What if it was your mom?

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:08.010
Gimme the money.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.484
Sorry.
Tell that to her.

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:20.789
Get in the car.

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:29.231
I sent you packing
for a reason, honey.

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:32.901
What the hell! This shit
better be important.

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.103
FBI.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.540
I swear, she told me she was 18.

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:40.209
Where's Sam?

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:42.911
Oh, um, have you
checked his work?

01:14:45.647 --> 01:14:47.716
What I was just saying
before, I was just kiddin'.

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:51.954
Hmm.

01:15:19.948 --> 01:15:21.016
Hmm.

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:35.130
Excuse me.
Outta my way.

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:37.099
Where's Sam?

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:40.836
I'm sorry.
I don't speak rude.

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:44.339
Don't mess with me,
sprinkle lady.

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:48.076
I don't know,
he's not on the schedule.

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:49.878
You wanna look?

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:11.967
I was wondering when
you'd show back up.

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:16.738
Come here.

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:19.074
I got somethin'
for ya.

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:53.208
Well... aren't you
gonna open it?

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.146
How long have you known?

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.922
I had a barber
in Vietnam.

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:09.157
His name was Frank.

01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:12.661
That wasn't
his real name.

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:17.332
He had a wife, kids,
from the village,

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:20.702
just outside of Saigon
where I was stationed.

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:22.337
Long Binh.

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:26.441
Frank was a jolly guy,

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:28.043
always smilin'.

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:31.446
Just like you.

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:37.085
Then one day while
he was giving me a shave,

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:38.754
the razor stopped.

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:41.990
I looked up at Frank,

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:44.926
and he had this look
on his face...

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.864
A mixture
of hate and fear.

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:53.935
Normally you just see one or the
other when they're fightin'.

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:57.372
But this was close up.

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.375
It made it more real.

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:05.313
Turns out Frank
was Viet Cong.

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:09.918
Turns out a lot
of our friends were.

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:15.323
So,

01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:17.926
tell me,

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:21.430
what is it
you want, Sam?

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:26.935
I just wanna be
the kinda man

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:28.837
that she could someday
write a letter to.

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:35.143
Nothing's stopping you from being
that kinda man but yourself.

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:02.304
You'll find her at work.

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:20.088
I'm assuming you've
received my e-mail?

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:24.993
Our adversary, the Devil, prowls like a
roaring lion seeking to devour its prey.

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:40.976
FBI.

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:44.446
That so?

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:46.982
Yeah, that is so.

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:50.051
We're investigating reports of
missing mail in the neighborhood.

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:51.453
Have you noticed anything
out of the ordinary?

01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:54.256
Can't say I have.

01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:58.293
If you and your daughter
are involved in any of this,

01:19:58.326 --> 01:19:59.961
that makes you accessories
after the fact.

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:01.997
Again,

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:04.266
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:06.368
Well, if you
think of anything.

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:49.177
Cheese is in
the dairy section, last aisle.

01:20:49.211 --> 01:20:50.545
Have a good day.
Thanks.

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:52.147
Bye.

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.088
Are you here
for some more corn?

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:01.990
No.

01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:04.492
I'm here for you.

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:09.931
I want you to know that I
haven't been honest with you.

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:13.568
Not about some
things at least.

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:19.307
Things I hope don't change how
you feel about me because I'm...

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:21.643
I'm...

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:25.247
I'm still the same person.
Collins.

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:28.683
You're under arrest for
impersonating a U.S. postal worker.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:30.352
Josie...
Sam, what's going on?

01:21:30.385 --> 01:21:32.254
Let's go.
I'm sorry, I...

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:33.455
You're not sorry.
You're done.

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:36.524
That was your answer?

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:38.226
Stealing more
of my bitcoins?

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:40.462
Huh?

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:06.221
Stay right there.

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:07.689
Stand down,
I'm arresting this man.

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:09.624
No, you're not.

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:11.459
I said, stand down, I'm
arresting this man. No, no, no.

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:12.527
Drop your weapon!

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:16.264
I said,
drop your weapon.

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:19.434
Drop your weapon.

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:22.604
Drop it now!

01:22:23.805 --> 01:22:25.740
We know about
the bitcoins.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:29.411
It's all over, Ames.
Last chance.

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:33.048
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Drop your weapon now.

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:43.024
You're making
a big mistake.

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:44.626
Mark Ames,
you're under arrest

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:46.428
for wire fraud
and money laundering.

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:47.796
Do you know
who I am?

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:51.466
Each count carries a maximum
sentence of 20 years.

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:53.568
I assume you're aware
you're going to jail.

01:22:54.602 --> 01:22:56.004
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:59.274
Anything you say can and will be
held against you in a court of law.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.276
You okay,
kid?

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:03.211
Yeah.
Thank you.

01:24:00.769 --> 01:24:03.071
Go ahead. Open it.

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:20.522
The Tomb of
the Unknown Solider

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:23.224
doesn't actually
receive letters.

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:26.127
But, I never had
the heart to tell you.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.643
It seemed you needed
something to hold on to.

01:24:43.478 --> 01:24:48.149
Something that could
get you from moment to moment.

01:24:51.786 --> 01:24:54.622
So, when the first letter
was returned,

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:59.294
I set up a post office box
and forwarded them there.

01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:02.764
This box is just one of many.

01:25:07.335 --> 01:25:11.840
There's two letters
missing from that box.

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:16.611
You think there's a chance they may have
reached their intended destination after all?

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.415
How could you say that?

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:25.787
Michael is dead.

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:31.726
He died six years ago.

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:39.200
Daisy needs a mother.

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:42.937
A mother willing to chase her dreams,
otherwise what are you showing her?

01:25:44.506 --> 01:25:47.375
How to survive?
Survival isn't enough.

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:51.846
Not when she has
an opportunity to thrive.

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:01.289
You can honor him by living.

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:03.892
Not by writing letters.

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:27.882
Have you remained in the same
residence since our last meeting?

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:30.919
Yes, sir.

01:26:32.954 --> 01:26:35.823
Have you maintained
gainful full-time employment?

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:44.699
Have you, uh...

01:26:46.568 --> 01:26:48.736
You handled yourself well
during this whole mess.

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:52.607
I could have
done better.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.011
Well, life is more about where
you end up, not where you begin.

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:58.313
Don't you think?

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:01.950
Yes, sir.

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:07.922
I'm gonna...

01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:11.025
recommend early termination
of your probation.

01:27:11.793 --> 01:27:13.194
What?

01:27:13.227 --> 01:27:16.931
I mean, it'll be up to the judge
to make the final decision, but...

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:19.434
I'm confident
he'll judge favorably.

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:24.339
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

01:27:28.643 --> 01:27:31.980
I don't have to tell you to make
the most of this second chance.

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:35.583
No, sir.
You have my word.

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:52.467
I'm so glad to see you.

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:56.638
How are you?

01:27:57.972 --> 01:27:59.073
I'm doing well.

01:28:00.742 --> 01:28:02.343
Why are you
doing this, David?

01:28:02.377 --> 01:28:04.712
Please,
call me Stanley.

01:28:04.746 --> 01:28:06.814
Oh, thank God.

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:10.585
I knew if Agent Ames stole
bitcoins once, he'd do it again.

01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:12.387
So, I hacked
into his accounts

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:14.389
and traced
all his deposits.

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:16.391
But, in order to send
everybody that email,

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:18.593
I had to hack into
the Department of Justice.

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:20.962
Apparently they don't look too
favorably on that sorta thing.

01:28:20.995 --> 01:28:21.996
So...

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:31.406
I also told them that it
was me who stole the mail.

01:28:32.073 --> 01:28:33.875
What? Why would you do that?

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:38.646
"Greater love hath
no man than this,

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.882
"that a man lay down
his life for his friends."

01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:43.551
It's exactly what
you did for me,

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:45.119
when you took
the fall for us.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:47.455
This is my opportunity
to pay you back.

01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:49.590
I have to tell them.
Don't you dare.

01:28:50.925 --> 01:28:52.493
It'll mess up
my plea bargain.

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:57.799
So,

01:28:58.966 --> 01:28:59.967
how's your girl?

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:02.537
Doubtful I'll ever know.

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:05.006
Haven't you asked her?

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:08.443
Sam, you have
to ask her.

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:11.012
Otherwise, what has this
whole thing been for?

01:29:11.045 --> 01:29:13.081
Remember, you've
got to try.

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:17.118
Speaking of...

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:22.390
She's a weird girl,
that Rachel.

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:25.727
Said she always wanted
a pen pal in prison.

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:33.401
What can I do for you?

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:36.537
Talk to Josie.

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:44.412
Sam.

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:49.550
There's something
I want you to have.

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:51.586
Yeah?

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:53.821
My Bible.

01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:57.425
I'd be honored.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.662
John, Chapter 4
is my favorite.

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:36.564
Let's see what the big deal
is, Stan, shall we.

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:59.587
John, Chapter 4.

01:31:12.934 --> 01:31:14.168
John, Chapter 4.

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:22.977
A bitcoin wallet address?

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:27.648
Stanley, you sly
son of a gun.

01:32:10.858 --> 01:32:12.093
Well, what do you know.

01:32:13.227 --> 01:32:15.329
You really do have
all the answers.

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:19.066
♪ I could never see

01:32:21.836 --> 01:32:23.170

01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:41.622
♪ Till I loved you

01:32:43.257 --> 01:32:45.226
I came to apologize.

01:32:45.259 --> 01:32:47.028
You stole my letters.

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:48.729
Yes, I did.

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:50.631
What gives you the right?

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:52.199
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:00.708
I don't even know
who you are.

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:04.845
I'm a computer hacker.

01:33:07.281 --> 01:33:10.117
A convicted felon
who was recently granted

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:12.320
early release
from probation.

01:33:15.756 --> 01:33:18.726
I work in a giant ice cream
cone on the other side of town.

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:21.796
And I stole your mail,

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:25.266
hoping I could earn
a couple extra bucks.

01:33:28.002 --> 01:33:30.071
But that was before
I read your letters.

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.407
Before I fell
in love with you.

01:33:35.843 --> 01:33:38.112
From that moment,
I resolved to change.

01:33:39.046 --> 01:33:40.414
To become
a better man.

01:33:45.019 --> 01:33:46.253
You're a thief.

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:50.691
I only hacked into
the bad people.

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:55.463
You hacked into me, Sam.

01:33:55.496 --> 01:33:59.934
Into my life. You know all about
my little girl, my family!

01:33:59.967 --> 01:34:01.969
Do you know how violated
that makes me feel?

01:34:02.003 --> 01:34:03.404
What, am I
a bad person, too?

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:05.706
No, you're the best
person I've ever met.

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:24.358
We're leaving.

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:28.963
We're moving to
Nashville next month.

01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:36.737
What will you do?
I don't know.

01:34:36.771 --> 01:34:38.906
I don't know, besides knock on the
door of that school every day

01:34:38.939 --> 01:34:40.274
until they let Daisy in.

01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:42.743
She's no closer to getting
in by being here.

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:44.045
I meant, for you.

01:34:51.185 --> 01:34:53.320
I am so thankful
that we met,

01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:55.823
and whether this was
real or not...

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:57.792
This was real. For me.

01:35:01.996 --> 01:35:03.130
For me, too.

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:08.736
I'm a better person
because of you.

01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:13.040
So am I.

01:35:17.578 --> 01:35:19.246
Take care
of yourself, Sam.

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:30.357
Good things happen
to good people.

01:35:34.361 --> 01:35:36.130

hope in that.

I'll be home tonight

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:32.920
A letter came for you.
From who?

01:36:32.953 --> 01:36:34.188
Why don't you take a look.

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:19.233
Shh. It's okay.

01:37:20.401 --> 01:37:21.902
We'll figure
something out.

No.

How well
do you manage adversity?

01:37:59.673 --> 01:38:01.976
Well, you've heard of the
fight or flight response.

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.945
I was really good
at the flight part.

01:38:04.979 --> 01:38:06.380
Problem is, I was

01:38:06.413 --> 01:38:08.616
equally good at convincing
people I was fighting.

01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:11.051
And now?

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:15.556
I'm tired of running
and getting nowhere.

01:38:17.057 --> 01:38:19.026
So, I figured
it was about time

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:21.962
to start fighting for
something bigger than myself.

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:30.204
Can you describe a time

01:38:30.237 --> 01:38:31.572
when you had to
demonstrate leadership?

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:37.378
I think I've always
been a natural leader.

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:41.448
It's where I've led people
that's been the problem.

01:38:43.784 --> 01:38:45.319
So, that's why I'm here.

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:48.088
What do you have to offer us?

outta here.

Your intelligence?

01:38:56.263 --> 01:38:57.431
Yeah, that...

01:38:58.465 --> 01:39:01.468
Computers, Internet.

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:05.372
Obtaining political
and military information.

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:07.341
Fighting with my fingers,
you know?

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:10.611
Care to explain?

01:39:11.812 --> 01:39:13.447
I can destroy networks.

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:18.085
Penetrate enemy computers
to steal or manipulate data.

01:39:18.118 --> 01:39:21.689
I can release a worm to take down control
and command systems of our enemies,

01:39:21.722 --> 01:39:24.391
so they can't communicate
with ground forces.

01:39:24.425 --> 01:39:26.493
Or fire
surface-to-air missiles.
