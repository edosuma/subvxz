A CHEMICAL
OF MY OWN INVENTION

10:20.586 --> 10:23.322
THAT WILL MAKE ANY
DISGUISED DRAGON

10:23.322 --> 10:24.690
REVERT TO ITS TRUE FORM.

10:24.690 --> 10:27.593
BUT ONCE I USE IT
TO EXPOSE
THIS SCHOOL'S DRAGON,

10:27.593 --> 10:29.462
I'LL HAVE THE FUNDING
TO MASS PRODUCE

10:29.462 --> 10:31.330
ALL THE BRONKIUM
I COULD EVER WANT.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.432
DRAGON'S EVERYWHERE
WILL BE UNMASKED.

10:33.432 --> 10:38.537
AND THE NAME
SIGMUND BRONK
WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.673
BUT, OF COURSE,
WE REGULAR HUMANS

10:40.673 --> 10:42.808
HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR.
NOW, DO WE?

10:42.808 --> 10:47.413
NOPE. GUESS YOU'LL
JUST BE WASTING
YOUR ONLY VIAL THEN, HUH?

10:47.413 --> 10:48.581
[BELL RINGS]

10:48.581 --> 10:52.585
IT'S RECESS.
CAN WE HANG OUT
WITH YOU?

10:52.585 --> 10:55.821
NOW WHO WANTS TO LEARN
EXTREME FOUR SQUARE?

10:55.821 --> 10:57.456
I DO! I DO!

10:57.456 --> 10:58.524
[ALL CHEERING]

10:58.524 --> 11:01.727
ANY TIME YOU WANT
TO TALK, JAKE.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.462
RIGHT ON.

11:03.462 --> 11:05.264
PEACE.

11:06.766 --> 11:07.900
OH, MAN!

11:10.936 --> 11:16.275
WITH THAT CHEMICAL,
BRONK IS BEYOND DANGEROUS.

11:16.275 --> 11:17.343
HE MUST BE STOPPED.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.878
YOU GOT ONE PRINCIPAL
FIRED, KID.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.446
TIME TO GET WORKING
ON THE SEQUEL.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.747
WHY DON'T I
JUST SNEAK IN,

11:21.747 --> 11:24.450
STEAL THE BRONKIUM,
AND GET RID OF IT?

11:24.450 --> 11:27.620
IF YOU WERE CAUGHT,
IT WOULD ONLY
PROVE TO HIM

11:27.620 --> 11:32.324
FU DOG IS RIGHT,
YOU MUST GET RID
OF YOUR PRINCIPAL.

11:32.324 --> 11:33.726
GET RID
OF YOUR PRINCIPAL?

11:33.726 --> 11:36.495
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO--

11:36.495 --> 11:37.530
DO YOU MIND?

11:37.530 --> 11:38.431
ROTWOOD?

11:38.431 --> 11:40.633
YOU, UH...
NEED SOME HELP?

11:40.633 --> 11:41.801
NEIN. NO, NO. NO, NO.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.602
I LOVE
THE SCAVENGING LIFE. AHA!

11:43.602 --> 11:47.306
FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU SEE A HALF EATEN
CAN OF SOUP.

11:47.306 --> 11:49.575
I SEE A HILARIOUS
NOVELTY HAT.

11:49.575 --> 11:51.644
PUT HER THERE.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.347
NO, WHO AM I KIDDING?

11:55.347 --> 11:56.515
THIS IS A CRUEL WORLD.

11:56.515 --> 11:58.984
WHICH HAS THE CAPACITY
TO SMASH DREAMS.

11:58.984 --> 12:02.521
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
WITH YOUR NEW PRINCIPAL.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.523
PRINCIPAL BRONK
IS A FREAK.

12:04.523 --> 12:06.659
YES, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'M SURE HE'S A VERY--

12:06.659 --> 12:10.563
BRONK! SURELY YOU DO NOT
MEAN SIGMUND BRONK.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.299
UH...YEAH.
YOU KNOW HIM?

12:13.299 --> 12:13.933
KNOW HIM?

12:13.933 --> 12:17.737
HE WAS MY PROFESSOR
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.306
IT WAS HE
WHO OPENED MY EYES

12:20.306 --> 12:22.875
TO THE UNSEEN MAGICAL WORLD.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.611
HE CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER.

12:25.611 --> 12:27.847
BUT BRONK WAS TOO HARSH
A TASK MASTER.

12:27.847 --> 12:32.518
HE EXPLODED WITH RAGE
AT THE SLIGHTEST MISTAKE.

12:32.518 --> 12:36.655
BUT I'D STILL TAKE YOU
OVER BRONK ANY DAY.

12:36.655 --> 12:41.026
AND I WOULD RETURN
IN A HEARTBEAT
IF I COULD.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.565
HEY, EVERYBODY.

12:46.565 --> 12:49.034
I HAVE A SURPRISE.

12:56.642 --> 12:58.611
DON'T TAKE MOM'S
REACTION TOO PERSONALLY.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.045
SHE BEATS ALL
OUR HOUSE GUESTS

13:00.045 --> 13:01.647
OVER THE HEAD
WITH A BROOM.

13:01.647 --> 13:03.649
IT'S, UH, JUST HER WAY.

13:03.649 --> 13:04.750
AH...

13:04.750 --> 13:05.918
I SEE I'M NOT
THE ONLY ONE

13:05.918 --> 13:08.454
WITH AN INTERESTING
MAGICAL CREATURE.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.456
HUH? OH, YEAH. UM...

13:10.456 --> 13:13.325
FAMILY TRIP
TO DRAGON HEAD VENTURES
AMUSEMENT PARK.

13:13.325 --> 13:14.493
GOOD TIMES.

13:14.493 --> 13:17.763
I HAVE NEVER HEARD
OF THIS AMUSEMENT PARK.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.565
YO, JAKEY J,
LET'S GO, BABY.

13:19.565 --> 13:22.601
I'M TAKING SPUD
ONION SHOPPING, YOU WANNA--

13:22.601 --> 13:25.304
AAH! ANOTHER
BASEMENT CRITTER.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.606
LOOK, IT'S KIND OF
A LONG STORY.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.809
BUT ME AND ROTWOOD
ARE WORKING TOGETHER

13:29.809 --> 13:31.644
TO GET BRONK FIRED.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.345
I STARTED
WORKING UP A PLAN.

13:33.345 --> 13:34.346
BUT I'M GONNA NEED
YOUR HELP.

13:34.346 --> 13:35.481
HERE'S WHAT
I'M THINKING.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.584
ME, TRIXIE AND SPUD
WILL, UH, ARRIVE

13:38.584 --> 13:42.721
ON THE SCHOOL ROOFTOP
TOMORROW AT 5:03AM.

13:42.721 --> 13:44.490
WHILE TRIX AND I
ACCESS THE SCHOOL

13:44.490 --> 13:48.861
SPUD WILL SUCTION CUP
ACROSS THE EAST SIDE
OF THE BUILDING,

13:48.861 --> 13:51.463
AND CUT THE SECURITY
CAMERA WIRES.

13:51.463 --> 13:55.501
ONCE THAT'S DONE,
I'LL LET IN
ONE OF THE LUNCH LADIES.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.337
WHO WILL THEN FLIRT
WITH THE SECURITY GUARD

13:58.337 --> 14:00.973
AND GET HIM TO UNLOCK
THE CAFETERIA DOOR.

14:00.973 --> 14:03.676
AND HOW ARE WE GONNA
LET Y'ALL IN?

14:03.676 --> 14:06.545
THAT'S THE THING.
IT WON'T BE
THE LUNCH LADY.

14:06.545 --> 14:11.951
WHILE HE STANDS GUARD,
I'LL CLIMB INTO
THE AIR VENT,

14:11.951 --> 14:13.018
FOLLOW IT TO BRONK'S OFFICE,

14:13.018 --> 14:15.654
AND USE, MY, UH,
SPECIAL SKILLS

14:15.654 --> 14:18.090
TO BORROW THE SCHOOL'S
FUNDRAISER CASH.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.758
WHEN THE SAFE
IS DISCOVERED EMPTY,

14:19.758 --> 14:22.795
THEY'LL BLAME
THE ONLY DUDE
WITH THE COMBINATION.

14:22.795 --> 14:26.532
AND LATER, WE CAN
ANONYMOUSLY
RETURN THE MONEY.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.034
WHOO-HOO!
IT'S WUNDERBAR!

14:29.034 --> 14:31.036
LET'S ROLL!

14:31.670 --> 14:35.741
OH! DIDN'T YOUR MOTHERS
TEACH YOU HOW TO
TREAT A LADY?

14:35.741 --> 14:37.543

MY OLD PUPIL.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.944
SOMEHOW I ALWAYS
PICTURED YOU

PRETTY MUCH
EXACTLY LIKE THIS.

14:41.580 --> 14:44.950
HELP!
IT'S SUCKING MY BRAIN.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.019
GET IT OFF! GET IT OFF!

14:47.019 --> 14:48.053
OH, BY THE WAY, JAKE,

14:48.053 --> 14:49.989
YOU LEFT YOUR PLANS
ON THE ROOF.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.824
YOU WERE TRYING
TO SET ME UP!

14:51.824 --> 14:53.626
WHAT? NO! I--

14:53.626 --> 14:54.526
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST COME CLEAN

14:54.526 --> 14:56.061
ABOUT THE DRAGON'S
IDENTITY?

14:56.061 --> 14:58.530
SAVE ME SOME TIME
AND A WORLD OF MISERY.

14:58.530 --> 15:03.702
RELAX, JAKE, I'M JUST
MAKING THE MORNING
ANNOUNCEMENTS.

15:03.702 --> 15:04.937
HOLA, STUDENTS.

15:04.937 --> 15:07.606
THIS IS YOUR PAL
PRINCIPAL BRONK.

15:07.606 --> 15:08.841
I AM SAD TO INFORM YOU

15:08.841 --> 15:12.478
TO HAVE ME FIRED
FROM THIS SCHOOL.

15:12.478 --> 15:14.013
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

15:14.013 --> 15:18.450
BUT I SUPPOSE JAKE LONG
IN HOMEROOM 217,

15:18.450 --> 15:19.518
LOCKER NUMBER A331

15:19.518 --> 15:22.554
IS ENTITLED TO HIS
OWN OPINION OF ME.

15:22.554 --> 15:23.656
THAT IS ALL.
[TURNS MIC OFF]

15:23.656 --> 15:27.760
YOU CAN HELP ME,
OR YOU CAN CONTINUE
TO SUFFER.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.196
SAY HI TO YOUR
CLASSMATES FOR ME.

15:31.196 --> 15:32.498
THAT'S THE BRONK HATER.

15:32.498 --> 15:35.567
I HEAR HE BEAT UP
THE SCHOOL MASCOT.

15:36.635 --> 15:38.804
WHERE ARE YOU GOING,

15:38.804 --> 15:41.440
[LAUGHING NERVOUSLY]
HOW'S IT GOING, GUYS?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.542

THE HOT LUNCH LADY
FIRED, TOO.

15:49.581 --> 15:52.117
I LIVE FOR THAT SAUCE.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.786

16:13.639 --> 16:16.075
OH, YEAH, LIKE THE TIME
I GAVE YOU A WEEK'S
DETENTION

16:16.075 --> 16:18.744
FOR SAYING, "OH,"
AND ANOTHER WEEK
FOR SAYING "MAN."

16:18.744 --> 16:22.548
OR THE TIME I PUT
MONDO BONDO GLUE AROUND
YOUR MONOCLE FRAME.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.650
OR THE TIME
I GAVE YOU DETENTION

16:24.650 --> 16:26.085
WHILE YOU WERE IN
DETENTION.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.854

16:33.659 --> 16:35.561

TELEPROMPTER.

16:35.561 --> 16:38.497
YOU ARE THE RIFFRAFF
THAT GOT ME FIRED.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.065
I JUST CHANGED ONE LINE.

16:40.065 --> 16:43.802
KNOW THIS DAY THAT YOU
HAVE MADE A POWERFUL
NEW ENEMY.

16:43.802 --> 16:47.506
YES, I TECHNICALLY,
AM AN OLD ENEMY WHO
WASN'T FOR AWHILE,

16:47.506 --> 16:48.674
BUT NOW AGAIN IS

16:48.674 --> 16:51.510

WHAT I'M SAYING!

16:51.510 --> 16:54.646
NO, WAIT! COME BACK!

16:55.014 --> 16:56.215
AH, DON'T SWEAT IT, KID.

16:56.215 --> 16:57.816

THAT CAN HAPPEN?

16:57.816 --> 17:00.219
YES. THE PHOTO
IS QUITE REAL.

17:00.219 --> 17:03.589
I'VE SENT IT TO EVERY
NEWS ORGANIZATION
IN THE CITY.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.290
I WILL PROVE THE PHOTO'S
AUTHENTICITY

17:05.290 --> 17:06.724
AT A PRESS CONFERENCE
TOMORROW.

17:06.724 --> 17:09.627
YES. THE DRAGON IS
MASQUERADING AS A HUMAN,

AT SCHOOL IS--

17:27.880 --> 17:29.681
INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE?

17:29.681 --> 17:32.551
A GROSS,
FIRE-BREATHING DRAGON.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.652
OH, MAN!

17:33.652 --> 17:35.654

17:35.654 --> 17:37.256
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE HIM
WITH THE BRONKIUM.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.258
NO DRAGON WILL BE SAFE.

17:39.258 --> 17:41.226
SO, THEN WHAT DO WE DO?

17:41.226 --> 17:43.762
WE FINISH WHAT WE STARTED.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.330
YO, WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

17:45.330 --> 17:47.599

COME ON, LET'S GO
EXPOSE THE DRAGON.

19:07.045 --> 19:08.647
OH, AND JUST SO
HIS FRIENDS

19:08.647 --> 19:09.848
DON'T TRY ANY
FUNNY BUSINESS,

19:09.848 --> 19:13.752
YOU'RE ALL LOCKED UP.
WON'T THAT BE FUN?

19:15.921 --> 19:18.857
WHOA! HE'S GOT
THOSE CHILDREN IN A CAGE!

19:18.857 --> 19:20.726
THAT IS AN OUTRAGE.

19:20.726 --> 19:21.827
IS THIS AN OUTRAGE,

19:21.827 --> 19:23.228
OR WILL WHAT YOU'RE
ABOUT TO SEE

19:23.228 --> 19:26.298
REVOLUTIONIZE SCIENCE

19:26.298 --> 19:28.667
WATCH AND BELIEVE!

19:28.667 --> 19:32.171
ROTWOOD, ARE YOU SURE
HE'S THE ONE?

19:32.437 --> 19:34.139
[SIGHS]
THIS IS IT, GUYS.

19:34.139 --> 19:35.407
THIS IS HOW IT ENDS.

19:35.407 --> 19:39.211
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
BEHOLD THE MIGHTY DRAGON.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.245

19:43.982 --> 19:47.352

20:01.400 --> 20:03.902
YOU TOLD ME
HE WAS THE DRAGON.

20:03.902 --> 20:05.437
BUT IT, IT MUST BE HIM.

20:05.437 --> 20:10.776
LOOK AT HIM.
STEAM'S COMING OUT OF
HIS MOUTH RIGHT NOW.

20:11.276 --> 20:15.447
A DRAGON AT THIS SCHOOL?
[LAUGHING]

20:15.447 --> 20:19.017
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR
FANTASTICAL DELUSIONS,
PRINCIPAL.

20:19.017 --> 20:21.820
WHAT I CARE ABOUT
ARE THE CHILDREN.

20:21.820 --> 20:25.991
THE BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN
OF THE WORLD.

20:25.991 --> 20:29.461
Man: YOU SHOULD BE
RUNNING THIS SCHOOL,
NOT HIM.

20:29.461 --> 20:30.395
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

20:30.395 --> 20:33.398
ONE OF THOSE KIDS
IS A DRAGON!

20:33.398 --> 20:36.001
A DRAGON!

20:37.236 --> 20:38.470
HEY, STACY.

20:38.470 --> 20:40.973
FAKER!

20:41.506 --> 20:42.941
WHAT'S UP WITH HER?

20:42.941 --> 20:43.909
SHE SAW ME EATING
THE ONION

20:43.909 --> 20:47.446
AND SHE WAS ABLE TO PUT
TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.

20:47.446 --> 20:51.250
BUT NO MATTER,
ONCE I FINISH WHITTLING
MY ONION STACY,

20:51.250 --> 20:53.485
I'LL ALWAYS HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL SHOULDER TO...

20:53.485 --> 20:56.321
[SNIFFING] CRY ON.
[CRYING]

20:56.321 --> 21:01.526
OW! HER BEAUTIFUL,
STINGING JUICES.

21:01.526 --> 21:03.262
[CRYING HYSTERICALLY]

21:03.262 --> 21:06.031
YOU EVER THINK WE DIDN'T
GIVE ROTWOOD
ENOUGH CREDIT?

21:06.031 --> 21:09.901
HOW HE PRANKED BRONK
AND GOT HIS OLD
JOB BACK.

21:09.901 --> 21:13.305
PLEASE, YOU THINK
THAT WAS PLANNED?

21:13.305 --> 21:14.406
ROTWOOD'S SO CLUELESS.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.775
HE PROBABLY DID THINK
THE DRAGON--

21:16.775 --> 21:17.809
JAKE LONG!
HUH?

21:17.809 --> 21:20.779
I WOULD LIKE
TO SHAKE YOUR HAND.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.514
TO THANK YOU.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.449
UH, SURE.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.189
HUH? WHAT THE--

21:32.357 --> 21:34.493
SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

21:35.994 --> 21:37.195
ONE DROP LEFT.

21:37.195 --> 21:41.533
IT SEEMED A SHAME
TO LET IT ALL GO TO WASTE.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.202
OH, DON'T BOTHER,
MR. LONG.

21:44.202 --> 21:46.338
I ALWAYS SUSPECTED
IT WAS YOU.

21:46.338 --> 21:47.906
BUT I'LL BE
A SHRINE PRINCE UNCLE

21:47.906 --> 21:51.443
BEFORE I LET SIGMUND BRONK
TAKE CREDIT FOR MY DISCOVERY.

21:51.443 --> 21:55.213
I WILL FIND A WAY
TO EXPOSE YOU MYSELF ONE DAY.

21:55.213 --> 21:58.583
BUT UNTIL THEN,
I'VE GOT A SCHOOL TO RUN.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.952
TA!

22:03.588 --> 22:05.223
OH, MAN!

22:08.260 --> 22:13.465
HEY, I WONDER WHAT OTHER
MAGICAL SECRETS
THAT GUY KNOWS?

22:13.465 --> 22:17.302
Rotwood: THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE?
ACTUALLY A TRAPEZOID.

22:17.302 --> 22:20.505
PIXIE DUST MADE FROM
REAL PIXIES.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.507
[SCREAMING]

22:22.507 --> 22:26.478
BIG FOOT, QUITE LOVELY
IN ANKLE-HIGH
STILETTO BOOTS.

22:26.478 --> 22:29.614
WOW! HELLO, MADAME SASQUATCH.

22:29.614 --> 22:31.350
HUMMA HUMMA HUMMA.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.519
BUT, OF COURSE,
A FOOT RUB WILL BE
NO PROBLEM FOR--

22:34.519 --> 22:36.288
AAH! YOU PEOPLE
ARE STILL HERE?

22:36.288 --> 22:37.222
YOU SAW NOTHING.
