00:12.651 --> 00:13.577
I don't like it.

00:14.278 --> 00:15.568
What do you make of it, Kowalski?

00:15.745 --> 00:17.840
I'm not sure, Skipper.
It could be anything.

00:17.920 --> 00:18.657
Oh, really?

00:18.833 --> 00:20.024
Could it be Alaska?

00:20.104 --> 00:22.230
N-n-no, it's probably not a

00:22.310 --> 00:24.093
are you saying alaska might be

00:24.173 --> 00:27.402
stuck upside down to the clock tower of my zoo?

00:27.633 --> 00:28.516
I guess...

00:28.596 --> 00:30.501
Because I think people would notice

00:30.581 --> 00:33.824
if the entire state of Alaska just packed up and...

00:34.221 --> 00:35.246
moved to the zoo.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.629
All right, maybe it couldn't be anything.

00:38.952 --> 00:40.750
I'm sorry, boys.

00:40.926 --> 00:43.055
I sometimes resort to sarcasm

00:43.135 --> 00:44.533
when facing the unknown.

00:44.613 --> 00:45.956
No duh.

00:46.893 --> 00:49.011
No one knows anything about it, Skipper.

00:49.091 --> 00:51.128
It just showed up mysteriously in the night.

00:51.404 --> 00:52.342
All right, people.

00:52.422 --> 00:54.382
We have an unauthorized gray lump.

00:54.713 --> 00:55.772
I need answers.

00:57.338 --> 00:59.798
This looks like a job for science!

01:07.067 --> 01:09.295
Come on, science, don't let me down.

01:11.159 --> 01:12.118
Who poke stick?

01:12.515 --> 01:14.567
You like poke? Vee poke, okay?

01:14.647 --> 01:15.857
I sting your face.

01:16.441 --> 01:18.205
Skipper, it's a hornet's nest.

01:18.285 --> 01:20.444
Hey, look who vin prize?

01:20.524 --> 01:22.077
You know vat's dee prize?

01:22.157 --> 01:23.036
I sting your face.

01:28.375 --> 01:30.029
Easy, now, stingtail.

01:30.109 --> 01:31.544
We don't want any trouble.

01:31.765 --> 01:34.456
We're just questioning your choice of nest location.

01:34.754 --> 01:36.893
Oh, and I have question for you.

01:36.973 --> 01:37.676
Knock, knock.

01:37.756 --> 01:38.316
Who's there?

01:38.396 --> 01:40.522
I sting your face. Sting, sting, sting.

01:40.602 --> 01:42.110
Knock it off. knock it off!

01:42.691 --> 01:44.952
There is a whole park out there.

01:45.032 --> 01:47.897
We could find you a secluded glade, perhaps.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.389
This is a children's zoo. With children.

01:50.469 --> 01:51.470
Is okay.

01:51.550 --> 01:54.294
Vee sting the childrens enough, they don't come back.

01:54.481 --> 01:56.147
Whoa, stingtail.

01:56.227 --> 01:58.154
Nobody threatens the kiddies in my zoo.

01:58.234 --> 02:00.668
Consider your pointy keister out of here.

02:03.911 --> 02:06.382
With all the other pointy keisters.

02:06.462 --> 02:07.915
Less talk, more sting.

02:26.549 --> 02:29.594
Okay, they surprised us the first time.

02:29.674 --> 02:33.277
Took away our greatest weapons:
stealth and superior tactics.

02:33.357 --> 02:35.616
Well, that ain't gonna happen twice.

02:36.034 --> 02:38.868
It happened twice. it happened twice!

02:40.004 --> 02:41.956
This does not wash.

02:42.133 --> 02:43.942
We're penguins. They're insects.

02:44.022 --> 02:45.751
We've got the size advantage.

02:45.831 --> 02:47.990
But, Skipper, they've got the owie advantage.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.056
We can't take out their nest without entering a world of pain.

02:53.225 --> 02:56.148
Kowalski, where are we on eliminating pain?

02:56.228 --> 02:58.012
Way ahead of you, Skipper.

02:58.092 --> 03:01.100
I've just been perfecting a pain elimination helmet.

03:02.435 --> 03:03.394
As you'll see.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.516
The neuron-inhibiting matrix

03:06.596 --> 03:09.472
provides 100% protection from all forms of

03:10.950 --> 03:12.185
It's not perfected!

03:12.265 --> 03:15.472
Oh, it hurts! it hurts so bad!

03:16.233 --> 03:17.744
It's a fools dream.

03:17.824 --> 03:21.251
To live without pain, you'd have to be uniquely freakish.

03:21.331 --> 03:22.983
Did I drop a mango down here?

03:30.447 --> 03:32.311
There you are, mango.

03:33.856 --> 03:34.826
No pain.

03:34.906 --> 03:37.076
It's like it never happened.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.681
You want me to talk to the bees?

03:43.761 --> 03:45.732
Hornets, and talk ain't gonna cut it.

03:45.812 --> 03:48.743
This mission requires harsh, decisive action.

03:49.019 --> 03:50.497
Kisses and huggies?

03:51.766 --> 03:54.258
We. Need you.

03:54.338 --> 03:56.542
To go up there.

03:56.622 --> 03:58.064
And remove.

03:58.144 --> 03:59.244
The hornet's.

03:59.324 --> 04:00.479
Nest.

04:01.822 --> 04:03.884
Can I play in the beehive?

04:03.964 --> 04:05.077
Hornets!

04:05.235 --> 04:07.432
Vat? You want more sting?

04:07.512 --> 04:08.808
He wants the sting.

04:08.888 --> 04:11.897
I sting you so hard, your
grand-grand-children say "ouch".

04:11.977 --> 04:12.986
Retreat!

04:21.582 --> 04:24.044
Sting, sting, sting, sting, sting, sting!

04:26.310 --> 04:28.331
It makes me polka-dotty.

04:30.352 --> 04:31.463
It's hopeless, Skipper.

04:31.543 --> 04:33.660
Mort simply doesn't understand the job.

04:33.916 --> 04:35.972
Is this a waffle maker?

04:36.170 --> 04:37.785
No, that's a fusion incinerator

04:39.134 --> 04:41.252
Oh, I bet this one makes bubbles, right?

04:41.332 --> 04:43.078
Doesn't... understand.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.137
Of course!

04:45.637 --> 04:47.349
Mm, of course.

04:47.799 --> 04:48.461
What?

04:48.541 --> 04:49.706
If I'm correct...

04:51.648 --> 04:52.071
"If".

04:52.530 --> 04:55.495
These brain energy-reading goggles should prove...

04:57.444 --> 04:58.036
Yes.

04:58.852 --> 05:02.028
It seems Mort is being protected by a field of ignorance.

05:02.108 --> 05:03.767
He doesn't know he's in danger,

05:04.093 --> 05:05.611
and therefore he feels nothing.

05:06.670 --> 05:07.958
Shouldn't someone stop that?

05:08.584 --> 05:10.720
I smell burning cookies.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.220
Fascinating theory, Kowalski.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.394
But how does that eighty-six the hornet's nest?

05:14.474 --> 05:15.392
Don't you see, Skipper?

05:15.472 --> 05:19.292
If we simply erase every single painful thought from our minds,

05:19.372 --> 05:21.347
we can be as painlessly ignorant as Mort.

05:21.533 --> 05:22.292
Outstanding.

05:22.671 --> 05:26.227
Where can we find an instrument that could wipe out all brain functions?

05:26.307 --> 05:30.224
Okay, now, this is definitely a job for science.

05:34.312 --> 05:35.917
Gentlemen, I give you...

05:36.332 --> 05:37.938
the degausser.

05:38.176 --> 05:41.362
One electromagno zap, and the mind goes as blank as mort's.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.382
Instant halo-of-ignorance protection.

05:43.462 --> 05:44.409
Is it dangerous?

05:44.489 --> 05:46.200
Just a little incredibly so.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.206
But don't worry.

05:47.286 --> 05:50.294
All your brain power will be stored inside this cardboard box

05:50.374 --> 05:51.670
until the hornet job is complete.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.576
Private, give that man a brain.

05:55.793 --> 05:58.864
Okay, let's get stupid.

06:08.021 --> 06:09.697
Private, are you all right? 

06:09.777 --> 06:10.536
How do you feel? 

06:12.362 --> 06:14.621
Rico, my medical supplies. 

06:20.896 --> 06:23.128
Ooh, is that a cotton candy machine? 

06:23.208 --> 06:25.219
I like cotton candy. 

06:26.887 --> 06:27.752
Ooh, tickly! 

06:27.832 --> 06:28.916
Eureka! 

06:28.996 --> 06:30.937
Stupid mission accomplished. 

06:31.017 --> 06:34.400
Now all we have to do is point him at the hornet's nest, and

06:34.480 --> 06:36.729
oh, pretty shiny light machine. 

06:36.809 --> 06:38.697
No, no, not the degausser! 

06:38.909 --> 06:40.550
I'm a disco penguin. 

06:40.630 --> 06:41.909
Be careful! 

06:49.377 --> 06:50.338
Hello? 

06:51.247 --> 06:53.647
I like degaussing. 

07:01.451 --> 07:02.342
Hello.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.780
Hello.

07:04.768 --> 07:06.789
Hurry, I see school bus coming. 

07:06.869 --> 07:08.254
Ah, school bus. 

07:08.334 --> 07:10.954
Is like gift box of children for stinging. 

07:13.195 --> 07:15.198
Did you make friends with the bees yet? 

07:15.278 --> 07:18.321
Bee, yay!

07:25.243 --> 07:26.417
Here they come. 

07:26.497 --> 07:30.149
 Is going to be busy children-stinging day today. 

07:31.852 --> 07:33.396
Bees!

07:33.476 --> 07:35.382
Why you come back now for? 

07:35.462 --> 07:38.214
Hey, maybe they like the sting. 

07:38.294 --> 07:40.208
Then vee give the sting. 

07:40.288 --> 07:41.408
We sting your face!

07:42.437 --> 07:43.955
Bees!

07:46.629 --> 07:48.208
Bees!

07:48.702 --> 07:50.379
Bees.

07:56.964 --> 07:58.516
I ate soap.

07:58.596 --> 08:00.414
The sting, it does nothing. 

08:00.494 --> 08:02.064
How the sting does nothing? 

08:02.144 --> 08:03.325
You sting wrong. 

08:03.405 --> 08:04.523
Why you criticize? 

08:04.603 --> 08:06.676
You always have puny sting. 

08:06.756 --> 08:08.194
 I have feelings. 

08:10.956 --> 08:12.685
We cannot stop them. 

08:13.505 --> 08:17.114
What is all this loud talk about stinging

08:17.396 --> 08:20.423
all day long, until the royal nap is ruined? 

08:20.740 --> 08:21.799
Ruined! 

08:24.388 --> 08:26.700
The feet!

08:26.780 --> 08:27.450
 What? 

08:28.041 --> 08:28.809
What are you

08:33.565 --> 08:35.082
The royal feet. 

08:40.881 --> 08:41.746
What the

08:41.966 --> 08:44.481
Okay, back to children stinging. 

08:48.368 --> 08:51.906
The royal feet are mine. 

08:52.444 --> 08:55.118
And I will have

08:55.198 --> 08:57.968
Vengeance!

08:59.018 --> 09:00.271
Okay, be right back. 

09:05.147 --> 09:08.041
What if I hug something special of yours, huh? 

09:08.121 --> 09:09.409
How about that? 

09:09.489 --> 09:11.527
How about I hug your brainy box? 

09:19.952 --> 09:21.690
Thoughts returning. 

09:23.874 --> 09:25.992
Picked up... some of... Rico's...

09:26.689 --> 09:29.283
saw... horrible... 

09:31.180 --> 09:31.912
Sorry.

09:32.786 --> 09:34.815
Skipper, children.

09:38.751 --> 09:39.712
Hot fudge.

09:39.792 --> 09:42.070
they're going to dive-bomb those schoolkids. 

09:42.150 --> 09:43.678
Skipper, what do we do? 

09:43.758 --> 09:46.114
Without our halo of ignorance, we're powerless to stop them. 

09:46.194 --> 09:48.046
We have bees? 

09:48.126 --> 09:48.752
Actually, they're

09:48.832 --> 09:50.622
Bees make honey. 

09:50.861 --> 09:53.579
Why do I not have delicious bee honey

09:53.659 --> 09:55.193
in my belly right now?

09:55.273 --> 09:56.702
I will get the honey. 

09:56.782 --> 09:57.549
Mort, no! 

09:57.629 --> 09:58.555
They're hornets, not

09:58.635 --> 09:59.870
Bees! 

10:03.357 --> 10:06.250
My favorite part is the screaming. 

10:06.330 --> 10:07.177
And we go. 

10:10.714 --> 10:13.335
The nest! the nest! 

10:13.415 --> 10:13.899
What? 

10:13.979 --> 10:15.351
This a monster.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.010
Hello, bees. 

10:17.090 --> 10:19.763
Where are you hiding the honey? 

10:19.843 --> 10:22.728
I need it for king julien to love me. 

10:23.098 --> 10:25.551
The nest, it is kaputted. Flee! flee for your lives! 

10:25.631 --> 10:27.820
Flee! flee for your lives! 

10:29.496 --> 10:30.617
All right! 

10:31.927 --> 10:33.056
He did it. 

10:33.303 --> 10:35.615
Sad eyes actually did the job. 

10:35.695 --> 10:39.285
Truly, his powers are too mighty for such mere mortals as we. 

10:39.365 --> 10:40.926
Oh, come back, bees! 

10:45.350 --> 10:48.994
Mort, this is the worst honey I have ever licked. 

10:49.074 --> 10:49.903
Can I have some? 

10:49.983 --> 10:51.676
Of course not, you greedy. 

10:51.853 --> 10:53.132
It is for the king. 

10:55.543 --> 10:57.140
So terrible. 

10:59.028 --> 11:00.096
I sting your face.
