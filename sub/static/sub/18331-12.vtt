OK, Operation Surprise Photo for DJ
is a go.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.611
I wanna see Christmas spirit
and I wanna see Yuletide cheer.

01:11.321 --> 01:14.032
What's the difference between
Christmas spirit and Yuletide cheer?

01:14.115 --> 01:15.867
I also wanna see a silent night.

01:17.619 --> 01:20.955
[Spanish accent] Can we hurry this up?
It's 100 degrees in this suit.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.543
My chestnuts are roasting on an open fire.

01:26.961 --> 01:29.839
Come on, you guys, let's get this done
before Kimmy comes home with DJ.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.635
Here we go, see, it's great.
Uh oh, DJ, don't walk through this door.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.512
Why can't I walk through the d...

01:35.595 --> 01:40.141
[gasps] Oh, Mylanta,
you're taking a family photo!

01:40.225 --> 01:41.518
Oh, OK, I was never here.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.479
But since I am...

01:46.397 --> 01:48.316
I always keep one handy in December.

01:49.651 --> 01:53.571
-OK, everybody say "Cheese log."
-Cheese log!

01:53.655 --> 01:54.739
[camera clicks]

01:54.823 --> 01:58.201
Oh, email me one of those.
I wanna send it to Matt in India.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.495
Who has a dad that lives in India?

02:00.578 --> 02:03.081
Uh, I'm guessing a lot of Indians.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.791
[doorbell rings]

02:04.874 --> 02:06.084
It's always open!

02:07.252 --> 02:08.628
Hey, you guys.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.380
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.216
OK, we've got an after-hour
sick pet situation.

02:13.299 --> 02:16.803
This is my daughter, Rose,
and this is her bunny rabbit, Jack,

02:16.886 --> 02:18.221
who's not feeling so good.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.684
I named him after Jack from Titanic.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.061
It's my all-time favorite movie.

02:26.396 --> 02:30.441
Oh, Titanic is Max's favorite movie too,
isn't it Max?

02:30.525 --> 02:33.403
[romantic music plays]

02:37.740 --> 02:39.075
[thinking] Why can't I talk?

02:39.617 --> 02:40.910
I must be in heaven

02:40.994 --> 02:43.413
'cause I'm looking at an angel.

02:43.496 --> 02:46.166
Boy, it's windy in heaven.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.006
-So what's wrong with your rabbit?
-He won't eat.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.592
You hear that, DJ? "He won't eat."

02:57.427 --> 02:59.637
I have no idea what that's like,
but I mean...

03:01.222 --> 03:02.473
it sounds serious.

03:03.391 --> 03:06.352
Well, I am happy to watch him overnight.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.939
You don't mind having a little friend
over, do you, Cosmo?

03:10.023 --> 03:11.524
[romantic music plays]

03:11.608 --> 03:13.693
[sighs] Cosmo don't mind.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.323
[Cosmo thinking] Hey there, honey bunny.

03:18.406 --> 03:21.534
Wait, am I still wearing
these dumb antlers?

03:21.618 --> 03:25.663
What I put up with
for a can of dog food!

03:27.957 --> 03:30.460
Oh, and when you come back tomorrow
to pick up Jack,

03:30.543 --> 03:32.128
Max and Rose can have a playdate.

03:32.211 --> 03:33.755
Would you guys like that?

03:34.339 --> 03:35.256
If Max wants to.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.549
Yes, I do!

03:37.967 --> 03:40.678
I mean, sure,
I can move some things around.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.181
[CJ] Thanks, Deej.

03:43.264 --> 03:47.977
We should head out. FedEx is delivering
the rest of my Nativity scene tonight.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.104
They forgot the baby Jesus.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.359
It's just not the same
with my Urkel doll in the manger.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.444
Bye.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.238
See you tomorrow, Max.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.744
Oh, boy, looks like you've got your
first crush and you're already a mess.

04:05.787 --> 04:06.996
How do you know?

04:07.080 --> 04:12.418
Well, not to brag or anything, but being
awkward around girls is kinda my thing.

04:15.213 --> 04:20.468
Well, I will see you tomorrow,
Steph-a-roni, my San Francisco treat.

04:23.304 --> 04:25.723
OK. Oh, and don't forget
we have plans Christmas Eve

04:25.807 --> 04:27.475
to go watch Ramona dance The Nutcracker.

04:27.558 --> 04:28.893
-Right.
-OK.

04:29.602 --> 04:33.273
Oh, there's something important
I've been meaning to tell you, um...

04:33.356 --> 04:35.775
I've been thinking all day
about the right way to say it

04:35.858 --> 04:37.485
and I believe it's with words.

04:39.237 --> 04:43.157
And the words are:
I've been offered a job in Auckland.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.119
Woah... Auckland?

04:47.704 --> 04:48.871
Are you gonna take it?

04:49.497 --> 04:50.957
Maybe, I'm not sure.

04:51.958 --> 04:52.875
Wow, I...

04:53.751 --> 04:56.796
I mean, I don't wanna stand
in the way of your career, but...

04:56.879 --> 04:58.631
we're in such a good place.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.759
You know, I can't imagine
you being half a world away.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.387
I'm gonna miss you so much.

05:04.470 --> 05:08.558
Hey, I'm gonna miss you too,
but it's only a 30-minute drive.

05:12.770 --> 05:17.608
OK, wait, do you mean Oakland, California
or Auckland, New Zealand?

05:17.692 --> 05:19.861
Auckland, California.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.198
OK, hold on.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.783
-Say "Oak."
-Oak.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.618
-Now say "Land."
-Land.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.662
-Now say "Oakland."
-Auckland.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.623
I need to go lie down.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.753
Hey, hold on. Are you upset
because you thought I was gonna leave you?

05:36.836 --> 05:39.922
Steph, that'll never happen.
I love you, you're awesome.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.509
Wait, what did you just say?

05:43.593 --> 05:44.510
You're awesome.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.305
No, before that.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.848
Steph, that'll never happen.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.267
After that.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.019
You're awesome.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.273
OK, I really need to go lie down.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.358
OK.

06:00.651 --> 06:01.611
I love you.

06:03.654 --> 06:04.947
[silently]

06:08.367 --> 06:09.368
Hey, Ramona.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.120
Why did you send me a text

06:11.204 --> 06:13.956
saying you had to tell me something
you couldn't text?

06:14.040 --> 06:17.543
Because sometimes the written word
just doesn't tell the whole story.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.003
That's what emojis are for.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.215
Have a seat.

06:22.924 --> 06:26.135
So, you know how I'm playing
the Mouse King in The Nutcracker right?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.929
Well, the thing is...

06:29.472 --> 06:33.976
they extended the show
and I have to perform tomorrow night.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.146
But tomorrow night's
my Christmas Eve party.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.690
You're really not coming?

06:39.774 --> 06:42.110
I know. I feel so bad.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.405
This is the part
where you tell me you understand

06:46.489 --> 06:48.032
and we're still best friends.

06:48.950 --> 06:49.867
OK.

06:50.618 --> 06:51.702
I understand.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.205
I just wish you could come.

06:55.456 --> 06:56.666
Merry Christmas.

07:00.837 --> 07:01.712
Hey, Lola.

07:05.550 --> 07:06.467
What's this?

07:07.677 --> 07:08.970
Is it mistletoe?

07:10.304 --> 07:11.681
Not a good time.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.185
-Hi, Lola.
-Hi, Doctor Fuller.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.147
Oh! Mistletoe!

07:23.693 --> 07:27.113
-[whistling]
-Hey. I didn't know you were here.

07:27.196 --> 07:31.117
Steph, I wanna apologize
about what I said last night.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.536
Yeah, I wasn't expecting that at all.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.163
Turns out you were right.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.747
It's pronounced "oak-land."

07:40.668 --> 07:44.839
Anyways, I wanted to make it up to you so
I decided to build us a gingerbread house.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.675
I even built gingerbread Jimmy and Stepho.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.177
[laughs]

07:49.260 --> 07:52.972
Steph, you sure are sweet, and that's
not just 'cause you're mostly sugar.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.600
[giggles, mimics kissing]

07:55.683 --> 07:56.726
Cute.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.728
Cute? This is adorable.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.815
OK, yeah. It's adorable.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.233
You're acting weird.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.487
Is this because I said "I love you"
yesterday?

08:08.362 --> 08:11.199
What? You said that?
I didn't even hear it.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.118
Well, then I'll say it again.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.912
I love you.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.749
Well, I definitely...
I heard it that time.

08:21.459 --> 08:26.088
You know, sometimes when people say
"I love you," the other person says "I--"

08:26.172 --> 08:29.592
I thank you and I bid you a fond farewell.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.764
You didn't have to bite my head off!

08:36.265 --> 08:39.101
And now, onto my favorite herbivore,

08:39.644 --> 08:45.149
sauropods, which includes
the brachiosaurus, apatosaurus

08:45.233 --> 08:47.568
and dip, dip, dip--

08:47.652 --> 08:48.694
...lodicus.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.696
You're incredible!

08:52.073 --> 08:53.407
You're incredible-er.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.037
Rose, I could play it cool,

08:58.120 --> 09:00.414
but life is short.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.333
And so are we.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.421
What I'm trying to say is
you're my dream girl.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.049
[gasps]

09:10.132 --> 09:11.008
Max!

09:11.092 --> 09:12.385
Give me your hand.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.054
Now close your eyes.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.306
Take a step up.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.736
Do you trust me, Rose?

09:30.820 --> 09:31.862
I trust you.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.156
OK, now open your eyes.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.784
I'm flying, Max!

09:36.867 --> 09:38.411
[gasps]

09:38.494 --> 09:39.745
I'm flying!

09:40.788 --> 09:42.665
It's like we're on the Titanic.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.333
[sniffs]

09:44.417 --> 09:46.294
I can almost smell the ocean.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.880
Oh, no, that's my fish tank.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.011
I have something for you.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.596
Turn around.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.558
I hope you like it.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.728
Can you please pull up your hair?

10:06.230 --> 10:08.107
Oh, Max, you shouldn't have.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.526
Oh, yes, I should have.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.698
It's just like
Rose's necklace in the movie.

10:15.781 --> 10:16.616
Only...

10:17.325 --> 10:19.493
"Made in China."

10:23.956 --> 10:26.375
May I help you down, my darling?

10:26.459 --> 10:27.627
Why thank you.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.007
Rose, I don't want this playdate to end.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.593
Will you accompany me
to the ballet this evening?

10:35.676 --> 10:37.011
I would be delighted.

10:38.846 --> 10:39.805
M'lady.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.476
Why does Jackson find this so difficult?

10:50.900 --> 10:54.278
[giggles] Wow, merry Christmas to me!

10:56.530 --> 10:57.740
Good news for Jack.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.867
It was mild indigestion.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.995
No more pad thai before bedtime
for that little fella.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.330
[laughs]

11:05.039 --> 11:06.916
We have an announcement.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.918
We're in love.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.881
Wow, that was some playdate!

11:14.507 --> 11:17.885
Deej, is that the heart necklace
I gave you in Tenth Grade?

11:19.261 --> 11:22.014
-I don't know. Is it?
-Max, where did you get that?

11:22.098 --> 11:26.644
From a shoebox under my mom's bed
labeled "DJ and Steve forever."

11:28.229 --> 11:31.607
That is... not a thing that I have.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.485
It's right there. I forgot to put it away.

11:36.445 --> 11:37.780
[DJ giggles nervously]

11:37.863 --> 11:42.535
Oh!
You mean this "DJ and Steve forever" box.

11:43.619 --> 11:46.288
I just use this for my tax receipts.

11:46.914 --> 11:52.795
So it's actually a "DJ and Steve Goldfarb,
my accountant, forever" box.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.173
Well, if you'd excuse us,

11:56.257 --> 12:00.761
I'm going to go treat my true love
to a string cheese and an apple juice box.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.138
Oh, my goodness!

12:02.221 --> 12:04.515
Apple juice is my favorite kind of juice.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.434
-Except for--
-[both] Cranapple.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.602
Where have you been all my life?

12:10.438 --> 12:11.480
My mom's house.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.736
Why, thank you.

12:19.363 --> 12:22.741
Deej, I love that you kept that
silly little necklace all these years.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.995
You know, I won that for you
at the arcade on our fourth date.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.832
Oh, yeah, you surprised me with it
on the Ferris wheel.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.168
Oh, you were such a romantic.

12:37.339 --> 12:38.174
Hijita?

12:39.258 --> 12:42.803
I cannot wait to see you perform
as the Mouse King.

12:42.887 --> 12:46.849
It's every father's dream
to see his little girl play a giant rat.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.728
I just wish I didn't have to go tonight.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.897
But, honey, you're so good. What's wrong?

12:52.980 --> 12:56.358
[sighs] Lola's mad at me
because I have to miss her party.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.111
I feel like I'm about to
lose my best friend.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.033

27:01.953 --> 27:03.705
Mom, I need your earrings right now.

27:05.081 --> 27:07.208
Max, these are real gold.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.127
And this is real love.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.465
It's OK, Max.

27:13.548 --> 27:15.216
Our love isn't about gifts.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.719
It's about us being soul mates.

Feliz navidad, Tanner-itos!

Oh, Jimmy!

27:33.818 --> 27:34.861
Jimmy!

27:34.944 --> 27:36.237
Hi!

27:36.321 --> 27:40.533
Jimmy, your RV was gone.
I thought you'd left forever.

27:40.617 --> 27:43.370
Nah, I always save my shopping
for last minute.

27:43.453 --> 27:46.331
That's how I get Christmas gifts
at Hanukkah prices.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.751
I'm so sorry I pushed you away.

27:50.293 --> 27:51.503
I feel the same way you do.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.254
I love you. You're awesome.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.215
Wait, what did you say?

27:56.966 --> 27:58.176
I feel the same way you do.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.719
No, after that.

27:59.803 --> 28:02.055
-You're awesome.
-No, before that.

28:02.722 --> 28:03.556
I love you.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.601
I knew I heard that.

28:07.227 --> 28:09.437
I love you too, Steph-a-claus.

28:12.899 --> 28:15.860
OK, now can we please open some presents?

28:15.944 --> 28:18.780
-Yeah!

I hope she knows I don't dress myself.
