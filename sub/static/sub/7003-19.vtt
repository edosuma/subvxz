00:03.735 --> 00:05.737
Hi. Tim "the tool man"
taylor.

00:05.738 --> 00:09.107
And you all know my assistant
al "this land is" borland.

00:10.910 --> 00:12.343
Today we're talking about

00:12.344 --> 00:14.879
Binford's new high-tech
security alarm systems
for cars,

00:14.880 --> 00:18.382
'cause a secure car...
Is a happy car.

00:19.752 --> 00:22.020
While a car
that isn't so secure

00:22.021 --> 00:25.957
Can cost you
thousands of dollars
in therapy fees.

00:25.958 --> 00:28.994
The most inexpensive way
to protect your car

00:28.995 --> 00:33.498
Is with the binford 6100
steering-wheel lock.

00:33.499 --> 00:35.533
It's a good lock,
but if you've got
a larger car -

00:35.534 --> 00:38.236
A monster truck,
front-end loader
or a space shuttle -

00:38.237 --> 00:40.005
You want
the binford 61,000,000.

00:42.908 --> 00:45.744
Now, there's a lock.
Look at the size of that thing.

00:47.379 --> 00:50.481
Well, if you wanna go
the more sophisticated route...

00:50.482 --> 00:54.252
<i>(bad english accent)</i>
you might wanna watch
<i>masterpiece tool time</i>

00:54.253 --> 00:57.088
With your host
alistair bo-o-o-orland.

01:01.761 --> 01:03.762
Would that be
an english accent?

01:06.666 --> 01:08.833
I was talking
more along the lines

01:08.834 --> 01:12.137
Of an electric car alarm,
the most basic of which
will go off

01:12.138 --> 01:14.172
If your doors or windows
are tampered with.

01:14.173 --> 01:15.807
Right, but you can customize.

01:15.808 --> 01:19.377
You can have
automatic door locks,
ignition cutoff, gas cutoff.

01:19.378 --> 01:22.080
And not a moment too soon.

01:23.849 --> 01:26.151
Very funny, tim.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.519
I'm sure our
nursery-school viewers

01:28.520 --> 01:31.422
Are rolling
in their sandboxes.

01:31.423 --> 01:34.025
<i>(hisses)</i>

01:34.026 --> 01:36.627
Now, if you wanna go
the whole hog, you...

01:36.628 --> 01:38.563
No.

01:38.564 --> 01:41.766
You probably want
the binford thiefbuster 1000.

01:41.767 --> 01:43.768
It has a personalized
voice warning system.

01:43.769 --> 01:46.004
I installed it
on this pony myself.

01:47.106 --> 01:50.008
<i>(alarm chirps)</i>
act like a thief.

01:54.379 --> 01:57.082
<i>(tim's voice)</i>
<i>back away, flannel man!</i>
<i>Back away, flannel man!</i>

01:57.083 --> 01:59.784
<i>Back away, flannel man!</i>
<i>Back away, flannel man!</i>

03:08.788 --> 03:11.422
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

03:14.593 --> 03:18.462
I made the car alarm
a little less sensitive.
Only big flies set it off.

03:18.463 --> 03:20.464
What's going on?

03:20.465 --> 03:22.433
It's the <i>cooking with irma</i>
audience.

03:22.434 --> 03:24.769
They're
starting a little early.
You wanna give me a hand?

03:24.770 --> 03:26.437
No one told me about this.

03:26.438 --> 03:29.240
They're bringing in
the set, pronto.

03:34.914 --> 03:37.148
Hey, irma.
Oh! Hi, guys!

03:37.149 --> 03:39.250
Hi. What's cookin'?

03:39.251 --> 03:41.820
I'm making up a batch
of my ratatouille.

03:41.821 --> 03:44.522
Really?
Hmm.

03:44.523 --> 03:46.191
How many parts rat,

03:46.192 --> 03:48.259
How many parts...
<i>(imitates irma)</i>
..."tatouille"?

03:48.260 --> 03:51.429
Oh, timothy, I just love
your delightful insouciance.

03:51.430 --> 03:54.699
Al, would you like a taste?
I thought you would never ask.

03:57.602 --> 03:59.204
You bake this, irma?

04:00.940 --> 04:02.673
Ooh, boy!

04:02.674 --> 04:06.811
Do I detect a hint of tarragon
and a soupçon of oregano?

04:06.812 --> 04:08.947
Oh, very good, al.

04:08.948 --> 04:11.950
Well, I use that
in my own ratatouille.

04:11.951 --> 04:15.320
You gals have so much
in common.

04:15.321 --> 04:18.356
I have just had
some wonderful news.

04:18.357 --> 04:20.358
I just found out
that my daughter

04:20.358 --> 04:23.527
Has had
a beautiful baby girl!

04:23.528 --> 04:25.596
Congratulations.
Congratulations, irma.

04:25.597 --> 04:27.732
I can't believe
that my sweet radish

04:27.733 --> 04:30.335
Has a little cabbage
of her own.

04:30.336 --> 04:32.636
Where was the cabbage delivered,
in salad bar?

04:32.637 --> 04:36.040
Oh, timothy,
you are incorrigible.

04:36.041 --> 04:38.776
Anyway, I'm gonna be gone
until next Sunday,

04:38.777 --> 04:41.779
And I was wondering
if I could impose on you

04:41.780 --> 04:44.782
To... Fill in for me.

04:44.783 --> 04:47.818
You know, be irma
for a week.

04:49.188 --> 04:51.822
Irma for a week?!
I don't know.

04:51.823 --> 04:54.125
Come on, tim.
Irma needs our help.

04:54.126 --> 04:56.560
Her radish
just had a cabbage.

04:58.230 --> 05:00.932
Well, when you
put it like that, al...

05:00.933 --> 05:02.800
Hmm... I could host it.

05:02.801 --> 05:05.036
We could have that
spam casserole.
Al could assist me.

05:05.037 --> 05:07.071
Oh, well,
as a matter of fact,

05:07.072 --> 05:09.374
Since al
is such a wonderful cook,

05:09.375 --> 05:11.376
I was hoping that
he would host it

05:11.377 --> 05:14.812
And that you would
assist him.

05:16.181 --> 05:18.016
Uh... I don't...

05:18.017 --> 05:20.385
I really don't think al
would be comfortable with that.

05:20.386 --> 05:22.820
I would love
the opportunity.

05:22.821 --> 05:25.256
In fact, you might say
I would relish it.

05:25.257 --> 05:28.092
"relish"? Oh, al!

05:28.093 --> 05:31.262
I just admire
your <i>joie de vivre.</i>

05:31.263 --> 05:34.365
That's french for
"big butt crack," isn't it?

05:40.305 --> 05:42.006
Hey, mom.
Hey, mom.

05:42.007 --> 05:43.808
Hi, kids.
How was school?

05:43.809 --> 05:46.411
Great. We got
our class pictures back.

05:46.412 --> 05:49.213
Good. Let me see.
Where are you?

05:49.214 --> 05:51.115
Third one from the right.

05:51.116 --> 05:53.985
You're a little asian girl?

05:53.986 --> 05:55.153
I meant the left.

05:55.154 --> 05:57.989
Oh, you look so cute!

05:57.990 --> 06:01.792
Thanks, mommy.
You look great.
Randy, let me see yours.

06:01.793 --> 06:03.794
I look like
a total dork.

06:03.795 --> 06:07.098
Yeah, right. Let me see it.
Where are you?
There.

06:10.735 --> 06:13.571
You look very cute,
for somebody who's looking
at the girl next to him

06:13.572 --> 06:15.974
With his tongue hanging out.

06:17.943 --> 06:19.944
Yep. Her name's beth.

06:19.945 --> 06:22.447
Jeremy said I should
ask her to go steady.

06:22.448 --> 06:27.618
Really? Does she feel
the same way about you?

06:27.619 --> 06:29.988
I don't know.
I've never talked to her.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.224
Well, then asking her
to go steady

06:33.225 --> 06:35.426
May be a bit of a leap.

06:37.529 --> 06:39.663
What should I say to her?

06:39.664 --> 06:43.701
You could say something
like... "hello."

06:43.702 --> 06:46.704
Yeah. "hello."

06:46.705 --> 06:49.107
That's good.

06:49.108 --> 06:51.376
"hello, beth." no.

06:51.377 --> 06:54.145
Maybe, "hi, beth."

06:54.146 --> 06:58.416
Or maybe "hi" and no "beth."
she knows who she is, right?

06:58.417 --> 07:00.551
Right?
Right.

07:00.552 --> 07:03.587
Will you relax.
Sit down.

07:03.588 --> 07:05.656
Pretend that I'm beth.
You know, just talk to me.

07:07.626 --> 07:09.627
I don't know
what to say.

07:09.628 --> 07:11.062
Tell me I'm pretty.

07:11.063 --> 07:13.364
Are you mom or beth?

07:19.671 --> 07:21.705
<i>(sternly)</i> does it matter?

07:25.110 --> 07:27.245
You're pretty, beth.

07:27.246 --> 07:29.247
And mom.

07:37.523 --> 07:41.025
<i>(imitates julia child)</i>
I'm ready for my cooking debut.

07:41.026 --> 07:44.195
Al, something smells
wonderful back here.

07:45.931 --> 07:47.932
Goodness, it's me!

07:47.933 --> 07:49.867
Tim, the show
is about to begin.

07:49.868 --> 07:52.570
Are you wearing an apron?
Brought one from home.

07:56.141 --> 07:58.443
Does everybody know
who's in the kitchen?

07:58.444 --> 08:00.945
Irma!
That's right,
it's <i>cooking with irma...</i>

08:00.946 --> 08:03.981
With special guest chef
al borland!

08:03.982 --> 08:06.484
<i>(applause)</i>

08:11.490 --> 08:13.924
<i>(musical flourish)</i>
<i>thank you, klaus.</i>

08:13.925 --> 08:15.826
Thank you, heidi.

08:15.827 --> 08:18.329
That's right,
I'm al "the food man" borland.

08:18.330 --> 08:23.401
You all know my assistant
tim "doesn't know gumbo
from dumbo" taylor.

08:27.106 --> 08:30.874
Not so. Dumbo,
of course, is a pachyderm.

08:30.875 --> 08:33.777
Gumbo is a flexible green guy
that rides pokey.

08:40.352 --> 08:44.522
Ok, well, today,
we are cooking cajun style,

08:44.523 --> 08:46.591
And that means gumbo.

08:46.592 --> 08:49.927
Now, one of the most important
ingredients in gumbo is...

08:49.928 --> 08:52.130
Gum. Lots of gum.

08:52.131 --> 08:54.132
Just take it off
the bottom of tables and...

08:54.133 --> 08:57.535
Tim. That would be okra.

08:57.536 --> 09:01.272
Okra! From the great state
of okra-homa.

09:05.010 --> 09:08.912
That's a joke.
Half state, half vegetable.

09:08.913 --> 09:11.315
Like arkan-slaw.

09:14.019 --> 09:17.455
There's no sense making jokes
about food, is there?

09:17.456 --> 09:18.989
Now... Ha-ha!

09:18.990 --> 09:21.859
The wonderful thing
about gumbo is that,

09:21.860 --> 09:26.631
In addition to your vegetables
and your spices,

09:26.632 --> 09:29.600
You can throw
just about anything
into the pot.

09:33.305 --> 09:38.042
You know, if we put
al's mom in the pot,
we'd have jumbo gumbo.

09:41.980 --> 09:47.051
You'd have to know al's mom
to get that joke.

09:47.052 --> 09:50.588
She's a large,
angry woman.

09:50.589 --> 09:53.291
Like so many of you
out there today.

09:56.595 --> 09:59.297
All right, well...

09:59.298 --> 10:02.433
Getting back
to our cajun cooking,

10:02.434 --> 10:06.170
Do you think that
they call it cajun cooking
because you cook it in a cage?

10:10.942 --> 10:13.511
Oh, come on!

10:13.512 --> 10:16.280
You thought that was funny,
but you didn't like
"okra-homa"?

10:19.017 --> 10:22.886
Why don't you be a big help
and take the tops
off those peppers?

10:22.887 --> 10:27.057
Now, cajun cooking
is distinguished by using
a lot of very hot peppers,

10:27.058 --> 10:29.260
And, um...

10:29.261 --> 10:30.928
<i>(tim yells)</i>

10:30.929 --> 10:32.930
As tim has just
demonstrated here,

10:32.931 --> 10:34.898
If you happen
to bite into a pepper,

10:34.899 --> 10:38.302
You wanna drink
plenty of milk,
never water.

10:38.303 --> 10:40.003
<i>(yells)</i>

10:40.004 --> 10:42.005
Water will only
make it worse.

10:42.006 --> 10:44.041
Or you can bite into
a piece of bread.

10:47.112 --> 10:49.480
But not
jalapeño bread.

10:55.420 --> 10:58.922
Good night, mrs. Mcdowell.
Thank you for coming,
mrs. Yost.

10:58.923 --> 11:01.325
Remember the weather report
from the kitchen -

11:01.326 --> 11:03.361
"chili today,
hot tamale."

11:08.467 --> 11:10.234
Hey!

11:10.235 --> 11:12.770
They loved me!
They hated me.

11:12.771 --> 11:15.038
Well, you started off
a little rocky,

11:15.039 --> 11:17.040
But once you were in
too much pain to talk,

11:17.041 --> 11:20.278
Boy, the show
really took off.

11:20.279 --> 11:22.846
I'm gonna take off. I don't
wanna do this tomorrow.

11:22.847 --> 11:25.349
What are you talking about?
Come on.

11:25.350 --> 11:28.586
You don't need me here.
You cook well enough
by yourself. I'm just a burden.

11:28.587 --> 11:30.488
How many guys does it take
to lift a radish?

11:30.489 --> 11:32.823
Now come on.
We promised irma.

11:32.824 --> 11:37.528
Besides, tomorrow,
I'm cooking with poultry,
and I'm gonna need some help.

11:37.529 --> 11:40.864
Why don't you get
one of your blue-haired groupies
to help you out?

11:40.865 --> 11:44.168
I get it. I see what it is.

11:44.169 --> 11:47.938
You're just jealous
because now I'm the star.

11:47.939 --> 11:51.008
The star?
You're guest hosting
a cable cooking show.

11:51.009 --> 11:53.577
Yeah, well, I know why
you're backing out.

11:53.578 --> 11:57.715
It's
just because you're not
the center of attention.

11:57.716 --> 12:01.652
I just don't like
being your dopey sidekick.
You know how demeaning that is?

12:07.793 --> 12:10.060
Don't look at me like that.
This is not like <i>tool time.</i>

12:10.061 --> 12:12.095
No, it's not like
<i>tool time,</i>

12:12.096 --> 12:14.565
Because you're the star,
and I'm the dopey sidekick!

12:14.566 --> 12:17.368
I've never used the word
"sidekick."

12:25.644 --> 12:28.746
Hey, randy,
wait till you hear this.

12:28.747 --> 12:32.550
I talked to ashley, and beth
is mildly interested in you.

12:32.551 --> 12:35.453
All right,
she's mildly interested!

12:35.454 --> 12:37.788
They're coming over after school
to hang together.

12:37.789 --> 12:40.624
If she likes you,
she's gonna give ashley the nod.

12:40.625 --> 12:43.093
"the nod"?
You remember the nod.

12:44.763 --> 12:47.398
Oh, right. The nod.

12:51.269 --> 12:53.637
Do you guys know
how stupid you look?

12:57.642 --> 12:59.643
I can't believe
beth's coming here.

12:59.644 --> 13:01.545
What if I don't have
anything to say to her?

13:01.546 --> 13:05.883
Sit there and talk about
yourself the whole time.
Women love that.

13:05.884 --> 13:08.986
I'm surprised
you didn't tell him
to burp for beth.

13:08.987 --> 13:11.989
You gotta save something
for the second date.

13:11.990 --> 13:14.792
<i>(chuckles)</i>

13:14.793 --> 13:17.261
What's cookin'?
It's gumbo.

13:17.262 --> 13:19.764
Ohh...
Al's recipe.

13:19.765 --> 13:21.965
But, of course, I added
a few things of my own.

13:21.966 --> 13:24.435
I thought al was really good
on that show today.

13:24.436 --> 13:27.738
What did you think of me?

13:27.739 --> 13:30.775
Well, for a guy
who doesn't know anything
about cooking,

13:30.776 --> 13:32.810
I thought you came across

13:32.811 --> 13:35.312
As a guy who doesn't know
anything about cooking.

13:35.313 --> 13:37.882
That's why I'm not
doing it anymore.
Makes sense.

13:37.883 --> 13:41.419
Al thinks it's 'cause
I can't stand not being
the center of attention.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.054
That makes more sense.

13:44.055 --> 13:47.357
I don't always have to be
the center of attention.

13:47.358 --> 13:50.694
Our wedding -
I let you walk down
the aisle by yourself.

13:50.695 --> 13:54.097
While you were
making shadow puppets
on the pulpit!

13:55.667 --> 13:58.602
Can I have some salt,
please?

13:59.871 --> 14:01.872
This is your problem, tim.

14:01.873 --> 14:05.342
You cannot be in front
of a group of people without
being the center of attention.

14:05.343 --> 14:08.679
That's what you did
on al's show today.
I need pepper - cayenne.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.148
I just can't help it.

14:11.149 --> 14:14.452
You know how hard it is for me
to stand in front of people
and not make 'em laugh?

14:14.453 --> 14:18.155
You did a pretty
darn good job
of that today.

14:18.156 --> 14:19.890
"okra-homa"?

14:19.891 --> 14:22.460
"arkan-slaw" was funny.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.528
Hand me that celery.

14:24.529 --> 14:27.297
I'm just not cut out
to be somebody's assistant.

14:31.402 --> 14:35.405
You have been assisting me
this whole time
making the gumbo.

14:35.406 --> 14:37.575
Oh. I could do that.

14:37.576 --> 14:41.211
Look, all you gotta do
is do your homework.

14:41.212 --> 14:44.582
Then when you
go and help al tomorrow,
you'll be in better shape.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.985
I will sit down,
and I will tell you everything
that I know about cooking.

14:47.986 --> 14:49.152
Ok.

14:55.694 --> 14:57.695
Maybe I'd better
get a cookbook.

15:14.846 --> 15:16.847
This is very good lemonade.

15:16.848 --> 15:19.884
Thanks. My mom made it.

15:19.885 --> 15:23.186
You know, beth, randy's
a really funny guy.

15:23.187 --> 15:26.056
Really? I like
funny people.

15:26.057 --> 15:29.760
Yeah, randy,
say something funny.

15:36.401 --> 15:37.501
Uh...

15:38.503 --> 15:40.404
Ok.

15:40.405 --> 15:42.205
I got a joke.

15:43.642 --> 15:46.944
What do you call
bad lemonade?

15:46.945 --> 15:47.978
What?

15:47.979 --> 15:49.947
Lemon lemonade.

15:53.151 --> 15:56.687
<i>(forced laughter)</i>

15:56.688 --> 15:58.455
I don't get it.

15:58.456 --> 16:02.259
That's the last time
I use one of dad's joke.

16:05.030 --> 16:08.365
Would anybody like
a homemade sugar cookie?

16:08.366 --> 16:10.467
<i>(beth)</i> yeah.
<i>(brad)</i> I would, please.

16:10.468 --> 16:12.502
Are you enjoying
the lemonade?

16:12.503 --> 16:14.572
Yes, it's great,
thank you.

16:14.573 --> 16:18.075
Beth, I think
I met your parents
at back-to-school night.

16:18.076 --> 16:20.143
Your mother is the, um...

16:20.144 --> 16:22.145
Aerobics instructor.

16:22.146 --> 16:25.983
Oh... Yeah. I remember her.

16:28.219 --> 16:30.621
These are really great
sugar cookies.

16:30.622 --> 16:34.758
My mom doesn't
keep sweets in our house.
She says they make you fat.

16:44.569 --> 16:48.338
Well, if you guys
need me...

16:48.339 --> 16:51.041
I'll be upstairs
doing stomach crunches.

16:56.414 --> 17:00.117
Beth, another
cooker snoogie?

17:00.118 --> 17:03.420
I-I mean,
a booger cookie?

17:06.156 --> 17:08.826
Is it hot in here?

17:12.696 --> 17:14.364
I'll be right back.

17:21.172 --> 17:25.709
<i>(sighs)</i> oh, man.
I am such a dork.

17:29.213 --> 17:32.683
Experiencing some
adolescent angst,
preteen taylor?

17:34.385 --> 17:37.154
Oh... Sorry, wilson.

17:37.155 --> 17:38.455
Mm-hmm.

17:38.456 --> 17:41.792
I just made a jerk of myself
in front of a girl.

17:41.793 --> 17:46.196
Well, randy taylor,
welcome to the tribe of men.

17:46.197 --> 17:48.799
I mean, I don't get it.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.235
I really like beth,
but ever since she got here,

17:52.236 --> 17:54.604
I've been saying
really dumb things.

17:54.605 --> 17:58.441
Randy, probably that's
because you're sailing
in unfamiliar waters.

17:58.442 --> 18:02.412
I'm sure the first time
romeo met a girl, he probably
said some dumb things, too.

18:02.413 --> 18:04.648
Hello?

18:04.649 --> 18:05.716
Right here.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.551
Oh.

18:07.552 --> 18:11.521
Did romeo ask juliet
if she wanted a "booger cookie"?

18:13.024 --> 18:15.625
Mm... Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm, mmm.

18:15.626 --> 18:18.762
Now, that is a gaffe
and a half. Heh-heh.

18:18.763 --> 18:21.198
Yeah.

18:21.199 --> 18:26.203
I mean, maybe I'm not cut out
for this romance stuff.

18:26.204 --> 18:28.605
<i>(laughs)</i> well, randy,

18:28.606 --> 18:31.608
When it comes to winning
the affections of a young lady,

18:31.609 --> 18:34.945
You might heed the advice
of thomas herrick.

18:34.946 --> 18:38.115
What'd he say, wilson?

18:38.116 --> 18:41.451
He said, "to get thine ends,
lay bashfulness aside.

18:41.452 --> 18:46.156
He that fears to ask
doth be denied."

18:46.157 --> 18:49.593
So what you're saying is,
"no guts, no glory."

18:49.594 --> 18:52.162
Very good, young taylor.

18:52.163 --> 18:55.232
You know, there are those
among us who wouldn't have
picked it up that quickly.

18:57.769 --> 19:00.003
So I gotta keep trying, huh?

19:00.004 --> 19:02.106
You may not
have to try too hard.

19:02.107 --> 19:04.541
I think the lady's
equally smitten with you.

19:04.542 --> 19:06.676
What makes you say that?

19:06.677 --> 19:09.079
Because ever since
you came out back,

19:09.080 --> 19:11.949
She's been
staring at you.

19:13.752 --> 19:17.121
Oh. Thanks, wilson.
<i>(chuckles)</i>

19:17.122 --> 19:21.691
Hey, what were the first words
you said to a girl
you had a crush on?

19:21.692 --> 19:24.694
I believe they were,
"hidey-ho, good-lookin'."

19:28.967 --> 19:31.068
Thanks, wilson.

19:31.069 --> 19:34.638
As we all know, the french
are the masters of the kitchen.

19:34.639 --> 19:38.142
Nothing says <i>"bonjour"</i>
better than duck.

19:38.143 --> 19:43.213
Now, the first thing
I'm going to be needing here
is a large roasting pan.

19:43.214 --> 19:45.515
It's over here.
Where did I...?

19:45.516 --> 19:49.253
Thank you. I didn't think
you were joining me
in the kitchen today.

19:49.254 --> 19:53.056
I'm your assistant.
Where else would I be?

19:53.057 --> 19:55.458
Well, great. Thank you.

19:55.459 --> 19:58.328
Ok, well. Shall we begin
by explaining

19:58.329 --> 20:00.463
How we're going
to dress our duck?

20:00.464 --> 20:02.465
How do you dress a duck?

20:02.466 --> 20:04.567
If it's formal,
coat and tie.

20:06.704 --> 20:09.439
Now, once I get finished
stuffing the duck,

20:09.440 --> 20:11.641
I will be closing it up.

20:11.642 --> 20:15.179
And for that,
I think you'll be using
a poultry lacer.

20:15.180 --> 20:18.215
Actually, tim,
I was thinking of using
some "duck" tape.

20:24.755 --> 20:26.756
I don't think so, al.

20:32.864 --> 20:39.036
Tim, you wanna double check
to see if I've preheated
our oven to 350 degrees?

20:39.037 --> 20:42.605
Ok. I also read that you
shouldn't overstuff your duck
'cause it gets in there...

20:42.606 --> 20:45.275
Tim, I think I know
what I'm doing.

20:45.276 --> 20:47.911
I'm just saying...
That's fine.

20:49.314 --> 20:51.715
350 on the dot.

20:51.716 --> 20:56.153
We've also moved our rack
to the top level so that bird
will come out nice and crispy.

20:56.154 --> 20:59.522
Voilà. Ok, we're all ready
for the duck.

20:59.523 --> 21:02.292
Ok.

21:02.293 --> 21:05.996
Get it before
the heat goes out.

21:05.997 --> 21:08.332
Yeah. I just...
Just making sure that
that is stuffed in there.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.334
You want me
to give you a hand?

21:10.335 --> 21:12.336
I think I know
what I'm doing, tim.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.990
What al's done here
is actually develop
a new recipe.

21:32.991 --> 21:37.094
You've heard of
pheasant under glass.

21:37.095 --> 21:39.629
This would be
quacker through the glass.

21:43.401 --> 21:46.303
<i>Join us tomorrow</i>
<i>for our salute...</i>

21:46.304 --> 21:47.504
<i>(cow moos)</i>

21:47.505 --> 21:49.273
<i>...To beef.</i>

21:50.541 --> 21:54.177
<i>(♪ theme song)</i>

21:54.178 --> 21:55.279
<i>(turns off tv)</i>

21:55.280 --> 21:58.181
Well, tim,
I'm very impressed.

21:58.182 --> 22:00.350
See what a great
second banana you were?

22:00.351 --> 22:03.453
It would have been a tragedy
had that second banana split.

22:05.990 --> 22:08.292
It's 5:30. I wonder
where randy is.

22:08.293 --> 22:11.494
He's probably with beth,
getting more nods.

22:12.797 --> 22:15.365
Like father, like son,
you know.

22:15.366 --> 22:17.434
What do you mean
by that?

22:17.435 --> 22:19.769
If you recall,
on our first date,
you gave me the nod.

22:19.770 --> 22:22.772
Yeah, that was
all you got.

22:22.773 --> 22:24.908
I'm home!

22:24.909 --> 22:26.977
Hey, killer.
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

22:28.246 --> 22:30.880
How'd it go?

22:30.881 --> 22:34.517
Well... We're past
the nod stage.

22:34.518 --> 22:37.154
What?
She gave me a kiss.

22:38.689 --> 22:41.391
What?!
Mom.

22:41.392 --> 22:44.627
What would you have done
if I'd kissed you
on the first date?

22:44.628 --> 22:46.396
Would've woken up.

22:53.004 --> 22:55.072
Hi! Tim "the tool man"
taylor.

22:55.073 --> 22:58.241
You all know my assistant
al... Oh.

23:01.045 --> 23:03.380
We got that
out of the way.

23:03.381 --> 23:05.949
Cut. Pick it up.

23:05.950 --> 23:07.951
I see what it is.

23:07.952 --> 23:11.654
You're just jealous
because now I'm the star.

23:11.655 --> 23:13.957
Oh, back the bread basket up,
buddy.

23:13.958 --> 23:17.327
You're just substitute host
for a cable cooking show.
