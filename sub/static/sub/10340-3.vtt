WEBVTT

02:33.069 --> 02:37.156
No, no. No, not in my room,
in here. In here.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.116
Jerry, back from Paris?

02:39.284 --> 02:42.744
Ben, what a nightmare.
Right there, no, no, right there.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.580
What is with you guys?

02:44.747 --> 02:47.749
I've got a sandwich in there,
I want all those bags opened.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.043
We're looking until we find it.

02:50.211 --> 02:54.339
Hey, Audrey, Uncle Jerry's back.
Heh.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.092
- Sylvia.
- Benjamin.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.514
Okay, okay. Go on. Goodbye.

03:04.934 --> 03:09.897
Brother Ben, this is the best
damn sandwich I ever ate.

03:10.064 --> 03:12.399
It's a baguette, with Brie and butter.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.569
I had four of these damn things
every day I was there.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.945
You got to try this thing.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.533
Here, go ahead, eat it, go ahead.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.118
Go ahead.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.454
Oh, yeah.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.378
Mm.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.007
Mm. Mm!

03:39.344 --> 03:42.721
Mm! This is incredible, Jer.

03:46.684 --> 03:49.686
You know what this reminds us of?
You know who likes this?

03:51.147 --> 03:54.399
It reminds us of Ginny and Jenny's
down by the river.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.487
- Hmm?
- By God, you're right.

03:58.655 --> 04:02.241
Am I right? Am I right? Hmm?

04:02.408 --> 04:04.034
Oh, no wonder.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.792
Mm. Mm!

04:12.001 --> 04:13.961
Mm. Jer.

04:14.128 --> 04:17.297
Outside, outside, outside.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.925
Mm. Oh.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.637
Always a pleasure.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.893
Mm. Incredible. Incredible.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.608
- Mm.
- Jer.

04:40.989 --> 04:44.783
Leland's daughter was murdered
and the Norwegians left.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.619
Did they sign?

04:47.787 --> 04:49.496
Deal's off.

04:50.164 --> 04:51.873
Oh!

04:56.421 --> 05:00.507
We had those Vikings by the horns,
what happened?

05:00.675 --> 05:04.177
We're not a hundred percent sure,
they took their translator with them.

05:07.724 --> 05:11.059
Did you say Leland's daughter
was murdered?

05:11.853 --> 05:13.145
Yes.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.650
Ugh, I'm depressed.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.155
I can fix that.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.075
There's a new girl
at One-Eyed Jack's.

05:27.243 --> 05:30.704
Freshly scented
from the perfume counter.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.831
And you, brother Jer,

05:32.999 --> 05:37.377
have a 50-50 chance
of being first in line.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.923
I like those odds.

05:43.301 --> 05:47.971
All work and no play
make Ben and Jerry dull boys.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.973
That's right.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.392
Let's jump in the boat.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.622
That's great huckleberry pie,
Mrs. Hayward.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.956
Thank you, James.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.417
Well...

06:17.960 --> 06:21.004
Mrs. Hayward and I
are gonna say good night, James.

06:21.422 --> 06:22.589
Good night, James.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.132
Good night.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.927
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Mom.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.888
Uh, don't worry about the dishes.
I'll clean up.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.186
Are you, uh, coming to church
with us in the morning, Donna?

06:36.354 --> 06:37.687
Yes.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.818
- Nine o'clock sharp.
- Okay.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.198
- Good night, James.
- Good night, sir.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.174
Hi, sailor.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.219
Good evening, Mr. Horne.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.596
Ah, heh-heh.

07:13.182 --> 07:16.393
Now, Ben, we're not gonna go
in the casino first, are we?

07:16.561 --> 07:21.064
Jer, I didn't come here to lose my shirt,
I just came to take it off.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.274
Yeah.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.694
- Kim, the Horne brothers are here.
- I'll tell Blackie.

07:37.373 --> 07:40.125
Sweetheart, I'd like to order two drinks.

07:40.626 --> 07:44.880
One double Scotch on the rocks
and my brother would like

07:45.047 --> 07:47.132
a double Scotch on the rocks.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.510
That's two double
Scotch on the rocks.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.722
Next stop, rocket science.

07:53.890 --> 07:54.973
Jerry.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.401
Ah.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.114
- Blackie.
- Benjamin.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.575
Mm.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.995
Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.456
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate

08:19.624 --> 08:22.709
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

08:22.877 --> 08:26.087
And every fair from fair
sometimes declines,

08:26.255 --> 08:29.424
By chance or nature's
changing course untrimmed

08:29.592 --> 08:32.552
But thy eternal summer
shall not fade,

08:32.720 --> 08:36.014
Nor lose possession
of that fair thou ow'st,

08:36.182 --> 08:38.475
- Nor shall death brag...
- Where's the new girl?

08:41.896 --> 08:44.105
When you really want love,

08:44.899 --> 08:46.650
you'll find it waiting for you.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.784
Heads.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.829
Ah.

09:50.965 --> 09:54.217
Come on.
We'll take care of you, Jerry.

09:57.179 --> 09:58.221
Well...

10:04.979 --> 10:06.021
Donna, I don't think

10:06.188 --> 10:10.108
that what we're feeling or doing
is wrong.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.944
Why not?

10:14.363 --> 10:16.323
Because it's the truth.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.409
Because I think it would have
turned out this way anyway.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.828
You do?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.039
Yes.

10:24.206 --> 10:28.668
I remember a time in school,
in the hall,

10:28.836 --> 10:32.797
we were suddenly alone
and we looked at each other.

10:35.217 --> 10:38.053
I almost told you I loved you then.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.974
It's true.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.268
It is true, isn't it?

10:48.230 --> 10:50.231
Oh, James.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.776
I guess because of Laura
I couldn't say anything.

10:52.943 --> 10:56.571
- I couldn't even let myself think it.
- Me too.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.870
Are we gonna be together, James?

11:05.247 --> 11:07.165
Are we?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.965
Are we, James?

11:45.579 --> 11:46.621
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

11:46.789 --> 11:47.956
Hello, it's Hawk.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.709
Deputy Hawk,
how is Ronette Pulaski?

11:50.876 --> 11:53.128
Body and spirit are still far apart.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.088
What did you find out
from her parents?

11:55.256 --> 11:56.423
Ronette recently quit her job

11:56.590 --> 11:59.008
at the perfume counter
of Horne's department store.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.052
Everything else is quiet,
except this afternoon

12:01.220 --> 12:04.848
there was a one-armed man
snooping around intensive care.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.933
A one-armed man?

12:07.101 --> 12:08.309
Left.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.019
Did you question him?

12:10.187 --> 12:13.481
Negative.
I pursued but he got away.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.900
Maintain an around-the-clock watch
on Ronette

12:16.068 --> 12:17.777
and we'll speak in the morning.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.286
You got it?

13:54.416 --> 13:57.585
Supposed to leave it
in this stupid football.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.964
Is it in there?

14:01.924 --> 14:03.591
Not all of it.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.054
Cash on delivery, Bobby.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.605
He's got a gun.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.404
- Hey, Leo.
- Hey.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.701
Who's that?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.746
Is there someone with you?

14:33.914 --> 14:36.958
Never mind.
Toss it over here, quarterback.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.090
- It's empty.
- Is that right?

14:44.258 --> 14:46.634
Weren't you supposed to leave
something in there for me?

14:46.802 --> 14:49.053
This barely covers
what we paid for.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.307
- Where's the rest?
- Where's the rest of the money?

14:52.474 --> 14:55.268
There's a... There's a problem.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.937
Problem?

14:58.105 --> 15:00.899
Laura had the other half,
in a safe deposit box.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.650
You think you got problems?

15:03.193 --> 15:06.029
We can get it, Leo. Just wait
till everything settles down.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.531
You punks owe me 10 grand.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.660
Leo needs a new pair of shoes.

15:13.537 --> 15:14.996
Okay.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.416
We won't take delivery on the drugs
until you get the cash.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.168
Do I look like a bank?

15:20.336 --> 15:22.295
I appreciate your position.

15:22.463 --> 15:25.506
But this thing with Laura,
how can I anticipate that kind of thing?

15:25.674 --> 15:27.884
Hey, man, Laura was a wild girl.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.511
Tell me about it.

15:30.679 --> 15:33.556
Maybe. Someday.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.768
Take your hand out of your pocket,
Mike.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.771
What is your problem, Leo?

15:40.689 --> 15:42.190
Problem?

15:42.566 --> 15:44.859
You want to know about problems?

15:45.527 --> 15:46.945
Okay.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.197
You're on the road.

15:49.531 --> 15:52.325
Driving back and forth.
Gone for days.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.910
You get back and guess what?

15:55.371 --> 15:56.412
What?

15:56.580 --> 15:59.415
You find out your old lady's
been giving it away.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.418
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.505
Stepping out in your own
damn bedroom.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.756
That's a problem.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.384
I guess so.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.344
I guess it is.

16:12.930 --> 16:16.224
- Do you know who?
- A man needs a clean house.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.600
Sure, yeah.

16:17.768 --> 16:18.810
So do you know who?

16:21.897 --> 16:23.147
I'll take care of it.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.357
Sure you will, man.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.359
This other thing, hell,
we'll take care of that,

16:26.527 --> 16:27.902
don't you worry about that.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.988
We'll get the cash
and everything will be square.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.124
Go out for a pass.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.583
What?

16:44.336 --> 16:46.921
- Go out for a pass.
- Okay.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.506
- Just...
- Run.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.049
- Just take it easy.
- Run!

16:50.217 --> 16:51.342
- Take it easy.
- Easy.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.802
- Run!
- Take it easy.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.446
Damn it. I'm done, Bobby.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.948
Let's get the hell out of here.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.733
- Ed.
- I'm sorry, honey, I didn't see it there.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.902
You stepped on my drape runner.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.279
Well, honey, it was right out
in the middle of the floor.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.073
You think that's an accident?

17:55.240 --> 17:57.033
I laid those out there myself.

17:57.201 --> 18:00.286
I was up all night working
on that invention.

18:00.454 --> 18:05.750
I'm going to have the world's first
100 percent quiet runner.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.503
I'm real sorry, Nadine.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.755
Ed, you make me sick.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.037
That's it.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.457
Exactly 60 feet, six inches.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.334
It's perfect.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.462
What do you think he's up to?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.133
It beats me.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.555
Invitation to love.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.724
Each day brings a new beginning.

19:03.892 --> 19:09.772
And every hour holds the promise
of an Invitation to Love.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.151
Right.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.157
Who is it?

19:19.324 --> 19:20.950
Hey, baby, it's the big bad bobcat.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.077
Are you crazy?
What are you doing here?

19:23.245 --> 19:26.164
I just passed Leo, he started
to diesel up out in North Bend.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.457
- We got at least 20 minutes.
- Oh, God.

19:28.625 --> 19:29.709
Where's your car?

19:29.877 --> 19:31.043
Parked in the woods, come on.

19:31.211 --> 19:34.964
Open sesame. Somebody might
see me out here and that'd be worse.

19:38.343 --> 19:41.846
Bobby, you cannot come by here
like this.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.891
We can't see each other for a while.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.442
What the hell happened to you?

19:57.738 --> 20:00.198
Leo Johnson happened to me.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.367
That bastard.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.744
Come here.

20:04.912 --> 20:09.081
Bobby, if he finds out about us,
he's gonna kill you.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.667
He'll kill us both.

20:17.758 --> 20:24.388
If he ever does this to you again,
I'll kill him.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.892
I mean it.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.479
Bobby.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.164
Cup of coffee.

21:06.181 --> 21:10.184
It's not the first time,
it won't be the last,

21:10.352 --> 21:13.020
but I'm in that doghouse again.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.273
What happened this time?

21:15.607 --> 21:17.191
Well, I popped a grease gun,

21:17.359 --> 21:20.611
stepped on a drape runner
and all hell broke loose.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.321
I ran into Nadine
in the hardware store.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.241
That's all she talked about
were those drape runners.

21:26.618 --> 21:29.662
She's got one big bee in her bonnet.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.460
Young Bobby sure gave me
a good one didn't he?

21:37.004 --> 21:39.046
Where do you want these rocks?

21:39.214 --> 21:41.215
Put them right down there
by the doughnuts, deputy.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.967
Anyone for a warm-up?

21:43.135 --> 21:45.678
- Yes.
- You bet. You bet.

21:46.054 --> 21:47.847
- Right over here.
- Thanks, Lucy.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.352
Damn good coffee.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.146
And hot.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.691
Would everyone please take a seat?

22:01.862 --> 22:03.279
Ah.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.665
By way of explaining
what we're about to do,

22:14.833 --> 22:16.792
I am first going to tell you a little bit

22:16.960 --> 22:20.504
about the country called

22:20.881 --> 22:22.340
Tibet.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.304
An extremely spiritual country,

22:28.472 --> 22:31.682
for centuries the leader of Tibet
has been known as the Dalai Lama.

22:31.850 --> 22:36.020
In 1950, Communist China
invaded Tibet

22:36.188 --> 22:38.481
and while leaving
the Dalai Lama nominally in charge,

22:38.648 --> 22:40.941
they in fact seized control
of the entire country.

22:41.109 --> 22:44.028
In 1959, after a Tibetan uprising
against the Chinese,

22:44.196 --> 22:46.113
the Dalai Lama was forced
to flee to India

22:46.281 --> 22:48.532
for his life and has lived
in exile ever since.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.328
Following a dream
I had three years ago,

22:52.496 --> 22:55.206
I have become deeply moved
by the plight of the Tibetan people

22:55.374 --> 22:57.875
and filled with a desire to help them.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.628
I also awoke
from the same dream realizing

23:00.796 --> 23:04.090
that I had subconsciously gained
knowledge of a deductive technique,

23:04.257 --> 23:07.134
involving mind-body coordination
operating hand in hand

23:07.302 --> 23:09.011
with the deepest level of intuition.

23:10.972 --> 23:13.933
Sheriff, Deputy Hawk,
if you will please assist me,

23:14.101 --> 23:15.935
I will now demonstrate.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.485
You will recall
on the day of her death

23:24.653 --> 23:27.113
Laura Palmer wrote
the following entry in her diary:

23:27.280 --> 23:29.198
"Nervous about meeting J tonight."

23:29.366 --> 23:32.076
Today, we're going to concentrate
on the J's.

23:36.748 --> 23:40.126
Harry, when I give the word,
would you please read aloud

23:40.293 --> 23:42.378
each of the names
I've written on the blackboard.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.880
- Okey-doke.
- Deputy Hawk, stand over here

23:45.048 --> 23:47.758
and hold this bucket of rocks up
near me where I can get to them.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.094
Would you please
put on the kitchen mittens?

23:50.262 --> 23:52.096
Deputy Andy, move down,

23:52.264 --> 23:53.806
stand by the bottle.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.727
Lucy, take this piece of chalk.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.439
Not too near, Andy.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.483
I'm getting excited.

24:04.651 --> 24:06.610
If I should strike the bottle
after Sheriff Truman

24:06.778 --> 24:09.530
says a particular name, make a check
to the right of that name.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.782
Oh. Sheriff, I almost forgot,
when you say the name,

24:11.950 --> 24:15.327
also briefly state that person's
relationship to Laura Palmer.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.662
Ready?

24:16.830 --> 24:18.038
- Ready.
- Ready.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.798
James Hurley.

24:28.633 --> 24:29.675
Secret boyfriend.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.844
James Hurley.

24:37.142 --> 24:40.269
Josie Packard.
Was instructed in English by Laura.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.730
Josie Packard.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.654
So there's no check
next to either of these names?

24:51.114 --> 24:53.073
That's correct, please continue.

24:53.575 --> 24:57.077
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby,
Laura's psychiatrist.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.955
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.085
You did it, you hit it.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.838
Lucy, make a note
that the bottle was struck

25:08.006 --> 25:09.173
but did not break.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.008
- Very important.
- Okay.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.511
Andy, put that bottle back
exactly where it was.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.140
Johnny Horne.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.601
Laura was
his special education tutor.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.561
Johnny Horne.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.111
Norma Jennings.

25:31.279 --> 25:34.281
She helped Laura organize
the Meals on Wheels program.

25:34.449 --> 25:36.283
Norma Jennings.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.663
Shelly Johnson.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.623
Waitress at diner, friend.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.333
Shelly Johnson.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.716
- Sorry, Andy.
- Sweetie?

25:52.884 --> 25:53.926
It didn't hurt.

25:56.638 --> 25:57.680
It didn't hurt a bit.

25:57.847 --> 26:00.057
Where there's no sense,
there's no feeling, Andy.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.732
Cooper.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.068
Tell me.

26:12.070 --> 26:17.449
The idea for all this
really came from a dream?

26:17.617 --> 26:20.077
Yes. It did.

26:26.876 --> 26:31.463
Uh, Jack with One Eye.

26:31.631 --> 26:36.051
Maybe it's the letter I,
but there's no I in Jack.

26:36.219 --> 26:38.804
I think perhaps it means
he only had one eye, Lucy.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.432
Sounds like, uh, Nadine,
Big Ed Hurley's wife.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.226
No, no, no, there's a casino up north
called One-Eyed Jack's,

26:44.394 --> 26:46.103
across the border
on the Canadian side.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.272
That's it, we're gonna go
and check that place out.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.481
Okay.

26:49.649 --> 26:53.402
Agent Cooper, I'm going to erase this
because it's a place and not a person.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.946
Actually, maybe the person
could be in the place.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.365
- So should I erase it?
- Yes.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.285
Yes, a person could be in a place,
or yes, I should...?

27:01.453 --> 27:04.288
- Lucy.
- Erase it, Lucy.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.581
Next name, Harry.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.833
Leo Johnson.

27:08.001 --> 27:13.005
Husband of Shelly, drives a truck,
connection with Laura...

27:14.174 --> 27:16.967
- Unknown.
- Leo Johnson.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.722
Ah!

27:52.671 --> 27:55.089
Little Audrey Horne just walked in.

27:56.424 --> 28:00.469
Yeah, I saw her at church.
Wonder what she's doing down here.

28:18.279 --> 28:19.697
- Hi, Audrey.
- Hi, Norma.

28:19.864 --> 28:22.783
- Can I have a cup of coffee, please?
- Sure.

28:25.745 --> 28:28.956
Remind me to stop at the hardware
store to get those 60-watt bulbs.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.756
Thanks.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.314
I'm gonna go say hi.

29:03.533 --> 29:04.658
Hi.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.577
Hi, Donna.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.083
So my parents said
they saw you at church today.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.960
I didn't see you.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.423
Yeah, I came by because of Laura.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.801
What do you mean?

29:22.969 --> 29:24.595
I didn't even think you liked her.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.639
There were things about Laura
I didn't like,

29:27.807 --> 29:30.642
but she did help to take care
of my brother Johnny.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.978
Guess I sort of loved her for that.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.661
Do you like coffee?

29:50.747 --> 29:53.791
Yeah. With cream and sugar.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.880
Agent Cooper loves coffee.

30:00.548 --> 30:01.590
Audrey.

30:08.848 --> 30:12.684
But Agent Cooper
likes his coffee black.

30:19.317 --> 30:22.528
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.867
Did Laura ever talk about my father?

30:31.621 --> 30:33.247
What do you mean?

30:35.333 --> 30:36.792
Nothing.

30:37.252 --> 30:39.545
No, what do you mean?

30:43.174 --> 30:45.342
He used to sing to her.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.016
God, I love this music.

30:55.895 --> 30:58.355
Isn't it too dreamy?

31:44.485 --> 31:45.611
Can you believe this?

31:45.778 --> 31:49.448
Hawk found this half mile
down the tracks from the crime site.

31:53.703 --> 31:56.246
Oh, it's a nasty piece of work.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.879
Tell Agent Cooper
that Albert and his team are here.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.798
- Albert?
- A-L-B-E-R-T.

32:06.966 --> 32:09.092
Are we gonna have to
stand here all afternoon?

32:09.260 --> 32:11.803
- No.
- Albert Rosenfield.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.932
R-O-S-E-N-F-l-E-L-D.

32:16.809 --> 32:18.644
Sheriff, this is Lucy.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.187
Is Agent Cooper with you?

32:20.355 --> 32:21.772
Yes, he is.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.316
Are Albert and his team here, Lucy?

32:24.484 --> 32:26.401
Yes, he is. They are.

32:26.569 --> 32:28.111
We're on our way.

32:28.279 --> 32:29.821
Agent Cooper will be right with you.

32:29.989 --> 32:31.990
Yeah, I can hear perfectly well,
Curly.

32:33.868 --> 32:36.703
Harry, Albert and his team
are cream of the crop.

32:36.871 --> 32:38.205
Albert's a forensic genius.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.707
If they're working for you,
I wouldn't expect anything less.

32:40.875 --> 32:45.003
But I got to warn you. Albert's
lacking in some of the social niceties.

32:45.171 --> 32:48.340
- Nobody's perfect.
- Isn't that the truth?

32:56.057 --> 32:57.683
What the hell kind
of a two-bit operation

32:57.850 --> 32:59.559
they running out of this tree house,
Cooper?

32:59.727 --> 33:01.812
Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.022
I have seen
some slipshod backwater burgs,

33:04.190 --> 33:05.482
but this place takes the cake.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.485
What are you waiting for, Christmas?
Got work to do.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.570
They're putting this girl
in the ground tomorrow,

33:10.738 --> 33:13.532
and we've wasted half the day traveling
here to the middle of nowhere.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.201
Well, Albert, I suggest you
and your team should get started.

33:16.369 --> 33:18.787
I'll have one of my men
escort you over to the morgue.

33:18.955 --> 33:19.997
That'd be fine.

33:20.164 --> 33:23.000
Results from
the local pathologist's report.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.671
Welcome to amateur hour.

33:31.092 --> 33:32.884
Looks like an all nighter, boys.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.636
Albert.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.555
Got a minute?

33:40.560 --> 33:43.228
I hear that you're real good
at what you do.

33:43.396 --> 33:45.439
- Yeah, that's correct.
- Well, that's good.

33:45.606 --> 33:49.526
Because normally if a stranger walked
into my station talking this kind of crap,

33:49.694 --> 33:54.072
he'd be looking for his teeth
two blocks up on queer street.

34:13.468 --> 34:15.177
Good night, Ed.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.142
Ed, is that you?

34:22.310 --> 34:24.352
Yeah, honey, it's me.

34:26.564 --> 34:29.941
- Ed!
- Oh, my God.

34:33.988 --> 34:38.283
Oh, Ed, I'm so happy, sweetheart,
I have to thank you.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.618
Why's that?

34:39.786 --> 34:42.204
You don't know
what you've done for me?

34:42.371 --> 34:43.663
No, I don't.

34:43.831 --> 34:46.666
Oh, Ed, you big lug.

34:46.834 --> 34:49.795
When you tracked all
that grease into the house today,

34:49.962 --> 34:53.590
you spilled some on my cotton balls,

34:53.758 --> 34:58.637
but instead of tossing them out,
I put the greased ones on the runners,

34:59.097 --> 35:04.309
and, Ed, just listen to this.

35:12.151 --> 35:15.612
Completely silent.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.614
How about that?

35:17.782 --> 35:19.574
Oh, Ed.

35:19.867 --> 35:23.829
We are gonna be so rich.

35:33.089 --> 35:36.007
Everything smells like fish
around here.

35:36.884 --> 35:40.178
Well, you could wash your socks
separately.

35:41.389 --> 35:44.641
What did that FBI man
want up here today?

35:44.809 --> 35:46.101
Very nice fellow.

35:47.019 --> 35:49.479
Asked a few questions.

35:49.939 --> 35:51.690
About what?

35:51.858 --> 35:54.860
Oh, he talked to Josie mostly.

35:55.027 --> 35:58.530
I had a problem with a fish.

35:58.698 --> 36:02.367
Took a liking to my percolator.

36:02.535 --> 36:05.287
What did he want
to talk to Josie about?

36:05.872 --> 36:08.206
Why don't you ask her?

36:14.589 --> 36:17.924
Here's the key, the ledger's inside.

36:18.092 --> 36:20.218
- Thank you.
- You betcha.

36:27.393 --> 36:29.060
Didn't he want to talk to me?

36:29.228 --> 36:31.897
Yeah, but we told him
you were on your world tour,

36:32.064 --> 36:34.149
he should contact
your press agent.

36:35.484 --> 36:39.029
Get your boots off my bed
and go to your room!

36:47.371 --> 36:51.917
I didn't want to get mink oil
on my bedspread.

36:57.423 --> 37:00.091
You got mink oil on your head.

37:24.450 --> 37:26.326
Two books.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.552
Oh.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.830
Leland?

38:53.998 --> 38:55.874
- Leland, stop it.
- We have to dance.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.335
We have to dance, Sarah.
We have to dance.

38:58.502 --> 38:59.878
For Laura.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.213
Oh, Leland, stop it.
Give that to me, give it to me.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.924
- We have to dance.
- Leland, Leland.

39:05.092 --> 39:06.760
Give it to me.

39:18.939 --> 39:20.940
What is going on in this house?

39:29.784 --> 39:34.412
Leland, what is going on
in this house?

39:36.123 --> 39:39.292
Oh, God!

40:36.392 --> 40:38.059
Laura.

40:39.103 --> 40:43.106
Laura.

40:52.616 --> 40:59.831
Through the darkness of future pasts
The magician longs to see

41:00.875 --> 41:05.628
One chants out between two worlds

41:07.339 --> 41:10.800
"Fire, walk with me"

41:11.719 --> 41:15.013
We lived among the people.

41:15.723 --> 41:19.934
I think you say, convenience store.

41:21.395 --> 41:23.438
We lived above it.

41:25.024 --> 41:28.902
I mean it like it is, like it sounds.

41:30.738 --> 41:34.699
I, too, have been touched
by the devilish one.

41:35.284 --> 41:38.077
Tattoo on the left shoulder.

41:39.205 --> 41:45.752
Ah, but when I saw the face of God,
I was changed.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.422
I took the entire arm off.

41:51.091 --> 41:52.926
My name is Mike.

41:53.093 --> 41:56.554
His name is Bob.

41:56.722 --> 41:58.723
Mike?

41:59.683 --> 42:03.186
Mike, can you hear me?

42:06.273 --> 42:09.943
Catch you with my Death Bag.

42:10.736 --> 42:14.239
You may think I've gone insane.

42:14.990 --> 42:18.201
But I promise

42:18.369 --> 42:22.580
I will kill again.

44:32.419 --> 44:34.962
But it is Laura Palmer.

44:38.467 --> 44:40.051
Are you Laura Palmer?

46:56.188 --> 46:58.648
Harry, it's Cooper.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.484
Meet me for breakfast, 7 a.m.,
the hotel lobby.
