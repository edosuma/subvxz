00:00.016 --> 00:01.517
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:01.541 --> 00:04.027
- I'm Will. I just moved in upstairs.
- Gunnar. Nice to meet you.

00:04.043 --> 00:05.678
- This is my girlfriend Scarlett.
- Nice to meet you.

00:05.701 --> 00:08.908
- Mama had a "friend."
- You mean like an affair?

00:08.962 --> 00:10.800
Call this guy for a roadie gig.

00:10.832 --> 00:13.475
We spend so much time
trying to keep out the bad

00:13.482 --> 00:15.093
that we end up missing out on the good.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.856
Scarlett? You got yourself a record deal.

00:16.890 --> 00:18.941
Sign the damn contract, please.

00:18.976 --> 00:20.610
How do you think Teddy would feel

00:20.644 --> 00:22.061
if he knew it was you

00:22.112 --> 00:24.113
who leaked all those lies about Rayna?

00:24.148 --> 00:26.365
Here's to our new baseball stadium.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.817
- (Albert) Lamar?
- (Gasps)

00:27.851 --> 00:29.051
Lamar?

00:30.621 --> 00:32.905
(Gossling's "Heart Killer" playing)

00:32.956 --> 00:37.293
♪ I'm known as a killer

00:37.327 --> 00:38.995
♪ a heart killer

00:39.029 --> 00:41.714
♪ I'll have it so you don't know

00:41.748 --> 00:44.984
♪ I'm nothing but a mean foe

00:45.018 --> 00:48.370

♪ you're love partner

00:51.541 --> 00:54.177
Are you tired?

00:54.211 --> 00:55.544
Are you kidding me?

00:55.562 --> 00:57.180
(Laughs) Good.

00:57.214 --> 00:58.981
(Laughs)

00:59.016 --> 01:03.519
But we should probably
talk about your mother.

01:03.553 --> 01:05.521
That's a mood killer.

01:07.524 --> 01:09.025
I'm sorry, but I crossed the line,

01:09.059 --> 01:10.226
and before I cross it again,

01:10.244 --> 01:13.395
I... I think we should think this through.

01:13.413 --> 01:15.898
Unless, of course, this is a one time thing.

01:18.285 --> 01:20.286
Well, do you want it to be?

01:20.337 --> 01:25.291
No. I thought you might.

01:25.325 --> 01:28.344
You've read too much of my bad press.

01:28.378 --> 01:32.965
I should probably resign as
your mom's sober companion.

01:33.016 --> 01:35.184
She is so fragile.

01:35.219 --> 01:37.570
Maybe we should just keep

01:37.604 --> 01:40.139
whatever's going on between us quiet

01:40.190 --> 01:43.893
till she's a little stronger.

01:43.927 --> 01:46.145
Not the healthiest plan.

01:47.296 --> 01:49.115
You got a better idea?

01:51.485 --> 01:52.952
No.

01:52.986 --> 01:55.104
Well, then I guess we're
done talking about my mama.

01:55.122 --> 01:56.622
- (Whispers) Are we?
- Mm-hmm.

01:59.126 --> 02:01.494
(Chuckles)

02:01.545 --> 02:03.512
(Knock on door)

02:06.466 --> 02:08.967
(Knock)

02:09.002 --> 02:11.053
(Exhales)

02:11.088 --> 02:13.756
(Sighs deeply)

02:16.727 --> 02:19.262
- Hey. It's the middle of the night.
- We got a family emergency.

02:19.296 --> 02:21.430
I gotta get my girls back to Nashville.

02:21.464 --> 02:24.500
- Are they okay?
- They... they're fine. It's, um, their grandfather.

02:24.534 --> 02:26.869
- And I was just gonna ask you if I might...
- My jet's at Teterboro.

02:26.818 --> 02:27.935
I'll just tell 'em you're on the way.

02:27.986 --> 02:29.136
Thanks.

02:29.171 --> 02:30.888
You're gonna be back for
the show tonight, right?

02:30.922 --> 02:32.590
I don't know. I might have to cancel.

02:32.624 --> 02:34.058
A... a sold-out show in New York?

02:34.092 --> 02:37.895
I'll let you know. Thank
you. Appreciate it. Thank you.

02:37.930 --> 02:40.314
All right. I'll see you in a bit.

02:40.349 --> 02:41.249
(Cell phone clatters)

02:41.283 --> 02:42.583
(Peggy) What?

02:42.634 --> 02:44.886
(Sighs) Lamar had a heart attack.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.787
Rayna's on her way back with the girls.

02:46.822 --> 02:49.140
I gotta meet 'em at the airport.

02:49.207 --> 02:50.858
Is it serious?

02:50.893 --> 02:52.727
You know, I don't know.
He's in cardiac I.C.U.

02:52.761 --> 02:54.946
But the... the girls are really upset.

02:56.548 --> 02:58.783
They'll all be coming back.

02:58.817 --> 03:01.385
- Right. I... I'll get my things together.
- Okay.

03:06.225 --> 03:08.075
(Sighs)

03:08.110 --> 03:10.645
Who was ringing the doorbell
at the crack of dawn?

03:10.679 --> 03:14.131
Uh, that was a messenger
picking up my contract

03:14.166 --> 03:16.334
at 9:40 A.M.

03:16.368 --> 03:18.603
Okay. (Laughs)

03:18.637 --> 03:21.305
Does that mean it is a done deal?

03:21.340 --> 03:23.274
You and Edgehill Records?

03:23.308 --> 03:25.676
I guess so.

03:25.710 --> 03:29.030
Good, because that means
I do not have to waste...

03:29.081 --> 03:30.715
this.

03:30.749 --> 03:33.484
- (Laughs) Oh, baby. If I start drinking now...
- (Refrigerator door closes)

03:33.518 --> 03:35.186
- I'm not gonna get anything done.
- Ah-ah!

03:35.220 --> 03:36.704
That attitude will not be tolerated.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.589
<i>But you can go get me a couple glasses.</i>

03:38.623 --> 03:41.642
- This is gonna be a celebration day.
- (Giggles)

03:41.693 --> 03:42.777
(Cork pops) Ooh!

03:42.811 --> 03:44.111
Ahh. And by the way,

03:44.146 --> 03:46.230
this is step one of a two-step process.

03:46.265 --> 03:48.416
- Mm-hmm?
- Step two involves... (Clears throat)

03:48.450 --> 03:49.767
Well, it involves the bedroom.

03:49.801 --> 03:52.053
- I'll tell you about that later on.
- (Laughs)

03:52.087 --> 03:54.605
But if I go back to bed, I think
it's gonna just be to sleep,

03:54.639 --> 03:56.691
'cause you were thrashing
around all last night.

03:56.725 --> 03:58.709
- I was?
- Mm-hmm.

03:58.744 --> 04:00.361
You having bad dreams about Jason?

04:02.247 --> 04:03.564
You wanna talk about it?

04:03.598 --> 04:05.349
I do not wanna talk about
what I can't remember.

04:05.383 --> 04:07.585
So, today is about you,

04:07.619 --> 04:09.770
and it's about celebrating your success.

04:09.805 --> 04:12.356
So I'm calling it the 24-hour
Scarlett O'Connor party.

04:12.391 --> 04:14.325
- Bottoms up. Oh, yeah.
- Oh...

04:14.359 --> 04:16.077
♪

04:16.128 --> 04:18.279
- That's a good dog.
- (Whimpers)

04:18.313 --> 04:19.880
I wish I could just go with you.

04:19.915 --> 04:21.197
- Just take me with you.
- (Laughs)

04:21.249 --> 04:22.633
It's only a week. You'll be fine.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.819
- You'll live.
- It's a week too long.

04:24.853 --> 04:27.405
(Indistinct conversations)

04:27.439 --> 04:28.739
- Oh, wait. I got something...
- I gotta go.

04:28.757 --> 04:31.425
- Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
- Uh...

04:31.460 --> 04:33.411
What is that? You want
me to water your plants?

04:33.445 --> 04:34.495
I don't have any plants. All right?

04:34.529 --> 04:36.480
I just want you to make yourself at home.

04:36.489 --> 04:37.889
Well, I have a home.

04:37.923 --> 04:40.291
Now you got a key to mine.

04:40.309 --> 04:41.526
(Laughs)

04:41.560 --> 04:42.711
Call me when you land, all right?

04:42.745 --> 04:44.296
- Hey.
- Yeah.

04:44.330 --> 04:46.081
(Engine turns over)

04:46.115 --> 04:47.799
(Indistinct conversations continue)

04:47.833 --> 04:49.267
(Car door closes)

04:49.302 --> 04:50.501
(Knocks on window)

04:52.271 --> 04:54.739
Avery? What are you doing here, man?

04:54.774 --> 04:57.525
Uh, I'm with the tour.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.544
- What, are you opening?
- No, I'm a roadie.

04:59.578 --> 05:01.363
I thought you had a... a deal

05:01.397 --> 05:04.849
- and a song on the radio and everything?
- Yeah, well, not anymore.

05:04.867 --> 05:06.751
(Man) Hey, kid. Whatever your name is.

05:06.786 --> 05:07.869
Name's Avery.

05:07.903 --> 05:09.220
Whatever.

05:09.255 --> 05:10.955
Hold up on that. Take
that stuff back inside.

05:10.989 --> 05:12.257
Good chance tonight's show is canceled.

05:12.291 --> 05:14.225
Wait. Hold on. Wait, wait. Canceled?

05:14.260 --> 05:16.795
Rayna's dad's in the hospital.
Guess it's pretty bad.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.431
I hate hospitals, ever since mom died.

05:20.449 --> 05:22.167
Please don't go there.

05:22.201 --> 05:24.152
Daddy's a fighter. He's gonna be fine.

05:24.186 --> 05:25.536
Nothing else.

05:25.554 --> 05:27.856
And, you know, mom just got
taken away from us too soon.

05:27.890 --> 05:29.541
- Tandy.
- Oh, hey.

05:29.575 --> 05:30.592
Um, you know what?

05:30.626 --> 05:31.726
Let me just talk to him really quick.

05:31.777 --> 05:33.345
Why don't you go in and start this?

05:33.379 --> 05:34.646
Okay.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.147
(Sighs)

05:36.165 --> 05:38.466
I wanna give him an
update on the stadium deal.

05:38.501 --> 05:40.552
- Uh, but they said family only.
- Albert. Albert.

05:40.586 --> 05:42.220
Do you really think I
care about this right now?

05:42.238 --> 05:44.039
Please, let me just go with my sister.

05:44.073 --> 05:46.975
<i>You're C.F.O. You should care about this.</i>

05:47.009 --> 05:49.344
God knows your father would want you to.

05:49.378 --> 05:52.197
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

05:56.886 --> 05:58.453
Hey.

05:58.487 --> 05:59.771
Where's Tandy?

05:59.805 --> 06:01.206
She's out talking to Albert.

06:03.542 --> 06:05.326
I thought you were on the road.

06:05.361 --> 06:07.362
I was. I had the girls with me, so...

06:07.396 --> 06:10.999
I must be in pretty bad
shape for you to miss a show.

06:11.050 --> 06:14.119
Well, they were worried.

06:14.153 --> 06:16.071
So I was worried.

06:16.105 --> 06:18.623
But I can see that you're
all full of piss and vinegar,

06:18.657 --> 06:20.191
so you must be feeling better.

06:20.226 --> 06:22.427
That's right. I am.

06:22.461 --> 06:26.431
There's no need for you
to stop what you're doing.

06:26.465 --> 06:31.069
I mean, the show must go on, right?

06:31.103 --> 06:33.938
Yeah.

06:33.973 --> 06:37.592
I will let Tandy know that
you would like to see her.

06:37.626 --> 06:39.060
You take care, daddy.

06:43.416 --> 06:44.949
Just because Rayna had to cancel

06:44.967 --> 06:46.384
does not mean that I should have to.

06:46.452 --> 06:47.519
This is the final night

06:47.553 --> 06:49.787
in the biggest country
music market there is,

06:49.805 --> 06:51.122
and I was supposed to close.

06:51.157 --> 06:53.024
I thought we were having a therapy session.

06:53.058 --> 06:55.126
She's dealing with a
career crisis here, okay?

06:55.177 --> 06:56.561
And mani-pedis help her think.

06:56.595 --> 06:57.795
You know, Marshall, you keep telling me

06:57.813 --> 06:59.514
that you have this roster
full of talented people.

06:59.548 --> 07:01.799
Would you just find someone to sub?

07:01.817 --> 07:03.468
Wasn't this your solo tour to begin with?

07:03.502 --> 07:05.003
Seriously.

07:05.037 --> 07:06.554
I mean, it's bad enough that my fans

07:06.605 --> 07:08.373
have to sit through
her show to get to mine.

07:08.407 --> 07:09.691
And I just checked.

07:09.725 --> 07:11.843
Your new single's had 50,000
downloads since midnight.

07:11.877 --> 07:13.528
I don't know why they
can't just get a local act

07:13.579 --> 07:14.712
to open up for you.

07:14.746 --> 07:15.814
I would just expand my set.

07:15.848 --> 07:17.381
Dante, can I talk to you for a minute?

07:17.399 --> 07:19.033
I can put a few more songs in there.

07:19.084 --> 07:20.135
Talk to the audience about 'em,

07:20.169 --> 07:21.302
get 'em excited about the new album.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.221
Maybe even negotiate a little extra cash

07:23.239 --> 07:25.523
as the night's sole performer.

07:25.558 --> 07:27.325
You know, will you tell Deacon

07:27.343 --> 07:29.844
- that he needs to get the band up to speed on the new stuff?
- (Keypad beeping)

07:29.879 --> 07:31.796
- I got it.
- What were you saying, mama?

07:31.830 --> 07:35.500
I took a bottle of vodka
from the honor bar last night.

07:35.518 --> 07:36.885
Well, I didn't drink it,

07:36.936 --> 07:39.604
but I tried to call you,
and you didn't answer. I...

07:39.638 --> 07:41.773
We need to focus on my therapy.

07:41.807 --> 07:45.810
And I think it's time
that Dante and I go home.

Um, listen, I'm real sorry
to hear about your dad.

08:09.208 --> 08:12.143
They say you might be canceling tonight,

08:12.178 --> 08:15.597
so that must mean it's pretty bad.

08:15.631 --> 08:18.183
I know this whole thing...

08:18.234 --> 08:23.137
has got to be pretty complex
for you, to say the least.

08:23.155 --> 08:26.107
I just wanted to let you
know I'm thinking about you.

08:26.141 --> 08:28.777
Uh, okay. Bye.

08:28.811 --> 08:30.912
Hey. We canceling or not?

08:30.946 --> 08:32.364
Not. Juliette's gonna go on.

08:32.414 --> 08:33.498
Of course she is.

08:33.532 --> 08:35.149
Juliette wants the band to have these ready

08:35.167 --> 08:36.451
by the time we go on tonight.

08:36.485 --> 08:37.785
What, ten new songs?

08:37.820 --> 08:38.787
She said they weren't new to you,

08:38.821 --> 08:40.488
and she's keeping it simple.

08:40.506 --> 08:42.957
New guy. We're missing
a set of Juliette's ears.

08:42.991 --> 08:44.325
Check her hotel suite. If it's not there,

08:44.343 --> 08:45.844
check the venue. Her dressing room.

08:45.878 --> 08:47.011
Bathroom. Tour bus.

08:47.046 --> 08:48.496
- Anywhere you think to look.
- Okay.

08:48.514 --> 08:50.098
Hey, you know, I thought
I'd be more of a load-in guy.

08:50.132 --> 08:51.933
Well, right now, you're
a do-what-you're-told guy.

08:56.021 --> 08:57.722
(Indistinct conversations)

08:57.773 --> 08:58.857
(Juliette) Thanks, Bo.

08:58.891 --> 09:01.342
You really need to pick
up the pace next time.

09:01.360 --> 09:02.477
Well?

09:02.511 --> 09:04.229
Well, I talked your mom off the ledge.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.864
She's in the greenroom
journaling right now.

09:05.898 --> 09:07.532
I told her I'd circle
back in a little while.

09:07.566 --> 09:08.850
Good.

09:08.868 --> 09:10.785
I'm gonna need you to
come to rehearsal with me.

09:10.820 --> 09:11.953
Apparently, the band's not thrilled

09:11.987 --> 09:14.205
about adding the new songs.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.157
Too bad. You're the boss.

09:16.191 --> 09:17.992
That's right.

09:18.026 --> 09:20.078
<i>I am the boss.</i>

09:20.129 --> 09:21.963
Yes, you are.

09:23.532 --> 09:25.333
(Hinges squeak)

09:25.367 --> 09:26.918
Damn, girl, you ever gonna get up?

09:26.969 --> 09:28.837
Probably not. What you razzing me for?

09:28.871 --> 09:30.922
You're the one who got
me back in here. (Giggles)

09:30.973 --> 09:32.257
'Cause we were supposed to be celebratin'.

09:32.308 --> 09:33.591
- Aah! (Giggles)
- Come on! Mwah.

09:33.642 --> 09:36.978
So... what do you wanna do
the rest of the day, huh?

09:37.012 --> 09:38.346
Mm...

09:38.380 --> 09:40.231
This, please?

09:40.266 --> 09:42.600
Will you write with me?

09:42.651 --> 09:44.719
We haven't done it in ages.

09:44.737 --> 09:47.405
You know, I'm not really in the mood...

09:47.440 --> 09:49.274
if that's all right. And I call this work,

09:49.325 --> 09:51.109
and we're supposed to be partying anyway.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.695
So... (Laughs)

09:53.729 --> 09:56.114
How about we go listen
to some music instead?

09:56.165 --> 09:57.999
- Okay.
- Yeah?

09:58.033 --> 09:59.167
You wanna bring Will, too?

09:59.201 --> 10:01.202
You guys got on really
well the other night.

10:01.236 --> 10:03.254
Yeah, sure. Whatever you want. Mm.

10:03.289 --> 10:05.039
What in the hell good is it

10:05.073 --> 10:07.509
to finance an entire hospital wing

10:07.543 --> 10:10.712
when I can't even get a damn
milk shake when I want it?

10:10.746 --> 10:13.798
These people are not your employees.

10:13.883 --> 10:16.417
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

10:16.452 --> 10:18.553
- You heard anything from the Governor?
- Yes.

10:18.587 --> 10:21.840
He's gonna talk to Teddy about
his plan for Subway Field.

10:21.874 --> 10:24.476
- Talk?
- Yeah.

10:24.527 --> 10:26.611
He'd better tell Teddy
there's only one location

10:26.645 --> 10:29.481
for that stadium, and it's on our land.

10:31.700 --> 10:32.650
(Cell phone rings)

10:32.685 --> 10:34.068
Ahem.

10:34.102 --> 10:35.153
Oh, no. (Ring)

10:35.204 --> 10:36.504
No. No more business.

10:36.539 --> 10:37.972
You need to rest.

10:38.006 --> 10:40.041
This is ridiculous. I don't belong in here.

10:40.075 --> 10:41.493
- Okay, daddy, daddy...
- And I damn sure

10:41.527 --> 10:42.877
- don't need you treating me like I'm a child.
- Okay.

10:42.912 --> 10:45.112
Back in this bed right now.

10:45.130 --> 10:46.231
(Groans)

10:46.265 --> 10:47.949
<i>You had a heart attack. (Pants)</i>

10:47.983 --> 10:50.134
And if you do not stay in this bed,

10:50.186 --> 10:51.436
I'm gonna call someone in
here with a sedative so fast,

10:51.470 --> 10:54.639
that your head's gonna spin.

10:54.690 --> 10:58.893

- All right, you know what?

11:34.630 --> 11:36.447
Let's take a quick break here, guys.

11:36.482 --> 11:37.398
Uh, we have a show in five hours.

We do not have time to take a break.

11:40.252 --> 11:42.403
- I just wanna talk to you a second.
- Yes.

11:42.438 --> 11:43.655
You're asking an awful lot

11:43.689 --> 11:45.089
out of all these people here, you know?

11:45.124 --> 11:46.808
- I'm asking for one day.
- Yeah, well, I just don't...

11:46.842 --> 11:49.260
- One day. That's not a lot... not now.
- I don't understand.

11:49.295 --> 11:50.678
Why didn't you just have
another act come in, huh?

11:50.713 --> 11:52.530
Or just cancel the damn
thing like anybody else would.

11:52.565 --> 11:54.515
Why should I have to cancel?

11:54.533 --> 11:55.733
Because what you're doing,
expanding your set this much,

11:55.768 --> 11:57.502
this close to showtime, is crazy.

11:57.536 --> 11:59.454
It's not crazy. I don't think it's crazy.

11:59.488 --> 12:01.306
- I do.
- Dante doesn't think it's crazy.

12:01.340 --> 12:03.758
Dante? What, your mother's
sober companion Dante?

12:03.792 --> 12:05.360
That Dante? Well, hell,

12:05.394 --> 12:06.427
why don't we see what
your, uh, cable guy thinks?

12:06.462 --> 12:08.096
Why don't we let him weigh in, you know?

12:08.130 --> 12:09.731
- You're hilarious. Hilarious.
- No, I'm serious. Why does he have any say

12:09.765 --> 12:10.648
- about what's going on out here?
- Because I asked him to.

12:10.683 --> 12:12.667
Why did you ask him?

12:12.685 --> 12:13.868
Because he's helping me! How is he
helping you? By being your yes-man?

12:13.903 --> 12:15.336
Saying "yeah" to any idea
you've got in your head?

12:15.370 --> 12:17.405
By helping me get an endorsement deal

12:17.439 --> 12:18.472
- that's gonna help my album...
- An endorsement deal.

12:18.490 --> 12:19.440
Skyrocket to the top of the charts?

12:19.474 --> 12:21.459
By renegotiating my deal

12:21.493 --> 12:23.861
- so I can get paid as a solo headliner?
- What does any of this have to do with music

12:23.896 --> 12:25.196
or what we're doing up here, Juliette?!

12:25.247 --> 12:27.181
By having my back because he's obviously

12:27.216 --> 12:30.385
the only person around here who does!

12:31.586 --> 12:32.604
Really?

12:32.638 --> 12:34.555
Yeah.

12:34.634 --> 12:36.953
I'm sorry you feel that way.

12:37.037 --> 12:38.404
Let's get back to work, guys.

12:38.422 --> 12:40.089
We got 10 songs to learn in 20 minutes.

12:40.124 --> 12:43.176
You know what? Y'all let me
know when you got it together.

12:43.210 --> 12:45.261
- I'll be in my bus.
- Yes, ma'am.

12:45.295 --> 12:47.497
(Man speaks indistinctly)

12:49.400 --> 12:50.633
Hi.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.545
- Hey.
- Hey, Ray.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.230
- You are so sweet.
- Aw.

12:54.264 --> 12:56.716
I got your sweet message.
Thanks for coming.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.784
Yeah, well, I thought
you might need somebody

12:58.802 --> 13:01.754
to lend an ear or a shoulder. I got both.

13:01.788 --> 13:02.972
Mm, I don't want you worrying about me.

13:03.007 --> 13:04.574
Well, he's no spring chicken.

13:04.608 --> 13:06.909
You know, a heart attack's pretty serious.

13:06.944 --> 13:08.995
- Yeah, well, true...
- (Lamar) This is ridiculous!

13:09.029 --> 13:10.730
- But this is daddy we're talking about.
- I don't belong here!

13:10.764 --> 13:12.031
- Also true.
- (Lamar and woman speaking indistinctly)

13:12.049 --> 13:13.966
That sounds like him right now.

13:13.984 --> 13:15.868
That's all right. I don't need your help.

13:15.902 --> 13:17.170
I can leave of my own accord.

13:17.204 --> 13:19.772
- Daddy, are you trying to kill yourself?
- (Groans)

13:19.807 --> 13:21.424
- (Woman) Oh, sir, please.
- Do you realize

13:21.458 --> 13:22.892
I can pull my funding and
have you fired like that?

13:22.926 --> 13:24.260
- All right, get him...
- Yes, I know.

13:24.311 --> 13:26.312
Daddy, what is going on? You
need to sit down right now.

13:26.346 --> 13:29.732
- I fell asleep for five minutes, and he just runs away.
- What in the hell is he doing here?

13:29.767 --> 13:32.168
I didn't come to upset you, Lamar.

13:32.219 --> 13:34.387
You get the hell out of here now!

13:34.421 --> 13:35.655
- Hey.
- Sir, please sit down.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.607
- I'm sorry. I'm gonna go.
- (Lamar) Now!

13:37.658 --> 13:39.492
- All right, down.
- Sit down. Please sit down!

13:39.526 --> 13:41.961
- (Rayna) Good heavens.
- (Man) All right, that's good. Just...

- Thank you.</i>

14:25.448 --> 14:26.598
You're welcome.

14:26.649 --> 14:28.066
But why am I the only one drinking?

14:28.101 --> 14:29.568
I had a beer.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.203
How about you, Mr. soda pop?

14:31.254 --> 14:33.055
I like to live vicariously, I guess.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.057
I think he stays sober
to pick up the ladies.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.842
Oh, you know how many numbers he's got

14:36.876 --> 14:38.627
- in his little black book?
- There's a black book?

14:38.645 --> 14:40.579
Oh, yeah. There's 2,000 numbers.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.564
No, no, he exaggerates.

14:42.599 --> 14:43.532
It's 1,900.

14:43.566 --> 14:44.766
(Chuckles)

14:44.801 --> 14:46.401
That's actually kinda icky.

14:46.435 --> 14:47.619
(Clink) I'm not saying I call 'em all.

14:47.670 --> 14:49.872
Just, uh, consider it more a hobby.

14:49.906 --> 14:51.924
(Laughs) He says he can pick
up a girl three minutes flat.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.075
- Three minutes flat?
- Mm-hmm.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.261
I have to see. Go do
your magic now, please.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.480
- I want to see it.
- All right.

14:58.514 --> 14:59.932
(Scarlett laughs) Go.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.667
Let's see, uh,

15:01.701 --> 15:03.352
watch and learn, Junior.

15:03.386 --> 15:05.754
Redhead, 2:00.

15:05.788 --> 15:07.906
Oh, my God. He's crazy.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.024
(Gunnar) Yeah, but I kinda like him.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.959
Excuse me, miss. Did I follow your band?

15:10.994 --> 15:13.178
But is he a good influence on you?

15:13.212 --> 15:15.464
Hey, you don't have to worry about me,

15:15.498 --> 15:17.349
'cause I am taken.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.635
(Laughs)

15:19.669 --> 15:21.219
Mwah.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.088
- What the hell's he doing?
- I don't know.

15:23.122 --> 15:24.639

friend Scarlett O'Connor...

right back there... she's, uh,
she's a little bit shy, but, uh,

15:40.556 --> 15:41.857
heck, I think we should hear her sing

15:41.891 --> 15:43.525
while it's still free of
charge. What do y'all say?

15:43.543 --> 15:45.827
- (Cheering)
- Yeah? All right.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.713
Come on now. Keep it going for Scarlett!

15:47.747 --> 15:49.681
Come on. Bring her up
here. Bring her up here.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.617
Yeah!

17:43.746 --> 17:45.547
Excuse me, Miss Barnes.

17:45.581 --> 17:47.165
- Uh, I found your ear monitors.
- Thanks. Where were they?

17:47.216 --> 17:48.550
Wardrobe rack.

17:48.584 --> 17:49.885
Are you new?

17:49.919 --> 17:51.086
First day.

17:51.120 --> 17:54.840
Where do I know you
from? You look familiar.

17:54.891 --> 17:58.193
I don't know. Nashville's a small place.

17:58.227 --> 17:59.161
Huh.

17:59.195 --> 18:01.113
It'll come to me.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.832
(People speaking indistinctly)

18:03.866 --> 18:05.100
You coming?

18:05.134 --> 18:06.168
Yeah, I'll be right there. Hey.

18:06.202 --> 18:08.854
Don't you think you should knock

18:08.888 --> 18:10.505
before you barge onto your boss' tour bus?

18:10.573 --> 18:11.973
I'm really sorry about that.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.376
I'm sorry, but that's
not gonna be good enough.

18:14.410 --> 18:16.278
We're gonna have to let you go. Excuse me?

18:16.312 --> 18:17.479
You're fired.

18:19.482 --> 18:21.283
(Rayna) Hey.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.918
(People speaking indistinctly)

18:22.952 --> 18:25.137
I... am so sorry.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.906
I have no idea what that was all about.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.275
I think he might be a
little delirious or something

18:30.309 --> 18:31.409
'cause of the meds.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.660
- Yeah.
- And all of it.

18:32.678 --> 18:33.645
(Sighs)

18:33.696 --> 18:35.680
What?

18:37.150 --> 18:39.568
Your mother was an incredible woman,

18:39.602 --> 18:42.888
but she wasn't easy on the men in her life.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.774
Your mother and I were together.

18:45.808 --> 18:48.126
You were the musician? (Gasps)

18:48.161 --> 18:51.379
I think I've gotta sit down.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.400
Look...

18:55.434 --> 18:56.851
Is that why you helped me?

18:56.869 --> 19:00.722
No, no, no, no. That was
'cause of your talent.

19:00.756 --> 19:02.090
You need to hear this.

19:02.125 --> 19:05.760
He loved your mother. We both did.

19:05.795 --> 19:09.364
She was... young and impulsive and...

19:09.398 --> 19:11.016
beautiful.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.651
But trying to hold on to her

19:12.685 --> 19:15.387
was like trying to hold on to a butterfly.

19:15.421 --> 19:17.622
And he knew it.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.007
That didn't stop him from trying,

19:19.041 --> 19:20.275
but he knew it.

19:21.677 --> 19:23.211
And...

19:23.246 --> 19:26.648
the night she crashed that car...

19:26.682 --> 19:29.518
her bags were packed.

19:29.552 --> 19:32.754
Rayna, she was desperate to break free.

19:34.690 --> 19:37.625
<i>(Phosphorescent) * see,
I was the wounded master *</i>

19:37.643 --> 19:40.295
I'm actually really worried about him.

19:40.329 --> 19:44.599
He doesn't sleep. He
doesn't write music anymore.

19:44.633 --> 19:46.418
He hasn't really written
anything since his brother died.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.436
I mean, not like what you guys

19:48.470 --> 19:49.688
were writing in the backyard
that time. It's different.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.039
His music is...

19:51.073 --> 19:52.557
<i>* And I was the holy lion *</i>

19:52.592 --> 19:54.125
I'm just glad you guys are friends.

19:54.177 --> 19:55.427
I don't know what's gonna happen

19:55.461 --> 19:56.862
if I have to go on the road
or something with this...

19:56.896 --> 19:58.380
with this Edgehill thing.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.749
You gonna be a big star,
that's what's gonna happen.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.234
- (Giggles)
- Yeah, you are.

20:02.285 --> 20:05.020
Here. Come on. Let's, uh,
let's take a quick photo.

20:05.054 --> 20:06.304
What?

20:06.339 --> 20:07.856
This way, I can say I knew you when.

20:07.890 --> 20:08.940
- Oh, you're funny.
- (Camera shutter clicks)

20:08.975 --> 20:11.076
- Fries are up.
- Oh, God. Thank you.

20:11.110 --> 20:13.028
(Mouth full) Will you take
a photo of all three of us?

20:13.062 --> 20:14.212
You have long arms.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.413
- Yeah, sure.
- Mm.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.532
Get in here. Hmm.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.767
(Giggles) (Camera shutter clicks)

20:18.801 --> 20:20.268
Looks like you got a voice
mail from Bucky Dawes.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.620
Who's that?

20:21.671 --> 20:23.438
He is Rayna Jaymes' manager.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.706
- Sorry.
- (Beeps)

20:24.740 --> 20:27.025
Now that's a number I
wouldn't mind getting.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.011
Oh, my God.

20:30.046 --> 20:33.348
(Beep) Rayna just got into town.
She wants to meet me tomorrow.

20:33.382 --> 20:35.083
Uh-oh.

20:35.117 --> 20:36.468
(Laughs)

20:36.502 --> 20:38.186
Well, I think we might
have to get you home.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.272
Will you carry me?

20:40.306 --> 20:41.740
I will try.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.541
- (Laughs) Oh, my God.
- Come on. Give me your hand.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.194
(Laughs) Floor's moving.

20:46.229 --> 20:47.679
- Whoops.
- That way?

20:47.713 --> 20:49.080
- Whoa.
- Okay.

20:49.131 --> 20:52.317
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

20:53.869 --> 20:55.287
Hey.

20:55.321 --> 20:57.005
Hey.

20:57.039 --> 20:59.374
He hasn't made a single
move since you left.

20:59.408 --> 21:03.061
He's probably just embarrassed by all this.

21:04.363 --> 21:06.615
He's a proud man.

21:06.649 --> 21:08.350
(Mouths word)

21:08.384 --> 21:10.652
- I wanna talk to you about something.
- (Monitor beeping erratically)

21:10.686 --> 21:12.671
- (Woman) I need some help in here.
- What?

21:12.722 --> 21:14.472
(Beeping continues) He's in
v-fib. Get the crash cart.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.790
- What? Is he okay?
- (Man) Somebody grab those leads.

21:15.808 --> 21:16.975
Step out of the way, please.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.143
Your father's having a cardiac arrest.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.278
(All speaking at once)

21:20.329 --> 21:22.097
- I think he's having another heart attack.
-Can we stay?

21:22.131 --> 21:23.315
(Woman) I'm sorry. Can I get
you to step out of the room?

21:23.349 --> 21:24.482
We'll take care of him.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.784
(Man) Keep the chest compressions going.

21:25.835 --> 21:27.669
Oh, you had enough already?

21:27.687 --> 21:29.437
Nah, man. I got the boot.

21:29.472 --> 21:30.989
For what?

21:31.040 --> 21:33.008
(Indistinct conversations)

21:33.042 --> 21:34.109
Nothing.

21:34.143 --> 21:35.943
Must've done something.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.345
All I did was see something.

21:37.380 --> 21:40.548
Juliette and that guy
she hangs around with.

21:40.583 --> 21:42.500
- Dante?
- Yeah.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.519
I saw 'em in a... compromising position,

21:44.553 --> 21:46.287
and then he saw me.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.523
(Indistinct conversations continue)

21:48.557 --> 21:50.175
Put your gear back on
the bus. I'll handle him.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.309
What?

21:51.360 --> 21:52.794
Get back to work.

21:54.697 --> 21:58.199
What are you doing? Hmm?

21:58.234 --> 22:01.169
Who gave you the authority to fire roadies?

22:01.203 --> 22:03.688
I don't see how that's any of your concern.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.073
Well, how the hell is it yours, man?

22:05.091 --> 22:06.391
Avery's on the stage crew here.

22:06.442 --> 22:08.259
As far as I can tell, he
hasn't done a damn thing wrong.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.245
That's not your call to make,
okay? You're the bandleader.

22:10.279 --> 22:11.446
(Chuckles) Yeah, and you're supposed to be

22:11.480 --> 22:13.514
the damn sober companion
to Juliette's mother.

22:13.566 --> 22:14.766
I don't remember the part of the program

22:14.800 --> 22:16.184
where you screw around
with your client's daughter,

22:16.218 --> 22:18.503
but to me, it's just
wrong on so many levels.

22:18.537 --> 22:19.704
Yeah, well, unlike you, what I'm doing

22:19.755 --> 22:21.489
is looking out for
Juliette's best interests.

22:21.524 --> 22:22.724
Oh, that's a good euphemism for it.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.592
Pot calling the kettle, isn't it?

22:24.627 --> 22:25.977
- What are you talking about?
- I just find it ironic

22:26.012 --> 22:27.095
that a guy who slept with her

22:27.129 --> 22:28.730
when she was at her most vulnerable

22:28.764 --> 22:30.849
and then takes a $50,000 guitar from her

22:30.900 --> 22:32.633
is lecturing me about ethics. (Scoffs)

22:32.651 --> 22:33.852
Are you kidding me?

22:33.903 --> 22:35.320
She tell you all that?

22:35.354 --> 22:38.640
Yeah. She trusts me.

22:42.078 --> 22:43.378
I don't.

22:43.412 --> 22:44.946
Till it comes down from Juliette,

22:44.980 --> 22:47.115
that kid Avery... he's back on this tour.

22:47.149 --> 22:49.817
You don't touch him. You don't talk to him.

22:54.143 --> 22:57.028
(people speaking indistinctly)

22:58.230 --> 23:00.281
Hey.

23:00.316 --> 23:02.283
(Sighs) How you doing?

23:02.318 --> 23:05.070
I'm not doing too good. I'm
climbing the walls in here,

23:05.104 --> 23:06.821
and you said you were gonna be right back.

23:06.856 --> 23:08.523
I'm right here.

23:08.557 --> 23:10.341
Dante, I wanna go home...

23:10.376 --> 23:12.026
tomorrow or as soon as possible.

23:12.061 --> 23:13.495
I... I wanna go home with you.

23:13.529 --> 23:16.431
Jolene, this isn't about
going home or drugs or alcohol.

23:16.465 --> 23:18.399
This is about Juliette,
and we both know it.

23:18.451 --> 23:19.884
You're jealous that I've
been spending time with her

23:19.919 --> 23:21.486
and helping her with her career,

23:21.537 --> 23:22.720
and... and you need to work through that.

23:22.755 --> 23:25.156
You can't just run away from it.

23:25.207 --> 23:28.393
(Sighs) When was the last time
that we had a therapy session?

23:28.427 --> 23:31.529
Yeah, well, Juliette doesn't wanna help me,

23:31.580 --> 23:33.714
- and clearly, neither do you.
- Now, Jolene, that's...

23:33.732 --> 23:35.834
That's not true. I care about you.

23:35.885 --> 23:37.402
- You do?
- Of course I do.

23:37.453 --> 23:39.120
You're... you're important to me.

23:39.138 --> 23:41.156
Then why don't you show me then?

23:41.190 --> 23:43.024
I want...

23:44.760 --> 23:45.894
What?

23:45.928 --> 23:47.328
You are disgusting.

23:47.363 --> 23:49.047
Juliette.

23:49.098 --> 23:50.799
- Baby, I'm...
- Juliette.

23:50.833 --> 23:52.250
Don't touch me!

23:52.284 --> 23:53.651
Baby, I have feelings for him. I'm sorry.

23:53.686 --> 23:55.553
- And I think he has feelings for me, too. I...
- No...

23:55.604 --> 23:57.856
You are unbelievable.

23:57.907 --> 24:00.125
Okay, I did not bring Dante
here to be your plaything.

24:00.159 --> 24:01.709
Okay, I brought him here to help you.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.229
You brought him here to help me,

24:04.263 --> 24:05.630
and you've stolen him from me.

24:05.664 --> 24:07.582
He was never yours.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.817
Look, I think we need
to go back in the room

24:08.851 --> 24:10.652
- before this escalates, okay?
- Oh, my God.

24:10.686 --> 24:13.104
You're sleeping with him.

24:13.139 --> 24:15.290
And you call me disgusting?

24:18.144 --> 24:19.878
(Door slams)

24:19.912 --> 24:22.747
(Crickets chirping)

24:22.798 --> 24:25.233
(Whispers) She is passed out cold.

24:25.267 --> 24:26.551
(Sighs)

24:26.585 --> 24:29.070
(Chuckles)

24:29.019 --> 24:31.087
(Groans) The night's still young.

24:31.121 --> 24:32.889
Feel like making some music?

24:32.907 --> 24:35.892
Uh... No. Not really, man.

24:35.910 --> 24:37.861
I'm... I haven't felt like it since...

24:37.895 --> 24:38.961
my brother died.

24:38.979 --> 24:40.229
Yeah.

24:40.247 --> 24:41.514
I don't know. I think I'm just tired.

24:41.549 --> 24:43.249
I haven't been sleeping too good.

24:43.284 --> 24:46.086
Look, I... I don't know what it's like

24:46.137 --> 24:48.755
to lose a brother.

24:48.789 --> 24:50.356
But I do know

24:50.391 --> 24:52.308
what it feels like to lose family.

24:52.343 --> 24:54.511
Yeah, then you know that

24:54.545 --> 24:56.946
I'm not feeling much of anything right now.

24:56.981 --> 25:02.268
Just kinda... empty, I
guess, about everything.

25:02.303 --> 25:03.653
- Not Scarlett.
- (Chuckles)

25:03.687 --> 25:05.972
Nope. (Chuckles)

25:06.023 --> 25:07.874
- (Chuckles)
- No, not her.

25:07.958 --> 25:11.661
Pretty much everything else,
though, man, music included.

25:11.695 --> 25:12.929
(Snaps fingers) I tell you what.

25:12.963 --> 25:15.064
Scarlett may have had
enough fun for one night,

25:15.082 --> 25:16.883
- but you...
- Shh.

25:16.934 --> 25:19.936
- (Lowered voice) But y... you sure as hell have not.
- No.

25:19.970 --> 25:22.021
(Laughs) All right?

25:22.072 --> 25:23.089
Looks good on you. Come on, cowboy.

25:23.124 --> 25:24.340
Hey, look.

25:24.375 --> 25:26.042
I'm not interested in chasing skirts.

25:26.076 --> 25:28.561
That's not what I had in mind.

25:28.596 --> 25:30.663
I think these will make
your pawpaw feel better.

25:30.698 --> 25:32.365
(Exhales) When can we see him?

25:32.399 --> 25:33.800
You know, I'm not sure.

25:33.834 --> 25:36.052
Your mom said she'll call
when, uh, when it's time.

25:36.086 --> 25:39.906
(Cell phone rings)

25:39.940 --> 25:42.191
(Ring)

25:42.209 --> 25:43.693
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:43.727 --> 25:45.328
I'm sorry to call you at home.

25:45.362 --> 25:46.896
I know you're with the girls.

25:46.914 --> 25:49.732
- No, it's okay. Something wrong? You sound upset.
- I just...

25:49.766 --> 25:53.536
I wanted you to know that
I am here for you in this.

25:53.571 --> 25:57.273
I just care about you so much,
and it's important to me that...

25:57.308 --> 26:00.276
that you know that, Teddy.

26:00.311 --> 26:02.278
I love you.

26:02.313 --> 26:05.715
Yeah, well, I... I feel the same.

26:05.749 --> 26:07.267
I do.

26:07.301 --> 26:09.151
(Sniffles) Good.

26:09.170 --> 26:10.920
Well, I know you have your hands full.

26:10.938 --> 26:12.255
I... I'll let you go.

26:12.289 --> 26:14.891
No, o... okay. Yeah. I'll... I'll, um,

26:14.925 --> 26:16.543
- I'll talk to you later.
- Bye.

26:16.577 --> 26:18.344
Yeah, bye.

26:21.849 --> 26:24.767
Oh, hey. How is he?

26:24.802 --> 26:25.935
The bypass surgery went well.

26:25.970 --> 26:27.803
But there were some complications.

26:27.821 --> 26:28.922
Meaning what?

26:28.956 --> 26:30.690
He had some severe hemorrhaging.

26:30.741 --> 26:32.542
We'll watch him closely
for the next 24 hours.

26:32.576 --> 26:34.310
How long before we get to see him?

26:34.328 --> 26:35.762
He won't be conscious for some time.

26:35.796 --> 26:38.648
You should both go home and get some rest.

26:38.682 --> 26:39.816
Thank you.

26:39.850 --> 26:42.085
No problem.

26:42.119 --> 26:43.970
Why don't I stay with
him for when he wakes up,

26:44.004 --> 26:45.538
and you go home and be with the girls?

26:45.589 --> 26:47.106
No, the girls are already asleep.

26:47.141 --> 26:49.642
- Why don't I stay? You know, you go home.
- Yeah?

26:49.677 --> 26:51.477
I'll take it off your hands for a change.

26:51.529 --> 26:53.479
You know, I really could use a shower.

26:53.514 --> 26:55.348
Okay.

26:59.536 --> 27:02.355
Hey, did you know it was Watty?

27:04.692 --> 27:06.943
Why didn't you tell me when
you told me about the affair?

27:06.961 --> 27:09.362
(Sighs)

27:09.396 --> 27:12.015
I didn't know how to tell
you something like that.

27:12.049 --> 27:15.518
What do you remember about mom?

27:15.553 --> 27:17.870
She was a lot like you.

27:17.905 --> 27:21.791
And that's why daddy never
said anything about it.

27:21.825 --> 27:23.660
No matter how much it hurt him

27:23.694 --> 27:26.112
and now matter how much it changed him,

27:26.146 --> 27:29.415
he worshiped her.

27:29.450 --> 27:33.803
You know, if you ever wonder
why he was so screwed up...

27:36.306 --> 27:38.725
You should go get your shower.

27:38.759 --> 27:41.060
Okay.

27:44.848 --> 27:45.881
(Kiss)

27:45.899 --> 27:47.817
I love you.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.160
<i>This is Deacon. Leave a message.</i>

27:58.178 --> 28:00.013
Hey.

28:00.047 --> 28:02.582
Oh, you're probably in the
middle of a show right now.

28:08.906 --> 28:10.073
(Shifts gears)

28:10.107 --> 28:11.374
- What are we doing?
- (Train horn honking)

28:11.408 --> 28:13.393
The only true way to get over death...

28:13.427 --> 28:15.778
(Shifts gears)

28:15.813 --> 28:18.665
is to tempt it a little.

28:18.716 --> 28:20.900
- (Engine revs, tires screech)
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

28:20.934 --> 28:23.819
(Laughs) Yeah, very funny, Will.

28:23.837 --> 28:24.887
Slow down.

28:24.922 --> 28:26.306
(Crossing bells clanging)

28:26.340 --> 28:27.890
Will, stop the damn car.

28:27.925 --> 28:30.059
(Train horn blaring,
crossing bells clanging)

28:30.094 --> 28:31.761
What are you doing?!

28:31.795 --> 28:33.963
Aah!

28:33.981 --> 28:35.431
(Crossing bells clanging)

28:35.465 --> 28:36.983
Aah! Aah! (Brakes squeal)

28:37.017 --> 28:38.634
Ah! Ha!

28:38.652 --> 28:40.937
Whoo!

28:40.971 --> 28:42.655
You crazy son of a bitch!

28:42.690 --> 28:44.324
(Laughs)

28:44.358 --> 28:46.475
That was the stupidest
thing I've ever seen!

28:46.493 --> 28:48.945
We could be dead! We
should be dead right now!

28:48.979 --> 28:51.080
But we're not!

28:51.115 --> 28:52.949
(Panting) No.

28:52.983 --> 28:54.483
(Crossing bells clanging)

28:54.501 --> 28:56.969
You wanna go again?

28:58.835 --> 29:00.853
(Cheering)

29:00.887 --> 29:03.656
(Amplified voice) Thank you, Brooklyn!

29:03.690 --> 29:06.842
And thank you so much to
all the Rayna fans out there.

29:06.877 --> 29:08.110
I'm sorry she couldn't be here tonight,

29:08.128 --> 29:09.711
but we're gonna make it up to y'all.

29:09.729 --> 29:12.832

Wait. So you ignore me during my show...

31:10.225 --> 31:12.060
- I didn't ignore you.
- Because I shared during a therapy session?

31:12.094 --> 31:14.529
Or is it because you're
not my go-to guy anymore?

31:14.547 --> 31:15.697

want to be your go-to guy.

31:15.731 --> 31:17.716

bad influence after all.

33:11.931 --> 33:13.298
Can I come in?

33:19.088 --> 33:21.556
Your mother isn't talking to me.

Well, I'm not talking to her, either.

wedge between you and your mom.

33:32.752 --> 33:35.136
You didn't.

33:35.171 --> 33:37.989
It was already there, trust me.

33:38.074 --> 33:40.642
I don't know. I just...

33:40.676 --> 33:43.945
maybe it's 'cause we both are
looking for the same thing.

I'm not the first guy that
she's tried this with, am I?

33:46.866 --> 33:49.634
No.

33:49.668 --> 33:52.036
But you're gonna be the last.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.655
How's he doing?

33:53.689 --> 33:55.090
Rayna's with him.

33:55.124 --> 33:56.975
Gives me a little time
to go over everything,

33:57.009 --> 33:58.309
just in case.

33:58.344 --> 34:01.746
We both know your dad's
one stubborn son of a bitch.

34:01.781 --> 34:03.765
Death's gonna have to deal
him a better hand than this

34:03.799 --> 34:05.767
to take him out of the game.

34:05.801 --> 34:07.736
Well, I don't disagree.

34:07.770 --> 34:10.321
But having said that, I need
to know about every aspect

34:10.356 --> 34:11.989
of my father's life.

34:12.041 --> 34:13.757
Far as I can tell, you already do.

34:13.793 --> 34:16.444
Really?

34:16.478 --> 34:18.663
Then why is he getting phone
calls from Peggy Kenter?

34:52.286 --> 34:54.639
Strangely, it feels like

34:54.672 --> 34:56.306
I know my mother better today

34:56.341 --> 34:58.509
and like I didn't know my father at all.

34:58.544 --> 35:01.445
Yeah, well, it's all through
a different lens now, you know?

35:01.480 --> 35:02.713
Mm.

35:02.748 --> 35:05.299
Which makes sense. You were
only 12 when your mom died.

35:05.334 --> 35:07.702
Things look different through
the eyes of a 12 year old.

35:07.736 --> 35:10.071
Yeah.

35:10.105 --> 35:11.822
(Inhales deeply) What are
the odds of a 16 year old

35:11.857 --> 35:13.791
getting kicked out of the house?

35:13.825 --> 35:15.693
I remember that. (Chuckles)

35:15.727 --> 35:18.246
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

35:18.280 --> 35:21.215
That's when Watty brought
you your first paying gig.

35:21.250 --> 35:24.318
That's right. (Laughs)

35:24.353 --> 35:27.154
No wonder my father got so furious at me.

35:27.189 --> 35:29.773
That was the biggest fight we had ever had.

35:29.791 --> 35:32.393
Kicked me out of the house.

35:32.427 --> 35:33.694
Way I remember it, he
said that you were allowed

35:33.745 --> 35:37.315
to stay in his house but that
you had to live by his rules.

35:37.349 --> 35:40.268
Well, that wasn't gonna happen.

35:40.302 --> 35:43.170
No. So you left.

35:43.205 --> 35:45.640
Guess I got that from my mom.

35:47.276 --> 35:49.043
I did have a mouth on me.

35:49.077 --> 35:50.928
Some things never change, I guess.

35:50.963 --> 35:53.397
- Shut up.

Rayna offers her apologies.

36:29.284 --> 36:32.570
Oh, no. I... I heard what
happened to Ms. Jaymes' father.

36:32.604 --> 36:34.071
I truly hope he's all right.

36:34.089 --> 36:35.589
I'll pass that along.

36:37.376 --> 36:38.759

36:38.810 --> 36:40.745

talking producers and tours.

36:40.779 --> 36:42.897

- Mm-hmm.

Come on.

Oh, my goodness. (Chuckles)

36:48.954 --> 36:51.689
Everyone grab a glass of champagne.

36:51.723 --> 36:53.107
Scarlett, Bucky.

36:54.526 --> 36:56.326
Thank you.

36:56.345 --> 36:58.496
I would like to toast Scarlett O'Connor,

36:58.530 --> 37:00.815
a soon-to-be star,

37:00.899 --> 37:02.950
and the first artist to
sign to Rayna's label.

37:02.984 --> 37:05.102
- (All) Hear, hear.
- Thank you so much. It's...

37:05.136 --> 37:06.470
it's such a pleasure to be here.

What, so Dante's not coming? You fired him?

40:36.781 --> 40:39.349
As your sober companion, yes.

40:39.367 --> 40:42.820
But I hired him as my manager.
