Tell me...

41:23.648 --> 41:26.317
...who is it that trumps a princess?

41:27.610 --> 41:29.362
No one.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.533
And everyone.

41:34.617 --> 41:36.494
What great family is she from?

41:37.787 --> 41:40.915
None. She's the daughter of a blacksmith.

41:42.458 --> 41:46.921
And for her you would risk your kingship,
your kingdom?

41:48.256 --> 41:50.591
Without her, they're worth nothing to me.

41:53.136 --> 41:54.595
Hmm.

41:59.934 --> 42:04.230
| would give up my own kingdom
to be so loved.

42:09.110 --> 42:11.696
Farewell, Arthur.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.407
Farewell, princess.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.259
Have I been a fool?

42:34.886 --> 42:37.013
To give up so much for a woman
who betrayed me...

42:37.180 --> 42:39.182
...a woman who I might not even see again?

42:39.348 --> 42:40.641
You will see her again.

42:41.517 --> 42:45.480
You did the right thing, my lord,
as I knew you would.

42:45.646 --> 42:47.315
And how could you be so sure?

42:48.608 --> 42:51.235
Because you're Arthur.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.529
You're noble.
You're the once and future king.

42:55.239 --> 42:57.033
Doomed to be a bachelor.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.826
[CHUCKLES]

42:58.993 --> 43:01.913
What's the point of loving someone
who cannot be found?

43:02.914 --> 43:04.415
Gwen will be found.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.586
You will find each other.

43:10.463 --> 43:12.465
Are you really wise, Merlin,
or just a prating fool?

43:12.632 --> 43:14.592
| can no longer tell.

43:20.515 --> 43:23.184
As if there was ever any doubt.

43:25.853 --> 43:28.314
ANNOUNCER:
Merlin.

43:29.232 --> 43:30.608
It's time.
