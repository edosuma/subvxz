- <i>Previously on</i> Gotham...
- On the count of three,

00:03.768 --> 00:05.630
instead of telling me who you love,

00:05.659 --> 00:07.535
- tell me who to kill.
- Kill Lee.

00:07.578 --> 00:10.913
JERVIS: You chose Lee
because you love Vale.

00:10.981 --> 00:12.915
ALICE: <i>If a person comes
into contact with my blood,</i>

00:12.983 --> 00:14.083
<i>it changes them.</i>

00:17.020 --> 00:19.522
Listen to me! I would never
do anything to hurt you.

00:19.590 --> 00:20.623
Kristen.

00:20.691 --> 00:21.824
No!

00:21.892 --> 00:23.159
You wanted to save Lee.

00:23.227 --> 00:24.894
You knew he would do the opposite.

00:24.962 --> 00:27.029
You love Lee, which means we're done.

00:27.097 --> 00:29.098
I have found someone. I have no choice

00:29.166 --> 00:31.267
- but to confess my feelings to Ed.
- <i>Da.</i>

00:31.335 --> 00:33.369
Is this about the test they're
running on Alice Tetch's blood?

00:33.437 --> 00:35.805
Yes. The rats were exhibiting
manic tendencies...

00:35.873 --> 00:38.007
- Violent rage.
- I assume they're, uh,

00:38.075 --> 00:39.075
working on a cure.

00:39.142 --> 00:40.643
Yes, but it could take years.

00:40.711 --> 00:41.577
Nobody move!

00:41.645 --> 00:43.312
- (gunshot)
- What is going on?

00:43.380 --> 00:45.047
I'm afraid your evening
has been hijacked.

00:45.115 --> 00:48.217
- BULLOCK: Glasses down!
- (gunshot)

00:48.285 --> 00:50.653
- Is that my dear sister I see?
- <i>(amplified heartbeat)</i>

00:50.721 --> 00:52.121
She's in you, isn't she?

00:52.189 --> 00:53.990
- Miss Kringle?
- No, my name's Isabella.

00:54.057 --> 00:55.558
You remind me of someone
that I used to know.

00:55.626 --> 00:56.526
<i>I met someone.</i>

00:56.593 --> 00:58.194
I think I'm in love. (laughs)

00:58.262 --> 01:00.329
I want to rejoin the GCPD.

01:00.397 --> 01:01.531
Welcome back, Detective.

02:15.806 --> 02:17.907
GCPD! Hands in the air!

02:19.109 --> 02:20.443
Back away, slowly.

02:22.412 --> 02:24.180
This ain't what it looks like.

02:24.247 --> 02:26.382
Explain it to me down at the precinct.

02:26.450 --> 02:29.185
For now, you'd be wise
to keep your mouth shu...

02:35.993 --> 02:38.260
Listen, uh, can we talk about this?

02:39.496 --> 02:41.564
Be reasonable, man.

02:41.632 --> 02:42.965
(groans softly)

02:43.033 --> 02:44.467
Look, I didn't kill anybody, okay?

02:44.534 --> 02:47.303
I'm the cleaner, that's it.

02:47.371 --> 02:49.338
You're just the cleaner.

02:49.406 --> 02:51.674
Yeah.

02:51.742 --> 02:53.809
You're just the guy
who chops up the bodies

02:53.877 --> 02:55.778
and dumps them in a vat of acid.

02:55.846 --> 02:57.079
That's it.

03:01.051 --> 03:03.252
What are you doing, man?

03:04.660 --> 03:06.555
Just... take me in, okay?

03:06.623 --> 03:08.090
Oh, I'll bet that's what you want.

03:08.158 --> 03:10.259
For me to read you your rights,

03:10.327 --> 03:11.594
make sure you get a lawyer.

03:11.662 --> 03:14.063
Two, three years from now,
I see you on some corner,

03:14.131 --> 03:15.598
free as a bird.

03:15.666 --> 03:18.134
Any other night, yeah.

03:18.201 --> 03:22.438
It would eat at me,
but, yeah, I'd do it.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.440
Not tonight.

03:25.780 --> 03:26.920
The Toad.

03:26.965 --> 03:28.411
He-he's the one you
want. He gave me the job.

03:28.478 --> 03:31.087
See, something's gotten into me.

03:32.015 --> 03:33.315
When I see a scumbag like you,

03:33.383 --> 03:35.518
my blood starts boiling in my veins.

03:35.585 --> 03:38.587
I just want to punish
you, make you suffer.

03:38.655 --> 03:41.858
Up until now, I've been
able to control it.

03:41.903 --> 03:43.382
<i>(amplified heartbeat)</i>

03:44.149 --> 03:46.262
But it's getting stronger inside of me.

03:46.329 --> 03:47.753
Please.

03:47.798 --> 03:49.966
The Toad, I told you.

03:50.034 --> 03:51.601
He's the one.

03:51.669 --> 03:53.102
Just arrest me.

03:53.170 --> 03:54.337
Arrest me!

03:54.405 --> 03:55.571
We're past that.

03:55.639 --> 03:57.006
- Please! (screams)

04:03.885 --> 04:05.019
Morning.

04:05.086 --> 04:06.554
MARIO: We knew what we
were getting into, right?

04:06.621 --> 04:09.156
When we agreed to let my dad
throw us an engagement party?

04:09.224 --> 04:11.292
(Thompkins laughs)

04:11.359 --> 04:12.726
Oh, we knew.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.029
I mean, who are these people?

04:15.096 --> 04:16.197
He's very proud of you.

04:16.264 --> 04:18.399
And he wants all of Gotham to know that.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.000
Well, he succeeded, 'cause
he invited most of the city.

04:21.069 --> 04:22.336
(laughs)

04:22.404 --> 04:23.671
How are you so okay with this?

04:23.738 --> 04:25.606
Because I agree with him.

04:25.674 --> 04:28.008
He should be proud. As am I.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.679
How did I get so lucky?

04:38.353 --> 04:40.054
What is it?

04:43.592 --> 04:45.659
James Gordon is returning to the GCPD.

04:47.549 --> 04:49.514
- When?
- He starts today.

04:52.434 --> 04:54.702
Um... how long have you known this?

04:54.769 --> 04:55.703
A few days.

04:55.770 --> 04:58.228
I'm sorry, I should
have told you sooner.

05:00.041 --> 05:02.243
It's fine.

05:02.310 --> 05:04.311
Is it?

05:04.379 --> 05:06.480
I don't know, Lee.

05:06.548 --> 05:08.415
We agreed he wouldn't
be part of our lives.

05:08.483 --> 05:10.317
A-And now you're gonna
be working with him?

05:10.385 --> 05:11.819
That's a part of our lives.

05:11.886 --> 05:13.220
Do you trust me?

05:13.288 --> 05:14.588
Because if you do,

05:14.656 --> 05:16.590
then nothing else matters.

05:18.460 --> 05:19.660
Of course I trust you.

05:19.728 --> 05:21.462
And you're right, you're right,

05:21.529 --> 05:23.431
it's all gonna be okay. It's just...

05:24.639 --> 05:25.966
when I think about what
happened with Tetch,

05:26.034 --> 05:28.369
a-and the things that Gordon said, I...

05:28.436 --> 05:29.938
So, don't think about it.

05:31.474 --> 05:32.906
I'll try.

05:34.112 --> 05:36.377
But if you accidentally shot him...

05:36.444 --> 05:37.878
I'd be okay with that, too.

05:37.946 --> 05:39.546
No promises.

05:41.405 --> 05:42.613
See you tonight.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.254
Yeah.

05:47.322 --> 05:49.556
(door opens)

05:53.650 --> 05:55.462
Lock this bum up.

05:55.530 --> 05:57.665
(clamoring)

06:02.937 --> 06:03.937
Hey, hey, hey!

06:04.005 --> 06:05.372
There you are.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.975
We got a call. Warehouse
district. You coming?

06:08.043 --> 06:09.710
That's it? No "welcome back"?

06:09.778 --> 06:12.046
Please. If we had a big to-do
every time you came back

06:12.113 --> 06:14.281
to the GCPD, we'd never
catch any bad guys.

06:14.349 --> 06:15.182
<i>Ándale,</i> partner.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.451
Oh, and, uh,

06:17.519 --> 06:19.353
I believe this...

06:19.421 --> 06:20.788
belongs to you.

06:23.191 --> 06:24.591
You coming or what?

06:25.527 --> 06:26.727
Yeah, I'm coming.

06:30.198 --> 06:32.833
What must be broken
before it can be used?

06:32.901 --> 06:34.068
Eggs.

06:34.135 --> 06:36.003
Correct! As always.

06:36.071 --> 06:38.439
(sighs)

06:38.506 --> 06:42.176
Oh, Edward, you spoil me.

06:42.243 --> 06:43.777
You make it easy.

06:45.980 --> 06:47.648
I'm gonna miss you.

06:47.716 --> 06:50.084
I'm only gone two days.

06:50.151 --> 06:51.952
Well, actually, your conference

06:52.020 --> 06:54.722
ends at 1:45 on Monday.

06:54.789 --> 06:58.092
With traffic, that puts
you in at 5:30 into Gotham.

06:58.159 --> 06:59.493
If you leave on time today,

06:59.561 --> 07:01.995
which I'm sure that you will... Mm-hmm.

07:02.063 --> 07:03.797
You'll be gone for 44
and one half hours.

07:05.333 --> 07:06.400
Less than two days.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.568
(chuckles softly)

07:07.635 --> 07:09.665
I will hold on to that thought.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.306
Cream! I forgot your cream.

07:12.374 --> 07:13.640
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

07:13.708 --> 07:17.673
So what does one do at a
librarian's conference?

07:18.513 --> 07:20.647
It would bore you.

07:20.715 --> 07:24.931
Nothing that you would say,
do or think could bore me.

07:26.370 --> 07:29.056
In that case, let me
read you my schedule.

07:29.124 --> 07:30.557
Ooh!

07:32.394 --> 07:33.727
(whistles softly)

07:33.795 --> 07:35.362
(clears throat)

07:36.831 --> 07:39.017
Where did those glasses come from?

07:39.265 --> 07:40.293
These?

07:40.338 --> 07:43.070
These are my backup pair.
I normally wear contacts.

07:43.138 --> 07:44.872
I thought you knew that.

07:46.307 --> 07:47.808
Something wrong?

07:51.212 --> 07:53.414
Edward, what is it?

07:53.481 --> 07:56.049
You look like you've seen a ghost.

07:56.117 --> 07:58.085
Excuse me.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.089
(panting)

08:03.525 --> 08:04.792
(lock clicks)

08:11.166 --> 08:12.966
It's just a pair of glasses.

08:15.003 --> 08:18.272
KRINGLE: I remember you
loved that style on me.

08:18.339 --> 08:19.473
(gasps)

08:23.044 --> 08:24.778
(gasps) Oh, dear.

08:24.846 --> 08:25.913
(panting)

08:25.980 --> 08:28.215
I haven't upset you, have I, Ed?

08:28.283 --> 08:29.650
(giggles)

08:29.717 --> 08:31.118
I would've thought you
would've been used to

08:31.186 --> 08:33.520
seeing people in mirrors.

08:33.587 --> 08:35.155
You're just in my head.

08:35.222 --> 08:37.090
Like that makes a difference.

08:37.158 --> 08:40.828
But honestly, besides the fact
that she looks just like me,

08:40.895 --> 08:44.498
you went from someone who files
papers in a police station

08:44.566 --> 08:47.501
to someone who files books in a library.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.036
Not super original.

08:49.103 --> 08:50.938
You and Isabella are...

08:52.907 --> 08:54.575
you're somewhat different.

08:54.642 --> 08:57.377
Well, I'm dead. (chuckles)

08:57.445 --> 08:58.712
And she's alive.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.482
But how long will that last?

09:02.517 --> 09:04.518
Until you...

09:04.586 --> 09:06.119
I...

09:06.187 --> 09:07.721
(mimics choking)

09:07.789 --> 09:10.123
I would never hurt Isabella.

09:10.191 --> 09:13.835
Bet you would've said
the same thing about me.

09:15.029 --> 09:16.864
Face it, Ed.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.565
You're a killer.

09:18.633 --> 09:21.802
It's only a matter of time before...

09:21.870 --> 09:23.804
(panting)

09:30.958 --> 09:34.327
Okay, so, a uni I.D.'d the vic.

09:34.394 --> 09:37.497
One Paulie Penopolus,
aka Paulie Pennies.

09:37.564 --> 09:39.298
Cleanup guy for the Gotham underworld.

09:39.366 --> 09:41.667
Bingo. I'm thinking it was
some kind of business deal.

09:41.735 --> 09:43.102
Maybe an unhappy customer.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.804
Perhaps a competitor.

09:44.872 --> 09:46.005
Good place to start.

09:46.073 --> 09:47.601
Hey, listen, seriously, Jim...

09:48.696 --> 09:50.576
I'm glad you're back.

09:50.644 --> 09:52.011
Me too, Harv.

09:52.079 --> 09:53.379
Feels good.

09:55.415 --> 09:57.583
(camera clicking, indistinct
police radio chatter)

10:05.526 --> 10:07.426
(officer coughs)

10:10.493 --> 10:12.717
This wasn't just business.

10:13.971 --> 10:16.169
We should call Barnes.

10:27.703 --> 10:30.383
You know why I'm here.

10:32.024 --> 10:33.786
Oh, yes.

10:33.854 --> 10:35.993
Yes, indeed.

10:36.072 --> 10:38.126
She's in there, isn't she?

10:39.154 --> 10:40.808
Inside of you.

10:45.165 --> 10:47.600
Hello, sister dear.

10:47.668 --> 10:49.569
<i>(amplified heartbeat)</i>

10:54.807 --> 10:56.040
Just tell me.

10:57.482 --> 10:58.749
You grew up with your sister.

10:58.817 --> 11:01.418
You've seen this virus firsthand.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.554
How do I beat it?

11:03.621 --> 11:04.521
Hmm.

11:04.589 --> 11:06.657
I believe

11:06.725 --> 11:09.093
the way this works is...

11:09.160 --> 11:12.390
you give me something,
I give you something.

11:12.413 --> 11:13.937
(singsongy): Ticktock.

11:13.993 --> 11:16.000
How's about I let you keep your teeth?!

11:16.067 --> 11:16.734
Or...

11:16.801 --> 11:18.435
my sister's virus

11:18.503 --> 11:19.870
is a beautiful thing.

11:19.938 --> 11:22.740
It makes the darkest
parts of a person sing.

11:23.775 --> 11:26.944
What darkness in you...

11:27.012 --> 11:30.647
has Alice brought to life?

11:30.715 --> 11:32.316
Tell me that,

11:32.384 --> 11:34.485
and I'll tell you everything I know.

11:42.293 --> 11:43.861
Criminals.

11:44.763 --> 11:47.231
The guilty.

11:47.298 --> 11:49.700
My anger at them.

11:49.768 --> 11:53.137
Oh, but it's not anger <i>I</i> see.

11:54.706 --> 11:57.408
Rage.

11:57.475 --> 11:59.476
Violent, bloody

11:59.544 --> 12:01.712
rage.

12:03.882 --> 12:05.816
All right, Tetch, my turn.

12:06.751 --> 12:08.652
Is there a cure?

12:08.720 --> 12:10.220
(sighs)

12:12.767 --> 12:14.758
Yes.

12:14.826 --> 12:17.094
There is a cure.

12:17.162 --> 12:18.862
What is it?

12:20.498 --> 12:21.732
You give in,

12:21.800 --> 12:24.468
and let my dear sister win! (laughs)

12:24.536 --> 12:26.370
You think I'm playing?!

12:26.438 --> 12:27.671
Have you heard the voices?

12:27.739 --> 12:29.640
What voices?

12:29.707 --> 12:32.676
The virus, even as it grows
stronger, waxes and wanes.

12:32.744 --> 12:34.845
You may have the <i>illusion</i>

12:34.913 --> 12:36.914
you're winning.

12:36.981 --> 12:38.916
Then you hear the voices.

12:40.248 --> 12:44.088
Those dark voices from deep within you,

12:44.155 --> 12:47.558
whispering... whispering...

12:47.625 --> 12:48.892
<i>(amplified heartbeat)</i>

12:48.960 --> 12:50.360
and finally,

12:50.428 --> 12:53.764
you'll see the world as it really is.

12:53.832 --> 12:57.634
Then there will be no
more Captain Barnes,

12:57.702 --> 12:59.736
only Alice.

12:59.804 --> 13:01.338
<i>(heart beating faster)</i>

13:01.406 --> 13:03.407
- My dear Alice.
- (gasps)

13:03.475 --> 13:04.875
You don't know me!

13:04.943 --> 13:07.344
You've dirtied your hands, haven't you?

13:07.412 --> 13:11.215
And now you're desperately
trying to make it right.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.752
I <i>can</i> make it right.

13:19.524 --> 13:20.591
(knocks)

13:20.658 --> 13:22.693
(door buzzes, opens)

13:29.968 --> 13:31.301
You're back.

13:32.370 --> 13:34.705
I'm back.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.040
I suppose it was only a matter of time.

13:37.824 --> 13:40.177
Once a cop, always a cop.

13:48.887 --> 13:52.589
For better or worse,
this is where I belong.

13:52.657 --> 13:55.648
- How's Vale?
- Good. I think.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.461
She's out of the hospital, anyway.

13:57.529 --> 14:00.030
- You two are not...?
- No.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.788
I'm not trying to make this awkward.

14:04.856 --> 14:07.824
Why would it be? We're both adults.

14:07.892 --> 14:09.493
There's no reason we
can't work together.

14:09.561 --> 14:11.094
I'm glad you feel that way.

14:11.162 --> 14:12.329
Mario agrees?

14:13.134 --> 14:15.234
He will. Eventually.

14:15.279 --> 14:16.800
Right.

14:16.868 --> 14:18.869
Our engagement party is tonight.

14:18.937 --> 14:21.947
I only bring it up because
a few people here are going.

14:22.507 --> 14:24.575
Now it's awkward, isn't it?

14:24.642 --> 14:25.943
A little.

14:26.010 --> 14:27.678
You want to know about the two bodies

14:27.745 --> 14:29.413
that, uh, were found this morning.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.681
Yes.

14:30.748 --> 14:32.082
I've only done the
preliminary examination,

14:32.150 --> 14:35.586
but the John Doe in the acid,
his face had been removed.

14:35.653 --> 14:37.788
Removed? How?

14:37.855 --> 14:39.089
Scalpel? Razor blade?

14:39.157 --> 14:41.058
Whoever did it knew exactly
what they were doing.

14:41.125 --> 14:43.393
I'll have more for you soon.

14:43.461 --> 14:44.461
Jim.

14:45.597 --> 14:49.066
I think you made the right
decision coming back.

15:01.079 --> 15:02.379
<i>(amplified heartbeat)</i>

15:02.447 --> 15:03.647
BULLOCK (echoing): I know
this doesn't exactly look like

15:03.715 --> 15:05.816
"just business," but
right now we're thinking

15:05.883 --> 15:07.684
whoever paid Paulie Pennies
to dispose of the body

15:07.752 --> 15:09.786
(echo fades): in the bathtub,
also might have killed him

15:09.854 --> 15:11.488
- to tie up some loose ends.
- (knocking)

15:11.556 --> 15:13.190
Uh-huh.

15:14.892 --> 15:17.995
Jim. Good to see you
with a shield again.

15:18.062 --> 15:19.062
And a tie.

15:19.130 --> 15:20.397
Captain, good to be back.

15:20.465 --> 15:21.999
Bullock was just filling me in.

15:22.066 --> 15:23.927
Hell of one to catch on your first day.

15:23.961 --> 15:24.989
Yeah.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.537
That's the preliminary report from Lee.

15:27.605 --> 15:30.374
John Doe had his face removed.

15:31.421 --> 15:33.844
- Trying to cover up his identity?
- Yeah, maybe.

15:33.911 --> 15:35.545
But the acid would
have done that anyway.

15:36.614 --> 15:38.148
I'm running point on this one.

15:38.216 --> 15:40.517
- That's cool.
- Honestly, Cap...

15:41.552 --> 15:43.654
Look, I know I've been away...

15:43.721 --> 15:44.821
Maybe that's why

15:44.889 --> 15:47.257
you've forgotten how
things go around here.

15:47.325 --> 15:49.393
I give you an order and you follow it.

15:49.460 --> 15:51.795
Which, for the record,
Captain, I totally support.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.765
I'm taking point on this,
not giving you the day off.

15:54.832 --> 15:57.067
Follow the physical evidence, Bullock.

15:57.135 --> 15:58.769
Report back to me.

15:58.836 --> 16:00.804
Aye, aye.

16:00.872 --> 16:02.706
Jim.

16:06.210 --> 16:08.578
I didn't mean to bite your head off.

16:08.646 --> 16:11.948
It's just, sometimes the
ugliness here gets to me.

16:12.016 --> 16:13.016
No need to explain.

16:13.084 --> 16:14.584
Let me know if you need anything.

16:14.652 --> 16:17.020
And, uh...

16:17.088 --> 16:20.757
don't let the bastards
haze you too hard, rookie.

16:20.825 --> 16:22.759
Yes, sir.

16:23.828 --> 16:26.129
Gordon.

16:26.197 --> 16:27.764
Here's the one you wanted, Captain.

16:27.832 --> 16:30.133
Uh, mid-level felon, goes by "The Toad."

16:30.201 --> 16:33.336
Yeah, that's him. Thank you.

16:49.020 --> 16:50.654
NYGMA: <i>Maybe she's right.</i>

16:50.722 --> 16:52.923
What if there's something
about Miss Kringle's...

16:52.990 --> 16:55.759
Kristen's... Isabella's face?

16:55.827 --> 16:57.828
What if there's something
about her face that

16:57.895 --> 16:59.663
unlocks this side of me?

16:59.731 --> 17:01.765
What if I do hurt her?

17:03.668 --> 17:04.734
Oswald.

17:05.739 --> 17:07.637
- Yes?
- You're smiling.

17:08.751 --> 17:10.607
- I was?
- Yes.

17:10.675 --> 17:11.907
Oh.

17:11.976 --> 17:15.098
Well, I was just thinking...

17:16.125 --> 17:19.281
how darned lucky Isabella is.

17:19.349 --> 17:22.685
You love her, yet to protect her,

17:22.753 --> 17:25.555
you are willing to break up with her.

17:25.623 --> 17:27.156
Beautiful.

17:27.224 --> 17:29.593
Sad, but beautiful.

17:29.660 --> 17:31.308
So you think I should break up with her?

17:31.342 --> 17:34.297
I'm sorry, I thought that's
what we were talking about.

17:34.365 --> 17:35.832
Certainly, I would never pressure...

17:35.900 --> 17:37.801
No, you're right.

17:41.572 --> 17:44.007
If I did hurt her, I would
never forgive myself.

17:44.075 --> 17:46.209
(scoffs)

17:46.277 --> 17:48.278
That life would put
her in your path again,

17:48.346 --> 17:51.114
only to snatch her from you. Why?

17:51.182 --> 17:52.582
I can't do it.

17:52.650 --> 17:54.481
- What?
- I can't break up with her.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.187
But you said yourself...

17:57.255 --> 17:59.022
I need you to do it for me.

18:00.358 --> 18:01.792
Would you do that?

18:01.859 --> 18:04.728
I would be forever in your debt.

18:05.897 --> 18:07.697
Just be gentle.

18:10.835 --> 18:12.702
Of course.

18:25.783 --> 18:27.951
I'm looking for a punk who supposedly

18:28.019 --> 18:29.619
frequents this rat hole.

18:29.687 --> 18:32.756
Goes by "The Toad."

18:32.824 --> 18:34.758
MAN: Who's askin'?

18:39.297 --> 18:43.700
Captain Nathaniel Barnes of the GCPD.

18:43.768 --> 18:45.669
How about you and I go
down to the precinct,

18:45.736 --> 18:48.572
and you can answer some questions?

18:48.639 --> 18:49.773
Blow, pig.

19:04.755 --> 19:06.056
(bottle breaks)

19:06.123 --> 19:08.191
I want to know about Paulie Pennies!

19:08.259 --> 19:10.293
The body he was getting
rid of last night...

19:10.361 --> 19:12.629
Where did it come from?!

19:12.697 --> 19:15.432
Maybe you want me to
open that mouth for you.

19:15.499 --> 19:17.200
Okay, stop.

19:17.268 --> 19:18.368
I-I hired Paulie.

19:18.436 --> 19:19.870
But I'm just a go-between.

19:19.937 --> 19:22.505
I'm so sick of hearing that.

19:22.573 --> 19:24.841
No one's responsible for anything.

19:24.909 --> 19:26.042
Everyone's a middleman.

19:26.110 --> 19:27.911
I want a name!

19:27.979 --> 19:30.580
Symon, okay? Dr. Symon.

19:30.648 --> 19:33.116
He's a big-time plastic surgeon.

19:33.184 --> 19:36.753
So what, he likes cutting
people's faces off for kicks?

19:36.821 --> 19:37.988
- Try again!
- No.

19:38.055 --> 19:39.823
He's got a side business.

19:39.891 --> 19:42.292
You get in trouble, you need a new face,

19:42.360 --> 19:44.128
he gives you one.

19:44.996 --> 19:46.329
A new face?

19:46.397 --> 19:47.797
- Whose?
- I don't know.

19:47.865 --> 19:49.766
I just get rid of the
bodies, that's all.

19:49.834 --> 19:51.768
<i>(amplified heartbeat)</i>

19:55.506 --> 19:56.706
You think

19:56.774 --> 19:58.642
you're not guilty,

19:58.709 --> 19:59.809
but you are.

19:59.877 --> 20:01.077
Stop, okay, stop!

20:01.145 --> 20:03.046
It's Symon!

20:03.114 --> 20:05.749
He's the one you want.

20:05.816 --> 20:07.684
You're a cop.

20:07.752 --> 20:09.653
<i>(heartbeat fades)</i>

20:12.924 --> 20:14.190
Symon, huh?

20:15.291 --> 20:16.792
Take me to him.

20:27.619 --> 20:29.520
Mayor Cobblepot?

20:29.588 --> 20:31.923
Hello, Isabella. May I?

20:31.990 --> 20:35.459
Um, of course.

20:44.869 --> 20:45.985
Going somewhere?

20:46.104 --> 20:48.220
Just for a couple nights.

20:48.243 --> 20:50.954
But I was hoping to talk
to Ed before I left.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.927
Um, tried calling him. Is he okay?

20:54.243 --> 20:57.334
Hmm. Yes.

20:57.402 --> 20:58.936
How shall I put this?

21:01.306 --> 21:02.839
It's over.

21:03.554 --> 21:05.042
Excuse me?

21:05.109 --> 21:06.777
He is not going to see you anymore.

21:06.844 --> 21:09.079
Do not try to contact him.

21:09.147 --> 21:10.781
That door is closed.

21:11.868 --> 21:13.450
Have a nice life.

21:15.437 --> 21:17.120
(gasps)

21:18.590 --> 21:20.991
Oh, my. (sniffles)

21:21.059 --> 21:22.993
It is a shock.

21:23.061 --> 21:24.595
But besides your...

21:24.662 --> 21:27.702
odd resemblance to his ex...

21:28.466 --> 21:30.901
a certain facility with riddles...

21:32.370 --> 21:35.038
compulsion for order...

21:35.106 --> 21:37.674
what is it that you two
really have in common?

21:37.742 --> 21:40.877
Edward is a person of
exceptional intelligence

21:40.945 --> 21:42.346
and imagination.

21:42.413 --> 21:45.816
He deserves to be appreciated
by someone on his own level.

21:45.883 --> 21:47.484
And you,

21:47.552 --> 21:50.654
my dear, are simply not.

21:51.489 --> 21:53.457
Best to end things now.

21:53.524 --> 21:56.026
You're right.

21:57.495 --> 21:59.196
I don't deserve him.

21:59.263 --> 22:01.632
Glad we agree.

22:01.699 --> 22:03.200
Bye.

22:03.267 --> 22:04.758
But I'm not gonna let him go.

22:07.209 --> 22:10.123
He loves me. (sniffles) And I love him.

22:10.439 --> 22:15.212
Do you know how rare that is, Mr. Mayor?

22:18.986 --> 22:21.354
Of course you do.

22:22.689 --> 22:24.590
Because you love him, too.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.327
I can see it.

22:28.395 --> 22:31.030
(exhales) I'm not even jealous.

22:31.098 --> 22:33.499
I-I don't think that you understand...

22:33.567 --> 22:35.401
It was my glasses this morning.

22:35.469 --> 22:37.103
They reminded him of Miss Kringle.

22:37.170 --> 22:40.740
He's afraid he's going to
hurt me like he hurt her.

22:44.111 --> 22:46.779
Listen to me, you little idiot,

22:46.847 --> 22:49.315
I am telling you one last time,

22:49.383 --> 22:53.452
- let... Ed... go.
- No.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.653
I will write to him.

22:54.721 --> 22:57.590
I will make him understand
he has nothing to fear.

22:57.657 --> 23:00.026
I'm not gonna let him go.

23:01.128 --> 23:03.262
(inhales sharply)

23:03.330 --> 23:04.597
Very well.

23:05.899 --> 23:07.900
Don't say I didn't warn you.

23:11.071 --> 23:12.872
(door opens)

23:12.939 --> 23:14.040
(sighs)

23:14.107 --> 23:15.808
(door closes)

23:23.683 --> 23:25.718
You better not have been lying to me.

23:25.786 --> 23:27.820
I'm not. This is his place.

23:27.888 --> 23:30.222
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

23:31.992 --> 23:34.026
I'm trying.

23:38.613 --> 23:40.380
I'm about to take the face.

23:40.448 --> 23:42.849
Be here in an hour, and
we can do the transplant.

23:42.917 --> 23:43.883
(muffled whimpering)

23:43.951 --> 23:46.653
You haven't eaten today, have you?

23:46.721 --> 23:49.222
Very good.

23:49.290 --> 23:51.224
I have to thank you, my dear,

23:51.292 --> 23:53.593
for taking such care of your skin.

23:53.661 --> 23:56.563
Excellent elasticity.

23:56.631 --> 24:00.066
Now hold still.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.535
(muffled shouting)

24:03.871 --> 24:06.439
(door thuds)

24:06.507 --> 24:08.074
Who's there?!

24:08.142 --> 24:09.342
(muffled shouting)

24:09.410 --> 24:12.545
Quiet. Or we'll forgo any anesthesia.

24:13.447 --> 24:14.447
I said, who's there?

24:14.515 --> 24:16.449
GCPD.

24:16.517 --> 24:17.817
You're under arrest.

24:17.885 --> 24:18.985
Go for it.

24:20.588 --> 24:21.588
Please.

24:22.248 --> 24:23.615
(muffled whimpering)

24:24.817 --> 24:26.284
I surrender.

24:26.352 --> 24:28.999
Ma'am, you all right?

24:36.429 --> 24:39.698
<i>(amplified heartbeat)</i>

24:42.335 --> 24:44.136
How many?

24:44.203 --> 24:45.137
Excuse me?

24:45.204 --> 24:46.438
How many have you killed?!

24:46.506 --> 24:47.772
How many faces have you taken?

24:49.642 --> 24:52.077
I have the right to an attorney.

24:52.145 --> 24:53.845
I wish to invoke

24:53.913 --> 24:55.547
that right... now.

24:55.615 --> 24:58.984
BARNES' VOICE (distorted):
<i>Guilty.Guilty.</i>

24:59.051 --> 25:01.086
Who's there?! <i>Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.</i>

25:01.154 --> 25:03.522
No one. It's only me.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.924
BARNES' VOICE (distorted):
<i>Guilty. He's guilty! Guilty.</i>

25:05.992 --> 25:08.660
- <i>Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.</i>
- What is wrong with you?

25:08.728 --> 25:10.595
- <i>He's guilty. Guilty.</i>
- (groaning)

25:13.432 --> 25:14.833
<i>(heart beating faster)</i>

25:14.901 --> 25:16.034
What are you doing?

25:16.102 --> 25:17.569
Arrest me.

25:17.637 --> 25:20.639
BARNES' VOICE (distorted):
<i>Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.</i>

25:20.706 --> 25:22.908
- I'm not resisting!
- <i>Guilty!</i>

25:22.975 --> 25:25.310
<i>Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!</i>

25:25.378 --> 25:27.112
<i>Guilty. He's guilty.</i>

25:27.180 --> 25:29.614
<i>Guilty.</i>

25:31.884 --> 25:33.852
LUCIUS: The point Dr.
Thompkins hopes you pay

25:33.920 --> 25:36.688
particular attention to is
the level of strength required

25:36.756 --> 25:41.179
to sever Paulie Pennie"
head from his torso.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.195
And what level would that be, Lucius?

25:43.262 --> 25:44.449
Extreme.

25:44.505 --> 25:46.345
Extreme strength. Got it.

25:46.390 --> 25:49.100
As for the other victim in the
bathtub, we haven't gotten any hits

25:49.168 --> 25:51.703
on his prints, but a puncture
mark in his arm suggests

25:51.771 --> 25:54.673
he was drugged prior to
having his face removed.

25:54.740 --> 25:57.008
I'll run toxicology, I'll let
you know what I come up with.

25:57.076 --> 25:58.143
Thanks, Lucius.

25:58.211 --> 25:59.411
Yep.

25:59.478 --> 26:01.769
It's good to have you back, Gordon.

26:02.481 --> 26:04.683
Lucius, you're in
forensics, not the M.E.

26:04.750 --> 26:07.747
Is there a reason Lee
didn't bring this herself?

26:08.521 --> 26:11.122
Dr. Thompkins has
already gone for the day.

26:11.190 --> 26:12.724
Her engagement party.

26:13.686 --> 26:15.390
Right.

26:15.435 --> 26:17.796
I hear it's gonna be quite the affair.

26:17.863 --> 26:18.997
Beautiful women,

26:19.065 --> 26:21.233
free booze, canapés.

26:21.300 --> 26:23.197
- Harvey, you can go if you want.
- Oh, no.

26:23.254 --> 26:25.470
I'd much rather spend time
here with my old partner.

26:25.538 --> 26:27.105
Much more fun.

26:27.173 --> 26:29.007
Besides,

26:29.075 --> 26:30.141
I wasn't invited.

26:30.209 --> 26:31.443
(chuckles softly)

26:33.380 --> 26:34.880
Captain!

26:34.948 --> 26:36.749
BARNES: Bullock, book this
piece of human garbage

26:36.816 --> 26:38.751
for the murder of John Doe.

26:38.818 --> 26:40.719
You got it, Captain. Come on.

26:42.522 --> 26:43.689
Plastic surgeon.

26:43.757 --> 26:45.424
Face man for the underworld.

26:46.493 --> 26:48.293
He had a girl on the table.

26:48.361 --> 26:50.329
If I had been there
five minutes later...

26:50.397 --> 26:51.430
But you weren't.

26:51.498 --> 26:53.332
You did it, Captain.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.034
Yeah.

26:55.101 --> 26:56.335
Today.

26:59.539 --> 27:02.041
You know that feeling, Jim,
when you've won the battle

27:02.108 --> 27:04.076
but you know you're gonna lose the war?

27:05.389 --> 27:08.113
Wars are fought one
battle at a time, sir.

27:11.441 --> 27:13.452
You said he killed the John Doe?

27:13.520 --> 27:16.088
- Not Paulie Pennies?
- No.

27:16.156 --> 27:17.890
His killer's still out there.

27:18.817 --> 27:20.592
I'll get him tomorrow.

27:20.660 --> 27:21.834
Promise.

27:26.299 --> 27:27.800
(door closes)

28:09.564 --> 28:13.467
My father and I haven't
always seen eye to eye.

28:13.535 --> 28:15.569
(laughter)

28:15.637 --> 28:18.903
But I think, Dad, you'll agree that...

28:19.795 --> 28:22.685
marrying Lee is the best
decision I've ever made.

28:22.786 --> 28:25.088
- Without a doubt.
- (laughter)

28:25.155 --> 28:27.056
And Lee.

28:27.124 --> 28:29.726
You're a doctor, a member of our city's

28:29.793 --> 28:32.028
police department.

28:32.096 --> 28:35.665
You're funny, compassionate
and brilliant.

28:35.733 --> 28:39.068
Despite insisting all dogs are boys

28:39.136 --> 28:42.171
and all cats are girls... (laughter)

28:42.239 --> 28:44.855
it's hopeless, I've
tried to correct her...

28:46.310 --> 28:49.011
I've loved you since
the moment I saw you.

28:49.079 --> 28:51.147
(crowd aahing)

28:51.215 --> 28:54.317
(applause, whooping)

28:58.222 --> 29:00.390
So wonderful.

29:00.457 --> 29:02.325
BARBARA: Lee.

29:02.393 --> 29:04.540
Congrats.

29:05.028 --> 29:07.029
You look gorgeous. No surprise.

29:07.097 --> 29:08.631
- Barbara. How did you...
- Get in?

29:08.699 --> 29:11.134
As a plus one. With that guy there.

29:11.201 --> 29:12.435
Hey.

29:12.503 --> 29:13.603
Or it might have been him.

29:13.670 --> 29:15.638
You need to leave, right now.

29:15.706 --> 29:17.173
Can't we bury the hatchet?

29:17.241 --> 29:20.543
So I came at you with a knife,
kidnapped you, whatever.

29:20.611 --> 29:22.445
I've forgiven you for
beating me unconscious.

29:22.513 --> 29:23.746
Water under the bridge.

29:23.814 --> 29:25.281
You just stay right here,
I'm gonna get someone.

29:25.349 --> 29:27.040
I'm leaving.

29:27.918 --> 29:29.886
Just wanted to ask.

29:29.953 --> 29:32.722
As someone else who was
once with Jim Gordon,

29:32.790 --> 29:34.290
don't you miss it?

29:34.358 --> 29:35.591
Miss what?

29:35.659 --> 29:37.860
The heat.

29:37.928 --> 29:42.598
Being so close to so
much darkness and light,

29:42.666 --> 29:44.934
to someone always at war with himself.

29:45.002 --> 29:47.236
Let me think... Tormented Jim Gordon,

29:47.304 --> 29:51.207
or Mario, who I know is a good man,

29:51.275 --> 29:53.342
who'll be a wonderful
father to my children,

29:53.410 --> 29:54.710
and whom I love.

29:54.778 --> 29:58.047
No. I don't miss it.

29:58.115 --> 29:59.248
Wow.

29:59.316 --> 30:01.484
I think you actually believe that.

30:01.552 --> 30:03.619
(laughs) It's kind of sad.

30:03.687 --> 30:06.923
Tell my dates I've left, would you?

30:09.226 --> 30:10.293
Uh-uh.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.495
- Don't let her ruin your night.
- (sighs)

30:12.563 --> 30:14.430
Captain. I'm so glad you came.

30:14.498 --> 30:16.666
I-I can't stay.

30:16.733 --> 30:18.641
I came to congratulate you.

30:18.969 --> 30:20.570
You deserve to be happy.

30:20.637 --> 30:22.071
Thank you.

30:22.139 --> 30:24.207
But you have to stay
for at least one drink.

30:24.274 --> 30:25.174
If nothing else,

30:25.242 --> 30:27.777
to save me from these people.

30:27.845 --> 30:29.445
One drink.

30:29.513 --> 30:31.647
- But no work talk.
- Deal.

30:33.350 --> 30:36.018
So, among the materials
confiscated in Symon's lab,

30:36.086 --> 30:39.188
I came across a unique
anesthetic cocktail.

30:39.256 --> 30:40.556
Let me guess.

30:40.624 --> 30:43.059
The same cocktail toxicology
found in the John Doe.

30:43.126 --> 30:44.594
Exactly.

30:44.661 --> 30:47.912
Hey. I got some bad news.

30:47.969 --> 30:50.102
- Symon walked.
- What?

30:50.136 --> 30:52.568
The girl he had tied up
refused to press charges.

30:52.636 --> 30:53.836
They probably paid her off.

30:53.904 --> 30:56.506
And we just got an
order from Judge Bam-Bam

30:56.573 --> 30:59.014
demanding his immediate release.

30:59.070 --> 31:01.927
The Botox son of a
bitch is uber-connected.

31:02.051 --> 31:05.336
The toxicology definitely ties
Symon to the John Doe murder.

31:05.849 --> 31:08.351
We got to get him back here.

31:12.289 --> 31:13.956
Captain Barnes?

31:15.859 --> 31:17.393
Carmine Falcone.

31:17.461 --> 31:19.195
I don't believe we've met.

31:19.263 --> 31:20.663
No.

31:20.731 --> 31:23.266
But I was just leaving.

31:23.333 --> 31:24.634
I see.

31:24.701 --> 31:26.802
Is my company so odious?

31:26.870 --> 31:28.404
You belong behind bars.

31:28.472 --> 31:30.439
I'm retired.

31:30.507 --> 31:34.243
After running Gotham's
underworld for 30 years.

31:36.113 --> 31:38.748
This city was built
because of men like me.

31:38.815 --> 31:40.983
People have jobs because of men like me.

31:41.051 --> 31:43.386
That whiskey you're drinking?

31:43.453 --> 31:44.887
Paid for through my work.

31:44.955 --> 31:47.857
So you did some good. So what?

31:47.925 --> 31:49.926
Doesn't mean you're above the law.

31:49.993 --> 31:51.327
Nobody is.

31:51.395 --> 31:53.663
You know, whenever I hear a man

31:53.730 --> 31:55.498
possessed of such certainty,

31:55.566 --> 31:59.168
I always think he's trying
mostly to convince himself.

32:01.104 --> 32:03.940
I wish you a pleasant evening, Captain.

32:21.491 --> 32:22.858
(line ringing)

32:22.926 --> 32:24.193
ALVAREZ: Hey, Captain.

32:24.261 --> 32:25.595
Alvarez.

32:25.662 --> 32:27.997
Tell Gordon I'm bringing
him the man responsible

32:28.065 --> 32:30.466
for Paulie Pennies' murder.

32:30.930 --> 32:32.063
No backup.

32:32.131 --> 32:34.032
He's coming in of his own accord.

32:34.100 --> 32:35.500
Sure thing, Captain.

32:35.568 --> 32:38.770
But you should know, the
judge released Dr. Symon.

32:38.838 --> 32:39.904
Captain?

32:39.972 --> 32:41.172
(phone clicks shut)

32:41.240 --> 32:43.375
BARNES' VOICE (distorted): <i>Guilty.</i>

32:43.442 --> 32:45.810
<i>Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.</i>

32:45.878 --> 32:47.545
<i>Guilty. Guilty.</i>

32:47.613 --> 32:48.346
<i>Guilty!</i>

32:48.414 --> 32:50.882
<i>Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.</i>

32:50.950 --> 32:52.984
<i>Guilty! Guilty.</i>

32:53.052 --> 32:54.719
Guilty.

33:03.530 --> 33:04.696
(knocks softly)

33:04.764 --> 33:06.965
Isabella.

33:11.104 --> 33:13.238
Isabella, I got your note.

33:15.408 --> 33:18.577
I thought you needed to
leave for your conference.

33:18.645 --> 33:20.709
ISABELLA: I can be late, Edward.

33:26.085 --> 33:28.207
This is more important.

33:31.090 --> 33:33.225
Oswa... (clears throat)

33:34.994 --> 33:37.062
Oswald...

33:37.130 --> 33:39.731
the mayor, he informed me
of your position, um...

33:39.799 --> 33:43.969
but believe me, I-I think...
our breaking up is for the best.

33:44.037 --> 33:47.272
No, Edward, it's not.

33:47.340 --> 33:51.771
I understand your fear. It
comes from a place of love.

33:51.978 --> 33:54.646
I know you won't hurt me.

33:56.683 --> 33:58.817
You never could.

33:58.885 --> 34:00.786
I don't think that you...

34:00.854 --> 34:02.487
(gasps)

34:02.555 --> 34:05.457
Oh, my...

34:05.525 --> 34:07.226
Kristen.

34:07.293 --> 34:10.295
I found old photos in newspapers.

34:10.362 --> 34:12.664
You have to... I need to leave now.

34:12.732 --> 34:13.998
No, no, no, no, no.

34:14.067 --> 34:15.801
No, no, no, no. Look at me.

34:15.869 --> 34:17.034
Look at me!

34:17.103 --> 34:18.437
You don't know what you're doing.

34:18.504 --> 34:21.139
I am forcing you to face your fear.

34:21.206 --> 34:23.308
You won't hurt me, even
when I look like this.

34:23.376 --> 34:25.210
Edward. (inhales sharply)

34:25.277 --> 34:27.346
(whispers): Edward.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.114
(panting softly)

34:30.049 --> 34:31.550
(exhales)

34:39.092 --> 34:40.092
(quietly): No, no, no, no.

34:40.159 --> 34:42.594
No, no, no, no, no.

34:49.936 --> 34:52.641
(choking): Edward.

35:00.713 --> 35:02.915
Should I take the glasses off?

35:02.982 --> 35:04.650
Keep them on.

35:13.523 --> 35:16.392
Seal off the exits, but do it quietly.

35:16.459 --> 35:17.660
Last thing anyone wants

35:17.727 --> 35:19.428
- is a scene.
- OFFICER: Yes, sir.

35:19.496 --> 35:20.562
Little late for that.

35:20.630 --> 35:22.698
What are you doing here?

35:22.766 --> 35:24.733
I'm sorry, but we have to make an arrest

35:24.801 --> 35:26.802
in the Paulie Pennies
case. We tried to get

35:26.870 --> 35:28.370
the guy at home, but his housekeeper

35:28.438 --> 35:29.738
said he was here. Just makes you realize

35:29.806 --> 35:31.440
what a small town Gotham is, doesn't it?

35:31.508 --> 35:32.875
Couldn't you wait?

35:32.942 --> 35:34.443
If he's here, he's not exactly running.

35:34.511 --> 35:36.045
She makes a good point, Jim.

35:36.112 --> 35:37.413
You want to take that one?

35:37.480 --> 35:38.747
Good evening, everyone.

35:39.453 --> 35:41.917
Jim. What's going on?

35:41.985 --> 35:44.653
Apparently, there's a murder
suspect among our guests.

35:44.721 --> 35:45.821
Can I ask who?

35:45.889 --> 35:47.556
Dr. Maxwell Symon.

35:47.624 --> 35:49.458
- He's a...
- Plastic surgeon.

35:49.526 --> 35:51.126
You arrest him, you're
gonna have to fight off

35:51.194 --> 35:52.294
every woman here.

35:52.362 --> 35:53.495
He's a favorite.

35:53.563 --> 35:55.798
He's also a murderer.

35:55.865 --> 35:58.434
I'd be curious to know
how your father knows him.

35:58.501 --> 35:59.868
I'm sure that their relationship

35:59.936 --> 36:01.870
is completely above board.

36:01.938 --> 36:04.573
While you two hash this out,
I'm gonna go grab Symon.

36:04.641 --> 36:06.975
- GORDON: Harvey.
- What? I can handle

36:07.043 --> 36:07.976
a plastic surgeon on my own.

36:08.044 --> 36:09.244
And don't worry,

36:09.312 --> 36:11.347
discretion is my middle name.

36:13.817 --> 36:16.418
Lee, I'd like a word with Jim.

36:16.486 --> 36:18.420
- Mario...
- It'll be fine.

36:18.488 --> 36:20.589
(quietly): Okay.

36:33.837 --> 36:36.572
Look, Mario, I have a job to do,

36:36.639 --> 36:38.340
so whatever this is...

36:38.408 --> 36:40.275
When you told Tetch to kill Lee,

36:40.343 --> 36:41.877
you knew he would do the opposite.

36:41.945 --> 36:45.481
You sacrificed your
girlfriend for my fiancée.

36:45.548 --> 36:46.382
That's insane.

36:46.449 --> 36:48.550
Can we just admit you still love her?

36:49.530 --> 36:51.220
- I don't have time for this.
- Hey.

36:52.226 --> 36:54.957
You once told me that
if I ever hurt Lee,

36:55.024 --> 36:55.924
you'd kill me.

36:55.992 --> 36:57.326
Well, now it's my turn.

36:57.971 --> 36:59.962
I love Lee and I'll do

37:00.029 --> 37:02.131
whatever I have to to keep her.

37:02.198 --> 37:03.565
Then word of advice...

37:04.434 --> 37:06.969
lose the jealousy.

37:07.036 --> 37:08.370
It's weak.

37:10.006 --> 37:11.686
Gordon.

37:16.045 --> 37:17.980
(spits)

37:20.784 --> 37:23.519
For Lee, I'll give you that one.

37:28.925 --> 37:30.459
(door closes)

37:40.703 --> 37:43.839
Oh, Captain... if you
keep frowning like that,

37:43.907 --> 37:46.341
you'll never get those
wrinkles out around your mouth.

37:47.544 --> 37:49.745
Come down to my office tomorrow.

37:51.059 --> 37:52.881
I'll give you a free evaluation.

38:00.256 --> 38:01.557
I'm surprised you can feel that

38:01.624 --> 38:03.258
through that thing you call a face.

38:03.326 --> 38:04.726
What are you doing?!

38:04.794 --> 38:07.229
What I should have done all along.

38:11.968 --> 38:13.802
You're insane.

38:14.016 --> 38:15.471
Oh, no, Doc.

38:15.538 --> 38:17.973
I'm saner than I've ever been.

38:18.041 --> 38:21.076
I'm seeing things clearly...

38:21.144 --> 38:23.979
for the very first time.

38:24.047 --> 38:26.448
All these years, I've put
my trust in the system,

38:26.516 --> 38:29.551
my trust in the law, held myself back

38:29.619 --> 38:32.267
from doing what I really wanted to do.

38:34.190 --> 38:36.291
And then I saw the truth.

38:36.359 --> 38:38.694
It's not just you that's guilty.

38:40.630 --> 38:42.931
This whole city is guilty.

38:42.999 --> 38:43.932
Stop.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.234
(choking)

38:45.301 --> 38:48.725
You're a police officer, for God's sake!

38:49.098 --> 38:50.939
You have to follow the law.

38:51.007 --> 38:52.908
I don't have to do anything.

38:52.976 --> 38:54.243
I am the law.

38:54.310 --> 38:56.845
I am judge...

38:56.913 --> 38:57.813
(grunts)

38:57.881 --> 38:58.981
jury...

38:59.048 --> 38:59.948
(grunts)

39:00.016 --> 39:02.718
and executioner!

39:02.785 --> 39:05.387
(screaming)

39:05.455 --> 39:07.589
(car horn blaring)

39:30.719 --> 39:32.616
Ed.

39:33.917 --> 39:35.889
- How'd she take it?
- What?

39:35.957 --> 39:38.225
Oh. Uh, um... everything is...

39:38.293 --> 39:39.393
(inhales)

39:39.461 --> 39:40.627
wonderful.

39:40.695 --> 39:43.096
Isabella showed me that, uh...

39:43.683 --> 39:45.532
I was worried over nothing.

39:52.692 --> 39:54.942
I'm so happy for you.

39:55.009 --> 39:57.135
But... why are you back?

39:57.203 --> 39:58.812
Well, she had to go to her conference.

39:58.880 --> 40:00.147
I insisted.

40:00.215 --> 40:02.082
You're a good man.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.817
But you look done in.

40:03.885 --> 40:05.953
I will hear all about it tomorrow.

40:06.020 --> 40:07.955
Get some sleep.

40:20.201 --> 40:23.003
Got to give her credit.

40:23.071 --> 40:25.372
She fought for him.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.841
Too bad she underestimated her opponent.

40:29.244 --> 40:31.145
I'm assuming it's done.

40:31.212 --> 40:32.646
Yup.

40:32.714 --> 40:34.448
Feel kind of bad, though, boss.

40:34.516 --> 40:37.151
I always liked librarians.

40:37.218 --> 40:38.952
You?

40:39.020 --> 40:40.598
What about poor Ed?

40:42.257 --> 40:44.391
He will be heartbroken.

40:46.728 --> 40:49.696
Luckily, he has a shoulder to cry on.

40:50.732 --> 40:53.667
(humming)

40:56.104 --> 40:58.572
(bell dinging)

41:00.542 --> 41:02.709
(train horn blowing)

41:04.712 --> 41:06.547
Uh-oh. Come on. No, no.

41:09.284 --> 41:11.118
Oh, come on. Uh-oh.

41:12.554 --> 41:14.922
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

41:14.989 --> 41:16.323
Help me, help me! Somebody, help!

41:16.391 --> 41:18.559
- (train horn blaring)
- Oh, dear.

41:18.626 --> 41:20.594
<i>(metal crashing, glass shattering)</i>

41:24.999 --> 41:27.734
Jim, you and Mario
have a heart-to-heart?

41:27.802 --> 41:30.103
- Yeah. Where's Symon?
- No luck.

41:30.171 --> 41:31.713
He must have skedaddled.

41:32.974 --> 41:34.508
I thought he might be at the bar.

41:34.576 --> 41:35.609
Uh-huh. Okay.

41:35.677 --> 41:37.511
Keep a perimeter in
case he shows back up.

41:37.579 --> 41:39.313
I'm gonna head to his house.

41:39.380 --> 41:42.360
And, Harvey, uh... take it easy, huh?

41:42.405 --> 41:44.484
It's good to have you back again, Jim.

41:44.552 --> 41:46.157
- Uh-huh.
- I'm real glad.

41:48.623 --> 41:49.623
Captain.

41:49.691 --> 41:51.767
- Did you hear?
- Everything.

41:52.158 --> 41:53.493
I saw Symon here earlier.

41:53.561 --> 41:54.795
You manage to pick him up?

41:54.863 --> 41:57.329
Not yet. He must've skipped
out when we showed up.

41:57.386 --> 41:58.435
We'll get him.

41:58.447 --> 42:01.458
Alvarez said you were bringing in
the guy who did Paulie Pennies.

42:01.876 --> 42:03.670
Turned out to be a dead end.

42:04.743 --> 42:06.640
I'll let you know when I find Symon.

42:06.708 --> 42:08.275
Jim.

42:08.343 --> 42:11.330
Things are gonna change around here.

42:11.635 --> 42:14.169
You and I are gonna make
a difference in this city.

42:14.892 --> 42:17.050
We're gonna clean it up.

42:18.384 --> 42:19.637
Yes, sir.

42:33.268 --> 42:37.404
BARNES' VOICE (distorted):
<i>Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.</i>

42:37.472 --> 42:38.972
- <i>Guilty. Guilty.</i>
- (laughter)

42:39.040 --> 42:41.108
<i>Guilty!</i>

42:41.175 --> 42:43.677
<i>Guilty! Guilty!</i>

42:43.745 --> 42:45.379
- <i>Guilty.</i>
- (laughter continues)

42:45.446 --> 42:46.546
<i>Guilty.</i>

42:46.614 --> 42:49.316
<i>Guilty.Guilty.</i>

42:57.160 --> 42:59.249
GCPD. Sir?

43:05.060 --> 43:06.607
Dr. Symon.

43:09.113 --> 43:10.332
Who did this?

43:15.214 --> 43:16.737
Barnes.

43:17.305 --> 43:23.297
