WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.203
HEY, WILL.

00:02.203 --> 00:04.175
WANTED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,
BUT WE FORGOT.

00:04.175 --> 00:05.536
OKAY. THANKS FOR COMING.

00:05.536 --> 00:06.537
NO, WAIT.

00:06.537 --> 00:07.678
WAS IT ABOUT HIS HAIR?

00:07.678 --> 00:09.110
YES, YOU ALREADY TOLD ME

00:09.110 --> 00:10.481
THAT MY HAIR LOOKS
LIKE THAT CHOCOLATE TOPPING

00:10.481 --> 00:12.583
THAT HARDENS
WHEN YOU PUT IT ON ICE CREAM.

00:12.583 --> 00:14.085
(laughs) IT TOTALLY DOES.

00:14.085 --> 00:15.146
OUR BUSINESS HERE IS DONE.

00:15.146 --> 00:17.348
WAIT. I KNOW WHAT IT WAS--
TRANS AM.

00:17.348 --> 00:19.690
RIGHT.MY TRANS AM'S
BEEN ACTING UP AGAIN.

00:19.690 --> 00:21.422
I GOTTA TAKE IT INTO THE SHOP.

00:21.422 --> 00:24.425
IT'S LURCHING AND SPUTTERING
AND MAKING WEIRD NOISES.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.627
SOUNDS LIKE ME
WHEN I TRY TO DANCE.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.730
WHOA, WILL.
LOVE YOURSELF, MAN.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.562
YOU NEED TO FOLLOW ME
TO THE GARAGE.
(fingers snap)

00:31.562 --> 00:33.364
CRAIG, YOU NEED
TO BRING THE BOOTY MUG.

00:33.364 --> 00:36.207
THE BOOTY MUG?
YOU STILL USE THAT THING?

00:36.207 --> 00:39.240
'COURSE. GIVES ME STREET CRED
WITH GUYS WHO DO MANLY JOBS.

00:40.471 --> 00:42.573
(sighs)
THE PIPES ARE CORRODED.

00:42.573 --> 00:44.315
IT'S GONNA COST YOU
1,000 BUCKS.

00:44.315 --> 00:46.077
1,000?

00:46.077 --> 00:48.119
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT, CHIEF?

00:48.119 --> 00:51.622
YOU SEEM LIKE A PRETTY GOOD GUY.
I CAN PROBABLY DO IT FOR $200.

00:51.622 --> 00:53.384
ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA GO
LOOK AT SOME "PLAYBOYS."

00:53.384 --> 00:54.385
CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

00:54.385 --> 00:56.127
YOU GOT IT.

00:56.127 --> 00:57.628
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
THAT MUG CAN'T DO.

00:57.628 --> 01:00.161
KENNY, YOU SHOULD JUST
WORK ON YOUR CAR YOURSELF.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.093
THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE THE SATISFACTION

01:02.093 --> 01:04.064
OF FIXING SOMETHING
WITH YOUR OWN HANDS.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.138
OH, WILL, YOU KNOW
I HAVE NO MECHANICAL SKILLS.

01:07.138 --> 01:09.770
MY ONLY TRUE SKILLS ARE
LICK-BATHING MYSELF LIKE A CAT

01:09.770 --> 01:11.572
AND SHAKE-DRYING MYSELF
LIKE A DOG.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.673
ONE TIME
I WALKED IN ON YOU

01:12.673 --> 01:14.645
TAKING A BATH
BELLY-DOWN LIKE A SEAL.

01:14.645 --> 01:17.178
KEEPS MY BUTT-TOCKS COOL.

01:21.852 --> 01:22.853
SO...

01:22.853 --> 01:24.455
I'VE GOT NEWS.

01:24.455 --> 01:26.857
GRANT AND I ARE THINKING
OF MOVING IN TOGETHER.

01:26.857 --> 01:29.220
REALLY?
WELL, THAT IS GREAT.

01:29.220 --> 01:31.192
I GOT TO SAY, THIS IS
THE HEALTHIEST RELATIONSHIP

01:31.192 --> 01:32.663
THAT YOU HAVE EVER HAD.

01:32.663 --> 01:36.367
BUT FIRST I WANT TO PROVOKE HIM
INTO HAVING A BIG, UGLY FIGHT.

01:36.367 --> 01:37.568
AW, THERE'S THE GIRL I KNOW.

01:37.568 --> 01:39.130
IT'S JUST, WE'VE NEVER FOUGHT,

01:39.130 --> 01:41.402
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THAT'S LIKE BEFORE I COMMIT.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.134
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE,
THERESA SAYS,

01:43.134 --> 01:45.105
NOT MEANING IT,
BUT TRYING TO BE SUPPORTIVE.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.237
WHEN I WAS WITH KENNY,

01:46.237 --> 01:48.279
FIGHTING WAS THE WORST THING
ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE--

01:48.279 --> 01:49.480
THAT, AND SLEEPING WITH HIM

01:49.480 --> 01:51.682
WAS LIKE BEING STEAMROLLED
BY A BAG OF ELBOWS.

01:51.682 --> 01:53.384
WELL, GOOD LUCK
GETTING GRANT TO FIGHT.

01:53.384 --> 01:55.886
IT'D BE EASIER TO GET
A RAINBOW TO FLIP YOU OFF.

01:55.886 --> 01:59.250
I KNOW. THE MAN HAS
NO BUTTONS TO PUSH.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.793
THIS ONE, HOWEVER, IS ALL
BUTTONS. HEY, KENNY.SHMERMI.

02:02.793 --> 02:05.756
SHMERMI?WHAT THE HELL DOES
THAT MEAN? YOU'RE RELENTLESS!

02:05.756 --> 02:06.797
(laughs)

02:06.797 --> 02:08.799
YOU GUYS READY TO GO?

02:08.799 --> 02:11.262
SHUT UP, BRO.

02:11.262 --> 02:14.505
DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
THAT WAS THE BOOTY MUG TALKIN'.

02:14.505 --> 02:15.666
SINCE YOU'RE FOLLOWING ME
TO THE MECHANIC'S,

02:15.666 --> 02:17.768
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT SOMETHING CLEAR AND STICKY

02:17.768 --> 02:19.610
IS SPEWING OUT
OF THE TRANS AM'S TAILPIPE.

02:19.610 --> 02:22.142
IT ISOUTRAGEOUSLYFLAMMABLE,
SO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.144
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU KEEP
THAT PIECE OF JUNK, KENNY.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.446
I STILL THINK
DAD ONLY GAVE IT TO YOU

02:25.446 --> 02:26.877
AS PUNISHMENT
FOR QUITTING FOOTBALL.

02:26.877 --> 02:28.349
UH, I DIDN'T QUIT FOOTBALL.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.181
I WAS THROWN OFF THE TEAM
FOR CRYING,

02:30.181 --> 02:31.852
AND THAT CAR'S
JUST A LITTLE QUIRKY.

02:31.852 --> 02:35.556
NO, IT'S A GIANT QUIRK
THAT'S A LITTLE CAR-Y.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.288
I WORKED ON IT WITH DAD
WHEN WE WERE KIDS, KENNY.

02:37.288 --> 02:38.559
I SHOULD KNOW.
LET IT DIE ALREADY.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.561
IT'S JUST SHOWING ITS AGE.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.893
WHO HERE AMONG US HASN'T,
AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIVES,

02:42.893 --> 02:45.336
SPEWED A CLEAR,
FLAMMABLE LIQUID?

02:48.239 --> 02:50.170
OH, MY GOD.
AM I THE ONLY ONE?

02:51.742 --> 02:53.874
(whirring)

02:53.874 --> 02:55.346
COMPRESSION'S
OUT OF WHACK,

02:55.346 --> 02:57.648
RINGS ARE SHOT,
TIMING BELT NEEDS REPLACING.

02:57.648 --> 02:59.350
I'M GONNA NOD
LIKE I UNDERSTAND,

02:59.350 --> 03:01.382
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:01.382 --> 03:04.184
ALL RIGHT, TRY THIS--$5,000.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.286
(exhales deeply)

03:05.286 --> 03:06.917
CRAIG? BOOTY? DO SOMETHING.

03:06.917 --> 03:10.761
UH, YOU SURE ABOUT
THAT NUMBER, BIG DOG?

03:10.761 --> 03:13.324
YOU SEEM LIKE A GOOD GUY.

03:13.324 --> 03:14.725
CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THE MONEY,

03:14.725 --> 03:16.767
BUT I'D LOVE TO GO BOWLING
WITH YOU SOMETIME.

03:16.767 --> 03:18.599
(sighs)
NO!

03:18.599 --> 03:20.731
KENNY, COME HERE.

03:20.731 --> 03:21.832
(drilling in distance)

03:21.832 --> 03:24.805
WE CAN TOTALLY
FIX YOUR TRANS AM OURSELVES.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.408
I HAVE TONS OF CAR TOOLS--
LIFTS, GAUGES,

03:27.408 --> 03:29.780
UH, ONE OF THOSE WRENCHES,
UH, WHAT'S IT CALLED?

03:29.780 --> 03:31.312
UH, GOES...
(makes clicking sound)

03:31.312 --> 03:32.483
YOU'RE NOT
INSPIRING CONFIDENCE.

03:32.483 --> 03:33.844
RATCHET.

03:33.844 --> 03:36.487
YES, THEY'RE FILTHY ANIMALS,
BUT HOW DOES THAT HELP US?

03:36.487 --> 03:39.219
KENNY, I FIX STUFF
AROUND THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.652
COME ON.
WE CAN TOTALLY DO THIS.

03:41.652 --> 03:45.456
OKAY, WILL.
I WILL FIX THIS CAR WITH YOU.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.860
TINY LITTLE BABY LIPS.

03:51.001 --> 03:52.263
I'M SORRY.

03:52.263 --> 03:54.305
THERE WAS A LOT OF FUMES
IN THE TRANS AM ON THE WAY OVER.

03:56.006 --> 03:57.938
(beeping)
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE
WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE

03:57.938 --> 04:00.841
IS SOME OF THOSE STEEL-BELTED
SONS OF BITCHES, HUH?

04:00.841 --> 04:02.743
(thump)

04:02.743 --> 04:05.015
HEY. NICE MUG.

04:05.015 --> 04:08.549
OH, NO. IT'S JUST AN IRONIC
ANTI-OBJECTIFICATION--

04:08.549 --> 04:10.921
NO, SERIOUSLY, I LOVE IT.
(chuckles) IT'S FUNNY.

04:10.921 --> 04:14.355
IT'S GREAT TO SEE A GUY
WHO'S NOT AFRAID TO BE A GUY.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.858
I'M BECKY. (chuckles)

04:17.858 --> 04:19.960
I'M CRAIG.

04:21.592 --> 04:23.464
SO TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.366
OH, WAIT,
I'M NOT INTERESTED...

04:25.366 --> 04:26.697
BECAUSE I'M A GUY.

04:30.341 --> 04:32.843
(sighs)
I'M TAKING OUT THE RECYCLING.

04:32.843 --> 04:33.944
MM.

04:35.576 --> 04:39.380
I'LL DO IT.
IT'S MY HOUSE.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.953
(clatters)

04:42.953 --> 04:44.815
BUT, BRENDA, THAT'S RECYCLING.

04:44.815 --> 04:46.357
(plate clatters)

04:46.357 --> 04:47.358
YEAH,
BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING,

04:47.358 --> 04:49.390
WHO REALLY CARES
ABOUT THE PLANET?

04:49.390 --> 04:50.721
AS LONG AS IT HOLDS UP
TILL I'M DEAD,

04:50.721 --> 04:53.864
SCREW THE NEXT GENERATION.

05:00.431 --> 05:04.475
(vacuum whirring)

05:04.475 --> 05:06.407
SO GRANT CLEANS
WHEN HE GETS MAD?

05:06.407 --> 05:07.538
I KNOW. ISN'T THAT WEIRD?

05:07.538 --> 05:10.411
HE'S HANDSOME, CHARMING,
AND NOW THIS.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.642
IF YOU TELL ME
THAT NAGGING MAKES HIM HORNY,

05:11.642 --> 05:13.013
I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.586
THE GUY'S EVEN IRONING
MY SHEETS. I FEEL LIKE THE POPE.

05:16.987 --> 05:18.619
FOR SOME REASON,
I'VE ALWAYS IMAGINED THAT

05:18.619 --> 05:20.991
THE POPE HAS A HOT BLACK GUY
THAT IRONS HIS SHEETS.

05:20.991 --> 05:23.323
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO FINDING OUT
IF YOU SHOULD MOVE IN TOGETHER?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.325
YEAH, I'M PUTTING THAT
ON THE BACK BURNER,

05:25.325 --> 05:27.458
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
IS VERY CLEAN.

05:27.458 --> 05:28.729
(door opens)

05:28.729 --> 05:30.801
UNCLE KENNY AND DADDY
ARE ARGUING IN THE GARAGE.

05:30.801 --> 05:32.002
THEY SAID
I COULD HAVE ICE CREAM

05:32.002 --> 05:34.104
IF I DIDN'T TELL YOU
THE BAD WORDS THEY SAID.

05:34.104 --> 05:35.806
CHOCOLATE, PLEASE.

05:35.806 --> 05:38.709
(sighs)

05:38.709 --> 05:40.641
HOW CAN YOU MIX UP MY CAR PARTS
WITH PIECES OFYOUR LAWN MOWER?!

05:40.641 --> 05:43.444
I JUST PUT A FEW PIECES
IN THE WRONG PILE, OKAY?

05:43.444 --> 05:44.815
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, KENNY.

05:44.815 --> 05:46.977
WHO'S THE ONE WHO GOT
THE MASTER CYLINDER OUT?

05:46.977 --> 05:49.520
WE DIDN'T NEED TO TAKE
THE MASTER CYLINDER OUT!

05:49.520 --> 05:50.451
OH, YEAH? WELL, THEN,
HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED

05:50.451 --> 05:51.922
TO GET TO THE SCREWDRIVER
THAT I DROPPED?!

05:51.922 --> 05:53.384
YEAH,
THIS LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT.

05:53.384 --> 05:54.785
BOYS, WHY DON'T YOU
CONSIDER THIS THE AUTOPSY

05:54.785 --> 05:56.126
AND JUST GET RID OF THE BODY?

05:56.126 --> 05:57.588
I CAN FIX THIS.

05:57.588 --> 05:59.029
I'M THE ONE WHO FIGURED OUT
HOW TO GET OUR HANDS UNSTUCK

05:59.029 --> 06:01.892
FROM THE AIR CONDITIONER VENT,
WASN'T I?

06:01.892 --> 06:03.093
(both groan)

06:03.093 --> 06:04.465
OH, WE'RE STUCK.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.537
DOES ANYBODY EVEN KNOW
WE'RE HERE?

06:06.537 --> 06:09.600
I KNEW THIS IS HOW DEATH
WOULD FIND ME. (sobs)
(panting)

06:09.600 --> 06:11.041
THAT WASN'T EXACTLY
A CHALLENGE.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.703
WE JUST HAD TO CALM DOWN
AND UNCLENCH OUR FISTS.

06:12.703 --> 06:14.144
I'M SERIOUS, WILL.

06:14.144 --> 06:15.506
THIS ALREADY FEELS LIKE
ONE OF THOSE PROJECTS

06:15.506 --> 06:18.449
THAT YOU START AND NEVER GETS
DONE, LIKE LUCY'S SWING SET.

06:18.449 --> 06:20.411
LUCY DOESN'T HAVE A SWING SET.
SHE ONLY HAS A BAG OF BOLTS

06:20.411 --> 06:23.554
AND CHAINS AND SWINGS SHE PLAYS
WITH NEXT TO HER LUMBER PILE.

06:24.655 --> 06:27.017
OH, DAMN IT, WILL.

06:27.017 --> 06:30.591
HEY, HEY. I'M GONNA FINISH THAT.
THERESA JUST GETS IMPATIENT.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.822
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THAT SOMETIMES

06:31.822 --> 06:34.425
A GUY NEEDS A LITTLE BREAK
TO COME UP WITH A PLAN.

06:34.425 --> 06:36.026
I DON'T WANT THIS THING
IN MY GARAGE FOREVER.

06:36.026 --> 06:37.067
IF IT'S STILL HERE IN A WEEK,

06:37.067 --> 06:38.499
I'M GONNA
TAKE CARE OF IT MYSELF.

06:38.499 --> 06:42.032
HONESTLY, KENNY, YOU SHOULD JUST
LET IT DIE A DIGNIFIED DEATH,

06:42.032 --> 06:43.804
LIKE WE DIDN'T DO
WITH GRANDMA.

06:43.804 --> 06:44.805
OHH.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.538
THIS CAR IS NOTHING
LIKE GRANDMA.

06:47.538 --> 06:50.541
IT DOESN'T SPIT OR SLAP
OR SAY RACIST THINGS.

06:50.541 --> 06:52.983
BUT IF YOU DON'T
PUT IT BACK TOGETHER,

06:52.983 --> 06:54.645
I'M-A DOALLTHAT,

06:54.645 --> 06:58.418
YOU LAZY,
LILY-WHITE SNOW DEVIL.

07:01.892 --> 07:04.525
SO I WENT ON MY DATE WITH BECKY,
THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER,

07:04.525 --> 07:06.497
AND I WORE THAT BELT BUCKLE
MY UNCLE ROGER GAVE ME

07:06.497 --> 07:08.499
THAT JUST SAYS, "BALLS."

07:08.499 --> 07:11.431
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT BUCKLE.
IT NEEDS A VERB OR SOMETHING.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.933
(scoffs)
REAL MEN DON'T USE VERBS.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.507
SO... I PROBLEM BECKY.
YOU ME ADVICE.

07:16.507 --> 07:17.508
YOU NEED TO USE VERBS.

07:17.508 --> 07:18.669
FINE. BECKY'S GREAT--

07:18.669 --> 07:21.512
PRETTY, FIRM HANDSHAKE,
CONVERSATIONALLY VULGAR--

07:21.512 --> 07:22.613
EVERYTHING YOU'D WANT
IN A WOMAN.

07:22.613 --> 07:25.015
THE THING IS...
SHE'S A SEXIST.

07:25.015 --> 07:26.176
SHE HAS A PROBLEM WITH MEN?

07:26.176 --> 07:28.118
NO, NOT WITH MEN.

07:28.118 --> 07:31.121
(sobbing)

07:32.523 --> 07:36.156
STUPID WOMAN DRIVER. MOST WOMEN
SHOULD BE BANNED FROM THE ROAD.

07:36.156 --> 07:39.590
OHH, AND LOOK AT HER CRY.
CRYBABY.

07:39.590 --> 07:43.463
WHAT ARE YOU,
ON YOUR PERIOD?!

07:43.463 --> 07:45.766
OKAY. HERE'S MY ADVICE.
DUMP HER.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.967
I NEED DIFFERENT ADVICE.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.869
THEN PUT UP WITH HER.
I CAN'T, WILL.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.001
SEXISM GOES AGAINST
EVERYTHING I BELIEVE.

07:51.001 --> 07:53.043
PEOPLE WHO ASCRIBE
STEREOTYPICAL TRAITS

07:53.043 --> 07:55.105
TO A GROUP OF OTHER PEOPLE
ARE ALL THE SAME,

07:55.105 --> 07:58.048
AND THEY SHOULD BE ROUNDED UP
AND TREATED AS INFERIOR.

07:58.048 --> 08:00.911
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER.
TELL HER IT BOTHERS YOU.

08:00.911 --> 08:02.482
I WANT TO,
BUT HOW DOES A GUY

08:02.482 --> 08:04.184
WEARING A TESTICLE-REFERENCING
BELT BUCKLE

08:04.184 --> 08:06.757
TALK ABOUT HIS FEELINGS?

08:06.757 --> 08:07.758
I TROUBLE.

08:07.758 --> 08:10.721
HEY! I NEED MY CAR, WILL.

08:10.721 --> 08:12.623
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
SHORTS.

08:12.623 --> 08:14.565
I'VE BEEN RIDING MY BIKE TO GO
DO MY ROUNDS BECAUSE SOME IDIOT

08:14.565 --> 08:17.598
TOOK APART MY CAR AND WON'T
PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN!

08:17.598 --> 08:18.699
I'M FIGURING IT OUT.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.070
I WENT ONLINE
TO DO SOME RESEARCH,

08:20.070 --> 08:21.872
BUT I DIDN'T FIND
ANYTHING HELPFUL.

08:21.872 --> 08:23.734
OH, BUT I DID SEE
THIS REALLY FUNNY VIDEO

08:23.734 --> 08:26.276
OF THIS FAT KID
ON A ROLLER COASTER. (laughs)

08:26.276 --> 08:28.809
YOUWILLFIX THIS CAR, WILL.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.781
(whispers) YOUWILL,WILL.

08:30.781 --> 08:32.783
THE QUESTION IS, CAN HE?

08:32.783 --> 08:33.784
(normal voice) WHAT?

08:33.784 --> 08:34.845
NO, I'M SAYING,
"CAN HE?"

08:34.845 --> 08:35.986
WHAT?

08:35.986 --> 08:38.018
"CAN HE" FIX THE CAR?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.519
I'M NOT GONNA FIX IT.
HE TOOK IT APART.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.520
HE SHOULD DO IT.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.521
WHO, WILL?

08:41.521 --> 08:42.653
HEWILL!

08:42.653 --> 08:44.825
I KNOW! HE, WILL.
YOU, KENNY. I, CRAIG.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.226
SEE, THIS IS
HOW REAL MEN TALK.

08:55.666 --> 08:58.909
OH! HI, WILL.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

08:58.909 --> 09:01.311
DOES IT UPSET YOU WHEN
SOMEONE TAKES APART YOUR CAR

09:01.311 --> 09:04.675
AND DOESN'T PUT IT
BACK TOGETHER?WEIRD.

09:04.675 --> 09:05.876
(cackles)

09:05.876 --> 09:08.178
OH, SO THAT'S
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO?

09:08.178 --> 09:11.281
WELL, REMEMBER,
I'M THE ONE WITH ALL THE TOOLS!

09:11.281 --> 09:15.055
EXCEPT THE BIGGEST TOOL OF ALL--
YOU!

09:15.055 --> 09:16.687
MR. PATTERSON.

09:23.634 --> 09:26.637
WHALES ARE STUPID AND THEY TAKE
UP TOO MUCH ROOM IN THE OCEAN.

09:26.637 --> 09:28.839
THESE GET WASHED ON GENTLE.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.877
(yells)

09:36.877 --> 09:38.578
OH, IT'S JUST YOU.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.680
YOU ALMOST TRIGGERED

09:39.680 --> 09:40.951
MY FLIGHT-OR-CURL-UP-INTO-A-BALL
RESPONSE.

09:40.951 --> 09:42.683
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
I LET MYSELF IN.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.685
BRENDA FIGURED OUT
I CLEAN WHEN I GET ANGRY,

09:44.685 --> 09:46.586
AND SHE'S BEEN
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.788
(sighs)

09:47.788 --> 09:49.089
I DON'T WANT HER
TO BENEFIT

09:49.089 --> 09:51.662
FROM HER EXTREMELY
EFFECTIVE SNEAK-ERY.

09:51.662 --> 09:53.193
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TALK TO HER ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS?

09:53.193 --> 09:55.065
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU HIPPIES DO?

09:55.065 --> 09:56.797
I'M WORRIED IF I TALK TO HER
ABOUT IT, I'LL GET ANGRY,

09:56.797 --> 09:59.700
AND THAT'LL MAKE ME CLEAN,
AND AROUND AND AROUND WE'LL GO.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.632
THEN WHY DON'T YOU MAKEHER
ANGRY SO SHE SEES HOW IT FEELS?

10:01.632 --> 10:05.105
THAT'S THE ONLY LANGUAGE THAT
TINY SACK OF EVIL UNDERSTANDS.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.778
OKAY. HOW DO I MAKE HER ANGRY?

10:07.778 --> 10:09.339
WELL, WHEN WE WERE MARRIED,

10:09.339 --> 10:11.712
I DISCOVERED A FEW THINGS
THAT PISS HER OFF.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.083
ACCIDENTALLY
THROWING UP ON HER

10:13.083 --> 10:14.314
WHILE SHE'S SLEEPING
ON THE PLANE,

10:14.314 --> 10:15.746
ACCIDENTALLY
THROWING UP ON HER

10:15.746 --> 10:17.247
WHILE TRYING TO GET
AN EYELASH OUT OF HER EYE,

10:17.247 --> 10:18.749
ACCIDENTALLY
THROWING UP ON--

10:18.749 --> 10:21.692
IF POSSIBLE, I'D LOVE TO GET OUT
OF THE WHOLE UPCHUCK ARENA.

10:21.692 --> 10:23.924
WELL, SHE DOES
HATE BEING SCARED.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.325
I ONCE JUMPED
OUT OF A PILE OF LAUNDRY.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.397
(laughing) SHE GOT SO MAD...

10:27.397 --> 10:29.830
(stops laughing)
IT MADE ME THROW UP ON HER.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.932
SCARE HER, HUH?

10:33.103 --> 10:34.364
LIKE, "BOO!"?

10:34.364 --> 10:36.807
NOT QUITE. LET ME GET A BEER,
AND WE'LL WORK ON IT.

10:38.669 --> 10:39.670
BOO.

10:39.670 --> 10:40.671
OHH!

10:40.671 --> 10:41.742
THAT WAS BETTER?

10:41.742 --> 10:44.815
(high-pitched voice)
WHAT THE HELL?

10:44.815 --> 10:47.147
OH, I MEANT TO TELL YOU,
WILL STOPPED BY EARLIER

10:47.147 --> 10:48.879
AND DISASSEMBLED
YOUR REFRIGERATOR.

10:48.879 --> 10:50.821
(normal voice)
AND YOU JUST LET HIM?

10:50.821 --> 10:53.824
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF
ARRANGEMENT YOU FELLAS HAVE.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.689
AND THAT'S WHY
I GAVE UP CAGE FIGHTING.

10:58.689 --> 11:01.962
I LOVE FIGHTING, OF COURSE.
I JUST HATE BEING CAGED IN.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.334
OH. MY BROTHERS
LOVE FIGHTING, TOO.

11:04.334 --> 11:06.366
YOU SHOULD
FIGHTTHEMSOMETIME.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.038
YEAH.

11:08.038 --> 11:09.239
(chuckles)

11:09.239 --> 11:10.370
(chuckles)

11:10.370 --> 11:13.203
OHH, SHE DIDN'T
ADD THE CHECK RIGHT.

11:13.203 --> 11:16.907
BIG SURPRISE--
A WOMAN WHO CAN'T DO MATH.

11:16.907 --> 11:20.811
YOU KNOW, BECKY, YOU SAY A LOT
OF NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT WOMEN.

11:20.811 --> 11:24.715
YEAH. NOW LET'S GO HOME AND GET
THOSE PANTS OFF YOU, DUMMY.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.057
OKAY.

11:27.057 --> 11:28.959
NOW.

11:28.959 --> 11:29.960
OKAY.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.762
I'M GONNA TEAR YOU UP.

11:31.762 --> 11:33.363
I'M IN.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.470
OHH, KENNY.

11:40.470 --> 11:42.332
OH.

11:42.332 --> 11:44.935
SORRY, WILL.
MY MONEY'S ON KENNY.

11:44.935 --> 11:47.237
SO BECKY AND I WENT OUT
LAST NIGHT,

11:47.237 --> 11:49.810
AND SHE WAS GOD-AWFUL,
BUT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

11:49.810 --> 11:52.182
BECAUSE MY WIENER WANTED
TO HAVE A SEXY ADVENTURE.

11:52.182 --> 11:55.085
ANYWAY, I FIGURE IT'S NOT WRONG
FOR ME TO KEEP SEEING BECKY

11:55.085 --> 11:57.247
AS LONG AS I COUNTERBALANCE
HER SEXIST BEHAVIOR.

11:57.247 --> 11:58.749
SO WHENEVER I'M NOT WITH HER,

11:58.749 --> 12:01.221
I'M GONNA BE EXTRA, EXTRA,
SUPER-DUPER SUPPORTIVE OF WOMEN.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.423
I STARTED THIS MORNING.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.425
OH. LET ME, UH...

12:05.425 --> 12:06.897
(pants)

12:06.897 --> 12:08.999
I'M SORRY, I WAS ABOUT TO TREAT
YOU LIKE AN INCAPABLE WOMAN,

12:08.999 --> 12:12.102
BUT INSTEAD, I WILL CELEBRATE
YOUR POWERFUL FEMALE ABILITY.

12:12.102 --> 12:14.364
(grunting)
YOU GO, GIRL. YOU CAN DO IT.

12:14.364 --> 12:17.037
YOU CAN DO IT. YOU CAN DO IT.
LIFT THAT WATER.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.809
YOU GO, GIRL.
YOU DO IT.

12:18.809 --> 12:21.912
YOU CAN LIFT THAT WATER.
LIFT THAT WATER.

12:21.912 --> 12:23.413
I'M STILL FINE-TUNING
THE CONCEPT.

12:23.413 --> 12:24.945
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS CRAZY.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.046
YEAH, WELL,
FROM THE LOOKS OF YOUR DESK,

12:26.046 --> 12:27.447
YOU CERTAINLY KNOW CRAZY.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.480
IN FACT, YOU'RE A BARMAID
SITTING ON CRAZY'S LAP,

12:30.480 --> 12:33.153
AND CRAZY IS DRUNK,
TRYING TO UNBUTTON YOUR BLOUSE,

12:33.153 --> 12:35.886
AND YOU'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING TO STOP HIM.

12:35.886 --> 12:37.928
(telephone rings)

12:37.928 --> 12:40.460
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO ANSWER THAT?

12:40.460 --> 12:43.964
ONE SECOND. HI, WILL.
SORRY WE MISSED YOU.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.137
IT'S THE SCREWS FROM YOUR DESK.
WE'RE TAKING A PERSONAL DAY.

12:47.137 --> 12:49.269
(high-pitched voice) BOOP.
(normal voice) WELL, HEY, GUYS.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.871
I JUST GOT A TEXT
FROM THERESA.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.173
YOU ONLY HAVE FOUR DAYS
TO FIX MY CAR

12:53.173 --> 12:54.444
BEFORE SHE GETS RID OF IT.

12:54.444 --> 12:56.977
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR DESK?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.148
I WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE
FIXING YOUR CAR BY NOW

12:58.148 --> 13:00.951
IF YOU HADN'T DISTRACTED ME
BY ACTING ALL CRAZY.

13:00.951 --> 13:03.113
OH, YOU KNOW CRAZY.

13:03.113 --> 13:05.285
AND ONCE CRAZY GETS YOUR BLOUSE
UNBUTTONED, HE TAKES YOU OUT

13:05.285 --> 13:08.018
TO A FIELD BY THE TRAIN TRACKS,
LAYS YOU DOWN ON A DOG BLANKET.

13:08.018 --> 13:10.390
YOU JUST KEEP STARING UP
AT THAT MOON, HOPING ONE DAY

13:10.390 --> 13:12.893
YOU'LL GET OUT OF THIS TOWN
AND PROVE YOUR DADDY WRONG,

13:12.893 --> 13:14.324
BECAUSE YOU'RE A DANCER,
DAMN IT--

13:14.324 --> 13:16.897
THAT'S IT.
I'M OUTTA HERE.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.229
(scoffs) WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

13:19.229 --> 13:21.001
I HAVE NO IDEA.

13:23.173 --> 13:25.375
NOT MY FAVORITE SUIT.

13:25.375 --> 13:27.577
NO!

13:27.577 --> 13:32.582
I HOPE REVENGE SUITSYOU,
WILLIAM J. KEEN.

13:32.582 --> 13:35.185
I'M JUST SAYING, THAT CAR'S
TAKING UP ROOM IN THE GARAGE,

13:35.185 --> 13:37.487
I CAN SMELL IT IN THE HOUSE,
AND I NEED IT OUT OF HERE.

13:37.487 --> 13:39.589
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA FIX ITNOW.

13:39.589 --> 13:41.892
YOUR BROTHER'S BEING
TOO BIG A JERK.

13:41.892 --> 13:43.453
WILL, WOULD YOU
COME HERE A MINUTE?

13:45.155 --> 13:48.228
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO BACK
DOWN FOR SOME STUPID MAN REASON,

13:48.228 --> 13:50.260
BUT CAN YOU PLEASE
FIX MY BROTHER'S CAR,

13:50.260 --> 13:51.461
PREFERABLY TONIGHT

13:51.461 --> 13:54.234
SO I CAN PEE WITHOUT CROUCHING
LIKE AN ANCIENT ROMAN?

13:54.234 --> 13:57.007
ICAN'TFIX HIS CAR.

13:58.969 --> 14:01.241
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT ME.
I DON'T FINISH THINGS.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.274
I JUS--I GET OVERWHELMED
AND I GIVE UP.

14:04.274 --> 14:06.046
IF I REALLY PICKED APART
MY PERSONALITY,

14:06.046 --> 14:07.878
I'D HAVE TO SAY...

14:07.878 --> 14:10.220
UGH, FORGET IT.

14:18.889 --> 14:20.630
WELL, I'M GIVING UP
ON THE TOILET, TOO,

14:20.630 --> 14:22.062
AND THAT'S SAD,

14:22.062 --> 14:24.634
SINCE IT'S BEEN THE SITE OF
SOME OF MY GREATEST VICTORIES.

14:24.634 --> 14:25.966
EW.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.868
LOOK, MAYBE YOU JUST NEED
TO PICK ONE THING

14:28.868 --> 14:30.300
AND FOLLOW THROUGH ON IT, JUST
TO SHOW YOURSELF YOU CAN DO IT--

14:30.300 --> 14:32.903
NOT FIXING THE TOILET,
BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH,

14:32.903 --> 14:35.345
BUT THIS DID ALL START
WITH KENNY'S CAR.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.349
YOU'RE RIGHT. I NEED TO SEE
SOMETHING THROUGH TO THE END.

14:39.349 --> 14:43.914
AND I'M GONNA GET STARTED
ON THAT RIGHT NOW.

14:46.256 --> 14:47.317
(thud)

14:47.317 --> 14:51.291
IT'S HAPPENING!
GLOBAL WARMING!

14:51.291 --> 14:54.494
OH, IT'S YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY SLEEPING QUARTERS?

14:54.494 --> 14:57.627
OH, I'M TAKING APART YOUR BED.
I'M NOT GONNA QUIT THIS, KENNY.

14:57.627 --> 15:00.030
I NEED TO PROVE TO MYSELF
THAT I CAN FINISH SOMETHING,

15:00.030 --> 15:02.902
AND THAT THING IS
THIS RIDICULOUS WAR WITH YOU.
(tool clatters)

15:02.902 --> 15:05.905
UM, WHY DON'T YOU JUST FINISH
PUTTING MY CAR BACK TOGETHER,

15:05.905 --> 15:07.177
YOU BUTT-PISTON?

15:07.177 --> 15:09.609
BECAUSE I HAVE NO MECHANICAL
ABILITIES WHATSOEVER.

15:09.609 --> 15:10.941
THEN WHY DID YOU TAKE IT APART
IN THE FIRST PLACE?!

15:10.941 --> 15:14.184
BECAUSE I HAVE NO REASONING
ABILITIES WHATSOEVER.

15:14.184 --> 15:16.916
SO I'M GONNA DISASSEMBLE
YOUR LIFE PIECE BY PIECE

15:16.916 --> 15:18.188
UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT

15:18.188 --> 15:21.221
BUT A PILE OF BEARD HAIR
AND SILLY T-SHIRTS.

15:21.221 --> 15:24.024
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
THIS WAY BEFORE.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.957
YOU'RE SO DETERMINED.
SUCH MAN-LIKE QUALITIES.

15:26.957 --> 15:29.199
IT'S LIKEYOUHAVE
A BOOTY MUG...

15:29.199 --> 15:31.101
INSIDE YOUR SOUL.

15:32.963 --> 15:36.166
OKAY. CLEARLY, YOU WANT THIS
MORE THAN I DO.

15:36.166 --> 15:39.609
YOU WIN. I'M GONNA FIGURE OUT
ANOTHER WAY TO FIX MY CAR.

15:39.609 --> 15:40.971
REALLY?

15:40.971 --> 15:41.972
YEAH.

15:41.972 --> 15:43.073
I SAW SOMETHING
THROUGH TO THE END?

15:44.114 --> 15:47.117
YES! TAKETHAT,CRAZY!

15:47.117 --> 15:50.280
YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT ME.
IAMA DANCER.

15:50.280 --> 15:54.284
YOU GO, WILL! LIVE YOUR DREAMS
FOR THE REST OF US!

15:54.284 --> 15:56.556
YOU MANIAC.

15:59.990 --> 16:03.093
(tires screech)
WAIT!

16:03.093 --> 16:04.294
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

16:04.294 --> 16:05.965
I'M SORRY, KENNY. TIME'S UP.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.198
I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT
OF MEMORIES WITH THIS CAR,

16:08.198 --> 16:10.440
BUT IT'S TIME TO LET IT GO,
SWEETIE.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.172
OKAY, GET THIS PIECE OF CRAP
OUTTA HERE.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.243
NO!

16:13.243 --> 16:15.605
NOT TRANS AM-MIE!

16:15.605 --> 16:19.049
AAH! (pants) HA!

16:19.049 --> 16:22.012
YOU CAN'T TOW IT
IF I'M SITTING IN IT! (grunts)

16:22.012 --> 16:23.983
(whispers) OH, GOD.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.755
(grunts)

16:25.755 --> 16:27.087
(sighs)

16:27.087 --> 16:29.989
HEY! OW! SON OF A...
OHH!

16:29.989 --> 16:31.391
OW! HANG ON!

16:34.624 --> 16:37.127
SO DO WE HAVE SIX MORE WEEKS
OF WINTER, OR WHAT?

16:37.127 --> 16:39.269
HA HA HA. THAT'S VERY FUNNY.
LET ME OUT.

16:39.269 --> 16:41.000
NOT UNTIL YOU DO TO THIS CAR
WHAT WE'RE PRETTY SURE

16:41.000 --> 16:43.002
THAT DISGRUNTLED NURSE
DID TO GRANDMA.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.105
FINE.
I'LL REACH THE LATCH MYSELF.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.737
(grunts)

16:47.737 --> 16:49.539
I CHOOSE TO
STAY HERE FOR NOW.

16:49.539 --> 16:50.640
OKAY.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.382
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

16:52.382 --> 16:54.584
WHY YOU HATE THIS CAR
SO MUCH, THERESA.

16:54.584 --> 16:56.146
BECAUSE IT'S A JERK.

16:56.146 --> 16:58.048
IT'S NOT A JERK.

16:58.048 --> 16:59.589
I SHOULD KNOW
WHAT IT IS, KENNY.

16:59.589 --> 17:03.153
I WAS THE ONE WHO SPENT A SUMMER
WORKING ON IT WITH DAD,

17:03.153 --> 17:06.226
REBUILDING THE ENGINE, REPLACING
THE GEARS IN THE DIFFERENTIAL.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.728
I THINK I SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

17:08.728 --> 17:13.063
YOU'RE UPSET...
ABOUT... SOMETHIN'.

17:13.063 --> 17:15.635
I'M UPSET BECAUSE
AFTER ALL OF THAT WORK,

17:15.635 --> 17:18.168
DAD GAVEYOUTHE CAR
INSTEAD OF ME,

17:18.168 --> 17:19.169
AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MINE.

17:19.169 --> 17:21.541
DAD WAS NOT A GREAT DAD,
THERESA.

17:21.541 --> 17:25.215
WHEN I WAS 10, I CAUGHT A FROG,
I WANTED TO KEEP IT AS A PET,

17:25.215 --> 17:29.079
AND HE WANTED TO EAT ITS LEGS.
GUESS WHO WON?

17:29.079 --> 17:31.451
AND THEY WERE DELICIOUS.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.822
(sighs)

17:34.084 --> 17:37.657
ON MY PROM NIGHT,
I HAD A PIMPLE,

17:37.657 --> 17:39.629
AND DAD POINTED AT IT
IN FRONT OF MY DATE

17:39.629 --> 17:42.362
AND CALLED IT
"MOUNT FACEMORE."

17:42.362 --> 17:47.137
(laughs) I'M SORRY DAD DIDN'T
GIVE YOU THE CAR, THERESA.

17:47.137 --> 17:49.239
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT NOW?

17:49.239 --> 17:51.171
HOW ABOUT THIS INSTEAD?

17:51.171 --> 17:53.243
I'LL HELP YOU GET IT RUNNING

17:53.243 --> 17:55.275
IF YOU LET ME DRIVE IT
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE...

17:55.275 --> 17:58.178
LIKE, WHEN I HAVE A COLD
AND I CAN'T SMELL ANYTHING.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.180
DEAL. HIGH FIVE?

18:00.180 --> 18:01.181
(thud)

18:01.181 --> 18:02.312
OHH!

18:03.313 --> 18:04.714
HELLO AND WELCOME TO

18:04.714 --> 18:08.118
THE FIRST "HEARTHSTONE INSURANCE
CAREER DAY FOR GIRLS."

18:08.118 --> 18:12.192
OUR THEME IS "CRAIG EMPOWERS
FUTURE WOMEN." APPLAUD.

18:13.593 --> 18:17.127
NO! DON'T DO WHAT I SAY
JUST BECAUSE I'M A MAN.

18:17.127 --> 18:19.799
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.132
THOUGHT I'D SEE IF YOU WANTED
TO GRAB A STEAK OR SOMETHIN'.

18:22.132 --> 18:23.333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:23.333 --> 18:26.136
OHH, NOTHING.
I JUST WANDERED IN HERE. WH--

18:26.136 --> 18:27.837
MR. GRIFFITH
INVITED MY CLASS

18:27.837 --> 18:29.579
TO HEAR A TALK ABOUT
A... CAREER FOR GIRLS.

18:29.579 --> 18:31.611
(whispers)
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.184
YOU'RE REALLY TALKING
TO THESE GIRLS ABOUT CAREERS?

18:34.184 --> 18:36.186
(laughs) THAT'S A WASTE.

18:36.186 --> 18:37.187
WHY IS IT A WASTE?

18:37.187 --> 18:38.648
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

18:38.648 --> 18:42.352
MOST OF YOU SHOULD NOT
AND WILL NEVER HAVE REAL JOBS.

18:42.352 --> 18:44.154
YOU'LL JUST FIND A GUY
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU,

18:44.154 --> 18:45.395
SQUIRT OUT A COUPLE OF KIDS,

18:45.395 --> 18:47.397
AND TRY AND HOLD ON
TO YOUR LOOKS.

18:47.397 --> 18:48.898
WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:48.898 --> 18:50.260
BECKY, I'M SORRY,

18:50.260 --> 18:53.833
BUT YOUR VIEWS ABOUT WOMEN
ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.805
I THOUGHT I COULD GET OVER IT
BECAUSE WE HAD FANTASTIC...

18:55.805 --> 18:57.907
PLAYTIME TOGETHER.
(chuckles)

18:57.907 --> 18:59.909
I MEAN, REALLY GOOD,
CREATIVE STUFF.

18:59.909 --> 19:03.273
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS I THINK
WOMEN CAN BE WHATEVER THEY WANT.
(gasps)

19:03.273 --> 19:06.576
LIKE A DOCTOR
OR A LAWYER OR...

19:06.576 --> 19:07.877
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE,
SWEETHEART?

19:07.877 --> 19:09.148
A UNICORN!

19:10.220 --> 19:12.922
AND YOU WILL BE.

19:12.922 --> 19:15.655
YOU SEE, BECKY? I'M A FEMINIST,
AND WHILE I WISH SHE HAD SAID

19:15.655 --> 19:18.258
SOMETHING LIKE "ASTRONAUT"
INSTEAD OF A MADE-UP CREATURE,

19:18.258 --> 19:19.429
I THINK THAT THESE GIRLS

19:19.429 --> 19:21.761
CAN DO WHATEVER
THEY PUT THEIR MINDS TO.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.894
(girls) WHOO!

19:24.894 --> 19:28.668
UGH. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
YOUR BOOTY MUG IS A LIAR.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.502
OH! AND TO THINK I ALMOST
LET YOU FIGHT MY FOUR BROTHERS,

19:32.502 --> 19:35.675
MIKEY, TOMMY,
DANNY, AND STEVE.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.247
FOUR OF 'EM?

19:37.247 --> 19:38.848
(exhales deeply)

19:38.848 --> 19:42.952
THIS IS A GOOD MAN! LET'S PARADE
HIM AROUND ON OUR SHOULDERS!

19:42.952 --> 19:44.954
UH, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD I--

19:44.954 --> 19:46.656
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT AM I SAYING?

19:46.656 --> 19:49.188
IF YOU CAN DREAM IT,
YOU CAN DO IT, LADIES!

19:49.188 --> 19:50.420
HOIST AWAY!

19:50.420 --> 19:53.493
(girls giggling)

19:58.228 --> 19:59.299
BOO!

19:59.299 --> 20:00.370
AAH!
(squish)

20:00.370 --> 20:01.371
(grunts)

20:01.371 --> 20:02.372
(gasps)

20:02.372 --> 20:05.505
SO MUCH FOR
MY NINE YEARS OF KARATE.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.278
OH, MY GOD.
WHY DID YOU SCARE ME?

20:08.278 --> 20:09.379
I WAS TRYING
TO TEACH YOU A LESSON

20:09.379 --> 20:11.641
ABOUT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE EMOTIONALLY TOYED WITH.

20:11.641 --> 20:14.384
I DID NOT ANTICIPATE IT
ENDING IN A STABBING.

20:14.384 --> 20:16.386
FRANKLY, I'M SURPRISED
ABOUT THAT, TOO.

20:16.386 --> 20:19.619
THE TRUTH IS... I'M SCARED
ABOUT MOVING IN TOGETHER.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.421
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK.

20:21.421 --> 20:24.354
GOOD IDEA. I'LL START.

20:24.354 --> 20:26.456
OW.

20:28.998 --> 20:30.260
(Craig)
SOMETIMES IT'S IMPORTANT

20:30.260 --> 20:32.432
TO LET GO OF THINGS
SO YOU CAN MOVE ON.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.763
WILL HAD TO LET GO
OF WANTING TO BE

20:33.763 --> 20:35.835
THE KIND OF GUY
WHO COULD FIX THINGS.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.367
FOR THERESA,

20:37.367 --> 20:40.340
IT WAS LETTING GO
OF HER ANGER TOWARD HER DAD.

20:42.272 --> 20:44.514
FOR BRENDA AND GRANT, IT WAS
LETTING GO OF THEIR FEARS

20:44.514 --> 20:46.776
SO THEY COULD TAKE THE PLUNGE
AND MOVE IN TOGETHER.

20:46.776 --> 20:48.618
BUT WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT
TO LET THINGS GO,

20:48.618 --> 20:50.620
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REALIZE

20:50.620 --> 20:54.624
THAT SOME THINGS
ARE WORTH HOLDING ON TO.

20:54.624 --> 20:57.627
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING US ALL THIS?

20:57.627 --> 21:00.430
SERIOUSLY,
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

21:00.430 --> 21:03.333
THEY'RE MY FRIENDS, AND I WANTED
YOU TO HEAR WHAT THEY LEARNED

21:03.333 --> 21:05.535
SO YOU REALIZE
THAT YOU, TOO, CAN LET GO

21:05.535 --> 21:08.338
OF ANYTHING THAT KEEPS YOU
FROM YOUR DREAMS.

21:08.338 --> 21:09.499
(singsongy) THIS IS BORING.

21:09.499 --> 21:11.341
(normal voice) I THOUGHT
COMING TO AN INSURANCE COMPANY

21:11.341 --> 21:12.802
WOULD BE FUN.

21:12.802 --> 21:14.444
FRANKLY, TESS,
WITH AN ATTITUDE LIKE THAT,

21:14.444 --> 21:15.775
YOU'LL NEVER BE A UNICORN.

21:15.775 --> 21:19.509
ANYWAY, I LEARNED
TO LET GO OF SOMETHING, TOO.

21:19.509 --> 21:22.382
GOOD-BYE, BOOTY MUG.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.783
(thud)
