WEBVTT

00:04.238 --> 00:05.506
All right, everybody.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.108
Drop those patient charts.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.009
I have something
important.

00:11.112 --> 00:15.015
Which tux should I wear
to Dr. Tuttle's wedding
this weekend?

00:15.083 --> 00:17.585
Not to be rude,
but those look
exactly the same.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.687
To be rude, I don't care.

00:19.753 --> 00:20.954
Come on, guys.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.323
I've been pumped
for this wedding

00:22.390 --> 00:23.924
since the invitation
came two months ago.

00:23.991 --> 00:25.626
Wait, you got
your invitation
two months ago?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.228
Mine only came
last week.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.896
Mine, too!

00:28.962 --> 00:30.231
You know
what this means?

00:30.298 --> 00:32.866
We're on the B-team
for Tuttle's wedding.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.335
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

00:34.402 --> 00:36.204
Guys, I'm sure
that's not the case.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.971
An invitation
is an invitation.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.073
I don't know.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.409
Mine was addressed
to "Dr. Julie Dobbs

00:41.475 --> 00:44.345
"or current resident."

00:44.412 --> 00:47.648
When I see Dr. Tuttle,
I'm gonna scream in his face.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.251
There he is!
Hi, Dr. Tuttle!

00:50.318 --> 00:51.652
Ooh! Man of the hour!

00:51.719 --> 00:54.122
(SHOUTING) We can't
wait for your wedding!

00:55.923 --> 00:57.291
Told you.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.692
Ah, come on, bro!

00:58.759 --> 01:00.128
Give me a little
preview of the event.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.329
(CHUCKLES)
What am I working with?

01:01.395 --> 01:02.663
Oh, it's gonna be amazing.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.832
We got the best deejay.
You know Deejay Jazzy Jeff?

01:04.898 --> 01:06.734
(GASPS)
We got his cousin...

01:08.569 --> 01:10.704
Alan Jazzy Jeff.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.306
Well, I hope
he's as talented

01:12.373 --> 01:14.007
on the ones and twos
as his cousin,

01:14.074 --> 01:16.577
'cause I's bring some serious
noise to the dance floor, yo.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.079
Here's a little taste.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.082
(EXCLAIMS)

01:23.551 --> 01:24.918
PAT: Tuttle!

01:24.985 --> 01:26.554
Hey, well,

01:26.620 --> 01:29.290
after tomorrow
you no longer be a free man.

01:29.357 --> 01:33.060
Well, last call to get some
honey on the old stinger, eh?

01:35.129 --> 01:36.764
Yeah, I'm good.
All right, I'll see you.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.632
I'll see y'all tomorrow.
DAMONA: All right! Bye-bye.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.535
(SHOUTING) It's gonna be
a beautiful celebration!

01:42.770 --> 01:44.338
I've had it.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.675
Oh, Ken,
swank formal wear.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.210
Yeah.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.545
I've been renting mine
since I lost it in a fire.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.047
Started by my wife,
while it was still
on my body.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.752
Anyway, quick download
about this wedding...

01:58.819 --> 02:00.521
Now, out of respect
for my desire

02:00.588 --> 02:03.657
to only socialize
with those at
or above my status,

02:03.724 --> 02:05.859
I'm gonna request
that the three of you...

02:05.926 --> 02:08.229
Don't talk to me
directly.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.464
And I don't want any
of your usual pushback.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.366
You got it.
Tough but fair.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.001
Thy will be done.
PAT: Ah!

02:14.067 --> 02:15.936
Good group.
Very respectful.

02:16.003 --> 02:18.071
And, oh, good luck
picking your tux.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.908
But, remember,
they all look the same
when they're on fire.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.848
The food
is gonna be awesome!

02:27.915 --> 02:30.017
Oh, and Will Smith's
deejay's cousin is spinning,

02:30.083 --> 02:32.152
so you know the tunes
are gonna be dope!

02:32.220 --> 02:34.021
Yay!

02:34.087 --> 02:35.389
Look, I know
you don't love weddings,

02:35.456 --> 02:37.991
but this one's
gonna be de-luxe.

02:38.058 --> 02:39.760
Mom, you don't like
weddings?

02:39.827 --> 02:42.162
They're fine.
I'm just not as into them
as your father is.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.164
It's true.
She wanted to elope,

02:44.232 --> 02:45.899
almost denied me
my dream wedding.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.701
Well, what would have been
my dream wedding,

02:47.768 --> 02:49.437
which she almost
ruined anyway.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.172
I accidentally saw him in
his tux before the ceremony.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.374
(GASPS)

02:53.441 --> 02:55.576
(CELLPHONE CHIMES)

02:55.643 --> 02:59.079
Oh, no. (GASPS)
Megan's got food poisoning!

02:59.146 --> 03:00.581
She can't
babysit tonight.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.316
What are we gonna do?
(SIGHS)

03:02.383 --> 03:03.684
You know what?
You go.

03:03.751 --> 03:04.885
I'll stay here
with the kids.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.220
It's all your work people.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.988
You'll have a great time
without me.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.757
No, I can't go
without you.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.425
Who would I dance with?

03:11.492 --> 03:13.694
Oh, and that thing I do
when I say,

03:13.761 --> 03:15.929
"Hi, I'm Ken Park
and this is my wife Jurassic."

03:15.996 --> 03:17.998
(LAUGHS) People love that.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.001
We can't just
leave Dave alone.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.504
It'll be okay.
I'll watch Home alone.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.406
It'll be a night of irony.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.510
Okay, Molly,
you're staying home
with Dave tonight.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.778
What? No!

03:30.844 --> 03:32.112
I'm supposed to go
to the grove with my friends!

03:32.179 --> 03:34.448
Oh, really?
How long you
been planning that?

03:34.515 --> 03:36.083
A couple days.
Oh, yeah?

03:36.149 --> 03:37.785
I've been planning this
for a couple of months, girl.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.487
I even got two haircuts
for this.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.022
one to train my part,
the other to reinforce it.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.558
You will not take this
night away from me.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.429
Okay, fine, I'll do it.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.764
(CHUCKLES SMUGLY)
For the record,
I liked your hair before.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.232
Don't go there.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.968
Okay, problem solved.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.872
(CELLPHONE DINGS)
Oh! And our Uber driver
Varis is here!

03:58.939 --> 04:01.309
(CHUCKLES) Varis!

04:01.375 --> 04:03.344
Varis!
We're coming, buddy!

04:03.411 --> 04:06.947
Now, remember,
Uber passengers are rated,
too, so just be cool.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.516
Last time I pulled a two-star

04:08.582 --> 04:10.150
after a pretty serious
directional dispute.

04:10.217 --> 04:13.487
Yeah. I remember.
How do you not
take Cahuenga?

04:15.055 --> 04:17.491
(MUSIC PLAYING)

04:17.558 --> 04:20.728
Hey, guys,
I don't see my name.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.431
Is there a world where they
think my name is "Cliff?"

04:23.497 --> 04:24.865
Because there's a "Cliff."

04:26.767 --> 04:29.002
Man, we don't have
any seats!

04:29.069 --> 04:31.339
Classic B-team.

04:31.405 --> 04:34.141
Oh, I don't where,
but I'm sitting down
at some point.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.944
I can't just
stand up all night,
not in these heels,

04:37.010 --> 04:40.080
not in this dress,
not in this wig.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.818
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

04:48.221 --> 04:50.223
Oh, hey, Pat.
What are you doing
over here?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.659
Oh, I'm just trying
to avoid the others.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.927
Who?
Oh, you know,
the ones from work.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.229
You know, the one with the
Wanda Sykes-style attitude,

04:56.296 --> 04:57.965
the guy who always sounds
like he's greeting people

04:58.031 --> 04:59.433
.at a renaissance fair,

04:59.500 --> 05:01.068
and the gal with the,
uh, the voice of a...

05:01.134 --> 05:03.537
...of a helium addict.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.839
I've been looking for you.
Why aren't you dancing?

05:05.906 --> 05:09.810
Ah, well,
I recently tore my ACL
in a conga line.

05:09.877 --> 05:13.213
But, with that said,
when the music calls,
I must answer.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.815
See you out there.

05:14.882 --> 05:15.916
(CHUCKLES)

05:15.983 --> 05:17.585
Ah.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.053
(GRUNTS) Come on, girl.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.321
You want me
to call your mama

05:21.389 --> 05:24.157
and tell her you refuse
to shake what she gave you?

05:24.224 --> 05:27.094
Okay, fine. Let's go.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.030
* That girl is poison

05:34.435 --> 05:36.169
* Never trust a big butt
and smile

05:36.236 --> 05:38.706
* That girl is poison

05:43.577 --> 05:46.346
* If I were you,
I'd take precaution

05:47.381 --> 05:51.184
* Before I start
to meet my girl

05:51.251 --> 05:52.486
* You know

05:52.553 --> 05:55.923
* 'Cause in some motion

05:55.989 --> 06:00.227
* You'll think she's
the best thing in the world

06:01.028 --> 06:04.264
* She's so fly

06:04.331 --> 06:08.068
* She'd drive you
right out of your mind

06:08.135 --> 06:10.404
* Steal your heart
when you're blind *

06:10.471 --> 06:11.505
(SCREAMING)

06:12.139 --> 06:14.007
(DOORBELL RINGING)

06:14.975 --> 06:16.610
Did we order
pizza already?

06:16.677 --> 06:19.379
Bless you, child.
I am starving!

06:22.650 --> 06:23.917
Hi, Mrs. Pancake.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.653
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.089
It's a pleasure to sit
for little Dave again.

06:29.156 --> 06:32.460
So, has he been changed?

06:32.526 --> 06:34.762
Well, it couldn't hurt
to check.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.230
Molly, a word.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.303
Why is she here?
She hasn't sat
for us in years.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.805
I called Mrs. P
out of retirement

06:44.872 --> 06:46.874
so I can go to the grove
with my friends.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.577
That's not fair.
Why do you get to go out
and I have to stay here?

06:49.643 --> 06:51.679
(SCOFFS)
Where would you even go?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.114
There's a Magic:
The gathering gathering
at gamer's paradise.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.950
I'm sure one of the nerds
will blog about it.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.852
Yeah, that nerd
could have been me.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.789
I'll tell Mom and Dad.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.758
(GROANS) Fine.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.094
You can order pizza and pick
whatever toppings you want.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.395
Yes!

07:08.462 --> 07:12.766
Hello, cheese pizza topped
with mini cheese pizzas.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.869
Okay.
He's in bed by 10:30,

07:15.936 --> 07:17.337
he can have
all the pizza he wants,

07:17.404 --> 07:19.172
but try to limit
his sugar consumption.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.208
Make sure he flosses, brushes,
and wears his night guard.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.510
Make sure you
tarp his pillow,

07:22.576 --> 07:23.777
because the mouth guard
makes him drool.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.245
And make sure you
turn his fan on high,

07:25.312 --> 07:27.481
because the tarp
makes him sweat.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.483
I remember the drill!

07:33.954 --> 07:35.288
Ooh.

07:35.355 --> 07:38.391
What I would do
to that guy after 12 dates.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.729
Julie, just give it up.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.131
Finding love
at a wedding isn't real.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.533
You know what is real?

07:45.599 --> 07:48.001
That raw bar.
I'm gonna go post up.
You coming?

07:48.068 --> 07:51.071
No. Your oyster etiquette
leaves a lot to be desired.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.575
I slurp how I slurp.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.147
Oh, sorry.
No. No, please.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.815
No, no, no.
I'm just grabbing a beer.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.283
You like beer?

08:04.117 --> 08:05.553
I love beer.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.320
(LAUGHS) I love beer!

08:07.387 --> 08:09.990
Oh!
That's so crazy!

08:10.057 --> 08:11.859
It's so crazy. I've never met
anybody else who likes beer.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.160
Don't tell me
you also like food.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.395
I'm obsessed with it.
(LAUGHS)

08:15.462 --> 08:16.997
Literally eat it
three times a day,

08:17.064 --> 08:19.199
could not survive
without it.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.801
Okay.
On the count of three,

08:20.868 --> 08:22.369
name your favorite TV show,
all right?

08:22.435 --> 08:25.238
One, two, three.
House of Cards.
Whatever yours is!

08:25.305 --> 08:27.440
Oh, my God.
What are the chances, huh?

08:29.810 --> 08:31.579
(ALL LAUGHING)

08:31.645 --> 08:33.747
Hello, fellow table mates.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.583
(SILENCE)

08:38.986 --> 08:40.588
(EXCITEDLY) So...

08:40.654 --> 08:42.289
Where do you all know
the happy couple from?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.324
We all went to college
with Beth.

08:44.391 --> 08:45.793
Did you go to Dartmouth?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.160
Never heard of it.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.031
(MURMURING)

08:53.100 --> 08:54.768
There you are.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.537
Oh, why do you
keep ghosting me
on the dance floor?

08:57.605 --> 08:59.339
Oh. I thought
you were ghosting me.

08:59.406 --> 09:02.009
This place must be
pretty haunted, huh?
(LAUGHS)

09:03.176 --> 09:04.511
Okay, Alli,
you know what?

09:04.578 --> 09:06.780
I've held this in for a while,
but I'm just gonna say it.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.049
Your whole
"I don't like weddings" thing,

09:09.116 --> 09:11.418
it's a real bummer.
It's a bummer?

09:11.484 --> 09:13.220
Yeah! I'm trying
to have fun with you,

09:13.286 --> 09:15.222
and it's like you don't
even want to be here.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.857
Bum-mer.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.659
You know what, Ken?

09:18.726 --> 09:19.960
As long as we're
being honest,

09:20.027 --> 09:22.529
the truth is,
I love weddings.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.732
No, you don't.
Yeah, I do.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.299
The only thing I don't
like about weddings

09:26.366 --> 09:27.500

No. Actually, Ken,
you know what you are?

You're a selfish dancer.

you dance at me,

09:40.113 --> 09:42.115

you're all about you.

That's ridiculous!

We danced for six
straight songs together.

Ken, I left the dance floor
five and a half songs ago,

get going to--

Just when you think
you're in a good place, bam!

She ups and calls you
a selfish dancer!
Can you believe that?

11:56.383 --> 11:57.684
You know, this is something
you should probably

11:57.751 --> 11:58.886
discuss with your wife.

from puberty,

12:19.406 --> 12:21.775

for the first time

12:21.842 --> 12:23.643

his mirror had seen.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.816

Oh, and you should
go talk to your wife.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.231
She looks cranky.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.665
You know,
I never understood

12:45.732 --> 12:48.001
why it's called
Super Mario brothers, either.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.103
I mean, their names
are Mario and Luigi.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.571
Right? I mean,
is their last name Mario?

Okay, good for you, Clarky,
but we got to bounce.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.197
We're at the wrong wedding.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.365
What are you talking about?

13:18.431 --> 13:20.233
That's why we didn't
have any place cards

13:20.300 --> 13:23.136
and why the cocktail napkins
say "Mr. And Mrs. Tutupu."

13:25.205 --> 13:27.340
And when I went to
congratulate Dr. Tuttle,

13:27.407 --> 13:29.109
he was a foot taller
than usual

13:29.176 --> 13:31.378
and significantly
more Samoan.

every girl to dance with me,

and I got shut down
by all of them.

So, faced with the prospect
of eternal loneliness

I took action.

were just a way
for me to fit in

14:41.148 --> 14:42.849
because I didn't
have a partner.

and I'm like,
"Who wants ice cream?"

20:13.613 --> 20:15.047
And, you know,
Dave was in,

20:15.114 --> 20:18.485
but poor Henry had just
come from a creamery tour.

20:21.153 --> 20:24.023
And, of course Molly
couldn't leave him here alone.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.526
So I rang up Mrs. Pancake
to watch him
while we were gone.

20:26.593 --> 20:27.994
Then Molly and I
got ice cream,

20:28.060 --> 20:29.228
ate it,
and here we are.

20:29.296 --> 20:30.597
The end.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.868
Thanks, Mrs. P.
Awesome stuff tonight.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.271
Thanks, Henry.
Solid hang.

20:42.675 --> 20:46.212
Come on, Henry.
I'll give you a ride home.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.648
Ever been
in a sidecar before?

20:52.619 --> 20:54.086
So sweet.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.289
It's nice to see the kids
doing something together.

20:56.356 --> 20:59.191
Yeah, even if that
something is lying to us.

21:01.294 --> 21:04.731
So you're saying...
Oh!

21:04.797 --> 21:07.066
And that's why... Ah.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.401
(LAUGHS)

21:08.468 --> 21:11.070
Which explains...
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.207
Yeah, I have no idea
what happened here tonight.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.109
Arthur, I'm home!

21:17.977 --> 21:19.812
And I had quite a night.
