<b>A technique that nullifies your <i>Nen</i> aura.</b>

00:16.190 --> 00:17.830
<b>It is effective for concealing your presence,</b>

<b>Four Major Principles</b>

00:39.650 --> 00:43.040
<b>and are critical to the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.</b>

02:08.400 --> 02:09.430
<b>Naturally,</b>

02:09.430 --> 02:11.770
<b>my double is no mere illusion.</b>

02:11.770 --> 02:15.110
<b>It exists as a second me until I send it away.</b>

02:15.950 --> 02:19.260
<b>You know this after suffering 
an attack from my double.</b>

02:20.410 --> 02:24.370
<b>In other words, you must fight both of my selves.</b>

02:27.240 --> 02:30.710
<b>This is the true Tiger Bite Fist, 
completed through the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.</b>

02:31.310 --> 02:33.590
<b>I call it the True Tiger Bite Fist!</b>

02:33.590 --> 02:38.590
<b>A x Surprising x Win</b>

02:41.110 --> 02:44.600
<b>Kastro has used <i>Nen</i> to create 
a double of himself.</b>

02:44.600 --> 02:47.910
<b>And his special attack, the True Tiger Bite Fist,</b>

02:47.910 --> 02:50.600
<b>has severed Hisoka's right arm.</b>

02:50.940 --> 02:54.190
<b>Who will emerge victorious?</b>

03:10.520 --> 03:11.580
<b>What's this?</b>

03:11.580 --> 03:14.930
<b>Hisoka has covered his right arm with a scarf?</b>

03:15.860 --> 03:19.130
<b>Shall I demonstrate my powers of clairvoyance?</b>

03:25.380 --> 03:26.670
<b>Wow!</b>

03:26.670 --> 03:30.440
<b>His right arm has disappeared, 
and cards rain down!</b>

03:30.440 --> 03:32.900
<b>What does he intend to do?!</b>

03:39.700 --> 03:41.040
<b>Now, then...</b>

03:41.040 --> 03:43.360
<b>I have cards here, from one to thirteen.</b>

03:43.840 --> 03:46.780
<b>Pick a number from these,</b>

03:46.780 --> 03:49.370
<b>and picture it in your head.</b>

03:50.290 --> 03:52.120
<b>Pick a number?</b>

03:53.990 --> 03:55.380
<b>Are you ready?</b>

03:55.840 --> 03:59.410
<b>Once you have your number, add four,</b>

03:59.410 --> 04:01.130
<b>and double the result.</b>

04:01.950 --> 04:05.140
<b>After that, subtract six, and divide by two.</b>

04:05.730 --> 04:09.080
<b>Finally, subtract your original number,</b>

04:09.080 --> 04:10.390
<b>and what do you have?</b>

04:10.390 --> 04:12.060
<b>Um...</b>

04:12.060 --> 04:13.970
<b>Hey, did he say to subtract six?</b>

04:13.970 --> 04:15.900
<b>Jeez, I don't know!</b>

04:16.710 --> 04:20.400
<b>I already know your answer.</b>

04:30.640 --> 04:34.120
<b>The answer is one.</b>

04:34.410 --> 04:35.730
<b>He's right!</b>

04:35.730 --> 04:36.950
<b>How?</b>

04:36.950 --> 04:38.130
<b>Seriously?</b>

04:38.690 --> 04:40.000
<b>This is very strange...</b>

04:40.000 --> 04:41.260
<b>Insane!</b>

04:41.260 --> 04:43.050
<b>A satanic magic trick!</b>

04:43.050 --> 04:46.770
<b>And he's incorporated his own 
injury into the trick!</b>

04:48.400 --> 04:51.890
<b><i>Why is he so calm?</i></b>

04:51.890 --> 04:53.660
<b>The trick is worth no points.</b>

04:53.660 --> 04:55.890
<b>That had no effect on the match,</b>

04:55.890 --> 04:57.790
<b>but he's performing tricks!</b>

04:57.790 --> 05:00.770
<b>Hisoka is being totally bizarre again!</b>

05:01.480 --> 05:03.280
<b>You may keep this as a souvenir.</b>

05:04.670 --> 05:06.060
<b>Scumbag.</b>

05:06.060 --> 05:08.160
<b>I will sever your left arm,</b>

05:08.160 --> 05:10.240
<b>so you can never mock anyone again.</b>

05:13.240 --> 05:15.350
<b>Did you not hear me the first time?</b>

05:15.350 --> 05:16.750
<b>You may have it.</b>

05:17.700 --> 05:19.630
<b>Your wish will be granted!</b>

05:19.630 --> 05:22.920
<b>Whoa! One of the Kastros is charging forward!</b>

05:25.640 --> 05:30.480
<b>Hisoka has sacrificed his one remaining arm!</b>

05:30.970 --> 05:34.080
<b>What is he thinking?!</b>

05:34.080 --> 05:35.090
<b>What?</b>

05:38.780 --> 05:42.150
<b>As expected, you attacked with your double.</b>

05:42.150 --> 05:47.230
<b>Had you, yourself, attacked, 
I would have countered.</b>

05:49.270 --> 05:50.950
<b>With this.</b>

05:52.280 --> 05:56.950
<b>Huh? His severed right arm has been restored!</b>

05:59.920 --> 06:02.160
<b>This is another magic trick.</b>

06:02.160 --> 06:05.210
<b>Can you guess the secret behind it?</b>

06:05.420 --> 06:06.610
<b><i>He's lying...</i></b>

06:06.610 --> 06:10.190
<b><i>He's obviously employing Nen 
to accomplish this feat.</i></b>

06:11.120 --> 06:14.340
<b><i>But what type of Nen is he using?</i></b>

06:17.550 --> 06:18.920
<b>What's wrong?</b>

06:18.920 --> 06:20.600
<b>Are you frightened?</b>

06:21.220 --> 06:23.560
<b>You're surprised because you 
don't understand my trick.</b>

06:24.690 --> 06:26.860
<b>That's how magic works.</b>

06:27.280 --> 06:30.560
<b>Your power to create a double 
is certainly magnificent.</b>

06:30.560 --> 06:32.870
<b>But now I understand your ability.</b>

06:33.930 --> 06:38.250
<b>I can also anticipate how you 
will attack with your double.</b>

06:38.250 --> 06:40.870
<b>And I know how to counter that attack.</b>

06:41.280 --> 06:43.220
<b>It's quite unfortunate.</b>

06:45.120 --> 06:48.190
<b>You have the talent to 
become a skilled opponent.</b>

06:49.310 --> 06:52.700
<b>That was why I spared your life.</b>

06:54.270 --> 06:56.120
<b>Here is a prediction...</b>

06:56.120 --> 06:58.890
<b>You will die, in a frenzied dance.</b>

07:01.480 --> 07:03.650
<b>Silence!</b>

07:08.450 --> 07:10.530
<b><i>H-How did he pick me out?</i></b>

07:10.910 --> 07:15.700
<b>Doubles are created in the original's image,</b>

07:16.160 --> 07:17.790
<b>so they tend to be pristine.</b>

07:18.540 --> 07:22.660
<b>But you can't recreate every 
effect of an ongoing battle.</b>

07:24.460 --> 07:25.670
<b>Oh?</b>

07:26.250 --> 07:28.340
<b>Did you not realize this?</b>

07:41.620 --> 07:44.350
<b>What is going on here?</b>

07:44.350 --> 07:48.030
<b>This sequence of events is 
impossible to understand!</b>

07:48.030 --> 07:50.740
<b>Is this another of Hisoka's tricks?</b>

07:51.380 --> 07:52.720
<b>Don't bother.</b>

07:52.720 --> 07:55.360
<b>I hit you in the chin,</b>

07:55.360 --> 07:58.240
<b>so you'll have difficulty moving for a while.</b>

07:58.600 --> 08:02.250
<b>Meaning that you won't be able 
to evade my next attack.</b>

08:05.410 --> 08:06.520
<b><i>What?</i></b>

08:07.050 --> 08:09.250
<b><i>Where did this attack come from?</i></b>

08:09.880 --> 08:12.100
<b><i>No, I don't have time for that...</i></b>

08:12.100 --> 08:13.720
<b><i>I must use a double to block the cards!</i></b>

08:13.720 --> 08:16.220
<b>You can't create another double.</b>

08:18.010 --> 08:22.710
<b>You need intense focus to 
create a double with <i>Nen</i>.</b>

08:24.650 --> 08:29.650
<b>The only reason you were able 
to use doubles freely</b>

08:31.020 --> 08:33.610
<b>was because you had a normal state of mind.</b>

08:37.420 --> 08:40.700
<b>Using <i>Nen</i> to replicate and manipulate</b>

08:41.450 --> 08:43.830
<b>something as complex as a human being</b>

08:44.940 --> 08:46.960
<b>is extremely difficult.</b>

08:48.350 --> 08:50.650
<b>Just how difficult is it?</b>

08:50.650 --> 08:52.980
<b>By the time you've learned to use a double,</b>

08:52.980 --> 08:56.930
<b>you've forgotten how to use 
<i>Nen</i> for anything else.</b>

08:56.930 --> 09:01.930
<b>I call that running out of memory.</b>

09:04.320 --> 09:08.250
<b>You lost because you wasted memory space.</b>

09:14.840 --> 09:17.080
<b>Kastro can no longer stand!</b>

09:17.080 --> 09:20.110
<b>Hisoka wins by knockout!</b>

09:25.390 --> 09:26.530
<b>Hisoka...</b>

09:40.950 --> 09:42.390
<b>Good work.</b>

09:44.710 --> 09:47.530
<b>Now, show me that injury.</b>

09:57.800 --> 09:59.730
<b>I was never absolutely certain,</b>

09:59.730 --> 10:02.120
<b>but today's match confirmed it.</b>

10:03.180 --> 10:04.770
<b>You are an idiot.</b>

10:06.230 --> 10:07.620
<b>Perhaps.</b>

10:08.230 --> 10:11.650
<b>Why do you endanger yourself this way?</b>

10:11.650 --> 10:14.630
<b>Was that meant as a 
performance or something?</b>

10:14.980 --> 10:15.930
<b>Who knows?</b>

10:19.270 --> 10:22.640
<b>Well, I can't complain, since I'm getting paid.</b>

10:31.560 --> 10:33.650
<b>I'll stop your bleeding first.</b>

10:38.640 --> 10:40.040
<b>Hey, hey.</b>

10:40.040 --> 10:42.190
<b>Please try to be gentle.</b>

10:42.190 --> 10:45.040
<b>Yeah, yeah. Just put away your aura.</b>

10:54.630 --> 10:56.360
<b>I'll start with the left arm.</b>

11:01.550 --> 11:02.680
<b>Here I go.</b>

11:03.560 --> 11:05.270
<b><i>Nen Stitches.</i></b>

11:04.180 --> 11:05.680
<b>Nen Stitches</b>

11:14.400 --> 11:15.810
<b>Okay, all done.</b>

11:16.610 --> 11:19.240
<b>Blood vessels, bones, nerves, and muscles.</b>

11:19.240 --> 11:21.570
<b>Basically, it's one hundred percent connected.</b>

11:26.640 --> 11:28.160
<b>An excellent job.</b>

11:28.650 --> 11:29.960
<b>Next,</b>

11:29.960 --> 11:31.290
<b>I'll do your right arm.</b>

11:31.780 --> 11:33.960
<b>Hold it yourself this time.</b>

11:41.260 --> 11:43.760
<b>I'm always mesmerized by your skill.</b>

11:48.040 --> 11:51.650
<b>Perhaps I get myself injured</b>

11:51.650 --> 11:54.440
<b>so I can watch you work your magic.</b>

11:54.800 --> 11:55.930
<b>Right.</b>

11:55.930 --> 11:57.320
<b>Twenty million for the left arm.</b>

11:57.320 --> 11:58.700
<b>Fifty million for the right.</b>

11:58.700 --> 12:01.440
<b>Pay up. Now.</b>

12:01.440 --> 12:04.030
<b>I'll send the money to your account.</b>

12:04.030 --> 12:05.250
<b>All right.</b>

12:05.830 --> 12:08.840
<b>You can treat the rest of 
your injuries yourself.</b>

12:08.840 --> 12:10.950
<b>You could provide better service.</b>

12:11.560 --> 12:14.760
<b>You should be able to manage 
with your Bungee Gum</b>

12:14.760 --> 12:16.460
<b>and Texture Surprise.</b>

12:17.060 --> 12:18.250
<b>Oh...</b>

12:18.250 --> 12:20.460
<b>I should probably conceal this.</b>

12:20.460 --> 12:21.470
<b>That way,</b>

12:22.050 --> 12:25.690
<b>they'll think my arms were 
healed during the match.</b>

12:28.320 --> 12:31.980
<b>This is an ordinary scarf, 
with no special features.</b>

12:33.270 --> 12:34.480
<b>I use Bungee Gum</b>

12:34.980 --> 12:36.850
<b>to attach it to my arm.</b>

12:36.850 --> 12:40.480
<b>Then I use Texture Surprise 
to create a layer of skin.</b>

12:43.000 --> 12:43.990
<b><i>He's so fast...</i></b>

12:44.980 --> 12:47.680
<b><i>That was fast enough to fool a </i>Nen<i> master</i></b>

12:47.680 --> 12:49.970
<b><i>into believing the arm had actually healed,</i></b>

12:49.970 --> 12:52.500
<b><i>before he even knew what was happening.</i></b>

12:53.640 --> 12:55.500
<b>Next, I'll do the left.</b>

12:56.380 --> 12:58.010
<b><i>Bungee Gum...</i></b>

12:57.580 --> 13:03.510
<b>Bungee Gum (Elastic Love)</b>

12:58.690 --> 13:00.720
<b><i>He molds his aura into a substance</i></b>

13:00.720 --> 13:03.510
<b><i>with the properties of rubber and gum.</i></b>

13:03.890 --> 13:06.620
<b><i>It can stretch, swiftly contract,</i></b>

13:06.620 --> 13:09.450
<b><i>adhere to most substances,</i></b>

13:09.450 --> 13:11.520
<b><i>and be removed at any time.</i></b>

13:12.150 --> 13:16.520
<b>By the way, I call this Bungee Gum 
because when I was a child,</b>

13:16.520 --> 13:19.520
<b>that was the name of my 
favorite chewing gum.</b>

13:20.260 --> 13:22.530
<b>I didn't need to know that.</b>

13:24.090 --> 13:26.030
<b><i>Texture Surprise...</i></b>

13:26.050 --> 13:34.040
<b>Texture Surprise (Flimsy Lies)</b>

13:26.620 --> 13:29.460
<b><i>He combines aura with the power of his imagination,</i></b>

13:29.460 --> 13:31.500
<b><i>to reproduce the appearance of skin.</i></b>

13:32.210 --> 13:36.770
<b><i>Essentially, it's a high-quality copy, 
so you can tell it's fake if you touch it.</i></b>

13:37.460 --> 13:40.540
<b><i>However, Hisoka enjoys the thrill...</i></b>

13:41.220 --> 13:44.080
<b>The name Texture Surprise 
comes from the stickers</b>

13:44.080 --> 13:47.470
<b>that were included with a popular snack</b>

13:47.470 --> 13:49.300
<b>a while back.</b>

13:49.750 --> 13:52.310
<b>Like I said, I didn't need to know that.</b>

13:52.860 --> 13:56.740
<b>But weren't you impressed by my application</b>

13:57.320 --> 13:59.500
<b>of these two abilities during the fight?</b>

13:59.500 --> 14:00.380
<b>Huh?</b>

14:00.870 --> 14:03.320
<b>You saw everything, didn't you?</b>

14:03.760 --> 14:05.960
<b>Well, yeah...</b>

14:08.050 --> 14:09.500
<b>As a distraction,</b>

14:09.500 --> 14:12.680
<b>you sent thirteen cards flying into the air,</b>

14:12.680 --> 14:16.330
<b>while throwing your arm and a scarf so they'd</b>

14:16.330 --> 14:20.280
<b>stick to the roof and floor with Bungee Gum.</b>

14:21.990 --> 14:24.840
<b>The aura from each was also tied</b>

14:25.170 --> 14:27.340
<b>to your right arm.</b>

14:28.230 --> 14:31.910
<b>Additionally, you connected aura to 
the thirteen cards on the floor,</b>

14:32.870 --> 14:37.600
<b>and held the ends with your left hand.</b>

14:38.290 --> 14:39.600
<b>Then,</b>

14:39.600 --> 14:42.020
<b>when you threw the ace of spades at Kastro,</b>

14:43.040 --> 14:44.900
<b><i>You may keep this as a souvenir.</i></b>

14:45.340 --> 14:48.420
<b>the aura in your left hand was released.</b>

14:49.240 --> 14:50.400
<b>And connected.</b>

14:51.350 --> 14:55.910
<b>The thirteen aura strands stuck to Kastro.</b>

14:56.450 --> 15:00.170
<b>But Kastro never noticed.</b>

15:00.670 --> 15:03.270
<b>You employed one of the basic techniques,</b>

15:03.270 --> 15:07.640
<b><i>Zetsu</i>, to help mask your aura.</b>

15:08.330 --> 15:10.930
<b>However, there was a flaw...</b>

15:11.410 --> 15:14.870
<b>Yes, someone trained in <i>Ren</i>,</b>

15:14.870 --> 15:17.010
<b>another of the basic techniques,</b>

15:17.010 --> 15:19.190
<b>could have focused the <i>Nen</i> in their eyes,</b>

15:19.190 --> 15:21.870
<b>to see through your plan.</b>

15:24.130 --> 15:25.690
<b>That's why you</b>

15:25.690 --> 15:28.690
<b>used that twisted magic trick 
to throw him off guard,</b>

15:29.340 --> 15:32.700
<b>while you pretended to be 
reserving your strength.</b>

15:33.300 --> 15:37.650
<b>It even worked as camouflage, 
convincing him that your lack of aura</b>

15:37.650 --> 15:39.570
<b>was a sign of confidence.</b>

15:40.280 --> 15:44.960
<b>After meticulously confirming 
that your plan was working,</b>

15:44.960 --> 15:47.460
<b>you extended a thread of 
aura from your left hand,</b>

15:47.460 --> 15:51.920
<b>the same one holding the cards, 
and connected it to Kastro's chin.</b>

15:53.410 --> 15:55.470
<b>Your preparations were now complete.</b>

15:56.100 --> 15:58.010
<b>You'd already used Texture Surprise</b>

15:58.010 --> 16:01.730
<b>to alter the scarf on the floor 
to resemble human skin.</b>

16:02.810 --> 16:03.480
<b>And so,</b>

16:03.920 --> 16:06.820
<b>when Kastro attacked your left arm,</b>

16:06.820 --> 16:08.650
<b>you activated the Bungee Gum</b>

16:08.650 --> 16:10.990
<b>between your right arm and 
the scarf on the floor.</b>

16:12.040 --> 16:13.770
<b>Your arm was restored,</b>

16:13.770 --> 16:16.780
<b>and the scarf concealed the wound,</b>

16:16.780 --> 16:19.500
<b>leaving everyone convinced that 
your right arm was restored.</b>

16:20.010 --> 16:26.030
<b>However, this performance actually 
helped Kastro to calm down.</b>

16:26.030 --> 16:29.420
<b>It made no sense for a severed arm</b>

16:29.420 --> 16:31.510
<b>to reappear in a pristine state...</b>

16:32.310 --> 16:39.520
<b>Kastro realized that I was 
using <i>Nen</i>, not magic.</b>

16:39.980 --> 16:44.980
<b>But you didn't miss the subtle change 
in his psychological state.</b>

16:46.180 --> 16:49.500
<b><i>Your power to create a double 
is certainly magnificent.</i></b>

16:49.500 --> 16:51.530
<b><i>But now I understand your ability.</i></b>

16:52.850 --> 16:57.180
<b><i>I can also anticipate how you 
will attack with your double.</i></b>

16:57.180 --> 16:59.540
<b><i>And I know how to counter that attack.</i></b>

17:00.150 --> 17:02.070
<b><i>It's quite unfortunate.</i></b>

17:03.970 --> 17:07.540
<b><i>You have the talent to 
become a skilled opponent.</i></b>

17:08.240 --> 17:11.780
<b><i>That was why I spared your life.</i></b>

17:13.750 --> 17:16.680
<b>Kastro was about to recover.</b>

17:17.010 --> 17:18.110
<b><i>Here is a prediction...</i></b>

17:18.780 --> 17:21.680
<b><i>You will die, in a frenzied dance.</i></b>

17:22.670 --> 17:24.680
<b>But then you pushed him over the edge.</b>

17:26.720 --> 17:29.190
<b><i>Silence!</i></b>

17:30.580 --> 17:32.900
<b><i>H-How did he pick me out?</i></b>

17:33.430 --> 17:37.570
<b><i>But you can't recreate every 
effect of an ongoing battle.</i></b>

17:41.430 --> 17:46.100
<b>You exposed the weakness of his doubles.</b>

17:46.100 --> 17:50.380
<b>But had he stayed composed, 
he had a fair chance.</b>

17:50.750 --> 17:51.420
<b>However...</b>

17:52.770 --> 17:55.420
<b>Kastro couldn't bear the mental strain...</b>

18:07.040 --> 18:09.100
<b>And he lost.</b>

18:10.410 --> 18:14.700
<b>You realize that those two abilities</b>

18:14.700 --> 18:16.110
<b>are perfect for you.</b>

18:16.800 --> 18:19.670
<b>As opposed to Kastro's doubles,</b>

18:19.670 --> 18:21.690
<b>if my opponent knows of my abilities,</b>

18:21.690 --> 18:25.000
<b>I lose nothing because they're so adaptable.</b>

18:28.150 --> 18:29.000
<b>Well,</b>

18:29.490 --> 18:30.910
<b>I'm off.</b>

18:30.910 --> 18:31.920
<b>Already?</b>

18:32.480 --> 18:34.790
<b>My job is done, so I'm not sticking around.</b>

18:35.400 --> 18:38.130
<b>Since Nen Stitches can only do so much,</b>

18:38.130 --> 18:42.010
<b>don't overdo it until your arm's firmly attached.</b>

18:42.700 --> 18:44.210
<b>Oh, that's right.</b>

18:44.670 --> 18:46.020
<b>I came here for a reason.</b>

18:47.630 --> 18:49.480
<b>I have new orders.</b>

18:49.920 --> 18:52.330
<b>All Troupe members are to be in Yorknew City</b>

18:52.330 --> 18:57.010
<b>by noon, August 30th, not just 
those who find it convenient.</b>

18:57.570 --> 18:59.530
<b>Will the boss be coming?</b>

19:00.120 --> 19:01.530
<b>Most likely.</b>

19:02.080 --> 19:04.810
<b>This could be our biggest job yet.</b>

19:05.400 --> 19:06.990
<b>If you skip this one,</b>

19:06.990 --> 19:09.850
<b>the boss might hunt you down himself.</b>

19:09.850 --> 19:11.910
<b>How very scary.</b>

19:11.910 --> 19:15.050
<b>Then, care to join me for dinner tonight?</b>

19:18.140 --> 19:19.550
<b>A pity.</b>

19:27.870 --> 19:30.700
<b>Killua! How was Hisoka's fight?</b>

19:31.040 --> 19:33.980
<b>It was boring.</b>

19:39.590 --> 19:41.570
<b>Did Hisoka win?</b>

19:45.350 --> 19:46.580
<b>I was lying.</b>

19:48.270 --> 19:50.580
<b>It was an incredible fight.</b>

19:51.090 --> 19:55.590
<b>I hate to admit this, but I have 
no idea how Hisoka won.</b>

19:57.200 --> 19:59.410
<b>You couldn't tell?</b>

19:59.950 --> 20:00.590
<b>Gon,</b>

20:01.610 --> 20:05.100
<b>we need to learn more about <i>Nen</i>.</b>

20:07.070 --> 20:08.180
<b>Yeah!</b>

20:26.160 --> 20:27.870
<b><i>He doesn't talk.</i></b>

20:31.910 --> 20:34.240
<b><i>He doesn't talk about the past.</i></b>

20:35.130 --> 20:37.380
<b><i>He has no interest in the past.</i></b>

20:38.390 --> 20:42.880
<b><i>By tomorrow, I imagine he'll 
have forgotten Kastro's face.</i></b>

20:45.120 --> 20:46.890
<b><i>He doesn't associate with others.</i></b>

20:49.880 --> 20:53.190
<b><i>He's his own man.</i></b>

20:53.670 --> 20:55.650
<b><i>Because he believes himself</i></b>

20:56.030 --> 20:57.580
<b><i>to be the strongest.</i></b>

21:11.120 --> 21:14.130
<b>Oh, I forgot to remove this.</b>

21:18.400 --> 21:19.640
<b>Spider...</b>

21:21.880 --> 21:24.740
<b>I found some new toys to play with.</b>

21:26.610 --> 21:28.820
<b>I suppose it's time to start the hunt.</b>

21:38.090 --> 21:41.150
<b>Hisoka has been masquerading 
as a Phantom Troupe member.</b>

21:41.780 --> 21:47.020
<b>To him, the Phantom Troupe 
is simply another target.</b>

23:01.110 --> 23:06.150
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:01.110 --> 23:06.610
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.400 --> 23:02.950
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.950 --> 23:03.650
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.620 --> 23:07.470
<b>It's Gon</b>

23:07.470 --> 23:08.320
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.320 --> 23:09.610
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.650 --> 23:18.910
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.610 --> 23:11.530
Today, we introduce Kastro.

23:11.010 --> 23:13.740
<b>A 200s-class warrior.</b>

23:11.530 --> 23:12.790
He can use the Tiger Bite Fist.

23:12.790 --> 23:14.610
He can create a clone of himself with <i>Nen</i>.

23:13.740 --> 23:17.500
<b>Combines release and 
incarnation techniques,</b>

23:14.610 --> 23:16.150
Doubles are tough to deal with.

23:16.150 --> 23:18.770
With this double, I can use the real Tiger Bite Fist!

23:17.500 --> 23:19.830
<b>to duplicate himself.</b>

23:18.770 --> 23:20.170
The True Tiger Bite Fist!

23:24.920 --> 23:27.260
<b>Next time: An x Empty x Threat!</b>

23:27.260 --> 23:28.170
<b>Ah... Ah...</b>

23:28.170 --> 23:29.260
<b>Achoo!</b>

23:29.260 --> 23:30.520
<b>Do I have a cold?</b>

23:30.520 --> 23:33.080
<b>I bet someone's talking about you 
behind your back.</b>

23:33.080 --> 23:34.510
<b>Is it Mito-san?</b>
