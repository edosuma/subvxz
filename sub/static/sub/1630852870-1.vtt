Hey, girl!

03:43.703 --> 03:44.537
Hey!

03:45.640 --> 03:47.875
Oh my God, you're
finally here.

03:47.908 --> 03:49.810
I've missed you so much.

03:49.844 --> 03:51.278
Me too. Look at you!

03:51.312 --> 03:52.213
How was the drive?

03:52.246 --> 03:53.381
Oh, long.

03:53.415 --> 03:54.483
Oh, I bet.

03:54.516 --> 03:55.651
Wow.

03:55.684 --> 03:57.252
This house is huge!

03:57.285 --> 03:58.253
Oh you like it?

03:58.286 --> 03:59.122
Yes!

04:02.157 --> 04:02.993
Oh my God.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.430
Can you afford this?

04:06.463 --> 04:07.363
Nope.

04:07.397 --> 04:08.967
What's the catch?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.101
No catch.

04:10.135 --> 04:11.636
I found this woman online

04:11.670 --> 04:14.774
and she was looking for a
house sitter, so here I am.

04:14.807 --> 04:15.741
Shut up!

04:15.775 --> 04:16.575
I know.

04:16.608 --> 04:17.877
Wow.

04:19.577 --> 04:20.478
You okay?

04:20.512 --> 04:21.414
It must be real dusty in here.

04:21.447 --> 04:22.616
My chest is tightening up.

04:22.649 --> 04:24.651
Oh, I thought you
grew out of your asthma.

04:24.685 --> 04:26.486
Girl, please, I wish.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.422
- Wait a minute.
- What?

04:27.455 --> 04:28.388
Is that a pool?

04:28.423 --> 04:29.256
Mm-hmm.

04:29.289 --> 04:30.758
Oh my God.

04:30.792 --> 04:33.261
You officially just became
the luckiest sister I know.

04:43.106 --> 04:45.076
Where do you want
me to put this?

04:45.109 --> 04:47.445
Oh you can put it right
there, on the table.

04:47.478 --> 04:48.311
Okay.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.486
The place is looking great.

04:54.519 --> 04:55.620
Yeah!

04:55.654 --> 04:57.222
It's got a great vibe to it.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.959
It's got some kind
of vibe, I'm not sure what.

04:59.992 --> 05:02.629
An awesome one,
an amazing one.

05:02.663 --> 05:04.297
- If you say so.
- It does.

05:06.667 --> 05:07.668
I'm sorry.

05:07.701 --> 05:08.837
I must have set it on the edge.

05:08.870 --> 05:09.771
- I'm sorry.
- No.

05:09.804 --> 05:12.073
It's really not a big deal.

05:12.107 --> 05:14.008
It was a gift from Shane.

05:14.042 --> 05:15.276
Now, wait a minute.

05:15.310 --> 05:17.278
You said you got rid of
all the evidence of him.

05:17.312 --> 05:18.848
That was the last shred.

05:18.881 --> 05:19.715
Mm-hmm.

05:20.583 --> 05:21.417
It was.

05:22.986 --> 05:23.820
Okay.

05:24.654 --> 05:25.822
Can I ask you something?

05:25.856 --> 05:27.558
I mean, I know it's, you know,

05:27.592 --> 05:28.693
not my business or anything,

05:28.726 --> 05:31.496
but what did you
ever see in him?

05:31.529 --> 05:34.967
He was more
appealing from afar.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.302
Oh, I guess I
heard that before.

05:38.336 --> 05:39.205
Did you love him?

05:39.239 --> 05:40.073
No.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.307
But you know me.

05:42.341 --> 05:43.977
I mean, I'm not the
fall in love tight.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.179
Oh yeah, that's right.

05:45.212 --> 05:48.182
You're more of the give
it up too soon type.

05:49.415 --> 05:50.585
- Bitch!
- I'm just saying.

05:50.619 --> 05:51.953
- That is not true.
- Huh?

05:51.987 --> 05:52.988
- That's you.
- Me?

05:53.021 --> 05:53.922
Yeah, you.

05:53.955 --> 05:54.656
Well, I learned from the best.

05:55.957 --> 05:56.759
Mm-hmm.

05:56.793 --> 05:58.127
Okay.

06:04.268 --> 06:05.269
Oh my God.

06:10.307 --> 06:12.309
We should get this going again.

06:14.344 --> 06:15.346
What is that stuff?

06:15.380 --> 06:16.215
Spice.

06:16.248 --> 06:17.650
Synthetic weed.

06:17.683 --> 06:19.518
It's the new high.

06:27.028 --> 06:28.663
Oh, how's Charlie?

06:28.696 --> 06:30.298
You haven't talked
about him lately.

06:30.330 --> 06:31.532
Oh, Charlie.

06:31.566 --> 06:33.468
Hmm, well, he's dating.

06:35.904 --> 06:36.738
Who?

06:38.073 --> 06:39.909
Wit for it.

06:39.943 --> 06:41.544
Roxanne Reed.

06:41.578 --> 06:43.246
No. Butterface?

06:43.279 --> 06:44.548
Are you serious?

06:44.582 --> 06:45.482
She's such a slut.

06:45.516 --> 06:47.818
Oh, I cannot believe that.

06:48.853 --> 06:50.154
I just can't.

06:50.187 --> 06:51.723
I can't with guys right now.

06:51.756 --> 06:53.758
Speaking of done,
I'm done with this.

06:53.792 --> 06:56.494
Hmm, what time is it?

06:56.529 --> 06:57.997
Oh shit!

06:58.030 --> 06:59.098
Okay, I gotta go.

06:59.131 --> 07:00.333
What's wrong?

07:00.365 --> 07:02.434
Why don't you just
spend the night?

07:02.468 --> 07:04.004
I got to find a job so
I can get me one of these.

07:04.037 --> 07:04.905
Okay.

07:04.938 --> 07:06.840
Wait a minute.

07:06.874 --> 07:08.108
I know I'm not crazy.

07:08.141 --> 07:10.311
I know I put that
blue vase right there.

07:10.345 --> 07:11.546
I swear I did.

07:11.579 --> 07:14.850
Okay. No more spice
for you.

07:14.884 --> 07:16.785
Spice.

07:16.819 --> 07:18.287
All right,
girl, I'll see you later.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.221
I love you.

07:19.255 --> 07:20.022
I love you too.

07:20.055 --> 07:22.626
I'm so glad you're here.

07:22.659 --> 07:23.827
Let me walk you out.

07:23.860 --> 07:24.961
You know what? You
should not be driving.

07:24.995 --> 07:26.831
I'm fine.

09:08.816 --> 09:09.984
Who's there?

10:47.464 --> 10:49.099
Midtown
Rentals, can I help you?

10:49.133 --> 10:50.335
Yes. Hi.

10:50.368 --> 10:52.470
I just moved into
2525 Hill Street Road,

10:52.505 --> 10:55.940
and I just saw a mouse
running around my living room.

10:55.974 --> 10:57.176
I don't know how big
of a problem this is,

10:57.209 --> 10:59.145
but I really need it to go away.

10:59.178 --> 11:00.779
Oh, will anyone
be there at the property?

11:00.813 --> 11:02.047
Yeah, yeah, I'll be here.

11:02.081 --> 11:02.883
Okay, great.

11:02.916 --> 11:03.884
Thank you.

11:15.097 --> 11:16.533
Hi.

11:16.566 --> 11:17.466
Yes?

11:17.500 --> 11:19.468
You needed help, right?

11:20.370 --> 11:21.437
We're the help.

11:23.373 --> 11:25.441
The mouse in the house.

11:26.477 --> 11:29.046
Oh right, the exterminators.

11:29.079 --> 11:31.583
I'm Louie and this is Angel.

11:33.018 --> 11:36.622
We call ourselves
Pest Eradicators.

11:36.656 --> 11:38.056
Here's our state license.

11:38.089 --> 11:39.158
We're incorporated.

11:39.192 --> 11:39.992
Okay, yeah.

11:40.026 --> 11:41.294
Please come in.

11:41.327 --> 11:42.395
Nice house.

11:43.497 --> 11:44.331
Expensive.

11:58.747 --> 12:00.149
I hear movement.

12:00.182 --> 12:01.450
Hmm.

12:07.525 --> 12:10.828
You got a real, big
rodent problem here, ma'am.

12:10.861 --> 12:13.264
If I was you, I'd move out.

12:13.297 --> 12:15.367
How serious of
a problem is it?

12:15.400 --> 12:17.302
I'm sure it's nothing
we can't handle.

12:17.336 --> 12:18.705
I hope so.

12:18.737 --> 12:19.639
Uh, okay.

12:19.672 --> 12:20.974
I'm gonna be in the other room,

12:21.007 --> 12:23.009
so holler if you need me.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.579
Do you guys like
anything to drink?

12:25.613 --> 12:27.616
No, thank you.

12:27.649 --> 12:28.482
Okay.

12:31.252 --> 12:32.387
You know what, Louie.

12:32.420 --> 12:33.556
I'm thirsty!

12:33.589 --> 12:35.957
You can't be thirsty.

12:35.991 --> 12:37.660
You just real suggestible.

12:37.693 --> 12:39.829
But that ain't the point.

12:39.862 --> 12:43.332
You never ask me
what I want, ever.

12:43.366 --> 12:45.536
And you disrespected me
in front of that lady.

12:45.570 --> 12:48.338
I don't like this
job you got us doing.

12:48.372 --> 12:52.645
"Ooh, don't worry, ma'am, it
ain't nothing we can't handle."

12:52.678 --> 12:54.513
What kind of shit is that?

12:54.546 --> 12:57.116
But she's a nice lady.

12:57.149 --> 12:58.984
We should help her.

12:59.018 --> 13:02.590
Well, if you're
thirsty, go ask her.

13:02.623 --> 13:03.624
I'm working.

13:05.091 --> 13:06.359
Well, I...

13:06.393 --> 13:07.794
Just not do that.

13:09.564 --> 13:12.668
Angel, I
need you up here!

13:12.701 --> 13:15.304
You need to come with us.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.005
You don't belong here.

13:17.039 --> 13:18.340
We don't
make the rules.

13:18.373 --> 13:21.779
We're just trying to
be cordial and help.

13:21.811 --> 13:24.213
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

13:24.247 --> 13:25.716
You can't stay here.

13:25.749 --> 13:30.254
There's nothing for you here
except to bother the girl.

13:37.128 --> 13:39.666
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

13:45.372 --> 13:47.307
Are you okay?

13:47.341 --> 13:48.375
Mm. Mm-hmm.

13:48.408 --> 13:49.242
Mm-hmm.

13:59.522 --> 14:01.423
We'll be back in
a few days, ma'am,

14:01.457 --> 14:03.293
to check on the traps.

14:04.662 --> 14:08.533
No one is ever truly
alone in their home, ma'am.

14:08.567 --> 14:11.536
As long as common
sense prevails,

14:11.570 --> 14:13.504
you should have no
further problems.

14:17.677 --> 14:18.510
Hmm.

15:03.864 --> 15:04.665
Yes?

15:04.698 --> 15:05.866
Ola, chiquita.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.167
The office sent me.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.870
They said you got
a rodent problem.

15:08.904 --> 15:10.371
Oh, um,

15:10.404 --> 15:13.809
some other guys were already
here and they took care of it.

15:13.842 --> 15:16.679
So you don't need my help?

15:16.712 --> 15:17.647
No, I'm, I'm good.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.513
Thank you.

15:28.525 --> 15:30.595
Hold for one moment, please.

15:30.628 --> 15:32.095
Hi, I'm Lisa Wagner,

15:32.130 --> 15:33.298
I'm here to see Mr. Buntley.

15:33.331 --> 15:34.399
Do you have an appointment?

15:34.432 --> 15:35.634
No, um,

15:35.668 --> 15:38.036
but could you see that
he gets this CD, please?

15:38.069 --> 15:40.005
I'm sorry. We
can't accept that.

15:40.039 --> 15:42.975
All submissions come from
a registered talent agent.

15:43.008 --> 15:44.745
Do you have an agent?

15:45.713 --> 15:46.881
No.

15:46.914 --> 15:47.915
I'm sorry.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.518
Hey, hi, sorry-

15:55.924 --> 15:56.826
- Can I help you?

15:56.860 --> 15:58.494
I'm here to see Mr. Wilson.

15:58.527 --> 15:59.929
Do you have an appointment?

15:59.963 --> 16:02.499
No, um, I just, I
wanted to give him my CD.

16:02.532 --> 16:04.602
Uh, give me one second.

16:06.770 --> 16:10.508
Ben, there's someone
here to see Mr. Wilson.

16:10.542 --> 16:11.877
Okay.

16:11.910 --> 16:13.511
Go and have a seat,
he'll be right out.

16:13.545 --> 16:15.180
Okay, thanks.

16:20.018 --> 16:21.254
Ms. Wagner?

16:22.188 --> 16:23.089
Mr. Wilson.

16:23.122 --> 16:24.223
No, I'm Ben, his assistant.

16:24.257 --> 16:25.592
How may I assist you?

16:25.626 --> 16:26.527
Oh, I just, I wanted-

16:26.561 --> 16:28.061
- Hey, Jerry, yeah.

16:28.095 --> 16:29.062
No, no, no, no.

16:29.096 --> 16:29.864
Dude, don't pull
me in this, man.

16:29.898 --> 16:31.098
You know she gets.

16:31.131 --> 16:32.000
I just wanted
to give him my CD.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.468
I'm sorry.

16:33.501 --> 16:34.670
Mr. Wilson prefers to hear
new clients play live.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.237
Do you have a gig we
can come hear you play?

16:36.271 --> 16:37.171
No, no yet, but-

16:37.205 --> 16:38.340
- Of course not. Hold on.

16:38.374 --> 16:39.542
Look, get a gig and
then give me a call,

16:39.576 --> 16:40.376
we'll come see you, okay?

16:40.409 --> 16:41.745
Okay, thanks. Bye.

16:41.778 --> 16:42.946
Yeah, sorry about that, man.

16:42.979 --> 16:44.982
- Oh, um, do you validate?
- No.

16:45.016 --> 16:46.751
You won't believe
these people sometimes.

16:46.784 --> 16:49.286
Yeah, so get there
tomorrow, it's all gonna-

16:49.319 --> 16:50.154
- Thank you.

16:59.264 --> 17:00.567
Big Al Boswell.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.868
You book acts, right?

17:01.901 --> 17:05.104
Book, manage, talent
scout, I do it all.

17:05.137 --> 17:06.906
You, uh, you a musician?

17:06.941 --> 17:09.209
Yeah, yeah, this is me.

17:09.242 --> 17:10.377
I need to showcase,

17:10.411 --> 17:12.246
and I will play for free.

17:12.279 --> 17:14.082
I understand, I, I really do.

17:14.115 --> 17:15.550
But I got a lot
of overhead here.

17:15.585 --> 17:17.484
I can't book an act unless
they got a record deal

17:17.519 --> 17:19.287
or a large following.

17:20.723 --> 17:21.925
I tell you what I'll do.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.560
Listen, I'll give you
a job as a waitress.

17:23.594 --> 17:25.929
I get a lot of industry
people through here,

17:25.963 --> 17:28.531
network, schmooze, right?

17:28.566 --> 17:29.901
Don't answer right now.

17:29.934 --> 17:31.703
Think about it.

17:31.736 --> 17:33.538
I'll give it a listen,

17:33.572 --> 17:35.574
maybe I can, uh, pass
it on to somebody.

17:35.608 --> 17:36.407
Thank you.

17:36.441 --> 17:37.342
I appreciate that.

17:37.375 --> 17:38.377
All right.

17:53.695 --> 17:54.495
Hey, Tiff.

17:54.528 --> 17:55.731
Hey, girl.

17:55.764 --> 17:57.165
Any luck on finding a job?

17:57.199 --> 17:59.267
Hmm, no, not today.

17:59.301 --> 18:00.103
How about you?

18:00.135 --> 18:01.671
Any luck?

18:01.704 --> 18:03.172
Oh, I went on
this audition today.

18:03.206 --> 18:04.642
But I don't know, I just,

18:04.675 --> 18:06.110
I didn't feel prepared.

18:06.175 --> 18:08.046
I don't feel as pretty
as the rest of the girls,

18:08.079 --> 18:09.614
and I just wanted
to run to my car.

18:09.648 --> 18:11.883
Listen, you are a
gifted actress, Tiff,

18:11.916 --> 18:13.417
and you're smoking hot.

18:13.450 --> 18:14.720
Thanks, friend.

18:14.754 --> 18:16.254
Oh, and speaking of smoking,

18:16.287 --> 18:18.791
that spice stuff we
smoked the other night

18:18.824 --> 18:19.993
gave me nightmares.

18:20.027 --> 18:21.193
Tell me about it.

18:21.227 --> 18:22.629
All night I was
hearing piano music,

18:22.663 --> 18:23.997
I thought I was hallucinating.

18:24.031 --> 18:25.565
I threw it out.

18:25.599 --> 18:26.701
Hmm. Weird.

18:28.268 --> 18:29.937
Well, what you feeling like?

18:29.971 --> 18:30.905
Dinner, movie?

18:30.938 --> 18:33.142
Mm, can we do it tomorrow?

18:33.174 --> 18:34.009
Fine.

18:35.044 --> 18:35.844
All right.

18:35.878 --> 18:36.679
Well, call me tomorrow.

18:36.712 --> 18:37.512
Awesome.

19:34.445 --> 19:37.216
I only saw him for a second.

19:37.248 --> 19:40.820
I woke up, and there he was
just sitting in a chair.

19:40.854 --> 19:43.623
And then I screamed
and he ran off.

19:43.656 --> 19:45.558
He was sitting in a chair?

19:45.593 --> 19:47.628
Yeah, just staring at me.

19:47.661 --> 19:48.929
Can you describe him?

19:48.963 --> 19:50.065
Young, 20s.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.669
He was white; really,
really, white.

19:54.703 --> 19:56.639
Have you ever seen him before?

19:56.672 --> 19:57.539
No.

20:05.082 --> 20:06.250
I looked everywhere upstairs

20:06.282 --> 20:08.820
and there's no sign
of forced entry.

20:08.853 --> 20:10.955
There's no disturbance
of any kind,

20:10.989 --> 20:12.657
but I did find this.

20:13.893 --> 20:15.060
Is that yours?

20:17.029 --> 20:17.863
No.

20:21.268 --> 20:22.636
It must be his then.

20:22.669 --> 20:23.770
It must be.

20:25.839 --> 20:27.041
All right.

20:27.074 --> 20:28.575
Detective Morrison and
I will file report;

20:28.609 --> 20:31.344
that way if you call again,
we'll know what to look for.

20:31.378 --> 20:32.247
We're good here?

20:32.281 --> 20:33.115
Mm-hmm.

20:45.763 --> 20:46.664
Who is it?

20:46.697 --> 20:48.098
It's me.

20:53.738 --> 20:55.006
Hey, are you okay?

20:55.040 --> 20:56.309
No.

20:56.341 --> 20:57.542
What's wrong?

20:59.612 --> 21:00.813
I don't know.

21:07.287 --> 21:08.723
What's going on?

21:08.756 --> 21:09.958
I don't know. I don't know.

21:09.991 --> 21:12.861
I, I've never seen
him before in my life,

21:12.894 --> 21:14.129
and then he was in my bedroom,

21:14.163 --> 21:15.297
he was just staring at me.

21:15.331 --> 21:16.031
Wait, wait, wait.

21:16.065 --> 21:17.266
Who? He?

21:17.299 --> 21:18.200
What, what?

21:19.068 --> 21:20.003
This man.

21:21.037 --> 21:22.272
I don't know.

21:23.273 --> 21:24.808
Did he do anything to you?

21:24.841 --> 21:25.675
No.

21:26.576 --> 21:29.080
No, he just stared at me.

21:29.113 --> 21:31.249
Oh, and you called
the PD, right?

21:31.282 --> 21:32.718
Yeah.

21:32.751 --> 21:34.319
But by the time they showed
up, he was already gone.

21:34.353 --> 21:37.222
Oh, I don't even know
where to start with this.

21:37.256 --> 21:40.226
Um, you're staying here tonight.

21:40.260 --> 21:42.494
And tomorrow we can, um,

21:42.527 --> 21:44.530
we can both go back to your
house and check things out,

21:44.564 --> 21:45.366
okay?

21:45.398 --> 21:46.233
Okay.

22:07.357 --> 22:08.293
Hold on. Stay here.

22:08.326 --> 22:09.861
Mm-hmm.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.568
Nobody's here.

22:17.603 --> 22:20.173
I mean, do you just want
me to just hang around

22:20.206 --> 22:21.573
for a few days or
something like that

22:21.608 --> 22:23.009
till you're comfortable?

22:24.044 --> 22:24.945
No, girl.

22:24.978 --> 22:26.113
Are you crazy? You have asthma.

22:26.147 --> 22:28.282
Okay, inhalers. I'll be fine.

22:28.316 --> 22:30.685
Tiff, you worry way
too much about me.

22:30.718 --> 22:31.619
I'm fine.

22:31.652 --> 22:32.553
First you're freaking out,

22:32.586 --> 22:33.622
now you're not freaking out,

22:33.655 --> 22:34.756
that freaks me out.

22:36.625 --> 22:37.760
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

22:37.794 --> 22:39.461
- Okay?
- All right.

22:39.494 --> 22:40.495
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:42.031 --> 22:43.032
- Okay.
- Let me show you out.

22:43.066 --> 22:43.867
I got it.

22:43.901 --> 22:44.802
Okay.

22:44.835 --> 22:45.936
No crazy business.

22:55.848 --> 22:56.849
Try B flat.

22:59.517 --> 23:00.518
Oh my God!

23:01.387 --> 23:02.289
I have a gun.

23:02.322 --> 23:03.991
Sure you do.

23:04.024 --> 23:05.392
Who are you?

23:05.425 --> 23:06.994
My name is Eddie.

23:07.027 --> 23:09.197
Nice to meet you.

23:09.230 --> 23:10.631
This is my house.

23:10.665 --> 23:11.866
Now, please leave.

23:11.899 --> 23:14.636
How did
you get in here?

23:15.904 --> 23:16.672
I live here.

23:18.674 --> 23:22.112
You can stay the night,
just be out by the morning.

23:37.697 --> 23:39.531
Detective Morrison, please.

23:44.471 --> 23:45.873
Thank you for coming.

23:45.906 --> 23:47.241
Where is he?

23:47.274 --> 23:48.976
He's upstairs in the attic.

23:49.009 --> 23:50.011
All right.

24:06.763 --> 24:09.700
Hey, Lisa, ain't nobody in here.

24:09.734 --> 24:10.567
What?

24:11.568 --> 24:13.404
Ain't nobody in here.

24:13.438 --> 24:15.274
Are you sure you saw
him come to the attic?

24:15.307 --> 24:16.141
Yes. Yes.

24:17.142 --> 24:18.777
Well, it's not the first time

24:18.811 --> 24:21.580
we've been celled
up to this house.

24:21.613 --> 24:24.784
I've been here myself
a couple times,

24:24.818 --> 24:26.320
never saw nothing.

24:27.788 --> 24:28.956
There he is.

24:29.857 --> 24:30.891
There he is.

24:30.925 --> 24:31.827
Where?

24:31.860 --> 24:32.994
He's, he's right there.

24:33.028 --> 24:33.862
He's right there
on the piano bench.

24:33.895 --> 24:35.230
Can't you see him?

24:43.339 --> 24:46.944
There's nobody in
here except you and me.

24:48.745 --> 24:49.580
What?

24:51.683 --> 24:53.785
He's, he's right there.

24:56.122 --> 24:57.389
He's right next to you.

24:57.423 --> 24:58.657
He's right there.

24:58.691 --> 25:01.962
You know, you got to
get off of the spice.

25:01.995 --> 25:03.263
I know it's legal now,

25:03.296 --> 25:06.133
but, uh, it's
making you paranoid.

25:08.002 --> 25:11.405
Listen, uh, I'll do
me a favor, okay, kid?

25:11.439 --> 25:14.376
I'm not even gonna
make a report.

25:14.409 --> 25:15.911
But...

25:15.944 --> 25:16.845
What?

25:16.879 --> 25:19.314
He's waving at me.

25:19.348 --> 25:20.150
Let's go.

25:20.183 --> 25:21.351
It's all right.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.139
Thank you, Detective.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.444
Listen, uh, get some sleep.

25:45.913 --> 25:47.247
Stay off the K2.

26:14.780 --> 26:17.516
That disappearing act you
did was very, very clever.

26:17.549 --> 26:20.119
What are you, a
magician or something?

26:20.153 --> 26:21.921
I'm not moving out!

26:23.156 --> 26:26.527
Perhaps I didn't
make myself clear.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.796
Please get out of my house.

26:33.235 --> 26:34.035
Now!

27:03.303 --> 27:04.204
No, no, no.

27:05.939 --> 27:06.773
No, no.

27:06.806 --> 27:07.743
No.

27:18.120 --> 27:18.920
Oh God!

27:18.954 --> 27:20.023
Where am I?

27:21.190 --> 27:22.425
Where am I?

27:22.458 --> 27:23.293
Don't.

27:25.261 --> 27:26.363
Please don't.

27:27.931 --> 27:29.701
What's happening to me?

27:29.734 --> 27:32.837
You have to go back, please.

27:32.871 --> 27:35.440
You have to go back, now.

27:49.289 --> 27:50.124
Hey.

27:52.327 --> 27:53.127
Shh.

27:53.161 --> 27:54.195
Don't be frightened.

27:54.228 --> 27:55.063
I'm sorry.

27:56.198 --> 27:58.434
I never meant for
things to go this far.

27:58.467 --> 27:59.736
You'll be okay.

28:02.172 --> 28:03.006
Lisa!

28:04.240 --> 28:05.342
Girl, what are you doing?

28:05.375 --> 28:06.643
I've been calling you for hours?

28:06.677 --> 28:08.312
The movie was sold out.

28:08.346 --> 28:09.781
What is going on with your face?

28:09.815 --> 28:12.917
I think I fell
down the stairs.

28:12.950 --> 28:14.486
Oh, I have a nasty headache.

28:14.519 --> 28:16.521
Um, you think?

28:16.555 --> 28:17.790
Okay, I'm taking
you to the doctor.

28:17.824 --> 28:19.057
No, no, no, no, no, no.

28:19.091 --> 28:21.594
Uh, no, I'm taking
you to the ER, okay?

28:22.562 --> 28:23.396
Okay.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.664
Excuse me.

28:58.203 --> 28:59.271
You can see?

28:59.304 --> 29:00.139
Yeah.

29:01.273 --> 29:02.275
So can he.

29:03.176 --> 29:04.310
Who are you, guys?

29:04.344 --> 29:07.414
I'm Louie and this is Angel.

29:07.448 --> 29:08.249
Hi.

29:08.282 --> 29:09.718
We're here to help.

29:09.751 --> 29:11.853
Thank you, but I
don't need any help.

29:11.887 --> 29:14.589
But that's not
the point, Eddie.

29:14.623 --> 29:15.725
You know my name.

29:15.758 --> 29:18.293
Oh, we know
everything about you.

29:18.326 --> 29:19.730
You know everything?

29:19.763 --> 29:21.397
Everything.

29:21.431 --> 29:24.267
See, we're soul collectors.

29:24.300 --> 29:27.371
We're here to guide you
to your next port of call.

29:27.404 --> 29:29.173
Thank you.

29:29.206 --> 29:31.710
But I'm very happy here.

29:38.752 --> 29:42.588
Angel and I been doing
this for a long time,

29:44.558 --> 29:46.226
we're professionals.

29:47.695 --> 29:50.298
We understand how you feel.

29:50.331 --> 29:52.233
But like anything,

29:52.266 --> 29:55.269
there are the rules
you gotta follow

29:56.171 --> 29:57.506
or shit happens,

30:00.209 --> 30:02.645
then things get out of hand.

30:02.680 --> 30:03.914
It was an accident.

30:03.948 --> 30:05.816
No, it wasn't.

30:05.850 --> 30:07.853
Eddie, you spoke to her.

30:09.019 --> 30:11.890
Eddie, you don't belong here.

30:11.923 --> 30:13.893
It's time to move on.

30:13.926 --> 30:15.360
But I'm not ready.

30:15.393 --> 30:17.697
We can't force you to leave;

30:17.730 --> 30:21.334
but if you wanna stay,
you better behave.

30:24.170 --> 30:25.874
I'll see you later.

30:30.410 --> 30:33.314
You ought to do what he says.

30:33.348 --> 30:35.083
I would if I was you.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.006
Lisa Wagner.

30:54.071 --> 30:55.306
Yeah, that's me.

30:55.340 --> 30:56.375
You fell down a
flight of stairs?

30:56.408 --> 30:57.342
Yeah.

30:57.376 --> 30:58.310
Do you have any idea

30:58.343 --> 30:59.044
how long you were unconscious?

30:59.077 --> 31:00.379
No.

31:00.412 --> 31:03.149
Any change
in speech or vision?

31:03.182 --> 31:04.584
No.

31:04.617 --> 31:06.185
A loss of feelings
in your legs or arms?

31:06.219 --> 31:07.454
No.

31:07.488 --> 31:10.692
All right. Let's
have a look at you.

31:10.725 --> 31:12.626
Look straight at me,
don't move your head,

31:12.660 --> 31:13.662
follow the light.

31:59.749 --> 32:00.883
Hey.

32:00.917 --> 32:01.752
Hi.

32:01.785 --> 32:03.252
How you feeling?

32:03.286 --> 32:04.687
Much better today.

32:04.722 --> 32:05.521
Good.

32:06.724 --> 32:08.626
So, what are your plans?

32:08.659 --> 32:10.494
I think I'm gonna
go to the house

32:10.527 --> 32:12.596
and get some clean clothes,

32:12.630 --> 32:13.733
get my mail.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.067
Um, no, ma'am.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.334
I will be going to your house,

32:16.368 --> 32:17.569
getting your mail
and your clothes,

32:17.602 --> 32:18.871
you gonna be staying
here and chilling.

32:18.904 --> 32:20.306
Tiff, seriously?

32:20.339 --> 32:22.341
I've been sitting in this house
for way too long and my...

32:22.375 --> 32:24.143
I can feel my,
it's getting flat.

32:24.176 --> 32:25.512
You are crazy.

32:26.981 --> 32:29.216
Look, I have an audition in
Hollywood at three o'clock.

32:29.249 --> 32:30.217
I'll see you later.

32:30.250 --> 32:31.184
All right. Good luck.

32:31.218 --> 32:31.887
- Love you.
- All right.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.187
Love you too.

32:38.862 --> 32:41.798
Today we
commemorate the untimely death

32:41.831 --> 32:44.300
of piano virtuoso, Eddie Conway.

32:44.334 --> 32:47.071
He died in 1969
at the age of 20.

33:09.097 --> 33:10.865
Don't be frightened, please.

33:10.899 --> 33:12.934
Don't be frightened.

33:12.967 --> 33:15.270
I'm not going to hurt you.

33:15.303 --> 33:17.405
Are you all right?

33:17.439 --> 33:19.442
Look, it's pretty
weird for me too.

33:19.475 --> 33:22.813
I didn't exactly plan
my death this way.

33:27.018 --> 33:29.754
Did you find a
new place to live?

33:29.787 --> 33:33.224
You could stay here if you want.

33:33.257 --> 33:35.693
Those things will kill you.

33:37.931 --> 33:39.799
Would your care
for a cup of tea?

33:47.942 --> 33:49.009
Do you take sugar?

33:49.043 --> 33:50.145
No.

33:56.651 --> 33:57.486
Thank you.

34:02.960 --> 34:03.861
How's the tea?

34:03.894 --> 34:05.129
It's very good.

34:05.162 --> 34:06.730
I'm very glad you like it.

34:06.764 --> 34:08.465
Do you like this house?

34:08.498 --> 34:11.235
Yeah, it has a
great vibe to it.

34:11.268 --> 34:13.239
It does, doesn't it?

34:13.271 --> 34:15.007
I designed it myself.

34:16.341 --> 34:19.011
It's quite ahead of its time.

34:19.043 --> 34:22.215
Everything good I ever
did comes from here.

34:22.248 --> 34:23.984
How long have you been here?

34:24.016 --> 34:25.118
Since 1969.

34:27.955 --> 34:29.688
What day is it today?

34:30.590 --> 34:32.995
It's Wednesday, April 25th,

34:35.964 --> 34:37.498
2013.

34:37.533 --> 34:38.534
2000 what?

34:45.176 --> 34:47.210
Are you hungry?

34:47.244 --> 34:48.245
I'm sorry?

34:49.413 --> 34:51.783
I'm going down to
get something to eat.

34:51.817 --> 34:52.650
Can you eat?

34:52.683 --> 34:53.918
Yes, I think.

34:55.085 --> 34:56.121
Okay.

34:56.155 --> 34:57.489
Would you like to join me?

34:57.522 --> 34:58.590
I can't.

34:58.623 --> 35:00.059
Why not.

35:01.494 --> 35:03.764
I can't leave this house.

35:06.432 --> 35:08.236
Have you ever tried?

35:09.237 --> 35:10.537
No.

35:10.571 --> 35:14.375
Well, there's a first
time for everything.

35:18.646 --> 35:20.583
You can do it.

35:21.918 --> 35:23.485
It's okay.

35:49.918 --> 35:50.752
I can't.

35:51.887 --> 35:52.720
Sorry.

35:53.654 --> 35:54.655
It's okay.

35:56.625 --> 35:57.827
I'll go get the food.

35:57.860 --> 35:59.527
What would you like?

36:01.265 --> 36:03.333
I'll have whatever
you're having.

36:03.367 --> 36:04.201
Okay.

36:05.468 --> 36:06.569
I'll be back.

36:10.942 --> 36:13.212
Hey, Lisa.

36:13.245 --> 36:14.079
Shane?

36:15.114 --> 36:16.315
What are you doing in L.A.?

36:16.348 --> 36:17.950
What happened to our face?

36:17.983 --> 36:20.287
Nothing, I slipped.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.055
How did you find me?

36:22.088 --> 36:23.489
Does it really matter.

36:28.896 --> 36:30.597
I got to go, okay?

36:30.630 --> 36:31.767
Can we talk?

36:31.800 --> 36:32.700
I gotta go.

36:32.733 --> 36:35.070
I can't, I can't do this.

37:26.163 --> 37:27.465
I'm sorry.

37:27.497 --> 37:29.300
I didn't mean to scare you.

37:30.401 --> 37:31.770
Please don't do that again.

37:31.803 --> 37:33.571
I won't. I promise.

37:36.208 --> 37:38.144
I got you some tacos.

37:42.315 --> 37:43.150
Hmm.

37:44.885 --> 37:45.718
Hmm.

37:47.955 --> 37:48.889
- Hmm.
- Good?

37:50.458 --> 37:52.794
I had forgotten
how good a taco is.

37:52.827 --> 37:53.862
Do you want a beer with that?

37:53.895 --> 37:54.728
Yes.

38:04.508 --> 38:05.308
Thank you.

38:05.342 --> 38:06.176
Yeah.

38:10.048 --> 38:11.049
Mm.

38:14.685 --> 38:15.521
Mm.

38:16.455 --> 38:17.289
Mm.

38:23.296 --> 38:24.130
Wow!

38:28.701 --> 38:29.537
Mm.

38:33.641 --> 38:34.810
What?

38:34.843 --> 38:36.710
Do I have food on my face?

38:36.744 --> 38:38.613
You can eat?

38:38.647 --> 38:39.482
Yes.

38:40.349 --> 38:41.150
You can drink.

38:41.184 --> 38:42.085
You can smoke.

38:42.118 --> 38:43.454
I can walk through walls.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.089
I don't age.

38:45.122 --> 38:47.291
I don't feel pain.

38:47.324 --> 38:49.760
I can be seen or not seen
depending on my preference.

38:49.794 --> 38:53.630
The only thing I can't
do is leave this house.

38:56.135 --> 38:56.969
Huh.

38:58.304 --> 38:59.438
Tell me about you.

38:59.472 --> 39:00.306
Me?

39:01.174 --> 39:02.309
Um,

39:02.342 --> 39:03.143
like what?

39:03.176 --> 39:04.077
Everything.

39:04.111 --> 39:04.945
Something.

39:05.879 --> 39:06.880
Anything.

39:08.483 --> 39:09.317
Okay.

39:10.551 --> 39:12.719
I'm 21, singer-songwriter.

39:14.689 --> 39:18.360
I love rock and
roll, and old movies,

39:18.393 --> 39:20.762
and classic American cars.

39:22.731 --> 39:24.467
I believe that everything
that happens to me

39:24.501 --> 39:26.971
is either by luck or accident,

39:27.004 --> 39:30.942
never as I plan it.

39:30.976 --> 39:32.544
How about you?

39:32.577 --> 39:33.411
Hmm.

39:38.184 --> 39:41.254
I started playing
piano at age four,

39:41.287 --> 39:44.558
composed my first
concerto at 12,

39:44.591 --> 39:48.328
won the Van Cliburn
Piano Competition at 14,

39:48.362 --> 39:50.398
got a hit record at 17.

39:50.431 --> 39:54.701
I love strawberries and
Blue Bell ice cream.

39:54.735 --> 39:58.140
They still have
Blue Bell ice cream?

39:58.174 --> 39:59.008
Yeah.

40:00.242 --> 40:01.244
Are you in a band?

40:01.278 --> 40:02.112
No.

40:03.246 --> 40:05.482
I love writing songs
for other people.

40:05.515 --> 40:07.318
Could I hear one?

40:07.351 --> 40:08.186
Now?

40:09.719 --> 40:11.789
I'm not going anywhere.

40:11.822 --> 40:12.657
Okay.

40:14.092 --> 40:18.197
I wrote this one when
I was in high school.

40:32.914 --> 40:35.250
♪ Like a summer day ♪

40:35.283 --> 40:38.854
♪ You came and went away ♪

40:38.888 --> 40:43.894
♪ Much too fast ♪

40:44.995 --> 40:49.334
♪ Tell me when you'll
be back again ♪

40:49.367 --> 40:54.372
♪ How long can this last ♪

40:55.407 --> 40:59.777
♪ I missed you today ♪

40:59.812 --> 41:04.783
♪ I missed what you might
do and what you might say ♪

41:06.553 --> 41:11.525
♪ And even though
you had to go away ♪

41:13.662 --> 41:18.567
♪ I wanted you to know
I missed you today ♪

41:35.687 --> 41:38.090
That's beautiful.

41:38.124 --> 41:40.159
It was raw, it was heartfelt.

41:40.192 --> 41:41.460
Can I hear another one?

41:41.494 --> 41:44.598
Tonight I have
plans, but tomorrow?

41:46.033 --> 41:48.735
Tomorrow is a long time.

41:48.769 --> 41:50.271
Goodnight, Eddie

41:52.640 --> 41:54.409
Goodnight.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.766
Lisa, this
is getting serious.

42:14.800 --> 42:15.901
You don't believe me.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.003
I mean, I w, I want to.

42:19.172 --> 42:20.907
But you gotta admit,
this sounds crazy.

42:20.940 --> 42:24.610
I mean, some pianist
that died 40 years ago?

42:26.146 --> 42:27.581
Have you told
anybody about this?

42:27.614 --> 42:29.183
- No.
- Oh good.

42:29.216 --> 42:31.152
They'd probably
think you were crazy.

42:31.186 --> 42:33.221
Like you're looking
at me right now?

42:33.254 --> 42:34.556
Kinda.

42:34.589 --> 42:37.860
I mean, what does
this ghost look like?

42:38.794 --> 42:40.596
He's handsome, sexy,

42:43.500 --> 42:47.070
with these beautiful
grayish-greenish eyes.

42:48.271 --> 42:50.108
You have a crush.

42:50.141 --> 42:51.810
No, Tiff, he's a ghost.

42:51.844 --> 42:53.044
Oh, really?

42:53.077 --> 42:55.948
Well, that should
pose a problem.

42:55.981 --> 42:58.183
But I guess we have seen worse.

42:59.051 --> 43:00.686
It's...

43:00.719 --> 43:02.956
Have you ever considered
calling Ghostbusters?

43:02.989 --> 43:06.693
I'm sorry.

43:06.727 --> 43:07.762
That's not funny.

43:07.795 --> 43:09.096
It is!

43:09.130 --> 43:10.598
Not funny.

43:10.631 --> 43:13.969
Listen, you're my best
friend and I love you, Lisa,

43:14.002 --> 43:15.704
but people that
believe in ghosts

43:15.737 --> 43:18.140
normally have like real issues,

43:18.173 --> 43:19.675
like suicidal thoughts,

43:19.709 --> 43:20.777
there's drugs involved,

43:20.810 --> 43:21.978
it's a whole moment.

43:22.011 --> 43:23.513
And, I, I don't think
you're like that.

43:23.546 --> 43:25.182
I mean, are you...

43:25.215 --> 43:26.150
I was just...

43:26.183 --> 43:27.351
You're right. You're right.

43:27.384 --> 43:28.952
I know I'm right.

43:30.320 --> 43:31.756
Hmm.

43:31.790 --> 43:34.592
So, you know that guy
I was telling you about?

43:34.626 --> 43:35.828
Which one?

43:35.861 --> 43:37.062
Adrian.

43:37.096 --> 43:39.298
Oh, the cute one
from the soap opera?

43:39.331 --> 43:40.232
Yeah.

43:40.266 --> 43:43.170
Well, he is...

43:43.203 --> 43:45.238
Ooh, look at you.

43:45.272 --> 43:47.774
Ooh, I cannot wait
to get a piece of that.

43:47.808 --> 43:50.144
You are such a skank
and you're mental.

43:50.178 --> 43:51.646
Wait a minute.

43:51.679 --> 43:56.151
You have new ghost friends
and I'm the mental one?

43:56.185 --> 43:57.019
Cuckoo.

44:36.164 --> 44:37.766
It's a beautiful.

44:39.001 --> 44:40.369
One of yours?

44:40.402 --> 44:41.237
Yes.

44:44.374 --> 44:46.109
I'm glad you're here.

44:48.779 --> 44:51.649
Are you staying this time?

44:51.682 --> 44:54.185
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

44:54.218 --> 44:55.053
Why not?

44:57.089 --> 44:58.624
Have you ever had
a roommate, Eddie?

44:58.657 --> 44:59.491
A few,

45:00.928 --> 45:04.564
but I didn't like them very
much so I made them leave.

45:04.597 --> 45:05.431
Why?

45:06.968 --> 45:10.704
They were loud,
disruptive, unappreciative.

45:12.909 --> 45:16.711
Well, what changed
your mind about me?

45:16.745 --> 45:18.413
Self-condemnation.

45:19.782 --> 45:22.853
My juvenile behavior
almost cost you your life

45:22.886 --> 45:26.024
then I realized that
this is your home,

45:26.056 --> 45:27.624
and now I'm the trespasser.

45:27.658 --> 45:31.362
Besides you have moxie
and attitude, spunk.

45:32.764 --> 45:33.899
I must tell you,

45:33.933 --> 45:34.900
when you were waving
that poker at me,

45:34.934 --> 45:36.401
I was truly terrified.

45:37.469 --> 45:39.572
I'm sorry about that.

45:39.605 --> 45:41.173
I thought you were a squatter.

45:41.206 --> 45:42.474
I wish I was,

45:43.911 --> 45:47.414
then I would have had
the choice to leave.

45:55.757 --> 45:59.896
You know, I've never shown
myself to anyone except you.

46:00.864 --> 46:02.066
Why?

46:02.098 --> 46:03.566
I don't know.

46:03.600 --> 46:04.767
I truly don't.

46:06.436 --> 46:08.706
Eddie, if I stay,

46:08.739 --> 46:11.709
no more poof you're here
and poof you're there,

46:11.742 --> 46:13.545
it spooks me.

46:13.578 --> 46:14.713
This is your room.

46:14.746 --> 46:16.314
I don't want you
hanging around a mine

46:16.348 --> 46:19.118
being all invisible and stuff,

46:19.151 --> 46:20.620
it creeps me out.

46:20.653 --> 46:23.456
You're taking all the
fun out of being a ghost.

46:33.501 --> 46:35.770
I'm good with that.

46:35.803 --> 46:37.107
Good.

46:37.139 --> 46:38.374
Then I'll stay.

46:38.407 --> 46:39.441
Wonderful.

46:39.475 --> 46:40.576
Let's celebrate.

46:40.609 --> 46:41.610
Celebrate?

46:42.679 --> 46:43.914
Where did that come from?

46:43.948 --> 46:44.849
My agent.

46:46.017 --> 46:47.684
He told me to let it age.

46:47.717 --> 46:49.121
To your new home.

46:58.797 --> 46:59.932
Remember when you
first moved in,

46:59.966 --> 47:02.069
you were messing around
with a few chords?

47:02.102 --> 47:03.336
Well, I played with
them a little bit

47:03.369 --> 47:07.307
and I added a few of
my own and a melody.

47:07.341 --> 47:08.742
Would you like to hear it?

47:08.776 --> 47:09.610
Yeah.

47:58.834 --> 47:59.668
Wow.

48:00.703 --> 48:01.972
Do you like it?

48:02.005 --> 48:02.839
Yeah.

48:04.340 --> 48:07.411
I just, I thought you
were a concert pianist.

48:07.444 --> 48:08.278
I am.

48:09.713 --> 48:11.715
But I also love rock and roll.

48:11.749 --> 48:14.652
Truth be told, I always
wanted to be in a rock band.

48:14.686 --> 48:16.021
Music is music.

48:16.055 --> 48:17.822
There are little differences.

48:17.856 --> 48:19.525
Rock and roll is fun,

48:19.558 --> 48:22.162
you play to thousands
of screaming fans,

48:22.195 --> 48:23.997
there's so much
energy and enthusiasm,

48:24.030 --> 48:25.900
eclecticism to feed on.

48:25.933 --> 48:27.300
It's physical, it's sexual;

48:27.334 --> 48:29.503
whereas a concert pianist,

48:30.873 --> 48:32.607
you perform for a bunch of rich,

48:32.640 --> 48:34.475
old conservative bastards

48:34.509 --> 48:39.182
who take a nap while you're
pouring your heart out.

48:39.215 --> 48:43.620
I could never look out into
the audience because of that.

48:43.653 --> 48:44.554
I hated it.

48:46.856 --> 48:48.559
I felt like a performing monkey.

48:48.592 --> 48:50.061
Performing monkey?

48:50.095 --> 48:51.196
You know what I mean.

48:51.229 --> 48:52.296
Yeah, I do.

48:53.731 --> 48:56.535
To me, touring with a
rock band is a good time.

48:56.568 --> 48:59.272
You have to band, the
roadies, the groupies,

48:59.304 --> 49:00.874
you're never alone.

49:02.142 --> 49:06.013
As a concert pianist,
I hated going on tour.

49:06.046 --> 49:08.049
You're always alone,

49:08.082 --> 49:10.851
alone in your hotel room,

49:10.885 --> 49:14.389
alone on the stage,
alone with your piano,

49:15.490 --> 49:18.227
alone in your head,
it was painful

49:20.163 --> 49:22.364
But then I would hear the music

49:22.398 --> 49:26.103
and all that loneliness
just fades away.

49:26.137 --> 49:29.539
The only time I ever felt that
way is when I was on stage

49:29.573 --> 49:30.408
or at home

49:32.810 --> 49:34.313
with Linda.

49:34.345 --> 49:35.613
Linda?

49:35.646 --> 49:36.648
My fiance.

49:41.787 --> 49:44.357
I loved her more than
anything else in the world.

49:44.390 --> 49:46.826
Have you ever felt like
that about someone?

49:46.860 --> 49:47.694
No.

49:48.897 --> 49:51.333
No, I've, I've never
been lucky in love.

49:51.365 --> 49:54.169
I hope someday you are.

49:54.202 --> 49:56.371
It is the greatest feeling

49:58.373 --> 49:59.942
in the world.

50:03.347 --> 50:04.680
What happened?

50:08.619 --> 50:13.292
I was performing at the Granada
Theater in Santa Barbara.

50:15.760 --> 50:18.764
It was the last of a
long and grueling tour.

50:18.797 --> 50:21.400
All I wanted to do
was finish the piece

50:21.433 --> 50:22.768
and get home to Linda.

50:22.801 --> 50:26.173
Our wedding was
just a week away.

51:12.126 --> 51:12.928
Hello.

51:14.595 --> 51:15.397
Yes.

51:17.366 --> 51:18.200
Yes.

51:23.672 --> 51:24.507
What?

51:37.123 --> 51:37.957
Oh God.

51:40.792 --> 51:41.626
Oh God.

51:42.930 --> 51:43.763
Linda.

51:45.032 --> 51:46.433
Linda.

51:46.467 --> 51:47.301
Linda!

51:50.372 --> 51:52.273
Linda, sweetheart.

51:52.307 --> 51:53.640
What's wrong?

51:53.674 --> 51:54.977
Talk to me.

52:01.550 --> 52:03.020
Linda, look at me.

52:06.391 --> 52:07.858
Look at me, Linda.

52:12.096 --> 52:13.198
Look at me!

52:17.903 --> 52:20.407
Linda, where are you going?

52:20.440 --> 52:21.274
Linda!

52:36.591 --> 52:39.529
That was the last
time I saw Linda.

52:40.829 --> 52:42.366
I'm so sorry.

52:45.035 --> 52:46.437
Is death painful?

52:47.603 --> 52:48.839
No.

52:48.872 --> 52:50.707
I didn't feel a thing.

52:52.676 --> 52:54.547
All I remember is at
the moment of impact

52:54.579 --> 52:59.185
being pulled from my seat
and being held up above.

52:59.218 --> 53:01.221
I looked down to myself.

53:02.456 --> 53:03.722
I was confused,

53:05.724 --> 53:06.693
disoriented,

53:10.431 --> 53:12.033
nothing made any sense.

53:14.303 --> 53:17.940
All I knew was I wanted
to get home to Linda.

53:23.213 --> 53:25.382
So I ran down the highway.

53:29.686 --> 53:31.356
But when I got here,

53:33.325 --> 53:34.926
she couldn't see me

53:40.500 --> 53:43.070
then I realized I was dead.

53:46.672 --> 53:48.675
But I was deeply in love

53:51.678 --> 53:53.515
and I couldn't let go.

53:58.020 --> 53:58.988
So I stayed.

54:02.092 --> 54:03.260
Then I waited.

54:06.129 --> 54:07.632
All these years,

54:08.698 --> 54:11.068
you've been waiting for Linda?

54:18.677 --> 54:20.779
I'll let you
have your privacy.

54:20.812 --> 54:21.914
No, no, it's okay.

54:21.948 --> 54:23.583
It's not that important
of a phone call.

54:23.616 --> 54:24.552
Eddie.

54:32.194 --> 54:33.761
Hey.

54:33.794 --> 54:34.629
Hey.

54:36.064 --> 54:37.832
You look really good.

54:38.900 --> 54:40.503
Thanks.

54:40.536 --> 54:43.373
So why did you
need to talk to me?

54:44.274 --> 54:45.775
I miss you, Lisa.

54:45.808 --> 54:47.544
Ever since we broke up,

54:47.578 --> 54:49.647
I've been going out of my mind.

54:49.681 --> 54:54.320
Shane, please, just
don't do this again, okay?

54:54.353 --> 54:56.088
I love you, Lisa.

54:56.121 --> 54:57.855
Shane, you hurt me.

54:58.923 --> 55:00.826
I don't feel for you right now.

55:00.859 --> 55:05.265
So you can honestly tell
me that everything we had,

55:06.701 --> 55:07.867
that was just in my head?

55:07.901 --> 55:09.803
No, but it doesn't
change anything.

55:09.836 --> 55:11.339
You were unfaithful to me.

55:11.372 --> 55:13.175
I can, I can change.

55:13.208 --> 55:14.009
You can change?

55:14.042 --> 55:15.210
I can change.

55:15.244 --> 55:17.845
Just give me one chance, please.

55:19.781 --> 55:22.151
Where do we start, Shane?

55:22.185 --> 55:23.019
How?

55:25.723 --> 55:27.658
You know, I was thinking
I could move up here

55:27.691 --> 55:28.659
and start looking at places.

55:28.692 --> 55:29.593
No, stop!

55:31.263 --> 55:33.797
I can't, I can't be with you.

55:33.831 --> 55:34.832
Seriously?

55:36.469 --> 55:37.303
Yeah.

55:39.372 --> 55:40.206
Fine.

55:42.908 --> 55:45.279
If you honestly think
that there's no way

55:45.312 --> 55:47.314
for this to work out,
obviously I'm upset.

55:47.347 --> 55:51.586
But you're a big girl,
you can do what you want.

55:51.619 --> 55:52.786
Thank you for understanding.

55:52.819 --> 55:55.157
I didn't say I understood.

55:56.325 --> 55:58.727
I'm just saying I
can't make you love me.

55:58.761 --> 56:01.131
Shane, sometimes things
just don't work out, okay?

56:01.164 --> 56:03.300
That is bullshit,
Lisa, and you know it!

56:03.333 --> 56:04.334
Calm down.

56:05.502 --> 56:06.537
I don't have time
for this right now.

56:06.570 --> 56:08.905
You never had time for me.

56:11.409 --> 56:14.146
Well, live your
sad, little life!

56:15.314 --> 56:16.081
You know what?

56:16.114 --> 56:17.549
You are an asshole.

56:17.582 --> 56:18.751
Don't call me.

56:33.468 --> 56:35.003
Good morning.

56:35.036 --> 56:36.205
How do I look?

56:37.973 --> 56:40.309
You look beautiful.

56:40.343 --> 56:42.145
Would you care
for a cup of tea?

56:42.179 --> 56:45.382
I, I would love
some, but I'm late.

56:53.057 --> 56:55.160
Did you forget something?

56:56.962 --> 56:58.230
Have a good day.

56:58.263 --> 57:00.100
See you later.

57:21.090 --> 57:22.859
Hi, can I help you?

57:22.891 --> 57:24.428
Yes, I'm Lisa Wagner.

57:24.461 --> 57:25.262
We spoke on the phone.

57:25.295 --> 57:27.030
Oh yes, of course.

57:27.064 --> 57:27.865
Please come in.

57:27.897 --> 57:29.032
Thank you.

57:41.347 --> 57:42.816
Come in.

57:42.849 --> 57:43.683
Come in.

57:44.751 --> 57:47.254
I'm almo, I'm almost finished.

57:51.325 --> 57:52.693
I finished the second movement.

57:52.727 --> 57:54.563
Wow, that's great.

57:54.596 --> 57:56.098
I'll play it for you
tonight to celebrate,

57:56.131 --> 57:57.599
unless of course you
have other plans.

57:57.633 --> 57:59.001
No, no, that's perfect.

57:59.034 --> 58:01.304
I can't wait to hear.

58:01.337 --> 58:03.540
Hey, um, come with me.

58:03.573 --> 58:04.874
Come.

58:04.908 --> 58:05.941
I have a surprise for you.

58:05.976 --> 58:07.378
Oh, I love surprises.

58:07.411 --> 58:08.245
Okay.

58:14.553 --> 58:15.787
Ms. Thompson?

58:17.022 --> 58:17.856
Yes.

58:19.725 --> 58:20.560
Eddie!

58:23.964 --> 58:24.798
Eddie!

58:27.367 --> 58:31.406
Ah, dear, maybe we
should forget about this.

58:31.439 --> 58:32.774
No, he's here.

58:33.708 --> 58:34.509
It's okay.

58:34.542 --> 58:36.045
Eddie.

58:36.078 --> 58:37.446
Linda, I swear to you.

58:37.480 --> 58:40.015
Look, I knew this
was a silly idea,

58:40.049 --> 58:42.786
but I, I believe you meant well,

58:42.819 --> 58:46.990
otherwise I wouldn't have
come here in the first place.

58:49.293 --> 58:50.695
Good-bye, dear.

58:53.999 --> 58:55.734
Linda?

59:02.141 --> 59:03.142
Oh my God.

59:07.715 --> 59:10.551
All of these
years, I've waited,

59:14.289 --> 59:17.559
wondering if I would
ever see you again.

59:27.070 --> 59:28.272
Don't be frightened.

59:28.305 --> 59:31.109
I'm not, I'm, I'm
just overwhelmed.

59:43.523 --> 59:46.293
I'm very glad
you came to see me.

59:46.326 --> 59:48.596
Lisa was very persuasive.

59:51.098 --> 59:53.601
Most people would've
thought she was crazy.

59:53.634 --> 59:56.005
I wanted to believe her.

59:56.039 --> 59:57.639
I'm glad you did.

01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:02.445
You haven't changed.

01:00:02.478 --> 01:00:05.481
You look the same
as the day we met.

01:00:08.886 --> 01:00:10.588
For years after the accident,

01:00:10.621 --> 01:00:13.725
I couldn't think of
anything but you,

01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:18.564
and my love for
you kept me going.

01:00:18.598 --> 01:00:21.233
But if I had known you
were here, I, I would have-

01:00:21.267 --> 01:00:23.769
- You would have found a ghost

01:00:24.938 --> 01:00:28.842
not someone you could
have built a life with.

01:00:34.616 --> 01:00:35.783
Are you happy?

01:00:36.785 --> 01:00:38.220
Yes.

01:00:38.253 --> 01:00:40.422
I've had a very good life.

01:00:42.292 --> 01:00:46.963
But I want you to know that
there's no one in this world

01:00:48.399 --> 01:00:52.803
who could ever take your
place or make me forget you.

01:01:02.582 --> 01:01:04.317
Is this it for you?

01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:07.855
I mean, do you
stay here forever?

01:01:07.888 --> 01:01:09.289
No.

01:01:09.323 --> 01:01:11.792
I'm about to move on.

01:01:11.826 --> 01:01:12.727
To where?

01:01:16.065 --> 01:01:18.234
I don't really know.

01:01:18.267 --> 01:01:19.702
So I'm,

01:01:19.735 --> 01:01:21.604
I'm gonna have to start
missing you all over again.

01:01:21.637 --> 01:01:22.471
No.

01:01:26.243 --> 01:01:27.678
Just remember me.

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:47.500
I'm so happy that I
got to see you again.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.077
Goodbye, Linda.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:05.254
Goodbye, Eddie.

01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:43.566
How'd it go with Linda?

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.434
Painful.

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:47.303
I'm sorry.

01:02:47.337 --> 01:02:48.305
I shouldn't have meddled.

01:02:48.339 --> 01:02:51.109
Please don't feel that way.

01:02:51.143 --> 01:02:53.711
It was good to see Linda again,

01:02:56.015 --> 01:02:58.617
at the same time it was painful

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:02.388
to realize a lifetime has past.

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.695
Now I know I've stayed too long.

01:03:11.698 --> 01:03:14.602
I wish I'd met you
a long time ago.

01:03:16.071 --> 01:03:18.841
People come into our lives
when they're supposed to.

01:03:18.874 --> 01:03:20.609
But I'm not people.

01:03:22.311 --> 01:03:23.914
I'm a ghost.

01:03:23.947 --> 01:03:26.650
To me, you're no
different than anyone else.

01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:36.296
Good night.

01:04:08.199 --> 01:04:09.033
Eddie?

01:04:18.044 --> 01:04:18.878
Eddie?

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:34.799
You look beautiful.

01:05:34.832 --> 01:05:36.402
Thank you.

01:05:36.436 --> 01:05:38.037
To your new home.

01:05:38.071 --> 01:05:40.206
I hope that you're happy here.

01:05:57.059 --> 01:05:57.892
Hey.

01:05:59.295 --> 01:06:01.564
Shane, what are
you doing here?

01:06:01.597 --> 01:06:04.201
I know that I'm the last
person that you wanna see,

01:06:04.234 --> 01:06:06.970
but I just wanna apologize
for the other day.

01:06:07.004 --> 01:06:09.039
I was wrong and I'm sorry.

01:06:09.073 --> 01:06:10.241
Look, Shane, I'm busy.

01:06:10.274 --> 01:06:12.144
And you should
have called first.

01:06:12.177 --> 01:06:14.512
I wanted to see you.

01:06:14.545 --> 01:06:16.581
And I brought a
little house for me.

01:06:16.614 --> 01:06:19.018
It really wasn't necessary.

01:06:21.687 --> 01:06:24.524
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

01:06:28.728 --> 01:06:29.563
wow!

01:06:31.732 --> 01:06:33.734
Some place you got here.

01:06:40.876 --> 01:06:42.045
You got plans?

01:06:44.481 --> 01:06:45.681
Please don't do this.

01:06:45.715 --> 01:06:47.618
Do what Lisa?

01:06:47.651 --> 01:06:49.154
Merely commenting on the fact

01:06:49.187 --> 01:06:51.322
that the table is set for two?

01:06:51.356 --> 01:06:55.461
Warm glow on your
face, dressed to kill.

01:06:55.494 --> 01:06:57.363
Just curious who
you're having fun with.

01:06:57.396 --> 01:07:00.866
Frankly, Shane, it's
none of your business.

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.568
Look, I don't wanna
hurt your feelings,

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:04.337
but you just keep
pushing and pushing

01:07:04.371 --> 01:07:07.007
until I can't be nice anymore.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.444
It's over between us.

01:07:09.477 --> 01:07:11.446
I don't love you.

01:07:11.479 --> 01:07:12.381
Just don't.

01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:16.285
I'm sorry.

01:07:29.467 --> 01:07:32.170
You know, they say the
more you love someone,

01:07:32.204 --> 01:07:35.874
the more you hate them
when they break your heart.

01:07:35.907 --> 01:07:39.911
I've never loved anyone
the way that I love you.

01:08:02.771 --> 01:08:03.607
Sorry.

01:08:07.145 --> 01:08:09.080
I promised myself I wouldn't
let that son of a bitch

01:08:09.113 --> 01:08:10.114
get to me.

01:08:10.148 --> 01:08:11.215
Then don't.

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.358
You know, if things
were different,

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:20.527
I think I could fall
in love with you.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.961
Yes, but sadly they aren't.

01:08:26.032 --> 01:08:26.866
No.

01:08:35.009 --> 01:08:35.844
Hmm.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.282
This pasta is delicious.

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:43.019
Do you like to cook?

01:08:43.051 --> 01:08:45.389
No, I prefer room service.

01:08:47.191 --> 01:08:49.160
Just like my father.

01:08:49.194 --> 01:08:51.129
Hmm, was your father a chef?

01:08:51.162 --> 01:08:53.831
Now, he was a musician.

01:08:53.865 --> 01:08:56.335
He played guitar in
a rock and roll band.

01:08:56.368 --> 01:08:57.835
Hmm?

01:08:57.868 --> 01:09:01.474
My father had this dream
of becoming a rock star.

01:09:03.008 --> 01:09:05.745
My mother left us
when I was three.

01:09:05.779 --> 01:09:10.117
I guess she just wanted
a more stable life.

01:09:10.151 --> 01:09:12.720
So my father raised
me on the road.

01:09:12.752 --> 01:09:14.689
Oh, that must have
been rough for you.

01:09:14.721 --> 01:09:15.624
Are you kidding me?

01:09:15.657 --> 01:09:17.660
It was a great childhood.

01:09:24.834 --> 01:09:25.935
What's wrong?

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:29.407
I'm out of cigarettes.

01:09:29.441 --> 01:09:30.375
Oh, here.

01:09:32.077 --> 01:09:33.411
Try one of these

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:42.854
Hmm.

01:09:53.066 --> 01:09:54.169
No.

01:09:54.203 --> 01:09:55.003
No, no, no, no.

01:09:55.036 --> 01:09:56.205
Here, watch me.

01:09:56.238 --> 01:09:58.173
You have to hold it in.

01:10:05.248 --> 01:10:06.083
Okay?

01:10:13.692 --> 01:10:15.527
Yeah, hold it in deep.

01:10:20.899 --> 01:10:23.903
Okay, you can, you
can let it out.

01:10:29.444 --> 01:10:30.278
Hmm.

01:10:31.346 --> 01:10:32.280
Yeah.

01:10:32.314 --> 01:10:33.648
How do you feel?

01:10:34.815 --> 01:10:35.984
I feel nice.

01:10:40.656 --> 01:10:42.659
Hey, save some for me.

01:10:45.995 --> 01:10:46.829
Really?

01:10:57.443 --> 01:11:00.846
Do you hear any new
music in your head?

01:11:02.515 --> 01:11:03.882
No, not lately.

01:11:05.118 --> 01:11:05.919
Why not?

01:11:07.355 --> 01:11:09.657
Mm, dispirited, I suppose.

01:11:13.829 --> 01:11:14.862
Dispirited?

01:11:18.501 --> 01:11:19.335
Yeah.

01:11:20.603 --> 01:11:23.004
I went to a record company,

01:11:24.408 --> 01:11:27.043
they won't listen to my
stuff unless I had an agent.

01:11:27.076 --> 01:11:29.781
And I can get an agent
till they hear me play.

01:11:29.814 --> 01:11:33.218
But I can't get a gig
unless I have a record deal.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.589
That sucks.

01:11:36.622 --> 01:11:37.857
Tell me about it.

01:11:37.889 --> 01:11:40.860
How do you make it
in this business?

01:11:40.892 --> 01:11:43.363
In my time, it was talent;

01:11:43.397 --> 01:11:44.564
today, who knows?

01:11:44.598 --> 01:11:48.369
KKWA
92.7 after midnight.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.008
Oh!

01:11:54.041 --> 01:11:55.778
Oh, I love this song!

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.382
Do you wanna dance with me?

01:11:59.416 --> 01:12:00.350
Oh, come on.

01:12:00.383 --> 01:12:02.285
Come on, dance with me.

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:06.857
I must warn you,
I'm not Fred Astaire.

01:12:15.901 --> 01:12:18.504
Ooh.

01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:43.300
Thank you for
the wonder evening.

01:12:45.335 --> 01:12:46.236
Good night.

01:12:52.376 --> 01:12:53.445
Good night.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.469
What in the hell do
you think you're doing?

01:13:14.503 --> 01:13:16.838
Smoking pot, drinking wine,

01:13:16.872 --> 01:13:18.774
sweet talking that young girl.

01:13:18.808 --> 01:13:20.843
Who do you think you are, Romeo?

01:13:20.877 --> 01:13:22.578
You're dead.

01:13:22.612 --> 01:13:23.514
Dead.

01:13:23.547 --> 01:13:24.348
Angel.

01:13:24.381 --> 01:13:25.282
No!

01:13:25.315 --> 01:13:27.417
I don't wanna hear it, mm-mm.

01:13:27.451 --> 01:13:29.420
This time you've
crossed the line.

01:13:29.454 --> 01:13:32.824
First off, you show
yourself to the lady,

01:13:32.857 --> 01:13:35.427
uh-uh, that ain't
right, that is not done.

01:13:35.461 --> 01:13:37.696
Secondly, who are
you to tell her

01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:41.568
she has to move out
of her own house.

01:13:41.601 --> 01:13:43.937
Louie and I, we've
had it with you.

01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:46.373
We've been doing
this for 75 years

01:13:46.406 --> 01:13:49.977
and we have never had any
problems up until you.

01:13:50.011 --> 01:13:52.613
You're supposed to have
already crossed over,

01:13:52.647 --> 01:13:56.718
so you're upsetting the
natural order of things.

01:13:56.752 --> 01:14:00.156
So now you're
gonna come with us.

01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:02.125
Let's go.

01:14:02.158 --> 01:14:03.326
I'm not ready.

01:14:03.359 --> 01:14:04.594
What, you have
to pack a suitcase?

01:14:04.627 --> 01:14:06.130
Louie!

01:14:06.163 --> 01:14:07.531
Angel!

01:14:07.565 --> 01:14:09.199
What do you want me to do?

01:14:09.233 --> 01:14:11.403
The man's not ready.

01:14:11.436 --> 01:14:12.938
But...

01:14:12.971 --> 01:14:17.176
Louie, sometimes you are as
useless as tits on a bull!

01:14:19.178 --> 01:14:22.348
Eddie, Angel and
I are here to help.

01:14:26.019 --> 01:14:28.655
Tell me how we can help you.

01:14:28.689 --> 01:14:31.159
Let me finish my concerto.

01:14:31.192 --> 01:14:32.293
- Fine.
- But,

01:14:33.428 --> 01:14:35.264
but you're not gonna
change your mind, right?

01:14:35.297 --> 01:14:37.098
You have my word, Angel.

01:14:37.132 --> 01:14:37.933
Good.

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:42.706
When you're
ready, push this button.

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.414
Okay.

01:14:53.652 --> 01:14:55.454
Mama, I can't talk right now.

01:14:57.789 --> 01:14:58.590
Let's go.

01:14:58.624 --> 01:15:00.226
You behave.

01:15:13.441 --> 01:15:15.276
He looks real, Tiff.

01:15:16.277 --> 01:15:17.113
He's real.

01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:24.021
We're talking about a
ghost for Christ sakes!

01:15:24.054 --> 01:15:26.723
I know it sounds crazy,
but I feel for him.

01:15:26.757 --> 01:15:29.260
Look, you're my only friend.

01:15:30.595 --> 01:15:32.330
Don't go crazy on me.

01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:57.225
I didn't hear you come in.

01:15:57.259 --> 01:15:58.393
How long have you been back?

01:15:58.427 --> 01:15:59.262
A bit.

01:16:01.364 --> 01:16:03.199
I brought you some cigarettes.

01:16:03.232 --> 01:16:04.233
Thank you.

01:16:11.576 --> 01:16:13.145
What's wrong?

01:16:13.179 --> 01:16:14.579
What makes you think
something is wrong?

01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:15.680
I can tell.

01:16:16.681 --> 01:16:17.516
Can you?

01:16:19.685 --> 01:16:20.519
Yeah.

01:16:21.821 --> 01:16:23.557
You can talk to me.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:29.897
Do you remember the other
night when you asked me

01:16:29.931 --> 01:16:33.334
if I had ever been in
love and I said no?

01:16:34.602 --> 01:16:35.437
Yes.

01:16:37.173 --> 01:16:38.006
I lied.

01:16:38.841 --> 01:16:40.142
Please don't say that.

01:16:40.176 --> 01:16:41.511
Can't help it.

01:16:42.579 --> 01:16:45.081
I've never felt like this.

01:16:45.115 --> 01:16:47.219
Lisa, I am an illusion.

01:16:50.387 --> 01:16:51.223
I'm dead.

01:16:52.423 --> 01:16:55.694
And my death is a
matter of record.

01:16:55.727 --> 01:16:57.028
We can't just fall in love

01:16:57.062 --> 01:16:59.398
and live happily ever after.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.569
Perhaps if things
were different.

01:17:03.603 --> 01:17:05.506
I'll take my chances.

01:18:14.419 --> 01:18:15.486
How was it?

01:18:18.858 --> 01:18:19.859
Wonderful.

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:39.848
Wow, that's petty.

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:40.716
Don't.

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:45.289
If you press that
button, they'll come.

01:18:45.322 --> 01:18:46.856
Who?

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:48.559
The soul collectors.

01:18:48.592 --> 01:18:50.527
The soul collectors?

01:18:50.561 --> 01:18:54.132
When a person dies
their could is confused,

01:18:54.165 --> 01:18:56.501
it doesn't know where to go.

01:18:57.936 --> 01:19:01.741
The soul collectors guide
them and help them move on.

01:19:04.378 --> 01:19:07.514
You see, time is a human notion.

01:19:07.547 --> 01:19:10.484
There is no time in eternity.

01:19:13.621 --> 01:19:18.560
If you were to press that
button, time would have stopped.

01:19:19.695 --> 01:19:22.097
And when time stops,
eternity begins.

01:19:23.267 --> 01:19:25.568
Does everyone
have one of these?

01:19:25.602 --> 01:19:26.436
No.

01:19:28.672 --> 01:19:32.677
I'm what you might
call a special case.

01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:34.246
The collectors can't
force a soul to move on

01:19:34.279 --> 01:19:36.182
if it doesn't want to.

01:19:40.219 --> 01:19:42.222
But I gave them my word;

01:19:44.457 --> 01:19:48.796
after I finished my concerto,
I would let them know.

01:19:52.968 --> 01:19:55.103
And you would move on?

01:19:55.136 --> 01:19:55.971
Yes.

01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:02.545
Why did you stop me?

01:20:06.683 --> 01:20:08.453
Because I love you.

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.489
I love you too.

01:20:30.345 --> 01:20:31.380
Wait here.

01:20:31.413 --> 01:20:32.481
I'll be back.

01:20:43.693 --> 01:20:47.031
And, um, I think I'll
take this with me,

01:20:48.266 --> 01:20:49.133
just in case.

01:21:04.317 --> 01:21:07.355
You never moaned
like that with me.

01:21:08.722 --> 01:21:10.491
Shane, you scared
the hell out of me.

01:21:10.525 --> 01:21:11.893
What are you doing here?

01:21:11.926 --> 01:21:13.795
I'm here because I love you.

01:21:13.828 --> 01:21:16.432
Shane, I think that
you should leave.

01:21:16.465 --> 01:21:19.001
I don't think I can.

01:21:19.034 --> 01:21:20.537
Yeah, that's it.

01:21:21.438 --> 01:21:23.441
I'm calling the police.

01:21:23.474 --> 01:21:25.409
I wouldn't do that.

01:21:28.111 --> 01:21:31.550
Shane, this, this is
getting out of hand.

01:21:36.489 --> 01:21:37.923
You were the best
thing in my life, Lisa,

01:21:37.956 --> 01:21:40.226
and I let you get away.

01:21:40.259 --> 01:21:42.095
I, I'm to blame.

01:21:42.128 --> 01:21:45.064
I have no right to be mad at you

01:21:45.098 --> 01:21:48.369
for hooking up with the
first guy that you meet.

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:49.237
But I am.

01:21:51.972 --> 01:21:54.776
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:56.077
Come back to me.

01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:57.279
Shane!

01:21:57.313 --> 01:22:00.616
I swear to you, Lisa,
if I can't have you,

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.220
I don't wanna go on living.

01:22:03.253 --> 01:22:04.753
Look, this, this isn't you.

01:22:04.788 --> 01:22:06.022
You don't wanna do this.

01:22:06.056 --> 01:22:09.092
Since when do you
care what I want?

01:22:09.126 --> 01:22:10.627
If you really cared,

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.565
we wouldn't even be having
this conversation, would we?

01:22:13.599 --> 01:22:14.899
It's because you don't care,

01:22:14.932 --> 01:22:17.736
that's why we're
in this situation!

01:22:19.439 --> 01:22:21.407
I love you, Lisa.

01:22:21.441 --> 01:22:22.275
Do you?

01:22:24.911 --> 01:22:26.380
Do you really love her?

01:22:26.413 --> 01:22:28.148
If I didn't, then
why would I be here?

01:22:28.181 --> 01:22:29.850
Then why are you
pointing the gun at her?

01:22:29.884 --> 01:22:31.319
Does this make
more sense to you?

01:22:31.353 --> 01:22:32.820
I hate guns.

01:22:32.853 --> 01:22:34.322
Why don't you put
that thing away?

01:22:34.356 --> 01:22:36.091
Are you asking me
or are you telling me?

01:22:36.124 --> 01:22:37.859
I'm asking, please.

01:22:40.763 --> 01:22:43.900
I gotta give it to
you, you sure are polite.

01:22:43.933 --> 01:22:45.369
Why don't you
just give me the gun

01:22:45.402 --> 01:22:46.637
and we'll forget this
whole thing ever happened?

01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:47.605
Back off!

01:22:47.639 --> 01:22:48.906
Give me the gun.

01:22:51.442 --> 01:22:52.844
Give me the gun.

01:22:52.877 --> 01:22:54.045
Stop!

01:22:54.078 --> 01:22:55.046
Don't mess with me!

01:22:55.079 --> 01:22:55.880
I mean it!

01:22:58.082 --> 01:22:59.185
Shane, stop!

01:23:16.305 --> 01:23:17.139
Why?

01:23:18.274 --> 01:23:20.243
Because I love you.

01:23:20.276 --> 01:23:22.445
I couldn't bear to
see you get hurt.

01:23:22.478 --> 01:23:24.180
I'm a ghost,

01:23:24.214 --> 01:23:26.617
the bullet would have
gone straight through me.

01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:29.019
So what happens now?

01:23:33.658 --> 01:23:35.294
Evening, Ms. Wagner.

01:23:35.328 --> 01:23:36.596
Angel, Louie,

01:23:41.335 --> 01:23:43.970
you're the soul collectors.

01:23:44.003 --> 01:23:45.672
I'm so sorry, I...

01:23:47.508 --> 01:23:50.177
Could we please have a minute.

01:23:51.078 --> 01:23:52.347
You got five.

01:23:58.219 --> 01:24:00.290
I don't want you to go.

01:24:01.258 --> 01:24:03.260
It'll be for the best.

01:24:04.327 --> 01:24:05.496
When will I see you again?

01:24:05.529 --> 01:24:07.498
I don't know.

01:24:07.531 --> 01:24:11.969
But I promise you, wherever
you are, I will find you.

01:24:14.205 --> 01:24:16.073
How will you find me?

01:24:16.908 --> 01:24:18.143
I don't know,

01:24:20.212 --> 01:24:21.113
but I will.

01:24:28.255 --> 01:24:29.691
Goodbye.

01:24:29.724 --> 01:24:33.528
Please, just hold me
a little bit longer.

01:24:38.867 --> 01:24:40.135
Time!

01:24:45.875 --> 01:24:48.246
Till we meet again.

01:24:48.279 --> 01:24:50.581
Goodbye, my love.

01:26:19.577 --> 01:26:20.757
Dear Lisa,

01:26:20.841 --> 01:26:22.409
the few moments
we shared together

01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:24.295
are more than enough
to fill my heart,

01:26:24.414 --> 01:26:25.916
until we meet again.

01:26:26.528 --> 01:26:28.895
All my love, Eddie.
