00:01.080 --> 00:03.430
My son Jason turned 14 today.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.510
His father is Kevin Russell.

00:05.560 --> 00:08.550
Kevin has been in prison
for all of Jason's life.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.600
- Did you murder Linda Simms?
- No, I did not.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.470
You hit Linda with a shovel.
What part of her body?

00:14.520 --> 00:16.309
She's showing Kevin what to say...

00:16.360 --> 00:18.560
- Her head.
- .. pointing to the answers.

00:20.720 --> 00:24.190
She was first buried on...
Or near... an air force base.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.360
And then she was moved. Why?

00:27.040 --> 00:30.960
It is our majority opinion that the
conviction of Mr Russell is unsafe.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.390
You've seen what's been
happening over here?

00:34.440 --> 00:37.680
Don't worry about Russell.
I used the photographs.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.630
- Why did you stop me?
- It's the company you keep.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.510
What do you mean, the company I keep?

00:44.560 --> 00:47.190
Your uncle Yusef is not
making life easy for me.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.070
Or for his wife.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.990
I was thrown out of my flat. I
am forbidden to go to my husband.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.830
Look, they suspect anyone
with ties to Syria, that's all.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.630
You let a terrorist's
wife live in your home,

00:57.680 --> 00:59.510
and you set a murderer free.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.320
You play with fire.

Spin the camera!

Spin the camera!

01:51.920 --> 01:54.350
Kevin Russell, guilty, guilty, guilty!

02:34.720 --> 02:36.870
That was me,

02:36.920 --> 02:39.000
when I was young.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.760
How could I let you go?

02:57.240 --> 02:59.240
Look, there's Mummy.

03:10.160 --> 03:14.350
One of the staff must have
recognised Kevin, called the press.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.510
- Or called them, Linda's dad and uncle.
- Unbelievable!

03:17.560 --> 03:19.350
Why aren't the police doing anything?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.350
You kidding? They're loving it.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.960
Hi, Annie. Kevin.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.430
- How are you doing?
- Doing?

03:31.480 --> 03:33.510
I wish I was back inside.

03:38.240 --> 03:41.030
- You have to move.
- But we've paid for the room.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.390
Yeah, in the name of David Martin.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.340
If I'd known it was him, I'd never
have let him in. You have to go.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.360
Please.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.240
Before that lot does any serious damage.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.190
But where can I go?

04:05.440 --> 04:09.350
Kevin Russell, guilty, guilty, guilty!

04:12.440 --> 04:14.280
OK.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.829
- Kevin, this is Dominic.
- There he is!

04:17.880 --> 04:19.790
Get in! Get in! Come on! Get in!

04:19.839 --> 04:22.670
Kevin, get in the car! Get
in, quick. Lock the door!

04:22.720 --> 04:24.430
You're a murderer!

04:24.480 --> 04:26.710
Dom! Dom, get going!

04:26.760 --> 04:28.130
Get him out of the car!

04:28.880 --> 04:33.030
- I can't bloody go!
- We're coming, Russell!

04:33.080 --> 04:34.910
Emma, don't!

04:34.960 --> 04:37.990
You get the fuck away from him!

04:38.040 --> 04:41.030
- Get away!
- Get out of the way, you stupid cow!

04:41.080 --> 04:43.120
- Agh!
- Get in, get in!

04:44.120 --> 04:46.880
Dom! Let's go.

04:49.440 --> 04:52.390
- OK, go!
- Open it! Open it right now!

04:52.440 --> 04:55.270
What is this?

04:55.320 --> 04:58.270
What are you doing here?

04:58.320 --> 05:00.710
What is this bloody shambles?

05:00.760 --> 05:02.760
Are we Chelsea fans?

05:04.040 --> 05:06.150
Is this who we are?

05:06.200 --> 05:09.710
I see people I know, people
I'm surprised to see here.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.950
Look, I understand that you're angry.
Too right.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.160
I'm angry too.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.390
But this isn't how we express ourselves!

05:18.440 --> 05:20.910
- Who is this guy?
- It's Matthew Wild, the local MP.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.430
Not scaring decent
people, damaging property.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.310
Thank Christ he turned up.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.870
Let that man leave unharmed.

05:26.920 --> 05:31.030
And the police have promised me that
no one here will be charged tonight.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.750
No one.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.710
Come on now, it's late.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.760
Let's go home.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.670
Charlie, leave it. Let's go home. Phil...

05:43.720 --> 05:45.720
You OK?

05:49.280 --> 05:53.240
Phil, we'll talk. Come on.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.600
- Thank you, Mr Wild.
- No problem. Good night.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.750
'The leadership contest is heating up.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.070
'Cromarty's still ahead in the polls,

06:08.120 --> 06:10.710
but outsider Matthew Wild
is eating into his lead.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.430
From what I'm seeing on Twitter,

06:12.480 --> 06:14.390
Wild enhanced his Action Man image...'

06:14.440 --> 06:17.750
- Hi.
- Were you the hero?

06:17.800 --> 06:21.990
Yep. I told them all to jolly well
behave themselves and go home to bed.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.080
And, um, they did.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.800
Thanks.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.590
What are you going to say to him?

06:39.640 --> 06:42.350
I don't know. I might
just knock his head off.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.070
Annie, he's...

06:44.120 --> 06:46.070
Part of a mob.

06:46.120 --> 06:49.670
Attacking his own father.
Don't try to defend him.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.430
- Where've you been?
- Nowhere.

06:56.480 --> 07:00.830
Jason, I saw you!

07:00.880 --> 07:03.070
Then why did you ask?

07:03.120 --> 07:05.000
But how could you?

07:10.720 --> 07:12.720
Jason!

07:41.480 --> 07:43.430
Who's the bloke?

07:43.480 --> 07:45.550
Dominic Truelove, an excopper.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.550
Are they er...?

07:48.600 --> 07:50.190
Unlikely.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.240
He's gay.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.390
The balls on that woman.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.150
Seems pretty dedicated.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.110
To her giant ego.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.110
Is SO15 watching the house?

08:04.160 --> 08:07.310
Yeah, Banville's got Yousef
Attar's wife holed up in there.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.190
Why don't you pull her in?

08:09.240 --> 08:12.590
No grounds. I need more help from GCHQ.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.470
This is your case now, so watch her.

08:15.520 --> 08:19.510
Russell's lawyer at trial
was a joke. Banville's not.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.880
She'll spot any mistake, and
make the whole case turn on it.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.440
There's a sleeping bag and a pillow.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.390
Jesus!

08:41.440 --> 08:45.390
Kevin, this is Steve, my boyfriend.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.150
- Steve, this is...
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.200
Peace, mate.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.760
Well, now you know where the bathroom is.

09:01.360 --> 09:05.430
Kevin, I've heard from the police
that there are photos of Linda,

09:05.480 --> 09:07.710
nude photos,

09:07.760 --> 09:09.510
and that you know about them.

09:09.560 --> 09:13.680
No. It's the police lying again, innit?

09:14.840 --> 09:16.840
They're bloody desperate.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.790
Emma, who is that man?

09:23.840 --> 09:25.840
Er, Kevin Russell.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.280
He'll be staying here for a while.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.280
Kevin Russell, the murderer?

09:35.040 --> 09:36.960
No.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.990
Kevin's innocent.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.000
That's why they let him out of prison.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.390
So you got him out.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.440
Well done, you.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.910
Miriam, who were you meeting
outside, earlier this evening?

09:55.960 --> 09:58.510
My cousin.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.680
He brought me some clothes for Karim.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.590
- Is that OK?
- Yeah, it's OK.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.590
Just be careful.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.310
I told you the police are
probably watching the house.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.790
If they catch you
communicating with Yusef...

10:11.840 --> 10:13.630
I don't know where he is!

10:13.680 --> 10:15.550
Or any of his associates,

10:15.600 --> 10:19.030
they could charge you with failure
to disclose relevant information

10:19.080 --> 10:22.480
and they could arrest you,
Miriam, and you could lose Karim.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.270
Just be careful.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.310
I will.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.360
I won't let them take Karim.

11:14.360 --> 11:18.430
So these are the interviews
with the man who took the photos.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.830
So the police just gave these to us?

11:21.880 --> 11:24.190
Without a fight?

11:24.240 --> 11:26.070
Yep. The new guy running the case.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.120
Do you think he's playing games?

11:30.240 --> 11:37.150
'DCI Nick Staines, Islington Police
Station, 22nd of April 2017, 8:35am.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.630
With me are Tony Pullings...'

11:38.680 --> 11:41.310
The weasel journalist, the
one taking pictures of us.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.470
'.. Janice Long of
Murray Jones Solicitors.'

11:43.520 --> 11:46.590
'I want it on record that my client
has come forward of his own accord

11:46.640 --> 11:50.520
to assist the police, despite
the legal risk to himself.'

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
'So, Mr Pullings.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.760
Tony.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.510
When did you approach Linda Simms?'

12:04.560 --> 12:06.560
'I didn't.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.830
She approached me.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.070
She called me. She said she
wanted some glamour shots.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.270
She wanted to be a Page Three girl.'

12:16.320 --> 12:18.830
'She was 15. That's suborning a minor.'

12:18.880 --> 12:22.030
'My client had no idea Linda was 15.'

12:22.080 --> 12:24.790
'Look, I know I should've checked.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.360
And that's why I kept quiet about
it for so long. I felt guilty.'

12:31.040 --> 12:33.390
'So a 15yearold schoolgirl comes to you,

12:33.440 --> 12:35.310
and she says she wants some porn pics.'

12:35.360 --> 12:37.030
'It's not porn. That's glamour.'

12:37.080 --> 12:39.270
'So you make her undress
in the middle of winter,

12:39.320 --> 12:42.590
then you take her into the school
and you make her undress some more.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.110
- Did you have sex with her?'
- 'No!'

12:45.160 --> 12:47.430
'How did you get into the school?'

12:47.480 --> 12:49.480
'The caretaker gave me the key.'

12:50.840 --> 12:52.680
'The caretaker?'

12:54.600 --> 12:56.670
'Yeah, Kevin Russell.'

12:56.720 --> 12:58.790
'He just gave it to you?'

12:58.840 --> 13:00.550
'No, I paid him.'

13:00.600 --> 13:02.630
'Paid him what?'

13:02.680 --> 13:04.630
'Ten quid.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.680
And a set of Linda's photos.'

13:07.840 --> 13:12.360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:29.300 --> 13:34.890
Ms Banville? I'm Nick Staines. I hear you have some
questions about Tony Pullings. We can speak in my office.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.610
Have you charged him with
sexual offences against a minor

13:37.660 --> 13:40.290
or did you make a deal with him
so he could slide out of that?

13:40.340 --> 13:42.810
Has he photographed any
other underage girls?

13:42.860 --> 13:45.970
And is he being interviewed as a
suspect in the Linda Simms murder?

13:46.020 --> 13:48.020
Because he should be.

13:48.700 --> 13:52.770
OK. He was questioned in
2003. Alibi was sound.

13:52.820 --> 13:56.490
His case is being sent to the Crown
Prosecution Service. We've done no deal.

13:56.540 --> 14:01.690
We've agreed to limit our questions to the Linda
Simms inquiry in exchange for his cooperation.

14:01.740 --> 14:05.410
What about the coincidence of the little
shit crawling out of the woodwork now?

14:05.460 --> 14:08.650
No coincidence. He saw a
miscarriage of justice,

14:08.700 --> 14:10.570
felt it was his duty to report it.

14:10.620 --> 14:13.610
Don't make me laugh.
Something's going on here.

14:13.660 --> 14:16.210
- I'm being fucked in the arse.
- Well, not by me.

14:16.260 --> 14:17.930
Perhaps by your client.

14:17.980 --> 14:21.970
Did he tell you Pullings gave
him pornographic photographs?

14:22.020 --> 14:24.300
Pullings saying something is no proof.

14:28.460 --> 14:31.570
DCS Greenwood, when she
searched Kevin's house,

14:31.620 --> 14:33.620
found burned photographs.

14:35.260 --> 14:37.610
The images couldn't be
reconstituted at the time,

14:37.660 --> 14:39.780
but technology's moved on, hasn't it?

14:40.740 --> 14:43.690
In other words, still no proof.

14:43.740 --> 14:45.570
I'm applying for an exhumation order.

14:45.620 --> 14:47.290
What, for Linda?

14:47.340 --> 14:50.010
But you got the autopsy
report, the forensics.

14:50.060 --> 14:52.890
I'm having all forensics
reexamined by an independent lab,

14:52.940 --> 14:55.010
not one that's owned by expolicemen.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.700
I want that body.

15:13.820 --> 15:16.570
Heather. You look well.

15:16.620 --> 15:19.380
What a happy marriage does for a girl.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.050
Emma Banville. What do you have?

15:23.100 --> 15:25.580
Well, more than I expected.

15:26.220 --> 15:31.570
She's been a person of interest
for MI5 and 6 for years.

15:31.620 --> 15:37.290
Started here, Cambridge. Student
radical, protesting everything

15:37.340 --> 15:40.730
from American nukes to
council house sales.

15:40.780 --> 15:43.730
Even got herself arrested a few times.

15:43.780 --> 15:45.330
How did it start? Her family?

15:45.380 --> 15:47.410
No, they're good people.

15:47.460 --> 15:51.490
Looks like someone got to
her when she arrived here.

15:51.540 --> 15:55.330
Are 5 and 6 looking at her now?

15:55.380 --> 15:59.530
More SO15, Counter Terrorism Command,

15:59.580 --> 16:06.170
in the person, ironically, of
their number two, Olivia Greenwood.

16:06.220 --> 16:09.010
That is ironic. What's the case?

16:09.060 --> 16:14.570
Banville represents a British
doctor of Syrian descent,

16:14.620 --> 16:17.980
Yusef Attar, suspected
of working for ISIS.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.780
Excellent. Thank you.

16:25.340 --> 16:27.540
What's this got to do with Russell?

16:29.900 --> 16:31.690
Really?

16:31.740 --> 16:35.410
I thought they made you Master
of Beaumont, or whatever you are,

16:35.460 --> 16:37.460
because of your brilliant mind.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.410
Hi, this is Mary. Is John there?

16:59.940 --> 17:02.940
Hi, can you put me through
to our liaison at Fort Meade?

17:04.300 --> 17:06.819
I need a target profile on a UK national.

17:14.140 --> 17:15.859
Em?

17:18.940 --> 17:21.060
Why are you so sad?

17:23.980 --> 17:26.740
No, it's work. It's going badly.

17:31.140 --> 17:33.140
But it's more you.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.420
I don't want to lose you.

17:44.260 --> 17:46.260
I'm so proud of you.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.420
So proud.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.090
Hello, Delilah. It's Emma.

18:30.140 --> 18:33.250
'Look, something's come up, though
hardly in happy circumstances.'

18:33.300 --> 18:34.970
What do you mean?

18:35.020 --> 18:39.690
A car crash, mother killed, but
the child survived, unharmed.

18:39.740 --> 18:42.810
- God. How old?
- 'He's five.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.410
The mother's a single parent.'

18:44.460 --> 18:48.730
It's fostering, not adopting, while
we try to trace the mother's family.

18:48.780 --> 18:52.490
The answer's yes, yes, of course.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.650
'We'll have to see if you and the boy...'

18:54.700 --> 18:57.090
- Get on, bond.
- 'Talk to Steve.'

18:57.140 --> 18:59.530
I'll try and set up a
meeting as soon as possible.

18:59.580 --> 19:01.580
Thank you.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.290
So what Tony Pullings is
saying is that he paid you

19:12.340 --> 19:15.650
to get into the school to shoot these,

19:15.700 --> 19:18.570
And then he gave you copies of them.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.890
No.

19:20.940 --> 19:23.050
I've never seen them before.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.850
The police are also saying they
found burnt photos in your flat

19:25.900 --> 19:27.730
from 2003.

19:27.780 --> 19:29.930
Well, burnt photos of what?

19:29.980 --> 19:34.100
They don't know, but
they're looking into it.

19:35.820 --> 19:39.180
So if you've got anything to
tell me, Kevin, now's the time.

19:46.460 --> 19:48.570
- He had the photos.
- Shut up, Annie.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.530
I found 'em. I burned 'em. I'm not sorry.

19:51.580 --> 19:53.570
She was a little slut.

19:53.620 --> 19:57.610
Look at her. She's ready to
do that, why not the other?

19:57.660 --> 19:59.540
But with who?

20:01.060 --> 20:03.970
Annie, if you know anything
about Linda, you must tell me.

20:04.020 --> 20:06.090
Because these photos, they hurt Kevin.

20:06.140 --> 20:09.700
What's wrong with having photos?
It don't mean I touched her.

20:10.860 --> 20:12.900
God, you are so bloody thick.

20:14.340 --> 20:16.650
I can't do this any more. I'm sorry.

20:16.700 --> 20:19.290
I've got two kids of my own, not just his.

20:19.340 --> 20:21.930
Even Derek's saying enough is enough.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.860
- I'm sorry.
- Annie!

20:29.940 --> 20:33.570
Cops manage to recover images from
those burnt pics, you're toast.

20:33.620 --> 20:36.930
Prosecution gets either of them
on the stand, you're toast.

20:36.980 --> 20:39.420
I hope we're not bloody
wrong about him, Em.

20:42.660 --> 20:44.570
- What's that?
- Tits.

20:44.620 --> 20:47.810
- No, that!
- Looks like a plane.

20:47.860 --> 20:50.370
Yeah, but it's not just
a plane, it's an F16.

20:50.420 --> 20:51.850
It's a US Air Force fighter.

20:51.900 --> 20:55.810
Why do you stick that on your bra?
She sending a message to someone?

20:55.860 --> 20:57.650
Maybe it's just a piece of jewellery.

20:57.700 --> 21:00.020
Since when do you wear jewellery on a bra?

21:19.020 --> 21:21.810
I know these photographs are upsetting,

21:21.860 --> 21:24.620
but I must ask you to look at them.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.170
It's important for Linda,
not just for my client.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.300
We all need to know the truth.

21:33.700 --> 21:35.740
You two again?

22:02.900 --> 22:07.140
- Would you look at this one?
- So you carry these round?

22:07.860 --> 22:10.050
You show my kid round
like she's a piece of meat.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.610
No. These photos remain private.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.980
That's the agreement
we made with the police.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.380
Please.

22:20.740 --> 22:24.330
This is a tie pin of an F16.
It's an American fighter.

22:24.380 --> 22:28.330
Now, there was an American
squadron based here at Crawbury,

22:28.380 --> 22:30.380
at the time when Linda...

22:32.180 --> 22:35.010
Do you think it's possible that
she knew anyone at the base?

22:35.060 --> 22:38.530
A pilot? A mechanic? Because
the photo's very intimate.

22:38.580 --> 22:40.890
And the fact that she put
a tie pin on her bra...

22:40.940 --> 22:46.500
You're asking if my 15yearold
daughter was sleeping with a Yank?

22:48.460 --> 22:50.930
I'm asking if she knew someone

22:50.980 --> 22:53.620
who could have given her
a tie pin as a memento.

22:54.300 --> 22:58.250
So all that stuff, what
you're saying, I got that

22:58.300 --> 23:00.290
because I got screwed too?

23:00.340 --> 23:02.450
Or maybe my wife.

23:02.500 --> 23:05.290
So you don't know of any relationship...

23:05.340 --> 23:07.330
She was 15!

23:07.380 --> 23:10.730
She grew up surrounded by
this stuff. It means nothing.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.530
No, I'm sorry, it does mean something.

23:12.580 --> 23:15.890
This photo proves there was at least
one other predator in Linda's life.

23:15.940 --> 23:19.570
The man who took this, Tony
Pullings, did she ever mention him?

23:19.620 --> 23:20.930
No.

23:20.980 --> 23:24.610
Are you sure? Because he was the man
taking photos of us at the school.

23:24.660 --> 23:26.530
- She didn't mention him?
- No.

23:26.580 --> 23:30.050
Did she ever mention anyone pestering her?

23:30.100 --> 23:32.290
Yeah. Kevin Russell.

23:32.340 --> 23:34.810
The man who murdered her.

23:34.860 --> 23:36.620
Are you done?

23:43.180 --> 23:45.260
There's one more thing I need to ask.

23:46.700 --> 23:50.330
And that's permission
to exhume Linda's body.

23:55.820 --> 23:58.850
Now, if you were brave enough
to give me this permission,

23:58.900 --> 24:01.170
I wouldn't have to go through the courts.

24:01.220 --> 24:04.540
You'd avoid all the publicity
that it would involve.

24:06.580 --> 24:10.570
It's important. We all need to
know what happened with Linda.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.380
It might give you closure.

24:13.500 --> 24:16.700
So, what do you say?

24:18.580 --> 24:20.730
Get off her! Get off her!

24:20.780 --> 24:22.780
Beth!

24:35.420 --> 24:38.020
I suppose you're gonna
say it serves me right.

24:39.340 --> 24:41.340
Serves you right.

24:47.780 --> 24:50.380
She was killed somewhere near here.

24:52.100 --> 24:54.100
Buried alive.

24:55.500 --> 24:57.610
Here.

24:57.660 --> 25:01.250
The family know more than
they're saying. They must.

25:01.300 --> 25:04.770
A teenager sticks something on her
bra... doesn't have to mean anything.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.940
Yeah, but it could mean everything.

25:08.060 --> 25:11.810
It was February 2003, and
the Americans were here.

25:11.860 --> 25:14.620
They were going to war.
We were all going to war.

25:25.700 --> 25:28.290
Olivia Greenwood? Heather Myles.

25:28.340 --> 25:30.570
I've heard so many great things about you.

25:30.620 --> 25:34.690
I was just talking to my boys,
very confused by time zones.

25:34.740 --> 25:37.690
That's Josh, that's Isaac.

25:37.740 --> 25:41.210
- I don't care.
- OK.

25:41.260 --> 25:43.290
I was asked to meet you. Here I am.

25:43.340 --> 25:45.650
So, what do you want?

25:45.700 --> 25:47.610
Emma Banville.

25:47.660 --> 25:49.850
What about Banville?

25:49.900 --> 25:53.050
- She's getting in the way.
- In whose way? In what context?

25:53.100 --> 25:56.860
Yusef Attar, Miriam Attar.

25:58.820 --> 26:01.370
My colleagues wanna talk
to Miriam, but they can't.

26:01.420 --> 26:03.770
I understand you can't either.

26:03.820 --> 26:05.940
What's that got to do with you?

26:07.220 --> 26:10.130
I can help you get to Miriam.

26:10.180 --> 26:13.370
I can access communications you can't.

26:13.420 --> 26:15.250
Like what?

26:15.300 --> 26:17.210
For one, I can get you international.

26:17.260 --> 26:21.770
For two, I bet you only see
metadata. I can get you content.

26:21.820 --> 26:25.730
You'll have our ears over the Middle East.

26:25.780 --> 26:28.410
That'll give you cause to move on Miriam,

26:28.460 --> 26:31.540
and there's nothing
Banville can do about it.

26:36.820 --> 26:39.210
Banville knows the rules.

26:39.260 --> 26:41.300
She plays by the rules.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.570
Now, you try a short cut,

26:44.620 --> 26:47.500
she'll sniff it out and
make you rue the day.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.580
So, no.

26:52.020 --> 26:54.020
No, thanks.

27:43.700 --> 27:45.650
Emma!

27:45.700 --> 27:47.650
I am so sorry, Zeinab.

27:47.700 --> 27:50.610
- No, really.
- You managed to miss the whole thing.

27:50.660 --> 27:54.650
Look, I would have been cross,
but we found a replacement.

27:54.700 --> 27:57.090
Matthew Wild turned up.

27:57.140 --> 27:59.410
Made a splendid speech, off the cuff.

27:59.460 --> 28:03.020
It's true what they're saying...
He could be the next Prime Minister.

28:05.460 --> 28:07.660
Could you introduce me to him, Zei?

28:13.100 --> 28:16.450
Matthew, meet my dear
friend Emma Banville.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.690
The lady who's late for her own party.

28:18.740 --> 28:22.450
Hi, thank you so much for covering.
I'm sorry I missed your speech.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.210
I'm sorry I missed yours.

28:24.260 --> 28:27.340
- Could I borrow you just for a moment?
- Yeah, of course.

28:30.620 --> 28:32.620
Wow. She really did hit you.

28:33.580 --> 28:36.450
Yeah, that's, er, that's
actually why I'm here.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.730
You see, Charlie Simms called.

28:38.780 --> 28:41.730
He's worried you'll press
charges. But you won't, will you?

28:41.780 --> 28:43.690
- No.
- No.

28:43.740 --> 28:47.210
Because that would hurt your case
more than you're hurting it already.

28:47.260 --> 28:51.210
What you're putting that family
through, it beggars belief.

28:51.260 --> 28:53.930
Sorry, I didn't know you knew them.

28:53.980 --> 28:55.930
Well, they're my constituents.

28:55.980 --> 28:57.730
Charlie Simms was a union organiser.

28:57.780 --> 28:59.810
I'd never have got elected without him.

28:59.860 --> 29:02.860
So... what's up?

29:04.420 --> 29:07.290
I believe that the wrong
man, Kevin Russell,

29:07.340 --> 29:09.730
who's also one of your constituents,

29:09.780 --> 29:12.300
was convicted for Linda's murder.

29:13.140 --> 29:16.930
I was hoping that you could
persuade Linda's family

29:16.980 --> 29:20.900
that exhuming Linda would be the
quickest way of finding the truth.

29:22.780 --> 29:24.450
The truth?

29:24.500 --> 29:26.970
Yes, that Kevin didn't do it,

29:27.020 --> 29:29.500
and that the real killer
is still out there.

29:32.660 --> 29:35.170
You know, I can see that you
might have a faint chance

29:35.220 --> 29:37.650
of getting a court to grant
you an exhumation order,

29:37.700 --> 29:39.250
but not with my help.

29:39.300 --> 29:43.250
Forget that I could never look
Beth or Charlie in the eye again,

29:43.300 --> 29:47.740
I actually think it's wrong, and
shame on you for even thinking it.

30:08.660 --> 30:11.580
Whoo! Hey!

30:15.820 --> 30:17.970
Kevin was just playing with Karim.

30:18.020 --> 30:20.610
So I see.

30:20.660 --> 30:22.660
They have so much fun.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.610
It's probably his bedtime anyway.

30:25.660 --> 30:27.540
Yes.

30:30.060 --> 30:31.900
Thank you, Kevin.

30:37.820 --> 30:39.570
What happened to your face?

30:39.620 --> 30:41.210
Beth Simms punched me.

30:44.700 --> 30:47.330
Sorry. Why were you talking to her?

30:47.380 --> 30:50.140
Because I'm trying to keep
you out of prison, Kevin.

30:53.660 --> 30:56.020
I didn't do it, you know?

30:57.780 --> 30:59.650
Yeah.

30:59.700 --> 31:02.660
But at the moment, all the
evidence suggests otherwise.

31:11.740 --> 31:13.700
Hohoho!

31:17.740 --> 31:19.700
What am I gonna do with you?

31:21.060 --> 31:22.700
Delilah called.

31:23.940 --> 31:26.010
She wants to see us tomorrow.

31:26.060 --> 31:28.020
So she's serious.

31:29.180 --> 31:33.010
A real live kid in this
madhouse. Poor sod.

31:33.060 --> 31:35.570
It won't be mad for too
long. Shelter in Hounslow say

31:35.620 --> 31:38.010
they can give Miriam a place
by the end of the week

31:38.060 --> 31:40.900
and I'm going to ask Father
Joe if he'll put Kevin up.

31:41.380 --> 31:44.090
He'll miss the boy. He's
good with him, you know?

31:44.140 --> 31:47.490
Yeah, well, technically he's
breaking his terms of bail

31:47.540 --> 31:49.650
by being here with you, a felon.

31:49.700 --> 31:53.090
Me?! I'm not the one
getting into punchups.

31:53.140 --> 31:56.010
You're going to have to start
acting like a normal person.

31:56.060 --> 31:59.530
Plus, cut that out. Plus, start
having meals at meal times,

31:59.580 --> 32:01.610
instead of just alcohol and nicotine.

32:01.660 --> 32:03.660
Yeah, OK, OK, OK.

32:04.860 --> 32:06.940
We're going to make it work, Steve.

32:08.860 --> 32:10.860
You, me and the boy.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.000
And the babysitter, Kevin Russell.

32:53.860 --> 32:57.090
We still haven't been able
to trace the mother's family.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.100
Can I?

33:06.580 --> 33:08.540
I'm fine, thanks.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.260
Oops.

33:17.580 --> 33:19.090
- Emma.
- Emma.

33:19.140 --> 33:21.140
Emma.

33:22.980 --> 33:26.820
- Timothy.
- I like that name.

33:29.060 --> 33:30.660
- Byebye.
- Byebye.

33:35.180 --> 33:38.500
Obviously, we still have to do the home visits.
- Whatever you need.

33:39.700 --> 33:41.740
You're not going to like this.

33:42.460 --> 33:44.170
It came from the police.

33:44.220 --> 33:46.170
That nice detective, Nick Staines.

33:46.220 --> 33:50.010
He trawled through all the news
footage from 2003, and found this.

33:50.060 --> 33:53.860
There. Kevin Russell outside his workshop.

33:54.980 --> 33:58.210
When is this? When they found Linda?

33:58.260 --> 34:01.410
No. It's the day after
Linda was reported missing.

34:01.460 --> 34:04.570
The first place they searched was
the school and the school grounds.

34:04.620 --> 34:07.170
Kevin helped them. It
gives the prosecution

34:07.220 --> 34:10.170
a plausible theory why Kevin
reburied Linda's body.

34:10.219 --> 34:13.010
He moved her back to a place
he knew had been searched.

34:13.060 --> 34:15.489
What chance of the
police searching it again?

34:15.540 --> 34:17.409
It's just a theory.

34:17.460 --> 34:19.659
Blows a big hole in your theory.

34:20.300 --> 34:23.170
This, plus the photos of Linda,

34:23.219 --> 34:25.770
plus the family refusing the exhumation,

34:25.820 --> 34:28.810
which you need to prove
your forensic anomalies,

34:28.860 --> 34:30.620
it's not a case you'll win.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.860
You should look at making a deal.

34:36.420 --> 34:40.130
No. I'm gonna take the gloves off.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.570
- I'm leaking these.
- Emma, this isn't right.

34:42.620 --> 34:45.250
What, and letting our
client get screwed is?

34:45.300 --> 34:48.090
I do this, it puts a
spotlight on Tony Pullings

34:48.139 --> 34:50.330
and it'll panic him and
whoever's handling him.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.810
- You really think that?
- You think Tony came forward,

34:52.860 --> 34:55.050
risked prosecution,
because he's a nice guy?

34:55.100 --> 34:57.690
- Why not?
- Because it's crap!

34:57.740 --> 35:00.770
Because there's something
else going on here.

35:00.820 --> 35:03.850
There's a police coverup,
or a paedophile ring

35:03.900 --> 35:06.490
or they're protecting someone
on the American base.

35:06.540 --> 35:08.540
You sound completely nuts.

35:09.220 --> 35:10.980
Then I must be on to something.

35:12.340 --> 35:14.180
Let's go, Dom.

35:16.820 --> 35:19.980
When this kicks off, I need
you to be watching Pullings.

35:36.140 --> 35:38.530
- Yes?
- 'You should turn on your TV.'

35:38.580 --> 35:42.290
- What is it, sir?
- 'You overplayed your hand.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.370
You need to move Pullings, right now.'

35:44.420 --> 35:47.410
'.. nude photographs of the
murdered teenager Linda Simms.

35:47.460 --> 35:52.220
Also revealed is the identity of the man who
allegedly took the photos, Tony Pullings.'

35:56.540 --> 35:57.170
Hello.

35:57.220 --> 36:00.010
'You're blown. I'm moving
you now somewhere safe.'

36:00.060 --> 36:01.930
Banville's guy's already outside.

36:01.980 --> 36:04.260
'Don't worry about him. Five minutes.'

36:07.180 --> 36:08.890
What does it mean for Kevin Russell?

36:08.940 --> 36:11.450
The police are going to have
to look much more carefully

36:11.500 --> 36:13.490
at all the circumstances of Linda's death.

36:13.540 --> 36:15.610
- Who leaked the photos?
- 'The key question is...

36:15.660 --> 36:17.530
Where have the photos been all this time?

36:17.580 --> 36:19.290
What did the police know about it?'

36:19.340 --> 36:22.410
- 'You think it's a coverup?'
- 'I don't want to speculate.

36:22.460 --> 36:24.850
But I do want to appeal to
anyone who knows anything

36:24.900 --> 36:27.730
about the sort of photoshoots
that Linda had to do.

36:27.780 --> 36:30.420
Please contact me. I'm Emma...'

37:13.860 --> 37:15.810
Jesus Christ!

37:15.860 --> 37:18.050
Any cameras on this street?

37:18.500 --> 37:19.500
What?

37:50.080 --> 37:53.110
I am so sorry.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.830
- Agh!
- God, no, sorry!

37:55.880 --> 37:58.160
- I'm such an idiot. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

38:00.680 --> 38:02.830
At least you weren't nuts.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.750
There is something going on.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.430
The people who did this were pros.

38:06.480 --> 38:10.470
It's a classic countersurveillance
move... take out the watcher.

38:10.520 --> 38:13.120
AND they got Pullings.

38:15.320 --> 38:18.000
- And who are they?
- I dunno.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.950
I want what you have on Miriam Attar.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.710
What changed your mind?

38:33.760 --> 38:36.150
Banville stopped playing by the rules.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.950
Really? What did she do?

38:38.000 --> 38:40.310
None of your business.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.230
Is it about the photos of the girl?

38:42.280 --> 38:45.390
- Did Banville leak them?
- None of your business.

38:45.440 --> 38:48.040
So give me what you have
on Miriam Attar or get out.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.990
There are calls from
overseas, Lebanon and Syria,

38:57.040 --> 39:00.510
going to a series of numbers
my friends don't recognise.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.790
They believe those numbers are conduits

39:02.840 --> 39:05.990
through which Yusef Attar is
fundraising and recruiting in the UK.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.430
These numbers, where are they?

39:08.480 --> 39:12.390
Triangulation places them all in a
quiet little street in London N16.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.470
Banville.

39:14.520 --> 39:18.830
So, in addition to leaking nude photos
of a murdered teenager to the press,

39:18.880 --> 39:22.680
she allows a terrorist recruiting
network to be run out of her home.

39:23.680 --> 39:25.880
How long will you let that go on?

39:40.040 --> 39:43.270
Did you get a result?
Did anyone come forward?

39:43.320 --> 39:45.640
- Any other girls?
- No.

39:46.480 --> 39:52.350
I played dirty... I exposed that
poor girl, and I got nothing.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.400
Nothing.

39:57.600 --> 40:01.480
Mike, Leila will be
transcribing your Arabic lines.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.430
Arabic lines from where?

40:04.480 --> 40:06.710
Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.950
- Cool. Anyone from my list or...
- Just Ruby.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.840
Excuse me.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.390
Straight flush.

40:19.440 --> 40:22.750
- I got you, mate.
- You lucky bugger.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.960
There you go... four Hobnobs and a Jaffa Cake.
- Yeah.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.830
- Who's in the house?
- Attar,

40:34.880 --> 40:36.910
Banville's boyfriend, Kevin Russell.

40:36.960 --> 40:39.390
- Well, well.
- What do we need for a go?

40:39.440 --> 40:42.670
Evidence of communication with
terrorists and terrorist suspects.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.720
Call coming in. Landline.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.080
Hello?

40:52.520 --> 40:54.470
Steve, there's a call.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.430
She says she's from the adoption agency.
God.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.520
Hold that thought, Kevin.

41:01.480 --> 41:04.350
Who is getting adopted? You're
not talking about Karim?

41:04.400 --> 41:06.360
Hello? Delilah. Yeah, what's up?

41:11.800 --> 41:13.800
Yeah, I'll let Emma know.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.720
Thanks, yeah. Bye.

41:17.720 --> 41:21.790
What's happening? You're not
going to have Karim taken away?

41:21.840 --> 41:23.840
Why would we wanna do that?

41:25.320 --> 41:27.390
You're not touching them cards, are you?

41:27.440 --> 41:29.400
No, mate. I won!

41:39.760 --> 41:41.750
'Hello? Hello?'

41:50.960 --> 41:53.270
Yes. Yes, it is.

41:53.320 --> 41:56.830
Thank you. A call's being made
to a known ISIS number in Raqqa.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.150
Bravo Charlie, this is Alpha. We are go.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.840
- 'Charlie team on the move.'
- 'On the move.'

42:03.680 --> 42:06.120
- 'Bravo team on the move.'
- 'Copy that.'

42:09.080 --> 42:11.080
'Approaching target.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Bravo team in position.'

42:17.000 --> 42:18.960
'Charlie team in position.'

42:20.440 --> 42:22.440
'Bravo team, hold.'

42:24.440 --> 42:26.440
'Holding.'

42:29.360 --> 42:31.870
'This is Alpha, we are go. Go, go, go!'

42:31.920 --> 42:34.760
- 'Bravo team on the move.'
- 'Alpha team, we are go.'

42:35.680 --> 42:37.910
Armed police! Get down on the floor!

42:37.960 --> 42:39.950
- Get down!
- Armed police!

42:45.600 --> 42:47.560
- Who's that?
- It's Banville.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.430
What the hell is going on in here?

42:55.480 --> 42:57.590
Let go of her! No, Kevin, don't!

42:57.640 --> 42:59.800
- Give her back her kid! Agh!
- No!

43:00.920 --> 43:02.750
- Get them out of here.
- Karim!

43:02.800 --> 43:05.870
- You have no right to be in here!
- A serious crime was taking place.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.710
- What crime?
- You got all the phones?

43:07.760 --> 43:10.950
You have no right to take that. I
am going to sue every one of you!

43:11.000 --> 43:13.880
- Take her out.
- Take your hands off of me!

43:15.680 --> 43:17.360
Remember, you are my lawyer.

43:24.920 --> 43:26.880
Em?

43:31.040 --> 43:32.880
You OK?

43:34.280 --> 43:36.240
Er, yeah.

43:43.960 --> 43:45.920
Delilah called.

43:47.800 --> 43:51.000
She said that the local authority
are OK with us to foster...

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
depending on a home visit.

43:58.280 --> 44:01.320
Which this might...

44:04.240 --> 44:06.560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.080
I'm going to go get some fresh air.

44:13.840 --> 44:15.840
Yeah.

44:22.840 --> 44:24.800
OK, wrap it up.

44:40.560 --> 44:43.560
Emma Banville. Hello?

44:44.800 --> 44:46.760
'I saw you on TV.'

44:49.240 --> 44:51.190
OK.

44:51.240 --> 44:53.190
Can I help you?

44:53.240 --> 44:55.200
'It's about that Tony Pullings.'

44:59.640 --> 45:03.070
- Why aren't we getting this?
- Because you said to wrap it up.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.310
Well, unwrap it!

45:05.360 --> 45:07.360
Did you know him?

45:08.520 --> 45:10.830
'Yeah. He photographed me.'

45:10.880 --> 45:13.150
How old were you?

45:13.200 --> 45:14.960
'15.'

45:16.120 --> 45:17.950
Did you know Linda Simms?

45:18.000 --> 45:19.910
- Did you know about her?
- 'Yeah.'

45:23.960 --> 45:26.120
Will you meet me?

45:27.680 --> 45:28.800
Yeah.
