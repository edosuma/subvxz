01:58.285 --> 02:00.370
- Anything to report?
- Nothing unusual.

02:00.412 --> 02:03.790
They're all staying put,
they may move in tomorrow.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.543
And Agent Gray?

02:06.543 --> 02:08.169
He's waiting nearby.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.223
Give me the key.

02:20.599 --> 02:22.059
I'll drive you, sir.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.478
I'm going alone, keys.

02:24.519 --> 02:25.687
But chief...

02:28.815 --> 02:30.067
I understand.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.665
The company is
expecting me tomorrow.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.086
- I'm not here.
- I understand, sir.

PARK HOON-JUNG

04:35.442 --> 04:37.319
How was your flight?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.823
Yeah, I know economy sucks.

04:42.032 --> 04:42.574
You know what?

04:42.616 --> 04:45.160
I tried very hard to get
you a business class,

04:45.160 --> 04:47.746
but there's been cutbacks
in our budget.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.289
Sorry.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.126
You're not going to order something?

04:54.294 --> 04:57.923
I know this is a shitty neighborhood,
but this restaurant

04:58.340 --> 05:01.218
they make a pretty decent steak,
I gotta tell you.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.096
So,

05:07.057 --> 05:08.642
where did you come from?

05:09.684 --> 05:10.685
Erbil.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.730
Erbil?
Are we talking Iraq?

05:17.025 --> 05:20.612
You know what?
You always struck me like a field guy.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.323
I knew you would come.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.285
You seem so free,
got nothing to do?

05:28.537 --> 05:31.289
You see,
our friends in Beijing,

05:31.998 --> 05:35.961
they agreed to step back
and look the other way,

05:36.044 --> 05:38.839
and the target won't
be able to move until tomorrow.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.757
Yeah, we don't need to rush.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.846
If Beijing is stepping back,
why not just do it yourself?

05:46.471 --> 05:47.514
You see,

05:47.514 --> 05:52.686
the condition of the agreement was
that we would play this quietly.

05:53.144 --> 05:57.190
But, this whole thing might
end up messy and bloody.

06:00.443 --> 06:03.947
Thus, the call for help, again?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.075
Son of a bitch...

06:07.117 --> 06:09.995
Come on. You're my friend.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.623
Just do me this favor and
I pay you back I promise.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.250
I always pay you back.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.045
It's very simple.

06:19.421 --> 06:24.676
All you got to do is to escort
the subject out of that building,

06:25.260 --> 06:29.097
and gently put him in the car,
which is parked over there.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.724
That's all.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.895
This one's for you. A little gift.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.855
It's a Tokarev.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.565
No serial.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.611
And here is the key to that building.

06:44.279 --> 06:47.198
There're 9 guards on the premise

06:47.657 --> 06:51.411
and we're gonna close down
the surveillance cameras for 15 minutes,

06:51.453 --> 06:54.039
so that's gotta be
enough time for you.

07:04.466 --> 07:07.093
You try some,
it's very good.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.099
Now what the hell
did you do that for?

07:15.393 --> 07:17.228
I wasn't finished.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.274
Enjoy your fucking meal.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.695
Well, I gotta...

07:27.864 --> 07:29.908
I gotta order another one.

1. Prologue

09:36.242 --> 09:41.748
<i>5 years ago
Sinuiju, North Korea</i>

12:05.266 --> 12:06.476
Fuck...

12:18.696 --> 12:20.698
He's the girl's father.

12:21.199 --> 12:24.244
He was killed as soon
as he opened the door.

12:41.844 --> 12:42.720
Her brother.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.056
A regional judo athlete.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.203
Is that all?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.039
Well, unit chief...

13:15.545 --> 13:16.546
Gun...

13:18.506 --> 13:19.966
isn't this a gunshot wound?

13:20.675 --> 13:21.926
The thing is...

13:23.886 --> 13:24.846
Unit chief!

13:29.517 --> 13:31.811
Worthless piece of shit.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.564
Report properly.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.399
I'm sorry.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.655
Goddamn bastard...

14:33.122 --> 14:34.874
What did you just say?

14:37.835 --> 14:40.129
You want to let
that asshole go?

14:44.300 --> 14:45.676
Director comrade...

14:46.969 --> 14:48.388
Are you serious?

14:49.138 --> 14:52.642
If not, what else can we do?

14:54.435 --> 14:56.187
Are you even
looking at the photos?!

14:56.229 --> 14:58.231
That's quite enough!

14:59.982 --> 15:01.526
Look here,
comrade Lee.

15:01.818 --> 15:06.030
Why are you stirring things up
in my division?

15:07.240 --> 15:08.241
What?

15:08.533 --> 15:12.245
You should've stayed
in Bureau 35,

15:12.662 --> 15:14.831
why come here
to cause a stink?

15:15.873 --> 15:17.417
What are you implying?

15:18.126 --> 15:20.253
How is my background
relevant to this case?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.839
I'm causing a stink?

15:23.214 --> 15:25.049
Forget it, here.

15:28.219 --> 15:28.761
Your order.

15:28.803 --> 15:29.220
<i>Executive Order</i>

15:29.804 --> 15:33.224
You and your underlings
are reassigned

15:33.975 --> 15:36.310
to a fertilizer plant in Daeryong.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.438
What?

15:39.522 --> 15:41.524
Consider yourself lucky.

15:42.150 --> 15:46.946
Had you not served our country,
or the Bureau 35 abandoned you,

15:48.114 --> 15:50.241
you should be in a prison camp.

15:55.455 --> 16:00.543
I've had enough of you,
hand over your ID and gun!

16:20.938 --> 16:23.399
<i>Hurray for North Korea!</i>

16:55.890 --> 17:00.770
You can smile now,
don't be so nervous.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.482
Turn her head around.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.858
- Like this?
- Yeah.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.234
You can do better.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.944
Wake the hell up.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.071
Wow, good, very good.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.615
Take a photo of me too.

17:12.615 --> 17:13.616
Closer.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.117
Please...

17:16.243 --> 17:17.828
don't kill me...

17:17.869 --> 17:20.915
- What did she say?
- "Don't kill me."

17:21.999 --> 17:25.461
Gonna talk about
that brother of yours again?

17:25.920 --> 17:27.255
The judo athlete?

17:27.255 --> 17:29.590
He's gonna mess us up, eh?

17:31.342 --> 17:32.969
What could this be?

17:33.010 --> 17:34.136
Give me that.

17:35.096 --> 17:37.723
Your brother didn't put up
much of a fight.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.563
Oh yeah, you got
a 5-year-old brother, right?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.815
I think we tied him up
to the window.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.069
You wanna know about
any other family members?

17:51.946 --> 17:53.030
No one?

18:16.971 --> 18:18.055
Hey, look.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.224
Let me see.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.038
Hold still,
that's it, very good.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.000
You'll feel good soon.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.628
How is it? Feels nice?

18:49.920 --> 18:51.172
Tell me.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.016
Hold her, hold her down.

21:49.016 --> 21:54.230
<i>3 years later

22:01.278 --> 22:02.822
What's that by her legs?

22:04.573 --> 22:06.575
We're so fucked...

22:10.830 --> 22:13.207
Make sure there's
no gap in between.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.084
Yes, sir.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.128
No, not over there,
send more men here.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.383
Boss, how much higher?

22:22.800 --> 22:25.135
Not there, just send me more.

22:25.719 --> 22:26.971
Is it him?

22:27.346 --> 22:28.347
Yes.

22:28.889 --> 22:33.352
The way she was tortured
and the killing method are the same.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.437
Let's go, we'll be late.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.439
What?
Just leave?

22:37.690 --> 22:39.149
What's the point of staying?

22:39.650 --> 22:41.652
Rain's coming,
let's hurry.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.490
Dammit, come with me.

22:47.241 --> 22:49.243
We're just gonna leave?

22:58.836 --> 22:59.879
It's raining!

22:59.920 --> 23:02.089
Go get some plastic cover!

23:02.339 --> 23:04.341
Come on!
Hurry the hell up!

23:04.884 --> 23:06.802

<i>in addition to strangling wounds,</i>

<i>the police stated that killing method</i>

23:22.985 --> 23:25.237
<i>is similar to that of

<i>Head of the task force,
Det. Jo Sung-oh</i>

23:27.823 --> 23:30.576
<i>could not overcome

23:30.868 --> 23:33.412
<i>Seoul Metro Police stated that</i>

23:33.454 --> 23:37.625
<i>Det. Jo's body was found
at a hill behind his home.</i>

23:37.666 --> 23:40.920
<i>Burned charcoal was discovered
inside his vehicle,</i>

23:40.961 --> 23:43.380
<i>and no will was found inside.</i>

<i>Jo's body was moved

<i>and the funeral will be held

2. The Suspect

24:12.368 --> 24:16.789
<i>Shit, the case can't be
anymore fucked up.</i>

24:17.539 --> 24:19.375
Jo, that bastard.

24:20.125 --> 24:24.129
How could he drop everything
and kill himself?

24:24.922 --> 24:26.423
Fucking coward...

24:27.466 --> 24:32.221
We're about to be
fucked in the ass.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.140
We're already fucked.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.852
Son of a bitch...

24:41.021 --> 24:45.234
Anyway, I got no one else
to replace him.

24:45.484 --> 24:50.781
Even if there was a candidate,
it'll take time to fill him in.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.243
Honestly,

24:54.868 --> 24:59.123
you were the go-to man
on the field before Jo.

24:59.498 --> 25:03.877
Why don't you get your boys
and wrap this up quickly?

25:05.045 --> 25:07.464
I know how you feel about this.

25:07.965 --> 25:10.009
I really do, shit...

25:10.759 --> 25:15.222
It wasn't long ago when we
tried to kick you off the force.

25:15.764 --> 25:16.765
Right?

25:19.184 --> 25:21.228
What about my suspension?

25:21.478 --> 25:22.771
Is that revoked?

25:23.022 --> 25:25.482
Isn't that obvious?
Of course.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.693
Not gonna make excuses later?

25:27.776 --> 25:31.363
Trust me for once!
You want it in writing?

25:33.282 --> 25:34.616
Just solve it.

25:34.825 --> 25:37.453
Once you do that,
I'll make sure

25:38.037 --> 25:39.913
your record is crystal clear.

25:40.831 --> 25:43.083
Solve it by
any means necessary?

25:46.253 --> 25:49.298
Yes, but go easy.

25:49.465 --> 25:52.176
I know you go off the books.

25:52.426 --> 25:55.596
If you go out of bounds,
it'll have consequences.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.723
Take it easy, okay?

25:58.182 --> 26:00.017
Then find the perp that way.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.185
Son of a...

26:02.811 --> 26:05.439
Decide now,
I'll be late for the funeral.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.276
Yeah, do whatever you please.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.361
Just solve the case.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.532
Understood.

26:17.785 --> 26:21.497
No bruises, he's gotta be
presentable to the media!

26:21.497 --> 26:23.457
Don't make him a cripple!

26:23.916 --> 26:24.917
Chae!

26:31.298 --> 26:34.843
<i>Jo Sung-oh</i>

27:10.337 --> 27:11.797
<i>Fight another day!</i>

27:28.313 --> 27:30.357
<i>To: Det. Jo Sung-oh</i>

27:38.532 --> 27:39.825
What's that?

27:39.825 --> 27:40.826
Sir?

27:41.326 --> 27:43.245
These are tips we received.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.371
Put it here.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.753
We usually check them all,

27:51.837 --> 27:54.298
but after Det. Jo's suicide,

27:54.381 --> 27:56.300
we didn't get a chance yet.

28:08.437 --> 28:09.813
We got a call from the lab.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.398
The lab?

28:12.232 --> 28:13.358
They got something?

28:13.400 --> 28:16.111
Did we send them a sample?

28:16.528 --> 28:17.529
I did.

28:19.740 --> 28:22.034
A month ago
before I got the boot.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.494
Got a problem?

28:27.831 --> 28:30.000
- And?
- They found something.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.420
- Come.
- Yes, sir.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.299
Suit up!

28:41.178 --> 28:46.099
It was inside the eggplant
that was in the victim #7's vagina.

28:46.141 --> 28:48.894
It was so small that
we overlooked it the first time.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.813
But we found this
just like you said we would.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.065
Take a look.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.318
They're epithelial cells
under the fingernail,

28:56.610 --> 28:58.445
they don't match
the victim's DNA.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.405
Okay, so this must be...

29:00.405 --> 29:03.492
It's identical to the tissue
sample found on her,

29:03.575 --> 29:05.577
so it's from the suspect.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.455
"Suspect"?
Are you new at this?

29:08.622 --> 29:11.625
It's the perp,
this fucker is the killer.

29:13.168 --> 29:15.087
But not 100%.

29:15.462 --> 29:16.546
- Take care.
- See you.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.589
- Bye.
- Okay.

29:18.006 --> 29:21.677
Put together a list of ex-cons
who killed the same way.

29:22.052 --> 29:24.721
Obtain DNA from all suspects,
anything we can compare to.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.765
- Find them, got it?
- Yes, sir!

29:26.807 --> 29:28.809
Obtain DNA samples
from these guys.

29:28.850 --> 29:29.810
Oh, this?

29:29.851 --> 29:33.063
Chief, we received
a few of them already.

29:33.230 --> 29:36.024
When something happens
we get bogus tips like these.

29:36.066 --> 29:39.111
Our hands will be tied,
if we have to check all of them.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.574
What I mean is...

29:45.158 --> 29:48.287
The hospital bastards won't
cooperate since it's illegal...

29:52.332 --> 29:55.961
And you must not know
about these pricks...

29:56.336 --> 29:58.005
Det. Jo also had to...

30:04.011 --> 30:05.053
So damn yappy.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.014
Shut your hole
and stand up straight.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.056
At attention.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.224
Hurts...

30:09.266 --> 30:11.143
You grew a tongue
while I was away.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.186
- Did you forget how I work?
- No, sir.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.565
Should I care
who these pricks are?

30:16.857 --> 30:17.566
I'm sorry, sir.

30:17.607 --> 30:22.195
I don't care who they are,
unless they're the killers.

30:22.654 --> 30:23.655
Of course.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.367
Right, the hospital.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.580
They won't cooperate,
it's illegal.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.457
So what?

30:34.958 --> 30:36.585
Will you halt the case
because of that?

30:36.668 --> 30:37.502
No, sir.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.047
Why don't you use
that goddamn excuse?

30:40.380 --> 30:43.633
Say you can't catch the killer
for lack of cooperation.

30:43.842 --> 30:44.968
I'm sorry, sir.

30:49.556 --> 30:52.976
Stop being sorry.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.604
Yes, sir.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.315
You got that?

30:58.690 --> 30:59.900
Yes, boss!

31:01.568 --> 31:04.363
I know how you worked till now,

31:04.738 --> 31:06.990
leave the badge
if that's all you got.

31:07.074 --> 31:10.035
The only thing that should be
in your head is the killer.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.371
The process means shit.

31:12.454 --> 31:15.707
Focus on catching that fucker
and putting cuffs on him.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.167
Everything else...

31:18.585 --> 31:21.129
is totally irrelevant to you,
got that?

31:21.588 --> 31:22.631
Yes, sir.

31:23.632 --> 31:24.466
Got that?

31:25.175 --> 31:26.343
Yes, boss!

31:26.468 --> 31:27.719
Then move!

31:31.264 --> 31:32.557
Bastards...

31:37.187 --> 31:41.441
<i>Lack of any progress
has the citizens frightened.</i>

31:41.650 --> 31:45.737
<i>Unable to leave the house freely,
the citizens want the police...</i>

31:48.198 --> 31:51.910
Shit, we're so fucked.

31:55.747 --> 31:56.915
Is the info solid?

31:57.249 --> 31:59.251
You saw the report.

31:59.626 --> 32:02.504
The police got it right,
it's those dicks.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.215
How old is the intel?

32:05.382 --> 32:08.260
Fucking Agent Gray
gave it to us an hour ago.

32:10.554 --> 32:11.680
An hour ago?

32:12.806 --> 32:13.807
That's bullshit.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.561
Only top ranking officers
can see this report.

32:17.727 --> 32:20.480
Come on now,
this is Seoul.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.899
It's like their home ground.

32:22.983 --> 32:24.776
Good for them.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.571
So what?

32:27.863 --> 32:29.489
Get with it.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.992
Do you even need to ask?

32:33.410 --> 32:35.203
What a moron.

32:38.123 --> 32:39.124
Look.

32:44.296 --> 32:48.008
This can't happen.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.470
These dicks...

32:52.762 --> 32:56.057
especially that big dick
cannot be the suspect.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.438
When they were
brought here <i>2</i> years ago,

33:02.105 --> 33:06.818
I planned it
and you carried it out.

33:08.069 --> 33:10.864
And we both got cushy jobs
because of it.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.869
It's been a month
since we got a new boss.

33:16.077 --> 33:19.039
Promotion announcement
will be made soon.

33:21.124 --> 33:24.294
We backed the wrong horse,

33:24.377 --> 33:28.924
so if we don't stop this,
both of us are out.

33:29.424 --> 33:32.302
I told you to go easy
with playing politics.

33:33.220 --> 33:34.638
I knew that old man
wouldn't last long.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.681
Fuck that shit, asshole.

33:37.182 --> 33:40.352
This is a jungle,
everything is politics.

33:40.894 --> 33:43.647
The weak is torn apart.

33:44.147 --> 33:47.817
And who watched
your back till now?

33:49.152 --> 33:50.487
So what then?

33:52.531 --> 33:53.240
Bury the whole thing?

33:53.281 --> 33:56.451
The Yankees won't stay put.

33:56.743 --> 34:00.038
They went apeshit trying to
get those dicks out of the North.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.375
The company will find out,
and there'll be backlash.

34:03.416 --> 34:07.254
We'll settle that later,
but locate them first.

34:07.587 --> 34:10.590
If they're desperate,
they'll give us something.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.967
That's our only play right now.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.469
What about their handlers?

34:15.679 --> 34:18.431
I'm sure they had some,
what have they been doing?

34:18.556 --> 34:20.308
I know...

34:21.601 --> 34:25.688
We received orders to
go easy on the dick.

34:26.356 --> 34:27.357
From whom?

34:28.400 --> 34:29.359
That bastard Gray?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.820
But that's not all.

34:31.860 --> 34:34.489
He messed up with my agents.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.701
It all went to hell.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.873
Your temper can wait,
let's get a move on though.

34:44.416 --> 34:48.753
I sent some agents over there,
we gotta find a way out first.

34:51.755 --> 34:58.138
If we're not careful,
it's a one-way to hell.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.230
Yeah?

35:07.230 --> 35:08.607
<i>The police are on the move.</i>

35:08.607 --> 35:09.566
How?

35:10.025 --> 35:12.027
I'm sure they haven't
got a warrant yet.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.613
<i>Emergency arrest, probably.</i>

35:16.906 --> 35:18.116
Where are you?

35:18.408 --> 35:19.784
<i>We're almost there.</i>

35:20.535 --> 35:22.954
What have you been doing?
What's taking so long?

35:23.538 --> 35:25.081
Taking a trip somewhere?

35:25.749 --> 35:27.876
<i>I'm sorry, sir,
there's a bit of traffic...</i>

35:29.794 --> 35:32.672
Hurry, secure the target first.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.031
You owe me one, okay?

35:58.406 --> 36:00.408
Debt is there to be paid off.

36:00.909 --> 36:03.411
Call me if you need anything,
I'll pay back big time.

36:03.453 --> 36:04.913
Very good.

36:05.205 --> 36:09.459
But this is no easy foe,
will you be okay?

36:11.419 --> 36:14.881
A VIP from North Korea,

36:15.715 --> 36:18.176
the agency won't be too pleased.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.764
We're not in a position to
take their feelings into account.

36:23.556 --> 36:26.476
My predecessor committed
charcoal-burning suicide,

36:26.518 --> 36:29.771
if this doesn't work out,
my team'll be next.

36:30.355 --> 36:33.608
But isn't that why
you got reinstated?

36:33.942 --> 36:35.777
Life is full of ironies, no?

36:36.361 --> 36:43.034
He got you the disciplinary action,
but also gave you a lifeline.

36:43.618 --> 36:44.703
Am I right?

36:45.662 --> 36:47.831
Everything's blessing in disguise.

36:51.835 --> 36:52.836
Yes?

36:53.294 --> 36:54.504
Okay, got it.

36:56.256 --> 36:56.840
It's ready.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.384
I'll go fuck him up
and hand him over to you.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.429
We're around for
the show and cake.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.472
Det. Chae.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.350
Good luck.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.648
<i>We arrived here first,</i>

37:13.690 --> 37:15.358
<i>but the police barged in.</i>

37:15.400 --> 37:17.944
So what? Did you
secure the target?

37:17.944 --> 37:19.362
<i>Well...</i>

37:19.362 --> 37:22.657
<i>we haven't exactly
secured the target...</i>

37:38.590 --> 37:39.841
Make Way!

37:42.135 --> 37:43.386
Don't shove!

37:55.440 --> 37:56.775
Out of the way!

37:58.526 --> 37:59.861
Make Way!

38:28.848 --> 38:30.099
Kim Gwang-il.

38:43.029 --> 38:46.407
You're under arrest in violation
of the National Security Law.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.284
That's bullshit!

38:56.543 --> 38:58.169
Here are your rights.

38:58.628 --> 39:02.006
You have the right to remain silent,
and to consult an attorney.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.591
Anything you say may be...

39:03.633 --> 39:05.009
That'll do.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.263
I can finish that.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.309
How about an intro?

39:21.526 --> 39:23.528
Intelligence? Nice.

39:25.238 --> 39:27.574
He broke the National Security Law.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.701
He'll need to come with us.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.412
National Security Law?

39:32.787 --> 39:34.455
Right, that.

39:35.540 --> 39:38.042
We're in a bind,
this complicates things.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.714
He's a murder suspect,
serial killing, no less.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.842
You know those recent
Southern Seoul killings?

39:46.301 --> 39:47.594
This is him.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.222
You got evidence?

39:52.599 --> 39:55.476
That should be discussed
with the lawyers.

39:58.605 --> 40:01.774
No need to worry,
we got irrefutable evidence.

40:03.735 --> 40:07.113
Anyway, we arrested him first,
we have the jurisdiction.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.074
We'll aid your investigation later.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.911
Come on now.

40:13.202 --> 40:14.954
That's not how this works.

40:22.629 --> 40:24.130
See this?

40:24.964 --> 40:27.175
It's a warrant,
an arrest warrant.

40:27.383 --> 40:30.762
A warrant issued by
a great district judge himself.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.056
You got one too? No?

40:34.140 --> 40:36.434
Then the jurisdiction is ours.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.981
Wanna bypass the court too?

40:43.483 --> 40:45.443
Come on, boys!
Take him away.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.611
- Sure!
- Yes, sir!

40:46.945 --> 40:49.572
Out of the way,
make way.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.535
Thank you and take care.

41:04.879 --> 41:08.800
You said the warrant
was being taken care of!

41:08.841 --> 41:12.512
<i>My contacts at the court
bailed on me.</i>

41:12.553 --> 41:14.555
That's your excuse?

41:14.597 --> 41:18.017
<i>Fine, hold on,
I'm gonna get the court...</i>

41:18.017 --> 41:19.978
That ship has sailed.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.063
The police aren't idiots.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.482
They can reach out to
the media and have a feast.

41:24.524 --> 41:25.525
<i>Personnel File: Chae Edo</i>

41:25.692 --> 41:27.694
Come on, this isn't
a normal case.

41:27.777 --> 41:29.779
It's a serial killing case.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.573
If this blows up,
it's all game over.

41:33.574 --> 41:36.619
Once Chae Edo goes on TV,
we're finished.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.998
Do everything in your power
to stop him.

41:42.834 --> 41:46.337
Send a lawyer to Kim and
tell him to stall the investigation.

41:47.213 --> 41:51.676
Get nearby security cam feeds
before the cops do.

41:51.759 --> 41:52.760
Right away.

41:52.969 --> 41:57.056
What about Kim's minions?
Have you secured them?

41:57.181 --> 41:58.558
Well, they must've...

41:59.100 --> 42:02.395
gone dark, we can't
find them anywhere.

42:02.937 --> 42:04.188
- Both of them?
- Yes, sir.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.607
For some time,
it looks like.

42:08.693 --> 42:12.530
Fucking idiots, is this
how they managed them?

42:12.864 --> 42:14.365
Find them at any cost.

42:14.407 --> 42:17.744
The lawyer can't stall too long,
find them before then.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.954
Get their corpses
if you have to.

42:20.496 --> 42:21.497
Yes, sir.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.083
Let's move!

42:33.468 --> 42:36.554
3. Attack and Defense

43:55.842 --> 43:58.845
Please... don't kill me...

43:58.970 --> 44:02.181
I didn't do anything wrong,
please let me go...

44:07.770 --> 44:10.773
As it's pointed out
in the fax I sent earlier,

44:11.023 --> 44:16.279
my client was on a road trip
with his friends in the south

44:16.779 --> 44:20.241
during the estimated time
of the murder.

44:21.576 --> 44:25.329
And this is a list
of his alibis.

44:25.788 --> 44:28.708
We'll have to look into that.

44:29.333 --> 44:31.919
How do you refute
the DNA evidence?

44:32.712 --> 44:35.131
Why was your client's DNA
found inside the victim?

44:36.215 --> 44:38.885
Oh that...

44:39.969 --> 44:42.763
Shit, so he can talk.

44:44.390 --> 44:47.185
I thought you were
a goddamn mute.

44:51.564 --> 44:58.029
And you don't stare down
at cops here in the South.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.575
That stupid smirk...

45:03.075 --> 45:05.077
Alright, spill it then.

45:05.745 --> 45:08.289
How did your DNA come
out of the victim's vagina?

45:11.959 --> 45:15.129
We started a weekend farm
as a hobby.

45:16.130 --> 45:19.675
We got a small land
near our home.

45:20.927 --> 45:23.846
It's got some cucumber
and eggplants too.

45:24.180 --> 45:24.972
Here.

45:26.182 --> 45:27.767
Quite a bit of eggplants.

45:27.892 --> 45:30.853
They give away the harvest
to their friends and neighbors.

45:31.729 --> 45:35.066
This is hardly irrefutable.

45:35.691 --> 45:38.194
We'll look into this as well.

45:38.277 --> 45:41.614
So you arrest first
and come up with evidence?

45:42.365 --> 45:45.034
Get with the times, detective.

45:45.409 --> 45:48.371
If you find more
solid evidence, call us.

45:48.955 --> 45:50.957
Please release him ASAP.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.628
The warrant was issued today.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.381
We can still...

45:58.923 --> 46:00.925
hold him for another 42 hours.

46:06.931 --> 46:09.433
Anyway, see you again.

46:12.812 --> 46:14.814
Oh yeah, Mr. Kim.

46:16.816 --> 46:18.818
You don't know me well yet.

46:20.278 --> 46:24.573
Keep that smirk on
while you can.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.785
Motherfucker...

46:32.748 --> 46:33.833
Buddy.

46:34.792 --> 46:38.754
I only said we got your DNA,
but nothing about an eggplant.

46:39.964 --> 46:42.341
How did you know
it was off an eggplant?

46:43.592 --> 46:46.262
And you even prepped
a photo of the farm too.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.144
Open up.

46:59.900 --> 47:03.195
They take me
for a goddamn fool?

47:04.196 --> 47:06.824
Dig into his alibis' whereabouts.

47:06.824 --> 47:09.577
Find everything and anything
you can about these pricks.

47:09.577 --> 47:10.828
- Got that?
- Yes, sir.

47:10.828 --> 47:11.620
Anything from his house?

47:11.662 --> 47:13.164
We ransacked it
but nothing useful.

47:13.914 --> 47:15.249
What about his minions?

47:15.291 --> 47:16.792
I sent out APB for their arrest.

47:16.834 --> 47:19.962
Find them fast, asshole,
they're accomplices.

47:20.254 --> 47:20.963
Of course, sir.

47:20.963 --> 47:22.590
- Find them, assholes!
- Sure.

47:23.382 --> 47:26.802
Go to the info division
and dig into the lawyer.

47:27.136 --> 47:29.347
Check his bank records
and see who paid his retainer.

47:29.388 --> 47:32.350
How can we do that?
Stop asking me to shit...

47:33.768 --> 47:36.228
I mean, how will you
handle the backlash?

47:36.687 --> 47:38.814
You son of a bitch...

47:39.065 --> 47:41.233
You'll make me say it again?

47:41.442 --> 47:42.485
Sorry, sir.

47:42.526 --> 47:46.906
I'll take care of the shit,
only think about the result!

47:47.031 --> 47:48.324
You still don't get it?

47:48.366 --> 47:49.408
Yes, sir, I get it.

47:49.450 --> 47:51.869
Get a move on,
why're your feet on the ground?

47:54.205 --> 47:55.998
You two, track the alibis.

47:56.082 --> 47:57.917
- Get a move on!
- Yes, sir!

47:58.793 --> 48:00.002
Run, assholes!

48:05.257 --> 48:08.719
Thought you could fool me?

48:20.731 --> 48:24.235
<i>Cafeteria</i>

48:31.409 --> 48:33.411
- Over here!
- Sorry about that.

48:33.661 --> 48:35.955
- Took you long enough.
- Sorry.

48:36.580 --> 48:37.873
- Are you new?
- Yes.

48:37.957 --> 48:40.459
- It took so long.
- Lunch is here!

48:41.794 --> 48:43.796
Sorry for being late.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.090
It's all cold.

48:55.683 --> 48:57.309
Come get lunch.

48:57.351 --> 48:58.727
Good work, everyone.

49:03.732 --> 49:06.861
Security cams near
Kim's home and work

49:07.069 --> 49:08.612
were already taken
by the intelligence.

49:08.863 --> 49:09.905
It's okay.

49:10.072 --> 49:11.866
There are enough cams out there.

49:13.659 --> 49:15.911
We got tons of dash cams.

49:16.162 --> 49:18.080
Taking some of them
won't hurt us.

49:18.456 --> 49:19.957
Go through what we got.

49:20.207 --> 49:23.002
Scour every minute
and every second.

49:23.461 --> 49:25.880
- We'll get a hit.
- Yes, sir!

49:26.338 --> 49:28.340
Let's split it up evenly.

49:30.176 --> 49:31.343
Firewall is off.

49:32.386 --> 49:33.721
Frequency tracking is completed.

50:04.543 --> 50:07.796
Can we mirror
what they're watching?

50:08.506 --> 50:10.674
Yes, if they are online.

50:10.716 --> 50:12.176
Bringing it up on #1.

50:18.641 --> 50:20.643
- That one as well.
- Corning online.

50:24.813 --> 50:27.399
Those dumb fucks...

50:27.525 --> 50:30.986
They're gonna
comb through everything?

50:35.115 --> 50:36.700
Sitrep on Kim's boys.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.163
Not yet, sir.

50:41.288 --> 50:45.543
Cops will be all over them,
put more agents on it.

50:46.669 --> 50:47.670
Yes, sir.

50:52.883 --> 50:54.677
<i>Police Station</i>

50:54.843 --> 50:56.554
<i>Cafeteria</i>

52:15.299 --> 52:16.925
Chief, I think I got a hit!

52:18.844 --> 52:19.720
Let's see.

52:24.600 --> 52:26.560
Here! I got him too!

52:26.685 --> 52:28.270
- Where?
- Seoul tollgate.

52:32.441 --> 52:33.859
Chief! Here too!

52:33.942 --> 52:35.069
Me too.

52:35.861 --> 52:36.945
Over here.

52:42.451 --> 52:44.453
Guess what that is.

52:45.204 --> 52:48.123
Go on a road trip?
Your alibis?

52:50.042 --> 52:53.379
You got a teleportation machine?

52:55.839 --> 53:00.094
Check the date and time.

53:00.260 --> 53:04.473
We found you in Seoul,
here, here,

53:05.599 --> 53:06.892
and here too.

53:09.645 --> 53:13.982
So, your alibis were elsewhere
during that time.

53:17.569 --> 53:20.948
Got anything to say?
Anything at all?

53:23.325 --> 53:25.160
You're fucked, asshole.

53:25.703 --> 53:27.413
Where's that smirk?

53:54.314 --> 53:55.315
Yes.

53:59.111 --> 54:00.362
I understand.

54:03.907 --> 54:05.492
We'll move in right away.

54:07.870 --> 54:08.871
Yes, sir.

54:22.593 --> 54:24.887
We found him,
Kim's minion.

55:05.719 --> 55:08.055
Drink, it's Solomon's seal tea.

55:14.728 --> 55:16.730
Without company approval,

55:18.482 --> 55:23.070
what have you two been doing
with American spies?

55:24.988 --> 55:26.240
I'm sorry, sir.

55:26.949 --> 55:28.408
Paul Gray...

55:29.660 --> 55:33.163
of all the agents,
you sided with the worst one.

55:33.956 --> 55:35.874
Didn't something feel fishy?

55:36.041 --> 55:37.918
Kim Gwang-il is
the son of Kim Mo-sul,

55:38.252 --> 55:41.880
<i>the account homer of
North Korea's Jang Sung-taek.</i>

55:42.339 --> 55:44.842
CIA has never handed over
anyone like him before.

55:45.259 --> 55:46.510
Those fuckers...

55:46.969 --> 55:50.013
already knew who
Kim Gwang-il was.

55:50.889 --> 55:53.392
And you two took the bait
without knowing anything.

55:53.725 --> 55:55.519
Dumb fucks...

56:00.440 --> 56:01.441
So?

56:04.069 --> 56:04.820
Pardon?

56:04.820 --> 56:07.239
So what will you do now?

56:08.323 --> 56:11.368
The police debunked the alibis,
they're under pressure too.

56:14.037 --> 56:17.833
Alibis were intended to
buy us time.

56:27.759 --> 56:29.928
Can you finish the job
without him?

56:31.722 --> 56:34.808
Taking his head is enough,
I don't need yours too.

56:35.267 --> 56:37.811
Get the police off your back,

56:38.353 --> 56:40.898
and wrap this up by
handing Kim over to CIA.

56:44.401 --> 56:47.529
If this ends well,
you'll see another day.

56:48.238 --> 56:50.699
If the company reputation
is tainted,

56:51.700 --> 56:56.622
you two will be our scapegoats
for all to see, got that?

56:58.332 --> 57:01.460
Yes, sir,
I'll sort it out quietly.

57:03.629 --> 57:05.672
Drink up,
it's getting cold.

58:04.773 --> 58:08.193
I couldn't reach you,
so I had to drop in.

58:08.318 --> 58:11.571
If I'm not reachable,
that means something.

58:12.280 --> 58:15.784
Are you thick?
Did you do okay in school?

58:17.661 --> 58:18.912
I have something to tell you.

58:19.079 --> 58:23.875
I know what you'll say,
and I told your boss off.

58:24.710 --> 58:27.963
You're in no position to
tell us to halt the case.

58:29.631 --> 58:32.092
We're not doing this
over a parking ticket.

58:32.300 --> 58:35.929
It's a serial killing case,
with 7 confirmed victims.

58:36.471 --> 58:41.351
If this doesn't get solved soon,
the media will have my neck.

58:41.935 --> 58:46.857
My apologies to you,
but I can't help you on this.

58:47.816 --> 58:49.818
To each his own.

58:50.193 --> 58:53.196
And don't find me
at a place like this.

58:53.613 --> 58:54.906
It's embarrassing.

58:55.073 --> 58:56.742
This is rather awkward.

58:56.908 --> 58:58.744
I'm not asking you to halt.

59:00.662 --> 59:02.039
Continue the case.

59:02.998 --> 59:03.999
But...

59:06.209 --> 59:08.253
I'd like to give you something.

59:08.420 --> 59:09.171
What?

59:10.005 --> 59:12.049
Another freebie?

59:15.052 --> 59:16.845
Let's help each other.

59:22.476 --> 59:23.685
Get him ready.

59:26.521 --> 59:27.981
What's going on?

59:28.940 --> 59:30.067
Come with us.

59:30.692 --> 59:32.569
Will he be okay?

59:33.361 --> 59:36.406
He was raised by Kim's family
like their own pet.

59:37.074 --> 59:39.034
<i>He will die for Kim.</i>

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.559
Shit, what's this?

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:10.690
What did you just say?

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:12.317
Release Kim?

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:15.195
We got the real killer,
so let him go.

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:21.326
No, he's not the one.
Kim's the real killer.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.453
That bastard is just a pawn.

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:25.080
Take a look.

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:27.290
What is it?

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.251
It's from the lab.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.920
The pawn's DNA was recovered

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:35.590
from victim #3, 5 and 7's
personal items.

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:38.260
Is that so?

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:43.181
How do evidence we
couldn't find suddenly surface?

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:44.850
And this.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:46.935
You must have this too.

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:49.521
This guy was captured
on security cams

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:52.232
near where the bodies
were found.

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:54.776
And we got a full confession.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.194
So who else is the killer?

01:00:57.279 --> 01:01:00.699
Where did you get these?
Who gave them to you?

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:05.829
Detective, this is enough.
Let's wrap it up here.

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:08.331
We got the killer,
so that's that.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:12.627
They went this far
to make us look good,

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:14.921
why not return the favor?

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:17.174
"They"?

01:01:20.427 --> 01:01:21.928
Hand Kim over.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.652
Eyes forward when driving.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:38.987
Sir? Sorry.

01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:44.117
Finish Kim's report tomorrow
and release him to the prosecution.

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:46.578
What? But that's...

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.622
Shut the hell up.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:50.415
Yes, sir.

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:54.127
Press conference in the morning
so get the media.

01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:57.130
Wait, drop me off at my place,
I need to change.

01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:58.173
Okay.

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:10.602
I'll be right over,
so go finish up the report.

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:12.979
What? But chief!

01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:14.981
- Shut up and go.
- Yes, boss.

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:16.274
- Go on.
- Bye.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.435
Who is it this time?

01:02:55.397 --> 01:02:57.691
Thought you wouldn't be
home tonight again.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:00.485
Who are you?
You don't look familiar.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:05.115
Maybe wrong house?
I don't remember cuffing you.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:16.876
That's you, isn't it?

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:18.545
So?

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:20.547
How's Gwang-il doing?

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:32.475
Who are you?

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:44.112
You look like a hunting dog.

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:47.032
We must be in
the same line of work.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:51.119
Kangwon province?
Your accent is familiar.

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:53.663
Up north.

01:03:53.747 --> 01:03:57.250
North? Northern Kangwon?

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.420
You got a case on Kim?

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:02.505
12 confirmed victims.

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:07.635
4 cases in which he wiped out
the victims' families.

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.930
You're being dramatic.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.821
How does it look?

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:30.533
Similar killing method,
isn't it?

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:38.583
He toys with the victim
and kills her in the end.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:51.554
I'm from the North.

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:54.724
To catch that
bloodthirsty fucker.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:03.066
Lee Dae-bum,
Security Division.

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:20.250
<i>Det. Kim</i>

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:33.096

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:41.980
You're under arrest in violation
of the National Security Law.

01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:43.273
You have the right
to remain silent...

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:45.984
What the fuck's going on?!

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.194
Fuck off, asshole.

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:51.114
That fuck's mine,
don't you dare step in!

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:52.532
Chief, you can't do this.

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:55.285
Enough of this bullshit
and get the fuck out.

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:58.037
You got shit in your ears?

01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:00.081
What do you think
you're doing?

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.584
This matter has been settled.

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:04.169
Son of a bitch...

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:07.964
Chief, calm down,
it's an order from the top!

01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:09.632
Let go.

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:12.385
Let go of me.
Let go.

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:13.595
Chief, please...

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:16.931
Sons of bitches,
are you all nuts?

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.683
Chief, just this once.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.103
You smirk?

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:25.106
Is that a smirk?
Motherfucker!

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.191
Stop that!

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:27.817
Don't touch him!

01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:31.905
Did you just laugh?
Is this funny?

01:06:33.364 --> 01:06:36.326
But it's funny,
should I cry instead?

01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:39.245
You bitch...

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:50.089
Have you heard that sound?
It's my favorite.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:55.512
What sound does
a dying person make?

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:58.932
Especially when
the young girls die.

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:06.314
The moan of pain.
It's something.

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:09.192
Demented bastard...

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:16.950
How did the funeral go
for the idiot who offed himself?

01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:19.160
Shut your mouth.

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:22.872
What sound do they make
when they suffocate?

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:29.796
Don't be embarrassed,
your predecessor wasn't the first.

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.005
You little fuck!

01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:34.133
- Hold him back!
- Son of a bitch...

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:34.842
Chief!

01:07:34.842 --> 01:07:35.885
I'll kill him!

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:39.305
Got any more wisdom to spill?

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:40.640
Chief! Chief!

01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:42.809
Kill me?

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:46.854
Pitiful bastards.

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:50.400
If you can,
why don't you?

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:51.651
You bitch!

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:54.279
- Chief!
- Let go of me!

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:56.072
Motherfucker!

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:30.982
You're photogenic.

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:33.067
You didn't know?

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:36.279
You could be an actor.
An action star.

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:44.078
But at least only this site
ran with your story.

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:48.207
Other sites focused
on closing the case.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:57.841
I was up all night calling in
for favors to pull that off.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:01.386
You're suspended for a while.

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:05.475
From arresting and
assaulting a wrong suspect,

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:09.145
your record is filled with assaults,
you should've been fired.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.482
But at least the case is closed.

01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:16.402
We decided to wrap this up
with a short suspension.

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:20.865
Stay low for now, okay?

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.453
Holy cow!

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:27.788
That son of a bitch!

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:46.474
<i>South Korea can't touch him.</i>

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.310
It's a soar eye
to your intelligence division.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.899
Even if you wanted something done,
you got Yankees for a puppet master.

01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:56.442
So what then?

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:01.823
You're saying you can?

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.034
So why didn't you?

01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:09.956
Why let him go wild
and wait till the 12th victim?

01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:15.420
At the time his father Kim Mo-sul
was Jang's right hand man.

01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:21.092
In other words,
he's 'royal family,' untouchable.

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:24.137
We got hit instead.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.225
It was a night ambush.

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:32.311
2 of my men were beheaded,

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:36.858
and I got a bullet
and fell into a river.

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:42.238
All the top brass knew
about it but it was covered up.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:49.871
So what's changed?
What will you do?

01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:55.293
Just before Kim defected
to the South <i>2</i> years ago,

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:59.881
Kim Mo-sul and his men were
charged with counter-revolution.

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:02.967
Which means,
Kim can be executed.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.846
Hand him over.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:11.768
I guarantee you,
the South won't prosecute him.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:20.276
Goddammit...

01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:33.122
4. V.I.P. from the North

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:16.415
- Tired?
- Nope.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:19.335
I doubt that.
Is everything settled?

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:22.547
Yes, just last little bit left.
All docs are shredded.

01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:27.134
Check Kim Ji-won's
border crossing route for me.

01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:21.564
What's this?

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.362
It's you?

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.323
Yes, sir.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.952
About 5 years ago,
in Peshawar, sir.

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:37.371
Oh, Peshawar.

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:43.544
So the Pakistani job
was yours?

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:46.923
I see.

01:13:47.214 --> 01:13:51.802
You field agents belong out there,
why bother with a desk job?

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:56.891
So stick with
what you're good at.

01:13:58.517 --> 01:14:01.270
When is the exchange?

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:05.566
We're in talks.

01:14:07.193 --> 01:14:10.905
Gray won't just take him,
Kim's a handful.

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:14.700
But he won't give up
what Kim knows.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:19.830
We notified them that
we won't babysit Kim.

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:23.584
Good.

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:29.632
Wrap it up nicely,
I don't want any more trouble.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:33.803
Gather up remaining
loose ends as well.

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:36.263
And move into this office.

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:41.310
By the way.

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:44.605
That blind doesn't fit,
change the color.

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:06.419
What is it?

01:15:10.965 --> 01:15:12.299
Where the fuck is he?

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:26.105
I'm sorry,
I went out for a smoke...

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:29.942
Are you fucking insane?!

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:31.027
I'm sorry, sir.

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.378
Kim Gwang-il,

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:52.006
you think we're easy?

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.677
Don't you fret,
I didn't do much with this girl.

01:15:56.969 --> 01:15:57.803
I was simply...

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:13.611
What? "This girl"?

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:22.369
Tell me again,
what did you say?

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:24.246
"This girl"?

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:26.248
There were others?

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:30.628
That handler who was
assigned to me before.

01:16:32.213 --> 01:16:34.215
What about their handlers?

01:16:34.465 --> 01:16:37.093
I'm sure they had some,
what have they been doing?

01:16:37.218 --> 01:16:38.719
I know...

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:45.392
We received orders to
go easy on the dick.

01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:48.771
But that's not all.

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:52.525
He messed up with my agents.

01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.360
You didn't...

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:01.826
I just had some fun with her,
I didn't kill her though.

01:17:03.702 --> 01:17:04.787
You bastard!

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:15.965
Buddy.

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:20.177
Psychotic bastard,
you got a death wish?

01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:23.764
Should I end you?

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:29.520
Is this part of your job?

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:35.860
Shouldn't you be
protecting me till the end?

01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:45.161
The Yankees won't be
too happy about this.

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:47.037
I've had it with you!

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:51.584
Boss, please calm down!
You're gonna kill him!

01:17:52.877 --> 01:17:54.003
Please calm down.

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:00.926
Cuff his feet too.

01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:03.679
Toss him in the corner
so he can't move.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:04.763
Right away.

01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:13.814
Get on the ground!
Hold him tight!

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.303
Shit...

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.851
Who the fuck are you?

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.980
Know when to quit.

01:18:56.065 --> 01:19:00.152
Did it cross your mind
that I don't want to answer?

01:19:01.445 --> 01:19:02.488
<i>Have you considered?</i>

01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:03.948
What?

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:06.659
It's the Northern spy.

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:09.245
<i>I was right.</i>

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:15.125
Fuck you.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:21.423
<i>Will you hand Kim over now?</i>

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:27.096
Are you kidding me?
I've been stripped.

01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:30.683
<i>I can help you.</i>

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:34.436
Help with what?

01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:42.695
The fucker's gone.
Give it up.

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:44.655
The game is over, pal.

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:46.240
<i>No.</i>

01:19:47.408 --> 01:19:48.701
It's not over.

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:57.209
At least I know how to
extend this game.

01:20:05.009 --> 01:20:09.513
<i>Prior to arriving in Seoul 2 years ago,
they stayed in Hong Kong</i>

01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:12.808
<i>and left 2 open cases.</i>

01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:18.689
<i>They tortured, killed the girls,
and recorded the whole thing,</i>

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:25.195
<i>and sold the snuff film
to fund their escape.</i>

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:28.824
<i>Kim is seen in the video.</i>

01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:43.380
<i>Hong Kong Cold Case</i>

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:51.722
If it's Hong Kong...

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:56.477
<i>One of the victims was
a Korean residing in Hong Kong.</i>

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:03.400
Motherfucker...

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:13.327
Did you verify?

01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:15.245
Yes, we did.

01:21:15.829 --> 01:21:17.206
His face is visible.

01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:19.833
Make enough copies
and gather everyone.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.502
Even the off-duty!

01:21:26.006 --> 01:21:29.426
District Attorney,
let me ask you another favor.

01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:48.946
It's been a long, long time,
Mr. Kim.

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:51.448
2 Years, right?

01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:56.370
You look good,
it's gotta be the water in Seoul.

01:21:57.871 --> 01:22:01.959
Now after what I heard,
things are not too going to well for you.

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:04.378
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:08.340
And you picked up
some sick hobby.

01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:11.635
Couldn't you have picked up
something a bit more refined?

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:17.266
Isn't that why
you released me in the first place?

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:19.852
So it would come to this.

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:25.065
You got a point.

01:22:26.066 --> 01:22:27.443
So what now?

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.696
Sounds like you are
in desperate need of help.

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:32.156
Please don't get me wrong.

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:34.992
I don't care what the hell
you were doing in Seoul.

01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:38.370
Now what I am trying to figure out

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:43.459
is what value you hold and
if it's worth protecting.

01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:46.086
Do I really need you?

01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:50.048
Honestly, when I look back on
this last <i>2</i> years,

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:52.050
I'm not so sure.

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:53.719
What do you think?

01:22:56.930 --> 01:23:01.810
Why did you guys relocate me
from Hong Kong in the first place?

01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:05.647
I asked you a question.
You piece of shit.

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:08.901
You haven't changed a lot, huh?

01:23:10.611 --> 01:23:13.405
Now, the only reason
you were relocated

01:23:14.239 --> 01:23:18.118
was because of the Chinese bank account
your father manages.

01:23:18.577 --> 01:23:23.457
And we assumed that he had given
you all the information to that account

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:25.626
when you left North Korea.

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:27.461
So?

01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:29.296
So what?

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:33.884
I think you know
the answer to my question.

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:37.513
We couldn't find any money,
Mr. Kim.

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:40.057
Only some petty cash of yours.

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.519
Which leads me to wonder
if you knew anything at all.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.440
You really think so?

01:23:49.066 --> 01:23:51.151
What I think is not important.

01:23:51.902 --> 01:23:54.530
It's up to you to prove
I'm wrong.

01:23:57.366 --> 01:24:01.912
Oh I forgot to tell you,
some Russians are looking for you.

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:03.705
Oh yeah, you didn't know,

01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:08.627
now, but you see
Mr. Kim spent some years in Russia, yeah.

01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:10.504
Studying right?

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:14.800
Don't you think he pulled up
some sick shit over there too.

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:17.261
You sick fuck.

01:24:18.095 --> 01:24:20.597
Is that why you gave us
this piece of shit?

01:24:20.973 --> 01:24:22.057
Can you imagine?

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:27.479
If this bastard started killing girls
in New York City instead of Seoul?

01:24:28.188 --> 01:24:29.982
How do you think we could handle it?

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:31.692
We can't just pull him out.

01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:37.739
And you guys you didn't suspect
a one single thing, huh?

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.369
You got yourself
a serious problem there.

01:24:42.953 --> 01:24:46.999
You had this guy for 2 years
and you came up with nothing.

01:24:47.874 --> 01:24:50.252
You couldn't even keep him
on a short leash.

01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:52.546
What the hell
are you guys good at?

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:54.464
Jerking off?

01:24:58.218 --> 01:25:00.137
Come on. Hey, stop it!

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:01.346
Easy.

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:04.266
We're trying to make a deal here, okay?

01:25:05.309 --> 01:25:06.435
Thank you.

01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:12.149
Why is that Pyongyang
can't kill my father

01:25:13.483 --> 01:25:15.360
even after they cleaned him out?

01:25:17.195 --> 01:25:21.408
Everyone called my father
a genius when he was a child.

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:25.746
He is very smart up here.

01:25:27.497 --> 01:25:31.627
But you see,
I am smarter than my father.

01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:35.797
You guys want
his banking information?

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:39.301
It's all in here.

01:25:41.094 --> 01:25:42.721
I will give them to you.

01:25:48.518 --> 01:25:52.272
Okay, good.
Now we're talking.

01:25:55.776 --> 01:26:00.238
And let's talk details later on
our side, not here.

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:07.871
How about we take these off
before we talk further?

01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:39.695
The police are here.

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:43.156
The police?
How did they find out?

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.786
Isn't it obvious?

01:26:47.953 --> 01:26:49.955
We got wiretaps too.

01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:52.708
Where are you off to now?

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:57.921
It's a different warrant.

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:04.970
You're photogenic,
you could be an actor.

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:06.346
Perfect for a psycho role.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.599
Yes, sir.

01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:11.601
Out of the way!

01:27:20.193 --> 01:27:22.279
<i>Where should I cut you?</i>

01:27:33.707 --> 01:27:39.171
How could you continue to
cover for him as a fellow human?

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:45.051
Gwang-il, I'm so happy
to see you again.

01:27:46.344 --> 01:27:49.765
I was depressed because
I thought I'd never see you.

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:51.308
Fucking bastard.

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:57.731
Where's that smirk?

01:27:59.065 --> 01:28:02.110
Laugh and smirk
like you did before.

01:28:02.569 --> 01:28:04.488
You son of a bitch.

01:28:07.783 --> 01:28:10.118
You're a tenacious one.

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:14.456
Have some respect
for your elders, you prick.

01:28:21.838 --> 01:28:23.840
Oh yeah, Gwang-il.

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:26.259
By the way.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.303
I figured it out.

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:34.100
The reason why you shove
weird things into vaginas.

01:28:34.935 --> 01:28:37.604
You can't get it up, right?

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:40.232
What?

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:41.691
This.

01:28:45.445 --> 01:28:46.321
Am I right?

01:28:48.281 --> 01:28:49.866
Son of a bitch!

01:28:51.117 --> 01:28:52.160
You wanna die?

01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:53.662
I was right.

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:55.872
I was spot on.

01:28:56.289 --> 01:28:58.416
He can't get it up,
erectile dysfunction!

01:28:58.416 --> 01:28:59.626
Motherfucker!

01:29:01.378 --> 01:29:03.713
How dare you attack a cop?

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:05.715
A fucking dickwad.

01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:07.759
Goddamn fuck.

01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:10.512
Buddy.

01:29:12.097 --> 01:29:15.767
I told you,
this is not North Korea.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:20.105
Did I tell you that or not?

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:23.191
Give it up, all of you.

01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:27.946
If you try to intercept him,
I'll toss you in for harboring a killer!

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:31.783
Take him.

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:35.120
Get the hell up.

01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:37.873
Don't be a pussy.

01:29:47.173 --> 01:29:49.843
Wow, that's Chae Edo?

01:29:51.344 --> 01:29:53.096
He doesn't fuck around, does he?

01:29:57.517 --> 01:29:58.894
What's the matter with you?

01:29:59.436 --> 01:30:01.313
You're not gonna go after him?

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:08.153
But do you know where Chae Edo
keeps getting all these information from?

01:30:08.778 --> 01:30:09.779
Here.

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:14.868
And you guys,
you fucking knew about it, huh?

01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:22.125
Because the piece of shit
that you picked up, he ratted, right?

01:30:25.462 --> 01:30:26.963
Oh yeah...

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:35.138
Well, Lee Dae-bum used to work for...
was it called Foreign Operations Bureau 35,

01:30:35.472 --> 01:30:39.517
before he got transferred to
the Police Department up in Northern Pyeongan.

01:30:39.935 --> 01:30:41.645
Now, 3 years ago

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:45.106
while Lee was cracking down
on Kim and his gang,

01:30:45.523 --> 01:30:49.444
Lee got fired, he and his team
got kicked out from the police force,

01:30:49.486 --> 01:30:53.323
and sent to a fucking
fertilizer plant to work their asses off.

01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:58.620
Now, Kim's gang followed,
they killed all of Lee's men.

01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:20.225
You see, to Kim Gwang-il,
Lee Dae-bum is the North Korean Chae Edo.

01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:51.589
Come on, this isn't right.

01:31:55.885 --> 01:31:56.928
Let us through!

01:31:57.262 --> 01:31:58.930
Shutting down the task force?

01:31:59.597 --> 01:32:01.391
Without consulting me?

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:05.729
<i>The case is closed,
what's wrong with that?</i>

01:32:05.812 --> 01:32:07.814
It's far from over!

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:11.192
Alright, fine.

01:32:11.484 --> 01:32:14.237
If this is how you want to play,
I'll take him to the HQ.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.281
<i>Get it together,
you idiot.</i>

01:32:16.573 --> 01:32:19.117
You can't will yourself
through this.

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:22.162
Hand him over
before shit hits the fan.

01:32:22.162 --> 01:32:23.788
What the shit?

01:32:23.955 --> 01:32:25.957
We got new evidence!

01:32:26.332 --> 01:32:28.376
How could you say that
after watching it?!

01:32:28.668 --> 01:32:30.754
Fuck, have you all gone mad?!

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.672
<i>Goddammit...</i>

01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:35.508
Why're you going nuts
over a closed case?!

01:32:36.176 --> 01:32:40.597
Wasn't this a done deal?
The matter's been settled!

01:32:40.722 --> 01:32:43.933
<i>If we continue, we'd be
backstabbing the intelligence!</i>

01:32:45.018 --> 01:32:46.227
<i>Edo, listen...</i>

01:32:46.603 --> 01:32:49.773
<i>The serial killing case is over.</i>

01:32:49.856 --> 01:32:51.316
We got the killer.

01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:53.318
No, you did,
with your team.

01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:55.737
There won't be any more victims.

01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:59.491
<i>Even the Hong Kong cops
swept it under the rug.</i>

01:32:59.616 --> 01:33:02.452
<i>So why did you bring it out
and cause a stink ?</i>

01:33:03.328 --> 01:33:09.167
What about Det. Jo?
Why did he kill himself?

01:33:10.376 --> 01:33:13.588
You're the one who put
an incompetent fuck on spotlight.

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:15.632
You wanted the killer!

01:33:15.799 --> 01:33:19.427
You told me to bring in the killer,
by any means necessary!

01:33:20.011 --> 01:33:22.639
Kim is the real fucking killer!

01:33:22.764 --> 01:33:24.432
You know that, asshole!

01:33:24.474 --> 01:33:25.683
<i>Son of a...!</i>

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:40.073
Motherfucker...

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:53.169
Hand the key and phone in,
and head back with the boys.

01:33:53.336 --> 01:33:55.755
What? Chief, what'll you do?

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:58.049
We'll come with you.

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:02.846
Shut the hell up,
you're all useless fucks.

01:34:03.763 --> 01:34:05.473
Give me the key and phone.

01:34:05.557 --> 01:34:07.392
- Come on, chief.
- Now.

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:16.317
Chief...

01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:27.245
You did good.
Get going!

01:34:53.646 --> 01:34:55.773
Things aren't working out
as you had hoped?

01:34:56.274 --> 01:34:58.026
Shut your fucking hole.

01:34:58.401 --> 01:35:03.323
You have to know your limits.

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:05.074
Fucking bitch...

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:07.202
District Attorney,
it's Chae Edo.

01:35:08.745 --> 01:35:11.789
Are you filled in?
I'll head over now.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:14.876
What?

01:35:15.043 --> 01:35:18.254
I was given an order
not to get tangled up.

01:35:20.965 --> 01:35:23.927
You know my situation,
we're just a third-party.

01:35:24.594 --> 01:35:29.140
It'll look like we interfered
a done deal, right?

01:35:29.933 --> 01:35:34.562
So, drop us from this case.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:39.025
<i>I heard you're suspended,
you should take it easy.</i>

01:35:39.067 --> 01:35:41.444
<i>It' is a crucial case.
You can't do this alone.</i>

01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:43.988
<i>This could be the end for you.</i>

01:37:02.191 --> 01:37:03.276
So what?

01:37:04.569 --> 01:37:06.863
Arrest me for
National Security Law?

01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:09.240
Shit...

01:37:11.367 --> 01:37:12.910
Go on, then.

01:37:17.582 --> 01:37:18.791
No.

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:22.253
I don't really feel like it.

01:37:24.464 --> 01:37:28.926
Lee's status is
a defector anyway.

01:37:31.429 --> 01:37:34.849
He defected after
the incident 3 years ago.

01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:38.936
Probably hunting down
that psycho.

01:37:41.731 --> 01:37:44.859
I guess he wanted to
return home with Kim.

01:37:49.155 --> 01:37:52.533
The agency had a hand
in Kim's defection.

01:37:53.451 --> 01:37:56.496
He couldn't move in while Kim
was under our protection.

01:37:57.580 --> 01:38:01.584
<i>Lee tipped various agencies
just enough to corner Kim.</i>

01:38:03.086 --> 01:38:06.464
<i>He's a former spy,
that's his specialty.</i>

01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:09.342
<i>And? So?</i>

01:38:10.343 --> 01:38:11.969
What will you do with him?

01:38:13.513 --> 01:38:16.516
I know for a fact, he won't stop
until he drops dead.

01:38:16.641 --> 01:38:18.267
He'll keep killing.

01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:29.904
If I let him go,
I'm gonna regret it.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.208
That's enough.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.044
It's out of our hands now.

01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:48.172
The Americans will
take him away.

01:38:49.632 --> 01:38:51.217
People don't live there?

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:56.180
It's their problem now.

01:39:08.401 --> 01:39:09.861
Fucking hell...

01:39:12.738 --> 01:39:14.907
So that North Korean spy
was right.

01:40:08.794 --> 01:40:10.630
I need to take that out too.

01:40:30.525 --> 01:40:32.109
Hey, Chae Edo!

01:40:36.906 --> 01:40:38.574
You motherfucker!

01:41:46.809 --> 01:41:48.728
Put pressure
and get paramedics!

01:42:16.714 --> 01:42:18.966
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:42:21.677 --> 01:42:24.055
What the fuck are you laughing at?

01:42:39.654 --> 01:42:41.197
That fucker!

01:44:23.048 --> 01:44:24.383
Son of a bitch...

01:44:26.469 --> 01:44:27.803
Fucking hell!

01:44:30.848 --> 01:44:32.183
Son of a bitch!

01:44:39.398 --> 01:44:40.983
It's been a while,
Kim Gwang-il.

01:45:01.796 --> 01:45:03.339
Lee Dae-bum!

01:47:20.976 --> 01:47:23.437
You didn't close down the piers.

01:47:28.734 --> 01:47:33.322
I guess it's pointless
to bring him back.

01:47:34.323 --> 01:47:36.116
Good job,
let them take him.

01:47:38.077 --> 01:47:39.161
Yes, sir.

01:47:41.497 --> 01:47:43.207
In any case,
it's over.

01:47:43.624 --> 01:47:46.168
We handed him over to CIA,

01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:48.295
and he was taken
under their custody.

01:47:49.505 --> 01:47:51.298
They can't say shit to us.

01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:57.930
He's former Bureau 35,
Lee Dae-bum?

01:48:48.647 --> 01:48:50.065
<i>Too bad for him.</i>

01:48:52.818 --> 01:48:56.572
He's been living as a ghost
for a few years to catch him.

01:49:01.118 --> 01:49:02.661
But the supreme leader is dead.

01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:12.254
Now, Kim Gwang-il's cohorts
are in control of the country.

01:49:14.923 --> 01:49:20.095
They wiped out Bureau 35
and Jang Sung-taek is in charge.

01:49:23.599 --> 01:49:25.893
And Kim Mo-sul has
been reinstated.

01:51:32.477 --> 01:51:35.439
5. Epilogue

01:51:40.152 --> 01:51:45.407
Present day
Hong Kong

01:54:11.428 --> 01:54:13.013
Very good.

01:54:13.930 --> 01:54:17.517
Agent Park, it's been a while.

01:54:21.063 --> 01:54:25.609
Is South Korea handling
my case again?

01:54:27.152 --> 01:54:32.908
Tell the Yankees
I'm different this time.

01:54:41.375 --> 01:54:44.586
Sure, I bet.

01:54:47.255 --> 01:54:51.635
Your father Kim Mo-sul was
executed with Jang Sung-taek,

01:54:54.221 --> 01:54:56.848
and you'll be too
if you're sent back.

01:54:59.267 --> 01:55:01.812
You can't fool both sides again.

01:55:02.813 --> 01:55:03.980
I know that.

01:55:05.732 --> 01:55:07.067
So what?

01:55:08.568 --> 01:55:12.447
Isn't it obvious?
I'll spill the beans.

01:55:13.782 --> 01:55:16.993
I'll tell them everything I know.

01:55:18.578 --> 01:55:21.164
The Pyongyang account
in China.

01:55:35.262 --> 01:55:36.304
Does it hurt?

01:55:38.014 --> 01:55:41.143
Listen, Agent Park!
What are you doing?

01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:43.603
It's your duty to serve me!

01:55:48.775 --> 01:55:51.778
I asked you a question,
does it hurt?

01:55:53.405 --> 01:55:55.740
Park, you son of a bitch!

01:56:17.095 --> 01:56:19.639
Why are you doing this?

01:56:21.308 --> 01:56:23.101
You can't do this to me.

01:56:25.312 --> 01:56:26.480
Why not?

01:56:29.774 --> 01:56:33.236
Agent Park,
have you gone mad?

01:56:33.612 --> 01:56:35.614
You! Listen...

01:56:36.531 --> 01:56:39.451
Do you know what you just did?

01:56:44.664 --> 01:56:48.877
I told you, I'll give you
everything I know!

01:56:52.881 --> 01:56:54.591
I don't need it.

01:56:59.262 --> 01:57:03.642
Fucking cockroach,
how dare you.

01:57:06.478 --> 01:57:07.521
Paul Gray.

01:57:08.772 --> 01:57:10.482
Bring me Agent Gray.

01:57:11.191 --> 01:57:13.485
I'm wasting my time on you!

01:57:14.361 --> 01:57:15.904
Get me Gray!

01:57:22.118 --> 01:57:24.704
Goddammit...

01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:28.959
Then what? What!

01:57:29.501 --> 01:57:33.213
What do you want?
Tell me what you want!

01:57:37.467 --> 01:57:38.468
Die.

01:57:41.429 --> 01:57:42.389
What?

01:57:45.308 --> 01:57:46.309
Die.

01:58:02.742 --> 01:58:05.161
Fucking bastard!

01:58:20.552 --> 01:58:22.345
Die, motherfucker.

02:00:14.332 --> 02:00:16.042
The thing you wanted.

02:00:38.231 --> 02:00:40.567
What the fuck have you done?
Huh?

02:00:43.528 --> 02:00:48.032
You must know that China is pissed off
at Kim Jong-un for killing Jang Sung-taek.

02:00:49.325 --> 02:00:50.702
Do you really think

02:00:51.286 --> 02:00:54.956
they will let the North Koreans access
the money from Jang's Chinese account?

02:00:58.543 --> 02:01:01.171
An empty fucking can,
you idiot.

02:01:02.255 --> 02:01:04.674
The Chinese cleaned it all out.

02:01:09.721 --> 02:01:12.807
Seriously, you guys didn't know?

02:01:13.808 --> 02:01:15.852
How can you not suspect a thing?

02:01:16.394 --> 02:01:18.772
Isn't that something
you should be concerned about? Huh?

02:01:27.781 --> 02:01:28.782
From now on

02:01:29.365 --> 02:01:31.117
you deal with your own shit.

02:01:31.868 --> 02:01:33.286
Don't call for help.

02:01:35.413 --> 02:01:37.332
You guys don't sign my checks.

02:01:42.045 --> 02:01:44.005
And next time I see you,

02:01:45.507 --> 02:01:46.674
I promise,

02:01:47.383 --> 02:01:49.552
I will snap your fucking neck.

02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:51.346
Yeah...

02:02:10.114 --> 02:02:12.367
Get this fucking shit out of here, now!

02:02:15.578 --> 02:02:16.830
Fuck!
