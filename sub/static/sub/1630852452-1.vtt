04:19.875 --> 04:21.375
[Leda] Oh, no, I prefer the fresh air.

04:21.458 --> 04:24.916

cool it down for you a little bit.

Or, what are you, a teacher?

04:54.041 --> 04:55.166
I'm a professor.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.791
Okay. I see.

05:02.333 --> 05:05.500

It's just, you're in the sun.
I could move your chair if you'd like.

06:54.125 --> 06:55.458
Oh, yeah, I am in the sun.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.083

08:48.000 --> 08:50.625
I told the kids today.
You didn't have them the other day.

08:50.708 --> 08:53.916
-You see that ice cream? That ice cream.
-That ice cream. Okay. Great.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.041
No, but also like the rainbow colored.
You have that?

08:57.125 --> 08:58.583

You gotta put something on her.

-[girl 1] Know what we should do?
-[young Leda] What?

13:27.875 --> 13:30.833
[girl 1] We should stick
googly eyes on his face,

13:30.916 --> 13:34.041
and we should put him in a cage
and decorate the cage.

13:34.125 --> 13:35.291
[young Leda] Mm-hmm.

13:39.208 --> 13:40.625

I was just thinking of calling you.
Just got in from the beach.

14:06.041 --> 14:07.041
What's ruined?

14:08.333 --> 14:10.500
Why did you go to someone you don't know?

14:11.875 --> 14:13.125
It's not ruined.

14:13.208 --> 14:15.708
It just gets really dry
when you dye it so much.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.833
I sometimes put a teaspoon of olive oil…

14:19.541 --> 14:20.375

-You don't mind moving, right?
-No, I'm fine here.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.458
[woman] I'm sorry about earlier.
All right?

19:33.625 --> 19:35.000
It's my birthday.

19:35.083 --> 19:36.791
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.208
-How old are you?
-I'm 42.

19:44.041 --> 19:45.458
[Leda] You got a lovely big belly.

19:46.291 --> 19:49.208
Well, it's a girl. So, you know.

19:50.500 --> 19:53.291
-And how much longer have you got?
-[woman] Two months.

19:54.208 --> 19:56.000
My sister-in-law had hers right away.

19:56.541 --> 19:57.916

-No, it's not fancy.

20:22.708 --> 20:25.875
I thought you were from Queens. I swear.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.500
Not 'cause you talk like it,
but just, like… something.

20:30.791 --> 20:32.041
That's where we're mostly from,

20:32.125 --> 20:35.125
but we have family
in this town for, like, 300 years.

20:35.208 --> 20:36.375
Oh.

20:36.458 --> 20:37.375

You must've started really early.

-Mmm.

-It's good, right?
-It's really good.

21:35.791 --> 21:36.666
Yeah.

21:38.083 --> 21:39.083
Um…

21:40.416 --> 21:43.750
Look, I'm sorry about earlier as well.
I was feeling a bit anxious.

21:43.833 --> 21:47.375
Yeah, well, you know, the sun can do that.

21:47.458 --> 21:52.208
And, well, maybe your girls.
Being away from your girls, you know?

21:52.833 --> 21:55.208
Yeah, well, you'll see.

21:56.625 --> 22:01.416
Children are a crushing responsibility.

22:04.208 --> 22:05.416
Happy birthday.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.041
[twig snaps]

22:20.375 --> 22:22.375
[cockrell crows]

22:28.666 --> 22:31.125
-[thud]
-[shrieks and groans]

22:39.375 --> 22:40.500
Oh.

22:57.208 --> 22:58.416
[inhales sharply]

23:00.666 --> 23:02.666
[blues music playing]

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
[indistinct chatter in distance]

23:43.125 --> 23:44.875
-Hi. Hello.
-Lyle. From upstairs.

23:44.958 --> 23:47.416
-Yeah, of course.
-I'm glad you made it down here.

23:48.708 --> 23:50.708
-It's not so bad, right?
-No.

23:50.791 --> 23:52.791
-I hope we didn't disturb you.
-[Leda] Oh, no, no.

23:54.541 --> 23:55.916
What are you drinking?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.833
Oh, I'm fine. I'm still half full.

23:59.791 --> 24:02.750
Nice to have a place like this,
just down the stairs.

24:03.333 --> 24:06.208
You know, especially when you're alone.

24:06.875 --> 24:11.416
-Keeps you from eating canned beans.
-Or rotten fruit.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.583
[both laughing]

24:15.250 --> 24:18.375
-Uh, I forget to eat entirely sometimes.
-Oh, that's not good.

24:22.041 --> 24:25.625
I saw you at the beach today.
Callie's birthday party.

24:25.708 --> 24:28.750
Oh, well, I wasn't exactly at the party.
I didn't see you.

24:28.833 --> 24:29.875
I saw you.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.416
-You know, you're settling in upstairs?
-Yeah. It's great. Thanks.

24:35.500 --> 24:39.333
-Yeah? Everything's okay in the apartment?
-Yeah, it's great. Thank you.

24:39.416 --> 24:42.416
Did you find that remote?
You know, for the fan?

24:42.916 --> 24:45.166
No, I prefer
to pull the string to turn it on.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.166
-The fan.
-[laughing] Pull.

24:48.041 --> 24:49.666
Pulling the ol' string, eh?

24:49.750 --> 24:51.250
[both chuckling]

24:51.750 --> 24:52.791
[Lyle sighs]

24:54.333 --> 24:56.708
-The apartment's great.
-It's a good one.

24:56.791 --> 24:58.000
Bright and white.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.416
-Feels like you're on a boat almost.
-Yes.

25:03.583 --> 25:05.625
-[Lyle] No, no, I got it.
-Oh, no, really.

25:05.708 --> 25:07.375
-I insist.
-Oh, thank you.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.666
Just let me know
if I can do anything for you.

25:14.750 --> 25:15.750
I will. Thank you.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.958
Do you mind
if I finish my dinner now, Lyle?

25:23.833 --> 25:24.958
Oh, sure.

25:28.666 --> 25:29.791
[sighing]

25:30.833 --> 25:32.208
-Yeah.
-Okay.

25:35.125 --> 25:36.583
[men conversing indistinctly]

26:11.291 --> 26:13.041
[speaks Italian] A beautiful game.

26:17.833 --> 26:18.833
[in English] Sorry.

26:22.458 --> 26:24.333
[men conversing indistinctly]

26:26.750 --> 26:27.583
[Nina] Damn it!

26:31.500 --> 26:34.500
You do whatever the fuck you want.
You wanna take care of your baby girl?

26:34.583 --> 26:35.458
You say you miss us.

26:35.541 --> 26:37.958
You wanna come back and you want me.
You want this ass?

26:43.208 --> 26:45.541
What? You're such a piece of shit.

26:45.625 --> 26:47.125
[Nina's husband] I'm a piece of shit?

26:48.041 --> 26:50.041
[Nina] Fuck you! Hey!

26:58.750 --> 27:00.875

27:26.833 --> 27:29.750
[insects buzzing]

We'll find her, okay?

Hey.

29:46.541 --> 29:48.083
[Elena making noises]

29:49.583 --> 29:50.833
[Elena] I lost my mama.

29:51.875 --> 29:54.416
[Leda] Oh. I'll help you find her.
Come on.

29:58.041 --> 29:59.250

29:59.333 --> 30:00.375
Oh, my God!

30:01.208 --> 30:02.041

Give her to me.

30:20.375 --> 30:22.000
[footsteps approaching]

30:22.750 --> 30:26.083
I just wanted to come say thank you.
[clears throat]

30:26.166 --> 30:27.083
Yeah, it was scary.

30:27.166 --> 30:28.666
[Elena continues crying]

30:31.833 --> 30:33.166
I thought I was gonna die.

30:33.958 --> 30:34.791
Yeah.

30:35.666 --> 30:38.041
Thank God you were here. Thank God.

30:38.833 --> 30:41.625
Sometimes it's easier for strangers
in these situations.

30:41.708 --> 30:44.333
[Callie] Yeah, I was so crazy,
I couldn't see right.

30:44.416 --> 30:47.083
You know, so many awful things can happen.

30:47.166 --> 30:49.250
People are so fucked up. [gasps]

30:49.875 --> 30:50.875
Oh, my God.

30:51.708 --> 30:53.250
What happened to your back?

30:53.333 --> 30:56.958
-It was a pine cone from the beach path.
-[Callie] A pine cone?

30:57.666 --> 31:00.083
That looks so awful.
Did you put something on it?

31:00.166 --> 31:01.291
[Leda] No, I haven't.

31:01.375 --> 31:03.625
Oh, no. No. Oh, I have something for you.

31:03.708 --> 31:05.125
It's so good. Hold on.

31:08.958 --> 31:11.125
-I like your bathing suit.
-[Leda] Oh, thank you.

31:11.208 --> 31:12.333
[Nina] Mm-hmm.

31:12.416 --> 31:14.750
-[Elena crying]
-So she's not calming down?

31:17.375 --> 31:18.500
Yeah.

31:18.583 --> 31:20.250
[crying] Mommy!

31:20.333 --> 31:21.916
-[Nina's husband] Stop.
-[Nina] Weird day.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.166
[Leda] Hmm.

31:23.250 --> 31:25.208
We found her and then she lost

31:26.291 --> 31:27.250
her doll.

31:29.833 --> 31:32.625
I used to have a doll like that.
Called Mina.

31:32.708 --> 31:34.625
-Nina?
-Mina.

31:35.250 --> 31:37.416
Or Mini-Mama, as my mother called her.

31:38.833 --> 31:39.750
You'll find it.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.625
-Yeah.
-[woman] Do you want a toy?

31:42.708 --> 31:45.083
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Elena continues crying]

31:55.125 --> 31:57.375
-[Callie] How's that?
-[Leda] Good, thank you. It's cold.

31:57.458 --> 32:02.083
[Callie] Yes. It's really amazing.
It's gonna make you feel so much better.

32:02.166 --> 32:05.666
Okay, by tonight,
you're gonna feel amazing.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.750
-All right? All right.
-Thank you. Yeah.

32:07.833 --> 32:10.291
[Callie] And let's go.
Let's find the doll.

32:10.375 --> 32:12.500
I… I can't hear her scream anymore.

32:15.666 --> 32:16.583
See you tomorrow.

32:19.375 --> 32:20.666
[Elena crying] Mama!

32:22.125 --> 32:23.083
-Bye.
-[Leda] Bye.

32:36.708 --> 32:39.291
[cicadas chirping]

32:59.000 --> 33:01.333
[young Leda whispers]
I've got a special gift for you.

33:05.041 --> 33:06.125
Open your eyes.

33:08.041 --> 33:09.041
Hmm?

33:09.833 --> 33:12.583
This was Mama's doll
when she was a little girl.

33:12.666 --> 33:15.541
-[Bianca] What's her name?
-Her name's Mina.

33:17.375 --> 33:19.166
-[Bianca] Mummy?
-[Leda] Mm-hmm.

33:19.250 --> 33:22.708
-[Bianca] Can I have a cuddle?
-[chuckling] You can have a cuddle.

33:26.083 --> 33:27.375
Aw.

33:28.666 --> 33:30.666
[thunder rumbling]

33:35.083 --> 33:37.666
[Bianca] Give you some medicine

33:37.750 --> 33:43.250
because then you'll have nice nails.

33:43.333 --> 33:44.458
Yeah.

33:45.250 --> 33:49.125
[Bianca] Very messy.
And you won't get better.

33:49.208 --> 33:50.291
[Leda] Mm-hmm.

33:50.375 --> 33:53.666
I'm just gonna close my eyes
for a few seconds, baby. Okay?

33:53.750 --> 33:54.625
[Bianca] Okay.

33:55.125 --> 33:57.583
Can you see what my eye color is?

33:57.666 --> 34:00.208
-Hmm. Brown?
-[Bianca] No.

34:01.041 --> 34:01.916
They're red.

34:02.583 --> 34:04.166
-Do you see?
-[Leda] Yeah.

34:07.791 --> 34:11.750
[Bianca] Uh, I'll just
have to brush your hair.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.416
Ow! Fuck! Ouch!

34:23.041 --> 34:24.291
Bianca, no!

34:25.583 --> 34:26.541
Ouch.

34:28.250 --> 34:30.125
[Martha crying]

34:30.875 --> 34:34.208
-You said we would have a date.
-I can't just let her cry.

34:34.291 --> 34:38.666
You've got to… I'll give you
a few more seconds to come back.

34:38.750 --> 34:43.375
Three, two, one.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.750
[Martha continues crying]

34:51.041 --> 34:52.041
[sighs]

34:52.750 --> 34:55.583
[Bianca crying]

35:00.583 --> 35:03.166
Here. Why don't you play with Mini-Mama?

35:03.250 --> 35:04.958
You can brush her hair, yeah?

35:06.625 --> 35:10.041
-[Martha] Oh, Mama, come!
-I'll be back in two seconds.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.625
[Martha crying]

35:12.125 --> 35:13.125
[brush clatters]

35:17.416 --> 35:18.500
[young Leda] Bianca?

35:21.458 --> 35:22.375
Bianca!

35:22.916 --> 35:24.666
[Bianca speaking indistinctly]

35:24.750 --> 35:26.791
[Leda] Bianca! Come on! Dinner.

35:28.583 --> 35:30.625
[Bianca] That seems fine.

35:31.250 --> 35:32.375
Are you ignoring me?

35:33.250 --> 35:35.416
I've called you so many times for dinner.

35:36.208 --> 35:37.833
-[speaking indistinctly]
-Bianca?

35:38.458 --> 35:40.583
What are you sitting on? Bianca!

35:43.166 --> 35:44.083
Get up.

35:45.875 --> 35:47.708
Get up. Get up.

35:50.666 --> 35:51.916
[Leda] You don't like her?

35:52.583 --> 35:55.000
I gave Mina to you
because I trusted you to take care of her.

35:55.083 --> 35:57.166
You know, you can be very thoughtless.

35:57.250 --> 36:00.458
This is my doll.
You can't treat her like shit.

36:00.541 --> 36:02.375
No. She's mine.

36:03.958 --> 36:05.750
Yeah, well, she's ruined.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.916
[wind blowing]

36:17.000 --> 36:18.666
[thunder rumbling]

36:20.291 --> 36:22.291
[rain pattering]

36:53.166 --> 36:54.875
-Oh, hi!
-Hi.

36:56.416 --> 36:59.083
-You look like you stayed dry.
-Yeah, was it really bad?

36:59.166 --> 37:00.458
Yeah. No, it was crazy.

37:00.541 --> 37:03.791
Everybody ran into the cafe,
and then it got too crowded.

37:03.875 --> 37:06.916
Umbrellas started blowing away,
people's books, towels, yeah.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.083
-Everyone was freaking out.
-Oh, dear.

37:10.166 --> 37:14.083
Yeah, and the little girl, Elena,
she just… she wouldn't stop crying.

37:14.166 --> 37:16.458
Yeah, she lost her doll or something.

37:17.125 --> 37:18.583
-I like storms.
-[Will] Mmm.

37:18.666 --> 37:21.000
Yeah, well, your books
woulda gotten ruined.

37:21.083 --> 37:22.916
-Oh, did yours get wet?
-Yeah.

37:23.666 --> 37:24.791
What are you studying?

37:24.875 --> 37:26.625
-Business.
-In Greek?

37:26.708 --> 37:28.541
No, no, I'm studying in Dublin,

37:28.625 --> 37:31.041
and I just work here
for the summers, but, uh…

37:32.416 --> 37:34.833
Yeah, I'm a bit behind at college.

37:34.916 --> 37:37.833
You know, I wasted a lot of time.

37:38.625 --> 37:40.125
-Yeah.
-How old are you?

37:40.208 --> 37:42.916
-Twenty-four.
-Oh, right between my daughters.

37:43.833 --> 37:45.041
I heard you're a professor.

37:45.125 --> 37:47.541
[chuckles] I think the correct response
is, "Sounds like fun."

37:47.625 --> 37:50.125
-[chuckling] What?
-It's a rude joke.

37:50.208 --> 37:53.166
-Will sandwich. Yeah.
-[Will chuckles]

37:53.250 --> 37:55.166
Uh, I teach, yeah.

37:55.875 --> 37:58.125
Yeah. Comp lit.
Italian literature, really.

37:58.208 --> 37:59.666
-All right.
-But I'm skiving off.

37:59.750 --> 38:02.250
Right, right, ahem, yeah,
comparative literature.

38:02.333 --> 38:03.833
Mmm. Yeah.

38:04.541 --> 38:07.916
-I saw you know a lot of languages?
-I don't know anything very well.

38:08.500 --> 38:11.125
I also wasted a lot of time. [chuckles]

38:12.500 --> 38:13.833
Do you wanna have dinner with me?

38:15.208 --> 38:17.458
Yeah, I should go shower and change and--

38:17.541 --> 38:18.583
No, you're fine as you are.

38:18.666 --> 38:21.333
-I don't have my wallet.
-Uh, I'm inviting you. Come on.

38:21.416 --> 38:22.583
Okay.

38:22.666 --> 38:24.291
[both laughing]

38:28.208 --> 38:30.500
-That was so funny.
-[coughing]

38:30.583 --> 38:32.583
Vassili is Callie's husband.

38:32.666 --> 38:35.500
Oh, I thought he was married
to the older, heavyset woman.

38:35.583 --> 38:37.541
-Oh, come on.
-What?

38:37.625 --> 38:39.666
-She's fat.
-[gasps]

38:39.750 --> 38:41.875
No, but that's Callie's aunt, I think.

38:42.458 --> 38:45.250
-And Lyle, who looks after my place.
-He works for them.

38:45.333 --> 38:47.041
-Oh…
-Mmm.

38:47.125 --> 38:50.291
-And Nina's husband is…
-Toni.

38:51.125 --> 38:52.458
-Toni?
-Yeah.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.666
Yeah, he, um, comes up the weekends.

38:56.541 --> 38:58.916
He has investments in Kalamata.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.208
-Sounds dodgy.
-Yeah. Mmm.

39:01.291 --> 39:04.541
And then they all rent
one of these huge villas by the cliffs.

39:05.666 --> 39:06.916
It's pink.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.458
-It's pink?
-Yeah.

39:08.541 --> 39:10.958
-[both chuckles]
-They rent the same one every year.

39:11.458 --> 39:15.583
Wow, it's like talking about a film I saw
in a language I didn't quite understand.

39:15.666 --> 39:17.541
You watch movies
in languages you don't know?

39:17.625 --> 39:19.458
-Yeah.
-Without subtitles?

39:19.541 --> 39:20.416
Yeah.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.833
[both laughing]

39:23.750 --> 39:27.125
And you were saying that,
um, your kids are my age?

39:27.208 --> 39:29.708
Yeah, 25 and 23. Bianca and Martha.

39:29.791 --> 39:32.958
Hmm. And do they look like you?

39:33.041 --> 39:35.833
I don't know. It's hard to say,
if I'm honest. They probably do.

39:35.916 --> 39:36.916
Oh.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.250
Because you're beautiful.

39:38.333 --> 39:39.750
[both chuckles]

39:40.958 --> 39:42.958
-You're a very smart boy.
-[both chuckle]

39:44.416 --> 39:45.791
My mother was very beautiful.

39:46.291 --> 39:50.625
And, um, when I was about Martha's age,
I felt like she hadn't shared it.

39:50.708 --> 39:53.083
Like, in creating me
she'd separated herself,

39:53.166 --> 39:56.291
like pushing a plate away
if the food's repulsive.

39:56.375 --> 39:58.500
-[Will] Hmm.
-[Leda] Hmm.

39:58.583 --> 40:00.291
But Bianca and Martha, it's funny.

40:00.375 --> 40:04.625
What I find most interesting
are the secret resemblances.

40:04.708 --> 40:05.791
-[Will] Hmm.
-You know?

40:06.291 --> 40:09.500
So what makes Bianca seductive
and Martha not, and vice versa.

40:09.583 --> 40:10.708
Well, they blame me.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.208
Like, when I was younger,
I had small breasts.

40:16.291 --> 40:18.583
And then as soon as I gave birth,
big breasts.

40:18.666 --> 40:23.541
And Bianca has big breasts,
and Martha has almost none, like a boy.

40:24.291 --> 40:27.375
And she doesn't realize
how beautiful she is.

40:27.458 --> 40:30.500
And she wears a padded bra
and it sort of humiliates her.

40:31.208 --> 40:34.208
And she thinks
I've given the best of myself to Bianca.

40:34.291 --> 40:35.541
She feels deprived.

40:36.541 --> 40:39.833
And, um, I do understand. And, like…

40:40.583 --> 40:42.791
Long time ago,
at some point, I considered,

40:42.875 --> 40:45.625
only half seriously,
considered having implants.

40:45.708 --> 40:51.125
But, um, they come from nowhere,
so what are they worth?

40:52.083 --> 40:52.916
You know?

40:53.458 --> 40:56.041
But Bianca is completely different,

40:56.125 --> 40:58.500
and she would never
let herself feel deprived.

40:58.583 --> 41:02.333
She sucks everything out of me.
All my secret skills.

41:03.333 --> 41:06.083
She pointed out
I'm finicky about peeling fruit.

41:06.166 --> 41:07.000
[Will] Hmm.

41:07.083 --> 41:08.583
I don't like it when the peel breaks.

41:08.666 --> 41:11.833
I like when it comes off
in one long whatsit?

41:11.916 --> 41:14.166
-[WIll] String… [chuckles]
-String. [chuckles]

41:15.125 --> 41:17.250
-Yeah, very, very uptight.
-Yeah. [laughing]

41:17.333 --> 41:19.208
Didn't even know that about myself.

41:21.333 --> 41:24.041
-Yeah, of course I understand.
-[young Leda muttering]

41:24.125 --> 41:27.708
The problem for me is why did they
schedule them so close together?

41:29.291 --> 41:30.875
[young Leda muttering]

41:34.000 --> 41:35.041
Baby… Babe…

41:36.125 --> 41:37.166
Huh?

41:37.250 --> 41:39.750
-[girls crying in distance]
-[whispers] It's Sunday. You're on.

41:40.583 --> 41:41.750
[whispers] It's Columbia.

41:48.625 --> 41:50.666
[muffled]

41:50.750 --> 41:52.500
[crying in distance]

41:52.583 --> 41:54.916
[speaking indistinctly]

41:55.000 --> 41:56.041
I'm working.

41:56.125 --> 41:57.625
I'm suffocating.

41:58.375 --> 42:01.541
-[crying] Please, can you kiss it?
-[Leda] Yeah, sit down.

42:01.625 --> 42:06.041
-Mama, please, can you kiss it?
-Sit down.

42:06.125 --> 42:07.458
[clicking tongue]

42:07.541 --> 42:08.708
What did you do that for?

42:08.791 --> 42:14.083
I wanted to peel it
like a snake like you do. [sniffles]

42:15.375 --> 42:18.458
Please. Please, can you kiss it?

42:19.208 --> 42:21.416
It really hurts.

42:22.125 --> 42:25.791
Mama! [crying]

42:28.208 --> 42:29.833
Kiss it.

42:30.916 --> 42:34.791
[crying] Please. [sniffles]

42:35.625 --> 42:38.958
Please.

42:40.125 --> 42:42.125
[Bianca continues crying]

42:48.416 --> 42:50.583
[young Leda] I can't leave you alone
for one minute.

42:50.666 --> 42:53.750
[Bianca continues crying]

42:57.041 --> 42:59.583
There's this great poem by María Guerra.

42:59.666 --> 43:01.625
"Haciendo serpentinas"?

43:02.833 --> 43:04.333
[Will hesitates] No.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.375
Have you ever read "Leda and the Swan"?

43:06.458 --> 43:07.750
No.

43:07.833 --> 43:09.541
Okay. That's in English.

43:09.625 --> 43:12.041
-Okay.
-Plus, it's my namesake.

43:12.666 --> 43:14.166
"The center cannot hold…"

43:14.250 --> 43:16.958
Oh, that's a different…
that's a different Yeats.

43:18.541 --> 43:19.583
Um…

43:24.166 --> 43:25.208
[grunts]

43:26.208 --> 43:28.041
My mum used to get quite dizzy.

43:28.125 --> 43:31.000
She, um… Every time she stood up,
happened all the time.

43:31.083 --> 43:33.125
She said it's 'cause
she stood up too fast.

43:36.958 --> 43:39.291
Oh, poor creatures
that came out of my belly.

43:39.375 --> 43:43.125
The bits I find most beautiful about them
are the bits that are alien to me.

43:44.125 --> 43:46.083
So I don't have
to take responsibility for that.

43:49.791 --> 43:51.583
-Have I bored you?
-No.

43:51.666 --> 43:53.333
Nina's very beautiful.

43:56.041 --> 43:56.958
Yes.

44:00.750 --> 44:02.416
I hope they find the doll.

44:03.208 --> 44:05.250
They're all freaking out and…

44:06.291 --> 44:08.583
I had to rake
the entire beach looking for it.

44:08.666 --> 44:09.916
-They will.
-Hmm.

44:11.833 --> 44:13.708
What you did yesterday was amazing.

44:14.666 --> 44:16.750
When you wouldn't move from the umbrella.

44:18.666 --> 44:21.750
-But don't do things like that anymore.
-Why?

44:21.833 --> 44:22.791
[clicks tongue]

44:23.541 --> 44:25.166
Because they're bad people.

44:45.750 --> 44:46.750
[sniffs]

44:59.250 --> 45:00.250
[groans]

45:02.875 --> 45:03.750
Ugh!

45:11.250 --> 45:13.250
[vehicle approaching]

45:18.041 --> 45:20.041
[indistinct chatter in distance]

45:59.083 --> 46:01.708
[young Leda] Sometimes I get scared
I can't take care of them.

46:03.916 --> 46:07.000
What if I passed out,
alone with them when you're in Arizona?

46:07.875 --> 46:10.458
[man] Baby, you're okay.

46:11.333 --> 46:12.333
I promise.

46:13.791 --> 46:15.625
Of course you can take care of them.

46:33.083 --> 46:37.625
I'm just gonna take the dress
and the shoes and the socks.

46:37.708 --> 46:39.666
And leave the… Oh, no.

46:39.750 --> 46:42.083
Actually, I'm gonna
take the jacket too. Thank you.

46:46.666 --> 46:47.666
Leda.

46:50.333 --> 46:51.541
-Hi.
-Hi.

46:52.333 --> 46:55.083
-How are you?
-Good.

46:56.541 --> 46:58.083
Do you have grandkids already?

46:58.750 --> 46:59.916
No.

47:00.666 --> 47:02.541
Did you use the ointment I gave you?

47:02.625 --> 47:04.666
Oh, for my back.
Yeah, it feels much better.

47:04.750 --> 47:05.875
-Thank you.
-Oh, good.

47:08.250 --> 47:11.375
Hey. Hey, sweetie,
did you ever find your doll?

47:12.500 --> 47:15.041
-[Callie] Oh, my God.
-Elena, do not do that.

47:15.125 --> 47:16.291
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

47:17.250 --> 47:18.500
[Nina] She's super tired.

47:19.083 --> 47:22.000
Why don't you tell the lady
how we're gonna go

47:22.083 --> 47:25.708
and find Neni tomorrow
when it's not raining, right, honey?

47:25.791 --> 47:28.791
And then today
we're gonna get a doll for a big girl.

47:28.875 --> 47:32.041
'Cause you're Mommy's big girl.
You're my big girl.

47:32.125 --> 47:34.000
Whoever took her should get brain cancer.

47:34.083 --> 47:36.583
[Vassili] Oh, come on.
It's kids' stuff, you understand?

47:36.666 --> 47:38.375
They like a toy, they take it. That's it.

47:38.458 --> 47:40.291
[Callie] No, Arruno's children
aren't like kids.

47:40.375 --> 47:42.416
Yeah, it's their mom. She's a cunt.

47:42.500 --> 47:45.458
[Vassili] I spoke to Toni
and the kids didn't take anything.

47:45.958 --> 47:47.541
-He's lying.
-[Vassili] Don't say that.

47:47.625 --> 47:50.000
-Well, it's true.
-Don't say it.

47:50.083 --> 47:52.333
[Callie] She's been through
a lot, you know?

47:52.416 --> 47:55.541
She's, like, had a fever,
she can't breathe at night.

47:55.625 --> 47:58.166
She needs a Kleenex. We're furious.

47:58.250 --> 48:00.875
-Do you have a Kleenex, actually?
-No, I don't. Sorry.

48:05.750 --> 48:07.083
How high was the temperature?

48:07.166 --> 48:09.916
Barely 100. She's… She's okay.

48:10.750 --> 48:11.833
She's okay.

48:15.041 --> 48:17.916
[Nina] Okay, you wanna let Mama
put you down for a second?

48:19.333 --> 48:20.666
[chuckles]

48:20.750 --> 48:24.000
Come on.
Elena, let Mama put you down. Come on.

48:26.166 --> 48:27.958
-[Elena grunts]
-Stop. Stop it.

48:28.041 --> 48:31.833
Enough. Stop. Enough!
Stop acting like this. Let me…

48:32.916 --> 48:33.750
Fuck!

48:34.958 --> 48:37.250
[breathing heavily]

48:41.916 --> 48:43.750
[sighs] She's driving me crazy.

48:45.083 --> 48:46.333
'Cause Daddy's away, right?

48:46.416 --> 48:49.541
Daddy's away,
and you're taking it out on me.

48:51.750 --> 48:54.458
All right. Come to Auntie, baby.
Come on. Come to Auntie.

48:54.541 --> 48:57.708
There we go, my big girl. Oh! [grunts]

48:57.791 --> 49:00.583
-My big girl!
-Go. So I can have a minute.

49:02.125 --> 49:04.250
Sometimes I just can't handle it.

49:05.416 --> 49:07.666
-I know.
-[Callie] Okay?

49:07.750 --> 49:11.833
-[Elena speaks indistinctly]
-Yes, anything you want. Show Mama.

49:11.916 --> 49:15.291
Show Mama and the lady
what a good girl you are, okay?

49:15.375 --> 49:16.250
Here you go.

49:17.041 --> 49:19.625
You're okay. [kisses] You're okay.

49:22.041 --> 49:23.333
[exhales sharply]

49:24.291 --> 49:26.125
They really put us through it, huh?

49:27.708 --> 49:30.083
I thought you said
you're pregnant with your first.

49:30.166 --> 49:31.291
[Callie] I am.

49:31.875 --> 49:34.166
What were your daughters like
when they were little?

49:34.833 --> 49:36.958
Were they like
this willful little creature?

49:37.583 --> 49:39.750
I honestly can't remember much, actually.

49:41.250 --> 49:44.083
[Callie] Oh, no, you can't forget
anything about your own children.

49:45.875 --> 49:47.083
Is that your experience?

49:49.250 --> 49:53.333
I just mean, did your daughters give you
a hard time when they were little?

49:54.958 --> 49:56.333
I just don't remember.

49:58.041 --> 50:00.333
-[Callie] You okay?
-She doesn't remember.

50:00.833 --> 50:02.375
[Leda] I was very tired.

50:02.875 --> 50:04.000
Sorry, excuse me.

50:04.083 --> 50:06.791
[objects clattering]

50:09.708 --> 50:10.541
Sorry.

50:10.625 --> 50:13.625
Don't bother buying her another doll.
It won't make any difference.

50:14.208 --> 50:15.083
You'll find it.

50:17.291 --> 50:19.083
[thunder rumbling]

50:19.166 --> 50:22.166
-[rain pattering]
-[people clamoring]

50:31.708 --> 50:33.333
[in Italian] Stiamo disturbando…

50:33.416 --> 50:35.791
[repeating in Italian] Stiamo disturbando…

50:36.583 --> 50:39.375
-[young Leda speaking Italian]
-[repeating in Italian]

50:39.458 --> 50:41.916
[young Leda speaking Italian]

50:42.000 --> 50:44.541
[Bianca in English]
Mama, how do you write "volcano"?

50:45.458 --> 50:47.958
[young Leda] …dal nostro intento…

50:48.041 --> 50:50.000
Mama, how do you write "volcano"?

50:52.333 --> 50:57.416
Mama. Is this how you write "volcano"?
Is this how you write "volcano"?

50:59.833 --> 51:00.750
[young Leda] Su te…

51:00.833 --> 51:02.583
-How do you--
-[in English] Don't do that!

51:05.041 --> 51:07.666
-Don't you dare, ever again, Bianca.
-[chuckles]

51:07.750 --> 51:09.833
Listen to me. Don't you dare, ever again.

51:11.375 --> 51:12.541
[Bianca laughs]

51:14.250 --> 51:16.208
You don't hit Mama.

51:17.166 --> 51:19.291
You can never, ever do that.
Do you understand?

51:19.833 --> 51:20.833
-Can--
-Out!

51:21.333 --> 51:22.750
-No! No!
-Out!

51:25.166 --> 51:28.208
-[Bianca] Get off me!
-[young Leda] Give me 15 more minutes.

51:30.083 --> 51:30.916
Down.

I'm just going to go to the bathroom.

I'm gonna make you come.

[Leda] Where the fuck
does Dr. Williams keep her coffee?

54:03.416 --> 54:05.041
Or does she just drink green tea?

54:05.125 --> 54:07.083

54:07.166 --> 54:09.625

Martha, this is Daddy's teacher's house.
Take your shoes off, now.

54:24.833 --> 54:28.333
Your shoes off. You've got to be
very, very careful in this house.

-[Bianca] I'm hungry.
-Daddy's eaten your snack.

54:30.916 --> 54:33.833

make Blitzes so the sun would come out.

Why did you eat them?

54:34.916 --> 54:36.583
Baby, we will. I promise you.

54:53.458 --> 54:54.833
[Leda] Are you kidding me?

54:54.916 --> 54:57.833

-Joe, it's not 1985.

54:57.916 --> 55:01.541
-[Joe] What's wrong with you? They're wet.
-Joe, don't bring them in here!

you've been going a while.

-Yes, we did.

55:33.958 --> 55:34.875
Hmm.

We are obliged
to do so many stupid things.

From childhood, even.

you could pick octopus

Yeah.

[young Leda] I have left
my number and Joe's number,

1:09:31.125 --> 1:09:33.083
and Bianca's school and Martha's daycare.

1:09:33.166 --> 1:09:37.583

1:09:37.666 --> 1:09:39.708
Ah! [chuckling]

1:09:39.791 --> 1:09:41.250
Martha's got a little cold.

1:09:41.333 --> 1:09:45.333
It's nothing really, but she should have
a teaspoon of elderberry in the morning.

1:09:45.416 --> 1:09:47.208
-She can have one of these afterwards.
-Mm-hmm.

1:09:47.291 --> 1:09:50.041
'Cause, you know,
just for being good. [chuckles]

1:09:50.125 --> 1:09:52.375
Um, I also left
a humidifier beside her bed,

1:09:52.458 --> 1:09:55.666
so you can just plug that in at night.
And she loves Cheetah.

1:09:56.250 --> 1:09:59.916
Um, so if she's a bit upset at nighttime,
you can give her Cheetah.

1:10:00.500 --> 1:10:03.458
[sighing] Oh! Yeah,
I left Joe's mum's number,

1:10:03.541 --> 1:10:08.583
and, um-- I mean, I'll call every night
at dinner, so… Thank you, thank you! Ah!

Only call her
if you can't get through to anyone else.

1:10:17.208 --> 1:10:20.791

but didn't get a chance to… Do you cook?

-Mm-hmm.
-I've left the recipe on the fridge. Easy.

Could I order up some wine, please?

1:10:40.666 --> 1:10:42.833
Oh, no, just a-- just a glass. [chuckles]

1:10:42.916 --> 1:10:46.000
Thank you.
Actually, have you got any Champagne?

1:10:47.208 --> 1:10:50.791
Oh, right. No, that's fine, uh…

1:10:50.875 --> 1:10:54.291
How much is a bottle, actually?
I'm celebrating.

-Hi.
-[man] Hi, Leda.

1:11:07.333 --> 1:11:08.875
This is the paper I'm giving.

1:11:10.166 --> 1:11:12.750
I'm not sure it's persuasive.

1:11:13.583 --> 1:11:16.875
Camus posits
that the ontological emptiness

1:11:16.958 --> 1:11:18.833
of the universe

1:11:18.916 --> 1:11:23.125
chafes against
the intrinsically human desire

1:11:23.208 --> 1:11:25.041
for metaphysical meaning.

1:11:25.666 --> 1:11:29.458
[clearing throat]
Consequently, it is jarring

1:11:29.541 --> 1:11:32.041
that Esslin's Theatre of the Absurd…

1:11:42.041 --> 1:11:44.041
[indistinct chatter]

1:12:12.125 --> 1:12:13.333
Bourdieu…

1:12:14.333 --> 1:12:17.666
Bourdieu's mistake is that he often forgot
the first part of his own name.

1:12:17.750 --> 1:12:18.625
[laughter]

1:12:20.291 --> 1:12:23.125
I'm sorry, Walter.
Walter is sensitive. Where is he?

1:12:23.708 --> 1:12:25.416
That's terrible.

1:12:26.666 --> 1:12:28.541
But what I really want to consider,

1:12:28.625 --> 1:12:31.250
and I promise
I'm gonna bring this back to Auden,

1:12:31.333 --> 1:12:35.250
is that which is
not only ineffable [clicks tongue]

1:12:35.333 --> 1:12:36.541
but unthought.

1:12:38.125 --> 1:12:43.083
I've been really turned on
by Ricœur's recent thinking

1:12:43.166 --> 1:12:45.625
on linguistic hospitality and…

1:12:45.708 --> 1:12:47.625
[laughing]

1:12:48.708 --> 1:12:51.083
How about his name, Ricœur…

1:12:51.791 --> 1:12:54.166
Gosh, I should really
lean into that second syllable,

1:12:54.250 --> 1:12:56.250
because, God, he comes from the heart.

1:12:57.291 --> 1:12:58.583
Um…

1:12:59.166 --> 1:13:00.333
The apple…

1:13:03.208 --> 1:13:04.416
An object…

1:13:09.333 --> 1:13:12.083
[both breathing heavily]

1:13:16.125 --> 1:13:21.583
Oh, I'm reading the most astounding piece
on Auden's "The Crisis" by Leda Caruso,

1:13:22.583 --> 1:13:25.333
and it seems to me
that she has anticipated

1:13:25.416 --> 1:13:28.750
Ricœur's recent thinking
on linguistic hospitality.

1:13:28.833 --> 1:13:29.708
For her…

1:13:31.833 --> 1:13:37.916
hospitality comes
in holding one's attention,

1:13:38.625 --> 1:13:39.750
even in crisis.

1:13:40.458 --> 1:13:42.708
As Simone Weil says,

1:13:42.791 --> 1:13:48.041
"Attention is the rarest
and purest form of generosity."

1:13:48.125 --> 1:13:51.250
[young Leda] Suddenly he was
just saying my name. And it was…

1:13:51.833 --> 1:13:54.000
[chuckles] It was crazy.

1:13:54.875 --> 1:13:58.666
He was… No, he was talking
about the Auden publication.

1:13:59.375 --> 1:14:00.833
He was saying that, um…

1:14:01.875 --> 1:14:06.500
He was saying that I had anticipated
Ricœur's work on translation and…

1:14:06.583 --> 1:14:08.583
[both panting]

1:14:09.375 --> 1:14:13.041
That, yeah. That I had anticipated
Ricœur's work on translation,

1:14:13.125 --> 1:14:15.916
and it was just…
I mean, it was… [sputters]

1:14:16.458 --> 1:14:17.833
…wild.

1:14:18.916 --> 1:14:20.208
And Cole looked like

1:14:20.291 --> 1:14:21.416
his eyes were going to…

1:14:21.500 --> 1:14:25.458
He turned around in slow motion.
He was absolutely raging.

1:14:25.541 --> 1:14:29.416
Leda Caruso is inside
Auden's private mythology.

1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:35.291
Thank God, because whenever
one tries to suppress doubt,

1:14:36.625 --> 1:14:37.875
there is tyranny.

1:14:38.583 --> 1:14:40.583
[audience applauding]

1:14:47.708 --> 1:14:49.000
She's got chicken pox?

1:14:50.125 --> 1:14:54.041
That's crazy, she just had a little cold.
Does she have a fever?

1:14:55.250 --> 1:14:56.125
Oh.

1:14:56.208 --> 1:14:58.250
That's not really a fever.

1:14:58.333 --> 1:14:59.375
No.

1:14:59.458 --> 1:15:03.958
I haven't… I haven't even…
I haven't even read his recent work.

1:15:04.791 --> 1:15:06.500
It was all my own thinking.

1:15:09.458 --> 1:15:11.708
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put her on the phone.

1:15:16.916 --> 1:15:18.125
[knocking on door]

1:15:18.208 --> 1:15:20.125
Hi, sweetheart.

1:15:21.333 --> 1:15:24.208
[sighs] Hi. Is it itchy?

1:15:24.291 --> 1:15:27.791
[clicks tongue] Aw, I know.
It's not very nice.

1:15:28.750 --> 1:15:30.291
Did Daddy give you a DVD?

1:15:30.375 --> 1:15:32.250
[knocking on door]

1:15:32.333 --> 1:15:35.708
Yeah, well, just don't forget
it gets a little bit scary when the…

1:15:35.791 --> 1:15:38.333
Um, can you just hang on
one minute, sweetheart?

1:15:38.416 --> 1:15:39.916
-Yeah. Coming. One--

Oh.

1:15:46.708 --> 1:15:49.291
-Sorry to disturb you.
-No, no, no. Not at all.

1:15:49.375 --> 1:15:52.375
I came by to congratulate you
on your success tonight.

1:15:52.458 --> 1:15:53.708
Oh, thank you.

1:15:53.791 --> 1:15:56.458
You'll have to get
the Yeats piece finished now.

1:15:56.541 --> 1:15:59.166
-Another publication is important.
-Yeah. For sure.

1:15:59.250 --> 1:16:02.041
Yes. I'll tell Hardy how we're working.

1:16:03.208 --> 1:16:05.916
Dinner is in 20 minutes
in the dining room.

1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:08.875
I've arranged a seat for you.

1:16:08.958 --> 1:16:11.750
[young Leda] Oh, my goodness.
Um… Thank you.

1:16:30.916 --> 1:16:33.541
Hello. Sorry, I think this is my car.

1:16:37.583 --> 1:16:40.708
-You think it's your car?
-Yeah. It's a rental.

1:16:44.875 --> 1:16:45.958
Excuse us.

1:16:48.125 --> 1:16:51.000
-Lyle tells me you're renting his place.
-Did he?

1:16:51.083 --> 1:16:52.000
[Toni] Mmm.

1:16:52.916 --> 1:16:55.625
I mean, teachers get to take
the whole summer off. That's nice.

1:16:56.125 --> 1:16:57.916
Well, it's a working holiday.

1:16:58.458 --> 1:17:00.458
[Toni chuckles]

1:17:01.625 --> 1:17:02.625
I like it. Yeah.

1:17:02.708 --> 1:17:03.708
Me too.

1:17:05.541 --> 1:17:09.250
You know, thanks for helping
with Elena the other day.

1:17:09.333 --> 1:17:12.583
And with Nina. She can get spacey.

1:17:13.791 --> 1:17:15.291
Sure. Excuse me.

1:17:15.375 --> 1:17:16.583
[door handle thudding]

1:17:17.666 --> 1:17:20.583
-Oh. Not my car. It's…
-No.

1:17:21.875 --> 1:17:23.000
[Leda] Bye.

1:17:28.291 --> 1:17:29.208
[Toni] Bye.

1:17:32.125 --> 1:17:35.125
[indistinct conversations]

1:17:53.583 --> 1:17:55.083
I didn't realize you were here.

1:17:55.958 --> 1:17:59.625
-It's really great to meet you.
-It's great to meet you too.

1:18:00.208 --> 1:18:02.166
Your work is thrilling.

1:18:03.666 --> 1:18:04.666
Thank you.

1:18:05.541 --> 1:18:06.666
Thrilling.

1:18:09.500 --> 1:18:10.458
Thank you.

[Cole sighing]

1:18:23.083 --> 1:18:24.916
He is a serious scholar, but--

1:18:25.958 --> 1:18:28.083
It's amazing to see. Amazing.

1:18:28.166 --> 1:18:29.958
-What is?
-Well…

1:18:31.500 --> 1:18:36.000
It would be interesting to see his tactics
as he renews his pursuit this evening.

1:18:49.375 --> 1:18:50.458
[Leda] Excuse me.

1:19:01.625 --> 1:19:03.625
Where is the waiter?

1:19:04.583 --> 1:19:06.208
Some Champagne, please.

1:19:07.458 --> 1:19:09.916
-[laughing]
-[young Leda] Don't cry! No, no, no!

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:13.708
I loved…
I loved the jokes about their names.

1:19:14.916 --> 1:19:17.416
-It made you seem more human.
-Human?

1:19:17.500 --> 1:19:20.583
-As opposed to what?
-As opposed to a god.

1:19:21.958 --> 1:19:23.416
Ah. Mmm.

1:19:23.500 --> 1:19:27.708
Your name. Leda. It's very provocative.

1:19:27.791 --> 1:19:30.458
[chuckles] You're thinking
about the Yeats.

1:19:31.166 --> 1:19:32.583
[clicks tongue]

1:19:32.666 --> 1:19:35.625
Very high-minded.
It always brings rape to mind.

1:19:35.708 --> 1:19:36.666
Jesus.

1:19:37.500 --> 1:19:39.166
I bet you know it by heart.

1:19:41.208 --> 1:19:42.500
-In Italian.
-Ah.

1:19:47.666 --> 1:19:49.583
"Tutto d'un colpo

1:20:08.791 --> 1:20:10.125
Sconcertante.

1:20:10.208 --> 1:20:12.125
Si, ragazza.

1:20:13.416 --> 1:20:16.083
Sconcertante.

1:20:17.041 --> 1:20:17.958
Mmm.

1:20:22.583 --> 1:20:24.708
[whispering] I want to go to bed with you.

1:20:27.208 --> 1:20:30.333
But it looks like you're married, so…

1:20:34.875 --> 1:20:36.541
you'll have to start this.

-[young Leda gasps] Hi!
-[girls scream happily]

[laughing]

1:21:50.500 --> 1:21:52.500
Hello, little hug monkeys.

1:21:54.875 --> 1:21:57.458
[kissing]

1:21:57.541 --> 1:21:58.958
I missed you.

1:21:59.833 --> 1:22:01.125
-Did you miss me?
-Yeah.

1:22:01.208 --> 1:22:02.708
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:22:17.041 --> 1:22:19.208
-[door closes in movie]
-[man] Hiya, fatso.

1:22:19.291 --> 1:22:23.250
[woman] Fatso is right.
Look at me, bulging out of my own clothes.

1:22:24.208 --> 1:22:26.291
[young men clamoring]

1:22:33.625 --> 1:22:35.833
[chairs clattering]

1:22:45.125 --> 1:22:46.791
[young man 1] I'd fuck that hole.

1:22:46.875 --> 1:22:48.750
[young man 2] Nah, she's too old, yo.

1:22:49.583 --> 1:22:53.208
[young man 1] I'd let her suck my cock
if I didn't have to look at her face.

1:22:53.291 --> 1:22:55.750
-[shushing]
-[all laughing]

1:23:01.416 --> 1:23:04.166
Excuse me, please,
we're trying to watch this film.

1:23:08.375 --> 1:23:09.708
[young man 3] Okay.

1:23:09.791 --> 1:23:13.291
Hey! If you can't control yourselves,
we're gonna have to call the usher.

1:23:13.791 --> 1:23:16.125
The usher! The usher!
She's gonna call the usher, yo.

1:23:16.791 --> 1:23:20.250
[young man 2] Yeah, bitch.
Call the usher! Call that cocksucker!

1:23:21.708 --> 1:23:24.125
[young men chattering loudly]

1:23:30.208 --> 1:23:31.208
Hello?

1:23:35.708 --> 1:23:36.833
Hello?

1:23:39.458 --> 1:23:40.708
Is anyone there?

1:23:40.791 --> 1:23:43.791
-[pounding on door]
-[woman] Yes, yes, yes, yes. Hi.

1:23:45.375 --> 1:23:48.291
Hi. There's a group of boys
being extremely disruptive in theater two.

1:23:49.708 --> 1:23:52.208
-Disruptive?
-Throwing popcorn, shouting at the screen.

1:23:52.291 --> 1:23:54.208
Shouting at other people. Disruptive.

1:23:55.583 --> 1:23:57.250
[woman] Okay. Do you want your money back?

1:23:57.333 --> 1:23:59.083
No. I want you to do something about it.

1:23:59.166 --> 1:24:02.875
[woman] Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry. I can take care of it.

1:24:02.958 --> 1:24:04.875
Just give me a minute here, okay?

1:24:04.958 --> 1:24:06.208
-Thank you.
-[woman] Okay.

1:24:07.833 --> 1:24:09.833
[young men laughing]

1:24:17.208 --> 1:24:18.958
[man in movie] What happened to her hand?

1:24:19.666 --> 1:24:20.625
Fuck you!

1:24:25.083 --> 1:24:26.958
[young men become quiet]

1:24:27.041 --> 1:24:30.916
[woman in movie] You better be beautiful.
A genius, and terribly rich.

1:24:31.458 --> 1:24:35.208
[man] The beauty she got from my daughter.
The genius she inherited from me.

1:24:35.291 --> 1:24:37.916
You better get busy
with your contribution, my boy.

1:24:40.250 --> 1:24:42.625
[woman] The last nine months
I devoted to you.

1:24:42.708 --> 1:24:46.125
Now I'm gonna have fun.
What do you say, sweetheart?

1:24:46.208 --> 1:24:48.083
Whee!

1:24:48.791 --> 1:24:50.791
[all laughing]

1:24:54.875 --> 1:24:56.875
[young men speaking in Greek]

1:24:59.375 --> 1:25:02.166
[movie dialogue continues indistinctly]

1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:07.166
No! I'm gonna cut
your tiny, little dicks off

1:25:07.250 --> 1:25:09.000
and feed them to you like peanuts.

1:25:09.958 --> 1:25:12.416
This is unacceptable!
I'm calling the police!

1:25:12.500 --> 1:25:14.625
Call the police, bitch. Call the police.

1:25:14.708 --> 1:25:18.208
Blue Lives Matter! Blue Lives Matter!
Blue Lives Matter!

1:25:18.291 --> 1:25:19.250
[Vassili] Enough!

1:25:19.333 --> 1:25:21.291
[man 1 in movie]
Not much of a story, is it?

1:25:21.375 --> 1:25:25.416
[man 2] You know how Americans in Paris
love to read about Americans in Paris.

1:25:25.500 --> 1:25:27.333
[man 1] All right. What's your name?

1:25:27.416 --> 1:25:28.333
Fuck you!

1:25:28.958 --> 1:25:30.208
[men in movie laughing]

1:25:32.500 --> 1:25:33.458
[man 2] That's my girl.

1:25:33.541 --> 1:25:34.958
[men in movie continue laughing]

1:25:50.791 --> 1:25:53.208
-[Bianca] Mama, do you have a snack?
-Mm-hmm.

1:25:53.291 --> 1:25:54.541
Did you bring a snack?

1:25:54.625 --> 1:25:56.500
Uh… Oh, shit.

1:25:56.583 --> 1:25:59.958
Um, we'll get something later.
Why don't you go up there and play?

1:26:00.041 --> 1:26:03.541
[Martha] Mama, the balloon man's here.

1:26:03.625 --> 1:26:05.541
I want a whale one.

1:26:06.166 --> 1:26:08.750
I know he can make whales.

1:26:10.125 --> 1:26:12.458
[young Leda speaking Italian]

1:26:12.541 --> 1:26:13.791
Il fulmine!

1:26:15.166 --> 1:26:21.041
[reciting in Italian] La loro vera madre…
La loro vera madre era mia moglie.

1:26:21.583 --> 1:26:23.000
[Hardy growling playfully]

1:26:23.083 --> 1:26:25.250
E il loro vero padre era Zeus.

1:26:27.250 --> 1:26:29.458
Fucking brilliant.
You're so fucking brilliant.

1:26:29.541 --> 1:26:30.625
[Martha] Mama.

1:26:31.166 --> 1:26:32.250
Mmm.

1:26:33.166 --> 1:26:35.375
[in Italian] I don't want
to  come in your mouth.

1:26:35.875 --> 1:26:39.583
I want to wait until you're inside me.

1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:47.958
[in English] Well, maybe it's good for you
not to get exactly what you want.

1:26:49.666 --> 1:26:53.541
Please, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama. Please.

1:26:57.125 --> 1:26:59.458
Oh, fuck, yeah.

1:26:59.541 --> 1:27:04.166
[young Leda] Yes, baby. I'm gonna
get you sweets from London. Mm-hmm.

1:27:04.250 --> 1:27:05.083
What?

1:27:06.583 --> 1:27:07.500
I can't…

1:27:08.458 --> 1:27:10.416
Bia… I can't…

1:27:10.500 --> 1:27:14.208
Bianca, can you turn the phone around?
I can't… I can't hear Martha.

1:27:14.833 --> 1:27:15.833
Hmm?

1:27:16.416 --> 1:27:20.375
Aw! Okay, babies.
I can't wait to see you too. I love you.

1:27:21.125 --> 1:27:23.791
No, you hang up first.
It's better that way.

1:27:24.750 --> 1:27:29.041
Okay. Love you. Bye. Bye-bye. [kissing]

1:27:29.708 --> 1:27:31.666
I love you. [chuckles]

1:27:31.750 --> 1:27:32.833
Okay.

1:27:32.916 --> 1:27:34.125
[clears throat]

1:27:34.208 --> 1:27:35.416
[line disconnects]

1:27:37.833 --> 1:27:39.791
I hate talking to my kids on the phone.

1:27:40.708 --> 1:27:41.625
What?

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.500
[whispers] I hate talking
to my kids on the phone.

1:27:48.500 --> 1:27:50.541
-They don't like it either.
-Don't say that.

1:27:50.625 --> 1:27:51.583
They don't.

1:27:53.291 --> 1:27:54.375
Don't say that.

1:27:57.875 --> 1:27:58.708
[slaps]

1:27:59.875 --> 1:28:00.833
Okay.

1:28:08.375 --> 1:28:09.625

1:28:12.916 --> 1:28:15.333
[doorbell ringing]

1:28:19.541 --> 1:28:20.458
Hello?

1:28:24.583 --> 1:28:25.541
Hello?

1:28:46.833 --> 1:28:48.916
[foghorn blaring]

1:28:51.125 --> 1:28:52.000
Shit.

1:28:55.250 --> 1:28:57.000
[cell phone ringtone playing]

1:29:02.375 --> 1:29:03.250
Hello?

1:29:04.166 --> 1:29:05.583
Yeah, this is she.

1:29:08.166 --> 1:29:09.750
Oh, is everything okay?

1:29:11.833 --> 1:29:17.041
Uh, yeah, I'm at the last store
by the boats. It sells vintage jewelry.

1:29:18.375 --> 1:29:19.750
I won't move from here.

1:29:28.958 --> 1:29:31.291
I've been following you
for, like, ten minutes.

1:29:31.375 --> 1:29:34.458
-Yeah, you said, is everything okay?
-What? Yeah?

1:29:37.666 --> 1:29:41.250
Your number came up on my phone yesterday.

1:29:42.541 --> 1:29:45.333
-You called me?
-I did. Yeah.

1:29:45.416 --> 1:29:46.416
[Elena] Lady.

1:29:46.500 --> 1:29:49.000
Hey, little one. Are you feeling better?

1:29:49.083 --> 1:29:50.875
She needs her medicine.

1:29:50.958 --> 1:29:53.208
-Your doll, is she sick?
-[Nina] She's not getting over it.

1:29:54.375 --> 1:29:56.875
She wants her doll. Shit.

1:30:00.500 --> 1:30:02.208
-It won't stay on.
-Oh, hey.

1:30:06.333 --> 1:30:07.166
Can I?

1:30:08.750 --> 1:30:11.625
My grandma used to use hat pins.
It won't fall off now.

1:30:13.500 --> 1:30:14.750
Okay. Hat.

1:30:17.666 --> 1:30:18.625
All right?

1:30:20.541 --> 1:30:22.333
-Do it where it's comfy.
-[sighs]

1:30:35.291 --> 1:30:38.125
[Nina] Since the doll went missing,
she's been, like, actually

1:30:38.208 --> 1:30:40.458
driving me fucking crazy.

1:30:41.166 --> 1:30:42.125
I…

1:30:42.750 --> 1:30:45.333
There's something wrong with her.
She's not sleeping.

1:30:46.250 --> 1:30:49.041
At all. She won't sleep
unless I'm in the bed with her.

1:30:49.125 --> 1:30:50.666
And if I move…

1:30:50.750 --> 1:30:53.750
I'm really tired. I'm, like, scary tired.

1:30:53.833 --> 1:30:55.166
Mm, I remember.

1:31:03.583 --> 1:31:05.291
I know you saw me with Will.

1:31:07.416 --> 1:31:08.458
Um…

1:31:10.958 --> 1:31:12.916
I don't want you to think badly of me.

1:31:13.750 --> 1:31:15.291
I don't think badly of anyone.

1:31:16.416 --> 1:31:17.333
Yeah.

1:31:18.208 --> 1:31:21.250
Yeah, uh, see, I knew that.
As soon as I saw you, I just…

1:31:22.083 --> 1:31:24.791
-I was like, "I wanna be like that lady."
-[chuckles]

1:31:28.208 --> 1:31:30.416
[Nina] It didn't mean anything,
what you saw.

1:31:30.500 --> 1:31:31.750
[Leda] Didn't it?

1:31:32.541 --> 1:31:34.166
[Nina scoffing] No.

1:31:35.208 --> 1:31:38.291
I don't let it go anywhere. I just…

1:31:40.666 --> 1:31:42.041
But I'm happy.

1:31:42.875 --> 1:31:45.666
I'm happy with Elena,
with-- with everything.

1:31:45.750 --> 1:31:46.666
I'm…

1:31:49.333 --> 1:31:50.666
I met my husband so young.

1:31:52.375 --> 1:31:54.458
And he's fucking crazy about me.

1:31:55.208 --> 1:31:56.333
And her.

1:31:57.333 --> 1:32:00.458
He says my breasts
are exactly the size of his hand.

1:32:02.416 --> 1:32:04.333
[Leda] What would he do
if he saw you with Will?

1:32:04.833 --> 1:32:06.708
Oh, he'd cut my throat.

1:32:07.458 --> 1:32:08.833
I don't want to talk about him.

1:32:08.916 --> 1:32:12.125
I only have, like, five minutes
before Callie finishes shopping.

1:32:12.208 --> 1:32:13.583
She doesn't want you to talk to me?

1:32:13.666 --> 1:32:15.666
She doesn't want me
to do fucking anything.

1:32:15.750 --> 1:32:17.000
Who gives a fuck?

1:32:22.666 --> 1:32:24.041
Can I ask you something?

1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:25.958
[Leda] Sure.

1:32:28.708 --> 1:32:30.375
What happened in the toy store?

1:32:35.416 --> 1:32:37.708
You were talking
about your daughters and then

1:32:39.208 --> 1:32:40.666
something happened.

1:32:42.250 --> 1:32:43.875
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1:32:44.750 --> 1:32:45.708
Yeah.

1:32:52.125 --> 1:32:53.458
I left.

1:32:57.375 --> 1:32:58.250
Oh.

1:33:00.541 --> 1:33:03.708
When the oldest was seven
and the youngest was five, I left.

1:33:03.791 --> 1:33:04.958
[sobbing softly]

1:33:06.750 --> 1:33:09.291
I abandoned them
and I didn't see them for three years.

1:33:09.375 --> 1:33:11.916
You didn't see your children
for three years?

1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:12.958
No.

1:33:17.083 --> 1:33:18.541
Who took care of them?

1:33:19.416 --> 1:33:22.333
Their father and my mum,
and then I came back for them.

1:33:26.500 --> 1:33:28.666
What did it feel like without them?

1:33:30.625 --> 1:33:32.125
[sobbing]

1:33:32.750 --> 1:33:33.625
[sniffs]

1:33:34.708 --> 1:33:36.125
It felt amazing.

1:33:40.375 --> 1:33:43.541
Felt like I'd been trying not to explode
and then I exploded.

1:33:49.083 --> 1:33:50.541
That doesn't sound amazing.

1:33:51.541 --> 1:33:52.541
Okay.

1:33:58.750 --> 1:34:01.625
-There's Callie and your husband.
-My husband?

1:34:03.583 --> 1:34:04.833
What the fuck is he doing here?

1:34:04.916 --> 1:34:07.083
He's not supposed to be here
until tomorrow.

1:34:08.666 --> 1:34:10.375
Fuck. I have to go.

1:34:19.583 --> 1:34:21.041
[indistinct conversation]

1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:32.083
[grunts]

1:34:43.375 --> 1:34:44.833
[door opening]

1:34:46.291 --> 1:34:49.166
[young Leda gasps] Hi, guys.

1:34:52.250 --> 1:34:53.833
-Hey.
-Hi.

1:34:53.916 --> 1:34:55.416
-Hmm.
-[kisses]

1:34:57.166 --> 1:35:01.083
[Joe chuckling] What are you doing?
Say hello to Mummy.

1:35:01.166 --> 1:35:04.250
Martha. Go on. Go say hello.

1:35:04.791 --> 1:35:06.500
["I Told Jesus" by Roberta Flack playing]

1:35:06.583 --> 1:35:07.625
It's okay.

1:35:10.250 --> 1:35:12.500
-[Leda] Can I get a hug?
-[Joe] Go on.

1:35:13.125 --> 1:35:14.500
-[exclaims]
-Oh!

1:35:14.583 --> 1:35:16.208
[chuckles]

1:35:17.291 --> 1:35:18.541
Mmm.

1:35:19.166 --> 1:35:21.166
Are you home now, Mummy?

1:35:21.250 --> 1:35:22.500
I'm home today.

1:35:23.208 --> 1:35:26.958
Can you wash my hair after dinner?

1:35:27.041 --> 1:35:32.666

1:54:38.750 --> 1:54:41.291
-[Martha] What is that?
-[young Leda] It's called a navel.

1:54:41.375 --> 1:54:43.375
-[Bianca] Why's it called a navel?
-[Martha laughs]

1:54:43.458 --> 1:54:45.125
[young Leda] It's called a navel because…

1:54:45.208 --> 1:54:47.250
-You know another word for navel?
-[Bianca] No.

1:54:47.333 --> 1:54:50.375

-[Martha] Hi, Mama.
-Martha, little one.

1:55:10.458 --> 1:55:13.541
[Bianca] I left you so many messages.
I thought you were dead.

1:55:13.625 --> 1:55:14.708

Are you all right, Mama?

1:55:18.291 --> 1:55:19.625
No, I'm alive actually.

Don't let it break.
