00:04.051 --> 00:06.350
Okay, people, you've got fifteen minutes.

00:06.521 --> 00:10.150
Storm's on its way, and I want to be
on the road before it hits.

00:11.759 --> 00:13.659
How many more rocks do we have to find?

00:13.828 --> 00:18.162
- Two. Rose quartz and meteor rock.
- All right, let's see who can find it first.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.074

00:45.693 --> 00:47.217
Make that one.

00:49.731 --> 00:52.097
You're a regular rock hound, Clark.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.639
Hey, Clark.

01:02.343 --> 01:03.640
Hey, Lana.

01:06.981 --> 01:11.008
When is this whole geological
scavenger hunt over?

01:11.185 --> 01:12.982
Not having much luck?

01:13.821 --> 01:16.415
- Someone's doing more ranting than digging.
- I'm sorry...

01:16.591 --> 01:19.151
...but I find geology
even more pointless than algebra.

01:19.327 --> 01:23.627
I could order these rocks online and have
them delivered to my house, vacuum-sealed.

01:35.176 --> 01:38.270
Hey, Holly, do you want
a piece of meteor rock?

01:38.446 --> 01:41.279
Oh, I've got it checked off already.
Thanks, anyway.

01:41.449 --> 01:43.144
No problem, anytime.

01:44.318 --> 01:47.310
Hey, loser, stop hitting
on my girlfriend, all right?

01:47.488 --> 01:49.922
Next time, I knock your rocks
into the next county.

01:50.091 --> 01:52.559
- Yeah, I'd like to see you try.
- Oh, yeah?

01:53.461 --> 01:55.691
Lucky your daddy's a teacher.

01:56.731 --> 01:58.028
Eric?

01:58.900 --> 02:00.834
How many samples have you collected?

02:01.002 --> 02:04.733
- Just a couple, my glasses keep fogging up.
- Get with the program, Eric.

02:04.906 --> 02:07.841
- But, Dad-
- It's Mr. Summers at school.

02:08.376 --> 02:13.006
You have 10 minutes to complete this
assignment. You'd better find every rock.

02:18.119 --> 02:20.280
Glad he's not my dad.

02:25.827 --> 02:29.763
Has anyone seen Eric?
Apparently he's gotten himself lost.

02:30.631 --> 02:32.223
I'll find him.

03:00.328 --> 03:02.421
Eric! Eric!

04:46.934 --> 04:48.196
Clark!

04:49.270 --> 04:51.568
I could really use your help.

04:52.340 --> 04:54.069
I loaded all the hay, my-

04:54.242 --> 04:55.300
Hey.

04:55.743 --> 04:56.869
You all right?

04:57.044 --> 04:58.568
Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

04:58.746 --> 05:00.771
The truck's stuck
up to its axle in mud and-

05:00.948 --> 05:05.009
- The cows aren't going to feed themselves.
- Yeah. Can you give me a hand, please?

05:09.357 --> 05:11.052
- Ready?
- Ready!

05:16.063 --> 05:17.291
Hang on!

05:21.869 --> 05:22.858
Okay!

05:23.037 --> 05:25.733
- Clark, are you pushing?
- Yeah!

05:31.979 --> 05:33.139
Clark...

05:34.415 --> 05:36.940
Come on, son,
we don't have time to-

05:44.525 --> 05:45.890
What happened?

05:49.297 --> 05:50.855
I don't know.

05:55.636 --> 05:59.037
Here's a clean coat, sweetie,
are you feeling better?

05:59.206 --> 06:02.334
I just don't understand what's wrong
with me. And why am I bleeding?

06:02.510 --> 06:05.911
Maybe it's just a part of
your development, like x-ray vision...

06:06.080 --> 06:09.208
...or maybe the lightning had
something to do with it, I don't know.

06:09.917 --> 06:12.078
I am going to be okay, right?

06:13.888 --> 06:15.753
What you ought to do is go to school...

06:15.923 --> 06:19.620
...and if anything else happens
or it gets worse, give us a call.

06:24.198 --> 06:27.031
You know, it's weird. I never
worried about being sick before.

06:27.201 --> 06:30.466
You're not sick, Clark,
you're just not yourself.

06:30.638 --> 06:33.266
Oh, you just missed your bus,
you'd better hurry.

06:42.049 --> 06:44.916
- Something wrong?
- My speed's gone too.

07:03.537 --> 07:04.526
Morning, Mom.

07:05.206 --> 07:08.300
- Morning, Dad.
- You're late, and I can't wait for you.

07:10.611 --> 07:13.102
Just give him five minutes,
what's the hurry?

07:13.280 --> 07:14.907
I have a faculty meeting.

07:15.082 --> 07:16.208
Fine.

07:16.384 --> 07:18.352
I'll take you
when you're ready to go.

07:21.422 --> 07:22.753
Thanks.

07:23.457 --> 07:26.893
- Mr. Summers.
- Don't you take that tone with me.

07:28.295 --> 07:31.389
Your little stunt yesterday
almost cost a fellow student his life.

07:31.565 --> 07:36.002
- I can only apologize so many times.
- It was stupid and selfish.

07:36.170 --> 07:38.604
Why don't you save the speeches
for your classroom?

07:42.109 --> 07:45.272
- How did you do that?
- You're the science teacher, figure it out.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.877
Get a ride with your mother.

07:57.024 --> 07:58.582
You feeling okay?

07:59.427 --> 08:00.519
Yeah, why?

08:00.694 --> 08:04.562
Usually you run without breaking a sweat.
Today you look like you're about to die.

08:04.732 --> 08:06.256
No, I'm fine.

08:07.601 --> 08:10.092
- What's wrong?
- My leg, it hurts.

08:10.271 --> 08:12.739
It's a cramp, walk it off.

08:16.277 --> 08:18.575
You're falling apart today, Clark.

08:24.785 --> 08:25.945
Eric.

08:26.353 --> 08:27.615
Hey, you got a minute?

08:27.788 --> 08:29.915
Yeah, sure. What's up?

08:30.691 --> 08:34.320
We really didn't get a chance to talk
after what happened yesterday.

08:35.095 --> 08:38.188
Yeah, thanks for grabbing me.
That was a stupid move on my part.

08:39.567 --> 08:41.432
So you feeling all right?

08:43.169 --> 08:44.831
Actually, I feel great.

08:45.005 --> 08:47.030
But there's nothing different about you?

08:47.208 --> 08:49.005
Why, should there be?

08:49.176 --> 08:52.373
No, I'm just glad you're okay.

08:53.948 --> 08:55.472
Clark...

08:55.649 --> 08:57.344
...your nose is bleeding.

09:40.427 --> 09:42.895
- Thanks for the ride.
- You're welcome.

09:44.298 --> 09:47.199
- Wanna come in to say hi to Nell?
- I can't.

09:47.368 --> 09:50.201
I've gotta get over to the store.
Stock day.

09:50.371 --> 09:51.895
See you tonight?

09:52.840 --> 09:55.502
I've gotta run the numbers
over to my dad at the hospital.

09:55.676 --> 09:59.237
- I thought he was supposed to be recovering.
- He is, he's just...

09:59.413 --> 10:01.677
He needs to feel like he's in control.

10:01.849 --> 10:03.749
How are you doing?

10:05.052 --> 10:06.041
Not that great.

10:06.220 --> 10:09.451
Can't get my homework done, I can't train.

10:09.623 --> 10:12.251
Might as well kiss my scholarship goodbye.

10:13.294 --> 10:15.785
Come over tonight, I'll help you
with your homework.

10:21.468 --> 10:24.733
Hey, when did Nell
put the shop up for sale?

10:24.905 --> 10:26.497
What?

10:28.876 --> 10:31.106
Why didn't you tell me
you were selling the shop?

10:31.278 --> 10:33.508
I'm sorry, I only made
the decision this morning.

10:33.681 --> 10:37.583
- When were you planning on telling me?
- I don't understand why you're so upset.

10:37.751 --> 10:40.777
I mean, you've never shown
any interest in this store before.

10:40.955 --> 10:43.116
And now I'm supposed to consult you?

10:44.258 --> 10:48.160
- Are you selling the movie theater as well?
- Yes, Lana, it's part of the building.

10:48.829 --> 10:50.592
You know how much it means to me.

10:50.764 --> 10:53.289
If I'd made business decisions
based on sentiment...

10:53.467 --> 10:56.231
...I would have gone bust a long time ago.

10:56.570 --> 10:59.130
Besides, the movie theater's
been closed for months now.

10:59.306 --> 11:01.831
I'll sell the building
and relocate to a smaller store.

11:02.009 --> 11:06.105
- There has to be another way.
- Look, I'm just thinking of our future.

11:13.220 --> 11:14.881
Finished with the hay.

11:15.055 --> 11:16.317
How you holding up?

11:16.490 --> 11:20.085
Considering my chores used to take five
minutes and now they take two hours...

11:20.260 --> 11:21.249
...I'm all right.

11:21.428 --> 11:25.797
Well, as long as you don't get any worse,
I guess we can count our blessings.

11:25.966 --> 11:27.991
I'd better get to that fence before dinner.

11:28.168 --> 11:30.728
You need your rest.
I'll take care of it in the morning.

11:30.904 --> 11:34.203
- Oh, Dad, I can do it.
- All right, but just remember something.

11:34.375 --> 11:38.539
It took 12 years to get used to your abilities.
Nobody expects you to adjust in 24 hours.

11:38.712 --> 11:39.736
Get the gate.

11:39.913 --> 11:41.210
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah.

11:41.382 --> 11:43.680
How do you find the strength
to do this every day?

11:44.118 --> 11:45.608
Years of practice.

11:49.657 --> 11:51.522
This is very good work, Roger.

11:51.692 --> 11:55.219
All the physical evidence
points to this explanation.

11:55.396 --> 11:59.162
I'm sure you consulted a rogue's gallery
of qualified professionals.

11:59.333 --> 12:02.029
A journalist never reveals his sources.

12:02.202 --> 12:04.693
<i>You work for the Inquisitor, not the Planet.</i>

12:04.872 --> 12:08.774
I want to verify these experts myself.
I'll give you 10 grand a name.

12:08.942 --> 12:10.409
Done.

12:11.612 --> 12:13.910
This will make one hell of a story.

12:14.081 --> 12:16.413
Nobody's ever going to know about this.

12:16.583 --> 12:19.848
And if this story is accidentally leaked...

12:20.020 --> 12:22.511
...you and I are going to have
a serious trust issue.

12:22.690 --> 12:27.286
As opposed to the close,
personal relationship we enjoy now.

13:00.060 --> 13:02.221
Lex, what brings you all the way out here?

13:02.396 --> 13:04.125
I needed to talk.

13:04.298 --> 13:07.358
- You have a minute?
- If you wanna help me with this fence.

13:10.104 --> 13:11.628
You can't lift that by yourself?

13:11.805 --> 13:15.969
Look, I've been baling hay for the last
two hours, I can barely lift my own arms.

13:20.581 --> 13:22.014
So, what's up?

13:23.083 --> 13:24.710
We're friends, right?

13:25.953 --> 13:28.751
Yeah, last time I checked. Why?

13:30.457 --> 13:34.655
I want you to tell me what really happened
the day my car went off that bridge.

13:36.997 --> 13:39.522
I dove in and I pulled you out.

13:40.467 --> 13:44.130
- And that's it?
- Lex, seriously, what's wrong?

13:44.304 --> 13:48.172
I don't think you're being completely honest,
and I think I know why.

13:49.209 --> 13:52.838
All right, well, then,
you tell me what happened.

13:53.814 --> 13:56.612
I think I hit you at 60 miles an hour...

13:57.885 --> 14:02.652
...then you ripped open my roof,
pulled me out and saved my life.

14:03.957 --> 14:06.926
You're the closest I've had
to a real friend my whole life.

14:07.094 --> 14:11.497
- You don't have to hide anything from me.
- You think I'm hiding something from you?

14:13.867 --> 14:15.334
Okay, here.

14:15.502 --> 14:18.096
Take this hammer. Hit me anywhere.

14:18.906 --> 14:20.965
- I'm not going to hit you, Clark.
- Come on!

14:21.141 --> 14:24.338
- If I can get hit by a car, you can't hurt me.
- I just want the truth.

14:24.511 --> 14:27.537
The truth is, I'm just a guy
who tried to do the right thing!

14:27.714 --> 14:29.841
Isn't that enough?

15:04.585 --> 15:07.952
Apparently, Clark is still doing his chores
and that's why he blew us off.

15:08.121 --> 15:09.679
He's been acting weird lately.

15:09.857 --> 15:12.189
Well, Clark's always acting weird.
Give me a gauge.

15:12.359 --> 15:15.385
He was so tired in math class today,
he face-planted on his desk.

15:15.562 --> 15:17.826
I have two words for him: Power Bar.

15:26.707 --> 15:28.140
Give me my laptop!

15:32.713 --> 15:35.204
- Give it back.
- Get out of my way, kid.

15:52.799 --> 15:56.633
- Did you see that?
- Yeah. Unbelievable.

16:02.276 --> 16:04.744
Thank you. That was amazing.

16:05.345 --> 16:06.835
Any time.

16:15.956 --> 16:17.947
Guess we know what happened
to your powers.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.286
Must have been the lightning strike.

16:20.460 --> 16:23.258
You said that Eric was holding a meteor rock.

16:23.430 --> 16:26.160
It must have transferred
your powers somehow.

16:27.267 --> 16:29.428
You know, all those years of hiding...

16:29.603 --> 16:31.298
...I wonder if it was worth it.

16:31.772 --> 16:33.831
Everyone's fine with Eric.

16:34.741 --> 16:36.936
Well, that's just for now, Clark.

16:38.545 --> 16:41.776
Well, the question is whether
it's temporary or permanent.

16:44.184 --> 16:48.018
You know what they say: Lightning
never strikes twice in the same place.

16:52.159 --> 16:53.626
Look...

16:54.294 --> 16:57.730
My guess is that your powers
aren't coming back.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.464
Maybe being normal won't be so bad.

17:03.370 --> 17:06.635
- I mean, it works for you and Mom.
- Oh, thanks.

17:10.210 --> 17:13.008
You don't feel any differently
about me now, do you?

17:13.747 --> 17:15.112
Clark...

17:17.217 --> 17:22.553
You're our son, whether you can
bench-press the tractor or not.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.425
What do I do now?

17:28.929 --> 17:31.898
Well, life isn't easy for anybody...

17:32.065 --> 17:36.331
...whether you're normal or super,
but you're still Clark Kent.

17:36.503 --> 17:40.371
And you were raised a certain way
and that's never gonna change.

17:41.074 --> 17:44.202
Sure, your abilities were a part of you,
but they didn't define you.

17:44.378 --> 17:49.077
Look on the bright side, Clark.
You don't have to hide anymore.

17:49.249 --> 17:52.047
Try to have some fun.

18:01.328 --> 18:04.092
You're kind of relieved, aren't you?

18:04.264 --> 18:08.394
Well, he always said he wanted to be normal.
Guess he got his wish.

18:10.370 --> 18:12.770
You should have seen it.
Eric threw the guy 30 feet.

18:12.906 --> 18:14.806
And not only did he recover my laptop...

18:14.941 --> 18:17.341
<i>...but I got my first byline
in the Smallville Ledger.</i>

18:17.477 --> 18:18.466
That's great, Chloe.

18:18.645 --> 18:21.443
Come on, Clark, how can
you be so blase about this?

18:21.615 --> 18:24.607
The guy stopped a purse-snatcher.
It's not that big a deal.

18:25.552 --> 18:29.113
Hey, thanks for getting
that story in the paper.

18:29.289 --> 18:32.315
Thanks for saving my computer, it's my life.

18:32.492 --> 18:35.518
Okay, how pathetic did that just sound?

18:36.129 --> 18:39.121
- So who came up with "Superboy"?
- I did.

18:39.666 --> 18:40.894
Really?

18:41.701 --> 18:43.896
- I like that.
- Thanks.

18:47.908 --> 18:50.706
- I thought it was kind of lame.
- I don't remember asking you.

18:50.877 --> 18:52.435
Clark's just jealous.

18:52.612 --> 18:55.979
I hope all this attention doesn't
go to his head. He needs to be careful.

18:56.149 --> 18:58.515
You know what?
Start throwing people 30 feet...

18:58.652 --> 19:00.847
...and I'll write nice things about you too.

19:00.987 --> 19:02.750
"Love from Superboy."

19:03.590 --> 19:05.956
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

19:11.731 --> 19:13.596
Clark, are you okay?

19:14.501 --> 19:15.968
I'm great.

19:16.536 --> 19:18.834
I'm getting a pickup
game together in the gym.

19:19.005 --> 19:21.439
You and Kent versus me and Brent,
what do you say?

19:21.608 --> 19:23.701
- Clark doesn't really play.
- No, I play.

19:24.344 --> 19:26.403
Great. Bring it on.

19:28.615 --> 19:30.173
Since when do you play?

19:31.151 --> 19:32.584
Since now.

19:34.855 --> 19:36.755
First one to 15 wins.

20:26.740 --> 20:29.538
If you're interested, we play
every Tuesday and Thursday.

20:29.709 --> 20:32.269
- Good game, good game, man.
- Too bad, Clark.

20:33.113 --> 20:36.241
- Why are you grinning? We lost.
- I know. Pretty cool, huh?

20:43.823 --> 20:46.189
Lex, you remember Dad?

20:48.562 --> 20:52.054
Sir Harry? Victoria,
I've been waiting 45 minutes.

20:52.232 --> 20:54.792
Oh. We were closing a deal.

20:54.968 --> 20:57.402
City of Metropolis giving you
the recycling contract?

20:57.571 --> 20:58.765
Lex.

20:59.506 --> 21:01.406
You seem upset.

21:01.575 --> 21:05.773
If this is the respect you show your partners,
I wonder if I made the right decision.

21:05.946 --> 21:08.938
You see, Lex, it doesn't really matter.

21:09.115 --> 21:11.913
The deal is off.

21:12.752 --> 21:15.482
I thought it was your life's ambition
to crush my father.

21:15.655 --> 21:21.594
No, that's your life's ambition.
Mine is to take over LuthorCorp.

21:24.231 --> 21:26.131
How do you plan to do that?

21:26.299 --> 21:29.393
You heard of Cadmus Labs?

21:34.975 --> 21:37.637
- I've been researching them for about a year.
- Well...

21:37.811 --> 21:39.938
...your research has just paid off.

21:40.113 --> 21:42.946
I bought them. An hour ago.

21:43.883 --> 21:47.842
And with the profits you'll reap from their
patents, you'll buy LuthorCorp outright.

21:48.021 --> 21:50.080
Tell your father...

21:51.091 --> 21:53.525
...I said hello. Come on, girl.

22:01.735 --> 22:03.600
Congratulations.

22:05.772 --> 22:08.172
I hope it was worth it.

22:26.693 --> 22:30.254
Tried to score the last box of jujubes
before this place is sold?

22:30.430 --> 22:33.524
Those things could probably survive
a nuclear winter.

22:38.104 --> 22:41.631
You must have a thing about
bad sound and stale popcorn.

22:42.976 --> 22:45.035
My parents met here.

22:46.079 --> 22:48.775
My dad worked the concession stand
during college...

22:48.948 --> 22:53.078
<i>...and my mom came to see
Close Encounters. She got bored.</i>

22:54.421 --> 22:56.582
<i>How do you get bored
watching Close Encounters?</i>

22:56.756 --> 23:01.386
I don't know.
Maybe she had a thing against aliens.

23:02.162 --> 23:07.099
She hung out in the lobby and spent
the entire night talking to my dad.

23:07.267 --> 23:10.828
They'd only been a few years apart in school
but never noticed each other.

23:10.970 --> 23:14.428
That night, they just clicked.

23:14.974 --> 23:17.306
I know it sounds kind of crazy...

23:17.477 --> 23:23.245
...but I feel that whatever tangible evidence
I have of my parents' existence...

23:23.416 --> 23:25.941
...is slowly being chipped away.

23:27.987 --> 23:31.514
Sometimes letting go
is the only way to move forward.

23:32.892 --> 23:34.484
I guess you're right.

23:35.895 --> 23:38.796
Besides, there's nothing I can do to stop it.

23:42.369 --> 23:44.269
How'd you find me anyway?

23:44.437 --> 23:47.668
Nell told me. I was wondering
if I could borrow your English notes.

23:47.841 --> 23:49.968
I kind of dozed off in class.

23:50.143 --> 23:51.940
Sure.

23:57.917 --> 23:59.908
Have you been feeling okay lately?

24:00.820 --> 24:02.481
Yeah, great, why?

24:02.655 --> 24:07.490
Nothing, you're just less Clark Kent-like.

24:08.728 --> 24:10.093
It's kind of nice.

24:10.263 --> 24:14.666
You seem more relaxed, like you haven't got
the weight of the world on your shoulders.

24:15.568 --> 24:18.765
Well, I guess I woke up
and realized my life had changed.

24:18.938 --> 24:23.068
I decided to kick back and accept
the fact I couldn't control everything.

24:24.811 --> 24:28.338
Maybe I should adopt
that philosophy myself.

24:31.050 --> 24:32.108
Mom!

24:33.620 --> 24:35.451
Hey, have you seen the paper?

24:35.622 --> 24:38.557
People have been calling all day.
It's wonderful, dear.

24:38.725 --> 24:40.989
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

24:44.264 --> 24:46.755
- Are you afraid of me?
- Eric.

24:47.600 --> 24:51.036
We're just a little concerned about
this new-found strength you have.

24:51.204 --> 24:53.263
Where'd it come from?

24:53.907 --> 24:55.431
It must have been the lightning.

24:55.608 --> 25:00.136
- I've set up an appointment with Dr. Litvak.
- Dad, I'm not sick.

25:00.547 --> 25:01.536
I'm special.

25:01.714 --> 25:05.514
Once you get a clean bill of health,
we'll take you to Metropolis.

25:08.488 --> 25:10.285
Well, what are we gonna do there?

25:10.457 --> 25:13.324
I've got an old colleague who's
a professor at the university.

25:13.493 --> 25:16.121
- He wants to meet you.
- Don't you mean study me?

25:17.063 --> 25:20.464
I'm not one of your damn
science experiments, Dad!

25:21.100 --> 25:23.933
This is about you, Dad,
it's always about you!

25:24.537 --> 25:26.334
Even with this, it's still not enough!

25:26.506 --> 25:30.806
You might be special, but you still live
under my roof and you will do as I say.

25:31.878 --> 25:35.541
I am not a freak
and I am not going anywhere!

25:35.715 --> 25:37.945
Eric, put me down.

25:38.117 --> 25:40.711
What are you gonna do, Dad,
ground me, huh?

25:40.887 --> 25:44.152
I never have to listen to you ever again.

25:45.058 --> 25:48.824
I can do whatever I want
and have whoever I want...

25:48.995 --> 25:51.486
...and no one can stop me.

26:10.383 --> 26:14.843
- Hey. You want to go out sometime?
- What do you think you're doing, Summers?

26:15.021 --> 26:17.012
I'm asking Holly out.

26:18.091 --> 26:21.857
Are you suicidal? You're not going out
with my girlfriend, all right?

26:22.028 --> 26:23.052
- Watch me.
- Hey!

26:23.229 --> 26:26.721
You make the cover of the paper with
some stunt, suddenly you're somebody?

26:26.900 --> 26:28.959
- Brent.
- Face it, Summers.

26:29.135 --> 26:30.830
You're still nothing.

26:35.208 --> 26:37.642
All right, man. Don't do it.

26:47.987 --> 26:50.922
What's the problem, Brent?
Why are you hiding from nothing?

27:14.080 --> 27:16.014
Eric, you can't do this!

27:16.182 --> 27:17.615
- Watch me.
- No, I'm serious.

27:17.784 --> 27:22.016
You could kill someone. You don't want
that on your conscience. Just calm down.

27:22.188 --> 27:26.147
You're not my father, Clark.
Now shut up and get out of my way!

27:32.532 --> 27:35.023
Get away from us, you freak!

27:49.749 --> 27:51.341
Just a little higher.

27:51.751 --> 27:53.446
How much longer is it gonna hurt?

27:53.620 --> 27:56.111
- You'll be fine in a couple of weeks.
- A couple weeks?

27:56.289 --> 27:58.416
What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.

27:59.926 --> 28:01.257
Clark!

28:01.995 --> 28:04.361
- Easy on the ribs, Mom.
- How's he doing, doc?

28:04.530 --> 28:08.193
Well, nothing seems to be broken.
We could get an x-ray just to be safe.

28:08.368 --> 28:10.700
I think we'll just take him on home.

28:10.870 --> 28:13.668
It's your choice, but I wanna
see him back in a week.

28:13.840 --> 28:14.864
Thanks, doc.

28:15.041 --> 28:18.238
You help him get dressed,
and I'll go take care of the paperwork.

28:18.845 --> 28:20.335
What happened?

28:20.747 --> 28:23.272
Eric just flipped out,
it was kind of scary.

28:23.449 --> 28:26.475
- I wish you hadn't gotten in his way.
- I don't know what it is.

28:26.653 --> 28:30.555
Even though Eric has my abilities,
I still think of them as my responsibility.

28:30.990 --> 28:32.958
Clark, I just heard.

28:33.126 --> 28:36.254
Hi, Lex.
I'll go see your dad. See you.

28:36.929 --> 28:39.227
So did you come by to make sure I was hurt?

28:39.399 --> 28:41.594
I wanted to make sure you were all right.

28:41.768 --> 28:42.757
Yeah, never better.

28:42.935 --> 28:45.699
We can go out in the parking lot.
You can hit me with your car.

28:45.872 --> 28:46.896
Clark.

28:47.073 --> 28:50.600
What I said about you the other day,
I'm sorry.

28:51.244 --> 28:53.303
Nothing appears to be what it seems lately.

28:53.479 --> 28:56.209
You gonna stop snooping
around my back now?

28:56.683 --> 28:59.243
Listen. I had no right
to question your honesty.

28:59.419 --> 29:02.252
All I can do is plead temporary insanity...

29:02.422 --> 29:05.152
...and hope we can find a way
to put this behind us.

29:06.693 --> 29:08.354
Only temporary?

29:11.497 --> 29:13.658
You need some help?

29:18.705 --> 29:21.105
Yes, thank you.

29:23.743 --> 29:26.473
Eric. Where have you been?

29:26.646 --> 29:28.307
I really messed up.
I need your help.

29:28.481 --> 29:31.279
Your father spoke with Principal Kwan.
We know what happened.

29:31.451 --> 29:33.442
No, Mom, it was an accident.

29:33.619 --> 29:37.146
- Mom, don't be afraid of me!
- Stay away from her, Eric.

29:37.824 --> 29:38.950
What are you doing, Dad?

29:39.125 --> 29:43.459
I told you that some day, you'd have to
take responsibility for your actions.

29:43.629 --> 29:45.597
Well, that day has come.

29:52.672 --> 29:55.072
- What did you do?
- Eric, you need help.

29:55.241 --> 29:57.209
So you called the police?

29:57.877 --> 30:00.744
You're my dad.
You're supposed to protect me.

30:08.821 --> 30:11.016
I stopped by to see
Eric's parents this morning.

30:11.190 --> 30:13.454
- How are they?
- They're scared, Clark.

30:16.896 --> 30:19.091
Were you ever scared of me?

30:21.200 --> 30:22.565
Well...

30:23.569 --> 30:26.333
...you threw a few temper tantrums
when you were little...

30:26.506 --> 30:28.838
...we had some holes in the walls...

30:29.475 --> 30:31.204
...but, no.

30:32.779 --> 30:36.271
- You were a good kid, Clark.
- I don't think Eric's a bad kid.

30:36.449 --> 30:40.852
Neither do I, he's just a teenager
who's in way over his head, that's all.

30:43.055 --> 30:46.252
You know, when this first happened,
I was kind of freaked out...

30:46.793 --> 30:48.693
...but now I'm kind of enjoying it.

30:49.395 --> 30:53.456
I played basketball for the first time
without worrying if I'd hurt anyone.

30:53.633 --> 30:58.263
I can be around Lana
without her necklace making me feel sick.

30:58.437 --> 31:02.066
Even this is better than being around
the meteor rocks, any day of the week.

31:02.241 --> 31:06.143
Something happened at Eric's house. The
police came, but they couldn't control him.

31:06.312 --> 31:08.746
- I have to stop him.
- You're hurt, remember?

31:08.915 --> 31:11.179
If you try to face him again,
he could kill you.

31:11.350 --> 31:14.842
He has my strength.
Maybe he has my weakness too.

31:15.021 --> 31:17.114
The meteor rocks?

31:17.290 --> 31:19.758
No one else knows how to stop him.

31:19.926 --> 31:23.555
Mom, this is who I am,
whether I have my powers or not.

31:24.764 --> 31:28.325
Clark, what about a meteor rock?
It's not like we keep them laying around.

31:30.970 --> 31:32.767
I know where to find one.

31:41.047 --> 31:43.607
I got an urgent call you wanted to see me?

31:44.450 --> 31:46.918
- How'd you do it, Lex?
- Do what?

31:47.086 --> 31:51.284
- Cadmus Labs. It's worthless.
- I know.

31:51.457 --> 31:54.915
Maybe you should have done your homework
before acquiring it so recklessly.

31:55.094 --> 31:58.495
Now you've left yourself open
for a hostile takeover.

31:59.065 --> 32:00.191
I read the report!

32:00.366 --> 32:02.960
You mean that piece of fiction
you stole off my computer?

32:03.135 --> 32:05.831
Is this your idea of having it covered?

32:09.909 --> 32:11.968
That's what you get for trusting family.

32:12.144 --> 32:16.171
My father and I will be making an offer
on your company in the morning.

32:16.649 --> 32:19.117
I'll tell him you said hello.

32:24.090 --> 32:27.287
- How could you do this to me, Lex?
- You did it to yourself, Victoria.

32:27.460 --> 32:30.293
You thought you could make bones
with Daddy by taking me down.

32:30.463 --> 32:34.365
- It was just business.
- You call sleeping with me business?

32:34.533 --> 32:36.865
I'd hate to think what that makes you.

32:41.040 --> 32:45.875
- We could have been great together.
- I plan on being great all by myself.

32:46.045 --> 32:49.208
You'd better check on your dad,
he didn't look well.

32:59.558 --> 33:03.824
I was driving by, I saw the light on.
I figured it was you.

33:05.531 --> 33:06.555
Are you okay?

33:06.732 --> 33:09.724
I called the house earlier,
but your mom said you were asleep.

33:09.902 --> 33:13.065
- I was really scared.
- I'm sorry.

33:14.073 --> 33:16.940
How do you think Eric
got that strong overnight?

33:18.110 --> 33:19.168
I have no idea.

33:19.345 --> 33:22.872
Can you imagine waking up
one morning and having powers?

33:23.416 --> 33:25.111
It's scary.

33:28.187 --> 33:31.748
I guess. I mean, look at Eric,
it hasn't helped him.

33:31.924 --> 33:33.516
That's true.

33:34.293 --> 33:36.454
But I've still always wished I could fly.

33:36.629 --> 33:38.995
Yeah, that'd be something, Lana.

33:43.569 --> 33:44.866
What is it?

33:47.006 --> 33:48.940
It's your necklace.

33:49.442 --> 33:53.310
I never realized
how beautiful it was until now.

33:54.213 --> 33:56.511
This is gonna sound really strange.

33:57.984 --> 33:59.747
Could I borrow it?

34:01.020 --> 34:02.487
Sure.

34:11.130 --> 34:13.121
What do you need it for?

34:13.599 --> 34:15.429
It's complicated.

34:15.601 --> 34:19.059
Whatever happens to me,
I promise you'll get this back.

34:20.406 --> 34:24.467
You're scaring me again.
What is going on?

34:31.851 --> 34:33.978
Goodbye, Lana.

35:10.556 --> 35:13.354
- Clark, what are you doing here?
- I was worried about Eric.

35:13.526 --> 35:16.086
It's a police problem now.
Damn kid's out of control.

35:16.262 --> 35:17.820
Look what he's done to the house.

35:19.098 --> 35:21.191
Do you have any idea where he went?

35:22.768 --> 35:25.601
He talked about getting rid of it.

35:25.771 --> 35:28.501
Said that there was only
one place he could do that...

35:28.674 --> 35:31.040
...whatever that means.

35:43.489 --> 35:44.683
Eric!

35:44.857 --> 35:46.017
Eric!

35:51.297 --> 35:52.423
Eric, don't!

36:03.109 --> 36:04.770
Eric!

36:07.480 --> 36:09.812
You should have let me go
the first time, Clark.

36:10.583 --> 36:14.417
- Would have been better than living like this.
- Eric, why'd you jump off that dam?

36:14.587 --> 36:18.921
I was testing myself to see if I had
any limits. Apparently, I don't.

36:19.959 --> 36:24.055
Look, you can adjust to these abilities.
You've gotta give yourself some time.

36:25.197 --> 36:27.188
How do you know, Clark?

36:28.200 --> 36:30.498
I'm just saying give yourself some time.

36:30.669 --> 36:34.605
Oh, so in time, my parents
won't be scared of me.

36:35.574 --> 36:38.441
The girl of my dreams
won't think I'm a freak.

36:39.011 --> 36:41.343
- The cops won't be after me.
- I can help!

36:41.514 --> 36:43.277
I don't want your help, Clark.

36:52.491 --> 36:55.756
Treat me like a criminal. I'll give
them something to be scared about.

36:55.928 --> 36:57.225
It's not the answer.

36:58.697 --> 37:00.289
Come on, Clark.

37:00.466 --> 37:02.627
If you had this power, what would you do?

37:02.801 --> 37:06.100
- I'd stop people like you.
- Nothing on this earth can stop me.

37:16.982 --> 37:18.506
You're wrong.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.519
We'll see about that.

37:50.549 --> 37:51.811
Eric.

37:53.319 --> 37:55.116
I'm so cold.

37:56.956 --> 37:58.651
So cold.

38:09.602 --> 38:11.797
What do you think is
gonna happen to them now?

38:11.971 --> 38:13.370
Not sure.

38:14.607 --> 38:18.703
Hey. They had problems
long before he had your abilities.

38:19.311 --> 38:20.471
How are you feeling?

38:21.247 --> 38:24.182
- Normal, for me.
- Clark.

38:25.784 --> 38:29.242
Your gifts are, well, they're a part of you,
but they don't define you.

38:30.089 --> 38:31.613
I know.

38:32.157 --> 38:34.216
But they complicate all of our lives.

38:34.994 --> 38:37.394
Seeing how destructive Eric got...

38:38.564 --> 38:42.000
That just reminds me
of how special you really are.

38:45.504 --> 38:48.667
That's because Eric didn't get
my two strongest gifts.

38:50.309 --> 38:52.004
You and Mom.

38:57.316 --> 38:58.578
Let's go home.

38:59.151 --> 39:01.779
Hello, Dad, how's business?

39:02.288 --> 39:06.156
<i>Tomorrow's Planet is announcing
our takeover of Sir Harry's company.</i>

39:07.026 --> 39:09.961
<i>- Did I merit a mention?
- Third paragraph.</i>

39:10.829 --> 39:13.627
<i>That's what happens
when you trust your family, Lex.</i>

39:14.233 --> 39:15.461
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

39:16.035 --> 39:19.903
Thanks, Dad. That means
a lot coming from you.

39:22.608 --> 39:25.941
Your so-called experts
were wrong about Clark Kent.

39:26.645 --> 39:28.977
I saw it with my own eyes.
He's just a regular kid.

39:29.148 --> 39:30.274
That's not possible.

39:32.184 --> 39:35.449
- So how do you explain the accident?
- I can't...

39:35.621 --> 39:38.021
...but I'm closing the book
and putting it behind me.

39:38.190 --> 39:40.317
- There's something there, Lex.
- I don't care.

39:40.492 --> 39:43.757
The Kents are off-limits, understand?

39:45.998 --> 39:47.966
You have something for me?

39:59.278 --> 40:01.007
Nice picture quality.

40:02.147 --> 40:05.947
- Who initiated this little encounter?
- Who do you think?

40:06.585 --> 40:09.816
- Victoria?
- Your father.

40:32.311 --> 40:34.802
Hey. I was just locking up.

40:36.348 --> 40:38.475
I brought your necklace back.

40:41.420 --> 40:44.719
This is beautiful. Where'd you get it?

40:46.024 --> 40:47.286
A friend.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.860
It's made of lead armor.

40:51.997 --> 40:53.658
I want you to have it.

40:53.832 --> 40:56.494
I figure, that way
it can protect your memories.

41:06.178 --> 41:09.079
Is this your way of telling me
I shouldn't wear my necklace?

41:10.015 --> 41:12.347
I don't want it to hold you back.

41:15.788 --> 41:19.053
Sometimes letting go
is the only way to move forward.

41:28.967 --> 41:30.628
You okay?

41:30.803 --> 41:34.603
You look like you've got the weight
of the world on your shoulders again.

41:34.773 --> 41:36.468
Yeah, I guess I do.

41:38.744 --> 41:40.336
Can I walk you home?

41:41.313 --> 41:44.180
Actually, I'm meeting Whitney at the store.

41:45.684 --> 41:46.776
Rain check?

41:48.954 --> 41:50.444
Rain check.

41:52.825 --> 41:54.349
Good night, Lana.

41:55.327 --> 41:56.726
Good night.
