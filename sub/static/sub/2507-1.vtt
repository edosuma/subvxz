01:03.320 --> 01:06.490
This program was founded
on certain ideals.

01:06.640 --> 01:10.220
They have been drowned by the
noise and distraction of fame.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.860
We got lost, caught up in the hype...

01:13.960 --> 01:16.288
the celebrity, the glory...

01:17.400 --> 01:20.649
and the relentless pressure
to keep the streak alive.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.260
The sophomore goes back to
set up the screen for Tucker.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.420
Tucker got a block. Tucker has space.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.620
- Tucker breaks a tackle.
- What a move!

01:46.720 --> 01:49.020
Forty-five up the middle.
One man to beat.

01:49.120 --> 01:53.260
Throwing one deep down the middle,
going for Jones. Touchdown De La Salle!

01:53.360 --> 01:55.380
Absolutely unbelievable.

01:55.480 --> 01:59.220
The greatest high-school
performance I've seen in 15 years.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.020
De La Salle High has won
three titles in a row.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.740
Their 48th consecutive victory.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.940
To the fans, it's quickly
becoming known as "The Streak."

02:08.039 --> 02:12.140
Tonight, they break a 22-year-old win
record held by a Michigan high school.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.940
Talking about streaks,
there's a lot of pressure...

02:15.040 --> 02:17.260
Coach Lad has done an amazing job.

02:17.360 --> 02:21.087
De La Salle has been winning
for the past 11 years, straight.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.700
Welcome to the 2003 Northern
Conference Sectional Championships...

02:38.800 --> 02:42.820
where powerhouse De La Salle
brings their 150-game win streak...

02:42.920 --> 02:45.964
against their rivals,
the Pirates of Pittsburg High.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.220
- Hey, Bob. Bob.
- Marty, you live under the stadium?

02:50.320 --> 02:52.340
Bob, 25 years coaching this team...

02:52.440 --> 02:56.620
favored to win your 12th championship,
150 wins. How did you pull it off?

02:56.720 --> 02:58.900
Well, winning a lot
of games is doable.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.780
Teaching kids there's
more to life, that's hard.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.740
Come on. You turned this
team into a winning machine.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.500
How long you think you can
keep the streak alive?

03:07.600 --> 03:09.700
The streak was never our goal.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.220
Yeah? Well, then,
why do you keep winning?

03:12.320 --> 03:15.171
This program's a lot of things.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.084
It's not just a football team,
or win-streak machine.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.500
It's a family.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.980
A brotherhood which is based in love.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.900
Put simply...

03:28.000 --> 03:32.808
love means you can count on me,
in good times and in bad.

03:34.240 --> 03:38.820
Ladies and gentlemen, here to play for
their 12th straight championship win...

03:38.920 --> 03:41.771
the De La Salle Spartans.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.140
Go Spartans!

03:44.240 --> 03:47.922
I love this part.
Totally freaks out the other team.

03:48.680 --> 03:52.180
I know I'm not supposed to
say this, let alone think it.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.562
This streak's our legacy.

03:55.080 --> 03:58.540
We will never experience anything
like this again in our lives.

03:58.640 --> 04:01.020
You guys are all my family...

04:01.120 --> 04:04.580
but after tomorrow night,
this will never be like this again.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.660
I'll never forget my time
on this team, or with you.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.060
Spartans for life!

04:09.160 --> 04:10.850
Spartans for life!

04:13.760 --> 04:16.260
Streak, streak, streak!

04:16.360 --> 04:20.849
Terrance Kelly takes the opening kickoff
on the five-yard line. Gets a block.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.580
Terrance Kelly is the best
prospect on the field.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.540
Sees a wedge and shoots up
the middle over the 40.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.763
Brought down on the 49-yard line.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.900
All right, I got Cam's card.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.410
"Training goal: Five extra gassers
after practice every day." Done.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.921
"Practice goal:
Catch every ball." Perfect.

04:40.120 --> 04:43.460
"Game goal: 200 yards receiving,
two touchdowns...

04:43.560 --> 04:46.240
and average 15 yards
after every catch."

04:47.040 --> 04:50.100
Did you hear that? That is
a perfect commitment card.

04:50.200 --> 04:54.780
Big goals that stretch his abilities,
but doable when giving a perfect effort.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.980
- You go get those, Cam.
- Yes, sir.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.727
Gonzales throws a long,
deep ball to Cam Colvin...

05:02.320 --> 05:06.260
who out-jumps the defenders for
De La Salle's first score of the game.

05:06.360 --> 05:09.100
Colvin is a coveted
Division 1 prospect...

05:09.200 --> 05:12.380
who's drawing interest from
top programs in the country.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.380
Not asking you to be perfect every play.
What we're asking of you...

05:16.480 --> 05:19.140
and what you should be
asking of each other...

05:19.240 --> 05:22.364
is to give a perfect effort
from snap to whistle.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.500
Cam Colvin just pitched
the ball back to Kelly.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.300
The most athletic play
I've seen all year.

05:29.400 --> 05:33.460
I got T.K.'s card. "Three extra sets,
cleans, every day after practice."

05:33.560 --> 05:36.730
Blue 18! Set, hut!

05:39.000 --> 05:40.486
Throw the ball!

05:41.360 --> 05:42.721
Yeah, that's it!

05:43.200 --> 05:45.820
- I got Howard's card.
- This is Jimmy's card.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.740
- Nice! Great block.
- "Two hundred fifty push-ups...

05:48.840 --> 05:52.044
- ...after workout."
- "Get to the second level on sweeps."

05:53.120 --> 05:54.260
I have Chris' card.

05:54.360 --> 05:57.900
"Training commitment: Ten extra
tire drags after practice every day.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.900
Game goal: Two running touchdowns."

06:00.000 --> 06:03.380
Their middle linebacker's
gonna be covering you, Chris.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.660
You have way more speed than him.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.860
Gonzales, under center,
takes the snap.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.845
Pitches out to Ryan,
who's got room to run.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.811
Sheds a tackle.

06:16.560 --> 06:20.940
In for the touchdown,
which makes the score 27 to nothing.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.620
So, Mickey, does Chris wanna
break this record as bad as you?

06:24.720 --> 06:28.527
- Yeah, he's getting there.
- Thanks. Good block, good block.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.980
You see number 34? Ryan?

06:33.080 --> 06:35.020
Chris Ryan? Write that name down.

06:35.120 --> 06:38.700
When Cam Colvin and Terrance Kelly
are gone, he's the whole team.

06:38.800 --> 06:42.260
I mention he's gonna break the
state's scoring record next year?

06:42.360 --> 06:46.360
If there's anything anyone wants
to say, now is your shot.

06:47.920 --> 06:52.020
Look, I just wanna say...

06:52.120 --> 06:55.260
in my four years here I
played a lot of games.

06:55.360 --> 06:59.804
But none is more important to me
than tomorrow's. My last game.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.020
I love you, guys.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.005
We always say to
finish strong, right?

07:05.160 --> 07:07.328
Tomorrow I'm playing for Cam's mom...

07:08.160 --> 07:11.220
who loves this team almost
as much as Cam does.

07:11.320 --> 07:12.860
Love you, boy.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.162
Love you too, man.

07:16.640 --> 07:21.482
I know some of you guys already
know this, but most of you don't.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.567
My grandfather has cancer.

07:25.960 --> 07:31.041
He can't come to our practices anymore,
he can't even make the games.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.780
But every day, he waits for me
to get back from practice...

07:34.880 --> 07:37.924
just so I can tell
him how we're doing.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.980
As simple as that sounds...

07:41.080 --> 07:44.443
that's one of the things
that keeps him going.

07:44.880 --> 07:50.041
You know, our progress
keeps him going.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.380
I'm grateful for that.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.740
None of the juniors share
their emotions. Just the seniors.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.540
- I know.
- Second string, you're in.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.340
Coach Bob Ladouceur
is putting in his juniors.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.700
These young men
have big shoes to fill...

08:04.800 --> 08:08.402
if they plan on continuing
this undefeated streak.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.300
Tayshon Lanear missed
an easy block...

08:14.400 --> 08:17.340
- ...Chris Ryan pays the price.
- Let's hit out there!

08:17.440 --> 08:20.340
Yo, Tayshon. If it isn't too
much to ask, pick it up.

08:20.440 --> 08:25.460
- Chill, man. I'll get you on the next play.
- Don't get it right, don't get a next one.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.650
Hey, easy, little Lad.
Your pops is the coach, not you.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.571
Hut!

08:36.559 --> 08:38.842
Go Ryan! Bring it in!

08:42.039 --> 08:44.925
- Chris Ryan with another great run.
- Attaboy, Chris!

08:46.320 --> 08:48.140
- Huh, 34.
- Yeah.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.568
Four, three, two, one!

08:54.800 --> 08:58.800
De La Salle! De La Salle!
De La Salle!

09:04.280 --> 09:07.420
De La Salle pushes their
winning streak to 151 games.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.420
We're number one! We're number one!

09:09.520 --> 09:11.220
De La Salle's streak continues.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.888
We're number one! We're number one!

09:19.960 --> 09:21.844
Streak! Streak! Streak!

09:25.160 --> 09:27.010
Great game, coach.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.940
Half a dozen schools want
us to come for official visits.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.140
- He deserves it, Mr. Kelly.
- Thank you, coach. Great job.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.260
- Hey, T-Gram.
- Great job, Coach Ladouceur.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.289
Hey, this is crazy.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.780
There's my baby.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.801
T-Gram! That's cool.

09:45.640 --> 09:48.380
Get off of me, you big bugger.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.620
- Pops.
- Great job.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.980
- Good stuff. I love you.
- Love you too.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.940
- Hey, coach.
- You're doing it.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.740
You're doing it.
Getting my baby out of Richmond.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.740
- He's a very special young man.
- Thank you.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.980
T-Gram, I'm gonna come see
you every chance I get, right?

10:03.080 --> 10:05.500
I don't want you back
in that Richmond mess.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.290
We coming to see you.

10:13.680 --> 10:17.123
Quitter! Hey.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.886
Hey, boss.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.644
- Morning, coach. Keep the streak alive.
- Morning, Pete. The streak alive, yeah.

10:28.800 --> 10:32.288
Michael, cut it out.
All right? Seriously.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.530
You kidding me?

10:35.040 --> 10:36.700
- I'll break that.
- Guys, guys!

10:36.800 --> 10:40.049
Come here! Give me that horn!
Come back here, you little...

10:40.320 --> 10:43.460
Here he is. Good run?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.410
- Hey, Terry.
- Hey, there he is.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.900
Cal State. What do they want?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.328
It's just a coaching offer.

10:52.600 --> 10:56.900
You're throwing it in the trash?
A job offer. We don't get to talk about it?

10:57.000 --> 11:00.300
College coaching. It's not what I do.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.809
But we should at
least discuss it, Bob.

11:04.760 --> 11:08.362
- Terry.
- Hey, great pancakes.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.540
Wow, okay.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.460
You, Louis Armstrong,
in your room. Practice.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.460
You, million things to do.

11:15.560 --> 11:19.020
Gotta take the tree down.
I've been up since 5. I'm just like...

11:19.120 --> 11:21.340
Make sure your room
is clean, Michael.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.246
You should at least consider it, Bob.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.723
Great pancakes.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.860
He acts like it doesn't
mean anything to him...

11:38.960 --> 11:42.660
but he's got a diary,
just counting down the TDs.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.740
- A diary?
- She's a chronic liar.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.980
- A very, very ill young woman.
- Really?

11:47.080 --> 11:48.540
Did I mention delusional?

11:48.640 --> 11:51.780
- You have a diary.
- It's a playbook. At least my earrings...

11:51.880 --> 11:55.900
- ...aren't bigger than my girlfriend's.
- Sure. Okay. That's mean, but true.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.601
Yo, my fellow Spartans.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.500
I gotta mind my etiquette.

12:01.600 --> 12:06.660
You're officially Captain Chris I'm-Gonna-
Break-the-State-TD-Scoring-Record now.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.380
Well, at least the vote
was based on ability...

12:09.480 --> 12:11.740
not family connections, little Lad.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.060
Like how I'm gonna be starting
wide receiver and not you?

12:15.160 --> 12:18.364
Hey, man. It's cool. We'll see.

12:19.640 --> 12:23.940
Oh, look out. Here comes the luckiest
cornhusker in Contra Costa County.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.420
- Beasie!
- What's up?

12:25.520 --> 12:29.167
- How's it going, fellas?
- Hey, girls.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.540
My big man on the line.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.740
- Gotta bring it for me.
- To the house.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.620
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.620
- I'm gonna go freshen up. Wanna come?
- Yes.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.420
- How much fresher can she get?
- Too fresh for you.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.131
Sassy.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.980
Why do they do that? Go together.

12:49.080 --> 12:52.100
- How did you get with her?
- She asked me out.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.380
- She asked him out.
- Tell me you're jumping all over that.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.842
No, we're... We're waiting.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.500
- They're waiting.
- Yeah.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.820
- For what?
- The big day.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.860
We took a purity pledge.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.500
Son. What's the name of
the cult that you're in?

13:08.600 --> 13:10.325
Pleasant Hill Baptist.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.003
That boy's taken one too
many shots to the head.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.980
Sounds like all the
other college offers.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.340
- A nice house?
- Yeah.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.740
The kids going to college for free?
What was I thinking?

13:25.840 --> 13:29.180
Look, the players are handpicked,
self-motivated, smart...

13:29.280 --> 13:34.020
eyes fixed on their bright futures.
They don't need what I do, Bev.

13:34.120 --> 13:37.340
They don't need a coach who
knows the game inside and out?

13:37.440 --> 13:41.260
Who knows how to teach kids to
become honorable, accountable men...

13:41.360 --> 13:42.740
with self-worth?

13:42.840 --> 13:47.140
Bob, you do it and I've watched you do
it brilliantly since I was 23 years old.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.408
I wouldn't be helping anyone.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.580
I mean, shouldn't it be easier?
Don't you deserve that?

13:54.680 --> 13:56.980
I've seen the schedule
for college coaches.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.060
You think it'd be easier, less grueling?
It would not.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.522
You don't know. How do you know?

14:03.360 --> 14:07.406
I just want you happy and healthy...

14:08.240 --> 14:12.780
and yeah, home every once in a while,
just playing football with your own kids.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.380
Going for a stupid walk
for hot chocolate...

14:15.480 --> 14:18.684
maybe more than, you know,
twice a decade.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.580
You... You're gonna
get your record, bro.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.820
Even if Mickey has to steal it.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.380
Forget about your dad.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.660
You're 37 touchdowns away
from breaking a state record.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.042
All right, it's about you.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.090
Us.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.288
- Our year.
- Our year.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.720
- Hold them high, boys. Hold them high.
- T.K.

14:42.840 --> 14:46.123
- What's up, big guy?
- To your year. Chris, you...

14:47.000 --> 14:52.500
You're captain now. My man Danny
over here, he grew up on the team.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.100
Has all the credit,
he doesn't need a title.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.640
Kind of makes me wonder.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.900
About what?

14:59.000 --> 15:02.180
If it's gonna be your year,
or some other team's year.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.100
- K, we haven't lost a game...
- I know, believe me.

15:05.200 --> 15:09.803
I'm just saying, you guys gotta
open your eyes. You ain't ready.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.540
On skills, you have
half the team we did.

15:12.640 --> 15:16.460
On attitude, most of y'all got big
heads or just wanna wear the jersey.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.780
So you gotta step up.
You gotta become real leaders.

15:19.880 --> 15:24.244
You have to motivate your players to
get their game even tighter than ours.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.804
Next year is on you.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.300
Take care, boys.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.647
- Peace, man.
- Yeah.

15:39.560 --> 15:42.240
It's time to deal with
the De La Salle problem.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.780
Last year, De La Salle
out-scored league opponents...

15:46.880 --> 15:49.500
326 to 27.

15:49.600 --> 15:54.203
Their average score against
league teams was 47 to 4.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.260
How, Bob? How are we supposed
to compete against a program...

15:58.360 --> 16:01.860
that pulls in the best players
with the wave of a scholarship?

16:01.960 --> 16:03.420
For the hundredth time...

16:03.520 --> 16:07.700
De La Salle High's code of conduct
forbids scholarshipping athletes.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.380
Explain to me why the best
wide receiver in my district...

16:11.480 --> 16:14.180
rides a bus for a solid
hour up to De La Salle.

16:14.280 --> 16:17.300
Our program attracts great athletes,
plain and simple.

16:17.400 --> 16:21.980
No matter how you get your players,
you're stacking your team with talent.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.660
- That's not cheating?
- Let me get this straight.

16:24.760 --> 16:27.486
You wanna penalize us for
building a winning program?

16:27.720 --> 16:32.820
I'm done with this! Nobody wins 151
football games straight without cheating.

16:32.920 --> 16:37.045
We will not play
De La Salle next season.

16:41.440 --> 16:45.690
Great. Done.
We don't wanna play you either.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.980
We'll play our five league games...

16:48.080 --> 16:52.580
then we'll fill our open slots with
tougher teams from bigger conferences.

16:52.680 --> 16:56.300
Gee, seems like I heard the 49ers
already have a full schedule.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.045
Who's left?

16:58.800 --> 17:00.331
Long Beach Poly.

17:04.480 --> 17:08.660
Eidson, Poly's the number-one
high-school team in Southern California.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.564
Yeah. Isn't it great?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.420
Poly?

17:12.520 --> 17:15.220
- We talked about this.
- Never said you set it up.

17:15.319 --> 17:18.020
Nationally, we're number one.
They're number two.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.740
They've been trying to
get us on their schedule.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.260
They're not afraid of us.

17:22.359 --> 17:26.380
Guys, can't wait to
see you play Poly.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.806
Good luck.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.082
You can thank me later.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.580
In Luke 6:38...

17:37.680 --> 17:40.611
Luke says, "Give and it
will be given to you.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.420
Good measure, pressed down,
shaken together and running over...

17:44.520 --> 17:46.580
will be poured into your lap...

17:46.680 --> 17:51.647
for with the measure you use,
it will be measured to you."

17:52.160 --> 17:55.762
Any idea what Luke is
saying here? Arturo?

17:57.040 --> 17:58.300
You reap what you sow.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.580
Like, whatever you do, good or bad,
comes back to you.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.020
Anyone else think you
give to others...

18:04.120 --> 18:07.369
and the blessing is
returned in equal measure?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.180
Salinas.

18:09.280 --> 18:12.940
I've worked hard to do the right
thing, and I've been blessed.

18:13.040 --> 18:16.244
- How's that?
- Getting to play on the streak team.

18:16.840 --> 18:20.540
You ain't in line to be starting
quarterback on the streak team...

18:20.640 --> 18:22.900
because you've done the right thing.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.249
It's because you're 6'2"
with a cannon for an arm.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.763
So, Tayshon, what do you believe?

18:29.960 --> 18:34.340
Well, down where I sleep, the dealers
in Richmond make mad money.

18:34.440 --> 18:38.060
My aunt was an ER nurse.
Worked her whole life helping people.

18:38.160 --> 18:41.100
Time came for her to get hers,
they up and fired her...

18:41.200 --> 18:43.880
six months before they
gotta pay her retirement.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.900
Dog-eat-dog. Take what you need.
They don't care how good you've been.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.980
You sitting around waiting for somebody
to pay you back, you going hungry.

18:52.080 --> 18:57.060
So why does a guy like Luke,
who's a doctor, painter, writer, historian...

18:57.160 --> 18:59.727
take the time to invent a lie?

18:59.880 --> 19:01.286
It ain't a lie.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.740
Your pops dies, five-0 puts your
mom on trial for it when, oops...

19:05.840 --> 19:07.980
our bad, the shipyard poisoned him.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.180
Pressure gives her a stroke
and now she ain't got long.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.369
Easy. Everyone knows the story.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.460
So tell me, homey.

19:15.560 --> 19:19.082
You really been that bad to
deserve all that's come your way?

19:20.320 --> 19:21.646
Can I speak to Cam?

19:22.040 --> 19:23.287
Cam.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.380
Yo, Coach Lad.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.250
Yo, Jamal.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.500
Cool, thanks.

19:53.600 --> 19:57.088
Coach. You know how you
like to talk and talk...

19:57.240 --> 19:59.380
- ...and sometimes holler?
- That's right.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.260
And one time,
Cam said you said the S-word.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.700
I remember that time.

20:03.800 --> 20:08.380
Well, here, you gotta be
real quiet. My mom's resting.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.045
Not a peep.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.690
- Hey, coach.
- Cam, look.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.000
Man, that is tight.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.842
Watch Mama, all right?

20:30.680 --> 20:32.928
See, Mama?

20:34.920 --> 20:36.645
How is she?

20:38.400 --> 20:40.250
The nurse say...

20:40.880 --> 20:43.242
it's just a matter of time.

20:44.200 --> 20:48.121
And that's it. That's the
last of my Mohicans.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.928
You have Jamal.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.340
The boy don't know it yet...

20:54.440 --> 20:57.500
but he's going down to San Jose,
stay with my cousin.

20:57.600 --> 21:01.486
They should be good to him,
but ain't got no room for me.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.900
I got nobody left.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.445
Well, family isn't
just blood relatives.

21:10.920 --> 21:14.408
It's anyone who loves
you unconditionally.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.170
"To Coach Lad...

21:22.960 --> 21:26.780
I promise to live the rest of my
days by the lessons you taught me.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.448
'Give and it shall be given to you...

21:30.960 --> 21:35.370
for whatever measure you use, it shall
be measured back to you in equal... "'

21:40.360 --> 21:43.325
Why is this happening to me, coach?

21:44.400 --> 21:46.011
What did I do?

21:46.480 --> 21:47.980
I'm trying.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.860
I'm making my perfect effort.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.845
It don't matter. Ain't enough.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.322
What if Tayshon is right?

21:55.520 --> 21:57.940
Maybe God don't see me,
or he don't care...

21:58.040 --> 22:00.060
because I ain't worth his time.

22:00.160 --> 22:03.204
Don't make no sense, coach.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.540
I'm alone.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.127
I got nobody left.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.660
No, you're not.

22:09.760 --> 22:12.088
You've got Jamal...

22:12.960 --> 22:15.731
me and 60 brothers.

23:26.280 --> 23:30.565
I'm just gonna nap for 10
more minutes, then get up.

23:37.120 --> 23:39.448
Don't snore.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.407
I'm not laughing.

23:49.960 --> 23:52.500
What did I ever see in you? Bob?

23:52.600 --> 23:54.404
Bob? Bob?

23:55.280 --> 23:57.620
Bob, Bob, please. Bob? Bob?

23:57.720 --> 23:59.380
Danny!

23:59.480 --> 24:01.860
Bob, what's going on?
Bob? Oh, my God, Bob!

24:01.960 --> 24:03.740
- Danny!
- Yeah, Mom.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.088
Danny!

24:07.080 --> 24:09.780
- Mom, what's wrong?
- Danny, please call 911!

24:09.880 --> 24:12.162
- Oh, my God! Call 911!
- Mom! Mom!

24:12.400 --> 24:16.580
- Dad? Where is the phone? It's not here.
- Danny, tell them it's a seizure.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.962
- Find the phone!
- Where is it?

24:20.680 --> 24:24.220
Oh, my God. Look at me.
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.

24:24.320 --> 24:27.330
Oh, my God, you okay?
You okay? Breathe.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.569
- Hey, Amani. Thanks for coming.
- Hey, Amani.

24:42.960 --> 24:46.060
- Oh, one for me. Just... Just one second.
- Cool.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.620
Hey. Who's in there?

24:48.720 --> 24:52.845
Currently paying his respects to
the coach, Maurice Jones Drew.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.820
No way.

24:54.920 --> 24:58.420
Coach, make sure I get you tickets
to come see me, all right?

24:58.520 --> 25:00.165
I want 100 from you.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.860
I still can't believe it.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.844
Coach Lad smoking.

25:06.680 --> 25:09.380
- Mrs. Lad. Good seeing you.
- So great to see you.

25:09.480 --> 25:13.740
- Take care of the big guy for me.
- Okay, I will. Thanks for coming, Maurice.

25:13.840 --> 25:16.884
- Hey, you.
- Hey, Dad.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.362
Don't look so tough now, huh?

25:20.200 --> 25:22.220
Mr. Ladouceur.

25:22.320 --> 25:26.889
Eighty-three percent occlusion
in your PLA descending artery.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.300
We call that the widow-maker.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.060
- You're a very lucky man.
- Yeah.

25:32.160 --> 25:35.842
- So, what happens next?
- Recuperation.

25:36.160 --> 25:40.020
Near-term, I'll be happy if you're
in good condition by April.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.560
That's spring practice.

25:42.680 --> 25:43.820
Not for you.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.780
You've got five stents
and one shot to heal.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.020
Stepping onto a field before summer?

25:49.120 --> 25:51.448
Don't even think about it.

25:52.840 --> 25:55.850
Dad, you're gonna coach
me next season, right?

25:56.320 --> 25:58.204
Danny.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.769
Danny.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.820
Hey, Michael...

26:04.920 --> 26:07.060
wanna go harass some more doctors?

26:07.160 --> 26:08.521
Come on.

26:10.800 --> 26:14.482
Danny's just worried about you.
This really scared him.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.451
It's a lie.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.241
What is?

26:21.280 --> 26:25.405
Me. I got caught up in work and the
streak and let it nearly kill me.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.260
I talk character,
honesty, perfection...

26:28.360 --> 26:32.020
commit to each other, your teachers,
your friends, your family.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.100
Was I committed to you?

26:34.200 --> 26:36.700
Was I committed to my children?

26:36.800 --> 26:40.925
I've been a lousy husband
and the worst dad.

26:42.160 --> 26:46.001
Danny's not angry because he isn't
getting the chance to play for you.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.964
He's angry because he wants
a chance to know you.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.847
What do I do now?

26:57.240 --> 27:01.411
Spend as much time with your
family as you do the team.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.648
See you later, babe. Call me tonight.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.620
Hey, T.K. Heads up.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.420
- Over here.
- Who wants it?

27:14.520 --> 27:15.740
- Me.
- All right.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.566
- Me, me, me.
- Right here. Right here.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.300
- What's all this?
- All for you.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.860
This is Coach Little. The rules
say you can't keep any of it yet.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.180
You're getting looks
from other schools.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.580
Peek at what you
look like in our gear.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.620
If I'd have had these,
I'd have been All City.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.060
Newest model from Nike.

27:34.160 --> 27:37.807
Mrs. Kelly, maybe you wanna
open that last bubble package.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.131
Hey, what you got, T-Gram?

27:41.200 --> 27:42.561
Diploma.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.607
- With your name on it.
- What?

27:48.680 --> 27:50.928
What? What?

27:51.480 --> 27:55.580
No matter what, four years from now,
when you have your real diploma...

27:55.680 --> 27:59.660
it will reward you and your
family for the rest of your life.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.820
- Yeah, sure.
- So you've got a lot of offers.

28:02.920 --> 28:06.300
What's it gonna take to get you
to play for Oregon next year?

28:06.400 --> 28:09.001
Say yes.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.660
- Yes.
- Cam Colvin comes with me.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.100
We offered a full ride.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.140
We know his mother passed away,
but haven't heard back.

28:17.240 --> 28:19.727
Done deal. Full ride.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.051
Oh, we did it, man.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.380
Yo, the great black hope.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.940
- Cam here?
- He's in the back.

28:46.040 --> 28:49.210
Y'all come on and get
something to eat now.

29:00.520 --> 29:03.260
- Oh, coz, what's up?
- What's up?

29:03.360 --> 29:07.700
You get a full ride from Oregon and
dodge my calls. That's what's up.

29:07.800 --> 29:11.020
Look, man, I ain't going to
Oregon or any place near you.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.260
I'm going to Miami.

29:12.360 --> 29:13.580
Miami?

29:13.680 --> 29:16.100
- It's best for me.
- Best for you?

29:16.200 --> 29:18.980
Since day one, we've been
doing what's best for us.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.500
You and me, together.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.700
- We were 14.
- We were friends.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.809
Whatever.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.500
Man, get up! I'm talking to you, dog!

29:27.600 --> 29:31.486
Get off me! As smart as you are,
you don't know what you don't know!

29:31.960 --> 29:34.940
You still got Landrin,
T-Gram, you got everybody.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.500
All I got left is Jamal.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.724
I gotta make it to the league
so I can take care of him.

29:40.840 --> 29:44.647
- Cam, I know how hard this has been...
- Don't!

29:45.000 --> 29:48.170
You're just making it harder.
Don't you see?

29:49.200 --> 29:51.289
You see me?

29:52.040 --> 29:54.481
I'm cursed.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.648
Everyone I love...

30:03.920 --> 30:07.169
I can't lose nobody else, man.

30:09.360 --> 30:13.246
T, I gotta let you go, man.

30:24.560 --> 30:27.525
Man, you done lost
a lot of folks, Cam...

30:27.760 --> 30:30.440
but you didn't lose everybody.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.860
- Man, Why'd you bring me this?
- It's proof.

30:50.960 --> 30:54.220
We dreamed about playing
college ball since we was kids.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.660
We prayed for it.

30:55.760 --> 30:58.611
And now here we are, damn near grown.

30:59.440 --> 31:03.140
Cam, what you're holding,
that just ain't a jersey, man.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.329
It's an answered prayer.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.843
Look at me, dog.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.090
You and me.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.367
Brothers for life, dog.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.564
Come on.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.449
Brothers for life.

31:34.680 --> 31:37.460
All right, team, bring it in.
Everyone settle down.

31:37.560 --> 31:41.003
Coach Lad is on his way in to
say a few words. Bring it down.

31:44.160 --> 31:47.020
Alumbaugh's pulling
the team together.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.926
Okay. Good.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.580
I talked to my doctors...

32:04.680 --> 32:09.169
and they don't feel that I should
come back to coaching you.

32:10.880 --> 32:14.140
But rather than drawing
this whole thing out...

32:14.240 --> 32:17.171
I'm just gonna be truthful with you.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.644
I'm not sure when
I'll be able to return.

32:23.360 --> 32:27.645
I expect you seniors to
step up and lead this team.

32:30.520 --> 32:35.260
And I expect you guys to continue
to give a perfect effort...

32:35.360 --> 32:37.369
every game.

32:53.080 --> 32:56.500
Not your typical trumpet number, huh?

32:56.600 --> 32:58.848
No, not typical.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.460
Getting the hang of it?

33:01.560 --> 33:04.650
- Me or Michael?
- You.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.568
Anything else I can help you with?

33:10.200 --> 33:13.140
No. Think you're doing great.

33:13.240 --> 33:16.330
Just remember, I like mine rare.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.004
You got it.

33:31.120 --> 33:35.006
- You want the other half of this?
- Yeah, sure.

33:40.240 --> 33:45.082
I've dropped more passes this summer
than the previous three years combined.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.140
You're not seeing the
ball into your hands.

33:51.240 --> 33:55.001
- You're looking up-field before you catch.
- I know.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.727
I try to stop, but...

33:59.000 --> 34:00.281
What should I do?

34:01.440 --> 34:04.007
You gotta work on that
with Coach Alumbaugh.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.660
I don't need Coach Alumbaugh.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.007
I need you.

34:10.239 --> 34:12.980
My senior season is here, Dad.
My last shot.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.340
Danny, I'm not your coach.

34:15.440 --> 34:18.460
But I wanna spend some
time together, get closer.

34:18.560 --> 34:21.380
- I found a river-rafting outfit...
- River rafting?

34:21.480 --> 34:24.420
Afterwards, we'll win the
father-son three-legged race.

34:24.520 --> 34:28.179
This is perfect. The whole time
I needed a father, I got a coach.

34:28.280 --> 34:32.201
And now I need a coach and
all I've got is a lame dad.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.020
Exercise?

34:40.120 --> 34:42.288
Running again.

34:45.320 --> 34:48.251
- How are my test scores?
- Better than expected.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.447
Your heart has made an unusually
strong recovery, Mr. Ladouceur.

34:52.719 --> 34:56.208
You're free to return
to normal activities.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.160
Coaching?

34:59.240 --> 35:02.364
Keep the stress down, but, yes.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.380
Wow, that's great.
It must be such a relief.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.340
Yeah.

35:11.440 --> 35:15.611
She said I could go back to coaching.

35:17.600 --> 35:21.122
So is that your plan, Bob?

35:27.200 --> 35:29.050
We'll see.

35:29.280 --> 35:30.641
Hey.

35:32.320 --> 35:33.740
What's that?

35:33.840 --> 35:34.980
What?

35:35.080 --> 35:36.460
Smells good.

35:36.560 --> 35:39.140
Me or the sauce?

35:39.240 --> 35:41.020
The sauce.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.846
I was hoping it was me.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.961
Ready, and go.

35:55.440 --> 35:56.700
Hey, butt kicks.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.660
Ready, up.

35:58.760 --> 36:00.041
You're late.

36:00.360 --> 36:01.980
Yeah, I been busy.

36:02.080 --> 36:05.620
Well, that explains yesterday.
You missed an entire practice.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.420
I got a note from
the nurse, little Lad.

36:08.520 --> 36:11.740
How insensitive of us, Chris.
He had a tummy ache.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.327
And you call me that again,
I'll drop you.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.580
Now, that's funny.

36:16.680 --> 36:19.780
Nobody misses practice without
clearing it with the captain.

36:19.880 --> 36:24.580
Well, I ain't nobody.
On JV, man, I played both ways.

36:24.680 --> 36:28.980
Caught 38 passes and five picks.
How much practice do I need?

36:29.080 --> 36:32.260
It's not about
It's about us. This team.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.900
Both of y'all can go
ahead and kiss my...

36:35.000 --> 36:36.860
Push me? Team?

36:36.960 --> 36:41.420
Ain't no team. Truth is, it comes down
to four or five of us bringing our game.

36:41.520 --> 36:45.580
Say what you want, Chris, Danny.
This team thing don't mean nothing now.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.100
- Back off!
- Hey, hold up!

36:47.200 --> 36:49.540
"Team" means everything right now.

36:49.640 --> 36:53.500
Look around. To be successful,
you'll have to scrap for everything.

36:53.600 --> 36:57.566
Wanna be a scrappy team?
You're gonna have to respect each other.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.325
Now, get back to practice.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.400
High kicks.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.140
That's how you do it.

37:25.240 --> 37:28.620
That boy do football and basketball.
Y'all got nothing on him.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.740
Hey, I want you.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.280
I want you, boy.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.260
Where the police at?
Because y'all getting robbed.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.927
He just schooled you, man.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.340
Y'all see it. Come on, let's get it.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.740
- Hey.
- Catch you later.

37:49.840 --> 37:53.260
That's how it's done.
That's how it's done, boy.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.620
So when you headed up to Oregon?

37:55.720 --> 37:57.420
First thing tomorrow, man.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.140
Don't forget about us, homes.

37:59.240 --> 38:01.940
Course not, baby.
Of course not. Come on.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.260
Man, all y'all horrible.

38:04.360 --> 38:07.291
Just straight garbage
on the court, no game.

38:13.080 --> 38:17.500
Have you heard from him?
Boy's got to get up early in the morning.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.643
Okay, Mama.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.260
Yo, Pops, what's up?

38:28.360 --> 38:33.282
- You didn't forget to fill the car, did you?
- No, I just did. Supreme.

38:34.360 --> 38:36.642
All right. Home in 10.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.140
He on his way.

38:41.240 --> 38:44.046
Let me go get his cornbread ready.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.860
Yo, what did you forget?

38:50.960 --> 38:52.889
It's me, coz.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.300
Lamarco, you high, dog?

38:55.400 --> 38:57.841
I lost my ride, man.

38:58.120 --> 39:00.084
Where are you?

39:28.800 --> 39:32.780
- Yo, Lamarco. Come on, man.
- One minute. Let me cop these digits.

39:32.880 --> 39:36.540
- Get them and come on. I gotta get home.
- One minute, coz.

39:36.640 --> 39:40.128
You gonna give me them digits, or what?
You see my ride here.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.620
Lamarco, come on!

39:42.720 --> 39:45.127
I'm coming. I'm gonna call you.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.300
School me, player?

39:53.400 --> 39:56.171
Nah, school you.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.324
Oh, my God!

40:05.360 --> 40:08.166
Call an ambulance, man!

40:16.840 --> 40:20.408
We have an 18-year-old
African-American with gunshot wounds.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.726
Mama, you stay here.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.250
Oh, God.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.820
Jesus Christ. No, no.

40:32.920 --> 40:35.500
Oh, no, no, no! That's my son!

40:35.600 --> 40:36.980
- It's all right.
- No!

40:37.080 --> 40:39.965
Let me go! Let me go!

40:40.160 --> 40:41.500
T.K.!

40:41.600 --> 40:44.540
T.K.! That's my son!

40:44.640 --> 40:47.650
Is that our baby?

40:48.360 --> 40:52.087
Oh, no! Oh, no!

41:09.200 --> 41:14.580
Hold on, help is on the way

41:14.680 --> 41:19.522
God hasn't forgotten you

41:20.760 --> 41:23.860
Be not dismayed

41:23.960 --> 41:28.100
Through the rough times in your life

41:28.200 --> 41:32.540
Everything will be all right

41:32.640 --> 41:39.180
Just hold on
'Cause help is on the way

41:39.280 --> 41:44.281
And without further ado,
Coach Bob Ladouceur.

41:52.720 --> 41:55.764
Thank you, Coach Ladouceur.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.325
Minister.

42:04.160 --> 42:07.660
I remember the first time I saw T.K.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.564
He was that...

42:10.000 --> 42:15.240
awkward freshman, all arms
and legs, with an infectious smile.

42:16.440 --> 42:20.486
A coach couldn't help but notice
the smooth grace of his...

42:22.120 --> 42:24.368
athletic ability.

42:32.680 --> 42:36.202
People always ask me what
it's like to never lose.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.940
Today, I am lost.

42:39.040 --> 42:41.368
Lord, have mercy.

42:42.400 --> 42:45.649
It's as if life has taken
more than it gives...

42:46.280 --> 42:48.528
and I don't know if I can handle it.

42:48.960 --> 42:51.322
Lord, I'm struggling.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.460
I wanna understand why.

42:55.560 --> 42:57.820
- Why Terrance?
- Yes, Lord.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.804
Why now?

43:01.040 --> 43:04.900
If we are to call ourselves Christians,
we cannot ask these questions...

43:05.000 --> 43:08.966
because to do so is to question
your benevolence, your divine wisdom.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.969
But today I am lost.

43:13.280 --> 43:15.289
Mr. Kelly.

43:15.520 --> 43:17.006
T-Gram.

43:17.160 --> 43:20.460
I can't even imagine
your pain right now.

43:20.560 --> 43:24.606
But you raised the kind of
young man we all strive for.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.804
We ask our players...

43:28.600 --> 43:31.620
to learn and embrace ideals...

43:31.720 --> 43:33.940
perfection, commitment...

43:34.040 --> 43:37.540
compassion, brotherhood, faith.

43:37.640 --> 43:41.460
From the first time T.K. came
across that field, I saw it.

43:41.560 --> 43:46.020
A kid whose grace
wasn't just athletic...

43:46.120 --> 43:48.322
but genuine in so many ways.

43:50.080 --> 43:52.020
He embodied those ideals.

43:52.120 --> 43:54.163
Yes, Lord.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.482
You never gave up on
anything or anyone.

44:00.640 --> 44:02.251
And I did not teach you.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.163
You taught me.

44:08.240 --> 44:09.726
Thank you...

44:10.200 --> 44:13.060
because when on some
other day I am lost...

44:13.160 --> 44:17.410
and struggling to keep my faith,
I need only remember you.

44:18.400 --> 44:22.220
And for reasons we are not privy to,
God wanted T.K. home.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.522
He is with him now.

44:24.960 --> 44:27.128
May God bless you.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.925
Cam.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.407
Doesn't make no sense, coach.

44:48.520 --> 44:51.200
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do anymore.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.620
You stick to the plan.

44:53.720 --> 44:55.570
Go to Oregon.

45:10.960 --> 45:14.369
Mowing the lawn?
What are you doing out here?

45:14.600 --> 45:16.060
Dancing at our wedding.

45:16.160 --> 45:18.380
With your dad.

45:18.480 --> 45:21.780
He grins, looks over.
You were talking with the priest.

45:21.880 --> 45:25.540
I remember, he leans in and said:

45:25.640 --> 45:30.004
"If you didn't know better, which one
puts the collar on every morning?"

45:33.640 --> 45:36.525
The music stops.

45:37.960 --> 45:40.527
The dance is over.

45:42.640 --> 45:45.650
And I'm heading over to rescue you.

45:49.080 --> 45:52.124
And he said something
I still remember.

45:53.280 --> 45:55.084
What's that?

45:57.960 --> 46:00.766
"I hope you won't be too lonely."

46:01.960 --> 46:03.700
Your dad raised you.

46:03.800 --> 46:05.900
He loved you...

46:06.000 --> 46:08.965
but when he died...

46:09.200 --> 46:13.450
I think he felt like he
didn't really know you.

46:14.520 --> 46:18.281
Till a minute ago, I thought
that might happen to me too.

46:20.320 --> 46:24.081
I was sitting up, watching
you sleep, and it hit me.

46:26.560 --> 46:30.700
Some people don't
know who they are...

46:30.800 --> 46:32.923
all that they have.

46:33.200 --> 46:36.051
They just know something's missing.

46:38.720 --> 46:41.651
So I was just sitting out here...

46:45.680 --> 46:48.611
getting ready to let you go again.

46:57.040 --> 46:58.940
No, still way too slow.

46:59.040 --> 47:02.528
You need to blow off the ball.
Faster step. Strike with intent.

47:04.400 --> 47:09.420
On Friday, we play a football team that's
been preparing for this game for a year.

47:09.520 --> 47:13.900
You're not hitting with intensity,
conditioning with discipline.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.020
Salinas, pull your weight. Come on.

47:16.120 --> 47:18.540
Oh, you're dogging it.
You're dogging it.

47:18.640 --> 47:21.660
- Commitment.
- Bellevue is bigger and stronger than us.

47:21.760 --> 47:25.169
Accountability. Perfect effort.
Finally, love.

47:26.120 --> 47:29.860
This bond is what has led Spartans
to achieve far more than anyone...

47:29.960 --> 47:32.900
including themselves,
believed they were capable of.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.180
Six, seven.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.900
Without it, you may
continue to win games.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.940
Rep it out, Tayshon. Four more.

47:40.040 --> 47:43.210
But you will have lost the
chance to become Spartans.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.170
Eight's good.

47:48.440 --> 47:52.580
Welcome to Seattle,
where the 2004 season opens...

47:52.680 --> 47:55.406
with a matchup between
two of the best teams.

48:00.360 --> 48:01.641
Come on!

48:03.560 --> 48:05.330
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

48:07.320 --> 48:10.940
The powerhouse De La Salle Spartans
and their national record...

48:11.040 --> 48:14.340
- ...151-game winning streak...
- Keep the streak alive.

48:14.440 --> 48:17.723
...taking on defending
Washington State champs, Bellevue.

48:18.840 --> 48:22.965
Down, set, hut!

48:28.520 --> 48:32.406
Strong right, lead at two.
Veer, pass, drag. Let's go.

48:33.160 --> 48:36.011
Strong left! Strong left!

48:36.240 --> 48:40.240
- Open back 11. Back 11.
- Down, set, hut!

48:45.680 --> 48:47.700
Rick Salinas throws a perfect pass...

48:47.800 --> 48:51.060
connecting with Danny
Ladouceur for a 13-yard gain.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.124
Sixteen mid-line on one. Ready?

48:55.240 --> 48:56.540
Go get them, Beast.

48:56.640 --> 49:01.460
Chris Ryan. This man has the size and
speed to play anywhere in the country.

49:01.560 --> 49:04.525
Red dog! Red dog! Set, hut-hut!

49:10.760 --> 49:13.660
Go, go, go! Come on, Chris!
Come on, Chris!

49:13.760 --> 49:17.020
Come on, Beast! Come on, Beast!
Come on, Beast!

49:17.120 --> 49:19.100
That's it! Yeah!

49:19.200 --> 49:22.580
Chris Ryan, showing off his ability,
breaks a 45-yard run...

49:22.680 --> 49:26.300
to give De La Salle a 7-to-0 lead.

49:26.400 --> 49:30.620
That's a great run, but our left tackle
needs to seal that backer better.

49:30.720 --> 49:34.288
Ryan has been a scoring machine,
amassing 52 touchdowns...

49:34.480 --> 49:36.808
in his sophomore and junior seasons.

49:37.480 --> 49:39.660
He is now 36 touchdowns away...

49:39.760 --> 49:43.660
from breaking the California
career touchdown record.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.962
Twenty-two. Hut, set, hut!

49:48.040 --> 49:49.924
Beaser!

49:51.160 --> 49:53.980
This is like the drill we
run every day at practice!

49:54.080 --> 49:57.011
Shed that block and get
to the ball carrier!

49:57.840 --> 49:59.340
Okay.

49:59.440 --> 50:00.940
They're changing it up.

50:01.040 --> 50:03.740
They're in man to man,
then dropping to cover two.

50:03.840 --> 50:06.460
Why don't you simplify it?
Read the free safety.

50:06.560 --> 50:11.100
Free safety's gonna tell you everything.
What? Someone break one?

50:11.200 --> 50:13.209
Stop him! Stop him!

50:14.320 --> 50:15.681
Get after him!

50:17.880 --> 50:19.161
Jeez!

50:20.240 --> 50:23.860
Bellevue's Taylor King
breaks a 76-yard touchdown.

50:23.960 --> 50:26.740
This Bellevue team is not
afraid of De La Salle.

50:26.840 --> 50:29.566
We may just have a game here.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.204
And yet another completion.
First down, Bellevue.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.449
They're playing exactly like us.

50:48.240 --> 50:51.489
This Wolverine passing attack
is shredding De La Salle.

50:51.880 --> 50:54.180
It's a three-deep and you got beat?

50:54.280 --> 50:57.820
Your responsibility is the quarterback
when they run the option.

50:57.920 --> 51:01.010
Right? We practiced all
of this, come on, now!

51:04.200 --> 51:06.580
You have to break down
to make that stop.

51:06.680 --> 51:09.167
Don't get caught flat-footed.

51:13.880 --> 51:15.525
No, no, no!

51:15.760 --> 51:18.740
Stop him! Stop him!

51:18.840 --> 51:20.260
Oh, God!

51:20.360 --> 51:22.300
Here's something nobody expected.

51:22.400 --> 51:26.491
The Wolverines are controlling the line
of scrimmage against De La Salle.

51:30.080 --> 51:33.045
They're beating us off
the ball on every snap.

51:33.640 --> 51:36.820
- Down.
- Blue 22! Blue 22!

51:36.920 --> 51:38.140
Set.

51:38.240 --> 51:39.940
Go left! Go left!

51:40.040 --> 51:41.480
Hut!

51:47.400 --> 51:50.900
Bellevue scores to give the
Washington State champions...

51:51.000 --> 51:54.966
a 28-to-7 lead over
powerhouse De La Salle.

51:56.480 --> 51:58.284
We're gonna lose.

52:03.320 --> 52:08.082
Hit Danny on a 12-yard curl in the seam
between the linebacker and the safety.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.802
Down, set, hut!

52:19.960 --> 52:23.780
Danny Ladouceur drops a pass.
His dad will not be happy about that.

52:23.880 --> 52:25.900
Gotta get it to the players.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.328
He's gotta catch it, Bev.

52:28.600 --> 52:31.451
Ready. Set, hut!

52:35.240 --> 52:37.500
Ladouceur's hit and
coughs up the ball!

52:37.600 --> 52:39.609
Gotta hold on to that ball, Danny!

52:39.960 --> 52:42.925
Bellevue recovers. Bellevue recovers.

53:07.520 --> 53:12.328
- I don't care how good you think you are!
- I'm the best receiver on this team.

53:12.960 --> 53:17.006
I ran my route, they attacked, man.
Ran the ball right by you.

53:20.200 --> 53:22.900
- Come on! Let's go, let's go!
- Eight, seven...

53:23.000 --> 53:25.500
six, five, four...

53:25.600 --> 53:28.565
- Down, set, hut!
- ...three, two, one.

53:29.280 --> 53:32.460
And that's it. The streak
is over! The streak is over!

53:32.560 --> 53:36.660
The longest winning streak
in sports history is now over...

53:36.760 --> 53:40.540
as the Bellevue Wolverines have
shocked the De La Salle Spartans...

53:40.640 --> 53:45.846
in perhaps the biggest upset
in high-school football history.

54:31.240 --> 54:33.807
Are you okay? It's okay.

54:50.040 --> 54:53.005
Hey, hey! We don't do that here.

54:53.480 --> 54:55.523
We don't do that.

54:59.200 --> 55:02.620
Reporters, friends,
family, strangers.

55:02.720 --> 55:04.860
They're all gonna ask the same thing:

55:04.960 --> 55:06.620
"What happened?"

55:06.720 --> 55:09.140
This is a question
that's gonna follow you.

55:09.240 --> 55:11.420
"How did you lose the streak?"

55:11.520 --> 55:15.140
And every time,
you're gonna answer the truth:

55:15.240 --> 55:19.331
"Bellevue played better than us and
we lost a high-school football game."

55:19.600 --> 55:21.689
That's football.

55:22.080 --> 55:24.248
But it's not you.

55:25.520 --> 55:28.540
Don't let a game define who you are.

55:28.640 --> 55:31.889
Let the way you live
your lives do that.

55:35.960 --> 55:37.571
Coach.

55:40.800 --> 55:44.660
I truly believe that life's
most impressionable lessons...

55:44.760 --> 55:47.420
are ones where something
bad happens to you...

55:47.520 --> 55:50.644
or something challenging
confronts you.

55:51.680 --> 55:56.169
No one can climb into your head and hear
what that little voice is saying to you.

55:56.680 --> 56:00.168
Is it saying, "Oh, no,
we lost the streak"?

56:00.640 --> 56:02.285
Well, what's it gonna say?

56:02.800 --> 56:06.846
After today, you're gonna find
out a lot about yourselves.

56:07.320 --> 56:11.491
And you know something, we're all gonna
find out what this team is made of.

56:19.960 --> 56:24.051
The effort you put in during the
off-season was commendable.

56:26.680 --> 56:29.406
But it has not translated
onto the field.

56:32.880 --> 56:35.260
You've got to decide
what you wanna be.

56:35.360 --> 56:40.300
I get the feeling from you as a team that
you just wanna hop on that throne...

56:40.400 --> 56:43.140
and place the championship
ring on your finger.

56:43.240 --> 56:45.727
That you're at De La Salle
and deserve that.

56:46.040 --> 56:49.540
For the most part we're inconsistent,
mistake-prone, ragged...

56:49.640 --> 56:52.161
and not very physical.

56:52.960 --> 56:54.740
That's where we are.

56:54.840 --> 56:57.940
As much as you don't wanna hear it,
that's my assessment.

56:58.040 --> 57:01.860
Do I feel like you can pull this off
and earn the right to that throne?

57:01.960 --> 57:04.060
- Yeah, I do.
- Attaboy, attaboy.

57:04.160 --> 57:07.260
I'm not hoping you play well
against Clayton Valley.

57:07.360 --> 57:10.700
You have to.
You have to play well this week.

57:10.800 --> 57:14.980
Even if you step it up and play
at your ability level, it still won't be easy.

57:15.080 --> 57:18.363
You're gonna have to fight
for victories in those games.

57:19.440 --> 57:21.688
All right, that's it, that's it!

57:23.280 --> 57:27.220
Oh, he's got a seam! Go, go, go!

57:27.320 --> 57:29.124
- Nice work.
- Oh, for...!

57:31.960 --> 57:35.140
Despite a well-played game,
De La Salle comes up short...

57:35.240 --> 57:38.660
and after two games,
is still winless in this young season.

57:38.760 --> 57:43.140
Bob Ladouceur's gonna have to figure
something out to get this team on track...

57:43.240 --> 57:46.171
if they plan on making it
to the playoffs this year.

57:53.800 --> 57:55.380
Pick up your heads.

57:55.480 --> 57:57.780
Meet me at the locker room tomorrow.

57:57.880 --> 57:59.605
Eight a.m.

58:12.200 --> 58:13.686
What's up, Alex?

58:16.040 --> 58:19.323
- Miss you. I'm all sweaty.
- It's okay. It was a tough game.

58:20.440 --> 58:22.620
Party is tomorrow, if you wanna go.

58:22.720 --> 58:24.900
Maybe. I don't know. If you do.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.140
- Are you kidding me?
- Dad, please.

58:27.240 --> 58:30.100
You let some punk pull you
down at the two-yard line.

58:30.200 --> 58:33.180
- I scored three touchdowns.
- How many did you promise?

58:33.280 --> 58:35.420
- Mr. Ryan, please.
- Laurie, stop.

58:35.520 --> 58:38.140
Forty-one blast. Run it, now.

58:38.240 --> 58:41.140
- Dad, it's midnight. I'm tired.
- So am I.

58:41.240 --> 58:45.126
- Forty-one blast. Run it, now.
- You run it.

58:47.720 --> 58:49.620
You listen close.

58:49.720 --> 58:52.060
I want that record.

58:52.160 --> 58:54.780
He's not gonna get it for
you with a busted rib.

58:54.880 --> 58:56.161
Now let him go.

58:57.160 --> 59:01.260
Hey, coach. Let's you and me
huddle up for a second, okay?

59:01.360 --> 59:04.689
I don't usually huddle
up with parents, Mick.

59:29.440 --> 59:31.980
You think this is
gonna freak them out?

59:32.080 --> 59:34.521
I certainly hope so.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.409
- Good morning, Carol.
- Hi, Bob.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.164
Nurse Ballard is a friend of mine.
She's in charge of the entire nursing staff.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.180
Today, we will be
following her orders.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.940
Coach Lad and I worked at the Juvenile
Detention Center in Richmond.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.700
It was a little longer ago
than I'd rather admit.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.004
So you guys play a tough game.
Anybody ever been injured?

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.682
You've never been injured?

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.921
It's part of the game. You don't
think about it, you bounce back.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.340
You're very brave.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.060
This is not that.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.300
Here, nobody bounces. Break into three
groups. When you hear your name...

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.810
follow the nurse who called it to
the appropriate unit. Let's go.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:59.124
Nurse Adams is in charge of the Recovery
Ward, and she will take over from here.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.860
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Welcome to the VA Recovery Ward.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.208
So here we specialize
in transplants...

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.380
amputations and general
rehabilitation for limb recovery.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:14.641
Our focus here is on full
recovery, body and spirit.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.860
If this is too hard for
anybody, don't come in.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.889
Why would it be?

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.380
All our patients are
here for rehabilitation.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:30.260
Our job is to help them recover from
injuries received during combat.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:35.460
It's long and difficult, but we're dedicated
to getting them back to functioning lives.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.842
- Hey, May.
- Hey.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.900
Hello?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.420
I'll be right there.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.371
Hey, would you do me a favor?
Would you finish up?

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.050
Thanks.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.324
What are you looking at?

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.620
Oh, no, no, I just...

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.380
- You just what?
- Nothing.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.100
What's the matter, boy?

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.420
Get on. Pace me.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.820
- What?
- You do speak English, right?

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.360
Get on, pace me.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.964
What? What did I do? Did I hurt you?

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.420
No, I'm just messing with you, man.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.802
I can't feel anything.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.860
Man, I...

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:02.340
Sometimes my legs hurt so bad,
I'd wish I didn't feel anything.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.610
No, you don't.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.087
No, I don't.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.740
- What's wrong with you, boy? You blind?
- My bad, man. I didn't see you.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.020
No, man. I swear I didn't even see you.
Hey, what the...? Hey! Hey, man!

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.740
Is that...? Was that pee?

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.780
Well, it sure ain't no Gatorade.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.100
Heck, no!

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.580
Hey, nurse!

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.166
Come on, man!

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.566
Come on, Danny.
You gotta speed this up.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.540
All right. Let him catch up, though.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.810
Oh, great. You're a real gentleman.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.660
On, baby.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.566
Stop. Salinas. Quit it.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.450
- Salinas, enough.
- I don't know if it is fast enough.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.525
Show me what you got.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.131
Let's go, Danny.
Show him what you got.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.326
One night we get overrun.
I just curled up, waiting to die.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.524
Till somebody dragged me
into this deserted mosque.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:17.246
I look at the guy who just saved my butt.
He's just some hillbilly kid from Arkansas.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.700
Hey, at least you got out.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.243
If they could put me back together,
I'd go back today.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.820
For what?

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:28.340
My unit. Listen, half of
them are still over there.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.100
That don't make no sense.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:34.166
It's simple. Over there,
who you are in the world don't matter.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.561
Fighting for your
country don't matter.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.841
What does?

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.540
The guy next to you.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.763
It's a brotherhood.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.962
Let's go, boys.
You're running. Come on.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.011
Come on, Danny.
Spartans for life, baby.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.124
Live together. Die together.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.940
Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.460
You wanna go faster?

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.966
Let's go faster.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.726
Don't let us down, baby. Come on.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:11.260
Let's go, baby. Come on, Danny. You
got this, dog. Don't stop, baby. Come on.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.380
Do not stop on me. Do not stop.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.728
You're a Spartan. Don't stop, Danny.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.660
I can't. I can't.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.203
- What?
- He's gonna go forever.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.370
No.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.848
Not forever, Danny.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.369
Just a little more than you.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:03.807
Long Beach Poly.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:07.820
By every measure, the best high-school
football team in the nation.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.761
Offensive line,
average over 300 pounds.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:16.180
Their starters. Beaser.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.209
Meet Buster Matthews.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.300
Three hundred and thirty
pounds of pure aggression.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.740
Poly runs 60 percent of
their plays behind him.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.805
And you're gonna face
him the whole game.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.849
But we have speed, right?

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.284
Their number-one wideout
clocks a 4.4 40.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.083
I don't think we have
anyone that fast.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.340
Their key player?
Strong safety Darnell Bing.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:45.167
Just committed to SC and plays
like he's been there three years.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.060
Tayshon. You're a better
match for this guy's speed.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.806
You're gonna start against Poly.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:00.170
You're going into the most physically
demanding moment of your life.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.930
Drive, drive, drive!

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.324
Let me go again! Let me go again!

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.243
Way to go, Beaser! Way to go!
All the way to the line.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.327
One tradition...

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.260
that defined this program is the
willingness of our players...

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:05.460
to share their emotions at
the end of these meetings.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.100
This team hasn't done that.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.724
You guys are still carrying around the
stigma of losing the streak. Forget that.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.131
Forget it.

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:17.567
Open up.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.928
Talk to each other.

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:41.180
My brother was captain
of the 2000 team.

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:44.450
In four years,
he never lost one game.

01:08:46.479 --> 01:08:50.810
When we blew the streak,
I couldn't look him in the eye.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.082
I'm done with that.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.500
Everything we've been
through was for a reason:

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.848
To bring us together.

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:03.568
I love you guys.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:08.260
I will die on that field
before I let you down.

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:11.325
Collapse. Not die.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.247
It's just a high-school
football game.

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:21.100
I've been on this team four years.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.483
I've never once played in
a varsity football game.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.765
I mean, I'm not good enough.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:33.524
And that's okay, because the
greatest moments of my life...

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.924
were the times I've spent
on this team with you.

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:41.002
I've never been prouder of
anything than being a Spartan.

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:55.407
When we first watched Poly's film,
and I saw Buster Matthews...

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.683
I was scared.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:04.045
Then I remembered something Coach
Lad told us on my first day of practice.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.207
"Face your fears."

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.900
That night I pasted Buster's name and
his number on my ceiling above my bed.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.885
And every night since,
no matter how tired I was...

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.900
I've been saying:

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.444
"Buster Matthews, number 79...

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:26.723
you are mine."

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.603
A hundred times every night.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.042
I promise you, guys.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:36.203
We're not gonna lose because
of Buster Matthews.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.486
My old man is insane.

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:55.563
My mom used to keep him in line,
but he wore her out.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.810
Once I made the team,
I thought it'd be better.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.208
He became an animal.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.488
I hated him.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.340
Funny thing is, what...

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.689
What saved me was being on this team.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:21.890
I used to play as hard as I could because
I thought that would make him happy.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.529
And then I'd be happy.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:28.602
You guys love me whether I'm
scoring touchdowns or not.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:35.005
I was missing that,
and you guys gave it to me.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.044
I could never repay you for that.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.842
But come tomorrow...

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.561
I don't play for him.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.205
I play for you.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:00.300
Welcome to Veterans Stadium, home of
the Long Beach Poly Jackrabbits...

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.580
where the De La Salle Spartans
of Concord, California...

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.780
have traveled to the Southland for
this matchup of powerhouse programs.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.527
At the end of last season,
these were the top two teams...

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:17.005
and this was hyped as the game
for the national championship.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.887
Dude, these guys are giants.

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:49.140
Poly is riding high on
34 straight victories.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.020
De La Salle's 151-game-winning
streak ended two weeks ago...

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.300
and the Spartans come into this game
with an abysmal 0 and 2 record.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.260
This team is struggling and
is nowhere as talented...

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.220
as previous De La Salle teams.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.820
This is the toughest game
on their schedule...

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.060
and the most pivotal of their season.

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.700
If they can't get a win...

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:12.971
they will go into league play 0
and 3 and with zero momentum.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.940
And here we go.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.564
The first nationally televised
high-school football game is underway.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.060
Ryan takes the opening kickoff.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:33.844
And it's gonna be hot as the temperature
on the field has reached 95 degrees.

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:40.420
Poly is big and fast. Their offensive and
defensive lines outweigh the Spartans...

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.380
by over 50 pounds per man.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.205
Set, hut!

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.300
Chris Ryan gets pounded
into the turf.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.648
That's all you got?

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.246
Set, hut!

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:59.460
Salinas drops back, and his first pass
of the day goes to Tayshon Lanear.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:04.020
- Darnell Bing lays a big lick on him.
- Twenty-two power pass throwback.

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.060
Get leverage on the corner,
occupy the free safety.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.980
- Chris will be wide open behind you.
- Let's go.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.486
Hut!

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.485
There he goes! That's it, that's it!

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.043
Go, go, go!

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.620
- Touchdown!
- Chris Ryan somersaults...

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.900
into the end zone,
giving the Spartans a six-point lead.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.460
Ryan is a force on the field
and has D-1 size and speed.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.220
That's one, Chris.
I need two more from you.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:43.140
Chris. Nice run. Dive in the end zone
one more time and I bench you.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.260
We're not a celebrating team.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.500
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.380
We knew they were quick.
Now we've seen how quick.

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.446
Settle them down. Let's show them
real speed. Hit Jones on a one. Go.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:58.500
Go, red 27, red 27, set!

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.245
Hut!

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.169
Lawrence launches a bomb
to Derrick Jones...

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.763
and he just can't hang on.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.700
Yeah!

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:13.860
You know why he dropped that? He ain't
been dragging truck tires all week.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.500
Yeah!

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.620
Beaser! Only second down.
Keep your head in the game.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:23.500
The heat on the field is brutal,
but this Spartan team has come to play.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:28.010
They are banging heads with 300-pound
linemen out there and holding their own.

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.820
What they lack in size...

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.806
they make up in quickness off the ball,
determination and toughness.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.525
Reverse!

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.780
- No! No!
- That's how you play football!

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.165
Poly gets its first score
of the game, tying it at 7.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.260
On-field temperatures have
soared to 100 degrees.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.620
On the pre-game show, De La Salle's
assistant coach Terry Eidson said...

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:04.526
the heat could be a
factor in today's game.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.100
He wasn't kidding.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.084
Down.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.340
Over me! U 52!

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.961
Set, hut!

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.380
Salinas fires a 29-yard
pass to Tayshon Lanear...

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:26.260
for his first touchdown of the game.

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:31.361
- Yeah! Yeah!
- De La Salle, back in the lead, 13 to 7.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.820
With eight minutes
left in the half...

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.420
De La Salle's two-way players
are struggling to get back up.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.420
And because Poly has a hundred-man
roster, nobody plays both ways.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:47.008
This could be a huge
factor in today's game.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.620
Five-forty down! Fifty-fifty!

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:54.700
- You know why they call me Buster?
- You're stupid enough to let them?

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.604
Set, hut!

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.900
Nice hit.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.700
Joe Beaser sheds a block
by big Buster Matthews...

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:08.480
and makes a huge stop on fourth down.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.180
Split! Split!

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.970
Doubles!

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.121
Hut!

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.801
Stop him! Come on!

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.540
Tayshon Lanear reels in his
second touchdown of the game...

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.844
putting the Spartans up 21 to 7.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:45.420
Lanear has been playing
both ways the first half...

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:48.820
and is exhausted down
on the De La Salle bench.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.043
Offense, get in there!

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.651
Big third down here for Poly as
the clock is under a minute to go.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.371
Did you see that? Did you see that?

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.804
Get off of him, man!

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.940
Come on, guys! Let's go, let's go!

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.860
Fourth down and after that
big play by Chris Ryan...

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.083
Poly is going for a field goal.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.690
From 34 yards out,
the ball is up and good.

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.641
Poly cuts the De La
Salle Lead to 21-10.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:32.020
Eighteen seconds on the clock.
Poly is spread wide.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:35.660
- Looks like they're kicking away.
- Onside! Ball, ball!

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:40.100
No, it's an onside kick. The ball
is on the turf. There's a pileup.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:43.060
Officials are diving in, and...

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.580
- We got it! We got it! We got it!
- Our ball.

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.660
- Poly has the ball.
- You have got to be kidding me.

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:52.340
A perfectly executed onside kick
with 12 seconds left in the half.

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.900
When he lines up,
they're gonna throw to him.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.900
Well, I can't go out there
and play for them. Pass! Pass!

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.804
Set, hut!

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:11.100
Lawrence finds his big tight
end as the clock expires...

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.820
in one of the best first
halves you will see.

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:18.409
Long Beach Poly has pulled within
four points of De La Salle, 21-17.

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.928
You need water?

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.531
Move. Open that window, man.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.690
Water!

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.363
Where's that ice bucket?

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.569
Here, give me that.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.248
Give it to him. All right.

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.289
- Take it. Put it on the neck.
- Yeah, yeah. I got it.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.260
All right. Lay him down.

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.020
On his back here.

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.482
Watch his head, watch his head.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.521
How are you doing?
All right, take it easy.

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.780
Terry. Our guys are gassed.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:15.860
Poly's coming on strong. There's no
way we can start Beaser or Chris...

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.004
or any of our two-way
players in the second half.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.580
Empty the coolers,
check the concession stands.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.460
Grab all the ice they have.
You've got two minutes.

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.060
- Right.
- I need your help.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.980
There is no a.c. in here.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.420
Assess the kids' physical condition.

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.900
Determine if they can play.
You're gonna handle substitutions.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.020
- Okay, coach.
- Rotate in the second-stringers.

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.220
I don't want any kid on that
field that's not fit to play.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.807
I don't care if it costs us the game.

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:54.260
The Spartans are literally
dragging themselves back...

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.020
on what has become a
100-yard blast furnace...

01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:01.325
as the heat continues to be
a major factor in this game.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.900
Hey, Poly.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.380
Anybody so much as waves at
your moms, you're on suspension.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.900
There is nothing to celebrate, yet.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.140
Finish these guys. They're fading.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.660
- Long Beach!
- Poly!

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.020
- Long Beach!
- Poly!

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.420
- Long Beach! Long Beach!
- Poly! Poly!

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:22.460
Sanchez, Antoine, Lance. Come on.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.660
Coach Bob Ladouceur is buying
some rest for his starters...

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.247
by sending in his second-stringers.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.607
Down, set, hut!

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.540
- Come on, you guys!
- Here we go, here we go, here we go.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.660
Hut, hut!

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:49.900
Poly is pounding on De La
Salle's second string.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.009
Can somebody please make a tackle?

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.300
- Get in.
- Coming in for De La Salle...

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:00.660
- ...number 25, Arturo Garcia.
- Right here, right here.

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:04.980
- You got it, buddy. Come on.
- Here we go, Spartans.

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.203
Set, hut!

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:13.020
Poly executes a perfect screen
pass for an eight-yard gain.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.482
- Hey, hey! What was that?
- Oh, man.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.460
Buster Matthews has crushed
one of the smallest players...

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.220
on the De La Salle team.

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:26.460
Arturo Garcia is listed
at only 147 pounds.

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:30.560
That's gonna cost the Jackrabbits
15 yards, making it third and long.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.900
Oh, man!
Arturo Garcia gets revenge...

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.060
making a huge tackle to keep Poly
from making a critical first down.

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.340
Get up, Arturo.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:50.380
Spartans' second string is playing
tough against the bigger Poly team...

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.260
and made them scrape for every yard.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:57.420
The question is, how much longer
can Terry Eidson leave these guys in...

01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:00.087
- ...before Poly's offense explodes?
- Great!

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.085
That was amazing. Amazing.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:08.128
Poly lines up for a field goal.
High snap.

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.244
The kick is up, and...

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.046
- ...no good.
- Yeah! Let's go!

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.220
See that? That's on you.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:22.500
If you don't make that stop,
they don't miss that field goal.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:26.361
Poly misses. The score remains 21-17.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:32.020
Yo, coach, coach. Yo, take a look
at us, man. We ready to go.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.900
- Beaser?
- I'm ready.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.180
- Tayshon?
- I'm ready.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.820
- Ready?
- Let's do it.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.884
Bob. They're ready.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.140
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.728
- All right, D, 40 cover two and go.
- Let's go, man. Let's go.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:48.169
It looks like the starters are
running back onto the field.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:53.500
This is no longer about who the bigger,
faster, stronger players are.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.087
It's about who plays with more heart.

01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.488
- Relax. We're good.
- That's right.

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.530
- Fifty!
- Draw right.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:05.327
Set, hut!

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:11.846
Go, go, go!

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.090
No! No!

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.820
The Jackrabbits have come back...

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:26.886
and now lead 24-21 over
an exhausted De La Salle.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.300
Chris is getting blocked by 280-pound
guards while playing linebacker...

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:37.580
then being tackled by 300-pounders
when he's running the ball.

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:41.566
- That's how you wrap them up! Good job!
- Get off of him!

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:52.620
- How are they still on their feet?
- Those linebackers are flying out of there.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:53.940
Run the draw. Go.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.446
Set, hut!

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.968
Come on, Chris! Come on, Chris!

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.940
Yeah! Go!

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:10.820
Chris Ryan's spectacular run puts
the Spartans back on top, 28-24.

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:13.900
What do you think?
You can't play with the Beast.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.860
You can't play with the Beast.

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:20.460
With two minutes left in what is a
classic high-school football game...

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.285
Hut!

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.340
Shed these blocks!

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:26.847
These guys are half your size.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:31.683
Start playing like the number-one team
in this country before you aren't!

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:47.100
Derrick Jones makes an
unbelievable fingertip catch...

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.008
at the Spartans' four-yard
line as 15,000 fans go crazy.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:58.940
With 1:02 left in the game,
Long Beach Poly has a first down...

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.700
- ...on De La Salle's four-yard line.
- Hold them.

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.340
Blue 32. Blue 37.

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.608
Set, hut!

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.860
Tayshon Lanear with a
monster hit on first down.

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.820
- Textbook!
- This kid has played a terrific game...

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:22.220
- ...in his first start.
- Double-tight rocket special. Go.

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.140
Looks like Foster is injured on the
play as he limps off the field.

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:31.206
You're in that corner for Foster.
That ball goes up, come down with it.

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.605
Okay.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.900
Pulling out all the stops, Lara is sending
in sophomore fullback Jason Knight.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.524
At 257 pounds, this kid is bigger
than most pro running backs.

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.860
Bang them. Do not let them score.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.162
Blue 72. Set, hut!

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.249
Pass! Pass! Pass!

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.771
Yes!

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.660
Wow, what a save.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.220
The tight end was open
in the end zone...

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.900
but Danny Ladouceur
comes out of nowhere...

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.980
- ...to make a huge play.
- All right.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.140
- Watch the sweep.
- Break for 22.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:20.771
Set, hut!

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:35.620
Spartan linebacker Davis makes another
big stop, but Chris Ryan is down.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.100
This would be a huge
loss for De La Salle.

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.740
- Let me see. Let me see.
- Get away.

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.780
Get out. Get out, come on.

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:46.323
Only way I'm going out of
this game is on a stretcher.

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:50.940
- All right, hold on.
- Fourth and goal, folks.

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:54.660
This game has come down to one play.

01:27:54.760 --> 01:28:00.500
A critical play, not just for the game,
but for the rest of the Spartans' season.

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.100
Poly lines up in a Power I.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:06.324
Green 37. Green 37.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.449
Down.

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:14.047
Forty back. Watch out for 2.

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.802
Come on, D. Come on, D.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.371
Yeah! Yeah!

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.529
Yeah, Spartans! Let's go!

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.580
De La Salle started their season
0 and 2 and lost their win streak...

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.460
but have come back to stun
the football world...

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:14.140
by knocking off the number-one
rated team in the country.

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:17.820
Folks, I have played football
and gone home exhausted...

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.380
I have broadcast games
and gone home elated...

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:25.480
but today, I go home inspired.

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.620
The De La Salle Spartans
have a new lease on life...

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.700
as they go into league games
in Northern California.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:35.322
Hey, coach. Coach Ladouceur.
Can I get a comment?

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.730
Danny.

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:42.220
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.966
You made a heck of a
play on second down.

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.283
You saved the game.

01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.969
Thanks, coach.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.288
Yeah!

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.140
Fantastic. Everyone looks great.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:15.460
Tonight, the feeling is electric.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.860
The team's rolling up right now,
it couldn't be more exciting.

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.207
This is what these people...

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.700
have been waiting for.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:23.940
Tayshon, come on.

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:26.740
- Beaser, take that sign down.
- Yes, sir.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:29.340
Come on, buddy.
Don't be shy, chat with us.

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.740
Hey, man, take it down.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:35.170
How does it feel to go from being the
biggest loser to the biggest winner?

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.900
- It's great.
- Great?

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.443
Dude, you are on your
way to a new streak!

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:43.046
No, no.

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:46.047
Streak!

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.540
Our goal is to go out and give
the perfect effort on every play.

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:52.380
Perfect effort? The secret?

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.420
But we a team,
and Chris Ryan is like...

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:58.700
ls dope, no doubt, but,
look, man, you are a star.

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:02.100
You're the man who's gonna
lead DLS to the next what?

01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:04.140
- The next what?
- Streak!

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.100
Streak! Streak! Streak!

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:07.540
Another streak, baby!

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:10.700
Yes! One hundred and fifty games!

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.700
- Streak! Streak! Streak!
- Let's go.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.700
Streak! Streak! Streak!

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:23.087
Streak! Streak! Streak!

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:38.967
There he goes!

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.420
Growing up is tough.

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.722
It's not easy.

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:52.322
That's what our program's about.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.420
It ain't about the football.

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:58.451
It ain't about scoring
the touchdowns.

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:03.090
It's about moving you...

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:09.460
- ...in a direction that can help you grow up.
- And forgive us for our trespasses...

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.140
So when you take your
place out in the world...

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:16.490
or out in our community,
you can be depended on.

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:26.049
You guys are rock stars!

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.211
Great game, Chris!

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:32.808
- Hey, streak 2.0!
- It's a streak, man.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.020
Faculty housing is also subsidized.

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.580
What's the offer?

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:44.980
Three hundred fifty thousand.
Three years. Firm.

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:46.645
Performance bonus. Car.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:50.650
Stanford sees you as a
valuable investment.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:21.380
Hey, coach. Great game Friday.
Three more touchdowns for the Beast.

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:23.380
Yeah, he played well.

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:25.260
- Whole team did.
- Hey, Chris!

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.740
Over here! Hi!

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.180
What's up?

01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.580
Get ready to break
that scoring record.

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:33.340
Got a place for the
trophy all picked out.

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.100
- Hey, Mickey?
- Yeah?

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:39.121
Did Chris show you the thesis he
wrote for my class on Matthew 23:12?

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:42.020
Amazingly insightful
for someone his age.

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:45.688
Really terrific. You should read it.

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.340
Matthew 23:12? Seriously?

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:53.460
What's he talking about?

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.740
We're on our way to
a championship, a state record.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.300
Those who exalt themselves
will be humbled...

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.940
those who humble themselves
will be exalted.

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:03.300
- Exalted?
- Yeah.

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:07.810
You get 37 touchdowns in the
season, then you'll be exalted.

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:16.700
Do you realize what winning this record
is gonna mean for you? For your life?

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:20.100
Do you have any idea how
people are gonna look at you?

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.528
How they're gonna respect you?

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:25.380
Breaking this record,
you'll have something...

01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:29.446
that nobody can ever
take from you. Nobody.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.441
That's why I push you so hard.
It's not about me, it's about you.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.441
You're a salesman, Dad.

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.167
I'm a what?

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.242
You sell cars.

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.688
Don't try and sell me.

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.820
This is for you.

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:53.180
I'm just another one of your
trophies you keep in your case.

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:57.580
Like all the medals you've been collecting
to show everybody when they walk in.

01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:59.180
I am sick of it.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:02.300
What are you trying to say?
You don't want this record?

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.260
What do you care?
It's always about what you want!

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:08.300
You little punk.
Don't you ever talk to me like that!

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.380
While you live in my house,
you will do as I say...

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:15.580
and you will show me the respect
I deserve! You understand me?

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:18.180
Now you tell me with
that mouth of yours...

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:22.121
you promise me that you'll go
out and get me that record.

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.648
Promise me, Chris.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.180
Okay.

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:29.900
No, Chris. I wanna hear
you say it. Say it!

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.260
I promise I'll get you
that record, Dad!

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.403
Attaboy.

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:46.020
And in local sports, we toss it to Jim,
who's standing by at De La Salle high.

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:50.060
De La Salle Spartans pulled off one
of the greatest comebacks in sports.

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.860
After a devastating opening...

01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:54.660
they're poised to compete
for their 13th championship.

01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:57.260
Dad, look. It's about
the championship game.

01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:01.620
All around me and very excited are
the new generation of Spartans.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:04.820
- What grade are you guys in?
- Sophomores, play on the JV.

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:08.340
You're riding a nine-game streak.
What do you think about that?

01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:11.660
If we go undefeated in our junior-
and senior-year season...

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:14.740
we're gonna push this streak
to 33 games in a row.

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.580
Thirty-three, 33, 33!

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:18.940
Thirty-three games in a row.

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.540
- Thirty-three, 33, 33!
- Back to you.

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:24.081
Thirty-three, 33, 33!

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.530
Bob?

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.729
Hey, you.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:54.361
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:02.367
Are you seriously considering that?

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:05.180
You know, when we started
this 25 years ago...

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:07.460
there was no Internet.

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:09.540
No high-school football on TV.

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:12.660
Not every kid alive was a celebrity.

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.962
It's all changed now.

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:19.605
Maybe the kids have changed too.

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:24.923
All the things I've
taught and believed in.

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:30.482
I don't know if I'm still
doing much good here.

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.961
I better get some sleep.

01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:57.700
Is this mine?

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:00.810
Who else's would it be?
Of course it's yours.

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.940
How do I look?

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:06.005
- Real cool, man. Real cool.
- Thank you.

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.500
- Oh, my gosh. Okay, I'm dying, I'm dying.
- Thank you again.

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:13.020
Get dressed. Let's go to the game.

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.500
De La Salle staged a
miraculous comeback...

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:19.220
for an unprecedented 13th shot
at the sectional championship.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.060
On the line for running back Chris
Ryan is a personal quest...

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:27.490
as he takes the field only three
touchdowns away from breaking a record.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:32.620
Let us begin.
Our father, who art in heaven...

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:34.180
hallowed be thy name.

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:37.980
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
done on earth as it is in heaven.

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.700
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses...

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.380
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:48.060
Lead us not to temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:49.900
- One, two, three.
- Spartans!

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.420
This season is ending with De
La Salle in a familiar place:

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:57.042
Competing for their 13th North
Coast section championship.

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.780
Danny Ladouceur is
slammed to the turf...

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:07.780
but somehow holds on for
a De La Salle first down.

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:11.060
- Yeah, Danny boy!
- Huddle up. Get it to Chris. Let's go.

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:13.500
De La Salle is a favorite
to win this game.

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.522
And most eyes are on Chris Ryan's
quest for a touchdown scoring record.

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:26.940
Yeah!

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.180
Yeah, that's it!
That's it! Way to go.

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:33.260
One down, two to go for the record.
Two more touchdowns for the record.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:36.540
Chris Ryan's historic run at
the state touchdown record...

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:42.085
continues with another touchdown
as De La Salle takes a 7-0 lead.

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:47.125
Pick him up!

01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:51.891
No!

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.060
Why didn't you tackle him?

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:56.260
It is a contact sport.

01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:58.660
You can hit someone.
It's encouraged even.

01:40:58.760 --> 01:40:59.900
Yes!

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.580
With just a little over
five minutes left...

01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:07.442
in the second quarter in this hard-fought
championship, the score is tied, 7-7.

01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:10.460
Beaser, you need to
keep him contained!

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:13.286
Hut, blue one, hut!

01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:15.449
Reverse! Reverse!

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.687
- Contain the runner!
- Contain the runner!

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.020
Amador Valley dips into its bag
of tricks, but Joe Beaser isn't fooled.

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.926
The senior defensive end
played that perfectly.

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:34.700
De La Salle is up 14-7 here
in the fourth quarter.

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:37.860
The Spartans have the ball
on the Dons' 35-yard line.

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:42.802
Chris Ryan is one touchdown away
from tying the state record.

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:46.846
Danny.

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.730
Coach.

01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:51.060
Watch the defensive back.

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:54.380
He leans inside a lot.
When he does, beat him to the corner.

01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:57.620
Give him a hard fake on your
first move. Finish strong.

01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.490
Corner.

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:03.246
Thirty-four, 34. Give it to 34.

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:08.020
Chris, Chris, Chris!

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:10.971
Down. Set, hut!

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.100
- Yeah!
- Chris Ryan won't be denied.

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:30.780
He scores again to give De La Salle
a two-touchdown advantage.

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:34.660
He is now just one touchdown away
from breaking the state record.

01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.291
One more for the record.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.440
Set, hut!

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:46.525
Salinas.

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.460
This is your final
drive as a Spartan.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:51.780
Coach?

01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:54.660
It's yours. You call the plays.

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:58.580
Chris, Chris, Chris!

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:02.260
Strong right, 16 midline
on one. Ready?

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:06.940
Chris, Chris, Chris!

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.846
Down. Set, hut!

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.689
Go, come on!

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:19.483
Come on, block for him!
Give him some help, will you?

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:26.690
Come on!

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:33.402
One more for the record.
Give it to the Beast. Give it to Chris.

01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:40.246
Down.

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.925
Set, hut!

01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:58.690
Booyah, baby!

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:02.860
Hey, good catch, dog.

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:06.820
Come on, come on. There's still time.
Still time. Let's get it to Chris.

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:10.740
Chris, Chris, Chris!

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:13.008
Break that record, son. Let's go.

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.530
Here we go, baby,
41 blast into the record books.

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.380
Here we go.

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:22.445
It's the last play of the game, dog.
Make me proud.

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.724
Time out.

01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:41.449
- What are they doing?
- I don't know. It's their drive.

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:45.180
- What are you doing?
- Coach Lad's doing this for me.

01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:48.290
- He won't say...
- Dude, what are you talking about?

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:53.020
I just... I don't want my last play
as a Spartan to be about me.

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.085
Why not? You trained to
get here, you deserve it.

01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.500
Look, it's an easy shot.

01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:01.140
He never took the easy shot.

01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:03.660
Coming back to coach us,
he could have died.

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:05.620
And what have we done for him?

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:08.924
Won a few games? A championship?

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:12.251
No, he's right.

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:16.740
While we've been staring at the dirt,
coach has been saying look up.

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:19.042
It's about time we did.

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:23.340
It's time for us to stand tall.
Victory formation.

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:26.041
No, no, no. You gotta do it.

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:28.726
All right.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.940
Boys, no matter where we
go or what we achieve...

01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:36.140
nothing's gonna come close
to what we have right here.

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:38.660
You're all my brothers.
Spartans for life.

01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:40.540
Spartans for life.

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:43.684
Shotgun formation, direct snap,
on me, on one. Ready?

01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:47.380
De La Salle is lining up
in shotgun formation...

01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:50.411
but Chris Ryan is quarterback
instead of Salinas.

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:53.700
This is a formation we haven't
seen from De La Salle.

01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:58.700
Look for Ryan to run this in for his
record-setting 89th career touchdown.

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:02.049
Maybe this wasn't the best
time to give Salinas free will.

01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:06.380
Down. Set, hut!

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:09.980
- There's the snap, and Ryan...
- What the hell was that?

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:11.220
...takes a knee.

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:15.100
Wow, rather than running in for
his 89th career touchdown...

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:17.620
Chris Ryan instead
opts to take a knee.

01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:19.524
What are you doing, coach?

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:25.900
Let him run it. Forty-one blast, come on.
There's still time. Run it! Run it!

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.860
- Mickey, Bob's not calling the plays.
- You don't understand football.

01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:31.491
It's not about football.

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:35.140
Your husband is costing
my son this record.

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:37.860
My husband's turning
your son into a man.

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:41.767
- You're the only person who doesn't see.
- Down, set, hut!

01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.260
No, no, no. Come on.

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:48.087
- Ryan takes another knee.
- Time out. Stop that clock, Ladouceur.

01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.180
Stop that clock and run that play.

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:53.131
Run the play!
Let him get the record! Come on!

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:28.500
What could've been a record-shattering
night has now turned into a tribute...

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:32.771
to the man who took them here,
Coach Bob Ladouceur.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.020
- Why didn't that boy get his record?
- Because it's not about the record.

01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.380
- Nine, eight, seven, six...
- It's about the team.

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:10.900
...five, four...

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.602
three, two, one.

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:19.171
Yeah!

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.725
For you.

01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:37.651
Come here.

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:51.409
DLS, DLS, DLS!

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:30.620
Remember one other thing:

01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:35.140
Nobody on this staff expects
you to play perfect tonight.

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:38.220
That's impossible.
But what we do expect...

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:41.620
and you should expect from
yourself and each other...

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.968
is a perfect effort.

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:53.523
I'll say this about Bob Ladouceur...

01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:59.820
that he's a better coach than
our big-time college coaches...

01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:03.886
and he's a better coach than
our big-time pro coaches.

01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.766
Everybody stands up as an individual
and says, "My name is DJ Williams.

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:19.580
I commit to 20 carries, 150 yards,
seven tackles and no dropped passes."

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:23.740
Once you say that, you hand the card
to somebody, and you shake hands...

01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.646
and they say, "I hold you
to that commitment."

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:35.580
To the Kelly family,
Landrin and Bevelyn.

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:41.091
My heart breaks for your loss,
and I pray for your recovery.

01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:43.500
God bless you both...

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:47.500
and please, take some
solace in the fact...

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:51.009
that you did a fantastic job.

01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:05.380
I told you before, this is the
last thing I'm gonna say.

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:08.380
Growing up is painful.

01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:11.001
It's not easy.

01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:16.085
But that's what our program is about,
in case you haven't figured it out.

01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:18.780
It ain't about the football.

01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:21.820
It ain't about scoring touchdowns.

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:24.060
It ain't about the win streak.

01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:26.931
It's about moving
you in a direction...

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:32.008
that will assist you
and help you grow up.

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:35.380
So when you can take your place...

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:39.260
out in the world, and out in society,
and out in our community...

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:43.620
you can be depended on.

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.126
Lad said it. He goes:

01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:48.340
"You know, if, you know,
Terry wasn't on my staff...

01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:50.620
I wouldn't be doing this right now."

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:54.340
There's a tremendous bond of
trust and friendship that's there.

01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:56.740
They share a commitment
to their players.

01:51:56.840 --> 01:52:00.820
No matter what's going on,
the players come first...

01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:02.660
and that means the team.

01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:05.860
They will never sacrifice the
team for the individual.

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:08.540
And all they wanna do
is create a community...

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:11.446
have a common goal,
and play the game.

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:21.460
We're De La Salle.
Some guys wanna call it a curse...

01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:24.060
I say that's the blessing
of De La Salle.

01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:26.420
You gotta go out every
week and prove it.

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:31.740
So when you show up tomorrow,
whatever it is that excites you...

01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:36.700
whatever it is that's gonna get you
to bring your A-game and your A-heart...

01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:39.140
you bring it and you do it.

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:43.340
I don't know what that is for you.
What is it that gets your heart swollen.

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:46.780
Hopefully, it's gonna be that
last chapter in the book...

01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:50.050
that you've written for
yourself this year.

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:56.180
And I'd like to say, I'd like to just
call that last chapter just what...

01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:58.140
Just what Coach Eidson called it.

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:04.260
Last chapter of the book isn't
the NCS 3A title or San Leandro.

01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:06.439
It's "Brotherhood."

01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:08.847
That's what it should be titled.
