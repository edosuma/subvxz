WEBVTT

00:06.417 --> 00:08.485
How about "Matt"?

00:08.487 --> 00:09.919
Matt? No.

00:09.921 --> 00:11.488
No, not Matt,
not a shot.

00:11.490 --> 00:12.589
What is wrong
with Matt?

00:12.591 --> 00:13.823
Baby, "Matt"
rhymes with "fat."

00:13.825 --> 00:16.091
He's gonna get made fun of
the first day of pre-K.

00:16.094 --> 00:18.261
And his name has
to have, like...

00:18.263 --> 00:20.163
I don't know,
significance, you know?

00:20.165 --> 00:22.098
Someone that
he can look up to.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.867
Someone like
Jeter.

00:23.869 --> 00:25.869
Very funny.
Come on.

00:25.871 --> 00:27.771
Jeter would be nice.

00:27.773 --> 00:30.006
How about Mike?

00:32.076 --> 00:33.877
Really?
You'd name him...

00:33.879 --> 00:35.178
you'd name him
after me?

00:35.180 --> 00:38.748
Well, you said someone
that he can look up to.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.817
I can't think of a better
role model than you.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.486
You're up, Moses.

00:43.488 --> 00:45.155
What did I do
to deserve you?

00:45.157 --> 00:46.256
Come on, bro.
Nothing.

00:46.258 --> 00:47.490
You got lucky.

00:47.492 --> 00:48.691
Yeah, I got
damn lucky.

00:49.561 --> 00:50.794
Hey!

00:50.796 --> 00:51.795
Hey!

00:55.900 --> 00:57.767
Hey. Baby.

00:57.769 --> 00:58.935
Steph...

00:58.937 --> 01:00.069
Sweetheart.

01:00.071 --> 01:01.471
Hey, can you hear me?

01:01.473 --> 01:02.605
Steph...

01:02.607 --> 01:04.774
Hey, somebody help!

01:04.775 --> 01:06.709
Somebody help us!

01:06.711 --> 01:08.711
Somebody call 911!

01:08.713 --> 01:09.879
Hey.

01:09.881 --> 01:11.181
Somebody help!

01:13.385 --> 01:15.185
Yeah, what's up now?

01:16.488 --> 01:17.887
Got knocked out, right?

01:17.889 --> 01:19.689
Uh, yeah, what's up?

01:24.129 --> 01:25.528
Yeah, I told you,

01:25.530 --> 01:26.830
bro, I'm ready.

01:26.832 --> 01:29.098
Let's see you walk
the dog now, huh?

01:36.407 --> 01:38.374
Tonight's attack
makes three this week

01:38.376 --> 01:40.343
and an even dozen
in the last month.

01:40.345 --> 01:41.344
Pattern?

01:41.346 --> 01:42.545
Chief Helfond?

01:43.515 --> 01:44.514
The incidents are centralized

01:44.516 --> 01:46.816
in Brooklyn and Queens,
mostly at night,

01:46.818 --> 01:49.586
all within a two-block range
of a subway stop.

01:49.588 --> 01:51.087
We're not sure that's a factor,

01:51.089 --> 01:52.889
whether it's a home game
or an away game.

01:52.891 --> 01:55.658
Video surveillance footage
in nearby stations?

01:55.660 --> 01:56.559
Inconclusive.

01:56.561 --> 01:59.329
All right,
so what we know is...?

01:59.331 --> 02:00.763
That this knockout game

02:00.765 --> 02:03.233
is just the kind of
random urban nightmare

02:03.235 --> 02:04.934
that gooses the 11:00 news

02:04.936 --> 02:06.469
and scares the tourists
back to Indiana.

02:06.471 --> 02:07.704
Which is why

02:07.706 --> 02:09.439
the mayor's office is...
We will deal with

02:09.441 --> 02:11.307
the chamber of commerce issues
in due time.

02:11.309 --> 02:12.876
Not our clock to set.

02:16.114 --> 02:17.547
What we know:

02:17.549 --> 02:18.815
it's not
about money;

02:18.817 --> 02:20.450
not one victim was robbed.

02:20.452 --> 02:22.986
Or sex--
there's no sexual assault

02:22.988 --> 02:25.488
attached to any
of the incidents.

02:25.490 --> 02:27.957
Did any of the victims
know their assailants?

02:27.959 --> 02:28.925
Not that we know of.

02:28.927 --> 02:31.594
So it's not revenge, either.

02:34.465 --> 02:37.634
All of the victims are white.

02:37.636 --> 02:39.903
All of the assailants are black.

02:39.905 --> 02:41.070
Yes, so far.

02:41.072 --> 02:42.472
Walks like a hate crime,

02:42.474 --> 02:43.773
talks like a hate crime.

02:46.076 --> 02:47.410
We can call this
whatever we want.

02:47.412 --> 02:49.545
We're going to call it
what it is.

02:49.547 --> 02:50.947
They post the footage

02:50.949 --> 02:52.482
on the Web,

02:52.484 --> 02:53.549
like it's their highlight reel.

02:53.551 --> 02:55.785
So it's also a social
media phenomenon.

02:55.787 --> 02:57.186
So a copycat profile.

02:57.188 --> 02:59.322
In the '80s
we called it "wilding."

02:59.324 --> 03:02.358
Scores of teenagers
rushing through subway cars,

03:02.360 --> 03:03.726
knocking people
to the ground,

03:03.728 --> 03:06.329
snatching whatever
they could get their hands on

03:06.331 --> 03:07.897
like bats out of hell.

03:07.899 --> 03:09.799
Took people years
to get over that.

03:11.436 --> 03:13.169
Where we start:

03:13.171 --> 03:14.871
in the communities,

03:14.873 --> 03:16.839
with our confidential
informants.

03:16.841 --> 03:18.641
What are we offering in return?

03:18.643 --> 03:21.544
Look, this kind of
stupid, random brutality

03:21.546 --> 03:23.579
gives regular street crime
a bad name.

03:23.581 --> 03:25.848
Let's appeal to
the sense of pride

03:25.850 --> 03:27.617
in the professional criminal.

03:27.619 --> 03:28.985
That's all for now.

03:36.627 --> 03:38.528
Could you see their faces,
Mr. Rose?

03:38.530 --> 03:40.163
It was dark.

03:40.165 --> 03:41.164
Okay.

03:41.166 --> 03:43.533
How about, uh, their clothes?

03:43.535 --> 03:44.734
Anything unusual?

03:44.736 --> 03:47.337
Any easily identifiable
pieces of clothing?

03:47.339 --> 03:50.006
No. Do you know how much longer
they're going to be in there?

03:50.008 --> 03:52.241
The doctor said he'd come see us
as soon as he could.

03:52.243 --> 03:54.310
I know, but they've been in there
a long time with her, you know?

03:54.312 --> 03:56.012
I'm sure they're
doing their best.

03:57.881 --> 03:59.549
Could you tell
how tall they were?

03:59.551 --> 04:01.317
Tall, short, average?

04:01.319 --> 04:02.485
Anything?

04:02.487 --> 04:04.587
I don't know.

04:04.589 --> 04:06.856
Was one of them
bigger than the other?

04:06.858 --> 04:09.192
Um... yeah.

04:09.194 --> 04:10.760
Maybe. Honestly, I don't really
remember too much, you know?

04:10.762 --> 04:12.528
Everything happened so fast,
and the three of them

04:12.530 --> 04:13.963
just came out of
nowhere, you know?

04:13.965 --> 04:15.331
Three of them?

04:15.333 --> 04:16.599
You said there were two of them.

04:16.601 --> 04:17.867
Yeah, yeah. No.

04:17.869 --> 04:19.469
Um, I just... I don't know.

04:19.471 --> 04:20.903
Look, I just want
to see Stephanie, you know?

04:20.904 --> 04:22.305
I think... I think
that she needs me,

04:22.307 --> 04:23.506
my baby needs me.

04:23.508 --> 04:24.774
Your wife's pregnant?

04:24.776 --> 04:26.175
Yes.

04:26.177 --> 04:27.443
Our first. Six months.

04:27.445 --> 04:28.444
A little boy.

04:28.446 --> 04:29.445
Mr. Rose?

04:29.447 --> 04:30.747
Yeah, doctor, hey.
How's she doing?

04:30.749 --> 04:31.748
Hey.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.583
Your wife's doing fine.
Okay.

04:33.585 --> 04:34.684
She's stabilized

04:34.686 --> 04:36.452
and is responding
favorably.

04:37.689 --> 04:38.621
Thank God.

04:38.623 --> 04:40.156
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.

04:40.158 --> 04:41.591
And my baby?

04:41.593 --> 04:45.294
Um... maybe you
should have a seat.

Good morning.

05:31.951 --> 05:33.050
Hey.

05:33.052 --> 05:34.418
Keep your coat on.
We gotta go.

05:34.420 --> 05:35.552
I just got here.

05:35.554 --> 05:36.920
Can I get a cup of coffee?

05:38.523 --> 05:40.424
There's nothing
in here.

05:40.426 --> 05:42.159
Exactly.
That's our entire case.

05:42.161 --> 05:43.593
Nothing came back from
the canvass last night?

05:43.618 --> 05:43.977
No.

05:43.978 --> 05:46.378
Cops knocked on every door,
nobody saw a thing.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.113
And we got bupkus from
surveillance cameras.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.281
And our witness can't
give us a description.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.784
Exactly, which is why
we got zero. Come on.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.419
Well, where
are we going?

05:54.421 --> 05:56.020
We're gonna go see
Third-Person Thorpe.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.322
Third-Person
Thorpe?

05:57.324 --> 05:58.490
Who's that,
a cartoon character?

05:58.492 --> 05:59.624
No, he's my CI.

05:59.626 --> 06:00.892
He runs the
Heights.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.427
If anything happened
up there, believe me,

06:02.429 --> 06:04.929
Third-Person Thorpe's
gonna know about it.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.899
Hi. I'm running a bit late,
so can you call

06:07.901 --> 06:10.902
counsel for Richard Jennings
and push a half an hour?

06:10.904 --> 06:14.572
Um... I will need my notes
for that meeting,

06:14.574 --> 06:16.241
so if you could
e-mail them to me...

06:16.243 --> 06:17.976
Oh.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.477
Okay, I'll just, uh,

06:19.479 --> 06:21.246
take a look at those... ow!

06:21.248 --> 06:24.048
...take a look at them
on my way in.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.617
Could you just
hold on for a second?

06:27.053 --> 06:28.787
It's 8:30.
We're going to be late.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.524
I'm back. Um...

06:32.526 --> 06:34.292
you might have
to cancel my lunch.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.960
I think that's it.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.128
All right?

06:37.130 --> 06:39.097
I'll see you soon.

06:42.968 --> 06:44.669
You almost done?

06:47.206 --> 06:49.474
Hello?

06:49.476 --> 06:50.608
Jack...

06:50.610 --> 06:51.910
Hey, what's going on?

06:51.912 --> 06:54.546
You said you would
be out of here by 8:30.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.214
Yeah, I'm almost done.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.018
What if Nicky comes home?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.653
She slept out at a friend's.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.688
I know, but what if
she forgot something?

07:03.690 --> 07:05.356
What if she stops here
on the way to school?

07:05.358 --> 07:07.692
What if...
What if, what if, what if.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.861
What if you got in here with me?

07:09.863 --> 07:12.397
I'm not kidding, Jack.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.399
Yeah, neither am I.

07:14.401 --> 07:15.600
Come here.
What... oh, my God!

07:15.602 --> 07:17.235
I still have
my robe on.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.503
Let me fix that.
Jack.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.104
Jack...
Just like that.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.140
Oh, my God!

07:22.142 --> 07:24.242
Oh...
It just comes undone.

07:30.382 --> 07:31.716
Top o' the morning to you,
Thorpe.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.885
Hey!

07:33.887 --> 07:35.253
Well, if it ain't J Edgar?

07:35.255 --> 07:37.522
Hoover was FBI.
How many times I gotta tell you?

07:37.524 --> 07:38.656
Thorpe knows what Thorpe knows--

07:38.658 --> 07:40.492
a cop's a cop's... a cop.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.960
Detective Baez.
I'm Hoover's partner.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.596
Well, a friend oJ Edgar's
is a friend of Thorpe.

07:45.898 --> 07:46.931
Hey.
Oh...

07:46.933 --> 07:48.766
Come on, knock it off.
Get in there.

07:48.768 --> 07:50.702
We're here for business.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.036
So how can
Thorpe help you?

07:52.038 --> 07:53.371
You been watching the news?

07:53.373 --> 07:55.006
The latest victim
of the knockout game

07:55.008 --> 07:57.208
was a pregnant woman
just a few blocks from here.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.409
Terrible, terrible.

07:58.411 --> 07:59.511
Senseless.

07:59.513 --> 08:00.812
They just said
she lost the baby.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.780
Yeah, she did.
And that's why we're here.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.449
Somebody's got to pay
for this, Thorpe. - Oh...

08:04.451 --> 08:06.751
J Edgar... now, you know

08:06.753 --> 08:08.319
Thorpe is a businessman.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.655
That knockout game
is for punk kids

08:10.657 --> 08:12.023
with no
self-respect,

08:12.025 --> 08:13.191
you know... no ambition.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.893
Yeah, but if a pigeon
takes a dump

08:14.895 --> 08:15.860
up in this neighborhood,

08:15.862 --> 08:17.028
Thorpe's gonna know about it,

08:17.030 --> 08:19.297
isn't he?

08:19.299 --> 08:20.665
You flatter me, J Edgar.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.935
But, uh, Thorpe-Thorpe's
in the dark on this one, man.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.238
I'll tell you what, though...

08:27.240 --> 08:28.339
Thorpe'll ask around for you.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.340
How's that?

08:29.342 --> 08:30.642
Yeah, that's not good enough.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.210
What Thorpe supposed to do?

08:32.212 --> 08:34.645
I mean, he can't know
what he don't know, you know?

08:34.648 --> 08:38.216
Well, maybe we'll just jog
Thorpe's memory then, huh?

08:41.620 --> 08:43.587
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
what are you doing?

08:43.590 --> 08:45.924
Searching the apartment.
For drugs.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.625
This isn't even
Thorpe's place, man.

08:47.627 --> 08:48.760
It's-it's my girl's.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.362
Well, then, we'll be sure
to keep it neat.

08:52.831 --> 08:54.566
- Just sit there.
- J Edgar, come on, man.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.601
Y-You know you can't do that
without a warrant, baby.

08:56.603 --> 08:59.671
You gave up those rights
when you got paroled, my friend.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.474
Danny!

09:08.213 --> 09:09.914
ll, look at that.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.449
Yo, that ain't
Thorpe's.

09:11.451 --> 09:13.084
It's felony weight, Thorpe.

09:14.019 --> 09:15.086
You want to tell me

09:15.088 --> 09:16.187
who's running
the knockout game now?

09:16.189 --> 09:18.089
J Edgar, come on, man.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.357
That ain't even half a gram.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.592
You know
Thorpe'll bounce

09:20.594 --> 09:22.927
in 36 hours on
a half a gram, man.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.128
That's true.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.196
Hmm.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.798
I mean, you could
probably d36 hours

09:26.800 --> 09:27.765
standing on your head, huh?

09:27.767 --> 09:29.300
No doubt!

09:29.302 --> 09:30.735
No doubt,
indeed.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.869
But tell me something:

09:31.871 --> 09:33.071
could your girlfriend
do that time

09:33.073 --> 09:34.238
standing on her head?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.840
Oh, J Edgar, don't even
play like that, man.

09:36.843 --> 09:37.742
Cuff her.

09:37.744 --> 09:38.810
Papi!

09:38.812 --> 09:40.211
Get up, come on, let's go.
But...

09:40.213 --> 09:42.180
Aw, hell no.
No, you can't do that.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.448
Up.
Get your hands off me!

09:43.450 --> 09:44.649
Get up.
What are you doing?

09:44.651 --> 09:46.784
The apartment is legally
registered in her name,

09:46.786 --> 09:48.620
which makes the drugs
technically hers.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.821
Her drugs, her collar.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.255
Get your hands off me.
Wait, hold up, hold up.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.624
Just... that's not necessary.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.825
Thorpe, get her off me.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.026
Okay, I'll talk.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.061
I'll talk.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.364
Willie Hayward.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.832
My cousin.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.868
That's the dummy running
the knockout game around here.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.471
Cut her loose.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.206
Why you gotta
make things so difficult?

10:09.209 --> 10:11.042
The knockout game is news.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.277
I try and push the press
to sit on new incidents,

10:13.279 --> 10:14.879
that's censorship.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.181
And "news" and
"censorship"

10:17.183 --> 10:18.616
in the same sentence gets me,

10:18.618 --> 10:20.018
and by extension you,

10:20.020 --> 10:21.252
hung by the rafters.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.521
You're not actually
trying to frame this

10:23.523 --> 10:25.890
as a freedom-of-the-press issue?
Not just me...

10:25.892 --> 10:27.892
Because A.J. Liebling was right:

10:27.894 --> 10:30.628
"Freedom of the press is limited
to those who own one."

10:30.630 --> 10:31.896
Is that supposed to be funny?

10:31.898 --> 10:33.898
Invite them in.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.268
Invite them to stop publicizing
this stupid "game."

10:37.270 --> 10:38.770
Invite them to have a hand

10:38.772 --> 10:42.607
in possibly sparing
some old lady a broken jaw

10:42.609 --> 10:44.275
instead of giving these animals

10:44.277 --> 10:45.710
another 15 minutes of fame.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.211
I'll send out the invitations,

10:47.213 --> 10:49.313
but I wouldn't book
the hall just yet.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.183
What's this?

10:55.521 --> 10:56.721
Okay.

10:57.890 --> 11:00.525
Baker!

11:00.527 --> 11:01.693
What's this?

11:01.695 --> 11:03.227
Sir?

11:03.229 --> 11:05.329
How did it get on my desk?

11:05.331 --> 11:06.564
Which?

11:06.566 --> 11:08.366
This.

11:10.836 --> 11:15.707
At Deputy Commissioner Moore's
request, sir.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.410
Thank you, Baker.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.256
You don't really expect me
to sign this.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.358
Let me give you the background.
It landed on my desk...

11:34.360 --> 11:37.528
First of all, please go do
the job you're paid to do.

11:38.931 --> 11:41.199
That's all for now.

11:42.534 --> 11:44.869
Thank you.

12:01.353 --> 12:03.788
You got Hayward's mug shot
over there?

12:07.693 --> 12:08.960
What do you think?

12:08.962 --> 12:13.197
Close, but it's too grainy
to make a positive ID.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.032
I think it's still worth
having a talk with him, though.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.635
Let's go.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.046
Can I help you?

12:29.048 --> 12:31.382
Yeah, looking for this guy,
Willie Hayward.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.950
You seen him around?

12:32.952 --> 12:33.818
Don't know him.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.653
Take a closer look, tough guy.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.557
Sorry. Never seen him before.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.392
Sure, you haven't.

12:43.495 --> 12:45.496
Reagan?

12:46.098 --> 12:46.998
Hey!

12:54.440 --> 12:56.640
Hey!

12:58.844 --> 12:59.977
You Willie Hayward?

12:59.979 --> 13:01.578
My name is
"I want a lawyer""

13:01.580 --> 13:02.846
Yeah? You like knocking
people out, huh?

13:02.848 --> 13:04.048
Lawyer, lawyer,
lawyer, lawyer, lawyer.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.215
Yeah, you'll
get your lawyer,

13:05.217 --> 13:06.684
but you're gonna do
something for me first.

13:06.686 --> 13:07.818
Yeah? What's that?

13:07.820 --> 13:10.454
Take a lie detector test.
What?!

13:10.456 --> 13:12.256
You might be dumb,
but you're not deaf. Get in.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.824
Hey, hey,
what are you doing, man?

13:13.826 --> 13:16.093
You can't do this to me.
What are you doing?

13:16.095 --> 13:17.895
Hey, stop, come on!

13:17.897 --> 13:20.030
- You guys can't do this to me!
- Whoa!

13:20.032 --> 13:21.031
Oh, squirrel!

13:22.802 --> 13:24.201
What about now?
You hear anything?

13:24.203 --> 13:25.402
Okay, okay, okay,
I'll talk! I'll talk!

13:25.404 --> 13:26.870
I think I heard "uncle."

13:26.872 --> 13:28.772
Come on, let me out!
I think you're right.

13:37.282 --> 13:40.284
Hi, there.
Should I fix us a drink?

13:41.119 --> 13:43.087
Maybe in a minute.

13:48.026 --> 13:49.493
What's this?

13:52.464 --> 13:54.498
Oh, come on, Francis.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.433
Get down off your high horse.

13:56.435 --> 13:59.436
You already asked me about it,
and I already said no.

13:59.438 --> 14:00.571
Yeah, you said no.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.239
That's one vote,
it's not a landslide.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.608
It is in this instance.

14:04.610 --> 14:07.811
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

14:07.813 --> 14:11.815
You enlisted the help of my DCPI
in an effort

14:11.817 --> 14:12.983
to carry out something

14:12.985 --> 14:15.419
I specifically told you
I was against.

14:15.421 --> 14:19.857
Timothy Doherty is a superstar
sitting on the bench.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.825
He deserves the promotion

14:21.827 --> 14:24.161
for the good
of your whole department.

14:24.163 --> 14:25.863
<i>Your</i> whole department.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.365
That's not the issue.

14:28.367 --> 14:31.668
The issue is his name
is on my desk

14:31.670 --> 14:35.205
because his old man
is a drinking buddy of yours.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.941
And so what the hell is so bad
about that?

14:37.943 --> 14:39.743
I don't work that way!

14:39.745 --> 14:41.478
Well, maybe you ought to.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.581
Pop, I'm not going back
to the last century

14:44.583 --> 14:48.318
where the top spots went
to the guys with hooks.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.521
Nobody's asking you to.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.023
And by the way,
it worked just fine.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.692
No, Pop...

14:55.694 --> 14:57.694
it didn't.

14:57.696 --> 15:03.033
Because it valued greased palms
over an honest rise up.

15:06.204 --> 15:08.005
There's a bottle
of Finnerty's 18

15:08.007 --> 15:09.606
that I'm about
to crack open.

15:09.608 --> 15:12.676
But it was a gift
from the Dohertys,

15:12.678 --> 15:15.546
so I won't pour
you one

15:15.548 --> 15:19.950
lest it might make you choke
on your righteousness.

15:21.286 --> 15:23.921
And consider this:
you haven't once said

15:23.923 --> 15:26.957
that Timmy Doherty isn't right
for the job.

15:27.792 --> 15:29.159
And if raising
him up

15:29.161 --> 15:31.595
because his old man is
a friend of mine is wrong,

15:31.597 --> 15:37.267
isn't keeping him down for
the same reason just as bad?

15:49.614 --> 15:52.049
Come on. Let's go.

15:57.155 --> 15:59.523
I'll process him.
You deal with that.

15:59.525 --> 16:01.458
All right.

16:04.295 --> 16:05.462
Mr. Rose.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.130
Detective.
What can I do for you?

16:07.132 --> 16:08.465
Is that him?

16:08.467 --> 16:11.668
It's a little bit early in
our investigation to know that.

16:11.670 --> 16:12.903
Yeah, but you think that's him?

16:12.905 --> 16:14.404
I don't think anything.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.507
It's best not to jump
to conclusions, you understand?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.308
But he's involved?

16:18.310 --> 16:21.044
Look, Mike, I understand
you're hurting.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.946
You have every right
to be, okay?

16:22.948 --> 16:24.781
But I don't think
it's a good idea

16:24.783 --> 16:26.316
you just popping up
around here unannounced.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.618
I just want to look him
in the eyes

16:27.620 --> 16:29.987
and I want to tell him
what he did to my family.

16:31.723 --> 16:34.258
Why don't we go have
a little talk, okay?

16:34.260 --> 16:36.593
I know you want
someone to pay for this, Mike,

16:36.595 --> 16:37.995
and believe me,
I do, too,

16:37.997 --> 16:40.497
but this is a bad road
you're going down.

16:42.267 --> 16:43.734
Stephanie can't get out of bed.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.236
She's just laying there like
she's in a coma or something.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.805
It's gonna take some time.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.307
A lot of time, I'm afraid.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.744
It took us five years
to get pregnant.

16:56.047 --> 16:57.447
Five.

16:57.449 --> 17:00.417
You have any idea what a miracle
it was that that even happened?

17:00.419 --> 17:03.020
Ten rounds
of in vitro.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.455
I had to stick a needle in her
stomach every single morning.

17:08.059 --> 17:09.326
It was round after round

17:09.328 --> 17:10.928
after round
of the same thing.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.530
The embryo didn't take.

17:13.531 --> 17:17.300
Six months ago, a little miracle
happened, you know?

17:17.303 --> 17:22.772
God shined his light on us,
Detective.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.809
That's what we told ourselves.
And for what?

17:25.810 --> 17:29.112
And for what, so they could
just go and do this?

17:30.281 --> 17:31.882
He's gonna give us a baby

17:31.884 --> 17:34.418
so he can just to take it away
from us? That's...

17:34.420 --> 17:36.820
What kind of God does something
sick like that to people?

17:36.822 --> 17:39.156
I don't know the answer to that.

17:57.014 --> 17:59.282
You're messed up in the head,
you know that?

17:59.284 --> 18:02.151
Stick somebody in a trunk
and drive around like that?

18:02.153 --> 18:03.586
You nuts, man.

18:03.588 --> 18:06.055
Almost as nuts as running around
punching innocent strangers

18:06.057 --> 18:07.857
in the face for giggles, huh?

18:09.259 --> 18:11.260
Is that you?

18:12.095 --> 18:14.030
Maybe, maybe not.

18:14.032 --> 18:16.933
You want to go back in the trunk?
No, no!

18:16.935 --> 18:18.367
Okay, it's me.

18:18.369 --> 18:21.103
The guy on the bike, what'd
he do to you? Did he rob you,

18:21.105 --> 18:22.638
call your mother a name, what?
No.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.073
So why'd you punch him
in the face?

18:24.075 --> 18:25.675
I don't know. It's a game.

18:25.677 --> 18:28.544
A game? The guy's got his
jaw broken in two places.

18:28.546 --> 18:29.879
He can't work for a month.

18:29.881 --> 18:32.248
He's got no way to take care
of his kids. Some game.

18:32.250 --> 18:33.316
He was a punk, man.

18:33.318 --> 18:34.884
No, you're a punk, man.

18:37.020 --> 18:39.555
Tell me what happened
two nights ago.

18:39.557 --> 18:41.824
Two nights ago? I didn't do
nothing two nights ago.

18:41.826 --> 18:43.826
I'm not screwing around
with you, Hayward.

18:43.828 --> 18:46.128
I got a pregnant woman
who can't get out of bed

18:46.130 --> 18:47.830
and probably never
will again, because

18:47.832 --> 18:49.699
you knocked her out
and killed her baby

18:49.701 --> 18:50.900
all for a freaking laugh!

18:50.902 --> 18:52.735
I didn't do nothing
two nights ago, okay?

18:52.737 --> 18:54.237
I didn't hit nobody!
I didn't hit no lady!

18:54.239 --> 18:56.305
You know what?
Forget the trunk.

18:56.307 --> 18:57.874
We'll try the roof
this time.

18:57.876 --> 18:59.475
Yo, I'm not messing
with you, man!

18:59.477 --> 19:00.576
I'm telling the truth.

19:00.578 --> 19:03.312
I was at the Knick game
that night with my boys.

19:04.781 --> 19:06.749
Better hope you and your boys
somehow ended up

19:06.751 --> 19:07.917
on the kissing cam.

19:07.919 --> 19:09.719
Check my phone.

19:09.721 --> 19:11.320
They played the Bobcats
that night.

19:11.322 --> 19:13.289
Okay, let's look at your phone.

19:14.391 --> 19:15.758
That's me.

19:15.760 --> 19:18.027
I see it's you, dummy.

19:22.332 --> 19:25.501
"8:20."

19:25.503 --> 19:28.204
That's ten minutes before
Stephanie got hit. Lucky you.

19:28.206 --> 19:30.439
Told you I'm innocent.

19:30.441 --> 19:31.908
Sit your ass down.

19:37.547 --> 19:40.583
You're still going down
for the other knockouts...

19:40.585 --> 19:42.551
tough guy.

19:55.365 --> 19:56.899
Got a minute?

19:56.901 --> 20:00.536
My time is all yours
to take up, as you know.

20:00.538 --> 20:01.904
All right.

20:01.906 --> 20:03.940
I want to apologize for getting
into this with your father

20:03.942 --> 20:06.475
and attempting the end run
around you. It was out of line.

20:06.477 --> 20:08.311
Yes, it was.
It won't happen again.

20:08.313 --> 20:09.812
Then let's put this behind us.

20:09.814 --> 20:11.547
Fine by me.

20:11.549 --> 20:13.849
How are you doing
with the media?

20:13.851 --> 20:16.886
But I stand by my decision
to recommend Officer Doherty.

20:16.888 --> 20:19.255
I thought we just agreed
to put this behind us?

20:19.257 --> 20:21.490
Frank, I consider it an
important part of my job

20:21.492 --> 20:22.692
to be straight with you,

20:22.694 --> 20:24.160
for good and for bad.

20:24.162 --> 20:25.963
And the truth is, I put those
promotion papers

20:25.964 --> 20:27.129
on your desk again today.

20:27.131 --> 20:29.131
Are we gonna have
a problem here, Garrett?

20:29.133 --> 20:30.633
We already do.
How's that?

20:30.635 --> 20:33.602
You're very good
at giving advice.

20:33.604 --> 20:36.272
Your counsel is invaluable,
both in this building

20:36.274 --> 20:37.506
and out in the world,

20:37.508 --> 20:38.841
and everyone around you
appreciates it.

20:38.843 --> 20:40.710
But it's a one-way street
with you, Frank.

20:40.712 --> 20:42.511
It is not.
It is, too!

20:42.513 --> 20:43.579
At some point
in your life,

20:43.581 --> 20:45.181
you went up the mountain
and came back down

20:45.183 --> 20:47.950
with your own tablets of what is
and is not the right thing

20:47.952 --> 20:49.251
to do, written in stone.

20:49.253 --> 20:53.289
Which allows for certainty
but not always wisdom.

21:02.332 --> 21:04.867
Two media outlets agreed
not to sensationalize

21:04.869 --> 21:07.269
any further events
on the knockout game.

21:07.271 --> 21:08.938
That's a start.

21:08.940 --> 21:11.574
The <i>Jewish Daily Forward</i>
and <i>The Village Voice.</i>

21:11.576 --> 21:14.677
A slow start, but a start.

21:14.679 --> 21:15.878
I have a conference call

21:15.880 --> 21:17.980
with the editors of the <i>Post</i>
in 30 seconds.

21:18.882 --> 21:20.883
Do what you can.

21:20.885 --> 21:22.518
See you later.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.378
Hey, Detective, what's up?

21:49.380 --> 21:52.014
Mike, the guy you saw
down at the squad--

21:52.016 --> 21:53.382
he's not our guy.

21:53.384 --> 21:56.185
We're back
to square one.

21:56.187 --> 21:57.420
Sorry to hear that.

21:57.422 --> 21:59.155
Me, too. You mind if I come in

21:59.157 --> 22:00.689
and pick your brain
a little bit?

22:00.691 --> 22:03.259
Yeah. I'm not sure
how much help I'm gonna be,

22:03.261 --> 22:05.061
but yeah, yeah, sure.
Come in.

22:10.467 --> 22:12.835
I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

22:12.837 --> 22:14.804
You know?
Got to move on, right?

22:16.239 --> 22:18.040
Maybe this'll give me
some of that closure

22:18.042 --> 22:19.742
or whatever it is they call it.

22:19.744 --> 22:23.179
I get it.

22:24.648 --> 22:27.016
Why don't I give you
a hand, Mike?

22:27.018 --> 22:30.386
We can just talk
a little bit.

22:30.388 --> 22:32.288
That is if you're up for
answering a few questions

22:32.290 --> 22:34.223
about the other night?

22:34.225 --> 22:35.825
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I...

22:35.827 --> 22:37.059
I really don't know
how much help I'm gonna be.

22:37.061 --> 22:38.794
Like I said, you know,
what I saw,

22:38.796 --> 22:40.262
I don't really remember much of.

22:40.264 --> 22:42.398
And I didn't see much
to begin with, so...

22:42.400 --> 22:43.866
All right, well,
why don't we start

22:43.868 --> 22:45.668
with how many
of them there were?

22:45.670 --> 22:48.070
Um, there were three of them.

22:48.072 --> 22:50.573
You remember how tall they were?

22:50.575 --> 22:52.041
Taller than you?

22:52.043 --> 22:54.343
Taller, taller, yeah.
One of them was taller.

22:54.345 --> 22:56.278
He was maybe six two.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.214
Okay, what about the other two?

22:58.216 --> 22:59.548
Smaller.

22:59.550 --> 23:00.716
One was really short.

23:00.718 --> 23:04.153
Uh-huh. They have any
identifying characteristics?

23:04.155 --> 23:06.422
Uh, scars, tattoos?

23:06.424 --> 23:08.858
Nah, they were
bundled up pretty good.

23:08.860 --> 23:11.393
Remember their voices at all?
They say anything?

23:11.395 --> 23:12.528
Anything distinct?

23:12.530 --> 23:15.364
Maybe one guy called
another guy's name?

23:15.366 --> 23:17.933
Moses.

23:17.935 --> 23:21.370
Sweetheart, you're up.

23:22.939 --> 23:24.306
Excuse me, Mrs. Rose.

23:24.308 --> 23:26.642
I don't want to be rude,
but you said Moses.

23:26.644 --> 23:28.077
Who's Moses?

23:28.079 --> 23:29.945
Just before they hit me,

23:29.947 --> 23:33.315
I heard someone say,
"You're up, Moses."

23:33.317 --> 23:35.451
You did?

23:37.020 --> 23:38.921
Was the tall one
the one who threw the punch?

23:38.923 --> 23:40.256
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

23:40.258 --> 23:41.390
Why? You know this guy?

23:41.392 --> 23:43.559
I collared a drug dealer
in that neighborhood

23:43.561 --> 23:45.895
a couple of times,
goes by the name of Moses.

23:45.897 --> 23:47.096
And he's a big guy?

23:47.098 --> 23:49.031
He's at least six two.

23:56.473 --> 23:58.974
Moses Caldwell.

23:58.976 --> 24:00.476
Got his first collar
at age nine.

24:00.478 --> 24:02.611
Hell, I even collared him
when he was 11.

24:02.613 --> 24:04.580
19 years old,
he's already been collared

24:04.582 --> 24:07.283
for robbery, larceny,
gun possession.

24:07.285 --> 24:08.951
This doesn't end.

24:08.953 --> 24:10.352
I collared him once for larceny.

24:10.354 --> 24:11.854
I told him
I'd cut him some slack

24:11.856 --> 24:12.888
if he got counseling.

24:12.890 --> 24:14.356
He told me I could
"you know what"

24:14.358 --> 24:16.225
my "you know who" instead.

24:16.227 --> 24:17.760
Reagan, Baez?
Yeah, Sarge.

24:17.762 --> 24:19.562
The want card you dropped
for the knockout attack?

24:19.564 --> 24:20.796
What was his name?

24:20.798 --> 24:21.897
Moses Caldwell.

24:21.899 --> 24:23.566
65 just caught a homicide,

24:23.568 --> 24:24.934
D.O.A. in an alley.

24:24.936 --> 24:27.303
We ID'd him
as one Moses Caldwell.

24:27.305 --> 24:29.271
Your card popped as soon as we
entered him into the system.

24:29.273 --> 24:30.372
Ah, geez.

24:30.374 --> 24:31.440
How'd he go?

24:31.442 --> 24:33.275
Shot in the gut, close range.

24:33.277 --> 24:35.911
Well, I guess he paid
the ultimate price this time.

24:35.913 --> 24:38.814
Where you going?
Oh, I got to go tie a toe tag.

24:43.620 --> 24:44.942
Are you the one
that found him, Sarge?

24:44.967 --> 24:45.689
Yeah.

24:45.690 --> 24:48.557
Got a call from a guy
who lives up above.

24:48.559 --> 24:50.426
Complainant said he saw
a body in the alley.

24:50.428 --> 24:52.328
So, we checked it out.

24:52.330 --> 24:53.429
Take a look.

24:53.431 --> 24:55.231
Found this.

24:55.233 --> 24:56.966
That'll be Moses, all right.

24:56.968 --> 24:58.867
We hear Moses may have been
in a beef

24:58.869 --> 25:00.936
with another dealer
in the neighborhood?

25:00.938 --> 25:02.938
Moses beefed with everybody.

25:02.940 --> 25:04.907
Anyone in particular?

25:04.909 --> 25:06.575
You know how it is
when these corner boys

25:06.577 --> 25:08.744
want to start a turf war.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.147
Look, sorry to say it,
but chalk this one up

25:12.149 --> 25:13.649
to a public service homicide.

25:13.651 --> 25:15.084
One wastoid wasting another.

25:15.086 --> 25:17.152
Something up, Reagan?

25:17.154 --> 25:18.988
Huh? Um, no.

25:18.990 --> 25:21.023
Nah, everything's good.

25:32.403 --> 25:35.138
Officer Timothy Doherty, sir.

25:42.511 --> 25:43.645
As you were.

25:43.647 --> 25:44.979
Please, sit down.

25:47.383 --> 25:49.017
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

25:49.019 --> 25:50.652
Thank you.

25:53.022 --> 25:55.090
I'm afraid I've got
some bad news.

25:55.092 --> 25:57.025
Despite what you've
been lead to believe,

25:57.027 --> 26:00.795
I am not promoting you
to the intelligence division.

26:00.797 --> 26:01.730
Sir...

26:01.732 --> 26:05.066
Your father and my father

26:05.068 --> 26:07.235
are old friends

26:07.237 --> 26:09.370
as you know.

26:09.372 --> 26:12.340
And I think they got it
in their heads

26:12.342 --> 26:15.543
that it was time for you
to move up the ladder.

26:17.146 --> 26:20.381
But if I promote you
because they're buddies,

26:20.383 --> 26:23.218
well...

26:23.220 --> 26:24.552
it's just not right.

26:24.554 --> 26:27.288
I understand completely, sir.

26:27.290 --> 26:28.723
You do?
Yes, sir.

26:28.725 --> 26:30.959
And I want to thank you.

26:30.961 --> 26:32.994
I asked my father
not to pursue this,

26:32.996 --> 26:34.596
but he insisted.

26:35.564 --> 26:37.999
You're not interested
in the promotion?

26:38.001 --> 26:39.968
Oh, it's not that, sir.
I would very much like

26:39.970 --> 26:41.669
to make my way
to the intelligence division,

26:41.671 --> 26:44.606
and I sincerely believe
that I would be an asset,

26:44.608 --> 26:47.208
but not with a hook.

26:47.210 --> 26:50.478
And I was hoping that you, if
anybody, would understand that.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.513
Why me?

26:51.515 --> 26:53.314
Well, your father
was commissioner

26:53.316 --> 26:54.849
before you, and...

26:59.355 --> 27:01.523
And?

27:01.525 --> 27:03.391
That didn't come out right.

27:03.393 --> 27:06.294
And you think I'm here
because I got a leg up.

27:06.296 --> 27:08.329
Permission to open my mouth

27:08.331 --> 27:09.697
to remove my foot, sir?

27:11.600 --> 27:13.168
Permission granted.

27:13.170 --> 27:15.236
What I mean is

27:15.238 --> 27:16.604
I know enough about you to know

27:16.606 --> 27:18.907
that you got here
under your own steam.

27:18.909 --> 27:21.042
And my father says

27:21.044 --> 27:23.244
that you had some reluctance
when asked to step up.

27:23.246 --> 27:26.614
Maybe because you were moving
into your father's job?

27:27.483 --> 27:29.818
Right on both counts.

27:29.820 --> 27:32.020
My point is,
knowing the department,

27:32.022 --> 27:33.755
I'm sure there was
some behind-the-back talk

27:33.757 --> 27:35.757
you had to deal with
about how you had a hook.

27:35.759 --> 27:37.425
And...

27:37.427 --> 27:38.427
that's what I meant about

27:38.428 --> 27:39.994
if anybody'd understand,
you would.

27:41.063 --> 27:42.897
And I do.

27:42.899 --> 27:45.066
I love being a cop, sir.

27:45.068 --> 27:48.036
And, sure, I've got some goals.

27:48.038 --> 27:49.971
Some pretty lofty ones, in fact.

27:49.973 --> 27:53.174
One day hoping it's me
sitting in this office.

27:55.010 --> 27:56.377
But I've got a long way to go,

27:56.379 --> 27:57.846
and I'm enjoying the good work

27:57.848 --> 27:59.314
that's gonna get me there.

28:04.353 --> 28:06.421
Thanks for coming by, Officer.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.590
Thank you, sir.

28:19.102 --> 28:21.569
I'm sorry.
We both know you're dreaming.

28:21.571 --> 28:23.204
I don't think the judge
will agree with you.

28:23.206 --> 28:26.040
I do, and....

28:27.443 --> 28:30.411
I'm sorry.
Can you excuse me for a moment?

28:30.413 --> 28:33.147
Sure.

28:33.149 --> 28:35.216
What are you doing here?

28:35.218 --> 28:36.684
I was in the neighborhood.

28:36.686 --> 28:38.052
Saw these, thought of you.

28:39.688 --> 28:41.823
Gerbera daisies, your favorite.

28:41.825 --> 28:43.224
They're beautiful.

28:43.226 --> 28:45.126
Um, I thought we discussed this.

28:45.128 --> 28:46.594
This is my office.

28:46.596 --> 28:49.931
I don't really feel comfortable
with people knowing about this.

28:49.933 --> 28:51.766
I know, but I got
this idea in my head,

28:51.768 --> 28:53.501
and I just wanted
to share it with you.

28:53.503 --> 28:56.037
And I couldn't help myself.

28:56.039 --> 28:58.873
And you couldn't think
of anyone but yourself?

28:58.875 --> 29:01.643
Okay, I deserve that.

29:01.645 --> 29:03.678
But just hear me out.

29:03.680 --> 29:06.314
About me having to rush out
the other day 'cause of Nicky.

29:06.316 --> 29:07.181
What about it?

29:07.183 --> 29:09.083
What if it wasn't like that?

29:09.085 --> 29:10.852
What if we told her?

29:10.854 --> 29:12.921
Told her what?

29:12.923 --> 29:14.355
About us?

29:14.357 --> 29:16.824
Jack.

29:16.826 --> 29:19.093
Uh, the other day was lovely.

29:19.095 --> 29:21.362
But I think we should
just leave it at that.

29:21.364 --> 29:23.331
And what if I wanted
more than that?

29:23.333 --> 29:24.832
You don't.

29:24.834 --> 29:26.000
You don't know that.

29:26.002 --> 29:27.635
I do.

29:27.637 --> 29:29.237
I know you.

29:30.172 --> 29:32.507
Will you at least
think about it?

29:34.443 --> 29:36.778
Yes.

29:36.780 --> 29:39.347
I-I do need to get back
to that meeting.

29:41.150 --> 29:42.817
Thank you.

29:51.727 --> 29:53.928
Detective?

29:53.930 --> 29:54.963
Evening.

29:54.965 --> 29:57.298
Evening, Detective.
Is everything okay?

29:57.300 --> 29:58.800
Everything's fine.

29:58.802 --> 30:00.902
Just, uh, wondering if I could

30:00.904 --> 30:02.270
steal your husband for a minute?

30:02.272 --> 30:04.505
Yeah.
Uh, uh, yeah, of course.

30:04.507 --> 30:06.774
Yeah...

30:06.776 --> 30:08.242
Yeah.

30:09.545 --> 30:10.578
What's going on?

30:10.580 --> 30:12.447
Officially?

30:12.449 --> 30:13.948
I'm here to tell
you that the guy

30:13.950 --> 30:17.618
who assaulted your
wife is dead.

30:17.620 --> 30:19.120
Wow. Really?

30:19.122 --> 30:21.289
Yeah.

30:21.291 --> 30:24.258
He was killed in an apparent
drug-related turf war.

30:24.260 --> 30:27.595
All right, I should
probably go tell Steph.

30:27.597 --> 30:29.297
She's gonna want to hear this.

30:29.299 --> 30:32.166
I noticed you're not wearing
your work boots tonight, Mike.

30:32.168 --> 30:35.169
No. No, I'm not.

30:36.839 --> 30:39.440
I was thinking
maybe it would be better for you

30:39.442 --> 30:42.577
if they didn't exist anymore.

30:42.579 --> 30:44.946
I saw your boot print
at the scene.

30:50.419 --> 30:52.787
He beat my wife.
He killed my baby.

30:52.789 --> 30:53.803
Don't say another word.

30:53.828 --> 30:55.828
I swear, I just wanted to go
and look him in the eye like I told you.

30:55.859 --> 30:57.892
I swear to you, Detective.
Mike, I'm warning you.

30:57.894 --> 30:58.871
And I didn't want anything
like that to happen...

30:58.896 --> 31:00.896
Just stop talking, Mike!

31:02.831 --> 31:06.000
Look, my heart breaks
for you and your family

31:06.002 --> 31:07.802
and what you've gone through.

31:10.572 --> 31:12.940
But I'm gonna make something
very clear to you.

31:12.942 --> 31:15.476
So I need you to
listen to me, okay?

31:18.113 --> 31:21.482
I am not here to ask you
where you were last night.

31:23.152 --> 31:26.054
But at some point I may have to.

31:38.033 --> 31:40.034
Pass the salt, please.

31:43.138 --> 31:45.039
Unless I'm not supposed
to have any.

31:45.041 --> 31:46.441
Lord knows

31:46.443 --> 31:48.009
you know best, Francis.

31:48.011 --> 31:50.411
It's coming down, Grandpa.

31:55.117 --> 31:56.851
Danny, can you pass me
the roast beef?

31:58.287 --> 32:00.221
Hello? Earth to Dad.

32:00.223 --> 32:01.255
What?

32:01.257 --> 32:02.757
Aunt Erin wants
some more meat.

32:02.759 --> 32:04.792
Oh.

32:04.794 --> 32:07.228
Well, here you go.

32:07.230 --> 32:08.996
Something's on your mind.

32:08.998 --> 32:10.431
It's nothing, Dad.

32:10.433 --> 32:12.300
Yeah, he's been
like this all day.

32:13.702 --> 32:16.304
Just because a case is closed
doesn't mean you have closure.

32:16.306 --> 32:18.706
It's not even my case
I'm thinking about, kid.

32:18.708 --> 32:21.576
Another guy in the squad
caught a tough one, is all.

32:21.578 --> 32:23.544
What's the case?

32:23.546 --> 32:25.246
Homicide.

32:25.248 --> 32:27.181
And this detective
is pretty sure

32:27.183 --> 32:28.683
he knows the guy who did it.

32:29.818 --> 32:30.985
Well, that's good, right?

32:30.987 --> 32:34.722
Yeah, except that
the detective might've

32:34.724 --> 32:37.425
done the same thing
if he was in this guy's shoes.

32:38.594 --> 32:39.494
The murder?

32:39.496 --> 32:40.728
The dead guy,

32:40.730 --> 32:42.864
he's a very bad character.

32:42.866 --> 32:46.267
Career criminal and he killed
this guy's daughter recently.

32:46.269 --> 32:47.502
Oh, my God.

32:47.504 --> 32:48.936
That's awful.
Yeah.

32:48.938 --> 32:50.571
It is awful, but
it doesn't give

32:50.573 --> 32:52.540
anyone the right to
become a vigilante.

32:52.542 --> 32:54.308
I didn't say that.

32:54.310 --> 32:56.410
When society accepts
killing in the streets

32:56.412 --> 32:58.146
without regard for the law,
it's called anarchy.

32:58.148 --> 33:00.281
I know that,
but doesn't someone have

33:00.283 --> 33:02.183
the right to defend
their own family?

33:02.185 --> 33:04.085
And take justice
into their own hands?

33:04.087 --> 33:05.653
I'll tell you this...

33:05.655 --> 33:08.623
any monster who lays a finger
on anybody at this table,

33:08.625 --> 33:11.692
they'd be fertilizer before
the courts could get to 'em.

33:11.694 --> 33:12.894
Grandpa...

33:12.896 --> 33:14.428
Eh...

33:15.731 --> 33:16.998
He's a cop.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.966
He took an oath;
there's no fine print.

33:18.968 --> 33:20.968
He's got to pursue the evidence,
let the courts decide.

33:20.970 --> 33:23.104
Yeah, well,
that's the thing, kid.

33:23.106 --> 33:24.939
There's only one little
piece of evidence

33:24.941 --> 33:26.707
connecting this guy
to the crime.

33:26.709 --> 33:29.577
And if the detective
dumped it, well...

33:29.579 --> 33:31.145
there'd be no case at all.

33:32.714 --> 33:34.715
So now <i>he's</i> committing a crime?

33:35.817 --> 33:38.352
Give him directions
to the East River.

33:39.221 --> 33:41.622
Sounds like this detective--

33:41.624 --> 33:43.925
your friend--

33:43.927 --> 33:47.128
is more interested in
being a judge than a cop.

33:47.130 --> 33:50.565
Maybe it's time for
a career change.

33:51.867 --> 33:53.568
Amen.

33:53.570 --> 33:54.802
Who wants more potatoes?

33:54.804 --> 33:58.306
- I'll take 'em.
- I do.

34:06.715 --> 34:08.282
Detective.

34:08.284 --> 34:09.917
Mike, why don't you
grab your coat?

34:09.918 --> 34:11.686
I need to talk to you
a second out here.

34:11.688 --> 34:13.853
Yeah.

34:16.425 --> 34:18.458
Everything okay?
What's going on?

34:18.460 --> 34:20.027
Sorry to tell you, Mike,
but you're under arrest.

34:20.029 --> 34:22.496
Turn around and put your hands
behind your back. Come on.

34:22.498 --> 34:23.697
For what?

34:23.699 --> 34:25.933
The murder of
Moses Caldwell.

34:27.034 --> 34:28.335
You have the right

34:28.338 --> 34:29.670
to remain silent.

34:29.672 --> 34:31.272
Anything you say
may be used against you

34:31.274 --> 34:32.473
in a court of law.

34:32.475 --> 34:34.609
You have the right
to consult an attorney...

34:45.188 --> 34:46.889
This is Detective
Danny Reagan

34:46.891 --> 34:48.525
taking a statement
from Mike Rose

34:48.527 --> 34:52.428
on seven of April, 2014.

34:52.429 --> 34:54.130
Mr. Rose, can you
tell us what happened

34:54.132 --> 34:55.764
on this past
Thursday evening?

34:55.766 --> 34:57.400
Where should
I start?

34:57.402 --> 35:00.036
From when I left
your house, please.

35:00.038 --> 35:02.038
Okay, um, well,
you came to my house

35:02.040 --> 35:04.440
looking for me
to help identify

35:04.442 --> 35:06.042
the person who
assaulted my wife.

35:06.044 --> 35:07.777
And what did you learn
from that interview?

35:07.779 --> 35:10.513
My wife gave you the name
of the guy who attacked her.

35:10.515 --> 35:11.781
Moses?

35:11.783 --> 35:12.448
Mm-hmm.

35:23.494 --> 35:25.595
During that time,
what did you do?

35:25.597 --> 35:27.931
Well, you mentioned that
Moses was a drug dealer

35:27.933 --> 35:31.167
in the neighborhood where
we were attacked, so...

35:31.169 --> 35:32.969
uh, after my wife
went to bed,

35:32.971 --> 35:34.604
I drove over to
that neighborhood.

35:34.606 --> 35:36.706
You went to look for Moses?

35:36.708 --> 35:37.907
Yes.

35:37.909 --> 35:40.009
And did you
find him?

35:40.011 --> 35:41.010
Mm-hmm.

35:41.012 --> 35:43.213
He was dealing drugs
on the corner.

35:44.782 --> 35:47.050
Did you approach Moses?

35:47.052 --> 35:48.251
No, not immediately.

35:48.253 --> 35:49.652
I waited for him
to be alone.

35:49.654 --> 35:52.856
So, um, he ducked
into a back alley

35:52.858 --> 35:54.057
and I intercepted him.

35:54.059 --> 35:55.058
And why did you do that?

35:55.060 --> 35:56.559
Why'd you intercept him?

35:58.229 --> 36:00.797
He beat my wife in the face

36:00.799 --> 36:02.999
right in front of me.

36:04.602 --> 36:06.302
He knocked her out cold.

36:06.304 --> 36:07.704
I thought that my wife was dead.

36:07.706 --> 36:10.006
He killed my unborn child.

36:10.008 --> 36:11.841
So you were there
to get revenge?

36:11.843 --> 36:13.109
No.

36:13.111 --> 36:14.410
I honestly do not think so.

36:14.412 --> 36:15.812
Okay.

36:15.814 --> 36:18.014
Then why did you
go there, Mike?

36:21.619 --> 36:23.820
I just wanted to
look him in the eye.

36:24.989 --> 36:26.689
I swear, that's all
I wanted to do.

36:26.691 --> 36:27.991
I just wanted to
look him in the eye.

36:27.993 --> 36:30.260
I just wanted him to see me
as a real person.

36:30.262 --> 36:32.161
To know what
he did to me,

36:32.163 --> 36:34.330
to know what he did
to my family.

36:34.332 --> 36:35.665
And did you do that, Mr. Rose?

36:35.667 --> 36:36.599
Yes, I did.

36:36.601 --> 36:38.034
And then what happened?

36:38.036 --> 36:39.402
He pulled a gun on me.

36:40.871 --> 36:42.438
Moses pulled
a gun on you?

36:42.440 --> 36:43.573
What did you do?

36:43.575 --> 36:44.974
We were really close.

36:44.976 --> 36:47.210
I mean, we were probably
about this far apart, so...

36:47.212 --> 36:49.612
I don't know why,
but I just grabbed it.

36:49.614 --> 36:51.281
You took the gun from Moses?
No.

36:51.283 --> 36:52.482
Uh, we both had it.

36:52.484 --> 36:53.650
And we were wrestling,

36:53.652 --> 36:55.018
we wrestled to
the ground,

36:55.020 --> 36:56.653
struggled back and
forth with it,

36:56.655 --> 36:58.221
and then out of nowhere,
it just went off.

36:58.223 --> 37:00.056
And who pulled the trigger?

37:00.058 --> 37:02.292
I honestly don't know--
it just went off.

37:02.294 --> 37:04.560
Was anybody shot?

37:05.930 --> 37:07.463
Yeah.

37:07.465 --> 37:10.333
He was shot
in the stomach.

37:11.101 --> 37:13.536
And that was that.
He was dead.

37:14.873 --> 37:17.073
I'm sorry.

37:18.509 --> 37:20.009
I'm so sorry.

37:21.478 --> 37:23.947
So your "friend" caught
a tough case, huh?

37:23.949 --> 37:24.881
Come on.

37:24.883 --> 37:26.849
He's telling
the truth, sis.

37:28.185 --> 37:29.452
And what about that evidence

37:29.454 --> 37:31.154
that almost found its way
into the East River?

37:31.156 --> 37:33.289
We found his footprint
in the alley,

37:33.291 --> 37:34.824
which puts him at the scene.

37:34.826 --> 37:36.426
And what about the gun?

37:36.428 --> 37:37.727
How do we know your guy Mike

37:37.729 --> 37:39.095
didn't just bring it
to the party?

37:39.097 --> 37:41.764
We found a silver-plated
nine millimeter

37:41.766 --> 37:43.066
in a Dumpster
down the alley

37:43.068 --> 37:44.600
with Moses' prints
all over it.

37:44.602 --> 37:46.169
Same make and model

37:46.171 --> 37:48.805
from Moses' two previous
gun possession collars.

37:48.807 --> 37:50.573
And we got witnesses
in the neighborhood

37:50.575 --> 37:53.109
who confirm that it's
Moses' weapon of choice.

37:53.111 --> 37:55.111
You have a M.E.'s report?

37:55.113 --> 37:56.346
M.E.'s report.

37:56.348 --> 37:59.882
It's consistent with
Mike Rose's story.

37:59.884 --> 38:01.451
The powder burns on
the victim's coat

38:01.453 --> 38:04.220
confirm he was shot
at close range.

38:04.222 --> 38:06.389
Well, what about his record?
Any arrests?

38:06.391 --> 38:07.190
Nothing.

38:07.192 --> 38:08.925
It's a pretty bold move,

38:08.927 --> 38:10.159
going down to that neighborhood

38:10.161 --> 38:13.262
just to look a known
drug dealer in the eye.

38:13.264 --> 38:14.397
Yeah, it was.

38:14.399 --> 38:16.199
Any history of violence, or...

38:16.201 --> 38:17.567
domestic disputes?

38:17.569 --> 38:20.069
No. He's clean.

38:21.805 --> 38:24.140
Okay, well, I'll take it
to the grand jury

38:24.142 --> 38:25.808
and see what they think.

38:25.810 --> 38:28.011
Great.

38:29.646 --> 38:30.847
Well, what do you think?

38:30.849 --> 38:33.216
It doesn't matter what I think.

38:33.218 --> 38:35.084
I just present the evidence.

38:35.086 --> 38:36.486
You present the evidence

38:36.488 --> 38:37.987
and then you make
a recommendation,

38:37.989 --> 38:40.823
which is why I want
to know what <i>you</i> think.

38:43.027 --> 38:45.228
I think it adds up.

38:45.230 --> 38:47.030
And I think Mike and his family

38:47.032 --> 38:48.364
have been through enough.

38:48.366 --> 38:51.300
Thank you.

38:55.472 --> 38:58.174
This was delicious.

38:58.176 --> 38:59.976
Yeah, I remember how much
you loved this restaurant.

38:59.978 --> 39:01.411
I do.

39:01.413 --> 39:03.780
But we used to only come here
when it was a special occasions.

39:03.782 --> 39:05.681
Well, I was hoping that...

39:05.683 --> 39:07.683
tonight could maybe
be one of those.

39:08.719 --> 39:10.720
Right. The Nicky question.

39:10.722 --> 39:12.088
Uh-huh.

39:12.090 --> 39:15.024
You really think we should
be telling her about...

39:15.026 --> 39:16.959
whatever it is
we've been doing?

39:16.961 --> 39:18.694
Only if we want
to keep doing it.

39:18.696 --> 39:19.862
And you do?

39:19.864 --> 39:21.030
Yeah, I do.

39:21.032 --> 39:22.398
Very much so.

39:23.233 --> 39:24.634
I do, too.

39:25.636 --> 39:26.836
And I think you're right.

39:26.838 --> 39:28.704
You... think I'm right?

39:28.706 --> 39:30.006
You never think I'm right.

39:30.008 --> 39:32.075
Well, on this very
rare occasion, you are,

39:32.077 --> 39:33.409
so I think you should enjoy it.

39:37.881 --> 39:40.162
We can tell her tonight when
we get back to the apartment.

39:41.218 --> 39:43.152
You can move back in
over the weekend.

39:48.025 --> 39:49.358
Say again?

39:50.761 --> 39:52.929
Well, we're not going to tell
our daughter that we're dating.

39:52.931 --> 39:54.197
Why not?

39:54.199 --> 39:56.532
Because dating is what you do

39:56.534 --> 39:58.668
when you're getting
to know someone.

39:58.670 --> 40:00.336
We were married.

40:00.338 --> 40:01.804
If we're gonna get
back together,

40:01.806 --> 40:03.906
I assume that you wanted
everything that entails.

40:03.908 --> 40:05.108
Don't you?

40:08.045 --> 40:10.012
Um...

40:10.014 --> 40:11.414
Erin, that's not
what I had in mind.

40:13.184 --> 40:14.784
I know.

40:14.786 --> 40:16.486
You want just the fun stuff.

40:16.488 --> 40:17.453
The easy stuff.

40:17.455 --> 40:19.789
Just like when
we were kids.

40:19.791 --> 40:22.792
You don't want
the adult version,

40:22.794 --> 40:25.194
with the commitments
and responsibilities, do you?

40:28.899 --> 40:31.667
Which is why we are
not gonna tell Nicky

40:31.669 --> 40:35.037
about whatever this was... ever.

40:38.675 --> 40:40.276
Are you breaking up with me?

40:41.378 --> 40:42.845
Yes.

40:42.847 --> 40:45.014
Yes, I am.

40:50.687 --> 40:52.255
Hey.

40:52.257 --> 40:54.957
Stephanie.
Mike.

40:54.959 --> 40:56.726
The grand jury
decided not to indict.

40:56.728 --> 40:58.861
Oh, thank God.

40:58.863 --> 40:59.829
Hey.

40:59.831 --> 41:00.930
Thank you.

41:00.932 --> 41:01.998
Thank you,
Detective,

41:02.000 --> 41:03.399
for everything.

41:03.401 --> 41:05.902
You know this could have gone
either way, right, Mike?

41:05.904 --> 41:07.670
Yeah, I know.

41:09.339 --> 41:11.140
You two going to be all right,
going forward?

41:11.142 --> 41:12.308
Yeah.

41:12.310 --> 41:14.010
Yeah, I think so.

41:14.012 --> 41:15.311
We've been
talking about

41:15.313 --> 41:17.780
maybe trying for
another baby.

41:18.549 --> 41:20.183
That's great.

41:20.185 --> 41:22.251
Well, if you need any help, uh,

41:22.253 --> 41:24.253
painting the nursery again,
you let me know.

41:24.255 --> 41:26.455
Yeah.

41:27.658 --> 41:29.825
Hey.

41:35.465 --> 41:37.166
Got a minute?

41:37.168 --> 41:39.535
My time's all yours to take up.
Oh, cut it out.

41:39.537 --> 41:41.604
What's that?

41:41.606 --> 41:44.674
A bottle of Finnerty's 18.

41:46.710 --> 41:48.978
I thought you had a rule
about booze in the offices.

41:48.980 --> 41:51.480
I do. That's why I hide it
in the bookcase.

41:51.482 --> 41:53.316
Thank you.

41:53.318 --> 41:55.518
You're welcome.

41:56.453 --> 41:58.187
I promoted Officer Doherty.

41:58.189 --> 42:00.423
I heard something about that.

42:00.425 --> 42:03.693
I just wanted to thank you for
bringing him to my attention.

42:03.695 --> 42:04.760
Not me.

42:04.762 --> 42:07.697
I was just carrying water
for Henry.

42:07.699 --> 42:09.832
The truth is,

42:09.834 --> 42:11.167
you saw something in him.

42:11.169 --> 42:12.702
Well, let's hope I'm right.

42:12.704 --> 42:14.904
Actually, <i>I</i> gave him
the promotion.

42:14.906 --> 42:16.138
Let's hope I'm right.

42:16.140 --> 42:18.207
Of course.

42:18.209 --> 42:20.610
I stand corrected.

42:20.612 --> 42:23.279
How is my campaign to kill
freedom of the press going?

42:23.281 --> 42:24.947
The editors at the <i>Post</i>

42:24.949 --> 42:26.616
politely declined
to participate.

42:26.618 --> 42:27.617
Politely?

42:27.619 --> 42:29.185
Well, polite for them.

42:29.187 --> 42:30.119
And...?

42:30.121 --> 42:31.387
I made my case

42:31.389 --> 42:32.588
to all that mattered.

42:32.590 --> 42:33.856
God forbid
there's another incident,

42:33.858 --> 42:34.924
but if there is,

42:34.926 --> 42:36.359
we'll know if
we have friends in this.

42:36.361 --> 42:38.361
All you can do.

42:38.363 --> 42:40.363
Hope springs eternal.

42:40.365 --> 42:41.864
We got CompStat in 20.

42:41.866 --> 42:43.399
I'll see you down there.
