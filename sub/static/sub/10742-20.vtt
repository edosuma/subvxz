22:47.099 --> 22:49.166
  Uh, I'll drop in to see you
        later on today.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.035
         Right. All right.
               Bye.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.302
               Jeannie.
               Jeannie.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.271
   Yes, master.

22:54.306 --> 22:55.572
                Oh, hi, Jeannie.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.775
       I-I just talked to Roger.
        He's feeling wonderful.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.076
Oh, I am so pleased.

22:59.112 --> 23:00.745
              The operation
         was a complete success.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.747
     He's gonna be up and around
         in a couple of days.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.049
I told you. Rasha Houn
is a wonderful surgeon.

23:06.452 --> 23:09.086
           Dr. Rasha Houn didn't
          perform the operation.

23:09.122 --> 23:10.154
     Why not?

23:10.189 --> 23:11.521
                       His, uh--

23:11.557 --> 23:14.058
       His medical certificate
   expired about 2000 years ago.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.193
       They used a staff doctor.
    Oh.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.729
Then I've caused you
all this worry for nothing.

23:18.765 --> 23:19.830
                    Hmm? Oh, no.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.265
              I wouldn't call it
                 for nothing.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.068
                   When I--

23:24.103 --> 23:26.336
          When I remember
  the expression on Roger's face

23:26.372 --> 23:27.838
         when I came at him
         with a scalpel...

23:30.342 --> 23:31.508
               Oh, boy!

23:33.379 --> 23:36.413
       Oh, I am glad
 you are not angry, master.

23:36.448 --> 23:39.516
 Why should I be angry with you?
You were just trying to help me,

23:39.552 --> 23:41.685
            when I said I wanted
              to be a surgeon.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.022
           We all have these
      childhood dreams, Jeannie.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.490
          Mm, we get over them.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.158
            Didn't you ever have
              a childhood dream

23:48.193 --> 23:51.428
    when you were a little girl?
    Oh, yes, master.

23:51.463 --> 23:52.496
              What was it?

23:52.532 --> 23:55.131
      Oh. It was nothing.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.333
           No, no. Tell me.

23:56.369 --> 23:58.368
Well, you will think it's silly.

23:58.404 --> 24:00.104
                   [LAUGHS]
             No. No, I wouldn't.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.972
        I-- I will go
      fix your breakfast.

24:02.008 --> 24:02.973
                    Uh, Jeannie.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.174
        I really want to know.

     what you really wish.

      Really, wha-what is it?

24:17.690 --> 24:20.056
                 Oh. Lie back
              and relax, master.
