[Marie] I left him with his aunt
and a cop, what more do you want?

02:31.943 --> 02:34.154
[Pete] Not them in my house
when I come home.

02:34.237 --> 02:37.157
You and T have been fighting
since we were kids and I'm tired of it.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.118
Jesus. Anything but empty shelves left
in Newport?

02:41.744 --> 02:44.372
There's so many odds and ends
going into this christening.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.541
Even picked us up a couple of hankies.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.377
Figured we'd be bawling our eyes out.
I'll show you what I got inside.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.546
I can't. I gotta get back to work.

02:51.629 --> 02:52.839
You just got here, Petey.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.884
I haven't seen you since yesterday

Haven't slept since then neither,
so don't start.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.881
The one that left the seagull.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.426
So, I need you to go back there with me
so we can talk to him together.

He's a cop, 'Saiah.

'cause I followed him home.

-Tricey, just for a minute.
-We need to talk to him.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.151
I understand. Yes.
Let's just talk for a minute.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.780
What is this?

06:45.863 --> 06:49.826
I brought Pastor here because you're...
you're scaring me, Trice.

06:50.451 --> 06:53.204
No. No, we don't have time
to do this right now.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.664
You're not sleeping, baby.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.792

you aren't eating either.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.592
We could be talking to him
instead of standing here, 'Saiah.

He could be answering our questions!

07:08.344 --> 07:09.679
Questions about what?

07:09.762 --> 07:11.180
What happened to Brenton!

07:11.264 --> 07:13.141
We may never know what happened.

07:14.350 --> 07:17.395
And the only one who might ever know
is God.

07:19.439 --> 07:24.026
God didn't run my son down in the street
and leave him to die.

07:25.361 --> 07:26.612
A man did that.

07:27.780 --> 07:31.534
Latrice, I've seen a lot of people
through this sort of thing.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.579
It's rough,
but the ones who come out of it,

07:35.246 --> 07:37.415
who keep their heads above water,

07:37.498 --> 07:39.542
they lean into Him.

07:39.625 --> 07:45.214
I was in that church singing his praises
while my son was dying in a ditch.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.884
Lean? You want me to lean?

07:48.885 --> 07:53.389
I never prayed for anything harder
in my life than for my son to live.

07:54.056 --> 07:56.934
All the while, somebody else
was praying for him to die.

07:57.935 --> 08:02.273
So I'm done praying to a God
who answers a murderer over a mother.

-What'd you say?

08:19.415 --> 08:22.835
You never loved Brenton the way I did.
Never.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.881
You never gave him an inch, Isaiah.
You never let him breathe.

08:26.964 --> 08:30.718
If he ever wanted anything,
he came to me, not you.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.637

might've kept him out of that gang,

15:10.659 --> 15:13.537
But I don't understand
how my husband can help you.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.790
He came to the hospital
the night of the accident.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.167
And he, um...

15:18.250 --> 15:19.835
[baby coos, grunts]

15:19.919 --> 15:21.337
He left this.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.172
This seagull belongs to Brenton.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.550
And I need to talk to him.
I need to find out how did he get it.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.469
I need to know what he knows

15:28.552 --> 15:31.805
because I think he does know something
about who killed my son.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.475
You must have the wrong house.

15:34.558 --> 15:36.977
No! No, no, no. This is the right house.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.354
When will he be back?

15:38.854 --> 15:42.524
Um, look, I'm sorry, but you have a child.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.860
-Can you please just understand?
-Mm-hmm.

15:44.944 --> 15:49.782
Um, just have him call me. All right?
Just...

15:49.865 --> 15:51.116
Okay.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.117
Um...

15:52.868 --> 15:54.370
My name is Latrice.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.288
Latrice Butler.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.793
And you can have him call me
at this number. Okay?

16:01.961 --> 16:02.962
Okay.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.964
Okay, thank-- thank you.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.257
Please-- Please have him call me?
Don't forget.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.593
Thank you. Thank you.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.846
[KJ moaning]

16:12.930 --> 16:15.057
[bartender] Come on. Go home. Come on.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.810
But I-- Wait.
I still got a song in the queue.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.186
You're done for tonight, KJ.

16:19.269 --> 16:22.439
Come on.
You haven't heard me sing Aretha!

16:23.065 --> 16:25.526
You should hear it. It's-- It's good.

16:25.609 --> 16:26.860
[whirring]

16:30.197 --> 16:31.240
That's mine.

16:33.909 --> 16:34.952
That's...

16:35.619 --> 16:37.788
Hey! That's my car.

16:37.871 --> 16:40.749
It's impound's car now.
You can have it back in an hour.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.251
You can pick it up here.

16:42.751 --> 16:43.919
I want my fucking car.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.338
Hey, why don't you call a cab, all right?
Hey! Come on!

16:46.422 --> 16:47.798
Lady, you can't be on here.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.842
-I-- ow!
-Get off the truck.

16:49.925 --> 16:54.388
-I will sue you for assault.
-[officer] Is there a problem here, sir?

16:54.972 --> 16:58.058
Ah! Now you want to act like a cop.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.729
Like you know how to do your fucking job.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.106
-Excuse me?
-You heard me the first time.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.232
She bothering you?

17:06.150 --> 17:09.528
-I am an assistant prosecutor...
-All right. All right.

17:09.611 --> 17:12.573
...with the county, so you work for me.

17:13.157 --> 17:16.952
So tell that fucking fuck
to give me my car back!

17:17.036 --> 17:18.620
-Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
-Damn it!

17:18.704 --> 17:19.830
All right, calm down.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.376
You need a ride to the impound lot?
Or help getting home?

17:25.502 --> 17:26.795
I'm fine.

17:28.130 --> 17:32.092
So why don't you mind
your fucking business, Eckerd?

17:32.634 --> 17:36.930
I tell you what to do.
I'm in charge here, not you, Eckerd.

17:37.514 --> 17:40.642
You're all racist assholes.
Every one of you cops.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.646
[door bell buzzing]

17:46.065 --> 17:48.650
-[buzzing continues]
-[mutters indistinctly]

17:50.194 --> 17:52.237
-I know she's here.
-She who?

17:52.321 --> 17:53.614
-Latrice.
-What?

17:53.697 --> 17:55.991
-She ain't come home last night.
-She ain't here neither.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.869
-Latrice!
-Boy, don't be screaming down my place.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.162
Latrice!

18:00.245 --> 18:01.121
[door opens]

18:04.583 --> 18:06.293
Y'all grown ass men.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.670
Daddy would've hated seeing you like this.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.341
You living here now?

18:14.051 --> 18:17.679
Marcelle can barely take care of herself
and got you up under her arm like this?

18:18.680 --> 18:21.683
Why didn't Tricey come home last night?
What'd you do?

18:28.524 --> 18:30.442
I know she like that park on St. Peters.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.195
You want,
I can help you come look for her.

18:33.570 --> 18:34.613
[scoffs]

18:35.405 --> 18:36.532
How?

18:37.282 --> 18:39.284
You gonna get your Five Kings on it?

18:39.785 --> 18:41.787
Have your thugs out there
looking for my wife?

18:41.870 --> 18:44.498
Damn, man. You're like a dog with a bone.
Ain't even about that.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.291
-It's all about that.
-[Marcelle] Hey.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.709
Tricey gone is my fault?

18:48.627 --> 18:50.254
Everything my fault? That what you saying?

18:50.337 --> 18:52.756
Y'all need to see this. Look.

18:53.757 --> 18:56.301
They're saying it was a cop
who killed Brenton.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.106
[DiAngelo]
It's hitting you hard, double-duty.

19:10.774 --> 19:14.069
Nah. I love it. I'm a big fan.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.739
The wife's an even bigger one.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.366
[laughs]

19:19.449 --> 19:20.534
Yeah, I bet.

19:22.744 --> 19:24.746
Especially now with little Mikey.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.087
[rain pattering]

19:33.297 --> 19:35.841
Wasn't in the cards for me, kids.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.052
I, uh... I...

19:40.220 --> 19:41.805
I really wanted them though.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.185
The team's my family.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.313
Yours too.

19:52.316 --> 19:55.652
I'm talking Wilcox when he marries Teresa
and becomes your in-law.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.821
Don't even joke about that shit.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.908
The motherfucker's gonna be over
at your place at Christmas.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.410
Hand down the front of his pants,

20:03.493 --> 20:07.122
farting fucking "Deck the Halls"
for the kid.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.707
[both laughing]

20:18.425 --> 20:20.636
[woman] <i>Channel 9 News</i> here live...

20:20.719 --> 20:22.888
[man] Officers were allegedly involved...

20:28.810 --> 20:30.938
[indistinct chatter]

20:34.441 --> 20:36.068
[officer] Everyone gather around.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.290
[officer] I'm guessing you all seen
the news by now.

20:50.374 --> 20:54.586
They're saying cops from our district
are behind that kid's hit-and-run.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.382
Until we get a handle of what went down,
no one says shit.

20:59.549 --> 21:04.054
As far as the press is concerned,
the South's gone deaf, dumb, and blind.

21:04.137 --> 21:07.724
A reporter shoves a mike in your face,
point them to the Chief's office.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.601
They're handling PR.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.478
[man 1] Know which cops
are being fingered for this?

21:11.561 --> 21:13.814
-[man 2] Or if the case has legs?
-[man 3] Yeah.

21:13.897 --> 21:16.149
I know as much as you do,
which is jack shit.

21:16.566 --> 21:19.778
Which doesn't sit well,
since the cop who caught the case

21:19.861 --> 21:21.321
owed me a heads-up.

21:21.405 --> 21:24.074
Who is this Fish,
whatever the fuck his name is?

21:24.157 --> 21:27.744
The guy's from across the fucking river.
Paint hasn't even dried on his locker yet.

21:27.828 --> 21:31.206
New York City boy lands on this side
of the river and starts stirring shit.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.875
Hopefully eyes on this thing
will stay local.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.670
Shit storm will blow over
in a couple of weeks.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.172
I know that you are all good police.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.551
But that never stopped a fucking reporter
with an itch.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.095
So everyone check their ass.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.306
Good police work.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.640
Get everything on record.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.726
[overlapping chatter]

22:12.914 --> 22:14.082
[doorbell rings]

22:16.668 --> 22:18.545
[doorbell rings repeatedly]

22:18.628 --> 22:20.005
[moans]

22:22.632 --> 22:23.633
[knocking on door]

22:26.261 --> 22:27.888
-[knocking continues]
-Oh, God.

22:30.891 --> 22:33.602
You land on cops,
I want to hear it from you,

22:33.685 --> 22:36.021
not some fucking reporter
calling for comment.

22:37.689 --> 22:38.690
What?

22:39.232 --> 22:41.526
Luis Carillo from the<i> Journal</i> just called,

22:41.610 --> 22:45.280
wanting to know which officers we're
investigating on the Butler hit-and-run.

22:45.655 --> 22:46.740
The press knows?

22:48.909 --> 22:49.868
Who leaked it?

22:51.119 --> 22:53.455
Goddamn it, KJ,
how could you let this happen?

22:54.122 --> 22:55.207
I didn't.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.418
I would never do that to you
and you know it.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.716
How bad is this?

23:06.885 --> 23:09.012
We think we're looking at four officers.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.182
Three were identified
at the scene of the crime,

23:12.265 --> 23:15.393
and I need to find the driver first
before arresting the others.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.686
Well, who are the three?

23:18.522 --> 23:21.775
Michael DiAngelo, Felix Osorio,
and Manny Wilcox.

23:21.858 --> 23:24.861
Fucking great.
That's the city's star task force.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.530
All these reduced crime stats

23:26.613 --> 23:29.533
I'm blowing out my ass
on the campaign trail is due to them.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.201
Don't worry.

23:31.910 --> 23:32.953
It's not going forward.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.872
I already told the detective working it
to drop it.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.834
Why? Does the case not hold weight?

23:39.626 --> 23:43.797
-Carillo told me you had a witness.
-Yeah, a 15-year-old heroin junkie.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.008
Media's all over this, KJ.
All anybody's gonna do is see color.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.135
We've gotta move forward.

23:49.845 --> 23:50.804
"We"?

23:52.681 --> 23:53.557
Count me out.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.309
I'm not switching prosecutors
mid-stream. How is that gonna look?

23:57.310 --> 23:58.186
Right.

23:59.396 --> 24:02.023
A black female prosecutor's
better for optics.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.442
Fuck that.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.069
You have a nice collection of us.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.822
No one would even notice
if you switched me out.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.324
Oh, God, James.

24:13.076 --> 24:14.077
Believe me...

24:15.829 --> 24:17.247
you don't want me on this.

24:21.585 --> 24:25.463
You think you'd be tired of it by now,
constantly looking in your rear-view.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.134
You know what I'm tired of?

24:30.177 --> 24:32.637
You constantly using my past against me.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.016
Using it when you need a carrot
or a stick.

24:36.892 --> 24:40.103
This case is yours.
You fought for it, you're stuck with it.

24:40.937 --> 24:43.982
I'm calling a press conference
later today. I expect you there.

24:49.529 --> 24:50.447
[door opens]

24:52.574 --> 24:53.408
[door closes]

24:59.789 --> 25:01.458
-Fish Rinaldi.
-Yeah.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.002
I gotta ask,
where'd you get the nickname?

25:04.085 --> 25:06.087
Uh, my CO at the academy
stuck me with it.

25:06.171 --> 25:09.174
I failed the swimming test twice,
so Fish it was.

25:09.716 --> 25:12.219
-Which academy you go to?
-College Point.

25:12.802 --> 25:13.929
Right.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.306
Not Stamler over on this side
of the river?

25:17.349 --> 25:19.601
You know, most transfers, they come over,

25:20.393 --> 25:24.147
they do some time at our academy,
at least a year on patrol.

25:24.564 --> 25:25.398
Hm.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.150
But not you.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.237
You hopscotched over all that.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.822
I always wondered if Fish Rinaldi

25:32.906 --> 25:36.326
was some spoiled rich shit
with connections.

25:38.995 --> 25:39.871
Is that it?

25:40.830 --> 25:42.415
You a spoiled rich shit?

25:45.043 --> 25:48.296
-I'm a cop doing my job.
-Your job's locking up other cops now?

25:49.047 --> 25:50.048
I miss a memo?

25:50.507 --> 25:52.092
The job's locking up bad guys.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.722
Which one of my guys are you calling bad?

26:01.518 --> 26:04.020
The news leaked
before we could nail anybody down.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.857
We still don't have any specifics,
so no names.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.151
Oh, you're a cool one, I'll give you that.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.363
You expect me to buy that?

26:13.446 --> 26:16.574
I expect you to let me do right by this
kid, which isn't easy given the visuals.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.243
Thought you of all people
would understand.

26:18.326 --> 26:19.911
Only color I see is blue.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.665
That's the only color
anyone in my district sees.

26:29.337 --> 26:31.089
Hey. Look at this.

26:33.174 --> 26:34.009
What?

26:34.926 --> 26:36.177
Hey, look who's here.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.138
Ah, shit.

26:38.555 --> 26:41.016
-Hang on a sec, all right?
-Pathetic, you know what I mean?

26:41.099 --> 26:42.350
What does she want?

26:42.434 --> 26:45.103
[indistinct chatter]

26:45.186 --> 26:48.106
Oh, hey.
I'm looking for Detective Rinaldi.

26:49.190 --> 26:50.608
Have a seat at his desk.

27:03.705 --> 27:04.789
[all laughing]

27:04.873 --> 27:06.458
Hey, you want to take a seat?

27:11.546 --> 27:14.341
-What the fuck?
-Want a desk to go with that chair?

27:15.216 --> 27:18.261
Where you gonna hide
your Tampax box now, Fish?

27:19.346 --> 27:21.348
-Fucking children.
-[laughter continues]

27:21.431 --> 27:23.975
Take her with you. Gone fishin'.

27:32.692 --> 27:35.153
Fish! Fish!

27:36.237 --> 27:38.782
Hey! Why would you leak the story?

27:38.865 --> 27:40.867
Me? What the fuck you talking about?
It was you.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.369
[KJ] It wasn't me.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.037
Maybe it was one of the cops.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.331
-Maybe one of them grew a conscience.
-Why are you here?

27:46.414 --> 27:48.667
What the fuck do you want?

27:50.293 --> 27:52.504
Connelly said
I had to keep working this case.

27:54.464 --> 27:57.008
We need to get logs for any autos
the narc unit might've used.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.093
That's not gonna happen.

27:58.885 --> 28:01.846
It's too late. We had our chance,
but now they scrubbed all that.

28:01.930 --> 28:05.350
Auto logs, motor pool sign-ins,
all fucking gone, guaranteed.

28:05.433 --> 28:06.643
Want to find that blue car?

28:06.726 --> 28:09.604
It's in the bottom of the Hudson,
next to my fucking desk.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.607
But hey, you got to belt out
some Anita Baker, right?

28:12.982 --> 28:14.067
Priorities.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.694
We have a witness.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.908
Connelly thinks I already got her ID
of DiAngelo and the others on record.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.035
And I didn't correct him.

28:25.745 --> 28:28.456
Let's start with getting her ID
of the three, okay?

28:30.333 --> 28:33.586
How are we gonna get a photo to her
if you can't get into the system?

28:37.006 --> 28:38.842
Smile for the camera, motherfuckers.

28:44.347 --> 28:46.015
[pastor] When Paul speaks of stewardship,

28:46.099 --> 28:49.644
he is giving Christians
a special charge to--

28:49.728 --> 28:50.979
Excuse me, everybody.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.023
Brother Butler.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.151
Anybody seen Latrice?

28:57.610 --> 28:58.653
[man] She ain't been seen.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.905
-She's been missing since yesterday.
-[man] No.

29:01.656 --> 29:02.782
You check with your family?

29:02.866 --> 29:04.909
I checked everywhere. I can't find her.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.287
[soft stammer]

29:07.787 --> 29:09.789
I think she might be in some trouble.

29:10.331 --> 29:13.543
[pastor] Y'all get on your phones
calling everyone

29:13.626 --> 29:16.463
or out in your cars looking everywhere,
all right?

29:16.546 --> 29:17.547
[man] Yes, sir.

29:17.630 --> 29:20.091
Let's practice stewardship right now.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.635
-[low chatter]
-Let's put our faith in practice.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.222
[woman whispers] God bless.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.640
[man] Be strong, brother.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.059
[bird cawing]

29:44.324 --> 29:46.576
[dog barks in distance]

30:00.965 --> 30:03.051
[Marie whispers indistinctly]

30:03.927 --> 30:05.428
[baby cooing]

30:07.680 --> 30:09.432
[baby cries]

30:09.516 --> 30:11.392
-[doorbell rings]
-[knocking on door]

30:12.685 --> 30:14.020
[knocking continues]

30:14.103 --> 30:15.104
Hello!

30:16.314 --> 30:17.690
-[baby coos]
-[doorbell ringing]

30:17.774 --> 30:18.817
[knocking continues]

30:18.900 --> 30:20.068
[Latrice] Hello!

30:20.151 --> 30:22.570
It's Latrice Butler from yesterday.

30:22.654 --> 30:23.947
-[doorbell rings]
-It's okay, baby.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.450
Hello!

30:28.743 --> 30:30.495
[ringing doorbell]

30:31.162 --> 30:33.081
Hello! Mrs...

30:34.082 --> 30:35.166
Um...

31:05.738 --> 31:06.823
[indistinct chatter]

31:08.783 --> 31:10.702
[Messiah] Hurry, hurry, hurry. Go, go, go.

31:12.954 --> 31:13.997
Nice!

31:15.456 --> 31:17.041
[child chatters indistinctly]

31:17.125 --> 31:18.459
[boy] Whoo!

31:18.543 --> 31:20.003
[Messiah] Come on, come on, come on.

31:20.086 --> 31:21.129
[man] Go, go!

31:22.338 --> 31:23.339
Dad, you see that?

31:23.423 --> 31:25.884
[Messiah laughs]
Nice. Yeah, I saw that, man.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.427
Go again, I'm watching.

31:32.307 --> 31:35.184
See you more in the last week
than the last ten years.

31:36.686 --> 31:37.979
Not complaining though.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.775
Heard it was cops
that took down little man.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.737
Shit's fucked up, man.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.494
Back in the day,
we was wide-eyed like that.

31:55.663 --> 32:00.627
Coming up here, looking out,
believing it's all out there for us,

32:00.710 --> 32:02.503
just waiting to be snatched.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.131
That young, ain't been hit
with the real yet.

32:05.214 --> 32:07.425
[children screaming, chattering]

32:07.842 --> 32:10.386
But the real is just waiting
to swallow you whole.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.972
Nah, bro, it ain't that deep.

32:14.766 --> 32:18.311
World looks at you sideways,
you get on your hustle.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.940
I boxed this city and I boxed a bullet.

32:22.857 --> 32:26.694
Now, I'm on top
of the motherfucking world, man.

32:27.737 --> 32:28.863
King of the game.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.078
I want back in, blood.

32:38.414 --> 32:40.833
What you need, bank? A place to stay?

32:40.917 --> 32:42.210
-Whatever, I got you.
-No, no.

32:42.293 --> 32:43.419
This ain't that, all right?

32:43.503 --> 32:45.797
I'm already owing you
for the hospital bills.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.633
I want back in.

32:49.342 --> 32:50.259
[scoffs]

32:51.344 --> 32:54.180
What? You done being
"all that you can be"?

32:54.263 --> 32:55.223
That it?

32:56.015 --> 32:57.642
Left you did.

32:58.726 --> 33:01.437
You got your own way.
You found your own life.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.939
Yo, what life, man?

33:04.565 --> 33:05.817
What life?

33:06.776 --> 33:10.154
-I'm staying up in my nephew's bunk bed.
-Well, go put on a uniform again.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.447
Over there is the same as here.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.825
At least y'all ain't fronting
like you something you ain't.

33:16.786 --> 33:19.497
Soldiering with you
was the last time shit was solid.

33:21.541 --> 33:22.667
Made sense.

33:29.048 --> 33:31.009
You said you got me, whatever.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.719
It's what you said, right?

33:35.930 --> 33:36.973
Whatever, 'Siah.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.028
All right, let's do this.

33:51.195 --> 33:55.742
I'll have one of the boys put you up.
Set you up on Woodlawn and Ocean.

33:56.659 --> 33:59.454
Nah, I ain't worked a corner
since I was 14 years old, man. Come on.

33:59.537 --> 34:02.165
The fuck you think this is? A temp agency?

34:02.957 --> 34:04.459
You work what I say.

34:12.341 --> 34:15.386
Maybe we cut out, Mike.
Get the fuck out while we still can.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.972
Maybe we hang a giant pointer over us

34:18.056 --> 34:19.932
that says, "Lookee here.
We did this shit."

34:20.016 --> 34:24.812
"We"? What the fuck you talking "we"?
Wasn't me who killed that fucking kid.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.106
[Osorio] All right, Einstein,
let's hear what you got.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.233
I ain't doing ten years at Trenton
over this.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.819
Nobody's doing nothing, all right?

34:33.738 --> 34:36.491
The scene was clean, I made sure of that.

34:37.867 --> 34:40.495
That SUV's a fucking soda bottle by now,
so what do they got?

34:40.578 --> 34:44.957
They got a fucking drunk running point,
a reject from the city riding shotgun.

34:45.041 --> 34:48.336
We're good. Everyone level the fuck out.

34:50.922 --> 34:55.134
They got a witness. A kid you said
we didn't have to worry about.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.303
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:57.386 --> 34:59.806
-What the fuck is he talking about?
-She's a fucking junkie.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.474
She's a junkie. Who cares?

35:01.557 --> 35:03.017
You knew there was a witness?

35:04.769 --> 35:07.146
She didn't see nothing.
I made sure of it, all right?

35:07.271 --> 35:09.857
-We're in the clear.
-Open your eyes, man!

35:09.941 --> 35:12.485
If she didn't see us, how come they know
it was cops that did it?

35:13.486 --> 35:15.655
I've been wondering the same thing myself.

35:16.989 --> 35:19.617
How you wet your fucking panties
over that girl.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.830
How you been moaning since jump,
on me about Dorsey,

35:23.913 --> 35:26.374
about shoveling too much shit
for the new guy.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.877
Here I am, trying to cover all our asses.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.631
I never stopped once to think
who might've put them out there.

35:34.841 --> 35:38.344
You saying I leaked this shit?
Why the fuck would I do that?

35:38.427 --> 35:40.471
You know, not for nothing,
you did come at me

35:40.555 --> 35:42.265
when that reporter came talking to you.

35:43.516 --> 35:45.393
Me and Carillo were bullshitting.
Didn't mean noth--

35:45.476 --> 35:47.812
You're fucking bullshitting
with the guy from the paper

35:47.895 --> 35:49.021
who broke the story?

35:49.105 --> 35:50.898
No, man, Osorio ain't like that.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.442
I got the same rope around my neck
as you.

35:53.526 --> 35:55.111
What sense would that make,
giving us all up?

35:56.863 --> 35:57.989
Hey, hey!

35:59.115 --> 36:00.283
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

36:01.742 --> 36:03.661
Maybe you got a little something
on the side.

36:03.744 --> 36:05.830
You making a deal behind our backs, huh?

36:06.330 --> 36:08.457
Let a little something slip
to your<i> gata,</i> huh?

36:08.541 --> 36:09.834
Don't you walk away from me.

36:09.917 --> 36:13.045
I never said nothing to that reporter.
I never said nothing to nobody.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.006
Fuck you if you don't believe that shit.

36:16.966 --> 36:19.218
-[car door opens, closes]
-[engine starts]

36:19.302 --> 36:21.429
Are you telling me Osorio did this shit?

36:22.305 --> 36:23.723
You telling me he didn't?

36:28.811 --> 36:30.855
[rap music playing in the car]

36:35.484 --> 36:36.319
[music stops]

36:36.402 --> 36:37.820
What you want to see me about?

36:38.529 --> 36:40.823
A couple weeks back,
me and my boys here

36:40.907 --> 36:43.951
were trying to break your boy Goldie
on Stevens Ave.

36:44.035 --> 36:48.206
February 15, morning of, trying to pin him
for a couple eight balls.

36:48.289 --> 36:52.710
Just so you know what went down
anyone comes asking.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.839
So if y'all in the projects
busting heads that morning,

36:57.048 --> 36:58.966
that leaves y'all clear of the park.

37:00.676 --> 37:03.429
Sure you weren't wiping no Brenton Butler
off your whip?

37:04.764 --> 37:05.598
What?

37:06.307 --> 37:08.309
Shooting us in the back
got a little too easy?

37:08.392 --> 37:10.144
You just bring me your boy Goldie.

37:11.270 --> 37:13.105
I'll put him on the same page.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.026
See...

37:17.985 --> 37:22.156
the thing about Goldie is that his memory
is a little patchy, you feel me?

37:22.990 --> 37:25.576
So it's gonna take a little time
to get it tight.

37:26.827 --> 37:29.914
Time off the street. Time that costs me.

37:32.416 --> 37:35.378
My cut lowers by two points.
That enough for your time?

37:35.461 --> 37:36.754
Best make that four points.

37:44.387 --> 37:46.389
This shit is digging
into our fucking pockets now?

37:46.472 --> 37:49.267
Hey, what you rather,
four points or four fucking years?

37:49.350 --> 37:50.643
At least now we got cover.

37:50.726 --> 37:53.187
But none of that means shit
if someone puts us at the scene.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.606
Now what about the fucking witness?

38:00.361 --> 38:01.779
Get the fuck out of here.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.702
-[bell rings]
-[kids chattering]

38:07.827 --> 38:09.704
[car doors open]

38:17.962 --> 38:18.921
Nadine.

38:21.048 --> 38:21.882
Hey!

38:23.592 --> 38:24.760
Where you going?

38:25.511 --> 38:27.054
My parents said I can't talk to you.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.015
Yeah, when did you become
Miss By-The-Book?

38:29.098 --> 38:31.976
Our lawyer's name is Marty Shane.
You have questions, ask him.

38:32.059 --> 38:34.312
Come on, I just need you to make an ID
for the prosecutor.

38:34.395 --> 38:36.147
Nothing's easier. She's right here.

38:36.731 --> 38:39.734
-KJ Harper, it's nice to finally meet you.
-[keys jingling]

38:40.109 --> 38:41.902
-[car alarm beeps]
-Nadine.

38:44.238 --> 38:45.323
Come on. Nadine.

38:48.367 --> 38:51.120
The men you saw in the park that morning,
they in this photo?

38:51.829 --> 38:53.164
I said I can't help you.

38:53.247 --> 38:56.667
You can, but you just won't.
There's a difference.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.587
You know who they are.
We gotta put it on the record.

38:59.670 --> 39:02.715
Just point, Nadine. Come on.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.717
Besties forever, right?

39:08.137 --> 39:10.639
These are all the cops
in the South District.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.433
The photo was taken a few months ago.

39:14.810 --> 39:15.728
Come on.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.314
All you gotta do is point.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.910
-No, Nadine. Come on.
-[engine starts]

39:33.079 --> 39:36.207
You took his boots. The least you can do
is help find who killed him.

39:36.290 --> 39:39.627
-Hey, what are you-- Let me handle it.
-Let go of my car door.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.921
You go in that ditch
and pull those boots off his feet?

39:42.004 --> 39:44.548
What? No! Oh, my God!
I didn't even see him.

39:44.882 --> 39:47.802
-It's not my fault what happened.
-Of course not. Let me handle this.

39:47.885 --> 39:50.513
You didn't maybe wonder why
there was a kid's pair of boots

39:50.596 --> 39:53.182
lying in the snow in the middle of nowhere

39:53.265 --> 39:54.475
with blood everywhere?

39:54.558 --> 39:55.851
I didn't see any blood.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.979
I didn't see anything except
those stupid fucking seagull boots!

39:59.397 --> 40:01.440
So what if I took them? Fuck off!

40:02.066 --> 40:03.901
-Hey, come on. Hey, lis--
-Fuck off!

40:05.569 --> 40:07.613
-Nadine, come on!
-[tires screeching]

40:17.665 --> 40:19.333
What was the point of that shitshow?

40:20.251 --> 40:23.170
She's just a kid. You treat her
like she's some kind of suspect?

40:24.922 --> 40:26.132
I'm talking to you!

40:27.842 --> 40:28.676
[sighs]

40:28.759 --> 40:30.845
There was a seagull in his bike.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.931
And on his shoes, in his bedroom.

40:34.014 --> 40:36.892
And Latrice said
she saw a man with a seagull.

40:36.976 --> 40:37.810
So what?

40:38.352 --> 40:40.896
You went through the evidence
when you told me shoes were missing.

40:41.522 --> 40:44.442
-You logged the bike too, right?
-Yeah, of course I did.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.777
What about this? Did you log this?

40:48.487 --> 40:49.947
Did you see the seagull or not?

40:50.030 --> 40:52.908
The Property and Evidence sheet
is in there. I don't know. I...

40:55.786 --> 40:56.704
Uh...

40:56.787 --> 41:01.792
"Bike, jeans, hoodie, socks,
undershirt, underwear."

41:02.460 --> 41:03.461
No seagull.

41:04.044 --> 41:07.465
It was never logged into evidence,
but-- but it was right here.

41:09.341 --> 41:11.010
Well, it never made it to the district.

41:11.093 --> 41:14.638
Latrice said a man came
into Brenton's hospital room that night,

41:14.722 --> 41:17.766
and he left a paper seagull with Brenton.

41:19.643 --> 41:22.229
Only a cop could've taken that
from the crime scene.

41:23.814 --> 41:25.900
-That's the driver.
-Yeah.

41:36.869 --> 41:39.538
What'd you do with her?
What'd you do with my wife?

41:39.997 --> 41:42.291
You people killed my son.
If you laid a finger on Latrice--

41:42.374 --> 41:44.126
Take it easy. What are you talking about?

41:44.210 --> 41:46.712
We're here because we want to find
who hurt Brenton.

41:47.213 --> 41:50.424
We need to talk to your wife. She might
be able to ID the man who did it.

41:52.426 --> 41:54.220
She's been missing since yesterday.

41:54.887 --> 41:58.766
Look, she-- she said she saw the man
from Brenton's room.

41:59.892 --> 42:01.101
Saw him on the street.

42:02.937 --> 42:03.979
Said he was a cop.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.398
I gotta keep looking for her.

42:09.610 --> 42:10.778
Mr. Butler.

42:11.487 --> 42:12.530
[KJ sighs]

42:13.822 --> 42:16.116
I think I might have an idea where she is.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.369
Have you tried the park?

42:39.348 --> 42:40.641
[sighs]

42:48.023 --> 42:49.024
Latrice!

42:51.694 --> 42:52.778
Latrice!

42:58.534 --> 42:59.660
Latrice!

43:04.456 --> 43:05.457
Latrice!

43:15.342 --> 43:18.095
-Where were you?
-[Latrice] Why'd you bring that cop here?

43:18.512 --> 43:20.806
[Isaiah] I know you don't trust them,
but maybe they can help.

43:22.308 --> 43:23.392
[KJ] Mrs. Butler?

43:27.271 --> 43:28.314
Mrs. Butler...

43:28.731 --> 43:33.235
I know that everything
you're hearing in the news

43:33.319 --> 43:35.571
about the police being responsible...

43:35.654 --> 43:38.949
you're scared and you don't know
who you can trust right now.

43:41.327 --> 43:44.830
But everyone here, right now,
we all want the same thing.

43:46.373 --> 43:47.916
To find who killed your son.

43:51.920 --> 43:52.880
We...

43:53.589 --> 43:56.634
We need you to identify the man you saw
in Brenton's hospital room.

43:57.926 --> 44:00.137
This is the entire South District.

44:00.679 --> 44:01.680
Take your time.

44:02.890 --> 44:05.392
[seagulls squawking]

44:36.090 --> 44:37.841
So this is all the police, then?

44:39.218 --> 44:41.845
Are you sure this is all of them
in the district?

44:41.929 --> 44:42.805
Yeah.

44:48.310 --> 44:49.144
He's not here.

44:50.145 --> 44:51.105
Are you sure?

44:53.690 --> 44:56.693
The man you saw yesterday, the cop,
his face must be fresh in your mind.

44:56.777 --> 44:58.570
We'll get you back with a sketch artist.

45:02.741 --> 45:05.452
That man wasn't the man at the hospital.

45:07.704 --> 45:09.998
I went to his house. I saw him.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.961
-I made a mistake.
-You said you were sure.

45:14.044 --> 45:15.462
I was emotional.

45:17.589 --> 45:19.466
And I wasn't seeing things clear.

45:21.343 --> 45:22.469
I was wrong.

45:25.806 --> 45:28.892
Do you have the seagull he left?
We can test it for prints.

45:33.689 --> 45:34.815
I threw it away.

45:40.112 --> 45:41.196
[Fish scoffs]

45:43.615 --> 45:44.867
Shit.

46:03.302 --> 46:05.304
[man]<i> South District, Sergeant Mahoney.</i>

46:05.387 --> 46:06.805
This is DiAngelo.

46:06.889 --> 46:09.433
Listen, about that old power plant
near the park.

46:10.267 --> 46:12.519
Keep eyes for a junkie, white girl,

46:12.603 --> 46:16.690
15, 16, purple streak in her hair,
goes by "Nadine."

46:17.691 --> 46:18.692
It's low-key.

46:19.485 --> 46:23.697
Let me know if she comes in.
I need to have a little talk with her.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.115
[Mahoney]<i> Yeah, okay, D.</i>

46:29.369 --> 46:30.412
[train honking]

46:43.342 --> 46:44.259
[keys clatter]

46:58.065 --> 46:59.566
A woman came here.

47:01.026 --> 47:03.320
She said you know something
about her son.

47:05.489 --> 47:06.365
What?

47:06.907 --> 47:09.159
The accident on the news,
the car accident.

47:12.663 --> 47:15.624
Petey, quit looking at me like
you don't know what I'm talking about.

47:16.792 --> 47:19.419
The SUV isn't in the shop, is it?

47:40.482 --> 47:41.692
It was me.

47:47.155 --> 47:48.615
It was me that hit him.

47:50.492 --> 47:53.495
I was going to the hospital and I, uh...

47:54.413 --> 47:56.164
I wanted to help him.

47:57.791 --> 47:59.626
But DiAngelo, he...

48:02.212 --> 48:03.880
He told me to drive away.

48:06.967 --> 48:08.677
What do you want me to do?

48:11.722 --> 48:14.808
I'll turn myself in. I'll do it right now.

48:19.146 --> 48:20.355
No.

48:23.734 --> 48:24.735
No.

48:26.737 --> 48:27.738
You won't.

48:36.413 --> 48:38.081
She lost a child.

48:41.752 --> 48:42.919
So did we.

48:50.719 --> 48:54.014
I held our baby girl in my arms
and I thought I was gonna die too,

48:54.097 --> 48:55.182
but I didn't.

48:59.144 --> 49:01.021
I stayed for you.

49:02.356 --> 49:03.690
For us.

49:06.026 --> 49:07.778
This is about our family.

49:10.113 --> 49:11.239
Our son.

49:13.367 --> 49:14.409
Not hers.

49:16.995 --> 49:20.040
I don't care about that woman.
I don't care about her son.

49:22.793 --> 49:26.797
So whatever you did, that's on you.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.884
You need to find a way to live with it.

49:34.179 --> 49:36.056
Because you're not leaving me alone.

49:39.017 --> 49:40.227
With no husband...

49:41.687 --> 49:44.481
no money, and a two-week-old baby.

49:46.692 --> 49:48.735
That's not the life you promised me.

49:57.828 --> 49:59.746
That's not the life I want.

50:14.636 --> 50:17.931
We should get in the house,
get you something to eat.

50:28.692 --> 50:30.277
We were upset yesterday.

50:32.446 --> 50:33.697
We're both grieving.

50:35.866 --> 50:37.617
We didn't mean none of what was said.

50:39.661 --> 50:41.872
So let's go in the house,
get you something to eat.

50:45.751 --> 50:47.711
I'm not going in the house with you.

50:52.090 --> 50:54.718
I know you spent years to get us here.

50:55.469 --> 50:57.387
Double-shifts, late nights.

50:58.513 --> 51:00.849
And I got a house, but...

51:03.435 --> 51:04.561
lost you, though.

51:05.729 --> 51:08.440
Wanting a better life for my family,
that's a crime now?

51:08.523 --> 51:10.317
I wanted the same thing.

51:16.865 --> 51:20.494
Just never going to be enough love
in that house to make it home.

51:20.577 --> 51:24.080
Love, love? Don't-- Don't talk to me
about love or what you want.

51:25.582 --> 51:26.708
[sighs]

51:27.918 --> 51:29.461
This is just the grief talking.

51:29.544 --> 51:30.545
No.

51:33.298 --> 51:34.758
It's me talking.

51:43.016 --> 51:47.270
I've been wondering
why Brenton loved those birds so much.

51:50.065 --> 51:52.025
And that's why I went out there today.

51:55.362 --> 51:58.448
Not to the place where he died,
but where he lived.

52:01.451 --> 52:03.370
I wanted to see what he saw.

52:05.831 --> 52:08.458
And I saw the sky went on forever.

52:10.210 --> 52:11.878
And I saw light.

52:12.921 --> 52:14.631
So much light.

52:16.258 --> 52:17.342
[sighs]

52:19.886 --> 52:21.471
That's what Brenton saw.

52:23.723 --> 52:25.976
He saw how big life is.

52:27.811 --> 52:28.979
[sighs]

52:30.522 --> 52:33.233
Tell me you knew that
about your son, Isaiah.

52:38.321 --> 52:40.907
Tell me you didn't believe your son
was in a gang.

52:45.745 --> 52:47.622
I know that's what you want to hear.

52:49.624 --> 52:51.293
But if I'm going to be honest...

52:52.002 --> 52:53.461
before you and God...

52:57.507 --> 52:58.633
it's the bike.

53:01.845 --> 53:03.096
How'd he get that bike?

53:15.859 --> 53:17.027
You coming inside?

53:22.365 --> 53:23.325
No.

53:32.500 --> 53:35.587
We should arrest DiAngelo
and those other two fucks right now.

53:35.670 --> 53:38.590
We need the fourth guy.
He was probably our driver.

53:38.673 --> 53:40.550
And if we go after the other three first,

53:40.634 --> 53:43.303
we might spook him
and lose the guy actually responsible.

53:43.386 --> 53:44.638
You want to risk that?

53:45.430 --> 53:46.973
-Where's Connelly?
-[sighs]

53:48.850 --> 53:49.684
That's good.

53:52.979 --> 53:55.023
We appreciate you understanding, Jimmy.

53:55.857 --> 53:56.775
[KJ] James.

53:57.901 --> 53:59.945
-We need to talk.
-[Connelly] Now isn't a good time.

54:00.028 --> 54:03.156
I need to interview South District police,
all of them.

54:03.615 --> 54:05.617
Our suspect took something
from the crime scene.

54:05.700 --> 54:07.160
There has been a change of plans.

54:07.243 --> 54:09.621
It would be reckless to say
the police are suspects at this point.

54:09.704 --> 54:12.290
But they are, and it's already out there.

54:12.374 --> 54:13.750
Not to mention it's the truth.

54:14.209 --> 54:16.419
So-called truth that we still can't prove.

54:16.503 --> 54:17.337
Mmm.

54:17.420 --> 54:20.215
Give me the funds to hire
an accident expert.

54:20.298 --> 54:22.550
Look, I can narrow down the search
for this blue car.

54:22.634 --> 54:24.886
-I need to talk to the district police.
-KJ. KJ.

54:24.970 --> 54:26.054
Calling out the cops this early

54:26.137 --> 54:28.682
would create nothing but a dangerous
atmosphere in our community.

54:28.765 --> 54:33.603
[scoffs] Who wrote that line for you,
your press secretary,

54:33.687 --> 54:36.272
or the brass
you were cluster-fucking just now?

54:39.234 --> 54:41.152
Don't talk about the car.
Don't talk about the cops.

54:41.236 --> 54:42.320
We do this my way.

54:43.655 --> 54:45.865
-Fuck.
-Have fun circling the wagons.

54:48.410 --> 54:50.120
[camera shutters clicking]

54:55.333 --> 54:59.754
First and foremost, my sincere
condolences to the Butler family.

55:01.172 --> 55:02.799
I'm a father myself,

55:02.882 --> 55:06.386
and I cannot even fathom the pain
that they are facing right now.

55:07.846 --> 55:11.683
But despite what you are hearing
from some of your overzealous colleagues,

55:11.766 --> 55:13.810
this investigation is still ongoing.

55:13.893 --> 55:16.229
We have not landed on any suspects.

55:16.312 --> 55:18.898
I'm devoting the full resources
of my office to this case

55:18.982 --> 55:23.486
and have one of my best and brightest,
assistant prosecutor KJ Harper,

55:23.570 --> 55:24.988
leading the charge. Luis.

55:25.071 --> 55:29.242
Jersey City PD and the prosecutor's office
share an especially close relationship.

55:29.325 --> 55:31.870
How will you keep that bias
from affecting the case?

55:31.953 --> 55:35.707
If I can remind you, Luis,
it was the press who pointed to the cops.

55:35.790 --> 55:38.293
My office is still doing
its due diligence.

55:38.376 --> 55:40.754
And whatever the outcome,
we will remain impartial.

55:41.504 --> 55:43.465
So you're saying cops aren't suspects?

55:43.548 --> 55:47.510
I'm saying that whoever is responsible,
Brenton Butler deserves justice.

55:47.594 --> 55:48.803
His family deserves it.

55:48.887 --> 55:50.680
It's a simple question.
Are you looking at cops--

55:50.764 --> 55:53.850
-It is too early to say definitively.
-Yes, it's too early to say definitively

55:53.933 --> 55:55.560
-how many cops are involved.
-[all murmur]

55:55.643 --> 55:58.313
But we know they were cops
from the South District.

55:58.396 --> 56:01.024
-You saying there was a cover-up?
-Know the motive behind the killing?

56:01.107 --> 56:02.859
As the prosecutor stated,

56:03.651 --> 56:06.279
the investigation is in its early stages.

56:06.362 --> 56:10.283
But we do know one of the perpetrators
left the scene in a blue vehicle.

56:10.366 --> 56:14.621
So if anyone has any information
on the vehicle or on its owner,

56:14.704 --> 56:17.373
I urge you to contact
the prosecutor's office.

56:17.457 --> 56:18.708
[overlapping chatter]

56:19.709 --> 56:22.295
-Is there something you're not telling us?
-Thank you. Thank you.

56:22.378 --> 56:24.172
How high up could this go, KJ?

56:25.298 --> 56:26.466
Thank you.

56:26.549 --> 56:27.759
You have any questions for me?

56:27.842 --> 56:29.552
Thank you. You. Thank you very much.

56:29.636 --> 56:32.639
Okay, thank you. Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.

56:32.722 --> 56:33.598
Sir!

56:37.268 --> 56:40.730
Janie, no one's coming in here.
Come on, baby. Come on.

56:41.731 --> 56:43.441
-What the fuck?
-[screams]

56:43.691 --> 56:44.526
[grunting]

56:44.609 --> 56:46.569
Motherfucker! I'll kill you!

56:55.370 --> 56:56.412
Where is she?

56:58.164 --> 56:59.332
Where's Nadine?

56:59.416 --> 57:01.334
