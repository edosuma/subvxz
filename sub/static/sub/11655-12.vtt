AKU: Long ago,
in a distant land,

00:04.631 --> 00:09.260
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.385 --> 00:12.764
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.097 --> 00:18.478
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword,

00:18.561 --> 00:21.564
stepped forth to oppose me.

00:26.611 --> 00:29.322
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.405 --> 00:33.701
and flung him into the future,
where my evil is law.

00:34.077 --> 00:38.122
Now the fool seeks to return to the past

00:38.373 --> 00:42.961
and undo the future that is Aku.
