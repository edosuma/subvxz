WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:02.365
Thomas,
welcome back to the Navy.

00:02.536 --> 00:04.059
You've just been recalled.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.397
All right.

00:06.474 --> 00:07.873
I witnessed a drop.

00:07.942 --> 00:10.672
Do you have any hard evidence
of any security breach?

00:10.745 --> 00:12.110
She's in the
communications building.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.204
What are the chances
of buying you a cup of coffee?

00:14.281 --> 00:15.748
Alex?
Andy.

00:15.883 --> 00:17.111
What's going on here?

00:17.184 --> 00:19.812
I thought I saw Thomas Magnum
in uniform.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.319
What are you doing?
That's my car!

00:22.390 --> 00:24.415
You're under arrest
for suspicion of espionage.

00:24.492 --> 00:28.223
The maximum penalty for such
a crime is life imprisonment.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.099
Aloha,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:48.175 --> 01:51.008
Good afternoon and welcome
to the third annual

01:51.078 --> 01:54.138
Waikiki to Kaneohe
bicycle endurance race.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.411
Hope you're having a nice time
here at the Falls of Clyde.

01:57.852 --> 02:01.049
Now, if the contestants will take
their vehicles to the starting line.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.613
We'll get underway
momentarily.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.940
Come, let's take a picture.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.207
Come. Come right here.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.513
The start
is of the utmost importance.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.846
Now then,

04:13.487 --> 04:15.079
on your mark,

04:15.856 --> 04:17.118
get set...

04:24.798 --> 04:26.823
Come on, Rick,
you've got to keep it straight.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.333
I'm trying!

04:28.402 --> 04:29.960
If you don't know
how to steer this thing...

04:30.037 --> 04:31.334
I know how!

04:31.405 --> 04:33.430
You guys are just throwing
off my concentration

04:33.507 --> 04:34.633
with all this yapping!

04:34.708 --> 04:35.800
T.C.: Yapping?

04:35.876 --> 04:38.436
Faster, men!
We're losing valuable time.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.314
Uh-oh!
No. Don't say uh-oh.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.907
The wheel. The wheel,
it's loose. It's...

04:55.129 --> 04:56.790
What have you done?

04:56.864 --> 04:59.458
It wasn't our fault, Higgins.
The wheel fell off.

04:59.533 --> 05:03.060
And I can't ride a bed that's
gonna throw me off every 20 feet.

05:03.203 --> 05:04.534
I quit.
Yeah.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.773
Count me out.
I'm finished, too.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.899
And I'm with you.
See you later, Higgins.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.967
Stay right where you are.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.577
Are you telling me that after giving
your word, your solemn oath...

05:14.648 --> 05:16.206
It was hardly an oath.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.816
After making a promise not only to
the Carole Kai Bed Race Association

05:19.887 --> 05:22.947
and the membership of the King
Kamehameha United Charity Drive,

05:23.023 --> 05:24.684
but also to
the downtrodden youngsters

05:24.758 --> 05:27.124
of the Queen Liliuokalani
Anglo-Hawaiian Orphanage,

05:27.194 --> 05:29.059
you would let a little
thing like a broken wheel

05:29.129 --> 05:31.029
deter you from your duty?

05:31.098 --> 05:32.224
Well, I guess
that sums it all up.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.563
You have no choice.
You're an employee.

05:34.635 --> 05:35.624
Wait a minute, Higgins.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.694
How come the members of the
King Kamehameha Charity Drive

05:37.771 --> 05:39.705
can't push their own
bed in the race?

05:39.773 --> 05:42.571
You know why.
They're not the athletic sort.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.301
They're more inclined to
intellectual pursuits. Besides...

05:45.379 --> 05:47.108
They're too old.

05:47.781 --> 05:51.114
The point is, Higgins, the bed's broken.
We can't push it anyway.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.311
We'll fix it.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.183
You fix it.
We've got things to do.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.313
All it needs is
a greater degree of velocity,

05:56.390 --> 05:57.550
greater maneuverability,

05:57.624 --> 05:59.387
a lower
center of gravity and...

06:04.431 --> 06:05.625
The judges.

06:05.966 --> 06:06.990
The what?

06:07.067 --> 06:08.694
The judges are here
to inspect the bed

06:08.769 --> 06:10.999
for final approval
prior to the race on Sunday.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.504
Magnum,
this wheel must be fixed.

06:12.573 --> 06:13.562
I implore you.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.342
Thomas Magnum?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.411
I'm Thomas Magnum.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.915
Lieutenant Jameson, sir.

06:23.117 --> 06:25.449
I have orders to ask you
to come back with me.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.012
Whose orders?

06:30.257 --> 06:33.317
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a highly classified matter.

06:33.394 --> 06:34.691
If you would
just come with me.

06:34.762 --> 06:35.786
It's urgent.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.160
That's absurd.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.859
You can't expect a man to get in
the car with a perfect stranger

06:39.933 --> 06:42.424
and drive off to God knows
where on the slender assurance

06:42.503 --> 06:43.868
that it's an urgent matter.

06:43.937 --> 06:47.168
Besides, he already has
an urgent commitment.

06:49.376 --> 06:50.900
That's all right, Higgins.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.309
Lieutenant.

06:53.947 --> 06:57.144
Magnum,
you can't just take off.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.283
What about the race?

06:59.953 --> 07:01.477
What about the bed?

07:01.555 --> 07:03.420
If I'm not back,
start without me.

07:12.065 --> 07:15.228
There are all kinds of
disadvantages to working for yourself.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.827
Pay isn't steady,
you can't count on vacations

07:17.905 --> 07:19.896
and you almost
never get a raise.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.270
But the advantage is

07:21.341 --> 07:23.036
you hardly ever
get the feeling

07:23.110 --> 07:25.578
you're trapped doing a job
you don't wanna do.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.276
But the minute I stepped
into that van,

07:28.348 --> 07:30.873
I began to have an uneasy
feeling that someone somewhere

07:30.951 --> 07:33.351
was about to pull
some heavy duty strings.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.791
If you would please, sir.
Walk over by the rail.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.454
Hello, Thomas.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.662
Admiral Hawkes.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.233
I'm sorry for all
the cloak and dagger,

08:27.307 --> 08:29.275
but I needed
to talk to you.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.873
You could've picked up a phone.
Uh-huh.

08:32.513 --> 08:35.880
Thomas, I have a hypothetical
question to ask you.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.678
Just for a moment
suppose you're me

08:39.019 --> 08:41.647
and you discover you have
a security leak at Pearl.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.085
Lately you've been losing
bits of coded data.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.888
It's serious,
but not critical.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.961
So you go about
the normal procedure

08:49.029 --> 08:51.259
of quietly trying to
ferret out the mole.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.799
With all due respect,
Admiral, I can't believe

08:53.867 --> 08:55.232
you brought me
all the way out here

08:55.302 --> 08:57.862
to discuss some
hypothetical security leak.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.235
Now you learn
that in three days time

09:01.308 --> 09:03.503
you're going to receive
the encoding manuals

09:03.744 --> 09:06.872
of a top secret nuclear sub
communications system.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.481
If those manuals get into the wrong
hands, it could be disastrous.

09:10.551 --> 09:13.247
But you can't trust
your own security section

09:14.121 --> 09:16.521
because any one of them
could be the mole.

09:17.457 --> 09:18.924
Well, what do you do?

09:19.693 --> 09:21.786
Call the FBl.
No, you wouldn't.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.930
Because the leak
could be there, too.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.324
Thomas,
welcome back to the Navy.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.398
You've just been recalled.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.505
What?

09:46.553 --> 09:48.020
What is this?

09:49.189 --> 09:51.987
It's a little matter of six
months time you still owe me.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.615
I lost those
six months for you

09:53.694 --> 09:55.753
when you wanted to get
out early, remember?

09:55.829 --> 09:57.262
Now I'm taking them back.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.492
You can't make this stick
and you know it.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.423
Well, I'm sure going to try.

10:01.535 --> 10:04.902
You drag me out here,
you give me this James Bond scenario

10:04.972 --> 10:06.371
and then you tell me
without my knowledge,

10:06.440 --> 10:08.374
you're throwing me
back in the Navy.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.774
I need your help.
What can I do?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.935
You could ask me,
for starters.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.007
All right. I'm asking.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.516
As a favor,
will you help me?

10:22.489 --> 10:24.150
You have the papers, Thomas.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.525
You do what
you think is right.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.395
Are you still with us?

10:40.574 --> 10:41.768
Dad?

10:42.676 --> 10:43.938
Oh. I'm sorry.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.572
Did you invite us
to lunch to ignore us or...

10:48.181 --> 10:49.512
No, of course not.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.312
Father of the groom jitters.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.248
Yeah, well, we've all got things to do.
Might as well get to them.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.812
Wait, Andy.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.687
There's something
I wanted to give you.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.784
Oh, Dad,
you're not gonna do that here, are you?

11:00.861 --> 11:02.260
You're darn right I am.

11:04.598 --> 11:06.225
Did Andy tell you
about this watch?

11:06.299 --> 11:07.459
No.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.796
Admiral Hawkes.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.504
Well,
Commander Magnum.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.038
I was expecting you
this morning.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.407
Your office told me
I might find you here.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.412
I want you to
meet my son, Andy,

11:20.614 --> 11:23.242
and my soon-to-be daughter-in-law,
Alex McPort.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.983
They're just one week
from the altar.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.986
Congratulations.
Thank you, Commander.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.514
Hello.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.487
I didn't realize you were
having a family lunch.

11:30.557 --> 11:31.546
We can talk later.

11:31.625 --> 11:34.059
No, no, no. Nonsense.
I want you to join us.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.288
We're just having
a little presentation.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.992
It's all right, really.
We were just leaving.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.890
Some of us have strict hours.

11:40.967 --> 11:44.095
Andy, you can stay five more
minutes for a photograph.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.601
If anybody complains,
just have them call me.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.866
Alex, I think this
is an excellent time

11:50.944 --> 11:53.674
for you to begin
the old family photo album.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.281
Well, all right.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.283
Why don't you read the
inscription to Thomas and Alex?

12:03.290 --> 12:04.450
Okay.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.987
Everybody ready? Smile.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.888
Well, go ahead
and read it.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.623
"To Lieutenant
Andrew Efraim Hawkes,

12:15.202 --> 12:17.796
"for valor above and beyond
the call of duty,

12:17.871 --> 12:21.136
"President Theodore Roosevelt,
3/14/01."

12:22.209 --> 12:23.369
He was quite a man.

12:23.443 --> 12:26.412
And now Andy's the fourth
generation to receive this watch.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.745
It's become a kind
of family tradition.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.009
We pass it on
just before the wedding.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.513
Thomas, why don't you take a
photograph of the three of us?

12:35.589 --> 12:36.920
Oh, yeah, sure.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.355
Dad, I really
have to leave.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.393
Just one photograph.
How long can that be?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.587
Alex, you don't mind Thomas
using your camera, do you?

12:42.662 --> 12:45.222
No, no, no, no. It's just a
little complicated, that's all.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.925
Oh, I'll give it a try.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.366
Let's look bright.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.374
Thomas, the kids
don't have all day.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.242
Oh, yeah.
Are you sure you're using 400 ASA?

13:01.047 --> 13:02.139
What?

13:08.355 --> 13:10.084
Oh, wait, hold up the watch.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.856
That's great.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.449
There you go. Smile.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.223
Thank you.
Come on, I'll get you back.

13:17.597 --> 13:18.723
Well.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.956
Thanks for the lunch,
Admiral.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.524
Anytime.
It was a pleasure.

13:23.170 --> 13:27.004
Dad,
thank you for the watch.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.672
Son, you're welcome.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.310
Goodbye.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.681
Bye.
- Goodbye.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.589
Pretty girl.
She work around here?

13:46.860 --> 13:49.090
Yes, she's a civilian
contractor to the Navy.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.191
Weather operations.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.125
Only been here
about six months.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.029
It's been
a whirlwind romance.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.160
But, he feels
she's the gal for him.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.027
So what can I say?

13:59.105 --> 14:00.834
I'm just his father.

14:01.942 --> 14:05.070
Thomas, thanks for coming.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.178
Well, when you
put it as a favor,

14:08.248 --> 14:09.715
how can I turn you down?

14:11.718 --> 14:13.242
Where do we start?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.918
With anybody you think
might be the mole.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.322
I have a list.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.651
I know what you're thinking.
And you're right.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.384
If Admiral Hawkes
had a list of suspects,

14:51.458 --> 14:53.483
why wasn't I tracking them
down instead of waiting

14:53.560 --> 14:55.585
to tail his soon-to-be
daughter-in-law?

14:59.099 --> 15:00.657
I didn't have
an answer to that.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.463
But my little voice
was telling me

15:02.535 --> 15:04.969
that Alex wasn't quite
what she appeared to be.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.006
I couldn't put my finger on it,
but there was something

15:07.073 --> 15:09.234
about her being
a few years older than Andy,

15:09.309 --> 15:11.174
her whirlwind romance
with him

15:11.244 --> 15:13.906
and the fact that she'd carry
around a complicated camera

15:13.980 --> 15:16.744
but didn't appear to know
an F-stop from a bus stop.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.114
All that led me to wonder
what she was doing here.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.949
And as I followed her
in her very expensive car,

15:22.022 --> 15:23.785
I began to wonder
how she managed to stretch

15:23.857 --> 15:25.791
a civil servant's salary
so far.

16:19.262 --> 16:23.392
"Roll on, thou deep
and dark blue ocean roll

16:24.133 --> 16:28.035
"Ten thousand fleets
sweep over thee in vain

16:28.738 --> 16:31.605
"Man marks
the earth with ruin

16:32.008 --> 16:35.171
"Yet his control
stops at the shore"

16:36.212 --> 16:37.406
Lord Byron.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.750
Some things
never seem to change.

16:45.955 --> 16:48.549
"The man
doesn't choose the sea.

16:48.624 --> 16:50.592
"The sea chooses the man."

16:51.761 --> 16:53.319
Who said that?

16:53.629 --> 16:54.789
I'm not sure.

16:55.998 --> 16:57.898
I heard it from my dad.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.704
When Andy
came into the service,

17:06.776 --> 17:09.300
I thought it would bring
us a lot closer together.

17:10.813 --> 17:13.247
But it seems to have
driven a wedge between us.

17:15.483 --> 17:17.952
He's trapped in the lnspector
General's Office,

17:18.854 --> 17:21.617
yet he won't accept my help
in getting him a transfer.

17:22.992 --> 17:25.517
He insists on doing
everything the hard way.

17:28.764 --> 17:31.665
Well, we didn't come all the
way out here to discuss my son.

17:33.736 --> 17:35.363
What's the bad news?

17:38.040 --> 17:40.133
I'm not sure it's bad news.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.501
Consider it a report.

17:43.245 --> 17:44.439
Report.

17:47.083 --> 17:48.641
I witnessed a drop.

17:49.552 --> 17:50.780
And?

17:54.156 --> 17:56.647
How well do you
know Andy's fiancée?

17:58.527 --> 17:59.687
Alex?

18:00.730 --> 18:03.062
No. Couldn't be.

18:06.636 --> 18:09.935
How could she possibly get her
hands on classified material?

18:12.108 --> 18:14.201
That's what l
need to find out.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.206
I have to
get close to her.

18:19.615 --> 18:21.515
She's in the
communications building.

18:22.752 --> 18:24.447
Department of Meteorology.

18:25.821 --> 18:28.881
Thomas, report to me tonight.

18:29.158 --> 18:30.489
2200 hours.

18:47.309 --> 18:48.435
Hi.

18:48.511 --> 18:50.274
Commander Magnum.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.514
No, you can just
call me commander.

18:52.815 --> 18:54.282
No, it's Thomas.

18:54.950 --> 18:56.781
I heard this is
where you worked.

18:56.852 --> 18:58.444
I was hoping
I'd catch you here.

18:58.521 --> 19:00.421
Is there something
I can help you with?

19:00.489 --> 19:01.547
No.

19:01.824 --> 19:02.813
No.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.250
I don't know.

19:06.362 --> 19:09.297
I'm kind of stuck here
between orders, you know.

19:11.167 --> 19:12.759
I was getting
a little bored.

19:14.470 --> 19:18.099
Well, lonely,
if you wanna know the truth and I just,

19:19.075 --> 19:22.340
thought that if you were
stuck here working late,

19:25.247 --> 19:27.238
that maybe you'd
like a little company.

19:28.918 --> 19:32.547
Well, I was just about to
close up shop for the day.

19:32.822 --> 19:34.289
Oh, just my luck.

19:43.232 --> 19:44.494
Hey.

19:45.501 --> 19:47.401
I've got this buddy in Guam.

19:47.737 --> 19:50.205
Can I use this computer
to access in to his?

19:50.439 --> 19:53.169
It's possible. If you have
the right security clearance.

19:53.576 --> 19:55.168
Do you have
security clearance?

19:55.244 --> 19:56.711
No, no.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.474
I was hoping you will.

19:58.547 --> 19:59.980
No, I'm just a weather lady.

20:00.049 --> 20:01.573
No need for security.

20:02.084 --> 20:03.210
Oh.

20:04.887 --> 20:08.084
Well, since I can't talk
to my friend in Guam,

20:08.157 --> 20:10.682
what are the chances
of buying you a cup of coffee?

20:17.700 --> 20:21.568
Maybe you didn't understand,
but Andy and I are engaged.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.502
I know,
it's just a cup of coffee.

20:24.406 --> 20:26.306
Besides, you're not married.

20:26.542 --> 20:27.702
Yet.

20:29.678 --> 20:31.077
A cup of coffee.

20:31.447 --> 20:32.971
A little conversation.

20:36.085 --> 20:39.145
You know, I haven't had anybody to
talk to either since I got here,

20:39.221 --> 20:40.848
except for Andy, of course.

20:40.923 --> 20:42.185
I'd love to.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.085
You choose the place.

20:45.628 --> 20:46.856
Okay.

20:50.733 --> 20:53.293
Playing on people's
emotions to get information

20:53.369 --> 20:56.202
was one part of intelligence
work I never liked.

20:56.272 --> 20:58.502
The fact that Alex McPort
was so likeable

20:58.574 --> 21:00.940
and at the same time engaged
to my good friend's son

21:01.010 --> 21:02.409
made it that much tougher.

21:03.379 --> 21:05.244
Somehow even knowing
that the information

21:05.314 --> 21:07.407
was vitally important
didn't make it any easier.

21:07.483 --> 21:08.745
Then I just
decided one day

21:08.818 --> 21:10.479
I didn't wanna
spend the rest of my life

21:10.553 --> 21:13.147
being the weather girl
in north-forsaken Montana.

21:13.389 --> 21:15.482
North-forsaken Montana?

21:15.558 --> 21:17.583
Yeah, my word for it.

21:19.028 --> 21:22.623
One more winter and I think I would
have turned into the abominable snowman.

21:24.166 --> 21:25.861
So I took
a civil service test,

21:25.935 --> 21:27.163
passed it,

21:27.803 --> 21:30.431
sold all my stuff
and moved to Paradise.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.133
Bought a Porsche,
fell in love.

21:32.308 --> 21:34.208
Ah, no, it was
the other way around.

21:34.276 --> 21:35.800
Porsche was Andy's idea.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.708
You know, I used to worry about
what people would think of me

21:39.782 --> 21:42.376
so I ended up not doing
very much of anything.

21:43.586 --> 21:47.522
Now, here I am, driving a Porsche,
marrying a younger man.

21:48.824 --> 21:50.086
Tell me, Thomas,

21:50.793 --> 21:53.660
do you think the folks back in
north-forsaken would approve?

21:54.463 --> 21:56.090
So what if they don't?

21:56.165 --> 21:57.359
Alex?

21:58.200 --> 21:59.326
Andy.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.164
What's going on here?

22:01.270 --> 22:03.830
We were just gonna have a cup of coffee.
You wanna join us?

22:03.906 --> 22:06.306
No. No, I don't think so.
Alex, let's go.

22:06.375 --> 22:09.071
Andy, please.
This is not... Alex, let's go.

22:12.047 --> 22:13.241
Andy.

22:14.783 --> 22:16.842
I don't wish to start
anything, Commander,

22:17.653 --> 22:19.382
but get your own girl.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.054
Well, I would think you'd
have used a little discretion.

22:27.129 --> 22:28.357
Discretion?

22:28.430 --> 22:31.263
Yes, you take that girl out in the
public where anybody could see you.

22:31.333 --> 22:34.234
If you're talking about Andy,
he obviously followed her.

22:34.737 --> 22:37.069
Are you telling me that
my son just sits in his car,

22:37.139 --> 22:38.436
waiting to spy
on his fiancée?

22:38.507 --> 22:39.838
I don't know
what Andy's doing.

22:39.909 --> 22:41.240
It's Alex
I'm worried about.

22:41.310 --> 22:42.641
Now, I don't think
we can give it any more time.

22:42.711 --> 22:44.406
I think
we have to pick her up.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.640
On what grounds?

22:45.714 --> 22:47.443
I witnessed a drop.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.513
Did you see any papers?
No.

22:49.885 --> 22:52.649
Do you have any hard evidence
of any security breach?

22:52.721 --> 22:54.382
You know what I saw.

22:54.456 --> 22:57.584
You saw one camera case
being exchanged for another.

22:57.660 --> 22:59.924
Under very
suspicious circumstances.

22:59.995 --> 23:01.758
Suspicious,
but not conclusive.

23:01.830 --> 23:04.128
But reasonable.
For questioning.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.960
Thomas,

23:06.635 --> 23:09.001
if I pull her in now,
she's gonna deny everything

23:09.071 --> 23:11.539
and we're gonna
lose her and her contacts.

23:11.740 --> 23:13.435
No. We have to wait.

23:13.509 --> 23:14.942
For what?

23:15.010 --> 23:16.568
For the manuals to arrive.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.409
And then if someone goes after
them and tries to deliver them...

23:19.481 --> 23:20.914
Not someone. Alex.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.349
Now, I can't believe you put
the whole system in jeopardy

23:23.419 --> 23:24.852
on the chance you're
gonna catch her in the act.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.512
She's much too smart
for that.

23:27.089 --> 23:28.351
It's a risk
we're gonna have to take.

23:28.424 --> 23:30.221
Because she's
your son's fiancée?

23:30.626 --> 23:31.752
No.

23:34.296 --> 23:36.992
Admiral, do you really
want her contacts?

23:37.433 --> 23:39.731
Or are you just
protecting Andy?

23:42.972 --> 23:44.530
And what if
we're wrong about her?

23:44.606 --> 23:46.267
What if we're not?

23:47.676 --> 23:49.803
The manuals arrive
tomorrow morning.

23:50.179 --> 23:51.373
We wait.

24:08.330 --> 24:09.456
Hey!

24:24.880 --> 24:26.939
Hey, come on! You win.

24:34.289 --> 24:35.654
Open this vehicle up.

24:37.026 --> 24:38.391
Lieutenant Jameson.

24:38.460 --> 24:40.690
I caught this guy breaking
into that Mercedes.

24:42.431 --> 24:44.456
What are they doing?
That's my car!

24:53.509 --> 24:56.069
I'm sorry, Commander,
you'll have to come with us.

24:56.145 --> 24:58.739
You're under arrest
for suspicion of espionage.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.803
Look,
I can't go into details...

25:10.875 --> 25:12.240
But this
is all a big mistake.

25:12.310 --> 25:13.777
I have to talk
to Admiral Hawkes.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.506
You had
your one phone call, sir.

25:15.580 --> 25:17.343
He didn't answer.
You know that.

25:17.415 --> 25:20.043
Well, that's not really the
Navy's problem, is it, Commander?

25:20.118 --> 25:22.143
You don't get one
dime and that's it.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.780
Well, well, well.

25:28.493 --> 25:30.586
They locked up
the traitor at last.

25:32.263 --> 25:33.491
Who are you?

25:34.098 --> 25:35.326
Me?

25:35.600 --> 25:37.727
Just a guy who works nights,
that's all.

25:38.069 --> 25:39.366
A car thief.

25:39.504 --> 25:40.937
Something like that.

25:41.005 --> 25:44.065
Who bypasses all of Waikiki
to sneak onto a military base

25:44.142 --> 25:45.734
and hotwire officers' cars.

25:48.579 --> 25:50.479
Everybody's got
their specialty,

25:50.781 --> 25:51.975
I guess.

25:52.049 --> 25:54.244
I boost cars,
you boost state secrets.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.080
Maybe.

25:56.787 --> 25:58.652
Maybe you weren't really
stealing that Mercedes.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.850
Maybe you were planting
something on me.

26:02.093 --> 26:03.458
That's good.

26:03.794 --> 26:05.125
That's real good.

26:05.196 --> 26:06.993
Put the blame
on somebody else.

26:07.265 --> 26:08.755
Only it's not gonna stick.

26:09.367 --> 26:10.629
See, as soon as
the local cops

26:10.701 --> 26:12.464
come and get me,
I'm bailed out.

26:12.703 --> 26:15.103
You just got in
the way of my work, pal.

26:15.239 --> 26:16.729
I'm a repo man.

26:16.874 --> 26:17.966
Had to sneak on the base.

26:18.042 --> 26:20.340
That's where the car was
I was supposed to pick up.

26:20.411 --> 26:21.776
Then why'd you run?

26:22.480 --> 26:25.005
Well, I thought you were
the owner of the Mercedes.

26:25.082 --> 26:27.380
I usually don't stick around
for small talk.

26:28.085 --> 26:30.246
Maybe you planted
something on me.

26:32.290 --> 26:33.780
That's a good one.

26:34.258 --> 26:35.452
You might try that, though,

26:35.526 --> 26:37.118
on the next guy
they bring in here.

26:37.195 --> 26:38.890
He might not have an alibi.

26:45.503 --> 26:47.471
Commander Magnum,
you should be aware

26:47.538 --> 26:50.666
this is merely
a preliminary investigation

26:51.409 --> 26:54.674
to determine if a general
court martial is warranted.

26:55.213 --> 26:57.613
Now, have you had an
opportunity to consult with

26:57.682 --> 27:00.480
Lieutenant Commander Banks,
your defense attorney?

27:00.551 --> 27:01.848
Yes, sir.

27:01.919 --> 27:03.853
Very well,
then let's proceed.

27:04.422 --> 27:06.219
Lieutenant Commander Dantley.

27:07.058 --> 27:10.892
Commander, you don't
deny that it was your car

27:10.995 --> 27:13.725
in which the top secret
silicon communications chips

27:13.931 --> 27:15.762
and support data was found?

27:16.334 --> 27:18.097
No, I don't deny
they were there.

27:18.169 --> 27:19.727
Where did the data come from?

27:20.404 --> 27:23.134
I don't know.
They were planted in my car.

27:23.407 --> 27:26.501
Are there other
Navy personnel involved?

27:26.877 --> 27:30.074
No. I mean, I don't know

27:30.214 --> 27:32.944
and I'm not gonna find out unless
I can talk to Admiral Hawkes.

27:33.017 --> 27:34.917
Is Admiral Hawkes
your contact?

27:41.225 --> 27:42.624
Do you report to him?

27:47.798 --> 27:49.823
I don't report to anybody.

27:50.668 --> 27:53.228
You know, Commander,
the evidence against you

27:53.304 --> 27:54.965
is pretty damaging.

27:55.973 --> 27:58.567
We are questioning
Admiral Hawkes now.

27:59.577 --> 28:01.306
Anything you can
tell us about him

28:01.379 --> 28:04.007
would go a long ways
toward helping you.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.080
Very well.

28:11.656 --> 28:13.783
I have no other choice,
but to recommend

28:13.858 --> 28:15.849
that charges of espionage
against you be referred

28:15.926 --> 28:18.793
to a general court-martial
for trial.

28:19.930 --> 28:22.194
And I might remind you,
Commander,

28:22.833 --> 28:26.269
the maximum penalty for such
a crime is life imprisonment.

28:28.839 --> 28:31.273
Now if you think of anything
you'd like to tell us.

29:02.540 --> 29:03.973
Well, what is this?

29:04.041 --> 29:05.872
You're not doing
the talking here.

29:05.943 --> 29:07.137
We're talking?

29:07.211 --> 29:10.078
I got half the base thinking I'm
implicated with you and the Admiral,

29:10.147 --> 29:12.240
just because I've been
seen with the two of you.

29:12.316 --> 29:15.012
I'm not real interested
in your problems.

29:15.386 --> 29:18.617
As far as I'm concerned,
you're the lowest life-form there is.

29:18.889 --> 29:20.982
A traitor to your country

29:21.058 --> 29:23.458
and I intend to give you
what you deserve.

29:23.527 --> 29:24.994
For the sake of my country.

29:25.062 --> 29:27.587
And for the sake
of my own good name.

29:28.332 --> 29:29.799
You think
you can take me on?

29:29.867 --> 29:31.334
Fine. Come on.

30:33.497 --> 30:35.658
At least this ought
to clear your good name.

31:14.939 --> 31:16.429
One thing
I learned in the Navy

31:16.507 --> 31:19.772
is what happens to your mind when
you're put in a survival situation.

31:20.177 --> 31:22.407
Every image and sound
is slowed down.

31:22.480 --> 31:25.176
Every reaction is considered,
weighed carefully,

31:25.249 --> 31:26.443
until you know, for sure,

31:26.517 --> 31:28.178
what your move
is going to be.

31:31.956 --> 31:34.220
Because if your
first shot fails,

31:34.525 --> 31:36.288
you may not get
a second chance.

31:47.838 --> 31:49.965
Lieutenant,
everything okay?

31:50.374 --> 31:51.466
Lieutenant!

31:53.410 --> 31:54.707
Call the gate.

32:34.985 --> 32:37.112
Another thing
I've learned about survival,

32:37.187 --> 32:38.654
if your first
move is successful,

32:38.722 --> 32:41.020
keep going as fast
and as hard as you can.

32:41.091 --> 32:43.559
Don't look back
until you're out of danger.

32:50.167 --> 32:52.397
I knew I had to start
at Alex's apartment.

32:52.503 --> 32:54.664
She was the most
likely suspect.

32:54.738 --> 32:57.206
But my little voice
kept nagging at me.

32:57.274 --> 32:59.799
Maybe Alex had arranged
the plant in my car.

33:00.244 --> 33:02.212
But who had turned in
Admiral Hawkes?

33:06.216 --> 33:08.241
If there was a clue
in her apartment,

33:08.319 --> 33:09.911
it was going to
be hard to find.

33:09.987 --> 33:11.545
There was
nothing out of place.

33:11.622 --> 33:13.556
The requisite
family photograph.

33:13.624 --> 33:16.092
But no telephone/address book
lying around.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.287
No bank statements.
No junk mail.

33:18.362 --> 33:20.091
No childhood mementoes.

33:20.164 --> 33:23.793
Everything had a manufactured
quality to it.

33:24.034 --> 33:27.367
Even the college diploma in
Communications and Broadcast Journalism.

33:27.438 --> 33:31.033
It was as if
Alex McPort was born yesterday.

33:31.609 --> 33:34.373
Which, I realized,
was exactly the case.

33:46.857 --> 33:48.085
Nice place.

33:50.260 --> 33:52.785
Did you learn that
in weathergirl school?

33:57.592 --> 33:59.096
You're not going
to call the police, are you?

33:59.168 --> 34:02.331
Because then we'll have a
whole lot of explaining to do.

34:02.405 --> 34:03.804
Like who we really are.

34:04.874 --> 34:06.364
You're very good.

34:07.210 --> 34:08.643
I'd say FBl.

34:09.712 --> 34:11.839
Hello, Operator.
May I help you?

34:15.184 --> 34:16.481
I thought so.

34:19.121 --> 34:21.487
Which means
our security leak

34:21.556 --> 34:23.547
has to be the one person
you got close to.

34:23.626 --> 34:24.614
Andy.

34:25.561 --> 34:27.620
I don't suppose you'd
like to tell me where he is?

34:27.697 --> 34:29.790
This is your scenario.
You tell me.

34:29.866 --> 34:32.096
Well, I have some theories.

34:32.467 --> 34:34.800
I figure after our
little scene last night,

34:34.871 --> 34:38.204
he had a friend plant some very
incriminating evidence in my car.

34:38.940 --> 34:41.808
Then he must've waited
to get the encoding manuals

34:41.878 --> 34:43.344
the minute
they arrived on base

34:43.413 --> 34:45.005
and their disappearance
would be reason enough

34:45.081 --> 34:46.672
for the Navy to
question Admiral Hawkes.

34:46.748 --> 34:49.149
Now, why didn't you tell him
his own son was involved?

34:49.217 --> 34:51.277
He had no need to know.
No need to know.

34:53.822 --> 34:55.984
How can you
people operate like that?

34:56.059 --> 34:58.653
Before you start throwing
around accusations, Commander,

34:58.728 --> 35:00.719
you might want to consider
that your interference

35:00.797 --> 35:03.288
has just cost me six months
of deep cover work.

35:03.366 --> 35:06.858
And has probably cost our country
its most vital communication link.

35:14.544 --> 35:16.512
All the way back
to Admiral Hawkes' office,

35:16.579 --> 35:18.206
I wrestled with my emotions.

35:18.281 --> 35:19.714
I knew that I'd been set up.

35:19.782 --> 35:21.579
That someone had tipped off
the base police

35:21.651 --> 35:23.642
about the silicone chips
in my car

35:23.720 --> 35:26.985
and that someone had kept Admiral
Hawkes busy so he couldn't help me out.

35:27.056 --> 35:29.786
But you learn to expect that
kind of stuff in my business.

35:30.860 --> 35:32.521
What was bothering me

35:32.729 --> 35:35.892
was that Admiral Hawkes had
been set up by his own son

35:36.365 --> 35:38.128
and I hadn't seen it coming.

35:40.336 --> 35:42.770
Yes, sir.
We are related.

35:45.007 --> 35:46.201
He's my son.

35:49.612 --> 35:50.874
Well, apparently,

35:51.147 --> 35:53.809
the encoding manuals
were breached

35:54.450 --> 35:56.418
from the lnspector
General's Office

35:56.486 --> 35:58.215
sometime early this morning.

36:01.357 --> 36:03.757
And the personnel that I
had working on the case

36:04.427 --> 36:06.327
were temporarily
indisposed.

36:09.298 --> 36:10.424
Yes, sir.

36:10.833 --> 36:12.460
Agent Karnes is right here.

36:14.303 --> 36:16.828
Very well, sir. Goodbye.

36:21.010 --> 36:22.910
We've been
ordered to do nothing.

36:24.213 --> 36:26.374
The Shore Patrol
and the local police

36:26.449 --> 36:29.145
are covering all the
airports and the boat basins.

36:30.486 --> 36:33.182
And you are to standby
for a call from your director.

36:34.190 --> 36:37.455
While Andy transfers the encoding
manuals over to the other side?

36:37.760 --> 36:39.125
Not a chance.

36:39.195 --> 36:42.961
I was sent here to find whoever was
selling us out and to bring him in,

36:43.032 --> 36:46.024
and I intend to do exactly that
before the trail gets cold.

36:46.469 --> 36:48.664
You're talking about his son.

36:49.772 --> 36:51.364
I'm talking about my job.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.772
Is that all you people
care about? Your job?

36:54.210 --> 36:55.677
She's right, Thomas.

36:56.846 --> 36:59.679
Perhaps if I had done
my job as a father better.

36:59.749 --> 37:02.149
I'm sorry, Admiral.
I just don't buy that.

37:02.685 --> 37:05.449
Whatever Andy did,
I'm sure he did it for his own reasons.

37:05.822 --> 37:07.949
And I wish to God
I knew what they were.

37:10.626 --> 37:12.719
Well, maybe we can find out.

37:13.729 --> 37:15.697
With all due respect,
Admiral,

37:15.765 --> 37:18.165
I don't think I can be
ordered to do anything anymore

37:18.234 --> 37:19.428
and I think we should try and find him

37:19.502 --> 37:21.026
before he makes
the situation worse.

37:21.904 --> 37:23.633
You said something
about a trail?

37:23.706 --> 37:24.968
It was your interference

37:25.041 --> 37:27.441
that blew this investigation
in the first place.

37:27.510 --> 37:28.841
I work alone.

37:29.078 --> 37:30.545
I'll find him myself.

37:30.613 --> 37:32.547
With all due respect,
Commander...

37:33.049 --> 37:35.847
Oh, I guess I can't
call you that anymore,

37:35.918 --> 37:38.512
but, with all due respect,

37:38.621 --> 37:40.452
just how do you
plan to do that?

37:40.523 --> 37:42.514
I've been finding people
on this island for six years.

37:42.592 --> 37:43.752
I'll manage.

37:44.427 --> 37:45.655
Admiral.

38:33.276 --> 38:34.868
In six years I'd learned

38:34.944 --> 38:36.775
there are all kinds
of ways of finding people.

38:36.846 --> 38:39.679
Looking up records,
talking to friends and family,

38:39.849 --> 38:41.282
frequenting known hangouts.

38:41.350 --> 38:43.580
But the best way,
when you could work it,

38:43.653 --> 38:46.247
was to let someone
lead you to your suspect.

38:46.322 --> 38:47.949
I was surprised that Alex,

38:48.024 --> 38:51.084
Agent Karnes,
hadn't learned that trick of the trade.

39:02.772 --> 39:04.034
What did you do?

39:04.340 --> 39:08.174
Show the desk clerk your badge and
threaten him with 40 years in Leavenworth?

39:08.244 --> 39:09.404
It worked.

39:09.779 --> 39:12.111
I thought you were out
finding Andy on your own.

39:12.181 --> 39:13.409
I am.

39:14.617 --> 39:16.676
Oh, don't pay any
attention to me.

39:19.121 --> 39:20.349
Tell me something.

39:21.657 --> 39:24.353
Just how far would you have
gone to get Andy's contacts?

39:24.427 --> 39:25.621
All the way to the altar?

39:25.695 --> 39:27.856
I'm a professional
doing my job.

39:28.431 --> 39:30.422
A job that includes
marrying a guy

39:30.499 --> 39:32.160
just to get
the information you want?

39:32.234 --> 39:34.600
I think you've been watching
too many lngrid Bergman movies.

39:34.670 --> 39:36.103
Oh, and you.

39:36.172 --> 39:37.571
You're so different?

39:38.074 --> 39:39.598
The invitation to dinner.

39:39.675 --> 39:42.439
The oh-so-calculated charm.

39:42.611 --> 39:46.047
"I'm bored, a little lonely,
just a cup of coffee."

39:46.449 --> 39:49.441
How far would you have gone,
just for information?

39:54.991 --> 39:57.084
What's the point
in fighting about it?

39:57.159 --> 39:59.457
It's all screwed up anyway.
There's nothing here.

39:59.895 --> 40:01.294
Yes, there is.

40:01.364 --> 40:03.025
We're just not seeing it.

40:12.074 --> 40:13.268
You have a pencil?

40:13.342 --> 40:14.400
No.

40:14.477 --> 40:15.705
A quarter?

40:16.145 --> 40:18.113
What?
A quarter. A dime.

40:18.180 --> 40:20.444
A Susan B. Anthony dollar.
Anything.

40:20.516 --> 40:22.245
Maybe. What for?

40:22.318 --> 40:24.445
There's a page missing
from this directory.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.614
Somebody wrote on it and left
an impression on the next page.

40:29.558 --> 40:30.923
A bobby pin.

40:32.061 --> 40:33.426
A bobby pin!

40:51.614 --> 40:53.206
Stand clear.
What?

40:53.516 --> 40:54.540
Don't!

41:07.296 --> 41:09.423
I thought that went out
with Dick Tracy.

41:10.966 --> 41:11.955
Mmm-hmm.

41:13.436 --> 41:15.028
What does it say?

41:15.805 --> 41:17.272
We've got to
get back to Pearl.

41:17.339 --> 41:19.273
I can run this through
the cryptographic computer.

41:19.341 --> 41:21.036
Let's hope it's a breakable code,
not some sort of...

41:21.110 --> 41:23.305
It's breakable. The top line's a code.
The bottom's the answer.

41:23.379 --> 41:25.574
I know that. But the bottom
part doesn't make any sense.

41:25.648 --> 41:27.138
The Carol Kai Bed Race.
Come on.

41:27.216 --> 41:28.410
What?

41:28.484 --> 41:31.214
The Carol Kai Bed Race.
The obstacle course at 4:30.

41:31.287 --> 41:33.517
Now, you can go with me or go
back and play with your computer.

41:33.589 --> 41:34.578
I'm gone.

41:42.865 --> 41:44.662
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

41:44.733 --> 41:47.497
Welcome to the first annual
Carol Kai...

41:47.570 --> 41:50.869
I can't believe that Magnum is
on Maui the day of the big race.

41:50.940 --> 41:51.998
Not to worry, Higgins.

41:52.074 --> 41:55.532
We've got everything
under control.

41:55.611 --> 41:57.704
Yeah.
We're not exactly helpless without him.

41:57.780 --> 42:01.511
Nevertheless, it is irresponsible, thoughtless,
and completely unprofessional.

42:01.584 --> 42:03.051
In short...

42:11.660 --> 42:12.991
There he is.

42:15.998 --> 42:17.522
I don't believe it.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.497
Nice going.

42:29.745 --> 42:30.837
Magnum?

42:30.913 --> 42:33.006
T.C., pay attention, man!
Let's go.

42:37.486 --> 42:39.818
There's somebody
I'd really like to talk to.

42:39.889 --> 42:41.186
Who is he?

42:41.257 --> 42:42.986
The guy who planted
those papers in my car.

42:43.058 --> 42:44.616
Andy's contact.

42:44.693 --> 42:48.220
Did they teach you about pincer
movements at that weathergirl school?

42:48.297 --> 42:50.458
Let's go.
I'll take Andy. You...

42:51.967 --> 42:53.229
Oh, no!

43:02.511 --> 43:03.535
I knew
we could do it.

43:03.612 --> 43:05.136
We still have
the semis and finals.

43:05.781 --> 43:06.873
T.C.?

43:09.785 --> 43:12.720
I thought I saw Thomas Magnum
in uniform.

43:14.590 --> 43:17.582
We'd better queue up
for the semi-finals. Let's go.

43:32.107 --> 43:33.404
Andy.

43:33.475 --> 43:34.464
Son,

43:34.977 --> 43:36.569
it has to stop here.

43:37.446 --> 43:39.175
Give me those manuals.

43:40.649 --> 43:43.049
For whatever reason
you've done what you've done,

43:43.118 --> 43:45.143
I'll stand by you.
I promise you.

43:45.221 --> 43:47.052
How utterly touching.

43:47.957 --> 43:49.891
I wish I could stay
and hear the rest.

43:49.959 --> 43:52.689
But, right now, I think you'd
just better give me that case.

43:53.062 --> 43:54.586
Andy, don't.
Now.

43:54.930 --> 43:56.295
Hey!

43:56.599 --> 43:58.089
No!

43:58.534 --> 43:59.967
Hold it!

44:04.873 --> 44:06.272
Call an ambulance!

44:16.151 --> 44:17.413
It is him!

44:17.486 --> 44:18.748
It can't be!

44:25.194 --> 44:26.388
All right!

44:40.242 --> 44:41.800
Only one more race.

44:41.944 --> 44:43.912
Buck up, chaps.
We're nearly there.

44:43.979 --> 44:45.003
Okay, tell me,
we didn't see it.

44:45.080 --> 44:47.514
Oh, it's the heat.
It's gotta be an optical illusion.

44:47.583 --> 44:49.073
Yeah, right.
What're you talking about?

44:49.151 --> 44:50.618
Come on! Last race!

45:19.915 --> 45:21.405
You're going
to be all right?

45:21.483 --> 45:22.643
I'll be fine.

45:22.718 --> 45:24.049
Ready, Admiral?

45:28.691 --> 45:29.988
One moment.

45:30.793 --> 45:31.987
Son,

45:36.532 --> 45:38.159
why did you do it?

45:41.036 --> 45:42.469
I don't know really.
