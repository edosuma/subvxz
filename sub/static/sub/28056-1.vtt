<i>Well, Jimmy,
racing has a heck of a lot</i>

03:08.845 --> 03:11.679
<i>to do with the driver,
but you gotta have the car</i>

03:11.681 --> 03:13.013
<i>to back it up on the track.</i>

03:13.015 --> 03:15.616
<i>Yeah. The Munroe
car is fast when it runs,</i>

03:15.618 --> 03:18.052
<i>but it's been plagued by engine
problems all season,</i>

03:18.054 --> 03:21.990

04:14.911 --> 04:16.512
What a good day for you.

04:18.380 --> 04:21.851
David, do you mind helping
Cam load up his car?

04:22.552 --> 04:23.720
I gotta go to work.

04:28.458 --> 04:30.394
Super!

04:32.029 --> 04:32.963
All right.

04:37.935 --> 04:38.869
Whoo!

05:18.977 --> 05:20.544
We're ready for you.

06:12.964 --> 06:14.098
<i>Pick your weapon.</i>

06:14.498 --> 06:17.602
- Uh... Gold.
- Gold, all right.

06:18.136 --> 06:19.068
Bait your hook.

06:19.070 --> 06:21.170
I'm not gonna have
to touch a worm, am I?

06:21.172 --> 06:24.642
Hell no! I don't use worms,
I use hot dogs.

06:25.743 --> 06:28.045
- Pinch a little off like that.
- Okay.

06:28.047 --> 06:31.114
And we take our hook, you gotta
be careful with the hook,

06:31.116 --> 06:33.183
and we just hook it on real good

06:33.185 --> 06:35.818
so it doesn't fall off.
All right.

06:35.820 --> 06:37.188
Now, stand up.

06:39.290 --> 06:41.791
Now, I'm gonna come
and reach around you like this.

06:41.793 --> 06:44.163
- Mm-hm.
- I like this part.

06:46.931 --> 06:49.767
Now, seriously, why did you
move down here?

06:49.969 --> 06:52.171
- After the divorce...
- Yeah.

06:52.838 --> 06:56.507
...I just... I just needed to
get away from Steve and...

06:57.810 --> 07:00.710
and everything that reminded me
of our life together, you know?

07:00.712 --> 07:02.947
- Mm-hm.
- When I got offered

07:03.781 --> 07:05.815
the teaching job
at a reasonable salary

07:05.817 --> 07:11.023
in this quaint little town,
I jumped at the chance.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.558
Well, I sure am glad you did.

07:14.593 --> 07:15.627
Yeah, me too.

07:17.997 --> 07:19.598
I opened up. What about you?

07:20.733 --> 07:21.934
Mm-hm.

07:25.170 --> 07:26.869
We don't have
to talk about that.

07:26.871 --> 07:29.274
No. it's all right.
You're right.

07:29.808 --> 07:31.977
You told me your story.
Why can't I tell you mine?

07:32.878 --> 07:35.714
Um... Jen and I,
we grew up together,

07:36.148 --> 07:38.217
and she was
the first girl I kissed.

07:39.952 --> 07:42.122
You know, we always knew
we were gonna get married,

07:43.223 --> 07:47.526
and... she saw something
in me that nobody else did,

07:47.993 --> 07:50.827
including my father.
I mean, I felt like

07:50.829 --> 07:55.000
I could win races
and bag trophies, and...

07:55.768 --> 07:57.002
and I did for a while.

08:01.307 --> 08:02.308
What happened?

08:04.177 --> 08:07.080
Well, she... she died and...
and, uh, it was, uh,

08:07.781 --> 08:10.014
- it was in a car accident.
- I'm sorry.

08:10.016 --> 08:11.017
No, no, no.

08:11.984 --> 08:13.152
It's a part of me, you know.

08:15.921 --> 08:17.621
I don't know why,
I just thought of this.

08:17.623 --> 08:18.857
When I was senior
in high school,

08:20.126 --> 08:23.860
my friend Stumpy and I, we got
kicked out of school for doing

08:23.862 --> 08:25.298
donuts in the parking lot.

08:26.099 --> 08:28.802
And, uh, it was my dad's
'64 Galaxy.

08:29.335 --> 08:31.636
And, uh... Just 'cause you

08:31.638 --> 08:33.171
talked about school,
or it just stirred up

08:33.173 --> 08:35.174
- a school memory or something.
- What are donuts?

08:36.975 --> 08:38.811
Mm.

08:44.818 --> 08:48.352
You like it? I've never done
one before.

08:48.354 --> 08:50.924
- Oh!
- This is my first time.

08:51.124 --> 08:52.424
Oh, great!

09:07.974 --> 09:09.042
Hey, champ!

09:10.143 --> 09:11.678
Is that supposed to be funny?

09:13.980 --> 09:15.648
Depends on how you
look at it, I guess.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.318
I could see you're all
pissed off,

09:19.320 --> 09:21.654
and I guess I would be too
if I was you.

09:21.922 --> 09:22.890
What's that supposed to mean?

09:24.090 --> 09:25.692
It just means that you got
a whole bunch of talent, son...

09:26.826 --> 09:28.161
but it ain't gonna do
you no good

09:28.428 --> 09:30.029
'cause you got
horseshit equipment.

09:30.230 --> 09:31.963
Is there any point to this
conversation,

09:31.965 --> 09:33.465
or do you just like
to hear yourself talk?

09:33.467 --> 09:34.667
I'm just trying to help.

09:37.837 --> 09:39.073
Come on up and talk to me.

09:39.772 --> 09:42.007
Just man to man.
We'll have a chat. No big deal,

09:42.009 --> 09:43.210
no pressure. No nothing.

09:45.112 --> 09:46.247
No harm in listening.

09:47.381 --> 09:49.816
I'm your friend,
don't forget it.

10:01.395 --> 10:03.996
- Tell me about your hobby.
- Hobby?

10:03.998 --> 10:07.735
- Yeah, racing.
- Hell no.

10:08.836 --> 10:10.070
Racing ain't no hobby.

10:11.505 --> 10:14.273
It's more like
a family tradition.

10:14.275 --> 10:16.942
My... My dad taught me,
and I taught Cam.

10:16.944 --> 10:18.711
- Your dad raced?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

10:18.913 --> 10:22.983
And then my cousins still race,
and my uncles did race.

10:25.019 --> 10:27.853
I... I think my... my mom
would've raced too if,

10:27.855 --> 10:32.192
if my dad had let her.
Some of my best memories are...

10:32.194 --> 10:33.161
are tied up with racing.

10:34.229 --> 10:36.161
When I was 12, my dad
wanted me to ride so bad,

10:36.163 --> 10:39.900
he took a seat and bolted it
into his race car.

10:40.768 --> 10:42.834
And he, uh... he didn't have

10:42.836 --> 10:44.537
a second crash helmet,
so he asked me to use

10:44.539 --> 10:48.374
my football helmet, and, uh,
we went around the track once,

10:48.376 --> 10:51.479
and by the end of that time,
I was sold. This was for me.

10:57.152 --> 10:59.887
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:01.789 --> 11:03.789
I'm gonna eat it.
I'm gonna eat it.

11:03.791 --> 11:05.192
You can have it.

11:22.445 --> 11:26.348
There you are,
I finally got her to calm down.

11:27.114 --> 11:28.216
She's getting so big.

11:31.286 --> 11:32.387
Please say something.

11:33.455 --> 11:35.123
- Like what?
- Anything.

11:35.357 --> 11:36.891
You haven't said a word
since you got home.

11:42.364 --> 11:43.865
I talked to Bob Linsky today.

11:45.568 --> 11:46.835
Why'd you talk to him?

11:47.901 --> 11:49.868
He offered me a job running
his service center.

11:49.870 --> 11:51.839
You know how much
extra money that would pay?

11:52.407 --> 11:53.975
Is that all you guys
talked about?

11:56.244 --> 11:57.512
He's entering a new car
next season.

11:58.513 --> 12:00.015
He wants me to drive it for him.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.150
- You already have a ride.
- I know.

12:04.219 --> 12:06.620
You're not thinking of taking
him up on his offer, are you?

12:06.622 --> 12:08.255
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

12:08.257 --> 12:09.323
Riding for your dad
is one thing,

12:09.325 --> 12:11.591
but riding for that
son of a bitch is dangerous,

12:11.593 --> 12:13.092
in more ways than one.

12:13.094 --> 12:14.861
I hate to think
what your dad would say.

12:14.863 --> 12:17.163
I don't care what he'd say.
This is my life

12:17.165 --> 12:19.365
we're talking about, Cindy,
not my father's.

12:19.367 --> 12:21.402
Great, now you made her cry.

12:21.404 --> 12:24.271
This is what I'm talking about.
We live in this lousy tin can,

12:24.273 --> 12:25.938
and we can't even
have a conversation

12:25.940 --> 12:26.941
without waking the baby.

12:27.977 --> 12:28.742
This tin can happens to be
your family's home.

12:28.744 --> 12:30.311
Look, what you want
me to do?

12:30.313 --> 12:32.048
You want me to be
a loser all my life?

12:34.417 --> 12:36.149
I want to win races.

12:36.151 --> 12:38.084
I want to be a champion,
but that's something

12:38.086 --> 12:40.019
I'll never be racing for my dad.

12:40.021 --> 12:41.322
Have you talked to him
about this?

12:43.326 --> 12:44.391
Look, it's bad enough riding
for someone else,

12:44.393 --> 12:47.294
but riding for Bob Linsky?
You know that won't fly

12:47.296 --> 12:49.897
with your dad.
He'll fire you, son or no son.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.166
- Big frigging deal.
- Cam, it is a big deal.

12:52.168 --> 12:54.203
We got a baby now.
What are we gonna do for money?

12:54.437 --> 12:56.370
I told you that if I drive
for Linsky,

12:56.372 --> 12:58.373
he said he'll give me a job
at his service center.

12:58.375 --> 13:00.041
I can't believe
you trust this guy.

13:48.624 --> 13:50.025
Hey, you.

13:51.994 --> 13:54.296
I wish I could get this
man to pay his bills.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.903
Dad, can I talk to you
for a minute?

14:02.105 --> 14:03.507
Sure. Pull up a chair.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.516
All right. What's on your mind?

14:15.519 --> 14:17.119
I don't want you take this
the wrong way,

14:17.987 --> 14:19.423
but I think it's time
I made a change.

14:22.392 --> 14:23.660
All right. Let's hear it.

14:26.263 --> 14:27.665
I'm not gonna race
for you anymore.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.300
What was that?
What did you just say?

14:32.302 --> 14:34.037
I'm not gonna drive
for you anymore.

14:34.672 --> 14:36.005
I've thought about it
a long time.

14:37.207 --> 14:38.208
There's no other way.

14:39.409 --> 14:42.379
Hell, I thought you liked
racing too much to give it up.

14:47.250 --> 14:48.418
I'm not giving up racing.

14:49.152 --> 14:52.423
Oh, now, son,
how you gonna pull that off?

14:53.156 --> 14:54.723
You know you don't have
the money for that.

14:54.725 --> 14:56.327
I accepted an offer
from Bob Linsky.

15:00.530 --> 15:01.463
- Linsky?
- Take it easy.

15:01.465 --> 15:03.164
- I know you don't like...
- "Don't like him"

15:03.166 --> 15:04.100
is an understatement.

15:05.101 --> 15:05.969
He's a snake. He's a...
He's a piece of shit.

15:06.637 --> 15:08.169
You get involved with
the likes of him,

15:08.171 --> 15:09.805
and I guarantee you'll get hurt.

15:09.807 --> 15:10.708
Please try to understand.

15:11.776 --> 15:12.708
- No, I understand perfectly.
- No! No, you don't.

15:12.710 --> 15:13.843
- Oh, yes, I do!
- With Linsky in my corner,

15:13.845 --> 15:16.178
I'm gonna be an instant
competitor for the championship.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.447
Championship means more
than your father?

15:18.449 --> 15:20.082
It means more than
your loyalties?

15:20.084 --> 15:21.652
It means more to you than
your blood?

15:22.186 --> 15:24.820
Now, I did not bring you up
that way.

15:24.822 --> 15:28.591
Believe me, not racing
for you is the hardest decision

15:28.593 --> 15:30.495
- I've ever had to make.
- Apparently not.

15:33.731 --> 15:35.733
Hold on. Ho... Ho... Hold on.

15:36.167 --> 15:37.201
You're fired.

15:42.674 --> 15:43.775
Fucking Linsky!

15:45.811 --> 15:48.479
Cindy, wait up! Hey!

15:48.746 --> 15:51.415
<i>Wait up! Cindy! Hey!</i>

15:54.085 --> 15:55.353
What did you want me to do?

15:58.256 --> 15:59.724
I know I should've
told you first, okay?

16:56.181 --> 16:58.685
How we doing, Sam?
I'll have a beer.

17:04.288 --> 17:06.290
Just trying to drown
my sorrows, that's all.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.365
You wanna tell me about it?

17:21.239 --> 17:24.141
That bad, huh? I hear ya.

17:36.823 --> 17:37.857
You wanna give me a hint?

17:39.826 --> 17:41.394
I'll take that as a no.

17:42.862 --> 17:46.866
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't you and me go fishing?

17:47.332 --> 17:49.601
Shit, we haven't been
fishing in years.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.270
Come on,
it'll make you feel better.

17:52.537 --> 17:54.237
I'll pick you up early
in the morning.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.908
We'll go down to
our fishing hole.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.711
Come on, it'll just be
like old times.

18:02.749 --> 18:06.219
So, if it ain't the great
Sam "The Man" Munroe.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.889
Fuck you, Jack. I ain't signing
no autographs tonight.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.258
Autograph?

18:13.625 --> 18:16.426
It's been a long time
since you were somebody.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.796
Hey, can't you see
the man wants to be left alone?

18:18.798 --> 18:21.231
What's it been, Sam?
Five, six years

18:21.233 --> 18:22.468
since you ever won a race?

18:23.803 --> 18:25.271
Don't push it, Jack.

18:25.471 --> 18:29.473
- No, no. Let him.
- Hey...

18:29.475 --> 18:31.375
- Let him.
- We always got next year.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.278
Mm-hm.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.181
You may finish in the top ten.
Hell, you may even win a race,

18:37.784 --> 18:39.684
but I doubt it.
What am I thinking?

18:39.686 --> 18:41.788
Not in that shitty equipment
that you got.

18:42.255 --> 18:46.592
But hey, don't take
my word for it. Ask your son.

19:11.952 --> 19:13.721
I told him not to push.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.826
He thinks it's all about
equipment.

19:20.828 --> 19:23.396
I'm gonna prove to him
I'm still the better driver.

19:25.899 --> 19:28.301
- Watch your step.
- He thinks I'm nothing.

19:30.804 --> 19:33.807
I'm a good man.
He'll remember it when I die.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.743
He'll remember
that I'm a good man.

19:36.043 --> 19:37.745
He knows you're
a good man now.

19:38.045 --> 19:40.514
No, he don't.
He... No, he don't.

19:51.859 --> 19:54.260
All right.
End of the line.

19:55.929 --> 19:59.664
Home sweet home. You ready?

20:02.937 --> 20:04.736
You sure cold cocked him.

20:04.738 --> 20:08.042
All right.
Watch your step.

20:11.879 --> 20:15.315
Right here in this rocker here.
Here we go.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.622
You gonna be all right? Okay.

20:24.458 --> 20:25.758
Night, killer.

20:25.760 --> 20:29.964
Oh, God.

20:40.074 --> 20:41.075
Sam?

20:43.978 --> 20:45.013
Sam?

20:47.048 --> 20:50.451
Hey! I gotta be dreaming.

20:52.787 --> 20:54.053
How are you?

20:54.055 --> 20:57.026
- I'm good.
- What time is it?

20:59.526 --> 21:00.962
What happened to your hand?

21:03.064 --> 21:05.800
- Jack Dunn.
- Who is Jack Dunn?

21:06.568 --> 21:08.002
That's a good question.

21:09.904 --> 21:12.505
- You know this looks pretty bad.
- Oh, hell, it's fine.

21:12.507 --> 21:13.741
I just need some aspirin.

21:14.475 --> 21:16.010
I drank too much last night.

21:17.846 --> 21:20.883
Well, I need to get you inside.
I want to put some ice on this.

21:21.817 --> 21:24.052
Well, that's mighty
neighborly of you.

21:25.086 --> 21:27.722
Oh. Come on in.

21:33.695 --> 21:36.596
- Welcome.
- Let me bandage this.

21:36.598 --> 21:38.733
- Got any Band-Aids?
- In the garage.

23:00.549 --> 23:02.484
Please don't do that.

23:04.186 --> 23:06.488
I'm sorry I was just
taking a look.

23:06.755 --> 23:09.192
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
snapped at you.

23:10.926 --> 23:14.798
Don't worry about it.
Is this a '70?

23:15.531 --> 23:17.533
I'm impressed,
How'd you know that?

23:17.734 --> 23:20.670
Growing up, my dad
always had Mustangs.

23:21.204 --> 23:22.138
How long have you had it?

23:26.075 --> 23:29.678
- A long time.
- Does it run?

23:40.724 --> 23:41.858
Been a while.

24:04.681 --> 24:05.815
Oh, boy!

24:39.149 --> 24:40.648
Running like shit.

24:40.650 --> 24:42.683
That would be
that big God damn boat

24:42.685 --> 24:45.555
anchor you got there.
Face it, Sam.

24:45.889 --> 24:47.122
You need a new bullet
under that...

24:47.124 --> 24:48.926
I don't got that kind of money.

24:49.727 --> 24:52.027
Well, you better find it,
because you're gonna

24:52.029 --> 24:53.028
end up looking like a fool.

24:53.030 --> 24:54.663
I'm fine with what I got.

24:54.665 --> 24:56.767
You've been saying
that for the last three years.

24:57.302 --> 25:00.304
Look where it's gotten you.
I'll tell you where. Nowhere.

25:00.904 --> 25:03.172
You're starting
to sound like Cam.

25:03.174 --> 25:05.074
Well, I hate to say it,
but Cam is right.

25:05.076 --> 25:06.774
I don't wanna talk about it.

25:11.782 --> 25:13.184
That's what a motor sounds like.

25:40.878 --> 25:42.147
I'll be damned.

26:17.149 --> 26:18.316
What'd you think of that, kid?

26:21.853 --> 26:23.054
It's a fast son of a bitch,
huh?

26:26.124 --> 26:28.360
- Never been in anything faster.
- You're God damn right.

26:30.463 --> 26:32.896
All you gotta do now is just do
the same thing

26:32.898 --> 26:33.899
when it counts, right?

26:36.066 --> 26:37.933
If anything goes wrong with
that heap of shit,

26:37.935 --> 26:39.502
you let me know,
and I'll fix it right up

26:39.504 --> 26:41.206
- for you, okay?
- All right.

26:43.508 --> 26:44.743
Good job.

26:50.182 --> 26:52.148
<i>Twelve laps of
racing action</i>

26:52.150 --> 26:53.517
<i>in the super late model
division.</i>

26:53.519 --> 26:54.684
<i>There will be three heats</i>

26:54.686 --> 26:57.354
<i>with the top six cars going
to the main event.</i>

26:57.356 --> 26:59.324
<i>The rest of the cars go
to the trailer.</i>

27:10.969 --> 27:14.037
<i>It's time to pound the dirt
in the first heat of the night.</i>

27:14.039 --> 27:17.074
<i>Here we go! We have Cam Munroe</i>

27:17.076 --> 27:19.343
<i>in the lead in a brand
spanking new ride,</i>

27:19.345 --> 27:21.412
<i>now racing for
Bob Linsky's team.</i>

27:21.414 --> 27:23.982
<i>That's right. Like
a true Southern soap opera.</i>

27:29.955 --> 27:32.789
<i>Cam jumped ship
to Linsky's team, and he's got</i>

27:32.791 --> 27:35.858
<i>a shiny new ride that is fast
as thunder and lightning</i>

27:35.860 --> 27:38.764
<i>all tied up in a bow.
His dad's not happy.</i>

27:41.434 --> 27:44.502
<i>Here comes the checkered flag
for Cam Munroe</i>

27:44.504 --> 27:47.272
<i>as he takes heat number one
in super late model.</i>

27:50.343 --> 27:52.478
That kid is gonna be
a winner one day.

27:52.877 --> 27:55.348
That's if his father is
not in the race.

27:56.249 --> 27:58.582
- I'm telling you.
- You're very sentimental.

27:58.584 --> 28:01.354
Yes, I am, but I can
judge character.

28:01.887 --> 28:03.022
This is mine now.

28:04.357 --> 28:05.657
<i>We're nearing
the end of heat number two,</i>

28:05.659 --> 28:09.494
<i>and this one has been all Bob
"Lead Foot" Linsky tonight.</i>

28:09.496 --> 28:11.562
<i>He's picking up
right where he left off</i>

28:11.564 --> 28:14.799
<i>last season with
that bad ass number 33 car.</i>

28:15.067 --> 28:17.503
<i>Hell, it even seems faster,
if that's possible.</i>

28:28.548 --> 28:30.482
<i>Tonight,
we are seeing the return of</i>

28:30.484 --> 28:33.387
<i>one of the greatest drivers
to ever grace the dirt oval.</i>

28:33.587 --> 28:35.386
<i>Sam "The Man" Munroe.</i>

28:35.388 --> 28:37.621
<i>Certainly no
driver has won more races here,</i>

28:37.623 --> 28:40.525
<i>but Sam hasn't driven on
a track in six years,</i>

28:40.527 --> 28:43.127
<i>so he's gotta be rusty.
And now he's mixed up</i>

28:43.129 --> 28:46.631
<i>in the crazy soap opera that
has his son, Cam, racing for</i>

28:46.633 --> 28:50.135
<i>his old arch rival Bob Linsky.
Hell, you can't write</i>

28:50.137 --> 28:51.305
<i>this any better.</i>

28:52.539 --> 28:53.772
<i>Heat number three
is winding down,</i>

28:53.774 --> 28:57.342
<i>and Sam Munroe seems
to have shaken off the cobwebs</i>

28:57.344 --> 28:59.579
<i>and is leading.
Can he hold on?</i>

29:11.491 --> 29:15.160
<i>And Sam Munroe takes victory
here in heat number three,</i>

29:15.162 --> 29:18.363
<i>putting on a clinic
in old-school, hard-nosed,</i>

29:18.365 --> 29:20.033
<i>dirt track racing.</i>

29:25.004 --> 29:27.639
<i>It's going to be an interesting
main event tonight, folks.</i>

29:27.641 --> 29:30.008
<i>Sam Munroe and his son,
Cam Munroe,</i>

29:30.010 --> 29:31.943
will be going toe to toe

29:31.945 --> 29:33.445
<i>right up in
the front of the pack</i>

29:33.447 --> 29:36.448
<i>with the bad boy of
dirt track himself, Bob Linsky.</i>

29:36.450 --> 29:38.517
<i>Should be
extremely entertaining</i>

29:38.519 --> 29:40.686
<i>as there was never
any love lost between</i>

29:40.688 --> 29:42.523
<i>Sam Munroe and Bob Linsky.</i>

29:43.558 --> 29:45.326
<i>18 cars on the track.</i>

29:45.593 --> 29:47.394
<i>Here we go!</i>

29:49.029 --> 29:51.096
<i>The green flag drops,
and the family reunion</i>

29:51.098 --> 29:54.034
<i>is in full force tonight
in Talladega, Alabama.</i>

29:55.202 --> 29:57.536
<i>Power racing right
from the start here tonight,</i>

29:57.538 --> 30:00.673
<i>with Linsky and Cam Munroe
already starting to walk away</i>

30:00.675 --> 30:03.074
<i>from the field.
Sam Munroe included.</i>

30:03.076 --> 30:05.344
<i>I just don't know
if Sam has the machine to hang</i>

30:05.346 --> 30:06.981
<i>with Linsky's new car.</i>

30:08.683 --> 30:09.915
<i>There they are,
side by side.</i>

30:09.917 --> 30:13.251
<i>It's Linsky and Cam Munroe
looking like figure skaters</i>

30:13.253 --> 30:15.222
<i>putting on a
show for the crowd.</i>

30:18.593 --> 30:20.528
<i>And Linsky
pulls out in front now.</i>

30:22.530 --> 30:24.964
<i>Here comes
Sam Munroe barreling around</i>

30:24.966 --> 30:27.235
<i>the outside going for
a gutsy pass on his son.</i>

30:28.369 --> 30:30.636
<i>Sam Munroe and Linsky,
two of the best ever,</i>

30:30.638 --> 30:32.606
<i>tangled going into turn one.</i>

30:32.608 --> 30:34.075
<i>This crowd loves it.</i>

30:37.978 --> 30:39.645
<i>It's Cam Munroe, Linsky,</i>

30:39.647 --> 30:42.583
<i>and Sam Munroe battling back
and forth now.</i>

30:46.654 --> 30:48.687
<i>And there goes
Sam Munroe around Linsky.</i>

30:48.689 --> 30:52.324
- <i>Wow, how does he do that?</i>
- <i>Bob Linsky</i>

30:52.326 --> 30:54.561
<i>immediately gives him
a hard bump and says,</i>

30:54.563 --> 30:56.763
<i>"Welcome back t
o the dirt, Sam."</i>

30:56.765 --> 30:59.063
<i>Sam Munroe slams
right back into Linsky,</i>

30:59.065 --> 31:01.068
<i>closing the door
on his attempted pass. Wow!</i>

31:03.438 --> 31:06.405
<i>These two old veterans
are trading paint now</i>

31:06.407 --> 31:08.109
<i>like it's a demolition derby.</i>

31:08.476 --> 31:11.547
<i>Wow, that was
a pure power move right there.</i>

31:12.013 --> 31:13.680
<i>The gloves are off,
and we are in</i>

31:13.682 --> 31:16.182
<i>an old-fashioned
street fight now.</i>

31:16.184 --> 31:18.285
<i>Cam Munroe
around Linsky. Wow.</i>

31:18.287 --> 31:20.522
<i>The white flag
is out. One lap to go.</i>

31:21.223 --> 31:23.589
<i>Wait a second,
Cam Munroe slides in next</i>

31:23.591 --> 31:25.560
<i>to his dad trying
to pass for the win.</i>

31:27.028 --> 31:29.729
<i>Sam Munroe holds
on and takes the victory</i>

31:29.731 --> 31:32.331
- <i>in an incredible race!</i>
- <i>Whoo!</i>

31:32.333 --> 31:35.302
<i>Sam's first race
back in six years,</i>

31:35.304 --> 31:37.804
<i>and he looks like
he hasn't lost a step.</i>

31:40.309 --> 31:41.441
<i>And here he is,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

31:41.443 --> 31:45.612
<i>your winner tonight,
Sam "The Man" Munroe!</i>

31:45.614 --> 31:47.546
<i>Give him a round of applause,
everyone!</i>

31:47.548 --> 31:48.449
Yeah!

31:49.718 --> 31:50.817
<i>That was one hell
of a race, folks!</i>

31:50.819 --> 31:53.455
Give it up for Sam Munroe!

32:05.702 --> 32:09.069
I wish I could've seen
lead ass's face

32:09.071 --> 32:10.238
when you spun him out.

32:11.239 --> 32:12.539
I don't want to talk about it.

32:12.541 --> 32:15.310
Oh. Well, who put the buzz
kill bee in your bonnet?

32:15.844 --> 32:17.479
Geez, you ought to
be proud of yourself.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.082
That's some of the best racing
you've done in years.

32:21.818 --> 32:23.185
Hey, Dad?

32:26.523 --> 32:28.223
I just want to say, good race.

32:30.192 --> 32:31.728
Did you get your tools
from the garage?

32:33.630 --> 32:34.528
What?

32:34.530 --> 32:36.765
Did you get your tools
from the garage?

32:39.635 --> 32:41.503
I'll come by tomorrow
after work.

32:43.272 --> 32:44.707
Be sure you do that.

33:09.164 --> 33:11.668
Hey. How are you?

33:12.769 --> 33:13.803
Good.

33:23.846 --> 33:25.615
Sam, you okay?

33:27.350 --> 33:28.685
Cam, he's in there.

33:30.887 --> 33:32.655
I just don't know
what to do about him.

33:35.325 --> 33:39.160
Don't worry. You just gotta
give it some time.

33:39.162 --> 33:40.530
Yeah. Yeah.

33:43.299 --> 33:44.535
You guys will figure it out.

33:46.669 --> 33:47.604
Yeah.

33:49.706 --> 33:51.240
Would it help
if I talked to him?

33:51.841 --> 33:53.509
Hell, I don't know.

33:56.379 --> 33:57.614
You all right with that?

33:57.815 --> 34:02.553
- Of course.
- Well, if you are, I guess.

34:03.186 --> 34:05.254
- I'll give it a try.
- All right.

34:05.856 --> 34:11.159
- I'll see you later.
- Oh, my God. You.

34:21.739 --> 34:22.739
Hey.

34:25.643 --> 34:27.344
Cam, why are you doing this?

34:27.543 --> 34:31.181
- Doing what?
- Driving for Linsky?

34:32.315 --> 34:34.482
You know, it's breaking
your father's heart.

34:34.484 --> 34:35.385
Is it?

34:37.487 --> 34:38.521
You know it is.

34:40.223 --> 34:42.393
Well, hearts get broken
now and then.

34:54.371 --> 34:56.572
That's why I've been after Dad
to sell this monster.

34:56.908 --> 35:00.243
It's just been sitting here
untouched for years.

35:00.978 --> 35:02.546
It's not doing anybody
any good...

35:04.915 --> 35:06.316
but you know how stubborn he is.

35:07.851 --> 35:09.453
Like father, like son?

35:13.524 --> 35:16.258
Dad bought the car for Mom
as a gift after he won

35:16.260 --> 35:17.394
his fifth championship.

35:19.296 --> 35:20.897
About a half hour after
they left,

35:20.899 --> 35:24.902
it started raining pretty hard,
and something happened.

35:27.038 --> 35:28.439
Dad lost control...

35:31.810 --> 35:32.911
and I lost my mom.

35:33.678 --> 35:36.280
Oh... Cam.

35:40.685 --> 35:41.953
And you keep racing.

35:42.854 --> 35:44.422
It's what Mom would've wanted.

35:46.323 --> 35:47.658
Racing's in our blood.

35:49.326 --> 35:51.060
Welcome back to <i>Trading Paint.</i>

35:51.062 --> 35:53.698
I'm your host,
Sheriff Buck Taylor.

35:54.065 --> 35:56.466
<i>Well, folks, we have
a very special guest</i>

35:56.468 --> 35:57.902
<i>in the studio today.</i>

35:58.336 --> 36:02.638
A man who stands third
in points with five races

36:02.640 --> 36:06.979
<i>yet to go. Our local legend,
Sam "The Man" Munroe.</i>

36:07.579 --> 36:10.847
Well, Sam, uh...
I want to be the first

36:10.849 --> 36:12.715
to welcome you back.
You haven't been on

36:12.717 --> 36:14.650
- the show in a while, have you?
- No, I haven't,

36:14.652 --> 36:15.653
and I appreciate it.

36:16.588 --> 36:17.854
- Thanks for having me back.
- All right.

36:17.856 --> 36:19.322
Well, I've got to ask you

36:19.324 --> 36:20.890
a question that's on
the minds of all

36:20.892 --> 36:23.459
- the racing fans out there.
- Well, all right.

36:23.461 --> 36:26.598
What is going on with you
and your son, Cam?

36:27.532 --> 36:29.733
Well, nothing really.
I mean, we just happen

36:29.735 --> 36:31.869
to be in the same race series,
that's all.

36:31.871 --> 36:33.870
Yes, but it is unusual.

36:33.872 --> 36:37.342
No. No. Fathers
and sons always, uh...

36:37.742 --> 36:40.612
race against each other.
It's not unusual at all.

36:40.979 --> 36:45.050
True. But he is driving for
your main rival.

36:45.885 --> 36:48.486
Now, look. My son
is a hell of a driver.

36:49.121 --> 36:51.590
<i>He ought to be, because I
taught him everything he knows.</i>

36:52.057 --> 36:55.025
<i>But he wants to win,
like all of the drivers do</i>

36:55.027 --> 36:57.062
<i>on the racetrack,
including myself.</i>

36:57.929 --> 37:01.733
<i>So, I guess he decided
to drive for someone else.</i>

37:02.034 --> 37:03.936
He thought he might have
a better chance of winning.

37:04.502 --> 37:07.807
Got you.
Oh, we got a call coming in.

37:08.040 --> 37:12.142
- Hello, you're on the air.
- <i>Sam, I just wanna say</i>

37:12.144 --> 37:15.612
<i>I'm a big fan of yours
and you'll always be the champ.</i>

37:15.614 --> 37:16.947
Well, I appreciate it.
Thank you.

37:16.949 --> 37:18.782
<i>Will you do me a favor,
please?</i>

37:18.784 --> 37:19.984
Anything for a fan.

37:19.986 --> 37:22.685
<i>Would you blow
that loser, Bob Linsky,</i>

37:22.687 --> 37:23.954
<i>right off the track?</i>

37:26.125 --> 37:27.927
<i>Oh,
she's feisty, ain't she?</i>

37:28.393 --> 37:30.928
<i>Well, why...
why don't you consider it done.</i>

37:30.930 --> 37:33.697
<i>Now, I don't normally
speak ill of the drivers.</i>

37:33.699 --> 37:37.469
<i>You guys have a dangerous job.
But that Lead Foot Linsky,</i>

37:37.770 --> 37:41.973
<i>that's a total loser.
The slimiest, back stabbing,</i>

37:41.975 --> 37:44.878
<i>son of a skunk who ever
stole a car race.</i>

37:46.045 --> 37:47.012
<i>Well...</i>

37:48.280 --> 37:50.814
<i>I think you took the words
right out of my mouth, ma'am.</i>

37:50.816 --> 37:52.950
<i>Uh... That gives
you a free pass</i>

37:52.952 --> 37:54.086
for speeding tickets.

37:59.491 --> 38:00.994
<i>Oh, she's a pistol.</i>

38:01.194 --> 38:03.662
<i>She's a pistol.</i>

38:03.964 --> 38:06.633
<i>Well, listen, folks,
you heard it first right here.</i>

38:06.833 --> 38:08.835
<i>He's gonna blow him off
the track.</i>

38:09.102 --> 38:10.769
<i>Well, Buck, appreciate it.</i>

38:24.851 --> 38:26.885
<i>Good evening,
and welcome to one</i>

38:26.887 --> 38:29.756
<i>of the biggest races
of the year, the Ford 50.</i>

38:30.023 --> 38:32.123
<i>This super late model race
is one of the tightest</i>

38:32.125 --> 38:34.892
<i>we've ever had with
three racers vying for</i>

38:34.894 --> 38:37.763
<i>the top spot in
this series championship.</i>

38:41.533 --> 38:42.601
Hey, buddy.

38:49.009 --> 38:50.477
You know what?

38:52.746 --> 38:54.514
Your father is getting...

38:55.649 --> 38:57.984
a little bit too far
ahead of me in the points thing.

39:00.220 --> 39:04.591
And, uh... it's just
fucking points, you know, but...

39:05.625 --> 39:09.496
um, in the end it means a lot,
so...

39:10.764 --> 39:12.766
what the hell am I gonna
do about that?

39:16.203 --> 39:18.636
You asking me to intentionally
wreck my dad?

39:18.638 --> 39:19.572
I'm not asking.

39:25.912 --> 39:27.647
You wanna win? Let's win.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.321
<i>The super late
model action is nonstop tonight</i>

40:08.323 --> 40:10.222
<i>with three laps to go in
the main event.</i>

40:10.224 --> 40:13.658
<i>Its' been a family affair
featuring a rough and tumble,</i>

40:13.660 --> 40:17.564
<i>back-and-forth battle between
Sam Munroe and his son Cam.</i>

40:21.268 --> 40:24.103
<i>Sam leads with Cam
knocking on his back door</i>

40:24.105 --> 40:26.105
<i>as they start
to hit lapped traffic.</i>

40:26.107 --> 40:28.241
<i>Cam looking for
an opening to pass,</i>

40:28.243 --> 40:30.278
<i>and his dad just
keeps slamming the door.</i>

40:32.247 --> 40:34.179
<i>And there goes
Cam Munroe on the inside.</i>

40:34.181 --> 40:36.982
- <i>He's really punching it hard.</i>
- <i>Father and son,</i>

40:36.984 --> 40:37.985
<i>side by side.</i>

40:39.253 --> 40:43.122
<i>Neither man is willing to give.
Both pulling out all the stops.</i>

40:43.124 --> 40:44.723
<i>This is what
southern racing is</i>

40:44.725 --> 40:46.261
<i>all about right here.</i>

40:47.062 --> 40:48.995
<i>There's not
an ounce of quit in either</i>

40:48.997 --> 40:51.197
<i>of these Munroe boys,
but something's gotta give here</i>

40:51.199 --> 40:53.366
<i>with one lap to go!</i>

40:53.368 --> 40:55.969
<i>They are grinding
hard down the back stretch,</i>

40:55.971 --> 40:57.272
<i>still neck and neck.</i>

41:08.783 --> 41:11.053
<i>And it looks like
Cam is backing off now.</i>

41:15.190 --> 41:17.824
<i>Sam Munroe charges
hard down the front stretch</i>

41:17.826 --> 41:21.927
<i>and takes the checkered flag!
Wow. That win puts him way out</i>

41:21.929 --> 41:22.995
<i>in front of the points
championship,</i>

41:22.997 --> 41:26.068
<i>with a comfortable lead over
Bob Linsky.</i>

41:40.882 --> 41:42.918
I guess this is the point
where you tell me I'm fired.

41:44.653 --> 41:45.921
That would make sense.

41:48.890 --> 41:51.091
Actually, no. I kind of knew

41:51.093 --> 41:53.361
you'd never intentionally hurt
your father.

41:56.064 --> 42:00.035
It was a bad call. I apologize.

42:02.438 --> 42:05.241
Let's load up the trucks
and get the hell out of here.

42:06.142 --> 42:10.912
We've got a big day
at work tomorrow. I'm sorry.

42:15.884 --> 42:19.288
You know what? I'm getting,
I'm tired of both of them.

42:20.088 --> 42:23.092
- Father and son.
- Hell, I'm your guy.

42:24.726 --> 42:27.063
Just give me the opportunity,
buddy, I'll take their ass out.

42:27.830 --> 42:29.265
- Consider it done.
- I live for it.

42:32.068 --> 42:34.100
I just wanna say
I appreciate all of y'all

42:34.102 --> 42:36.270
coming out tonight,
because this community

42:36.272 --> 42:39.939
means a lot of me.
Now, I know some of y'all

42:39.941 --> 42:43.210
are concerned about me retiring,
but I've been racing

42:43.212 --> 42:45.181
for 70 years,
and I've worked hard at it,

42:45.481 --> 42:47.982
and I'll be 85 in
a month from now,

42:47.984 --> 42:51.252
so I think I deserve a little
retirement to spend more time

42:51.254 --> 42:53.723
hunting and fishing,
and that's what I plan on doing.

42:56.959 --> 42:58.858
You know, you look like
a little tensed tonight

42:58.860 --> 43:01.030
so I think I'll tell you
an old folk's joke,

43:01.397 --> 43:02.797
since I'm an old folks.

43:03.065 --> 43:05.366
You know, this old man
was sitting on the curb,

43:05.368 --> 43:06.869
and he was crying...

43:11.941 --> 43:13.876
I think you've had enough
to drink tonight.

43:14.444 --> 43:16.146
Why don't you let Cindy take
you home?

43:16.812 --> 43:18.714
Why don't you mind
your own business?

43:19.016 --> 43:21.149
Now, come on. Let me
take you out to the truck,

43:21.151 --> 43:22.983
and I'll tell Cindy
you're waiting for her.

43:22.985 --> 43:24.253
I don't need your help.

43:25.021 --> 43:26.987
Now, come on.
Everybody needs help.

43:26.989 --> 43:29.358
That's why you have family.
That's why you have friends.

43:30.026 --> 43:32.159
Why don't you cut the crap,
and let's just get out of here.

43:32.161 --> 43:33.428
- Come on.
- What do you know

43:33.430 --> 43:36.065
about family, Pop? I mean,

43:36.266 --> 43:39.201
seriously, and I'm not talking
about no Sunday dinners

43:39.203 --> 43:41.236
and birthday parties
with Grandma.

43:41.238 --> 43:43.774
Do you have any idea
what it's like to be me?

43:44.908 --> 43:47.074
My job is hanging by a thread,

43:47.076 --> 43:49.310
and I got a son of a bitch boss
I can't even trust.

43:49.312 --> 43:50.813
That didn't have to be.

43:53.049 --> 43:57.387
Well, anyways, you're
a winner now, finally again.

43:58.522 --> 44:01.089
That's exactly what you wanted.
It's the way it should be.

44:01.091 --> 44:02.459
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

44:03.527 --> 44:05.028
What are you talking about?

44:08.232 --> 44:10.532
Dad, every day I look into
Cindy's eyes,

44:10.534 --> 44:11.801
and I see it right there.

44:12.868 --> 44:16.504
She's losing faith in me,
a little more every day.

44:16.506 --> 44:17.840
That is bullshit.

44:21.111 --> 44:23.213
How on earth
would you know that?

44:23.981 --> 44:26.482
We never talked
about nothing important.

44:26.484 --> 44:30.586
- Cam, that ain't true.
- "Racing is everything.

44:30.588 --> 44:32.089
It solves all your problems."

44:33.023 --> 44:34.589
I've been listening to
that stupid shit

44:34.591 --> 44:35.924
since I was a kid.

44:35.926 --> 44:37.192
Now, Cam, I never heard
this before.

44:37.194 --> 44:38.827
You never complained
about this before.

44:38.829 --> 44:40.528
Like I had a choice.

44:40.530 --> 44:41.932
You... Well,
you do have a choice.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.267
It's your life now. No one can
tell you how to run your life.

44:45.269 --> 44:47.836
Damn right! Not you, not Cindy,

44:47.838 --> 44:49.137
not my God damn boss.

44:49.139 --> 44:50.606
Calm down. You're working
yourself up

44:50.608 --> 44:53.609
over nothing. Okay?
Now, I've thought...

44:53.611 --> 44:55.513
You thought you raised me
better, right?

44:56.247 --> 44:58.015
Ain't that what you always
saying?

44:59.383 --> 45:02.553
Look, just let me do it my way.

45:05.222 --> 45:08.259
Stay out of my life.
You got it?

45:12.397 --> 45:13.998
Right between the eyes.

45:15.266 --> 45:16.301
Good.

45:23.373 --> 45:28.277
<i>♪ Heaven came down

45:28.279 --> 45:29.946

- What?

45:30.315 --> 45:32.048
I just had a fight
with my father.

45:32.050 --> 45:34.950
- Oh, my God. What now?
- Yes, fucking now.

45:34.952 --> 45:37.053
- We gotta go home.
- Honey, you just, what is...

45:37.055 --> 45:38.154
I'm not talking about it.

45:38.156 --> 45:39.955
You just had a fight
with him now?

45:39.957 --> 45:41.560
Oh, my God, when are you
gonna grow up?

45:42.193 --> 45:44.026
Is this seriously
gonna continue?

45:44.028 --> 45:44.929
Just leave.

One, two, three, up.

48:37.337 --> 48:38.605
How's my son?

48:40.139 --> 48:42.340
Your son
suffered different fractures

48:42.342 --> 48:44.475
to both of his legs.

48:44.477 --> 48:46.079
Will it affect his walking?

48:46.379 --> 48:48.281
With time he should make
a full recovery.

48:48.515 --> 48:52.085
- When can we see him?
- Not right now.

48:53.487 --> 48:55.723
All right. Well, you...
you tell us when we can.

48:56.257 --> 48:57.624
Of course.

49:00.293 --> 49:04.564
Thank you.
That's good news, really.

49:05.231 --> 49:08.468
Fractures, and he's tough.
He'll get through that.

49:42.169 --> 49:43.203
Sam.

51:15.765 --> 51:18.433
- Thanks for watching Abby.
- That's no problem.

51:19.769 --> 51:21.235
Are you gonna go see him again?

51:22.437 --> 51:26.773
- He really wants to see you.
- I'm not so sure about that.

51:26.775 --> 51:27.942
Why would you say that?

51:28.643 --> 51:31.513
I don't know.
Just all we've been through,

51:31.880 --> 51:33.646
and I think we might
just be better...

51:33.648 --> 51:35.751
If what? You don't go
see your son?

51:36.719 --> 51:38.384
He still loves you,
you know?

51:38.386 --> 51:42.257
- He looks up to you.
- Really?

51:42.792 --> 51:43.959
Yeah.

51:46.695 --> 51:50.265
You know something?
We're lucky to have you.

51:50.565 --> 51:53.803
I think you're the only one
keeping this family together.

51:55.503 --> 51:56.672
Promise me you'll go see him.

51:58.273 --> 51:59.274
I promise.

52:09.952 --> 52:11.686
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

52:13.288 --> 52:15.858
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

52:17.593 --> 52:19.929
- Got some magazines.
- Thanks.

52:20.563 --> 52:22.765
- You can put them on the table.
- All right.

52:24.467 --> 52:25.501
How you feeling?

52:26.736 --> 52:28.802
I am not feeling much
of anything.

52:28.804 --> 52:29.739
Mm-hm.

52:30.573 --> 52:31.707
They got me on
this morphine drip,

52:32.608 --> 52:34.942
and not being able to move
is driving me fricking crazy.

52:34.944 --> 52:35.845
I know.

52:37.680 --> 52:39.348
But we gotta get you well.

52:40.583 --> 52:42.785
And I know you,
you're just like me.

52:42.985 --> 52:45.588
You feeling a little better,
you'll overdo it. So...

52:45.989 --> 52:47.991
don't do nothing stupid.

52:51.560 --> 52:53.362
- How are you?
- All right.

52:56.767 --> 52:57.867
Listen, um...

52:59.869 --> 53:00.936
the other night at dinner...

53:02.605 --> 53:04.975
you said a few things
that got me thinking, and, uh...

53:09.746 --> 53:12.649
I just want to say I'm sorry
if I fucked up as a dad.

53:13.650 --> 53:14.985
I meant well.

53:15.886 --> 53:17.320
You don't need to apologize.

53:19.890 --> 53:22.992
It wasn't easy on either of us,
losing Mom.

53:23.626 --> 53:25.996
But I still should've been
there more for you...

53:27.898 --> 53:29.900
and I promise I will be
from now on.

53:33.737 --> 53:36.673
- Don't you hate me?
- Oh, son.

53:37.507 --> 53:41.478
- I could never hate you.
- But I left you for Linsky.

53:41.745 --> 53:44.648
I don't care
how many times you leave me,

53:44.847 --> 53:48.718
- I will always be there.
- I gotta tell you something.

53:53.523 --> 53:55.392
After he didn't get into
the main event,

53:56.960 --> 53:59.527
Linsky was scared of you
gaining points on him.

53:59.529 --> 54:00.530
Mm-hm.

54:01.698 --> 54:04.401
He wanted me to crash you
out of the race.

54:08.438 --> 54:10.006
That son of a bitch.

54:12.475 --> 54:13.643
Why didn't you tell me?

54:15.779 --> 54:18.548
I also didn't want to admit
I was wrong and you were right.

54:24.588 --> 54:25.823
I'm sorry I fucked up.

54:27.091 --> 54:30.895
Let me tell you something.
You are a good man.

54:31.562 --> 54:34.998
You're a good father,
and you're a good husband,

54:35.699 --> 54:37.067
and that's all that matters.

54:40.204 --> 54:42.106
I want you to come back to me.

54:44.008 --> 54:47.510
We'll do it right this time.
No half-ass measures.

54:48.445 --> 54:50.147
I want you in the racing seat.

54:50.915 --> 54:53.182
Who would be better
to continue the Munroe

54:53.184 --> 54:54.685
racing legend than you?

54:56.487 --> 54:59.723
- Are you serious?
- Damn straight.

55:00.457 --> 55:01.758
Hundred percent.

55:06.496 --> 55:09.600
Yeah. Yeah. I guess we
can salvage some of it.

55:09.834 --> 55:11.767
The block is cracked.

55:11.769 --> 55:12.937
Mm-hm.

55:14.105 --> 55:16.805
Dirty damn shame
though, you coming so close.

55:16.807 --> 55:17.909
Yeah.

55:20.145 --> 55:22.813
I guess, that don't matter
much now anyway, does it?

55:23.214 --> 55:24.582
Nope.

55:27.018 --> 55:29.251
Remember a few weeks
back you spoke

55:29.253 --> 55:31.854
about your brother said
something about some guy

55:31.856 --> 55:33.057
that was building
a new late model?

55:33.958 --> 55:34.959
Yeah.

55:36.094 --> 55:37.662
Do you think that guy would be
interested in selling?

55:37.963 --> 55:39.430
I don't know.

55:40.966 --> 55:42.768
But if he was willing
to sell it,

55:43.101 --> 55:44.636
it would cost you
a pretty penny.

55:47.038 --> 55:49.140
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

55:49.974 --> 55:53.744
My brother, he said, uh, the guy
always bought the best, so well,

55:55.713 --> 55:57.481
do you have a pretty penny?

55:57.950 --> 55:59.051
Mm.

56:57.943 --> 57:00.710
Sam, you can't...
I'm sorry, sir.

57:00.712 --> 57:03.646
- I couldn't stop him.
- That's okay, honey.

57:03.648 --> 57:05.582
I... I got it.
Would you close the door?

57:05.584 --> 57:06.585
Yeah.

57:07.353 --> 57:08.718
So what do I owe
this pleasure?

57:08.720 --> 57:11.122
Is the offer for
the Mustang Boss

57:11.124 --> 57:12.591
still on the table?

57:13.893 --> 57:18.863
I remember a guy who said
that he was never ever

57:18.865 --> 57:20.131
gonna sell that car,
no matter what.

57:20.133 --> 57:23.235
It had some kind of
sentimental value or...

57:23.769 --> 57:27.039
some God damn thing.
So, why now?

57:28.840 --> 57:32.979
- I'm retiring from racing.
- All right.

57:36.015 --> 57:36.916
That's it?

57:37.850 --> 57:38.849
Yeah, that's it.
What do you want me to do?

57:38.851 --> 57:40.851
- Jump up and down.
- I thought you'd be happy

57:40.853 --> 57:41.821
I'd be out of your way.

57:42.922 --> 57:43.988
Now there's no one that can
stop you from winning

57:43.990 --> 57:45.590
- that sixth championship.
- Oh, I'm happy as hell.

57:46.691 --> 57:48.860
Sam "The Man" Munroe is gonna
retire from racing.

57:49.095 --> 57:53.665
Sure, that makes me very happy.
Sounds good. Don't feel great.

57:54.300 --> 57:56.169
In fact,
I'm kinda disappointed.

57:56.702 --> 57:59.105
- I don't understand.
- Oh, yes you do, man.

58:00.106 --> 58:03.643
I want to win that championship,
and I want to win it from you.

58:04.644 --> 58:07.745
I want to win it fair
and square, right in front

58:07.747 --> 58:09.914
of all your adoring fans,
okay?

58:09.916 --> 58:12.983
What's it gonna look like
if I win the race

58:12.985 --> 58:13.986
and you ain't even in it?

58:14.987 --> 58:17.888
That's not my concern.
My concern is my family.

58:17.890 --> 58:20.294
I feel awful, sorry for Cam
and I'm...

58:21.428 --> 58:23.263
really sad for what happened,
but that's racing.

58:24.164 --> 58:26.934
You wouldn't understand.
Trust me.

58:27.901 --> 58:29.303
You don't give me much credit,
do you?

58:30.904 --> 58:33.704
You know, maybe you oughta
try me,

58:33.706 --> 58:36.240
because maybe I might have
a little bit more brains

58:36.242 --> 58:37.610
than you give me credit for.

58:38.945 --> 58:41.881
A car and racing...

58:42.382 --> 58:43.350
doesn't mean nothing,

58:44.351 --> 58:47.354
when you got a child lying
in a hospital bed.

58:50.057 --> 58:51.992
That's very touching.

58:55.829 --> 58:56.662
You don't believe me.

58:59.932 --> 59:02.102
As a matter of fact,
I do believe you.

59:02.402 --> 59:04.004
You want to buy it
or you don't?

59:06.406 --> 59:08.108
I'll send somebody
over to pick it up.

59:08.375 --> 59:10.244
But don't bother.
I'll drive it myself.

59:19.220 --> 59:22.087
Okay, everyone.
Open your history book

59:22.089 --> 59:23.821
to chapter five.

59:29.129 --> 59:31.398
- James, sit down.
- You gotta come check this out!

59:32.399 --> 59:35.736
- Class! Jacob! Madeline!
- Oh, my God.

59:38.339 --> 59:39.407
Whoa.

59:54.254 --> 59:56.757
Look at all the smoke.

01:00:35.929 --> 01:00:37.065
Might want to get
her washed.

01:01:00.321 --> 01:01:01.256
Hey, you.

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:03.956
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm going out of town,

01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:05.293
and I'll be back tomorrow late.

01:01:05.927 --> 01:01:07.362
I'm going to look at a race car.

01:01:09.197 --> 01:01:10.832
Because I have something
to tell you,

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.269
and I wanted to tell you
in person.

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:18.907
I think I'm in love with you.

01:01:31.019 --> 01:01:33.289
I don't know what to say.

01:01:33.555 --> 01:01:37.557
Don't say anything.
I'll see you tomorrow,

01:01:37.559 --> 01:01:38.927
then we'll talk about it.

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:43.132
Drive safe.

01:02:11.025 --> 01:02:11.857
How y'all doing?

01:02:11.859 --> 01:02:13.028
- Good.
- How are you?

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:15.362
Good. I know you
got here as quick as you could,

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:17.030
but I got something in there
that'd get you here quicker.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.568
You must be Stumpy.

01:02:20.302 --> 01:02:22.537
What gave me away?
You must be Ben.

01:02:22.539 --> 01:02:24.672
Yes, sir.
And that means you're Sam?

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.541
- Sam.
- Pleasure meeting you, Sam.

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:29.412
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes, sir. Well, boys...

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:31.546
- let's take a look.
- All right.

01:02:31.548 --> 01:02:32.448
Come on.

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:35.918
So what do we got?

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.191
Got a Rocket chassis,
Clements race engine,

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:46.496
Bert Transmission.
It's got a Franklin rear end.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:51.466
It's got a C&R radiator.
It's got Afco shocks.

01:02:51.468 --> 01:02:54.202
It's got Dave Smith
750 carburetor,

01:02:54.204 --> 01:02:57.272
the best one you can buy.
You've got a sweet...

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.376
steering rack,
ButlerBuilt seats,

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:04.280
Performance Friction brakes,
Schoenfeld headers.

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:05.979
I got it all.

01:03:05.981 --> 01:03:07.517
You got a big bunch
of boxes.

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:10.585
- How much is here?
- I got everything it takes

01:03:10.587 --> 01:03:12.355
for y'all to complete this car.

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:14.991
Well, would you take 80 cash?

01:03:15.492 --> 01:03:16.991
Damn, man. That's...
That's hurting me

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:19.229
a little bit. Uh...

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:23.698
I gotta have what I put into it.

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.967
Mm-hm.

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:29.239
And, uh, I need at least 85.

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:31.941
I ain't got 85.

01:03:37.515 --> 01:03:39.015
You like bikes?

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:41.151
Yes, sir. I dabble.

01:03:42.753 --> 01:03:44.387
Well, how about this?

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:46.656
Eighty cash and a trade.

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:49.159
Well, that depends.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.492
What's the trade?

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.695
Fully restored '51
Panhead motor.

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:56.132
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:58.536
- I can't let you do that.
- I already done it.

01:03:59.737 --> 01:04:00.937
We got a deal?

01:04:01.372 --> 01:04:05.509
- '51 Panhead motor?
- Yep.

01:04:08.012 --> 01:04:09.546
- Fully rebuilt?
- Yeah.

01:04:09.746 --> 01:04:12.148
I'll bet my leg on it.

01:04:17.488 --> 01:04:20.224
That's a deal.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:23.260
Sam, it's a good deal.
It's a good deal, Sam.

01:04:25.062 --> 01:04:26.464
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you, Sam.

01:04:27.064 --> 01:04:28.730
- Good day.
- So long, Ben.

01:04:28.732 --> 01:04:32.102
All right, Stumpy.
Let's win some races!

01:04:35.573 --> 01:04:39.209
Stumpy, you are out
of your mind.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:42.079
It's good to pay
a long overdue debt.

01:04:42.746 --> 01:04:44.281
You don't owe me nothing.

01:04:44.815 --> 01:04:47.416
Hey, I wonder what
Linsky will be thinking

01:04:47.418 --> 01:04:49.451
when he sees us pulling up to
the track next season

01:04:49.453 --> 01:04:51.053
with this badass mother.

01:04:51.055 --> 01:04:51.957
God damn!

01:05:02.333 --> 01:05:04.301
Little more Sam, that's it.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:08.138
Oh, hey, hey,
right there right there.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:11.175
I need me a beer.

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:20.317
Oh.

01:05:24.755 --> 01:05:26.758
- Thank you, pretty woman.
- You're welcome.

01:05:34.866 --> 01:05:36.432
You look like
you could use one.

01:05:36.434 --> 01:05:37.536
Oh, thank you.

01:05:38.603 --> 01:05:39.704
Do you mind telling me
what happened?

01:05:40.205 --> 01:05:41.706
No. I... I don't mind. Sam?

01:05:42.307 --> 01:05:43.740
- Mm?
- You... You never told

01:05:43.742 --> 01:05:45.376
- her the story?
- No, I did not.

01:05:45.576 --> 01:05:46.577
Well...

01:05:47.311 --> 01:05:48.813
have yourself a seat,
and I'll...

01:05:49.648 --> 01:05:51.215
tell you the story about...

01:05:53.183 --> 01:05:55.654
how I got my nickname,
and how Sam here saved my life.

01:05:56.721 --> 01:05:59.322
- Sam saved your life?
- Yes, he did.

01:05:59.324 --> 01:06:00.492
Well, I ain't no beggar.

01:06:01.693 --> 01:06:04.129
I think sometimes
he regrets it though.

01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:06.264
Was it
a racing accident?

01:06:07.499 --> 01:06:09.801
I wish. Because of this leg,
I never got my chance to race.

01:06:11.369 --> 01:06:12.571
What happened?

01:06:13.605 --> 01:06:16.141
It was, uh, the hottest day
of the summer.

01:06:17.142 --> 01:06:19.511
The summer of '73 to be exact.

01:06:20.812 --> 01:06:22.545
Me and Sam,
we decided to go down

01:06:22.547 --> 01:06:23.481
to our favorite fishing hole,

01:06:24.784 --> 01:06:27.419
and, uh, we were down there
a couple of hours,

01:06:28.286 --> 01:06:29.352
but for some reason,
the fish,

01:06:29.354 --> 01:06:30.623
they just weren't...
weren't biting.

01:06:31.189 --> 01:06:34.424
I mean, no matter what
we tried, bacon, worms,

01:06:34.426 --> 01:06:35.327
rooster tails.

01:06:36.494 --> 01:06:38.896
- Should've used hot dogs.
- You and your damn hot dogs.

01:06:38.898 --> 01:06:40.496
- I'm just saying
- I don't remember you

01:06:40.498 --> 01:06:41.698
catching any fish
that day either.

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.636
That's 'cause I didn't have
any hot dogs.

01:06:44.169 --> 01:06:46.639
If you're finished making
light of my lost leg,

01:06:46.839 --> 01:06:48.472
I'd like to get on
with my story.

01:06:48.474 --> 01:06:49.375
Sorry. Go right ahead.

01:06:50.476 --> 01:06:52.810
I decided to go down
the bank around 50 feet

01:06:52.812 --> 01:06:53.813
and try my luck.

01:06:55.014 --> 01:06:58.717
So, I... I cast my line in
and waited for a few minutes.

01:06:59.952 --> 01:07:00.853
Nothing.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.187
So, I started to reel her in,
and I got my...

01:07:04.189 --> 01:07:07.192
my line caught on a-
snagged on a weeds or some...

01:07:07.727 --> 01:07:11.731
old tree trunk or something,
and so I waded out,

01:07:12.431 --> 01:07:13.633
to try to get her unhooked,

01:07:14.834 --> 01:07:16.736
and that's when I found out
why the fish weren't biting.

01:07:17.703 --> 01:07:18.604
Why?

01:07:19.438 --> 01:07:23.641
Gator. 12-foot,
a hungry alligator.

01:07:23.643 --> 01:07:25.408
- It was more like eight foot.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:29.213
Hey. If it's a gator chewing off
your leg,

01:07:29.215 --> 01:07:30.914
you can call it eight foot,
all right?

01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:32.650
But it's my leg
and it's my story,

01:07:32.652 --> 01:07:34.418
and that gator was 12-foot.

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:36.420
- All right, all right, all right
- Okay?

01:07:36.422 --> 01:07:39.223
I apologize, I made a mistake.
It was 12-foot.

01:07:39.225 --> 01:07:40.859
- So...
- Might have been 15-foot.

01:07:40.861 --> 01:07:42.261
- Twelve foot.
- Or 20.

01:07:42.763 --> 01:07:48.768
Anyway. So that giant
12-foot alligator,

01:07:49.368 --> 01:07:51.301
he got a hold of my leg,
and he started

01:07:51.303 --> 01:07:52.638
to drag me under.

01:07:53.372 --> 01:07:55.374
Well, I just figured
I was a goner.

01:07:56.342 --> 01:07:59.578
But them Sam,
he grabs both my arms.

01:08:00.413 --> 01:08:03.917
So, there I am stuck in
a tug of war, Sam on one side,

01:08:04.918 --> 01:08:05.919
gator on the other.

01:08:06.987 --> 01:08:08.954
The next thing I remember,
I was in the hospital.

01:08:10.656 --> 01:08:13.259
And that's when I found out
that Sam here, he, uh...

01:08:13.626 --> 01:08:16.261
he tied his belt around
what was left of my leg.

01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:20.433
He hauled me all the way up
the road, flagged down a car,

01:08:20.834 --> 01:08:22.268
and took me to
the emergency room.

01:08:29.943 --> 01:08:31.877
And I'm lucky to have
Sam as a friend.

01:08:33.046 --> 01:08:36.046
- Ain't that right, Sam?
- Yeah, lucky.

01:08:36.049 --> 01:08:38.314
- Yeah.
- It ain't nothing, really.

01:08:38.317 --> 01:08:39.586
I... anybody ought have done it.

01:08:40.419 --> 01:08:41.553
Anybody would've
done it?

01:08:41.555 --> 01:08:42.687
Yeah. Come on.

01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:45.859
Come on.
You're my hero.

01:09:59.066 --> 01:10:00.802
- What are you doing here?
- Abby's asleep.

01:10:01.736 --> 01:10:04.539
- What are you doing here?
- He's inside.

01:10:14.381 --> 01:10:15.449
Sorry.

01:10:25.459 --> 01:10:28.795
Hey. How you feeling?

01:11:44.139 --> 01:11:45.604
You're getting old, Stumpy.

01:11:45.606 --> 01:11:46.907
You better watch
your mouth, young man.

01:11:46.909 --> 01:11:49.011
I'm gonna kick your butt.

01:11:49.211 --> 01:11:50.746
Oh, yeah? With which leg?

01:11:51.613 --> 01:11:53.415
With the stump,
then I could leave it in you.

<i>Champion's Race Weekend,</i>

<i>here at the Talladega

01:13:25.675 --> 01:13:28.177
- Good luck, and stay safe, okay?
- Thank you.

01:13:40.724 --> 01:13:42.626
- You're all set.
- Thanks, Pop.

01:13:42.893 --> 01:13:45.161
All right.
Lemme help you out.

01:13:48.598 --> 01:13:50.967
Time to trade some paint.
You ready?

01:13:51.168 --> 01:13:52.236
I sure am, Pop.

01:13:54.637 --> 01:13:55.638
I'm proud of you, son.

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:02.044
<i>Tonight we welcome
the return of Cam Munroe,</i>

01:14:02.046 --> 01:14:04.179
<i>who six months ago
was barely able to walk</i>

01:14:04.181 --> 01:14:06.648
<i>after a horrendous crash
where he was hit</i>

01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:08.118
<i>by his father, Sam.</i>

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:12.154
<i>This is the most
important race of the year,</i>

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:14.690
<i>folks, and you're
gonna be track side.</i>

01:14:18.295 --> 01:14:22.864
<i>There's the rumble
of 900 horsepower times 24,</i>

01:14:22.866 --> 01:14:26.101
<i>featuring the best super late
model racers</i>

01:14:26.103 --> 01:14:27.172
<i>in the entire county.</i>

01:14:31.242 --> 01:14:33.075
<i>And here comes
the green flag</i>

01:14:33.077 --> 01:14:37.045
<i>to start the action for the
16th annual Champion's Race.</i>

01:14:37.047 --> 01:14:39.748
<i>They take off
with the thundering power</i>

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:42.619
<i>so loud it's literally shaking
my seat.</i>

01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:56.131
<i>A lot of history
with Cam Munroe and Linsky.</i>

01:14:56.133 --> 01:14:59.000
<i>Some folks around these
parts think Linsky orchestrated</i>

01:14:59.002 --> 01:15:02.338
<i>Cam's crash, and to say there's
bad blood between</i>

01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:04.840
<i>the Munroes and Linsky,
well, I say...</i>

01:15:04.842 --> 01:15:06.442
<i>That's
an understatement for sure,</i>

01:15:06.444 --> 01:15:10.215
<i>as the racing action
starts to get hot and heavy.</i>

01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:17.987
<i>Side by side,
Munroe and Linsky come off</i>

01:15:17.989 --> 01:15:19.788
<i>turn two. They're going at it</i>

01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:21.725
<i>like a couple of
prize fighters here tonight.</i>

01:15:22.092 --> 01:15:24.726
<i>It's a super tight
race with Linsky holding onto</i>

01:15:24.728 --> 01:15:25.997
<i>the slimmest of leads.</i>

01:16:00.466 --> 01:16:02.865
<i>Two laps to go in
an epic championship race.</i>

01:16:02.867 --> 01:16:06.438
<i>Bob Linsky and Cam Munroe
letting it hang out tonight.</i>

01:16:08.139 --> 01:16:10.106
<i>Linsky dive bombs Munroe.</i>

01:16:10.108 --> 01:16:12.875
<i>Munroe spins
towards the bottom of track.</i>

01:16:12.877 --> 01:16:15.011
<i>Linsky spins out Cam Munroe</i>

01:16:15.013 --> 01:16:15.947
<i>and keeps the lead.</i>

01:16:17.215 --> 01:16:20.082
<i>Wow. Cam Munroe
is completely stalled out</i>

01:16:20.084 --> 01:16:21.086
<i>coming out of turn two.</i>

01:16:26.792 --> 01:16:29.895
<i>There's the yellow caution
flag for the rest of the field.</i>

01:16:32.864 --> 01:16:35.532
<i>Cam Munroe needs
to get his car started before</i>

01:16:35.534 --> 01:16:38.736
<i>Linsky makes it around to
lap him, or he is disqualified.</i>

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:40.306
<i>Linksy would love that.</i>

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:43.373
<i>Unfortunately,
time is running out</i>

01:16:43.375 --> 01:16:44.975
<i>for Cam Munroe
as Linsky approaches.</i>

01:16:44.977 --> 01:16:46.178
<i>This will end it for him.</i>

01:16:47.346 --> 01:16:50.216
<i>Hang on!
Cam Munroe's car fires up!</i>

01:16:51.116 --> 01:16:52.785
<i>He's got a chance here, folks!</i>

01:16:58.190 --> 01:17:00.457
<i>There goes Cam Munroe
like a rocket!</i>

01:17:03.295 --> 01:17:04.895
<i>He's gotta get
all the way around</i>

01:17:04.897 --> 01:17:06.396
<i>the track now to catch
the rest of the field</i>

01:17:06.398 --> 01:17:08.067
<i>with only two laps to go.</i>

01:17:09.001 --> 01:17:11.835
<i>Cam is revving
that car up to full speed,</i>

01:17:11.837 --> 01:17:13.837
<i>and he's gonna try
to time it just right</i>

01:17:13.839 --> 01:17:16.807
<i>to slingshot into the pack
as the green flag comes out.</i>

01:17:16.809 --> 01:17:18.942
<i>Here comes
Cam Munroe like a bullet,</i>

01:17:18.944 --> 01:17:20.510
<i>slingshotting his way
into the pack.</i>

01:17:20.512 --> 01:17:22.946
<i>He's flying,
passing two or three cars</i>

01:17:22.948 --> 01:17:23.949
<i>at a time.</i>

01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:26.218
<i>Can he even
get close to Linsky?</i>

01:17:32.124 --> 01:17:35.025
<i>Munroe slips by
two more cars and now</i>

01:17:35.027 --> 01:17:38.096
<i>he's in second place!
I've never seen anyone</i>

01:17:38.098 --> 01:17:41.001
<i>carve through heavy traffic
like that.</i>

01:17:43.936 --> 01:17:46.305
<i>Dead even coming off
turn number four</i>

01:17:46.505 --> 01:17:48.506
<i>and down the
front straightaway.</i>

01:17:48.508 --> 01:17:50.776
<i>Is it possible
for him to pull off a miracle?</i>

01:17:52.479 --> 01:17:55.480
<i>Checkered flag comes out.
Only one lap to go.</i>

01:17:55.482 --> 01:17:58.249
<i>Linsky is in the lead.
Everything on the line.</i>

01:17:58.251 --> 01:18:00.885
<i>Cam Munroe is storming
after Bob Linsky.</i>

01:18:00.887 --> 01:18:05.223
<i>Munroe cuts inside,
has the line! He has the line!</i>

01:18:05.225 --> 01:18:06.860
<i>He has the line!</i>

01:19:20.333 --> 01:19:21.434
I love you.

01:19:30.944 --> 01:19:32.079
Whoo!

01:19:41.523 --> 01:19:44.525
Wow,
what an incredible performance!

01:19:45.125 --> 01:19:48.360
Incredible. Congratulations
on the victory, Cam.

01:19:48.362 --> 01:19:49.363
Thanks! Thank you.

01:19:49.563 --> 01:19:51.964
After the spinout,
you charged

01:19:51.966 --> 01:19:54.633
through the rest of the field,
and everyone here in

01:19:54.635 --> 01:19:56.602
the crowd was on their feet
rooting for you.

01:19:56.604 --> 01:19:57.639
It was amazing.

01:19:58.707 --> 01:20:02.207
Well, I wish I could
take all the credit for it,

01:20:02.209 --> 01:20:05.547
but, uh... I have to give
a big shout out to my pop.

01:20:08.215 --> 01:20:10.017
I wouldn't be here without you.

01:20:12.486 --> 01:20:13.621
You're my hero. I love you.

01:20:14.655 --> 01:20:18.357
- I love you too.
- Uh... When we lost Mom,

01:20:18.359 --> 01:20:19.360
you were my rock.

01:20:20.562 --> 01:20:24.266
I have had no one but you,
so I love you. I love you, Pop.

01:20:24.466 --> 01:20:25.467
I love you too.

01:20:28.236 --> 01:20:31.472
And, um...
to my beautiful wife, Cindy.

01:20:32.473 --> 01:20:37.042
Uh... Baby, I'm so truly blessed
to have you by my side.

01:20:37.044 --> 01:20:37.945
Thank you.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.680
Let's all
hear it for our winner,

01:20:40.682 --> 01:20:45.019
Cam Munroe!

01:22:07.369 --> 01:22:08.270
Hey!

01:22:37.533 --> 01:22:40.236
Yes!

01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:45.308
Did you make a wish?
