01:23.960 --> 01:26.500
Hey, let me see!

01:30.000 --> 01:32.420
What a perfect day!

01:32.420 --> 01:34.540
Lucky: Nothing could ruin
a day like this.

01:34.540 --> 01:35.880
Not even--

01:47.040 --> 01:47.960
The vet!

01:47.960 --> 01:49.210
The vet?

01:49.210 --> 01:51.120
-The vet!

01:51.120 --> 01:53.620
What's she doing here?

01:53.620 --> 01:56.210
Let's see,
no one's sick.

01:56.210 --> 01:57.830
No one's hurt.

01:57.830 --> 02:00.170
Guess that means
we're getting shots.

02:00.170 --> 02:01.620
Shots?

02:01.620 --> 02:02.960
That's right.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.380
Mom said we've
gotta get shots

02:04.380 --> 02:06.960
so we don't get
itchy-swell-anosis.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.620
That's where you
turn pink and green

02:08.620 --> 02:10.580
and you swell up
and get itchy.

02:10.580 --> 02:12.040
Nosis.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.170
Shots.

02:13.170 --> 02:16.880
Oh, I can't wait.
Dr. Whittaker's a babe.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.120
And we get treats
after our shots!

02:19.120 --> 02:20.580
Shots.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.040
Relax! It's just
a little shot.

02:36.040 --> 02:40.380
Yeah, there's
no big, long, scary
needles or nothin'.

02:42.420 --> 02:44.830
Oh, boy,
was I wrong.

02:44.830 --> 02:46.920
Yeah.
Sorry, Lucky.

02:53.420 --> 02:54.880
Uhhh.

02:56.330 --> 02:57.960
Ohh!

02:57.960 --> 03:01.120
You're not suffering from
shot anxiety, are you, Lucky?

03:01.120 --> 03:03.920
Lucky, afraid
of a little shot?

03:03.920 --> 03:06.500
Ha! Lucky and I laugh
at shots.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.080
We have shots
for breakfast.

03:08.080 --> 03:11.580
Ha
Puh-lease!

03:11.580 --> 03:13.540
-Lucky: Ugh!

03:15.960 --> 03:19.750
Whittaker: Oh, Spot,
time for your chickenpox shot.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.210
Come on, Lucky.

03:26.210 --> 03:29.170
Mr. Vaccine has a needle
with your name on it.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.290
You guys go ahead,
I'm gonna hide.

03:34.290 --> 03:37.710
Uh, I mean, I'd better go
round up the others.

03:37.710 --> 03:40.830
Yeah, I think I'll go
round up the others.

03:51.670 --> 03:52.790
Aaaaah!

03:52.790 --> 03:55.210
all: Hi, Lucky.
Goin' to the vet?

03:55.210 --> 03:58.750
V
Uh, isn't everybody?

04:14.170 --> 04:16.830
Hi, Lucky.
Goin' to the vet?

04:16.830 --> 04:18.880
Aaaaah!

04:23.790 --> 04:24.830
Hi, Lucky!

04:24.830 --> 04:26.210
Aaaah!

04:26.210 --> 04:27.710
Goin' to the vet?

04:37.620 --> 04:41.290
Hi, Lucky,
Goin' to the vet?

04:45.460 --> 04:46.750
Uggh! Ooh!

04:48.670 --> 04:50.420
Whoa!

04:53.710 --> 04:56.580
Aaaah!

04:58.540 --> 05:02.380
Whoa-oh!

05:08.040 --> 05:11.330
Hi, Lucky!
Goin' to the vet?

05:11.330 --> 05:14.080
Lucky: Whoa!

05:14.080 --> 05:16.710
I'm never goin' to the vet.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.540
They'll never
take me alive.

05:28.540 --> 05:32.420
Where can I hide
where there's no puppies?

05:32.420 --> 05:33.710
Huh?

05:48.420 --> 05:49.960
Perfect.

06:08.330 --> 06:10.420
All right, who's next?

06:13.960 --> 06:15.750
Uggh!

06:22.290 --> 06:24.040
Cruella:
What's that awful noise?

06:25.170 --> 06:26.750
Beat it!

06:27.710 --> 06:28.880
Whew!

06:30.290 --> 06:32.880
It's still better
than getting a shot.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.620
Oh, this is going
to be gorgeous.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.620
Then again, if I'm wearing it,
that goes without saying.

06:57.290 --> 06:58.460
Heh heh heh!

06:58.460 --> 07:00.790
Cruella: Pins!
I need pins!

07:00.790 --> 07:03.040
Bring me my pin cushion!

07:11.580 --> 07:14.620
And my yarn.
Bring me some yarn!

07:14.620 --> 07:16.540
Horace: Coming, Madame.

07:20.420 --> 07:23.790
Cruella: And my fabrics.
Bring me the blue fabrics.

07:23.790 --> 07:26.080
Horace:
Coming right up, ladies.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.040
Jasper: Eh, shut up.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.620
Horace: Hee hee hee!

07:36.540 --> 07:38.920
Hmm, hmm...

07:41.040 --> 07:44.580
Well, I think
it looks lovely.

07:44.580 --> 07:46.540
Straighten up.
Chest out.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.540
Suck in that gut!

07:51.040 --> 07:52.710
Say, what's this?

07:52.710 --> 07:54.620
Ooh!

07:54.620 --> 07:56.880
No, no, no,
it's awful!

07:56.880 --> 07:58.420
Get rid of it.

07:58.420 --> 08:00.920
Only too happy, ma'am.

08:08.830 --> 08:10.620
Uggh!

08:13.420 --> 08:16.620
It's still better than
getting a shot.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.540
Maybe the vet's gone.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.250
She's gotta leave sometime.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.540
Ugh, still there!

08:24.540 --> 08:26.210
Those poor puppies.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.290
Oooh!

08:39.000 --> 08:41.500
What's she gonna do,
stay there all day?

08:41.500 --> 08:44.000
I mean, I can't hide
in here forever.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.830
But then, I guess
it still beats

08:47.830 --> 08:49.540
getting a shot, huh?

08:50.580 --> 08:52.170
Aaaah!

08:53.880 --> 08:55.380
Lucky: Yike!

08:57.170 --> 08:59.880
Whoa-oh-oh!

08:59.880 --> 09:02.080
Ooh! Whoa!

09:04.120 --> 09:05.330
Whoa!

09:06.620 --> 09:09.380
Aaaaah...

09:12.830 --> 09:14.120
Whew!

09:16.460 --> 09:18.880
Uggh! Whoa!

09:46.210 --> 09:48.960
Still better than getting
a shot.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.080
-Cruella: I hate working out.
-Woman: Do not worry.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.460
That is why you hire
a personal trainer,

09:54.460 --> 09:58.000
and believe me, I am going
to make you feel like a new man.

10:00.830 --> 10:02.420
Uh... woman.

10:02.420 --> 10:06.040
Well then, shall we
start with the treadmill?

10:06.040 --> 10:08.750
Don't want to overdo it.
We'll skip to the rubdown.

10:08.750 --> 10:10.460
Woman: Yes, Madame.

10:16.580 --> 10:19.210
Oh, this is more like it.

10:19.210 --> 10:20.880
Start with the feet.

10:24.540 --> 10:27.380
Oh, marvelous!

10:27.380 --> 10:30.460
Now, between the toes.

10:40.420 --> 10:43.540
I can't stand it anymore.
I give up.

10:43.540 --> 10:46.250
I'll take it.
Go get her.

10:46.250 --> 10:47.290
Huh?

10:47.290 --> 10:49.830
The shot.
I'll take the shot.

10:49.830 --> 10:52.170
Go get her.
Go get the vet.

10:52.170 --> 10:53.420
I give up.

10:53.420 --> 10:56.420
The vet's gone, Lucky.
You missed her.

10:56.420 --> 10:58.420
Oh, yeah?

10:58.420 --> 10:59.500
Bummer.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.750
But, hey, I tried

11:00.750 --> 11:01.880
to find her, right?

11:01.880 --> 11:04.000
And anyway,
what can happen?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.580
Hey, Lucky, one of your spots
just turned pink.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.540
Aaah! Wow!

11:10.540 --> 11:12.670
Rolly: Itchy-swell-anosis.

11:12.670 --> 11:15.420
Now his fur will
turn green.

11:16.670 --> 11:18.330
Spot: Wow!

11:18.330 --> 11:20.580
Rolly:
Yep. Now his nose.

11:22.380 --> 11:24.620
Everybody stay back!

11:24.620 --> 11:27.080
He's highly contagious!

11:27.080 --> 11:28.670
Uggh!

11:28.670 --> 11:32.210
There. Now, was that so bad?

11:32.210 --> 11:34.330
Oh, just give me the cookie!

11:36.420 --> 11:37.540
Ouch!

11:50.460 --> 11:52.500
Now, Rex Hunter!

11:52.500 --> 11:56.750
Witness the power of
Dr. Wonko's Death-o-matic Ray.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.170
Not available
in stores anywhere.

11:59.170 --> 12:02.380
X marks the spot.
Heh-heh!

12:02.380 --> 12:05.500
Wonko, Wonko, Wonko.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.880
I hope you realize

12:06.880 --> 12:08.210
my intrepid partner
Thunderbolt

12:08.210 --> 12:10.790
is on his way
even as we speak.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.080
Let the cur come.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.790
Every entrance has been
hermetically sealed

12:14.790 --> 12:16.880
and sprayed with dog repellant.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.250
It's too late.

12:18.250 --> 12:22.250
Your precious pet has finally
let you down.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.710
No!

12:35.710 --> 12:37.790
No, no!

12:37.790 --> 12:40.000
No!

12:40.000 --> 12:42.460
Is it any wonder
I'm a cat person?

12:42.460 --> 12:43.620
Lucky: Hey!

12:43.620 --> 12:45.500
Who shut it off?

12:45.500 --> 12:47.920
Sorry, I thought it was over.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.670
Aw, what's it matter?

12:49.670 --> 12:52.460
All that's left was
a preview of tomorrow's show.

12:52.460 --> 12:55.250
And we know what that
will be like.

12:55.250 --> 12:58.000
A little gratuitous violence,
a little male bonding,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.790
a big explosion at the end,
kablam!

13:00.790 --> 13:02.330
They're all the same.

13:02.330 --> 13:04.580
I still wanted to see it.

13:04.580 --> 13:07.330
Thunderbolt's the only
excitement I get around here.

13:07.330 --> 13:09.330
Ya lookin' for excitement?

13:09.330 --> 13:12.460
Rumor in the henhouse is
that somebody--

13:12.460 --> 13:15.500
possibly Naomi--
laid an egg...

13:15.500 --> 13:18.540
with two yolks.

13:18.540 --> 13:21.080
Rolly: Hey, hey,
I dug up a shoe...

13:21.080 --> 13:23.080
Open-toed.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.210
Somebody put me
out of my misery.

13:26.210 --> 13:29.330
I wasn't meant to live
the life of a farm animal.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.580
I need adventure, excitement,
like Thunderbolt.

13:32.580 --> 13:34.880
I should be battling
insidious villains,

13:34.880 --> 13:36.670
facing fur-raising danger,

13:36.670 --> 13:40.290
boldly going where no puppy
has gone before.

13:41.330 --> 13:44.170
Welcome to Lucky's
Rich Fantasy Life.

13:44.170 --> 13:46.250
And now
back to reality.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.290
Spot: Shh!
Do you hear something?

13:50.250 --> 13:53.670
It's a message coming in
on the barking chain, you guys.

13:53.670 --> 13:57.830
Oh, boy, the barking chain.
That's excitement.

13:57.830 --> 13:59.290
It's probably that schnauzer

13:59.290 --> 14:01.460
complaining about
his ringworm again.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.080
It's from Kelly,

14:05.080 --> 14:08.210
the big sheepdog
with the control issues.

14:08.210 --> 14:12.120
Lamb... strayed from flock...
runaway...

14:12.120 --> 14:15.290
Last seen...
spreading a cloud?

14:15.290 --> 14:18.210
That's "heading for town."

14:18.210 --> 14:20.120
Requesting help.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.710
Bark Brigade, please find lamb
and return.

14:23.710 --> 14:25.290
Transmission over.

14:25.290 --> 14:28.170
A lamb? How lame.

14:28.170 --> 14:30.120
Wonder what poor suckers
are gonna get stuck

14:30.120 --> 14:33.290
with that bogus assignment.

14:33.290 --> 14:37.210
Platoon, our fugitive has been
on the lam for six hours.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.170
That means he could be
anywhere in town.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.250
What I want out of
every one of you

14:41.250 --> 14:43.710
is a soft-target search,
by the book.

14:43.710 --> 14:47.830
No barking, no marking,
no begging for handouts.

14:47.830 --> 14:49.710
Whoopity-doo!

14:49.710 --> 14:53.210
Got a problem there,
Cadet Lucky?

14:53.210 --> 14:57.380
Why can't we get
an exciting assignment,
like Thunderbolt does?

14:57.380 --> 15:01.750
Because, grunt,
you are no TV star!

15:01.750 --> 15:03.920
This is real life!

15:03.920 --> 15:07.040
So get
your tail-draggin'
butts into town

15:07.040 --> 15:09.670
and let's fetch
that lamb!

15:27.210 --> 15:31.880
Yuck! Phew! That lamb's
close by, for sure.

15:42.540 --> 15:46.000
That's funny.
The scent ends here.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.380
Oh, if I didn't know better,

15:48.380 --> 15:51.880
I'd swear this was the old
"garbage in the alley" trap.

16:00.620 --> 16:03.210
Someone's going
to have to re-sort

16:03.210 --> 16:05.540
all this for recycling.

16:05.540 --> 16:07.290
Pug: I'm trapped...

16:07.290 --> 16:11.790
like a bulldog
under a grocery cart!

16:11.790 --> 16:15.580
Poor Pug!
He's metaphorically challenged.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.960
Baa-a-a-ad dogs!

16:18.960 --> 16:21.000
You lookin' for me?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.670
You're barkin'
up the wrong tree.

16:23.670 --> 16:26.170
I'm no little lost lamb!

16:26.170 --> 16:28.960
I'm Lambo!

16:33.290 --> 16:34.830
Cool!

16:34.830 --> 16:37.080
Lambo: Let this bee-e-e
a warnin'.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.380
I'm never goin' baa-a-ack
to the flock.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.710
Ne-e-ever!

16:42.710 --> 16:44.040
all: Yow!

16:47.790 --> 16:52.330
I'll have that kid's hide
for car seat covers!

16:52.330 --> 16:55.790
I'll grind his innards
into haggis!

16:55.790 --> 16:56.960
I'll...

17:03.920 --> 17:07.880
He'll... probably be
asleep for hours.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.960
Well, now
what do we do?

17:11.960 --> 17:13.790
Bark Brigade
procedure is clear.

17:13.790 --> 17:15.330
Turn tail and run!

17:15.330 --> 17:18.170
What? At the first sign
of excitement?

17:18.170 --> 17:19.330
No way!

17:19.330 --> 17:21.830
We're gonna march out there
and trap Lambo.

17:21.830 --> 17:24.040
Just like Thunderbolt would do.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.120
But this isn't TV,
this is real life.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.750
That could be
d-d-dangerous!

17:29.750 --> 17:31.710
I live for danger.

17:31.710 --> 17:34.500
They don't call me
"Luckybolt" for nothin'.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.830
Come on!

17:35.830 --> 17:38.920
All right,
who called him
"Luckybolt"?

17:40.080 --> 17:42.330
Spot: I've got a bad feeling
about this.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.670
Ha! I knew you'd get hungry.

18:04.670 --> 18:07.880
Surrender, Lambo.
Resistance is futile.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.420
Buzz off, bow-wow!

18:10.420 --> 18:12.830
Spot, air support!

18:14.960 --> 18:17.080
Patrol, yo!

18:17.080 --> 18:19.210
Nice try!

18:37.210 --> 18:41.250
Rolly: I don't remember this
ever happening to Thunderbolt.

18:41.250 --> 18:45.500
Cadpig: But this is Luckybolt,
the danger never stops.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.420
Lucky: Just a minor setback.

18:47.420 --> 18:50.500
I've already got a plan
for another trap.

18:56.750 --> 19:00.830
(music box playing
"Mary Had a Little Lamb")

19:00.830 --> 19:06.040
"Mary Had a Little Laaaamb"?
Stop that! It's demeaning!

19:07.330 --> 19:10.380
I said stop that!

19:10.380 --> 19:11.790
Yah!

19:17.880 --> 19:18.880
Cadpig: Whoops!

19:18.880 --> 19:21.040
Lambo: Aaaaah!

19:41.000 --> 19:42.670
-Ewww!
-Ptooey!

19:42.670 --> 19:45.540
It's fertilizer!

19:47.420 --> 19:49.380
I wish you hadn't
told me that.

19:49.380 --> 19:51.750
Oh, where's Lucky?

19:54.460 --> 19:58.750
Lucky: Don't worry, it's all
part of my master plaaaan!

19:58.750 --> 20:00.210
Come on!

20:00.210 --> 20:02.750
Spot: And I thought we were
in deep... uh, trouble.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.420
Quit complainin'.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.750
I warned you

20:14.750 --> 20:17.080
to leave me beeee!

20:18.620 --> 20:20.250
Heh-heh!

20:20.250 --> 20:24.790
Cadpig: Yoo-hoo!
Mr. Lambo, are you in?

20:24.790 --> 20:28.210
Hello, I'm Cadpig,
your crisis facilitator.

20:28.210 --> 20:30.540
I'll be negotiating
today's hostage release.

20:30.540 --> 20:33.460
Nobody's negotiating
anything.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.830
You can talk yourself
blue in the face.

20:35.830 --> 20:37.580
Don't mind if I do.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.500
Perhaps we should start

20:40.500 --> 20:42.920
with your need to rebel
against the herd mentality...

20:42.920 --> 20:44.710
...when the urge
for self-expression

20:44.710 --> 20:46.750
emerges from
the sea of conformity,

20:46.750 --> 20:49.960
displaying all the classical
eccentric behaviors,

20:49.960 --> 20:51.250
manifesting...

20:51.250 --> 20:53.830
Lambo:
Aaaah! Stop that!

20:53.830 --> 20:57.880
It's like fingernails on
the blackboard of my brain!

20:57.880 --> 21:01.000
It's driving me insaaaane!

21:14.580 --> 21:15.880
Pug: Cadet Capon,

21:15.880 --> 21:17.880
you are to be
commended

21:17.880 --> 21:20.580
for your bravery
and cleverness.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.540
No one can
talk their way
out of a fight

21:23.540 --> 21:24.790
like you have.

21:24.790 --> 21:26.580
Thank you, sir.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.880
And as for you,
Cadet "Lacky,"

21:28.880 --> 21:31.250
you're a disgrace
to this corps!

21:31.250 --> 21:32.460
You deserve to be

21:32.460 --> 21:35.330
in your stubby
condition.

21:35.330 --> 21:37.710
Cadpig:
Lucky, are you decent?

21:37.710 --> 21:40.210
Yeah, come on in.

21:40.210 --> 21:41.790
Are you okay?

21:41.790 --> 21:44.920
I will be if my coat
ever grows back.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.040
We helped Pug take
Lambo back to the flock.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.750
Kelly asked us
to thank you personally.

21:50.750 --> 21:54.290
You're a hero,
just like on TV.

21:54.290 --> 21:57.790
Some hero. Nothing went
the way I planned it.

21:57.790 --> 21:59.830
The bad guy beat me
at every turn,

21:59.830 --> 22:01.330
and look at how it ended.

22:01.330 --> 22:03.620
I got plucked like a chicken.

22:03.620 --> 22:05.040
No offense, Spot.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.750
None taken, baldy!
