CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
PARAMOUNT PICTURES CORPORATION

02:09.930 --> 02:13.301
FOLKS, WE'VE BEEN HERE
FOR A LONG TIME NOW,

02:13.301 --> 02:17.171
LISTENING TO PEOPLE
TALK FOR MONTHS.

02:18.172 --> 02:21.175
COMPLICATED
MEDICAL TESTIMONY.

02:23.311 --> 02:26.580
A LOT OF EMOTION
IN THIS CASE.

02:27.548 --> 02:30.451
THERE IS NOT A PERSON
IN THIS ROOM

02:30.451 --> 02:34.322
WHO ISN'T SORRY ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO MR. MATTHEWS.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.857
IT'S A TRAGEDY.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.328
AND WHEN SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPENS,

02:40.328 --> 02:43.931
YOU DESPERATELY WANT
TO BLAME SOMEONE, DON'T YOU?

02:43.931 --> 02:45.333
SOMEONE ELSE.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.868
WE UNDERSTAND THAT.
IT'S NATURAL.

02:51.739 --> 02:55.209
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?
WHAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE?

02:56.210 --> 02:58.612
IT'S MR. MATTHEWS' WORD

02:58.612 --> 03:02.550
AGAINST THE EAST SHORE
HOSPITAL, ISN'T IT?

03:03.417 --> 03:05.819
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

03:07.421 --> 03:10.558
NOW, OBVIOUSLY,
ANY DECENT HUMAN BEING

03:10.558 --> 03:13.561
WOULD WANT TO BELIEVE
MR. MATTHEWS--

03:13.561 --> 03:17.030
BELIEVE THAT HE TOLD THE
ADMITTING NURSE, MRS. VALDEZ,

03:17.030 --> 03:18.899
THAT HE WAS DIABETIC.

03:18.899 --> 03:22.303
IT WOULD SEEM,
UH...POETIC

03:22.303 --> 03:24.305
THAT SOMEONE ELSE
WAS TO BLAME.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.706
IT WOULD FEEL RIGHT.

03:25.706 --> 03:29.443
BUT, UH...
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.445
LET'S--LET'S
THINK FOR A SECOND.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.581
WHO'S BEING BLAMED HERE?

03:33.581 --> 03:38.185
IT'S NOT SOME BIG, BAD
HOSPITAL CORPORATION.

03:38.185 --> 03:41.188
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS--

03:41.188 --> 03:42.990
FOUR DOCTORS, FIVE NURSES,

03:42.990 --> 03:46.594
THE HOSPITAL CHIEF OF STAFF
PRESENT AT THE TIME--

03:46.594 --> 03:48.996
ALL OF THEM THERE
FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE

03:48.996 --> 03:53.734
THAN TO TRY AND SAVE
JONATHAN MATTHEWS' LIFE.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.203
I DON'T LIKE
DOING THIS,

03:56.203 --> 03:58.739
BUT IF WE'RE ALL
GOING TO DO OUR JOBS,

03:58.739 --> 04:01.008
I'VE GOT TO
BRING THIS UP AGAIN.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.776
MR. MATTHEWS
IS AN ALCOHOLIC.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.913
IN JULY OF 1979,
HE TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.916
AND YOU KNOW, EVEN I WAS
SURPRISED TO LEARN--

04:08.916 --> 04:12.420
FROM THE PLAINTIFF'S
OWN DOCTORS, IRONICALLY--

04:12.420 --> 04:15.255
THAT THIS TRAGEDY
COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED

04:15.255 --> 04:17.391
BY THE ABUSE OF ALCOHOL.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.261
SO HERE'S MY POINT--

04:22.195 --> 04:23.597
WE ALL UNDERSTAND

04:23.597 --> 04:28.469
WHY MR. MATTHEWS
IS BLAMING THE HOSPITAL.

04:30.003 --> 04:33.474
BUT NOBODY COULD HAVE PREVENTED
MR. MATTHEWS' SUFFERING

04:33.474 --> 04:36.310
EXCEPT MR. MATTHEWS.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.816
LISTEN TO ME.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.117
LISTEN TO ME.

04:44.117 --> 04:48.322
THE TABLE YOU DELIVERED
IS NOT THE TABLE I ORDERED.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.591
I'M HAVING A PARTY
ON FRIDAY,

04:50.591 --> 04:53.193
AND THE TABLE
SITTING IN MY DINING ROOM

04:53.193 --> 04:55.996
LOOKS LIKE
A GODDAMN TURTLE.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.579
"WE FIND FOR THE DEFENDANT
ON ALL COUNTS."

05:17.050 --> 05:18.318
THAT WAS GREAT.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.787
GREAT, HENRY.

05:19.787 --> 05:20.988
BRUCE.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.865
I'LL SEE YOU
BACK AT THE OFFICE.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.340
MR. MATTHEWS, EVERYONE.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.642
BOTTOMS UP.

05:44.745 --> 05:45.879
MR. CAMERON.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.281
AH. THANKS.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.817
LIKE FATHER,
LIKE SON.

05:49.817 --> 05:53.421
YEAH. THE OLD BASTARD
WOULD HAVE LOVED THIS ONE.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.956
ONLY IF HE'D
PULLED IT OFF.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.128
MR. TURNER.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.396
IF MAXWELL CALLS,

06:02.396 --> 06:04.398
TELL HIM
WE WON EAST SHORE,

06:04.398 --> 06:05.799
AND HE OWES ME 50.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.401
DON'T
GIVE ME THIS NOW.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.002
CANCEL
MY LUNCH TOMORROW.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.270
I'M WORKING THROUGH.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.105
MOVE THE DINNER
TO NEXT WEEK.

BRIGGS VS. GORDON.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.009
WHAT ABOUT
THE ROSENBERG BREAKFA--

06:16.009 --> 06:17.077
CAN I FINISH, PLEASE?

06:17.077 --> 06:19.680
I NEED THAT MARTINSON
DEPOSITION ON MY DESK

06:19.680 --> 06:21.148
BY 9:00
TOMORROW MORNING.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.416
AND CALL MY WIFE.

06:22.416 --> 06:25.085
TELL HER I CAN'T
MAKE DINNER AT 7:30.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.957
TELL HER TO CALL THE WHOOZITS
AND MAKE IT 8:30.

06:29.957 --> 06:30.824
YES, SIR.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.826
BECAUSE
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.828
AND IF YOU CAN'T LEARN

06:34.828 --> 06:36.830
TO RESPECT
OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS,

06:36.830 --> 06:38.766
WE'LL HAVE
A BIG PROBLEM.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.002
YOU'RE NOT TO LEAVE
THIS ROOM TONIGHT.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.837
YOU UNDERSTAND?

06:48.609 --> 06:51.812
THE SOONER WE GET THERE,
THE SOONER WE LEAVE.

06:51.812 --> 06:52.813
YOU READY?

06:52.813 --> 06:53.647
MM-HMM.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.082

WE'RE GOING NOW.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.450
GOOD NIGHT, MISSUS.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.460
KEYS?

07:07.327 --> 07:08.829
GOT THEM.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.498
I CAN'T.

07:10.498 --> 07:13.501
NEXT WEEK, ALL OF OUR RELATIVES
ARE COMING IN.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.503
GEORGE, YOU SHOULD
GET A BOAT.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.905
AND JUST SEND THEM AWAY?
I LIKE THAT.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.107
LAST YEAR, WHEN SARAH'S
RELATIVES CAME,

07:20.107 --> 07:21.374
WE CHARTERED
THIS BOAT.

07:21.374 --> 07:22.643
OH, GOD, THE BOAT.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.645
YOU TAKE THEM OUT,
FEED THEM,

07:24.645 --> 07:26.914
THEY STARE AT THE
STATUE OF LIBERTY.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.549
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY,
AND NOBODY TALKS.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.584
THEY DON'T REALIZE
THEY'RE NOT TALKING.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.853
I ONLY CAME BECAUSE
IT SAID TWO.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.454
IN THE PAPER?
TWO FIREPLACES.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.856
SO, FINALLY,
I GET THERE,

07:35.856 --> 07:37.858
AND SHE SAYS,
"NO, THAT'S WRONG,

07:37.858 --> 07:41.061
BUT IT'S GOT
TWO FIRE ESCAPES."

MR. TURNER.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.676

08:28.676 --> 08:31.178
YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE
TO RACHEL.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.780
I DON'T WANT YOU DEALING
WITH TRACY ANYMORE.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.349

THIS TABLE, THAT'S IT.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.885

08:37.885 --> 08:40.087

YOU'RE SORRY.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.554

08:41.554 --> 08:44.658
DID YOU TELL THE CATERER
WE'RE 60 NOW?

08:51.899 --> 08:53.100

VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

HOW WOULD YOU REACT

09:39.579 --> 09:42.315
IF I SPILLED GRAPE JUICE
ON YOUR BABY?

09:43.550 --> 09:47.287

BE RESPONSIBLE,

30:38.537 --> 30:42.909
THE WORK THEY DO AT LAWRENCE
IS JUST INSPIRING.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.776
HENRY'S DOING WONDERFULLY.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.445
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
YOUR EYES.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.315
I KNEW HE'D SET RECORDS
FOR RECOVERY.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.517
YOU'D BE VERY
PROUD OF HIM.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.885
HE'S WORKING HARD.

30:52.885 --> 30:55.454
WORKING HARD? HENRY?
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

30:55.454 --> 30:58.324
EVERY DAY I'M THERE,
IT JUST AMAZES ME.

30:58.324 --> 30:59.926
HE'S LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU.

30:59.926 --> 31:01.360
I SECOND THAT.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.628
THANK YOU.

31:02.628 --> 31:03.963
I WANTED TO ASK--

31:03.963 --> 31:06.632
NOW DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY, DARLING--

31:06.632 --> 31:08.434
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

31:08.434 --> 31:11.037
THAT...THINGS
ARE UNDER CONTROL,

31:11.037 --> 31:13.039
THAT YOU'RE OK.

31:13.039 --> 31:17.176
WELL, CONSIDERING,
I'M PERFECT.

31:17.176 --> 31:20.446
I REALLY DO THINK
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OK.

31:20.446 --> 31:23.782
IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME
TO GET BACK TO NORMAL,

31:23.782 --> 31:25.184
BUT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.853
I MEAN FINANCIALLY.

31:27.853 --> 31:28.955
OH.

31:28.955 --> 31:30.322
I HATE TO LEAVE YOU
WITH THE BILL,

31:30.322 --> 31:32.191
BUT YOU'D BE PAYING,
ANYWAY, RIGHT?

31:32.191 --> 31:34.660
GOT TO GET TO COURT.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, SARAH.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.662
THANK YOU.

31:36.662 --> 31:37.964
I KNOW THIS IS AWKWARD.

31:37.964 --> 31:40.066
SOME THINGS WE JUST
DON'T TALK ABOUT,

31:40.066 --> 31:44.070
BUT YOU AND HENRY ARE FAMILY.
YOU KNOW THAT.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.072
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

31:46.072 --> 31:48.240
BECAUSE IF YOU
NEED HELP--ANYTHING,

31:48.240 --> 31:49.275
I'M PREPARED TO--

31:49.275 --> 31:51.677

WONDERFUL SHAPE.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.412

31:56.348 --> 31:59.485
I KNEW I COULD
COUNT ON HENRY.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.621
ALL RIGHT,
MY MAN.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.756
YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS?

32:04.756 --> 32:07.026
IT'S CALLED
A WALKER.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.827
WALKER.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.229
YEAH,
BUT THAT'S BULLSHIT,

32:10.229 --> 32:12.898
'CAUSE YOU'RE DOING
ALL THE WALKING.

32:12.898 --> 32:14.800
NOW, LET'S SEE

32:14.800 --> 32:16.635
IF WE CAN GET YOU
STANDING UP, HUH?

32:16.635 --> 32:18.370
SCOOT UP
A LITTLE BIT.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.505
GOOD. OK.

32:19.505 --> 32:20.339
SIT TALL.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.908

ARMS AND YOUR LEGS.

32:26.912 --> 32:28.247

WORRY ABOUT IT.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.519
GOOD. VERY GOOD.

32:33.519 --> 32:34.753
HOW'S THAT FEEL?

32:34.753 --> 32:36.455
I DON'T KNOW.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.191
THAT UPPER BODY WORK'S
READY TO PAY OFF.

32:39.191 --> 32:42.461
PUT YOUR RIGHT HAND
ON THE WALKER.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.264
GOOD. GOOD.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.598

35:16.315 --> 35:18.917
THERE'S HIS WIFE
DOIN' ANOTHER MAN.

35:18.917 --> 35:21.787

36:35.961 --> 36:37.629
LOOKS GREAT.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.400
BUT YOU'RE
NOT PACKED.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.969
WHY AREN'T
YOU PACKED?

36:43.969 --> 36:45.237
UM...

36:45.237 --> 36:46.905
I'M NOT GOING.

36:56.515 --> 36:59.117
REMEMBER WHAT
DR. MARX TOLD YOU?

36:59.117 --> 37:01.119
REMEMBER WHEN
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS

37:01.119 --> 37:02.888
A COUPLE
OF DAYS AGO?

37:02.888 --> 37:04.990
YEAH. I--

37:04.990 --> 37:06.925
I CHANGED MY MIND.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.594
I'M GOING TO STAY.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.028
YOUR WIFE
AND DAUGHTER

37:10.028 --> 37:11.196
ARE COMING
TO PICK YOU UP.

37:11.196 --> 37:12.664
YOU'RE GOING HOME.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.333
BUT...

37:14.333 --> 37:16.201
I LIVE HERE.

37:16.201 --> 37:19.070
NO, MAN.
THIS IS A PIT STOP.

37:19.070 --> 37:22.007
I HEAR YOU GOT
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.944
BUT...YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE THERE.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.479
NO.

37:27.479 --> 37:29.948
NO. I GOT TO
HANG HERE,

37:29.948 --> 37:32.017
BUT YOU GOT
YOUR FAMILY.

37:33.218 --> 37:34.520
BUT...

37:36.288 --> 37:38.357
I--I--

37:38.357 --> 37:40.359
I DON'T KNOW THEM.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.727
I DON'T.

37:41.727 --> 37:42.728
THEY LOVE YOU.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.195
THEY'RE GOING TO
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.365
WELL, I DON'T WANT THEM
TO TAKE CARE OF ME, BRADLEY!

37:46.365 --> 37:47.966
I DON'T!
NO. STOP IT!

37:47.966 --> 37:48.967
HANK, LISTEN.

37:48.967 --> 37:49.868
LEAVE ME ALONE,
BRADLEY.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.571
HANK, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE FINE.

37:52.571 --> 37:55.374
YOU GOT TO
GO BACK SOMETIME.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.613
I JUST...

38:02.614 --> 38:05.684
I JUST
C-CAN'T REMEMBER.

38:05.684 --> 38:08.019
I DON'T KNOW
THOSE PEOPLE.

38:23.101 --> 38:24.770
I'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE.

38:28.707 --> 38:29.708
HI, SARAH.

38:29.708 --> 38:30.509
HI.

38:30.509 --> 38:31.977
HOW YOU

38:31.977 --> 38:33.111

38:33.111 --> 38:34.846
HI, HENRY.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.882
HI, DAD.

38:39.718 --> 38:40.786
HI.

38:47.826 --> 38:51.262
WE THINK IT'S TIME
YOU COME HOME.

38:51.262 --> 38:53.532
YEAH. UH, HE TOLD ME.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.801
BRADLEY TOLD ME.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.736
IS THAT OK?

38:57.736 --> 38:59.738
DO YOU WANT
TO COME HOME?

39:01.940 --> 39:03.875
WHAT ABOUT BRADLEY?

39:04.810 --> 39:07.345
BRADLEY CAN TAKE
CARE OF HIMSELF,

39:07.345 --> 39:09.815
AND YOU'VE GOT US...

39:09.815 --> 39:11.583
AND WE'RE
GOING TO HELP YOU

39:11.583 --> 39:14.520
IN EVERY WAY WE CAN.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.889
YOU'VE GOT A LIFE
BACK AT HOME,

39:17.889 --> 39:20.358
A LIFE WITH
FRIENDS AND FAMILY

39:20.358 --> 39:23.094
AND EVERYTHING
YOU COULD EVER WANT.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.262
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

39:24.262 --> 39:25.897
IS SAY YOU WANT
TO COME HOME,

39:25.897 --> 39:27.365
THAT'S ALL.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.900
IT'S EASY.

39:33.238 --> 39:35.106
I DON'T WANT TO.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.783
WE ALREADY
DISCUSSED THIS.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.652
I THINK IT MAY
BE PREMATURE

39:46.652 --> 39:47.719
FOR HENRY
TO GO HOME.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.721
I THINK HE SHOULD
WANT TO FIRST.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.524
I JUST WANT WHAT'S BEST.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.005
HI.

40:07.005 --> 40:09.007
I'M BRADLEY.

40:17.148 --> 40:20.151
HE'S NOT MAD AT YOU.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.553
HEY...

40:21.553 --> 40:24.823
WHY DON'T YOU GO
AND TALK TO HIM?

41:10.001 --> 41:12.137
BIG LOOP...

41:12.137 --> 41:13.539
LITTLE LOOP,

41:13.539 --> 41:15.273
CROSS OVER,

41:15.273 --> 41:16.842
PULL THROUGH.

41:20.278 --> 41:23.214
H-HOW DID YOU LEARN
TO DO THAT?

41:23.214 --> 41:25.551
YOU TAUGHT ME.

41:27.686 --> 41:29.688
THERE WAS GRAY CARPET.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.792
I REMEMBER GRAY CARPET.

41:36.427 --> 41:38.296
WHERE WAS THAT?

41:38.296 --> 41:40.766
THAT WAS HOME.

41:46.805 --> 41:49.675
I REMEMBER GRAY CARPET.

41:49.675 --> 41:51.977
I WANT TO GO HOME.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.282
OK, HONEY?
COME ON, RACHEL.

42:03.922 --> 42:06.024
HENRY?

42:06.024 --> 42:07.225
COME ON.

42:10.295 --> 42:11.429

42:11.429 --> 42:13.164

MAN.

42:13.164 --> 42:14.232

WHEN YOU GET HOME,

42:15.567 --> 42:16.735

42:16.735 --> 42:18.837
AND THINK OF YOUR
FRIEND BRADLEY.

42:18.837 --> 42:20.572
AM I GOING TO SEE YOU?

42:20.572 --> 42:21.573
YEAH.

42:21.573 --> 42:22.574

01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:04.568
IT'S--IT'S JUST
A LITTLE FRAME.

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:05.636
OK.

01:00:05.636 --> 01:00:07.004
THANKS.

01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:11.208
"WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITH HIM?"

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:12.509
HENRY'S DAD SAID.

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:15.746
"I'VE GROUNDED HIM, BUT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO."

01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:17.614
I SAID, "ARE YOU KIDDING?

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:20.885
I WANT THAT BOY
IN THE FIRM."

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:25.756
AND AS IT TURNED OUT,
IT WAS THE BEST DECISION

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:27.624
I EVER MADE.

01:00:28.759 --> 01:00:31.028
FOR YEARS,
THE HALLS OF OUR FIRM

01:00:31.028 --> 01:00:34.164
HAVE RESOUNDED WITH
THE CALL OF HENRY TURNER,

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:36.600
THROWING ON HIS JACKET,
STRIDING THROUGH THE OFFICE,

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.768
CRYING, "COME ON, GUYS,

01:00:37.768 --> 01:00:40.104
LET'S GO OUT
AND BREAK SOME BALLS."

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:43.774
I OFFER A TOAST
TO THE YEARS TO COME,

01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:46.744
WHEN ONCE MORE, WE WILL HEAR
THAT FAMILIAR CRY.

01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:48.012
TO HENRY.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.749
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:03.527
S-S-SARAH...

01:01:03.527 --> 01:01:06.530
S-S-SAID I
SHOULD SAY SOMETHING.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.799
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:13.203
UH, I DON'T REMEMBER
ANY OF YOU.

01:01:14.739 --> 01:01:17.541
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER...

01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:20.544
VERY MUCH OF--OF ANYTHING.

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:22.747
UM...

01:01:22.747 --> 01:01:26.016
UH, IT'S ALL MIXED UP.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:26.984
UM...

01:01:26.984 --> 01:01:30.154
LIKE, I REMEMBER...

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:31.021
UM...

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:33.357
THAT RACHEL
LIKES STRAWBERRIES

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:35.359
ON HER PANCAKES,

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:38.095
BUT I DON'T...

01:01:38.095 --> 01:01:39.363
REMEMBER...

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:41.365
ANY OF HER BIRTHDAY PARTIES,

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:44.769
ALTHOUGH I SAW PICTURES,
AND I WAS THERE.

01:01:44.769 --> 01:01:47.237
UM...

01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:48.238
I...

01:01:48.238 --> 01:01:52.642
I REMEM-REMEMBER
A WOMAN IN A BLUE DRESS

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:54.444
STANDING ON GRASS.

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:55.780
UH...

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:56.914
UM...

01:01:56.914 --> 01:01:58.783
I THINK THAT'S MY MOTHER,

01:01:58.783 --> 01:02:01.786
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S MY MOTHER.

01:02:01.786 --> 01:02:03.220
UM...

01:02:06.791 --> 01:02:09.393
SO IF YOU'LL
JUST BE PATIENT,

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:11.328
I'LL--I'M...

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:13.030
I'M TRYING.

01:02:14.865 --> 01:02:17.001
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:30.881
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE OF ME
AS A BABY.

01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:37.487
W-WHO'S THIS?

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:38.688
YOU.

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:41.158
YOUR FATHER USED
TO MAKE YOU MOW THE LAWN

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:43.994
AND TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE
AND WALK THE DOG

01:02:43.994 --> 01:02:45.362
AND WASH THE CAR,

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:48.765
AND THEN YOU LEARNED
TO APPRECIATE THE WORK ETHIC.

01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:51.301
WHAT'S THAT?

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:53.370
I DON'T KNOW.

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:26.203
BIKE.

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.075
HI, HENRY.
HI.

01:03:31.075 --> 01:03:31.876
HI.

01:03:31.876 --> 01:03:32.877
HELLO.

01:03:32.877 --> 01:03:34.478
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.080
OH, THANK YOU. HI.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.081
HI.

01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:38.115
HI.

01:03:38.115 --> 01:03:39.183
HELLO.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:41.185
HI.

01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:43.387
IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU BACK.

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:44.388
THANK YOU.

01:03:44.388 --> 01:03:45.689
HI.

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:46.690
HELLO.

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:47.691
HI.

01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:49.293
WELCOME BACK,
MR. TURNER.

01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:50.527
OH, THANK YOU.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:54.798
HENRY, HELLO. I'M RUDY.

01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:56.200
RU-DY.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.937
I JUST WANT TO SAY HELLO
AND WELCOME BACK.

01:04:01.205 --> 01:04:02.806
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:04.408
HE'S AN ASSHOLE.

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:05.409
OH.

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:06.410
HENRY.

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:07.411
HI.

01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:08.412
IT'S LINDA.

01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:09.513
HI, LINDA.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.982
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
BACK AT THE OFFICE.

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:15.252
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, TOO...

01:04:15.252 --> 01:04:16.320
LINDA.

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:21.491
THIS IS YOUR OFFICE.

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:27.831
AND THIS IS...

01:04:27.831 --> 01:04:28.966
JESSICA.

01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:30.834
JESSICA. SHE WAS
YOUR SECRETARY,

01:04:30.834 --> 01:04:33.103
AND SHE WAS WORKING
FOR STEVEN

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:34.972
WHILE YOU WERE AWAY.

01:04:34.972 --> 01:04:36.573
NICE FLOWER.

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.077
THANK YOU.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:42.546
WOW.

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:53.890
I'M AT THE END OF THE HALL
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.460
OK. WELL,
I'LL BE IN HERE

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:57.794
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

01:04:57.794 --> 01:04:59.829
LET'S GRAB LUNCH
THIS WEEK.

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:00.830
OK.

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:02.766
HE'S BACK.

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:04.468
GRAB LUNCH.

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:06.070
GRAB LUNCH.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:07.437
GRAB LUNCH.

01:05:15.779 --> 01:05:17.114
"MATTHEWS...

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:21.185
V. EAST SHORE
H-H-HOSPITAL."

01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:28.592
SAY WHEN.

01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:39.103
WHEN YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH,
MR. TURNER,

01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:40.637
YOU SAY, "WHEN."

01:05:41.972 --> 01:05:44.641
OH. WHEN.

01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:57.521
YOU WANT ANYTHING
FROM THE KITCHEN?

01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:00.624
THANKS. I'M OK.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.695
A LITTLE MILK
AND COOKIES?

01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:08.398
MALLOMARS?

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:11.935
UH, NO. I JUST--I HAVE
TO FINISH READING THIS.

01:06:11.935 --> 01:06:14.971
YOU DON'T REMEMBER
MALLOMARS, DO YOU?

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.207
NO.

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:19.509
MARSHMALLOWS IN CHOCOLATE?

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:23.713
I ONCE WATCHED YOU
EAT A WHOLE PACKAGE

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:24.881
IN 3 1/2 MINUTES.

01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:28.052
OK. I'LL HAVE
SOME MALLOMARS.

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:32.456
BUDDY...

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:33.757
SIT.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:42.999
SO WE PUSH FOR OCTOBER.
WE CAN GO TO TRIAL THEN.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.734
WHAT ABOUT LAWSON?

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.870
HE'S ON THE BARNES CASE.

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:47.871
HOW LONG?

01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:49.473
LAWSON? TRY A DECADE.

01:06:49.473 --> 01:06:50.674
WHAT DID HE SAY?

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:53.143
NOTHING HELPFUL.
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE A CHOICE.

01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:54.544
WHAT?
DO WE POSTPONE?

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:57.147
WE CAN'T PUSH THIS
OFF FOREVER.

01:06:57.147 --> 01:06:59.516
EITHER WE GET IT,
OR WE DON'T.

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:00.950
IF WE LOSE ROGERS,

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:03.287
HALF A DOZEN OTHER
CLIENTS WILL FOLLOW.

01:07:03.287 --> 01:07:05.422
WE CAN'T LOSE HIS CASE
BECAUSE OF BARNES.

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:08.292
SO WE GO SEPTEMBER
WITH ANOTHER WITNESS.

01:07:08.292 --> 01:07:10.160
WE'LL PULL
A HENRY TURNER.

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:15.465
IT'S REALLY DECENT OF YOU

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:18.368
TO LET HENRY
COME BACK LIKE THIS.

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:21.771
WELL, AFTER ALL,
WE'RE HUMAN, AREN'T WE?

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:24.108
UM, IS--IS THERE
MORE, UM...

01:07:24.108 --> 01:07:27.444
ON MATTHEWS VS.
EAST SHORE HOSPITAL?

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:30.647
THAT WOULD BE
IN THE FILE ROOM.

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.782
I'LL GET THE FILE.

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:34.084
OK. I'LL WAIT HERE.

01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:35.252
UH...

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:38.188
YOU CAN WAIT
IN YOUR OFFICE.

01:07:38.188 --> 01:07:40.190
I'LL BRING IT TO YOU.

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:42.058
OK. I'LL WAIT
IN MY OFFICE.

01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:46.563
HE'S GOING
TO PAUL WEISS?

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:49.266
MONTGOMERY OFFERED HIM
650 AND A PARTNERSHIP.

01:07:49.266 --> 01:07:50.867
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

01:07:50.867 --> 01:07:52.869
I'D HAVE TO
SEE THE OFFICE.

01:07:52.869 --> 01:07:53.870
OH, YEAH.

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:55.472
WELCOME BACK,
MR. TURNER.

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:56.273
OH, HI.

01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:57.874
I'VE GOT THIS QUESTION.

01:07:57.874 --> 01:07:59.476
WHAT IS IT?

01:07:59.476 --> 01:08:00.877
UM, UH...

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:02.279
IN THIS CASE...

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:03.880
UH, WHICH ONE?

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.282
M-M-MATTHEWS.

01:08:05.282 --> 01:08:06.883
EAST SHORE
HOSPITAL--

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:08.285
YOUR FAMOUS
LAST CASE.

01:08:08.285 --> 01:08:09.686
YEAH. YEAH. WE SAID

01:08:09.686 --> 01:08:11.621
THAT THE HOSPITAL
WASN'T RESPONSIBLE

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:14.224
BECAUSE MR. MATTHEWS
DIDN'T TELL THEM

01:08:14.224 --> 01:08:15.825
HE WAS A DIABETIC.

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:17.093
THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.495
THE HOSPITAL
WASN'T RESPONSIBLE

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:21.231
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW
THE GUY WAS ON INSULIN.

01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:24.634
YEAH, BUT LOOK.
IN THIS FILE, UM...

01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:27.237
THIS OTHER PATIENT,
UM, MISS MacNAIR,

01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:30.240
UH, SAID THAT SHE HEARD
MR. MATTHEWS, UH...

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.642
TELL THE NURSE
HE WAS DIABETIC,

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:34.644
BUT SHE DIDN'T
WRITE IT DOWN.

01:08:34.644 --> 01:08:37.680
UM, SO, WE'RE--WE'RE SAYING
THEY'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE,

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.283
BUT--BUT WE
DIDN'T TELL THEM

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:41.984
ABOUT THIS LADY'S STATEMENT.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:42.986
SO WHAT?

01:08:42.986 --> 01:08:45.255
COME ON, HENRY.
PUT IT AWAY.

01:08:45.255 --> 01:08:47.122
PUT IT BACK
IN THE FILE.

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:50.126
BUT, SO, UM...

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:55.165
WHAT WE DID WAS WRONG.

01:08:55.165 --> 01:08:59.269
WHAT WE DID IS PAYING
FOR OUR LUNCH.

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:03.707
SO EVERYTHING'S OK?

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:05.341
STILL LOVE ME?

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:07.411
YEAH. WHEN ARE YOU
COMING HOME?

01:09:07.411 --> 01:09:10.247
UH, I'LL BE HOME
BY DINNER.

01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:12.148
DON'T SPOIL
YOUR APPETITE.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:14.551
OK. YOU, TOO.
BYE-BYE.

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:17.854
"MIX UNTIL...

01:09:17.854 --> 01:09:19.856
"CREAMY.

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:22.725
"DROP SPOONFULS...

"ON...

GREAS-ED COOKIE SHEET."

01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:30.267
LET'S MAKE
ONE BIG COOKIE.

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:32.736
YOU CAN'T.
IT DOESN'T COOK.

01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:34.136
I TRIED IT ONCE.

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:35.404
OH.

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.716
WERE YOU SCARED
AT THE HOSPITAL?

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:49.886
AT FIRST.

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:50.886
YEAH.

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:53.290
BUT THEN IT GOT OK,
RIGHT?

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:56.693
YEAH. THEN IT GOT OK.

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:58.895
'CAUSE I START
SCHOOL SOON.

01:23:44.087 --> 01:23:45.488
HE WAS THE BEST.

01:23:45.488 --> 01:23:47.356
EVERYBODY
WAS TERRIFIED OF HIM.

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.692
OF COURSE,
I'VE KNOWN SARAH FOREVER.

01:23:49.692 --> 01:23:51.094
HE'S BACK
AT WORK.

01:23:51.094 --> 01:23:52.228
DOING WHAT?

01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:54.097
GETTING PAID
FOR DOING NOTHING

01:23:54.097 --> 01:23:55.498
DOESN'T SOUND
SO BAD.

01:23:55.498 --> 01:23:58.234
IT'S NOT HENRY
I FEEL SORRY FOR.

01:23:58.234 --> 01:23:59.368
IT'S SARAH.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:01.237
SHE'S GOT
TWO KIDS NOW.

01:24:01.237 --> 01:24:03.506
WHAT CAN SHE POSSIBLY
LOOK FORWARD TO?

01:24:03.506 --> 01:24:05.274
ONE MINUTE,
YOU'RE AN ATTORNEY.

01:24:05.274 --> 01:24:07.243
THE NEXT,
YOU'RE AN IMBECILE.

01:24:07.243 --> 01:24:09.778

A VERY LONG TRIP.

01:24:17.253 --> 01:24:20.856
I AM AFRAID WE, UH...
WE CAN'T STAY FOR DINNER.

01:24:20.856 --> 01:24:23.459
I WANTED

01:24:56.492 --> 01:24:57.793

01:24:59.295 --> 01:25:02.165

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:35.564

SOMEONE OVER.

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:43.906
BRADLEY.

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:53.482
OH, DINNER.

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:54.750
THANKS.

01:26:07.196 --> 01:26:09.832
SO, WHAT'S UP?

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:18.140
I THOUGHT I COULD
GO BACK TO MY LIFE,

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:23.111
BUT...I DON'T LIKE
WHO I WAS, BRADLEY.

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:26.449
I--I DON'T FIT IN.

01:26:32.655 --> 01:26:34.923
I GOT BAD KNEES.

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:36.392
WHAT?

01:26:36.392 --> 01:26:38.026
MY KNEES,
THEY'RE BAD.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.695
ASK ME WHY.

01:26:41.163 --> 01:26:42.298
WHY?

01:26:42.298 --> 01:26:44.032
FOOTBALL.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:45.301
WRECKED THEM BOTH

01:26:45.301 --> 01:26:48.170
PLAYING
COLLEGE FOOTBALL.

01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:50.172
MAN, IT WAS MY LIFE.

01:26:50.172 --> 01:26:52.040

WHAT ELSE WAS THERE?

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:55.778
NOT JACK SHIT.

01:26:55.778 --> 01:26:57.313
HOMECOMING, RIGHT?

01:26:57.313 --> 01:27:00.783
THAT SON OF A BITCH
THREW A PERFECT SPIRAL,

01:27:00.783 --> 01:27:02.184
AND I CAUGHT IT.

01:27:02.184 --> 01:27:03.319
BOOM.

01:27:03.319 --> 01:27:05.321
RIGHT OUT
OF THE SKY.

01:27:05.321 --> 01:27:08.324
I HAD THE MOMENT.

01:27:08.324 --> 01:27:10.526
WHEN THAT
SAFETY HIT ME

01:27:10.526 --> 01:27:13.128
AND I FELT
MY KNEES POP,

01:27:13.128 --> 01:27:15.130
I KNEW THAT WAS IT.

01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:16.865
GAME OVER.
FORGET IT.

01:27:16.865 --> 01:27:18.967
I WAS DEAD.

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:21.537
MY LIFE WAS OVER,
HANK.

01:27:23.539 --> 01:27:27.410
NOW ASK ME IF I MIND
HAVING BAD KNEES.

01:27:28.877 --> 01:27:30.279
DO YOU MIND--

01:27:30.279 --> 01:27:31.580
NO.

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.048
NO WAY.

01:27:33.048 --> 01:27:35.618
IT WAS A TEST.

01:27:35.618 --> 01:27:38.554
I HAD
TO FIND A LIFE.

01:27:40.289 --> 01:27:43.025
THE THERAPIST THAT
HELPED ME WALK AGAIN,

01:27:43.025 --> 01:27:44.427
HE WAS SO COOL.

01:27:44.427 --> 01:27:45.561
I THOUGHT...

01:27:45.561 --> 01:27:48.030
"THAT'S WHAT
I WANT TO DO."

01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:50.566
WHEN I TOLD SOME
OF MY BUDDIES,

01:27:50.566 --> 01:27:52.401
THEY LAUGHED
IN MY FACE.

01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:53.702
CALLED ME A NURSE,

01:27:53.702 --> 01:27:56.305
BOUGHT ME WHITE
DRESSES AND SHIT.

01:27:56.305 --> 01:27:58.273
BUT CHECK IT OUT.

01:27:59.908 --> 01:28:01.877
YOU'RE WALKING.

01:28:01.877 --> 01:28:03.312

YOU'RE SITTING HERE

01:28:04.447 --> 01:28:06.315
DRINKING SOME PRETTY
EXPENSIVE BEER.

01:28:06.315 --> 01:28:08.584
I HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

01:28:08.584 --> 01:28:11.153
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR MY KNEES,

01:28:11.153 --> 01:28:13.155
I'D NEVER
HAVE MET YOU.

01:28:13.155 --> 01:28:14.323
SO, NO,

01:28:14.323 --> 01:28:17.292
I DON'T MIND HAVING
BAD KNEES. NO.

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:20.363

SOMETHING, HANK.

01:28:20.363 --> 01:28:21.830

IT'S AN EMERGENCY,

SOUNDS SO SAD.

I COULD--
