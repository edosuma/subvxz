00:45.969 --> 00:48.009
Hoist the main sail!

00:48.009 --> 00:50.989
Aye, aye, Captain.
There's a fair wind blowing.

00:50.989 --> 00:52.749
They'll not catch us now.

00:52.749 --> 00:57.369
There's treasure beyond your
wildest dreams on Skeleton Island.

00:57.369 --> 00:59.969
My lord, it's hot an oven today,
Mrs Brackenreid.

00:59.969 --> 01:02.009
I hear it may go
as high as 98 degrees.

01:02.009 --> 01:05.369
Hotter here than in the city
of Los Angeles, California.

01:07.109 --> 01:08.269
Waves are blowing in.

01:08.269 --> 01:12.409
Your son's a fine young boy.
Kind of you to say, Miss Williams.

01:12.409 --> 01:17.049
Can I wear your hat? It's my turn
to be John Silver. Aye, Captain.

01:17.049 --> 01:18.309
My husband says Bobby

01:18.309 --> 01:21.689
lives in a dream cloud.
And he's not far wrong.

01:21.689 --> 01:24.289
It's their time for dreams.
That ends soon enough.

01:25.169 --> 01:26.129
Captain.

01:31.909 --> 01:33.129
Land ahoy!

01:40.209 --> 01:42.289
Help! Help me!

01:42.289 --> 01:45.649
Someone! Hurry!
Whatever's that?

01:45.649 --> 01:48.009
Help me! Someone! Hurry!

01:55.709 --> 01:57.089
Looks like we're on our own.

01:58.349 --> 01:59.949
That's all right.

01:59.949 --> 02:02.549
Pirates can do anything alone.

02:02.549 --> 02:05.069
What happened? My wages!

02:05.069 --> 02:07.849
He's got my wages.
My goodness, are you all right?

02:07.849 --> 02:11.489
A man stole my purse!
Which way did he go?

02:11.489 --> 02:15.769
That way, I think. What am I to do?

02:15.769 --> 02:18.569
There, there, dear.
Would you recognize the culprit?

02:18.569 --> 02:20.009
I think so.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.449
Then you must report this.

02:21.449 --> 02:24.709
The sooner you do, the better
chance of recovering your wages.

02:24.709 --> 02:27.689
I'll tell the first constable I see.
All right.

02:34.389 --> 02:38.209
What a terrible thing to happen.
You see it more and more these days.

02:38.209 --> 02:41.069
It's not fair, Miss Williams!
It's not fair.

02:41.069 --> 02:44.649
Robert, what's not fair? Why can't
I go on the adventure like Bobby?

02:44.649 --> 02:47.829
What adventure is that?
The man said only Bobby could go.

02:47.829 --> 02:50.989
The man? What man? Bobby?!

02:50.989 --> 02:53.689
Bobby?! Bobby!

02:54.709 --> 02:56.769
Bobby! Bobby!

02:59.089 --> 03:00.069
Bobby!

03:05.429 --> 03:08.589
Thomas! Thomas, come quickly!
Margaret? What's happened?

03:08.589 --> 03:12.489
Bobby's gone. What do you mean
"gone"? He's been taken.

03:12.489 --> 03:13.669
Murdoch!

03:26.449 --> 03:28.209
Nothing. Bloody nothing.

03:28.209 --> 03:31.769
Sir, it occurs to me, not knowing
the motive for the abduction,

03:31.769 --> 03:33.569
concerns arise for your other boy.

03:33.569 --> 03:38.489
I appreciate that, Murdoch.
Fortunately John's staying in
Grimsby with Margaret's sister.

03:38.489 --> 03:42.089
Very good, sir.
A crime scene as dry as a desert
and not a clue to be found.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.649
Then we must rely on what we know.

03:44.649 --> 03:49.289
Mrs Brackenreid and the other
boy's nanny were sitting here.

03:49.289 --> 03:51.409
No passers-by in the vicinity.

03:51.409 --> 03:54.529
Then the victim of
the purse-snatching cried out.

03:58.889 --> 04:02.669
The young woman was assaulted
by the purse-snatcher here.

04:02.669 --> 04:06.309
The sight lines to where the
boys were playing are poor.

04:06.309 --> 04:09.069
This thief clips a passer-by,
causing a commotion...

04:09.069 --> 04:11.589
Exactly, while a second man...
Grabs my son.

04:11.589 --> 04:17.928
One crime disguised as two.
At least a possibility. Sirs, this
was found in the bushes yonder.

04:17.928 --> 04:20.249
The thief has relieved the girl
of her money.

04:20.249 --> 04:22.609
The young woman who was assaulted?

04:22.609 --> 04:26.769
Miss Evie Dewar. She hailed
Constable Hoover on Carlton St.
Given a statement.

04:26.769 --> 04:29.369
I'll need her to look
at some photographs.

04:29.369 --> 04:32.929
Yes, sir. We'll need to talk to
the nanny and the Stanton boy.

04:32.929 --> 04:36.929
Sir, that is Stanton
as in Stanton Breweries, is it not?

04:39.249 --> 04:41.609
Are you all right, sir?

04:41.609 --> 04:43.129
What? Let's get on with it.

04:48.529 --> 04:50.469
A young boy taken in broad daylight?

04:50.469 --> 04:55.149
This city's going to the dogs. My
sympathies, Inspector Brackenreid.

04:55.149 --> 04:57.349
Much appreciated, Mr Stanton.

04:57.349 --> 04:59.189
Now, is your boy's nanny about?

04:59.189 --> 05:01.049
I assumed you'd be stopping in.

05:01.049 --> 05:03.649
She has instructions
to speak freely with you.

05:03.649 --> 05:07.929
We'll need to speak with
your boy, Robert, as well, sir.
My wife will arrange that.

05:07.929 --> 05:12.429
You sent for me, sir?
See the officers to the sitting
room, Lucy. Right away, sir.

05:12.429 --> 05:15.209
Commiserations aside, gentlemen,
business awaits.

05:20.069 --> 05:23.889
Nothing unusual, Inspector.
We were commenting on the heat,

05:23.889 --> 05:27.669
watching the young boys play,
then we heard
the young woman call for help.

05:27.669 --> 05:31.249
Did you see the purse snatcher,
Miss Williams? I'm sorry, no.

05:32.289 --> 05:34.849
Do Bobby and Robert usually
play together at the fort?

05:36.389 --> 05:39.209
The wife says it's pirates,
morning, noon and night.

05:39.209 --> 05:42.309
He's right. Robert is
fascinated with Treasure Island.

05:44.409 --> 05:45.909
Thank you, Miss Williams.

05:45.909 --> 05:47.789
Mrs Stanton, I presume?

05:47.789 --> 05:50.729
Inspector Brackenreid.
Detective Murdoch.

05:50.729 --> 05:53.209
This is so worrying.

05:53.209 --> 05:54.889
How are you faring, Inspector?

05:56.349 --> 05:57.729
Fine.

05:57.729 --> 05:59.669
And you must be Master Robert.

05:59.669 --> 06:01.529
Are you a real policeman?

06:03.589 --> 06:07.289
Yes, I am. And I need your help
to find Bobby. Yes, sir.

06:11.829 --> 06:15.849
Robert, what do you remember
about what happened in the park?

06:15.849 --> 06:18.669
A man came over to us.
Did he talk to you?

06:18.669 --> 06:21.329
It's all right, Robert.

06:21.329 --> 06:24.589
He wanted to take Bobby on an
adventure with real pirates.

06:24.589 --> 06:26.189
He said I could go next time.

06:26.189 --> 06:30.009
Did he hurt Bobby?
No, sir. What did he look like?

06:30.009 --> 06:31.889
He had a big hat.

06:31.889 --> 06:34.969
Was he old or young? Old. Like you.

06:34.969 --> 06:37.649
Did he sport a beard or moustache?

06:37.649 --> 06:40.209
Glasses, perhaps? No, sir.

06:40.209 --> 06:42.009
You've done very well, Robert.

06:42.009 --> 06:45.889
There's a policeman coming by to help
you make a picture of him. Yes, sir.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.689
Time for lunch, Master Robert.
Thank you, Lucy.

06:51.889 --> 06:55.089
Please pass on my sincere
thoughts to Mrs Brackenreid.

06:55.089 --> 06:57.589
I'll be sure to.

06:57.589 --> 07:00.569
This must be such a
terrible time for you.

07:02.669 --> 07:05.849
I never thought
I would have a child.

07:05.849 --> 07:09.269
The day Robert came into
our lives was a miracle.

07:09.269 --> 07:10.969
The very thought of losing him...

07:12.049 --> 07:13.049
Yes, madam.

07:31.049 --> 07:34.509
Bobby's disappearance
was a planned abduction.

07:34.509 --> 07:39.329
One man could have carried out both
crimes, snatching the purse here,

07:39.329 --> 07:42.029
Then running through the woods
to the boys' fort.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.749
It's a distance,
but it could be done.

07:44.749 --> 07:47.729
We're more likely looking
for two men working together.

07:47.729 --> 07:51.989
I've arranged for Miss Dewar
to look at police photographs
for possible suspects.

07:51.989 --> 07:53.929
Young Stanton's portrait?

07:53.929 --> 07:58.089
Our sketch artist got
an excellent likeness, but
only of the kidnapper's hat.

07:58.089 --> 08:00.269
You being funny, Crabtree?

08:00.269 --> 08:01.429
No, sir.

08:01.429 --> 08:06.489
What do you think, Murdoch?
I've been in this job enough years
to have a few enemies.

08:06.489 --> 08:08.329
A logical place to start.

08:09.529 --> 08:10.949
I'll pull together a list.

08:10.949 --> 08:15.829
George, also look into any recent
child abduction cases, as well.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.029
Sir.

08:18.029 --> 08:20.529
You heard him. Let's get moving.

08:20.529 --> 08:23.129
The chances of Bobby's safe
return diminish by the hour.

08:25.089 --> 08:29.689
We must consider all possibilities,
sir, some quite distasteful.

08:29.689 --> 08:30.989
I know what you have to do.

08:38.863 --> 08:41.743
If they've touched one single hair
on his head... Thomas.

08:42.763 --> 08:45.383
"They"? Do you know who took Bobby?

08:45.383 --> 08:48.563
Not yet, love. I was just saying.

08:48.563 --> 08:52.303
Mrs Brackenreid, we'll not
rest until your son has returned.

08:52.303 --> 08:54.823
It's all my fault.
I should never have left him.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.043
I'm going out of my mind.

08:59.043 --> 09:01.723
Margaret, listen to me.

09:01.723 --> 09:04.263
I swear to you that
I'll bring Bobby home.

09:04.263 --> 09:08.003
But you must have faith
in me and the department.

09:11.723 --> 09:13.923
But now, there's work to do.

09:16.103 --> 09:18.843
You go right ahead.
I'll wait here until there is news.

09:33.221 --> 09:37.141
William, I just heard
about Bobby Brackenreid.
Is there something I can do?

09:37.141 --> 09:39.441
At this point, I'm not sure.

09:53.041 --> 09:55.761
Julia, should we hear the worst...

09:59.001 --> 10:05.041
Thomas had just come out of the army
when father asked him to join the
family's plumbing business. Really?

10:05.041 --> 10:09.981
He'd have been a good plumber,
I thought, but his heart
was set on the police force.

10:09.981 --> 10:12.261
I'm sure it's not easy,
married to a policeman.

10:12.261 --> 10:13.921
I knew what I was getting in to.

10:13.921 --> 10:17.501
No point in complaining about
the long hours. And the worry.

10:17.501 --> 10:20.341
But still... I worried more
after we had the two boys.

10:20.341 --> 10:23.001
If something should happen to Thomas.

10:23.001 --> 10:25.361
I never dreamed it would be
one of the boys in danger.

10:25.361 --> 10:27.801
Can I interest you in a stroll,
Mrs Brackenreid?

10:27.801 --> 10:31.361
The air's so still in here.
Do you think Thomas would mind?

10:33.061 --> 10:35.101
I'm sure it would be perfectly fine.

10:47.641 --> 10:50.301
Do you recognize
any of these men, Miss Dewar?

10:50.301 --> 10:53.141
I only saw him a moment.

10:53.141 --> 10:55.161
Take your time.

10:55.161 --> 10:59.121
I didn't expect so much fuss
over me and my purse,

10:59.121 --> 11:03.361
me being a duster girl and all.
It does the heart good.

11:03.361 --> 11:05.261
We try to be thorough.

11:12.481 --> 11:14.521
It might be this man, Detective.

11:14.521 --> 11:17.681
But I can't be on my life certain.

11:26.101 --> 11:28.281
You were seen
in Seaton Park this morning.

11:29.561 --> 11:34.561
I don't go to Seaton Park.
Mr Carson, this is a serious matter.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.401
A seven-year-old boy is missing.

11:36.401 --> 11:38.601
I had nothing to do with it.

11:38.601 --> 11:42.401
If you know what's best for you,
you'll tell us where the boy is.

11:43.801 --> 11:46.081
Seven-year-olds
are a little young for me.

11:46.081 --> 11:49.661
Where the bloody hell
have you got my son?

11:49.661 --> 11:51.281
I wish I had seen your lovely boy.

11:53.601 --> 11:54.621
Inspector.

12:03.141 --> 12:04.221
Sit down.

12:13.822 --> 12:17.022
Sir, if we don't keep our wits
about us, mistakes will be made.

12:17.022 --> 12:19.062
Keep my wits?
Is that what you suggest?

12:19.062 --> 12:21.062
I realise this is difficult, sir.

12:21.062 --> 12:25.222
I find out Jeb Carson was within
half a mile of that park, I'll
put the noose around him myself.

12:25.222 --> 12:28.082
We'll keep him until
we speak to his alibi.

12:28.082 --> 12:30.622
I don't care if the Archbishop
of Canterbury can vouch for him.

12:30.622 --> 12:33.042
He's staying till Bobby's back
safe and sound.

12:34.102 --> 12:36.342
These types makes my flesh crawl.

12:36.342 --> 12:39.462
We're tracking down
as many as we can.

12:39.462 --> 12:42.002
The thought of Bobby
with somebody like that...

12:42.002 --> 12:44.222
Sirs, Mr Stanton to see you.

12:44.222 --> 12:48.202
This arrived in the morning mail.
Frankly, I am mystified.

12:48.202 --> 12:51.202
"We are wanting
$10,000 for your son.

12:51.202 --> 12:53.682
"Our instructions
we will soon deliver."

12:53.682 --> 12:55.562
They've snatched your boy, too?
No.

12:55.562 --> 12:57.762
Robert's at home with his mother.

13:00.922 --> 13:05.482
Sir, I believe the kidnappers
think they have Mr Stanton's son.

13:05.482 --> 13:10.042
They took the wrong boy
from the park... Margaret.

13:17.382 --> 13:19.902
It was a mistake?
So it seems. Thank God.

13:19.902 --> 13:23.402
They'll let Bobby go the moment
they realise their error. Maybe...

13:23.402 --> 13:25.862
I should go. He'll be home
any minute, tired and hungry.

13:25.862 --> 13:27.922
Yes, you go home.
I'll be along shortly.

13:31.322 --> 13:33.162
I'll go with her. Thank you, Doctor.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.702
Margaret's got one thing right.

13:39.702 --> 13:41.482
Bobby's no use to the kidnappers.

13:41.482 --> 13:45.962
But if they find out who he
really is, they won't let him go.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.122
They'll kill him.

13:55.722 --> 13:58.102
Thank you for your cooperation,
Mr Stanton.

13:58.102 --> 14:02.122
It's critical that
the kidnappers believe that
it's your son they've taken.

14:02.122 --> 14:05.702
Not too bright, taking the wrong
boy. Amateurs. Makes them dangerous.

14:05.702 --> 14:08.482
Whatever the case, could there
be a personal motive?

14:08.482 --> 14:11.782
Would a former business associate
be capable of this crime?

14:11.782 --> 14:15.482
I suppose. I didn't raise myself up
in business by courting popularity.

14:15.482 --> 14:17.222
Anyone else come to mind?

14:17.222 --> 14:19.582
Former household staff,
with a grievance?

14:19.582 --> 14:22.402
I recall
a disgruntled employee or two.

14:22.402 --> 14:24.362
We'll need that list, please.

14:24.362 --> 14:26.462
You shall have all
the names you need.

14:27.338 --> 14:30.738
Mr Stanton,
we would like you to deliver
the ransom, if you're agreeable.

14:30.738 --> 14:32.918
Of course.
This is a matter of civic duty.

14:32.918 --> 14:34.738
Good. I'll put the money together.

14:34.738 --> 14:37.858
All you need do is drop it
off under our watchful eye. Fine.

14:37.858 --> 14:42.838
Now, if that's all, I will
contact you once I've heard
from the kidnappers. Good day.

14:44.978 --> 14:46.998
How long can we keep up
this pretence?

14:46.998 --> 14:48.958
Bobby himself
could have let it slip.

14:48.958 --> 14:54.338
Then we must work quickly. "Our
instructions we will soon deliver."
What kind of clap-trap is that?

14:54.338 --> 14:56.418
"We will soon deliver."

14:56.418 --> 15:00.958
The time qualifier comes
before the verb. It's cocked up,
but what does it signify?

15:00.958 --> 15:08.618
If I recall my secondary school
language lessons, the wording
suggests German syntax. Syntax?

15:08.618 --> 15:11.598
The German language is very precise.
Unique in some ways.

15:11.598 --> 15:15.178
The kidnapper's German?
Or pretending to be.

15:16.418 --> 15:17.638
What are you looking at?

15:18.678 --> 15:19.778
The watermark.

15:26.278 --> 15:31.338
Sir, Ramsden's Printers supplies
stock with this watermark to
a number of different companies.

15:31.338 --> 15:35.838
Thank you, George.
You may want to draw your attention
to the bottom of the list, sir.

15:38.758 --> 15:39.958
The Stanton Brewery.

15:39.958 --> 15:44.098
Stanton?
Everything's on the cheap with him.

15:44.098 --> 15:45.778
Not an easy man to work for, then?

15:46.858 --> 15:51.038
Talk to anyone here, Inspector,
they'll tell ya. Hey, Pete?

15:51.038 --> 15:52.758
Yeah, Ned?

15:52.758 --> 15:55.858
Pete Morgan.... Shift foreman.

15:55.858 --> 15:59.278
Inspector and Detective here
want to know about the boss.

15:59.278 --> 16:04.318
They say Stanton's son's
been kidnapped. Get off!

16:04.318 --> 16:10.198
Gentlemen, we are eager
to speak with any workers who
may have wished Mr Stanton harm.

16:10.198 --> 16:14.078
Hell of a long line, that would be.
See those barrels?

16:14.078 --> 16:19.658
Try heavin' them onto the drays
day in day out without crippling
yerself. Stanton doesn't care.

16:19.658 --> 16:22.098
Lose fingers, your pay
gets docked for time off.

16:22.098 --> 16:25.258
And don't go getting sick
or yer out, friend.

16:25.258 --> 16:29.358
No free beer, neither. Yes, well,
that's all very well and good,

16:29.358 --> 16:32.718
but we're looking for someone with
a real grievance against him.

16:32.718 --> 16:37.858
Maybe they should talk to Otto
Schroeder. The brewmaster.

16:37.858 --> 16:40.118
Hates Stanton like a hornet soup.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.578
Didn't show up today till noon.

16:46.558 --> 16:49.758
Schroeder... A fine German name.

16:58.078 --> 16:59.798
If you would just sign your name.

16:59.798 --> 17:03.058
It is true,
I have no love for Herr Stanton.

17:03.058 --> 17:07.318
Why is that, Mr Schroeder? Ten years
ago, we were to set up a business.

17:07.318 --> 17:10.637
He wanted to open a brewery,
but he knew nothing.

17:10.637 --> 17:14.198
I am a brewmaster, trained by my
grandfather. I have the knowledge.

17:14.198 --> 17:17.958
But he had the money? We signed
an agreement for my recipe.

17:17.958 --> 17:19.858
$25 he paid.

17:19.858 --> 17:23.438
My recipe, a fine German lager,
built his fortune.

17:23.438 --> 17:26.738
ã25! So he cheated you.

17:26.738 --> 17:31.498
He sees it not like that. I paid
you, he said, fair and square.

17:31.498 --> 17:35.298
A swindle like that needs to be set
right. Yes. So you kidnapped his son.

17:35.298 --> 17:36.618
Was? Nein.

17:36.618 --> 17:41.398
We found the same paper
in your office, Mr Schroeder.
Many people come into my office.

17:41.398 --> 17:43.798
Who were you working with?
No more "was ist das?".

17:43.798 --> 17:46.418
Who's your accomplice?
I know nothing!

17:46.418 --> 17:48.938
Why weren't you at work
this morning? I felt ill.

17:48.938 --> 17:51.358
Where's the boy?!
You have the wrong man!

18:01.838 --> 18:05.718
Stanton fleeced Herr Schroeder
out of his fair share of a fortune.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.658
He had access to the brewery
stationery, he missed work,

18:08.658 --> 18:11.318
and he's a bloody Kraut
He wrote that note.

18:11.318 --> 18:13.238
But the handwriting doesn't match.

18:13.238 --> 18:17.718
Oh, come on, he knew you were taking
a sample. He disguised his hand.

18:17.718 --> 18:22.258
In handwriting analysis,
attention is paid to the stops

18:22.258 --> 18:25.358
and starts in the formation
of the letters, the pen-lifts.

18:25.358 --> 18:28.898
If someone is consciously
trying to write differently...

18:28.898 --> 18:33.098
They'll hesitate as they write.
Exactly. A person's natural hand
has a smooth flow.

18:33.098 --> 18:36.238
Schroeder was not trying to fool us.
So?

18:36.238 --> 18:39.058
You said yourself
there were two of them.

18:39.058 --> 18:41.718
His partner could be
the literary genius.

18:41.718 --> 18:44.318
Check Schroeder's alibi
and tear his house apart.

18:44.318 --> 18:46.018
But, sir... Just do it, Murdoch!

18:46.018 --> 18:46.978
Yes, sir.

19:01.198 --> 19:03.538
Deal with this, Sergeant,
immediately.

19:03.538 --> 19:05.718
There was nothing
at Schroeder's house.

19:05.718 --> 19:08.078
You're sure, Murdoch,
absolutely sure?

19:08.078 --> 19:11.278
His wife and a neighbour
confirmed his alibi. I'm sorry, sir.

19:11.278 --> 19:13.458
All right, all right.
What else do we have?

19:13.458 --> 19:17.258
Nothing new, sir. The maid and
the gardener have airtight alibis.

19:17.258 --> 19:20.718
The pederast, Jeb Carson, is in
the clear, too. At least for this.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.538
The delivery from the bank.

19:23.538 --> 19:26.098
At least the bank's
agreed to front the ransom.

19:26.098 --> 19:29.298
Helps to have a bank manager
who owes you a favour. Don't ask.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.938
What about Stanton's
business associates?

19:31.938 --> 19:34.718
Every hops supplier in town
has had run-ins with him.

19:34.718 --> 19:38.598
And a builder
who claims he was never paid,
but they all have solid alibis.

19:38.598 --> 19:42.918
The ransom note links
to the Stanton brewery,
but if Schroeder wasn't involved...

19:42.918 --> 19:47.478
That narrows it down to what,
100 suspects at the brewery?
Interview them all, would you?

19:47.478 --> 19:49.718
With all respect,
I've been thinking...

19:49.718 --> 19:52.238
I don't want you to think,
I want you to act!

19:52.238 --> 19:55.798
My son has now been missing
seven hours. Yes, sir.

19:55.798 --> 19:58.218
I want some bloody answers, Murdoch.

19:58.218 --> 20:01.558
We're all working
as hard as we can, sir.

20:01.558 --> 20:03.658
This Stanton.

20:03.658 --> 20:09.078
You can't treat people like
slaves and not expect consequences.

20:09.078 --> 20:11.938
The man's put my boy in
mortal danger. Inspector.

20:14.718 --> 20:17.098
You, Stanton.

20:17.098 --> 20:21.858
One spark of decency in you and
none of this would have happened.
Inspector. Please.

20:21.858 --> 20:25.918
Do you have news, Mr Stanton?

20:25.918 --> 20:28.258
This came in the afternoon mail.

20:35.218 --> 20:40.618
What does it say? "The bag you
must leave in the 15th pew... "

20:40.618 --> 20:42.838
There's that bloody
German syntax again.

20:42.838 --> 20:44.598
"In St Michael's church. 8.00pm."

20:45.598 --> 20:47.298
That only gives us half an hour!

20:47.298 --> 20:52.038
I came here as quickly as I could.
That wasn't quickly enough, was it?
What are you implying?

20:54.858 --> 20:57.558
Inspector, I realise
you're under a great strain,

20:57.558 --> 21:00.438
but you must understand I am
being as co-operative as I can.

21:00.438 --> 21:03.938
Sir, they obviously mean to deny
us sufficient time to devise a...

21:03.938 --> 21:06.198
A plan. I'll tell you the plan.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.138
Mr Stanton drops off the bag.

21:08.138 --> 21:13.478
We jump the ... that picks it up
and I'll beat him to a pulp until
he tells us where Bobby is.

21:13.478 --> 21:17.898
Sir, I really don't think...
That's the plan, Murdoch.
We don't have time to debate it.

21:19.998 --> 21:20.998
Mr Stanton.

22:43.063 --> 22:45.163
Where's the boy?

22:45.163 --> 22:48.543
Boy? What boy?
Don't try that with me. Where is he?

22:48.543 --> 22:49.603
Lay off, will ya?

22:49.603 --> 22:51.703
I got paid two dollars
to pick up the bag.

22:51.703 --> 22:55.163
Who paid you? I just saw the money.

22:55.163 --> 22:56.483
Sir! I know this man, sir.

22:56.483 --> 23:00.603
Yes, George? His name is Jack,
a sot from down the docks.

23:00.603 --> 23:04.763
He wouldn't hurt a soul,
unless you're in the way
of his next bottle. That's right.

23:04.763 --> 23:08.283
You, where were you to take the bag?

23:09.223 --> 23:12.923
Harvey's Lane. Under the walkway.

23:28.683 --> 23:31.003
Sir. What's it say? It seems
they've anticipated our actions.

23:33.003 --> 23:35.963
They want 20,000.

23:49.983 --> 23:54.223
Sir, I've tried, but can't lift any
fingermarks from the ransom notes.

23:55.443 --> 23:58.763
Where am I going to get another
$10,000 before the next drop Murdoch?

23:58.963 --> 24:01.263
Don't lose heart, sir.

24:01.763 --> 24:03.103
The most recent ransom note.
What about it?

24:04.103 --> 24:07.863
It's evident the kidnappers still
believe they have the Stanton boy.

24:07.963 --> 24:10.223
They don't realise they have Bobby.

24:10.423 --> 24:13.343
Where is he, Murdoch?

24:13.543 --> 24:14.363
We'll find him, sir.

24:15.943 --> 24:17.343
You want children some day don't you?

24:18.023 --> 24:19.903
I hope to have a son some day.

24:23.323 --> 24:26.663
I've not had a lot of time for mine,
what with this bloody job and everything.

24:26.763 --> 24:29.003
I've left it all to Margaret.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.263
understandable.

24:32.663 --> 24:36.403
and being totally honest,
I've never understood Bobby.

24:36.503 --> 24:37.563
He lives in a fantasy world.

24:37.663 --> 24:39.723
At the moment,
it's pirates and buried treasure.

24:41.223 --> 24:42.683
Games of imagination sir

24:43.183 --> 24:46.963
A good father makes time for his boy.

24:47.063 --> 24:48.003
Shows him the way.

24:49.023 --> 24:53.083
I swear by Almighty God,
if I can have him back

24:53.283 --> 24:55.583
You will

24:57.507 --> 24:58.467
Not without $20,000.

25:11.287 --> 25:14.187
Why hasn't Thomas telephoned?

25:14.187 --> 25:19.587
Margaret, I'm sure you'll be the
first person the Inspector
calls when there's news.

25:19.587 --> 25:25.027
No. He's keeping me in the dark to
protect me. I'm sure Detective
Murdoch does the same thing for you.

25:25.027 --> 25:29.587
Actually, despite the often
gruesome subject matter,
William and I talk quite openly.

25:29.787 --> 25:31.507
Lucky you.

25:31.607 --> 25:34.107
But all that changes when you get married.

25:34.107 --> 25:35.267
with children.

25:36.407 --> 25:38.387
I suppose.

25:38.387 --> 25:41.367
Though I'm not sure
children are in my future.

25:41.467 --> 25:45.267
Still, Thomas is as fine a
father as one could want.

25:45.467 --> 25:49.407
Last winter, when the boys had the croup,
Thomas went days
without sleep tending to them,

25:49.507 --> 25:54.027
and went to work everyday without complaint,
near collapse, as he was.

25:54.027 --> 25:55.987
That sounds like him.

25:55.987 --> 26:00.167
I was so grateful,
but he wouldn't hear a thank you.

26:01.267 --> 26:04.087
Policemen. They have their moments.

26:04.087 --> 26:06.287
Some reserved for you,
if you're lucky.

26:07.787 --> 26:11.227
You're a steadfast
and loving wife, Margaret.

26:11.227 --> 26:14.567
I admire you, I honestly do. I...

26:16.067 --> 26:17.667
Margaret?

26:24.127 --> 26:26.447
We could use counterfeit bills sir.

26:26.547 --> 26:28.227
That would take too long to arrange.

26:28.327 --> 26:30.847
well, this looks like $20,000.
Surely the kidnappers are going

26:30.947 --> 26:35.867
to want to get back
to their hiding spot,
rather than linger around and count it all.

26:36.067 --> 26:39.187
Let's hope so George
We have no other options.

26:39.187 --> 26:42.307
The drop is in one hour, gentlemen.
Are we all set?

26:42.307 --> 26:43.867
The money's ready, sir.

26:43.867 --> 26:45.807
What's this? We improvised.

26:45.807 --> 26:48.847
$20,000 is a bit rich on
an inspector's salary.

26:49.047 --> 26:52.067
It's taking too big of a chance.
What choice do I have? None.

26:52.067 --> 26:53.527
It's why I brought this.

26:55.467 --> 26:57.507
The additional 10,000.

27:01.767 --> 27:05.467
I know what it is to be a father.

27:05.567 --> 27:08.567
Mr Stanton,
you are a gentleman, sir.

27:08.567 --> 27:11.867
If you insist, Inspector.

27:11.867 --> 27:17.107
Now, to business. Detective,
what's the plan?

27:17.107 --> 27:21.207
Mr Stanton, you will make the drop
at the mill, as instructed.

27:21.207 --> 27:27.147
I've studied the area extensively sir and  I believe
I can observe from a distance,

27:27.147 --> 27:29.767
without being discovered.

27:32.327 --> 27:34.407
You and only you, Murdoch.

27:34.507 --> 27:37.447
But back off if there's
any chance you being seen.

27:37.627 --> 27:40.647
Yes, sir.
This time it's got to work.

29:33.107 --> 29:34.547
Stop! Police!

29:50.567 --> 29:53.847
Sir! I think he's got the scent.

29:55.707 --> 29:56.987
Come on, Murdoch.

30:00.327 --> 30:03.367
We're heading south, sir.

30:06.587 --> 30:09.047
The old mill, sir.

30:09.047 --> 30:12.587
Perhaps Bobby has been here
the whole time.

30:31.327 --> 30:33.507
Murdoch?

30:39.587 --> 30:40.907
Sir?

31:04.207 --> 31:05.527
Sir!

31:10.727 --> 31:12.487
It's Bobby's shoe.

31:17.287 --> 31:18.587
he bastards have killed him

31:30.814 --> 31:36.994
Bobby! Bobby!

31:44.154 --> 31:45.854
It shouldn't have been my boy.

31:47.514 --> 31:48.594
I'm sorry, Margaret.

31:48.694 --> 31:53.374
You promised to bring him back.
You were to bring him back!

31:53.374 --> 31:55.454
SHE SOBS

32:32.427 --> 32:36.907
Sir, I'm sorry, we've found nothing.

32:37.007 --> 32:39.387
The body must have been swept
down the river.

32:39.487 --> 32:44.007
George, I need you
to find a butcher's.

32:55.087 --> 32:56.087
Just as I thought. Sir?

32:57.087 --> 33:02.387
George, stay here.
Don't let anyone on this dock.

33:19.847 --> 33:24.967
KNOCK ON DOOR
Inspector? What is it, Murdoch?

33:25.007 --> 33:29.927
I've examined the dock... Stop it.

33:30.027 --> 33:32.727
It's finished, it's over.

33:32.927 --> 33:35.707
He was dead long before
we delivered the ransom.

33:35.907 --> 33:40.327
Sir, I believe... I failed, Murdoch.

33:42.207 --> 33:44.967
I failed everyone.

33:46.887 --> 33:50.027
Sir, I believe Bobby may still
be alive.

33:50.127 --> 33:51.927
Don't.

33:52.027 --> 33:53.727
Please.

33:54.127 --> 33:56.927
Don't you dare give me false hope.

33:57.547 --> 33:59.687
Inspector...

34:00.227 --> 34:03.207
I don't say this lightly.

34:06.867 --> 34:09.367
The geometric shape of a
bloodstain determines the direction

34:09.367 --> 34:13.147
it was travelling in
when it hit the ground.

34:13.246 --> 34:19.027
See, now the tip of the oval
points towards the shore.

34:19.226 --> 34:20.266
What does that prove?

34:20.567 --> 34:26.306
I created a second blood trail,
this time travelling
from the shore to the dock.

34:26.407 --> 34:29.947
See, the tip of the oval
now points towards the water.

34:30.047 --> 34:34.306
They don't match. Exactly.

34:39.847 --> 34:43.927
Whoever created this blood trail was
travelling from the dock to shore.

34:44.127 --> 34:46.967
But the blood on the floor?

34:53.487 --> 34:57.467
The pattern of the bloodstain, a
small spread with no fine droplets,

34:57.567 --> 35:01.307
suggests it was poured onto
the floor from a low height.

35:01.407 --> 35:05.687
What about Bobby's shoe?

35:07.207 --> 35:10.607
These are rough fibres I found
in the blood from Bobby's shoe.

35:10.907 --> 35:14.847
I believe a piece of sackcloth
was used to rub blood on the shoe.

35:15.547 --> 35:19.487
Bobby's death was staged, sir.
He's alive.

35:25.107 --> 35:27.107
Right then.

35:27.207 --> 35:29.507
It was staged.

35:29.607 --> 35:31.607
But why did the bastards want us to think he's dead

35:32.325 --> 35:34.825
So we would stop looking.

35:37.405 --> 35:41.045
William. Perhaps one of
the kidnappers could be a woman.

35:42.345 --> 35:43.145
Go on.

35:43.645 --> 35:47.945
A woman, perhaps unable
to have a child of her own,
and desperate for one?

35:49.345 --> 35:52.325
It's not unheard of.

35:52.525 --> 35:57.345
Just any child? Or young
Robert Stanton in particular?

35:57.845 --> 35:58.845
I never thought I would have a child.

35:58.945 --> 36:04.725
The day Robert came into
our lives was a miracle.

36:07.285 --> 36:09.445
If the kidnapper is a woman,

36:09.445 --> 36:12.905
perhaps she was in
the park that day.

36:16.765 --> 36:22.425
Who would expect so much fuss
over me and my purse.
It might be this man, Detective.

36:24.425 --> 36:28.225
We should see if Evie Dewar has had
any sudden need to leave town.

36:33.885 --> 36:37.285
Do you really think she could be
one of the kidnappers?

36:37.385 --> 36:39.445
She's cleaned out her flat
and skipped out on the rent.

36:39.545 --> 36:41.265
Not the actions
of an innocent victim.

36:41.365 --> 36:42.745
But she walked right into
the station and...

36:42.845 --> 36:46.965
And pointed us to the pederast,
Jeb Carson. We'd be sure
to take that bait.

36:47.065 --> 36:51.205
So after the so-called attack,
her accomplice doubles back
and takes Bobby? Possibly.

36:51.305 --> 36:55.225
So then who exactly do you want to show
this sketch of Evie Dewar to?

36:55.325 --> 37:01.065
If I'm right, to a woman
who was once desperate
for a child of her own.

37:02.265 --> 37:05.705
Detective, I don't understand
why you're showing this to me.

37:05.905 --> 37:10.345
You don't recognize this woman?
No. Darling?

37:10.545 --> 37:12.825
Detective, what's this got to do
with anything?

37:13.025 --> 37:19.625
Mr and Mrs Stanton. The safe return
of the Inspector's son
may depend on your willingness

37:19.625 --> 37:22.945
to speak of something I believe
you've held secret for many years.

37:23.145 --> 37:27.325
A word, sir... No, dear.

37:27.525 --> 37:30.305
It's all right.

37:30.445 --> 37:34.605
No, detective,

37:34.805 --> 37:38.305
I did not give birth to Robert.

37:38.525 --> 37:43.365
I couldn't have...
We couldn't have children.

37:43.765 --> 37:45.125
I'm terribly sorry.

37:46.425 --> 37:51.925
If I may - how did you come
to find your son?

37:52.925 --> 37:55.845
This is Molly Morgan.

37:55.945 --> 38:01.165
She's Robert's... she was the one
who borne him. You knew her?

38:01.265 --> 38:02.845
She lived in a tenement near me.

38:02.945 --> 38:09.285
No more than 16, all by herself,
and in trouble
in more ways than one.

38:09.385 --> 38:14.905
She was going to prison for
thieving and the little fella
would end up in an orphanage.

38:15.005 --> 38:18.985
I knew Mrs Stanton wanted a baby
very badly.

38:19.085 --> 38:20.865
And Molly was willing
to give up her child.

38:21.065 --> 38:23.765
Oh, that was powerful sad
to see, that day.

38:23.865 --> 38:27.365
But it was better than
the children's home.
Where would we find Miss Morgan?

38:27.465 --> 38:31.285
Oh, sir, I've no idea. None at all.

38:32.085 --> 38:34.045
Crabtree.
I want to hear you found something.

38:34.245 --> 38:37.765
Inspector, I believe I have. There
are three Molly Morgans on file.

38:37.765 --> 38:42.165
Now I don't know if any of them gave
birth seven years ago, that being
Robert Stanton's age,

38:42.265 --> 38:44.885
but one of them
did just get out of jail.

38:44.885 --> 38:47.105
Seven years for larceny.
She's got to be the one.

38:47.205 --> 38:49.965
Seven years is a long time to
think about the child she gave up.

38:50.065 --> 38:52.165
And a long time to plan
to get him back.

38:52.265 --> 38:54.025
But she didn't pull this off
by herself, Murdoch.

38:54.125 --> 38:57.965
No sir, and let's not foget, whoever wrote the ransom notes
has a connection to the Stanton brewery.

38:58.165 --> 39:01.765
Crabtree, how many more of Stanton's
employees have we questioned?
A dozen. Is that all?

39:01.965 --> 39:04.725
Can we connect any of them
to Molly Morgan?

39:04.925 --> 39:07.345
None that I can think of, sir.

39:07.545 --> 39:13.065
Hold on. The name of the shift
foreman we met at Stanton's brewery.
What was his name?

39:13.185 --> 39:17.305
Hey, Pete. Pete Morgan.

39:17.405 --> 39:23.045
Pete Morgan. George,
telephone Stanton brewery.

39:23.045 --> 39:25.105
and find out if Pete Morgan showed up
for work today.

39:25.205 --> 39:28.965
This Morgan fellow - as I remember,
there was no love lost for Stanton.

39:29.065 --> 39:31.985
None sir. So you're telling me
we almost had him in our hands

39:32.085 --> 39:36.825
Sir, there's no way we could
have known at the time.
Sirs. Pete Morgan quit yesterday.

39:36.925 --> 39:41.565
Get an address.
205 Brunswick Avenue, thank you.
Come on, Murdoch.

39:45.185 --> 39:48.385
Get the telephone
for 205 Brunswick Avenue.

39:51.125 --> 39:55.445
Sirs! Stop. What is it, George?
I've just talked to his landlord.

39:55.445 --> 39:59.485
Pete Morgan moved out three days
ago. Bollocks! It's not over yet sir.
Let's think.

39:59.585 --> 40:05.245
Pete Morgan may have moved out three days
ago but he was still working at the brewery
until yesterday.

40:05.245 --> 40:07.745
He must be staying nearby.
Yes, but where?

40:07.745 --> 40:11.385
George, the city directories
and survey maps.

40:16.045 --> 40:19.345
Sirs, I think I have something.
This survey map of Etobicoke,

40:19.445 --> 40:23.365
a lot belonging to M and P Morgan
near the Humber River.
Molly and Pete.

40:23.465 --> 40:26.425
It's less than a mile from where
Bobby was being held.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.625
Irving, grab the map.
You two get the carriages.

40:31.175 --> 40:35.155
This must be it, sir.
Pray to God that Bobby's in there.
It's the only cabin on the lot.

40:38.055 --> 40:40.795
Right then.
Sir.

40:40.895 --> 40:42.355
We don't know what we're in for.

40:42.555 --> 40:43.555
Go!

40:54.375 --> 40:56.495
That's Morgan all right.

40:56.595 --> 40:58.095
Sir, let us take care of it.

40:58.195 --> 41:01.095
Once he's in custody, I'm straight
in that cabin. Yes, sir.

41:10.315 --> 41:12.415
Toronto Police. Quiet.

41:17.895 --> 41:20.695
Is the boy in the cabin? Well?

41:23.875 --> 41:27.015
Are you taking me home now,
like you promised?

41:27.015 --> 41:29.815
You're going to a new home,
a wonderful new home.

41:29.915 --> 41:33.315
Daddy! Who are you?

41:33.515 --> 41:39.475
I'm Thomas Brackenreid, Miss Morgan.
I've come for my son.

41:39.475 --> 41:43.475
Sorry, mister, this is my boy.
Get out of here. Daddy?

41:43.575 --> 41:45.195
It's all right, Bobby.

41:45.395 --> 41:47.635
You made a mistake.

41:47.735 --> 41:49.675
You took the wrong boy.

41:49.775 --> 41:52.255
No, he's mine. You can tell,
he looks just like me.

41:52.455 --> 41:57.635
This isn't the Stanton boy, Molly.
He's not yours. Get back!

41:57.835 --> 42:01.555
No-one's taking him away from me!
I won't lose him again. I won't.

42:01.755 --> 42:08.655
It must be terrible to have to
give up your own flesh and blood.

42:09.055 --> 42:13.635
What my wife and I have been through
these last two days, we know
how you must have felt.

42:13.735 --> 42:17.395
What would you know? I have him
back, that's all that matters.

42:17.395 --> 42:20.455
This boy has a mother.

42:20.555 --> 42:25.175
She's waiting for him. This is his
father, come to take him home.

42:25.275 --> 42:29.755
I don't believe you.
Why are you lying to me?
This isn't your boy.

42:29.855 --> 42:36.655
And you know it, Molly.
A mother knows her own child.

42:38.035 --> 42:41.035
You are my boy, aren't you? No.
He's my daddy.

42:44.035 --> 42:45.195
I want to go home.

42:49.635 --> 42:52.215
Go on home, then.

43:20.875 --> 43:25.475
Ready to sail! He seems no worse
for wear for his adventure.

43:25.875 --> 43:29.395
Took it in his stride.
Chip off the old block.

43:29.495 --> 43:31.035
You're a good man,
Thomas Brackenreid.

43:35.475 --> 43:39.535
Daddy, are you coming?

43:39.835 --> 43:46.735
Excuse me, Margaret,
I think my ship is about to sail.
Hold on, me hearties, hold on!

43:48.435 --> 43:48.755
Thank you.

43:48.855 --> 43:52.215
Throw me a sword!

43:52.415 --> 43:53.575
En garde!

43:54.675 --> 43:59.015
It's clear the thought of reuniting
with her son sustained Molly Morgan
while she was in prison.

43:59.215 --> 44:01.955
Becoming something of
an obsession, I would think.

44:02.155 --> 44:06.415
Her only wish. The ransom demands
were her brother's idea.

44:06.515 --> 44:10.195
Taking advantage of your own
sister's desire to have her
son back. It's monstrous.

44:10.295 --> 44:13.575
You do feel some sympathy for her.
It's understandable.

44:13.775 --> 44:17.715
If we hadn't arrived when we did,
the Brackenreids may never have
seen their son again.

44:21.015 --> 44:23.535
The Inspector seems to be
adjusting well to pirate life.

44:24.035 --> 44:26.575
What an ordeal.

44:26.875 --> 44:28.055
Indeed.

44:28.255 --> 44:31.415
Being a parent carries
such heavy responsibilities.

44:31.515 --> 44:34.195
Though it appears
to have its rewards.

44:37.915 --> 44:38.995
Yes, so it seems.

44:43.335 --> 44:46.495
Over here, Mummy. Thank you, son.

44:46.795 --> 44:50.155
Thank you. Is she seaworthy, son?
