Help me! Somebody, please help me!

05:26.618 --> 05:28.408
Help me!

05:29.488 --> 05:31.358
Somebody...

06:59.611 --> 07:02.869
- Help me, please!
- Jesus.

07:04.099 --> 07:05.601
He's right behind me. Please.

07:05.701 --> 07:09.270
You're safe. Amber, right? Amber Ryder?

07:10.989 --> 07:13.659
All units. All units. This is Doyle.

07:13.759 --> 07:18.330
10-99 on Begos Road near the hospital.
I got her. Send medical.

07:18.430 --> 07:20.649
No, no, no, we have to get out of here.
He's gonna kill me.

07:20.749 --> 07:23.669
Amber, listen.
Everyone's been out looking for you.

07:23.769 --> 07:25.687
The whole area is on lockdown
and he knows it.

07:25.787 --> 07:29.124
Someone will be by here in a minute to
take you out of here and then we'll get him.

07:29.224 --> 07:32.390
I promise. I'm gonna get
a blanket from the trunk and...

08:15.587 --> 08:17.610
It's okay.

08:31.169 --> 08:35.094
Okay, Henry. Okay.

11:31.983 --> 11:36.866
Yeah. I'll tell him, but... Yeah, I understand
that, Lu, but you know what he'll say.

11:38.590 --> 11:40.770
Okay, Lieutenant.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.095
- No.
- Matt.

11:43.195 --> 11:45.397
- No, Darcy.
- I told him you'd say that.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.766
Then why the hell are we still
having this conversation?

11:47.866 --> 11:51.870
So I can follow a direct order and tell
the lieutenant I relayed his message.

11:51.970 --> 11:54.840
Fine. Go ahead.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.884
It's CNN this time.

11:56.984 --> 12:00.489
- They're asking for 5 minutes, Matt.
- No.

12:01.279 --> 12:03.060
We good?

12:12.691 --> 12:15.124
- You know, it might be good to talk to them.
- Christ, not again.

12:15.224 --> 12:16.261
Not for you. The victims.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.397
The families deserve to hear more
than dry line items of the case reports.

12:19.497 --> 12:21.600
It's over, Darcy. He's dead.
If they can't accept that...

12:21.700 --> 12:25.468
No, no, no, it's not about accepting it.
They wanna understand.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.355
Understand?

12:27.455 --> 12:30.108
What more is there to understand?

12:30.208 --> 12:32.711
He was random and vicious.

12:32.811 --> 12:37.315
The Garrets want to understand?
The Masons, they want to understand?

12:37.415 --> 12:41.319
Do the Thompsons really want to understand
exactly what was going through Henry's mind

12:41.419 --> 12:44.990
as he snatched up their girl up and whipped
her to death with the chain off her bicycle?

12:45.090 --> 12:47.959
Jesus, Matt. I'm not asking you
to rationalize it for them.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.795
A lot of kids get knocked around
by their old man.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.099
The problem is how some of them
choose to deal with it.

12:54.199 --> 12:57.547
It's also a problem
when they choose not to deal with it.

12:59.587 --> 13:01.668
It's late.

13:24.462 --> 13:25.530
Hey.

13:25.630 --> 13:29.668
Please tell me we're not still talking
about this. There's nothing new.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.915
Yeah, well...

13:33.471 --> 13:35.818
Must have been Henry's.

13:46.251 --> 13:47.486
Can I help you?

13:47.586 --> 13:51.590
You have something
that don't belong to you, Detective.

13:51.690 --> 13:55.827
Wait, I know you, from Henry's file.
You're that Degraty woman...

13:55.927 --> 14:00.064
DeGracie, Della DeGracie. The one who
found Henry the night his father died...

14:00.164 --> 14:02.434
The night.

14:02.534 --> 14:05.137
And I have to have back that item.

14:05.537 --> 14:09.174
- Henry had a box.
- Look, lady, it's been a long day, alright.

14:09.274 --> 14:11.676
Anything of Henry's has to be filed
with the police clerk.

14:11.776 --> 14:15.291
You can come down to the station tomorrow
we'll see what we can do.

14:36.768 --> 14:38.603
Mom, I'm done. Come look.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.640
- Okay, baby. Are your shoes on?
- Yeah.

14:40.740 --> 14:43.925
Because mine are not. I can't find them,
have you seen my brown sandals?

14:44.025 --> 14:47.178
- Mom?
- Okay, okay, sorry.

14:47.278 --> 14:49.359
Let me see.

14:49.714 --> 14:52.718
Oh, so pretty.

14:53.318 --> 14:56.883
Nice job. Okay, get ready.
Here, we gotta get going, okay?

15:00.158 --> 15:02.972
Uh, Buddy, get down.

15:04.762 --> 15:08.066
Sweetheart, we talked
about this when we moved in.

15:08.166 --> 15:10.301
There's no reason for you
to be afraid of Buddy.

15:10.401 --> 15:13.371
He would never hurt you, I promise. Okay?

15:13.471 --> 15:16.786
- It's Daddy!
- What?

15:17.642 --> 15:20.090
Oh, great.

15:26.017 --> 15:28.431
There's my girl!

15:33.091 --> 15:35.328
- I'm gonna keep you, Daddy.
- And I'm gonna keep you.

15:35.428 --> 15:37.493
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

15:37.593 --> 15:41.366
- Look what I made.
- Whoa, that is beautiful.

15:41.466 --> 15:46.349
- I know. Do you have anything for me?
- It's in the car, sweetheart.

15:52.777 --> 15:56.981
Jesus, Matt. We've been through this.
You can't just show up here.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.362
I needed to see her.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.531
I saw the news.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.590
- You got him, huh?
- I got him.

16:05.690 --> 16:08.560
- You alright? You seem...
- I'm fine.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.873
Of course you are.

16:12.063 --> 16:15.711
Well, good for you.

16:16.701 --> 16:20.516
- The shoes you were looking for...
- Thank you.

16:23.474 --> 16:25.710
Hey, Matt.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.612
Ethan.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.793
Come on, I'll be in the car, okay?

16:33.684 --> 16:36.232
Come on, Chloe, let's get in the car.

16:40.591 --> 16:43.139
Take care of yourself, Matt.

17:16.828 --> 17:19.130
There's my favorite girls.

17:19.230 --> 17:22.550
- Hi.
- Hey, kiddo.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.686
What's up, Toddy?
You know I have a dolly, right?

17:25.787 --> 17:28.580
Nope. Did not get that information.

17:28.790 --> 17:31.492
- So, you're helping us out today?
- Yeah, I'm making some stuff, too.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.096
- Yeah? You better save something for me.
- Uh, guys. Still heavy.

17:35.196 --> 17:39.712
- Alright, just take it in the back, babe.
- Let's go, squirt. Grab the door.

17:44.338 --> 17:47.208
- You guys good?
- Yeah.

17:47.308 --> 17:48.810
Todd keeps having nightmares.

17:48.910 --> 17:51.646
We're still living in the one-bedroom
shithole he grew up in.

17:51.746 --> 17:54.015
So he's not sleeping very well.

17:54.115 --> 17:57.619
I'm sorry. What about
the interview from the other day?

17:57.819 --> 18:00.421
We're still waiting to hear back.

18:00.521 --> 18:04.726
God, he's been out of work
for... six months now.

18:04.826 --> 18:08.708
- I'm sorry.
- It's really killing him.

18:09.997 --> 18:12.511
I don't know how we're staying afloat.

18:13.134 --> 18:16.437
Which by the way, thank you for...
the extra hours and stuff.

18:16.537 --> 18:19.355
- Really appreciate it.
- Hey, don't even.

18:19.455 --> 18:21.819
I wish, I could do more.

18:22.577 --> 18:26.292
He's gonna find something.
Something great.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.951
We'll see.

18:30.084 --> 18:33.488
- I just had to get him out of the house.
- Oh, yeah.

18:55.243 --> 18:58.981
- Congratulations on Bale, Detective.
- Thank you.

20:01.008 --> 20:03.578
Mommy, it's cold in this.

20:03.678 --> 20:05.882
Great, honey.

21:16.117 --> 21:19.054
Oh, my God, these are so cool.

21:19.220 --> 21:21.923
That's my daughter, Chloe.
She's a jewelry designer.

21:22.023 --> 21:26.762
And I think she is having a sale.
Two dollars?

21:28.095 --> 21:31.367
- Got a sweatshop goin', huh?
- Obviously.

21:33.267 --> 21:37.472
- Do you have this in a set?
- I'm sorry, just the one.

21:37.572 --> 21:41.843
That's a shame.
Your father would like one for his study.

21:42.143 --> 21:44.812
- I can make some calls and see if I can...
- No, that's okay.

21:44.912 --> 21:49.517
Listen, give me your name and email.
I'll let you know when we get more like that.

21:49.617 --> 21:50.718
Okay?

21:50.818 --> 21:53.721
- Thank you.
- Of course. There you go.

21:53.821 --> 21:56.057
I'll take one.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.394
Alright.

22:00.161 --> 22:02.551
How's that look, Chloe?

22:04.532 --> 22:07.203
Chloe-bear, you've got a customer.

22:10.872 --> 22:12.509
Chloe?

22:14.308 --> 22:16.878
Baby, where did you get those things?

22:16.978 --> 22:18.814
Chloe?

22:30.391 --> 22:34.130
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

22:35.730 --> 22:38.167
What happened, seizure?

22:39.400 --> 22:42.403
It's okay, baby, just...
just listen to Mommy's voice.

22:42.503 --> 22:44.038
Remember, it'll go away.

22:44.138 --> 22:48.044
Hey, Chloe, did you make these?

22:48.442 --> 22:50.211
This is so cool.

22:50.311 --> 22:52.747
Can I buy it from you?

22:52.847 --> 22:54.717
Yeah?

23:01.355 --> 23:04.427
- Bye.
- Feel better.

23:06.127 --> 23:08.564
Chloe, you're a hit.

23:12.700 --> 23:15.137
That was a tough one.

23:16.470 --> 23:19.548
Hey, do you think you can go solo for a bit?
I'm gonna take her home.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.857
Yeah, yeah, of course.

23:22.476 --> 23:24.697
Go home, baby?

23:35.622 --> 23:38.394
Forgotten how ugly that wall was.

23:42.897 --> 23:44.934
You okay?

23:45.566 --> 23:48.738
My father would have been 72 today.

23:56.944 --> 23:59.982
You still taking Chloe to Disneyworld?

24:03.050 --> 24:07.523
Happiest place on Earth.
You think you can handle it?

24:08.222 --> 24:10.926
It was supposed to be Amy, too.

24:11.158 --> 24:15.429
Three years ago, I said,
after I catch this guy...

24:15.529 --> 24:17.767
we can...

24:18.566 --> 24:20.603
Whatever.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.738
I never...

24:24.838 --> 24:27.810
told you this 'cause I was too ashamed.

24:28.542 --> 24:31.512
The day we found Tyler Richardson's body,

24:31.612 --> 24:34.850
Amy made me promise to come home early.

24:35.316 --> 24:37.718
Well, we found Tyler...

24:37.818 --> 24:40.221
I forgot all about it.

24:40.321 --> 24:43.028
Got home around 2 am, walked in,

24:43.128 --> 24:46.495
Amy and Chloe are asleep on the couch.

24:46.961 --> 24:50.599
"Happy Birthday, Chloe Bear"
banner on the mantle.

24:52.867 --> 24:55.303
Presents and cake...

24:57.972 --> 25:01.642
I remember this bastard's
birthday every year.

25:01.742 --> 25:04.280
I forgot my own daughter's.

25:05.579 --> 25:07.416
Anyway.

25:08.449 --> 25:11.153
Amy woke up when I walked in.

25:13.153 --> 25:15.690
We just stared at each other.

25:16.190 --> 25:18.528
Neither one of us said anything.

25:20.995 --> 25:23.833
Guess that's when we knew it was over.

25:27.101 --> 25:29.605
God, I fucked it up.

25:30.538 --> 25:33.008
Yeah, you did.

26:06.974 --> 26:09.543
Here, really?

26:09.643 --> 26:11.981
Just do it.

26:15.082 --> 26:17.585
Wouldn't you feel more
comfortable buying this?

26:17.685 --> 26:20.957
Hey, I've gotta do the hard part.

26:25.259 --> 26:27.529
Are you sure?

26:28.462 --> 26:30.900
I'm three weeks late.

26:35.369 --> 26:37.740
What is it, babe?

26:39.606 --> 26:42.077
It's a lot to take in.

26:46.947 --> 26:49.251
It's gonna be okay.

27:34.395 --> 27:36.766
That'll be $9.94.

27:41.168 --> 27:44.974
Son? $9.94.

27:47.475 --> 27:49.979
Cash or charge, son?

27:53.781 --> 27:57.366
Hey... are you alright?

28:12.633 --> 28:16.372
- Mom, can I have my blanket?
- Of course.

28:20.708 --> 28:23.112
I miss Daddy.

28:27.648 --> 28:29.851
Come on, Buddy.

28:30.251 --> 28:32.521
There you go.

28:38.025 --> 28:40.262
What's wrong, Mommy?

28:40.861 --> 28:43.165
Nothing, baby.

28:43.730 --> 28:48.937
Hey, do you know who became
a professional jewelry designer today?

28:50.004 --> 28:51.872
You did.

28:51.972 --> 28:54.808
When you sell something,
that makes you a professional.

28:54.908 --> 28:59.415
I'm so proud of you. You know, Aunt Becca
says she's gonna wear hers every day.

29:00.314 --> 29:04.084
You know, maybe you and I
should be business partners.

29:04.184 --> 29:06.520
Can I be the boss?

29:06.620 --> 29:09.056
Yes, you can be the boss.

29:09.156 --> 29:11.493
And guess what?

29:12.059 --> 29:14.395
I have a present for you.

29:14.495 --> 29:18.766
Guess who bought the very last
Chloe William's original today?

29:18.866 --> 29:21.103
I wanna wear it.

29:22.419 --> 29:26.173
Not while you are sleeping, baby.
It's dangerous. Sorry.

29:26.273 --> 29:28.911
I have an idea. Give me your wrist.

29:31.478 --> 29:33.749
Mm-hmm.

29:37.184 --> 29:39.319
I love you, baby.

29:39.419 --> 29:41.976
- I love you.
- Sweet dreams.

30:19.059 --> 30:21.530
Hey, over here.

30:25.666 --> 30:28.602
You gonna tell me why we're suddenly
on top of the batting order again?

30:28.702 --> 30:32.311
- This isn't our case, Darce.
- Just watch.

30:33.073 --> 30:36.343
The kid's name is Conner Heffler.
And the clerk's Tommy Logan.

30:36.443 --> 30:39.555
Kid goes off camera for a second to get
a pregnancy test for his girlfriend

30:39.655 --> 30:42.583
- who is waiting in the car.
- And where's she at now?

30:42.683 --> 30:46.020
I had a uniform
take her back to the station.

30:46.253 --> 30:48.623
Kid goes to pay...

30:49.256 --> 30:50.724
Why, he tweaking?

30:50.824 --> 30:53.731
Running a tox screen now.
Girlfriend came up clean. Same as the car.

30:53.831 --> 30:55.764
Swears Heffler was, too.

30:58.132 --> 30:59.822
Jesus.

31:04.304 --> 31:06.108
Fuck.

31:08.208 --> 31:09.943
You gonna tell me
what this has to do with me?

31:10.043 --> 31:12.114
Just look.

31:21.288 --> 31:23.625
Comes the storeowner.

31:28.862 --> 31:32.501
That's... this has to do with you.

31:58.392 --> 32:00.862
How the hell did that kid do that?

32:01.328 --> 32:05.245
Henry's calling card wasn't public record.
It was redacted from all reports,

32:05.345 --> 32:09.503
all photos specifically so some nut job
doesn't go out and play copycat.

32:09.603 --> 32:11.939
Where there's a will...

32:12.039 --> 32:16.744
What, is he, just some highly resourceful
psycho kid lookin' to go out in the spotlight?

32:16.844 --> 32:19.847
- Probably.
- Bullshit.

32:20.147 --> 32:23.298
You don't believe that. If you did,
you wouldn't be here. You'd be off...

32:23.398 --> 32:26.486
doing whatever it is you do these days
'cause I've stopped trying to figure it out.

32:26.586 --> 32:29.758
- What the hell do you want from me?
- I want you to say it.

32:30.090 --> 32:34.229
Tell me the first thing that came into your
mind when you saw what that kid drew in there.

32:35.662 --> 32:40.801
Come on, Matt. The brutality of that attack,
the rage. That and the mark.

32:40.901 --> 32:45.074
You're really gonna tell me that's just some
half-ass interpretation of Henry's MO?

32:45.906 --> 32:48.910
Why are you still standing here?

32:51.411 --> 32:53.852
Because it was perfect.

34:55.001 --> 34:57.272
What was that?

35:02.843 --> 35:04.878
- She's not in here!
- I'm gonna check the other room.

35:04.978 --> 35:07.829
Chloe? God.

35:08.048 --> 35:10.534
- I can't find her.
- She's not in this room either.

35:10.634 --> 35:12.853
Chloe!

35:12.953 --> 35:15.490
God, where is she?

35:21.995 --> 35:24.199
Oh, my God.

35:28.602 --> 35:30.665
Where is Chloe?

35:31.204 --> 35:35.210
- Chloe.
- Hey, hey, Amy, Amy, Amy.

35:38.011 --> 35:40.415
Oh, my God.

35:42.182 --> 35:44.019
Chloe?

35:44.384 --> 35:46.688
Are you in here?

36:10.911 --> 36:13.682
- Chloe?
- Honey?

36:15.782 --> 36:17.586
Chloe!

36:24.558 --> 36:27.963
Oh, my God. I'm calling an ambulance.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.204
- What have we got?
- Juvenile female, eight years old

36:37.304 --> 36:40.874
hypertensive, unresponsive.
Respiration erratic. She's an epileptic.

36:40.974 --> 36:42.142
Then?

36:42.242 --> 36:46.913
Mother reports a regular course of Topamax.
150 milligrams. Last dose 7 p.m.

36:47.013 --> 36:48.915
Area 1 is open.

36:49.015 --> 36:52.185
Oh, wait. You guys can't go in.
She's in really good hands.

36:52.285 --> 36:56.090
I promise to let you know something
as soon as I possibly can, alright?

36:56.490 --> 36:58.758
Why don't you come over here?
There is room to wait. Okay?

36:58.858 --> 37:01.296
We'll be fine. That's okay.

37:23.316 --> 37:26.286
Ms. Bayer? Trisha?

37:26.386 --> 37:28.822
I'm Detective Williams.

37:28.922 --> 37:30.759
Matt.

37:38.999 --> 37:43.970
Believe me, we wanna find out why
this happened as bad as you, so...

37:44.070 --> 37:47.108
is it okay if I ask you
a couple of questions?

37:47.641 --> 37:51.679
You and Conner aren't from here.
Why were you in town?

37:52.145 --> 37:54.382
School's out.

37:54.915 --> 37:58.487
Driving home to Florida, Pensacola.

37:59.552 --> 38:01.956
Stopped on our way through.

38:02.522 --> 38:05.192
- School is where?
- Iowa.

38:05.292 --> 38:07.162
Hawkeyes?

38:09.295 --> 38:14.703
- You and Connor ever take any drugs?
- No. Conner never...

38:15.869 --> 38:18.073
and I'm pregnant.

38:18.772 --> 38:22.610
I mean, I think I am.

38:23.076 --> 38:26.646
That's why Conner...
he went into the store.

38:28.915 --> 38:31.553
It's okay. Have some water.

38:34.721 --> 38:36.923
How did Conner know the store clerk?

38:37.023 --> 38:39.159
He didn't.

38:39.259 --> 38:41.099
Trisha...

38:41.199 --> 38:44.164
the way he attacked that man
there had to be something personal.

38:44.264 --> 38:48.703
No. Never.
We've never even been here before.

38:55.308 --> 38:59.214
Have you ever heard the name
Henry Leonard Bale?

39:00.513 --> 39:02.951
The serial killer?

39:04.684 --> 39:08.622
Is it possible Conner
would had contact with him?

39:08.722 --> 39:11.258
What? No!

39:11.358 --> 39:13.093
Of course, not. Never.

39:13.193 --> 39:16.830
Maybe followed the case?
Took a special interest?

39:16.930 --> 39:18.832
No.

39:18.932 --> 39:21.302
Not at all.

39:23.370 --> 39:25.207
Why?

39:31.678 --> 39:33.849
Have you ever seen this symbol before?

39:34.948 --> 39:37.051
What is that?

39:37.784 --> 39:40.054
What is that?

39:41.454 --> 39:43.190
Oh, my God.

39:43.290 --> 39:46.761
This officer is gonna take
really good care of you.

39:57.370 --> 39:59.639
You didn't have to show her the picture.

39:59.739 --> 40:02.709
- Nope.
- You just wanted to see her reaction.

40:02.809 --> 40:06.648
- Yeah.
- She doesn't know shit.

40:07.047 --> 40:08.434
Nope.

40:31.571 --> 40:33.740
Where is she?

40:33.840 --> 40:35.575
They sedated her.

40:35.675 --> 40:38.580
I don't understand. The dog?

40:40.146 --> 40:42.082
I wanna see her.

40:42.182 --> 40:44.385
She's in there.

40:47.454 --> 40:48.521
I should leave.

40:48.621 --> 40:51.157
- Ethan.
- No, he's her father.

40:51.257 --> 40:54.227
And you're my fiancee. Stay with me.

40:57.397 --> 40:59.634
Hello, Detective.

41:00.900 --> 41:03.137
I'm Dr. Wells.

41:03.603 --> 41:05.906
- What is this?
- We don't know yet.

41:06.006 --> 41:08.842
She's an eight-year-old girl
for Christ's sakes.

41:08.942 --> 41:10.143
Did you hear what she did?

41:10.243 --> 41:12.645
- I can't explain that.
- What can you explain?

41:12.745 --> 41:15.938
The blood we took shows extremely
elevated stress hormone levels

41:16.038 --> 41:17.851
consistent with an epileptic seizure.

41:17.951 --> 41:20.353
She's had seizures before.
Nothing like this.

41:20.453 --> 41:25.091
The nature of seizures is unpredictable,
Detective. Especially in children.

41:25.191 --> 41:28.195
Now, you said she had another
intense episode earlier today?

41:28.295 --> 41:30.530
- Yeah.
- What?

41:30.630 --> 41:34.936
It was over in a minute. Like always.
I handled it. She was fine.

41:35.502 --> 41:38.872
You wanna talk about how many times I've handle
this on my own in the last couple of years?

41:38.972 --> 41:41.107
Hey. Nobody did anything wrong.

41:41.207 --> 41:44.379
What's important is that
we're taking care of her now.

41:45.011 --> 41:46.446
What's next?

41:46.546 --> 41:49.749
Well, the standard protocols
have failed to lower her pulse

41:49.849 --> 41:53.720
or her blood pressure as much
as I'd like to see. But she'll level out.

41:53.820 --> 41:56.990
The best thing is to keep her sedated
and let her get a rest.

41:57.090 --> 41:58.993
Thank you, doctor.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.302
Ethan.

42:09.402 --> 42:11.638
I can't bring her back
to the house like that.

42:11.738 --> 42:14.675
- No, no, I'll take care of it.
- I'm so sorry.

42:14.775 --> 42:18.478
No, no, I'll be back as soon as I can.

42:18.578 --> 42:20.782
It's okay.

42:29.322 --> 42:31.559
It's okay, baby.

42:32.759 --> 42:35.029
Daddy's here.

42:50.410 --> 42:52.280
Hey.

42:53.346 --> 42:55.716
It's gonna go great.

42:56.249 --> 42:59.353
They wouldn't have called you again
if they didn't want you.

42:59.586 --> 43:01.821
I'll believe that
when they offer me the job.

43:01.921 --> 43:04.492
And then we'll have a celebration dinner.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.895
Hopefully.

43:10.830 --> 43:13.067
It's a good luck charm.

43:13.399 --> 43:15.937
Chloe would want you to have that.

43:17.103 --> 43:19.340
How is she doin'?

43:21.574 --> 43:25.012
She's fine. She's a tough kid.

43:25.578 --> 43:27.714
I'm gonna go up there later
and bring them some food.

43:30.717 --> 43:32.987
Oh, shit.

43:33.553 --> 43:35.688
It's Thursday.

43:35.788 --> 43:38.092
I gotta pay Big Al.

43:39.692 --> 43:42.597
- Like we can afford this.
- Hey.

43:42.962 --> 43:45.433
Everything's gonna be okay.

43:46.466 --> 43:48.369
We'll get through this.

45:41.314 --> 45:43.349
- Hey, Bec.
<i>- Hey.</i>

45:43.449 --> 45:46.152
She's asleep right now.
Actually, they both are.

45:46.252 --> 45:48.021
No. That's fine. Don't wake her.

45:48.121 --> 45:51.290
I just wanna come by later on today
maybe if you could give me the room number?

45:51.390 --> 45:54.727
<i>She's in Room 101.
Come by whenever you can.</i>

45:54.827 --> 45:57.630
Hey, baby, did you check on Big Al?
Oh, my God.

45:57.730 --> 46:00.167
Todd, are you okay? What happened?

46:00.633 --> 46:02.568
Todd...

46:02.668 --> 46:05.038
All you do is just take.

46:05.138 --> 46:08.742
What? Todd, I'm gonna
call you an ambulance.

46:09.142 --> 46:11.045
Becca, you still there?

46:12.078 --> 46:14.198
There's nothing left.

46:14.847 --> 46:17.050
I am nothing!

47:27.787 --> 47:30.495
Come on, come on, come on.

47:48.140 --> 47:51.512
Becca? Todd?

47:57.350 --> 47:59.954
Todd, Becca.

48:01.788 --> 48:04.557
Matt! I'm in the bathroom.

48:04.657 --> 48:08.863
There's something wrong with Todd!
He's trying to kill me!

48:12.314 --> 48:14.417
I'm walking towards you.

48:14.517 --> 48:16.354
Okay.

48:31.551 --> 48:33.486
Matt.

48:34.086 --> 48:36.623
It's okay. Where's Todd?

48:36.723 --> 48:40.795
I don't know.
I don't know where the fuck he went.

48:47.200 --> 48:50.038
- No!
- No!

48:55.291 --> 48:59.549
God. No! No! No. Hold on. Hold on.

48:59.649 --> 49:01.495
Shit.

49:14.026 --> 49:17.652
Todd, buddy, put down the shears.

49:20.132 --> 49:22.302
Don't do it.

49:45.391 --> 49:47.595
It's okay.

49:48.394 --> 49:50.181
Jesus.

50:19.759 --> 50:21.966
What is it?

50:23.062 --> 50:27.068
- Look.
- It does look like the ones Henry had.

50:31.971 --> 50:33.873
Jesus. Chloe.

50:39.178 --> 50:44.383
I need full medical backup. 79/12
Eagle Crest Drive. I need immediate support.

50:48.654 --> 50:51.938
- When do the new tests come back?
- A few more hours.

50:52.358 --> 50:55.895
- Matt, where did you go?
- Emergency at work. How is she?

50:55.995 --> 51:01.071
- She's not stabilizing like I hoped.
- Doc, is it possible for skin to contact

51:01.171 --> 51:03.803
a drug or toxin to cause
what happened to Chloe?

51:03.903 --> 51:05.538
A drug? Matt, what...

51:05.638 --> 51:08.709
- Doc, is it possible?
- Yes.

51:09.241 --> 51:11.544
Amy, Chloe took something
from the back of my car.

51:11.644 --> 51:13.779
It was a wooden box filled with figurines.

51:13.879 --> 51:16.148
She might have thought
they were jewelry charms.

51:16.248 --> 51:19.190
- But...
- Amy, charms? Did Chloe have one?

51:19.290 --> 51:24.256
Yeah. She made a necklace, a bracelet.
We turned it into a bracelet. So?

51:24.356 --> 51:28.060
EMTs would've removed
and bagged any items on her person.

51:28.160 --> 51:30.563
I'm on it. I'll meet you at the car.

51:30.663 --> 51:33.415
Matt, what is going on?
What... the charms? And you...

51:33.515 --> 51:35.551
I think they're laced
and if Chloe handled them...

51:35.651 --> 51:38.054
But nothing came up
in the routine tox screen.

51:38.204 --> 51:41.974
But this severe asthmatic affect
it would have been pretty nasty stuff.

51:42.074 --> 51:45.144
- Way out of the ordinary.
- Can you treat it?

51:45.244 --> 51:49.382
If we knew what we were treating.
Otherwise we're just shooting in the dark.

51:49.482 --> 51:51.786
Okay, I'll find it.

51:54.920 --> 51:57.656
I'm gonna need you to stay by the phone.

51:57.756 --> 51:59.626
Okay.

52:00.226 --> 52:04.285
Wait. I have to tell Becca.
Chloe gave her one of those things.

52:07.733 --> 52:10.003
What is it?

52:11.120 --> 52:14.223
- Did you tell her about Becca?
- I told her enough.

52:14.323 --> 52:17.294
Becca was Amy's best friend.

52:19.411 --> 52:23.182
- I'm sorry.
- What about you? You got anything?

52:23.282 --> 52:26.285
Yeah. The EMT that brought Chloe in.
It's his day off.

52:26.385 --> 52:29.056
His boss is gonna try to track him down.

52:30.623 --> 52:34.160
Henry was in and out of backwoods
psych clinics his whole life.

52:34.260 --> 52:37.596
He could have loaded up
on all kinds of psychotropic shit.

52:37.696 --> 52:40.466
Yeah, but... I mean, what, are we
gonna call every one of those places

52:40.566 --> 52:43.102
and ask for inventory records
over the last 20 years?

52:43.202 --> 52:47.874
- How many of them are even still around?
- You got a better idea?

52:48.374 --> 52:51.545
Yeah, I think there's someone
we need to talk to.

53:12.932 --> 53:15.801
Jesus! Look at this place.

53:15.901 --> 53:19.940
Well, she wanted that box
so she must know something about it.

53:23.943 --> 53:26.614
Which is one more thing than we do.

53:58.744 --> 54:03.083
- Hello?
- I was wondering when you'd come.

54:06.952 --> 54:09.522
Miss DeGracie, we need your help.

54:09.622 --> 54:11.684
Yes, you do.

54:11.924 --> 54:14.929
Come. Sit.

54:19.865 --> 54:22.248
That night at the old hospital.

54:23.168 --> 54:25.639
You asked about this.

54:26.605 --> 54:29.043
They're poisoned.

54:30.409 --> 54:32.880
Yeah. I... I know.

54:36.415 --> 54:38.517
With what?

54:38.617 --> 54:41.955
Nothing you'll find here or anywhere else.

54:43.255 --> 54:46.926
Look, my daughter is very sick.

54:47.026 --> 54:49.762
Alright? So, I need your help.

54:49.862 --> 54:52.131
You said the dolls, they're poisoned?

54:52.231 --> 54:55.968
I had the feeling you'd be
more comfortable with that...

54:56.068 --> 54:58.926
than if I said they're cursed.

55:01.707 --> 55:05.211
Oh, Detective, you came to me.

55:05.311 --> 55:10.083
And I can help you,
but only if you really hear me.

55:31.036 --> 55:33.372
You've seen this?

55:33.472 --> 55:36.642
- Henry drew this?
- No.

55:36.742 --> 55:40.648
This was drawn a little bit
before Henry's time.

55:41.614 --> 55:44.385
Have you ever heard of a worry doll?

55:46.185 --> 55:49.621
Sure, they're like children's toys.

55:49.721 --> 55:52.559
No. Not all of them.

55:55.961 --> 55:59.099
The night I found Henry Bale...

56:00.149 --> 56:02.251
I looked into his eyes.

56:02.351 --> 56:04.536
<i>He was a broken boy.</i>

56:04.636 --> 56:07.239
<i>Innocence gone.</i>

56:07.589 --> 56:12.279
I could see the darkness
already growing in him. So...

56:12.779 --> 56:16.784
I gave him... the worry dolls.

56:18.050 --> 56:23.557
The last of the original worry dolls
and I explained to him their power.

56:24.256 --> 56:28.595
Power? Come on.
I knew this was a waste of time.

56:30.562 --> 56:35.650
Detective, your daughter
must be in great pain.

56:39.405 --> 56:41.340
What are you doing?

56:41.440 --> 56:45.596
So young. She must be terrified.

56:45.911 --> 56:48.318
And you can't help her.

56:53.118 --> 56:55.489
Help me, Daddy.

57:01.093 --> 57:03.530
It's a paralytic.

57:06.565 --> 57:09.737
Just one drop.

57:10.285 --> 57:11.589
Yes.

57:13.672 --> 57:16.142
My grandparents...

57:16.742 --> 57:19.611
lived in a very small village

57:19.711 --> 57:23.983
of Huehue in the... deep
in the mountains of Guatemala.

57:24.783 --> 57:29.523
Their medicine woman was named
Delate, my great-grandmother.

57:30.155 --> 57:34.226
One summer,
the women started getting sick.

57:34.326 --> 57:35.995
Many died.

57:36.095 --> 57:38.363
The children were terrified...

57:38.463 --> 57:40.766
including Delate's own daughter.

57:40.866 --> 57:44.303
Delate could not stand to see this.

57:44.553 --> 57:46.956
She believed that every child

57:47.056 --> 57:50.275
should know only innocence.

57:50.375 --> 57:53.078
And so she fashioned...

57:53.178 --> 57:56.582
<i>MuÃ±ecas quitapenas.</i>

57:56.682 --> 57:58.951
Worry dolls...

57:59.201 --> 58:01.370
from a wood...

58:01.470 --> 58:03.856
of a very rare tree.

58:03.956 --> 58:09.730
Delate didn't just make dolls
that simply calmed fear...

58:10.229 --> 58:12.666
they removed it.

58:13.565 --> 58:15.801
When worries are told to the dolls

58:15.901 --> 58:20.187
they must be placed in the box.

58:20.872 --> 58:22.608
The dolls...

58:22.708 --> 58:26.211
they... they take

58:26.311 --> 58:28.982
worries out overnight.

58:30.549 --> 58:33.621
But Henry never slept.

58:34.586 --> 58:37.489
I shot him. Killed him.

58:37.589 --> 58:40.493
He knew we were coming down on him.

58:41.193 --> 58:42.578
He was expecting to die.

58:42.678 --> 58:45.030
Oh, my God.
Henry was trying to purge his soul.

58:45.130 --> 58:48.502
And the worry and fear...

58:49.134 --> 58:51.236
carried by Henry Bale...

58:51.336 --> 58:55.374
a man who had only known pain and hate...

58:55.474 --> 58:58.444
remains in those dolls.

58:58.544 --> 59:02.481
Expressing through anyone
unfortunate enough to have one.

59:02.581 --> 59:05.951
So you're saying these people
are experiencing Henry's fears?

59:06.051 --> 59:10.289
- Seeing into his mind?
- No. The fears were their own.

59:10.389 --> 59:14.739
The every day burdens
that we live with but amplified

59:14.839 --> 59:18.730
to a level unbearable by most people.

59:18.830 --> 59:22.034
This became their reality.

59:22.134 --> 59:23.869
- Dogs.
- What?

59:23.969 --> 59:25.837
Chloe's afraid of dogs.

59:25.937 --> 59:27.973
The only way to save her

59:28.073 --> 59:31.076
is to get the dolls and quickly.

59:31.176 --> 59:32.728
But she doesn't even have
the dolls anymore.

59:32.828 --> 59:37.099
That doesn't matter.
She's a pure innocent.

59:37.249 --> 59:40.385
Never had to deal with the fears of life.

59:40.485 --> 59:43.124
Ironic, people...

59:43.224 --> 59:45.657
who have suffered the most...

59:45.757 --> 59:48.627
have the strongest resistance.

59:48.827 --> 59:52.766
Your daughter is just gonna get worse.

59:53.832 --> 59:56.068
She'll die.

59:56.668 --> 59:59.204
In the meantime, you gather

59:59.304 --> 01:00:02.808
all the dolls and the box...

01:00:02.908 --> 01:00:05.310
and bring them here to me
along with your daughter.

01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:08.515
That is the only way.

01:00:09.748 --> 01:00:12.219
How much time do I have?

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:16.123
Until dawn.

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:22.187
Amy, do have any idea
where those dolls might be?

01:00:22.427 --> 01:00:25.798
- No, I don't.
- Just think. I need to find the dolls.

01:00:25.898 --> 01:00:27.966
Do you know what's happening
with Chloe or not?

01:00:28.066 --> 01:00:30.396
They're special. They belonged
to Henry Bale. Somehow...

01:00:30.496 --> 01:00:34.503
Henry Bale? Are you kidding me?

01:00:34.973 --> 01:00:37.497
You're supposed to be helping
our daughter and instead you're back

01:00:37.597 --> 01:00:41.581
- on your Henry Bale obsession?
- Wait, wait, Amy. Just... just hold on.

01:00:42.481 --> 01:00:45.785
Becca didn't die in an accident.
Todd killed her.

01:00:46.185 --> 01:00:48.053
- What?
- Todd.

01:00:48.153 --> 01:00:50.189
He slashed her throat with trimming shears

01:00:50.289 --> 01:00:53.959
and he was wearing one of those dolls when
he did it. That homicide at the mini-mart?

01:00:54.059 --> 01:00:56.562
He was also wearing one of those dolls.

01:00:56.662 --> 01:01:01.367
I know how this sounds
but I need to find those dolls.

01:01:01.467 --> 01:01:06.138
This could be Chloe's last chance.
Somehow it left something in her.

01:01:06.238 --> 01:01:09.741
<i>And if I don't find them all the doctors,
they're not gonna be able to do any good.</i>

01:01:09.841 --> 01:01:12.913
So hate me, just help me.

01:01:16.781 --> 01:01:18.586
Okay.

01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:29.444
Oh, my God. Help! Help!

01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:00.459
That was fast. Did you get it?

01:02:00.559 --> 01:02:05.230
Helps to have an evidence clerk who's
asked me to drinks every week. What do we got?

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:07.032
This is it.
It's the only one after Trisha.

01:02:07.132 --> 01:02:11.164
If we find this one, the only one left was the
one Chloe had on her. Any word on the EMT?

01:02:11.264 --> 01:02:14.106
No. Just an e-mail address?
Didn't Amy remember anything else?

01:02:14.206 --> 01:02:16.942
She said she was
with an elder woman in a wheelchair.

01:02:17.042 --> 01:02:18.946
Let's go.

01:02:28.587 --> 01:02:30.289
That e-mail comes back
to a Brittany Hayden.

01:02:30.389 --> 01:02:32.424
There are four
Brittany Haydens in the county.

01:02:32.524 --> 01:02:35.894
I cross-checked hospitals for the wheelchair
bound family members, but no luck.

01:02:35.994 --> 01:02:39.698
But my friend Savannah
works in the city zoning office.

01:02:39.798 --> 01:02:42.276
Yeah. Address?

01:02:42.376 --> 01:02:46.465
Right. In the past ten years, only one
household with the resident named Hayden

01:02:46.565 --> 01:02:49.574
had a zoning permit issued
for a wheelchair ramp.

01:02:55.681 --> 01:02:59.786
<i># I can stop crying #</i>

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:05.042
<i># Over you #</i>

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:11.264
<i># Can't sing half smiling #</i>

01:03:11.863 --> 01:03:16.269
<i># Now I'm so sad and blue #</i>

01:03:16.635 --> 01:03:20.000
Sweetheart, is your father home yet?

01:03:27.279 --> 01:03:30.015
That's too much water.

01:03:33.418 --> 01:03:36.944
- Clark Street. Says it's a mile up ahead.
- What time is it?

01:03:37.044 --> 01:03:39.255
- Midnight.
- Shit.

01:03:39.355 --> 01:03:42.028
Hey, we'll be fine. There's time.

01:03:42.628 --> 01:03:45.330
<i># I can't stop praying... #</i>

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:50.103
Sweetheart, well, what's wrong?

01:03:59.511 --> 01:04:02.598
I can't see it.
Dammit, can you see anything?

01:04:02.948 --> 01:04:05.551
- No.
- Dammit.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:08.956
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:04:43.288 --> 01:04:46.226
It's okay. Hey, hey, look at me.

01:04:46.525 --> 01:04:48.596
It's okay.

01:04:50.195 --> 01:04:52.397
It's okay.

01:04:52.497 --> 01:04:55.669
Alright? We're gonna get you
to a hospital, okay?

01:05:09.414 --> 01:05:12.853
She's in there. Thanks, guys.

01:05:14.719 --> 01:05:16.922
Still no word from Chloe's EMT.

01:05:17.022 --> 01:05:19.526
She's all I got left.

01:05:21.092 --> 01:05:23.595
Hey, we will find the doll. Alright?

01:05:23.695 --> 01:05:26.119
Chloe's gonna be fine.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.087
Williams.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:36.208
- Where's the EMT?
- I don't know.

01:05:36.508 --> 01:05:37.576
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

01:05:37.676 --> 01:05:40.447
I didn't touch anything
just like you said.

01:05:44.416 --> 01:05:47.652
That's not it.
Ames, are you sure you don't know...

01:05:47.752 --> 01:05:50.388
I don't. I don't know where doll is.
If I knew I would tell you.

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:53.975
- If he doesn't have it, I don't know.
- Sorry to interrupt. You said it was a doll?

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:55.861
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I remember that thing.

01:05:55.961 --> 01:06:00.267
- I bagged it. I gave it to her father.
- Her father?

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.703
Ethan. Where's Ethan now?

01:06:04.803 --> 01:06:07.339
He went to clean up the mess
and get Chloe's blanket.

01:06:07.439 --> 01:06:10.277
He's at the house? Now?

01:07:12.103 --> 01:07:13.974
Hello?

01:07:15.874 --> 01:07:18.145
Anyone home?

01:07:22.547 --> 01:07:24.851
The door was open.

01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:33.127
Ethan?

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:39.066
Ethan?

01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.976
It's Darcy.

01:07:51.042 --> 01:07:53.280
Matt's partner.

01:08:07.359 --> 01:08:09.196
Ethan?

01:08:50.902 --> 01:08:53.473
Darcy? Ethan?

01:09:03.881 --> 01:09:06.651
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let her go, Ethan.

01:09:06.751 --> 01:09:10.290
You have any idea how much I love her?

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:13.758
But it will still not be enough.

01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:16.694
Ethan. Please.

01:09:16.795 --> 01:09:19.997
You have caused them so much pain.

01:09:20.098 --> 01:09:23.750
- Drop the glass.
- And still...

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.291
I will not have her like you had.

01:09:30.075 --> 01:09:32.344
Why, Amy? Huh?

01:09:32.444 --> 01:09:36.180
What do I... what do I need to do? Huh?

01:09:36.281 --> 01:09:39.585
He thinks I'm Amy, Matt.

01:09:40.171 --> 01:09:45.358
Ethan... please, you are making a mistake.

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:48.560
Ethan, listen to me.

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:51.895
This isn't real. It's not Amy.

01:09:51.996 --> 01:09:55.867
- You need to fight this.
- No. I'm on to you.

01:09:56.467 --> 01:10:00.905
- I'm on to you.
- Ethan, Amy loves you.

01:10:01.005 --> 01:10:05.410
Chloe loves you.
You've always been a better father.

01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:07.313
Amy...

01:10:08.613 --> 01:10:10.816
tell him.

01:10:11.216 --> 01:10:13.451
Ethan, it's true.

01:10:13.551 --> 01:10:18.256
Sweetheart, I love you. I love you so much.

01:10:18.356 --> 01:10:23.029
Please, please, sweetheart.
You're hurting me.

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:26.831
Please, let me go.

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:29.501
That's it. That's it.

01:10:29.601 --> 01:10:32.504
I love you, Ethan.

01:10:32.804 --> 01:10:34.806
Don't doubt that.

01:10:34.906 --> 01:10:38.378
Never, never, ever worry.

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:41.180
I love you.

01:10:43.982 --> 01:10:46.252
Let her go.

01:10:51.589 --> 01:10:52.963
No!

01:10:56.161 --> 01:10:59.033
No, no, no! No!

01:11:36.434 --> 01:11:39.689
Oh, my God. What happened?

01:11:40.705 --> 01:11:43.074
What the hell are you doing?

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:44.676
Matt!

01:11:45.476 --> 01:11:48.347
You gotta trust me. Just trust me.

01:11:48.847 --> 01:11:51.184
Where are you going?

01:11:51.816 --> 01:11:53.619
Matt!

01:11:53.719 --> 01:11:54.819
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

01:11:54.919 --> 01:11:57.556
- Matt!
- Jesus.

01:12:03.728 --> 01:12:05.998
Call Security!

01:12:17.208 --> 01:12:20.179
It's okay, baby. It's gonna be okay.

01:12:37.462 --> 01:12:41.000
Hang on, baby. Hang on.

01:13:12.997 --> 01:13:15.301
It's okay, sweetheart.

01:13:15.733 --> 01:13:17.904
Hang with me.

01:13:28.079 --> 01:13:31.015
Don't you die on me. Stay with me.

01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:34.353
Come on, now. Come on, sweetheart.

01:13:43.394 --> 01:13:45.264
Come.

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:01.214
Put her here.

01:14:01.479 --> 01:14:04.350
You need to stop this. Now.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.688
I'm finishing up the quemara.

01:14:10.421 --> 01:14:13.493
- Did you get them all?
- Yeah.

01:14:18.029 --> 01:14:20.265
They're all there.

01:14:20.365 --> 01:14:22.801
Look, it's almost dawn.

01:14:23.101 --> 01:14:25.371
You're in time.

01:14:26.471 --> 01:14:29.509
You've got blood on your hands.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:45.323
Here.

01:14:45.423 --> 01:14:47.426
Thank you.

01:14:49.493 --> 01:14:51.764
What's next?

01:15:08.613 --> 01:15:10.214
Why?

01:15:10.314 --> 01:15:14.320
Because, you would never
let your daughter die.

01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:19.929
I must make that decision for you.

01:15:21.826 --> 01:15:24.629
You were never going to destroy the dolls?

01:15:24.729 --> 01:15:27.698
All that's happened since Henry's death,

01:15:27.798 --> 01:15:30.802
what these dolls have caused.

01:15:30.902 --> 01:15:34.240
The bloodshed, the madness...

01:15:35.106 --> 01:15:37.744
your own heartbreak...

01:15:38.176 --> 01:15:40.645
it is my fault.

01:15:41.145 --> 01:15:46.285
It will haunt me the rest of my life,
burden my every day.

01:15:46.484 --> 01:15:49.554
You wanna use them for yourself...

01:15:50.054 --> 01:15:52.924
- to cleanse your own soul.
- No.

01:15:53.224 --> 01:15:56.629
Destroying the dolls was my intention.

01:15:57.495 --> 01:16:00.498
But as I saw their full power...

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:02.266
think of it.

01:16:02.366 --> 01:16:05.970
Henry was the extreme.

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:09.573
His innocence lost before
the dolls could help him.

01:16:09.673 --> 01:16:13.946
But there are countless
innocent children suffering.

01:16:14.378 --> 01:16:17.248
The dolls can help them.

01:16:17.348 --> 01:16:19.918
My daughter will die.

01:16:20.018 --> 01:16:21.452
Yes.

01:16:21.552 --> 01:16:25.791
Yes, so that others can live.

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:31.998
I know how you feel. And I am truly sorry.

01:16:40.971 --> 01:16:44.010
We all have our cross to bear.

01:16:45.042 --> 01:16:46.944
It's almost dawn.

01:16:47.044 --> 01:16:50.750
Be comforted. She'll be at peace soon.

01:18:08.492 --> 01:18:11.295
No. No!

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:13.066
No!

01:18:34.852 --> 01:18:38.456
It's okay, baby. Okay, baby.

01:18:38.556 --> 01:18:40.927
Daddy's here now. Daddy's here.

01:18:58.943 --> 01:19:01.797
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.918
Chloe.

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:12.424
Come on. Come on.

01:19:18.095 --> 01:19:20.766
Come on, come on, baby.

01:20:00.638 --> 01:20:03.242
I wanna keep you, Daddy.

01:20:04.308 --> 01:20:06.944
And I wanna keep you, baby.

01:20:07.044 --> 01:20:08.914
Forever?

01:20:09.914 --> 01:20:12.351
Forever and ever.

01:20:13.117 --> 01:20:15.960
Come here. Let's go.

01:20:33.237 --> 01:20:35.815
Okay, here you go, sweetie.
