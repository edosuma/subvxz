WEBVTT

00:03.300 --> 00:05.838
Thanks for letting Bev play, guys.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.899
I'm not sure who you're talking to.

00:07.900 --> 00:10.009
We didn't want her.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.839
I would have been fine at home,

00:11.840 --> 00:13.719
but Jackie doesn't trust me there.

00:13.720 --> 00:16.039
Mom! I went to check the mail,

00:16.040 --> 00:19.978
and you pulled up half the
carpeting in my bedroom!

00:19.979 --> 00:24.669
Some of these older apartments
have beautiful hardwood floors.

00:24.670 --> 00:27.049
Don't blame me because yours didn't.

00:27.050 --> 00:28.189
Check.

00:28.190 --> 00:31.979
Y'know, you can roll
up a body in a carpet.

00:31.980 --> 00:35.244
Just something to put in
your pocket for later.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.199
You hit bad traffic again?

00:38.200 --> 00:40.039
Getting home later and
later every night.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.919
Yeah. I was stuck on
the Dan Ryan forever.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.699
I know we built that
expressway to honor him,

00:44.700 --> 00:45.909
but all anybody ever says is,

00:45.910 --> 00:48.769
"I was stuck on the
stupid-ass Dan Ryan."

00:48.770 --> 00:50.174
Did the kids get dinner?

00:50.175 --> 00:52.279
For themselves.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.138
They didn't make me anything.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.699
Hey, Jackie, I think Harris lost

00:57.700 --> 00:59.199
one of her good earrings in the couch.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.600
Can you give me a hand looking for it?

01:00.603 --> 01:03.188
I didn't even know Harris
had any good earrings.

01:05.099 --> 01:08.739
She doesn't. Her ears are
constantly infected.

01:08.740 --> 01:10.899
I-I just... I had to talk to somebody.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.150
I'm going crazy.

01:12.156 --> 01:14.169
Oh. Pretend we're looking
through the couch.

01:14.170 --> 01:15.658
What's wrong?

01:15.659 --> 01:17.669
I wasn't on the expressway.

01:17.670 --> 01:19.489
I was at David's.

01:19.490 --> 01:21.649
Well, why would you lie
to your dad about that?

01:21.650 --> 01:24.899
You and David see each other all
the time 'cause of the kids.

01:24.900 --> 01:27.419
Yeah, I know. But...

01:27.420 --> 01:30.169
today, we were making out.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.739
I can't tell my dad that I
was making out with my ex

01:32.740 --> 01:34.260
while I'm also dating Ben.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.679
You and David? When did this start?

01:36.680 --> 01:38.140
The last couple of months.

01:39.020 --> 01:41.189
We just started talking
about the relationship

01:41.190 --> 01:43.144
to see if we could make it work again,

01:43.145 --> 01:44.919
and then tonight, we stopped talking

01:44.920 --> 01:46.640
because our tongues were
in each other's mouths.

01:46.649 --> 01:49.359
But I thought you and
Ben were doing great.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.779
We are.

01:50.780 --> 01:52.639
But, you know, I still
have feelings for David,

01:52.640 --> 01:54.739
and if there's a chance I can
put my family back together,

01:54.740 --> 01:56.032
I have to try, right?

01:56.033 --> 01:57.367
You have to give up Ben.

01:57.368 --> 02:00.995
Why would I do that?

02:00.996 --> 02:03.039
Ben and I are amazing together.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.959
Oh! Oh. It's the classic
wanting of the cake

02:05.960 --> 02:09.127
followed by the ever-present
eating of it, too.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.949
How are... How are you even
having time for all this?

02:11.950 --> 02:14.899
I-I don't. I-I'm like
this close to losing it.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.519
When I'm supposed to be
with David, I'm with Ben.

02:16.520 --> 02:17.939
When I'm supposed to be
with Ben, I'm with David.

02:17.940 --> 02:20.429
When I'm supposed to be with the
kids, I'm with Ben or David.

02:20.430 --> 02:21.724
You know...

02:24.430 --> 02:26.299
... you are right on the verge

02:26.300 --> 02:28.815
of having sex with both of them.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.639
No. No way.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.539
I cannot go any further with David

02:32.540 --> 02:34.509
while I'm still seeing Ben.

02:34.510 --> 02:36.209
I can't sleep with two guys.

02:36.210 --> 02:37.445
I'm not that person.

02:37.446 --> 02:39.119
Let me tell you, I've been that person,

02:39.120 --> 02:40.530
and it can be a nightmare.

02:43.747 --> 02:47.240
A fantastic nightmare.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.199
Hey, guys.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.219
- Hey, preggy.
- Hey, Beck.

02:51.220 --> 02:52.729
- Hey, Becky.
- Hey, hey, li'l mama.

02:52.730 --> 02:54.340
Wow, you're getting big.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.508
Is that baby moving?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.769
Not yet. But she's watching the papers

02:57.770 --> 03:00.350
for a younger uterus in
a better neighborhood.

03:01.470 --> 03:02.515
What's up?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.499
Aunt Jackie asked me to come by

03:04.500 --> 03:07.609
and go over a birth
plan she made for me.

03:07.610 --> 03:10.022
I was expecting a page or two.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.160
I got the Encyclopedia Insanica.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.119
Aunt Jackie's looking for something

03:18.120 --> 03:19.799
to give meaning to her life.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.399
You just happened to be in the station

03:21.400 --> 03:23.059
when the crazy train pulled in.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.372
Tag. You're it.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.584
I'm cashing out.

03:29.585 --> 03:31.829
No way! I've been losing
to her all night!

03:31.830 --> 03:33.439
She wants to leave.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.965
It's a win.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.709
Did you read my birth plan?

03:37.710 --> 03:41.009
I tried. It's just too much.

03:41.010 --> 03:42.594
Can't we just go over this later?

03:42.595 --> 03:44.079
I'm not due for two more months.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.679
But everything in here is important.

03:46.680 --> 03:49.059
Having soft lights and calming music

03:49.060 --> 03:51.049
and putting the baby on your chest

03:51.050 --> 03:53.959
so there's a surge of oxytocin
and she bonds to you.

03:53.960 --> 03:58.479
I've got a whole chapter
on infant car seats.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.139
I just don't know what
all the fuss is about.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.979
In my day, we wrapped
the baby in a napkin

04:03.980 --> 04:06.799
and took it home in our purse.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.122
Mom!

04:08.123 --> 04:11.919
You're confusing it with stealing
muffins from a restaurant.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.269
Hey.

04:14.270 --> 04:17.214
So, that's where all the glasses are.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.802
Yesterday, I had to drink
milk out of a shot glass.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.919
Sorry. I try not to come down here.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.779
It's like a public bathroom at the mall.

04:24.780 --> 04:28.518
You just want to get in and
out and not make eye contact.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.919
Harris, you should be a part of this.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.049
One day, you might have a baby.

04:32.050 --> 04:33.439
You'll want to know this stuff.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.733
Pass. I'm not having any kids.

04:35.734 --> 04:36.939
And why not?

04:36.940 --> 04:38.778
It's a different time, Nana.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.099
You don't have to have a bunch of kids

04:40.100 --> 04:41.198
to give your life meaning.

04:42.660 --> 04:45.439
Good luck getting a man
with that attitude.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.220
Oh, crap! I think I just peed myself.

04:52.480 --> 04:53.835
It's not stopping.

04:53.836 --> 04:57.505
- Becky, I think your water broke.
- Oh, no.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.119
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.093
Oh, really, Becky, it's much too soon!

05:02.094 --> 05:05.930
You never disappoint!

05:05.931 --> 05:08.099
Dan! Dan!

05:08.100 --> 05:10.629
We're heading to the hospital!
Becky's water broke!

05:10.630 --> 05:13.029
Damn. I'll drive. Let's go.

05:13.030 --> 05:15.869
This isn't happening.
I have two more months.

05:15.870 --> 05:17.499
Harris, we don't have time.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.050
Clean that up, would ya?

05:21.470 --> 05:24.580
This is why I don't come down.

"The Conners" is recorded in
front of a live studio audience.

06:08.020 --> 06:10.819
The contractions are getting closer!

06:10.820 --> 06:13.956
Why aren't they taking me in?
We have to stop this.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.819
Dad's getting a nurse.
As soon as he gets one,

06:15.820 --> 06:17.620
they're gonna give you something
to stop the contractions.

06:17.628 --> 06:20.299
And until then, we're gonna do
some visualization exercises

06:20.300 --> 06:21.709
to stay calm. So,

06:21.710 --> 06:24.369
uh... baby doesn't want to come out.

06:24.370 --> 06:26.719
Baby's happy where it is.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.759
The baby is moving like crazy.

06:28.760 --> 06:30.050
- That isn't working.
- Okay,

06:30.057 --> 06:32.839
well, then, we'll... we'll
just talk to the baby.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.399
Uh, uh, sweetheart, hi.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.049
It's your Aunt Jackie and Mommy.

06:36.050 --> 06:39.119
And we just want you to
know there's no rush.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.899
U-Uh, there's no money for college,

06:41.900 --> 06:45.559
and, uh, your daddy's
been deported to Mexico,

06:45.560 --> 06:49.575
and there's alcohol addiction
in your genetic background.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.119
You're freaking the baby out.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.599
Next.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.579
Are you having chest
pains, a sudden rash,

06:55.580 --> 06:56.599
or breathing issues?

06:56.600 --> 06:58.292
All of those, but it's not for me.

06:58.293 --> 07:01.499
My daughter's been sitting
there for 30 minutes.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.132
Her water broke, but the baby's
not due for two more months.

07:04.140 --> 07:05.339
Have her fill this out.

07:05.340 --> 07:07.051
We'll get to her as fast as we can.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.459
No. You take her in,

07:09.460 --> 07:11.399
and I'll fill out the forms
while she's in there.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.307
I want somebody to see her now.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.726
Forms first. Care second.

07:15.727 --> 07:19.481
How about I wheel her back
there and you try and stop me?

07:20.360 --> 07:21.859
Orderly?

07:21.860 --> 07:24.580
Take the geriatric pregnancy
into a room, please.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.280
"Geriatric"?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.849
You are so lucky that I can't
get up and come over there,

07:30.850 --> 07:33.539
'cause a baby would fall out of me.

07:37.670 --> 07:38.999
Hey.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.819
You didn't have to come in.

07:40.820 --> 07:42.509
You were at the hospital all night.

07:42.510 --> 07:43.579
I missed you.

07:43.580 --> 07:44.699
I missed you, too.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.632
- Mm.
- How's Becky?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.559
Uh, they're still waiting to see

07:48.560 --> 07:50.919
if the medication'll stop the
contractions completely.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.539
My dad and Jackie are there.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.359
Actually, I looked over some
stuff in the waiting room.

07:55.360 --> 07:58.728
There is a typo in the proofs.

07:58.729 --> 08:02.059
Mm, my work doesn't have typos.

08:04.220 --> 08:07.959
Oh. Um, could you do me a huge favor

08:07.960 --> 08:09.799
and run down to the coffee shop

08:09.800 --> 08:11.820
and get me another cup
of coffee with agave?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.439
And on the off chance

08:13.440 --> 08:15.619
that Cup 'O Mud doesn't have agave,

08:15.620 --> 08:18.414
is there another exotic
plant that you'll accept?

08:18.415 --> 08:20.875
Uh, yes, I'll take black tar heroin.

08:20.876 --> 08:22.370
Got it.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.839
Hey, David.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.940
Uh, I'm at work. What's up?

08:29.920 --> 08:32.219
Yeah, yeah. That would be really sweet.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.558
I-I'll come by and pick you up,

08:33.559 --> 08:35.431
and we can both go to
the hospital together.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.849
Okay. Love you, too.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.890
... Daddy.

08:41.559 --> 08:45.150
I've never heard you call
your dad "Daddy" before.

08:45.170 --> 08:47.679
Yeah, I'm feeling very
fragile right now.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.650
- I need my daddy.
- Oh.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.239
I, uh, just forgot the wallet.
I'll be right back.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.279
Uh, you know what?

08:53.280 --> 08:55.368
I-I don't need another cup.
I'm already vibrating.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.959
All right. I gotta be honest.

08:57.960 --> 09:01.659
I am worried about you.

09:01.660 --> 09:04.140
You look exhausted.

09:05.190 --> 09:08.547
Yeah, it's that stupid-ass Dan
Ryan. That's the problem.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.499
Well, we both know what the solution is.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.302
You move in with me.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.019
You know those signs that
say "If you lived here,

09:16.020 --> 09:19.679
you'd be home and having
sex with Ben by now"?

09:19.680 --> 09:23.429
You'd be home and having
sex with Ben by now.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.579
I love you, you know,

09:24.580 --> 09:26.690
but I just really can't
think about this right now.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.779
Okay. Tabled for another time.

09:28.780 --> 09:31.049
At least let me just drive
you back to the hospital,

09:31.050 --> 09:32.070
keep you company.

09:32.090 --> 09:33.299
U-Uh, no. You know what?

09:33.300 --> 09:34.589
That's so sweet,

09:34.590 --> 09:36.659
but it's just too many
people at the hospital.

09:36.660 --> 09:40.280
When you're expecting a preemie,
they give you a smaller room.

09:44.793 --> 09:45.949
How's Aunt Becky?

09:45.950 --> 09:47.199
Oh, pretty much the same.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.699
I'm just gonna grab some stuff for her

09:48.700 --> 09:50.131
and run back to the hospital.

09:50.132 --> 09:52.509
Okay. Want me to save
you some kale salad?

09:55.840 --> 09:59.680
Listen, let me tell you about kale.

10:00.580 --> 10:03.149
In the old days, you'd
go to the cafeteria,

10:03.150 --> 10:04.279
and it was the green stuff

10:04.280 --> 10:06.648
that kept the ice from
touching the cottage cheese.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.160
It's all hype!

10:09.170 --> 10:12.319
You don't go from garnish to superfood.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.989
I feel so stupid. I fell for it.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.989
Coming! Coming!

10:21.360 --> 10:22.720
Coming!

10:24.420 --> 10:26.500
Hi. How can I help you?

10:26.501 --> 10:29.170
I'm looking for Harris Healy's mother.

10:29.171 --> 10:32.109
She's not home from work yet,
but I'm Harris' grandfather.

10:32.110 --> 10:33.382
What can I do for you?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.719
Your granddaughter goes
to school with my son,

10:35.720 --> 10:38.346
and she sold him a homemade pot cookie.

10:39.480 --> 10:40.939
Okay.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.939
I can kind of believe she sold him pot,

10:42.940 --> 10:46.313
but I do not believe she baked anything.

10:47.190 --> 10:48.640
Believe it.

10:48.650 --> 10:51.029
Kyle freaked out, and I was up all night

10:51.030 --> 10:55.237
trying to reassure him that
time wasn't standing still.

10:55.238 --> 10:58.299
Yeah, that stuff does get on top of you.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.669
Listen, I'm really sorry.

10:59.670 --> 11:02.661
We would never want that
to happen to any kid.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.119
You tell her I had to
take him to urgent care.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.379
I'm out 200 bucks,

11:06.380 --> 11:09.127
and I need it to pay
for my tattoo removal.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.439
So, my new husband

11:13.440 --> 11:15.779
can't handle looking at my ex's face

11:15.780 --> 11:17.570
while he's behind me.

11:19.640 --> 11:22.859
Uh... your first husband...

11:22.860 --> 11:24.940
liked looking at his own face?

11:26.530 --> 11:28.979
It was a red flag I ignored, okay?

11:28.980 --> 11:32.049
I'm really sorry. I-I can't
help you with the money.

11:32.050 --> 11:33.060
I don't have it.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.279
All right, well, maybe
I'll just take something

11:35.280 --> 11:36.860
worth 200 bucks.

11:45.960 --> 11:49.080
I'll come back when the mother's home.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.419
- Hey.
- Are you Harris Healy's mother?

11:53.420 --> 11:55.382
'Cause if you are, you owe me money.

11:55.383 --> 11:57.539
Nope.

11:57.540 --> 12:00.329
Well, tell her I'll be back.

12:00.330 --> 12:03.932
I will. You have a blessed day!

12:05.200 --> 12:06.849
What the hell was that all about?

12:06.850 --> 12:08.399
You got a problem.
Your daughter's selling

12:08.400 --> 12:09.979
pot cookies at school.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.119
What?

12:11.120 --> 12:12.139
How come when I get home,

12:12.140 --> 12:14.409
it's never "Somebody got a scholarship"?

12:14.410 --> 12:15.526
Where's Harris?

12:15.527 --> 12:16.529
At the hospital.

12:20.170 --> 12:21.239
Damn.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.349
- What's wrong?
- They couldn't stop the labor.

12:23.350 --> 12:24.577
The baby's coming now.

12:26.340 --> 12:27.459
All right, we gotta get going

12:27.460 --> 12:30.200
before Bev wraps it in a napkin
and puts it in her purse.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.169
Okay, just one more push.

12:40.170 --> 12:41.269
I can't!

12:41.270 --> 12:44.054
You can. It's a preemie. It's small!

12:44.055 --> 12:46.557
One more push.

12:49.311 --> 12:50.853
Oh, my God, she's here!

12:50.854 --> 12:52.730
Nurse.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.449
Is she okay?

12:54.450 --> 12:55.899
Why isn't she crying?

12:55.900 --> 12:57.979
You did great. Just rest for a second.

12:57.980 --> 12:59.769
Why aren't they putting her on my chest?

12:59.770 --> 13:01.099
This is exactly what's
supposed to happen.

13:01.100 --> 13:02.448
They're gonna take her to the NICU.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.529
I wanna see her.

13:03.530 --> 13:05.239
Just let them do their jobs. It's okay.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.410
Does she look normal?

13:06.411 --> 13:07.870
Yes!

13:07.871 --> 13:09.839
Then why can't I see her?

13:09.840 --> 13:11.549
Because she's very small.

13:11.550 --> 13:14.294
She can't be seen by the naked eye.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.239
This is all my fault.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.579
I'm too old. I drank too much.

13:20.580 --> 13:23.177
That's why she was born too early.

13:23.178 --> 13:25.554
No, come on. Don't do that, Becky.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.579
You know what... I-I did
everything right with Harris,

13:27.580 --> 13:28.959
and she was a preemie.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.684
And she turned out fine.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.179
No, she didn't!

13:38.880 --> 13:41.159
The County ER always reminds me

13:41.160 --> 13:43.699
of that scene in "Gone With the Wind"

13:43.700 --> 13:45.699
with all the Confederate soldiers

13:45.700 --> 13:48.203
laying on the ground, dying.

13:49.570 --> 13:51.121
Frankly...

13:51.122 --> 13:55.502
I didn't care for the cursing
at the end of that movie.

13:56.510 --> 13:59.239
Okay. Baby's here.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.295
Are Becky and the baby okay?

14:01.296 --> 14:04.299
Becky's fine. Uh, the baby
wasn't breathing on her own,

14:04.300 --> 14:06.469
but they put her on a ventilator,
and now she's stable.

14:06.470 --> 14:07.638
Thank God.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.264
Can we go back there now?

14:09.265 --> 14:10.789
Uh, Becky's pretty upset,

14:10.790 --> 14:12.789
but she's got Jackie in there with her,

14:12.790 --> 14:14.229
so it's gonna get worse.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.599
Uh, you're not going anywhere.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.732
What?

14:18.733 --> 14:20.959
You're selling pot cookies at school?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.277
Are... Are you stupid?

14:22.278 --> 14:24.238
Are we really gonna do this right here?

14:24.239 --> 14:25.299
Yes, we are.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.783
Kyle's mom came by. She had
to take him to urgent care.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.960
I told him "half a cookie."

14:30.912 --> 14:34.619
This is not about Kyle's
inability to maintain.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.501
This is about you selling drugs.

14:36.502 --> 14:38.419
Oh, my God. They're gonna be selling pot

14:38.420 --> 14:40.359
to everybody here in three months.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.449
Nobody cares.

14:41.450 --> 14:43.089
And it's not like I'm eating it.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.319
Wh... Hey.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.619
You cannot eat it, you can't sell it,

14:46.620 --> 14:47.789
and you're underage.

14:47.790 --> 14:49.803
And by the way, who are
you getting weed from?

14:49.804 --> 14:52.379
It's everywhere. Everybody's selling it.

14:52.380 --> 14:54.959
Honestly, it's kind of amazing
that I'm doing so well.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.669
My hustle is putting it in
cookies and adding cardamom.

14:57.670 --> 15:00.107
It's exotic and a little unexpected.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.639
You're actually bragging about this?

15:02.640 --> 15:04.769
Do you realize if Kyle's
mom had called the cops,

15:04.770 --> 15:06.699
you'd be sitting in jail right now?

15:06.700 --> 15:07.759
You know what... you're gonna give me

15:07.760 --> 15:08.799
all the money you made from this,

15:08.800 --> 15:10.099
I'm taking your phone away,

15:10.100 --> 15:12.579
and you're not leaving the house
for the rest of the semester.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.460
Oh, wow. I'm grounded.

15:14.470 --> 15:16.219
Like you're gonna know if I'm even home.

15:16.220 --> 15:18.334
You're never around.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.359
You really think it hurts me

15:20.360 --> 15:22.179
pointing out that I'm not a good mother?

15:22.180 --> 15:24.749
Like water off a duck's back, baby.

15:32.580 --> 15:34.319
Bev?

15:34.320 --> 15:36.269
Yes, Dan?

15:36.270 --> 15:37.979
It's been a long day,

15:37.980 --> 15:40.589
so please don't take this the wrong way.

15:40.590 --> 15:43.567
But why are you here?

15:43.568 --> 15:46.863
Everybody's gotta be somewhere.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.039
I've had a crappy day.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.550
Becky was afraid to see the baby.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.869
Now she wants to, so I gotta
go back to the hospital.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.579
There's pie. I got enough for everybody.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.139
God bless ya!

15:57.140 --> 15:59.289
I was wondering where you were.

15:59.290 --> 16:01.239
I'm only asking 'cause it's...

16:01.240 --> 16:04.899
just been me and Bev here for hours.

16:04.900 --> 16:07.090
Hours.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.719
Did you know that when Jackie was born,

16:09.720 --> 16:13.681
she caused my bladder
to drop into my vagina?

16:18.186 --> 16:21.169
You had to say that now, didn't you?

16:21.170 --> 16:23.340
Oh, I'm not gonna let
you ruin this for me.

16:26.680 --> 16:29.009
No offense, Dan,

16:29.010 --> 16:31.669
but I don't like to watch you eat.

16:31.670 --> 16:33.160
Ohh!

16:37.200 --> 16:40.410
You enjoying that pie, Dad?
Smells great, huh?

16:40.416 --> 16:41.419
Yep.

16:41.420 --> 16:44.119
Love the smell of apple pie.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.599
So, you can smell apple
pie, but you can't smell

16:46.600 --> 16:49.210
the smell of pot cookies
baking in your own house?

16:49.217 --> 16:50.425
What?

16:50.426 --> 16:52.469
H-How did you not know
what Harris was doing?

16:52.470 --> 16:53.479
Whoa.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.098
You're gonna blame your
kid selling drugs on me?

16:56.099 --> 16:58.392
Yes, I am, because
you're here and I'm not.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.269
- Whose fault is that?
- I'm working!

17:00.270 --> 17:03.139
Are you? 'Cause you're
getting home at 10:00.

17:03.140 --> 17:05.279
I don't know if you're with
Ben or what you're doing,

17:05.280 --> 17:06.999
but you're definitely not
coming straight home

17:07.000 --> 17:08.059
from work every night.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.858
Oh, so I'm not allowed
to have a personal life?

17:09.859 --> 17:11.648
Because I remember when I was a kid,

17:11.650 --> 17:13.699
you'd go straight from
work to the Lobo Lounge,

17:13.700 --> 17:15.499
you'd have a beer, then you'd come home

17:15.500 --> 17:16.858
and you'd say, "There's my girls!"

17:16.859 --> 17:17.990
DJ would start crying,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.910
and you'd go to the
garage to fix a bike.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.638
Hey, I worked my ass off day and night

17:23.640 --> 17:24.799
to support this family,

17:24.800 --> 17:27.510
and I was always there when it counted.

17:28.430 --> 17:30.966
You need to get your head in
the game and raise your kids.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.339
I already raised mine.

17:32.340 --> 17:34.139
Oh, did you, though? 'Cause
I'm pretty sure it's Mom

17:34.140 --> 17:35.390
that raised us.

17:36.347 --> 17:37.739
No.

17:37.740 --> 17:39.760
If we're gonna be honest, the TV did.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.483
How's she doing?

17:48.484 --> 17:51.153
Hi. Uh...

17:51.154 --> 17:52.159
Oh, every now and then,

17:52.160 --> 17:54.239
when she's trying to
move her little arms,

17:54.240 --> 17:56.109
she punches herself in the head.

17:56.110 --> 17:57.679
She's definitely a Conner.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.179
Oh, wow.

17:59.180 --> 18:01.699
Another Conner in the world.

18:01.700 --> 18:05.439
What we don't have in quality,
we make up in volume.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.210
Darn right we do.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.714
Grammy Becky's here to see her baby.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.591
Are you ready?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.310
I think so.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.449
Oh, my God.

18:18.450 --> 18:20.350
She's so tiny.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.479
Look at all the tubes.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.319
I know it looks scary, but
all those things in there

18:25.320 --> 18:27.250
are helping her get stronger.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.909
She's looking at me.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.659
Yeah, of course she is. You're her mom.

18:34.660 --> 18:36.157
I'm her mom.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.819
Have you decided on a name yet?

18:39.820 --> 18:42.659
You know, the name "Jacqueline"
means "May God protect."

18:42.660 --> 18:46.250
We could call her Jackie Jr.
That'd be so cute, right?

18:47.210 --> 18:50.119
Her name is Beverly Rose.

18:50.120 --> 18:53.559
I wanted a connection with the family.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.051
Becky, um...

18:55.920 --> 18:57.669
I want you to know

18:57.670 --> 19:00.299
that I will always love this baby.

19:00.300 --> 19:03.569
But I consider it a personal attack

19:03.570 --> 19:06.719
and a negation of my
entire childhood of pain

19:06.720 --> 19:09.079
that you have named this precious angel

19:09.080 --> 19:12.099
after the vessel of
evil that is my mother.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.770
'Nuff said.

19:15.690 --> 19:16.699
Come on, Deej.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.699
Let's let these two get to
know each other better.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.879
You need anything?

19:19.880 --> 19:21.610
No. We're fine.

19:22.980 --> 19:24.849
Love you, sis.

19:24.850 --> 19:26.440
Thanks.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.870
I'm so sorry.

19:56.230 --> 19:58.699
See? It's even better
when you wait for it.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.229
I'm gonna go get the pizza.

20:01.530 --> 20:02.826
What?!

20:02.827 --> 20:05.412
Was that naked man in your bed David?

20:05.413 --> 20:06.899
Shh! Yes!

20:06.900 --> 20:08.123
What are you doing here?

20:08.124 --> 20:09.799
I needed a night away from Bev.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.239
Well, this is great. You
finally made a decision.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.670
You broke up with Ben.

20:13.671 --> 20:16.959
Well, that sure would
have made things simpler.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.479
Wait.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.279
You're sleeping with both of them?

20:20.280 --> 20:22.134
I thought you weren't
that kind of person.

20:22.135 --> 20:23.239
Well, apparently I am.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.889
I set a boundary, and I crossed it.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.299
I'm so stupid. Why did I do that?

20:27.300 --> 20:28.769
You gotta help me, Jackie.

20:28.770 --> 20:30.299
Well, I...

20:30.300 --> 20:32.429
If somebody took Ben off your hands,

20:32.430 --> 20:34.608
would that help?

20:34.609 --> 20:35.969
Stay away from him!

20:35.970 --> 20:36.985
Okay!

20:36.986 --> 20:38.229
Good night!

20:42.170 --> 20:44.284
A brand-new Conner.

20:44.285 --> 20:47.099
Let's learn from the
mistakes of our past.

20:47.100 --> 20:48.449
Oh, I agree.

20:48.450 --> 20:50.399
You know what... let's raise
her to expect nothing,

20:50.400 --> 20:52.501
so she's never disappointed.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.795
Or we can tell her she can
be whatever she wants to be.

20:54.796 --> 20:57.409
That's a mean joke to play on a baby.

20:57.410 --> 21:00.439
Wait. What if we never
tell her she's a Conner,

21:00.440 --> 21:02.949
but we'll raise her like Moses...

21:02.950 --> 21:03.959
or Tarzan!

21:03.960 --> 21:05.889
Oh, yeah. Like Tarzan.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.469
But instead of holding on to a vine,

21:07.470 --> 21:09.249
she can hold on to a job.

21:09.250 --> 21:10.599
Quick... let's go tell Becky

21:10.600 --> 21:12.300
before she fills out
the birth certificate.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.600
This is for when you come home.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.209
You no Tarzan. You Conner.
