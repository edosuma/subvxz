TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:35.567 --> 00:36.400
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.400 --> 00:36.900
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:36.900 --> 00:38.233
FOR JOINING US.

00:38.233 --> 00:39.433
WE HAVE BEEN AWAY FOR MOST

00:39.433 --> 00:40.600
OF JULY.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.367

00:58.100 --> 01:00.100
I AM SENIOR ADVISER TO PRESIDENT

01:01.934 --> 01:03.834
WHEN MY FATHER-IN-LAW DECIDED TO

01:03.834 --> 01:06.000

I TOLD YOU, AND YOU WOULDN'T

THAT HAPPENED ON MONDAY.

01:20.033 --> 01:21.000

BE BENDING THE SPACE-TIME

01:25.433 --> 01:27.000
CONTINUUM IN ORDER TO FILL

01:27.000 --> 01:28.734
A WEEK WITH MORE NEWS THAN IT

01:28.734 --> 01:30.800
CAN SCIENTIFICALLY CONTAIN.

01:30.800 --> 01:31.934
AND THIS WEEK MAY'VE ACTUALLY

01:31.934 --> 01:32.967
BEEN NOTABLE NOT JUST FOR

01:32.967 --> 01:34.166
THE TERRIBLE THINGS TRUMP TRIED

01:34.166 --> 01:35.800
TO DO BUT FOR HOW TERRIBLY

01:35.800 --> 01:37.600
HE TRIED TO DO THEM.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.367
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED ON WEDNESDAY

01:38.367 --> 01:39.834
MORNING.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.400
>> A POLICY PRONOUNCEMENT

01:41.400 --> 01:42.000
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF

01:42.000 --> 01:43.433
THE UNITED STATES.

01:43.433 --> 01:45.066
HE JUST TOOK A MAJOR STANCE,

01:45.066 --> 01:46.533
SAYING THAT HE WILL BAN

01:46.533 --> 01:48.700
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE FROM SERVING

01:48.700 --> 01:51.400
IN THE U.S. MILITARY.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.033
>> John: LOOK, THAT'S AS HATEFUL

01:53.033 --> 01:56.066
AS IT IS POINTLESS.

01:56.066 --> 01:57.500
WE MAY BE ENTERING THE MAD LIBS

01:57.500 --> 01:59.700
PORTION OF TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY,

01:59.700 --> 02:00.300
WHERE HE PERSECUTES GROUPS

02:00.300 --> 02:01.400
AT RANDOM.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.033
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE BANNED

02:02.033 --> 02:03.300
FROM THE MILITARY.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.433
PACIFIC ISLANDERS CAN NO LONGER

02:04.433 --> 02:06.667
USE THE POSTAL SERVICE.

02:06.667 --> 02:07.467
AND JEWS CAN NO LONGER

02:07.467 --> 02:08.800
HIGH-FIVE.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.467
SORRY, JEWS.

02:11.467 --> 02:13.300
AND TO MAKE THIS EVEN WORSE,

02:13.300 --> 02:14.433
TRUMP NOT ONLY ANNOUNCED THIS

02:14.433 --> 02:15.900
POLICY OVER TWITTER, BUT ACROSS

02:15.900 --> 02:18.000
THREE TWEETS, THE FIRST OF WHICH

02:18.000 --> 02:19.266
READ, "AFTER CONSULTATION

02:19.266 --> 02:20.166
WITH MY GENERALS AND MILITARY

02:20.166 --> 02:21.500
EXPERTS, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT

02:21.500 --> 02:22.667
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

02:22.667 --> 02:25.233
WILL NOT ACCEPT OR ALLOW..."

02:25.233 --> 02:26.133
THEN THERE WAS A NINE-MINUTE

02:26.133 --> 02:28.934
GAP, PRESUMABLY WHILE

02:28.934 --> 02:30.000
HE FINISHED HIS BREAKFAST OF

02:30.000 --> 02:30.967
DEEP FRIED BIG MACS

02:30.967 --> 02:32.867
AND MASHED DORITOS.

02:32.867 --> 02:34.333
AND ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT,

02:34.333 --> 02:35.400
EVEN HIS OWN GENERALS WERE

02:35.400 --> 02:36.900
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE

02:36.900 --> 02:38.567
COMING NEXT.

02:38.567 --> 02:40.033
>> IT WAS REPORTED THAT GENERALS

02:40.033 --> 02:41.300
AT THE PENTAGON WERE NERVOUS FOR

02:41.300 --> 02:42.066
NINE MINUTES UNTIL THE SECOND

02:42.066 --> 02:43.800
TWEET CAME OUT, BECAUSE THEY

02:43.800 --> 02:44.667
THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT MIGHT BE

02:44.667 --> 02:47.033
DECLARING WAR ON NORTH KOREA.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.133
THAT'S A PRETTY SCARY THOUGHT.

02:49.133 --> 02:50.000
>> John: A "PRETTY" SCARY

02:50.000 --> 02:50.867
THOUGHT?

02:50.867 --> 02:51.433
NO.

02:51.433 --> 02:52.200
DONALD TRUMP DECLARING WAR

02:52.200 --> 02:53.767
ON NORTH KOREA WITH A TWEET

02:53.767 --> 02:54.900
IS THE SCARIEST TEN CONSECUTIVE

02:54.900 --> 02:57.300
WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE,

02:57.300 --> 02:58.433
AND I'M INCLUDING ON THAT LIST:

02:58.433 --> 02:59.800
"A CLOWN WAITS FOR YOU IN YOUR

02:59.800 --> 03:01.700
HOUSE, SOFTLY WHISTLING,"

03:01.700 --> 03:04.000
AND "SHARKS CAN FLY NOW,

03:04.000 --> 03:05.867
AND THEY KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE."

03:05.867 --> 03:07.300
AND AS THE MILITARY SOON

03:07.300 --> 03:08.233
INFORMED THE PRESIDENT,

03:08.233 --> 03:09.533
IT DOESN'T TAKE ITS MARCHING

03:09.533 --> 03:11.700
ORDERS FROM FUCKING TWITTER.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.433
>> GENERAL JOSEPH DUNFORD SAID

03:13.433 --> 03:15.667
"THERE WILL BE NO MODIFICATION

03:15.667 --> 03:17.133
TO THE CURRENT POLICY UNTIL

03:17.133 --> 03:18.033
THE ORDER GOES THROUGH

03:18.033 --> 03:19.667
THE PROPER CHANNELS."

03:19.667 --> 03:20.834
>> John: EXACTLY.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.200
THE MILITARY NEEDS INSTRUCTIONS

03:22.200 --> 03:23.133
DELIVERED THROUGH THE PROPER

03:23.133 --> 03:24.367
CHAIN OF COMMAND.

03:24.367 --> 03:27.000
YOU CAN'T CHANGE POLICY OVER

03:27.000 --> 03:27.467
THE SAME CHANNELS THAT

03:27.467 --> 03:29.300
JUSTIN BIEBER ONCE USED TO TWEET

03:29.300 --> 03:30.600
"RANDOM SHOUT-OUT TO ALL MY SEXY

03:30.600 --> 03:31.934
LADIES.

03:31.934 --> 03:34.300
HAHA."

03:34.300 --> 03:36.166
MEANWHILE, THERE WAS ALSO

03:36.166 --> 03:37.233
A DEVELOPMENT REGARDING

03:37.233 --> 03:38.867
THE REPEAL OF OBAMACARE,

03:38.867 --> 03:40.300
WHICH, REMEMBER, WAS A SIGNATURE

03:40.300 --> 03:41.166
GOAL FOR DONALD TRUMP'S

03:41.166 --> 03:42.300
PRESIDENCY, ALONG WITH,

03:42.300 --> 03:43.533
PRESUMABLY, PASSING

03:43.533 --> 03:44.066
COMPREHENSIVE

03:44.066 --> 03:46.767
PRO-DAUGHTER-DATING LEGISLATION

03:46.767 --> 03:47.867
AND GETTING TO SECOND BASE

03:47.867 --> 03:49.567
WITH A TRUCK.

03:49.567 --> 03:51.033
WELL, THIS WEEK, THE REPEAL

03:51.033 --> 03:51.700
RAN AGROUND

03:51.700 --> 03:54.333
IN SPECTACULAR FASHION.

03:54.333 --> 03:55.433
>> THE G.O.P. DRIVE TO APPEAL

03:55.433 --> 03:56.900
OBAMACARE FELL APART

03:56.900 --> 04:00.333
AT 1:29 A.M. EASTERN TIME.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.767
>> MR. McCAIN.

04:01.767 --> 04:02.433
>> WHEN ARIZONA SENATOR

04:02.433 --> 04:03.700
JOHN McCAIN FLASHED

04:03.700 --> 04:07.700
A THUMBS-DOWN,

04:07.700 --> 04:09.567
DRAWING GASPS AND SOME APPLAUSE

04:09.567 --> 04:11.300
FROM DEMOCRATS.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.467

04:12.467 --> 04:13.633
A GROUP OF SENATORS BREAK INTO

04:13.633 --> 04:14.667
SPONTANEOUS APPLAUSE LIKE THAT

04:14.667 --> 04:15.934
SINCE EVERY TIME TED CRUZ

04:15.934 --> 04:18.300
LEAVES A ROOM.

04:18.300 --> 04:23.800
OH, HE'S GOING.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.200
McCAIN'S VOTE WAS AN INCREDIBLY

04:25.200 --> 04:26.300
DRAMATIC MOMENT, ALTHOUGH CNN

04:26.300 --> 04:28.300
COULDN'T HELP TRYING TO AMP UP

04:28.300 --> 04:29.900
THE DRAMA EVEN MORE.

04:29.900 --> 04:32.000
>> 1:29 A.M., SENATOR McCAIN

04:32.000 --> 04:34.100
RE-ENTERS THE CHAMBER.

04:34.100 --> 04:34.800
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER

04:34.800 --> 04:36.400
MITCH MCCONNELL STANDS AT THE

04:36.400 --> 04:37.967
FRONT OF THE ROOM LIKE HE HAD

04:37.967 --> 04:39.934
MOST OF THE NIGHT.

04:39.934 --> 04:41.667
McCAIN WAVES HIS HAND TO GET THE

04:41.667 --> 04:43.500
ATTENTION OF THE SENATE CLERK,

04:43.500 --> 04:45.633
PAUSES FOR JUST A MOMENT,

04:45.633 --> 04:46.467
AND GIVES A DRAMATIC

04:46.467 --> 04:48.133
THUMBS-DOWN.

04:48.133 --> 04:49.000
SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN

04:49.000 --> 04:51.633
LEANS IN TO GET A BETTER LOOK

04:51.633 --> 04:54.400

04:54.400 --> 04:56.200
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN,

04:56.200 --> 04:58.300
A SINGLE, ASSERTIVE CLAP.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.567

05:02.166 --> 05:03.000
HOW AN OMNISCIENT GOD COULD BE

05:03.000 --> 05:04.467
SO CRUEL, WHILE SENATOR

05:04.467 --> 05:05.700
CLAIRE McCASKILL DOES SOMETHING

05:05.700 --> 05:07.433
THAT LOOKS LIKE THE MACARENA

05:07.433 --> 05:09.567
AND THE GHOST OF STROM THURMOND

05:09.567 --> 05:10.633
CARVES A RACIAL EPITHET INTO A

05:10.633 --> 05:12.033
WOODEN DESK USING THE BLUNTED

05:12.033 --> 05:15.100
EDGE OF A MECHANICAL PENCIL."

05:15.100 --> 05:16.533
BUT ALL THIS DRAMA SOMEHOW TOOK

05:16.533 --> 05:18.333
A BACK SEAT THIS WEEK TO THE ONE

05:18.333 --> 05:19.834
UNFOLDING WITHIN THE WHITE

05:19.834 --> 05:21.033
HOUSE, WHERE BOTH

05:21.033 --> 05:22.533
SEAN SPICER AND REINCE PREIBUS

05:22.533 --> 05:23.734
HAVE RESIGNED, FOLLOWING THE

05:23.734 --> 05:24.867
APPOINTMENT AS COMMUNICATIONS

05:24.867 --> 05:27.667
DIRECTOR OF ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI,

05:27.667 --> 05:28.967
A FORMER HEDGE-FUNDER

05:28.967 --> 05:29.900
AND "LONG ISLANDER OF

05:29.900 --> 05:31.300
THE FRICKIN' MONTH"

05:31.300 --> 05:34.633
FOR 643 MONTHS IN A ROW.

05:34.633 --> 05:35.767
SCARAMUCCI'S NICKNAME IS

05:35.767 --> 05:37.667
"THE MOOCH," WHICH ALREADY

05:37.667 --> 05:39.066
SOUNDS LIKE THE NAME

05:39.066 --> 05:41.533
OF A COW STD.

05:41.533 --> 05:42.867
"SO, NEITHER ONE OF US HAS BEEN

05:42.867 --> 05:44.133
WITH ANYONE ELSE.

05:44.133 --> 05:45.300
AND YET SOMEHOW I HAVE

05:45.300 --> 05:47.433
THE MOOCH.

05:47.433 --> 05:48.166
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT

05:48.166 --> 05:50.734
TO TELL ME?"

05:50.734 --> 05:52.667
ANYWAY, "TONY MOOCH" WASTED

05:52.667 --> 05:53.734
NO TIME CRACKING DOWN

05:53.734 --> 05:55.367
ON LEAKERS, GOING ON CNN

05:55.367 --> 05:56.400
TO EXPLAIN HIS PHILOSOPHY

05:56.400 --> 05:59.300
WITH AN UNEXPECTED REFERENCE.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.500
>> WHY DON'T YOU HONOR THE JOB?

06:00.500 --> 06:01.200
YOU REMEMBER JOE PATERNO?

06:01.200 --> 06:02.400
WHAT WOULD HE SAY?

06:02.400 --> 06:03.433
"ACT LIKE YOU'VE BEEN THERE

06:03.433 --> 06:05.166
BEFORE.

06:05.166 --> 06:07.400
ACT WITH HONOR AND DIGNITY."

06:07.400 --> 06:09.200
>> John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

06:09.200 --> 06:10.100
IT'S A LITTLE LOADED QUOTING

06:10.100 --> 06:12.567
JOE PATERNO, PARTICULARLY IN THE

06:12.567 --> 06:13.967
CONTEXT OF "EVERYONE NEEDS

06:13.967 --> 06:15.900
TO KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT."

06:15.900 --> 06:17.433
AND THE CRAZY THING IS, THAT

06:17.433 --> 06:18.000
WHOLE "ACT LIKE YOU'VE BEEN

06:18.000 --> 06:19.200
THERE" QUOTE HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED

06:19.200 --> 06:20.600
TO MULTIPLE COACHES,

06:20.600 --> 06:22.533
INCLUDING VINCE LOMBARDI.

06:22.533 --> 06:24.300
AND YET THE MOOCH STILL PICKED

06:24.300 --> 06:26.000
THE GUY WITH A "CHILD SEX ABUSE

06:26.000 --> 06:27.633
SCANDAL AND DISMISSAL" SECTION

06:27.633 --> 06:29.667
ON HIS WIKIPEDIA PAGE,

06:29.667 --> 06:31.100
WHICH IS JUST WEIRD.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.633
IF YOU WERE PREGNANT AND SOMEONE

06:32.633 --> 06:33.467
ASKED YOU IF YOU KNEW THE SEX

06:33.467 --> 06:35.100
OF THE BABY, YOUR RESPONSE

06:35.100 --> 06:37.200
WOULDN'T BE, "LIKE CASEY ANTHONY

06:37.200 --> 06:47.166
ONCE SAID: IT'S A GIRL!"

06:47.166 --> 06:49.633
>> THAT WOULD'VE BEEN THE

06:49.633 --> 06:50.233
CRAZIEST THING SCARAMUCCI SAID

06:50.233 --> 06:53.633
UNTIL THIS.

06:53.633 --> 06:57.500
>> WHITE HOUSE MEDICATIONS

06:57.500 --> 06:58.867
DIRECTOR ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI

06:58.867 --> 07:02.767
UNLOADED ON THE CHIEF OF STAFF.

07:02.767 --> 07:03.467
>> AND THIS WAS THE MOST

07:03.467 --> 07:04.000
DISGUSTING THING HE SAID.

07:04.000 --> 07:04.734
"I'M NOT STEVE BANNON.

07:04.734 --> 07:05.367
I'M NOT TRYING TO BLANK

07:05.367 --> 07:06.000
MY OWN BLANK.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.834
>> John: "SUCK MY OWN COCK."

07:06.834 --> 07:07.934
SCARAMUCCI SAID,

07:07.934 --> 07:08.967
"I'M NOT STEVE BANNON.

07:08.967 --> 07:09.800
I'M NOT TRYING TO SUCK MY OWN

07:09.800 --> 07:10.300
COCK."

07:10.300 --> 07:11.166
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

07:11.166 --> 07:12.066
TO A REPORTER.

07:12.066 --> 07:13.467
ON THE RECORD.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.633
THERE'S JUST NO POINT IN ANYONE

07:14.633 --> 07:17.200
BEING COY ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.033
IN FACT, SCARAMUCCI'S REMARKS

07:18.033 --> 07:19.300
WERE SO EXTREME, THEY PUT NEWS

07:19.300 --> 07:21.834
NETWORKS IN A TRICKY POSITION.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.367
BUT LEAVE IT TO GAYLE KING

07:23.367 --> 07:25.033
ON "CBS THIS MORNING"

07:25.033 --> 07:27.500
TO CUT RIGHT TO THE CHASE.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.533
>> HOW IS THAT EVEN PHYSICALLY

07:28.533 --> 07:30.166
POSSIBLE, NUMBER ONE?

07:30.166 --> 07:31.700
AND NUMBER TWO, WHEN YOU HEAR

07:31.700 --> 07:33.133
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BOB,

07:33.133 --> 07:34.333
ARE YOU OFFENDED?

07:34.333 --> 07:35.033
ARE YOU OFFENDED

07:35.033 --> 07:36.266
OR ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED?

07:36.266 --> 07:37.867
ARE YOU SADDENED BY IT?

07:37.867 --> 07:38.800
>> John: SHE'S TALKING TO

07:38.800 --> 07:41.066
BOB SCHIEFFER.

07:41.066 --> 07:42.600
AND NOTHING IN HIS HALF-CENTURY

07:42.600 --> 07:44.233
OF EDWARD R. MURROW AWARD

07:44.233 --> 07:45.367
WINNING JOURNALISM COULD HAVE

07:45.367 --> 07:47.066
POSSIBLY PREPARED HIM FOR THE

07:47.066 --> 07:48.433
QUESTION "DOES THE IDEA OF STEVE

07:48.433 --> 07:49.900
BANNON SUCKING HIS OWN COCK

07:49.900 --> 07:53.033
MAKE YOU ANGRY OR SAD?"

07:53.033 --> 07:54.133
AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE,

07:54.133 --> 07:55.300
SIX MONTHS INTO THE TRUMP

07:55.300 --> 07:56.967
ADMINISTRATION

07:56.967 --> 07:57.467
WITH A PRESIDENT WHO HAS

07:57.467 --> 07:58.500
NO MAJOR LEGISLATIVE

07:58.500 --> 08:00.266
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, NO CONCEPTION

08:00.266 --> 08:02.400
OF EVEN THE VERY BASICS OF HOW

08:02.400 --> 08:04.033
HIS JOB WORKS, AND A

08:04.033 --> 08:05.266
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR

08:05.266 --> 08:06.600
WHO ANSWERS THE QUESTION,

08:06.600 --> 08:07.533
WHAT IF A TANNING BED

08:07.533 --> 08:09.867
WAS A PERSON?

08:09.867 --> 08:11.533
AND YET, FRUSTRATINGLY, THERE IS

08:11.533 --> 08:13.066
NO PUBLIC INDICATION FROM TRUMP

08:13.066 --> 08:13.967
THAT HE THINKS HE'S DOING

08:13.967 --> 08:14.900
ANYTHING WRONG.

08:14.900 --> 08:17.066
IN FACT, ON FRIDAY, THIS WAS HIS

08:17.066 --> 08:18.166
TAKEAWAY FROM THE FAILED

08:18.166 --> 08:19.934
OBAMACARE REPEAL.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.700
>> THEY SHOULD HAVE APPROVED

08:21.700 --> 08:23.734
HEALTH CARE LAST NIGHT,

08:23.734 --> 08:25.600
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.066
YOU KNOW, I SAID FROM

08:26.066 --> 08:28.967
THE BEGINNING, LET OBAMACARE

08:28.967 --> 08:31.767
IMPLODE, AND THEN DO IT.

08:31.767 --> 08:34.166
I TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT.

08:34.166 --> 08:34.867
>> John: "I TURNED OUT

08:34.867 --> 08:37.033
TO BE RIGHT."

08:37.033 --> 08:38.433
NO ONE IS BETTER THAN TRUMP

08:38.433 --> 08:39.767
AT CLAIMING VICTORIES

08:39.767 --> 08:44.700
FROM OVERWHELMING DEFEATS.

08:44.700 --> 08:45.900
I COULD HONESTLY SEE HIM, AT THE

08:45.900 --> 08:47.100
END OF HIS TERM, SAYING, "I

08:47.100 --> 08:48.166
ALWAYS SAID I DIDN'T HAVE THE

08:48.166 --> 08:49.500
ABILITY, EXPERIENCE, OR

08:49.500 --> 08:50.600
INTELLIGENCE TO

08:50.600 --> 08:51.133
BE A SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT.

08:51.133 --> 08:52.934
I TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT."

08:52.934 --> 08:59.266
AND NOW THIS.

08:59.266 --> 09:01.834
>> Announcer: AND NOW MORE

09:01.834 --> 09:04.066
NEWSCASTERS DESPERATELY TRYING

09:04.066 --> 09:06.600
NOT TO SAY THE WORDS "SUCK MY

09:06.600 --> 09:07.834
OWN COCK."

09:07.834 --> 09:10.467
>> I AM NOT TRYING TO EXPLETIVE

09:10.467 --> 09:11.900
MY OWN EXPLETIVE.

09:11.900 --> 09:15.133
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO SUCK MY OWN

09:15.133 --> 09:16.066
[BLEEP]

09:16.066 --> 09:19.800
>> NOT TRYING THOUGH, THIS IS

09:19.800 --> 09:20.166
REALLY GRAPHIC.

09:20.166 --> 09:24.400
>> HE IS SAYING BANNON SHOULD

09:24.400 --> 09:25.467
PERFORM PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE

09:25.467 --> 09:26.834
ACTS ON HIMSELF.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.867
>> ACTS WHICH ARE IMPOSSIBLE,

09:29.867 --> 09:30.533
REQUIRING FLEXIBILITY NONE OF US

09:30.533 --> 09:31.433
HAVE.

09:31.433 --> 09:34.033
>> WHAT HE IS SAYING ABOUT STEVE

09:34.033 --> 09:35.800
BANNON, THAT WOULD MAKE HIM A

09:35.800 --> 09:37.433
GYMNAST.

09:37.433 --> 09:40.633
>> IT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING I'VE

09:40.633 --> 09:42.433
EVER SEEN.

09:42.433 --> 09:45.700
>> THE WAY SHE EXPRESSED IT.

09:45.700 --> 09:46.867
>> John: MOVING ON.

09:46.867 --> 09:47.700
FOR OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,

09:47.700 --> 09:48.233
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

09:48.233 --> 09:49.100
THE MEDIA.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.100
SPECIFICALLY, ONE INCREASINGLY

09:51.100 --> 09:52.400
INFLUENTIAL MEMBER OF IT:

09:52.400 --> 09:54.600
ALEX JONES, THE WALTER CRONKITE

09:54.600 --> 09:55.367
OF SHRIEKING BATSHIT GORILLA

09:55.367 --> 09:57.633
CLOWNS.

09:57.633 --> 09:58.867
AND I KNOW YOU MAY BE THINKING,

09:58.867 --> 09:59.734
"THERE'S NOTHING MORE I NEED

09:59.734 --> 10:01.533
TO KNOW ABOUT ALEX JONES."

10:01.533 --> 10:02.333
BECAUSE YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN

10:02.333 --> 10:04.333
CRAZY CLIPS LIKE THIS.

10:04.333 --> 10:04.967
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK

10:04.967 --> 10:06.033
TAP WATER IS?

10:06.033 --> 10:07.934
IT'S A GAY BOMB, BABY.

10:07.934 --> 10:08.700
AND I'M NOT SAYING PEOPLE DIDN'T

10:08.700 --> 10:09.867
NATURALLY HAVE HOMOSEXUAL

10:09.867 --> 10:11.133
FEELINGS, I'M NOT EVEN GETTING

10:11.133 --> 10:13.166
INTO IT.

10:13.166 --> 10:14.166
YOU THINK I'D, I'M LIKE, OH,

10:14.166 --> 10:15.500
SHOCKED BY IT, SO I'M UP HERE

10:15.500 --> 10:16.867
BASHING IT BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE

10:16.867 --> 10:17.800
GAY PEOPLE?

10:17.800 --> 10:18.667
I DON'T LIKE 'EM PUTTING

10:18.667 --> 10:19.767
CHEMICALS IN THE WATER THAT TURN

10:19.767 --> 10:22.533
THE FRIGGIN' FROGS GAY!

10:22.533 --> 10:24.600
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

10:24.600 --> 10:27.066
UGH, UGH, UGH, IT'S CRAP!

10:27.066 --> 10:28.266
>> John: WOW.

10:28.266 --> 10:29.200
IF HE'S THAT UPSET ABOUT

10:29.200 --> 10:30.300
A GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY THAT'S

10:30.300 --> 10:32.567
NOT HAPPENING, IMAGINE HOW UPSET

10:32.567 --> 10:33.667
HE'S GOING TO BE WHEN HE FINDS

10:33.667 --> 10:35.200
OUT ABOUT ONE THAT IS.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.000
LIKE THE FACT THAT THE

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
GOVERNMENT IS TURNING RACCOONS

10:37.000 --> 10:39.533
BILINGUAL.

10:39.533 --> 10:40.033
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

10:40.033 --> 10:40.800
THEY'RE ALL FLUENT IN FRENCH NOW

10:40.800 --> 10:41.967
AND THEY WILL BE WORKING THAT

10:41.967 --> 10:44.600
INTO CONVERSATION.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.934
AND THAT FAMOUS CLIP

10:45.934 --> 10:47.266
IS BY NO MEANS AN OUTLIER.

10:47.266 --> 10:49.166
JONES IS A CHARISMATIC PERFORMER

10:49.166 --> 10:49.900
WHO GETS CHARGED UP

10:49.900 --> 10:51.500
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.333
SO THERE ARE PLENTY

10:52.333 --> 10:53.400
OF LESSER-KNOWN OUTBURSTS,

10:53.400 --> 10:54.834
LIKE THIS.

10:54.834 --> 10:55.934
>> MY SPIRIT GETS CLOSE TO THAT

10:55.934 --> 10:57.266
EVIL AND I FEEL IT AND MY SPIRIT

10:57.266 --> 10:58.967
JUST GOES "AHHH!

10:58.967 --> 11:00.266
AHHH!

11:00.266 --> 11:01.567
AHHH!"

11:01.567 --> 11:02.367
THEY CALL THAT CRAZY.

11:02.367 --> 11:03.533
THAT'S NOT CRAZY.

11:03.533 --> 11:04.867
THAT'S MY WILL.

11:04.867 --> 11:05.800
MY HUMAN SPIRIT SAYING CRUSH

11:05.800 --> 11:06.667
THOSE THAT WOULD HURT

11:06.667 --> 11:07.567
THE INNOCENT!

11:07.567 --> 11:09.100
GO AFTER THE ENEMY!

11:09.100 --> 11:10.166
BUILD A CIVILIZATION!

11:10.166 --> 11:11.600
BE HONORABLE!

11:11.600 --> 11:12.266
CRUSH THE SNAKES

11:12.266 --> 11:15.734
UNDER YOUR FEET.

11:15.734 --> 11:16.600
>> John: NOW WE KNOW WHAT

11:16.600 --> 11:17.600
"FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS" WOULD'VE

11:17.600 --> 11:18.166
LOOKED LIKE IF THEY'D GIVEN

11:18.166 --> 11:20.467
COACH TAYLOR A NASTY PCP HABIT.

11:20.467 --> 11:21.367
"GO AFTER THE ENEMY!

11:21.367 --> 11:22.133
CRUSH THE SNAKES

11:22.133 --> 11:23.700
UNDER YOUR FEET.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.100
CLEAR EYES, FULL HEARTS.

11:25.100 --> 11:25.567
OH, GOD.

11:25.567 --> 11:26.834
THERE'S SNAKES EVERYWHERE!

11:26.834 --> 11:27.400
STOMP THOSE SNAKES,

11:27.400 --> 11:32.500
MOTHERFUCKERS!"

11:32.500 --> 11:33.567
AHHH!

11:33.567 --> 11:35.200
AHHH!

11:35.200 --> 11:37.800
NOW, IDEALLY, THE FIRST THING

11:37.800 --> 11:38.834
YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

11:38.834 --> 11:40.133
"THE ALEX JONES SHOW"

11:40.133 --> 11:41.133
IS NOTHING.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.400
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S AN

11:43.400 --> 11:44.367
IMPORTANT PART OF A LOT OF

11:44.367 --> 11:45.667
PEOPLE'S MEDIA DIETS.

11:45.667 --> 11:47.567
AN ESTIMATED 6 MILLION PEOPLE

11:47.567 --> 11:49.266
LISTEN TO HIS RADIO SHOW OR

11:49.266 --> 11:50.433
WATCH IT ONLINE EVERY WEEK,

11:50.433 --> 11:52.200
AND WE KNOW AT LEAST ONE JONES

11:52.200 --> 11:54.800
FAN SEEMS TO BE RUSSIAN

11:54.800 --> 11:56.033
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES,

11:56.033 --> 11:58.166
DONALD TRUMP.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.266
HE SUPPOSEDLY CALLED

11:59.266 --> 12:00.867
JONES AFTER THE ELECTION,

12:00.867 --> 12:01.900
HAS TWEETED CONTENT FROM

12:01.900 --> 12:04.433
INFOWARS AND ONE OF ITS EDITORS,

12:04.433 --> 12:05.767
AND JUST A YEAR AND A HALF AGO,

12:05.767 --> 12:07.600
EVEN APPEARED ON HIS SHOW.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.433
>> I JUST WANT TO FINISH

12:08.433 --> 12:09.200
BY SAYING YOUR REPUTATION

12:09.200 --> 12:10.834
IS AMAZING.

12:10.834 --> 12:12.533
I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.

12:12.533 --> 12:13.400
YOU WILL BE VERY, VERY

12:13.400 --> 12:15.800
IMPRESSED, I HOPE.

12:15.800 --> 12:16.600
AND I THINK WE'LL BE SPEAKING

12:16.600 --> 12:17.867
A LOT.

12:17.867 --> 12:18.934
>> John: THE ONLY THING THAT

12:18.934 --> 12:19.600
COULD'VE MADE THAT MOMENT

12:19.600 --> 12:20.834
ANY GROSSER IS IF

12:20.834 --> 12:21.734
NIGEL FARAGE, BILL COSBY,

12:21.734 --> 12:22.734
AND PHIL SPECTOR WERE ALL

12:22.734 --> 12:24.767
ON THE SAME CALL.

12:24.767 --> 12:26.100
SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT JONES

12:26.100 --> 12:26.800
HAS BEEN GETTING A LOT OF

12:26.800 --> 12:29.033
COVERAGE RECENTLY.

12:29.033 --> 12:30.266
WE EVEN MENTIONED HIM ON OUR

12:30.266 --> 12:31.633
FIRST SHOW OF THE SEASON,

12:31.633 --> 12:32.667
BACK IN FEBRUARY.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.033
AND IN HIS RESPONSE TO IT, HE

12:34.033 --> 12:36.467
SEEMED A LITTLE ANNOYED WITH ME.

12:36.467 --> 12:36.867
>> YOUR RATINGS

12:36.867 --> 12:37.467
ARE IN THE TOILET.

12:37.467 --> 12:38.667
YOU'RE A JOKE.

12:38.667 --> 12:41.266
THEY BROUGHT YOU BACK, REVAMPED,

12:41.266 --> 12:42.333
OUT OF THE GATES TO ATTACK YOURS

12:42.333 --> 12:45.834
TRULY, AFTER YOU LECTURED US

12:45.834 --> 12:46.767
THAT DONALD TRUMP COULD NEVER

12:46.767 --> 12:48.300
WIN OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

12:48.300 --> 12:48.800
'CAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU'RE

12:48.800 --> 12:53.166
THE INTELLECTUAL.

12:53.166 --> 12:53.867
EVERYBODY KNOWS A BRITISH ACCENT

12:53.867 --> 12:54.433
IS INTELLECTUAL.

12:54.433 --> 12:55.200
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO FACTS

12:55.200 --> 12:55.600
BEHIND IT.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.333
AND NOW YOU MAKE FUN OF ME

12:56.333 --> 12:56.800
OUT OF CONTEXT AND GO

12:56.800 --> 12:57.400
"LOOK AT THIS LOON."

12:57.400 --> 12:58.867
HEY, BOY!

12:58.867 --> 13:00.100
PEOPLE WANT LEGITIMACY.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.533
THEY WANT REAL.

13:02.533 --> 13:03.900
THEY WANT TO HEAR SOMEBODY THAT

13:03.900 --> 13:05.133
CAN SPEAK TO 'EM AND TOUCH 'EM

13:05.133 --> 13:09.233
INSIDE.

13:09.233 --> 13:10.367
>> John: OKAY, OKAY.

13:10.367 --> 13:11.367
A FEW THINGS THERE.

13:11.367 --> 13:12.633
ONE, DON'T CALL ME "BOY."

13:12.633 --> 13:13.867
AND TWO, MY BRITISH ACCENT

13:13.867 --> 13:16.233
DOES NOT SOUND INTELLECTUAL.

13:16.233 --> 13:17.500
I SOUND LIKE A CHIMNEY SWEEP

13:17.500 --> 13:17.867
PASSING THROUGH

13:17.867 --> 13:19.900
A WOOD CHIPPER.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.333
BUT I WILL GIVE HIM THIS.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.166
JONES IS RIGHT THAT TOO OFTEN,

13:23.166 --> 13:23.900
PEOPLE DON'T PRESENT HIM

13:23.900 --> 13:25.600
IN HIS FULL CONTEXT.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.133
SO TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO DO

13:27.133 --> 13:30.867
THAT.

13:30.867 --> 13:33.300
AND LET'S FIRST SET ASIDE THE

13:33.300 --> 13:34.000
KEY CONTEXT THAT ALEX JONES HAS

13:34.000 --> 13:34.667
REPEATEDLY USED HIS SHOW TO FUEL

13:34.667 --> 13:35.300
SPECULATION THAT THE

13:35.300 --> 13:36.133
SANDY HOOK MASSACRE WAS STAGED

13:36.133 --> 13:36.834
BY THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS

13:36.834 --> 13:37.767
BEEN DEEPLY HURTFUL FOR THE

13:37.767 --> 13:38.533
PARENTS OF THOSE CHILDREN

13:38.533 --> 13:40.100
OVER THE YEARS.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.767
THAT IS DISGUSTING AND SHOULD BE

13:41.767 --> 13:43.367
DISQUALIFYING IN TERMS OF EVER

13:43.367 --> 13:44.834
TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY.

13:44.834 --> 13:46.567
SADLY, DOING THINGS THAT

13:46.567 --> 13:47.667
DISQUALIFY YOU FROM BEING TAKEN

13:47.667 --> 13:49.333
SERIOUSLY DOESN'T REALLY SEEM

13:49.333 --> 13:52.333
TO BE A THING ANYMORE.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.000
BUT THERE'S A PIECE OF CONTEXT

13:54.000 --> 13:55.233
YOU MAY BE LESS AWARE OF,

13:55.233 --> 13:56.266
AND THAT CONCERNS THE NATURE

13:56.266 --> 13:59.033
OF HIS SHOW ITSELF.

13:59.033 --> 14:00.767
IT'S FOUR HOURS LONG, AND IF YOU

14:00.767 --> 14:02.333
TUNE IN TO THE WHOLE THING, YOUR

14:02.333 --> 14:03.400
MOST SHOCKING DISCOVERY MIGHT BE

14:03.400 --> 14:05.266
HOW FREQUENTLY AND SHAMELESSLY

14:05.266 --> 14:07.567
HE PITCHES PRODUCTS HE SELLS.

14:07.567 --> 14:08.333
IN FACT, REMEMBER THAT CLIP

14:08.333 --> 14:10.033
FROM HIM EARLIER YELLING ABOUT

14:10.033 --> 14:10.800
SNAKES?

CRUSH THE SNAKES

14:15.633 --> 14:18.400

14:30.033 --> 14:30.900
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN RUN THIS

14:30.900 --> 14:31.734

14:31.734 --> 14:32.367
WE WANT TO RUN IT THROUGH

14:32.367 --> 14:33.200
THE END OF THE MONTH.

14:33.200 --> 14:37.133
THAT'S LIKE 11 DAYS.

14:37.133 --> 14:38.800
I DON'T WANT IT TO SELL OUT

14:38.800 --> 14:39.567
BEFORE MORE GETS IN.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.800

15:07.800 --> 15:09.200
IN ONE WEEK OF RECENT BROADCASTS

15:09.200 --> 15:10.133
ON HIS SITE, WE FOUND HE SPENT

15:44.033 --> 15:45.934
IS THIS REGION RIGHT HERE.

15:57.967 --> 16:00.133
A BILL CLINTON RAPE WHISTLE,

16:00.133 --> 16:02.000
WHICH, ACCORDING TO INFOWARS,

16:02.000 --> 16:03.533
SHOULD BE USED TO "LET BILL KNOW

16:03.533 --> 16:05.100
YOU'RE IN THE CROWD AND THAT YOU

16:05.100 --> 16:07.433
KNOW THE TRUTH."

16:07.433 --> 16:12.967
THAT TRUTH?

16:12.967 --> 16:14.800
YOU JUST SPENT $6 ON A WHISTLE.

16:14.800 --> 16:15.700
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

16:15.700 --> 16:16.333
WE BOUGHT THIS.

16:16.333 --> 16:17.767
AND BY THE WAY, OUR ORDER CAME

16:17.767 --> 16:19.233
WITH A FREE "9/11 WAS AN INSIDE

16:19.233 --> 16:21.667
JOB" BUMPER STICKER WE MOST

16:21.667 --> 16:24.333
ASSUREDLY DID NOT ASK FOR.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.734
AND LOOK, RADIO HOSTS DOING ADS

16:26.734 --> 16:28.200
IS NOT INHERENTLY UNUSUAL.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.900
BUT SINCE 2013, JONES HAS

16:29.900 --> 16:31.100
INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON

16:31.100 --> 16:33.000
DEVELOPING HIS OWN PRODUCTS,

16:33.000 --> 16:34.834
WHICH HE SELLS ON HIS SITE,

16:34.834 --> 16:35.667
UNDER HIS

16:35.667 --> 16:37.400
INFOWARS LIFE BRAND.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.200
PARTICULARLY VITAMINS

16:39.200 --> 16:41.333
AND "NUTRACEUTICALS," WHICH I

16:41.333 --> 16:42.467
BELIEVE ARE THE RESULT OF THE

16:42.467 --> 16:43.266
WORD "NUTRITION" FUCKING

16:43.266 --> 16:44.900
THE WORD "PHARMACEUTICAL"

16:44.900 --> 16:53.066
FROM BEHIND.

16:53.066 --> 16:53.734
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S WHAT IT

16:53.734 --> 16:54.400
IS.

16:54.400 --> 16:54.900
THIS IS A BIG PART OF

16:54.900 --> 16:56.066
HIS BUSINESS.

16:56.066 --> 16:56.800
TWO-THIRDS OF JONES'S FUNDING

16:56.800 --> 16:57.400
REPORTEDLY COMES FROM SELLING

16:57.400 --> 16:57.734
HIS PRODUCTS.

16:57.734 --> 16:59.467
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM.

16:59.467 --> 17:00.800
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS,

17:00.800 --> 17:06.000
WE BOUGHT A WHOLE BUNCH.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.100
THERE IS SUPER MALE VITALITY.

17:08.100 --> 17:09.200
SUPER FEMALE VITALITY.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.100
WAKE UP, AMERICA, PATRIOT BLEND

17:10.100 --> 17:11.433
COFFEE.

17:11.433 --> 17:13.066
LUNG CLEANSE.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.200
"BRAIN FORCE PLUS.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.133
SOMETHING CALLED

17:15.133 --> 17:16.166
DNA FORCE, THAT COSTS $120

17:16.166 --> 17:18.967
A BOTTLE.

17:18.967 --> 17:21.066
AND CHILD EASE, A HERBAL BLEND

17:21.066 --> 17:22.500
WHICH, ACCORDING TO INFOWARS, IS

17:22.500 --> 17:24.133
"DESIGNED TO SOOTHE THE MIND AND

17:24.133 --> 17:26.133
BODIES OF CHILDREN,"

17:26.133 --> 17:27.233
WHICH IS A PROFOUNDLY CREEPY

17:27.233 --> 17:29.433
PHRASE.

17:29.433 --> 17:30.834
AND THEN THERE'S

17:30.834 --> 17:33.066
CAVEMAN TRUE PALEO FORMULA WITH

17:33.066 --> 17:35.233
BONE BROTH, A CHOCOLATE-FLAVORED

17:35.233 --> 17:37.767
DRINK MIX MADE FROM BEE POLLEN,

17:37.767 --> 17:38.867
STEVIA, AND THE DUST

17:38.867 --> 17:41.400
OF CHICKEN SKELETONS.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.133
ACCORDING TO INFOWARS, IT IS

17:43.133 --> 17:46.934
"ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR NEW

17:46.934 --> 17:47.767
HEALTH TREND IN THE WORLD

17:47.767 --> 17:48.600
TODAY."

17:48.600 --> 17:49.567
AND BY THE LOOK ON JONES' FACE,

17:49.567 --> 17:50.633
IT TASTES EXACTLY AS GOOD

17:50.633 --> 17:53.533
AS IT SOUNDS.

17:53.533 --> 17:54.333
>> YOU POUR THAT IN ON A COUPLE

17:54.333 --> 17:56.100
ICE CUBES, AND FOLKS, IT TASTES,

17:56.100 --> 17:56.967
WHEN IT'S CREAMY AND THICK,

17:56.967 --> 18:00.000
I THINK BETTER THAN OVALTINE

18:00.000 --> 18:01.567
AND IT IS GOT ALL THE BONE BROTH

18:01.567 --> 18:02.967
AND SO MUCH MORE.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.467
THIS IS WHY THE ANCIENTS,

18:04.467 --> 18:05.934
THEY BELIEVE, HAD SO MUCH BETTER

18:05.934 --> 18:06.667
BONES AND WERE SO MUCH

18:06.667 --> 18:08.200
HEALTHIER, YOU CAN LOOK IT UP.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.200
THIS, YOU COULD FREEZE THIS

18:09.200 --> 18:10.700
AND THIS WOULD BE BETTER THAN

18:10.700 --> 18:12.533
BLUE BELL CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.

18:12.533 --> 18:19.333
MMM.

18:19.333 --> 18:20.433
>> John: OKAY, I KNOW FOR A FACT

18:20.433 --> 18:21.800
THAT ALEX JONES DID NOT ENJOY

18:21.800 --> 18:25.033
DRINKING THAT GLASS OF CAVEMAN.

18:25.033 --> 18:26.367
BECAUSE I'VE GOT A GLASS

18:26.367 --> 18:28.166
OF CAVEMAN RIGHT HERE.

18:28.166 --> 18:33.767
AND I CAN CONFIRM THAT IT TASTES

18:33.767 --> 18:35.333
EXACTLY HOW YOU'D IMAGINE

18:35.333 --> 18:38.767
A DRINK WOULD TASTE THAT'S MADE

18:38.767 --> 18:40.033
FROM CHOCOLATE AND DOMESTICATED

18:40.033 --> 18:44.100
BIRD CORPSES.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.400
IT COMES AT YOU IN WAVES.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.000
AND THAT IS NOT THE ONLY TIME

18:46.000 --> 18:46.500
JONES HAS USED HIMSELF

18:46.500 --> 18:47.133
AS A GUINEA PIG TO SELL HIS OWN

18:47.133 --> 18:47.900
PRODUCTS.

18:47.900 --> 18:48.567
AND A WARNING TO OUR YOUNGER

18:48.567 --> 18:50.066
VIEWERS.

18:50.066 --> 18:51.433
THE FOLLOWING FOOTAGE OF A MAN

18:51.433 --> 18:53.367
GRAPHICALLY TOO COMFORTABLE WITH

18:53.367 --> 18:55.200
HIS OWN BODY MAY BE DISTURBING.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.166
>> JUST TEN MINUTES BEFORE

18:56.166 --> 18:57.667
WE TAPED THIS, DECIDED TO DO

18:57.667 --> 18:58.433
THIS 'CAUSE I HAVEN'T DONE THIS

18:58.433 --> 18:59.300
IN A WHILE.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.233
WE TOOK PHOTOS A YEAR AGO AND

19:01.233 --> 19:02.400
THEN AGAIN ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO

19:02.400 --> 19:04.133
AND THE WEIGHT LOSS IS DRAMATIC

19:04.133 --> 19:04.667
ALREADY FROM WHAT HAPPENED

19:04.667 --> 19:09.000
BEFORE.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.767
>> John: OKAY, SO YOU'RE REDDER

19:12.767 --> 19:13.667
AND YOU'RE WEARING A BELT.

19:13.667 --> 19:14.433
THE ONLY THING I CAN DISCERN

19:14.433 --> 19:15.900
HAPPENED BETWEEN THOSE TWO

19:15.900 --> 19:16.600
PHOTOS IS THAT YOU WALKED

19:16.600 --> 19:18.166
SHIRTLESS IN THE SUN FOR TWO

19:18.166 --> 19:21.166
HOURS TO A BELT STORE.

19:21.166 --> 19:22.266
YOU COULD FLIP THOSE TWO PHOTOS

19:22.266 --> 19:23.967
AROUND AND THE EFFECT WOULD BE

19:23.967 --> 19:25.800
EXACTLY THE SAME.

19:25.800 --> 19:29.934
ALSO...

19:29.934 --> 19:32.266
AND TO BE FAIR TO JONES, HE DOES

19:32.266 --> 19:33.367
HAVE A MEDICAL EXPERT

19:33.367 --> 19:34.033
WHO CONSULTS ON MANY OF HIS

19:34.033 --> 19:35.433
SUPPLEMENTS.

19:35.433 --> 19:37.333
DR. EDWARD GROUP III,

19:37.333 --> 19:38.667
WHO LOOKS LIKE THE LEAD

19:38.667 --> 19:40.200
IN A DIRECT-TO-DVD KATO KAELIN

19:40.200 --> 19:42.367
BIOPIC, BUT HE'S ACTUALLY EVEN

19:42.367 --> 19:45.100
LESS IMPRESSIVE THAN THAT.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.133
HERE HE IS IN AN INFOWARS AD,

19:46.133 --> 19:47.867
EXPLAINING THE IMPORTANCE OF ONE

19:47.867 --> 19:49.433
OF THE PRODUCTS.

19:49.433 --> 19:50.300
>> IF YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM

19:50.300 --> 19:52.467
ABDOMINAL PAIN, ALLERGIES,

19:52.467 --> 19:54.300
EVEN LIKE HEADACHES, ANEMIA,

19:54.300 --> 19:56.100
WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM,

19:56.100 --> 19:58.467
GUT PROBLEMS, DEPRESSION,

19:58.467 --> 20:01.166
HAIR LOSS, EXCESS GAS,

20:01.166 --> 20:03.066
MUSCLE PAIN, NERVOUSNESS.

20:03.066 --> 20:04.500
I MEAN, ALL THESE THINGS, IF YOU

20:04.500 --> 20:06.600
LOOK AT SOME OF THESE CONDITIONS

20:06.600 --> 20:07.800
AND THEN US OPENING UP OUR

20:07.800 --> 20:08.767
BORDERS AND ALL THE OTHER

20:08.767 --> 20:10.467
COUNTRIES OPENING UP OUR --

20:10.467 --> 20:11.734
THEIR BORDERS, YOU'RE JUST

20:11.734 --> 20:14.700
DEALING WITH A MASS AMOUNT OF

20:14.700 --> 20:17.033
PARASITES OR HARMFUL ORGANISMS.

20:17.033 --> 20:18.066
YOU CAN TYPE IN

20:18.066 --> 20:19.600
"REFUGEES SPREADING DISEASE."

20:19.600 --> 20:20.734
I MEAN, THE CDC IS GOING CRAZY

20:20.734 --> 20:22.400
RIGHT NOW.

20:22.400 --> 20:23.533
>> John: ACTUALLY, I'M PRETTY

20:23.533 --> 20:24.600
SURE IF YOU TYPE

20:24.600 --> 20:25.867
"REFUGEES SPREADING DISEASE"

20:25.867 --> 20:27.367
INTO GOOGLE AND PRESS ENTER IT

20:27.367 --> 20:28.767
TAKES YOU RIGHT TO THE WIKIPEDIA

20:28.767 --> 20:31.834
PAGE FOR XENOPHOBIA.

20:31.834 --> 20:34.033
WHICH IS A REAL TIME SAVER!

20:34.033 --> 20:35.200
BUT DESPITE THE FACT THAT

20:35.200 --> 20:36.333
DR. GROUP LOOKS LIKE WHAT WOULD

20:36.333 --> 20:36.767
HAPPEN IF TOM PETTY

20:36.767 --> 20:37.633
WAS MACHINE-WASHED INSTEAD

20:37.633 --> 20:39.600
OF DRY-CLEANED,

20:39.600 --> 20:42.133
ALEX JONES SWEARS BY HIM.

20:42.133 --> 20:43.066
IN FACT, HE'S BEEN PRETTY

20:43.066 --> 20:43.667
DEFENSIVE ABOUT DR. GROUP'S

20:43.667 --> 20:45.934
CREDENTIALS.

20:45.934 --> 20:46.934
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

20:46.934 --> 20:47.500
YOU'VE GOT DEGREES FROM MIT,

20:47.500 --> 20:48.300
AND EVERYWHERE ELSE,

20:48.300 --> 20:49.867
AND A BUNCH OF OTHER DEGREES.

20:49.867 --> 20:50.533
THE MEDIA MAKES FUN OF YOU

20:50.533 --> 20:52.467
AND SAYS THAT YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

20:52.467 --> 20:53.066
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

20:53.066 --> 20:53.934
>> I MEAN LITERALLY, THEY SAY WE

20:53.934 --> 20:54.867
CANNOT SELL COFFEE.

20:54.867 --> 20:55.867
IT'S A FRAUD.

20:55.867 --> 20:56.400
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.600
THAT'S RIGHT.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.367
I'VE BEEN A RESEARCH SCIENTIST

20:58.367 --> 20:59.166
FOR A LONG TIME.

20:59.166 --> 21:02.133
I DO HAVE A --

21:02.133 --> 21:03.834
I AM MIT ALUMNI, AND I CAN

21:03.834 --> 21:04.467
TELL YOU THAT I DO RESEARCH ALL

21:04.467 --> 21:05.800
THE TIME.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.834
>> John: OKAY, STOP.

21:08.834 --> 21:09.834
LET'S BREAK DOWN THAT

21:09.834 --> 21:10.467
"BUNCH OF DEGREES"

21:10.467 --> 21:11.400
JONES MENTIONED.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.500
GROUP DOES HAVE A DOCTOR OF

21:12.500 --> 21:13.900
CHIROPRACTIC DEGREE FROM TEXAS

21:13.900 --> 21:15.400
CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.567
BUT WHILE HE LISTS ALL THESE

21:17.567 --> 21:18.734
OTHER SCHOOLS ON LINKEDIN,

21:18.734 --> 21:19.900
WE CHECKED, AND HE DIDN'T

21:19.900 --> 21:21.133
GRADUATE FROM ANY OF THEM.

21:21.133 --> 21:22.500
IN FACT, WE ASKED HIM,

21:22.500 --> 21:24.166
AND HE ADMITS HE DOES NOT HAVE

21:24.166 --> 21:26.033
AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE.

21:26.033 --> 21:27.767
AND AS FOR WHETHER HE'S AN

21:27.767 --> 21:29.633
"MIT ALUMNI," HE ONLY COMPLETED

21:29.633 --> 21:30.967
A NON-DEGREE CERTIFICATE PROGRAM

21:30.967 --> 21:32.066
THERE.

21:32.066 --> 21:32.834
IN FACT, JUST TO BE SURE,

21:32.834 --> 21:34.200
WE ACTUALLY CONTACTED MIT,

21:34.200 --> 21:35.567
AND ACCORDING TO THEM,

21:35.567 --> 21:36.533
"IT IS NOT ACCURATE TO SAY

21:36.533 --> 21:38.900
HE HAS A DEGREE FROM MIT AND

21:38.900 --> 21:40.800
CALLING HIM AN ALUMNI WOULD BE

21:40.800 --> 21:45.333
INACCURATE AND MISLEADING."

21:45.333 --> 21:48.233
WHICH DOES MAKES SENSE,

21:48.233 --> 21:49.633
BECAUSE THIS MAN DOES NOT LOOK

21:49.633 --> 21:51.300
LIKE AN MIT ALUMNUS.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.433
HE LOOKS LIKE A FIFTH-YEAR

21:52.433 --> 21:53.400
SENIOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

21:53.400 --> 21:56.266
FALLING OFF A SURFBOARD.

21:56.266 --> 21:58.734
SO JUST TO CLARIFY, ALEX.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.533
THAT IS WHAT WE'RE MAKING FUN OF

22:00.533 --> 22:02.567
WHEN WE MAKE FUN OF DR. GROUP.

22:02.567 --> 22:04.400
WELL, THAT AND THE FACT THAT HE

22:04.400 --> 22:05.767
LOOKS LIKE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF

22:05.767 --> 22:07.900
IGGY POP GOT "THE RACHEL."

22:07.900 --> 22:09.533
AND LOOK, JONES CAN INFLATE

22:09.533 --> 22:10.100
DR. GROUP'S CREDENTIALS

22:10.100 --> 22:11.433
ALL HE WANTS.

22:11.433 --> 22:13.133
HE SAYS A LOT OF CRAZY SHIT

22:13.133 --> 22:15.200
ON HIS SHOW.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.533
BUT IT'S NOTICEABLE THAT WHEN IT

22:16.533 --> 22:17.266
COMES TO SELLING HIS

22:17.266 --> 22:18.734
SUPPLEMENTS, HE CAN SOMETIMES

22:18.734 --> 22:20.367
SHOW A CAUTION THAT IS PRETTY

22:20.367 --> 22:22.033
OUT OF CHARACTER.

22:22.033 --> 22:22.934
JUST WATCH HIM BEND OVER

22:22.934 --> 22:24.900
BACKWARD TO REPEATEDLY QUALIFY

22:24.900 --> 22:26.133
WHAT HE SAYS, SECONDS AFTER

22:26.133 --> 22:28.467
HE'S SAID IT.

22:28.467 --> 22:29.066
>> MAYBE YOU'VE HAD BACK PAIN

22:29.066 --> 22:29.500
BEFORE.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.066
MAYBE YOU'VE HAD NERVES THAT

22:30.066 --> 22:31.500
WERE CUT OFF.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.266
THIS CREATES TINGLING, THIS --

22:33.266 --> 22:33.900
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD THEIR

22:33.900 --> 22:34.834
FEELING COME BACK.

22:34.834 --> 22:36.400
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE CLAIMS,

22:36.400 --> 22:38.500
JUST RESEARCH TRUE ORGANICALLY

22:38.500 --> 22:39.934
BASED BIO PQQ.

22:39.934 --> 22:40.934
AND IT'S NOT TECHNICALLY

22:40.934 --> 22:43.233
ORGANIC, THE OTHER STUFF,

22:43.233 --> 22:46.033
SYNTHETIC, LAB MADE.

22:46.033 --> 22:48.066
THIS IS MADE FROM ORGANIC

22:48.066 --> 22:49.834
SOURCES, BUT THE BACTERIA'S GMO.

22:49.834 --> 22:51.200
I'LL JUST TELL YOU UPFRONT.

22:51.200 --> 22:51.934
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THE SUPER

22:51.934 --> 22:53.567
HI-TECH STUFF.

22:53.567 --> 22:54.800
IT'S A BACTERIA THAT'S JUST BEEN

22:54.800 --> 22:57.700
BRED TO BE ABLE TO THEN SECRETE

22:57.700 --> 22:58.400
AND PRODUCE.

22:58.400 --> 22:59.533
THAT'S JUST LIKE BEER

22:59.533 --> 23:00.233
IS BACTERIA, A LOT OF GOOD

23:00.233 --> 23:01.300
BACTERIA, OBVIOUSLY.

23:01.300 --> 23:02.300
BUT THIS ONE, THAT'S HOW

23:02.300 --> 23:03.667
THE JAPANESE DO IT.

23:03.667 --> 23:05.800
BUT IT'S BIO IDENTICAL.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.166
THE STUFF IS ONLY FOUND

23:07.166 --> 23:10.000
IN COMETS AND IN TRACE AMOUNTS

23:10.000 --> 23:15.700
IN BLUEBERRIES.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.734
>> John: WAIT.

23:17.734 --> 23:21.500
WAIT.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.367
LET'S BREAK THAT DOWN.

23:22.367 --> 23:23.033
IT REPAIRS NERVES BUT MAYBE

23:23.033 --> 23:23.567
DOESN'T.

23:23.567 --> 23:24.800
IT'S ORGANIC BUT NOT REALLY.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.333
IT CONTAINS GMOs, WHICH IS BAD,

23:26.333 --> 23:27.000
EXCEPT FOR WHEN HE'S SELLING

23:27.000 --> 23:28.333
YOU SOMETHING.

23:28.333 --> 23:29.200
AND YOU CAN ONLY FIND ITS

23:29.200 --> 23:31.100
INGREDIENTS IN COMETS.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.367
OH, AND BLUEBERRIES.

23:33.367 --> 23:34.467
AND IT'S THE DROPOFF AFTER THAT

23:34.467 --> 23:36.867
LAST ONE THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

23:36.867 --> 23:38.066
"YOU CAN ONLY FIND THIS STUFF

23:38.066 --> 23:40.800
IN DINOSAUR BONES AND IN TRACE

23:40.800 --> 23:43.367
AMOUNTS IN RITZ BITZ."

23:43.367 --> 23:44.233
AND JONES'S PRODUCTS

23:44.233 --> 23:45.266
DON'T COME CHEAP.

23:45.266 --> 23:46.700
FOR INSTANCE, HE SELLS THIS

23:46.700 --> 23:48.000
1 FLUID OUNCE BOTTLE OF VITAMIN

23:48.000 --> 23:50.633
D3 FOR $29.95.

23:50.633 --> 23:51.400
BUT ConsumerLab.com,

23:51.400 --> 23:52.900
A SUPPLEMENT WATCHDOG,

23:52.900 --> 23:53.934
POINTS OUT YOU CAN BUY THE

23:53.934 --> 23:55.333
SAME AMOUNT OF D3 FROM OTHER

23:55.333 --> 23:58.133
SOURCES FOR LESS THAN $4.

23:58.133 --> 24:00.700
BUT JONES WILL OFTEN GIVE

24:00.700 --> 24:01.834
YOU A HARD SELL.

24:01.834 --> 24:02.433
SOMETIMES, HE'LL TELL YOU HIS

24:02.433 --> 24:03.000
PRODUCTS ARE DIFFERENT THAN

24:03.000 --> 24:04.100
THE ONES YOU CAN FIND IN STORES.

24:04.100 --> 24:04.900
AND SOMETIMES, HE'LL GO EVEN

24:04.900 --> 24:07.000
BIGGER.

24:07.000 --> 24:07.967
>> IT IS ABSOLUTELY IN THE

24:07.967 --> 24:09.500
CRYSTALLINE FORM,

24:09.500 --> 24:10.200
THE STRONGEST --

24:10.200 --> 24:11.533
YOU ABSORB IT!

24:11.533 --> 24:12.767
SO, FOLKS, DON'T GO OUT TO THE

24:12.767 --> 24:14.066
STORE AND GET IODINE FROM, SAY,

24:14.066 --> 24:15.033
ONE OF THE BIG CHAINS.

24:15.033 --> 24:16.567
IT'LL KILL YOU.

24:16.567 --> 24:18.734
>> John: WOW.

24:18.734 --> 24:20.667
I HONESTLY DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD

24:20.667 --> 24:21.367
IMPLY YOUR COMPETITION KILLED

24:21.367 --> 24:22.967
PEOPLE.

24:22.967 --> 24:24.166
"FOUR OUT OF FIVE DENTISTS

24:24.166 --> 24:25.367
PREFER TRIDENT GUM, AND THE

24:25.367 --> 24:27.200
FIFTH DENTIST IS DEAD, BECAUSE

24:27.200 --> 24:28.834
HE PUT A PIECE OF WRIGLEY'S IN

24:28.834 --> 24:29.967
HIS MOUTH, AND THAT IS BASICALLY

24:29.967 --> 24:33.033
SUICIDE."

24:33.033 --> 24:36.467
AND TO HEAR JONES TELL IT,

24:36.467 --> 24:37.300
TO HEAR JONES TELL IT,

24:37.300 --> 24:38.166
HIS PRODUCTS ARE MARKED UP JUST

24:38.166 --> 24:38.800
ENOUGH TO KEEP HIS BUSINESS

24:38.800 --> 24:40.100
GOING, AS HE EXPLAINED

24:40.100 --> 24:41.600
IN HIS RECENT APPEARANCE ON

24:41.600 --> 24:42.500
"RATIONALIZING LOW RATINGS

24:42.500 --> 24:44.600
WITH MEGYN KELLY."

24:44.600 --> 24:45.834
>> I MEAN, IT COSTS $45 MILLION

24:45.834 --> 24:46.300
TO $50 MILLION A YEAR

24:46.300 --> 24:46.800
TO RUN THIS.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.967
>> HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING MADE?

24:48.967 --> 24:49.900
>> WELL, THE MONEY THAT'S MADE

24:49.900 --> 24:50.400
IS PRETTY MUCH PUT BACK

24:50.400 --> 24:56.300
INTO THINGS.

24:56.300 --> 24:57.533
>> John: THAT'S REMARKABLE FOR

24:57.533 --> 25:02.333
TWO REASONS.

25:02.333 --> 25:03.400
$45 MILLION TO $50 MILLION

25:03.400 --> 25:04.166
IS A LOT OF MONEY TO

25:04.166 --> 25:05.233
BE MAKING, AND YET, JONES WOULD

25:05.233 --> 25:05.800
HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT EVERY

25:05.800 --> 25:06.433
PENNY IS PRETTY MUCH BEING SPENT

25:06.433 --> 25:07.066
ON A SHOW THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS

25:07.066 --> 25:07.533
FILMED ON THE SET OF

25:07.533 --> 25:08.066
A LOW-BUDGET PORN PARODY

25:08.066 --> 25:09.900
OF ITSELF.

25:09.900 --> 25:10.900
IN FACT, AS HE FREQUENTLY TELLS

25:10.900 --> 25:12.700
HIS AUDIENCE, HE NEEDS THEM

25:12.700 --> 25:13.767
TO BUY MORE TO KEEP HIS

25:13.767 --> 25:15.166
TRUTH-TELLING CRUSADE SOLVENT

25:15.166 --> 25:16.834
AND GROWING.

25:16.834 --> 25:18.033
>> WE NEED TO FUND OURSELVES AND

25:18.033 --> 25:19.200
WE FUND OURSELVES BY YOU BUYING

25:19.200 --> 25:20.367
THE PRODUCTS.

25:20.367 --> 25:21.000
WE'RE AT A SHORTFALL NOW BECAUSE

25:21.000 --> 25:22.867
OF THE MASSIVE, SUSTAINED

25:22.867 --> 25:24.633
ECONOMIC ATTACKS WE'RE UNDER.

25:24.633 --> 25:25.800
BUT THE LISTENERS IN JUST TWO

25:25.800 --> 25:26.333
WEEKS HAVE ALMOST NARROWED

25:26.333 --> 25:28.000
THAT GAP.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.600
I COULD HAVE TO SELL MY HOUSE TO

25:29.600 --> 25:30.633
KEEP THIS PLACE RUNNING THREE,

25:30.633 --> 25:31.500
FOUR MONTHS.

25:31.500 --> 25:32.200
I COULD HAVE SPONSORS EVERY

25:32.200 --> 25:33.000
SEGMENT.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.266
I DON'T DO IT.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.100
I PLUG ENOUGH TO FUND THINGS.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.400
FUND US!

25:37.400 --> 25:38.500
GIVE ME THE ENERGY AND I WILL

25:38.500 --> 25:42.967
ATTACK THE ENEMY.

25:42.967 --> 25:44.033
>> John: EXACTLY.

25:44.033 --> 25:44.834
IT'S LIKE AN NPR PLEDGE DRIVE

25:44.834 --> 25:46.066
FOR PEOPLE WHO HATE NPR.

25:46.066 --> 25:47.400
BECAUSE TO LISTEN TO JONES,

25:47.400 --> 25:48.433
INFOWARS IS PERPETUALLY ON THE

25:48.433 --> 25:49.767
EDGE OF DISASTER.

25:49.767 --> 25:50.433
HE EVEN HAS A LINK

25:50.433 --> 25:51.867
ON THE INFOWARS STORE

25:51.867 --> 25:53.367
WHERE YOU CAN JUST GIVE HIM

25:53.367 --> 25:54.834
MONEY TO "HELP FUND THE FIGHT

25:54.834 --> 25:56.567
AGAINST TYRANNY" AND

25:56.567 --> 25:57.867
CONTRIBUTORS HAVE LEFT COMMENTS

25:57.867 --> 25:59.834
LIKE, "$25 MAY NOT BE MUCH, BUT

25:59.834 --> 26:02.500
I KNOW EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS."

26:02.500 --> 26:03.900
BUT JONES SEEMS TO BE DOING

26:03.900 --> 26:05.400
A BIT MORE THAN KEEPING HIS HEAD

26:05.400 --> 26:06.900
ABOVE WATER.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.200
EX-EMPLOYEES DESCRIBE A THRIVING

26:08.200 --> 26:09.934
BUSINESS, WITH ONE SAYING,

26:09.934 --> 26:11.633
"HE CAN SELL 500 SUPPLEMENTS

26:11.633 --> 26:12.433
IN AN HOUR.

26:12.433 --> 26:15.266
IT'S LIKE QVC FOR CONSPIRACY."

26:15.266 --> 26:16.066
AND IN ONE OF THOSE

26:16.066 --> 26:17.266
CLIPS WE SHOWED EARLIER,

26:17.266 --> 26:18.300
WE NOTICED HE'S WEARING

26:18.300 --> 26:20.600
WHAT LOOKS LIKE A ROLEX WATCH

26:20.600 --> 26:23.266
WORTH AROUND $8,000, WHICH --

26:23.266 --> 26:25.266
COOL.

26:25.266 --> 26:26.500
AND AS WE LOOKED AROUND,

26:26.500 --> 26:28.700
WE NOTICED HE ALSO SEEMS TO OWN

26:28.700 --> 26:34.166
ANOTHER TWO DIFFERENT ROLEXES,

26:34.166 --> 26:36.800
YOU KNOW -- COOLER.

26:36.800 --> 26:37.700
AND THAT'S HONESTLY FINE.

26:37.700 --> 26:38.233
HE CAN HAVE FANCY WATCHES.

26:38.233 --> 26:38.834
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM

26:38.834 --> 26:39.500
GETTING PAID.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.166
I GET PAID TO MAKE THIS SHOW.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.467
BUT IT DOES FIGHT WITH HIS

26:42.467 --> 26:46.867
MESSAGE THAT HE NEEDS YOU TO BUY

26:46.867 --> 26:53.767
PRODUCTS TO HELP

26:53.767 --> 26:54.734
KEEP HIS SHOW GOING.

26:54.734 --> 26:55.367
AND EVEN ALEX JONES SEEMS TO BE

26:55.367 --> 26:56.000
A LITTLE SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT

26:56.000 --> 26:56.367
THAT DISCONNECT.

26:56.367 --> 26:56.734
BUT DON'T WORRY.

26:56.734 --> 26:57.333
HE'S RECONCILED IT IN A TRULY

26:57.333 --> 26:57.934
AMAZING WAY.

26:57.934 --> 26:59.166
>> I WEAR A BLUE SPORTS COAT AND

26:59.166 --> 27:00.300
A ROLEX BECAUSE IT'S A SYMBOL OF

27:00.300 --> 27:01.600
MIDDLE CLASS AND HUMANITY HAVING

27:01.600 --> 27:03.233
PROSPERITY AND PROMOTING HUMAN

27:03.233 --> 27:05.300
PROSPERITY FOR THE RESPECT OF

27:05.300 --> 27:07.000
EMPOWERING HUMANITY AND STEALING

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
THE IMAGE OF A MAN IN A SPORTS

27:09.000 --> 27:10.467
JACKET WITH A ROLEX, THAT IS THE

27:10.467 --> 27:13.400
SATANIC IMAGE, SO I DRESS AS A

27:13.400 --> 27:15.266
SATANIST SO THAT I CAN ENTER

27:15.266 --> 27:17.567
THEIR WORLD AND SHOW YOU THAT

27:17.567 --> 27:19.700
NONE OF IT MEANS ANYTHING.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.300
>> John: OH, BULLSHIT.

27:22.300 --> 27:23.000
HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK

27:23.000 --> 27:25.900
YOUR AUDIENCE IS?

27:25.900 --> 27:26.800
OKAY, YOU BOUGHT A ROLEX SO YOU

27:26.800 --> 27:28.333
COULD DRESS UP LIKE A SATANIST.

27:28.333 --> 27:31.100
WHAT ARE THE OTHER TWO FOR?

27:31.100 --> 27:31.834
AND INCIDENTALLY, TORMENTING

27:31.834 --> 27:33.567
THE PARENTS OF SANDY HOOK SHOULD

27:33.567 --> 27:34.567
COMFORTABLY GET YOU INTO THE

27:34.567 --> 27:35.967
SATANIC CLUB.

27:35.967 --> 27:37.533
I BELIEVE THAT'S THE E-Z PASS

27:37.533 --> 27:38.166
TO WHATEVER HELL'S VERSION OF

27:38.166 --> 27:41.266
"THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM" IS.

27:41.266 --> 27:42.000
AND SO, AT THE START OF THIS

27:42.000 --> 27:43.100
PIECE, I PROMISED ALEX JONES

27:43.100 --> 27:43.934
THAT I WOULD PUT HIS STATEMENTS

27:43.934 --> 27:45.367
IN CONTEXT.

27:45.367 --> 27:46.900
BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT THAT IF YOU

27:46.900 --> 27:48.834
PLAY SMALL CLIPS IN ISOLATION,

27:48.834 --> 27:50.300
HE LOOKS LIKE A LOON.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.867
BUT IF YOU PLAY THEM IN CONTEXT,

27:52.867 --> 27:53.567
HE LOOKS LIKE A SKILLED

27:53.567 --> 27:56.266
SALESMAN, SPENDING HOURS A DAY

27:56.266 --> 27:57.133
FRIGHTENING YOU ABOUT PROBLEMS

27:57.133 --> 27:59.200
LIKE REFUGEES SPREADING DISEASE

27:59.200 --> 28:01.900
AND THEN SELLING YOU AN ANSWER.

28:01.900 --> 28:03.500
REMEMBER THAT GAY FROG CLIP?

28:03.500 --> 28:05.667
HE DID A FOLLOWUP SHOW

28:05.667 --> 28:06.333
EXPLAINING HOW CHEMICALS WERE

28:06.333 --> 28:08.500
BEING PLACED IN TAP WATER TO

28:08.500 --> 28:09.633
FEMINIZE SOCIETY AND REDUCE THE

28:09.633 --> 28:11.200
POPULATION AND THEN IMMEDIATELY

28:11.200 --> 28:13.467
SEGUED TO THIS.

28:13.467 --> 28:15.100
>> WE SELL FIVE DIFFERENT BRANDS

28:15.100 --> 28:16.233
OF THE VERY BEST WATER

28:16.233 --> 28:18.133
FILTRATION SYSTEMS OUT THERE.

28:18.133 --> 28:19.333
THEY'RE AMAZING.

28:19.333 --> 28:21.133
THEY CUT OUT 99.99% OF THE

28:21.133 --> 28:22.200
GLYPHOSATE, THE HERBICIDES,

28:22.200 --> 28:24.300
THE PESTICIDES, THE FLUORIDE.

28:24.300 --> 28:25.967
>> John: WOW.

28:25.967 --> 28:26.767
TO AN UNTRAINED EYE, IT SURE

28:26.767 --> 28:28.767
SEEMS LIKE HE WAS USING THE IDEA

28:28.767 --> 28:29.900
OF A GAY FROG TO SELL HIS

28:29.900 --> 28:31.900
PRODUCTS, WHICH, INCIDENTALLY,

28:31.900 --> 28:32.734
IS THE SAME MISTAKE

28:32.734 --> 28:38.166
THE WB NETWORK MADE.

28:38.166 --> 28:39.567
AND LISTEN, I'M NOT SAYING

28:39.567 --> 28:41.066
THE ONLY REASON JONES IS TALKING

28:41.066 --> 28:47.500
ABOUT THE DEEP STATE

28:47.500 --> 28:48.333
-- GLOBALISTS SYSTEMATICALLY

28:48.333 --> 28:49.400
FEMINIZING US

28:49.400 --> 28:49.967
TO SELL OVERPRICED

28:49.967 --> 28:50.600
NUTRACEUTICALS SO HE CAN BUY

28:50.600 --> 28:52.033
LUXURY WATCHES.

28:52.033 --> 28:52.633
BUT IF I WERE, IT CERTAINLY

28:52.633 --> 28:53.567
WOULDN'T BE THE STUPIDEST

28:53.567 --> 28:54.166
CONSPIRACY THEORY YOU'VE HEARD

28:54.166 --> 28:54.667
TONIGHT.

28:54.667 --> 28:55.900
SO IF ALEX JONES WANTS HIS WORDS

28:55.900 --> 28:58.767
IN CONTEXT, THIS IS IT.

28:58.767 --> 29:00.100
THE FACT THAT HE HAPPENS TO SELL

29:00.100 --> 29:01.633
SO MANY SOLUTIONS SHOULD REALLY

29:01.633 --> 29:03.433
RECONTEXTUALIZE HOW YOU THINK

29:03.433 --> 29:05.800
ABOUT WHAT HE IS CLAIMING ARE

29:05.800 --> 29:06.700
PROBLEMS.

29:06.700 --> 29:08.367
THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THIS.

29:08.367 --> 29:10.000
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF, AT THE

29:10.000 --> 29:14.233
END OF THIS SEGMENT THAT MAY'VE

29:14.233 --> 29:15.367
MADE YOU FEEL A LITTLE DIRTY,

29:15.367 --> 29:16.533
I TRIED TO SELL YOU SOMETHING TO

29:16.533 --> 29:18.200
WIPE THAT GROSS FEELING AWAY?

29:18.200 --> 29:20.500
WOULD YOU QUESTION MY MOTIVES?

29:20.500 --> 29:22.066
WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT,

29:22.066 --> 29:23.200
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING

29:23.200 --> 29:25.400
RIGHT NOW!

29:25.400 --> 29:27.200
COME WITH ME.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.033
COME WITH ME.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.500
BECAUSE I'M PROUD TO SAY WE'VE

29:29.500 --> 29:30.934
BEEN WORKING WITH A LEADING

29:30.934 --> 29:33.400
MEDICAL EXPERT, AND I'D LIKE

29:33.400 --> 29:35.900

29:57.367 --> 29:58.767
EXCLUSIVELY ON THE PERINEUM.

29:58.767 --> 29:59.600
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.567
FOR GOODNESS SAKE, DON'T USE

30:00.567 --> 30:02.867
THIS ANYWHERE ELSE.

30:02.867 --> 30:09.700
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO JUST

30:09.700 --> 30:12.133
FOCUS ON THIS AREA HERE.

30:12.133 --> 30:14.100

30:16.033 --> 30:16.800
BETTER ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE SEEN

30:16.800 --> 30:18.934
TONIGHT?

30:18.934 --> 30:20.500
>> WELL, MY STUDIES SHOW THAT

30:20.500 --> 30:22.066
WHEN YOU VIGOROUSLY APPLY THIS

30:22.066 --> 30:24.400
TAINT WIPE, IT CAUSES

30:24.400 --> 30:25.467
A SENSATION THAT DISTRACTS

30:25.467 --> 30:26.567
THE BRAIN FROM WHATEVER IT HAD

30:26.567 --> 30:29.700
PREVIOUSLY BEEN THINKING ABOUT.

30:29.700 --> 30:30.767
>> John: AND, AGAIN, YOU'VE GOT

30:30.767 --> 30:32.433
DEGREES FROM MIT AND EVERYWHERE

30:32.433 --> 30:33.000
ELSE AND A BUNCH OF OTHER

30:33.000 --> 30:34.200
DEGREES.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.300
THE MEDIA MAKES FUN OF YOU AND

30:35.300 --> 30:36.200
SAYS THAT YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

30:36.200 --> 30:40.467
>> THEY DO!

30:40.467 --> 30:41.333
>> John: BUT YOU DID GO TO MIT,

30:41.333 --> 30:42.066
RIGHT?

30:42.066 --> 30:42.967
>> WELL, I'VE DEFINITELY

30:42.967 --> 30:45.233
PHYSICALLY BEEN THERE.

30:45.233 --> 30:45.934
>> John: THAT'S ESSENTIALLY

30:45.934 --> 30:46.767
THE SAME.

31:12.934 --> 31:14.433

ALL I'LL SAY IS, PEOPLE PAY
