WEBVTT

00:03.604 --> 00:05.506
Chloe:
MOMMY! MOMMY!

00:05.506 --> 00:08.039
STAN'S GONNA BE
IN A TALENT SHOW!

00:08.039 --> 00:09.580
THERE'S A COMPETITION
IN THE PARK,

00:09.580 --> 00:11.582
AND I LET CHLOE AND STAN
SIGN UP.

00:11.582 --> 00:13.484
WHAT'S HIS TALENT?
JUMPING UP ON A CHAIR

00:13.484 --> 00:15.546
AND GRABBING THE HAMBURGER MEAT
OUT OF MY HANDS?

00:15.546 --> 00:16.717
HE'S REALLY GOOD AT THAT.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.589
Stan:
YOU TIME THAT WRONG,

00:18.589 --> 00:21.222
ALL YOU GET IS A MOUTHFUL
OF BONY WRIST.

00:21.222 --> 00:24.095
BUT DON'T BE DISAPPOINTED
IF HE DOESN'T WIN.

00:24.095 --> 00:27.128
IT'S NOT LIKE STAN HAS
ANY SORT OF SPECIAL TALENTS.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.660
TYLER, WE ARE GONNA NEED YOU
TO TAKE CHLOE TO THE PARK

00:29.660 --> 00:32.363
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS
FOR THE ANIMAL TALENT SHOW.

00:32.363 --> 00:34.705
THE WINNER GETS TO BE
IN A PET FOOD COMMERCIAL
WITH THEIR DOG.

00:34.705 --> 00:36.767
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE GONNA WIN.

00:36.767 --> 00:38.639
STAN HAS NO TALENT.

00:45.816 --> 00:47.718
Bennett: TYLER,

00:47.718 --> 00:50.221
YOU ARE GONNA HELP
YOUR SISTER WITH THIS

00:50.221 --> 00:53.324
BECAUSE WE ARE A FAMILY
AND WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER.

00:56.227 --> 00:59.230
STAN IS SO SMART,
WE'LL WIN FOR SURE!

00:59.230 --> 01:01.832
HA! GIRLS WILL SEE ME
IN A TV COMMERCIAL

01:01.832 --> 01:06.066
AND I'LL BE LIKE,
"THAT'S RIGHT,
I'M ON TV, GIRLS."

01:06.066 --> 01:08.739
ALL MY FRIENDS WILL SEE ME
ON A TV COMMERCIAL

01:08.739 --> 01:13.404
AND I'LL BE LIKE,
"THAT'S RIGHT, I'M ON TV,
GIRLS."

01:13.404 --> 01:15.776
CUTE POODLES WILL SEE ME
IN A TV COMMERCIAL

01:15.776 --> 01:19.380
AND I'LL BE LIKE, "WOOF!"
AND THEY'LL BE LIKE, "WOOF!"

01:19.380 --> 01:23.214
CUZ THAT'S HOW
I PLAY THE LADIES.

01:23.214 --> 01:26.357
Stan: IT WOULD BE SO COOL
TO WIN THE TALENT SHOW
AND DO A COMMERCIAL.

01:26.357 --> 01:28.459
STAN...

01:28.459 --> 01:30.561
STAN...

01:30.561 --> 01:32.393
(melodramatic) STAN.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.695
WAIT, WHAT AM I SELLING HERE?

01:34.695 --> 01:36.767
OH, RIGHT. KIBBLE. I MEAN...

01:36.767 --> 01:39.600
(melodramatic) KIBBLE.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.672
♪♪

01:57.248 --> 01:59.720
( school bell rings )

01:59.720 --> 02:02.393
AVERY, COME ON,
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR
THE INTERNET SAFETY ASSEMBLY.

02:02.393 --> 02:04.825
YOU LOVE SAFETY ASSEMBLIES.
THE FUN ONES,

02:04.825 --> 02:06.857
LIKE "HOW TO TAKE CONTROL
OF A RUNAWAY BUS"

02:06.857 --> 02:09.730
OR "SNEEZING INTO YOUR ARM
TO AVOID A PANDEMIC."

02:10.901 --> 02:13.264
BUT MY DAD IS
THE ONE SPEAKING.

02:13.264 --> 02:15.666
HE'S LECTURING ON
THE DANGERS OF THE INTERNET

02:15.666 --> 02:17.908
BECAUSE HE WROTE ONE OF
HIS PARENTING BOOKS ABOUT IT.

02:17.908 --> 02:20.411
ACHOO!
INTO YOUR ARM!

02:22.273 --> 02:24.915
IT IS SO EMBARRASSING
HAVING YOUR PARENTS AT SCHOOL.

02:24.915 --> 02:27.378
I KNOW. THAT TIME
I BROKE MY ANKLE IN GYM,

02:27.378 --> 02:30.451
I DIDN'T CALL MY MOM
'CAUSE I KNEW SHE'D COME
PICK ME UP.

02:30.451 --> 02:33.224
HEY, BY ANY CHANCE
DID YOU BRING YOUR...

02:33.224 --> 02:34.785
Both: ...EMBARRASSMENT HAT
WITH THE BIG FLOPPY BRIM

02:34.785 --> 02:36.487
THAT COVERS YOUR FACE?

02:40.291 --> 02:42.363
AVERY,
THE ASSEMBLY'S OVER.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.295
YOU CAN TAKE THAT OFF NOW.

02:44.295 --> 02:47.638
SO, YOUR DAD IS
THE INTERNET SHERIFF, HUH?

02:47.638 --> 02:49.540
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.

02:49.540 --> 02:53.944
"LAME DAD AT BACKSLASH DOT
HIDE ME IN A HAT." (giggles )

02:53.944 --> 02:56.207
HE HAS SUCH STUPID RULES.

02:56.207 --> 02:58.579
NO SOCIAL NETWORK SITES
UNTIL YOU'RE FIFTEEN?

02:58.579 --> 03:01.252
YOU MUST BE THE ONLY ONE
IN OUR GRADE WHO'S NOT ON
BUDDYBOP.

03:01.252 --> 03:03.183
HOW DO YOU SHARE
PICTURES AND VIDEOS--

03:03.183 --> 03:05.486
TEXTING?
( all laugh )

03:05.486 --> 03:07.288
NO. (forced laugh)

03:07.288 --> 03:10.461
I HAVE THE DRUGSTORE
PRINT DOUBLES. HA HA HA!

03:10.461 --> 03:13.364
( Avery continues laughing )

03:17.468 --> 03:19.430
OF COURSE I'M ON BUDDYBOP.

03:19.430 --> 03:21.402
I MEAN, I'D HAVE TO BE
PRETTY LAME TO BE

03:21.402 --> 03:25.306
THE ONLY KID IN THE WHOLE GRADE
NOT ON BUDDYBOP, RIGHT?

03:25.306 --> 03:26.937
COOL.
WHAT'S YOUR SCREEN NAME?

03:26.937 --> 03:29.340
OH, UM...(clears throat)...

03:33.414 --> 03:35.446
MY SCREEN NAME IS, UH,

03:35.446 --> 03:37.748
"LincolnRussiaUglySweater."

03:37.748 --> 03:40.451
WE'LL BUDDYBOP YOU
AFTER SCHOOL.

03:40.451 --> 03:42.493
GREAT. (fake laugh)

03:42.493 --> 03:44.295
AVERY, YOU'RE NOT
ON BUDDYBOP.

03:44.295 --> 03:47.298
THOSE GIRLS ARE GONNA BOP
"LincolnRussiaUglySweater"
AFTER SCHOOL--

03:47.298 --> 03:49.800
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
RACE HOME AND OPEN AN ACCOUNT

03:49.800 --> 03:52.763
WITHOUT MY PARENTS FINDING OUT
BEFORE THOSE GIRLS GO ONLINE?

03:52.763 --> 03:55.736
I JUST HOPE
NO ONE'S TAKEN THE NAME
"LincolnRussiaUglySweater."

03:55.736 --> 03:59.440
I THINK THAT'S THE ONE THING
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.

04:01.612 --> 04:04.375
GO!
( video game noises )

04:04.375 --> 04:05.546
OFF, OFF, OFF.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.548
OFF OFF OFF
OFF OFF OFF.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.719
OHH!

04:10.250 --> 04:13.324
THAT'S BUDDYBOP.
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
ON BUDDYBOP!

04:13.324 --> 04:15.586
THIS IS TEENAGER STUFF.
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER.

04:15.586 --> 04:20.561
MOMMY ALWAYS SAYS THAT TOO.
I'M GONNA BE REALLY SMART
WHEN I'M OLDER.

04:20.561 --> 04:23.734
HEY, AVE.
HEY! WHAT? NOTHING.
I'M DOING MY HOMEWORK.

04:23.734 --> 04:26.767
OH. I WAS JUST GONNA ASK
HOW YOUR FATHER'S TALK
AT SCHOOL TODAY WENT.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.870
GREAT. INSPIRING.
IT ACTUALLY GOT ME
LOTS OF ATTENTION.

04:29.870 --> 04:34.575
KIDS CAME UP TO ME THAT
I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN BEFORE
AND...SAID THINGS.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.348
THAT'S GREAT!
I'M GONNA ENCOURAGE HIM
TO DO HIS TALK...

04:37.348 --> 04:40.481
"MY BODY'S CHANGING--
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?"

04:43.584 --> 04:46.557
ALL RIGHT, THERE WE GO.
GOT MY ACCOUNT SET UP.

04:46.557 --> 04:48.589
Computer: BUDDY BOP.
BUDDY BOP. BUDDY BOP.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.721
WHOA, JUST IN TIME.
I'M GETTING A TON OF BOPS.

04:50.721 --> 04:53.564
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
ABOUT SHOWING PICTURES
TO YOUR FRIENDS?

04:53.564 --> 04:56.427
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. YOU CAN
SEE EACH OTHER'S PICTURES

04:56.427 --> 04:58.369
AND THEN MAKE CLEVER
COMMENTS ON THEM.

04:58.369 --> 04:59.370
( clears throat )

04:59.370 --> 05:02.403
"LOVE YOUR FEET." EXCLAM.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.405
SEE?

05:04.405 --> 05:06.877
IS THAT IMPORTANT ENOUGH
TO KICK YOUR SISTER
OFF THE CHAIR

05:06.877 --> 05:08.409
AND LIE TO MOMMY?

05:08.409 --> 05:10.811
WOW. I DID THAT,
DIDN'T I?

05:10.811 --> 05:13.584
I GUESS I JUST GOT
SO CAUGHT UP IN
WANTING TO FIT IN

05:13.584 --> 05:15.446
I DIDN'T REALLY
SEE IT THAT WAY.

05:15.446 --> 05:18.819
BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,
YES. YES IT IS THAT IMPORTANT.

05:20.391 --> 05:22.353
Stan: OH, GOOD,
YOU'RE HERE.

05:22.353 --> 05:25.456
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT I'M DOING FOR
THE TALENT SHOW TOMORROW.

05:25.456 --> 05:27.398
WE HAVE TO FIND
SOMETHING GREAT YOU CAN DO

05:27.398 --> 05:28.799
WITHOUT LETTING PEOPLE KNOW
YOU CAN TALK.

05:28.799 --> 05:31.061
HMM...I'VE GOT IT!

05:33.404 --> 05:36.507
ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH,
DEAR FRIENDS, ONCE MORE,

05:36.507 --> 05:38.839
OR CLOSE THE WALL UP
WITH OUR ENGLISH DEAD.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.671
THAT'S GREAT, STAN, BUT--

05:40.671 --> 05:43.113
IN PEACE THAT'S NOTHING
SO BECOMES A MAN

05:43.113 --> 05:45.345
AS MODEST STILLNESS
AND HUMILITY.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.346
STAN, YOU CAN'T--

05:46.346 --> 05:49.079
BUT WHEN THE BLAST OF WAR
BLOWS IN OUR EARS,

05:49.079 --> 05:50.981
THEN IMITATE THE ACTION
OF THE TIGER.

05:50.981 --> 05:53.353
STIFFEN THE SINEWS,
SUMMON UP THE BLOOD,

05:53.353 --> 05:57.488
DISGUISE FAIR NATURE
WITH HARD-FAVOUR'D RAGE!

05:58.859 --> 06:01.131
IT'S SHAKESPEARE. HENRY V.

06:01.131 --> 06:02.933
YOU CAN'T TALK.

06:02.933 --> 06:05.496
I WASN'T TALKING.
I WAS ACTING.

06:05.496 --> 06:08.038
MORE LIKE OVERACTING.

06:08.038 --> 06:10.040
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THE JUDGES ARE GONNA SAY,

06:10.040 --> 06:12.102
"LET'S NOT GIVE IT TO
THE DOG RECITING SHAKESPEARE.

06:12.102 --> 06:14.144
HIS PERFORMANCE
WAS A BIG BROAD."

06:14.144 --> 06:17.448
STAN,
THAT'S STILL TALKING.

06:17.448 --> 06:19.009
OH.

06:19.009 --> 06:21.111
I'VE GOT AN EVEN BETTER IDEA.

06:21.111 --> 06:25.786
♪ SHE WAS GROOMED AND SHAVED
TO LOOK LIKE A GODDESS ♪

06:25.786 --> 06:29.420
♪ WITH COMELY CURVES
COMPRISING HER BODICE ♪

06:29.420 --> 06:32.963

06:36.697 --> 06:39.800

06:39.800 --> 06:44.735
♪ SHE MAKES ME GO WOOOOOF ♪♪

06:44.735 --> 06:47.478
YEAH, TRY THE KIBBLE.

06:47.478 --> 06:48.839
NO!!!
NO!!!

06:48.839 --> 06:51.642
I'M NOT TALKING,
I'M SINGING.

06:51.642 --> 06:53.744
OH...RIGHT.

06:56.447 --> 06:57.588
PERFECT.

06:57.588 --> 06:59.750
ALL RIGHT...POSTED.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.091
HEY, SWEETHEART.

07:01.091 --> 07:03.093
HEY! WHAT? NOTHING.
I'M DOING HOMEWORK.

07:03.093 --> 07:07.157
OKAY. SO, WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF MY TALK THIS MORNING?

07:07.157 --> 07:09.830
GREAT. I LEARNED SO MUCH
ABOUT INTERNET SAFETY.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.031
Computer: BUDDY BOP.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.202
WHAT WAS THAT?
WHAT WAS WHAT?

07:12.202 --> 07:13.534
BUDDY BOP.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.165
THAT SOUND.

07:15.165 --> 07:17.007
AVERY, ARE YOU ON
THAT SOCIAL NETWORK SITE--

07:17.007 --> 07:18.609
WHAT'S IT CALLED?
BUDDY BOP.

07:20.110 --> 07:23.213
WHEN YOU MINIMIZE THE SCREEN,
IT SHOULD MINIMIZE THE SOUND!

07:23.213 --> 07:26.617
AVERY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WENT BEHIND OUR BACKS
AND DEFIED US!

07:26.617 --> 07:29.179
YOU ALWAYS FOLLOW THE RULES.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?

07:29.179 --> 07:32.883
EXACTLY! I'M A GOOD KID!
I DON'T DO ANYTHING WRONG!

07:32.883 --> 07:35.455
SO YOU SHOULD TRUST ME
TO BE RESPONSIBLE ONLINE.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.658
HONEY, IT'S NOT THAT
WE DON'T TRUST YOU.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.760
WE DON'T TRUST THE OTHER PEOPLE
WHO ARE OUT THERE.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.533
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
THESE RULES IN OUR FAMILY.

07:42.533 --> 07:44.595
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHO YOU'RE GONNA MEET
ON THE INTERNET.

07:44.595 --> 07:48.699
YOU MET MOM ON THE INTERNET.
WHEN I WAS FORTY.

07:48.699 --> 07:51.772
YOUR PROFILE SAID
YOU WERE THIRTY-EIGHT.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.974
CAN WE PLEASE GET
BACK ON TRACK HERE,

07:53.974 --> 07:56.176
"OUTDOORSY FREE SPIRIT
WITH NO KIDS"?

07:58.509 --> 08:01.481
YOU WILL MAKE BETTER DECISIONS
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.953
DAD, IT'S NOT FAIR!

08:02.953 --> 08:06.557
I'M THE ONLY KID IN MY GRADE
WHO'S NOT ALLOWED ON BUDDYBOP!

08:06.557 --> 08:09.760
AND JUST BECAUSE MY DAD
IS "THE INTERNET SHERIFF."

08:09.760 --> 08:11.922
I WANT YOUR COMPUTER,
AND YOUR PHONE,

08:11.922 --> 08:14.665
AND YOUR BUDDYBOP PASSWORD
SO WE CAN SHUT DOWN
YOUR ACCOUNT.

08:14.665 --> 08:17.267
WE'LL DISCUSS THE REST
OF YOUR PUNISHMENT LATER.
UHH!!!

08:18.699 --> 08:20.531
( sighs )

08:22.172 --> 08:24.535
THEY CALL ME "THE SHERIFF."

08:31.281 --> 08:31.982
Chloe: OKAY...

08:31.982 --> 08:34.014
THIS IS DEFINITELY GONNA
WIN US THE TALENT SHOW.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.886
READY TO REHEARSE?
READY!

08:47.197 --> 08:49.930
Tyler: NO, THIS LOOKS COOL
WHEN THEY DO IT ON THE INTERNET.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.762
IN PERSON IT'S JUST WEIRD.

08:51.762 --> 08:54.605
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT IS WEIRD.

08:54.605 --> 08:57.608
DON'T YOU HAVE ANOTHER TALENT
BESIDE TALKING?

08:57.608 --> 08:59.940
THERE IS ONE GIFT I POSSESS,

08:59.940 --> 09:01.912
BUT I DARE NOT SPEAK ITS NAME.

09:01.912 --> 09:04.845
TANGO. DARN! I SPOKE IT'S NAME!

09:04.845 --> 09:06.947
TANGO? YOU MEAN, LIKE DANCING?

09:06.947 --> 09:09.549
NO! (laughs) IT'S NOTHING LIKE--

09:09.549 --> 09:10.821
OH, WAIT, YOU SAID DANCING?

09:10.821 --> 09:12.823
THEN YES.

09:12.823 --> 09:14.985
SO YOU'LL DO THAT
FOR THE TALENT SHOW?

09:14.985 --> 09:19.590
NO. SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED
AND I WILL NEVER AGAIN
HOLD A ROSE IN MY TEETH.

09:19.590 --> 09:21.832
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU TANGO.

09:21.832 --> 09:25.095
DANG IT! I SAID "TANGO" AGAIN!

09:25.095 --> 09:29.099
I MEAN, WHEN YOU DANCE
THAT ALLURING DANCE, TANGO--

09:29.099 --> 09:30.300
DANG IT!!!

09:32.242 --> 09:33.904
SO WHAT NOW?

09:33.904 --> 09:35.646
LET'S THINK ABOUT IT
OVER LUNCH.

09:41.712 --> 09:43.654
HEY, MOMMY.

09:43.654 --> 09:44.855
LOOKIN' GOOD.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.660
OH...

09:51.862 --> 09:53.894
HEY, HON, YOU REMEMBER
WHEN I GOT MY NEW PHONE

09:53.894 --> 09:55.926
AND WE TOOK SILLY PICTURES
OF OURSELVES?

10:03.133 --> 10:06.006
THE PICTURES YOU PROMISED
YOU WOULD DELETE?

10:06.006 --> 10:08.078
YEAH, THESE.

10:08.078 --> 10:11.942
YOU SAID THEY MADE ME LOOK LIKE
A CONSTIPATED HOWLER MONKEY.

10:11.942 --> 10:15.315
I NEVER SAID THAT.
SOME OF THEM MADE YOU
LOOK CONSTIPATED,

10:15.315 --> 10:17.918
SOME OF THEM MADE YOU
LOOK LIKE A HOWLER MONKEY.

10:17.918 --> 10:21.121
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD
A CONSTIPATED HOWLER MONKEY
EVEN LOOK LIKE?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.723
OH, HERE.

10:23.794 --> 10:25.395
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
DOING WITH THESE?

10:25.395 --> 10:29.660
I'M TEACHING AVERY A LESSON
ABOUT THE DOWNSIDE
OF SOCIAL NETWORKING.

10:29.660 --> 10:31.902
INSTEAD OF CLOSING
HER BUDDYBOP PAGE,

10:31.902 --> 10:33.934
I POSTED THESE PICTURES
ON IT.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.836
OH, BENNETT,
NOW YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.307
THIS IS REALLY GOING TO
EMBARRASS HER.

10:37.307 --> 10:39.810
WELL, I'D RATHER HER BE
A LITTLE EMBARRASSED NOW

10:39.810 --> 10:42.212
THAN BE IN REAL DANGER LATER
FROM A BAD DECISION.

10:42.212 --> 10:44.915
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WORSE--
YOU NOT DELETING THESE

10:44.915 --> 10:47.247
OR USING ME AS A WEAPON
AGAINST OUR DAUGHTER.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.920
I USED BOTH OF US!
IT'S A DOUBLE-BARREL!

10:49.920 --> 10:52.652
KIND OF LIKE YOUR NOSE
IN THIS PICTURE.

10:53.684 --> 10:55.055
AND "DELETE."

10:58.929 --> 11:00.961
CHASE YOUR TAIL!

11:00.961 --> 11:03.934
( barking, growling )
CHASE YOUR TAIL!

11:03.934 --> 11:07.337
THIS IS GONNA BE
OUR BIG FINISH:
COMMANDO CRAWL!

11:11.241 --> 11:14.905
WHOA! REMEMBER, BUDDY,
THIS IS JUST
THE DRESS REHEARSAL.

11:14.905 --> 11:16.947
SAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR TONIGHT.

11:16.947 --> 11:18.378
THERE'S YOUR WINNER
RIGHT THERE!

11:18.378 --> 11:21.081
YEAH, YOU MAY AS WELL TELL
THE OTHER ACTS TO GO HOME.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.152
( barking )

11:22.152 --> 11:23.754
( onlookers gasping )

11:26.216 --> 11:29.219
SERIOUSLY, COULD YOU PLEASE
TELL THEM TO GO HOME?

11:29.219 --> 11:31.691
Stan: THOSE AREN'T DOGS--

11:31.691 --> 11:33.423
THEY'RE SMALL, HAIRY ACROBATS!

11:36.997 --> 11:39.129
FLIP! FLIP!

11:39.129 --> 11:41.431
( grunting )

11:41.431 --> 11:43.173
GIVE IT UP. WE'RE TOAST.

11:43.173 --> 11:45.005
WE'RE GONNA BE
LAUGHED OFF THE STAGE.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.877
NOT IF I--
TANGO?

11:46.877 --> 11:49.940
I WAS GONNA SAY JUMP THROUGH
A FLAMING HOOP WHILE
PLAYING THE ACCORDION.

11:49.940 --> 11:53.784
YOU CAN DO THAT?!
NO, BUT WOULDN'T IT
BE GREAT?

11:53.784 --> 11:57.748
PLEASE, STAN,
YOU'VE GOTTA TANGO.
IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE.

11:57.748 --> 11:59.890
FINE. I'LL TANGO.
YES!

11:59.890 --> 12:02.492
I'M GONNA NEED A SPARKLY SHIRT,
STRAIGHT-CUT TROUSERS,

12:02.492 --> 12:04.354
THREE POODLES AND A ROSE.

12:04.354 --> 12:05.996
WAIT. WHAT ARE
THE POODLES FOR?

12:05.996 --> 12:09.199
YOU DON'T THINK I'M GOING
TO THE AFTER-PARTY ALONE, DO YA?

12:12.863 --> 12:16.106
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
SO EMBARRASSED IN MY LIFE.

12:16.106 --> 12:19.209
THANKS TO THOSE STUPID PICTURES
THAT YOU GUYS POSTED
ON MY PAGE,

12:19.209 --> 12:21.241
NO ONE WOULD
SIT WITH ME AT LUNCH--

12:21.241 --> 12:24.875
NOT EVEN DIRTY MYRON,
WHO HAS EARTHWORMS
LIVING IN HIS HAIR!

12:26.246 --> 12:28.879
I WOULDN'T SIT WITH HER
EITHER. SORRY.

12:28.879 --> 12:31.381
SOMETIMES I JUST WANT
SO BADLY TO FIT IN...

12:31.381 --> 12:33.924
YET I KEEP WEARING THE HATS.

12:33.924 --> 12:36.056
WELL, I'M SORRY
YOU HAD A BAD DAY,

12:36.056 --> 12:37.988
BUT I HOPE YOU
LEARNED YOUR LESSON.

12:37.988 --> 12:41.531
I DID. I'LL NEVER DO
ANYTHING LIKE THAT EVER AGAIN.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.266
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT
TO OUR DAUGHTER!

12:46.266 --> 12:48.098
YOU HAVE CRUSHED
HER SPIRIT!

12:48.098 --> 12:50.140
( delighted shrieking )

12:50.140 --> 12:53.303
I CAN'T BELIEVE
MY PARENTS THOUGHT THAT
I WAS REALLY EMBARRASSED!

12:53.303 --> 12:56.246
OR THAT I REALLY HAVE DOUBTS
ABOUT MY HATS!

12:56.246 --> 12:59.810
THEY HAVE NO IDEA
THEY'RE THE ONES
EVERYONE'S LAUGHING AT.

12:59.810 --> 13:01.381
( all laughing )

13:01.381 --> 13:03.814
AVERY, YOUR PARENTS
ARE SO LAME!

13:03.814 --> 13:05.415
I KNOW!
HA HA HA!

13:08.018 --> 13:09.990
YOU JUST HIGH-FIVED
DIRTY MYRON.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.561
(sniffs) I KNOW.

13:11.561 --> 13:14.324
NOW MY HAND SMELLS
LIKE A FOOT!

13:16.426 --> 13:18.969
BENNETT! I FIXED EVERYTHING!
COME SEE!

13:18.969 --> 13:22.833
THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT AVERY
BEING EMBARRASSED AT SCHOOL,
THE MORE UPSET I GOT,

13:22.833 --> 13:24.975
SO I POSTED THIS
ON HER PAGE.

13:24.975 --> 13:26.977
Computer: BUDDY BOP.
OOH. LOOKS LIKE YOUR PARENTS

13:26.977 --> 13:28.979
POSTED SOMETHING ELSE
TO YOUR PAGE.
COOL!

13:28.979 --> 13:32.442
LET'S SEE WHAT
WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING FUN OF
AT SCHOOL TOMORROW.

13:32.442 --> 13:35.215
THIS IS A MESSAGE
FROM AVERY'S MAMA BEAR

13:35.215 --> 13:37.918
TO ANYONE WHO WOULDN'T SIT
WITH MY LITTLE GIRL AT LUNCH.

13:38.949 --> 13:40.390
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

13:40.390 --> 13:42.392
YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT
IF YOU KNEW HER LIKE I DO.

13:42.392 --> 13:44.554
SHE'S SWEET, SHE'S GENTLE,

13:44.554 --> 13:47.197
WHEN SHE WAS A BABY
I USED TO CALL HER
MY LITTLE A-BUNNY

13:47.197 --> 13:49.399
'CAUSE HER LITTLE BOTTOM
LOOKED JUST LIKE
A LITTLE COTTON TAIL

13:49.399 --> 13:51.962
AND HER POOPS LOOKED LIKE
TINY LITTLE RAISINS.

13:51.962 --> 13:53.934
AAAH!
WHAT DID I DO?!

13:53.934 --> 13:56.506
AAAH! WHAT DID SHE DO?!!!

14:03.443 --> 14:05.545
ELLEN, THIS IS
TEN TIMES WORSE

14:05.545 --> 14:06.846
THAN THE PICTURES I POSTED!

14:06.846 --> 14:08.448
I WAS UPSET! I DIDN'T
THINK IT THROUGH!

14:08.448 --> 14:10.981
HELP ME GET THIS OFF HERE!
HOW DO YOU UNPOST?

14:10.981 --> 14:13.283
I DON'T KNOW!
IF AVERY'S FRIENDS SEE THIS...

14:13.283 --> 14:15.255
...I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO SHOW MY FACE AGAIN!

14:15.255 --> 14:17.857
DID YOU REALLY POOP
LITTLE RAISINS?

14:17.857 --> 14:20.060
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT MY MOM IS...

14:20.060 --> 14:22.232
...THE CRAZY MOM WHO POSTED
THE EMBARRASSING VIDEO.

14:22.232 --> 14:24.164
LOOK OUT! HERE COMES CRAZY MOM!

14:24.164 --> 14:25.495
MWAAAHHH!

14:25.495 --> 14:27.537
I THINK YOU JUST RECORDED THAT.
NO!!!

14:27.537 --> 14:29.399
I THINK YOU JUST
POSTED IT!

14:29.399 --> 14:31.341
AAAAH!
AAAAH!

14:31.341 --> 14:32.642
AAAAH!
AAAHH!

14:32.642 --> 14:35.575
WHAT IS SHE
DOING TO ME?!

14:35.575 --> 14:37.377
IT'LL BE FINE,
WE'LL JUST, UM,

14:37.377 --> 14:40.080
DELETE THE PAGE
BEFORE ANYONE SEES IT.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.382
Computer: BUDDY BOP. BUDDY BOP.
BUDDY BOP. BUDDY BOP.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.084
NO!!!
NO!!!

14:44.084 --> 14:46.316
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
WE DON'T KNOW!

14:46.316 --> 14:48.558
WELL, STOP!!!
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO WORK THIS!

14:48.558 --> 14:50.991
IT'S LIKE WHEN I RENTED
THE POWER HEDGE CLIPPERS--

14:50.991 --> 14:53.323
THE JOHNSONS STILL THINK
THEIR SON SHAVED THEIR CAT.

14:53.323 --> 14:55.095
YOU JUST POSTED THAT!

14:55.095 --> 14:57.067
WHAT?!!!
AAAH!

14:57.067 --> 14:59.099
TURNING OFF THE MONITOR
DOES NOTHING!

15:01.001 --> 15:03.373
FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE
HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT.

15:03.373 --> 15:06.206
WOW, THE INTERNET
IS A REALLY FAST
AND EFFICIENT WAY

15:06.206 --> 15:08.378
TO DISSEMINATE INFORMATION!

15:08.378 --> 15:10.380
OKAY, THERE.
MY PAGE IS DELETED.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.342
AS IS MY LIFE.

15:14.514 --> 15:17.017
LINDSAY,
I'LL SEE YA TOMORROW.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.020
OH, YOU'RE...COMING TO
SCHOOL TOMORROW? WOW.

15:22.492 --> 15:24.694
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

15:24.694 --> 15:26.496
NO ONE'S GONNA WANT TO
HANG OUT WITH ME,

15:26.496 --> 15:28.098
I'LL NEVER HAVE A BOYFRIEND,

15:28.098 --> 15:29.629
I'LL END UP MARRIED
TO DIRTY MYRON

15:29.629 --> 15:31.661
AND YOU'LL END UP
WITH DIRTY GRANDCHILDREN.

15:31.661 --> 15:34.634
AND WE WILL LOVE THEM
JUST THE SAME.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.706
YOU RUINED MY LIFE!

15:36.706 --> 15:38.268
YOU RUINED
YOUR OWN LIFE.

15:38.268 --> 15:39.669
THIS NEVER EVEN
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

15:39.669 --> 15:42.412
IF YOU HADN'T GONE ON THAT
BUDDYBOP IN THE FIRST PLACE.

15:42.412 --> 15:43.673
YEAH, TAKE SOME
RESPONSIBILITY.

15:43.673 --> 15:47.317
I AM NEVER SPEAKING
TO YOU AGAIN.

15:47.317 --> 15:49.179
EXCEPT TO SAY THIS:

15:49.179 --> 15:52.352
WHAT'S FOR DINNER,
AND DID YOU PICK UP MY TIES
FROM THE DRY CLEANERS?

15:52.352 --> 15:53.483

I CAN'T. I THOUGHT
I COULD DO IT, BUT I CAN'T.

16:56.646 --> 17:00.320
THE TASTE OF THE ROSE

TOO MANY MEMORIES.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.308
WE WERE DANCING UP A STORM.

17:19.769 --> 17:21.611
AND THEN, IT HAPPENED--

17:21.611 --> 17:24.274
SHE SNEEZED,
AND MY PANTS FLEW OFF!

17:25.415 --> 17:27.817
EVERYONE LAUGHED.
PARENTS WROTE LETTERS.

17:29.319 --> 17:31.121
I'VE NEVER BEEN
SO HUMILIATED.

17:31.121 --> 17:33.783
BUT STAN,
YOU NEVER WEAR PANTS.

17:33.783 --> 17:37.387
NOT ANYMORE.
NOT AFTER THAT NIGHT.

SOME STUPID TALENT SHOW.

17:47.367 --> 17:51.171

THIS FEAR NOW,
IT'LL HAUNT YOU FOREVER.

19:19.329 --> 19:21.791
HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY?
WAS EVERYONE TALKING
ABOUT THE VIDEO?

19:21.791 --> 19:23.893
YEAH, THEY CALLED ME A-BUNNY,

19:23.893 --> 19:27.397
AND WHEREVER I WENT,
PEOPLE DROPPED RAISINS
BEHIND ME.

19:27.397 --> 19:30.440
BUT THEN 23 KIDS
THREW UP AT LUNCH,

19:30.440 --> 19:32.572
WHICH CHANGED THE TOPIC
OF CONVERSATION.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.844
THANK YOU, EXPIRED MILK!

19:34.844 --> 19:37.377
AH, SO YOU'RE TALKING
TO ME AGAIN.

19:38.908 --> 19:42.252
I JUST GOT OVER
TWO DOZEN EMAILS
FROM OUR FRIENDS

19:42.252 --> 19:44.354
ABOUT ALL THOSE EMBARRASSING
PICTURES I POSTED.

19:44.354 --> 19:46.416
THEY WERE SUPPOSED
TO EMBARRASS AVERY,
NOT US.

19:46.416 --> 19:49.359
YOU KNOW, WE HAD
A GREAT LECTURE
AT SCHOOL.

19:49.359 --> 19:51.721
THE EXPERT SAID,
"WHEN YOU POST
SOMETHING ONLINE,

19:51.721 --> 19:53.223
YOU LOSE CONTROL OVER IT."

19:53.223 --> 19:55.465
WHY DIDN'T I LISTEN TO ME?

19:55.465 --> 19:59.229
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS,
I'VE BEEN THINKING,

19:59.229 --> 20:01.571
AND I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

20:01.571 --> 20:04.434
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE JOINED
BUDDYBOP AND BROKEN YOUR RULE.

20:04.434 --> 20:06.636
IT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE
AND DISRESPECTFUL.

20:06.636 --> 20:09.779
ARE YOU JUST SAYING THIS
BECAUSE YOU WANT YOUR PHONE
AND COMPUTER BACK?

20:09.779 --> 20:10.840
MOSTLY.

20:12.342 --> 20:13.643
DO I GET POINTS
FOR BEING HONEST?

20:13.643 --> 20:15.985
LISTEN, AVERY,
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND

20:15.985 --> 20:17.617
THAT OUR RULES
ABOUT THE INTERNET

20:17.617 --> 20:19.419
ARE TO PROTECT YOU.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.620
HE'S RIGHT, SWEETHEART.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.952
EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE
HAS COME FROM LOVE--

20:22.952 --> 20:25.555
LOVE AND FEAR--
AND A LITTLE BIT OF IGNORANCE--

20:25.555 --> 20:27.497
BUT MOSTLY LOVE.

20:27.497 --> 20:29.259
I KNOW.

20:29.259 --> 20:30.930
AND I'LL FOLLOW YOUR RULES.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.333
PARTLY BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR ME,

20:33.333 --> 20:35.435
AND PARTLY BECAUSE
YOU'RE SO CRAZY,

20:35.435 --> 20:36.636
IF I GO BEHIND YOUR BACKS AGAIN

20:36.636 --> 20:38.668
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT YOU'LL DO.

20:38.668 --> 20:40.970
JUST KNOWING YOUR DAUGHTER
FEELS THAT WAY

20:40.970 --> 20:43.012
IS ALL A MOTHER COULD ASK.

20:43.012 --> 20:47.677
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE
LEFT ALL THIS UNOPENED MILK
IN THE CAFETERIA?

20:47.677 --> 20:49.319
SCORE!

20:51.821 --> 20:54.253
Stan:
THE NIGHT OF THE TALENT SHOW
I DANCED

20:54.253 --> 20:56.356
AS I HAD NEVER DANCED BEFORE.

20:56.356 --> 21:00.360
I PUT THE PAST BEHIND ME--
IT WAS GLORIOUS!

21:00.360 --> 21:02.362
UNTIL I LOST
TO A TALKING DOG.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.035
HELLO. I LOVE YOU.

21:09.739 --> 21:11.741
EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS SO CUTE

21:11.741 --> 21:13.473
SO HE LOOKED LIKE
HE WAS TALKING.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.274
THAT'S NOT TALKING!

21:15.274 --> 21:17.307
AND WHEN I RAN INTO HIM
BACKSTAGE AFTER,

21:17.307 --> 21:19.479
HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
MORE SNOTTY ABOUT IT.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.880
I LOVE YOU.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.653
HOW CAN YOU LOVE ME?
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

21:23.653 --> 21:25.315
I LOVE YOU.

21:25.315 --> 21:27.557
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT LOVE IS!

21:27.557 --> 21:28.758
I LOVE YOU!

21:28.758 --> 21:31.821
YOU DON'T LOVE ME.
YOU LOVE THE IDEA OF ME.

21:31.821 --> 21:33.493
I LOVE YOU.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.895
OKAY, I LOVE YOU TOO.

21:39.599 --> 21:40.600
