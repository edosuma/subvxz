WEBVTT

00:18.686 --> 00:20.253
<i>So, there I am.</i>

00:20.287 --> 00:22.657
Down on one knee
in the sand,

00:22.690 --> 00:25.627
almost exactly where
I had been seven years before,

00:25.660 --> 00:27.394
kissing her.

00:27.427 --> 00:29.396
Waves crashing
in the background,

00:29.429 --> 00:33.333
the sun glistening into her
strikingly beautiful green eyes.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.269
And I'm holding up
a diamond ring,

00:36.303 --> 00:38.405
asking her to marry me,

00:38.438 --> 00:39.607
which I'd saved up for

00:39.641 --> 00:41.508
for three fucking years,
by the way.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.577
After 15 minutes
of pouring my soul out,

00:43.611 --> 00:45.847
telling her
how wonderful she is

00:45.880 --> 00:48.515
and how wonderful
our lives now make sense

00:48.548 --> 00:51.551
and how... and how... and how...
and how... and how our future is

00:51.585 --> 00:53.855
nothing but a big shiny,
bright spot.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.393
I mean,
what would you say?

00:59.426 --> 01:00.862
You'd say something?

01:00.895 --> 01:02.964
But, no, no, no.
Nothing.

01:02.997 --> 01:06.199
Like, nothing at all.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.704
Like, just crickets.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.873
And then tears.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.240
Tears streaming
down my face,

01:13.273 --> 01:15.208
but these are not
tears of joy.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.644
No.

01:16.678 --> 01:18.880
These are not tears of,
"Oh, my God,

01:18.913 --> 01:20.715
now our lives
make sense together

01:20.748 --> 01:21.983
and we're gonna
have four kids

01:22.016 --> 01:24.484
and we're gonna
live in Seattle."

01:24.518 --> 01:25.887
No.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.789
These are, "How about
I open up your chest,

01:27.822 --> 01:30.424
I take a big fat fucking shit
inside of it,

01:30.457 --> 01:31.926
I zip it up, I wrap you up
in duct tape,

01:31.959 --> 01:34.428
I put you on a chair,
I put a noose around your neck,

01:34.461 --> 01:39.499
and then I kick the chair
out from underneath you" tears.

01:39.533 --> 01:43.303
Because, you know what?
She goes, "I met someone new.

01:43.336 --> 01:47.307
I met someone with a little more
stability," she said.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.242
She goes, "How are you
gonna take care of me

01:49.276 --> 01:51.378
when I'm pregnant?"

01:51.411 --> 01:55.750
Um, what was the rent
for the room again?

01:55.783 --> 01:57.852
Oh, right.
Right, right.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.755
So, basically it's
a thousand bucks, flat out.

02:03.725 --> 02:06.359
Okay, uh, that's actually
not too bad.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.465
I'm gonna pass.

02:11.498 --> 02:12.667
Great.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.434
Okay.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.970
Great.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.839
I'm just gonna...

02:17.872 --> 02:19.439
I'm gonna go.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.648
Oh, of course
you're gonna pass,

02:27.682 --> 02:30.818
you fucking soul-sucking-Shiva
of a whore!

02:30.852 --> 02:32.552
Why don't you just
go ahead and nut tap

02:32.586 --> 02:34.889
poor ol' Greg's testes
and rip out his uvula

02:34.922 --> 02:36.423
while you're at it!

02:36.456 --> 02:43.530
Get in line,
you fucking blonde cracker!

02:43.563 --> 02:45.332
Hey, Ms. Dalton.

02:45.365 --> 02:46.433
It's good to see you
this morning.

02:46.466 --> 02:49.536
Hey!

02:49.569 --> 02:51.806
Love that new landscape!

02:51.839 --> 02:53.641
Killer perennials.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.879
<i>Once upon a time,
a poor aspiring writer</i>

04:04.912 --> 04:07.682
<i>named Greg
was drowning in heartbreak.</i>

04:07.715 --> 04:09.516
<i>The love of his life, Ashley,</i>

04:09.549 --> 04:11.085
<i>had just fucked the shit</i>

04:11.118 --> 04:13.621
<i>out of their couples
therapist, Dr. Wilbon.</i>

04:13.654 --> 04:15.723
<i>This begins
the sad, sad tale</i>

04:15.756 --> 04:19.060
<i>of a hopeless love addict
trying to find love once again.</i>

04:19.093 --> 04:22.730
<i>And along the way,
a roommate, too.</i>

04:34.141 --> 04:36.844
Greg, it's your sister.
Wake up.

04:45.485 --> 04:46.621
Oh.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.189
There it is.

04:57.098 --> 04:59.667
Argh.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.468
Oh, God, it's you.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.743
Mom said you still
can't find a roommate?

05:08.776 --> 05:11.646
Yeah, not yet.

05:11.679 --> 05:12.847
I'm being selective.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.048
Yeah.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.783
Oh, hey, by the way, Greg.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.053
Dan and I are having a little
dinner party on Saturday

05:19.086 --> 05:20.621
and I really think
you should come.

05:20.655 --> 05:22.657
Mm, I don't know.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.959
I'm kind of on the fence
about human beings right now.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.459
Oh, speaking of human beings,

05:26.493 --> 05:28.696
please do not miss
your 3:00 p.m. workout

05:28.729 --> 05:30.197
with my trainer, Hector.

05:30.231 --> 05:31.732
Oh, fuck me real hard.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.500
Jules, I thought
we rescheduled that.

05:33.533 --> 05:36.771
No, we didn't reschedule that.
You need the endorphins.

05:36.804 --> 05:40.675
Oh, God damn it, Jules.
No, I don't need endorphins.

05:40.708 --> 05:41.842
I'm fine.

05:44.979 --> 05:46.881
You're a mess, Greg.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.617
And you should stop...
just stop drinking that,

05:49.650 --> 05:51.518
unless you want to puke
your nuts out at your session.

05:51.551 --> 05:53.154
Please.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.990
Pfft, how hard could this Hector
guy's workout possibly be?

06:02.897 --> 06:04.832
I want 20 push-ups,
soldier.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.135
Oh, my God.
Soldier?

06:08.169 --> 06:10.671
Think I am...
think I'm...

06:10.705 --> 06:13.506
Oh, my God, I think
I'm gonna have a heart attack.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.675
Get off my squad.

06:14.709 --> 06:15.810
I'm sorry?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.611
Get off my squadron
right now.

06:17.645 --> 06:18.879
Your squad?

06:18.913 --> 06:21.182
I don't want
no pansy-ass

06:21.215 --> 06:23.550
mama's boy
on my squadron.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.219
Get the fuck up.

06:41.736 --> 06:43.536
<i>I'm not a love addict.</i>

06:43.570 --> 06:45.172
No.

06:45.206 --> 06:46.941
It's totally normal
to get emotional

06:46.974 --> 06:48.575
during a romantic comedy.

06:54.682 --> 06:58.652
Mom, how am I supposed
to get a job and a roommate

06:58.686 --> 07:00.688
and work on my writing?

07:00.721 --> 07:04.258
Hmm? You think Dalton Trumbo
was posting craigslist ads

07:04.291 --> 07:06.694
and driving around
in an Uber on the weekends?

07:06.727 --> 07:08.595
No.

07:11.966 --> 07:15.169
Yes, writing is going great.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.575
All right, say hello
to Mary Jane for me.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.914
Love you, too.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.215
Bye.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.180
I'm sleeping
with our couples therapist.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.831
Oh, my God.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.100
Oh.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.008
Oh, my God.

08:29.677 --> 08:30.778
Fuck.

08:34.148 --> 08:36.150
Fuck you, Dr. Wilbon!

08:38.751 --> 08:41.322
So, you had the same
recurring dream last night.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.957
Yes.
Doctors are the worst.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.660
How did that dream make you feel
when you woke up?

08:46.694 --> 08:48.696
Oh, pfft, just wonderful.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.664
I mean, I love the fact
that the love of my life

08:50.698 --> 08:52.833
is fucking
our couples therapist.

08:52.867 --> 08:54.702
You're still in anger phase.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.137
That will subside.

08:56.170 --> 08:58.372
And, Greg, you know
this dream isn't real.

08:58.405 --> 09:01.175
Well, yeah, but her fucking
Dr. Wilbon is very real.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.211
True, that does suck
very badly.

09:04.245 --> 09:05.880
Is that supposed
to be helpful?

09:05.913 --> 09:07.781
Moving right along.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.717
How about you, Doc?
Have you ever fucked a client?

09:09.750 --> 09:13.721
I would never sleep
with a beautiful, sensual,

09:13.754 --> 09:18.092
buttery thighs, breasts
that could dent a man's chest,

09:18.125 --> 09:22.763
vivacious valley,
dimple on her ass...

09:35.009 --> 09:36.076
Doc?

09:36.110 --> 09:37.811
Yes?
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.280
Very sorry.
You were saying?

09:39.313 --> 09:41.815
Yeah, the banging
of a client.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.250
Oh, right, right.
Enough about me.

09:43.284 --> 09:44.752
How are you doing, in general?

09:44.785 --> 09:50.224
I don't know. I mean...

09:50.257 --> 09:51.992
It's a roller coaster
of emotions.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.794
You know, some good days,
some bad days.

09:53.827 --> 09:54.995
Actually, mostly bad days.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.497
Actually, mostly awful days,

09:56.530 --> 09:58.199
like God-awful days.

09:58.232 --> 10:02.002
Like curl-up-in-a-ball
and fall-down-a-deep-dark-well,

10:02.036 --> 10:03.904
shatter-your-spinal-cord-
on-impact-

10:03.938 --> 10:08.042
and-drown-in-six-inches-of-water
awful days.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.376
Let me ask you something, Greg.

10:09.410 --> 10:11.278
Have you been working out
lately,

10:11.312 --> 10:13.914
done any sort
of physical activity?

10:13.948 --> 10:16.016
Oh, God, you don't even
want to know.

10:16.050 --> 10:18.085
You know, Greg,
physical exercise

10:18.118 --> 10:22.189
is a necessary catalyst
in the releasing of endorphins.

10:22.223 --> 10:24.758
What the fuck is it
with these goddamn endorphins?

10:24.792 --> 10:26.260
Fuck!

10:26.293 --> 10:27.528
Fuck you!

10:27.561 --> 10:29.430
I hate endorphins!

10:29.463 --> 10:32.967
I never wanted to fucking
have them in the first place!

10:33.000 --> 10:35.035
Fuck them.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.203
I'm fine.

10:40.841 --> 10:44.778
Odd yet interesting
trigger point of anxiety.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.981
How about male companionship?

10:47.014 --> 10:48.315
Have you taken time
to hang out

10:48.349 --> 10:50.084
with any
of your broheims lately,

10:50.117 --> 10:52.152
since your breakup
with Ashley?

10:52.186 --> 10:53.921
No, I haven't.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.023
Well, then, I suggest
you make time for your homies.

10:56.056 --> 10:59.326
Remember, Gregory,
don't be a wussy

10:59.360 --> 11:00.527
because of the pussy.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.537
This is
the good life, my friend.

11:10.571 --> 11:12.506
Who woulda thought
a couple of young kids

11:12.539 --> 11:15.209
from Upstate New York
would come out west

11:15.242 --> 11:19.013
and absolutely crush it
like we have?

11:19.046 --> 11:20.814
Currently unemployed,
and you're a professional

11:20.848 --> 11:23.183
male house sitter
mooching off celebrities.

11:23.217 --> 11:25.919
Living the dream.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.122
Oh, God.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.990
So, what's going on
with you, man?

11:30.024 --> 11:31.892
You found
your new roommate yet?

11:31.925 --> 11:33.227
No, not yet.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.329
I can't get out
of that two-year lease.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.597
Damn, dude.

11:36.631 --> 11:37.965
How long you been
lookin' for?

11:39.533 --> 11:42.403
It's been 57 days
since Ashley moved out.

11:42.436 --> 11:44.505
Jesus H. What the hell's
taking so long?

11:44.538 --> 11:46.340
I put an ad out
on craigslist,

11:46.373 --> 11:48.475
by the next week, I had already
kicked out a new roommate.

11:48.509 --> 11:50.544
- Why'd you kick 'em out?
- I caught him face-fucking

11:50.577 --> 11:53.580
that gothic gargoyle statue
in the foyer area.

11:53.615 --> 11:55.049
You know, the marble one?

11:55.082 --> 11:56.550
Oh, yeah.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.185
Very nice piece.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.321
Thank you.

12:00.354 --> 12:01.989
I got this new guy,

12:02.022 --> 12:03.991
he's been lickin'
the bathroom mirrors.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.392
Good God.

12:05.426 --> 12:07.227
Where you finding these guys,
OKCupid?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.232
Don't worry about it.

12:12.266 --> 12:13.467
So, what's the problem?

12:13.500 --> 12:14.935
How come you can't
find a roommate?

12:14.968 --> 12:16.403
I don't know,
I just...

12:16.437 --> 12:17.571
I haven't found
the right match, I guess.

12:17.605 --> 12:18.972
Oh, Christ.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.008
What are you doing?

12:21.041 --> 12:23.110
I'm going to give you
some sorely needed

12:23.143 --> 12:24.878
roommate-seeking advice.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.880
That's simply not necessary,
thank you.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.149
Oh, it most certainly is.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.351
Now, for starters,
rule number one.

12:30.384 --> 12:32.019
So, no matter what,

12:32.052 --> 12:33.554
no matter
if Felicia "Vike-ander"

12:33.587 --> 12:35.389
from <i>"Ex-Machine-a"...</i>

12:35.422 --> 12:37.057
Alicia Vikander.

12:37.091 --> 12:39.393
Alicia Vikander
from <i>Ex-Machina.</i>

12:39.426 --> 12:41.995
No matter
if Felicia "Vike-ander"

12:42.029 --> 12:43.364
from <i>"Ex-Machine-a"</i>
shows up...

12:43.397 --> 12:45.966
No!
Alicia Vikander.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.968
If Felicia "Vike-ander"...

12:48.001 --> 12:49.903
Alicia Vikander
from <i>Ex-Machina.</i>

12:49.937 --> 12:52.106
- If Felicia...
- It's not Felicia,

12:52.139 --> 12:54.041
it's Alicia Vikander from...

12:54.074 --> 12:56.276
If Alicia
from <i>The Danish Girl...</i>

12:56.310 --> 12:57.478
Okay.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.179
...shows up at
your front doorstep,

12:59.213 --> 13:01.683
no matter what,
looking for a place to live,

13:01.716 --> 13:04.051
no matter what,
under absolutely

13:04.084 --> 13:06.621
no circumstances whatsoever

13:06.654 --> 13:08.255
can you have
a female roommate.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.624
Why the hell not?

13:09.657 --> 13:11.258
Because you just got
your heart trampled on

13:11.291 --> 13:14.027
really fucking hard, Greg,
really fucking hard,

13:14.061 --> 13:15.362
and because of that,
you probably got

13:15.396 --> 13:17.197
some latent anger
very deep inside

13:17.231 --> 13:18.532
that cold, bitter
heart of yours,

13:18.565 --> 13:20.200
toward the female species.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.670
- That's just simply not true.
- Is that so?

13:22.704 --> 13:24.405
I thoroughly enjoy
the company of a fine female.

13:24.438 --> 13:25.707
I was raised by two of them,
for Christ's sake.

13:25.740 --> 13:27.408
- Is that so?
- Yes.

13:27.441 --> 13:30.210
Because I ran
into Mrs. Dalton this week

13:30.244 --> 13:32.146
while she was landscaping
her front yard,

13:32.179 --> 13:33.715
and she told me
that one of the neighbors

13:33.748 --> 13:35.482
called the cops on you

13:35.516 --> 13:37.985
because you were screaming
at some poor girl,

13:38.018 --> 13:42.256
calling her, and I quote,
"a fucking blonde cracker."

13:42.289 --> 13:44.324
End quote.

13:44.358 --> 13:46.427
Mrs. D told you
about that, huh?

13:46.460 --> 13:48.262
Yeah, she did, Greg.

13:49.731 --> 13:51.064
Hey, what'd you think
of her new perennials?

13:51.098 --> 13:52.399
They are quite lovely.

13:52.433 --> 13:55.202
- Aren't they?
- Yes, very much so.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.503
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.

13:56.537 --> 13:58.305
I don't know
if it's the mulch.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.407
I mean, she's the only one
crushing it in this drought.

14:00.441 --> 14:01.442
Yeah.

14:01.475 --> 14:03.010
Her bed is flush as shit.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.111
Oh, it is.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.215
You're fucking her,
aren't you?

14:08.248 --> 14:09.349
I am indeed.

14:09.383 --> 14:10.350
Come on.

14:10.384 --> 14:11.552
You're fucking her.

14:11.585 --> 14:13.621
- Come on.
- Are you fucking her?

14:13.655 --> 14:15.189
- Let's go.
- Oh, my God.

14:15.222 --> 14:18.693
I am. I am.

14:18.726 --> 14:21.361
All right, I am going to be
your potential roommate.

14:21.395 --> 14:23.997
You are going to be you.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.633
Unfortunately,
that's an element

14:25.667 --> 14:27.201
that we can't really
change here, but that's okay.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.502
We'll find a work-around.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.370
I can't do this.
This is so stupid.

14:30.404 --> 14:31.572
Do you like
paying full rent

14:31.606 --> 14:33.474
- and all the bills, Greg?
- Oh, God.

14:37.511 --> 14:40.682
Yo, what's up, dawg?

14:40.715 --> 14:42.617
- Really, Greg?
- What?

14:42.650 --> 14:45.185
What are you, like,
a 35-year-old Justin Bieber?

14:45.219 --> 14:47.287
- What? What'd I say?
- "Yo, what's up, dawg"?

14:47.321 --> 14:49.089
Out of all the ways that you
could possibly greet somebody,

14:49.122 --> 14:50.725
that's what you go with?

14:50.758 --> 14:52.359
What's wrong with that?
That's how I talk to dudes.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.762
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

14:58.733 --> 15:01.134
Hello there,
fine gentleman.

15:01.168 --> 15:04.639
All right, now you seem like
you just want to sodomize me.

15:04.672 --> 15:06.440
Well, fuck, dude.
What do you want me to say?

15:06.473 --> 15:08.208
How about more
nice, normal guy?

15:08.242 --> 15:11.278
Less creepy
Jared-from-Subway guy.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.614
Yes, less creepy,
Subway, got it.

15:12.647 --> 15:14.314
All right.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.688
Howdy, partner,
it's nice to meet ya.

15:23.625 --> 15:24.591
What?

15:26.126 --> 15:27.594
<i>Greg knew Paul was right.</i>

15:27.629 --> 15:29.229
<i>He headed off
to his sister's party</i>

15:29.263 --> 15:31.833
<i>hoping to find
a male roommate.</i>

15:31.866 --> 15:34.234
<i>But she
and her boyfriend, Dan,</i>

15:34.268 --> 15:36.604
<i>who has been acting
a little fucking weird</i>

15:36.638 --> 15:39.707
<i>ever since suffering a serious
head injury while skiing,</i>

15:39.741 --> 15:42.242
<i>had other plans.</i>

15:50.652 --> 15:53.453
No, no, the Bosu ball
is great for the bedroom.

15:53.487 --> 15:55.455
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.227
Oh, hey.
Hector.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.732
It's a pleasure to...
what a surprise.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.835
Oh, you shaved
your head, man.

16:07.869 --> 16:10.672
That is... soldier style, huh?
Nice.

16:14.575 --> 16:16.343
Well, it's good
to see you, man.

16:18.613 --> 16:20.113
Those pecs are firm.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.685
You not on my squad.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.898
Well, that wasn't awkward.

16:36.931 --> 16:38.498
Well, I threw up
all over his shoes.

16:38.532 --> 16:40.167
- I heard.
- Like, all over 'em.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.604
- Laces and everything.
- I heard that, too.

16:42.637 --> 16:44.137
Oh, I brought you something.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.841
Oh, wow, Greg.
You shouldn't have.

16:46.874 --> 16:48.810
I don't even know why
I bought that Opus One

16:48.843 --> 16:50.243
- when we have this.
- Yeah.

16:50.277 --> 16:53.815
Oh, yeah. Gregorino.

16:53.848 --> 16:55.750
Hey, man, thank you
so much for coming.

16:55.783 --> 16:57.752
- This is cool.
- Yeah.

16:57.785 --> 17:00.420
Dan, he's... he's depressed.
He's not a deaf foster child.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.624
- Okay.
- Jules, I'm not depressed.

17:02.657 --> 17:04.191
Oh, you know what I mean.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.592
Look at this.

17:05.627 --> 17:08.362
Greg bought us
this box of, I think...

17:08.395 --> 17:11.598
This is outstanding.
We love it.

17:11.633 --> 17:12.834
It's good.
Have you tried it?

17:12.867 --> 17:15.268
Mm, God, yeah.
We have it all the time.

17:15.301 --> 17:16.671
- It's our favorite.
- Love it.

17:16.704 --> 17:18.906
Wait, I thought you said
you haven't had it.

17:18.940 --> 17:21.709
Anyways, this is hot.

17:21.742 --> 17:23.542
So, where is everybody.
Am I early?

17:23.577 --> 17:27.714
Oh, yeah, um, so,
we sent out the invitations,

17:27.749 --> 17:29.282
but they had
the wrong date on it.

17:29.316 --> 17:32.586
For everybody,
except for you.

17:32.620 --> 17:34.554
And me!

17:34.588 --> 17:36.490
And Wenona!

17:36.523 --> 17:38.492
Hey, you guys
haven't met, have you?

17:38.525 --> 17:40.360
Uh, no, Jules.

17:40.394 --> 17:41.829
Matter of fact,
I don't think we have.

17:43.931 --> 17:44.966
- Fun.
- Fun.

17:44.999 --> 17:46.601
Come on over, Wenona.

17:46.634 --> 17:49.671
Just make yourself at home.

17:49.704 --> 17:52.840
Okay.

17:52.874 --> 17:53.975
Okay!

17:54.008 --> 17:56.376
Yeah, we should
open up this box.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.311
I like that shirt.
I love gray.

17:58.345 --> 17:59.781
- Uh, thanks
- Yeah.

17:59.814 --> 18:01.883
Here we go.
This is cool.

18:04.518 --> 18:07.487
So, Greg, what do you
do for a living?

18:07.521 --> 18:09.523
Well, sis,
it's an interesting question.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.591
Thanks for asking.

18:11.626 --> 18:14.494
Especially since
I'm unemployed.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.798
Oh, shit.
I forgot about that.

18:16.831 --> 18:19.332
Well, what did you
used to do?

18:19.366 --> 18:22.469
Um, I was a production
assistant,

18:22.502 --> 18:25.238
but that was
just to pay the bills.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.541
I really want to, um...
I want to write.

18:27.574 --> 18:30.712
Or I am a writer.
Or I will be.

18:30.745 --> 18:32.379
Hopefully, one day.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.448
That's really rad, dude.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.017
Where were you
a production assistant?

18:36.050 --> 18:39.921
It was a, uh,
The Trailer House.

18:39.954 --> 18:43.725
Oh, my God.
That is so sweet.

18:43.758 --> 18:45.592
Trailer people
need love

18:45.626 --> 18:47.829
just as much as people

18:47.862 --> 18:50.597
with real houses.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.469
It was a movie trailer house.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.805
Oh!

18:57.839 --> 19:01.609
Oh, of course.
That makes so much more sense.

19:01.642 --> 19:03.343
Right.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.412
Yeah, because you wouldn't
want to be surrounded

19:05.445 --> 19:06.948
by trailer people all the time

19:06.981 --> 19:11.418
'cause they smell weird.
Ish.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.822
Well, that's really great
because

19:14.856 --> 19:19.426
I loooovvve
movie trailers!

19:22.329 --> 19:23.597
Cool.

19:23.631 --> 19:25.432
Well, what about you,
Wenona?

19:25.465 --> 19:27.769
Let's hear what's going on
with you

19:27.802 --> 19:30.938
since you left
our accounting firm last year.

19:30.972 --> 19:32.439
Well, I'm actually kind of
in limbo,

19:32.472 --> 19:35.610
but if this lawsuit works out,

19:35.643 --> 19:39.412
I'm thinking of doing
some serious traveling.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.783
You have a lawsuit?

19:41.816 --> 19:44.518
Yup, a, uh...
a sexual harassment lawsuit.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.320
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Oh, Jesus.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.322
Well, Dan and I fucked.

19:49.356 --> 19:53.828
No. No, that's not true.
That's not true.

19:53.861 --> 19:57.031
I wouldn't touch
her dirty ass with your dick.

19:57.064 --> 19:59.499
Dan from work.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.836
- Oh.
- Whoa.

20:01.869 --> 20:05.006
Yeah.
Yeah, Dan from work, maybe.

20:05.039 --> 20:08.341
That's cleared up.
You like that?

20:08.375 --> 20:11.478
Let me get this straight.
You fucked Dan?

20:11.511 --> 20:12.747
Dan, Dan?
As in our boss, Dan?

20:12.780 --> 20:16.583
Yep, during my exit interview.

20:16.617 --> 20:18.753
- Oh, my God.
- It was pretty intense.

20:18.786 --> 20:21.756
That guy is a freak.

20:21.789 --> 20:24.558
I thought maybe I would
get to keep my job

20:24.591 --> 20:28.461
if I let him stick it in-in,
but apparently not.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.965
But double-but,
my attorney thinks

20:30.998 --> 20:33.734
I have a pretty darn good shot
with this lawsuit,

20:33.768 --> 20:36.037
so, fingers crossed.

20:36.070 --> 20:41.976
I mean, that would be
the dream.

20:42.009 --> 20:43.443
Yeah.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.946
- Yay.
- Kudos.

20:48.916 --> 20:51.052
This can't be real.

20:51.085 --> 20:53.020
Oh, hey, you guys
should go out,

20:53.054 --> 20:54.387
the two of you.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.756
Dan!

20:55.790 --> 20:57.524
I promise not to sue.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.028
Well, the chicken's
pretty good, huh?

21:03.097 --> 21:05.532
Yeah.

21:05.565 --> 21:08.135
I've actually never seen her
quite like that before.

21:08.169 --> 21:10.838
<i>And, plus, all my other friends
are either married or in rehab</i>

21:10.872 --> 21:14.574
or there's actually a few
on Ashley Madison, so...

21:14.609 --> 21:16.509
Well, look, I'm not exactly
looking to date

21:16.543 --> 21:19.847
any time soon, despite
Dan's brilliant suggestion.

21:19.881 --> 21:21.616
<i>Well, you know he hasn't
been himself</i>

21:21.649 --> 21:22.984
<i>since the skiing accident.</i>

21:23.017 --> 21:25.119
This is a stew.

21:25.152 --> 21:26.954
That is a chicken.

21:26.988 --> 21:29.190
- Oh, fuck my butt.
- What?

21:29.223 --> 21:30.825
I think I just got an email
about the apartment.

21:30.858 --> 21:32.559
- What's it say?
- "Hey, duder!

21:32.592 --> 21:33.961
Is this room still avail?

21:33.995 --> 21:35.162
I am moving to
the City of Angels tomorrow

21:35.196 --> 21:37.131
and desperately
need a place to reside.

21:37.164 --> 21:39.667
If it is, is it cool
if I PayPal you the money now

21:39.700 --> 21:40.902
for the first month's rent

21:40.935 --> 21:42.535
and swing by
and move in tomorrow?"

21:42.569 --> 21:44.205
The fuck?

21:44.238 --> 21:47.041
"I promise not to be
a serial killer"

21:47.074 --> 21:50.011
dot-dot-dot..."anymore.

21:50.044 --> 21:51.544
JK. Kinda.

21:51.578 --> 21:52.813
But for realz.
Let me know!

21:52.847 --> 21:54.782
Thanks, man."
Smiley face. Peyton.

21:54.815 --> 21:57.952
Hmm. Sounds a little desperate,
perhaps too good to be true,

21:57.985 --> 21:59.921
but you know what? Fuck it.
I say go for it.

21:59.954 --> 22:01.022
I don't know, you think?

22:01.055 --> 22:02.589
Yeah, totally.

22:02.623 --> 22:03.891
Just don't puke on the guy
this time.

22:03.925 --> 22:05.126
Yeah, very funny.

22:05.159 --> 22:06.694
All right, I gotta go.
Love you, bye.

22:06.727 --> 22:08.696
Good-bye.

22:15.102 --> 22:17.104
A hundred and 183 dollars?
What the fuck?

22:17.138 --> 22:19.974
God damn it.
No!

22:20.007 --> 22:22.743
I'm fucked!
I'm so fucked.

22:22.777 --> 22:24.178
No!

22:29.283 --> 22:31.686
I just got a roommate, though.

22:31.719 --> 22:34.855
Yes, I did.

22:34.889 --> 22:37.091
I just got a fuckin' roommate.

22:37.124 --> 22:39.093
Fuck yeah.

22:51.839 --> 22:53.040
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:53.074 --> 22:54.976
- Are you Greg?
- Yeah.

22:55.009 --> 22:56.978
Hi, I'm Peyton.

22:58.145 --> 22:59.613
Hi.

22:59.647 --> 23:00.948
Oh, my God.
You're Peyton.

23:00.982 --> 23:03.250
Yeah, the...
the serial killer.

23:03.284 --> 23:04.517
I'm not a serial killer.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.754
The former serial killer.

23:06.787 --> 23:08.289
- Right.
- Remember? Yeah.

23:08.322 --> 23:09.690
Right, yeah, no.
Right, of course.

23:09.724 --> 23:10.691
- Right.
- No, that's right.

23:10.725 --> 23:12.626
I mean, who is?

23:12.660 --> 23:14.061
You know?
Um, no, I just...

23:14.095 --> 23:16.731
I thought that Peyton
was a boy's name.

23:16.764 --> 23:18.632
- No offense.
- Oh, no, none taken.

23:18.666 --> 23:20.567
Yeah, are you a Broncos fan?

23:20.601 --> 23:22.535
No, I fuckin'
hate them, actually.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.171
Oh.

23:24.205 --> 23:27.141
Well, I was gonna say
the Broncos, Peyton Manning.

23:27.174 --> 23:28.876
Uh, random.

23:28.909 --> 23:30.945
No, because people think
Peyton Manning

23:30.978 --> 23:33.014
and then they think Peyton,
that I'm a guy.

23:33.047 --> 23:34.547
Oh, yes, right.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.884
But, nah, these are...
these are breasts.

23:36.917 --> 23:38.085
Yeah.

23:38.119 --> 23:41.622
And I have a functioning
vagina as well.

23:41.655 --> 23:43.758
Ah!

23:43.791 --> 23:46.127
Gynecologist says top notch.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.628
Looks good.

23:47.661 --> 23:51.699
Is that okay,
that I'm a... a woman?

23:51.732 --> 23:53.300
<i>No matter what,</i>

23:53.334 --> 23:57.004
<i>under absolutely no
circumstances whatsoever</i>

23:57.038 --> 23:59.073
<i>can you have
a female roommate!</i>

23:59.106 --> 24:00.641
No, yeah, it's great.
Come on in.

24:00.674 --> 24:02.777
- Really? Oh.
- Yes. I'm very happy.

24:02.810 --> 24:04.311
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah.

24:04.345 --> 24:05.312
You have great hair.

24:07.615 --> 24:08.949
- Sorry.
- Oh.

24:08.983 --> 24:10.718
- It's sticky.
- Oh.

24:10.751 --> 24:12.920
- Oh, wow.
- So, yeah, this is your room.

24:12.953 --> 24:14.255
This is...
this is perfect.

24:14.288 --> 24:16.791
Yeah.
This is very purple.

24:16.824 --> 24:18.059
Yep.

24:18.092 --> 24:19.693
I love it, though.

24:19.727 --> 24:21.762
I call it
the purple monster.

24:21.796 --> 24:23.130
Well, I like it.

24:23.164 --> 24:24.632
- It's my favorite color.
- Oh.

24:24.665 --> 24:26.233
A mixture of red and blue.

24:26.267 --> 24:27.835
Oh.
Are you gay?

24:27.868 --> 24:31.172
- No. Are you?
- Oh. No.

24:31.205 --> 24:32.840
Great. Yeah.

24:32.873 --> 24:35.810
Cool. It's ex...
it's really exactly what I need.

24:35.843 --> 24:36.777
- So...
- Okay.

24:40.147 --> 24:42.183
Big closet.

24:44.118 --> 24:45.286
Yep, you could fit
a lot in there.

24:45.319 --> 24:47.221
Yes, yes.

24:47.254 --> 24:50.257
So, uh, is there anything else
that you... that you might need?

24:50.291 --> 24:54.395
Uh, other than an 8 ball
and a good fisting,

24:54.428 --> 24:55.696
I think I'm good.

24:55.729 --> 24:57.665
I'm sorry, come again?

24:57.698 --> 24:59.233
I'm just fucking
with you, Greg.

24:59.266 --> 25:01.335
- Oh, right.
- I'm sorry.

25:01.368 --> 25:03.737
- No, no.
- Demented sense of humor.

25:03.771 --> 25:05.739
- Not at all.
- Freaks people out.

25:05.773 --> 25:06.941
No, it didn't really
freak me out.

25:06.974 --> 25:08.375
I was actually
pretty centered with it.

25:08.409 --> 25:09.844
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

25:09.877 --> 25:11.846
I've never been fisted.

25:11.879 --> 25:12.947
I've never done cocaine.

25:14.782 --> 25:17.885
Cool.

25:17.918 --> 25:19.086
This is nice.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.122
Right, so, um,
do you have any...

25:21.155 --> 25:22.957
uh, you have a box...

25:22.990 --> 25:25.860
do you have anything
in your car, or boxes or...?

25:25.893 --> 25:27.661
Yeah, but I'll just...
I'll deal with it later.

25:27.695 --> 25:29.063
- Yeah, okay. All right.
- Yeah.

25:29.096 --> 25:32.199
Well, um, let me know
if you need any help,

25:32.233 --> 25:34.668
uh, loading it...
loading it in.

25:34.702 --> 25:36.370
- Aw, thanks. Thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

25:36.403 --> 25:38.706
Uh, the door... these o...
these doors open.

25:38.739 --> 25:40.841
And, uh, <i>mahalo.</i>

25:40.875 --> 25:42.276
Yeah.

25:42.309 --> 25:45.045
Oh, this... actually this, um...
this is a painting

25:45.079 --> 25:47.314
that was done
by my grandfather.

25:47.348 --> 25:49.416
- He served in World War II.
- Oh.

25:49.450 --> 25:54.121
And he was also a really huge
aficionado of Hungarian art.

25:54.155 --> 25:57.158
- And, um...
- Hungarian art?

25:57.191 --> 25:58.926
Yeah, and this
is actually Budapest.

25:58.959 --> 26:01.395
And, um, he fell in love
with... with Hungary.

26:01.428 --> 26:05.332
- But this is Florence.
- This is Budapest, actually.

26:05.366 --> 26:07.835
- But it says Florence.
- He would tell the stories...

26:07.868 --> 26:09.436
No, this is the name
of the painting.

26:09.470 --> 26:12.806
It's Firenze.
It's actually "fire."

26:12.840 --> 26:14.275
It means "fire" in Hungarian.

26:14.308 --> 26:17.344
"Firenze" means "Florence"
in Italian.

26:17.378 --> 26:21.482
And I lived over here
in Florence.

26:21.515 --> 26:25.786
This is the Duomo.
This is the Arno.

26:25.819 --> 26:28.422
It's definitely Budapest.

26:28.455 --> 26:30.824
And this is actually
the Budapest river.

26:30.858 --> 26:32.826
Okay.

26:32.860 --> 26:36.030
Yeah.

26:36.063 --> 26:38.999
Fist bump. What?

26:39.033 --> 26:40.234
Now you've been fisted.

26:43.003 --> 26:46.273
<i>Holy cow. Am I right?</i>

26:46.307 --> 26:48.209
<i>Greg not only
found a roommate,</i>

26:48.242 --> 26:50.244
<i>but he might have just
manifested</i>

26:50.277 --> 26:52.813
<i>the real girl of his dreams.</i>

26:52.846 --> 26:56.917
<i>Of all the girls
he has fallen way too hard for,</i>

26:56.951 --> 26:59.286
<i>he has never experienced
love at first sight</i>

26:59.320 --> 27:01.188
<i>quite like this.</i>

27:01.222 --> 27:03.757
<i>He was sure Paul
would be happy for him.</i>

27:07.161 --> 27:08.896
So, uh, I got a new roommate.

27:08.929 --> 27:11.065
Mm.

27:11.098 --> 27:12.466
- You did?
- Yeah.

27:12.499 --> 27:14.802
I have to say,
I think I'm in love.

27:16.503 --> 27:17.938
Listen, Greg.

27:17.972 --> 27:19.240
Oh, fuck.

27:19.273 --> 27:21.875
I get that you're angry
at women, okay?

27:21.909 --> 27:23.477
Understandably so.

27:23.510 --> 27:27.214
I mean, Ash completely
steamrolled over your nuts.

27:27.248 --> 27:30.084
Like totally obliviated
any trace of manhood

27:30.117 --> 27:31.552
- that you once had.
- Paul, I got it.

27:31.585 --> 27:34.321
She pretty much ripped your dick
in half and stuck it

27:34.355 --> 27:37.424
- in between your legs.
- Paul! I got it.

27:37.458 --> 27:39.326
- But switching teams, Greg?
- No!

27:39.360 --> 27:41.095
Come on, man.
That's a little dramatic.

27:41.128 --> 27:43.163
I mean, I... I'm okay with it.
I'm okay with it.

27:43.197 --> 27:46.166
You know, I guess.
Change and everything. Huh.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.501
It's a girl.

27:47.534 --> 27:50.971
A disarmingly cute
and attractive girl.

27:51.005 --> 27:52.039
Fuck!

27:52.072 --> 27:54.174
Fucking son of a bitch!

27:54.208 --> 27:56.910
Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck, Greg!

27:56.944 --> 28:01.582
Come on, man.
Come the fuck on!

28:01.616 --> 28:04.184
- Jesus.
- Fuck!

28:04.218 --> 28:06.387
I'm sorry.

28:06.420 --> 28:07.821
I'm sorry, Greg.

28:07.855 --> 28:08.989
That was a little bit
uncalled for.

28:09.023 --> 28:10.324
I understand that.

28:10.357 --> 28:11.525
It's just that
you just fuckin'...

28:11.558 --> 28:13.494
you rile me up, man.
You just...

28:13.527 --> 28:15.362
You rile me up
like no other.

28:15.396 --> 28:17.398
God.

28:17.431 --> 28:18.966
I can see that.

28:18.999 --> 28:20.501
What did I tell you
about a girl roommate?

28:20.534 --> 28:22.403
Well, I didn't know
it was a girl.

28:22.436 --> 28:24.505
What the fuck
does that even mean?

28:24.538 --> 28:26.307
Her name was Peyton.

28:26.340 --> 28:28.509
Oh.
Like Peyton Manning?

28:28.542 --> 28:31.211
Yes! Therefore I thought
it was a dude.

28:31.245 --> 28:33.347
Yeah.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.481
Yeah.

28:34.515 --> 28:36.216
Yeah,
I can understand that.

28:36.250 --> 28:37.951
I can see that. I woulda thought
the same thing, actually,

28:37.985 --> 28:39.520
Yeah.

28:39.553 --> 28:41.355
Come on, man.
You're smarter than this.

28:41.388 --> 28:42.489
Look at what happened
with Ash.

28:42.523 --> 28:44.191
Oh, God.
Enough with Ashley, okay?

28:44.224 --> 28:46.960
Her and Dr. Wilbon and I,

28:46.994 --> 28:51.332
we had a very mature,
adult conversation.

28:51.365 --> 28:52.533
We talked everything out.

28:52.566 --> 28:54.968
We achieved
some very nice closure.

28:56.337 --> 28:59.473
Wh... what are
you doing, Greg?

28:59.506 --> 29:01.942
I'm getting closure!

29:06.447 --> 29:08.349
How you like them apples,
motherfucker?

29:08.382 --> 29:12.353
A-are you serious?
Come on.

29:12.386 --> 29:14.054
That's actually pretty good.

29:14.088 --> 29:15.255
What brand is it?

29:15.289 --> 29:16.624
All right, are we
done here now?

29:16.658 --> 29:19.093
No!

29:19.126 --> 29:22.262
Anything breakable here?

29:22.296 --> 29:23.997
Ah!

29:24.031 --> 29:26.500
Greg, no, Greg.
Come on, don't.

29:26.533 --> 29:28.302
No! Don't!
Greg!

29:35.342 --> 29:39.279
Those are the remains
of a human being.

29:39.313 --> 29:42.082
Aren't they?

29:42.116 --> 29:44.585
Two, actually.

29:44.619 --> 29:46.253
My mother and my father.

29:49.089 --> 29:50.591
Really?

29:50.625 --> 29:52.292
Yeah.

29:52.326 --> 29:53.628
Then I am very impressed,
Greg.

29:53.661 --> 29:56.296
Thank you.

29:56.330 --> 29:58.365
And Peyton is great.

29:58.399 --> 30:00.934
She's really fucking great.

30:00.968 --> 30:02.704
It was like love at first sight,
I'm telling you.

30:02.737 --> 30:04.706
Aw, come on
with that bullshit.

30:04.739 --> 30:07.174
That never happens.
It's just a rebound, Greg.

30:07.207 --> 30:09.042
It's probably the first girl
that you've seen

30:09.076 --> 30:10.645
in, like, over a month.

30:10.678 --> 30:12.413
Of course you're gonna think
you're in love with her.

30:12.446 --> 30:14.314
Are you stupid or something?

30:14.348 --> 30:16.450
Listen, this is what you do.

30:16.483 --> 30:18.152
You take her out to Indian food.

30:18.185 --> 30:21.355
You get her the curry,
you get her the roti, the works.

30:21.388 --> 30:23.457
You put a little laxative
in her drink

30:23.490 --> 30:25.392
when she goes to the bathroom.

30:25.426 --> 30:29.530
Then you go to one of those
new escape room things.

30:29.563 --> 30:32.266
Boom, that'll set you
fucking straight

30:32.299 --> 30:33.735
with this
"in love" bullshit.

30:35.369 --> 30:37.605
I don't know.

30:37.639 --> 30:38.740
Maybe you're right.

30:38.773 --> 30:40.040
'Course I'm right.

30:40.073 --> 30:41.308
Now don't just sit there.

30:41.341 --> 30:44.612
Toss me one of those brewskis,
will ya?

30:44.646 --> 30:46.980
Come into my domicile,
two twelve packs of beers,

30:47.014 --> 30:48.382
you don't even
offer me one.

30:48.415 --> 30:50.117
What are you,
a fucking savage or something?

30:50.150 --> 30:52.286
You shook it up.
Come on, put it back, Greg.

30:54.455 --> 30:55.690
Get me a good one.

31:04.632 --> 31:06.567
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, hey.

31:06.601 --> 31:09.336
Oh, no worries.
Just getting my yoga on.

31:09.369 --> 31:11.305
It's not like I'm doing
naked yoga or anything.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.374
Would you?

31:14.408 --> 31:15.476
Oh, have you ever
tried this shit?

31:15.509 --> 31:16.577
It's a total trip.

31:16.611 --> 31:18.278
Uh, you know, no.

31:18.312 --> 31:22.684
I... I'm not...
I'm not a big yoga... yoga-er.

31:22.717 --> 31:24.117
You should try it sometime.

31:24.151 --> 31:26.587
Releases
a lot of endorphins.

31:26.621 --> 31:29.624
I'll probably pass
because back in high school

31:29.657 --> 31:31.291
there was this guy named
Jimmy Knox,

31:31.325 --> 31:33.728
and after gym class
he would bend me over,

31:33.761 --> 31:37.364
but backwards
and then forwards,

31:37.397 --> 31:39.199
and he broke my rib.

31:39.233 --> 31:41.703
And he said, "I bet now
that you have a broken rib,

31:41.736 --> 31:43.370
you can suck your own dick."

31:43.403 --> 31:45.572
Oh, my God.
What a jerk.

31:45.607 --> 31:46.608
I know.

31:46.641 --> 31:48.075
C-could you do it?

31:48.108 --> 31:49.711
Actually, yeah.

31:49.744 --> 31:51.044
I mean,
not that I ever did.

31:51.078 --> 31:52.579
No, no.
Of course not.

31:55.215 --> 31:57.819
Fuck me.

31:57.852 --> 32:00.320
What... what'd you say?

32:00.354 --> 32:05.392
Um, I said,
"My God, this is a good day."

32:05.425 --> 32:08.061
Hmm, I don't think
I'm gonna do anymore yoga.

32:08.095 --> 32:09.263
Do you want a smoothie?

32:09.296 --> 32:12.165
Yes, I would love one.

32:12.199 --> 32:14.669
Wow, this looks
super healthy.

32:14.702 --> 32:16.203
Yeah, I know, right?

32:16.236 --> 32:17.204
I don't know
if my Midwest body's

32:17.237 --> 32:18.606
gonna be able to handle it.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.308
Might have a shit-right-
through-my-yoga-pants

32:21.341 --> 32:22.777
situation on my hands.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.746
Yeah, I know exactly
what you are talking about.

32:24.779 --> 32:26.648
I have a shit-through-my-pants
situation

32:26.681 --> 32:28.081
with about everything I eat.

32:28.115 --> 32:29.349
Oh.

32:29.383 --> 32:30.685
Yeah.

32:30.718 --> 32:33.287
I have a leaky stomach.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.354
I'm sorry to hear that.

32:36.523 --> 32:38.091
Yeah.

32:38.125 --> 32:39.326
So, where'd you say
you were from again?

32:39.359 --> 32:41.562
- Chi-town?
- Ah, makes sense.

32:41.595 --> 32:43.397
Why do you say that?

32:43.430 --> 32:46.734
You're just so open
and generous.

32:46.768 --> 32:49.570
That's really sweet.

32:49.604 --> 32:53.708
Thanks. Um, yeah, my friends
back home are pretty awesome.

32:53.741 --> 32:55.409
So, what brought you, uh...

32:55.442 --> 32:56.611
what brought you
all the way out here?

32:56.644 --> 32:58.312
The porn industry.

33:00.447 --> 33:01.883
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:01.916 --> 33:03.818
- I want to get into porn.
- Oh.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.552
I tried the whole
nine-to-five thing

33:05.586 --> 33:07.220
and it's just...
it's not for me.

33:07.254 --> 33:08.756
- Right.
- Plus, there's loads

33:08.790 --> 33:10.692
- of money in it.
- Right.

33:10.725 --> 33:12.760
Like, loads.

33:12.794 --> 33:13.895
Right.

33:13.928 --> 33:15.395
Do you like porn, Greg?

33:17.665 --> 33:18.833
You know...

33:21.268 --> 33:22.604
...that's
an interesting question.

33:22.637 --> 33:25.807
Um, you know, there's...
I'm quite...

33:25.840 --> 33:28.408
there's a... I have...

33:28.442 --> 33:29.844
You know, my mom always
used to say

33:29.877 --> 33:33.681
that when I choose
to express myself,

33:33.715 --> 33:35.717
uh, in an intimate way,

33:35.750 --> 33:40.387
uh, objectifying women
is not something that...

33:40.420 --> 33:43.223
Uh, my...
I-I've heard of it.

33:45.760 --> 33:50.430
- You've heard of it?
- Yeah.

33:50.464 --> 33:52.265
Oh, my God, dude,
I'm fucking with you.

33:52.299 --> 33:54.434
- Really
- Yes.

33:54.468 --> 33:56.503
Oh, Jesus, well,
I didn't know what to say.

33:56.536 --> 33:58.673
- Oh, my God.
- So, wait, are you in...

33:58.706 --> 34:02.309
No, I'm going to UCLA grad
school for journalism next week.

34:02.342 --> 34:03.443
Completely different answer
from the first.

34:03.477 --> 34:05.345
- Totally different.
- Yeah.

34:05.379 --> 34:07.682
Yeah, I've always been
interested in telling stories

34:07.715 --> 34:10.752
grounded in truth,
so journalism,

34:10.784 --> 34:12.518
and I figure
if that doesn't work out,

34:12.552 --> 34:13.855
then I can just transition

34:13.888 --> 34:16.690
into documentary filmmaking,
you know.

34:16.724 --> 34:19.559
- Yeah, anything.
- Or porn. You know?

34:19.592 --> 34:22.429
Always got porn
as a fall back.

34:22.462 --> 34:23.697
That's what my mother said.

34:26.801 --> 34:30.270
She did.
Okay, so, let's give it a whirl.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.250
I want to make sure
it's really smooth.

34:43.283 --> 34:45.217
They don't call it
a chunky.

34:47.254 --> 34:49.556
I'm going
for a smooth move smoothie.

34:51.425 --> 34:52.492
That's so cute.

34:53.928 --> 34:55.395
All right,
I think we're done.

34:57.497 --> 34:59.934
All right.
Here goes nothin'.

35:03.570 --> 35:06.841
Okay, to juice cleanses,
pornos,

35:06.874 --> 35:08.676
and our rapidly approaching

35:08.710 --> 35:11.244
and inevitably powerful
bowel movements.

35:11.278 --> 35:12.714
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

35:17.451 --> 35:18.786
Hmm, it's not bad.

35:18.820 --> 35:21.923
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, it's good.

35:21.956 --> 35:25.292
Okay, well, I have
an alarmingly significant

35:25.325 --> 35:26.928
amount of swamp ass
happening in my pants right now,

35:26.961 --> 35:28.863
so I'm gonna get
out of my sweaty clothes

35:28.896 --> 35:30.397
and into the shower.

35:30.430 --> 35:31.866
Yeah, okay, sounds good.

35:41.976 --> 35:43.276
Greg, what in heavens
are you doing here?

35:43.310 --> 35:44.779
Emergency sesh, Doc.

35:44.812 --> 35:46.614
- Now, just wait a minute.
- Emergency sesh, STAT.

35:48.582 --> 35:50.718
Wenona?

35:50.752 --> 35:52.920
Oh, um, hey, Greg.

35:52.954 --> 35:55.422
Fancy seeing you here.

35:55.455 --> 35:57.290
You never called me back.

35:57.324 --> 35:58.960
What is wrong with you?

35:58.993 --> 36:01.028
Are you afraid
of a little adventure?

36:02.663 --> 36:05.867
Look, I got your nose.
Let's be friends.

36:05.900 --> 36:08.936
Great sesh, Dr. Naik.
Same time next week?

36:08.970 --> 36:11.571
Yes, yes.
That works splendidly.

36:11.606 --> 36:14.776
Ta-ta, boys.
Behave.

36:14.809 --> 36:15.943
Oh.

36:18.679 --> 36:19.947
Are you fucking her?

36:19.981 --> 36:22.349
Of course not.
She's just a client.

36:22.382 --> 36:23.583
You know what?
You doctors just can't

36:23.618 --> 36:26.087
keep it in your pants,
can you?

36:26.120 --> 36:27.688
Moving right along.

36:27.722 --> 36:29.824
Enough about me.
Let's focus on you.

36:31.358 --> 36:34.294
So, what's this
emergency you have?

36:35.830 --> 36:37.397
I'm in love.

36:37.430 --> 36:38.900
It's my roommate.

36:38.933 --> 36:40.768
She lives in my apartment
and I'm in love with her

36:40.802 --> 36:43.336
and I've barely even seen her
or spoken to her.

36:43.370 --> 36:44.972
It's like...

36:45.006 --> 36:46.540
She can't be real.

36:46.573 --> 36:48.475
It's like she's
too good to be true.

36:48.508 --> 36:49.977
What the hell do I do?

36:50.011 --> 36:52.780
This is what I suggest, Greg.

36:52.814 --> 36:55.082
Life is short.

36:55.116 --> 36:57.952
The wise and doctor
thing for me to do

36:57.985 --> 37:02.056
is to advise you to forget
about her completely.

37:03.791 --> 37:05.760
Admit that you have
a love addition problem

37:05.793 --> 37:08.062
that needs immediate attention

37:08.095 --> 37:10.097
and aggressive
rehabilitation.

37:10.131 --> 37:13.801
Well, I say, if you really
like this girl, go for it,

37:13.835 --> 37:15.402
because, fuck it.

37:15.435 --> 37:18.538
What's the worst
that could possibly happen?

37:18.572 --> 37:22.043
She turns you down.
Big fucking whoop, Gregory.

37:22.076 --> 37:25.680
Her turning you down
doesn't hold a candle

37:25.713 --> 37:28.983
to your ex-girlfriend
fucking your couples therapist.

37:29.016 --> 37:31.518
Wow.

37:31.551 --> 37:32.920
That's very honest.

37:32.954 --> 37:34.789
Go for it, Greg,
because if you don't,

37:34.822 --> 37:37.758
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

37:37.792 --> 37:40.460
Okay.

37:40.493 --> 37:43.631
Okay. Yeah.

37:43.664 --> 37:45.900
I can do this.

37:45.933 --> 37:47.768
I think I can.

37:47.802 --> 37:50.104
And I think this is exactly
what I needed to hear.

37:50.137 --> 37:52.106
More or less.

37:52.139 --> 37:53.641
Thank you.

37:53.674 --> 37:57.510
Yeah, I mean,
let's do this.

37:57.544 --> 37:59.479
Right?

38:01.749 --> 38:03.516
So, do you think
I should just go for it?

38:03.550 --> 38:04.919
I personally
think it's great.

38:04.952 --> 38:06.687
- Yeah? You think?
- Yes.

38:06.721 --> 38:08.055
That's why I was trying
to set you up

38:08.089 --> 38:09.757
with Wenona
in the first place,

38:09.790 --> 38:11.859
because you need to finally
move on from Ashley.

38:11.893 --> 38:14.128
Whom, by the way,
is sleeping with Dr. Naik.

38:14.161 --> 38:15.796
Jesus, really?

38:15.830 --> 38:17.464
How many therapists
is that chick gonna take down?

38:17.497 --> 38:19.066
No, not Ashley.
Wenona.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.035
Oh, well, makes sense.

38:21.068 --> 38:22.870
So, what should I do?

38:22.904 --> 38:25.139
I've never really tried
to pick up a roommate before.

38:25.172 --> 38:26.741
You know,
come to think of it,

38:26.774 --> 38:27.942
the only two people
I've ever tried to swoon

38:27.975 --> 38:28.976
were Lauren and Ashley.

38:29.010 --> 38:30.077
Are those the only two people

38:30.111 --> 38:31.511
you've ever had sex with?

38:31.544 --> 38:32.613
No.

38:32.647 --> 38:34.682
Almost.
I mean, think about it.

38:34.715 --> 38:36.851
I was with Lauren
for seven years.

38:36.884 --> 38:38.551
I was with Ashley for five.

38:38.585 --> 38:42.455
God, that sounds
so depressing.

38:42.489 --> 38:44.792
Thanks, Jules, thanks.

38:44.825 --> 38:45.960
What should my angle be?

38:45.993 --> 38:47.728
I don't know what that means.

38:47.762 --> 38:49.897
My angle, my game plan,
my approach.

38:49.931 --> 38:51.999
How do I get Peyton
to fall madly in love with me?

38:52.033 --> 38:54.467
- Like, ASAP?
- All right, let me think.

39:00.274 --> 39:01.709
No, I don't have anything.

39:01.742 --> 39:03.844
Really? Nothing?

39:03.878 --> 39:07.480
Yeah, I... I never really
had a problem getting guys.

39:07.514 --> 39:08.983
It was just never
an issue for me.

39:09.016 --> 39:12.153
That's 'cause you're a girl.

39:12.186 --> 39:14.221
Maybe I should talk
to Paul about this.

39:14.255 --> 39:18.626
Hey, maybe you just need
to start being yourself.

39:18.659 --> 39:21.629
Yeah, really?

39:21.662 --> 39:22.797
You think
that would really work?

39:22.830 --> 39:24.497
Totally.

39:24.531 --> 39:26.033
You don't think that's
a disastrous plan

39:26.067 --> 39:27.702
that would just blow up
in my face?

39:27.735 --> 39:29.236
Mm-mm.

39:29.270 --> 39:30.938
It'd be good.

39:33.007 --> 39:35.977
I mean, all right.
I might... I can do that.

39:36.010 --> 39:38.279
Yeah, yeah, you can do that.

39:38.312 --> 39:39.981
You get out there
and do it, kid,

39:40.014 --> 39:42.116
because you are the...

39:42.149 --> 39:43.884
Gregorino, welcome back!

39:43.918 --> 39:46.287
You look like $100,000!

39:46.320 --> 39:48.022
Man, you are aces,

39:48.055 --> 39:49.824
and I love you
in this home, man.

39:49.857 --> 39:52.059
Let us just
have fun together.

39:52.093 --> 39:54.829
Huh?

39:54.862 --> 39:56.063
I gotta go.

39:56.097 --> 39:57.732
Yah!

40:19.120 --> 40:20.587
Okay.

40:20.621 --> 40:21.889
Mm, what are you cooking?

40:21.922 --> 40:23.290
That smells delicious.

40:23.324 --> 40:25.726
Oh, it's just a little...
little dish I whipped up

40:25.760 --> 40:27.294
on the fly, little
spur-of-the-moment thing.

40:27.328 --> 40:28.963
No big deal.

40:28.996 --> 40:30.597
Wow, I never knew you cooked.

40:30.631 --> 40:33.667
Yeah, I do lots
of really awesome stuff.

40:33.701 --> 40:34.769
Oh, uh, you know what?

40:34.802 --> 40:36.170
I actually made
enough for two,

40:36.203 --> 40:39.640
and I got some wine, too.

40:39.673 --> 40:40.975
That sounds awesome,

40:41.008 --> 40:42.943
but Jack and I are
going to dinner.

40:42.977 --> 40:45.846
Yeah, bro. We're hitting
up Bestia. You ever been?

40:45.880 --> 40:47.081
It's actually the hardest
reservation in town to get,

40:47.114 --> 40:48.349
but I just dropped
a name or two

40:48.382 --> 40:51.185
from my rolodex-o and...

40:51.218 --> 40:52.253
Yeah, voila!

40:52.286 --> 40:53.754
A table magically opened up.

40:53.788 --> 40:54.822
Well, it wasn't
really magic,

40:54.855 --> 40:56.657
I-I basically did that!

40:56.690 --> 40:58.859
8:00 p.m. reservation,
right up front,

40:58.893 --> 41:02.196
day of, no less.
Nonetheless.

41:02.229 --> 41:03.596
Wow.

41:03.631 --> 41:07.201
That's...
really impressive.

41:07.234 --> 41:09.370
Yeah, I know.
We were gonna Uber Select,

41:09.403 --> 41:12.273
but, uh, I figured I'd take
my new Tezzy for a spin.

41:12.306 --> 41:16.110
All right, wow.
That sounds... mm.

41:16.143 --> 41:17.244
Do you want...
do you want to come with us?

41:19.713 --> 41:20.815
No, I... it's totally cool.

41:20.848 --> 41:25.152
I... I have... I made dinner.

41:25.186 --> 41:27.254
Just a little thing.
It's called bÃºn thit xÃ o.

41:27.288 --> 41:29.256
It's a Vietnamese
pork shoulder

41:29.290 --> 41:32.827
over vermicelli noodles
with a supple demi-glaze.

41:32.860 --> 41:35.029
- Wow.
- So good.

41:35.062 --> 41:36.163
Okay.

41:36.197 --> 41:38.265
That sounds really good.

41:38.299 --> 41:40.668
I have a knack
for Southeast Asian cuisine.

41:40.701 --> 41:43.137
Okay.

41:43.170 --> 41:45.272
So, yeah,
I'm gonna make dinner

41:45.306 --> 41:47.241
and maybe get
into some boxed wine

41:47.274 --> 41:49.677
and watch some Kardashians.

41:49.710 --> 41:51.112
That sounds fun.

41:51.145 --> 41:53.414
Wow, livin' the dream.

41:53.447 --> 41:56.350
All right, well,
enjoy dinner.

41:56.383 --> 41:59.053
I'll... I'll see you later.

41:59.086 --> 42:00.087
I'll see you when I get home.

42:00.121 --> 42:01.288
- Okay.
- 'Kay.

42:01.322 --> 42:03.257
Enjoy those Kardashians, bro.

42:03.290 --> 42:04.792
Thanks, man.

42:04.825 --> 42:07.094
- Is he gay?
- I don't know. Shh.

42:07.128 --> 42:08.762
- I don't know.
- He's a tremendously good cook

42:08.796 --> 42:10.898
and he, like, watches
the E exclamation channel.

42:19.940 --> 42:21.342
<i>And just like that,</i>

42:21.375 --> 42:23.711
<i>Greg's life sucked ass
once again.</i>

42:23.744 --> 42:26.113
<i>He couldn't believe
his bad luck.</i>

42:26.147 --> 42:28.282
<i>All he wanted to do
was run after</i>

42:28.315 --> 42:32.319
<i>that Tezzy driving sack of shit
with his bÃºn thit xÃ o knife</i>

42:32.353 --> 42:34.121
<i>and stab him to death
with it</i>

42:34.155 --> 42:36.257
<i>so that he could be
with Peyton.</i>

42:36.290 --> 42:38.425
<i>But he decided to let
cooler heads prevail</i>

42:38.459 --> 42:40.895
<i>and go see Paul instead.</i>

42:45.065 --> 42:47.334
<i>Dude, you just got to nut up.</i>

42:47.368 --> 42:52.173
Every girl has got
Greggy-poo's head spinning.

42:52.206 --> 42:54.175
What are you
talking about? No, they don't.

42:54.208 --> 42:57.278
Uh, in high school,
there was that chick

42:57.311 --> 43:00.848
with the one hand who had
the different sized titties.

43:00.881 --> 43:02.383
What, you're talking
about Debra?

43:02.416 --> 43:04.351
No, no, she did not
have my head spinning.

43:04.385 --> 43:06.720
Agree to disagree, Greg.

43:06.754 --> 43:09.056
- Treat?
- Yeah.

43:09.089 --> 43:12.193
Mm.

43:12.226 --> 43:14.028
What about Lauren?

43:14.061 --> 43:15.996
Oh, come on, Lauren didn't
have my head spinning.

43:16.030 --> 43:19.366
You had to take a six-month
leave of absence from work

43:19.400 --> 43:21.402
for severe depression and
anxiety

43:21.435 --> 43:23.103
when she dumped you.

43:23.137 --> 43:26.006
Yeah, well, it was just
a phase I was going through.

43:27.541 --> 43:29.977
What about the rest of those
girls you obsessed about

43:30.010 --> 43:31.512
after they rejected you

43:31.545 --> 43:34.315
before you finally landed Ash,
that fuckin' winner?

43:34.348 --> 43:37.117
You know what? I did not
obsess over all those girls.

43:37.151 --> 43:40.754
Bro, three out of four of them
defriended you on Facebook.

43:40.788 --> 43:42.189
I was gonna defriend them first.

43:42.223 --> 43:44.058
They just... they beat me
to the punch.

43:44.091 --> 43:47.895
All I'm saying
is be careful, Greg.

43:47.928 --> 43:50.164
Look, I am, okay?
I get it.

43:50.197 --> 43:52.499
Paul, man.
Great hang today, huh, brother?

43:52.533 --> 43:54.435
Mm!

44:05.179 --> 44:06.480
Who's that?

44:06.513 --> 44:08.015
Fuck do I know?

44:23.564 --> 44:24.865
Hi, oh, I'm sorry.

44:24.898 --> 44:26.533
- I...
- Oh. Oh.

44:26.567 --> 44:28.235
I thought I was
the only one here.

44:28.269 --> 44:30.104
No, it's okay.

44:30.137 --> 44:31.205
I'll leave.

44:31.238 --> 44:33.240
No, no, no, no.
Would you stay?

44:34.942 --> 44:36.510
I'd like it if you'd stay.

44:36.543 --> 44:38.112
Okay.

44:45.052 --> 44:46.186
I'm not gonna bite you.

44:52.192 --> 44:54.461
Is everything all right?

44:54.495 --> 44:56.230
Yeah, I'm fine.

44:56.263 --> 44:58.198
How was dinner?

44:58.232 --> 45:00.301
Awful.

45:00.334 --> 45:02.336
I'm sorry to hear that.

45:02.369 --> 45:03.837
Guy was a fucking taint.

45:03.871 --> 45:05.239
Yeah, well,
he didn't really make

45:05.272 --> 45:07.141
the greatest
first impression.

45:07.174 --> 45:09.209
All he wanted to do
was have sex with me.

45:09.243 --> 45:12.379
I'm sorry, Peyton.

45:12.413 --> 45:15.316
Why are all guys
such slimy dick holes?

45:15.349 --> 45:17.851
Well, not all guys
are slimy dick holes.

45:17.885 --> 45:20.421
Some are really,
really, really great.

45:20.454 --> 45:21.922
All he did was talk
about himself

45:21.955 --> 45:23.424
and how much money he has,

45:23.457 --> 45:25.859
and blah-dee-fuckity-
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah,

45:25.893 --> 45:27.461
and then when I didn't
invite him in,

45:27.494 --> 45:30.632
he called me a prude bitch
and he drove away in his Tezzy.

45:30.665 --> 45:33.367
Tezzy? Really?
Fucking douchebag.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.869
What a clit face.

45:35.903 --> 45:37.538
Mm.

45:39.373 --> 45:41.643
What about you, Greg,
are you in a relationship?

45:41.676 --> 45:44.646
No, I am totally single.

45:44.679 --> 45:46.380
Completely available.

45:46.413 --> 45:48.349
Good.

45:48.382 --> 45:50.517
'Cause relationships suck.

45:50.551 --> 45:52.286
My last relationship,

45:52.319 --> 45:55.289
we lived together
for three years,

45:55.322 --> 45:58.192
and then I find out
that my best friend

45:58.225 --> 46:03.130
has been fucking him
for two of the three years.

46:03.163 --> 46:04.398
And how do I find out?

46:04.431 --> 46:06.033
I find out because
they asked me

46:06.066 --> 46:08.035
if I wanted to be
in a threesome with them.

46:08.068 --> 46:11.271
- Oh, my God.
- I know!

46:11.305 --> 46:13.608
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

46:13.641 --> 46:14.908
I am so sorry.

46:14.942 --> 46:16.410
I know exactly
how that feels.

46:16.443 --> 46:17.612
No, you do?

46:17.645 --> 46:19.647
It's so fucked up.

46:19.681 --> 46:21.382
By both of them.

46:21.415 --> 46:26.220
I found out
a month before I came out here.

46:26.253 --> 46:28.522
It's actually
what made me pull the trigger.

46:28.555 --> 46:31.058
Well, I mean, as awful
a situation as that is,

46:31.091 --> 46:34.094
I... I'm really sorry
that happened to you.

46:34.128 --> 46:38.031
You know, at least it
convinced you to come out here.

46:40.501 --> 46:42.604
Yeah.

46:42.637 --> 46:46.373
Hey, would it be, um,
totally inappropriate

46:46.407 --> 46:48.375
- if we spooned?
- Fuck, no.

46:48.409 --> 46:51.345
Okay.

46:51.378 --> 46:52.579
I want to be
the little one.

46:52.614 --> 46:53.681
I'd like to do it
right now.

46:53.715 --> 46:54.649
Me, too.

46:56.016 --> 46:58.485
Ooh.
Ooh-kay.

46:58.519 --> 47:00.622
Ooh-kay.

47:00.655 --> 47:02.189
Yeah.

47:02.222 --> 47:05.727
Yeah, that's
a tad overzealous.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.327
It feels right to me.

47:07.361 --> 47:09.697
Mm, I'm actually having
trouble breathing.

47:09.731 --> 47:12.399
There we go, okay.

47:17.304 --> 47:18.539
That's good.

47:22.476 --> 47:25.045
Good night, Greg.

47:26.513 --> 47:28.015
Good night, Peyton.

47:40.027 --> 47:41.428
I can feel your dick.

48:29.677 --> 48:31.646
Come in.

48:36.718 --> 48:39.152
Well, would you look at this.

48:39.186 --> 48:43.190
The man was paralyzed
with anxiety and depression,

48:43.223 --> 48:47.261
and now he's transformed himself
into a whistling Dixie

48:47.294 --> 48:49.496
right before our very eyes.

48:49.530 --> 48:50.832
Morning, Doc.

48:50.865 --> 48:52.232
You got some ass, didn't you?

48:52.266 --> 48:55.402
Nope, even better.
Cuddling.

48:55.435 --> 48:56.604
Cuddling?

48:56.638 --> 48:59.072
Yeah.
Total cuddle sesh.

48:59.106 --> 49:01.743
- Cuddle sesh with whom?
- My roommate.

49:01.776 --> 49:04.578
Ah, yes.
The roommate.

49:04.612 --> 49:07.749
Oh, wow.
Good for you, sailor.

49:07.782 --> 49:09.249
Give it a few more months

49:09.283 --> 49:11.585
and maybe you can
grab a tit or two.

49:11.619 --> 49:13.788
That's the thing, I don't even
care about the sexual part.

49:13.821 --> 49:15.489
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:15.522 --> 49:17.357
I mean, look, of course,
she's smoking hot,

49:17.391 --> 49:19.259
so getting
a nice blowy or two from her

49:19.293 --> 49:21.863
or making some sweet love
would certainly be nice.

49:21.896 --> 49:24.632
What about in the bum?

49:24.666 --> 49:27.267
Am I actually paying you
for these sessions?

49:27.301 --> 49:29.403
Moving right along,
let's continue.

49:29.436 --> 49:31.271
No, that's the different
thing about her,

49:31.305 --> 49:33.106
is I don't care
about that part.

49:33.140 --> 49:37.812
It's like, I don't know,
I just wanna be...

49:37.845 --> 49:40.314
I don't know,
I just want to be near her.

49:40.347 --> 49:42.884
You know? It's like we have
this crazy soul connection.

49:42.917 --> 49:44.652
I don't know.
I can't describe it.

49:44.686 --> 49:46.386
Well, that's terrific, Greg.

49:46.420 --> 49:47.889
I'm very happy for you.

49:47.922 --> 49:49.356
Thanks, Doc.

49:49.389 --> 49:50.625
I feel like a new man.

49:50.658 --> 49:52.694
I must warn you, though.

49:52.727 --> 49:55.128
This could be
a natural high of sorts.

49:55.162 --> 49:57.899
Given with your love addiction
and all,

49:57.932 --> 50:01.368
sometimes the mind
creates a fictional experience,

50:01.401 --> 50:03.871
a false high,
similar to feelings

50:03.905 --> 50:06.841
of being lost and emptiness
during depression.

50:06.874 --> 50:08.610
I don't want you
to get too high

50:08.643 --> 50:11.913
and then crash and then take
a step backwards.

50:11.946 --> 50:15.783
You know, I...
I wouldn't worry.

50:15.817 --> 50:17.852
I think I've really
turned a corner here, Doc.

50:17.885 --> 50:19.486
But I have to say,

50:19.519 --> 50:21.221
those were some impressive
words of wisdom.

50:21.254 --> 50:22.824
You actually sound like
a real doctor.

50:22.857 --> 50:26.193
- Well, thanks, Greg.
- Yeah.

50:26.226 --> 50:28.428
You know what?
I'll catch you later.

50:28.462 --> 50:30.497
We have 55 minutes
left in our session.

50:30.530 --> 50:31.866
I don't think I need 'em.

50:31.899 --> 50:33.400
I feel great.

50:33.433 --> 50:34.802
Plus, I gotta
take a shit.

50:34.836 --> 50:37.170
See you later, Doc.

50:39.206 --> 50:41.876
Aw, shit.
What's up, my girl?

50:41.909 --> 50:44.746
<i>Well, you seem to be
in a better mood today.</i>

50:44.779 --> 50:46.614
Well, I am.
I think I'm starting to feel

50:46.648 --> 50:49.249
- like my old self again.
- <i>Oh, that's terrific.</i>

50:49.282 --> 50:51.653
<i>How's the new roommate?
Julie told me all about her.</i>

50:51.686 --> 50:54.488
Mom, she's amazing.
Like, I'm not kidding.

50:54.521 --> 50:56.590
I think she's like
relationship-worthy amazing.

50:56.624 --> 50:58.793
- <i>Oh, boy.</i>
- Oh, boy, what?

50:58.826 --> 51:00.494
<i>Just be careful
not to rush things.</i>

51:00.527 --> 51:02.229
<i>When something seems
too good to be true,</i>

51:02.262 --> 51:03.230
<i>it often is.</i>

51:03.263 --> 51:04.398
Why's everybody

51:04.431 --> 51:06.233
keep saying that to me?

51:06.266 --> 51:08.636
And I love your optimism,
by the way.

51:08.670 --> 51:11.338
- You sound just like Dad.
- <i>Well, I'm just saying.</i>

51:11.371 --> 51:12.774
<i>I don't want to see you
get hurt again.</i>

51:12.807 --> 51:14.341
Well, son of a sailor, Mom.

51:14.374 --> 51:16.309
Way to take the wind
right out of my sails.

51:16.343 --> 51:17.912
<i>Well, I don't mean to.</i>

51:17.945 --> 51:19.546
<i>I'm just trying to keep you
from getting hurt,</i>

51:19.579 --> 51:20.948
<i>to protect you, jeez.</i>

51:20.982 --> 51:22.349
Yeah, yeah.

51:22.382 --> 51:24.351
Greg!

51:24.384 --> 51:26.453
Mom, I gotta go. That's Jules.

51:26.486 --> 51:28.656
<i>Okay, say hi
to Jules for me.</i>

51:28.690 --> 51:29.724
I will.
And, hey, look.

51:29.757 --> 51:30.992
You are a dirty-ass sailor,

51:31.025 --> 51:32.559
but, God damn it,
I love you.

51:32.592 --> 51:36.296
<i>I love you, too, baby.
Bye-bye.</i>

51:38.532 --> 51:40.768
Hey, Jules, I'm in here.

51:40.802 --> 51:42.670
Oh, Jesus Christ, Greg.

51:42.704 --> 51:45.338
It smells like Grandpa
when he had his colonoscopy.

51:45.372 --> 51:46.941
Sorry.

51:46.974 --> 51:49.744
I had a pork shoulder
with vermicelli noodles

51:49.777 --> 51:51.511
with a supple demi-glaze
last night.

51:53.313 --> 51:54.782
Best TV dinner
I've ever had.

51:54.816 --> 51:57.985
Oh, man, that is
just rank, Greg.

51:58.019 --> 52:02.589
It's like a thick,
misty... just thick.

52:02.623 --> 52:03.958
It's just really thick.

52:03.991 --> 52:04.992
Oh, I'm sorry.

52:05.026 --> 52:07.260
Anyway, is she here?

52:07.294 --> 52:08.896
And are you sure
that you want to subject her

52:08.930 --> 52:11.331
to, you know, like,
our family bowel problems?

52:11.364 --> 52:12.900
No, of course not,
but she's not here.

52:12.934 --> 52:15.402
- She must be in class.
- Class?

52:15.435 --> 52:17.739
Please tell me
you're not robbing the cradle.

52:17.772 --> 52:20.507
Grad school, Jules.
Grad school.

52:20.540 --> 52:22.509
Thank God.
Phew.

52:24.011 --> 52:24.946
Who is that?

52:24.979 --> 52:26.814
I think it's for me.

52:26.848 --> 52:29.050
I'm gonna be back
in a second.

52:29.083 --> 52:31.819
Who is that?
Who the fuck is that?

52:31.853 --> 52:35.757
Shut the door!
Don't leave me like this!

52:35.790 --> 52:38.059
God damn it.

52:38.092 --> 52:39.894
Spell my name, boy.

52:39.927 --> 52:41.896
One!

52:41.929 --> 52:44.331
Spell my name out loud.

52:45.700 --> 52:47.534
Okay.

52:47.567 --> 52:49.003
H-E-C-T-O-R.

52:49.036 --> 52:51.873
That's right.
Do it again.

52:51.906 --> 52:53.573
H-E-C-T-O-R.

52:53.608 --> 52:55.076
That's right.
Do it again! Once more!

52:55.109 --> 52:56.476
Whoo!

52:56.510 --> 52:58.012
H-E-C-T-O-R.

52:58.045 --> 52:59.446
Yeah!

52:59.479 --> 53:00.480
Don't you forget,
motherfucker.

53:00.514 --> 53:02.884
- One more time.
- H-E-C-T-O-R.

53:02.917 --> 53:04.051
That's what
I'm talking about.

53:04.085 --> 53:05.920
H-E-C-T-O-R.

53:05.953 --> 53:07.922
H-E-C-T-O-R.

53:07.955 --> 53:10.825
H-E-C-T-O-R.

53:10.858 --> 53:12.492
Whoo!

53:13.895 --> 53:15.763
All right, baby girl.
Good to see you.

53:18.699 --> 53:20.333
Have you a good day.

53:20.367 --> 53:22.937
Mm, you, too, Hector.
I will see you tomorrow.

53:22.970 --> 53:23.971
Can't wait.

53:32.546 --> 53:33.748
All right.

53:36.449 --> 53:37.985
Great workout.

53:41.656 --> 53:43.991
Not bad, pussy boy.
Not bad at all.

53:44.025 --> 53:46.027
You might have a soldier
in there after all.

53:46.060 --> 53:48.863
- Thank you, sir.
- Spell my name.

53:48.896 --> 53:51.065
H-E-C-T-O-R.

53:51.098 --> 53:52.499
All right, then.

53:58.438 --> 54:01.609
See? Right? He's not so bad.

54:01.642 --> 54:03.711
What are you talking about?
He's a psycho.

54:03.744 --> 54:06.546
Oh, you're so dramatic.
And, you know what?

54:06.580 --> 54:08.616
If you stop being so
negative and keep it up,

54:08.649 --> 54:09.817
I think you have
a really good chance

54:09.851 --> 54:11.085
of getting back
on his squad.

54:11.118 --> 54:13.087
His squad?
What does that even mean?

54:13.120 --> 54:14.622
I don't know what it means,

54:14.655 --> 54:16.057
but I know you
want to be on it.

54:16.090 --> 54:17.892
All right, listen,
I gotta run.

54:17.925 --> 54:20.527
But, wait, I thought you had
to talk to me about something.

54:20.560 --> 54:22.063
Nope.
I was just trying to trick you

54:22.096 --> 54:23.764
into exercising,
which worked,

54:23.798 --> 54:24.932
so you could
get those endorphins.

54:24.966 --> 54:26.767
Oh, my God,
you are the worst!

54:26.801 --> 54:28.069
- Ow.
- Sorry.

54:28.102 --> 54:30.104
But I love you, Greg.

54:30.137 --> 54:31.138
So be good.

54:31.172 --> 54:32.740
I love you, too.

54:32.773 --> 54:35.009
Okay, well,
feel better.

54:35.042 --> 54:38.045
And stop
being crazy, okay?

54:38.079 --> 54:39.780
Okay.

54:39.814 --> 54:42.582
- Hey, Jules.
- Yeah?

54:42.617 --> 54:43.885
Thank you.

54:43.918 --> 54:45.485
You're welcome, girl.

55:25.492 --> 55:26.727
The first stop

55:26.761 --> 55:27.895
is the most important
stop of the day.

55:27.929 --> 55:29.630
Your mind is about
to be blown

55:29.664 --> 55:31.564
with delicious
gloriousness.

55:31.598 --> 55:34.168
Okay, so, um,
I'm a vegetarian.

55:37.204 --> 55:38.505
- Oh.
- Yeah.

55:38.538 --> 55:39.874
Yeah, Greg.

55:39.907 --> 55:41.541
Have you not seen any
of the documentaries

55:41.574 --> 55:43.110
about factory farming
and the treatment

55:43.144 --> 55:46.647
of animals
in the United States?

55:46.681 --> 55:49.582
- Uh, no.
- I mean, it's...

55:49.617 --> 55:52.485
it's not appetizing,
I'll say that.

55:52.519 --> 55:54.487
I mean, it's atrocious.

55:54.521 --> 55:56.157
Okay.

55:56.190 --> 55:57.925
Um, yeah.

55:57.959 --> 56:01.195
I think there's a vegan Indian
place down the road.

56:01.228 --> 56:03.164
- Vegan?
- Yeah.

56:03.197 --> 56:04.966
I'm just fucking with you, dude!

56:04.999 --> 56:06.934
I'm from Chicago,
of course I eat meat!

56:06.968 --> 56:10.104
Come on.
You are so gullible.

56:12.539 --> 56:15.508
Oh, my God.
I am so fucked.

56:40.101 --> 56:41.568
I'm fisting it.

56:41.602 --> 56:43.871
Uh, you can.

56:43.904 --> 56:45.706
Go for it!

56:45.740 --> 56:47.008
Whoo!

56:47.041 --> 56:49.844
So, yeah, here we are.

56:49.877 --> 56:51.112
This is Hollywood.

56:51.145 --> 56:52.545
That looks like a bonsai tree,

56:52.579 --> 56:54.148
- but a big one.
- Mm-hmm. It does.

56:54.181 --> 56:55.850
Like, the opposite
of a bonsai tree,

56:55.883 --> 56:58.753
but the type of tree
they make into bonsai plants?

56:58.786 --> 57:00.221
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:00.254 --> 57:01.554
Are you a botanist?

57:04.992 --> 57:06.193
- On your mark...
- Okay.

57:06.227 --> 57:08.229
...get set...

57:08.262 --> 57:10.197
go!

58:05.019 --> 58:08.289
Oh, my God.
This is amazing.

58:08.322 --> 58:10.958
No, you have
a real talent.

58:10.991 --> 58:12.893
It's nothing.
Really.

58:17.965 --> 58:20.134
But, thank you.
I will keep it in mind

58:20.167 --> 58:21.402
just in case the writing thing
doesn't work out.

58:25.706 --> 58:27.341
What is this?
This is really good.

58:27.374 --> 58:29.243
Mm.
Thank you.

58:29.276 --> 58:34.281
It's, um, a cabernet sauvignon
from the Franzia region.

58:34.315 --> 58:36.984
- Oh, Franzia region.
- Yes. Mm.

58:37.017 --> 58:39.954
- Near Napa.
- Napa, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

58:39.987 --> 58:41.355
Well, I like it.

58:41.388 --> 58:43.791
Yeah, me, too.

58:43.824 --> 58:45.693
Lot of tannins.

58:45.726 --> 58:48.162
So, um...
so, how's school going?

58:48.195 --> 58:49.697
Great, actually.

58:49.730 --> 58:51.065
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

58:51.098 --> 58:52.333
Yeah, the material's
super interesting,

58:52.366 --> 58:55.803
and my professors
are super smart.

58:55.836 --> 58:57.304
What about your classmates?

58:57.338 --> 58:58.772
- Super dorky.
- Oh, nice.

58:58.806 --> 59:01.342
No, they're...
they're good.

59:01.375 --> 59:02.910
It sounds like
you made the right choice.

59:05.079 --> 59:09.450
Yeah, I don't know.
I hope so.

59:09.483 --> 59:12.686
I'm pretty sure you did.

59:12.720 --> 59:14.188
Yeah?

59:15.990 --> 59:17.791
Yeah.

59:20.427 --> 59:22.129
To making the right choice.

59:22.163 --> 59:24.098
Cheers.

59:42.483 --> 59:44.151
I like how you decorated.

59:46.020 --> 59:48.389
Thanks.

59:48.422 --> 59:52.226
None of it's mine, but...

59:52.259 --> 59:53.827
the bookcase is mine.

59:56.130 --> 59:58.432
I like the bookcase.

59:58.465 --> 59:59.733
Thanks.

01:00:03.938 --> 01:00:06.407
We should, um...
we should take a weekend trip

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.409
to Franzia sometimes.

01:00:08.442 --> 01:00:09.510
Sometime.

01:00:09.543 --> 01:00:11.779
- Franzia.
- Franzia.

01:00:11.812 --> 01:00:13.214
Franzia.

01:00:28.128 --> 01:00:29.430
I'm gonna put my wine down.

01:00:29.463 --> 01:00:30.998
Okay.

01:00:31.031 --> 01:00:33.100
But I'm gonna be right back.

01:00:33.133 --> 01:00:34.335
And now I'm back.

01:00:42.076 --> 01:00:44.044
- Can I, um...
- Do you want to go this side?

01:00:44.078 --> 01:00:46.013
I just wanna go...
I usually go like that side.

01:00:46.046 --> 01:00:47.281
Could you do that...
on that side?

01:00:47.314 --> 01:00:48.515
- Yeah, I'll do this side.
- Okay.

01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:49.783
Okay.

01:00:52.519 --> 01:00:54.188
Whatever.
I can do both, actually.

01:00:54.221 --> 01:00:55.155
Okay.

01:01:00.194 --> 01:01:01.862
I'm skilled
on both sides, too.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.334
I just have to say
right off the top...

01:01:07.368 --> 01:01:08.869
- I like your tongue.
- I was just gonna say

01:01:08.902 --> 01:01:10.037
right off the top,
you are a great kisser.

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:11.472
Thank you so much.
So are you.

01:01:11.505 --> 01:01:12.940
Sometimes you kiss people
and it's not good.

01:01:12.973 --> 01:01:14.174
- It's awful!
- It's terrible.

01:01:14.208 --> 01:01:16.977
But this is great!
Mm. Mm.

01:01:25.019 --> 01:01:28.389
Do you want to go
to your room?

01:01:28.422 --> 01:01:31.325
That's
a very loaded question.

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:34.795
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:39.266 --> 01:01:40.301
Yeah.

01:01:44.972 --> 01:01:46.340
Holy shit, look out!

01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:48.142
<i>Greg's body was tingling</i>

01:01:48.175 --> 01:01:51.278
<i>with the abundant joy
of new love.</i>

01:01:51.312 --> 01:01:55.849
<i>And also with a lot
of nasty sexual stuff.</i>

01:01:55.883 --> 01:01:59.386
<i>His heart was fooled,
his pain was gone,</i>

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.588
<i>and it was all
because of Peyton.</i>

01:02:01.623 --> 01:02:04.124
<i>The only thing Greg
wanted to do</i>

01:02:04.158 --> 01:02:07.161
<i>was run away with her,
get married,</i>

01:02:07.194 --> 01:02:09.129
<i>and live happily ever after.</i>

01:02:51.338 --> 01:02:52.607
Ashley.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.642
Hey, Greg.

01:02:54.676 --> 01:02:57.411
Wow, you look great.

01:02:57.444 --> 01:02:58.479
What are you doing here?

01:02:58.512 --> 01:02:59.647
Can you talk?

01:02:59.681 --> 01:03:03.417
Uh... no.

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:06.453
- Why?
- Not a good time.

01:03:08.188 --> 01:03:10.958
I just need
a few minutes.

01:03:10.991 --> 01:03:13.527
Please, Greg,
it's important.

01:03:15.062 --> 01:03:17.398
- Fine, two minutes.
- All right.

01:03:17.431 --> 01:03:18.599
But don't say anything.

01:03:20.968 --> 01:03:22.403
Okay.

01:03:27.709 --> 01:03:30.511
Greg? Greg?

01:03:34.248 --> 01:03:36.718
I must warn you, though,
this could be

01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:38.385
a natural high of sorts,

01:03:38.419 --> 01:03:41.488
given with your
love addiction and all.

01:03:41.522 --> 01:03:44.726
- Greg?
- Where's my inhaler?

01:03:44.759 --> 01:03:46.160
Excuse me.

01:03:49.229 --> 01:03:51.098
Greg?

01:03:51.131 --> 01:03:52.132
What are you doing?

01:03:55.637 --> 01:03:57.438
- Is she here?
- She's not here.

01:03:57.471 --> 01:03:58.572
She must be in class.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.008
Greg.

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.182
Greg, have you
been drinking?

01:04:10.551 --> 01:04:12.720
<i>Just be
careful not to rush things.</i>

01:04:12.754 --> 01:04:15.422
<i>When seems too good to be true,
it often is.</i>

01:04:15.456 --> 01:04:18.091
Why does everybody
keep saying that to me?

01:04:20.093 --> 01:04:23.497
Please tell me what the hell
is going on here?

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:26.567
I'm in love.
It's my roommate.

01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:28.569
She lives in my apartment
and I'm in love with her

01:04:28.603 --> 01:04:31.171
and I've barely even seen her
or spoken to her.

01:04:31.205 --> 01:04:34.341
It's like I...
she can't be real.

01:04:34.374 --> 01:04:36.376
It's like she's
too good to be true.

01:04:38.646 --> 01:04:40.782
Okay, you're really
freaking me out now, Greg.

01:04:45.052 --> 01:04:47.722
Oh.

01:04:47.755 --> 01:04:51.024
And admit that you have
a love addiction problem

01:04:51.058 --> 01:04:55.062
<i>that needs immediate attention
and aggressive rehabilitation.</i>

01:04:55.095 --> 01:04:58.766
<i>Sometimes the mind creates
a fictional experience,</i>

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.802
a false high,
similar to feelings

01:05:00.835 --> 01:05:04.404
of being lost and emptiness
during depression.

01:05:04.438 --> 01:05:06.406
I don't want you
to get too high

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.644
and then crash
and then take a step backwards.

01:05:09.677 --> 01:05:11.378
Greg?

01:05:16.684 --> 01:05:18.653
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:05:18.686 --> 01:05:20.420
- Are you Greg?
- Yeah.

01:05:20.454 --> 01:05:22.289
Hi, I'm Peyton.

01:05:24.692 --> 01:05:26.761
Oh, yeah, right, no.
I-I'm sorry.

01:05:26.794 --> 01:05:30.665
I didn't... I... my...
I thought that when...

01:05:30.698 --> 01:05:32.232
I thought that Peyton
was a boy's name.

01:05:32.266 --> 01:05:34.501
I... no offense.

01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:38.539
Greg?

01:05:42.509 --> 01:05:43.443
Greg?

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.616
Greg?

01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:50.050
Greg!

01:06:01.896 --> 01:06:03.698
<i>Marilyn French once said,</i>

01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:06.300
<i>"Love is insanity."</i>

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:08.670
<i>It's the taking over
of the rational mind</i>

01:06:08.703 --> 01:06:11.706
<i>by delusion
and self-destruction.</i>

01:06:11.739 --> 01:06:13.373
<i>I think it's fair to say,</i>

01:06:13.407 --> 01:06:15.643
<i>those words ring very true
in my case.</i>

01:06:15.677 --> 01:06:18.345
<i>It's hard to know when my
breakdown officially happened.</i>

01:06:18.378 --> 01:06:20.147
<i>Was it that moment
I answered the front door</i>

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:21.515
<i>and made Peyton up in my mind?</i>

01:06:21.548 --> 01:06:22.784
Hi.

01:06:22.817 --> 01:06:24.384
<i>Was it that moment
Ashley left me</i>

01:06:24.418 --> 01:06:26.320
<i>for our couples therapist,
Dr. Wilbon?</i>

01:06:30.591 --> 01:06:32.794
<i>Or was it something
that was years in the making.</i>

01:06:32.827 --> 01:06:36.764
Yes, yes.
That's his soul mate, yes!

01:06:36.798 --> 01:06:39.166
Oh, God.

01:06:39.199 --> 01:06:43.303
<i>To be honest,
I'm not exactly sure.</i>

01:06:43.337 --> 01:06:45.740
<i>But, look, the good news is
I'm working on getting better.</i>

01:06:45.773 --> 01:06:48.408
<i>Working really, really
freakin' hard.</i>

01:06:48.442 --> 01:06:49.911
<i>Over the past year,</i>

<i>Wait until you see

01:06:57.184 --> 01:06:58.686
Crazy.

01:07:04.859 --> 01:07:07.361
<i>so I can get my fair share
of endorphins.</i>

01:07:08.663 --> 01:07:10.464
<i>It's crazy, right?</i>

01:07:10.497 --> 01:07:12.399
<i>I've even begun meditating,
for crying out loud.</i>

01:07:16.904 --> 01:07:21.174
What the fuck, Mom? I told you
I would call you back.

01:07:21.208 --> 01:07:24.812
Oh, hey, Father O'Connor?
How's it hangin'?

01:07:24.846 --> 01:07:27.347
<i>And my sudden lack of issues</i>

01:07:27.381 --> 01:07:29.549
<i>have vastly improved
Dr. Naik's sleep intake.</i>

01:07:31.218 --> 01:07:32.720
Doc?

01:07:32.754 --> 01:07:35.355
<i>I'm doing some more
adulting these days.</i>

01:07:35.389 --> 01:07:37.591
<i>Like watering the plants.</i>

01:07:37.625 --> 01:07:41.561
<i>And, now I'm purchasing
wine in bottles.</i>

01:07:41.595 --> 01:07:43.798
<i>And I've upgraded
from the microwave,</i>

01:07:43.831 --> 01:07:48.268
<i>to the stove and the oven.</i>

01:07:48.301 --> 01:07:49.671
<i>And Paul and I
are living together now.</i>

01:07:49.704 --> 01:07:51.338
Dude, where are you going?

01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:52.740
<i>It's the only way
he could make sure</i>

01:07:52.774 --> 01:07:54.341
<i>I didn't have
a female roommate.</i>

01:07:54.374 --> 01:07:55.475
- Why are you so sensitive?
- Fuck you, Greg!

01:07:56.778 --> 01:07:58.311
<i>And I actually did
have a mature,</i>

01:07:58.345 --> 01:08:00.615
<i>adult conversation
with Ashley.</i>

01:08:00.648 --> 01:08:02.784
- <i>For real this time.</i>
- That was not...

01:08:02.817 --> 01:08:04.217
<i>And I got some
really nice closure.</i>

01:08:04.251 --> 01:08:05.352
...a good moment for you.

01:08:05.385 --> 01:08:06.921
<i>And to top that all off,</i>

01:08:06.954 --> 01:08:07.989
<i>I've been drinking
a Los Angelan amount</i>

01:08:08.022 --> 01:08:09.957
<i>of green juice smoothies.</i>

01:08:09.991 --> 01:08:11.626
<i>Which you can presume
reminds me of you-know-who</i>

01:08:11.659 --> 01:08:13.226
<i>every time I drink one.</i>

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.395
Yeah, are you a Broncos fan?

01:08:15.429 --> 01:08:17.765
<i>Oh, God, there she is, huh?</i>

01:08:17.799 --> 01:08:19.533
<i>The one and only gorgeous,
Peyton.</i>

01:08:19.566 --> 01:08:22.469
<i>Man, she was awesome,
wasn't she?</i>

01:08:22.502 --> 01:08:24.805
<i>I totally concur.</i>

01:08:24.839 --> 01:08:27.274
<i>And look, I promise you
however disappointed</i>

01:08:27.307 --> 01:08:28.776
<i>you are right now
that she wasn't real,</i>

01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:30.978
<i>I am exponentially
more upset about it.</i>

01:08:31.011 --> 01:08:32.714
<i>You have to admit,</i>

01:08:32.747 --> 01:08:33.881
<i>I might just have
some potential as a writer</i>

01:08:33.915 --> 01:08:35.750
<i>after all, right?</i>

01:08:35.783 --> 01:08:37.283
<i>I mean, I did create her
in my mind, didn't I?</i>

01:08:39.687 --> 01:08:41.520
<i>And I used this whole
crazy experience</i>

01:08:41.555 --> 01:08:43.791
<i>for creative inspiration,
and I started writing again.</i>

01:08:43.825 --> 01:08:45.492
<i>I actually wrote
a short story called,</i>

01:08:45.524 --> 01:08:48.428
Poor Greg Drowning:
The Story of a Love Addict.

01:08:48.462 --> 01:08:50.397
<i>It was recently published
in a local magazine,</i>

01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:54.035
<i>and now, it's being adapted
into an animated miniseries.</i>

01:08:54.068 --> 01:08:55.737
<i>It's officially
been a year</i>

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:58.505
<i>since I was violently
thrashing rock bottom.</i>

01:08:58.537 --> 01:09:00.540
<i>And I'm hosting a little
shindig at the casa</i>

01:09:00.573 --> 01:09:02.509
<i>de Paul and Greg tonight
to celebrate.</i>

01:09:02.542 --> 01:09:04.310
<i>And you're all invited.</i>

01:09:04.344 --> 01:09:07.014
<i>So I'll see you there
in three, two, one...</i>

01:09:09.984 --> 01:09:11.719
I still can't believe
you guys are dating.

01:09:11.752 --> 01:09:13.955
What can I say?
She's got the best perennials

01:09:13.988 --> 01:09:15.823
on the entire block.

01:09:15.857 --> 01:09:17.557
Right, that's what it is.

01:09:17.591 --> 01:09:19.627
No, seriously, Miss D,
I need to know.

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:21.929
What's your secret to sprouting
those gorgeous flush perennials

01:09:21.962 --> 01:09:24.631
in this crippling drought?

01:09:24.665 --> 01:09:26.901
Okay, if you must know...

01:09:30.437 --> 01:09:31.906
You boys have fun.

01:09:31.939 --> 01:09:34.841
Wow, that's incredible.

01:09:34.876 --> 01:09:38.310
Listen, bro.
I am really proud of you.

01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:40.479
You had some major issues

01:09:40.514 --> 01:09:43.517
and you nutted up,
faced 'em like a man.

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:44.652
Congrats, my brother.

01:09:44.685 --> 01:09:47.822
Thanks, man.

01:09:47.854 --> 01:09:49.023
Should we hug it out?

01:09:49.055 --> 01:09:51.291
Sure.

01:09:53.694 --> 01:09:55.362
- All right
- Mm.

01:10:03.137 --> 01:10:07.407
I want to second what our wise
young friend just said here.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.478
You've come a long way, Greg.
I'm very, very proud of you.

01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:13.981
Aw. Holy shit.
You two?

01:10:14.015 --> 01:10:15.016
Congrats!

01:10:15.049 --> 01:10:16.851
Thank you.

01:10:16.884 --> 01:10:19.486
I'm so happy
and proud for you.

01:10:19.519 --> 01:10:21.923
Listen, he may have
put a ring on it,

01:10:21.956 --> 01:10:24.725
but I've still got a list
with your name on it,

01:10:24.759 --> 01:10:29.462
just in case you're ever
feeling a little inspired.

01:10:29.496 --> 01:10:32.900
All right, wow.
Thank you.

01:10:35.069 --> 01:10:36.503
I'll catch you guys
in just a little bit.

01:10:38.572 --> 01:10:42.777
You smell so good.

01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:45.412
And what's your name?

01:10:45.445 --> 01:10:46.781
I'm Paul.

01:10:51.418 --> 01:10:52.887
- There he is!
- Hey

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.089
Hey!
Oh, it's so good.

01:10:55.122 --> 01:10:57.457
Gregorino!

01:10:57.490 --> 01:10:59.060
- Hi.
- Okay. Okay, let go.

01:10:59.093 --> 01:11:01.028
- Mm-hmm. 'Kay.
- Now sit.

01:11:01.062 --> 01:11:03.030
'Kay.
How are you feeling?

01:11:03.064 --> 01:11:04.665
Yeah, really good, actually.
Yeah.

01:11:04.699 --> 01:11:07.001
That's great.
So, did you talk to Ashley?

01:11:07.034 --> 01:11:08.703
Yeah, she's been really
supportive through all this.

01:11:08.736 --> 01:11:11.404
And I think taking the time
really made me realize

01:11:11.438 --> 01:11:13.174
what I was doing wrong
in the relationship

01:11:13.207 --> 01:11:15.009
and why she did what she did.

01:11:15.042 --> 01:11:17.612
Not that that's an excuse,
but it's not all her fault.

01:11:17.645 --> 01:11:18.946
No way.
She's a bitch.

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:21.716
That's her fault.

01:11:21.749 --> 01:11:22.917
- Dan.
- Right?

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:25.552
No.
I'm really proud of you.

01:11:25.585 --> 01:11:26.787
It's not easy
to look in the mirror

01:11:26.821 --> 01:11:29.090
- and examine your own self.
- Yeah.

01:11:29.123 --> 01:11:30.691
Have you had any more
of those hallucinations?

01:11:30.725 --> 01:11:32.960
Yeah, I have.
Oh, Gregarino?

01:11:32.994 --> 01:11:34.896
- Not you.
- Nope.

01:11:34.929 --> 01:11:36.596
- That's great.
- Yeah.

01:11:36.631 --> 01:11:40.034
It's so weird though
because she was so real.

01:11:40.067 --> 01:11:41.769
I know, but you remember
what they said.

01:11:41.802 --> 01:11:43.004
That can be common
when you're going through

01:11:43.037 --> 01:11:45.006
- that sort of thing.
- Yeah. I know.

01:11:45.039 --> 01:11:49.576
Could she open a door
on her own?

01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:51.112
No, it wasn't real.

01:11:51.145 --> 01:11:53.480
It's a hallu...

01:11:53.513 --> 01:11:56.117
Just have... stop.

01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:57.450
There's that pussy boy!

01:11:57.484 --> 01:12:00.788
Aw, my Trojan warrior!
Ah!

01:12:00.821 --> 01:12:04.892
I still can't believe that
you're Greg's sponsor, Hector.

01:12:04.926 --> 01:12:07.094
Who would have thought? Universe
works in mysterious ways.

01:12:07.128 --> 01:12:09.063
- You are not kidding.
- I am not.

01:12:09.096 --> 01:12:11.799
What a funny, funny world!

01:12:14.135 --> 01:12:17.537
I'm just happy this soldier's
back on the squad.

01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:20.141
Yeah, thanks, man.

01:12:20.174 --> 01:12:23.911
Oh, shit!
No they didn't!

01:12:23.945 --> 01:12:26.681
- Hi!
- Hey, Mom!

01:12:26.714 --> 01:12:29.250
There's your Mom
and her female lover.

01:12:29.283 --> 01:12:30.785
Right?

01:12:30.818 --> 01:12:33.821
- You look great.
- Yeah, thanks, so do you!

01:12:33.854 --> 01:12:36.523
And this place, wow,
it's incredible!

01:12:36.556 --> 01:12:37.892
I know, right?
I'm all, living with Paul

01:12:37.925 --> 01:12:39.760
certainly has its perks.

01:12:39.794 --> 01:12:42.697
- Which one's his mom?
- That's my mom!

01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:44.531
So, how's my favorite broad
in the whole wide world doing?

01:12:44.564 --> 01:12:45.733
I am doing great.

01:12:45.766 --> 01:12:47.902
I may or may not have engineered

01:12:47.935 --> 01:12:50.071
a quick little pit stop
at the old In-N-Out

01:12:50.104 --> 01:12:52.239
- on the way here.
- Oh, shit!

01:12:52.273 --> 01:12:54.909
- Animal style!?
- It's the only way.

01:12:54.942 --> 01:12:57.178
Unh!

01:12:57.211 --> 01:12:58.612
I'm sorry, Mary Jane!

01:12:58.646 --> 01:12:59.981
How's my favorite
step-mom doing?

01:13:00.014 --> 01:13:01.882
She is doing great,
sweetheart.

01:13:01.916 --> 01:13:04.551
- Oh, it's good to see you.
- Oh, it's good to see you, too.

01:13:04.584 --> 01:13:06.220
Although, I have to admit,
I am a little queasy

01:13:06.253 --> 01:13:08.856
from the drive,
your mother on the 405.

01:13:08.889 --> 01:13:09.991
The woman drives
like a battle axe.

01:13:10.024 --> 01:13:12.026
Would you hush it up, MJ?

01:13:12.059 --> 01:13:16.230
I love riling you up.
Isn't she the cutest?

01:13:16.263 --> 01:13:19.532
- She sure is.
- And Father O'Connor!

01:13:19.566 --> 01:13:21.736
How is my favorite man
of the big man upstairs doing!?

01:13:24.705 --> 01:13:27.074
How many times do I have
to tell you, Greg?

01:13:27.108 --> 01:13:28.575
I'm not a Father.
I'm a Rabbi.

01:13:28.609 --> 01:13:29.810
I'm Jewish.

01:13:29.844 --> 01:13:31.112
Well, bless you either way.

01:13:31.145 --> 01:13:32.913
Thank you.

01:13:32.947 --> 01:13:34.715
All right, I'm gonna go outside
and get some fresh air.

01:13:34.749 --> 01:13:36.250
- You want some company?
- No, no, it's okay.

01:13:36.283 --> 01:13:37.785
You guys, you guys...
I'll just be a second.

01:13:37.818 --> 01:13:39.220
- You guys go mingle.
- All righty.

01:13:39.253 --> 01:13:43.724
We'll go say hi to Jules
and her odd boyfriend.

01:13:43.758 --> 01:13:45.259
Mr. Stiffy.

01:13:45.292 --> 01:13:46.293
One would hope.

01:14:18.626 --> 01:14:22.096
Peyton?
