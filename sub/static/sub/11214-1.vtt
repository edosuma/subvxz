01:41.869 --> 01:45.906
(women screaming)

01:45.906 --> 01:48.709
(sirens wailing)

01:48.709 --> 01:51.145
You okay, son?

01:54.047 --> 01:55.849
You okay, son?!

01:55.849 --> 01:57.551
(camera shutter clicks)

01:57.551 --> 01:59.086
NARRATOR:
Ben Sherman just finished
phase one

01:59.086 --> 02:01.289
of his probationary training.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.123
He still needed
to have his daily book

02:03.123 --> 02:05.593
signed by his training officer.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.761
The night had not gone well.

02:07.761 --> 02:11.332
(cocking gun)
Look sharp. Act sharp. Be sharp.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.966
These guys coming out of prison,

02:12.966 --> 02:14.602
they're buff and on drugs.

02:14.602 --> 02:17.405
You do what they teach you
in the academy, you will die.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.640
Knucklehead wants
to take your gun.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.710
So, if it's you or some
300-pound naked guy on PCP,

02:22.710 --> 02:25.179
you take his ass down
any way you can.

02:25.179 --> 02:26.680
You ride with me,
you back your badge.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.084
Whoa...

02:31.084 --> 02:32.653
Great, that's all I need.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.988
Nice little staph infection.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.858
Detective over at Central,
she's gonna lose her foot.

02:37.858 --> 02:41.229
It's going around.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.404
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:50.404 --> 02:53.407
Roll down your window.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.876
When'd you get out of the
academy? About a month ago?

02:55.876 --> 02:57.878
Yes, sir.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.347
You know your penal codes?

02:59.347 --> 03:00.814
Yes, sir.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.884
What's a 203?

03:03.884 --> 03:05.819
Mayhem, sir.
Mayhem...

03:06.920 --> 03:09.257
I get this mayhem one time,

03:09.257 --> 03:10.891
go over to Killer King,

03:10.891 --> 03:13.026
there's this guy with a little
tent over his genitals.

03:13.026 --> 03:17.498
Doc keeps, you know, signaling
for me to look under there.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.668
This guy had scooped out
his nuts with a spoon.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.936
(laughing)

03:22.936 --> 03:25.038
He said they'd gotten him
into trouble his whole life.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.308
So, I took a Polaroid, right?
Put the picture in my pocket.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.909
Captain shows up.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.210
You know what he says?

03:30.210 --> 03:34.582
"Make sure you attach
the picture to the report."

03:37.150 --> 03:40.220
What are you? Canadian?

03:41.989 --> 03:44.925
(indistinct radio transmission)

03:50.798 --> 03:54.468
(ball thudding)

04:06.714 --> 04:09.016
Great...

04:09.016 --> 04:10.083
Barry the Basehead...

04:10.083 --> 04:12.786
he's spun.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.823
Meth-- it gives him
that disheveled look.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.958
Hey, hey, shitbird,
how you doing?

04:17.958 --> 04:20.861
A friend of mine has a kitten,
and it won't come off the roof.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.563
Yeah, well, usually a cat
gets up on its own,

04:22.563 --> 04:24.532
it can get down on its own.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.634
No, man, my friend
threw it up there.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.103
You are too stupid to live.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.872
Get out of here.

04:39.079 --> 04:42.282
asshole rodeo.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.921
Hey, you can't take my phone.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.923
Stop wiggin. I'm gonna
just borrow it.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.224
I'm calling Ma!

04:51.224 --> 04:52.626
So, call her.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.562
Try to explain to her
why you still at home

04:54.562 --> 04:56.564
on a school day.
I got strep throat

04:56.564 --> 04:59.099
and that girl
you texting with is a ho.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.067
Chill, li'l sis.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.902
Ooh, I hate you!

05:01.902 --> 05:02.903
(huffs)

05:05.473 --> 05:08.609
No, I did not have a woman
in the car with me.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.546
I can't talk about this now.
I gotta go.

05:14.748 --> 05:15.883
Hey, Brian.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.184
Yeah?

05:17.184 --> 05:19.052
You closed Suarez?

05:19.052 --> 05:20.220
He copped out to you?

05:20.220 --> 05:21.489
I reread the transcripts.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.856
He confessed telephonically.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.625
Excellent.
What'd I miss?

05:24.625 --> 05:26.126
Anything good happen?

05:26.126 --> 05:28.061
Didn't you deport that
little buster "Droopy"

05:28.061 --> 05:29.262
from over at Leimert Park?

05:29.262 --> 05:30.364
Yeah, Miguel Ramos.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.932
What happened?
He, uh,

05:31.932 --> 05:35.068
raped and murdered this girl
last Friday.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.169
Well, God bless America.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.905
How was Cancun?

05:37.905 --> 05:39.306
Oh, it was good.

05:39.306 --> 05:41.174
If I ever talk about marriage
again, tell me to go out,

05:41.174 --> 05:43.811
find some chick I don't like
and buy her a house instead.

05:43.811 --> 05:44.678
Sammy's wife just
kicked him out.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.113
The first marriage?

05:46.113 --> 05:47.715
Don't even count.
That's a starter marriage.

05:47.715 --> 05:48.916
Didn't you, uh, didn't you take

05:48.916 --> 05:50.518
that crazy bomb dog,
had a breakdown?

05:50.518 --> 05:52.586
Uh, drug dog, Richter.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.488
He's doing better.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.357
We put him on medication
for Delayed Stress Syndrome.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.559
My wife?

05:58.559 --> 06:00.494
Hates him though.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.435
Yeah, I'm almost there.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.080
Hey, cuz, where you from?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.882
I don't bang.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.904
They said they didn't
see anything.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.308
And they're crying because...?

06:48.308 --> 06:50.377
Bring them in.

06:50.377 --> 06:51.679
Hey, you guys wanna
know how to stop

06:51.679 --> 06:53.380
all this gang-bangin'?

06:53.380 --> 06:55.282
Then start giving them all
free marijuana.

06:55.282 --> 06:58.185
If not, we're gonna see
this shit over and
over and over again.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.220
Thank you, sir.
And that's all you keep
saying is "thank you."

07:00.220 --> 07:02.255
We're gonna bring it up at
the next city council meeting.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.658
I promise you.
I promise you.
I wanna see this stop!

07:08.228 --> 07:09.897
I turned my back for one minute.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.499
I mean, one minute, you know?

07:11.499 --> 07:13.066
She plays there all the time.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.702
Are you high?! Are you?!

07:14.702 --> 07:16.103
Whoa, whoa.
What did you do with her?!

07:16.103 --> 07:17.571
I didn't do anything!
What did you do?!

07:17.571 --> 07:19.006
No, no, where is my daughter?!
Where?!

07:19.006 --> 07:21.174
Ms. Davis, Ms. Davis,
I'm Detective Adams.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.744
I can only imagine
how upsetting this is for you.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.178
No...
Okay, we're doing

07:25.178 --> 07:26.714
everything that we can
to find Kayla.

07:26.714 --> 07:29.750
Sometimes kids just wander off.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.658
(tires screeching)

07:37.658 --> 07:39.159
You gotta be kidding me.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.427
Light him up.

07:40.427 --> 07:43.864
(siren whooping)

07:58.345 --> 07:59.680
Get out of the car.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.448
Why do I have to get
out of the car?

08:01.448 --> 08:03.150
Get out of the car
now, numbnuts.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.352
Know who my father is?

08:05.352 --> 08:07.655
Why? Your mother
didn't tell you?

08:07.655 --> 08:09.256
Step to the curb.

08:10.791 --> 08:14.494
Dude, you became an actor?

08:14.494 --> 08:15.763
I'm not an actor.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.430
I'm being punk'd, right?

08:17.430 --> 08:19.667
Search the car.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.134
Hey, you're making
a big mistake.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.971
You can't search my car
without just cause.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.205
(chuckling)

08:25.205 --> 08:27.207
You're watching way
too much TV, dude.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.143
Put your hands on the car,
palms down; spread your legs.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.645
What, you're arresting me?

08:31.645 --> 08:33.313
What are the charges?
No charge.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.183
The services of the LAPD--
see, they're free for you.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.217
You're a dick!

08:37.217 --> 08:41.254
Yeah? Cops have feelings
too, you know?

08:41.254 --> 08:43.390
Now I'm gonna need a hug.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.558
Hook him up.

08:48.428 --> 08:51.431
Hey, Ben, right?

08:51.431 --> 08:53.000
Can you help me
out here, dude?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.334
No.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.637
Fine, I'll hire your dad.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.805
He'll come bail me out.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.372
He know
you're doing this?

08:59.372 --> 09:02.175
He must be real proud.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.752
(cell phone ringing)

09:11.752 --> 09:13.754
(heart monitor beeping)

09:13.754 --> 09:17.024
(beeping and ringing continue)

09:23.096 --> 09:25.532
When is somebody gonna
claim this kid?

09:25.532 --> 09:26.934
He's got no ID.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.468
Does the tattoo
tell you anything?

09:28.468 --> 09:29.502
He a Blood? Is...

09:29.502 --> 09:31.705
I don't think so.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.642
(cell phone ringing)

09:36.143 --> 09:38.311
(siren whooping)

09:42.149 --> 09:45.318
I'm gonna get you
something hot to drink.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.254
What would you like?

09:49.189 --> 09:51.925
WOMAN:
Hurry, hurry.
We know this girl.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.261
Give her a hot tea
with some honey.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.796
We know this girl.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.397
We like her very much.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.832
Always playing.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.669
We say hello
and, um, so forth.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.303
What we can do to help?

10:03.303 --> 10:05.205
Is there anything
we can do to help?
I'm sorry.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.340
My son Arsham.
I am Agata.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.508
We live right here.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.177
Do not hesitate.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.278
Thank you.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.814
And if you see anything,
just let us know.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.248
Thank you.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.217
I seen her just last night
coming home with her dad

10:17.217 --> 10:18.185
and she had on this,

10:18.185 --> 10:20.120
this heavy bookbag
on her shoulders

10:20.120 --> 10:21.722
and it was
weighing her down,

10:21.722 --> 10:23.691
so, she was walking
real slow.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.025
I mean, they're
real heavy nowadays.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.794
You ever notice that?
Uh-huh.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.528
I'm thinking that
this is a little kid.

10:28.528 --> 10:29.529
I mean, why do
they have to lug

10:29.529 --> 10:31.331
all that heavy crap around?

10:31.331 --> 10:33.166
You know, why can't her dad
just carry it?

10:33.166 --> 10:35.769
I mean, she was...
she was little for her age.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.706
I mean, kids nowadays
are so developed.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.507
But she wasn't. She...

10:40.507 --> 10:41.909
She looked like
a little kid.

10:41.909 --> 10:46.113
Um, you guys are
all being so helpful.

10:46.113 --> 10:49.349
Uh, you think I can get your
names down here just in case

10:49.349 --> 10:51.484
I need to contact you?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.787
(Agata speaking Armenian)

10:55.122 --> 10:58.058
(sirens wailing)

11:03.163 --> 11:06.199
MAN:
Hey, what do you call two female
officers in a squad car?

11:06.199 --> 11:08.001
A tuna boat.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.536
Oh, yeah!
(groans)

11:09.536 --> 11:10.938
(laughing)

11:10.938 --> 11:13.106
Hey, Chickie's thinking
about going to SWAT.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.075
She should go to SWAT.
She rocks.
Yeah.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.744
How many times
you win Baker to Vegas?

11:16.744 --> 11:17.778
Four.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.046
Four times.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.413
It's this relay race
in the desert.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.015
Chickie's our star.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.450
DISPATCH:
All units: we have
a critical missing.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.952
Described as a ten-year-old
white female,

11:24.952 --> 11:27.220
last seen at Fountain and Virgil

11:27.220 --> 11:29.923
wearing a pink tank top,
tan skirt, and pink sneakers.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.458
Clear us
from code seven.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.393
Show us handling.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.262
Later, guys.
See you guys.

11:35.262 --> 11:38.231
Why don't you get
an all-female SWAT
while you're at it?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.300
That way you can just
get people together
and nag suspects

11:40.300 --> 11:41.568
till they come out.
Nee-nee-nee-nee.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.036
COOPER:
Dewey, shut up.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.404
You're giving me
a headache.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.006
You really think

11:46.006 --> 11:48.141
you can drag a 200-pound man
out of bad scene?

11:48.141 --> 11:49.242
With all his gear
and his weapons?

11:49.242 --> 11:50.610
COOPER:
Keep it up, Dewey.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.412
I'll knock you out
and we can see.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.614
Hey, you know what's wrong
with this guy?

11:54.614 --> 11:55.849
He come he's quiet?

11:55.849 --> 11:57.184
He's Canadian
or something.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.386
Where you from
in Canada?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.388
Hmm? Mmm.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.223
I'm not Canadian.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.324
Whoa!

12:06.426 --> 12:07.594
Get off, man.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.429
DEWEY:
Hey, easy, kid.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.131
(Dewey laughing)

12:18.171 --> 12:20.307
(car door alarm bell dinging)

12:22.242 --> 12:25.378
So we got a warrant
on that blond kid Dwayne,

12:25.378 --> 12:27.214
but I need you to get her
out of here.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.282
Take her to get some coffee,
all right?
Okay.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.484
And I'll let you know
when we're done.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.486
Sounds good.
Russ?

12:33.486 --> 12:35.388
She has people she can call.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.290
Get her to do that.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.827
I'm sure she has
friends, family.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.195
Get her to call
somebody, okay?

12:42.195 --> 12:43.363
(sighs)

12:43.363 --> 12:45.365
Okay.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.300
Yeah.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.204
(car door alarm bell dinging)

12:52.973 --> 12:55.342
DISPATCH:
Any available unit: neighbors
have reported a bad smell

12:55.342 --> 12:58.345
coming from 322 Wilcox,
apartment A.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.480
It's probably
a DB call.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.550
By the time you pull
in the driveway

13:03.550 --> 13:05.152
you should know what you have:

13:05.152 --> 13:07.654
the hair on your arms
tells you.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.789
Buy the call.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.726
Show us handling.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.728
So, what is this
for you?

13:15.728 --> 13:16.964
It's gonna look good
on the resume?

13:16.964 --> 13:18.298
Nice little

13:18.298 --> 13:21.534
steppingstone till you land
that cushy job?

13:21.534 --> 13:23.536
Go be a slapdick somewhere?

13:23.536 --> 13:25.338
Sound about right?

13:25.338 --> 13:27.207
I'm a cop, same
as you're a cop, sir.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.442
Oh, I doubt that,
Richie Rich.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.579
You got 90210 written
all over your face.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.450
(phone ringing)

13:39.887 --> 13:41.922
What do you want?

13:41.922 --> 13:44.457
Come home
and make a baby with me.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.725
Do you still love me?

13:45.725 --> 13:47.060
I still love you, Sammy.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.661
It's not that simple.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.063
Why not?

13:50.063 --> 13:51.564
Why not? Of course it is.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.234
Because we don't have that much
in common anymore.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.303
Oh, so who do you have stuff
in common with,

13:56.303 --> 13:58.338
all those badge bunnies
lining up to blow you?

13:58.338 --> 14:01.074
I told you
I'm not seeing anybody else.

14:01.074 --> 14:04.077
Why aren't we close anymore?

14:04.077 --> 14:06.113
(sniffling)

14:06.113 --> 14:08.148
Why don't we make love?

14:08.148 --> 14:09.649
I don't... I don't know.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.919
I mean, I get... I get...

14:11.919 --> 14:13.686
I get... I'm not doing this.
I gotta go.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.687
Don't go.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.023
I gotta go, Tammi. Good-bye.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.091
Fine. I'm keeping the dog.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.093
You hate the dog!

14:20.093 --> 14:22.062
You hate the dog.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.366
(sighs)

14:30.470 --> 14:31.638
Hey.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.973
I'm Detective Bryant,

14:32.973 --> 14:34.975
and I appreciate
what you're doing.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.444
Uh, which one of you is Nyesha?

14:41.348 --> 14:44.117
Um, do you mind coming
in this room over here

14:44.117 --> 14:45.552
to talk to me and my partner?

14:45.552 --> 14:47.354
Mom says not to.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.556
To wait till she gets here.
That's all right.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.359
Uh, who is...

14:52.359 --> 14:54.294
Janila? Janila?

14:55.828 --> 14:57.030
Do you mind talking to me?

14:57.030 --> 14:59.032
It's okay.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.800
Good, thank you.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.834
Um...

15:01.834 --> 15:04.304
you're Tanya?

15:04.304 --> 15:05.638
Ah.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.474
Ha-ha-ha.
We just want

15:07.474 --> 15:10.477
to get a general idea of what
you guys saw this morning, okay?

15:10.477 --> 15:12.679
NYESHA:
We gonna have
to go to court?

15:12.679 --> 15:15.482
No, where'd you hear that?

15:15.482 --> 15:18.485
I-I don't even remember
your names.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.720
I-I could give you
some code names.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.422
You want to do that?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.257
Yeah?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.193
Come on.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.314
I smell this
from two blocks away.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.216
Turn the electricity off?
No.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.785
Telling me
the truth?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.154
He doesn't pay his rent.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.822
(dogs barking)
What am I supposed
to do?

15:55.822 --> 15:57.690
He's got dogs.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.692
I forgot.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.694
Hello?

16:01.694 --> 16:03.696
Sir?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.632
(barking continues)

16:07.867 --> 16:09.869
Call Animal Control.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.705
1585, request Animal Control.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.641
Our location.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.182
Something's going on,
right?

16:22.182 --> 16:24.317
That's why you brought me here.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.323
Could you tell me
what it is, please?

16:32.859 --> 16:36.196
Look, I'm never going
to lie to you, okay?

16:39.466 --> 16:41.468
Ms. Davis?

16:41.468 --> 16:43.036
Look at me.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.074
I promise.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.377
Hey.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.447
I promise.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.615
Okay?

16:57.817 --> 16:59.819
(dogs barking)

16:59.819 --> 17:01.754
We're ready.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.698
(dogs growling, barking)

17:36.589 --> 17:38.591
(Cooper sighs)

17:59.179 --> 18:01.314
(Sherman moans)

18:06.853 --> 18:09.789
(gagging)

18:10.890 --> 18:12.825
(panting)

18:18.698 --> 18:20.500
(growls, whines)

18:20.500 --> 18:22.202
You sure you gotta
put 'em down?

18:22.202 --> 18:23.436
I'll take 'em.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.438
That little pink nose--
kind of a sweetie.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.474
WOMAN:
He's tasted
human flesh.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.409
Once they've tasted human flesh,
you just can't be sure.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.411
Yeah, well, I went south
on my wife about a year ago,

18:31.411 --> 18:32.645
you gotta put me down?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.447
(Dewey laughing)

18:34.447 --> 18:36.149
DEWEY:
What the hell's wrong
with your partner?

18:36.149 --> 18:37.517
He looks kind of
sick down there.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.819
Yeah, Tori Spelling
threw up

18:39.819 --> 18:42.822
all over his brand-new
patent leather Mary Janes.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.358
You guys be nice
when you say good-bye today.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.227
It could be his last day
on the job.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.529
No, no, no, no, no.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.564
Do not let him
get to you.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.999
It's not personal,
you know.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.501
What is his
problem?!

18:54.501 --> 18:57.570
There's a lot of theories
on that one.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.641
Why you wearing
purple, Janila?

19:01.641 --> 19:04.777
You affiliated
with Grape Street?

19:08.781 --> 19:10.717
That's cool.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.922
You got a boyfriend
in Grape Street?

19:17.023 --> 19:19.158
Yeah.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.864
Janila,

19:24.864 --> 19:27.267
help me out here.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.968
I promise you,
I'll keep you out of it.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.003
It don't work
like that.
Where did you hear that?

19:31.003 --> 19:34.574
I learned that
before I learned the alphabet.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.442
(laughs)

19:35.442 --> 19:38.144
BRYANT:
You're cute.

19:38.144 --> 19:41.147
I went on
the Web site once.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.149
You think I could
be a cop?

19:43.149 --> 19:44.451
Sure.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.726
OFFICER:
Clear.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.662
It's clear.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.965
OFFICER 2:
It's clear.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.841
OFFICER 3:
Detective Adams?

20:21.354 --> 20:22.489
APB's been put out.
Good.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.357
If he comes home,
put out a call.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.992
I don't want him spooked
and taking off.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.394
Nobody goes near

20:27.394 --> 20:29.429
this apartment just
in case he's watching.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.532
Stay out of sight
and on the radio.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.569
(siren whooping in distance)

20:53.720 --> 20:56.723
DISPATCH:
Uh, can I have a backup
on Morris?

20:56.723 --> 20:59.959
COOPER:
Hey, baby, show me your tits.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.594
(laughing)

21:11.304 --> 21:13.340
Yeah, no freebies
for you, asshole.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.274
Mmm. Shawna, Ben.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.509
Ben, Shawna.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.777
Hey.
SHAWNA:
Howdy.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.779
I trained this
crazy chick.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.982
Shawna works Vice
in case you didn't guess.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.717
Where's the guys?

21:24.717 --> 21:25.685
Oh...

21:28.355 --> 21:31.458
(laughs)

21:43.536 --> 21:46.373
(laughing):
Oh, Mr. Holmes,

21:46.373 --> 21:48.608
could I just touch it once?

21:48.608 --> 21:50.877
I heard it's really big.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.011
It's huge, bro.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.179
(laughter)
This is Ben.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.347
Ben, I'd like
you to meet

21:54.347 --> 21:55.948
two of the biggest
degenerates

21:55.948 --> 21:57.617
I have the pleasure of knowing:
it's Vid and Eddie.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.719
What's his story?

21:59.719 --> 22:02.922
He's working the bushes
at Barnsdall Park.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.657
COOPER:
Barnsdall, right.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.393
It's this public
park, right?

22:06.393 --> 22:08.327
Has these huge
posted signs, like,

22:08.327 --> 22:09.529
(shouting):
every two feet.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.798
"This area is
under surveillance

22:11.798 --> 22:14.534
by the Los
Angeles Police."

22:14.534 --> 22:15.535
(laughter)

22:15.535 --> 22:17.570
Freaking idiot.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.406
(radio crackles)

22:19.406 --> 22:21.408
MAN:
How... How much?

22:21.408 --> 22:23.510
SHAWNA:
Depends.
What'd you have in mind?

22:23.510 --> 22:24.477
MAN:
I don't know.

22:24.477 --> 22:25.678
The act and the price.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.814
You got to say it
out loud, dude!

22:27.814 --> 22:31.250
MAN:
Fif... 50 bucks
for a blow-and-go?

22:31.250 --> 22:32.452
EDDIE:
Bingo!

22:32.452 --> 22:33.786
SHAWNA:
Just get out of here, okay?

22:33.786 --> 22:35.054
EDDIE:
She had him.
What is she doing?

22:35.054 --> 22:36.523
SHAWNA:
What's the matter with you?

22:36.523 --> 22:37.790
MAN:
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.191
What's the
matter with me?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.226
You're on...
You're on the street

22:40.226 --> 22:41.293
selling your
body for sex.

22:41.293 --> 22:42.595
Yeah? Well, I'm not the one

22:42.595 --> 22:44.764
with a baby in a car seat
in the backseat,

22:44.764 --> 22:46.032
you asshole.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.000
Just get out of here, okay?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.101
I'm a cop,

22:49.101 --> 22:50.437
you moron!

22:50.437 --> 22:53.305
(tires squealing)

22:53.305 --> 22:54.441
Nice hanging
with you guys.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.374
VID:
Later, bro.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.709
Later. Nice
meeting you.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.778
See you, man. Sure.
Yeah, take it easy.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.948
It's like driving
through the sewer

23:01.948 --> 23:04.116
in a glass-bottom
boat, right?

23:05.618 --> 23:08.555
We getting to you, boot?

23:08.555 --> 23:10.923
You don't think
you can handle it,

23:10.923 --> 23:13.025
get out now.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.127
Do us all a favor.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.329
Quit.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.198
What right you got
to keep my kid?

23:19.198 --> 23:20.600
You don't have the right

23:20.600 --> 23:23.235
to interview a 14-year-old
without a parent!

23:23.235 --> 23:25.204
Let's go, the both of you.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.806
Where's Tanya?

23:26.806 --> 23:28.675
Baby, your mama's coming.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.042
You keep your
mouth shut.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.244
Listen, I don't want
to offend you in any way,

23:32.244 --> 23:33.480
but this was
an attempted murder,

23:33.480 --> 23:34.514
and these girls
were witnesses.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.615
You threatening me?

23:35.615 --> 23:37.517
No, we're not
threatening you.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.018
We're asking you for your help.

23:39.018 --> 23:40.753
If it ever came down to them
having to go to court,

23:40.753 --> 23:42.054
which would not happen--

23:42.054 --> 23:44.356
but if it did,
we could move you.

23:44.356 --> 23:45.492
Move me?

23:45.492 --> 23:47.026
I'm not moving anywhere.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.628
Where do you live, sir?

23:48.628 --> 23:49.629
Where do I live?

23:49.629 --> 23:52.298
That's right.

23:52.298 --> 23:54.100
I live in Castaic.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.402
When you live around here,
in this world,

23:56.402 --> 23:58.170
with what we got going on,

23:58.170 --> 24:01.040
then you got the right
to tell me what to do.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.109
Let's go, the
both of you. Now!

24:03.109 --> 24:05.612
You have anything else
you want to ask me,

24:05.612 --> 24:07.780
I got free incoming.
You can call me.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.916
He calls you, he
better get a lawyer.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.184
Come on, girls. Let's
get out of here. Come on.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.921
She's definitely
filing a complaint.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.223
FEMALE DISPATCHER:
All units, I have a Code 2

24:17.223 --> 24:19.626
call for Unknown Trouble
at Fletcher and 136th Street.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.460
Neighbors are complaining
about noise.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.562
We're end of watch now.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.831
What do you want to do?

24:24.831 --> 24:27.667
Unknown troubles
can be funky.

24:31.403 --> 24:34.574
15-A-85, show us
responding Code 2

24:34.574 --> 24:36.643
to Fletcher and 136th Street.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.449
MORETTA:
When we spoke earlier,

24:43.449 --> 24:46.586
you said you had a pretty
good view of those men

24:46.586 --> 24:48.420
from the front window
of that bus.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.356
"I got a
good look

24:50.356 --> 24:51.991
at all three
of those boys."

24:51.991 --> 24:53.860
No, no.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.194
I never said that.

24:55.194 --> 24:56.596
BRYANT:
Excuse me. Uh,

24:56.596 --> 24:57.697
does he have to be here?

24:57.697 --> 24:58.665
I'm her ex.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.567
BRYANT:
Yeah?

25:00.567 --> 25:01.568
You live here?

25:01.568 --> 25:02.802
Came to see my kid.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.573
Well, your kid's
not here.

25:06.573 --> 25:08.240
(siren blaring)

25:08.240 --> 25:09.275
(Bryant sighs)

25:09.275 --> 25:10.442
Thanks.

25:10.442 --> 25:11.611
(sighs)

25:11.611 --> 25:13.445
Wait. You got to understand.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.582
I lost two nephews.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.684
My best friend
lost her son.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.819
Everybody's
lost somebody.

25:19.819 --> 25:22.221
Everybody bangs around here.

25:22.221 --> 25:26.425
Shoot, we got our own war
on terror right here.

25:26.425 --> 25:28.494
(indistinct shouting,
ball bouncing in distance)

25:28.494 --> 25:29.996
MAN:
Hey! Hey!

25:29.996 --> 25:31.931
(phone ringing)

25:33.800 --> 25:36.636
What's up, Janila?

25:38.871 --> 25:40.807
What?!

25:42.675 --> 25:44.644
Okay. All right,
all right.

25:44.644 --> 25:45.645
All right.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.814
Repeat it slowly.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.153
Yeah, I think
you'd make an outstanding cop.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.554
Thank you, Janila.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.956
You're the best,
sweetheart.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.358
She wrote the license plate
number down on her hand.

25:59.358 --> 26:02.394
She just didn't want to say it
with the other girls around.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.697
Didn't want anyone
to know.
That makes sense.

26:04.697 --> 26:05.898
Mm.
Smart one, huh?

26:05.898 --> 26:08.668
Yeah.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.640
(barking in distance)

26:15.642 --> 26:17.777
(music playing)

26:19.178 --> 26:20.613
(loud barking)

26:20.613 --> 26:22.782
Uh, run

26:22.782 --> 26:24.583
the car first.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.452
Then call for backup.

26:26.452 --> 26:29.155
Unknown trouble calls
could be cop ambushes.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.624
(garbled radio transmission)

26:31.624 --> 26:32.992
(sighs)

26:32.992 --> 26:34.426
(dogs barking and howling)

26:34.426 --> 26:35.795
Okay.

26:37.396 --> 26:40.900
There he is:
Hector Munoz, aka Zig-Zag.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.569
This kid just got out
of prison two days ago.

26:43.569 --> 26:45.337
Droopy says they
been out doing ABGs.

26:45.337 --> 26:46.538
What?

26:46.538 --> 26:48.741
Anybody goes.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.743
Yeah, this is William 52.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.444
I'd like to put out
a citywide broadcast.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.547
Hector Munoz, age 18,
wanted for attempted murder.

26:55.547 --> 26:56.983
Considered armed
and dangerous.

26:56.983 --> 26:59.318
Vehicle's a '64
blue Impala.

26:59.318 --> 27:03.522
California license plate
number 2-Sam-Boy-Ida-6...

27:03.522 --> 27:05.257
5-3.

27:05.257 --> 27:08.995
Show us Code 6 George with
backup at 136th and Fletcher.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.997
Do you request an airship
at this time?

27:10.997 --> 27:13.700
Airship alert and on
standby, not overhead.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.904
(loud, booming music plays
in distance)

27:17.904 --> 27:19.438
(glass breaking, dog barking)

27:19.438 --> 27:20.707
We should call
SWAT in.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.008
This is not a SWAT callout.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.743
It's a bunch
of drunk cholos.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.878
Cuff first,
then search.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.548
(dogs barking)

27:29.548 --> 27:31.217
(gate squeaking)

27:36.088 --> 27:38.224
(dogs barking and howling)

27:48.667 --> 27:50.837
(glass breaking)

27:54.273 --> 27:56.642
(coughing)

27:56.642 --> 27:58.778
(loud barking)

28:01.714 --> 28:03.950
(loud rap music playing)

28:08.687 --> 28:10.456
(glass breaking)

28:10.456 --> 28:12.391
(barking continues)

28:20.566 --> 28:22.701
(loud rap music playing)

28:24.771 --> 28:27.073
(glass breaking)

28:28.474 --> 28:30.877
Stand up. Put your
hands in the air.

28:32.812 --> 28:33.880
Gun!

28:33.880 --> 28:35.181
CHICKIE:
Get down on your tummy.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.448
COOPER:
I will shoot you
through your head.

28:36.448 --> 28:37.683
CHICKIE:
Hands on the side.

28:37.683 --> 28:38.684
COOPER:
Put your hands
in the air now!

28:38.684 --> 28:40.887
(barking)

28:40.887 --> 28:42.721
(bottles clinking)

28:42.721 --> 28:43.790
Get down!

28:43.790 --> 28:44.757
Relax, fool.

28:44.757 --> 28:47.393
COOPER:
Hey, stay down.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.061
CHICKIE:
Get your hands
above your head.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.629
Relax, man.
You cuff him.
I got the gun.

28:50.629 --> 28:52.264
MAN:
No!
Shut up!

28:52.264 --> 28:55.367
(dogs barking,
loud rap music playing)

28:57.503 --> 28:59.005
(man grunts)

29:04.076 --> 29:05.511
Take him down
to the car now.

29:05.511 --> 29:07.146
No, I haven't finished
searching him yet, sir.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.314
What are you,
Generation Y?

29:08.314 --> 29:09.748
When I ask you
to do something,

29:09.748 --> 29:11.017
you do it!

29:11.017 --> 29:12.885
I'm your superior officer.

29:12.885 --> 29:15.021
(barking)

29:18.825 --> 29:20.626
(dogs barking and howling)

29:20.626 --> 29:21.828
Get your ass
down here.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.229
How you doing?

29:23.229 --> 29:24.063
I'm doing great.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.364
Huh? That's good,

29:25.364 --> 29:27.499
'cause you look
like a dead man to me.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.869
You just got temporary use
of your arms and legs.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.637
Shut the fuck up.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.039
Get him in the car now!

29:40.579 --> 29:41.747
COOPER:
Officer down.
Shots fired.

29:41.747 --> 29:43.049
Roll me an RA now!

29:43.049 --> 29:45.784
(dogs barking, siren blaring)

29:45.784 --> 29:47.519
Dewey?

29:47.519 --> 29:49.688
(groaning)
I got you.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.757
I got you. Look at me.
Look at me.

29:51.757 --> 29:53.893
Look at me.
I got you.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.429
(monitor beeping)

29:59.665 --> 30:03.635
(sniffling)

30:03.635 --> 30:04.904
(sighs)

30:04.904 --> 30:06.105
(sniffling)

30:06.105 --> 30:09.308
Listen, Miss Cole,
we know who did this.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.011
Who are they?

30:12.011 --> 30:14.313
Some kids in a gang.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.983
One of them got out
of prison two days ago.

30:16.983 --> 30:19.018
How can that be?

30:19.018 --> 30:21.787
My son's not affiliated.

30:21.787 --> 30:23.923
Henry never messed with that.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.459
Little kids running around
killing each other

30:27.459 --> 30:29.395
'cause they wear
the wrong colors,

30:29.395 --> 30:32.231
or they are the
wrong color.

30:32.231 --> 30:38.837
They need to
leave that alone.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.606
Yes, ma'am.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.476
Baby, go and see your brother.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.778
Go on, now.

30:46.778 --> 30:47.980
(sniffles)

30:57.924 --> 31:00.059
Henry?

31:00.059 --> 31:03.195
I don't hate you.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.234
ADAMS:
We need to band together
and try to bring

31:08.234 --> 31:09.635
this young lady home
to her family.

31:09.635 --> 31:10.869
Thank you, Detective.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.271
And that's the latest
from the scene.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.340
We're gonna send it back
to you in the studio.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.841
Hey, guys,
I need ten minutes.

31:15.841 --> 31:17.709
I'm gonna go home
and check on my mom.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.178
(siren chirps)

31:19.178 --> 31:23.950
Mr. Davis, we are gonna stay
on this as long as it takes.

31:23.950 --> 31:27.319
If you need anything,
give me a call.

31:27.319 --> 31:29.588
Okay?

31:29.588 --> 31:31.523
I'll be right back.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.062
(loud, indistinct shouting,
helicopter whirring)

31:44.036 --> 31:46.272
(loud, indistinct shouting)

31:48.274 --> 31:50.409
(helicopter whirring,
indistinct shouting)

31:51.643 --> 31:55.847
(women shouting)

31:55.847 --> 31:58.050
You okay, son?

32:00.019 --> 32:02.688
CAPTAIN:
You can't do that.

32:16.735 --> 32:18.637
Listen up.

32:24.977 --> 32:26.645
Sit down.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.581
Sit down.

32:34.553 --> 32:37.189
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

32:37.189 --> 32:39.525
Beverly Hills Gun Club?

32:39.525 --> 32:41.960
Why don't you shut
the hell up, sir?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.395
(chuckles)

32:44.963 --> 32:47.433
COOPER:
Right in his
ten-ring.

32:47.433 --> 32:48.967
Superb.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.603
(engine starting)

32:51.603 --> 32:53.405
(siren blaring)

32:53.405 --> 32:55.274
COOPER:
Burn squad
just showed up.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.243
You heard of Warner Brothers?

32:57.243 --> 32:58.744
This is "warn a brother."

32:58.744 --> 32:59.911
You don't lie.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.347
That's how
they get you.

33:01.347 --> 33:04.516
Lying is worse than an
out-of-policy shooting.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.018
You just tell it
like it happened,

33:06.018 --> 33:07.053
you'll be fine.

33:07.053 --> 33:08.520
No big deal.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.455
Taking a life

33:09.455 --> 33:10.989
is a big deal to me, okay?

33:10.989 --> 33:13.892
What the hell did you think
the gun was for, huh?

33:13.892 --> 33:15.127
Show-and-tell?

33:15.127 --> 33:16.962
Look, you'll
get over it.

33:16.962 --> 33:18.897
All right, they'll
send you to BSS.

33:18.897 --> 33:20.299
You'll do all that Buddhist

33:20.299 --> 33:22.668
"I love and revere
all sentient beings" crap.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.736
Then, at o'dark 30
next time you're up,

33:24.736 --> 33:26.638
you will drag
your weary, fried ass

33:26.638 --> 33:30.042
out of bed; you will put
on your gun and your vest,

33:30.042 --> 33:31.277
and you will do it
all over again.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.011
You know why?

33:33.011 --> 33:36.748
Because it's a front row seat
to the greatest show on earth.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.817
Can you abuse it?

33:38.817 --> 33:39.885
Yes, sir.

33:39.885 --> 33:41.587
You can,
and you will.

33:41.587 --> 33:42.821
I guarantee it.

33:42.821 --> 33:46.192
Because it is relentless,
and it gets to you,

33:46.192 --> 33:48.060
and it seems like
it changes nothing.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.928
But a day
like today--

33:49.928 --> 33:51.263
with some interesting capers

33:51.263 --> 33:53.432
and a few good arrests--
that's good.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.534
But every once
in a while,

33:55.534 --> 33:59.671
you get to take a bad guy
off the streets for good...

33:59.671 --> 34:02.274
and that, my friend,
is God's work.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.610
So, now, you want

34:04.610 --> 34:07.746
to be a pussy
and quit, you quit.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.148
You're a cop

34:09.148 --> 34:11.617
because you don't know
how not to be one.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.153
If you feel that way,
you're a cop.

34:14.153 --> 34:16.222
If you don't,
you're not.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.490
You decide.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.228
WOMAN:
Lydia?

34:22.228 --> 34:23.829
Yeah, Ma.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.131
Sorry.

34:25.131 --> 34:27.099
Want me to make you
something to eat?

34:27.999 --> 34:29.935
I'm not hungry.

34:29.935 --> 34:32.171
Go back to sleep.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.076
We have ants?

34:38.076 --> 34:40.112
There was a dead
cockroach.

34:40.112 --> 34:41.647
They were all
over it.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.115
I would have used
that spray,

34:43.115 --> 34:44.783
but you said
it was too toxic.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.852
All right, Ma.

34:50.456 --> 34:52.458
POLICE CHIEF (over speaker):
Yes, there has been a surge

34:52.458 --> 34:54.193
of gang violence
over the past few weeks.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.213
(hip hop music
playing in distance)

35:21.220 --> 35:23.355
(crickets chirping)

35:38.304 --> 35:39.705
(thump, thudding)

35:49.915 --> 35:52.150
(sighs)

36:01.227 --> 36:03.229
It's Arsham, right?

36:06.198 --> 36:08.800
(sobbing)

36:09.968 --> 36:11.303
I didn't want
to hurt her.

36:14.506 --> 36:17.108
(sobbing):
But, you know, just...

36:17.108 --> 36:19.110
she started screaming...

36:19.110 --> 36:22.180
and I panicked...

36:22.180 --> 36:25.050
so I put my hand over her mouth.

36:25.050 --> 36:27.185
(sobbing)

36:48.206 --> 36:49.875
(cuffs locking)

36:51.109 --> 36:52.578
(radio crackling)

36:52.578 --> 36:56.181
One King 54 requesting
assistance at my location.

36:56.181 --> 36:57.449
(radio crackling)

36:57.449 --> 36:59.418
I'm going in now.

37:01.787 --> 37:02.654
(sobbing)

37:02.654 --> 37:04.856
(garbled radio transmission)

37:21.039 --> 37:23.309
(sniffles, stops sobbing)

37:24.209 --> 37:25.577
(resumes sobbing)

37:42.093 --> 37:44.129
(gasping)

37:44.129 --> 37:45.397
Arsham!

37:45.397 --> 37:47.599
What did you do?

37:47.599 --> 37:50.802
(speaking Armenian)

37:50.802 --> 37:54.606
(Agata sobbing)

38:04.049 --> 38:06.284
Is he...
is he okay?

38:30.909 --> 38:32.944
(sighs)

38:40.352 --> 38:41.787
(baby crying softly in distance)

38:46.057 --> 38:47.626
I like that book.

38:47.626 --> 38:50.396
How come you read this book?

38:50.396 --> 38:51.963
My black studies class.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.699
For real?

39:00.406 --> 39:02.007
My brother got shot.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.174
What?

39:03.174 --> 39:05.110
My brother got shot.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.445
Oh, oh... I'm sorry.

39:06.445 --> 39:07.979
Is he going to be okay?

39:09.080 --> 39:10.549
They say so.

39:11.249 --> 39:12.851
Good... good.

39:15.253 --> 39:16.555
You need me to do anything?

39:16.555 --> 39:19.090
Can I check with anybody
about anything?

39:19.090 --> 39:20.291
Oh, no, he's fine.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.528
He's sleeping.

39:24.496 --> 39:26.498
You a cop?

39:31.002 --> 39:32.404
Yeah.

39:32.404 --> 39:33.839
Yeah.

39:35.273 --> 39:37.242
We got a look or something?

39:37.242 --> 39:38.610
No, it's just the hair.

39:38.610 --> 39:39.911
That's all.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.380
I don't look mean or anything?

39:43.248 --> 39:45.751
(chuckles)

40:00.799 --> 40:04.202
* Stay out super late tonight

40:04.202 --> 40:07.906
* Picking apples, making pie

40:07.906 --> 40:13.044
* Put a little something
in our lemonade *

40:13.044 --> 40:14.379
* And take it with us

40:14.379 --> 40:16.515
* We're half awake

40:16.515 --> 40:20.752
* In a fake empire

40:20.752 --> 40:23.054
* We're half awake

40:23.054 --> 40:26.458
* In a fake empire

40:29.661 --> 40:32.898
* Tiptoe through
our shiny city *

40:32.898 --> 40:36.367
* With our diamond slippers on

40:36.367 --> 40:39.905
* Do our gay ballet on ice

40:39.905 --> 40:42.440
* Bluebirds on our shoulders

40:42.440 --> 40:44.543
* We're half awake

40:44.543 --> 40:48.446
* In a fake empire

40:48.446 --> 40:51.416
* We're half awake

40:51.416 --> 40:55.020
* In a fake empire

40:57.288 --> 40:58.524
(sighs)

40:59.424 --> 41:01.459
WOMAN:
Lydia?

41:01.459 --> 41:02.928
Yeah, Ma.

41:04.262 --> 41:08.399
I left something at work,
and I had to go back.

41:08.399 --> 41:10.569
Go back to sleep, all right?

41:12.137 --> 41:13.939
It's early.

41:19.010 --> 41:22.113
* Turn the light out,
say good night *

41:22.113 --> 41:25.817
* No thinking
for a little while *

41:25.817 --> 41:29.387
* Let's not try to figure out

41:29.387 --> 41:32.691
* Everything at once

41:32.691 --> 41:36.394
* It's hard to keep track
of you *

41:36.394 --> 41:38.864
* Falling through the sky

41:38.864 --> 41:40.431
* We're half awake...

41:40.431 --> 41:43.168
I had the day
from hell.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.637
I got arrested.

41:45.637 --> 41:48.239
* We're half awake

41:48.239 --> 41:51.710
* In a fake empire

42:10.495 --> 42:12.831
I had a crap day, too.

42:16.134 --> 42:19.004
* Tiptoe through
our shiny city *

42:19.004 --> 42:22.307
* With our diamond slippers on

42:22.307 --> 42:25.877
* Do our gay ballet on ice

42:25.877 --> 42:28.647
* Bluebirds on our shoulders

42:28.647 --> 42:30.448
* We're half awake

42:30.448 --> 42:35.553
* In a fake empire

42:35.553 --> 42:37.689
* We're half awake

42:37.689 --> 42:41.593
* In a fake empire.

42:47.065 --> 42:48.700
COOPER:
It is my opinion

42:48.700 --> 42:50.301
that despite the circle jerk
of this night,

42:50.301 --> 42:52.503
Officer Ben Sherman
performed his duties

42:52.503 --> 42:54.372
to the highest standard.

42:54.372 --> 42:58.710
He is and will continue to be
a superior police officer.

42:58.710 --> 43:00.511
We will be very lucky
if he serves

43:00.511 --> 43:03.715
his sworn career
with the Los Angeles Police.
