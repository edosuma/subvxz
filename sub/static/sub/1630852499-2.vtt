- Chapter two.

00:08.214 --> 00:09.716
The Hayworth siblings
were settling in

00:09.816 --> 00:10.518
to their new normal.

00:10.618 --> 00:11.840
After being laid off,

00:11.940 --> 00:14.043
Sarah was trying
to make use of her time.

00:14.143 --> 00:16.367
Everyone hoped
she'd find a new job soon--

00:16.467 --> 00:18.210
some more than others.

00:18.310 --> 00:21.014
For Connor, being
a newly separated, single dad

00:21.114 --> 00:23.578
was exhausting.

00:23.678 --> 00:25.461
And thanks to that loan
from Connor,

00:25.561 --> 00:27.905
Tom had a financial cushion
for a few months,

00:28.005 --> 00:30.469
allowing him to really focus
on his novel.

00:30.569 --> 00:32.753
Asking for a loan was awkward.

00:32.853 --> 00:35.036
But it would get really ugly
once the whole family learned

00:35.136 --> 00:38.121
that this new book
was all about them.

a weekly rotating brunch.

- No, no.

trying to say

so probably not.

Next weekend,
we got Spags' wedding.

01:32.346 --> 01:34.170
- Do I have to call him Spags?

01:34.270 --> 01:35.652
- The siblings had grown up
across the street

01:35.752 --> 01:38.016
from a kid named Spags.

01:38.116 --> 01:40.059
While Tom tried to be
a role model to Connor,

01:40.159 --> 01:42.102
which usually meant doing
Connor's homework for him,

01:42.202 --> 01:43.624
Spags connected with Connor

01:43.724 --> 01:46.990
on a more primal level.

01:47.090 --> 01:48.672
Spags also had a crush
on Sarah,

01:48.772 --> 01:51.437
and although she hadn't
yet realized that she was gay,

01:51.537 --> 01:54.161
he probably helped her along
on that journey.

01:54.261 --> 01:56.044
Tom and Sarah never thought
he'd amount to much,

01:56.144 --> 01:59.770
but Spags had a ridiculous
idea called DrawerD'Oeuvres,

01:59.870 --> 02:01.412
and Connor invested in it,

02:01.512 --> 02:03.496
despite Tom saying
it was ridiculous.

02:03.596 --> 02:06.060
But, hey, what did Tom know?
Because it was a huge hit.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.624
And Connor added it to his
already ridiculous fortune

02:08.724 --> 02:10.827

invested in it, but didn't.
