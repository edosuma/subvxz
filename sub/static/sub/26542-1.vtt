18:42.788 --> 18:43.788
Ellie wait!

18:44.290 --> 18:46.018
Are you crazy? Do you know how
valuable this is?

18:46.042 --> 18:47.533
It was my grandfather's.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.046
[Lynn sighs]

18:51.756 --> 18:53.042
[music]

18:53.883 --> 18:57.126
I want to see surveillance tapes
for the past 24 hours.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.420
Get the make and model of the
victim's vehicle and

19:01.140 --> 19:03.598
get it on TV and radio. We need
every eyeball out there.

19:03.934 --> 19:04.934
Go!

19:06.979 --> 19:09.562

Bristol. Divorced.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.427
Her most recent address...

21:12.062 --> 21:14.099
Minersville. 30 miles north of
here.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.066
Stay here.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.567
Make sure these locals don't
destroy all the evidence.

[background radio banter]

21:23.991 --> 21:25.948
Do you want me to call ahead?

21:26.243 --> 21:27.243
No.

21:27.620 --> 21:31.113
This isn't the kind of news you
impart over the phone.

21:31.999 --> 21:32.999
[birds chirping]

21:34.168 --> 21:35.784
Elle, can you do the laundry?

21:36.837 --> 21:38.328
Elle, can you take out the
garbage?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.373
Elle, can you feed my cats?

[sighs]

21:44.929 --> 21:45.929
[musical stinger]

21:46.013 --> 21:47.013
Forget about me?

21:47.348 --> 21:48.008
What?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.307
It's the 3rd.

21:49.767 --> 21:50.883
[sigh] We didn't forget.

21:51.185 --> 21:53.928
We're a little short at the
moment. You'll get your money.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.642
You know, if money's a
problem...

21:57.107 --> 21:58.689
there's other ways we can settle
a tab.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.401
Right?

22:01.111 --> 22:02.111
Ugh! [disgusted]

22:03.239 --> 22:05.356
Fine. Now I want cash!

22:06.116 --> 22:07.116
Cash?

22:07.993 --> 22:09.234
I don't have it.

22:09.787 --> 22:10.903
Well go get it.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.904
I can't. I have things to do.

22:13.457 --> 22:16.416
How about you fix the washer
and dryer? Mow the lawn?

22:17.378 --> 22:18.710
I'm working on it.

22:19.713 --> 22:20.713

Ellie!

23:09.305 --> 23:10.546
Yeah?

23:10.931 --> 23:14.720
Hi. My parents wired me the
money... $400.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.509
I don't know if it shows how
much they love me or how much

23:18.606 --> 23:20.347
they don't want me back home.

23:20.858 --> 23:21.939
[sighs] I'm sure it's love.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.359
Lynn: Yeah right.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.111
So I'm meeting Carl for drinks.
You should come out.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.734

think I'm gonna tear it apart.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.418
Can I have it?

23:41.003 --> 23:41.368
Yeah...

23:41.670 --> 23:42.670

Ellie!

26:21.288 --> 26:22.288
You scared me.

26:22.372 --> 26:25.911
Oh, [laughs] I'm sorry. My trip
got cancelled. I forgot to call.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.293
No it's all right.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.830
Can I get you something to
drink?

26:29.379 --> 26:30.586
No thanks. I gotta get back.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.713
Ah, the recital tomorrow right?

26:33.008 --> 26:33.293
Yup.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.955
Well now that I'm home I can go.

26:35.219 --> 26:36.219
I'll be there front row.

26:36.637 --> 26:37.637

[Victoria] Ellie!

27:06.750 --> 27:08.616
Why are you walking this way?

27:08.919 --> 27:11.239
I told Mrs. Pritchett I'd feed
her cats while she was away.

27:13.507 --> 27:14.839
But I just saw her.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.125
[Ellie laughs] Yeah, I know.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.469
What about you?

27:18.720 --> 27:20.256
I always walk home this way.

27:20.639 --> 27:21.639
What about the bus?

27:21.849 --> 27:22.849
I hate the bus.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.151

28:26.496 --> 28:27.496
Victoria.

28:27.915 --> 28:28.955
[secretary] Just a moment.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.583

Would you like me to page him?

news. Where to begin?

29:11.875 --> 29:13.912
We have to approach this
delicately.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.294

29:15.545 --> 29:16.661
You wait here.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.474
Mrs. Bristol?

29:28.809 --> 29:29.219
Yes.

29:29.685 --> 29:30.971
Mrs. Katherine Bristol.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.681
You mean my daughter?

29:34.231 --> 29:35.231
May I speak with her?

29:37.359 --> 29:38.600
What's this about?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.403
Special Agent William Perkins.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.484
It's about her son, Martin.

29:46.076 --> 29:47.076
She's working.

29:48.537 --> 29:49.537
May I come in?

29:50.414 --> 29:52.155
[somber music]

29:54.543 --> 29:56.423
So, it's just you and your
daughter living here?

29:56.586 --> 29:57.997
What about Martin?

29:58.297 --> 29:59.657
[Meredith Bristol] What's going
on?

29:59.756 --> 30:01.036
We believe Martin is still
alive.

30:02.718 --> 30:05.506
And we believe he may try to
locate Katherine.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.805
Oh my God.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.215
[Meredith Bristol] This is some
sort of miracle!

30:10.684 --> 30:11.765
[breathing heavily]

30:13.061 --> 30:15.018
I need to speak with Katherine
in person.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.064
No. No. No.

30:17.274 --> 30:19.140
You don't understand. She's been
waiting

30:19.484 --> 30:21.350
10 years for this moment.

30:21.862 --> 30:22.862
It's complicated.

30:26.491 --> 30:27.823
What's going on?

30:28.243 --> 30:29.323
What aren't you telling me?

30:29.619 --> 30:31.235
We're here to keep you safe.

weird?

So you break into my house?

33:40.936 --> 33:41.936
The front door was open!

33:42.312 --> 33:43.553
I could have you arrested.

Aw, come on I love you.

You don't even know me.

Yeah, yeah I do! I know you.
Come on, wait up.

C'mon.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.114
I know you. [out of breath]

33:57.661 --> 33:59.653
I mean, I know you love your
music

34:00.413 --> 34:01.653
and I love classical music too.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.448
Name one classical composer?

34:19.224 --> 34:21.181
I got you something.

34:25.563 --> 34:26.600
They're real.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.230
I sold my Les Paul.

34:30.025 --> 34:31.025
It's beautiful.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.943
Why don't you give them to
Goldilocks?

34:37.324 --> 34:38.440
What? Are you crazy?

34:39.286 --> 34:40.606
Ellie come on. Don't be like
that.

Get lost!

35:47.270 --> 35:51.765
Kathy, there's some men here who
want to speak with you.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.104
They're from the FBI.

36:04.704 --> 36:07.788
[Agent Perkins] He was held
captive in a farmhouse

36:08.083 --> 36:09.790
outside Ironton Township.

36:10.126 --> 36:12.038
I always knew he was alive.
[sobbing]

36:12.337 --> 36:15.796
Martin was subjected to
unspeakable physical

36:16.091 --> 36:17.252
and mental abuse.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.048
You're his only connection to
the outside world.

36:22.639 --> 36:25.973
We believe he may try to locate
you.

36:26.309 --> 36:27.891
Well then I need to go home.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.395
You don't understand, this is
not a rational person.

36:31.690 --> 36:35.354
Your son is a killer. He's
extremely dangerous.

36:35.652 --> 36:37.143
I don't believe you.

36:38.446 --> 36:42.440
Your son tracked down and
murdered

36:42.867 --> 36:46.406
the only witnesses who could
identify him.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.405
That's what he was taught. How
to kill...

36:49.999 --> 36:51.865
and cover his tracks.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.956
I wouldn't be putting you
through this if I didn't

36:55.505 --> 36:57.497
believe that you might be in
danger.

36:58.007 --> 37:00.044
Martin needs me. He needs my
help.

37:00.510 --> 37:04.424
We have to find him first. Will
you help us?

[party music]

37:09.644 --> 37:11.385
Excuse me ladies.

37:11.813 --> 37:14.601
Hey, Laurie, can I get another
pitcher of beer?

37:16.609 --> 37:17.609
Hi!

37:17.777 --> 37:18.777
Hi!

37:22.657 --> 37:25.057
I can't believe you threw that
diamond bracelet in the trash.

37:25.201 --> 37:25.657
I did.

37:25.952 --> 37:26.952
Good for you.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.236
You should've called the cops.

37:28.538 --> 37:31.406
Whoa, called the cops? God, what
I'd miss?

37:31.958 --> 37:33.758
Simon, do you have any nice
friends for Ellie?

37:33.793 --> 37:34.829
She's on the rebound.

37:35.128 --> 37:36.128
That's okay.

37:36.296 --> 37:37.296
Yeah, what's your type?

37:37.589 --> 37:39.125
She's old fashioned.

37:39.424 --> 37:39.709
Oh yeah?

37:40.133 --> 37:40.543
Yeah.

37:40.967 --> 37:44.176
I like things like honesty,
respect, sensitivity...

37:44.846 --> 37:46.553
Mmm... she likes girls?

37:46.931 --> 37:47.931
Ahhh...

37:47.974 --> 37:52.139
Simon has a slight neurological
brain disorder known as small.

Scoot out, Hilda.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.072
Hi Carl!

38:04.199 --> 38:05.610
So did something happen with
John?

38:06.075 --> 38:08.909
Ellie caught him messing around
with Amanda Ryan.

38:09.204 --> 38:10.204
Amanda?

38:10.622 --> 38:12.158
[Simon] Well, she's a tramp.

38:12.791 --> 38:13.827
[Tara] Hey, it takes two!

38:14.125 --> 38:15.685
Well, if Amanda wants a guy for
herself,

38:15.752 --> 38:17.459
She knows how to screw things
up.

38:17.921 --> 38:18.921
Whatever.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.380
All right let me guess. She's
the one that told

38:21.674 --> 38:23.819
you all about it right? How he
came on to her and she tried

38:23.843 --> 38:25.584
to stop him and blah, blah, blah
right?

38:25.887 --> 38:26.887
So?

38:27.222 --> 38:28.383
[Simon] Did you believe her?

38:29.933 --> 38:31.925
Trust me, Amanda is a huge
skank.

38:32.602 --> 38:35.515
OK? So loose I'm surprised her
guts don't fall out.

38:36.105 --> 38:37.585
And how do you know so much
about her?

38:38.149 --> 38:40.812
She try to get with you? Aww,
c'mon.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.818
Listen, I know John. He's a good
guy.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.481
Maybe I was too hard on him.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.489
What? You only told him to drop
dead, never call you again

38:50.829 --> 38:52.949
and then you dumped the diamond
bracelet in the trash.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.871
You should talk to him.

Like what was he wearing? Was I
sure he didn't run away?

51:40.889 --> 51:44.007
The pain of knowing someone is
out there you love

51:45.227 --> 51:47.059
and you can't reach out to them

51:47.354 --> 51:49.721
to tell them how much you love
them.

51:50.065 --> 51:51.556
I guess you wouldn't understand.

51:52.943 --> 51:56.232
Before I joined the FBI I was in
the military.

51:57.239 --> 51:59.401
I was stationed overseas a lot.

52:01.827 --> 52:04.786
I saw pictures of my son being
born.

52:06.206 --> 52:08.046
I didn't get to hold him till he
was 2 and then

52:09.251 --> 52:10.708
only for a few months.

52:11.378 --> 52:12.539
[scoffs]

52:12.880 --> 52:16.590
Before I knew it he was a young
man, who never knew his dad,

52:16.925 --> 52:19.463
and by then didn't want to.

52:20.512 --> 52:21.512
Where is he now?

52:22.473 --> 52:23.473
Atlanta.

52:23.807 --> 52:25.298
I just haven't had a...

52:27.645 --> 52:30.433
I wouldn't know what to say to
him.

52:30.731 --> 52:31.731
[clears throat]

52:31.940 --> 52:34.683
All points have checked in. We
got nothing.

52:34.985 --> 52:36.476
Tell them to stay vigilant.

52:42.660 --> 52:44.868
[knocking on front door]

52:55.506 --> 52:56.872
[sighs]

52:59.968 --> 53:01.800
[knocking]

53:02.096 --> 53:03.096
[gasps]

53:06.141 --> 53:07.302
[Tara] Lynn?

53:07.726 --> 53:10.093
That's exactly what I mean,
right?

53:21.740 --> 53:23.823
Ha. Very funny!

53:24.576 --> 53:26.192
[crunch]

53:29.206 --> 53:32.119
[music swells]

53:39.675 --> 53:41.712
You guys need to get a life.

54:15.753 --> 54:17.244
You're letting me win.

54:17.713 --> 54:18.713
Maybe.

54:19.131 --> 54:21.043
You can't be that stupid.

54:24.928 --> 54:28.717
[sighs] This is boring. Let's
play hide and seek.

54:29.016 --> 54:30.016
Let's not.

54:30.184 --> 54:31.184
[phone rings]

54:33.103 --> 54:34.103
Hello.

54:34.563 --> 54:35.895
Have you heard from John yet?

54:36.523 --> 54:39.812
No, he's not answering his
phone. Why? What is it?

54:40.319 --> 54:42.060
Well his bike is on the side of
the house.

54:42.905 --> 54:44.612
What?! Are you sure?

54:45.073 --> 54:46.905
[Tara] Yeah, I just saw it.

54:47.534 --> 54:49.400
Everything OK over there?

54:49.787 --> 54:52.074
Yeah. I'm gonna stay here until
her Dad gets home.

54:52.372 --> 54:53.988
No sign of her Mom yet?

54:54.917 --> 54:55.917
[Ellie] No.

54:56.084 --> 54:58.371
OK well, let me know if you need
anything.

54:59.630 --> 55:02.088
[Ellie] I'm going to try calling
him again.

55:02.800 --> 55:05.133
[musical stinger]

55:08.388 --> 55:10.550
[ringing]

55:14.061 --> 55:15.177
[ringing]

55:16.188 --> 55:18.145
Are we gonna play or not?

55:19.107 --> 55:20.107
[ringing continues]

55:25.989 --> 55:28.026
[typing]

55:35.249 --> 55:38.242
[door creaks]

55:41.088 --> 55:47.210
Foucault did ask about
controlling society...

55:47.511 --> 55:48.511
via...

55:49.596 --> 55:51.633
knowledge and power.

55:56.228 --> 55:58.345
Tara you're a genius.

55:59.147 --> 56:00.147
[musical stinger] [gasp]

56:03.443 --> 56:04.775
[gasping, choking]

56:13.161 --> 56:14.527
Officer?

56:14.872 --> 56:15.872
Thank you.

56:18.083 --> 56:19.164
Agent Roland?

56:19.459 --> 56:21.041
Oh, no thank you.

56:21.420 --> 56:23.002
Do you mind if I smoke?

56:23.505 --> 56:24.791
No, not at all.

56:25.382 --> 56:27.339
My husband smoked until the day
he died.

56:28.260 --> 56:30.877
Of course, I had to light them
for him once

56:31.263 --> 56:32.799
they amputated his fingers.

56:33.599 --> 56:35.841
I had to hold his thing so he
wouldn't piss on himself

56:36.435 --> 56:37.926
when he went to the bathroom.

56:38.520 --> 56:40.557
He probably would have
complained if he still

56:40.939 --> 56:42.851
had his voice box.

56:44.985 --> 56:46.396
Who's this?

56:47.988 --> 56:49.274
My husband.

56:50.574 --> 56:51.574
Where is he now?

56:52.910 --> 56:54.617
He passed away, in an accident.

56:55.704 --> 56:56.704
I'm sorry.

56:57.205 --> 56:59.037
I couldn't afford the house so..

56:59.499 --> 57:01.161
we moved back here with my
mother.

57:01.793 --> 57:02.793
Moved? When?

57:03.462 --> 57:06.000
About three months before Martin
was taken.

57:06.590 --> 57:08.707
Where were you prior to this?

57:10.093 --> 57:11.334
New Hope.

57:13.347 --> 57:15.339
I need that address!

57:16.558 --> 57:17.558
[music intensifies]

57:23.231 --> 57:26.315
You're gonna kill him, aren't
you?

57:28.946 --> 57:30.983
Not if I don't have to.

57:33.575 --> 57:35.237
Agent Perkins!

57:36.244 --> 57:39.112
They found the van! Service road
off the interstate.

57:39.623 --> 57:40.623
Get in.

57:42.834 --> 57:45.247
Take me with you.

57:46.088 --> 57:48.626
Can't do that. You'll be safer
here.

57:49.800 --> 57:51.041
[car starts]

57:57.015 --> 58:00.099
New Hope is 10 miles north of
where the stolen van was found.

58:00.644 --> 58:03.887
He might have switched vehicles.
Get the local police on the line.

58:06.775 --> 58:09.893
[Lynn] I can't believe he lied
to me. A doctor!

58:10.237 --> 58:13.856
Yeah, right. He's taking one of
those night classes that

58:14.324 --> 58:15.940
you see in the Penny Saver.

58:16.284 --> 58:18.992
I don't know. Sarah told me.
[musical stinger]

58:20.747 --> 58:22.659
I know, she's an idiot!

58:23.250 --> 58:24.250
[crunch]

58:24.918 --> 58:28.252
Oh, and driving his Dad's car...
can you believe that?

58:29.423 --> 58:31.665
Ew and I let him kiss me.

58:32.592 --> 58:33.592
Ugh.

58:34.177 --> 58:36.635
Yeah, I guess it's Sarah's
revenge for when I set her

58:37.014 --> 58:38.255
up with that Korean guy.

58:38.598 --> 58:39.598
I know.

58:39.725 --> 58:41.136
Oh that bitch.

58:42.477 --> 58:43.477
OK.

58:43.645 --> 58:44.886
I'll talk to you later.

58:45.355 --> 58:46.355
Bye.

59:19.306 --> 59:21.218
But we didn't finish the game.

59:21.516 --> 59:23.473
I just have to check on
something.

[Ellie] Tara?

01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:11.980
Tara?

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:17.862
Can we go back and finish the
game?

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.902
Yeah, give me just a minute.

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.283
I'm thirsty.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:22.862
There's drinks in the fridge.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.335

01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:23.802
Yes.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.718
[Brooke] It's John's sister,
Brooke.

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:28.767
Hi.

01:01:29.144 --> 01:01:31.144
[Brooke] We've been trying to
reach John all night.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:33.308
He's not answering his phone.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.047
We were wondering if he was with
you.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.771
No. He was here but he left.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.101
[Brooke] He was pretty upset
when I talked to him earlier.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:42.988
You could say that!

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.748
[Brooke] Well, if you hear from
him can you tell

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.202
him to please call us?

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:49.747
Sure.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:51.207
Bye.

Boo! [laughs]

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:08.339
That's not funny.

01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:10.884
OK, now it's your turn to hide.

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:12.269
[sighs] Not now.

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:14.641
You said we could play.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:15.940
Yeah I know, but...

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:17.358
Come on.

01:02:17.943 --> 01:02:18.943
OK. You hide.

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:20.734
OK. Count to ten.

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:23.149
