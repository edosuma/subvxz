WEBVTT

00:09.357 --> 00:11.054
Hey.

00:11.098 --> 00:13.970
If we have to listen,
you have to listen.

00:15.972 --> 00:18.061
Oh.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.023
Well, I just loved it, Emme.

00:23.066 --> 00:25.764
I loved it, too. I don't think
I'll ever forget it.

00:25.808 --> 00:27.549
I can't wait for my recital.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.943
It's a two-hour concert, Adam.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.858
What if she's the best one?

00:32.902 --> 00:36.036
Uh, we'll boo.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.602
Other people's kids need
to know the truth.

00:38.821 --> 00:41.345
Oh, hey, Katie,
by the way,

00:41.389 --> 00:43.043
there's a new
Godzilla movie out.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.870
What?

00:44.914 --> 00:47.003
I said there's
a new Godzilla movie out.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.831
We've been to every one.
You want to go this weekend?

00:48.874 --> 00:50.833
Thanks, but I'm okay.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.010
Well, I know you're okay,

00:54.054 --> 00:55.838
I was just wondering
if you want to see a movie.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.622
What?

00:58.667 --> 01:00.060
Never mind.

01:03.933 --> 01:06.240
"I'm okay"?
What the heck is "I'm okay"?

01:06.283 --> 01:08.242
"I'm okay"
is a nice way of saying,

01:08.285 --> 01:12.159
"I'd rather do nothing alone
than something with you."

01:12.202 --> 01:15.466
She used to love doing stuff
with me.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.468
Well, I'll see
the movie with you.

01:17.512 --> 01:20.993
Eh, thanks, but I'm okay.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.995
Honey, don't take it
personally, all right?

01:23.039 --> 01:25.781
Maybe she doesn't like
Godzilla movies anymore.

01:25.824 --> 01:29.176
Andi, everybody likes Godzilla.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.003
Not me. I-I don't get it.

01:31.047 --> 01:34.181
I-Is he a dinosaur, a-a dragon?

01:34.224 --> 01:37.401
Maybe he destroys cities 'cause
he doesn't know what he is.

01:37.445 --> 01:41.144
He was created
by an atomic explosion.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.103
See, the radiation--
Y-You know what?

01:43.146 --> 01:44.887
I'm not explaining it
to you again.

01:46.323 --> 01:49.021
Look, honey, Kate's
getting older.

01:49.065 --> 01:51.023
Okay? You're the parent.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.983
It's your job to figure out
how to connect with her.

01:54.026 --> 01:56.072
Yeah, I just need to find
something we have in common.

01:56.116 --> 02:00.076
Used to be Godzilla,
now I have no idea.

02:01.251 --> 02:02.905
Planet of the Apes,maybe?Eh...

02:04.950 --> 02:07.518
Hey, Dad, can you drop me at
the mall after school tomorrow?

02:12.393 --> 02:13.916
N-No problem.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.831
I am always here for you.

02:15.874 --> 02:18.790
Hey, how about
a hug? Huh? Aww.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.923
Huh...?

02:22.185 --> 02:23.795
That was no hug.

02:23.839 --> 02:27.103
It's like she bumped into me
by accident.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.497
Yeah, the good hug
days are over.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.846
If it makes you feel any better,

02:30.889 --> 02:32.369
I don't get them
anymore, either.

02:32.413 --> 02:35.546
You know what? It does not
make me feel any better.

02:37.766 --> 02:40.290
You're not gonna believe
this. I won the lottery.

02:40.334 --> 02:43.119
Oh, my God. How much?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.816
The barbecue ribs lottery.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.775
Oh, my God. How much?

02:46.818 --> 02:48.124
What is a ribs lottery?

02:48.168 --> 02:51.345
I-It's for Frank's
Underground Barbecue.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.738
He's a backyard chef
who randomly texts people

02:53.782 --> 02:55.914
from his list when
a new batch of ribs is ready--

02:55.958 --> 02:57.655
if you're not gonna know
about Godzilla,

02:57.699 --> 03:00.528
at least know about Frank.

03:00.571 --> 03:03.400
Oh. This is the perfect way
to connect with Katie.

03:03.444 --> 03:04.619
She loves ribs.

03:04.662 --> 03:05.924
Yeah, you know,
when she was little,

03:05.968 --> 03:07.709
I used to take her
for barbecue on my motorcycle.

03:07.752 --> 03:10.886
You put my baby on the
back of your motorcycle?

03:10.929 --> 03:12.496
Come pick them up with me.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.324
We can put the ribs
in Emme's old car seat.

03:14.368 --> 03:15.630
Safety first.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.461
Ooh.Whoa...

03:20.504 --> 03:22.680
Check out those ribs, Andi.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.639
You know, you look at cows,
and they're kind of ugly,

03:24.682 --> 03:26.031
but when you chop them up
into little pieces,

03:26.075 --> 03:27.816
they're beautiful.ADAM :
Yeah.

03:27.859 --> 03:30.645
You know, we almost didn't
find Frank's Barbecue.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.342
We had to follow the smoke
in the sky,

03:32.386 --> 03:33.952
like when they choose
a new pope.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.258
Yeah.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.869
Katie, look,
I got all your favorites.

03:37.913 --> 03:41.090
Ribs, mac and cheese,
pork and beans.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.875
Actually, I'm a vegan now.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.922
What?

03:46.965 --> 03:49.881
I'm a vegan.
I don't eat meat anymore.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.057
Why?

03:52.101 --> 03:53.363
Wait,

03:53.407 --> 03:54.712
we can do that?

03:54.756 --> 03:55.974
You always say we have
to eat whatever Mom makes,

03:56.018 --> 03:57.541
even if it's gross.

03:57.585 --> 04:00.718
Like her Andi Patties.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.417
Why won't you tell us
what's in them?

04:03.460 --> 04:06.376
Because I want you to eat them.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.596
So you're a vegan now, huh?

04:08.639 --> 04:10.206
Good for you.
I call Kate's ribs.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.426
Oh, no, no, no.

04:12.469 --> 04:15.777
Look, honey, we don't allow
vegans in this house.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.083
Okay? When you're older,
and you build a house

04:18.127 --> 04:21.173
with yourbare hands,
you can let vegans in it.

04:21.217 --> 04:22.784
You didn't build this house.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.699
I installed the icemaker.

04:25.743 --> 04:28.006
Adam,

04:28.050 --> 04:31.009
what I'm hearing is that Kate
has a new interest,

04:31.053 --> 04:34.012
which you might be interested in
connecting to.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.231
I can't connect to that.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.452
She eats plants.

04:38.495 --> 04:41.193
I eat food you have to hunt.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.413
It's a cow, Adam.

04:43.457 --> 04:47.069
I didn't say it was hard.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.603
So is vegan like vegetarian?

04:59.647 --> 05:01.388
Uh, what things can't you eat?

05:01.431 --> 05:05.566
Well, there's meat, fish,
cheese, milk, butter.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.263
But those are all the things.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.440
They showed us a documentary
about it at school,

05:10.484 --> 05:12.964
and if you guys could've seen
the faces on those animals,

05:13.008 --> 05:14.749
you'd agree with me.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.447
This is a terrible idea.
Think of your mother.

05:17.491 --> 05:20.102
She's gonna have to cook two
different dinners every night.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.625
Well, you could cook one.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.889
I am on your side, here.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.936
Don, help me out?

05:27.979 --> 05:29.503
No can do.
The ribs are kicking in.

05:29.546 --> 05:30.721
Time to take a meat nap.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.942
Mom,

05:33.985 --> 05:35.987
Emme and I decided
to only eat cake now.

05:36.031 --> 05:39.034
If Kate gets to go vegan,
than we get to go caken.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.604
Well, my Andi Patties could be
made of cake. You don't know.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.606
I think they're made of ear wax.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.434
Okay, go upstairs, please.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.133
You see?

05:51.176 --> 05:54.919
Your vegan kick has started
a house-wide rebellion.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.007
If you'd just watch the
documentary with me,

05:56.051 --> 05:57.313
you'd get it.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.010
Look, I brought home a copy.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.885
"Apocalypse Cow"?

06:06.104 --> 06:07.976
Thanks, but I'm okay.

06:08.019 --> 06:10.631
This is your chance
to connect with her.

06:10.674 --> 06:12.850
Yeah, well,
I don't agree with her,

06:12.894 --> 06:14.852
I am top of the food chain.

06:14.896 --> 06:18.073
When a cow installs an icemaker,
I will stop eating it.

06:18.116 --> 06:22.120
You don't have to really be
interested, you just fake it.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.906
Like, like, I do when Teddy
tells me about his video games.

06:24.949 --> 06:27.430
"Mom, I zapped a space trooper."

06:27.474 --> 06:30.520
"That's great honey." Hug.

06:30.564 --> 06:34.045
You think if I watch that movie
with Katie, she'll hug me?

06:34.089 --> 06:35.917
She might go full koala.

06:37.658 --> 06:40.704
All right, I'll try it.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.926
Remember when the kids were
all over us all the time?

06:46.754 --> 06:48.582
Maybe we should
have another baby.
Really?

06:51.323 --> 06:54.849
No, no, I'll try this.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.025
Before we start,
I just want you to know

06:57.068 --> 06:59.070
it means a lot
that you'll watch this with me.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.464
Hey, I like spending time
with you.

07:01.508 --> 07:04.336
But this movie is not
gonna change how I feel.

07:04.380 --> 07:07.470
I know how the sausage is made,
and it's delicious.

07:09.994 --> 07:13.737
: I did not know
how the sausage was made.

07:13.781 --> 07:16.958
And why'd they name the
chickens after famous people?

07:17.001 --> 07:19.395
That just made us sadder
when they got eaten.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.354
Poor Anne Hatch-away.

07:22.398 --> 07:24.966
And what about her
husband, Eggy Van Halen?

07:25.009 --> 07:29.536
He's heartbroken,
she was the one.

07:29.579 --> 07:33.191
I can't believe I'm saying
this, but I'm done with meat.

07:33.235 --> 07:36.020
What?
I mean it, Katie.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.457
I'm going vegan with you.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.545
Really?

07:38.588 --> 07:40.416
I love you, Dad.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.549
I love you, honey.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.420
Oh, oh, are we done? Okay.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.423
Hey, I'll get Mom to do it, too.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.251
You're the best.

07:55.083 --> 07:58.260
Brace yourself.
I've got big news.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.392
Katie hugged me.

08:00.436 --> 08:02.482
Aww, that's great.

08:02.525 --> 08:05.180
And all you had to do
was fake some interest.

08:05.223 --> 08:06.703
Parenting's easy.

08:06.747 --> 08:09.358
That's the other thing.
I'm not faking.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.099
I am going vegan.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.970
Yeah, right.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.537
I am.

08:14.581 --> 08:17.540
Oh, also, I told her
you'd do it too.What?

08:17.584 --> 08:20.021
It bought me another hug,
I'm not sorry.

08:20.064 --> 08:22.284
What-- s-so now if I don't
do it, I look like a jerk.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.373
All you had to do was fake it.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.115
I couldn't.
The movie was too powerful.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.509
There was this cow,
his name was Paul MooCartney--

08:29.552 --> 08:32.512
and... and do you know
what veal is?

08:32.555 --> 08:35.732
How can we be Parmesan-ing
those little guys?

08:35.776 --> 08:37.995
So Kate really hugged you?

08:38.039 --> 08:39.388
Yeah, like this.

08:40.737 --> 08:44.393
Oh. Wow.:
Yeah.

08:44.436 --> 08:47.570
Last time I got a hug like that,
I had to buy her a phone.

08:47.614 --> 08:50.094
But even then she hugged
the phone tighter.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.357
Okay, I'll do it.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.968
Oh, this is gonna be so great.

08:54.011 --> 08:56.318
We'll be healthier,
happier and huggier.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.320
Okay, but-but, hey,
I just, I need to know

08:58.363 --> 09:00.365
that you're really committed.Well...

09:00.409 --> 09:01.410
Don't you remember
when you promised

09:01.453 --> 09:02.890
to do couples yoga with me?

09:02.933 --> 09:04.108
You didn't even make it
through one class.

09:04.152 --> 09:07.285
That lady touched my rear end.

09:07.329 --> 09:10.637
She was the instructor,
and she was adjusting your pose.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.074
She made it halfway
to third base, Andi.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.250
But this isn't like that.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.339
I promise, I am fully committed.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.254
Okay.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.864
Okay.
Wait.

09:20.908 --> 09:24.302
You do know that going vegan
means no more McNuggets, right?

09:26.348 --> 09:28.132
I hadn't thought of that.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.308
I can do it.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.271
So here's what we've prepared
for your first vegan experience.

09:36.314 --> 09:39.274
Yeah. These nuggets
are made of tofu,

09:39.317 --> 09:41.711
so they're chick-none nuggets.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.235
Okay? They taste just
like chicken, but wet.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.282
Eat it like an oyster.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.850
And this is macaroni
and cashew cheese.

09:49.893 --> 09:53.636
Yeah, all the fun of cashews,
but in a paste.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.857
So you're trying
to feed me nut cheese?

09:56.900 --> 09:59.337
Look, I know
it's a big adjustment,

09:59.381 --> 10:01.296
but there is an upside.

10:01.339 --> 10:04.516
We get to act superior by
telling everybody we're vegan.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.171
And we're saving
animals' lives.

10:07.215 --> 10:09.347
Yeah, that, too.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.306
Yeah, and we had
a vegan breakfast.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.656
Bathroom-wise,
it's much more efficient.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.571
Okay, first bite
starts the clock,

10:15.615 --> 10:17.399
so I don't recommend
eating in the car.

10:17.442 --> 10:20.228
Bon appétit, everyone.

10:23.579 --> 10:24.928
Don!

10:24.972 --> 10:26.321
It was a primitive
instinct.

10:26.364 --> 10:29.890
I ate poison and
my body rejected it.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.327
All right, well,
that-that-that's okay.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.894
It takes a little
getting used to,

10:33.937 --> 10:35.330
but it's for the animals.
Right, Katie?

10:35.373 --> 10:37.332
That's right, Dad.

10:37.375 --> 10:40.378
This is even worse
than Andi Patties.

10:41.205 --> 10:45.122
Yeah, it tastes like
an Andi Patty's butt.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.559
Enough of this
beatnik nonsense.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.387
Don, get those ribs
out of the fridge.

10:49.431 --> 10:52.564
Dad, we don't eat that anymore.

10:52.608 --> 10:55.655
I didn't spend the Christmas
of '66 dodging bullets

10:55.698 --> 10:58.222
in a rice paddy
to eat snot nuggets.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.748
You have to decide right now,

11:01.791 --> 11:03.837
are you a vegan or an American?

11:03.880 --> 11:06.622
You're missing the point.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.233
Those ribs came
from an innocent cow.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.366
Cows are designed
to be eaten.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.455
They're made of
steak and cheese.

11:13.498 --> 11:18.329
You know what? You two are
a bad influence, so these ribs

11:18.373 --> 11:20.288
are going where
they belong,

11:20.331 --> 11:22.246
in the trash.I'm proud of you, honey.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.508
Thank you.

11:23.552 --> 11:27.034
Now, who wants a soy-glazed
mushroom cutlet?

11:27.077 --> 11:29.079
Donny, you know
what to do.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.125
I'm one step ahead of you, Pop.

11:34.911 --> 11:37.522
You think the trash
is gonna scare me?

11:37.566 --> 11:39.699
In the service,
they called me The Raccoon.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.754
Okay, okay, sweetie.
So beautiful.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.887
Um, why don't you

11:53.930 --> 11:55.279
go get dressed for your recital?

11:55.323 --> 11:57.325
I'm not going too fancy.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.936
I'll let my music
speak for itself.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.112
Never lose that
confidence, sweetie.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.771
Ugh. What?

12:08.815 --> 12:11.469
Oh, who leaves a half-eaten
Slim Jim in their backpack?

12:11.513 --> 12:13.558
It's all covered with lint

12:13.602 --> 12:17.867
and hair and... deliciousness.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.216
ADAM:
Andi!

12:20.435 --> 12:21.784
Put down that Slim Jim.

12:21.828 --> 12:25.179
Too late.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.484
It wasn't too late.

12:26.528 --> 12:29.183
You saw me and then you ate it.

12:29.226 --> 12:31.794
And now it's too late.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.405
Just don't tell
Kate, okay?

12:34.449 --> 12:36.973
This vegan thing
is working for me, too.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.496
This morning,
she took out an earbud

12:38.540 --> 12:42.892
and voluntarily spoke to me.
She... she said,

12:42.936 --> 12:45.460
"Can I have ten dollars?"

12:45.503 --> 12:47.636
I'm not gonna tell Katie

12:47.679 --> 12:50.813
because I enjoy having
the moral high ground.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.903
The view's nice,
I've never been up here before.

12:53.947 --> 12:56.732
Hey, Mom, thank you so much

12:56.776 --> 12:58.821
for buying me those
strawberry snack bars.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.431
Oh, honey, you're welcome.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.869
No, seriously, it means a lot
that you support my choices.

13:02.912 --> 13:05.349
Aw.

13:07.351 --> 13:09.136
Your mom ate a Slim Jim.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.880
What?
Yeah.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.665
She barely chewed it,
she was like a seal with a fish.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.755
Oh, Mom.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.365
Your mother's betrayal
must be very hard for you.

13:21.409 --> 13:22.497
Come on, let's hug it out.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.891
Well, I'm not that upset.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.370
No, no, it's for your own good.

13:36.554 --> 13:39.122
Okay, Don's all set up
in the back

13:39.166 --> 13:40.776
to record
Emme's recital.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.778
He's so tall, no one
can block him.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.086
He's like a giraffe
with a camera.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.915
Don't act like
everything's fine.

13:48.958 --> 13:51.395
You sold me out to Kate.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.180
I had to.

13:53.223 --> 13:56.096
There's only a limited amount of
hugs until she goes to college.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.793
I'm getting
as many as I can.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.360
What about me?

13:59.403 --> 14:01.971
You're fine, the
breastfeeding years

14:02.015 --> 14:05.018
were like one
long hug for you.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.063
It's my time.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.674
BOTH:
Hi.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.328
Yes, we're arguing,

14:11.372 --> 14:14.636
but life is complicated
for us because we're vegan.

14:14.679 --> 14:17.247
Yeah, that's right,
full-blown vegan.

14:17.291 --> 14:21.730
Well, some of us are.
She cheated on me.

14:21.773 --> 14:24.037
With jerky.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.647
And I am back
on the wagon.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.736
Yeah, I made a chicken
for Teddy and Emme today,

14:27.779 --> 14:29.085
I wasn't even tempted.

14:29.129 --> 14:32.175
I saved the gizzards
for Andi Patties.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.962
ANNOUNCER:
Next up, Emme Burns.

14:36.005 --> 14:39.356
Oh, there she is.
That's our daughter.

14:43.970 --> 14:47.147
She's not a vegan.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.542
This is a great gig.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.109
I just made 40 bucks
charging short moms

14:53.153 --> 14:54.719
to videotape
their kids.

14:54.763 --> 14:58.375
Don, this is
my kid's school.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.073
I should get half.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.990
Ugh. Look at this.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.949
I finally get picked for Frank's
barbecue and I can't have it.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.603
It's like when my
high school teacher

15:08.646 --> 15:10.866
hit on me after
I was married.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.999
Ah, Miss Popovich.
She made algebra sexy.

15:13.042 --> 15:16.567
I wore a tank top
for four years, nothing.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.919
Married six months,
here she comes.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.790
I'll just text
and say I don't want the ribs.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.096
Whoa, don't do that.
I'll take them.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.836
Well, if you want them,
go get them yourself.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.577
I can't, they
check your ID.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.231
Ugh.
Come on, you owe me.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.364
You threw my ribs in the
garbage. I didn't get any.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.105
Raccoons don't share.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.804
Okay, fine, I'll go,

15:35.847 --> 15:37.371
but Andi can never know.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.025
I snitched on her
for sneaking jerky

15:39.068 --> 15:40.287
and she's looking
for revenge.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.158
You guys have
a weird marriage.

15:42.202 --> 15:46.032
Will you please?Okay, I'll cover for you.

15:46.075 --> 15:50.079
Okay, just, uh, oh, tell Andi
I went home to use the bathroom.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.341
I'm a vegan,
she'll believe it.

15:54.257 --> 15:58.087
Okay, Emme went to
a sleepover. Where's Adam?

15:58.131 --> 16:00.089
Oh, he was having
vegan problems,

16:00.133 --> 16:01.699
so he went home
to use the bathroom.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.701
Why wouldn't he use
the bathroom here?

16:03.745 --> 16:08.010
Well, because he wanted
to stop on the way

16:08.054 --> 16:10.491
and get Emme flowers

16:10.534 --> 16:13.102
because the recital
was so good.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.974
Okay, now I know you're lying.

16:15.017 --> 16:17.063
Where is he?

16:17.106 --> 16:20.066
Fine, he's sleeping
with his high school teacher.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.719
Don.

16:21.763 --> 16:25.071
Okay, okay, he won
the barbecue lottery.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.637
He went to pick up the ribs.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.118
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.120
Mister Holier-Than-Thou
is getting ribs

16:31.164 --> 16:32.992
while-while
I'm an outcast

16:33.035 --> 16:36.082
for eating a hairy,
backpack Slim Jim?

16:36.125 --> 16:39.172
He's not getting them for
himself, he's giving them to me.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.869
Come on, Don,
we both know better.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.436
He can't resist
barbecue.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.873
His first time alone
in the car with those ribs

16:44.916 --> 16:47.615
will be like his first time
alone in a car with me.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.225
Lots of grabbing,
heavy breathing,

16:49.269 --> 16:51.184
and windows
steaming up.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.273
He's not doing that
to my ribs.
Let's go.

16:59.105 --> 17:02.760
ADAM: Smell good all you want,
I'm taking you to Don's.

17:02.804 --> 17:06.982
I'm doing this for Katie
and Anne Hatch-away,

17:07.026 --> 17:11.117
and Veal Patrick Harris.

17:11.160 --> 17:15.295
Aw, who am I kidding?
I can't control myself.

17:15.338 --> 17:18.341
This is just like my first time alone in the car with Andi.

17:18.385 --> 17:22.128
I'm sorry, Katie.

17:22.171 --> 17:26.349
I saw his truck.
He's here with those ribs.

17:26.393 --> 17:29.309
I smell it.
The meat is near.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.621
Good boy, Don,
good boy.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.372
Classic meat nap.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.244
Look how happy he is.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.246
I'm going
to get the hose.

17:53.289 --> 17:56.510
Wait, Andi, let's remember
what's important here.

17:58.555 --> 18:01.297
Okay, let him have it.

18:01.341 --> 18:05.301
Okay, I'm sorry I ate the ribs.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.651
Lay it on me, I deserve it.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.827
No, you know what?
This makes sense

18:09.871 --> 18:11.655
'cause for a couple hours today
I was thinking

18:11.699 --> 18:13.701
you were better than me,
and then I was like,

18:13.744 --> 18:16.225
"Well, that can't be right."
And look, it's not.

18:16.269 --> 18:19.924
The thing is,
I can't be a vegan.

18:19.968 --> 18:24.364
It's like asking Godzilla
not to stomp on Tokyo.

18:24.407 --> 18:27.497
He has to do it, it's who he is.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.239
You gonna tell Kate?

18:30.283 --> 18:33.199
Well, yeah, I can't
let her hug a lie.

18:33.242 --> 18:36.245
She deserves the truth.
I'll-I'll go tell her now.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.378
Hey, maybe bring her

18:38.421 --> 18:41.163
one of those strawberry
snack bars to soften her up.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.469
Got me a hug.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.519
Katie?
I'm sorry.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.391
I saw chicken in the fridge
and I couldn't resist.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.915
I love meat too much.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.525
So do I!

18:55.569 --> 18:58.398
I just ate a half a cow.

18:58.441 --> 19:02.228
Really? That makes me feel
so much better.

19:02.271 --> 19:05.970
Oh, and this hug is even nicer

19:06.014 --> 19:08.277
because we both smell like meat.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.586
Nah!

19:14.631 --> 19:15.893
Ah...

19:21.899 --> 19:23.249
Ah, that was
some good chicken.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.598
Mm.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.730
Anne Hatch-away and her
finger-licking friends

19:26.774 --> 19:28.210
went out in a blaze of glory.

19:28.254 --> 19:32.345
And we put out that blaze
with honey mustard.

19:32.388 --> 19:35.174
Yeah.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.611
I do feel kind of bad
for giving up, though.

19:37.654 --> 19:41.919
Hey, how about this?

19:41.963 --> 19:43.399
We'll keep eating meat,

19:43.443 --> 19:45.967
but we'll donate
to the animal rights people.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.229
Really?

19:47.273 --> 19:49.100
Yeah. We'll do whatever we want,

19:49.144 --> 19:50.667
but we'll give a little money

19:50.711 --> 19:54.236
to the people
who do the right thing. Yeah?

19:54.280 --> 19:58.284
And that is how
you get around that.
