WEBVTT

00:08.843 --> 00:10.469
Okay, next.

00:11.303 --> 00:12.554
What is...

00:13.472 --> 00:14.389
This?

00:16.141 --> 00:17.476
That is...

00:17.518 --> 00:18.519
Disgusting.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.814
It's a human liver.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.190
Which is disgusting.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.277
- Okay, next we got...

00:27.319 --> 00:28.570
One sec.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.405
Hey, we're studying.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.282
Do you want to fail

00:30.447 --> 00:32.282
your biology test?

00:32.324 --> 00:34.242
Wait, you got to see

00:32.324 --> 00:34.242
this new reality show.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.661
It's called,

00:35.703 --> 00:37.955
"Celebrities in elevators

00:35.703 --> 00:37.955
talking about breakfast."

00:37.997 --> 00:39.122
Ugh.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.502
This morning I had egg whites,

00:43.544 --> 00:45.044
two bites of a banana,

00:45.420 --> 00:46.547
and I had some--

00:46.588 --> 00:48.089
- Hey, hey,

00:46.588 --> 00:48.089
I'm going to let you finish,

00:48.131 --> 00:50.676
but right now I want to say

00:48.131 --> 00:50.676
I had pancakes for breakfast.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.636
I'm a genius.

00:54.513 --> 00:57.057
Okay, television isn't

00:54.513 --> 00:57.057
even trying anymore.

00:58.893 --> 01:02.021
Hey guys, did you hear?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.522
Did you guys

01:02.062 --> 01:03.522
watch the news tonight?

01:03.939 --> 01:05.900
Why would we watch the news?

01:05.941 --> 01:07.359
Do we look 40 years old?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.738
The Wall Dogs

01:08.318 --> 01:10.738
hit the Swellview Library.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.948
- Really?

01:10.779 --> 01:12.948
- There's a swellview library?

01:12.990 --> 01:14.033
Yeah.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.368
Aw. They shouldn't

01:14.199 --> 01:16.368
spray paint a library.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.536
Well, don't worry,

01:17.578 --> 01:18.871
the cops are going

01:17.578 --> 01:18.871
to catch them now.

01:19.872 --> 01:20.581
(Jasper)

01:19.872 --> 01:20.581
Look.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.209
<i>Hey, taggers, you're it.</i>

01:24.251 --> 01:25.711
<i>That's right, Trent.</i>

01:25.753 --> 01:28.338
<i>Last night, the graffiti gang</i>

01:30.674 --> 01:32.634

01:32.676 --> 01:33.969
<i>This is the ninth time</i>

01:34.011 --> 01:35.345

01:46.815 --> 01:48.567
<i>"true dat?"</i>

01:48.609 --> 01:49.777
(laughs)

01:51.070 --> 01:51.987
Did you hear that?

01:52.529 --> 01:54.155
If we find the Wall Dogs

01:54.197 --> 01:56.450
we'll get 10,000 bucks.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.328
- Eh...

01:58.326 --> 02:00.328
- I don't know.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.330
Come on, I need the money.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.123
For what?

02:04.207 --> 02:06.251
I want to get

02:04.207 --> 02:06.251
foot reduction surgery.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.671
Dude, there's nothing wrong

02:07.669 --> 02:09.671
with having huge feet.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.006
Yeah there is.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.466
They hurt when I jog.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.301
They give me back problems.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.177
And sometimes

02:14.342 --> 02:16.177
when I talk to people,

02:17.178 --> 02:18.555
I catch them staring down.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.849
When do you ever jog?

02:20.891 --> 02:22.059
Yeah, I've never seen you jog.

02:23.602 --> 02:24.812
Whatever.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.396
Come on.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.523
Let's form a posse so we can

02:26.438 --> 02:28.523
catch those Wall Dogs

02:28.565 --> 02:30.150
and get the reward money.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.443
Uh...

02:31.485 --> 02:32.527
Nope.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.527
No.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.238
Just think about it.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.240
Because I really think

02:35.280 --> 02:37.240
that we could...

02:40.368 --> 02:41.244
Charlotte?

02:41.286 --> 02:42.663
Yeah?

02:43.371 --> 02:44.873
My eyes are up here.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.962
It all just kind of happened.

02:50.004 --> 02:52.006
My dad was

02:50.004 --> 02:52.006
an irresponsible scientist.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.508
I wanted an after-school job.

02:54.549 --> 02:57.052
(Captain Man)

02:54.549 --> 02:57.052
And by accident,

02:54.549 --> 02:57.052
he made me indestructible.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.428
Ah!

02:58.470 --> 03:00.472
(Henry)

02:58.470 --> 03:00.472
I went into this crazy store

03:00.931 --> 03:02.724
and met

03:00.931 --> 03:02.724
a pretty interesting guy.

03:02.766 --> 03:03.809
I'm going to blow your mind.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.895
(Captain Man)

03:04.685 --> 03:06.895
Now I protect

03:04.685 --> 03:06.895
the good citizens of Swellview

03:06.937 --> 03:07.896
who call me...

03:07.938 --> 03:09.023
(Henry)

03:07.938 --> 03:09.023
And he turned out to be...

03:09.064 --> 03:10.983
Captain Man!now the name.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.776
That's right, Henry.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.903
(Captain Man)

03:12.818 --> 03:14.903
In time, I realized

03:12.818 --> 03:14.903
that being a superhero

03:14.945 --> 03:16.446
is a lot to handle alone.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.614
He wanted some help.

03:17.656 --> 03:18.991
(Captain Man)

03:17.656 --> 03:18.991
I needed a sidekick.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.575
(Henry)

03:19.033 --> 03:20.575
I, Henry hart...

03:20.617 --> 03:22.119
(Captain Man)

03:20.617 --> 03:22.119
Pledge to never ever ever...

03:20.617 --> 03:22.119
tell anyone...

03:22.161 --> 03:24.621
That I'm Captain Man's

03:22.161 --> 03:24.621
It is done.ecret sidekick.

03:24.663 --> 03:25.998
(Henry)

03:24.663 --> 03:25.998
Now we blow bubbles.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.290
(Captain Man)

03:26.040 --> 03:27.290
And fight crime.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.083
(Henry)

03:27.332 --> 03:28.083
Feels good.

03:29.501 --> 03:34.381
(music)

03:42.764 --> 03:44.850
Up the tube!

03:45.851 --> 03:46.768
(Henry)

03:45.851 --> 03:46.768
Oh, my boot.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.603
(Captain Man)

03:47.352 --> 03:48.603
Ha!

03:57.571 --> 03:58.238
Ugh.

04:00.699 --> 04:01.616
Ugh.

04:06.872 --> 04:07.831
You guys are late for work.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.417
It's only 3:31.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.710
We're one minute late.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.045
Yeah.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.379
You know how much crime

04:13.087 --> 04:14.379
can happen in one minute?

04:14.755 --> 04:15.463
No.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.381
How much?

04:16.882 --> 04:17.674
I don't know.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.301
But none of us are going to rest

04:20.343 --> 04:21.595
till we catch

04:20.343 --> 04:21.595
these dang Wall Dogs.

04:21.636 --> 04:22.930
Okay. Chill out.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.347
It's just a graffiti gang.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.933
That's right.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.392
And graffiti is a crime.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.978
Are you okay?

04:30.020 --> 04:32.480
Because we don't get why you're

04:30.020 --> 04:32.480
this upset about graffiti.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.191
Do you want to get it?

04:34.775 --> 04:35.609
Do you?

04:36.359 --> 04:37.277
I don't know.

04:37.318 --> 04:38.695
I really don't care either way.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.699
It was 30 years ago.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.119
It was long before

04:43.450 --> 04:45.119
I was indestructible.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.328
Oh, that day.

04:49.248 --> 04:52.292
Yay. Yay.

04:49.248 --> 04:52.292
What a great day this is.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.295
Hey.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.295
What's up?

04:56.004 --> 04:57.881
Oh, hi.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.881
My name's Ray.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.549
Do you guys want to play?

04:59.591 --> 05:00.259
Yeah.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.468
We want to play.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.181
Hey. Hey.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.557
Do his playhouse.

05:07.599 --> 05:08.391
(Kid)

05:07.599 --> 05:08.391
Get it good.

05:09.101 --> 05:09.935
No!

05:09.977 --> 05:11.686
Not my playhouse!

05:12.062 --> 05:13.272
Don't!

05:13.814 --> 05:15.190
No graffiti!

05:15.690 --> 05:19.236
This is something

05:15.690 --> 05:19.236
I'll never forget!

05:21.321 --> 05:22.405
I never forgot it.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.828
Okay, well don't worry, man,

05:27.869 --> 05:29.704
we'll find the Wall Dogs

05:27.869 --> 05:29.704
and we'll stop them.

05:30.122 --> 05:32.040
But they say

05:30.122 --> 05:32.040
there's a bunch of them.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.667
How are we going

05:32.082 --> 05:33.667
to stop them all?

05:33.708 --> 05:35.043
Easy.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.254
You want to kill a snake,

05:35.085 --> 05:37.254
what do you do?

05:37.296 --> 05:38.213
Get a shotgun.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.133
No. Jeez.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.095
I meant, to stop the whole gang,

05:45.137 --> 05:47.264
we just have to capture

05:45.137 --> 05:47.264
the leader of the gang.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.390
(Both)

05:47.764 --> 05:49.390
Ah.

05:51.392 --> 05:52.269
(elevator dings)

05:55.438 --> 05:56.148
(Ray)

05:55.438 --> 05:56.148
There.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.066
Yikes.

05:58.108 --> 05:58.775
(Henry)

05:58.108 --> 05:58.775
Who's that?

05:59.609 --> 06:00.610
- Van Del.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.279
Watch.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.865
<i>I am Van Del,</i>

06:04.906 --> 06:07.408
<i>pack leader of the Wall Dogs.</i>

06:07.450 --> 06:08.910
<i>We are not criminals.</i>

06:09.286 --> 06:10.996
<i>We are not animals.</i>

06:11.038 --> 06:13.040
<i>We are artists.</i>

06:13.581 --> 06:15.083
<i>And these...</i>

06:15.125 --> 06:19.254
<i>These are our weapons</i>

06:15.125 --> 06:19.254
<i>of artistic destruction.</i>

06:19.963 --> 06:22.507
<i>Prepare to be sprayed.</i>

06:22.966 --> 06:24.467
<i>(Woman)</i>

06:22.966 --> 06:24.467
<i>Vanny!</i>

06:24.509 --> 06:26.303
<i>You left your wet laundry</i>

06:24.509 --> 06:26.303
<i>in the washing machine!</i>

06:27.470 --> 06:29.597
<i>I- 'll move it in a minute, mom!</i>

06:31.432 --> 06:32.184
<i>(sighs)</i>

06:33.060 --> 06:34.311
<i>Edit that part out.</i>

06:34.353 --> 06:35.312
<i>(Man)</i>

06:34.353 --> 06:35.312
<i>Sure, no problem.</i>

06:37.314 --> 06:40.150
All right,

06:37.314 --> 06:40.150
we know he has a mother

06:40.984 --> 06:42.110
and a lazy editor.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.071
(laughs)

06:47.074 --> 06:48.367
Where's Oliver?

06:48.407 --> 06:49.743
I don't know.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.037
I'm just his friend.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.037
I'm not in charge of the guy.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.622
You help him get dressed

06:52.996 --> 06:54.622
in the morning.

06:54.664 --> 06:55.623
So?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.000
He picks the clothes.

06:57.625 --> 06:58.543
(doorbell rings)

06:59.711 --> 07:00.712
Maybe that's him.

07:01.671 --> 07:04.423
Hey, so how much money do we get

07:01.671 --> 07:04.423
if we catch the Wall Dogs?

07:04.465 --> 07:05.884
10,000 bucks.

07:05.926 --> 07:06.927
Nice.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.346
Hi.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.932
Hi.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.769
Who's the feem?

07:16.144 --> 07:18.397
She's my cousin.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.397
Her name is Krisha.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.899
She's a little weird.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.152
Well, why'd you bring her?

07:24.194 --> 07:25.779
Because we're searching

07:24.194 --> 07:25.779
for the Wall Dogs,

07:25.820 --> 07:27.781
and she has an amazing

07:25.820 --> 07:27.781
sense of smell.

07:28.323 --> 07:29.116
Smell?

07:29.157 --> 07:29.950
Yeah.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.702
Krisha, sniff Jasper's mouth.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.372
(Oliver)

07:34.121 --> 07:35.372
Tell us what he had for lunch.

07:36.664 --> 07:37.582
(sniffs)

07:38.250 --> 07:39.042
Chicken...

07:40.460 --> 07:41.420
(sniffs)

07:41.461 --> 07:42.379
Nuggets.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.589
That's true.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.673
Whoa.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.467
Okay, she can join our posse.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.261
Yeah, I thought so.

07:49.303 --> 07:50.304
Sit on the couch.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.597
Okay, now...

07:53.974 --> 07:56.059
This map shows

07:53.974 --> 07:56.059
southwest Swellview.

07:56.101 --> 07:56.726
(Sydney)

07:56.101 --> 07:56.726
Wait.

07:57.269 --> 07:58.353
I think Krisha smells something.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.354
(sniffing)

07:59.687 --> 08:00.855
What is it, girl?

08:00.897 --> 08:01.982
(sniffs)

08:02.023 --> 08:03.317
Someone's coming.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.192
(sniffs)

08:04.234 --> 08:05.402
It's a child.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.194
What makes you think--

08:06.236 --> 08:07.695
Mom, I'm hungry!

08:09.364 --> 08:11.408
Piper,

08:09.364 --> 08:11.408
I'm trying to have a meeting.

08:11.866 --> 08:12.993
Where's Henry?

08:13.034 --> 08:14.369
At work.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.703
He said I could have

08:14.411 --> 08:15.703
my meeting here.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.788
Why?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.333
Because my parents

08:17.164 --> 08:19.333
don't like young people.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.128
All right,

08:21.293 --> 08:23.128
meeting's over, get out.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.005
Hey, hey, hey.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.131
Get out.

08:26.173 --> 08:26.965
Tell your story walking.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.342
I can have a meeting here.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.177
Get out, get out,

08:28.383 --> 08:30.177
get out of here.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.219
Go take a bath.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.012
Fine.

08:32.387 --> 08:34.348
But when we get the $10,000

08:34.389 --> 08:36.057
I'm not going to show you

08:34.389 --> 08:36.057
my new feet.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.852
What $10,000?

08:38.893 --> 08:41.104
The reward we're going

08:38.893 --> 08:41.104
to get from the police.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.939
When we catch the Wall Dogs.

08:44.483 --> 08:45.900
All right, back inside.

08:45.942 --> 08:46.651
Go sit down.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.195
Sit. Sit down.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.070
Sit.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.280
Come on.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.281
Sit down.

08:54.159 --> 08:57.078
So, who's in charge

08:54.159 --> 08:57.078
of this little group here?

08:57.620 --> 08:58.205
I am.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.539
Not anymore.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.668
Yay.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.546
I mean, boo.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.978
(Kid Danger)

09:20.310 --> 09:21.978
I don't think

09:20.310 --> 09:21.978
the Wall Dogs are coming here.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.563
Schwoz said they are.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.900
Come on, it's after 2:00 A.M.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.900
Let's go.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.693
No.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.071
Until those disgusting Wall Dogs

09:28.735 --> 09:31.071
show up here and we catch them,

09:31.112 --> 09:32.739
neither one of us

09:31.112 --> 09:32.739
leaves this spot.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.534
Now, wait here.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.534
I got to go pee.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.703
You just said

09:36.951 --> 09:38.703
we can't leave this spot.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.081
I've had a gallon of soda.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.081
What goes in must come out.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.839
Braw.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.299
I'm the hand monster.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.967
Grr.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.511
(laughing)

09:54.553 --> 09:56.054
Ah, it's fun to pretend.

09:58.223 --> 10:01.101
(muffled voices)

10:03.686 --> 10:06.022
Hey, come on,

10:03.686 --> 10:06.022
let's tag the windmill.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.358
(group chatters)

10:12.404 --> 10:13.696
Freeze, Wall Dogs!

10:15.282 --> 10:17.284
All right, now,

10:18.535 --> 10:20.954
I only have

10:18.535 --> 10:20.954
this one pair of handcuffs,

10:22.080 --> 10:23.873
but Captain Man's going

10:22.080 --> 10:23.873
to be back in a second

10:23.915 --> 10:24.999
and he has more handcuffs.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.585
So, until he gets here--

10:26.626 --> 10:29.045
Hey, wait!

10:26.626 --> 10:29.045
Hey, hey, hey!

10:32.173 --> 10:33.883
Ha! Gotcha, dude!

10:34.884 --> 10:36.136
Now, you better just--

10:37.095 --> 10:39.806
Whoa, you're a girl dog.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.183
Thanks for noticing.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.351
Get him, Reeko!

10:46.896 --> 10:47.939
Okay.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.857
Okay.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.857
There was no Reeko.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.818
Just let me go.

10:51.859 --> 10:52.902
Where's Van del?

10:53.653 --> 10:54.654
Who's Van Del?

10:54.695 --> 10:56.739
You know, your leader.

10:56.781 --> 10:57.449
Never heard of him.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.866
Don't lie.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.161
You guys have been running

10:58.908 --> 11:01.161
around all over Swellview

11:01.202 --> 11:02.496
messing up buildings.

11:02.537 --> 11:03.830
Now, put your hands

11:02.537 --> 11:03.830
behind your back.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.540
Ugh.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.540
You're such a Herbert.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.916
I am not a Herbert.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.668
What is a Herbert?

11:10.044 --> 11:11.212
A dork.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.422
Someone who's lame.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.924
Someone who doesn't understand

11:13.006 --> 11:14.924
what the Wall Dogs stand for,

11:14.966 --> 11:16.468
which is artistic defiance.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.427
Herbert.

11:17.802 --> 11:18.803
Or...

11:18.845 --> 11:20.430
Maybe you're just a punk

11:20.472 --> 11:22.765
who runs around town at night

11:20.472 --> 11:22.765
wearing your dark clothes

11:22.807 --> 11:24.142
and dumb mask

11:24.184 --> 11:26.060
spray painting stupid stuff

11:24.184 --> 11:26.060
because you're a loser.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.651
(crying)

11:35.570 --> 11:38.239
All right.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.239
Oh, I'm sorry, no.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.698
I didn't mean what I said.

11:39.740 --> 11:40.783
Okay hey.

11:40.825 --> 11:41.576
Hey, come on.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.661
Come on, whoa, what the--

11:45.121 --> 11:46.456
Oh, dang it!

11:49.459 --> 11:51.503
So, I got to go now.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.505
Try not to miss me too much.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.215
Or this handcuff key.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.177
This isn't over.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.346
You can run now,

11:59.219 --> 12:01.346
but sooner or later

12:01.388 --> 12:02.597
I'm going to find you.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.182
Well, I'll make it easy for you.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.518
Meet me tomorrow night,

12:07.310 --> 12:08.019
midnight,

12:08.978 --> 12:10.480
right under the Swellview sign.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.148
Come alone.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.608
Alone?

12:14.234 --> 12:15.402
Hey, what are you--

12:15.443 --> 12:16.903
No, you better not--

12:15.443 --> 12:16.903
No, no, please don't.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.616
Isn't that more fun

12:19.989 --> 12:21.616
than fighting with me?

12:22.325 --> 12:23.284
No.

12:24.536 --> 12:25.620
Maybe.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.498
Kind of. I can't be sure

12:26.829 --> 12:28.498
unless you do it again.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.876
Maybe I will tomorrow night

12:32.335 --> 12:33.587
if you come alone.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.171
But I...

12:35.213 --> 12:36.089
Bye, Herbert.

12:46.015 --> 12:46.974
Hey.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.060
I'm done peeing.

12:55.483 --> 13:00.447
(music)

13:00.488 --> 13:01.155
(elevator dings)

13:06.286 --> 13:08.288
Will you guys hurry up and get

13:06.286 --> 13:08.288
these handcuffs off of me?

13:08.829 --> 13:10.749
I've had an itch for an hour

13:08.829 --> 13:10.749
and I can't scratch it.

13:10.789 --> 13:11.790
Where's your itch?

13:11.832 --> 13:13.126
We'll scratch it for you.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.086
Eh, I don't think

13:13.167 --> 13:15.086
you want to do that.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.131
Hey,

13:16.170 --> 13:18.131
give me one of my gum balls.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.553
Start trying to pick the lock.

13:23.595 --> 13:24.304
Yep.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.847
Hang on.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.847
I'm going to change back.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.439
Okay, try to unlock me.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.815
You know,

13:35.482 --> 13:36.815
I don't understand you.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.025
What did I do?

13:38.067 --> 13:39.818
You let all the Wall Dogs

13:38.067 --> 13:39.818
get away.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.780
Hey, I caught one.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.157
Till she tricked me

13:44.198 --> 13:45.992
and handcuffed me

13:44.198 --> 13:45.992
to this ball washer.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.536
She?

13:48.578 --> 13:49.621
You never said she was a girl.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.205
Well, she was.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.082
And she was really tough.

13:54.751 --> 13:55.418
And pretty.

13:56.711 --> 13:57.337
She had these...

13:57.878 --> 13:59.213
These eyes...

14:00.632 --> 14:01.924
And this face...

14:01.966 --> 14:04.177
Oh, she had eyes and a face?

14:04.218 --> 14:06.179
Well, at least we have

14:04.218 --> 14:06.179
a description of her.

14:10.891 --> 14:11.934
Why are you looking at me?

14:12.310 --> 14:13.728
What's that on your lips?

14:13.770 --> 14:14.895
I don't know.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.106
Lip skin?

14:18.650 --> 14:19.317
Sticky...

14:21.402 --> 14:22.862
Strawberry.

14:23.655 --> 14:24.823
Lip gloss?

14:26.073 --> 14:27.450
Did you kiss that girl Wall Dog?

14:28.618 --> 14:29.869
No.

14:30.829 --> 14:31.830
She kissed me.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.206
(Both)

14:31.871 --> 14:33.206
Oh my God.

14:34.582 --> 14:35.249
What?

14:35.291 --> 14:36.292
You let your guard down

14:36.334 --> 14:37.752
and you let a criminal escape

14:37.794 --> 14:39.754
because the criminal

14:37.794 --> 14:39.754
happened to be a pretty girl?

14:39.796 --> 14:42.048
An extremely pretty girl.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.050
There,

14:43.049 --> 14:44.050
got the handcuffs off.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.930
Ray, I'm sorry.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.225
I really did try

14:50.515 --> 14:52.225
to catch the Wall Dogs.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.394
All right.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.398
I just wish we had

14:57.063 --> 14:58.398
more information.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.401
Like where their hideout is

15:01.442 --> 15:02.943
or where they're

15:01.442 --> 15:02.943
going to strike next.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.904
Did the girl that kissed you

15:03.444 --> 15:04.904
say anything

15:04.945 --> 15:05.864
that could help us find them?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.240
Or find her?

15:08.949 --> 15:10.284
Meet me tomorrow night,

15:10.910 --> 15:11.870
midnight,

15:12.495 --> 15:14.288
right under the Swellview sign.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.040
Come alone.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.210
No, she didn't say anything.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.045
Really?

15:21.087 --> 15:22.547
Because it looked like you were

15:21.087 --> 15:22.547
thinking about something.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.340
Yeah.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.340
What were you thinking about?

15:25.966 --> 15:27.134
Pizza.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.437
Well,

15:35.184 --> 15:37.437
it's about time you're back.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.480
(panting)

15:40.774 --> 15:42.191
(sighs)

15:44.485 --> 15:45.194
Jasper?

15:46.487 --> 15:48.155
Is that you?

15:50.825 --> 15:51.826
(Krisha)

15:50.825 --> 15:51.826
Look.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.536
I caught a Wall Dog.

15:53.578 --> 15:54.995
What?

15:55.037 --> 15:57.039
I saw him painting

15:55.037 --> 15:57.039
the house down the street.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.291
That's because I'm a painter.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.376
They're paying me

15:58.332 --> 16:00.376
to paint the garage.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.755
Shut up, Wall Dog.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.257
He's not a Wall Dog.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.092
That's a legit house painter.

16:11.554 --> 16:15.182
Okay, you people were

16:11.554 --> 16:15.182
supposed to find the Wall Dogs.

16:15.683 --> 16:16.851
What happened?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.979
Well, I was down

16:17.310 --> 16:19.979
by the new jandy bridge

16:20.020 --> 16:21.731
looking for the Wall Dogs

16:22.231 --> 16:25.025
and a mean cat

16:22.231 --> 16:25.025
chased me into the river.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.152
(Piper)

16:25.443 --> 16:26.152
Ugh.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.738
Your story's lamer than his.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.323
What happened to you?

16:30.949 --> 16:31.908
I...

16:32.533 --> 16:34.327
I was in Swellview Park...

16:35.703 --> 16:38.498
And I thought I heard

16:35.703 --> 16:38.498
somebody hiding in the bushes

16:39.624 --> 16:40.708
so I reached in

16:41.375 --> 16:43.169
and a snake bit my hand.

16:48.967 --> 16:52.178
Okay, how can all three of you

16:48.967 --> 16:52.178
be so incompetent?

16:53.346 --> 16:54.973
Hi.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.809
Where have you been?

16:58.351 --> 17:01.145
In Henry's room

16:58.351 --> 17:01.145
trying on his clothes.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.691
Please take me to a hospital.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.110
Okay.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.070
Get up.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.031
Get up.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.031
- (groans)

17:12.072 --> 17:15.284
- Come on, all of you, get up.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.621
Now, get out of here

17:18.663 --> 17:22.625
and go find the Wall Dogs

17:18.663 --> 17:22.625
so we can get the $10,000.

17:22.667 --> 17:23.459
- Okay.

17:23.501 --> 17:24.168
- I think I'm dying.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.380
I'm serious.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.424
Don't come back

17:27.421 --> 17:30.424
without a Wall Dog.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.718
- Okay.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.718
- I'm dying.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.385
I'm going, I'm going.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.246
Hey!

18:01.247 --> 18:02.164
Hello?

18:04.458 --> 18:05.376
Girl?

18:06.794 --> 18:07.503
Here, Wall Dog.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.546
(whistles)

18:15.887 --> 18:17.597
You know you could have

18:15.887 --> 18:17.597
just walked up to me.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.939
You came here alone, right?

18:25.980 --> 18:27.273
Yeah, I'm alone.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.191
Good to know.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.737
Hey, I don't even

18:30.317 --> 18:32.737
know your name.

18:33.404 --> 18:34.614
Then why don't you guess?

18:34.989 --> 18:36.866
Here's a hint, it's Veronika.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.202
That's a pretty specific hint,

18:38.284 --> 18:40.202
Veronika.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.252
What's this for?

18:50.504 --> 18:51.923
Let's go to work

18:50.504 --> 18:51.923
on the Swellview sign.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.340
What?

18:51.965 --> 18:53.340
No, are you, crazy?

18:54.300 --> 18:55.927
Are you really going

18:54.300 --> 18:55.927
to be a Herbert?

18:55.969 --> 18:57.678
I am not a Herbert.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.806
This sign is

18:58.345 --> 18:59.806
the property of our city,

18:59.847 --> 19:01.599
and I'm not going to let you

18:59.847 --> 19:01.599
do something illegal to it.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.601
Oh, you think just

19:01.641 --> 19:03.601
because something is illegal

19:03.643 --> 19:04.393
means it's wrong?

19:05.103 --> 19:06.395
Well, yeah.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.231
I'm an artist.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.942
The Wall Dogs are artists.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.611
Don't you like artists?

19:14.194 --> 19:15.113
Sure.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.406
But why should

19:15.696 --> 19:17.406
everyone in Swellview

19:17.448 --> 19:19.241
be forced to look at your art?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.787
Why am I forced to look

19:20.493 --> 19:22.787
at giant billboards

19:22.829 --> 19:24.580
advertising things

19:22.829 --> 19:24.580
I don't want to buy?

19:25.039 --> 19:27.291
Like diapers and lawyers?

19:28.584 --> 19:30.795
Maybe some lawyers need diapers.

19:31.629 --> 19:32.880
I don't know.

19:34.048 --> 19:35.508
Maybe we should just kiss again.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.806
(helicopter whirring)

19:44.017 --> 19:45.810
A police helicopter?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.103
You called the cops on me?

19:47.561 --> 19:49.730
No, I did.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.942
Captain Man?

19:52.984 --> 19:54.027
You said you came alone.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.778
I thought I did.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.778
How'd you find me?

19:55.820 --> 19:56.863
I followed you.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.405
Then I hid

19:56.904 --> 19:58.405
in those bushes over there

19:58.447 --> 19:59.740
and watched you two kiss.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.119
I know that sounds weird

20:01.283 --> 20:03.119
but it's my job.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.746
(Policeman)

20:04.120 --> 20:05.746
Captain Man! Look!

20:05.788 --> 20:06.664
We're up here!

20:06.706 --> 20:07.915
I know!

20:07.957 --> 20:08.875
(Policeman)

20:07.957 --> 20:08.875
We're in the helicopter!

20:08.916 --> 20:10.084
I know!

20:13.129 --> 20:14.296
You shouldn't have come here.

20:15.173 --> 20:16.799
And you shouldn't

20:15.173 --> 20:16.799
have lied to me.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.178
One of us has to protect

20:17.842 --> 20:20.178
the city from trash like her.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.595
All right, don't call her trash.

20:22.180 --> 20:22.847
Trash.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.306
She's not trash.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.266
And you're not

20:24.724 --> 20:26.266
taking her anywhere...

20:27.185 --> 20:28.352
Old man.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.312
How dare you.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.899
You know I'm sensitive

20:31.397 --> 20:32.899
about my age.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.651
By the way, I'm only 34.

20:37.444 --> 20:40.322
Now, she's going to jail.

20:41.074 --> 20:41.657
Come here.

20:41.699 --> 20:42.783
Get off me.

20:42.825 --> 20:43.743
Leave her alone.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.245
(grunting)

20:51.333 --> 20:53.920
That was not okay.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.755
Aah!

20:55.796 --> 20:57.715
(grunting)

21:29.371 --> 21:31.373
- Aah!

21:32.374 --> 21:33.626
(Captain Man)

21:32.374 --> 21:33.626
I'm okay.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.920
You just pushed Captain Man

21:33.667 --> 21:35.920
down a mountain.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.463
Well, I couldn't let him

21:35.962 --> 21:37.463
take you to jail.

21:37.504 --> 21:38.589
Come on, we got to go.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.924
But the helicopter has lights.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.092
They'll follow us.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.469
Not if I put out their lights.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.722
Ha! Missed us!

21:48.015 --> 21:48.975
Maybe you should aim.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.520
Aah! He got it!

21:50.977 --> 21:53.520
Fly away!

21:55.522 --> 21:57.900
So, how does it feel being bad?

21:58.776 --> 22:00.027
Feels good.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.352
(Ding)

22:34.394 --> 22:35.729
Mmm.
