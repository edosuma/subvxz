<i>just like Shao always said we would.</i>

49:40.311 --> 49:44.148
You know I've been building the Super High
Voltage record label since I was like...

49:45.023 --> 49:46.442
ten years old, right?

49:46.525 --> 49:47.775
[Little Wolf] Probably younger.

49:49.360 --> 49:51.530
All my life
I only ever wanted two things.

49:53.114 --> 49:55.284
To dance. You know...

49:55.826 --> 49:59.496
send that positive message
to all womankind, but...

50:00.164 --> 50:03.000
- with a little subtext.
- What's the second thing, man?

50:06.336 --> 50:07.253
To go to space.

50:08.297 --> 50:09.840
Be the first black man in space.

50:10.465 --> 50:11.467
What? That's...

50:11.550 --> 50:13.552
I'd dance all over
that motherfucking moon.

50:13.635 --> 50:15.137
[all laugh]

50:16.679 --> 50:18.599
I ain't going back in that house, man.

50:18.681 --> 50:20.099
Not tonight, not ever.

50:20.976 --> 50:22.644
I can't face her, and I don't wanna.

50:22.853 --> 50:25.898
- [Little Wolf] Y'all own the place, man.
- I don't own shit.

50:27.942 --> 50:31.570
Them kids back there, their music stinks,
but they own it.

50:33.697 --> 50:37.784
And I ain't never liked Shaolin Fan-Faggot
but I respect his move.

50:39.786 --> 50:40.746
Living for his art.

50:43.039 --> 50:43.958
Telling his truth.

50:45.501 --> 50:50.588
Yeah, well...
now it's time for me to tell my truth.

50:53.050 --> 50:54.009
[Slim grunts]

50:54.425 --> 50:55.469
[Slim] What you doing, man?

50:58.514 --> 51:00.556
Here. I won't be needing this...

51:01.557 --> 51:04.769
as the full-time president
of Super High Voltage Records.

51:04.936 --> 51:06.438
- Full-time, man?
- That's right.

51:06.896 --> 51:10.567
I'm cashing all out of my gangster
and going all in on my label.

51:12.277 --> 51:13.653
No more hedging life's bets.

51:15.697 --> 51:16.990
Shit, I'll be 30 next week.

51:23.289 --> 51:24.164
Good night, Caddy.

51:29.043 --> 51:30.878
Mylene, Mylene.

51:32.755 --> 51:33.590

51:36.092 --> 51:39.887
If I'm a disco king...
would you be my disco queen?

51:40.097 --> 51:42.099
[disco music playing]

51:54.612 --> 51:58.949
You tell Shane if he hasn't found Mylene
by sundown, he's fucking fired.

52:01.492 --> 52:03.746
- Mylene.
- Roy.

52:05.121 --> 52:07.791
So, my darlings,
are we all in agreement here?

52:08.166 --> 52:13.088
Absolutely, Stiggy,
we cannot wait to start doing business

52:13.505 --> 52:16.925
- with you.
- No, not business, Roy. Big business.

52:17.467 --> 52:19.344
Always think big, matey.

52:19.637 --> 52:20.971
Now, if you'll excuse me,

52:21.054 --> 52:24.057
I have to organize a chopper
to take me and John to the airport.

52:24.141 --> 52:26.268
A helicopter? Why not just take a cab?

52:26.643 --> 52:27.978
Travolta prefers choppers.

52:28.561 --> 52:30.438
So do I. Back in a minute.

52:32.608 --> 52:38.280
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
This is all very tremendously exciting.

52:38.364 --> 52:41.115
So, before Stigwood comes back in here,

52:41.574 --> 52:45.704
we have to be sure that we are conjoined
at the hip on certain critical issues,

52:45.788 --> 52:49.958
starting with the Starship Twins
banging out the rest of your tracks

52:50.041 --> 52:53.753
so we can get you in the studio
to record "See You on the Other Side"

52:53.836 --> 52:55.963
as the first single off your full-fledged

52:56.047 --> 53:00.052
new Mylene Cruz record album.

53:00.135 --> 53:03.639
- What do you think about that?
- Roy, you forgot the Soul Madonnas.

53:03.722 --> 53:05.891
- Who?
- We're Mylene Cruz...

53:06.266 --> 53:08.226
- and the Soul Madonnas.
- [Regina] Yep.

53:08.684 --> 53:10.396
What's the matter, you don't like us?

53:10.478 --> 53:14.315
Listen, why don't you take Veronica here
down to the 21 Club,

53:14.400 --> 53:17.820
pick up some nice shrimp cocktails
for yourself, okay? Two hundred enough?

53:18.027 --> 53:20.114
- Her name's Regina.
- Of course.

53:20.197 --> 53:21.989
Yo, yo, give Roy the money back.

53:22.074 --> 53:23.282
Are you crazy? Why?

53:23.367 --> 53:24.867
Because Roy is fired.

53:24.952 --> 53:27.496
- [laughing] What?
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

53:28.038 --> 53:29.456
- Roy's fired?
- That's right.

53:29.539 --> 53:31.125
- I'm keeping this money.
- Hells yeah.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.126
Jackie, I don't know
if you're fucking around...

53:33.210 --> 53:37.630
Don't look at me. Okay?
This is news to me. Okay?

53:38.340 --> 53:39.425
I mean, I like it.

53:39.967 --> 53:42.469
[Mylene] Roy, we can make
Stigwood's new movie without you.

53:42.552 --> 53:45.264
- Isn't that right, Jackie?
- It's true. It's true, Roy.

53:45.347 --> 53:48.266
You know, me, the kid, Stiggy,
we hit it off. You know?

53:48.641 --> 53:49.476
We bonded.

53:50.436 --> 53:53.438
- Call it kismet.
- You call it kismet, I'll call my lawyer.

53:53.521 --> 53:57.150
Listen, Mylene, you signed a contract
with me, an exclusive contract,

53:57.233 --> 53:58.735
and that contract says

53:58.818 --> 54:03.364
that I have creative control and final say
on everything you sing or record

54:03.449 --> 54:05.742
for the next seven years.

54:05.826 --> 54:07.202
I am from the Bronx.

54:07.286 --> 54:08.494
My father is dead,

54:08.579 --> 54:10.121
my family is destroyed

54:10.204 --> 54:11.664
and I am still here.

54:12.458 --> 54:16.043
You have no idea what I am capable of.

54:17.545 --> 54:19.130
Jackie, girls, we're leaving.

54:22.384 --> 54:24.177
Okay, okay, okay. Wait, wait.

54:24.260 --> 54:25.387
Wait.

54:25.471 --> 54:27.222
Sit down. I'm impressed.

54:28.514 --> 54:31.643
Why don't you tell me what you want?

54:32.518 --> 54:34.896
[Mylene]
From now on, you work for me, Roy.

54:35.898 --> 54:36.731
Here.

54:37.648 --> 54:38.900
I wrote it all down.

54:44.572 --> 54:48.367
Fucking bullshit! This is fucking highway
robbery! Are you fucking kidding me?

54:48.452 --> 54:50.786
- Let me tell you fucking...
- [Stigwood] Travolta wants pizza.

54:50.871 --> 54:51.704
Care to join?

54:54.291 --> 54:58.920
- Is everything copacetic here?
- Fine, fine, beautiful. Pizza, great.

54:59.003 --> 55:01.172
[laughs] Pizza.

55:02.132 --> 55:04.760
Twenty four and a half percent,
not a penny more.

55:08.137 --> 55:08.972
Done.

55:10.224 --> 55:12.266
- Done. We'll take it.

56:05.987 --> 56:08.364
- [Moran] Inspector Moran! Open up!
- [banging on door]

56:08.614 --> 56:11.577
You ain't gotta bang
on my fucking door like it's a drum, pig.

56:12.034 --> 56:13.119
Miles Kipling,

56:13.202 --> 56:16.873
you are under arrest
for distributing felony quantities of PCP.

56:17.666 --> 56:19.585
And Shao, Mama says...

56:19.668 --> 56:24.005
Tell my little Superman I know
exactly where he keeps his kryptonite.

56:29.427 --> 56:30.762
[Ezekiel] What'd you do, Shao?

56:31.137 --> 56:32.514
What the fuck did you do?

56:39.938 --> 56:40.938
[Moran] Get in there.

56:51.782 --> 56:57.456
[muttering]
Fuck this... kung fu fucking bullshit.

56:57.539 --> 56:58.498
[Shaolin] Yo, Books.

57:01.208 --> 57:03.628
- Yo, what the fuck is wrong with you?
- Wrong with me?

57:04.211 --> 57:06.297
If you got something to say,
don't be a bitch.

57:06.380 --> 57:08.425
- Say it. What?
- All this motherfucking time.

57:08.507 --> 57:11.927
You had Boo-Boo selling for you,
you lied to my face!

57:12.596 --> 57:13.929
You lied to all of us.

57:15.056 --> 57:16.682
He's a fucking kid.

57:16.766 --> 57:18.768
He don't even know
his multiplication tables.

57:19.478 --> 57:21.563
- What was you thinking?
- Ain't what you think.

57:21.646 --> 57:23.940
It never is.
You got an excuse for everything.

57:24.023 --> 57:26.400
- Believe what you want, but the truth...
- The truth?

57:26.485 --> 57:28.445
The truth is that kid was selling for you.

57:28.527 --> 57:31.614
And you got him busted. You gonna
convince me that you a good dude?

57:31.697 --> 57:34.159
The same dude that brought a gun
to the Ivy Club?

57:34.242 --> 57:37.746
The same dude who got us mixed up
with Annie? I mean, I could go on and on.

57:41.875 --> 57:42.833
Well, fuck you!

57:44.293 --> 57:45.878
Who the fuck do you think you are?

57:45.963 --> 57:49.007
You know what people say about you?
That you're empty inside.

57:49.757 --> 57:52.052
That no one ever gave a fuck about you

57:52.135 --> 57:55.847
so you don't have any idea
how to look out for anybody but yourself.

57:56.806 --> 57:58.599
What other people say or what you say?

57:58.684 --> 58:00.143
Oh, you wanna know what I say?

58:00.226 --> 58:01.894
Yeah, nigga, brother.

58:03.438 --> 58:04.773
I say you fooled me, Shao.

58:06.858 --> 58:09.568
- Get the fuck out of here.
- You got me living in this world

58:09.902 --> 58:13.407
believing in Grandmasters
and Zulu Warriors

58:13.614 --> 58:16.159
and Hercules and kung fu.
It's all bullshit, man.

58:16.242 --> 58:18.911
Like life's one of Dizzee's comics
and they're our heroes.

58:18.996 --> 58:20.496
They can't save us.

58:21.081 --> 58:24.001
They can't protect us.
And outside the Bronx, it don't matter.

58:24.083 --> 58:26.878
And it never will because it ain't real.

58:27.713 --> 58:29.297
- It's fantasies!
- It's real to me.

58:30.465 --> 58:31.800
You don't even have a real name.

58:31.882 --> 58:33.844
- I got a name.
- Yeah? What's your name?

58:33.927 --> 58:35.762
- Shaolin Fantastic.
- That ain't a name.

58:35.846 --> 58:38.431
- You don't have the balls to tell me.
- I got some balls!

58:38.514 --> 58:41.184
- What's your name then? I did...
- My name's fuckin' Curtis!

58:43.144 --> 58:43.978
Curtis?

58:44.688 --> 58:47.023
Yeah, nigga, my name is fucking Curtis.

58:48.442 --> 58:49.608
You know what, Curtis?

58:53.405 --> 58:57.409
Papa Fuerte, Mr. Gunns, Mylene,
they was all right about you.

58:58.367 --> 58:59.827
They were right since jump street.

59:00.327 --> 59:01.329
You ain't magic...

59:02.581 --> 59:03.998
Shaolin Fantastic.

59:06.126 --> 59:07.001
You broken...

59:08.545 --> 59:09.378
Curtis.

59:11.840 --> 59:13.467
Never ever should have trusted you.

59:14.842 --> 59:17.429
Hey, hear me when I say this, all right?

59:19.389 --> 59:20.264
We're done.

59:21.349 --> 59:22.184
"Done" done.

59:23.184 --> 59:24.518
Don't come around me no more.

59:29.815 --> 59:32.068
Hey, yo, before you go, man,
check this shit out.

59:32.568 --> 59:36.197
We fucking done, huh?
We fucking done, huh?

59:36.489 --> 59:39.367
What happened to fucking family,
Books, huh?

59:39.701 --> 59:41.494
What happened to fucking family?

59:43.454 --> 59:46.541
Look at you. What's stopping me
from fucking you up right now, huh?

59:47.125 --> 59:49.753
What's stopping me from fucking you up
right now, Books?

59:54.257 --> 59:55.175
[grunts]

59:57.969 --> 59:59.137
You fucking lucky.

01:00:03.307 --> 01:00:04.893
All you do is put niggas on.

01:00:09.146 --> 01:00:10.190
[knocking]

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:22.119
I'm sorry.

01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:25.789
I'm so sorry.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:28.750
Please take me back.

01:00:32.503 --> 01:00:33.420
[Wanda] Of course.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:37.509
[kitten meows]

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.025
Well, well, well.

01:00:56.152 --> 01:01:00.407
If it ain't my Mark Antony
trying to play his Cleopatra for a fool.

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:01.782
Fuck you doing here, Annie?

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:03.577
Unfinished business.

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:06.829
Well, I ain't sorry
for what I done to you.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:11.083
You looking for this?

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:17.882
You wanna kill me... kill me.

01:01:17.965 --> 01:01:21.094
A mother doesn't kill her own.
That'd be unnatural.

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:22.429
However...

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:26.432
I will kill every member
of your little music group

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:29.393
if you don't go home with Mama
right now.

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:30.769
Kill them.

01:01:31.103 --> 01:01:34.648
- I don't give a fuck.
- Your problem, boy, is you do give a fuck.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:38.820
You never should've let that Boo-Boo
work with you. You should've stood alone.

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:41.114
But you needed a friend, didn't you?

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:42.615
I raised you ruthless,

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:46.244
but you went out on your own
and got soft, but that's okay.

01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:48.621
Mama forgives you.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:55.503
Now... you coming with me?
Or do I need to go on a murder spree?

01:01:56.086 --> 01:01:58.380
Starting with half-black,

01:01:58.465 --> 01:01:59.840
half rice-and-beans

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:03.094
Ezekiel Figuero boyfriend of yours.

01:02:03.177 --> 01:02:04.971
He's not my fucking boyfriend.

01:02:06.931 --> 01:02:08.349
Mama misses you, baby...

01:02:09.516 --> 01:02:11.061
but she ain't got all day.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:12.394
Let's go.

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:14.356
Let's go home, Mama.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:15.898
[chuckles]

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:18.610
There's hope for you yet.

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:22.530
You're leaving your shopping bag.

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:26.409
What's in there? Something moving.

01:02:30.871 --> 01:02:31.998
It ain't moving no more.

01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:09.911
Your politicians...

01:03:10.452 --> 01:03:11.704
They all the same.

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:13.456
Dirty rats.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.210
That came for you this morning.

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:39.231
What does it say?

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:43.360
I... I got in.

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:46.072
- Oh, my Lord.
- You got in! Zekey!

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:50.242
Let me see this.

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:55.456
It says here... they realized
if they didn't reach out to you...

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:57.500
you could go the other way...

01:03:58.043 --> 01:03:58.960
like Shaolin.

01:03:59.626 --> 01:04:00.753
Yeah, Shao.

01:04:01.503 --> 01:04:03.505
[Leon] Hey, hey. Don't take it like that.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.342
This ain't no charity, boy.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:08.010
Yale don't accept every Tom,
Dick and Henry.

01:04:08.552 --> 01:04:09.429
Now, that said...

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:13.349
- how in the hell they know about that boy?
- I wrote about him in my essay.

01:04:14.266 --> 01:04:18.396
You wrote about a drug dealer...
in your essay? And they took you?

01:04:19.313 --> 01:04:20.356
Oh, Zekey.

01:04:20.898 --> 01:04:22.817
I do not understand white people.

01:04:23.108 --> 01:04:27.030
- [chuckles]
- Your mother... would be so proud of you.

01:04:27.112 --> 01:04:30.657
- I'm sorry. I'm a mess.
- Nah, don't cry. You're gonna make me cry.

01:04:48.175 --> 01:04:50.762
- Hey. I'm a guest of Mylene Cruz.
- There.

01:04:51.346 --> 01:04:52.179
Hey, Mylene.

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:55.266
- [Mylene] Hey, Zeke.
- I got great news.

01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:57.059
Yeah, I got news, too.

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:58.853
Um...

01:05:01.271 --> 01:05:02.815
All right, come on, let's go eat.

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:04.608
I did like you said,

01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:06.860
I called the restaurant,
made a reservation.

01:05:07.695 --> 01:05:09.197
I'm not done recording yet.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.242
- I'm sorry. I feel awful.
- That's cool. No, we can go eat after.

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:14.494
Uh, without a reservation, but...

01:05:15.202 --> 01:05:16.746
Zeke, I'm going to California.

01:05:17.996 --> 01:05:18.831
I know.

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:21.083
Tonight, on a private jet.

01:05:21.166 --> 01:05:23.001
I just got off the phone with Stigwood.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.548
- Oh.
- Come here.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.262
Hey, uh, sorry, kids.
I need you back inside, Mylene.

01:05:32.594 --> 01:05:33.721
Just give me a minute.

01:05:33.929 --> 01:05:37.641
- Yeah, but... Sure, but Mylene...
- Roy, I said give us a minute.

01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:39.476
No problem.

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:50.362
So, I was talking to Yolanda and Regina.

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:54.576
And they said that maybe it's not fair
for me to ask you to wait for me.

01:05:55.367 --> 01:05:56.619
But you coming back, right?

01:05:58.621 --> 01:05:59.456
I think so.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:02.500
Yes, eventually.

01:06:02.916 --> 01:06:03.960
Then I'll wait for you.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.588
- You will?
- I'll always wait for you.

01:06:08.172 --> 01:06:10.007
I've been waiting on you my whole life.

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:15.262
Even when we together, there's still
a part of me waiting on you. That's okay.

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:19.224
- It is?
- You're worth the wait.

01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:22.228
You're my butterscotch queen.

01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:26.940
Okay.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.248
Zeke, why are you so good to me?

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.001
You know why.

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:49.213
For real, you're the best thing
that ever happened to me, Mylene.

01:06:50.215 --> 01:06:51.215
I love you.

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.800
I won't stop loving you.

01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:57.387
I love you.

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:00.432
Forever.

[Roy] Mylene...

01:07:04.603 --> 01:07:05.730
we gotta do this.

01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:08.315
I'd better...

01:07:08.815 --> 01:07:09.692
You better.

01:07:15.572 --> 01:07:17.407
Hey, kid, come on in. Check this out.

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:21.411
Oh, Zeke, what was that good news
that you wanted to tell me?

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:22.329
Oh.

01:07:24.581 --> 01:07:26.000
Not now. Open it on the plane.

Okay.
