WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:04.903
Surprise.

00:07.223 --> 00:08.583
Who's next?

00:08.623 --> 00:11.983
There'll be no women committing acts
of violence against women.

00:12.023 --> 00:13.383
Ferguson's invisible.

00:13.423 --> 00:16.143
- She's a ghost.
- Sonia has no idea.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.823
And what happens if
she figures it out?

00:18.863 --> 00:20.583
You're going to
need some protection.

00:20.623 --> 00:23.943
I don't respond well to extortion.
Can I get some H?

00:23.983 --> 00:27.343
You're a Kaz Proctor spy.
No, I'm not with Kaz anymore.

00:27.383 --> 00:28.383
Prove it, huh?

00:31.743 --> 00:34.383
Your hearing's been postponed.
No, no, no, it's gotta be today.

00:34.423 --> 00:35.623
Right, everyone out.

00:36.983 --> 00:39.103
I reckon you should
move into protection.

00:39.143 --> 00:42.863
No.
Oh, fuck, Kaz.

00:42.903 --> 00:45.863
You OK?
What'd you do to the brawler?

00:45.903 --> 00:47.343
I loosened one of the wheels.

00:47.383 --> 00:49.743
Kaz could have died, and you made
me a part of it.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.103
I've done what you wanted.
Put Kaz in hospital.

00:52.143 --> 00:53.223
Home delivery.

00:54.583 --> 00:56.383
Maybe things'll be
different in the future.

00:57.343 --> 00:58.823
Now is the time.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074

02:21.023 --> 02:23.143
Change can be painful.

02:24.783 --> 02:29.063
Our lives spent working in the same
job, living in the same routine.

02:29.103 --> 02:32.663
Her world barely extends
beyond the walls of this prison.

02:32.703 --> 02:34.263
Pathetic little thing she is.

02:34.303 --> 02:36.343
She thinks she has
everything she ever wanted.

02:36.383 --> 02:40.823
Yet, she's completely ignorant
of the fact that her perfect

02:40.863 --> 02:46.823
little life has this
tiny, hidden seed of decay.

02:51.383 --> 02:53.463
It's your time, Jake.

02:53.503 --> 02:56.623
Time to spread that rot,
exploit our advantage.

02:56.663 --> 02:59.303
Think of the possibilities.

02:59.343 --> 03:00.799
I'll take care of things
on this side of the bars

03:00.823 --> 03:02.983
while you replace Vera
and become governor.

03:07.343 --> 03:08.543
How?

03:09.663 --> 03:13.183
One thing that Vera
fears more than change,

03:13.223 --> 03:14.983
it's turning into her mother.

03:16.823 --> 03:19.823
Growing old, alone and unloved.

03:19.863 --> 03:23.983
Go on, make her emotionally
dependent on you.

03:28.423 --> 03:30.863
And then we can crush her.

03:37.783 --> 03:39.663
Ferguson. Hey.

03:39.703 --> 03:41.823
Wake up.

03:41.863 --> 03:44.623
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

03:44.663 --> 03:47.783
H Block are now called for lunch.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.423
Kaz'll be useless.

03:53.463 --> 03:55.343
We got no hope.
You're joking.

03:55.383 --> 03:56.663
She's gonna be put down.

03:56.703 --> 03:59.383
How embarrassing.
Her name is shit.

03:59.423 --> 04:01.423
Lucy'd snap her anyway.

04:01.463 --> 04:02.503
All bark, no bite.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.863
She's weak.
She pretends, but she's gutless.

04:07.383 --> 04:09.063
And she can't make a decision.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.343
Little weakling.

04:13.303 --> 04:15.143
Lucy'd anyway.

04:19.702 --> 04:21.942
Yeah, we got no
hope with that Bambi.

04:21.983 --> 04:24.143
Tried old hag won't do shit.

04:24.183 --> 04:25.343
Want some help?
I'm right.

04:28.303 --> 04:29.783
Holy shit.

04:33.303 --> 04:36.663
Kaz can't let that slide. She's
gonna have to do something. Yeah.

04:46.943 --> 04:49.623
What are you doing, Joan?
Eating.

04:49.663 --> 04:54.903
Not at this table, you're not. Pick
up your tray and move over there.

04:54.943 --> 04:56.943
You heard the orders, Juice.

04:56.983 --> 04:58.743
She doesn't exist. She's invisible.

04:58.783 --> 05:01.543
If she's invisible, how do
you know she's sitting there?

05:04.983 --> 05:06.679
You wanna side with
her, you're on your own.

05:06.703 --> 05:09.183
What makes you think that
Lucy needs your support?

05:11.343 --> 05:13.663
You're a fuckin' moron, Juice.

05:13.703 --> 05:15.583
Good luck with that.

05:18.383 --> 05:20.263
Oh, look, boys.

05:20.303 --> 05:21.863
Boomer's got a new job.

05:21.903 --> 05:24.543
Wiping Greta Garbo's arse.

05:26.103 --> 05:28.343
Hey!
Look at you in your tracky dacks.

05:28.383 --> 05:31.463
Certainly not by choice.

05:31.503 --> 05:34.823
It was just easier to negotiate.
Well, you look a hell of a lot

05:34.863 --> 05:36.863
better than the last
time I saw you.

05:36.903 --> 05:40.383
Oh, thank you, Liz. I am better.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.463
Susan here's been a godsend.

05:42.503 --> 05:44.183
Just eggs, please, Susan.

05:44.223 --> 05:46.223
Scrambled. And my tea.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.263
I'll help you, Susan.

05:48.303 --> 05:49.903
How long you gonna be in that?

05:49.943 --> 05:53.223
Well, when you consider the ACL on
this knee and the torn ligament on

05:53.263 --> 05:57.543
this ankle, you could say
I haven't got a leg to stand on.

05:57.583 --> 06:00.943
You haven't touched your grub.

06:00.983 --> 06:02.583
You can have mine if you want.

06:02.623 --> 06:05.663
That's very kind,
but I'll wait for my eggs.

06:05.703 --> 06:10.063
Thank you.
Oh, fuck! Oh!

06:10.103 --> 06:13.383
Oh!
Shit, Juice, you're bleeding.

06:17.023 --> 06:19.663
Want some tommy sauce?

06:19.703 --> 06:23.903
You are a disgusting pig!
You fuckin' piece of shit!

06:23.943 --> 06:25.463
Boomer, let it go.

06:25.503 --> 06:27.743
What's going on, ladies?
I just broke my tooth

06:27.783 --> 06:31.063
on some bacon, Mr Jackson.
I cut me gum and all.

06:31.103 --> 06:33.583
I could sue you for that.
Hey, ya sick fuck!

06:33.623 --> 06:36.383
Boomer, take a seat.
They are just eggs.

06:36.423 --> 06:38.663
Liz can get her another tray.
Do you want another tray?

06:38.703 --> 06:40.263
I don't think I'm hungry anymore.

06:42.663 --> 06:44.823
I think Kaz is losing the women.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.383
How serious is it?

06:46.423 --> 06:48.743
A bit of grumbling.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.663
Right, well, it always
starts with a bit of grumbling.

06:51.703 --> 06:54.303
Even Bea bashed one or two.
It's what the women are used to.

06:54.343 --> 06:56.063
Well, I prefer Kaz's method.

06:56.103 --> 06:59.543
For all her bluster, she is
about protecting the women,

06:59.583 --> 07:01.863
particularly from each other.

07:01.903 --> 07:05.583
Oh, sorry, I'll come back later.
Ahh, no, it's OK. I'm done.

07:05.623 --> 07:08.823
Uh, just keep me in the loop, Will?
Sure.

07:15.983 --> 07:18.463
A little birdy told me
it's someone's birthday

07:18.503 --> 07:21.223
in a couple of days.
What? Who told you that?

07:21.263 --> 07:23.703
That's a bit sneaky of you,
keeping that under wraps.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.663
Well, I don't celebrate birthdays.
Rubbish.

07:25.703 --> 07:29.103
I mean it, Jake.
Do you now?

07:29.143 --> 07:31.903
Oh, well, in that case,
you're going to have to

07:31.943 --> 07:33.863
give me a pressie instead.

07:35.903 --> 07:38.943
OK, really. What?
You let me move in with you.

07:41.023 --> 07:42.783
Well, try not to
look too horrified.

07:42.823 --> 07:44.903
Is that...

07:44.943 --> 07:48.823
I'm sorry, is that a joke?
No. Come on,

07:48.863 --> 07:52.423
what do you say?
I'm...

07:52.463 --> 07:55.183
Um, I have to think about that.

07:56.383 --> 07:59.223
Sure. No pressure.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.263
What are you doing?
What?

08:17.303 --> 08:20.423
I saw you buy it. I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:20.463 --> 08:22.503
You reckon Red'd want to see you
back on the gear?

08:23.743 --> 08:26.423
I'm... I'm just...

08:26.463 --> 08:29.503
I'm going through a hard
patch at the moment. I just...

08:29.543 --> 08:31.359
I need a little bit of a help
to get me through, you know?

08:31.383 --> 08:33.063
What, and that's gonna help, is it?

08:33.102 --> 08:37.623
Don't pretend you give a shit,
Franky. You don't. Stay out of it.

08:37.663 --> 08:41.143
Fine. Get shitfaced. What do I care?

09:26.463 --> 09:28.703
Everyone's wondering why Juice is
not copping it.

09:28.743 --> 09:31.063
She bashed Sonia without
your approval

09:31.103 --> 09:34.423
and now she's hooking up
with the Freak.

09:34.463 --> 09:37.223
Lucy's crew and their new
mate can go to buggery.

09:37.263 --> 09:41.703
Yeah. Looks like it's getting a bit
crowded in buggery.

09:47.383 --> 09:51.783
Oh. How's that tooth?
Giving me the shits.

09:51.823 --> 09:56.343
So go see the dentist.
Big bull's piss-scared of dentists.

09:56.383 --> 10:00.143
Oh, fuck off, socket face.
In there, please.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.103
Yes, just under there.
Hey, Boomer!

10:02.143 --> 10:04.303
Do you have to trim her
vagitation, too?

10:04.343 --> 10:06.783
Polish the pearl
while you're at it!

10:08.703 --> 10:11.183
Booms!
Watch Boomer crack.

10:11.223 --> 10:14.983
Oh, I'm gonna play basketball.
I'm gonna punch some tits.

10:15.023 --> 10:16.143
Shit.

10:17.863 --> 10:21.943
Alright, everyone! Listen up!

10:21.983 --> 10:24.423
Now, I gave an order that Ferguson
was invisible.

10:24.463 --> 10:26.823
Some of you have chosen
to ignore that.

10:26.863 --> 10:29.903
That means you are no longer part
of the collective

10:29.943 --> 10:31.983
and you're on your fuckin' own.
Bullshit!

10:32.023 --> 10:37.183
There'll be no bashing women in retaliation.
I made that clear from the start.

10:37.223 --> 10:42.423
If you want to challenge me
on that, please, go ahead. Come on.

10:42.463 --> 10:44.743
You gonna say something?
You should.

10:44.783 --> 10:50.183
I know most of you women don't want to
go back to being ruled by violence.

10:50.223 --> 10:55.703
Am I right? Am I right?
Yeah.

10:58.263 --> 11:02.823
If anyone has an issue with the way I run
things, now's your chance to spit it out.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.463
Well?

11:16.383 --> 11:17.383
Anyone?

11:33.743 --> 11:37.743
Am I interrupting? Ooh!
I need to ask a favour.

11:42.383 --> 11:48.623
I feel like an invalid. My time in medical
gave me an opportunity to re-evaluate.

11:48.663 --> 11:49.823
Oh, yeah?

11:49.863 --> 11:51.983
I hate to admit it, but something
tells me

11:52.023 --> 11:53.983
I'm going to be in here
for rather a long time.

11:54.023 --> 11:56.503
Well, you don't know that.

11:56.543 --> 12:00.223
Did I tell you that the detective
who framed me has gone missing?

12:01.903 --> 12:07.023
No. No, you, uh
you never mentioned it.

12:07.063 --> 12:09.863
Vanished off the face of the Earth.
Oh.

12:09.903 --> 12:14.503
Mmm. He might have fucked me over,

12:14.543 --> 12:17.183
but he's not going to fuck
anyone else over.

12:18.783 --> 12:19.983
Ever again.

12:21.703 --> 12:23.023
You think Sonia murdered him?

12:23.063 --> 12:24.903
Well, if she killed her bestie
and her hubby,

12:24.943 --> 12:27.023
she's more than capable
of doing in a copper.

12:28.983 --> 12:32.103
Perhaps your fears are more a
manifestation of your guilt.

12:32.143 --> 12:34.623
You think I'm making it all up.
No, no, no, not at all.

12:34.663 --> 12:36.783
No, I think your fears
are very real to you.

12:36.823 --> 12:40.263
I'm not making up the fact
that Don's gone missing.

12:40.303 --> 12:45.303
Don's gone missing and I'm the only
one who seems to give a shit.

12:49.223 --> 12:51.063
Why are you so concerned about him,
Liz?

12:54.303 --> 12:55.903
Because I love him.

12:58.623 --> 13:00.503
No, it's more of a, um...

13:00.543 --> 13:03.863
It's more kind of like a, uh...

13:06.343 --> 13:11.743
We were, uh... We were gonna be
together when I got back out.

13:14.983 --> 13:19.143
Yeah. We were.

13:30.343 --> 13:34.303
Yeah, I reckon that curry for lunch
was dodgy, eh?

13:34.343 --> 13:39.223
Oh, yeah, um, I really gotta go take
a sh... You know.

13:39.263 --> 13:40.383
That OK with you?

13:40.423 --> 13:42.423
Don't be too long, Susan.

13:42.463 --> 13:44.183
Be as bloody long as I have to be.

14:07.423 --> 14:10.023
A vertical what?
Garden.

14:10.063 --> 14:15.503
This is a project, Governor, to
help beautify the prison walls.

14:17.063 --> 14:20.023
This'll be so great
for the women, Governor.

14:20.063 --> 14:22.743
And, I won't lie, for me too.

14:22.783 --> 14:26.903
I need something to exercise
my considerable skills.

14:26.943 --> 14:29.263
And, uh, how do you
propose to make this...

14:29.303 --> 14:31.703
Green walls.
That's what I'm calling them.

14:31.743 --> 14:36.103
Them? Well, we'll start with
one and just see how we go.

14:36.143 --> 14:39.503
Are you even capable of taking on
such a project?

14:39.543 --> 14:43.103
What a ridiculous question.
If it costs money...

14:43.143 --> 14:44.823
Oh, it will.
..I have certain

14:44.863 --> 14:46.743
philanthropic contacts.

14:48.103 --> 14:50.663
Give the women something
productive to do, Governor,

14:50.703 --> 14:53.943
and they'll be far less likely to
get involved in, shall we say,

14:53.983 --> 14:58.263
less socially acceptable
activities.

15:06.503 --> 15:08.983
What a dump.

15:09.023 --> 15:12.263
This is perfect.
It's a pile of shit.

15:12.303 --> 15:15.863
With a tonne of potential, Susan.
Rome started with less.

15:17.863 --> 15:20.983
You're gonna have to get all these
tools checked and recertified.

15:21.023 --> 15:24.903
How long will that take? I could get
the prison sparky to fast-track it.

15:24.943 --> 15:26.703
Depends on how badly you want it.

15:41.343 --> 15:43.063
She's thinking about it.

15:45.063 --> 15:46.623
Turn.

15:50.543 --> 15:53.143
Not good enough.

15:53.183 --> 15:55.983
Persuade her.

15:56.023 --> 16:01.103
Use that, um, charm thing.

16:01.143 --> 16:04.023
And one other thing.

16:04.063 --> 16:05.823
Get Nurse Radcliffe in your corner.

16:07.503 --> 16:09.383
Bind her to us.

16:09.423 --> 16:11.263
And how the fuck am I supposed to
do that?

16:11.303 --> 16:19.303
Fuck!

16:27.183 --> 16:31.463
Oh, yeah.

16:34.823 --> 16:37.823
Don't come inside me.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.800
Oh, shit. Vera.
Sorry.

16:48.840 --> 16:52.520
Uh, how are you?
Exhausted.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.056
I was up half the night trying to figure
out what to get you for your birthday.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.720
You are, without a doubt,

16:56.760 --> 16:57.856
the hardest person I've
ever had to buy for.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.040
No, I told you, no presents.
I hate them.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.640
What is it with
you and birthdays?

17:02.680 --> 17:05.839
Look I, um... I actually
had a sleepless night, too.

17:09.160 --> 17:13.119
I've decided I'm not ready
to go the next step. Not yet.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.440
I value my independence.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.319
Are you angry?

17:19.359 --> 17:21.480
I could never be angry with you.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.680
I am a bit disappointed but, uh, I'm

17:25.720 --> 17:27.800
not going to throw
myself under a bus.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.080
Um, thank you for understanding.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.280
Oh, well, a challenge is good.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.120
Alright!

17:51.160 --> 17:53.960
This is Ted.
He's from the local TAFE.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.880
He's going to help
supervise, aren't you, Ted?

17:55.920 --> 17:58.880
Anyone here know how to weld?
Yep, I do.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.120
OK, show us.

18:14.440 --> 18:18.600
Whoa! No, stop! What the... What are
you doing? Nobody touch the machine.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.360
Oh, really? Really?
What, couldn't you hear that?

18:21.400 --> 18:25.240
Her feed's too high, her power's too
low. She's like machine-gunning it.

18:26.480 --> 18:30.320
Look at that bead.
That... that's shit. It's shit.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.560
Shut up.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.120
Do you know how to weld, Susan?

18:38.160 --> 18:41.560
Iman, this is H5,
and you're up the end here.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.160
Doesn't look like much, but you've
got a telly,

18:48.200 --> 18:51.360
you can decorate it with photos,
whatever.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.160
I'll leave you to it.

19:00.120 --> 19:03.160
She said no.
Values her independence.

19:03.200 --> 19:06.800
A lie. Vera is massively insecure.

19:06.840 --> 19:11.200
Deep down, she feels unworthy.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.680
I'm sure you could do
something with that.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.840
You're hanging around
here a lot, Mr Stewart.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.080
You want me, don't ya?

19:24.120 --> 19:27.360
Yeah.
Like a dose of the clap, Gambaro.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.800
Stella might oblige.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.000
Get fucked.

19:30.040 --> 19:33.440
You've got a new inmate. Iman Farah.
Make her feel welcome.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.360
Hello, hello.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.920
I'm Juicy Lucy.

19:45.960 --> 19:50.240
And I love caramel milkshake.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.400
You stay the fuck away from me.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.840
Oh, Stell, we got a wildcat.
Yeah.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.080
You'll keep.

20:07.760 --> 20:10.120
I don't need all this stuff, alright?
I don't...

20:10.160 --> 20:12.840
Shut up. Susan here is an expert.

20:12.880 --> 20:16.920
I want everyone to listen to
exactly what she has to say.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.720
So, like, when you mig weld,
right...

20:25.240 --> 20:27.680
the first thing is, well, you
gotta get your settings right.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.680
Idiot.

20:29.720 --> 20:34.000
Yeah, nah, and then you gotta,
like, make sure you push the gun

20:34.040 --> 20:37.240
at the right angle so you
get the right-size filler.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.960
Isn't it, Ted?
Yes, that's correct.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.840
Yeah, that's right.

20:40.880 --> 20:46.080
Yeah. Um, so you don't get,
like, that crunchy holey shit?

20:46.120 --> 20:48.360
You know, the...
I'll just show ya, alright?

20:48.400 --> 20:50.200
Yeah, just show us.
Get the screen, Ted.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.120
OK. Eyes.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.520
Oh, fuck!
You've gotta go to the dentist.

21:39.560 --> 21:45.520
I am tomorrow. Stop sounding
like a broken fuckin' record.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.360
Oh.

21:49.480 --> 21:50.880
Far out.

21:50.920 --> 21:54.440
You know, if you were Top Dog, you'd have
more than chocolate bars to munch on.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.280
You could have a whole candy store.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.640
Gob-stoppers, all-day suckers.

22:08.080 --> 22:11.160
Little fresh liquorice bullet.

22:17.400 --> 22:20.360
How the fuck am I
gonna be Top Dog?

22:20.400 --> 22:22.840
Most of these
snatches hate me guts.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.800
Popularity isn't all
it's cracked up to be.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.800
Look at Kaz. Democracy isn't
really working for her, is it?

22:28.840 --> 22:32.440
There are two ways
to rule the rabble.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.880
You can try to
appeal to the people...

22:36.880 --> 22:38.080
or you can terrify them.

23:02.240 --> 23:03.640
Are you Doreen?

23:07.520 --> 23:10.360
Someone told me
you're a peer worker.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.920
That's right.
My name's Iman.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.960
I'm here on remand.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.720
I need some legal help.
That's what your lawyer's for.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.840
My lawyer's shit. Public defender.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.560
He doesn't give a damn
about a woman like me.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.680
Here, have a seat.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.480
Iman, was it?

23:33.520 --> 23:35.840
I don't know what to do.

23:35.880 --> 23:40.000
I don't want to spend time in here for
something that wasn't my fault, you know?

23:40.040 --> 23:43.880
I've been here five
seconds, I already hate it.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.880
You get used to it.
I don't wanna get used to it.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.640
I wanna get the fuck out of here.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.160
I know how you feel.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.960
What are they, six to eight?

24:01.000 --> 24:04.960
And what'd I say? Three to four,
that's right. So start again.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.800
Yeah, right.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.320
Another three of those.
Susan!

24:13.360 --> 24:15.120
Oh, do you need to
go to the dunny again?

24:15.160 --> 24:18.600
No, no, no. I think I can take care
of my own ablutions from now on.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.240
Hey? I have need of you
in a different way.

24:21.280 --> 24:23.360
I want you to take
charge of this project.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.480
No, you... you're in charge.

24:25.520 --> 24:29.440
I can't do this without you.
I want us to be a team.

24:38.800 --> 24:42.880
Oh, so close.
Can I join you for one?

24:42.920 --> 24:46.240
Yeah. Sure.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.560
My name's Joan.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.240
I'm in your unit.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.520
I'd kind of like to, uh, take this
opportunity to apologise

24:56.560 --> 24:58.480
for the crude behaviour of one
of our neighbours.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.400
Lucy.

25:02.440 --> 25:05.200
She's, uh...

25:05.240 --> 25:07.200
Well, she is a pig.

25:07.240 --> 25:10.160
But she's also a very useful ally.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.960
As leader of the boys,
she's the one who decides

25:14.000 --> 25:16.760
who is or is not, a sexual
target around this place.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.800
I've got no interest in that shit.

25:18.840 --> 25:23.080
Me neither, which is why I went out of
my way to befriend Lucy and her crew,

25:23.120 --> 25:27.080
despite certain run-ins
we have had in the past.

25:27.120 --> 25:30.480
If you want my advice - and you
may not - but if you do,

25:30.520 --> 25:33.040
might be a good idea for you to do
the same.

25:33.080 --> 25:34.600
Ahh, speak of the devil.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.840
Lucy, meet, um...

25:36.880 --> 25:39.840
Iman.
..Iman. This is Lucy.

25:39.880 --> 25:43.160
Sorry about before, love.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.400
I was only mucking around.

25:50.560 --> 25:54.680
Hey, Luce, why don't you ask Iman if she's
given any thought to joining a crew?

25:54.720 --> 25:57.000
Hey, smell this.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.040
What?
Just smell it.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.520
Booms!
Just smell it!

25:59.560 --> 26:02.840
It's gross! What is that?

26:02.880 --> 26:06.120
That is the smell of success.
Oh, is it?

26:06.160 --> 26:07.176
Yeah. Yeah.
Or is it a bit of minge?

26:07.200 --> 26:08.760
Now smell that.
Oh, don't!

26:08.800 --> 26:13.480
Shut up. Smell it. Smell it!
Oi, Franky. Franky! Ferguson's

26:13.520 --> 26:15.440
trying to get her claws in Iman.
What?

26:15.480 --> 26:18.640
Who's Yorman? She's a newbie
and she needs protection.

26:18.680 --> 26:21.600
Ferguson and Lucy are going for her.
Well, that's Kaz's problem,

26:21.640 --> 26:24.320
not mine.
Kaz won't do anything.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.640
Are you just gonna sit
there and let it happen?

26:28.560 --> 26:31.960
Why don't you make Iman
a cup of tea, Lucy?

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
Show her real,
proper H5 hospitality?

26:35.040 --> 26:38.920
Oh, sure, sure. Yep.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.600
How do you take it?
White. One sugar.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.840
I usually take mine
with a spot of milk, too.

26:43.880 --> 26:48.360
But today, I'm taking mine black.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.400
Go on, get her in there.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.200
Oh, shut her up! Get her on the bed.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.240
Black, white, yellow.

27:03.280 --> 27:06.480
We're all pink where it counts,
darlin'.

27:06.520 --> 27:09.920
You know why they call me Juicy?

27:09.960 --> 27:12.800
'Cause I'm gonna squirt all
over your pretty little face.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.000
Go on, Juice, go for it.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.920
Yeah, get in there.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.960
Shut her up!

27:28.640 --> 27:30.360
Oh, it doesn't hurt, does it?

27:32.640 --> 27:35.560
Now you back off,
or do you wanna go another round?

27:35.600 --> 27:39.720
Fuck. My tooth! Oh, fuck!

27:39.760 --> 27:42.040
Alright, ya piece of shit.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.800
You OK?
What the hell's going on, Anderson?

27:45.840 --> 27:47.520
Have a look for
yourself, Mr Jackson.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.120
Doyle?

27:49.160 --> 27:52.880
Why don't you ask the Juice, Mr J?

27:52.920 --> 27:56.800
Oh, fuck.
You're all gonna fuckin' keep!

27:56.840 --> 27:59.200
Tidy yourself up, Gambaro.
You're coming with me.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.696
I didn't do nothin', Mr Jackson.
Let's go.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.680
It was Doyle.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.360
She attacked my cavity.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.880
Mr Jackson's got it in for me,
Ms Bennett.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.120
OK.
I knocked him back once...

28:10.160 --> 28:12.440
OK... and he's been sinking
his boots into me ever since.

28:12.480 --> 28:16.240
Enough! Enough, Gambaro. I am
suspending your privileges for a month.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.296
If you so much as touch
another inmate, it'll be the slot.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.960
Vinegar Tits.
What'd you say?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.416
I said, it won't
happen again, Ms Bennett.

28:22.440 --> 28:23.640
See that it doesn't.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.720
Lucy's getting out of hand.

28:31.760 --> 28:35.520
The new prisoner, assign her to
the laundry. Keep her close to Kaz.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.040
You sure you don't
want me to do that?

28:44.080 --> 28:46.920
What do you think?
Are you alright, love?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.280
Hey, Kaz.

28:52.200 --> 28:53.800
You hear about Lucy?

28:53.840 --> 28:55.480
She just attacked a newbie.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.736
She would have raped her if Franky
and Boomer hadn't stopped her.

28:57.760 --> 29:00.520
You refused to put Lucy in her
place and now look what's happened.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.120
You women are fucked in the head.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.760
What is wrong with you?

29:06.800 --> 29:07.880
You don't get it, do you?

29:07.920 --> 29:10.520
By bashing each other, you're
only hurting yourselves.

29:10.560 --> 29:13.160
I'm wasting my fucking time.

29:15.480 --> 29:18.080
I'm telling you, I'm sick to
death of all of this bullshit.

29:18.120 --> 29:22.520
I'm fuckin' sick and tired of it.

29:34.735 --> 29:37.135
OK, Proctor, come with me.

29:41.895 --> 29:43.335
Where are you taking me?

29:50.615 --> 29:53.815
Are you losing control of the women?

29:53.855 --> 29:57.615
You know Gambaro just
terrorised the new inmate.

29:57.655 --> 30:00.255
And we both knew she was
responsible for Stevens's bashing.

30:02.615 --> 30:06.615
You need to take control, Proctor.
Take some action.

30:07.775 --> 30:09.655
What are you
suggesting, Governor?

30:09.695 --> 30:12.615
Gambaro's making you look weak.

30:12.655 --> 30:18.375
Are you giving me permission
to bash Lucy?

30:50.375 --> 30:52.495
You look happy.

30:52.535 --> 30:54.815
I am.

30:58.215 --> 31:01.135
You know, amidst all
the bullshit that's been going on,

31:01.175 --> 31:04.415
I kind of forgot...

31:06.935 --> 31:08.615
that you're the victim here.

31:09.855 --> 31:12.935
If you ask me to, I'll bash Lucy.

31:17.655 --> 31:19.735
I would love you to do that.

31:21.615 --> 31:25.295
But, speaking as someone who
knows just a thing or two about

31:25.335 --> 31:27.455
leadership,

31:27.495 --> 31:31.415
it's a sign of weakness to betray
your publicly-stated principles.

31:35.615 --> 31:37.615
Thank you, Sonia.

31:41.175 --> 31:42.615
Ooh!

31:42.655 --> 31:44.975
Um, what were you after again?

31:45.015 --> 31:48.455
Paracetamol.
My new filling's starting to ache.

31:51.375 --> 31:53.215
Open. Tongue.

31:58.095 --> 32:01.175
"Oh, don't cum inside me."

32:03.455 --> 32:05.535
Somebody's been a naughty nurse.

32:06.455 --> 32:08.575
Don't worry.

32:08.615 --> 32:10.375
I won't tell.

32:18.615 --> 32:20.135
Happy birthday, Vera.

32:29.135 --> 32:31.655
Why don't you like birthdays?

32:35.175 --> 32:37.455
Ahh, my mother always made a
point of forgetting them.

32:39.655 --> 32:43.495
As if she didn't want me to feel
special, on any day.

32:47.535 --> 32:50.575
When I was nine, she let me have
my first birthday party

32:50.615 --> 32:55.615
and, um... I spent weeks planning it.

32:57.055 --> 32:58.735
Sent out the invites.

33:01.815 --> 33:06.095
And she cancelled it,
the day before, without telling me.

33:07.255 --> 33:08.975
So I stood at the door,

33:11.495 --> 33:14.375
in my party clothes,

33:14.415 --> 33:16.695
and, um, I waited for...

33:21.815 --> 33:23.975
And she told me no-one
came because...

33:30.935 --> 33:33.335
because nobody liked me.

33:41.335 --> 33:43.055
I'm saving your pressie for later.

33:46.255 --> 33:48.135
Haven't wrapped it yet.

33:50.415 --> 33:51.495
Nearly done?

33:51.535 --> 33:53.415
I have to go set
up for the dentist.

33:53.455 --> 33:54.935
OK. I'll walk Proctor back.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.535
What are you going
to do about Lucy?

33:59.575 --> 34:01.135
They're still making noises.

34:01.175 --> 34:03.095
You know what? Let her make noises.

34:03.135 --> 34:04.815
I'm going to stick to my principles.

34:04.855 --> 34:08.455
It's far more important than
making an example out of Lucy.

34:08.495 --> 34:10.455
OK, I get it.

34:10.495 --> 34:12.935
But if you stuff this up,
Kaz, and you get this wrong

34:12.975 --> 34:16.215
and the wrong person steps up, then
the women have no chance in hell.

34:31.295 --> 34:32.655
Well?

34:33.375 --> 34:37.655
I think I'm winning the battle,
slowly but surely.

34:37.695 --> 34:41.495
She really opened up to me before.
Vera's mum sabotaged her party.

34:41.534 --> 34:43.110
Sounds like she's
never quite gotten over it.

34:43.135 --> 34:46.375
It gives us the perfect
opportunity to close the deal.

34:46.415 --> 34:49.135
Yeah.
Now, birthday cake.

34:49.175 --> 34:51.215
In the staff room.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.534
Make it special.

34:59.015 --> 35:01.295
Gambaro put in a
request to see you, Governor.

35:01.335 --> 35:04.375
Ahh, yes. Thank you, Ms Miles.

35:07.775 --> 35:10.231
If you're here to make more
bogus accusations about Mr Jackson,

35:10.255 --> 35:13.135
you're wasting my time.
I got a proposition, Governor.

35:13.175 --> 35:17.655
I've got some information to offer.
OK, what kind of information?

35:17.695 --> 35:22.615
Information of a very personal
nature, regarding yourself.

35:27.535 --> 35:29.535
But I want something in return.

35:31.815 --> 35:33.095
What?

35:33.135 --> 35:36.855
I want you to support
my bid for Top Dog.

35:39.455 --> 35:40.935
Are you serious?

35:40.975 --> 35:42.335
Mm-hm.

35:42.375 --> 35:45.215
You? Top Dog!

35:46.975 --> 35:49.615
You'd be the...
Sorry, you'd be the worst Top Dog

35:49.655 --> 35:52.095
in the history of Wentworth!

35:52.135 --> 35:59.535
Oh, Ms Miles!
Ms M... Um, I think we're done.

35:59.575 --> 36:02.015
You've reached Don Kaplan.
I'm not available at the moment...

36:02.055 --> 36:03.935
Oh, fuck!

36:03.975 --> 36:05.895
Shut the fuck up and listen.
Get off me!

36:05.935 --> 36:09.295
You'd better get Sonia to
start forking over the cash,

36:09.335 --> 36:11.575
or that bashing I gave
her'll be just foreplay.

36:11.615 --> 36:16.935
Next time, I will gang the bitch
and tell her you're that Witness X.

36:19.695 --> 36:21.975
Now, how's that
fuckin' ticker of yours?

36:28.455 --> 36:31.935
Hey, Ms Westfall! I need a word.
Not now, Liz.

36:31.975 --> 36:34.935
Fuck, I was right about Juice
Gambaro. She knows I'm Witness X.

36:34.975 --> 36:37.655
She just threatened me and she
said she was gonna tell Sonia.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.655
OK, calm down.
Oh, fuck, I wish you people would

36:39.695 --> 36:42.215
stop telling me to calm down!
Just take a few deep breaths.

36:42.255 --> 36:44.551
No, I don't need deep breaths.
I don't want to go for a walk.

36:44.575 --> 36:45.871
Go for a walk and at 3:00,
we'll talk then, OK?

36:45.895 --> 36:49.135
That could be too late, Ms Westfall.
You've got to shut Juice up now.

36:49.175 --> 36:51.575
- Look, I can't. There's somewhere I've got to be, OK?
- 00.

36:51.615 --> 36:52.815
I promise, Liz, I promise.

36:55.135 --> 36:57.215
Fuck!

36:58.215 --> 36:59.295
Fuck.

37:00.535 --> 37:02.815
Well, can't you get
maintenance onto it?

37:02.855 --> 37:05.311
Well, it's not that simple. I really
think you need to check this out.

37:05.335 --> 37:12.415
Surprise!

37:27.415 --> 37:29.335
What happened?

37:45.935 --> 37:47.415
Hey, what's wrong?

37:56.535 --> 37:58.495
Why do you like me?

37:58.535 --> 38:06.535
What?
I'm pathetic. I'm... Vinegar Tits.

38:07.295 --> 38:12.695
Oh, Vera, you are...
You're wonderful.

38:12.735 --> 38:14.135
I'm not.
Yes.

38:14.175 --> 38:17.655
I'm not. I'm... I'm... God,
what's everyone going to think?

38:17.695 --> 38:19.575
I'm sorry about the cake thing.

38:19.615 --> 38:24.095
I just... Oh, shit, it's my fault.
I just wanted you to feel special.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.295
I do. I do feel special.

38:31.855 --> 38:35.095
When I'm around you, I...

38:43.855 --> 38:46.015
Would you come over tonight, please?

38:52.855 --> 38:54.055
Bring your suitcase.

38:58.815 --> 38:59.895
OK.

39:38.775 --> 39:40.735
You'd better not be doing it.
Don't be stupid.

39:40.775 --> 39:42.535
Get in the chair.

39:54.335 --> 39:58.135
Oh! Give me some fucking gas,
ya twat!

39:58.175 --> 39:59.975
Lift.

40:12.895 --> 40:14.615
I'll let the dentist
know you're ready.

40:14.655 --> 40:16.135
Yeah, right.

41:52.575 --> 41:54.615
You've licked your last pussy.

42:13.255 --> 42:15.415
Sh! Sh!

42:25.295 --> 42:29.255
To achieve this in just two days
is testament

42:29.295 --> 42:33.575
not only to the Governor's
willingness to put her faith in me,

42:33.615 --> 42:37.655
but to the skill and dedication of
my second-in-command,

42:37.695 --> 42:40.815
Susan Jenkins.
Boomer!

42:40.855 --> 42:45.535
Susan! Oh, look at
her, she's gonna cry.

42:45.575 --> 42:46.935
Would you do the honours?

42:46.975 --> 42:48.055
Oh, yeah, I'll...

42:48.095 --> 42:51.175
Behold... the Green Wall!

42:54.055 --> 42:56.215
Oh, yes!

42:57.335 --> 42:58.895
Come on, everyone.

42:58.935 --> 43:00.975
This is an amazing achievement,

43:01.015 --> 43:03.815
you know, making something
like... like that. It's a...

43:05.095 --> 43:09.615
Well, it's not just a living garden
on a wall, it is a work of art.

43:09.655 --> 43:11.615
How about showing some real
appreciation?

43:21.615 --> 43:24.855
Oh, fuck! What's that?
Shit!

43:27.655 --> 43:28.895
What the fuck?

43:42.495 --> 43:46.535
Attention, compound. This is a
Code Black. Code Black!

43:46.575 --> 43:48.615
All prisoners return
to their units.

43:52.875 --> 43:54.795
Ambulance is on its way.

43:57.755 --> 44:00.795
Vera. Vera?

44:00.835 --> 44:02.395
What's happened?

44:05.155 --> 44:07.675
Lucy Gambaro.

44:07.715 --> 44:10.795
Someone cut her tongue out.
What?

44:10.835 --> 44:13.715
She was seeing the dentist.

44:13.755 --> 44:15.995
Nurse Radcliffe went to get him.
When she came back,

44:16.035 --> 44:18.755
Gambaro was gone, there was
blood everywhere. Who did this?

44:18.795 --> 44:21.915
Could it have been Liz?
Li... Birdsworth?

44:21.955 --> 44:24.315
She came to me this morning.
She was in a state

44:24.355 --> 44:26.475
and she said that Lucy knew
that she was Witness X.

44:30.715 --> 44:31.875
Who did this to you?

44:33.435 --> 44:35.355
Who did this? Was it Ferguson?

44:35.395 --> 44:36.995
Just nod. Was it...

44:37.035 --> 44:38.795
It's OK. Was it Ferguson?

44:39.875 --> 44:41.355
OK.

44:45.235 --> 44:47.595
You were going to tell me something.

44:47.635 --> 44:48.915
What were you going to tell me?

44:48.955 --> 44:51.515
What is it you know about me?

44:51.555 --> 44:53.515
OK, write it down.
Tell me. Tell me.

44:53.555 --> 44:56.395
What do you know about me?
Write it down.

45:03.835 --> 45:04.995
Ambulance is here.

45:32.115 --> 45:35.915
Ferguson took out
the trash when Kaz couldn't.

45:35.955 --> 45:37.235
Yeah, fuck Kaz!

45:37.275 --> 45:41.555
What's she done for us?
Top Dog.

45:41.595 --> 45:45.115
Get off!
Top Dog.

45:45.155 --> 45:52.115
Piss off!
Top Dog! Top Dog! Top Dog!

45:52.155 --> 45:54.275
Get off!
Top Dog!

45:54.315 --> 45:57.235
Oh, shut up!
Top Dog!

45:57.275 --> 46:05.275
Top Dog! Top Dog! Top Dog! Top Dog!
Top Dog! Top Dog! Top Dog! Top Dog!

47:20.795 --> 47:23.315
Oh, fuck! Oh!

48:27.875 --> 48:31.355
Do you mind if I open
it tomorrow?

48:51.355 --> 48:53.675
I feel safe with you.
