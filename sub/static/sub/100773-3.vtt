What do you want to discuss?

40:45.804 --> 40:49.762

to do this here.

restraining order

40:57.929 --> 40:59.887
blocking you from getting
your apartment

40:59.970 --> 41:02.804
was...a bit of
an overreach.

41:02.887 --> 41:04.762
But I was merely
reacting to--

41:04.845 --> 41:07.387
I know: my releasing
the statement.

41:07.470 --> 41:08.637
Which I wouldn't have done

41:08.720 --> 41:10.762
if you hadn't dragged
your goddamned feet.

41:10.845 --> 41:15.136

accepting our status.

41:15.220 --> 41:16.595

41:16.679 --> 41:19.595

43:44.929 --> 43:47.553
We just have to run the trade

Before the funds land with us,

we can designate them.
