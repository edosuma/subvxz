Hey, sport!

00:04.630 --> 00:06.506

got engaged, you dog !

00:06.590 --> 00:07.715
Yeah.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.676
(GROANS) God !

00:09.760 --> 00:11.135
Nothing can

(DOOR CLOSES)

00:17.017 --> 00:19.435
l was there,
and that dude
is not engaged.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.437
l'm not a big believer
in therapy,

00:21.522 --> 00:23.940
but l would go
into my own pocket
to cover his copay.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.192
Big idea,
double wedding !

00:26.276 --> 00:27.527
Me, Angela, you, Holly.

00:27.611 --> 00:28.986
No. We would never do that.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.697
And if we did,
it would be with
Jim and Pam.

00:30.781 --> 00:31.781
Yeah, we'd never
do that.

00:31.865 --> 00:32.865
Yeah, so there you go.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.701
Michael, l got
my bridesmaid's dress.

00:34.785 --> 00:35.910
Wow, so quickly.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.036
Yeah, and you said
l could get it

00:37.121 --> 00:38.788
in any color l wanted,
so l picked white.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.374
Michael, did you tell
your mom yet?

00:41.917 --> 00:43.209
Nope. Nope, not yet.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.544
Why not?
You wouldn't tell your mom?

00:44.628 --> 00:46.129
You love your mom.
MlCHAEL: Yeah, l do.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.213
Call your mom, Michael.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.507
Yeah, l'll call her
and tell her tomorrow.

00:49.633 --> 00:53.720
ALL: Call her! Call her!
l don't wanna
do it in public.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.888
All right,
l will call her.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.640
She is going to
freak out!

MICHAEL'S MOM: HeIIo?

01:04.189 --> 01:05.440
Mom, l'm getting married.

01:05.524 --> 01:06.524
No, you're not.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.359
Why do you always do that?

01:08.736 --> 01:12.697
Whenever l'm getting married,
you don't believe me.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.491
Are you getting married?

01:15.826 --> 01:16.868
No.

01:17.161 --> 01:18.578
(LAUGHS)

01:19.121 --> 01:20.079
Are you...

01:20.164 --> 01:22.123
l'm not.
l'm not getting married.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.255
Psych.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.446
So l've returned
my bridesmaid dress

01:53.530 --> 01:56.699
and it was on sale,
so l'm out
a hundred dollars.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.035
And l'm out a fiancee.

01:59.578 --> 02:00.787
Are those
the customer surveys?

02:00.871 --> 02:04.624
Yeah, this is all of them.
Jim, Dwight,

to my bridesmaid dress.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.007
What's that doing there?

02:13.091 --> 02:16.427
l'll take care of that
for you. Thanks.

02:17.387 --> 02:22.475
Kelly Kapoor
is our dusky, exotic,
customer service rep.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.645
And once a year,
she will contact
our clients

02:25.729 --> 02:28.898
and find out
how happy they are
with our sales people.

02:28.982 --> 02:32.151
Sort of a "Kapoor's List."
SchindIer's List parody.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.405
That's not appropriate. No.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.075
Those reports
affect our bonuses,

02:39.159 --> 02:40.868
which is kind of
great for me,

02:40.953 --> 02:43.621
because you wouldn't know
from looking at her,

02:43.705 --> 02:44.997
but Pam's a gold digger.

02:45.082 --> 02:48.000
PAM OVER EARPHONE:
Hey, New York ain't free.
Get back to work.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.338
lt's the world's
tiniest Bluetooth.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.341
l found it in
a Japanese gadget store
in the Village.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.218
l got one for Jim, too.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.344
Jim, say something.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.054
JIM: Testing, testing,
heIIo, everybody.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.556
We wanted to stay
on the phone all day,

03:01.640 --> 03:04.725
but the company has a policy
against
eight-hour personal calls,

03:04.810 --> 03:06.727
so we're not
telling anyone.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.855
Pam, what do you
want on your coffee?

03:08.939 --> 03:11.357
Sprinkle of cinnamon.
JIM: SprinkIe of cinnamon.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.567
l should go.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.361
All righty, Dwighty,
let's see how you did.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.071
Bring it on.
No.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.322
Sorry.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.157
Wow.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.284
What does it say?

03:23.453 --> 03:25.663
Dwight,
your feedback
is horrible.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.623
That's impossible.
A number of your clients

03:27.708 --> 03:30.543
found your personal style
abrasive and distasteful.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.712
l sell more paper
than anyone.
No, no, no, no.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.463
Wait, is this a joke?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.716
l'm getting that
queasy feeling that
sometimes accompanies jokes.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.134
Do l look like
l am joking?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.511
No, but that's
sometimes part of it.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.096
lf l were joking,
you'd be laughing.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.848
Do you look like
you are laughing?

03:43.932 --> 03:46.183
lmpossible to say,
l can't see myself.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.310
You're not.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.146
Yo, Tommy Tuna.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.606
Did you get
your scores yet?

03:51.690 --> 03:52.815
No.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.859
l got mine,
they were really good.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.193
l miss him.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.528
You must be really proud.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.405
Yeah, l'm pretty psyched.
Whoa!

03:59.489 --> 04:00.990
That's my mug.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.118
Sorry, l was just. . .
lt was right here.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.244
Right. Well,

04:05.329 --> 04:08.539
it's mine, so
if you could pour it out
and get another one.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.958
Okay, or maybe l could
finish the coffee
that's in here,

04:11.043 --> 04:13.002
and you could use. . .

04:14.004 --> 04:15.338
Snoopy! He's funny.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.131
Don't give him Snoopy.
That's mine!

04:18.800 --> 04:22.261
That is a great mug,
but it's not my mug.

04:22.346 --> 04:25.598
That is my mug,
so give it back.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.433
How can you even be sure?

04:27.517 --> 04:29.685
That's my face on it.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.395
Make the face.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.147
l don't see it.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.857
Dude, that is my face.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.526
PAM: What was that?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.570
Wow. That was Dwight.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.030
He seems upset
about something.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.448
Describe him exactly.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.117
What color mustard
is his shirt,
yellow or Dijon?

04:45.202 --> 04:47.954
lt is spicy brown, actually.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.288
What are you
mumbling about?

04:49.373 --> 04:50.498
How was your meeting
with Michael?

04:50.582 --> 04:51.666
None of your business.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.750
Was it your scores?

04:52.834 --> 04:55.044
These can't be
my scores, Jim.

04:55.587 --> 04:58.589
For your information,
l'm being sabotaged.

04:58.674 --> 04:59.674
Of course.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.801
And l'm gonna
find that person
and punish them.

05:01.885 --> 05:02.843
Absolutely.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.388
Or you could just be
nice to your customers.

05:05.931 --> 05:06.931
You're an idiot.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.182
There's the charm.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.393
Jimbo, let's do this thing.

05:11.895 --> 05:12.853
That is me.
Wish me luck.

05:12.938 --> 05:13.980
No way.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.272
PAM: Good Iuck.
Thanks.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.774
l didn't say anything.
I Iove you.

05:16.858 --> 05:17.817
l love you, too.

What do you think
l'm saying to you?

05:20.487 --> 05:22.405
l'm not talking to you.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.533
l caught Jim
talking to himself
several times today.

05:25.617 --> 05:26.909
What a loser.

it's really gorgeous.

and third weddings.

to do the same design,
but with walls of gray?

that's gray, too?

what we can find out
from reading.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.428
Jim Halpert is

And there is
our smudgeness.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.811
l need a decent bonus

06:35.896 --> 06:39.065
because l'm actually
in the process of
buying my parents' house

06:39.483 --> 06:41.442
so that they can retire.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.904

tells us anything,
it's that you can't go wrong

you can't afford.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.004
on my customer
reviews this year.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.422

spent the whole year

to go away, Kelly.

come to my party,

and then you
didn't even show up,

to come to my place.

why l make it
in such great quantities.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.131
Here's what
we're going to do.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.341
We are going to
sit here for a while,

17:31.426 --> 17:33.343
make it look good.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.303
And maybe you should cry.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.722
Can you make yourself cry?

17:36.806 --> 17:37.764
No problem.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.975
l think
you should do that.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.185
(SOBBlNG LOUDLY)

17:43.771 --> 17:44.938
(LAUGHlNG)

17:45.022 --> 17:46.189
(LAUGHS)

17:55.658 --> 17:57.617
Pam Beesly?

17:57.702 --> 17:59.870
Hey. What are
you doing here?

17:59.954 --> 18:00.996
Who's that?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.372
lt's Alex.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.959
lt's Pam.
l came to kidnap you.

18:06.043 --> 18:09.171
There's free wine and cheese
at the Chuck Close
retrospective. Let's go.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.715
That's going to be great.
Who's Chuck Close?

18:11.966 --> 18:15.010
l love Chuck Close
and his
photorealist paintings.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.344
But I have to work.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.098
Well, actually,
there's something else

18:20.183 --> 18:22.601
l'd love to
talk to you about.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.520
Can we go somewhere
else to talk about it?

18:26.606 --> 18:27.689
Okay.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.316
That's it.
l want to talk to this guy.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.650
Put me in his ear.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.694
What's up?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.362
l want to take a big leap.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.948
And l want to tell you
that l think that
you should not

18:37.033 --> 18:39.117
move back to Scranton.

18:39.202 --> 18:40.243
Wow.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.120
l want to make
a bigger leap here.

18:42.205 --> 18:43.622
He is into you.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.166
Why did you come to New York
in the first place?

18:46.250 --> 18:47.876
Because they have
a great design program,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.462
and l wanted to see
if l was any good at it.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.464
And l wanted to
work on my art, too.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.548
Right.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.509
And that's why l think
you should stay here.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.094
Because, l mean,
you really
just got here,

18:58.179 --> 19:01.097
you know, and you
can't do New York
in three months.

19:01.182 --> 19:04.726
You know, it has everything.
All the opportunity is here,

19:05.019 --> 19:07.312
all the. . .
The whole art scene
is in New York.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.189
You know, it would be nuts
to go back to Scranton

19:09.273 --> 19:11.733
without getting to
fuIIy experience it.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.819
Jim's in Scranton.

19:13.903 --> 19:14.945
l know, but. . .

19:15.571 --> 19:19.032
All l'm saying is,
if there's even
a teeny, tiny part of you

19:19.116 --> 19:21.284
that really wants
to be an artist,

19:21.369 --> 19:23.995
then l think
you should stay here,
because you don't want

19:24.080 --> 19:26.289
to wake up in 50 years

19:26.374 --> 19:29.292
and look back
and wonder
what could have been.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.004
And that is
the end of my speech.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.465
I pIanned it aII.
Anyway...

19:36.092 --> 19:37.050
l will see you tomorrow.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.261
l'll see you tomorrow.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.316
ls that the
Matsahashi B-400?

19:53.401 --> 19:55.026
The world's
tiniest Bluetooth.

19:57.405 --> 19:58.905
May l?
Don't.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.202
Congratulations on
choosing Schrute Farms
for your wedding.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.955
No, we haven't
decided
on anything yet.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.583
We're still
reviewing some options

20:09.667 --> 20:11.209
and it's going to
come down
to the numbers.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.921
Well, then,
why don't you look over
some of our materials,

20:16.632 --> 20:19.634
while l describe to you
the Excalibur package.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.720
ln addition to
the breathtaking
natural beauty

20:21.804 --> 20:23.847
and smell
of Schrute Farms,

20:23.931 --> 20:26.141
l can promise you
that our grounds
can be catered

20:26.225 --> 20:28.935
to fit your
exact specifications.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.898
l will work tirelessly
for you
over the coming months

20:33.524 --> 20:35.567
and be at your
constant disposal.

20:35.651 --> 20:40.155
Please feel free
to call or stop by
any time of the day or night.

20:41.324 --> 20:42.324
That's very generous.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.700
Well, you,
my good friend,

20:43.784 --> 20:44.868
have nothing more
to worry about.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.287
This wedding
is officially
out of your hands.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.581
Thank the good Lord. Deal !

20:49.665 --> 20:50.749
Okay.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.834
What are we
talking pricewise?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.294
You already said,
"Deal."

20:54.378 --> 20:55.921
Pay him
whatever he wants.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.672
Can't argue with that.

20:59.342 --> 21:00.508
Dwight,

21:03.846 --> 21:06.306
you are going to
make us so happy.
