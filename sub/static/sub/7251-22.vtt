00:07.741 --> 00:09.655
Oh, hi! Great!

00:09.793 --> 00:12.767
I'm still on my finals sleep schedule, and, man, am I wired.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.329
What time is it? Like, 3:00 in the morning? I cannot tell anymore.

00:15.473 --> 00:19.829
Want some mac and cheese? I love mac and cheese when I can't sleep.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.512
Cool. Individual cheese slices.

00:22.670 --> 00:26.131
So, I've been making out my résumé so I can try to get a summer job,

00:26.182 --> 00:30.647
because there is no way that I am going to swipe cafeteria cards again next year.

00:30.889 --> 00:31.795
My whites are done.

00:32.223 --> 00:35.645
Do you know that the best time to do your laundry at Yale is in the middle of the night?

00:35.798 --> 00:38.179
You have your pick of washers, the place has just been swept,

00:38.239 --> 00:41.287
and the trash is completely empty. So, what do you think?

00:41.395 --> 00:45.759
The Stars Hollow Gazette needs a facts checker, but Rob's Tire is offering way more money.

00:45.839 --> 00:50.334
I know that now is the time to suffer for my art, but I was so broke by the end of the year

00:50.396 --> 00:52.781
that I had to dip into Paris' green tea stash,

00:52.838 --> 00:55.085
which backfired on so many levels, I can't even tell you.

01:02.541 --> 01:04.312
Great to have you home, hon.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074

02:01.422 --> 02:03.622
Okay, I think I've got all the rooms assigned for the test run.

02:03.695 --> 02:06.434
- Hit me. 
- Miss Patty is in room one, Babette is in two.

02:06.485 --> 02:10.181
I put Taylor in three, the corner room. The Siegels will go in five,

02:10.247 --> 02:13.003
- you and Rory are in six... 
- Wait, what happened to four?

02:13.074 --> 02:13.843
Four is taken.

02:14.503 --> 02:15.973
- By whom? 
- By friends of mine.

02:16.090 --> 02:18.244
- Sookie and Jackson are in...
- Which friends of yours?

02:18.368 --> 02:20.110
You said I could invite friends of mine, did you not?

02:20.192 --> 02:21.938
- I did. 
- Okay, so I did that.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.292
I invited two of my friends, and I put them in room four,

02:24.386 --> 02:27.939
and now room four is taken with my friends as you suggested, okay?

02:29.085 --> 02:31.445
Paw-paw and Chin Chin cannot come to the test run.

02:31.644 --> 02:34.144
- Why not? 
- Because they are dogs, Michel.

02:34.199 --> 02:36.284
They cannot stay home by themselves.

02:36.340 --> 02:38.736
They get lonely and they eat expensive Italian things.

02:38.792 --> 02:42.176
Then get yourself a Chow sitter, because room four is for human beings only.

02:42.238 --> 02:43.959
Terrific, they're on their way up.

02:44.035 --> 02:47.409
Oh, hey, Tom, I'm putting Post-its where we need paint touch-ups.

02:47.482 --> 02:48.069
Got it.

02:48.162 --> 02:51.609
And, you know, we got that test run Saturday. I was really hoping to have some doors by then.

02:51.664 --> 02:54.510
- I told you, the doors are coming. 
- You told me that two weeks ago.

02:54.593 --> 02:56.252
- And I'm sure I meant it. 
- Tom!

02:56.350 --> 02:57.562
I'm calling right now.

02:57.654 --> 03:01.033
I don't understand why you get to bring Rory, and I don't get to bring my Chows.

03:01.192 --> 03:03.030
Because I'm mad with power.

03:03.128 --> 03:06.922
They are cleaner than she is. They are quieter than she is.

03:06.999 --> 03:09.543
Stop comparing your dogs to my kid.

03:09.615 --> 03:12.964
As much as you love Rory, that is how much I love Paw-paw and Chin Chin.

03:13.041 --> 03:15.402
I gave birth to her! I carried her inside me,

03:15.457 --> 03:17.709
and nine months and twenty-six hours later, she came out!

03:17.766 --> 03:21.324
If I could have given birth to them myself, I would have, but I didn't have that choice!

03:21.940 --> 03:23.423
I think that's enough wood there, Kirk.

03:23.686 --> 03:26.476
I put wood in all the guest rooms and the living room,

03:26.528 --> 03:28.533
so all I have to do is store the rest of the cord you bought.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.684
Okay, Michel will take you outside and show you where it goes.

03:30.766 --> 03:33.602
Outside? Do you really want to expose your wood to the elements?

03:33.704 --> 03:36.735
- We'll get a tarp. Michel? 
- Any dogs, Kirk?

03:36.864 --> 03:38.775
Dogs urinate on wood. I hate dogs.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.513
Going with Kirk on his rounds again, Lulu?

03:41.771 --> 03:44.569
I just love it when he looks like the Brawny paper towel guy.

03:44.636 --> 03:45.578
It is a good outfit.

03:45.670 --> 03:48.528
The place looks absolutely wonderful, Lorelai. When does it open?

03:48.604 --> 03:50.864
Two weeks, but we're having a test run on Saturday,

03:50.945 --> 03:53.509
just a bunch of friends who will hopefully still be our friends on Monday.

03:53.622 --> 03:54.983
Sounds wonderful.

03:55.081 --> 03:56.929
- Hey, You and Kirk should come. 
- Really?

03:57.027 --> 03:59.925
Sure. I'll give you Paw-paw and Chin Chin's room. We'd love to have you.

04:00.078 --> 04:01.599
Wow, we would love to come.

04:01.886 --> 04:04.318
And I know Kirk would feel better being able to check up on the wood.

04:04.430 --> 04:06.473
Kirk's lucky to have found you, Lulu.

04:08.245 --> 04:11.311
Oh, pretty garnish! That's some good mincing there.

04:11.388 --> 04:14.987
Just enough walnut. Is that fish done? It should be done. Perfect.

04:15.843 --> 04:17.783
Ooh, man, it smells great in here.

04:17.942 --> 04:20.112
This is the best kitchen staff I've ever had, ever!

04:20.250 --> 04:22.371
I don't know how we got them, but they're amazing!

04:22.689 --> 04:25.822
- I got to show you this mincing. Seriously… 
- No, no, no, no. I believe you.

04:25.965 --> 04:30.149
They seem terrific. But, Sookie, so there are seven workers in here,

04:30.210 --> 04:32.386
- and we're only budgeted for five. 
- I know.

04:32.826 --> 04:33.993
- That's a problem. 
- Yes.

04:34.352 --> 04:38.592
See, I hired seven, figuring that at least two would crap out, and then we'd have five.

04:38.667 --> 04:39.901
- And? 
- And none did.

04:40.016 --> 04:41.370
- So what do we do? 
- I don't know.

04:41.469 --> 04:43.659
Well, maybe the test run will break a couple of them,

04:43.706 --> 04:46.036
but if no one quits, honey, you got to fire two of them.

04:48.248 --> 04:51.703
There are all sorts of chromosomes missing from that man.

04:51.832 --> 04:54.510
- Put Kirk and Lulu in room four. 
- You cut me.

04:54.628 --> 04:58.990
- Okay, so is that it for the rooms? 
- Basically, yes. You and Rory in six, Luke in seven.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.653
- Luke? 
- Yes, Luke

05:00.746 --> 05:04.078
- Oh! So is he coming? Luke's coming? 
- Is he not supposed to?

05:04.192 --> 05:07.608
No, no, of course he was. I mean, he was invited quite a while ago...

05:07.777 --> 05:11.437
before anything happened. I mean, I didn't know he was coming, that's all.

05:11.528 --> 05:14.252
Okay, so good. Luke's in room seven.

05:15.209 --> 05:16.126
Lucky number seven.

05:16.658 --> 05:19.270
Not that it's lucky for Luke, 'cause I don't know what's lucky for Luke, okay?

05:19.930 --> 05:21.322
Look at how he chopped these onions.

05:21.477 --> 05:24.472
I just want to shove a string through them and wear them around my neck!

05:24.641 --> 05:27.774
- That wouldn't be at all eccentric. 
- Oh! Oh, honey, come here.

05:29.828 --> 05:31.322
What is that for?

05:31.482 --> 05:35.029
In all the craziness, I completely forgot that today is your wedding anniversary.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.636
Oh, my god!

06:01.639 --> 06:02.611
- Where'd he go? 
- I don't know.

06:02.701 --> 06:03.757
- What do I do? 
- I don't know!

06:04.009 --> 06:06.967
- Did I lose? 
- Well, you have no head, so probably.

06:07.670 --> 06:10.261
So this is what teenage boys are doing instead of watching television?

06:10.394 --> 06:12.324
- Apparently. 
- Seems like a lateral move.

06:12.702 --> 06:14.229
- Hey, you hungry? 
- I'm starving.

06:14.315 --> 06:18.032
Well, your timing is perfect, 'cause I went to the store yesterday.

06:18.422 --> 06:21.238
Are you kidding me? You just got away from the floorboard life.

06:21.447 --> 06:26.097
Boys will eat everything. I bought vanilla-almond body lotion the other day.

06:26.189 --> 06:28.170
- No. 
- On chips -- mine, by the way.

06:29.143 --> 06:32.272
So, Jess came by to see me.

06:33.378 --> 06:36.138
You've been here 20 minutes, and you drop this now?

06:36.189 --> 06:38.354
He just showed up at my dorm on Saturday night.

06:38.472 --> 06:40.039
- Why? What did he say? 
- Well...

06:40.146 --> 06:40.699
Wait!

06:42.951 --> 06:45.072
- Go. 
- I got home from this awful setup.

06:45.153 --> 06:46.167
The guy your grandmother brought by?

06:46.249 --> 06:47.483
- That's the one. 
- He was that bad?

06:47.580 --> 06:50.351
- James Spader in "Pretty in Pink." 
- You could have just stopped at "James Spader."

06:50.433 --> 06:54.031
Anyway, I left the pub, got back to my dorm, and Jess was there.

06:54.109 --> 06:56.306
- What did he want? 
- He wanted me to come away with him.

06:56.401 --> 06:59.634
- Oh, my God! What did you say? 
- I said -- I don't know.

06:59.717 --> 07:03.943
It was so weird. He was just... Jess.

07:04.076 --> 07:08.321
I mean, he shows up out of no where with this crazy proposal. It was awful.

07:08.409 --> 07:10.005
- It doesn't sound awful. 
- What are you talking about?

07:10.111 --> 07:13.355
- Jess bailed on me twice. 
- I know, but how incredibly romantic

07:13.410 --> 07:16.519
to have this guy show up out of the blue and want to take you away with him.

07:16.575 --> 07:19.652
When I first met Jess, I thought, "What could be better than this?

07:19.729 --> 07:22.566
He's smart, good taste in books and music, so cute."

07:22.648 --> 07:25.935
But Jess is great one minute and then the next...

07:26.067 --> 07:29.191
you know, as far as I know, I could have said yes, packed my bag,

07:29.264 --> 07:31.428
and by the time I got to the car, he would have changed his mind.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.434
- It's part of why he's cute. He's unpredictable. 
- I guess.

07:35.335 --> 07:37.968
You know, when I was with Dean, I always knew

07:38.043 --> 07:40.455
that no matter what happened, he would be there.

07:40.675 --> 07:43.061
- Dean was very dependable. 
- It was more than that.

07:43.188 --> 07:46.681
He's... well, he was so...

07:48.797 --> 07:52.083
I was safe, and he was so nice to me.

07:52.355 --> 07:55.170
- He really loved you. 
- I think I really blew it there, you know?

07:56.163 --> 07:59.185
- I didn't appreciate it. 
- Every girl has to fall for a bad boy.

07:59.251 --> 08:02.308
It's the rule. It's the reason so many accountants eventually get married.

08:06.578 --> 08:12.097
Hey, she's a piratey soul, full of vinegar and glitter,

08:14.176 --> 08:19.773
she is a song of her own, from down the wrong end of the river,

08:22.297 --> 08:27.647
wild like the lily-a-passion, have you ever had the honors

08:29.874 --> 08:33.857
Oh, no, no, no, no, no way

08:38.523 --> 08:40.732
- I can't believe you didn't wake me up. 
- Me and what army?

08:41.394 --> 08:45.069
I only have so much time off. I don't want to waste it all sleeping till noon.

08:45.143 --> 08:47.062
There was no waking you up. You were completely out of it.

08:47.134 --> 08:48.571
We're talking Farrah on "Letterman."

08:49.009 --> 08:50.078
- Hey. 
- What?

08:50.215 --> 08:52.191
Luke is coming over here. I want you to pay very close attention.

08:52.295 --> 08:53.559
- To what? 
- Coffee?

08:53.677 --> 08:56.943
Oh, sure, coffee would be great. Coffee, hon? Yeah, she'll have coffee.

08:57.384 --> 08:58.767
Okay. You want a minute?

08:58.899 --> 09:00.421
- Yes, a minute would be great. 
- Okay.

09:01.571 --> 09:02.447
- Well? 
- What?

09:02.519 --> 09:03.799
- You notice anything? 
- Anything?

09:04.019 --> 09:06.328
- Anything weird, anything different? 
- About Luke?

09:06.642 --> 09:08.489
Of course about Luke. Did you notice anything different?

09:08.566 --> 09:11.156
- Like what? 
- Like a vibe, an attitude.

09:11.213 --> 09:13.353
- Did he look at me differently? 
- Differently than what?

09:13.394 --> 09:15.447
- Differently than he did. 
- Differently than he did when?

09:15.520 --> 09:16.619
- Before. 
- Before what?

09:16.712 --> 09:18.279
Before before. Rory!

09:18.546 --> 09:20.920
How on earth can you be frustrated with me right now?

09:25.502 --> 09:26.956
What's your damage, Heather?

09:29.639 --> 09:31.585
- I think I'm dating Luke. 
- What?

09:31.657 --> 09:34.068
I'm not sure. It's just a possibility. I could be wrong.

09:34.137 --> 09:36.434
But how? When?

09:36.511 --> 09:40.428
I went with him to his sister's wedding, and it was really nice. We had a really good time.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.044
We laughed a lot, and we ate, and then we danced.

09:43.162 --> 09:44.904
- Danced? How? 
- We pop-locked.

09:44.990 --> 09:47.397
Was it a fast dance, slow dance, group dance?

09:47.503 --> 09:49.856
- It was a slow dance. What is "group dance?" 
- The hustle, the hora.

09:49.967 --> 09:53.147
No hustle, no hora. It was a slow dance -- a waltz. Luke can waltz.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.554
- Luke can waltz?! 
- Luke can waltz.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.278
Look how you just said, "Luke can waltz."

09:57.375 --> 09:59.603
What, I'm just saying, I'm surprised that Luke can waltz.

09:59.690 --> 10:02.245
That sounded more like, "I'm surprised I still have my clothes on."

10:02.332 --> 10:03.801
- Oh, stop. 
- What else happened?

10:03.956 --> 10:06.771
Nothing. We spent the evening together. We danced, he walked me home,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.221
then he asked me to a movie. All of these things individually do not add up to dating,

10:10.288 --> 10:13.084
but together, I don't know. And there was this moment,

10:13.217 --> 10:16.231
when he walked me home, where I thought -- I don't know.

10:16.387 --> 10:17.174
Did you say yes?

10:17.887 --> 10:19.073
- When? 
- To the movie.

10:19.172 --> 10:20.077
- Did you say yes? 
- Yes.

10:20.159 --> 10:23.544
- That sounds like dating to me. 
- But maybe he didn't mean it as a date thing.

10:23.616 --> 10:25.060
Maybe he just needed to get out of the house,

10:25.096 --> 10:26.913
and since I'm currently one of the women sitting home,

10:26.965 --> 10:29.673
thinking, "If I could only find a man like Aragorn," he picked me.

10:29.779 --> 10:32.305
- Okay, whoa, this is Luke. 
- I know.

10:32.371 --> 10:36.395
Our Luke -- the town Luke. We see him every day. He's a part of our lives.

10:36.472 --> 10:38.101
- I know. 
- I mean, everyone will know.

10:38.178 --> 10:40.132
They'll know if you're together, they'll know if you're not together.

10:40.276 --> 10:41.972
- I know. 
- You can't just date Luke.

10:42.064 --> 10:44.070
When you're with Luke, you are with Luke.

10:44.156 --> 10:47.307
And if it doesn't work out, it will be really bad for both of us.

10:47.512 --> 10:50.209
I mean, how do you feel about this? Do you want to be dating Luke?

10:50.296 --> 10:52.006
Okay, we're getting ahead of ourselves here.

10:52.072 --> 10:55.744
I don't even know if this is what he's thinking. This could be a totally innocent situation,

10:55.897 --> 10:57.797
and then we've done all this what-iffing for nothing.

10:57.955 --> 11:01.160
Let's just go back in there and see if anything's weird, okay?

11:01.365 --> 11:02.231
- Okay. 
- Okay.

11:06.467 --> 11:07.854
- Is everything okay? 
- Yes.

11:11.899 --> 11:12.788
I'll get the broom.

11:14.089 --> 11:15.232
That was a little weird.

11:35.952 --> 11:38.429
- Two radish roses for a carrot curl? 
- Deal.

11:39.090 --> 11:42.521
- You're trading garnish? 
- Yes, but only 'cause the dinner's gross.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.276
- Very nice. 
- I don't like rabbit.

11:44.394 --> 11:45.818
How convenient. You're not eating rabbit.

11:45.941 --> 11:48.220
- But this is rabbit sauce. 
- It is rabbit sauce.

11:48.363 --> 11:50.975
It is not rabbit sauce. Do not tell her that it's rabbit sauce.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.904
It tastes like rabbit sauce to me.

11:52.996 --> 11:55.910
That just goes to show how much attention you give to meals that are prepared for you.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.454
- If it isn't rabbit, then what is it? 
- It's duck.

11:58.598 --> 12:01.316
- Oh, well, where's that carrot curl? 
- I haven't seen a radish rose.

12:01.455 --> 12:04.384
Never mind. Don't eat it. Sriva, come get the plates. We're done.

12:04.573 --> 12:07.041
- Not everyone is done. 
- Just bring out the dessert, please.

12:07.180 --> 12:11.383
So, Rory, I was thinking maybe we should go away this summer, just you and me.

12:11.547 --> 12:14.726
You should do Europe right at least once in your life, and this seems like the perfect time.

12:15.013 --> 12:18.401
Oh, well, Grandma, I don't really know what I'm doing this summer yet,

12:18.474 --> 12:21.505
- but that sounds really nice. 
- And really out of the blue.

12:21.598 --> 12:23.480
- I agree. 
- Were you going mention this to me?

12:23.572 --> 12:25.812
- I just did. 
- No, before you opened the peanuts.

12:25.969 --> 12:28.228
Plans aren't made, Lorelai. It was just an idea.

12:28.334 --> 12:30.567
If Rory doesn't want to go, then Rory doesn't have to go.

12:30.649 --> 12:32.053
Rory didn't say she didn't want to go.

12:32.175 --> 12:36.583
That's right, Rory's mother was just marveling at the "hey, look over here" approach to the invitation.

12:37.709 --> 12:38.417
You okay, dad?

12:39.010 --> 12:41.882
I'm fine. When is dessert? I have work to do.

12:41.976 --> 12:44.770
It's coming as quickly as the woman can spoon fruit over ice cream.

12:44.872 --> 12:49.383
Well, clearly, she has carpal tunnel or some other modern disease which is slowing her down.

12:49.476 --> 12:52.686
If she's going too slow for you, why don't you just go into the kitchen and give her a hand?

12:53.189 --> 12:55.840
I forgot to mention, we're doing a test run at the inn this weekend.

12:56.045 --> 12:56.582
What?

12:56.741 --> 12:58.825
Yeah, we're inviting all our friends to spend the weekend,

12:58.932 --> 13:01.872
- just to make sure we're ready to open. 
- Well, that sounds sensible.

13:01.969 --> 13:04.974
Hey, you know what would be great? If the two of you came.

13:05.138 --> 13:06.356
- What? 
- For the weekend.

13:06.541 --> 13:07.621
- Oh. 
- Well...

13:07.718 --> 13:11.632
I mean, I've been working toward this goal for, my God, what is it, Rory, now, twenty years?

13:11.706 --> 13:13.930
- Twenty years. 
- Twenty years, wow.

13:13.970 --> 13:17.293
So basically, this is the biggest thing that's ever happened to me in my life,

13:17.390 --> 13:20.877
except for Rory being born, and I'm sure my parents wouldn't want to miss it.

13:21.240 --> 13:24.707
I mean, unless there's some specific reason why you guys can't come,

13:24.860 --> 13:30.227
both of you together. No? Okay, good, so you'll be there.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.019
Fantastic. Isn't that great, Rory?

13:32.121 --> 13:35.991
Grandma and Grandpa are coming to the test run together.

13:36.719 --> 13:37.272
Lorelai...

13:37.466 --> 13:40.322
Dad, seriously, you have no idea how much this means to me.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.409
We wouldn't miss it for the world.

13:49.299 --> 13:51.470
So, inviting them to stay in the inn is going to do what?

13:51.545 --> 13:54.255
I'm not inviting them to stay in the inn. I'm inviting them to stay in the bungalow

13:54.321 --> 13:56.549
- 150 feet away from the inn. 
- Diabolical.

13:56.619 --> 13:59.227
I'm going to lock those two in a room, and they are either coming out reconciled

13:59.292 --> 14:01.551
or in a body bag. Believe you me, I'm fine either way.

14:01.653 --> 14:03.403
Well, look who died and made you Hayley Mills.

14:05.662 --> 14:07.255
- Hey Kirk, just sit... 
- We need to talk.

14:07.786 --> 14:09.323
Where are you going? Hey!

14:12.754 --> 14:13.926
Get out of my apartment.

14:14.597 --> 14:17.377
This place is small. I always pictured you in a bigger place.

14:17.479 --> 14:19.599
Do me a favor and don't picture me in any place, okay, Kirk?

14:19.690 --> 14:21.893
You have nice windows, though. I don't have windows.

14:22.175 --> 14:24.457
My room at my mom's house used to be a bomb shelter.

14:24.551 --> 14:27.811
- It's very cold but great for racquetball. 
- Kirk, what do you want?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.486
I need to talk to you.

14:29.993 --> 14:32.548
- You're the only one I can confide in. 
- Oh, goody.

14:33.510 --> 14:36.843
Lorelai invited Lulu and me to the test run of the inn.

14:37.637 --> 14:40.458
Lulu is very excited about the invitation.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.924
It's all she talks about -- a romantic weekend at the inn with me.

14:45.518 --> 14:49.849
Anyhow, I'm a little concerned about this invitation, because...

14:50.656 --> 14:54.788
- Lulu and I have never spent the night together. 
- Oh well, this is not a comfortable area for me.

14:54.881 --> 14:58.599
- I mean, we've had sex -- lots and lots of sex. 
- And this is even more uncomfortable.

14:58.660 --> 15:01.957
- We just haven't actually spent the night together.
- Why not?

15:02.101 --> 15:03.406
I have night terrors.

15:04.441 --> 15:07.349
- Night terrors? 
- Basically, I freak out at beddy-bye.

15:07.436 --> 15:10.036
About an hour after I fall asleep, I wake up in panic.

15:10.461 --> 15:14.106
Everything around me seems threatening, scary, out to get me.

15:14.542 --> 15:17.225
Two nights ago, I was suddenly gripped with the overwhelming feeling

15:17.307 --> 15:19.119
- that there was an assassin in my house. 
- Jeez.

15:19.212 --> 15:21.203
I had to get out of the room before he got me,

15:21.300 --> 15:24.905
so I jumped out of bed and locked my pillow in the bathroom.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.467
- Why? 
- Because it was a bomb.

15:26.594 --> 15:28.755
- Of course. 
- After neutralizing my pillow,

15:28.857 --> 15:31.506
I ran up the stairs, climbed out the bathroom window,

15:31.643 --> 15:34.325
scaled the trellis up the side of the house, and hid on the roof…

15:34.754 --> 15:36.881
- Completely naked. 
- Aw, jeez!

15:36.999 --> 15:39.974
The worst part of night terrors is it always ends up with me

15:40.065 --> 15:43.992
on top of the roof completely naked or running down the street completely naked

15:44.115 --> 15:46.634
or swimming in the community-center pool completely naked.

15:46.850 --> 15:48.488
That was the time I thought I was on fire.

15:48.627 --> 15:49.583
Kirk, that's terrible.

15:49.748 --> 15:54.002
Well, I'm used to it now, so it's kind of second nature to me, but Lulu...

15:54.115 --> 15:56.419
- Right, Lulu. 
- How is she going to take it?

15:56.557 --> 16:01.345
I mean, I could scare her or ninja-kick her and lock her up with a pillow.

16:01.708 --> 16:03.442
I think I love her, Luke,

16:03.669 --> 16:05.661
and I haven't even told her that I love her.

16:05.921 --> 16:10.038
I spelled it out in chocolate-covered Oreos once, but she was really hungry,

16:10.073 --> 16:11.866
and I'm not sure if she read it first.

16:12.045 --> 16:15.731
I can't assault her before I tell her I love her.

16:15.824 --> 16:17.048
What do you want me to do about it?

16:17.129 --> 16:21.629
I called the Dragonfly and had them put me and Lulu in the room right next to yours.

16:22.081 --> 16:25.920
That way, if you hear anything -- screaming or Russian --

16:26.084 --> 16:28.466
you can come in and pull me off of Lulu.

16:28.567 --> 16:31.410
Unless, when you come in, it looks like you shouldn't pull me off of Lulu.

16:31.497 --> 16:33.283
- Kirk. 
- You can use your judgment on that one.

16:33.371 --> 16:35.505
- Kirk, I don't know about this. 
- Please!

16:35.689 --> 16:38.941
This weekend means so much to her. I can't tell her we're not going.

16:39.448 --> 16:41.408
Fine.

16:42.187 --> 16:43.892
Thank you, Luke, thank you.

16:44.675 --> 16:47.731
- Remember, anything weird, just jump on in. 
- I got it, Kirk.

16:47.794 --> 16:50.333
Just don't touch my bottom, or I'll think you have a machete.

16:51.403 --> 16:54.890
If you want this to happen, do not use the word "bottom" with me again, Kirk.

16:55.141 --> 16:56.298
Right. See you later.

16:57.045 --> 16:58.311
- Hey, Luke? 
- What, Kirk?

16:58.944 --> 17:00.112
What kind of clothes are you bringing?

17:02.949 --> 17:05.098
My kitchen staff's great -- all seven of them!

17:05.186 --> 17:06.047
Hang in there, Sookie.

17:06.175 --> 17:08.509
If only one would suck, maybe it would rub off on the rest.

17:08.718 --> 17:11.213
Plenty of sucking potential still out there, have some faith.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.741
Tom, where are my doors? They were supposed to be here by now.

17:13.981 --> 17:16.603
Yeah, I know. They took a wrong turn and headed to Woodbridge.

17:17.064 --> 17:19.210
- What? 
- Relax, I'm trying to track them down.

17:19.837 --> 17:22.599
Tom, guests are showing up here any second.

17:22.686 --> 17:25.410
They have no doors. People will have to get very friendly very quickly.

17:25.733 --> 17:27.843
I got the guy on the phone. I'll get right back to you.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.461
Tom? Tom?

17:30.541 --> 17:32.333
Hey, I've changed my mind. I want to be a ballerina.

17:32.456 --> 17:34.878
- Good timing. 
- Okay. So, we don't have doors,

17:35.006 --> 17:38.282
and every single person I hired is fantastic. We're doomed.

17:38.578 --> 17:41.727
The guests are arriving. I repeat, the guests are arriving.

17:41.959 --> 17:44.672
No, Michel, we still don't have doors. Is there anything you can do to stall them?

17:44.836 --> 17:46.371
No. I'm bringing them up now.

17:46.771 --> 17:49.254
Boy, if he was on my kitchen staff, we'd be home free by now.

17:49.378 --> 17:51.267
- I got 'em. 
- Doors? You got the doors?

17:51.482 --> 17:54.078
They're on their way up. My guys will be standing by to get them on.

17:54.230 --> 17:55.735
Tom, I'm loving you like a two dollar whore.

17:55.977 --> 17:58.312
- Terrific. I'll tell the wife. 
- Okay.

17:58.390 --> 18:00.948
Everybody, the doors are on the way, guests are coming.

18:01.328 --> 18:03.523
Everybody outside to greet them. It's showtime. Let's go!

18:04.025 --> 18:06.478
Okay, everyone, remember, these people are not our friends.

18:06.570 --> 18:09.930
They are customers. Just relax, don't rush, and don't kill anybody.

18:10.216 --> 18:10.912
Here they come!

18:27.967 --> 18:30.461
Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Dragonfly Inn.

18:30.696 --> 18:34.244
- Oh, will you look at this place! 
- It's a paradise.

18:34.377 --> 18:38.156
Oh, Lorelai, the babies that are going to be conceived on this property!

18:38.283 --> 18:41.100
Oh, are those horses! Babette, look at the horses.

18:41.197 --> 18:44.484
That's Cletus and Desdemona, and if anyone would like to go for a ride,

18:44.566 --> 18:45.842
Michel can set it up for you.

18:46.017 --> 18:48.570
The ride up here was very dusty, Lorelai.

18:48.657 --> 18:52.043
You should warn people not to wear their white pants upon arrival.

18:52.114 --> 18:55.191
- I will do that, Taylor. 
- So, do I bring my own bags in or…?

18:55.258 --> 18:57.951
No, you don't. Eric, Jeremy, Sam, these bags, please.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.394
The blue one has breakables.

19:00.828 --> 19:04.515
Okay, they're unloading them in the back. I already sent Dean in to start putting them up.

19:04.627 --> 19:06.174
- Great. Thank you, Tom. 
- I'll be right back.

19:06.277 --> 19:07.142
Make sure the keys are ready.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.356
Well, hey there, you two! Good to see you!

19:10.470 --> 19:13.746
I am so excited to be here. Thank you so much for the invitation.

19:13.833 --> 19:16.454
- You're welcome. Have a good time. 
- Oh, horses.

19:16.940 --> 19:18.989
- Is Luke here yet? 
- No, he's not, Kirk.

19:19.071 --> 19:21.323
But he's coming, right? He'll be here before I go to sleep?

19:21.584 --> 19:23.863
- I have no idea, Kirk. Why? 
- It's a guy thing.

19:38.034 --> 19:39.746
I have to get this upstairs.

19:40.616 --> 19:41.977
- Can't we talk? 
- What about?

19:42.710 --> 19:44.707
- He didn't stay. 
- Yeah. I don't care.

19:44.907 --> 19:47.722
I told him to go. He went. He's gone.

19:47.784 --> 19:49.857
- Well, great. 
- Why are you so mad?

19:49.950 --> 19:54.349
- I'm not mad. I'm working. 
- I left you three messages. You didn't answer any of them.

19:54.466 --> 19:57.685
You blew me off at Luke's today. You won't look me in the eye.

19:59.479 --> 20:00.650
I have to go.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.572
- I told him to leave. 
- You told me to leave, also.

20:04.665 --> 20:07.665
- I told you to leave so I could tell him to leave. 
- That makes sense.

20:07.736 --> 20:12.856
It does make sense, Dean. I didn't ask him to come. I did ask you to come, remember?

20:12.954 --> 20:16.596
- I know. I just...
- What -- why are you so mad?

20:16.855 --> 20:19.851
 I thought you were back with him or something.

20:19.994 --> 20:22.728
- No, I'm not back with him. 
- I thought you were.

20:22.856 --> 20:23.731
Well, I'm not.

20:24.300 --> 20:28.739
But even if I was back with him, why would it bother you so much?

20:29.452 --> 20:30.219
I don't like him.

20:34.060 --> 20:36.343
And I don't want you with him.

20:38.001 --> 20:38.626
Right.

20:41.529 --> 20:43.877
Because he doesn't treat me right, right?

20:45.077 --> 20:46.413
Right.

20:47.590 --> 20:52.333
And you wouldn't want me to be with someone who doesn't treat me right, because…

20:53.434 --> 20:54.504
you're my friend, right?

20:56.849 --> 20:57.423
Right...

20:59.736 --> 21:00.663
I'm your friend.

21:03.751 --> 21:06.680
Dean! How we doing with those doors?

21:07.125 --> 21:08.420
We're doing fine, Tom.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.880
There you go, Freddy, you're in room nine. Just follow your door.

21:25.879 --> 21:29.151
Oh, honey, this place is spectacular.

21:29.254 --> 21:32.679
Thanks, Patty. You're in room one. I hope you like it.

21:32.808 --> 21:34.805
Oh, I just know everything's going to be perfect.

21:34.892 --> 21:37.404
There is nothing that you could do that I wouldn't love.

21:37.450 --> 21:39.976
No, that is not the point here. This is a test run.

21:40.088 --> 21:42.965
We need to work out all the kinks this weekend so they don't happen again,

21:43.077 --> 21:45.519
so we're depending on your feedback, and especially your criticism.

21:45.627 --> 21:48.726
- All right, I promise to be a pain. 
- I appreciate that.

21:48.885 --> 21:50.788
Just follow your door to your room.

21:52.923 --> 21:54.132
After you, sweetheart.

21:54.853 --> 21:58.453
Well, you can count on me for my feedback, Lorelai. I promise you that.

21:58.540 --> 22:00.794
In fact, I've already got fourteen complaints written down.

22:00.963 --> 22:05.381
Most of them are small infractions, but it's the little things -- the details --

22:05.468 --> 22:08.233
that distinguish the Barbra Streisands from the Roslyn Kinds.

22:08.356 --> 22:09.312
Absolutely, Taylor.

22:09.436 --> 22:11.814
I even took it upon myself to bring my own comment cards

22:11.911 --> 22:13.957
just in case you didn't think to supply them.

22:14.080 --> 22:17.448
Well, we did supply comment cards, but I'm sure yours are even better.

22:17.587 --> 22:20.295
That was a very polite response. I'm writing that down.

22:20.940 --> 22:24.002
Excuse me, I need some stuff taken out of my room.

22:24.095 --> 22:26.496
- What stuff? 
- The lamp, the bronze bookends,

22:26.613 --> 22:30.238
the books, the shoehorns, the sewing kit. Are the paintings bolted to the walls?

22:30.692 --> 22:34.233
Well, bring some pliers in case simple yanking doesn't do it.

22:34.370 --> 22:36.655
I am not yanking the pictures off the wall.

22:37.611 --> 22:39.768
Well, apparently, you've never been in love.

22:40.761 --> 22:43.014
There you go, room eight. Just follow your door.

22:44.724 --> 22:47.390
Hey, you know, this door thing is actually pretty fun.

22:47.611 --> 22:51.394
Michel said to fill in for him. Kirk has him taking the light bulbs out of all the sconces.

22:51.533 --> 22:57.370
Oh, Mom, Dad! Look, Rory, there are your grandparents and everything they own.

22:57.503 --> 23:00.734
You didn't tell us what attire was required, so I had to pack everything.

23:00.888 --> 23:02.878
Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa. We're so glad you could come.

23:02.997 --> 23:07.113
We're delighted to be here. May we have our key? I'm tired from the drive.

23:07.241 --> 23:09.560
- It takes twenty minutes to get here. 
- It felt longer.

23:09.720 --> 23:13.517
- Which way do we go, upstairs? 
- No, mom, you and dad aren't upstairs.

23:13.648 --> 23:15.372
You're in our nicest room.

23:15.890 --> 23:20.025
Guys, will you take my parents to room twelve? The boys will take you there.

23:20.195 --> 23:22.483
- Where are they going? 
- Just follow them, Mom.

23:22.883 --> 23:26.794
- They're heading outside. 
- Yes. Your room has its own entrance for privacy.

23:26.968 --> 23:29.330
- Oh. Well, fine. We'll see you later, Rory. 
- Bye.

23:30.809 --> 23:34.592
- You are the bad seed. 
- "I have the prettiest mother. Everybody thinks so."

23:41.536 --> 23:45.222
- Hey, hi. You came. 
- Sure. I RSVP'd.

23:45.324 --> 23:47.699
Here, these are for you -- a little congratulations.

23:47.827 --> 23:50.834
Oh, my God, they're beautiful. Thank you. I was...

23:53.296 --> 23:59.301
Well, okay, so, we should get you all checked in. And that's... over there.

23:59.750 --> 24:02.932
- You okay? 
- Oh, God, yeah. Me? I'm totally fine.

24:03.241 --> 24:04.791
- Lorelai! 
- Oh, God.

24:05.979 --> 24:11.294
I'm fine. No problem. That was your door, so you could just follow that on up…

24:11.354 --> 24:14.345
- and we'll see you at dinner. Rory? 
- Are you sure you're okay?

24:14.432 --> 24:17.600
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine It's like the third time I did that today. It's a bit.

24:18.061 --> 24:21.732
We're going to be the comedy inn. We finally found our theme.

24:21.871 --> 24:24.078
So, you got your key, and... bye.

24:27.954 --> 24:29.751
I've locked you in before, and I will do it again.

24:39.648 --> 24:41.783
- Hey, how it going? 
- It's going very well.

24:41.927 --> 24:43.073
Very, very well.

24:43.871 --> 24:47.574
- Oh, Jackson, I love the shirt. 
- Isn't it great? It's an anniversary gift from Sookie.

24:47.759 --> 24:49.443
- Sweet, huh? 
- These two kids.

24:49.536 --> 24:52.961
I got to tell you, I was completely surprised. I figured, with the test run and everything,

24:53.124 --> 24:56.054
- she'd be way too busy to remember. 
- What are you talking about,

24:56.094 --> 24:59.432
- Sookie could never forget her mushroom man. 
- I'd love her to forget that nickname though.

24:59.468 --> 25:01.496
- The food's great, mom. 
- Yes, it is great.

25:01.547 --> 25:03.620
Although I admit, I know the chef, so I'm a little biased.

25:03.656 --> 25:05.597
You're a little biased. I'm sleeping with her.

25:05.674 --> 25:09.258
- You also grew the vegetables. 
- Oh, I did. I can't be trusted at all.

25:09.517 --> 25:13.241
Wow Tom, I have never seen you in a suit before!

25:13.333 --> 25:15.956
Really? 'Cause I'm more a suit guy than anything else.

25:17.608 --> 25:19.477
- I'm going to make the rounds. 
- We'll be here.

25:21.003 --> 25:24.693
- Hi, how is everything this evening? 
- Oh, my god, these robes!

25:24.812 --> 25:27.265
What are they made of? 'Cause I am never getting dressed again.

25:27.729 --> 25:30.034
- How are you doing? 
- I'm just staring at my plate.

25:30.092 --> 25:34.662
He's shy. My bathrobe slipped earlier, and his poor little heart couldn't take it.

25:34.756 --> 25:37.659
- He's been staring at his salad ever since. 
- I like salad.

25:37.884 --> 25:41.469
- Patty, you wanna try my fish? 
- Fish has too much mercury.

25:41.600 --> 25:44.167
- For this fish, you'll eat the mercury. 
- Oh yeah?

25:44.810 --> 25:48.575
- Okay, well, you two go easy on him, now. 
- We'll try.

25:49.041 --> 25:51.013
- Oh! I'm sorry, Derek. 
- You okay?

25:51.396 --> 25:52.879
There's a debate going on about that.

25:56.040 --> 25:58.021
- We're all set up. 
- Stop whispering in my ear, Kirk.

25:58.107 --> 25:59.691
- I'm just saying… 
- You're still doing it, Kirk.

26:00.509 --> 26:03.852
- Can I get you anything, Mr. Doose? 
- Another pen would be nice.

26:04.124 --> 26:06.331
- Do you have enough paper? 
- Just the pen will be fine.

26:06.418 --> 26:07.376
Coming right up.

26:09.853 --> 26:12.449
- Hey, Taylor, how is he? 
- Who?

26:12.855 --> 26:14.062
The kid, Derek.

26:15.220 --> 26:17.008
Is he rude, slow, stupid?

26:17.697 --> 26:20.115
No, actually, he's been an excellent waiter all evening.

26:20.943 --> 26:21.726
Crap.

26:24.655 --> 26:27.609
Hey, I have no need of salad in my life ever, but this is amazing.

26:28.209 --> 26:29.955
He's great. They're all great.

26:30.381 --> 26:34.676
What happened to the disenfranchised youth of America? Where did all these worker bees come from?

26:34.757 --> 26:37.266
Cheer up, Sookie, the food's going over like gangbusters.

26:38.122 --> 26:42.165
I went to check on the backup generators. Everything is fine.

26:42.253 --> 26:45.930
- And the dinner's going great. 
- Everyone's settled, the doors are up.

26:46.181 --> 26:48.401
- Everyone seems happy. 
- They do, don't they?

26:51.321 --> 26:52.304
This is gonna work.

26:57.357 --> 26:59.692
- What are you doing here? 
- The place looks great.

26:59.785 --> 27:00.951
Thank you. What are you doing here?

27:01.480 --> 27:03.675
- We need to talk. 
- Not now we don't.

27:03.778 --> 27:06.877
- I stayed away, I gave you space. 
- You gave me space? We broke up.

27:06.977 --> 27:09.610
I didn't look at it that way. I looked at it as a cooling-off period.

27:09.697 --> 27:11.939
How very revisionist of you. Jason, I'm working.

27:12.042 --> 27:12.749
- Ten minutes. 
- No!

27:12.897 --> 27:14.377
Lorelai, we were doing great.

27:14.519 --> 27:18.529
Until you decided to sue my father, yeah, we rocked. Thank you. Goodbye.

27:18.647 --> 27:19.420
I am not leaving.

27:19.644 --> 27:22.087
Jason, please, I have an inn full of people here.

27:22.661 --> 27:25.748
- Okay, one room, please. 
- What?

27:25.825 --> 27:27.003
I would like a room. How much is a room?

27:27.146 --> 27:28.604
No, no. Jason, you can't stay here.

27:28.773 --> 27:32.097
Every room is taken. Please go. I will call you on Monday.

27:32.179 --> 27:35.175
I can't wait until Monday. It gives you too much time to talk yourself out of trying again.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.923
First I would have to talk myself into trying again, so let's make it Tuesday.

27:38.015 --> 27:39.753
- I'll wait till you're done. 
- I'm not going to be done for two days.

27:39.838 --> 27:42.218
- I'll wait till you take a break. 
- I will not have a break for two days.

27:42.321 --> 27:46.255
This is a terrible job. I would like a word with your boss. Who is above you?

27:46.346 --> 27:47.964
Jason, I can't do this.

27:48.419 --> 27:52.112
Lorelai, I've been sitting in my apartment for two weeks staring at a dead plant

27:52.183 --> 27:55.383
that you gave me. Now I know we can work this out. I am not leaving until we do.

27:56.064 --> 27:56.857
Oh, boy.

27:57.072 --> 28:00.114
Just go about your business, and when you're ready to talk, I will be here.

28:03.247 --> 28:05.399
Oh, look, "Above Connecticut." I've been looking for that.

28:12.398 --> 28:14.731
- Hey, Kirk, I'm getting tired. 
- You are?

28:14.952 --> 28:18.444
- Would you mind if we went to bed? 
- No, that's fine. You're tired.

28:18.842 --> 28:21.141
So, then... Let's go upstairs and go to bed!

28:21.654 --> 28:24.893
- Okay. Good night, everyone. 
- I'm right behind you.

28:28.310 --> 28:30.845
I think Kirk wants you to go upstairs and make love to him.

28:30.982 --> 28:31.817
Will you just roll?

28:34.321 --> 28:37.659
- Hey, how's it going here? 
- She's letting me win. It's very annoying.

28:38.192 --> 28:39.175
How's it going with you?

28:39.287 --> 28:43.485
Well, we locked the kitchen crew in with Michel for twenty minutes, and it backfired a little.

28:43.594 --> 28:46.052
Six of them quit, and we have to start hiring again tomorrow.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.954
When you're done, would you run home and grab some CDs?

28:49.006 --> 28:52.185
I totally forgot to have them in case one of the guests wants to play something in their room.

28:52.256 --> 28:56.111
Sure, no problem. Hey, you do notice that Jason's sitting in the other room, right?

28:56.158 --> 28:57.540
- Yeah, I'm handling it 
- Okay.

29:03.941 --> 29:05.420
- Here. 
- What's this?

29:05.907 --> 29:08.073
You've been sitting there all night. You must be hungry. Eat something.

29:09.086 --> 29:09.721
Thanks.

29:10.611 --> 29:12.476
- Here, sit and have dinner with me. 
- Oh, Jason.

29:12.578 --> 29:14.984
- I'll feed you. It'll be adorable. 
- How much longer are you going to stay?

29:15.051 --> 29:18.067
Just long enough to fix everything that went wrong between us.

29:18.231 --> 29:20.304
Luckily, I'm currently unemployed. I have plenty of time.

29:20.360 --> 29:23.387
- You're very stubborn. 
- I just refuse to lose the things that are important to me.

29:24.946 --> 29:28.086
Full house! Oh, my God, I'm kicking your ass!

29:28.256 --> 29:31.204
- Hey, Babette, who's that? 
- Who's what?

29:32.536 --> 29:36.694
Oh, that's Jason Stiles. He was Lorelai's boyfriend for the last six months.

29:36.954 --> 29:37.999
- Oh, yeah? 
- Yeah.

29:38.556 --> 29:42.106
Not exactly who I pictured her with, but he does have a very nice car.

29:42.223 --> 29:45.208
Anyhow, they were hiding their relationship from her parents,

29:45.402 --> 29:47.579
'cause Jason was her father's business partner.

29:47.676 --> 29:51.590
Well, of course, the parents found out about it, and all hell broke loose.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.987
- Jason wound up suing Lorelai's father. 
- They still together?

29:55.126 --> 29:58.792
I don't know. I thought they broke up, but he's here, so maybe.

29:58.920 --> 30:02.171
I could ask Patty for you if you want. Sometimes she gets the news first,

30:02.248 --> 30:04.746
'cause her phone line picks up other people's conversations --

30:05.013 --> 30:09.468
something about proximity to the power lines. I'll tell ya, location, location, location.

30:09.882 --> 30:12.283
- I have to get back to work. 
- Go, work. I'm fine. I'm comfortable.

30:12.370 --> 30:15.872
I have food, Sookie brought me wine, and I've moved on to "Gnomes of the West."

30:16.649 --> 30:18.104
I'll have someone bring you out some dessert.

30:21.908 --> 30:24.899
- Lorelai Gilmore, why would you do that?! 
- Do what?

30:24.991 --> 30:27.505
You stuck your father and me out in that Godforsaken cabin!

30:27.597 --> 30:28.651
It's the honeymoon suite.

30:28.759 --> 30:32.487
One room, no access to the main building, pitch-black at night.

30:32.554 --> 30:34.458
- It's romantic. 
- No television, no radio.

30:34.605 --> 30:36.987
Actually there is a television. It's in the cabinet behind...

30:37.059 --> 30:39.096
- And then the room service. 
- Roast beef and champagne.

30:39.179 --> 30:42.246
The one chance to get out of there, away from each other, and you yank it away!

30:42.420 --> 30:45.328
Why would you want to get away from each other, Mom? Are you and Dad fighting?

30:45.405 --> 30:48.589
Stop it! You know! You know your father and I are separated,

30:48.712 --> 30:52.643
and you brought us out here and stuck us in the woods to stare at each other for 48 hours!

30:52.742 --> 30:55.593
What was I supposed to do? You weren't saying anything, Dad wasn't saying anything.

30:55.901 --> 30:57.978
Of all the cruel, insensitive...

30:58.066 --> 30:59.806
How was I supposed to know I was supposed to know?

30:59.893 --> 31:01.854
- You did know! 
- But you didn't want me to know.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.581
- Of course I didn't want you to know. 
- Exactly.

31:03.715 --> 31:04.507
Exactly what?

31:04.610 --> 31:06.919
You didn't want me to know, so I didn't know, and now you're mad I didn't know?

31:07.002 --> 31:08.010
Because you did know!

31:08.169 --> 31:10.555
But I wasn't supposed to know, so I acted like I didn't know!

31:10.637 --> 31:14.834
And then you forced your father and me to come here tonight under pretense of family obligation.

31:14.931 --> 31:16.523
Well, hello, that's the Gilmore way.

31:16.591 --> 31:19.970
I won't stay out in that cabin one more second. I demand a room in here.

31:20.027 --> 31:22.110
We don't have any rooms in here, Mom. They're all taken.

31:22.156 --> 31:24.691
- Then bump someone. 
- Can't you and Dad just talk about it?

31:24.737 --> 31:27.030
No, you stop it right now! This is none of your business.

31:27.082 --> 31:31.132
- What happened? Was it Floyd's lawsuit? 
- Lorelai, just give me a room.

31:31.173 --> 31:34.214
- I don't have a room, Mom. 
- You don't have a room for your mother?

31:34.250 --> 31:36.226
I have a room for my mother. It's the room my mother's in.

31:36.257 --> 31:37.910
That's not a room. That's a practical joke.

31:37.987 --> 31:41.934
No, it was a chance for you and Dad to do something special.

31:42.012 --> 31:45.283
Fine. If you won't find me another room, then I'll just sit in there until tomorrow.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.231
- Jason. 
- Emily.

31:49.805 --> 31:52.451
- Do you have a room? 
- No, Mom, he doesn't.

31:52.533 --> 31:55.687
He just showed up here, because, apparently, it's Blake Edwards night at the dragonfly.

31:56.815 --> 31:57.315
Emily.

31:58.662 --> 32:00.045
- Jason? 
- Richard.

32:00.346 --> 32:01.155
He has a room.

32:01.821 --> 32:03.557
- Are you trying to kill us? 
- Oh, my god.

32:04.145 --> 32:05.932
I packed our things. I think it's time to go.

32:06.900 --> 32:09.577
- I hope you've had your fun. 
- Oh, yeah, it's been a blast.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.018
Can I get their room?

32:23.800 --> 32:26.903
- How'd you know I was here? 
- Your mom said she sent you on an errand.

32:27.026 --> 32:28.655
Ah, you went right to the source.

32:30.716 --> 32:31.983
- Can I...
- Sure.

32:32.203 --> 32:32.926
Thanks.

32:35.352 --> 32:37.431
I'm just trying to find some CDs for the Dragonfly.

32:38.358 --> 32:40.605
I hear Taylor's a big hip-hop fan.

32:40.728 --> 32:42.378
Oh, he hops with the hippest of them.

32:45.702 --> 32:47.435
Your room looks the same.

32:48.141 --> 32:52.561
Yeah, I tried that whole French revival thing, but it didn't really work for me.

32:54.456 --> 33:00.292
So... is it weird being back at home after being away for a while?

33:01.013 --> 33:02.473
No, it feels completely normal.

33:04.818 --> 33:05.606
So...

33:08.315 --> 33:08.986
Today...

33:10.252 --> 33:11.951
Yes, today.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.285
An interesting day.

33:15.330 --> 33:17.450
I'd authorize a case study if I could.

33:18.606 --> 33:21.508
You know, I could be wrong, but somehow I had a feeling

33:21.576 --> 33:23.967
that maybe if Tom hadn't have come in when he did...

33:24.059 --> 33:24.929
- Dean? 
- Yeah?

33:25.831 --> 33:27.884
- Lindsay. 
- It's not working with Lindsay.

33:29.405 --> 33:32.681
- I can't make it work. I've tried. 
- Are you sure?

33:32.760 --> 33:36.234
Because I've heard that the first two years of marriage are the hardest.

33:36.311 --> 33:37.126
We're not happy.

33:38.380 --> 33:41.114
She's not happy, and I can't make her happy.

33:41.468 --> 33:42.457
I can't imagine that.

33:42.558 --> 33:47.519
It was a mistake, and I know that now. From the very beginning, it wasn't...

33:47.627 --> 33:49.106
- Wasn't what? 
- It wasn't...

33:52.210 --> 33:53.039
Maybe you could...

33:54.646 --> 33:58.184
- go see a counselor or go away together. 
- No, it's just...

34:00.280 --> 34:05.424
It's over. We both feel it. I know we both feel it.

34:05.511 --> 34:08.701
- You and Lindsay? 
- Yeah, me and Lindsay.

34:08.878 --> 34:11.784
- You both feel it's over? 
- I tried. We tried.

34:12.768 --> 34:15.985
Well, if it's over, I'm sorry.

34:16.464 --> 34:17.027
You are?

34:17.917 --> 34:19.157
I'm sorry you're not happy.

34:19.848 --> 34:26.243
I'll be happy again. Things happen for a reason, right?

34:26.694 --> 34:27.364
Right.

34:30.605 --> 34:34.706
I can't believe this is... that we're...

34:35.100 --> 34:35.929
I can…

35:01.945 --> 35:03.696
- Hey. How you doing? 
- Good.

35:04.116 --> 35:06.115
- Good. Luke Danes. 
- Jason Stiles.

35:06.913 --> 35:08.887
So, I see you had the pot roast.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.104
- Good, huh? 
- Yeah, very good.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.907
All the food was great tonight.

35:14.341 --> 35:18.011
So, Jason Stiles, Jason Stiles.

35:18.094 --> 35:20.296
- I'll tell ya, that name is familiar. 
- I'm a friend of Lorelai's.

35:20.510 --> 35:22.676
- Yeah, me too. I own the diner in town. 
- Yeah, she's mentioned you.

35:22.783 --> 35:24.657
Has she? Well, it's nice to be mentioned.

35:26.587 --> 35:30.756
- So... you know Lorelai from where? 
- Actually, we're dating.

35:32.194 --> 35:33.607
- You're dating? 
- Going on six months.

35:33.694 --> 35:34.682
- You're dating now? 
- Yeah.

35:35.225 --> 35:37.785
Oh sorry, my mistake. I thought you two had...

35:38.128 --> 35:40.990
Well, we hit a rough patch, but we're working through it.

35:41.072 --> 35:41.815
Well, good for you.

35:41.989 --> 35:44.590
When it's right, it's right, and Lorelai and I are right.

35:44.718 --> 35:47.206
- That's great. I'm very happy for you. 
- Thanks.

35:47.739 --> 35:50.438
- Hey, you have any idea where the men's room is? 
- It's back through the dining room.

35:50.532 --> 35:52.496
- Thanks, it was nice meeting you. 
- Sure, you too.

36:03.805 --> 36:07.665
- Hey. The last one up? 
- No, not the last one.

36:08.711 --> 36:11.142
You okay? I heard Babette was kicking your butt at Yahtzee.

36:11.269 --> 36:13.933
- Actually, I'm feeling pretty stupid right now. 
- Why?

36:14.066 --> 36:15.474
I'm not a mysterious man, am I?

36:15.633 --> 36:17.070
Well, the wardrobe's a bit of a head scratcher.

36:17.159 --> 36:19.370
I think I've been very, very clear with my intentions...

36:19.487 --> 36:21.725
You know, the wedding, the movie invite, the flowers.

36:23.410 --> 36:25.683
- Luke...
- You knew what I was doing!

36:25.775 --> 36:28.802
- Well, no, not officially. 
- Not officially? Oh, come on.

36:28.884 --> 36:30.819
I mean, I didn't have a ref present, but other than that.

36:30.890 --> 36:33.471
- Well, you didn't say anything official. 
- What was I supposed to say?

36:33.553 --> 36:36.426
I did things. I let my actions speak. That's what you're supposed to do.

36:36.533 --> 36:39.871
Your supposed to let your actions speak. That's the romantic way to do this, damn it.

36:39.958 --> 36:42.805
- Okay, you're right. I'm sorry. 
- And you went along with all of it.

36:43.387 --> 36:45.949
So naturally, I assumed we were on the same page,

36:46.061 --> 36:48.749
and then your boyfriend shows up here at the inn that I invested in.

36:48.923 --> 36:51.114
Whoa, what boyfriend? Are you talking about Jason?

36:51.208 --> 36:54.488
- No, Tom. Yes, Jason. 
- You guys were talking? What did he say?

36:54.570 --> 36:59.245
He said you were together. I mean, I was sitting there listening to this guy spout on and on

36:59.312 --> 37:02.932
about how it's right, you're right, he's right. The whole time, I'm thinking,

37:02.999 --> 37:05.323
"What the hell have I been doing all this for? She's taken."

37:06.896 --> 37:09.716
I'm not taken! We broke up!

37:09.843 --> 37:12.245
- Well, he doesn't know that! 
- Well, just calm down!

37:12.342 --> 37:16.491
I don't want to calm down! I did everything right! I did exactly what the book said!

37:16.858 --> 37:18.651
- The book?! 
- I thought we were on track,

37:18.769 --> 37:21.171
and now you're standing there looking at me like I'm crazy.

37:21.257 --> 37:22.799
I'm not looking at you like you're crazy!

37:22.885 --> 37:26.228
You know the last time I bought flowers for someone? Never! That's when!

37:26.295 --> 37:28.819
- Very easy stat to remember! 
- I loved the flowers!

37:28.906 --> 37:31.364
And then when I walked you home after the wedding, there was a moment.

37:31.435 --> 37:33.342
- I thought there was a moment. 
- There was!

37:35.297 --> 37:36.674
There was a moment.

37:40.212 --> 37:41.005
What are you doing?

37:41.328 --> 37:42.607
Will you just stand still?

37:54.046 --> 37:54.747
What are you doing?

37:55.915 --> 37:57.036
Will you just stand still?

38:17.645 --> 38:19.518
I'll be right back. I'll explain later.

38:22.421 --> 38:23.087
Rory!

38:24.531 --> 38:26.809
Oh, my God. You're missing everything.

38:27.361 --> 38:31.822
Grab those CDs and head back to the inn before you miss the cross-dressing midgets.

38:31.928 --> 38:36.291
That's where the night is headed. Oh! Things are happening -- big things, wow things.

38:36.639 --> 38:40.710
I have so much to tell you. Let me just open with this little tidbit --

38:41.207 --> 38:44.540
Kirk running naked through the square.

38:45.149 --> 38:47.525
Of course, with all my careful planning and preparation,

38:47.677 --> 38:52.388
I forgot to bring Band-aids and a camera. I have got to learn that, always, without fail,

38:52.665 --> 38:53.884
Kirk equals camera.

38:54.703 --> 38:55.685
Hey, what's going on?

38:56.571 --> 38:57.878
Dean came over to borrow something.

39:02.861 --> 39:04.601
- Thanks. 
- You're welcome.

39:06.756 --> 39:09.279
So... I should go.

39:11.486 --> 39:12.305
Bye, Lorelai.

39:13.407 --> 39:14.195
Bye, Dean.

39:18.409 --> 39:21.046
So, I'm almost done getting the CDs together.

39:21.302 --> 39:23.646
I picked a wide selection so we'd have choices,

39:23.723 --> 39:27.876
and then I picked a bunch that probably only you will like, but it's good to have options.

39:33.620 --> 39:35.141
So, what did he borrow?

39:37.102 --> 39:39.294
I'm sorry I didn't talk to you about it first.

39:39.539 --> 39:45.576
I know I promised I would, but I swear, I didn't know that this was going to happen.

39:45.883 --> 39:49.543
I mean, I didn't know he was going to show up tonight, and it just happened.

39:49.959 --> 39:53.178
It's awful for you to find out like this, I know, but everything's okay.

39:53.322 --> 39:55.836
I'm okay, and we were, you know, safe.

39:55.944 --> 39:58.770
So all those Trojan man jokes all these years really apparently stuck.

39:59.553 --> 40:02.201
And I'm lucky, too, because Dean, he's...

40:03.388 --> 40:08.790
Well, aren't you glad that it happened with someone who's good and really loves me?

40:10.300 --> 40:13.357
- But he's married. 
- You don't understand the situation.

40:13.521 --> 40:15.281
- Is he still married? 
- Yes, but...

40:15.386 --> 40:17.039
Then I understand the situation.

40:17.238 --> 40:19.368
It's not working out between them. They're not happy.

40:19.496 --> 40:20.392
Oh, Rory.

40:21.447 --> 40:24.073
He tried the best he could, but it didn't work. It's over.

40:25.185 --> 40:26.162
- He told you that? 
- Yes.

40:26.513 --> 40:28.823
- He told you he's leaving her? 
- Well...

40:29.025 --> 40:33.628
He told you he's moving out, they're getting divorced, he's got a lawyer,

40:33.724 --> 40:36.224
they've divided up the monster-truck season tickets?

40:36.321 --> 40:40.237
- We didn't get around to discussing everything. 
- You didn't get around to discussing everything?

40:40.319 --> 40:41.507
It was a crazy night.

40:41.615 --> 40:45.987
You, of all people -- the girl who thinks everything through, the list maker --

40:46.110 --> 40:50.134
you didn't bother to discuss those things before jumping into bed with a married guy?

40:50.231 --> 40:53.231
He's not a married guy. He's Dean -- my Dean.

40:53.340 --> 40:56.248
He's not your Dean. He's Lindsay's Dean. You're the other woman.

40:56.335 --> 40:57.748
I told you, it's over.

40:57.917 --> 41:00.882
It's not over until he's out of the house with the ring off.

41:01.055 --> 41:02.299
He took the ring off.

41:03.129 --> 41:06.995
- Oh, my God, I don't believe this. 
- He's in love with me, not Lindsay.

41:07.087 --> 41:09.262
- Does Lindsay know that? 
- She's not good for him, okay?

41:09.437 --> 41:12.857
She lets him quit school and work himself to death and...

41:13.001 --> 41:17.854
No, Rory, you can't be one of those girls who blames the wife for forcing the husband to cheat.

41:17.962 --> 41:20.292
- He wasn't cheating. 
- He was cheating, Rory.

41:20.511 --> 41:23.015
He was cheating, and you were cheating with him.

41:23.240 --> 41:27.957
- There's no other way to spin that, kid. 
- I'm not spinning it, and I'm not a kid. I'm 19.

41:28.132 --> 41:32.466
This is your first time. It's just not the way your first time was supposed to be.

41:32.569 --> 41:34.423
Oh, and how was my first time supposed to be?

41:34.520 --> 41:37.106
Well, first of all, it was supposed to be in a retirement home.

41:37.182 --> 41:39.794
And secondly, ideally, it was supposed to be with someone single.

41:39.891 --> 41:42.671
My first time was with someone sweet and kind who loves me.

41:42.754 --> 41:45.001
I didn't raise you to be like this.

41:45.089 --> 41:48.319
I didn't raise you to be the kind of girl who sleeps with someone else's husband.

41:48.421 --> 41:51.273
- You slept with dad when he was with Sherry. 
- He wasn't married to Sherry.

41:51.364 --> 41:53.428
He was engaged, and she was pregnant.

41:53.525 --> 41:56.397
So, this is all my fault? I set one crappy example for you,

41:56.470 --> 41:58.814
and you have no choice but to follow in my footsteps?

41:59.091 --> 42:01.892
Rory, what are you going to do now? Huh? Is there a plan?

42:02.066 --> 42:03.704
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

42:03.981 --> 42:07.386
- I just want what's best for you, that's all! 
- I don't want to talk about it!

42:07.490 --> 42:10.299
I just don't want you to get hurt, Rory. What if he doesn't leave her?

42:10.422 --> 42:12.265
Now you're all emotionally involved.

42:12.341 --> 42:14.319
You're just mad because I didn't come running to you to discuss

42:14.390 --> 42:17.031
whether or not I was ready for this step. I decided it on my own.

42:17.180 --> 42:18.650
Well, obviously, you weren't ready for this step.

42:18.737 --> 42:22.060
The very fact that you chose another girl's guy to sleep with proves that!

42:22.162 --> 42:24.400
- He was my boyfriend first! 
- But you dumped him!

42:24.498 --> 42:27.083
- You rejected him! You picked someone else! 
- Stop it!

42:27.206 --> 42:29.424
- Rory! 
- I hate you for ruining this for me!
