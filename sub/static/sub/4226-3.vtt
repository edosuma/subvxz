Falling Skies...

00:03.111 --> 00:05.407
I was in school
when the ships came.

00:06.721 --> 00:08.274
All electronics stop working.

00:08.299 --> 00:11.521
They killed grown-ups,
and they catch kids.

00:12.845 --> 00:13.657
Get off.

00:13.682 --> 00:16.820
We cannot fight these things
unless we know how.

00:18.054 --> 00:19.158
Ben.

00:19.183 --> 00:20.774
He's alive.
We got to go get him.

00:20.799 --> 00:22.093
They die, just like us.

00:22.702 --> 00:24.333
Just got to get close.

00:25.655 --> 00:28.173
I thought you were all
just a bunch of strangers

00:28.198 --> 00:29.701
thrown together by fate.

00:31.305 --> 00:33.081
Ships are gonna target
the flares.

00:34.415 --> 00:36.119
Well, I guess you got me
after all.

00:36.144 --> 00:37.649
I said you could go look
for your son.

00:37.674 --> 00:39.038
Do you have any idea
where he is?

00:39.063 --> 00:41.622
Margaret -- she saw some
harnessed kids out by a hospital.

00:41.647 --> 00:42.547
What if it's a trap?

00:42.560 --> 00:44.859
Go to the van. Don't wait for us.
You go, and you go fast.

01:20.226 --> 01:21.559
Ben's on the roof.

01:21.594 --> 01:24.228
Looks like they're
scavenging scrap metal.

01:24.262 --> 01:26.297
That's <i>exactly</i>
what they're doing.

01:30.335 --> 01:32.736
They flew here in spaceships
and turned kids into slaves

01:32.770 --> 01:36.005
just to collect old toasters
and copper wire?

01:36.039 --> 01:38.139
Well, there must
be <i>some</i> reason for it.

01:38.174 --> 01:40.608
You think they know
what's happening to them?

01:40.642 --> 01:41.642
I hope not.

01:41.676 --> 01:43.043
How many kids
are you trying to grab?

01:43.077 --> 01:44.311
As many as we can.

01:47.216 --> 01:51.253
Okay, let's see
what we're up against.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.657
Okay, we got two Mechs

01:54.691 --> 01:56.392
patrolling in front
of the building.

01:56.426 --> 01:58.293
And there's that one
behind the back.

01:58.328 --> 01:59.729
Skitter
by the collection bin.

01:59.763 --> 02:01.597
And another one
inside the building.

02:01.631 --> 02:03.933
Six of us, five of them.

02:03.968 --> 02:05.635
I like those odds.

02:06.970 --> 02:08.237
All right,
we do this now --

02:08.270 --> 02:11.673
tired as we are,
low on ammo, low on supplies --

02:11.707 --> 02:13.741
I mean, losing Click was enough,
wasn't it?

02:13.775 --> 02:16.110
That's my son over there.
I know.

02:16.144 --> 02:19.112
But we may only get one shot
at this. Okay, Tom?

02:19.146 --> 02:21.447
They're gonna be here tomorrow
and the day after that.

02:21.482 --> 02:23.215
Okay. How about we do this?

02:33.026 --> 02:35.060
Dad, come on.
We'll be back.

02:35.095 --> 02:37.797
We'll get him, Dad.

03:04.522 --> 03:07.024
Welcome home.

03:07.058 --> 03:08.625
Love what you've done
with the place.

03:08.660 --> 03:09.694
Did you find Ben?

03:09.728 --> 03:11.595
Ben and about a dozen others,
yeah.

03:11.630 --> 03:13.697
Is he all right?

03:13.732 --> 03:14.799
He's alive.

03:14.833 --> 03:16.734
Look, there's some
really good news.

03:16.769 --> 03:18.303
What's that?

03:18.337 --> 03:21.773
Excuse me. Um, did you,
uh, see my daughter?

03:21.808 --> 03:23.142
No.

03:23.176 --> 03:25.210
No, no, I'm sorry. We didn't
really get that close.

03:25.245 --> 03:27.413
Our son -- he's been missing
since the second week.

03:27.448 --> 03:28.748
Maybe you saw him.
No, I'm sorry.

03:28.782 --> 03:30.350
Please. No, I --
Okay, everybody, just --

03:30.384 --> 03:32.652
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Break it up. Give them some space.

03:32.687 --> 03:33.887
We've got the right
to ask!

03:33.921 --> 03:35.255
Hey, no one's saying
you don't.

03:35.289 --> 03:37.791
But we <i>all</i> have missing kids,
including Tom here.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.226
And you.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.561
That's right --
my boy, Rick.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.531
Okay, look, everybody, I know
what you're going through.

03:43.565 --> 03:45.166
We all just want
to get our kids back.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.403
And I promise that we're
gonna do everything possible

03:48.437 --> 03:50.305
to make sure that
that happens.

03:50.339 --> 03:52.240
Wait, look. There's a --

03:52.275 --> 03:53.742
there's a school-announcement
board here.

03:53.776 --> 03:54.809
Why don't you guys
take your pictures

03:54.844 --> 03:56.211
and post your missing kids
up here?

03:56.245 --> 03:58.246
Yeah. Great idea.
Yeah, and write their name,

03:58.281 --> 03:59.714
hair color,
weight, height...

03:59.749 --> 04:01.183
Last time
that you saw them.

04:01.217 --> 04:02.984
Yeah, anything that
you guys can think of

04:03.019 --> 04:04.519
that'll help us
identify them.

04:04.553 --> 04:06.654
I promise that all the squads
will check this board

04:06.689 --> 04:09.157
before each
and every mission.

04:09.191 --> 04:10.591
Okay?

04:12.694 --> 04:14.962
Thank you --
both of you.

04:14.996 --> 04:16.529
Porter's here.

04:16.564 --> 04:18.298
He's not due back
for another couple weeks.

04:18.332 --> 04:20.567
You know that good news?
He brought it.

04:20.601 --> 04:23.336
He's delivering a briefing
in the command post.

04:31.780 --> 04:35.015
Take a seat.

04:41.289 --> 04:44.125
The picture in this war
is changing.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.727
One of the runners
that we sent west

04:46.761 --> 04:49.830
ran into a contingent
of resistance fighters

04:49.864 --> 04:51.432
just outside of Chicago.

04:53.034 --> 04:55.669
But they've made contact

04:55.703 --> 05:00.073
with other groups in Texas,
Oklahoma, even California.

05:00.107 --> 05:02.275
What that means is...

05:02.310 --> 05:05.311
We're not in this alone anymore,
people.

05:05.345 --> 05:07.947
That's the good news.

05:09.016 --> 05:10.349
The bad news...

05:10.384 --> 05:13.486
Is that alien structures
like the one that's over Boston

05:13.520 --> 05:16.623
are going up over every city
that we know about.

05:16.657 --> 05:18.358
Anybody figured out
what they're for?

05:18.392 --> 05:19.592
No, Weaver.

05:19.627 --> 05:21.862
So as of now...

05:21.896 --> 05:23.330
we're in a full-court press

05:23.364 --> 05:26.166
to gather intelligence
on the enemy.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.868
I want to know about his plans.

05:27.903 --> 05:29.604
I want to know
about his tactics.

05:29.638 --> 05:31.640
I want to know about his weapons
and his technology --

05:31.674 --> 05:32.741
everything.

05:32.775 --> 05:36.412
Now that you people have
a secure operating base,

05:36.446 --> 05:39.916
I want you to start collecting
war material.

05:39.950 --> 05:41.117
That means motorcycles.

05:41.152 --> 05:43.687
That means weapons,
explosives, camo gear --

05:43.721 --> 05:46.323
anything and everything

05:46.357 --> 05:48.992
that could be used
to support a growing insurgency.

05:49.026 --> 05:52.029
Weaver, put 'em to work.

05:52.063 --> 05:53.964
All right,
start breaking your units down

05:53.998 --> 05:58.036
into search-and-requisition
teams of four to six fighters.

05:58.070 --> 06:00.171
I'll give you your assignments
tomorrow.

06:00.205 --> 06:02.006
Dismissed.

06:04.209 --> 06:06.745
Hey, Tom.

06:09.316 --> 06:11.917
Got a report that you spotted
a bunch of harnessed kids.

06:11.951 --> 06:14.620
Yeah, we were tracking
my son Ben. We found him.

06:14.654 --> 06:17.590
At night, they've got them
in a hospital off Route 9,

06:17.624 --> 06:19.892
and by day, the Skitters
have them salvaging scrap metal.

06:19.926 --> 06:21.794
Yeah, we've gotten reports
like that before.

06:21.828 --> 06:23.929
They seem to use them
as some sort of slave labor.

06:23.963 --> 06:24.997
Yeah.

06:25.031 --> 06:26.832
Look, Tom, our science team

06:26.867 --> 06:28.868
is struggling
with this harness thing.

06:28.902 --> 06:31.037
They were able
to get it off of three kids,

06:31.071 --> 06:33.940
but they died
a couple hours later.

06:35.676 --> 06:37.010
I'm sorry to hear that.

06:37.045 --> 06:39.112
Yeah, well...

06:39.147 --> 06:41.815
The chief surgeon thinks he's
got an answer to the problem.

06:41.849 --> 06:45.386
But in order to test the theory,
he needs a kid.

06:49.124 --> 06:50.458
Ben?

06:50.492 --> 06:52.460
Look, Tom...

06:52.494 --> 06:54.829
I'll understand
if you want to say no.

06:54.864 --> 06:58.067
But this is probably
the best --

06:58.101 --> 06:59.735
hell, it may be
the <i>only</i> chance

06:59.770 --> 07:01.737
Ben and any of the other kids
have got.

07:01.772 --> 07:03.940
Yeah.

07:03.974 --> 07:06.476
Yeah. Um...

07:08.379 --> 07:10.714
I can't go back
and just rescue one kid,

07:10.748 --> 07:11.915
even if it's my own son.

07:11.950 --> 07:13.216
We need to rescue them all.

07:13.251 --> 07:15.151
We will, in time.
The time is now.

07:15.186 --> 07:17.254
If it were up to me,
you wouldn't be going at all.

07:17.288 --> 07:18.955
Our priority has to be
winning this war.

07:18.990 --> 07:21.558
There are hundreds of people
out there with missing kids.

07:21.592 --> 07:24.060
We rescue those kids, as many as
we can, we keep their hope alive.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.429
We give up on those kids, those
people are gonna give up hope, too.

07:26.463 --> 07:30.366
We save a few dozen kids
and lose the war,

07:30.400 --> 07:33.235
they're no better off
than they were in the harness.

07:33.270 --> 07:35.504
Well, they'd die free.

07:38.874 --> 07:40.675
I think we're wasting time
and resources,

07:40.709 --> 07:42.476
but it's not my call.

07:42.510 --> 07:44.811
That's right. It's mine.

07:47.515 --> 07:48.915
Just Ben this time.

07:48.950 --> 07:50.450
That's it.

07:50.485 --> 07:52.152
Right.

07:57.725 --> 07:58.858
You okay?

08:00.861 --> 08:04.431
Did you know I was due to retire
when all this happened?

08:04.466 --> 08:08.769
Nothing to look forward to
but golf and travel and...

08:08.804 --> 08:11.205
A stack of spy novels
on my nightstand.

08:14.677 --> 08:16.144
Listen, Tom...

08:16.178 --> 08:19.214
You go out there
and get Ben.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.683
But, damn it, be careful.

08:55.518 --> 08:56.651
Hey, buddy.

08:56.686 --> 08:59.288
Hey.

08:59.322 --> 09:01.657
I'm back.

09:01.691 --> 09:03.092
Did you bring Ben?

09:04.261 --> 09:07.597
No, not this time,
but we found him, and he's safe.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.698
We're gonna go back for him.

09:13.002 --> 09:15.169
What's the matter?

09:17.139 --> 09:18.940
Come on. I can take it.

09:20.475 --> 09:22.108
At school today,

09:22.143 --> 09:25.879
some kid said that when you take
those things off their backs,

09:25.913 --> 09:28.549
the kids die.

09:31.252 --> 09:32.485
Yeah.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.621
Well...

09:34.655 --> 09:36.390
That was before.

09:37.325 --> 09:38.459
Before?

09:38.493 --> 09:40.661
Before a really smart doctor
figured out

09:40.695 --> 09:42.629
how to take them off safely.

09:42.664 --> 09:43.764
What doctor?

09:43.798 --> 09:46.567
He came here today
with Colonel Porter.

09:46.601 --> 09:48.936
He's gonna teach Anne
how to do it, too.

09:48.970 --> 09:51.738
So Ben's gonna be okay?

10:04.618 --> 10:05.918
Hey.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.020
Hungry?

10:07.054 --> 10:09.489
You bet I am.

10:09.523 --> 10:10.757
Here you go.

10:10.791 --> 10:12.559
Everybody's got
a right to eat.

10:12.593 --> 10:13.694
Thank you.

10:20.202 --> 10:21.169
You got a problem?

10:21.203 --> 10:22.704
What is this --
Skitter a la king?

10:22.738 --> 10:24.005
Chicken and rice.

10:24.039 --> 10:25.106
Are you sure?

10:25.140 --> 10:26.741
Look, if it's not up
to your usual high standards,

10:26.775 --> 10:28.242
you'll have to make
allowances.

10:28.276 --> 10:29.810
We all take turns
in the kitchen.

10:29.844 --> 10:32.646
Let me guess --
it was your turn.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.715
First of all, the chicken
shouldn't bleed like this.

10:35.749 --> 10:37.424
It's way undercooked. That,
and you got enough salt in

10:37.449 --> 10:38.649
here to give my kid a stroke.

10:38.752 --> 10:40.419
And what is that?
What is that -- paprika?

10:40.453 --> 10:42.621
Paprika?
Nobody puts paprika on chicken.

10:42.655 --> 10:44.690
What are you -- Hungarian?

10:44.724 --> 10:46.992
You do realize
you're a prisoner, right?

10:48.294 --> 10:50.896
Before you grill it, fry it,
put it on a barbecue,

10:50.931 --> 10:53.165
you poach
the chicken first,

10:53.200 --> 10:54.300
preferably
in some chicken stock

10:54.334 --> 10:55.735
with a little bit
of herbs and spices.

10:55.769 --> 10:58.270
That way, it absorbs <i>all</i>
the herbs and <i>all</i> the spices.

10:58.305 --> 11:00.172
And then you can drop it
onto a barbecue,

11:00.207 --> 11:01.808
you can grill it,
put it into a frying pan,

11:01.842 --> 11:04.677
and all that moisture and all that
flavor's already cooked into it.

11:04.712 --> 11:06.879
What are you -- a cook?

11:07.681 --> 11:10.148
Certified culinary arts.

11:10.182 --> 11:13.084
And it's "chef,"
not "cook."

11:15.687 --> 11:17.688
How was the food?

11:18.990 --> 11:20.557
When I could stomach

11:20.592 --> 11:23.660
eating with a bunch
of degenerate psychos...

11:23.694 --> 11:25.261
The food wasn't bad.

11:25.296 --> 11:26.663
And who prepared it?

11:27.698 --> 11:29.132
Pope.

11:29.167 --> 11:31.735
He said he trained
in prison.

11:31.770 --> 11:33.804
I say we just put him
to the test.

11:33.839 --> 11:36.174
We already have people
who can cook.

11:36.208 --> 11:38.443
Yeah, they can cook...

11:38.478 --> 11:39.945
Oatmeal.

11:39.979 --> 11:43.649
He'll be under guard
at all times.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.654
You three can go.

11:48.688 --> 11:50.022
Send him in!

11:50.056 --> 11:52.191
Yes, sir!

12:02.002 --> 12:03.903
So, you want to cook?

12:03.937 --> 12:06.539
Oh, I'd love to...

12:06.573 --> 12:09.609
If you had anything
to cook <i>with.</i>

12:09.643 --> 12:13.647
He showed me what you got,
and what you've got...

12:13.681 --> 12:17.084
Are 50 cans of lima beans...

12:17.119 --> 12:20.054
32 cans of tuna fish,
some chicken...

12:20.089 --> 12:21.422
And rice.

12:22.892 --> 12:25.059
"Rots" and "rots" of rice.

12:27.697 --> 12:29.797
Don't you people know
how to scrounge?

12:29.832 --> 12:32.533
You were here for weeks before
we came along. What did you eat?

12:32.567 --> 12:35.802
We hunted.
There wasn't about a dozen of you.

12:35.837 --> 12:37.471
Okay?
We've got 300!

12:37.505 --> 12:39.573
Maybe you can't
hack it, Pope!

12:39.607 --> 12:41.608
Hey...

12:41.643 --> 12:45.212
I cooked Thanksgiving dinner
for three entire cell blocks.

12:45.246 --> 12:47.247
That's 170 inmates.

12:47.281 --> 12:51.585
If they didn't like my food,
I'd lose body parts.

12:51.619 --> 12:53.387
Here's the deal, Pope --

12:53.421 --> 12:57.124
the facilities are substandard,
the provisions are meager,

12:57.158 --> 12:59.460
and until Scott rigs the burners
for propane,

12:59.494 --> 13:01.462
you're gonna be cooking
on camp stoves.

13:01.496 --> 13:03.197
Now, if you're not up to it,
you just say the word,

13:03.232 --> 13:04.699
and we'll put you
back in lockup.

13:08.237 --> 13:10.239
I'll do it.

13:10.273 --> 13:11.540
But for the love of God,

13:11.574 --> 13:15.344
could somebody please
find me some olive oil?

13:17.515 --> 13:19.149
Hey.

13:19.183 --> 13:20.718
How'd it go?

13:20.752 --> 13:22.219
Um, that good news
that you mentioned,

13:22.254 --> 13:23.454
it was about
the harnesses.

13:23.488 --> 13:24.455
That's right.

13:24.489 --> 13:26.390
Have you talked
to Porter's guy yet?

13:26.424 --> 13:27.824
Briefly.

13:27.859 --> 13:30.360
And what do you think?

13:30.395 --> 13:33.164
Oh, the procedure is simple,
to the point of elegance.

13:33.198 --> 13:34.965
What about the guy?

13:34.999 --> 13:36.633
It's just
my first impression,

13:36.668 --> 13:39.470
but he's very smart,
very capable,

13:39.504 --> 13:42.239
and very sure
he's the best man for the job.

13:43.140 --> 13:45.375
I suppose
he's good-looking, too?

13:45.409 --> 13:48.645
I don't know. Lourdes, did you
think he was good-looking?

13:49.480 --> 13:51.314
Uh, yeah, for an older man.

13:51.348 --> 13:52.615
Older?

13:52.649 --> 13:54.917
He must be, like, 40.

13:54.951 --> 13:56.618
Ohh! Ouch.

13:56.653 --> 13:57.886
Oh, no,
I didn't mean that --

13:57.921 --> 13:59.688
Oh, no,
that's quite all right.

13:59.722 --> 14:01.790
I think I kind of walked into that one.

14:01.824 --> 14:05.059
So
Who is this medical genius?

14:05.094 --> 14:08.263
Harris.
Dr. Michael Harris.

14:09.665 --> 14:11.098
Do you know him?

14:11.133 --> 14:13.234
Tom?

14:14.236 --> 14:15.769
Tom!

14:15.804 --> 14:17.271
Michael.

14:17.305 --> 14:19.006
You're alive?

14:19.041 --> 14:20.842
Yeah, so are you.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.322
Rebecca and I foraged

14:30.323 --> 14:33.559
for a couple of hours,
-- and...

14:33.593 --> 14:34.827
it looked like rain,

14:34.861 --> 14:37.095
so...we both figured

14:37.130 --> 14:39.164
it'd be more efficient
to split up.

14:39.199 --> 14:42.435
And -- and there hadn't been
an a-attack for a while.

14:42.469 --> 14:44.169
Yeah, I remember.

14:44.204 --> 14:47.006
We weren't apart
five minutes --

14:47.040 --> 14:49.041
these airships started
pounding the area,

14:49.075 --> 14:51.477
and I-I-I-I tried
to get to her, Tom.

14:51.511 --> 14:54.680
I really did,
and, uh, I --

14:54.714 --> 14:56.181
and I got this.

14:58.318 --> 15:00.485
And, uh...

15:01.721 --> 15:04.623
And then the second wave of
the attack started, and, uh...

15:07.060 --> 15:11.664
...I hid
in a collapsed house.

15:11.698 --> 15:12.832
I passed out.

15:12.866 --> 15:15.968
And a group of fighters
found me the next day,

15:16.003 --> 15:20.106
and I became the medical officer
for the resistance.

15:21.341 --> 15:25.578
I can't tell you how sorry I am
about your wife, Tom.

15:32.853 --> 15:34.854
Thanks for telling me.
Sure.

15:37.558 --> 15:39.125
Where are your boys?

15:40.561 --> 15:42.462
Hal and Matt are with me.
Ah.

15:42.496 --> 15:43.896
Ben's a prisoner.

15:43.931 --> 15:47.066
Is he harnessed?
Mm-hmm.

15:48.335 --> 15:50.469
- Is he nearby?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:50.504 --> 15:53.039
We were gonna try
to go get him tonight.

15:53.074 --> 15:55.275
You know...

15:55.310 --> 15:58.379
when we found Rebecca...

15:59.314 --> 16:01.082
...we went
to go look for you.

16:02.184 --> 16:05.220
But there were Skitter patrols
everywhere, and...

16:05.254 --> 16:06.822
You don't owe me
an apology.

16:06.856 --> 16:08.523
This is war, right?

16:08.557 --> 16:10.124
Yeah.

16:10.159 --> 16:12.060
Bring Ben to me.

16:13.595 --> 16:14.729
I couldn't save Rebecca,

16:14.763 --> 16:17.331
but maybe I can give you back
your boy.

16:39.054 --> 16:41.290
Okay, let's go.

17:05.181 --> 17:07.215
They didn't see
the explosives in the car.

17:07.250 --> 17:08.483
That's good.

17:34.579 --> 17:36.613
What's going on?

17:36.647 --> 17:39.149
The first crew's here.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.751
Ben with them?

17:41.785 --> 17:43.353
I don't see him.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.894
There's another crew coming.

17:56.167 --> 17:58.334
I think I see him.

18:00.604 --> 18:02.405
No, it's not him.

18:02.439 --> 18:04.007
It's Rick.

18:04.041 --> 18:04.974
What?

18:05.009 --> 18:07.143
It's my boy.
Where?

18:07.177 --> 18:08.378
Right by the building.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.614
Ricky!
No! No! No! Cover me.

18:11.649 --> 18:13.149
No! No! No!

18:13.184 --> 18:15.385
Ricky!

18:16.787 --> 18:19.923
Ricky. Rick. Rick.

18:19.958 --> 18:22.593
It's dad. Dad.

18:22.627 --> 18:23.894
Come on.

18:38.476 --> 18:39.576
They must have Ben.

18:39.611 --> 18:41.078
Let's go.

18:49.388 --> 18:51.656
There's the truck!

18:51.690 --> 18:52.891
I'm going after Ben.

19:36.155 --> 19:38.790
Where's Hal? Karen?

19:38.824 --> 19:41.594
We couldn't get them.

19:41.628 --> 19:43.663
We were running
for the truck.

19:43.697 --> 19:46.266
Got hit by debris
from the explosion.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.467
Tom, we got you this far.

19:47.501 --> 19:48.769
Where's Hal and Karen?!

19:48.803 --> 19:51.939
There was a Mech on our tail.
Couldn't wait.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.841
How far to the school?

19:53.875 --> 19:55.643
A quarter-mile,
maybe less.

19:55.677 --> 19:57.144
You two go on.

19:57.179 --> 19:59.046
What about you?
I'm going after them.

19:59.081 --> 20:00.915
At least come with us for
weapons and reinforcements.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.351
No.
There's no time.

20:04.653 --> 20:06.921
What were you thinking,
Mike?

20:06.956 --> 20:09.491
I'm so sorry, Tom.

20:09.525 --> 20:12.560
He's the only family
I got left.

20:13.496 --> 20:15.062
Where are the rest
of the weapons?

20:15.097 --> 20:16.931
I had to leave them
in the truck.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.234
Just got this.

20:20.303 --> 20:23.638
Let me have that rope, too,
and your flashlight.

20:27.910 --> 20:30.312
Be careful.

20:48.865 --> 20:50.366
Who's there?

20:56.039 --> 20:57.339
Aah!

21:59.504 --> 22:02.273
It's only natural
that you want to do that.

22:02.307 --> 22:04.375
Captain Weaver?
Colonel Porter?

22:04.410 --> 22:05.777
What is it, Anthony?

22:05.811 --> 22:07.779
Dai and Mike are back
with one of the harnessed kids.

22:07.814 --> 22:09.081
Yeah -- Ben, Tom's son.

22:09.115 --> 22:11.650
No, sir. Mike's.
They're in the clinic.

22:11.685 --> 22:13.819
Guys, it's Tom -- he's back!

22:13.854 --> 22:15.954
What is this?
You -- you go ahead.

22:15.989 --> 22:18.623
I'll see what this is.

22:43.048 --> 22:45.417
Tom!

22:46.519 --> 22:48.287
Captain Weaver.

22:48.321 --> 22:51.524
I've brought you
a prisoner of war.

22:55.563 --> 22:58.164
You beat this thing
yourself?

22:58.198 --> 23:00.499
Yes, sir.

23:00.534 --> 23:02.467
How?

23:03.836 --> 23:05.804
You just got to
get close enough.

23:07.974 --> 23:10.008
Can I trade this in
for an automatic?

23:10.042 --> 23:12.910
Where you think
you're going?

23:12.945 --> 23:16.647
I still have two sons
and a scout out there.

23:19.085 --> 23:20.585
Sentry, give me your weapon.

23:20.620 --> 23:23.923
I'll give you
two fighters.

23:23.957 --> 23:26.192
No. Thanks.
It's safer if I do this alone.

23:39.875 --> 23:41.942
Hey, buddy.

23:42.977 --> 23:45.212
How much did you hear?

23:45.246 --> 23:47.680
Everything.

23:47.715 --> 23:50.484
Go get him.

24:28.391 --> 24:29.859
Ben.

24:32.964 --> 24:34.097
Ben!

25:29.987 --> 25:31.920
No!!

25:31.955 --> 25:34.290
No!!

25:38.179 --> 25:41.382
The father says the patient
has cystic fibrosis.

25:41.417 --> 25:44.552
Really?
I didn't hear anything.

25:45.553 --> 25:49.323
Well, he's on
supplemental oxygen, so...

25:49.358 --> 25:53.495
As long as his airways are
clear, shouldn't be a problem.

25:54.998 --> 25:57.333
Boy, I'll tell you --

25:57.367 --> 26:00.436
if we'd have had access to...

26:00.470 --> 26:02.338
Modern hospitals and labs,

26:02.372 --> 26:06.442
we could have this all figured
out in a matter of hours.

26:06.477 --> 26:10.746
As it was,
it's just educated guesses...

26:10.781 --> 26:13.483
and trial and error.

26:15.219 --> 26:16.586
What can I do to help?

26:16.620 --> 26:19.455
Uh, you can stay
out of my way.

26:19.490 --> 26:20.957
Here you go.

26:20.991 --> 26:24.227
All right, get ready
to lift the harness, please.

26:25.596 --> 26:26.830
The whole idea behind this

26:26.864 --> 26:30.568
is to expose as much needle
as possible.

26:30.602 --> 26:32.270
Pulling those out
kills them.

26:32.304 --> 26:36.775
Yeah, well, that's why we've
been cutting them instead.

26:36.809 --> 26:38.443
Learned that the hard way.

26:38.477 --> 26:40.811
So did a lot of people.

26:40.845 --> 26:43.814
Wouldn't you
rather be outside?

26:47.451 --> 26:49.485
I like to expose...

26:49.519 --> 26:51.820
...at least
an inch of needle.

26:51.855 --> 26:53.722
Start the drip, please.

26:53.756 --> 26:56.024
How far?
All the way.

27:08.439 --> 27:11.041
Lift up the harness,
please.

27:16.715 --> 27:18.683
Okay.

27:22.821 --> 27:25.222
You know,
the first few times

27:25.256 --> 27:27.857
we cut the needles...

27:27.892 --> 27:29.659
We lost the patients.

27:29.694 --> 27:30.894
Why?

27:32.329 --> 27:35.464
Look at his eyes.

27:39.102 --> 27:41.237
Pinpoints.

27:41.271 --> 27:43.372
He's drugged?
Yeah.

27:43.407 --> 27:46.610
My theory
is that the harness...

27:46.644 --> 27:48.612
synthesizes an opiate.

27:48.646 --> 27:51.482
Didn't show up
in the autopsy.

27:51.517 --> 27:54.719
It's like nothing
we've ever seen before.

27:54.754 --> 27:57.088
But I realized...

27:57.123 --> 27:58.924
If you cut the needles,
you cut off the drug,

27:58.958 --> 28:00.525
the kid goes into shock --

28:00.559 --> 28:03.729
end of story.

28:03.763 --> 28:05.597
Oh.

28:05.631 --> 28:08.800
The -- the morphine drip
is a bridge.

28:08.834 --> 28:10.368
That's right.

28:10.402 --> 28:12.703
That's the idea, anyway.

28:12.737 --> 28:18.107
And all opiates basically
affect the same brain receptors.

28:20.778 --> 28:23.848
So then I thought,
pump the kid full of morphine...

28:25.550 --> 28:27.584
...before we cut off
the harness.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.922
Then, once he's stable,

28:31.957 --> 28:33.792
you walk back the dosage,

28:33.826 --> 28:38.563
bring him in
for a soft landing.

28:40.166 --> 28:43.035
Okay. Take it away.

28:45.172 --> 28:47.474
Okay. Blood pressure?

28:47.508 --> 28:48.975
Still 110/70.

28:51.213 --> 28:54.916
Okay.
That's what I like to hear.

29:00.689 --> 29:03.057
Once the needles
penetrate the spine,

29:03.092 --> 29:04.892
they soften and grow roots.

29:04.927 --> 29:07.328
They become part of the host's
nervous system.

29:07.362 --> 29:08.730
How is that possible?

29:08.764 --> 29:09.897
Oh, you know,

29:09.932 --> 29:14.635
some sort of nano-engineering
or something.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.537
I mean,
they look like needles,

29:16.571 --> 29:19.140
but they behave
more like living tissue.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.575
It's fascinating,
actually.

29:21.609 --> 29:24.611
And that means if they wear
the harness long enough...

29:24.646 --> 29:26.480
The kid and the harness
become one.

29:29.451 --> 29:31.518
Doctor!
I got it, I got it.

29:31.553 --> 29:32.753
Come on! Do something!

29:32.787 --> 29:34.622
Get him out of here,
will you?

29:34.656 --> 29:36.156
Come on, Mike.

29:46.467 --> 29:48.368
Okay.

29:48.403 --> 29:50.437
Okay.

29:52.006 --> 29:55.241
It's all right.
I was actually expecting that.

30:05.820 --> 30:08.287
Who's there?!

30:08.322 --> 30:10.022
Dad.

30:10.056 --> 30:11.257
Hal?

30:15.161 --> 30:16.327
Dad. Oh.

30:16.362 --> 30:19.163
I got you. I got you.

30:20.398 --> 30:22.966
What happened?
Where's Karen?

30:23.001 --> 30:25.903
You drove away.

30:25.937 --> 30:28.005
Then the Mechs stunned us.

30:28.039 --> 30:32.275
Then, when I woke up...

30:32.309 --> 30:35.345
They were taking Karen
to the Skitters.

30:35.379 --> 30:36.813
She's a prisoner?

30:38.549 --> 30:40.150
You left.

30:40.185 --> 30:41.985
No. No, no. No.

30:42.020 --> 30:44.856
One of those harnessed kids
was Mike's son.

30:44.890 --> 30:47.258
He saw him, and he just --
he just grabbed him.

30:47.293 --> 30:48.893
If I didn't hit
the explosive,

30:48.928 --> 30:50.262
they both
would've been killed.

30:50.297 --> 30:52.398
And I got knocked out.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have left.

30:52.432 --> 30:55.368
I wouldn't have left.
I'm so sorry.

30:59.073 --> 31:01.975
I'm just glad you came back.

31:04.578 --> 31:07.814
I'm just glad
that you're alive.

31:07.848 --> 31:10.516
Dad...

31:10.551 --> 31:12.819
They killed those kids.

31:13.821 --> 31:15.588
Wait a minute. What kids?

31:15.623 --> 31:16.723
Ben?!

31:16.757 --> 31:17.924
No, no, not Ben.

31:17.958 --> 31:19.159
What kids?
Not Ben.

31:19.193 --> 31:20.560
The other crew.

31:21.596 --> 31:22.830
The ones with Mike's son.

31:22.864 --> 31:25.499
Yeah.
I don't know why, but...

31:25.533 --> 31:27.968
The Skitter
made the Mech kill them,

31:28.003 --> 31:30.004
and they let me go.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.674
They let you go?

31:33.708 --> 31:36.010
Yeah, it was like
they wanted me to see it.

31:36.044 --> 31:40.714
And then -- they killed them,
and they let me go.

31:42.150 --> 31:45.052
The Nazis sometimes did that
with allied prisoners of war.

31:45.086 --> 31:46.153
To send a message --

31:46.187 --> 31:47.888
take one,
and we'll kill the rest.

31:47.922 --> 31:51.358
That's why they left you alive.
You're the messenger.

31:51.392 --> 31:54.127
That means we can't
just take one kid.

31:54.161 --> 31:57.631
No, no. When we come back,
we take them all.

32:08.283 --> 32:10.851
If it was up to me,
we'd kill the damn thing now.

32:10.886 --> 32:12.386
Yeah, let's do that.

32:12.420 --> 32:14.855
Nope.

32:14.889 --> 32:18.426
We've never had
a live Skitter before.

32:18.460 --> 32:21.963
Nobody's ever had one
that I know of.

32:23.399 --> 32:25.935
And if we're gonna beat
these things, Weaver,

32:25.969 --> 32:28.004
we damn sure need
to understand them.

32:28.038 --> 32:29.238
Tom handled this one

32:29.272 --> 32:31.374
with a sawed-off shotgun
and a flashlight.

32:31.408 --> 32:32.742
What more is there
to understand?

32:32.776 --> 32:35.111
That'll be
Dr. Harris' call.

32:35.145 --> 32:36.645
Dr. Harris?

32:36.680 --> 32:38.748
I thought he was leaving
with you tonight.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.049
Nope. Change of plans.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.583
You're gonna have him
for the next three weeks.

32:41.618 --> 32:42.851
I want somebody
with a background

32:42.886 --> 32:47.255
in physiology and anatomy
to study this damn thing.

32:47.290 --> 32:50.491
And we'll always have
flashlights and shotguns.

33:04.207 --> 33:05.908
Well, don't everybody
thank me at once.

33:05.943 --> 33:09.446
Well, it's good.
Isn't it?

33:09.480 --> 33:11.849
It's not bad,
considering...

33:11.883 --> 33:13.017
Considering what?

33:13.051 --> 33:14.719
Who made it.

33:17.322 --> 33:20.991
Well, line up,
everybody!

33:23.160 --> 33:24.327
Gonna have some?

33:24.361 --> 33:25.662
Serve them first.

33:25.696 --> 33:27.997
Looks like you might be
of some use to the 2nd Mass.

33:28.031 --> 33:30.065
Yeah?
We'll give it a week.

33:30.100 --> 33:32.401
Does that mean I don't have to
be, uh, locked up anymore?

33:32.436 --> 33:33.769
It does not.
Lock him up.

33:33.803 --> 33:36.639
All right. Come on, Pope.

33:38.041 --> 33:39.608
You're not gonna
regret it!

33:39.643 --> 33:42.345
I <i>already</i> regret it.

33:42.379 --> 33:43.980
Yeah, yeah.

34:10.377 --> 34:11.744
How is he?

34:11.779 --> 34:14.447
He's stable.

34:14.482 --> 34:16.882
So it works.

34:16.918 --> 34:20.286
It seems to.
Are you okay?

34:20.321 --> 34:22.723
Yeah.
Hey, Tom.

34:26.427 --> 34:28.328
Looks like
he's gonna be okay.

34:28.362 --> 34:31.098
I'm praying.

34:31.132 --> 34:34.634
Keep an eye on him
while I step out?

34:34.668 --> 34:36.570
Of course.

34:36.603 --> 34:40.473
Why don't you sit down,
let me take a look at you?

34:41.908 --> 34:44.141
How did it go?

34:46.445 --> 34:48.847
Hal's okay.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.949
But they captured Karen.

34:51.983 --> 34:53.451
Oh, no.

34:53.485 --> 34:55.085
Lord.

34:55.119 --> 34:56.420
How's he taking it?

34:58.723 --> 35:01.459
He blames himself.

35:04.063 --> 35:06.431
I'm so sorry.
Yeah.

35:06.466 --> 35:07.933
Now we know, right?

35:07.968 --> 35:10.536
I mean, now we know...

35:10.571 --> 35:12.005
That we can take
these things off

35:12.039 --> 35:14.974
and it doesn't have to
kill them, right?

35:15.009 --> 35:17.310
Harris knows
what he's doing?

35:19.180 --> 35:21.581
Yeah. He's great.

35:21.615 --> 35:25.518
Got any idea
where I can find him?

35:33.125 --> 35:34.692
Ah.

35:34.727 --> 35:36.060
I...

35:36.094 --> 35:39.464
I got some scotch.

35:41.234 --> 35:43.168
How's the prisoner?

35:43.202 --> 35:44.936
Eh, too soon to tell.

35:44.970 --> 35:48.473
Uh, Porter wants me to stick
around a little while longer

35:48.507 --> 35:53.413
and make a fuller study
of our conquerors.

35:54.882 --> 35:56.549
Is that
what he called them?

35:56.583 --> 35:58.952
No, that's my word.

36:00.121 --> 36:01.655
We're not conquered.

36:02.824 --> 36:04.258
Unless we give up.

36:06.829 --> 36:09.764
Uh, I got too much respect
for your intelligence, Tom,

36:09.798 --> 36:14.870
to, uh, take that little display
of human vanity seriously.

36:14.905 --> 36:16.905
Well, maybe
I'm not as intelligent

36:16.940 --> 36:18.507
as you think I am.

36:18.541 --> 36:21.576
You know,
there are people

36:21.611 --> 36:22.878
who actually believe

36:22.912 --> 36:26.882
that surviving the first wave
of the invasion

36:26.917 --> 36:31.087
proves that they're
the best of mankind.

36:32.623 --> 36:34.457
Obviously you don't agree?

36:34.492 --> 36:36.292
Well...

36:36.327 --> 36:39.329
Those people who ran away

36:39.363 --> 36:41.597
or found the deepest holes
to hide in --

36:41.632 --> 36:43.766
they're the survivors.

36:43.801 --> 36:45.668
You find something
ennobling in that,

36:45.703 --> 36:48.104
I-I'd love to hear about it.

36:48.138 --> 36:51.174
Is that how <i>you</i> survived?

36:51.208 --> 36:53.042
Running away?

36:53.077 --> 36:55.344
Hiding?

36:55.379 --> 36:58.448
What do you mean?

36:58.482 --> 36:59.582
The morning of the attack,

36:59.616 --> 37:01.217
when you and Rebecca
got caught outside,

37:01.251 --> 37:05.054
you ran away and you hid.

37:05.088 --> 37:08.457
And you left her
to save yourself.

37:09.626 --> 37:11.827
I mean, I -- look.

37:11.861 --> 37:14.229
She was not with me
the morning of the attack.

37:14.264 --> 37:15.431
I told you that.

37:15.465 --> 37:18.067
I know what you told me.

37:18.101 --> 37:21.704
But when I found her,

37:21.738 --> 37:25.174
she was still holding
onto the duffel bag

37:25.208 --> 37:27.276
full of provisions that you guys
had collected,

37:27.310 --> 37:30.179
and it was much too heavy
for her to carry by herself.

37:30.213 --> 37:32.515
And that's how I know
you were with her

37:32.549 --> 37:34.083
when the attack started.

37:34.117 --> 37:37.019
Look, Tom...

37:37.053 --> 37:38.520
Please.

37:38.555 --> 37:40.956
I-I-it wasn't premeditated.

37:40.990 --> 37:44.559
It was
a split-second decision.

37:44.594 --> 37:46.260
And I-I guess I thought --

37:46.295 --> 37:48.662
What? What?

37:48.697 --> 37:50.897
Well, I guess
I thought that my --

37:50.932 --> 37:53.266
t-the community
needed my medical skills.

37:55.703 --> 37:58.371
Man.

38:01.709 --> 38:04.344
Well...

38:04.378 --> 38:05.945
I guess
you had to do that, huh?

38:05.980 --> 38:07.814
You guessed right.

38:11.718 --> 38:16.255
Well, I understand
how guilty you must feel

38:16.290 --> 38:18.190
'cause of what happened
to her.

38:19.793 --> 38:20.992
What are you talking about?

38:21.027 --> 38:23.294
Well, it was
your morning, Tom.

38:23.329 --> 38:24.729
Wasn't it?

38:26.298 --> 38:30.200
Rebecca told me that <i>you</i>
were supposed to go out there

38:30.235 --> 38:33.036
looking for food with me
that morning.

38:33.071 --> 38:35.739
But she knew
how exhausted you were,

38:35.773 --> 38:39.176
and she couldn't bring herself
to wake you up.

38:40.512 --> 38:43.781
She really loved you, Tom.

38:43.816 --> 38:46.184
But it should have been you out
there the morning of the attack

38:46.219 --> 38:47.352
and not Rebecca.

38:47.387 --> 38:49.655
You're as responsible
for her death as I am --

38:49.690 --> 38:51.558
maybe more.

38:51.592 --> 38:53.960
And because I'm alive,

38:53.995 --> 38:58.332
you've got a chance to get
that harness off your son.

38:58.366 --> 39:02.770
Rebecca's death
may save Ben's life.

39:11.279 --> 39:13.481
The Skitters won't win.

39:15.517 --> 39:18.319
Well, we'll see.

39:20.823 --> 39:22.824
And no matter
how each of us survived,

39:22.858 --> 39:25.827
maybe we owe it
to those who didn't...

39:25.861 --> 39:30.065
to <i>become</i>
the best of mankind.
