00:34.307 --> 00:35.740
NARRATOR: In the 11th century,

00:35.747 --> 00:38.080
Europe was a patchwork
of feudal states,

00:38.052 --> 00:42.081
extending from the
Mediterranean to the North Sea.

00:41.990 --> 00:44.721
Powerful dukes exerted
life-and-death control...

00:44.679 --> 00:46.647
over their primitive subjects.

00:46.631 --> 00:51.502
One such, Duke William of Ghent,
held a coastal area in Normandy.

00:51.369 --> 00:55.101
To protect the marshes of a
troubled corner of his domain,

00:55.018 --> 00:58.352
the Duke sent warriors led
by his most trusted knight,

00:58.283 --> 01:00.582
Chrysagon de la Cruex.

01:00.556 --> 01:03.924
This Norman warlord was charged
to impose the Duke's will...

01:03.853 --> 01:06.482
on his vassals and to protect
their settlements...

01:06.446 --> 01:08.938
from Frisian raiders,
who crossed the waters...

01:08.911 --> 01:10.572
to plunder and pillage.

02:50.352 --> 02:54.688
MAN: Hey-oh!
United tower.

02:54.579 --> 02:58.038
From here to the sea
and beyond, it's yours.

02:57.972 --> 02:59.132
Mine.

02:59.156 --> 03:00.886
SECOND MAN:
From here to the sea.

03:00.885 --> 03:05.051
We're pilgrims to nowhere,
and we have arrived.

03:04.950 --> 03:08.149
What's the matter, Draco?
Your belly hurt?

03:08.088 --> 03:10.318
- L, Milord?
- What is it, Brother?

03:10.296 --> 03:11.855
What did you expect?

03:11.865 --> 03:14.994
Whatever you want.
Your wish is mine.

03:14.938 --> 03:17.601
For myself, I expect nothing.

03:18.235 --> 03:20.204
[Birds squawking]

03:31.263 --> 03:33.164
Queer, moody place.

03:33.152 --> 03:34.814
Still, it's mine.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.811
Given by the Duke himself.

03:37.794 --> 03:40.787
A holding no man
in all Christendom wanted.

03:41.731 --> 03:43.062
I want it.

03:43.075 --> 03:46.274
You have it,
and you'll keep it, Brother,

03:46.213 --> 03:47.840
as the Lord kept Israel.

04:54.235 --> 04:57.296
This place has
the dimensions of heresy.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.566
[Horn sounds]

05:00.574 --> 05:01.768
[Birds screeching]

05:02.399 --> 05:05.995
[Horn sounds]

05:05.920 --> 05:07.217
An alarm.

05:08.449 --> 05:09.939
Raiders from the sea.

05:23.078 --> 05:24.306
Frisian raiders!

05:24.326 --> 05:27.319
They've sacked the village,
taking women to the boats now!

05:49.455 --> 05:52.687
RAIDER: Peasant pigs!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

06:22.106 --> 06:23.505
Charge!

06:29.276 --> 06:31.438
Norman! Norman!

06:41.024 --> 06:42.356
Father!

06:53.572 --> 06:55.972
- De la Cruex!
- You.

07:33.041 --> 07:36.705
CHRYSAGON: Frisian butcher!
I warn you...

08:14.368 --> 08:16.064
Aah!

08:22.786 --> 08:24.755
You are bloodied, Chrysagon.

08:26.275 --> 08:28.403
I had him, Draco.

08:28.388 --> 08:30.880
I had him in my fist,
and I lost him.,

08:36.296 --> 08:38.594
There's no one else
worth ransom?

08:38.568 --> 08:41.538
There's only one prince
of the Frisians.

09:20.566 --> 09:24.765
So, they bring their heathen
brats along to show them murder.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.755
Here's your lesson, boy.

09:27.736 --> 09:30.262
Hold your hand, Bors.
Let me have him.

09:30.234 --> 09:31.326
Why?

09:31.354 --> 09:33.619
I'll make a page of him,
and being a page,

09:33.594 --> 09:35.062
he'll make a lord of me.

09:38.717 --> 09:40.811
He will sting you with this.

09:41.725 --> 09:45.856
Where would such a scurvy
ship's boy steal such a blade?

10:15.945 --> 10:17.071
You the village elder?

10:17.098 --> 10:20.694
My name Odins,
and this is my son Marc.

10:23.243 --> 10:24.768
You took that from a Frisian?

10:24.781 --> 10:27.410
Aye, Lord. I fought.

10:38.961 --> 10:40.622
Where are the men
of the garrison?

10:40.625 --> 10:45.223
- Gone, Lord.
- What do you mean, gone? Killed?

10:45.107 --> 10:48.373
- I mean gone.
- And the warden? Dead?

10:48.308 --> 10:50.800
Last night I saw him
very much alive.

11:06.523 --> 11:10.824
Methinks we've got a seigneur
instead of a warden in a tower.

11:10.716 --> 11:12.275
What difference?

11:12.285 --> 11:15.414
- This'n saved thee.
- This'n can also hang thee.

11:15.357 --> 11:17.485
- So could Tava.
- This'n has the right.

11:17.470 --> 11:19.199
But he's a great knight.

11:19.198 --> 11:21.064
20 years in the wars,
the priest said.

11:21.984 --> 11:24.146
Our lord he is.

11:24.128 --> 11:27.929
Our lord, perhaps,
but not our master.

11:27.841 --> 11:30.640
Nor master of the stone,
nor the tree.

12:07.792 --> 12:10.284
- Milord?
- Good father.

12:10.257 --> 12:12.350
Sir Chrysagon de la Cruex?

12:13.585 --> 12:15.554
Hugo de Bouillion, Milord.

12:15.538 --> 12:18.006
Servant of God.

12:20.915 --> 12:24.375
My, uh, my flock, Sire.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.834
Your vassals.

12:25.845 --> 12:31.080
A simple people,
but pious in their fashion.

12:30.936 --> 12:33.838
They were druids here
before Caesar's day.

12:33.784 --> 12:37.653
Mere children who revered,
in all innocence,

12:37.562 --> 12:40.293
the customs of their fathers
before them.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.515
Customs of the devil,
sir priest.

12:42.491 --> 12:44.550
Not so, good sire.

12:44.539 --> 12:50.002
Not so? To think such faceless
brutes could sway a priest.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.414
Oh, they have faces.

12:52.382 --> 12:54.374
The all look much alike to me.

14:01.142 --> 14:03.873
CHRYSAGON: That doorway
has no protection.

14:05.048 --> 14:06.607
No protection at all.

15:05.164 --> 15:06.324
It stinks.

15:07.244 --> 15:09.179
CHRYSAGON:
You could find it blindfolded.

15:09.165 --> 15:11.100
PRIEST: The raiders...

15:11.086 --> 15:13.554
CHRYSAGON: It stank before
the raiders came.

15:15.503 --> 15:17.995
My men marched 20 miles today.

15:17.968 --> 15:20.028
Now they must sleep in this.

15:20.017 --> 15:22.508
PRIEST: Milord, when the Duke's
messenger told our warden of...

15:22.482 --> 15:27.046
his removal,
he grew somewhat lax.

15:26.932 --> 15:29.902
CHRYSAGON: I knew him in court.
He was somewhat lax then.

15:51.932 --> 15:54.993
A little... disordered, I fear.

16:15.908 --> 16:19.037
CHRYSAGON: Where is he now,
your lax warden?

16:18.981 --> 16:23.442
It is to be hoped in Heaven,
but I doubt it.

16:24.006 --> 16:25.838
Your quarters, Milord.

16:35.434 --> 16:37.403
[Bird squawks]

16:42.253 --> 16:45.951
He was always chasing
some goose girl up a hayrick.

16:49.007 --> 16:50.498
He was bewitched.

16:51.216 --> 16:53.742
Carried off by devils, he was.

16:55.601 --> 16:58.070
These people here
have ancient customs...

16:58.034 --> 17:00.401
in which he may
unthinkingly have joined.

17:02.260 --> 17:03.727
The tree and the stone?

17:04.660 --> 17:06.185
Worshipping the devil?

17:06.196 --> 17:10.430
PRIEST: No. He damned
the devil's flesh,

17:10.326 --> 17:12.295
but women's flesh he loved,

17:12.279 --> 17:15.738
and devils dearly
love to masquerade.

17:17.433 --> 17:18.422
Priest...

17:21.402 --> 17:23.564
are you saying she was a witch?

17:23.547 --> 17:24.513
Witch?

17:30.781 --> 17:34.309
White flowers.
What is this?

17:34.238 --> 17:36.571
PRIEST: Her bridal wreath.

17:36.543 --> 17:39.536
Come, Sir Priest.
Was she a witch or a bride?

17:39.488 --> 17:41.514
A virgin bride.

17:42.305 --> 17:43.500
The warden's?

17:43.522 --> 17:45.114
A villager's.

17:46.979 --> 17:48.207
God's grace.

17:50.884 --> 17:55.619
Bee among the flowers.
The mark of death.

17:55.494 --> 17:57.394
[Screech]

18:01.608 --> 18:04.908
There must be willing girls in
this place enough for any man.

18:04.841 --> 18:06.308
Why took he a virgin?

18:08.554 --> 18:11.353
"Keep their good will,"
the Duke told me.

18:12.139 --> 18:17.169
Him before me,
this rapacious bastard.

18:17.037 --> 18:18.699
Small loss when
the Frisians killed him.

18:18.702 --> 18:22.434
Milord, it was not rape.

18:22.351 --> 18:25.412
They liked the warden well.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.421
- Who liked him?
- These people here.

18:28.369 --> 18:31.862
In olden times,
they sanctified a marriage...

18:31.794 --> 18:34.025
by giving the bride
on her wedding night...

18:34.003 --> 18:36.234
Bors, burn that bed.

19:20.003 --> 19:24.373
Devils... devils.

19:24.260 --> 19:25.557
PRIEST: Yes, yes.

19:25.572 --> 19:28.737
Our fens and marshes attract
them in great quantity.

19:28.678 --> 19:30.475
l, with these eyes,
have seen them.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.632
I speak of different devils.

19:33.223 --> 19:34.452
The Frisians.

19:34.472 --> 19:37.840
Oh, yes, yes, Lord.

19:37.769 --> 19:40.534
Might I offer you
some meager food and drink?

19:40.490 --> 19:42.981
- They'll be back.
- I daresay, Lord.

19:42.954 --> 19:46.949
Their land lies North across
the sea but two days distance.

19:48.460 --> 19:51.021
- I cannot...
- I know where their land lies.

19:54.542 --> 19:58.036
PRIEST: And they do raid
our coast this time of year.

19:57.968 --> 19:58.900
I have a green cheese...

19:58.928 --> 20:01.022
Next time I'll hold him fast...

20:01.009 --> 20:02.271
Two fishes, a garlic soup...

20:02.289 --> 20:03.917
as he held my father.

20:05.138 --> 20:06.230
Father?

20:08.915 --> 20:12.113
Taken in battle by Frisians,
I've been told.

20:12.051 --> 20:14.350
And stripped bare.

20:14.324 --> 20:18.193
Most extortionate ransom.
They are a harsh people.

20:18.102 --> 20:22.473
He came home broken,
and died so. A pauper knight.

20:22.360 --> 20:25.524
It must be hard to lose
your lands, I'm sure.

20:25.465 --> 20:26.432
We lost all.

20:27.673 --> 20:29.470
It was a long time ago.

20:31.835 --> 20:33.133
A lifetime.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.445
What were you saying?

20:34.460 --> 20:36.156
- I said...
- Tell me at table.

20:36.157 --> 20:38.717
We'll gnaw bone tonight
and hunt tomorrow.

20:38.685 --> 20:41.553
Thank you, Milord.
You'll enjoy our forest.

20:41.502 --> 20:44.563
There's deer, wild fowl,
and tusky boar.

21:21.355 --> 21:22.687
[Woman screams]

21:25.005 --> 21:28.032
Down, dogs! Down!

21:27.982 --> 21:31.511
Down dogs! Get off! Get off!

21:31.439 --> 21:34.933
Be still, woman.
They won't hurt you. Get off!

21:37.041 --> 21:38.509
She's all right.

21:38.514 --> 21:40.175
Counts as a kill, though.

21:41.779 --> 21:45.716
Come on, pig girl.
It's never as bad as all that.

21:45.620 --> 21:48.249
Pig girl? No eyes
in your head, man?

21:48.213 --> 21:49.442
WOMAN: Aah!

21:51.350 --> 21:54.320
Here's the pelt,
and there's the otter!

21:56.856 --> 21:59.519
I told you I want no trouble
with these people.

21:59.481 --> 22:01.177
Handle them softly, I said.

22:01.177 --> 22:04.147
Just what I was
going to do, Milord.

22:04.826 --> 22:08.490
You are out to hunt, dog.
Get on with it!

22:09.724 --> 22:11.191
All of you!

22:26.401 --> 22:28.370
[Dogs barking]

22:37.894 --> 22:39.089
Are you hurt?

22:39.719 --> 22:41.482
Ah, nothing much.

22:49.290 --> 22:50.622
Say your name.

22:51.818 --> 22:53.183
Bronwyn, Milord.

22:54.316 --> 22:55.578
From the village?

22:57.805 --> 22:59.273
I own the village.

23:00.686 --> 23:01.983
I know, Milord.

23:02.831 --> 23:04.526
What house?

23:04.527 --> 23:06.621
Odins, Milord. The elder.

23:06.608 --> 23:08.907
- His foster child.
- Speak up, girl!

23:09.937 --> 23:11.599
May I dress myself, Milord?

23:16.275 --> 23:17.436
Yes.

23:24.566 --> 23:26.159
Are you going to watch me?

23:29.271 --> 23:30.568
Yes.

23:35.322 --> 23:38.121
- Are you cold?
- No.

23:38.747 --> 23:42.149
- You afraid?
- Yes.

23:42.075 --> 23:44.806
Why? I'm gentle
with horses, hawks.

23:49.727 --> 23:50.955
Come here.

23:53.183 --> 23:54.650
Come here.

23:57.826 --> 23:59.293
[Bee buzzes]

24:05.860 --> 24:08.762
- What is this?
- A wedding garland.

24:13.543 --> 24:15.010
And you're a virgin?

24:52.627 --> 24:53.856
MAN: Bronwyn.

24:56.917 --> 24:58.646
What happened to you?

24:58.645 --> 25:01.979
He did nothing.
A bee stung him.

25:03.031 --> 25:04.259
He?

25:06.840 --> 25:09.105
I fell in the water.

25:09.082 --> 25:10.549
And he did nothing?

25:12.667 --> 25:15.102
- They were hunting.
- Who?

25:15.067 --> 25:16.659
Lord Chrysagon.

25:16.668 --> 25:17.966
And he did not touch you?

25:23.039 --> 25:25.599
Am I hurting you by
asking these questions?

25:26.176 --> 25:27.643
Then why do you weep?

25:28.960 --> 25:31.121
Marc, I love you.

25:31.104 --> 25:33.005
I have since
your father took me in.

25:34.722 --> 25:36.314
Stay away from him.

25:37.380 --> 25:38.677
Yes, Marc.

25:43.173 --> 25:45.164
Stay away from him!

25:45.445 --> 25:47.107
[Bird chirping]

25:50.120 --> 25:52.089
[Laughter]

25:53.609 --> 25:55.771
God's great fist, I can see him.

25:55.753 --> 25:58.348
Milord and brother.

25:58.315 --> 26:01.183
Planting himself in front of her
and staring her down.

26:01.132 --> 26:02.656
Giving her battle orders.

26:02.668 --> 26:04.864
You go, wheel around.

26:04.844 --> 26:07.746
Keep your flanks covered,
pull up your breastplate.

26:07.693 --> 26:10.026
Your rear echelon's exposed!

26:11.982 --> 26:13.712
[Laughter stops]

26:27.892 --> 26:29.723
BORS:
You haven't removed your shirt.

26:29.716 --> 26:31.651
That's why the wound frets you.

26:31.637 --> 26:32.729
CHRYSAGON: Frets me?

26:32.757 --> 26:34.316
You fret me like an old woman.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.295
Told you it's a scratch,
nothing more.

26:36.280 --> 26:39.546
Fester, then, in flame.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.426
DRACO: You have
a fever, Brother?

26:43.417 --> 26:44.783
Can't sleep.

26:44.794 --> 26:48.629
Maybe you took it from
that girl at the pond.

26:53.405 --> 26:54.668
DRACO: What's she like?

26:54.685 --> 26:57.280
Oh, I don't know.

26:57.247 --> 27:04.314
A woman, tan hair,
breasts, belly, legs.

27:04.096 --> 27:05.530
A woman.

27:05.538 --> 27:07.199
She has a calm face.

27:07.202 --> 27:10.695
So has a cow.
How was she?

27:13.732 --> 27:14.893
I let her go.

27:14.916 --> 27:16.440
You let her go?

27:16.453 --> 27:19.321
Small wonder
you can't sleep. Why?

27:23.463 --> 27:26.194
There's a strangeness
in this place.

27:26.153 --> 27:28.087
I felt it since
first we came here.

27:28.809 --> 27:31.779
Nonetheless,
I thought, mine.

27:33.227 --> 27:34.559
Poor place.

27:35.499 --> 27:40.336
Marsh, naked tower,
the world's end, almost.

27:40.205 --> 27:42.800
But to have it, to hold it...

27:42.765 --> 27:44.165
If only...

27:47.311 --> 27:49.473
What do you think of this land?

27:50.544 --> 27:52.536
Dung heap.

27:52.529 --> 27:55.465
You deserve better...
much better.

27:55.410 --> 27:56.877
What say you, Bors?

27:56.883 --> 27:59.352
You are my lord.

27:59.316 --> 28:01.376
This land serves you,
I serve you.

28:01.364 --> 28:03.959
But if it should be
a land unholy?

28:03.925 --> 28:05.392
Here.

28:05.397 --> 28:07.764
Do you feel nothing,
hear nothing, see nothing?

28:07.734 --> 28:11.262
I feel bored.
I hear the wind.

28:11.192 --> 28:14.128
I see fever burning holes
in your head.

28:16.377 --> 28:17.537
Silence.

28:19.098 --> 28:20.588
That speaks of spells.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.648
BOORS: Ah...
DRACO: Bors?

28:28.445 --> 28:32.405
Sire, all men have heard
how when the Lord Christ came,

28:32.319 --> 28:35.950
the old Gods, demons,
and spirits with snaky hair...

28:35.872 --> 28:37.499
were cast down into hell.

28:37.504 --> 28:38.836
Good riddance!

28:38.850 --> 28:41.114
But some say they still linger,

28:41.089 --> 28:44.184
prowling the dark corners and
unblessed places of the earth,

28:44.130 --> 28:47.362
changed to beggar men
and goose girls.

28:47.299 --> 28:49.791
Bors, you surprise me.

28:49.765 --> 28:51.393
You've produced a thought.

28:52.549 --> 28:54.279
BORS: God help the man
who meets one.

28:55.046 --> 28:57.038
The blood in his heart changes.

28:57.448 --> 29:00.748
And what of that
devil's dish he met today?

29:00.681 --> 29:02.616
She's the cause of his fever,
and that's the truth.

29:03.529 --> 29:05.998
- How so?
- Because you let her go.

29:13.452 --> 29:17.254
DRACO: Bors...
you know who she is?

29:18.894 --> 29:21.523
Find out from Rainault,
put her to work in the kitchen.

29:22.256 --> 29:23.747
[Grumbles]

29:24.496 --> 29:28.867
Why waste her charm on pigs
when there's use for it here?

29:30.130 --> 29:31.758
Oink! Ha ha!

29:57.307 --> 29:58.775
[Man groans]

30:00.028 --> 30:01.326
[Horse neighs]

31:35.421 --> 31:37.048
BORS: Come here!

31:42.431 --> 31:44.229
[Door squeaks shut]

31:44.224 --> 31:45.885
BORS: Now, girl...

31:45.888 --> 31:49.121
you will take his arms
and hold him firm while I...

31:52.707 --> 31:54.368
Lie flat, Milord.

31:57.029 --> 31:58.327
Here!

32:01.510 --> 32:03.341
You will hold him here and here.

32:03.943 --> 32:06.537
He will plunge
like a gelded colt.

32:08.072 --> 32:09.540
I did.

32:10.633 --> 32:11.759
Take him.

32:15.947 --> 32:18.245
BORS: A trick I learned
from a heathen Moor.

32:18.219 --> 32:20.518
If a wench holds him,
he doesn't kick.

32:20.492 --> 32:22.222
Pride of manhood, I suppose.

32:23.437 --> 32:26.771
Take 10 men to hold Milord...
or one woman.

32:33.361 --> 32:36.854
Sire, I shall count to five.

32:47.830 --> 32:49.058
[Sizzling]

32:49.846 --> 32:50.973
One...

32:52.087 --> 32:53.179
two...

32:54.968 --> 32:56.026
three...

32:58.329 --> 32:59.456
four...

33:01.210 --> 33:02.337
five.

33:30.084 --> 33:31.312
[Door shuts]

33:44.681 --> 33:48.140
[Bird squawking]

33:52.844 --> 33:54.209
[Falcon chirps]

33:57.069 --> 33:58.537
[Bird squawks]

34:01.551 --> 34:03.416
DRACO: Volc,
call him down here.

34:04.784 --> 34:06.547
Damned falcon
never knows what he wants.

34:07.153 --> 34:09.087
VOLC: They're human that way.

34:09.072 --> 34:12.271
DRACO: You know less
about falcons than a flea.

34:13.235 --> 34:17.400
To train a falcon, you need
a larger brain than a falcon.

34:20.245 --> 34:22.679
VOLC: Come down here
or I'll wring your neck.

34:22.646 --> 34:25.309
Damn me, but just look
at Sir Flea bristle.

34:26.071 --> 34:27.505
[Horse neighs]

34:40.411 --> 34:43.382
[Volc laughing]

34:43.324 --> 34:44.793
I'll kill him.

34:47.005 --> 34:49.373
I'll kill them both!

34:50.047 --> 34:53.746
I'll twist your nose
with the slack in your belly.

35:08.934 --> 35:10.401
I'm sorry.

35:30.509 --> 35:33.843
CHRYSAGON: Draco, Draco...

35:38.864 --> 35:42.824
Draco! Draco!

35:53.269 --> 35:54.736
[Horse neighs]

36:02.360 --> 36:03.828
Ya!

36:10.075 --> 36:11.975
[Horse neighs]

36:27.681 --> 36:30.617
[Horse grunts]

36:45.286 --> 36:46.913
Don't run from me.

36:49.928 --> 36:51.863
- Is that poppy?
- Yes.

37:01.772 --> 37:03.570
What do you want with this?

37:03.565 --> 37:05.089
We call it hawk's eye.

37:05.100 --> 37:06.659
We get chamomile from it
for seasoning.

37:08.014 --> 37:10.813
It also has the power
to rob men's minds.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.116
Like magic.

37:17.042 --> 37:20.638
- And it can kill.
- Oh, no magic.

37:20.562 --> 37:22.325
My foster father heals
with these herbs.

37:24.564 --> 37:27.261
- Purple foxglove.
- For lovesickness.

37:27.221 --> 37:29.452
Three leaves or four
can stop the heart.

37:29.430 --> 37:31.364
- Witchery.
- No, Milord.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.444
Not witchery.

37:33.431 --> 37:34.763
They all kill.

37:58.112 --> 37:59.875
What's that?

37:59.872 --> 38:03.502
Mistletoe, the golden bow that
twines around the sacred oak.

38:05.762 --> 38:07.492
Why is the oak sacred?

38:07.491 --> 38:09.152
It's connected to the gods.

38:09.155 --> 38:11.124
- You believe that?
- Yes.

38:12.356 --> 38:14.382
Before I came,
they told me that...

38:14.373 --> 38:18.208
marsh people had spotted bellies
and webbed toes.

38:18.118 --> 38:21.317
- You believe that?
- Not since I saw you...

38:21.255 --> 38:22.723
in the lake.

38:35.404 --> 38:37.498
CHRYSAGON:
We'll lie under that tree.

38:37.485 --> 38:40.853
- No.
- I feel good about you.

38:40.781 --> 38:41.908
I've been fighting all year.

38:41.935 --> 38:44.403
I haven't had time
to lie under trees.

38:44.366 --> 38:47.393
- Let me go.
- I fought last year, too.

38:47.343 --> 38:49.938
I haven't even seen
a girl with tan hair.

38:49.905 --> 38:51.237
I'm tired of fighting.

38:51.249 --> 38:54.219
- Milord, l...
- Shh. Don't talk, Witch.

39:15.322 --> 39:16.950
Have pity.

39:19.194 --> 39:21.322
[Birds squawk]

39:24.189 --> 39:26.090
[Wings flapping]

39:49.958 --> 39:51.425
This is not lawful.

39:52.550 --> 39:55.679
DRACO: You want to serve
in this troop? Ha! Ha!

39:55.624 --> 39:58.219
I want to be Milord's man.

39:58.185 --> 40:02.282
People of your tribe
cannot bear arms.

40:02.186 --> 40:04.815
Besides, you have
no skill with weapons.

40:11.597 --> 40:14.123
RAINAULT: I found poachers
in the glen, sire.

40:14.093 --> 40:15.823
PRIEST: They are not
poachers, Milord.

40:15.823 --> 40:17.552
DRACO:
With a pair of stags, Rainault.

40:18.928 --> 40:20.896
DRACO: You said two.
RAINAULT: Yes, sire.

40:20.880 --> 40:23.315
These stags were dead
already, Milord,

40:23.280 --> 40:24.748
Iocked together by the horns.

40:25.874 --> 40:28.639
They needed the meat, surely.

40:28.594 --> 40:32.497
The Frisians slaughtered
most of the livestock.

40:32.404 --> 40:35.465
That be truth.
Frisians killed our pigs.

40:35.412 --> 40:38.405
DRACO: And so they poach.

40:38.358 --> 40:40.156
Woodlands belong to the lord.

40:40.151 --> 40:42.712
They should carry the stump
of the right hand in the left.

40:42.680 --> 40:44.774
The woodland belongs
to the duke.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.887
We keep it for him.

40:46.873 --> 40:48.705
We keep the peace here, too.

40:51.130 --> 40:53.656
CHRYSAGON: We share
Lord Draco's outrage.

40:53.628 --> 40:56.256
To kill the duke's deer
is a great crime.

40:57.756 --> 41:00.658
- But there is no proof.
- Proof?

41:01.534 --> 41:04.971
- It is my opinion...
- L, too, hold opinions!

41:04.895 --> 41:07.558
- I am a knight!
- I can write letters!

41:07.519 --> 41:09.351
- The devil's tools!
- Enough!

41:11.490 --> 41:13.583
Beware, Milord.

41:13.569 --> 41:17.063
Another time, your compassion
might be mistaken for weakness.

41:19.844 --> 41:22.176
There will not be another time.

41:51.151 --> 41:52.141
You, Volc!

41:53.232 --> 41:56.259
What are you doing
with that boy?

41:56.209 --> 41:57.699
Why, training him, sire.

41:57.712 --> 41:59.078
It's the only way.

42:13.878 --> 42:15.779
Keep to the tower now, boy.

42:18.905 --> 42:20.372
BORS: Lord!

42:23.385 --> 42:25.547
BORS: Milord has spent
the morning on you.

42:25.531 --> 42:27.089
Don't waste his time.

42:30.237 --> 42:31.898
MAN: I speak for
my son, Marc,

42:31.901 --> 42:34.132
who humbly beseeches
our lord's grace...

42:34.110 --> 42:35.577
and consent to wed.

42:41.888 --> 42:43.480
To this girl?

42:43.488 --> 42:45.753
The foster daughter of my house,
called Bronwyn.

42:49.091 --> 42:51.185
When?

42:51.171 --> 42:53.606
- Tomorrow, Milord.
- So soon?

42:53.573 --> 42:55.370
They've been promised
since childhood.

42:55.364 --> 42:56.923
It's time, Lord.

43:00.455 --> 43:03.220
I give leave to
your son to wed.

43:03.176 --> 43:04.643
MAN: We thank thee.

43:34.385 --> 43:37.447
Work on the moat goes well,
but the drawbridge...

43:37.396 --> 43:38.658
Blacksmith here
says to tell you...

43:38.676 --> 43:41.271
No more now!
Get him out!

43:42.388 --> 43:43.856
Ah!

44:04.285 --> 44:06.310
[Thunder]

44:08.957 --> 44:11.654
[Dogs whine and bark]

44:27.364 --> 44:29.298
Bones of the saints!

44:29.284 --> 44:30.684
What's wrong with you?

44:38.599 --> 44:41.433
- Is it the wench?
- Draco, enough!

44:41.385 --> 44:43.946
I'm only saying,
if you want her, take her.

44:43.914 --> 44:45.780
- I told you...
- It's not my business.

44:45.770 --> 44:47.567
You don't eye a woman every day.

44:47.563 --> 44:48.963
CHRYSAGON: She marries tomorrow.

44:48.972 --> 44:50.804
Why not tonight?

44:50.797 --> 44:53.129
She's not a she-goat, Draco.

44:53.100 --> 44:55.535
I won't take a woman
the night before her wedding.

44:56.173 --> 44:58.768
You're right.
It's wrong tonight.

44:58.735 --> 45:00.727
I could bite my tongue.

45:01.616 --> 45:03.244
What about tomorrow?

45:04.497 --> 45:07.729
Get... what's his name,
the priest.

45:13.588 --> 45:16.888
DRACO: Sir pri-iest!

45:16.821 --> 45:18.119
You have the right.

45:18.134 --> 45:19.362
The wedding's tomorrow...

45:19.381 --> 45:21.850
The right of the first night.
Ask the priest.

45:26.264 --> 45:29.200
Of the seven golden
virtues, I swear,

45:29.145 --> 45:32.707
the most peculiar is chastity.

45:32.634 --> 45:35.103
Look, you're the lord
of this place.

45:35.068 --> 45:36.501
She belongs to this place.

45:36.507 --> 45:37.668
Therefore, she's yours.

45:39.388 --> 45:40.856
Ask him.

45:44.446 --> 45:49.476
DRACO: Dear learned priest,
we need your counsel.

45:49.344 --> 45:51.539
PRIEST: Such as I have to give.

45:51.520 --> 45:54.649
DRACO: Are you well-versed
in church law, father?

45:54.593 --> 45:57.962
Middling well, though my order
runs not to law.

45:57.891 --> 45:59.518
It seeks rather
to make amends...

45:59.523 --> 46:03.051
for the evils wrought by men
through the absence of love.

46:02.980 --> 46:06.109
Splendid. It is of love
that I would ask you.

46:06.919 --> 46:08.352
DRACO: Now...

46:08.358 --> 46:13.457
this noble knight
has need of innocent pleasure.

46:13.320 --> 46:15.983
There is no such thing
as innocent pleasure.

46:15.945 --> 46:19.473
Priest, scholar,
certainly you have heard...

46:19.403 --> 46:20.836
of the right of the seigneur...

46:20.842 --> 46:23.311
to take a virgin bride
on her wedding night.

46:23.275 --> 46:25.471
The church does not admit it.

46:25.452 --> 46:29.719
- It is pagan law.
- These are pagan lands.

46:29.614 --> 46:32.015
Not of a Sunday morning,
I assure you.

46:31.983 --> 46:33.508
These are evening matters.

46:34.127 --> 46:37.291
We found the warden
with a bride in his arms.

46:37.232 --> 46:39.394
Was she not freely given
by her people?

46:39.377 --> 46:40.810
The warden...

46:40.817 --> 46:42.945
DRACO: What do they say
in Rome?

46:42.930 --> 46:44.922
Juste primi noctes.

46:44.915 --> 46:46.439
That being the Roman for it.

46:46.451 --> 46:48.613
You hear that?
It's known in Rome.

46:48.596 --> 46:50.427
And damned as heresy.

46:51.733 --> 46:53.360
And yet...

46:54.230 --> 46:57.689
- And yet...
- Speak on, good father.

46:57.623 --> 47:00.388
Well, now, fertility.

47:00.345 --> 47:02.576
Some say it's pagan.

47:02.553 --> 47:04.783
But who's not pagan
in some matters?

47:04.761 --> 47:06.593
True, true!

47:06.586 --> 47:08.214
I love the speech of scholars.

47:08.219 --> 47:11.781
Young folks think only
of frolicking.

47:11.708 --> 47:13.505
Desist, I tell them.

47:13.500 --> 47:15.833
But they will go a-wantoning.

47:15.806 --> 47:17.331
So, lest the devil take them,

47:17.342 --> 47:19.937
I preach them a text
from Holy Writ.

47:19.904 --> 47:21.929
"Increase and multiply,"
I say,

47:21.920 --> 47:23.912
"replenish the Earth."

47:23.904 --> 47:26.806
And oh, how they obey me.

47:28.129 --> 47:31.623
But how this touches on
your problem...

47:31.555 --> 47:34.046
Oh, clearly, clearly!

47:34.019 --> 47:36.147
The pagan part may
honor pagan law.

47:36.132 --> 47:39.796
We ask no more.
What hour's the wedding?

47:39.718 --> 47:42.847
The wedding in church
or t'other?

47:42.790 --> 47:45.453
What other?
We'll be at the church.

47:47.753 --> 47:52.317
To claim that right?
War lords, forebear!

47:52.203 --> 47:55.571
In this weak hand
lie lightnings, and I use them.

47:55.499 --> 47:59.527
- Ah, no, no sacrilege.
- Not in God's church.

48:16.563 --> 48:20.500
I dare say, there's another
wedding... their tribal way.

48:20.404 --> 48:22.373
That wedding's theirs.

48:22.356 --> 48:26.851
Feasting, drinking,
clowning, dancing...

48:26.741 --> 48:29.370
Oh, Lords, how they do caper.

48:42.715 --> 48:44.376
Aar!

50:23.837 --> 50:25.305
[Speaking foreign language]

51:16.207 --> 51:17.800
[Revelry stops]

51:30.548 --> 51:32.016
Hold the boy.

51:37.591 --> 51:39.456
ODINS: You come to do
us honor, Milord.

51:41.240 --> 51:42.707
To claim my right.

51:43.961 --> 51:46.931
[People mumbling]

51:52.891 --> 51:56.259
- He has the right.
- No!

51:56.189 --> 51:57.656
BORS: Silence!

52:00.798 --> 52:03.097
- No!
- Let it be, my own son.

52:03.679 --> 52:05.147
ODINS: He has the right.

52:10.177 --> 52:12.578
Not by his law, but by ours.

52:17.956 --> 52:18.924
Ours.

52:19.525 --> 52:23.792
Long before the Norman came,
with his church and his tower,

52:23.686 --> 52:25.985
we worshipped at
the stone and tree.

52:26.727 --> 52:30.392
And in the fields,
we plant holy seeds.

52:30.313 --> 52:32.975
Then, as now,
a virgin sacrifice...

52:32.937 --> 52:35.202
was made for the fertility
of our earth...

52:35.178 --> 52:37.647
and the enrichment
of our tribe.

52:37.611 --> 52:39.580
To take her your way is rape.

52:46.094 --> 52:49.189
It should be done our way...
the old way.

52:49.135 --> 52:50.295
You accept this?

52:57.362 --> 52:59.296
With a ring of fire.

52:59.282 --> 53:01.308
The sacred way of the Druids.
You accept this?

53:03.892 --> 53:05.360
I do.

53:06.901 --> 53:08.699
Prepare then a high place.

53:10.006 --> 53:12.100
I have a high place.

53:12.087 --> 53:16.752
Make it ready...
and your men wearing iron.

53:17.304 --> 53:20.138
Wearing iron, Norman lord,
and standing.

53:23.547 --> 53:27.348
As the moon rises,
the virgin bride...

53:27.259 --> 53:28.693
shall be brought to you.

53:30.109 --> 53:31.406
ODINS: But hold!

53:32.030 --> 53:35.057
At the rising of the sun,
I will reclaim her.

53:39.232 --> 53:40.962
So be it.

54:11.915 --> 54:13.781
[Whispers a prayer]

56:43.934 --> 56:46.733
ODINS: I go to wait
the rising of the sun.

57:15.338 --> 57:17.136
You weep?

57:17.130 --> 57:20.032
- No, be still.
- Yes, Milord.

57:19.979 --> 57:24.110
Milord. Milord speaks
and all obey.

57:24.012 --> 57:25.742
Is that not what you want?

57:26.189 --> 57:29.489
I want you to be free
to go or stay as you will.

57:30.511 --> 57:31.945
But I fear you'd go, so...

57:33.167 --> 57:34.533
Look at me!

57:35.953 --> 57:37.785
I have the right to take you.

57:38.513 --> 57:39.639
I have the right.

57:49.237 --> 57:50.363
You want me to go?

57:51.317 --> 57:55.085
Go... back to your pigs,

57:54.999 --> 57:56.591
your strange, damn people,

57:56.600 --> 57:59.365
your death-sucking bees, yes!

57:59.321 --> 58:01.290
Go, and let me go.

58:03.963 --> 58:05.260
Go!

58:09.243 --> 58:10.370
Wait.

58:12.444 --> 58:13.742
I want...

58:18.847 --> 58:22.147
I need you as I need breath...

58:23.169 --> 58:26.833
sunshine, fire in winter.

58:28.931 --> 58:30.057
Bother...

58:33.412 --> 58:34.879
That's what festers.

58:40.615 --> 58:42.413
I want my life in you.

58:43.656 --> 58:44.749
It's truth.

58:44.776 --> 58:48.838
It goes beyond the blood,
fever, and the flesh.

58:51.179 --> 58:54.616
It's sacred for a highborn man
to begin your life.

59:14.067 --> 59:16.160
BRONWYN: Are you afraid of me?

59:16.147 --> 59:18.742
I cast no spells.

59:18.707 --> 59:19.833
CHRYSAGON: Better if you did.

59:21.588 --> 59:23.079
Spells can be broken.

59:25.751 --> 59:28.049
Milord, l, too, am bewitched.

01:00:16.648 --> 01:00:18.947
You. You had them hold me!

01:00:19.689 --> 01:00:20.951
ODINS: Or see you cut to pieces.

01:00:20.968 --> 01:00:23.437
MARC: Better that!
MAN: And all the rest of us?

01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:26.907
He's got my wife.

01:00:28.332 --> 01:00:30.597
He's touching her.

01:00:30.572 --> 01:00:32.699
My God, he's touching my wife!

01:00:33.134 --> 01:00:34.726
Bear it, my son.

01:00:34.733 --> 01:00:36.702
Slaves have no sons!

01:00:37.454 --> 01:00:39.389
Who took my mother
from you, coward?

01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:40.842
Who's my father?

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:44.683
Toughen up your heart.

01:00:45.458 --> 01:00:48.656
If she'd been gored by an ox,
you'd tend her.

01:00:55.221 --> 01:00:57.656
Try and forget the pain.

01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:59.350
Who knows her better than you?

01:01:02.423 --> 01:01:04.516
She's yours.

01:01:04.503 --> 01:01:06.972
Since she was little,
it was always Marc.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.856
I couldn't sleep.
It's cold out there.

01:01:53.801 --> 01:01:55.531
I feel rheumaticky.

01:01:56.522 --> 01:01:57.750
DRACO: Good Father...

01:01:58.762 --> 01:02:01.391
you have pointy ears...

01:02:02.284 --> 01:02:04.913
you have sneaky eyes...

01:02:05.964 --> 01:02:07.899
eyes that lie in your stomach.

01:02:10.286 --> 01:02:11.412
I couldn't sleep either.

01:02:12.047 --> 01:02:17.316
We are all of us, good Father,
made of the coarsest clay.

01:02:17.168 --> 01:02:23.109
You, me, my stern and glorious
brother up there in bed...

01:02:23.571 --> 01:02:26.234
though I'm sure
he isn't sleeping.

01:02:32.533 --> 01:02:35.128
I wonder whether the louse
wasn't created...

01:02:35.095 --> 01:02:37.690
on the sixth day with man.

01:02:37.655 --> 01:02:39.851
You, too, are a party to it.

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:43.656
And undeserving
of the frock I wear.

01:02:44.377 --> 01:02:48.281
But you see, Milord,
l, too, am a man...

01:02:49.659 --> 01:02:50.854
and a louse.

01:02:57.822 --> 01:02:58.754
Stand to attention!

01:02:58.782 --> 01:03:01.411
You are a guard of honor!

01:03:23.271 --> 01:03:26.070
The sun... like every other day.

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:33.200
You cried out last night.

01:03:34.474 --> 01:03:37.536
I put my fingers to your lips,
and you slept again.

01:03:38.156 --> 01:03:39.350
I dreamt of my father.

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:45.818
He died when he came home and
found his lands sold for ransom.

01:03:46.479 --> 01:03:48.447
And I took up arms for the Duke.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.031
He died in two halves.

01:03:51.921 --> 01:03:54.447
First his right side,
then his left.

01:03:56.242 --> 01:04:00.270
He had me set my hands
between his...

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:04.057
dead hand and his live one

01:04:04.085 --> 01:04:06.713
and swear to keep his faith
with the Duke.

01:04:07.926 --> 01:04:11.021
I swore to protect my brother,

01:04:10.967 --> 01:04:12.595
to recover our lands...

01:04:13.368 --> 01:04:15.097
But he was already dead.

01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:19.416
From under his right hand,
I took that sword.

01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:24.340
I've lived 20 years
with that cold wife.

01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:30.913
And off his dead finger,
I took this ring.

01:04:41.506 --> 01:04:42.735
What are you doing?

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:45.111
Milord, it's dawn.

01:04:50.981 --> 01:04:52.107
CHRYSAGON: They won't take you.

01:04:53.382 --> 01:04:55.817
Not the Duke,
nor the devil, nor all...

01:04:55.782 --> 01:04:58.343
It could never, never be.

01:04:59.079 --> 01:05:00.274
[Thud]

01:05:10.827 --> 01:05:12.125
[Thud]

01:05:24.432 --> 01:05:28.335
It's daylight in the swamps...
or did you notice?

01:05:30.034 --> 01:05:32.128
You look as though
your fever's gone.

01:05:36.597 --> 01:05:40.797
The elder... what's his name,
Odins... waits for her below.

01:05:46.039 --> 01:05:47.337
Don't you hear me, Chrysagon?

01:05:49.561 --> 01:05:50.858
It's over now.

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.515
I'll talk to him.

01:05:54.522 --> 01:05:56.650
That old clown? Let him howl.

01:05:57.563 --> 01:05:59.998
But there was an understanding
with the Duke.

01:05:59.964 --> 01:06:01.091
You've forgotten?

01:06:02.685 --> 01:06:04.654
"Keep their good will," he said.

01:06:07.327 --> 01:06:08.624
I'll not give her up.

01:06:11.168 --> 01:06:12.260
I can't.

01:06:12.288 --> 01:06:16.226
First, you run stallion-mad and
trample our lives to pieces...

01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:17.597
My life is my own.

01:06:20.451 --> 01:06:21.976
Dear lord and brother,

01:06:23.172 --> 01:06:26.438
you are the Duke's
most favorite jewel, his cosset.

01:06:26.373 --> 01:06:28.808
Through you, comes everything.

01:06:28.774 --> 01:06:32.905
All we have,
and we must have something!

01:06:33.896 --> 01:06:37.492
You've had the grain
out of my horse's mouth,

01:06:37.417 --> 01:06:39.682
new armor that should have
clothed my men.

01:06:39.658 --> 01:06:42.253
Their blood paid
for your fineries!

01:06:42.219 --> 01:06:43.345
CHRYSAGON: My blood, too.

01:06:43.371 --> 01:06:45.772
Bounty from the wars,
each favor of the Duke,

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:49.336
I gave to you, all to you,
wantoning at court,

01:06:49.261 --> 01:06:54.530
while I sweated inside that
damn, dirty armor 20 years!

01:06:54.383 --> 01:06:56.648
I've had nothing.
Nothing! Nothing!

01:06:56.624 --> 01:06:58.091
You are our lord!

01:07:00.945 --> 01:07:03.540
You cannot be
a slave of a slave!

01:07:03.506 --> 01:07:05.634
It sets the whole world turvy!

01:07:06.867 --> 01:07:08.164
[Kicks door]

01:07:11.189 --> 01:07:15.126
And look at her,
this flower face,

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:16.657
the sister of pigs!

01:07:17.751 --> 01:07:19.378
This blazing whore.

01:07:20.792 --> 01:07:24.229
That naked strumpet
wears our father's ring!

01:07:24.153 --> 01:07:27.555
Then honor it... and her!

01:07:35.197 --> 01:07:36.664
She is mine.

01:07:42.079 --> 01:07:43.547
You are bewitched.

01:07:46.401 --> 01:07:50.099
You've had her... now keep her.

01:07:50.722 --> 01:07:53.191
And may your soul
be damned for it.

01:08:07.368 --> 01:08:08.494
ODINS: Where is she?

01:08:09.769 --> 01:08:13.365
He speaks of love, the sort of
thing that songs are made of.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:14.882
ODINS: Well?

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:17.325
He's not yet tired of his toy.

01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:18.884
I must see Lord Chrysagon.

01:08:24.974 --> 01:08:26.532
Don't ever touch me1

01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:42.572
BORS: What are you waiting for?

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.207
Can't you see it's over?

01:08:45.461 --> 01:08:46.758
Where is she?

01:08:50.743 --> 01:08:54.805
Father... what I said
last night... I'm sorry.

01:08:55.224 --> 01:08:56.817
He had the right.

01:08:58.745 --> 01:09:00.441
But now I have her back, l...

01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:13.296
He keeps her!

01:09:22.273 --> 01:09:24.868
No! Don't tell me of his rights!

01:09:24.834 --> 01:09:26.598
He has none. Not now.

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:27.687
What can you do?

01:09:27.715 --> 01:09:29.809
Do you want to be cut down?

01:09:29.796 --> 01:09:31.388
They are warriors, boy.

01:09:31.395 --> 01:09:32.761
You won't get by the door!

01:09:33.477 --> 01:09:35.241
MARC: I have a sickle.

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:36.671
I killed a boar in the marsh.

01:09:36.678 --> 01:09:38.613
I can kill a horse and a man.

01:09:38.599 --> 01:09:40.294
ODINS; You'll never kill him,
boy.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:43.573
Killing's his trade;
he was born to it.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.792
MARC: I'll sink my sickle in
his chest like a hook in beef.

01:09:48.682 --> 01:09:49.979
I liked him.

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:52.069
You know that I liked him?

01:09:52.844 --> 01:09:55.814
Norman or no, he seemed a man.
I'd have served him.

01:09:58.126 --> 01:09:59.388
I raged last night.

01:09:59.406 --> 01:10:02.001
I thought, "Well, he's higher
than I am, better."

01:10:01.967 --> 01:10:03.093
And she...

01:10:04.208 --> 01:10:07.235
I'll strangle him
in his own stinking guts.

01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:09.162
But not alone.

01:10:09.169 --> 01:10:10.432
Hark to what I told you.

01:10:10.449 --> 01:10:12.212
Go over the water
to the Frisians.

01:10:12.210 --> 01:10:14.805
Take the boat in the fen,
bring them back with you.

01:10:14.771 --> 01:10:16.706
Why should they help us?

01:10:16.692 --> 01:10:19.787
Because this half-sized Norman
says they will?

01:10:19.733 --> 01:10:21.325
No, you ditch dog...

01:10:21.333 --> 01:10:24.429
for the boy I told you of,
the boy I took.

01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:26.138
He's a prince of those people.

01:10:26.135 --> 01:10:28.400
If they know he's in that tower,

01:10:28.376 --> 01:10:31.471
they'll take it down stone
by stone to have him back.

01:10:31.417 --> 01:10:33.009
A Frisian prince?

01:10:33.017 --> 01:10:34.417
He told you that?

01:10:35.258 --> 01:10:36.419
These did.

01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:45.975
Take that to them.

01:10:46.941 --> 01:10:49.934
I'll keep this to be a lord in.

01:10:50.944 --> 01:10:52.536
ODINS: Go then, my son.

01:10:52.544 --> 01:10:54.308
It can't be mended
without blood.

01:10:55.105 --> 01:10:56.573
I'll be back within the week.

01:10:59.266 --> 01:11:00.700
She'll escape him somehow,

01:11:00.707 --> 01:11:02.505
no matter
how close he keeps her.

01:11:12.071 --> 01:11:13.538
Old woman, take it in.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:07.957
[Thunder]

01:12:15.291 --> 01:12:17.886
Where are the men from
the village to work in the moat?

01:12:17.853 --> 01:12:19.788
None came today, Lord.

01:12:19.774 --> 01:12:21.241
Yesterday, only two.

01:12:21.695 --> 01:12:24.129
The village elder,
I haven't seen him...

01:12:39.141 --> 01:12:41.109
[Thunder]

01:13:25.716 --> 01:13:27.184

01:13:30.678 --> 01:13:32.146
[Falcon cries]

01:14:26.056 --> 01:14:27.319
CHRYSAGON: It's cold.

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:28.862
My love, you're shivering.

01:14:33.579 --> 01:14:35.046
Do you know the stars?

01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:38.449
CHRYSAGON: My father taught me
to find my way by them.

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:41.936
I know only this village.

01:14:41.903 --> 01:14:43.200
An now, only this tower.

01:14:46.383 --> 01:14:47.783
CHRYSAGON:
Do you want to go back?

01:14:50.706 --> 01:14:52.173
I can't leave you.

01:14:52.945 --> 01:14:54.413
CHRYSAGON: I know.

01:14:56.787 --> 01:15:02.728
Worlds wider than this tower,
I do know that road.

01:15:02.549 --> 01:15:08.956
There's a place, a far place
where I can carry you.

01:15:10.071 --> 01:15:11.198
When?

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:14.108
Please? When?

01:15:14.073 --> 01:15:15.540
CHRYSAGON: When all's done here.

01:15:16.793 --> 01:15:20.891
I must hold this place
awhile yet... for the Duke.

01:15:27.998 --> 01:15:29.967
[Dogs barking]

01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:42.895
The Frisians. They're back.

01:16:02.089 --> 01:16:04.058
[Ring]

01:16:14.413 --> 01:16:15.847

[Horses whinny]

01:16:29.778 --> 01:16:31.872
CHRYSAGON:
Tybald, get water to the roof.

01:16:31.859 --> 01:16:34.021
Break some stones
from the parapet.

01:17:07.391 --> 01:17:08.689
BORS: Away!

01:17:48.685 --> 01:17:49.880

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:52.693
War lord!

01:17:53.647 --> 01:17:57.948
The boy... or we cut
your Norman throats!

01:18:06.612 --> 01:18:08.774
Has the whole village
joined them?

01:18:09.493 --> 01:18:13.090
Nearly all, I fear, Milord,
God save their souls.

01:18:13.014 --> 01:18:17.315
Isn't that your falconer,
the little man?

01:18:21.017 --> 01:18:22.451
Volc, too.

01:18:22.457 --> 01:18:27.054
DRACO: So, Sir Flea
has deserted us.

01:18:26.938 --> 01:18:30.876
Oh, well.
Small loss, eh, Brother?

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.213
MAN: War lord!

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:34.689
The boy! My son!

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.353
DRACO: Your son, is he?

01:18:54.308 --> 01:18:57.278
You gave my father back
for a bucketful of gold pieces.

01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:01.280
The same for your son, then,
or take him without his head!

01:20:02.651 --> 01:20:06.281
Can you put enough edge on that
to cut your way out of this?

01:20:08.893 --> 01:20:12.991
Oh, I know we're all safe
in your strong hand...

01:20:12.895 --> 01:20:16.525
and do but trust in you
and all will yet be well, huh?

01:20:26.339 --> 01:20:30.437
Lie here with your wench, then,
Sir Chrysagon de la Cruex...

01:20:30.341 --> 01:20:33.834
until those pirates pull
the Duke's tower into the swamp.

01:20:34.662 --> 01:20:38.258
Draco, what would you do
if you break the Duke's faith...

01:20:38.183 --> 01:20:40.118
I break his faith?

01:20:40.104 --> 01:20:41.867
You're the lord of this place.

01:20:41.864 --> 01:20:43.628
"Hold it well," he told you.

01:20:43.625 --> 01:20:45.594
And where are the dogs
you hold it for?

01:20:46.186 --> 01:20:48.985
Waiting outside your door
with pitchforks.

01:20:50.507 --> 01:20:51.941
- But you...
- What, Brother?

01:20:54.029 --> 01:20:56.497
DRACO: Will you chop me
with this great sword?

01:20:59.631 --> 01:21:02.795
Well, it might be.

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:05.852
You're a tall, strong man.

01:21:06.993 --> 01:21:08.291
Or I might chop you.

01:21:10.995 --> 01:21:13.089
Neither way
would make you right.

01:21:30.841 --> 01:21:32.241
Now! Open it!

01:21:43.647 --> 01:21:47.379
My brother's ridden for help...
to the Duke.

01:22:16.617 --> 01:22:18.050
It's ready!

01:22:18.057 --> 01:22:19.525
Bow the tower doors.

01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:53.756
Now!

01:23:14.397 --> 01:23:15.830
We need a grappling hook.

01:23:15.837 --> 01:23:16.963
BORS: There is none.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.887
Milord!

01:23:31.042 --> 01:23:32.305
BORS: The boat!

01:23:32.323 --> 01:23:34.086
It could have an anchor.

01:23:34.724 --> 01:23:35.850
Get me a rope!

01:23:38.725 --> 01:23:40.192
Take a turn around that post.

01:23:45.447 --> 01:23:47.211
- Not you, Bors.
- Why not?

01:23:47.208 --> 01:23:50.542
I would as soon die
a wet death as a dry one.

PRIEST: Will help
soon come from Ghent?

01:27:06.316 --> 01:27:07.613
Help?

01:27:10.957 --> 01:27:13.950
Aye, if the Duke wills
it'll come, soon or late.

01:27:14.959 --> 01:27:17.622
But... but will it be in time?

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:21.085
Ha! Look, ye priest...

01:27:21.041 --> 01:27:26.310
if they rise early, move fast,
and find us alive,

01:27:26.163 --> 01:27:27.892
then it will be in time.

01:27:28.723 --> 01:27:29.850
Hmm!

01:28:04.416 --> 01:28:05.542
CHRYSAGON: Up now.

01:28:10.498 --> 01:28:11.624
Come on. Up!

01:28:14.658 --> 01:28:15.785
Get ready.

01:29:59.655 --> 01:30:00.781

01:30:19.501 --> 01:30:21.527
CHRYSAGON:
It's no use. We'll go below.

01:30:50.552 --> 01:30:52.987
Barricade the stairs!
If they overrun us down here...

CHRYSAGON: Draco!

01:40:14.264 --> 01:40:15.356
Our savior.

01:40:15.384 --> 01:40:18.844
Oh, not yet. Those wild men
are still in the woods.

01:40:20.666 --> 01:40:23.500
They won't leave
while we hold the boy.

01:40:24.508 --> 01:40:28.673
DRACO: The can't take him now...
so they must buy him.

01:40:29.949 --> 01:40:34.285
Our dearest Duke gave me more
than the men I saved you with.

01:40:34.911 --> 01:40:38.871
He promised me half the gold
our captive princeling brings.

01:40:40.993 --> 01:40:42.120
Ransom?

01:40:43.874 --> 01:40:44.967
Ho ho ho!

01:40:44.995 --> 01:40:46.690
So the world turns, Brother.

01:40:48.196 --> 01:40:51.655
As his father held ours,
so we hold him.

01:40:52.517 --> 01:40:55.112
We could sell him
a pound at a time.

01:40:57.639 --> 01:41:00.609
Mmm. Pity he's so small.

01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:07.082
Well, any ear should do
to show we are honest traders.

CHRYSAGON: Draco, let be.

01:41:10.923 --> 01:41:13.188
I've had a bellyful
of blood over this.

01:41:13.164 --> 01:41:14.564
"Let be," is it?

01:41:15.725 --> 01:41:17.591
Oh, no, Brother.

My glorious brother, no more.

01:41:23.408 --> 01:41:26.173
The Duke's had
a bellyful, too.

01:41:26.129 --> 01:41:29.156
When I told him of
the devil's brew you stirred up,

01:41:29.106 --> 01:41:31.700
he gave me your holding here.

01:41:32.627 --> 01:41:35.290
Did I say it was
a turning world?

01:41:35.252 --> 01:41:37.516
You are lord here?

01:41:37.492 --> 01:41:38.619
I am.

01:41:39.733 --> 01:41:44.502
That little insect is mine to
kill, maim, ransom as I see fit.

01:41:44.375 --> 01:41:45.967
This village is mine.

01:41:45.975 --> 01:41:47.443
As for the clods in it...

01:41:50.457 --> 01:41:52.892
they'll find what
rebellion brings.

01:41:52.858 --> 01:41:55.453
I'll give them empty sleeves
and wooden legs...

01:41:55.419 --> 01:41:58.184
- For what I did?
- Lf you like, Brother.

01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:02.407
Carry it all on your broad back,
your sins and mine.

01:42:02.301 --> 01:42:05.738
Carry them to a monkery and pray
your way to God's grace.

01:42:05.662 --> 01:42:07.597
Or go to hell.

01:42:07.583 --> 01:42:08.811
I've been there.

01:42:09.824 --> 01:42:13.454
Then go on a quest for the Holy
Grail, and take that with you.

01:42:14.785 --> 01:42:16.754
But first, my father's ring.

01:42:19.907 --> 01:42:22.843
- The ring, I say!
- Draco!

01:42:22.788 --> 01:42:24.620
Shall I take her finger with it?

01:42:35.432 --> 01:42:37.264
I can't fight you, Draco.

01:42:37.833 --> 01:42:39.665
Then I'll fight you.

01:42:48.877 --> 01:42:50.003
Ahh!

01:42:56.238 --> 01:42:57.365
Why?

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.936
While I ate the bread
you earned in the wars...

01:43:00.881 --> 01:43:03.476
and rode the horse
you gave me...

01:43:03.442 --> 01:43:06.537
and lived in the shadow of
your sickening righteousness...

01:43:06.483 --> 01:43:08.543
because the Duke smiled
on you...

01:43:08.532 --> 01:43:10.329
Well, he's not smiling now.

01:43:10.324 --> 01:43:12.589
Now I hold this place!

01:43:12.564 --> 01:43:14.863
And you'll all swear
your fealty to me.

01:43:17.207 --> 01:43:18.902
Not while Milord lives.

01:43:19.511 --> 01:43:21.537
Then your lord shall die.

01:43:32.412 --> 01:43:34.039
This thing must be settled.

01:43:36.572 --> 01:43:37.699

01:43:40.575 --> 01:43:42.099
I swear to you, Draco.

01:43:51.298 --> 01:43:52.732

then butchery it shall be.

I'll give you all I can...

01:49:24.852 --> 01:49:27.822
rank, riches, land.

01:49:29.333 --> 01:49:30.766
Cross the water with us.

01:49:36.055 --> 01:49:37.181
No.

01:49:47.419 --> 01:49:48.716
Why "no"?

01:49:49.981 --> 01:49:51.243
Go with him.

01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:53.889
You and she get clear
of this mess.

01:49:54.622 --> 01:49:56.420
I can't give up this place.

01:49:57.663 --> 01:50:01.101
This place is no longer
yours to give up.

01:50:01.024 --> 01:50:04.461
It was Draco's for a moment.

01:50:04.386 --> 01:50:07.652
The Duke will send
another lord...

01:50:07.586 --> 01:50:09.019
to do what Draco promised,

01:50:09.027 --> 01:50:11.428
and what will you do
to save her then?

01:50:12.387 --> 01:50:14.788
Kill him... and then the next?

01:50:15.428 --> 01:50:17.192
And then the Duke himself?

01:50:21.991 --> 01:50:25.587
If you'd give mi...
milady sanctuary...

01:50:26.152 --> 01:50:27.620
FRISIAN: My roof is hers.

01:50:30.794 --> 01:50:32.261
CHRYSAGON: I'll bring her.

01:50:58.004 --> 01:51:00.132
BORS: You send her
to the Frisians.

01:51:00.885 --> 01:51:03.980
Such fierce nobility, hmm?

01:51:04.726 --> 01:51:06.024
And then what?

01:51:06.647 --> 01:51:08.012
CHRYSAGON: I go to the Duke.

01:51:09.143 --> 01:51:12.136
BORS: The Duke?
Why, to make ghosts of us?

01:51:13.208 --> 01:51:17.237
CHRYSAGON: To put what right
all I've set wrong here.

01:51:18.171 --> 01:51:20.036
BORS:
You talk like a ballad singer.

01:51:21.371 --> 01:51:25.138
Do penance?
Plead for these marsh rabbits?

01:51:25.053 --> 01:51:29.151
The Duke will have your head on
a pole and mine along with it.

01:51:29.054 --> 01:51:30.180
CHRYSAGON: Don't go, then, Bors.

01:51:30.974 --> 01:51:32.340
You get free of this.

01:51:34.015 --> 01:51:36.951
Your father sent me to ride
at your back...

01:51:36.896 --> 01:51:39.889
when you were too small
to reach the saddle.

01:51:41.379 --> 01:51:45.510
God help me, I've ridden too
many miles there to leave now.

01:52:08.587 --> 01:52:10.954
Bronwyn!

01:52:10.989 --> 01:52:12.422
[Horse whinnies]

01:52:16.590 --> 01:52:17.716
Bronwyn!

01:52:48.441 --> 01:52:49.738
Listen to me.

01:52:51.322 --> 01:52:56.056
I can't take you
to that... that far place.

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:57.901
Not for a while.

01:52:58.364 --> 01:53:02.996
I'll be with you... always,
wherever you go.

01:53:04.126 --> 01:53:07.062
So you go now to the North.

01:53:07.007 --> 01:53:09.602
No! I want to stay with you.

01:53:09.568 --> 01:53:13.699
CHRYSAGON: No, you can't.
I have to stay here.

01:53:14.658 --> 01:53:16.819
If you go, I go, too.

01:53:22.852 --> 01:53:25.287
You stand up... now...

01:53:27.174 --> 01:53:30.406
and go, and we both go.

01:54:09.108 --> 01:54:13.376
Oh, Bors. I'm tired.

01:54:15.318 --> 01:54:16.650
I hurt.

01:54:54.884 --> 01:54:56.010
Rainault!

01:55:00.646 --> 01:55:05.483
Hold this place till...
till I come back.

01:55:06.889 --> 01:55:08.357
You hold it well.
