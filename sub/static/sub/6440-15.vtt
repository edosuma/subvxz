WEBVTT

00:11.412 --> 00:12.572
Yeah.

00:12.747 --> 00:15.011
It's James Beels.

00:15.650 --> 00:17.982
Lionel Luthor. He's expecting my call.

00:19.353 --> 00:23.949
So how about this: I don't care
if he's in a meeting, get him out of it!

00:24.125 --> 00:27.185
Tell him I found something!

00:27.361 --> 00:30.819
No, I won't hold! Get him!

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:47.481 --> 00:48.846
What's your hurry, pal?

00:56.157 --> 00:57.522
Hey.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.192
Move it, already!

01:09.136 --> 01:10.433
Get out of my way!

01:28.956 --> 01:31.720
Hey, in the truck! You all right?

01:34.562 --> 01:38.521
Hey, hey!
Come on. Gotta get you out of here.

01:47.942 --> 01:52.379
Smoke. Smoke.
I'm gonna put you down.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.118
All right, come on, now.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.624
Can you hear me? Are you okay?

02:21.575 --> 02:23.668
We gotta get you out of here.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.560
Dr. Hamilton.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.729
I thought part of our arrangement
was that you don't drop in on me.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.568
A situation's come up in my lab.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.004
Don't you mean your barn?

03:30.177 --> 03:33.340
One of my experiments was stolen
by one of your employees.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.982
Why would anyone at LuthorCorp
know about your work?

03:36.150 --> 03:40.211
- He was helping me install new equipment.
- What'd he steal?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.886
A flower.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.450
You're kidding.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.824
It's called the Nicodemus.
It's been extinct for a hundred years.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.989
I hired you to study the effects
of meteors on this town.

03:53.167 --> 03:55.465
That is your focus. You're a geologist.

03:55.636 --> 03:58.571
Why are you wasting time bringing
flowers back from the dead?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.572
I irradiated the dormant seeds
with meteor fragments.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.540
I want to know the effects on people,
not plants.

04:04.712 --> 04:07.613
It's a first step. That's what science is.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.942
It's a process, a journey. You know what?

04:10.117 --> 04:13.018
Either you understand that,
or you find someone else.

04:16.322 --> 04:17.517
What's his name?

04:20.461 --> 04:24.295
James Beels. I just found out he was in
a car accident. He almost didn't make it...

04:24.465 --> 04:25.898
...but another driver pulled him out.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.801
- Don't tell me it was Clark Kent.
- Actually it was his father, Jonathan.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.648
Mom? Dad?

04:43.817 --> 04:46.012
I just heard about the...

04:49.456 --> 04:50.855
I did not need to see that.

04:51.025 --> 04:56.588
Hey, son. Just getting the old hero's
welcome, you know what I mean?

04:56.764 --> 04:58.129
What's going on with Dad?

04:58.299 --> 05:01.325
I don't know. He's been acting
strange ever since he got home.

05:01.502 --> 05:05.268
Hey, Clark, football game on TV.
You want to watch it with me?

05:06.807 --> 05:08.741
Don't you have work to do?

05:09.376 --> 05:11.640
Chores can wait.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.575
Besides- Whoa!

05:13.747 --> 05:17.274
I earned a rest. You can
pick up the slack for me, can't you?

05:18.786 --> 05:21.152
Jonathan.

05:21.956 --> 05:25.289
It's good to see this whole hero thing
didn't go to your head.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.362
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- Hi, Lex. Come in.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.191
What's up, Lex?

05:32.066 --> 05:35.695
- I'm looking for Mr. Kent.
- What do you want?

05:36.470 --> 05:39.871
I heard you pulled my employee out of a car,
I wanted to see if you were okay.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.874
No, you didn't. You wanted to see
if I was gonna sue you or not.

05:44.044 --> 05:47.138
That would put an end to all
my financial difficulty, wouldn't it?

05:47.314 --> 05:50.078
- Jonathan, that's enough.
- No, it's not enough, Martha.

05:50.251 --> 05:52.151
You see, I don't like Lex Luthor...

05:52.319 --> 05:55.777
...I don't like Lionel Luthor, and I don't
like your friendship with my son.

05:55.956 --> 05:59.483
In fact, if all of you Luthors were to
dry up and die, I wouldn't shed a tear.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.491
Dad, that's enough.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.866
I think I'll take a nap.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.507
Lex...

06:25.052 --> 06:30.684
Wow. Drinking beer, mouthing off
and counter-macking with your mom?

06:30.858 --> 06:34.055
Congratulations, Clark, your dad's
regressed back to being a teenager.

06:34.228 --> 06:37.527
He's been under a lot of stress,
but I wonder if he's beginning to crack.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.689
Who takes a three-hour nap
in the afternoon?

06:39.867 --> 06:42.631
I don't know, but I still like
the part where he dissed Lex.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.464
Why? What do you have against Lex?

06:44.638 --> 06:47.573
Let's see. He screwed my family
out of the creamed-corn factory.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.175
Well, that was 12 years ago.
And it was his father.

06:50.344 --> 06:53.404
- I've never been crazy about him.
- Why haven't you said something?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.514
I was hoping you'd see he was bad news.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.014
What's your deepest desire?

06:57.184 --> 06:59.516
If nothing was holding you back,
what would you do?

06:59.687 --> 07:02.417
Hello, Chloe, nice to see you too.
What's up?

07:02.589 --> 07:06.286
Principal Kwan thinks I need to get
in touch with the pulse of the student body.

07:06.460 --> 07:10.920
So I've decided to do a poll. Now, if you
would both please do your statistical duty.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.362
I'd go over and make out
with that girl right now.

07:13.534 --> 07:17.800
You know, every answer I've gotten so
far has been either sex- or violence-related.

07:17.971 --> 07:21.634
That's human nature, Chloe. Later.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.236
Hi.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.246
Did you know that Pete doesn't like Lex?

07:29.416 --> 07:32.010
Yeah, he's totally jealous
of your friendship with him.

07:32.186 --> 07:34.381
He feels you aren't
as close as you used to be.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.544
Hey.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.953
Hi.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.958
What about you, Lana? Got one?

07:42.162 --> 07:44.653
I would climb the windmill
out in Chandler's field.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.892
Really? That's your deepest desire.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.832
Somebody told me you could see
the Metropolis skyline from there.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.666
I haven't got the guts
to climb up and see for myself.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.673
Okay.

07:56.844 --> 08:00.177
- I can always make something up.
- No, it's good. It's good, I like it.

08:00.347 --> 08:03.783
It's unleashing the inner Lana.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.181
Okay.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.982
Okay, Clark, you're up.

08:14.595 --> 08:18.087
Clark. Remember, it's a PG-13 poll.

08:19.767 --> 08:23.362
Since Whitney's dad has been in the hospital,
there's been a no-fly zone over Lana.

08:24.505 --> 08:29.169
You know, there are other girls out there that
don't require crossing an emotional minefield.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.344
But I can't just turn off my feelings for her.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.539
You know, the choice is yours.

08:35.716 --> 08:40.779
You can either sit in your loft
and play with your telescope, or move on.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.798
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.769
What do you say you and I go up into
the hayloft and have us a little fun, huh?

08:59.940 --> 09:04.536
Not now. Somebody's gotta
do some work around here.

09:04.711 --> 09:08.442
Maybe you would like
to call Lex Luthor and apologize.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.083
Why? All I did was tell him the truth.

09:11.251 --> 09:15.187
I know I said you should let your feelings
out, but you're taking this too far.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.289
What's wrong with you?

09:17.458 --> 09:18.948
Nothing.

09:19.126 --> 09:23.119
- I feel free.
- Well, you don't look well.

09:23.297 --> 09:27.165
You're burning up. Why don't you go back
to bed. I'll make you soup when I get back.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.097
Hey.

09:29.870 --> 09:35.570
- I know a much better way to break a fever.
- Sweetheart, I have to go, really.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.985
<i>This is the Kents, leave a message.</i>

09:46.153 --> 09:48.246
<i>Jonathan, it's Jim Alexander
over at the bank.</i>

09:48.422 --> 09:52.791
<i>I'm gonna be straight with you. I'm afraid
we're going to have to turn down your loan.</i>

09:53.694 --> 09:56.060
Hello, Jim? Yeah, listen to me.

09:56.230 --> 09:58.721
I have done nothing
but give back to this community...

09:58.899 --> 10:01.561
...and all anyone has ever done
for me is screw me over.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.532
So I'm gonna come down to that bank...

10:03.704 --> 10:07.071
...and you are going to have to
turn my loan down right to my face.

10:07.241 --> 10:12.178
That way I can see whether you have a pair
or whether your wife keeps them in a drawer.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.054
Where did you learn to drive, you jerk?

10:34.234 --> 10:35.223
Slow down!

10:39.172 --> 10:40.537
Dad, what are you doing?

10:40.707 --> 10:43.767
I've done nothing but give to this town,
and they screw me over.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.105
They've pushed me too far,
and I'm pushing back.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.304
Not with a shotgun.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.939
- You gotta slow down. You're not thinking.
- I'm thinking just fine, son.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.346
Now get out of my way!

11:04.865 --> 11:06.696
Clark.

11:19.546 --> 11:20.535
Dad.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.040
Dad.

11:24.151 --> 11:27.086
His symptoms indicate
a severe anaphylactic shock.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.246
- But we can't detect any known antigens.
- What is it then?

11:30.424 --> 11:34.417
Truth is, if he'd come in just yesterday,
I'd say I'd never seen anything like it.

11:34.595 --> 11:37.689
But we admitted a car-crash victim
this morning, a James Beels?

11:37.864 --> 11:39.456
Showed identical symptoms.

11:39.633 --> 11:42.158
That's the guy Dad saved. How's he doing?

11:44.538 --> 11:45.903
Not good.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.633
He fell into a coma an hour ago.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.184
Okay, so, what are we doing out here?

12:05.359 --> 12:10.092
Mr. Kent and Mr. Beels both have the same
symptoms. This is the only place they've...

12:10.263 --> 12:14.256
...been together, so I think what happened
to Mr. Kent was caused by something here.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.527
- What are we looking for?
- Anything.

12:16.703 --> 12:20.833
Wow. The debris starts from way
over there and ends over in that ditch.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.909
That's some serious road rage.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.536
I think I found something.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.987
What you got?

13:19.299 --> 13:21.130
Sorry.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.429
That's all right. Let's get out of here.
This place is a dead end.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.418
Gesundheit.

13:46.626 --> 13:50.494
Seems you haven't been
completely honest with me, Dr. Hamilton.

13:52.099 --> 13:55.193
I told you, it's under control.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.302
Two men with an unexplained illness...

13:57.471 --> 14:01.066
...for which no one seems to know
the cure isn't my idea of under control.

14:01.241 --> 14:05.473
I did a little research of my own into
your unauthorized botany experiment.

14:06.947 --> 14:12.317
Apparently, in 1871 a strange contagion
struck the Morley settlement...

14:12.486 --> 14:14.886
...and 200 people died almost overnight.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.387
A priest who witnessed
the scene left a diary.

14:17.557 --> 14:21.254
His last entries describe how
the settlers began acting out of character.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.659
He claimed a local flower was to blame.

14:24.831 --> 14:29.165
"On God's green earth,
this flower was the thief in the temple.

14:29.336 --> 14:33.602
The silent temptress that, with a single
sneeze, brought out the basest instincts...

14:33.774 --> 14:36.242
...in men and drove them to violence."

14:36.409 --> 14:39.435
That's been relegated
to folklore in scientific circles.

14:44.017 --> 14:48.181
If you don't believe in this, you won't
mind if I lift the lid and smell the flower?

14:49.656 --> 14:50.782
Why'd you bring it back?

14:50.957 --> 14:54.222
These flowers were believed
to have toxins that, while deadly...

14:54.394 --> 14:56.453
...might have other applications.

14:56.630 --> 14:59.098
I'm not here to bankroll your pet projects.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.961
I'm only interested in the meteors.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.193
You wanted to know what they could do.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.429
Putting people in the hospital
wasn't the plan.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.470
Every discovery has their consequences.

15:07.641 --> 15:12.169
If Jonathan Kent dies, you're gonna lose
something more valuable than your tenure.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.974
Pack up a flower. I've got a team of
specialists in Metropolis to work on it.

15:16.550 --> 15:19.314
- It's my research.
- I don't give a damn about your research.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.784
I just want to find a cure.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.051
Wow.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.617
What's the occasion?

16:00.794 --> 16:06.061
Nothing. I just thought
we'd blow off class today.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.257
I...

16:07.434 --> 16:08.958
I can't.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.104
I'm barely keeping ahead,
and I gotta go to the store...

16:12.272 --> 16:14.399
...and then run by the hospital
and see my dad.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.407
You know what?
I am tired of your excuses.

16:17.577 --> 16:23.447
Ever since your dad got sick,
you haven't been any fun at all.

16:23.617 --> 16:25.744
I'm sorry, Lana, but it's kind of a big deal.

16:25.919 --> 16:29.150
Whatever. I feel like I'm locked
in this relationship out of guilt.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.519
Lana. What's wrong with you?

16:33.260 --> 16:36.388
Nothing. I'm just not
keeping it inside anymore.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.555
If that's how you feel, maybe
we need to reconsider this relationship.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.693
Okay, fine.

16:43.904 --> 16:46.065
It's over, Whitney.

16:49.743 --> 16:53.440
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Oh, Lana.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.081
Nice.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.655
Not going to class, Clark?

17:04.824 --> 17:07.792
I'm not really up... to it.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.994
What's the matter?

17:17.671 --> 17:21.038
Nothing. It's just a change.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.176
You like it?

17:28.882 --> 17:31.214
I think the operative word is "gulp."

17:34.354 --> 17:35.981
Listen.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.947
I know things are rough,
but you can't let them get you down.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.858
It's kind of hard not to.

17:45.031 --> 17:50.333
The key is to keep your mind off it.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.937
Let your friends be your friends.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.035
Let them distract you.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.876
Trust them.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.150
I do trust you, Lana.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.515
Good.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.120
Then follow me.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.066
What are we doing in here?

18:23.236 --> 18:24.828
It's quiet.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.968
It's also completely...

18:30.310 --> 18:31.572
...off-limits.

18:34.848 --> 18:37.783
Lana, I don't think I'm really up for this.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.617
You think too much, Clark.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.823
Right now I'm thinking
you don't seem like yourself.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.195
Or maybe...

19:00.840 --> 19:02.205
...I'm more me than ever.

19:06.212 --> 19:09.181
Lana, this is crazy.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.873
That's the point.

19:11.051 --> 19:16.717
If life doesn't make you crazy,
then why bother living it?

19:16.890 --> 19:18.983
I know that's how I want it.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.632
Question is:

19:35.308 --> 19:36.707
Do you want what I want?

19:54.694 --> 19:55.888
Lana!

19:56.062 --> 19:57.654
Don't you want to come in, Clark?

19:57.831 --> 20:00.299
I don't think so.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.007
I know you want me, Clark.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.745
Just stop holding back. Come on.

20:23.156 --> 20:27.559
You're not made of steel.
Or are you?

20:43.910 --> 20:45.070
Wait.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.406
Aren't you tired of waiting?

20:50.116 --> 20:52.448
Need a little help warming up?

21:06.266 --> 21:10.600
She just stripped down in front of you.
Lana Lang, in all her glory.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.261
Most of her glory. Not that Kwan saw it.

21:13.439 --> 21:17.205
Well, at least you'll have a nice picture
to daydream about in Saturday detention.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.140
She said everything
I wanted to hear...

21:19.312 --> 21:21.473
...but it didn't seem like she knew
what she was doing.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.673
What do you think made Lana go soft-core?

21:24.584 --> 21:25.846
First my dad, now Lana.

21:26.019 --> 21:29.580
Yeah, and don't forget that Beels guy.
Remember the one that your dad helped?

21:29.756 --> 21:32.418
You must have missed something
at the accident site.

21:32.592 --> 21:35.083
No, I didn't.
Because I was there and I'm fine.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.661
It just doesn't make any sense.

21:42.435 --> 21:45.461
Wait. Looks like we weren't
the only ones out there.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.162
Who's that?

21:47.340 --> 21:49.171
I think it's Dr. Hamilton.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.832
- The meteor freak?
- Yeah.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.274
What's he doing
skulking around in the woods?

21:53.446 --> 21:56.973
I don't know, but I have
a feeling it's not just a coincidence.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.311
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- I'm gonna go talk to Lana.

21:59.485 --> 22:04.013
I think whatever happened
to my father is about to happen to her.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.622
I want something better than progress.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.924
I was just at the hospital,
they're getting worse.

22:14.934 --> 22:18.426
Where have you been? Monique called
in sick, and we haven't got anyone to cover.

22:18.605 --> 22:19.833
Why is this my problem?

22:20.006 --> 22:23.407
Because Nell's in Metropolis
and you're the assistant manager.

22:23.576 --> 22:27.012
Well, I'm taking the afternoon off,
so I guess we're closing early.

22:29.983 --> 22:35.615
Listen up. We're closing early,
so coffee's on the house. Drink up.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.217
I'll call back.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.463
Lana.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.572
The Talon closes at 9.

22:56.442 --> 22:57.602
Not today.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.541
You're not impressing anyone
with the attitude, Lana.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.614
You're talking to someone who
set the bar for adolescent rebellion.

23:03.783 --> 23:09.346
That's right. I heard you were quite the bad
boy before you joined us here in Smallville.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.750
It's nothing I'm proud of.

23:10.923 --> 23:15.019
Please.
You don't really care about the Talon.

23:15.194 --> 23:18.186
You only invested because I asked you to.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.895
Now, why would you go
and do a thing like that?

23:27.707 --> 23:30.540
The Luthors are famous
for their ulterior motives.

23:30.710 --> 23:34.646
So tell me, Lex,
was it really about profit?

23:41.521 --> 23:47.153
I'm not sure what this is, but it isn't
you, Lana. Are you feeling okay?

23:49.062 --> 23:51.189
Actually...

23:52.532 --> 23:53.999
I'm a little nervous.

23:54.167 --> 23:58.263
I might need some guidance, you know...

23:58.905 --> 24:04.207
...from someone
with a little more experience.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.144
What do you say, boss?

24:12.218 --> 24:16.621
Lana, where have you been
in the last 24 hours?

24:17.056 --> 24:19.286
It's none of your business.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.154
What's your problem?

24:21.327 --> 24:22.351
This isn't you.

24:22.528 --> 24:25.429
Why, because I'm not
doing exactly as I'm told?

24:25.598 --> 24:27.998
Because I'm not sitting
in a corner hiding in a book?

24:28.167 --> 24:30.897
For once I'm not scared of life,
and no one can handle it...

24:31.070 --> 24:33.538
...because you all prefer
the insecure little girl.

24:33.706 --> 24:39.008
Well, I'm sick of her
and all her talk about her dead parents.

24:59.432 --> 25:01.627
Lana!

25:09.776 --> 25:13.075
<i>Dr. Hamilton, hello.
Chloe Sullivan, Smallville Torch.</i>

25:13.246 --> 25:15.043
We spoke on the Internet
about the meteors?

25:15.214 --> 25:16.203
Chloe.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.645
Can you tell me what you were
doing in the woods last night?

25:20.720 --> 25:22.654
What I do there most nights.

25:22.822 --> 25:26.258
Search for meteor samples.
I find it easier to spot them with flashlights.

25:26.426 --> 25:28.417
So you didn't see me and my friend.

25:28.594 --> 25:32.223
I heard voices, I saw flashlights,
I know that kids like to party...

25:32.398 --> 25:34.559
...and as you know, I don't like company.

25:34.734 --> 25:37.897
- You weren't looking at the accident scene?
- What accident?

25:41.908 --> 25:46.140
I must be mistaken.
Sorry to have bothered you.

25:46.312 --> 25:49.543
And what were you doing
in the woods last night?

25:49.715 --> 25:52.206
Partying with my friends.

26:19.445 --> 26:22.937
Lana, what's going on?
Does Lex know you have his car?

26:24.417 --> 26:26.749
He should by now.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.251
Something happened to you,
I just don't know what.

26:30.423 --> 26:35.690
It's called self-confidence. For the first time,
I'm not repressing my feelings. I'm free.

26:35.862 --> 26:36.886
No, you're not.

26:37.830 --> 26:41.197
You should talk. You had me in the pool,
and you didn't take your chance.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.302
I see the way you look at me.
Why don't you tell me how you feel?

26:44.470 --> 26:46.802
Lana, you're sick.
I need to get you to a hospital.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.908
Don't avoid the question, Clark.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.476
Are you in love with me?

26:53.746 --> 26:54.735
Lana...

26:54.914 --> 26:58.179
Such a coward.
Can't even answer a simple question.

26:58.351 --> 27:01.320
You want me? Come and get me.

27:01.487 --> 27:02.886
Lana, stop!

27:03.055 --> 27:06.991
What's the matter, Clark? Afraid of heights?

27:08.928 --> 27:10.862
What are you doing? Come down!

27:16.636 --> 27:17.625
Lana!

27:28.481 --> 27:29.539
Lana!

27:33.185 --> 27:34.174
Clark.

27:43.696 --> 27:44.856
Coming through.

27:48.501 --> 27:49.525
What happened?

27:50.336 --> 27:52.395
She's got the
same symptoms as Dad and Beels.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.407
How's Dad?

27:56.576 --> 28:01.946
He slipped into a coma.
The doctors don't know how long he'll last.

28:11.691 --> 28:16.958
I've got doctors flying in from Metropolis.
I'm going to do everything I can for Mr. Kent.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.435
Clark, I'm sorry.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.982
It's not your fault, Lex.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.598
<i>- Dr. Hamilton had a copy of this in his barn.
- Nicodemus Diary.</i>

28:58.771 --> 29:01.399
It's a first-hand account
of Smallville's first mystery.

29:01.574 --> 29:05.066
In 1871, the whole settlement went
postal before they even had a post office.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.804
Nice to know Smallville was
whacked before the meteors.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.881
Yeah. In the diary, they talk about a flower.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.779
The settlers called it Nicodemus.

29:12.952 --> 29:19.221
They said it liberated repressed feelings,
sent them into rages, then fever and finally-

29:20.292 --> 29:22.089
Well...

29:24.797 --> 29:26.662
Well, where can we find this flower?

29:26.832 --> 29:28.197
You see, that's the glitch.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.927
After the massacre,
the cavalry torched the settlement.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.503
They didn't want
whatever caused it to spread.

29:33.673 --> 29:35.470
The flower's been extinct for 100 years.

29:35.641 --> 29:37.768
How is Hamilton involved in this?
He's a geologist.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.001
With a meteor fixation.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.908
We tracked down this paper
he wrote six years ago.

29:42.081 --> 29:45.539
- Metropolis University Press.
- I think this is the last straw.

29:45.718 --> 29:50.781
In it, he postulates that meteor rocks
can be used to irradiate dormant plant cells.

29:50.956 --> 29:53.390
So you think Hamilton
brought back the Nicodemus.

29:53.559 --> 29:56.460
- And now he's trying to cover it up.
- Let's go talk to him.

29:56.629 --> 30:01.692
<i>Wait, there's more. Dr. Hamilton didn't
check out The Nicodemus Diary. Lex did.</i>

30:02.702 --> 30:03.828
You think he's involved?

30:04.003 --> 30:05.971
I told you all along he was bad news.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.799
Pete, we don't know anything yet.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.376
Good.

30:17.483 --> 30:21.544
I'll call back. I just got off the phone with
the doctors. They've isolated the problem.

30:22.955 --> 30:26.322
Does it have to do with
the Nicodemus flower?

30:26.492 --> 30:28.687
I know you checked
the diary out of the library.

30:29.762 --> 30:31.957
- Yes, I did, Clark.
- Why?

30:32.131 --> 30:35.828
Because my property was built on
the site of the original settlement.

30:36.001 --> 30:39.061
I always thought it was an interesting story.
When I heard about your dad...

30:39.238 --> 30:42.503
- ... I tracked it down to see if it could help.
- Why didn't you tell me?

30:43.275 --> 30:46.711
Clark, it's a crackpot story.
I was grasping at straws.

30:46.879 --> 30:49.245
- Do you know Dr. Steven Hamilton?
- Who's that?

30:49.415 --> 30:51.542
Don't lie to me!

30:52.318 --> 30:54.047
Clark, calm down.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.013
I know you're worried
about your dad and Lana...

30:57.189 --> 31:00.124
...but I checked the book
out of the library, that's it.

31:02.194 --> 31:06.631
I'm not responsible for what happened, and
I'm doing everything in my power to fix it.

31:06.799 --> 31:08.289
That's the truth, Clark.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.368
Okay, keep your flashlight low.

31:17.877 --> 31:21.074
You're an expert on breaking
and entering now?

31:26.318 --> 31:28.309
Be careful!

31:48.440 --> 31:49.805
Pete, what happened?

31:49.975 --> 31:53.638
Pete? You okay?

32:00.152 --> 32:01.949
Pete?

32:05.491 --> 32:08.483
- You looking for me?
- Oh, no.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.822
Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?

32:10.996 --> 32:16.263
Okay, Pete, you've been infected.
We've gotta get you to the hospital.

32:16.435 --> 32:21.202
That's right.
Ignore Pete, he's just the funny guy.

32:21.807 --> 32:24.867
You don't sweat his feelings,
because you've got eyes for Clark.

32:25.044 --> 32:28.343
Calm down, Pete.
I'm going to call Clark.

32:30.816 --> 32:33.979
He's probably hanging out with
his new best friend, Lex Luthor.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.629
Give me your keys.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.324
Why, where are you going?

32:54.173 --> 32:56.403
I'm serious, Chloe.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.338
Give me the damn keys!

33:20.699 --> 33:21.688
How is he?

33:23.002 --> 33:24.492
Not good.

33:26.071 --> 33:29.563
Clark, Mr. Beels died half an hour ago.

33:40.252 --> 33:43.779
With all my abilities,
there's nothing I can do.

33:46.292 --> 33:47.384
What will we do if Dad-?

33:47.559 --> 33:49.322
I don't know.

33:55.167 --> 33:59.331
Did I ever tell you about
the first time I ever saw him?

34:01.907 --> 34:03.431
No.

34:04.910 --> 34:09.847
He came to Metropolis U to take a finance
course, and he was sitting by a fountain...

34:10.014 --> 34:12.916
...all denim and flannel, eating an apple.

34:13.085 --> 34:15.280
And I asked to borrow his notes.

34:15.454 --> 34:20.414
He didn't know that I was
the note-taker for the class. He still doesn't.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.324
You're sly, Mom.

34:25.898 --> 34:28.992
He was so cute.

34:30.402 --> 34:35.362
So I asked him for his notes,
and he just handed over his notebook...

34:35.541 --> 34:37.873
...without even asking my name, and I said:

34:38.043 --> 34:41.603
"How can you be sure I'll bring it back?"
And he said:

34:41.780 --> 34:45.476
"I prefer to believe in people."

34:46.985 --> 34:48.715
It sounds like Dad.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.856
And I remember looking at him,
completely embarrassed...

34:52.024 --> 34:56.222
...because I was thinking the dumbest thing.
I was thinking:

34:56.395 --> 34:58.363
"God, I hope he marries me."

34:59.331 --> 35:01.128
I still think that.

35:01.300 --> 35:06.363
Every day there's a part of me that says,
"God, I hope he marries me."

35:17.016 --> 35:21.112
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kent.
Can I talk to you for a second, Clark?

35:21.787 --> 35:23.550
Go.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.831
I'm so sorry.

35:36.001 --> 35:39.232
Dr. Hamilton was lying.
I found the Nicodemus flower in the barn.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.737
One got Pete,
and he took a quick turn to scary.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.636
- Where'd he go?
- He grabbed a gun...

35:43.809 --> 35:45.902
...and he said he was going after Lex.

35:52.217 --> 35:55.983
This flower has existed for-
For hundreds of years.

35:56.155 --> 35:59.647
Now, the Native Americans must have
developed some sort of herbal antidote...

35:59.825 --> 36:01.656
...and these are the instructions.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.091
- Where'd you find it?
- Collecting dust in a museum.

36:04.263 --> 36:08.427
- It's a one of a kind, so they want it back.
- I'll get it to my team in Metropolis.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.862
Nobody's going anywhere.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.032
Pete.

36:14.973 --> 36:16.634
What are you doing here?

36:18.510 --> 36:23.038
I knew you were behind this. You pretended
to be Clark's friend, but you're not.

36:24.316 --> 36:28.548
And now his dad's gonna die.
Because of you.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.052
- What's this about?
- Do not pretend you don't know.

36:31.223 --> 36:32.451
I went to your barn!

36:32.624 --> 36:34.592
He's infected.

36:34.760 --> 36:38.218
Pete, we have the cure.
We're going to make everyone better.

36:38.397 --> 36:42.390
You're nothing but a liar. Clark can't see it,
but I can. And now you're gonna pay.

36:42.568 --> 36:43.557
No!

36:48.474 --> 36:54.470
Pete, if that book is destroyed,
you and Lana and Mr. Kent will all die.

36:54.646 --> 36:55.635
You're lying.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.111
Pete, I want to help you.

36:57.282 --> 37:00.581
You don't want to help anybody but yourself!

37:00.752 --> 37:03.653
You come to town and suddenly
you're Clark's new best friend!

37:05.724 --> 37:08.693
- I thought he was a good judge of character.
- Lex, the book?

37:11.597 --> 37:14.464
Pete, I'm going to reach in there
and grab that book.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.100
If you want to shoot me...

37:19.104 --> 37:20.503
...go ahead.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.765
No problem.

37:27.112 --> 37:28.807
Get out.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.279
Say goodbye, Lex.

37:37.456 --> 37:40.050
Pete! Don't do it.

37:40.225 --> 37:41.920
We used to be best friends.

37:42.094 --> 37:46.121
His dad screwed over my dad, and now
he's trying to screw up things between us.

37:46.298 --> 37:48.664
The world's a better place without him.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.301
Pete, put the gun down.

37:50.469 --> 37:54.405
He's behind all this. I saw Hamilton here.

37:54.973 --> 37:57.840
They're working on this together!

37:58.010 --> 38:01.741
- Is that true?
- Clark. He's delusional.

38:01.914 --> 38:06.351
I don't believe you. You're right,
Pete, he's been lying to everyone.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.179
I know who my true friends are.

38:08.353 --> 38:09.684
I knew you'd see the light.

38:14.293 --> 38:16.386
Clark, what are you doing?

38:16.562 --> 38:18.496
Can't talk your way out of this one, Lex.

38:18.664 --> 38:21.792
I see you how you really are.
The friendship is over.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.095
Nice one.

38:28.273 --> 38:30.503
I'll finish him.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.675
How'd you do that?

38:34.846 --> 38:37.713
Don't worry, Pete,
we'll get you to the hospital.

38:45.290 --> 38:46.780
Clark, what the hell?

38:46.959 --> 38:49.189
I'm sorry, Lex.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.626
So that was an act?

38:53.799 --> 38:56.597
I didn't know what else to do.
He was gonna shoot you.

38:57.436 --> 39:00.599
You had me for a moment.
I thought you were serious.

39:00.772 --> 39:03.536
What do they feed you on that farm?

39:05.077 --> 39:06.476
Was Hamilton really here?

39:07.579 --> 39:10.047
What do you think, Clark?

39:26.531 --> 39:28.226
Morning, sleepyhead.

39:30.269 --> 39:31.964
Dad, you're okay.

39:32.137 --> 39:38.098
Yeah. Clark.
Clark, what am I doing here?

39:38.277 --> 39:41.474
Jonathan! Oh, sweetheart!

39:42.147 --> 39:43.842
- Martha.
- Oh, sweetheart!

39:44.016 --> 39:47.918
The doctors in Metropolis found a cure last
night. It was an old Native American remedy.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.520
- How are Pete and Lana?
- They're already up.

39:52.291 --> 39:54.816
- Dad, do you remember anything?
- No.

39:54.993 --> 39:59.259
- The doctors think it's because of the fever.
- Trust me, it's better that way.

39:59.431 --> 40:02.730
- Come on, what are you talking about?
- Oh, sweetheart.

40:06.471 --> 40:09.099
Dr. Hamilton, hello?

40:33.799 --> 40:35.460
- What'd you do with my lab?
- Destroyed it.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.795
- How dare you!
- You're lucky you found a cure...

40:37.969 --> 40:40.096
...and nobody infected
can remember anything.

40:40.272 --> 40:41.534
But people are talking.

40:41.707 --> 40:45.199
Beels worked for my father,
and then there's Chloe Sullivan.

40:45.377 --> 40:47.538
I'm sensing this relationship is over.

40:47.713 --> 40:53.345
No, doctor, I think you're very talented.
You just need closer supervision.

40:54.086 --> 40:57.522
I recently acquired a small
research facility outside Metropolis.

40:57.689 --> 41:01.420
Cadmus Labs? I'm gonna hide you out there.

41:02.761 --> 41:06.253
Remember, Lex,
you're the one opening Pandora's box.

41:06.431 --> 41:09.332
I'm just the key, Dr. Hamilton.

41:22.147 --> 41:25.344
Okay, open your eyes, Lana.

41:30.021 --> 41:31.716
There's Metropolis.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.682
It's beautiful.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.823
I can't believe we're up here.

41:39.364 --> 41:43.095
It's actually getting down which
is gonna be the interesting part.

41:46.104 --> 41:48.129
It's good to have you back, Lana.

41:49.508 --> 41:55.845
I spent the entire day apologizing to
the Talon staff and to Lex and to Whitney.

41:56.014 --> 41:59.381
I just wish I could remember what happened.

41:59.551 --> 42:01.951
It sounds like
I got a little out of control there.

42:02.120 --> 42:07.820
You spoke your mind, and you did what
you wanted. Kind of an alpha Lana.

42:10.862 --> 42:14.093
I couldn't believe what I was wearing.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.392
I kind of liked it.

42:22.340 --> 42:27.607
I didn't say or do anything embarrassing
to you that I should know about...

42:27.779 --> 42:29.610
...did I?

42:33.785 --> 42:35.412
No.

42:37.756 --> 42:41.453
Good. Good.

42:42.761 --> 42:45.093
So how does it feel
to be on top of the world?

42:47.399 --> 42:49.799
Or at least Smallville?

42:55.340 --> 42:58.002
I feel free.

42:59.305 --> 43:05.164
