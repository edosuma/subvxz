21:13.000 --> 21:15.750
OH, DEAR. ED!

21:17.000 --> 21:19.042
IT IS LOST, GUYS.

21:19.125 --> 21:21.458

21:24.625 --> 21:27.000
GIVE ME A BREAK,

21:36.042 --> 21:38.000
I'M SOAKED
TO THE MARROW.

21:38.083 --> 21:40.458
OUR MOTHERS MUST BE
WORRIED SICK.

21:40.542 --> 21:42.542
BESIDES,
THE JAWBREAKER

21:42.625 --> 21:45.000
WOULD SURELY HAVE
DISSOLVED BY NOW.

21:45.083 --> 21:46.333
I ALMOST HAD IT!

21:46.417 --> 21:49.792
BUT YOU HAD TO BE
A MR. GOODY-GOODY-TWO-SHOES.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.292
"LET'S SHARE IT."

21:51.375 --> 21:53.083

22:00.292 --> 22:03.833
TELL ME, ED,
WHAT FLAVOR IS IT?

22:03.917 --> 22:05.583
DOES IT TASTE
LIKE A FIST?

22:05.667 --> 22:10.208
UH, NO. IT SORT OF
TASTES LIKE CHICKEN.

22:10.292 --> 22:11.792
TRY SOME.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.000
AAH!
