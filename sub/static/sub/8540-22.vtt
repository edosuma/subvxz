YOU KNOW, THEY USED US TO
SHUT DOWN THEIR OWN COMPETITION,

10:26.538 --> 10:28.802
BUILDING THEMSELVES A MONOPOLY.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.760
HERE.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.937
THAT THE SPEECH?MY COPY.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.157
AND WHY DIDN'T YOU
NOTIFY THE AUTHORITIES

10:36.157 --> 10:39.203
ONCE YOU FIGURED OUT
WHAT WAS GOING ON?'CAUSE HECTOR SAID

10:39.203 --> 10:42.076
THAT HE WANTED TO DENOUNCE LYNCH
HIMSELF, IN PUBLIC.

10:42.076 --> 10:45.732
I SAID IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS,
BUT HE JUST WOULDN'T LISTEN.

10:45.732 --> 10:49.474
DID BRAVA EVER MENTION
ANYBODY NAMED CARMEN TO YOU?

10:49.474 --> 10:51.476
NO. NO, NOT TO ME.

10:51.476 --> 10:52.956
WHY?

10:52.956 --> 10:55.219
SO BIGELOW IS SAYING
THAT THE PEOPLE

10:55.219 --> 10:57.874
FIGHTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING
WERE TRAFFICKERS.APPARENTLY.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.485
ALL RIGHT. YOU AND CHO
GO TALK TO THIS LYNCH.

11:00.485 --> 11:03.184
SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY
FOR HIMSELF.OKAY, YOU GOT IT.

11:03.184 --> 11:06.578
[indistinct conversations]

11:06.578 --> 11:08.493
[man] ARE YOU GUYS JOKING?

11:08.493 --> 11:11.018
BECAUSE YOUR HUMOR'S
IN BAD TASTE.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.976
HECTOR WAS A CLOSE COLLEAGUE
AND A GOOD FRIEND.

11:12.976 --> 11:15.544
WHO WAS PLANNING TO GIVE
A SPEECH THAT WOULD IDENTIFY

11:15.544 --> 11:18.634
YOUR COALITION AS A FRONT FOR
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS, MR. LYNCH.HE NAMED YOU SPECIFICALLY.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.418
[laughs] LOOK,

11:20.418 --> 11:23.073
SOMEONE IS LEADING YOU DOWN
THE GARDEN PATH, GENTLEMEN.

11:23.073 --> 11:25.075
OKAY, THERE'S NO BASIS
OF TRUTH IN THIS.

11:25.075 --> 11:27.991
SURELY YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S
IN THE TRAFFICKERS' INTEREST

11:27.991 --> 11:30.733
TO SPLIT US UP,
GET US SUSPECTING EACH OTHER.

11:30.733 --> 11:34.171
LOOKS LIKE BRAVA
WENT PAST SUSPECTING YOU.OH, PLEASE. HECTOR SAW
CONSPIRACIES EVERYWHERE.

11:34.171 --> 11:37.871
YOU KNOW, HE LIKED
BEING IN THE SPOTLIGHT.WE READ THE SPEECH.

11:37.871 --> 11:42.136
IT MAKES
A PRETTY CONVINCING CASE.OKAY, LOOK. WE'RE GONNA
CLEAR THIS UP RIGHT NOW.

11:42.136 --> 11:44.921
I WILL HAVE MY LAWYERS GIVE YOU
ACCESS TO ALL OUR RECORDS,

11:44.921 --> 11:47.358
AND THEN YOU WILL SEE

11:47.358 --> 11:50.100
THAT THE COALITION
HAS NOTHING TO HIDE.DOES THE NAME "CARMEN"
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

11:50.100 --> 11:53.060
NO.CAN YOU THINK OF ANYBODY
WHO'D WANT TO KILL BRAVA?

11:53.060 --> 11:55.497
OH, YEAH, MAYBE
ONLY A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.499
I JU--UH, WAIT A SECOND.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.414
ONE THING.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.459
SECOND NIGHT
OF THE CONVENTION,

12:01.459 --> 12:05.333
I SAW HECTOR HAVING AN ARGUMENT
WITH A MAN NAMED TARIQ SHARIF

12:05.333 --> 12:07.161
OUTSIDE THE HOTEL BAR,

12:07.161 --> 12:10.642
AND FOR MY MONEY,
THE ARGUMENT WAS ABOUT A WOMAN.

12:10.642 --> 12:13.602
HOW COULD YOU TELL?BECAUSE I KNOW THESE GUYS,
AND THEY DEFINITELY WEREN'T

12:13.602 --> 12:16.910
HAVING A DISCUSSION
ABOUT IMMIGRATION POLICY.

12:16.910 --> 12:21.218
HOW'S IT COMING WITH LYNCH?SAYS A MAN CALLED TARIQ SHARIF
WAS FIGHTING WITH BRAVA.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.699
I'M CHECKING FOR AN I.D.
ON SHARIF RIGHT NOW.I TOOK A LOOK AT THE RECORDS

12:23.699 --> 12:26.702
THAT LYNCH'S LAWYER
E-MAILED OVER. FIRST GLANCE,

12:26.702 --> 12:29.009
COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING THAT
SUPPORTS BRAVA'S ACCUSATIONS.I CHECKED
LYNCH'S PHONE RECORDS.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.402
HE MADE A SINGLE CALL
RIGHT AFTER WE LEFT

12:31.402 --> 12:34.057
THE INTERVIEW TO AN ANONYMOUS
DISPOSABLE CELL.DOES IT SAY
WHERE IT ORIGINATED?

12:34.057 --> 12:38.018
HERE'S THE WEIRD THING...THE CALL ENDS AT A CELL TOWER
OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

12:38.018 --> 12:41.064
THAT IS WEIRD.RIGHT? SO WE FIGURED
MAYBE WE'D GO CHECK IT OUT.

12:41.064 --> 12:44.764
ALL RIGHT.HERE WE GO. I GOT HIM.
HERE'S TARIQ SHARIF.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.899

12:49.899 --> 12:51.771
I'LL SEE
IF ANYBODY'S SEEN SHARIF.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.036
EXCUSE ME.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.560
[Lisbon]
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

12:58.560 --> 13:01.824
HE'S ABOUT 6'2",

13:24.194 --> 13:25.456
YES?

13:25.456 --> 13:27.284
WE'RE WITH THE CBI.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.721
AGENT LISBON. MR. JANE.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.421
WON'T YOU SIT DOWN?

13:33.421 --> 13:35.989
WELL, DON'T MIND IF WE DO.

13:35.989 --> 13:39.993
I WAS JUST TELLING MR. SHARIF
THAT HIS SPIRIT IS TROUBLED.

13:39.993 --> 13:42.212
THERE'S A WRONG
THAT HE BURNS TO RECTIFY.

13:42.212 --> 13:44.127
MM, INTERESTING.

13:44.127 --> 13:47.130
HECTOR WAS AN OLD FRIEND.
I, UH, PUSHED HIM

13:47.130 --> 13:50.481
TO TAKE UP
THE TRAFFICKING PROBLEM.

13:50.481 --> 13:53.745
NATURALLY,
I FEEL RESPONSIBLE.THEY'RE GREAT GLASSES.

13:53.745 --> 13:54.703
YEAH.COULD--COULD I TRY THOSE?

13:54.703 --> 13:57.749
UH, NO.OKAY.

13:57.749 --> 14:01.318
MR. SHARIF, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE OFF THE SUNGLASSES?

14:01.318 --> 14:02.929

14:02.929 --> 14:05.148

14:10.371 --> 14:13.330
YOU GOT A... OWIE.

14:13.330 --> 14:16.246
IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.
HE WAS DRUNK.

14:16.246 --> 14:19.859
IT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH ILSA, BY ANY CHANCE?

14:19.859 --> 14:23.384
[chuckles]
IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT.IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THAT.

14:23.384 --> 14:26.517
YOU HAVE A STRONG CONNECTION
WITH ILSA--A BOND.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.780
SEE?

14:28.780 --> 14:33.002
[sighs and clears throat]
ILSA AND I WERE VERY CLOSE.

14:33.002 --> 14:35.657
UH... [exhales deeply]

14:35.657 --> 14:39.182
BY CHANCE, WE FOUND OURSELVES
HERE ALONE ON THE FIRST NIGHT.

14:39.182 --> 14:42.055
I EXPRESSED
MY DEEP ADMIRATION FOR HER.

14:42.055 --> 14:45.667
SHE RETURNED MY FEELINGS
BUT WAS AFRAID TO ACT ON IT.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.147
HECTOR FOUND OUT.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.758
HYPOCRITE THAT HE IS,
HE ATTACKED ME.

14:49.758 --> 14:53.066
HOW IS HE A HYPOCRITE?BECAUSE HE WAS UNFAITHFUL
TO HER.

14:53.066 --> 14:56.460
MM. I DID SAY.

14:56.460 --> 15:01.117
MR. SHARIF, YOU WERE SAYING
THAT MR. BRAVA WAS UNFAITHFUL?

15:01.117 --> 15:03.163
I'M A PACIFIST, NOT A COWARD.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.078
YOU DON'T STRIKE ME
WITHOUT REPERCUSSIONS.

15:05.078 --> 15:08.037
I WENT TO HIS SUITE
THE NIGHT BEFORE HE DIED

15:08.037 --> 15:10.126
TO CONFRONT HIM.

15:10.126 --> 15:13.825
A WOMAN WAS LEAVING.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.656
IT WASN'T ILSA.

15:18.656 --> 15:21.094
WAS IT SOMEONE
FROM THE CONFERENCE?

15:21.094 --> 15:23.661
[laughs] IT WASN'T THAT KIND
OF WOMAN.

15:23.661 --> 15:26.708
SHE WAS YOUNG, PRETTY,
UH, CHEAP CLOTHES.

15:26.708 --> 15:29.624
I ASSUME
SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE.CARMEN.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.460
[Cho] FAR AS I CAN TELL,

15:39.460 --> 15:42.115

DATING AGAIN? DO YOU?

TO THIS POINT SO QUICKLY?

IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.227
WHAT WOULD?

UH, CHARGING LYNCH WITH BRAVA'S
MURDER. HOW CLOSE ARE WE?

A CONFESSION WOULD HELP.WELL, WHY DON'T YOU ASK
ONE OF HER SPIRITS?

THE EVIDENCE

TO CONCEAL WAS CONTEMPT.

WORTH KILLING.

A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TARIQ SHARIF?

20:50.814 --> 20:53.861
HE WAS DRUNK. HE SAID THINGS
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID,

20:53.861 --> 20:56.820
AND I EXCUSED MYSELF
FROM HIS COMPANY.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.519
AND THEN YOUR HUSBAND
PUNCHED HIM IN THE FACE.

20:59.519 --> 21:02.522
I DIDN'T TELL HECTOR
TO HIT HIM,

21:02.522 --> 21:04.524
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.395
I WON'T PRETEND
I'M PARTICULARLY SAD

21:06.395 --> 21:08.484

21:08.484 --> 21:11.487
HE SAID THINGS THAT HE--

21:11.487 --> 21:13.924
HE ACTED LIKE A PIG
AND AN ASS.

21:13.924 --> 21:16.231

THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.931
WE NEED TO ASK YOU AGAIN

21:20.931 --> 21:24.457
ABOUT THE NIGHT
BEFORE HECTOR DIED.

21:24.457 --> 21:28.156
[exhales deeply] I, UM...

21:28.156 --> 21:30.767

IS THERE ANY CHANCE

21:35.294 --> 21:39.080

VISITING WITH HECTOR THAT NIGHT?

HE'S LYING.

I-I GUESS I SHOULD GO.

21:55.792 --> 21:58.447

SO, UH...

22:00.449 --> 22:02.799
YEAH, I'M GONNA CATCH
A CAB OUT FRONT.

22:02.799 --> 22:04.323

WELL, BUSINESS MANAGER, THEN.

23:36.153 --> 23:38.112
CONCERNED FRIEND.

23:38.112 --> 23:40.984
WHATEVER. WE'D LIKE TO TAKE
OUR LITTLE SOIREE UPSTAIRS

23:40.984 --> 23:43.857
TO A MORE PRIVATE LOCATION.

23:43.857 --> 23:46.686
NOVELLA SAYS THAT
WE HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

23:46.686 --> 23:49.863
IF IT'S GONNA BE THE TWO OF YOU,
IT'S GONNA BE EXTRA.

23:52.866 --> 23:54.476
[sighs]

23:54.476 --> 23:58.045
SURE. SHE'S PAYING.

23:58.045 --> 24:00.787
I SHOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU
THAT I AM AGENT

24:00.787 --> 24:02.745
FOR THE CALIFORNIA
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.

24:02.745 --> 24:05.269
OH, WOW.

24:05.269 --> 24:08.142
SHE HAS A GUN, TOO.
AND HANDCUFFS.WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

24:08.142 --> 24:11.928
THIS IS ENTRAPMENT.
I WANT A LAWYER.WHAT YOU WANT IS TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THIS PICTURE

24:11.928 --> 24:14.322
AND TELL ME
IF YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN.

24:14.322 --> 24:17.456
[sighs]
NOPE. NEVER SEEN HIM.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.937
BUT THAT GUY--
HIM I RECOGNIZE.

24:20.937 --> 24:24.637
HE WAS IN HERE GETTING A GIRL
JUST THE OTHER NIGHT.

24:24.637 --> 24:26.856
NO. NO WAY.

24:26.856 --> 24:29.903
LOOK, I MIGHT NOT BE DENZEL,
BUT I DO OKAY.

24:29.903 --> 24:32.340
BESIDES, I COULDN'T AFFORD
A PROSTITUTE ON MY SALARY,

24:32.340 --> 24:35.561
BELIEVE ME.NOT FOR YOU.
FOR YOUR BOSS, BRAVA.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.259
IS THAT SOMETHING
YOU DID A LOT OF--

24:38.259 --> 24:39.869
PROCURING WOMEN FOR HIM?

24:39.869 --> 24:41.741
[scoffs]

24:41.741 --> 24:44.265
WOW. THE MAN'S DEAD.

24:44.265 --> 24:45.919
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY GONNA

24:45.919 --> 24:48.965
DRAG HIS NAME THROUGH THE MUD
LIKE THIS?

24:48.965 --> 24:51.272
I'M NOT LOOKING TO DESTROY
ANYBODY'S REPUTATION, RUSSELL.

24:51.272 --> 24:55.102
I JUST NEED
TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

24:55.102 --> 24:57.060
ILSA WAS BACK IN BERKELEY.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.280
HE CALLED ME

24:59.280 --> 25:02.283
AND SAID HE NEEDED ME
TO DO HIM A FAVOR.

25:02.283 --> 25:05.634
HE COULDN'T GO DOWN
TO THE BAR HIMSELF,

25:05.634 --> 25:07.636
BECAUSE SOMEBODY WOULD
RECOGNIZE HIM.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.595
SOMEBODY COULD'VE
RECOGNIZED YOU.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.248
NOBODY DID.

25:11.248 --> 25:12.902
I WAS LUCKY.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.948
IT WAS HARD FOR YOU.

25:14.948 --> 25:16.950
SURE.

25:16.950 --> 25:20.606
SURE, IT WOULD'VE BEEN EASIER
IF HE DIDN'T DO IT AT ALL,

25:20.606 --> 25:22.564
BUT... [chuckles]

25:22.564 --> 25:26.612
LOOK, A-ALL I COULD DO WAS JUST
KEEP HIM FROM GETTING CAUGHT.

25:26.612 --> 25:30.006
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN TELL US ABOUT THE GIRL?

25:30.006 --> 25:31.399
UH...

25:31.399 --> 25:34.750
I THINK
HER NAME WAS... CLARET.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.927
CLARET.IT'S FRENCH.

25:37.927 --> 25:40.843
WHAT DID BRAVA MEAN
WHEN HE SAID

25:40.843 --> 25:42.932
HE WANTED
TO MAKE IT REGULAR?

25:42.932 --> 25:45.544
WELL, I MEAN, NOT,
LIKE, ACTUALLY REGULAR,

25:45.544 --> 25:47.589
BECAUSE HE DIED AND ALL,

25:47.589 --> 25:50.461
BUT EVERY THURSDAY AFTERNOON,
IT WAS GONNA BE.

25:50.461 --> 25:54.204
HE HAD A PLACE UP
IN OAKLAND, HE TOLD ME.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.206
DO YOU HAVE AN ADDRESS?

25:56.206 --> 25:58.644
SURE. AND A KEY, TOO.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.994
I THINK IT'S THIS ONE
ON THE LEFT.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.517
YEAH.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.523
[keys jangle]

26:08.523 --> 26:10.786
[lock clicks]

26:15.269 --> 26:17.880
SO WOULD YOU EVER,
UH... [sighs]

26:17.880 --> 26:19.273
YOU KNOW...

26:19.273 --> 26:21.057
PAY FOR SEX? NO.

26:21.057 --> 26:22.798
YEAH. IT'S WEIRD, RIGHT?

26:22.798 --> 26:25.584
WEIRD? NO. EXPENSIVE.

26:27.629 --> 26:30.066
HEY.

26:30.066 --> 26:32.721
CHECK THIS OUT.

26:32.721 --> 26:35.419
"CARMEN."

26:35.419 --> 26:37.030
BINGO.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.509
[Lisbon] WHAT DO YOU GOT?

26:38.509 --> 26:41.382
[Cho] WELL, WE TRACKED
CARMEN'S PHONE NUMBER.

26:41.382 --> 26:44.994
IT'S AN APARTMENT RENTED
TO A SALLY ALVAREZ.SO "CARMEN" WAS JUST A NAME
SHE USED FOR WORK?

26:44.994 --> 26:47.910
MM. ALVAREZ HAS BEEN PICKED UP
A COUPLE TIMES FOR SOLICITING,

26:47.910 --> 26:49.520
ONCE FOR POSSESSION.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.741
SHE SKIPPED ON THAT APARTMENT
ABOUT A MONTH AGO,

26:52.741 --> 26:55.352
BUT HER P.O. GAVE US AN ADDRESS
THAT WAS GOOD AS OF LAST WEEK.CALL BURNSIDE. TELL HIM
WE'RE GONNA PICK HER UP.

26:55.352 --> 26:58.268
HEY, BOSS. THERE WAS
A CARMEN REYES WHO CALLED BRAVA

26:58.268 --> 27:01.010
ON HIS HOTEL PHONE TWICE
THE NIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

27:01.010 --> 27:03.926
LEFT HER NAME ON
THE HOTEL MESSAGING SYSTEM.THERE'S NO RECORD
OF SALLY ALVAREZ

27:03.926 --> 27:07.190
CALLING THE HOTEL--
HOME OR CELL.WHERE DID THE CALL
ORIGINATE FROM?

27:07.190 --> 27:09.758
SUNSET HORIZON MOTOR COURT
IN SAN DESIDERA.

27:09.758 --> 27:13.240
A CARMEN REYES CHECKED IN
TWO DAYS AGO. SHE'S STILL THERE.ALL RIGHT.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.851
THEN WE'VE GOT TWO LOCATIONS
TO LOOK FOR HER AT.OR WE HAVE TWO CARMENS.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.418
TWO CARMENS?

27:17.418 --> 27:20.639
TWO CARMENS.WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
TWO CARMENS?

27:20.639 --> 27:22.902
WELL, IT MEANS
THINGS ARE GETTING INTERESTING.

27:22.902 --> 27:25.034
AH, WELL, AS LONG
AS IT'S INTERESTING FOR YOU.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.906
I'LL GO WITH VAN PELT.

27:30.257 --> 27:33.390
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT MOTELS--

27:33.390 --> 27:37.525
OLD-FASHIONED AND ILLICIT,
BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.483
IS THAT AN INVITATION?

27:39.483 --> 27:42.835
WHOA. WELL, LOOK AT YOU, JUST
SHOWING UP LIKE A BAD PENNY.

27:42.835 --> 27:45.272
I HAD A PREMONITION
YOU'D BE HERE.

27:45.272 --> 27:47.100
REALLY?

27:47.100 --> 27:48.971
NO. LISBON TOLD ME.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.756
AH.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.975
UPSTAIRS. 204.

27:52.975 --> 27:55.630
GRACE, YOU KNOW KRISTINA?YEAH. HI.

27:55.630 --> 27:58.981
[Kristina] HI.DID YOUR PSYCHIC POWERS
TELL YOU TO COME?

27:58.981 --> 28:01.462
I DID HAVE AN INSTINCT
YOU WERE ABOUT TO GET

28:01.462 --> 28:04.073
A BREAK IN THIS CASE.[Patrick] OH, I THINK
YOU MIGHT HAVE JUST

28:04.073 --> 28:06.423
MADE AGENT VAN PELT'S DAY.[Van Pelt] WE'RE LOOKING
FOR CARMEN REYES.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.425
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE
TWO ADDRESSES FOR HER.

28:08.425 --> 28:11.385
THIS IS JUST ONE OF 'EM.
HER REAL NAME IS SALLY ALVAREZ.

28:11.385 --> 28:14.040
WAIT A SECOND. SALLY ALVAREZ.
I KNOW THAT NAME.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.346
SHE COMMUNICATED WITH ME
A SHORT TIME AGO.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.131
SHE'S PASSED OVER.

28:18.131 --> 28:21.612
I'M PRETTY SURE
SHE'S STILL IN THERE.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.005
[knocks on door]

28:23.005 --> 28:24.615
SALLY?

28:24.615 --> 28:26.008
[knocks]SALLY?

28:26.008 --> 28:28.402
OPEN IT UP.[lock clicks]

28:28.402 --> 28:30.709
STEP BACK, SIR.[man] OH.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.062
SHE'S DOWN.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.591
HEY, CHO.[Cho]
We found Sally Alvarez.

28:43.591 --> 28:46.463
SHE'S BEEN DEAD
FOR ABOUT SIX HOURS.

28:46.463 --> 28:49.728
Blunt force trauma
to the head.SHE'S DEAD? OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S AMAZING.

28:49.728 --> 28:53.819
WHY?Kristina Frye said Sally
passed over. She predicted it.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.690
SHE DID?YES.

28:55.690 --> 28:57.692
CAN I HAVE THAT?
THANK YOU.

28:57.692 --> 28:59.694
CHO, PLEASE DO NOT BELIEVE
THIS MYSTIC MUMBO JUMBO.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.609
GULLIBLE GRACE BURIED THE LEAD.

29:01.609 --> 29:05.004
[Patrick] I was right.
There were two Carmens.THERE WERE?

29:05.004 --> 29:08.007
THAT'S RIGHT, AND WE HAVE
THE REAL ONE RIGHT HERE.

29:08.007 --> 29:12.359
CARMEN REYES. SHE CLAIMS TO BE
HECTOR BRAVA'S DAUGHTER.

29:17.451 --> 29:20.323
A YEAR AGO, MY MOTHER WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER.

29:20.323 --> 29:22.848
UH, IT GOT BAD VERY FAST.

29:22.848 --> 29:25.111
SHE WAS GONE
IN LESS THAN A MONTH.

29:25.111 --> 29:28.679
BEFORE SHE DIED, SHE TOLD ME HECTOR BRAVA WAS MY FATHER.

29:28.679 --> 29:32.248
AND AFTER THE FUNERAL, I WROTE TO HIM.

29:32.248 --> 29:34.120
I NEVER HEARD BACK.

29:34.120 --> 29:38.689
I THOUGHT
MAYBE HE'D FORGOTTEN HER.

29:38.689 --> 29:41.301
I WROTE THERE WAS NOTHING
I WANTED FROM HIM,

29:41.301 --> 29:44.652
ONLY TO MEET THE MAN
WHO WAS MY FATHER.

29:44.652 --> 29:46.306
HE STILL DIDN'T ANSWER?

29:46.306 --> 29:49.700
I SAW SOMEWHERE THAT HE WAS
DELIVERING A SPEECH HERE.

29:49.700 --> 29:53.487
[chuckles] I THOUGHT
I'D GO CONFRONT HIM.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.097
YOU WERE ANGRY.

29:55.097 --> 29:57.883
I WANTED TO TALK TO HIM.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.798
DID YOU?

29:59.798 --> 30:01.190
WHEN?

30:01.190 --> 30:03.453
THE MORNING HE DIED?

30:03.453 --> 30:05.064
THE NIGHT BEFORE.

30:05.064 --> 30:07.457
I WENT TO HIS SUITE.

30:07.457 --> 30:09.808
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.635
HE LET ME IN.

30:11.635 --> 30:14.943
HE WAS FRIENDLY,

30:14.943 --> 30:18.599
UNTIL I TOLD HIM
I WAS HIS DAUGHTER.

30:18.599 --> 30:23.778
HE GOT VERY UPSET
AND ANGRY.

30:23.778 --> 30:26.346
[Carmen] HE SAID,
I COULD NOT BE HIS DAUGHTER.

30:26.346 --> 30:29.175
HE SAID,
HE ALREADY MET HIS DAUGHTER,

30:29.175 --> 30:32.526
AND WHAT KIND OF SCAM WAS I TRYING TO PLAY?

30:32.526 --> 30:35.485
HE TURNED SO PALE
AND SHOOK ALL OVER.

30:35.485 --> 30:38.924
HE THREW ME
OUT OF THE ROOM

30:38.924 --> 30:40.534
AND LOCKED THE DOOR,

30:40.534 --> 30:42.536
SO I LEFT.

30:45.321 --> 30:47.497
AND THAT WAS LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

30:49.804 --> 30:52.241
ON THE NEWS,
IT SAID WHAT HAPPENED.

30:54.156 --> 30:56.158
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

30:56.158 --> 30:58.160
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE TEXT MESSAGE?

30:58.160 --> 30:59.509
DID YOU SEND THAT?

30:59.509 --> 31:02.904
I DON'T HAVE A PHONE.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.950
SO IS SHE TELLING
THE TRUTH?

31:04.950 --> 31:06.386
I'M NOT SURE.

31:06.386 --> 31:08.605
BRAVA'S SPIRIT IS
DEEPLY CONFLICTED.

31:08.605 --> 31:12.131
I CAN'T GET A CLEAR READING.WHAT ARE YOU USING,
DIAL-UP?

31:12.131 --> 31:15.177
[Lisbon] MY QUESTION IS,
IF SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH,

31:15.177 --> 31:18.398
WHY WAS SALLY ALVAREZ PRETENDING
TO BE CARMEN REYES?

31:18.398 --> 31:20.052
I TALKED TO BIGELOW.

31:20.052 --> 31:22.184
HE KEPT A RECORD
OF ALL WORK CORRESPONDENCES

31:22.184 --> 31:25.231
BUT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH BRAVA'S PERSONAL LETTERS.

31:25.231 --> 31:29.104
THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW
IF HER STORY CHECKS OUT OR NOT.IF BRAVA'S HER FATHER,
SHE'S GOT MOTIVE.

31:29.104 --> 31:31.280
SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.416
[Ilsa]
I COULD NEVER HAVE CHILDREN.

31:39.114 --> 31:40.420
IS IT TRUE?

31:40.420 --> 31:42.639
IS SHE REALLY
HECTOR'S DAUGHTER?

31:42.639 --> 31:44.511
WE DON'T KNOW, MA'AM.

31:44.511 --> 31:48.384
SHE'S AGREED TO TAKE
A PATERNITY TEST.

31:48.384 --> 31:51.735
I THINK SHE MIGHT BE
TELLING THE TRUTH.SO YOU THINK SHE MIGHT BE
THE ONE THAT KILLED HECTOR.

31:51.735 --> 31:54.303
WELL, MAYBE...
AND THEN MAYBE IT WAS YOU.

31:54.303 --> 31:57.306
I HAVE TO SAY, MA'AM,
I-IT'S PRETTY HARD TO BELIEVE

31:57.306 --> 32:00.266
THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR.

32:00.266 --> 32:03.443
YES, I KNEW. HECTOR WAS
A PASSIONATE AND HEROIC MAN

32:03.443 --> 32:06.228
WHO DEVOTED HIMSELF
TO HELPING OTHERS.

32:06.228 --> 32:08.752
HIS FLAWS WERE
CORRESPONDINGLY OVERSIZED.

32:08.752 --> 32:11.103
AND HIS BEHAVIOR WAS OKAY
WITH YOU?

32:11.103 --> 32:13.453
I ACCEPTED IT.

32:13.453 --> 32:16.456
THE GOOD IN HIM OUTWEIGHED
THE BAD.

32:16.456 --> 32:18.110
IF HE'D TOLD ME,

32:18.110 --> 32:20.503
MAYBE I COULD'VE DONE
SOMETHING TO PREVENT IT.

32:20.503 --> 32:24.420
MAYBE I COULD'VE SAVED HIM.WHAT FOR?
HOW COULD YOU NOT WANT

32:24.420 --> 32:27.075
TO GET AWAY
FROM HIS SERIAL PHILANDERING,

32:27.075 --> 32:30.296
FROM THE PRISON
OF YOUR LOVELESS MARRIAGE?THAT'S NOT TRUE!

32:30.296 --> 32:32.951
I LOVED MY HUSBAND,
AND HE LOVED ME!

32:32.951 --> 32:36.519
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN GET
IN CONTACT WITH HIM NOW.

32:36.519 --> 32:39.696
YOU COULD DO THAT,
COULDN'T YOU?IT WOULD CERTAINLY CLEAR UP
A FEW THINGS.

32:39.696 --> 32:43.657
WOULD YOU DO THAT?
WOULD YOU TALK TO MY HUSBAND?

32:43.657 --> 32:46.181
YES, ILSA.

32:46.181 --> 32:48.488
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?WHAT DOES IT LOOK
LIKE I'M DOING?

32:50.316 --> 32:52.971
OKAY, SO VAN PELT IS
BRINGING CARMEN.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.973
RIGSBY'S GONNA BRING
RICHARD BIGELOW.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.932
CHO IS GONNA PICK UP
TARIQ SHARIF AND STACEY.

32:57.932 --> 32:59.325
SO WE'RE ALL SET.

32:59.325 --> 33:01.327
WHAT'S ALL SET FOR WHAT?

33:01.327 --> 33:04.417

FOR, UH, KRISTINA FRYE

33:04.417 --> 33:07.202

HECTOR BRAVA'S SPIRIT.I NEED EVERYBODY CONNECTED
WITH HIS PASSING.

33:07.202 --> 33:10.771
OKAY. WELL, UH, I GUESS...
[clears throat][lowered voice]
NOW LISTEN, JUST MAKE SURE

33:10.771 --> 33:13.034
BRAVA'S SPIRIT HAS A THIRST
FOR REVENGE.

33:13.034 --> 33:16.037
HE WANTS TO PUT SOME KIND
OF A CURSE ON THE KILLER,

33:16.037 --> 33:18.779
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
THAT KIND OF THING.

33:18.779 --> 33:22.174
AND THEN I'LL TAKE IT
FROM THERE.I CAN'T DO THAT.

33:22.174 --> 33:25.133
YES, YOU CAN.
IT IS A NECESSARY LIE.I CAN ONLY CONTACT
HECTOR BRAVA'S SPIRIT

33:25.133 --> 33:27.483
AND SPEAK
AS HE WANTS ME TO.

33:27.483 --> 33:30.008
TO DO OTHERWISE WOULD BE
TO ABUSE MY GIFT.

33:33.228 --> 33:34.882
EVERYTHING OKAY?

33:34.882 --> 33:36.840
YEP. EVERYTHING'S GOOD.
IT'S PERFECT.

33:39.974 --> 33:42.194
[Ilsa] ARE WE STARTING NOW?

33:42.194 --> 33:43.586
[Kristina] ALMOST.

33:43.586 --> 33:45.545
I'LL JUST GET THE DOOR.

33:45.545 --> 33:47.808
WELCOME.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.940
[Patrick] COME ON IN.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.899
THANKS FOR COMING.

33:53.422 --> 33:56.034
IT WAS
YOUR HUSBAND'S REQUEST.

33:57.383 --> 34:00.038
YOUR HUSBAND'S DAUGHTER.

34:05.652 --> 34:08.220
[clears throat]

34:08.220 --> 34:09.873
[sighs]

34:09.873 --> 34:13.616
WELL, THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

34:13.616 --> 34:15.618
PATRICK WILL BE
ASSISTING ME.

34:15.618 --> 34:18.273
SO IN ORDER
FOR THIS TO WORK,

34:18.273 --> 34:21.363
I NEED EVERYBODY
TO BE CALM AND FOCUSED.

34:21.363 --> 34:24.975
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THE CANDLE
IN THE CENTER OF THE TABLE.

34:24.975 --> 34:28.544
FOCUS ON THE FLAME
AND CONCENTRATE ON HECTOR.

34:36.161 --> 34:37.771
[inhales deeply]

34:37.771 --> 34:41.731
[exhales deeply]

34:44.038 --> 34:47.215
NOW... HE'S HERE.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.524
I CAN FEEL HIM.

34:53.830 --> 34:56.659
HECTOR...

34:56.659 --> 35:00.794
WHO DO YOU WISH
TO SPEAK TO?

35:00.794 --> 35:02.187
[gasps]

35:02.187 --> 35:04.058
[exhales deeply]

35:04.058 --> 35:05.320
THE KILLER'S HERE.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.935
KNOW THIS--

35:11.935 --> 35:14.460
HECTOR BRAVA SAYS...

35:14.460 --> 35:17.419
VENGEANCE WILL COME.

35:17.419 --> 35:20.118
YOUR BLOOD WILL SPILL...

35:20.118 --> 35:23.077
[Patrick exhales deeply]BEFORE THE RISING SUN.

35:23.077 --> 35:27.212
OHH. I SENSE HIM.

35:27.212 --> 35:30.171
[exhales deeply]

35:30.171 --> 35:32.304
I-I CAN ALMOST SEE
AN IMAGE.

35:32.304 --> 35:33.609
I-I-IT'S HAZY.

35:35.437 --> 35:38.397
OH, IT...

35:38.397 --> 35:40.964
OHH,
IT'S AS IF IT COULD JUST--

35:40.964 --> 35:42.401
HECTOR. HECTOR, WAIT.

35:42.401 --> 35:44.751
STOP. DON'T GO.

35:44.751 --> 35:46.622
SHOW US
WHO THE KILLER IS.

35:46.622 --> 35:49.234
THERE IT IS.

35:49.234 --> 35:51.932
A DOOR.

35:51.932 --> 35:55.457
"EMPLOYEES ONLY."

35:55.457 --> 35:57.807
AND AN EMPTY HALLWAY.

35:57.807 --> 35:59.331
[footsteps echoing]

35:59.331 --> 36:02.421
FOOTSTEPS... CLOSE...

36:02.421 --> 36:04.379
CLOSE...

36:04.379 --> 36:06.033
[thud]

36:06.033 --> 36:07.991
AAH! UGH![gasps] OH!

36:07.991 --> 36:10.603
I SEE YOU.

36:10.603 --> 36:13.345
[Richard exhales deeply]
I'M SORRY.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.173
MAN, YOU SCARED ME
TO DEATH WITH THAT.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.393
[chuckles] WHEW.IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN RELAX, BIGELOW.

36:18.393 --> 36:22.136
IT'S OVER. I KNOW
IT WAS YOU THAT DID IT.WHAT, BECAUSE I GOT FRANTIC
AND FELL OUT OF MY CHAIR?

36:22.136 --> 36:24.356
BECAUSE YOU MANAGED
BRAVA'S CORRESPONDENCE,

36:24.356 --> 36:26.836
YOU WERE THE FIRST ONE
TO READ CARMEN'S LETTERS, YES?

36:26.836 --> 36:29.056
YOU SET BRAVA UP
ON A DATE WITH SALLY

36:29.056 --> 36:32.059
AND HAD HER PRETEND TO BE
CARMEN, AND THEN YOU TOLD BRAVA

36:32.059 --> 36:35.541
THAT HE HAD SEX
WITH HIS OWN DAUGHTER.LORD.

36:35.541 --> 36:38.674
AND THEN THE REAL DEAL
SHOWED UP,

36:38.674 --> 36:41.634
SO YOU FAKED CARMEN'S MESSAGE,
AND WHEN BRAVA WALKED THROUGH

36:41.634 --> 36:44.027
THAT SERVICE DOOR,
YOU KILLED HIM.

36:44.027 --> 36:45.986
[Lisbon] AND YOU KILLED
POOR SALLY ALVAREZ

36:45.986 --> 36:48.380
TO COVER YOUR TRACKS.[Patrick] MM-HMM.

36:48.380 --> 36:52.079
AND NOW YOU'LL PAY
FOR THE CRIME YOU COMMITTED.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.429
YOUR BLOOD WILL SPILL
BEFORE THE SUN RISES.

36:54.429 --> 36:58.041
THAT PART
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.267
[Bigelow]
IT CAME IN THE MAIL.

37:06.267 --> 37:09.401
JUST OUT OF THE BLUE.
JUST A...

37:09.401 --> 37:13.318
LETTER DESCRIBING AN AFFAIR
BRAVA HAD 20 YEARS AGO,

37:13.318 --> 37:15.363
NAMING THE WOMAN
AND THE PLACE.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.670
AND THAT CAME FROM CARMEN REYES.
THE REAL CARMEN.

37:19.628 --> 37:21.587
THAT GAVE YOU
ALL THE FACTS YOU NEEDED--

37:21.587 --> 37:23.328
THINGS ABOUT THE AFFAIR

37:23.328 --> 37:26.113
THAT ONLY BRAVA
AND CARMEN'S MOTHER WOULD KNOW.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.984
RIGHT?YEAH.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.994
SO WHY'D YOU DO IT?

37:37.994 --> 37:40.693
WHY PUT A MAN
THROUGH THAT KIND OF SUFFERING?

37:42.477 --> 37:44.523
WAS IT THE MONEY?

37:44.523 --> 37:48.048
OR DID YOU JUST LIKE
HAVING BRAVA IN YOUR POWER?

37:48.048 --> 37:51.007
DO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN RUNNING
NUMBERS ON TRAFFICKING FOR BRAVA

37:51.007 --> 37:55.142
AND SETTING HIM UP ON HIS DATES
FOR, LIKE, FIVE YEARS?

37:55.142 --> 37:58.101
AND DO YOU THINK THAT HE EVER,

37:58.101 --> 38:00.495
EVER THANKED ME?

38:00.495 --> 38:02.541
SAID, "I'M SORRY"?

38:02.541 --> 38:06.240
SAID, "I'M GONNA MAKE THIS UP
TO YOU ONE DAY, RUSSELL"?

38:06.240 --> 38:10.505
I KNEW SALLY
FROM A WHOREHOUSE

38:10.505 --> 38:12.551
UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

38:12.551 --> 38:15.118
I TOLD HER
IF SHE PRETENDED TO BE CARMEN,

38:15.118 --> 38:17.773
WE COULD BLACKMAIL BRAVA
AND SPLIT THE MONEY.

38:17.773 --> 38:20.167
THE LETTER JUST GAVE US
EVERYTHING WE NEEDED

38:20.167 --> 38:23.170
TO MAKE BRAVA THINK THAT SHE
WAS THE REAL DEAL. [chuckles]

38:23.170 --> 38:26.739
AND HE WAS NOT ONE FOR ASKING
A WHOLE LOT OF QUESTIONS, SO...

38:29.611 --> 38:31.613
THEN THE REAL CARMEN
SHOWED UP.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.354
YEAH.

38:33.354 --> 38:36.314
HE CALLED ME
AS SOON AS SHE LEFT HIS ROOM,

38:36.314 --> 38:39.360
FREAKED. SO I PLAYED DUMB.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.971
BUT THEN THE NEXT MORNING,
HE CALLED ME

38:41.971 --> 38:44.322
AND HE SAID,
"WE NEED TO TALK."

38:44.322 --> 38:46.672
IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR
HE FIGURED IT OUT.

38:46.672 --> 38:48.674
AND SO YOU WENT TO THE HOTEL

38:48.674 --> 38:50.850
AND TEXTED BRAVA
FROM THE SERVICE HALLWAY.

39:01.513 --> 39:02.775
[crash]

39:11.174 --> 39:15.091
I JUST--I JUST WANTED
TO KEEP HIM QUIET.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.702
AND SALLY ALVAREZ?

39:16.702 --> 39:19.313
YOU HAD TO KEEP HER QUIET,
TOO, RIGHT?

39:21.576 --> 39:25.232
YOU KNOW,
I WAS A REALLY GOOD RESEARCHER.

39:25.232 --> 39:28.278
I BET.

39:28.278 --> 39:30.193
COME ON.

39:37.026 --> 39:39.202
AGENT VAN PELT,
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

39:39.202 --> 39:41.248
OH, YEAH. HI, CARMEN.

39:41.248 --> 39:44.207
I JUST WANTED TO GO OVER
A FEW THINGS IN YOUR STATEMENT.

39:44.207 --> 39:46.122
LET'S GO IN THE KITCHEN.

39:52.955 --> 39:54.261
SO... [sighs]

39:56.132 --> 39:58.221
NICE WORKING WITH YOU.

39:58.221 --> 40:00.267
YEAH.

40:00.267 --> 40:02.487
YEAH, YOU WERE VERY GOOD
BACK THERE.

40:02.487 --> 40:05.098
UH, YOU ALMOST HAD ME
WITH THE WHOLE

40:05.098 --> 40:08.101
"I CAN'T MISUSE MY GIFT FOR FEAR
OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN" BIT.

40:08.101 --> 40:10.146
I DID WHAT I SAID I WOULD.

40:10.146 --> 40:12.975
I SPOKE THE WORDS THE SPIRITS
TOLD ME TO SPEAK, NOTHING MORE.

40:12.975 --> 40:15.238
REALLY?

40:15.238 --> 40:17.240
DON'T YOU KNOW ME BY NOW?

40:17.240 --> 40:20.635
DON'T YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T LIE
ABOUT A THING LIKE THAT?

40:20.635 --> 40:23.508
MS. FRYE,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

40:23.508 --> 40:27.163
WE COULDN'T HAVE CLOSED THIS ONE
WITHOUT YOU.WELL, THAT'S DEBATABLE.

40:27.163 --> 40:28.730
YOU'RE WELCOME.

40:28.730 --> 40:30.776
ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO SAY

40:30.776 --> 40:33.169
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SPIRITS
GOT IT WRONG.

40:33.169 --> 40:36.129
I GUESS BEING DEAD
DOESN'T MAKE YOU INFALLIBLE.WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40:36.129 --> 40:38.871
THE KILLER WAS CAUGHT,
AND JUSTICE WAS SERVED.

40:38.871 --> 40:40.568
SURE.
BUT NO BLOOD WAS SPILLED.

40:40.568 --> 40:43.397
LOOK, HE'S RIGHT THERE.

40:43.397 --> 40:46.095
[crunch]HEY! HEY, HEY!

40:46.095 --> 40:48.446
MURDERER! [grunts]

40:48.446 --> 40:50.448
OH!

40:50.448 --> 40:53.886
[gasping]

40:55.627 --> 40:58.194
OH, COME ON.

41:01.241 --> 41:03.025
THAT WAS PURE LUCK.

41:03.025 --> 41:04.157
ADMIT IT.

41:04.157 --> 41:05.811
IF YOU SAY SO.

41:05.811 --> 41:07.639
OH, I KNOWSO.

41:07.639 --> 41:11.077
THE DEAD ARE DEAD.
YOU CAN'T TALK TO THEM.

41:11.077 --> 41:13.427
AND YET I DO.

41:13.427 --> 41:16.909
YEAH...

41:16.909 --> 41:19.302
YOU'RE VERY GOOD.

41:19.302 --> 41:21.479
I GO THIS WAY.

41:21.479 --> 41:24.046
OKAY.IT WAS NICE
SEEING YOU AGAIN.

41:24.046 --> 41:25.831

KRISTINA?

41:29.487 --> 41:31.489

41:31.489 --> 41:33.099
THAT'S WITH A "K," RIGHT?

41:33.099 --> 41:34.709
YES.

41:36.668 --> 41:39.758

BUT YOU CAN DRINK
AS MUCH COFFEE AS YOU WANT.YEAH, I'D LIKE THAT.

41:44.589 --> 41:47.548

41:47.548 --> 41:49.376
UH, MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME?

41:49.376 --> 41:51.726
SOME OTHER TIME.
