I will not.
You are a criminal.

- Yeah, okay.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.234
Darkness was only
the ninth plague.

03:12.276 --> 03:15.654
Did nuns ever teach you what
the tenth and final one was?

03:15.696 --> 03:17.364
The death of the firstborn.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.408
Death, death of millions.

The death of millions.

And if you hope to stop it,

03:23.621 --> 03:26.582
we must go now.

This is a fucking
one-night stand.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.170
Clock strikes midnight,

I swear to fucking God,
you try anything,

03:37.801 --> 03:39.261
- I will shoot you.
- Yes, I'm sure.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.023
Come here!

03:58.822 --> 04:02.242
Why didn't you save me?

04:02.284 --> 04:04.119
You did this to me!

04:11.293 --> 04:13.337
It's your fault.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.265
How the bloody fuck

04:25.307 --> 04:27.434
do we know
that we can trust her?!

04:27.476 --> 04:29.120
Because if anyone
found out what I'm doing,

04:29.144 --> 04:31.063
I'd be going
on a ride 25-to-life

04:31.105 --> 04:33.482
alongside you Village People
cover band motherfuckers.

04:33.524 --> 04:34.775
- All right, stop. Enough.
- No.

04:34.817 --> 04:36.443
- Enough! Stop!
- Meyer!

04:36.485 --> 04:39.863
They just blew up
a goddamn power plant.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.782
They ravage a city.

04:41.824 --> 04:43.659
We need her.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.120
We need her resources.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.917
Where's Jonah,
and where's, uh, Murray?

04:52.918 --> 04:54.169
We got separated.

04:54.211 --> 04:55.587
And Murray ain't winning

04:55.629 --> 04:58.090
the New York City Marathon
anytime soon.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.967
And I'm-I'm fine, too,
thank you.

05:00.009 --> 05:01.760
I can feel the concern.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.559
Jonah.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.022
I'm so sorry.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.982
I'm sorry.

05:16.025 --> 05:17.901
I'm sorry.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.989
No.

05:22.031 --> 05:24.616
Oh. Oh, no.

05:28.454 --> 05:30.330
Oh, God.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.499
Today...

05:32.541 --> 05:36.336
we, too, are in total darkness,

05:36.378 --> 05:40.257
because Murray was our light.

05:40.299 --> 05:43.302
It's no secret

05:43.343 --> 05:46.680
that in the shadows
of the Shoah,

05:46.722 --> 05:49.433
Murray turned away from God,

05:49.475 --> 05:53.312
as he asked,
"How can God exist?"

05:54.563 --> 05:56.482
The irony

05:56.523 --> 05:59.610
is that the answer
to the question

05:59.651 --> 06:02.029
is Murray.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.031
A man like this

06:04.073 --> 06:08.035
is the greatest evidence
of Hashem.

06:08.077 --> 06:09.995
Not the burning bush,

06:10.037 --> 06:12.790
not the great leviathan,

06:12.831 --> 06:16.835
but a man who ushered
others to safety

06:16.877 --> 06:21.256
during that subway accident
last night.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.635
A man who came
to my office last year,

06:24.676 --> 06:26.970
unbeknownst to Mindy,

06:27.012 --> 06:29.807
and as a final gift

06:29.848 --> 06:32.518
to his faithful wife

06:32.559 --> 06:34.394
said, "Rabbi,

06:34.436 --> 06:38.941
"when she's finally succeeded
in nagging me to death,

06:38.982 --> 06:42.319
"I want the service in shul.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.822
"I want a Jewish ceremony.

06:44.863 --> 06:48.492
"Not because I believe in him,

06:48.534 --> 06:51.703
but because I believe in her."

06:54.790 --> 06:57.292
Now, forever,

06:57.334 --> 07:00.629
let us believe in Murray,

07:00.671 --> 07:05.008
for because
we have known Murray,

07:05.050 --> 07:08.762
we will forever know the light.

I could fucking scream
right now at my safta.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.044
- Yes.
- Murray, Booty.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.504
They all have one thing
in common.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.185
You know what that is?
It's me. That's me.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.566
- I fucking killed them.
- No. No, you...

16:05.590 --> 16:06.651
No, I'm responsible for that.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.343
- No.
- No, I am. It's me.

16:08.385 --> 16:10.428
I'm a fucking curse.
I'm the Grim Reaper.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.223
- I'm a fucking...
- No, don't put
their deaths on you.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.808
Come on, they're Nazi...

16:14.849 --> 16:16.744
- They're Nazi monsters.
- Do you know how I feel inside?

16:16.768 --> 16:18.954
Do you know how I... do you
understand how I feel inside?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.146
Yes. I do.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.314
I feel like I'm burning.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.941
Like I'm on fucking fire.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.627
- I want to fucking explode
right now.
- Yes.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.528
I can't stop seeing them.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.862
I fucking hesitated.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.364
I got Booty killed.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.533
- I let that lady get away.
- All right,

16:31.574 --> 16:33.785
then why did you show mercy
to that monster?

16:33.827 --> 16:35.262
- Why? Why didn't you...
- I hesitated.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.931
- Shoot that woman...
- 'Cause I hesitated.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.891
- With a child in her arms?
- I fucking hesitated.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.018
-Why didn't you do it?
-'Cause I'm a fuck...
I'm a fuckup.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.104
- Jonah, tell me why! Why?
- I'm a fuckup. I'm a fuckup.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.255
-Why?!
-I did the right thing.
I did the right thing.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.382
I did what she would have
wanted me to do.

16:50.468 --> 16:53.054
That's right.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.681
You're right.

16:54.723 --> 16:57.851
And yet,
they keep fucking winning.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.519
They keep fucking winning.

16:59.561 --> 17:02.897
Why do they get to play
by their own set of rules?

17:02.939 --> 17:06.359
Why do the good guys always have
to do the fucking right thing?

17:06.401 --> 17:07.777
We don't.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.405
Why do you have that
in your head?

17:10.447 --> 17:14.284
You had this all your life,
this thing about the comic books

17:14.325 --> 17:16.327
and crusaders and heroes.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.997
Heroes made from ink.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.331
Not blood.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.333
Heroes made of parchment.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.835
Not flesh.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.336
Fantasies.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.338
Wishes.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.548
They're lies.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.425
Jonah, they are lies.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.346
You have in you...

17:35.388 --> 17:38.224
a fire that needs
to be released.

17:40.226 --> 17:43.062
Get ready to know what it is

17:43.104 --> 17:45.815
to be a hero in this world.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.115
But I have to tell you
something now.

17:55.158 --> 17:58.745
I have to tell you why...

17:58.787 --> 18:01.664
I was unworthy of your safta.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.833
♪ ♪

18:05.877 --> 18:08.671
One night, The Wolf
came into my room.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.468
He woke me up from my dream
and dragged me outside

18:13.510 --> 18:15.470
into the woods.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.096
You have a choice.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.224
You can choose...

18:19.265 --> 18:21.726
to kill this innocent man...

18:23.561 --> 18:25.313
or...

18:26.898 --> 18:29.067
I will kill Ruth
right where she stands.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.528
Don't, Meyer...

18:31.569 --> 18:33.613
don't let him win.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.366
Let him kill me instead.

18:36.407 --> 18:39.619
That's what I want. Please.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.372
- Kill me. Kill me!
- Shh. Hey, hey.

18:42.413 --> 18:43.957
- Hey. Hey.
- Kill me!

18:43.998 --> 18:46.084
- Shh, shh.
- It's my choice.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.169
Meyerleh. Meyer.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.088
- Meyer.
- Who are you going to choose,
huh?

18:50.129 --> 18:53.967
Choose me. Shoot me, Meyer.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.008
Meyer.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.973
Myer, no.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.850
Nie, Meyer, nie!

19:11.067 --> 19:12.861
It grew quiet.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.948
And the smoke billowed

19:16.990 --> 19:19.117
from my pistol.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.757
Meyerleh?

19:36.885 --> 19:38.428
Bring me the next one!

19:38.469 --> 19:41.055
But... it was only the start.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.103
How many?

19:47.145 --> 19:48.563
How many do you think
she's worth?

19:48.605 --> 19:49.856
No, Meyer!

19:56.237 --> 19:59.574
- Meyer. Meyer.
- How many?

20:03.036 --> 20:05.079
Please, Meyer.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.998
Meyer, choose me.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.550
And I said...

20:31.022 --> 20:34.192
Perhaps this is a story...

20:34.233 --> 20:37.737
that is not meant
to be told today.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.073
Today is for Murray.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.200
We must grieve for him.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.369
We should not desecrate that.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.247
And there will be time
for this story.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.001
It deserves time.

21:03.888 --> 21:07.558
I'd recognize
those hooker heels anywhere.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.019
Didn't the nuns raise us
to be chaste?

21:12.480 --> 21:13.898
Keeping up this act

21:13.940 --> 21:15.817
finally netted you
something valuable, huh?

21:15.858 --> 21:18.528
To be perfectly frank,
I'm still shocked

21:18.569 --> 21:22.115
your off-brand Brady Bunch
hasn't figured you out yet.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.384
Tamp down your titties,
Patricia.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.368
What's wrong with it?

21:25.410 --> 21:27.120
Nothing at all, dear.
That's the point.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.746
At least on first glance.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.849
No, that's impossible.
You have to cultivate it again.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.417
Well, I cultivated
the blood again.

21:32.458 --> 21:36.045
It's infected, but with a strain
I've never seen before.

21:37.088 --> 21:38.256
Near invisible.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.676
No symptoms, no indications...

21:41.718 --> 21:44.637
until six weeks after exposure,

21:44.679 --> 21:47.890
and suddenly it detonates
inside the body like the plague.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.934
You won't know you're living
with a disease

21:49.976 --> 21:51.269
until it's too late.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.522
And with that
replication pattern,

21:54.564 --> 21:56.983
there is no cure.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.078
Hey, Mom.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.539
She's been out for a few hours.

22:11.581 --> 22:13.583
Well, I came as soon as...

22:13.624 --> 22:15.418
Are you limping?

22:15.460 --> 22:18.713
Some looters shoved me down
on 114th. I'm fine.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.049
We found an embolism.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.842
We need to monitor her closely.

22:22.884 --> 22:24.886
Keep her on blood thinners.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.347
Thank you.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.103
I went to a funeral this morning

22:34.145 --> 22:37.023
for a survivor
of the Nazi death camps.

22:38.566 --> 22:42.320
They told a story
about how this man and his wife

22:42.361 --> 22:44.322
were imprisoned
in different camps,

22:44.363 --> 22:46.240
held apart for years.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.242
But there was this one gate

22:48.284 --> 22:51.704
that all the prisoners
were marched through every day,

22:51.746 --> 22:54.832
and so this man
would pick a dandelion

22:54.874 --> 22:58.336
or a weed
or whatever he could find,

22:58.377 --> 23:02.465
and he... he'd tie it
to the fence of the barbed wire

23:02.507 --> 23:06.385
so that his wife would see it
when she would walk by.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.263
Because...

23:09.305 --> 23:12.433
even in...
all the horror and the death,

23:12.475 --> 23:14.143
he still wanted to tell her

23:14.185 --> 23:16.062
that everything
was gonna be all right.

23:16.104 --> 23:19.023
He still needed to tell her,
"I love you."

23:19.065 --> 23:22.193
And I got this feeling,
you know?

23:22.235 --> 23:24.028
And I... I called you...

23:26.405 --> 23:28.616
because I...

23:28.658 --> 23:31.202
needed...

23:31.244 --> 23:32.662
I needed to...

23:32.703 --> 23:36.124
I needed to let you know...

23:36.165 --> 23:38.209
- I... I lo...
- Nice of you

23:38.251 --> 23:40.378
to finally show up.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.048
I'm late for my rounds.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.092
Please stay and pray with us.

23:46.134 --> 23:48.136
For Viola.

23:52.223 --> 23:53.808
Almighty and Eternal God,

23:53.850 --> 23:55.893
you are the everlasting health

23:55.935 --> 23:58.062
of those who believe in you.

23:58.104 --> 24:02.108
Hear us
for your sick servant, Viola,

24:02.150 --> 24:05.528
for whom we implore
your tender mercy.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.405
Through Christ our Lord.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.407
Amen.

24:12.076 --> 24:14.579
I'll let you all visit.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.082
Hi.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.419
I'm here for you anytime, Viola.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.297
Do you want some water?
How are you feeling, Mom?

24:24.338 --> 24:26.132
Oh.

24:26.174 --> 24:29.635
Mm. I'm-I'm fine, baby.

24:29.677 --> 24:30.845
I'm fine.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.930
You don't check in for days,

24:32.972 --> 24:35.683
and now you care
how she's feeling?

24:35.725 --> 24:38.102
Your sisters were here all day.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.437
Enough, Lou.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.064
Oh. Go to the cafeteria.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.441
Cool off.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.988
I'm really sorry

24:49.030 --> 24:50.990
- I wasn't here sooner.
- Oh, it's okay.

24:51.032 --> 24:53.117
How you doing, baby?

24:53.159 --> 24:54.827
How are you doing, Ma?

24:54.869 --> 24:56.454
I'm fine.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.915
Maria made sure
I was in good hands.

25:02.543 --> 25:05.963
I would have thought she had
enough with her own patients.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.758
Oh, Melinda.

25:08.799 --> 25:11.719
My nervous system is failing me,

25:11.761 --> 25:15.014
but my eyes still work
right fine.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.600
Oh...

25:17.642 --> 25:19.685
I've known the rhythm
of your heart

25:19.727 --> 25:22.271
longer than you.

25:22.313 --> 25:27.068
And I've felt all the ways
it's made you you.

25:27.109 --> 25:29.111
Ma, whatever's
got you worked up...

25:29.153 --> 25:32.865
And as good as God, I know
when it makes you flutter.

25:34.408 --> 25:37.453
She took good care
of me, Millie.

25:37.495 --> 25:40.498
She took good care of me
for you.

25:41.999 --> 25:46.379
And if what I think's
going on between you and Maria

25:46.420 --> 25:48.464
- is really going on...
- Ma...

25:48.506 --> 25:51.884
then God don't
take these things lightly.

25:51.926 --> 25:54.262
Love...

25:54.303 --> 25:57.265
is his greatest gift...

25:57.306 --> 26:00.268
and is a treasure
you must hold on to

26:00.309 --> 26:02.186
at all costs.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.522
Don't throw it away.

26:08.985 --> 26:11.570
Don't throw it away.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.035
Oh, baby.

26:19.245 --> 26:22.331
Ah, baby.

26:22.373 --> 26:26.877
I see you. I see you.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.754
And that's right.

26:28.796 --> 26:29.815
Looks like the lights
are finally

26:29.839 --> 26:33.426
back on in the Big Apple.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.306
Right, doggy?

26:39.640 --> 26:41.809
Bad dog.

26:41.851 --> 26:44.061
She sure hates you.

26:46.355 --> 26:49.400
Did you know that there are
2,500 unique species

26:49.442 --> 26:50.609
of mayfly in the world?

26:50.651 --> 26:53.404
Yes, siree, Bob.

26:53.446 --> 26:56.490
They're unique because
they live out their entire lives

26:56.532 --> 26:59.160
in the span of a single day.

26:59.201 --> 27:01.537
Birth, maturation.

27:01.579 --> 27:06.125
They buzz and dance
and buzz and fuck.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.544
After 24 hours,

27:08.586 --> 27:11.380
they've served their entire
life's purpose.

27:11.422 --> 27:13.883
And then they do
the dignified thing.

27:13.924 --> 27:15.968
- They drop dead.
- What's your point?

27:16.010 --> 27:17.345
My point...

27:18.596 --> 27:21.724
My point is that
these Jewish insects

27:21.766 --> 27:25.728
- simply won't die.
- Hmm.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.814
They defy the course
that nature has set for them.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.317
Why? Why do they refuse

27:31.359 --> 27:33.194
to know their place
in the world?

27:33.235 --> 27:36.447
What is it that
keeps them buzzing?

27:36.489 --> 27:40.576
The way you speak
about these Jews...

27:40.618 --> 27:44.622
sounds like they excite
your little penis.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.208
Maybe that's why
you never kill them

27:47.249 --> 27:50.252
when you have the chance,
American.

That's your brother's.

It was so cute.

an airborne contagion.

It's a pathogen.

30:17.566 --> 30:18.776

30:56.897 --> 30:58.857
Yeah, but the city

it was the last ship in

It is a food conglomerate

I pulled everything

31:55.539 --> 31:56.832

31:56.874 --> 31:59.627
Rocket Man is Wernher von Braun.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.962
He's a Nazi rocket scientist.

32:02.004 --> 32:03.547
He was a genius

32:03.589 --> 32:05.466
and my golden goose.

32:05.507 --> 32:08.093
He used thousands
of Jewish slaves

32:08.135 --> 32:10.095
to build the V-2 rockets
for Germany.

32:10.137 --> 32:12.264
Those rockets killed thousands
in Britain,

32:12.306 --> 32:16.060
and 20,000 camp prisoners died
in his factory.

32:16.101 --> 32:19.313
Soon as the war was over,
he was recruited by NASA.

32:19.355 --> 32:21.982
His work on Saturn V
begat the Apollo 11 mission,

32:22.024 --> 32:24.485
which propelled the U.S.
to the Moon.

Moonman was more beloved than,

40:08.365 --> 40:10.367
Let's go.

40:14.454 --> 40:17.332
Schidler Corp. 5623

40:17.374 --> 40:20.168
West Fifth...
That's what the file says.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.670
Million-dollar corporation
operates

40:21.711 --> 40:25.006
out of a fucking
bunion boutique?

40:37.978 --> 40:39.896
What'd Joe do,
hire a Coldwell Banker lady

40:39.938 --> 40:41.481
for an open house
at von Braun's?

40:41.523 --> 40:43.066
Let's go already.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.318
He needs to scope it out first.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.571
He'll be back soon enough.

40:49.906 --> 40:51.950
You stole from him,
from Wiesenthal.

40:51.992 --> 40:54.703
Files on The Wolf.
What'd you find in them?

40:54.744 --> 40:56.746
Not much.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.165
Your safta took the files.

40:58.206 --> 41:02.377
She wanted to learn more
about The Wolf.

41:02.419 --> 41:06.715
What Wiesenthal said
about her...

41:06.756 --> 41:09.676
I mean, it's bullshit, right?
It's-it's fucking bullshit.

41:09.718 --> 41:11.052
I'm not desecrating shit.

41:11.094 --> 41:13.305
- I'm fucking honoring her.
- Of course you are.

41:13.346 --> 41:14.723
What we're doing, it's...

41:14.764 --> 41:16.641
I mean, you said it.
You said it.

41:16.683 --> 41:19.394
It's... The Hunt is Jewish.

41:19.436 --> 41:21.354
And-and our forefathers
did it, too.

41:21.396 --> 41:23.440
They fought for their existence.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.983
They killed their enemies.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.735
They ended shit.

41:26.776 --> 41:29.446
Of course they did.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.868
How many people
did you kill that night?

41:42.459 --> 41:45.503
Eleven.

41:48.381 --> 41:51.009
Eleven men.

41:52.719 --> 41:55.639
Eleven innocent souls.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.934
In that moment, I made a choice.

41:58.975 --> 42:00.435
To protect the woman I love.

42:00.477 --> 42:03.647
And in doing that,

42:03.688 --> 42:06.691
I became a different creature.

42:08.526 --> 42:12.447
The Wolf had won,

42:12.489 --> 42:15.617
and I never saw
the sun rise again.

42:19.454 --> 42:21.456
It cost me my world.

42:23.500 --> 42:27.420
But it turned me toward the man

42:27.462 --> 42:29.714
I was destined to be.

42:29.756 --> 42:33.176
Now in darkness,

42:33.218 --> 42:35.512
I could protect the light.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.848
I became the night

42:38.890 --> 42:41.935
so that the day would live.

42:44.312 --> 42:47.482
That is the mark
of a hero, Jonah.

42:47.524 --> 42:50.568
Not the one who does
what is right,

42:50.610 --> 42:54.364
but the one who does...

42:54.406 --> 42:56.533
what is necessary.

43:07.294 --> 43:10.130
You sure you're gonna be okay
alone here, Ma?

43:10.171 --> 43:14.718
Yeah, darling, please, I'm fine.
You-you go.

43:14.759 --> 43:17.595
Don't forget to wear
that sweater.

43:17.637 --> 43:19.097
It's July, Ma.

43:19.139 --> 43:20.515
I know, but you know,

43:20.557 --> 43:23.560
they blast that air-conditioning
everywhere.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.145
Okay.

43:25.186 --> 43:27.939
You know Carol Smolinsky.

43:27.981 --> 43:30.692
She went into the movie
theater to see

43:30.734 --> 43:32.527
Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo.

43:32.569 --> 43:35.530
She left there with pneumonia.

43:35.572 --> 43:37.282
I'll wear the sweater, Ma.

43:37.324 --> 43:39.284
- Okay?
- Yeah.

43:39.326 --> 43:41.328
Good girl.

43:41.369 --> 43:44.539
You all right there?

43:44.581 --> 43:46.958
Yeah. Are you?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.376
- Oh, me?
- Yeah.

43:48.418 --> 43:50.670
I'm fine. Go, go, go.

43:53.423 --> 43:55.633
- Yeah.
- Okay.

43:58.345 --> 44:01.222
Hey, Ma. Love you.

44:16.196 --> 44:18.740
Well, you know,
Irene Schlosstein,

44:18.782 --> 44:22.077
she just could not
keep her mouth shut.

44:22.118 --> 44:24.371
And the waterworks.
It was like

44:24.412 --> 44:27.624
it was her husband's shiva.

44:27.665 --> 44:32.504
That Hymie Herschel, he-he
smelled up the whole apartment,

44:32.545 --> 44:36.257
of course, you know.

44:36.299 --> 44:41.179
And the insufferable
Eileen Shekenstein came,

44:41.221 --> 44:43.556
but you know,

44:43.598 --> 44:46.893
she-she gave me a nice hello,

44:46.935 --> 44:49.312
and that-that counts
for something.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.398
Yeah, it sure does.

44:51.439 --> 44:54.859
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:54.901 --> 44:57.237
- Oh, the rabbi...
- Oh.

44:57.278 --> 44:59.280
No, no, tell me
all about the rabbi. What?

44:59.322 --> 45:01.449
Well, he gave
a beautiful service.

45:01.491 --> 45:02.635
Yeah, you know what
the only perk is

45:02.659 --> 45:04.035
about being blown up to bits?

45:04.077 --> 45:05.412
I didn't have
to sit through that.

45:05.453 --> 45:08.498
Oh, please. You're just
such a wise-ass.

45:08.540 --> 45:11.960
Yes, well, some things,
Mindeleh, are eternal.

45:16.840 --> 45:21.136
Who is going to fix
that leak in the sink?

45:21.177 --> 45:23.847
You'll get a handyman.

45:23.888 --> 45:27.892
And who's going to change
the light bulbs?

45:27.934 --> 45:30.854
You'll ask the boys.

45:35.942 --> 45:38.611
Who is going...

45:38.653 --> 45:41.781
to put his arm
around me at night?

45:41.823 --> 45:46.327
Who is going to groan when
I pass a little gas,

45:46.369 --> 45:50.915
and rub my bunions and...

45:50.957 --> 45:55.420
Who is going to know
the stories, you know,

45:55.462 --> 45:58.840
that gave me these wrinkles?

45:58.882 --> 46:01.342
Who's going to watch over me?

46:01.384 --> 46:04.095
I will.

46:04.137 --> 46:05.555
I always will.

46:11.269 --> 46:13.104
Are you with him?

46:13.146 --> 46:14.898
I am.

46:17.400 --> 46:18.985
How does he look?

46:19.027 --> 46:20.653
Just as you remember him.

46:20.695 --> 46:22.697
Yeah?

46:24.782 --> 46:27.035
- Is he safe?
- Safe.

46:27.076 --> 46:29.871
- Is he happy?
- Oh, he's happy.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.293
Is he him?

46:37.212 --> 46:39.214
He's him.

46:47.222 --> 46:51.476
Does he forgive us
for what happened?

46:51.518 --> 46:54.187
And for living on...

46:54.229 --> 46:56.231
without him?

46:57.357 --> 46:59.526
Yeah, he does.

46:59.567 --> 47:01.569
But he misses you.

47:02.570 --> 47:04.531
He misses you.

47:04.572 --> 47:07.617
- He misses your scent.
- Ah.

47:07.659 --> 47:09.702
He misses your rugelach.

47:09.744 --> 47:11.788
And he misses the way

47:11.829 --> 47:14.040
you used to kiss him,

47:14.082 --> 47:16.793
even though he was pretending
to be sleeping.

47:19.462 --> 47:23.007
Mm. Would you like to see him?

47:25.051 --> 47:26.302
Murray.

47:26.344 --> 47:27.554
Yeah. Come.

47:27.595 --> 47:29.222
- Murray. Murray!
- Come, come.

47:29.264 --> 47:31.891
- I-I see him?
- Come.

47:39.357 --> 47:41.317
Where is he?

47:41.359 --> 47:43.361
- You'll see.
- Oh.

48:01.004 --> 48:03.047
Aaron?

48:03.089 --> 48:04.632
- Come.
- Ah.

48:04.674 --> 48:06.551
Aaron. Oh.

48:06.593 --> 48:09.971
Ketzeleh. Ketzeleh.

48:10.013 --> 48:13.016
Oh. Oh.

48:15.935 --> 48:18.062
Oh.

48:18.104 --> 48:20.106
I missed you, Mama.

48:20.148 --> 48:22.108
Oh.

48:22.150 --> 48:24.152
My boy,

48:24.193 --> 48:27.113
I missed you.

48:27.155 --> 48:29.949
Oh.

48:29.991 --> 48:33.411
Did you do all this?

48:33.453 --> 48:36.873
So that when you and Tata came,
you'd feel at home.

48:36.914 --> 48:40.043
It's beautiful.

48:40.084 --> 48:42.295
Oh, it's so beautiful.

48:42.337 --> 48:44.881
Do you want
to make something, Mama?

48:44.922 --> 48:46.883
Oh.

48:46.924 --> 48:49.260
I'd rather not dare.

48:49.302 --> 48:53.097
Whatever I make...
It will not compare,

48:53.139 --> 48:55.099
because many years ago,

48:55.141 --> 49:00.647
I already made the most
beautiful thing of all.

49:05.735 --> 49:10.073
Mindeleh, it's time to go now.

49:10.114 --> 49:12.200
Yes. Say yes.

49:12.241 --> 49:14.202
Before it's too late.

49:14.243 --> 49:18.164
Mindy, it's not time
for you to stay here with us.

49:18.206 --> 49:20.458
- Not yet.
- Mm.

49:20.500 --> 49:22.502
Aaron.

49:22.543 --> 49:26.255
Aaron, you say goodbye
to your mama.

49:26.297 --> 49:28.257
Yeah.

49:33.638 --> 49:35.473
- Yeah.
- Time.

49:35.515 --> 49:37.850
Come.

49:37.892 --> 49:40.186
Hey, Aaron, Aaron?

49:41.979 --> 49:44.357
Go.

49:44.399 --> 49:46.150
Come.

49:46.192 --> 49:47.610
Ooh.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.991
Yeah? Come.

49:56.119 --> 49:59.706
You don't have
to worry about him.

49:59.747 --> 50:03.000
I will take care of him,
I will never let him go.

50:05.002 --> 50:07.004
I know that.

50:08.172 --> 50:10.383
You-you never did.

50:12.969 --> 50:15.638
And he will take care of you

50:15.680 --> 50:19.892
for a time
until I see you again.

50:19.934 --> 50:21.936
Yeah.

50:31.988 --> 50:33.948
One last thing.

50:33.990 --> 50:36.576
Aaron asked

50:36.617 --> 50:40.913
that you show to Moritz mercy.

50:40.955 --> 50:43.499
That is his wish.

50:57.430 --> 51:01.809
You have a guardian angel,
Moritz.

51:01.851 --> 51:05.438
An angel, I say.

51:05.480 --> 51:07.231
Yeah.

51:07.273 --> 51:10.026
- Huh.
- You-you deserved

51:10.067 --> 51:12.403
so much worse.

How are you?

52:44.328 --> 52:48.499
Can you imagine
our eyes seeing you?

52:48.541 --> 52:50.167
You are a ghost.

52:50.209 --> 52:51.919
I don't want any trouble.

52:51.961 --> 52:55.756
Give Rocket Man a chair
to sit in.

53:06.392 --> 53:08.352
So, Wernher,

53:08.394 --> 53:11.439
do you really believe

53:11.480 --> 53:15.318
that landing
on the moon was worth

53:15.359 --> 53:20.197
the lives of millions of people?

53:22.199 --> 53:25.953
The science...
that I created led

53:25.995 --> 53:28.331
to great inventions,

53:28.372 --> 53:30.791
led to medical innovation,

53:30.833 --> 53:33.169
to longer lives,

53:33.210 --> 53:35.963
to peace around the world.

53:36.005 --> 53:39.175
My work always was one
for peace... and progress.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.760
Shut the fuck up!

53:40.801 --> 53:42.762
Hey, enough. Enough.

53:42.803 --> 53:45.056
Listen,
we've heard it all before.

53:45.097 --> 53:46.390
"I didn't know
what I was doing."

53:46.432 --> 53:47.642
"I was just
following orders."

53:47.683 --> 53:49.060
"I'm sorry for what I did."

53:49.101 --> 53:50.821
"I thought we were building
a better world."

53:50.853 --> 53:52.605
We've heard 'em all.
All the reasons.

53:52.647 --> 53:54.607
All the excuses.

53:54.649 --> 53:57.568
You did horrible fucking things.

53:57.610 --> 53:59.779
You enslaved hundreds of people.

53:59.820 --> 54:02.114
You killed thousands
with your weapons.

54:03.866 --> 54:05.576
Then you come
to the United States.

54:05.618 --> 54:07.578
You live a life of celebrity,

54:07.620 --> 54:10.873
sipping mai tais, gargling
Walt Disney's Jew-hating balls.

54:10.915 --> 54:12.917
We don't need another excuse.

54:12.959 --> 54:14.835
We don't need
another fucking lie.

54:14.877 --> 54:18.255
We are spent.

54:20.257 --> 54:21.884
Now you're gonna
skip the bullshit,

54:21.926 --> 54:23.636
and you're gonna
give us an answer.

54:23.678 --> 54:25.638
What do you know
about the Fourth Reich?

54:26.973 --> 54:29.517
- The what?
- The what? The what?

54:29.558 --> 54:31.078
The Fourth Reich.
What do you know about it?

54:31.102 --> 54:32.704
What do you know
about the fucking Fourth Reich?

54:32.728 --> 54:35.314
I don't understand.

54:35.356 --> 54:37.149
Don't play fucking stupid.
What do you know

54:37.191 --> 54:38.591
- about the Fourth Reich?
- I swear!

54:42.279 --> 54:44.782
I swear.

55:03.300 --> 55:05.553
So Schidler Corp.'s been
in the news

55:05.594 --> 55:07.388
on this South American
trade bill.

55:07.430 --> 55:09.432
Was a guy named Biff Simpson
behind it,

55:09.473 --> 55:11.434
the Under Secretary of State.

55:11.475 --> 55:13.644
And wouldn't you know,
he's on the fucking lam,

55:13.686 --> 55:16.272
chief suspect
in a double homicide.

55:16.313 --> 55:19.025
That guy whose family
was murdered at that barbecue?

55:19.066 --> 55:21.027
Everyone but him,
and not only that.

55:21.068 --> 55:23.070
There was a woman killed,
a Helen Kirsch.

55:23.112 --> 55:25.948
She's a survivor
of the Nazi death camps.

55:25.990 --> 55:28.993
So where's Biff Simpson up here?

55:49.555 --> 55:51.724
Been a long time, friend-o.

55:59.482 --> 56:01.400
Now, Wernher.

56:01.442 --> 56:04.653
You need to tell us everything
you know.

56:07.364 --> 56:09.366
Or we're gonna light you up...

56:09.408 --> 56:12.244
brighter than the stars above.

56:15.372 --> 56:18.250
What is the Fourth Reich?

56:18.292 --> 56:20.753
I don't know.

56:26.592 --> 56:29.220
Hold it, Joe.

56:31.555 --> 56:34.016
Let the boy do it.

56:40.606 --> 56:42.608
It's for the light.

56:52.409 --> 56:54.411
Mm.

57:06.090 --> 57:08.425
What is the Fourth Reich?

57:08.467 --> 57:10.678
I said I don't know.

57:17.059 --> 57:19.019
Well, I don't believe you.

57:19.061 --> 57:21.063
Maybe this will help you
remember.

57:23.107 --> 57:25.192
You sure about that?

57:25.234 --> 57:27.153
Huh?

57:27.194 --> 57:29.780
- Hmm.
- What is the Fourth Reich?

57:29.822 --> 57:31.782
- I don't understand.
- What is the Fourth Reich?

57:31.824 --> 57:34.451
What is the Fourth Reich?

57:35.494 --> 57:37.329
No?

57:37.371 --> 57:41.458
Okay.

57:41.500 --> 57:45.421
What is... the Fourth Reich?

57:45.462 --> 57:47.715
Tell us what you know.

57:47.756 --> 57:49.550
Tell us

57:49.592 --> 57:51.635
- what you fucking know!
- Stop. Please. Please?

57:51.677 --> 57:54.763
I'll tell you!
I'll tell you.

58:02.479 --> 58:04.899
I didn't know the extent.

58:06.400 --> 58:09.361
I only joined
because she promised

58:09.403 --> 58:11.322
there would be no money issues.

58:11.363 --> 58:15.159
The Fourth Reich would fund
projects the prudes at NASA

58:15.201 --> 58:19.496
never would dare... Mars,
distant galaxies, black holes.

58:19.538 --> 58:23.459
She said that if I helped her
take the world,

58:23.500 --> 58:25.586
I could rule the stars.

58:25.628 --> 58:28.297
She?

58:28.339 --> 58:30.299
"The Colonel."

58:30.341 --> 58:31.967
The Colonel?

58:32.009 --> 58:33.928
I-I don't know her real name.

58:33.969 --> 58:36.430
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

58:36.472 --> 58:38.432
I just...

58:38.474 --> 58:42.269
I wanted the moon.

58:42.311 --> 58:44.647
I wanted the stars.

58:44.688 --> 58:47.524
So...

58:47.566 --> 58:49.693
I helped them...

58:49.735 --> 58:51.695
create it.

58:51.737 --> 58:54.365
The Solution.

58:54.406 --> 58:57.159
Wait. The pathogen.
The pathogen, right?

58:57.201 --> 58:59.370
Where is it being released?

58:59.411 --> 59:01.372
Where are they fucking
releasing it?!

59:01.413 --> 59:03.165
Everywhere.

59:03.207 --> 59:06.001
It's in everything.

59:06.043 --> 59:09.505
It's in food and drink,
medicines.

59:09.546 --> 59:11.924
It's a new creation.

59:11.966 --> 59:15.261
It's a new weapon.

59:15.302 --> 59:17.388
A food substitute soon

59:17.429 --> 59:22.059
to be on every shelf in America.

59:22.101 --> 59:24.520
Targeting the inner cities.

59:24.561 --> 59:28.732
Glucopyranose monohydrate.

59:29.775 --> 59:32.319
Corn syrup.

59:34.989 --> 59:37.157
Corn syrup.

59:38.534 --> 59:40.577
Corn syrup.

59:45.874 --> 59:48.002
Like that? You like that?

59:48.043 --> 59:49.980
- What are you doing?
- Tell us what you fucking know...
He's lying.

59:50.004 --> 59:52.023
-Tell us what you know.
Tell us everything.
-Swear...

59:52.047 --> 59:54.341
- I swear!
- Everything that you know!

59:54.383 --> 59:55.694
- Tell us! Come on. Tell us.
- I swear.

59:55.718 --> 59:56.969
Jonah, that's enough.

59:59.513 --> 1:00:01.181
Tell us. Come on.

1:00:01.223 --> 1:00:03.309
Meyer.

1:00:03.350 --> 1:00:05.686
Enough, Jonah.
Meyer, make him stop.

1:00:05.728 --> 1:00:06.979
We got what we needed.

1:00:07.021 --> 1:00:08.665
He's not, he's not fucking
telling us the truth.

1:00:08.689 --> 1:00:10.566
Come on. We'll fucking cook you.

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:12.192
You don't want to speak? Huh?

1:00:12.234 --> 1:00:13.819
No? Okay.

1:00:13.861 --> 1:00:15.279
Meyer, make him stop!

1:00:15.321 --> 1:00:16.613
Cut it.

1:00:21.910 --> 1:00:23.954
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1:00:23.996 --> 1:00:26.790
- Why? What'd I do?
- Get back to the car.

1:00:26.832 --> 1:00:28.250
Now!

1:00:42.931 --> 1:00:44.558
Mercy.

1:00:46.977 --> 1:00:48.312
Mercy.

1:00:49.938 --> 1:00:50.981
Mercy.

1:01:09.583 --> 1:01:11.377
No.

1:01:11.418 --> 1:01:13.295
No.

1:01:13.337 --> 1:01:16.673
No. No!

1:01:16.715 --> 1:01:17.883
No!

1:01:50.916 --> 1:01:52.709
Do you like sugar?

1:01:52.751 --> 1:01:54.169
Do you like sweets?

1:01:54.211 --> 1:01:57.047
Do you like yummy, tasty treats?

1:01:57.089 --> 1:02:00.634
Then get ready for corn syrup.

1:02:00.676 --> 1:02:02.803
Mama, what's corn syrup?

1:02:02.845 --> 1:02:04.638
What's corn syrup, you ask?

1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:07.182
It's a new substitute for sugar.

1:02:07.224 --> 1:02:09.601
A substitute
that is cheaper, healthier

1:02:09.643 --> 1:02:13.689
and most importantly, sweeter
than your wildest dreams.

1:02:13.730 --> 1:02:15.107
Americans foolish.

1:02:15.149 --> 1:02:18.152
The junk food rots
your teeth, man.

1:02:18.193 --> 1:02:19.903
Why did we move
to this silly country?

1:02:19.945 --> 1:02:21.655
Back on an ocean.
