WEBVTT

00:46.755 --> 00:48.923
-Sir, you can't go up there.
- Step aside.

00:57.974 --> 01:00.560
- Capillaries burst.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.562
The guy's stack is swimming in blood.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.398
What the fuck?

01:06.316 --> 01:09.402
Hold... hold on. Hold it!
This is an active crime scene.

01:09.486 --> 01:13.406
Detective Lorcan, Colonel Carrera,
Protector of Special Forces.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.867
We intercepted your initial report.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.912
My unit will take over this investigation.

01:18.995 --> 01:19.996
On what grounds?

01:20.497 --> 01:22.791
I mean, this is a civilian murder case.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.459
You're the Wedge.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.923
If it were up to me, I'd stay out
of your way, but I've got orders. So, um,

01:30.381 --> 01:33.051
why not show me the tank,
and we can get this over with.

01:33.551 --> 01:34.552
Fine.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.097
But no weapons.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.267
You heard the man.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.546
Looks like your suspect
had a hard time re-sleeving.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.965
You download the transfer data?

02:12.382 --> 02:14.092
We're not amateurs, Colonel.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.722
Based on our estimated timeline,
whoever cast in

02:19.806 --> 02:22.142
showed up just before the killing started.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.564
Any weapons recovered on site?

02:28.022 --> 02:32.026
Nothing that wasn't registered
to Axley or his security.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.238
What about your team?

02:36.406 --> 02:38.533
They know what happened
to Axley's backups?

02:38.616 --> 02:40.994
I don't keep secrets from my team.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.412
Mm-hmm.

02:45.790 --> 02:46.749
So...

02:47.667 --> 02:50.003
who do you think cast into the sleeve,
Detective?

02:50.503 --> 02:53.464
You were first on the scene.
I'm sure you have some insight.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.591
Ah.

02:55.592 --> 02:59.512
Well, judging from the organic damage,
I'm thinking military.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.183
Some PTSD headcase fragged from the war.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.935
Or one too many skulljumps.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.354
You've a low opinion of those who serve.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.023
It's just a theory.

03:10.398 --> 03:13.526
Rich guys like Axley like to hire vets
as bodyguards.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.070
I take it
you've never been in the military?

03:16.154 --> 03:17.864
What? And risk my stack?

03:18.281 --> 03:20.575
So Danica Harlan
can make an extra two percent

03:20.658 --> 03:22.785
pushing alloy past Kemp's blockades?

03:23.620 --> 03:27.373
The, uh, sleeve our perp cast into,
now that thing is a freak show.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.713
That's mil-spec.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.506
Unregistered.

03:35.590 --> 03:36.424
Well...

03:37.425 --> 03:41.179
whoever designed it
was into some fucked up gene splicing.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.181
They cut in canine DNA.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.475
The killer's part dog.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.435
You sure it wasn't wolf?

03:47.518 --> 03:49.687
Wolf? Dog? What's the difference?

03:50.271 --> 03:51.940
Start messing with your genome like that,

03:52.023 --> 03:54.359
next thing you know,
you got a snout and four legs.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.071
Guess Axley should've used
a shorter leash.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.908
You know what, Detective?

04:02.408 --> 04:03.493
I've seen enough.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.750
So, Colonel...

04:12.961 --> 04:14.212
what are you thinking?

04:15.880 --> 04:17.757
Here is my considered opinion.

04:19.384 --> 04:23.054
If you kick a dog, it'll crawl back,
lick your foot,

04:24.013 --> 04:25.473
begging for forgiveness.

05:15.815 --> 05:16.858
Kick a wolf...

05:25.366 --> 05:26.868
and he'll rip your face off.

05:37.962 --> 05:38.838
Pack up.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.140
Are we having a fete?

05:50.224 --> 05:54.312
More of a wake, but still a toast.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.648
Here's to 30 years...

06:00.068 --> 06:02.153
42 planets...

06:05.323 --> 06:06.949
countless sleeves...

06:10.161 --> 06:11.996
and I don't know how many credits.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.209
Fifty-one million
three hundred thirty-two thousand.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.090
After all that, I get five words:

06:22.673 --> 06:23.841
"I'm not here for you."

06:23.925 --> 06:27.095
Well, technically speaking,
Miss Falconer was not there for you.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.888
She was there to kill Mr. Axley.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.016
And I'm just a naked stranger
who got in the way?

06:32.850 --> 06:35.019
Could explain the extreme violence.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.855
Yeah, but it doesn't explain
why she was there to begin with,

06:37.939 --> 06:39.607
or how Axley knew she was coming.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.152
May I suggest temperance?

06:43.236 --> 06:46.614
Your sorrows may be infinite,
but the supply of whiskey is not.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.866
And just as well.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.578
This sleeve seems to have
some metabolic filter.

06:53.162 --> 06:55.665
Run a scan and see
what other modifications Axley made.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.251
I'm sick of surprises.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.087
A full analysis will take quite some time.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.297
What, pray tell, is your plan?

07:04.006 --> 07:06.634
Drink fast enough to try and override
the tolerance settings.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.139
I meant your plan to locate Miss Falconer.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.517
She doesn't wanna be found.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.311
At least not by me.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.564
As dispiriting as this may be,

07:19.647 --> 07:21.524
perhaps you should consider
the alternative.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.610
That the woman you crossed
is not, in fact, her.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.155
-That someone else is riding her sleeve.
-Yeah, but...

07:27.864 --> 07:31.409
on Harlan's World,
it's illegal to replicate her sleeve.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.827
-Mm-hmm.
-Why risk it?

07:34.287 --> 07:35.246
Fear.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.082
A murderer terrorizing Axley.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.169
Hmm? Becoming a ghost of retribution.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.837
I wasn't acclimated.

07:43.379 --> 07:46.424
She could have killed me
just like everyone else, but she didn't.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.843
It doesn't make sense unless...

07:57.059 --> 07:58.311
...she knew me.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.484
The only way to know for sure
is to find Miss Falconer.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.987
Or the dastardly sleeve-jacker
who's inhabiting her form.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.655
Axley knew something.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.868
Hack the police files.
See if he's reappeared.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.872
According to the report,
Mr. Axley suffered organic damage

08:17.955 --> 08:19.957
and is recuperating on Latimer
in a new clone.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.877
Well, that leaves me nowhere.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.882
Hmm, if only you knew someone
who worked for Mr. Axley.

08:30.301 --> 08:34.805
Someone who could provide insight
into his affairs.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.392
What do you mean, the bounty hunter?
The one who shot me in the back?

08:38.476 --> 08:40.603
In her defense, she is hardly the first.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.232
Yeah, but I don't even know her name.
I can't just go around asking.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.491
Pull up all open bounties on planet.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.662
Everyone who has a price on their head.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.752
Last time we were here was less than 100.

09:04.835 --> 09:08.881
Most of these are civilians, refugees,
some soldiers who've gone missing.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.218
Lost souls, if you will.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.303
Narrow it down.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.972
Violent offenders only.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.058
Isolate the subjects
with the highest reward.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.185
Axley's assets have been frozen,

09:21.269 --> 09:25.940
so my guess is our little bounty hunter
is gonna try and make up those credits.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.858
Credits...

09:35.241 --> 09:36.075
No!

09:38.869 --> 09:40.037
My apologies.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.874
There seems to be some disruptions
in my neural net.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.209
It's more than that.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.003
Your processor is corrupted.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.839
It has been since Leung attacked
in Bay City.

09:49.922 --> 09:50.840
Quite aware.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.425
It's getting worse.

09:53.467 --> 09:54.552
You need to reboot.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.053
It's not that simple.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.307
I'd have to completely shut down.
There's no telling how long I'd be out.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.183
A day, a week, a month?

10:01.726 --> 10:04.729
You cannot be without backup
in this crucial time!

10:04.812 --> 10:05.980
It's not about me!

10:06.063 --> 10:07.189
It's about her.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.609
You're afraid your gonna forget Lizzie.

10:10.067 --> 10:10.943
It is...

10:13.487 --> 10:17.992
It is quite possible that in rebuilding
my operating system, my...

10:19.535 --> 10:21.787
recollections of Miss Elizabeth...

10:24.165 --> 10:25.374
would be wiped clean.

10:26.917 --> 10:32.840
All my recollections of you
and our wild-goose chase across the stars.

10:33.507 --> 10:38.095
All the sum total of all my experiences.

10:38.179 --> 10:42.767
Surely you can understand my reluctance.

10:43.809 --> 10:47.146
I can't rely on you if you keep glitching.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.398
You have to let go.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.109
Like you've let go of Miss Falconer?

10:53.986 --> 10:55.821
You're putting us both at risk.

10:55.905 --> 10:59.575
I reboot, there won't be a me
to risk losing.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.122
So...

11:06.374 --> 11:09.752
if you will allow me to perform
a manual override...

11:10.878 --> 11:12.713
I believe this is what you're looking for.

11:13.297 --> 11:16.592
Highest bounties on planet
are these five unsavory characters.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.554
Upload them to my ONI.

11:21.389 --> 11:24.433
And when you've finished the scan
of my sleeve, let me know what you find.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.601
Mm-hmm.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.062
This isn't over.

11:28.145 --> 11:29.480
Oh, I assure you.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.190
Measures will be taken.

11:31.899 --> 11:32.733
Good.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.360
In the meantime...

11:36.153 --> 11:37.613
I'm going bounty-hunting.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.955
The first alloy shipments
went out on schedule.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.040
No disturbance from Kemp or his rebels.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.375
And the Protectorate?

11:49.458 --> 11:52.837
Already demanding we double
our protection as expected.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.047
We'll cross that bridge when we have to.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.216
As far as the mines are concerned...

12:00.302 --> 12:01.637
Colonel Carrera.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.681
This is a surprise.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.561
I thought you'd be gone by now.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.771
I told you the ceasefire
wouldn't hold, Governor.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.314
Looks like I was right.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.442
I have no idea what the hell
you're talking about.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.402
Horace Axley does.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.156
Unfortunately, he's not here to elaborate.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.449
That's because he's dead.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.910
An intruder cast into his home last night
and killed him.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.538
That is alarming.
Then again, it's no secret

12:27.621 --> 12:30.332
that Axley
has his fair share of enemies.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.294
We'll ask him which one it was
when he spins back up.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.045
He's not spinning back up.

12:35.504 --> 12:39.925
His stack was wiped completely
along with all of his remote backups.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.762
-Axley was real-deathed.
-That's not possible.

12:42.845 --> 12:46.390
The Quellists are a terrorist death cult.

12:46.932 --> 12:51.729
They've wanted to curtail the human
life span since the days of Falconer.

12:51.812 --> 12:54.482
Whatever weapon was used to kill Axley,

12:54.565 --> 12:57.026
I'm sure their fingerprints
are all over it.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.360
We cannot let this get out.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.654
-If people think we're vulnerable--
-Don't worry.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.073
I locked it all the way down.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.659
Scrubbed their reports,
took care of the witnesses.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.121
Your reputations are safe.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.873
But they are not my concern.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.416
What is your concern?

13:13.334 --> 13:15.669
You have no proof
the Quellists are involved.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.923
You were sent here
to manage the war effort.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.759
And as much as you'd like
to find a reason to stay,

13:21.842 --> 13:24.261
a Meth's murder is my jurisdiction.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.387
You're wrong, Governor.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.602
The killer's DHF was downloaded
into a Wedge sleeve,

13:32.061 --> 13:35.231
a model designed exclusively for me
and my team.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.567
The stolen Protectorate asset
of that magnitude

13:38.651 --> 13:40.611
makes it my jurisdiction.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.988
I am here until it's recovered.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.907
Well, that shouldn't take long.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.952
We all know how the Protectorate
loves to tag their toys.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.912
We can track the sleeve's biometrics.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.622
By all means, track away.

13:52.915 --> 13:56.377
But I have no doubt you'll find
whoever did this was acting alone.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.381
The people of Harlan's World
are committed to peace.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.802
It's foolish to think you can make peace
with terrorists.

14:05.302 --> 14:08.138
You should have crushed the Quellists
instead of cowing to them.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.474
Your father understood that.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.268
I am not my father.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.936
And we're all worse off for that.

14:15.312 --> 14:19.900
Find the Meth killer, Colonel.
And then get the fuck off my planet.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.280
It's the Protectorate's planet, Governor.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.324
They all are.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.757
Ho, Gertie.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.803
Got a question.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.054
No questions.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.141
-Come on, G.
-You wanna know who I buy from.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.434
I buy from everyone.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.774
You are moving a lot of gear.

15:00.858 --> 15:04.194
Hey, watch it. I don't want those coils
of yours setting off my machinery.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.616
You seen Raab lately?

15:09.325 --> 15:10.492
Uh, no.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.744
Why do you ask?

15:12.411 --> 15:14.914
'Cause he usually comes in
after a hack-and-grab.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.708
-Emphasis on the hack.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.044
-No, no, I haven't seen him, no.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.589
I've been looking for you.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.843
You shoot me twice in two days,

15:28.344 --> 15:29.637
I will hold a grudge.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.556
Kovacs?

15:33.182 --> 15:34.475
You catch on fast.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.479
Who are you waiting for? Raab?

15:38.562 --> 15:39.980
What the hell do you know about it?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.238
I got something for ya.

15:50.991 --> 15:53.410
Do me a favor,
stay the hell out of my way.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.418
That still have scalp on it?

16:05.339 --> 16:06.173
Trepp.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.716
Been a while.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.677
You broke the code, Raab.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.429
So you got a partner now?

16:13.305 --> 16:15.599
You're supposed to salvage war wreckage,

16:16.100 --> 16:17.935
not other Decoms in the field.

16:19.186 --> 16:22.398
The Guild is offering lots of zeros
to haul your ass in.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.983
Got a preference?

16:24.066 --> 16:25.317
Sleeve or stack?

16:25.651 --> 16:26.986
I suggest sleeve.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.196
How much to walk away now?

16:30.406 --> 16:31.699
That...

16:32.533 --> 16:33.826
is not yours.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.203
Maybe not.

16:37.913 --> 16:41.667
But then again,
maybe I'll take your coils.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.878
Make you mine.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.757
I'm not joking.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.092
I'm not her partner.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.972
Goddammit, Kovacs.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.659
Relax. I'm just gonna take a little
off the top.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.204
Hey!

17:25.169 --> 17:27.671
Wait, I choose sleeve.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.799
-No. Deal's off the table.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.637
You good?

17:36.013 --> 17:39.349
You show up just to fuck
with my income stream or what?

17:41.810 --> 17:43.270
Who's gonna pay for all this?

17:43.604 --> 17:45.439
Take their gear. Keep the change.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.778
What the hell was that?

17:51.153 --> 17:54.073
-Raab's stack was my bounty.
-Yeah, speaking of bounties,

17:54.156 --> 17:56.867
here are the five highest-valued bounties
on the board.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.829
Bullshit, you went through all five
just to find me?

18:00.913 --> 18:02.289
Process of elimination.

18:02.372 --> 18:03.749
So what's it gonna be?

18:04.249 --> 18:05.167
Are we gonna talk?

18:05.250 --> 18:08.212
Or am I dropping a fistful of scumbags
down the drain?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.757
Shit. Not here.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.217
Let's go.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.472
This is dangerous territory, Danica.

18:19.014 --> 18:21.517
News of Axley's murder
will find its way out.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.894
-And I don't have to tell you--
-You're right, Dugan.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.229
You don't.

18:25.312 --> 18:28.315
There's nothing to be gained
about disseminating this information.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.400
Or by undermining me.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.277
I'm trying to help you.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.073
Your father relied on me
to tell him the truth.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.034
If Carrera's determined
to stay on this planet,

18:39.118 --> 18:40.911
he's just gonna find another excuse.

18:40.994 --> 18:41.954
Then we wait...

18:42.621 --> 18:44.331
till he runs out of excuses.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.333
You're being reckless!

18:47.751 --> 18:50.003
A weapon that can erase remote backups.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.799
Do you understand what could happen

18:53.882 --> 18:55.884
if the Protectorate adds that
to their arsenal?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.470
Your generation doesn't remember
what it was like before stacks.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.597
-Don't.
-The decisions we had to make.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.851
Do not lecture me on consequences.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.729
This isn't about proving yourself, Danica.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.357
Your father knew how to keep
the Protectorate in check.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.443
If you would just consider contacting him.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.783
You wanna contact Konrad?

19:20.576 --> 19:21.952
Go ahead, ONI him.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.038
You've already tried.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.749
We all have.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.921
Since he took his Renouncer vows,
no one can reach him.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.049
He's gone.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.928
I still can't understand it.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.806
He gave up everything so suddenly.

19:45.893 --> 19:49.938
As his oldest friend, I can imagine
your disappointment in his decision.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.568
But I'm his only child.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.905
You can't imagine mine.

19:58.614 --> 19:59.489
You're right.

20:00.616 --> 20:01.617
I'll go.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.911
Dugan.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.541
Carrera is on our planet.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.753
The situation is volatile.

20:13.629 --> 20:16.465
If something were to happen
after he secures the weapon...

20:18.508 --> 20:20.260
who's to say who it belongs to?

20:21.637 --> 20:23.055
What you're talking about,

20:23.847 --> 20:27.309
it would shift the balance of power
throughout the settled worlds.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.313
My father's not the only Harlan
capable of making history.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.066
Give me time.

20:47.287 --> 20:50.540
Look, Axley and I weren't exactly friends.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.211
-I did a few jobs for him. That's all.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.340
He kept his hands to himself.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.300
Paid his bills on time.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.469
Well, until now.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.805
You aren't worried that I killed him?

21:05.806 --> 21:06.640
Didn't add up.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.060
Axley told me he wanted you
for protection.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.397
-Any idea from who?
-No.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.441
But he must have done something
to piss someone off.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.488
So what did he say when he hired you?

21:21.989 --> 21:24.449
That he wanted the Last Envoy.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.577
No accounting for taste, I guess.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.788
And you didn't ask any questions?

21:31.957 --> 21:35.085
Why would I?
The man was offering to double my rate.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.337
What's it to you anyway?

21:37.921 --> 21:41.508
When I found you, you were singing
torch songs on Maghda Prime.

21:41.842 --> 21:45.220
Why not just cash in
that fancy sleeve of yours and cast off?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.642
No one stays on Harlan's without a reason.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.185
What's yours?

21:54.604 --> 21:56.648
I said no interruptions.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.902
Too bad. Crowd out there's thirsty.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.489
And they're actually paying.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.044
Oh, shit. There's trouble in paradise.

22:20.047 --> 22:23.550
Is that the famous Envoy intuition
I've heard so much about?

22:24.259 --> 22:25.427
'Cause you're way off.

22:26.845 --> 22:27.679
Look...

22:28.305 --> 22:29.681
when I showed up at Axley's,

22:29.765 --> 22:32.142
he was on his ONI
with his business partners.

22:32.225 --> 22:34.978
I overheard them talking about extortion.

22:35.479 --> 22:39.107
Said some blackmailer was gonna
catch hell for wearing an illegal sleeve.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.110
-Who did they say was blackmailing him?
-They didn't.

22:42.986 --> 22:45.655
But once he hung up, he called me in,

22:45.739 --> 22:48.075
told me I had to track you down
immediately.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.035
So Axley's partners, who are they?

22:55.374 --> 22:58.627
Anton Durov and Haruki Okada.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.713
-Where can I find 'em?
-I'm sure we can figure it out.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.924
-There is no we.
-Not yet.

23:04.007 --> 23:08.261
Listen, I have never seen anyone roll
five heavy hitters in one day.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.389
We partner up...

23:11.848 --> 23:13.183
we could set a new record.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.019
Split the payouts 50-50.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.105
I work alone.

23:20.482 --> 23:23.151
No resources and no contacts.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.319
Good luck.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.073
Thanks for the drink.

23:44.297 --> 23:47.300
Uh, bio-tracker, hmm.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.720
You cannot hide your secrets from me.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.391
Mr. Kovacs.

23:54.766 --> 23:57.060
Hmm, back from the hunt.

23:57.602 --> 23:58.854
Was your search fruitful?

23:58.937 --> 24:01.231
I found the bounty hunter,
if that's what you're asking.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.819
Judging by your demeanor,

24:06.778 --> 24:08.738
you uncovered more than you bargained for?

24:08.822 --> 24:10.699
I think you were right
about the sleeve-jacker.

24:11.741 --> 24:12.576
What's this?

24:13.076 --> 24:17.456
This is a new external
data retrieval system

24:17.539 --> 24:20.000
I installed to remedy my...

24:21.626 --> 24:23.962
-short-term memory loss. Hmm.
-You're kidding, right?

24:24.045 --> 24:26.590
If you actually look,
you'll see I performed a detailed scan

24:26.673 --> 24:28.175
of your sleeve as requested.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.093
And it appears there is, uh...

24:30.177 --> 24:32.846
There is transgenic splicing. Hmm?

24:32.929 --> 24:36.266
<i>Canis lupus.</i>

24:38.685 --> 24:41.104
And hyper mobility, hmm?

24:41.188 --> 24:45.150
-Subconscious survival skills--
-I'll read the footnotes later.

24:45.567 --> 24:50.071
Run a search on Axley's associates
Anton Durov and Haruki Okada.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.114
I need everything.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.366
Most importantly, where can I find them?

24:54.034 --> 24:57.913
But it's unlikely a pair of Meths
would post their calendar on the Array.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.499
Well, hack their personal
security systems.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.252
They know why Axley thought Quell
was on planet.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.921
Planet...

25:07.964 --> 25:08.798
Wait.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.761
Did you just say, uh...

25:14.095 --> 25:18.099
Did you just say Miss Falconer is here?

25:18.683 --> 25:19.601
On this planet?

25:19.684 --> 25:20.685
Are you serious?

25:20.769 --> 25:21.603
Uh...

25:23.021 --> 25:25.649
perhaps if you would explain--

25:25.732 --> 25:27.817
I don't have time to explain!

25:28.360 --> 25:29.611
Now you were supposed to reboot.

25:29.694 --> 25:33.365
-I cannot recall agreeing to that.
- You don't recall anything!

25:34.282 --> 25:36.076
That's what I've been saying.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.246
Now, screw your half-assed sticky notes!

25:39.913 --> 25:43.917
And screw whatever you're trying to hold
onto in that nanodust brain of yours.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.088
Now either you reboot or find someone else
to follow like a lost dog.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.424
Now do you think you can remember that?

25:53.593 --> 25:55.345
Those words will be hard to forget.

25:59.182 --> 26:00.100
Poe...

26:04.020 --> 26:05.522
you're gonna get me killed.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.736
May I ask where are you going?

26:37.345 --> 26:39.222
You don't look good Takeshi<i>-san.</i>

26:39.973 --> 26:41.182
It's been a long day.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.772
I found the Meths you're looking for.

26:48.231 --> 26:50.233
They're at the Soul Market.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.485
Soul Market?

26:52.986 --> 26:56.906
The war's left us with too many stacks
and not enough sleeves.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.700
They have to go somewhere.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.995
The man who owns it, Semetaire,

27:02.621 --> 27:06.916
has made good business out of ransoming
stacks back to families.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.586
Sounds charming.

27:10.587 --> 27:14.090
He also extracts digitized memories

27:14.174 --> 27:16.676
and repurposes them for...

27:17.260 --> 27:18.386
entertainment.

27:20.221 --> 27:23.975
Anton Durov and Haruki Okada
frequent his club.

27:25.393 --> 27:28.563
You can't walk in off the street.
You have to be on the list.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.523
So get me the hell on it.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.651
Don't give me commands, Takeshi.

27:34.402 --> 27:35.695
You haven't found her.

27:37.656 --> 27:38.823
I thought I had...

27:39.449 --> 27:40.492
for a minute.

27:42.619 --> 27:43.995
It's a sleeve-jacker.

27:44.954 --> 27:49.125
That's no excuse to take your misfortune
out on a friend.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.296
It seems to be what I'm best at.

27:56.716 --> 28:01.137
<i>Oyabun,</i> someone's walking around
in her skin.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.473
So you want to punish them?

28:04.099 --> 28:05.016
Punish them?

28:05.100 --> 28:07.644
I'd rather put a million bullets
in that sleeve

28:07.727 --> 28:09.437
than let an impostor defile it.

28:09.521 --> 28:13.191
And when that stack hits VR,
it's gonna be a million more deaths,

28:13.274 --> 28:14.567
far worse than that.

28:15.151 --> 28:16.945
You don't know, do you?

28:18.029 --> 28:19.280
There are rumors...

28:19.989 --> 28:25.120
whispers that it was more than
Axley's sleeve that was destroyed.

28:25.704 --> 28:29.833
That all of his DHF backups
were erased as well.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.753
- Be careful.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.507
These Meths may have answers you seek.

28:38.591 --> 28:42.679
But follow them
and the killer might turn on you.

28:44.931 --> 28:46.141
I hope they do.

28:47.392 --> 28:48.560
Save me some time.

28:49.894 --> 28:50.812
This is it.

28:53.231 --> 28:54.566
You're on the list.

28:55.608 --> 28:57.110
<i>Arigato, Oyabun.</i>

28:58.069 --> 28:59.612
As you set down this path,

28:59.696 --> 29:03.950
consider is your anger truly
with this impostor,

29:04.033 --> 29:05.702
or is it with yourself?

29:07.370 --> 29:09.539
There's more than enough to go around.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.041
So why choose?

29:30.018 --> 29:31.811
<i> Nothing is sacred.</i>

29:35.356 --> 29:37.233
<i>Every gift we've been given...</i>

29:41.780 --> 29:43.865
<i>every resource discovered...</i>

29:45.950 --> 29:49.662
<i>each new and shining thing</i>
<i>that catches our eye...</i>

29:51.915 --> 29:52.999
<i>we pollute...</i>

29:55.376 --> 29:56.669
<i>disrespect...</i>

29:58.087 --> 29:59.005
<i>violate.</i>

30:01.591 --> 30:03.968
<i>We tell ourselves this is progress.</i>

30:06.763 --> 30:09.766
<i>Selling each other the fruits</i>
<i>of our destruction.</i>

30:12.936 --> 30:15.980
<i>Sparing no thought to what we lose...</i>

30:19.359 --> 30:22.070
<i>or leave behind, churning in our wake.</i>

30:45.468 --> 30:46.845
You Semetaire?

30:46.928 --> 30:48.972
I am a simple ferryman,

30:49.389 --> 30:52.934
plucking souls from my ocean wide.

30:53.017 --> 30:56.896
Soldier, miner, sex worker, laborer.

30:57.438 --> 31:00.608
Ah, no one swims for long.

31:01.985 --> 31:04.445
Not with you stripping 'em
of their memories they don't.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.865
Their lives are worthless.

31:08.366 --> 31:11.786
Their experiences are not.

31:13.079 --> 31:15.582
So what if someone comes around
looking for 'em?

31:16.499 --> 31:17.917
Nobody's claiming them.

31:18.543 --> 31:22.171
But they can still bring pleasure to some.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.014
So...

31:32.056 --> 31:34.517
what pleasure do you seek?

31:39.772 --> 31:41.524
I'll have what they're having.

31:42.525 --> 31:43.860
I can accommodate you.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.112
Provided you are on the list.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.366
<i>Confirmed.</i>

31:50.450 --> 31:52.243
Ah, follow me.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.006
You really think
Quellists murdered that Meth?

32:06.132 --> 32:08.092
If it keeps us on planet, I do.

32:14.140 --> 32:16.059
Ever hear of Constantinople?

32:18.478 --> 32:19.312
The Earth city?

32:19.395 --> 32:22.106
It stood unconquered for over 1,000 years.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.609
The walls were impenetrable.

32:25.735 --> 32:30.073
Until one day, a small gate
was left unlocked during a siege.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.575
There was no sabotage, no traitor.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.787
A simple mistake
and the enemy poured through.

32:37.038 --> 32:40.291
All because the man with the key
fell down on the job.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.418
Governor Harlan is the man with the key.

32:42.502 --> 32:44.796
The man with the key is her father.

32:45.588 --> 32:48.299
He kept the Protectorate at bay
for centuries.

32:48.800 --> 32:53.262
Until one day, he abandoned his post
and left his daughter in charge.

32:55.181 --> 32:56.849
-She's the gate.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.393
We've got a hit on the sleeve.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.066
Gear up.

34:03.583 --> 34:04.500
Thank you.

34:12.508 --> 34:14.177
Holy shit.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.388
The way you screamed.

34:17.680 --> 34:18.514
Told ya.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.850
I forgot what real fear felt like.

34:20.933 --> 34:22.727
No rush quite like it, right?

34:23.561 --> 34:25.646
This is a private party, stranger.

34:26.522 --> 34:28.483
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.360
Seemed like your friend
could use a chaser.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.406
I'd share, but...

34:36.282 --> 34:37.200
Oh.

34:37.617 --> 34:40.119
Haruki, relax.

34:40.203 --> 34:44.332
Just a fellow mudraker
looking to feel alive.

34:47.835 --> 34:48.711
Sit.

34:50.088 --> 34:50.922
Please.

34:59.972 --> 35:04.310
On to a more divine plane then.

35:04.393 --> 35:06.020
-Absolutely.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.207
Someone's been busy.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.000
What?

35:28.417 --> 35:30.962
These are the top five gets on the planet.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.463
How did you swing that?

35:33.256 --> 35:35.675
Let's just say I was highly motivated
this evening.

35:36.592 --> 35:37.718
Are you cashing out?

35:39.554 --> 35:42.140
I don't know. Any hits on my guy?

35:43.015 --> 35:43.933
Let's see.

35:46.018 --> 35:46.936
No.

35:47.979 --> 35:48.896
Nothing new.

35:49.939 --> 35:53.234
All the missing people out there,
it's hard to stand out.

35:54.235 --> 35:55.361
You know the drill, Trepp.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.489
More credits, more hits.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.329
-Up it. Up the reward.
-How much?

36:06.622 --> 36:07.498
All of it.

36:07.582 --> 36:08.457
Are you sure?

36:11.961 --> 36:14.088
Some things are more important than money.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.895
Friend, I don't give a fuck who you are.

36:28.978 --> 36:31.731
This is the best shit I've had
in a century.

36:32.231 --> 36:34.525
-Hey, about earlier--
-Ah, don't worry about it.

36:34.609 --> 36:38.237
Everyone seems on edge since Axley
went and got himself killed yesterday.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.156
You know Horace?

36:40.781 --> 36:42.450
We met briefly.

36:42.533 --> 36:43.910
He's a wet blanket.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.454
Afraid of his own goddamn shadow.

36:46.537 --> 36:47.955
It seems like he had reason to be.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.166
Oh, you don't get it. He was losing it.

36:50.249 --> 36:52.627
Talking about the damn bogeyman.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.128
-About what?

36:55.379 --> 36:57.882
Quellcrist Falconer. She's back.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.300
Here to kill us all.

36:59.383 --> 37:01.135
What about Quellcrist Falconer?

37:01.219 --> 37:02.887
He obviously rode some doctored patch,

37:02.970 --> 37:04.805
but you're not gonna convince Horace
of that.

37:04.889 --> 37:08.684
Well, here's hoping he stays on Latimer
until he gets it out of his system.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.061
Oh, you got it wrong.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.605
My man Axley is not on Latimer.

37:13.648 --> 37:14.982
He's not anywhere.

37:15.691 --> 37:16.943
What are you talking about?

37:17.610 --> 37:19.487
Well, whatever bogeyman he saw,
it got him.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.322
I hear he's dead.

37:22.782 --> 37:23.741
Real dead.

37:25.451 --> 37:28.913
And for all you guys know,
you could be next.

37:30.998 --> 37:32.208
You still got the patch?

37:36.796 --> 37:38.589
Listen, I can protect you,

37:39.382 --> 37:41.092
but I need to see what Axley saw.

37:45.471 --> 37:46.681
Give us a minute.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.314
Is this your private reserve?

37:55.731 --> 37:57.817
Semetaire lets us keep the good stuff.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.403
Even when it's contraband.

38:15.668 --> 38:16.627
Here.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.189
Everything turned to ruin.

38:37.273 --> 38:39.233
Everything lost.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.777
Hey! Put the knife down.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.904
...turned to ruin.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.783
- I said put the knife down!

39:01.964 --> 39:03.174
Mom!

39:03.841 --> 39:04.717
No!

39:05.760 --> 39:06.594
No!

39:12.350 --> 39:13.434
It's not her.

39:13.893 --> 39:15.770
That's what we've been trying to tell ya.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.031
What the fuck?

39:29.909 --> 39:30.743
Who are you?

39:37.792 --> 39:40.002
That sleeve is not yours.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.187
Can you hear them?

40:16.831 --> 40:18.499
Do you hear the screams?

40:35.641 --> 40:37.977
You're not leaving here in that sleeve!

41:38.037 --> 41:39.914
Who are you?

41:53.385 --> 41:54.553
Tak?

41:56.347 --> 41:57.306
Quell.

42:09.026 --> 42:09.985
Quell.

42:17.284 --> 42:19.328
You need to leave. Now.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.288
Go.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.623
I'll find you.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.335
Protectorate.

42:27.294 --> 42:28.504
Don't move.

42:32.007 --> 42:33.175
You're under arrest.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.972
You don't wanna hear my side?

42:41.100 --> 42:42.351
Move and he's dead.

42:44.979 --> 42:47.523
What's the matter?
Pull the trigger, skulljump.

42:53.028 --> 42:54.363
What the fuck?

42:55.781 --> 42:58.742
You can't do it.
No matter how much you want to.

43:00.869 --> 43:04.164
That sleeve your wearing is Wedge tech.

43:06.625 --> 43:09.044
Let me put it in terms you'll understand.

43:10.087 --> 43:11.880
If we're talking wolves...

43:13.048 --> 43:14.425
I'm the alpha.

43:14.508 --> 43:18.012
You are nothing but my bitch.
