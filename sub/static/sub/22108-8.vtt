Whoa, Tina, you all right there, girl?

00:26.011 --> 00:27.791
Should we unplug her
and plug her back in?

00:27.816 --> 00:29.790
Does anyone know if she's
still under warranty?

00:29.815 --> 00:31.915
Not to be insensitive,
but should we drag her

00:31.950 --> 00:34.391
into a soundproof closet
and just get on with our day?

00:34.416 --> 00:36.049
Or let's at least walk ahead of her.

00:36.085 --> 00:37.984
Or maybe we should put her ahead of us

00:38.020 --> 00:39.686
- so people know we're coming.
- Okay, coming through.

00:39.711 --> 00:41.211
Move. Move!

00:42.194 --> 00:43.710
So, Teddy, you got

00:43.735 --> 00:45.533
any big Valentine's Day
plans tomorrow night?

00:45.558 --> 00:48.626
Oh, yeah. I'm finally gonna
check out that show Law & Order.

00:48.666 --> 00:51.400
I DVR'd 400 episodes.
Gonna try to catch up.

00:51.435 --> 00:54.569
Oh! A night of romantic murder.

00:54.605 --> 00:56.405
No, don't say anything! No spoilers.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.440
Well, Bob and I have
big, big, big plans.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.142
We went on Kissin' Koupons,

01:00.177 --> 01:02.277
that site that's like a
Groupon site for couples.

01:02.313 --> 01:03.912
We got each other fun experiences.

01:03.948 --> 01:05.547
Yeah, I got us a limo ride.

01:05.582 --> 01:07.549
Bob! It was supposed to be a surprise.

01:07.584 --> 01:10.719
- It was?
-Yes. And I'm still not telling you what I got you.

01:10.754 --> 01:11.954
I know how to play.

01:14.529 --> 01:16.425
Some news. Tina's completely broken.

01:16.460 --> 01:19.628
Says you. I like new Tina.
You know what you're getting.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.129
- You know, it's consistent.
- Tina?

01:21.165 --> 01:22.497
Tina, honey, what's wrong?

01:26.847 --> 01:27.736
Tina?

01:27.771 --> 01:29.972
O-Okay, we're gonna have
to figure this out later.

01:30.007 --> 01:34.142
Kids, take your sister
upstairs and do... something.

01:34.178 --> 01:36.411
Tina, talk to Mommy.

01:36.447 --> 01:38.413
Tina, if you tell us what's going on,

01:38.449 --> 01:39.915
- maybe we can help.
- Okay.

01:39.950 --> 01:41.450
Okay, everyone, I made some calls.

01:41.485 --> 01:43.318
- I found out what happened.
- What is it?

01:43.354 --> 01:45.754
I guess Jimmy Jr. has been
hanging out with Becky Krespe.

01:45.789 --> 01:47.522
- Becky whosit?
- Becky Krespe.

01:47.558 --> 01:50.125
She just got her braces off,
and now she's Miss Thang.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.027
Right. And since tomorrow's
Valentine's Day...

01:52.062 --> 01:54.496
Ugh.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.498
Tina's probably worried

01:56.533 --> 01:58.333
that Jimmy Jr. Won't be her valentine.

01:58.369 --> 02:00.802
- Aw, honey, is that it?
- Uh... uh-huh...

02:00.838 --> 02:03.094
It's gonna be okay.

02:03.119 --> 02:04.873
There's a lot of other fish in the sea.

02:04.908 --> 02:06.875
And not little dumb
guppies like Jimmy Jr.

02:06.910 --> 02:09.316
Big, handsome sharks with
big shark muscles. Rrr!

02:09.341 --> 02:10.886
And crabs with abs.

02:10.911 --> 02:12.481
Louise, go pull down
your sister's covers.

02:12.516 --> 02:13.849
Let's get this girl to bed.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.684
It'll all look better in the morning.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.872
- It's only 7:15!
- Do it!

02:17.897 --> 02:19.321
O-Okay. Bob, get her up.

02:19.356 --> 02:22.024
Come on, help me. Come on. Get her up.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.659
- No. - Gene, help your
father, help your father.

02:24.695 --> 02:26.194
Grab the head.

02:26.230 --> 02:30.399
Aw, it's too floppity!

02:32.169 --> 02:34.036
I'm afraid it's gotten worse.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.171
Worse? How is that even possible?

02:38.409 --> 02:39.641
Tina, what's going on?

02:39.676 --> 02:41.209
Use your words, honey. Look at me.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.311
This morning, Zeke texted
Tammy who texted Jocelyn

02:43.347 --> 02:45.984
who accidentally texted me,
even though she meant to text

02:46.009 --> 02:48.045
her cousin Tina who lives
in Clearwater, Florida,

02:48.070 --> 02:49.937
that Jimmy did ask Becky
to be his valentine,

02:49.972 --> 02:51.596
and she said yes, and they're
going on a date tonight,

02:51.621 --> 02:53.401
and it's Valentine's
Day and my life is over!

02:53.426 --> 02:55.704
Time of death: 9:15 a.m.

02:55.730 --> 02:57.697
Time of breath: powerful!

02:57.732 --> 02:59.532
- Sorry.
- No, I love it!

03:02.866 --> 03:05.971
I miss Tina's bones. I
didn't even know I liked them.

03:06.007 --> 03:07.373
I never got to say good-bye.

03:07.398 --> 03:08.864
The worst thing is, this whole time,

03:08.889 --> 03:10.455
she's been sitting on the remote.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.311
Tina? Tina bean-a?

03:12.347 --> 03:13.946
It's me. It's Mommy.

03:13.981 --> 03:15.548
- Hi, Mom.
- It lives!

03:15.583 --> 03:17.550
You remember how you
were gonna babysit tonight

03:17.585 --> 03:19.885
so Dad and I can go
out for Valentine's Day?

03:19.921 --> 03:22.321
Linda, don't say "Valentine's Day."

03:22.357 --> 03:25.054
Uh, s-sorry, sorry. I-I
meant regular February day

03:25.079 --> 03:27.468
that means nothing, stupid February day.

03:27.493 --> 03:29.694
Uh, I-I don't think we can go

03:29.729 --> 03:32.363
on our amazing Kissing
Koupon Valentine's Day.

03:32.398 --> 03:34.131
Sorry.

03:34.167 --> 03:35.666
- Bob, don't say "Valentine's."
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

03:35.702 --> 03:37.835
- Oh, God, now I'm saying it.
Now I said it. - Sorry. Sorry.

03:39.706 --> 03:42.527
Yes! I finally know what
I want to be when I grow up:

03:42.552 --> 03:43.652
that limo!

03:43.677 --> 03:45.877
Oh... my... God!

03:45.911 --> 03:47.710
- I know what we have to do!
- What?

03:47.746 --> 03:50.213
Me and Louise are gonna
take Tina out in the limo

03:50.248 --> 03:52.282
for a girls' night out to cheer her up!

03:52.317 --> 03:54.117
- Oh, great idea.
- Yeah, and you and Gene

03:54.152 --> 03:55.785
are gonna do the thing I bought.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.453
Oh. I... Wait. Why...

03:57.489 --> 03:58.888
Well, we could just stay here.

03:58.924 --> 04:00.390
And waste my Kissin' Koupon?

04:00.425 --> 04:02.325
Are you crazy? It's only for tonight.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.294
- Uh...
- Come on, Bob.

04:04.329 --> 04:05.828
Tina needs this.

04:05.864 --> 04:07.730
Tina needs a girls' night.

04:07.766 --> 04:09.566
A real girls' night.

04:09.601 --> 04:12.335
And we're gonna get in that
limo and give it to her, right?

04:12.370 --> 04:15.038
Yeah! Let's do that thing
where I get in a limo.

04:15.073 --> 04:17.005
- Yeah!
- Okay, fine.

04:17.041 --> 04:20.676
Gene, will you do me the
honor of being my date tonight?

04:20.701 --> 04:23.246
Yes! Just make sure you wait
three days to call me afterwards

04:23.281 --> 04:25.748
so you don't seem too
desperate to be my dad.

04:25.784 --> 04:27.817
Okay, girls, get your miniskirts on.

04:27.852 --> 04:30.019
The li-mom-sine leaves in five!

04:30.055 --> 04:31.921
Okay, Tina? Does that sound fun? Right?

04:31.957 --> 04:34.023
I guess.

04:34.059 --> 04:35.858
Girls' night out! All right!

04:38.795 --> 04:41.092
Hi. We're your riders for tonight.

04:41.110 --> 04:43.911
Hi. Hello. Uh, I'm your
driver. Call me Nat.

04:43.946 --> 04:45.579
They didn't tell me I was driving

04:45.615 --> 04:47.824
three real-life princesses
for Valentine's Day.

04:47.849 --> 04:49.383
Uh-oh.

04:49.418 --> 04:52.715
Uh, Nat, ix-nay on the
Valentine's Day talk, okay?

04:52.740 --> 04:54.622
Yeah. My sister got dumped by a jerk,

04:54.657 --> 04:57.358
and her puberty operating
system is crashing.

04:57.392 --> 05:00.010
- Uh-oh. No bueno.
- Yeah, so we're taking

05:00.035 --> 05:02.110
my little lonely heart
for a fun girls' night out,

05:02.135 --> 05:04.166
and we're not gonna talk
about boyfriends or love

05:04.191 --> 05:05.767
or Valen-you-know-what,
okay?

05:05.792 --> 05:07.720
Copy that. Loud and clear, sir.

05:08.424 --> 05:10.324
Wow! This is nice!

05:10.359 --> 05:13.982
Nat, let's get this baby started
and take her up to about 120?

05:14.007 --> 05:15.974
Okay, excuse me, little
bunny girl? -Yeah?

05:16.009 --> 05:17.976
You can't stand up in the sunroof

05:18.011 --> 05:19.777
- while we're driving.
- Well, what about...

05:19.813 --> 05:21.813
What about Big, the film
starring Thomas Hanks?

05:21.848 --> 05:24.048
It's called "movie magic."
You want to know what happens

05:24.084 --> 05:26.422
when real people drive around
hanging out of a sunroof?

05:26.447 --> 05:29.289
- Yeah. 
- Decapitation. It happens all the time.

05:29.314 --> 05:31.711
There was a huge uptick in them
right after that film came out,

05:31.736 --> 05:33.151
but you didn't hear
anything about it, I'm sure.

05:33.186 --> 05:35.089
- Right? Right?
- I mean, I... I didn't hear anything.

05:35.114 --> 05:37.373
Yeah, not a word.
Government covered it up.

05:37.409 --> 05:38.511
Oh, my gosh.

05:38.536 --> 05:41.411
Thomas Hanks himself got
paid a bunch of hush money.

05:41.446 --> 05:43.043
- How much?
- Around $12,000.

05:43.068 --> 05:45.034
- That all checks out.
- All right, so where to?

05:45.051 --> 05:47.952
Sad girl, you wanna go run over
this kid who dumped you or what?

05:47.987 --> 05:49.487
- No.
- That sounds like a good plan.

05:49.522 --> 05:51.322
No, we're not running anyone over.

05:51.357 --> 05:53.624
But you know what always
makes people feel better

05:53.659 --> 05:55.426
after they get their hearts broken?

05:55.461 --> 05:56.594
- Lizards.
- No!

05:56.629 --> 05:58.496
Throwing a tub of baked
beans at a meter maid.

05:58.531 --> 06:00.164
No! Makeovers.

06:00.199 --> 06:02.433
Pretty sure the right
answer was lizards, Mom.

06:02.468 --> 06:04.502
What do you think, Tina? Makeovers?

06:04.537 --> 06:06.543
- Sure.
- She loves it!

06:06.568 --> 06:09.140
But we should probably get
a bunch of baked beans just in case.

06:09.175 --> 06:11.775
Uh, what do you think
this is for, little miss?

06:11.811 --> 06:14.678
Ah, I knew I'd find my real mom someday.

06:15.533 --> 06:17.648
Okay, so your mom wrote,
"Go down to the wharf,

06:17.683 --> 06:19.683
"turn left at the
cheese-on-a-stick booth,

06:19.719 --> 06:21.619
look up and you'll see it."

06:21.654 --> 06:23.521
- Is it that bird?
- Maybe.

06:23.556 --> 06:25.523
Do you think it's that drunk clown?

06:25.558 --> 06:27.024
I... I wish.

06:27.059 --> 06:28.859
I'd love to push him over.

06:28.895 --> 06:32.463
- Hup! Hup!
- Oh. Oh, no. Oh, God.

06:32.498 --> 06:34.999
Just to warn you, I
ate the perfectly wrong things

06:35.034 --> 06:36.800
for this activity.

06:36.836 --> 06:38.369
Welcome, couples.

06:38.404 --> 06:41.539
Get ready for the night of your life.

06:41.574 --> 06:44.508
I'm Tim Flanagan, and
this is my brother Jerry.

06:44.544 --> 06:47.678
You may be asking yourselves,
"Can I really do trapeze?"

06:47.713 --> 06:50.414
Well, look at me. I got
30, 40 extra pounds on me.

06:50.449 --> 06:52.516
I got diabetes, major depression,

06:52.552 --> 06:55.191
a weird skin thing on
my foot, you name it.

06:55.216 --> 06:57.855
Point is, if I can
trapeze, you can trapeze.

06:57.890 --> 06:59.657
We'll be learning tonight's routine

06:59.692 --> 07:01.525
on the low trapeze over those mats.

07:01.561 --> 07:03.527
And then moving to the high trapeze,

07:03.563 --> 07:05.062
complete with costumes and music.

07:05.097 --> 07:06.519
I know what you're thinking:

07:06.544 --> 07:08.379
"Will I really be ready for all that?"

07:08.404 --> 07:12.649
Well, in 45 minutes, your
answer will probably be, "Sure."

07:12.674 --> 07:13.737
Questions?

07:13.773 --> 07:16.540
- You, mustache.
- Uh, hi. Yes.

07:16.576 --> 07:19.510
I-I'm here with my son,
because, well, it's a long story,

07:19.545 --> 07:22.079
but he's only 11...
Can we still do this?

07:22.114 --> 07:24.348
It's totally okay if the answer is no.

07:24.383 --> 07:26.717
Oh, trapeze is fun
and safe for all ages.

07:26.752 --> 07:29.553
Except children under ten...
They can't participate.

07:29.589 --> 07:31.683
Yay! I'm swinging with my dad!

07:31.708 --> 07:33.224
Damn, one year off.

07:34.325 --> 07:35.653
Uh, excuse me,

07:35.678 --> 07:38.325
but have you three gorgeous
gals seen my clients?

07:38.350 --> 07:39.930
It's us! Look at Tina!

07:39.966 --> 07:42.466
Isn't she breathtaking? Aw, look at her.

07:42.501 --> 07:45.045
I'm looking at her, and I
literally cannot breathe.

07:45.070 --> 07:46.136
And with you,

07:46.172 --> 07:48.476
- what was the thought process?
- Nightmares.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.441
Love it. Now, I know
what we ought to do.

07:50.476 --> 07:52.710
We ought to figure out where
this kid is that messed you up.

07:52.745 --> 07:54.278
- What'd you say his name is?
- Jimmy Jr.

07:54.313 --> 07:56.547
Yeah, terrible name. I hate
him because of his name.

07:56.582 --> 07:58.949
We find out where he is,
and then we go down there,

07:58.985 --> 08:00.985
and you say, "Hey, look
at what you're missing,"

08:01.020 --> 08:03.287
and then you throw a drink
or a smoke bomb on him.

08:03.322 --> 08:04.622
- Um...
- Yes!

08:04.657 --> 08:07.891
No, no. Nat, um, I
appreciate your input,

08:07.960 --> 08:10.194
but what we need is some good
old-fashioned cheer-'em-ups.

08:10.229 --> 08:12.196
Let's crank up some girl power jams

08:12.231 --> 08:14.932
- and limo it out of here!
- You're the boss!

08:14.933 --> 08:16.444
Whoo! Pickles!

08:16.469 --> 08:18.769
- Hey, no sunroof!
- Oh. Sorry. Comin' in.

08:18.804 --> 08:19.903
Whee!

08:19.939 --> 08:21.972
♪ This is a girl power jam ♪

08:22.008 --> 08:24.575

08:39.058 --> 08:40.991
I'm not giving up yet, Tina.

08:41.027 --> 08:42.793
Okay.

08:42.828 --> 08:45.462
All right, let's get
some sugar in this booger

08:45.498 --> 08:46.797
and cheer her up.

08:46.832 --> 08:49.033
What do you mean you
don't have anything?

08:49.068 --> 08:51.769
It's Valentine's Day, and you
don't have a reservation, ma'am.

08:51.804 --> 08:54.171
Oh, come on. My little girl
got her heart broken and she...

08:54.206 --> 08:56.674
- Linda. Linda. Linda.
- Oh, uh, wha... where's that... ?

08:56.709 --> 08:58.342
Come over. I got us a table.

08:58.377 --> 09:00.444
- Nat?
- Follow my voice. Can you see me?

09:00.479 --> 09:02.379
- Hey, it's Nat!
- Follow my voice!

09:02.415 --> 09:04.481
Follow. Follow. Follow. Follow.

09:04.517 --> 09:06.884
- Nat, how'd you do it?
- I know the owner.

09:06.919 --> 09:09.153
Saved his life... After
I hit him with my car.

09:09.188 --> 09:12.222
Now, should we get the mega-misu
flight or the ultra-mega?

09:12.258 --> 09:14.391
Ah, man, Nat, you sit next to me, 'Kay?

09:14.427 --> 09:16.293
And I mean forever.

09:16.329 --> 09:20.122
- Oh, God.
- I know, I know, it's a long way down.

09:20.148 --> 09:22.882
But if you fall, this harness
thing'll catch you, no problem.

09:22.918 --> 09:24.452
Nobody's died on this.

09:24.477 --> 09:26.886
Well, except for one
guy, but that was 'cause

09:26.922 --> 09:28.778
someone dropped a sword
out of a hot air balloon.

09:28.803 --> 09:31.098
Totally unrelated. We weren't liable.

09:31.145 --> 09:32.945
- Hi, Dad!
- Hi, Gene.

09:32.980 --> 09:35.681
All right, I'm gonna let you go
now, and you're gonna swing out.

09:35.716 --> 09:37.583
- Hup, hup!
- Hup, hup!

09:40.027 --> 09:41.854
Okay, good job on the swinging.

09:41.889 --> 09:43.656
Eh, it's all right.

09:43.691 --> 09:46.625
Now, get those legs up! Hup, hup!

09:46.661 --> 09:48.827
Oh, my God. So high up.

09:48.863 --> 09:50.629
Beautiful. Now release your arms.

09:50.665 --> 09:52.765
- Hup, hup!
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God...

09:52.800 --> 09:54.933
Don't barf, don't barf,
don't barf, don't barf...

09:54.969 --> 09:56.535
We're doing it, Dad!

09:56.570 --> 09:59.338
- We're flying!
- I hate it!

09:59.373 --> 10:02.107
Now grab hands! Hup, hup!

10:02.143 --> 10:05.678
- Great job!
- And... let go! Hup!

10:05.713 --> 10:08.681
Hup! Hup! Hup!

10:08.716 --> 10:10.282
I can't!

10:10.318 --> 10:11.617
Hup, please?

10:11.652 --> 10:12.985
Gene, I think we have to let go.

10:13.020 --> 10:15.788
- No way! You let go! But don't!
- I w... I won't.

10:15.823 --> 10:18.957
Guys, please either
let go and swing back

10:18.993 --> 10:20.893
or release your legs and drop.

10:20.928 --> 10:23.028
We have six other couples
to get through tonight.

10:24.565 --> 10:26.799
Uh, I-I think we're
gonna need a minute!

10:26.834 --> 10:31.136
So, my little Tina-misu, how are
you doing? You feeling better?

10:31.172 --> 10:33.005
I'm full.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.973
- Full of sadness.
- Oh.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.875
I don't want to beat a dead horse,

10:36.911 --> 10:38.711
but we could get a dead horse.

10:38.746 --> 10:41.814
And we don't put it in the kid's
bed... he'd be expecting that...

10:41.849 --> 10:44.016
We put it in his backpack
under his homework.

10:44.051 --> 10:46.085
He reaches in, all proud
he did his homework,

10:46.120 --> 10:47.853
and bam! Dead horse.

10:47.888 --> 10:49.755
- It's the perfect plan. Let's
get the check. - All right.

10:49.790 --> 10:51.557
Wow. You guys just said "dead horse,"

10:51.592 --> 10:53.659
like, five times, and
Tina didn't even react.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.694
This is bad. I don't get it, honey.

10:55.730 --> 10:57.830
You're always on and off with Jimmy Jr.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.531
Why is this time so hard?

10:59.567 --> 11:01.934
It's not just that we're off right now,

11:01.969 --> 11:03.936
or even that he has another valentine.

11:03.971 --> 11:06.071
It's... it's... He...

11:06.107 --> 11:07.740
I made him a special picture
frame for Valentine's Day

11:07.775 --> 11:09.742
with a picture of us in
it, but then he hung it

11:09.777 --> 11:11.410
in his locker with a
picture of Becky in it!

11:11.445 --> 11:12.499
- He what?!
- He what?!

11:12.523 --> 11:13.380
That son of a bitch!

11:13.381 --> 11:15.881
Well, that's it. I think
it's time we do Nat's plan.

11:15.916 --> 11:17.549
Okay, I'll call my guy.

11:17.585 --> 11:20.386
It's Valentine's Day so he might
be pretty low on dead horses,

11:20.421 --> 11:22.721
but I'll see what he has
in the raccoon family.

11:22.757 --> 11:25.257
No, no, we're not gonna do
anything with dead horses,

11:25.292 --> 11:27.926
or anything violent, but
we are gonna make sure

11:27.962 --> 11:29.895
his date with Becky doesn't go so great.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.296
Let's do it.

11:31.332 --> 11:33.432
It's time for little JJ to pay pay.

11:33.467 --> 11:35.567
Hear, hear! Now, who has ghillie suits,

11:35.603 --> 11:37.002
and who needs ghillie suits?

11:39.043 --> 11:40.916
All right, first things first.

11:40.941 --> 11:43.208
We need to find out where
this little Rom-ee-no is at.

11:43.243 --> 11:46.044
- Right, right.- And once we
do, and this is just a pitch...

11:46.080 --> 11:48.080
We can all pitch stuff if we want...

11:48.115 --> 11:50.582
What if we hit 'em
with one of these guys?

11:50.617 --> 11:52.017
- What is that?
- A stink bomb.

11:52.052 --> 11:53.685
I got a whole glove
compartment full of 'em.

11:53.721 --> 11:55.287
I throw 'em at white guys, pigeons,

11:55.322 --> 11:57.055
people I've dated etcetera.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.391
Now, Tina, did you ever put
a tracking device on Jimmy?

11:59.426 --> 12:02.127
Sew it into the back of his neck
while he was unconscious, or... ?

12:02.162 --> 12:03.528
Uh, um, no.

12:03.564 --> 12:05.297
- Tina! Ugh!
- I'm sorry.

12:05.332 --> 12:07.099
Damn it! That's okay. That's okay!

12:07.134 --> 12:08.633
- Sorry.
- And you have no idea

12:08.669 --> 12:10.302
where he might be taking Becky tonight?

12:10.337 --> 12:11.737
I don't know. I don't know!

12:11.772 --> 12:13.405
Ooh, ooh, what about this Becky girl?

12:13.440 --> 12:15.974
Could she be a spy? Maybe
some sort of a Cylon?

12:16.009 --> 12:17.709
Where would she want to eat dinner?

12:17.745 --> 12:20.412
- Leave that to me. Nat, phone.
- You got it, boss.

12:20.447 --> 12:22.080
Tina, dial Tammy.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.615
Hey, Tammy, it's Louise Belcher.

12:23.650 --> 12:25.250
- I need Becky Krespe's number.
- What for?

12:25.285 --> 12:26.918
To do something mean.

12:26.954 --> 12:29.321
That's hilarious! Okay, it's 201...

12:29.356 --> 12:31.231
Hi. Has Becky left for her date yet?

12:31.256 --> 12:33.474
She hasn't? Okay, great.

12:33.499 --> 12:35.220
No, I don't want to talk
to her. She hates me. Bye!

12:35.255 --> 12:36.688
Okay, she hasn't left yet,

12:36.724 --> 12:38.623
so if we book it over
there, we can follow.

12:38.659 --> 12:39.983
Tina, do you know where she lives?

12:40.008 --> 12:42.827
712 Forest Lane, blue house with
a little flamingo on the lawn.

12:42.852 --> 12:44.896
- Wow. Stalk much?
- Yes. Like, a lot.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.631
Good girl. Let's roll.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.867
Oh, you know what?

12:48.902 --> 12:51.703
I think it's maybe faster to
just get out and go around.

12:51.739 --> 12:53.572
Nope. I pushed in more and I'm stuck.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.007
Little help here, gals?

12:55.042 --> 12:57.009
Oh, no, no, no, no!

12:57.044 --> 12:59.044
Okay, yeah, that helps.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.479
My bra unhooked.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.314
Oh, I landed on my hand grenade.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.915
- Hand grenade?
- No one freak out.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.602
The guy who sold it to me said
it was inactive. Let's see.

13:07.820 --> 13:08.998
Yup, we're good.

13:09.023 --> 13:10.989
Gene, we can't stay up here forever.

13:11.025 --> 13:12.391
Maybe we could.

13:12.426 --> 13:14.693
I could still have a
very fulfilling life.

13:14.728 --> 13:16.595
Okay, look, on the count of three,

13:16.630 --> 13:18.330
we both let go with our hands.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.998
I don't think I can.

13:20.034 --> 13:22.067
What if instead we let go with our legs?

13:22.102 --> 13:23.435
No! Not our legs!

13:23.470 --> 13:25.237
Guys, you got to let go!

13:25.272 --> 13:27.939
We know, Jerry! Just
let me talk to my son!

13:27.975 --> 13:29.674
We thought you were doing that.

13:29.710 --> 13:31.043
What have you been doing?

13:31.078 --> 13:32.577
We've been busy!

13:32.613 --> 13:34.079
Gene, we have harnesses on,

13:34.114 --> 13:36.515
so we'll fall down, but very gently.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.383
Okay, okay, let's do it.

13:38.419 --> 13:40.052
All right, on the count of three.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.220
- Hundred. - Gene, you
have to trust me, okay?

13:42.256 --> 13:44.222
Look at my face. I am your dad.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.191
I will not let anything
bad happen to you.

13:46.226 --> 13:49.261
- We are going to be fine.
- Okay. I trust you, Dad.

13:49.296 --> 13:52.110
You guys have a very
beautiful relationship.

13:52.135 --> 13:52.931
Now, hup!

13:52.966 --> 13:56.191
Ready? One... two... three.

13:59.073 --> 14:01.039
- You didn't let go!
- I know!

14:01.075 --> 14:02.441
Are you kidding me?

14:02.476 --> 14:03.909
Come on!

14:03.944 --> 14:07.479
I panicked! I couldn't do it!

14:11.085 --> 14:12.951
It's the Pestos. Get down!

14:12.986 --> 14:15.487
There he is, Little Jimmy Jerk-o.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.857
Look at him walking around
with his evil stupid legs.

14:24.498 --> 14:25.831
Nat, follow that car.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.399
You got it, T.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.403
- Aah! You're gonna hit 'em!
- Sorry, sorry.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.671
I got excited.

14:35.843 --> 14:38.677
Ugh. They're having
heart-shaped enchiladas?

14:38.712 --> 14:40.145
It's worse than I thought.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.147
All right, all right, I'm
gonna pull around back.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.682
We'll Goodfellas it through the kitchen,

14:43.717 --> 14:45.150
and then boom! Date over.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.985
You think they'll let us in the back?

14:47.020 --> 14:50.188
Oh, yeah. One of the
busboys is my sensei.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.759
All right, this is a bad angle.

14:54.795 --> 14:56.495
On my signal, we're
gonna casually stroll over

14:56.530 --> 14:58.130
to the ladies' room and regroup.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.699
- Okay, what's the signal?
- "Woof meow. Woof meow."

15:00.734 --> 15:02.801
Of course. That makes sense.

15:02.836 --> 15:05.704
Woof meow! Woof meow!

15:05.739 --> 15:07.472
Thanks for coming out with me, Becky.

15:07.508 --> 15:09.841
You look... you look really
great with your braces off.

15:09.877 --> 15:12.511
Thanks, Jimmy. It's really
exciting to eat caramels again.

15:12.546 --> 15:15.380
- And I can finally understand
what you're saying. - What?

15:15.780 --> 15:17.564
Okay, we're go for phase two.

15:17.589 --> 15:18.950
Tina, you know what you're doing?

15:18.986 --> 15:21.386
Yup. I sneak up as close
as I can get to that table

15:21.421 --> 15:22.821
and drop these eight stink bombs.

15:22.856 --> 15:24.956
Uh, maybe we only need,
like, three stink bombs.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.491
Better give me the other ones.

15:26.527 --> 15:28.026
Okay, I drop these three stink bombs,

15:28.061 --> 15:29.828
smell up the joint and
slip out the back door.

15:29.863 --> 15:31.463
Righty-tighty, Tina.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.331
We'll be right behind you,
and we'll meet you out back.

15:33.367 --> 15:36.001
Hands in, everyone. Girl power on 16.

15:36.036 --> 15:39.838
One, two, three, four, five, six...

15:39.873 --> 15:41.840
- Okay, okay. 16!
- Let her finish, Mom!

15:41.875 --> 15:43.642
- Let her finish! -
Girl... girl power. -Seven.

15:43.677 --> 15:45.410
- Eight. - Okay.
- Keep going, Nat.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.878
- Keep going. - Nine, ten...
- Okay, okay. Six...

15:46.914 --> 15:48.413
- Ten.
- Let her finish!

15:48.448 --> 15:50.081
- Okay! - Keep
going, Nat. -16.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.550
Girl power!

15:51.585 --> 15:53.685
This is the most fun I've ever had.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.858
Okay, here goes nothing.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.868
I can't do it.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.370
What? Huh? Oh.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.838
Tina?

16:13.874 --> 16:15.340
- Tina Belcher?
- Oh, hey, Jimmy Jr., Becky.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.841
Am I on fire? No? Cool.

16:16.877 --> 16:18.543
What brings you guys here this evening?

16:20.973 --> 16:23.641
Tina, what are you doing
here? Did you follow us?

16:23.676 --> 16:26.610
What? No. I-I don't even know who
that limo around back belongs to.

16:28.347 --> 16:30.314
Anyway, how's the enchilada?

16:30.349 --> 16:32.550
Does it taste like, um, uh... a heart?

16:32.585 --> 16:34.852
- Tina, are you okay?
- Yeah, what's going on?

16:34.887 --> 16:37.688
Fine. You caught me.
I-I followed you here.

16:37.723 --> 16:39.690
- Oh, no.
- I got to get out there and save her.

16:39.725 --> 16:42.660
Wait, wait. I think she's
got this, maybe. Let her try.

16:42.695 --> 16:44.495
Becky, the truth is, I-I came here

16:44.530 --> 16:46.762
to stink-bomb the
restaurant and ruin your date

16:46.787 --> 16:48.967
because I was really sad
and jealous that you got

16:48.992 --> 16:51.001
to go out with Jimmy Jr. on
Valentine's Day instead of me.

16:51.037 --> 16:52.503
And that Jimmy Jr. Put your picture

16:52.538 --> 16:54.138
in the frame I made for him.

16:54.173 --> 16:57.700
- Wait. What? - Yeah,
it's a good-size frame.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.492
The picture fit really well.

16:59.527 --> 17:02.066
But the fact is I... I
don't want to be this person.

17:02.091 --> 17:03.950
And, Becky, you seem really nice.

17:03.975 --> 17:05.582
And all you did was get your braces off,

17:05.607 --> 17:07.450
probably because your
orthodontist said it was time.

17:07.474 --> 17:09.275
- It was.
- And you accepted an invitation

17:09.310 --> 17:12.145
to this really, really nice restaurant

17:12.180 --> 17:14.446
with this Wagstaff bad boy,
which anyone would have done.

17:14.482 --> 17:16.516
You didn't do anything
to hurt me on purpose,

17:16.550 --> 17:18.417
and I won't do anything to hurt you.

17:18.453 --> 17:20.185
You don't deserve to
have your date ruined.

17:20.221 --> 17:21.954
Thanks, Tina. You seem nice, too.

17:21.990 --> 17:24.022
Also, you have some
guacamole on your boob.

17:24.059 --> 17:25.758
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

17:25.794 --> 17:28.677
- No. Other boob.
- Oh. Oh, uh, okay.

17:28.702 --> 17:29.667
No. Other boob.

17:29.703 --> 17:31.770
Oh. What, this one?

17:31.805 --> 17:33.872
- It's under... it's underneath.
- Could you give me a chip?

17:33.907 --> 17:35.764
I'll-I'll let you guys
get back to your date now.

17:35.789 --> 17:38.987
Well, actually, Becky, um,
this isn't really working out.

17:39.012 --> 17:40.345
- What?
- What?

17:40.380 --> 17:41.813
Yeah, I-I was gonna wait

17:41.848 --> 17:43.214
until we got our
heart-shaped flaming flan,

17:43.250 --> 17:44.849
but I think we should break up.

17:44.885 --> 17:47.852
There just isn't anything... here.

17:47.888 --> 17:49.687
- Are you joking?
- Probably not.

17:49.723 --> 17:51.389
He does this stuff, like, a lot.

17:51.425 --> 17:55.255
I mean, I-I will, if you
insist, I will hang for the flan.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.327
Oh.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.564
Wow.

17:59.599 --> 18:02.500
Oh, my God, did he just break up
with Becky, too? That little...

18:02.536 --> 18:04.002
Valen-twerp!

18:04.037 --> 18:05.633
Time for a stink bomb from a hot mom!

18:05.658 --> 18:07.396
Wait, uh, wait! Give me one, woman.

18:07.421 --> 18:10.034
Tina, woof meow! Woof meow!

18:11.344 --> 18:12.844
Oh, no! Becky, come with me!

18:12.879 --> 18:14.728
No, this isn't gonna work.

18:14.753 --> 18:16.085
We're the same size. Let's run.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.350
Wait, Tina, come back.

18:17.375 --> 18:20.947
I-I'll date you instead,
uh, um, if you want.

18:20.982 --> 18:22.649
Ew!

18:22.684 --> 18:24.317
I'll smell you in hell.

18:24.352 --> 18:27.487
Uh, wait. Wait. Who... who are you?

18:27.522 --> 18:30.824
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

18:35.163 --> 18:38.531
Guys, it's been over an hour!

18:38.567 --> 18:40.734
I'm worried about your bodies!

18:40.769 --> 18:42.969
Gene, I'm sorry. I-I...

18:43.004 --> 18:44.871
Oh, I can't get my legs off this thing.

18:44.906 --> 18:46.573
Do-do you just want me to drop you?

18:46.608 --> 18:49.676
No! We do this together
or we don't do it at all!

18:49.711 --> 18:52.690
Okay. Just... just going to
go against all my instincts

18:52.715 --> 18:55.482
and plummet to the ground
while holding my child.

18:55.517 --> 18:56.883
Bob, I'm gonna count to three,

18:56.918 --> 18:58.551
and if you don't release your legs,

18:58.587 --> 19:01.554
I'm gonna charge you for a
second trapeze experience.

19:01.590 --> 19:03.757
- The full price.
- We'll pay double!

19:03.792 --> 19:06.526
- Gene, no!
- One, two...

19:06.561 --> 19:09.362
- Full price, Bob!
- No, no, no! No, I'm...

19:09.397 --> 19:11.384
Okay, I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

19:12.534 --> 19:14.400
Why am I doing it this way?

19:14.436 --> 19:17.670
Aw, it hurts so much!

19:17.706 --> 19:20.607
Dad, release your Krakens!

19:20.642 --> 19:23.243
I'm trying, Gene!

19:26.648 --> 19:28.047
That was amazing!

19:28.083 --> 19:29.716
And they let us keep our unitards.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.217
There's an important lesson in there

19:31.253 --> 19:33.286
about peeing in stuff you want to keep.

19:33.288 --> 19:34.888
I feel so alive!

19:34.923 --> 19:36.890
Me, too. I feel like
I could do anything.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.859
- Should we just go home
and watch TV? -Yes.

19:39.895 --> 19:41.127
I love you, Dad.

19:41.163 --> 19:43.096
I love you, too, pal.

19:43.131 --> 19:44.764
Becky,

19:44.800 --> 19:46.900
I'm sorry I ruined
your date with Jimmy Jr.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.902
You didn't. He did.
Should've been a red flag

19:48.937 --> 19:51.538
when he picked me up three hours
late and he called me Betsy.

19:51.573 --> 19:53.139
You know, Valentine's
Day is way more fun

19:53.175 --> 19:54.975
when you spend it with
people you really love,

19:55.010 --> 19:57.410
like your mom and your
sister and your limo driver.

19:57.445 --> 19:59.712
And a girl from your school
you don't know that well.

19:59.748 --> 20:02.415
Boys come and go, but your girls
will always be there for you.

20:02.450 --> 20:04.651
That's right. Yes, they will, sister.

20:04.686 --> 20:07.619
I mean, you know, sometimes
women are awful to other women,

20:07.644 --> 20:10.323
but not us, and not
tonight, baby! Not tonight!

20:10.358 --> 20:12.671
- We doin' this, ladies?
- Let's do it!

20:12.696 --> 20:14.329
Okay, I want you to repeat after me,

20:14.364 --> 20:16.197
and I'm taping it on my phone. Ready?

20:16.233 --> 20:17.860
- I...
- I...

20:17.885 --> 20:20.264
Will not sue you if I get decapitated.

20:20.289 --> 20:23.511
Will not sue you if I get decapitated.

20:23.536 --> 20:25.643
- Let's eat some bugs!
- Yeah.

20:27.344 --> 20:30.478
Suck on this, Thomas Hanks!

20:30.514 --> 20:33.148
