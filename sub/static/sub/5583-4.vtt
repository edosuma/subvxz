WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:04.172
Previously on Empire...

00:04.205 --> 00:06.040
COOKIE: I did 17 hard years
for that money.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.209
He doesn't have a pulse.
RHONDA: If we were suspects,

00:08.242 --> 00:10.010
we would've been
hauled in already.

00:10.044 --> 00:12.146
You have quite the fans.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.714
Does it cause jealousy?

00:13.747 --> 00:15.716
MIMI:
Empire is Lucious Lyon.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.385
Without him,
the company's nothing.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.552
ANIKA:
Lucious, he wants

00:18.586 --> 00:19.887
your music, Cookie.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.522
Every track,
he wants everything.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.823
I got this girl group

00:22.856 --> 00:23.991
I'm producing right now.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.659
You need a real
label behind you.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.894
Sorry, Hakeem.

00:26.927 --> 00:27.995
LUCIOUS:
I bought Apex Radio.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.163
Now your little label

00:29.197 --> 00:31.332
dries up and dies.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.334
You're gonna be a grandfather.
An heir?

00:33.367 --> 00:35.336
I got a feeling about
a second phase for Empire.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.370
Yeah.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.740
You're never gonna find
Vernon Turner.

00:39.773 --> 00:40.908
Your case is stalled.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.076
A murder rap

00:42.110 --> 00:43.344
is only the beginning

00:43.377 --> 00:45.045
of what I have planned for you.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.750
*

00:54.888 --> 00:57.725
* Oh, oh, oh

00:57.758 --> 00:59.793
* I've fought
this fight before *

01:03.397 --> 01:05.599
* And lucked up on a win

01:08.769 --> 01:10.604
* Bravery prevailed

01:10.638 --> 01:14.942
* My opposition fell

01:14.975 --> 01:17.978
* But now they're back again

01:19.747 --> 01:24.084
* Even though all of my fears

01:24.118 --> 01:26.053
* All of my fears *

01:26.086 --> 01:29.557
* And all of my doubts

01:29.590 --> 01:32.426
* All of my doubts *

01:32.460 --> 01:35.629
* Are outside my door

01:35.663 --> 01:38.732
* Ready for war

01:38.766 --> 01:42.403
* Right here and now

01:42.436 --> 01:44.805
* Oh!

01:44.838 --> 01:46.607
* And they're marchin' in

01:46.640 --> 01:50.077
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

01:50.110 --> 01:52.313
* And they're marchin' in

01:52.346 --> 01:56.817
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

01:56.850 --> 01:58.819
* And they're marchin' in

01:58.852 --> 02:00.788
* Ooh, I can hear
the battle cry *

02:00.821 --> 02:02.590
* At war with my heart
and mind *

02:02.623 --> 02:04.992
* And they're marchin' in

02:05.025 --> 02:07.995
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

02:08.028 --> 02:10.964
* Oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.507
(song ends, clapping)

02:19.540 --> 02:20.774
MAN:
That was amazing.
Thank you.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.142
That was good. You like it?

02:22.176 --> 02:24.011
I love it.
Thank you.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.946
It's just, man, I'm-I'm
a little blown away.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.681
Rolling Stone, the
cover, it's crazy.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.817
After the year you've had,
we're lucky to get you.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.984
Thank you very much.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.186
So, uh, tell me
about your new album.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.454
It's gonna be produced
by my dad--

02:33.487 --> 02:34.988
which is amazing.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.457
It's gonna be called The Artist.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.125
It's basically kind
of a manifesto

02:38.158 --> 02:39.293
of everything
I want to become.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.661
You know, it's easy

02:40.694 --> 02:42.330
to lose yourself

02:42.363 --> 02:45.333
in all of this
and-and running Empire.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.634
But this is home.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.636
Doing this, this is what I do.
It makes me happy.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.871
Sir, uh,

02:50.904 --> 02:51.972
I'm sorry to bother you,

02:52.005 --> 02:53.541
but we have
a serious situation here.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.179
What the hell
is going on?

02:59.213 --> 03:01.882
FBI. We have a warrant.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.517
Your warrant does not
give you the right

03:03.551 --> 03:04.652
to ransack my father's office.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.986
In fact, it does.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.221
We'll be done in here shortly,

03:07.255 --> 03:09.022
Mr. Lyon.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.394
Excuse me!
You're violating my rights!

03:13.427 --> 03:15.396
Jamal, give me your phone.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.664
Handle it.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.031
Get that one, too.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.233
Stop!

03:19.267 --> 03:21.735
Look, all I'm saying is,
I-I thought that maybe,

03:21.769 --> 03:23.571
after what I did for
you with Pitbull,

03:23.604 --> 03:27.040
that you might reconsider
teaming up with me again.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.576
(chuckles)
Teaming up with you?

03:28.609 --> 03:29.777
Are you delusional?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.580
All right,
I know you don't trust me...

03:32.613 --> 03:35.416
Mom, you can't trust anybody
in this music business.

03:35.449 --> 03:38.051
My own dad tried to kill
my girl group.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.587
Boy...

03:39.620 --> 03:41.589
we got bigger problems, okay?

03:41.622 --> 03:43.591
Your daddy is trying
to keep us off radio.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.360
So I need some songs
to go viral online.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.028
I need you in the studio.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.097
I'm not giving up
my group, Ma.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.766
This business is about us
being moguls,

03:52.800 --> 03:55.235
so you got to
let me be a mogul.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.070
I can find
a new lead singer.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.606
What if you don't?

03:58.639 --> 04:00.741
If I don't find a girl group
in a week,

04:00.774 --> 04:02.242
I-I promise I'll drop it.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.911
COOKIE:
Okay, Hakeem.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.613
Don't embarrass yourself.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.616
Um, y'all, something's
happening at Empire.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.617
What is it?

04:09.650 --> 04:12.152
They're getting raided
by the Feds.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.122
Call Valentina,

04:15.155 --> 04:16.757
tell her Empire is going down
like the Titanic,

04:16.790 --> 04:19.059
and she needs to come
back to us.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.128
You, call Royale-T.

04:21.161 --> 04:24.632
If you can sign him,
you back with Dynasty.

04:25.833 --> 04:26.934
I'm-a go straight
to Titan's house

04:26.967 --> 04:28.268
and get his black ass
before lunch.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.471
Payback is a bitch, Lucious.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.674
Cookie Lyon, we have a warrant
to search the entire premises.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.927
Hey, look, I'm
sorry to wake you,

04:53.961 --> 04:55.028
but we got a situation.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.664
FBI just raided Empire,

04:56.697 --> 04:58.666
and there's no doubt in my mind
they'll be here any moment.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.167
What? How'd you get in here?

05:00.200 --> 05:01.301
What are you talking about?

05:01.335 --> 05:03.136
I slept in the guest room
with the twins.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.304
I needed that, too.
Thank you.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.506
(chuckles)
Oh, right on.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.507
But come on, chop-chop.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.308
I made coffee.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.843
(distant sirens wailing)
Yeah, exactly.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.680
Looks like our friends
just arrived.

05:12.713 --> 05:15.182
I'll meet them downstairs.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.184
Rise and shine, baby.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.687
(sirens wailing)

05:19.720 --> 05:21.455
Good morning, Ms. Ford.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.956
Just-just wait a second.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.659
Article 45 states no warrant
can be served in a federal case

05:25.693 --> 05:27.695
without a signature
from the presiding judge.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.697
No, it doesn't.
Get the hell out of my face.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.533
Well, can't blame
a man for trying.

05:36.404 --> 05:37.705
Hi there, baby.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.840
Look wherever you like.

05:48.916 --> 05:52.052
The FBI raid this morning
was unsettling for us all,

05:52.085 --> 05:55.556
and I'm sorry to say
I see no end in sight.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.357
I came down here
today to show

05:57.391 --> 05:58.559
my full support
for Lucious Lyon.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.727
In order to protect him,

05:59.760 --> 06:01.228
Jamal Lyon and I agree

06:01.261 --> 06:03.697
that we're going to curb
what we're currently working on

06:03.731 --> 06:06.066
and also restrict
future endeavors.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.736
That's right. I'm going to also
cancel my Rolling Stone cover.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.237
Just doesn't seem like
the right time.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.405
The future is very uncertain.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.706
That's exactly why

06:12.740 --> 06:14.908
we're going
to expand immediately.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.844
Dad, come on, man, you know
you're not supposed to be here.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.746
No, the Feds,
they wanted to play dirty,

06:18.779 --> 06:20.247
they took the gloves off
this morning.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.015
Well, it's game time, bitches.

06:22.049 --> 06:25.519
Now listen up. The reason that
they are raiding Empire

06:25.553 --> 06:28.756
is because they've got nothing,
absolutely nothing,

06:28.789 --> 06:30.390
otherwise, they wouldn't
be shaking us down.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.426
Now, I'm telling you,
I'm gonna beat this rap,

06:32.460 --> 06:35.262
and we're gonna use the press
from all of this

06:35.295 --> 06:38.098
to make Empire bigger
than it's ever been before.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.399
MIMI: Lucious,
I appreciate the bravado,

06:39.433 --> 06:42.402
but I don't see
how this situation

06:42.436 --> 06:43.937
is going to help
our current predicament.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.607
Hip hop wasn't born
on Wall Street, Miss Whiteman.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.442
Where we come from,

06:48.476 --> 06:50.944
if the cops raid your house,

06:50.978 --> 06:52.946
that makes you a G.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.248
If the Feds raid your house,

06:55.282 --> 06:57.084
that makes you an OG.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.786
That gives you
that street cred,

06:58.819 --> 07:00.120
that ghetto pass.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.422
Now the public perception
of Empire

07:02.456 --> 07:04.124
is that we are so raw,

07:04.157 --> 07:08.128
we are so dangerous,
that even the FBI

07:08.161 --> 07:09.296
wants to shut us down.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.131
This is how playas
play to win.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.066
That's what I'm talking about.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.101
(chuckles)

07:14.134 --> 07:15.268
And you are absolutely

07:15.302 --> 07:16.970
gonna do the cover
of Rolling Stone.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.306
This isn't when we hide.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.174
This is when we roar.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.144
And I tell you, we
gonna stick our foot

07:24.177 --> 07:26.814
so far up the FBI's ass,

07:26.847 --> 07:30.784
they gonna wish they never knew
the name Lucious Lyon.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.854
To the Empire.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.660
Now, look, look, I know
everybody is on edge right now,

07:39.693 --> 07:41.328
but just, let's just be easy.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.763
This kind of blanket harassment

07:42.796 --> 07:44.632
is common
in federal investigations.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.999
They ain't got no case,

07:46.033 --> 07:47.467
so they're using
one open investigation

07:47.501 --> 07:49.670
to open another investigation,
that's it.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.605
Damn, you even
talk crooked.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.140
They're casting
a wide net.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.675
Trying to put
more pressure on Dad

07:54.708 --> 07:55.976
by going after his family, too.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.512
This isn't all bad news,
you know.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.447
It means they're desperate.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.952
If I'm guessing correctly,
then...

08:04.985 --> 08:07.187
Vernon done switched
up on them.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.156
Dad, did you kill Bunkie?

08:11.659 --> 08:13.627
Son, I promise you
with every ounce of my soul,

08:13.661 --> 08:15.362
I could never lay a finger
on that man.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.664
You got to remember,

08:16.697 --> 08:18.999
Bunkie and I grew up
in the streets together.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.467
Before I even could look
after myself,

08:20.500 --> 08:21.635
Bunkie was looking after me.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.672
He introduced me
to the love of my life.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.339
I miss him every day.

08:27.541 --> 08:28.508
So what do we do now?

08:28.542 --> 08:29.509
HAKEEM:
Instead of steal our artists

08:29.543 --> 08:31.044
and kick us off the radio.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.145
Yeah.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.047
Welcome to
the music business, baby.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.516
I'm-a run a car
over your snake oil ass.

08:36.550 --> 08:37.718
Drive...
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.052
Say it again.
No, no, fire and ice.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.988
Say it again.
Hey.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.056
You gotta set aside
your differences,

08:43.090 --> 08:44.324
stick together.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.393
This pressure
is gonna continue.

08:46.426 --> 08:48.328
You have to be vigilant

08:48.361 --> 08:50.163
and not give the Feds
a damn thing.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.399
You just gonna have to stay
one big, happy family.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.067
Is that possible?

08:55.402 --> 08:58.005
How long do we have
to put on this show?

08:58.038 --> 08:59.673
Well, this is gonna last
until we find Vernon Turner.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.575
I mean, if we can convince
him not to testify--

09:01.609 --> 09:04.177
and yes, I know, it's
a little illegal,

09:04.211 --> 09:05.579
but it's for the greater cause--

09:05.613 --> 09:08.048
then I guarantee you,
this case gets dismissed.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.618
So we just have to find Vernon.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.566
Vernon?
Oh, my God.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.601
Uncle Vernon? Vernon?

09:29.837 --> 09:32.139
(grunting)

09:34.775 --> 09:36.910
(retching, coughing)

09:36.944 --> 09:39.479
(sighs)
Oh, my God.

09:47.621 --> 09:50.423
Sons of bitches.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.635
(sighs)

10:05.338 --> 10:07.641
Don't tell me you're getting
sentimental on me.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.810
I must be
if I agreed to meet with you.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.813
(sighs)

10:12.846 --> 10:14.314
What do you want?

10:14.347 --> 10:15.949
A truce.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.751
Let us back on urban radio,

10:17.785 --> 10:19.920
do not poach another one
of my artists,

10:19.953 --> 10:20.988
and stay away
from my masters.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.992
Damn, you come in here

10:25.025 --> 10:27.661
with a whole lot of demands,
Miss Cookie Monster.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.262
What's in it for Lucious Lyon?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.765
That video Jamal wanted
to do with Hakeem.

10:31.799 --> 10:32.766
Hmm.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.001
The boys performing together

10:34.034 --> 10:35.635
will send a message to the Feds

10:35.669 --> 10:37.504
that the Lyons are sticking
with their father

10:37.537 --> 10:39.439
no matter what.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.975
It's exactly what you need
right now, Lucious.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.476
Hakeem will do it?

10:43.510 --> 10:45.946
He was pretty pissed off
at me last.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.515
Yeah, well, he had
every right to be,

10:48.548 --> 10:51.018
but it was his idea.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.352
Really?

10:52.385 --> 10:53.987
Yeah.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.522
I told him he was crazy,

10:55.555 --> 10:57.657
but he said we gotta
stick together.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.860
He also said there'd be
a lot of money coming in.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.328
(chuckles)

11:01.361 --> 11:03.130
He's starting
to sound like his mama.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.799
And his daddy.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.667
All right.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.538
They can do the video,

11:11.571 --> 11:13.707
but I'm not budging
on Apex.

11:13.741 --> 11:16.209
Lucious, why do you keep
doing this to your son?

11:16.243 --> 11:18.045
'Cause I'm trying
to turn him into a man.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.513
(laughs)
If he wants radio
bad enough,

11:20.547 --> 11:22.515
he'll find a way
to get back on it.

11:22.549 --> 11:23.884
Because you're
Father of the Year.

11:23.917 --> 11:24.818
Mmm.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.686
What is in it for us?

11:26.720 --> 11:28.221
Don't play me like some trick.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.890
You get a free video out of it.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.725
And I won't try
to poach any of

11:31.759 --> 11:34.061
Lyon Dynasty's clients.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.363
And you'll lay
off my masters.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.497
What are you talking about?

11:37.530 --> 11:38.498
I never tried to take
your masters.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.900
That ain't what Anika said.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.735
Well, she's a liar.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.236
That's what that
bitch does best.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.873
Yeah? Well, that bitch
was your woman once,

11:45.906 --> 11:47.207
so I don't know

11:47.240 --> 11:48.876
who the bigger snake is,
you or her?

11:48.909 --> 11:51.244
Then why are you
in business with her?

11:51.278 --> 11:53.680
You know why.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.382
Ooh!

11:55.415 --> 11:57.184
Grandma Moses just shut up
for the first time.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.886
Oh, you know what?
Call me that again

11:58.919 --> 12:00.520
and I'll snatch your
tongue out your throat.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.588
Grandma.

12:01.621 --> 12:02.923
Grandpa.
Grandma.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.258
Shut up. Look at
your fat stomach. Oh.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.395
And if you want to
see your grandchild,

12:08.428 --> 12:10.730
I would suggest you be

12:10.764 --> 12:12.432
nicer to your son.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.367
Hmm.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.436
Tell me a grandma that
got a ass like this.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.606
* Yeah, yeah

12:19.639 --> 12:21.041
* Yeah

12:21.074 --> 12:24.111
*

12:24.144 --> 12:25.745
* I know that I'm on fleek

12:25.779 --> 12:26.947
* I know that
I'm on fleek *

12:26.980 --> 12:28.448
* I know that I'm on fleek

12:28.481 --> 12:30.283
* Fleek, fleek,
fleek everything *

12:30.317 --> 12:31.384
* I know I'm looking good

12:31.418 --> 12:32.652
* I wish a chick would

12:32.685 --> 12:35.622
* I bet you they gon'
know my name *

12:35.655 --> 12:37.757
* Fleek everything.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.126
You okay?

12:39.159 --> 12:40.593
I mean, honestly,

12:40.627 --> 12:42.262
I kind of feel stupid doing this

12:42.295 --> 12:43.797
with everything that's going on,
but... I'm okay.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.132
Use it.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.433
Show me.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.235
Show me the, uh, the pain

12:48.268 --> 12:49.769
of your father's legal battle.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.139
And remember that, um,
when it's finished,

12:52.172 --> 12:53.473
I'm gonna paint over it

12:53.506 --> 12:55.108
so it looks expressionistic,
you know?

12:55.142 --> 12:57.244
I just... I want to capture
your beautiful soul.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.246
I just want to say
I'm-I'm so honored

12:59.279 --> 13:00.747
that you're-you're
doing this.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.983
I keep telling Michael that I
feel like you're the new Warhol.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.985
Right, babe?
Yeah, he's wonderful.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.954
Yeah. So for you to do
my Rolling Ston cover

13:06.987 --> 13:08.956
is-is pretty dope.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.827
This is wrecking
my soul.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.631
Rainbows. I don't know
what I was thinking.

13:18.665 --> 13:19.833
You look like Lady Liberty.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.134
Um... oh.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.602
Try something
on the keys.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.204
Try playing
something.
All right, cool.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.840
Um...

13:26.874 --> 13:28.675
what do you want me to play?

13:28.708 --> 13:29.977
I want you to play whatever

13:30.010 --> 13:31.344
you're feeling.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.980
I want to be inside you.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.349
(camera shutter clicks)

13:36.383 --> 13:39.219
*

13:41.054 --> 13:42.655
* Might as well be a skeleton

13:42.689 --> 13:44.191
* Uh-huh *

13:44.224 --> 13:46.826
* Ain't have no life within me

13:46.860 --> 13:48.628
* My heart needed
some medicine *

13:48.661 --> 13:50.030
* Uh-huh *

13:50.063 --> 13:52.532
* Couldn't find
the right remedy *

13:52.565 --> 13:54.301
* Sinking deep
in the quicksand *

13:54.334 --> 13:55.535
* Yeah, uh-huh *

13:55.568 --> 13:58.205
* Trying to hide
the way I feel *

13:58.238 --> 14:00.207
* Wouldn't open my heart again

14:00.240 --> 14:01.541
* Uh-huh *

14:01.574 --> 14:04.211
* Until I knew it was real

14:04.244 --> 14:06.546
* But like the wind

14:06.579 --> 14:08.381
* You came and breathed

14:08.415 --> 14:12.219
* Life back
into my heart again *

14:12.252 --> 14:14.387
* You gave my life
God, you are gorgeous.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.056
* New meaning

14:16.089 --> 14:17.490
* You can run but can't hide

14:17.524 --> 14:18.725
* Tell you no lie

14:18.758 --> 14:21.228
* When love finds you

14:21.261 --> 14:25.198
* When love finds you...

14:25.232 --> 14:26.733
* Finds you

14:26.766 --> 14:29.202
* Looking for love.

14:31.604 --> 14:32.839
Hey.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.009
Andre.

14:36.043 --> 14:39.913
Look, I know we've been going
through a whole lot with...

14:39.947 --> 14:43.750
this case and the pressure
it's putting on the family...

14:43.783 --> 14:45.585
And you not letting me
back in at Empire.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.754
That's the consequences
of what you did.

14:47.787 --> 14:50.557
Consequences?
Man...

14:50.590 --> 14:52.725
Dad, all I do
is love you

14:52.759 --> 14:54.894
and all you do
is continue

14:54.928 --> 14:56.729
to shut me out.

14:56.763 --> 15:00.067
Look, I'm sorry for...

15:00.100 --> 15:01.935
I didn't grow up
the way you did.

15:07.407 --> 15:11.278
WOMAN:
Sometimes, mommies need help,

15:11.311 --> 15:13.446
especially since she has
you to take care of.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.448
Your neighbors

15:15.482 --> 15:17.217
tell Child Protective
Services that

15:17.250 --> 15:20.920
Mommy hasn't been
feeling too good.

15:20.954 --> 15:21.955
Do you feel safe here?

15:21.989 --> 15:23.456
That's not true.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.293
I love my boy.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.794
Right, Dwight?

15:27.827 --> 15:30.263
I want to stay with my mommy.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.465
I want to stay
with Mommy.

15:32.499 --> 15:36.103
Look, there ain't a damn thing
I can do about the past,

15:36.136 --> 15:39.472
but I can do something
about the future.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.441
I just want to be
the kind of grandfather

15:41.474 --> 15:42.976
that I wasn't as a father.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.078
I want to...

15:45.112 --> 15:46.479
I want you to know that,

15:46.513 --> 15:48.815
no matter what happens
with the business,

15:48.848 --> 15:51.618
I'm gonna love and protect

15:51.651 --> 15:53.153
your child

15:53.186 --> 15:56.123
with everything
that I got.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.957
The door's always open for you
to see your grandchild.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.159
You know that.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.995
(exhales)

16:02.029 --> 16:03.463
It's a boy, right?

16:03.496 --> 16:05.165
You feel it?

16:06.633 --> 16:07.834
Yeah, I feel it, Pop.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.502
(chuckles)

16:09.536 --> 16:11.938
Such a man.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.141
So how you hanging in there
with all this mess?

16:15.642 --> 16:16.876
Man, that bitch
is crazy.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.847
Can I ask you
a question, Pop?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.149
Go ahead.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.453
If I can make
this all go away,

16:26.486 --> 16:28.521
will you let me
back in Empire?

16:28.555 --> 16:30.023
How?

16:30.057 --> 16:32.325
It's a simple
question, Pop.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.294
If I get the
case dismissed,

16:34.327 --> 16:35.528
am I the CFO again?

16:35.562 --> 16:37.964
Dre, if you make
this mess go away,

16:37.997 --> 16:40.200
you can have anything you want.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.202
(chuckles)

16:42.235 --> 16:44.037
*

16:44.071 --> 16:46.173
Okay.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.907
*

17:07.527 --> 17:09.329
*

17:09.362 --> 17:10.597
Hey, baby boy.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.867
Look, I'm real glad
you're doing this video.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.737
I'm only doing it
'cause I can't

17:17.770 --> 17:19.406
get my own stuff
on the radio.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.708
Now, that's payback
for you leaking that album.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.411
Should be suing your ass,
but I am quite impressed

17:24.444 --> 17:26.079
with how you're dealing
with this adversity.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.415
Inventiveness is what
will help you succeed.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.683
Oh, just like you succeeded
on killing my girl group?

17:30.717 --> 17:33.720
Look, man, I'm sorry
about Valentina.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.555
But...

17:35.588 --> 17:36.923
I want to make it up to you.

17:36.956 --> 17:39.058
I made a beat for you.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.427
Dad, stop hustling me, okay?

17:40.460 --> 17:41.694
I'm onto you.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.029
No, I really did
make this for you.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.064
I'm good.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.935
Okay.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.803
Okay, Dad, I'll listen to it.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.805
No, you good.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.707
When you're ready.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.709
COOKIE:
Why you slithering
around my son?

17:56.743 --> 17:58.711
What did he want?

17:58.745 --> 17:59.879
Play me a beat.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.080
Tryin' to get you

18:01.114 --> 18:03.216
back at Empire, isn't he?

18:03.250 --> 18:06.653
Lying bastard said he wouldn't
poach any more of my clients.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.288
Ma, you ain't gotta worry
about that fool.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.556
It's me and you now.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.823
We're in this together.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.963
Mimi.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.064
I wanted to ask you...

18:18.097 --> 18:21.067
Yeah.
...why buy into Empire?

18:21.100 --> 18:24.504
When I got the word
I was in full remission,

18:24.537 --> 18:26.506
I said to myself, "I'm
gonna have a lot of fun

18:26.539 --> 18:28.675
with the rest
of my life."

18:28.708 --> 18:30.843
I'm glad you made it.

18:30.877 --> 18:34.247
Uh-uh. Uh, white bitch,
you gotta go.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.748
It's Whiteman.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.150
You know, in Russian,

18:37.184 --> 18:40.086
that actually means
"she who owns 20% of Empire."

18:40.119 --> 18:42.422
And that translates
into "she's staying."

18:42.455 --> 18:44.090
Mom, we're moguls now.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.592
So let's just do
this video shoot.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.194
Okay, Keem.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.528
You the boss.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.497
All right,
settle down, settle down.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.698
Good morning, everyone.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.434
As I was just
explaining to Jamal,

18:54.467 --> 18:57.437
Lucious' concept
for the video is...

18:57.470 --> 19:00.039
a post-apocalyptic
Black Panther theme

19:00.072 --> 19:02.509
with the brothers
fighting police oppression.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.711
That's real subtle,
Lucious.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.346
It's not a time for subtlety.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.948
It's time for the Lyons
to send a clear message

19:08.981 --> 19:10.283
they will not tolerate
police harassment

19:10.317 --> 19:11.951
of people of color.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.621
So, what? You and k.d. lang,
y'all best friends now?

19:14.654 --> 19:16.956
Ma, we all best friends.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.192
You ready, Mal?
Yeah, I'm ready, Hakeem.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.993
Let's get it.
Power to the people!

19:27.267 --> 19:29.101
(exhales sharply)

19:33.773 --> 19:35.642
(Andre sighs)

19:35.675 --> 19:37.310
Hey.
Hey.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.078
You feeling okay?

19:39.111 --> 19:40.813
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.081
Yeah?

19:42.114 --> 19:43.483
Why?

19:43.516 --> 19:44.917
Well, I just heard
you last night,

19:44.951 --> 19:46.786
so I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.157
(water running)

19:51.190 --> 19:53.192
(more water running)

19:55.795 --> 19:57.897
Rhonda, I'm gonna dig him up.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.932
Why?

19:59.966 --> 20:02.101
It's my only way
back into Empire.

20:02.134 --> 20:04.003
If I produce the body,
the case goes away.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.572
No. Oh, my God, no.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.407
No. Well, if you'd get caught,
I go to prison.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.442
I'll never let that
happen to you.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.843
I'll tell 'em
it was me

20:10.877 --> 20:13.446
before I let
that happen.

20:13.480 --> 20:17.049
And this is worth spending
your life in prison to do?

20:19.986 --> 20:22.455
Rhonda, I need to
tell you something.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.123
What?

20:24.156 --> 20:27.126
God's been
speaking to me.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.500
How has he been speaking to you?

20:35.635 --> 20:38.371
I can't explain how,
I just feel it.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.872
Oh, my God.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.708
It's okay.
Listen...

20:41.741 --> 20:43.142
(exhales)

20:43.175 --> 20:46.446
He wants me to keep
seeking Empire

20:46.479 --> 20:48.481
and I'm gonna follow
his word, baby.

20:48.515 --> 20:51.418
I have to follow
his word.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.291
Thank you...

20:58.325 --> 20:59.726
Thank you.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.228

21:06.333 --> 21:08.768

* Say *

21:27.954 --> 21:29.922

* Think about it,

21:32.459 --> 21:34.193
* Ain't no need
to think about it *

21:34.226 --> 21:36.195
* Get that money,

21:37.530 --> 21:38.698

* Say ain't about the money

22:19.071 --> 22:21.307
* It's about the power.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.743
It's nice seeing the
family together.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.749
Yeah, hey, girl.
No, we on a break now.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.984
No, I don't want no Indian food!

22:32.018 --> 22:33.319
You know it give me the...

22:33.352 --> 22:35.988
(siren chirps)
Cookie Lyon!
So?

22:36.022 --> 22:37.924
You're under arrest.
Porsha, call my lawyer!

22:37.957 --> 22:39.826
I'm being harassed
by the cops again.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.594
Why are you arresting me?!

22:41.628 --> 22:43.663
You have an outstanding warrant
for failure to appear in court.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.231
Oh, man, that's some bull!
Get off of me!

22:45.264 --> 22:46.499
Is somebody recording this?!
Watch your head, ma'am.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.100
If I die in police custody,

22:48.134 --> 22:49.636
I did not commit suicide!

23:00.146 --> 23:02.148
*

23:07.153 --> 23:09.288
You can't keep me in here!

23:09.321 --> 23:10.990
I didn't do nothing!

23:12.559 --> 23:14.060
I know you see me in here!

23:14.093 --> 23:15.061
I know my rights!

23:15.094 --> 23:16.863
I want my lawyer, bitch!

23:16.896 --> 23:19.799
I didn't even do nothing!

23:19.832 --> 23:22.034
MAN:
You have a visitor.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.303
Hello, Cookie.

23:24.336 --> 23:25.872
It's good to see you.

23:25.905 --> 23:29.108
Have a seat.

23:29.141 --> 23:32.812
You can't keep me here
with no probable cause, so...

23:32.845 --> 23:34.213
I got cause.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.482
There's a warrant
out for your arrest.

23:35.515 --> 23:36.382
For what?

23:36.415 --> 23:37.550
You jumped a turnstile

23:37.584 --> 23:38.785
and never showed up to court.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.052
(laughs):
Turn...

23:40.086 --> 23:42.555
Do I look like
I catch the subway?

23:42.589 --> 23:44.323
Seems this individual,
when given a ticket,

23:44.356 --> 23:45.992
gave the name Cookie Lyon

23:46.025 --> 23:47.159
to the arresting officer.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.629
Now, do you know her?

23:49.662 --> 23:51.163
It's my soon-to-be
ex-assistant.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.233
Ah.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.069
I get it.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.238
You're pushing hard.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.907
But for what?

24:00.940 --> 24:03.309
Till I snitch on Lucious?

24:03.342 --> 24:04.644
You're on parole, honey.

24:04.677 --> 24:06.345
And I find the tiniest
little fracture,

24:06.378 --> 24:08.247
I'll send you away for years.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.650
Well, you can keep
right on digging, honey.

24:10.683 --> 24:13.085
'Cause me and my boys,

24:13.119 --> 24:15.354
my family, we're Lyons.

24:15.387 --> 24:18.825
We're strong, so dig away.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.426
Even that bipolar son of yours?

24:20.459 --> 24:23.429
Yeah.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.197
Honey, I will hurt your kids.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.166
Real bad.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.434
How is Andre gonna respond

24:28.467 --> 24:30.436
when I leak his recent
medical report?

24:30.469 --> 24:32.639
Ooh, child, I sure hope
he don't kill himself.

24:34.406 --> 24:35.775
(quiet laugh)

24:35.808 --> 24:37.376
You need to kill yourself

24:37.409 --> 24:40.513
and that wack weave
you got up top your head.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.682
(laughs)
Go ahead, Cookie.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.951
Play hard, but I got you.

24:44.984 --> 24:48.120
Now, if you don't
give me what I want,

24:48.154 --> 24:50.489
I'll come after your boys.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.081
Geez!

25:15.114 --> 25:16.649
Sorry.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.484
You scared the hell out of me.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.086
What are you doing here?

25:20.119 --> 25:22.088
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not coming with me.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.556
It's too dangerous.
I need to be alone

25:23.590 --> 25:25.057
in case something happens.
No.

25:25.091 --> 25:27.660
I'm ride or die.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.829
All the way.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.831
Till death do us part.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.866
Or prison.

25:36.936 --> 25:39.038
*

25:48.581 --> 25:50.016
Yeah...

25:50.049 --> 25:52.051
It's hard.
This beat is dope.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.187
That's what I've
been telling you.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.255
And it's yours.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.290
If what?
What do you think?

25:58.324 --> 25:59.792
Come on back to Empire.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.861
Lyon Dynasty, they don't
have the resources

26:01.894 --> 26:04.363
to do what we
can do for you.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.532
You know it's time.
Come on back home, man.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.134
I'm rocking with Ma now.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.270
Where is she?

26:11.303 --> 26:13.105
Anybody heard
from her for hours?

26:13.139 --> 26:14.874
She's unreliable.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.709
Look, come back to me.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.377
First thing in the morning,

26:18.410 --> 26:20.479
you're back on the radio.

26:20.512 --> 26:22.982
And I'll even let you
manage Valentina.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.225
(crying):
I don't care anymore.
I just want to die.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.827
I just want to die.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.829
Oh, God.

26:36.863 --> 26:40.933
Please, please, please...

26:40.967 --> 26:42.735
I can't take it anymore.

26:42.769 --> 26:43.970
(sobs)

26:44.003 --> 26:46.072
Please...

26:46.105 --> 26:47.674
Oh, God...

27:04.691 --> 27:06.659
Get Roxanne Ford in here.

27:06.693 --> 27:08.795
We'll see.

27:22.541 --> 27:23.876
I apologize
for disrupting your, um,

27:23.910 --> 27:24.877
your video shoot thing.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.445
I just really needed you
to see this

27:26.478 --> 27:27.847
the second it was completed.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.448
It-it-it's-it's beautiful.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.783
Thank you.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.518
Really, thank
you so much.

27:32.551 --> 27:34.553
Oh, my God!

27:34.586 --> 27:37.690
Oh, my God,
that's astonishing.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.291
You were able

27:39.325 --> 27:42.962
to capture the talent
and artistry of my son.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.230
You're a genius.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.464
Jamal is the genius.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.799
I just wanted
to make a portrait

27:46.833 --> 27:48.735
worthy enough
of an heir to an Empire.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.870
Hey, yo, Mal, man, let's work.
What is this?

27:50.903 --> 27:52.138
Can't we get
this out of here?

27:52.171 --> 27:53.572
Why, man?
It's beautiful.

27:53.605 --> 27:55.074
Yeah, if tacky and ugly
is beautiful.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.576
You think that's, uh,
tacky and ugly?

27:57.609 --> 27:58.978
No, he didn't mean that.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.146
Yeah, I did.
It's the most

28:00.179 --> 28:01.580
ugliest painting
I seen in my life.

28:01.613 --> 28:02.815
LUCIOUS:
What in the hell

28:02.849 --> 28:04.483
is wrong with you, man? Why...

28:04.516 --> 28:06.318
Why can't you just be
happy for your brother?

28:06.352 --> 28:08.054
Because I came here
to shoot a music video,

28:08.087 --> 28:09.488
but instead you
got me distracted

28:09.521 --> 28:11.157
with this big-ass
painting in my face.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.658
If Cookie was here, she would've
had this thing gone

28:12.691 --> 28:14.160
before I walked in here;
you know that.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.928
Well, Cookie ain't here!

28:15.962 --> 28:17.930
But if you can't work
without your mama being here,

28:17.964 --> 28:20.166
maybe we should
shut the whole damn thing down

28:20.199 --> 28:21.834
and wait for her ass
to get here!

28:21.868 --> 28:23.169
I can shoot without her.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.336
Ain't about nothin'.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.738
You sure, mama's boy?

28:25.772 --> 28:27.073
Call me that one more time,

28:27.106 --> 28:28.607
you gonna see what happen.

28:28.640 --> 28:32.511
You know why I made Jamal
the head of the company?

28:32.544 --> 28:36.048
Because he can do the work
without his mama.

28:43.322 --> 28:44.690
All right.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.325
Let's shoot.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.199
Now, remember,
you'll defeat the riot squad

28:53.232 --> 28:54.901
with your brotherly love.

28:56.002 --> 28:57.937
Hmm, okay.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.872
And action!

28:59.906 --> 29:04.210
* When I'm in your presence,
you can feel the power *

29:04.243 --> 29:06.979
* Even if the company
was built from powder *

29:07.013 --> 29:11.117
* Girls kissing on the couch,
women in the shower *

29:11.150 --> 29:14.153
* Surround myself with kings,
you can keep the cowards *

29:14.186 --> 29:16.455
* Get ready for the takeover,
that facelift *

29:16.488 --> 29:18.991
* And that makeover,
that case that I'll break open *

29:19.025 --> 29:22.061
* That Grey fifth
like Beethoven *

29:22.094 --> 29:25.131
* If you wanna get it poppin',
I can beam the team *

29:25.164 --> 29:28.067
* 34 in the rocket,
'cause Hakeem's the dream *

29:28.100 --> 29:31.337
* Hakeem's the dream,
Hakeem's the dream *
(laughs) * Get it?

29:31.370 --> 29:34.240
* Ooh, we making moves

29:34.273 --> 29:37.910
* You only doin'
what my power lets you do *

29:37.944 --> 29:40.813
* You see that money
isn't everybody thing *

29:40.847 --> 29:44.416
* When it come to power,
can only be one king *

29:44.450 --> 29:47.920
* Said if I don't know nothing,
I know this paper *

29:47.954 --> 29:51.858
* Bigger than the world,
stepping over skyscrapers *

29:51.891 --> 29:55.327
* If I don't know nothing,
one thing I know *

29:55.361 --> 29:59.031
* Power over money, man,
and that just how it go *

29:59.065 --> 30:01.834
* If you know like I know say

30:01.868 --> 30:04.436
* It ain't about the money,
it's about the power *

30:04.470 --> 30:06.538
* Say it ain't about the money

30:06.572 --> 30:08.941
* It's about the power
* If you know like I know say

30:08.975 --> 30:11.510
* Ain't about the money,
it's about the power *

30:11.543 --> 30:13.612
* Say ain't about the money

30:13.645 --> 30:16.482
* It's about the power.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.653
(all gasping)

30:26.425 --> 30:28.627
Why y'all looked shocked?!

30:28.660 --> 30:30.729
This family
never been a real family.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.432
I'm out of here
and I ain't never coming back.

30:38.004 --> 30:40.072
Okay, if I give you
what you need,

30:40.106 --> 30:42.141
you got to let me
out of here right now.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.143
I cannot miss
another night with my sons.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.978
I missed too many.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.314
If it's good, Cookie, honey,
you can leave right away.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.049
Okay.

30:50.082 --> 30:53.986
I don't know if Lucious
shot or killed Bunkie.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.222
(gasps)
I really don't.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.490
But what I do know
is that they were fighting

30:58.524 --> 31:01.327
over this radio station.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.062
The Apex Radio deal?

31:03.095 --> 31:04.730
Yeah, that's the one.

31:04.763 --> 31:06.899
Uh, Bunkie was, uh, trying

31:06.933 --> 31:08.901
to stop Lucious
from purchasing it.

31:08.935 --> 31:12.338
And then,
Bunkie comes up dead.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.573
And Lucious
makes a deal for Apex

31:14.606 --> 31:16.675
the first week
he gets out of prison.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.077
Yeah.

31:18.110 --> 31:21.247
Ah, this isn't bad, Cookie.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.515
We'll start investigating
the deal right away.

31:23.549 --> 31:26.185
At the very least,
we'll tie it up for years.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.787
Yeah, well, Lucious
is gonna fight you on that,

31:28.820 --> 31:31.190
because he really wants
this deal to go through.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.591
It's as good as dead.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.561
Now, was that so hard?

31:37.063 --> 31:39.031
No.
(chuckles)

31:39.065 --> 31:42.301
And your weave is nice,
I'm sorry.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.903
And so is your wig.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.143
Are you sure this
is the right spot?

31:51.177 --> 31:52.778
Yeah, remember?

31:52.811 --> 31:54.480
It's right in front
of the tree with the hole.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.382
It's our marker.

31:56.415 --> 32:00.386
I know, but I just feel
like we would've

32:00.419 --> 32:02.421
hit it by now.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.730
Oh, God, no!

32:11.763 --> 32:13.132
Babe, we have a big problem!

32:13.165 --> 32:14.566
What?

32:14.600 --> 32:17.169
All of these trees
have the same hole.

32:17.203 --> 32:19.505
It's impossible, Rhonda.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.073
Andre!

32:21.107 --> 32:22.908
They all have the same hole!

32:22.941 --> 32:24.343
Oh, my God!

32:34.453 --> 32:35.921
Oh, God.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.689
Rhonda, it could be anywhere.
Yeah.

32:37.723 --> 32:40.092
It could be anywhere!

32:40.126 --> 32:42.528
Oh, my God!

32:52.971 --> 32:55.507
Look, man, I'm sorry.
I...

32:55.541 --> 32:57.443
I don't even know what to say.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.045
My brother's always
had a bad temper.

32:59.078 --> 33:01.680
And he's a spoiled brat,
but I feel horrible.

33:01.713 --> 33:02.881
Don't.
Don't feel horrible.

33:02.914 --> 33:03.949
It's okay.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.451
It's not okay;
he ruined your work.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.853
No. No, no.
No, he-he didn't.

33:07.886 --> 33:10.856
He, um... he just...

33:10.889 --> 33:12.291
he just changed it.

33:12.324 --> 33:15.694
Art is, um,
it's-it's fluid, Jamal.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.064
It's-it's ephemeral.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.066
This is the
painting now.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.700
This is what
it has to say.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.569
What, that I should have
my throat slit?

33:23.602 --> 33:25.571
Yes, it represents
the violence and the anger

33:25.604 --> 33:27.373
of a... of a racist
and homophobic society.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.310
It's genius.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.612
Yeah, really powerful.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.149
Don't dig there, Rhonda.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.550
It's right in front
of a tree, baby.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.986
Andre, we have to stop.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.888
We are just not gonna find it.

33:42.921 --> 33:44.656
No, it's here,
we just have to keep trying.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.492
We don't have time
to keep trying.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.727
The sun is gonna come up
in, like, two hours.

33:48.760 --> 33:49.828
We're gonna get caught.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.663
This is it, Rhonda.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.499
It's my last shot
at getting back in.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.101
I know, baby, I understand.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.935
But it's not worth it.

33:56.968 --> 33:59.438
We should just fill these holes
up and get the hell out of here.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.941
There's more to life
than Empire.

34:04.776 --> 34:05.944
Okay.

34:05.977 --> 34:07.346
Okay.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.780
Okay, let's go.

34:08.814 --> 34:10.182
Big one first.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.650
Okay, right.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.691
Oh, my God.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.927
Get down, get down.

34:21.960 --> 34:22.961
Okay, okay.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.587
MAN: Come on out of there
with your hands up.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.857
Okay.

34:53.024 --> 34:54.660
(crying)

34:58.664 --> 34:59.998
Oh, God...
Who are you?

35:00.031 --> 35:02.000
LUCIOUS:
The devil himself,

35:02.033 --> 35:04.035
and I want your soul.

35:05.371 --> 35:07.173
Dad?

35:07.206 --> 35:08.507
(chuckles)

35:08.540 --> 35:11.076
What are you
doing here?

35:11.109 --> 35:13.078
I had Thirsty put
a tracking device on your car

35:13.111 --> 35:15.481
after our little conversation
at Laviticus.

35:15.514 --> 35:19.017
Thought this might be
what you was talking about.

35:19.050 --> 35:20.752
What did you do to your uncle?

35:20.786 --> 35:22.754
RHONDA:
He was...

35:22.788 --> 35:24.756
fighting with Andre,

35:24.790 --> 35:28.160
and I hit him over the head
with a candlestick,

35:28.194 --> 35:30.429
and he just never woke up.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.432
You saved my life.

35:33.465 --> 35:36.034
RHONDA: Oh, my God.
(electronic buzzing)

35:36.067 --> 35:37.869
What is that?

35:37.903 --> 35:40.172
(buzzing)
It's your basic
corpse-detection system.

35:40.206 --> 35:43.542
And you just
have that handy?

35:43.575 --> 35:45.110
Only for the holidays.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.112
It'll just be
a few minutes.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.547
RHONDA:
Yeah.
(buzzing)

35:48.580 --> 35:50.549
Wow, you buried
him good, huh?

35:50.582 --> 35:52.684
Very proud of you.

35:52.718 --> 35:55.053
*

35:55.086 --> 35:56.455
(beeping)
Bingo.

35:56.488 --> 36:00.058
* Grab your coat
and get your hat *

36:00.091 --> 36:04.563
* Leave your worry
on the doorstep *

36:04.596 --> 36:07.566
* Life can be so sweet

36:07.599 --> 36:10.969
* On the sunny side
of the street *

36:11.002 --> 36:15.407
* I used to walk in the shade

36:15.441 --> 36:19.711
* With those blues on parade

36:19.745 --> 36:23.549
* But I'm not afraid

36:23.582 --> 36:26.985
* This rover crossed over

36:27.018 --> 36:31.657
* If I never have a cent

36:31.690 --> 36:35.427
* I'll be rich as Rockefeller

36:35.461 --> 36:39.164
* Gold dust at my feet

36:39.197 --> 36:41.567
* On the sunny...

36:41.600 --> 36:46.037
* Sunny side of the street...

36:52.711 --> 36:54.680
(applause)
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

36:54.713 --> 36:56.615
my cousin Laura
is gonna do a song,

36:56.648 --> 36:58.350
and this is her first time
in front of an audience,

36:58.384 --> 37:00.352
so let's show
mi prima some love.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.787
Ladies and gentlemen,
Laura Calleros.

37:01.820 --> 37:02.888
(applause)

37:05.291 --> 37:07.693
Hi.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.728
(band begins playing)

37:11.797 --> 37:16.602
* Triste y preocupado estoy

37:16.635 --> 37:21.373
* Soletita cuando me voy

37:21.407 --> 37:24.410
* En lago azul

37:26.845 --> 37:31.650
* Trabajando sin descansar

37:31.683 --> 37:35.821
* Cuando pienso
lo qué es amar *

37:35.854 --> 37:40.659
* Esperando mi amor escuchar

37:40.692 --> 37:44.630
* En lago azul

37:44.663 --> 37:48.300
* Un día llegaré

37:48.334 --> 37:56.141
* Otra vez a ver mi lago azul

37:56.174 --> 37:58.410
* Con cariño ver

37:58.444 --> 38:04.783
* A quien amo yo
en mi lago azul *

38:06.452 --> 38:11.256
* Ver las lanchas
como mariposas *

38:11.289 --> 38:15.427
* Otra vez al despertar

38:15.461 --> 38:18.864
* Cuando sale el sol

38:18.897 --> 38:24.970
* Mi corazón quiere cantar

38:26.972 --> 38:31.777
* Voy a ver mi amor otra vez

38:31.810 --> 38:36.548
* Ya solita nunca seré

38:36.582 --> 38:41.219
* Tan contenta yo estaré

38:41.252 --> 38:45.557
* En lago azul

38:47.593 --> 38:52.130
* Trabajando sin descansar

38:52.163 --> 38:57.636
* Cuando pienso lo qué es amar

38:57.669 --> 38:59.538
* Esperando mi amor...

38:59.571 --> 39:00.972
See that?

39:01.006 --> 39:02.974
You're more than
an artist now.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.643
You are the art.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.812
* En lago azul

39:06.845 --> 39:09.214
* Comocito mío

39:09.247 --> 39:11.249
* A mi lado estas

39:11.282 --> 39:14.085
* Luna de plata

39:14.119 --> 39:16.555
* Agua de cristal

39:16.588 --> 39:19.324
* Ya podré olvidar

39:19.357 --> 39:24.162
* Con mi amor mío...

39:24.195 --> 39:29.000
* En lago...

39:29.034 --> 39:34.673
* Azul...

39:34.706 --> 39:37.709
* Ah...

39:37.743 --> 39:40.178
THIRSTY:
We only got a few more feet.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.213
(coughing)

39:43.281 --> 39:44.816
(grunting)

39:47.786 --> 39:49.187
Hey, wait, wait, h-hold on.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.589
I'm gonna say something.

39:50.622 --> 39:52.023
Now?!

39:52.057 --> 39:53.459
We never said anything before.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.060
Go ahead.

39:57.963 --> 40:01.767
I'm so sorry for what we
did to you, Uncle Vernon.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.535
And if I could change
what happened, I...

40:03.569 --> 40:04.803
I'd change everything.

40:07.238 --> 40:10.041
I'd tell you that I love you,

40:10.075 --> 40:13.078
and, uh... that I forgive you.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.316
I wouldn't be the man I am today
if you hadn't looked after me

40:18.349 --> 40:19.751
like you did
for all those years.

40:22.688 --> 40:24.656
I'll miss you forever.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.526
God, help me.

40:28.994 --> 40:30.395
That was really
beautiful, son.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.963
Geez.

40:31.997 --> 40:33.398
Really.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.800
If y'all don't mind,

40:34.833 --> 40:36.802
can I have a minute to say
good-bye to my friend?

40:36.835 --> 40:38.236
Yeah.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.938
We'll get the shovels.

40:46.377 --> 40:49.214
You rot in hell, you snitch.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.689
Hey, son.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.259
(clears throat)

41:01.292 --> 41:03.695
Yes, sir.

41:07.533 --> 41:09.334
I'm sorry.

41:09.367 --> 41:12.170
It's okay.

41:16.207 --> 41:18.209
Welcome back to Empire.

41:21.046 --> 41:23.048
Thank you, Pop.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.150
(sighs)

41:25.183 --> 41:27.185
Damn.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.987
(sighs)

41:33.525 --> 41:35.861
You missed 'em.

41:35.894 --> 41:38.329
They finished a
few hours ago.

41:38.363 --> 41:40.331
Yeah, I figured that.

41:40.365 --> 41:42.367
I'm just glad you called.

41:46.204 --> 41:48.173
I spoke to Royale-T.

41:48.206 --> 41:50.175
I think we might be
closing in on him soon.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.843
Yeah, that doesn't
really matter,

41:51.877 --> 41:54.546
'cause it's not
gonna work out.

41:54.580 --> 41:56.381
I spoke to Lucious,

41:56.414 --> 41:59.417
and he said he never asked you
to steal our masters.

42:01.419 --> 42:03.388
Cookie... (scoffs)

42:03.421 --> 42:05.423
Lucious is lying.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.393
I know.

42:08.426 --> 42:11.196

the Apex Radio deal, okay?

43:11.256 --> 43:13.291
