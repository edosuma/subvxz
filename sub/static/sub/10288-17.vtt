Pin's out.

14:30.955 --> 14:33.415
Gotta go. bye. What happened?

14:33.591 --> 14:35.081
He tried to interrupt Florence.

14:35.260 --> 14:38.820
Oh. the fool. the mad fool!

14:38.997 --> 14:43.327
Okay. give me that pineapple.
you bonehead.

14:43.501 --> 14:46.801
-Florence.
-Get her away from me. she's nuts.

14:46.971 --> 14:49.271
Hector. you put the pin
back in the grenade.

14:49.439 --> 14:52.239
I want action. and I want it now.

14:52.409 --> 14:53.899
SIMPSON:
You want action?

14:54.278 --> 14:56.648
The American people have had it.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.913
We've been kicked around too long.

14:59.082 --> 15:01.212
We're getting ready to fight.

15:01.385 --> 15:03.505
[YELLING]

15:06.690 --> 15:08.820
Jump in any time. guys.

15:09.359 --> 15:13.059
Okay. that's it. I've had it with you guys.
I'm pulling the pin.

15:14.430 --> 15:16.330
HARRY: Get out of here.
-Who are you?

15:16.499 --> 15:18.189
-Your lawyer. Yes.
-Didn't I mug you?

15:18.367 --> 15:20.727
Boy. this is not my day.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.467
Miss Sullivan.
this is really very dangerous.

15:23.639 --> 15:26.629
You mentioned commitment?
You're about to see some now.

15:26.809 --> 15:28.469
Attagirl. you tell him.

15:30.545 --> 15:34.065
What the hell are you?

15:35.350 --> 15:39.050

and the American way of life.

It's okay. It's okay.

15:49.761 --> 15:53.431
Give me the grenade.
Believe me. nobody wants to hurt you.

15:53.598 --> 15:55.398
Step aside. I'll get a clean shot.

15:55.567 --> 15:56.857
What is the matter with you?

15:57.034 --> 15:59.734
This is not mob rule.
This is not a fascist state.

15:59.904 --> 16:01.674
Haven't you ever heard of due process?

16:02.206 --> 16:04.676
Isn't that how they make Velveeta?

16:07.545 --> 16:09.705
Get out. Now.

16:10.814 --> 16:12.874
You think the bullets
were a little too much?

16:16.618 --> 16:19.708
Hey. you're one gutsy broad.

16:19.888 --> 16:21.378
Thank you.

16:21.590 --> 16:23.850
And never call me a broad.

16:26.662 --> 16:29.832
-What's your name?
-Hector.

16:30.432 --> 16:34.702
Listen. Hector.
do you understand the situation here?

16:34.870 --> 16:40.500
You are never going to be able
to go out any of those doors. Ever.

16:42.144 --> 16:45.414
Eventually.
a SWAT team will be called in.

16:45.581 --> 16:48.641
So why don't you do it my way?

16:49.017 --> 16:50.447
What's your way?

16:51.520 --> 16:54.960
You give me the grenade.

16:55.124 --> 16:57.154
And I'll get you a fair trial.

16:58.526 --> 17:03.256
What if you give me a fair trial first
then I give you the grenade?

17:04.830 --> 17:06.731
Lady. I'm scared. I don't wanna get shot.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.839
Okay. Okay. How about this?

17:10.002 --> 17:14.703
You put down the grenade.
and if anybody shoots you...

17:15.375 --> 17:17.204
...you can kill me.

17:20.646 --> 17:22.047
With what?

17:23.517 --> 17:26.977
-With this.
-A fork?

17:27.487 --> 17:30.387
-Will somebody get me something lethal?
-Wait. You're serious?

17:30.557 --> 17:31.617
Yes. I'm serious.

17:31.792 --> 17:35.992
Hector. you have got to start
trusting somebody sometime.

17:36.163 --> 17:39.133
You've got to start somewhere.

17:39.298 --> 17:43.238
And to be perfectly honest with you.
your time is running out.

17:45.203 --> 17:47.973
You don't really wanna die.
do you. Hector?

17:50.841 --> 17:52.281
Come on.

17:55.846 --> 17:56.866
Thank you.

Guards.

-I'm fine.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.690
-Welcome back. Christine.
-Thank you. Mac.

18:07.690 --> 18:10.020
Hey. that stuff about a fair trial
still goes?

18:11.894 --> 18:14.124
Still goes. Hector.

18:14.297 --> 18:16.227
And don't worry. I'll be there with you.

18:17.399 --> 18:18.559
Thank you.

18:19.867 --> 18:23.697
-Christine.
-Thank you. Christine.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.770
She doesn't even let me call her
Christine.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.605
-Close call. huh?
-Yeah. tell me about it.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.812
Oh. did I break this thing?

18:40.719 --> 18:43.019
No. you pull that out
when you want it to explode.

18:43.187 --> 18:44.707
Oh.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.530
We can all relax now.

19:03.540 --> 19:06.130
It's a figure of speech. Christine.

19:15.684 --> 19:18.684
-I just have one question.
-Shoot.

19:19.221 --> 19:23.351
While I was unconscious and helplessly
sprawled on the cafeteria floor...

19:23.526 --> 19:25.956
...in a potentially compromising position--

19:26.128 --> 19:29.828
Dan was being held in leather restraints.

19:30.431 --> 19:32.921
Thank you.

19:33.735 --> 19:37.395
So. what made you come back?

19:39.541 --> 19:41.641
What made me come back?

19:43.311 --> 19:46.211
I guess it was that commitment
you mentioned.

19:46.781 --> 19:52.951
I realized that deep down in my heart.
that is why I took this job to begin with.

19:54.522 --> 19:57.512
We have to defend some pretty scummy
people in this profession...

19:57.692 --> 19:59.752
...but if we didn't....

19:59.928 --> 20:06.098
You know. one of my colleagues once said.
"We are the last bastion against fascism."

20:06.267 --> 20:08.557
I guess I really believe that.

20:10.036 --> 20:13.006
But mostly I came back
for the dental plan.

20:15.941 --> 20:18.911
You know. something else you said
made a difference too.

20:19.076 --> 20:21.976
Oh. yeah? What was that?

20:22.146 --> 20:26.336
Well. you told me to go home...

20:26.517 --> 20:29.207
...and take a nice warm bath.

20:29.386 --> 20:30.876
That?

20:32.590 --> 20:35.180
-That was nothing.
-No. no. no.

20:35.358 --> 20:39.798
That was one of the most chauvinistic...

20:39.963 --> 20:46.963
...sexist. demeaning comments
I've heard in a long time.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.232
See you.

20:57.179 --> 21:00.809
-Where are you going?
-To take a bath.

21:02.049 --> 21:05.579
And I'm going to let Dan watch.

21:13.394 --> 21:15.394
Well. she's kidding.

21:15.796 --> 21:16.916
I mean. she wouldn't.

21:17.098 --> 21:20.628

21:52.333 --> 21:54.273
Actually. I don't.

21:55.635 --> 21:57.925
I was just making small talk.

22:02.541 --> 22:04.071
...and I am flat broke.

Except for this 5 bucks Christine gave me
to shout. "Thank you."

22:13.351 --> 22:14.681
How much you need. Dan?

22:14.852 --> 22:17.882
Five thousand dollars.

22:19.121 --> 22:20.561
I'll give it to you.

22:20.723 --> 22:22.213
