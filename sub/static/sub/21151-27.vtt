GET ME OUT THAT EASILY.

00:21.222 --> 00:25.226

HOME GIRL CHRISTMAS, WHO IS NOT

00:35.236 --> 00:37.871
GOING TO PUT ME UP, AND I GET TO
SIT BECOME AND RELAX.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.540
>> I'M SORRY, PAUL.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.408
THAT'S WRONG.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.175
CHRISTMAS, CONGRATULATIONS.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.444
YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF

>> Announcer: ...JOSH HELPED
CHRISTMAS ZERO IN ON BACK-UP

00:54.054 --> 00:57.625
>> WHY WOULD JASON SAY I'M ON
THE FENCE WITH MARK WHEN HE PUTS

00:57.658 --> 00:58.492
MARK UP.

00:58.526 --> 01:02.130
WHY ARE YOU PLAYING WITH CODY
AND MARK?

01:02.163 --> 01:03.197
WHY?

01:14.442 --> 01:19.247
>> ALEX NO LONGER HAS JASON AS A
RIDE-OR-DIE, SHE NEEDS ME TO

01:19.280 --> 01:20.148
CONTINUE HER GAME FURTHER.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.716

SPRANG THE LIFE.

RODEOS IS GOING ON HERE?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.088
>> I DON'T KNOW.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.057
>> FIVE APPLES HANG FROM THE
TREE.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.926
YOU HAVE NO IDEA IF AN APPLE
CONTAINS A POWER OR A

01:32.960 --> 01:33.427
PUNISHMENT.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.028
>> YEAH.

01:35.062 --> 01:37.298
>> Announcer: AND MARK WAS
TEMPTED BY THE FRUIT, HOPING TO

01:37.331 --> 01:39.867
GET A POWER TO HELP HIM SURVIVE
THE WEEK.

01:39.900 --> 01:46.073
>> AN APPLE HAS BEEN PICKED FROM
THE TREE OF TEMPTATION.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.041
>> SAVE A FRIEND.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.578
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS IN THE

01:50.611 --> 01:53.281
HOUSE, BUT MAYBE I CAN STILL USE
THIS TO MY ADVANTAGE MOVING

01:53.314 --> 01:58.085
FORWARD.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.388
>> Announcer: BEFORE
NOMINATIONS MARK REVEALED WHOM

02:00.421 --> 02:01.622
HE WAS KEEPING SAFE.

>> PAUL, YOU GAVE ME FRIENDSHIP
WEEK ONE, THE LEAST I CAN DO,

02:04.858 --> 02:05.893
GIVE YOU SAFETY FOR A WEEK.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.861
>> THANK YOU.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.731
>> Announcer: WHILE CHRISTMAS
REVEALED HER PAWNS.

02:10.764 --> 02:15.536
>> I'VE NOMINATED YOU MATT AND
YOU JASON.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.906
IF MARK WINS THE VETO, I'VE
NOMINATED TWO PONCE, SO IF I

02:18.939 --> 02:21.342
DON'T GET MARK, I GET THE BREAK
UP ANOTHER POWER COUPLE.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.811
>> Announcer: TONIGHT WILL
MARK GET CHANCE TO SAVE HIMSELF

02:23.844 --> 02:26.113
WITH THE POWER OF VETO?

02:26.146 --> 02:28.182
>> WAKE UP, EVERYBODY!

02:28.216 --> 02:30.384
>> ZINGBOT?

02:30.418 --> 02:33.387
>> Announcer: ZINGBOT IS BACK,
AND HE'S MORE RUTHLESS THAN

02:33.421 --> 02:33.921
EVER.

02:33.954 --> 02:34.955
>> ZING, ZING, ZING.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.457
>> OH, THAT'S JUST MEAN.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.858
>> WHAT THE...

02:37.891 --> 02:40.294
>> Announcer: ALL THIS RIGHT
NOW ON "BIG BROTHER."

02:40.328 --> 02:42.062
>> OH, MY GOD.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.131
>> HE'S HAVING BABY.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.166
>> OH, BUDDY.

03:20.568 --> 03:26.274
Captioning funded by CBS
>> THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS

03:31.111 --> 03:34.682
ADJOURNED.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.250
DON'T RUN INTO ME.

03:36.284 --> 03:39.720
I NOMINATED MATT AND JASON AS
PAWNS IN ORDER TO BACK DOOR

03:39.753 --> 03:40.954
MARK.

03:40.988 --> 03:44.057
BUT IF MARK WINS THE VETO THIS
WEEK AND I CAN'T GET HIM OUT OF

03:44.091 --> 03:47.961
THIS HOUSE, THEN JASON IS MY
NUMBER-TWO TARGET AND HE'LL BE

03:47.995 --> 03:48.762
GOING HOME.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.298
>> I REALLY WAS NOT EXPECTING
THAT.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.532
>> IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.800
>> THANK YOU.

03:52.833 --> 03:56.937
>> I USED MY SAVE-A-FRIEND POWER
ON PAUL THIS WEEK BECAUSE HE'S A

03:56.970 --> 03:58.406
VERY POWERFUL PLAYER IN THE GAME
RIGHT NOW.

03:58.439 --> 04:02.175
HE'S GOOD WITH EVERYBODY AND
HE'S GREAT IN COMPETITIONS, SO

04:02.209 --> 04:04.111
HOPEFULLY THIS CAN BUILD SOME
GOODWILL BETWEEN US.

04:04.144 --> 04:07.881
>> LOOK, MARK, I KNOW THAT YOU
KNOW THAT I KNOW I WAS

04:07.915 --> 04:10.551
COMPLETELY SAFE THIS WEEK,
ESPECIALLY AFTER THREW THE

04:10.584 --> 04:11.785
H.O.H. COMPETITION.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.388
YOU PRETTY MUCH GOT A BIRTHDAY
GIFT YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT AND YOU

04:14.422 --> 04:17.891
SAVED IT AN REWRAPPED IT AND
GAVE IT TO ME, AND I STILL WANT

04:17.925 --> 04:20.594
YOU OUT.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.731
>> SO THIS IS MY THIRD TIME
GOING UP AS A PAWN.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.998
OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT FUN.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.769
IF MARK HAPPENS TO WIN THE VETO,
THEN BOTH MYSELF AND JASON WILL

04:28.802 --> 04:32.205
MOST LIKELY BE STUCK ON THE
BLOCK AND AT RISK OF BEING

04:32.239 --> 04:33.240
EVICTED.

04:33.273 --> 04:40.080
>> THE IS THE WAY YOU HUG IT OUT
AFTER A CEREMONY.

04:40.113 --> 04:48.389
>> THE THING IS THIS, IF HE GETS
IT, I THINK MATT'S GOING HOME.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.890
THEY'RE IN THE VOTING AGAINST
YOU.

04:49.923 --> 04:50.591
YOU CAN'T LOSE.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.593
>> THE TARGET THIS WEEK IS MARK.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.927
I'M FINE AS A PAWN.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.798
THE BLOCK DOESN'T SCARE ME TOO
BAD, BECAUSE I KNOW I GET TO

04:57.831 --> 04:58.699
PLAY IN THE VETO.

04:58.732 --> 05:10.744
SO I GOT THIS.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.082
>> FOUR TIMES.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.116
>> YEAH.

05:16.149 --> 05:22.390
WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW
CRAZY THIS SUMMER IS.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.091
I THINK SHE RUINED YOUR GAME.

05:24.124 --> 05:27.260
I MEAN, I RUINED MY OWN GAME.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.797
IT'S IN THE LIKE SHE LIED ABOUT
ANYTHING.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.131
I ALIGNED WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.501
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO BUT THE
LAUGH AT IT.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.404
>> I REALLY RESPECT THE WAY THAT
YOU HANDLE THINGS.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.507
I WISH MORE PEOPLE COULD HANDLE
IT THE WAY THAT YOU DID.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.675
>> YOU'RE A GOOD GUY, MARK.

05:41.709 --> 05:47.381
>> YOU GUYS ARE GOOD, TOO.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.149
THINK OF ME TOMORROW.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.553
>> GOOD NIGHT, MARK.

05:52.586 --> 05:56.189
>> I LIKE HIM SO MUCH.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.992
>> HE'S VERY GENUINE.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.260
>> YEAH.

06:00.293 --> 06:01.895
THERE'S A BIG PART OF ME THAT
LIKES MARK.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.131
I HAVE A BIG HEART FOR HIM.

06:04.164 --> 06:08.301
HE'S HAVING A HARD WEEK, AND I
CAN EMFA THESE WITH THAT A LOT.

06:08.335 --> 06:12.606
>>
IF HE WINS THE VETO, JASON IS

06:12.640 --> 06:15.609
GOING HOME.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.144
>> BREAK UP A SHOWMANCE.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.179
>> YEAH.

06:36.730 --> 06:41.201
>> SO OBVIOUSLY GET MARK OUT,
BECAUSE MARK WILL STIR THE POT

06:41.234 --> 06:42.235
AND MAKE THINGS DIFFICULT.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.971
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

06:44.004 --> 06:47.040
>> STRATEGICALLY WHAT OUR
BENEFIT HERE IS WE HAVE PEOPLE

06:47.074 --> 06:49.943
THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED,
WHICH IS THE DOPIEST THING.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.446
THE GIRL WHO BROKE HER LEG.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.213
>> THE NUT CASE.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.817
>> THE NUT CASE.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.185
>> I LOVE IT.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.020
>> EXACTLY.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.891
>> SO WHAT ARE WE THINKING TOP
FIVE?

07:03.924 --> 07:06.994
>> LAST SEASON I DIDN'T THINK
ABOUT THE END UNTIL THE END

07:07.027 --> 07:08.195
CAME.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.464
I NEED THE PICK PEOPLE THAT I
CAN BEAT BOTH IN COMPETITIONS

07:10.498 --> 07:15.268
AND BEAT WHEN IT COMES DOWN JURY
VOTING, AND HONESTLY, JOSH AND

07:15.302 --> 07:17.437
CHRISTMAS ARE NOT TERRIBLE
OPTIONS AT THIS POINT.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.239
>>
TAKE THIS

07:19.272 --> 07:24.845
INTO CONSIDERATION, DO WE WANT A
PAIR OR DO WE WANT KEVIN AS ONE

07:24.878 --> 07:25.946
OF THEM?

07:25.979 --> 07:28.749
A PAIR IS NOT GOOD BECAUSE IN
THE VETO THEY WILL SAVE

07:28.782 --> 07:31.151
THEMSELVES ALWAYS AND IT COULD
HURT ONE OF US.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.119
>> I WANT KEVIN.

07:32.152 --> 07:36.990
>> I DON'T THINK ALEX SHOULD GO
BEFORE JASON.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.827
>> YOU DON'T THINK SHE'LL TEAM
UP ON US?

07:39.860 --> 07:42.630
>> WHAT WILL SHE DO?

07:42.663 --> 07:44.031
SHE'S SINGLE.

07:44.064 --> 07:49.102
IF ALEX WINS H.O.H., WE HAVE HER
TAKE MATT OUT SO WE DON'T HAVE

07:49.136 --> 07:51.539
THAT ON OUR HANDS.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.174
SURE I HAVE A SIDE DEAL WITH
ALEX.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.977
BUT I CANNOT STAND UP AND
PROTECT ANYBODY AT THIS POINT

07:57.010 --> 07:59.813
BECAUSE EVEN IF I SHOW A LITTLE
BIT OF A FACT THAT I HAVE A

07:59.847 --> 08:02.516
SIDEKICK, I IMMEDIATELY PAINT A
HUGE TARGET ON MY BACK.

08:02.550 --> 08:07.087
WHAT I REALLY NEED RIGHT NOW IS
FOR THE TWO PAIRS, JASON AND

08:07.120 --> 08:09.156
ALEX, AND MATT AND RAVEN, TO
TAKE EACH OTHER OUT.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.925
>> SO US THREE, KEVIN AND RAVEN?

08:11.959 --> 08:13.627
>> I THINK SO.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.895
>> I FEEL GOOD WITH THAT?

08:14.928 --> 08:16.764
>> SO WE HAVE FIVE RIGHT NOW.

08:16.797 --> 08:17.998
FIVE IS SOLID.

08:18.031 --> 08:21.334
>> IF I CAN MAKE IT TO THE END
WITH JOSH, CHRISTMAS, RAVEN AND

08:21.368 --> 08:24.504
KEVIN, NOT ONLY DO I FEEL LIKE I
CAN SWEEP THE COMPETITION, BUT

08:24.538 --> 08:28.141
IF I LOSE, I'M CONFIDENT AT
LEAST A FEW OF THEM WOULD PULL

08:28.175 --> 08:28.809
ME UP IN A FINAL TWO.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.443
>> THIS COULD ACTUALLY WORK.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.880
>> PLEASE NONE OF YOU CRACK.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.849
YOU'VE BOTH PROGRESSED IN THE
GAME, IT'S LIKE WATCHING MY

08:35.883 --> 08:36.516
CHILDREN GROW.

08:36.550 --> 08:37.651
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE HERE.

08:37.685 --> 08:38.719
>> BELIEVE IT.

08:38.752 --> 08:41.589
YOU NEED THE TIE IN WITH ME AND
LET'S LOCK IT DOWN.

08:41.622 --> 08:42.856
>> LOCK IT IN.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.693
>> THEN I AIN'T LOCKING OTHERS
IN ANYMORE.

08:45.726 --> 08:53.967
I'M DONE.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.918
>> I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND THIS IS
A GAME AND ALL I NEED IS ONE WIN

09:10.951 --> 09:17.925
TO TURN AROUND THE HOUSE, HAVE
SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN, BUT JUST

09:17.958 --> 09:22.295
RIGHT NOW IN THIS MOMENT,
IT'S... IT'S VERY DIFFICULT, BUT

09:22.329 --> 09:30.904
I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN
TO WIN THE VETO AND STAY OFF THE

09:30.938 --> 09:31.805
BLOCK.

09:31.839 --> 09:45.552
IT'S JUST A VERY LONELY FEELING
RIGHT NOW.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.756
>> HEY, EVERYONE, IT'S TIME TO
PICK PLAYERS FOR THE VETO

09:48.789 --> 09:50.590
COMPETITION.

09:50.624 --> 09:59.700
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ONLY SIX PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE

09:59.733 --> 10:02.402
IN THE VETO COMPETITION, THE
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD, THE TWO

10:02.435 --> 10:06.139
NOMINEE, AND THREE OTHER PLAYERS
SELECTED BY RANDOM DRAW.

10:06.173 --> 10:10.678
WILL THE NOMINEES PLEASE JOIN ME
UP HERE?

10:10.711 --> 10:13.781
>> I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF
TALK ABOUT FUTURE GAME PLAY, BUT

10:13.814 --> 10:16.116
RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO FOCUS ON
THE MATTER AT HAND.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.918
THAT'S MARK GOING HOME.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.054
HE CAN'T GET PICKED THE PLAY THE
VETO, BECAUSE IT CAN THROW A

10:21.088 --> 10:22.355
WRENCH IN THE PLAN.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.724
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T PICK
MARK.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.459
>> I AS HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD AND
THE TWO NOMINEES WILL EACH PULL

10:26.493 --> 10:28.628
A CHIP OUT OF THE BOX TO
DETERMINE THE THREE OTHER

10:28.662 --> 10:30.197
PLAYERS COMPETING IN THE VETO
COMPETITION.

10:30.230 --> 10:41.408
AS H.O.H., I WILL PULL FIRST.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.344
HOUSEGUEST CHOICE.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.646
I PICK RAVEN.

10:46.680 --> 10:52.820
>> YAY, ME.

10:52.853 --> 10:57.290
>> I WAS PLANNING TO PICK PAUL
IF I GOT HOUSEGUEST CHOICE.

10:57.324 --> 11:02.930
I REALLY JUST HAD A BRAIN FART
BECAUSE HER BIG DOUGHY EYES WERE

11:02.963 --> 11:05.833
ABOUT TO BURST INTO TEARS IF I
DIDN'T PICK HER, SO I PICKED

11:05.866 --> 11:06.499
HER.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.969
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED.

11:09.002 --> 11:16.076
BLACKED OUT.

11:16.109 --> 11:21.248
>> HOUSEGUEST CHOICE.

11:21.281 --> 11:24.084
I CHOOSE PAUL.

11:24.117 --> 11:28.321
>> THERE'S ONLY ONE CHIP LEFT TO
BE PULLED, AND MY LIFE IN THIS

11:28.355 --> 11:31.124
HOUSE DEPENDS ON MY NAME GETTING
PICKED AND BEING ABLE TO COMPETE

11:31.158 --> 11:43.003
IN THIS VETO COMPETITION.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.504
>> MARK.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.373
>> OH, BABY.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.308
LET'S COMPETE.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.943
YES!

11:49.977 --> 11:52.312
I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF
COMPETITION IT IS, I'M GOING TO

11:52.345 --> 11:57.050
WIN THAT VETO.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.987
>> OH, GOSH, WORST-CASE
SCENARIO.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.455
AND I COULD BE THE TARGET AT
THIS POINT.

12:02.489 --> 12:09.629
IT'S CRITICAL THAT I GO OUT
THERE AND TAKE HOME THIS VETO.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.697

ABOUT IT REAL FAST.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.201
THEY HAVE SMALLER PLAYERS.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.642
I CAN'T BELIEVE ZINGBOT IS HERE.

15:09.676 --> 15:13.713
HE COMES IN THE HOUSE EVERY
YEAR, AND HE ROASTS PEOPLE.

15:13.746 --> 15:19.186

I'M THINKING, WHY IS EVERYONE
BOWING TO THIS ROBOT.

16:00.593 --> 16:04.064
I'M NOT GOING TO BOW TO YOU,
ZINGBOT.

16:04.097 --> 16:09.002
I DON'T WOW TO ANYBODY,
ESPECIALLY A ROBOT.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.137

CHRISTMAS, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU
WON'T BE ABLE TO HELP ZINGBOT

27:04.691 --> 27:07.694
FLOATING ZING WILL WIN THE
GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.228
BUT YOU HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE.

27:09.261 --> 27:14.667
YOU COULD CHOOSE TO RETRIEVE THE
ORB, WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO

27:14.701 --> 27:22.942
MAKE EIGHT TRIPS USING ZINGBOTS
SUPER SCOOPER.

27:22.975 --> 27:27.313
>> ON YOUR MARK, GET CELT, GO.

27:27.346 --> 27:37.023
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.091
>> I NEED TO WIN THE VETO.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.928
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN THE
HOUSE TO SUPPORT ME, AND IT'S

27:41.961 --> 27:43.329
WIN OR GO HOME.

27:43.362 --> 27:53.172
EVERY DROP OF THIS ZINCTROLEUM
IS MY LIFE IN THE HOUSE.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.808
>> RAVE, GOOD JOB, GIRL.

27:55.842 --> 28:02.114
>> I'M SO OUT OF IT.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.083
>> BE CAREFUL.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.818
>> OH, MY GOSH.

28:05.852 --> 28:08.420
>> COME ON, JASON, DO IT, DO IT,
DO IT!

28:08.454 --> 28:13.292
>> I FEEL LIKE THERE IS
SOMETHING FISHY GOING ON.

28:13.325 --> 28:16.195
CHRISTMAS MADE A REALLY WEIRD
CHOICE PICKING RAVEN, SO I'M

28:16.228 --> 28:18.397
GOING TO MAKE DANG SURE THEY WIN
THIS VETO.

28:18.430 --> 28:24.636
>> IT LOOKS LIKE JASON IS GOING
FOR THE SUPER SCOOPER.

28:24.670 --> 28:28.975
IT LOOKS LIKE RAVEN IS GOING FOR
THE SOONER SCOOPER.

28:29.008 --> 28:33.813
PAUL IS GOING FOR THE BIG TANK.

28:33.846 --> 28:42.955
IT LOOKS LIKE MARK IS GOING FOR
THE SUPER SCOOPER.

28:42.989 --> 28:46.258
>> BE CAREFUL, MARK.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.094
>> THIS VETO COMPETITION IS
SUPER IMPORTANT.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.228
MARK IS A HUGE THREAT.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.697
AND I GOT THE MAKE SURE THAT HE
LOSES.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.133
LAST YEAR WHEN I PLAYED THIS
COMPETITION, I WENT FOR THE

28:54.166 --> 28:57.503
SMALLER ONE TO GET THE BIG
SCOOPER, BUT I PRETTY MUCH JUST

28:57.536 --> 28:58.871
WASTED MY TIME AND BLEW IT.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.540
SO I DON'T WANT THE TAKE THAT
RISK THIS YEAR.

29:01.573 --> 29:06.145
I'M GOING TO GUN IT BACK AND
FORTH FOR THE BIG ONE.

29:06.178 --> 29:19.892
>> COME ON, PAUL, COME ON, CLAW
YOU WAY TO THE TOP.

29:19.926 --> 29:23.830
>> IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S CLOSE
BETWEEN PAUL AND MATT.

29:23.863 --> 29:27.599
>> THIS COMPETITION IS EXTREMELY
HARD, BUT I DEFINITELY WANT THE

29:27.633 --> 29:31.503
WIN THIS VETO COMPETITION TO
SECURE MY SAFETY AND TO ALSO

29:31.537 --> 29:34.173
MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SEND MARK
HOME THIS WEEK.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.375
>> COME ON, RAVEN.

29:36.408 --> 29:40.012
>> I REALLY WANT THE WIN THIS
VETO SO I CAN PULL MATTHEW OFF

29:40.046 --> 29:42.581
AND SECURE OUR SAFETY.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.916
>> RAVEN, ARE YOU OKAY?

29:43.950 --> 29:47.119
>> GOOD.

29:47.153 --> 29:51.357
BUT I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT WAS
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.424
>> OUCH.

29:52.458 --> 29:56.996
THAT'S GOTTA HURT.

29:57.029 --> 30:01.133
>> SUPER CUTE.

30:01.167 --> 30:05.704
>> YOU GOT IT, PAUL.

30:05.737 --> 30:07.073
>> HOLY SMOKES.

30:07.106 --> 30:11.110
THIS IS SO FUNNY TO SEE THIS
MEATBALL EAT IT.

30:11.143 --> 30:15.814
IT'S LIKE A PACK OF MEATBALLS
JUST FALLING ALL OVER.

30:15.848 --> 30:18.317
IT'S HILARIOUS.

30:18.350 --> 30:21.787
MEATBALLS ZING.

30:21.820 --> 30:27.193
>> EVERY TIME MARK FALLS, I'M
GETTING THE SHOCK WAVES.

30:27.226 --> 30:29.361
IT'S 7.0 ON THE RICTDER SCALE.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.262
ZING.

30:30.296 --> 30:31.597
>> COME ON, BUDDY.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.799
>> JASON, COME ON.

30:33.832 --> 30:37.236
>> BY ALL MEANS, TAKE YOUR TIME.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.371
I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

30:39.405 --> 30:43.642
>> I FEEL LIKE I PULLED AN ARM.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.578
>> WHAT THE HECK.

30:46.612 --> 30:54.553
>> I'M HAVING A PANIC ATTACK.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.497
>> RAVEN IS CLEARLY NOT GOING TO
HELP ME RIGHT NOW.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.300
SHE'S SPENDING MORE TIME FALLING
AND ON THE GROUND.

31:08.334 --> 31:11.337
SHE IS MOVING SLOWLY.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.340
SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO WIN THIS
VETO AND PULL MYSELF OFF THE

31:14.373 --> 31:18.244
BLOCK.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.179
>> THIS IS NOT MY COMPETITION.

31:20.212 --> 31:24.516
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THIS IS A VETO
THAT MY "BIG BROTHER" LIFE

31:24.550 --> 31:27.753
DEPENDS ON, BUT I'M NOT GIVING
UP, IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG

31:27.786 --> 31:31.357
UPHILL BATTLE, BUT THERE'S STILL
HOPE.

31:31.390 --> 31:35.161
>> ARE YOU OKAY, MARK?

31:35.194 --> 31:36.228
GOOD PUSH, MARK.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.330
GOOD BUSH.

31:38.364 --> 31:42.768
>> I AM ALMOST FULL WITH MY
LITTLE BOWL, AND PAUL IS

31:42.801 --> 31:45.837
PROBABLY JUST LESS THAN HALF-WAY
IN HIS BIG BOWL.

31:45.871 --> 31:48.074
I KNOW THAT THE BIG SCOOP IS THE
WAY TO GO.

31:48.107 --> 32:00.019
IT'S A GAMBLE, BUT I GOT TO WIN
THE VETO.

32:00.052 --> 32:03.022
>> AND JASON HAS EARNED HIS
SUPER SCOOPER.

32:03.055 --> 32:05.657
>> YOU GOT THE BIG ONE?

32:05.691 --> 32:06.858
>> YEAH.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.627
>> GOOD FOR HIM.

32:08.660 --> 32:12.364
>> SO I HAVE THE SUPER SCOOPER,
BUT YOU ONLY GET EIGHT TRIPS

32:12.398 --> 32:14.533
WITH THE BIG SCOOP.

32:14.566 --> 32:19.271
SO IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF
QUICK TRIPS, DOWN AND BACK, AND

32:19.305 --> 32:20.506
HOPEFULLY I CAN TAKE THE LEAD.

32:20.539 --> 32:24.943
>> THIS COMPETITION IS A MIXTURE
OF ENDURANCE, BALANCE, SPEED,

32:24.977 --> 32:26.278
AND NOT FALLING DOWN.

32:26.312 --> 32:30.816
SO YOU GOT TO REMEMBER, AS MUCH
AS THIS IS A RACE, IT'S ALSO

32:30.849 --> 32:33.085
MARATHON BECAUSE IN THE END, IF
YOU TIRE YOURSELF OUT, YOU'RE

32:33.119 --> 32:39.458
GOING TO LOSE.

32:39.491 --> 32:43.495
>> THAT LOOKED LIKE JASON MADE
GREAT PROGRESS WITH HIS EIGHT

32:43.529 --> 32:44.396
SCOOPS AND THAT'S IT.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.698
>> SO MY SOONER SCOOPER IDEA
WORKED GREAT.

32:46.732 --> 32:48.167
I GOT THE LEAD OVER PAUL.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.501
BUT NOW IT'S BACK TO THE FUNNEL.

32:49.535 --> 32:52.704
I WANT THE MAKE SURE I MAINTAIN
MY SPEED, AND IT WILL TAKE ME

32:52.738 --> 32:55.474
ALL THE WAY TO THE WIN.

32:55.507 --> 33:01.347
>> IT'S A THREE-WAY RACE BETWEEN
MATT, PAUL, AND JASON.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.315
>> IT'S OKAY, PAUL, YOU'RE OKAY.

33:03.349 --> 33:04.716
>> NICE WORK, PAUL.

33:04.750 --> 33:05.917
NICE WORK.

33:05.951 --> 33:09.521
>> I NEED YOU TO STEP IT UP,
PAUL, AND WIN THIS VETO, BECAUSE

33:09.555 --> 33:11.490
WE HAVE TO KEEP THE POWER ON OUR
SIDE.

33:11.523 --> 33:16.228
>> OH, MY GOSH.

33:16.262 --> 33:21.633
>> JASON IS IN FRONT WITH MATT
AND PAUL NOT FAR BEHIND.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.870
>> MARK IS DOING SO TERRIBLY AT
THIS POINT THAT MY JOB HERE IS

33:24.903 --> 33:26.672
DONE.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.075
IF JASON AND MATT WIN, THAT'S
PERFECT, BECAUSE THE LAST THING

33:29.108 --> 33:33.312
I WANT TO DO IS WIN THIS VETO
AND HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION

33:33.345 --> 33:39.385
BETWEEN MATT AND JASON AND
PISSs OFF BOTH OF THE COUPLES.

33:39.418 --> 33:41.720
>> JASON, GO FOR ANOTHER CUP.

33:41.753 --> 33:49.861
JUST GO FOR ANOTHER CUP.

33:49.895 --> 33:52.831
>> YOU DIDN'T FALL THE WHOLE
GAME.

33:52.864 --> 33:53.965
>> JASON WINS.

33:53.999 --> 33:59.271
>> WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT, WATCH
OUT, WATCH OUT.

33:59.305 --> 34:06.078
>> DOG PILE!

34:06.112 --> 34:10.982
>> CONGRATULATIONS, JASON.

34:11.016 --> 34:14.653
YOU HAVE WON THE POWER OF VETO.

34:14.686 --> 34:19.391
>> JASON, CONGRATULATIONS.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.827
>> CHEW ON THIS, ZINGBOT.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.895
THERE SHE IS, VETO.

34:23.929 --> 34:27.233
I'M PULLING MYSELF OFF THE
BLOCK, AND I'M GOING TO GO AND

34:27.266 --> 34:29.701
CHILL, BECAUSE I ACCOMPLISHED
BRUTAL.

34:29.735 --> 34:34.140
MY LEGS ARE KILLING ME, BUT IT'S
TOTALLY WORTH IT BECAUSE I GOT

34:34.173 --> 34:36.975
THIS BABY.

34:37.008 --> 34:39.978
>> NOW GO INSIDE.

34:40.011 --> 34:44.550
I'M SICK OF LOOKING AT YOU.

34:44.583 --> 34:48.086
>> IT SUCKS TO LOSE, ESPECIALLY
LOSE LIKE THAT.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.721
BUT I'M NOT ON THE BLOCK.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.691
SO IF I CAN TRY THE TALK THE
CHRISTMAS AND CONVINCE HER TO

34:52.724 --> 34:55.060
PUT SOMEBODY ELSE UP, I'M SAFE
FOR THE WEEK.

34:55.093 --> 34:57.129
I'M NOT SOMEBODY TO JUST ROLL
OVER AND DIE.

34:57.163 --> 35:00.065
>> THIS WEEK HAS GONE PERFECTLY
FOR ME.

35:00.098 --> 35:03.469
JASON WINS THE VETO AND PAINTS A
MASSIVE TARGET ON HIS BACK.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.538
MARK IS GOING TO GET BACK DOORED
AND HE'S GOING TO BE SENT OUT,

35:06.572 --> 35:09.908
AND I DON'T HAVE TO GET ANY
BLOOD ON MY HANDS AND I'M SAFE

35:09.941 --> 35:10.842
SO MATTER WHAT.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.845
IT SOUNDS LIKE A SUCCESSFUL WEEK
IN MY BOOK.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.081
>> THERE'S AN OPEN SPOT ON THE
BLOCK.

35:16.114 --> 35:19.618
AND ALTHOUGH MARK IS MY TARGET,
THERE ARE TWO PAIRS IN THE HOUSE

35:19.651 --> 35:20.452
THAT SHOULD BE SPLIT UP.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.488
I HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE.

35:39.137 --> 35:39.838
>> JASON IS EXTREMELY ANNOYED.

35:39.871 --> 35:43.709
>> YES, I AM, BUT I'M SO
EXTREME!

35:43.742 --> 35:45.644
THIS HELMET FEELS LIKE LEAD.

35:45.677 --> 35:53.018
I'M EXTREMELY FED UP WITH
CARRYING IT AROUND ALL DAY AND

35:53.051 --> 35:54.186
ALL NIGHT.

35:54.220 --> 35:59.024
NOT ONLY, THAT I AM 38 AND
BALDING, SO IT'S NOT GOOD TO BE

35:59.057 --> 36:02.861
WEARING A HEAVY HELMET AND
RUBBING MORE HAIR OFF THE TOP OF

36:02.894 --> 36:07.833
MY HEAD.

36:07.866 --> 36:08.934
>> WELL, WELL.

36:08.967 --> 36:12.638
>> I HATE THIS THING.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.306
I'VE DONE MY TIME.

36:14.340 --> 36:17.643
NOW GET ME OUT OF THE SUIT
BEFORE I RIP IT OFF.

36:17.676 --> 36:22.914
>> JASON, THAT WAS AN EXTREME
WEEK.

36:22.948 --> 36:23.782
GOOD JOB.

36:23.815 --> 36:29.821
YOUR PUNISHMENT IS EXTREMELY
OVER.

36:29.855 --> 36:30.989
>> YEAH!

36:31.022 --> 36:32.391
I CAN'T GET MY HELMET OFF.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.460
>> ONE MORE EXTREME, ONE MORE
EXTREME.

36:34.493 --> 36:35.494
>> OKAY.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.728
READY?

36:36.762 --> 36:37.195
READY?

36:37.229 --> 36:41.099
>> I'M SO EXTREME!

36:41.132 --> 36:51.777
[APPLAUSE]
[BUGLE BLOWING]

36:51.810 --> 36:54.446
>> ALEX, YOU HAVE BEEN A GREAT
CAMP GUIDE.

36:54.480 --> 37:00.252
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND
ALL YOUR DELICIOUS WIENERS.

37:00.286 --> 37:03.855
YOUR JOB IS DONE.

37:03.889 --> 37:07.593
>> I NEVER WANT TO SEE ANOTHER
HOT DOG, NOT ONE AT A STADIUM,

37:07.626 --> 37:10.529
NOT ONE AT A BIRTHDAY, NOT ONE
AT A PICNIC.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.131
I HATE HOT DOGS!

37:13.164 --> 37:15.267
NO MORE WIENERS EVER AGAIN.

37:15.301 --> 37:16.468
>> HOW DOES IT FEEL?

37:16.502 --> 37:23.409
>> IT FEELS GOOD.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.476
>> WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

37:24.510 --> 37:25.744
>> HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

37:25.777 --> 37:28.046
>> PERFECT, BOTH YOU GUYS UP
HERE.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.581
>> UNFORTUNATELY I LOST THE
VETO.

37:29.615 --> 37:32.217
I HAVE TO TRY TO CONVINCE
CHRISTMAS THAT SHE NEEDS ME IN

37:32.250 --> 37:33.218
THIS HOUSE.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.954
>> WELL, TOMORROW'S THE DAY.

37:35.987 --> 37:39.691
I JUST WANTED TO COME UP AND SEE
IF THERE WAS ANY DEALS OR FINAL

37:39.725 --> 37:42.994
WORDS I COULD SAY TO TRY TO
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

37:43.028 --> 37:48.567
>> YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY IN THE
HOUSE IS DIFFERENT.

37:48.600 --> 37:53.639
>> I AM ALL ALONE AND I AM
PLEDGING MY ALLEGIANCE TO YOU

37:53.672 --> 37:55.474
TWO IF YOU KEEP ME OFF THE
BLOCK.

37:55.507 --> 37:59.378
NOT ONLY THAT, THERE'S A BIG
MOVE THAT COULD BE MADE.

37:59.411 --> 38:03.949
THAT COULD HELP YOUR TWO CHANCES
OF GETTING $500,000.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.951
I KNOW I DON'T NEED TO SPELL IT
OUT FOR YOU.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.687
>> YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME MORE THAN
THAT, BUDDY.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.989
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME MORE.

38:11.022 --> 38:13.058
>> THIS STAYS HERE?

38:13.091 --> 38:15.193
>> YES.

38:15.226 --> 38:19.365
>> LOOK AT ALEX AND JASON.

38:19.398 --> 38:22.634
NOT ONLY ARE THEY WINNING, BUT
EVERYBODY LIKES THEM.

38:22.668 --> 38:23.068
THEY COMPETE.

38:23.101 --> 38:24.135
THEY GOT KEVIN.

38:24.169 --> 38:26.438
THEY MIGHT HAVE PAUL.

38:26.472 --> 38:27.839
I DON'T KNOW.

38:27.873 --> 38:33.011
IF I WAS IN YOUR GUYS SITUATION,
YOU SEND ALEX HOME, PROBABLY THE

38:33.044 --> 38:35.747
BIGGEST COMPETITOR IN THE HOUSE.

38:35.781 --> 38:39.785
IF -- SHE WINS, SHE COMPETES.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.388
IF SHE'S DOWN IN THE FINAL FOUR,
FINAL THREE, THERE'S A GOOD

38:42.421 --> 38:43.389
CHANCE SHE'S GOING TO WIN.

38:43.422 --> 38:46.291
YOU GUYS HAVE A HUGE
OPPORTUNITY, ESPECIALLY YOU,

38:46.324 --> 38:48.093
CHRISTMAS, TO MAKE THAT KIND OF
MOVE.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.828
I'M STILL GOING TO BE THE BIGGER
TARGET IN THE HOUSE.

38:49.861 --> 38:53.131
>> YOU HAVE A GOOD ARGUMENT.

38:53.164 --> 38:58.470
>> I KNOW IT'S A BIG SCARY
DECISION, BIG GAME MOVE, SO

38:58.504 --> 39:00.071
THANK YOU GUYS FOR HEARING ME
OUT.

39:00.105 --> 39:01.272
>> THANK YOU.

39:01.306 --> 39:07.946
>> ALEX IS A HUGE TARGET BECAUSE
SHE HAS JASON LOCKED IN, AND

39:07.979 --> 39:12.050
BETWEEN JASON AND ALEX, THEY CAN
DOMINATE H.O.H.s AND VETOES

39:12.083 --> 39:13.218
BACK-TO-BACK.

39:13.251 --> 39:15.086
THAT'S PRETTY DANGEROUS IN THIS
GAME.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.023
IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO TAKE HER
OUT SOONER THAN LATER.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.157
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

39:19.190 --> 39:23.529
>> I'M GOING THROUGH MY
CALCULATIONS.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.296
JALEX, THEY'RE A POWER DUO.

39:25.330 --> 39:28.467
WE NEED TO SPLIT THAT UP NOW.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.601
>> SHE CAN DO THIS.

39:29.635 --> 39:31.570
>> SHE'S MENTALLY UP FOR IT.

39:31.603 --> 39:34.105
>> SO WHY WOULDN'T WE GET RID OF
HER NOW?

39:34.139 --> 39:34.606
WHY WOULDN'T WE?

39:34.640 --> 39:35.441
>> YEAH.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.476
YEAH.

40:06.404 --> 40:20.385
>> HEY, EVERYBODY, IT'S TIME FOR
THE VETO MEETING.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.988
THIS IS THE VETO MEETING.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.524
MATT AND I HAVE BEEN NOMINATED
FOR EVICTION, BUT I HAVE THE

40:25.557 --> 40:29.127
POWER TO VETO ONE OF THOSE
NOMINATIONS.

40:29.160 --> 40:38.236
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE POWER
OF VETO ON MYSELF.

40:38.269 --> 40:42.474
SO CHRISTMAS, SINCE I HAVE
VETOED ONE OF YOUR NOMINATIONS,

40:42.508 --> 40:45.176
YOU HAVE TO NAME A NEW
HOUSEGUEST AS A REPLACEMENT

40:45.210 --> 40:48.980
NOMINEE.

40:49.014 --> 40:52.751
>> SO MARK, FIRST NIGHT THEY WAS
ON THE BLOCK, YOU SAID YOU WOULD

40:52.784 --> 40:56.254
VOTE FOR ME IF I COULD DO YOU
FAVOR LATER, SINCE THEN WE'VE

40:56.287 --> 40:59.290
HAD LOTS OF UPS AND DOWN, LAST
NIGHT I LISTENED TO YOUR

40:59.324 --> 41:07.966
CAMPAIGN TO STAY IN THE HOUSE,
AND WITH THAT, I FEEL LIKE MY

41:07.999 --> 41:11.503
OBLIGATION TO YOU HAVE BEEN
FULFILLED, SO NOW I NOMINATE YOU

41:11.537 --> 41:21.580
AS A REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

41:21.580 --> 41:26.685
AS A REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

41:26.718 --> 41:34.860
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

41:34.893 --> 41:38.764
>> AS HARD AS THIS IS FOR ME
RIGHT NOW.

41:38.797 --> 41:40.098
I'M NOT DEAD YET.

41:40.131 --> 41:41.833
I CAN STILL CHARM A FEW PEOPLE.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.001
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.703
I HAVE NEVER GIVEN UP ON
ANYTHING.

41:44.736 --> 41:47.105
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

41:47.138 --> 41:51.943
>> SO I'M TRYING TO PITCH IN AND
DO MY PART, BUT I'VE GOT TO BE

41:51.977 --> 41:54.746
HONEST, BEING ON THE BLOCK IS
STARTING TO GET PRETTY DARN OLD.

41:54.780 --> 41:57.015
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START
GETTING IDEAS AND THEY MIGHT

41:57.048 --> 42:00.418
JUST TAKE A SHOT AT ME, WHICH IS
PRETTY SCARY.

42:00.451 --> 42:02.621
>> FINALLY MARK'S UP ON THE
BLOCK.

42:02.654 --> 42:05.190
WE GOT TO MAKE THE RIGHT MOVE
THIS WEEK AND GET HIM OUT OF THE

42:05.223 --> 42:06.291
GAME.

42:06.324 --> 42:08.694
IT'S GETTING DOWN TO THE
NITTY-GRITTY, AND NOW I GOT TO

42:08.727 --> 42:09.995
PUT MY MIND IN MOTION.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.698
EVERYBODY HAS 2 START FIRING AT
EACH OTHER, AND HOPEFULLY I CAN

42:12.731 --> 42:15.333
SIT ON THE SIDELINES AND WATCH
THE FIREWORKS.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.103
>> I NEEDED TO PUT MARK ON THE
BLOCK.

42:18.136 --> 42:21.339
WHOEVER WAS IN POWER, HE'S
PLEDGED HIS LOYALTY TO.

42:21.372 --> 42:24.643
FRANKLY, HIS LOYALTY IS POOP.

42:24.676 --> 42:28.146
HOWEVER, HAVING MATT ON THE
BLOCK IS VERY TEMPTING, BECAUSE

42:28.179 --> 42:31.049
I DEFINITELY NEED TO START
STRIKING AT THE POWER COUPLES

42:31.082 --> 42:32.517
WHEN I CAN.

42:32.550 --> 42:35.120
THIS MAY BE TOO GOOD OF A SHOT
NOT TO TAKE.

42:35.153 --> 42:39.024
>> WHO WILL BE EVICTED FROM THE
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE, MATT OR

42:39.057 --> 42:40.191
MARK?

42:40.225 --> 42:47.132
FIND OUT THURSDAY AT 9:00, 8:00
CENTRAL ON "BIG BROTHER."
