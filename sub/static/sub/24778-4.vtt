00:21.543 --> 00:22.761
I'd like you to
write down everything

00:22.805 --> 00:24.372
that you learned
in Los Angeles.

00:24.415 --> 00:27.723
Children go to school.
Adults work.

00:27.766 --> 00:31.379
And then there are no
electronics of any kind.

00:36.645 --> 00:38.777
- A RAP.
- It's online.

00:38.821 --> 00:41.867
- Your enemy is coming here.
- Yes.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.695
- What will they do
when they get here?

00:43.739 --> 00:46.089
- Total annihilation.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.134
- God.

00:54.663 --> 00:57.318
- My department was responsible
for running analytics

00:57.361 --> 00:58.493
on the dark web.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.324
- Monitoring bot nets
and arms dealers.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.239
- Nothing that specific.

01:06.153 --> 01:09.199
We were trying to figure out
the shape of this thing.

01:09.243 --> 01:12.637
But that was a waste of time.
It was just chaos.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.161
- And that's when you
hired the kid.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.597
- Yeah.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.252
Some hotshot who was supposed
to get his feet wet

01:18.295 --> 01:22.430
in my department before
he moved on to bigger things.

01:22.473 --> 01:25.868
Then he got curious.
Started tinkering.

01:25.911 --> 01:29.306
It was all hidden
in plain sight.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.308
Extra data packets
attached to everything

01:31.352 --> 01:33.745
that moved across
the deep web.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.794
- No way to tell.
It was totally encrypted.

01:38.837 --> 01:43.538
The thing is, the volume
of information was enormous.

01:43.581 --> 01:46.889
Almost 40% of everything
we were intercepting.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.592
I brought it to my bosses.

01:54.636 --> 01:59.293
Two days later, the kid dies
in a traffic accident.

01:59.336 --> 02:03.862
And then I get promoted
to a different desk.

02:03.906 --> 02:06.474
I'm not the most political guy,
but even I got the picture.

02:11.435 --> 02:14.960
- We're going up against a vast
intergovernmental conspiracy.

02:15.004 --> 02:17.441
The most powerful people
in the world

02:17.485 --> 02:18.747
are betraying
the rest of us.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.575
- I got that from your website.

02:20.618 --> 02:23.317
What I don't understand is,
why are they doing this?

02:23.360 --> 02:24.318
Aren't they already in charge?

02:24.361 --> 02:26.276
- The kid--

02:26.320 --> 02:28.887
he tried to crack the codes on
the encrypted packets, right?

02:28.931 --> 02:29.932
- Yeah.

02:29.975 --> 02:31.455
But he ran into a brick wall.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.283
He said it was like
nothing he'd ever seen.

02:33.327 --> 02:35.459
- As if the code had been
designed by an intelligence

02:35.503 --> 02:38.158

- I built this place
before the Arrival.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.902
- Bet this made for a nice
mountain getaway back then.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.643
- Hmm.

17:16.905 --> 17:21.866
I was picked up on some
trumped-up charge,

17:21.910 --> 17:25.305
so I skipped bail
and I dug in here.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.959
The evidence against the Clicks
was overwhelming,

17:28.003 --> 17:30.875
but some people would
rather be blind than see.

17:30.919 --> 17:32.051
- Not us.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.835
- Hmm.

17:33.878 --> 17:37.056
The reason that this camp
has survived for so long

17:37.099 --> 17:39.275
is that the people
who remain fall in line

17:39.319 --> 17:41.016
behind a singular vision.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.278
- Yours.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.237
- Revolutions aren't won
by committee.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.066
- No, but they're won
with smart strategy.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.894
Which requires accurate
intelligence gathering.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.636
We have the enemy in our hands;
I can't think of one reason

17:52.680 --> 17:54.116
why we wouldn't
want to question it,

17:54.160 --> 17:56.031
find out more about
what we're fighting.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.207
- Because every word that comes
out of that thing's mouth

17:58.251 --> 18:00.122
is poison.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.950
- We'll never know what's true

18:01.993 --> 18:03.734
unless we keep
asking it questions.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.780
- We have information that
might corroborate

18:05.823 --> 18:08.043
what the Click was saying
about the other species.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.698
A ship crashed in the mountains
in Northern California

18:10.741 --> 18:12.134
while we were making
our way north.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.701
- I saw that in your notebook.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.094
- And your scout
saw it too.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.359
- We stumbled upon
an escape capsule.

18:19.402 --> 18:23.145
I don't know what was inside,
but it was not a machine.

18:23.189 --> 18:27.193
- I saw that in your notes too,
but there is no corroboration.

18:28.150 --> 18:31.110
- Well, all of this lines up
with other things that we know.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.373
We've heard that the Clicks
are using the Factory

18:33.416 --> 18:36.985
to build a huge defensive grid
to shield themselves

18:37.028 --> 18:39.814
and us
from whatever else is coming.

18:41.163 --> 18:44.993
- You see, I did not see
that detail in your notes.

18:47.474 --> 18:50.172
- Do you expect me to just
give you everything?

18:50.216 --> 18:51.739
- Yes.

18:51.782 --> 18:55.438
- Well, there's more.
If we can work together.

18:58.485 --> 19:01.792
- I invited you both here
this morning

19:01.836 --> 19:03.098
because I hoped that we could

19:03.142 --> 19:05.013
come to some kind of
understanding.

19:05.056 --> 19:08.930
But you must realize that I
have provided food and shelter

19:08.973 --> 19:10.192
for both you and your children.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.325
It's a taste of civilization.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.283
- If you care about
the war you're fighting,

19:14.327 --> 19:17.156
then destroying that Click
would be a huge mistake.

19:17.199 --> 19:21.203
- The people who stay here
succeed because they understand

19:21.247 --> 19:22.813
that there is a line
that must be towed.
