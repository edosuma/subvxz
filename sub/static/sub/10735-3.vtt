15:46.623 --> 15:51.378
Max: It means we're
getting close. Blast it.

15:51.420 --> 15:53.589

15:55.507 --> 15:57.134
Oh.

Patelliday?!

16:19.364 --> 16:23.118
Max: Told you he
could handle himself.

16:26.914 --> 16:29.917
[ panting ] We're gonna need
everything we've got to stop

16:29.958 --> 16:32.669
these robot-pirate guys.
- Ben: What are they up to?

16:32.711 --> 16:37.674
Well, they... it'll come
to me, once I let it ruminate.

16:37.716 --> 16:40.344
Max: He's a ruminator.

[ sonar pinging ]

16:56.860 --> 16:58.987
Full power!

17:05.702 --> 17:07.496
Just a few more ships, and this

17:07.538 --> 17:10.624
set of Earth vessels is complete
and ready for sale.

17:10.707 --> 17:11.875
[ crash ]

17:11.916 --> 17:12.792
<i>Aw, nuts!</i>

17:12.792 --> 17:15.503
I wasn't quite done ruminating.

17:17.214 --> 17:20.800
Ben: Magister Patelliday wanted
to figure out your plan for himself.

17:20.800 --> 17:25.638
Got to say, I was expecting
something a bit more... hm...

17:25.638 --> 17:28.559
Rook: Impressive.
- Impressive?!

17:28.642 --> 17:31.562
I'm stealing boats and putting
them in giant bottles!

17:31.645 --> 17:33.188
I could have sworn he was

17:33.230 --> 17:35.983
planning some kind of universal
hostage situation.

17:36.066 --> 17:38.819
Max: Don't be so hard on
yourself, Patelliday.

17:38.861 --> 17:40.737
He's still dangerous.

17:40.821 --> 17:45.284
Ben: Your...
ship-bottling days are... over!

17:45.367 --> 17:47.661
Take them, my mechaneers!

[ Omnitrix beeps ]

17:51.915 --> 17:54.751

We can do this the hard way ...

17:54.835 --> 17:57.004
Diamond hard!

18:11.059 --> 18:14.688
Ha ha!
A nod to tradition.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.325
Diamondhead: What about the
people on those boats?

18:26.408 --> 18:27.576
Ha harr!

18:27.618 --> 18:30.329
They're getting a free trip
across the galaxy!

18:30.370 --> 18:31.121
Ha ha!

18:31.163 --> 18:36.335
These boats are worth a fortune
to certain galactic collectors.

18:36.418 --> 18:38.587
[ beeping ]

18:41.256 --> 18:43.300
Diamondhead: But those
bottles are sealed.

18:43.342 --> 18:46.220
They're all gonna run out of air.

18:46.261 --> 18:48.972
<i>It is a hostage situation!</i>

18:49.014 --> 18:51.934
Max: Hear that?
Not much time.

18:51.975 --> 18:53.852
Take them!

19:11.203 --> 19:15.249
Reminds me of that weekend
that we took out Cassiopeia way,

19:15.290 --> 19:18.502
you and Xylene, me and
Appida Lou.

19:18.544 --> 19:20.170
Max: Patelliday?
- Yeah, Max?

19:20.212 --> 19:24.800
Max: Duck!
- Leg sweep! Yeeaw!

19:24.800 --> 19:28.804
What's keeping you, newbie?
The air in those bottles is getting stale!

19:28.804 --> 19:30.472
Rook: Right away, magister.

19:30.514 --> 19:32.683
[ computer beeps ]

19:43.986 --> 19:47.447
That's it!
Prisoners liberated!

19:51.827 --> 19:53.829
Uh-Oh.
What have you done?!

19:53.829 --> 19:57.332
Diamondhead: Nothing you
didn't have coming.

20:02.379 --> 20:04.548
[ rumbling ]

20:48.550 --> 20:52.095
<i>Wrap this up, boys.
I want to see if the fish are still bitin'!</i>

20:52.137 --> 20:54.681
Diamondhead: Nope.
No more fish.

20:54.723 --> 20:57.851
You're out of luck.
You'll never get the ships out

20:57.893 --> 21:01.396
before your humans run out of air!

21:15.494 --> 21:19.957
Rook: Looks like this fishing
trip has caught us a whale.

21:19.998 --> 21:23.126
Oh, no!
- Ben: Terrible.

21:23.168 --> 21:25.316
Rook: W-why was it terrible?

21:25.317 --> 21:27.464
Max: He means it was a groaner.

21:27.506 --> 21:30.425
Rook: I-I, um ... a "groaner"?
