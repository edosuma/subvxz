00:13.195 --> 00:15.096
Who ate my fudgy pops?

00:15.097 --> 00:17.309
- Not me.
- Not me neither.

00:17.395 --> 00:19.529
You stinky liar, Mort.

00:19.530 --> 00:23.151
It's written all your face. Delicious
milky chocolate.

00:23.152 --> 00:27.233
Why Mort? Why did you eat my fudgy pops?

00:27.242 --> 00:29.809
Aaah! April Fools!?

00:29.810 --> 00:32.829
It's August, Mort. April Fools' ain't
gonna fly.

00:33.129 --> 00:37.624
Ehh Maurice, what is this 'April
Fyu-ools' you speak of?

00:37.625 --> 00:39.315
You've never heard of April Fools?

00:39.316 --> 00:41.889
Well, have you ever heard of, erm...

00:41.890 --> 00:44.612
... January Jacks? No! You have not!

00:44.613 --> 00:46.665
Maybe because you just made that up.

00:46.666 --> 00:48.868
What? That is so ... Okay, you got me
there.

00:48.869 --> 00:51.092
But Christmas Steve, he's real!

00:51.598 --> 00:52.342
Really.

00:52.345 --> 00:55.331
Steve knows if I've been bad or good.

00:55.469 --> 00:57.555
And that's creepy.

00:58.561 --> 01:00.769
April Fool is when you pull pranks on
people

01:00.770 --> 01:02.434
and they don't get mad because you say

01:02.435 --> 01:04.156
"April Fools".

01:04.382 --> 01:07.526
Ohohho! I like this concept. I will try
it!

01:07.527 --> 01:09.854
Sorry! It only works on April 1st.

01:09.855 --> 01:14.341
What? Come on! I didn't know about April
fooling up till just now, you know.

01:14.342 --> 01:18.527
So, I get to make up for all of the
'foolings' I've missed.

01:18.528 --> 01:21.273
Peanuts? For me?

01:26.465 --> 01:29.490
Did I mention that they are jalepeno
peanuts?

01:29.491 --> 01:32.518
Also, did I mention "April Fools"?

01:32.519 --> 01:35.621
Come on Maurice, stand on the 'X'.

01:35.622 --> 01:37.651
Something might happen.

01:37.652 --> 01:39.795
Maybe a nice surprise.

01:39.796 --> 01:41.414
You don't know. Try it.

01:41.415 --> 01:43.495
No! I'm not standing on the 'X'.

01:43.496 --> 01:44.944
I'll do it!

01:45.122 --> 01:47.199
Oh, no! Mort!

01:49.892 --> 01:51.219
I'm coming for you, buddy.

01:52.768 --> 01:53.879
April Fools.

01:54.568 --> 02:00.413
Men, our intel says a 2 ton shipment of
battery-fresh atlantic cod

02:00.414 --> 02:04.001
will pass by the zoo gates at precisely
1400 hours.

02:04.002 --> 02:08.276
- Kowalski!
- Operation Snare the Cod will require
steady flippers,

02:08.277 --> 02:11.452
laser-like focus and, of course, a sober
resolve.

02:11.453 --> 02:16.042
Help! Help! An alligator is having me
for lunch!

02:16.043 --> 02:18.965
- That's Julien!
- Roger's gone carnivore!

02:18.966 --> 02:20.314
Roll out, men!

02:21.429 --> 02:22.609
What the...

02:22.672 --> 02:24.684
- Please Help!
- Ringtail!

02:26.474 --> 02:29.857
Actually, I'm having this alligator for
lunch! Ha Hah Ha!

02:30.260 --> 02:31.313
April Fools.

02:31.314 --> 02:32.654
Wait a second here.

02:32.655 --> 02:36.123
You just invited me over so that you
could prank the penguins?

02:36.124 --> 02:38.087
But of course, Roger.

02:38.088 --> 02:43.403
You didn't think that I'd actually want
to dine with reptile riff-raff, did you?

02:43.404 --> 02:45.085
I ought to eat you!

02:45.128 --> 02:46.801
That's what I ought to do.

02:47.156 --> 02:49.829
Oh ho! That was like a double April
fools. Aha!

02:49.962 --> 02:51.895
I'm in the zone, baby!

02:52.290 --> 02:54.908
Ringtail, it's not April 1st!

02:54.909 --> 02:56.209
Silly penguin.

02:56.210 --> 02:59.509
It's always April 1st somewhere.

02:59.510 --> 03:02.980
You have no idea how a calendar works,
do you?

03:03.530 --> 03:05.089
The Julien Calendar.

03:05.090 --> 03:07.686
Pictures of me, looking adorable, on
top.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.410
Random numbers on the bottom.

03:09.411 --> 03:12.318
My favourite month is Julienuary.

03:12.802 --> 03:14.390
(sighs) Pack it in, boys.

03:15.471 --> 03:16.736
Where was I?

03:16.814 --> 03:19.288
- Erm, laser-like focus.
- Right, right.

03:19.292 --> 03:23.581
As I was saying, Operation Snare the Cod
will require steady flippers

03:23.582 --> 03:25.542
laser-like focus, and a sober res...

03:25.543 --> 03:30.553
Help me! Penguins! I'm in desparate need
of some genuine helping!

03:30.570 --> 03:30.623
(groans)

03:34.494 --> 03:36.104
RINGTAIL!

03:36.546 --> 03:37.874
April fools!

03:37.985 --> 03:39.282
Gotcha! Ha Ha Ha Ha!!

03:40.187 --> 03:44.373
So help me, you prank us again, and you
won't see next April.

03:44.374 --> 03:46.280
Okay, okay.

03:46.281 --> 03:51.569
I won't call for you again unless I
absolutely have to.

03:56.538 --> 03:58.262
Steady flippers, laser-like focus, and a
sober...

03:58.263 --> 04:01.080
Help! Penguins, please!

04:01.081 --> 04:02.687
I'm on fire!

04:05.893 --> 04:07.003
It's a prank. Ignore it.

04:07.004 --> 04:09.060
But what if it really is an emergency?

04:09.061 --> 04:10.733
It's not! I'm certain.

04:10.734 --> 04:12.631
Help! This is no joke!

04:12.632 --> 04:14.675
- 90%.positive.
- Come, quickly!

04:14.676 --> 04:16.216
Okay, maybe 85.

04:16.216 --> 04:18.327
- I cannot last much longer. - 70%.

04:18.327 --> 04:20.569
Hellllllp!

04:20.815 --> 04:22.165
Let's go.

04:23.481 --> 04:24.900
Ringtail?

04:27.661 --> 04:30.439
Yes! I am on fire!

04:30.440 --> 04:33.575
With these awesome April Fools pranks!

04:33.965 --> 04:36.737
You should see your face right now.

04:36.755 --> 04:39.880
Oh! it's all mean and stuff, like this.

04:43.518 --> 04:45.356
That's it! No more!

04:45.357 --> 04:48.806
I have prepared a counterprank plan
featuring crank calls,

04:48.807 --> 04:50.676
itching powder and faux vomit.

04:50.677 --> 04:53.293
Escalation, Kowalski? Negatory.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.849
That'll play right into Ringtail's sick
plan.

04:56.674 --> 04:59.939
But, skipper, he keeps exploiting our
altruistic instincts.

04:59.940 --> 05:02.190
I don't think I can help helping.

05:02.191 --> 05:03.401
Right you are, men.

05:03.402 --> 05:05.109
That's why we need to begin...

05:05.110 --> 05:06.329
prank resistance training.

05:35.584 --> 05:36.815
Hey!

05:36.816 --> 05:38.461
What are you doing?

05:38.462 --> 05:41.930
Hey eh, you moved. You ruined the
picture.

05:41.931 --> 05:42.915
The picture?

05:42.916 --> 05:47.050
Yeah, I tagged you with a rude drawing,
in permanent marker.

05:47.455 --> 05:50.070
- It's great.
- You, you what?

05:50.071 --> 05:52.742
Yeah, I call it butt-ffiti.

05:54.119 --> 05:56.831
You are going to pay for this, lemur.

05:56.832 --> 05:58.544
Oh, please, Roy.

05:58.545 --> 06:02.277
It's April Fools. I have diplomatic
immunity.

06:02.717 --> 06:04.534
And it's not April!

06:04.677 --> 06:07.790
Men, I threw every gag in the book at
you.

06:07.791 --> 06:10.710
Whoopee cushions, joy buzzers, and wet
willies.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.092
[shudders] That was my least favorite.

06:13.093 --> 06:14.932
But you persevered.

06:14.933 --> 06:18.488
Congratulations, you've completed your
prank resistance training.

06:18.489 --> 06:19.538
[all cheer] Woo-hoo!

06:19.539 --> 06:22.024
I'm proud of you boys.

06:22.025 --> 06:23.820
Got a little schmutz there, Private.

06:24.139 --> 06:25.582
Just a friendly reminder...

06:25.583 --> 06:28.019
pranks can happen any time, any place.

06:28.020 --> 06:28.805
Stay frosty.

06:28.906 --> 06:31.609
Sorry, Skipper. It won't happen again.

06:31.610 --> 06:33.095
Don't sweat it, young Private.

06:33.096 --> 06:34.775
Seriously, though, you got a little
something....

06:34.776 --> 06:37.084
Come on, Private. we just went over
this!

06:37.085 --> 06:38.128
Sorry, Skipper. Sorry, sorry.

06:38.129 --> 06:39.708
Head in the game, man.

06:39.709 --> 06:42.860
Now, all joking aside, a little stain
right there.

06:42.968 --> 06:44.694
Private, a little stain?

06:45.554 --> 06:50.165
Did you see the color those chameleons
turned when I tied their tongues
together?

06:50.759 --> 06:53.405
It has got to be the best April
Foolishness, EVER.

06:53.406 --> 06:56.130
Okay, but maybe it's time to give it a
rest.

06:56.131 --> 07:00.087
Uh, Maurice, I know this is hard for you
because of your bounteous bottom,

07:00.088 --> 07:01.821
but lighten up, dude.

07:03.841 --> 07:05.750
Your Majesty, are you all right?

07:05.751 --> 07:08.797
The bouncy is lacking... the bounce.

07:09.351 --> 07:11.147
Someone poked a hole in it.

07:11.148 --> 07:14.805
But who would do such a thing to someone
as beloved as me?

07:18.150 --> 07:21.131
Next hole I punch is through you.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.901
- Do you suppose it was him?
- Yup, I think it was him.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.305
Private, I said little stain!

07:27.306 --> 07:28.651
Right there!

07:30.956 --> 07:32.205
- Penguins!
- Whew!

07:33.950 --> 07:38.806
Help me! The rhino, he wants to skewer
my fleshy parts.

07:38.807 --> 07:41.600
Why... that sounds... like a prank.

07:41.601 --> 07:43.706
What's your game this time, Ringtail?

07:43.707 --> 07:45.701
"Kick me" sign? The hotfoot?

07:45.702 --> 07:47.913
Or is our refrigerator running?

07:47.914 --> 07:50.980
Well, if it is, you better catch it...
He he!

07:51.351 --> 07:54.784
No! No, no! I am not being the April
Fool.

07:54.785 --> 07:57.331
Do we look stupid to you?

07:57.342 --> 08:00.825
Ehh! Well, your brow is a bit... heavy.

08:02.248 --> 08:07.151
Whaaat? I didn't even mention your
ridiculous "wings".

08:12.313 --> 08:14.712
"Roy's out to get you". Yeah, right.

08:14.713 --> 08:17.497
You're just pulling another mean prank
on me.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.561
Actually, if I was pulling another prank
on you, I'd do this.

08:20.589 --> 08:21.818
Eek! A mouse!

08:22.114 --> 08:24.551
[screams] Where? Where's the mouse?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.682
Good thing I didn't do that.

08:35.046 --> 08:37.414
I know you're there, lemur.

08:37.426 --> 08:39.434
Oh! Hello. He He!

08:40.020 --> 08:43.207
Just keep that aside, I'm all done with
the pranks,

08:43.207 --> 08:45.736
unless, of course, it's really
hilarious. He He!

08:46.934 --> 08:49.030
Or done done. That works too.

08:49.031 --> 08:52.808
You'll never play another prank again,
buddy boy.

09:01.543 --> 09:02.876
Friendly observation:

09:02.877 --> 09:05.520
You're letting anger dominate your life.

09:09.903 --> 09:11.754
Hehehe! You cannot reach me.

09:11.755 --> 09:14.230
All I need to do is keep running up here

09:14.231 --> 09:16.991
forever, and you will never... Oh Goddd!

09:20.929 --> 09:24.967
I'm begging you. Please do not give me
the sharp end of your...

09:27.058 --> 09:28.149
Skipper!!

09:28.150 --> 09:29.940
Sleep grenades, fire!

09:37.871 --> 09:39.741
Sweet dreams, friend.

09:39.742 --> 09:42.723
Well, Ringtail, I hope you've learned
your lesson.

09:42.724 --> 09:46.365
Yes, I've learned that you will rescue
me,

09:46.366 --> 09:49.344
no matter how jerky I am to you.

09:49.345 --> 09:50.507
That's not the lesson!

09:50.508 --> 09:52.280
Really? Thought I had it.

09:52.563 --> 09:55.827
Uh, then it must be "A stitch in time
saves nine".

09:55.828 --> 09:58.404
- No, that's not it either.
- Okay.

09:58.707 --> 10:01.457
Saves eight? Or ten, perhaps. maybe an
even number.

10:01.458 --> 10:03.228
You're not even close!

10:03.954 --> 10:05.656
Umm... Always... No wait!

10:05.657 --> 10:07.483
Never... No wait.

10:07.484 --> 10:12.284
Sometimes... I don't... Look if you want
this to be a growing experience for
me...

10:12.285 --> 10:13.925
Ringtail!

10:20.395 --> 10:25.114
Oh! Why? Why did this happen to someone
who is so young

10:25.115 --> 10:27.499
and fluffy... and...

10:27.698 --> 10:28.825
plush?

10:28.826 --> 10:30.586
April Fools, Ringtail!

10:31.942 --> 10:34.058
Sweet, switcheroo, Kowalski.

10:34.059 --> 10:36.047
In your lemury face!

10:41.464 --> 10:43.451
I'm telling Christmas Steve on all of
you!

10:43.452 --> 10:45.420
Creepy!

10:45.768 --> 10:48.413
Aah! Felt good to turn the tables,
didn't it, Private?

10:48.414 --> 10:49.760
Sure did.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.617
Oh! You've got a loose fluff in there,
Skipper.

10:51.640 --> 10:51.867
Ha Ha!
