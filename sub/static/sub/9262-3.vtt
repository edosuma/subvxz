WEBVTT

00:08.007 --> 00:09.641
There's a bug hidden,
this will find it.

00:09.642 --> 00:12.843
- <i>That's unnecessary.</i>
- <i>Tell it to the feds.</i>

00:14.000 --> 00:20.074

00:28.828 --> 00:31.329
<i>Heard about the city's</i>
<i>new top 10 gang list?</i>

00:31.330 --> 00:34.199
They're holding a spot
for the local Armenian kingpin.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.533
Feds would like
to beat them to it.

00:35.534 --> 00:37.969
Since the Kesakhians are gone,
guess that means you.

00:37.970 --> 00:40.038
It's safe.
You're wasting your time.

00:40.039 --> 00:42.340
Up until now
we've been slow dancing.

00:42.341 --> 00:45.210
<i>If we're gonna slip into bed,</i>
<i>I'm gonna need some protection.</i>

00:45.211 --> 00:49.580
So I got a real job, so anytime
you wanna get started.

00:49.581 --> 00:53.251
<i>Your job will have
to wait. Got something you need to do.</i>

00:53.252 --> 00:56.354
<i>It better be something quick.</i>
<i>I've got a lot on my plate.</i>

00:56.355 --> 00:59.391
Your department is about to
destroy its confiscated guns.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.093
Yeah, it's an annual thing.
We want them.

01:02.094 --> 01:03.661
Well, I'm sure
the SWAT team guarding

01:03.662 --> 01:05.997
that shipment won't have
a problem with me taking a few.

01:05.998 --> 01:08.433
The guns are stored
before they're moved.

01:08.434 --> 01:10.401
Find out where,
and get to them first.

01:10.402 --> 01:13.371
Look, you want guns,
you can get them anywhere else.

01:13.372 --> 01:16.241
Those guns have been
processed. Cleaned.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.343
Thanks to your city,
they're untraceable now.

01:18.344 --> 01:20.444
Yeah, well, I gotta
pass on this favor.

01:20.445 --> 01:21.946
You have no choice.

01:21.947 --> 01:24.082
I don't need a choice.
Answer's no.

01:24.083 --> 01:27.919
You just killed your friend
and his family.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.322
You know what?
Go ahead, kill Mackey.

01:30.323 --> 01:31.656
<i>Kill his whole family.</i>

01:31.657 --> 01:34.058
<i>I'm not going on some career</i>
<i>suicide mission for you.</i>

01:34.059 --> 01:35.293
<i>I'm not gonna spend</i>
<i>my life</i>

01:35.294 --> 01:37.395
with somebody else's debt
around my neck either.

01:37.396 --> 01:39.997
You said that we would be
compensated for our loss.

01:39.998 --> 01:42.968
How about saving your ass
in county jail, huh?

01:42.969 --> 01:46.371
That slip your mind?
Money compensation.

01:46.372 --> 01:47.605
<i>Those guns</i>
<i>are a down payment.</i>

01:47.606 --> 01:49.007
<i>They're a tall order.</i>

01:49.008 --> 01:51.443
I need fair market value
for the risk I'll be taking.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.844
I'll come up
with something.

01:52.845 --> 01:55.279
You gotta tell me what you need
these gats for.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.282
We'll move them out of state.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.618
That's all you need to know.

02:06.825 --> 02:08.526
Interesting strategy.

02:08.526 --> 02:11.362
"Kill his whole family."

02:11.363 --> 02:13.899
It's the smartest thing
we've done with these assholes.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.167
I gave us a chance
to end all of this.

02:16.168 --> 02:18.636
By putting a truckload
of untraceable weapons

02:18.637 --> 02:20.404
in the hands
of God knows who?

02:20.405 --> 02:23.274
I put us in a place, finally,

02:23.275 --> 02:25.510
to ensuring that
your kids stay alive.

02:25.511 --> 02:27.478
By letting
innocents get killed--

02:27.479 --> 02:28.914
We don't know that.

02:28.915 --> 02:31.016
Look, Rezian's
negotiating with us now.

02:31.017 --> 02:34.186
We still don't know who knows
about my money train debt.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.754
I don't see him volunteering
that anytime soon.

02:36.755 --> 02:38.523
We have no choice.

02:38.524 --> 02:40.057
Until we figure out
exactly

02:40.058 --> 02:43.528
how deep the threat
against my family goes,

02:43.529 --> 02:44.795
we gotta play ball
with them.

02:44.796 --> 02:46.163
So all we gotta do

02:46.164 --> 02:48.333
is hijack the department's
annual PR bonanza.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.702
Maybe we don't have
to steal the guns,

02:50.703 --> 02:53.171
maybe somebody
gives them to us.

02:53.172 --> 02:56.575
Yeah, how's that?
I got a card to play.

03:17.830 --> 03:21.165
Morning.

03:21.166 --> 03:24.002
You shouldn't have come here.
Where's our black mailbox?

03:24.003 --> 03:25.870
The one we're supposed
to access together?

03:25.871 --> 03:28.039
I knew you couldn't resist
the temptation to use it

03:28.040 --> 03:29.707
for your own purposes.

03:29.708 --> 03:31.375
The very fact that
you're here proves it.

03:31.376 --> 03:32.710
So you took it?
Yeah.

03:32.711 --> 03:34.545
I'm in control of it,
until the time is right

03:34.546 --> 03:36.413
to turn it over to justice.

03:36.414 --> 03:38.483
I'm in the middle of something.
I don't have time to--

03:38.484 --> 03:40.518
Hey, we're still
working together.

03:40.519 --> 03:44.055
The only change is that I'm
now in possession of the box.

03:44.056 --> 03:45.590
We're close
to drawing Pezuela

03:45.591 --> 03:47.392
out of his hole
and into the light of day.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.060
And that only works
if he thinks

03:49.061 --> 03:50.495
the box is still
out there.

03:50.496 --> 03:53.064
And that
hasn't changed.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.533
Look,
if Pezuela's smart,

03:55.534 --> 03:58.102
he hasn't had any contact
with anyone in that box.

03:58.103 --> 04:01.306
So I have to link him
directly to the cartel.

04:01.307 --> 04:03.742
Or all you're doing is
giving the feds ammunition

04:03.743 --> 04:07.178
to destroy the careers
of everyone in that box.

04:07.179 --> 04:10.882
Before one of them has a chance
to save your job, right?

04:15.921 --> 04:18.389
When you finally
turn it back over to Justice,

04:18.390 --> 04:20.690
they're gonna wonder
what took you so long.

04:20.692 --> 04:23.727
I was trying to understand
exactly what I had,

04:23.728 --> 04:25.029
determine who put
it all together.

04:25.030 --> 04:27.131
I could tell them that.

04:27.132 --> 04:29.434
Or I can tell you're
just another dirty politician

04:29.435 --> 04:31.536
trying to extort his way
to the mayor's office.

04:31.537 --> 04:33.771
You'd only be
incriminating yourself.

04:33.772 --> 04:36.841
Yeah, but I'm
on the way out.

04:36.842 --> 04:39.110
You can still
maintain the lie,

04:39.111 --> 04:41.913
keep yourself
distanced from all this.

04:41.914 --> 04:45.049
That is, if I'm willing to tell
the right story on that day.

04:45.050 --> 04:48.519
Don't look for the box.
You won't find it.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.788
I don't need the box.

04:50.789 --> 04:52.824
I have you.

04:59.265 --> 05:01.199
How'd that play out?
It didn't.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.068
It's gonna happen
the hard way.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.003
Did you find out where
the guns are stored?

05:05.004 --> 05:07.304
Department's kept them
in five different locations.

05:07.305 --> 05:08.807
They're about
to get roasted.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.375
They gotta be
in the same place now.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.377
Yeah, the question is,
which one?

05:12.378 --> 05:13.344
It might seem obvious,

05:13.345 --> 05:15.280
we start asking
before the guns get jacked.

05:15.281 --> 05:17.048
If we're gonna take this risk,

05:17.049 --> 05:19.150
we gotta know that we have
a deal with Rezian.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.659
Who is this?
Vic Mackey.

05:33.532 --> 05:34.899
Why is he here?

05:34.900 --> 05:36.834
If you want those guns,
I can't do it alone.

05:36.835 --> 05:39.603
Now, he's got more motivation
to succeed than anybody.

05:39.604 --> 05:41.605
Going after my family
got my attention.

05:41.606 --> 05:43.641
But I'm gonna defend them
one way or the other.

05:43.642 --> 05:45.576
He stole from us once.
Why trust him?

05:45.577 --> 05:46.811
You shouldn't.

05:46.812 --> 05:48.179
I took your
money train cash,

05:48.180 --> 05:50.582
and I'm not afraid to come here
and tell you about it.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.650
But we both know I just stole
what you already stole.

05:52.651 --> 05:53.951
You and who else?

05:53.952 --> 05:57.088
Me, my buddy Lem, who's dead,

05:57.089 --> 05:59.323
and two of his homies
from out of town.

05:59.324 --> 06:01.626
I couldn't find them now
if I wanted to.

06:01.627 --> 06:04.028
But Shane and Ronnie,
they had nothing to do with it.

06:04.029 --> 06:05.630
Maybe we just
kill you then.

06:05.631 --> 06:08.233
The footchopping generation's
dead and buried.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.435
You filled the vacuum,
but you're new.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.303
You're consolidating
power,

06:12.304 --> 06:14.572
and you've got a Mexican threat
you don't understand

06:14.573 --> 06:16.307
and can't defend yourself
from.

06:16.308 --> 06:19.944
Then you can give us
our money back.

06:19.945 --> 06:22.079
Sorry.
We burned through the money.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.083
But I can offer a, uh, solution
that benefits us all.

06:25.084 --> 06:27.085
- End this now.
- First,

06:27.086 --> 06:28.719
I need to know where
the guns are headed

06:28.720 --> 06:30.588
once we've delivered them.

06:30.589 --> 06:32.489
They're going
to Chicago by train.

06:32.490 --> 06:35.259
We need to see a light
at the end of this tunnel.

06:35.260 --> 06:38.329
So instead of the 2 million
that I don't have,

06:38.330 --> 06:41.132
I'm gonna grant you
three wishes.

06:41.133 --> 06:43.435
The guns can be
wish number one.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.402
Use your wishes well,

06:44.403 --> 06:46.805
be a lot more valuable
than the missing cash.

06:46.806 --> 06:49.640
But once you've had
your three meals,

06:49.641 --> 06:51.709
we walk away
from the table

06:51.710 --> 06:53.878
fat, happy and even.

06:53.879 --> 06:55.479
He doesn't give us terms.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.815
The talk is, your war with
the Mexicans is heating up.

06:57.816 --> 07:00.084
Now, you're gonna need
more help, more intel--

07:00.085 --> 07:01.485
Don't listen to this.

07:01.486 --> 07:05.155
Trust me or not,
that's your best offer.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.169
Rezian is buying it
for now.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.638
But Khalulian's gonna
be nothing but trouble.

07:20.639 --> 07:23.507
I know. First, we'll get
the guns out of storage.

07:23.508 --> 07:25.877
After that we'll find out
exactly where they're going.

07:25.878 --> 07:28.079
Who cares where they're going?
I care.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.348
Look, the Armenians want guns,
they're gonna get them.

07:31.349 --> 07:33.818
If not from us,
from someplace else.

07:33.819 --> 07:35.052
But the most important thing
is,

07:35.053 --> 07:36.921
I have finally
found us a light

07:36.922 --> 07:39.023
at the end of
this goddamned tunnel.

07:43.162 --> 07:46.631
Hey.
What can I do for you guys?

07:46.632 --> 07:49.968
Well, you can help me
save my partner's ass.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.037
We-- We had a gun that should
have been stored in Evidence.

07:53.038 --> 07:55.540
Somehow my partner
let it slip into the pile

07:55.541 --> 07:57.675
headed for the Smith & Wesson
weenie roast.

07:57.676 --> 08:00.644
And now the asshole who wounded
two people in a robbery

08:00.645 --> 08:02.647
got himself a retrial.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.548
We need the gun back.
I'm sorry, you're too late.

08:04.549 --> 08:06.784
Guns aren't supposed to
be destroyed for two days.

08:06.785 --> 08:08.987
True, but they're locked up
at the impound yard

08:08.988 --> 08:10.421
over on San Fernando
right now.

08:10.422 --> 08:11.723
Maybe we can
still get to it.

08:11.724 --> 08:14.459
There's almost 8000
loose guns in that pile.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.761
Think you're gonna find
one serial number in all that?

08:16.762 --> 08:19.330
Shit. Yeah.

08:19.331 --> 08:21.499
The DA'll have
to get by on his charm

08:21.500 --> 08:24.268
instead of limping by
on forensics.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.576
Steve, there's a girl here
about a missing person.

08:31.577 --> 08:32.943
So give her
the paperwork.

08:32.943 --> 08:34.679
She filled it out yesterday.

08:34.679 --> 08:35.913
There's some new information.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.914
I'm about to jump
into something else.

08:37.916 --> 08:40.784
What, the crossword puzzle?
Jumble, actually.

08:40.785 --> 08:42.953
Give it to Dutch.
If it's got legs I'll hop on.

08:42.955 --> 08:46.324
Dutch, there's a young
woman outside. Marisol Griego.

08:46.325 --> 08:49.160
Some missing girl
is her friend, Wan Lee, 16.

08:49.161 --> 08:51.563
Sixteen? Try runaway.

08:51.564 --> 08:54.265
You think your friend Wan
was abducted?

08:54.266 --> 08:57.068
I was meeting her after school
to get something to eat.

08:57.069 --> 08:59.437
She passed me on her scooter,
trying to park.

08:59.438 --> 09:03.440
I saw somebody, a man,
push her into an SUV.

09:03.441 --> 09:05.809
An officer called
Wan's mother yesterday.

09:05.810 --> 09:08.746
Was told she wasn't missing.
She said it was a mistake.

09:08.747 --> 09:11.715
Wan hasn't been at school.

09:11.716 --> 09:13.517
She missed a midterm today.

09:13.518 --> 09:16.153
Sometimes kids
don't wanna go to school.

09:16.154 --> 09:18.990
Wan's 4.0. She wants
to go to Stanford.

09:18.991 --> 09:22.226
Something happened to her.

09:27.933 --> 09:30.802
Mrs. Lee?
I'm Detective Wagenbach.

09:30.803 --> 09:33.204
Are you, uh, Wan Lee's
mother?

09:33.205 --> 09:34.939
A friend of Wan's

09:34.940 --> 09:37.742
is concerned she hasn't heard
from her in a couple of days.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.644
I already spoke
to the police.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.345
I told them
there was no problem.

09:41.346 --> 09:43.981
I still have a missing
person's report on file.

09:43.982 --> 09:46.184
If I could just talk
to her, close it out.

09:46.185 --> 09:48.486
She's not here.
Where is she?

09:48.487 --> 09:50.221
Come back
when my son is home.

09:50.222 --> 09:53.324
Uh, well, I'd rather
do this now.

09:53.325 --> 09:55.059
She went away
for a few days.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.361
Okay, well, why
don't we call her?

09:57.362 --> 10:00.364
Y-you'll have
to talk to my son.

10:00.365 --> 10:03.134
Mrs. Lee, is everything
all right?

10:03.135 --> 10:05.703
If something's happened--
There's nothing wrong.

10:05.704 --> 10:08.405
We don't need your help.
Thank you.

10:21.587 --> 10:24.088
Says Wan's not missing,
just went away for a few days.

10:24.089 --> 10:26.323
I'd rather spend
the limited time I have

10:26.324 --> 10:29.460
investigating actual crimes.
Mother's scared, covering.

10:29.461 --> 10:32.029
If you'd gotten your ass out of
the car, you'd have seen that.

10:32.030 --> 10:33.831
How about I just
take your word for it

10:33.832 --> 10:35.366
and we end
this field trip?

10:43.909 --> 10:46.510
Hey, Vic. I'm on San Fernando.

10:46.511 --> 10:49.680
If we can get in,
we can drive right out.

10:49.681 --> 10:50.948
Guns must be
in the main warehouse,

10:50.949 --> 10:52.917
where they keep
those expensive rides.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.919
Nothing like
a tricked-out Benz.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.621
And Rezian was right
about one thing.

10:56.622 --> 10:58.889
Until the cameras roll,
these guns are nothing

10:58.890 --> 11:00.458
but the department's
garbage.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.193
Got one guard inside.

11:02.194 --> 11:03.828
<i>Guy couldn't protect</i>
<i>his own asshole.</i>

11:03.829 --> 11:06.230
That makes sense.
Budgets are tight all around.

11:06.231 --> 11:09.066
<i>Hey, you remember that,</i>
<i>uh, dealer we used once,</i>

11:09.067 --> 11:11.769
<i>blew a hole in his wall</i>
<i>for that--? That murder case?</i>

11:11.770 --> 11:13.437
What was his name?
Burnout, wasn't it?

11:13.438 --> 11:15.006
<i>Yeah, that sounds right.</i>
<i>Why?</i>

11:15.007 --> 11:17.275
<i>Well, I saw him driving</i>
<i>a few days ago.</i>

11:17.276 --> 11:19.443
Guy got himself
a brand-new Escalade.

11:19.444 --> 11:21.446
<i>Business must be good.</i>

11:21.447 --> 11:24.549
All right, I'll track him down
and get back to you.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.417
Why the mysterious
invite?

11:26.418 --> 11:29.754
We've been working a local
Armenian crew from the inside.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.055
Our CI tipped us off

11:31.056 --> 11:34.057
about a major gun heist
that's about to land.

11:34.058 --> 11:35.392
You want in on it?

11:35.393 --> 11:37.562
Think it's as good
as your last lead?

11:37.563 --> 11:38.863
Sounds like it's better.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.865
Probably took a
lot of time and effort

11:40.866 --> 11:42.099
to get your man
in so deep.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.968
Anybody else would keep
that lid screwed on

11:43.969 --> 11:45.135
as tight as possible.

11:45.136 --> 11:47.304
Yeah, well,
I'm not anybody else.

11:47.305 --> 11:48.305
No.

11:48.306 --> 11:49.974
No, you're one
of those rare cops

11:49.975 --> 11:51.576
who likes to share
his spoils.

11:51.577 --> 11:54.245
We're all fighting
the same war, right?

11:55.880 --> 11:57.781
My father always warned me,

11:57.782 --> 12:01.052
a boy does you one favor,
maybe he's just nice.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.553
But if he does you
two favors,

12:02.554 --> 12:04.621
he's either trying to put
his hand on your wallet

12:04.622 --> 12:05.823
or down your panties.

12:05.824 --> 12:06.757
I'll bet your daddy

12:06.758 --> 12:08.826
had to beat the boys
away with a stick.

12:08.827 --> 12:12.830
Louisville Slugger, actually,
and he wasn't afraid to use it.

12:12.831 --> 12:15.633
And no one's gonna
hang anything over my head.

12:15.634 --> 12:17.101
So if you think sharing
a couple busts

12:17.102 --> 12:19.636
gives you the right
to something, think again.

12:19.637 --> 12:21.405
In case you
haven't heard,

12:21.406 --> 12:23.741
I'm not exactly appreciated
around here.

12:23.742 --> 12:26.010
Department's trying
to force me out.

12:26.011 --> 12:27.912
So I'm gonna clear away
as much shit off the street

12:27.913 --> 12:29.447
as I can before I go.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.315
And I don't give
a rat's ass

12:31.316 --> 12:33.150
who gets
the credit for it.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.255
Still want in
on this or not?

12:42.694 --> 12:44.996
Hey, captain.

12:44.997 --> 12:46.197
How you doing?

12:47.432 --> 12:49.033
Busy. Wanna tell me

12:49.034 --> 12:50.935
what you wouldn't tell
the desk sergeant?

12:50.936 --> 12:53.237
This guy Larry, he's been
coming into my porn shop

12:53.238 --> 12:54.672
wanting to
invest in my films.

12:54.673 --> 12:56.106
Who could blame him?

12:56.107 --> 12:57.608
I know about Larry.

12:57.609 --> 13:01.078
His main thing is drugs, only
pays his actresses in coke.

13:01.079 --> 13:02.946
Of course,
I threw him out.

13:02.947 --> 13:05.549
Because you commit your smut
to a higher standard?

13:05.550 --> 13:07.418
You interested
in a drug-peddling,

13:07.419 --> 13:09.854
money-laundering asshole?

13:12.057 --> 13:14.725
What happened in the meetings?
Showed him my product.

13:14.726 --> 13:16.160
He wasn't interested.

13:16.161 --> 13:18.228
It's not my fault
he can't appreciate

13:18.229 --> 13:20.464
the mature female body
the way I can.

13:20.465 --> 13:22.833
What kind of stuff
did he wanna invest in?

13:22.834 --> 13:26.370
Uh, um.... Guy-girl,
girl-girl, threeway.

13:26.371 --> 13:28.105
ATM. Black on white.

13:28.106 --> 13:31.142
If you ever get tired of
squashing people's civil rights,

13:31.143 --> 13:32.643
I can make you
some real money.

13:32.644 --> 13:33.911
So far this is working out.

13:33.912 --> 13:35.680
If something changes,
I'll let you know.

13:35.681 --> 13:38.348
You call Larry,
and set another meeting.

13:38.349 --> 13:40.184
Outside?

13:44.555 --> 13:47.391
You fold Tina in with you
as bait.

13:47.392 --> 13:49.026
You want us to set up
on the porn guy?

13:49.027 --> 13:50.561
Sounds like more
of a Vice thing.

13:50.562 --> 13:53.564
It's a drug thing. Larry's
got to get his someplace.

13:53.565 --> 13:55.766
Follow the coke trail
where it leads to.

13:55.767 --> 13:57.068
Where's Vic and Shane?

13:57.069 --> 13:58.603
Uh, Vic had a CI
that reached out.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.437
He and Shane
are following up on it.

14:00.438 --> 14:04.242
Well, if you need bodies,
get them back.

14:17.389 --> 14:19.390
I'm gonna need to see
some ID, Burnout.

14:19.391 --> 14:21.325
Mackey? What I do, man?

14:21.326 --> 14:23.293
License.

14:30.301 --> 14:32.336
Registration.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.978
That's a nice ride.
Thank you.

14:40.979 --> 14:42.780
I'm afraid I have to
take you in for driving

14:42.781 --> 14:44.648
without a license
and registration.

14:44.649 --> 14:46.550
You got both of them
in your goddamn pocket.

14:46.551 --> 14:47.918
You start talking back,

14:47.919 --> 14:50.187
we're gonna have to add
a resisting charge.

14:53.825 --> 14:55.626
Really nice ride.

14:55.627 --> 14:58.896
Make the introductions and shut
up. We'll take it from here.

14:58.897 --> 14:59.730
Everybody ready?

14:59.731 --> 15:01.565
Thought we
were meeting up with Vic?

15:01.566 --> 15:04.401
What, we can't handle it?
- You okay?

15:04.402 --> 15:05.803
Yeah, I'm feeling
my groove.

15:05.804 --> 15:07.471
Wait for him
to offer the drugs.

15:07.472 --> 15:10.440
Don't ask or be vague
or else it becomes entrapment.

15:10.441 --> 15:12.610
I was listening
the first time.

15:12.611 --> 15:15.313
Glad to hear it.
Let's go.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.781
About time you got
out of that old granny shit.

15:17.782 --> 15:18.815
Glad you approve.

15:18.816 --> 15:20.184
How many scenes you done,
hon?

15:20.185 --> 15:21.685
I've only done a couple

15:21.686 --> 15:23.554
of home ones
with Devon.

15:23.555 --> 15:26.824
But I just got into town
a few days ago, is that okay?

15:26.825 --> 15:28.025
<i>Yeah, it's okay.</i>

15:28.026 --> 15:29.393
Who's Devon?

15:29.394 --> 15:31.729
I'm her boyfriend. We're hoping
to break in together.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.797
Mm.

15:33.798 --> 15:37.535
Small, but natural.

15:37.536 --> 15:38.969
You done anal yet,
sweet thing?

15:38.970 --> 15:40.838
Um, I'm waiting
for the right material.

15:40.839 --> 15:42.939
I was thinking we could
do a few scenes

15:42.940 --> 15:44.909
until she got
more comfortable.

15:44.910 --> 15:48.745
All right, hon, get naked.
Let me see how you suck it.

15:48.746 --> 15:50.814
Axl didn't mention
free samples.

15:50.815 --> 15:52.283
This is an audition.

15:52.284 --> 15:57.020
Yeah, well, Axl had said
that he had been to you before

15:57.021 --> 16:00.056
and that he always came back
empty-handed.

16:01.426 --> 16:03.360
Look, I don't get laid
unless I get paid.

16:03.361 --> 16:05.162
This already
feels different.

16:05.163 --> 16:07.865
I gotta know what my
money's buying, okay?

16:07.866 --> 16:10.700
What's the problem, baby?
I'm just a little nervous.

16:10.701 --> 16:14.071
Need something
to help you get in the mood?

16:14.072 --> 16:16.941
Yeah, okay.
What do you got?

16:16.942 --> 16:20.044
- You got a stage name?
- Persuasion.

16:22.347 --> 16:25.582
- You like that?
- Yeah, I like that.

16:29.688 --> 16:33.057
Those give you an erection
that lasts more than four hours.

16:33.058 --> 16:34.925
Call me
so I can film it.

16:34.926 --> 16:39.129
And this bag of powder means
I get to tap that ass too.

16:40.298 --> 16:42.399
Welcome to the world
of adult entertainment.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.135
Police. You're under arrest.

16:47.139 --> 16:50.374
Natural but small.

16:58.717 --> 17:01.051
I don't wanna touch until
the techies run through it.

17:01.052 --> 17:02.453
Sure thing.

17:02.454 --> 17:05.255
Just dump it at Farmington.
I'll check it out there.

17:05.256 --> 17:07.558
Luxury vehicles
get parked at San Fernando.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.593
Department regulation.

17:09.594 --> 17:11.395
Wherever.

17:20.137 --> 17:21.605
Asshole.

17:21.606 --> 17:24.207
You know,
the way this cocaine is packaged,

17:24.208 --> 17:25.275
small quantities,

17:25.276 --> 17:27.743
buys you a
distribution charge.

17:27.744 --> 17:29.480
I don't sell it.
I give it away.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.415
It gets a better performance
out of the girls.

17:31.416 --> 17:34.117
Then you bought it
from somebody. Who?

17:38.256 --> 17:39.623
Demetrius Harms.

17:39.624 --> 17:41.424
Well, there's no sense
you taking the hit

17:41.425 --> 17:43.861
if it's Harms we want.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.429
You're done now.
Get lost.

17:45.430 --> 17:47.431
Someone gonna take me back
to my store?

17:47.432 --> 17:49.833
Call a uni to haul him back
to his place. Just get him out.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.269
Okay. Come on.

17:54.739 --> 17:58.309
What do you say, Larry?
You wanna help yourself out?

18:05.016 --> 18:07.051
Is your son home?
No.

18:07.052 --> 18:09.954
We went by his market on the
way over here. It's closed.

18:09.955 --> 18:12.957
Mrs. Lee, was Wan kidnapped?
Wan is not missing.

18:12.958 --> 18:14.825
I wanna bring
Wan home safely,

18:14.826 --> 18:17.361
but you're gonna have
to help me help her.

18:18.363 --> 18:19.730
Wan!

18:24.302 --> 18:26.269
You're Wan?

18:28.773 --> 18:30.007
Where should I take her?

18:30.008 --> 18:33.176
Just go up the stairs.
Any open interrogation room.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.384
Wan, Wan, Wan.

18:41.385 --> 18:43.219
You're gonna have to wait.

18:43.220 --> 18:44.822
My sister--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:44.823 --> 18:46.924
Ms. Johnson from Child
Protective Services

18:46.925 --> 18:48.525
explained your rights.

18:48.526 --> 18:51.461
You're just gonna have
to be patient. I'm sorry.

18:51.462 --> 18:52.930
Right this way,
please.

18:52.931 --> 18:54.932
Hey, uh, feel free
to sit in.

18:54.933 --> 18:56.299
Dutch.
Yeah.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.401
Maybe I should be the one
to talk to her.

18:58.402 --> 19:00.838
I don't know.
She seems really shut down.

19:00.839 --> 19:03.641
I think it should be
girl to girl.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.443
Y-you trusted a hunch.
Trust mine?

19:06.444 --> 19:09.045
I promise you,
I'm just trying to help you.

19:09.046 --> 19:10.781
Then let me go home.

19:10.782 --> 19:13.684
I will as soon as we sort out
where you've been.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.686
I'm here now.
What difference does it make?

19:15.687 --> 19:17.587
I think that
you were kidnapped.

19:17.588 --> 19:19.590
I think your mom
paid the ransom.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.191
So you're calling me
a liar?

19:21.192 --> 19:23.427
I think
you're hiding something.

19:23.428 --> 19:25.562
Listen, Wan, I know
you're tired, okay?

19:25.563 --> 19:28.164
I'm gonna let you go,
but...

19:28.165 --> 19:30.901
Just answer one thing
for me, okay?

19:30.902 --> 19:34.171
If you weren't taken,
what are you so mad about?

19:34.172 --> 19:36.573
<i>And don't tell me it's</i>
<i>because I won't let you leave,</i>

19:36.574 --> 19:38.075
<i>because I heard you're</i>
<i>a nice kid.</i>

19:38.076 --> 19:40.844
<i>I mean, you're a good student.</i>
<i>Straight A's.</i>

19:40.845 --> 19:42.379
<i>You wanna go</i>
<i>to Stanford, right?</i>

19:42.380 --> 19:44.982
I mean, you have everything
working for you.

19:44.983 --> 19:47.751
So, what are you
so mad about?

19:54.092 --> 19:55.325
<i>What if I were
to tell you</i>

19:55.326 --> 19:57.694
<i>something about me</i>
<i>that nobody else knows?</i>

19:59.831 --> 20:02.132
A few days ago,
I was working on a case.

20:02.133 --> 20:05.635
We were arresting
some really dangerous people.

20:06.805 --> 20:09.239
I thought that the other
officers I was with

20:09.240 --> 20:12.309
had cleared the room
that I was in, but...

20:13.644 --> 20:16.113
But somebody was hiding,
and they missed him.

20:16.114 --> 20:19.850
I didn't even see the guy's
face until he was choking me.

20:19.851 --> 20:21.518
I couldn't--

20:21.519 --> 20:24.655
I couldn't get his hands
from around my neck.

20:25.757 --> 20:27.224
What happened?

20:27.225 --> 20:29.826
I honestly thought that
I was leaving my baby boy

20:29.827 --> 20:31.895
without his mother.

20:31.896 --> 20:34.965
<i>And I've never been so scared.</i>
<i>And at the same time,</i>

20:34.966 --> 20:36.267
I've never been so mad.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.135
And I wanted to kill him.

20:38.969 --> 20:41.105
I still do.

20:49.814 --> 20:52.282
They raped me.

21:01.259 --> 21:02.959
Any special instructions?

21:02.960 --> 21:04.828
Yeah, cop said to stay out.

21:04.829 --> 21:07.731
They're waiting for a tech
on this one.

21:07.732 --> 21:09.299
Anything else coming in?

21:09.300 --> 21:11.535
Nope, that's the last one.

21:11.536 --> 21:14.237
Okay, gonna lock up.

21:45.336 --> 21:48.072
Yeah?
<i>Hey, Vic, it's Ray Carlson.</i>

21:48.073 --> 21:50.340
Is Matthew supposed
to be outside?

21:50.341 --> 21:52.142
No, why?
- <i>He just walked out of the house.</i>

21:52.143 --> 21:53.944
Took off down the street.

21:53.945 --> 21:55.312
Matthew.
<i>Where's Corrine?</i>

21:55.313 --> 21:56.980
She left about an hour ago.

21:56.981 --> 21:58.649
Where's Cassidy?
<i>Inside the house</i>

21:58.650 --> 22:00.016
with a friend.
Matthew.

22:00.017 --> 22:01.818
<i>Ray, what's going on?</i>

22:01.819 --> 22:03.553
Matthew!

22:04.722 --> 22:06.390
<i>Carlson.</i>
Hey.

22:06.391 --> 22:08.225
I'll take him. I'm a friend
of the Mackeys.

22:08.226 --> 22:10.193
- Let go.
- Wait. Hey.

22:10.194 --> 22:12.029
Hey, I-I don't know
who the Mackeys are.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.229
I don't know who you are.

22:13.230 --> 22:14.965
And you're not leaving
with this kid.

22:14.966 --> 22:16.065
<i>Ray.</i>

22:16.066 --> 22:18.034
We can let the police
figure it out.

22:19.437 --> 22:21.004
Vic, you better
get down here.

22:21.005 --> 22:23.273
Oh, shit.

22:23.274 --> 22:25.075
How's that thing going?

22:25.076 --> 22:27.010
<i>I got sidetracked.</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

22:27.011 --> 22:29.613
<i>Caught a little fish
that's rolling on a bigger one,</i>

22:29.614 --> 22:30.814
<i>Demetrius Harms.</i>

22:30.815 --> 22:32.182
We've been trying
to nail him

22:32.183 --> 22:33.516
<i>since he moved out</i>
<i>from Oakland.</i>

22:33.517 --> 22:35.985
Well, now's our shot.
I can use you.

22:35.986 --> 22:37.354
<i>I'm tied up.</i>

22:37.355 --> 22:38.722
Any way you can
squeeze a couple unis

22:38.723 --> 22:40.623
without alerting
the African queen?

22:40.624 --> 22:43.026
<i>Harms is supposed to be by</i>
<i>himself with one other guy.</i>

22:43.027 --> 22:47.164
I'll make it work.
Sorry to jam you up.

22:47.165 --> 22:48.898
Put him in the van,
we're rolling on Harms.

22:48.899 --> 22:50.701
Aren't we supposed
to process him first?

22:50.702 --> 22:52.368
No time. Harms is
alone or undermanned.

22:52.369 --> 22:55.205
He finds out Larry's been
burned, that'll change fast.

23:00.178 --> 23:02.946
Hey, they're fine,
Vic. Don't worry.

23:05.316 --> 23:06.616
What's going on here?

23:06.617 --> 23:08.185
Are you the father?
Yeah.

23:08.186 --> 23:09.886
Cassidy and Ellen
were drinking beer.

23:09.887 --> 23:11.387
And she had
the door closed.

23:11.388 --> 23:14.224
She wasn't watching Matthew.
Drinking? Where were you?

23:14.225 --> 23:15.959
I had our parent-teacher
conference.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.260
Remember,
I told you?

23:17.261 --> 23:18.995
So you just left
them alone?

23:18.996 --> 23:21.231
Cassidy watches Matthew
all the time.

23:21.232 --> 23:22.699
It was only for an hour.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.202
How do you think I do
everything without you?

23:25.203 --> 23:26.670
I'm a cop.
This is my ex-wife.

23:26.671 --> 23:29.406
The parents of the other
girl are filing a complaint.

23:29.407 --> 23:30.574
Your wife's
gotta be processed.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.809
I'll talk to the parents.
I can smooth this out.

23:32.810 --> 23:34.777
I can release the kids
to your custody,

23:34.778 --> 23:36.713
but that's about the best
you're gonna do.

23:36.714 --> 23:39.315
I gotta take her in.
I'm sorry, man.

23:40.651 --> 23:43.119
I'll be right behind you.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.489
We'll straighten this out
at the sheriff's station.

23:52.630 --> 23:54.832
Don't take your eyes
off them.

23:54.833 --> 23:57.567
Child Services took Wan to
Mission Cross for a rape kit.

23:57.568 --> 23:59.202
Okay. Good work.

23:59.203 --> 24:01.571
Actually,
it's Danny who got her to open up.

24:01.572 --> 24:03.406
The only thing she remembers
about the house

24:03.407 --> 24:05.876
is that it was empty. But she
could hear a freeway nearby,

24:05.877 --> 24:07.777
and she saw part of
a billboard outside.

24:07.778 --> 24:10.681
It was a suntan
lotion ad in Spanish.

24:10.682 --> 24:12.415
I'll check it out.

24:16.321 --> 24:20.190
Um, Wan's been taken
to the hospital.

24:20.191 --> 24:22.559
She was sexually assaulted
by her kidnappers.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.695
The hospital is gonna do
a post-assault examination.

24:25.696 --> 24:26.930
You can't do that.

24:26.931 --> 24:30.200
Ms. Johnson from Child Services
is gonna be with Wan.

24:30.201 --> 24:32.135
Don't worry,
Wan will not be alone.

24:32.136 --> 24:35.639
No. Just bring
my sister back here.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.173
Uh, well,
that's not possible.

24:37.174 --> 24:38.675
This is a criminal
investigation.

24:38.676 --> 24:40.744
Joe.

24:40.745 --> 24:41.912
I'm gonna
get a lawyer.

25:00.264 --> 25:02.666
Yeah?
Is the coast clear?

25:02.667 --> 25:04.034
I got caught up.
I had to cut out.

25:04.035 --> 25:06.035
<i>You're supposed to be outside.</i>

25:06.036 --> 25:07.370
<i>Corrine got arrested.</i>

25:07.371 --> 25:08.972
<i>You gotta be kidding me.</i>

25:08.973 --> 25:10.607
<i>I had to arrange bail.</i>

25:10.608 --> 25:12.809
Did you get it?
<i>Yeah, but now</i>

25:12.810 --> 25:15.012
I gotta get past the guard
blind if I'm gonna get out.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.247
I'm not anywhere near there.
We gotta be there soon.

25:17.248 --> 25:19.683
<i>Fine, I'll handle it.</i>

25:19.684 --> 25:21.851
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

25:28.493 --> 25:31.427
CELL PHONE BEEPING,
LINE RINGING]

25:31.428 --> 25:34.364
This is Vic Mackey.
It's going down.

26:14.404 --> 26:15.872
<i>Try the door.</i>

26:20.778 --> 26:24.080
Yo, Demetrius.

26:24.782 --> 26:27.050
Demetrius. Hey.

26:28.285 --> 26:30.287
Shit. Shit. Argh!

26:30.288 --> 26:32.555
Get it off me. Ungh! Argh!

26:32.556 --> 26:34.391
Get him off. Ow!

26:35.426 --> 26:36.793
Move in. Move in.

26:40.264 --> 26:41.798
Take the back.
I got it.

26:41.799 --> 26:43.566
The place looks empty.
We missed Harms.

26:43.567 --> 26:45.435
I need a paramedic
at 2489 Gorham.

26:45.436 --> 26:47.004
Officer needs assistance.

26:47.005 --> 26:50.073
Shit! Shit!

26:55.679 --> 26:57.814
Over here.

27:03.688 --> 27:05.688
Pull it in. I have
to close the gate.

27:05.689 --> 27:07.657
Don't worry. I don't plan
on being here long.

27:07.658 --> 27:09.158
I don't care.
Just move it.

27:09.159 --> 27:11.327
- Is that everything?
- Most of them.

27:11.328 --> 27:12.896
Had to leave
a few crates behind,

27:12.897 --> 27:16.133
but that should be enough
to wet your whistle.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.201
Hey, is this place secure?

27:18.202 --> 27:20.370
Of course it is.

27:20.371 --> 27:22.572
Something doesn't feel right.

27:22.573 --> 27:26.943
Shane tell you the feds
put you on their hit list?

27:26.944 --> 27:28.745
Get this shit unloaded
and get out of here.

27:28.746 --> 27:30.614
I told you,
this place is safe.

27:30.615 --> 27:32.315
Now get over here
and help your friend.

27:34.252 --> 27:36.019
That's a police radio.

27:36.020 --> 27:38.755
Jesus Christ, you were set up.
Did you hear me?

27:38.756 --> 27:40.723
We gotta go now.
Leave the guns.

27:42.593 --> 27:45.428
Your choice. But don't forget
I tried to pull you out.

27:50.601 --> 27:54.070
Rez. Rez.
Where you going?

27:58.409 --> 28:01.477
This is ridiculous.

28:01.478 --> 28:03.279
Where you going?

28:07.117 --> 28:09.553
What is this?
- Get on the ground.

28:09.554 --> 28:11.454
Get on the ground!

28:11.455 --> 28:13.523
Don't move.
Right there!

28:13.524 --> 28:16.059
Okay, we're clear. Don't move.

28:17.795 --> 28:20.296
You got the results
of the rape kit yet?

28:20.297 --> 28:22.865
Positive.
Um, vaginal tearing.

28:22.866 --> 28:24.467
I been on the phone
with every realtor

28:24.468 --> 28:26.636
who has a house within
earshot of the freeway.

28:26.637 --> 28:29.506
These three have a partial view
of the billboard Wan saw.

28:29.507 --> 28:31.474
Thanks, Steve.
Um, Interrogation Room 2.

28:31.475 --> 28:32.875
Let me get my coat.

28:32.876 --> 28:34.410
Forget your coat,
need you here.

28:34.411 --> 28:36.146
I wanna follow this through.

28:36.147 --> 28:37.647
Her brother's out
looking for a lawyer.

28:37.648 --> 28:39.049
I need you here
to keep them apart

28:39.050 --> 28:40.984
until we figure out
what we've got.

28:40.985 --> 28:43.753
I'll get the rape book,
have her start ID'ing suspects.

28:43.754 --> 28:45.222
Thanks, Steve.

28:45.223 --> 28:48.592
Maybe the Billings minimum
is all we need today.

28:52.897 --> 28:56.099
- It's just like Wan said.
- Yeah.

28:56.100 --> 28:59.469
Hey, um, that story you told her
about the guy choking you?

28:59.470 --> 29:00.737
I made it up.

29:00.738 --> 29:02.939
Did it to draw
her out. Worked.

29:02.940 --> 29:05.342
Um, I'm always here,
you know.

29:05.343 --> 29:08.144
If you ever want to talk
about something.

29:08.145 --> 29:10.179
Guess I'm a better liar
than I thought.

29:21.492 --> 29:25.161
I bet you're glad
you listened to me now.

29:25.162 --> 29:26.763
What happened?

29:26.764 --> 29:28.565
Did they follow you,
or did you bring them?

29:28.566 --> 29:31.200
I'm the guy who just
saved your ass.

29:31.201 --> 29:32.835
Because you heard
the radio?

29:32.836 --> 29:34.704
Consider yourself
lucky.

29:34.705 --> 29:37.941
I got out, but my men didn't.
And I lost the guns.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.710
And you stayed out of jail.
So did we.

29:40.711 --> 29:42.445
Unless your boy
sold us out.

29:42.446 --> 29:45.615
He didn't. And if you did,
you're both dead.

29:45.616 --> 29:48.084
Sending you to jail
would be the worst thing for me.

29:48.085 --> 29:50.353
You'd have nothing to lose
going after my family.

29:50.354 --> 29:51.921
I know that. Think the thing
through!

29:51.922 --> 29:55.024
Vic just risked everything
getting you out of there.

29:55.025 --> 29:56.926
If you're blaming us,
you got a blind spot

29:56.927 --> 29:58.762
to whoever's trying
to burn you.

29:58.763 --> 30:00.063
You got a hole
in your organization

30:00.064 --> 30:01.998
you better plug
before you accuse me again.

30:01.999 --> 30:03.700
What about Khalulian?

30:03.701 --> 30:06.903
He'd never betray me.
We'll see.

30:11.976 --> 30:14.110
Grab anything incriminating
and clear out.

30:14.111 --> 30:15.611
No one knows
about this place.

30:15.612 --> 30:18.615
Like they didn't know about
the trucking company, right?

30:18.616 --> 30:20.049
You sweep in here?

30:20.050 --> 30:22.518
Uh, yeah, today.
Every room?

30:22.519 --> 30:25.355
Just this room, this is
where we were talking.

30:25.356 --> 30:27.224
Khalulian got an office
of his own?

30:27.225 --> 30:29.759
Where he'd have made
the call about tonight?

30:29.760 --> 30:31.627
Over here.

31:10.634 --> 31:12.002
Khalulian might be loyal,

31:12.003 --> 31:13.736
but he's also
stupid and careless.

31:13.737 --> 31:16.238
Better hope he didn't
mention your name or ours.

31:16.239 --> 31:17.673
Let's just
get out of here.

31:17.674 --> 31:20.076
You dodged the feds
tonight with our help.

31:20.077 --> 31:21.878
But that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

31:21.879 --> 31:24.581
You really think the Mexicans
are just gonna go away?

31:24.582 --> 31:26.082
They're gonna keep
coming after you

31:26.083 --> 31:27.384
until they get
what they want.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.752
And we all saw your idea
of taking precautions.

31:29.753 --> 31:32.188
Can you find out what
the Mexicans want from me?

31:32.189 --> 31:36.392
Maybe. But first, I need
to know who's on your crew.

31:36.393 --> 31:39.228
Only the ones that are close,
that you trust.

31:39.229 --> 31:40.530
I'll check them out.

31:40.531 --> 31:43.432
I don't find anything,
that will be the end of it.

31:50.641 --> 31:52.041
Thank you.

31:58.682 --> 32:00.950
You set that whole thing up,
didn't you?

32:00.951 --> 32:04.153
Without telling me.
Something like that, yeah.

32:04.154 --> 32:05.956
And now Rezian is gonna
send me a list

32:05.957 --> 32:07.723
with his most trusted
crew on it.

32:07.724 --> 32:09.692
And everyone who knows
anything about us

32:09.693 --> 32:11.627
and the money train
is gonna be on it.

32:11.628 --> 32:15.698
I'm trying to help you.
Don't you get that?

32:15.699 --> 32:17.366
You think I would
do something

32:17.367 --> 32:19.568
that would let those guns
be in play somewhere else?

32:19.569 --> 32:22.304
That I would let three
random kids in Chicago

32:22.305 --> 32:23.973
get killed
just to save my own?

32:23.974 --> 32:25.708
Okay, so now
Khalulian's busted.

32:25.709 --> 32:27.543
And maybe he doesn't
give up Rezian,

32:27.544 --> 32:30.113
but he's sure as hell gonna
point a finger at you and me.

32:30.114 --> 32:33.450
Let him.
Claudette was in on it.

32:33.451 --> 32:35.885
She knew about the bust?

32:35.886 --> 32:37.820
I told her we were
working with the feds on a tip

32:37.821 --> 32:39.289
you picked up from Rezian.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.657
It was the only way to pull it
off and keep us in the clear.

32:41.658 --> 32:43.493
Khalulian knows
about the money train too.

32:43.494 --> 32:44.861
And if he says anything,

32:44.862 --> 32:47.530
our story is that it was
a lie you fed to Rezian

32:47.531 --> 32:49.865
to keep him close.

32:49.866 --> 32:51.734
So why did you keep me
in the dark?

32:51.735 --> 32:55.805
I don't trust you,
remember?

32:55.806 --> 32:58.040
You know what, that's bullshit.

32:58.041 --> 33:00.676
I've done nothing but look out
for you, Corrine and the kids.

33:00.677 --> 33:03.279
Everything I have told you
has checked out so far.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.748
That hasn't stopped you
from using your secret file

33:05.749 --> 33:08.350
to hang over our heads
listing shit we've ever done.

33:08.351 --> 33:10.153
You know exactly
why I did that.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.589
Look, I'm the one
standing by you, Vic.

33:12.590 --> 33:15.158
You're the one cutting me out.
Punishing me.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.626
And you know what?

33:16.627 --> 33:19.229
It's a stupid, dangerous
game that you're playing.

33:19.230 --> 33:21.097
Because I'm just trying
to help you protect

33:21.098 --> 33:23.466
the only thing
that matters to you.

33:30.106 --> 33:32.308
Interrogation 1, Tony.

33:32.309 --> 33:33.910
That our rapist?

33:33.911 --> 33:35.945
Uh, he's the guy
who's renting the house

33:35.946 --> 33:37.747
looks like
our crime scene.

33:41.218 --> 33:42.652
Hey. Um....

33:43.854 --> 33:45.388
I, uh-- I heard
some of the unis

33:45.389 --> 33:47.857
complaining about the new
administrative duties.

33:47.858 --> 33:50.193
Ever think about bringing
someone on to assist you?

33:50.194 --> 33:52.228
You have someone in mind?
Yeah, Danny.

33:52.229 --> 33:55.297
Danny's a sergeant. I wouldn't
waste her time at a desk.

33:55.298 --> 33:58.100
Think the reason you run
into problems is the person

33:58.101 --> 34:00.336
is underused
or underqualified?

34:00.337 --> 34:01.771
What are you doing, Dutch?

34:01.772 --> 34:03.772
Ever since Lee was born,
she's changed.

34:03.773 --> 34:07.076
Some kind of maternal
survival instinct.

34:07.077 --> 34:09.378
I think what she really wants
is out of the line of fire.

34:09.379 --> 34:11.313
She told you that?
Too much pride.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.715
But if you wanted
to go that way,

34:12.716 --> 34:16.652
I think you'd be
helping her out.

34:16.654 --> 34:18.754
She's already ID'd you
for the kidnapping.

34:18.755 --> 34:21.524
I'm sure the DA can add
conspiracy to commit rape

34:21.525 --> 34:23.159
plus any additional
charges

34:23.159 --> 34:25.995
involving crimes
against a minor.

34:25.996 --> 34:27.831
Any thoughts?

34:30.734 --> 34:33.369
Honestly? I wish
they were all this easy.

34:33.370 --> 34:35.071
I never touched her.

34:35.072 --> 34:38.174
She had sexual contact
with two other minors.

34:38.175 --> 34:39.842
Boys her own age.
It wasn't rape.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.177
It wasn't consensual.

34:41.178 --> 34:44.213
What she experienced was a part
of a therapeutic treatment.

34:44.214 --> 34:46.782
Treatment? For what?

34:46.783 --> 34:48.217
Wan's brother
found out

34:48.219 --> 34:51.353
she was involved
in a homosexual relationship.

34:51.355 --> 34:53.489
Joe had assumed the role
as head of the family

34:53.491 --> 34:54.858
after his father died.

34:54.859 --> 34:57.694
He didn't appreciate his sister
disgracing them.

34:57.695 --> 35:00.897
He wanted to spare his mother
from heartbreak.

35:00.898 --> 35:06.001
So her brother hired you
to rape the lesbian out of her?

35:06.002 --> 35:09.372
To show her
a preferable alternative.

35:09.373 --> 35:11.040
And this was
supposed to get her

35:11.041 --> 35:12.375
to want more sex with men?

35:12.376 --> 35:14.043
I offered positive
encouragement

35:14.044 --> 35:15.311
at a critical moment.

35:15.312 --> 35:17.080
As far as Wan's case
is concerned,

35:17.081 --> 35:19.482
I'm hopeful it was successful.

35:19.483 --> 35:21.918
You have any proof
that Lee hired you

35:21.919 --> 35:22.985
to treat his sister?

35:22.986 --> 35:24.987
I have a signed
legal document

35:24.988 --> 35:27.256
giving me temporary custody
over Wan

35:27.257 --> 35:29.292
while she was in my care.

35:29.293 --> 35:31.427
And a check
for $3000.

35:33.330 --> 35:34.697
How many stitches?

35:34.698 --> 35:36.298
Nineteen.
Anything on Harms?

35:36.299 --> 35:38.300
Yeah, I got a stake
and notify on his car.

35:38.301 --> 35:39.802
And I talked
to a neighbor.

35:39.803 --> 35:42.171
Told me that Harms always
keeps his dog in the back,

35:42.172 --> 35:43.372
not in the house.

35:43.373 --> 35:45.875
Axl gave us up.
He knew we were going there.

35:45.876 --> 35:48.278
That's why I got him
stewing in the clubhouse.

35:51.081 --> 35:54.517
You tipped off Harms, dick wad.
Who's Harms?

35:55.885 --> 35:58.721
He knew we were coming.
Left his pit bull to greet us.

35:58.722 --> 36:00.823
The question is,
what did you get out of it?

36:00.824 --> 36:03.592
You must be more hooked
into Harms than we thought.

36:03.593 --> 36:07.630
You're barking up the
wrong tree, fellas, okay?

36:07.631 --> 36:09.999
That's for the DEA
to decide now.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.036
Those guys like to drag
their feet, it'll be nine, 10 months

36:13.037 --> 36:14.304
before you get
your store back.

36:14.305 --> 36:18.074
Look, I had no problem
giving up Larry.

36:18.075 --> 36:19.609
He's an asshole.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.610
But I didn't wanna burn
a guy like Harms

36:21.611 --> 36:24.280
'cause that's-- That's like
a death sentence, all right?

36:24.281 --> 36:26.716
Where is he at now?

36:28.619 --> 36:30.653
Where is he at now?

36:30.654 --> 36:33.356
We recovered over 900
guns from the trucking factory

36:33.357 --> 36:35.057
thanks to
your cooperation.

36:35.058 --> 36:37.727
Vendrell snuggling up to Rezian
seems to be working.

36:37.728 --> 36:40.163
Southern charm's
good for something.

36:40.164 --> 36:42.265
Thanks for not burning
our Armenian target.

36:42.266 --> 36:43.533
With Rezian
still in play,

36:43.534 --> 36:45.668
we can get deeper
into the organization.

36:45.669 --> 36:47.136
Try to take
the whole thing down.

36:47.137 --> 36:49.005
Well, Khalulian's not talking.

36:49.006 --> 36:50.840
Hasn't mentioned
any cops, either.

36:50.841 --> 36:53.276
So looks like your man's
cover's still solid.

36:53.277 --> 36:55.811
Guess he's as loyal
as Rezian says he is.

37:10.561 --> 37:13.262
Where is she?
In her room.

37:14.097 --> 37:16.632
Cassidy, come out here.

37:20.703 --> 37:23.339
Cassidy, get out here!

37:25.075 --> 37:27.142
Were you thinking?
Never mind the illegal drinking.

37:27.143 --> 37:29.545
You were supposed to be
watching your brother Matthew.

37:29.546 --> 37:31.881
He could've gotten hurt,
or worse.

37:31.882 --> 37:33.716
He's 10 years old.
He's autistic!

37:33.717 --> 37:35.184
Well, nothing happened,
did it?

37:35.185 --> 37:37.420
Your brother was walking
around loose in the street.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.154
He's your responsibility,
not mine.

37:39.155 --> 37:41.457
Hey! Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?!

37:41.458 --> 37:43.659
The only parent that's
ever around to listen to me.

37:43.660 --> 37:45.160
Cassidy!

37:48.464 --> 37:49.799
Ow! You're hurting me!

37:49.800 --> 37:52.135
Don't you ever push
your mother like that!

37:52.136 --> 37:53.535
Do you understand?!

37:53.536 --> 37:55.304
It was an accident.
Vic, let her go.

37:55.305 --> 37:58.073
Do you understand me?!
- Let her go.

38:03.079 --> 38:05.314
We didn't raise her
to be like that.

38:05.315 --> 38:06.615
You should go.

38:06.616 --> 38:09.051
Look, I-I didn't mean
to grab her that hard.

38:09.052 --> 38:11.053
You know what, let me deal
with her, okay?

38:11.054 --> 38:15.091
No, I should apologize.
Go. Now!

38:15.092 --> 38:16.592
Now.

38:29.539 --> 38:31.207
You said me
we had to move,

38:31.208 --> 38:33.542
and you made me
do it all by myself.

38:33.543 --> 38:36.379
Where were you?
I was out.

38:36.380 --> 38:38.114
Oh, yeah, you were out.
Stupid me.

38:38.115 --> 38:40.483
No, you talking to Corrine--
Sh.

38:40.484 --> 38:43.719
You talking to Corrine,
that was stupid you.

38:43.720 --> 38:46.054
Somebody had to do something
for Jackson and me

38:46.055 --> 38:49.124
because when it comes to Vic,
you don't do shit.

38:50.928 --> 38:52.862
Where's the file?

38:52.863 --> 38:54.463
The list of shit
that Vic and I did, Mara.

38:54.464 --> 38:56.064
What did you do with it?

39:05.242 --> 39:07.543
Here.

39:07.544 --> 39:09.712
What did you do?

39:11.147 --> 39:13.015
Goddamn it, Mara.

39:13.016 --> 39:15.485
Shane. Shane.

39:15.486 --> 39:17.220
Where are you
going with that?

39:17.221 --> 39:18.720
I'm gonna give it to Vic.

39:18.721 --> 39:21.323
You can't.
I've already made another copy.

39:21.324 --> 39:23.859
I'm sorry.
I should've told you.

39:23.860 --> 39:26.729
You're always chasing Vic's tail
as if he's the important thing.

39:26.730 --> 39:28.063
I don't know what to think.

39:28.064 --> 39:30.266
I have to get
Vic's family in the clear.

39:30.267 --> 39:33.269
Once this threat is gone,
we are out of his life.

39:33.270 --> 39:35.537
What about
our family?

39:35.538 --> 39:37.206
What about me?
Mara.

39:37.207 --> 39:39.408
You and Jackson and the baby,
you always come first,

39:39.409 --> 39:41.143
you know that.

39:41.144 --> 39:43.546
You have to be patient
a little while longer.

39:43.547 --> 39:46.214
I owe him
this one last thing.

39:48.418 --> 39:50.853
Used to be worried
about Lee not having a sibling.

39:50.854 --> 39:53.956
I'm not so worried anymore.
Yeah, um, hey.

39:53.957 --> 39:57.760
Would you ever consider taking
Claudette's desk full-time?

39:57.761 --> 39:59.328
Help her run this place?

39:59.329 --> 40:02.864
Why?
She's been a little erratic.

40:02.865 --> 40:05.001
You've noticed.
Is she all right?

40:05.002 --> 40:07.536
I can't get specific,

40:07.537 --> 40:09.872
but she can later if she wants.
No, she's not all right.

40:09.873 --> 40:12.275
If she doesn't get her somebody
good backstopping her,

40:12.276 --> 40:14.443
this place could really suffer.

40:15.278 --> 40:17.946
Just think about it,
okay?

40:21.718 --> 40:24.387
Mr. Lee's lawyer got a court
order for Wan's release.

40:24.388 --> 40:28.457
He's got good timing.
Mr. Lee. You're under arrest.

40:28.458 --> 40:30.025
What's the charge?

40:30.026 --> 40:32.895
Kidnapping and conspiracy
to commit rape.

40:32.896 --> 40:34.530
Come on. We're go--
We're going.

40:34.531 --> 40:37.166
Peter Meyers is under
arrest too. He's upstairs.

40:37.167 --> 40:39.201
He's got some, uh,
interesting theories

40:39.202 --> 40:41.571
on treating aberrant
sexual behavior.

40:41.572 --> 40:43.606
Stick around,
we'll talk about them.

40:43.607 --> 40:46.542
I'll get him printed.
Let's go.

40:46.543 --> 40:47.710
Joe?

40:52.182 --> 40:53.416
Wan?

40:53.417 --> 40:55.251
What are you doing here?

40:55.252 --> 40:57.086
Go away.

40:57.087 --> 40:58.688
But I'm the one
that told the police--

40:58.689 --> 41:00.823
Get away from me!
Stay away from me!

41:14.137 --> 41:15.638
Bite looks bad.

41:15.639 --> 41:16.873
How's the bark?

41:16.874 --> 41:18.674
Almost got
my balls chewed off

41:18.675 --> 41:21.510
because we went in there
too quick and undermanned.

41:21.511 --> 41:23.678
Look, man, I'm sorry.
I had no choice.

41:23.679 --> 41:25.981
We all had choices once.
And we made them,

41:25.982 --> 41:27.349
and now we gotta
live with them.

41:27.350 --> 41:30.552
Ronnie, we're gonna
get out of this quicksand.

41:31.788 --> 41:33.889
No, we're not.

41:33.890 --> 41:36.191
Jesus, Vic, everything we do
to get out of this shit

41:36.192 --> 41:37.994
just drags us down deeper.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.562
And hanging with Shane
is gonna push our heads under.

41:40.563 --> 41:41.898
We need Shane right now.

41:41.899 --> 41:43.732
I'm sick
of walking around

41:43.733 --> 41:46.568
smiling at a guy who put
a grenade in Lem's lap.

41:46.569 --> 41:49.372
Hey, you know what's
at stake here for me.

41:49.373 --> 41:51.240
I do, yeah.

41:51.241 --> 41:53.942
But I'm not gonna
drown for Shane.

41:53.943 --> 41:55.677
Or you.

41:58.048 --> 42:01.784
Hey, Rezian just gave me
his list of names.

42:01.785 --> 42:04.386
Aside from Khalulian,
who got swept up tonight,

42:04.387 --> 42:06.822
there's only
five guys.

42:06.823 --> 42:09.291
You think that's
everyone who knows?

42:09.292 --> 42:11.427
Aside from Diro who's
in the wind or dead? Yeah.

42:11.428 --> 42:12.828
Then what are
we waiting for?

42:12.829 --> 42:16.398
Well, protecting my family
was only one part of this war.

42:16.399 --> 42:19.000
Tearing Pezuela down is the
other, and I'm not there yet.

42:25.441 --> 42:27.442
That's it.

42:27.443 --> 42:30.479
That's everything.
There are no copies.

42:30.480 --> 42:32.014
Take it.

42:34.384 --> 42:36.585
It's all I can do.

42:37.788 --> 42:39.855
Now I got nothing on paper
on you guys.

42:39.856 --> 42:41.324
And I talked
to Mara.

42:41.325 --> 42:43.392
The thing that happened
with Corrine...

42:43.393 --> 42:45.461
it will never
happen again.

42:49.332 --> 42:50.933
You want blood from me?

42:50.934 --> 42:54.103
Just break out the goddamn
needle, man, I will give it.

42:57.774 --> 43:00.643
Well, I gotta get back.
- Wait.

43:02.746 --> 43:06.549
Look, we all heard
the lies about Lem.

43:06.550 --> 43:08.684
Knew he was
under pressure, scared.

43:08.685 --> 43:11.119
Thought he might've turned.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.421
None of us will really know

43:12.422 --> 43:15.057
exactly what
he would have done,

43:15.058 --> 43:18.126
but you were the only
one of us who saw him.

43:19.629 --> 43:22.531
Now, I hate it.

43:22.532 --> 43:25.033
And it-- It hurts me.

43:25.034 --> 43:26.769
But under the circumstances,

43:26.770 --> 43:30.339
you-- You made the only decision
you could at the time.

43:30.340 --> 43:32.341
I know that now.

43:38.181 --> 43:40.448
Thank you.

43:40.449 --> 43:42.818
Yeah, we're gonna
all get through this.

43:42.819 --> 43:45.854
Come through the other side
one day.

43:47.290 --> 43:48.858
Yeah.

43:51.728 --> 43:53.362
Yeah.
