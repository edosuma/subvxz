00:52.634 --> 00:55.470
Oh, what up. Look at you two!

00:56.705 --> 00:58.908
All right! Yeah! Yeah.

01:03.678 --> 01:04.712
Hey!

01:05.013 --> 01:05.982
Drink!

01:06.115 --> 01:07.150
You lost!

01:07.282 --> 01:08.951
Okay, cheers. Chicks.

01:11.187 --> 01:12.121
Kate, it's your turn.

01:12.255 --> 01:14.090
Should I text her?

01:14.223 --> 01:17.492
Liz Murphy needs to stop
posting pics of her food.

01:17.626 --> 01:19.661
We get it, Liz, you're vegan.

01:19.796 --> 01:21.264
I don't know.
I was thinking of trying it.

01:21.396 --> 01:23.732
Not me. I like to eat
what I want when I want.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.467
Isn't that how you get fat?

01:26.068 --> 01:30.239
Too many calories is how you get
fat, and I never go over 1,200. See?

01:30.372 --> 01:32.208
I need that.
What's that called?

01:32.340 --> 01:35.144
"Countdown to Skinny." It's so good.
It totally works.

01:35.278 --> 01:36.979
Are we not playing
the game anymore?

01:37.113 --> 01:38.580
Is it this one?

01:39.381 --> 01:41.050
No. That's weird.
What is that?

01:42.118 --> 01:45.788
"If you could know exactly when you were
going to die, would you want to know?"

01:45.922 --> 01:46.823
That's creepy.

01:47.123 --> 01:48.590
- That's literally all it says.
- Awesome!

01:48.723 --> 01:51.526
Okay, new game.
Let's all download it,

01:51.660 --> 01:54.797
and whoever is gonna die first has to
finish all the drinks on the table.

01:54.931 --> 01:56.833
- I'm in.
- All right. I'm so down.

01:56.966 --> 01:58.567
I'm out.
I'm not messing with that.

01:58.700 --> 02:01.137
Don't be such
a little beyotch.

02:01.270 --> 02:02.604
It's just an app.

02:04.372 --> 02:05.507
Okay.

02:09.544 --> 02:11.513
- It's this app?
- Mm-hmm.

02:11.646 --> 02:13.049
One second.

02:18.553 --> 02:20.056
- Everybody ready?
- Let's do it.

02:20.189 --> 02:22.691
- Mm-hmm.
- I got 63 years.

02:22.825 --> 02:24.160
Oh!

02:24.293 --> 02:26.095
Nice. Mine says 32.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.898
I got 22 years. YOLO!

02:29.031 --> 02:30.365
What's yours say, Court?

02:33.035 --> 02:34.237
Court?

02:35.171 --> 02:39.507
Um, it says I only have
three hours to live.

02:41.409 --> 02:42.778
You're gonna die!

02:42.912 --> 02:43.980
Oh!

02:44.113 --> 02:46.481
You lost! Drink up.

02:46.615 --> 02:49.185
- Oh, my God. Evan, get over here.
- What?

02:49.318 --> 02:51.419
We downloaded an app that
tells us when we're gonna die.

02:51.553 --> 02:53.122
Look at your girlfriend's.

02:53.588 --> 02:56.391
- Why would you download that?
- I don't know. We all were.

02:56.524 --> 02:57.860
You better not kill
my best friend.

02:58.693 --> 02:59.829
You guys are ridiculous.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.297
- Drink up, Court.
- Yeah. Yeah.

03:01.429 --> 03:02.999
- You lost.
- What?

03:03.232 --> 03:05.268
- You did lose a bet, so you gotta drink.
- Chug! Come on, Court.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.969
These are all full.
Are you kidding me?

03:07.103 --> 03:08.070
I got you, babe.

03:08.204 --> 03:09.272
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:09.404 --> 03:11.406
Look at that.
Chivalry is not dead.

03:11.874 --> 03:13.309
- Lighten up.
- Yeah. I'll go.

03:13.441 --> 03:14.744
It was Kate's...

03:25.821 --> 03:27.123
Oh!

03:31.894 --> 03:35.064
Babe, you can't drive.
You're wasted.

03:35.331 --> 03:38.134
You know I
drive way better when I'm drunk.

03:39.001 --> 03:39.936
That's not funny.

03:40.069 --> 03:41.037
I'm kidding.

03:42.338 --> 03:43.438
Let's just walk to my house.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.408
Oh, my God.

03:45.540 --> 03:48.244
Please don't tell me you're still
worried about that stupid app.

03:49.045 --> 03:51.781
Baby, I swear,
I'm not gonna kill you.

03:51.914 --> 03:52.815
I know.

03:54.917 --> 03:57.219
Come on.
Let's leave the car here.

03:58.354 --> 04:00.189
I hate when you do this.

04:02.959 --> 04:05.928
Okay. You know what?
Fine. I'll walk by myself.

04:08.663 --> 04:10.933
Courtney. Courtney, come on.

04:13.601 --> 04:16.939
Courtney, come on! I'm fine!
Get in the car!

04:17.505 --> 04:18.540
Please don't do this.

04:18.673 --> 04:20.142
I told you I'm walking.

04:20.276 --> 04:21.777
Fine. Whatever!

04:35.657 --> 04:36.826
Stupid thing.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.053
Stop!

08:28.224 --> 08:29.225
Thank you.

08:32.895 --> 08:33.929
- Not bad.
- Yeah.

08:36.365 --> 08:38.732
Quinn,
can you take over this IV?

08:38.866 --> 08:40.202
Oh, sure.

08:40.970 --> 08:42.938
Don't worry.
She's one of our best interns.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.035
Hey. I told you
you can't keep coming in here.

09:13.168 --> 09:15.738
There's asbestos and lead,
and God knows what.

09:15.871 --> 09:17.706
Just one more minute, please?

09:18.240 --> 09:21.210
Okay. Fine. Just one minute.

09:21.343 --> 09:25.881
Just so you know, if something in
here kills me, I am haunting you.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.820
It's normal to be nervous.
Surgery can be scary.

09:32.821 --> 09:34.423
But you're gonna be fine,
I promise.

09:34.556 --> 09:36.058
It's not that.

09:36.191 --> 09:37.993
I mean, it is that, but...

09:40.162 --> 09:41.964
Forget it.
You'll think I'm a psycho.

09:42.097 --> 09:43.966
Ooh. Now you have to tell me.

09:44.099 --> 09:47.303
Can't just dangle the word
"psycho" and not tell me.

09:50.939 --> 09:52.308
I don't get it.

09:52.541 --> 09:54.643
It's an app that tells you
when you're gonna die.

09:54.778 --> 09:56.111
Dude, seriously?

09:56.245 --> 09:58.881
I know. I said the same thing.

10:00.916 --> 10:02.518
But it knew
we were gonna crash.

10:02.651 --> 10:04.887
Wait, there was someone else
in the car with you?

10:05.020 --> 10:07.723
No, she didn't get in, um,

10:07.856 --> 10:10.826
because that app said she was
gonna die in nine minutes,

10:10.959 --> 10:14.930
and nine minutes later I crashed my car
and a tree branch went through her seat.

10:17.132 --> 10:20.402
So, you feel
like she would have died.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.639
But she didn't, right?
What does that tell you about your app?

10:23.773 --> 10:24.907
She did die.

10:26.275 --> 10:27.910
She died that same night.

10:29.779 --> 10:32.481
It knew, all right?
It was right about her.

10:32.614 --> 10:36.085
And now it's saying that I'm gonna
die during that surgery, so...

10:36.218 --> 10:37.821
Listen to me.
You're smart enough to know

10:37.953 --> 10:40.856
that this app was made by some
loser in his parents' basement

10:40.989 --> 10:42.157
trying to scare people.

10:45.928 --> 10:47.196
Come on.

10:48.430 --> 10:49.898
Your minute's up.

10:52.067 --> 10:54.937
Evan.
I told you that's off-limits.

10:55.070 --> 10:56.338
You can't keep
going back there.

10:56.472 --> 10:57.706
He knows.

10:57.841 --> 10:59.743
He just needed
a minute to himself.

10:59.875 --> 11:01.710
Mm-hmm.

11:01.845 --> 11:02.911
Follow me.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.881
Shit.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.718
Surprise!

11:09.853 --> 11:11.220
We heard you passed your test.

11:11.353 --> 11:13.555
You're officially one of us.

11:13.689 --> 11:16.058
- One of us. One of us.
- Okay. Okay.

11:16.191 --> 11:17.526
- Freaks.
- You're a freak.

11:17.659 --> 11:18.927
Oh, my God.

11:19.061 --> 11:20.929
- Thank you.
- You earned it.

11:22.364 --> 11:24.166
Is that slice number three?

11:24.299 --> 11:24.967
Yep.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.735
So you want diabetes, then?

11:26.870 --> 11:28.904
My grandfather drank
two cases of Coke a week,

11:29.037 --> 11:30.672
and he lived to 94.
So, I'm good.

11:30.807 --> 11:33.575
You know, there's an app for that,
in case you wanna know for sure.

11:33.709 --> 11:36.512
Did the kid in 237
show you that, too?

11:36.645 --> 11:38.247
Why would anyone wanna know
when they're gonna die?

11:38.380 --> 11:40.215
I wanna know.
What's it called?

11:40.349 --> 11:41.550
Countdown, I think.

11:42.017 --> 11:43.719
I don't think God
intends us to know that.

11:43.853 --> 11:45.220
God has a plan for all of us.

11:45.354 --> 11:47.589
It's not really our place
to question when.

11:47.723 --> 11:49.358
Thank you. It's not natural.

11:49.491 --> 11:53.695
Shit! I'm only gonna make it
to 87. Got robbed, kid.

11:53.830 --> 11:55.030
I'm gonna send it to you guys.

11:55.164 --> 11:56.465
I don't want that on my phone.

11:56.598 --> 12:00.536
Fifty-seven years.
That'll make me... 98.

12:00.669 --> 12:02.137
- That's bullshit!
- Is it?

12:02.271 --> 12:03.740
I ran six miles this morning.
How many did you run?

12:03.873 --> 12:07.109
Zero. But I'm still gonna
make it to 87. So, I win.

12:07.242 --> 12:08.477
Ah.

12:08.610 --> 12:10.446
Help! I need help.

12:10.579 --> 12:11.947
- Hey, easy, easy.
- Back up, back up.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.482
- What did she take?
- I don't know.

12:13.615 --> 12:15.017
- How long has she been like this?
- I don't know.

12:15.150 --> 12:16.685
Let's get
two milligrams of Narcan.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.487
Quinn, grab me the OPRK.

12:18.620 --> 12:21.123
Please. Come on, please.

12:23.091 --> 12:25.594
- What is that?
- It's gonna counteract the drugs.

12:26.428 --> 12:27.864
As long as
she's not too far gone.

12:27.996 --> 12:29.631
- Come on, baby.
- Come on.

12:29.766 --> 12:32.034
Hey, if you're gonna do it,
do it now.

12:32.167 --> 12:33.635
- Okay. Here we go.
- Check. Check.

12:36.438 --> 12:38.707
Come on. Come on.
It's coming. It's coming.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.777
There you go. There she is.

12:40.910 --> 12:44.179
Easy, easy, easy.
There you go.

12:44.313 --> 12:47.115
Easy. Welcome back.
We got cake for you.

12:47.249 --> 12:49.618
Easy. You're gonna be okay.

12:49.752 --> 12:51.987
There you go. Easy, easy.

13:45.707 --> 13:49.511
You won't be needing this student
badge anymore, Nurse Harris.

13:49.645 --> 13:50.847
Thanks.

13:51.547 --> 13:53.983
So, where do you wanna continue
the celebration tonight?

13:54.116 --> 13:56.753
Oh. I can't.

13:57.386 --> 13:59.521
I just really wanna finish
my paperwork.

13:59.655 --> 14:01.423
But rain check.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.258
I'm proud of you.

14:07.830 --> 14:10.098
Gonna hold you
to that rain check.

14:22.210 --> 14:23.545
<i>Hey, Scott.</i>

14:23.846 --> 14:26.114
Quick question. I'm just
trying to fill out my I-9.

14:26.248 --> 14:28.650
What do I do
if I don't have a passport?

14:28.785 --> 14:31.821
<i>Just use your birth certificate.
You have that, right?</i>

14:31.955 --> 14:35.892
No. But I think I know where it is.
Hey, Can I call you back?

14:36.025 --> 14:37.459
- <i>Yeah, sure.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

14:43.298 --> 14:44.433
Shit.

16:21.097 --> 16:22.832
Jesus. Jordan!

16:22.965 --> 16:25.902
- You scared the crap out of me!
- Shh. You're gonna wake Dad.

16:26.035 --> 16:27.804
What the hell
are you doing in a closet?

16:31.239 --> 16:32.374
This is Joe.

16:32.507 --> 16:34.476
You wanna put a shirt on, Joe?

16:36.211 --> 16:37.345
Very much so.

16:42.250 --> 16:45.620
Hmm. I think I should go.

16:45.755 --> 16:46.989
I think that's a good idea.

16:47.123 --> 16:48.290
It was really nice meeting...

16:51.727 --> 16:53.462
You shouldn't have boys
coming over.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.397
You can't tell me what to do.

16:55.530 --> 16:57.133
You're not Mom.

16:57.265 --> 17:00.235
Well, if I was, you wouldn't even
think about pulling this shit.

17:00.368 --> 17:01.938
What are you
even doing here, Quinn?

17:02.071 --> 17:03.973
I had to come home
to grab some stuff for work.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.441
And let me guess.
Now that you have it, you're leaving?

17:08.343 --> 17:10.645
See you in another
six months, then. Cool.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.280
Jordan.

17:13.714 --> 17:16.550
- Jordan.
- Go away.

17:18.587 --> 17:19.856
I got some good news today.

17:19.989 --> 17:22.191
I'm officially a nurse.

17:22.324 --> 17:24.425
- Good for you.
- Quinny Bear?

17:25.393 --> 17:27.063
Is everything okay?

17:27.195 --> 17:29.464
It's fine. I'm sorry, Dad.
I didn't mean to wake you.

17:29.598 --> 17:30.767
Hey, come here.

17:33.335 --> 17:35.370
You hungry? You want me
to heat you something up?

17:35.504 --> 17:38.573
I'm okay. I'm actually headed out.
I have a really early morning.

17:38.707 --> 17:41.911
Hey. If you have any time
on Saturday,

17:42.044 --> 17:44.847
we're gonna go lay some fresh
flowers up on your ma's grave.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.348
Um...

17:46.481 --> 17:49.718
Okay. Sure. Sounds nice.

17:49.852 --> 17:52.054
Great. All right.
We'll pick you up Saturday.

17:52.188 --> 17:53.421
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:55.258 --> 17:56.525
- All right.
- Bye, Dad.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.194
- See you. I love you, sweetie.
- Love you.

18:02.031 --> 18:02.965
Hello?

18:04.466 --> 18:06.601
Okay. Two-minute warning.

18:06.735 --> 18:09.738
So, if you need to
use the bathroom, use it now.

18:09.872 --> 18:12.809
You'd be surprised how many people
say, "I'm good,"

18:12.942 --> 18:15.144
and then it's cleanup
on aisle five.

18:19.481 --> 18:20.582
You need any help?

18:21.349 --> 18:22.484
No, I got it.

18:23.318 --> 18:25.420
All right. I'll be right back.

18:28.090 --> 18:29.558
No freaking way.

18:32.594 --> 18:34.230
Hey. I'm at work.
Can I call you back?

18:34.362 --> 18:35.664
Okay. Bye.

19:36.292 --> 19:37.425
What the hell?

20:10.259 --> 20:11.160
Courtney?

20:13.495 --> 20:14.696
Court?

20:43.926 --> 20:45.493
Hey. What's going on?

20:45.627 --> 20:47.430
There was an accident.

20:47.562 --> 20:50.066
The patient died in a stairwell.
They think he might have jumped.

20:50.199 --> 20:51.200
Who was it?

20:51.334 --> 20:52.868
The kid from 237.

20:53.803 --> 20:55.603
- Evan?
- Yeah.

20:59.607 --> 21:01.043
You okay?

21:01.177 --> 21:02.078
Yeah.

21:02.211 --> 21:03.179
Um...

21:04.780 --> 21:06.916
Have they packed up
his room yet?

21:09.218 --> 21:11.420
- Hey, Rach.
- Nurse Amy needs to see you.

21:11.553 --> 21:13.189
She just told me
to do this room.

21:13.322 --> 21:15.992
It's okay, I'll take care of it.
You should go see what she wants.

21:16.125 --> 21:17.059
All right. Thanks.

23:17.213 --> 23:18.547
Hey, Quinny.

23:18.680 --> 23:22.284
Hey, Dad. So, um, you know,
this thing on Saturday,

23:22.418 --> 23:25.488
I checked with the hospital,
and it turns out I do have to work.

23:25.620 --> 23:27.456
That's okay.
You know, work's important.

23:27.590 --> 23:29.091
We can go
another weekend, right?

23:29.225 --> 23:30.860
Yeah. In fact,
this works out great.

23:30.993 --> 23:32.828
Your uncle, Doug,
he's crewing up for a job upstate.

23:32.962 --> 23:34.629
It's good overtime.

23:34.763 --> 23:36.832
- <i>We'll do it when I come back.</i>
- Okay. Thanks, Dad. Love you.

23:36.966 --> 23:37.967
I love you too, Quinny.

23:38.100 --> 23:39.435
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

23:39.568 --> 23:40.903
No personal calls
when you're on the clock.

23:41.036 --> 23:42.371
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

23:42.505 --> 23:43.638
Better not.

24:12.768 --> 24:14.603
Sorry.

24:14.736 --> 24:16.005
I didn't mean to scare you.

24:16.138 --> 24:18.007
Ms. Thompson's IV drip
stopped.

24:18.140 --> 24:19.707
- Mind taking a look?
- Of course.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.451
This poor lady's
been in a coma for weeks.

24:30.986 --> 24:32.454
I know. It's sad.

24:33.155 --> 24:35.257
I think the IV pump
just needs to be reset.

24:36.759 --> 24:38.060
Shit.

24:38.194 --> 24:39.862
- You all right there, kiddo?
- Yeah.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.402
Actually, no.

24:46.734 --> 24:48.003
Hey, hey, hey.

24:49.505 --> 24:50.906
Hey. It's okay.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.908
- It's okay. Talk to me.
- No.

24:53.042 --> 24:54.176
What's the matter?
What happened?

24:54.310 --> 24:55.611
It's nothing.
I'm just having a bad day.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.112
I'm sorry.

24:57.846 --> 24:59.848
First day as an RN,
and I'm already messing up.

24:59.982 --> 25:01.884
Hey. Look at me.

25:02.451 --> 25:03.986
You are an incredible nurse.

25:04.520 --> 25:05.621
Okay?

25:06.055 --> 25:07.823
You're smart. You're driven.

25:07.957 --> 25:10.659
Every time you walk into a patient's
room, you make them smile.

25:10.826 --> 25:13.429
That's a gift, okay?

25:13.562 --> 25:14.496
Come here.

25:17.866 --> 25:18.968
First days are hard.

25:20.803 --> 25:22.104
I should get back to work.

25:23.172 --> 25:25.140
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Sorry.

25:28.877 --> 25:32.548
- Quinn? Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

25:32.681 --> 25:35.918
Remember the recommendation letter you
asked me to write for your license?

25:36.051 --> 25:38.187
- Yeah.
- I gushed about you.

25:41.724 --> 25:43.225
I really wanna kiss you
right now.

25:43.359 --> 25:45.494
Oh, I don't think
that's appropriate.

25:45.628 --> 25:47.663
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

25:48.163 --> 25:51.000
Look. Nobody has to know,
okay? It could be our secret.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.702
Quinn, you like
to help people, right?

25:53.836 --> 25:55.070
Maybe we could help
each other.

25:55.204 --> 25:57.339
- I'm really not comfortable.
- Look. Let's...

25:57.473 --> 25:58.874
No! I said no!

25:59.008 --> 25:59.775
Get off of me!

25:59.908 --> 26:01.510
Stop it!

26:01.644 --> 26:04.313
Jesus Christ, Quinn.
What the hell is wrong with you?

26:04.446 --> 26:06.315
I mean, come on.
I see the way you look at me.

26:06.448 --> 26:08.050
What are you,
some kind of tease?

26:10.586 --> 26:11.553
Look...

26:12.421 --> 26:13.822
I'm sorry.

26:16.058 --> 26:17.192
I thought...

26:18.427 --> 26:20.796
That was really
unprofessional. I apologize.

26:20.929 --> 26:22.331
Okay?

26:23.132 --> 26:25.301
Let's just get back
to work, okay?

26:28.570 --> 26:29.505
Sure.

26:34.710 --> 26:35.911
Hey, Nurse Amy?

26:36.045 --> 26:37.579
Yes, Quinn.

26:37.713 --> 26:39.615
Can I talk to you for a sec?

26:40.416 --> 26:43.152
Amy, I need an updated
vitals check on Mrs. Klein.

26:43.285 --> 26:45.354
- I'll be right there in a second.
- This is important.

26:45.487 --> 26:47.523
Nurse Amy. Now, please.

26:47.656 --> 26:49.291
Quinn, can we talk
about this some other time?

27:56.760 --> 28:00.162
<i>Okay, you guys,
this Countdown app thing,</i>

28:00.295 --> 28:02.531
<i>I'm starting to hear things
and see things.</i>

28:02.664 --> 28:05.367
<i>Like, last night,
I saw my cousin</i>

28:06.168 --> 28:07.569
<i>who died in April.</i>

28:07.703 --> 28:09.839
<i>I saw him,
and he started talking to me.</i>

28:09.972 --> 28:11.540
<i>I know it's real,</i>

28:11.673 --> 28:13.942
<i>and it's toying with me
and it's playing with me.</i>

28:14.076 --> 28:17.079
<i>And it's playing this game of
cat and mouse, and I can feel it.</i>

28:17.212 --> 28:19.615
<i>And it's like it's
feeding off of my fears.</i>

28:19.749 --> 28:21.483
<i>My time is up.</i>

28:22.184 --> 28:23.986
<i>And it feels...</i>

28:26.388 --> 28:28.792
<i>Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.</i>

28:28.924 --> 28:30.058
<i>It's here! It's here!</i>

28:30.192 --> 28:31.293
<i>Help! Help!</i>

30:04.888 --> 30:07.790
Quinn! What are you doing?

30:08.390 --> 30:09.792
Did you get evicted
or something?

30:16.933 --> 30:18.400
Jordan, hang on.
Wait a second.

30:18.534 --> 30:21.069
I can't believe you got that
freaked out by a cockroach.

30:21.203 --> 30:22.704
Where is it? In the kitchen?

30:24.640 --> 30:25.742
Oh, my God.

30:26.308 --> 30:28.443
What the hell did you do
to your phone?

30:29.177 --> 30:30.747
Oh. I, um...

30:31.881 --> 30:32.815
I dropped it.

30:32.949 --> 30:34.616
From where, a plane?

30:35.018 --> 30:38.253
You have a notification from
something called "Countdown."

30:38.755 --> 30:40.790
It says you only have
one day left.

30:41.824 --> 30:42.724
One day until what?

30:42.859 --> 30:44.293
Nothing.

30:44.426 --> 30:46.763
Okay.
Why are you acting so weird?

30:47.830 --> 30:48.865
Why aren't you in school?

30:48.998 --> 30:50.632
Dad went on his work trip.

30:50.767 --> 30:53.735
And since it's your fault I'm
stuck being babysat by Mrs. Talbot,

30:53.870 --> 30:55.737
I thought I could stay here.

30:56.605 --> 30:59.174
Oh, Jordan,
now is not a good time.

30:59.308 --> 31:01.878
"If you could know
exactly when you're gonna die,

31:02.011 --> 31:03.178
would you wanna know?"

31:04.212 --> 31:05.714
Oh, my God.

31:05.848 --> 31:08.350
Is that why you've been acting
like such a freak show?

31:08.483 --> 31:10.820
Because an app told you
you only have one day to live?

31:10.954 --> 31:13.555
No. It's fake, obviously.

31:13.689 --> 31:14.523
Well, I wanna know.

31:15.557 --> 31:16.826
Don't!

31:16.960 --> 31:18.594
What is your problem?

31:18.727 --> 31:21.296
I'm sorry you're stuck with Mrs.
Talbot, but you can't stay here.

31:21.430 --> 31:22.664
Come on.
I never ask for anything.

31:22.799 --> 31:24.867
I told you,
it's just not a good time.

31:25.001 --> 31:26.668
God. Ever since Mom died,

31:26.803 --> 31:29.005
you've really sucked
in the big sister department.

31:29.137 --> 31:32.274
Don't do that. Don't try to make
me feel bad to get what you want.

31:32.407 --> 31:35.711
Just so you know, whatever you thought
Joe and I were doing the other night,

31:35.845 --> 31:37.880
we're definitely
gonna be doing it tonight.

31:45.721 --> 31:46.823
Ah!

31:48.091 --> 31:49.291
Next.

31:50.525 --> 31:52.260
My phone just quit working.

31:52.394 --> 31:55.197
I can't imagine why.
You always put it down with such grace?

31:55.330 --> 31:56.498
What do we use it for,
primarily?

31:56.632 --> 31:58.400
Mostly just texting
and Facebook.

31:58.533 --> 32:00.435
You have more computing power
in your pocket

32:00.569 --> 32:02.270
than NASA did when they put
a man on the moon,

32:02.404 --> 32:04.172
but you use it for
"mostly texting and Facebook."

32:04.306 --> 32:05.875
This is why humanity's doomed.

32:06.009 --> 32:08.410
You know what? I don't need
your smug "tech guy" attitude.

32:08.543 --> 32:09.879
Where's your manager?

32:10.013 --> 32:12.381
I'm gonna go get him.
Just hang on. Hold on.

32:12.849 --> 32:14.917
Hello. I'm the manager.
Something I can help you with, miss?

32:15.051 --> 32:16.986
You just lost yourself
a customer, smart-ass.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.554
I did? Do you think I'll be
able to find another one, or...

32:19.688 --> 32:20.622
Next!

32:22.357 --> 32:23.558
I need a new phone.

32:23.692 --> 32:24.794
Okay. What kind of specs
are you looking for?

32:24.927 --> 32:25.895
These actually just came in.

32:26.029 --> 32:27.195
Yeah. Sure. That one.

32:27.329 --> 32:28.530
Okay.

32:29.065 --> 32:31.934
If you could just...
wait till I run the card...

32:32.935 --> 32:33.903
All right.

32:34.037 --> 32:35.905
Never mind. I trust you.

32:36.039 --> 32:40.843
Something in your eyes says you're
a normal, completely sane person.

32:40.977 --> 32:42.411
Need me to transfer
a SIM card over?

32:42.544 --> 32:44.312
No! I want all new everything.

32:44.446 --> 32:46.749
- New phone, new number, new service.
- Okay.

32:46.883 --> 32:49.451
Now, off the books, for $100
cash, I could jailbreak it.

32:49.584 --> 32:50.753
You can have every app
you'll ever need.

32:50.887 --> 32:52.955
No, I just want it
however it comes.

32:53.089 --> 32:54.389
Okay.

32:57.794 --> 32:58.694
Here you go.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.139
That's good?

33:10.272 --> 33:11.874
Anything else
I can help you with?

33:12.008 --> 33:12.942
No.

33:14.077 --> 33:15.544
Okay.

33:15.677 --> 33:17.880
Next.

33:21.383 --> 33:23.618
- What the hell is this?
- What?

33:23.753 --> 33:24.887
This app!

33:25.021 --> 33:26.421
Why is it on there?

33:28.256 --> 33:29.792
That's weird. Did you buy it?

33:30.193 --> 33:32.829
When could I have done that?
You literally just turned it on.

33:32.962 --> 33:34.097
Okay. Deep breath.

33:34.596 --> 33:37.432
Um...
We'll just delete it. Here.

33:37.566 --> 33:39.568
It won't let you delete it!

33:42.237 --> 33:43.906
Just give it to me.

33:44.539 --> 33:46.209
All right. We're on Yelp.
Doc's Wireless.

33:46.341 --> 33:48.044
Please leave a review.
Appreciate it.

33:48.177 --> 33:50.479
Hey. What app
was she talking about?

34:03.725 --> 34:06.294
Hey! Watch where you're going!

34:06.661 --> 34:08.396
- Sorry.
- Stupid bitch.

34:08.530 --> 34:09.630
I'm sorry.

34:52.275 --> 34:54.609
You again? Are you an idiot?

34:54.744 --> 34:56.511
Look what you did to my Lexus!

34:57.345 --> 34:58.547
Hey! I'm talking to you!

34:58.680 --> 35:01.416
Hey! Hey!

35:01.550 --> 35:02.985
Let her go.

35:03.286 --> 35:05.955
- What are you gonna do about it?
- What am I gonna do about it?

35:06.088 --> 35:08.191
You can leave
and nobody gets hurt.

35:08.323 --> 35:11.928
Or you can stick around and find
out that I'm all sorts of crazy.

35:12.061 --> 35:14.729
And I mean the type of crazy where
I just found out I'm gonna die,

35:14.864 --> 35:16.731
and maybe I feel like
taking a white man with me.

35:16.866 --> 35:19.334
So, the choice is yours.
I really don't give a damn.

35:19.668 --> 35:22.671
Relax, man. It was just
a fender bender. Jesus.

35:25.775 --> 35:28.044
You okay?

35:29.278 --> 35:30.780
You're seeing stuff too,
aren't you?

35:32.480 --> 35:33.749
So am I.

35:39.222 --> 35:41.590
What I wanna know is, why us?

35:42.158 --> 35:43.092
Because we downloaded it.

35:43.226 --> 35:44.861
No, that's not it.

35:44.994 --> 35:47.797
Other people download it,
and they find they're living to be 100.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.933
It told me
I violated the user agreement.

35:51.067 --> 35:53.870
Right. You know,
it said the same thing to me.

35:54.937 --> 35:55.972
Did you read it?

35:56.105 --> 35:58.975
The terms and conditions?
Every word.

35:59.108 --> 36:00.076
Really?

36:00.209 --> 36:01.376
No.

36:01.509 --> 36:04.213
You wanna buy a ticket
to Antarctica? Hmm?

36:04.347 --> 36:06.215
Well, you can't.

36:06.349 --> 36:10.552
Because only the government and the
Illuminati have access to Antarctica.

36:10.685 --> 36:12.520
See? The sons of bitches!

36:12.654 --> 36:14.257
Okay.
What if we go somewhere else?

36:14.389 --> 36:16.959
No, it's okay. There's nowhere
to go back and read it.

36:17.093 --> 36:20.662
I think that there's gotta be
something there that could tell us.

36:20.796 --> 36:22.697
You people need to wake up.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.466
Because if we go there,

36:24.599 --> 36:27.569
we'll be able to see that Antarctica
is the edge of the flat earth.

36:27.702 --> 36:29.537
I guess
anything's possible, Ger.

36:29.671 --> 36:32.574
What if there's a way for us to
look at that user agreement again?

36:32.707 --> 36:33.910
Hey, track with me.

36:34.043 --> 36:36.112
What if we got someone
to download it

36:36.245 --> 36:38.915
just so we could see the
terms, and we don't accept it?

36:39.048 --> 36:40.349
No! That is wrong.

36:40.482 --> 36:41.751
Trust me.

36:42.417 --> 36:44.452
Hey, question for you guys.

36:44.586 --> 36:48.057
Have any of you heard about this new app
that tells you when you're gonna die?

36:48.190 --> 36:49.759
Sounds like bullshit.

36:49.892 --> 36:52.527
Or maybe that's just
what they want you to think.

36:52.661 --> 36:53.896
Anyway, it's called Countdown.

36:54.030 --> 36:55.798
I don't feel good about this.

36:55.932 --> 36:58.566
It's fake.
Like the Holocaust, huh?

36:59.467 --> 37:01.170
Never mind. Go ahead.

37:01.304 --> 37:02.171
Thank you.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.843
"Camera. Microphone.
Location."

37:07.977 --> 37:09.678
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.

37:12.714 --> 37:14.649
"User agreement.
Accept terms and conditions?"

37:14.784 --> 37:16.718
Wait, wait, wait!
Are you crazy?

37:16.852 --> 37:20.122
You should never accept the terms and
conditions without reading them first.

37:20.256 --> 37:22.091
Okay. "User shall use
the application."

37:22.224 --> 37:23.793
Yada, yada, yada.

37:23.926 --> 37:26.929
"User shall accept
the terms of his or her fate.

37:27.863 --> 37:31.733
Any attempt to use information derived
from Countdown to alter the user's fate

37:31.867 --> 37:34.270
will result in
a breach of this agreement."

37:34.403 --> 37:37.139
Accept the terms of our fate.

37:38.140 --> 37:39.342
Hang on.

37:40.009 --> 37:42.345
I was supposed to take a train
tomorrow to go see my aunt,

37:42.477 --> 37:45.982
but the app said that's when I
was going to die, so I canceled.

37:47.083 --> 37:49.785
I canceled something, too,
a trip with my sister and my dad.

37:50.419 --> 37:53.789
Maybe this is when I was
supposed to actually die.

37:55.657 --> 37:57.393
Gerry, don't agree to that.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.527
Trust me.
You don't wanna know.

37:59.661 --> 38:02.597
So, no matter what we do,
we're gonna be dead in a couple of hours.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.667
Well, well, well.

38:05.801 --> 38:09.805
Looks like old Ger Bear's
gonna live to be 91.

38:09.939 --> 38:11.073
Figures.

38:11.207 --> 38:12.408
Let's go.

38:12.808 --> 38:14.310
I love this app.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.083
<i>Whatever's happening to us,</i>

38:21.549 --> 38:24.286
we think
it's because of this app.

38:24.754 --> 38:26.889
From what I've read online
about hauntings,

38:27.023 --> 38:29.191
there are spirits
and then there are...

38:29.524 --> 38:31.093
demons.

38:31.227 --> 38:33.561
But I don't know. That's why
I wanted to talk to an expert.

38:33.695 --> 38:36.165
Yeah. I mean, it seems
like demon stuff to me.

38:36.298 --> 38:40.535
Well, when we talk about demons,
we're usually speaking metaphorically.

38:40.668 --> 38:41.771
Wait a minute.

38:41.904 --> 38:43.873
So you don't think demons
are real?

38:44.874 --> 38:46.375
I'm sorry, but no.

38:46.942 --> 38:50.780
Look, this stuff...
It's not really what I do.

38:50.913 --> 38:53.983
But I know someone who
might be a little better...

38:55.384 --> 38:56.684
qualified.

39:04.994 --> 39:07.363
Hey, Quinn. Can I talk to you
for a second?

39:07.496 --> 39:09.631
Right. I wanted to talk to you
about yesterday.

39:09.765 --> 39:11.000
Give me two minutes.

39:11.733 --> 39:13.536
Yeah. Great.

39:13.668 --> 39:16.205
Because I have
all the time in the world.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.576
And now I'm talking to myself.

39:38.094 --> 39:40.196
Uh. Yeah, hey, this one's taken.

39:44.166 --> 39:46.869
Yo, buddy, I said this one's
taken. Use another...

39:50.139 --> 39:51.941
Hey, kid, use another stall.

40:19.368 --> 40:20.269
You okay in there?

40:24.573 --> 40:26.976
Hey, buddy, do you want me
to get you some help?

41:56.699 --> 41:57.933
Matt.

42:00.469 --> 42:03.439
Where is it, Matt? Where is it?

42:08.043 --> 42:11.447
Hey, you all right... Jesus. You're good.

42:12.414 --> 42:13.449
Okay.

42:14.483 --> 42:15.551
Wow.

42:15.684 --> 42:18.220
I haven't worked here that long,

42:18.354 --> 42:20.823
and that Dr. Sullivan
is this integral...

42:20.956 --> 42:22.191
Quinn, have a seat.

42:24.927 --> 42:26.161
Okay.

42:27.096 --> 42:28.998
This is Dave Andrews from HR,

42:29.131 --> 42:31.066
Emily,
our hospital administrator,

42:31.200 --> 42:33.035
and you know Dr. Sullivan.

42:34.703 --> 42:36.205
Dr. Sullivan
told us what happened.

42:36.338 --> 42:37.206
He did?

42:37.339 --> 42:38.707
Yes, Quinn.

42:39.743 --> 42:44.280
I felt obligated to come clean
and tell them the truth.

42:45.848 --> 42:48.350
This doesn't have to destroy
anyone's life, right?

42:48.484 --> 42:50.819
It was a simple
misunderstanding, that's all.

42:50.953 --> 42:52.154
I'm sorry.

42:53.389 --> 42:54.556
Thank you.

42:55.257 --> 42:58.327
But you cornering me
in my office like that,

42:58.460 --> 43:00.529
that wasn't okay.
It needs to be addressed.

43:00.663 --> 43:02.298
I cornered you?

43:02.998 --> 43:04.768
Look, you don't
need to be embarrassed.

43:04.900 --> 43:07.936
I'm just trying to stop something
before it escalates, that's all.

43:08.070 --> 43:10.806
Today's world of "he said,
she said," you can't be too cautious.

43:10.939 --> 43:12.908
I have to protect myself
and my practice.

43:13.042 --> 43:14.677
And the hospital.

43:14.810 --> 43:16.445
Well, based on
Dr. Sullivan's report,

43:16.578 --> 43:18.580
I've recommended
an immediate suspension.

43:18.714 --> 43:20.115
- What?
- Is that necessary?

43:20.249 --> 43:22.284
Can't we just do counseling,
or transfer her...

43:22.418 --> 43:24.920
I don't believe this.
He is the one who cornered me.

43:25.054 --> 43:26.790
What?
I don't get a say in this?

43:26.922 --> 43:29.525
Quinn, if this is true,
why didn't you just come to me right away?

43:29.658 --> 43:32.762
I tried, but that asshole
beat me to it!

43:32.928 --> 43:34.496
We're trying to help you,
Quinn.

43:34.630 --> 43:35.765
Don't make it worse by lying.

43:35.898 --> 43:37.266
Don't touch me!

43:45.341 --> 43:47.343
She seems like
a very unstable young woman.

43:48.944 --> 43:50.045
We're leaving.

43:54.016 --> 43:55.884
Matt, come on.

43:59.588 --> 44:00.923
What's up with you?

44:02.324 --> 44:03.292
Nothing.

44:22.111 --> 44:23.212
Hello?

44:24.480 --> 44:25.815
Hello?

44:25.948 --> 44:27.416
Can we get
some service out here?

44:27.549 --> 44:29.853
Yo, will you show
a little bit of respect?

44:29.985 --> 44:31.788
Jesus. Shit!

44:31.920 --> 44:34.356
Shh! Do you hear that?

44:45.901 --> 44:47.536
Hello. Hi.

44:47.669 --> 44:49.806
Hallelujah! I'm starving.

44:50.172 --> 44:51.373
You guys got my Grubhub?

44:52.508 --> 44:53.509
No.

44:53.642 --> 44:55.177
No. We just have to ask you
a question.

44:55.310 --> 44:57.279
Do you believe in demons?

44:58.947 --> 45:00.282
Big time.

45:00.983 --> 45:03.085
Look, I know
how hard this is to believe.

45:03.218 --> 45:05.187
No, no, no.

45:05.320 --> 45:07.723
I mean, yes.
It's hard to believe,

45:07.857 --> 45:09.658
but I want it to be true.

45:09.793 --> 45:11.761
I mean, I don't want you guys to...
of course.

45:11.895 --> 45:13.562
But demons, whoo!

45:13.695 --> 45:16.498
I mean, that's kind of what got me
into the cloth in the first place.

45:16.632 --> 45:19.635
Do you know, demons are mentioned
in 19 of the 27 books of the Bible?

45:19.769 --> 45:22.738
Yeah. The Gadarene Swine,
the Simon Magus, the apocrypha.

45:22.872 --> 45:25.207
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be
geeking out on you. Just ahh!

45:25.340 --> 45:26.843
I love this stuff.

45:26.975 --> 45:29.879
I mean, the Bible is like
the ultimate graphic novel.

45:30.012 --> 45:33.982
You know, this whole thing reminds
me of this old story from...

45:35.217 --> 45:38.020
<i>♪ Amen ♪</i>

45:38.153 --> 45:42.157
<i>♪ Amen ♪</i>

45:42.291 --> 45:44.426
<i>♪ Ah ♪</i>

45:44.560 --> 45:45.394
Yes!

45:45.527 --> 45:47.663
So, there was
this young prince

45:47.797 --> 45:51.433
whose father, a much-beloved king,
was old, like brink-of-death old.

45:51.567 --> 45:53.135
With the King
in such bad shape,

45:53.268 --> 45:55.839
it was up to the prince
to lead the army into battle.

45:55.971 --> 45:59.575
So he tracks down
this old gypsy woman.

45:59.708 --> 46:03.278
And he asks her if she can tell
him, will he survive the battle?

46:03.412 --> 46:06.281
The gypsy woman hands him a
scroll with a number on it.

46:06.415 --> 46:10.719
And that number is
the exact moment of his death.

46:10.854 --> 46:12.221
But she warns him,

46:12.354 --> 46:15.157
"Don't use this
to save yourself,

46:15.290 --> 46:17.226
to change your fate."

46:17.359 --> 46:19.528
Now, the prince agrees,
opens up the scroll.

46:19.661 --> 46:21.997
News ain't good,
not even a little bit.

46:22.130 --> 46:23.499
So you know what he does?
Come here.

46:25.133 --> 46:27.971
He sends
his little brother instead.

46:28.103 --> 46:29.906
But his brother doesn't die.

46:30.038 --> 46:32.775
In fact, he goes on
to lead the army to victory.

46:32.909 --> 46:35.845
Meanwhile, our coward prince
goes back to the old gypsy woman,

46:35.979 --> 46:39.816
and he swears to her,
"The angel of death is coming for me."

46:39.949 --> 46:43.987
But she assures him
Death is not coming for him.

46:44.119 --> 46:48.123
What's coming for him now,
there's nothing natural about it.

46:48.925 --> 46:51.026
It's the demon, Ozhin.

46:51.159 --> 46:55.230
The moment the prince changed his
fate, Ozhin came for him.

46:55.364 --> 46:57.566
But not to kill him,
to torment him

46:57.699 --> 47:01.771
right up until the exact moment
the gypsy predicted he would die.

47:01.905 --> 47:03.672
Oh. Thanks, Father.

47:03.806 --> 47:05.507
I didn't think
I could feel any worse.

47:05.641 --> 47:07.744
Look, I think...
I mean, I'm not sure,

47:07.877 --> 47:12.147
but this app seems like a modern
version of what the old gypsy lady did.

47:12.281 --> 47:15.717
If I could just see the code,
I think I would know for sure.

47:15.852 --> 47:17.519
You mean like hack the app?

47:17.854 --> 47:20.589
Do you know how to do that,
or do you guys know someone who could?

47:21.290 --> 47:22.424
I think I might.

47:24.359 --> 47:26.261
Where the heck's my Grubhub?

47:35.470 --> 47:37.807
- Hey, wait! Wait!
- We are closed.

47:37.941 --> 47:40.877
We met earlier, and you said that
you could jailbreak my phone.

47:41.276 --> 47:43.679
Does that mean you know
how to hack into an app?

47:44.146 --> 47:45.581
- Yeah.
- Great.

47:45.714 --> 47:47.784
Look, we need your help.
It's kind of an emergency.

47:47.917 --> 47:49.084
Sorry.

47:49.217 --> 47:50.853
I'm already running late
to my Tinder date,

47:50.987 --> 47:54.356
and I haven't matched with
anybody in a while. So, no.

47:54.489 --> 47:58.360
Wait, wait, wait. You really
wanna impress this girl?

47:58.493 --> 48:01.196
This credit card
has a $2,000 limit.

48:01.330 --> 48:04.700
Yeah. And this one
has about 300 left.

48:05.334 --> 48:07.669
If you help us,
these are yours.

48:07.804 --> 48:09.104
Please.

48:10.405 --> 48:11.540
This feels illegal.

48:14.043 --> 48:15.677
I like it.

48:15.812 --> 48:18.815
Sorry. It's just gonna be,
I don't know, 15 minutes, okay?

48:18.948 --> 48:22.284
I love your profile pic and I cannot
wait to see the real thing in person.

48:22.417 --> 48:23.953
Okay. Bye-bye.

48:24.353 --> 48:26.288
All right.
You got 15 minutes. Phone?

48:26.622 --> 48:28.523
It's this app, right here.

48:28.657 --> 48:32.327
Seriously? The Countdown app,
where it tells you when you're gonna die?

48:32.461 --> 48:34.563
- That's so dumb.
- Did you download it?

48:34.696 --> 48:37.399
Of course. Your hysteria
piqued my interest.

48:37.532 --> 48:39.301
It's a great idea.
It's just horrible execution.

48:39.434 --> 48:41.838
I mean, just a random number
with a countdown?

48:41.971 --> 48:43.940
It's not very scary. Though,
it seems like it worked on you two clowns.

48:44.073 --> 48:46.976
Please, please. Just continue.

48:47.110 --> 48:48.945
Okay. Thanks.

48:51.080 --> 48:52.648
That's weird. Sixty gigs?

48:52.782 --> 48:54.650
- What does that mean?
- That means it's big.

48:54.784 --> 48:56.886
Like "a season of <i>Game of
Thrones</i> on your phone" big.

48:57.020 --> 48:59.321
Which doesn't make any sense
because it's just a clock.

48:59.454 --> 49:01.356
- Can you still delete it?
- Of course.

49:01.490 --> 49:03.258
This is Doc's.
I'm the doc of technology.

49:03.392 --> 49:04.726
I can do anything.

49:05.928 --> 49:07.797
Ha! Check it out.

49:07.930 --> 49:09.032
Now we're in.

49:09.832 --> 49:13.235
What is that?
<i>"Hoc maledictum te..."</i>

49:13.368 --> 49:14.904
- That's Latin.
- Are you sure?

49:15.038 --> 49:17.472
I went to Catholic high school
for four years. I'm sure.

49:17.606 --> 49:19.108
- What's it say?
- No idea.

49:19.241 --> 49:20.810
Physically, I was there,
but mentally...

49:28.283 --> 49:30.019
Oh, my God.

49:30.153 --> 49:32.755
Last name, first name.
And look, these are their countdowns.

49:32.889 --> 49:33.956
There are so many.

49:36.324 --> 49:37.359
Hey, that's me.

49:37.492 --> 49:39.796
Thirty-two years, 11 days.

49:39.929 --> 49:42.765
Hold on. How long do you guys think
the Marvel Universe will last?

49:42.899 --> 49:44.366
Forty years, 50?

49:44.499 --> 49:46.401
Let's just say 60, to be sure.

49:50.073 --> 49:51.373
There it is.

49:51.874 --> 49:54.209
Holy shit. It's working.
Look at his phone.

49:54.342 --> 49:55.644
It worked.

49:56.244 --> 49:57.345
Okay.

49:57.479 --> 49:59.247
What's your name, pumpkin?

49:59.982 --> 50:01.650
Quinn Harris.

50:04.419 --> 50:05.253
Stop.

50:05.387 --> 50:06.856
That's my sister.

50:06.989 --> 50:09.025
Shit.
Of course she downloaded it.

50:09.158 --> 50:12.461
- Her clock is the same as mine.
- Actually, no.

50:12.594 --> 50:14.596
Hers is three minutes shorter.
See?

50:14.730 --> 50:17.265
Wait a minute. Was she supposed
to be with you tomorrow?

50:17.399 --> 50:18.868
Yes. Shit!

50:19.001 --> 50:20.002
Change hers first.

50:20.136 --> 50:21.236
Got another credit card?

50:23.405 --> 50:26.708
Okay. No, no, no. I'll do it.
I'm a good guy. I'll do it.

50:42.657 --> 50:45.494
You know the rules.
No phones at the table.

50:45.627 --> 50:48.131
- But I was...
- You can have it back in the morning.

50:48.263 --> 50:49.397
I was just looking.

50:53.035 --> 50:55.004
Thank you.

50:55.138 --> 50:56.404
You're a genius!

50:56.538 --> 50:57.706
Yeah, no shit.

51:01.911 --> 51:02.912
Are you still good?

51:03.980 --> 51:04.947
Yep.

51:05.680 --> 51:07.216
I got 71 years left.

51:07.349 --> 51:09.819
You know, I kind of feel bad
that I'm gonna outlive you.

51:10.318 --> 51:12.021
Don't. 95 is way too old.

51:12.155 --> 51:14.422
I'm happy with my 86.

51:16.424 --> 51:17.592
So, should I...

51:19.061 --> 51:21.563
drop you at your car?

51:21.696 --> 51:23.732
Yeah, yeah, sure.

51:23.866 --> 51:27.302
Except for the fact that
my car is right over there.

51:29.704 --> 51:34.309
I suppose I'll call you.

51:36.444 --> 51:38.781
Nice, real nice.

51:50.525 --> 51:52.527
Do you wanna be alone tonight?

51:53.963 --> 51:54.897
Not at all.

52:05.208 --> 52:07.977
- Do you mind if I keep these lights on?
- Not at all.

52:14.016 --> 52:16.285
I've been thinking a lot
about what Father John said

52:16.418 --> 52:20.122
about what compelled us to
wanna know when we're gonna die.

52:20.990 --> 52:21.991
Me too.

52:22.825 --> 52:23.793
And?

52:31.466 --> 52:33.602
When I was 10,

52:34.871 --> 52:37.639
my little brother,
Jeff, got really sick.

52:37.773 --> 52:40.042
And we practically lived
at the hospital.

52:40.176 --> 52:43.378
My mom and dad could only focus
on Jeff for those two years,

52:43.511 --> 52:45.147
and I get it.

52:45.281 --> 52:47.449
But at the same time,

52:48.217 --> 52:51.419
I was jealous of all the
attention that he was getting.

52:51.553 --> 52:54.790
He had this toy
that I really wanted.

52:57.525 --> 52:59.661
This stupid robot dinosaur.

52:59.795 --> 53:03.465
So when he was asleep,
I took it.

53:03.598 --> 53:06.668
I stole
my dying brother's toy.

53:08.436 --> 53:12.607
Jeff, he looked up to me.

53:14.643 --> 53:17.113
And I'm the one
that gets to live to be 95.

53:18.480 --> 53:21.650
Yeah, but you were just a kid.

53:24.153 --> 53:25.487
What about you?

53:26.856 --> 53:28.124
My mom.

53:31.360 --> 53:33.396
She was the glue in our family.

53:33.528 --> 53:35.031
But she was tough.

53:35.164 --> 53:36.531
And...

53:38.167 --> 53:40.669
on one of the many nights
I was grounded,

53:40.803 --> 53:43.505
my best friend
was having this huge party.

53:43.638 --> 53:46.641
And I was so sick
of my mom's shit,

53:48.543 --> 53:50.112
so I went.

53:53.581 --> 53:54.884
My mom,

53:58.254 --> 54:00.455
she went out looking for me,

54:02.358 --> 54:04.760
and one drunk driver later,

54:06.594 --> 54:08.264
she was dead.

54:08.397 --> 54:10.099
Quinn, that's not your fault.

54:13.235 --> 54:16.105
Yeah. Thanks.

54:18.374 --> 54:22.078
You know, you don't have to
sleep on the floor.

54:22.211 --> 54:23.112
All right.

54:24.679 --> 54:26.082
But just so we're clear,

54:27.917 --> 54:31.619
I don't usually jump into bed with
girls that I just met off of an app.

54:31.754 --> 54:34.890
Well, technically,
we met because of an app.

54:36.225 --> 54:37.226
Good point.

55:11.093 --> 55:12.028
Matt.

55:13.829 --> 55:15.064
Matt, wake up.

55:18.200 --> 55:19.135
Matt!

55:21.470 --> 55:22.737
Yo, are you calling my name?

55:24.974 --> 55:26.275
Oh!

55:28.643 --> 55:30.712
Quinn. Quinn. Quinn. Relax. Relax.

55:30.846 --> 55:32.815
Quinn. Hey. Hey. Hey.

55:32.948 --> 55:34.549
It was just a nightmare.

55:37.953 --> 55:40.990
No, no, no.
It went back to what it was!

55:41.123 --> 55:42.557
Oh, shit.

55:42.690 --> 55:44.093
So did mine.

55:45.995 --> 55:46.929
Oh, no.

55:48.297 --> 55:49.265
Jordan.

57:20.655 --> 57:21.790
Mrs. Talbot?

58:37.166 --> 58:38.400
<i>Jordan.</i>

58:40.169 --> 58:41.203
Mom?

58:41.637 --> 58:42.938
<i>Where is she?</i>

58:46.942 --> 58:48.410
<i>Where's your sister?</i>

59:21.777 --> 59:22.978
Where is she?

59:27.916 --> 59:29.351
It's okay! It's me!

59:29.952 --> 59:30.919
There's something in the house.

59:31.053 --> 59:32.087
I know. Let's get out of here.

59:35.691 --> 59:37.059
Hello?

59:37.426 --> 59:38.394
Open up!

59:38.527 --> 59:39.528
Father John!

59:41.430 --> 59:42.364
You guys okay?

59:43.232 --> 59:44.300
Did you get the code?

59:45.301 --> 59:46.235
New girl.

59:46.969 --> 59:48.170
I'm gonna shirt on.

59:49.605 --> 59:50.539
Come on.

59:57.112 --> 01:00:02.017
"This curse will come upon you,
will pursue you, and overwhelm you

01:00:02.151 --> 01:00:03.986
until you are
utterly destroyed."

01:00:04.119 --> 01:00:06.989
This is good.
This is really good.

01:00:07.122 --> 01:00:08.324
How is that good?

01:00:08.457 --> 01:00:09.692
Because now we know
what we're dealing with.

01:00:09.825 --> 01:00:11.093
This is a curse.

01:00:11.226 --> 01:00:13.729
Curses come from
the devil and his servants.

01:00:13.862 --> 01:00:16.332
Good news: curses can be broken.

01:00:16.465 --> 01:00:18.334
Can I get
a hallelujah high five?

01:00:18.467 --> 01:00:19.535
Fine.

01:00:19.668 --> 01:00:23.405
Look, gang.
Satan is the father of lies.

01:00:23.539 --> 01:00:25.908
If you can prove him a liar,
you can break the curse.

01:00:26.041 --> 01:00:27.609
What does that mean,
"prove him a liar"?

01:00:27.744 --> 01:00:30.679
If you can foil the clock,
prove it wrong,

01:00:30.814 --> 01:00:33.215
it should lift the curse
from anyone suffering from it.

01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:35.918
So someone has to die
before they're supposed to?

01:00:36.051 --> 01:00:38.220
That would get the job done.

01:00:38.354 --> 01:00:40.289
But I don't think anybody here
wants to die, right?

01:00:40.422 --> 01:00:42.458
So, I'm thinking the opposite.

01:00:42.591 --> 01:00:45.661
We need to keep one of you alive
longer than you're supposed to be.

01:00:46.295 --> 01:00:47.629
How are we
supposed to do that?

01:00:47.764 --> 01:00:49.298
This thing shows up

01:00:49.431 --> 01:00:51.133
and we're just supposed to be
like, "Hang on, I need a sec"?

01:00:51.266 --> 01:00:53.168
That's exactly what
we're gonna do.

01:00:53.302 --> 01:00:56.405
See, there's protection rituals,
prayers that should buy you some time.

01:00:56.773 --> 01:01:00.275
All we need to do is beat
the clock by one second.

01:01:00.409 --> 01:01:03.445
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

01:01:04.213 --> 01:01:07.015
No.
But I've read about it, a lot!

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:09.184
Here!

01:01:09.318 --> 01:01:10.719
Got it. Got it. Got it.

01:01:10.854 --> 01:01:12.020
Look.

01:01:12.688 --> 01:01:14.791
We need to make this
out of salt, right?

01:01:14.923 --> 01:01:17.159
Now, once I bless it,
you should be safe inside.

01:01:17.292 --> 01:01:20.095
See, no impure spirits are
allowed to cross this circle.

01:01:20.229 --> 01:01:23.298
It should...
buy you the time you need.

01:01:23.432 --> 01:01:25.835
Great. Well, I just have
one question.

01:01:25.968 --> 01:01:27.903
Where are we gonna get
that much salt?

01:01:28.036 --> 01:01:29.438
I get mine at Costco.

01:01:29.571 --> 01:01:32.040
Follow me! Come on!
Clock's ticking, everybody!

01:01:32.674 --> 01:01:35.077
Right here. Let me
just turn the lights on.

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:36.445
Good. Right. Come on.

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:40.449
Now, this is rock salt.

01:01:40.582 --> 01:01:42.151
I use it to kill weeds.

01:01:42.618 --> 01:01:44.119
Will that work?

01:01:44.253 --> 01:01:46.388
Salt is salt. Once I bless it,
we're good... I think.

01:01:46.522 --> 01:01:48.457
- What?
- No, we're fine. We're gonna be fine.

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:50.392
What if it just blows
the salt away?

01:01:50.526 --> 01:01:52.027
That could absolutely happen.
I didn't think of that.

01:01:52.161 --> 01:01:53.328
Goddammit! Sorry.

01:01:53.462 --> 01:01:55.097
And I will pray it doesn't.

01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:56.165
I have an idea.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.000
Wait. Here.

01:01:58.133 --> 01:02:00.436
- Hold this.
- Little small, don't you think?

01:02:00.569 --> 01:02:02.271
It's not the size of the cross,
it's the power of the Spirit.

01:02:02.404 --> 01:02:04.239
What if we mix it with this?

01:02:04.373 --> 01:02:06.074
That is a genius idea. Yes.

01:02:06.208 --> 01:02:07.443
Let's clear out a space
right here.

01:02:07.576 --> 01:02:09.178
Great. Come on.
Clock's ticking, guys!

01:02:09.311 --> 01:02:11.447
I'm gonna make a big circle.
Ten, 15 feet. Come on.

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.948
You good? Great. Okay.

01:02:13.081 --> 01:02:14.349
All right, gang. Here we go.

01:02:15.717 --> 01:02:16.786
Thicker, thicker.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.822
Lord,

01:02:18.954 --> 01:02:20.622
bless this salt.

01:02:20.989 --> 01:02:25.895
Let Your light hold back the demons
that try to enter our world, Lord.

01:02:26.028 --> 01:02:27.629
That's it.
Make that symbol perfect.

01:02:27.764 --> 01:02:29.998
Make that as thick as you can.
As thick as you can.

01:02:30.132 --> 01:02:31.333
That line right there.

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.938
Pretty great! I mean,
it's more of an oval than a circle,

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:37.072
but we're under
a lot of pressure.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.409
Okay, how much time
till Matt dies?

01:02:42.611 --> 01:02:45.849
Okay, that symbol's good.
That symbol's good. Okay, that's right.

01:02:45.981 --> 01:02:48.852
Correct. I got this.

01:02:52.054 --> 01:02:53.188
Hey.

01:02:55.257 --> 01:02:56.992
- What if this doesn't work?
- It's going to.

01:02:57.125 --> 01:02:58.594
No, but what if it doesn't?

01:02:58.727 --> 01:03:00.028
Listen to me.

01:03:00.162 --> 01:03:02.531
It's just salt and paint...

01:03:07.236 --> 01:03:08.370
That's good.

01:03:13.977 --> 01:03:16.144
- I think we should get in the circle.
- Come on!

01:03:20.382 --> 01:03:22.952
- Quinn, I'm scared.
- Me too.

01:03:23.085 --> 01:03:26.421
Okay. This might actually
be happening right now.

01:03:27.824 --> 01:03:29.759
- I'm gonna go with the bigger cross.
- What?

01:03:32.227 --> 01:03:33.629
- It's in here!
- Stay close to me.

01:03:33.763 --> 01:03:36.799
Strengthen us in
Your power and might, O Lord.

01:03:37.967 --> 01:03:40.003
Dress us in Your armor, Lord,

01:03:40.135 --> 01:03:43.205
so that we may stand firm against
the machinations of the devil.

01:03:45.173 --> 01:03:47.075
Wait, wait.
It's moving above us.

01:03:50.646 --> 01:03:53.016
- Do you see anything?
- No. You?

01:03:53.148 --> 01:03:54.416
No.

01:03:57.185 --> 01:03:58.654
Okay. Shh, shh, shh.

01:04:06.328 --> 01:04:08.163
Wait, wait! Stay behind me!

01:04:10.399 --> 01:04:12.936
It's working! He can't get in!

01:04:21.978 --> 01:04:23.046
Go back to hell.

01:04:23.178 --> 01:04:24.814
- Where did he go?
- Where did he go?

01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:26.114
Where did he go?

01:04:29.018 --> 01:04:31.086
- Turn it off!
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

01:04:31.219 --> 01:04:32.855
- Matt, turn it off!
- I'm trying!

01:04:33.555 --> 01:04:34.489
There!

01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:41.396
Shut it off!

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.674
Shut it off!

01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:55.243
Where is it, Matt?

01:05:05.955 --> 01:05:07.056
Jeffy?

01:05:07.556 --> 01:05:09.124
Why'd you take my dinosaur?

01:05:09.424 --> 01:05:11.326
Jeffy, I was gonna
give it back. I swear.

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.595
No, you weren't.

01:05:18.266 --> 01:05:19.468
You're right.

01:05:19.969 --> 01:05:20.870
Jeffy, I'm sorry.

01:05:24.439 --> 01:05:25.875
Matt! What do you see?

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:27.209
Jeffy, don't go.

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:31.914
Huh?

01:05:35.717 --> 01:05:36.618
Matt!

01:05:38.855 --> 01:05:39.822
Quinn!

01:05:41.958 --> 01:05:43.725
No, Jordan,
don't break the circle!

01:05:53.368 --> 01:05:54.503
Matt!

01:05:55.071 --> 01:05:56.271
We did it.

01:05:56.405 --> 01:05:57.506
He let me go...

01:06:00.743 --> 01:06:02.779
Help! Help!

01:06:24.466 --> 01:06:26.368
I'll see you soon.

01:06:31.741 --> 01:06:32.708
Quinn?

01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:35.978
He's gone.

01:06:37.947 --> 01:06:39.247
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

01:06:41.683 --> 01:06:43.485
No, it makes sense.
It was his time.

01:06:44.821 --> 01:06:46.989
Pretty soon
it'll be our time, too.

01:06:47.389 --> 01:06:48.690
Please don't say that.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.463
I don't want to, but you
just saw what happened.

01:06:55.697 --> 01:06:57.332
Oh, my God.

01:06:57.466 --> 01:06:58.366
Are you bleeding?

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.235
You're bleeding!

01:07:00.368 --> 01:07:02.171
We need some help in here!

01:07:02.972 --> 01:07:05.108
- We need a wheelchair!
- Quinn, what happened?

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.509
There was an accident. She has
a puncture to the abdomen.

01:07:07.642 --> 01:07:09.311
We got her. We'll get her right in.
Go check in with Rosie.

01:07:09.444 --> 01:07:10.479
Okay.

01:07:10.612 --> 01:07:12.414
No. Please, Quinn,
don't leave me.

01:07:12.547 --> 01:07:15.017
I'm not going anywhere.
I will be right there.

01:07:15.151 --> 01:07:18.253
- Please don't leave me. Please.
- I'll be right there.

01:07:24.559 --> 01:07:25.762
Sorry, honey, are you okay?

01:07:30.166 --> 01:07:31.700
Matt's train.

01:07:31.834 --> 01:07:34.703
That's not too bad. You're
pretty tough though, right?

01:07:36.571 --> 01:07:38.174
Quinn. Hey.

01:07:38.306 --> 01:07:39.809
Can I talk to you?

01:07:39.942 --> 01:07:42.912
- I really...
- I heard what happened with Dr. Sullivan.

01:07:43.045 --> 01:07:44.013
I know what happened.

01:07:45.047 --> 01:07:46.082
I mean...

01:07:46.414 --> 01:07:48.617
I personally know...

01:07:49.218 --> 01:07:50.753
I just want you to know

01:07:50.887 --> 01:07:53.588
that if you go after him,
I'm with you.

01:07:57.059 --> 01:07:58.928
I think you're gonna be
A-okay. Look at me.

01:08:04.867 --> 01:08:06.068
Thank you.

01:08:06.601 --> 01:08:08.805
Truly, thank you, Rachel.

01:08:09.906 --> 01:08:10.840
All right.

01:08:11.606 --> 01:08:12.809
Just like your big sister.

01:08:15.178 --> 01:08:16.310
I'll let you two at it.

01:08:17.546 --> 01:08:18.948
You'll be in good hands,
kiddo.

01:08:20.283 --> 01:08:21.383
Thank you.

01:08:22.417 --> 01:08:23.518
Of course.

01:08:33.095 --> 01:08:33.962
Are you okay?

01:08:36.098 --> 01:08:37.200
Does it hurt?

01:08:37.934 --> 01:08:40.335
Quinn, I know you think
it was your fault,

01:08:40.468 --> 01:08:41.603
Mom dying.

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:44.841
It was my fault.

01:08:44.974 --> 01:08:45.975
What?

01:08:46.108 --> 01:08:48.778
Mom asked me where you were,
and I knew.

01:08:49.812 --> 01:08:51.147
And if I had just told her,

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:53.282
she wouldn't have been driving
way over by the mall.

01:08:53.415 --> 01:08:54.951
Jordan,

01:08:55.952 --> 01:08:59.554
it is not your fault some
drunk asshole ran a red light.

01:09:00.555 --> 01:09:02.524
Then it's not your fault,
either.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.970
I think Mom would be happy we're
spending our last few minutes together.

01:09:16.504 --> 01:09:18.406
These are not
our last few minutes.

01:09:19.506 --> 01:09:20.609
Wait, Quinn.

01:09:21.509 --> 01:09:22.611
Trust me.

01:09:23.746 --> 01:09:26.581
Quinn!
What are you gonna do? Quinn!

01:09:29.785 --> 01:09:32.154
No,
I just finished a procedure.

01:09:32.287 --> 01:09:33.856
Saving lives
one day at a time.

01:09:36.859 --> 01:09:38.693
Okay, honey,
I'll let you get back to work.

01:09:39.795 --> 01:09:41.796
I love you, too. Bye.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:45.600
You shouldn't be in here.

01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:48.037
I wanted to thank you
for helping my sister.

01:09:49.138 --> 01:09:50.072
And...

01:09:50.805 --> 01:09:52.375
say that I'm sorry.

01:09:52.506 --> 01:09:53.608
For what?

01:09:55.077 --> 01:09:56.645
For everything.

01:09:56.779 --> 01:10:00.983
I can't stop thinking about how
things could've gone that day.

01:10:01.117 --> 01:10:03.352
I understand
why you did what you did.

01:10:03.485 --> 01:10:05.154
I put you in that position.

01:10:08.357 --> 01:10:12.694
If only I had followed through with
how I really felt in that moment.

01:10:14.629 --> 01:10:16.098
I was just scared.

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:22.504
Bullshit.

01:10:25.174 --> 01:10:27.076
You think I'm stupid? Hmm?

01:10:28.177 --> 01:10:29.111
What do you really want?

01:10:30.346 --> 01:10:31.414
I want my job back.

01:10:32.114 --> 01:10:34.183
You said that
we both like helping people.

01:10:34.582 --> 01:10:37.954
So maybe you can help me

01:10:38.421 --> 01:10:39.789
and I...

01:10:41.556 --> 01:10:42.724
...could help you.

01:10:45.761 --> 01:10:47.129
Okay, what are you doing?

01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:49.231
You recording this?

01:10:52.734 --> 01:10:54.636
Search me if you want.

01:10:55.871 --> 01:10:57.472
I'll be in the closed wing.

01:10:57.605 --> 01:10:59.208
You should come.

01:10:59.742 --> 01:11:01.476
Or don't. It's up to you.

01:11:19.527 --> 01:11:20.595
Quinn?

01:11:23.531 --> 01:11:24.566
Quinn?

01:11:24.699 --> 01:11:25.901
Come find me.

01:11:40.682 --> 01:11:44.120
You know, I'm not gonna lie,

01:11:44.619 --> 01:11:46.856
I didn't see this one coming.

01:11:51.526 --> 01:11:53.229
You dropped something.

01:11:53.863 --> 01:11:57.033
Close your eyes
and say, "Marco."

01:11:58.801 --> 01:12:01.103
I like this.

01:12:02.204 --> 01:12:03.339
Marco.

01:12:03.705 --> 01:12:04.807
Polo.

01:12:06.574 --> 01:12:08.244
Marco.

01:12:08.576 --> 01:12:10.046
Polo.

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:16.052
Marco.

01:12:18.354 --> 01:12:19.288
Polo.

01:12:22.458 --> 01:12:23.893
I can hear you breathing.

01:12:27.329 --> 01:12:29.065
Bitch!

01:12:29.198 --> 01:12:31.167
- What the hell is that?
- Morphine,

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.536
enough to kill you three times,
you piece of shit!

01:12:33.668 --> 01:12:34.904
Quinn, don't!

01:12:36.005 --> 01:12:37.840
It's either him or you.

01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:43.746
Did you see that? It saved him.

01:12:43.879 --> 01:12:45.081
This is gonna work.

01:12:45.214 --> 01:12:46.148
What's gonna work?

01:12:46.849 --> 01:12:48.317
He has the app.

01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:50.486
If he dies before he's supposed
to, it'll break the curse!

01:12:50.618 --> 01:12:51.887
Quinn!

01:13:05.733 --> 01:13:08.571
Quinn, where are you?

01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:04.226
Crazy bitch!
What the hell was that thing?

01:14:10.366 --> 01:14:15.703
Doesn't matter. I'll tell the
cops how you lured me back here.

01:14:16.338 --> 01:14:18.440
How I had to kill you
out of self-defense.

01:14:25.247 --> 01:14:27.349
Your time's up, you rapey fuck!

01:14:40.695 --> 01:14:42.131
Shit.

01:14:50.639 --> 01:14:53.242
Jordan. Jordan!

01:15:00.816 --> 01:15:01.984
Jordan.

01:15:40.889 --> 01:15:44.426
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

01:17:01.837 --> 01:17:03.005
Hey!

01:17:03.138 --> 01:17:04.440
Get away from her.

01:17:06.776 --> 01:17:07.777
What are you doing?

01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:09.545
I love you, Jordan.

01:17:10.579 --> 01:17:11.748
I'll always be with you.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.449
Quinn, don't!

01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:15.918
Quinny Bear.

01:17:20.255 --> 01:17:21.156
Mom?

01:17:22.725 --> 01:17:23.892
Where were you that night?

01:17:29.766 --> 01:17:31.467
I'm so sorry.

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:33.669
I was looking for you.

01:17:33.803 --> 01:17:35.204
I know.

01:17:39.141 --> 01:17:40.209
I miss you.

01:17:41.143 --> 01:17:43.145
I miss you too, baby.

01:17:43.979 --> 01:17:45.247
Come here.

01:18:05.334 --> 01:18:06.135
No.

01:18:06.268 --> 01:18:08.003
You're not in control anymore.

01:18:08.604 --> 01:18:09.738
I am.

01:18:10.105 --> 01:18:11.473
Quinn, no!

01:18:16.011 --> 01:18:17.112
Quinn!

01:18:20.983 --> 01:18:22.518
No!

01:19:14.203 --> 01:19:15.737
Somebody help me!

01:19:17.506 --> 01:19:18.440
Quinn!

01:19:21.443 --> 01:19:22.277
Please.

01:19:22.411 --> 01:19:24.279
Please don't leave me.

01:19:25.247 --> 01:19:26.916
Please.

01:19:27.416 --> 01:19:29.184
Please don't leave me.

01:19:32.387 --> 01:19:33.322
Please.

01:20:10.125 --> 01:20:11.326
Come on, come on, come on.

01:20:11.727 --> 01:20:13.161
Please work.

01:20:13.295 --> 01:20:14.530
Come on, come on, come on.

01:20:15.798 --> 01:20:17.399
Please work, please.

01:20:23.238 --> 01:20:25.107
Quinn, come on.

01:20:36.786 --> 01:20:37.954
See?

01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:40.689
I told you
I'd always be with you.

01:20:40.823 --> 01:20:42.190
I love you.

01:20:58.273 --> 01:20:59.708
Happy birthday, Mom.

01:21:06.849 --> 01:21:07.750
They're beautiful.

01:21:25.233 --> 01:21:26.401
Oh, my gosh.

01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:30.205
Three more women came
forward about Dr. Sullivan.

01:21:30.339 --> 01:21:32.107
Looks like he's going away
for a long time.

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:33.776
Good. Serves him right.

01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:36.111
I'm just glad
no one else is gonna get hurt.

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.348
Coming to the house, Quinny?

01:21:39.481 --> 01:21:41.050
I have to stop
at the hospital first.

01:21:41.183 --> 01:21:42.819
- You wanna come with me?
- Yeah.

01:21:42.952 --> 01:21:45.320
- All right. I'll see you guys at home.
- Cool.

01:21:49.025 --> 01:21:49.892
You coming?

01:21:54.296 --> 01:21:55.330
What's wrong?

01:22:56.425 --> 01:22:58.593
- A little more?
- No, thank you. No.

01:22:59.028 --> 01:23:01.064
Oh. We killed it.

01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:05.300
I gotta tell you something.
Now that we know each other a little bit,

01:23:05.434 --> 01:23:07.636
you are a lot chestier
than your profile pic.

01:23:07.770 --> 01:23:09.705
Oh. Thanks.

01:23:10.238 --> 01:23:12.175
And you don't look
anything like yours.

01:23:12.307 --> 01:23:13.709
- Appreciate that. Thank you.
- At all.

01:23:13.843 --> 01:23:17.379
Okay. I revised your check
for the third time.

01:23:17.512 --> 01:23:19.314
Also, we closed
a half hour ago. So...

01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:26.655
We love it here.

01:23:27.255 --> 01:23:28.423
I'm sure you do.

01:23:28.557 --> 01:23:30.193
- What a catch.
- Yeah.

01:23:30.325 --> 01:23:31.928
I don't know
what your data plan is,

01:23:32.061 --> 01:23:36.833
but I can get you a 15,
maybe 20% discount.

01:23:36.966 --> 01:23:38.134
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.601
I'm gonna
use the ladies' room.

01:23:39.735 --> 01:23:42.537
Okay. I will be here,
my darling.

01:23:42.671 --> 01:23:43.840
Yeah.

01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:54.349
What the hell?

01:23:55.417 --> 01:23:56.919
Hello?

01:23:57.419 --> 01:24:00.022
Dude, we're still here.
Come on, man.

01:24:00.156 --> 01:24:01.858
Dude.

01:24:01.991 --> 01:24:03.126
What the hell?

01:24:06.691 --> 01:24:11.691
