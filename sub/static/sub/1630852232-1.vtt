00:11.411 --> 00:17.251
♪ ♪

00:19.686 --> 00:22.686
JOHNNY: This land
is far removed from the city.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.057
And that’s what I’m after.

00:26.593 --> 00:29.533
I’m not looking to live
surrounded by millions and

00:29.563 --> 00:31.333
millions of people.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.903
So, there’s fresh
wolf tracks here.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.936
Where there’s wolves,
there’s caribou.

00:37.971 --> 00:40.041
And where there’s caribou,
there’s food for me.

00:41.408 --> 00:45.308
The wolves just track the
caribou in their own tracks

00:45.345 --> 00:47.675
because it’s easier to
keep up with them stepping

00:47.714 --> 00:48.954
in their footprints,

00:48.982 --> 00:51.422
rather than breaking a trail
every time they chase them.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.292
It’s a, it’s a smart tactic.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.360
I wish I could fit
in their hoof prints.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.388
This one was moving at
a faster pace and uh,

01:00.427 --> 01:02.397
caribou don’t run for fun.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.163
Seems like there’s a lot of
movement in this direction,

01:04.197 --> 01:06.597
I’m just gonna keep walking.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.069
I’m always in need of meat.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.705
When the caribou come around,

01:13.740 --> 01:15.340
it’s important
that I do capitalize

01:15.375 --> 01:17.405
on that moment, because

01:18.111 --> 01:21.011
I live about 70 miles
north of the Arctic Circle

01:21.048 --> 01:23.618
in the Brooks Range of Alaska.

01:24.151 --> 01:26.421
I’m 200 miles from
the nearest city.

01:26.453 --> 01:27.993
There’s nothing out here.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.621
There’s no roads.
There’s no stores.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.356
There’s no help.

01:31.391 --> 01:33.631
It’s me left to
fend for myself.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.804
These tracks are, they’re
old and they’re covered up,

01:36.830 --> 01:38.600
so it’s hard to tell
exactly what they are.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.632
But, by seeing some of
those grasses nipped off,

01:40.667 --> 01:43.467
I can tell that
those were caribou.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.544
It’s something in my DNA,
something within me that

01:46.573 --> 01:49.683
couldn’t rest until it
got to the wilderness.

01:50.210 --> 01:54.310
I belong in nature; I
don’t belong in the city.

01:57.117 --> 02:01.247
This is where the rib,
looks like the sternum here.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.333
You can see all the fat
was chewed off of it.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.760
You can see the wolves’
jaws just crush right

02:09.796 --> 02:11.426
through these bones here.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.696
Looks like there might be
some more of it right over here.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.442
Oh yeah.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.084
Damn.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.580
That’s the spine.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.189
Wow. I mean,
there’s still red on here.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.392
This is still
pretty fresh looking.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.159
The caribou travel in herds.

02:41.194 --> 02:42.734
They stick with
safety in numbers.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.573
So, if there’s one here,
there’s gonna be more.

02:46.767 --> 02:50.497
Gonna go walk around
some more and scout.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.135
This is life.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.585
JOHNNY: Life in the Arctic.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.619
ALEX: I always get like,
little butterflies before we

03:07.654 --> 03:09.224
go in a bush plane, you know?

03:09.256 --> 03:11.216
I mean I know it’s
perfectly safe,

03:11.258 --> 03:13.988
but same thing
with helicopters.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.397
Just cause they’re
kinda bouncy, you know?

03:17.864 --> 03:20.204
My name is Alex Javor,
and I live in interior Alaska.

03:23.403 --> 03:26.343
My ideal subsistence
lifestyle is to be like any

03:26.373 --> 03:28.043
animal in the woods.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.235
I don’t want to be
a civilized human.

03:32.979 --> 03:35.349
I’m about to take
a bush flight out to a place

03:35.382 --> 03:36.852
called Deadman Lake.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.953
Before I moved to Alaska,
I bought property there,

03:38.985 --> 03:40.485
but I’ve never
even been to it.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.190
PILOT: Okay.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.486
ALEX: Once I got
up here to Alaska,

03:44.524 --> 03:48.264
it seemed too daunting,
such a remote place.

03:50.797 --> 03:53.367
And so, I opted for a
place that was closer to

03:53.400 --> 03:55.600
a road system.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.739
You know, Bear Creek was
off‐grid, remote living.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.872
I gained a lot of confidence.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.777
But, compared to here,
it was kinda like going with

04:02.809 --> 04:04.679
the training wheels on.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.208
And what I wanna learn is,
will this be a better place

04:07.247 --> 04:08.847
for me to live
than Bear Creek?

04:08.882 --> 04:11.652
Because, um...

04:12.385 --> 04:15.085
PILOT: Okay, here we are.
ALEX: Thank you, sir.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.486
ALEX: Once the
pilot leaves, you know.

04:18.525 --> 04:21.265
That’s it.

04:21.461 --> 04:24.201
I have the bare essentials
to survive here.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.475
And there’s one important
thing that’s going to make

04:27.501 --> 04:29.871
life a lot harder out
here that I don’t have.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.074
That’s Sipsey.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.666
I left him with some family.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.008
I know what I’m doing
here is pretty risky.

04:37.577 --> 04:39.347
That’s going to be hard,
not having my best friend,

04:39.379 --> 04:41.249
but, um, I gotta
think about safety,

04:41.281 --> 04:43.151
first and foremost.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.418
ALEX: So yeah, I feel a
little bit small right now.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.124
You know, I don’t have a
warm cabin waiting for me.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.493
I’m just gonna be
living in a tent.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.286
Time is important right now.

04:54.327 --> 04:57.897
I will freeze to death if
I don’t get a camp set up.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.902
So, there’s a little
hill just back here.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.645
My property is kind
of on that hill.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.871
I just gotta cut
through the woods here,

05:06.907 --> 05:10.277
get up on to that hill,
and then I’ve gotta find a

05:10.310 --> 05:12.850
spot to put my tent
down for the night.

05:15.048 --> 05:18.248
If I had gotten dropped
off here in 2013, you know,

05:18.618 --> 05:20.318
when I was just
totally new to this.

05:20.353 --> 05:23.323
I would have betted
on me starving.

05:23.557 --> 05:27.057
But I mean, that’s the
kind of scenario I sought.

05:27.093 --> 05:29.663
So, this is my land here.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.269
I’ve never seen it.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.571
Uh, I mean.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.472
I didn’t really ever
think I would see it.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.115
But I feel ready for it now.

05:41.608 --> 05:44.208
The first thing I need to
do is focus on my big needs.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.014
I don’t want to
freeze to death.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.976
I need to get a
shelter put up.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.884
And then, I need to get
some wood for my stove.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.815
As long as I can make
a fire, melt some snow,

05:54.855 --> 05:58.095
and eat some food,
I can survive.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.926
We’re just getting started.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.104
CHRIS: Everything out
here is dangerous.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.533
But as long as you
understand that.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.198
And you prepare for it.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.897
Life’s pretty good out here.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.468
Just don’t forget,

06:13.506 --> 06:15.836
everything out here
wants to kill you.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.606
My name is Christopher Morse.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.748
My wife and I are
out here in the wild.

06:24.417 --> 06:27.317
There’s not another soul
for miles upon miles out here.

06:28.421 --> 06:29.591
Hey, thanks for that.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.163
JESSI: Yeah.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.831
CHRIS: My dad built this
cabin and left it to me.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.730
We’re doing our best out here,
we’re trying to live off grid.

06:36.763 --> 06:39.033
All right, old girl.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.865
Off civilization.

06:41.434 --> 06:42.474
But you know.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.772
We need supplies
from time to time.

06:44.804 --> 06:46.714
If we can get this
trail opened up,

06:46.740 --> 06:48.640
the amount of possibilities
it’s going to give us is

06:48.675 --> 06:50.415
really awesome.

06:50.877 --> 06:54.147
But the last time I went to
Deep Creek it was steep that

06:54.180 --> 06:55.950
there was no getting
a snow machine across.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.622
And it is like the
main thoroughfare to

06:57.651 --> 06:59.021
get towards town.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.052
We’ll kinda eyeball
it and see if it’s

07:01.087 --> 07:02.587
something we can handle.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.522
JESSI: See how it is.

07:04.557 --> 07:05.987
I’m stoked.

07:11.398 --> 07:14.328
CHRIS: Get comfortable.
We got a long ride.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.499
JESSI: Chris and I would
really like to have a way to

07:18.538 --> 07:21.408
get to town and back.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.411
Be able to go
and get supplies,

07:23.443 --> 07:26.113
have an emergency way out.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.176
And the only way to do
that is to go over Deep Creek.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.054
Holy smokes.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.432
There’s no way
around Deep Creek.

07:42.829 --> 07:47.099
It is vertical banks and it’s
like a 100‐mile‐long river.

07:48.601 --> 07:49.601
This it?

07:49.636 --> 07:50.866
CHRIS: Yeah.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.174
Let’s see what we
got down here, huh?

07:54.841 --> 07:57.741
Well, that does
not look promising.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.379
JESSI: This looks steep.

08:02.415 --> 08:04.645
CHRIS: Man, this is a mess.

08:05.552 --> 08:08.192
Deep Creek’s just a lot
bigger than I remember.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.091
There’s no way to get through
it without building some kind

08:10.123 --> 08:12.593
of ramp or bridge.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.889
We got our work
cut out for us.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.028
That is steep, man.

08:18.898 --> 08:21.598
BRITTANY: When you live so far
away from the grocery store.

08:21.634 --> 08:25.404
You have to know where
to go to hunt in case you

08:25.438 --> 08:26.868
can’t get to town.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.483
So that’s something that
Kaleb and I are going to do.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.951
Uh, I missed that one.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.149
(gunshot)

08:37.183 --> 08:39.053
Hm.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.719
My name is Brittany Rowland.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.394
I live here in
McCarthy, Alaska.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.223
With my husband Kaleb
and my two children,

08:45.258 --> 08:46.958
Gilbert and Elovie.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.027
Oh, man.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.903
I grew up in the city.

08:51.931 --> 08:54.701
I used to joke that
the grocery store
was my happy place.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.796
Hit.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.744
When we first moved out here,

08:59.773 --> 09:02.683
it was because Kaleb
wanted to live out here.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.847
He grew up out here
from about nine on up.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.823
And he’s a mountain man
through and through.

09:10.683 --> 09:12.693
However, as the
years have gone by,

09:12.719 --> 09:14.549
I actually prefer it out here.

09:14.587 --> 09:17.887
Even when I go to visit
the city, I miss home.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.396
Did you see that?

09:23.463 --> 09:25.633
Oh, man, that was awesome!

09:29.035 --> 09:32.435
See what happens when
we do one of the cans

09:33.373 --> 09:35.243
(gunshot and aluminum pop)

09:37.377 --> 09:39.707
Oh man, I love
when things go pop.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.321
In McCarthy,
you’re either hunting or

09:43.349 --> 09:45.479
preparing for the hunt.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.192
That’s a dead
bird right there.

09:51.958 --> 09:55.858
Part of subsistence hunting,
you want to have many places

09:55.895 --> 09:57.795
that you can harvest animals,

09:57.831 --> 10:00.671
that way you don’t
deplete the area.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.898
Right now, here in McCarthy,

10:02.936 --> 10:05.536
our small game
population is really low,

10:05.572 --> 10:07.812
it needs time to recover.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.381
We’re going to fly out to
Donahoe Basin and figure out

10:11.411 --> 10:13.811
if that’s a good place
for us to be able to hunt

10:13.847 --> 10:15.917
in the future.

10:16.182 --> 10:17.522
Hello.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.590
KALEB: How was
target practice?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.449
BRITTANY: Fantastic.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.288
KALEB: Can you hit anything?

10:23.323 --> 10:25.023
BRITTANY: I hit a lot of things.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.028
KALEB: Kids are up at Grandma’s.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.530
They’re pretty happy.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.261
They’re excited to hang out
with Grandma for a couple days,

10:30.296 --> 10:32.896
I’m just getting this
oil change all wrapped up,

10:32.932 --> 10:35.502
so I’m pretty
much ready to go.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.073
BRITTANY: Cool.

10:39.339 --> 10:43.879
KALEB: Oof, I must say I was a
little jealous of you getting

10:43.910 --> 10:47.450
to target practice this
morning when I had to take

10:47.480 --> 10:48.750
care of business.

10:48.781 --> 10:50.751
BRITTANY: I’m sorry honey.

10:50.783 --> 10:53.153
I wish you could’ve
been shooting with me.

10:53.186 --> 10:56.156
You would’ve seen
how amazing I was.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.133
KALEB: Deadeye Brit.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.892
I have not hunted the
Donahoe Valley before.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.132
Okay, Piper load up.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.405
BRITTANY: Good girl.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.432
KALEB: It’s about
ten miles away.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.168
This gets closed.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.573
So, it’s a first
for both of us.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.876
All right, off
to Donahoe we go.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.379
BRITTANY: The more
self‐reliant we are,

11:19.412 --> 11:21.312
the better.

11:22.248 --> 11:25.578
The really cool thing about
having a pilot for a husband

11:25.618 --> 11:29.588

JOHNNY: One of the first things
I do when I see snow coming,

12:16.603 --> 12:19.173
I look at the tracks
that are already on the lake.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.765
And then read the tracks
right after it snows.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.906

12:50.470 --> 12:53.410
That’s a 300‐yard shot.
That’s way too far.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.906
They’ll think we’re
caribou if we just chill out.

13:03.983 --> 13:06.323
At this point, they
know I’m not a threat,

13:06.719 --> 13:08.419

The second caribou,

18:38.417 --> 18:40.747
I’m gonna bury it in snow and
that should help insulate it,

18:40.786 --> 18:42.686
so it doesn’t freeze.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.092
I do have some reservations
about burying it,

18:45.124 --> 18:48.464
because if predators
find that caribou,

18:48.494 --> 18:50.504
they’re gonna eat it up.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.936
I mean it was pretty
cold but, uh, ya know,

19:35.975 --> 19:37.545
inside my tent all
bundled up I was,

19:37.576 --> 19:39.206
I was able to sleep.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.455
However, I’m in the
interior of Alaska.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.550
Just like, one week ago,
it was negative 60.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.423
The most pressing concern
this time of year is

19:47.453 --> 19:50.223
hypothermia, frostbite,
freezing to death.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.660
So, it’s just I
gotta have wood.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.992
I gotta be able to burn wood.

19:55.227 --> 19:56.957
I’m seeing lots of
good stuff here.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.956
There’s quite a few,
um, dead trees,

19:58.998 --> 20:01.328
so I can probably get all
the wood I need for, ya know,

20:01.367 --> 20:03.797
at least the next
several days.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.567
When I first moved
off‐grid in Alaska,

20:07.807 --> 20:09.407
I had never used an
axe or saw before,

20:09.442 --> 20:11.642
I just learned it
all trial and error,

20:11.677 --> 20:13.907
and it’s something
I’ve done a lot.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.080
Oh, there you go.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.155
Wasn’t much holding that.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.692
There’s like the skills
humans had, you know,

20:25.725 --> 20:28.865
500,000 years ago
to survive, same thing.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.631
If you use them
today, you’ll survive.

20:31.664 --> 20:32.734
You know?

20:32.765 --> 20:34.975
But, you know, if I worked
in a city or whatever,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.340
I feel like it’s actually
less certain there, you know?

20:37.369 --> 20:38.999
So hard to make a living
and so hard to like,

20:39.038 --> 20:40.538
know what to do.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.943
What career path
should I choose?

20:42.975 --> 20:44.175
Everything’s
constantly changing,

20:44.210 --> 20:46.010
you know what I mean?

20:46.045 --> 20:48.215
Nature is
consistent, you know?

20:48.247 --> 20:50.877
The rules of nature’s game
never change, so, you know,

20:50.916 --> 20:52.616
as long as you’re
willing to play by them.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.351
That’s, that’s about
as secure as you get.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.558
This is great.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.590
I got a really
good pile of wood.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.055
And then, yeah, I think
I’ve got enough time left

21:01.093 --> 21:02.063
in the day.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.164
I can go down and
get some water.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.274
And then I’m, I’m set.

21:10.770 --> 21:15.140

21:20.746 --> 21:23.716
Some ice here doesn’t got
too much snow on top of it.

21:23.749 --> 21:27.789
So, this’ll be an easy
place to get it from.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.791
You know one of the big
difficulties about Bear Creek,

21:31.824 --> 21:34.394
it was such a
big chore to get water,

21:34.426 --> 21:36.126
so I always having to
really ration my water and

21:36.162 --> 21:37.662
never had quite enough.

21:37.696 --> 21:40.396
Here, I’m gonna have all
the water I could ever want.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.073
Super excited about it.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.772
I just gotta be more careful.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.878
Making little mistakes here,
there’s just not gonna be a

21:51.911 --> 21:54.551
recourse to fix it if
it gets out of hand.

22:02.955 --> 22:05.725

22:06.125 --> 22:07.735

important around here,

22:07.760 --> 22:09.230
are mine and my wife’s.

22:11.230 --> 22:12.900
I remember coming out
here as a kid with my dad and

22:12.932 --> 22:14.432
crossing over this.

22:14.466 --> 22:16.866
And we had two big beams in
that were crossed with a bunch

22:16.902 --> 22:18.302
of smaller beams.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.367
JESSI: Well, that was
when it was half as deep

22:21.407 --> 22:23.137

we shovel enough snow in.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.018

22:39.959 --> 22:41.059

22:41.093 --> 22:43.163
you know it’s just too far
across to build the bridge.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.655

22:44.697 --> 22:47.067

have to just make ramps.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.440

is the old trail.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.899
Uh, it goes out this
way down to the Tanana.

23:25.938 --> 23:28.338
So, I think that we should
just build right here.

23:28.374 --> 23:32.084
I mean looking down
the hard part is gonna be
getting back up over there.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.611
That’s gonna be tough.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.846
JESSI: That other side?
CHRIS: Yeah.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.787

to split the tasks,

23:45.391 --> 23:49.131
and I’m shoveling a bunch
of snow down into Deep Creek.

23:49.695 --> 23:53.675
And Chris is gonna go and cut
some trees to make some poles.

23:55.134 --> 23:58.704
We’re gonna be using this
ramp very frequently,

23:58.737 --> 24:01.507
and there’s gonna be thousands
of pounds going across it.

24:01.540 --> 24:04.980
It’s very important that we
do it right the first time.

24:06.378 --> 24:10.048
I think it’s gonna
take 40, 40 sled fulls.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.517

40:56.988 --> 40:59.388
and predators means
there’s prey somewhere.

41:00.391 --> 41:02.961
We’ll see if this fox
has any good luck for us.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.664
BRITTANY: Cool.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.270
KALEB: I think I
see ptarmigan tracks up there.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.302
BRITTANY: Ooh.

41:14.238 --> 41:16.068
KALEB: Keep it quiet.

41:18.843 --> 41:21.683
All right so, I
found ptarmigan tracks here.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.053
They’re old though.

41:23.081 --> 41:26.051
These tracks have that
dusting of snow on ’em.

41:26.084 --> 41:27.354
BRITTANY: Hmm.

41:27.385 --> 41:28.825
KALEB: So, they were here.

41:28.853 --> 41:32.093
Hopefully, the farther we
go the fresher they get.

41:33.157 --> 41:36.057
Oh, here’s a spot where
a ptarmigan landed and

41:36.094 --> 41:38.934
made a little runway.

41:38.963 --> 41:41.403
They just kinda stick their
belly out and just kinda

41:41.432 --> 41:43.672
ker‐flop into the snow.

41:45.203 --> 41:47.813
BRITTANY: Let’s go, Piper.

41:54.979 --> 41:55.949
KALEB: Oh, hey, Brit.

41:55.980 --> 41:58.920
Brit!

41:59.517 --> 42:01.047
I might see one.

42:01.085 --> 42:02.015
Piper!

42:02.053 --> 42:03.693
Piper, come here.

42:05.523 --> 42:06.523
Oye.

42:06.557 --> 42:08.687
BRITTANY:
Where do you see one?

42:09.360 --> 42:11.230
KALEB: Above that
big spruce tree there.

42:11.262 --> 42:13.262
He’s just sitting up there.

42:13.664 --> 42:15.174
BRITTANY: I think I’m
gonna inch up on it.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.699
How about you and
Piper stay here?

42:16.734 --> 42:18.344
KALEB: Yep.

42:18.603 --> 42:20.003
Piper, you stay here.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.068
BRITTANY: Okay.

42:21.105 --> 42:23.935
KALEB: Momma’s
gonna try to get a ptarmigan.

42:25.643 --> 42:27.553
BRITTANY: How close do
you think I can get?

42:27.578 --> 42:29.378
KALEB: 15 feet.
They’re pretty dumb.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.321
BRITTANY: Okay.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.558
KALEB: Stay, Piper. Stay.

42:42.693 --> 42:43.893
(gunshot)

42:43.895 --> 42:47.975

KALEB: Did you get it?
BRITTANY: I think so.

46:14.872 --> 46:15.972
KALEB: I think Brittany
got a ptarmigan.

46:16.007 --> 46:17.907
Let’s go get it.
Let’s go get it.

46:18.242 --> 46:20.242
BRITTANY: Oh, man.

46:20.278 --> 46:22.048
I definitely got it.

46:22.079 --> 46:23.709
KALEB: Definitely got him.

46:23.748 --> 46:25.478
Good job, babe.

46:25.850 --> 46:27.820
Tipped him right over.

46:28.052 --> 46:29.192
BRITTANY: Look at that!

46:29.220 --> 46:31.050
KALEB: Nice neck shot.

46:31.088 --> 46:33.218
BRITTANY: Look
how plump that is.

46:33.257 --> 46:35.957
Especially for it
to be in the winter.

46:36.994 --> 46:38.804
So, that’s exciting.

46:38.829 --> 46:40.529
KALEB: I see why
the fox is here.

46:40.564 --> 46:43.134
He’s after them
fat little ptarmigans.

46:43.467 --> 46:45.897
In moose terms, we’d be
talking a 60‐inch bull.

46:45.936 --> 46:47.266
So, nice job.

46:47.305 --> 46:49.945
BRITTANY: Nice haul, right?
KALEB: Nice job.
BRITTANY: Thanks.

46:50.141 --> 46:51.581
KALEB: First
ptarmigan in the bag.

46:51.609 --> 46:52.779
BRITTANY: Yeah.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.340
Let’s start a fire
and roast this thing.

46:54.378 --> 46:55.348
KALEB: Sounds good.

46:55.379 --> 46:56.779
Do you wanna lead or
do you want me to?

46:56.814 --> 46:58.554
BRITTANY: I will let you lead.
KALEB: Yep.

46:58.582 --> 47:00.152
BRITTANY: Thank you.

47:02.453 --> 47:04.923
And that is why
I handed him that.

47:07.425 --> 47:08.735
Dude!

47:09.894 --> 47:11.134
KALEB: Stuck in the hole!

47:11.162 --> 47:12.602
BRITTANY: Oh dear.

47:14.865 --> 47:16.325
JOHNNY: I don’t
think there’s any such thing as

47:16.367 --> 47:18.267
exploring in a city.

47:18.302 --> 47:20.742
Everywhere in the city
has been discovered.

47:21.672 --> 47:24.612
I like to explore
places that are isolated and

47:24.642 --> 47:26.182
removed from society.

47:26.911 --> 47:28.711
And to me, that’s exploration.

47:34.785 --> 47:38.315
That cold air just
crystalizes my lungs.

47:40.024 --> 47:41.794
It’s hard to breathe.

47:43.694 --> 47:46.834
See if the wolves or the
cold temperatures got to the

47:46.864 --> 47:49.134
caribou before I did.

47:49.433 --> 47:51.033
I urinated all around it,

47:51.068 --> 47:53.368
and I know that wolves don’t
like the scent of humans.

47:53.404 --> 47:55.574
So, I’m kind of hoping
that that’ll keep them

47:55.606 --> 47:57.306
away from it.

47:59.477 --> 48:01.807
Ah, thank God
nothing got to it.

48:01.846 --> 48:03.476
That’s a huge relief.

48:05.015 --> 48:08.485
I just gotta figure out
if it’s frozen, and, um,

48:08.519 --> 48:10.089
I need to dig it out.

48:10.721 --> 48:13.121
The sun’s up for
just a couple hours,

48:13.858 --> 48:15.728
so I don’t know if that
snow that I packed around

48:15.760 --> 48:17.130
the caribou’s actually
going to insulate it and

48:17.161 --> 48:19.001
keep it from freezing.

48:20.731 --> 48:22.401
There’s part of it.

48:22.433 --> 48:24.903
Look at that, it’s so cold
that it stuck so much that

48:24.935 --> 48:28.135
it’s taking the hair
off the caribou.

48:28.973 --> 48:31.013
That’s not feeling frozen.

48:31.041 --> 48:32.511
That is awesome.

48:32.543 --> 48:34.013
There’s no way I’d be
able to butcher it up,

48:34.044 --> 48:36.654
I’d have to thaw
it out in my cabin.

48:36.680 --> 48:38.980
That’d be a big mess.

48:39.016 --> 48:42.486
When the summer rolls around,
you know bears will definitely

48:42.520 --> 48:44.860
smell that, so I don’t wanna
bring a whole caribou to my

48:44.889 --> 48:47.159
cabin now if I don’t have to.

48:47.558 --> 48:49.058
Now I gotta start
butchering it because it’s

48:49.093 --> 48:50.493
exposed to the air.

48:50.528 --> 48:52.098
These cold temperatures
these things are gonna freeze

48:52.129 --> 48:54.359
in no time.

48:56.233 --> 48:59.643
You know, this is my
food source out here.

48:59.670 --> 49:02.270
I save all the parts,
I utilize everything.

49:03.240 --> 49:04.570
You know, I don’t
enjoy killing.

49:04.608 --> 49:05.638
I never have.

49:05.676 --> 49:07.276
It’s not a good feeling,

49:07.311 --> 49:10.511
but what is good is
being part of the cycle

49:10.548 --> 49:12.378
of life and death.

49:12.416 --> 49:16.886
Being the meat eater I am,
it’s important for me to play

49:16.921 --> 49:20.021
a role in life and death.

49:21.692 --> 49:24.592
That was a big goal of mine,
moving to Alaska,

49:24.628 --> 49:28.498
was to never buy factory
farmed meat again.

49:28.532 --> 49:31.272
But I’m also not a vegetarian.

49:32.703 --> 49:35.143
This caribou will last
me about six weeks.

49:36.807 --> 49:38.237
Brisket.

49:38.275 --> 49:40.175
It’s a lot of
effort to put in.

49:40.211 --> 49:42.411
The ravens will come
and clean that up.

49:42.646 --> 49:44.146
In the long run it pays off.

49:44.515 --> 49:45.925
Oh, yeah!

49:47.985 --> 49:51.655
Damn, any exposure to the skin,
you feel it real quick.

49:53.357 --> 49:54.887
It’s no joke.

49:58.062 --> 49:59.502
JESSI: I can do
anything I want out here,

49:59.530 --> 50:01.870
and I get to depend on myself.

50:02.166 --> 50:04.496
And that’s something that
I never felt in the city.

50:05.102 --> 50:07.902
JESSI: There’s always somebody
that you have to answer to.

50:08.472 --> 50:10.042
All of that is just gone.

50:14.011 --> 50:16.451
CHRIS: I’m a little
nervous looking down this.

50:16.480 --> 50:18.550
Once we get this through,
I can get to town,

50:18.582 --> 50:20.622
I can get supplies,
I can bring plywood.

50:20.651 --> 50:23.451
I can bring tin,
we can bring fuel.

50:23.487 --> 50:26.357
But I’m afraid of like,
the SnoGo starting to go and

50:26.390 --> 50:28.830
sliding off the side and
just running right into that

50:28.859 --> 50:31.659
big mud bank down there.

50:32.229 --> 50:34.459
JESSI: How wide do you
think it is right there?

50:34.498 --> 50:36.028
CHRIS: Just wide enough.

50:36.066 --> 50:38.866
I mean, at least our
SnoGo is pretty skinny.

50:38.903 --> 50:41.103
You know, I guess as
time progresses so does,

50:41.138 --> 50:43.168
so does the bridge.

50:43.207 --> 50:45.437
I remember looking over the
side of this creaky bridge as

50:45.476 --> 50:48.006
a kid and watching like,
snow fall as we crossed it.

50:48.045 --> 50:49.505
JESSI: Thinking
that was sketch.

50:49.547 --> 50:50.947
CHRIS: Thinking
that that was scary,

50:50.981 --> 50:54.381
and now here I am
looking at this super
steep angle thinking,

50:54.418 --> 50:56.648
wow am I gonna
be able to make it up this?

50:56.687 --> 50:58.657
But...

51:00.591 --> 51:02.531
JESSI: Meet ya on
the other side.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.160
CHRIS: Wish me luck.

51:07.431 --> 51:10.531
There’s endless things we can
do once we get through this.

51:11.368 --> 51:12.568
I know it’s been
a lot of work,

51:12.603 --> 51:14.743
but the payoff is
gonna be worth it.

51:14.972 --> 51:17.272
Woo! Man, that’s steep!

51:18.375 --> 51:21.545
As long as I don’t
wreck my snow machine.

52:03.654 --> 52:04.554
Oh my,

52:35.352 --> 52:38.122
I was like, ´Somebody needs

52:40.724 --> 52:43.360

I was like, ´Of course!‘

52:43.360 --> 52:45.129
‐Have an awesome day up ahead.
‐Thank you!

52:45.129 --> 52:47.529
‐Thank you all for choosing

‐Alright, thank you.

52:47.531 --> 52:49.531

been to Wilmington

53:48.759 --> 53:50.559
Well, GEICO‘s 85 years

53:50.561 --> 53:52.461
isn‘t just about
time, you know.

53:52.463 --> 53:54.563
It means experience.

53:54.565 --> 53:56.033
I mean, put it this way.

53:56.033 --> 53:58.268
If I told you I‘d been
jarring raspberry preserves

53:58.268 --> 53:59.968
for 85 years,
what would you think?

53:59.970 --> 54:01.300
(Humming)

54:01.305 --> 54:02.806
Well, at first
you‘d be like,

54:02.806 --> 54:05.036
"That has gotta be
some scrumptious jam!"

54:05.042 --> 54:06.442
(Humming)

54:06.443 --> 54:10.113
And then you‘d think,
"He looks fantastic!

54:10.114 --> 54:11.824
I must know his
skin care routine."

On it, with JARDIANCE.

<i>JARDIANCE is a once‐daily pill</i>

55:15.312 --> 55:17.012
<i>Ask your doctor
about JARDIANCE.</i>

55:52.883 --> 55:54.923
(Chris laughs)

55:54.952 --> 56:00.292
CHRIS: All right!
JESSI: Yeah!
CHRIS: Woohoo!

56:01.925 --> 56:05.195
JESSI: Our bridge
across Deep Creek is a lot
more like two snow ramps.

56:06.230 --> 56:08.500
But it’s a lot less
steep than it was before.

56:09.399 --> 56:11.469
This is where it’s
gonna get sketch.

56:12.035 --> 56:13.495
Here he comes.

56:21.245 --> 56:23.015
Yeah!

56:27.017 --> 56:29.247
CHRIS: Ah, (bleep) yeah!

56:29.286 --> 56:30.346
Woo!

56:30.387 --> 56:31.617
(laughs)

56:31.655 --> 56:32.695
Give me some of that!

56:32.723 --> 56:33.893
JESSI: Good job!

56:33.924 --> 56:36.734
Being able to go down and come
back up first try is a big

56:36.760 --> 56:38.660
success for us.

56:38.695 --> 56:40.495
You didn’t even touch
this whole spot.

56:40.530 --> 56:42.700
CHRIS: I was just going!

56:43.033 --> 56:46.643
JESSI: I can go from my
doorway here at the Cosna to

56:46.670 --> 56:49.310
the village of Manley
in like four hours.

56:50.374 --> 56:53.314
In Alaska standards,
that is faster than the

56:53.343 --> 56:55.113
speed of light.

56:55.145 --> 56:57.345
This is a working bridge.

56:59.182 --> 57:01.052
KALEB: What’s this
sign we saw once?

57:01.618 --> 57:03.448
’A life well lived you
should be skidding in

57:03.487 --> 57:06.217
sideways half‐drunk
with a bottle of wine’,

57:06.256 --> 57:07.356
something like that.

57:07.391 --> 57:09.191
I can’t remember
how the saying went.

57:09.226 --> 57:11.286
BRITTANY: That sounds,
not great actually.

57:11.328 --> 57:13.628
KALEB: That’s the one that
your mom had on her fridge.

57:15.933 --> 57:18.033
100% organic food here.

57:20.170 --> 57:22.470
BRITTANY: If you had asked me
when I was in high school if

57:22.506 --> 57:24.266
I’d ever do any of the
things that we’re doing

57:24.308 --> 57:26.808
it probably would have been a
big laugh and a no.

57:28.045 --> 57:32.355
But I think we’re becoming
more partners when it comes to

57:32.382 --> 57:34.152
the outdoor stuff, too.

57:34.184 --> 57:36.294
KALEB: I agree.

57:36.320 --> 57:38.520
Here you go, here’s a leg.

57:40.023 --> 57:42.493
Not bad for cooking
over a campfire.

57:43.894 --> 57:45.464
BRITTANY: Mm‐hmm.

57:45.495 --> 57:46.825
KALEB: Piper,
you want a goody?

57:46.863 --> 57:48.573
There you go.

57:49.099 --> 57:51.899
Been a lot of firsts for
you on this trip, Brittany.

57:51.935 --> 57:53.865
You did a fantastic
job with the chainsaw,

57:54.404 --> 57:55.474
with the ptarmigan.

57:55.505 --> 57:57.165
BRITTANY: Thanks.

57:57.207 --> 57:59.837
KALEB: I think, uh, firewood’s
your job from now on.

57:59.876 --> 58:02.076
You did such a
great job of it.

58:03.513 --> 58:06.153
If things keep up, I’m gonna
be sitting at home knitting

58:06.183 --> 58:07.923
while you go out and
get the ptarmigan.

58:09.453 --> 58:11.653
BRITTANY: I don’t know
that you would ever want to

58:11.688 --> 58:13.018
sit and knit.

58:13.056 --> 58:15.386
KALEB: This is true,
I would die if I did that.

58:18.128 --> 58:20.958
ALEX: Okay.
Get myself a table here.

58:22.432 --> 58:25.472
I got kind of my most
primary needs taken care of,

58:25.502 --> 58:28.142
but you know this
morning I woke up it was

58:28.171 --> 58:29.711
probably like 3:00 AM.

58:29.740 --> 58:32.780
And I was cold, I was covered
in ice, and I was like,

58:32.809 --> 58:35.849
legit like I need to be
able to heat my tent.

58:37.681 --> 58:39.421
I’m looking forward to
getting to know this place as

58:39.449 --> 58:41.679
intimately as I
know Bear Creek.

58:42.486 --> 58:44.416
I just wish Sipsy was here.

58:44.454 --> 58:46.194
It’s both a blessing
and a curse,

58:46.223 --> 58:48.263
you know I don’t
have to worry.

58:48.291 --> 58:50.291
At the same time,
I do miss him.

58:50.660 --> 58:52.960
Okay, we just about got it.

58:52.996 --> 58:55.096
I got the box assembled,
that’s the hard part.

58:55.132 --> 58:57.572
Now all I got to do is
put it inside my tent.

58:58.702 --> 59:01.202
Everything that lives here
has to live with intent,

59:01.238 --> 59:03.468
with courage, with endurance.

59:04.708 --> 59:07.938
From the trees, the little
rodents, everything.

59:07.978 --> 59:09.048
And not just once, you know,

59:09.079 --> 59:10.379
it’s not like oh you have
your right of passage and

59:10.414 --> 59:12.354
then you cruise after that.

59:12.382 --> 59:16.252
Every single
winter is that test.

59:16.286 --> 59:18.386
60 degrees.

59:20.624 --> 59:23.934
JOHNNY: If I had to, you know,
go back in time and teach myself

59:23.960 --> 59:27.660
everything that I know now it
would be a ten‐minute lesson.

59:29.132 --> 59:31.572
Because it’s really
not about, you know,

59:31.601 --> 59:33.441
use this gear
instead of that gear.

59:35.505 --> 59:37.935
Learn to use your
eyes and ears,

59:37.974 --> 59:39.444
nature will teach
you everything.

59:46.850 --> 59:48.650
All right, you wanna
eat some tongue or what?

59:48.685 --> 59:50.145
Where’s the tongue
at, over there?

59:50.187 --> 59:51.847
Yeah, I thought so.

59:52.089 --> 59:53.789
Let’s have a peek.

59:54.491 --> 59:55.761
If it wasn’t for the caribou,

59:55.792 --> 59:56.962
I wouldn’t be able
to survive out here.

59:56.993 --> 59:58.863
There’s just no
way I’d be able to.

59:58.895 --> 1:00:02.225
I don’t know when the next
herd’s gonna come through.

1:00:02.265 --> 1:00:04.025
So, I have to capitalize
on the caribou that

1:00:04.067 --> 1:00:05.897
do come through.

1:00:07.737 --> 1:00:10.267
Do you know we’re
reaching negative 60’s.

1:00:10.574 --> 1:00:12.984
And when you’re reaching
temperatures like that,

1:00:13.009 --> 1:00:16.479
there is no such thing
as failure out here.

1:00:17.814 --> 1:00:19.424
But there is death.

1:00:19.449 --> 1:00:20.549
(sizzle)

1:00:20.584 --> 1:00:22.494
Oh yeah, sounds good.

1:00:22.519 --> 1:00:25.319
You need to stay present
in this lifestyle.

1:00:25.555 --> 1:00:27.715
That’s the sound of
success right there.

1:00:28.959 --> 1:00:31.229
If you let your mind drift
too much it’s really,

1:00:31.261 --> 1:00:35.601
really easy to go down
a dark hole being alone,

1:00:35.899 --> 1:00:37.929
especially in the cold.

1:00:38.768 --> 1:00:41.668
Takes a strong mind and
somebody that’s willing to

1:00:41.705 --> 1:00:43.545
reflect on their life,

1:00:44.875 --> 1:00:47.185
look at themselves
and decide whether or not

1:00:47.210 --> 1:00:49.810
they want to push the
boundaries, push the limits.

1:00:50.113 --> 1:00:53.623
JOHNNY: Live ways that
people aren’t living anymore.

1:00:56.019 --> 1:00:58.889
Java, you ready to eat, girl?

1:01:02.192 --> 1:01:03.832
You’re always ready to eat.

1:01:04.060 --> 1:01:06.400
If we had one thing in
common, it would be that.

1:01:06.863 --> 1:01:07.963
Okay.

1:01:07.998 --> 1:01:10.998
That’s my efforts right there.

1:01:11.868 --> 1:01:13.898
Ah, so good.
