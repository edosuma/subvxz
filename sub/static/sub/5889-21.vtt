WEBVTT

00:02.520 --> 00:04.887
It's time to bring NSA surveillance state
to an end.

00:05.080 --> 00:06.650
FISA courts are rubber stamped...

00:06.840 --> 00:09.040
...to trample on
your Fourth Amendment right to privacy.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.566
- Sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.808
- You all right?
- My fault.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.485
"Kill the Patriot Act."
It's never gonna happen.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.924
- The best we can hope for is...
- Fix section 215. I know.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.771
Hyperbole piques their interest,
then go in for the kill.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.488
- We could use more petitions like this.
- Oh, thank you.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.690
Your involvement means more
than you know.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.842
Yes. We've achieved customization.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.485
Initiate phase two.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.767
♪ It seems like a mighty long time ♪

01:56.160 --> 01:58.049
♪ I'm so glad ♪

02:00.440 --> 02:03.364
♪ You stopped by to say hello ♪

02:03.600 --> 02:05.284
Did you know that this diner...

02:05.520 --> 02:08.000
...claims to have the third
best cup of coffee in D.C.

02:08.199 --> 02:13.491
Look, last night, me coming
by your place like that and...

02:13.680 --> 02:16.729
Liz, I want to say something.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.445
Don't, please.

02:19.280 --> 02:22.887
Can't you just tell me about your boat?
I mean, whatever the other thing is...

02:23.120 --> 02:27.728
...I'm sure that it's probably best for
both of us if you just keep it to yourself.

02:27.960 --> 02:32.363
- I'm sorry. I just wanna say I'm sorry.
- Tom, we're way past that.

02:32.560 --> 02:36.007
I know, but I'm not asking
for your forgiveness.

02:36.200 --> 02:40.330
I just want to apologize because
I should have done it a long time ago.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.204
What's the catch?

02:44.680 --> 02:46.603
There's no catch.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.089
It's just a little hope.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.565
- Hope?
- Mm-hm.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.843
That we'll just work through
this screwed-up situation we're in...

02:55.040 --> 02:58.044
...and go back to playing house?
- All right, dream scenario.

02:58.280 --> 03:02.968
We finish our coffee, we hop on my boat,
we leave, okay? We never look back.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.090
Preferably, we take our clothes off
at some point.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.010
- Be serious.
- I am trying to be.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.329
That's insane.
I don't know you, not the real you.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.568
The fact that you think
I'm gonna run away...

03:14.760 --> 03:16.967
...means that you don't know me at all,
either.

03:17.160 --> 03:21.006
You must be the toast,
bacon extra crispy, tea, 2 percent.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.690
Thank you.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.406
I thought you'd be hungry.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.970
- Just because I'm eating...
- I know the whole naked boat thing...

03:29.160 --> 03:32.721
...is a little unrealistic,
but we both need to start over, right?

03:33.600 --> 03:36.570
You and me. The real me, not...

03:36.760 --> 03:38.205
The neo-Nazi?

03:38.440 --> 03:42.365
- Because that doesn't really do it for me.
- That's fair.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.805
- Reddington.
- Don't.

03:48.880 --> 03:53.283
- Tom.
- Try calling me Jacob.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.164
I have to go.

04:21.320 --> 04:25.530
I know you think he knows something,
but I wouldn't bet the double-wide.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.200
My guess?
The boy don't know doodle.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.926
Oh, the boy knows more than doodle,
Brimley.

04:35.800 --> 04:40.442
I've received information from my sources
confirming that Karakurt is in country.

04:40.640 --> 04:45.851
I'm gonna need a bag of dry ice
and 5 feet of vinyl garden hose.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.165
That poor fellow's an aide
at the Russian consulate...

04:53.360 --> 04:55.806
...and a loyal errand boy for the Cabal.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.921
I believe he's the one
who provided Karakurt with a go-bag...

05:00.120 --> 05:03.841
...upon his arrival in the States.
- There's something I wanna make clear.

05:04.040 --> 05:08.762
Karakurt is known in the intelligence
community as the left hand of the SVR.

05:08.960 --> 05:12.407
Not enough for you to tell me my mother
was KGB and I was born in Russia.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.649
Truth, he works for the Cabal.
They smuggled him into America...

05:15.840 --> 05:18.605
...because they know
if he commits an act of terror here...

05:18.800 --> 05:20.325
...the government will blame Moscow.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.490
My mother and father, who they are,
what happened in the fire...

05:23.680 --> 05:26.445
...I'm gonna find out the truth.
- I'm sure you will, Lizzy.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.570
But listen to me.
The Cabal is orchestrating...

05:29.800 --> 05:32.485
I get it. The Cabal is trying
to start another cold war...

05:32.720 --> 05:36.088
...and an act of terror committed here
is step one in making that happen.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.443
I am listening to what you are saying,
I know that it's important.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.120
But it is no more important
than what I am telling you.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.601
And I need you to listen to that.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.808
There will be an attack
on an American defense installation...

05:55.040 --> 05:57.202
...within a matter of days.

05:57.400 --> 06:02.327
If I'm right, it'll be the first of many
acts of terror here and overseas...

06:02.520 --> 06:05.046
...designed by the Cabal
to further their agenda.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.130
We have to stop this man, Lizzy.

06:09.200 --> 06:13.842
January, 2009, Stanislav Markelov,
a celebrated human rights lawyer...

06:14.040 --> 06:17.726
...known for his criticism of the regime,
is gunned down in Moscow.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.241
The Russians blamed neo-Nazi youth.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.962
But German intelligence suggests
it was Karakurt...

06:24.160 --> 06:27.004
...acting on orders from the SVR.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.811
Four years later, Boris Berezovsky...

06:30.000 --> 06:34.005
...another vocal critic of the regime,
was found dead of an alleged suicide.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.881
Again, intelligence sources indicate
the death was staged by the Kremlin.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.249
Is Reddington saying that the SVR
has sent a terrorist to America?

06:41.440 --> 06:43.841
No, that's what the Cabal
wants us to think.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.361
Whatever Karakurt was sent here
to do...

06:46.560 --> 06:50.281
...the American government will believe
that it was on behalf of Russia.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.768
It's a false-flag operation,
meant to strain relations.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.560
Reddington said that Karakurt's target
was a defense installation.

06:56.640 --> 06:59.689
- Did he identify which one?
- No, but I think he might have a lead.

06:59.880 --> 07:03.043
- He's being tight-lipped about it.
- Why? We're trying to help him.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.368
Reddington doesn't trust our security.

07:05.560 --> 07:09.167
Thinks we've been bleeding information
since before the attempt on his life.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.768
We're not waiting on Reddington.
I've already reached out to Langley...

07:12.960 --> 07:16.521
...set up a consult with the CIA's Office
of Russian and European Analysis.

07:16.720 --> 07:20.088
This Karakurt must be on their radar.
Find out what they know.

07:26.240 --> 07:30.165
- Mr. Masik.
- How's it going? Marshall.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.408
Donald Ressler. Elizabeth Keen.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.001
That was Kilpatrick.
He's on his way down.

07:35.200 --> 07:39.569
Man, you guys certainly got his attention.
Whole team's coming down to hear this.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.924
Kilpatrick's tough.
Do not take anything he says personal.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.122
Let's go.
Everyone stop what you're doing.

07:46.360 --> 07:49.921
It's our lucky day. The good people
of the FBI have decided to enlighten us.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.885
Kilpatrick.
I spoke to Harold Cooper just now.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.048
- He sent over a situation brief.
- Ressler.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.328
We appreciate you guys
extending yourself.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.124
Where'd you get your information?

07:59.320 --> 08:02.210
A high-level informant.
One who's proven very reliable.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.129
Karakurt.

08:04.320 --> 08:08.086
Sure? Because you're talking to people
who run Russian counterintelligence...

08:08.280 --> 08:12.080
...and we don't have one shred of
credible information that he's in country.

08:12.280 --> 08:16.683
Well, that's why we're here, to share
our credible information with you.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.450
We were hoping you'd do the same.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.284
Look, you have your hooks
in the Russian community.

08:20.440 --> 08:24.365
Right. And if their top assassin is here,
you can bet your badge we'd know it.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.045
He's here.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.290
We have reason to believe he's planning
an attack on defense installations soon.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.650
If civilians die because you're bent out of
shape whether source was FBI or CIA...

08:34.840 --> 08:36.683
You asked for our assessment.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.726
No. We asked for your help.
Where does he go? Who's he meet with?

08:40.919 --> 08:42.683
He needs a place to stay, a vehicle.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.962
- We'll ask around.
- Ask around? That's it?

08:45.160 --> 08:47.208
Stars carved in the marble
at Langley...

08:47.400 --> 08:51.246
...represent colleagues of ours
who died drawing intel on Karakurt.

08:51.440 --> 08:54.046
Nobody wants him more than we do.

08:54.240 --> 08:57.005
We'll look into your lead
and let you know.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.809
Hey, guys, wait up.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.485
Like I said, the guy's not exactly
the warm and fuzzy type.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.762
- The guy's a prick.
- He's actually not.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.007
Overworked, yeah.

09:13.440 --> 09:17.001
Underappreciated, definitely.
Alcoholic, probably.

09:17.240 --> 09:20.005
Killy's been working Russians
ever since they were Soviets.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.607
What he doesn't know,
somebody he knows does.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.805
The truth is,
we reviewed what you sent on Karakurt.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.089
It's as much as we've gathered
since he came on the radar in '03.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.567
You have nothing suggesting
that he's in the U.S.?

09:32.800 --> 09:34.006
Nothing solid.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.328
Kilpatrick has a Cl
here in Washington.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.648
Part of the Old Guard, hard-liner.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.046
Owns a restaurant now...

09:40.240 --> 09:42.766
...popular with some of
his ex-pat spy colleagues.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.122
He recorded a conversation for us
last night.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.891
Cryptic stuff.
We're not sure what it means yet.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.004
- Might be Karakurt?
- Fits with some of what you're looking for.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.568
- If you take this, didn't come from me.
- Thank you. We'll be in touch.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.171
Hey, can you help me with something?

10:01.120 --> 10:04.283
- Katarina Rostova, you heard of her?
- I don't know who that is...

10:04.480 --> 10:07.529
...but I doubt very seriously
that that is Katarina Rostova.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.087
I don't think there are photographs
of Katarina.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.601
- Why do you say that?
- She's a myth.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.320
Tall tales late at night
over vodka shots.

10:15.520 --> 10:19.366
Probably an amalgamation of a half a
dozen unknown female Soviet operatives.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.130
The Pinko Mata Hari.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.324
Your Cl works with the Old Guard.
Could you ask him about her?

10:24.560 --> 10:28.087
If anybody knows anything
about Katarina Rostova, he will.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.408
Send me a copy of your photo.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.443
I'll see what I can do.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.889
You were right to keep on him.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.526
The boy was tighter than my first wife.

10:42.720 --> 10:43.767
But I got an address.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.124
All clear.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.762
Ammonium nitrate.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.611
He's constructed
some kind of ANFO IED.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.962
He'll need a vehicle.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.926
Hello?

11:27.240 --> 11:29.242
- Hello.
- Hi.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.171
Is he still here?
The man who was in the room.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.681
I wanted to apologize
before he moved.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.161
My baby has colic
and was fussing all night.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.328
Oh, dear, you must be exhausted.

11:39.520 --> 11:40.931
Yeah, you have no idea.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.282
You'd be surprised.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.689
- The man, you talk to him?
- We pass in the hall, say hello.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.529
- I feel terrible.
- Oh, no. Don't be silly.

11:50.720 --> 11:55.487
If you could give me a call the next time
you see him, I would be ever so grateful.

11:55.680 --> 11:56.841
"Bill Houston."

11:57.040 --> 11:59.850
You're a private investigator?
He in some kind of trouble?

12:00.040 --> 12:02.691
According to the missus, always.
Gambling.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.288
He lost his daughter's college fund
playing Caribbean Stud...

12:06.480 --> 12:08.847
...left home in embarrassment,
Helen's worried sick.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.491
It's a mess.

12:10.680 --> 12:14.287
- You said he was moving?
- People here don't stay long.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.323
I saw him with a truck in the alley.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.760
What kind of truck?

12:18.120 --> 12:21.806
Reddington didn't give it to me.
I found it in one of the places he stays.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.322
- Think this is a photo of your mother?
- That's what Reddington told me.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.329
But that girl, that is definitely me.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.251
The agent, the Cl he mentioned?
That could be my chance...

12:30.440 --> 12:33.489
...to find out about the woman
holding me in that photo.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.331
Why would a Russian Cl
have information about your mother?

12:41.600 --> 12:43.045
- Ressler.
- Where are you?

12:43.280 --> 12:44.964
- Leaving the OREA.
- Reddington called.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.727
Karakurt is in possession of an ANFO
IED. We've identified the vehicle.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.321
It's a white moving truck
rented out of Annapolis...

12:51.520 --> 12:54.524
...plate number delta-kilo-5827.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.688
We're trying to ping the location now.

12:56.920 --> 13:00.288
They think Karakurt has a white
moving truck with explosives.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.371
- Oh, my God.
- Truck is parked right outside of OREA.

13:07.960 --> 13:11.089
- OREA is the target.
- Liz! Liz, look out, the truck!

13:36.600 --> 13:39.285
Crews continue the work
of sifting through the rubble.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.882
- The death toll stands at 14...
- An act of terror, plain and simple.

13:43.080 --> 13:46.323
As chairman of the Select Committee
on Intelligence, mark my words.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.648
We will find the people
who are responsible.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.969
- And when we do, we will respond...
- it's official. No survivors.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.640
I got something.
Security cam from a loading dock...

13:54.840 --> 13:56.285
...on 20th and Independence.

13:57.760 --> 14:02.402
It's not much, but let's send it wide,
see if we can't get lucky, get an ID.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.240
- Keen.
- You're okay.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.768
I was afraid you were inside.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.851
No, but those agents,
their entire section.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.889
Every agent on that desk
was wiped out.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.771
- If this gets traced back to Russia...
- Not "if," Lizzy.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.049
Senator Hawkins has taken the bait
like a bluegill to a cricket.

14:22.240 --> 14:25.289
And where he goes,
the warmongers are sure to follow.

14:25.480 --> 14:29.087
- Where are you on Karakurt?
- Where? Nowhere.

14:29.280 --> 14:33.001
The Cabal just took out
an entire substation of the CIA.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.328
Put a bullet in you,
you have no idea how.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.164
You're the most cautious person.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.523
The FBI couldn't find you for 20 years,
but they did.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.963
They're three steps ahead, that's
exactly what I'm gonna tell the AG.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.924
Tom Connolly is there?

14:46.120 --> 14:48.088
No, he's on his way.

14:48.320 --> 14:51.324
I assume he's expecting to be briefed.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.690
Connolly made the harbormaster
investigation go away.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.326
All we have on Karakurt
is a recording...

14:57.520 --> 14:59.682
...and a grainy photo
that's gotten us nowhere.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.803
- You have far more than that.
- Like what?

15:02.040 --> 15:05.169
I'm glad you're safe, Lizzy.
I'll be in touch.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.724
You want confirmation?
Turn on your damn television.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.361
The place is a crater.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.445
Give me thirty minutes
to change my location,

15:16.760 --> 15:18.842
then we discuss the next step.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.405
Mr. Houston?

15:32.600 --> 15:35.524
The man with the truck, he's back.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.561
Reddington has a location
for Karakurt.

15:39.760 --> 15:42.206
- 63rd and Franklin.
- Coordinate with HRT.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.409
Roll out now.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.203
We have a lead.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.650
We need to talk in your office.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.481
- Tom.
- You will ignore Reddington's lead.

16:00.680 --> 16:03.126
- Why? I'm sure it's solid.
- Harold, call your team.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.244
Tell them intel indicates the Russian
is at Union Station.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.122
Expect me to let Karakurt get away?
The man murdered government agents.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.648
- Finding him will not bring them back.
- What about his next target?

16:14.200 --> 16:16.771
How many lives will he take
before you let me do my job?

16:16.960 --> 16:19.725
Your job today is to divert your team
to Union Station...

16:19.920 --> 16:24.005
...or, God forbid,
your wife will pay the price.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.849
Charlene is a lovely woman...

16:28.680 --> 16:32.571
...who violated the Espionage Act
for you.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.763
Prison will not be kind to her.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.689
Harold, let him go.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.928
This is bigger than both of us.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.129
- Ressler.
- We have actionable intel...

16:46.320 --> 16:49.369
...that conflicts with Reddington's.
- But he had an eyewitness.

16:49.560 --> 16:53.360
Local P.D. got a hit off the credit card
Karakurt used to rent the truck.

16:53.560 --> 16:57.531
Card was used to purchase a train ticket
at Union Station. Redirect there now.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.449
Copy that.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.121
I knew you'd make the right play.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.641
Give Charlene my regards.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.324
Check the platforms.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.564
There you are.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.083
I've got eyes. Going through Gate D.

18:17.720 --> 18:18.926
Keen, what's your 20?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.562
- Hey, hang on. You okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.286
- What happened?
- He blind-sided me.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.164
Okay. Where did he go?

18:31.360 --> 18:33.124
I didn't see.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.241
Intelligence committee
is receiving live updates...

18:39.440 --> 18:42.444
...on the progress of the investigation
from the Justice Department.

18:42.680 --> 18:45.843
Evidence points to a deliberate,
sanctioned attack from Russia's SVR.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.963
Karakurt. He was there.
You're certain?

18:48.160 --> 18:50.925
He came around the corner.
I just got a glimpse of him.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.441
I was calling Ressler
when he knocked me down.

18:53.640 --> 18:54.846
Hey, guys, listen to this.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.963
From the recording
Agent Masik gave you.

18:58.280 --> 18:59.327
<i>Tell</i> me <i>it</i> worked.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.966
The proof of concept
succeeded as projected.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.960
- Initiate phase two.
- Done.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.130
I've identified the markers
for targeting and customization.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.642
- Whatever's happening's happening soon.
- What does he mean by "markers"?

19:10.840 --> 19:13.889
Could be referencing map coordinates,
some kind of radio beacon.

19:14.080 --> 19:17.209
Based on what Agent Masik told you,
we've figured out who the Cl is.

19:17.400 --> 19:21.610
He said the owner runs a restaurant in
D.C. that caters to the Soviet Old Guard.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.481
We reviewed ownership records for all
the Russian restaurants and found one.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.200
Ninoshka's.
The owner is former Spetsnaz.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.131
His name is Anton Velov.
My belief is, he's the Cl.

19:31.320 --> 19:34.210
Conversation was recorded
last night. We pulled the receipts...

19:34.440 --> 19:38.889
...and found a late dinner for two
paid for by a Leo Andropov.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.127
Dr. Leo Andropov.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.362
And you think he was meeting
with Karakurt?

19:42.560 --> 19:46.804
Andropov worked for the Soviet Defense
Ministry in the last months before glasnost.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.004
Whiz kid. When he was 16...

19:50.200 --> 19:53.807
...he published his only paper in
an open-source microbiology journal...

19:54.240 --> 19:57.084
...before he got snapped up
by the weapons ministry.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.406
Closet clear!

19:58.600 --> 20:02.002
I've seen equipment like this at the lab
at Quantico. A genotyping unit.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.565
It looks like Andropov fled.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.928
No passport, no ID,
no prescription drugs.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.930
Building fertilizer bombs
is way below this guy's pay grade.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.770
This can't be Karakurt's endgame.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.884
- Biological weapons?
- This guy's a virologist.

20:15.080 --> 20:18.402
If these are biological weapons,
then we may be looking at a pandemic.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.161
It always starts with a favor.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.567
I've known Tom Connolly
for two decades.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.330
He's had dinners at my house.

20:28.520 --> 20:32.411
And when he offered to help me get
into that drug trial, it was my only hope.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.605
It wasn't just your hope, Harold.
It was your wife's hope, your children's.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.610
You were given a terminal diagnosis...

20:39.840 --> 20:42.081
...and Connolly ends up
offering you a choice.

20:42.280 --> 20:45.090
Your life or your ethics,
and you picked your life.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.124
What good are ethics
if you aren't alive to live by them?

20:48.320 --> 20:50.721
If it was just me, my health, my life...

20:50.920 --> 20:53.605
...I would have told him to pound sand
a long time ago.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.041
When he dragged Charlene into it,
now this...

20:56.240 --> 21:00.450
...deliberately misdirecting my agents
to facilitate the escape of a terrorist.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.005
Now that's what's interesting.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.521
He orders you to send them
to Union Station...

21:04.720 --> 21:07.485
...ostensibly to throw them off
Karakurt's trail.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.762
And there he is.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.362
Perhaps Agent Keen was mistaken.

21:12.560 --> 21:15.006
And assaulted by a total stranger?

21:15.200 --> 21:18.727
That makes even less sense.
It was some kind of ambush.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.610
And I sent my people right into it.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.251
- And a good thing you did.
- What the hell does that mean?

21:24.440 --> 21:27.330
Thanks to your desire
to protect Charlene...

21:27.520 --> 21:29.727
...we're presented
with a unique opportunity...

21:29.920 --> 21:32.446
...to find out what the Cabal is up to.
- How?

21:32.680 --> 21:36.480
By continuing to follow Connolly's orders
without question.

21:36.680 --> 21:39.570
The last thing you should do
is confront him.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.127
Gather evidence, build a case.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.330
Tom Connolly's been leaking information
to the Cabal...

21:45.520 --> 21:47.807
...about everything that goes on
in this place...

21:48.000 --> 21:51.925
...ever since he walked through that door
and offered to save your life.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.848
You wanna wipe that debt clean?

21:55.080 --> 21:58.402
Keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

21:59.280 --> 22:02.329
We found a fully outfitted virology lab
in Andropov's apartment.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.290
Think he's building a bioweapon.

22:04.480 --> 22:07.927
We seized his notebooks, but we're
gonna need an expert in microbiology...

22:08.120 --> 22:10.088
...who can also translate Russian.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.930
Reddy bear. Oh, I could eat you alive.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.087
Mwah.

22:24.320 --> 22:27.164
Ginger, this is Dr. Lauren Kimberly.

22:27.400 --> 22:31.564
Lauren, my executive assistant,
Ginger Lumire.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.842
Mm. Interesting look.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.202
Purposeful, but still feminine.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.568
You should try a darker shade
of lipstick.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.569
I bet you could get away with a gloss.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.923
Lauren, we're going to have to forgo
the makeover today.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.805
- We're in a bit of a pinch.
- Understood.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.048
Let me see what I can do.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.842
I've got a lead on my mom.

22:55.040 --> 22:59.364
An OREA agent, he has a Cl who might
know something about Katarina Rostova.

22:59.600 --> 23:04.401
Dr. Kimberly was a tenured professor
doing genome research at Stanford...

23:04.600 --> 23:06.762
...when she was recruited
by the private sector.

23:07.200 --> 23:11.000
- I'm gonna find out the truth.
- She makes her real money consulting.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.480
Costs a fortune.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.967
She did, however,
let me name a lipstick color.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.043
"Fire in the Hole."

23:23.600 --> 23:26.809
You've reached
Elizabeth Keen. Please leave a message.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.049
Hi, Liz. This is, uh, Jacob.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.686
Jacob Phelps.
Look, I know things are complicated.

23:32.880 --> 23:35.087
I know you're going through
a bad breakup.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.921
From what I heard, guy's a total loser.
Couldn't cook, made crappy pancakes.

23:39.480 --> 23:45.044
So I wanted to see if you would join me
for dinner tomorrow. Uh...

23:45.240 --> 23:48.801
I made a reservation at 7 at this great
place on the corner of 32nd and M...

23:49.000 --> 23:51.401
...and I hope that you will come.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.085
Or not. But either way, I'll be there.

23:59.920 --> 24:02.161
You're right. It is a weapon.

24:02.360 --> 24:03.850
- WMD?
- No.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.491
A WID.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.648
A weapon of individual destruction.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.325
This is a customized virus...

24:09.520 --> 24:13.002
...synthesized with the sole intent
of killing one specific individual.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.531
How is that possible?

24:14.760 --> 24:16.967
He's created a supercharged rotavirus.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.286
These are very common.

24:18.480 --> 24:21.006
By the age of 5, most of us
have been infected multiple times.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.487
And with each infection,
we build up an immunity.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.444
So it's harmless to most people.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.563
All people. Precisely.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.967
But this rotavirus
has been customized...

24:30.160 --> 24:33.289
...keyed to infect one individual
with a unique genetic sequence...

24:33.480 --> 24:35.005
...and to devastating effect.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.641
According to animal trials logged
in these notes...

24:37.840 --> 24:41.049
...it attacks the central nervous system
within minutes of exposure.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.321
One person.

24:42.520 --> 24:45.569
- But who?
- I can only tell you what they're doing.

24:45.760 --> 24:51.324
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you
who they're doing it to.

25:02.240 --> 25:05.050
So we know Karakurt
is targeting one person...

25:05.240 --> 25:07.004
...and it's keyed to his or her DNA.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.725
Think.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.968
He bombed the CIA's Russian section.

25:11.160 --> 25:13.811
That took time, money,
and no small amount of risk.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.369
What happens when the United States
is attacked, suffers grievous loss of life?

25:18.560 --> 25:20.767
We go into lockdown.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.130
The bombing bumped the NTAS level
to red.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.767
But why put the mission at risk
by triggering a high-level terrorist alert?

25:28.000 --> 25:31.925
Well, that's the downside.
The upside is exposure, public attention.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.806
Remember, the people behind this
went to immense trouble and expense.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.766
- What does that say about their target?
- He's high-value.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.081
Someone important.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.489
Oh, my God, that's Why he did it.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.045
The memorial service.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.891
The victims will be memorialized
at a service...

25:53.080 --> 25:55.765
...at Ascension
and Saint Agnes church.

25:55.960 --> 25:59.851
Politicians and military personnel,
intelligence officers from overseas...

26:00.040 --> 26:04.409
...will all be there to pay their respects.
One of them is the target.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.481
So this is the guy?

26:11.680 --> 26:14.889
The best we can do. He's our prime
suspect in the OREA bombing...

26:15.080 --> 26:17.208
...and we believe
that he's not done yet.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.560
- We need your people to be on alert.
- Bomb?

26:19.720 --> 26:21.688
No. We'll be prepared
for that possibility.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.123
Our intel says he's after a specific
target. We don't know who yet.

26:25.320 --> 26:28.369
With this many people around,
I can't promise anything.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.922
- Safest play is to cancel the event.
- Believe me, we're working on it.

26:32.400 --> 26:35.961
Just spoke to Reven Wright. Calling off
the memorial service is a nonstarter.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.527
Mistake. We have hard evidence
of a clear threat.

26:38.720 --> 26:42.725
Main Justice is aware. Public's rattled
by this bombing, want a show of strength.

26:42.920 --> 26:45.924
If they cancel, it suggests
we can't protect our own people.

26:46.160 --> 26:49.403
Maybe we can't. We still don't know
exactly what we're dealing with.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.807
I'm dealing with
an impossible problem.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.646
So if you're counting on me
cracking this virus, don't.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.006
Well, what do you have?

26:56.200 --> 26:58.362
We found the formula
in Karakurt's apartment.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.847
So my plan was to reverse engineer
the process.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.008
We are trying millions
of DNA combinations.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.487
If I could figure out the profile
it was engineered to destroy...

27:05.720 --> 27:08.041
You could run the profile
through the DNA database.

27:08.240 --> 27:11.642
- A match is Karakurt's target.
- It won't work. Not in time.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.161
I need hours. Days, maybe.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.643
The memorial will be over long before
we can ID the target sequence.

27:17.840 --> 27:20.571
We have to assume Karakurt's
already infected himself...

27:20.760 --> 27:23.604
...with the contagion
and is a live carrier.

27:24.440 --> 27:28.411
Civilian and military security assets
have been marshaled for the service.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.968
The assassin is not armed
with something that we can flag...

27:32.160 --> 27:35.687
...with a metal detector.
The virus is transmitted through touch.

27:36.160 --> 27:37.764
It penetrates the skin.

27:37.960 --> 27:41.726
Even brushing up against the target
is enough to infect and kill him.

27:41.920 --> 27:46.244
It is critical that we nail Karakurt before
he can get anywhere near that church.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.920
Find him, people. Whatever it takes.

27:49.120 --> 27:52.966
- What are you thinking?
- Not me, Leonard. The Director.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.650
What is he thinking?

27:54.840 --> 27:58.481
His objective is to exacerbate tensions
with Russia.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.682
He chose to send Karakurt...

28:00.880 --> 28:03.326
...an assassin known to work
for the regime...

28:03.520 --> 28:05.921
...so people will assume
Russia is responsible.

28:06.160 --> 28:09.881
- So...
- So whoever he's targeting next...

28:10.120 --> 28:13.920
...will be an enemy of Russia,
an outspoken critic.

28:14.120 --> 28:18.444
Someone people will believe
the Russians would wanna silence.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.047
Hey, Keen! Keen!

28:33.240 --> 28:36.005
Sixty-seven guests have been cleared
to attend.

28:36.200 --> 28:41.001
There's Defense, Homeland, CIA,
the Bureau on this list.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.409
- Hard to narrow it down.
- Yeah. So much for the good old days...

28:44.600 --> 28:48.286
...where you could just look for the glint
of a sniper-rifle scope in a window.

28:48.480 --> 28:50.721
What does it do, this virus,
to the body?

28:50.920 --> 28:53.002
The CDC is still breaking it down.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.726
They're saying it attacks
the central nervous system.

28:55.960 --> 28:59.203
A victim would start shaking
within seconds of infection.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.882
Disorientation,
then labored breathing, convulsions.

29:03.080 --> 29:07.005
Incapacitation
within moments of contact.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.441
It's quite a remarkable feat
of engineering.

29:09.680 --> 29:14.208
In my experience, such accomplishments
don't happen overnight.

29:14.440 --> 29:16.204
You're saying they tested it first.

29:16.440 --> 29:22.129
A customized virus deadly
to such a small fraction of the population.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.807
What kind of trial and error
would prove useful?

29:26.800 --> 29:28.609
- This is Aram.
- Agent Mojtabai.

29:28.800 --> 29:33.044
I need a list of people admitted to
an emergency room in the last few days...

29:33.240 --> 29:36.483
...displaying symptoms consistent
with the virus you're tracking.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.762
That's not gonna be so easy
to put together.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.446
Aram,
that kind of catastrophic trauma...

29:41.640 --> 29:43.563
...would have gotten
someone's attention.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.404
It's on an autopsy chart somewhere.

29:45.600 --> 29:50.845
Okay, I hear you,
but you have to... Whoa. Whoa.

29:51.040 --> 29:54.249
Bethesda General sent tissue samples
to the CDC a few days ago.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.165
A suspicious death
of a college student.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.249
Center's just starting an investigation.

29:59.480 --> 30:03.405
I need that student's home address,
and I need to speak to Agent Navabi.

30:03.840 --> 30:06.605
Mrs. Jennings,
thank you for seeing me.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.882
I know
this is an extremely difficult time.

30:09.080 --> 30:12.004
I got a message from the CDC
about the investigation.

30:12.240 --> 30:15.403
But I didn't think they'd be sending
someone over so quickly.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.090
Can you tell me about Connor?

30:17.280 --> 30:18.406
What you know so far?

30:18.800 --> 30:20.484
Not much.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.330
Connor was a law student.

30:22.520 --> 30:25.091
I was told
he was walking across campus...

30:25.280 --> 30:29.763
...when he just started shaking
and then convulsing.

30:30.360 --> 30:34.524
One of the doctors suggested he may
have contracted a rare form of rotavirus?

30:34.840 --> 30:38.367
No, you're right to be thinking
this could be something else entirely.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.806
Perhaps malicious.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.047
Malicious?

30:41.240 --> 30:45.006
To be honest, Mrs. Jennings, your son
may have been intentionally infected.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.850
Is this because...?

30:47.040 --> 30:48.451
Is this because...?

30:49.400 --> 30:53.689
If Connor was targeted by someone
capable of this kind of attack...

30:53.880 --> 30:57.441
...it has to be connected to his father.
- His father?

30:59.800 --> 31:02.804
When I was a young staffer
on the Hill...

31:03.080 --> 31:05.606
...I had an affair with the man
I was working for.

31:05.840 --> 31:10.607
We were stupid, and I got pregnant.

31:11.880 --> 31:15.885
Even then, he had his eyes set
on a big political future...

31:16.080 --> 31:18.367
...so I agreed to go away.

31:18.600 --> 31:23.162
I made a deal
to receive ongoing support from him.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.607
Senator Hawkins. He's the target.

31:27.800 --> 31:30.929
They tested the virus on his son,
closest possible genetic match.

31:31.120 --> 31:34.329
You need to find the senator
before Karakurt does.

32:09.520 --> 32:13.366
Hey, Keen.
Samar's reaching out to Hawkins' office.

32:13.560 --> 32:16.006
He's not inside.
We got a shot of keeping him clear.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.001
I'll check the drive-ups.
Any word from Metro?

32:20.200 --> 32:22.521
Negative. If Karakurt's inside,
nobody's spotted him yet.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.210
Step up, please. Name?

32:24.920 --> 32:27.161
Flemming, European Wire.

32:34.480 --> 32:39.008
Flemming, press badge 6362.
We're gonna need to check the case.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.131
We're good.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.124
He's on the Main Justice press list.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.846
<i>It's time, Harold.</i>

32:56.040 --> 32:58.850
Call Tom Connolly. Tell him
you need to see him immediately.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.288
I'm assuming at the moment
he has no idea...

33:01.480 --> 33:05.371
...you've identified Karakurt's intended
victim, which is why you need to tell him.

33:05.560 --> 33:08.291
- Why would I do that?
- Because he'll be caught off guard.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.960
In addition
to enhancing your credibility with him...

33:11.160 --> 33:13.049
...it'll make him doubt
whether or not to move forward.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.765
Think he'll call off the attack?

33:14.960 --> 33:17.440
Worth the attempt.
The latest from Keen and Ressler?

33:17.680 --> 33:18.966
Still no sign of Karakurt.

33:19.160 --> 33:22.243
Agent Navabi's on the line now
with one of Hawkins' aides.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.408
Listen to me, it's not a potential threat.

33:24.640 --> 33:28.690
The Bureau has confirmed that a direct
attack on the senator is imminent.

33:29.160 --> 33:31.811
No, I cannot confirm my source.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.087
Find whoever is with him
and deliver the message.

33:35.320 --> 33:38.051
It's not safe to attend the service.
You need to find him.

33:38.280 --> 33:41.966
Third to the podium. After the minister
and the family representative...

33:42.200 --> 33:43.884
We'll be sitting here forever.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.202
This is fine, Patrick. I'll walk.

33:49.680 --> 33:52.126
Senator's on the move now,
we're on our way.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.526
Welcome, sir.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.000
Thank you.

34:12.760 --> 34:16.321
Harold, your cooperation
was instrumental in Karakurt's escape.

34:16.520 --> 34:19.489
- Everything's on track, thanks to you.
- Don't thank me yet.

34:19.679 --> 34:22.570
- Why? Is there a problem?
- My people are closing in on him now.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.570
They know the bombing was the first
in a series of attacks.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.125
They know about the virus.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.170
I see.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.565
Well, thank you for letting me know.

34:34.400 --> 34:37.244
Why are you letting me know?
Don't tell me you want to help.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.444
I know you'd like nothing better
than to strangle me right now.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.889
You're right. I'm letting you know
because I want you to call it off.

34:44.080 --> 34:47.050
I can't control Reddington,
I can't misdirect my people again...

34:47.239 --> 34:49.129
...without drawing suspicion.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.971
It's only a matter of time
until they stop Karakurt.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.925
Stop him from what?
They don't even know his target.

34:57.040 --> 34:58.530
Clifford Hawkins.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.251
Call it off, Tom.

35:01.440 --> 35:05.286
If the Director really wants him dead,
he can find another way on another day.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.005
No.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.281
Today is the day.

35:08.480 --> 35:13.008
I appreciate your concern,
but everything should be fine.

35:18.760 --> 35:21.127
Strange days, don't you think?

35:21.560 --> 35:25.121
Assassins don't need knives
or guns or bombs.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.561
All you have to do
is answer a few questions...

35:27.760 --> 35:29.683
...and shake the wrong man's hand.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.403
The press corps. Get over there now.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.127
- Karakurt may be posing as a reporter.
- She's going into the service now.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.088
Senator Hawkins.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.641
Federal Agent Elizabeth Keen.
Come with us, sir.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.086
- What's going on?
- The man responsible for OREA.

36:18.320 --> 36:21.051
- Karakurt? I was briefed. Was that him?
- We'll explain.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.011
- We need to get you to a secure location.
- Thank you.

36:24.240 --> 36:28.086
Please call my wife, tell her I'm okay.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.885
Sir?

36:31.000 --> 36:32.081
Sir.

36:32.280 --> 36:35.090
We need to get him to a hospital now.
He's been infected.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.290
Sir.

36:44.520 --> 36:48.491
Bethesda says Hawkins is critical.
They've called in the hospital chaplain.

36:48.720 --> 36:51.291
- He didn't touch Karakurt?
- No, sir.

36:52.040 --> 36:54.566
- Then what the hell happened?
- Karakurt's in holding.

36:54.760 --> 36:56.762
We're gonna take a run at him
and find out.

36:56.960 --> 37:01.568
Best I could tell,
Hawkins just melted down next to Keen.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.004
Karakurt.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.804
That means "spider," right?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.525
Kara... What?

37:27.200 --> 37:28.884
Look, I don't know what that is.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.491
My name is Jonas Flemming.

37:30.720 --> 37:34.281
I'm a reporter for the European wire.
I live in Rotterdam.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.804
We're gonna try this again.
We know who you are.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.403
That's you outside the OREA. You exited
a rental truck less than a minute...

37:42.600 --> 37:44.807
...before it exploded,
destroyed the building.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.843
We have a recording of you
and Andropov.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.884
We know he engineered a drug
designed to kill the senator.

37:50.120 --> 37:52.361
- We know you're infected.
- No, no, no.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.211
My credentials were taken from me
when I arrived...

37:55.400 --> 37:57.926
...but they were vetted
by your Department of Justice.

37:58.120 --> 38:00.282
- Please, call.
- You didn't touch the senator.

38:00.480 --> 38:01.811
How was the virus delivered?

38:05.200 --> 38:08.204
You can rig your little story,
but you can't rig your blood.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.890
We're running it right now.

38:10.080 --> 38:13.084
When it comes back positive
for that virus that killed Hawkins...

38:14.280 --> 38:15.327
...we got you.

38:23.520 --> 38:26.364
Hello, Anton. Relax.

38:26.560 --> 38:30.485
If I had bad intentions for this visit,
you'd know by now.

38:30.680 --> 38:33.331
- You're Raymond Reddington.
- I am.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.524
And if I'm right,
you're the same Anton Velov...

38:36.720 --> 38:40.167
...who once led
a Spetsnaz special forces unit...

38:40.360 --> 38:41.930
...called the Zarubin group.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.327
I'm surprised we never met.

38:44.520 --> 38:49.970
For many years, while you were still
with U.S. Counterintelligence...

38:50.160 --> 38:54.210
...I considered you
the KGB's greatest enemy.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.607
Oh, my God.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.640
That feels like ages ago.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.206
For what it's worth, I was young.

39:03.440 --> 39:08.765
I had no concept
of what a real enemy looked like.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.046
But I do now.

39:12.120 --> 39:16.887
Which is why I'm hoping you and I
might prove to be fast friends.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.446
What can I do?

39:19.360 --> 39:22.204
I know you're working with the CIA
as an informant...

39:22.400 --> 39:25.165
...for the Office of Russian
and European Analysis.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.886
Since those agents
are tragically no longer with us...

39:28.080 --> 39:31.607
...I was thinking perhaps
you might become an asset for me.

39:31.840 --> 39:35.322
Your American government,
they may not be done with me yet.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.767
I got a phone call from FBI.

39:38.160 --> 39:41.289
An agent named Elizabeth Keen.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.887
Really? What about?

39:44.080 --> 39:45.445
She wants to meet.

39:45.640 --> 39:49.611
She was asking
about Katarina Rostova.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.564
Did you know Katarina Rostova?

39:51.760 --> 39:53.649
No, not personally.

39:53.840 --> 39:58.323
All I know are the same old ghost stories
we all share.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.602
Well, if you were in my employ...

40:00.800 --> 40:04.441
...I would have to insist
you not speak to anyone from the FBI...

40:04.640 --> 40:07.405
...or any other
U.S. intelligence agency.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.409
Of course.

40:09.880 --> 40:13.407
And Agent Keen, she wasn't the first.

40:13.640 --> 40:17.087
Sometime back,
two men from Justice Department...

40:17.280 --> 40:19.647
...come and ask me about Katarina.

40:19.840 --> 40:22.491
I suppose they think
I am one of the few people left...

40:22.680 --> 40:25.763
...who still remember the old stories.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.003
What sort of stories?

40:29.200 --> 40:33.250
They were asking
about her KGB contacts...

40:33.440 --> 40:36.967
...where she lived, and about a child.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.211
They asked about a child?

40:41.400 --> 40:43.562
Yes, many times.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.161
"Tell me about her child."

40:46.360 --> 40:49.967
I said, "All I know
is they say she had a daughter."

40:50.160 --> 40:51.650
Dembe, the phone.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.884
How many times are we gonna go
through this? That isn't me.

40:55.080 --> 40:58.050
Call my office.
Check my visa, check my identity.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.971
You work for the Cabal.
We know what they're capable of.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.811
Was this the plan,
to protect you with this identity?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.082
The Cabal has people
all over the world.

41:06.280 --> 41:09.011
It wouldn't be hard for them
to create a Jonas Flemming...

41:09.200 --> 41:10.725
...give him a history.

41:16.440 --> 41:17.646
The crime lab just called.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.411
They're saying his blood tested negative
for the virus.

41:20.600 --> 41:23.365
Negative? That's not possible.

41:28.040 --> 41:31.123
- I got to call you right back.
- You need to get out of there.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.845
Where are you? What's going on?

41:33.040 --> 41:35.691
You've been set up.
The Cabal's been asking about you.

41:35.880 --> 41:38.326
They know who your mother was.
You've been set up.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.568
You were there when the building
was bombed.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.603
They wanted you
to save Clifford Hawkins.

41:42.800 --> 41:46.327
They sent Karakurt to the memorial
to make you think he was the threat...

41:46.560 --> 41:49.404
...so you would secure the senator,
infect him in the process.

41:49.600 --> 41:52.126
- I don't have the virus.
- You do, Lizzy.

41:52.360 --> 41:54.249
I don't need a test to know that you do.

41:54.440 --> 41:58.001
Your mother was a Russian spy, now
they've made it look like you are too.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.366
You have the virus.

41:59.560 --> 42:02.723
You infected the senator,
and now they will come for you.

42:02.920 --> 42:05.969
You need to get out of there now.
