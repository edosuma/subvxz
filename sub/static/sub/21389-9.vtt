00:00.343 --> 00:02.093
Previously on "Midnight, Texas"...

00:02.130 --> 00:03.851
It's not as charming as your old bus.

00:03.882 --> 00:05.589
You were snooping around our bus?

00:05.605 --> 00:07.007
I don't know who I am.

00:07.031 --> 00:10.210
That's something that I need
to be alone to figure out.

00:10.250 --> 00:12.471
- I love you.
- Okay.

00:12.506 --> 00:15.074
So there's a demon who's
got a thing for death

00:15.108 --> 00:18.077
and a veil to hell,
making evil run amok.

00:18.111 --> 00:20.780
Biting is not on the menu!

00:20.814 --> 00:22.648
Once you turn, you'll like it!

00:24.017 --> 00:26.786
- Olivia, I'm so...
- Back off!

00:26.820 --> 00:28.988
There's a demon in my house.

00:29.022 --> 00:32.525
Fiji, when he rises,
and you will be his.

00:32.558 --> 00:34.527
- Who are you talking about?
- Colconnar.

00:34.561 --> 00:36.929
- That's his name?
- Fiji...

00:36.963 --> 00:37.997
What is it?

00:38.031 --> 00:39.098
I hear him.

00:45.205 --> 00:47.173
Fiji...

00:50.210 --> 00:52.111
Fiji...

01:06.026 --> 01:08.527
Do I know you?

01:08.562 --> 01:10.529
You do.

01:10.564 --> 01:13.032
Colconnar sent me.

01:13.066 --> 01:14.967
He said the demon was gonna rise.

01:15.001 --> 01:17.169
That by offering a
truckload of dead bodies,

01:17.204 --> 01:21.173
it would usher in the
beginning of the end.

01:21.208 --> 01:24.143
I know, and I'm not surprised.

01:24.177 --> 01:26.812
The death and violence
that's come to Midnight...

01:26.847 --> 01:28.814
all precursors of the veil breaking.

01:28.849 --> 01:30.149
What was it like last time?

01:30.183 --> 01:32.685
I wasn't here when it first opened.

01:32.719 --> 01:34.854
Bowie and I came later.

01:34.888 --> 01:36.722
By then, it was a war zone.

01:36.756 --> 01:39.225
Demons were everywhere,
spreading death and suffering.

01:39.259 --> 01:40.659
Sounds like the apocalypse.

01:40.694 --> 01:42.495
Well, yeah. It is.

01:42.529 --> 01:44.997
Starts with your typical
apocalyptic weather events,

01:45.031 --> 01:47.527
this world reacting to the veil fraying.

01:47.554 --> 01:50.456
What do you know about
this demon? Colconnar?

01:50.491 --> 01:53.092
I wasn't on a first name
basis with the demons.

01:53.127 --> 01:54.993
I was just trying to kill as
many as I could get my hands...

01:54.995 --> 01:57.096
I won't go with him!
I'll never go with him!

01:57.131 --> 01:59.298
Leave me alone!

01:59.333 --> 02:00.884
I won't go with him!

02:00.892 --> 02:02.718
- I'll never go with him!
- Who's she talking to?

02:02.720 --> 02:05.338
You will submit.

02:05.372 --> 02:07.774
You will go to Colconnar willingly.

02:07.808 --> 02:09.175
No, I won't! I'd never!

02:09.209 --> 02:10.285
- Fiji, you okay?
- Leave me alone.

02:10.287 --> 02:12.310
I won't go with him.
I'll never go with him.

02:12.312 --> 02:13.651
Fiji, wake... wake up.

02:13.687 --> 02:15.888
You've been lying this whole time.

02:15.915 --> 02:18.650
I know the truth about you, Fiji.

02:18.690 --> 02:21.487
You bring death to those you love.

02:21.522 --> 02:23.823
Don't say that! That's
not true! I don't!

02:23.857 --> 02:25.266
You know it's true!

02:25.305 --> 02:26.993
You bring death to those you love!

02:27.027 --> 02:28.161
Stop saying that!

02:28.195 --> 02:29.162
Fiji!

02:30.264 --> 02:31.531
Fiji!

02:34.401 --> 02:36.202
Fiji? Fiji? You all right?

02:36.236 --> 02:40.406
Were you sleepwalking?

02:40.441 --> 02:42.032
No.

02:42.060 --> 02:44.028
No, it was real.

02:44.056 --> 02:46.012
He was real.

02:55.079 --> 02:57.747
The man you saw in your dream...

02:57.782 --> 02:59.082
Colconnar sent him.

02:59.116 --> 03:00.784
Well, maybe it was just a nightmare.

03:00.818 --> 03:02.185
I wish.

03:02.219 --> 03:04.187
While you were sleepwalking,

03:04.221 --> 03:06.189
you kept yelling, "Stop saying that."

03:06.223 --> 03:09.059
Stop saying what?

03:09.093 --> 03:10.927
He said I'd give myself to Colconnar.

03:10.961 --> 03:13.196
That's not gonna happen.

03:13.230 --> 03:16.900
Why is he after you? What's he want?

03:16.934 --> 03:18.496
I don't know.

03:18.535 --> 03:21.913
But I don't want anybody
getting hurt because of me.

03:21.939 --> 03:24.040
Stop! You are the one who's hurting now.

03:24.075 --> 03:27.210
We're taking care of you.

03:27.244 --> 03:29.879
The man in your dreams,

03:29.914 --> 03:33.883
did he say anything else?

03:33.918 --> 03:35.885
No.

03:37.788 --> 03:39.789
I'm gonna go make some tea.

03:44.795 --> 03:46.396
I leeched her pain.

03:46.430 --> 03:48.900
There was a lot. It ran deep.

03:48.923 --> 03:52.068
Of course she's emotional.
She's being stalked by a demon.

03:52.103 --> 03:53.903
So emotional, she almost set us on fire.

03:53.938 --> 03:57.006
Colconnar's not the only threat to Fiji.

03:57.041 --> 03:59.776
She's a threat to herself, and others.

03:59.810 --> 04:02.078
We need to keep an eye on her.

04:02.113 --> 04:04.080
I'm not going anywhere.

04:04.115 --> 04:05.849
Sun's almost up.

04:05.883 --> 04:07.851
I'll be back tonight.

04:09.887 --> 04:14.190
So are he and Olivia better?

04:14.225 --> 04:15.945
Well, they haven't
talked since the fight.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.358
He's sleeping in the
back of the pawn shop.

04:17.361 --> 04:20.430
So no.

04:28.139 --> 04:30.373
If you want, I can call in sick.

04:30.408 --> 04:32.275
I'm fine.

04:32.309 --> 04:34.277
You barely slept at all.

04:34.311 --> 04:35.879
'Cause I'm not sleepy.

04:35.913 --> 04:38.948
And if I get sleepy, I'll take a nap.

04:38.983 --> 04:41.117
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

04:41.152 --> 04:43.987
If there's anything that
you need to talk about...

04:44.021 --> 04:46.956
No. I'm fine.

04:46.991 --> 04:50.293
Okay. See you this afternoon.

05:06.299 --> 05:09.073
_

05:09.113 --> 05:11.080
Still no Starbucks.

05:23.194 --> 05:25.361
Oh, my goodness!

05:25.396 --> 05:27.831
- Fiji!
- Aunt Mildred.

05:27.865 --> 05:29.566
It's been too long!

05:29.600 --> 05:32.101
What happened to that little
girl who used to visit?

05:32.136 --> 05:35.004
Look at you! You're a grown woman.

05:35.039 --> 05:36.606
Mwah. Remember Mr. Snuggly?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.842
He's still alive.

05:38.876 --> 05:42.612
Hey, be nice, Mr. SnuggleMcCrankyPants.

05:42.646 --> 05:45.215
I'm more of a dog person.

05:45.249 --> 05:47.083
Welcome.

05:50.154 --> 05:52.121
Yay.

05:54.058 --> 05:55.828
Make yourself at home.

05:55.851 --> 05:58.126
Don't worry, Aunt Mildred.
I won't overstay my welcome.

05:58.128 --> 06:00.029
Oh, Fiji!

06:00.064 --> 06:01.429
Please.

06:04.335 --> 06:06.302
Thanks.

06:06.337 --> 06:09.639
What is it? What is it? Go on.

06:09.673 --> 06:12.041
I want you know I, um...

06:12.076 --> 06:13.476
I'm turning over a new leaf.

06:13.511 --> 06:15.732
Just gotta figure out
what I want to do next.

06:15.748 --> 06:17.916
You know, finish college, get a job.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.415
Well, that's why you're here!

06:19.450 --> 06:22.519
So you can figure it out.

06:25.189 --> 06:28.892
Your mom said you set
fire to your hospital room.

06:28.926 --> 06:32.061
Yeah, well, I was,
um, not taking my meds.

06:32.096 --> 06:34.230
I don't really remember it, so...

06:34.265 --> 06:37.567
And you broke the windows at college?

06:37.601 --> 06:39.936
I was mad.

06:39.970 --> 06:44.274
My boyfriend broke up
with me, and I lost it.

06:44.308 --> 06:46.142
My therapist calls
them "rage blackouts."

06:47.711 --> 06:49.412
I don't think that's it.

06:51.448 --> 06:53.683
I think you're like me.

06:53.717 --> 06:56.419
I don't mean a crazy cat lady.

06:56.453 --> 06:59.155
I have abilities.

06:59.189 --> 07:02.025
And I think you do too.

07:02.059 --> 07:05.028
That you can change the
physical world around you

07:05.062 --> 07:07.263
with your intentions,

07:07.298 --> 07:09.198
or your emotions.

07:14.572 --> 07:17.941
I'm a witch.

07:17.975 --> 07:19.943
And you are too.

07:25.973 --> 07:27.951
Cool.

07:31.039 --> 07:32.873
Xylda left me all my ancestors'

07:32.910 --> 07:34.357
demon-killing journals.

07:34.391 --> 07:36.025
Are they all in Romanian?

07:36.060 --> 07:37.560
I've been using an app to translate,

07:37.595 --> 07:40.463
but it's slow going.

07:40.497 --> 07:42.966
Okay, so you say that
I'm destined to fix this,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.368
that I'm... I'm the guy with the vision

07:45.402 --> 07:48.137
who can bridge the living and the dead.

07:48.172 --> 07:49.172
That's the prophecy.

07:52.543 --> 07:56.045
Who sealed the veil last time?

07:56.080 --> 07:59.649
It didn't hold forever,
obviously, but it was a shaman.

07:59.683 --> 08:01.651
Catori was his name.

08:01.685 --> 08:03.353
Weird guy.

08:03.387 --> 08:06.089
Tall. Covered in brands and tattoos.

08:06.123 --> 08:09.092
Didn't happen to tell you how he did it?

08:09.126 --> 08:12.495
He didn't survive.

08:12.529 --> 08:15.164
He went out to the crossroads alone.

08:15.199 --> 08:16.766
We found the body a day later.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.335
In pieces. Broken and burned.

08:21.372 --> 08:23.673
Where was he buried?

08:23.707 --> 08:25.675
On sanctified ground.

08:25.709 --> 08:27.677
Underneath the Rev's church.

08:29.851 --> 08:31.819
Well, let's dig him up.

08:31.858 --> 08:34.350
Dead bodies, I can work with.

08:34.385 --> 08:37.253
Ah, you better work fast.

08:37.287 --> 08:39.222
The veil's opening.

08:41.759 --> 08:44.394
Frances, here's your chicken.

08:44.428 --> 08:46.596
- Pork.
- If you'll excuse us.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.464
I will be right back.

08:48.499 --> 08:50.767
You need to evacuate the restaurant.

08:50.801 --> 08:52.535
There's a sandstorm headed this way.

08:52.569 --> 08:54.437
Well, we have a storm cellar underneath.

08:54.471 --> 08:56.272
Creek, it's the veil.

08:56.306 --> 08:59.275
Rev and Joe are warning
everyone in town to go.

08:59.309 --> 09:02.445
These people need to leave Midnight.

09:02.479 --> 09:04.614
And so do you.

09:04.648 --> 09:06.482
You're getting rid of me?

09:06.517 --> 09:09.218
You just got to town, and
we haven't had a chance

09:09.253 --> 09:10.652
- to talk, and...
- And there are demons

09:10.654 --> 09:12.321
from hell on the way.

09:12.356 --> 09:15.425
Lem, Fiji, Rev, Joe... All supernatural.

09:15.459 --> 09:18.394
Olivia, Bobo... they can
be just as dangerous, but...

09:20.330 --> 09:23.266
I just...

09:23.300 --> 09:25.435
I don't want you to get hurt.

09:25.469 --> 09:27.236
Well, I don't want
you to get hurt either.

09:27.271 --> 09:30.239
There's no way I'm letting that happen.

09:30.274 --> 09:33.309
You and I, we've got
unfinished business.

09:37.781 --> 09:39.348
Okay.

09:39.383 --> 09:41.250
You fix this, and you call me.

09:41.285 --> 09:42.318
I will.

09:56.567 --> 09:58.195
Where's Creek? Still with Fiji?

09:58.226 --> 10:00.436
No. I told her to evacuate.

10:00.471 --> 10:02.438
She's strong. Survived more than most.

10:02.473 --> 10:04.607
She doesn't need to survive this.

10:04.641 --> 10:08.111
You're complicating it.
You love her. Be with her.

10:12.416 --> 10:14.150
Thanks for the advice.

11:25.776 --> 11:28.278
Manfred better get answers

11:28.312 --> 11:30.780
from whatever dead guy he's digging up.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.283
And you should have
called me last night!

11:33.317 --> 11:35.285
Lem was here. I didn't
know if you two...

11:35.319 --> 11:37.187
I can be in the same room as Lem.

11:37.221 --> 11:40.290
Just not giving him the keys.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.292
He hurt me.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.628
Look at me.

11:44.662 --> 11:47.464
I'm covered in silver.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.300
I don't know...

11:50.334 --> 11:51.935
I hope you two work it out.

11:51.969 --> 11:53.803
You and Lem make sense.

12:05.483 --> 12:07.317
How are you doing?

12:07.351 --> 12:10.820
I'm fine.

12:10.855 --> 12:14.157
And I don't need you both here.

12:14.191 --> 12:17.360
- Livi and I aren't leaving.
- Well, maybe...

12:17.395 --> 12:19.696
Maybe I don't want you here.

12:19.730 --> 12:21.331
You ever consider that?

12:21.365 --> 12:24.334
Maybe when you told me that you love me

12:24.368 --> 12:26.903
and I didn't say it back,

12:26.938 --> 12:30.807
maybe it was a hint.

12:30.841 --> 12:32.509
I see what you're doing.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.843
It's not gonna work.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.513
As long as you're in danger,

12:36.547 --> 12:37.995
we're not going anywhere.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.406
Oh, no!

13:03.441 --> 13:05.977
That... you're not
ready. That's dark magic.

13:06.009 --> 13:08.878
Only to be done when you
know what you're doing.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.880
Young lady, do not.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.884
At least, not yet.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.756
Bulbs are dormant in the winter.

13:19.790 --> 13:21.958
That's natural.

13:21.993 --> 13:23.526
But...

13:24.895 --> 13:26.863
When you're a witch...

13:28.899 --> 13:30.867
You can change the natural.

13:35.439 --> 13:36.873
Wow.

13:36.907 --> 13:39.242
How'd you do that?

13:39.275 --> 13:41.176
Powers come from our emotions.

13:41.210 --> 13:44.545
Make your feelings intentions.

13:44.582 --> 13:46.129
Oh, like breaking windows?

13:46.160 --> 13:50.754
Let's try to be productive
instead of destructive.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.243
Give this tulip a little nudge.

13:56.694 --> 13:59.562
Think spring.

13:59.597 --> 14:00.962
And rebirth.

14:06.037 --> 14:08.571
Spring.

14:08.606 --> 14:10.040
Um...

14:11.609 --> 14:13.576
Flowers.

14:13.611 --> 14:15.845
Trees.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.013
Easter!

14:17.048 --> 14:19.816
Uh, hay fever. Mowed lawns.

14:19.850 --> 14:22.819
No, not just words.

14:22.853 --> 14:24.821
Feel something.

14:34.865 --> 14:36.833
Okay.

14:42.873 --> 14:44.874
Sun's out.

14:44.909 --> 14:47.944
All warm against my skin...

14:50.081 --> 14:54.317
The air is sweet with

14:54.343 --> 14:56.211
night-blooming jasmine and...

14:56.239 --> 14:57.487
Fiji...

14:57.521 --> 15:00.690
- The cool breeze...
- Fiji, stop!

15:03.661 --> 15:05.628
Did I do something wrong?

15:05.663 --> 15:08.731
No. No, but be careful.

15:08.766 --> 15:10.967
Your emotions...

15:11.001 --> 15:12.836
You need to control them.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.088
Bobo, Olivia, come here.

15:32.123 --> 15:33.646
- You okay?
- He's out there!

15:33.669 --> 15:35.326
The man from last
night, he's right there.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.993
What is it?

15:37.027 --> 15:39.482
No, I... I swear it,
he was right out there.

15:39.513 --> 15:40.663
Let's go find him.

15:40.698 --> 15:42.365
Okay, stay here.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.667
Lock the door.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.673
There he is!

15:59.049 --> 16:01.384
I thought you said he was tall.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.053
There wasn't much left of him to bury.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.896
No...

16:12.930 --> 16:14.597
There has to be something left.

16:14.632 --> 16:16.466
Bones, clothes, anything.

16:20.004 --> 16:21.538
I'm afraid not.

16:21.572 --> 16:23.206
It's been a thousand years.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.974
It was a long shot.

16:25.009 --> 16:26.809
That was our only shot.

16:28.179 --> 16:29.212
What was that?

16:44.495 --> 16:46.162
What the hell are those things?

16:46.197 --> 16:47.452
Wraiths.

16:47.475 --> 16:50.433
Evil spirits heralding
the arrival of a demon.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.968
Colconnar's coming.

16:52.002 --> 16:53.903
Great. So now what do we do?

16:59.435 --> 17:00.734
I've been shot twice.

17:00.748 --> 17:02.651
Stabbed.

17:02.686 --> 17:04.653
Nothing's burned like that.

17:07.691 --> 17:09.657
That feels nice.

17:11.228 --> 17:14.195
It's my own salve.
Worked on it for years.

17:17.032 --> 17:19.101
You could have died protecting me.

17:21.371 --> 17:23.204
I'm sorry.

17:26.742 --> 17:30.713
There's nowhere I'd rather be.

17:30.747 --> 17:32.248
At least they're spirits.

17:32.282 --> 17:33.749
They can't come into this house.

17:33.783 --> 17:36.051
And Colconnar? What about him?

17:36.086 --> 17:38.921
He's not spirit. He's alive.

17:38.955 --> 17:42.124
- Once he rises...
- We're screwed.

17:42.159 --> 17:44.360
She's right.

17:44.394 --> 17:47.363
We've got no way to stop
them. No way to stop Colconnar.

17:47.397 --> 17:48.750
We're sitting ducks.

17:48.781 --> 17:51.100
Quite the motivational
speaker, aren't you?

17:51.134 --> 17:52.635
No, I'm... I'm a realist,

17:52.669 --> 17:54.036
and my realistic self knows

17:54.070 --> 17:56.238
there's only one thing we can do.

17:56.273 --> 17:58.374
- Get out.
- So you bail just to come back

17:58.408 --> 18:00.408
- and tell us all to bail?
- I'm not saying we bail.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.077
I'm saying we get Fiji somewhere safe,

18:02.112 --> 18:04.780
we regroup, rethink,
come back with a plan

18:04.814 --> 18:06.782
to kill the wraiths and Colconnar.

18:08.318 --> 18:10.286
Joe and I are gonna go to the garage.

18:11.855 --> 18:13.255
Careful.

18:16.193 --> 18:20.162
Well, before we leave,

18:20.197 --> 18:24.233
I need you to wake up a vampire.

18:47.324 --> 18:50.359
Mr. Snuggly, come on!

18:50.393 --> 18:52.928
Snuggly, where are you?

18:52.963 --> 18:54.930
We'll find him.

18:54.965 --> 18:57.933
- He hides during storms.
- I'll look out back.

19:04.975 --> 19:06.942
Scat!

19:14.417 --> 19:16.151
Don't like cats?

19:16.186 --> 19:17.653
He didn't like me first.

19:19.356 --> 19:21.156
It's pretty cool what you did here.

19:21.191 --> 19:23.325
What'd I do?

19:26.363 --> 19:29.898
I know about Mildred being a witch,

19:29.933 --> 19:31.800
- so I just assumed...
- Well, don't.

19:31.835 --> 19:33.969
You don't know me or
anything about me, so...

19:34.004 --> 19:35.404
Wait. Whoa, I...

19:35.438 --> 19:37.406
I didn't mean anything by it.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.208
I'm a Midnighter. We're good with weird.

19:39.242 --> 19:42.978
So if you're a witch, that's cool.

19:43.013 --> 19:45.014
Cool?

19:47.504 --> 19:50.819
I'm Jeremy. You got a name?

19:50.854 --> 19:53.355
- It's Fiji.
- Like the island?

19:53.390 --> 19:55.605
Yeah, my parents, um...

19:55.629 --> 19:57.859
they liked to travel, but
they didn't have any money,

19:57.861 --> 20:01.830
so they named us after
places they wanted to go.

20:01.865 --> 20:04.266
I like it.

20:04.301 --> 20:06.035
Yeah.

20:06.069 --> 20:09.038
You do like weird.

20:14.244 --> 20:15.711
You two good?

20:15.745 --> 20:17.846
No. I'm up in daylight.

20:17.881 --> 20:20.716
- Walking into the sun.
- Ugh! Quit complaining.

20:20.750 --> 20:24.219
- And move!
- You enjoying this? Payback?

20:24.254 --> 20:26.708
Ha! If this was payback, you'd be naked.

20:26.738 --> 20:28.143
And we wouldn't have arranged

20:28.166 --> 20:29.533
for the vampire bus.

20:29.559 --> 20:32.461
No sunlight. You're welcome.

20:32.495 --> 20:35.197
No, no, no. I can't, I
can't, I can't leave...

20:35.231 --> 20:37.266
Are you crazy? We gotta
get you out of here!

20:37.300 --> 20:39.101
- I can't leave him!
- Give me your car keys.

20:39.135 --> 20:40.705
- I'll get him.
- Okay.

20:40.728 --> 20:43.096
- The cat carrier's by the door!
- Yeah, you-you go.

20:43.139 --> 20:45.107
I'll catch up.

20:46.752 --> 20:49.111
Mr. Snuggly!

20:56.353 --> 20:58.220
I don't want to hear it.

21:18.141 --> 21:20.075
- What are you doing here?
- Later! Get in!

21:30.833 --> 21:33.350
A state of emergency has been
issued for Roca Fria County.

21:33.352 --> 21:36.053
Dust storms have been reported
throughout the county.

21:36.088 --> 21:37.888
If you're in your car and get caught,

21:37.923 --> 21:39.357
pull aside to stay alive.

21:39.391 --> 21:41.058
That's not an option.

21:41.093 --> 21:43.594
I really wish you
hadn't come back for me.

21:43.629 --> 21:45.096
You stayed to save the cat.

21:45.130 --> 21:49.033
No. No. I stayed to
make sure Fiji would go.

21:49.067 --> 21:50.901
Okay, well, if I hadn't showed up,

21:50.936 --> 21:52.737
you and Mr. Snuggly would be dead.

21:52.771 --> 21:54.238
Maybe.

21:54.272 --> 21:57.174
- Probably. Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:59.778 --> 22:02.279
What happened? The
cut on your forehead...

22:02.314 --> 22:04.181
I crashed the car.

22:04.216 --> 22:05.583
It wouldn't start, but just...

22:05.606 --> 22:07.317
The fuel pump inertia
switch got tripped,

22:07.319 --> 22:08.567
but as I was driving off,

22:08.585 --> 22:10.419
I started to worry about you guys.

22:10.435 --> 22:13.090
I saw that the storm was moving in.

22:13.125 --> 22:16.594
I thought, you know, what
if you guys had car trouble.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.262
Sure. That's why.

22:22.572 --> 22:25.102
I was worried about everyone.

22:25.137 --> 22:28.105
And you in particular.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.608
Dear God, get a room.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.610
- Wait. What?
- Who said that?

22:40.419 --> 22:42.386
Olivia talked to Manfred.

22:42.421 --> 22:44.255
They made it out alive with Snuggly.

22:44.289 --> 22:47.058
We're all safe.

22:47.092 --> 22:49.393
I hope so.

22:49.428 --> 22:51.262
Is there something else?

22:51.296 --> 22:53.044
Something you're not telling me?

22:58.871 --> 23:00.065
No.

23:08.447 --> 23:10.602
In the hospital,

23:10.633 --> 23:13.984
they would bring by these
little plastic cups of pills.

23:14.019 --> 23:15.453
Okay. That sounds fun, actually.

23:15.487 --> 23:17.154
No, not at all.

23:17.189 --> 23:18.989
You know, I would swallow,

23:19.024 --> 23:20.791
and I'd have to endure this mouth check

23:20.826 --> 23:22.359
by a very angry nurse,

23:22.394 --> 23:23.993
and then as soon as
they'd leave the room,

23:23.995 --> 23:25.521
I would spit them out.

23:25.550 --> 23:27.083
So I got really good at keeping them

23:27.107 --> 23:29.443
- between my gums and my cheek.
- That's a skill.

23:29.465 --> 23:30.866
Yeah, well...

23:30.896 --> 23:33.938
But then, they changed my meds.

23:33.972 --> 23:36.107
And one of them was a horse pill,

23:36.141 --> 23:37.975
and I got busted.

23:38.009 --> 23:40.311
Spent the next month in solitary.

23:42.347 --> 23:45.182
Yup, yup. Until, uh...

23:45.217 --> 23:48.319
I lit my padded room on fire.

23:51.056 --> 23:53.023
You could have hurt yourself.

23:53.058 --> 23:56.026
I didn't even know how I did it.

23:56.061 --> 24:00.030
Just was angry, and...

24:00.065 --> 24:02.032
And then,

24:02.067 --> 24:04.368
poof.

24:04.402 --> 24:05.903
Hey.

24:15.046 --> 24:18.149
And they told me that
I blacked out doing it.

24:18.183 --> 24:20.151
I was terrified.

24:23.188 --> 24:26.157
But now,

24:26.191 --> 24:30.327
I know I'm not crazy.

24:30.362 --> 24:32.496
Just magic.

24:54.553 --> 24:56.287
I don't see what the big deal is.

24:56.321 --> 24:58.289
The big deal is,

24:58.323 --> 25:00.524
you are too powerful.

25:00.559 --> 25:02.526
You need to guard your emotions.

25:02.561 --> 25:04.528
I don't know him well.

25:04.563 --> 25:06.530
You don't know him at all.

25:06.565 --> 25:08.933
Please.

25:08.967 --> 25:11.302
Protect your heart.

25:19.578 --> 25:22.112
- Got clear roads ahead.
- Great.

25:22.147 --> 25:24.281
I booked a row of rooms
at a Knights Inn in Waco.

25:24.316 --> 25:26.550
That's a couple of hours away.

25:26.585 --> 25:28.319
Guys...

25:28.353 --> 25:29.320
Behind us.

25:30.488 --> 25:32.489
Olivia!

25:32.524 --> 25:34.558
It's following us?

25:34.593 --> 25:36.227
- Creek.
- Yeah?

25:36.261 --> 25:37.294
No pressure,

25:37.329 --> 25:39.230
but faster.

25:39.264 --> 25:40.464
Okay.

25:40.498 --> 25:41.751
We gotta get some distance.

25:41.782 --> 25:43.801
Well, we can't outrun it in a tour bus.

25:46.171 --> 25:47.937
We need to hole up
somewhere without windows,

25:47.959 --> 25:50.975
- somewhere nearby.
- Where?

25:51.009 --> 25:53.143
Take that road. I
know the perfect place.

26:28.647 --> 26:30.614
Fiji!

26:30.649 --> 26:32.616
Fiji!

26:39.891 --> 26:41.959
So much for outrunning the storm.

26:41.993 --> 26:44.962
- It's following us.
- No.

26:44.996 --> 26:46.964
It's me. It's...

26:46.998 --> 26:49.166
- It's following me.
- Fij...

26:49.200 --> 26:50.938
There's something you're not saying.

26:50.969 --> 26:53.170
If you know why the
storm is chasing you,

26:53.204 --> 26:54.638
it's time you tell us.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.584
I don't know why Colconnar's after me.

27:02.619 --> 27:04.653
You and I were there,

27:04.687 --> 27:06.444
that first time Colconnar showed.

27:06.475 --> 27:07.924
He threw me out. Went after you.

27:07.951 --> 27:09.591
- Grabbed you.
- Get out of my way.

27:09.615 --> 27:11.077
He's been talking to you ever since.

27:11.084 --> 27:12.287
Has he told you something?

27:12.322 --> 27:13.983
Why he's after you and no one else?

27:13.998 --> 27:16.498
I said I don't know!

27:16.532 --> 27:18.001
Fij!

27:18.034 --> 27:20.080
What is going on?

27:23.539 --> 27:27.075
We're all here to protect you.

27:27.110 --> 27:28.744
You owe us the truth. What's...

27:28.778 --> 27:30.545
I'm a virgin!

27:33.082 --> 27:35.684
I'm a virgin witch, a
powerful virgin witch,

27:35.718 --> 27:38.787
and that is why it wants me.

27:44.994 --> 27:47.146
Well, um...

27:47.185 --> 27:50.032
thanks for being honest. I, uh...

27:50.058 --> 27:52.169
Yeah. Glad to know the truth.

27:52.193 --> 27:54.803
I'm not.

27:54.837 --> 27:56.805
What difference does it make?

27:56.839 --> 27:59.374
Virgin witches,

27:59.409 --> 28:01.823
especially older ones,

28:01.866 --> 28:03.366
we're rare.

28:03.394 --> 28:05.361
Powerful.

28:05.377 --> 28:07.916
That thing wants my magic.

28:09.986 --> 28:11.620
Well, it's not getting anywhere near...

28:11.654 --> 28:13.321
No, please don't!

28:13.356 --> 28:16.458
This is the most embarrassing
moment of my life,

28:16.492 --> 28:18.627
so if you don't mind,

28:18.661 --> 28:20.629
I'm just gonna need a minute.

28:23.666 --> 28:25.667
The cat.

28:42.018 --> 28:44.519
Eh, you left out the best part.

28:46.189 --> 28:48.226
They don't need to know.

28:51.750 --> 28:55.363
- Ooh!
- Happy three-month-iversary.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.367
Oh, thank you.

29:02.071 --> 29:04.039
Mmm!

29:04.073 --> 29:06.041
- Sweet.
- Yeah?

29:13.649 --> 29:16.618
I love you.

29:16.652 --> 29:19.621
- Did you just say...
- I love you.

29:19.655 --> 29:22.180
Yeah.

29:22.211 --> 29:25.594
I love you back.

29:44.580 --> 29:46.548
You know I never, um...

29:48.618 --> 29:50.752
You know.

29:50.787 --> 29:53.922
Do you want to?

29:56.959 --> 29:58.994
Yeah.

30:22.285 --> 30:24.119
I-I...

30:24.153 --> 30:25.787
Are you okay?

30:25.822 --> 30:27.556
You're so warm.

30:27.590 --> 30:29.724
Jeremy?

30:31.260 --> 30:33.261
Oh! Jeremy!

30:37.800 --> 30:39.459
Jeremy!

30:39.490 --> 30:41.458
Jeremy! Jeremy!

30:41.475 --> 30:43.142
Feelings. Feelings become intentions.

30:43.154 --> 30:44.886
Feelings become intentions.

30:44.920 --> 30:48.556
Stop the fire! Stop it!
Stop the heat! Stop it!

30:53.562 --> 30:55.824
Jeremy, you're not hot anymore.

30:59.335 --> 31:02.537
You're gonna be okay.

31:02.571 --> 31:06.407
You're gonna be okay. Uh, um...

31:06.442 --> 31:09.243
Think, uh, rebirth.

31:09.278 --> 31:11.746
Think, um, the sun...

31:11.780 --> 31:13.648
The sun is out.

31:13.682 --> 31:16.684
The flowers bloom, um,
living things are reborn.

31:16.719 --> 31:18.820
- Uh, living...
- Fiji.

31:18.854 --> 31:20.755
- Fiji, what happened?
- Living things are re...

31:20.789 --> 31:22.590
Reborn.

31:30.799 --> 31:32.900
Oh! Oh, God!

31:32.935 --> 31:34.836
What did I do?

31:34.870 --> 31:38.439
What did I do?

31:42.945 --> 31:44.779
That explains the sweaters.

31:47.616 --> 31:51.786
I'm surprised that you came for me.

31:51.820 --> 31:53.788
Well...

31:53.822 --> 31:57.792
Despite what happened,

31:57.826 --> 32:01.295
I love you.

32:01.330 --> 32:03.865
Lem, you asked me to
give you a heads-up.

32:03.899 --> 32:05.400
I'm giving you one.

32:05.434 --> 32:07.702
As soon as Fiji's safe...

32:11.106 --> 32:13.708
I'm leaving Midnight.

32:15.644 --> 32:16.944
Because of me.

32:16.979 --> 32:19.653
Because of a lot of reasons.

32:21.850 --> 32:24.318
I don't feel safe.

32:24.353 --> 32:26.320
I never stay in one place too long.

32:26.355 --> 32:29.824
I don't want Dad to
track me down, and...

32:29.858 --> 32:32.727
And I've stayed in Midnight

32:32.761 --> 32:35.697
a lot longer than I ever expected.

32:37.700 --> 32:39.600
That's because of you.

32:48.010 --> 32:50.078
Then...

32:52.014 --> 32:54.982
I consider myself fortunate.

32:57.186 --> 33:00.088
I've never known
anyone like you, Olivia.

33:01.857 --> 33:03.658
And so...

33:04.860 --> 33:08.029
Thank you for letting me

33:08.063 --> 33:11.365
spend the last few years with you.

33:15.070 --> 33:17.605
Same.

33:24.079 --> 33:26.375
Do you... Do you want me to leech,

33:26.414 --> 33:28.015
for old time's sake?

33:32.154 --> 33:35.123
I'm gonna have to get used
to dealing without you.

33:42.931 --> 33:47.668
No pressure, but do you have
any idea how to fix this?

33:47.703 --> 33:50.671
Not a one.

33:50.706 --> 33:53.007
I can't fix this.

33:53.041 --> 33:56.210
Well, I'm gonna choose
to believe you can.

33:56.245 --> 33:58.079
Don't lose faith.

33:58.113 --> 34:00.214
It's not faith, it's fact.

34:00.249 --> 34:03.016
Fiji is a lot more
powerful than I am, and...

34:07.523 --> 34:09.190
And...

34:11.226 --> 34:14.061
And leading sometimes means
knowing when to delegate.

34:23.272 --> 34:25.940
These are some curses my ancestors used.

34:25.974 --> 34:28.775
To punish the wicked.
To vanquish demons.

34:28.811 --> 34:32.914
Here, I, uh, translated what I could.

34:34.583 --> 34:37.083
This is very dark magic.

34:37.119 --> 34:39.954
Meaning dangerous as hell?

34:39.987 --> 34:42.023
Then again, so is Colconnar.

34:47.496 --> 34:50.797
Gypsy dark magic...

34:50.833 --> 34:52.967
meet witchcraft dark magic.

35:04.088 --> 35:05.388
We were getting worried.

35:05.407 --> 35:07.141
Might still want to be worried.

35:07.167 --> 35:09.968
We combined a curse

35:09.995 --> 35:12.196
with an ancient witches'
spell to get answers.

35:12.221 --> 35:14.655
Problem is, it's, um...

35:14.690 --> 35:16.991
it's black magic.

35:17.025 --> 35:20.294
Meaning, it needs a sacrifice.

35:20.336 --> 35:22.670
Okay. An eye?

35:22.698 --> 35:25.166
- Finger?
- A life.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.802
Answers given in exchange for a life.

35:27.836 --> 35:29.804
So that's a no.

35:32.174 --> 35:34.642
- Take me.
- Don't be ridiculous, Emilio.

35:34.676 --> 35:36.978
I'm not. I've taken many lives.

35:37.012 --> 35:38.846
- We all have.
- But saving Midnight

35:38.881 --> 35:40.121
can be my way of making amends.

35:40.148 --> 35:42.650
Everybody, just shut up.

35:45.020 --> 35:46.654
Take me.

35:46.688 --> 35:48.145
I'm sick of this life.

35:48.184 --> 35:50.591
- Is that cat talking?
- He is.

35:50.626 --> 35:52.860
I'm really old. My bones ache.

35:52.895 --> 35:55.863
I've spent the last
seven years without her.

35:55.898 --> 35:58.199
I want to see Mildred.

35:58.233 --> 35:59.967
You've been by my side for so long...

36:00.002 --> 36:01.969
But I never liked you.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.607
I know.

36:42.277 --> 36:44.345
Give Aunt Mildred a kiss for me.

36:53.088 --> 36:55.990
We offer this life for an answer.

37:13.942 --> 37:16.210
Hey, why am I not dead?

37:17.446 --> 37:19.280
Manfred?

37:21.817 --> 37:22.783
Manfred!

37:26.595 --> 37:28.795
- Manfred!
- Move!

37:29.830 --> 37:32.698
No, no. No-no-no-no-no.

37:32.732 --> 37:35.015
- This isn't happening.
- No, no, no, no.

37:35.038 --> 37:37.937
He was just supposed
to get an... answers.

37:37.971 --> 37:40.940
He can't be dead.

37:40.974 --> 37:43.943
No. No, no. Oh, my God.

37:43.977 --> 37:45.611
- He's gone.
- Oh, my God. No.

37:45.645 --> 37:46.878
He can't be dead. Please.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.849
No. Don't be dead.

37:56.590 --> 37:58.557
He's like ice.

38:02.095 --> 38:05.464
I'm just going to stay here...

38:08.001 --> 38:10.803
Because I don't believe you're gone.

38:10.837 --> 38:12.638
This is magic.

38:20.539 --> 38:22.173
And you said to say when I was ready

38:22.183 --> 38:24.683
to pick up where we left off.

38:27.888 --> 38:30.990
I'm ready.

38:31.024 --> 38:34.493
Come back to me.

38:51.585 --> 38:55.021
You're the shaman. Cato...

38:55.048 --> 38:59.518
Catori. And you are?

38:59.553 --> 39:02.222
Manfred.

39:02.251 --> 39:04.385
So this is...

39:04.435 --> 39:05.702
this is death?

39:07.108 --> 39:09.576
This is death.

39:11.679 --> 39:14.347
I like it here.

39:14.382 --> 39:17.517
It's peaceful.

39:17.551 --> 39:20.854
A lot more peaceful than
Midnight is at the moment.

39:20.888 --> 39:23.256
Is Xylda around?

39:23.291 --> 39:26.326
Don't you have a question for me?

39:26.360 --> 39:29.496
Yeah. Sorry.

39:29.530 --> 39:31.285
How do I close the veil?

40:11.272 --> 40:14.808
How'd you know what you said? How?

40:26.854 --> 40:28.590
Jeremy?

40:30.395 --> 40:34.694
Colconnar sent me because
he knew you'd listen to me.

40:34.729 --> 40:38.832
- I never meant to hurt you.
- But you did.

40:38.866 --> 40:40.720
Come with me, and you will never

40:40.751 --> 40:44.237
hurt anyone else you care about.

40:44.271 --> 40:46.673
Neither will Colconnar.

40:46.707 --> 40:49.242
Go to him willingly,

40:49.276 --> 40:52.579
and he'll spare the others.

40:52.613 --> 40:54.914
But if you don't,

40:54.949 --> 40:57.617
they all die.

41:19.507 --> 41:21.608
You can't just die, Manfred.

41:21.642 --> 41:22.809
That's not cool of you...

41:25.312 --> 41:27.280
Hey!

41:27.314 --> 41:30.784
- Your heart was stopped.
- What the hell?

41:30.818 --> 41:34.788
Fiji's spell. It worked.

41:34.822 --> 41:38.324
You got answers?

41:38.359 --> 41:40.293
Yeah.

41:40.327 --> 41:42.228
I met the shaman.

41:42.263 --> 41:44.230
Where's Fiji?

41:49.141 --> 41:50.637
Fiji!

41:53.541 --> 41:55.508
She's going to him.
