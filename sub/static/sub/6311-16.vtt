Hi.

00:03.699 --> 00:05.048
Hey.

00:05.135 --> 00:06.267
BOTH:
Bad news.

00:08.095 --> 00:10.358
BOTH:
Not again!

00:10.445 --> 00:11.446
You go first.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.230
Remember the temporary crown

00:13.317 --> 00:14.710
I got at that dental clinic
in Tijuana a few years ago?

00:14.797 --> 00:16.103
Yeah.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.018
I swallowed it.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.847
Total waste of 800 pesos.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.197
So you need
to go to the dentist.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.633
Yeah,

00:24.720 --> 00:26.548
and both my passports
are expired.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.029
What'’s your bad news?

00:29.116 --> 00:30.856
I got laid off.What?

00:30.943 --> 00:33.903
The restaurant'’s closing
for six weeks for renovations.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.731
And they'’re not paying you
during the down time?

00:35.818 --> 00:36.819
They'’re only carrying
the employees

00:36.906 --> 00:38.038
they can'’t afford to lose.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.214
Oh, well, then you'’re out.

00:40.301 --> 00:43.565
I'’d like to argue
with you, but yeah.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.697
So we'’re looking at
six weeks with no income.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.743
Wow. I should'’ve savored
that Mexican crown.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.746
Might be the last thing
I eat for a while.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.227
Hang on. Let'’s not panic.

00:53.314 --> 00:55.229
We just need to stay cool
and make a plan.

00:55.316 --> 00:56.404
You'’re right.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.406
We can think our
way out of this.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.085
♪

01:40.926 --> 01:41.884
I think I'’ll just
stick with coffee.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.364
How '’bout you?

01:43.451 --> 01:45.844
I'’d like a bowl
of very hot water

01:45.931 --> 01:47.194
and six ketchup packets.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.154
Come on. You guys got
to order something.

01:51.241 --> 01:52.590
Yeah, I can'’t
enjoy my meal

01:55.550 --> 01:57.813
Why are you whispering?

I'’m sorry.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.472
Not until right now.

off the menu.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.301

02:07.388 --> 02:09.085
Thanks, but we don'’t
need your charity.

02:09.172 --> 02:10.651
Chicken potpie
and a vanilla milkshake.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.349
Twice.

02:12.436 --> 02:13.959
If you'’re really up against it,

02:14.046 --> 02:16.310
Victor and I would be happy
to lend you some money.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.529
Thanks, Marjorie,
but as your friend,

02:18.616 --> 02:20.966
I have to tell you,
never lend me money.

02:21.053 --> 02:23.099
So how are you
gonna live?

02:23.186 --> 02:24.448
Well, for the time being,

02:24.535 --> 02:26.146
this one'’s job
covers the rent,

02:26.233 --> 02:27.756
but we still have
credit card bills,

02:27.843 --> 02:29.018
my student loans...

My hillbilly mouth.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.979
Hey, why don'’t you
come work for me?

02:34.066 --> 02:35.329
Seriously?

02:35.416 --> 02:36.460
Yeah, I was
actually thinking

02:36.547 --> 02:37.983
of hiring
a personal assistant.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.159
To do what?

02:39.246 --> 02:40.725
Assist me.

02:40.812 --> 02:43.989
With my personal stuff.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.122
God, Jill, that'’d be great.

Hold on, ladies.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.996
Friends working for friends
isn'’t always a good idea.

02:51.083 --> 02:54.304
Why do you always do that?

02:54.391 --> 02:55.305
Do what?

02:55.392 --> 02:56.741
Something good is happening here

Jill, thank you.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.359
You'’re saving my life.

03:05.446 --> 03:06.577
When do I start?

03:06.664 --> 03:07.883
How about now?

03:07.970 --> 03:09.058
Here'’s a quarter.

03:09.145 --> 03:10.364
Go feed my parking meter.

03:10.451 --> 03:11.930
I'’m on it, boss.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.410
Oh, could you feed mine, too?

03:13.497 --> 03:14.846
Sorry, I don'’t work for you.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.461
See you later.

03:20.548 --> 03:21.810
What time are you
gonna be back?

03:21.897 --> 03:23.464
No idea.

03:23.551 --> 03:24.943
Did Jill tell you what
you'’re gonna be doing?

03:25.030 --> 03:26.075
Nope. She just told me

03:26.162 --> 03:28.033
to bring a laptop and a bikini.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.253
Seriously? A bikini?

03:30.340 --> 03:31.994
I'’m bringing a one-piece.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.778
I thought it'’d be
a little more professional.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.476
Okay, I gotta go.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.087
I don'’t want to be late
for my first day of...

Nope. Still wrong number.

04:11.076 --> 04:14.689
Uh, 707-637-5839.

That'’s this,
but there'’s no Linda here.

04:17.082 --> 04:18.257
Oh, man.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.346
She blew me off.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.738
What'’s that?

04:20.825 --> 04:22.479
I met this girl
at a bar last night,

04:22.566 --> 04:23.959
and it looks like she
gave me a bogus number.

04:24.046 --> 04:27.179
Oh, yeah. I know that trick.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.181
I used to give
the Domino'’s number,

04:29.269 --> 04:31.140
so at least they'’d get
a pizza out of it.

04:31.227 --> 04:33.316
Hey, that'’s thoughtful.

I'’m starting to see why Linda
gave you a bogus number.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.555
Oh, no, I-I'’m sorry.
I just have to ask:

04:54.642 --> 04:57.209
Why would a woman pretend
to hit it off with a guy,

04:57.297 --> 04:59.124
and then give him
a fake number?

04:59.211 --> 05:00.822
Lots of reasons.

05:00.909 --> 05:01.910
Maybe she didn'’t want
to hurt his feelings.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.607
Maybe she'’s married.

05:03.694 --> 05:06.044
Maybe he'’s just
a garden variety uggo.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.046
Well, I know
it'’s not the last one.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.919
A lot of women consider me
rakishly handsome.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.965
Are these women your mom
and your grandma?

05:14.052 --> 05:16.446
They'’re on the list, yes.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.361
Well, you sound
like a terrific guy.

05:18.448 --> 05:19.797
I hope you meet the lady
you'’re looking for.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.408
Thanks.

to be you, would it?

Sure.

I don'’t know.

What time do you want to eat?

05:53.091 --> 05:55.224
How about after
our tennis lesson?

05:55.311 --> 05:57.531
That sounds good.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.533
We also have
to go shopping later.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.056

Um, okay.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.070
Also, do you think
you could start talking

06:15.157 --> 06:16.419
with a British accent?

06:16.506 --> 06:18.203
What?

06:18.290 --> 06:21.337
Well, I just think
a British assistant is classier.

I'’ll give it me best, guv'’nah.

06:27.865 --> 06:30.215
Never mind.

I hired an orphan.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.788

06:37.875 --> 06:39.442
How long were you a stuntman?

MAN:
Over 30 years.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.490
Would I have seen you
in anything?

06:43.577 --> 06:45.143
Uh, maybe.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.928
Ever watched a movie where
a guy gets in a car

06:47.015 --> 06:48.364
and turns the ignition
and the car explodes?

06:48.451 --> 06:49.626
Yeah.

I'’m that guy.

Thank you.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.113
So what do you do?

06:58.200 --> 07:00.550
Nothing very exciting.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.073
Really?
What'’s that like?

07:02.160 --> 07:03.684
Oh, you know,
when your toilet overflows

07:03.771 --> 07:05.033
and you call someone to help
and they never show?

07:05.120 --> 07:06.251
Yeah.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.471
I'’m that guy.

07:08.558 --> 07:10.647
Oh, man, I hate that guy.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.257
You'’re not alone.

07:12.344 --> 07:15.086
So how are we doing
on the meat loaf?

07:15.173 --> 07:17.132
I put the eggs in.
What'’s next?

07:17.219 --> 07:19.221
Add a tablespoon of curry.

07:19.308 --> 07:21.005
A whole tablespoon?

07:21.092 --> 07:23.007
Will you trust me?

07:23.094 --> 07:25.270
Fine. I'’m putting it in.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.753
Okay, now really
put it in.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.364
How did you know?

07:32.452 --> 07:33.670
We'’ve been talking a while.

07:33.757 --> 07:36.368
I get that you
have trust issues.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.632
Nice. A guy who listens.

you his meat loaf recipe.

call you back.

I mean, hey,
you do whatever you want.

What was that about?

Wrong number.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.447
What happened to you?

08:11.534 --> 08:12.970
Oh, this?

work clothes.

08:18.193 --> 08:19.890
and so are these.

Yep. I also got my hair done.

Upstairs and downstairs.

in case I get laid in the fog.

on me before she did it.

new boobs next week.

It'’s not a monkey.
It'’s an orangutan.

to know each other.

he'’s a nice guy?I can tell.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.146
Did you Google him?No. We agreed
not to Google.

09:42.233 --> 09:45.062
Besides, neither of us
is looking to date.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.238
We'’re just enjoying
each other'’s company.

09:47.325 --> 09:50.677
You'’re not doing phone sex
or anything weird?

09:50.764 --> 09:55.551
Okay, first of all,
phone sex can be beautiful.

09:57.553 --> 10:00.251
And no, nothing'’s weird.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.645
All right.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.299
Where are you going so late?

10:04.386 --> 10:07.084
I have to go buy Jill
a box of condoms.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.391
And yes, it'’s weird.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.437
I'’m back.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.091
Everything okay?

10:14.178 --> 10:16.877
My daughter thinks
what we'’re doing is weird.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.530
Do you think it'’s weird?

10:18.618 --> 10:19.488
I don'’t care.
I'’m having fun.

10:19.575 --> 10:20.620
Me, too.

10:20.707 --> 10:21.751
You hungry?

10:21.838 --> 10:23.144
Uh, a little bit.

10:23.231 --> 10:25.015
Come on.
Let'’s go make a sandwich.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.148
Okay, now it'’s
a little weird.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.417
Jill?

10:35.504 --> 10:36.592
Thank God.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.942
I was running out of dirty talk.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.552
I didn'’t know what you liked,

10:40.640 --> 10:42.859
so I got flavored, ribbed
and glow-in-the-dark.

10:42.946 --> 10:45.253
I guess that'’s in case
you lose track of him.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.255
Extra large.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.561
You know me so well.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.781
I didn'’t know you
were seeing someone.

10:51.868 --> 10:52.956
Why didn'’t you tell me?

10:53.043 --> 10:55.480
Well, he'’s very private.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.482
[whispering]:
And kind of famous.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.223
You'’re having celebrity sex?

10:59.310 --> 11:00.921
Who is it?
Is it someone good?

11:01.008 --> 11:02.357
I'’m sorry.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.967
I really can'’t say.

11:04.054 --> 11:05.142
Hey, you owe me.

11:05.229 --> 11:06.361
I just got slut-shamed

11:06.448 --> 11:08.450
by the cashier at the pharmacy.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.626
No. Now I gotta go.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.063
I got a semi-aroused
household name upstairs.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.630
Wait, Jill, one more thing.

11:14.717 --> 11:15.805
What?

11:15.892 --> 11:18.460
Please tell me who it is?

11:18.547 --> 11:20.244
Good night.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.334
Wow.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.772
A famous person'’s putting
on a condom that I bought.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.778
[cell phone ringing]

11:34.258 --> 11:35.433
Hey, you.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.044
What are you doing?

11:37.131 --> 11:39.002
Actually, you caught me
coming out of the tub.

11:39.089 --> 11:41.048
I'’m dripping wet.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.310
Really?

11:42.397 --> 11:43.703
I just finished
working out,

11:43.790 --> 11:47.402
so I'’m all sweaty,
and, you know...

11:47.489 --> 11:49.578
feeling pretty darn good
about being a man.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.495
What are you really doing?

11:53.582 --> 11:55.323
I'’m in my underwear
eating cornflakes,

11:55.410 --> 11:57.368
watching a dog show.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.414
Looks like the Pomeranian'’s

11:59.501 --> 12:02.373
going to take the
whole freakin'’ thing.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.027
What are you
really doing?

12:04.114 --> 12:07.204
I am totally coming
out of the bathtub.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.641
[laughs]
Fine, be that way.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.121
So what do you
got going on today?

12:11.208 --> 12:12.732
Well, some stuff
around the building,

12:12.819 --> 12:14.429
and then I'’m off
to an AA meeting.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.213
Oh, you go to those
things every day?

12:16.300 --> 12:20.217
Just when I'’m feeling crazy,
so yeah.

12:20.304 --> 12:21.349
I'’m impressed.

12:21.436 --> 12:22.698
Thanks.

12:22.785 --> 12:23.873
[can opening]

12:23.960 --> 12:25.135
That was a beer can.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.789
I'’m toasting you.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.051
Please tell me you don'’t
drink light beer,

12:28.138 --> 12:29.226
'’cause that'’s a deal breaker.

12:29.313 --> 12:30.401
Light beer?

12:30.488 --> 12:31.576
None of the buzz
and all the pee?

12:31.663 --> 12:32.926
No, thanks.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.971
Oh, my God.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.494
Why don'’t you two
just meet already?

12:36.581 --> 12:37.669
Mind your own business.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.976
Adam, are you
a serial killer?

12:40.063 --> 12:41.630
Uh, no.

12:41.717 --> 12:44.154
Big cereal eater, though.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.461
There you go.
Nice guy. Nice lady.

12:46.548 --> 12:47.810
Hang up the phones,
pop a mint,

12:47.897 --> 12:49.203
and go get a cup of coffee.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.770
Get out of here.
Go to work.

12:52.206 --> 12:53.903
Sorry about that.[door closes]

12:53.990 --> 12:55.426
She'’s a little pushy.

12:55.513 --> 12:58.342
Wonder where she
gets it from.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.692
I mean, uh,
we don'’t need to meet, right?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.346
This is fun the way it is.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.783
This is great.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.393
I'’ve said things to you

13:05.480 --> 13:07.090
I'’ve never been able
to say to anyone else.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.878
Hello?

13:11.965 --> 13:13.270
Did I lose you?

13:13.357 --> 13:16.143
No. I-I'’m just thinking.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.277
I'’m a little curious.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.540
Yeah, me, too.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.805
I mean, we did already
take a nap together.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.373
That'’s true.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.463
You snore, by the way.

13:32.550 --> 13:35.945
Sorry. 20 years of cocaine
will make you a mouth breather.

13:36.032 --> 13:39.383
So should we do it?

13:39.470 --> 13:41.690
Yeah. Sure.

13:41.777 --> 13:44.040
Okay. Great. Tonight.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.781
Burgundy Bistro.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.783
8:00 and I'’ll wear a red scarf.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.829
I'’ll wear a Raiders cap.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.832
Well, the Niners would
be better, but okay.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.616
Oh, wait, you'’re not hiding
a bald spot, are you?

13:54.703 --> 13:56.052
Are you kidding me?

13:56.139 --> 13:59.316
I'’ve got the hair
of three men.

13:59.403 --> 14:02.450
As long s it'’s on your head,
I'’m in.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.021
Again, I'’m really sorry.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.849
Oh, stop. It'’s fine.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.807
Are you sure,
'’cause I'’d be happy

14:11.894 --> 14:13.940
to look into getting you
a new tennis coach.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.420
There is nothing wrong
with my tennis coach.

14:16.507 --> 14:17.857
You just got lucky.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.598
You'’re right.

14:20.685 --> 14:22.862
Three sets in a row.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.342
Okay. I think we'’re
done for today.

14:25.429 --> 14:27.257
Thank you very much.

14:27.344 --> 14:28.868
Oh, okay.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.174
So as of now,
I'’m off the clock?

14:31.261 --> 14:33.655
You are off the clock.

14:33.742 --> 14:36.658
So I can speak to you
as a friend.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.355
Of course.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.575
Who'’s the famous guy
you'’re sleeping with?

14:40.662 --> 14:43.186
I can'’t tell you that.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.667
Why?

14:45.754 --> 14:47.364
It'’s complicated.

14:47.451 --> 14:48.844
What do you mean, complicated?

14:50.498 --> 14:52.326
Oh, he'’s married.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.025
Oh, Jill,
Jill, Jill, Jill.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.027
See? This is why.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.116
Hey, I am not judging you.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.378
I'’ve made the same mistake.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.727
Not with a famous person.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.642
My guy was a loser.

15:04.729 --> 15:07.732
The point is,
it never ends well.

15:07.819 --> 15:10.387
Thank you for your concern.

15:10.474 --> 15:11.519
Are we done now?

15:11.606 --> 15:12.737
No.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.217
You'’re a smart, beautiful woman.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.697
You don'’t have to settle.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.438
I'’m not settling.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.093
We'’re very happy
with the way things are.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.398
Oh, really?

15:21.485 --> 15:23.748
Does your big celebrity
have any kids?

15:23.835 --> 15:25.881
Two.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.274
But they'’re very unpleasant,

15:27.361 --> 15:30.233
so your heart
doesn'’t go out to them.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.758
Do you really want to be
the kind of person

15:33.845 --> 15:35.238
who breaks up a family?

15:35.325 --> 15:37.893
I love him
and he loves me.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.068
How do you know?

15:39.155 --> 15:40.287
Because he told me.

15:41.636 --> 15:42.985
Okay, he'’s just... he'’s waiting

15:43.072 --> 15:44.508
for his daughter
to go off to college,

15:44.595 --> 15:46.597
and then he'’s asking
for a divorce.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.295
How old is his daughter?

15:48.382 --> 15:50.514
Six.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.866
Look, I know
what you'’re thinking,

15:54.954 --> 15:56.390
but I'’m willing to wait.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.045
He'’s worth it.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.437
Oh, come on.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.918
If he really loves you,
make him prove it.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.441
Tell him to choose.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.704
I can'’t do that.

16:06.791 --> 16:08.402
Why not?

16:09.533 --> 16:11.274
I don'’t know.

16:11.361 --> 16:15.626
I guess '’cause I'’m scared
that if I push too hard,

16:15.713 --> 16:17.933
I'’m gonna get an answer
I don'’t want to hear.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.458
Okay, well, it'’s your life.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.983
I just think you deserve better.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.333
Thank you.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.118
Now, if you'’ll excuse me,
I'’m going to go take a shower.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.728
Jill, wait. One more thing.

16:30.815 --> 16:31.903
What?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.731
Please tell me who it is.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.779
I'’ll let you beat me at tennis!

16:41.957 --> 16:43.306
Ready to order?

16:43.393 --> 16:45.004
No, thanks.
I'’m waiting for someone.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.179
Oh.

16:58.930 --> 17:02.021
I'’m sorry, but you look
horrible in that.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.606
Oh, man.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.608
She'’s beautiful.

17:36.272 --> 17:39.145
I can'’t.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.734
[crying]:
I can'’t believe
I took your advice

18:03.821 --> 18:06.172
and told him
he had to make a decision.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.522
Really?

18:08.609 --> 18:10.915
Was that my advice?

18:11.002 --> 18:15.485
I actually convinced myself
he was going to pick me.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.052
But he didn'’t.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.271
[blowing nose]

18:18.358 --> 18:19.446
[snorts]

18:23.014 --> 18:25.626
How could he give all this up?

18:25.713 --> 18:27.062
[crying]

18:27.149 --> 18:29.760
Oh, Jill, I-I'’m so sorry.

18:29.847 --> 18:32.285
But isn'’t it better
you found out now,

18:32.372 --> 18:34.243
rather than let him
string you along?

18:34.330 --> 18:36.376
No. '’Cause now I'’m all alone

18:36.463 --> 18:38.465
and miserable like you.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.426
Hey.

18:43.513 --> 18:44.601
Hey.

18:44.688 --> 18:45.907
How did it go with Adam?

18:45.994 --> 18:48.997
Um, nice guy,

18:49.084 --> 18:52.218
but I don'’t think
there'’s any real chemistry.

18:52.305 --> 18:53.958
Better off on the phone.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.569
Oh, I'’m sorry.

18:55.656 --> 18:56.787
No big deal.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.224
What'’s her problem?

18:58.311 --> 19:00.400
I broke up with you-know-who.

19:00.487 --> 19:03.359
Oh, well, we both knew
that was gonna happen.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.101
W-w-wait.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.930
You know who
you-know-who is?

19:09.017 --> 19:10.279
Yeah.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.629
You told her and
you won'’t tell me?

19:12.716 --> 19:15.154
She was there
when we met.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.373
Let'’s go in the kitchen
and I'’ll make you some tea.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.201
Thanks.

19:21.725 --> 19:24.119
Fine. Whatever.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.426
Keep your little secret.

19:26.513 --> 19:27.601
I don'’t care.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.259
Come on, you guys!
