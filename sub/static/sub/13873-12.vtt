Spacecataz.

00:10.977 --> 00:12.001
Do...

00:13.013 --> 00:16.779
My name is Shake-zula,
the mike ruler

00:16.816 --> 00:17.942
The old-schooler

00:17.984 --> 00:19.952
You want to trip,
I'll bring it to ya

00:19.986 --> 00:23.183
Frylock and I'm on top,

00:23.223 --> 00:25.783
Meatwad, you're up next

00:25.825 --> 00:28.225
Meatwad make the money, see?

00:28.261 --> 00:30.695
Meatwad get the honeys, G.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.290
Drivin' in my car,
livin' like a star

00:33.333 --> 00:36.302
Ice on my fingers and my toes
and I'm a Taurus

00:36.336 --> 00:39.203
Uh, check-check it, yeah

00:39.239 --> 00:41.230
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:41.274 --> 00:44.437
Make the homeys say ho
and the girlies want to scream

00:44.477 --> 00:47.207
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:47.247 --> 00:50.273
Make the homeys say ho
and the girlies want to scream

00:50.316 --> 00:52.181
Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.880
Number one in the 'hood, G.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.548
Shake,
come in here for a second!

00:56.589 --> 00:58.250
Hey, why don't you
just come in here?

00:58.291 --> 00:59.588
It'll be quicker.

00:59.626 --> 01:02.789
Ooh ooh! I heard that.

01:02.829 --> 01:04.797
Give him three seconds now.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.526
1, 2...

01:06.566 --> 01:07.760
Shake, will you please
get in here?!

01:07.801 --> 01:09.393
- Ah!
- He beat my projections.

01:09.436 --> 01:10.767
Just go see what he wants...

01:10.804 --> 01:12.999
and then tell me about it
afterwards.

01:13.039 --> 01:14.529
OK.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.344
Shake, come in here!

01:20.380 --> 01:21.745
Ah! God!

01:21.781 --> 01:24.511
Why must I be cursed
with such popularity?

01:24.551 --> 01:26.985
What? What?
Get out your cameras.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.580
I'm only signing for 5 minutes.
That's it!

01:29.622 --> 01:30.987
Take a look at this, Shake.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.821
I can see it from here.
It's a toilet seat.

01:32.859 --> 01:34.827
And you're a disgusting perv
for having it.

01:34.861 --> 01:36.522
Take a closer look.

01:38.031 --> 01:41.262
Wow! You've discovered germs!

01:41.301 --> 01:42.962
Now how about
you go discover soap?

01:43.002 --> 01:44.299
This is the same toilet seat...

01:44.337 --> 01:46.464
that you sat on at
that gas station in Branson...

01:46.506 --> 01:48.064
and it's covered
with hypnogerms!

01:48.108 --> 01:50.542
That is a lie, and you are
a liar for saying that.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.374
I've never been
to Branson in my life.

01:52.412 --> 01:53.572
Don't tell me
you don't remember that.

01:53.613 --> 01:54.602
It was just last week.

01:54.647 --> 01:56.308
Yeah, you ate
that batch of bad ribs...

01:56.349 --> 01:57.680
after the Gatlin Brothers
concert...

01:57.717 --> 02:00.686
and made Frylock blow the door
off that truck stop bathroom...

02:00.720 --> 02:03.314
because you said you couldn't
wait for the bathroom key?

02:03.356 --> 02:05.324
Squeezin' your butt together,
trying to keep it in?

02:05.358 --> 02:07.349
I don't even know
Charles Branson!

02:07.393 --> 02:09.156
Someone's losing
their mind, Jack...

02:09.195 --> 02:11.026
because that never happened!

02:11.064 --> 02:13.897
He's already lost his.
I'm lookin' at you, big boy.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.195
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

02:15.235 --> 02:18.329
Just blow the door off!
I can't hold it anymore!

02:18.371 --> 02:20.669
Oh! Oh!

02:20.707 --> 02:22.140
Oh, thank God!

02:22.175 --> 02:23.642
Wow, it's still just coming.

02:23.676 --> 02:24.665
Hold it right.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.235
I got it
upside right side down.

02:26.279 --> 02:28.975
- Where's the paper?!
- I'm the director...

02:29.015 --> 02:32.314
I want to see this again.
Rewind.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.013
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

02:34.053 --> 02:35.748
Just blow the door off...

02:35.788 --> 02:37.517
Yeah, that's not me.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.787
I mean, it's just...
It's clearly not me.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.225
Well, you're entitled
to your dumb-ass opinion...

02:41.261 --> 02:43.661
on where you think you were,
but the fact is...

02:43.696 --> 02:45.061
you didn't put paper
on that toilet seat...

02:45.098 --> 02:47.396
and I'm afraid you might be
infected by hypnogerms.

02:47.433 --> 02:50.061
Really? And that's what
you think, huh?

02:50.103 --> 02:53.436
Hold on. I think I may be able
to take care of this.

02:53.473 --> 02:56.169
Hey! Get in here!

03:03.049 --> 03:04.778
Tell him
I never been to Branson.

03:04.817 --> 03:07.217
- He's never been there!
- See?

03:07.253 --> 03:08.811
Uh, see what?

03:08.855 --> 03:11.187
Tell him again.
Maybe slow it down for him.

03:11.224 --> 03:13.089
He has never been there.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.993
He's never been there!

03:16.029 --> 03:17.462
All right, all right!

03:17.497 --> 03:19.362
Will everybody settle down,
please?

03:19.399 --> 03:20.423
We're not deaf!

03:20.466 --> 03:21.933
- He's never been there.
- OK.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.435
Uh, who are you talking to?

03:23.469 --> 03:26.905
You're serious.
Hey, I can be stupid, too.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.498
Tell him who I'm talking to.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.339
He's talking to the basketball.
What the...?

03:31.377 --> 03:32.742
Hey, where you been, man?

03:32.779 --> 03:35.009
I was looking for you.
I called you last Christmas.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.415
Your mom said that Chicken Face
was on Bone Row.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.180
He's pulling your chain!

03:40.220 --> 03:41.380
Yeah. I'm the basketball.

03:41.421 --> 03:42.581
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

03:44.023 --> 03:46.184
Love is a basketball and chain,
brother.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.420
- Come on.
- I know!

03:47.460 --> 03:48.620
That's what freed the fish, man.

03:48.661 --> 03:49.923
Yeah, I'm the basketball.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.261
I meant to tell them that.
It's only a matter of time.

03:52.298 --> 03:54.664
Time? Heh heh!
Time is an illusion.

03:54.701 --> 03:55.895
Yeah, I'm the basketball.

03:55.935 --> 03:58.165
The only time now is party time.
Are we clear?

03:58.204 --> 04:00.263
- Come on!
- Yeah, I'm the basketball.

04:00.373 --> 04:01.362
Lovely.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.568
You so got that
from a beer commercial!

04:03.610 --> 04:04.736
- Yeah.
- See? I told you!

04:04.777 --> 04:07.803
These guys are
totally out of control.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.806
Don't squeeze
the pancake batter.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.650
Hey, no. Don't interrupt.

04:14.687 --> 04:15.745
I'm talking to him.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.450
So what... what kind of germs
he got there?

04:18.491 --> 04:19.958
Hypnogerms, Meatwad.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.291
Their only interest
is to control your mind.

04:22.328 --> 04:25.354
Oh, yeah, that's right.
And I'm an asshole for asking.

04:25.398 --> 04:28.026
Mind control!

04:29.636 --> 04:33.595
You gotta have mind control

04:33.640 --> 04:39.169
If you want to take control
of your mind

04:39.212 --> 04:41.203
Hey! Thank you!

04:41.247 --> 04:42.908
You, sir, you got
a nice young lady with you.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.042
- What's your name?
- Phil Cabinet.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.382
You precious little thing!
Where you from, Phil?

04:47.420 --> 04:50.412
We're from... Kill yourself!

04:51.724 --> 04:53.658
All right.
Phil from Killyourself.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.661
And who's this with you?
Rrrrowrrr!

04:55.695 --> 04:57.026
This is my 6-month-old...

04:57.063 --> 04:58.758
and her name is
Wear a hat made out of foil.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.799
This is my wife... Lock yourself
in a cold, dark room.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.027
Hi.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.899
And how long have you two
lovely people been married?

05:03.936 --> 05:05.927
Oh, about smear yourself
with garbage...

05:05.972 --> 05:07.633
and try to cross the freeway.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.699
We just celebrated
our eat your own dung.

05:09.742 --> 05:11.300
Great to hear. Yummy, too.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.471
Hey, Phil,
thanks for coming out.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.572
Like the shirt,
both of you. You match.

05:17.517 --> 05:20.611
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for Tulip Sniper!

05:20.653 --> 05:22.280
Thank you. Thank you very much.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.313
Die. Die, all of you.

05:26.659 --> 05:27.785
Jackass!

05:27.827 --> 05:30.762
Um... I have
a two-part question...

05:30.797 --> 05:32.321
One... What's he doing now?

05:32.365 --> 05:34.595
Two... Should we light him
on fire?

05:34.634 --> 05:35.794
He's probably fallen prey...

05:35.835 --> 05:38.804
to one of their hideous
off-Broadway productions.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.169
But didn't you say...

05:40.206 --> 05:42.367
that their only interest
is mind control?

05:42.408 --> 05:46.037
Well, yes, and they also like
to star in plays.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.239
Star in plays?

05:47.280 --> 05:50.044
Oh, yes, Meatwad.
Plays that they've written...

05:50.083 --> 05:51.641
after they've been drinking.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.777
- After they've been drinking?
- On the weekends.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.050
- On the weekend...
- Will you stop repeating me?!

05:56.089 --> 05:57.716
Damn! Everything I say.

05:57.757 --> 05:59.691
- Everything you say?
- Meat...

05:59.792 --> 06:01.589
You still think
I'm an asshole, don't you?

06:01.627 --> 06:03.652
Well, what you gonna do now?

06:03.696 --> 06:06.290
Well, Meatwad, there's only
one thing we can do.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.391
- These beans.
- Those beans?

06:08.434 --> 06:10.925
Yes, Meatwad,
these Mexican jumping beans...

06:10.970 --> 06:13.564
are the only known enemy
to the hypnogerm.

06:13.606 --> 06:17.064
Now they must confront
each other inside his brain.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.372
OK.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here

06:27.653 --> 06:28.813
Germ Master!

06:28.855 --> 06:31.153
Beans are invading
from the west!

06:32.658 --> 06:34.956
It's Pancho. He's come for me.

06:34.994 --> 06:36.484
Young Donna...

06:36.529 --> 06:40.932
you must understand
that the beans are lowlifes.

06:40.967 --> 06:45.267
Bean and germ must never mate

06:45.304 --> 06:52.506
It is written on this grape

06:54.046 --> 06:55.741
But, Father!

06:57.450 --> 06:59.281
But, Father...

06:59.385 --> 07:01.512
But, Father...

07:01.554 --> 07:04.614
- But, Father...
- Take her to the epiglottis!

07:04.657 --> 07:08.753
And so, she was imprisoned
in the flabby epiglottis...

07:08.795 --> 07:10.763
for a thousand years...

07:10.797 --> 07:16.531
because of her love
for one overweight bean.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.833
Psst! Hey. Donna.

07:18.871 --> 07:20.600
Pancho! You've come for me!

07:20.640 --> 07:22.574
<i>Donna, shh! Callete, niña.</i>

07:22.608 --> 07:23.768
How did you find me?

07:23.810 --> 07:26.540
Oh, you know,
it's, like, my love for you...

07:26.579 --> 07:29.343
carried me here
like a thousand rivers, mang.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.974
Hold on, honey.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.553
I'm sorry.
What? What did you say?

07:34.587 --> 07:36.953
Did you just do
what I think you did?

07:36.989 --> 07:39.753
Ugh. You told me
you didn't do that, mang.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.919
Not in front of you. Silly.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.759
Yeah, OK, that's all...
OK, well, go back... listen...

07:44.797 --> 07:46.321
we're gonna battle
your dad, mang, OK?

07:46.365 --> 07:48.196
You got to tell him
to lay off, please, OK?

07:48.234 --> 07:50.327
I don't ever see him... mang.

07:50.369 --> 07:51.836
OK, look, here's the deal, OK.

07:51.871 --> 07:53.304
I'll be back here
tomorrow, mang...

07:53.339 --> 07:55.500
'cause, you know, I love you
and I'll never leave you...

07:55.541 --> 07:58.442
until you are free
from this prison... OK?

07:58.478 --> 08:01.174
But how?
How will I ever get free?

08:01.214 --> 08:03.512
You must grow your hair and...

08:03.549 --> 08:06.143
and then... you know,
we do something with it.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.675
Something crazy, you know.

08:07.720 --> 08:11.156
And that was the last
Donna ever saw of Pancho...

08:11.190 --> 08:12.521
for two weeks later...

08:12.558 --> 08:14.924
he met a younger,
more illegal bean...

08:14.961 --> 08:18.453
who wasn't in prison, and
she bore him many children...

08:18.498 --> 08:20.830
and sued his ass
for custody of them.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.528
But one day...

08:22.568 --> 08:25.969
Pancho!
You've come back! For me!

08:26.005 --> 08:27.370
Yeah, no...! Shut up!

08:27.406 --> 08:28.873
Damn. Let your hair down.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.876
Pancho climbed her hair...

08:30.910 --> 08:32.605
and when he reached the top...

08:32.645 --> 08:36.547
he looked in his long-lost
lover's eyes and said...

08:36.582 --> 08:37.981
Ohhh.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.952
Ay, gross! From your nose?

08:40.986 --> 08:43.649
You know, eh, Donna,
I've been thinking...

08:43.688 --> 08:45.657
you know, I... I don't want
to break your heart...

08:45.691 --> 08:48.251
and I'm going through
a lot of... right now...

08:48.294 --> 08:49.761
got a lot of work to do...

08:49.795 --> 08:52.161
and I'm not the best guy
in the world, you know.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.961
I'm not right for you.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.968
I got to think about things
a little bit, OK?

08:56.002 --> 08:58.163
It'll work out somehow,
but, yeah, give me that hair.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.570
And he snipped the nose hair
from her breathing cavities.

09:00.673 --> 09:01.662
Gracias.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.436
Because he thought
he knew someone...

09:03.476 --> 09:05.205
who could spin nose hair
into gold.

09:05.244 --> 09:07.235
Now spin it into gold, man.

09:09.815 --> 09:12.181
Donna's heart was shattered.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.686
No, Pancho! No!

09:14.720 --> 09:15.846
Fortunately for her...

09:15.888 --> 09:17.947
she turned into
the Incredible Hulk...

09:18.958 --> 09:20.653
But not
the Marvel comic Hulk...

09:20.693 --> 09:23.924
a totally different Hulk
that we made up.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.988
Hulk mad!

09:26.032 --> 09:30.093
And Donna took Pancho's body
to the bean wizard.

09:30.136 --> 09:33.435
Oh, bean wizard,
can you help me?

09:33.472 --> 09:42.403
I'll see!

09:48.354 --> 09:50.720
He's been shot in the head.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.781
I can't raise him from the dead

09:52.825 --> 09:56.488
If he's been shot in the head

09:56.529 --> 10:00.795
My powers are limit... ed

10:00.833 --> 10:02.733
But isn't there anything?

10:05.738 --> 10:09.936
But isn't there
anything you can do?

10:09.976 --> 10:11.068
Maybe.

10:12.411 --> 10:14.743
Probably.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.338
Definitely!

10:16.382 --> 10:19.374
A zombie

10:19.418 --> 10:22.046
Oh! Thank you, bean wizard.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.079
- Brains!
- Oh, wait. No, no, no. Ow.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.784
Brains!

10:25.825 --> 10:26.985
<i>Ay, que deliciisi.</i>

10:27.026 --> 10:30.723
And so the bean zombie
terrorized the countryside...

10:30.763 --> 10:32.162
for a thousand years...

10:32.198 --> 10:34.928
and the beans
drove the hypnogerms...

10:34.967 --> 10:36.730
out of the countryside...

10:36.769 --> 10:39.203
led by
their zombiefied prince...

10:39.238 --> 10:41.900
where they would rule
the countryside...

10:41.941 --> 10:44.239
for a thousand years.

10:44.276 --> 10:45.300
Well, looks like it's working.

10:45.344 --> 10:46.504
The beans are obviously winning.

10:46.545 --> 10:48.706
<i>Ay, miis Dii!</i>

10:48.748 --> 10:50.375
Damn. What's he doing?

10:50.416 --> 10:52.316
Oh, he's just passing gas
out of his ocular cavities.

10:52.351 --> 10:55.411
I told you there'd be
side effects, you know.

10:55.454 --> 10:57.752
Yep, he's Mexican now.

11:02.628 --> 11:04.994
Congratulations!
You're our new contestant!

11:05.031 --> 11:07.761
Whoa! What? Wait a minute.
Where did the hypnogerms go?

11:07.800 --> 11:10.098
Oh, yeah.
They went up your butt.

11:10.136 --> 11:13.128
Who's the asshole now?
I'm outta here, dude.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.367
Dancing is forbidden

11:15.408 --> 11:18.400
D- D-Dancing is forbidden

11:18.444 --> 11:20.708
Dancing is forbidden

11:20.746 --> 11:23.374
D- D-Dancing is forbidden

11:23.416 --> 11:25.543
D- Dancing is forbidden

11:26.305 --> 11:32.522
