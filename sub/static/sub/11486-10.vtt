WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:05.150
- What you doing?
- I'm working.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.790
You're not gonna get much done
with the TV on.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.629
- What are you, my mother?
- Your mother says that too?

00:12.880 --> 00:14.871
Listen, when you write music
for a living...

00:15.040 --> 00:16.678
...you have to wait for inspiration.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.877
Nope, not yet.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.591
Charlie, wanna come
to the movies with us?

00:24.760 --> 00:26.955
He can't. He's working.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.717
- On what, liver failure?
- Wonderful.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.916
He's my mother, you're my doctor.

00:33.480 --> 00:36.870
Oh, I assume you finished reading
<i>Lord of the Flies</i> for your book report.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.473
Oh, good. How'd you like it?

00:39.160 --> 00:42.835
I thought it was
a timeless American classic.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.116
I see. So tell me, what's it about?

00:47.480 --> 00:51.393
- You mean the book?
- Yeah, the book.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.512
It's called <i>Lord of the Flies...</i>

00:55.320 --> 00:59.393
...and it's about a really big fly...

00:59.560 --> 01:02.518
...that all the other flies pray to.

01:04.280 --> 01:09.070
- And you thought he didn't read it.
- Oh, I was just joking.

01:11.440 --> 01:15.638
It's more like <i>Charlotte's Web,</i>
but from the fly's point of view.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.039
You've had more than a week.
Why didn't you read the book?

01:21.640 --> 01:26.555
- I've been waiting for inspiration.
- Attaboy.

01:26.760 --> 01:30.070
Okay, how's this for inspiration?
We're not going to the movies...

01:30.240 --> 01:33.357
...and you're not doing anything
until you finish reading that book.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.754
- That's not fair.
- Course it's fair. We had a deal.

01:36.920 --> 01:40.629
- You didn't keep your end of it.
- Oh, so now two wrongs make a right?

01:42.080 --> 01:43.798
Bet you didn't see that one coming.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.833
You're really gonna like this book
if you give it a chance.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.514
It's about kids
stranded on a deserted island.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.234
- How'd they get stranded?
- Their plane crashes.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.237
Oh, really. And then what happens?

01:55.400 --> 01:59.313
This one kid named Ralph becomes their
leader, and they form this society, and...

01:59.760 --> 02:01.796
Just read the book.

02:04.160 --> 02:09.757
- One big fly, huh?
- Hey, I took a shot.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:24.720 --> 02:26.233
Hi.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.752
- Charlie's working, Rose.
- Oh, what about Jake?

02:31.800 --> 02:33.552
He's studying.

02:34.360 --> 02:37.875
- Hey, do you like smoked salmon?
- I guess.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.196
Good. Then this is for you.

02:44.600 --> 02:48.798
- I don't know what to say.
- Neither do I, most of the time.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.793
But then I start talking,
and stuff just comes out.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.558
So, what are you doing
this fine Saturday night?

02:57.040 --> 02:59.076
I was supposed go to the movies
with Jake...

02:59.240 --> 03:01.231
...but he didn't
do his homework, so...

03:01.440 --> 03:05.274
So you're punishing him by sitting out
here all by yourself, alone and miserable.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.431
What a good dad.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.354
If you still wanna go to the movies,
I'll go with you.

03:11.920 --> 03:16.948
- You and me? Like a...? Like a date?
- Alan, are you asking me out?

03:17.600 --> 03:21.115
- I don't think so.
- Okay.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.312
That was a little awkward.
Come on, we'll catch an early show.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.398
Oh, all right. All right, why not.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.875
I'll sneak in the salmon
under my sweater.

03:32.320 --> 03:36.791
Good. That way, we don't have to pay
for that overpriced movie fish.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.029
- Hey. What you doing?
- Working.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.875
How do you know
when you're on a break?

03:45.040 --> 03:48.669
That's the thing about being a grownup,
my little friend: You don't get breaks.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.310
Is this the new
<i>Oshikuru: Demon Samura√Ø?</i>

03:56.040 --> 03:57.917
- Yeah.
- What are you doing with it?

03:58.080 --> 04:01.868
It's being turned into a cartoon, and they
asked me to write the theme song.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.031
- Awesome.
- Yeah?

04:04.200 --> 04:06.668
- Wanna hear what I got so far?
- Sure.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.513
So I'll be, like, the first kid in the world
to hear this.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.318
Yep.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.070
Now, this is just a rough version,
but you get an idea of the feel of it.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.673
Okay.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.519
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru</i>
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru</i>

04:24.680 --> 04:29.196
<i>My, oh, my</i>
<i>He's a demon samurai</i>

04:29.560 --> 04:32.870
<i>Who 's the guy who had to die?</i>
<i>Oshikuru</i>

04:33.360 --> 04:36.955
Boy. That really blows.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.874
Excuse me?

04:40.320 --> 04:44.393
- Did you even read the comic?
- Yeah, I looked it over.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.591
Oh, really? What's it about?

04:48.920 --> 04:51.718
It's about this guy named Oshikuru,
who dies...

04:51.880 --> 04:55.668
...and comes back as a,
what do you call it, samurai.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.559
- And he's a demon.
- No.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.712
It's about a teenage boy
in a futuristic society...

05:01.880 --> 05:05.236
...who's possessed by the tortured soul
of a feudal Japanese warrior...

05:05.400 --> 05:08.551
...condemned to walk the earth
fighting the evil he once embodied.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.877
So, what's your point?

05:11.040 --> 05:14.350
He lives in a dark world.
He battles the spirits of the damned.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.717
Your theme doesn't
capture the mood at all. It just blows.

05:18.120 --> 05:23.114
- Okay, okay, you said "blows" already.
- Did I say "big baby chunks"?

05:24.280 --> 05:26.430
All right, fine. Thanks for your input.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.913
Why don't you go read <i>Lord of the Flies,</i>
and let me do my job.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.834
Well, if your job is ruining a great
comic book, you can call it a night.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.395
- I heard that.
- Good.

05:39.920 --> 05:44.391
Oh, no. What do you wanna bet
Shrek here sits right in front of us.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.118
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.878
You had to eat the chili cheeseburger.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.714
- That wasn't really necessary.
- You'd have done the same thing for me.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.231
I'm not so sure.

06:03.680 --> 06:07.593
- So, Alan, tell me about yourself.
- What would you like to know?

06:07.960 --> 06:10.394
Everything. I really don't know
that much about you...

06:10.560 --> 06:13.916
...aside from the fact that you're
Charlie's brother and Jake's dad.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.516
Graduated from Cal State Long Beach,
married your college sweetheart...

06:17.680 --> 06:21.559
...and in the middle of the night, when
you're half-asleep, you pee sitting down.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.038
- Have you been spying on me?
- No, silly.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.988
I spy on Charlie.
You just get in the way sometimes.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.153
You know what?
Why don't you tell me about you.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.073
Well, okay. Well, let's see.

06:35.240 --> 06:39.074
I, too, pee sitting down,
so we have that in common.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.876
I come from a wealthy family, so I guess
I've had kind of a sheltered life.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.395
You know, fancy private schools
and colleges.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.437
- No kidding.
- What college did you go to?

06:47.600 --> 06:49.272
Princeton. But just for two years.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.156
- Oh, so you dropped out?
- No, I finished.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.238
Then I came back to California
to do my master's at Stanford.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.715
That's amazing.
What's your degree in?

07:04.560 --> 07:05.959
Behavioral psychology.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.713
Hey, Jake. Jake, wake up.
I want you to hear something.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.070
- What?
- I've been working on the song.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.716
- Good for you.
- Come on. Come listen to it.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.555
- I'm sleeping.
- Sleep in school, like everybody else.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.277
I read the comic books cover to cover.

07:29.440 --> 07:32.238
I know the characters,
I know their world.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.597
I think I got it. Listen.

07:37.160 --> 07:42.393
<i>A teenage boy with the spirit inside</i>
<i>Of a samurai warrior who long ago died</i>

07:42.720 --> 07:46.633
<i>Now he's oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru</i>

07:46.800 --> 07:49.872
<i>Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru</i>

07:50.040 --> 07:54.875
<i>My, oh, my</i>
<i>He's a demon samurai</i>

07:55.040 --> 07:58.715
<i>Who 's the guy who had to die?</i>
<i>Oshikuru</i>

08:00.600 --> 08:02.556
Still blows.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.671
Yeah, well, you're still short.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.473
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.438
Sorry I'm late. We stopped
for a bite to eat after the movie.

08:14.760 --> 08:18.799
- No problem.
- An usher confiscated our fish.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.835
- Hey, can I play you something?
- Sure.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.070
You know, I had a really good time
with Rose.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.390
There's a lot more there
than meets the eye.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.354
Yeah. Cool. Listen to this.
Tell me what you think.

08:33.039 --> 08:38.318
<i>A teenage boy with the spirit inside</i>
<i>Of a samurai warrior who long ago died</i>

08:38.480 --> 08:42.313
<i>Now he's oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru</i>

08:42.480 --> 08:45.472
<i>Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru</i>

08:45.640 --> 08:50.714
<i>My, oh, my</i>
<i>He's a demon samurai</i>

08:50.880 --> 08:54.316
<i>Who 's the guy who had to die?</i>
<i>Oshikuru</i>

08:54.680 --> 08:57.148
Very nice. It's snappy.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.550
- You really like it?
- Yeah, yeah. Good work.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.991
Okay, that settles it. It blows.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.709
Berta, you know what's a good book?
<i>Lord of the Flies.</i>

09:13.880 --> 09:16.678
Oh, yeah. I read that
when I was about your age.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.348
- So, what'd you think?
- I liked it.

09:19.520 --> 09:25.709
- It was like <i>Survivor</i> with kids.
- Yeah. I agree.

09:28.560 --> 09:32.792
- Is <i>Survivor</i> spelled like it sounds?
- Just read the damn book.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.713
- Morning, Berta.
- Morning.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.873
Hey, did you know that Rose
has a master's degree in psychology?

09:40.040 --> 09:43.191
No. Did you know I'm a
founding member of the Mile High Club?

09:44.120 --> 09:47.112
- Really?
- Yeah. Me and Orville at Kitty Hawk.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.477
I'd have done Wilbur too, but we were
only in the air for 90 seconds.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.798
Okay, you're kidding, and it's funny.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.599
But the truth is, you and I
see each other every day...

09:57.760 --> 09:59.671
...and we don't know
much about each other.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.157
So you wanna know what goes on
underneath this gruff exterior.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.959
Whether somewhere inside me,
there's a tiny little girl...

10:06.120 --> 10:08.315
...who once dreamed of being
a famous ballerina.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.072
- Is there?
- Lf there is...

10:10.240 --> 10:13.471
...it's because I accidentally ate one
and haven't passed her yet.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.316
Let me tell you,
I am dreading that tiara.

10:18.360 --> 10:23.070
- Okay. Well, it was nice talking to you.
- Hey, I feel closer.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.515
Oh, are you starting
that book report already?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.952
- Just making notes.
- Good for you. What do you have so far?

10:31.360 --> 10:34.477
<i>Lord of the Flies</i> is kind of like <i>Survivor,</i>
but with kids.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.233
That's an interesting analogy.
What's your favorite part?

10:40.960 --> 10:43.872
When the first kid
gets voted off the island?

10:49.480 --> 10:51.675
Hey, all right.

10:52.240 --> 10:55.471
Stop trying to be friends with Berta.
It just pisses her off.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.513
What doesn't?

10:57.720 --> 11:00.996
Hey, I was gonna do some shopping,
and was hoping you could watch Jake.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.760
- Sure.
- Ready when you are, Alan.

11:03.920 --> 11:07.071
- Be right there. I'll see you later.
- No, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.516
- You're going out with Rose again?
- No, I'm not "going out" with her.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.797
- We're just going shopping.
- Morning, Charlie.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.158
You haven't forgotten
that she's a little bent, right?

11:18.080 --> 11:20.310
No, I think there's a lot more to her
than that.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.871
- Deep down, there's a good person.
- Deep down, there's a few good people.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.679
And all of them are bent.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.595
- He'll be right with you, Rose.
- Okay.

11:30.760 --> 11:33.354
- Charlie, everybody has flaws.
- Flaws?

11:33.520 --> 11:36.876
She Superglued my testicles
to my thigh.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.873
That was the past.
We've all done things we're ashamed of.

11:41.040 --> 11:45.033
She's not ashamed. She took a picture,
then used it for her Christmas card.

11:46.440 --> 11:50.558
Thank God it was an extreme close-up.
Most people thought it was a fruit bat.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.237
Okay, well,
I appreciate your concern...

11:54.400 --> 11:57.119
...but I think Rose is a sweet,
smart, interesting woman.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.669
I enjoy spending time with her.
Meet me out front.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.433
Okey-dokey.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.952
- Hey, what're you doing?
- Reading <i>Lord of the Flies.</i>

12:09.120 --> 12:11.031
Not important.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.398
- Now, listen. You're a kid, right?
- Yeah.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.152
Okay. I'm writing a song for kids.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.709
So assuming that
what I've done already blows...

12:19.880 --> 12:21.836
- It does.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.468
Assuming that, you need to help me
make it better.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.108
- But I have to do a book report.
- Okay.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.113
I'll help you with the book report.
You help me with the song.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.477
- Quid pro quo.
- No.

12:33.640 --> 12:37.428
"Oshikuru."

12:40.720 --> 12:43.837
Here you go. Raspberry-mango-banana
with a shot of wheatgrass.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.998
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.673
You know, sometimes
I like to come to the mall...

12:50.840 --> 12:53.877
...and just watch people and make up
stories about who they are...

12:54.040 --> 12:57.350
...and what their lives are like.
- Oh, well, that's fun.

12:57.520 --> 13:01.308
What about that lady over there?
What do you think her life is like?

13:01.480 --> 13:05.996
Well, I'd say she's a smart woman,
but very Ionely.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.789
So used to rejection, it's become
like the air she breathes...

13:09.960 --> 13:13.999
...which is all the more sad
because she's got so much to give.

13:14.160 --> 13:19.598
Emotionally, spiritually, sexually.
Especially sexually.

13:19.760 --> 13:24.311
She is ripe, smoldering
and willing to try anything.

13:32.680 --> 13:37.151
- What about that lady over there?
- Her?

13:37.560 --> 13:41.155
Well, let's see.
She's a little tougher to read.

13:41.360 --> 13:46.559
I'd say she's a smart woman,
very Ionely.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.918
So used to rejection, it's become
like the air she breathes...

13:52.080 --> 13:53.559
...which is all the more sad...

13:53.720 --> 13:57.633
See, even though <i>Oshikuru</i> is for kids,
it's not really a kids' comic.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.429
- It's very mature.
- Okay, I think I got it.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.433
The demons Oshikuru fights
only exist...

14:04.600 --> 14:08.912
...because they are a reflection
of the tortured demons in his own soul.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.914
- Yes.
- So, in essence...

14:12.080 --> 14:16.232
<i>...Oshikuru</i> is like a Japanese
sci-fi version of <i>Moby Dick.</i>

14:19.640 --> 14:22.996
- What?
- You said, <i>"Moby Dick."</i>

14:25.120 --> 14:27.714
I mean, sure, being single
can be Ionely sometimes...

14:27.880 --> 14:32.032
...but it's better than being together
with someone you don't love or respect.

14:32.200 --> 14:37.069
- Is that what your marriage was like?
- Well, according to my ex-wife, it was.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.752
Hey, as long as we're done here...

14:39.920 --> 14:42.832
...why don't we take a drive
down to the beach and take a walk.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.508
- Alan, are you flirting with me?
- Oh, no, no.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.114
I just thought, you know,
since it's a beautiful day...

14:48.280 --> 14:50.077
If you are, it's okay.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.829
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.276
There's a lot more to you
than I thought.

14:58.080 --> 15:02.995
- What did you think?
- Oh, let's not spoil the moment.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.670
Okay. So, what do we do now?

15:08.960 --> 15:14.239
- Wanna try kissing?
- Yes, I think we should.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.438
- Okay.
- Yeah.

15:25.600 --> 15:29.149
- Wanna get a room?
- Excuse me?

15:29.760 --> 15:33.230
Or we can go back to my place,
unless you're afraid of ferrets.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.115
- Ferrets?
- Yeah.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.352
I have five of the toothy little guys.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.675
No kidding. Five ferrets.

15:45.840 --> 15:51.039
- Those are like long, furry rats, right?
- Yep.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.555
And they're all named Charlie.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.673
Of course they are.

15:57.840 --> 16:01.310
Well, as much as I would
love to meet...

16:01.480 --> 16:04.517
...Charlie and Charlie
and Charlie and Charlie...

16:04.680 --> 16:07.148
- And Charlie.
- Right.

16:07.320 --> 16:11.950
I can't help but wonder, is it worth
putting our friendship at risk?

16:12.560 --> 16:16.348
Well, that's a good question.
Let's think about it for a minute.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.871
How good are you in bed?
Because I'm excellent.

16:23.240 --> 16:28.075
Truthfully, I'm more of
an advanced intermediate.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.511
- Then let's stay friends.
- Yeah, good idea.

16:33.440 --> 16:36.113
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

16:36.280 --> 16:39.989
What, specifically, turned you off
to the idea of a physical liaison?

16:40.360 --> 16:44.672
Was it the psychosexual fraternal rivalry,
symbolized by the Charlie surrogates?

16:44.840 --> 16:46.876
Or the prospect
of being judged inadequate...

16:47.040 --> 16:49.998
...by a woman who professes to have
superior sexual skills?

16:50.240 --> 16:53.630
Wait a minute. Have you been doing
that behavioral psychology thing on me?

16:53.800 --> 16:55.836
No, don't be silly.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.677
But if I said yes, would that
make you feel A, angry, or B, insecure?

18:20.120 --> 18:22.429
I thought you were gonna
write the report for me.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.830
No, Jake. That would be wrong.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.434
The only way to learn
is to do the work yourself.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.988
Now, these are called <i>Cliff Notes.</i>

18:33.760 --> 18:36.593
Inside is everything you need to know
about <i>Lord of the Flies.</i>

18:36.760 --> 18:38.751
The themes, the characters,
the symbolism.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.753
It's a book report waiting for you
to put your name on it.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.834
Is that legal?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.195
Look around.
Do you see any homework police?

18:52.040 --> 18:55.669
Oh, man. I give you
way too much credit.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.917
Oh, I meant to ask you,
how'd that book report turn out?

19:03.080 --> 19:05.992
- I got a D-minus.
- D-minus?

19:06.360 --> 19:10.194
- Didn't you read the <i>Cliff Notes?</i>
- That was 50 pages.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.233
Unbelievable. Your kid's too lazy
to cheat.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.273
Has it occurred to you that maybe
he's too honest to cheat?

19:17.880 --> 19:19.871
No, I'm lazy.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.790
- <i>Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.</i>
- Hey, it's on.

19:24.760 --> 19:31.233
<i>Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru</i>
<i>Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru</i>

19:31.400 --> 19:36.235
<i>My, oh, my</i>
<i>He's a demon samurai</i>

19:36.400 --> 19:40.029
<i>Who 's the guy who had to die?</i>
<i>Oshikuru</i>

19:40.200 --> 19:43.670
That's not what we wrote.
That's your original, sucky version.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.634
What can I tell you?
The network liked that one better.

19:46.800 --> 19:51.920
- What, are they brain-damaged?
- Welcome to show business, kid.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.270
I still think it's snappy.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.230
<i>Oshikuru</i>

20:20.160 --> 20:22.151
