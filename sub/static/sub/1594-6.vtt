00:08.200 --> 00:11.734
Last week on Shameless,
this is what we were doing:

00:11.734 --> 00:13.467
Your house is
Frank's wet dream.

00:13.467 --> 00:15.233
Never gonna get him out.

00:15.233 --> 00:16.367
EDDIE: Turns out
I can't afford

00:16.367 --> 00:18.000
to live somewhere else
and support you two.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.233
Why can't you stay
with Uncle Ray?

00:19.233 --> 00:21.400
When I get back, I want the new
stock shelved with all the

00:21.400 --> 00:23.200
labels facing
the same direction.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.600
We're gonna have a whole
night together to celebrate.

00:24.600 --> 00:25.767
This is your house...

00:25.767 --> 00:27.300
where you live with Linda
and the kids.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.667
I'm gay, dude, not queer.

00:28.667 --> 00:30.767
Five hundred and
eight-seven dollars.

00:30.767 --> 00:34.000
I'm taking the PSAT's for some
Polish kid over in Ridgedale?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.367
I told Richie that
your rates went up.

00:35.367 --> 00:36.333
so he's giving you $150.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.300
See you in three hours.
Be out in two.

00:41.567 --> 00:43.734
I am going to a wedding today.

00:43.734 --> 00:45.767
I am really gonna do it
this time.

00:45.767 --> 00:47.266
You're coming, Mom?

00:47.266 --> 00:50.400
I'll just get you
a piece of cake, Mom.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.300
That would just be...

02:10.633 --> 02:12.633
(faucet running,
radio broadcast plays quietly)

02:33.600 --> 02:35.500
(quietly):
Mm.

02:38.233 --> 02:40.333
(quietly):
Mm.

02:40.333 --> 02:41.433
Mm.

02:41.433 --> 02:43.200
Brush your teeth;
I want to play.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.467
Smoothie.
Thanks.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.567
Hello, Liam.

02:58.567 --> 03:00.633
How you doin', huh?

03:00.633 --> 03:03.333
(Debbie sighs)

03:03.333 --> 03:05.667
Didn't Fiona tell you
to stop electrocuting dolls?

03:05.667 --> 03:08.400
They have to pay for their sins.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.100
(passionate breathing)

03:15.100 --> 03:16.633
You almost there?

03:16.633 --> 03:18.633
What?
I got to make lunches.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.300
Oh, tell me more.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.600
Well, first
I cut off the crusts...

03:22.600 --> 03:26.100
Uh-huh.
...and then I put
the apple slices in a baggie...

03:26.100 --> 03:29.100
Oh, don't stop.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.700
(whispers):
You look amazing.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.000
Hurry up.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.166
I don't want to go
before you.

03:34.166 --> 03:36.266
I already had a couple.

03:36.266 --> 03:38.767
You didn't make a sound.

03:38.767 --> 03:42.066
Big family; thin walls.

03:42.066 --> 03:43.266
When you consider
how humans evolved,

03:43.266 --> 03:46.066
they were probably used
to mating in public.

03:46.066 --> 03:49.066
But one day a pioneer that
really wanted to get freaky...
Steve...

03:49.066 --> 03:50.500
What? What?
Steve, I'm late.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.533
Focus.

03:51.533 --> 03:53.600
(both panting)

03:56.633 --> 03:58.467
Damn it! Carl!

03:58.467 --> 04:00.133
CARL:
It's not me!

04:00.133 --> 04:02.266
Hector's at
the pole again!

04:02.266 --> 04:04.133
Hector!

04:06.133 --> 04:07.533
Hey, Hector...

04:07.533 --> 04:08.767
is there any way
that you could...

04:08.767 --> 04:10.266
I can't this time, Fiona.

04:10.266 --> 04:11.633
It's the third red notice
this year. I'm sorry.

04:11.633 --> 04:14.533
Not the first time we got
shut off; won't be the last.

04:14.533 --> 04:16.467
Is there any way that you can
scrape the money together today?

04:16.467 --> 04:17.400
We have it.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.767
She just forgot
to pay it.

04:18.767 --> 04:22.166
I took an extra shift yesterday,
and I just spaced it.

04:22.166 --> 04:23.600
Call my cell phone
when you pay it,

04:23.600 --> 04:25.300
I'll swing back at
the end of the day.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.200
Thanks, Hector.

04:29.467 --> 04:32.200
(sighs)

04:33.300 --> 04:35.533
"Arts and Leisure"?
So I can read about

04:35.533 --> 04:39.166
pagan-worshipping actors
complaining about how
America sucks?

04:39.166 --> 04:41.567
I'll stick to my steroid-riddled
athletes, thank you.

04:41.567 --> 04:43.233
So...

04:43.233 --> 04:44.667
what's the verdict?

04:44.667 --> 04:47.700
The banana and blueberry
are spectacular.
Oh!

04:47.700 --> 04:50.166
KAREN:
So good, Mom.
Really?

04:53.333 --> 04:57.367
So, tonight we are going
to go off the beaten path.

04:57.367 --> 04:58.633
We are going

04:58.633 --> 05:00.233
to have...

05:00.233 --> 05:02.133
Hungarian night.

05:02.133 --> 05:04.200
All right? We're
gonna have hurka
FRANK: Mm!

05:04.200 --> 05:06.333
and toltott tojas
and rakott krumpli!

05:06.333 --> 05:09.734
Guaranteed to exit your colon
at the speed of sound.

05:09.734 --> 05:10.767
Huh!

05:12.033 --> 05:13.567
Mom...

05:13.567 --> 05:15.233
it's Parents Night
at school tonight.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.066
Right.

05:19.066 --> 05:20.200
Right. I will be
there, sweetie.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.266
I've been working

05:21.266 --> 05:23.400
towards that.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.200
That's right, I have it
right on my calendar.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.266
I circled it.
I've just been,
I've just been

05:28.266 --> 05:30.433
busy, busy, but I will be there.

05:30.433 --> 05:33.533
Dad, will you join us
at Parents Night tonight?

05:33.533 --> 05:35.166
Me?

05:35.166 --> 05:36.400
Not you, fuckface.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.166
I was talking to Daddy Frank.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.467
Daddy Frank,
will you come?

05:40.467 --> 05:42.633
Oh... no, no,

05:42.633 --> 05:44.266
ladies--
I don't do school.

05:44.266 --> 05:46.533
We all have our phobias,
and school is mine.

05:46.533 --> 05:47.767
All of it.

05:47.767 --> 05:49.200
Textbooks full
of falsehoods,

05:49.200 --> 05:50.300
teachers' unions

05:50.300 --> 05:52.100
full of thugs,

05:52.100 --> 05:53.400
and tenured imbeciles

05:53.400 --> 05:56.133
who still use words
like "irregardless."

05:56.133 --> 05:57.233
Not for me.

05:57.233 --> 05:58.266
However,

05:58.266 --> 06:00.700
the crepes-- merci.

06:00.700 --> 06:03.500
Uh, regarding dinner,
why not just move it up,

06:03.500 --> 06:04.667
do the Hungarian thing

06:04.667 --> 06:06.100
at 5:00?

06:06.100 --> 06:08.000
What do you say?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.333
Well, think it over. Whatever.

06:09.333 --> 06:11.233
I'll be back before 5:00.
I got a meeting.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.100
SHEILA:
Karen? Sweetie?

06:15.100 --> 06:17.066
I'm gonna be there, okay?

06:17.066 --> 06:18.100
I have a session today.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.400
I'm gonna have
a breakthrough,

06:19.400 --> 06:20.600
I can see it.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.633
(scoffing, snickering):
Yeah, come on...

06:23.633 --> 06:25.567
KAREN:
Keep laughing,

06:25.567 --> 06:27.333
and I will slit your throat
while you sleep.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.166
(knocking on door)
I'm coming.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.767
Warren.
Debbie.

06:35.767 --> 06:38.066
Lip upstairs?
Yeah.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.633
FIONA:
Carl, eat.

06:42.633 --> 06:44.133
Don't organize, okay?
After you eat them,

06:44.133 --> 06:45.567
they all end up
in the same place.

06:45.567 --> 06:47.066
Who was at the door?

06:47.066 --> 06:48.567
DEBBIE:
Warren for Lip.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.166
Don't worry about
the ketchup and stuff.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.567
Just the milk and the meat.
STEVE: All right,
enough hot water

06:52.567 --> 06:54.200
for at last one more shower.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.133
Did Carl blow up
the neighborhood again?

06:56.133 --> 06:58.033
No, I forgot to pay the bill.

06:58.033 --> 06:59.166
Hey...
(pats her behind)

06:59.166 --> 07:00.533
happens to the best of us.

07:00.533 --> 07:01.500
Not to me, okay?

07:01.500 --> 07:02.700
I-I'm not like this.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.533
Like what?
Distracted.

07:04.533 --> 07:05.700
Yeah, by what?

07:05.700 --> 07:08.033
Well, you're the only
new thing in the mix.

07:08.033 --> 07:12.033
Wait, am I actually
distracting Fiona Gallagher?

07:12.033 --> 07:13.467
Really!

07:15.000 --> 07:15.767
I... hey...

07:15.767 --> 07:19.233
I will make a coffee run
after I finish.

07:19.233 --> 07:20.400
Fine.
Okay?

07:20.400 --> 07:22.100
Time for school, okay?

07:22.100 --> 07:23.633
Lip! Feet on the floor!

07:23.633 --> 07:24.600
Lip?

07:26.367 --> 07:27.700
(sighs)

07:27.700 --> 07:29.033
Warren.

07:29.033 --> 07:30.166
Where's my paper?

07:30.166 --> 07:31.600
Where's my money?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.300
I got it.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.033
Okay.

07:35.734 --> 07:37.533
I want to see it.

07:37.533 --> 07:39.767
$35, right?

07:39.767 --> 07:41.133
No, $50.

07:41.133 --> 07:42.467
Ching chow choon chow

07:42.467 --> 07:45.133
cho ching wang
hang fo....
Stop speaking

07:45.133 --> 07:46.200
fake Korean, Warren.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.734
I never said $35.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.200
Not for the paper
I wrote you last month,

07:50.200 --> 07:52.033
not for the paper I
wrote you last semester,

07:52.033 --> 07:53.200
not for this one.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.467
All right? It's $50.

07:55.467 --> 07:58.000
Can you do $36?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.200
No.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.467
$38?
(groans):
Oh...

08:01.467 --> 08:03.166
Warren...

08:03.166 --> 08:06.033
once again proving that
Koreans are the Asian Jews.

08:06.033 --> 08:07.433
That's racist.

08:07.433 --> 08:11.066
No. Facts cannot
be racist.

08:11.066 --> 08:12.767
Many Irish are drunks.

08:12.767 --> 08:14.367
Many French smell.

08:14.367 --> 08:16.166
Most Chinese hate children.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.533
That's why they sell
them to Americans.

08:18.533 --> 08:21.400
Now, the fact here

08:21.400 --> 08:24.000
is that you,
the one Korean I know,

08:24.000 --> 08:25.200
made a deal of 50 bucks

08:25.200 --> 08:26.767
for an original essay
about The Great

08:26.767 --> 08:29.300
goddamn Gatsby,  yet...

08:29.300 --> 08:33.000
once again, you're trying
to get me to lower
my agreed-upon price.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.667
Okay? So...

08:34.667 --> 08:36.767
I want you
to give me $50

08:36.767 --> 08:38.333
or GFY.

08:38.333 --> 08:39.767
GFY?

08:39.767 --> 08:42.433
Go Fuck Yourself.

08:50.133 --> 08:52.433
You're short again.
What?

08:52.433 --> 08:53.500
Inventory.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.633
Gone, out the door
without being paid for.

08:55.633 --> 08:57.100
Soup,

08:57.100 --> 08:59.433
beer, chips,
cigarettes, lollipops,

08:59.433 --> 09:01.767
salt-- people are stealing salt,
Kash, what the hell?

09:01.767 --> 09:03.333
Kids, why don't you
go in the back

09:03.333 --> 09:04.333
and get yourself some juice.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.100
Boys, stay right
where you are.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.533
You need to hear this.

09:07.533 --> 09:10.100
Other than genetic markers
for heart disease and bad teeth,

09:10.100 --> 09:12.667
this dump is the sum total
of what we're leaving you.

09:13.734 --> 09:17.033
The shoplifting is out of hand--

09:17.033 --> 09:18.166
$320 in one week.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.333
This is not
a food bank.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.734
What are you doing when all
this thievery is taking place?

09:22.734 --> 09:25.066
You playing Brickbreaker
on your phone?

09:25.066 --> 09:28.433
Do I need to get
the security cameras fixed?

09:28.433 --> 09:31.133
'Cause that's a $2,500 bill
we cannot afford.

09:32.767 --> 09:36.767
Do me a favor while
I take the kids to school--

09:36.767 --> 09:39.133
grow a pair.

09:39.133 --> 09:40.367
Come on, boys.

09:40.367 --> 09:41.533
You guys have
your lunches?

09:43.667 --> 09:45.033
(can crackles)

09:46.233 --> 09:47.567
(turns engine off)

10:00.700 --> 10:03.300
(grunts)

10:03.300 --> 10:05.567
(gasps, pants)
You sure this is it?

10:05.567 --> 10:07.667
Yeah. Can I
please go now?

10:07.667 --> 10:10.467
When the kids leave.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.767
Oh, Liam, we got to get you
onto this potty!

10:12.767 --> 10:15.433
We can take some of the money
that we spent on diapers,

10:15.433 --> 10:17.533
and we can buy you candy,
and cars!

10:17.533 --> 10:19.633
Don't you like
candy and cars?

10:19.633 --> 10:21.700
Ah, rewards for shitting--
the good old days.

10:21.700 --> 10:22.734
Hey, let me help.

10:22.734 --> 10:24.066
Okay, cool.

10:24.066 --> 10:26.066
When Liam starts holding
his breath and squinting,

10:26.066 --> 10:27.100
put him on this.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.500
The power bill.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.667
(sighs)

10:29.667 --> 10:30.734
Come on, I'm
almost living here.

10:30.734 --> 10:31.767
No, you're not.

10:31.767 --> 10:33.333
Lip gave me enough
to pay for it yesterday.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.233
I picked up a last-minute shift
at the motel

10:35.233 --> 10:37.133
and forgot to walk it
to the payment center.

10:37.133 --> 10:38.767
STEVE:
430 bucks?

10:38.767 --> 10:41.100
Lip's a bit flush
this month.
It's S.A.T. season.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.000
He's always flush
during S.A.T. season.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.100
S.A.T.?

10:44.100 --> 10:45.100
College tests.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.333
He tutors?

10:46.333 --> 10:48.734
Uh, no. He takes.

10:48.734 --> 10:51.633
Okay, go play
with your cars.

10:51.633 --> 10:54.300
Oh, hey, I got
another lead for you.
Oh, set it up, douche.

10:54.300 --> 10:55.700
I'm taking it for someone
else after school today,

10:55.700 --> 10:58.433
but, uh, there's another
session in two weeks.

10:58.433 --> 10:59.567
All right.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.100
Don't take the phone today,
okay? I need it.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.166
I need it.
(laughs)
For what?

11:03.166 --> 11:04.467
Cold calling,
for baby-sitting gigs.

11:04.467 --> 11:06.533
I sound more mature
on the phone.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.200
I'm using the phone today, okay?

11:08.200 --> 11:09.500
Everybody go.
You're gonna be late.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.100
STEVE:
I'll give you guys a ride.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.500
Thank you.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.367
Teacher told me to
give this to you.

11:15.367 --> 11:17.367
Wait. What did you do?
Nothing.

11:17.367 --> 11:19.133
This is from last Friday.

11:19.133 --> 11:20.500
It's Wednesday! Carl!

11:20.500 --> 11:22.266
Wait, whoa,
what'd he do?

11:22.266 --> 11:23.633
Nothing.
Hey, bat stays here.

11:25.633 --> 11:28.467
Why do we keep having
this conversation?

11:28.467 --> 11:31.333
Because you never
take the money.

11:31.333 --> 11:33.200
Because I don't need it.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.767
Don't you have
someplace to be?

11:44.767 --> 11:47.433
MAN: Catholics--
look at 'em all.

11:47.433 --> 11:49.567
They replicate
like rabbits.

11:49.567 --> 11:53.000
But, you know, if the Pope
ever approves of condoms,

11:53.000 --> 11:54.567
I'd get baptized.

11:54.567 --> 11:57.533
A lot I like about
the Catholic Mass.

11:58.533 --> 12:00.200
(car door closes)
Good to know.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.667
Let's get this
over with.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.033
(groans)

12:08.533 --> 12:10.600
(door closes)

12:14.533 --> 12:16.600
Who forgot what?

12:17.533 --> 12:20.100
Frank forgot to pay.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.400
Get the fuck out of my house.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.667
You should dead-bolt your door.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.166
This is
a dangerous neighborhood.

12:24.166 --> 12:25.533
Frank doesn't live
here anymore.

12:25.533 --> 12:27.767
Yeah, well, just 'cause
he don't live here anymore,

12:27.767 --> 12:30.133
doesn't mean you don't know
where he lives now.

12:30.133 --> 12:31.400
Put the bat down,

12:31.400 --> 12:32.700
pick up the phone,

12:32.700 --> 12:35.133
and tell him to get us
the six grand he owes.

12:35.133 --> 12:36.200
What?

12:36.200 --> 12:37.567
Or bring back the car.

12:37.567 --> 12:39.300
Or we'll come back
and use the bat on you.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.467
(door closes)

12:46.467 --> 12:47.567
(sighs)

12:47.567 --> 12:49.066
It's a buck-50 up front.

12:49.066 --> 12:52.000
When you get your S.A.T. results
back and see how great Lip did,

12:52.000 --> 12:53.367
it's another buck-50.

12:53.367 --> 12:54.767
And we do this today?

12:54.767 --> 12:57.700
No, today's session
is booked.

12:57.700 --> 12:58.767
Three weeks.

12:58.767 --> 13:02.100
So I sit next to you
while you take the test?

13:02.100 --> 13:03.300
No.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.767
He's pretending to be you.

13:05.767 --> 13:07.433
You can't be there.

13:07.433 --> 13:10.200
Why would they
think you're me?

13:10.200 --> 13:13.266
Well, I'll have a I.D.
that says that I am you.

13:13.266 --> 13:17.500
But what if they
ask me for my I.D.?

13:17.500 --> 13:20.200
I'm going to
make a fake I.D.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.367
But I'm tall.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.600
Yeah. That's-That's a chance
were just going to have to take.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.667
Yeah.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.033
Saturday night.

13:36.033 --> 13:37.533
What time can
I pick you up?

13:37.533 --> 13:38.734
7:00.

13:38.734 --> 13:41.734
Done.
(chuckles)

13:45.333 --> 13:47.100
You're dating Oompa now?

13:47.100 --> 13:48.633
He doesn't talk.
It's fun.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.667
Come in.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.300
(shuddering)

13:56.633 --> 13:58.633
I need a breakthrough,
Malaya.

13:58.633 --> 14:00.500
Parents Night.
Oh, very important.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.200
My daughter Karen.
We've met.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.467
I'm a little geared up.

14:04.467 --> 14:06.400
I understand.
It's good.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.333
Children need to know
their parents care

14:08.333 --> 14:09.734
about their education.

14:09.734 --> 14:12.000
I tell my son,
"Finish eighth grade,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.533
and then we'll talk about
you working in construction."

14:14.533 --> 14:17.333
Not that I couldn't use
the extra paycheck now.

14:17.333 --> 14:19.500
Oh. Right.

14:19.500 --> 14:22.133
(sighing happily):
Okay.

14:22.133 --> 14:24.633
(exhales)

14:37.333 --> 14:38.633
I'm ready.

14:38.633 --> 14:40.133
FIONA:
Jesus, Frank!

14:40.133 --> 14:41.667
Two assholes busted
into our house

14:41.667 --> 14:43.533
looking for you and some car?

14:43.533 --> 14:44.367
Did they follow you here?

14:44.367 --> 14:45.700
Where is it?

14:45.700 --> 14:48.567
I was invited to participate
in a business venture.

14:48.567 --> 14:50.400
What did you do with
the money?
That's just it!

14:50.400 --> 14:53.066
I wasn't given
any money up front!

14:53.066 --> 14:55.300
I was simply promised
that money would be shared

14:55.300 --> 14:58.700
with me once an insurance
claim was... was settled.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.667
Has that promise
been delivered upon?

15:00.667 --> 15:03.433
No. No, it has not.

15:03.433 --> 15:04.533
I warned you, Frank.

15:04.533 --> 15:06.266
You knew about this
and you didn't tell me?

15:06.266 --> 15:07.667
Fi, I don't have
the time to call you

15:07.667 --> 15:08.600
every time Frank
has a bad idea.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.000
I'll talk to them.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.166
Oh, yeah? And say what?
"Hey guys,

15:11.166 --> 15:13.233
sorry I forgot
to light the car on fire."

15:13.233 --> 15:15.333
I was not doing
the igniting.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.734
I was just doing the "park
in a remote location."

15:17.734 --> 15:20.133
Unfortunately, I had
to make a pit stop,

15:20.133 --> 15:22.166
and when I got back,
the car was gone.

15:22.166 --> 15:24.033
You're gonna
take care of this. Now.

15:24.033 --> 15:26.667
Could go to Jersey for a while.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.033
Stay with your
Great Uncle George.

15:28.033 --> 15:29.066
No. You're staying here,

15:29.066 --> 15:30.533
and you're gonna
take care of this car,

15:30.533 --> 15:32.734
'cause you're also gonna
be here to take care of Carl.

15:32.734 --> 15:35.000
He needs you to show up
for him at Parents Night

15:35.000 --> 15:36.100
to discuss
behavioral problems.

15:38.033 --> 15:39.333
(grunting)

15:39.333 --> 15:40.700
(screaming)

15:45.266 --> 15:47.100
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

15:47.100 --> 15:49.400
These sound like
solutions, not problems.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.300
The school disagrees.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.533
He's a boy.

15:52.533 --> 15:54.767
This is what boys do!

15:54.767 --> 15:56.133
When I was growing up,

15:56.133 --> 15:58.033
Joe Palazzo bit off
a kid's finger.

15:58.033 --> 15:59.400
Oh, that's got to be bullshit.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.734
Sister Irmalita

16:00.734 --> 16:03.266
picked up the nub
and wrapped it in Kleenex.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.700
She always kept her snot rag
stuffed in her sleeve.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.266
They're threatening
to expel him.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.367
Well, go talk 'em out of it.

16:09.367 --> 16:11.333
They want a parent.
A real parent.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.033
Oh, I guess you're
off the hook then, Frank.

16:13.033 --> 16:15.166
(men laughing)

16:15.166 --> 16:17.734
I have never been
threatened by teachers,

16:17.734 --> 16:20.500
and I am not going
to start now.

16:20.500 --> 16:24.000
I am fed up with these
pangender hermaphrodites

16:24.000 --> 16:26.767
who hate that human
beings are a species

16:26.767 --> 16:29.200
with two distinct genders.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.100
It's like they've
declared war on testicles!

16:32.100 --> 16:35.633
They want to remove all the
masculinity from the schools,

16:35.633 --> 16:37.500
fill the world
with yogurt-eaters.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.433
Well, do your research!

16:39.433 --> 16:41.600
We're all descendents
of barbarians,

16:41.600 --> 16:43.233
and the sooner we face it,

16:43.233 --> 16:47.100
the sooner we'll have a
civilization worth celebrating.

16:47.100 --> 16:50.367
So, hell no,
I won't go,

16:50.367 --> 16:54.000
'cause no one scares
Frank Gallagher!

16:55.600 --> 16:57.667
(quietly):
Oh, shit.

16:57.667 --> 16:58.767
(clattering)

17:08.300 --> 17:12.033
♪ I feel the power
of the Lord within me ♪

17:14.000 --> 17:18.233
♪ I feel the power
of the Lord inside ♪

17:21.100 --> 17:23.400
♪ And I feel a surge
as He rises up... ♪

17:23.400 --> 17:27.200
♪ ♪

17:38.066 --> 17:39.667
Can you pretend
to be Frank tonight?

17:39.667 --> 17:42.133
Sorry, Fi. I'm working.

17:42.133 --> 17:44.333
Why can't you do it?

17:44.333 --> 17:46.533
Say you had Carl when you
were, like, 14 or something.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.667
You could pass
for 23.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.667
No?
(chuckles)

17:50.667 --> 17:53.367
How 'bout Kenny?

17:53.367 --> 17:56.000
(snoring)
I'm trying to keep Carl
out of a foster home,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.266
not give 'em reason
to put him in one.

17:58.266 --> 18:00.500
Frank will show up for Carl.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.367
I know you think
he won't,

18:02.367 --> 18:03.600
but, deep down,
I think

18:03.600 --> 18:05.433
Frank is capable
of doing the right thing.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.166
VLAD:
Frank!

18:10.166 --> 18:12.033
Kid! Give me the board!
Give me the board!

18:12.033 --> 18:14.200
Hey! (grunting)

18:14.200 --> 18:15.767
Frank! Stop! Frank!
Hey! Gimme it back!

18:15.767 --> 18:17.467
Give me my
skateboard back!

18:20.000 --> 18:21.767
God! Ah, fuck!

18:21.767 --> 18:23.000
My hammy!

18:23.000 --> 18:24.233
(whooping, laughing)

18:24.233 --> 18:26.166
You losers!

18:31.734 --> 18:33.066
I'm ready.

18:33.066 --> 18:34.700
You know what
I'm thinking?

18:34.700 --> 18:36.166
Indian.

18:36.166 --> 18:39.066
So, let's go get

18:39.066 --> 18:40.333
some curry.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.734
Excellent.

18:42.734 --> 18:45.467
MALAYA:
And now, how about

18:45.467 --> 18:47.567
we go find some fresh chicken?

18:47.567 --> 18:50.166
Ooh, yes. A yummy

18:50.166 --> 18:51.500
tikka masala.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.367
MALAYA:
You're doing great,

18:53.367 --> 18:55.033
Sheila.

18:55.033 --> 18:56.133
Thank you.

18:56.133 --> 18:57.734
You know,
I feel terrific.

18:57.734 --> 19:00.367
It's really....
It's really kind of nice

19:00.367 --> 19:02.000
to be out and about.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.734
Do you see
any fellow shoppers?

19:05.734 --> 19:07.266
Oh.

19:07.266 --> 19:09.333
Yes.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.600
Hi.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.567
Good, Sheila.

19:13.567 --> 19:15.400
Good.
Oh...

19:15.400 --> 19:17.467
Oh, that wasn't so bad.

19:17.467 --> 19:18.667
(keys clicking)

19:18.667 --> 19:20.200
Okay, now,

19:20.200 --> 19:22.233
this one's coming
a little bit close.

19:22.233 --> 19:23.467
MALAYA:
Well...

19:23.467 --> 19:25.467
Sometimes when
we're out and about...

19:25.467 --> 19:26.734
Mm-hmm?

19:26.734 --> 19:28.066
...people shop for some
of the same things.

19:28.066 --> 19:30.000
SHEILA:
Uh-huh?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.700
And they enter
our space for a moment.

19:31.700 --> 19:32.667
Yes. That's happening.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.233
Say hello to her.

19:35.233 --> 19:37.000
Hello.

19:39.367 --> 19:40.433
Oh, oh. That wasn't so bad.

19:40.433 --> 19:41.400
(laughs)

19:41.400 --> 19:43.033
That wasn't so bad at all.

19:43.033 --> 19:44.500
She seemed really nice.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.667
Okay.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.633
SHEILA:
Oh... Oh, God. Wait.

19:47.633 --> 19:50.166
Time to check out
and head outside.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.500
SHEILA: No, no, no.
We just started and I...

19:52.500 --> 19:55.066
I still need
vanilla and raisins

19:55.066 --> 19:57.100
and-and peaches.
I need to get some peaches.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.200
No peaches in Indian food.
Yes!

19:59.200 --> 20:00.400
No, there's peaches.
Concentrate.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.100
Oh, God.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.333
Oh!

20:03.333 --> 20:04.633
No, no! No.

20:04.633 --> 20:06.333
I can't do it. I can't.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.533
Stop it! Make it stop!

20:08.533 --> 20:10.433
(sobbing)

20:11.400 --> 20:13.433
No.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.567
Sorry I threw you
out this morning.

20:24.567 --> 20:27.633
I love a woman
that knows what she wants.

20:27.633 --> 20:29.266
(chuckles)
Yeah.

20:29.266 --> 20:30.600
I want to be
someone else today.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.000
How's work?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.600
Backbreaking.

20:35.533 --> 20:37.133
Can I swing by
and take you to lunch?

20:37.133 --> 20:40.400
I love that there's a world
where people go out to lunch.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.567
(alarm wailing)

20:41.567 --> 20:45.133
WOMAN: Next.
Carl's in trouble at school.

20:45.133 --> 20:47.000
Parents Night's tonight
and they want Frank

20:47.000 --> 20:48.500
to show up, and he
says he won't,

20:48.500 --> 20:50.033
so I got to go fix it

20:50.033 --> 20:51.667
before nobody shows up
and he gets bounced.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.066
(alarm continues wailing)
Sounds fun.

20:54.066 --> 20:55.633
I'll text ya later?

20:55.633 --> 20:56.667
Make it dirty.

20:56.667 --> 20:59.166
(alarm stops)

21:03.033 --> 21:04.567
So, are you guys going

21:04.567 --> 21:06.600
to the parent-teacher
conference tonight?

21:06.600 --> 21:07.600
(laughing):
No.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.500
Need a parent for that,
don't you?

21:09.500 --> 21:12.000
Hey, Louise got an "A"
on the paper you wrote

21:12.000 --> 21:13.433
for her English class.

21:13.433 --> 21:14.700
How do you keep doing that?

21:14.700 --> 21:18.300
Well, to master the art
of the book report,

21:18.300 --> 21:20.767
you just take any novel,
no matter when it was written,

21:20.767 --> 21:22.700
and you argue
that the main character

21:22.700 --> 21:24.433
is a latent homosexual.

21:24.433 --> 21:26.500
No, seriously.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.066
Seriously.
Now, most English teachers

21:29.066 --> 21:31.033
are either gay and agree,

21:31.033 --> 21:34.600
or they're straight, but
too scared to disagree

21:34.600 --> 21:35.700
and get labeled
as intolerant.

21:35.700 --> 21:36.734
(laughing)

21:36.734 --> 21:38.767
Hmm.

21:38.767 --> 21:40.467
1870!
All right.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.500
Yeah! Thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.633
Perfect for the Big Ten.
Thanks.

21:43.633 --> 21:44.600
Happy to help, man.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.066
Hey, man.
You more than helped.

21:46.066 --> 21:48.266
Now I'll most definitely
be a beer swillin',

21:48.266 --> 21:50.333
roofie slippin',
fightin' Illini next year.

21:50.333 --> 21:51.600
All right?
All right.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.266
Awesome.

21:53.266 --> 21:54.767
LIP:
What happened, Tire?

21:54.767 --> 21:56.433
Not satisfied with your results?

21:56.433 --> 21:58.000
Haven't come back yet.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.266
Any day now.

21:59.266 --> 22:01.567
I better not
look stupid.

22:01.567 --> 22:02.667
Impossible.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.400
Hey, listen,
there's one last

22:04.400 --> 22:07.700
testing session this year,
so tell your friends.

22:07.700 --> 22:10.333
Don't tell me what to do.

22:15.066 --> 22:17.367
Why do we help
people we hate?

22:17.367 --> 22:19.367
I believe we're
just taking our cue

22:19.367 --> 22:21.200
from American foreign policy.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.533
(chuckles)

22:26.100 --> 22:29.000
(panting)

22:29.000 --> 22:31.100
(grunts)

22:37.266 --> 22:39.233
(knocking at door)

22:39.233 --> 22:41.700
(sobbing):
Hello? Hello?

22:41.700 --> 22:44.767
It's Frank.
Frank?

22:44.767 --> 22:46.767
Come in, Frank.
Yeah.

22:46.767 --> 22:48.767
Okay, good.
I'm fine.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.133
Shoes. Shoes.

22:50.133 --> 22:51.467
Shoes? Yeah.

22:51.467 --> 22:52.767
The bag. The bag.

22:52.767 --> 22:55.266
Hon, you got to lighten up
about the shoes, okay?

22:55.266 --> 22:57.333
I want shoes in bags.

22:57.333 --> 23:00.000
I appreciate you
seeing me.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.133
You're Carl's mother?

23:01.133 --> 23:02.500
Uh, no, sister.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.533
Legal guardian?

23:04.533 --> 23:06.367
Formally, no.

23:06.367 --> 23:08.033
Mr. Monroe?

23:08.033 --> 23:09.567
Where's that papier-mache?

23:09.567 --> 23:11.533
Right here.

23:11.533 --> 23:14.166
The kids have been making
papier-mache sculptures

23:14.166 --> 23:16.767
about what they love
about themselves.

23:16.767 --> 23:21.333
This is Carl's.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.667
What is that?

23:22.667 --> 23:26.300
That is a papier-mache
pile of shit.

23:26.300 --> 23:31.000
Wait. He has a very
developed sense of humor.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
We're not laughing.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.633
Carl's future is speaking
to us through art.

23:35.633 --> 23:37.700
A dark future

23:37.700 --> 23:40.066
filled with what,
even to the untrained eye,

23:40.066 --> 23:41.533
is a budding psychosis.
I...

23:41.533 --> 23:43.166
We need to speak

23:43.166 --> 23:45.200
to his father or his mother.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.700
Well, they're-they're
out of town.

23:47.700 --> 23:50.166
It's important...

23:50.166 --> 23:52.033
I need a parent!
Not a sister.

23:52.033 --> 23:55.266
I've had what seems to be 15
of you goddamn Gallaghers

23:55.266 --> 23:57.600
here at this school, and I
have never once met a parent!

23:57.600 --> 24:01.300
Not once! Who in the hell
is raising this degenerate?

24:01.300 --> 24:03.233
Come back tonight with a parent

24:03.233 --> 24:05.333
or a call will be placed

24:05.333 --> 24:07.700
to a place
you don't want me to call.

24:11.567 --> 24:15.467
Please? I just want someone
to be there for her.

24:15.467 --> 24:19.000
To bear witness to
her achievements.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.767
If it was about Karen,
I would do it.

24:20.767 --> 24:22.600
But these nights
are not about the kids.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.033
They're about the teachers
giving themselves a platform

24:25.033 --> 24:26.233
for you to worship them,

24:26.233 --> 24:28.667
asking you to applaud
with gratitude

24:28.667 --> 24:29.633
for all the worthless crap

24:29.633 --> 24:31.066
they've been
teaching your kids,

24:31.066 --> 24:32.300
while, in reality,

24:32.300 --> 24:34.300
they're asking you
to validate them

24:34.300 --> 24:35.467
for the choice they made

24:35.467 --> 24:37.467
to waste their lives
as educators.

24:37.467 --> 24:40.066
(knocking at door)

24:40.066 --> 24:41.367
Who-Who's that?

24:41.367 --> 24:44.567
I'm expecting some granola
from Oregon.

24:44.567 --> 24:47.467
From... Gran--
From Oregon?

24:47.467 --> 24:49.400
People wonder why oil
prices are so high.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.700
Shipping oats and
sugar all the way...

24:52.700 --> 24:53.667
(knocking)

24:56.467 --> 24:58.600
Oh. Can I help you?

24:58.600 --> 25:01.066
Uh... looking for Frank.

25:01.066 --> 25:02.633
SHEILA:
Oh.

25:02.633 --> 25:05.133
VLAD: It's, uh, it's Tommy and
Joey from down at the bar.

25:05.133 --> 25:07.233
SHEILA: Oh.
We, we got
a darts tournament...

25:07.233 --> 25:09.300
Oh.
...raising money
for paralyzed kids,

25:09.300 --> 25:11.500
and, uh, we need Frank.

25:11.500 --> 25:14.300
We can't win and help the kids
without our star player.

25:14.300 --> 25:18.166
SHEILA:
Well, he's kind of

25:18.166 --> 25:20.233
in an uncooperative
mood today,

25:20.233 --> 25:22.500
but I'll see if
the paralyzed kids

25:22.500 --> 25:24.767
can get him out.

25:27.266 --> 25:29.367
Let's see.

25:33.233 --> 25:35.200
You, uh, you play?

25:35.200 --> 25:36.533
We need women, too.

25:36.533 --> 25:38.200
No, I am not a
darts person.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.200
(both chuckle)

25:39.200 --> 25:40.633
Would you mind,

25:40.633 --> 25:43.400
um, taking
your shoes off?

25:43.400 --> 25:46.700
My, uh, my mother,
God rest her soul,

25:46.700 --> 25:48.133
would be upset
if I didn't.

25:48.133 --> 25:50.066
Mm-hmm.
Lovely house.

25:50.066 --> 25:51.533
Oh, thank you.

25:51.533 --> 25:53.133
So, uh,

25:53.133 --> 25:54.600
where's Frank?

25:54.600 --> 25:56.433
Um, Frank?

25:56.433 --> 25:58.266
Frank?

25:58.266 --> 25:59.667
Frank?

25:59.667 --> 26:01.133
Frank!

26:03.233 --> 26:05.266
Geez.

26:07.200 --> 26:10.200
(talking indistinctly)

26:23.533 --> 26:25.767
(Middle-Eastern music
playing quietly over speakers)

26:44.200 --> 26:47.000
Oh, heads up, man.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.633
You're out of barbecue Pringles.

26:54.433 --> 26:57.100
Hey, did Mickey pay for that?

26:59.700 --> 27:01.700
You have to stand up
to him, Kash.

27:01.700 --> 27:03.500
What the hell was
I supposed to say?

27:03.500 --> 27:05.700
How about "Cut out the shit
or I'll call the cops?"

27:05.700 --> 27:08.467
I tried that once
with his father.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.266
(grunting)
What do I owe you now?!

27:14.734 --> 27:17.467
Mickey's father is
in prison now, all right?

27:17.467 --> 27:19.400
I don't need any new enemies.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.333
What, so you're just going to
let him keep coming in here,

27:21.333 --> 27:22.333
and take what he wants?

27:22.333 --> 27:25.066
It's the cost of
doing business.

27:25.066 --> 27:27.667
(door opens,
bell jingles)

27:35.600 --> 27:37.500
I forgot the dip.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.266
Jesus, Kash.

27:44.066 --> 27:45.467
Hey, Mickey,

27:45.467 --> 27:46.734
why don't you steal
from a neighborhood

27:46.734 --> 27:47.734
you don't live in?

27:47.734 --> 27:49.567
Have some civic
pride, huh?

27:51.467 --> 27:52.333
(door opening)
Hey, hey...

27:52.333 --> 27:55.000
Jesus! Fuck.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.533
You know where I live
if you have a problem.

28:00.033 --> 28:04.233
Here, go to the store and
replace the stuff he stole.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.734
We're cowards.

28:07.734 --> 28:09.667
We're smart men
in a stupid world.

28:09.667 --> 28:12.500
Hurry before Linda gets back
and sees what's missing.

28:33.433 --> 28:35.266
Bathroom break?

28:35.266 --> 28:37.500
You'll need to
be escorted.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.266
Oh, no, thanks, I'm all done.

28:47.133 --> 28:49.533
FIONA: Thanks for
turning us back on.

28:49.533 --> 28:51.600
Sure.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.533
STEVE:
How'd the meeting at school go?

28:55.533 --> 28:56.600
Badly.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.000
They're gonna sic
social services on us

28:58.000 --> 28:59.400
if Frank doesn't show,

28:59.400 --> 29:01.767
since he's never once in his
life shown up at a school event

29:01.767 --> 29:03.767
for any one of us, I'm trying
to figure something else out.

29:03.767 --> 29:05.533
Why don't I come tonight
and pretend to be him?

29:05.533 --> 29:08.066
I'll say, you know, I'll
say whatever people say,

29:08.066 --> 29:10.533
like, you know, I'm
traveling a lot,

29:10.533 --> 29:12.233
and Carl's probably
just acting out

29:12.233 --> 29:13.233
'cause he misses me.

29:13.233 --> 29:15.066
You're way too young.

29:15.066 --> 29:17.133
I thought you were gonna
say "too handsome."

29:17.133 --> 29:19.500
There's other people
I can try.

29:19.500 --> 29:20.533
Yeah, who?

29:20.533 --> 29:22.333
People.

29:22.333 --> 29:24.033
Okay?
I-I'll see you later.

29:24.033 --> 29:26.100
I can't keep burning up
the minutes on my phone.

29:29.133 --> 29:31.700
Hector, you busy tonight?

29:34.033 --> 29:35.700
(sighs)

29:39.166 --> 29:41.367
Hey, Morgan, it's Lip.

29:41.367 --> 29:42.467
Uh, test went well.

29:42.467 --> 29:44.166
No problem with the I.D.--

29:44.166 --> 29:47.166
one of the benefits
of your androgynous name.

29:47.166 --> 29:51.367
I'm thinking I scored you,
like, a 2,200.

29:51.367 --> 29:54.433
So send me that postcard
from Stanford, all right?

29:54.433 --> 29:56.667
Later.

29:56.667 --> 29:58.200
MAN:
Morgan.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.000
Morgan!

30:00.000 --> 30:02.033
Or is it Greg Powers

30:02.033 --> 30:05.266
or Pete O'Brien
or Jammal Jackson?

30:05.266 --> 30:08.066
You taking tests
for girls now, Morgan?

30:08.066 --> 30:09.367
(chuckles)

30:09.367 --> 30:12.100
Yeah, welcome
to your shit show.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.200
I'm an investigator

30:13.200 --> 30:15.467
for the Educational
Evaluation Service.

30:15.467 --> 30:16.500
We're the people
who administer the...

30:16.500 --> 30:18.066
Yeah, I know.
Oh, you do?

30:18.066 --> 30:20.667
So why don't you tell me
how you cheat?

30:20.667 --> 30:22.200
I don't cheat.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.233
Oh... right.

30:23.233 --> 30:24.333
I don't.

30:24.333 --> 30:26.033
Uh-huh, let's see,
you got a 2,360,

30:26.033 --> 30:30.700
2,290, 2,400, and all
from this crappy high school?

30:30.700 --> 30:32.467
Yeah, I know my shit.

30:32.467 --> 30:34.467
And I got a brand-new test
we just finished creating,

30:34.467 --> 30:37.233
so why don't we go see
if you know your shit

30:37.233 --> 30:39.433
or you're just
full of it?

30:45.633 --> 30:47.633
FRANK:
Karen.

30:47.633 --> 30:50.233
Here.

30:50.233 --> 30:53.633
Daddy Frank, what
are you doing?

30:53.633 --> 30:56.233
Freezing my gonads
off, that's what.

30:56.233 --> 30:59.233
You see that pickup with the
two scary-looking dudes in it?

31:00.567 --> 31:02.667
Yes.
Divert
their attention

31:02.667 --> 31:05.533
so I can slip back
into the house.

31:05.533 --> 31:07.200
Daddy Frank,

31:07.200 --> 31:11.200
I really, really want you to
come to Parents Night tonight.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.166
Nobody's ever there to see
how great I'm doing,

31:13.166 --> 31:15.133
and I'm really,
really doing great.

31:17.266 --> 31:19.667
Distract them and we'll talk.

31:19.667 --> 31:22.533
Promise me you'll come to school
for me tonight and I'll do it.

31:22.533 --> 31:25.000
All right, all right!
Jesus!

31:25.000 --> 31:27.300
Everything's gotta be
quid pro fucking quo.

31:27.300 --> 31:30.266
Go, distract,
distract.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.400
So, what have you allowed
to be stolen today?

31:43.400 --> 31:44.700
Can we try some optimism?

31:44.700 --> 31:45.633
Optimism

31:45.633 --> 31:47.633
is for children and presidents,

31:47.633 --> 31:52.400
not for mini-mart owners
in a land of 30 million jobless.

31:52.400 --> 31:55.300
Where the hell
were you?

31:55.300 --> 31:57.433
Uh...
Why are you
looking at him?

31:57.433 --> 31:59.000
Where are you going
with all that stuff?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.767
Nowhere, I...

32:02.133 --> 32:04.033
Who?

32:04.033 --> 32:06.100
Is it the Milkovich kid
again?

32:07.467 --> 32:10.033
(both sigh)

32:17.100 --> 32:18.567
That's it.

32:18.567 --> 32:20.033
We're closed.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.467
Follow me.

32:32.767 --> 32:35.734
SHEILA: I cannot thank you
enough for representing

32:35.734 --> 32:37.633
our family tonight
at Parents Night.

32:37.633 --> 32:39.600
Karen is going
to be so happy.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.066
(sighs)

32:41.066 --> 32:43.000
And make sure you ask
lots of questions

32:43.000 --> 32:44.467
and then report
back to me.

32:44.467 --> 32:46.433
I need details,
lots of details.

32:46.433 --> 32:48.700
Okay?
Details, details,
yeah, yeah, lots

32:48.700 --> 32:50.633
of details.

32:50.633 --> 32:52.533
I'd stay down here
and entertain you

32:52.533 --> 32:54.767
with my lips.

32:55.667 --> 32:58.633
But it's getting kind of late.

32:58.633 --> 33:01.734
No, those, those things
never start on time.

33:01.734 --> 33:04.233
You sure?
Yeah, pretty sure.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.633
They never--
we've got time.

33:06.633 --> 33:07.700
Positive?

33:07.700 --> 33:09.333
We've got time, we've got time.
Okay.

33:09.333 --> 33:10.200
(unzipping)

33:11.333 --> 33:13.200
Come here.

33:16.033 --> 33:19.066
Well, you missed one.

33:19.066 --> 33:20.767
No, I didn't.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.633
The wording
is ambiguous.

33:27.633 --> 33:30.133
You're gonna get
mail on that.

33:35.333 --> 33:37.233
Huh.

33:37.233 --> 33:39.100
I'll take it up
with the board.

33:43.266 --> 33:45.233
Hm.

33:45.233 --> 33:48.600
2,400.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.033
You know how rare
that is, hmm?

33:50.033 --> 33:51.600
Out of a million
and a half kids

33:51.600 --> 33:52.600
who take the
test every year,

33:52.600 --> 33:55.033
only 300 get a
perfect score.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.467
How'd you catch me?

33:59.467 --> 34:01.367
Huh, well,
as smart as you are,

34:01.367 --> 34:03.433
we got people working
for us who are even smarter.

34:09.467 --> 34:11.333
So what now?

34:11.333 --> 34:14.700
Well, punishment or
redemption-- your choice.

34:14.700 --> 34:17.133
What's the punishment?

34:17.133 --> 34:18.400
You mean, you
entered into this

34:18.400 --> 34:19.533
without researching
the consequences

34:19.533 --> 34:21.133
of getting caught?

34:21.133 --> 34:23.233
What, jail?

34:23.233 --> 34:25.266
(chuckles) No, we're not
usually in the business

34:25.266 --> 34:26.533
of sending kids to jail.

34:26.533 --> 34:30.533
Our only mandate is to send
universities valid scores,

34:30.533 --> 34:33.233
and we invalidate the ones
that aren't legitimate.

34:33.233 --> 34:36.200
I'm at the
University of Chicago.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.567
Come to my office.

34:41.467 --> 34:44.266
And don't you
ever, ever

34:44.266 --> 34:46.734
take a test for
someone else again

34:46.734 --> 34:50.400
or I will find you and I
will beat you senseless.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.333
Hmm?

35:00.200 --> 35:03.066
(whistling
cheerfully)

35:11.567 --> 35:13.533
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

35:13.533 --> 35:16.467
I lived a lot of years
before I met you.

35:16.467 --> 35:17.567
Come on.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.700
Now hold it like you want
to do something with it.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.133
Hand it here.
What?

35:40.700 --> 35:43.567
Left shoulder.

35:43.567 --> 35:44.734
Right shoulder.

35:44.734 --> 35:45.767
Left leg.

35:45.767 --> 35:47.200
Right leg.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.467
Stomach.

35:48.467 --> 35:50.100
Neck... Face.

35:50.467 --> 35:52.100
Heart.

35:56.066 --> 35:58.467
ROTC.

36:05.166 --> 36:07.600
LIP:
Hey, sorry I'm late.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.633
It's okay;
I brought you a shirt.

36:08.633 --> 36:10.266
Okay.
Okay, now, listen up.

36:10.266 --> 36:12.166
We are going to stand united
and show them

36:12.166 --> 36:13.500
that we are a family
that is thriving.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.467
You got it?
Yep.

36:14.467 --> 36:15.500
Let's go.
All right.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.767
Come on.

36:16.767 --> 36:18.233
Come on.

36:20.367 --> 36:22.367
This is it?

36:22.367 --> 36:24.467
This is his brother.

36:24.467 --> 36:26.000
Uh, Phillip.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.367
Very good to see you
again, sir.

36:27.367 --> 36:31.033
Uh, Phillip is 17, I'm 21, uh,

36:31.033 --> 36:33.433
and while we may not be the
legal guardians of our brother,

36:33.433 --> 36:34.433
we do supply him...

36:34.433 --> 36:37.700
I told you I wanted
to see a parent.

36:37.700 --> 36:40.367
We just opened the letter today.

36:40.367 --> 36:43.033
I gave Carl
the letter last week.

36:43.033 --> 36:44.367
LIP:
So you're relying

36:44.367 --> 36:47.000
on a nine-year-old to deliver
important correspondence?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.767
You don't seem
to have a home phone.

36:49.767 --> 36:52.200
FIONA: Carl is taken care of
at home by loving siblings

36:52.200 --> 36:55.333
This is not up
for negotiation.

36:55.333 --> 36:58.266
Your brother is on the verge
of being expelled,

36:58.266 --> 37:01.767
and unfortunately, there are
steps the state requires

37:01.767 --> 37:05.300
to be taken
before he can be bounced,

37:05.300 --> 37:08.667
and a meeting with his
legal guardian is the next step.

37:08.667 --> 37:10.400
Please, you can't do this.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.100
I mean, he loves school.

37:12.100 --> 37:15.433
(scoffs)
More potential victims
here, I suppose.

37:15.433 --> 37:17.767
No, all his
friends are here.

37:17.767 --> 37:19.633
Can you stop it?
I'm serious.

37:19.633 --> 37:21.400
He needs more
structure, we know.

37:21.400 --> 37:25.333
(laughing)

37:25.333 --> 37:28.367
What Carl needs
is medication,

37:28.367 --> 37:33.367
a near-death experience,
or a lobotomy.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.166
You should be very proud
of your daughter.

37:37.166 --> 37:40.300
She's prompt,
poised, cheerful.

37:40.300 --> 37:43.166
Vivid imagination,
expansive vocabulary.

37:43.166 --> 37:45.367
Karen has greatness
in her future.

37:45.367 --> 37:47.400
She gets it from me.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.133
It's all the time

37:49.133 --> 37:51.433
I spent with her
when she was a youngster.

37:51.433 --> 37:53.200
Flash cards and the like.

37:53.200 --> 37:57.233
Pounding, pounding, pounding
relentlessly.

37:57.233 --> 38:01.066
Never underestimate the power
of flash cards.

38:01.066 --> 38:03.166
I'm sorry.

38:03.166 --> 38:05.567
I'm placing a call
to social services.

38:05.567 --> 38:09.100
A home without
a legal guardian

38:09.100 --> 38:12.000
is a home we
cannot condone.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.567
(footsteps approaching)

38:13.567 --> 38:15.500
Hello all.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.533
Uh, sorry I was late.

38:17.533 --> 38:19.200
I got held up
at the office.

38:19.200 --> 38:23.200
So, now that Fiona
and I are engaged, I've filed

38:23.200 --> 38:24.600
the paperwork so
that we can become

38:24.600 --> 38:26.066
the legal guardians
of the children.

38:26.066 --> 38:31.600
Do you realize Carl's
report card has seven U's?

38:31.600 --> 38:33.767
Uh, U's?

38:33.767 --> 38:36.166
As in unsatisfactory.

38:36.166 --> 38:40.200
But don't think of U
as in unsatisfactory.

38:40.200 --> 38:43.533
Think of U as in F.

38:43.533 --> 38:45.734
As in failed?

38:45.734 --> 38:47.200
As in fucked.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.600
I am not a
religious man,

38:50.600 --> 38:53.433
but every now and then,
a child comes along

38:53.433 --> 38:57.133
who makes me believe
in the existence of Satan.

38:57.133 --> 38:59.066
Now, something drastic

38:59.066 --> 39:02.433
must be done, or he's going
to slip down through the cracks,

39:02.433 --> 39:05.133
right up into a clock tower
with a sniper rifle.

39:05.133 --> 39:08.467
DEVELIN: Given our
resources, he is

39:08.467 --> 39:10.033
beyond our ability
to help.

39:10.033 --> 39:11.667
FIONA:
It's just a phase.

39:11.667 --> 39:13.567
And... now that
we're aware of it...

39:13.567 --> 39:15.333
Too late!

39:15.333 --> 39:18.300
This Norman Rockwell display
might warm the cockles

39:18.300 --> 39:20.767
of some other fool who
believes no fucking child--

39:20.767 --> 39:22.767
not even the
budding psychotics--

39:22.767 --> 39:25.600
should be left behind--
but the fact is,

39:25.600 --> 39:28.000
the sooner
Carl is put in prison,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.100
the safer
this world is gonna be.

39:30.100 --> 39:33.000
More of a Mickey Hart fan
when it comes to paintings?

39:33.000 --> 39:34.367
What? What's that?

39:34.367 --> 39:37.300
More of a Mickey Hart fan
than a Norman Rockwell fan.

39:40.166 --> 39:43.200
Mickey Hart's an
all right painter

39:43.200 --> 39:44.533
for a drummer.

39:44.533 --> 39:48.200
Could you all excuse us
for a second?

39:48.200 --> 39:49.400
For what?

39:49.400 --> 39:51.166
If we could just take a walk

39:51.166 --> 39:52.300
and talk in private?

39:52.300 --> 39:54.066
Get a breath of fresh air?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.433
Evening, Frank.

40:15.400 --> 40:16.700
Hey... ooh!

40:16.700 --> 40:18.166
(groaning)

40:18.166 --> 40:21.166
All you had to do is drive
the car and park it.

40:21.166 --> 40:23.000
It was an extraordinary
circumstance.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.567
It was the night the Bears
were playing Green Bay.

40:25.567 --> 40:26.700
There was an after...

40:26.700 --> 40:28.467
(Frank groans)

40:28.467 --> 40:29.633
I'd be kicking you

40:29.633 --> 40:32.100
had I not pulled a
hamstring chasing after you.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.734
You're a fast little bastard.

40:33.734 --> 40:35.767
Second team all-state
in the mile.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.033
(laughs)

40:37.033 --> 40:38.400
(yelling)

40:38.400 --> 40:40.300
Daddy Frank?

40:40.300 --> 40:41.433
VLAD:
Hey.

40:46.233 --> 40:47.433
Sell a kidney,
prostitute your 12-year-old,

40:47.433 --> 40:50.200
I don't care how
you get the money, but I want

40:50.200 --> 40:51.433
six grand in cash
by Saturday,

40:51.433 --> 40:53.700
or this ear will be hanging
around my neck.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.166
(flutters tongue)

41:04.600 --> 41:08.166
No one around
here really knows

41:08.166 --> 41:11.000
those terrapins are a
Grateful Dead thing.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.066
(laughs)

41:12.066 --> 41:14.233
The kids call 'em
Mr. G's turtles.

41:14.233 --> 41:16.567
Shit, man, they
don't even know

41:16.567 --> 41:19.533
who the Grateful Dead are.

41:19.533 --> 41:21.500
Ah, man.

41:21.500 --> 41:25.000
The summer of 1979.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.467
The best summer of my life.

41:27.467 --> 41:30.200
Followed the Dead
around the Midwest.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.734
Supported myself
selling grilled cheese

41:32.734 --> 41:35.066
in the parking lot.

41:35.066 --> 41:36.767
Yeah, they made great music.

41:36.767 --> 41:40.066
Their music blows.

41:40.066 --> 41:42.000
But their female fans...

41:44.066 --> 41:46.500
...were a bunch
of patchouli-soaked sluts

41:46.500 --> 41:49.100
who all wanted
to ball their first black guy.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.166
(both snickering)

41:52.734 --> 41:55.500
I never embraced tokenism
with more gusto.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.300
(laughing)

42:00.767 --> 42:03.433
Those terrapins

42:03.433 --> 42:05.533
were a parting gift

42:05.533 --> 42:07.500
from this Skidmore chick...

42:10.033 --> 42:12.367
...who sucked me off

42:12.367 --> 42:15.767
like I had diamonds buried
in the bottom of my ball sack.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.633
Whoo!

42:19.500 --> 42:24.133
Man... this is
some good shit.

42:24.133 --> 42:26.533
You know, we're gonna
turn Carl around.

42:26.533 --> 42:29.667
Thanks for the joint...

42:29.667 --> 42:32.133
but I'm not gonna lose
my pension

42:32.133 --> 42:35.400
over some little whack job
going postal on my watch.

42:35.400 --> 42:36.700
Though I do not distribute

42:36.700 --> 42:39.300
high-quality medicine
such as this,

42:39.300 --> 42:42.333
I could hook you up
with some discreet people

42:42.333 --> 42:45.166
who'd give you
a favorable price.

42:45.166 --> 42:47.600
We talking a teacher discount?

42:49.333 --> 42:51.000
(laughs)

42:51.000 --> 42:52.467
My man.

42:54.433 --> 42:57.300
What the hell did you do?

42:57.300 --> 42:58.734
Saw an opening,
made my move.

42:58.734 --> 43:00.734
Got lucky.
(laughing)

43:02.367 --> 43:03.667
Daddy!

43:03.667 --> 43:05.200
If I hadn't had such a...

43:05.200 --> 43:07.166
Debbie, we got to go.

43:07.166 --> 43:09.000
I want to say hi
to Daddy. Daddy!

43:09.000 --> 43:10.300
Hi!

43:10.300 --> 43:12.033
Hello, pumpkin!

43:12.033 --> 43:13.266
Karen, what's
going on?

43:13.266 --> 43:15.467
Well, you said you never come
to these, so, I thought that

43:15.467 --> 43:18.200
you weren't gonna come,
and so, I asked Frank

43:18.200 --> 43:19.767
to stand in
for my worthless father.

43:19.767 --> 43:21.333
Did they expel Carl?

43:25.033 --> 43:26.300
What I tell you?

43:26.300 --> 43:29.600
Drama and threats
all for naught.

43:29.600 --> 43:31.567
(laughing)

43:35.133 --> 43:37.033
Come on, guys.

43:37.033 --> 43:38.166
Let's go.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.100
Bye, Daddy.

43:43.100 --> 43:45.467
Yeah. See you.

43:54.133 --> 43:55.367
FIONA:
Carl, we're serious.

43:55.367 --> 43:57.467
The stakes are really,
really high.

43:57.467 --> 44:00.233
We love you, and we need you
in this family.

44:00.233 --> 44:02.333
In this house.

44:02.333 --> 44:04.033
You need to stop biting

44:04.033 --> 44:06.000
and punching
and hurting people.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.333
Well, how else
do I make them cry?

44:09.333 --> 44:10.500
Gossip and slander.

44:10.500 --> 44:12.367
You know,
when I get really angry,

44:12.367 --> 44:14.033
I usually just
count to ten.

44:14.033 --> 44:16.233
Hey, little man,
tell you what we're gonna do.

44:16.233 --> 44:18.400
We're gonna get you some
pads and some skates.

44:18.400 --> 44:19.600
Get you out on the ice.

44:19.600 --> 44:22.066
You can take your frustrations
out with a hockey stick.

44:22.066 --> 44:23.633
Yeah. You can come
to karate with me.

44:23.633 --> 44:24.734
Remember when I broke

44:24.734 --> 44:26.567
Kyle Boozlee's leg?
It took three pins

44:26.567 --> 44:28.200
to put it back
together, huh?

44:28.200 --> 44:30.500
You can't beat karate
when it comes to regulated,

44:30.500 --> 44:31.767
sanctioned violence
for children.

44:37.333 --> 44:42.166
Will you tell me one more time
what the teacher said, Frank?

44:42.166 --> 44:44.500
How many more times?

44:44.500 --> 44:46.500
Mm...

44:46.500 --> 44:49.367
Just one more time.

44:49.367 --> 44:50.633
Just one
more time.

44:50.633 --> 44:53.367
I... I would've known
if I'd been there,

44:53.367 --> 44:54.400
but-but just one more.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.033
They said

44:56.033 --> 45:00.633
she was developing into an
incredibly poised young woman.

45:00.633 --> 45:03.000
Poised?

45:03.000 --> 45:04.700
Mm-hmm.

45:04.700 --> 45:06.500
Oh.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.567
She is.

45:11.233 --> 45:13.734
She is quite the young lady.

45:17.667 --> 45:19.400
(gently patting Frank's hand)

45:21.767 --> 45:23.667
Frank, how...

45:25.367 --> 45:27.667
how am I gonna help her

45:27.667 --> 45:30.100
be the woman she's
supposed to be

45:30.100 --> 45:32.400
if I'm locked up
in this house?

45:34.467 --> 45:36.633
I can't even get
through the doors

45:36.633 --> 45:39.266
of a pretend supermarket.

45:40.667 --> 45:43.066
How am I gonna show her the...

45:43.066 --> 45:44.734
Grand Canyon?

45:47.700 --> 45:49.667
Life is going on

45:49.667 --> 45:53.066
all around me, and
I'm missing out.

45:53.066 --> 45:55.000
(sniffles)

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
(crying):
Why am I so pathetic?

45:58.000 --> 45:59.734
Hey.

45:59.734 --> 46:04.200
You are going to get through
those doors any day now,

46:04.200 --> 46:06.367
and never look back.

46:07.433 --> 46:08.667
Oh!

46:08.667 --> 46:11.000
(laughs)

46:11.000 --> 46:12.533
Frank.

46:12.533 --> 46:14.033
(sniffles)

46:14.033 --> 46:16.300
Frank.

46:16.300 --> 46:17.533
(sniffles)

46:17.533 --> 46:21.700
Thank you for
being my light.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.066
(sniffles)

46:26.066 --> 46:27.734
(sighs)

46:27.734 --> 46:29.467
My Frank.

46:29.467 --> 46:31.200
My light.

46:34.567 --> 46:37.266
(TV playing)
LIP:
Hey.

46:37.266 --> 46:41.333
Um... listen, Morgan,
it's-it's Lip.

46:41.333 --> 46:45.000
Uh... we got to talk.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.767
I-I got some bad news

46:46.767 --> 46:50.734
regarding your S.A.T. scores.

46:50.734 --> 46:54.467
They're invalidating your score.

46:54.467 --> 46:57.133
Um...

46:57.133 --> 46:59.233
I'll go into more detail

46:59.233 --> 47:01.266
when I speak with you.

47:01.266 --> 47:03.300
Sorry to leave this
on your phone.

47:03.300 --> 47:05.200
(dramatic music
plays on TV)

47:05.200 --> 47:06.300
(sighs)

47:06.300 --> 47:08.633
All right. Um... okay.

47:08.633 --> 47:10.333
Hit me back.

47:15.066 --> 47:18.233
(TV continues playing)

47:18.233 --> 47:20.567
Yeah, I didn't
need your help.

47:20.567 --> 47:24.367
No, it looked
like you did.

47:24.367 --> 47:26.767
You're upset that
I actually did help.

47:26.767 --> 47:29.467
You're afraid that
if I keep on showing up

47:29.467 --> 47:31.500
and actually helping,
that you'll like it.

47:31.500 --> 47:32.734
And liking it will lead

47:32.734 --> 47:35.200
to relying on it,
and by relying on it,

47:35.200 --> 47:38.000
you'll be less of the you
you've made yourself into--

47:38.000 --> 47:41.734
a kick-ass you that you
like and I like, too.

47:41.734 --> 47:43.633
But you're afraid that
if you learn to rely on me,

47:43.633 --> 47:46.000
then one day, when you really
need me to show up, I won't.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.633
And then you'll be
angry at yourself

47:47.633 --> 47:50.233
for believing in something
you've only seen in the movies,

47:50.233 --> 47:52.433
something that I'm determined
to prove to you actually exists.

47:52.433 --> 47:55.367
(turning up volume of music)

47:55.367 --> 47:58.333
How come every time
I want to fool around,

47:58.333 --> 48:01.000
you can't shut up?

48:10.133 --> 48:12.033
(weapons firing)

48:12.033 --> 48:14.066
(knocking on door)

48:15.433 --> 48:17.033
(knocking continues)

48:24.333 --> 48:26.367
TIRE NECK:
Hey.

48:26.367 --> 48:27.500
I'm here for Lip

48:27.500 --> 48:29.700
to pay him the balance
for the S.A.T. test?

48:33.700 --> 48:35.767
Tire.

48:35.767 --> 48:38.133
Lip, my man.

48:38.133 --> 48:41.166
They invalidated
my score!
Shit! I was gonna call you.

48:41.166 --> 48:42.300
I'm gonna get, like, a six
on this test!

48:42.300 --> 48:44.100
You get at least
a couple hundred for spelling

48:44.100 --> 48:45.500
your name correctly.
Shit! Wait! Wait! Wait!

48:45.500 --> 48:47.200
I can fix this,
all right?

48:49.133 --> 48:50.667
I won't be able
to play ball in college!

48:50.667 --> 48:51.734
Fuck, you'll go
straight to the pros!

49:03.700 --> 49:05.367
Please...

49:05.367 --> 49:07.433
You think you'll live if I drop
you on your head? I don't.

49:07.433 --> 49:08.433
Lip!

49:08.433 --> 49:10.433
Shit!

49:10.433 --> 49:11.433
Shit!

49:11.433 --> 49:12.200
Get him back inside!

49:12.200 --> 49:13.700
Back off,

49:13.700 --> 49:16.667
or I'll throw
you out, too.
Let him go!

49:16.667 --> 49:18.033
Get my brother
back in the house,

49:18.033 --> 49:19.066
or the kid swings the bat.

49:19.066 --> 49:20.367
Okay, okay.
Now!

49:20.367 --> 49:22.500
Keep your shit straight;
I'll pull him in.

49:22.500 --> 49:23.500
IAN: Hey, now!
Come on!

49:23.500 --> 49:24.567
What the hell
is going on?

49:24.567 --> 49:25.600
Carl's got
it covered.

49:25.600 --> 49:27.734
(panting)

49:27.734 --> 49:30.266
I was just joking.

49:30.266 --> 49:32.100
Okay?

49:32.100 --> 49:33.100
Okay?
