00:09.310 --> 00:12.111
That's the untraceable
question, but what is love?

00:14.315 --> 00:18.350
Hmm. Mm. Mm.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.754
Um...

00:21.756 --> 00:26.091
People have tried to define
that for the longest time.

00:28.562 --> 00:33.065
Love is when you can
look in each other's eyes

00:33.067 --> 00:38.337
and just know they're...
she's gonna be there for you.

00:38.339 --> 00:41.640
It's that sense of excitement

00:41.642 --> 00:44.443
and... Adventure.

00:44.445 --> 00:47.146
It's that feeling of
I can't live without her.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.614
Don't want to live without her.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.050
You want to be with someone,

00:51.052 --> 00:53.752
take care of someone.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.821
Be close with someone.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.524
Caring for somebody
and their well-being

00:58.526 --> 01:00.292
more than you care
for your own.

01:00.294 --> 01:03.762
Finding someone you
can be compatible with

01:03.764 --> 01:05.497
and be committed to.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.853
Each year,
thousands of foreign women

01:27.855 --> 01:29.555
marry American men

01:29.557 --> 01:31.190
through so-called
international matchmakers.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.225
A view from the room.

01:33.227 --> 01:36.095
Come on, people, work with me.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.729
One of the most important
things you'll ever do

01:37.731 --> 01:39.231
is try to find that one person

01:39.233 --> 01:40.432
you want to spend the
rest of your life with.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.568
The international
matchmaking industry,

01:42.570 --> 01:45.571
better known as
mail order bride business,

01:45.573 --> 01:46.805
is booming.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.741
Many of the men
that call me will tell me

01:49.743 --> 01:51.610
it's difficult
to find women here

01:51.612 --> 01:54.246
in the United States
that are even interested

01:54.248 --> 01:57.316
in long-term relationships
and marriage.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.550
There are so many

01:58.552 --> 02:01.353
really sincere, wonderful,
wonderful women

02:01.355 --> 02:04.323
in Russia, Ukraine,
China, everywhere,

02:04.325 --> 02:06.225
who really want
to find somebody

02:06.227 --> 02:07.693
to build family with.

02:07.695 --> 02:10.496
Most of our clients,
they're not willing to settle,

02:10.497 --> 02:11.830
so wy not look
for that life mate

02:11.832 --> 02:13.465
in a different country?

02:13.467 --> 02:16.168
There's a misconception
that these relationships

02:16.170 --> 02:18.670
are set up to give
the men the upper hand.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.205
I am upper hand.

02:20.207 --> 02:22.474
You're the upper hand
in this relationship?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.877
- Are we ready to go?
- We're ready. Let's do it.

02:24.879 --> 02:27.346
You and me, babe.

02:27.348 --> 02:31.483
How often does reality
really meet expectation?

02:31.485 --> 02:32.751
Oh, quite often,

02:32.753 --> 02:35.721
but it doesn't always
happen right away.

02:35.723 --> 02:39.391
And welcome to
"a foreign affair live."

02:39.393 --> 02:41.627
My name is John Adams,

02:41.629 --> 02:43.562
co-founder of a foreign affair.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.832
And I will be your guide
as we explore

02:46.834 --> 02:49.935
the beautiful world of
international introductions.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.840
I've always heard about
mail order brides.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.576
Originally, a guy
would order a wife

02:57.578 --> 02:59.845
with no idea,
maybe a picture of her.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.947
But with the advent
of the Internet,

03:01.949 --> 03:06.485
now it made things much
more visual and real

03:06.487 --> 03:09.388
to see the girls,
to write 'em emails.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.624
My name's Robert Wilson,

03:12.626 --> 03:14.726
I'm from Fresno, California,

03:14.728 --> 03:16.862
work in
heavy steel construction...

03:16.864 --> 03:20.332
roads, Bridges, freeways.

03:20.334 --> 03:24.503
Since my divorce,
it hasn't been great.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.506
It's tough out there.

03:27.508 --> 03:30.342
You know, when you have
a full-time job,

03:30.344 --> 03:32.311
it's tough to meet people,

03:32.313 --> 03:34.680
and I want to meet a woman.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.315
One woman.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.884
That's all I'm looking for
is one woman.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.852
Meeting someone from overseas...

03:40.854 --> 03:44.523
I feel like if I can
meet the right one

03:44.525 --> 03:46.425
that she might be more serious

03:46.427 --> 03:48.794
about actually
building a relationship

03:48.796 --> 03:51.563
and giving it the time
we would need.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.498
My name is Eric ireton.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.867
I'm a mechanical engineer.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.703
I live in San Antonio, Texas.

03:57.705 --> 03:58.904
I'm 45.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.839
What's your favorite gun?

04:00.841 --> 04:02.674
Do you have it in there?

04:02.676 --> 04:04.409
Favorite gun?

04:04.411 --> 04:05.877
I don't know. It's hard
to have a favorite.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.547
.357 Magnum.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.515
The first handgun I bought.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.784
Got my 12-gauge shotgun.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.621
Ak-47, ar-15.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.356
A little .22 caliber

04:17.358 --> 04:19.825
with a 20-gauge shotgun
over/under.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.795
When was your last
serious relationship,

04:23.797 --> 04:26.531
like, here?

04:26.533 --> 04:28.300
I've never had one.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.805
I tried the army and a few of
these other regular dating sites.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.574
Never worked for me.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.810
My name's Bobby Cannon. I'm 46.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.345
And I work in human resources

04:40.347 --> 04:41.680
for the federal government.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.548
And my views are mine alone,

04:43.550 --> 04:44.750
not the government's.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.953
So this is the living room.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.855
This is where I spend
most of the day

04:49.857 --> 04:50.956
when I'm at home.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.393
I've got some of my collection.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.895
I tend to be a little bit shy,

04:56.897 --> 04:58.930
so I don't meet a lot of folks

04:58.932 --> 05:01.933
for relationship purposes.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.303
And to be honest, you know,

05:04.305 --> 05:07.539
I'm a little bit heavier,

05:07.541 --> 05:10.542
so that is something
that is a real negative

05:10.544 --> 05:13.045
in the United States.

05:13.047 --> 05:14.613
I hated dating.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.481
I got on your popular sites,

05:16.483 --> 05:19.084
and my first five dates

05:19.086 --> 05:21.987
lasted less than five minutes.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.822
All five of 'em.

05:23.824 --> 05:28.760
I'm Ron Kirby. I'm from
north Carolina at pinehurst.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.429
I married
my childhood sweetheart.

05:30.431 --> 05:33.432
Met her when she was 12.
I was 13.

05:33.434 --> 05:37.502
Got married at 18.
Three kids by 26.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.104
We were married for 28 years.

05:39.106 --> 05:42.874
If there was one thing
missing in our marriage,

05:42.876 --> 05:44.009
it was this:

05:44.011 --> 05:47.412
I felt taken advantage of.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.381
What I wanted from my wife

05:49.383 --> 05:50.749
was a pat on the back
now and then,

05:50.751 --> 05:53.552
an "attaboy, I'm proud of you."

05:53.554 --> 05:55.821
Just not being
taken for granted.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.723
I do want to be married,

05:57.725 --> 05:59.825
so I got to looking
on the Internet.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.561
And of course, you know, you can
find anything on the Internet.

06:02.563 --> 06:06.031
My name's Travis needham
from plain, Wisconsin.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.533
38 years old.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.536
So how many cows
are you going to milk today?

06:11.538 --> 06:14.573
About 170, 175.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.375
I don't know the exact number.

06:17.945 --> 06:21.813
I know it's a lot more
than I want to milk.

06:26.019 --> 06:30.155
I haven't really
dated a lot of girls,

06:30.157 --> 06:32.457
other than one, and...

06:33.694 --> 06:35.994
Let's just leave it at that.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.998
Where are all the women
in this town?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.733
There's a lot of guys.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.603
I could think of six single
women off the top of my head,

06:44.605 --> 06:47.439
and probably most
are divorcees.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.774
Around here, work ethic.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.108
You don't got time.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.544
I wouldn't take it
as a personal thing.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.513
It's just there's not
a lot of women here.

06:54.515 --> 06:58.683
It's almost like living
with the eskimos, you know?

07:01.121 --> 07:03.889
I got frustrated
with American women,

07:03.891 --> 07:06.992
so I typed into Google
something about Russian brides.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.960
A foreign affair came up.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.029
Welcome to
the fascinating world

07:11.031 --> 07:12.164
of a foreign affair,

07:12.166 --> 07:14.866
where true love
knows no boundaries.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.168
My name is John Adams,

07:16.170 --> 07:18.003
president of a foreign affair,

07:18.005 --> 07:20.572
and I would like to thank you
for taking the time

07:20.574 --> 07:22.073
to learn more
about this exciting

07:22.075 --> 07:23.809
and very real process

07:23.811 --> 07:26.778
of finding
your special someone.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.880
You look at John Adams...

07:28.882 --> 07:30.682
and John, if you're
looking at this,

07:30.684 --> 07:31.850
don't get mad at me...

07:31.852 --> 07:33.685
but he's an average guy.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.720
He isn't the best-looking
guy in the world.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.889
He's a got a little bit
of a pooch, like he said.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.559
And yet it worked for him.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.129
I was lucky enough
to find my Russian bride

07:44.131 --> 07:45.664
several years ago

07:45.666 --> 07:47.599
with the assistance
of a foreign affair,

07:47.601 --> 07:51.203
and I assure you that it
can work for you as well.

07:51.205 --> 07:53.772
So then you have to say
if it worked for John,

07:53.774 --> 07:57.108
you know, certainly, maybe,
maybe it could work for me.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.952
She's kind of cute.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.055
Cute.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.759
Possibly.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.596
A foreign affair

08:17.598 --> 08:20.599
is really just
an international version

08:20.601 --> 08:22.167
of any kind of
local dating service

08:22.169 --> 08:24.002
that you would go to online

08:24.004 --> 08:25.537
in order
to try to meet someone,

08:25.539 --> 08:28.540
only we focus more on
the international sector.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.109
We have about 16 or 17
different offices

08:31.111 --> 08:32.677
around the world,
and we're dealing with

08:32.679 --> 08:35.080
thousands and thousands
of clients every month.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.948
All you do is find
the computers, you can register,

08:37.951 --> 08:40.018
and you can start meeting
people from everywhere.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.852
I was lucky enough
to meet Tanya

08:41.855 --> 08:43.688
through a foreign affair,
actually,

08:43.690 --> 08:45.590
so, yeah, I'm a great example

08:45.592 --> 08:46.925
of how it can work,

08:46.927 --> 08:48.827
and it does work.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.829
What happens
when you're lucky enough

08:50.831 --> 08:53.765
to meet the love of your life?

08:53.767 --> 08:55.267
Over here.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.803
What happens
when you're lucky enough

08:58.805 --> 09:00.605
to meet the love of your life?

09:00.607 --> 09:02.040
Pretty slow.
A little slow over here.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.842
He's gotta wake up.
Get that coffee going.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.545
I met John when I was 27,

09:06.547 --> 09:07.946
and when I was 29,

09:07.948 --> 09:10.048
I moved to the United States.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.885
I came from
St. Petersburg, Russia.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.088
John said it's my first
marriage and your last.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.824
So, yeah, it's the second one.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.162
The Internet really changed
the way we date,

09:24.164 --> 09:25.864
both internationally
and domestically.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.667
When the men do go to the site,

09:28.669 --> 09:30.068
they have to register
on the site.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.771
And then they can
start writing letters

09:32.773 --> 09:35.874
to the women.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.342
You've got to pay for letters

09:37.344 --> 09:40.045
because it will actually
translate letters for you

09:40.047 --> 09:41.179
and get them to the women

09:41.181 --> 09:42.280
and get the replies
back for you.

09:42.282 --> 09:45.116
I got on the afa website,

09:45.118 --> 09:47.285
and I started
getting some letters

09:47.287 --> 09:49.988
from some women in Ukraine.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.923
I really didn't even know

09:51.925 --> 09:53.692
what Ukraine was.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.962
The women there
are just gorgeous.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.698
I found 10 women
that I really liked,

09:59.700 --> 10:01.866
so I started writing to them.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.301
All 10 wrote back.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.638
I spent a lot of money
in correspondence

10:06.640 --> 10:08.206
and I thought, you know,
you just gotta go over there

10:08.208 --> 10:10.842
and meet these women.

10:10.844 --> 10:11.910
John: As the Internet does grow

10:11.912 --> 10:13.378
and as the world shrinks,

10:13.380 --> 10:14.746
people are going to continue

10:14.748 --> 10:16.381
to start looking
outside the boundaries

10:16.383 --> 10:17.916
because why wouldn't you?

10:17.918 --> 10:19.684
It's right in
your own living room now.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.968
I am Elena petrova.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.305
I am the owner
of Elena's models,

10:40.307 --> 10:43.808
a dating agency
that specializes

10:43.810 --> 10:47.278
in introducing women
from eastern Europe

10:47.280 --> 10:51.016
with men from
all over the world.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.918
I was born in
yekaterinburg, Russia,

10:53.920 --> 10:57.389
and I moved to Australia
to join my husband

10:57.391 --> 10:59.791
about 15 years ago.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.292
You were a popular
mail order bride.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.896
Yes, I was a popular
mail order bride.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.932
Marriage for a woman
in eastern Europe,

11:07.934 --> 11:09.300
it's such a huge value.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.436
It's so up there,

11:11.438 --> 11:15.273
she's going to give up
anything to get it.

11:16.743 --> 11:21.379
We have more than 200,000
active profiles.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.349
We personally talk with
the majority of women

11:24.351 --> 11:25.984
before we approve
their profiles.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.986
Our business model
is very simple.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.821
You place your profile.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.690
You're responsible
for your profile.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.458
We just do our best

11:33.460 --> 11:36.227
to ensure that there are
only genuine, sincere people

11:36.229 --> 11:38.930
on our website.

11:38.932 --> 11:42.033
Okay. Let's go, mate.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.436
God, dumb machine.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.373
My name is Michael,

11:48.375 --> 11:51.076
and I can actually say
that in Russian, too.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.780
That's my name.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.885
Nice area this, huh?

12:02.389 --> 12:04.089
My first wife,

12:04.091 --> 12:06.491
she left me after 10 years.

12:06.493 --> 12:10.495
Threw all that out. So have I.

12:10.497 --> 12:16.334
My second wife passed
away with cancer in '98.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.304
She had leukemia
and it was quick.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.973
We were only married
for four years.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.977
Morning. How are you?

12:25.979 --> 12:29.080
I'm not getting younger.
I don't want to be alone.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.915
Been like that
for 12 years, you know,

12:30.917 --> 12:32.484
and it's not really happy.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.186
I support Elena's models

12:35.188 --> 12:37.455
because it's the honor system.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.358
You can contact
the girls, you know,

12:40.360 --> 12:42.393
once they're interested in you.

12:42.395 --> 12:46.064
And you can start talking
to them straight away.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.902
Svitlana sent me some pictures.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.871
That's svitlana.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.440
There's also
another one she sent me,

12:55.442 --> 12:57.275
and I really love this photo.

12:57.277 --> 13:01.880
I don't know, because
I just like her smile there.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.214
I saw svitlana.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.483
She was a newcomer on Elena's.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.886
I thought she looks nice,

13:07.888 --> 13:11.122
and she had this sort of like
sad look in her eyes.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.390
You know, I always
look for the eyes.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.925
I don't know, you know.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.127
And I thought I'll
give her a go, you know,

13:16.129 --> 13:18.329
although she was,
like, 37 years old.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.832
I thought, well, I'm just
gonna have a chat with her.

13:20.834 --> 13:24.569
Sasha, Elena. Svitlana's girls.

13:24.571 --> 13:28.139
Svitlana and that's Elena.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.842
We started communicating
through Elena's

13:30.844 --> 13:32.043
for a couple of months,

13:32.045 --> 13:34.212
and then she gave me
her email address

13:34.214 --> 13:36.381
and we started with email,
addressing her.

13:36.383 --> 13:40.518
Elena: In Ukraine, there
is 87 men for 100 women.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.921
And drinking is huge problem.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.155
Most Ukrainian guys,

13:44.157 --> 13:46.124
as they become
a bit older and older,

13:46.126 --> 13:47.358
they drink more and more.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.928
So lots of women
are using our website

13:49.930 --> 13:51.196
to meet someone

13:51.198 --> 13:54.299
simply because
there are not enough men

13:54.301 --> 13:56.501
that she can choose from.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.308
John: We want people to meet.

14:03.310 --> 14:06.110
We want them to be successful,

14:06.112 --> 14:09.914
to actually have
a meaningful relationship.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.150
We always preach they should
actually get on a plane

14:12.152 --> 14:14.018
and go over and meet
these women in person,

14:14.020 --> 14:15.954
because that's the only way

14:15.956 --> 14:17.522
anything's ever
going to happen for you

14:17.524 --> 14:19.390
if you want something
to happen for you.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.459
I'm sure you're wondering,

14:21.461 --> 14:23.995
"can I really travel
halfway around the world

14:23.997 --> 14:26.097
and develop
a meaningful relationship,

14:26.099 --> 14:28.399
one that will result
in marriage?"

14:28.401 --> 14:31.002
The answer is yes.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.404
The romance tour
is absolutely amazing.

14:33.406 --> 14:37.075
It is the best experience
that you'll ever have.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.143
My cousin told me
he would never do it.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.945
I said, "why?" He says,
"I wouldn't spend the money.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.380
I'm too much of a tightwad."

14:42.382 --> 14:45.183
And my answer was, "well,
what's happiness worth?

14:45.185 --> 14:47.886
$12,000 to meet
a beautiful woman

14:47.888 --> 14:49.387
that I love, that loves me?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.122
That's nothing."

14:51.124 --> 14:53.958
I don't really feel like
it's my last chance,

14:53.960 --> 14:55.994
but I just didn't want
to be along anymore

14:55.996 --> 14:58.997
and nothing was
happening around here.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.199
Why would anyone else
spend this kind of money

15:01.201 --> 15:03.134
to find a wife?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.003
Bob: We're going to
three separate cities

15:05.005 --> 15:09.007
during the trip: Odessa,
nikolayev, and kherson.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.909
It starts in New York at jfk,

15:10.911 --> 15:12.343
everybody's meeting
for the first time.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.346
Everybody's kind of
sizing everybody else up.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.148
It's kind of like a road trip

15:17.150 --> 15:18.683
if you're in
a fraternity, in a way,

15:18.685 --> 15:20.218
but it has a purpose,
of course,

15:20.220 --> 15:21.419
which a road trip does not.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.021
I'm Bob wray.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.188
I'm a tour director

15:24.190 --> 15:26.958
for a foreign affair tour.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.960
There's a lot of faith
involved in this.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.362
There has to be
because you're asking men,

15:31.364 --> 15:33.598
look, fork over
a few thousand dollars,

15:33.600 --> 15:35.633
take a couple of weeks
out of your schedule,

15:35.635 --> 15:37.302
and come over with us.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.085
- That's ours?
- That's ours.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.054
Gotta move.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.629
All right, guys. We made it!

16:04.631 --> 16:08.566
Welcome to Odessa, Ukraine.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.501
You can watch
the guys on the bus

16:10.503 --> 16:12.236
and they're kind of looking
around out the window,

16:12.238 --> 16:15.406
like, "wow, wow,
this is strange."

16:15.408 --> 16:17.508
You can just see them
just thinking and looking,

16:17.510 --> 16:20.645
and, you know, there's a
little bit of apprehension,

16:20.647 --> 16:22.080
a little bit of fear, maybe,

16:22.082 --> 16:23.381
a little bit
of all these things

16:23.383 --> 16:25.183
going through their minds

16:25.185 --> 16:27.518
because it's not the easiest
process in the world.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.120
It really isn't.

16:30.457 --> 16:34.592
Finding someone for
a relationship abroad

16:34.594 --> 16:37.996
is very similar
to finding a job abroad.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.164
If you can get better pay,

16:40.166 --> 16:42.000
you probably will go.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.235
Or if you want
adventure, you will go.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.438
If I can get more
than I can get locally,

16:47.440 --> 16:50.074
then I'll go.

16:50.076 --> 16:53.678
One day, svitlana asked me,
am I for real?

16:53.680 --> 16:57.315
I said I'm for real.
I'll come see you.

16:57.317 --> 17:00.418
So I'm planning
to fly over to Kiev

17:00.420 --> 17:02.053
for a week.

17:08.528 --> 17:12.096
I don't like something
that's ordinary.

17:12.098 --> 17:13.765
I like something that's
out of the ordinary.

17:13.767 --> 17:17.300
I suppose that's why
I'm going to Russia for a girl.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.604
I like something
out of the ordinary.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.487
Michael: It's an adventure,
you know.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.156
For me, I like adventure.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.691
I feel motivated by doing it.

17:41.795 --> 17:44.295
I really feel motivated.

17:44.297 --> 17:48.232
I did not really achieve
what I wanted in life.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.768
I need some more time.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.571
I just want to be happy
and it doesn't matter where,

17:53.573 --> 17:55.406
where I'm going to find it,
you know.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.674
If it's here
in the Ukraine, why not?

17:56.676 --> 17:57.708
I'll come here.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.418
Yippy kay-ay.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.288
All right, guys.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.091
We're gonna get started here
with this orientation.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.626
Now, a social,
it's not a cocktail party.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.128
It's a great opportunity

18:17.130 --> 18:19.530
to meet a lot of different
people at one time.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.532
Right? It's all about
moving around

18:21.534 --> 18:23.668
as much as possible
to try to meet

18:23.670 --> 18:25.703
as many different people
as possible.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.805
The first big event of this
whole tour is the social.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.208
That's what everybody's
looking forward to,

18:30.210 --> 18:32.810
so everybody is ready for that.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.646
I don't have any expectations.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.548
My plans are to shake the hands

18:37.550 --> 18:39.250
of every single woman
there tonight.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.852
Hi. I'm Ron.

18:40.854 --> 18:44.589
I am Ron. And I am Ron.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.176
I really want to welcome
you all for coming.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.378
It's really important that if
you see someone that you like,

19:07.380 --> 19:08.513
don't be shy.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.580
Just go up to him

19:09.582 --> 19:11.182
and say, hey,
can I talk to you?

19:11.184 --> 19:13.451
I guarantee you that the men

19:13.453 --> 19:15.353
are more shy than you are.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.288
It was like being a kid
in a candy store.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.758
I wasn't really quite
sure how to handle it.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.161
My job is to go around

19:23.163 --> 19:26.831
and encourage the men to be as
proactive as they possibly can

19:26.833 --> 19:29.333
and talk to as many women
as they possibly can,

19:29.335 --> 19:31.802
and have a good time
at the same time.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.838
I'm overwhelmed by the
attention I've gotten.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.273
A lot of my friends
who are single

19:35.275 --> 19:37.642
thought I was crazy
to come over here,

19:37.644 --> 19:39.944
but I tend to always
think outside the box.

19:39.946 --> 19:44.482
We had 210 women
at that social.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.184
20 guys.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.885
A 10 to 1 ratio.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.188
Welcome to paradise.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.790
For me, it's been
very nerve-wracking.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.526
A lot of beautiful women,

19:55.528 --> 19:57.695
and it's not like that at home.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.430
They just can't believe

19:59.432 --> 20:01.199
that these women
are interested in them,

20:01.201 --> 20:02.967
because they're used to
the situation at home

20:02.969 --> 20:04.735
where nobody's
interested in them.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.942
These women
believe in family first.

20:10.944 --> 20:13.211
Not career first. Family first.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.346
I'll tell you, it's like
dating a girl from the fifties.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.814
It's like dating my mom.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.984
� American boys �

20:24.524 --> 20:26.691
I can speak in front
of 3,000 people,

20:26.693 --> 20:29.327
but getting on
that dance floor,

20:29.329 --> 20:30.561
that makes me nervous.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.562
You gonna do it?

20:31.564 --> 20:32.897
Growing up Southern baptist,

20:32.899 --> 20:35.233
I've never danced.

20:35.235 --> 20:38.336
If I find the right one,
I might.

20:38.338 --> 20:42.273
I've been trying to be
realistic in my search.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.874
I'm in pretty good shape
for my age,

20:43.876 --> 20:45.843
but I can certainly feel my age

20:45.845 --> 20:47.345
in the last three years.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.881
Would you like to dance?

20:50.883 --> 20:52.350
Okay.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.887
I want someone who still
loves me for me,

20:56.889 --> 20:59.690
you know, when
I'm not as virile,

20:59.692 --> 21:02.827
when I am starting
to fall apart.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.729
You know, and I wouldn't mind

21:04.731 --> 21:06.897
falling apart with someone.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.001
My name is Ron.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.802
My name is Serena.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.704
So you speak English?

21:13.706 --> 21:15.973
And how old are you?

21:15.975 --> 21:18.409
It's a secret.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.311
Well, that's important.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.046
Yes, yes.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.415
If you're 25 years
younger than me,

21:24.417 --> 21:27.585
then they're not gonna be
falling apart with me.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.859
Tell me about the woman
that you met.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.827
What happened when you met?

21:36.829 --> 21:38.663
Instant sparks.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.698
I can't explain it.

21:40.700 --> 21:44.635
Even though she speaks
very little English

21:44.637 --> 21:49.307
and I speak no Russian,
it was just instant sparks.

21:49.309 --> 21:52.410
Her name's Victoria.
We met at the social.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.346
Danced for a while,
talked for a while.

21:55.348 --> 21:58.749
I never left her side
till late the next afternoon

21:58.751 --> 22:00.484
to go to the hotel, freshen up,

22:00.486 --> 22:03.087
and went back to spend
more time with her.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.690
In a perfect world,

22:05.692 --> 22:07.892
this would just keep going

22:07.894 --> 22:10.661
as awesome and wonderful
as it's been.

22:10.663 --> 22:14.598
And if it keeps going
in the direction that it is,

22:14.600 --> 22:17.768
I plan on being engaged
before I leave.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.118
- How are you?
- Did you sleep well?

22:34.120 --> 22:36.921
I did, the little bit
I slept, yeah.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.956
Okay, guys, I'm glad to see
that you all survived.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.491
Odessa so far.

22:40.493 --> 22:43.127
So now that you have
one social under your belt,

22:43.129 --> 22:45.463
you have a little better idea

22:45.465 --> 22:48.666
how to manipulate
and maneuver in the social.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.935
In nikolayev,
the social will be held

22:50.937 --> 22:54.105
at a nightclub
that's called the illusion.

22:54.107 --> 22:55.706
When you're dating, you know

22:55.708 --> 22:57.007
that could be
appropriate, right?

22:57.009 --> 22:58.642
You guys have fun with it

22:58.644 --> 23:00.644
and hopefully you'll find
that one woman

23:00.646 --> 23:03.581
that you can really
connect with.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.491
We arrive
at the social at 5:00,

23:13.493 --> 23:14.759
and it's jammed.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.927
I mean, there are women
everywhere.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.662
Guys are making time
in the line.

23:18.664 --> 23:19.830
I mean, they're
talking to the girls

23:19.832 --> 23:20.865
and the girls
aren't even in yet.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.032
They got their coats still on.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.768
They got one social
under their belt,

23:23.770 --> 23:25.936
they're veterans now.
They're not rookies anymore.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.171
They know what they're doing.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.840
Ah, the beginnings
of another social.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.712
How do they do that?

23:36.482 --> 23:38.015
Did you see that?

23:39.118 --> 23:41.886
I've been to Ukraine

23:41.888 --> 23:43.754
on six different trips,

23:43.756 --> 23:46.791
and when I walk in
to the social,

23:46.793 --> 23:49.493
of course, I'm
always uncomfortable

23:49.495 --> 23:50.995
'cause there's a lot
of people in that room

23:50.997 --> 23:53.497
and there's a lot of beautiful
women in that room.

23:53.499 --> 23:55.733
So the hardest part for me

23:55.735 --> 23:57.468
is to just start
with the first one.

23:57.470 --> 23:58.936
And I take my interpreter

23:58.938 --> 24:01.038
and we start walking the room.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.707
There sitting at
this table by herself

24:03.709 --> 24:07.111
is a very tall, beautiful girl

24:07.113 --> 24:09.180
with long blonde hair.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.465
She fit all the criteria

24:27.467 --> 24:30.167
that I kind of went
on this trip with.

24:40.746 --> 24:43.614
We talked for quite a long time

24:43.616 --> 24:45.783
and she was
definitely interested

24:45.785 --> 24:48.853
in the possibility of
what it could turn into.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.188
Some of these guys just
haven't dated in a long time,

24:51.190 --> 24:53.691
and these passions,
these feelings

24:53.693 --> 24:55.826
I don't think they've felt
for years and years.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.228
And all of a sudden,

24:57.230 --> 24:59.163
they're really just
exploring it all over again.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.032
� I want a girl like you �

25:02.034 --> 25:03.934
� who wants a boy like me �

25:03.936 --> 25:05.903
� who gets a girl like you �

25:05.905 --> 25:09.139
I'm skeptical on this.

25:09.141 --> 25:12.142
Having talked to some
of the translators here,

25:12.144 --> 25:13.844
when I've asked them,

25:13.846 --> 25:16.780
"tell me what percentage
of the women here

25:16.782 --> 25:18.682
are truly in their heart
interested

25:18.684 --> 25:20.251
in finding a man,
being married."

25:20.253 --> 25:22.620
I mean, they're giving me
some really low numbers.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.221
Do you have any children?

25:24.223 --> 25:26.857
- No.
- Okay.

25:26.859 --> 25:30.628
Hold on. I'm looking for
someone with no children.

25:30.630 --> 25:33.664
I've certainly not met anyone
age appropriate for me.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.875
Last night, I met
a girl at a social.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.211
Somehow we started chatting,

25:47.213 --> 25:49.713
even though she
doesn't speak English.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.682
We ended up dancing together

25:51.684 --> 25:53.017
the rest of the night.

25:53.019 --> 25:55.185
And when we were at the club,

25:55.187 --> 25:57.121
she asked me on a date,

25:57.123 --> 25:59.323
so we have a date
tonight at 7:00.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.258
And her name is vitalina.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.866
I'm looking for
a partner, you know.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.768
A lover, a friend.

26:10.770 --> 26:13.304
I've got
a great life, you know.

26:13.306 --> 26:15.239
There's just that
one piece missing.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.311
Tell her she looks
very pretty tonight.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.017
Thank you.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.129
She say that she like you

26:39.131 --> 26:41.799
from your first meeting,

26:41.801 --> 26:46.604
and she say
she just want, like...

26:46.606 --> 26:49.974
to hold with him,
that he hold me or hug me,

26:49.976 --> 26:52.242
and just no talk.

26:52.244 --> 26:57.114
Just sit and she feel
very comfortable with you.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.916
Comfortable, yeah.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.385
So we don't need
an interpreter for that.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.253
- I agree with you.
- Yeah.

27:03.255 --> 27:04.355
I agree with you.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.858
I was sort of, like, nervous

27:40.860 --> 27:44.862
because I didn't know
what to expect, yeah.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.764
But I could see
she's all smiles

27:46.766 --> 27:49.333
and things like that.

27:49.335 --> 27:53.003
I believe that it's good

27:53.005 --> 27:54.838
for both Western men

27:54.840 --> 27:56.774
and Ukrainian women

27:56.776 --> 28:00.277
to be able to explore
options elsewhere

28:00.279 --> 28:03.147
because it's always great

28:03.149 --> 28:05.049
when you can expand
your horizons

28:05.051 --> 28:07.685
and understand
what is right for you.

28:10.356 --> 28:13.057
I didn't come here
just for entertainment.

28:13.059 --> 28:16.093
I really want to make it
with her, you know.

28:16.095 --> 28:20.964
We've been talking about it
on the Internet all the time.

28:20.966 --> 28:24.468
I told her we'll take it
one step at a time.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.173
Who won? Who won?

28:29.175 --> 28:30.908
I don't know.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.213
All right, guys.

28:36.215 --> 28:40.718
Well, you've now survived
two socials.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.152
I congratulate all of you

28:42.154 --> 28:44.254
for going to
the third and final social

28:44.256 --> 28:45.756
here in kherson.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.424
It's gonna be over
before you know it.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.959
Nothing really matters.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.327
Just go up, talk to
whoever you want to talk to.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.895
Make something happen.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.430
I mean, you know,
don't sit there and be shy.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.099
Just go up and do it

28:55.101 --> 28:57.101
because you'll probably
never see her again anyway.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.302
She lives in the Ukraine.

28:58.304 --> 29:00.237
This is your opportunity.
This is it.

29:02.875 --> 29:06.510
It's the last city
and I'm down to one.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.445
To be honest,
this is probably the one

29:08.447 --> 29:12.082
that my eye
always came back to.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.251
Her name is Julia.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.987
She works at a travel agency.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.989
Incredibly beautiful.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.424
We've been writing
to each other

29:20.426 --> 29:22.826
for... it's got to be
seven, eight months now.

29:22.828 --> 29:25.195
We'll meet at the social.

29:25.197 --> 29:28.198
I'm coming to basically try
to sweep her off her feet.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.900
Do you have pictures of her?

29:29.902 --> 29:31.468
Yeah.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.138
How old is she?

29:34.140 --> 29:38.475
26. She was a little bit
under my target age.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.410
This is the one
from the website

29:40.412 --> 29:42.880
where she looks like
Angelina Jolie.

29:42.882 --> 29:46.450
Yeah. She does.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.852
How can you go wrong there?

30:03.502 --> 30:05.936
A little nervous.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.071
Just waiting.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.174
This last
hour and a half of wait

30:10.176 --> 30:12.342
is just driving me up a wall.

30:15.548 --> 30:17.414
Something a little special.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.284
All the other guys,
they go out and buy roses.

30:20.286 --> 30:23.086
I wanted to get
something that would last

30:23.088 --> 30:25.589
hopefully as long
as the relationship.

30:25.591 --> 30:31.595
So one gold rose.

30:31.597 --> 30:35.032
Hopefully it gets her this
and everything will be okay.

30:35.034 --> 30:38.001
And I'll be either
really happy or really sad.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.073
This is like prom for old guys.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.908
That's the way
I'm looking at it,

30:44.910 --> 30:47.544
which is nice, since
I never went to prom, so...

30:51.550 --> 30:53.050
Thank you.

31:02.127 --> 31:03.527
I'm sort of hoping

31:03.529 --> 31:06.063
to have a table off by
ourselves the whole night.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.598
It will have a translator

31:07.600 --> 31:09.466
because she doesn't
speak English,

31:09.468 --> 31:11.201
I don't do Russian.

31:11.203 --> 31:14.638
So we can just treat that
as our first date.

31:16.475 --> 31:19.309
Every time I see someone with
black hair walk in the door,

31:19.311 --> 31:21.178
my heart goes, uh!
Oh, it's not her.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.980
Uh! Not her.

31:22.982 --> 31:26.650
When I did my search, I looked
for certain specific things.

31:26.652 --> 31:30.087
I like women that have
black hair, blue eyes.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.289
People that are smart,
that are independent.

31:32.291 --> 31:36.159
Someone that's gonna make me
want to be a better me.

31:36.161 --> 31:39.930
Your climactic moment
is gonna happen any minute.

31:39.932 --> 31:42.099
Yeah, I'm hoping.

31:42.101 --> 31:45.402
When the guys come over,

31:45.404 --> 31:47.504
they have their own set
of expectations,

31:47.506 --> 31:50.107
which may be on target
and may not be on target.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.508
And they think, oh, gee,

31:51.510 --> 31:54.978
I've been writing to Irina,
svitlana, Elena.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.113
I've been writing
to all these women

31:56.115 --> 31:57.614
and they write to me,

31:57.616 --> 31:59.983
and I wrote to them,
I told them I was coming over.

31:59.985 --> 32:02.986
And maybe that works
and maybe that doesn't.

32:32.651 --> 32:36.053
Hi. Are the women
checking in with you, too?

32:36.055 --> 32:38.021
Only her.

32:38.023 --> 32:41.658
Oh, okay. No English.

32:41.660 --> 32:42.960
Perfect.

32:50.469 --> 32:54.705
I thought she was going to show up.
I really did.

32:54.707 --> 32:57.074
So I made sure I was
staying off by myself

32:57.076 --> 32:59.209
because I didn't want to
have to fend off other women,

32:59.211 --> 33:02.212
trying to keep them away while
I'm trying to wait for her.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.381
Now, I wanted to come in here

33:04.383 --> 33:07.384
to this place
to meet this person

33:07.386 --> 33:10.253
and now I don't know
what's going on.

33:24.136 --> 33:26.169
So how are you feeling?

33:26.171 --> 33:29.006
Like anybody would feel.

33:29.008 --> 33:31.742
Definitely not good.

33:31.744 --> 33:33.577
So I had a conversation
with John this morning.

33:33.579 --> 33:36.580
I said, you know, the lady
I'm talking to online,

33:36.582 --> 33:39.049
the lady I'm writing to,

33:39.051 --> 33:42.019
works full time
in a tourist agency.

33:42.021 --> 33:45.555
Monday through Friday,
half a day Saturdays,

33:45.557 --> 33:47.657
and isn't a student.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.693
And the person
that Max is talking to

33:49.695 --> 33:51.428
is a student half time.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.163
I said, you know, I've
been writing this lady,

33:53.165 --> 33:58.268
you know, almost daily
for months now.

33:58.270 --> 34:01.638
Email are $10 a pop
going and coming,

34:01.640 --> 34:05.709
so I'm probably out 10 grand.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.078
My biggest fear
is that it was a scam.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.547
That she's writing
to 50 or 60 guys

34:10.549 --> 34:12.248
and she's getting
a cut of the fees

34:12.251 --> 34:14.284
for the emails
going back and forth.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.786
John said he's concerned
about that, too,

34:15.788 --> 34:19.188
so he's trying to find out
what's really going on.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.091
As he said, you know, well,
there's other women to meet.

34:21.092 --> 34:22.659
I said I didn't come here
to meet other women.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.561
That's not what I was here for.

34:37.309 --> 34:42.079
I say, I can understand

34:42.081 --> 34:46.248
why there's such a lot
of Ukrainian dating sites,

34:46.251 --> 34:48.851
because the women here
are truly beautiful.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.855
But I've only got eyes
for mine.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.583
It's not easy giving
your whole life up and move.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.852
Really, it's not that easy.

35:21.854 --> 35:23.253
I live in Australia,

35:23.255 --> 35:25.155
and there's
a lot of opportunity.

35:25.157 --> 35:27.157
But then, she's got
a business here.

35:27.159 --> 35:30.360
She's got her family here,
you know.

35:30.362 --> 35:33.163
If she wants to have
a good life with me,

35:33.165 --> 35:35.265
I will really look after her

35:35.267 --> 35:37.300
and take care of her.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.803
So she's got to decide
what she wants to do.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.811
Max just called me and told me

35:47.813 --> 35:51.481
that she'd be down there at
5:00 in the lobby, so...

35:53.252 --> 35:55.919
They finally
got ahold of Julia,

35:55.921 --> 35:58.255
and she is supposed
to be coming here

35:58.257 --> 36:00.590
in about half an hour, hour,

36:00.592 --> 36:02.592
for our first date.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.297
I have to go in there

36:07.299 --> 36:10.433
approaching it like she's
honest and all that

36:10.435 --> 36:14.204
and hoping that
I'm not being screwed.

36:14.206 --> 36:16.873
So...

36:16.875 --> 36:18.775
And it's been hours.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.211
I've been sitting here thinking
the same thing over and over.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.246
How do I know?

36:23.248 --> 36:25.682
How do you know?
How do you tell?

36:31.757 --> 36:33.857
- Hi.
- How you doing?

36:33.859 --> 36:35.625
Welcome.

36:35.627 --> 36:38.562
Sorry.

36:38.564 --> 36:41.865
We've been writing for about
seven, eight months now.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.867
I was wondering
what your feeling is

36:43.869 --> 36:45.569
on the relationship.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.214
And what do you say?

36:57.216 --> 36:58.982
We've been writing for so long,

36:58.984 --> 37:00.650
I was hoping that we'd
be able to move on.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.352
I came here to see you.

37:02.354 --> 37:04.321
It's the only reason I came,

37:04.323 --> 37:07.490
was to see if
you wanted to move

37:07.492 --> 37:09.559
maybe further
in the relationship.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.228
Do you feel like
she was the woman

37:11.230 --> 37:12.295
that was writing to you?

37:12.297 --> 37:15.665
I had some questions and doubts

37:15.667 --> 37:17.467
because the pictures
I showed her

37:17.469 --> 37:20.570
were pictures of things
that she's seen before...

37:20.572 --> 37:23.673
the house, the yard, my work.

37:25.844 --> 37:26.977
People in black.

37:28.814 --> 37:29.980
This is actually pictures

37:29.982 --> 37:31.915
from the last shuttle launch.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.751
Wow.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.886
If she wasn't the one
writing the letters,

37:36.888 --> 37:38.989
does it matter?

37:38.991 --> 37:42.325
It would have

37:42.327 --> 37:44.794
and probably should.

37:44.796 --> 37:47.564
But what I don't want to do
is for me to overthink it

37:47.566 --> 37:50.267
and cause the problem
that isn't really there.

37:50.269 --> 37:54.004
I guess, honestly, I can't get
this girl out of my mind.

37:54.006 --> 37:57.941
Something that's special
and beautiful and unique

37:57.943 --> 37:59.943
shouldn't be alone,
they should come in pairs.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.378
And I was hoping...

38:01.380 --> 38:03.480
I may not be,
you know, beautiful

38:03.482 --> 38:06.049
and that unique, but I'm hoping

38:06.051 --> 38:07.817
that maybe we could be a pair.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.755
You are very inspiring.

38:20.399 --> 38:21.865
Yeah.

38:21.867 --> 38:24.634
And we'll have them, too.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.537
Do you want to come to
America and marry me?

38:33.545 --> 38:35.979
Let's move into this direction.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.414
Okay.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.952
Can I, please?

38:45.390 --> 38:47.824
So, what was your
impressions of tonight?

38:49.561 --> 38:50.894
I think it went really well.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.562
I think I'm engaged now,

38:52.564 --> 38:55.732
so I'd have to say
it's going really well.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.768
Did you get her email address?

38:58.770 --> 39:01.037
No. Gotta still go
through the service

39:01.039 --> 39:02.939
because I need to have
the translations.

39:02.941 --> 39:04.908
So we'll go through that.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.343
I can ask her through that

39:06.345 --> 39:07.977
if she wants to give me
her email address.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.413
I don't know if she has one.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.549
Didn't even think to ask.

39:12.551 --> 39:15.051
A little preoccupied.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.753
You're engaged.

39:16.755 --> 39:19.989
I'm engaged.

39:24.496 --> 39:26.663
I want to settle down again
with a good girl,

39:26.665 --> 39:29.933
and I think svitlana
is a good girl.

39:29.935 --> 39:33.136
We had a wonderful time
in Kiev.

39:33.138 --> 39:34.804
I asked her
do you wanna marry me?

39:34.806 --> 39:36.706
And she said yes,
and that's it.

39:36.708 --> 39:40.643
So we're going
to get married in Bali.

39:40.645 --> 39:43.380
I'm gonna try and I'll
give it my best shot.

39:43.382 --> 39:46.850
If it depends on me,
I will make it work.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.488
I'm very impressed
with the tour.

39:51.490 --> 39:55.592
I think for the cost,
you get a lot.

39:55.594 --> 39:59.596
Next Christmas, I would
like to be either married

39:59.598 --> 40:01.765
or real close to being married.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.800
They're not
that fucking friendly.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.168
They're not.

40:05.170 --> 40:08.872
Now that I'm leaving,
that's how I feel.

40:08.874 --> 40:11.875
No, I don't think
most of the people here

40:11.877 --> 40:13.743
like Americans particularly.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.513
You take a woman
from the Ukraine,

40:16.515 --> 40:19.582
and you have to overcome
the language barrier

40:19.584 --> 40:21.151
if she doesn't speak
excellent English.

40:21.153 --> 40:22.852
More importantly,
you have to overcome

40:22.854 --> 40:25.021
the cultural difference.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.823
But would I come back
to the Ukraine

40:26.825 --> 40:30.427
or anywhere
to look for a bride? No.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.730
I met one girl
that I really liked.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.465
So we probably spent about

40:35.467 --> 40:40.036
a total of three hours
actually face to face.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.828
I was only hoping
that this would happen.

41:04.830 --> 41:07.764
I never dreamed
that it actually would.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.767
Yeah.

41:12.637 --> 41:15.071
I really don't want to leave.

41:15.073 --> 41:17.073
Kind of have to.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.943
It's really rough
leaving Victoria here.

41:19.945 --> 41:24.514
I'll try to keep in
constant contact with her.

41:24.516 --> 41:28.151
Hopefully Skype a lot,
talk on the phone.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.853
Anything else you want to say

41:29.855 --> 41:32.822
before you say goodbye
to Victoria?

41:35.527 --> 41:38.228
Too much. No, I can't.

41:38.230 --> 41:39.896
You pretty torn up?

41:39.898 --> 41:41.764
Yeah, very.

41:41.766 --> 41:43.166
So are you gonna be okay?

41:45.003 --> 41:47.036
I don't know. We'll see.

41:49.941 --> 41:51.574
It's so hard to tell you

41:51.576 --> 41:53.209
who I think will be successful,

41:53.211 --> 41:55.044
because, to me,
if someone comes over

41:55.046 --> 41:57.247
and has a wonderful time,
it opens their eyes,

41:57.249 --> 41:59.148
that's a successful time.

41:59.150 --> 42:01.217
But as far as finding
that one woman

42:01.219 --> 42:04.020
and getting married, if you
define that as success,

42:04.022 --> 42:05.688
that's really hard to tell

42:05.690 --> 42:07.690
because this is real life.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.158
This isn't controlled.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.261
They're all adults
we're introducing,

42:11.263 --> 42:13.162
and whatever happens happens.

42:47.332 --> 42:51.067
It's been almost three
months since I've seen vica.

42:51.069 --> 42:53.770
When I left Odessa,

42:53.772 --> 42:55.772
I knew we had
a great connection

42:55.774 --> 42:59.909
and, you know, we obviously
liked each other very much.

42:59.911 --> 43:03.680
You know, I can't say
I was in love.

43:03.682 --> 43:07.750
I knew I liked her a lot.

43:07.752 --> 43:10.820
I've never felt that right
away with anyone else,

43:10.822 --> 43:12.956
and I didn't want to lose that.

43:12.958 --> 43:15.258
Come on, get up.

43:15.260 --> 43:18.261
After coming back home,

43:18.263 --> 43:20.997
I did not know
I was in love with her

43:20.999 --> 43:24.233
until I seen the video
that afa had

43:24.235 --> 43:26.769
on their website
from December tour.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.004
Come on.

43:29.307 --> 43:31.741
First time I seen it,
I balled my eyes out.

43:31.743 --> 43:34.243
That was when I knew.

43:35.780 --> 43:40.083
It just brought back everything

43:40.085 --> 43:42.785
'cause I knew exactly
what she was doing.

43:42.787 --> 43:44.754
She was singing to me
in Russian.

43:45.957 --> 43:48.024
It brought that back instantly.

43:50.161 --> 43:53.262
I still can't watch it.

43:56.101 --> 43:57.900
I'll be there
in one week today.

43:57.902 --> 44:00.937
I can't hardly sleep.

44:13.284 --> 44:17.387
I've been to Ukraine
on six different trips

44:17.389 --> 44:20.123
over the course
of about nine years.

44:20.125 --> 44:24.127
I've probably dated
35 to 50 women

44:24.129 --> 44:26.396
that I met there,

44:26.398 --> 44:29.365
and all indications are
that I have found someone

44:29.367 --> 44:32.001
that is truly serious

44:32.003 --> 44:34.771
about building
a committed relationship

44:34.773 --> 44:36.939
and coming to the U.S.

44:36.941 --> 44:40.009
So I leave
on my seventh journey

44:40.011 --> 44:41.344
in two days,

44:41.346 --> 44:44.213
and we will be back together

44:44.215 --> 44:46.382
in about a week and a half.

45:15.847 --> 45:17.346
For inna.

45:20.418 --> 45:23.319
I got her this engagement ring.

45:49.814 --> 45:54.050
I can't wait to see you
at the airport.

46:05.530 --> 46:06.996
I agree.

46:06.998 --> 46:09.866
I'll miss you until I see you

46:09.868 --> 46:11.400
at the airport.

46:11.402 --> 46:14.003
Okay. Bye-bye.

46:14.005 --> 46:15.304
Goodbye.

46:18.543 --> 46:20.843
I really am looking forward

46:20.845 --> 46:24.881
to coming through
that gate at the airport

46:24.883 --> 46:28.017
and looking into her eyes again

46:28.019 --> 46:31.354
and reconnect physically.

46:32.791 --> 46:35.324
I just want to hold her.

46:54.579 --> 46:57.346
- Robert.
- Hey, sweetheart.

46:58.850 --> 47:00.483
How are you?

47:00.485 --> 47:03.119
Oh.

47:05.223 --> 47:07.456
I came back
and vita was available.

47:07.458 --> 47:09.492
She would meet me anytime.

47:09.494 --> 47:10.960
I said can we Skype
here, can we Skype...

47:10.962 --> 47:12.295
she was available.

47:15.033 --> 47:16.399
What did she say?

47:16.401 --> 47:17.967
She's just laughing.

47:17.969 --> 47:19.435
It's refreshing.

47:19.437 --> 47:22.538
The innocence that she has,

47:22.540 --> 47:26.175
it's just really made
an impression on me.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.343
There's a lot of affection.

47:27.345 --> 47:29.145
There was immediately.

47:29.147 --> 47:31.514
When you're walking down
the street arm in arm,

47:31.516 --> 47:34.183
who needs to speak
the same language, you know?

47:34.185 --> 47:36.252
So when I came back,

47:36.254 --> 47:38.321
within the first week or two,

47:38.323 --> 47:41.524
I thought, "this actually
may work out."

47:41.526 --> 47:43.359
And it wasn't
too long after that

47:43.361 --> 47:46.462
I decided that I was
going back to see her.

47:47.599 --> 47:50.433
And here's my lovely miss vita.

47:50.435 --> 47:53.469
I went back with the idea

47:53.471 --> 47:54.904
that I was gonna
ask her to marry me

47:54.906 --> 47:56.539
and get engaged.

47:58.443 --> 48:01.177
I think within
the first hour of being there,

48:01.179 --> 48:03.512
I proposed to her, you know.

48:03.514 --> 48:06.415
She said yes.

48:06.417 --> 48:08.517
Logic would have said
wait a few days.

48:08.519 --> 48:09.886
You never know.

48:09.888 --> 48:13.956
The hell with logic.
It felt right.

48:13.958 --> 48:18.127
And if anything, that made
the rest of the eight days

48:18.129 --> 48:19.562
that much better.

48:21.599 --> 48:24.367
She called her mom,
told her mom.

48:24.369 --> 48:27.603
And then I asked that I would
like to meet her parents.

48:27.605 --> 48:31.240
Probably the most nervous
on the whole trip

48:31.242 --> 48:33.209
is when I met her parents.

48:55.633 --> 48:57.500
I love you, Bob.

48:57.502 --> 48:59.602
I love you, too, vitalina.

49:12.650 --> 49:16.085
So what's the next step?

49:16.087 --> 49:19.989
It's the application process
for the fianc�e visa.

49:19.991 --> 49:22.558
Eventually, she'll have
an interview with the embassy

49:22.560 --> 49:24.994
where she'll
have to provide documents.

49:24.996 --> 49:28.397
Once you file,
it's just waiting.

49:28.399 --> 49:32.668
It's gonna be
a long six months.

49:32.670 --> 49:34.236
Hopefully it works out with us.

49:34.238 --> 49:36.138
If it doesn't, it doesn't.

49:36.140 --> 49:38.641
I hope it does, I think
it is, but it may not.

49:38.643 --> 49:40.343
You never know.

49:51.990 --> 49:55.024
Two days before we got married,

49:55.026 --> 49:57.226
I got an email that says,

49:57.228 --> 49:59.295
my name is alexy.
You do not know me,

49:59.297 --> 50:01.263
but I'm working with
svitlana for okina,

50:01.265 --> 50:03.466
so I know her very well

50:03.468 --> 50:05.735
and heard a lot about you,

50:05.737 --> 50:07.536
so I want to warn you.

50:07.538 --> 50:11.107
Svitlana works with
illegal dating agency,

50:11.109 --> 50:14.243
which by fraud lures
foreigners to Ukraine

50:14.245 --> 50:16.178
for dating beautiful women

50:16.180 --> 50:19.248
and then takes all
their money. Bleed white.

50:19.250 --> 50:21.650
I know that you have planned
a wedding in Bali.

50:21.652 --> 50:23.753
She will fly to Bali
for your money.

50:23.755 --> 50:27.390
She will bring the borrowed
wedding dress as proof.

50:27.392 --> 50:30.793
But I can assure you
the wedding will not happen.

50:40.738 --> 50:43.272
I told svitlana
about the bad email

50:43.274 --> 50:49.178
that I got from Kiev,
and she's quite shocked.

50:49.180 --> 50:51.080
I suppose it's somebody

50:51.082 --> 50:53.616
that don't really want her
to get married.

50:53.618 --> 50:57.420
The letter was saying,
you know, I'm just a donkey,

50:57.422 --> 50:59.188
and they'll just
use me, you know.

50:59.190 --> 51:00.489
I don't know.

51:00.491 --> 51:02.124
I'm just very
stressed out, you know.

51:02.126 --> 51:05.594
Already I can feel it.
It's building up again.

51:11.069 --> 51:13.636
I was waiting for anything
to happen, you know,

51:13.638 --> 51:15.771
but nothing happened.

51:15.773 --> 51:20.342
We went to the Australian
embassy in denpasar

51:20.344 --> 51:22.178
and we did the paperwork

51:22.180 --> 51:24.213
and she was happy
to do everything.

51:24.215 --> 51:28.084
You know, I mean, she could
have bailed out anytime.

51:28.086 --> 51:30.086
She did not.

51:30.088 --> 51:32.354
We can't get into
every person's head.

51:32.356 --> 51:36.425
We don't know their motives.

51:36.427 --> 51:38.360
We don't know how
they're going to feel

51:38.362 --> 51:39.862
about this particular person,

51:39.864 --> 51:42.665
how they're going to behave
in that relationship.

51:42.667 --> 51:45.734
It's all basically
your responsibility.

51:45.736 --> 51:51.707
And your responsibility is to try
to build a real relationship.

52:00.751 --> 52:02.651
We got through.

52:02.653 --> 52:05.121
We got married and that's it.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.894
There's a temporary
visitors visa

52:11.896 --> 52:15.598
where she can come over
in a matter of three months,

52:15.600 --> 52:18.601
and I've got to apply for that.

52:18.603 --> 52:23.405
So tomorrow we're going
our separate ways again.

52:29.814 --> 52:31.881
How were you feeling
on your way home?

52:31.883 --> 52:33.649
Mixed feelings.

52:33.651 --> 52:36.619
I mean, sort of good
that, you know,

52:36.621 --> 52:41.390
I met her and she was
a very attractive lady.

52:41.392 --> 52:42.758
Thinking that maybe
something's going to happen,

52:42.760 --> 52:45.394
but still had that
nagging feeling

52:45.396 --> 52:48.397
that something was wrong.

52:50.201 --> 52:53.235
But you left thinking
you were engaged.

52:53.237 --> 52:56.405
I left thinking that we
were gonna get married.

52:56.407 --> 52:58.641
When I got back,

52:58.643 --> 53:00.910
we were corresponding
very, very frequently,

53:00.912 --> 53:05.314
but every time I would
ask her something personal,

53:05.316 --> 53:08.951
she just never answered
the question,

53:08.953 --> 53:12.288
so it really started
bothering me.

53:12.290 --> 53:13.822
Eventually I just gave up.

53:13.824 --> 53:15.591
I said, listen, you either
gotta answer the questions

53:15.593 --> 53:16.892
or that's it, I'm done.

53:16.894 --> 53:18.494
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

53:18.496 --> 53:20.896
So she sent me one final letter

53:20.898 --> 53:22.731
saying that
she was hurt, you know,

53:22.733 --> 53:24.700
I wasn't the person
she thought I was.

53:24.702 --> 53:28.337
I was like, well, okay.

53:28.339 --> 53:31.640
It was over.

53:31.642 --> 53:33.576
So why did you propose to her

53:33.578 --> 53:35.544
knowing that
something was wrong?

53:35.546 --> 53:40.382
What was I gonna lose
at that point?

53:40.384 --> 53:44.353
You don't think that he
was mislead or scammed?

53:44.355 --> 53:48.524
I don't think so, but
I'm not 100% sure yet.

53:48.526 --> 53:49.959
You know, I have my doubts.

53:49.961 --> 53:52.361
So we removed the woman
from the site.

53:52.363 --> 53:54.863
We have taken her off.

53:54.865 --> 53:56.365
You know, if she wasn't legit,

53:56.367 --> 53:57.933
he still hasn't made
anything right by me.

53:57.935 --> 53:59.468
I spent thousands
of dollars, you know,

53:59.470 --> 54:01.337
just for the trip,

54:01.339 --> 54:05.541
the letter translations
and photos.

54:05.543 --> 54:08.577
Thousands of dollars
out of pocket for this.

54:08.579 --> 54:11.947
All I can say is that
we worry about us.

54:11.949 --> 54:13.582
We worry about
a foreign affair,

54:13.584 --> 54:15.417
and we always try to do

54:15.419 --> 54:17.786
the best we possibly can
for our clients.

54:17.788 --> 54:19.288
We always try to act ethically.

54:19.290 --> 54:20.489
If we find a problem,

54:20.491 --> 54:22.391
we try to work to
resolve the problem.

54:22.393 --> 54:23.626
There's always
gonna be problems,

54:23.628 --> 54:25.995
but I think the measure
of the company

54:25.997 --> 54:27.896
is how the company
deals with the problems.

54:30.968 --> 54:36.272
Well, I'm in vienna right now.

54:36.274 --> 54:38.974
We'll be boarding here
shortly, going to Odessa.

54:38.976 --> 54:42.311
Pretty excited.

54:42.313 --> 54:43.946
Can't wait to see you, vica.

54:46.684 --> 54:48.617
Many people just assume

54:48.619 --> 54:50.653
that women from other countries

54:50.655 --> 54:53.789
are just looking to get into
America for a green card.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.691
And after money.

54:55.693 --> 54:57.693
I believe there might be a few
people out there like that.

54:57.695 --> 54:59.495
But I think the majority
of the people

54:59.497 --> 55:02.698
that actually going through the
process are fairly serious.

55:02.700 --> 55:05.000
They're looking for love.

55:08.406 --> 55:09.405
Hello.

55:09.407 --> 55:11.740
Pretty!

55:11.742 --> 55:14.610
Look what vica made me.
Balloons.

55:17.948 --> 55:20.449
Vica. Vica wash clothes.

55:20.451 --> 55:23.352
No, no. Please, no.

55:25.423 --> 55:27.656
I disgusting here, okay?

55:27.658 --> 55:28.991
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

55:34.031 --> 55:38.801
Well, this is my
third day here with vica.

55:38.803 --> 55:42.771
I don't know what to say.

55:42.773 --> 55:44.773
Not quite as I expected,
you know.

55:44.775 --> 55:48.410
I thought everything
would be hunky-dory,

55:48.412 --> 55:52.414
and I think everything's
gonna be all right.

55:52.416 --> 55:55.684
I guess I...

55:55.686 --> 55:58.620
For some reason, something
just doesn't seem right,

55:58.622 --> 56:02.524
but I think everything's
gonna be all right.

56:02.526 --> 56:03.992
I, uh...

56:05.796 --> 56:08.397
I guess
I don't know what to say.

56:16.040 --> 56:18.073
On the last day,
early in the morning,

56:18.075 --> 56:20.109
somebody was banging
on the windows.

56:20.111 --> 56:21.577
One was a police officer.

56:21.579 --> 56:24.113
The other one was a loan shark.

56:24.115 --> 56:26.415
The police officer explained

56:26.417 --> 56:29.118
that she owed 4,000,

56:29.120 --> 56:33.122
and he said if we
didn't pay it right away,

56:33.124 --> 56:34.890
she'd have to go to jail.

56:34.892 --> 56:37.159
And I said, well,
I don't have 4,000.

56:37.161 --> 56:40.462
He said, well,
what do you have?

56:40.464 --> 56:42.531
I said, well, I have
a couple hundred bucks.

56:42.533 --> 56:44.967
And he said, if you give us
a couple hundred dollars,

56:44.969 --> 56:46.468
we won't put her in jail.

56:46.470 --> 56:47.936
So I just kind of
agreed with him

56:47.938 --> 56:51.707
to make sure that I would
get to the airport on time.

56:51.709 --> 56:55.110
I was hoping
to formally get engaged,

56:55.112 --> 56:58.547
but everything
kind of seemed fishy,

56:58.549 --> 57:00.749
so I decided not to.

57:03.554 --> 57:07.623
It's 4:40 here in brisbane,

57:07.625 --> 57:11.427
and it is 8:41 Ukraine time.

57:11.429 --> 57:14.797
They don't really make
a specific time

57:14.799 --> 57:17.566
for me to chat on Skype,

57:17.568 --> 57:21.136
and that's why I get tired,
really tired,

57:21.138 --> 57:24.506
because I sit long
hours here, you know,

57:24.508 --> 57:26.041
waiting for them to chat to me.

57:26.043 --> 57:28.877
Do you feel like she's
avoiding your calls at all?

57:28.879 --> 57:30.612
- No, I don't think so.
- No?

57:30.614 --> 57:31.914
I don't think so. Uh-uh.

57:31.916 --> 57:35.117
No, when I get through,
she'll talk to me.

57:35.119 --> 57:38.921
How long has it been
since you talked to her?

57:38.923 --> 57:44.560
Not... before the wedding.

57:52.002 --> 57:53.535
Who's this?

57:53.537 --> 57:55.003
Cat. It's Lisa.

57:55.005 --> 57:57.139
My cat.

58:43.554 --> 58:47.189
We all want to believe
in something better.

58:47.191 --> 58:49.725
We want to believe
that it's for real.

58:49.727 --> 58:52.561
We want to believe that
it's gonna work out.

58:52.563 --> 58:56.832
And so this is why
they continue with that,

58:56.834 --> 59:00.302
because they kind of have already
investment and attachment.

59:08.612 --> 59:11.046
I have a Skype
appointment today.

59:11.048 --> 59:13.315
Busy.

59:13.317 --> 59:17.719
Busy. She's busy on the phone.

59:17.721 --> 59:19.655
I'll try again.

59:21.892 --> 59:24.293
I like to be in control.

59:24.295 --> 59:27.195
I like to be
in charge of a situation.

59:27.197 --> 59:29.231
Then I know what I can do,
what's my next step,

59:29.233 --> 59:31.099
and that's how I plan my life.

59:31.101 --> 59:34.836
And I feel like
I cannot control it now

59:34.838 --> 59:36.238
because I've got no means

59:36.240 --> 59:38.307
of communicating
with her properly.

59:38.309 --> 59:40.976
Do you feel like
you're actually married?

59:40.978 --> 59:42.844
That's the worst part.

59:42.846 --> 59:44.813
I don't feel like it, no,

59:44.815 --> 59:46.281
because there's not really

59:46.283 --> 59:49.217
a lot of communication
between us.

59:49.219 --> 59:52.120
There was no intimacy
between us.

59:52.122 --> 59:53.722
What do you mean?

59:53.724 --> 59:56.658
No sex, nothing. Nothing.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:22.184
The fianc�e visa is at
least a six month process,

01:00:22.186 --> 01:00:23.719
sometimes even eight months,

01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:25.887
and during that time,
a lot's gonna happen.

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:28.790
They do a criminal background
check and a medical.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.393
And they're looking for things
like tuberculosis or aids,

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:32.961
things like that
that would prevent her

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:34.243
from coming
to the United States.

01:02:49.066 --> 01:02:52.167
It's everything incredible.

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:53.835
Everything's bigger?

01:02:53.837 --> 01:02:55.370
Bigger, yeah.

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:57.439
Big trucks, big houses,
big supermarkets.

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.040
Big love.

01:02:59.042 --> 01:03:00.375
Yeah.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:08.016
Went to uvalde this weekend

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:14.022
with the main purpose of
introducing inna to my family

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:18.093
and showing her a little bit
of the town where I'm from

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:21.530
and getting her to
actually see and experience

01:03:21.532 --> 01:03:25.367
some of the things I've
been telling her about.

01:03:38.849 --> 01:03:40.816
- You okay?
- Yes.

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:51.259
How did your parents feel
about you coming over here?

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:57.966
What they think, my parents?

01:03:57.968 --> 01:04:00.335
Yeah. Was it... I'm sure
it was very hard for them.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:01.870
Yeah, of course.

01:04:01.872 --> 01:04:07.008
My mom feels sad. Very cry.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:09.344
And when we were
both in Ukraine,

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:14.416
just when we talk about this,

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:15.951
always cry.

01:04:15.953 --> 01:04:18.854
And when I go, it's too much.

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:20.989
It was very difficult,
of course.

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:24.226
I don't imagine that...

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:27.429
I didn't imagine that
it was so difficult.

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:29.431
Oh, I was so backward.

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:31.433
I grew up in a very small town,

01:04:31.435 --> 01:04:34.903
and I was scared to death
of the world.

01:04:34.905 --> 01:04:40.141
I couldn't have gone
to some other country.

01:04:47.451 --> 01:04:50.652
Anyone that would
make the effort

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:52.420
to come to the United States

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:55.557
from a country like Ukraine,

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:57.659
it's gotta be hard.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:05.400
Something really driving
them to want to do that,

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:09.404
to leave behind
their family, the home,

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:12.540
the only home they've known,
all the familiarity.

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:19.681
Motivation can be either
positive or negative,

01:05:19.683 --> 01:05:23.151
and, you know, fortunately

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:26.521
all that I've experienced

01:05:26.523 --> 01:05:28.690
that she's here for
all the right reasons.

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:35.530
He's showing us
that video of her family,

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:39.601
our families are not that
much different, you know.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.037
I can see they were doing

01:05:42.039 --> 01:05:43.505
the same kinds of things we do

01:05:43.507 --> 01:05:46.341
and it's kind of
the same place, you know.

01:05:46.343 --> 01:05:50.979
People are more alike
than they are diverse,

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:56.484
so it's kind of
two worlds together.

01:06:00.057 --> 01:06:02.157
It's a very big challenge

01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:06.061
and it will take constant work,

01:06:06.063 --> 01:06:10.265
but so is every other
relationship.

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:17.973
Just as you get older,
you have new challenges,

01:06:17.975 --> 01:06:20.041
but you don't expect it.

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:27.382
I think that people are old enough
to make up their own minds,

01:06:27.384 --> 01:06:29.651
and they should be able
to decide for themselves

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:31.419
what they want to do
with their lives.

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:33.388
It's their business.

01:06:34.992 --> 01:06:38.159
I wouldn't intrude on that
one way or another.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.664
So the flags are up
for Memorial Day,

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.066
which is in about a week.

01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:47.235
I want to take a picture.

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:48.570
With the flags?

01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:50.739
Yeah. Yeah. Just do it quick.

01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:52.507
One, two, three.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:55.276
One of my biggest fears

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:58.313
is this whole thing
not working out.

01:06:58.315 --> 01:07:00.648
To me, this is for life,

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.018
and that's what I'm
certainly hoping for

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:07.789
and doing everything I know to
see that that's how it goes.

01:07:48.331 --> 01:07:50.465
All I can say,

01:07:50.467 --> 01:07:54.636
I'm going to give it
my best shot now.

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:58.173
I don't care what people say.

01:07:58.175 --> 01:08:00.842
I'm going to give it
my best fucking shot.

01:08:03.513 --> 01:08:06.748
Even if it means to you
moving to Ukraine

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:09.217
and fucking leave
my fucking lovely life

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:11.786
there in Australia
behind, fuck that.

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:14.255
I can have the same life here.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:17.225
But I feel
I want to be with them,

01:08:17.227 --> 01:08:19.127
with svitlana and the kids.

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:21.796
That's it, and I'm gonna do it.

01:10:28.959 --> 01:10:31.559
- Hi.
- You look so beautiful.

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.895
Oh, thank you. I love you.

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:35.763
I love you so much.

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:38.233
- I love you.
- I miss you.

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:45.840
So together forever,
so together.

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:50.612
Together forever. Yes.
Together forever.

01:10:50.614 --> 01:10:51.846
Where you at, in Kiev?

01:10:51.848 --> 01:10:56.251
Yes. Home tomorrow. Tomorrow.

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:57.485
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

01:10:57.487 --> 01:11:00.421
- Back to nikolayev?
- Yes.

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:51.959
So how do you feel?

01:15:54.584 --> 01:15:57.184
What's happening today?

01:15:57.186 --> 01:16:03.190
Today we're going to
the justice of the peace

01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:07.662
for our legal marriage.

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:48.663
Eric and inna.
Okay, here we go.

01:17:48.665 --> 01:17:51.432
Greetings
to friends and family.

01:17:51.434 --> 01:17:52.833
We're gathered here today

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:54.735
to celebrate the lives
of Eric and inna,

01:17:54.737 --> 01:17:56.771
who will now be joined
in marriage.

01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:58.072
Now, their marriage

01:17:58.074 --> 01:18:00.441
will be the intertwining
of two life stories.

01:18:00.443 --> 01:18:02.443
As individuals,
they bring to the marriage

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:04.078
their own unique history

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.213
as they choose to set aside
the single life

01:18:06.215 --> 01:18:08.315
and unite as one.

01:18:08.317 --> 01:18:10.918
Eric, do you take this woman

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:14.321
to be your lawfully wedded
wife, to have and to hold,

01:18:14.323 --> 01:18:16.257
richer or poorer,
sickness and health

01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:17.391
till death due you part?

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:18.459
I do.

01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:19.927
Inna, do you take this man

01:18:19.929 --> 01:18:21.262
to be your lawfully
wedded husband,

01:18:21.264 --> 01:18:23.764
to have, to hold,
for richer, for poorer,

01:18:23.766 --> 01:18:25.366
sickness and health,
till death due you part?

01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:27.034
- I do.
- There you go.

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:30.004
So by virtue of the authority
vested in me by law

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:31.806
as justice of the peace
precinct 2,

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:33.340
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:18:33.342 --> 01:18:34.975
You may kiss the bride.

01:18:43.086 --> 01:18:47.021
Oh, that's sweet.

01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:08.008
She's here already.

01:19:08.010 --> 01:19:10.811
She's here. She must
have started early.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.142
You can stand a little bit.

01:19:48.484 --> 01:19:51.051
Translator: Sorry, Michael.
Please don't get offended.

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:53.954
It's just that I don't
like the dead flowers

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:58.159
and I told you before that
I like the live flowers...

01:19:58.161 --> 01:20:00.828
I didn't know that...

01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:04.165
she said I shouldn't
buy her flowers,

01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:07.234
but I never knew
the reason behind it.

01:20:10.039 --> 01:20:14.875
Translator: She had
orchids on her wedding.

01:20:14.877 --> 01:20:18.345
The wedding was decorated
with orchids.

01:20:22.084 --> 01:20:23.584
Oh, well.

01:20:23.586 --> 01:20:25.853
It was a very beautiful...

01:20:25.855 --> 01:20:28.155
these were
very beautiful decorations

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:29.824
and everything
was very beautiful,

01:20:29.826 --> 01:20:31.992
but anyway,
this was a big mistake.

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:33.360
What?

01:20:38.835 --> 01:20:40.534
- The wedding was a mistake.
- Hmm?

01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:41.902
The wedding was a mistake.

01:20:41.904 --> 01:20:43.037
The wedding was a mistake?

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:46.440
Why did she wait
all this time then

01:20:46.442 --> 01:20:49.076
to tell me only now?

01:20:49.078 --> 01:20:50.611
She says that the only email

01:20:50.613 --> 01:20:53.080
that she sent to you
after the wedding,

01:20:53.082 --> 01:20:54.949
actually said

01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:58.586
that she doesn't want
to continue any longer.

01:20:58.588 --> 01:21:02.389
No, no, no, no, no, no. Mm-mm.

01:21:02.391 --> 01:21:04.391
I actually remember
that email now.

01:21:04.393 --> 01:21:08.996
She was saying she don't know.
She's very unsure of herself.

01:21:08.998 --> 01:21:11.398
She was very unsure of herself.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.467
That's what she was saying.

01:21:19.508 --> 01:21:22.509
But she won't be able
to be your wife,

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:27.448
and actually it's time to quit
this interview because I don't...

01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:31.051
no, no, no, no,
it's not over yet.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:34.889
Let's think about it.

01:21:37.026 --> 01:21:40.461
No, no, let me...
let me... let me...

01:21:40.463 --> 01:21:42.062
let me explain.

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:43.264
You're not going anywhere

01:21:43.266 --> 01:21:46.066
until we sorted this thing out.

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:48.402
If you don't like a person
from the first start,

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:50.638
you should not get
involved in relations.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.307
Not even get married
to that person.

01:21:53.309 --> 01:21:56.443
That is totally not on

01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:59.446
to get the person
to take you to Bali,

01:21:59.448 --> 01:22:02.116
get married to them,
and then afterwards,

01:22:02.118 --> 01:22:04.685
you just disappear,
you just get quiet.

01:22:04.687 --> 01:22:07.922
You know what, I just feel

01:22:07.924 --> 01:22:10.391
like I've been used by her.

01:22:10.393 --> 01:22:12.459
That's all I feel now.

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:16.330
And maybe that email that I got

01:22:16.332 --> 01:22:18.933
from that alexy is right,

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:21.468
that you just
use people like me

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:26.273
to just get your kicks

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:27.608
for a cheap holiday.

01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:31.011
Can I have my ring back?

01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:37.451
It's already here.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:38.519
Where?

01:22:40.022 --> 01:22:43.490
It's in the...
Near the flowers.

01:22:43.492 --> 01:22:44.692
Can I go now?

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:47.695
Okay. Goodbye.

01:22:47.697 --> 01:22:49.496
Okay. Goodbye.

01:22:57.273 --> 01:23:00.107
It doesn't make sense, really.

01:23:00.109 --> 01:23:02.009
So what are you going to do?

01:23:02.011 --> 01:23:04.244
Well, get the fuck out of here.

01:23:04.246 --> 01:23:07.114
So what else can I do, huh?

01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:11.211
At the end of
"the wizard of oz,".

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:14.181
Dorothy says
something like this,

01:24:14.183 --> 01:24:16.350
I've learned that
if what I'm looking for

01:24:16.352 --> 01:24:18.118
is not in my own backyard,

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.254
then I didn't need it anyway.

01:24:20.256 --> 01:24:25.092
So I've learned
some appreciation

01:24:25.094 --> 01:24:27.127
for the women back at home.

01:24:27.129 --> 01:24:29.129
I'm dating a woman now,

01:24:29.131 --> 01:24:31.465
and we actually dated before
I went to the Ukraine.

01:24:31.467 --> 01:24:33.333
And then we broke up

01:24:33.335 --> 01:24:37.104
and I think I had
some areas in my life

01:24:37.106 --> 01:24:38.806
that I needed to give on.

01:24:38.808 --> 01:24:41.341
I think she has some that
she needed to give on.

01:24:41.343 --> 01:24:43.444
A special person like that

01:24:43.446 --> 01:24:45.412
doesn't come around
but so often.

01:25:00.863 --> 01:25:03.764
After all this, I got
depressed for a while.

01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:08.202
It really, definitely
affected me.

01:25:08.204 --> 01:25:09.369
I sat around.

01:25:09.371 --> 01:25:13.440
I actually went and got
some bupropion

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:15.676
to help with that.

01:25:15.678 --> 01:25:17.177
Finally worked through it.

01:25:17.179 --> 01:25:19.413
Pretty much stopped
trying to date,

01:25:19.415 --> 01:25:22.282
anything like that
until just recently.

01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:24.651
I figured I might try it
one more time.

01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:26.520
This is her, huh?

01:25:26.522 --> 01:25:28.755
Yeah. This is becka.

01:25:30.126 --> 01:25:32.693
It's not the same as Julia.

01:25:32.695 --> 01:25:34.728
I'm getting personal responses

01:25:34.730 --> 01:25:37.698
and actual, you know,

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.333
it looks like someone's
actually putting some thought

01:25:39.335 --> 01:25:40.834
into the email.

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:45.339
Do you ever just feel like
you're just writing a photo?

01:25:47.843 --> 01:25:50.777
Yeah.

01:25:52.548 --> 01:25:55.549
Would you say you're
in love with vica?

01:25:55.551 --> 01:25:57.351
Right now I don't know.

01:25:57.353 --> 01:25:59.386
I thought I was,

01:25:59.388 --> 01:26:04.725
and then...

01:26:04.727 --> 01:26:07.561
It's this money thing.

01:26:07.563 --> 01:26:09.530
It's completely the money.

01:26:09.532 --> 01:26:12.833
If it wasn't for the money,
there'd be no doubt.

01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:20.340
It seems like it's gotten
worse after this last trip

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:22.409
as far as asking for money.

01:26:22.411 --> 01:26:24.912
I don't... I told her,

01:26:24.914 --> 01:26:27.514
no more after this last trip.

01:26:27.516 --> 01:26:31.585
I'm to the point
I'm just fed up with it

01:26:31.587 --> 01:26:33.754
because if we weren't going
through the visa process,

01:26:33.756 --> 01:26:36.390
there's no way I'd
keep going on with it.

01:26:43.499 --> 01:26:46.266
There was no fear
of getting married

01:26:46.268 --> 01:26:50.737
and marrying vita like,
you know, the jitters,

01:26:50.739 --> 01:26:52.573
the pre-wedding jitters.

01:26:52.575 --> 01:26:55.509
There was none of that.

01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:56.810
This is what I wanted

01:26:56.812 --> 01:26:59.880
was someone to spend
the rest of my life with.

01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:01.348
Robert...

01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:02.649
Robert...

01:27:02.651 --> 01:27:04.218
Today I give...

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.285
Today I give...

01:27:05.287 --> 01:27:06.954
- My love...
- My love...

01:27:06.956 --> 01:27:08.989
- To you.
- To you.

01:27:23.305 --> 01:27:25.706
Most people think it's
the guy going over there

01:27:25.708 --> 01:27:27.808
and they pick the woman.

01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:29.910
They're not waiting
to be picked.

01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:32.512
They want the same relationship

01:27:32.514 --> 01:27:36.016
that every other woman wants.

01:27:36.018 --> 01:27:38.652
They don't want just anybody.

01:27:38.654 --> 01:27:41.455
They want someone
that's right for them.

01:27:41.457 --> 01:27:44.558
I'm a reasonable person

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.027
and he is, too.

01:27:47.029 --> 01:27:51.698
And I always know that
I need to have man

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:54.868
who I will respect.

01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:58.338
It's a very good feeling

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:01.942
when you think...
when you wake up

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:04.711
and think how I love here.

01:28:04.713 --> 01:28:07.914
It's very good.

01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:09.883
I've seen things in Eric

01:28:09.885 --> 01:28:13.920
that I've never seen before
when he's with inna.

01:28:13.922 --> 01:28:16.690
He's always been
thoughtful and kind,

01:28:16.692 --> 01:28:21.762
but more attentive, more aware.

01:28:21.764 --> 01:28:23.997
This year I got
a mother's day email

01:28:23.999 --> 01:28:25.999
with pictures from them.

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:29.336
He'd never sent
a mother's day card.

01:28:29.338 --> 01:28:30.804
Things are awakening in him

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:34.741
that he's never
had to think of.

01:28:34.743 --> 01:28:36.576
Your mother and father told us

01:28:36.578 --> 01:28:39.346
about a big development.

01:28:39.348 --> 01:28:41.982
Oh, yeah?

01:28:41.984 --> 01:28:43.784
Yeah, that is true.

01:28:43.786 --> 01:28:45.652
What is it?

01:28:45.654 --> 01:28:48.622
Pregnant. I'm pregnant.

01:28:48.624 --> 01:28:51.091
About four months.

01:28:51.093 --> 01:28:54.995
I have family,
what I always imagined.

01:28:54.997 --> 01:28:59.099
I'm so happy for him
to have somebody,

01:28:59.101 --> 01:29:01.501
somebody to be with,

01:29:01.503 --> 01:29:04.638
somebody to do things with,

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.773
somebody to love.

01:29:06.775 --> 01:29:11.111
You need somebody to love
and to love you.

01:29:11.113 --> 01:29:13.613
John: Guys, it'll never
ever happen

01:29:13.615 --> 01:29:15.115
just sitting on your couch,

01:29:15.117 --> 01:29:17.584
whether you go with us
or you go with someone else

01:29:17.586 --> 01:29:19.686
or you, I don't care,
get on a plane

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:21.021
and just go
over there yourself.

01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:24.024
Put yourself in an opportunity
to meet someone.

01:29:24.026 --> 01:29:26.493
Rob, will, everybody,
thank you very much.

01:29:26.495 --> 01:29:27.694
Yes. Thanks for having us.

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:29.029
And we will see you
in just two weeks

01:29:29.031 --> 01:29:31.998
with another great show.
So until then, bye-bye.

01:29:35.371 --> 01:29:38.505
What is love?

01:29:40.642 --> 01:29:42.075
Love.

01:29:48.951 --> 01:29:51.385
I will start to cry.

01:29:57.826 --> 01:30:01.962
Love is when you can say

01:30:01.964 --> 01:30:05.098
that I will just give
my life for somebody.

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:07.601
I think that's love.

01:30:10.105 --> 01:30:12.606
How does one find love?

01:30:16.779 --> 01:30:18.645
I don't know.

01:30:18.647 --> 01:30:22.816
I think you have to be
lucky to find it.

01:30:22.818 --> 01:30:25.419
You have to keep looking

01:30:25.421 --> 01:30:28.555
and if you are lucky,
you will find it.

01:30:28.557 --> 01:30:31.758
If not, some people
will never find it.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:36.730
So you just need
to keep looking.
