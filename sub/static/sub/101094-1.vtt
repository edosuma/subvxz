[fire crackling]

00:11.788 --> 00:14.389
I used to think
being born a Sinclair

00:14.391 --> 00:15.792
was the best thing that ever
happened to me.

00:17.394 --> 00:18.526
There were rumors about us

00:18.528 --> 00:20.097
and I always thought
they were just jealous.

00:22.766 --> 00:24.900
They say Grandpa August
was a monster,

00:24.902 --> 00:27.671
that he was the richest man
in history.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.106
I always thought
he was the cheapest.

00:31.108 --> 00:32.875
[thunder rumbling]

00:32.877 --> 00:34.442
I think I convinced myself
that...

00:34.444 --> 00:35.543
[scoffs]

00:35.545 --> 00:37.378
I could actually be happy
being a Sinclair.

[Geraldine] This is Geraldine
calling again from St. Paul's.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.701
There's been an incident
at the school

02:39.703 --> 02:41.771
and we have been trying
to reach you all night.

02:43.174 --> 02:44.605
If you could please

02:44.607 --> 02:46.574
[panting]

02:51.349 --> 02:53.248
Um...

02:53.250 --> 02:55.184
I'm sorry about that, uh...

02:55.186 --> 02:56.786
[Geraldine]
If you could please just...

02:57.955 --> 03:00.057
give us a call back when
you get a chance.

03:02.093 --> 03:03.060
Thank you.

03:03.660 --> 03:05.493
[phone clatters]

03:05.495 --> 03:06.494
- [thuds]
- [groans]

03:06.496 --> 03:08.897
Uh-uh-uh. No, no, no.

03:08.899 --> 03:10.765
Get up, I need you to
take care of Luck.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.901
- Oh, come on.
- [June] Get up, out of bed.

03:12.903 --> 03:14.502
I have, like, stuff to do.

03:14.504 --> 03:15.772
[June] Such as?

03:17.475 --> 03:19.110
This is pretty good
for right now.

03:20.878 --> 03:21.946
[sighs]

03:26.616 --> 03:28.252
You gonna tell me why
you attacked that girl?

03:32.890 --> 03:36.325
It's a miracle
it's only a one-day suspension.

03:36.327 --> 03:38.861
The school called
Grandpa August's place

03:38.863 --> 03:40.031
in the middle of dinner.

03:41.798 --> 03:44.133
Uncle November thought
it was pretty impressive.

03:44.135 --> 03:45.635
He didn't think
you had it in you.

03:48.272 --> 03:49.606
How was last night?

03:50.707 --> 03:52.143
Oh, same as every year.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.246
And we have to go back and...

03:56.780 --> 03:59.316
work on this business plan
for next year.

04:01.452 --> 04:02.752
So you need to look after Luck.

04:03.620 --> 04:04.786
Have fun!

04:04.788 --> 04:06.157
[June] Hmm.

04:07.757 --> 04:10.192
Aunty A says she's sorry

04:10.194 --> 04:11.692
- she missed your birthday.
- [Chance] Mm-hmm.

04:11.694 --> 04:12.760
She gave me
your birthday present.

04:12.762 --> 04:14.231
It's downstairs
on the kitchen...

04:15.266 --> 04:16.166
counter.

04:20.237 --> 04:21.137
[Chance] Luckster.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.207
[Chance] Dad. Hey.

04:24.707 --> 04:26.275
[June] Read the card first.

04:26.277 --> 04:28.811
And don't you have something
to say to her?

04:28.813 --> 04:31.146
Fighting? Suspension?

04:31.148 --> 04:32.281
I head-butted her.

04:32.283 --> 04:33.650
[present rustling]

04:36.220 --> 04:39.290
What the heck is this?

04:40.524 --> 04:41.824
She got me a letter opener?

04:41.826 --> 04:43.225
Uh, please be careful,
don't touch the blade.

04:43.227 --> 04:45.626
- [blade rasps]
- [Chance] Damn, that's sharp!

04:45.628 --> 04:47.762
I can't believe
she bought this for you.

04:47.764 --> 04:49.565
- Dec, we gotta get going.
- [Chance groans]

04:49.567 --> 04:50.698
Uh...

04:50.700 --> 04:52.034
Uh, don't forget
your transfusions.

04:52.036 --> 04:53.902
It's supposed to be
really sunny today.

04:53.904 --> 04:55.938
So make sure you stay away
from the windows.

04:55.940 --> 04:58.140
Luck needs to be in bed
by 8:00 p.m.

04:58.142 --> 04:59.108
- [Luck] Where are you going?
- No later, okay?

04:59.110 --> 05:01.310
Mom, take Luck with you,
she'd love it.

05:01.312 --> 05:04.046
Love you. Be good. Please.

05:04.048 --> 05:06.183
- Bye, sweetie.
- [Luck] Bye.

05:15.559 --> 05:16.961
[rustling]

05:23.167 --> 05:24.902
You're going to have
to start doing this soon.

05:25.702 --> 05:27.805
Stupid adorable baby.

05:28.771 --> 05:30.372
Stupid baby.

05:30.374 --> 05:32.574
What? No, don't say that.

05:32.576 --> 05:34.576
[cell phone rings]

05:34.578 --> 05:35.911
- [ringing continues]
- [scoffs]

05:35.913 --> 05:37.012
[June] <i>Hey sweetie,</i>

05:37.014 --> 05:38.315
<i>looks like we're gonna have
to stay the night.</i>

05:39.183 --> 05:40.117
Mom!

05:40.951 --> 05:42.251
You sound stressed.

05:42.253 --> 05:45.888
[June] <i>Yeah, your father's
new business plan</i>

05:45.890 --> 05:47.556
<i>is the work of a lunatic.</i>

05:47.558 --> 05:48.991
<i>Hey, is Luck asleep?</i>

05:48.993 --> 05:50.392
<i>In bed, right?</i>

05:50.394 --> 05:51.860
Oh yes, she's sound asleep.

05:51.862 --> 05:53.061
[June] <i>Uh-huh.</i>

05:53.063 --> 05:55.430
<i>Make sure she's not watching
any scary movies,</i>

05:55.432 --> 05:56.666
<i>I don't want nightmares.</i>

05:57.601 --> 05:59.234
[June sighs] <i>Love you.</i>

05:59.236 --> 06:01.837
- Love you, too.
- [June] <i>Bye.</i>

06:01.839 --> 06:03.908
[suspenseful music
playing on TV]

06:07.845 --> 06:08.979
[brakes screech]

06:16.453 --> 06:17.754
[door creaks, clicks]

06:19.623 --> 06:21.290
Mornin', Chance.

06:21.292 --> 06:22.891
Where's your coat?

06:22.893 --> 06:24.860
Mom said
you had lunch money for me?

06:24.862 --> 06:25.963
What, are you kidding me?

06:26.931 --> 06:29.333
Uh, let's see.

06:31.768 --> 06:32.903
Ah.

06:33.671 --> 06:34.903
Yeah, yeah.

06:34.905 --> 06:36.941
All right, I'll pay you
not to get suspended today.

06:38.242 --> 06:39.410
Let's go.

06:41.345 --> 06:42.246
Come on, honey.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.984
[upbeat music]

06:50.654 --> 06:52.056
[marker rasping]

06:52.722 --> 06:53.589
[teacher] Um...

06:53.591 --> 06:56.191
<i>Le bourgeoisie
a perdu toute sa pertinence.</i>

06:56.193 --> 06:58.093
What this means
is that the bourgeoisie lost

06:58.095 --> 07:00.295
- [chuckles]
- all hope with the people.

07:00.297 --> 07:04.499
So if you compare
this to what he said in 1892...

07:04.501 --> 07:07.236
[Sabine] Listen up,
you disabled lesbian slut.

07:07.238 --> 07:09.871
My dad is going
to sue you so fast,

07:09.873 --> 07:12.274
you and your freak family
will be begging us

07:12.276 --> 07:14.243
to take you outback
and put you down

07:14.245 --> 07:17.081
like the disgusting
tasty ass-dogs you are.

07:18.249 --> 07:19.715
You speak like that to me again

07:19.717 --> 07:21.352
and I'll smash
your two front teeth in.

07:22.486 --> 07:25.320
Oh wait,
I did that already, didn't I?

07:25.322 --> 07:26.257
Mm.

07:27.891 --> 07:29.658
[Sabine] Chance said the N-word.

07:29.660 --> 07:31.794
[class mutters]

07:38.469 --> 07:40.936
- [June] <i>We need eleven more.</i>
- [August] Good.

07:40.938 --> 07:43.872
So, November and February
should make up that.

07:43.874 --> 07:45.974
Those aren't
the type of souls we want.

07:45.976 --> 07:49.011
They're preying on addicts
and weak people.

07:49.013 --> 07:51.446
We need...
we need the type of souls

07:51.448 --> 07:53.250
that your father wants
us to collect.

07:54.018 --> 07:55.853
[August] Says who? You?

07:56.954 --> 08:00.422
I am just following
our doctrine.

08:00.424 --> 08:02.491
Who's the head of this family,
June?

08:02.493 --> 08:05.694
We're serving
a greater purpose, father!

08:05.696 --> 08:07.398
Who's the head of this family?

08:08.532 --> 08:10.200
[phone ringing]

08:11.735 --> 08:14.603
[ringing continues]

08:14.605 --> 08:17.072
[students muttering in distance]

08:17.074 --> 08:19.207
There's been an incident
at the school.

08:19.209 --> 08:21.011
Yeah, no, that's fine.
I'll be right there.

08:22.646 --> 08:25.349
She isn't to speak to any police
until we're present.

08:28.919 --> 08:30.020
[phone clatters]

08:31.655 --> 08:32.856
[thuds]

08:37.094 --> 08:39.229
[approaching footsteps]

08:41.432 --> 08:42.599
[June sniffs]

08:45.202 --> 08:47.636
Now, is as good a time as any

08:47.638 --> 08:49.006
to talk about the other things.

08:50.307 --> 08:52.042
[June] We're tired, father.

08:53.812 --> 08:55.279
This will be our last harvest.

08:58.615 --> 09:03.385
No child of mine
has ever left the family.

09:03.387 --> 09:06.390
Then let me succeed you as
the head of House Sinclair.

09:07.658 --> 09:09.560
Let me lead or let us walk.

09:10.594 --> 09:11.929
Here's the deal.

09:14.231 --> 09:15.864
A hundred more harvests.

09:15.866 --> 09:17.099
No.

09:17.101 --> 09:18.467
- [August] Fifty.
- No.

09:18.469 --> 09:19.603
One.

09:21.305 --> 09:22.839
And?

09:22.841 --> 09:24.308
And I get Chance.

09:27.077 --> 09:29.279
She's a full-blooded Sinclair.

09:30.614 --> 09:32.516
[August] She doesn't know
her own strength.

09:33.517 --> 09:35.085
And she is soon to know

09:35.953 --> 09:38.053
that the ruse that she has, uh,

09:38.055 --> 09:40.557
a genetic defect is a lie.

09:41.892 --> 09:43.994
[somber music]

09:45.262 --> 09:49.030
One more harvest,
and your firstborn,

09:49.032 --> 09:51.135
and you two can have
your freedom.

09:59.410 --> 10:01.311
[ominous music]

10:04.014 --> 10:06.314
I really did only touch her.

10:06.316 --> 10:08.250
And she always bitched about
wanting a nose job,

10:08.252 --> 10:09.620
so she got her wish.

10:11.555 --> 10:12.656
Mom?

10:13.724 --> 10:15.626
[ominous music]

10:34.344 --> 10:36.447
[ominous music continues]

10:43.687 --> 10:44.721
[thuds]

10:49.560 --> 10:50.461
Why are we here?

10:51.462 --> 10:52.563
What's going on?

10:54.731 --> 10:56.631
No. No.

10:56.633 --> 10:57.734
[door creaks]

10:59.670 --> 11:00.737
No.

11:01.572 --> 11:02.606
Hell no.

11:04.441 --> 11:06.843
Mom, I'm sorry.
I get it, I messed up.

11:06.845 --> 11:08.011
It's not your fault.

11:09.046 --> 11:10.312
What does that even mean?

11:10.314 --> 11:12.683
It means things are complicated.

11:14.819 --> 11:16.151
This isn't fair.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.454
It'll do you some good.

11:18.622 --> 11:20.422
Grandpa August
is a mean son of a bitch,

11:20.424 --> 11:22.526
but he's smart.
You can learn from him.

11:25.562 --> 11:27.631
How long am I gonna
be living here for?

11:31.034 --> 11:32.135
We'll see.

11:33.604 --> 11:35.205
[Chance]
What about when I need checkups?

11:36.106 --> 11:38.039
What about school?

11:38.041 --> 11:40.108
What about my friends?

11:40.110 --> 11:42.077
Is there even reception here?

11:42.079 --> 11:44.179
I don't even have Wi-Fi.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.481
I'm 17, this is my life.

11:46.483 --> 11:47.917
- [thuds]
- This is kidnapping!

11:47.919 --> 11:48.985
- This is...
- Homeschooling

11:48.987 --> 11:50.619
is not kidnapping.

11:50.621 --> 11:53.522
Exactly, homeschooling,

11:53.524 --> 11:56.458
not "let's force Chance to live
with Grandpa August".

11:56.460 --> 11:58.961
It won't be all that bad.

11:58.963 --> 12:01.596
Your mother and I think
it's a good idea to get away

12:01.598 --> 12:04.101
from city distractions
for a while.

12:05.168 --> 12:08.639
And 18 is a big year
for a Sinclair.

12:09.706 --> 12:10.674
No.

12:11.441 --> 12:12.942
Dad?

12:12.944 --> 12:14.044
Back me up.

12:15.847 --> 12:17.546
Dad!

12:17.548 --> 12:18.448
[smooches]

12:20.885 --> 12:23.554
I know it's a confusing time
for a young woman.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.489
Changes in your body.

12:27.491 --> 12:30.592
- Puberty.
- Oh, god!

12:30.594 --> 12:33.762
Please kill me
before you finish that sentence.

12:33.764 --> 12:36.667
You watch how you speak to me,
young lady.

12:39.336 --> 12:42.606
Now, let's make the best of it.

12:44.575 --> 12:48.044
We treat it like,
uh, a mini prep school.

12:48.046 --> 12:49.578
Mini-prison?

12:49.580 --> 12:50.681
Oh, okay.

12:52.616 --> 12:56.384
You are free to go anytime
you want, young lady,

12:56.386 --> 12:58.921
but then
I might have to write you out.

12:58.923 --> 13:00.221
Of what?

13:00.223 --> 13:01.458
Your will?

[somber music]

13:47.805 --> 13:50.407
[somber music continues]

13:56.213 --> 13:58.248
[June] We finally have
our freedom.

14:01.718 --> 14:03.720
All it cost us was
our firstborn.

14:09.192 --> 14:10.560
Next harvest,

14:11.863 --> 14:12.897
we kill him.

14:28.913 --> 14:31.546

14:32.549 --> 14:34.349
<i>if you're running
back home, right?</i>

14:34.351 --> 14:35.918
I can hitchhike back
to Vancouver and say,

14:35.920 --> 14:39.121
"Mom, Dad, I'm sorry,
I'll go to school and..."

14:39.123 --> 14:42.325
[rustling in distance]

14:47.431 --> 14:50.800
If you take another step,
you will never, ever

14:50.802 --> 14:53.169
be able to call yourself
a Sinclair again.

14:53.171 --> 14:56.005
This is why everybody calls
you "the creepy uncle".

14:56.007 --> 14:58.273
[Chance] Lurking around
the forest with...

14:58.275 --> 14:59.875
What is that?

14:59.877 --> 15:01.409
Luxsbane.

15:01.411 --> 15:03.815
[November] It's been in
our family since the first days.

15:05.016 --> 15:07.449
And tradition dictates
that each Sinclair

15:07.451 --> 15:09.684
should learn the power
to wield it.

15:09.686 --> 15:12.287
[Chance] Hey, you know
you're my favorite uncle.

15:12.289 --> 15:14.255
- Right, uncle No-no?
- [chuckles]

15:14.257 --> 15:16.460
[November] Well, I hope you
can fight better than you lie.

15:18.395 --> 15:20.162
I know we're in the shade,
but mom says

15:20.164 --> 15:22.397
I can't be outside in the sun
for more than ten minutes, so...

15:22.399 --> 15:23.999
You know what, that's a lie.

15:24.001 --> 15:26.634
Because it takes an hour
before the Sinclair sunburn

15:26.636 --> 15:28.806
makes you want
to cut your head off.

15:30.440 --> 15:34.776
Being a Sinclair
is all about power, loyalty.

15:34.778 --> 15:38.580
And if you fall in line,
you can wield that power too.

15:38.582 --> 15:40.182
I know Mom and Dad
abandoned me here

15:40.184 --> 15:42.484
so I could learn how
to be all proper and nice,

15:42.486 --> 15:44.719
but this ain't me.

15:44.721 --> 15:46.389
[November] Well, then
what do you think you are?

15:48.860 --> 15:52.327
I don't know. I like design.
I like fashion,

15:52.329 --> 15:54.297
or maybe graphic design.

15:54.966 --> 15:56.531
Okay.

15:56.533 --> 15:59.634

Now, if you want to get out
of this house alive,

16:08.478 --> 16:11.481
you must learn how to win.

16:13.918 --> 16:15.987

16:26.630 --> 16:27.899
[Chance] <i>Who are we?</i>

16:29.733 --> 16:32.234
I have been waiting for you
to ask that question

16:32.236 --> 16:34.005
since you took
your first breath.

16:36.740 --> 16:38.575
[August] The Sinclairs
are gifted.

<i>A purpose.</i>

16:52.322 --> 16:53.490
[Chance] <i>Which is?</i>

16:55.358 --> 16:56.760
[August]
<i>To make the world right.</i>

16:58.229 --> 17:00.530
<i>It gives you the power
over one thing.</i>

17:05.435 --> 17:06.736
<i>Time.</i>

17:08.005 --> 17:10.839
[suspenseful music]

is enough to kill a hundred men.

- Once ingested, how long...

to enter the blood-stream.

26:42.346 --> 26:44.012
Sixty-nine minutes before
the respiratory system

before full cardiac arrest.

27:04.134 --> 27:06.503
You will cook us a most
exquisite meal.

27:07.371 --> 27:08.972
And you will poison the host.

27:10.107 --> 27:11.542
- Who's the host?
- [June] My father.

27:15.078 --> 27:17.045
Or take your time.

27:17.047 --> 27:18.547
However, my husband will start

27:18.549 --> 27:20.817
to cut off bits
of Freddie's face

27:20.819 --> 27:22.017
until you say yes.

27:22.019 --> 27:23.118
[knife rasps]

27:23.120 --> 27:25.253
And after
there is nothing left to tell

27:25.255 --> 27:29.224
between your friend
and a piece of raw meat,

27:29.226 --> 27:32.327
I'll pay
that lovely coffee stall

27:32.329 --> 27:34.963
you like so much a visit, hmm?

27:34.965 --> 27:36.164
Dakota?

27:36.166 --> 27:37.267
Adelaide?

27:40.270 --> 27:42.272
You've got a little crush, huh?

27:43.307 --> 27:45.242
[June] Young love is so cute.

27:46.577 --> 27:48.043
[grunts]

27:48.045 --> 27:49.146
[Syd] Ricin?

27:50.314 --> 27:51.379
Cyanide?

27:51.381 --> 27:52.282
Immune.

27:53.317 --> 27:55.350
That's impossible.

27:55.352 --> 27:59.120
He has quite
a diabolic constitution.

27:59.122 --> 28:00.857
[June] Arch hemlock
is the only choice.

28:00.859 --> 28:02.424
Syd, don't do it, don't!

28:02.426 --> 28:05.694
[June] You think I'm a monster
for asking you to do this?

28:05.696 --> 28:09.132
I need to save my family
at any cost.

28:13.570 --> 28:14.471
I'll do it.

28:17.774 --> 28:19.676
[foreboding music]

28:25.549 --> 28:26.983
[June] Mickey will keep an eye

28:26.985 --> 28:27.716
- on Freddie.
- [Freddie sighs]

28:27.718 --> 28:29.751
[June] I'm sure they have
plenty of old war stories

28:29.753 --> 28:30.654
to catch up on.

28:31.755 --> 28:32.756
Hey, Luck,

28:34.024 --> 28:35.858
Cousin Mickey,

28:35.860 --> 28:38.159
she's going to be hangin' out
with you tonight, okay?

28:38.161 --> 28:39.530
You listen to her, okay?

28:40.564 --> 28:42.099
- [Luck] Okay.
- [June] Be good.

28:48.605 --> 28:50.507
[foreboding music]

29:04.121 --> 29:06.824
Deep breaths. Take a second
to get used to the air here.

29:14.197 --> 29:16.300
[foreboding music]

29:17.501 --> 29:19.434
[August] Oh, look, who it is!

29:19.436 --> 29:20.604
[laughs]

29:21.738 --> 29:23.206
How's my family?

29:25.375 --> 29:27.377
Let the games begin, huh?

29:27.812 --> 29:28.712
Well...

29:30.915 --> 29:33.114
Razor won the fight, huh?

29:33.116 --> 29:35.116
And June, you look thin.

29:35.118 --> 29:36.651
Everything okay?

29:36.653 --> 29:39.588
- Father.
- [August] Give your daddy a hug.

29:39.590 --> 29:41.091
- Oh!
- [June chuckling]

29:43.962 --> 29:45.727
And let me guess.

29:45.729 --> 29:48.296
This must be The Chef.

29:48.298 --> 29:51.199
June said very high things
about you.

29:51.201 --> 29:52.369
[August] It's a pleasure.

29:53.037 --> 29:54.569
A real pleasure.

29:54.571 --> 29:57.272
You have an expensive-looking
home, Mr. Sinclair.

29:57.274 --> 30:00.775
Oh, so might as well
be a shoebox to me.

30:00.777 --> 30:04.446
Look, why don't you two
say hello to Chance?

30:04.448 --> 30:05.915
She's a bit moody.

30:05.917 --> 30:08.552
Myself and the Chef need
to do a little chat.

30:11.622 --> 30:13.788
[August] I love my garden, I do.

30:13.790 --> 30:18.126
I had a tomato patch going
and some green peas over there.

30:18.128 --> 30:21.964
You know, I don't envy now
the task you have ahead of you.

30:21.966 --> 30:24.635
I want tonight's meal
to be life-affirming.

30:25.903 --> 30:27.237
[Syd] I will do my best.

30:28.705 --> 30:30.472
[August] I appreciate
the honesty.

30:30.474 --> 30:31.775
It's best to be honest.

30:34.311 --> 30:37.980
Yet life sometimes calls
for dishonesty.

30:37.982 --> 30:42.352
Such as when a wife asks you
if you enjoy her cooking.

30:43.186 --> 30:45.553
Or if I were to ask you,

30:45.555 --> 30:47.324
"Are you here to poison me?"

30:50.460 --> 30:52.995
It's okay, I'm only joking.

30:52.997 --> 30:54.564
So tell me about yourself.

30:55.265 --> 30:57.332
Enlighten me.

30:57.334 --> 30:59.534
My name
is Sydney Francis Lawson.

30:59.536 --> 31:02.938
I am 24 years old
and I like to cook.

31:02.940 --> 31:04.741
My father taught me the basics.

31:05.442 --> 31:07.843
He must be proud of you.

31:07.845 --> 31:10.378
[Syd] He said I'm an
embarrassment to my family.

31:10.380 --> 31:11.881
That's funny.

31:11.883 --> 31:14.217
My father said
the same thing about me.

31:16.154 --> 31:17.752
What did you do about it?

31:17.754 --> 31:20.390
I got angry and then
I forgave him.

31:21.358 --> 31:22.659
And he gave me this.

31:24.327 --> 31:25.495
Come inside.

31:27.965 --> 31:28.866
[August] <i>Can you
read this?</i>

31:30.935 --> 31:32.667
Alright.

31:32.669 --> 31:35.938
We'll have a blue cheese
and steak crostini

31:35.940 --> 31:37.272
for the appetizer.

31:37.274 --> 31:38.373
And then, later on,

31:38.375 --> 31:40.677
we'll have ribs
with a tamarind glaze.

31:44.849 --> 31:46.283
And for dessert,

31:47.151 --> 31:49.250
chocolate chip cookies

31:49.252 --> 31:51.621
and vanilla bean ice cream.

31:52.589 --> 31:54.691
[suspenseful music]

32:00.230 --> 32:01.398
Why?

32:05.402 --> 32:09.907
Because who doesn't like cookies
and ice cream.

32:10.842 --> 32:12.910
[clock ticking]

32:24.488 --> 32:26.554
[Mickey] Don't give
me that look.

32:26.556 --> 32:28.325
You clearly don't know
what you're dealing with.

32:29.127 --> 32:30.027
[sighs]

32:32.163 --> 32:33.730
You can't say no to Sinclairs.

32:41.772 --> 32:43.373
Why didn't you give him up?

32:44.708 --> 32:47.143
Her family,
they decide when to start a war.

32:47.145 --> 32:48.345
When to end a famine.

32:49.412 --> 32:50.614
When to kill the help.

32:51.715 --> 32:53.548
What was the price
for screwing over

32:53.550 --> 32:54.852
your old friend Freddie?

32:56.753 --> 32:59.287
They'll make me part
of the family.

32:59.289 --> 33:01.658
If June pulls this off,
she's gonna make me one of them.

33:02.626 --> 33:04.592
And if you play ball,

33:04.594 --> 33:06.628
then maybe she'll
give you a job. The kid, too.

33:06.630 --> 33:08.696
[scoffs]
You're out of your mind.

33:08.698 --> 33:10.132
[Mickey] Well,
you trained him well enough.

33:10.134 --> 33:11.200
He's a natural-born killer.

33:11.202 --> 33:13.434
No one's born to kill.

33:13.436 --> 33:14.736
And I didn't
make him do anything.

33:14.738 --> 33:16.939
Would you let him
live here rent-free

33:16.941 --> 33:18.373
if he wasn't you know,

33:18.375 --> 33:20.044
knocking off
all your bad customers?

33:23.948 --> 33:25.380
Ah!

33:25.382 --> 33:27.051
That's interesting.

33:29.352 --> 33:30.552
[Mickey] Are you scared of him,
Freddie?

33:30.554 --> 33:31.823
Syd's dangerous, Mick.

33:32.789 --> 33:34.457
He sees things, patterns.

33:36.459 --> 33:38.027
I met him at a homeless shelter.

33:38.029 --> 33:40.595
The guy was a hell of a cook
and he was a hell of a fighter.

33:40.597 --> 33:42.564
Did you even run
a background check on him?

33:42.566 --> 33:44.432
Of course, I ran
a background check.

33:44.434 --> 33:47.402
Age eight, his mom
and his sister split,

33:47.404 --> 33:48.570
and then he had
to get raised by his dad,

33:48.572 --> 33:50.172
and he was a real asshole, so...

33:50.174 --> 33:51.073
[Freddie] Yeah.

33:51.075 --> 33:53.275
His dad ends up dying
when Syd's eleven.

33:53.277 --> 33:54.812
He bounces from city to city.

33:56.180 --> 33:59.882
Syd's life makes Greek tragedies
look like fairy-tales.

33:59.884 --> 34:01.449
Yeah, and then he met you
four years ago

34:01.451 --> 34:02.584
and the two of you
have been knocking off

34:02.586 --> 34:05.154
all your bad customers
like there's no tomorrow.

34:05.156 --> 34:08.290
[suspenseful music]

34:08.292 --> 34:10.292
[Mickey] He also visits
that coffee girl every day

34:10.293 --> 34:11.994
<i>but he doesn't have the guts
to ask her out.</i>

34:11.996 --> 34:13.697
No, he doesn't like her
like that.

34:19.768 --> 34:22.137
You know, you and I made
a pretty good team

34:22.139 --> 34:23.139
back in the day.

34:24.608 --> 34:28.110
Now, maybe June pulls off
this little revolution,

34:28.112 --> 34:30.982
what do you say you and I
go on a celebratory bender?

34:35.152 --> 34:36.087
[knife rasps]

34:42.525 --> 34:44.628
[foreboding music]

34:47.931 --> 34:49.831
Oh...

34:49.833 --> 34:53.400
Getting soft on me, are you,
gunny professional babysitter?

34:53.402 --> 34:54.737
Don't start with me.

34:55.405 --> 34:57.172
[November] Hi.

34:57.174 --> 34:59.176
- What's your name, cutie?
- [shushing]

35:00.912 --> 35:02.579
[November] I've had many names.

35:04.181 --> 35:07.749
My name was Typhon and Moloch.

35:07.751 --> 35:10.451
My daddy made me change
my name so many times.

35:10.453 --> 35:11.586
[Aggie] We really have
to be going.

35:11.588 --> 35:12.487
[November clicking tongue]

35:12.489 --> 35:14.522
[man] The lady obviously doesn't
want you talking to her kid,

35:14.524 --> 35:15.723
so keep walking, psycho.

35:15.725 --> 35:17.458
[November] Look,
I was just having a little fun.

35:17.460 --> 35:19.194
- [man grunting]
- [Aggie screaming]

35:19.196 --> 35:20.697
- [men grunting]
- [thuds]

35:24.368 --> 35:26.469
[ominous music]

35:29.974 --> 35:31.474
[knocking]

35:32.910 --> 35:35.811
November, stay back
or I will shoot!

35:35.813 --> 35:37.012
[November] I'm here
for the steaks.

35:37.014 --> 35:39.982
Oh. Sure, why don't you come in
and make yourself at home?

35:39.984 --> 35:41.482
[November] I'll take that
as my invitation.

35:41.484 --> 35:43.285
Freddie!

35:43.287 --> 35:45.089
- [gunshot]
- [screaming]

35:46.756 --> 35:48.758
- [screaming continues]
- [knife clatters]

35:51.095 --> 35:52.593
[May] Hey, Luck.

35:52.595 --> 35:55.197
Come with aunt May.
Let's go play.

35:55.199 --> 35:56.631
[screaming]

35:56.633 --> 35:58.233
[shatters]

35:58.235 --> 35:59.234
Who the hell are you?

35:59.236 --> 36:01.138
I am The Chef.
Who the hell are you?

36:01.973 --> 36:03.638
Stranger!

36:03.640 --> 36:05.307
In the kitchen!

36:05.309 --> 36:07.042
[rustling]

36:07.044 --> 36:09.080
Oh, my god! Dad!

36:11.949 --> 36:13.781
[Chance] You... you look old.

36:13.783 --> 36:16.651
You never look old.
What's wrong?

36:16.653 --> 36:18.686
Grandpa August is the
worst to live with.

36:18.688 --> 36:19.756
Is Luck here?

36:23.094 --> 36:24.893
What the...

36:24.895 --> 36:26.163
What the hell are you wearing?

36:27.031 --> 36:28.696
[Chance] Hello.

36:28.698 --> 36:31.066
I made it
out of an old shirt I found.

36:31.068 --> 36:32.868
You look like a death
metal pin cushion.

36:32.870 --> 36:34.604
Nice to see you too, mom.

36:35.739 --> 36:37.973
[Chance] So,
when can I come home?

36:37.975 --> 36:39.975
August still thinks he can make
a proper lady out of me,

36:39.977 --> 36:41.076
but let me tell you something,

36:41.078 --> 36:42.811
that ship has crashed, sailed,
and now has a...

36:42.813 --> 36:47.282
Chance, put some clothes on,
and clean this up.

36:47.284 --> 36:49.418
[June] Cut her some slack.

36:49.420 --> 36:52.821
She's a young woman
living in my house rent-free.

36:52.823 --> 36:55.592
The least she can do
is not dress like a whore.

36:56.994 --> 36:57.895
Dad.

36:59.430 --> 37:01.263
August just called me a whore.

37:01.265 --> 37:03.432
I said you looked like a whore.

37:03.434 --> 37:05.467
Whether you're taken after
your mother or not

37:05.469 --> 37:07.336
remains to be seen.

37:07.338 --> 37:11.275
Now, put some clothes on
and prepare for dinner.

37:13.177 --> 37:14.078
Go!

37:16.447 --> 37:18.780
You know,
I like this chef, June.

37:18.782 --> 37:21.819
[August] Knows when to talk,
knows when to listen.

37:23.320 --> 37:25.220
My favorite kind of man is...

37:25.222 --> 37:27.789
Is a man of few words.

37:27.791 --> 37:29.458
When will the steaks arrive?

37:29.460 --> 37:31.793
Soon, chef, soon.

37:31.795 --> 37:34.631
Everything is going
perfectly according to plan.

37:37.168 --> 37:38.400
[Chance] Better?

37:38.402 --> 37:39.769
[August and June] Barely.

37:40.670 --> 37:41.904
I made it myself

37:41.906 --> 37:44.241
out of some of Grandma January's
old sewing stuff.

37:45.642 --> 37:47.409
I like designing.

37:47.411 --> 37:48.711
I think I want to do fashion.

37:49.612 --> 37:50.846
There's this program

37:50.848 --> 37:52.680
at a university
called the Sorbonne?

37:52.682 --> 37:55.286
No! Down! Put it down!

37:58.721 --> 38:00.721
Dude, relax.

38:00.723 --> 38:02.357
It's just, like, food.

38:02.359 --> 38:05.060
It's not just food,
it's part of the meal.

38:05.062 --> 38:05.963
Put it down.

38:06.964 --> 38:07.898
Down!

38:09.333 --> 38:10.600
Listen to The Chef.

38:15.506 --> 38:16.972
Whatever, psycho.

38:16.974 --> 38:19.110
- [June] Apologize. Now!
- [Chance] No!

38:23.914 --> 38:25.249
Sorry I called you psycho.

38:28.052 --> 38:29.585
No.

38:29.587 --> 38:32.056
You stupid, stupid girl.

38:34.058 --> 38:35.924
I haven't seen you in a year

38:35.926 --> 38:37.328
and you're treating me
like Luck.

38:41.132 --> 38:42.933
It was just a freaking sprout!

38:46.470 --> 38:48.372
[ominous music]

38:49.874 --> 38:52.474
Now, what would you like
your new <i>sous to do</i>

38:52.476 --> 38:54.011
to be of service, chef?

38:55.513 --> 38:57.379
She can get out of the kitchen.

38:57.381 --> 38:58.282
[August] Or?

39:03.154 --> 39:04.620
Dish duty.

39:04.622 --> 39:05.755
Good.

39:06.957 --> 39:08.859
Why don't we go
for a little tour?

39:13.864 --> 39:15.966
[ominous music]

39:21.939 --> 39:24.573
[August] I found this here today.

39:24.575 --> 39:25.775
<i>Would you like it?</i>

39:28.479 --> 39:30.713
<i>Tonight,
you dress like a Sinclair.</i>

39:34.251 --> 39:36.153
[ominous music]

39:49.934 --> 39:52.036
[ominous music continues]

40:06.550 --> 40:07.451
[Syd] Stop that.

40:08.519 --> 40:09.585
Dude.

40:09.587 --> 40:10.953
I'm sorry if you got offended.

40:10.955 --> 40:12.955
It's just life here is weird.

40:12.957 --> 40:14.456
August won't
let me have friends over

40:14.458 --> 40:16.124
and he won't
let me have the internet.

40:16.126 --> 40:18.193
I'm sorry,
but it was just a sprout.

40:18.195 --> 40:20.162
- [Syd] I need your help.
- [microwave beeping]

40:20.164 --> 40:21.029
Okay.

40:21.031 --> 40:22.531
I can do toast and burnt toast.

40:22.533 --> 40:24.866
The Sinclairs, vampires,
demons, or a werewolf cult?

40:24.868 --> 40:25.970
Which is it?

40:27.037 --> 40:29.871
Okay, a lot to unpack there.

40:29.873 --> 40:31.540
I have a skin condition.

40:31.542 --> 40:32.641
It's genetic.

40:32.643 --> 40:35.110
If I go out into the sun,
a rapid influx of vitamin D

40:35.112 --> 40:36.777
causes fast-reacting tumors
to grow.

40:36.779 --> 40:37.846
I don't want that.

40:37.848 --> 40:39.248
I wanna see the world and shit.

40:39.250 --> 40:43.185
That's why I have
to get daily blood transfusions.

40:43.187 --> 40:44.686
Okay,
so your parents lied to you.

40:44.688 --> 40:45.786
You're a vampire.

40:45.788 --> 40:47.389
No! We're just rich.

40:47.391 --> 40:49.460
Rich people are weird,
that is a fact.

40:50.394 --> 40:51.827
Vampire?

40:51.829 --> 40:52.930
I could have you fired.

40:55.232 --> 40:56.298
Drink this.

40:56.300 --> 40:57.199
[Chance] No.

40:57.201 --> 41:00.068
There's like 101 calories
in every cup of milk.

41:00.070 --> 41:02.104
You were just drinking
chocolate milk.

41:02.106 --> 41:03.474
Dude, that was chocolate milk.

41:04.575 --> 41:05.476
[woman screams]

41:06.477 --> 41:07.542
Drink it!

41:07.544 --> 41:09.246
Chocolate milk is different.

Oh, who's this?

41:25.763 --> 41:27.629
Oh, chef.

41:27.631 --> 41:29.333
Meet my youngest daughter.

41:30.801 --> 41:32.768
- Isn't she hot, huh?
- [laughing]

41:32.770 --> 41:34.569
Doesn't she wear that body well?

41:34.571 --> 41:35.837
- Woo!
- Whoa.

41:35.839 --> 41:36.972
[giggles]

41:36.974 --> 41:39.107
- Now have you a present for me?
- [moaning]

41:39.109 --> 41:41.743
Special delivery,
fresh off the bone.

41:41.745 --> 41:42.946
Smell that.

41:44.481 --> 41:45.514
- Mm.
- Mm.

41:45.516 --> 41:47.783
- Oh, my god.
- Isn't he handsome?

41:47.785 --> 41:50.419
He is so cute!

41:50.421 --> 41:51.753
Just look at this thing.

41:51.755 --> 41:53.388
Mm, mm, mm, can we keep him?

41:53.390 --> 41:55.190
I know what you want
for dessert.

41:55.192 --> 41:56.892
- [laughing]
- [chuckling]

41:56.894 --> 41:58.060
Chef.

41:58.062 --> 42:00.497
Why don't we take a look
at the meat, huh?

42:03.701 --> 42:05.602
[foreboding music]

42:16.947 --> 42:19.049
[foreboding music continues]

42:28.192 --> 42:30.894
[August] Have you ever seen
anything so exquisite?

42:32.496 --> 42:33.695
[stutters] Sir.

42:33.697 --> 42:35.597
Do me a favor.

42:35.599 --> 42:37.399
After you serve the entrées,

42:37.401 --> 42:39.802
why don't you two
take a chill pill,

42:39.804 --> 42:41.303
hang around here?

42:41.305 --> 42:44.539
We have some private family
affairs to discuss,

42:44.541 --> 42:46.007
understand?

42:46.009 --> 42:50.278
- Sir, the meat is...
- Is fresh.

42:50.280 --> 42:53.615
From quality livestock,
I can assure you.

42:53.617 --> 42:55.319
It's gonna be
one hell of a night.

42:57.654 --> 42:59.556

44:15.799 --> 44:17.034
Chance told me.

44:17.869 --> 44:19.102
[June] Ice cream milk.

44:21.138 --> 44:22.239
Thank you.

44:24.274 --> 44:25.908
How do you poison a man

44:25.910 --> 44:27.108
who knows
he's gonna be poisoned?

44:27.110 --> 44:28.645
He doesn't suspect a thing.

44:31.615 --> 44:32.716
What did he do to you?

44:34.853 --> 44:35.752
He has...

44:36.487 --> 44:37.954
beliefs.

44:37.956 --> 44:39.822
Archaic ones.

44:39.824 --> 44:43.494
He thinks family
is just another word for slave.

44:45.696 --> 44:48.131
You just focus on
what I brought you here to do.

44:50.902 --> 44:53.337
If you want to save Chance, run.

44:54.538 --> 44:55.639
You're an idiot.

44:56.707 --> 44:57.708
I don't run.

45:06.717 --> 45:08.483
Luck's fine.

45:08.485 --> 45:10.754
Mickey would die before anything
happened to them.

45:11.856 --> 45:13.190
His guard is down.

45:14.057 --> 45:15.123
We proceed.

45:15.125 --> 45:16.391
[thuds]

45:16.393 --> 45:17.794
And you call me an idiot.

45:19.263 --> 45:21.064
[Syd]
Life is a series of patterns.

45:22.432 --> 45:25.202
Water boils
at 100 degrees Celsius.

45:26.838 --> 45:28.572
Bread toasts at 176.

45:30.909 --> 45:32.442
I do not see the world,

45:33.845 --> 45:34.812
I watch it.

45:36.213 --> 45:38.081
Your father knows
I'm gonna poison him.

45:40.117 --> 45:43.518
I will not die tonight.

45:43.520 --> 45:44.788
[June] That's the spirit.

45:46.256 --> 45:48.358
Look, if I'm wrong,

45:49.693 --> 45:52.462
do whatever it takes
to get out of here.

45:54.464 --> 45:57.165
As dear demented father
always said,

45:57.167 --> 46:00.170
the ends will always
justify the means.

46:01.238 --> 46:02.304
Machiavelli said it.

46:02.306 --> 46:04.374
[scoffs] Father said it first.

46:09.479 --> 46:11.248
This plate to father, chef.

46:17.354 --> 46:18.589
[June] Beautiful.

46:19.824 --> 46:21.391
Absolutely beautiful.

46:23.093 --> 46:24.359
Anything you want to tell me?

46:24.361 --> 46:26.261
After dinner.

46:26.263 --> 46:27.596
Sydney's here to kill August.

46:27.598 --> 46:29.065
After dinner.

46:29.067 --> 46:30.833
[Chance] No, one question.

46:30.835 --> 46:32.870
It's silly, really, am I...

46:34.338 --> 46:35.905
- Are we...
- Going to be okay?

46:35.907 --> 46:37.105
Vampires?

46:37.107 --> 46:38.640
After dinner.

46:38.642 --> 46:40.477
I'll tell you everything,
I promise.

46:42.080 --> 46:43.278
[Chance sighs]

46:43.280 --> 46:44.581
I love you.

46:45.749 --> 46:46.650
Say it back.

46:49.119 --> 46:50.287
After dinner.

46:59.262 --> 47:01.365
[ominous music]

47:08.171 --> 47:09.506
A toast!

47:12.643 --> 47:14.542
As you all know,

47:14.544 --> 47:17.581
it will be June
and December's final harvest.

47:19.017 --> 47:20.183
Good family,

47:21.052 --> 47:22.252
good drink,

47:22.987 --> 47:25.087
and great food.

47:25.089 --> 47:27.257
To June and December.

What do you think you're doin'?

47:41.371 --> 47:42.472
Sitting down.

47:44.341 --> 47:45.843
That's November's chair.

47:48.378 --> 47:51.379
When you learn to act
like a Sinclair,

47:51.381 --> 47:52.884
you can dine like one.

47:54.986 --> 47:55.887
Chef!

48:07.297 --> 48:09.399
[foreboding music]

48:12.904 --> 48:14.504
Would you do us the honor

48:15.672 --> 48:17.809
of having the first taste?

48:22.245 --> 48:23.346
[Syd] Okay.

48:25.083 --> 48:26.918
Chef. Chef!

48:28.986 --> 48:30.287

Anything else?

49:07.724 --> 49:08.658
No.

We'll call you when we're ready
for the next course.

[Chance] <i>Grandpa August saysit's
an old Sinclair tradition,</i>

49:41.591 --> 49:42.992

tyrannical,</i>

49:42.994 --> 49:44.827
<i>cause even those who
marry into the family</i>

49:44.829 --> 49:45.796
<i>have to change
their names.</i>

51:12.716 --> 51:13.918
Who is missing from the table?

51:14.517 --> 51:15.885
Grandma January,

51:15.887 --> 51:17.654
but she's been gone
since I was a baby.

51:19.023 --> 51:20.455
And Uncle November.

51:20.457 --> 51:22.157
He's the family psycho.

51:22.159 --> 51:23.292
Don't use that word.

51:23.294 --> 51:24.659
It's true.

51:24.661 --> 51:26.028
Mom and Dad
are petrified of him.

51:26.030 --> 51:28.496
- You need to run.
- Run? Run where?

51:28.498 --> 51:30.232
We're a million miles
within anything.

51:30.234 --> 51:31.168
Pace yourself.

51:32.003 --> 51:33.403
I'm not running.

51:35.739 --> 51:37.607
- [door creaks]
- So hide.

51:38.742 --> 51:39.607
Closet?

51:39.609 --> 51:41.709
I'm more of a hiding in a...

51:41.711 --> 51:43.513

52:07.171 --> 52:08.505
would be a problem again?

52:09.874 --> 52:12.440
Is it true that grandfather has

52:12.442 --> 52:14.577
a special kind of torture
for them?

52:15.578 --> 52:18.613
I heard that he takes a Menorah,

52:18.615 --> 52:20.481
and he puts it up their arse,

52:20.483 --> 52:22.384
and he lights it from
the inside.

Please,

52:36.733 --> 52:39.502
I'm trying to keep room
for the main course.

52:41.872 --> 52:43.973
I need to save room for dessert.

52:43.975 --> 52:49.011
You know
how I hate to waste food.

54:11.462 --> 54:13.630
House Sinclair...

54:14.498 --> 54:15.598
is dying.

54:17.168 --> 54:19.734
We've been called angels,
demons.

54:19.736 --> 54:21.272
Chance thinks we're vampires.

54:24.175 --> 54:29.710
Our place in the natural order
of things is to cull the damned.

54:29.712 --> 54:33.614
Yet July preys on addicts.

54:33.616 --> 54:36.518
May on glutinous
New York socialites.

54:36.520 --> 54:38.821
April on the lost.

54:38.823 --> 54:42.157
I can bring us prosperity

54:42.159 --> 54:46.528
and happiness of the likes
we have never known.

54:46.530 --> 54:50.101
But not with that monster
at the head of House Sinclair.

54:51.734 --> 54:55.605
Who will have the courage
to stand with me?

55:06.417 --> 55:08.319

by their children

55:24.835 --> 55:26.769
or embarrassed by them.

55:27.704 --> 55:29.373
This is the thanks I get?

55:30.441 --> 55:32.673
I tutored your child.

55:32.675 --> 55:35.377
All I asked was your obedience.

55:35.379 --> 55:38.347
I even gave
your indignant husband a place

55:38.349 --> 55:39.283
in our family.

55:40.650 --> 55:42.384
We were never family.

55:42.386 --> 55:43.653
I have a family.

55:45.256 --> 55:46.190
Had.

who else was conspiring

55:55.933 --> 55:57.132
in your <i>coup d'gácher,</i>

55:57.134 --> 56:00.271
so I paid Cousin Mickey
a visit today.

56:01.405 --> 56:02.373
What have you done?

56:10.381 --> 56:11.748
Where's Luck?

56:12.516 --> 56:13.515
[May] Be proud.

56:13.517 --> 56:16.451
Little Lucky put up much more
of a fight than Mickey.

56:16.453 --> 56:18.455
Where is my child?

56:25.496 --> 56:27.529
Mmm.

56:27.531 --> 56:29.200
So good, mmm.

[December in Icelandic]
Bloody coward.

57:02.900 --> 57:05.601
[in English]
You said that to me once before.

57:05.603 --> 57:07.603
I took your tongue then.

57:07.605 --> 57:09.871
You know what
I'm going to take this time?

57:09.873 --> 57:11.942
[August in Icelandic]
To the devil.

57:13.043 --> 57:14.409
[in English] Say it!

Say it! Say it!

We dine on the traitors tonight!

[howling]

57:23.887 --> 57:25.921
You all knew
June was plotting something

57:25.923 --> 57:26.989
and you didn't tell me?

57:26.991 --> 57:29.625
We had it under control.

57:29.627 --> 57:31.059
That was cruel!

57:31.061 --> 57:33.428
You made her eat her child,
August.

57:33.430 --> 57:34.463
Really?

57:53.484 --> 57:55.552
Sydney didn't deserve
any of this.

57:57.087 --> 57:58.786
I do. I tried to kill them.

57:58.788 --> 58:01.089
Every family has its monsters.

58:01.091 --> 58:02.960
We're just extra.

58:04.561 --> 58:06.662
[February]
I'll have a piece of June.

58:06.664 --> 58:08.263
[May] I call dibs on the heart.

58:08.265 --> 58:11.500
[August] Well, boys,
now do we feel up for it, huh?

58:11.502 --> 58:13.735
[somber music]

58:13.737 --> 58:15.472
My story isn't your story.

58:17.141 --> 58:19.109
That's what family is, I think.

58:19.777 --> 58:22.044
One big story.

58:22.046 --> 58:24.281
[Luck] Each generation
is a new chapter.

58:25.349 --> 58:27.182
[screams]

58:27.184 --> 58:29.284
The day you were born,
dad went to August

58:29.286 --> 58:31.855
and asked to be free
of the Sinclair curse.

58:32.656 --> 58:34.056
He said no.

58:34.058 --> 58:35.957
Dad asked again.

58:35.959 --> 58:38.095
So August ripped the tongue
from his mouth.

58:40.130 --> 58:42.099
How come we couldn't see
what we were?

Look, I'm really flattered

59:37.654 --> 59:39.454
you want in your cult
or whatever this is,

59:39.456 --> 59:41.323
but I'm not really interested.
It's not my thing.

59:41.325 --> 59:43.191
[stuttering]
Everything will be fine.

59:43.193 --> 59:46.194
Fine? We're in the basement
of a family of vampires.

59:46.196 --> 59:48.296
Vampire is an
oversimplification.

59:48.298 --> 59:49.266
[pants]

59:50.869 --> 59:52.200
Why do they want me?

59:52.202 --> 59:55.303
They, they, they see me
get coffee from you every day.

59:55.305 --> 59:56.673
They think I like you.

59:57.941 --> 01:00:00.409
- Oh.
- I don't.

01:00:00.411 --> 01:00:03.178
Oh, well, you're super charming,
you know that?

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.613
You know, Adelaide doesn't
like you either,

01:00:04.615 --> 01:00:05.549
she thinks you're a creep.

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:07.949
Does she?

01:00:07.951 --> 01:00:11.153
Who comes to a coffee stand
every day for four years?

01:00:11.155 --> 01:00:12.489
Don't you have a life?

01:00:13.557 --> 01:00:14.525
She's open every day.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.960
She has nowhere else to go.

01:00:18.962 --> 01:00:20.697
All her family
is dead or something.

01:00:21.632 --> 01:00:22.865
[sighs]

01:00:22.867 --> 01:00:24.201
What's your excuse?

01:00:25.135 --> 01:00:26.336
Is Adelaide okay?

01:00:27.538 --> 01:00:28.603
I don't know.

01:00:28.605 --> 01:00:29.872
I think she got away.

01:00:29.874 --> 01:00:32.641
[Dakota] The psycho in
the white hoodie got me first.

was a little salty.

01:00:37.147 --> 01:00:38.315
[Dakota] Try and add ketchup?

01:00:40.317 --> 01:00:41.718
Why did you eat
from August's plate?

01:00:43.153 --> 01:00:45.289
If I did not,
he would not have trusted me.

01:00:47.558 --> 01:00:49.191
Arch hemlock,

01:00:49.193 --> 01:00:51.159
it kills your kind, right?

01:00:51.161 --> 01:00:53.328
Sunlight, silver,
and arch fucking hemlock,

01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:55.365
those are the three things
that can kill us.

01:00:55.999 --> 01:00:58.033
And you are?

01:00:58.035 --> 01:00:59.736
Servants of heaven
save the good.

Servants of hell
cull the damned.

As above so below ever after.

01:01:09.246 --> 01:01:11.079
Making a mother eat
her own child

01:01:11.081 --> 01:01:12.549
is culling the damned?

from the herd.

The traitors, June and December.

01:01:53.156 --> 01:01:57.392
They hired a killer,
an assassin,

01:01:57.394 --> 01:02:01.062
who was so obedient that he ate
from my poisoned plate.

Don't you dare laugh at him!

Bravery.

for pleasure.

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:30.227
I see in your eyes,
in your soul,

01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:34.064
you're a soldier looking
for an army.

01:02:34.832 --> 01:02:36.099
We could be your army.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:37.601

We strive
to make the world right.

to kill the kid?

is never good.

See, that's the beauty
about being a Sinclair.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.322
We decide who lives.

01:03:00.992 --> 01:03:03.059
Take me for what I have done,

01:03:03.061 --> 01:03:04.259
but let Dakota live.

What you take as weakness
I take as strength.

How far would you go
to be called "Sinclair"?

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:20.344
Does it come
with health insurance?

Good dental?

01:03:24.949 --> 01:03:27.684

is touching.

So we're going
to have a little game

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:37.327

It's not really my thing.

01:07:14.344 --> 01:07:15.476
No.

01:07:15.478 --> 01:07:16.979
[light clicks]

01:07:16.981 --> 01:07:17.915
Okay.

01:07:19.482 --> 01:07:21.551
That was something.

01:07:22.719 --> 01:07:25.120
Okay, Chance you can,
you can do this.

01:07:25.122 --> 01:07:27.024
[suspenseful music]

01:07:28.059 --> 01:07:29.793
[May] Hello? Come out!

01:07:30.493 --> 01:07:32.762
Come on, let's play!

01:07:40.004 --> 01:07:42.403
[suspenseful music]

01:07:42.405 --> 01:07:44.572
[rustling]

01:07:44.574 --> 01:07:46.708
Oh, little bird.

01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:50.447
August has been waiting
years to taste you.

01:07:54.252 --> 01:07:55.152
Hm.

01:07:56.753 --> 01:07:58.455
- [grunts]
- [May shrieks]

01:08:02.093 --> 01:08:03.691
[spits]

01:08:03.693 --> 01:08:05.995
Let's see if your taste
is as good as your mom.

01:08:05.997 --> 01:08:07.430
[growls]

01:08:09.033 --> 01:08:10.366

01:08:10.368 --> 01:08:12.569
[pants]

01:08:14.939 --> 01:08:17.841
[May] Bitch, I would
start running if I was you.

01:08:20.077 --> 01:08:21.845
[Chance panting]

01:08:24.881 --> 01:08:26.483
[door rattling]

01:08:27.484 --> 01:08:29.020
[rattling continues]

01:08:30.254 --> 01:08:32.488
[panting]

01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:35.057
[hissing]

01:08:35.059 --> 01:08:36.491
[sniffs]

01:08:36.493 --> 01:08:38.160
I can smell you.

01:08:38.162 --> 01:08:40.563
[May growling, hissing]

01:08:47.537 --> 01:08:49.673
[hissing]

01:08:53.944 --> 01:08:55.176
[thuds]

01:08:55.179 --> 01:08:57.479
[sniffs and hisses]

01:09:06.256 --> 01:09:09.193
[growling]

01:09:12.595 --> 01:09:14.231
[May snarls]

01:09:17.301 --> 01:09:18.667
[lights clicking]

01:09:21.604 --> 01:09:23.537
[May snarls, sniffs]

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:24.975
[growls, hisses]

01:09:27.278 --> 01:09:28.377
[floor creaks]

01:09:28.379 --> 01:09:29.676
- [hisses]
- [Chance screaming]

01:09:29.679 --> 01:09:33.215
No! No! No!

01:09:33.216 --> 01:09:36.118
Stop! Please! Please!

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.386
Stop! No, no!

01:09:38.389 --> 01:09:40.055
No, please!

01:09:40.057 --> 01:09:41.689
No! Stop!

01:09:41.691 --> 01:09:43.560
[Chance sobbing]

01:09:45.395 --> 01:09:47.529
[panting]

01:09:54.704 --> 01:09:56.073
Oh, you poor thing.

01:09:57.774 --> 01:09:59.176
Ease off the wine,

01:10:00.277 --> 01:10:01.711
they'll grow back in an hour.

01:10:04.714 --> 01:10:05.816
[Chance] August.

01:10:07.985 --> 01:10:08.953
Grandpa.

01:10:13.623 --> 01:10:14.825
Where is mom?

01:10:17.128 --> 01:10:19.163
You wanted to know
what you were.

01:10:20.865 --> 01:10:22.199
Well, this is it.

01:10:24.935 --> 01:10:25.868
Dad!

01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:28.303
[November] Oh well,
they were delicious.

01:10:28.305 --> 01:10:31.739
I do think The Chef should get
some kind of an award though

01:10:31.741 --> 01:10:34.376
for how he prepared
little baby Luck.

01:10:34.378 --> 01:10:35.676
Simply divine.

01:10:35.678 --> 01:10:37.214
[Chance] You monsters!

01:10:37.982 --> 01:10:39.647
[sobbing]

01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:42.820
I will never be like you.

01:10:43.553 --> 01:10:45.154
Fine.

01:10:45.156 --> 01:10:46.090
New deal.

01:10:48.059 --> 01:10:51.896
Kill her and you can
have your freedom.

01:10:54.498 --> 01:10:55.732
What?

01:10:57.634 --> 01:10:58.836
No!

01:11:02.406 --> 01:11:03.640
Like...

01:11:05.109 --> 01:11:07.278
free, free?

01:11:08.279 --> 01:11:10.745
[August] Like free, free.

01:11:10.747 --> 01:11:12.083
Like a little bird.

01:11:13.551 --> 01:11:14.651
[sighs]

01:11:18.055 --> 01:11:19.056
Okay.

01:11:20.224 --> 01:11:21.325
Excuse me?

01:11:22.659 --> 01:11:23.828
[yells]

01:11:25.062 --> 01:11:26.495
[grunts]

01:11:26.497 --> 01:11:28.332
[Chance panting]

01:11:32.635 --> 01:11:33.804
[grunts]

01:11:34.438 --> 01:11:35.603
[Dakota groans]

01:11:35.605 --> 01:11:37.306
[panting]

01:11:37.308 --> 01:11:39.844
[both grunting]

01:11:45.782 --> 01:11:47.985
[grunting continues]

01:11:49.086 --> 01:11:50.254
[squelches]

01:11:51.388 --> 01:11:53.824
[Chance gasping]

01:12:01.232 --> 01:12:03.300
[thudding]

01:12:12.642 --> 01:12:14.945
[somber music]

01:12:16.713 --> 01:12:17.982
[grunts]

01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:29.026
[suspenseful music]

01:12:35.966 --> 01:12:38.068
[thunder rumbling]

01:12:44.175 --> 01:12:46.074
I wanted it to be epic
and I scared you.

01:12:46.076 --> 01:12:47.278
Oh, I knew I'd screw this up.

01:12:48.179 --> 01:12:49.945
Hello, hi!

01:12:49.947 --> 01:12:52.514
Um, would you like a sword?

01:12:52.516 --> 01:12:54.383
[Luck] Would a sword
make you feel safer?

01:12:54.385 --> 01:12:55.450
What?

01:12:55.452 --> 01:12:56.618
Yes.

01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:58.020
Well, why didn't you say so?

01:12:58.022 --> 01:12:58.989
- [whirs]
- Ah!

01:13:04.528 --> 01:13:06.428
Three, two, one.

01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:07.529
[whirs, rumbles]

01:13:07.531 --> 01:13:08.698
[footsteps rustling]

01:13:14.572 --> 01:13:16.872
This doesn't make any sense!

01:13:16.874 --> 01:13:18.273
I know this is all very strange,

01:13:18.275 --> 01:13:20.377
but you've really got no choice
but to trust me.

01:13:21.612 --> 01:13:22.846
Now, give me a hug.

01:13:24.982 --> 01:13:27.017
- Am I really...
- Yeah.

01:13:31.021 --> 01:13:32.787
You know, I always thought
God would be more

01:13:32.789 --> 01:13:34.789
"Hi, I'm Morgan Freeman."

01:13:34.791 --> 01:13:36.959
[chuckles] I'm no God.

01:13:36.961 --> 01:13:38.795
Use your head, stupid.

01:13:39.663 --> 01:13:41.263
Luck?

01:13:41.265 --> 01:13:44.233
The one and only and
as adorable as ever.

01:13:44.235 --> 01:13:45.169
[chuckles]

01:13:46.403 --> 01:13:47.304
But...

01:13:48.339 --> 01:13:49.404
you were...

01:13:49.406 --> 01:13:50.771
And now, I'm ta-da!

01:13:50.773 --> 01:13:52.941
Time doesn't work the same way
here the way it does there.

01:13:52.943 --> 01:13:54.009
It's more...

01:13:54.011 --> 01:13:56.511
Mom and Dad? Are they here?

01:13:56.513 --> 01:13:57.579
Mom and Dad are together.

01:13:57.581 --> 01:13:59.248
Happy. And The Chef?

01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:01.250
Well, if all goes to plan,
the chef dies.

01:14:01.252 --> 01:14:02.351
Right now, he's counting down

01:14:02.353 --> 01:14:03.452
until the arch hemlock
takes effect,

01:14:03.454 --> 01:14:05.854
but he's off by two seconds
and I'm rambling.

01:14:05.856 --> 01:14:07.689
No.

01:14:07.691 --> 01:14:09.191
No, this isn't happening.

01:14:09.193 --> 01:14:11.994
It's been happening
since August...

01:14:11.996 --> 01:14:14.129
Actually he's gone
by many names.

01:14:14.131 --> 01:14:16.965
Samael, Kölski,
Al-Shaitan, Dracula,

01:14:16.967 --> 01:14:18.333
- The Infernal Revelation...
- [thunder rumbling]

01:14:18.335 --> 01:14:20.068
since he stole
the King of Horn's heart,

01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:21.536
like ripped it from his chest.

01:14:21.538 --> 01:14:23.905
- And then the King of Halos...
- The King of what?

01:14:23.907 --> 01:14:25.607
Halos? Like...

01:14:25.609 --> 01:14:26.575
[imitates angel singing]

01:14:26.577 --> 01:14:28.110
He stole the heart
of the King of Horns.

01:14:28.112 --> 01:14:29.745
It was a huge deal, epic.

01:14:29.747 --> 01:14:31.546
Sun dragons
and hellfire cannons...

01:14:31.548 --> 01:14:34.184
Are we evil King Demon vampires?

01:14:35.419 --> 01:14:37.219
Evil? Uh...

01:14:37.221 --> 01:14:40.689
Is a knife a weapon or a tool?
[chuckles]

01:14:40.691 --> 01:14:44.359
If we are V-words, it's up to us
what we do with it.

01:14:44.361 --> 01:14:47.462
Sure, the Sinclairs need
daily human blood to survive,

01:14:47.464 --> 01:14:49.531
and if we stay the sun too long
we turn into fireballs, and...

01:14:49.533 --> 01:14:51.502
We're seriously vampires.

01:14:52.536 --> 01:14:53.871
I know this is a lot.

01:14:54.872 --> 01:14:57.105
I was just as scared as you are

01:14:57.107 --> 01:14:59.576
when I found out our family's
little secret.

01:15:03.414 --> 01:15:04.581
It really is you.

01:15:06.450 --> 01:15:10.652
I've waited so,
so long to see you.

01:15:10.654 --> 01:15:12.421
[Luck] Please,
I have to tell you something

01:15:12.423 --> 01:15:14.425
otherwise, this will all be
for nothing.

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:18.495
We don't have long before
August finds us here.

01:15:20.931 --> 01:15:23.133
[February clapping]

01:15:24.001 --> 01:15:25.502
[Dakota panting]

01:15:26.337 --> 01:15:28.238
[clapping]

01:15:30.941 --> 01:15:32.943
[Dakota panting]

01:15:34.545 --> 01:15:35.579
Disappointing.

01:15:37.681 --> 01:15:38.882
November,

01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:41.452
bring in the third trial.

01:15:44.788 --> 01:15:46.890
[foreboding music]

01:15:50.794 --> 01:15:52.928
[Adelaide grunting]

01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:54.064
[Syd groans]

01:15:55.632 --> 01:15:57.368
[panting]

01:15:58.869 --> 01:16:00.070
[gasps]

01:16:00.771 --> 01:16:01.972
Dakota?

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.440
[Adelaide] I don't know
what happened.

01:16:05.442 --> 01:16:06.477
They grabbed me.

01:16:07.611 --> 01:16:08.979
This is sick.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.814
You bastard, I'll kill you!

01:16:11.816 --> 01:16:13.417
- I'll crush your head!
- Hey!

01:16:14.351 --> 01:16:15.252
[Dakota grunts]

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.487
[sobbing]

01:16:18.489 --> 01:16:19.721
[panting]

01:16:19.723 --> 01:16:20.624
You!

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:23.260
[Syd pants, groans]

01:16:26.363 --> 01:16:28.096
[February] I haven't had
this much fun

01:16:28.098 --> 01:16:30.300
since Titus and the lions.

01:16:31.001 --> 01:16:32.401
Take the blade.

01:16:32.403 --> 01:16:33.702
[August] Do it!

01:16:33.704 --> 01:16:34.871
Go on!

01:16:34.873 --> 01:16:36.407
[screaming]

01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:40.110
[disembodied voices murmuring]

01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:45.182
[murmuring continue]

01:16:51.755 --> 01:16:53.657
[ominous music]

01:16:59.229 --> 01:17:00.964
- [gasps]
- [August] So...

01:17:02.266 --> 01:17:04.468
are you ready to join
the family?

01:17:08.105 --> 01:17:09.206
Is that a yes?

01:17:12.576 --> 01:17:14.543
See?

01:17:14.545 --> 01:17:16.913
- I knew you'd come around.
- [panting]

01:17:16.915 --> 01:17:21.783
Unfortunately, there is no room
in the family for you.

01:17:21.785 --> 01:17:25.589
So what I'm going to do
is devour them all.

01:17:27.191 --> 01:17:29.859
But we're going to show you
a little mercy.

01:17:29.861 --> 01:17:31.128
[August] Sinclairs,

01:17:32.262 --> 01:17:36.166
how about
we give this brave warrior

01:17:37.768 --> 01:17:39.668
a hero's execution?

01:17:39.670 --> 01:17:40.604
[February] Ah, yes.

01:17:41.638 --> 01:17:42.639
[August] Good boy.

01:17:43.942 --> 01:17:46.043
[foreboding music]

01:17:48.479 --> 01:17:50.212
I used to think
being born a Sinclair

01:17:50.214 --> 01:17:51.715
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:17:54.485 --> 01:17:56.286
[grunts, sobs]

01:17:57.621 --> 01:17:58.520
[Syd coughing]

01:17:58.522 --> 01:18:00.857
[July] Your eyes look
even more beautiful than before.

01:18:00.859 --> 01:18:02.557
[laughing]

01:18:02.559 --> 01:18:04.927
I think I convinced
myself that I...

01:18:04.929 --> 01:18:06.330
I could actually be happy.

01:18:08.632 --> 01:18:11.199
Tonight has been 5,000 years
in the making.

01:18:11.201 --> 01:18:13.735
[thunder rumbles]

01:18:13.737 --> 01:18:16.438
[Luck] Five thousand years
for one meal.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.773
One attempt to take the life
of August Sinclair.

01:18:18.775 --> 01:18:21.278
[August] You were a worthy
adversary, son.

01:18:24.715 --> 01:18:26.216
Look at you now.

01:18:28.953 --> 01:18:32.454
Fourteen, thirteen, twelve...

01:18:32.456 --> 01:18:35.190
- Why the fuck is he counting?
- Eleven...

01:18:35.192 --> 01:18:36.993
Put his head on the stone.

01:18:36.995 --> 01:18:38.660
Ten...

01:18:38.662 --> 01:18:39.996
nine...

01:18:39.998 --> 01:18:41.298
[August] Put his head
on the rock.

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:45.200
Eight... [grunts]

01:18:45.202 --> 01:18:48.069
[Syd] Seven, six...

01:18:48.071 --> 01:18:51.039
five. four...

01:18:51.041 --> 01:18:52.541
- [Syd] Three!
- [coughing]

01:18:52.543 --> 01:18:55.176
- [Syd] Two!
- What's he doing?

01:18:55.178 --> 01:18:57.447
Enough! Give me the sword!

01:18:58.682 --> 01:18:59.882
[screams]

01:18:59.884 --> 01:19:01.685
[grunting]

01:19:02.854 --> 01:19:04.321
Kill him, he did this. [coughs]

01:19:05.188 --> 01:19:07.122
[Sydney] One.

01:19:07.124 --> 01:19:08.759
- [August screaming]
- [coughing]

01:19:10.594 --> 01:19:12.362
[screaming]

01:19:14.164 --> 01:19:16.133
[thunder rumbling]

01:19:17.167 --> 01:19:19.136
[growls]

01:19:21.638 --> 01:19:23.273
[groans]

01:19:27.845 --> 01:19:30.280
[ominous music]

01:19:39.323 --> 01:19:41.690
[ominous music continues]

01:19:41.692 --> 01:19:43.493
We were made
to kill the monsters,

01:19:45.562 --> 01:19:46.663
not become them.

01:19:48.198 --> 01:19:50.133
[April] You've lost your way,
Papa.

01:19:53.604 --> 01:19:54.738
[squelches]

01:19:59.911 --> 01:20:01.813
[ominous music]

01:20:12.522 --> 01:20:14.625
[ominous music continues]

01:20:17.394 --> 01:20:18.562
[Syd grunts]

01:20:20.764 --> 01:20:21.665
How?

01:20:34.344 --> 01:20:36.713
[thunder rumbling]

01:20:47.624 --> 01:20:48.525
[sniffs]

01:20:58.602 --> 01:21:00.537
My entire family is dead.

01:21:02.974 --> 01:21:06.374
[April] I ate one of my nieces.

01:21:06.376 --> 01:21:09.312
I watched the other have her
throat crushed.

01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:12.516
Why am I still alive?

01:21:13.885 --> 01:21:14.785
Huh?

01:21:16.054 --> 01:21:17.587
Because you didn't eat June.

01:21:19.690 --> 01:21:20.655
[laughs]

01:21:20.657 --> 01:21:22.490
Of course, I didn't eat her!

01:21:22.492 --> 01:21:23.895
She was my sister.

01:21:24.829 --> 01:21:25.863
[chuckling]

01:21:29.834 --> 01:21:31.702
[April] How'd you know August
would eat her?

01:21:33.637 --> 01:21:35.572
He liked to devour his enemies.

01:21:37.008 --> 01:21:39.374
Any chef would have known
that the steaks May brought

01:21:39.376 --> 01:21:40.711
were not from a cow.

01:21:42.512 --> 01:21:44.414
So you didn't poison August.

01:21:47.417 --> 01:21:49.651
You poisoned June and December

01:21:49.653 --> 01:21:51.087
- hoping...
- Knowing.

01:21:51.089 --> 01:21:52.456
That he'd eat her.

01:21:54.859 --> 01:21:55.860
[scoffs]

01:21:59.529 --> 01:22:02.363
If June's plan
would have worked,

01:22:02.365 --> 01:22:03.633
would you have followed her?

01:22:06.236 --> 01:22:08.238
June was my father's daughter.

01:22:09.372 --> 01:22:12.375
Eventually, power corrupts.

01:22:15.579 --> 01:22:16.480
[thuds]

01:22:22.086 --> 01:22:23.988
[somber music]

01:22:34.564 --> 01:22:36.834
[somber music continues]

01:22:47.011 --> 01:22:50.014
They got some really shiny
things in here.

01:22:50.982 --> 01:22:52.781
It's not right to steal.

01:22:52.783 --> 01:22:55.619
[scoffs] Says the serial killer.

01:22:57.855 --> 01:23:01.389
Normally, yes,
but they're not people.

01:23:01.391 --> 01:23:03.391
How's that for a loophole?

01:23:03.393 --> 01:23:04.761
I should be a lawyer.

01:23:08.498 --> 01:23:10.600
[somber music]

01:23:20.077 --> 01:23:21.979
[somber music continues]

01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:31.856
[Dakota clears throat]

01:23:38.029 --> 01:23:40.363
[somber music]

01:23:47.939 --> 01:23:50.373
[somber music continues]

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.416
[footsteps rustling]

01:24:05.056 --> 01:24:07.124
[somber music]

01:24:16.801 --> 01:24:18.135
[Adelaide]
Mr. Two Black Coffees.

01:24:19.769 --> 01:24:20.670
Hi.

01:24:24.075 --> 01:24:26.610
I thought my family
was a disaster, but...

01:24:29.213 --> 01:24:30.447
but them.

01:24:33.251 --> 01:24:34.551
Gosh, what a night.

01:24:35.552 --> 01:24:36.888
Christ Almighty.

01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.957
Nope.

01:24:42.159 --> 01:24:43.094
Sydney.

01:24:44.061 --> 01:24:45.062
Chef.

01:24:49.633 --> 01:24:51.068
[chuckling]

01:24:55.006 --> 01:24:56.073
Your name is Sydney?

01:24:59.143 --> 01:25:00.510
That is so weird.

01:25:02.445 --> 01:25:03.948
I had a brother called Sydney.

01:25:11.222 --> 01:25:12.857
Do you know what
happened to him?

01:25:18.495 --> 01:25:20.597
[somber music]

01:25:21.798 --> 01:25:23.566
[Adelaide] Mom said
there was a fire.

01:25:28.538 --> 01:25:29.974
No one was in the house.

01:25:48.092 --> 01:25:50.527
[somber music]

01:26:00.104 --> 01:26:01.105
[Adelaide sniffles]

01:26:10.747 --> 01:26:12.850
[light music]

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:16.885
[Luck] <i>Every army sent</i>

01:26:16.887 --> 01:26:19.656
<i>to recover the King of Horn's
heart was cut down.</i>

01:26:20.958 --> 01:26:22.492
<i>So The Chef was forged.</i>

01:26:24.862 --> 01:26:26.931
<i>Someone August
would underestimate.</i>

01:26:29.367 --> 01:26:32.101
<i>If Sydney failed, they would
have kept trying.</i>

01:26:32.103 --> 01:26:34.602
<i>Over and over.</i>

01:26:34.604 --> 01:26:36.974
<i>His actions
saved everyone.</i>

01:26:39.509 --> 01:26:40.677
And now?

01:26:42.612 --> 01:26:43.814
[Luck] <i>Sydney is free.</i>

01:26:45.850 --> 01:26:47.182
When I learned of their plan,

01:26:47.184 --> 01:26:49.286
I made a deal
with The Above and The Below.

01:26:51.055 --> 01:26:53.989
Sydney had been robbed of
the first 24 years of his life,

01:26:53.991 --> 01:26:56.291
so I demanded
they give those years

01:26:56.293 --> 01:26:57.359
to someone else.

01:26:57.361 --> 01:26:58.262
Good.

01:26:59.363 --> 01:27:00.530
No, I...

01:27:01.631 --> 01:27:03.932
I've seen too much to go back.

01:27:03.934 --> 01:27:04.835
No.

01:27:06.237 --> 01:27:07.138
No.

01:27:08.239 --> 01:27:09.639
I don't deserve it.

01:27:12.642 --> 01:27:14.011
You're absolutely right.

01:27:15.446 --> 01:27:16.947
I'm scared.

01:27:18.215 --> 01:27:19.582
I know.

01:27:20.683 --> 01:27:22.784
I love you.

01:27:22.786 --> 01:27:25.322
I love you and I know
you'll be alright.

01:27:29.527 --> 01:27:31.962
[somber music]

01:27:48.846 --> 01:27:51.648
[somber music continues]

01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:59.356
[gasps]

01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:01.992
[inhales deeply]

01:28:08.399 --> 01:28:09.366
[groans]

01:28:14.004 --> 01:28:15.705
[pants]

01:28:17.241 --> 01:28:19.143
