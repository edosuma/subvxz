00:00.023 --> 00:02.023
Previously on "Shades of Blue"...

00:02.055 --> 00:04.054
It's one thing running drugs;
it's a whole other thing

00:04.070 --> 00:06.070
when you make a little kid do it!

00:06.078 --> 00:07.804
Quince is a street thug
trying to get out of prison.

00:07.829 --> 00:10.765
I'll never trust you again.
I'll do anything for Julia.

00:10.799 --> 00:12.767
I will not let her go down.

00:12.801 --> 00:14.335
When my daughter died,

00:14.369 --> 00:17.838
Nate took a bat to the dealer
who sold her the drugs

00:17.873 --> 00:19.774
and left him lying in the street.

00:19.808 --> 00:20.641
Julia covered it up.

00:20.676 --> 00:23.811
- The Feds are chasing Bianchi. - Feds?

00:23.845 --> 00:26.581
I want to make sure that they
don't get you instead.

00:28.116 --> 00:29.283
Julia. You hit?

00:30.819 --> 00:31.586
Woz, get down!

00:31.620 --> 00:33.788
You got to get him to the hospital!

00:35.157 --> 00:36.524
You're gonna hunt these shooters down.

00:36.558 --> 00:37.425
Where's Bianchi?

00:37.459 --> 00:38.626
All right, I'll tell you!

00:38.660 --> 00:41.696
Bianchi's got dirt on everybody
who's anybody in New York.

00:41.730 --> 00:43.598
- Where does he keep this dirt?
- Lawyer's office.

00:43.632 --> 00:45.266
<i>There's a box locked up there.</i>

00:45.300 --> 00:47.335
<i>Get the box, and we'll get him.</i>

00:47.369 --> 00:49.704
- What's the charge this time?
- Double homicide.

00:49.738 --> 00:51.372
Are you trying to make a career

00:51.406 --> 00:53.841
of losing prosecutions
based on planted evidence?

00:53.875 --> 00:55.042
Why make it quick,

00:55.077 --> 00:56.811
when he can face a lifetime
locked up as a cop shooter?

00:56.845 --> 00:58.112
Closure.

01:04.519 --> 01:06.621
What made you decide to come in today?

01:08.590 --> 01:10.658
Uh... uh...

01:10.692 --> 01:12.827
It wasn't a decision.

01:12.861 --> 01:14.228
Is this a mandatory visit?

01:14.263 --> 01:16.497
Something that happened at work?

01:16.531 --> 01:18.447
Yeah, something like that.

01:20.235 --> 01:22.803
I... I killed a few people

01:22.838 --> 01:24.472
recently.

01:24.506 --> 01:25.806
Would you like to talk about that?

01:25.841 --> 01:27.808
I get a lot of cops that come in here

01:27.843 --> 01:30.479
after traumatic experiences.

01:31.513 --> 01:34.148
Let's consider this a preemptive strike.

01:34.182 --> 01:36.484
There's something on the horizon?

01:36.518 --> 01:37.485
Justice.

01:38.854 --> 01:42.556
I mean, it comes for us all in the end.

01:42.591 --> 01:46.193
The tricky part is keeping it contained

01:46.228 --> 01:48.712
to the people that deserve it.

01:49.898 --> 01:50.931
Not guilty.

01:50.966 --> 01:53.501
And on the second count,
murder in the first degree

01:53.535 --> 01:56.837
of Miss Elena Costa, how do you plead?

01:56.872 --> 01:58.239
Not guilty.

01:58.273 --> 01:59.707
Mister Gomez?

01:59.741 --> 02:02.543
Given the brutal nature
of this double homicide

02:02.577 --> 02:04.845
and that Mr. Bianchi
as recently as two days ago

02:04.880 --> 02:06.580
deceived customs officials
into believing

02:06.615 --> 02:09.183
he left the country,
the people request that

02:09.217 --> 02:11.419
the defendant remain detained
without bail.

02:11.453 --> 02:12.520
Mr. Kirschner?

02:12.554 --> 02:15.856
Your Honor, the guilt
or innocence of my client...

02:15.891 --> 02:17.858
I thought Judge Gibson drew the case?

02:17.893 --> 02:20.861
Gibson had some sort of
bizarre fender bender at lunch.

02:20.896 --> 02:22.930
They replaced him with Lowry.

02:22.964 --> 02:24.965
For the arraignment?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.534
The entire case now.

02:26.568 --> 02:27.802
So based on the various attempts

02:27.836 --> 02:29.904
at false convictions,

02:29.938 --> 02:33.941
and the NYPD's continuous
harassment of my client,

02:33.975 --> 02:35.943
I ask the court
to please release Mr. Bianchi

02:35.977 --> 02:38.479
on his own recognizance until trial.

02:38.513 --> 02:40.915
Your Honor,
the NYPD has been a target...

02:40.949 --> 02:42.416
Sit down, Mr. Gomez.

02:42.451 --> 02:44.819
Save your opening statement
for another day.

02:44.853 --> 02:46.554
Bail's set at $2 million,

02:46.588 --> 02:49.590
pending the surrender
of Mr. Bianchi's passport.

02:49.624 --> 02:51.225
Thank you very much, Your Honor.

02:54.262 --> 02:55.663
I would have led with flight risk.

02:55.697 --> 02:56.897
That's all the court cares about.

02:56.932 --> 02:58.899
So the DA assigned the second best

02:58.934 --> 03:00.034
prosecutor in the office.

03:00.068 --> 03:02.503
The strategy was to hold
Bianchi on the double homicide

03:02.537 --> 03:05.239
while we linked him to the
attempted hit on your crew.

03:05.273 --> 03:06.741
And Caroline?

03:06.775 --> 03:08.809
Even if we could prove
Bianchi ordered her murder,

03:08.844 --> 03:11.445
my boss feels it's a separate incident.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.581
So does that mean he's
letting you consult on this?

03:13.615 --> 03:14.982
There's still the issue
of the girlfriend.

03:15.016 --> 03:16.283
What girlfriend?

03:16.318 --> 03:17.184
My conflict of interest.

03:17.219 --> 03:19.816
She's one of the cops
Bianchi went after.

03:20.956 --> 03:23.491
I told my boss about us.

03:23.525 --> 03:25.292
High profile nature of this case,

03:25.327 --> 03:26.927
he needed to know.

03:26.962 --> 03:28.562
Officially.

Let me take you to lunch.

03:39.374 --> 03:40.674
You hungry?

03:40.709 --> 03:42.296
I could eat.

03:43.311 --> 03:44.278
Oops.

03:44.312 --> 03:45.513
What?

03:45.547 --> 03:46.714
It's a good thing that we're official.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.349
I think I just branded you.

03:48.383 --> 03:49.617
I'll meet you out front.

03:51.653 --> 03:52.853
Bathroom open?

03:52.888 --> 03:54.622
Yeah, all done.

04:02.697 --> 04:04.865
<i>Harlee. How'd it go?</i>

04:04.900 --> 04:06.300
Bianchi made bail.

04:06.334 --> 04:07.735
<i>Yeah, but I don't like the idea</i>

04:07.769 --> 04:09.370
of him being out and about.

04:09.404 --> 04:11.505
I mean, things could go south fast.

04:11.540 --> 04:13.641
He already shot Nate
and kidnapped Christina.

04:13.675 --> 04:15.409
I don't know how much
further south it could go.

04:15.444 --> 04:17.043
Anything in Bianchi's box of secrets

04:17.077 --> 04:18.646
on a Judge Lowry?

04:18.680 --> 04:19.880
Not that I remember.

04:19.915 --> 04:21.582
It's... it's back at the house.

04:21.616 --> 04:22.716
Did Bianchi have anything on us?

04:22.751 --> 04:25.419
<i>Not yet, but there are four thumb drives</i>

04:25.454 --> 04:26.454
<i>that I can't open.</i>

04:26.488 --> 04:28.923
<i>It's... it's some kind of encryption.</i>

04:28.957 --> 04:32.026
I figure Bianchi's
biggest fireworks are on that.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.861
Harlee?

04:33.895 --> 04:35.396
<i>Harlee?</i>

04:42.871 --> 04:46.006
A hazard of illicit affection.

04:47.467 --> 04:49.646
Take it you brought your passport.

04:50.078 --> 04:52.621
You've taken quite an interest in me,

04:52.655 --> 04:53.870
Counselor.

04:53.905 --> 04:55.916
Homicide tends to get my attention.

04:55.951 --> 04:56.951
Tell me,

04:56.985 --> 04:58.786
which is worse?

04:58.820 --> 05:01.622
The corrupt cop who feigns innocence

05:01.656 --> 05:04.391
or the self-righteous fool
who falls for it?

05:04.426 --> 05:05.392
Don't.

05:05.427 --> 05:07.461
Don't talk to me about innocence.

05:07.496 --> 05:09.864
Why would I slip a bloody Sap

05:09.898 --> 05:13.534
into the pocket of
a Brunello Cucinelli suit

05:13.568 --> 05:16.036
and then sit down at dinner,
especially when

05:16.071 --> 05:18.973
I have guys to handle such
things not three tables away?

05:19.007 --> 05:20.074
Oh, I got a theory.

05:20.108 --> 05:21.976
Oh, so do I.

05:22.010 --> 05:24.378
You've been bewitched, my friend.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.616
Since I didn't get to try your case,

05:28.650 --> 05:30.084
let's get this on record now.

05:30.118 --> 05:32.720
You're a murderer, and you're a coward.

05:32.754 --> 05:33.921
But I'm not blind.

05:33.955 --> 05:34.989
You got pinched.

05:35.023 --> 05:36.957
Do the time like a man.

05:36.992 --> 05:38.893
Don't go after the family
of civil servants.

05:38.927 --> 05:41.962
Family, is that what
you're calling her now?

05:41.997 --> 05:43.964
The poor girl you left at the altar

05:43.999 --> 05:45.499
just so you could

05:45.534 --> 05:47.835
bang that bitch in blue?

05:49.704 --> 05:51.892
You should be thanking me.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.675
I got rid of your ex.

05:54.709 --> 05:56.110
I can get rid of your current problem

05:56.144 --> 05:58.612
in much the same way.

06:08.623 --> 06:09.990
He, uh...

06:10.025 --> 06:12.660
he threatened me. And I just...
I just... I didn't...

06:13.962 --> 06:14.929
I didn't...

06:19.501 --> 06:20.501
Go, get help. We need help...

06:20.535 --> 06:21.769
No, wait, James, wait.

06:24.806 --> 06:26.106
Can you tell me your name?

06:27.175 --> 06:28.242
I hit him.

06:28.276 --> 06:30.718
He slammed his head against
the sink on the way down.

06:31.980 --> 06:33.781
Squeeze my hand.

06:34.816 --> 06:36.016
Is he moving?

06:36.051 --> 06:38.322
I think his neck is broken.

06:39.521 --> 06:40.521
Oh, God.

06:40.555 --> 06:42.122
Oh, God.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.971
You can't be here.

06:47.896 --> 06:49.630
Listen to me.

06:49.664 --> 06:50.798
- He assaulted you. - No.

06:50.832 --> 06:52.199
He threatened me. I assaulted him.

06:52.233 --> 06:53.667
No, you were defending yourself.

06:53.702 --> 06:55.703
Harlee, we don't have time
to debate this.

06:58.039 --> 07:00.474
He threw you up against this mirror.

07:00.508 --> 07:01.809
Harlee!

07:01.843 --> 07:03.577
And came at you
with this piece of glass.

07:03.612 --> 07:05.679
- I need you to leave right now.
- Not yet.

07:05.714 --> 07:07.915
I'm calling 911, and
you cannot be a part of this.

07:07.949 --> 07:08.916
I wasn't.

07:09.718 --> 07:11.852
I will not let this man hurt you.

07:11.886 --> 07:12.987
Harlee,

07:13.021 --> 07:15.194
I hurt him.

07:16.758 --> 07:19.827
You can either
explain that he stabbed you..

07:19.861 --> 07:21.829
Or I did.

07:21.863 --> 07:23.197
Won't just be me explaining.

07:23.231 --> 07:24.598
Yes, it will.

07:26.034 --> 07:27.201
Harlee, what are you doing?

07:27.235 --> 07:28.836
Harlee.

07:28.870 --> 07:30.270
He was dead when he hit the ground.

07:30.305 --> 07:31.271
That's not true.

07:34.242 --> 07:35.943
The truth is in the paperwork.

07:58.525 --> 08:00.159
Oh, my God!

08:00.194 --> 08:01.160
What happened?

08:03.197 --> 08:05.131
James, you're bleeding.

08:05.165 --> 08:06.532
Call security!

08:06.567 --> 08:07.867
Somebody get some help!

08:10.337 --> 08:12.311
I love you.

08:12.906 --> 08:14.474
Bianchi? Is there a problem?

08:14.508 --> 08:16.843
Somebody attacked him in the bathroom.

08:16.877 --> 08:18.144
We think they're still in there.

08:18.178 --> 08:20.213
We need backup to the mezzanine now.

08:20.247 --> 08:21.547
There's been an assault.

08:24.184 --> 08:26.185
What have we done?

08:26.878 --> 08:28.588
We protected each other.

08:31.091 --> 08:32.424
<i>So the mobster's not a problem anymore.</i>

08:32.458 --> 08:34.227
<i>What do you care?</i>

08:34.260 --> 08:36.162
Bianchi gets killed, we don't
have the satisfaction

08:36.196 --> 08:37.163
of taking him down ourselves.

08:37.197 --> 08:39.817
Well, at least we can
breathe a little easier.

08:42.203 --> 08:43.303
Or not.

08:43.337 --> 08:44.404
Hey, guys, come on.

08:44.438 --> 08:46.239
Can you put a sheet
over these bodies or something?

08:46.274 --> 08:48.241
- Let's go. - There's kids watching.

08:53.148 --> 08:55.482
Y'all lost the streets.

08:55.517 --> 08:56.717
Hey, Devonte,

08:56.751 --> 08:58.085
these your guys?

08:58.119 --> 08:59.720
Look at those kids.

08:59.754 --> 09:01.755
Weeks of nightmares courtesy of the 64.

09:01.790 --> 09:02.890
This ain't on us.

09:02.924 --> 09:04.792
All we do is regulate where you deal.

09:04.826 --> 09:06.760
Your personal beefs?
That's your business.

09:07.507 --> 09:09.030
I'm done here.

09:09.698 --> 09:10.798
You didn't see the shooters?

09:10.832 --> 09:12.633
Huh, no vehicle description? Nothing?

09:12.667 --> 09:14.395
Only thing I can give you

09:15.003 --> 09:16.003
is a motive.

09:18.506 --> 09:19.940
Quince.

09:19.975 --> 09:21.829
Where'd you find this?

09:22.944 --> 09:24.812
Someone put it in his hand.

09:24.846 --> 09:27.114
Guess they wanted to make sure
you got the message.

09:27.148 --> 09:29.016
Quince is coming after you.

09:29.050 --> 09:31.118
It's a personal dispute,

09:31.152 --> 09:33.087
just not with me.

09:33.121 --> 09:35.846
Tell Wozniak he has
a war coming his way.

09:39.861 --> 09:41.662
- Oh, hey. - Hey.

09:41.696 --> 09:42.696
Nate said you'd be here soon.

09:42.731 --> 09:44.031
So you're making your getaway?

09:44.065 --> 09:45.599
No, press event.

09:45.634 --> 09:46.533
It's getting close.

09:46.568 --> 09:48.602
You can't play
the underdog card anymore.

09:48.637 --> 09:50.104
We're trending in the right direction.

09:50.138 --> 09:52.039
Voters respond to strength.

09:52.073 --> 09:54.008
And I would vote for that boy of yours.

09:54.042 --> 09:55.776
How's he doing?

09:55.810 --> 09:58.212
He has your attitude towards pain.

09:58.246 --> 09:59.780
If you don't acknowledge it,

09:59.814 --> 10:01.548
it isn't there.

10:07.390 --> 10:09.892
Your mother didn't threaten
to take those away

10:09.926 --> 10:11.093
so you can get some rest?

10:11.127 --> 10:12.060
She tried.

10:12.095 --> 10:14.930
I convinced her
to go home and get some sleep.

10:14.964 --> 10:16.899
I thought we were

10:16.933 --> 10:19.991
almost out of time there for a minute.

10:20.270 --> 10:23.272
The stubborn gene comes in handy, huh?

10:23.306 --> 10:24.773
Yeah.

10:28.570 --> 10:31.839
Do you remember an article
you wrote about a year ago,

10:31.873 --> 10:33.708
hacker culture in Brooklyn?

10:33.742 --> 10:35.176
You read that?

10:35.210 --> 10:37.244
I read everything that
ever had your name on it.

10:40.782 --> 10:44.785
There's a cache data on this,
but it's encrypted.

10:44.820 --> 10:46.754
Are you in touch with any of those guys?

10:46.788 --> 10:48.856
Maybe they could help you open it,

10:48.890 --> 10:51.859
without seeing what the content is?

10:51.893 --> 10:53.027
What's on them?

10:56.898 --> 10:59.767
It's recordings that the Mob uses

10:59.801 --> 11:02.038
to blackmail people.

11:02.738 --> 11:05.940
And there might be
some names you recognize.

11:07.576 --> 11:09.076
Yours?

11:09.111 --> 11:10.544
It's possible.

11:13.782 --> 11:16.283
You know that lyric about
how everything is cracked

11:16.318 --> 11:19.024
because that's how the light gets in?

11:19.988 --> 11:21.985
Can't say that I do.

11:22.691 --> 11:24.631
It makes sense to me now.

11:25.694 --> 11:27.728
Things... break,

11:27.763 --> 11:31.232
and light forces its way
into the dark places

11:31.266 --> 11:34.802
and illuminates what matters.

11:34.836 --> 11:37.104
And what's that?

11:38.940 --> 11:40.624
Forgiveness.

11:44.780 --> 11:47.248
The man is lucky you like him.

11:47.282 --> 11:49.817
I'm not sure he feels that way.

11:49.851 --> 11:51.685
Bianchi's organization,

11:51.720 --> 11:53.254
they're not gonna hit back.

11:53.288 --> 11:54.822
They know that he went rogue

11:54.856 --> 11:57.350
and that he made this personal.

11:58.226 --> 11:59.760
I should have stayed away from Nava

11:59.795 --> 12:00.694
when he asked me to.

12:00.729 --> 12:03.998
If he really wanted
to stay away from you,

12:04.032 --> 12:05.633
he could have.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.168
The thing that pisses me off

12:07.202 --> 12:08.969
is that he deprived me of the chance

12:09.004 --> 12:11.705
of bashing Bianchi's brains in myself.

12:11.740 --> 12:13.107
It was an accident.

12:13.141 --> 12:16.311
As long as he sticks to that story.

12:17.813 --> 12:19.593
Strange thing is

12:20.315 --> 12:21.849
I almost hope he can't.

12:22.851 --> 12:24.952
I feel like I dragged him
into this world

12:24.986 --> 12:26.787
and I'm terrified that he won't get out.

12:29.825 --> 12:31.826
Hol... hold on.

12:31.860 --> 12:34.662
You did what you had to do.

12:34.696 --> 12:36.997
Most people aren't built like us.

12:37.032 --> 12:40.034
They can't pay the price
for what's necessary.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.338
Yeah?

12:52.214 --> 12:54.048
You didn't take
any painkillers, did you?

12:54.082 --> 12:56.126
No, but I wouldn't mind.

12:56.852 --> 12:59.315
You can't afford to lose your edge.

12:59.788 --> 13:01.856
Not with the questions
you're gonna have to answer.

13:01.890 --> 13:03.357
I won't put you in the middle of this,

13:03.391 --> 13:04.825
but I'm an officer of the court.

13:04.860 --> 13:06.026
I have to tell them what happened.

13:06.061 --> 13:08.762
It was him or you.

13:08.797 --> 13:09.697
That's a fact, James.

13:09.731 --> 13:12.233
It doesn't mean
it has to destroy your life.

13:12.267 --> 13:14.001
He taunted me,

13:14.035 --> 13:14.835
about Caroline.

13:14.870 --> 13:16.871
He threatened me about you. I bit.

13:16.905 --> 13:19.039
I let him get to me.

13:19.074 --> 13:21.106
And that truth can hurt you.

13:21.910 --> 13:23.043
Tell them Bianchi offered you a bribe

13:23.078 --> 13:26.013
to make his case go away,
and you told him to go to hell.

13:26.047 --> 13:27.181
All right, you were defending yourself.

13:27.215 --> 13:28.449
You had no choice.

13:35.824 --> 13:37.358
Everything is gonna be okay.

13:37.392 --> 13:39.894
Saying it doesn't make it so, Harlee.

13:39.928 --> 13:41.428
I'm... I mean, I know that.

13:41.463 --> 13:42.196
Do you?

13:42.230 --> 13:43.797
'Cause you seem pretty skilled at

13:43.832 --> 13:45.345
creating your own reality.

13:46.401 --> 13:47.801
I was doing what had to be done.

13:47.836 --> 13:48.636
You killed a man

13:48.670 --> 13:50.371
with your bare hands and covered it up.

13:50.405 --> 13:52.876
It was like a switch flipped,
and you became a...

13:54.476 --> 13:55.692
What?

13:56.244 --> 13:57.811
A stranger.

13:59.948 --> 14:01.618
What do you want to do?

14:02.317 --> 14:04.051
Read my diary?

14:04.085 --> 14:05.778
Play truth or dare?

14:06.421 --> 14:08.222
Sure, let's go. Truth.

14:08.256 --> 14:09.723
Truth.

14:09.758 --> 14:11.825
Last month, when all this
started, before Caroline,

14:11.860 --> 14:13.570
before all the madness,

14:14.329 --> 14:17.231
did you plant that weapon on Bianchi?

14:17.265 --> 14:18.832
What... you're
taking Bianchi's word now?

14:18.867 --> 14:20.734
You're the one
that wanted to play, Harlee.

14:20.769 --> 14:22.269
Is it true?

14:26.308 --> 14:28.142
There's my answer.

14:28.176 --> 14:30.177
Look, it's not that simple.

14:30.211 --> 14:31.812
Yeah?

14:31.846 --> 14:33.538
Then try this one.

14:34.215 --> 14:35.449
Who the hell are you?

14:41.506 --> 14:43.439
Never been in the precinct
without cuffs before.

14:43.474 --> 14:45.166
Figured these would
give me safe passage.

14:45.201 --> 14:47.910
Well, you know, it's a myth
that all cops like doughnuts.

14:47.945 --> 14:49.080
Well, I had to try something.

14:49.115 --> 14:50.313
Wasn't sure that anyone would believe

14:50.347 --> 14:51.775
that my little bro needed help.

14:51.810 --> 14:52.982
Oh, you'd be surprised.

14:54.218 --> 14:56.252
All right, man,
Devonte's boys got popped.

14:56.286 --> 14:59.555
What can you tell us about how
Quince runs his drug operation?

14:59.590 --> 15:00.623
You can't be serious.

15:00.657 --> 15:03.359
There were bullet holes
in a jungle gym, Wallace.

15:03.394 --> 15:05.428
I know how this works.

15:05.462 --> 15:07.430
I talk, a bunch of teenage lookouts

15:07.464 --> 15:09.432
ain't even started their lives yet

15:09.466 --> 15:10.900
catch felony charges,

15:10.934 --> 15:12.869
and the shot callers skate away free.

15:12.903 --> 15:14.037
Not today.

15:14.071 --> 15:17.040
No pawns off the board today.

15:17.074 --> 15:18.875
We're gonna go for the king.

15:18.909 --> 15:20.343
Quince is already in jail.

15:20.377 --> 15:22.545
We're not talking about court justice.

15:22.579 --> 15:24.380
Quince buys his own credit,

15:24.415 --> 15:26.516
depends on sales to pay his debt.

15:26.550 --> 15:30.019
Now, we take his product,
he has no means to survive.

15:32.589 --> 15:34.023
What you need?

15:34.058 --> 15:35.191
All right, you drove a shipment

15:35.225 --> 15:36.259
for Quince before, right?

15:36.293 --> 15:37.060
Yeah.

15:37.094 --> 15:38.294
Was it headed to the stash house?

15:38.328 --> 15:39.929
Yeah. One of three.

15:39.963 --> 15:40.730
He has three?

15:40.764 --> 15:43.132
And guards each like a fortress.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.401
Woz, I think we should
talk to Narco about this.

15:45.436 --> 15:46.436
No.

15:46.470 --> 15:48.538
This is between us and Quince.

15:48.572 --> 15:49.705
We don't have enough man power

15:49.740 --> 15:52.308
to bust three stash houses.

15:52.342 --> 15:54.310
Then we'll get him to consolidate.

15:56.313 --> 15:57.713
I'll take it from here, Lewis.

15:57.748 --> 15:58.948
You got it.

15:58.982 --> 16:00.450
Same time tomorrow, Christina.

16:00.484 --> 16:02.318
No, you're back on roll call tomorrow.

16:02.352 --> 16:04.487
The threat has been
officially neutralized.

16:04.521 --> 16:06.656
Peace of mind meant a lot. Thank you.

16:06.690 --> 16:08.817
- Yeah, thanks. - You bet.

16:10.127 --> 16:11.327
What, no armed escort today?

16:11.361 --> 16:12.728
Oh, just an armed mother.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.430
A good excuse for me to leave early,

16:14.465 --> 16:15.631
spend some time with my girl.

16:15.666 --> 16:17.985
That's what house arrest is for.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.721
You're officially up for parole.

16:21.338 --> 16:23.005
Seriously?

16:23.040 --> 16:24.240
I get the car back?

16:24.274 --> 16:26.075
For now.

16:29.346 --> 16:31.614
Bad guy that I was worried about

16:31.648 --> 16:34.557
got into a... fatal accident.

16:35.352 --> 16:36.686
What happened?

16:36.720 --> 16:38.476
Call it justice.

16:39.456 --> 16:42.172
The main thing is
we get to have our lives back.

16:43.026 --> 16:44.160
Well, good,

16:44.194 --> 16:48.364
because that ferry ride
to Jersey makes me so seasick.

16:48.398 --> 16:50.600
I would rather supervise

16:50.634 --> 16:53.269
a night of truffle fries
with you and James.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.637
Oh, I can deliver on the fries.

16:54.671 --> 16:56.335
I don't know about the rest.

16:57.207 --> 16:58.641
What?

16:58.675 --> 17:00.676
Mom, already?

17:03.013 --> 17:04.714
Too nice?

17:04.748 --> 17:06.482
Liked you too much?

17:06.517 --> 17:09.117
I-I just don't think
I'm the one for him.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.486
Well, did he say that?

17:10.521 --> 17:12.054
No, he didn't have to.

17:12.691 --> 17:14.790
He thinks I'm somebody I'm not.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.125
Don't do that.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.727
Mom, you have to give him a chance.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.797
Show him the real you.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.507
Lieutenant.

17:31.542 --> 17:32.708
You got my invitation.

17:32.743 --> 17:34.810
I did, Quince.

17:34.845 --> 17:37.713
Came to pay my respects to the dead.

17:37.748 --> 17:39.415
A little early for that.

17:39.700 --> 17:42.652
You see, prison
is kind of like Monopoly.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.555
I'm safe and sound
and still collecting money.

17:45.589 --> 17:48.357
Luck changes very quickly in our game.

17:48.392 --> 17:49.525
Don't matter.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.676
Can't stop the trade.

17:52.596 --> 17:54.764
But maybe we can both profit.

17:54.798 --> 17:57.266
That boat's already sailed.

17:57.301 --> 18:00.603
Arrest warrants for your
people and your stash houses

18:00.637 --> 18:03.039
is happening as we speak.

18:03.073 --> 18:04.440
You got to find them first.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.509
41 Ashland,

18:06.543 --> 18:08.411
216 Flushing.

18:08.445 --> 18:10.713
We identified them both.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.249
What you offering?

18:13.283 --> 18:14.550
A warning.

18:14.585 --> 18:17.119
Learn to suck real good,

18:17.154 --> 18:19.388
because once you're out of business,

18:19.423 --> 18:21.290
the protection that you get in here

18:21.325 --> 18:24.360
is gonna dry up very fast.

18:26.096 --> 18:27.730
Yeah, I'd say he was rattled.

18:27.764 --> 18:30.399
I'd put the drugs moving
within the hour,

18:30.434 --> 18:32.929
all headed to the third stash house.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.538
Yeah, okay.

18:52.155 --> 18:53.756
Ellen.

18:58.328 --> 19:00.404
How you feeling?

19:01.798 --> 19:02.765
Wait, what?

19:02.799 --> 19:04.267
Your heart rate is elevated.

19:04.301 --> 19:05.601
Not what we like to see in patients

19:05.636 --> 19:06.769
recovering from major surgery.

19:06.803 --> 19:07.770
Wait, I need that.

19:07.804 --> 19:09.639
What you need is rest.

19:09.673 --> 19:11.774
You want to go home
eventually, don't you?

19:14.177 --> 19:16.679
If you need me, you know
where the button is, okay?

19:16.713 --> 19:18.414
Try to sleep.

19:26.790 --> 19:27.623
<i>Wozniak.</i>

19:27.658 --> 19:29.659
<i>Don't ruin my day.</i>

19:29.693 --> 19:32.295
Dad, when you get this,
come to the hospital.

19:32.329 --> 19:34.733
There's something you got to hear.

19:36.266 --> 19:38.869
So what's on your mind,
Lieutenant Peters?

19:38.904 --> 19:40.871
Right now? Get them out oThat picture.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.776
It's got to have a bigger meaning to you

19:45.810 --> 19:49.780
to have these poor saps
just staring at it for an hour.

19:49.814 --> 19:50.935
A bridge.

19:50.974 --> 19:53.517
You're here, you want to get there,

19:53.552 --> 19:56.420
so you build a connection.

19:56.454 --> 19:59.790
Yeah, mental health
has never been my thing.

19:59.824 --> 20:03.359
But today was different.

20:04.496 --> 20:05.796
I got surprised.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.398
You don't strike me as a person

20:07.432 --> 20:09.700
that gets surprised very often.

20:09.734 --> 20:11.635
Are you?

20:17.676 --> 20:19.777
Got your message.

20:19.811 --> 20:21.645
What'd you find?

20:21.680 --> 20:23.781
Guess you didn't get
my last two messages.

20:23.815 --> 20:25.149
It was a...

20:25.183 --> 20:26.650
false alarm.

20:26.685 --> 20:27.885
No, I got them.

20:27.919 --> 20:29.753
But when you leave two messages

20:29.788 --> 20:31.755
saying that something's a false alarm,

20:31.790 --> 20:33.824
it's not a false alarm.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.926
What did you find?

20:36.861 --> 20:38.829
A voice I recognized.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.351
Whose?

20:41.503 --> 20:43.267
I'm sorry, Dad.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.478
<i>All this heat,</i>

20:54.512 --> 20:55.846
<i>why not get out of the city?</i>

20:56.506 --> 20:58.926
<i>If you abandon your kingdom,</i>

20:59.884 --> 21:01.852
you give up control.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.855
You stood us up the other night.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.690
The campaign takes priority.

21:06.725 --> 21:09.693
I can't control last-minute changes.

21:09.728 --> 21:11.795
Once I reach the top,

21:11.830 --> 21:14.698
I can make sure we're untouchable.

21:14.733 --> 21:16.111
I know.

21:17.535 --> 21:19.727
That's why I promise to get you there.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.706
The assassination attempt

21:22.741 --> 21:24.479
<i>did well for you.</i>

21:25.343 --> 21:27.211
Six points.

21:27.245 --> 21:29.213
I should have had her graze my shoulder.

21:29.247 --> 21:32.616
The sling would have played
so nicely in photo ops.

21:32.651 --> 21:34.218
<i>I admire the instinct.</i>

21:34.252 --> 21:35.953
<i>Always looking for an edge.</i>

21:35.987 --> 21:37.855
Just like I have the instinct now

21:37.889 --> 21:40.754
to know this isn't why
you called me here.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.461
I don't think you missed our meeting

21:44.496 --> 21:45.629
because of the campaign.

21:45.664 --> 21:47.631
I think you were warned off

21:47.666 --> 21:48.799
by Wozniak.

21:48.833 --> 21:52.336
<i>I also think you know
who put him onto me.</i>

21:52.370 --> 21:53.871
If I knew, I...

21:53.905 --> 21:56.840
No, don't try and spin this one, Julia.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.480
The FBI.

22:03.515 --> 22:05.883
They have their hooks in him deep.

22:05.917 --> 22:07.718
<i>The FBI?</i>

22:07.752 --> 22:10.554
And you didn't want
to share this before now?

22:10.588 --> 22:12.556
I wasn't sure.

22:12.590 --> 22:15.392
Wozniak's more of an ally
than you realize.

22:15.427 --> 22:17.761
He will never let the Feds get to me.

22:17.796 --> 22:18.962
Maybe not.

22:18.997 --> 22:22.909
But he has got no qualms about
leading them to my doorstep.

22:23.635 --> 22:25.836
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for him.

22:25.870 --> 22:28.405
I wouldn't be anywhere.

22:28.440 --> 22:29.740
Well, that's heartwarming,

22:29.774 --> 22:32.843
but he's the biggest liability you have.

22:32.877 --> 22:35.412
Well, there's you.

22:35.447 --> 22:37.281
<i>I hope you consider me</i>

22:37.315 --> 22:38.882
<i>more of a, um,</i>

22:38.917 --> 22:40.951
a sponsor.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.953
Aligned interests.

22:42.987 --> 22:45.022
And you can't keep us both.

22:45.056 --> 22:47.057
He is a good man.

22:47.092 --> 22:49.393
Say something nice at his funeral.

22:50.495 --> 22:53.931
Oh, come on, Julia,
you know it has to be done.

22:53.965 --> 22:55.799
So what?

22:55.834 --> 22:58.402
You brought me here
to ask for my approval?

22:58.436 --> 22:59.703
<i>No.</i>

22:59.738 --> 23:01.038
<i>I'm giving you a heads-up.</i>

23:01.072 --> 23:04.742
<i>I know all about your
occasional late-night visits.</i>

23:04.776 --> 23:07.578
Don't find yourself
at Wozniak's house tonight.

23:07.612 --> 23:10.080
His house? He doesn't live alone.

23:10.115 --> 23:12.483
<i>Oh, he signed up for collateral damage</i>

23:12.517 --> 23:13.984
a long time ago.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.653
Wozniak lives by a code.

23:16.688 --> 23:19.123
If you violate his home,

23:19.157 --> 23:20.324
his family,

23:20.358 --> 23:22.092
he'll come after you.

23:22.127 --> 23:23.894
Are you saying

23:23.928 --> 23:25.429
that you choose him?

23:25.463 --> 23:27.117
I am saying...

23:32.370 --> 23:34.605
You better not miss.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.512
<i>Mr. Nava, thanks for coming in.</i>

23:41.546 --> 23:42.646
<i>I know it's been a rough day.</i>

23:42.680 --> 23:44.515
<i>For the record,
you're waiving your right</i>

23:44.549 --> 23:45.582
<i>to have your attorney present.</i>

23:45.617 --> 23:47.751
I don't need an attorney
to tell you what happened.

23:47.786 --> 23:49.953
Your prior contact with Michael Bianchi,

23:49.988 --> 23:52.089
that was in the context
of your job as an ADA?

23:52.123 --> 23:54.158
Yes. Prosecution for assault.

23:54.192 --> 23:56.235
The case was dismissed.

23:56.961 --> 23:59.696
Your ex-girlfriend was gunned down

23:59.731 --> 24:02.866
by a man allegedly
working for Mr. Bianchi.

24:02.901 --> 24:04.468
Is that correct?

24:04.502 --> 24:06.670
Caroline Winston. We'd been engaged.

24:06.704 --> 24:08.705
Did Bianchi seek you out
in the courthouse,

24:08.740 --> 24:09.940
or did you make contact with him?

24:09.974 --> 24:11.708
He came looking for me.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.143
Was it to discuss that prior incident?

24:14.579 --> 24:16.847
Come on, James. You can do this.

24:16.881 --> 24:18.682
Mr. Nava?

24:18.716 --> 24:21.552
Did Bianchi say why he wanted
to speak to you in private?

24:24.422 --> 24:25.874
<i>He, um...</i>

24:27.091 --> 24:28.559
he offered me a bribe,

24:28.593 --> 24:31.061
help make this latest charge go away.

24:33.531 --> 24:35.020
<i>And what was your response?</i>

24:36.100 --> 24:38.101
I told him to go to hell.

24:41.949 --> 24:43.615
He attacked me.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.951
He stabbed my arm.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.053
Came at me again, I pushed him back.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.821
So much violence.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.823
His head hit on the sink.

24:51.858 --> 24:52.891
Then what happened?

24:52.925 --> 24:54.726
I went to get help.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.728
<i>I-I-I tried saving him.</i>

24:56.763 --> 24:58.797
Taking notes on how to be a detective?

24:58.831 --> 25:00.699
I was defending myself.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.000
Are you currently in a relationship

25:02.035 --> 25:03.735
with Detective Harlee Santos?

25:03.770 --> 25:04.770
What?

25:04.804 --> 25:06.738
<i>Law enforcement is a small town.</i>

25:06.773 --> 25:08.206
<i>Hard to keep things quiet.</i>

25:08.241 --> 25:09.708
Yes, we're dating.

25:09.742 --> 25:12.044
Was Detective Santos
present at the courthouse?

25:12.078 --> 25:13.845
She was, for the arraignment.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.747
Did she go in the bathroom?

25:17.717 --> 25:19.118
No.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.665
She ran over when I called for help.

25:25.058 --> 25:26.725
Learn anything?

25:26.759 --> 25:28.494
Always.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.032
Uh, Loman said Quince took the bait.

25:34.067 --> 25:36.068
His other two stash houses
are cleaned out.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.003
They're following the carrier here.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.672
- Are they close? - Couple streets away.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.774
And Wallace is sure the
runner's gonna come this way?

25:42.809 --> 25:44.776
As soon as the house spots police, yeah.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.411
Smart system.

25:46.446 --> 25:47.946
Unless some detectives are waiting to

25:47.980 --> 25:49.948
take your entire supply.

25:49.982 --> 25:52.718
Yo, pipe down up there, Woz.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.095
Huh?

25:55.254 --> 25:56.722
What?

26:10.436 --> 26:12.070
Hey, yo, you lost?

26:12.105 --> 26:13.905
Actually, yeah, maybe
you could help. Sorry.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.774
Is this address right?

26:15.808 --> 26:16.908
Police. On the ground.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.143
Yo, five-O! Police, five-O!

26:19.145 --> 26:21.713
Okay, Espada and Loman
announced themselves.

26:21.748 --> 26:22.881
Won't be long now.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.885
There it is.

26:26.919 --> 26:27.953
Police! Drop the bag!

26:27.987 --> 26:29.321
Drop it right now!

26:32.158 --> 26:34.993
<i>♪ It turns me on...</i>

26:37.029 --> 26:39.164
- Yo, Woz.
- All right, Woz, that's enough.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.288
You know, my buddy's a lawyer?

26:45.322 --> 26:47.072
He specializes in workplace harassment.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.908
Says office romances
paid for his summer house.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.410
Yeah, can I get his number?

26:51.444 --> 26:53.678
There's this creep
who hangs out at my desk.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.013
Hey.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.782
I'd like to talk to you
about what happened.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.728
Not the day, Verco.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.953
Mills was supposed to leave me a file.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.756
Oh. Hell of a read.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.026
You know, I studied forensics

27:08.060 --> 27:10.111
before I joined Internal Affairs.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.264
Turns out I prefer dealing with folks

27:12.298 --> 27:13.832
that are still alive, you know?

27:13.866 --> 27:15.700
Yeah. You're a real people person.

27:15.735 --> 27:19.009
It's amazing what you can
learn from the smallest things.

27:20.206 --> 27:21.773
For instance,

27:21.808 --> 27:22.941
fabric fibers.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.810
If everything Nava's saying is true,

27:24.844 --> 27:27.179
Bianchi's jacket should be covered

27:27.213 --> 27:30.015
in fibers from Nava's vest.

27:30.049 --> 27:32.184
It's all in the details, right?

27:32.218 --> 27:33.952
Right.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.341
But...

27:36.088 --> 27:38.457
I guess we'll have to
wait until tomorrow.

27:41.494 --> 27:44.896
The M.E. won't get to
the autopsy until morning.

27:44.931 --> 27:46.198
Why are you telling me this?

27:46.232 --> 27:48.066
Because details matter.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.734
You're right about that.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.070
The rest is just a scare tactic.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.005
Good luck, Detective.

27:57.577 --> 27:58.844
Rough collar?

27:58.878 --> 28:01.079
The runner resisted.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.914
Resisted what? Running into your fist?

28:02.949 --> 28:05.250
No, that he was unsuccessful.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.486
What's going on with Julia?

28:07.520 --> 28:09.190
What?

28:13.092 --> 28:15.360
I'm gonna go see about some loose ends.

28:18.464 --> 28:19.674
Hey.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.737
You, um,

28:22.368 --> 28:24.482
think you can lend a girl a scotch?

28:28.808 --> 28:31.943
Thought you'd be acquiring
the taste of champagne.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.211
It's not what you drink.

28:33.246 --> 28:35.280
It's who you drink it with.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.700
No need to butter me up, Julia.

28:39.552 --> 28:42.365
We've known each other too long.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.256
Yeah, we have.

28:48.294 --> 28:50.362
Are you okay?

28:50.728 --> 28:54.566
I thought I'd get a chance
to off Bianchi myself.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.901
Yeah.

28:55.935 --> 28:59.571
That ADA sure did us all a service.

28:59.605 --> 29:01.540
Well, you're out from under his thumb.

29:01.574 --> 29:02.541
Mm-hmm.

29:02.575 --> 29:04.309
Let's just say

29:04.343 --> 29:06.945
I haven't had to reach for any tissues.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.983
I was thinking...

29:12.018 --> 29:15.086
about Anna Kate today.

29:16.622 --> 29:19.937
About the time that
she tried to sneak out.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.329
She was 12.

29:24.964 --> 29:28.996
The screen from the window
was outside on the ground.

29:29.869 --> 29:33.171
And she had mud all over her shoes.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.301
Hmm.

29:34.335 --> 29:37.008
The kid forgot that her dad's a cop,

29:37.043 --> 29:39.578
a cop who's seen

29:39.612 --> 29:42.647
what could happen when a kid sneaks out.

29:42.682 --> 29:44.314
Mm, yeah.

29:45.051 --> 29:47.319
We've all seen that.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.391
I told Linda I was gonna strangle her.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.028
But I didn't get the chance because...

29:57.063 --> 29:59.364
She came down,

29:59.398 --> 30:02.434
and she admits everything.

30:02.468 --> 30:05.337
She had these tears in her eyes,

30:05.371 --> 30:10.041
and all the... the... the...

30:10.076 --> 30:14.045
anger inside

30:14.080 --> 30:17.983
just melted away.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.283
She came clean

30:22.088 --> 30:25.228
without knowing that she was caught.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.059
She really was a great kid.

30:28.094 --> 30:29.060
Yeah.

30:33.532 --> 30:34.499
So...

30:38.604 --> 30:40.505
What do you need?

30:40.539 --> 30:43.074
There was a, uh, break-in

30:43.109 --> 30:46.244
at Bianchi's lawyer's office
two days ago.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.580
Thieves cracked the safe,

30:48.614 --> 30:52.017
made off with a box
that belonged to him,

30:52.051 --> 30:54.719
totally clean.

30:57.256 --> 30:58.923
Sounds like a, uh,

30:58.958 --> 31:00.258
a pro job.

31:00.292 --> 31:04.229
Bianchi kept dirt on
pretty much every player

31:04.263 --> 31:06.097
in the city.

31:06.132 --> 31:09.267
I need to know if there is anything

31:09.301 --> 31:11.436
on my opponent.

31:11.470 --> 31:14.239
So you could feed it to the press.

31:14.273 --> 31:17.108
This race is gonna be
one of the closest in history,

31:17.143 --> 31:19.744
so what benefits me benefits you.

31:19.779 --> 31:21.713
It benefits everyone.

31:23.783 --> 31:26.168
There's nothing on Daniels.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.953
What about me?

31:32.124 --> 31:34.459
I'll take care of it.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.699
Harlee, what are you doing?

31:40.733 --> 31:43.702
Please just don't stop me,
or I won't be able to do this.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.029
You want the truth.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.144
Yes.

31:53.179 --> 31:55.688
I planted that weapon on Bianchi.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.383
And Caroline got killed because of it.

31:58.417 --> 32:02.053
I asked my friend Caddie
to keep a secret for me,

32:02.088 --> 32:03.722
and he got killed because of it.

32:03.756 --> 32:05.156
Harlee, what...

32:05.191 --> 32:06.488
There's more.

32:07.193 --> 32:08.727
Miguel came to my house.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.061
Miguel, he's back in town?

32:10.096 --> 32:11.128
No.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.998
The night before I told you he left,

32:14.033 --> 32:15.667
he came to my house.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.519
And he said he was gonna hurt Christina.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.954
He held a gun to my head.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.810
And he kissed me so hard that I...

32:25.845 --> 32:28.075
That I tasted blood.

32:29.171 --> 32:31.318
He forced himself on me.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.018
And then he started to...

32:34.053 --> 32:35.019
You don't have to say anything else...

32:35.054 --> 32:37.522
No, you need to hear this.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.301
I let him...

32:44.230 --> 32:46.157
do what he was doing.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.834
And then when he dropped his guard...

32:52.404 --> 32:54.548
I snapped his neck...

32:56.642 --> 32:58.777
with these two hands.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.514
Then I wrapped his body

33:02.548 --> 33:04.682
in a shower curtain,

33:04.717 --> 33:06.484
and I buried him.

33:20.599 --> 33:23.906
Now every time I cook
breakfast in that kitchen,

33:24.837 --> 33:26.945
I see his face.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.708
I feel his breath on my neck.

33:33.279 --> 33:35.619
And every lie I have to tell...

33:37.987 --> 33:40.402
no matter how much it costs me,

33:41.520 --> 33:44.162
no matter how much it kills me inside,

33:44.890 --> 33:47.315
if I can be telling the truth

33:48.260 --> 33:50.361
when I tell my daughter

33:50.396 --> 33:52.530
that she is safe...

33:55.568 --> 33:58.770
Every lie is worth it.

34:02.942 --> 34:05.109
Every little bit of hope

34:05.144 --> 34:06.929
that I have...

34:09.215 --> 34:11.056
is here with you.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.594
My future...

34:16.889 --> 34:19.190
is here with you...

34:22.661 --> 34:24.706
If you want it.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.601
You wanted to know who I am.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.206
Well, now you see me...

34:36.641 --> 34:38.502
all of me.

34:44.617 --> 34:46.684
Your move.

34:50.842 --> 34:52.230
You have a family, Lieutenant?

34:52.264 --> 34:54.645
I have a wife

34:54.679 --> 34:56.647
and two kids.

34:56.681 --> 34:58.516
Do they know you're here?

34:58.550 --> 35:02.105
My wife stopped
asking me to talk to someone.

35:02.139 --> 35:04.233
How long has she been asking you?

35:05.319 --> 35:06.406
Ten years.

35:06.441 --> 35:08.308
That's a long time.

35:08.343 --> 35:10.771
So what happened ten years ago?

35:11.513 --> 35:13.447
I lost my daughter.

35:14.983 --> 35:16.500
I'm sorry.

35:18.586 --> 35:20.588
You sold her

35:21.322 --> 35:23.590
ten Oxy pills.

35:25.627 --> 35:28.002
She took nine.

35:29.197 --> 35:30.963
And she died.

35:31.499 --> 35:33.600
But here's what you don't know,

35:33.635 --> 35:36.103
is when my son

35:36.137 --> 35:39.157
was beating you half to death...

35:40.341 --> 35:42.409
he did you a favor.

35:42.443 --> 35:44.851
He saved your life...

35:45.613 --> 35:48.916
'cause I was waiting for you
in your apartment.

35:48.950 --> 35:50.350
If you knew who I was,

35:50.385 --> 35:51.518
why didn't you...

35:51.553 --> 35:53.620
Why haven't I killed you yet?

35:55.023 --> 35:56.823
My anger

35:56.858 --> 35:59.835
is the bridge that connects me
to my daughter.

36:00.796 --> 36:03.214
So, if I was to kill you,

36:03.998 --> 36:07.000
it would be letting go of my daughter.

36:09.237 --> 36:11.332
If anybody comes to you

36:12.340 --> 36:15.509
and asks you about what happened...

36:15.543 --> 36:17.444
I have nothing to tell them.

36:18.346 --> 36:21.515
I never even saw
the person who did this.

36:21.549 --> 36:23.547
Now you have.

36:24.352 --> 36:26.453
This is my son.

36:26.478 --> 36:29.656
If anyone asks you

36:29.691 --> 36:32.822
about who did this to you...

36:34.562 --> 36:36.463
I need a denial.

36:36.497 --> 36:38.565
This wasn't the guy.
Looks nothing like him.

36:43.438 --> 36:45.872
Then I guess our hour's up.

36:47.108 --> 36:51.011
<i>♪ Ain't no salvation here</i>

36:54.415 --> 36:57.050
<i>♪ And the things they know</i>

37:07.595 --> 37:12.566
<i>♪ Hope has flown away</i>

37:14.135 --> 37:16.937
<i>♪ Here it goes</i>

37:37.392 --> 37:40.994
<i>♪ Here it comes</i>

37:45.633 --> 37:47.434
Hell of a day.

37:47.468 --> 37:49.436
Hell of a night.

37:49.470 --> 37:50.737
Nobody's home.

37:50.772 --> 37:53.140
I hadn't even knocked.

37:53.174 --> 37:54.574
Why not?

37:57.478 --> 38:00.447
I wasn't sure how to say

38:00.481 --> 38:03.083
what I need to say.

38:04.452 --> 38:06.620
Well, you're in good company.

38:06.654 --> 38:08.917
I spent half the day
trying to figure that out.

38:10.258 --> 38:12.459
<i>So Quince won't be
getting much sleep tonight?</i>

38:12.493 --> 38:15.329
No.

38:15.363 --> 38:16.670
No, but the...

38:17.498 --> 38:20.448
The streets of Brooklyn
will get some rest.

38:22.603 --> 38:24.438
Look away for one minute,

38:24.472 --> 38:26.729
and everything changes.

38:30.378 --> 38:32.646
Open your eyes,

38:32.680 --> 38:35.482
and you see something
for the first time.

38:37.518 --> 38:39.615
Like her.

38:41.222 --> 38:42.431
Her who?

38:43.191 --> 38:44.638
Julia.

38:45.693 --> 38:47.454
Bianchi...

38:47.795 --> 38:49.629
kept a recording.

38:52.667 --> 38:53.700
What'd you hear?

38:53.735 --> 38:55.602
I didn't see it.

38:55.636 --> 38:57.693
I didn't want to see it.

38:58.039 --> 39:00.374
But I covered Nate just in case.

39:00.408 --> 39:02.526
Woz, what didn't you see?

39:03.077 --> 39:05.679
She doesn't exist, the Julia I knew.

39:09.650 --> 39:11.822
The assassination attempt,

39:12.253 --> 39:13.758
it was staged.

39:14.188 --> 39:16.525
She knew it was gonna happen

39:17.158 --> 39:20.293
<i>and</i> the shooting at my house.

39:23.398 --> 39:24.958
No.

39:25.516 --> 39:26.500
No.

39:26.534 --> 39:28.702
I mean, J... Julia may cross some lines,

39:28.736 --> 39:30.704
but she would never do that.

39:33.241 --> 39:34.574
She loves you.

39:34.609 --> 39:36.643
So did you.

39:37.512 --> 39:39.546
And now she's gonna be the mayor

39:39.580 --> 39:41.715
because "Julia wouldn't do that."

39:41.749 --> 39:43.483
But I heard it.

39:43.518 --> 39:45.652
I heard everything.

39:51.526 --> 39:53.527
Does she know you know?

39:53.561 --> 39:55.734
She will.

40:02.437 --> 40:04.404
What are you gonna do?

40:11.279 --> 40:13.070
I'm gonna forgive.

40:14.882 --> 40:16.550
Before you even talk to her?

40:16.584 --> 40:18.742
Not Julia.

40:19.420 --> 40:23.288
She made choices to serve her ambition.

40:25.493 --> 40:27.932
You made yours...

40:29.110 --> 40:31.298
to protect your little girl.

40:58.826 --> 41:01.795
I'm sorry.

41:01.829 --> 41:04.631
Sometimes...

41:04.665 --> 41:06.904
when everything's cracked...

41:08.769 --> 41:11.217
that's how the light gets in.

41:12.707 --> 41:16.015
And it shows you the way
out of the darkness,

41:16.379 --> 41:18.714
if you let it.

41:20.548 --> 41:22.883
You think we can make it out?

41:24.986 --> 41:27.511
I think we already have.

41:35.296 --> 41:37.112
I know it's crazy, but...

41:38.699 --> 41:41.880
sometimes I feel like
he's still out there...

41:42.503 --> 41:45.705
like Miguel is waiting to find me.

41:45.740 --> 41:48.675
Where did you put his body?

41:48.709 --> 41:52.512
<i>You know that abandoned camp up 87...</i>

41:52.547 --> 41:54.981
where we used to take Christina
<i>when she was little</i>

41:55.016 --> 41:57.350
<i>to look at the stars?</i>

41:57.385 --> 41:58.922
<i>That's where I left him.</i>

41:59.314 --> 42:01.314
<i>That place is too good for Miguel.</i>

42:01.517 --> 42:03.517
<i>I didn't have a lot of time.</i>

42:03.556 --> 42:07.412
<i>I couldn't remember a place so quiet.</i>
