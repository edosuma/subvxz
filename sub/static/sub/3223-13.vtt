WEBVTT

00:03.600 --> 00:06.444
Some asshat pops out of my closet
asking about my dad.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.284
- Henry Winchester.
- Our grandfather.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.848
My father and his father before him
were both Men of Letters.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.288
- As John and you two should have been.
- Our father taught us how to be hunters.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.241
- Okay. What's that?
- I wish I knew.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.484
I'm beginning to gather
I don't make it back from this time.

00:21.640 --> 00:26.441
In the box is the key to every object,
scroll, spell...

00:26.600 --> 00:29.524
...ever collected in a thousand years
under one roof.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.250
Take it to these coordinates.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.724
- Chances that place is still standing?
- Chance we gotta take, I guess.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.440
When's the last time
someone was in this place?

04:08.720 --> 04:10.688
Sixty-five, 70 years ago?

04:45.280 --> 04:47.487
Son of a bitch.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.449
Look at this.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.723
Ham radio, telegraph, switchboard.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.530
This was their nerve center.

04:58.680 --> 05:02.446
Henry did say that they ran dispatch
on their own team of hunters.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.840
Oh, halfway through their coffee
and a game of chess.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.283
Looks like whoever was manning the hub
left quick.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.881
On the alarm call
that ended the Men of Letters.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.121
Son of a bitch.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.726
Sammy, I think we found the Bat Cave.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.882
Get thee behind me, Satan

06:16.520 --> 06:18.170
Morning.

06:18.880 --> 06:19.961
Morning.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.851
Ah, the, uh...

06:23.000 --> 06:27.881
...water pressure
in the Letters' shower room is marvelous.

06:28.040 --> 06:32.489
Yeah, I still can't figure out
how we even have water. Or electricity.

06:32.880 --> 06:37.090
Yeah, well, I am putting that
under the "ain't broke" column.

06:37.840 --> 06:41.526
Listen, little brother,
let's not go all geek on this stuff, okay?

06:41.680 --> 06:43.284
Geek?

06:44.640 --> 06:47.769
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong...

06:49.360 --> 06:50.885
...this stuff is awesome, heh.

06:51.400 --> 06:55.041
And it looks like they ran a real tight
outfit here. But I'm just saying...

06:55.200 --> 07:00.286
...you know, don't think that they knew
some big secrets that we don't know.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.764
Dean, they were a secret society.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.207
Which means that they made crap up.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.811
And wore fezzes and sashes...

07:07.960 --> 07:12.045
...and swung around scimitars
they probably didn't even sharpen.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.160
It's very sharp.

07:16.840 --> 07:20.242
Dean, look,
I think we might have something here.

07:20.400 --> 07:24.803
Something that could help us,
help humanity. Henry certainly thought so.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.243
I mean, you know damn well
we could use a break.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.925
What if we finally got one?

07:35.120 --> 07:37.202
You gonna take off the dead guy robe?

07:51.160 --> 07:53.049
Well, well.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.487
It's so late. I didn't
expect you in at all.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.882
Three times I had to transfer the bus lines
to lose him today.

08:00.720 --> 08:01.767
Right.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.410
Your sinister friend.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.924
You don't believe me
I'm being followed, heh, heh.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.605
Nobody ever does.

08:09.800 --> 08:15.523
So, yes, I would like to see, uh,
Manuscript FD113...

08:15.720 --> 08:18.200
...from the Holtzinger Estate.

08:18.360 --> 08:22.365
Oh, my. You're going to catalog
that whole collection for us, aren't you?

08:24.040 --> 08:25.769
If I have to.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.562
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.202
This book, we need to protect it.

09:17.360 --> 09:21.001
This thing they put on me, he's too close.
I can't take this ledger with me.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.841
Of course you can't.
It's part of the special reference section.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.565
Where it will be perfectly safe.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.085
Oh.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.364
I still have 10 minutes, yes?

09:31.520 --> 09:35.969
Eight minutes before all materials
must be returned to the main desk.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.365
You're too damn fine

10:07.520 --> 10:09.045
I saw the sign

10:09.360 --> 10:11.203
For you I 'd trade it all

10:12.200 --> 10:13.611
Fly with me, slide with me

10:19.600 --> 10:21.648
Leave a message after the tone.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.485
Now, listen to me carefully.
I got no time left.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.842
I found it. I found it.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.244
When you follow me here,
you're gonna need this number. Here.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.644
Q...

11:02.000 --> 11:06.164
Why so shy? Come in.
Come in out of the cold, heh.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.642
You'll have a cup of coffee
with your old enemy, heh, heh.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.366
You Nazi piece of rubbish.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.042
You Nazi pig.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.605
Hey.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.325
Hey.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.086
So? How's Kevin doing?

11:43.240 --> 11:45.561
You know, he's okay, I guess.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.604
In his corner,
hacking out his Da Vinci code.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.163
Nothing actionable yet.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.204
- Garth says hi, by the way.
- Heh.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.289
Anything from Cass?

11:58.080 --> 12:01.323
No. Not a peep. Why? You?

12:01.480 --> 12:04.324
No. He's, uh... He's not answering.

12:05.840 --> 12:10.607
Right. Well, uh, so I have been trying to
chart out the Letters' network of hunters...

12:10.760 --> 12:14.048
...their allies, uh, affiliated groups
they worked with, kept files on.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.326
Circa 1958?

12:15.920 --> 12:18.400
Yeah. True, um, most are dead or defunct.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.562
But others, I'm not so sure.

12:20.760 --> 12:24.731
And this one
we should definitely check out.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.961
- The Judah Initiative?
- A European team.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.488
- Active during World War ll.
- Hunters fighting in a war? That's cool.

12:32.640 --> 12:36.247
Not exactly hunters, not exactly fighting,
but, uh...

12:36.440 --> 12:38.568
Rabbis. Rabbis?

12:39.880 --> 12:41.211
Really?

12:41.400 --> 12:45.485
The Letters' file on them is sketchy, but
apparently they were hardcore saboteurs.

12:45.640 --> 12:51.363
So I ran a search on the initiative's
entire roster and I got a hit.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.689
One Rabbi Isaac Bass.

12:53.840 --> 12:59.165
He was 17 years old when he joined the
Initiative and 85 years old when he died.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.124
Two weeks ago.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.444
In a college town back east. He was capped.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.568
- Capped?
- Yeah.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.649
He was there doing research...

13:08.800 --> 13:12.247
...and according to eyewitnesses
he spontaneously combusted.

13:12.920 --> 13:16.242
So this is a case.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.809
Ah, I just got back.

13:32.840 --> 13:36.526
So you worked with the late Rabbi Bass?

13:36.680 --> 13:39.365
I was a research associate
of Rabbi Bass, yes.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.285
I'm trying to complete his last paper
for publication.

13:42.440 --> 13:46.286
- I'd like to review what he was after here.
- That'd be quite a lot of material.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.329
He was here, open to close,
for almost a week.

13:48.480 --> 13:52.246
Wow. Um, how about just the stuff
he was looking at...

13:53.720 --> 13:56.963
...you know, the day he, uh, caught fire?

13:58.520 --> 14:00.568
Does shorten the list a bit.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.961
- He was a really nice old kook.
- Really nice.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.565
Kook? How so?

14:04.720 --> 14:06.768
You know, he'd talk a lot.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.241
To us, to himself, to anyone who'd listen.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.161
He was always talking about this secret war
that nobody knew was going on.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.607
Conspiracy stuff.
He was obsessed with Nazis.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.206
But he said they were special Nazis.
You know.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.401
Necromancers.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.520
Necromancers?

14:22.680 --> 14:26.401
Like from that "World of Whatever
Craft" my little brother is always playing.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.289
Nazi necromancers.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.885
It's sad, isn't it?

14:30.040 --> 14:33.123
- That old people have to go so crazy?
- I know, it is sad.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.805
Hmm.

14:38.920 --> 14:39.967
You, uh...?

14:43.480 --> 14:46.529
Sorry. You, uh, both saw the accident?

14:46.680 --> 14:48.170
I can still hear his screams.

14:48.360 --> 14:51.170
It was like the fire was alive.
Like it was attacking him.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.402
It was like watching
the most awful movie...

14:53.560 --> 14:56.609
- ...of the most terrible thing you could see.
- It was like that.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.850
Yeah.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.321
Special Agent Bolan.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.006
Oh, really?

15:23.840 --> 15:24.887
Wow.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.566
I thought you were, like, a headhunter
or something, heh.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.367
This is the second, maybe third time
I'm seeing you today.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.046
Why are you following me, Gingerbread?

15:35.760 --> 15:37.888
Oh, so we, um, heh...

15:39.480 --> 15:41.801
We didn't have a thing back there, huh?

15:44.280 --> 15:45.566
Back where? What now?

15:45.720 --> 15:47.609
I'm sorry, man. I thought...

15:48.840 --> 15:52.322
I thought we had a thing back at the quad,
you know, a little eye magic.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.686
A moment.

15:53.840 --> 15:57.367
I saw you here, figured I'd wait
until you were done with your meeting...

15:57.520 --> 15:59.648
...and then maybe we might,
uh, I don't know.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.882
Yeah. Okay, but, no.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.005
Uh, no moment.

16:04.160 --> 16:07.130
This is a federal investigation.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.124
Is that supposed to make you
less interesting?

16:12.160 --> 16:13.525
No, I'm sorry, man.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.048
I hope I didn't freak you out or anything.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.402
No, no. I'm not... Not freaked out.

16:18.560 --> 16:22.645
Just, uh, you know, a federal thing.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.528
Uh, ahem.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.045
Okay, citizen.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.891
As you were.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.530
- You have a good night.
- You...

16:32.920 --> 16:34.251
You have a... Okay.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.327
- Yeah.
- Hey.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.685
So I, uh, looked into the rabbi's research.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.605
Doesn't make a lot of sense. Um...

16:47.280 --> 16:49.567
- Bird watching.
- Huh.

16:49.720 --> 16:54.248
Well, uh, the two very hot co-captains
of the woman's volleyball team...

16:54.400 --> 16:57.324
...agree that the rabbi's death
was very unnatural.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.165
I think we still got a case.

16:59.320 --> 17:02.449
That would explain
why I have something stuck to my shoe.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.642
- You're being followed?
- Yeah, I think so.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.804
I thought I was being followed.
Turned out to be a gay thing.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.684
- What?
- Nothing.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.405
- You need a hand?
- Yes, please.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.769
- Got some place quiet?
- Visitor's parking. The boonies.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.161
I'll park in the back, 30 minutes.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.284
Hey, pal.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.970
Dean.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.410
Stop.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.202
Oh, my spleen. Unh.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.483
What the hell is that?

18:23.640 --> 18:25.369
He's a golem.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.681
He's my golem.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.365
Right.

18:41.400 --> 18:45.371
The rabbi who was murdered, Isaac Bass,
he was my grandfather.

18:45.560 --> 18:46.641
That's why we're here.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.282
When you guys started to follow up
on his case, we started following you.

18:50.480 --> 18:54.690
So, wait, what you're saying is that you
and me, we, uh, didn't have a moment?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.568
No, man. I was tailing you.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.765
I told you I was being followed.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.001
He was my gay thing-

19:02.520 --> 19:04.727
That was good. You had me there.
Very smooth.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.201
Yeah, well, smooth's just about all I got.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.888
- What?
- Unh.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.606
Yeah, that's right. Keep walking.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.607
You Chia Pet.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.604
So that's a golem?

19:19.800 --> 19:22.929
Yes, shaped from clay
and brought to life by rabbis...

19:23.080 --> 19:28.723
...to protect the Jewish people in times
of, I don't know, general crappiness.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.766
- And he's yours?
- Hardly.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.888
My grandfather left him to me.

19:35.520 --> 19:40.765
I'm the last surviving descendant of the
members of this thing, this initiative.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.445
- The Judah Initiative.
- Right. And he...

19:45.680 --> 19:47.762
Who are they to know
about the men of Judah?

19:48.840 --> 19:49.887
It's okay.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.126
We are the good guys.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.481
We're hunters.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.051
Uh, Sam and Dean Winchester.

20:00.200 --> 20:04.250
We know about the Judah Initiative because
our grandfather was a Man of Letters.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.047
Yes.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.931
The rabbis knew the Men of Letters.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.967
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.690
Take a seat.

20:24.920 --> 20:30.450
So your grandfather
was into all this supernatural stuff too?

20:30.600 --> 20:33.410
Yeah. Grandparents, mom, dad...

20:33.560 --> 20:36.609
...truckload of cousins,
the whole family was lousy for it.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.127
But we never had a golem.

20:40.080 --> 20:43.482
Right, yeah. We, uh... We grew up in it.
But you didn't?

20:43.640 --> 20:47.326
My grandfather's adventures,
the Initiative, the golem, the war...

20:47.480 --> 20:51.610
...they were the stories he told me when
I was a kid. I thought it was make-believe.

20:51.760 --> 20:56.129
So did my parents. Fantasies to help him
cope with all the horrible stuff he'd seen.

20:56.280 --> 21:00.842
Every once in a while, crazy Grandpa Bass
would come back by on one of his trips...

21:01.000 --> 21:05.130
...hand me a 20-dollar savings bond and
say, "One day you'll inherit the mantle."

21:05.320 --> 21:10.690
Sure enough, few days after he died,
this big box shows up at my apartment.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.524
He always said I'd know what to do.

21:12.680 --> 21:16.241
Which was crap
because when I opened that box...

21:16.400 --> 21:21.691
...this big, naked potato-faced lunatic
wakes up and goes crazy.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.644
I didn't go crazy.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.241
You trashed my entertainment center.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.802
- My waterbed.
- This boy knows nothing.

21:29.960 --> 21:34.602
Observes none of the mitzvahs,
labors on Sabbath, dines on swine.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.649
Everybody loves bacon.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.171
He's no rabbi.

21:42.040 --> 21:44.088
Don't start with that stuff again.

21:44.280 --> 21:47.284
Enough. Please. Quiet time.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.324
What was that? What was he saying?

21:52.480 --> 21:57.122
It's Hebrew for something like "take
charge," but I have no idea what he means.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.090
I grew up in Short Hills.
I cheated through Hebrew School.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.846
Never listened to my grandfather,
what he was saying.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.846
So, wait, he just sends you this golem
and expects you to work it out?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.446
He didn't get much chance
to prepare me, I guess.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.046
My parents,
they did everything they could...

22:12.200 --> 22:15.204
...to prevent him from screwing me up
with all his crazy talk.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.561
After the war,
my grandfather spent his life...

22:18.720 --> 22:21.724
...trying to track down something
he called The Thule Society.

22:21.880 --> 22:25.441
- The Thule Society. Right. They were Nazis.
- Nazi necromancers.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.170
Nec... Necro-who?

22:27.360 --> 22:31.490
Necromancers. Uh, witches, sorcerers,
dark magic mostly with dead people.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.160
Okay.

22:35.560 --> 22:39.406
All I know about the Thule is that they
were this twisted secret fraternity...

22:39.560 --> 22:43.929
...hell-bent on world domination that
sponsored the early days of the Nazi Party.

22:44.080 --> 22:47.163
Grandfather said the Judah Initiative
was started to fight them.

22:47.320 --> 22:50.324
And the Thule murdered
your grandfather, boy.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.130
Find them so I can do my work.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.328
Hey! Hey!

22:55.480 --> 22:57.881
We're renting here. Renting.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.570
Look.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.208
I think my golem's right.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.646
My grandfather...

23:10.040 --> 23:13.169
...he left me this message on my machine
the day he died...

23:13.320 --> 23:17.564
...and he said that he had found something
that the Thule were willing to kill him for.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.445
He said he was hiding it here
in plain sight.

23:22.600 --> 23:27.401
He left me this weird, I don't know,
equation or...

23:27.560 --> 23:30.928
It's not a phone number, or an address,
or coordinates.

23:31.080 --> 23:34.243
QL673W38.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.362
What is that? A combination?

23:41.760 --> 23:43.967
It's a call number.

23:44.640 --> 23:48.281
Library of Congress, their filing system.
They use it in college libraries.

23:48.440 --> 23:50.442
Uh, QL673.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.525
That's Sciences.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.011
Uh...

23:54.800 --> 23:57.485
Birds, I'm guessing. Heh, let's go.

24:06.680 --> 24:09.126
What, do you two just break in
wherever you go?

24:09.280 --> 24:14.047
Our dad wanted us to have a solid career
in case this hunter thing didn't pan out.

24:14.200 --> 24:18.489
Okay, if I'm right, your grandfather switched
manuscript FD113 out of the archives.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.523
I'll be right back.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.089
I owe you thanks.

24:57.880 --> 25:00.611
The rabbi led me this far...

25:00.760 --> 25:03.843
...but you took me all the way.

25:04.760 --> 25:06.444
Now, give me the ledger.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.082
- Necromancer.
- Stay here.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.287
Crap.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.411
Crap!

25:27.600 --> 25:31.605
Hey, big guy. They're both gonna die
unless we get whoever cast the spell.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.083
Come on, come on.

26:33.080 --> 26:36.448
Long live the Thule.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.006
Or not.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.522
Ow, man.

27:02.720 --> 27:06.042
The Men of Letters healed you.
They saved your life.

27:08.880 --> 27:12.009
- What are they doing?
- Burying the necromancer.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.131
It's like a bag of Legos.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.687
- Golem destroyed this guy.
- Yeah.

27:22.560 --> 27:27.327
So, uh, Thule Society necromancers aside...

27:27.480 --> 27:29.881
...what's our contingency plan on that?

27:30.080 --> 27:32.367
You mean how do we "Oh, no"
Mr. Bill over there?

27:33.080 --> 27:35.526
I mean, I'd like to think we could,
if we had to.

27:35.680 --> 27:38.763
Unless you think Aaron
can get a handle on him.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.688
Oh, my God.
These guys are psychopaths.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.085
What'd you find out?

28:00.280 --> 28:03.443
I think it's a logbook
from a Nazi compound in Belarus.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.128
It was run by the Thule.

28:07.760 --> 28:11.606
This is the Red Ledger. It was lost
in the fire that destroyed the compound.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.764
My grandfather was convinced
it had been found after the war.

28:14.960 --> 28:19.443
Well, it describes the horrible experiments
performed on the camp's population.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.285
Magical experiments.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.044
More horrible than words.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.643
You were there, weren't you?

28:32.120 --> 28:33.804
At the camp.

28:35.200 --> 28:39.205
I was made in the Ghetto of Vitsyebsk.
To tear that hell down.

28:39.400 --> 28:43.485
I broke its walls. Its men.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.161
The commandant burnt the place
to ash around me.

28:49.840 --> 28:55.165
Okay, um, what does it mean
when you tell Aaron to take charge?

28:55.360 --> 28:58.648
The boy would know
if he could consult the pages.

28:59.760 --> 29:02.366
Pages? What pages?

29:08.280 --> 29:09.486
When I was...

29:09.680 --> 29:13.287
When I was bar mitzvahed, my grandfather
gave me this little old book.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.250
It was in Hebrew.

29:16.760 --> 29:20.003
It was like an owner's manual
for a golem.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.448
- Okay, great. Get that then.
- I...

29:24.520 --> 29:26.443
I can't, exactly.

29:27.440 --> 29:31.490
When I went to high school,
I sort of drifted...

29:32.200 --> 29:37.411
...stalled getting off the academic track,
and, uh, I kind of, um...

29:39.360 --> 29:40.646
I kind of smoked it.

29:42.520 --> 29:45.888
The boy smoked the pages.

29:46.040 --> 29:49.203
They were these thin, vellumy pages.

29:49.400 --> 29:51.129
I mean, it was perfect for rolling.

29:52.840 --> 29:55.366
Look, they were driving instructions
for a clay man.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.005
Okay? It was nonsense.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.531
Okay, all right. Look, I'm sorry. Okay?

30:03.680 --> 30:06.126
Why can't you just tell me
what I don't know?

30:06.320 --> 30:10.245
It's not my place to guide the rabbi,
to teach the teacher.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.726
It's not my place!

30:24.000 --> 30:26.651
That's not super comforting, gotta say.

30:32.680 --> 30:35.411
So as far as I can tell,
these experiments...

30:35.600 --> 30:40.083
...the Thule were murdering Jews, Gypsies,
just about anybody and everybody...

30:40.240 --> 30:42.766
...then trying to magically reanimate them.

30:42.960 --> 30:46.089
They were trying to figure out a way
to bring their dead to life.

30:46.280 --> 30:50.490
Which I'm guessing they figured out
because this...

30:51.760 --> 30:55.242
This last page is a roster...

30:55.400 --> 30:57.846
...of every dead Thule member
who was reanimated.

30:59.840 --> 31:02.571
This is why they killed my grandfather?

31:03.520 --> 31:07.081
- Anything in there on how to kill it?
- Apparently, they experimented with that.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.571
Um...

31:09.240 --> 31:10.446
Head shot.

31:10.600 --> 31:15.481
But if you don't burn the body
within 12 hours, it reanimates again.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.130
Nazi bastards.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.843
The security cameras' hard drives
have all been wiped.

32:06.040 --> 32:08.327
You're sure he's been murdered?

32:08.480 --> 32:11.643
Torvald was killed here, but not by a man.

32:13.320 --> 32:19.043
I'd know more, but his ghost was forced
to depart before it could tell me.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.010
They knew enough to burn his remains.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.370
Blood?

32:53.560 --> 32:54.641
Clay.

32:57.880 --> 33:01.851
Torvald kills the
initiative's last rabbi...

33:02.040 --> 33:05.647
...and now the golem of
Vitsyebsk kills him.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.167
No, no, Garth. Not a Tool Society.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.563
Thule. T-H-U-L-E.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.927
Yeah. All right.
Call me if you find anything.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.089
All of Garth's contacts are stumped.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.766
Nobody on the circuit has heard
of the Thule Society.

33:20.920 --> 33:25.244
Whoever these people are, they've been
flying beneath the hunter radar.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.923
- Anything?
- Nothing solid.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.168
I mean, the lore is all over the place.

33:30.360 --> 33:32.601
According to one legend, um...

33:32.760 --> 33:36.287
...it can be shut down if you erase
one of the letters off its forehead.

33:36.440 --> 33:40.047
- Didn't see letters on Clayface.
- Exactly. Side-burner that. Another one.

33:40.240 --> 33:43.210
Uh, some have a scroll in their mouth
you're supposed to rip out.

33:43.360 --> 33:46.682
- Wouldn't that give him a lisp?
- They're not even supposed to speak.

33:46.840 --> 33:51.607
We do know that he took on an entire camp
full of heavily armed German soldiers...

33:51.760 --> 33:54.286
...and Thule necromancers, and won.

33:54.440 --> 33:55.805
One badass Hummel figurine.

33:55.960 --> 33:59.123
- That we have no idea how to put back.
- Great.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.282
So that's your plan?

34:02.160 --> 34:03.366
Taking out my golem?

34:05.080 --> 34:06.570
It's not a plan.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.291
We would feel a lot better
if we knew how, that's all.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.882
What makes you think you have any right
to make that decision?

34:14.800 --> 34:17.326
Believe me, if we need the right,
we will take it.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.482
Look, he may be a pain in the ass...

34:19.639 --> 34:21.130
...but he's my responsibility.

34:21.280 --> 34:24.966
Look, the golem was built to go to war.

34:25.159 --> 34:28.801
You're not trained for that.
How are you gonna take that on?

34:29.000 --> 34:30.239
I don't know.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.364
ECKHART Enough.

34:55.800 --> 35:00.601
There you are, you grim piece of work,
after all these years.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.966
Eckhart.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.802
I command you by the
covenant of your makers.

35:41.960 --> 35:45.885
Clay of Adam,
surrender your bond unto me.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.604
So you are the golem's rabbi.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.009
Heh. You woke him.

36:00.120 --> 36:02.248
But you didn't take possession of him.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.881
You write your name on the scroll, boy.

36:09.040 --> 36:12.249
That's how you yifalchunbee.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.525
I didn't know what he meant.

36:17.760 --> 36:20.411
Knowledge is power, isn't it?

36:29.080 --> 36:31.731
Now, which of you is going to tell me...

36:31.880 --> 36:36.647
...where I can find a certain Red Ledger?

36:38.040 --> 36:40.281
How about you screw yourself,
Nazi bastard?

36:42.800 --> 36:43.961
Can we...?

36:45.040 --> 36:47.441
Could we put the Nazi thing aside
for the moment...

36:47.680 --> 36:49.444
...and just talk about this like...?

36:49.680 --> 36:51.762
Nazi necromancer dicks?

36:51.920 --> 36:53.604
- Pass.
- Heh, heh.

36:53.760 --> 36:55.285
So I take it you're the commandant.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.211
The one that authorized
all those experiments.

36:58.400 --> 37:02.564
Invented those experiments, thank you.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.643
So, what about you?

37:10.800 --> 37:14.441
I mean, you're not undead.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.164
So, what'd you do,
you cast a forever-21 spell on yourself?

37:18.320 --> 37:20.846
Like your little friend at the library?

37:21.000 --> 37:24.322
His name was Torvald.
And you will suffer for that.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.287
Yeah, I gotta say, spell or no spell...

37:32.840 --> 37:36.162
...he broke easy, so...

37:45.320 --> 37:47.766
I'm sorry. So?

37:47.920 --> 37:50.526
Let me tell you what I see.

37:51.200 --> 37:55.842
A magic Jew at my feet,
not a master in sight.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.328
And finally, our secrets
secret once again.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.608
Which reminds me of a story.

38:04.800 --> 38:09.328
A Jew, two gentiles and a golem
walk into a bar.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.960
And it doesn't end
with them coming out.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.644
Fools!

38:31.320 --> 38:32.890
You can kill me...

38:33.080 --> 38:35.082
...but you will never kill all the Thule.

38:39.840 --> 38:40.921
That's a start.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.686
You okay?

38:45.640 --> 38:47.244
Yeah.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.725
Yeah.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.165
Well, now we know.

39:16.320 --> 39:20.564
Paper beats golem,
fire beats undead Nazi zombie freaks.

39:22.160 --> 39:25.642
So, what do you say, Aaron?

39:25.840 --> 39:27.842
I mean, we got a place we can keep him.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.081
No.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.844
I mean...

39:31.880 --> 39:34.167
...Eckhart might be dead,
but you heard him.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.165
The Thule are still out there.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.965
Hidden, active.

39:49.160 --> 39:51.083
It's my grandfather.

39:55.040 --> 39:57.691
He left me something important.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.484
Something only I can do.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.801
Looks like I'm the Judah Initiative now.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.885
I... I thought I did.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.329
Yes.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.844
What are you doing?

40:54.400 --> 40:58.166
Ordering. I'm making a card entry
for our copies...

40:58.320 --> 41:01.244
...from the Thule's Red Ledger
for our collection.

41:06.880 --> 41:08.211
So, uh, what?

41:09.080 --> 41:14.211
Aaron's a Jl and you're
a Man of Letters now? Is that it?

41:16.320 --> 41:19.642
To the sunny side of the street

41:20.360 --> 41:23.887
Can't you hear that pitter-pat

41:24.560 --> 41:28.724
And that happy tune is your step

41:29.200 --> 41:30.281
