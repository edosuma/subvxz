WEBVTT

00:10.244 --> 00:12.544
There's blood all over
the walls.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.313
This is a nightmare.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.647
He's crazy.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.249
I don't feel good.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.650
I hate being in my home.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.953
I think that it can cause death.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.990
We did mess around
with the Ouija board.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.927
Somebody is doing Ouija board

00:28.929 --> 00:32.831
and has somehow
summoned these things.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.533
You're busted.
Forget about it.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.035
Never seen such interaction

00:37.037 --> 00:41.173
between a living person
and a shadow person before.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.709
This is not a good situation.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.577
My name is Amy Allan.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.179
There's death here.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.914
Don't wanna go down there.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.182
I see dead people.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.284
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.953
I speak to dead people...

00:54.955 --> 00:57.756
She's definitely
a serial killer.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.558
...and they speak to me.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.727
She's going to torture them.

01:01.729 --> 01:05.531
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.666
They were all murdered.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.168
I rely on my partner.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.736
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.538
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.240
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

01:15.242 --> 01:18.811
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:18.813 --> 01:22.881
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.583
It's my job to reveal them.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.218
Who do you think
possessed you?

01:26.220 --> 01:28.387
But Steve and I
never speak...

01:28.389 --> 01:30.422
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.657
...until the very end.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.292
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.360
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:35.362 --> 01:36.862
<i>Hell,</i> no.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.530
Or time to get out.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.532
Everyone is in jeopardy.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.449 --> 01:56.715
I'm in Berthoud, Colorado.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.084
It's a small town
an hour north of Denver.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.686
I got a call from a woman
named Rebecca.

02:00.688 --> 02:04.022
Now, she sounded hysterical,
says whatever's in the house

02:04.024 --> 02:05.624
is killing her
from the inside-out,

02:05.626 --> 02:07.125
and there's nothing she can
do about it

02:07.127 --> 02:09.595
because it follows her
wherever she goes.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.463
I really hope we can
help her out.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.003
Before Amy arrives,

02:18.005 --> 02:20.973
I clear the area
of any leading information --

02:20.975 --> 02:23.942
photographs, personal items,

02:23.944 --> 02:27.980
and even religion statues
need to be covered or removed.

02:27.982 --> 02:31.149
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.392
I don't feel good.

02:42.062 --> 02:44.630
I usually open myself
to communicate with the dead

02:44.632 --> 02:48.534
a few hours before I get
to a location,

02:48.536 --> 02:51.436
but tonight, I'm very sick
and vulnerable...

02:54.074 --> 02:56.375
...so I'm opening
inside the house.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.249
I'm, like, seeing blood.

03:04.251 --> 03:06.518
There's blood all over
the walls.

03:06.520 --> 03:10.556
It looks very dreamlike.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.224
This woman's screaming
and crying,

03:12.226 --> 03:14.293
and this is a nightmare.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.768
You know, Rebecca, I talk
to a lot of scared people,

03:22.770 --> 03:26.338
and when we spoke, I can hear
the desperation in your voice.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.173
I hate being in my home.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.008
You look upset already.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.577
- You okay?
- Yeah.

03:31.579 --> 03:34.146
Okay.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.247
I got to ask a question.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.481
I mean, why don't you
just leave?

03:36.483 --> 03:39.318
I feel like whatever is here
is attached to me.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.353
Whatever it is,
it's going to follow me.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.322
Okay, So now,
do you live here alone?

03:43.324 --> 03:45.390
I live with my mom,
and I have a boyfriend

03:45.392 --> 03:48.026
that frequently
spends the night here.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.261
How long
have you lived here?

03:49.263 --> 03:50.862
I grew up here,
and I've lived here

03:50.864 --> 03:52.497
off and on throughout
my adult life.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.266
Your family
bought this house?

03:54.268 --> 03:56.068
We built it in 1984.

03:56.070 --> 03:58.637
I mean, when did the activity
start getting really bad?

03:58.639 --> 04:00.806
It got bad
about 2 years ago.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.275
What do you think
is causing all of this?

04:03.277 --> 04:05.911
A lot of fracking
started in this area.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.245
Is that close by?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.647
- It's very close...
- Okay.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.048
...like, within a mile.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.817
Now, you guys have been
here over 30 years.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.386
Do you know any history
in the area?

04:14.388 --> 04:15.854
There was a deadly car crash

04:15.856 --> 04:18.490
just across the streets
about 12 years ago.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.591
All right.
So I'll look into that.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.494
Anybody that passed away
in the house, stuff like that?

04:22.496 --> 04:24.696
My dad passed away here
about 6 months ago.

04:24.698 --> 04:25.831
- He was 82.
- Okay.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.766
What did he pass from?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.067
Kidney failure.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.602
Now did he pass away
in the house?

04:30.604 --> 04:33.939
Not in the house. He left
the house in an ambulance

04:33.941 --> 04:36.375
and died about 2 weeks later
in hospice.

04:36.377 --> 04:39.978
This was my dad probably
about 15...years ago?

04:39.980 --> 04:41.113
Okay.

04:41.115 --> 04:45.083
And this is a picture
of my dad and me.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.185
What can you tell me
about your father?

04:47.187 --> 04:49.454
He suffered for a long time
with depression.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.590
He was affected
by something here.

04:51.592 --> 04:54.359
He used to talk about
people coming to visit.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.128
So you think he was suffering
from, like, paranormal

04:56.130 --> 04:58.597
that was going on here and
didn't know how to deal with it?

04:58.599 --> 05:00.032
I think so.

05:00.034 --> 05:01.800
Have you done anything to combat
what you've been through?

05:01.802 --> 05:06.238
I've had people come to do
cleansings, exorcism.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.173
We had a demonologist
come out.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.641
That's quite a list
right there.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.709
And nothing has helped?

05:10.711 --> 05:12.944
Just for
a short period of time.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.179
I know you have a lot
going on, Rebecca,

05:14.181 --> 05:16.381
but give me a list
of what's happening.

05:16.383 --> 05:19.985
Hearing noises,
seeing weird things.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.887
It's become very violent,

05:21.889 --> 05:24.756
and I think my personality
has changed.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.124
Okay, in what way?

05:26.126 --> 05:29.027
I used to be really easygoing,
very happy all the time,

05:29.029 --> 05:33.098
and now I'm filled with anxiety
and overly sensitive,

05:33.100 --> 05:35.801
kind of turned into a...

05:35.803 --> 05:37.302
tension between
me and my mom,

05:37.304 --> 05:38.837
tension between
me and my boyfriend.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.173
And what do you hope
we can do for you?

05:41.175 --> 05:43.642
I'd like to be comfortable
in my home.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.877
I'd like to not
be getting hurt anymore.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.345
Yeah.

05:52.553 --> 05:57.823
The only thing about this area
is the, like, the energy chaos.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.959
This is all, like,
living energy stuff, you know?

06:00.961 --> 06:04.796
A male and a female arguing.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.799
The energy here is very, um,

06:07.801 --> 06:10.202
hectic and chaotic.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.472
It's too much noise.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.713
Okay. So, Rebecca,
what's going on in here?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.014
Coming into the hall,

06:23.016 --> 06:25.951
I felt something push me
on my left shoulder,

06:25.953 --> 06:27.919
so I turned to see

06:27.921 --> 06:30.288
and just so quickly

06:30.290 --> 06:32.591
went backwards over this,

06:32.593 --> 06:34.926
and left me with bruises
and scratches on my back.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.862
I mean, that's -- that's
a pretty high opening.

06:36.864 --> 06:39.097
That had to be
a pretty strong push.
Yep.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.866
Thank God there's no glass
in between here.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.834
Yeah.
All right,
so what else is going on?

06:42.836 --> 06:45.670
Just last night, I was
walking down the stairs.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.272
Something pushed me
from behind,

06:47.274 --> 06:49.841
and I fell down the stairs,
hurt my shoulder.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.143
I mean, I hate to be an ass,

06:51.145 --> 06:52.844
but, I mean,
are you clumsy at all?

06:52.846 --> 06:55.914
Not clumsy enough to make
stuff like this happen.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.583
And you wonder why your anxiety
is through the roof.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.586
I just feel like
a walking target

07:01.588 --> 07:03.789
all the time.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.725
Just...I felt sexually
assaulted in my bed.

07:06.727 --> 07:10.862
Okay. All right. Has this
happened more than once?

07:10.864 --> 07:12.497
No, just one time.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.933
It's a lot more violent
than we thought.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.536
Okay. I'm really glad
I took this case.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.970
Thank you.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.710
I'm seeing a shadow person
in here.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.612
I think it's
a real shadow person,

07:27.614 --> 07:31.249
and I see it attacking
the person in here.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.451
Usually, shadow people
are just all, like,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.921
suck the life out of you.

07:35.923 --> 07:39.991
This is, like, physically
assaulting this person.

07:42.563 --> 07:45.297
Yeah, I see a female
with brown hair.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.098
She's probably...

07:47.100 --> 07:50.735
I don't know,
in her 30s, average build.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.804
Like, I see a person laying.

07:52.806 --> 07:57.075
The shadow person is, like,
on its hands and feet,

07:57.077 --> 07:58.610
and it's <i> huge.</i>

07:58.612 --> 08:02.047
It becomes huge,
and the person's like...

08:02.049 --> 08:03.548
like, underneath it.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.189
You know, Rebecca,
after everything
you've told me so far,

08:11.191 --> 08:12.657
I'm afraid to even ask.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.925
What else is going on?

08:13.927 --> 08:17.028
I have seen
a black creature, like,

08:17.030 --> 08:19.731
with lots of long tentacles
all over it.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.299
Shiny black,

08:21.301 --> 08:24.836
no face to speak of.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.005
How big of a mass are
we talking about? Like this?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.074
Probably 4 feet.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.309
You on any medication
or anything?
No.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.010
So nothing that's making
you hallucinate?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.246
No.

08:34.248 --> 08:35.547
Okay. Anything else
going on in here?

08:35.549 --> 08:38.049
I've gotten scratches
and bruises in bed.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.251
Okay. What kind of scratches and
bruises are we talking about?

08:40.254 --> 08:41.785
Well, I have some pictures.

08:41.788 --> 08:44.689
Here's a picture
of some scratches.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.092
Jeez.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.226
I see there's blood here.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.895
I mean, I've seen cats
in the house.

08:49.897 --> 08:50.962
Cats come into bed
with you guys?

08:50.964 --> 08:52.998
Cats go in their
own room at night.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.165
All right. Anything else?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.867
One time,
I was laying in bed,

08:55.869 --> 08:58.703
and I felt like
I was punched in the face,

08:58.705 --> 09:01.539
and it was so hard that I had
a tooth knocked out.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.608
Which tooth was it?

09:03.610 --> 09:05.343
Um, this one, right here.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.848
It's insane.
I feel crazy sometimes.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.483
You have a tough go here.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.158
There's a lot of interaction
between this shadow person

09:20.160 --> 09:21.860
and this living person.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.195
This is a pretty much
every night thing,

09:24.197 --> 09:27.265
dragging them off the bed,

09:27.267 --> 09:30.669
being pushed,
pushed down to the floor,

09:30.671 --> 09:32.537
trying to take them
through the walls,

09:32.539 --> 09:34.572
which doesn't work
if you're alive.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.208
Wouldn't be surprised
if there would be bruises

09:37.210 --> 09:39.411
from being grabbed
and moved and dropped.

09:39.413 --> 09:44.683
I've never seen such interaction
between a living person

09:44.685 --> 09:48.186
and a shadow person before.

09:48.188 --> 09:52.424
I'm feeling frustration from
the shadow person,

09:52.426 --> 09:54.292
almost like the shadow person

09:54.294 --> 09:59.197
thinks this person
is another shadow person

09:59.199 --> 10:03.301
and isn't doing what
they're supposed to be doing.

10:03.303 --> 10:08.606
This is very odd behavior
from an actual shadow person.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.709
So would you say
this person is in danger?

10:10.711 --> 10:13.745
Yes. I think that...

10:15.716 --> 10:19.551
maybe the shadow person
will figure out a way

10:19.553 --> 10:23.021
to make this person disappear.

10:42.259 --> 10:44.559
So, Heidi, I know
you're friends with Rebecca.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.994
How long you guys been friends?

10:45.996 --> 10:47.462
Since I can remember.

10:47.464 --> 10:48.897
You told me you didn't want
to do the interview inside.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.165
What was that all about?

10:50.167 --> 10:51.800
I recently lost my husband,

10:51.802 --> 10:53.401
and I'm kind of
in a vulnerable place,

10:53.403 --> 10:54.702
and I just want
to protect myself

10:54.704 --> 10:56.938
from taking something home
with me.

10:56.940 --> 10:59.507
So, obviously, you think
there's something in the house.

10:59.509 --> 11:01.843
- Yeah.
- Have you had any experiences?

11:01.845 --> 11:04.279
- I have.
- Okay. Let's talk about them.

11:04.281 --> 11:06.648
When we were little,
we used to see a guy

11:06.650 --> 11:09.617
walking around in her barn
sometimes.

11:09.619 --> 11:11.953
Okay. So how do you know
it wasn't some guy in the barn?

11:11.955 --> 11:14.889
- We would go in and look.
- Okay.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.057
Could they have been hiding
when he saw you coming?

11:16.059 --> 11:18.193
No. There was really
nowhere to hide.

11:18.195 --> 11:19.794
Okay. So anything else?

11:19.796 --> 11:22.163
There was one other thing
that was sort of

11:22.165 --> 11:23.598
like an impish
little creature.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.902
It was black and white and had
sort of, like, long pointy head.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.872
Describe him to me like it's
a perpetrator from a crime.

11:30.874 --> 11:33.842
- Foot and a half tall, maybe.
- Okay.

11:33.844 --> 11:35.109
Small mouth, sharp teeth...

11:35.111 --> 11:36.344
...big eyes.

11:36.346 --> 11:37.645
So like a little monster,
really?

11:37.647 --> 11:39.481
Yeah, kind of.
Well, let me ask you
a question.

11:39.483 --> 11:41.249
Do you think your friend
is in danger?

11:41.251 --> 11:42.350
I do.

11:42.352 --> 11:44.819
I'm hoping you guys
can help her.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.658
I see a demon.

11:53.430 --> 11:54.929
Can you describe him?

11:54.931 --> 11:58.433
There's no, like, real body,

11:58.435 --> 12:00.635
but it has legs and arms.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.470
It slithers, mostly...

12:05.308 --> 12:08.977
...and it has a fat trunk
that's really long,

12:08.979 --> 12:11.112
and it slithers like a snake
on that.

12:11.114 --> 12:14.382
Its head is kind of like
a...triangular.

12:14.384 --> 12:18.653
It has, like, some kind of
ear things or something,

12:18.655 --> 12:23.958
and it has a weird, like, snout
and big yellow eyes.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.828
I think that we've got
a problem.

12:34.137 --> 12:35.470
You know, Linda,
I was talking to Rebecca.

12:35.472 --> 12:36.738
You gotta be worried
about her.

12:36.740 --> 12:38.840
I'm extremely worried
about her.

12:38.842 --> 12:42.110
I don't know how much more
she can handle.

12:42.112 --> 12:45.013
So, Linda, I understand that
your husband recently passed.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.614
Do you think he's here?

12:46.616 --> 12:50.818
I feel he's here, but I feel
it's not a negative influence.

12:50.820 --> 12:53.154
All right, as far as
experiences, what about you?

12:53.156 --> 12:57.392
Every time that I sit
in the chair behind me,

12:57.394 --> 13:00.395
I feel like someone
is sitting on my chest

13:00.397 --> 13:02.397
and I cannot catch
my breath.

13:02.399 --> 13:03.865
Okay. Listen.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.199
I know it's a lot to ask,
but can you sit in the chair?

13:05.201 --> 13:06.267
I'm just curious
if it would happen

13:06.269 --> 13:08.670
with me being in the room
with you.

13:08.672 --> 13:10.171
Of course.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.177
I don't feel good.

13:16.179 --> 13:18.947
Is it
the same pressure feeling?

13:18.949 --> 13:20.481
Yes.

13:20.483 --> 13:22.016
It is.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.217
This quick?

13:24.988 --> 13:26.821
- Okay. All right.
- It is.

13:26.823 --> 13:29.791
All right. Come on. Come on.

13:29.793 --> 13:30.925
Sorry about that. I just
wanted to see. You okay?

13:30.927 --> 13:32.160
- Yeah.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

13:32.162 --> 13:33.628
- It's okay.
- You feel better now?

13:33.630 --> 13:35.396
- Yeah. I do.
- Okay.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.498
That's why I don't spend
any time in here.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.033
Anything else?

13:39.035 --> 13:43.204
At night, we hear
very definite scratching

13:43.206 --> 13:44.672
in the outside wall.

13:44.674 --> 13:45.940
You got wildlife
all over the place.

13:45.942 --> 13:47.275
We do.

13:47.277 --> 13:50.612
Pest control people came out
and checked everything.

13:50.614 --> 13:52.447
They even went under
the house.

13:52.449 --> 13:54.382
Now you've lived here
a very long time,

13:54.384 --> 13:57.085
but I understand that
this stuff got pretty intense

13:57.087 --> 13:58.219
over the last couple
of years.

13:58.221 --> 13:59.487
All right, so what
do you think changed?

13:59.489 --> 14:03.391
Rebecca's boyfriend dabbled
in Ouija boards,

14:03.393 --> 14:06.894
and I really wonder
if that opened a door

14:06.896 --> 14:09.998
to some negative
occurrences here.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.232
Well, we're here,
so hopefully,

14:11.234 --> 14:12.467
we'll get some answers
for you guys.

14:12.469 --> 14:13.968
I hope so.

14:18.975 --> 14:21.075
Okay. So this is weird.

14:21.077 --> 14:24.679
The demon is, like,
storming in the house,

14:24.681 --> 14:28.716
and it's, like, making
a lot of noise and ruckus.

14:28.718 --> 14:33.388
I was being told that
a living person here

14:33.390 --> 14:35.623
has collected this thing.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.393
- The demon?
- Yes.

14:38.395 --> 14:41.329
I just assumed it came
from the land, you know?

14:41.331 --> 14:44.365
But, mnh-mnh, no,
somebody here...

14:44.367 --> 14:47.068
I'm getting a male.

14:47.070 --> 14:50.104
What the...are they doing,
making a demon come on up?

14:51.508 --> 14:54.609
Something is gonna happen,

14:54.611 --> 14:55.877
like a murder.

15:03.019 --> 15:04.419
So, Mike,
talking to Rebecca,

15:04.421 --> 15:06.287
I mean, she's going
through hell here.

15:06.289 --> 15:07.855
You gotta be worried
about her.

15:07.857 --> 15:08.890
I'm sickened by it.

15:08.892 --> 15:11.059
It just makes you feel
helpless.

15:11.061 --> 15:13.261
Now Rebecca told me
that no matter where she goes,

15:13.263 --> 15:14.495
this thing follows her.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.230
Now have you seen this
happen at your place?

15:16.232 --> 15:17.398
Absolutely.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.400
This one time, she was choked.

15:19.402 --> 15:21.736
She's been thrown
against my closet door.

15:21.738 --> 15:23.271
She's been thrown into
my bathtub.

15:23.273 --> 15:26.174
She's been thrown off
the back of my couch.

15:26.176 --> 15:29.577
Actually, I've got, like,
three journals like this,

15:29.579 --> 15:31.646
just account after account

15:31.648 --> 15:34.682
of things that have
happened to her.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.751
Now when I talked to Linda,
her mom.

15:36.753 --> 15:38.853
She's been here since 1984.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.855
And she said none
of this violent...started

15:40.857 --> 15:42.056
until you came into
the picture.

15:42.058 --> 15:44.058
- Absolutely. Yeah.
- So...

15:44.060 --> 15:45.927
Well, I mean, we did mess around
with a Ouija board,

15:45.929 --> 15:47.862
and we've went on
a couple ghost tours.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.363
So you only did those
two things, and that's it?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.399
Yeah, Ouija board, EVP,
and, yeah, ghost tour.

15:51.401 --> 15:53.167
- So that's three things.
- Three things, yeah.

15:54.571 --> 15:55.903
Now you understand,
if you we sit down with Amy,

15:55.905 --> 15:57.839
she's going to want to know
everything.

15:57.841 --> 15:59.340
And if you're not
telling me all of it,

15:59.342 --> 16:01.876
it's not going to help
our case here.

16:01.878 --> 16:05.213
We have contacted
a demonologist,

16:05.215 --> 16:08.316
a Reiki Master,
and then another psychic.

16:08.318 --> 16:11.152
All right, so there <i> were</i>
other things that went on here.

16:11.154 --> 16:14.622
The truth is, it doesn't matter
where Becca goes.

16:14.624 --> 16:17.792
She's a bright light
and she attracts a lot of bugs.

16:17.794 --> 16:21.829
Until she figures out how
to, you know, believe in herself

16:21.831 --> 16:25.133
and how to protect herself,
things aren't gonna change.

16:29.072 --> 16:31.372
I was being told

16:31.374 --> 16:34.876
somebody is doing Ouija board

16:34.878 --> 16:39.714
and has somehow
summoned these things.

16:39.716 --> 16:43.384
The demon has
a direct relationship

16:43.386 --> 16:45.653
with a living male here

16:45.655 --> 16:49.490
who accidentally
brought it back.

16:49.492 --> 16:51.592
Do you know
when this happened?

16:51.594 --> 16:55.630
Recently, maybe going on,
like, 50 years.

16:55.632 --> 16:57.098
Do you know what it wants?

16:57.100 --> 17:00.434
It can make them physically ill

17:00.436 --> 17:03.237
or want to kill themselves.

17:18.887 --> 17:20.354
You know, I'm gonna start
my investigation

17:20.356 --> 17:23.190
with Rebecca's lead about
the deadly car accident.

17:23.192 --> 17:25.059
Now, for some reason,
the local cops don't want

17:25.060 --> 17:27.328
to talk to me about it.

17:27.329 --> 17:29.263
So I'm heading back to meet
a local journalist

17:29.265 --> 17:31.966
who says this tragedy could've
definitely been prevented.

17:39.775 --> 17:42.309
Okay, so this accident,
what can you tell me about it?

17:42.311 --> 17:45.379
It happened in 2005, May 25.

17:45.381 --> 17:47.715
There was a carload
of four teenagers.

17:47.717 --> 17:49.583
They were coming up the road
this way.

17:49.585 --> 17:50.751
Okay.

17:50.753 --> 17:53.020
Ben Moden, he was 17 years old.
He was driving.

17:53.022 --> 17:54.522
Now was he from this area,
this kid, Moden? Or...

17:54.524 --> 17:56.423
- Yes.
- He was. Okay.

17:56.425 --> 17:58.292
Who else was in the car
with him?

17:58.294 --> 18:01.829
18-year-old Kurtis Soeby,
17-year-old Brenden McBride,

18:01.831 --> 18:04.732
and then a 15-year-old girl
named Shawntae Taylor.

18:04.734 --> 18:07.735
Okay, so describe the accident
for me. What happened?

18:07.737 --> 18:09.537
Ben and his friends were
coming up the road this way,

18:09.539 --> 18:11.272
going at a good rate of speed

18:11.274 --> 18:13.307
A pickup truck
was coming this way.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.276
Ben blew right through
this stop sign.

18:15.278 --> 18:17.144
He was trying to beat
the pickup truck.

18:17.146 --> 18:19.179
Okay, so how bad
was this wreck?

18:19.181 --> 18:22.983
It was awful, and debris
was found hundreds of feet

18:22.985 --> 18:25.686
around the crash site.
- Wow.

18:25.688 --> 18:26.921
How many people died
in this accident?

18:26.923 --> 18:29.290
One at the scene,
Shawntae Taylor, the girl.

18:29.292 --> 18:30.591
And then Kurtis Soeby,

18:30.593 --> 18:32.893
he was airlifted
to a hospital in Denver

18:32.895 --> 18:36.931
and died 3 days later
of his injuries.

18:36.933 --> 18:38.332
All right.
So what about this kid Moden?

18:38.334 --> 18:39.500
Did they charge him?

18:39.502 --> 18:40.935
They charged him
with several misdemeanors

18:40.937 --> 18:44.405
'cause he was a minor when
he was arrested at the hospital.

18:44.407 --> 18:45.940
At the sentencing,
he actually said

18:45.942 --> 18:48.309
that he wished it had
been him

18:48.311 --> 18:50.811
instead of his friends
who had died.

18:50.813 --> 18:52.246
Ultimately, he got his wish.

18:52.248 --> 18:53.547
How so?

18:53.549 --> 18:56.717
He was done with house arrest
in July of 2006.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.185
Okay.

18:58.187 --> 18:59.753
And then just 3 months later,
he was driving with a friend,

18:59.755 --> 19:03.958
21-year-old Joseph Darr,
4:00 in the morning,

19:03.960 --> 19:06.160
blasting down the highway,
loses control,

19:06.162 --> 19:09.263
flips it several times,
both ejected from the car,

19:09.265 --> 19:11.565
neither one wearing
a seat belt, again.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.935
And Joseph walked away
with serious injuries,

19:14.937 --> 19:19.773
but Ben was killed
from traumatic head injury.

19:19.775 --> 19:23.444
In his autopsy, they found
cocaine, marijuana, and ecstasy.

19:23.446 --> 19:27.081
Well, maybe if he would've done
some time in the first accident,

19:27.083 --> 19:28.716
he'd be alive today.

19:32.555 --> 19:35.789
I'm seeing an angry male,

19:35.791 --> 19:39.293
and there was something
wrong with him.

19:39.295 --> 19:43.430
Basically, he's just...crazy.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.799
I don't know what made him
crazy, though.

19:45.801 --> 19:49.470
He hurts himself
and would hurt other people.

19:51.540 --> 19:53.240
They locked him up.

19:53.242 --> 19:55.275
His face is all smooshed up.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.677
Do you know
why he's like that?

19:56.679 --> 19:58.178
His face is like that...

19:58.180 --> 20:00.481
'cause he's in pain.

20:01.984 --> 20:03.751
Rebecca says she thinks
fracking in the area

20:03.753 --> 20:05.252
may have stirred things up.

20:05.254 --> 20:08.989
Now I don't know about that,
but she got me thinking.

20:08.991 --> 20:10.891
If her water supply
got contaminated,

20:10.893 --> 20:13.961
could it be making her sick
and causing her to hallucinate?

20:13.963 --> 20:16.163
I'm heading over to meet
an environmental scientist

20:16.165 --> 20:17.898
to see if that's
even possible.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.440
My clients here have
been experiencing

20:26.442 --> 20:29.476
some serious paranormal
activity for about 2 years.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.879
I don't expect you
to get into the whole
paranormal side of things,

20:31.881 --> 20:34.515
but they said it was the time
fracking started in the area.

20:34.517 --> 20:35.849
What exactly is fracking?

20:35.851 --> 20:38.652
It's a process by which
you drill into the Earth,

20:38.654 --> 20:40.921
and you use
high-pressure water

20:40.923 --> 20:43.624
and a cocktail compound
of chemicals

20:43.626 --> 20:47.528
to bring oil out of
solid rock in the ground.

20:47.530 --> 20:49.763
They're fracking pretty close
here, from what I understand.

20:49.765 --> 20:52.599
They are, so about 100 yards
from here is Weld County,

20:52.601 --> 20:56.770
and there are 15,000 fracking
wells in Weld County alone.

20:56.772 --> 20:59.740
Now, have there been any leaks
around here that you know of?

20:59.742 --> 21:04.178
Sure. Within the county, there
was a 28,000-gallon oil spill

21:04.180 --> 21:07.181
associated with fracking
in the past year.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.450
Okay. So if they're drinking
contaminated water

21:09.452 --> 21:10.751
for an extended period
of time,

21:10.753 --> 21:12.720
what's the symptoms
gonna be like?

21:12.722 --> 21:15.422
So you're going to see
headaches, anxiety,

21:15.424 --> 21:17.524
dizziness, delirium,

21:17.526 --> 21:19.493
and for more extended
periods of time

21:19.495 --> 21:21.161
and in higher doses
of chemicals,

21:21.163 --> 21:24.398
you'd see things like cancer
and potentially even death.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.401
So it'd probably be a good idea
for me to test the water?

21:27.403 --> 21:29.336
I would certainly
recommend that.

21:29.338 --> 21:31.038
Okay.

21:33.075 --> 21:36.110
I'm seeing that demon again.

21:36.112 --> 21:39.079
I saw this thing

21:39.081 --> 21:42.983
in the drainage ditch outside.

21:42.985 --> 21:47.387
It inhales water,
and it comes inside,

21:47.389 --> 21:52.926
and it'll go on the person
and then vomit into their back,

21:52.928 --> 21:57.131
and then the evil
is always in their backs.

21:57.133 --> 22:00.467
This causes the living here

22:00.469 --> 22:03.537
to either get sick

22:03.539 --> 22:06.573
or kill themselves.

22:08.611 --> 22:14.348
The person then can spread it
to other living people.

22:14.350 --> 22:16.750
- Just by being around them?
- Yes.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.520
Just how sick can it
make people?

22:19.522 --> 22:21.989
I think that it can cause death.

22:29.365 --> 22:31.698

22:40.676 --> 22:41.909
and we'll help if we can.

22:51.929 --> 22:54.029
So far, I've got a client
under attack,

22:54.031 --> 22:56.365
on our property near the site
of a deadly car crash

22:56.367 --> 22:58.534
that killed two teenagers,

22:58.536 --> 23:00.469
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

23:02.473 --> 23:03.672
Searching through old records,

23:03.674 --> 23:05.140
I find an article about

23:05.142 --> 23:06.708
a farmhand
who was brutally murdered

23:06.710 --> 23:10.012
right next door
to my client's property.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.413
You know,
I got a local crime writer

23:11.415 --> 23:13.148
to look into this murder for me.

23:13.150 --> 23:15.651
Now, she told me the case
took a big twist

23:15.653 --> 23:18.754
when the local judge made
a surprising announcement.

23:25.863 --> 23:26.962
Well, Chris,
thanks for meeting with me.

23:26.964 --> 23:28.664
- I appreciate that.
- Sure.

23:28.666 --> 23:31.633
Before we get to the homicide,
where exactly did it happen?

23:31.635 --> 23:34.136
It happened on
an 800-acre farm

23:34.138 --> 23:36.371
right next door
to your client's property.

23:36.373 --> 23:39.875
The farm was owned by a man
named Louis Clinton Rockwell

23:39.877 --> 23:42.978
who was an attorney
who lived in Denver.

23:42.980 --> 23:44.313
Now, Chris, I know
in the article it said

23:44.315 --> 23:46.214
it involved farmhands.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.816
All right.
What do we know about them?

23:47.818 --> 23:50.118
These guys were
Swedish immigrants,

23:50.120 --> 23:52.788
and they lived in a barn
on the property.

23:52.790 --> 23:56.525
They're young, single,
sort of drifters that come in

23:56.527 --> 23:58.727
and work in the summer
and then leave.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.963
Okay, Chris, so do me a favor.
Let's go through the homicide.

24:00.965 --> 24:02.097
What happened?

24:02.099 --> 24:05.267
Well, on the night
of November 11, 1889,

24:05.269 --> 24:07.035
the farmhands were in the barn.
- Okay.

24:07.037 --> 24:09.538
And they were down
in the lounge area, drinking.

24:09.540 --> 24:13.108
And about 8:00,
one of them, Albert Martin,

24:13.110 --> 24:15.510
decided he was going to go
upstairs and go to bed,

24:15.512 --> 24:18.647
and the rest of them stayed down
and continued to get hammered.

24:18.649 --> 24:20.816
Okay, which guys like that
are gonna do 'cause,

24:20.818 --> 24:22.618
you know, there's
nothing else to do there.
Right. Right.

24:22.620 --> 24:26.822
And later on in the evening,
Elmer Robb, one of the men,

24:26.824 --> 24:28.090
who was a really big guy,

24:28.092 --> 24:30.993
decided that he wanted
the others to fist-fight

24:30.995 --> 24:32.327
for his amusement.

24:32.329 --> 24:34.663
He was badgering them
and threatening them,

24:34.665 --> 24:36.865
and finally,
one person did agree,

24:36.867 --> 24:39.301
and so he decided
to go upstairs

24:39.303 --> 24:42.270
and get Martin to come down
and fight the guy.

24:42.272 --> 24:43.372
All right.
So this guy is already in bed.

24:43.374 --> 24:44.806
How did they react to that?

24:44.808 --> 24:48.343
At that point, Martin, feeling
kind of threatened, got up,

24:48.345 --> 24:52.714
grabbed a.32-caliber revolver,
and went downstairs with him.

24:52.716 --> 24:54.750
And he feels that
he's threatened.

24:54.752 --> 24:56.184
Robb's a big guy.

24:56.186 --> 24:58.220
So he pulls out
his.32-caliber

24:58.222 --> 25:00.522
and shoots him
three times in the chest.

25:00.524 --> 25:03.592
- And he kills him?
- Yes.

25:03.594 --> 25:04.960
That's funny, though.
You mentioned on the phone,

25:04.962 --> 25:07.396
there was a surprising decision
by the judge.

25:07.398 --> 25:08.864
Right.

25:08.866 --> 25:10.766
Well, the sheriff felt that
they had the guy dead to right,

25:10.768 --> 25:12.834
so they wanted to
charge him with murder.

25:12.836 --> 25:14.870
- Okay.
- But the judge totally disagreed

25:14.872 --> 25:19.074
and refused to arraign him
and let him go.

25:19.076 --> 25:20.308
All right,
so it sounds like

25:20.310 --> 25:21.810
the judge thought it was
self-defense.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.445
Right.
Robb's sort of a jerk.

25:23.447 --> 25:25.814
He probably deserved
what he got, really.

25:28.886 --> 25:32.087
There's, like,
a couple of men out here,

25:32.089 --> 25:34.022
and they're dead,

25:34.024 --> 25:36.358
and they're not good.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.593
I don't even know
what they're doing here.

25:38.595 --> 25:40.862
They're not from here.

25:40.864 --> 25:42.197
So how many are there?

25:42.199 --> 25:46.535
I think there's three,
but there could be more.

25:46.537 --> 25:48.003
Do you know
when this is from?

25:48.005 --> 25:50.706
I'd say
in the last hundred years.

25:50.708 --> 25:51.907
There'll all white men.

25:51.909 --> 25:57.646
They're probably ranging
from age 18 to 40.

25:57.648 --> 25:59.047
There's a skinny one.

25:59.049 --> 26:01.216
There's a built one.

26:01.218 --> 26:02.818
I don't know how they died.

26:02.820 --> 26:06.221
I hear one was executed.

26:06.223 --> 26:08.356
I know they killed somebody.

26:11.628 --> 26:13.895
I think that they would cause
a lot of activity

26:13.897 --> 26:16.531
in that building.

26:16.533 --> 26:20.001
I do think that the living
have seen them.

26:20.003 --> 26:21.403
They feel aggressive.

26:21.405 --> 26:25.841
They feel territorial,
and they don't want to leave,

26:25.843 --> 26:28.510
and they feel safe here.

26:28.512 --> 26:31.113
It's like, "Get out. Get out.
Get out. Get out."

26:31.115 --> 26:33.515
They don't like anybody in here.

26:33.517 --> 26:35.417
No. They don't like it.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.785
Mnh-mnh.

26:43.193 --> 26:46.094
I saw several entities
during my walk,

26:46.096 --> 26:48.730
but two of them had me
the most concerned.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.432
First, the demon.

26:50.434 --> 26:54.369
Its body is like a slug
that kind of

26:54.371 --> 26:58.473
has an upside-down
triangle head shape,

26:58.475 --> 27:01.009
and the mouth was more
like a big hole.

27:05.282 --> 27:07.048
Next, I described
the shadow person

27:07.050 --> 27:09.317
I saw attacking
a living woman.

27:09.319 --> 27:12.754
He was on top of her
in a bed,

27:12.756 --> 27:17.893
and he had his arms
on either side of her

27:17.895 --> 27:21.062
and his legs on either
side of her legs,

27:21.064 --> 27:24.166
and he's got her,
like, pegged.

27:30.274 --> 27:33.008
Is this what you saw?

27:33.010 --> 27:34.810
Yes.

27:54.598 --> 27:57.432
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:57.434 --> 27:59.901
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:59.903 --> 28:02.671
and our clients
for the first time.

28:02.673 --> 28:06.041
Now, Amy, we've done
over 125 cases together,

28:06.043 --> 28:08.176
and we've met a lot of people
going through hell,

28:08.178 --> 28:11.680
but Rebecca's case is
one of the worst.

28:11.682 --> 28:13.481
This is her mom, Linda.

28:13.483 --> 28:14.883
She lives in this house.

28:14.885 --> 28:17.619
This is her boyfriend, Mike,
who stays here on occasion.

28:17.621 --> 28:20.689
They're all experiencing things,
but they're worried

28:20.691 --> 28:23.391
that whatever is here
is trying to kill Rebecca.

28:23.393 --> 28:25.794
Now that Amy knows a little bit
about you guys,

28:25.796 --> 28:27.796
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

28:31.201 --> 28:34.469
The first thing that I need
to discuss really quickly

28:34.471 --> 28:37.405
is that I've been very sick,

28:37.407 --> 28:40.709
and when you're sick and you're
doing this kind of work,

28:40.711 --> 28:42.911
you're extremely vulnerable.

28:42.913 --> 28:47.315
I waited until I got here
to actually open,

28:47.317 --> 28:50.351
but once I did open,
one of the first things I got

28:50.353 --> 28:53.555
was a lot of negative energy
from the living here.

28:53.557 --> 28:57.459
I was hearing a lot
of different people arguing.

28:57.461 --> 29:00.562
There was definitely a male
and a female that was

29:00.564 --> 29:03.832
the top and most consistent

29:03.834 --> 29:05.700
with the arguing.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.836
Now, Rebecca, you guys
have been fighting, right?

29:07.838 --> 29:10.672
- Yeah.
- Tell Amy about that.

29:10.674 --> 29:13.341
Just fight a lot for
sometimes...

29:13.343 --> 29:16.377
seems no really good reason.

29:16.379 --> 29:17.512
Why is that?

29:17.514 --> 29:19.881
I feel like my personality
has changed.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.983
I feel very anxious
all the time.

29:21.985 --> 29:26.221
I'm...probably not a lot of fun
to be around.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.189
- Interesting.
- She gets upset.

29:28.191 --> 29:29.457
She gets depressed,
you know,

29:29.459 --> 29:31.493
just has this
negative self-image.

29:31.495 --> 29:33.027
Now, Mom, is that her?

29:33.029 --> 29:37.332
Didn't used to be her, no,
but that's how she is, now.

29:39.936 --> 29:41.736
Okay. So what else?

29:41.738 --> 29:45.707
There are two separate
entities here

29:45.709 --> 29:47.509
that are really your problem.

29:47.511 --> 29:50.044
The first one is the demon.

29:52.082 --> 29:57.418
When I first encountered it,
it was slithering like a snake.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.220
It does have arms and legs,

29:59.222 --> 30:01.956
but they're extremely
underdeveloped.

30:01.958 --> 30:05.160
Its face is extremely
triangular.

30:05.162 --> 30:07.195
Rebecca, do me a favor
and tell her

30:07.197 --> 30:09.998
what you described
to me upstairs.

30:10.000 --> 30:15.103
I saw kind of a shiny black
kind of a hovering blob,

30:15.105 --> 30:18.439
but it had tentacles
coming off of it.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.775
Now when I spoke
to your girlfriend Heidi,

30:20.777 --> 30:22.544
she talked about
a black-and-white figure

30:22.546 --> 30:25.180
with strange long ears

30:25.182 --> 30:27.081
that would follow her around
when she was kid.

30:27.083 --> 30:29.284
Interesting. Okay.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.152
Do you think what
Heidi and Rebecca saw as kids

30:31.154 --> 30:32.821
was this demon thing?

30:32.823 --> 30:35.156
I actually did have
a sketch done of it.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.629
This is interesting.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.965
This reminds me of what
your girlfriend was telling me.

30:45.836 --> 30:48.570
Ooh.

30:48.572 --> 30:52.307
It looks like what Heidi would
describe, with the long ears.

30:53.443 --> 30:56.177
This thing is in your house
now, apparently.

30:56.179 --> 30:59.881
I almost don't have words
for something like that.

30:59.883 --> 31:03.218
It's just...

31:03.220 --> 31:05.887
it's almost impossible
to comprehend.

31:09.025 --> 31:12.760
So I saw this thing in
a drainage ditch outside.

31:12.762 --> 31:17.799
It was sucking up mud and all
this crap from the ditch

31:17.801 --> 31:20.468
through its nose
and go inside,

31:20.470 --> 31:23.371
and it would vomit out
this black stuff

31:23.373 --> 31:28.076
that it had inhaled
into the person's back.

31:28.078 --> 31:30.812
What I got for living people
is that it can make them

31:30.814 --> 31:32.614
very, very ill,

31:32.616 --> 31:36.050
or it can make them
have suicidal thoughts,

31:36.052 --> 31:38.186
and the thing that
I thought maybe

31:38.188 --> 31:42.290
that it had possibly
killed somebody already.

31:44.027 --> 31:46.828
You mentioned something
about potential suicide?

31:46.830 --> 31:48.129
I came across something
in my research

31:48.131 --> 31:49.364
that might be important.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.833
In 2005, there was
a deadly car accident

31:51.835 --> 31:54.202
right up on the corner here,
just a few hundred feet away.

31:54.204 --> 31:56.604
Four teenagers were
driving in a sedan.

31:56.606 --> 31:58.840
They felt as if the driver
was being suicidal

31:58.842 --> 32:00.275
from the way he drove.

32:00.277 --> 32:03.544
The driver, Ben Moden, was
reckless and blew right through

32:03.546 --> 32:05.680
that stop sign
at the end of the road here.

32:05.682 --> 32:08.683
They were T-boned
by an oncoming pickup truck.

32:08.685 --> 32:12.153
Now, this was a huge crash,
and debris went everywhere.

32:12.155 --> 32:13.855
None of the kids
were wearing seatbelts.

32:13.857 --> 32:16.457
One of the boys
was ejected from the car.

32:16.459 --> 32:18.626
He died 3 days later
at a hospital.

32:18.628 --> 32:21.029
A 15-year-old girl
named Shawntae Taylor

32:21.031 --> 32:23.564
was killed at the scene,

32:23.566 --> 32:25.733
and the driver, Ben Moden,

32:25.735 --> 32:28.236
he wound up getting sentenced
to one year's house arrest

32:28.238 --> 32:30.138
because he was a minor
at the time.

32:30.140 --> 32:32.073
He had no drugs or alcohol
in his system,

32:32.075 --> 32:35.043
so no one knows
why he ran the stop sign.

32:35.045 --> 32:37.412
Unfortunately, we can't ask him.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.047
That's because he's dead.

32:39.049 --> 32:41.549
A year later, Ben Moden was
in another accident.

32:41.551 --> 32:44.018
He and a friend were driving
fast down the highway

32:44.020 --> 32:45.386
at 4:00 in the morning.

32:45.388 --> 32:47.588
Again, this kid Ben Moden
was driving.

32:47.590 --> 32:49.090
They weren't wearing seat belts.

32:49.092 --> 32:53.461
Ben lost control of the car
and flipped several times.

32:53.463 --> 32:55.630
Both guys were ejected
from the car.

32:55.632 --> 32:57.532
Ben was killed.

32:57.534 --> 32:59.067
I could be wrong,
but it seemed like

32:59.069 --> 33:00.735
he had a death wish, this kid.

33:00.737 --> 33:04.472
Just a sad situation.

33:04.474 --> 33:05.940
So I don't know if this
is connected or not,

33:05.942 --> 33:08.710
but you mentioned this demon
thing likes to drink water

33:08.712 --> 33:09.978
from the drainage ditch.

33:09.980 --> 33:13.214
- Is that right?
- Yes.

33:13.216 --> 33:15.750
Rebecca, you told me you
thought activity picked up

33:15.752 --> 33:18.853
after they started fracking here
a couple of years ago.

33:18.855 --> 33:20.955
Sometimes, fracking
can contaminate

33:20.957 --> 33:22.156
peoples' the drinking water.

33:22.158 --> 33:23.992
Now, I talked to
an environmental expert

33:23.994 --> 33:26.194
who says that exposure
to these chemicals

33:26.196 --> 33:28.396
could cause some of
the experiences you're having.

33:28.398 --> 33:31.199
But when I had your water
tested, it came back normal.

33:31.201 --> 33:32.400
Okay.

33:32.402 --> 33:33.901
Now you said this thing
makes people sick.

33:33.903 --> 33:37.805
Linda's husband, and Rebecca's
father, died about 6 months ago.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.774
- Yes.
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

33:39.776 --> 33:42.410
I have a couple of photos
of him here, one with Rebecca.

33:44.581 --> 33:46.347
You said it could cause
suicidal thoughts,

33:46.349 --> 33:50.418
and my dad was hospitalized at
one time for attempted suicide.

33:50.420 --> 33:51.786
Really?

33:51.788 --> 33:53.955
He struggled with depression.

33:53.957 --> 33:59.994
He would just say to me,
"I had some visitors today,

33:59.996 --> 34:03.031
"and they came to see me,

34:03.033 --> 34:05.633
but I know they weren't
really here."

34:05.635 --> 34:10.271
Could this thing have caused him
to want to commit suicide?

34:10.273 --> 34:11.572
Yes.

34:14.744 --> 34:18.478
So this demon, it was
accidentally picked up

34:18.481 --> 34:20.648
by a male who lived here.

34:20.650 --> 34:25.553
And I got that this was recent,
like in the last 50 years.

34:25.554 --> 34:27.288
Well, there's some other stuff
you should know.

34:27.290 --> 34:28.422
Mike and Rebecca have done

34:28.425 --> 34:30.190
a ton of paranormal things
in the past.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.958
You name it, they've tried it.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.295
I want you to explain to her
what's going on,

34:34.297 --> 34:35.396
what you guys did,

34:35.398 --> 34:37.532
and how the stuff spiked
after you two met.

34:37.534 --> 34:40.068
Well, it was ill-advised,
but we, you know,

34:40.070 --> 34:43.905
decided to have a couple
sessions with a Ouija board.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.306
List the other things
you've done.

34:45.308 --> 34:47.208
We've reached out
to an exorcist,

34:47.210 --> 34:48.643
a demonologist.

34:48.645 --> 34:52.480
We've worked with a, like,
a Reiki Master,

34:52.482 --> 34:54.649
and we did a ghost tour
on my birthday.

34:54.650 --> 34:55.917
Now, Linda,
I know you don't like

34:55.918 --> 34:58.486
all the...they're doing, right?
- No. I don't.

34:58.488 --> 35:02.390
I don't feel that doors
should be opened

35:02.392 --> 35:04.292
when you have a choice not to.

35:04.294 --> 35:06.494
So did Mike and Rebecca
bring this demon here?

35:06.496 --> 35:07.829
No.

35:07.831 --> 35:12.733
This could be possibly
your husband

35:12.735 --> 35:16.737
because it wasn't something
he was looking for.

35:16.739 --> 35:19.107
- It was accidentally picked up.
- Okay.

35:19.109 --> 35:21.409
So it sounds like it wasn't
Mike and Rebecca

35:21.411 --> 35:23.277
fooling around with the stuff.

35:23.279 --> 35:24.679
Not for that.

35:24.681 --> 35:27.148
Okay. For what?

35:27.150 --> 35:29.417
For something else.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.718
So you're not off the hook.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.453
No, you're not.

35:32.455 --> 35:34.789
The biggest threat
in the house

35:34.791 --> 35:38.893
to <i> you,</i> specifically,
is the shadow man.

35:40.296 --> 35:43.931
So what I saw was a male
with a Ouija board,

35:43.933 --> 35:47.535
and that is what caused
the shadow person

35:47.537 --> 35:49.804
to come into this realm.

35:49.806 --> 35:53.407
And I saw it fixated on a female
in the room upstairs,

35:53.409 --> 35:54.609
to the left.

35:54.611 --> 35:56.811
That's Rebecca's room.

35:56.813 --> 36:00.448
Some of the specific things
that I saw it doing to you

36:00.450 --> 36:03.151
was dragging you off the bed,

36:03.153 --> 36:06.621
that there would be bruises that
you would maybe wake up with

36:06.623 --> 36:09.957
because it's trying to pick you
up and drag you through walls,

36:09.959 --> 36:12.793
and that it's happening
pretty much every night.

36:12.795 --> 36:14.028
You remember when I said

36:14.030 --> 36:16.264
Rebecca was going through hell
here, right?

36:16.266 --> 36:17.932
You pretty much hit on why.

36:17.934 --> 36:20.902
I get scratches and bruises.

36:20.904 --> 36:23.271
Look at this.
Look at these bruises.

36:23.273 --> 36:25.706
Wow.

36:25.708 --> 36:27.942
Feel like I've been
held down in my bed.

36:27.944 --> 36:30.711
I had my tooth knocked out.

36:30.713 --> 36:32.847
I was laying in bed
and I went to sit up,

36:32.849 --> 36:36.751
and as I was sitting up, I felt,
like, a punch in my face.

36:36.753 --> 36:38.986
All right. Now this
is the weird part, though.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.321
This stuff doesn't
just happen here.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.424
When you go to Mike's house,
it's happened.

36:43.426 --> 36:45.960
And she just got, basically,
thrown off her feet

36:45.962 --> 36:48.262
and into my closet door.

36:48.264 --> 36:50.431
There might be some
jealousy stuff here

36:50.433 --> 36:53.201
because you're dealing
with a shadow person

36:53.203 --> 36:56.504
who believes that
she's a shadow person.

36:56.506 --> 37:01.008
That's why it's so mean
and so aggressive with you.

37:01.010 --> 37:04.579
It wants you
to go home with it.

37:04.581 --> 37:06.280
I know you weren't intending
to do something like that.

37:06.282 --> 37:08.049
I mean, are you feeling
guilty about it?

37:08.051 --> 37:10.885
Yeah. I kind of am, and it
really wasn't even my idea

37:10.887 --> 37:13.487
to do the Ouija board.

37:13.489 --> 37:15.122
So you're blaming Rebecca
for this?

37:15.124 --> 37:18.492
She started seeing
this black shadow

37:18.494 --> 37:20.027
before the Ouija board.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.597
- You buying that?
- All I know is what I see,

37:22.599 --> 37:25.633
and what I saw was a man
with a Ouija board,

37:25.635 --> 37:27.635
and then this thing
was there.

37:27.637 --> 37:29.170
You're busted, cuz.
Forget about it.

37:31.941 --> 37:33.708
Another thing I saw
this shadow person

37:33.710 --> 37:36.577
doing to you
was really horrifying,

37:36.579 --> 37:39.380
and I actually did have
a sketch done of it.

37:47.757 --> 37:49.924
Gee whiz.

37:49.926 --> 37:51.626
That's why I don't sleep
at night.

37:55.932 --> 37:58.566
I didn't want to bring it up,
but there was some other issues

37:58.568 --> 38:01.569
you had in the bedroom
with this thing.

38:01.571 --> 38:05.039
I felt like one
night, I was sexually assaulted,

38:05.041 --> 38:07.808
but there was nothing there.

38:07.810 --> 38:11.245
I just can't imagine
what she's going through.

38:11.247 --> 38:13.247
We just have to fix it.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.349
What the hell does this thing
want with Rebecca?

38:15.351 --> 38:17.952
Well, it wants
to take her home.

38:17.954 --> 38:21.088
So if, god forbid, this was to
happen, where would she wind up?

38:21.090 --> 38:23.758
She would be missing.

38:23.760 --> 38:27.528
He could accidentally
kill you

38:27.530 --> 38:31.465
trying to get you
to his reality.

38:50.295 --> 38:52.262
Now, Rebecca, when we spoke
the other day,

38:52.264 --> 38:54.197
I knew this was going to be
a rough night for you,

38:54.199 --> 38:56.166
but I had no idea it was
going to be this bad.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.934
Now, I don't know what Amy
is going to say,

38:57.936 --> 38:59.302
but I hope she has
a solution for you,

38:59.304 --> 39:01.604
because nobody deserves
to go through the abuse

39:01.606 --> 39:03.206
you're going through.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.275
With that, I'll turn it over
to Amy and see what she's got.

39:08.246 --> 39:11.314
It's a very unique situation

39:11.316 --> 39:14.317
because real shadow people
are negative

39:14.319 --> 39:18.755
and nearly impossible
to get rid of.

39:18.757 --> 39:23.460
So you are, unfortunately,
in an abusive relationship

39:23.462 --> 39:25.562
that you can't get out of.

39:25.564 --> 39:29.599
So you are going to have
to implement

39:29.601 --> 39:33.870
different protection measures
to try to survive.

39:33.872 --> 39:37.173
Something will work for a month,
and then it'll stop,

39:37.175 --> 39:41.411
and then you're going to have to
employ a different measure.

39:41.413 --> 39:42.979
What are we looking for?

39:42.981 --> 39:44.647
Because I want
to help with this.

39:44.649 --> 39:48.184
I can give you a bag of stuff
that you can use.

39:48.186 --> 39:50.787
You know, putting black salt
around your bed at night.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.188
Maybe it'll work
for a few nights,

39:52.190 --> 39:55.125
and then you go to, say,

39:55.127 --> 39:58.595
putting brimstone or sulfur
at your door,

39:58.597 --> 40:03.633
but it's always going to be
something that's temporary.

40:03.635 --> 40:06.102
What you can hope is that
one day,

40:06.104 --> 40:09.405
he's gonna figure it out
and he's going to figure out

40:09.407 --> 40:12.509
how to get himself back
to his realm.

40:12.511 --> 40:13.877
I can't get rid of him.

40:13.879 --> 40:16.613
I don't want to live the rest
of my life with him.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.982
I tell you,
this is a heartbreaking case.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.750
I really don't have words
for it.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.353
I was just so hoping
that we could deal

40:23.355 --> 40:25.255
with the shadow person.

40:25.257 --> 40:28.458
Unfortunately, it's like you're
going to be experimenting.

40:28.460 --> 40:31.828
That's all you can do
with shadow people.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.997
What about this guy?

40:33.999 --> 40:36.432
Now that guy, you can do
something about.

40:36.434 --> 40:40.203
Find a local tribe and a local
person from that tribe

40:40.205 --> 40:43.773
who is either a practicing
medicine person or a shaman.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.542
That person can come here

40:45.544 --> 40:49.379
and can protect
your entire property line.

40:49.381 --> 40:50.780
Are you going to do that?

40:50.782 --> 40:52.315
Yeah.

40:52.317 --> 40:55.118
That's probably fairly easy
for us to...

40:55.120 --> 40:58.488
...get a hold of them.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.924
I think it would be
a huge first step

41:00.926 --> 41:05.195
because I think it might
allow her to be healthier.

41:05.197 --> 41:07.764
And building
her confidence level.

41:07.766 --> 41:10.033
I mean, how do you feel about
knowing everything now?

41:10.035 --> 41:12.101
It's pretty hard
to put into words.

41:12.103 --> 41:17.073
I was so hopeful that
we really...

41:17.075 --> 41:18.641
would get something
more positive

41:18.643 --> 41:22.312
to resolve it,
but we'll resolve it.

41:22.314 --> 41:24.147
It'll just take work.

41:24.149 --> 41:26.683
You know what you're dealing
with now, I think.

41:28.854 --> 41:31.721
I know what to do now.

41:31.723 --> 41:33.990
I really hope Rebecca
contacts a shaman

41:33.992 --> 41:37.594
to banish the demon that's
been terrorizing her family.

41:37.596 --> 41:40.396
Once he's gone, she can focus
on protecting herself

41:40.398 --> 41:43.032
from the shadow person
tormenting her.

41:43.034 --> 41:45.268
And hopefully, one day,
it will leave on its own,

41:45.270 --> 41:47.136
giving Rebecca some peace.
