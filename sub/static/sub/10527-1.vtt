to becoming the super-cop
of your most cherished dream.

02:22.442 --> 02:23.602
Larry here.

02:23.676 --> 02:25.610
Bo here. I'm at Elmer's.

02:25.678 --> 02:28.442
Better get down here.
We got us a situation.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.608
All right, Sheriff, I'm on my way.

02:33.019 --> 02:34.008
What's up, Boodles?

02:46.332 --> 02:48.630
Let's go do some good.

03:05.485 --> 03:07.385
What's going on?

03:07.453 --> 03:10.354
Uh, Elmer's in the barn.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.050
He's armed, and he's got a hostage,

03:12.125 --> 03:14.093
somebody named Buttercup.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.324
We figure it's either his girlfriend
or his horse.

03:18.398 --> 03:20.923
With Elmer, it's the same thing.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.669
Hold that.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.203
Oh, you.

03:26.472 --> 03:29.964
Elmer! It's Larry!

03:30.043 --> 03:31.101
Don't shoot.

03:31.177 --> 03:32.371
I'm coming in!

03:37.050 --> 03:38.984
Where you at, bud?

03:40.687 --> 03:42.951
Right here.

03:44.591 --> 03:45.683
Tell me your troubles.

03:45.758 --> 03:47.783
It's over, Larry.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.624
That damn mare's thrown me
for the last time.

03:50.697 --> 03:53.427
I'm gonna put her down.

03:57.203 --> 03:58.363
Stay here.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.372
Put down that damn gun.

04:01.374 --> 04:03.569
Hey, sugar.

04:03.643 --> 04:06.339
Hey. Need a buttercup
for Buttercup. Huh?

04:06.412 --> 04:08.312
Buttercup for Buttercup?

04:08.381 --> 04:09.905
These is delicious.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.541
There you go.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.108
See what we got here.

04:17.357 --> 04:18.688
What the...

04:18.757 --> 04:20.452
Oh, for Pete's sake.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.084
You big retard!

04:22.161 --> 04:23.924
Hey, Elmer!

04:23.997 --> 04:25.965
Next time, clean the burrs
off the saddle

04:26.032 --> 04:27.499
before you put it on her.

04:27.567 --> 04:28.898
Sorry, Larry.

04:28.968 --> 04:30.595
Don't tell me, tell her.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.900
Well, I ain't going to apologize
to no dumb animal.

04:32.972 --> 04:34.872
You know, that's probably
why you're getting thrown.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.704
You don't know how to treat a lady.

04:36.776 --> 04:37.834
Here.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.971
Go on, give it to her.

04:43.049 --> 04:44.641
Good girl.

04:44.717 --> 04:47.151
I'm sorry.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.619
That's a girl.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.989
Ah, jeez.

05:05.505 --> 05:07.905
Smoot just saved the free world, Larry.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.236
Where the hell were you?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.708
Staking out the Krispy Kreme.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.940
Putting up his profile
on IntimateCousins. com.

05:14.013 --> 05:15.947
Laugh it up, you sorry
sons of bitches.

05:16.015 --> 05:18.279
I closed that deal.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.613
I made you a malt, Larry.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.586
Drown your sorrows.

05:21.654 --> 05:25.681
What sorrows? I saved Buttercup
and kept Elmer out of jail.

05:25.758 --> 05:27.919
Then it's a celebration!

05:27.994 --> 05:30.827
Ah. Boy, Connie,
you know what your malts do to me?

05:30.897 --> 05:32.421
Countin' on it, darlin'

05:32.498 --> 05:33.658
I get off in an hour.

05:33.733 --> 05:34.893
Ain't gonna take that long.

05:34.967 --> 05:36.628
I got Crisco at my house.

05:38.638 --> 05:41.471
Hey, I thought that lure
is supposed to catch the big fish.

05:41.541 --> 05:42.803
You playing a minnow,
there, Connie.

05:42.875 --> 05:46.333
Gus, if Larry's a minnow,
you must be a shrimp.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.505
Boy, big-titted and quick-witted.

05:50.583 --> 05:51.948
That's how I like 'em.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.178
She's the onliest reason

05:53.252 --> 05:54.480
I stay around this two-mule town.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.317
I thought it was for the free rent.

05:56.389 --> 05:57.321
Or the fishing.

05:57.390 --> 06:02.418
The unbreakable bond of friendship
that dates back to our formative years.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.199
Yeah, I do dream of bigger things.

06:07.266 --> 06:08.961
Although, Connie's ain't small.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.559
I mean, big enough
for most fellers, but...

06:10.636 --> 06:12.035
Nope, what this town lacks

06:12.105 --> 06:15.541
is law enforcement opportunities
that equal my cap-a-cicity.

06:15.608 --> 06:19.203
You ain't gonna find a town
with less crime than this one.

06:19.278 --> 06:21.246
Smoot wants to shuffle off
to the raisin ranch.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.248
How does Sheriff Larry sound?

06:24.350 --> 06:25.374
Hey, better yet,

06:25.451 --> 06:28.443
how does Special Agent Larry sound?

06:28.521 --> 06:30.250
Federal Bureau of...

06:30.323 --> 06:32.450
Guys who show their butt cracks!

06:32.525 --> 06:34.789
FBI, Gus.

06:34.861 --> 06:37.557
That's right,
I'm ready for the big-time.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.825
'Cause I know a criminal
when I see one,

06:39.899 --> 06:41.992
a rat when I smell one,

06:42.068 --> 06:44.059
and a bad moon when it rises.

06:58.684 --> 07:00.743
Bring her in.

07:22.108 --> 07:26.545
Tell me she ain't hotter
than an electric prod on a hog's ass.

07:29.215 --> 07:31.080
Did you see them fellers?

07:31.150 --> 07:32.777
Them bulges?

07:32.852 --> 07:35.480
They either got elephant mumps
or they're packin' heat.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.490
Oh, you've been watching
way too many cop shows.

07:38.558 --> 07:41.083
They try to go in there with me,
I'm going to scream.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.128
Did she just say something
about screaming?

07:43.196 --> 07:44.663
You think she's in trouble, huh?

07:44.730 --> 07:45.992
Yeah, I do.

07:46.065 --> 07:47.362
Oh, happy prunes!

07:47.433 --> 07:49.993
Especially since Dotter and Marge
just dropped a deuce in there!

07:52.405 --> 07:54.805
Four coffees to go, honey.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.035
Black, honey?

08:06.986 --> 08:09.284
There's a black
Suburban out there.

08:09.355 --> 08:11.414
You know who drives
black Suburbans?

08:11.491 --> 08:12.958
Drug dealers,

08:13.025 --> 08:14.322
smugglers,

08:14.393 --> 08:16.759
I'm telling you.

08:22.368 --> 08:24.063
Keep your hands off me.

08:24.136 --> 08:25.194
See, look.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.603
Calm down. Don't make a scene.

08:31.377 --> 08:32.969
What'd I tell you?

08:33.044 --> 08:34.808
Did you see that rude jerk?

08:34.881 --> 08:35.813
Yes, I did.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.371
Not only is he a rude jerk,

08:37.450 --> 08:39.077
I think he's a kidnapper.

08:39.150 --> 08:40.778
Have you lost your marbles?

08:40.852 --> 08:43.378
Come on, men in black,
high-class babe.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.720
Babe? You think she's a babe?

08:45.791 --> 08:47.520
She looked like
a different B-word to me.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.993
"Furtervious," sneaky attitude,

08:50.062 --> 08:51.654
security procedurals...

08:53.366 --> 08:55.891
If this ain't a kidnapping,
I ain't a lawman.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.435
Now that you mention it...

09:00.339 --> 09:01.704
What are you gonna do?

09:01.774 --> 09:03.935
I'm gonna rescue me
a damsel in deestress.

09:04.010 --> 09:07.946
If you're gonna rescue a damsel,
I get off in 48 minutes.

09:08.014 --> 09:11.916
Connie, this could
be my chance at the big time here.

09:11.984 --> 09:15.442
You're blowing your chance
for a big time with me.

09:15.521 --> 09:17.682
Sweetheart, you're
gonna be proud of me.

09:17.757 --> 09:20.817
I don't want to be proud.
I want to get some.

09:22.762 --> 09:25.925
Some help cleaning my garage.

09:25.998 --> 09:28.899
Well, I guess big time can wait
a minute and 37 seconds.

09:28.968 --> 09:30.196
Forget it.

09:30.269 --> 09:32.203
You'd rather chase that other woman.

09:32.271 --> 09:35.536
I wouldn't touch you now
if you put on your Billy Ray Cyrus wig.

09:38.644 --> 09:39.668
She's kidding.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.838
I ain't got no such like wig.

09:44.450 --> 09:46.042
Con, come on, I really
need to do this.

09:46.118 --> 09:47.642
Well, what if you're wrong?

09:47.720 --> 09:50.883
Like the time I shot
that masked gunman

09:50.957 --> 09:52.049
at Coleman's jewelry store

09:52.124 --> 09:53.682
and it turned out
to be Old Man Coleman?

09:53.759 --> 09:56.922
Yes, on Halloween.

09:56.996 --> 10:01.433
Or that time I thought I cracked
that major illegal immigrant ring,

10:01.500 --> 10:03.866
and it turned out to be the Sanchez
family reunion?

10:03.936 --> 10:07.167
Yeah, Mayor Sanchez
was pretty upset about that.

10:07.239 --> 10:10.766
All right, so I made
some minor mistakes,

10:10.843 --> 10:14.574
but you can't make an omelet
without cracking a few walnuts.

10:14.647 --> 10:17.138
Con, this is gonna be different.

10:17.216 --> 10:21.653
Next time you see me,
that badge is gonna say FBI.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.279
You'll see.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.693
I don't love your job, Larry.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.357
I love you.

10:37.937 --> 10:40.804
Then trust me,
I'm doing the right thing,

10:40.873 --> 10:43.239
Larry, please.

10:43.309 --> 10:48.770
Darlin', a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.476
I know. I just don't
want my man to get hurt.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.446
Then your love will be
my bulletproof vest.

10:55.521 --> 10:57.318
Oh, Larry.

11:07.066 --> 11:08.090
Women.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.965
Who can possibly unravulate
their mysteries?

11:12.104 --> 11:14.095
Then again, who gives a shit?

11:14.173 --> 11:16.607
I'm just kidding.
I didn't mean that, Con.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.977
Norm's Last Chance. This is Norm.

11:55.181 --> 11:58.878
Oh, toothless son of a godless whore!

11:58.951 --> 12:00.714
I got teeth.

12:00.786 --> 12:04.153
And for the last time,
Mama was a dancer.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.986
You got my money, cuz? A bet's a bet.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.286
You gotta be kidding me.

12:07.359 --> 12:10.192
That girl had more scars on her chest
than Frankenstein.

12:10.262 --> 12:11.923
That's because she
was mauled by a bear.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.931
But her boobs were real.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.626
All right, I'll pay you. Shit.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.293
But listen, at presently,

12:17.369 --> 12:20.202
I'm involved in a high-level
law enforcement pursuit

12:20.272 --> 12:23.173
and have reason to believe
that the subject in question

12:23.242 --> 12:26.075
may attempt to regress
at your peril, man.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.635
Speak American, Larry.

12:27.713 --> 12:29.874
Got bad dudes
headed your way, Norm.

12:29.949 --> 12:35.751
No, I am quite sure
that no men-in-black kidnappers

12:35.821 --> 12:38.984
driving Suburbans
with beautiful hostages

12:39.058 --> 12:40.787
has been by here today.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.965
Well, burn the tick off my butt.

12:49.034 --> 12:50.831
Hold 'em there, keep 'em there.
I'm on the way.

12:50.903 --> 12:51.801
With my money?

12:53.005 --> 12:55.269
We must be going through
a bad cell area, Norm.

12:55.341 --> 12:56.638
I'll see you in a minute.

13:29.275 --> 13:31.072
The oil's fine.

13:31.143 --> 13:34.010
Hell, I'm sure it is,
but I have to check it.

13:34.079 --> 13:35.103
It's part of the full service.

13:35.181 --> 13:36.443
Consider it checked.

13:36.515 --> 13:39.348
Well, I can't do that.
It's company policy.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.942
All right, all right. just make it snappy.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.532
The oil is fine, isn't it?

13:55.601 --> 13:58.035
Yes, sir. Yes, it is.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.098
What's that?

14:03.943 --> 14:06.639
Oh, it's gas. It's gas.

14:06.712 --> 14:07.804
You got a fuel leak.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.580
Here, it's split.

14:10.649 --> 14:13.516
See, GM gets these
chintzy hoses from Red China,

14:13.586 --> 14:14.644
and they're not worth turd pie.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.449
Shut up. Just fix it.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.616
Yes, sir. Yes.

14:25.397 --> 14:29.094
How much longer
is this going to take?

14:29.168 --> 14:33.468
Well, I don't have
this exact hose in stock,

14:33.539 --> 14:36.906
so I'm gonna have to improvise.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.442
There's no smoking in here, ma'am.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.832
How nice. A gentleman.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.834
That's me.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.273
"Swayve" and "deboner."

15:10.342 --> 15:11.934
Listen, I'm here to help you.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.000
Help me what?

15:13.078 --> 15:14.375
Escape.

15:14.446 --> 15:15.435
From the clutches of evil.

15:15.514 --> 15:17.414
How, by impeaching Bush?

15:17.483 --> 15:19.781
Listen, just act natural
and get in my truck over there.

15:19.852 --> 15:23.515
I'd rather get in a hearse
for my own funeral.

15:27.359 --> 15:28.656
You need to speed it up.

15:28.727 --> 15:30.217
I'm trying to execute
a flawless ejaculation.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.025
I beg your pardon!

15:33.232 --> 15:35.291
- Hey!
- Oh, shit. We've been nailed.

15:35.367 --> 15:36.391
Get away from me, you pervert.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.436
- Hold it!
- Blue 47! Break!

15:38.504 --> 15:40.267
- Put me down!
- Hold my head!

15:40.339 --> 15:41.738
Start the car.

15:41.807 --> 15:46.642
Aah! No! Put me down,
you crazy grizzly bear.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.379
Get in the car!

15:50.449 --> 15:52.883
Ah! No!

15:54.186 --> 15:55.312
Boy, those are real.

16:08.701 --> 16:12.501
I didn't get the clip on!

16:20.813 --> 16:22.246
Are you insane?

16:22.314 --> 16:23.508
No, I'm Larry.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.752
You haven't the slightest idea
of what you're doing.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.155
Sweet potato, I know
exactly what I'm doing.

16:34.626 --> 16:35.923
Brilliant.

16:43.569 --> 16:44.831
Mobsters or terrorists?

16:44.903 --> 16:46.962
I don't know. Are you
a mobster or a terrorist?

16:47.039 --> 16:48.700
Not me, them.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.038
They're FBI agents, you cretin.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.008
I ain't cree.

16:52.077 --> 16:53.669
So why'd the FBI kidnap you?

16:53.746 --> 16:56.374
They didn't kidnap me.
They were protecting me.

16:56.448 --> 16:57.881
You're kidnapping me.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.282
- Brainwashed you, huh?
- What?

17:00.352 --> 17:01.444
They do the Patty Hearst on ya?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.215
A little stockyard syndrome?

17:03.288 --> 17:04.915
Frickin' evil bastards.

17:08.727 --> 17:09.715
Hey.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.598
If I want you to play with my shifter,
I'll let you know.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.141
Well, are you at least
going to excuse yourself?

17:27.212 --> 17:28.542
Liberal, huh?

17:28.614 --> 17:29.546
What?

17:29.615 --> 17:30.741
That's what liberals do.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.477
Always trying to
accuse everybody else

17:32.551 --> 17:33.984
of doing the same thing they're doing.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.749
Are you trying to imply
that you didn't just break wind?

17:36.822 --> 17:39.723
That little squeak?
That was all you, sugar.

17:39.792 --> 17:43.592
Believe me, if I let one fly,
they'll pick that up on the Doppler.

17:45.864 --> 17:49.163
Well, at least roll down my window.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.293
Oh, for the love of Mike.

17:53.305 --> 17:55.705
Looks like you've
inflicted collateral damage

17:55.774 --> 17:57.765
upon my finest mallard caller.

17:57.843 --> 18:00.368
I want you to stop this truck
and let me out immediately.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.539
- Aah!
- What the...

18:04.049 --> 18:05.346
Stop this truck!

18:05.417 --> 18:07.578
Sweet potato, I got a policy.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.052
If somebody's shooting at me, I run.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.520
Watch this.

18:19.231 --> 18:20.596
Floor it!

18:23.235 --> 18:24.634
What's happening?

18:27.306 --> 18:29.297
It's the hose, sir.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.171
He didn't get the clip attached.

18:31.243 --> 18:33.507
He didn't get the clip attached.

18:36.482 --> 18:39.212
Are we slowing down?

18:39.284 --> 18:41.309
Are they getting away?

18:44.456 --> 18:47.391
Does a compass point north?

18:49.228 --> 18:50.559
It does, sir.

18:56.735 --> 18:58.168
That a girl.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.364
Boy, I love this truck.

19:00.439 --> 19:04.000
What is that god-awful racket?

19:06.044 --> 19:09.207
You need to download
a decent ringtone.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.943
- Hello.
- What the hell is going on?

19:12.017 --> 19:13.245
That's what I'd like to know.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.684
Toby Keith's a good one.
Charlie Daniels.

19:15.754 --> 19:16.686
Are you all right?

19:16.755 --> 19:19.553
As if you care. You were shooting at me.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.525
Waylon. Willie's always good.

19:21.593 --> 19:22.958
Not at you, at the psycho.

19:23.028 --> 19:24.495
You were never in any danger.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.428
Oh, what a relief.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.056
I was never in any danger.

19:28.133 --> 19:29.566
He was shooting at the psycho.

19:29.635 --> 19:32.365
Them son of a bitches almost
made a mistake and got me.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.667
Give me that phone.

19:34.740 --> 19:38.938
This is Deputy Larry Stalder
of the Amicus County Sheriff's Department.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.740
Identify yourself.

19:40.812 --> 19:43.610
Special Agent Ricardo Bodi, FBI,

19:43.682 --> 19:45.206
Witness Protection Program.

19:45.284 --> 19:49.220
I thought the FBI was supposed to
rescue hostages, not take 'em.

19:49.288 --> 19:52.416
You seem to be laboring under some
misconception, Deputy.

19:52.491 --> 19:55.358
We were in the process of escorting
a valuable witness

19:55.427 --> 19:56.359
when you intervened.

19:56.428 --> 19:58.419
Boy, I love that government lingo.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.226
What's that mean?

20:01.767 --> 20:04.565
I'm impressed, Deputy.

20:04.636 --> 20:07.571
You're a smooth talker.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.539
Your truck has deceptive speed.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.235
Yeah, it's pretty fast, too.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.902
Now, I want my witness back.

20:12.978 --> 20:14.445
Let me ask you something,

20:14.513 --> 20:16.538
how long you been
with the Bureau?

20:16.615 --> 20:18.515
19 wonderful years,

20:18.584 --> 20:21.348
during which, mostly said,
I have compiled

20:21.420 --> 20:24.389
a unblemished record
of impeccable service,

20:24.456 --> 20:25.821
which I'd like to keep intact.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.688
19 years?

20:27.759 --> 20:29.818
Shoot, you oughta be SAC by now.

20:29.895 --> 20:30.919
Indeed, I am.

20:30.996 --> 20:33.726
Scratch my nuts and call me shorty,

20:33.799 --> 20:36.597
I'm talking to a special agent in charge.

20:36.668 --> 20:40.001
You know, that was
always one of my not so secret dreams

20:40.072 --> 20:43.007
to wanna be a G-man myself.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.838
You don't say.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.969
I do say, and in spades.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.972
Nothing racialistic intended.

20:50.048 --> 20:52.846
You think you could
write me a letter of recommendation?

20:52.918 --> 20:55.580
It'd be my pleasure.
Now what about my witness?

20:56.922 --> 21:00.790
Heck, if that's all that's holding us up,
let's go to the swap meet.

21:00.859 --> 21:02.486
I'll call you back.

21:02.561 --> 21:04.256
Standin' by!

21:06.031 --> 21:09.432
Get your little book out.

21:09.501 --> 21:11.696
Write down the name Larry.

21:14.439 --> 21:15.804
Now draw a line through it.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.678
I didn't think it was possible.

21:20.746 --> 21:21.678
What's that?

21:21.747 --> 21:23.476
For you to be dumber than you look.

21:23.548 --> 21:25.448
Guess again, Longshanks.

21:25.517 --> 21:27.917
You know, I didn't think it was possible

21:27.986 --> 21:30.784
for somebody's ass to be
tighter than a bull's during fly season.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.222
You don't even know
where you're going.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.953
I know exactly where I'm going.

21:35.027 --> 21:38.155
Shoot, I know these
back roads like I do

21:38.230 --> 21:41.893
the ingrown hair pimples
on my ex-girlfriend's front bud.

21:50.842 --> 21:51.866
I see.

22:05.557 --> 22:08.890
You wanna step
out of the car, please, ma'am?

22:20.605 --> 22:22.266
Just don't ask me to get back in.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.805
Beautiful, isn't it?

22:25.877 --> 22:28.971
If you like insects,
animal excrement, and dysentery.

22:29.047 --> 22:31.481
Look, we ain't been
formally introduced.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.450
My name's Larry.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.316
I know, although
I profoundly wish I did not.

22:36.388 --> 22:37.320
And who are you?

22:37.389 --> 22:38.822
I'm Madeleine Dimkowski.

22:38.890 --> 22:42.223
Pleasure to meet your acquaintance,
Madeleine.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.922
Just have a couple of
questions I need to ask you.

22:44.996 --> 22:46.623
Such as...

22:46.698 --> 22:49.667
just what is the FBI
protecting you from?

22:49.735 --> 22:51.066
None of your business.

22:51.136 --> 22:52.125
So you won't talk.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.330
Not a chance.

22:53.405 --> 22:54.804
Is that your final answer?

22:56.174 --> 22:58.506
Hey, you heard her, Skinny.
She don't wanna talk.

23:00.812 --> 23:02.609
What's that?

23:02.681 --> 23:06.276
No, we can't force her.

23:06.351 --> 23:07.443
Shoot, this ain't Abu Grub.

23:07.519 --> 23:08.611
Okay, I'll talk. I'll talk.

23:08.687 --> 23:11.622
Just... Just... Just...
Just get that thing...

23:14.326 --> 23:16.920
I was a senior accountant
at GiantCom.

23:16.995 --> 23:18.121
I worked for Arthur Grimsley.

23:18.196 --> 23:20.061
I know that case...

23:20.132 --> 23:22.623
I know that case.
I seen it on Court TV.

23:22.701 --> 23:24.601
Operation Looker Cooker.

23:24.669 --> 23:26.933
Yeah, that Grimsley was
skimming six ways from Sunday,

23:27.005 --> 23:29.633
had that good-looking babe cooking the books
and cuffing his pork.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.573
Hey, why'd you beef?

23:31.643 --> 23:33.907
You lost me in the meat section.

23:33.979 --> 23:36.504
Grimsley dumped you.

23:36.581 --> 23:39.607
He most certainly did not dump me.

23:39.684 --> 23:42.209
I was just fed up with the venality
and the chicanery.

23:42.287 --> 23:44.187
Well, that vecanery,
that chaps my ass, too.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.884
But his goons will try
to keep me from testifying.

23:46.958 --> 23:49.722
The FBI was escorting me
to the trial in Chicago

23:49.795 --> 23:52.389
until you decided
to play the Lone Ranger.

23:52.464 --> 23:54.329
Clint Eastwood.
I was playing Clint Eastwood.

23:54.399 --> 23:55.331
Whomever.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.332
Lone Ranger.

23:56.401 --> 23:59.165
Them little powder blue duds? Shoot.

23:59.237 --> 24:00.898
Them things would ride up my crack.

24:04.242 --> 24:05.436
I'll answer it.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.876
First get rid of that thing.

24:07.946 --> 24:11.074
Shoot. Skinny?
He's just a little old rat snake.

24:11.149 --> 24:12.377
He ain't gonna hurt nobody.

24:23.161 --> 24:24.719
Let me see that phone.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.359
Yeah?

24:27.432 --> 24:29.457
You know Tutweilers
Pig Farm off route 45?

24:29.534 --> 24:30.728
I do.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.292
Follow the smell. I'll meet you there.

24:32.370 --> 24:34.338
I'll be there.

24:34.406 --> 24:39.469
Heh. Now we'll see who's
stupid, Miss I.P. Perfume.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.518
It stinks out here.

24:47.586 --> 24:50.680
Is it also humid?
Are we on planet Earth?

24:58.897 --> 25:00.194
Hello, Larry.

25:01.566 --> 25:03.431
You got my letter?

25:03.502 --> 25:04.969
Right here.

25:05.036 --> 25:06.594
Well, now.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.104
What about my witness?

25:08.173 --> 25:09.401
She's fine.

25:37.903 --> 25:39.837
Say, where's your backup at?

25:39.905 --> 25:41.133
What backup?

25:41.206 --> 25:43.538
Section 17. It's in the manual.

25:43.608 --> 25:47.544
Proper procedural
for a hostage transfer.

25:47.612 --> 25:50.979
We don't always go by the book, Larry.

26:20.445 --> 26:22.675
Go on! Get on out, everybody!

26:22.747 --> 26:23.975
Now!

26:34.159 --> 26:36.957
Enough. Enough.

26:37.028 --> 26:40.054
This is silly. Get in the car.

26:41.566 --> 26:43.534
Slide over. What you trying to do,
get me killed?

26:48.506 --> 26:50.440
Jesus.

26:56.381 --> 26:58.975
Just... go.

27:06.491 --> 27:08.857
God damn.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.361
You crazy son of a bitch!

27:17.435 --> 27:18.561
What'd you do back there?

27:18.637 --> 27:19.797
Found out Bodi's dirty.

27:19.871 --> 27:21.304
Dirtier than Larry Flynt's diary.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.364
- That's idiotic!
- He ain't followin' procedure.

27:23.441 --> 27:25.272
Oh, as if you would know.

27:25.343 --> 27:29.336
1, he opened fire
in dangerous close proximification

27:29.414 --> 27:30.438
to a protected witness.

27:30.515 --> 27:32.073
That's a violation.

27:32.150 --> 27:36.280
2, he agreed
to my proposed location

27:36.354 --> 27:38.015
for a little teet-a-teet,

27:38.089 --> 27:39.613
and didn't have
the escape routes covered.

27:39.691 --> 27:41.556
That's a violation.

27:41.626 --> 27:45.323
And 3, he didn't call for backup.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.329
- That's a setup.
- Is that all?

27:46.398 --> 27:47.365
Ain't that enough?

27:47.432 --> 27:49.923
You held up four fingers, Larry.

27:50.001 --> 27:53.232
Oh, yeah.
My letter of recommendation.

27:56.641 --> 27:59.439
Oh. He could just be indignant.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.342
On a government salary
with benefits?

28:01.413 --> 28:02.471
You kidding me?

28:02.547 --> 28:04.742
Indignant, as in offended.

28:04.816 --> 28:06.283
Not indigent, as in penniless.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.546
Oh, forgot it.
Why do I bother with a man

28:08.620 --> 28:11.088
who keeps a possum
in his glove compartment?

28:11.156 --> 28:13.386
Wally's in the glove box?
Wally! Wally!

28:13.458 --> 28:15.483
Don't!

28:15.560 --> 28:17.858
What are you gonna do with me?

28:17.929 --> 28:20.591
Pretty soon we'll be
in Chicago, there, Slim Jim,

28:20.665 --> 28:23.498
and when I turn you over
to the United States Attorney,

28:23.568 --> 28:25.536
I think you'll be singing
a different tune.

28:26.604 --> 28:28.765
Quite possibly
"Achy Breaky Heart".

29:06.511 --> 29:08.445
We only give free refills
to nice customers,

29:08.513 --> 29:10.174
and y'all weren't that nice.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.442
We're looking for Larry.

29:11.516 --> 29:14.110
He ain't in my bra.

29:14.185 --> 29:15.948
Yes, ma'am.

29:17.989 --> 29:19.923
Who are you guys?

29:19.991 --> 29:21.219
You look like that movie.

29:21.292 --> 29:23.453
Is Larry an alien?

29:23.528 --> 29:25.928
'Cause that would
explain a lot of things.

29:25.997 --> 29:26.929
Nice beaver.

29:26.998 --> 29:27.930
Crabs.

29:27.999 --> 29:30.263
No, I mean...

29:30.335 --> 29:32.826
He was attacked by land crabs.

29:32.904 --> 29:35.134
Cut him up pretty bad
with their claws.

29:35.206 --> 29:36.969
If, uh, Larry
wanted to get away

29:37.041 --> 29:40.010
because he was in trouble,
where would he hide out?

29:40.078 --> 29:41.670
His cousin's, probably.

29:41.746 --> 29:43.509
- Who's that?
- He's got about 60,

29:43.581 --> 29:45.378
spread across five states.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.974
Hey, where's the chick
with all the jewels?

29:47.051 --> 29:49.542
He has her. He has her
or he's had her?

29:49.621 --> 29:51.782
He has her! I don't know
if he's had her.

29:51.856 --> 29:53.323
'Cause if he's had her, he's had it!

29:53.391 --> 29:54.517
No, I've had it!

29:54.592 --> 29:55.854
This is a top priority case.

29:55.927 --> 29:57.519
I don't have time
to play games with you.

29:57.595 --> 30:00.325
Where's your warrant
to bust in here?

30:00.398 --> 30:02.366
I can tell you in two words:

30:02.433 --> 30:03.923
national security.

30:04.002 --> 30:05.629
I can tell you back in two words:

30:05.703 --> 30:07.796
bull... shit.

30:11.242 --> 30:16.942
Okay, um, all right, all right,
gentlemen, let's...

30:19.984 --> 30:21.815
What now?

30:21.886 --> 30:23.547
Let's go see the sheriff.

30:51.216 --> 30:53.343
I only stay at five-star hotels.

30:53.418 --> 30:56.216
Well, you're in luck
'cause this is the Six Star Inn.

30:56.287 --> 30:59.154
Shoot, you're worth four stars
all by yourself.

30:59.224 --> 31:00.851
Is that a compliment?

31:00.925 --> 31:03.485
You're quicker
than a mule gettin' nut kicked.

31:04.629 --> 31:06.324
What is that god-awful racket?

31:06.397 --> 31:07.386
It's my phone.

31:11.002 --> 31:12.094
Hello.

31:12.170 --> 31:15.003
The FBI just paid me a visit.

31:15.073 --> 31:16.700
Con, you okay?

31:16.774 --> 31:18.366
Do you even care?

31:18.443 --> 31:20.240
Course I do. Where you at?

31:20.311 --> 31:21.903
Your place, feedin' the critters.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.709
Hey, where's Wally?

31:23.781 --> 31:25.146
Oh, he's with me.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.911
Those men in black busted in here.

31:26.985 --> 31:29.545
But I chased 'em off with your shotgun.

31:29.621 --> 31:30.747
Girl of my dreams.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.016
Hey, we'd better get off the phone.

31:32.090 --> 31:33.489
They might be tappin' it.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.150
Hey, you better not be tappin' anything.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.820
I wouldn't touch this
Big Bird-lookin' beanpole

31:37.896 --> 31:39.363
with a stolen pecker.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.625
Don't you try to sweet talk me, Larry.

31:41.699 --> 31:43.098
Just keep your hands to yourself

31:43.167 --> 31:45.192
and watch out for those G-men.

31:45.270 --> 31:46.464
All right. Bye, Con.

31:46.537 --> 31:48.767
Bye, darlin'.

31:52.176 --> 31:54.110
If I could understand
what you were saying,

31:54.178 --> 31:55.440
I'd be insulted.

31:55.513 --> 31:57.606
Aw, nothing but compliments.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.311
Come on in.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.551
Cozy.

32:04.622 --> 32:05.850
Got any cash on you?

32:06.858 --> 32:08.189
Cash?

32:09.427 --> 32:10.894
I don't think I got enough money.

32:10.962 --> 32:12.259
Can't use plastic.

32:12.330 --> 32:13.592
Big Brother will trace that.

32:18.002 --> 32:19.264
Check in?

32:20.371 --> 32:24.068
Oh, no, unless it's barbecued.
I'm a steak kind of guy.

32:25.076 --> 32:27.101
Checking. In you're checking.

32:27.178 --> 32:29.112
Oh, checkin' in.

32:29.180 --> 32:30.545
Yeah, right, uh,

32:30.615 --> 32:32.207
Mr. and Mrs. Earnhardt.

32:33.651 --> 32:35.209
Nights, how many?

32:35.286 --> 32:37.481
Oh, just one.

32:37.555 --> 32:38.852
Hold on there, cupcake.

32:38.923 --> 32:39.947
She got to go to the toilet.

32:40.024 --> 32:42.720
You know, female bladders,
like thimbles.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.489
I can see why, though.
We've been driving

32:44.562 --> 32:46.291
all the way, uh, from Miami.

32:46.364 --> 32:47.831
Bed king?

32:47.899 --> 32:49.457
Well, you have to ask her.
I'm pretty good,

32:49.534 --> 32:50.899
but I wouldn't say I'm a bed king.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.459
- What would you think?
- You're not.

32:52.537 --> 32:54.334
You know, maybe a duke or prince.

32:54.405 --> 32:56.305
Size bed. King?

32:56.374 --> 32:59.605
Two twin beds
would be fine, thank you.

32:59.677 --> 33:01.645
As far apart as possible.

33:03.114 --> 33:04.706
Card credit you have?

33:04.782 --> 33:06.716
Credit card? You got
a problem with cash?

33:06.784 --> 33:08.411
The almighty U.S. dollar?

33:08.486 --> 33:10.181
La, la. It's policy.

33:10.254 --> 33:12.222
Policy.

33:12.290 --> 33:14.952
You know what? In America,
the world's freest society...

33:16.561 --> 33:19.792
this note is legal tender
for all debts, public and private.

33:19.864 --> 33:22.059
Can you read English,
there, pamper-head?

33:22.133 --> 33:23.566
Pissing me off you are.

33:23.634 --> 33:25.033
Card credit?

33:25.103 --> 33:26.502
We just been
through that, Mohammed!

33:26.571 --> 33:28.300
- Omar!
- Omar Mohammed

33:28.373 --> 33:29.465
or Mohammed Omar?

33:29.540 --> 33:32.532
Omar Bensaladine Sharif Al Rashan.

33:32.610 --> 33:34.544
Well, son of a bitch,
ain't got to cuss me out.

33:34.612 --> 33:36.842
At least throw in an infidel
or something I can understand.

33:36.914 --> 33:38.438
Go burn a flag,
throw rocks at my embassy.

33:38.516 --> 33:41.041
No card, no key.

33:41.119 --> 33:43.553
Well, that's how
it's gonna be, huh? Looky here.

33:43.621 --> 33:44.610
Oh, boy.

33:47.658 --> 33:49.455
Out of jurisdiction you are.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.729
You forced my hand.

33:53.798 --> 33:54.958
That is what?

33:55.033 --> 33:56.898
There, Johnny Quest,
this here's a swab.

33:56.968 --> 33:59.698
And what it does is test
for explosive "resininity."

33:59.771 --> 34:01.170
Which in case, if I find,

34:01.239 --> 34:04.174
I will tell my friends at the Department
of Homeland Security

34:04.242 --> 34:05.766
and you'll be sitting at Club Gitmo

34:05.843 --> 34:08.107
quicker than you can
say Islamic Jihad,

34:08.179 --> 34:10.340
using your holy book here
for toilet paper.

34:10.415 --> 34:12.849
Credit card no.

34:12.917 --> 34:14.043
Key yes.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.277
Thanks for your cooperation.

34:17.355 --> 34:19.152
Okay, thank you. God bless you.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.885
You're such a nice man.
I love you so much.

34:21.958 --> 34:23.483
You're a funny little feller.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.927
Trash white.

34:29.667 --> 34:31.965
Oh, nice.

34:32.036 --> 34:33.764
What a dump.

34:33.838 --> 34:35.737
I'm famished, and I have to pee.

34:36.774 --> 34:40.801
Well, let me make you
nice and comfortable.

34:40.878 --> 34:43.438
So you see, Sheriff, absolute secrecy

34:43.514 --> 34:46.312
and immediate action
are necessary.

34:46.384 --> 34:47.908
I understand, yes.

34:47.985 --> 34:49.918
This... This Lady X,

34:49.987 --> 34:53.581
if she has vital information
about al-Qeada in America...

34:53.658 --> 34:56.149
Oh, that damn Larry.

34:56.226 --> 34:58.695
I wanted him to take over for me.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.924
The poor simpleton
couldn't catch fish

35:00.998 --> 35:02.431
in a trout pond with dynamite.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.933
Do you think he'll call you?

35:04.001 --> 35:05.696
Me? No.

35:05.770 --> 35:06.794
Then who?

35:06.871 --> 35:09.203
Well, if Connie can't
tell you where he is,

35:09.273 --> 35:12.106
then your best bet would be
Bo, Gus, and Tater.

35:12.176 --> 35:13.438
His law firm?

35:13.511 --> 35:15.672
No, his drinking buddies.

35:16.814 --> 35:19.908
You're a fine officer of the law.

35:19.984 --> 35:21.975
Well, thank you, sir.

35:24.689 --> 35:26.680
Six Star Inn near Brownsville.

35:26.757 --> 35:28.122
Suspicious clerk called it in.

35:28.192 --> 35:30.456
Omar Bensaladine Sharif Al Rashan.

35:30.528 --> 35:34.430
Omar Bensaladine
Sharif Al Rashan, huh.

35:34.499 --> 35:37.161
Sounds like a good American.

35:41.539 --> 35:43.598
Honey, I'm home!

35:44.609 --> 35:45.974
You doing all right in there?

35:47.178 --> 35:50.409
What, are you thinkin' about me
in a pair of little shorty-shorts?

35:52.750 --> 35:54.012
I'm coming in.

35:56.254 --> 35:57.551
Sorry I took so long.

35:57.622 --> 35:59.852
Aw, don't give me that look.

35:59.924 --> 36:02.757
I'm trying to save your life.

36:05.229 --> 36:07.561
Don't do that again.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.260
Ever!

36:10.334 --> 36:13.599
Well, as soon as you trust me,

36:13.671 --> 36:16.299
I can trust you.

36:22.246 --> 36:23.543
Madame.

36:23.614 --> 36:26.174
Château Screw Cap '08?

36:26.250 --> 36:27.512
No, thanks.

36:27.585 --> 36:30.019
All right, well, suit yourself.

36:38.996 --> 36:40.293
What's that?

36:40.364 --> 36:42.229
Wheatgrass with spirulina.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.325
Best stuff in the world for you.

36:44.402 --> 36:45.767
Whew.

36:45.836 --> 36:48.236
Smells like a hot tub
in an old folks home.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.631
Let's eat!

36:58.649 --> 37:00.048
For the lady.

37:00.117 --> 37:02.813
Spinach salad...

37:02.887 --> 37:04.855
with a side of your tofuie.

37:04.922 --> 37:08.255
That ought to taste real good
with that pond scum of yours.

37:08.326 --> 37:10.226
I have a headache.

37:10.294 --> 37:11.693
Probably starvation.

37:11.762 --> 37:13.127
Is that citronella?

37:14.632 --> 37:15.826
I know you don't like bugs, so...

37:15.900 --> 37:18.494
Outdoor use only, Larry.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.161
The fumes are poisonous.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.105
Only thing poisonous
around here is your attitude.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.301
Oh, well, put yourself in my position.

37:25.376 --> 37:29.437
Oh, wait. First you'd have to have
an I.Q. above room temperature.

37:29.513 --> 37:34.416
The last female I was with
that was as warm and cuddly as you

37:34.485 --> 37:36.043
was a porcupine.

37:37.288 --> 37:39.279
And what's that?

37:39.357 --> 37:40.688
Aw, a little present.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.385
I got you some PJs.

37:42.460 --> 37:45.122
Stop trying to be romantic, Shrek.

37:45.196 --> 37:46.356
Romantic?

37:46.430 --> 37:48.660
What, are you trying
to make me blow chunks?

37:48.733 --> 37:51.167
Stuck-up women like you
put a rash on my nuts.

37:53.437 --> 37:54.495
What's so funny?

37:54.572 --> 37:58.167
I, um, owe you an apology.

37:58.242 --> 38:01.006
You owe me about a hundred.

38:01.078 --> 38:02.340
I actually thought

38:02.413 --> 38:05.382
this was some warped stump-jumper's
idea of a seduction.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.474
No, I never jumped
no stumps before.

38:07.551 --> 38:09.985
But I did get a blue ribbon
at the Fair in clog kickin'.

38:10.054 --> 38:12.113
Really? I didn't think
you people actually...

38:12.189 --> 38:14.123
We don't.

38:14.191 --> 38:17.683
Look, you misunderstood
my interior motives.

38:17.762 --> 38:20.060
Typical womanly thing to do.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.065
They all think men think like they do,

38:22.133 --> 38:23.293
when in fact...

38:23.367 --> 38:25.267
Their minds are much simpler
and less developed?

38:25.336 --> 38:27.463
Yeah.

38:27.538 --> 38:29.165
Can we eat now?

38:30.341 --> 38:32.309
I guess that's a yes.

38:52.129 --> 38:54.393
Is that really necessary?

38:54.465 --> 38:55.955
Well...

38:57.168 --> 39:00.228
you believe Bodi is dirty?

39:00.304 --> 39:01.965
Yes.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.565
Heh, nice try.

39:15.086 --> 39:17.077
You get some sleep.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.844
Larry.

39:47.284 --> 39:48.717
Whoa.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.917
They almost busted my rod.

39:56.660 --> 39:59.629
I'll bet that's a 40-pound catfish.

40:02.099 --> 40:04.829
Uh, what the hell?

40:04.902 --> 40:07.496
I can't sleep like this.

40:07.571 --> 40:12.338
Well, we could put the beds together.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.571
I'll find a way to cope. Good night.

40:14.645 --> 40:16.636
Good night, Madeleine.

41:09.166 --> 41:11.191
Betty Jean,

41:11.268 --> 41:13.259
I didn't know you had feelings for me.

41:15.673 --> 41:17.573
Give us a kiss.

41:17.641 --> 41:21.042
Oh, I do have feelings for you.

41:21.111 --> 41:22.703
Didn't I show you that all night?

41:22.780 --> 41:24.145
Ya did?

41:24.215 --> 41:27.048
Yeah, but a girl
needs a rest.

41:27.117 --> 41:28.607
And so do you,
handsome.

41:28.686 --> 41:31.177
You know, I mighta
let you get away with it

41:31.255 --> 41:33.223
if it wasn't
for that last remark.

41:33.290 --> 41:35.019
But even I know
I ain't handsome.

41:35.092 --> 41:36.150
Give me the key.

41:36.227 --> 41:37.694
- Give the key!
- No!

41:52.776 --> 41:55.108
Way to go, chick from <i>Alias.</i>

41:55.179 --> 41:56.771
You done made me swallow the key.

41:58.382 --> 41:59.610
One car, again.

42:00.718 --> 42:02.948
No backup, again.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.885
Still don't think he's dirty?

42:06.624 --> 42:08.649
I think we can make it.

42:09.894 --> 42:11.020
They might shoot at us.

42:11.095 --> 42:13.063
You do have feelings for me.

42:13.130 --> 42:15.155
- They might hit me.
- Well,

42:15.232 --> 42:16.927
then both our troubles will be over.

42:17.001 --> 42:18.161
Come on!

42:47.298 --> 42:49.528
Hold it!

42:52.970 --> 42:56.337
Cease fire, or your witness
will be a Sloppy Joe!

42:56.407 --> 42:57.396
Cease fire!

43:19.997 --> 43:21.487
It's a dud, sir.

43:26.003 --> 43:27.527
Now what?

43:27.605 --> 43:32.804
Now I must do what we were
trying to avoid.

43:32.876 --> 43:34.173
Call Grimsley.

43:41.552 --> 43:42.985
How's that?

43:45.022 --> 43:46.580
No, put somethin' else on.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.833
Man, forget it.

43:59.169 --> 44:01.660
- Gimme some of that sludge.
- What?

44:01.739 --> 44:05.004
Some of that algae juice you drink,
whatever the hell it is.

44:05.075 --> 44:06.337
Yeah, here.

44:06.410 --> 44:09.072
So good for you.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.021
Hey, it ain't too bad.

44:20.090 --> 44:21.318
I know.

44:33.103 --> 44:35.367
Well, that was some good eatin'.

44:35.439 --> 44:37.964
Where the hell is it?

44:39.109 --> 44:40.235
Bingo.

44:44.048 --> 44:45.879
You believe me now?

44:45.949 --> 44:47.177
Maybe.

44:47.251 --> 44:49.742
All right, we're making progress.

44:49.820 --> 44:51.219
Now I'm gonna prove it.

44:53.357 --> 44:55.348
I'm starving how about you?

45:02.266 --> 45:03.961
I thought we couldn't use plastic.

45:04.034 --> 45:05.592
Paper trail? Big Brother?

45:05.669 --> 45:07.967
That was before I was sure

45:08.038 --> 45:10.734
that Bodi and the Three Dwarves
was working alone.

45:10.808 --> 45:13.174
Nail clippers.

45:13.243 --> 45:14.835
What?

45:14.912 --> 45:17.472
Oh, God!

45:20.484 --> 45:24.250
Sir, I strongly suggest
you remove your boots.

45:24.321 --> 45:25.948
You strongly suggest?

45:26.023 --> 45:27.217
That's right.

45:27.291 --> 45:30.419
Well, I'm going to have to firmly decline
your strong suggestion.

45:30.494 --> 45:33.395
Sir, please do not attempt
to enter this area

45:33.464 --> 45:35.022
without removing your boots.

45:35.099 --> 45:36.828
Well, what happened to suggestion?

45:36.900 --> 45:39.232
Your attitude is uncooperative.

45:39.303 --> 45:42.329
Your attitude is snottier
than a teething toddler with a head cold.

45:42.406 --> 45:43.464
Sir?

45:43.540 --> 45:45.064
you are behaving
in a disruptive manner

45:45.142 --> 45:47.076
that may violate federal law.

45:47.144 --> 45:50.807
All right, I'll take off my boots.

45:50.881 --> 45:53.042
But if I do, I got to warn you...

45:53.117 --> 45:54.744
Don't warn me!

45:54.818 --> 45:57.252
Warning a federal official
may constitute a threat

45:57.321 --> 45:58.845
under the Patriot Act.

45:58.922 --> 46:00.514
Well, then I firmly suggest

46:00.591 --> 46:03.025
that you get gas masks
for everybody in this vicinity

46:03.093 --> 46:06.426
'cause to be honest,
last time I took these off in public,

46:06.497 --> 46:09.330
I had skunks coming out
waving white flags.

46:09.399 --> 46:12.027
There is nothing funny
about homeland security!

46:12.102 --> 46:13.831
- You're shoutin'.
- I'm not shouting!

46:13.904 --> 46:16.338
Yeah, you are.
Why are you shouting?

46:16.406 --> 46:17.896
Because I am a deeply insecure,

46:17.975 --> 46:20.170
petty bureaucrat
with a domineering wife!

46:20.244 --> 46:22.371
- And you have a gun.
- You have a gun?

46:22.446 --> 46:24.038
No, I don't have a gun,
you have a gun.

46:24.114 --> 46:25.138
Gun!

46:27.518 --> 46:28.746
Get down!

46:28.819 --> 46:30.252
Bitch!

46:31.288 --> 46:32.915
Don't touch that!

46:32.990 --> 46:34.355
- Hey!
- I got him!

46:34.424 --> 46:35.413
Somebody call the police!

46:57.548 --> 46:58.947
Bad mistake.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.881
Way to go, Michael Vick.

47:10.727 --> 47:11.751
What is that?

47:11.829 --> 47:14.559
I don't know, and I don't want to.

47:16.099 --> 47:17.259
It's disgusting.

47:17.334 --> 47:18.596
Is that hair?

47:19.770 --> 47:21.260
Send in the expert.

47:29.346 --> 47:31.644
Oh, my God.

47:31.715 --> 47:33.012
What is that?

47:33.083 --> 47:34.209
Is it a fuse?

47:34.284 --> 47:35.808
No.

47:35.886 --> 47:36.818
I mean the lumps.

47:36.887 --> 47:37.876
There.

47:39.957 --> 47:41.117
I don't know.

47:41.191 --> 47:42.658
You're the expert.

47:42.726 --> 47:45.320
I'm going in.

48:00.611 --> 48:02.841
Better clear the area.

48:02.913 --> 48:04.744
Let's get out of here.

48:08.585 --> 48:13.522
Sir, I'm going to do
a body cavity search.

48:13.590 --> 48:16.024
I wouldn't if I was you.

48:16.093 --> 48:18.152
It's procedure.

48:26.103 --> 48:27.570
Officer down!

48:27.638 --> 48:29.037
Officer down!

48:33.243 --> 48:36.212
That's how it's done.

48:42.486 --> 48:44.317
Sorry.

48:46.990 --> 48:48.321
Whoa!

48:51.028 --> 48:53.019
Whoa, whoa.

48:55.098 --> 48:56.725
Oh, man.

48:56.800 --> 48:58.700
Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap!

48:58.769 --> 49:00.031
What's with him?

49:00.103 --> 49:01.866
- Hey, it's Grimsley, you know?
- Gentlemen,

49:01.939 --> 49:05.204
I've seen better horsemanship
on the merry-go-round.

49:05.275 --> 49:07.209
I suggest you work on your game.

49:07.277 --> 49:08.676
Otherwise, it's work

49:08.745 --> 49:10.474
you'll be looking for.

49:10.547 --> 49:11.980
Cheerio!

49:12.049 --> 49:13.038
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:14.851 --> 49:17.843
Any calls I should know about?

49:17.921 --> 49:20.583
A man named Bodi.

49:20.657 --> 49:22.284
Get him.

49:22.359 --> 49:24.691
Yes, sir, Mr. Grimsley.

49:28.131 --> 49:29.962
That's him.

49:30.033 --> 49:31.864
No question.

49:31.935 --> 49:35.530
I understand why you
put it on the grid.

49:35.605 --> 49:37.266
But why did you let him go?

49:37.341 --> 49:39.969
If you'd have smelled those feet,
you'd have let him go, too.

49:40.043 --> 49:42.443
Yes, yes, yes.

49:42.512 --> 49:43.877
I'm not surprised

49:43.947 --> 49:46.279
this man's feet caused an incident.

49:46.350 --> 49:47.442
They reek of fear.

49:47.517 --> 49:49.451
But I will follow that...

49:49.519 --> 49:52.511
They were on the 8:30
to Chicago O'Hare.

49:54.091 --> 49:55.718
They did not get on that flight.

49:55.792 --> 49:57.817
I can assure you of that.

50:04.201 --> 50:05.964
Arthur Grimsley.

50:06.036 --> 50:08.470
Oh, yes. Mr. Grimsley.

50:08.538 --> 50:11.507
I trust everything is in order.

50:11.575 --> 50:13.543
Uh, no, um,

50:13.610 --> 50:15.305
everything is not in order.

50:15.379 --> 50:17.745
I couldn't care less about details.

50:17.814 --> 50:19.782
Just get her back!

50:19.850 --> 50:24.878
Under no circumstances
must that woman appear in court.

50:26.656 --> 50:29.557
Reach out for Wilford Duvall.

50:30.594 --> 50:31.959
Look, if Bodi wasn't dirty,

50:32.029 --> 50:34.020
I'd be on the no-fly list by now,

50:34.097 --> 50:36.497
and that little ruckus
would've landed me in jail.

50:36.566 --> 50:38.397
Chocolate praline?

50:40.737 --> 50:42.534
We need to find out
who else is dirty.

50:42.606 --> 50:43.868
Other than your mind?

50:43.940 --> 50:46.773
Who was your prosecutor
on the case?

50:46.843 --> 50:48.470
Mark somebody, I think.

50:48.545 --> 50:51.537
- Mark somebody.
- Yeah.

50:53.950 --> 50:55.349
Come, my precious,

50:55.419 --> 50:57.353
I got you.

50:59.189 --> 51:01.657
Dagnabbit.

51:01.725 --> 51:04.091
Keep your seats, girls, I got it.

51:09.966 --> 51:11.763
Clubhouse.

51:11.835 --> 51:14.030
Hey, quit lighting farts
and listen to me.

51:14.104 --> 51:15.162
Yo, Larry!

51:15.238 --> 51:16.603
Put the smart one on.

51:16.673 --> 51:17.935
Hey, Bo.

51:18.008 --> 51:21.000
Larry wants to speak at ya.

51:24.981 --> 51:26.915
- Yo.
- Do me a favor.

51:26.983 --> 51:29.952
Go on that computer
and punch in the DOJ website.

51:30.020 --> 51:31.578
"Dyno-mite Jugs?"

51:32.622 --> 51:34.556
Department of Justice.

51:34.624 --> 51:37.354
Here's what I need. I need the name

51:37.427 --> 51:39.895
of the U. S. attorney,
Northern Illinois district

51:39.963 --> 51:43.023
and the name of the first
and second chair.

51:43.100 --> 51:45.625
Bean bag and Barcalounger.

51:45.702 --> 51:47.533
Call me back.

51:47.604 --> 51:48.662
What?

51:48.738 --> 51:50.672
How is that possible?

51:50.740 --> 51:52.674
I mean, even in Chicago.

51:54.344 --> 51:55.606
Hang on.

51:55.679 --> 51:56.839
Mark Bedell.

51:56.913 --> 51:58.244
Yeah, Mark, listen.

51:58.315 --> 52:02.081
Uh, this here is the deputy director
of, uh, operations,

52:02.152 --> 52:05.019
uh, FBI Regionalized Field Office

52:05.088 --> 52:07.818
in the, uh, South Central Division

52:07.891 --> 52:11.292
here in the southern area
uh, of the South.

52:11.361 --> 52:12.658
Uh, yes, sir.

52:12.729 --> 52:14.663
Uh, just one moment, please.

52:14.731 --> 52:16.631
I got the Bureau on the other line.

52:16.700 --> 52:18.930
I'll call you back.

52:19.002 --> 52:20.469
How can I help you, Director?

52:20.537 --> 52:22.334
Oh, just call me Larry.

52:22.405 --> 52:24.532
Uh, this is about
Operation Looker Cooker.

52:24.608 --> 52:27.475
Uh, news travels fast, Larry.

52:27.544 --> 52:31.378
Faster than Angelina Jolie
adopting jungle pygmies.

52:31.448 --> 52:32.710
What news?

52:32.782 --> 52:34.079
I thought you were calling...

52:34.151 --> 52:37.086
Uh, never mind, it can wait.

52:37.154 --> 52:38.883
Why did you call?

52:40.824 --> 52:42.018
Well, just to tell you

52:42.092 --> 52:44.322
that Special Agent Bodi
is no longer involved

52:44.394 --> 52:46.021
in the protection of our key witness,

52:46.096 --> 52:49.395
and that I have put myself
personally in charge.

52:49.466 --> 52:50.899
What do you think of that?

52:50.967 --> 52:52.628
I think it's better late than never.

52:52.702 --> 52:54.829
The disk has vanished
from the evidence locker.

52:54.905 --> 52:56.964
The disk has vanished
from the evidence locker?

52:57.040 --> 52:59.167
The disk has vanished
from the evidence locker?

52:59.242 --> 53:00.675
Yes.

53:00.744 --> 53:02.609
You know what that means.

53:02.679 --> 53:05.375
Uh, yes, I know exactly
what that means.

53:05.448 --> 53:07.382
And that knowledge sits heavy,

53:07.450 --> 53:10.817
heavier than Michael Moore
after a Las Vegas buffet.

53:10.887 --> 53:12.411
Could be catastrophic.

53:12.489 --> 53:13.615
And real bad, too.

53:13.690 --> 53:15.317
Protect that witness, Larry.

53:15.392 --> 53:16.620
Oh, you can count on me.

53:16.693 --> 53:19.184
Her testimony is now
more vital than ever.

53:19.262 --> 53:21.093
Hey, listen, Mark. From now on,

53:21.164 --> 53:23.291
just so we can prevent
any more catastrophics,

53:23.366 --> 53:25.459
I think you and I ought to speak

53:25.535 --> 53:27.503
on a secure line, one-on-one.

53:27.571 --> 53:28.970
Good idea, sir.

53:29.039 --> 53:30.233
All right, I'm gonna call you back

53:30.307 --> 53:31.899
- with some more particulars.
- Yes, sir.

53:31.975 --> 53:32.942
10-4.

53:33.009 --> 53:34.874
Ten...

53:34.945 --> 53:36.037
Good-bye, Larry.

53:38.682 --> 53:40.149
What disk?

53:42.319 --> 53:45.516
Well done, Mr. Duvall.

53:45.589 --> 53:48.387
So what about Madeleine?

53:48.458 --> 53:53.725
Oh, Bodi fumbled the cow hide.

53:53.797 --> 53:54.991
You mean pig skin, sir.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.397
Don't correct my use of idiom.

53:57.467 --> 54:00.630
Just secure my witness.

54:00.704 --> 54:01.898
Roger that.

54:01.972 --> 54:04.304
No, don't roger it.

54:04.374 --> 54:06.604
- Sir?
- "Roger"...

54:06.676 --> 54:09.076
is a British idiom for sexual intercourse.

54:09.145 --> 54:10.476
I knew that.

54:10.547 --> 54:11.844
I was just testing you.

54:11.915 --> 54:15.214
Now you're testing my patience.

54:15.285 --> 54:17.276
Get out.

54:29.733 --> 54:30.791
Hey.

54:30.867 --> 54:32.232
Oh, my God.

54:32.302 --> 54:34.270
Yeah. Hearty.

54:34.337 --> 54:36.396
They didn't have
any of that rabbit food you like to eat,

54:36.473 --> 54:40.341
but I did get you some parsley
and some hot sauce.

54:40.410 --> 54:42.207
Strangely,
my appetite has vanished.

54:42.279 --> 54:45.680
Hey, traveling with you
is better than the South Beach Diet.

54:49.953 --> 54:51.682
Oops.

54:51.755 --> 54:53.723
Sorry.

54:55.992 --> 54:58.222
I didn't know it was loaded.

54:58.295 --> 55:00.422
Hey, let me see if I can do it again.

55:00.497 --> 55:01.896
Try it.

55:01.965 --> 55:05.867
And I'll tell them that you consider
facial hair an aphrodisiac.

55:05.935 --> 55:07.459
If them fellers is African,

55:07.537 --> 55:09.266
I'm watching the wrong
Discovery Channel.

55:09.339 --> 55:12.137
Your attempts at humor are feeble,
juvenile, and bigoted.

55:13.343 --> 55:14.640
A trifecta.

55:14.711 --> 55:16.838
Let me ask you something.
If you ever laughed,

55:16.913 --> 55:19.177
will that nullificate
your inheritance?

55:19.249 --> 55:20.307
I laughed.

55:20.383 --> 55:22.248
About those
flannel pajamas, I laughed a lot.

55:22.319 --> 55:23.752
That wasn't fun laughter.

55:23.820 --> 55:24.844
That was to scorn me,

55:24.921 --> 55:26.752
to make me believe I'm beneath you...

55:26.823 --> 55:29.018
when in fact, you're beneath me.

55:29.092 --> 55:32.084
Or anyway, you could be
after four beers.

55:32.162 --> 55:33.424
What inheritance?

55:33.496 --> 55:35.862
A little garlic, some paprika,

55:35.932 --> 55:38.662
genuine casing,

55:38.735 --> 55:41.135
Dimkowski smoked sausage.

55:41.204 --> 55:42.535
Unless I'm mistaken.

55:42.605 --> 55:44.266
How long have you known?

55:44.341 --> 55:45.899
Dimkowski of Chicago?

55:45.975 --> 55:48.136
I mean, that's one
of America's favorite meats!

55:48.211 --> 55:50.441
I grew up in a smokehouse.

55:50.513 --> 55:52.140
Did your little boyfriends
try and kiss you

55:52.215 --> 55:53.409
or lube you up with condiments?

55:53.483 --> 55:56.646
I wouldn't eat another kielbasa
if it meant world peace.

56:00.590 --> 56:02.524
Yeah, the missing disk
contains information

56:02.592 --> 56:04.617
on the money Grimsley stole.

56:04.694 --> 56:06.719
Oh, no, I'm starting
to understand what you say.

56:06.796 --> 56:08.093
What else is on the disk?

56:08.164 --> 56:10.359
Access codes to numbered
accounts in Sweden?

56:10.433 --> 56:11.661
Switzerland, yeah.

56:11.735 --> 56:14.033
And they're after you,
because the codes have codes,

56:14.104 --> 56:16.402
and you have the key.

56:16.473 --> 56:20.273
You are a surprising
individual, Larry.

56:22.112 --> 56:25.548
That, however, was
entirely predictable.

56:28.952 --> 56:30.544
Hey, don't tell anybody.

56:30.620 --> 56:32.986
That ringtone is really
starting to grow on me.

56:33.056 --> 56:35.581
Your secret's safe with me.

56:35.658 --> 56:37.091
Hello.

56:37.160 --> 56:39.788
Madeleine. Wilford Duvall here.

56:39.863 --> 56:41.660
Wilford, this is a surprise.

56:41.731 --> 56:42.925
You all right?

56:42.999 --> 56:44.489
I can't imagine you're being concerned.

56:44.567 --> 56:45.693
Who is it?

56:45.769 --> 56:47.532
You'd be surprised.

56:47.604 --> 56:49.265
Arthur's head of security.

56:49.339 --> 56:51.000
- Give me the phone.
- No.

56:56.646 --> 56:58.079
Who is that? Are you alone?

56:58.148 --> 57:01.208
Uh, yes, I am alone for a minute.

57:01.284 --> 57:02.683
Can you talk?

57:05.622 --> 57:07.749
I'll do my talking on the witness stand.

57:07.824 --> 57:09.485
Tell that to your boss.

57:09.559 --> 57:11.686
He doesn't know
I'm reaching out for you.

57:11.761 --> 57:13.888
Madeleine, let's talk, please.

57:13.963 --> 57:17.057
- About what?
- Me keeping you alive,

57:17.133 --> 57:19.101
and you keeping me
out of the penitentiary.

57:19.169 --> 57:21.364
What kind of trouble are you in?

57:21.438 --> 57:22.666
Arthur's panicking.

57:22.739 --> 57:26.800
He wants to toss me overboard
and sail off into the sunset.

57:26.876 --> 57:28.776
I'm going to need more information.

57:30.547 --> 57:35.917
What kind of leverage
does he have on you, Wilford?

57:35.985 --> 57:37.782
I don't want to say
any more on the phone.

57:37.854 --> 57:38.821
Come on, Madeleine, it's me.

57:40.089 --> 57:41.181
I'll call you back.

57:41.257 --> 57:42.315
On my cell.

57:42.392 --> 57:43.950
Bye.

57:46.463 --> 57:47.555
Well, it does laugh.

57:47.630 --> 57:49.655
Yes, when something's actually funny.

57:49.732 --> 57:52.166
Well played.

57:53.203 --> 57:54.636
Larry?

57:54.704 --> 57:55.966
Yes, Madeleine?

57:56.039 --> 57:58.132
You smell like my childhood.

57:58.208 --> 58:00.335
Well, now who's gettin' romantic?

58:01.778 --> 58:03.746
It's not a turn-on, remember?

58:05.748 --> 58:07.477
Well, I'm spoken for.

58:14.691 --> 58:17.285
Run the trace with NSA SatNet.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.987
The call was made from here.

58:19.062 --> 58:21.826
They're staying
off the interstates and toll roads.

58:21.898 --> 58:23.490
Which is a complete waste of time

58:23.566 --> 58:25.193
because wherever they
use their cell phones,

58:25.268 --> 58:27.862
it's like sending up a flare.

58:30.907 --> 58:33.740
And we're in a pancake house,

58:33.810 --> 58:35.505
Barry Bonds takes steroids,

58:35.578 --> 58:38.513
and the Pope wears a funny hat.

58:40.550 --> 58:43.542
I'm going to kill you,
Agent Orange.

58:43.620 --> 58:45.986
As soon as this is all over,

58:46.055 --> 58:47.818
I'm going to kill you.

58:58.468 --> 59:01.733
So just how well
do you know this Duvall feller?

59:01.804 --> 59:03.066
Ex-military.

59:03.139 --> 59:04.663
Very thorough.

59:04.741 --> 59:06.038
I shook his hand once.

59:06.109 --> 59:08.100
It was like being grabbed
by a steel lobster.

59:08.177 --> 59:09.508
Ooh, what's going on?

59:09.579 --> 59:12.241
Hey, it's a parade!

59:23.059 --> 59:25.550
Lemonade? It's only 25 cents.

59:25.628 --> 59:27.220
Larry, give me some money.

59:28.898 --> 59:30.763
Here you go. Keep the change.

59:30.833 --> 59:32.323
God bless you, ma'am.

59:32.402 --> 59:34.597
God bless you.

59:37.006 --> 59:40.498
Oh, thank you, gorgeous.
Thank you.

59:41.678 --> 59:44.340
Lemonade.

59:47.817 --> 59:49.079
Perfect.

59:58.227 --> 59:59.660
Hey, what's your plan?

59:59.729 --> 01:00:02.596
If Duvall's with us, let's find out.

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:03.597
If he's against us...

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:06.157
Let's find out.

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:07.429
Hey, we're a team.

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:09.061
T-double E-M.

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:16.070
I don't know, it's like Michael Jackson
trying to run a day care center.

01:00:16.145 --> 01:00:17.635
- It don't make no sense.
- What?

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:20.547
A fella buyin' Pamprin. It just don't...

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:21.845
I comprehend the crude similes,

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:23.681
but what they're intended
to illustrate eludes me.

01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:26.722
Look, if this Duvall
fella's on the up and up,

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.087
then how come he
contacted you personally

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:30.523
and not the FBI?

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:32.390
I mean, come on,
he's a military man.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.692
These fellas gotta
go through channels.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:37.289
Do you think
he's attempting subterfuge?

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:39.927
Plus he's trying to fool us.

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:40.935
Look, wait here.

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:42.471
Alone?

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:44.301
If I get killed or captured

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:47.070
or knocked in the head
with a ball peen-hammer, call Doc Savage.

01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:49.441
On my two-way wrist TV?

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:51.605
That's Dick Tracy. Rondog Savage.

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:53.546
My brother-in-law.

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:55.914
He's the medical examiner
around this area.

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:58.180
Black sheep of the family.

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:00.484
He married my sister Bernice.

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:03.116
Boy, she is a big'un.

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.557
We went to the Daytona 500,

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:06.219
and she wore a Goodyear T-shirt,

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:09.924
and some pilot crawled up her ass
and tried to fly her.

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:13.695
Anyway...

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.261
Doc's in the book.
You get in trouble, call him.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:18.273
He'll help you.

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:30.017
Who are you?

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:31.747
I'm Larry.

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:39.627
Man, my hand ain't been this sore
since the first episode of <i>Baywatch.</i>

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:40.788
Where's Madeleine?

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:43.991
Don't worry, she's safer
than Anna Cornucopia at a gay bar.

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:46.262
I'm her handler, and believe me,
she's a lot to handle.

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:52.168
What the hell'd you do that for?

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:55.108
I'm under a lot of stress.
I don't have time for bullshit.

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:56.805
Stress? Ha!

01:01:56.879 --> 01:02:00.576
Try driving around
with Leona Helmsley for about two days

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:03.380
with crooked FBI agents
shooting at ya.

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:06.547
You didn't see me sucker-punchin' people
that are trying to help me.

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:08.487
What do you mean,
crooked FBI agents?

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:11.550
Hold on there,
Mr. Cage Deathmatch.

01:02:11.627 --> 01:02:13.117
You called the meeting.

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:14.891
That's why I ask the questions.

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:17.455
Such as...

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:21.060
If you don't even know that Ricardo Bodi's
working with Arthur Grimsley,

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:24.903
how do you expect
to keep Madeleine alive?

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:29.275
I knew that. I was just testing you.

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:30.403
How can I trust you?

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.970
- Trust me?
- Yeah, trust ya.

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:33.037
Trust this.

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:36.347
Oh. That was a fear fart.

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:46.761
Sorry.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.272
Go, go.

01:02:58.341 --> 01:02:59.330
Go!

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:00.739
I'm in! Go! Go! Go!

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:04.804
What are we gonna do now?

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:06.644
Hell if I know.

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:17.018
Man, this sucks.

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:19.254
You know, I always
wanted to be a G-man.

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:22.559
Seems like the higher up I get,
the more crookeder it gets.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:25.066
I know. That's what I found out
working for Arthur.

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:28.331
I am sick and tired of running for my life.

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:29.837
I thought that was your policy.

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:33.137
When folks is shootin' at me, run.

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:34.870
Who said this?

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:39.278
I'd rather get into
a hearse for my own funeral.

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:40.610
I did.

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:44.079
You know, the only way
to get them folks to back off

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:46.451
is if you give them
the key to the access codes.

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:50.982
Or if I'm dead.

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:54.461
Wait a minute. Sure, I can kill ya.

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:57.226
Then I'd have a lot
of explaining to do.

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:02.696
No, I don't mean really kill me.

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:07.638
Go, Wally.

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:12.273
Yup.

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:20.517
Well...

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.922
I'm gonna miss you, Cocoa Brown.

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:26.894
Been through a lot together.

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:30.194
You know all my secrets,

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:32.097
my moves.

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:37.002
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna replace you.

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:56.186
I'm gonna regret this.

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:02.064
Whoa.

01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:06.860
Damn.

01:05:06.936 --> 01:05:08.801
Man.

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:10.998
That was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:13.064
The truck was a piece of shit, Larry.

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:16.043
Yeah, well, maybe to you,
Miss Lamborganini.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:18.706
Born with a silver
hotlink in your hoo-ha.

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:19.907
Have a little class.

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:21.108
You're lecturing me about class,

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:22.172
with your skid-mark underwear

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:24.219
and your family tree
out of <i>Deliverance?</i>

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:26.915
Look, having money ain't
the same thing thing as having class.

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:29.856
I mean, ain't you ever
had a prized possession?

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:31.223
One-eyed teddy bear

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:34.559
or a piece of glass
polished by the sea?

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.291
Of course not.

01:05:36.365 --> 01:05:37.923
When you can buy everything,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.934
sacrificing something
don't mean nothing.

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:42.163
I haven't even gotten
your malapropisms yet.

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:45.469
Malaprop... You liberals.

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:47.168
Oh, you got an "ism" for everything.

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:48.608
Stop being such a baby.

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.270
Okay, so you had to
give up your truck.

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:53.509
I have to trust my life to a backwoods
physician named Doc Savage.

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:57.416
Well, that's true,
but I also had to give up my possum.

01:05:57.486 --> 01:06:00.478
Oh. Wally.

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:02.456
Stop it, you gonna make me cry.

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:13.034
I thought Botox was just for them
over-the-hill actresses.

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:15.332
It is.

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:19.636
In small doses,
it smoothes out wrinkles.

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:21.370
What about large doses?

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:23.868
It can be fatal.

01:06:23.946 --> 01:06:25.846
What did you say?

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:38.485
What is that?

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:40.756
My wife.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.024
Bernice, my sister.

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:45.556
Remember the one
I was telling you about.

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:49.198
Cute.

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:53.767
Oh, it's okay.
She's just taking a pee.

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:58.370
Now, this here
is my own special formula.

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:02.008
I call it Botox elite.

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:07.044
The trick is to use just the right amount
so that she look dead,

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:10.923
but that she can be revived
easily with the anec-a-dote.

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:15.225
Ronald! Ronald!

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:17.390
Oh, I'm coming, Bernice.

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:23.004
sometimes she needs
help with the, uh...

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:24.300
I really don't wanna know.

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.364
Thank you.

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:30.234
Get up here!

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:32.712
This may take a while.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.925
Nitrous.

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:47.963
It's hot.

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:55.159
Hurry up. They're coming.

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:56.534
No.

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.266
Yes.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:09.445
Hey, Larry! Larry! Get up!

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:15.289
You sure she's gonna come out of this?

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:17.416
Uh, pretty sure.

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:18.755
Say what?

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:21.421
Well, Botox ain't exactly
my field of expertise.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:24.523
I've been working on
a fat dissolver for Bernice.

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:32.970
Welcome, gentlemen.

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:35.908
Would you care to sign
the guest register?

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:38.037
Oh, it won't be necessary.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:41.481
We'd prefer to pay
our respects anonymously.

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:42.482
As you wish.

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:43.540
How did it happen?

01:08:43.618 --> 01:08:46.816
Well, it was a vehicular mishap.

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:51.849
She hit the nitrous
switch instead of the cigarette lighter.

01:08:51.926 --> 01:08:53.417
Was she alone?

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:55.794
There were no other bodies.

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:58.527
Where are her personal effects?

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.504
Uh, there are no personal effects
that I know of.

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:05.870
She sure looks good.

01:09:05.941 --> 01:09:07.670
And so young.

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:10.439
Must be that joy juice
she always drank.

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:11.741
Not even a wrinkle.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.840
Not even a worry line to be found.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.475
Not even a scratch.

01:09:16.551 --> 01:09:18.712
Let's make sure
she's really dead.

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:24.557
All right, you bastards.

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.857
Look what you've done!

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:31.059
She's dead. She's dead.

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:32.862
You want proof?

01:09:34.236 --> 01:09:35.863
You want proof?
You want proof?

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:40.299
There!

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:42.037
How's that?

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.203
Dead enough?

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.678
Larry, control yourself.

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.884
My little innocent lamb.

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:55.624
What do you think?

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.022
He's nuts.

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:58.719
And monkeys throw shit at the zoo.

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:01.354
She was so young.

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:03.660
I need that key.

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:06.565
Forget the key. It's perfect.
Don't you see?

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:09.263
She's dead,
and we had nothing to do with it.

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:10.270
He's right.

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:12.807
With her dead, the key is worthless
without the disk.

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.035
The whole case will collapse.

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.169
Governor.

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:20.873
We were never here.

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.474
Who was never here?

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:25.019
Good man.

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:31.859
All right, let's bring her back now.

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:34.054
Okay.

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:36.896
This better work, or I'll tell Bernice

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:38.297
you've been hiding
the Ding-Dongs on her.

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:40.858
Oh, Jesus, Larry.
Don't even joke like that.

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:48.308
Sweet potato.

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:49.844
Come out of it.

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:51.277
It's Larry.

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:52.507
Talk to me!

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:55.880
Come out of it. This is Larry.

01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:57.111
Speak to me, Madeleine.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.678
Oh, that's not Christian.

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:04.290
That's for slapping me around.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.328
That didn't hurt.

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:07.760
You hit like a girl.

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:14.763
Why can't we just call Mark Bedell?

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:17.203
Oh, yeah, that'll work.
He already lost the disk

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:19.241
and turned you over
to a bunch of crooked G-men.

01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:20.639
I think we can do better than that.

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:22.700
But Larry, why go this way?

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:24.302
Because you're dead,
and I'm out of cash.

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:30.348
No.

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:31.818
No, absolutely not.

01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:34.549
Aw, come on. This'll be fun.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.252
I can't believe
I'm actually going to do this.

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:40.124
I'll go first.

01:11:43.365 --> 01:11:44.957
Forget it, forget it.

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:47.468
Although you're certainly driving me
to the edge of suicide,

01:11:47.536 --> 01:11:49.231
I'm not ready to actually jump.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.296
Well, have it your way.

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.248
You okay?

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:12.260
We look like a couple chicken-fried steaks!

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:28.476
This is Chicago, huh?

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:30.444
Wow.

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:32.980
Yeah. Wow.

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:36.749
Boy, I sure wish Connie
was here to see this.

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:38.446
Who?

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.920
Connie, my girl.

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:46.991
The waitress.

01:12:47.062 --> 01:12:48.427
Yeah.

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:50.522
Boy, she is all woman.

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:10.546
Well, here it is.

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:11.813
Look at this, "The winning team

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:15.516
"automatically gets invited
to the Summer Solstice Ball,

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:17.718
which is inside the mansion!"

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:22.661
When I win that game,
I'll be right in the belly of the beast.

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:24.323
Do you know how to play polo?

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.833
Well, no.

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:27.869
But I know horses, and I know balls.

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:29.836
- I mean, how hard could it be?
- Right.

01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:31.634
I'm coming with you.

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:34.141
When Hillary bakes a batch
of cookies, you are.

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:37.178
Well, you can't do it alone, Larry.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:40.773
Why? 'Cause I'm, as you say,
dumber than a barrel of hair?

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:43.079
Well, now that you mention it.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:44.676
Look, you're dead.

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:46.482
They might get suspicious.

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:48.352
Oh, come on. I'll go incognito.

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:50.016
You got to wear underwear.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.389
I mean, I'll wear a disguise.

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:58.430
You in disguise?
That ain't gonna happen.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.559
What, you don't think I can pull it off?

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:02.035
Look, why don't you
leave the law enforcement

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:03.196
to the professionals?

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.638
Why don't you?

01:14:09.011 --> 01:14:11.741
I'm sorry, Larry. I didn't mean that.

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:33.000
Hey, smell this.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:20.873
What do you think you're doing?

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.145
This ain't the rodeo?

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:27.449
Here we go!

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:32.985
Hyah, now.

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:38.333
Oh, hey!

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.197
Velma Hanes, New Orleans.

01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:42.703
- Morgana Grimsley.
- Oh!

01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:46.240
Lilian Grimoire, Duchess of Darbish.

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:47.741
<i>Enchanté.</i>

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:53.509
Who is that?

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:55.106
That's my cousin Larry!

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:56.081
Aw, damn!

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:03.014
Here we go!

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:04.422
Damn.

01:16:07.362 --> 01:16:10.160
Oh, one for the Queen!

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.590
You're playing dirty, Grimsley.

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:15.432
Piss off.

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:25.371
What the...

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.542
Real nice.

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:43.822
Polo, they call it.

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:46.891
Yep. Real civilized, like.

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:53.266
Yeah, to me it's more like
demolition derby with horses.

01:16:56.144 --> 01:16:57.577
And that's how I'm gonna play.

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:09.216
Get off me.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.288
Grimsley, get your stick off me.

01:17:19.134 --> 01:17:22.126
There you go. Get the ball!

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:23.466
Grimsley.

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:31.104
Whoo-hoo! Larry!

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:33.272
- Whoo-hoo!
- No breeding.

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:34.906
Plenty of class, though.

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:37.816
All of it low!

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:40.950
You know, having class

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:43.583
ain't the same thing
as having money.

01:17:57.572 --> 01:17:59.301
Get off me.

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:03.201
All right? Come on.

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:21.726
Hey!

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.664
Yes!

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:42.676
Well played, for a hillbilly.

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:43.877
Hey, I won.

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:46.113
That means I get to go
to your big hoedown tonight.

01:18:46.188 --> 01:18:47.849
- In your dreams.
- No,

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:49.584
I dream about
getting a nut rub

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:50.818
from Scarlett Johansson.

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.291
That ain't gonna happen.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.851
Nor will you be
attending the ball.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:59.367
Not even if I have the key to get in?

01:18:59.434 --> 01:19:00.731
Darling,

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:02.736
don't get too close
to this diseased rabble.

01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:06.865
Oh, beaten by a farmhand.

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:08.068
Pathetic!

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:11.078
Come now, ladies, let's be gracious.

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:14.741
Larry was victorious today.

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:18.308
Therefore, we will have
the pleasure of his company

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:20.877
tonight at the ball.

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:23.186
What the hell are you doing here?

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:24.885
You're gonna blow everything.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.552
No, I told you I could pull it off.

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:29.188
Just shut up and act natural.

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:33.462
So it's a date, then, tonight.

01:19:33.535 --> 01:19:35.833
Yeah, will do it. Thank you.

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:37.428
Oh, I need a drink.

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:41.203
He is falling right into my trap.

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:45.636
That girl looks familiar.

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:47.545
No.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:52.178
She just has
one of those familiar... asses.

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:54.916
Man, I hate wearing
these uppity clothes.

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:04.559
Hoo, boy! Don't you look finer
than box seats at the Monster Truck?

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.828
And you clean up pretty nice...

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:09.002
yourself.

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:11.061
Well, we all have our assets.

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:15.871
You know, I really don't think
you ought to come.

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.775
Yeah, well, somebody's got
to distract Grimsley

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:18.870
while you're looking for the disk.

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:21.211
Yeah, but it could be dangerous.

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:24.980
Unlike being chased, shot at,
and jumping off bridges?

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:27.988
Larry, you and I,

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:29.523
we're a team.

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:32.219
T-double E-M, "teem."

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:34.421
Let me get my hat.

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.361
You're gonna love this.

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:44.235
I don't like it.

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:45.739
Maybe I won't wear a hat.

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:47.798
There's a lot of people not...

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:52.372
- Now that I like.
- Better.

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:54.438
- Let's go do some good.
- Yes.

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:56.347
Team activate.

01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:03.480
One last question.

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:07.251
Where's the key?

01:21:29.317 --> 01:21:32.252
Welcome, Larry!

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.723
Oh, Miss Hanes,
you look ravishing tonight.

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:38.884
Thank you.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.894
Tell you what, your decorators
must've been busier

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:42.486
than a blow-up doll at a frat party.

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:46.859
Boy, tell you what,

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:49.062
that beef jerky
and marmalade ain't sittin' too good.

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:50.297
Hey, you got a crapper?

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:52.169
I gotta go pinch out a grumpy.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:56.006
Oh, down the hallway,
second to the left.

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:57.977
Hope it's got a plunger.

01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:03.813
Let's adjourn to the ballroom,

01:22:03.885 --> 01:22:06.251
shall we?

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:07.310
May I?

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.234
Don't touch a thing, Doughboy.

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:29.572
This stuff is priceless.

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:30.975
I want that disk.

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:33.105
I want that key.

01:22:33.181 --> 01:22:35.172
Why don't you come and get it?

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:55.364
Crouching tiger.

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:01.568
Winded walrus.

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:08.245
May I have this dance?

01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:09.874
Yes!

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:14.511
Madeleine.

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.790
Let me shake your hand.

01:23:21.863 --> 01:23:24.923
I'm gonna shove that BlackBerry
up where it's gonna be a BrownBerry.

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:42.378
Good save.

01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:43.883
Good save.

01:23:47.088 --> 01:23:49.056
How long have you known?

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:51.024
I suspected from the start.

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:56.223
But I wasn't sure
until I got close enough to smell you.

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:59.323
Funny, all I smell
is the stench of your corruption.

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:02.336
Oh, you used to love my smell.

01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:04.269
That was before you dumped me.

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:06.773
Oh, that was a horrible mistake.

01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:09.332
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:11.641
Do come back, Madeleine.

01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:29.953
I've changed, Arthur.

01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:31.692
I have to do the right thing.

01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:34.257
Then do the right thing.

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:38.861
You can say anything
you want on the stand.

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:41.306
I have the disk.

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:44.402
And without physical evidence,

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:49.974
no jury in Cook County
will take your word over mine.

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:51.916
I have the key.

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:59.891
Oh, do give it to me,
and I will give you half of everything.

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:03.854
Forget it.

01:25:10.805 --> 01:25:12.898
Oh, whoa!

01:25:18.213 --> 01:25:20.807
Hold on, hold on.

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:22.782
Is this really 4th century?

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:24.478
Yes, it is. Roman.

01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:26.543
Why, it's a beautiful piece.

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:50.939
Where's that disk?

01:25:51.012 --> 01:25:52.673
Go to hell.

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:55.646
Is that your final answer?

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:05.983
If you won't talk, maybe this will.

01:26:09.397 --> 01:26:11.729
Complicated, huh?

01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:28.843
No way.

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:31.408
That is cool.

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:39.990
Bingo.

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:50.936
Well, we can have a shoot-out.

01:26:51.005 --> 01:26:52.802
And I surely will die.

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:54.398
But so will you.

01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:55.908
Make me an offer.

01:26:55.977 --> 01:26:58.070
Why don't you come back
from the dark side?

01:26:58.146 --> 01:27:00.137
Help me put Grimsley in the big house,

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:03.309
and I'll tell everybody
you and I was in this together.

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:05.011
The dark side's more fun.

01:27:05.086 --> 01:27:07.748
So is shooting out a window
with a potato gun.

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:15.491
I've got a better idea, Larry.

01:27:17.498 --> 01:27:19.159
Wait in the car.

01:27:25.273 --> 01:27:27.605
You let me go,

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:29.142
clear out the safe,

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:30.643
say there wasn't nothin' in it.

01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:32.771
I can do all that after I kill you.

01:27:32.847 --> 01:27:34.109
Yeah, but my way's better.

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:35.581
That way, nobody
hears the gunshots,

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:36.912
and you ain't got to worry about

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:39.385
disposing of a two hundred and six...

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:41.251
eighteen-pound law man.

01:27:43.057 --> 01:27:44.422
Deal...

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:45.823
or no deal?

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:49.085
Would you like to call a friend?

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:51.688
- Wrong show.
- No, it ain't. Regis host...

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:53.290
Never mind.

01:27:53.368 --> 01:27:54.892
Deal?

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:55.958
Yeah.

01:28:00.908 --> 01:28:02.808
Good luck to you.

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:05.243
- Take care of yourself, Larry.
- I'll do it.

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:13.554
Hey, Enron,

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:15.851
you trying to diddle my cousin?

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:17.891
Get lost, white trash.

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:21.395
Who you calling white trash,
you phony sack of shit?

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:22.827
Get out,

01:28:22.897 --> 01:28:27.630
or I'll break Madeleine's
pretty little neck.

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:31.229
Go ahead, I got a whole
passel of cousins.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:32.295
Did you say Madeleine?

01:28:32.373 --> 01:28:33.772
He knows, Larry.

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:36.002
Does he know the lighter's the key, too?

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:37.738
He does now.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.069
Oh, damn.

01:28:41.683 --> 01:28:43.617
Now I'm madder than
a two-fingered cripple

01:28:43.685 --> 01:28:45.312
trying to return a text message.

01:28:45.386 --> 01:28:48.378
Let's go to the swap meet.

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:52.089
What do you want?

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.559
The key?

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:54.617
Or the girl?

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:56.425
That's a tough question.

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:58.328
Larry!

01:28:59.567 --> 01:29:00.898
I'll take the lady.

01:29:00.968 --> 01:29:04.028
Oh, you're not as stupid as you look.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:06.737
Larry.

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:09.072
I'm impressed.
You chose me over your duty.

01:29:09.143 --> 01:29:11.134
Well,

01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:12.702
not really.

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.645
What did you give Arthur?

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:20.777
Don't tell my heart

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:22.686
My achy breaky heart

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:26.818
I just don't think he'd understand

01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:28.555
And if you tell my heart

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:30.426
My achy breaky heart

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:33.626
I might blow up and kill this man

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.037
- Here they come!
- There they are!

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:55.114
- Good job, Larry.
- Thanks.

01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:56.588
Hey, but Grimsley has the key.

01:29:56.657 --> 01:29:57.851
No problem, we got a copy.

01:29:57.925 --> 01:29:59.688
We kept it separate
from the evidence locker.

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:02.423
Well, I guess
you wouldn't fall in a barrel of titties

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:04.055
and come out sucking your thumb.

01:30:08.603 --> 01:30:10.969
Mr. Grimsley, do you have a statement?

01:30:12.507 --> 01:30:16.910
How do you feel about Madeleine
turning her back on you?

01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:19.276
Larry,

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:22.714
you're better than any FBI agent
I've ever worked with.

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:24.046
Why not make it official?

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:25.449
I appreciate the offer, Mark.

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.387
Once upon a time,
I'd have took you up on that.

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:31.516
Nope, I'm just
a small-town boy at heart.

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:32.524
Good luck then, Larry.

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:34.117
Thank you. Madeleine?

01:30:34.195 --> 01:30:36.527
- In a minute.
- Okay.

01:30:36.597 --> 01:30:38.565
Well?

01:30:38.633 --> 01:30:41.295
You sure you don't
want to stick around?

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:43.963
No, I did my job.

01:30:44.038 --> 01:30:46.666
Tell you what, I'm gonna miss
that pond sludge of yours.

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:49.005
I'm gonna miss your bodily functions.

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:50.202
Really?

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:52.109
No!

01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:56.878
Bye, Larry.

01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:58.509
I'll see you around,

01:30:58.586 --> 01:31:00.178
Longshanks.

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:16.934
I would've retired years ago

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:19.837
but I didn't think you could handle the job.

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:22.467
But I was wrong.

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:23.874
Thanks, Sheriff.

01:31:26.013 --> 01:31:28.208
Ex-Sheriff.

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:31.979
Not so fast, boys.

01:31:37.859 --> 01:31:39.121
Thanks, Con.

01:31:39.193 --> 01:31:43.186
I didn't think I'd ever see you again,
except maybe on <i>Cops.</i>

01:31:43.264 --> 01:31:46.631
Well, guess I had to take
the long way around

01:31:46.701 --> 01:31:52.007
to figure out what I really wanted
was just to be with you.

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:09.186
