02:18.184 --> 02:19.053
Get dressed.

02:19.974 --> 02:23.266
Dude, it’s six am, what are you doing?

02:23.384 --> 02:24.096
We’re going running.

02:24.849 --> 02:26.400
No, I’m going to bed.

02:26.527 --> 02:27.568
I’ll just keep knocking.

02:28.643 --> 02:31.156
Playoff’s are next week. Got to get you ready, man.

02:32.060 --> 02:35.181
Workouts, studying game tapes, whatever it takes.

02:36.517 --> 02:37.240
Why?

02:38.119 --> 02:39.077
Cause I want to win.

02:39.809 --> 02:40.660
And I need your help.

02:41.607 --> 02:44.832
Besides, you stood up to my dad the other day.

02:45.319 --> 02:46.081
I owe you.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.094
So listen.

02:55.497 --> 02:57.090
There’s something that’s been bothering me.

02:58.983 --> 03:03.315
That thing Dan said, about asking my mom what kind of parent he was.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.223
Any idea what he meant?

03:06.787 --> 03:09.762
Probably just more of his mind games, man. That’s the way he is.

03:12.563 --> 03:13.361
You descent?

03:13.510 --> 03:14.528
Clothing wise.

03:16.156 --> 03:17.734
Hey, you’re back online.

03:19.782 --> 03:23.407
Oh, damn, I got dressed in front of that web cam.

03:24.042 --> 03:25.138
Don’t tell me that.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.728
I thought you said that thing was evil, anyway.

03:28.046 --> 03:31.198
Yeah, well that was before I saw you pulling your duffel bag out of the closet.

03:31.444 --> 03:32.997
Were you going to tell me that you’re leaving?

03:33.212 --> 03:34.958
I’m just going down to the keys.

03:35.526 --> 03:37.900
Boat leaves Saturday morning, I’ll be back in six days.

03:37.999 --> 03:39.950
Okay. Five nights to party.

03:40.058 --> 03:43.390
And no time to talk, so, here comes.

03:44.767 --> 03:48.347
Are you comfortable with me seeing Lucas’ mom?

03:48.940 --> 03:52.984
- If it’s too weird for you...
- No, it’s not that. I like Karen.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.021
Something going on with you and Lucas?

03:56.523 --> 03:58.826
Not really. It’s cool.

04:00.250 --> 04:03.262
What if it was too weird for me? You dating Karen.

04:04.101 --> 04:06.891
You’d just have to get used to it.

04:11.178 --> 04:12.135
You do your thing.

04:16.010 --> 04:17.206
Shut that thing off.

04:23.927 --> 04:28.140
Hey, mom. The other night I saw Dan, and he said something.

04:28.370 --> 04:29.522
What now?

04:30.143 --> 04:33.587
He said to ask you what really happened back then.

04:35.394 --> 04:38.399
- Any idea what he meant?
- Who knows. It’s Dan.

04:38.677 --> 04:44.314
Yeah, but, I don’t know. He was talking about what kind of father he was.

04:46.769 --> 04:48.297
Was he just messing with me?

04:51.940 --> 04:56.564
Lucas, you know that I always have your best interest in mind. Since day one.

04:56.647 --> 04:59.269
- You believe that, right?
- Yeah.

05:00.237 --> 05:01.292
Well, um,

05:03.804 --> 05:07.794
after you were born, Dan asked to be in your life.

05:10.477 --> 05:14.015
You told me he never showed up.

05:14.813 --> 05:18.106
- That he didn’t want anything to do with us.
- He didn’t show up at first.

05:18.219 --> 05:22.508
But when he moved back to town with Deb he told me that he’d like to help raise you.

05:23.426 --> 05:25.810
And he asked for joint custody. I said no.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.292
- Why?
- I didn’t trust him.

05:31.203 --> 05:34.930
And Dan was ready to sue until his lawyer told him since he had left me

05:34.980 --> 05:37.577
and gotten another girl pregnant his chances weren’t good.

05:37.829 --> 05:41.142
You know what Dan is like. I had to make a decision.

05:41.186 --> 05:42.861
I had to do what was best for you.

05:43.434 --> 05:48.518
And I knew that someday we’d be having this conversation but that was a risk I had to take.

05:51.054 --> 05:52.180
I’ve got to go to school.

05:53.885 --> 05:54.560
Lucas.

06:00.054 --> 06:01.140
Hey, Peyton!

06:02.276 --> 06:03.284
Come on, can I talk to you?

06:03.841 --> 06:08.032
That depends. Are you telling lies or things that aren’t true?

06:08.159 --> 06:10.084
Okay, I deserve that, but about the other night.

06:10.162 --> 06:12.490
Whatever, Luke. Explain it to your friend Nikki.

06:20.969 --> 06:28.419
So, now that Lucas has out-slutted the both of us, are we back to hoes over bros?

06:28.608 --> 06:32.699
Okay, she’s talking to me, does that mean she’s shopping with me?

06:33.329 --> 06:37.216
I was thinking, maybe we could spend a little trial make up time at the mall.

06:37.405 --> 06:39.156
You know there may be hope for you yet.

06:40.375 --> 06:43.006
Gather around here, come on. Let’s move.

06:45.745 --> 06:46.851
Alright listen up.

06:47.768 --> 06:51.791
Next week you boys are going to be winning your first playoff game.

06:51.934 --> 06:55.324
I however am going to be flat on my back in the hospital.

06:56.236 --> 06:57.334
What’s going on, Coach?

06:57.450 --> 07:02.632
Just a little eye surgery. I’ve got a paranoid doc who says I can’t put it off any longer.

07:03.245 --> 07:08.448
And since it’s important to me to actually see you guys win states,

07:08.646 --> 07:11.278
- I’ve got to miss the first game.
- Who’s going to coach us?

07:11.710 --> 07:13.682
Coach McCallum most likely.

07:14.275 --> 07:19.525
And if you use this as an excuse to slack off I can promise you there’ll be hell to pay.

07:19.621 --> 07:20.706
Now hit the showers.

07:22.563 --> 07:23.630
You need anything, Coach?

07:24.203 --> 07:25.964
Yeah, my youth back.

07:29.328 --> 07:30.470
So, is McCallum any good?

07:30.798 --> 07:33.823
No, JV sucks. This one’s going to be up to you and me.

07:40.141 --> 07:40.781
Keith.

07:41.995 --> 07:45.466
Hey. Just ordered some pizza. You interested?

07:45.594 --> 07:46.266
Sure.

07:47.725 --> 07:50.601
Hey listen, I wanted to ask you something about Dan.

07:51.559 --> 07:53.234
About how he wanted to share custody.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.443
Oh, is he spreading that lie again?

07:56.628 --> 07:59.127
Keith, mom told me it was true.

07:59.193 --> 08:00.586
What do you mean? How he called her from college?

08:00.683 --> 08:01.846
No, after that.

08:03.391 --> 08:05.851
Dan wanted joint custody, I thought you knew that.

08:06.034 --> 08:08.568
No, I didn’t know that.

08:10.016 --> 08:13.698
Do you think things would have been different? If mom would have given him a chance?

08:13.765 --> 08:15.419
You mean like the chance he had with Nathan?

08:15.921 --> 08:18.019
Yeah but what was he like back then, anyway?

08:18.403 --> 08:19.478
What are you thinking?

08:19.582 --> 08:24.744
I mean, it’s easy to see a guy that never cared.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.895
I mean it’s easier to hate him that way. Right?

08:28.674 --> 08:30.928
Well maybe that’s why your mom kept it from you.

08:31.999 --> 08:35.785
Yeah, I know he’s a bad guy,

08:36.263 --> 08:40.763
but maybe he’s just made some poor choices, and it got out of control.

08:42.544 --> 08:45.366
- I mean I’ve been doing that myself.
- Luke, you’re not Dan.

08:47.896 --> 08:50.025
The man’s whole life is poor choices.

08:50.301 --> 08:54.438
Yeah, but that’s just it. Maybe this is the one that changed him.

09:03.758 --> 09:07.400
You are totally saving my life. Thank you. I’ve got to get a cable modem.

09:07.688 --> 09:10.012
It’s cool. I’ve got to run to practice, anyway.

09:11.072 --> 09:15.100
Then I’m going to pick up an extra shift at the mall, try to pay for this cable modem.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.487
And after that, I’m working out with Lucas.

09:17.554 --> 09:19.868
Well who are you and what have you done with my real boyfriend?

09:20.790 --> 09:22.863
Well, you said you wanted me to cut the guy some slack.

09:23.161 --> 09:25.279
You sure it’s not also cause it’s a way to stick it to Dan?

09:25.357 --> 09:27.057
- No, that’s not what it is.
- Okay.

09:27.748 --> 09:30.723
I’m going to stick it to my dad by erasing him from the record books, alright?

09:30.943 --> 09:32.985
- Good.
- I’ve got to go.

09:34.053 --> 09:35.196
I’ll see you.

09:39.375 --> 09:40.733
English class, here I come.

09:47.122 --> 09:48.214
Dan Scott.

09:49.217 --> 09:52.498
They haven’t even cut me open yet and you’ve already smelled the blood.

09:53.025 --> 09:55.290
What’s this I hear about you not coaching the playoffs?

09:55.514 --> 09:58.688
- First game of the playoffs.
- And the last if they lose.

09:59.590 --> 10:01.950
The teams ready. McCallum will do fine.

10:02.473 --> 10:06.741
McCallum, you’ve got to be kidding me. JV’s won what, five games all season?

10:07.070 --> 10:10.807
Well, actually 4. That other one was a forfeit.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.520
Exactly my point. Better let me do it.

10:15.508 --> 10:17.940
I’m old, Danny, but I’m not senile.

10:18.109 --> 10:20.326
Come on, Whitey, you know I know this team as well as you do.

10:20.428 --> 10:25.462
- Every game, every player.
- You ought to. You daddied a half of them.

10:26.039 --> 10:31.787
Okay. Look, I know you don’t care much for me, but you do care a lot about this team.

10:31.841 --> 10:34.504
I care enough about them to protect them from you.

10:35.393 --> 10:38.426
- Over my dead body, Danny.
- Well if that’s the way you want it.

10:39.956 --> 10:41.575
Oh, by the way...

10:42.840 --> 10:46.658
I’m going to be just fine, thanks for asking.

10:53.842 --> 10:54.964
My legs are dead.

10:56.540 --> 10:58.537
Come on, one more game, man, see what you’ve got.

11:08.321 --> 11:09.290
Nice shot, Haley.

11:17.767 --> 11:19.810
So did Dan talk about me when you were little?

11:23.825 --> 11:26.867
Well, when I was younger I used to hear my parents argue about you.

11:27.772 --> 11:31.664
I knew you were out there. And I hated the fact so I hated you.

11:33.631 --> 11:35.591
I just thought what my dad wanted me to think.

11:36.881 --> 11:39.262
It sounds stupid but it made sense at the time.

11:41.428 --> 11:45.305
You know he wanted joint custody of me. That’s what he was talking about at the jail.

11:46.441 --> 11:48.877
Wow. I didn’t see that coming.

11:51.483 --> 11:53.982
The one descent thing the guy does and he buries it, huh?

11:54.053 --> 11:58.452
So you think if Dan would have gotten his way, you and I might have grown up together?

11:58.656 --> 11:59.842
What would that have gotten us?

12:01.063 --> 12:02.794
Well we could have teamed up against him.

12:03.208 --> 12:04.688
Or we could have killed each other.

12:05.912 --> 12:08.108
Trust me, man, you didn’t miss out on anything.

12:10.264 --> 12:13.700
Until the latter part of his life, Darwin was a naturalist

12:13.808 --> 12:18.327
and the author of the book “The Origin of Species” which was published in…

12:51.533 --> 12:52.867
Keith, hey.

12:53.175 --> 12:54.716
Lucas came to see me last night.

12:57.384 --> 12:59.259
He had a lot of questions about what you told him.

13:00.123 --> 13:00.923
About Dan.

13:02.208 --> 13:03.379
And he wasn’t the only one.

13:03.841 --> 13:07.163
- You have a right to be upset.
- You’re damn straight I have a right to be upset!

13:07.803 --> 13:11.368
You want to explain to me how you could keep that from me all these years?

13:12.681 --> 13:14.497
I had a right to know Dan wanted custody.

13:14.572 --> 13:16.143
What would you have done differently?

13:17.039 --> 13:19.533
- Would you have loved Lucas any less?
- Of course not.

13:20.193 --> 13:22.067
But I might have had a different opinion of my brother.

13:22.172 --> 13:27.281
Oh come on, Keith. Your opinion of Dan is based on more than just his behavior towards Lucas.

13:28.002 --> 13:32.328
Back then, he told me that he approached you about joint custody, okay?

13:33.024 --> 13:36.679
And I called him a liar. And now I find out the person lying was you.

13:36.737 --> 13:40.120
I was trying to protect Lucas! I was trying to give him the best life possible.

13:40.996 --> 13:44.738
I was a kid, Keith. And I was scared.

13:45.533 --> 13:49.875
I was scared I was going to lose you too. You and Dan are brothers there was always that chance.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.696
What, that I’d take his side over yours?

13:53.506 --> 13:54.427
Well yeah.

13:56.572 --> 13:59.822
God, Karen, I thought you knew me better than that.

14:15.705 --> 14:17.441
I was just leaving you a note to call me.

14:17.671 --> 14:20.497
I thought you had to invite vampires in.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.719
I’m all talked out with you.

14:23.815 --> 14:27.620
That may well be but I’m still going to need your playbooks, stats, team rosters,

14:27.762 --> 14:29.519
but don’t you worry, I’ve got my own whistle.

14:29.815 --> 14:31.224
What the hell are you talking about?

14:31.864 --> 14:34.183
Looks like I’ll be coaching that playoff game after all.

14:34.270 --> 14:37.363
The hell you will, I told you my decision was final.

14:37.451 --> 14:40.405
So was the athletic committees. And I believe they trump you.

14:40.480 --> 14:45.764
We had a little session this afternoon. You really should get yourself a cell phone Whitey.

14:50.093 --> 14:52.949
Just what I was looking for. Don’t you worry Whitey.

14:53.845 --> 14:55.043
The teams in good hands.

14:59.500 --> 15:03.250
So I hope you don’t mind I had to bring Jenny along. Jake kind of asked last minute.

15:03.332 --> 15:07.647
Well it’s never to early to learn to accessorize, right? Want to go look at cds?

15:07.762 --> 15:11.258
Why? So I can listen to you complain as I check out all the new releases?

15:11.360 --> 15:15.773
Well we could go try on lingerie and you can listen to me whine about how fat I am.

15:15.881 --> 15:19.224
- You’re not fat.
- I know, I just like to hear it.

15:20.238 --> 15:22.404
You know, I’ve really missed this whole girlfriend thing.

15:23.111 --> 15:24.427
Of course you have.

15:25.113 --> 15:28.353
Well, well, well. As a babysitter, apparently you suck.

15:28.727 --> 15:31.078
- Nikki, what are you doing?
- Protecting my baby.

15:31.185 --> 15:35.087
While you two barbies were getting ready to make out, anybody could have taken her.

15:35.179 --> 15:36.126
Put her down.

15:36.294 --> 15:38.374
Right, I take orders from you.

15:39.490 --> 15:41.773
- Where are you going?!
- Shopping with my daughter.

15:41.866 --> 15:45.010
- I don’t think so.
- Yeah, I see you stopping me.

15:46.418 --> 15:48.597
- Nikki!
- Go get security, okay?

15:52.007 --> 15:54.405
Nikki. Nikki!

15:54.561 --> 15:55.706
Where is my phone?

15:56.780 --> 15:58.793
Damn it! Where is my phone?

15:59.705 --> 16:00.703
Nikki!

16:07.877 --> 16:09.669
- Hi, can I use this?
- Sure.

16:09.770 --> 16:10.508
Thank you.

16:14.638 --> 16:16.902
Karen, hey, it’s Peyton, is Jake there?

16:18.378 --> 16:20.097
No, he can’t call me back, I’m...

16:20.999 --> 16:22.130
Well where is he?

16:28.358 --> 16:32.809
- Peyton. Where is she?
- I lost her in the crowd. This isn’t happening.

16:32.877 --> 16:36.866
Police are on their way, miss, security’s been notified. If she’s still here we’ll find her.

16:36.943 --> 16:39.041
What if she’s already gone? What are we going to do?

16:39.758 --> 16:40.706
It’s okay, come here.

16:47.064 --> 16:47.863
Hey, Hales.

16:48.882 --> 16:53.249
Check it out, an entire afternoon together and no one threw a punch.

16:54.125 --> 16:54.867
You okay?

16:55.041 --> 16:56.772
Can I talk to Nathan alone please?

16:58.144 --> 17:00.687
Yeah sure. Catch you guys later.

17:02.490 --> 17:03.418
What’s up?

17:06.710 --> 17:12.921
I was just doing some research on the internet and I found what my boyfriend’s been studying.

17:15.240 --> 17:19.196
This is, I just stumbled upon this, so, it’s no big deal.

17:21.829 --> 17:25.357
What about the half a dozen other sites that you stumbled upon and book marked?

17:26.079 --> 17:29.756
It’s hard enough for me that I have to compete with the girls at school that just give it away,

17:29.805 --> 17:33.340
- now I’ve got to be a porn star?
- Haley, look, you’re over reacting.

17:33.431 --> 17:36.401
No, I really don’t think that I am. This hurts me, Nathan.

17:36.488 --> 17:39.688
Why? Haley these girls aren’t real.

17:39.765 --> 17:43.221
And plus, I’m a guy. Guys look at this stuff.

17:43.287 --> 17:45.669
Well don’t be a guy, Nathan, be a man.

17:47.465 --> 17:49.529
You know, I’m not a prude, and I think you know that.

17:49.770 --> 17:53.923
But the thought that this is what I’m going to be compared to?

17:54.014 --> 17:55.274
So that’s what this is?

17:55.682 --> 17:57.480
You’re worried I’m going to compare you to them when we-

17:57.536 --> 18:00.429
Yes! I’m afraid, that’s part of it.

18:01.372 --> 18:05.047
Nathan it’s hard enough for me to even think about being naked in front of you.

18:05.218 --> 18:08.304
And the thought that this is the standard I’m going to be held to?

18:10.224 --> 18:11.104
Forget it.

18:11.909 --> 18:12.804
Haley.

18:18.755 --> 18:20.408
Peyton. Have they found her?

18:20.643 --> 18:23.583
Not yet. God, Jake, I am so, so sorry, okay?

18:23.649 --> 18:25.298
We only looked away for like two seconds.

18:25.380 --> 18:26.639
You cannot do that!

18:26.747 --> 18:29.174
You just need to calm down, sir, we have officers combing the mall.

18:29.252 --> 18:30.934
Oh, calm down, take it easy? What do you think...

18:31.000 --> 18:31.754
Hey.

18:34.335 --> 18:36.526
- What’s going on?
- What the hell are you doing, Nikki?

18:36.757 --> 18:39.235
I took Jenny shopping then we rode on the carousel.

18:40.432 --> 18:41.482
What? What’s the big deal?

18:41.559 --> 18:43.029
You stole her out of her stroller!

18:43.331 --> 18:46.342
No I didn’t. I picked her up because you two weren’t watching her

18:46.444 --> 18:50.647
and then I told you I was taking her shopping. Besides she’s my daughter, not yours.

18:50.821 --> 18:52.880
- Is that true?
- Well, yes, but...

18:52.936 --> 18:54.086
Which one of you has custody?

18:54.185 --> 18:56.126
Okay, look, she took off as soon as the baby was born.

18:56.192 --> 18:59.848
As long as this isn’t a custody matter I’d advice you kids to keep your family stuff at home okay?

19:00.509 --> 19:01.702
You can call off the dogs.

19:02.905 --> 19:04.933
You are unbelievable, you know that?

19:05.178 --> 19:08.643
- Hey, if you’d let me see her once and a while.
- That’s not going to happen, not after this.

19:08.706 --> 19:10.062
You think I’m such a bad mother?

19:10.272 --> 19:12.901
You’ve made some pretty bad decisions when it concerns Jenny.

19:13.646 --> 19:14.992
I’m not sure I can trust you with her.

19:15.064 --> 19:16.903
- Nikki.
- I’m going to get custody, Jake.

19:17.681 --> 19:23.917
She’s better off with me. I’ll see you soon, bunny! Yes!

19:33.039 --> 19:33.784
Jake...

19:44.305 --> 19:45.728
Haven’t worn out your welcome yet?

19:46.159 --> 19:48.918
No, in fact Karen made me her partner.

19:49.161 --> 19:50.838
I hope you mean in the business.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.366
- You said you had something for me.
- Yeah.

19:57.650 --> 20:00.254
You left this on the bedroom floor the other night.

20:02.759 --> 20:04.947
What makes you think I didn’t leave it there as payment?

20:06.821 --> 20:07.797
Excuse me, Deb.

20:09.538 --> 20:10.787
Dan, may I have a word with you?

20:18.395 --> 20:22.154
Is it just sport? This need to agitate Lucas any chance you get.

20:22.593 --> 20:25.317
Why on earth would you tell him that you wanted custody?

20:25.450 --> 20:27.924
I’m not the devil, Karen. I’m tired of being blamed for everything.

20:28.025 --> 20:30.350
Not everything. Just your due.

20:30.703 --> 20:35.476
You suggest to me that I abort my child and then one day you grow this tiny sliver of conscience

20:35.567 --> 20:38.577
that has long since disappeared and you expect a medal for that?

20:38.643 --> 20:41.178
No, I expect you to be held as accountable as I have to be.

20:41.287 --> 20:42.898
You’re the one who kept the truth from him.

20:43.919 --> 20:45.955
This is not about accountability.

20:46.452 --> 20:49.759
You don’t regret missing out on Lucas’ life, you hate the fact that I beat you.

20:49.883 --> 20:52.177
And you’re punishing him because some lawyer told you years ago

20:52.228 --> 20:55.418
that you could never win this one and that is pathetic, Dan!

20:55.919 --> 20:58.531
So do me a favor, just stay away from him.

20:58.946 --> 21:00.159
I can’t do that.

21:00.978 --> 21:02.227
I’m his coach.

21:02.775 --> 21:04.030
What are you talking about?

21:04.223 --> 21:06.328
Whitey’s off in surgery, I volunteered to step in and help.

21:07.477 --> 21:09.528
You just can’t let this one go, can you?

21:09.638 --> 21:11.392
Well it beats lying about it.

21:12.432 --> 21:13.702
Listen to me, Dan.

21:14.572 --> 21:16.851
If you use this coaching job to hurt my son,

21:17.158 --> 21:20.742
I don’t care who on that school board you sold cars to, I will bury you.

21:20.864 --> 21:24.127
You shouldn’t baby the kid, Karen. The boy needs to learn to fight his own battles.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.595
Is that why Nathan left you?

21:41.382 --> 21:44.131
Peyton. Hello!?

21:44.444 --> 21:47.316
Oh, hey. Sorry I didn’t hear you.

21:47.670 --> 21:49.528
It’s okay. You alright?

21:49.660 --> 21:54.739
Not really. I screwed up pretty bad with Jenny yesterday.

21:54.908 --> 21:56.880
Sorry. Is she okay?

21:57.094 --> 22:02.475
Yeah, yeah she’s fine. It just potentially could have been so bad.

22:02.998 --> 22:04.248
I’m an idiot.

22:05.748 --> 22:07.104
- What’s going on?
- Oh, nothing,

22:07.186 --> 22:10.320
I was going to dump my problems on you but you’ve got enough to worry about.

22:10.376 --> 22:12.462
No, it’s cool. What’s up?

22:13.852 --> 22:21.313
Okay, um, I was over at Nathan’s and I was on his computer,

22:21.912 --> 22:24.580
and I came across all this creepy porn.

22:25.138 --> 22:27.928
How creepy? Like she-male midgets?

22:28.177 --> 22:32.193
No, like, Pamela Anderson wannabes.

22:32.368 --> 22:36.395
And, I’m right to be bothered by this, right?

22:36.468 --> 22:39.617
I mean you would be bothered by this if you guys were still together.

22:40.517 --> 22:44.492
Well, not really. But our relationship was nothing like yours.

22:44.562 --> 22:46.037
- Because you were having sex.
- No!

22:46.667 --> 22:49.519
Because I was never in love with Nathan the way you are.

22:52.571 --> 22:55.351
You know, he says he’s totally cool with waiting until I’m ready,

22:55.458 --> 23:00.030
but if he’s filling up with cyber-sex in the mean time, I’m not going to measure up to that.

23:00.235 --> 23:03.388
Haley. But you don’t have to compete with anything.

23:04.260 --> 23:05.734
You’ve got something they don’t.

23:07.088 --> 23:08.704
You’ve got his heart, too.

23:16.291 --> 23:19.415
I heard it only took my dad 15 minutes to BS the athletic committee.

23:20.209 --> 23:21.468
We’re so screwed, man.

23:22.462 --> 23:23.828
Only if we let him get to us.

23:28.949 --> 23:33.021
So, you going to tell me what happened with Haley?

23:34.332 --> 23:36.361
I called her last night and she wouldn’t pick up.

23:36.753 --> 23:40.007
Let’s just say she found out I was looking at some websites

23:40.104 --> 23:42.401
that don’t exactly make me boyfriend of the year.

23:43.782 --> 23:46.189
Alright, not that it’s any of your business, but...

23:48.501 --> 23:52.654
Haley and I, we’re not, I mean she’s not, you know,

23:52.726 --> 23:56.513
so, I’m just trying not to pressure her, that’s all.

23:58.399 --> 23:59.541
Yeah, sure.

24:03.630 --> 24:06.801
- Porn freak.
- What? Shut up, dude.

24:07.314 --> 24:09.960
Just stay away from the sites with farm animals, alright?

24:10.360 --> 24:11.144
Oh man.

24:13.423 --> 24:14.926
What are you talking about?

24:24.033 --> 24:26.670
Most fathers would be touched by that scene.

24:27.909 --> 24:30.387
But I’m guessing it’s our worst nightmare.

24:31.336 --> 24:32.107
Coach.

24:46.500 --> 24:47.689
Luke, can I talk to you?

24:51.861 --> 24:56.863
I owe you an apology. I shouldn’t have lied to you about Dan.

24:58.419 --> 24:59.504
No you shouldn’t have.

25:00.489 --> 25:02.777
And I understand if you’re upset.

25:03.212 --> 25:04.573
I don’t think you do.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.734
I just can’t turn it off.

25:11.787 --> 25:16.479
All these years I was sure I should hate him, because he didn’t want me.

25:18.234 --> 25:20.118
I guess I’m mad at you,

25:21.178 --> 25:23.098
for making me question that now.

25:23.912 --> 25:25.305
I’m not sure I should hate him.

25:27.741 --> 25:29.447
I’m not even sure I know him.

25:29.821 --> 25:30.798
Do you want to?

25:31.147 --> 25:32.498
You loved him once, mom.

25:35.151 --> 25:36.651
Was there ever something there?

25:37.284 --> 25:38.786
Was he ever a good person?

25:39.697 --> 25:43.506
Once upon a time. He was.

25:43.845 --> 25:46.794
But he hasn’t been that person for a long time.

25:55.348 --> 25:56.486
Hold your position.

25:58.786 --> 25:59.993
Where’s Jagielski?

26:01.212 --> 26:03.551
Sometimes coach lets him miss practice because of his baby.

26:03.634 --> 26:08.083
Sounds like Whitey. There’ll be no more special treatment for anyone, understood?

26:08.537 --> 26:10.654
Now this ball control offense Whitey’s running is out.

26:11.161 --> 26:14.861
From now on it’s run and gun. Players make plays.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.212
But we’re undefeated and we’re going to playoffs.

26:17.283 --> 26:19.481
By the way, you’re benched. Anyone else?

26:21.758 --> 26:22.552
Good.

26:27.620 --> 26:28.354
Is this bad for your shoulder?

26:29.389 --> 26:30.011
Probably.

26:31.291 --> 26:32.326
Alright, free throws.

26:32.940 --> 26:37.764
Make ten in a row, miss one, grab a weight plate and run and start over. Let’s go.

26:41.676 --> 26:42.643
Bend your knees, Nathan.

26:43.083 --> 26:46.360
- I just made it, didn’t I?
- Hey. Whitey let you mouth off like that?

26:47.018 --> 26:47.788
Bend your knees.

26:53.753 --> 26:55.550
Grab a weight plate. Next.

27:05.164 --> 27:07.603
Go join your new pal. Next.

27:11.919 --> 27:13.378
Sprints, not runs!

27:19.993 --> 27:21.443
Lucas, keep moving!

27:22.252 --> 27:23.579
Let’s go, let’s go.

27:26.716 --> 27:29.461
- I’m still a little weak from the accident.
- You’re a little weak all right.

27:30.754 --> 27:33.404
- Oh, dad!
- Coach.

27:33.680 --> 27:35.195
Now get a mop, clean that up.

27:36.173 --> 27:38.247
Let’s go, quit slacking, let’s go.

27:42.569 --> 27:45.712
- What happened to you?
- First practice with Dan.

27:46.270 --> 27:48.421
- That brutal, huh?
- Uh huh.

27:50.151 --> 27:52.777
Especially for Nathan. Poor guy.

27:53.444 --> 27:56.131
- You’re concerned about Nathan?
- Well yeah.

27:57.279 --> 28:00.811
I saw first hand today how horrible it is with him and Dan.

28:01.393 --> 28:02.860
He needs you, Hales.

28:05.173 --> 28:08.773
Maybe you should cut him a break on this whole internet thing.

28:10.701 --> 28:14.887
- He told you about that?
- Yeah. I know, it’s weird, right?

28:15.378 --> 28:20.212
But we’re talking more now, and, at least he’s not cheating on you.

28:20.447 --> 28:24.640
- Ha! He’s looking at plastic bimbos.
- Hey, it could be worse.

28:27.517 --> 28:32.023
Did you ever think that maybe all this is just helping him so he can give you space,

28:32.090 --> 28:35.290
- so he doesn’t have to hassle you about sex?
- He shouldn’t need help giving me space,

28:35.356 --> 28:37.656
he should be better than that. Especially if he loves me.

28:37.723 --> 28:41.941
And I cannot believe that you’re defending him, whose protecting my heart in this, Luke?

28:41.997 --> 28:45.202
Okay, okay, I didn’t say it was okay. Alright?

28:46.164 --> 28:48.797
I’m just saying, after what I saw in the gym today,

28:50.261 --> 28:52.980
man, the guy just needs a little support.

29:08.916 --> 29:13.332
Jake, I feel so horrible, you have every right to be mad at me.

29:13.429 --> 29:15.492
I’m mad at Nikki, okay? You I’m just...

29:16.828 --> 29:18.293
I’m just disappointed in.

29:19.025 --> 29:22.231
- It was two seconds.
- A lot happened in those two seconds.

29:23.634 --> 29:27.029
I just got off the phone with the legal aid attorney and she said that Jenny’s fair game

29:27.131 --> 29:31.222
and if it goes to court, that the judge usually decides with the birth mother.

29:31.320 --> 29:33.843
Even if you can prove what a horrible person she is?

29:34.918 --> 29:35.905
You saw how she played that cop in the mall.

29:36.018 --> 29:38.405
She’s going to do the same thing to a judge in court.

29:39.101 --> 29:40.484
What if she wins, Peyton?

29:41.215 --> 29:43.621
I mean, I could lose Jenny.

29:45.052 --> 29:46.581
I’m so sorry.

29:49.331 --> 29:51.441
- I’ve got to get out of here.
- Where would you go?

29:51.922 --> 29:55.870
- I have a cousin in Savannah. Maybe?
- Won’t that just make things worse?

29:57.871 --> 30:03.079
If Nikki comes after Jenny, this lawyer said it could end up costing me a fortune to fight her.

30:03.166 --> 30:05.465
And my parents, they’re already struggling as it is.

30:05.909 --> 30:08.732
This would wipe them out, I can’t do that to them.

30:09.821 --> 30:12.616
The only thing that I know for sure is that if I stay here,

30:14.312 --> 30:15.540
I’m screwed.

30:20.304 --> 30:23.528
Where did I put that picture of Darwin?

30:50.504 --> 30:54.083
You, um, said they weren’t real people.

30:55.180 --> 30:56.194
Haley, what are you doing?

30:56.588 --> 31:03.682
I’m a real person. I have feelings, I have problems, I feel vulnerable, and self-conscious and...

31:05.982 --> 31:08.999
- I’m just like every other person.
- I know that.

31:09.076 --> 31:12.931
Well what happened to sex just being magical,

31:13.024 --> 31:17.016
and being this amazing expression of how much you love someone?

31:18.498 --> 31:23.920
These cyber girls, they’re just like triple jointed and waxed,

31:24.058 --> 31:29.838
and always turned on, and it’s just a lie.

31:30.043 --> 31:32.607
I understand that. It’s just a fantasy.

31:37.482 --> 31:39.044
Is Peyton a fantasy, too?

31:48.304 --> 31:51.618
You know, it’d be nice if a guy could have a little privacy in his own apartment.

31:53.574 --> 31:55.576
I can’t be Peyton for you.

31:56.028 --> 31:59.467
I can’t be those girls. I just, I won’t.

31:59.554 --> 32:02.411
- I don’t want you to be.
- Are you sure about that? Because...

32:13.266 --> 32:14.715
I gave you my heart.

32:16.952 --> 32:18.744
That’s all that I can give to you.

32:21.171 --> 32:25.124
And if that’s not enough for you, then I’m not enough for you.

32:37.785 --> 32:41.027
So can I ask you a question? Were you serious about getting out?

32:42.379 --> 32:43.044
Yeah.

32:44.533 --> 32:45.650
I’m sure going to miss you.

32:48.975 --> 32:51.861
I’ve got a way for you to leave but you’ve got to go in the morning.

32:54.631 --> 32:57.687
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

32:58.429 --> 32:59.397
What are you talking about?

33:00.018 --> 33:01.789
My dad’s transport is leaving for the keys.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.154
Did you ask your cousin about staying with him?

33:04.338 --> 33:05.470
Yeah, but he’s in Savannah.

33:05.691 --> 33:08.425
Well my dad docks near there and a couple of other places on the way.

33:09.458 --> 33:12.669
Look, if you take your car Nikki can follow you, but this way-

33:15.353 --> 33:17.118
I don’t want you to go, Jake.

33:17.916 --> 33:19.882
But if you think it’s the best thing for Jenny...

33:21.435 --> 33:24.076
I was thinking about how crushed my parents would be if I left.

33:25.351 --> 33:26.339
But Nikki...

33:28.161 --> 33:31.096
I mean she’s been so bad to my world, already. And not just to me

33:31.157 --> 33:33.427
but to you and to Lucas and Brooke.

33:34.636 --> 33:36.513
If I stay, she’ll win custody, Peyton.

33:38.988 --> 33:39.837
I can’t have that.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.001
The boat leaves in the morning.

33:42.836 --> 33:44.280
And your dad’s cool with this?

33:45.019 --> 33:46.666
I’ll just tell him you’re visiting relatives.

33:47.654 --> 33:50.317
He’s a father too, Jake, he’d do anything for his daughter.

33:51.166 --> 33:52.943
- Just like you.
- What do you think, Jenny?

33:55.196 --> 33:57.305
I’ll be there in the morning either way.

34:04.540 --> 34:06.757
Package for Deborah Scott?

34:07.336 --> 34:07.986
I’m Deb.

34:11.217 --> 34:11.786
Thanks.

34:24.132 --> 34:24.969
Is it bad news?

34:26.726 --> 34:28.067
Our divorce papers.

34:29.614 --> 34:32.907
Once they’re signed and filed it will all be over.

34:34.422 --> 34:36.402
That’s what you wanted, isn’t it?

34:37.985 --> 34:41.400
Yeah, I’m just surprised.

34:43.148 --> 34:44.996
I never expected to feel sad.

35:43.852 --> 35:44.859
Hey.

35:46.708 --> 35:48.679
I was kind of hoping you wouldn’t show.

35:50.164 --> 35:52.934
Jenny you be good, okay? Take care of your dad.

35:54.490 --> 35:56.308
- Peyton.
- Look, don’t say anything.

35:57.419 --> 35:58.552
You guys just be safe.

36:40.914 --> 36:41.667
Hey.

36:43.923 --> 36:44.591
You okay?

36:45.389 --> 36:46.771
I’ve got some stuff going on.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.071
I know.

36:51.282 --> 36:54.447
Look I just wanted to apologize, again,

36:55.931 --> 36:57.871
for not being a better person lately.

37:00.058 --> 37:01.266
I’m trying, Peyton.

37:05.838 --> 37:07.175
I don’t know what else to say.

37:07.815 --> 37:11.436
It’s not about what you say, Luke. It’s about what you do.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.958
You don’t like the person you’ve become? Then do something about it,

37:14.030 --> 37:16.283
- cause no one’s going to do it for you.
- I know.

37:18.470 --> 37:19.735
That’s why I came by.

37:22.504 --> 37:24.189
I’m going to be making a few changes.

37:26.376 --> 37:28.597
And I just wanted to see you before I do.

37:33.892 --> 37:35.048
I’ll be seeing you, Peyton.

37:48.898 --> 37:49.435
Hi.

37:50.061 --> 37:50.536
Hi.

37:53.033 --> 37:54.024
I didn’t want this.

37:56.194 --> 37:57.044
What’s that?

37:57.919 --> 37:59.988
This. You’re moving away.

38:01.943 --> 38:03.147
You’re upset with me.

38:04.005 --> 38:08.241
Well neither of us wanted it, but somehow here we are.

38:08.626 --> 38:09.762
Did I trap you?

38:10.780 --> 38:13.459
Did I lead you on and trick you into loving Lucas?

38:14.159 --> 38:16.552
No and you didn’t trick me into loving you either.

38:18.462 --> 38:19.717
But that’s what happened.

38:21.268 --> 38:25.629
And the fact that I lied about Dan’s intentions, does that change all that?

38:26.497 --> 38:28.620
- It colors it differently, yeah.
- How?

38:30.063 --> 38:33.044
Because no matter what I said back then, Dan would have been

38:33.127 --> 38:35.372
the same reprehensible person he’s become.

38:36.643 --> 38:39.268
And you still would have been there for Lucas and me.

38:39.376 --> 38:44.681
And what for? So I could end up pushing 40’s still living in a bachelor apartment?

38:46.360 --> 38:47.486
Don’t you see, Karen?

38:49.123 --> 38:52.157
You got what you needed and so did Lucas.

38:53.130 --> 38:54.338
But what about me?

38:55.506 --> 38:56.677
I never said this before.

38:58.234 --> 38:59.355
But I will now.

39:00.988 --> 39:04.230
I stood by you, and I stood by Lucas,

39:05.914 --> 39:07.962
and I’m glad I did that. But...

39:09.696 --> 39:11.582
I just can’t help but think,

39:13.286 --> 39:16.942
why? What do I get out of it?

39:18.801 --> 39:20.900
You get a boy who loves you.

39:27.511 --> 39:31.386
- I’m sorry to interrupt but we need to talk.
- Okay, what’s up?

39:31.474 --> 39:34.729
Look, I know you did your best, mom.

39:38.006 --> 39:42.640
If you hadn’t kept Dan away, Keith and I probably wouldn’t have been so close.

39:45.596 --> 39:47.365
And I would have hated to miss that.

39:50.930 --> 39:54.753
So I understand now why you had to keep that secret to yourself.

39:56.086 --> 40:00.136
You just needed to find yourself on your own, right?

40:00.541 --> 40:01.261
Yes.

40:03.828 --> 40:05.281
Well that’s what I want, too.

40:07.862 --> 40:08.741
To start over.

40:11.204 --> 40:13.165
I mean, that’s what you did when you shut Dan out.

40:14.389 --> 40:16.320
That’s what you’re doing by leaving town.

40:17.073 --> 40:18.255
What do you mean, start over?

40:18.920 --> 40:20.088
I mean get away.

40:21.235 --> 40:24.777
Away from Dan. Away from this place.

40:26.815 --> 40:29.002
And away from all the mistakes I’ve been making.

40:36.244 --> 40:39.357
I want to go with Keith, mom.

40:45.202 --> 40:47.481
I want to leave Tree Hill.

40:48.305 --> 40:54.343
