The Guy: The sativas
go pretty quickly...

00:10.025 --> 00:12.275
...so I'm gonna give you
a little Green Crack

00:12.275 --> 00:14.317
and put that
in the back of the case,

00:14.317 --> 00:15.692
uh, right by the cookies.

00:15.692 --> 00:16.900
Abdullah:
Crack in the back.

00:16.900 --> 00:19.734
The Guy:
And I'm out
of sativa cartridges,

00:19.734 --> 00:21.942
so I have these hybrids,

00:21.942 --> 00:23.484
but it's Sunday,
so I think it's okay.

00:23.484 --> 00:24.983
I don't think
it'll be too crazy.

00:24.983 --> 00:28.067
It should be fine.
Also, I was thinking
it might be easier

00:28.067 --> 00:30.692
if I just pull up,
call them,

00:30.692 --> 00:32.942
and then they come down,
hop in the whip,

00:32.942 --> 00:34.234
and we drive
around the block.

00:35.317 --> 00:37.484
I mean, that seems
a little out in the open.

00:37.484 --> 00:38.858
I don't know.
I'm not worried about it.

00:38.858 --> 00:40.234
Everybody else
does it like that.

00:40.234 --> 00:42.359
But then you miss
the insides of the apartment,

00:42.359 --> 00:44.942
which is, like,
kind of the best part.

00:44.942 --> 00:46.567
I just think
it's gonna be faster, man.

00:46.567 --> 00:48.025
Yeah, yeah,
you're probably right.

00:48.025 --> 00:50.484
We can do that, yeah.
Abdullah: Cool.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.942
Um, I rolled you
some Js man.

00:52.942 --> 00:54.692
Figured with the arm
and everything...

00:54.692 --> 00:57.359
That is so nice.
Thank you so much.

00:57.359 --> 01:00.150
I really--
How could I leave you
high and dry, man?

01:00.150 --> 01:02.192
Look at you.
You'll just leave me high.

01:02.192 --> 01:04.651
Indeed.

01:04.651 --> 01:07.067

01:11.275 --> 01:12.734

01:12.734 --> 01:14.900
Got it.
You're the boss.
All right.

01:16.567 --> 01:20.025

got all that.

01:20.025 --> 01:22.150

01:26.359 --> 01:27.942

in the cookies?

01:27.942 --> 01:30.567
No, there are no nuts
in the cookies.

01:30.567 --> 01:32.400
You are
so conscientious, man.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.025
I know. I've literally
never known anyone
with a nut allergy,

01:35.025 --> 01:36.942
and I still freak out
about it all the time.

01:36.942 --> 01:38.900
It's gonna
come in handy one day.

01:38.900 --> 01:40.526

I'm gonna head out.

01:40.526 --> 01:42.983
