00:01.268 --> 00:03.335
(soft music plays)

00:33.100 --> 00:35.667
(light music)

00:36.070 --> 00:38.537
- [Raffy] I'm pretty sure
it was Nostradamus who said

00:38.539 --> 00:41.407
the most massive
stars in the universe

00:41.409 --> 00:43.042
have the shortest lives.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.714
Just look at the "27 Club".

00:48.716 --> 00:51.150
A bunch of famous people
with shitloads of money,

00:51.152 --> 00:53.852
leads to boredom,
leads to temptation,

00:53.854 --> 00:55.988
leads to shitty decisions,

00:55.990 --> 00:58.023
leads to total self-destruction.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.960
You're not a slave to need

01:01.962 --> 01:05.097
or to God, fuck
else is there to do?

01:06.333 --> 01:08.033
Become a slave to
something else.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.703
If you know what owns you
and you and you ignore it,

01:11.705 --> 01:13.539
life's pretty crappy.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.340
But if you know what
owns you and you let it,

01:15.342 --> 01:18.010
then life's fucking awesome.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.846
Especially in Hollywood.

01:23.484 --> 01:26.151
(upbeat music)

01:41.936 --> 01:44.203
- [Reporter] Freeze over
in the winter, either.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.172
Swimming is one of Hollywood's
main forms of exer-

01:47.174 --> 01:48.707
- So yesterday, right,

01:48.709 --> 01:50.209
I buy this pack of
natural chewing gum

01:50.211 --> 01:52.578
and the packaging has these
big bright letters on it

01:52.580 --> 01:54.580
that say "Bright Green".

01:54.582 --> 01:57.850
And all I could think
of was bright green.

01:57.852 --> 01:59.284
Like the words were
just forced upon me

01:59.286 --> 02:00.619
like I have no other choice

02:00.621 --> 02:02.121
but to fall to
the mercy of them.

02:02.123 --> 02:04.990
And I realized, that's how
my script needs to read.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.425
Bright fucking green!

02:06.427 --> 02:08.293
- [Woman] Evan, you're an actor.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.628
You're not a writer.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.562
- What?

02:10.564 --> 02:11.263
- [Woman] We're letting you go.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.364
- Wait.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.398
What, why?

02:14.435 --> 02:15.667
Is it because I
wouldn't cut my hair?

02:15.669 --> 02:17.603
Because if it's 'cause
I wouldn't cut my hair,

02:17.605 --> 02:19.304
I could cut my hair if
that's what you prefer.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.707
- [Woman] Listen, your projects
aren't going to happen.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.709
You're not the leading man
that we thought you were.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.043
- I don't understand,
what did I do?

02:25.045 --> 02:26.512
- [Woman] Every audition
you've gone in on,

02:26.514 --> 02:27.646
you fucked up.

02:27.648 --> 02:28.981
Your feedback has been terrible.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.582
- Because I've been
writing the script,

02:30.584 --> 02:32.818
I've been finishing the script.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.419
- [Woman] We represent
you as an actor,

02:34.421 --> 02:35.687
not as a screenwriter.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.356
- Well maybe you could
represent me as both

02:37.358 --> 02:41.193
because, I was literally
just about to send it to you.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.394
- [Woman] Is it finished?

02:42.396 --> 02:44.997
- Um yeah, it's closed
to being finished.

02:44.999 --> 02:47.833
It's almost finished.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.067
- [Woman] Goodbye, Evan.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.702
- Wait, look, I
just got to Raffy's.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.137
We're making final
touches today.

02:52.139 --> 02:54.173
- [Woman] Look,
it's just the business.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.208
Nothing personal.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.409
- Please don't do this.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.711
This is all I have.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.114
- [Woman] I'm sorry.

03:02.116 --> 03:04.616
- But I'd be co-starring
opposite Raffy Rivers.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.551
His name could get it made.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.019
We could shoot it this year.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.353
- [Woman] You send
me a completed script

03:08.355 --> 03:12.057
with the Raffy Rivers
actually committed,

03:12.059 --> 03:14.826
and maybe I will think about it.

03:14.828 --> 03:15.928
- Okay.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.796
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.464
You won't regret it.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.266
I will have the script
to you tomorrow morning.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.868
- Uh huh.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.835
Goodbye, Evan.

03:27.908 --> 03:31.510
- 138, 139, 140, 150, 160.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.416
How does that feel?

03:39.086 --> 03:40.752
Can you feel your own mortality?

03:41.755 --> 03:43.622
How does that feel, dumbfuck?

03:44.525 --> 03:45.791
Piece of a, piece of a,

03:47.061 --> 03:49.661
how does that feel,
you piece of a fuck?

03:49.663 --> 03:52.564
Can you taste your
own mortality?

03:53.467 --> 03:56.435
(doorbell ringing)

04:04.111 --> 04:07.079
(doorbell ringing)

04:19.059 --> 04:20.826
Evian, mazel tov,

04:20.828 --> 04:22.327
what's popping, baby?
- Hey man, how was it?

04:22.329 --> 04:24.429
- Man you know, just happy
to be back to be honest.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.331
- Well that ding dong
chime thing's new, huh?

04:26.333 --> 04:27.566
- Fucking stalkers, had to, man.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.134
- Yeah fuck, what was
her calling card again?

04:29.136 --> 04:30.102
You looked good today?

04:30.104 --> 04:31.036
- You smell good today.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.638
That's some weird shit, man.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.072
Yo my therapist said,

04:34.074 --> 04:36.074
all it is is just bad people
looking for attention.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.209
So fuck 'em.

04:37.211 --> 04:38.010
- Do you think
whoever it is sees it

04:38.012 --> 04:39.177
like Romeo and Juliet?

04:39.179 --> 04:40.212
Like some weird
fucked up love story?

04:40.214 --> 04:41.680
- Yo, Leo was good in that shit.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.348
But I don't know about
the Romeo and Juliet shit.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.117
But I'm used to strangers
falling in love with me.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.952
It's the weird
fucking letters that,

04:46.954 --> 04:47.786
- Yeah.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.720
- I can't get with it.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.188
What's up with your eyes, man?

04:50.190 --> 04:51.356
You've been crying?

04:51.358 --> 04:52.658
You've been bitching
up on me, hmm?

04:52.660 --> 04:53.892
- No, no.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.060
I put eye drops in.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.863
- Oh, you've been
getting high without me.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.031
You motherfucker.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.499
- No, I came from the gym.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.433
I had dry eyes.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.768
- Ooh, speaking of the gym.

05:02.770 --> 05:05.304
Today is a juice day.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.572
- Juice day, but it's Halloween.

05:07.574 --> 05:08.774
- Fuck Halloween.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.509
Man, all the refined
sugar and shit.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.444
Give you man titties,
you don't want that.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.546
Woo, I see you.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.747
Don't even worry about it.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.182
There's no nuts in
that, you'll be fine.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.450
There's chlorophyll in this shit

05:18.452 --> 05:19.951
supposed to get rid
of all the mercury.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.387
You know, I shit sashimi,
so this perfect for me.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.722
- Well in Fukusheema too.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.091
- Mmm, fuck all the shimis.

05:26.093 --> 05:26.925
Bottoms up.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.393
- Bottoms up.

05:28.395 --> 05:29.328
(thunder booming)

05:29.330 --> 05:31.663
Why would you do this to me!?

05:31.665 --> 05:32.731
I loved you!

05:34.768 --> 05:37.736
I fucking loved you
and you fucked with me.

05:37.738 --> 05:38.904
- I didn't fuck with you.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.207
It's all in your head.

05:44.078 --> 05:45.744
It's not real.

05:45.746 --> 05:46.945
- Of course it's real!

05:46.947 --> 05:48.280
Every little thing
you do is real

05:48.282 --> 05:50.449
and it has a consequence!

05:51.885 --> 05:54.353
You can't manipulate the wo--

05:54.355 --> 05:57.356
you can't manipulate the world.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.190
- Commit!

05:58.192 --> 05:59.091
Fucking commit!

06:00.761 --> 06:01.727
- Ahh, no, I can't.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.261
It doesn't feel real.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.831
- How real you
need, it felt good.

06:05.833 --> 06:06.665
- No, it feels fake.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.433
Can you turn that off?

06:08.435 --> 06:09.835
- Sora, next track.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.103
(beeping)

06:11.105 --> 06:12.371
- It's our second
act turning point.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.872
I mean everything in
our character's life

06:13.874 --> 06:14.940
is supposed to fall apart here.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.908
We're being too conservative.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.176
It should feel
impossible that he'll

06:18.178 --> 06:19.544
ever piece his life
back together again.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.613
- Shit, you always do this shit.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.814
- Do what?

06:22.816 --> 06:24.082
- Right when we're
on to something cool,

06:24.084 --> 06:26.118
you perfect the shit out of it

06:26.120 --> 06:27.119
till it's not cool anymore.

06:27.121 --> 06:28.387
You wipe it till it bleeds.

06:28.389 --> 06:29.988
- Yeah I just want
it to be perfect.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.057
I want it to be
Black Swan perfect.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.128
Uh, no.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.362
I'm focusing.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.231
- See, that's your
problem right there.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.699
All this umming and ahhing shit.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.200
That's what makes you week.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.203
Hey how the fuck you want
me to commit to your script

06:45.205 --> 06:46.905
when you won't even
commit to finishing

06:46.907 --> 06:48.173
the fucking thing?

06:48.175 --> 06:51.476
You gotta commit to
your choices, Evan.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.845
Be impulsive,
that's what men do.

06:55.349 --> 06:57.082
No matter who you are
or who you're playing,

06:57.084 --> 06:59.785
make a defined fucking choice.

06:59.787 --> 07:00.652
Shit.

07:02.356 --> 07:04.089
Throw a hammer at your problems.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.057
- I commit to my choices.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.192
- Yeah right.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.363
Then why have we been
going back and forth

07:11.365 --> 07:12.898
for two years on this script?

07:12.900 --> 07:15.333
- It's because I haven't
gotten it right yet.

07:15.335 --> 07:16.601
It's not right yet.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.070
- What happened to
"Bro, help me out.

07:19.072 --> 07:22.574
"You know, it'll be quick, nice
little creative adventure."

07:22.576 --> 07:24.476
- Creative exploration
is what I actually...

07:24.478 --> 07:26.611
- Man we could have finished
this shit months ago.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.879
We don't even have a title!

07:27.881 --> 07:29.214
- Untitled Hollywood
Hills Project.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.016
- That's a shit title.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.285
This is your first
writing project.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.386
Get your shit together!

07:34.388 --> 07:35.287
- Okay.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.356
All right, I'm gonna
get some of this weed.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.858
All right, let's do this.

07:41.628 --> 07:42.461
- Come on, hit that shit.

07:42.463 --> 07:43.962
Take a big hit, commit!

07:47.468 --> 07:48.733
There it is.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.168
- So our hero needs
to be more of a man.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.404
Animalistic but fearful.

07:52.406 --> 07:53.905
- That's what I'm talking about.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.540
So what's he gonna do?

07:56.777 --> 07:58.443
He gonna stay, gonna fight?

07:59.446 --> 08:00.946
Gonna do nothing?

08:00.948 --> 08:03.849
- Well my family's never
been eaten by zombies.

08:03.851 --> 08:07.252
My world isn't closing in on me.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.921
I mean when was the last
time you were truly afraid?

08:10.991 --> 08:12.057
Like to the core?

08:13.627 --> 08:17.362
- Last night, my Uber
driver ran a red light.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.763
- What did you do?

08:18.765 --> 08:20.432
- I gave that motherfucker
a two star rating!

08:22.402 --> 08:24.069
(chuckling)

08:24.071 --> 08:25.737
- If we've never felt true fear,

08:27.975 --> 08:29.941
true animalistic fear,

08:32.646 --> 08:34.713
how the fuck can we
be writing about it?

08:38.886 --> 08:39.985
We finish it tonight.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.623
And there's no nuts in this.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.557
How low is the dosage?

08:45.559 --> 08:46.825
It's a low dosage of weed?

08:46.827 --> 08:48.426
- Low, low as it go.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.295
- I know, these
weed edibles make me

08:50.297 --> 08:52.797
fucking paranoid
sometimes, you know?

08:52.799 --> 08:54.132
- Am I a friend
or am I a friend?

08:54.134 --> 08:55.567
I wouldn't give you no bullshit.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.069
It's like elementary
school shit.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.572
El gato, chakalate.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.741
- So it's light, it's
light, it's just,

09:02.743 --> 09:04.009
- Light, light.
- Okay, okay.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.544
- Light is Michael
Jackson's asshole.

09:05.546 --> 09:06.912
- Oh my god.

09:08.682 --> 09:09.581
- Mmm.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.517
Los gatos chakalate!

09:13.720 --> 09:15.186
- Okay.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.088
What's something
scary we can do now?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.026
- I always wanted
to jump off the roof

09:21.028 --> 09:22.494
into the pool.

09:22.496 --> 09:25.363
(chill R&B music)

09:28.201 --> 09:29.634
- Crazy to think how
many people there are

09:29.636 --> 09:30.602
in this city, huh?

09:31.738 --> 09:34.005
- (sighing) They're
all competition.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.108
- [Evan] The womb
of pop culture.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.610
Hey, what's with your shoes?

09:38.612 --> 09:40.011
- [Raffy] My stylist, she
want me to break them in

09:40.013 --> 09:41.580
for this event tomorrow night.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.984
- I don't think the
edible's working for me.

09:47.554 --> 09:50.221
- Imagine if Spiderman
lived in L.A.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.892
No fucking buildings
to hide behind.

09:53.894 --> 09:57.095
Paparazzi everywhere
so no exclusive shots

09:57.097 --> 09:58.396
for the Daily Bugle.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.499
That motherfucker'd be dead

10:01.501 --> 10:03.602
and unemployed in a second.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.503
Spiderman!

10:09.276 --> 10:12.277
You actually just ate
shrooms, by the way.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.244
- Fuck you!

10:14.314 --> 10:15.780
(Raffy laughing)

10:15.782 --> 10:18.917
(splashing)

10:18.919 --> 10:21.886
(electronic music)

10:39.973 --> 10:40.972
- [Woman] We're letting you go.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.374
- What?

10:42.376 --> 10:43.975
- [Woman] It's just the
business, it's nothing personal.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.076
- [Evan] It's all I have, hello?

10:45.078 --> 10:45.910
- [Woman] Nothing personal.

10:45.912 --> 10:46.745
- Please don't do this.

10:46.747 --> 10:47.912
- Commit!

10:47.914 --> 10:48.813
- [Woman] You're
represented as an actor,

10:48.815 --> 10:50.248
not a screenwriter.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.050
- [Evan] We finish it
tonight, we finish it tonight,

10:52.052 --> 10:53.184
tonight, tonight, tonight.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.687
Why would you do this to me?!

10:55.689 --> 10:56.621
- It's all in your head.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.689
- [Evan] Animalistic.

10:57.691 --> 10:58.523
- It's not real!

10:58.525 --> 10:59.924
(snarling)

10:59.926 --> 11:01.226
- [Evan] We finish it
tonight, we finish it tonight.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.062
(Raffy laughing)

11:08.368 --> 11:09.768
(laughing)

11:09.770 --> 11:11.336
- You're fucked in
the fucking head.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.470
- Why, why?

11:12.472 --> 11:13.505
What'd I do, what'd I do?

11:13.507 --> 11:14.406
- Oh god.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.608
Why would you give?

11:16.610 --> 11:17.942
Why would you give me shrooms,

11:17.944 --> 11:19.811
I've never done shrooms
before, I've never,

11:19.813 --> 11:21.146
I don't wanna.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.414
- Embrace it, man.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.314
- [Evan] I don't want
this feeling, I don't.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.149
- Yes you do.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.383
You want this feeling.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.651
This is the shit we've
been talking about.

11:26.653 --> 11:27.886
Come on, describe it,
tell me what you see.

11:27.888 --> 11:31.056
- What the? (laughing)

11:31.058 --> 11:31.990
- What?

11:31.992 --> 11:33.124
- What did you do to your hair?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.092
- You like it?

11:34.094 --> 11:35.393
- [Evan] I fuck, I love it.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.462
- Yeah, Red Dragon, bitch.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.296
- Dude, whoah.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.131
- Blondes have more fun.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.366
- [Evan] It really
works for you.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.802
Do you think madness
drives ambition

11:43.804 --> 11:45.036
or ambition drives us mad?

11:45.038 --> 11:45.937
- You're saying some good shit.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.372
We should write it down.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.241
No, no, you know
what we should do?

11:50.243 --> 11:52.210
You wanna fill the
pool with olive oil?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.045
- Yes.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.982
(trickling)

12:20.240 --> 12:21.840
- [Radio Host] Happy
Halloween, Angelenos,

12:21.842 --> 12:24.109
that was the feature track
from Huntley Thomas's

12:24.111 --> 12:25.977
latest film "The Rising".

12:25.979 --> 12:28.580
In traffic, the 101
is at a standstill.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.683
The culprit of the traffic,
reportedly trick or treaters

12:31.685 --> 12:33.351
dressed as a pack of coyotes.

12:34.321 --> 12:37.288
(light rock music)

12:38.258 --> 12:40.658
(trickling)

12:42.362 --> 12:44.629
- Hey would there be such
a thing as zombie coyotes,

12:44.631 --> 12:45.530
do you think?

12:47.234 --> 12:50.101
(crashing)

12:50.103 --> 12:51.736
Is that like breaking
a rule or something?

12:53.106 --> 12:58.109
'Cause we should definitely
have a moment like that.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.708
(thunder clapping)

13:30.710 --> 13:32.443
- [Voice] Psst,
finish it tonight.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.444
- Hello?

13:33.446 --> 13:34.412
Raffy?

13:47.727 --> 13:48.626
Hello?

13:49.930 --> 13:52.897
(doorbell ringing)

14:02.976 --> 14:04.542
- Yeah!

14:04.544 --> 14:05.443
Woo!

14:06.847 --> 14:08.813
That's what I'm talking about!

14:08.815 --> 14:10.615
Mission accomplished.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.718
(knocking)

14:13.720 --> 14:14.652
What?

14:14.654 --> 14:15.620
- Someone's in the house.

14:15.622 --> 14:16.688
- What?

14:16.690 --> 14:18.022
- Someone's in the house.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.624
- No one is in the house!

14:19.626 --> 14:20.792
- Someone's in the house.

14:20.794 --> 14:23.828
I heard the, I
heard a little girl

14:23.830 --> 14:25.730
and then I heard
the ding dong chime,

14:25.732 --> 14:26.631
the ding dong chime at the door.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.133
- You are paranoid, man.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.401
Just chill out.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.136
- Can you turn off
the music please?

14:32.138 --> 14:34.305
- Sora, music off.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.107
(doorbell ringing)

14:36.109 --> 14:37.008
The fuck?

14:38.678 --> 14:39.510
That shit is weird.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.445
- Let's call 911.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.846
- Give me this fucking phone.

14:41.848 --> 14:44.749
You ain't calling
fucking 911, you're high.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.050
You call the police
while you high?

14:46.052 --> 14:48.620
We'll be on TMZ by the morning!

14:48.622 --> 14:49.454
- Shit.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.090
All right, fuck.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.659
(tense music)

15:03.637 --> 15:05.169
- Hello?

15:05.171 --> 15:07.405
(snoring)

15:13.446 --> 15:16.014
(tense music)

15:22.589 --> 15:26.190
- [Evan] Probably just
trick or treaters.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.359
- That's why I got
a security gate.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.295
To keep the little
motherfuckers out!

15:35.769 --> 15:37.802
- Why do you keep a
hammer by the door?

15:38.905 --> 15:40.171
- 'Cause that's
what gangsters do.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.540
Sometimes I get scared.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.878
(rustling in distance)

15:46.880 --> 15:47.845
- Yeah I know I
should have just got

15:47.847 --> 15:48.980
a nine to five, yeah.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.349
But just wouldn't be--

15:51.351 --> 15:52.717
- Ah, piece of shit.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.489
(ominous music)

15:58.491 --> 16:02.827
- That pool light was
definitely on, right?

16:02.829 --> 16:04.062
Did you turn it off?

16:04.064 --> 16:05.163
Because I didn't turn it off.

16:09.803 --> 16:10.768
- The fuck?

16:11.805 --> 16:15.006
- Okay wait, we're on drugs.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.642
It's just a
hallucination, right?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.579
I mean we're on drugs,
it's a hallucination.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.148
(tense music)

16:30.457 --> 16:32.790
(laughing)

16:37.430 --> 16:38.196
It's your robe.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.735
It's just your fucking bathrobe.

16:46.072 --> 16:46.904
(creature growling)

16:46.906 --> 16:48.106
Whoah!

16:48.108 --> 16:49.407
(ominous music)
- What, wait, what?

16:51.378 --> 16:53.578
- Okay, something's
definitely out there.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.414
Something's
definitely out there.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.383
- Maybe that's what set
off the front sensor.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.956
Holy shit.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.601
They're everywhere now.

17:17.971 --> 17:21.039
(light piano music)

17:25.945 --> 17:28.179
(whining)

17:37.390 --> 17:38.289
- Wow.

17:41.895 --> 17:45.396
(helicopter whirring)

17:45.398 --> 17:46.330
(dance music)

17:46.332 --> 17:48.433
I mean that's the fucking hero.

17:48.435 --> 17:49.901
That's what we've been
trying to figure out.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.736
He just needs to listen
to his animal instinct.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.638
He needs to channel
his inner beast.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.874
I mean if there was actually
some stalker motherfucker

17:56.876 --> 17:58.242
in my friend's house right now,

17:58.244 --> 17:59.877
that whole fight
or flight thing.

18:05.385 --> 18:08.686
- [Robotic Voice] Front
door open, front door open.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.321
Front door open.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.291
(doorbell ringing)

18:14.928 --> 18:17.261
(thunking)

18:28.575 --> 18:29.474
- Oh my god.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.279
(laughing)

18:38.051 --> 18:40.885
- Man, you should see
your stupid ass face.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.620
Matter of fact, you know what,

18:42.622 --> 18:44.689
let me show it to
you right here.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.026
Look at that!

18:51.297 --> 18:53.664
That's Huntley, you idiot fuck!

18:55.568 --> 18:56.400
- What?

18:56.402 --> 18:58.336
- Our scary evening

18:58.338 --> 19:01.439
starring the Huntley Thomas.

19:01.441 --> 19:04.742
It's his best performance
yet. (clapping)

19:05.745 --> 19:07.111
- What are you talking about?

19:12.185 --> 19:13.985
- Hunt, come on
man, stop acting.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.486
I know you got all
the awards and shit

19:15.488 --> 19:16.654
but stop acting!

19:17.891 --> 19:18.890
- He's not acting.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.729
- Okay.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.398
He told you.

19:28.701 --> 19:29.734
- What the fuck are you talk,

19:30.870 --> 19:32.436
what the fuck are
you talking about?

19:36.709 --> 19:37.942
(laughing)

19:37.944 --> 19:41.746
- I called Huntely
over to fuck with us

19:41.748 --> 19:44.615
and obviously he told you

19:45.752 --> 19:47.952
'cause now you guys
are fucking with me.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.354
You can't fuck a fucker,
man, come on, Hunt!

19:54.160 --> 19:55.059
Huntley.

19:56.963 --> 19:57.929
- Oh, fuck.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.439
- Fuck!

20:09.943 --> 20:11.943
- I'm calling the cops.

20:11.945 --> 20:13.244
- You're not calling.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.179
Fuck, calling no fucking 911,

20:15.181 --> 20:16.914
you just killed Huntley Thomas!

20:19.018 --> 20:19.917
Oh shit.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.887
- Are you sure he's dead?

20:22.889 --> 20:25.356
- Check the
motherfucker's pulse.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.424
(retching)

20:26.426 --> 20:27.325
God damn!

20:29.062 --> 20:30.328
- I thought it was your fucking,

20:30.330 --> 20:31.662
I thought it was your stalker.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.364
I thought he was gonna come,

20:34.801 --> 20:36.300
I thought he was
your fucking stalker,

20:36.302 --> 20:37.401
I thought he was gonna
come back and murder you.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.903
- I called him over here!

20:38.905 --> 20:40.571
- Why did you do this to me?

20:40.573 --> 20:41.839
- I was trying to help you

20:41.841 --> 20:42.873
and you just killed
the motherfucker!

20:42.875 --> 20:45.009
- I did this for you!

20:45.011 --> 20:47.011
I thought I was
fucking protecting you!

20:56.322 --> 20:58.689
(chuckling)

21:00.460 --> 21:01.359
- This is it.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.367
It's that shit we
was talking about.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.837
That real deal true fear shit.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.975
- Oh my god.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.710
We're going to jail, man.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.145
- Nah.

21:21.147 --> 21:22.947
We're not going nowhere.

21:22.949 --> 21:23.848
- We're fucked.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.417
I'm calling the cops.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.954
- Oh come on, fuck calling
the cops, man, help me.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.291
Now quit acting like
a bitch, come on!

21:34.260 --> 21:35.159
- Oh shit.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.062
Oh my god.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.096
Fuck.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.365
Oh my god, oh my god.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.233
Jesus.

21:43.703 --> 21:44.935
Oh god.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.371
- Fuck, fuck the
motherfucker's heavy.

21:47.373 --> 21:52.410
(heels clacking)
(speaking in foreign language)

21:54.614 --> 21:56.047
- Ah shit.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.315
Oh my god.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.149
Okay.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.116
- Get it up.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.384
Come on man, my whites!

22:00.386 --> 22:01.719
- Dude, what the fuck,
it's a fucking couch!

22:01.721 --> 22:03.521
- This ball name, motherfucker!

22:03.523 --> 22:05.222
- [Robotic Voice]
Front door open.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.595
- Hey, baby.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.065
- How many times was it?

22:17.704 --> 22:20.538
How many times did you
fuck my writing partner?

22:20.540 --> 22:23.074
- Whatever it is that you
wanna talk to me about,

22:24.677 --> 22:26.077
let's talk about it outside.

22:26.079 --> 22:26.911
- Shut up!

22:26.913 --> 22:28.012
No, no, no, no, no, no!

22:28.915 --> 22:30.281
Google yourself.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.950
Come on, do it.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.421
Come on, check it.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.123
You're always on
fucking Twitter.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.131
It's all over the internet.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.736
- Who took this picture?

22:51.738 --> 22:53.971
- When you begged me to be
your girlfriend one month ago

22:53.973 --> 22:55.306
what was the thing I said?

22:56.476 --> 22:57.842
What was the one condition?

23:00.346 --> 23:02.780
I told you to fucking
never embarrass me.

23:05.351 --> 23:06.667
When was it?

23:06.668 --> 23:07.984
- I can't tell if
this is real or not.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.220
- Who's this?

23:09.222 --> 23:11.756
- This is Evan, Evan.

23:11.758 --> 23:12.656
- Hi.

23:14.427 --> 23:16.761
- We writing a thing together.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.763
- He's writing a thing with you?

23:18.765 --> 23:20.765
I'm writing a
thing with him too.

23:20.767 --> 23:21.999
He's writing a thing with you,

23:22.001 --> 23:23.968
I'm writing a thing with him.

23:23.970 --> 23:28.038
I guess everybody's fucking
writing a thing! (screaming)

23:28.040 --> 23:28.873
-Bitch. you drunk.

23:28.875 --> 23:29.707
(gun firing)

23:29.709 --> 23:30.808
- Idiot.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.109
- It was one time!

23:32.111 --> 23:34.011
Shit!
- Jesus, Jesus.

23:35.281 --> 23:36.414
-Man, pitch this shit!

23:36.416 --> 23:37.348
- What?

23:37.350 --> 23:38.416
- Pitch her the fucking script!

23:38.418 --> 23:39.917
Pitch it, pitch it!
- What?

23:39.919 --> 23:41.352
Uh, our script.

23:41.354 --> 23:43.154
We open on this eerie
pool at twilight,

23:43.156 --> 23:44.422
the time's a mystery.

23:44.424 --> 23:45.856
It could be morning,
it could be evening.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.425
And we push in slowly
to reveal something

23:47.427 --> 23:48.826
lying perfectly
still in the water.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.060
What is that?

23:50.062 --> 23:50.995
As we get closer,
we realize it's

23:50.997 --> 23:52.263
the body of a man, face down,

23:52.265 --> 23:53.631
surrounded by his own blood.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.232
Suddenly he starts
thrashing around

23:55.234 --> 23:57.101
morphing into a zombie

23:57.103 --> 23:59.537
because it's a
meaningful zombie movie.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.272
- That we want you to direct!

24:01.274 --> 24:02.106
- What?

24:02.108 --> 24:03.607
- What?

24:03.609 --> 24:04.508
- Yeah.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.244
We want you to direct.

24:07.246 --> 24:08.512
This is perfect for you.

24:10.817 --> 24:11.749
I was gonna tell you about this.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.284
- You expect me to believe that?

24:13.286 --> 24:14.585
- This is the reason
why I wanted you

24:14.587 --> 24:16.320
to move out to L.A.

24:16.322 --> 24:18.622
We just, we just haven't
finished the script yet

24:18.624 --> 24:19.857
but once we finish it, it's--

24:19.859 --> 24:22.326
- And you expect
me to believe you?

24:22.328 --> 24:24.328
- You know how talented
I think you are.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.499
Baby, just put down the gun.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.405
(sighing)

24:37.043 --> 24:37.875
(sniffling)

24:37.877 --> 24:39.176
I promise you.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.978
Now put down the gun.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.481
I know you're the director

24:43.483 --> 24:46.784
but let's go outside
and talk about it.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.857
(ominous music)

24:53.693 --> 24:54.592
Oh shit!

24:55.361 --> 24:56.360
(gun firing)

24:56.362 --> 24:57.962
- Ah!

24:57.964 --> 25:00.331
Shot me in the fucking foot!

25:01.501 --> 25:03.000
- No, no, no, no.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.003
(knocking)

25:06.005 --> 25:07.438
- Police!

25:07.440 --> 25:08.539
Open up!

25:08.541 --> 25:10.107
- You called the fucking police?

25:10.109 --> 25:13.711
- Fuck, when you butt dial
911, they still show up, right?

25:13.713 --> 25:15.179
My call must have connected.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.616
- Put her in the closet.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.850
- What?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.552
- You fucking heard me,
put her in the closet.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.387
- What about Huntley?

25:24.824 --> 25:27.892
(crickets chirping)

25:29.729 --> 25:32.630
- [Robotic Voice]
Front door open.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.633
- Is everything
okay in there, sir?

25:35.635 --> 25:37.968
- Ah man, everything's
great, yeah, yeah.

25:38.771 --> 25:40.304
- It's crazy, man.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.907
I could have sworn
I heard gunshots.

25:42.909 --> 25:43.841
- I heard those too.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.709
That's why I called you guys.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.945
Man, it's Halloween,
it was fireworks.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.814
You know the kids,
trick or treat.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.216
Trick, they got me.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.787
- You're Raffy Rivers.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.689
- (laughing) Guilty.

25:59.725 --> 26:00.724
- Look at your hair!

26:00.726 --> 26:03.027
- Yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.528
It's a little something
I'm working on.

26:04.530 --> 26:05.996
Well you know what, officer.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.399
I apologize sincerely.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.768
But thank you for your time.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.503
- What happened
to your foot, man?

26:18.210 --> 26:19.910
- A hammer.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.479
Tis but a scratch.

26:26.252 --> 26:33.057
- (whispers) Wink at me with
your right eye if something's
wrong.

26:40.433 --> 26:43.067
Holy shit, look at that city.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.372
Terrible view, am I right?

26:50.476 --> 26:51.508
Oh get out of here.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.545
You get out, that.

26:54.547 --> 26:56.647
All right I just gotta
tell you this, man.

26:56.649 --> 26:58.782
Your movie Arrested Affair

26:58.784 --> 27:02.186
just happens to be my favorite
fricking movie of all time.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.954
(laughing)

27:03.956 --> 27:04.788
- Man, thank you sir.

27:04.790 --> 27:05.923
- Sorry.

27:05.925 --> 27:08.459
(growling) I feel nervous.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.294
Do I look nervous?

27:10.296 --> 27:11.562
- Oh no, sir.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.866
Honestly I feel nervous.

27:20.539 --> 27:23.007
- Why would you feel nervous?

27:23.943 --> 27:25.843
- Because you're the police.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.047
And you're in my house.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.619
- I have to ask you something.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.790
Is that a chameleon?

27:41.060 --> 27:43.193
- [Raffy] That is a chameleon.

27:43.195 --> 27:44.094
- I dig it.

27:48.868 --> 27:52.136
It is a freak show out
there tonight, Raffy Rivers.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.038
I'll tell you that much.

28:00.146 --> 28:01.145
What do we have over here?

28:03.749 --> 28:05.449
What's happening over here?

28:05.451 --> 28:06.717
- Officer.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.320
- Sativa or Indigo,
what's your jam, man?

28:10.322 --> 28:13.057
- Oh, I've been
shitting nonstop.

28:14.093 --> 28:14.992
Juice cleanse.

28:19.131 --> 28:22.099
What's going on?

28:22.101 --> 28:22.966
What happened?

28:24.937 --> 28:25.836
- All right.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.338
Whose marijuana is this?

28:28.340 --> 28:29.807
- Oh, um.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.508
- Hey, get your fucking
hands where I can see them,

28:31.510 --> 28:32.342
both of you!

28:32.344 --> 28:33.811
- Shit, Jesus.

28:33.813 --> 28:36.413
I was literally just gonna
show you my weed card.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.282
I'm just gonna show
you my, it's medicinal.

28:38.284 --> 28:40.451
- Medicinal for what,
what are your symptoms?

28:40.453 --> 28:41.752
- Uh, okay.

28:42.988 --> 28:45.622
My symptoms are anxiety.

28:49.895 --> 28:53.297
Sleep disorder, I
can't sleep sometimes.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.131
- Incontinence?

28:54.133 --> 28:55.032
- What?

28:56.102 --> 28:58.602
(snickering)

29:02.174 --> 29:03.173
- I'm sorry, man.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.609
We live in California.

29:06.879 --> 29:08.245
I'm just messing with you.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.416
I feel like I'm in one
of your movies, man.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.486
Except my shit is real.

29:21.894 --> 29:22.993
I'm also an actor.

29:26.465 --> 29:27.297
- I see the talent.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.932
- Thank you.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.001
Thank you for saying that.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.203
- I can see it, I can
see the talent as well.

29:33.205 --> 29:37.307
- Both you guys, I think
we could play partners.

29:38.711 --> 29:42.146
Raffy Rivers, Officer Duane.

29:43.983 --> 29:46.917
- Just call me Raffy, you
don't have to say my full name.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.119
Just Raffy.

29:49.121 --> 29:49.953
- Really?

29:49.955 --> 29:51.455
- Really.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.190
- We're that cool?

29:53.192 --> 29:54.091
- My man.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.963
- Well, go ahead.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.133
Spark up, Raffy.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.335
Am I right?

30:05.337 --> 30:07.838
Ugh, don't mind
me, let's do this.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.173
- Okay.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.974
- Burn out!

30:10.976 --> 30:12.209
Light up!

30:12.211 --> 30:13.510
Flame on.

30:14.747 --> 30:18.315
I gotta tell you, just
chilling with the two of you's,

30:19.418 --> 30:23.520
on this couch, Halloween
night, pretty sweet.

30:23.522 --> 30:26.690
Make my list. (laughing)

30:28.027 --> 30:29.259
It's cool, what is that?

30:29.261 --> 30:30.360
It's a cool feeling.

30:37.603 --> 30:40.137
(tense music)

30:44.944 --> 30:45.809
Jesus!

30:47.780 --> 30:49.580
Get up, both of you.

30:49.582 --> 30:50.747
Whose blood is that?

30:52.218 --> 30:55.619
- It's um, you could
be in our film!

30:55.621 --> 30:56.620
- What?

30:56.622 --> 30:57.454
- What?

30:57.456 --> 30:58.288
- Yeah.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.523
The one we're writing.

30:59.525 --> 31:02.326
You could star opposite Raffy.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.261
- Not a fucking cake!
- Really?

31:04.263 --> 31:06.763
- Hey, you put the gun down

31:06.765 --> 31:08.265
you can star in any
fucking movie you want to.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.934
Matter of fact, we can even
figure something else out.

31:10.936 --> 31:11.835
- Huh?

31:12.638 --> 31:14.071
What you looking at?

31:14.073 --> 31:15.839
(crashing in distance)

31:15.841 --> 31:16.940
The fuck?

31:16.942 --> 31:18.275
Don't move!

31:18.277 --> 31:20.477
Don't you even fucking breathe!

31:20.479 --> 31:22.846
Ma'am, Ma'am I'm coming.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.185
Are you hurt?

31:28.187 --> 31:29.286
- No, no, no, no.
- Are you hysterical?

31:29.288 --> 31:30.320
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

31:30.322 --> 31:31.154
- What's going on here?

31:31.156 --> 31:32.022
- Nothing, nothing.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.557
Everything is fake here.

31:33.559 --> 31:36.326
It's Halloween, Happy Halloween.

31:36.328 --> 31:37.527
It's fake blood.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.796
I was just using it for
my Halloween costume

31:39.798 --> 31:42.332
and I just spilled
it everywhere.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.702
I was gonna clean it
before you noticed, sorry.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.704
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.140
Who are you?

31:50.142 --> 31:51.441
- Me?

31:51.443 --> 31:53.143
Oh, I'm the director.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.213
- Of what?

31:56.215 --> 31:58.181
- Of our film, our movie.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.484
- Look at me for a second.

32:02.988 --> 32:06.189
There's actually a part
you'd be like perfect for.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.291
- For the Sheriff?

32:07.293 --> 32:08.492
- [Jazz] Yeah.

32:08.494 --> 32:09.426
- Is that what
you were thinking?

32:09.428 --> 32:10.627
- Exactly, for the Sheriff.

32:10.629 --> 32:13.397
You've got that real
resonance to your voice.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.332
These boys they stop
maturing the second

32:15.334 --> 32:17.034
they moved to Hollywood, so.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.269
I gotta train them
to be men, you know.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.671
Age them up.

32:21.774 --> 32:25.409
- So uh, tell me about
this character, hmm.

32:25.411 --> 32:27.144
What are we talking
about, good guy, bad guy?

32:27.146 --> 32:29.680
- Yeah, he's the
noble man of the film.

32:29.682 --> 32:31.114
- The noble man.

32:31.116 --> 32:34.451
- Yeah he traps a herd of zombie
cattle ranchers in a barn.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.719
- He sets it ablaze.

32:35.721 --> 32:38.388
- But not before having
this tragic stare-off

32:38.390 --> 32:41.391
with his former wife
who's now a zombie.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.560
- He stares right down the lens

32:43.562 --> 32:45.562
right into her eyes

32:45.564 --> 32:47.664
hoping that she
still recognizes.

32:47.666 --> 32:48.632
- But it's too late?

32:48.634 --> 32:50.267
- [Duane] Oh shit.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.669
- The barn goes up in flames.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.907
(fire whooshing)

32:58.510 --> 33:02.512
- So he runs in after her

33:02.514 --> 33:07.050
convinced that all
of this is just one

33:07.052 --> 33:09.353
big old crappy mistake.

33:11.623 --> 33:13.657
- And then what fucking happens?

33:13.659 --> 33:16.326
- And then she bites his
face off and he dies.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.828
- Jesus.

33:17.830 --> 33:21.331
- But he does it all from a
place of love and compassion.

33:21.333 --> 33:24.267
- It has love, story.

33:24.269 --> 33:26.103
- I wanna shoot it
predominantly in white

33:26.105 --> 33:27.604
so you can get
that uncomfortable

33:27.606 --> 33:30.073
fly on the wall
feeling, you know?

33:34.713 --> 33:35.612
- Yeah.

33:37.016 --> 33:38.415
Shooting whites.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.486
(thunking)

33:42.488 --> 33:43.754
- Oh fuck.

33:43.756 --> 33:44.721
- Nobody move.

33:48.027 --> 33:48.859
Is that?

33:48.861 --> 33:49.693
(shattering)

33:49.695 --> 33:50.761
- [Raffy] Oh!

33:50.763 --> 33:53.196
- What the fuck, why would?

33:53.198 --> 33:54.965
What the fuck, why
would you do that?

33:54.967 --> 33:56.299
- You fucking kidding me?

33:56.301 --> 33:58.402
You guys tied me up and put me

33:58.404 --> 34:00.337
in a goddamn closet
next to a dead person.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.005
- You shot me in
the fucking foot!

34:02.007 --> 34:03.440
- Well you'd both be
in handcuffs right now

34:03.442 --> 34:04.307
if it wasn't for me.

34:04.309 --> 34:05.909
- Jesus.

34:05.911 --> 34:07.644
- I don't feel good.

34:07.646 --> 34:08.779
- You don't feel good?

34:08.781 --> 34:10.447
You know what, I'm sorry.

34:10.449 --> 34:11.281
- My stomach.

34:13.952 --> 34:14.801
- Fuck you!

34:14.802 --> 34:15.651
- We could even figure
some other shit out

34:15.654 --> 34:17.154
and looking down at
his fucking penis,

34:17.156 --> 34:18.555
what the fuck was that?

34:18.557 --> 34:21.258
- Anyone who says they
haven't sucked a dick

34:21.260 --> 34:23.226
to get ahead in
Hollywood is lying.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.628
- I haven't sucked any dick.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.129
- That's 'cause you're a girl.

34:26.131 --> 34:27.564
- [Jazz] Ew.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.366
(retching)

34:29.368 --> 34:31.101
- [Raffy] Are you gonna
make me do it too?

34:31.103 --> 34:32.135
- What's happening to him?

34:32.137 --> 34:33.904
- [Raffy] Ah shit, it's the,

34:33.906 --> 34:35.405
- [Jazz] What's happening?

34:35.407 --> 34:38.008
- Chocolate cats, it's the
high, he's coming down.

34:38.010 --> 34:40.010
- The come down?

34:40.012 --> 34:41.912
The fucking come down?

34:43.982 --> 34:45.415
This is why.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.017
(doorbell ringing)

34:47.019 --> 34:50.087
- [Raffy] It helps
for your nausea.

34:50.089 --> 34:52.255
If you can't come down,
you keep going up.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.193
- What is this?

34:56.195 --> 34:58.395
- It's a bag of dreams.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.730
The best strain of magic
mushroom known to man.

35:01.834 --> 35:03.567
- Can someone please
go get some rope?

35:04.636 --> 35:05.769
- Why the fuck
would I have rope?

35:05.771 --> 35:06.970
- [Jazz] Well I don't know,

35:06.972 --> 35:08.004
rope is an ordinary
household item.

35:08.006 --> 35:09.639
- Not in a black man's house.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.174
- Okay, I'll drug him
with these shrooms

35:11.176 --> 35:13.110
and then you can dump him
somewhere downtown later.

35:13.112 --> 35:14.978
- That, that's brilliant.

35:14.980 --> 35:18.148
Then he will think
that he never met me.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.417
This is all a dream.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.119
Like a Biggie lyric.

35:22.121 --> 35:23.320
- Can we just tie him up first

35:23.322 --> 35:24.888
before we shove poison
down his throat?

35:24.890 --> 35:27.457
I mean he could be
concussed, right?

35:27.459 --> 35:28.625
- That's your fucking
problem, Evan.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.061
You're always overthinking shit.

35:31.063 --> 35:32.262
- I didn't overthink!

35:32.264 --> 35:35.031
- Let me fucking
finish, Evan, okay?

35:35.033 --> 35:36.199
That's your fucking problem!

35:36.201 --> 35:38.335
You're always overthinking shit.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.769
It can be simple.

35:39.771 --> 35:42.105
That's why we'll never
fucking finish this script.

35:42.107 --> 35:44.441
That's why we're in
this situation we're in

35:44.443 --> 35:48.245
because your ass is
an over fucking--

35:48.247 --> 35:49.880
- I didn't overthink
throwing a hammer

35:49.882 --> 35:51.948
at who I thought was
your stalker, did I?

35:51.950 --> 35:53.750
- Why are you fucking
yelling at my house?!

35:53.752 --> 35:54.918
- Quiet now!

35:56.555 --> 35:57.787
I've done it, it's done.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.756
Now what the fuck are
you fighting about?

36:02.995 --> 36:06.229
(tense music)

36:06.231 --> 36:08.265
- He's fucking dead
because of you.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.166
- Dead?

36:10.169 --> 36:12.402
What's that word mean anymore?

36:12.404 --> 36:14.204
I envy the word.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.639
- You put us all at risk.

36:17.910 --> 36:20.243
You can't manipulate
the world around you.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.079
- Oh, I can.

36:24.449 --> 36:25.649
If you don't know that,

36:26.785 --> 36:28.118
then you're already dead.

36:36.128 --> 36:37.044
- No.

36:37.045 --> 36:37.961
It's not your second
act turning point.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.629
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

36:39.631 --> 36:40.630
It sounds fake, right?

36:40.632 --> 36:41.631
- [Jazz] Yup.

36:41.633 --> 36:42.432
- Yeah, it sounds fake.
- Yeah.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.767
- Okay.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.402
- I think it needs
more action, you know?

36:45.404 --> 36:48.004
Just because your characters
have been surrounded by death,

36:48.006 --> 36:50.640
it doesn't mean they're
not affected by it.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.108
No matter how heightened
your world is,

36:52.110 --> 36:54.444
mortality should
still be mortality.

36:54.446 --> 36:57.647
Try to let it manifest
in a fucked up way.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.749
- So yesterday, right?

36:59.751 --> 37:02.085
I buy this pack of
natural chewing gum.

37:02.087 --> 37:04.854
The packaging has
these big letters on it

37:04.856 --> 37:06.156
that say "Bright Green".

37:06.158 --> 37:07.390
And I had--

37:07.392 --> 37:08.792
- Until right now you
guys have never had

37:08.794 --> 37:11.962
anything bad happen to
you before, have you?

37:11.964 --> 37:13.430
- Well have you?

37:13.432 --> 37:14.664
- Maybe.

37:14.666 --> 37:17.367
- Look baby, I told
you I was sorry, shit.

37:17.369 --> 37:18.535
It's a fucked up--

37:18.537 --> 37:19.803
- No, I'm not talking
about you, ugh.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.871
It's not about you all
the time, oh my god.

37:24.142 --> 37:24.841
- I fucked up.

37:24.842 --> 37:25.541
- [Evan] Well now
you have to tell us.

37:25.544 --> 37:27.644
- Now I have to tell you?

37:27.646 --> 37:28.578
What do you think this is,

37:28.580 --> 37:30.046
the fucking Breakfast club?

37:30.048 --> 37:33.116
- Yeah I love that
fucking movie.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.451
- It is a good movie.

37:34.453 --> 37:35.685
- So are you gonna tell us?

37:35.687 --> 37:37.420
What happened to you?

37:38.423 --> 37:39.322
- Ugh.

37:46.565 --> 37:47.564
I was raped.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.504
I was uh,

37:55.907 --> 37:59.643
I was raped in uh, in college.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.818
(laughing)

38:12.224 --> 38:13.456
You know what,

38:13.458 --> 38:15.025
no, no, excuse me.

38:26.605 --> 38:30.073
You know the really, the
really weird part of it all

38:32.911 --> 38:33.810
is that,

38:37.115 --> 38:38.348
no one tells you that

38:41.086 --> 38:43.720
that when a man forces
himself inside of you,

38:47.526 --> 38:48.958
you don't always stay dry.

38:52.731 --> 38:56.232
Like some animalistic
part tries to,

38:57.336 --> 38:58.468
to make it work.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.707
His body wanted it and,

39:07.045 --> 39:08.244
mine welcomed it.

39:13.318 --> 39:14.851
We're just animals, I guess.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.721
Simple soulless animals.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.325
No one tells you that.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.863
(somber music)

39:26.865 --> 39:28.131
You see?

39:28.133 --> 39:29.799
That's exactly how uncomfortable

39:29.801 --> 39:32.402
this second act turning
point needs to feel

39:32.404 --> 39:34.504
it should feel awkward, weird.

39:34.506 --> 39:37.907
I mean it's the lowest
point in the script, right?

39:37.909 --> 39:41.177
- So that stuff didn't
really happen to you?

39:41.179 --> 39:44.447
- No, but it's a
good story, right?

39:44.449 --> 39:45.882
(laughing)

39:45.884 --> 39:48.418
Isn't it obvious what
needs to happen at the end?

39:48.420 --> 39:50.353
- No, that's what
we're sitting here

39:50.355 --> 39:51.888
trying to fucking figure out.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.657
- What?

39:54.659 --> 39:56.860
What's your idea on the ending?

39:56.862 --> 40:00.530
- I don't know guys, you gave
me your pitch to distract me,

40:00.532 --> 40:02.732
I'm not gonna tell you
anything unless I'm really in.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.001
- At this point, like what
does it even fucking matter?

40:05.003 --> 40:07.404
Yes, you're in.

40:07.406 --> 40:08.772
I mean, okay?

40:08.774 --> 40:09.939
- Yeah?

40:09.941 --> 40:10.840
- [Raffy] Yeah.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.013
- Okay.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.247
But no tricks, no
lies, just business.

40:19.484 --> 40:20.383
- Just business.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.653
- [Radio Host] Well it's
the witching hour, Angelenos

40:23.655 --> 40:26.456
and there's only one
minute left of Halloween.

40:26.458 --> 40:29.793
If you're not drunk by now or
you haven't been scared yet

40:29.795 --> 40:31.394
you probably should
check your pulse

40:31.396 --> 40:33.563
because you might
be dead already.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.365
- [Evan] And you're sure
nobody goes in here?

40:35.367 --> 40:37.734
- [Raffy] Not a soul,
I live next door.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.536
It's vacant land.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.805
- Are we really gonna let
this girl direct our movie?

40:41.807 --> 40:43.473
I mean how well do you know her?

40:44.943 --> 40:45.909
- A few months.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.177
She was living in New York,

40:47.179 --> 40:48.912
I convinced her
to move out here.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.413
She's brilliant, trust me.

40:50.415 --> 40:51.314
- She's insane.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.516
- Fucking insane.

40:53.518 --> 40:54.751
What great artist isn't?

40:55.787 --> 40:57.654
- Look at this shirt.

40:57.656 --> 40:58.621
- Huntley's so cool.

40:58.623 --> 41:00.290
- [Evan] Yeah he was so cool.

41:00.292 --> 41:03.326
- There's no was when it
comes to us actors, my friend.

41:03.328 --> 41:06.529
Just turn on the TV,
you'll see him again.

41:06.531 --> 41:09.799
Actors can never be killed.

41:09.801 --> 41:13.470
They're like frozen in
pop culture carbonite.

41:15.474 --> 41:18.174
I mean he's Huntley
fucking Thomas.

41:19.344 --> 41:20.410
Been around forever.

41:21.613 --> 41:23.112
You never really die.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.814
- [Evan] What if you die
before you're successful,

41:24.816 --> 41:26.149
what then?

41:26.151 --> 41:27.851
- The egg cracks on
the outside, life ends.

41:27.853 --> 41:31.254
It cracks from the
inside, life begins.

41:31.256 --> 41:32.622
Sometimes you gotta crack.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.259
- Did you come up with that?

41:36.261 --> 41:37.627
- I heard it in yoga once.

41:40.765 --> 41:42.031
- I like your shirt, man.

41:42.033 --> 41:43.333
It's fucking cool.

41:45.136 --> 41:47.704
I think the second round
of shrooms just kicked in.

41:51.443 --> 41:54.677
- Eh, take it.

41:54.679 --> 41:55.645
Take it man, it's shit.

41:55.647 --> 41:57.313
I see how you're looking at it.

41:59.518 --> 42:00.316
You know what?

42:01.520 --> 42:03.820
We'll let the
coyotes do the rest.

42:05.290 --> 42:08.291
- [Evan] Oh god, this is
really fucking disturbing.

42:08.293 --> 42:09.492
- [Raffy] Let's get
the fuck out of here.

42:09.494 --> 42:11.294
- [Evan] Wait, but.

42:11.296 --> 42:14.264
- [Raffy] At least he
made it into the 27 Club.

42:14.266 --> 42:15.431
- [Evan] How?

42:20.505 --> 42:22.605
(doorbell ringing)

42:22.607 --> 42:23.940
(light guitar music)

42:23.942 --> 42:26.843
- [Robotic Voice]
Front door open.

42:29.347 --> 42:30.179
- [Evan] Hey, did you
finish reading the script?

42:30.181 --> 42:31.447
What did you think?

42:31.449 --> 42:32.382
- [Jazz] Yeah, it's
actually pretty good

42:32.384 --> 42:33.449
but how do you want it to end?

42:33.451 --> 42:34.551
- He awake yet?

42:40.992 --> 42:42.425
God damn.

42:42.427 --> 42:44.093
You knocked him out pretty good.

42:46.698 --> 42:48.464
- God, his pulse is racing.

42:50.635 --> 42:53.202
- You weren't wearing
that shirt before.

42:53.204 --> 42:55.505
- He stole it from a corpse.

42:55.507 --> 42:56.372
- What?

42:56.374 --> 42:58.107
You fucking kidding me?

42:58.109 --> 42:59.976
It's fucking
evidence, take it off.

42:59.978 --> 43:01.811
You fucking carrot.

43:01.813 --> 43:02.679
- Fuck.

43:04.049 --> 43:06.549
I'm gonna wear, I'm wearing
one of your shirts, okay?

43:06.551 --> 43:07.917
- Hey look at that,
that fucking shirt,

43:07.919 --> 43:11.788
that's one of my
favorite fucking shirts.

43:11.790 --> 43:12.755
Where are my keys?

43:13.692 --> 43:14.524
I'll get the car.

43:14.526 --> 43:16.426
- No, you can't get the,

43:16.428 --> 43:18.227
it's Halloween, there's
people everywhere.

43:18.229 --> 43:19.495
- So what are we gonna do then?

43:19.497 --> 43:21.397
- We finish the scene.

43:21.399 --> 43:25.535
- The scene is finished,
it's fine, finished.

43:25.537 --> 43:28.037
- No, okay, so
they bury the body,

43:28.039 --> 43:30.106
we think it's fine,
and then what?

43:30.108 --> 43:31.507
It's gotta keep moving.

43:31.509 --> 43:34.077
- And they shit themselves
to death, the end.

43:34.079 --> 43:35.612
- Well I know what I'm doing.

43:37.816 --> 43:39.849
- What are you, wait?

43:39.851 --> 43:40.850
- I know you didn't.

43:40.852 --> 43:41.784
- What about this?

43:41.786 --> 43:43.519
- What the, walk off with my--

43:43.521 --> 43:45.455
- What about the scripts?

43:45.457 --> 43:47.156
- What about it?

43:47.158 --> 43:48.758
- Well we've only
got two scenes to go.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.526
- [Jazz] Yeah, and?

43:51.596 --> 43:53.663
- Can't we just breathe
for a second, shit.

43:53.665 --> 43:55.064
- Would the hero
really run the risk

43:55.066 --> 43:56.766
of burying him in the
middle of the night?

43:56.768 --> 43:59.168
I mean why not just chop
him up into little pieces?

43:59.170 --> 44:00.637
He still wouldn't
become a zombie.

44:00.639 --> 44:02.105
- You're overthinking it.

44:02.107 --> 44:03.306
- [Raffy] That's what he does.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.140
- No I don't.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.908
- Yes you do.

44:05.910 --> 44:07.710
- You know the one
thing that unifies

44:07.712 --> 44:09.078
everyone alive today?

44:09.080 --> 44:10.313
- [Raffy] What?

44:10.315 --> 44:13.316
- We'll all be dead eventually.

44:13.318 --> 44:14.217
Together.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.786
And every story that's
unfolding right now,

44:16.788 --> 44:20.323
one day there won't be a single
person alive to tell them.

44:20.325 --> 44:23.493
So it's our job to show future
generations how we live now.

44:24.863 --> 44:27.430
Which is probably
how we always lived

44:27.432 --> 44:28.665
and how we always will.

44:32.237 --> 44:33.336
- That was deep shit.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.240
- We'll have it
done by tomorrow.

44:37.242 --> 44:39.042
- We could be writing
it for another 10 years.

44:39.044 --> 44:41.210
I mean how do we even
know when it's done?

44:43.348 --> 44:46.416
- You'll hear
ringing in your ear.

44:49.988 --> 44:51.754
Whenever you finish
something big,

44:53.024 --> 44:54.791
you hear this
ringing in your ear.

44:55.760 --> 44:57.093
It's called the White Noise.

44:59.097 --> 45:00.029
- The White Noise?

45:04.035 --> 45:05.301
- Yeah.

45:05.303 --> 45:07.203
Most people never hear
it in their lifetime.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.372
- And you just hear this
everyday, I'm guessing.

45:12.644 --> 45:15.011
- Well you'd guess that, huh?

45:15.013 --> 45:16.245
But no, never.

45:19.284 --> 45:20.850
Never heard it.

45:20.852 --> 45:23.152
Just heard about it.

45:23.154 --> 45:24.053
Maybe one day.

45:24.989 --> 45:27.290
(coughing)

45:29.894 --> 45:32.328
- Anyway, it's been a
strange night, guys.

45:32.330 --> 45:34.731
Inspiration only comes
when the body's relaxed.

45:36.334 --> 45:37.600
So let's relax.

45:40.171 --> 45:41.104
- Let's relax, right.

45:41.106 --> 45:42.505
How are we supposed to do that?

45:45.643 --> 45:46.709
- Sex helps me.

45:53.284 --> 45:54.851
- So does dancing.

45:56.988 --> 45:58.654
Ever heard of dance cardio?

45:58.656 --> 45:59.689
That's where we met.

46:00.725 --> 46:03.292
(funky music)

46:14.172 --> 46:16.472
¶ Inside your head ¶

46:16.474 --> 46:20.810
¶ Late at night watching
these films that feel bare ¶

46:20.812 --> 46:25.081
¶ Lost your mind and when
you sit back stare and ¶

46:25.083 --> 46:29.452
¶ Stopped rewinded
for you that ¶

46:29.454 --> 46:34.524
¶ Is it all inside ¶

46:36.461 --> 46:39.762
¶ My mind, oh no ¶

46:39.764 --> 46:44.000
¶ Could it just be ¶

46:44.002 --> 46:48.104
¶ Half of them to be ¶

46:48.106 --> 46:53.176
¶ 'cause I wanna look
as you lose your mind ¶

46:54.145 --> 46:57.547
¶ Someone within the line ¶

46:57.549 --> 47:01.184
¶ Just you there who
tears me a time ¶

47:01.186 --> 47:06.022
¶ I'm sure you'll be fine ¶

47:06.024 --> 47:10.660
¶ Did you leave it
back with yesterday ¶

47:10.662 --> 47:14.897
¶ Or maybe you lost
it all this way ¶

47:14.899 --> 47:17.633
¶ Don't be so silly boy ¶

47:17.635 --> 47:19.168
¶ It's right here ¶

47:19.170 --> 47:21.938
¶ You're the state ¶

47:21.940 --> 47:24.874
- Ah, um, I should,

47:24.876 --> 47:25.908
I should get back to writing.

47:25.910 --> 47:28.077
- No, no, stay here.

47:30.315 --> 47:32.148
Come on, let me
teach you to dance.

47:34.352 --> 47:37.086
- Look, I'm not, no,
I'm not a good dancer.

47:37.088 --> 47:38.321
- [Jazz] Wrong, I'm sure
you're a good dancer.

47:38.323 --> 47:39.856
- [Evan] No, I'm bad.

47:39.858 --> 47:41.424
Really bad.

47:41.426 --> 47:43.759
I'm not coordinated at all.

47:46.030 --> 47:47.797
- Jazz, what the fuck, come on,

47:47.799 --> 47:49.198
what are you doing?

47:49.200 --> 47:50.800
- Okay, I'm no.

47:50.802 --> 47:52.301
Come on, you guys need help.

47:52.303 --> 47:54.036
I'm not getting in
the way of this shit.

47:54.038 --> 47:54.937
- No.

47:56.574 --> 47:57.773
- The man wants
to go, let him go.

47:57.775 --> 47:59.408
- No, he wants to stay with me.

48:00.578 --> 48:01.944
It's not your business.

48:06.351 --> 48:07.650
¶ You looked all right ¶

48:07.652 --> 48:12.021
¶ Now when I look at
you and I say how ¶

48:12.023 --> 48:13.222
¶ Do you do ¶

48:13.224 --> 48:14.223
(doorbell ringing)

48:14.225 --> 48:15.958
¶ That's what she says ¶

48:15.960 --> 48:18.661
¶ Are you gonna be my man ¶

48:18.663 --> 48:19.896
(tense music)

48:19.898 --> 48:21.697
- You took these fucking
pictures, didn't you?

48:21.699 --> 48:22.832
- You really think
I'd stand there

48:22.834 --> 48:24.100
and watch you fuck someone else?

48:24.102 --> 48:25.301
- [Raffy] Then who the
fuck took them then?

48:25.303 --> 48:27.169
- I don't know, anyone.

48:27.171 --> 48:29.105
Can you please stop it now!

48:30.675 --> 48:32.241
Fuck you!

48:32.243 --> 48:33.576
- They're inside!

48:33.578 --> 48:34.977
- What?

48:34.979 --> 48:36.445
- Whoever took these pictures
were inside the house.

48:36.447 --> 48:37.647
- [Jazz] The stalker.

48:37.649 --> 48:39.081
- [Evan] What if they're
watching right now?

48:39.083 --> 48:41.350
- That means they seen all this.

48:41.352 --> 48:42.251
Everything!

48:43.054 --> 48:44.353
Fuck!

48:46.124 --> 48:48.691
(tense music)

48:54.332 --> 48:55.598
- [Jazz] What the fuck?

48:55.600 --> 48:58.634
- It's my autopilot
surveillance drone.

49:00.571 --> 49:02.171
It's attracted to
movement and heat.

49:02.173 --> 49:04.540
I'ma set it to scan and
recharge every 30 minutes.

49:04.542 --> 49:05.708
- What does that mean?

49:05.710 --> 49:07.443
- I mean it
automatically recharges

49:07.445 --> 49:08.477
and watches over the house.

49:08.479 --> 49:09.946
Streams straight to my phone.

49:09.948 --> 49:10.780
- Okay, no, no, no, come on.

49:10.782 --> 49:11.814
This is fucking insane.

49:11.816 --> 49:13.516
We have to call the cops.

49:13.518 --> 49:15.017
- It's not a fucking
option, Evan.

49:15.019 --> 49:16.686
- Someone broke into your house.

49:18.089 --> 49:19.956
We killed someone tonight,
I killed someone tonight.

49:19.958 --> 49:21.490
- Accidentally.

49:21.492 --> 49:23.059
- Yeah so we call the cops
and explain that to them.

49:23.061 --> 49:25.728
We're not these people.

49:27.098 --> 49:29.832
We could explain to them
that it was self-defense.

49:29.834 --> 49:32.134
That's what we explain to
them, it was self-defense.

49:32.136 --> 49:33.369
- So you're just gonna call

49:33.371 --> 49:34.603
and tell them that
you hit somebody

49:34.605 --> 49:36.305
in the back of the head
with a fucking hammer?

49:36.307 --> 49:37.540
It looks premeditated!

49:37.542 --> 49:38.808
- Shh.

49:38.810 --> 49:39.742
- And then what are we
supposed to tell them

49:39.744 --> 49:41.210
about the cop in the closet?

49:41.212 --> 49:42.712
- We're not gonna be able
to tell them anything

49:42.714 --> 49:44.513
if this fucking psycho got
photos from tonight, are we?

49:45.616 --> 49:47.817
Jesus, we killed Huntley Thomas.

49:47.819 --> 49:50.252
- Hey listen, Huntley
isn't a zombie, okay?

49:50.254 --> 49:51.487
He's still gonna
be dead tomorrow.

49:51.489 --> 49:52.521
He's gonna be dead next week

49:52.523 --> 49:53.723
and the week after.

49:53.725 --> 49:55.825
We're creating
something now, okay?

49:55.827 --> 49:57.626
Something amazing and meaningful

49:57.628 --> 49:59.395
which is so much
more important than

49:59.397 --> 50:01.664
one actor's life, by the way.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.299
And you're about to finish.

50:03.301 --> 50:05.668
You're about to finish tonight.

50:05.670 --> 50:07.837
So turn yourselves in
tomorrow if you have to,

50:07.839 --> 50:09.205
just don't do it tonight.

50:09.207 --> 50:10.506
- Why are you helping us?

50:11.943 --> 50:13.376
Huh, why are you here?

50:13.378 --> 50:16.946
You could have had us
arrested, you could have left.

50:16.948 --> 50:18.381
- And ruin an opportunity?

50:19.684 --> 50:21.183
Wouldn't have much
of a movie to direct

50:21.185 --> 50:22.385
without the movie star.

50:24.655 --> 50:25.554
Or the writer.

50:28.226 --> 50:30.526
- Look, this is how Huntley
Thomas would have wanted it.

50:30.528 --> 50:32.695
This creation, our movie.

50:32.697 --> 50:35.297
They're gonna talk about
this for a hundred years.

50:35.299 --> 50:37.700
This is pop culture
like a motherfucker!

50:37.702 --> 50:39.502
Come on, even Officer Duane.

50:39.504 --> 50:40.770
He's gonna be in on it too.

50:40.772 --> 50:42.538
We're all gonna be
fucking legends.

50:44.342 --> 50:45.574
I'ma go check the gate code,

50:45.576 --> 50:46.809
switch all that shit
up, lock everything up.

50:46.811 --> 50:48.344
You guys go check out
the secret garden.

50:48.346 --> 50:50.946
He comes back, we gonna be
ready for that motherfucker.

50:51.916 --> 50:52.782
- Shit.

51:02.927 --> 51:04.827
- Drug him and dump
him somewhere downtown.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.467
So where's the perfect
place to hide a body?

51:28.052 --> 51:30.753
(whirring)

51:30.755 --> 51:32.288
Why are you friends with him?

51:35.359 --> 51:36.826
- Why am I friends with him?

51:37.662 --> 51:38.761
Why did you date him?

51:40.164 --> 51:42.832
- I don't know, I guess he
makes things adventurous.

51:42.834 --> 51:44.066
- He does.

51:44.068 --> 51:46.001
- I met him on my
first day in New York.

51:46.003 --> 51:46.802
- [Evan] No way.

51:46.804 --> 51:48.104
- Yup.

51:48.106 --> 51:49.672
- I met him on my
first day in L.A.

51:49.674 --> 51:51.207
- Wait, really?

51:51.209 --> 51:54.143
- Yeah, I was an extra on this
movie that he was shooting.

51:54.145 --> 51:56.145
He rescued me from
this insane producer

51:56.147 --> 51:57.546
who was yelling at me for eating

51:57.548 --> 52:00.082
before the casting crew, and um,

52:02.620 --> 52:04.053
it was fucking amazing.

52:04.055 --> 52:07.323
Just this movie star
sticking up for a nobody.

52:08.426 --> 52:09.925
- You're too smart
to be a nobody.

52:14.365 --> 52:15.464
- You don't need him.

52:17.869 --> 52:18.968
You know that, right?

52:22.807 --> 52:23.706
- Do you?

52:28.913 --> 52:30.646
- You need to leave.

52:32.116 --> 52:34.917
Don't tell Raffy, but
I'm calling the cops.

52:38.556 --> 52:39.622
We're not murderers.

52:40.825 --> 52:44.393
Just, I'm calling
them this time.

52:44.395 --> 52:45.427
I can't do this.

53:03.581 --> 53:05.814
(beeping)

53:15.026 --> 53:17.860
- [Ghostly Voice] I'm
here for you, Raffy.

53:17.862 --> 53:18.761
Raffy.

53:20.231 --> 53:21.964
Raffy Rivers.

53:21.966 --> 53:23.532
- Leave me alone.

53:23.534 --> 53:24.934
Leave me the fuck alone.

53:25.836 --> 53:27.903
I don't wanna be famous no more.

53:27.905 --> 53:29.338
Leave me alone.

53:29.340 --> 53:30.706
- [Man] The fuck you
looking at, let's go.

53:30.708 --> 53:34.777
- [Woman] Oh shit, where
the fuck is this party?

53:35.980 --> 53:38.514
(sighing)

53:38.516 --> 53:41.083
(light music)

54:14.719 --> 54:17.353
- [Evan] Did you see something?

54:20.224 --> 54:21.123
- No, you?

54:24.595 --> 54:25.494
- No.

54:32.203 --> 54:33.102
You okay?

54:36.440 --> 54:37.339
Raffy?

54:39.176 --> 54:41.844
- I'm supposed to be
turning 28 next year.

54:45.816 --> 54:48.550
I used to count these every day.

54:50.187 --> 54:51.820
I thought I'd be better by now.

54:53.758 --> 54:55.024
Have more control.

54:57.495 --> 55:00.963
You know, making shit
that I actually wanna do.

55:03.367 --> 55:04.767
I actually cared about.

55:06.470 --> 55:08.070
I ain't been offered anything.

55:09.507 --> 55:10.639
Not one fucking offer

55:12.243 --> 55:14.076
since Underwater Sinners tanked.

55:14.845 --> 55:16.545
- You're Raffy Rivers.

55:16.547 --> 55:17.713
You're a movie star.

55:17.715 --> 55:19.581
One bad film isn't
gonna kill your career.

55:20.718 --> 55:24.586
- I guess Raffy Rivers
is all washed up.

55:26.957 --> 55:28.123
- That was a good pun.

55:29.894 --> 55:32.594
Raffy Rivers, all washed up.

55:32.596 --> 55:33.495
- I know.

55:36.734 --> 55:39.601
Look, man, you're
the real artist.

55:40.871 --> 55:43.772
You're the talented one.

55:43.774 --> 55:45.040
- Me, no.

55:45.042 --> 55:46.108
No I'm not, you are.

55:49.013 --> 55:51.513
- This movie, our movie,

55:53.451 --> 55:54.583
we need to finish it.

55:55.786 --> 55:57.853
This shit could be amazing.

55:59.590 --> 56:00.656
I believe that.

56:02.193 --> 56:04.293
Shit, you gotta believe.

56:04.295 --> 56:06.261
You gotta believe
it could be amazing.

56:08.432 --> 56:09.932
- My acting agent dropped me.

56:13.337 --> 56:14.236
- When?

56:15.773 --> 56:16.672
- This morning.

56:18.476 --> 56:19.041
I didn't tell you, so.

56:22.646 --> 56:24.880
I have no idea what I'm doing.

56:24.882 --> 56:27.116
- You're writing, I'm
directing and he's starring.

56:27.118 --> 56:28.617
That's what we're doing.

56:30.321 --> 56:32.955
(somber music)

56:37.728 --> 56:38.694
- Fuck 'em!

56:45.336 --> 56:46.201
Fuck 'em!

56:47.037 --> 56:48.604
Fuck 'em!

56:48.606 --> 56:49.905
Come on!

56:49.907 --> 56:51.807
Fuck these motherfuckers!

56:51.809 --> 56:53.008
- Fuck 'em.

56:53.010 --> 56:54.143
- [Raffy] Fuck 'em.

56:54.145 --> 56:55.844
- Fuck 'em.

56:55.846 --> 56:57.379
- [Raffy] Fuck 'em.

56:57.381 --> 56:58.647
- Fuck 'em.

56:58.649 --> 56:59.615
- Fuck 'em!

56:59.617 --> 57:00.449
Woo!

57:01.585 --> 57:02.684
- Fuck 'em!

57:02.686 --> 57:04.319
(hooting)

57:04.321 --> 57:05.587
Fuck Harvey!

57:05.589 --> 57:07.823
(howling)

57:09.226 --> 57:12.194
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

57:13.297 --> 57:15.464
Every movie I did, we
could do that shit!

57:15.466 --> 57:19.234
(hooting and howling)

57:19.236 --> 57:21.804
(tense music)

57:55.506 --> 57:57.806
- (laughing) Your
burning ambition?

57:57.808 --> 58:00.042
Ah, so you remember.

58:00.044 --> 58:01.143
- Come on.

58:01.145 --> 58:02.044
- Ah.

58:03.147 --> 58:04.680
- [Raffy] I truly
believe in you.

58:04.682 --> 58:05.948
- [Jazz] No, stop it.

58:05.950 --> 58:07.416
- [Raffy] You get
an opportunity.

58:07.418 --> 58:08.684
- [Jazz] Please, what
are you talking about.

58:08.686 --> 58:11.353
- Isn't everyone preying
on everyone's ambition?

58:11.355 --> 58:13.689
(laughing)

58:20.097 --> 58:20.996
Ready?

58:23.067 --> 58:24.933
- Yeah, yeah.

58:26.303 --> 58:27.503
He's dead.

58:27.505 --> 58:30.072
He's dead because of you.

58:30.074 --> 58:30.973
- Dead?

58:32.109 --> 58:33.575
What does that mean anymore?

58:34.512 --> 58:35.611
I mean--

58:35.613 --> 58:36.645
- Stop, stop, stop.

58:38.182 --> 58:39.414
Can you try it all again,

58:39.416 --> 58:41.416
but without any dialogue?

58:41.418 --> 58:42.584
- [Raffy] Why?

58:42.586 --> 58:43.852
- Why not?

58:43.854 --> 58:45.454
- No, why don't we just
switch the words around?

58:45.456 --> 58:46.922
We'll just change
the line when he,

58:46.924 --> 58:47.956
- No, no, no.
- It's the weird part

58:47.958 --> 58:48.790
where he goes into the--

58:48.792 --> 58:49.224
- No words.

58:52.696 --> 58:54.129
- [Evan] No words, okay.

58:54.131 --> 58:56.231
- You're having
fun with this, huh?

58:56.233 --> 58:57.833
- Just connect with each other.

58:59.436 --> 59:00.602
Do it.

59:00.604 --> 59:05.674
- Okay, action.

59:18.155 --> 59:21.390
(lightly tense music)

59:36.574 --> 59:38.807
(choking)

59:45.749 --> 59:46.715
- Oops.

59:47.618 --> 59:49.184
Guess that one had nuts in it.

59:51.121 --> 59:53.855
- What's happening,
what's wrong with him?

59:53.857 --> 59:55.390
You okay?

59:55.392 --> 59:56.525
- Damn, E.

59:57.928 --> 59:59.428
You look terrified.

59:59.430 --> 1:00:01.663
You should probably take a
selfie, where's your phone?

1:00:01.665 --> 1:00:02.564
Oh that's right.

1:00:04.668 --> 1:00:06.134
- I told you to take his phone.

1:00:06.136 --> 1:00:07.636
I didn't tell you to kill him.

1:00:07.638 --> 1:00:09.104
- He's fine.

1:00:09.106 --> 1:00:10.739
He's just allergic to nuts.

1:00:10.741 --> 1:00:13.909
You understand why we
couldn't call the cops, right?

1:00:13.911 --> 1:00:16.945
It would ruin everything
that we've worked for.

1:00:16.947 --> 1:00:18.213
You don't wanna do that.

1:00:20.117 --> 1:00:21.550
You should see this
as an opportunity.

1:00:21.552 --> 1:00:24.186
I mean, you're right
there on death's doorstep

1:00:24.188 --> 1:00:25.821
but you have a magical
adrenaline shot

1:00:25.823 --> 1:00:27.723
that fixes everything instantly.

1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:32.661
It's like an antidote
to your kryptonite.

1:00:35.232 --> 1:00:37.199
- [Jazz] Okay, well
what do we do now?

1:00:37.201 --> 1:00:39.301
- You just relax!

1:00:39.303 --> 1:00:41.103
- No, we have to help him,
he's fucking dying right now.

1:00:41.105 --> 1:00:42.571
- He's not dying!

1:00:42.573 --> 1:00:44.172
- Yes he is, look!

1:00:44.174 --> 1:00:45.440
- He has six minutes of life.

1:00:45.442 --> 1:00:48.543
Well, five minutes
and 30 seconds.

1:00:50.581 --> 1:00:51.980
Relax.

1:00:51.982 --> 1:00:53.649
I'm giving him inspiration.

1:00:53.651 --> 1:00:55.517
How many people can
say that they walked

1:00:55.519 --> 1:00:59.488
through the gates of
hell and survived.

1:00:59.490 --> 1:01:03.191
How does it feel to
taste your own mortality?

1:01:09.433 --> 1:01:11.633
Man, it's a special moment.

1:01:11.635 --> 1:01:12.567
It's a gift.

1:01:13.504 --> 1:01:14.703
- You're crazy.

1:01:14.705 --> 1:01:16.538
- When you're on
your real deathbed,

1:01:16.540 --> 1:01:17.539
you'll look back at this moment,

1:01:17.541 --> 1:01:19.274
and it won't be so scary.

1:01:21.645 --> 1:01:22.544
All right.

1:01:23.547 --> 1:01:25.013
Where's the adrenaline shot?

1:01:25.916 --> 1:01:27.382
- [Jazz] Where is it?

1:01:27.384 --> 1:01:30.018
You have an adrenaline?
- It should be his clothes.

1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:31.053
- Where is it?

1:01:31.055 --> 1:01:33.055
- Jacket, jacket.

1:01:33.057 --> 1:01:34.356
- Jacket, jacket!

1:01:34.358 --> 1:01:35.190
- [Jazz] Okay, where's
it, where's your,

1:01:35.192 --> 1:01:36.324
where's his jacket?

1:01:36.326 --> 1:01:37.359
- I don't fucking know!

1:01:37.361 --> 1:01:39.928
Hey Evan, where's your jacket?

1:01:43.767 --> 1:01:44.866
Huh?

1:01:44.868 --> 1:01:46.201
Huntley, shit!

1:01:50.207 --> 1:01:51.073
Ah!

1:01:52.042 --> 1:01:54.576
(tense music)

1:02:08.492 --> 1:02:11.359
- [Duane] Come on, come on.

1:02:11.361 --> 1:02:13.595
(huffing)

1:02:16.734 --> 1:02:18.967
(gasping)

1:02:31.448 --> 1:02:32.948
- Kssh!

1:02:32.950 --> 1:02:33.849
Get off!

1:02:35.586 --> 1:02:36.485
Fuck!

1:02:48.165 --> 1:02:50.966
(drone whirring)

1:03:20.864 --> 1:03:23.598
(intense music)

1:03:27.538 --> 1:03:29.871
(groaning)

1:03:33.877 --> 1:03:36.278
(screaming)

1:03:47.624 --> 1:03:49.925
(grunting)

1:03:52.996 --> 1:03:53.895
I got it!

1:03:55.332 --> 1:03:56.264
Take his pants off!

1:03:56.266 --> 1:03:58.133
It goes in his leg!

1:03:59.503 --> 1:04:02.103
The coyotes are falling for
the bait, so we're good!

1:04:03.106 --> 1:04:06.107
(thunder rumbling)

1:04:10.347 --> 1:04:11.246
Evan?

1:04:12.449 --> 1:04:13.381
Sora, off.

1:04:15.819 --> 1:04:16.718
Sora, off!

1:04:20.257 --> 1:04:21.156
Yo!

1:04:28.599 --> 1:04:29.497
You win.

1:04:30.968 --> 1:04:31.933
You got me.

1:04:33.570 --> 1:04:35.537
You scared the shit
out of me, man.

1:04:35.539 --> 1:04:37.172
Thought I almost killed you.

1:04:37.174 --> 1:04:40.175
(doorbell ringing)

1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:44.579
Hello?

1:04:47.317 --> 1:04:50.218
- [Robotic Voice]
Front door open.

1:04:51.221 --> 1:04:53.722
(shattering)

1:05:01.098 --> 1:05:03.398
(gasping)

1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:05.267
- [Evan] Madness
drives ambition.

1:05:05.269 --> 1:05:06.835
- [Jazz] How many times was it?

1:05:06.837 --> 1:05:09.905
- Whoever took these pictures
were inside the house!

1:05:09.907 --> 1:05:11.339
Who took this picture?

1:05:15.479 --> 1:05:17.779
(coughing)

1:05:22.252 --> 1:05:23.151
The fuck?

1:05:23.954 --> 1:05:25.220
How did you even fucking--

1:05:25.222 --> 1:05:27.722
- I always keep an extra
one of these in my car.

1:05:27.724 --> 1:05:31.059
But thank you for
bringing this back.

1:05:31.061 --> 1:05:32.527
These things are
fucking expensive.

1:05:32.529 --> 1:05:34.296
- The fuck out of here.

1:05:37.768 --> 1:05:39.434
What's this?

1:05:39.436 --> 1:05:40.335
- It's your turn.

1:05:41.772 --> 1:05:43.872
Russian Roulette,
classic and old school.

1:05:51.815 --> 1:05:54.416
- You know how I know
this shit isn't loaded,

1:05:54.418 --> 1:05:57.419
'cause you're too
pussy for that.

1:05:57.421 --> 1:05:59.154
Too much of a fucking pussy.

1:06:00.257 --> 1:06:02.190
- Then why do you have
it aimed at my head?

1:06:03.560 --> 1:06:05.794
Just put it to your head
and pull the trigger once.

1:06:05.796 --> 1:06:07.062
Got a one in six chance.

1:06:08.832 --> 1:06:11.399
- Who came up with this
little shitty cliche, hmm?

1:06:13.203 --> 1:06:14.102
You or him?

1:06:15.105 --> 1:06:16.037
- Are you scared?

1:06:19.376 --> 1:06:20.775
This moment's a gift, bro.

1:06:23.246 --> 1:06:25.013
Can you taste your
own mortality?

1:06:26.917 --> 1:06:28.650
- I don't feel shit.

1:06:28.652 --> 1:06:30.185
- Oh yeah?

1:06:30.187 --> 1:06:31.286
How about now?

1:06:39.997 --> 1:06:42.530
I think you wanted me to
kill Huntley on purpose.

1:06:43.934 --> 1:06:45.567
One less actor to compete with.

1:06:46.370 --> 1:06:48.670
(laughing)

1:06:51.008 --> 1:06:53.475
- You, you, think this script

1:06:55.912 --> 1:06:57.512
is gonna change something, huh?

1:06:58.615 --> 1:07:00.915
It's gonna fucking
change your life, huh?

1:07:00.917 --> 1:07:02.484
You're gonna be some
big fucking movie star

1:07:02.486 --> 1:07:03.551
after this bullshit?

1:07:06.289 --> 1:07:07.889
Come on, Evan!

1:07:07.891 --> 1:07:10.825
My fucking agent would
never let me co star

1:07:11.728 --> 1:07:14.896
in a movie with you. (laughing)

1:07:17.300 --> 1:07:20.068
If they were gonna hire you,
who would they call, huh?

1:07:22.606 --> 1:07:26.775
You are a unemployed
actor in Los Angeles

1:07:28.045 --> 1:07:30.245
with no fucking money

1:07:31.782 --> 1:07:32.881
and no agent.

1:07:35.485 --> 1:07:38.019
(laughing)

1:07:38.021 --> 1:07:41.523
- You pull that trigger on me
and I will fucking kill you.

1:07:41.525 --> 1:07:43.892
- You know how I know
this shit is not loaded?

1:07:45.729 --> 1:07:47.195
Because you fucking need me.

1:07:48.398 --> 1:07:49.631
Both of you.

1:07:49.633 --> 1:07:51.399
You ain't shit without me.

1:07:51.401 --> 1:07:53.735
(clicking)

1:07:53.737 --> 1:07:56.071
(laughing)

1:07:57.841 --> 1:07:59.074
- I loved you.

1:08:01.912 --> 1:08:04.312
I loved you and
you fucked with me.

1:08:08.085 --> 1:08:10.418
(laughing)

1:08:12.989 --> 1:08:13.855
- Told you.

1:08:15.826 --> 1:08:17.692
I'm a entity to you.

1:08:20.163 --> 1:08:22.030
Got me tied up in
this fucking chair

1:08:22.966 --> 1:08:24.132
and I still hold all the cards.

1:08:27.604 --> 1:08:32.073
Raffy Rivers. (laughing)

1:08:32.075 --> 1:08:33.141
Who are you?

1:08:34.211 --> 1:08:35.110
A nobody.

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:38.746
Fucking pathetic.

1:08:40.217 --> 1:08:41.049
(bashing)

1:08:41.051 --> 1:08:42.050
Fuck are you doing?!

1:08:42.052 --> 1:08:44.452
(splashing)

1:08:45.856 --> 1:08:48.423
(tense music)

1:09:53.190 --> 1:09:55.290
(gasping)

1:09:55.292 --> 1:09:56.191
Ah, fuck!

1:09:59.062 --> 1:10:03.064
You've had the knife
behind you the whole time?

1:10:06.236 --> 1:10:07.101
Fuck, ah!

1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:12.607
It was all pretend!

1:10:12.609 --> 1:10:14.242
- [Evan] It was.

1:10:14.244 --> 1:10:15.143
- No, no!

1:10:16.980 --> 1:10:20.181
All of this, I set it
up, it was all pretend.

1:10:20.183 --> 1:10:21.516
- What?

1:10:21.518 --> 1:10:24.285
- I had the agents call
you and let you go.

1:10:26.189 --> 1:10:27.088
- Why?

1:10:28.391 --> 1:10:29.257
- I thought it was the
firecracker that you needed

1:10:29.259 --> 1:10:31.292
to finish this script.

1:10:34.864 --> 1:10:37.732
(laughing)

1:10:37.734 --> 1:10:39.734
- So I have an agent?

1:10:39.736 --> 1:10:42.770
- Yes, yes, you got
a fucking agent.

1:10:44.908 --> 1:10:47.709
- [Evan] And Huntley,
he's still alive?

1:10:47.711 --> 1:10:50.311
- [Raffy] Nah, he's still dead.

1:10:50.313 --> 1:10:51.179
- And...

1:10:54.417 --> 1:10:55.283
Scene.

1:11:00.624 --> 1:11:01.789
You guys.

1:11:03.226 --> 1:11:04.125
It's crazy.

1:11:06.162 --> 1:11:07.895
You can pretty much do
anything you want in this town

1:11:07.897 --> 1:11:09.664
if you have a good
enough costume.

1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:18.239
Someone smells good today.

1:11:20.744 --> 1:11:22.343
(tense music)

1:11:22.345 --> 1:11:24.279
- [Raffy] It's fucking him.

1:11:24.281 --> 1:11:25.179
- Who?

1:11:26.449 --> 1:11:27.448
- The stalker.

1:11:27.450 --> 1:11:28.349
- No.

1:11:29.519 --> 1:11:30.451
No, no, no, no.

1:11:30.453 --> 1:11:33.955
The whole world is your stalker.

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:38.893
I just take the photos, man.

1:11:41.965 --> 1:11:42.864
It was uh,

1:11:44.267 --> 1:11:46.334
it was a lot of fun watching you

1:11:46.336 --> 1:11:51.372
fuck that shorty while you were

1:11:52.075 --> 1:11:52.807
wherever you were.

1:11:54.511 --> 1:11:56.678
She has much bigger
titties than you.

1:11:56.680 --> 1:11:58.346
- All right man,
that's fucking enough!

1:11:58.348 --> 1:12:02.617
- Did you know that they gave
me 45 grand for that shot?

1:12:02.619 --> 1:12:07.422
45 thousand dollars!

1:12:10.060 --> 1:12:11.726
It's my masterpiece.

1:12:11.728 --> 1:12:14.729
- That's why you've been
fucking with me, huh?

1:12:14.731 --> 1:12:17.398
45, that's why you've
been fucking with me?

1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:20.168
- The crazier you
get, the richer I get.

1:12:22.038 --> 1:12:24.305
Sorry bro, it's just business.

1:12:26.443 --> 1:12:28.176
And I knew the shit
was gonna hit the fan

1:12:28.178 --> 1:12:30.044
when you came home and found out

1:12:30.046 --> 1:12:34.982
he was cocksawing
through everything.

1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:39.287
So I came back to
get that killer shot.

1:12:40.790 --> 1:12:43.224
I didn't expect to
find three killers.

1:12:43.226 --> 1:12:45.560
- [Robotic Voice]
Front door open.

1:12:45.562 --> 1:12:46.961
Front door open.

1:12:49.065 --> 1:12:51.132
- [Huntley] What the?

1:12:51.134 --> 1:12:53.468
- [Raffy] Fuck calling
the cops, man, help me.

1:12:54.504 --> 1:12:56.104
- You know, he'd
probably still be alive

1:12:56.106 --> 1:12:57.839
if he hadn't seen
me hiding there.

1:13:00.043 --> 1:13:02.510
Winning. (laughing)

1:13:03.747 --> 1:13:04.812
- I like your shirt.

1:13:05.749 --> 1:13:06.914
- [Duane] What?

1:13:06.916 --> 1:13:08.483
- Your shirt,
where'd you get it?

1:13:10.653 --> 1:13:11.986
- This isn't mine.

1:13:13.356 --> 1:13:15.556
- It's that drone
recording everything?

1:13:15.558 --> 1:13:17.091
- [Raffy] And it
streams to my phone.

1:13:18.461 --> 1:13:19.627
- How are you feeling?

1:13:20.964 --> 1:13:23.297
Lugging Huntley's body
into the block next door.

1:13:23.299 --> 1:13:24.198
- What?

1:13:25.435 --> 1:13:26.601
What are you saying?

1:13:26.603 --> 1:13:27.969
- You must be exhausted.

1:13:28.905 --> 1:13:30.471
- No.

1:13:30.473 --> 1:13:31.839
No, no, no, no.

1:13:31.841 --> 1:13:33.641
Nice try, you stupid bitch.

1:13:33.643 --> 1:13:34.942
I didn't kill anybody.

1:13:34.944 --> 1:13:36.110
- Well it sucks that
your fingerprints

1:13:36.112 --> 1:13:37.378
are on the gun though.

1:13:39.716 --> 1:13:42.950
You should apologize
for shooting Raffy
Rivers in the foot.

1:13:42.952 --> 1:13:44.719
- No!

1:13:44.721 --> 1:13:46.387
No, fuck you.

1:13:46.389 --> 1:13:48.723
- Especially while
impersonating a police officer.

1:13:48.725 --> 1:13:49.957
- Stop it.

1:13:49.959 --> 1:13:52.026
Stop moving, stop moving!

1:13:52.862 --> 1:13:55.196
(retching)

1:13:56.966 --> 1:13:59.634
(intense music)

1:14:07.143 --> 1:14:08.643
(gun firing)

1:14:08.645 --> 1:14:09.544
- E!

1:14:11.381 --> 1:14:12.680
- Fuck you all!

1:14:12.682 --> 1:14:13.514
Fuck you!

1:14:13.516 --> 1:14:15.750
(moaning)

1:14:22.692 --> 1:14:25.359
(somber music)

1:14:29.899 --> 1:14:31.299
- I can hear it.

1:14:32.402 --> 1:14:35.036
The White Noise, I can hear it.

1:14:42.512 --> 1:14:44.412
The hero needs to die.

1:14:46.850 --> 1:14:48.149
That's the end.

1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:52.520
- You actually loaded it.

1:14:54.023 --> 1:14:55.623
- It was loaded the whole time.

1:14:57.494 --> 1:15:01.896
- I thought it was the
firecracker you needed.

1:15:01.898 --> 1:15:03.130
I can hear it.

1:15:04.434 --> 1:15:05.533
I can hear.

1:15:05.535 --> 1:15:07.935
(splashing)

1:15:16.379 --> 1:15:18.513
- We're gonna need
another writer.

1:15:20.216 --> 1:15:21.182
(Duane retching)

1:15:21.184 --> 1:15:24.886
¶ I had one look last summer ¶

1:15:24.888 --> 1:15:28.556
¶ That won everyday ¶

1:15:28.558 --> 1:15:33.628
¶ The day the beach
was so crowded ¶

1:15:34.464 --> 1:15:37.265
¶ When she passed my way ¶

1:15:37.267 --> 1:15:42.336
¶ She thought that
I looked so lonely ¶

1:15:43.673 --> 1:15:44.839
- [Evan] I'm pretty sure
it was Nostradamus who said

1:15:44.841 --> 1:15:46.607
the most massive
stars in the universe

1:15:46.609 --> 1:15:47.909
have the shortest lives.

1:15:49.546 --> 1:15:50.878
Just look at the 27 Club.

1:15:52.015 --> 1:15:54.115
A bunch of famous people
with shitloads of money

1:15:54.117 --> 1:15:56.651
leads to boredom,
leads to temptation,

1:15:56.653 --> 1:15:58.319
leads to shitty decisions,

1:15:58.321 --> 1:16:00.121
leads to total self-destruction.

1:16:02.392 --> 1:16:05.026
When you're not a slave
to need or to God,

1:16:05.028 --> 1:16:06.794
what the fuck else
is there to do?

1:16:08.464 --> 1:16:10.264
Become a slave to
something else.

1:16:12.969 --> 1:16:15.269
If you know what owns
you and you ignore it,

1:16:16.139 --> 1:16:17.505
then life's pretty crappy.

1:16:18.641 --> 1:16:21.442
And if you know what
owns you and you let it,

1:16:21.444 --> 1:16:22.643
life's fucking awesome.

1:16:24.247 --> 1:16:26.380
Especially in Hollywood.

1:16:31.054 --> 1:16:33.821
¶ On that summer day ¶

1:16:33.823 --> 1:16:36.457
¶ Lucky day ¶

1:16:36.459 --> 1:16:40.595
¶ That set my life awhirl ¶

1:16:40.597 --> 1:16:45.199
¶ Now that summer's here again ¶

1:16:45.201 --> 1:16:49.804
¶ Will you still be my girl ¶

1:16:49.806 --> 1:16:52.239
¶ Summer day ¶

1:16:52.241 --> 1:16:54.675
¶ Lucky day ¶

1:16:54.677 --> 1:16:57.912
¶ Summer's here again ¶

1:17:05.622 --> 1:17:08.623
(electronic music)

1:17:21.671 --> 1:17:26.741
¶ We couldn't find the
pieces to this puzzle ¶

1:17:31.514 --> 1:17:35.383
¶ I've got good eyes
from all these things ¶

1:17:35.385 --> 1:17:37.952
¶ That don't fit together ¶

1:17:37.954 --> 1:17:42.757
¶ One another and more ¶

1:17:42.759 --> 1:17:47.828
¶ Days go by ¶

1:17:49.632 --> 1:17:53.300
¶ And yet I'm still trying ¶

1:18:01.077 --> 1:18:04.612
¶ I feel like an animal ¶

1:18:04.614 --> 1:18:09.684
¶ Ready to fly ¶

1:18:11.087 --> 1:18:15.089
¶ But I'm stuck inside of
these questions in my mind ¶

1:18:19.996 --> 1:18:24.098
¶ Just look around
you so you remember ¶

1:18:24.100 --> 1:18:26.434
¶ All that I gave you ¶

1:18:26.436 --> 1:18:28.669
¶ But you still want more ¶

1:18:28.671 --> 1:18:30.938
¶ Just let me hold you ¶

1:18:30.940 --> 1:18:36.010
¶ Fill this void in your heart ¶

1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:40.214
¶ Well take a deep breath ¶

1:18:40.216 --> 1:18:42.583
¶ It won't be long this ¶

1:18:42.585 --> 1:18:44.819
¶ There's nothing great here ¶

1:18:44.821 --> 1:18:46.954
¶ Or come with thunder ¶

1:18:46.956 --> 1:18:48.989
¶ True love awaits ¶

1:18:48.991 --> 1:18:53.227
¶ Don't throw it
around your head ¶

1:19:32.702 --> 1:19:37.772
¶ Let's go take the
pieces of our puzzles ¶

1:19:41.544 --> 1:19:43.778
¶ Throw them off the cliff ¶

1:19:43.780 --> 1:19:45.913
¶ And follow after ¶

1:19:45.915 --> 1:19:50.985
¶ 'cause everything
will come together ¶

1:19:51.821 --> 1:19:56.090
¶ And every step I take ¶

1:19:59.796 --> 1:20:04.865
¶ Is another day ¶

1:20:09.605 --> 1:20:11.472
¶ Just look around you ¶

1:20:11.474 --> 1:20:13.941
¶ So you remember ¶

1:20:13.943 --> 1:20:16.377
¶ All that I gave you ¶

1:20:16.379 --> 1:20:18.512
¶ But you still want more ¶

1:20:18.514 --> 1:20:20.748
¶ Just let me hold you ¶

1:20:20.750 --> 1:20:25.820
¶ Through this war
in your heart ¶

1:20:27.623 --> 1:20:29.957
¶ We'll take a deep breath ¶

1:20:29.959 --> 1:20:32.426
¶ It won't be long this ¶

1:20:32.428 --> 1:20:34.728
¶ There's nothing great here ¶

1:20:34.730 --> 1:20:36.797
¶ I'll come without you ¶

1:20:36.799 --> 1:20:38.833
¶ True love awaits ¶

1:20:38.835 --> 1:20:43.304
¶ Don't throw it
around in your head ¶
