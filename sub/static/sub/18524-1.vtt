32:33.418 --> 32:37.264
But you did read the contract
you signed, Mr. Calley.

32:37.355 --> 32:42.065
Oh, I did, in fact,
read the entire contract, Mr. Weaver.

this whole thing easier on all of us

But it's her father. He wouldn't like it.

34:31.937 --> 34:33.712
Why do you think he wouldn't approve?

34:35.706 --> 34:38.654

He didn't have to leave me.
He abandoned me.
