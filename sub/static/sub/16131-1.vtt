01:48.565 --> 01:51.901
With over a million casualties
from the Battle of Verdun alone,

01:51.936 --> 01:54.279
the death toll continues to climb.

01:56.364 --> 01:59.165
Never before has the battlefield
been so vast

01:59.200 --> 02:02.620
and never before has the fighting
been so gruesome.

02:03.163 --> 02:05.540
Whether on the ground
in brutal trench warfare

02:05.575 --> 02:08.007
or high, high in the skies above them,

02:08.042 --> 02:12.464
millions of young soldiers continue to die
with no end in sight.

02:13.882 --> 02:17.761
It seems as though the German aggressors
cannot be stopped as the Allied nations

02:17.796 --> 02:19.971
valiantly fight to survive.

02:21.097 --> 02:23.600
The Great War rages on.

02:29.647 --> 02:31.281
Hello, Blaine.

02:31.316 --> 02:34.027
You're not gonna give me any problems,
are you?

02:34.652 --> 02:38.072
Got no quarrel with you. Just that banker.

02:38.823 --> 02:42.994
You broke up Sandford's face pretty good.
He's looking to see you in jail.

02:43.328 --> 02:44.996
He had it coming.

02:46.623 --> 02:48.923
I got a bench warrant for your arrest.

02:48.958 --> 02:52.482
I'm gonna give you half an hour
before I serve it.

02:52.517 --> 02:56.007
If I were you, I'd get out of town.
Way out of town.

02:56.674 --> 03:00.428
Fear continues to grow that
without the United States' intervention,

03:00.463 --> 03:02.145
France could soon fall.

03:02.180 --> 03:04.981
Despite President Wilson's refusal
to enter the conflict,

03:05.016 --> 03:09.687
some determined young Americans
have volunteered to join the fray anyway.

03:09.722 --> 03:11.946
Using the latest in flying war machines,

03:11.981 --> 03:16.569
the French have created a new
airborne combat unit just for these Yanks.

03:19.072 --> 03:22.116
From all over,
American boys are making their way

03:22.151 --> 03:25.954
across the Atlantic to learn how to fly.

03:35.463 --> 03:36.679
Good luck, son.

03:36.714 --> 03:39.300
I'll try to bring home a couple of medals
like you and Grandpa.

03:39.335 --> 03:41.177
We'll march together
in the 4th of July parade,

03:41.212 --> 03:42.637
you'll see.

03:44.222 --> 03:46.891
Don't worry, Mom. I got the Jensen blood.

03:47.016 --> 03:50.561
Haven't made the bullet yet
that's stronger than that.

03:54.107 --> 03:58.278
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Write me every day, okay?

03:58.987 --> 04:00.571
All aboard!

04:02.865 --> 04:04.117
I will.

04:15.795 --> 04:18.839
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

04:19.966 --> 04:21.759
I love you, Laura.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.780
I'm gonna learn to fly airplanes.

05:27.325 --> 05:28.785
Come on, now.

05:35.750 --> 05:36.918
Thank you so much.

05:37.001 --> 05:39.212
- Please take great care of them.
- Yes, sir.

05:41.839 --> 05:45.760
Well, you should have
everything you need.

05:45.885 --> 05:47.553
Thank you, Father.

05:47.678 --> 05:51.015
I've made arrangements
to come to Paris in the fall.

05:51.050 --> 05:54.018
- I may come and see you then.
- Yes, Father.

05:54.852 --> 05:56.604
Buck up, my boy.

05:57.146 --> 05:59.822
This noble conflict you're about to enter

05:59.857 --> 06:03.611
is the kind of adventure
that can set one above the herd.

06:03.945 --> 06:04.911
I suppose so.

06:04.946 --> 06:08.533
Damn it, Briggs, have you no enthusiasm
for anything that might distinguish you?

06:08.568 --> 06:10.583
It's quite enough
you've been dismissed from Harvard,

06:10.618 --> 06:16.541
but your continuing lack of direction
has become an embarrassment.

06:16.576 --> 06:19.544
It's time to do something
worthy of your name.

06:21.045 --> 06:23.130
Have you nothing to say?

06:24.382 --> 06:25.716
No, Father.

06:58.040 --> 07:02.086
They said we're supposed to go
to a place on 228 Rue Brion.

07:02.121 --> 07:03.671
That's where we can buy
all our aviator clothes.

07:03.706 --> 07:05.756
I can't understand a word on this map.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.884
Hello? Does anybody here speak English?

07:10.678 --> 07:11.929
Okay.

07:12.763 --> 07:15.016
Brion. Rue Brion.

07:24.317 --> 07:25.860
Right there. Yeah.

07:26.277 --> 07:27.862
Rue Brion. Do you see it?

07:27.945 --> 07:30.448
Excuse me, sir? We're a little lost, and...

07:32.783 --> 07:34.201
Never mind.

07:36.704 --> 07:38.497
Oh, good Lord.

08:22.833 --> 08:26.170
On your right,
you've got the English squadron.

08:26.205 --> 08:29.346
They fly the Bristol, the Sopwith
and the SE5As.

08:29.381 --> 08:31.467
- This place is really something.
- Have you ever seen anything...

08:31.502 --> 08:33.969
And here is the French detachment.

08:34.804 --> 08:36.889
They fly Nieuport 11s.

09:08.295 --> 09:10.548
How many of you speak French?

09:21.517 --> 09:26.021
Our country has been at war since
we were first attacked three years ago,

09:26.056 --> 09:29.733
and we have lost more than a million
of our young men.

09:30.985 --> 09:34.530
Your country turned its back
on this conflict,

09:35.072 --> 09:40.411
but you have bravely volunteered
to join the fight to preserve freedom.

09:40.494 --> 09:45.708
All right, there is not much more to see,
so let's have eyes forward.

09:48.419 --> 09:50.713
We do not expect you to win the war,

09:50.838 --> 09:55.009
only to do what your conscience
commands and your courage allows.

09:55.926 --> 09:59.388
You will train for two months,
then we'll see which one of you

09:59.423 --> 10:02.808
becomes your squadron's first ace.

10:02.843 --> 10:04.268
That'll be me.

10:09.064 --> 10:11.712
- Who are you?
- Blaine Rawlings.

10:11.747 --> 10:14.361
We arrive in uniform, Mr. Rawlings.

10:15.195 --> 10:19.199
Yeah, I wasn't quite sure
how it all went together.

10:20.409 --> 10:21.750
I see.

10:21.785 --> 10:24.413
So these are the new corpses, huh?

10:25.748 --> 10:27.172
What's this?

10:27.207 --> 10:29.376
We got cowpunchers coming over now?

10:29.501 --> 10:31.010
Yeah, I done some cowboying.

10:31.045 --> 10:33.255
You think a six-shooter's
gonna help you up there?

10:33.380 --> 10:37.301
Well, whatever you were using
didn't seem to do you much good.

10:38.052 --> 10:39.685
He's funny.

10:39.720 --> 10:42.139
I may even come to his funeral.

10:43.182 --> 10:47.353
The Captain bother to tell you
the life expectancy for pilots around here?

10:47.388 --> 10:49.104
It's three to six weeks.

10:50.147 --> 10:54.943
Let me guess, you're here because
you thought it'd be fun to fly airplanes.

10:57.863 --> 11:00.032
Go home while you still can.

11:01.492 --> 11:04.411
Guy sure knows how to make friends.

11:04.536 --> 11:06.622
All his friends are dead.

11:21.220 --> 11:22.679
We're here.

11:23.514 --> 11:25.057
There we are.

11:29.019 --> 11:31.021
This is your quarters.

11:32.606 --> 11:36.110
Soon others from your country
will stay here as well.

11:38.445 --> 11:41.031
I've never seen anything like this
back home. Have you?

11:41.066 --> 11:43.200
As a matter of fact, I have.

11:44.284 --> 11:46.870
Beats the hell out of the infantry.

11:47.788 --> 11:49.790
Frenchies sure put on a nice war.

11:59.299 --> 12:01.552
- Home sweet home.
My, oh, my.

12:08.976 --> 12:11.812
- Careful, you oaf!
- Hey, I'm sorry.

12:12.312 --> 12:16.692
That's a 100-year-old bottle of cognac.
It's worth more than you are.

12:16.727 --> 12:17.734
Nice.

12:17.818 --> 12:21.822
Your benefactor, William K. Vanderbilt,
has rented this chÐ²teau for you.

12:24.074 --> 12:25.742
Oh, my God.
- Rawlings, look out!

12:26.994 --> 12:30.038
Somebody help.
Get this... Get. Get.

12:30.998 --> 12:34.751
- Get.
Whiskey. Come on, get off him.

12:36.295 --> 12:40.173
What's the matter there, cowboy?
Having a little trouble with the dogie?

12:41.717 --> 12:44.636
Whiskey is our squadron mascot.
Follow me.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.564
Who keeps a lion as a pet?

12:48.599 --> 12:51.727
Start over there.
I'll give you your room assignments.

12:53.604 --> 12:54.855
Jensen and Toddman.

12:54.938 --> 12:56.023
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:56.058 --> 12:56.940
Room one.

12:57.024 --> 12:59.616
Skinner and Lowry, room number three.

12:59.651 --> 13:02.988
- Excuse me. Skinner and I?
- Is there a problem?

13:07.367 --> 13:12.164
It would be like sharing a room
with one of my servants back home.

13:14.458 --> 13:17.586
Lowry, we'll put you in two with Beagle.

13:18.003 --> 13:21.548
Rawlings, you'll go in three with Skinner.

13:22.174 --> 13:26.470
If there are any further objections,
please take them up with Whiskey.

13:26.505 --> 13:27.436
Okay.

13:27.471 --> 13:29.681
I'll see you all at training
tomorrow morning at 6:30.

13:29.716 --> 13:31.224
Excuse me, sir?

13:31.350 --> 13:34.144
- Who rooms with the lion tamer?
- Cassidy?

13:34.179 --> 13:35.645
He has 20 kills.

13:35.680 --> 13:36.646
Twenty...

13:37.189 --> 13:39.274
He gets a room on his own.

13:46.573 --> 13:48.325
Let's get it over with.

13:48.575 --> 13:51.640
You got any objection to rooming
with a colored man?

13:51.675 --> 13:54.706
I don't know, you're the first one
I ever seen up close.

13:54.741 --> 13:56.583
What have you heard?

13:57.751 --> 14:00.510
I heard it's good luck to rub your head.

14:00.545 --> 14:03.882
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Just telling you what I heard.

14:03.917 --> 14:05.675
Rub my head.

14:08.470 --> 14:12.224
- Think the drinks are free for flyboys?
- Maybe if it's water.

14:44.214 --> 14:46.264
Sorry, gentlemen.

14:46.299 --> 14:50.595
I'm afraid I can't allow you entrance
into this fine establishment.

14:50.630 --> 14:53.640
This respite is reserved for killers.

14:56.434 --> 14:59.896
- You don't look like a killer to me.
- Don't I?

15:00.188 --> 15:02.531
I thought we all are on the same side.

15:02.566 --> 15:06.444
You shot down any Germans
I don't know about, chocolate?

15:08.405 --> 15:11.449
- Not yet.
- Then move on, chaps.

15:16.329 --> 15:18.248
Attaboy, fuzzy.

15:27.716 --> 15:29.926
Did you slip there, killer?

15:31.344 --> 15:32.477
Sit down, Grant.

15:32.512 --> 15:35.015
- I can take him.
- No, you can't.

15:35.050 --> 15:36.057
He's a professional.

15:36.182 --> 15:39.394
I saw him fight in Paris.
He knocked a guy out in the eighth round.

15:39.429 --> 15:40.645
Sixth.

15:55.118 --> 15:58.038
Now, as for all of us being
on the same side,

15:58.163 --> 16:00.957
until you actually do something,
you're not even in this war,

16:00.992 --> 16:02.459
let alone in this room.

16:02.542 --> 16:03.550
Why not?

16:03.585 --> 16:06.921
We're all fighting for the French,
same as you.

16:07.964 --> 16:09.841
Not the same as me.

16:15.055 --> 16:17.140
Let's go, champ.

16:24.439 --> 16:26.524
Still wanna rub my head?

16:32.489 --> 16:35.665
Gentlemen, this is the Nieuport 17.

16:35.700 --> 16:38.828
This plane is the newest French fighter.

16:39.245 --> 16:42.582
When you are proficient enough,
you'll be among the first to fly it.

16:42.617 --> 16:46.419
But remember, it is the man
and not the machine that matters.

16:46.544 --> 16:49.554
His bullet is no faster than yours.

16:49.589 --> 16:53.009
Go on your left. On your right.
Watch your back.

16:53.044 --> 16:54.594
Okay, Skinner.

16:55.512 --> 16:56.679
- That's good.
- I got that.

16:56.763 --> 16:58.063
Watch the fuel.

16:58.098 --> 17:01.768
If you run out of gas,
you will sleep with the Germans.

17:04.270 --> 17:05.278
Stop!

17:05.313 --> 17:07.523
Come on, Toddman. Watch your balance.

17:07.607 --> 17:11.027
No. Come on. Go, go, go.

17:13.113 --> 17:15.615
Come on, Jensen. Go, go, go, Jensen.

17:15.865 --> 17:18.952
Come on, Rawlings. Go, go. Come on.

17:18.987 --> 17:20.744
Watch your balance, no.

17:21.788 --> 17:22.955
Poor Skinner.

17:23.039 --> 17:25.125
A word about equipment.

17:25.625 --> 17:27.961
This is the Escadrille scarf.

17:29.212 --> 17:33.133
It is not just to make you
look good for the girls...

17:33.550 --> 17:34.766
What would he know about that?

17:34.801 --> 17:38.721
...but to keep your neck
from being irritated

17:38.756 --> 17:42.642
from the constant turning
to spot enemy aircraft.

17:42.976 --> 17:44.310
Contact.

17:49.232 --> 17:50.900
- Go on, Rawlings!
- Go, Rawlings!

17:50.935 --> 17:51.901
Go, Rawlings!

18:00.368 --> 18:01.911
- What?
- See it?

18:13.840 --> 18:15.056
All right!

18:15.091 --> 18:16.843
You're on your own, yeah!

18:16.926 --> 18:18.303
He's going.

18:22.599 --> 18:25.101
- Go, Skinner.
- Skinner, let her rip.

18:25.518 --> 18:27.187
- All right, Beagle.
- Go get them. Get up there.

18:27.270 --> 18:28.730
Keep it straight.

18:29.856 --> 18:31.357
Come on, Lowry.

18:32.901 --> 18:38.615
Now that you are actually flying,
it is time to learn about tactics.

18:38.740 --> 18:41.451
Left. Right.

18:42.577 --> 18:43.620
- Both.
- Both.

18:44.787 --> 18:45.705
Right. Left.

18:45.955 --> 18:50.126
In any form of attack,
it is best to fire in short bursts.

18:56.257 --> 18:57.300
Follow him.

18:59.802 --> 19:03.431
Give me right, give me right.
Good, give me left, give me left.

19:05.725 --> 19:06.774
- More your left.
- Left.

19:06.809 --> 19:10.438
Your primary goal is to get on their tail.

19:10.647 --> 19:13.232
This is your best shooting position.

19:16.611 --> 19:19.322
Beagle. The target, Beagle.

19:20.323 --> 19:23.242
Come on, Beagle. The target, Beagle!

19:23.368 --> 19:25.995
Go. Go, Rawlings. That's good.

19:26.371 --> 19:28.755
That's good. Go, Jensen.

19:28.790 --> 19:33.343
Go, Jensen. Good. Good, Skinner.
Good. Well done.

19:33.378 --> 19:36.798
We don't want you bringing
bullets home. We have millions.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.092
Leave the bullets up there.

19:39.759 --> 19:42.136
Let the Germans take them home.

19:55.566 --> 19:57.360
Good shot, Rawlings.

19:57.777 --> 19:58.695
Not bad.

20:00.071 --> 20:02.865
Good shooting, cowboy.
Way to go, Rawlings.

20:09.872 --> 20:11.207
Rawlings.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.877
I want you to go up with Beagle
and teach him how to shoot.

20:14.912 --> 20:17.088
Why me? You're the instructor.

20:17.171 --> 20:20.091
Because I'm tired of trying to teach him.

20:22.301 --> 20:23.636
All right.

20:29.392 --> 20:33.438
Beagle, you need to use
more right rudder when you dive.

20:33.473 --> 20:35.189
I know, I know.

20:35.940 --> 20:37.608
Get off my back.

20:40.236 --> 20:42.488
Notify this Hun's next of kin.

20:45.616 --> 20:47.201
Right rudder!

20:49.412 --> 20:51.643
There's something wrong with the gun!

20:51.678 --> 20:53.875
I know I can fly and I know I can shoot!

20:54.083 --> 20:57.336
Yeah, you just can't do them
at the same time.

21:03.759 --> 21:06.561
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

21:06.596 --> 21:09.849
Let's just fly around a little.
Have some fun.

21:14.312 --> 21:16.397
It's a beautiful country.

21:16.814 --> 21:19.192
Can see why the French fight for it.

21:19.227 --> 21:21.819
- Hey, Rawlings.
- What?

21:25.781 --> 21:28.666
- We're out of gas.
- What?

21:28.701 --> 21:32.246
- You didn't check it when we took off?
- I thought you did.

21:32.281 --> 21:34.332
You're the damn pilot!

21:34.624 --> 21:35.791
All right.

21:35.875 --> 21:39.510
Beagle, put it down over there. Over there.

21:39.545 --> 21:42.882
- No, there's more room over there.
That terrain's too rough.

21:42.917 --> 21:44.884
- Put it over there.
What terrain?

21:44.967 --> 21:47.435
Watch your airspeed.
- I got it.

21:47.470 --> 21:50.389
- We're going too fast!
Just shut up!

22:15.206 --> 22:16.666
Where am I?

22:23.339 --> 22:26.759
Where's my... Where's my plane? My leg.

22:33.015 --> 22:36.811
Is this a... What do you call it?

22:39.271 --> 22:42.191
Do you speak English?

22:44.110 --> 22:47.384
- Hey, Rawlings, you came to.
- How'd we get here, ace?

22:47.419 --> 22:50.561
Well, first of all,
you left the plane in kind of a hurry.

22:50.596 --> 22:53.703
Then this one found you out back
and helped carry you in.

22:54.829 --> 22:56.205
This ain't so bad.

23:19.228 --> 23:21.731
You want me to take my pants off?

23:23.315 --> 23:24.650
Okay.

23:39.749 --> 23:41.715
You seem to be in good hands here.

23:41.750 --> 23:44.587
I'm gonna go see if anybody wants
to look after my leg.

23:44.670 --> 23:46.130
Oh, girls?

23:52.678 --> 23:57.391
So you're a prostitute?

23:59.059 --> 24:01.562
I mean, you don't look like one.

24:03.439 --> 24:05.316
You're very pretty.

24:05.608 --> 24:07.401
You understand? Pretty?

24:08.110 --> 24:09.904
Pretty...

24:12.615 --> 24:13.532
Like...

24:15.034 --> 24:16.035
Like the...

24:17.411 --> 24:20.873
The flower is pretty.

24:21.790 --> 24:27.296
And you are pretty like a flower.

24:29.507 --> 24:31.050
Hey, Rawlings.

24:31.175 --> 24:33.385
You know, they don't give medals
for running out of gas.

24:33.469 --> 24:36.388
- You here to take us back?
- Yeah, but what's the hurry?

24:36.423 --> 24:37.306
Hey, watch it.

24:37.431 --> 24:39.808
What the hell?
She's a chippie, not a nurse.

24:40.559 --> 24:44.647
You do realize that crash landing
your own plane doesn't count as combat.

24:44.730 --> 24:46.607
Sorry about that.

24:47.149 --> 24:51.320
Listen, it was...
It was really nice to meet you.

24:52.988 --> 24:54.240
Yeah.

24:55.574 --> 24:57.660
That was... That was for you.

25:13.175 --> 25:15.594
That guy knows how to live.

25:19.431 --> 25:22.184
Guess all his friends aren't dead.

25:24.019 --> 25:27.189
Come on, Rawlings,
we've got a long drive home.

25:29.775 --> 25:32.486
Hey, Rawlings.
Meet the new arrivals.

25:32.521 --> 25:34.154
I was just showing them around.

25:34.279 --> 25:37.616
Those circular tents at the back
are where the crew live.

25:37.651 --> 25:39.656
And you guys already know
where the canteen is.

25:39.691 --> 25:41.662
Nunn will be sneaking in there
looking for cookies.

25:41.787 --> 25:43.587
He's got a sweet tooth. Right, Nunn?

25:43.622 --> 25:47.209
- Nunn doesn't say a whole lot.
- I can, if something comes up.

25:47.244 --> 25:49.461
That's the mess hall
and the officers' club.

25:49.496 --> 25:50.963
No chapel?

25:51.046 --> 25:53.465
Fellows, meet Porter.

25:53.882 --> 25:57.156
- You religious?
- I keep my Bible close.

25:57.191 --> 26:00.431
What's a man of God doing here at war?

26:00.848 --> 26:03.475
Hopefully the same thing you are.

26:03.976 --> 26:06.895
- How are the barracks, by the way?
- Yeah.

26:07.730 --> 26:11.150
- Nothing fancy.
- Yeah, nothing fancy.

27:46.662 --> 27:49.831
- Whose planes are these?
- They are yours.

28:03.053 --> 28:04.096
Hey!

28:04.846 --> 28:06.181
- Are those really ours?
- These really are amazing.

28:06.216 --> 28:07.766
- We get to fly them?
- These are great.

28:07.849 --> 28:09.851
Merry Christmas, boys.

28:09.935 --> 28:12.771
- This one's mine.
- Almost makes you feel sorry for the Huns.

28:12.806 --> 28:14.189
My, oh, my.

28:14.314 --> 28:17.109
So why do they all have
Indian heads on them?

28:17.144 --> 28:19.076
It is the Escadrille insignia.

28:19.111 --> 28:21.613
Well, why that?
I mean, Indians were defeated.

28:21.648 --> 28:24.915
Yeah, but they were brave. I like it.

28:24.950 --> 28:29.746
You're allowed to have a personal insignia
on the forward part of the fuselage.

28:29.781 --> 28:32.339
Well, that's good.
Let them know who we are.

28:32.374 --> 28:36.211
I've already picked this one out
for myself, so hands off.

28:37.129 --> 28:39.464
No, Skinner, find your own.

29:00.318 --> 29:03.113
It's great. Looks just like it.

29:04.156 --> 29:07.040
- Hey, Lowry, that's good.
- Thanks, Jensen.

29:07.075 --> 29:11.455
I was going to be an artist,
until my father thought better of it.

29:11.747 --> 29:13.380
Would you paint me a knight?

29:13.415 --> 29:15.417
We're kind of like flying knights,
don't you think?

29:15.452 --> 29:17.169
- Sure.
- Thanks.

29:21.673 --> 29:24.384
What's that, Nunn?
- A woodpecker.

29:24.509 --> 29:26.344
That ought to really scare them.

29:26.470 --> 29:28.812
I think it says we're gonna put
a whole bunch of holes in them.

29:28.847 --> 29:32.017
I think that it says that you've got
a bunch of holes in your brain.

29:32.052 --> 29:34.057
Whatever it is, get it done.

29:34.092 --> 29:36.062
We're going to war in two days.

29:36.188 --> 29:38.023
Knights of the air.

29:41.610 --> 29:44.161
What? We are. We're like knights.

29:44.196 --> 29:47.199
The Germans are moving
toward the Meuse River

29:47.234 --> 29:49.951
as part of their push to take Paris.

29:50.452 --> 29:53.545
In order to stop their advance
in our sector,

29:53.580 --> 29:57.542
you will rendezvous over Doulcon
with two Handley Page bombers

29:57.577 --> 30:01.261
at 0600 tomorrow
and escort them to Jametz

30:01.296 --> 30:05.675
where they are to destroy the main
German ammunition and supply depot.

30:06.384 --> 30:10.520
It is heavily fortified
by observation balloons,

30:10.555 --> 30:17.479
cables on three sides,
and Archie batteries in these six positions.

30:17.771 --> 30:20.690
Cassidy will be your squadron leader.

30:20.816 --> 30:22.984
He'll be watching over you.

30:23.735 --> 30:26.112
Remember your training.

30:26.147 --> 30:28.490
Don't fly straight lines.

30:28.615 --> 30:32.494
Be an elusive target
and an efficient hunter.

30:34.162 --> 30:35.705
Any questions?

30:36.748 --> 30:38.083
Yes, sir.

30:38.625 --> 30:40.710
Will we be back by lunch?

30:44.339 --> 30:46.967
I meant any intelligent questions.

30:47.676 --> 30:51.846
I'm sorry, just trying to loosen things up.

30:52.097 --> 30:53.223
Don't.

31:10.448 --> 31:11.866
Hey, fellows.

31:12.200 --> 31:15.120
What do you think I ought
to wear tomorrow? Yellow or purple?

31:15.155 --> 31:17.806
Anything but the pink.
You get shot down in that,

31:17.841 --> 31:20.458
you're gonna embarrass
the entire Escadrille.

31:24.379 --> 31:27.549
What are you talking
about getting shot down for?

31:27.584 --> 31:29.718
What's the matter, you nervous?

31:30.760 --> 31:34.097
Hell, no. You? You brought it up.

31:34.723 --> 31:38.810
We're all nervous, except Porter.

31:38.893 --> 31:40.895
He's got religion on his side.

31:42.564 --> 31:44.316
I'm not nervous.

31:44.733 --> 31:48.403
Hey, it's all right to be a little edgy
before a fight.

31:48.438 --> 31:51.614
Keeps you sharp. Isn't that right, Skinner?

31:52.449 --> 31:56.411
The fights I been in,
they don't shoot at you.

31:59.122 --> 32:01.750
We should hit the sack. We get up at 4:00.

32:06.421 --> 32:07.756
Rawlings.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.928
I wanna see you for a minute.

32:26.524 --> 32:28.193
Just saying hello.

32:29.861 --> 32:31.029
Hello.

32:33.031 --> 32:34.699
Come on in.

32:37.202 --> 32:39.287
I was looking at your file,

32:39.454 --> 32:41.956
and it's my job to write a letter home
to your parents

32:41.991 --> 32:43.923
if anything should happen to you.

32:43.958 --> 32:48.546
Since both your parents are dead,
who's your next of kin?

32:48.880 --> 32:52.092
I don't know. I don't really have any.

33:00.308 --> 33:06.064
You know, if you die here,
your family name dies with you.

33:06.397 --> 33:08.948
Well, I don't plan on dying.

33:08.983 --> 33:12.403
None of the guys
in the squadron cemetery did either.

33:14.614 --> 33:16.074
Think about it.

33:22.747 --> 33:25.333
Yeah, I'll think about that, sir.

33:36.302 --> 33:37.554
Stay.

34:06.958 --> 34:08.507
Lowry?
- Yes, sir.

34:08.543 --> 34:10.920
If you feel you're gonna crash,
take off your goggles

34:10.955 --> 34:13.214
because the glass can cut
your eyes, d'accord?

34:18.219 --> 34:21.347
- Hey, you're still here, Rawlings.
- Yeah.

34:21.889 --> 34:23.725
Thought I'd take my chances.

34:25.101 --> 34:26.561
What's this?

34:27.478 --> 34:30.648
It's just the brand of the ranch
my family owned

34:31.065 --> 34:33.234
till the bank foreclosed.

34:34.819 --> 34:36.779
Beagle, get here.

34:39.489 --> 34:43.745
If your guns jam, it sometimes helps
to bang on the cocking handle.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.170
What's this for?

34:47.206 --> 34:50.300
Plane catches fire, you got three choices.

34:50.335 --> 34:53.170
Can stay in it and burn
with it all the way to the ground,

34:53.206 --> 34:55.672
you can jump from several thousand feet,

34:55.965 --> 34:59.302
or you can take the quick
and painless way out.

35:00.011 --> 35:01.596
Good luck, gentlemen.

35:04.932 --> 35:06.684
Contact!
- Contact.

37:20.693 --> 37:22.069
I'm going up.

38:39.939 --> 38:41.315
Toddman!

40:04.273 --> 40:06.358
Yeah!

40:30.883 --> 40:37.556
Rawlings! I made it!
I'm all right! Go get them!

42:22.161 --> 42:23.877
Bastards were everywhere, sir.

42:23.912 --> 42:26.171
We got jumped
before we reached Jametz.

42:26.206 --> 42:28.417
They were all over us.
We never even made it to the bombers.

42:28.452 --> 42:30.169
- Where is Dewitt?
- Didn't make it.

42:30.252 --> 42:31.385
- And Toddman?
- Nope.

42:31.420 --> 42:34.423
Toddman was right there.
He was right there. Then he was gone.

42:34.458 --> 42:37.015
- Anybody see what happened to Nunn?
- Sir.

42:37.050 --> 42:40.269
He had to put it down.
He made it safely to the ground

42:40.304 --> 42:43.390
and this German dived on him and
shot him right when he was sitting there.

42:43.425 --> 42:46.310
- He had a black falcon on his plane?
- Yeah.

42:47.477 --> 42:48.485
Something should be done.

42:48.520 --> 42:51.127
I mean, you don't just shoot
an airman on the ground.

42:51.162 --> 42:53.734
- Mission debriefing in 15 minutes.
- What about Nunn?

42:53.769 --> 42:55.033
He was just sitting there on the ground!

42:55.068 --> 42:57.953
A lot has happened in this war
before you got to it.

42:57.988 --> 43:01.158
I thought there was supposed to be
some sort of honor in the way we fight.

43:01.193 --> 43:04.543
Reports can be filed. But you want justice?

43:04.578 --> 43:08.248
You're the man in the air,
you're the man with the gun.

43:16.131 --> 43:17.424
Contact.

43:19.259 --> 43:21.762
Get those streamers off my plane.

43:32.940 --> 43:35.776
- What's he doing?
- He's going back up.

43:36.193 --> 43:38.862
- After what?
- Whatever he can find.

43:40.447 --> 43:42.950
- He's going alone?
- Yeah.

43:43.784 --> 43:45.661
He prefers it that way.

43:51.583 --> 43:54.711
I had no idea
that it was going to be like that.

43:55.128 --> 43:57.214
Do better next time.

43:57.964 --> 43:59.681
Soon as I get one kill,

43:59.716 --> 44:01.718
show my father
that I was in the thick of it,

44:01.753 --> 44:03.804
that's it, I'm going home.

44:08.183 --> 44:11.395
Went right through there.
Almost lost this.

44:14.523 --> 44:17.067
- You get any?
- Not the one I wanted.

44:17.359 --> 44:19.152
Not the Black Falcon.

44:21.822 --> 44:22.489
Oi.

44:24.241 --> 44:26.535
Where the hell do you think you're off to?

44:26.570 --> 44:28.203
Not tonight, Grant.

44:30.163 --> 44:32.249
You're not going anywhere.

44:33.750 --> 44:35.836
Not till you drink with us.

44:35.919 --> 44:39.256
- I thought it was only for killers.
- You'll do.

44:48.640 --> 44:53.437
Drink up, Rawlings.
You're still alive. That's something.

44:55.105 --> 44:56.565
I don't feel like it.

44:56.690 --> 44:59.359
The first time is always your hardest.

44:59.484 --> 45:01.445
To losing your virginity!

45:08.368 --> 45:11.788
Does anyone here care
that three pilots died today?

45:11.997 --> 45:13.373
Pilots die every day.

45:13.457 --> 45:14.881
Have a drink. Calm down.

45:14.916 --> 45:17.627
I don't wanna calm down.
I wanna honor the men who died.

45:17.662 --> 45:20.464
Yeah, well, this is how we honor them.

45:20.755 --> 45:23.258
It's how we've always honored them.

45:23.467 --> 45:25.308
Now, none of us knows
how much time we have left,

45:25.343 --> 45:30.056
so we can't waste it sitting around
grieving about things we can't change.

45:31.308 --> 45:33.894
So you can either join in

45:34.811 --> 45:38.481
or you can go up to your room
and cry like a little baby.

45:38.516 --> 45:40.150
You suit yourself.

45:57.751 --> 45:59.961
Wake up, Rawlings. We're here.

46:03.173 --> 46:04.341
Hello.

46:06.009 --> 46:08.094
I'm looking for the owner.

46:08.303 --> 46:10.597
No English. No English.

46:12.474 --> 46:15.602
- The owner of the house?
- I am the owner.

46:16.228 --> 46:20.941
Hi. I'm Blaine Rawlings.
I'm looking for a girl.

46:20.976 --> 46:22.192
You might remember me.

46:22.275 --> 46:26.238
- I injured my leg and she bandaged it up.
- Oh, Lucienne.

46:27.489 --> 46:30.408
Maybe. She was wearing a brown skirt.

46:30.617 --> 46:33.203
But Lucienne is not one of my girls.

46:33.536 --> 46:35.587
- She's not?
- No, she does not work here.

46:35.622 --> 46:39.709
She was exchanging supplies,
a round of Brie for some chocolate.

46:43.964 --> 46:46.383
A round of Brie for some chocolate.

46:46.549 --> 46:47.801
Madam?

46:48.635 --> 46:49.803
Madam.

46:50.136 --> 46:52.389
That girl, Lucienne,

46:53.473 --> 46:55.190
do you know where she lives?

46:55.225 --> 46:58.061
Down the Marlier Road,
about five kilometers.

46:58.561 --> 46:59.569
A small chÐ²teau,

46:59.604 --> 47:03.483
And how about that horse outside?
Do you know who owns that?

47:51.531 --> 47:52.574
Right.

48:14.137 --> 48:15.221
What?

48:22.061 --> 48:23.146
You know,

48:24.689 --> 48:28.651
- I'm mad at you. I'm mad. Understand?
- No.

48:29.486 --> 48:31.905
I'm mad. I'm mad at you.

48:34.699 --> 48:38.244
Because you made me think
that you were a prostitute.

48:39.162 --> 48:40.663
- You know?
- No.

48:44.083 --> 48:45.418
One moment.

48:55.011 --> 48:55.970
You?

48:57.013 --> 48:58.264
Are you?

48:59.432 --> 49:00.433
No.

49:01.517 --> 49:02.435
Well.

49:04.604 --> 49:05.772
Am I?

49:06.814 --> 49:07.774
No.

49:09.734 --> 49:10.777
No.

49:12.654 --> 49:16.824
No, I came because I wanted to see you.

49:17.951 --> 49:20.787
I wanted to see

49:22.956 --> 49:23.915
you.

49:30.171 --> 49:33.633
Why did you pretend to...

49:39.889 --> 49:42.684
I afraid.

49:44.477 --> 49:46.020
You're afraid?

49:47.563 --> 49:48.648
Why?

49:53.736 --> 49:54.779
You

49:57.156 --> 49:59.492
die soon.

50:07.917 --> 50:10.837
Are these your children?

50:16.884 --> 50:18.678
- Oh, no.
- No?

50:21.764 --> 50:23.683
They're your brother's?

50:26.686 --> 50:27.937
- Wife.
- Wife.

50:27.972 --> 50:28.980
Wife?

50:29.105 --> 50:32.442
Your brother and his wife's?
Their children? Oh.

50:35.945 --> 50:37.030
Die?

50:38.865 --> 50:40.033
They died?

50:42.744 --> 50:43.703
Yes.

51:02.221 --> 51:04.724
Brother et wife.

51:10.146 --> 51:11.522
I'm sorry.

51:13.316 --> 51:17.236
The enfants must be sad.

51:22.784 --> 51:24.243
I have an idea.

51:25.077 --> 51:26.120
Come on.

51:50.853 --> 51:51.854
Hey!

51:52.522 --> 51:55.441
Hey. Hey! Hey!

52:02.823 --> 52:04.200
Thank you.

52:05.618 --> 52:07.203
Did you like it?

52:07.411 --> 52:09.789
Does that mean I can come back?

52:11.707 --> 52:13.793
Can I come see you again?

52:15.878 --> 52:17.838
No, not the kids. You.

52:18.381 --> 52:20.883
Would you like to see me again?

52:23.469 --> 52:24.512
All right, bye.

52:27.848 --> 52:29.725
What are you gonna do?

52:36.607 --> 52:39.944
The Germans just bombed
the railway yard at Revigny.

52:40.069 --> 52:43.155
If you hurry, you can cut them off.

52:43.698 --> 52:46.617
It is a chance to be more aggressive
in your tactics.

52:46.652 --> 52:47.576
I want those chocks.

52:47.743 --> 52:51.330
If you do well,
you may get another chance at Jametz.

52:51.831 --> 52:54.959
Let's get the jump
and dictate the engagement.

52:55.167 --> 52:56.210
Hurry.

52:57.169 --> 52:59.338
Come on, let's go.

53:06.429 --> 53:09.015
Come on, I'm keeping you guys alive.

58:04.142 --> 58:05.943
Now that's more like it.

58:05.978 --> 58:07.980
We really stitched them up good today.

58:08.063 --> 58:09.196
What?

58:09.231 --> 58:11.942
It's so goddamn noisy up there.
I can't hear a thing.

58:12.067 --> 58:15.279
You got two today, Blaine.
You're our ace so far.

58:15.487 --> 58:17.990
Well, you fired enough to take down six.

58:18.407 --> 58:21.243
You ever think about trying to miss,
Beagle? You might do better.

58:21.278 --> 58:22.661
I told you, my gun's all screwy.

58:22.786 --> 58:24.392
Oh, really? It's your gun, is it?

58:24.427 --> 58:25.998
What are you trying to say, Lowry?

58:26.033 --> 58:27.583
Cut it out.

58:27.666 --> 58:30.085
Someone should mention Porter.
He got one.

58:30.120 --> 58:31.635
Yeah, well, I was lucky.

58:31.670 --> 58:33.630
Germans just didn't want
to hear you sing anymore.

58:33.665 --> 58:35.507
Hey. Where's Higgins?

58:37.509 --> 58:38.510
No.

58:39.678 --> 58:41.346
I gotta sit down.

58:45.309 --> 58:47.603
- Is it bad?
- You're all right.

58:48.437 --> 58:50.522
Bullet went right by you.

58:58.780 --> 59:00.032
There's our men!

59:01.158 --> 59:03.333
The Yanks got their first Huns.

59:03.368 --> 59:05.454
- Good show.
- Well done. Excellent.

59:05.954 --> 59:08.540
Now you're officially killers.

59:09.207 --> 59:10.208
Come here, lads.

59:10.243 --> 59:11.585
Well done.

59:18.884 --> 59:22.012
We call this the Bottle of Death.

59:23.889 --> 59:26.808
You get one swig
for every plane you down.

59:28.143 --> 59:32.647
Only reason I'm still alive is some German
let me go when my gun jammed.

59:32.682 --> 59:34.364
I don't know why the hell he did it.

59:34.399 --> 59:37.444
Did he have
two crossed swords on his plane?

59:39.404 --> 59:42.657
Franz Wolfert. A triple ace.

59:45.786 --> 59:48.413
He did it
because of what happened to Nunn.

59:48.448 --> 59:50.374
He won't let you off again.

59:52.584 --> 59:55.087
We know what happened to Higgins.

59:56.213 --> 59:57.464
Drink up.

01:00:15.107 --> 01:00:16.942
- Porter.
- I don't drink.

01:00:18.026 --> 01:00:19.152
- Come on.
- Take a drink...

01:00:19.277 --> 01:00:20.778
- I don't drink.
- Come on.

01:00:20.813 --> 01:00:22.280
- Take a drink.
- Drink up.

01:00:22.364 --> 01:00:26.451
- Drink, drink, drink, drink!
- Drink, drink, drink, drink!

01:00:39.047 --> 01:00:41.049
Those guys sure can
tie one on. I mean...

01:00:41.084 --> 01:00:42.057
Yeah.

01:00:42.092 --> 01:00:43.885
...the more they fly, the more they drink.
- Yeah.

01:00:43.969 --> 01:00:46.680
Except for Cassidy.
He just goes on even more missions.

01:00:46.715 --> 01:00:48.637
The man's a mystery. He's not human.

01:00:48.672 --> 01:00:50.524
We don't even know where he's from.

01:00:50.559 --> 01:00:53.624
I heard that he lost his family
in an electrical fire.

01:00:53.659 --> 01:00:56.690
- Did you hear that?
- I heard he flew for Pancho Villa.

01:00:56.725 --> 01:00:57.697
So he's a mercenary?

01:00:57.732 --> 01:00:59.282
Why don't somebody just ask?

01:00:59.317 --> 01:01:02.529
Well, he's not too chatty
about his personal life.

01:01:02.564 --> 01:01:04.197
I'd just be happy he's flying on our side.

01:01:04.322 --> 01:01:05.240
Yeah.

01:01:05.448 --> 01:01:07.742
Especially with the new tri-wings
the Germans got,

01:01:07.777 --> 01:01:09.709
125-horsepower engines.

01:01:09.744 --> 01:01:12.955
Nine-millimeter Spandau machine guns
with twice the ammo capacity.

01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:16.167
They can out-turn us
and they have a 1,000 feet-a-minute climb.

01:01:16.202 --> 01:01:17.801
They're the most maneuverable planes
in the sky.

01:01:17.836 --> 01:01:19.921
Well, yeah, maybe you'd be happier
fighting for them.

01:01:19.956 --> 01:01:22.340
Yeah. A lot fewer of our guys
would get shot.

01:01:22.375 --> 01:01:23.675
Real funny.

01:01:25.176 --> 01:01:26.928
- Hey, listen.
- What?

01:01:27.846 --> 01:01:30.473
There's something not right about Beagle,
you know?

01:01:30.508 --> 01:01:31.481
What do you mean?

01:01:31.516 --> 01:01:34.901
- I mean, he doesn't get any mail, right?
- So?

01:01:34.936 --> 01:01:37.689
Yeah, he never hits
any of the Germans he shoots at.

01:01:38.106 --> 01:01:40.865
Well, a lot of guys don't have kills.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:44.946
And now he's an expert on German
aircraft. When did that happen?

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.199
Man, you're scratching fleas
on a stuffed dog.

01:01:48.825 --> 01:01:49.868
Nothing there.

01:01:49.951 --> 01:01:51.501
Right, we'll see.

01:01:51.536 --> 01:01:53.538
Blaine, hey, I'm telling you,

01:01:54.122 --> 01:01:56.875
there's something not right with that guy.

01:02:04.049 --> 01:02:05.717
Hey, you asleep?

01:02:07.052 --> 01:02:08.136
No.

01:02:10.221 --> 01:02:13.433
A few years ago,
we didn't even have airplanes.

01:02:13.642 --> 01:02:15.609
Now there's thousands of us,

01:02:15.644 --> 01:02:19.147
with one half trying to kill the other half.

01:02:19.182 --> 01:02:21.232
Yeah, that's how it goes.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.903
You really have your own ranch?

01:02:24.938 --> 01:02:28.156
I did, 900 acres.

01:02:28.573 --> 01:02:31.076
Was in my family for 85 years.

01:02:31.659 --> 01:02:33.710
It was a tradition.

01:02:33.745 --> 01:02:37.207
Grow up and you work the ranch.

01:02:37.242 --> 01:02:38.750
Till my ma left and

01:02:40.752 --> 01:02:43.254
my dad died all mortgaged out.

01:02:45.256 --> 01:02:48.224
It was kind of hard to make a go of it.

01:02:48.259 --> 01:02:52.013
So what you gonna do now?
I mean, when the war is over?

01:02:52.048 --> 01:02:53.473
I don't know.

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:58.770
Maybe I'll keep flying
if there's any call for it.

01:03:00.855 --> 01:03:02.649
Or get a new ranch.

01:03:03.358 --> 01:03:04.943
How about you?

01:03:05.985 --> 01:03:07.445
Hard to say.

01:03:08.279 --> 01:03:11.950
I came here
'cause I heard they treated Negroes better.

01:03:14.035 --> 01:03:16.413
- Do they?
- They were good to me.

01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:21.209
I don't wanna go back to boxing.

01:03:22.877 --> 01:03:27.257
I'm tired of pounding on people,
keeping my anger up all the time.

01:03:29.134 --> 01:03:30.802
And I like flying.

01:03:32.053 --> 01:03:36.015
Hell, if you're not fighting,
it's nice and peaceful up there.

01:03:37.267 --> 01:03:39.144
Nobody can touch you.

01:03:40.186 --> 01:03:43.106
Nobody can make you feel low.

01:03:45.817 --> 01:03:48.945
You think there'll be any future
in flying after the war?

01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:50.196
Maybe.

01:03:52.824 --> 01:03:57.412
I mean, there's always giving people
rides at fairs and things like that.

01:03:58.413 --> 01:04:04.169
And I hear they might use planes
to deliver mail from city to city.

01:04:04.252 --> 01:04:05.503
Really?

01:04:07.172 --> 01:04:11.175
Yeah, I like that.
That'd be a good job for me.

01:04:13.261 --> 01:04:17.181
I figure as long as I'm up in the air,
they can't see me,

01:04:18.433 --> 01:04:20.768
they won't mind if I'm black.

01:04:24.606 --> 01:04:27.108
There's something wrong with Jensen.

01:04:27.143 --> 01:04:28.693
He's down here.

01:04:37.619 --> 01:04:38.578
Hey?

01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:40.788
Hey?

01:04:41.915 --> 01:04:42.957
Jensen?

01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:45.793
Can you hear me?

01:04:46.294 --> 01:04:48.796
- Jensen?
- Thought this might happen.

01:04:49.297 --> 01:04:52.342
Jensen?
You're going through a little shock.

01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:53.850
Don't think about flying for a while.

01:04:53.885 --> 01:04:55.136
You don't have to go up again
until you're ready.

01:04:55.261 --> 01:04:56.930
You understand me?

01:04:57.972 --> 01:05:00.141
Do you understand me, Jensen?

01:05:06.522 --> 01:05:09.233
He tries flying tomorrow, stop him.

01:05:10.693 --> 01:05:12.654
Not that you'll have to.

01:05:13.071 --> 01:05:15.823
Meantime, get him some bourbon.

01:05:16.324 --> 01:05:19.035
- Go get the bourbon.
- I'll get it.

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:43.351
- How you are?
- Non, Say, "How are you?"

01:05:48.356 --> 01:05:49.899
"How are you?"

01:06:17.009 --> 01:06:19.929
- How you are?
- How are you?

01:06:23.474 --> 01:06:24.899
That's good.

01:06:24.934 --> 01:06:28.896
You speak English now.
Then we can have a conversation.

01:06:30.064 --> 01:06:32.233
Let me hear your English.

01:06:34.402 --> 01:06:35.903
Good you see?

01:06:36.904 --> 01:06:38.406
Yeah, good.

01:06:38.906 --> 01:06:40.658
Good to see you, too.

01:06:58.176 --> 01:06:59.260
See?

01:07:00.803 --> 01:07:03.598
This is my rabbit. Wanna pet it?

01:07:03.931 --> 01:07:06.767
Better be gentle. He's jumpy.

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:10.271
Oh.

01:07:10.938 --> 01:07:13.941
He looks a little cold.
I think we'll give him a little blanket there.

01:07:13.976 --> 01:07:16.861
How's that? There you go.

01:07:20.531 --> 01:07:22.074
What about you?

01:07:22.491 --> 01:07:24.452
Do you ever have any fun?

01:07:30.833 --> 01:07:32.084
No time.

01:07:33.044 --> 01:07:36.380
No, you're wrong.
Right now's the perfect time.

01:07:37.214 --> 01:07:40.301
We don't know how many chances
we're gonna get.

01:07:41.052 --> 01:07:44.889
Want to take a ride? In my avion?

01:07:45.848 --> 01:07:46.807
- Come on.
- No.

01:07:46.974 --> 01:07:48.225
- Come on.
- No.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:30.165
Here.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:40.383
Picked a great day to fly, didn't I?

01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:44.345
Did you have fun in the air?

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:48.725
Fun in the plane?

01:09:53.729 --> 01:09:54.689
Okay.

01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:58.443
What's this?

01:10:01.029 --> 01:10:02.697
"It's not good

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:06.535
"for me to like you. "

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:10.413
Why?

01:10:13.333 --> 01:10:16.253
"Because I worry. "

01:10:18.129 --> 01:10:20.215
You're worried about me?

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:46.575
For me?

01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:49.327
From Marie?

01:10:51.288 --> 01:10:53.665
Maybe he'll bring me good luck.

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:05.594
Paris?

01:11:05.677 --> 01:11:07.345
I've never been.

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:12.017
Maybe you could take me.
Show me all them lights.

01:11:20.066 --> 01:11:21.318
Afraid?

01:11:22.861 --> 01:11:25.780
- There's a war.
- Am I afraid of the war?

01:11:28.408 --> 01:11:29.451
No.

01:11:30.618 --> 01:11:32.370
- No?
- No.

01:11:36.207 --> 01:11:37.375
Okay.

01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:40.628
Yes.

01:11:43.965 --> 01:11:45.842
Every time I go up,

01:11:46.634 --> 01:11:48.011
I'm afraid.

01:12:32.764 --> 01:12:34.015
Rawlings.

01:12:36.184 --> 01:12:39.604
- You hear about Beagle?
- No, what?

01:12:40.563 --> 01:12:42.357
I went to Thenault about him.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.568
- Why would you do that?
- Thenault had him checked out.

01:12:45.603 --> 01:12:47.529
His whole background's all wet laundry.

01:12:47.654 --> 01:12:51.533
- Everything in his file is made-up.
- They think he's a spy.

01:12:55.995 --> 01:12:59.172
Your behavior has raised suspicion
among the men,

01:12:59.207 --> 01:13:04.546
and now we discover
that Eddie Beagle is not your real name.

01:13:04.629 --> 01:13:08.091
- It's Arthur Becker, huh?
- So I changed my name.

01:13:08.126 --> 01:13:10.301
You're from Wisconsin, I see.

01:13:11.636 --> 01:13:14.889
There is a very large German population
in Wisconsin

01:13:14.924 --> 01:13:16.850
and your name is German.

01:13:17.267 --> 01:13:18.643
I'm no spy.

01:13:18.726 --> 01:13:23.523
Why didn't you give us your correct name?
Are you a German sympathizer?

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.483
No.

01:13:25.942 --> 01:13:27.450
We will find out the truth.

01:13:27.485 --> 01:13:30.321
- Look, it's not what you think.
- Why not?

01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:36.160
We shoot spies, you know.

01:13:38.663 --> 01:13:40.623
Sir, may I?

01:13:43.751 --> 01:13:44.794
Beagle.

01:13:47.171 --> 01:13:50.091
- Come clean.
- I can't.

01:13:50.216 --> 01:13:53.428
They're gonna shoot you.
What could be worse than that?

01:13:53.463 --> 01:13:56.312
- I swear I'm not a spy.
- I know.

01:13:56.347 --> 01:13:59.892
So just tell them what you did
or they're gonna lock you up.

01:13:59.927 --> 01:14:01.769
Is that what you want?

01:14:08.693 --> 01:14:11.070
I committed a crime back in the States.

01:14:12.405 --> 01:14:15.116
- Spit it out, Beagle.
- I robbed a bank.

01:14:15.992 --> 01:14:18.870
Hey, I was in debt to a bookie,
and I needed the money.

01:14:18.905 --> 01:14:21.706
Was anyone hurt
in the robbery?

01:14:21.741 --> 01:14:22.749
No.

01:14:22.832 --> 01:14:24.709
How can we be sure?

01:14:26.794 --> 01:14:28.880
Because I used a toy gun.

01:14:29.964 --> 01:14:31.347
Excuse me?

01:14:31.382 --> 01:14:34.010
I used a toy gun. It was all I had.

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.601
Can you prove what you're saying?

01:14:42.143 --> 01:14:43.186
No.

01:14:44.437 --> 01:14:45.688
I can't.

01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:47.357
I can.

01:14:51.736 --> 01:14:54.322
I saw a discrepancy in his next of kin file

01:14:54.357 --> 01:14:56.949
so I sent away for more information,

01:14:57.575 --> 01:15:01.120
and I was sent these telegrams
confirming the robbery.

01:15:02.246 --> 01:15:05.082
Beagle, in his haste
to escape an armed guard,

01:15:05.117 --> 01:15:07.919
dropped most of the money
along with the toy gun.

01:15:07.954 --> 01:15:11.255
And although he escaped with only $12.36,

01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:12.972
he is guilty of armed robbery

01:15:13.007 --> 01:15:14.640
and if he was returned
to the United States,

01:15:14.675 --> 01:15:17.560
they would lock him up
for a very, very long time.

01:15:17.595 --> 01:15:22.517
The question for us is, can we allow him
to continue flying for the Escadrilles

01:15:22.552 --> 01:15:25.937
because we have no legal jurisdiction
in this matter?

01:15:28.356 --> 01:15:30.024
It is up to you.

01:15:30.525 --> 01:15:32.193
Don't look at me.

01:15:32.819 --> 01:15:35.738
Whether he continues to fly is up to them.

01:15:36.364 --> 01:15:38.116
It's their squadron.

01:15:41.869 --> 01:15:46.999
Well, I'd like to know what you would have
done if they didn't give you the money.

01:15:47.625 --> 01:15:50.510
I don't know. Throw the toy gun at him?

01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:53.673
- You probably would have missed.
- Definitely.

01:16:04.642 --> 01:16:05.560
Sir?

01:16:07.728 --> 01:16:10.481
We don't condone what Beagle's done,

01:16:11.274 --> 01:16:14.235
or the horrible way in which he botched it.

01:16:15.152 --> 01:16:19.615
But we also don't think he should be
thrown out on stupidity alone.

01:16:19.650 --> 01:16:22.708
Although I'd never trust him
with my wallet,

01:16:22.743 --> 01:16:26.414
I think we all will continue to trust him
with our lives,

01:16:26.831 --> 01:16:30.918
on the off chance that one day
he might actually hit something.

01:16:34.755 --> 01:16:36.090
So be it.

01:16:58.863 --> 01:17:02.491
Toy gun, huh? That's good. Yeah.

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:18.758
You see, that's why
we have to load our own ammo.

01:17:18.793 --> 01:17:21.886
Half these bullets are bent.
Then the guns jam.

01:17:22.178 --> 01:17:24.145
They spotted a group of Fokkers.

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:26.557
They're headed towards our infantry
on the road to Rambucourt.

01:17:26.592 --> 01:17:27.642
Let's go.

01:18:43.843 --> 01:18:45.803
Yes! Yeah!

01:18:46.554 --> 01:18:47.680
Lowry!

01:22:53.759 --> 01:22:56.803
- Can you move?
- No, something's pinning my hand.

01:23:04.311 --> 01:23:06.605
Just get out of here, Rawlings!

01:23:30.379 --> 01:23:33.715
Hey, come here, come here, come here.
Push the tail up.

01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:35.092
Wait. Wait.

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:42.182
Okay, push! Push!

01:23:47.479 --> 01:23:51.024
- Rawlings, please, just go.
- I'm not gonna leave you.

01:23:54.695 --> 01:23:56.029
Just go!

01:24:15.549 --> 01:24:17.509
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Beagle.

01:24:17.544 --> 01:24:20.137
No, Rawlings, no!

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:22.931
Get up!

01:24:23.974 --> 01:24:25.517
Move! Go!

01:24:26.476 --> 01:24:27.936
Go!

01:24:44.619 --> 01:24:45.871
My hand!

01:25:01.303 --> 01:25:03.054
Mind if I join you?

01:25:13.106 --> 01:25:14.441
This is a

01:25:15.275 --> 01:25:19.446
100-year-old bottle of Louis XV.
It's incredible.

01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:23.617
Would you care to share a glass with me?

01:25:24.242 --> 01:25:26.536
This 'cause I saved your life?

01:25:27.287 --> 01:25:30.290
No. No, it's because
I've been a pompous ass.

01:25:33.543 --> 01:25:35.086
Pour me a glass.

01:25:41.885 --> 01:25:43.185
Oh, my.

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:45.805
I stole this from my father's cellar.

01:25:46.139 --> 01:25:49.059
If he'd have known, he would probably say

01:25:49.142 --> 01:25:53.104
it's the only thing I've ever done
successfully in my life.

01:25:53.855 --> 01:25:54.981
Please.

01:26:08.328 --> 01:26:09.496
Nice.

01:26:11.081 --> 01:26:12.832
I'm glad you like it.

01:26:13.959 --> 01:26:16.586
He's gotta be proud you came here.

01:26:18.463 --> 01:26:19.631
No.

01:26:20.966 --> 01:26:24.719
Actually, it was kind of his idea.

01:26:28.181 --> 01:26:32.727
And how many planes you gotta
bring down to get back in his good graces?

01:26:33.061 --> 01:26:34.813
Probably just my own.

01:26:39.317 --> 01:26:41.277
What does your father do?

01:26:43.363 --> 01:26:45.240
My daddy was a slave.

01:27:11.558 --> 01:27:13.935
You restless tonight, Rawlings?

01:27:17.272 --> 01:27:18.606
Maybe.

01:27:20.817 --> 01:27:24.487
- What about you?
- It was a good day.

01:27:26.156 --> 01:27:27.824
Not for Wolfert.

01:27:29.993 --> 01:27:34.497
- You had no choice but to kill him.
- He had a choice with me.

01:27:35.832 --> 01:27:38.126
Yeah, whatever happened in the air
or whatever happened on the ground

01:27:38.161 --> 01:27:41.337
with Beagle,
you gotta get that out of your head.

01:27:42.839 --> 01:27:44.257
Okay.

01:27:45.133 --> 01:27:47.767
Meanwhile, Beagle goes through life
without a hand.

01:27:47.802 --> 01:27:51.181
He volunteered for this war.
He knew what he was getting into.

01:27:52.098 --> 01:27:55.101
I don't care what happened in the past.
You can't let that affect you.

01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:57.937
You got to forget about it.
Otherwise you're a danger to yourself

01:27:57.972 --> 01:28:00.023
and everyone else up there.

01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:03.026
Do you let go of the past?

01:28:06.362 --> 01:28:07.447
I...

01:28:09.199 --> 01:28:11.075
I heard some things.

01:28:15.038 --> 01:28:18.374
- That you lost...
- That I lost my family in a fire?

01:28:22.212 --> 01:28:26.508
No. I didn't fly for Pancho Villa either.

01:28:28.384 --> 01:28:32.472
The truth is, I was a lot like you.

01:28:33.389 --> 01:28:36.392
Full of idealism,
maybe even a sense of honor.

01:28:39.938 --> 01:28:43.316
Then you realize this war
ain't gonna be won by either side.

01:28:44.317 --> 01:28:46.319
Some day it'll just end.

01:28:55.828 --> 01:28:59.165
And everyone will go home,
get on with their lives.

01:29:00.792 --> 01:29:03.753
Tall grass will cover the battlefield.

01:29:05.922 --> 01:29:09.133
And all the pilots we've lost
wouldn't have changed a damn thing.

01:29:14.055 --> 01:29:15.848
Guys like you won't quit.

01:29:17.183 --> 01:29:20.019
So I got to stick around
and try to knock some Huns off your tails,

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:23.147
and give you a chance to survive
this useless war.

01:29:23.356 --> 01:29:26.776
- That's what you do.
- Not with enough success.

01:29:28.444 --> 01:29:31.572
The guys I started with
are a testament to that.

01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:39.497
Well, if this war is really meaningless,
then why do you fly extra missions?

01:29:39.914 --> 01:29:42.125
Get the ones I've missed.

01:29:44.293 --> 01:29:46.879
Get the ones that killed my friends.

01:29:52.844 --> 01:29:55.763
You got to find your own meaning
in this war.

01:29:57.015 --> 01:30:00.768
I mean, I'll be real disappointed
if we had more pilots die in vain

01:30:00.803 --> 01:30:02.311
than the Germans.

01:30:12.447 --> 01:30:14.240
How many you got left?

01:30:15.992 --> 01:30:17.243
One.

01:30:18.286 --> 01:30:19.829
The Black Falcon.

01:30:52.487 --> 01:30:55.677
See, this whole wing.
Patch on a patch.

01:30:55.712 --> 01:30:58.833
And when they gonna send us
a new canvas?

01:30:58.868 --> 01:31:01.057
- Always "next time. "
- Hey, Rawlings.

01:31:01.092 --> 01:31:03.608
The Germans have crossed
the Meuse River.

01:31:03.643 --> 01:31:06.125
And reports say they've overrun Souilly.

01:31:06.542 --> 01:31:08.127
Lucienne.

01:31:08.961 --> 01:31:11.464
Is that plane fuelled? Is this plane fuelled?

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:12.680
- Rawlings!
- Yes, sir.

01:31:12.715 --> 01:31:14.849
Give me a start. Give me a start. Let's go.

01:31:14.884 --> 01:31:17.929
Rawlings, you know you're
not allowed to take the plane!

01:31:43.913 --> 01:31:46.290
Hey. Hey.

01:31:48.167 --> 01:31:50.982
- You all right? You all right?
- Yeah?

01:31:51.017 --> 01:31:53.798
- How you come?
- My plane. Avion,

01:31:55.883 --> 01:31:59.345
- Germans.
- All right. I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:32:00.179 --> 01:32:02.348
No, it's all right.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:07.144
Go get them. Go get them.

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:16.195
- If Rawlings returns alive, arrest him.
- Yes, sir.

01:32:19.031 --> 01:32:21.832
- Good luck.
- Stay right here. Okay?

01:32:21.867 --> 01:32:23.411
You don't go anywhere.
You stay right here.

01:32:33.963 --> 01:32:36.340
I'll be back before sunrise.

01:32:47.476 --> 01:32:48.644
- You got her?
- Got them.

01:32:48.728 --> 01:32:49.777
Come on, guys.

01:32:49.812 --> 01:32:52.863
What are you doing flying at night
without authorization?

01:32:52.898 --> 01:32:55.700
I don't have time to explain.
I have to go get one more person.

01:32:55.735 --> 01:33:00.323
This plane is not for your personal use.
Leave this plane and return to quarters.

01:33:00.358 --> 01:33:02.408
- That's an order!
- Yes, sir.

01:36:27.196 --> 01:36:28.947
Freeze!

01:36:30.866 --> 01:36:34.078
Hang on, Lucienne. Hang on.

01:37:00.145 --> 01:37:02.231
Monsieur Rawlings.

01:37:14.827 --> 01:37:16.745
Medic!

01:37:19.832 --> 01:37:21.333
Medic!

01:37:24.545 --> 01:37:26.213
Over here, over here.

01:39:10.067 --> 01:39:11.193
Doctor!

01:39:23.955 --> 01:39:27.167
They're taking you
to the hospital at Reims.

01:39:27.202 --> 01:39:28.710
You understand?

01:39:31.129 --> 01:39:33.680
They're right here. They're gonna be fine.

01:39:33.715 --> 01:39:36.468
They contacted your uncle,
and he's gonna take care of them

01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:39.137
until you recover. Okay?

01:39:40.097 --> 01:39:44.393
- Yes. You come?
- Yeah.

01:39:45.227 --> 01:39:49.398
- I'll come see you in Reims.
- Goodbye.

01:39:49.689 --> 01:39:51.066
Okay.

01:39:52.734 --> 01:39:53.735
All right.

01:40:01.493 --> 01:40:04.579
I have filled out the papers
formally charging you

01:40:04.614 --> 01:40:06.338
with dereliction of duty.

01:40:06.373 --> 01:40:12.003
That sort of thing cannot be tolerated
in a military unit. Not even this one.

01:40:12.337 --> 01:40:17.217
Reports indicate that an Escadrille pilot
flew four French refugees

01:40:17.342 --> 01:40:20.762
out of occupied territory
while being shot at

01:40:20.797 --> 01:40:24.182
by both riflemen and anti-aircraft cannons.

01:40:25.267 --> 01:40:26.601
Busy night.

01:40:27.018 --> 01:40:32.232
I have been in direct communication
with HQ in Paris over your little escapade.

01:40:33.692 --> 01:40:36.924
They agree with
my recommendation completely.

01:40:36.959 --> 01:40:40.157
So it won't do you any good
to go over my head.

01:40:42.033 --> 01:40:44.417
- Take the cuffs off.
- Sir...

01:40:44.452 --> 01:40:48.206
Unless you want to fly his plane.
I think I forgot to sign that.

01:40:48.241 --> 01:40:50.458
Ask me about it again tomorrow.

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:59.342
Congratulations, Rawlings.
And don't ever do that again.

01:41:10.061 --> 01:41:11.855
I won't, sir.

01:41:28.246 --> 01:41:30.748
Gentlemen,
there is a change of plan.

01:41:30.783 --> 01:41:33.216
We've had a little surprise thrown at us.

01:41:33.251 --> 01:41:36.636
A German zeppelin is on its way
to bomb Paris.

01:41:36.671 --> 01:41:41.634
As you know, our French and British
pilots are engaged at Pont-Ð°-Mousson.

01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:46.598
So Rawlings, Lowry, Skinner and Porter
will have to go after the zeppelin.

01:41:46.633 --> 01:41:48.815
Remember to load incendiary bullets.

01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:51.735
It can take hundreds
to bring down a zeppelin.

01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:55.940
The rest of the squadron will support
the others at Pont-Ð°-Mousson.

01:41:56.191 --> 01:41:59.277
- May God be with you.
- Thank you, sir.

01:41:59.402 --> 01:42:00.654
Courage.

01:42:02.322 --> 01:42:03.782
- Courage.
- For thine is the kingdom, the power

01:42:03.865 --> 01:42:06.618
and the glory forever and ever. Amen.

01:42:08.578 --> 01:42:09.829
Courage.

01:42:10.538 --> 01:42:11.623
All right.

01:44:50.406 --> 01:44:54.702
You go down!
I'll take the zeppelin!

01:48:06.435 --> 01:48:08.229
No!

01:48:42.096 --> 01:48:45.015
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:48:49.937 --> 01:48:55.234
Today we have lost two brave fighters.
Two friends.

01:48:58.028 --> 01:49:03.576
Porter once told me that if he died,
he wanted to be buried by the airfield.

01:49:03.784 --> 01:49:06.078
Near those he fought alongside.

01:49:08.038 --> 01:49:12.877
I'm sure Cassidy would rather be buried
behind the whorehouse.

01:49:16.714 --> 01:49:20.801
Only a few days ago,
Cassidy gave me this letter

01:49:20.836 --> 01:49:24.555
to give to Rawlings in the event he died.

01:49:25.681 --> 01:49:27.766
Rawlings, please.

01:49:48.829 --> 01:49:53.751
"If I do not return,
my burial is of no import.

01:49:55.586 --> 01:49:59.048
"Make it as easy as possible
for yourselves.

01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:03.344
"I have no religion
and do not care for any service.

01:50:04.595 --> 01:50:07.181
"If the omission would bother Porter,

01:50:09.767 --> 01:50:12.102
"I guess I would stand the ceremony.

01:50:13.437 --> 01:50:17.566
"Good luck to you all. Vive la Escadrille,

01:50:17.601 --> 01:50:21.695
"the only real friends I ever had. Cassidy. "

01:50:24.907 --> 01:50:27.534
A lot of us owe this man our lives.

01:50:28.535 --> 01:50:30.329
We won't forget him.

01:51:00.359 --> 01:51:01.819
Sir,

01:51:03.153 --> 01:51:06.073
I made a promise
that I'd meet someone at Reims.

01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:10.786
- Can I have permission to leave the base?
- Yes.

01:51:39.273 --> 01:51:40.816
Excuse me.

01:51:41.358 --> 01:51:42.609
Sorry.

01:51:43.736 --> 01:51:45.529
Excuse me, I'm looking for...

01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:50.951
Lucienne!

01:51:54.037 --> 01:51:55.831
Lucienne!

01:51:57.624 --> 01:51:59.460
Lucienne!

01:52:19.813 --> 01:52:21.482
Lucienne!

01:52:35.579 --> 01:52:37.748
I afraid.

01:52:38.665 --> 01:52:42.419
- Not see you.
- Yeah.

01:52:44.087 --> 01:52:45.881
You look good.

01:52:47.257 --> 01:52:49.218
Yeah. Okay.

01:52:51.595 --> 01:52:53.931
We go to England.

01:52:55.057 --> 01:52:56.934
Not safe for children.

01:52:57.851 --> 01:53:00.479
- Germans come here.
- I know.

01:53:04.441 --> 01:53:08.111
You and me in Paris

01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:11.198
after war?

01:53:12.032 --> 01:53:14.660
Your English is getting so good.

01:53:17.162 --> 01:53:18.288
I try.

01:53:19.456 --> 01:53:22.584
How will I reach you?
I'm gonna be moving.

01:53:27.047 --> 01:53:29.967
I have so much I wanna say to you.

01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:35.389
You will be in my thoughts

01:53:37.057 --> 01:53:39.893
and in my heart.

01:54:12.092 --> 01:54:15.846
I'll see you in Paris.
We'll turn on them lights.

01:54:15.971 --> 01:54:20.434
Be careful.
I will not be here to count the planes.

01:54:54.134 --> 01:54:56.720
Gentlemen, we are going
to make another run

01:54:56.755 --> 01:54:59.198
on the munition depot at Jametz.

01:54:59.233 --> 01:55:01.606
This time escorting four bombers.

01:55:01.641 --> 01:55:06.229
Instead of a frontal attack,
we fly south to Marcheville first

01:55:06.264 --> 01:55:09.065
and then swing north to the strike area.

01:55:09.983 --> 01:55:14.154
This way, we might be able to surprise
them and get closer to the target

01:55:14.189 --> 01:55:16.865
before encountering resistance.

01:55:17.073 --> 01:55:20.327
As you may have heard,
the United States has just announced

01:55:20.362 --> 01:55:22.377
its entrance into the war.

01:55:22.412 --> 01:55:24.045
- Oh, good.
- Thank God for that.

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:27.549
I don't need to tell you
that if we destroy Jametz,

01:55:27.584 --> 01:55:31.671
we severely reduce the flow
of ammunition to the German troops.

01:55:31.706 --> 01:55:34.382
Your brothers will be fighting
on the ground.

01:55:35.008 --> 01:55:41.264
I know the last attack on Jametz
was a hard initiation for many of you.

01:55:42.307 --> 01:55:46.061
But I have watched you grow
and develop since then,

01:55:46.096 --> 01:55:48.772
both as men and pilots,

01:55:49.397 --> 01:55:52.609
and I can say that I am proud
to be your captain.

01:55:53.026 --> 01:55:56.613
You have more than exceeded
my expectations.

01:55:57.322 --> 01:55:59.199
Good luck to you all.

01:56:09.543 --> 01:56:11.503
Think you might have dropped that.

01:56:16.508 --> 01:56:18.885
I told her I was gonna be a hero.

01:56:23.306 --> 01:56:27.352
Look, you got nothing to be ashamed of.

01:56:29.229 --> 01:56:33.733
- You went up there and you fought.
- Yeah. Ain't that something?

01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:36.820
Hey, you're gonna be all right.

01:56:37.571 --> 01:56:40.282
- You're already over the jitters.
- Yeah, jitters.

01:56:40.490 --> 01:56:43.326
Yeah. I fixed that.

01:56:47.664 --> 01:56:51.126
I tell Thenault I'm gonna go up again
so he won't send me home,

01:56:51.161 --> 01:56:53.301
but I don't go back up.

01:56:53.336 --> 01:56:58.216
I just watch you guys day after day,
wondering how you do it,

01:57:00.302 --> 01:57:03.013
how everybody in my family did it,

01:57:06.433 --> 01:57:09.769
why I'm the only one who can't.

01:57:12.188 --> 01:57:14.155
All right, come on.

01:57:14.190 --> 01:57:18.778
Why don't you just go?
Go sleep this off and try again tomorrow.

01:57:18.813 --> 01:57:21.156
- Yeah, yeah, tomorrow.
- Okay?

01:57:21.191 --> 01:57:22.198
Okay.

01:57:24.492 --> 01:57:25.744
Okay.

01:57:26.703 --> 01:57:30.040
- We're the knights of the air, remember?
- Yeah.

01:57:31.458 --> 01:57:32.625
- Contact?
- Contact.

01:57:37.547 --> 01:57:41.718
Rawlings, requesting permission
to go on this mission, sir.

01:57:41.885 --> 01:57:45.055
- What's that?
- I rigged this up in the machine shop.

01:57:45.090 --> 01:57:47.640
I can fly with it. Tested it out yesterday.

01:57:48.141 --> 01:57:52.562
All right, but if I feel
you're a detriment to the squadron

01:57:52.597 --> 01:57:55.356
and I wave you off, you go right home,
you understand?

01:57:55.482 --> 01:57:58.276
- Perfectly.
- Don't kill yourself on takeoff.

01:57:58.311 --> 01:58:00.653
Hey, guys, I'm flying!

01:58:09.412 --> 01:58:13.708
Captain Thenault told me I should have it
painted on your plane.

01:58:14.417 --> 01:58:16.419
I hope you don't mind.

01:58:23.426 --> 01:58:24.844
I'm honored.

02:00:21.753 --> 02:00:22.879
Oh, shit.

02:01:34.450 --> 02:01:37.370
Come on, Eddie, do something right.

02:01:47.672 --> 02:01:50.466
Beware the hook!

02:02:30.423 --> 02:02:31.674
All right!

02:02:58.451 --> 02:03:02.455
Congratulations, Beagle. Welcome back.

02:03:04.290 --> 02:03:06.709
I wish Lowry had made it here to see this.

02:03:12.965 --> 02:03:14.967
Where's he going?

02:06:07.389 --> 02:06:10.559
Knights of the air!
