WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:03.488
PREVIOUSLY
ON PRETI'Y LITI'LE LIARS...

00:03.530 --> 00:06.135
MRS. DILAURENTIS HAS OFFERED
TO LET US STAY WITH HER.

00:06.170 --> 00:07.694
YOU'RE GONNA SLEEP
IN ALI'S OLD BED?

00:07.740 --> 00:10.106
HELL NO.
I'M NOT MOVING IN THERE.
EM, YOU HAVE TO.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.505
YOU KNEW I WASN'T
HIS FATHER.

00:11.540 --> 00:14.202
I GAVE MYSELF THE ANSWER
THAT I WANTED.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.606
YOU LET ME FALL IN LOVE
WITH HIM.
I'M SORRY.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.710
Toby: MY MOM USED
TO PLAY THIS SONG ALL THE TIME.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.638
"A" IS TELLING YOU
TO DITCH EDDIE LAMB

00:21.680 --> 00:23.216
AND GO FOR DR. PALMER.

00:23.250 --> 00:25.389
HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU
NEED ME TO KEEP THIS A SECRET?

00:25.420 --> 00:26.717
Emily:
WE HAVE TO FACE FACT 5--

00:26.760 --> 00:28.489
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE TOGETHER
NEXT YEAR.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.080
THEY'RE ALLEGING THAT I BULLIED
MONA INTO GIVING HER CONFESSION.

00:31.130 --> 00:33.121
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YOUR MOTHER
DOESN'T HAVE A LAWYER.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.025
HOW JEALOUS
WERE YOU TONIGHT?

00:37.630 --> 00:39.666
Mrs. DiLaurentis:
DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE
SOMEBODY USED THIS

00:39.700 --> 00:41.236
AS THEIR TEMPORARY HOME.

00:41.270 --> 00:42.532
Emily:
SHOULD WE CALL THE POLICE?

00:42.570 --> 00:45.334
Mrs. DiLaurentis:
I'M SURE THEY'RE LONG GONE.

00:52.450 --> 00:54.668
DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK SHE'S
BEEN LIVING IN THAT CRAWL SPACE?

00:54.720 --> 00:56.745
ARIA,
THERE WAS A SLEEPING BAG.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.485
BUT NAPPING ISN'T LIVING.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.353
UNLESS YOU'RE A REPTILE,
WHICH KIND OF DESCRIBES CECE.

01:01.390 --> 01:03.449
LEAST THE CECE THAT
MRS. DILAURENTIS REMEMBERS.

01:03.490 --> 01:04.855
BUT NOT JUST MRS. D.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.551
EVEN SHANA'S
SCARED OF THIS GIRL.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.420
YEAH, WELL
I'M SCARED OF SHANA.

01:08.460 --> 01:11.258
SHE'S NOT THE ONE
WHO USED JENNA'S HEAD
AS BATTING PRACTICE

01:11.300 --> 01:14.167
AT YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY.
YEAH, WHY IS CECE
GOING AFTER JENNA?

01:14.200 --> 01:16.407
WHY WOULD SHE GO AFTER
ANY OF US?

01:16.440 --> 01:19.273
WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HER
GETTING KICKED OUT OF COLLEGE.

01:19.310 --> 01:21.198
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ALI
COULD'VE TOLD HER.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.470
WHAT COULD ALI HAVE POSSIBLY
SAID THAT WOULD MAKE CECE

01:23.510 --> 01:25.273
HATE US ENOUGH TO DRILL HOLES
UNDER ALI'S HOUSE

01:25.310 --> 01:26.777
AND STARE UP EMILY'S SKIRT?

01:26.820 --> 01:29.141
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO LIVE IN THAT HOUSE?

01:29.190 --> 01:30.782
HANG OUT
ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

01:30.820 --> 01:32.754
AND WEAR UNDERWEAR
AT ALL TIMES.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.380
I'M EATING THIS.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.379
HEY. WHERE YOU BEEN?

01:38.430 --> 01:39.590
UH, WITH MY MOM.

01:39.630 --> 01:40.756
SHE MET ANOTHER LAWYER.

01:42.230 --> 01:43.197
HOW'D IT GO?

01:43.230 --> 01:44.663
NOT GREAT.
( sighs )

01:44.700 --> 01:46.565
THEY'RE ALL
JUST BO'I'I'OM-FEEDERS

01:46.600 --> 01:48.295
TRYING TO MAKE A NAME
FOR THEMSELVES.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.307
THERE ARE OTHER ONES.

01:49.340 --> 01:50.705
EM, SHE'S MET ALL OF THEM.

01:50.740 --> 01:52.628
THEY DON'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENS TO HER.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.830
SHE'S JUST...
CASE NUMBER 79.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.269
YOUR MOM'S GONNA FIND SOMEBODY
WHO REALLY CARES ABOUT HER.

01:57.310 --> 01:59.346
SHE ALREADY FOUND SOMEONE
WHO CARED.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.610
WHY CAN'T YOU TELL YOUR MOM
TO ASK THE JUDGE

02:01.650 --> 02:02.742
TO GET BACK ON THAT CASE?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.485
'CAUSE "A"
TOOK HER DOWN, HANNA.

02:04.520 --> 02:05.919
SPENCER, TALK TO HER.

02:05.950 --> 02:06.917
PLEASE.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.882
MY MOM TRUSTS HER.
SHE NEEDS HER.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.478
I KNOW, AND MY MOM
IS NOT DESERTING HER.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.020
SHE JUST--
SHE HAS TO FIGURE OUT

02:12.060 --> 02:15.359
WHAT KIND OF ROLE SHE CAN
PLAY WITHOUT COMPROMISING
YOUR MOM'S DEFENSE.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.492
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

02:16.530 --> 02:17.758
WHO?

02:17.800 --> 02:19.358
LIEUTENANT TANNER.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.765
WHY IS SHE AT OUR SCHOOL?

02:20.800 --> 02:22.768
DOUBT IT'S
FOR THE BAKED ZITI.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.335
HELLO, LADIES.
MAY I JOIN?

02:26.680 --> 02:29.342
I HEAR YOU AND YOUR MOTHER
MOVED IN WITH A NEIGHBOR.

02:29.380 --> 02:32.872
MUST BE NICE
NOT HAVING TO USE A DESK
AS AN IRONING BOARD.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.673
HAVE YOU BEEN BACK
TO YOUR HOUSE SINCE
THE ACCIDENT?

02:35.720 --> 02:37.381
NO, I HAVEN'T.

02:37.420 --> 02:38.682
WELL I'M JUST HERE, LADIES,

02:38.720 --> 02:40.779
TO REMIND YOU
THAT THE LOCAL P.D.

02:40.820 --> 02:42.481
IS STILL INVESTIGATING.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.452
DID THEY FIND OUT
WHO WAS DRIVING THAT CAR?

02:44.490 --> 02:45.525
NO.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.198
NOT YET.

02:47.230 --> 02:49.790
OH, BUT THEY DID
FIND SOMETHING INTERESTING

02:49.830 --> 02:51.661
WHILE THEY WERE
SORTING THROUGH THE WRECKAGE.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.429
WHAT?
WHAT WAS IT?

02:53.470 --> 02:55.165
A SHOE.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.662
A MUDDY SHOE...

02:57.710 --> 02:59.632
THAT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

02:59.680 --> 03:01.671
MATCHES THE SHOEPRINTS

03:01.710 --> 03:03.678
FROM THE WILDEN CRIME SCENE...

03:03.710 --> 03:06.372
WHICH FALLS
UNDER MY JURISDICTION.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.376
DO THEY KNOW WHOSE
SHOE IT IS?

03:08.420 --> 03:11.389
WELL WE SPOKE
TO YOUR MOTHER, EMILY.
WE KNOW IT'S NOT HERS.

03:11.420 --> 03:13.809
AND WE HAVE WAYS
OF TESTING THESE THINGS OUT.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.714
YOU KNOW, D.N.A. AND STUFF.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.954
SOMETHING WRONG, HANNA?

03:16.990 --> 03:18.685
NO, I'M JUST--

03:18.730 --> 03:19.958
I HAVE TO USE THE RESTROOM.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.258
GEEZ, I HOPE I DIDN'T
RUIN ANYONE'S LUNCH.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.576
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT? *

03:35.610 --> 03:38.249
* SWEAR THIS ONE
YOU'LL SAVE *

03:38.280 --> 03:40.669
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

03:40.720 --> 03:42.938
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

03:42.990 --> 03:48.280
* IF I SHOW YOU THEN I'LL KNOW
YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

03:48.320 --> 03:50.823
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN
KEEP A SECRET *

03:50.860 --> 03:52.953
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

03:58.300 --> 03:59.699
Spencer: HANNA.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.265
HANNA, COME ON,
DON'T LET TANNER
FREAK YOU OUT

04:02.310 --> 04:04.403
ABOUT A MUDDY SHOE.
IT'S PROBABLY NOT EVEN
WHY SHE CAME HERE.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.998
OH, REALLY?
IT WAS ABOUT THE BAKED ZITI?

04:06.040 --> 04:08.679
NO, LOOK, "A" PUT THAT SHOE
IN EMILY'S HOUSE

04:08.710 --> 04:10.268
'CAUSE MONA
MADE A CRAZY MOVE.

04:10.310 --> 04:11.868
WHY DOES "A"
CARE WHAT MONA SAYS?

04:11.910 --> 04:14.014
BECAUSE HER CONFESSION
SCREWED WITH "A's" PERFECT PLAN

04:14.050 --> 04:15.369
TO FRAME YOUR MOTHER.

04:15.420 --> 04:16.819
YEAH, AND TANNER'S
JUST FISHING TO SEE

04:16.850 --> 04:18.442
IF WE WERE THE ONES
WHO PUT MONA UP TO IT.

04:18.490 --> 04:20.287
SHE'S BEEN AFTER ME
SINCE THAT "GUILTY" VIDEO

04:20.320 --> 04:21.480
WAS DELIVERED TO THE POLICE.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.886
OKAY, SHE'S JUST
TRYING TO SCARE US
INTO SPILLING SOMETHING.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.852
YEAH, WELL IT WORKED.
MY BREAKFAST.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.619
WE NEED TO PUT CECE
ON TANNER'S RADAR.

04:27.660 --> 04:28.888
HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

04:28.930 --> 04:30.795
JUST INVITE HER
INTO THE CRAWLSPACE?

04:30.830 --> 04:32.798
NO, WE ARE GONNA
GO INTO THE CRAWLSPACE

04:32.840 --> 04:34.398
THIS AFTERNOON,
AFTER SCHOOL,

04:34.440 --> 04:35.668
AND HOPEFULLY
FIND SOME PROOF

04:35.700 --> 04:37.509
THAT CECE'S BACK IN TOWN
AND LIVING DOWN THERE.

04:37.540 --> 04:40.031
IF WE GO DOWN THERE,
MRS. D. IS GONNA
START ASKING QUESTIONS.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.571
WELL MRS. D. ISN'T GONNA
BE THERE 'CAUSE HANNA'S
GOING SHOPPING WITH HER.

04:42.610 --> 04:44.669
FOR WHAT? THINGS TO WEAR
WHILE VISITING MY MOTHER

04:44.710 --> 04:45.677
ON A CHAIN GANG?

04:45.710 --> 04:46.916
NO. TONIGHT'S DANCE.

04:46.950 --> 04:48.872
SPENCER! IAM NOT
GOING TO THAT HOEDOWN!

04:48.920 --> 04:50.649
OKAY? I CANNOT
LEAVE MY MOTHER ALONE.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.009
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO THE HOEDOWN.

04:52.050 --> 04:54.314
YOU JUST HAVE TO WASTE
AN HOUR OR TWO WITH MRS. D.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.588
TRYING ON BOLO TIES, OKAY?

04:55.620 --> 04:58.327
AND YOU TWO ARE GONNA MEET ME
UNDERNEATH THE HOUSE AT 4:00.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.497
( phone beeps )
OKAY.

05:01.630 --> 05:02.927
YOU OKAY?

05:02.970 --> 05:04.460
UH, YEAH.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.559
YEAH, NO-- I'M GONNA
MEET YOU GUYS UNDER THE HOUSE.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.635
OKAY?

05:07.670 --> 05:08.898
( school bell rings )

05:08.940 --> 05:10.407
( sighs )

05:12.480 --> 05:13.469
( sighs )

05:14.480 --> 05:16.300
( locker slams )

05:25.550 --> 05:26.756
( sighs )

05:44.640 --> 05:45.937
HEY, THERE.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.073
HEY.

05:47.110 --> 05:49.032
IS TONIGHT STILL HAPPENING?

05:49.080 --> 05:50.445
TONIGHT?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.072
THE DANCE.

05:52.110 --> 05:53.111
OH.

05:53.150 --> 05:55.118
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO.

05:55.150 --> 05:57.118
NOT REALLY GOOD
AT LINE DANCING, ANYWAY.

05:57.150 --> 05:59.482
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
UH, MAYBE?

05:59.520 --> 06:01.579
I HAVE A LOT OF STUFF
GOING ON, BUT...

06:01.620 --> 06:02.848
I'LL CALL YOU.

06:02.890 --> 06:04.448
WHAT'S THAT?

06:04.490 --> 06:05.980
A RECOMMENDATION LETTER.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.998
NICE.
ZOE CAME THROUGH?

06:08.030 --> 06:09.019
YEAH.

06:10.030 --> 06:10.997
WOW.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.531
IT'S LONG.

06:12.570 --> 06:14.458
AND GUSHING.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.866
YEAH.
THAT'S HOW ZOE TALKS.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.060
REALLY?
ABOUT EVERY VOLUNTEER?

06:19.110 --> 06:21.032
HER SPIRIT
MADE MY HEART RACE?

06:21.080 --> 06:22.741
SHE'S POETIC.

06:22.780 --> 06:24.600
SHE'S INTO YOU.

06:24.650 --> 06:27.471
SHE'S BEING SUPPORTIVE.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.544
EMILY, I'VE BEEN TO WEDDINGS

06:28.580 --> 06:30.741
WHERE PEOPLE DON'T SAY STUFF
LIKE THIS IN THEIR VOWS.

06:30.790 --> 06:31.882
( grunts softly)

06:31.920 --> 06:33.581
I HAVE TO GET TO CLASS.

06:35.790 --> 06:36.927
( sighs )

06:40.700 --> 06:42.827
ARIA.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.098
HI.
HEY.

06:44.130 --> 06:44.926
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

06:44.970 --> 06:47.097
I WAS GONNA OFFER YOU
A LIFT HOME,

06:47.140 --> 06:48.630
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE--
( car beeps )

06:48.670 --> 06:50.467
YEAH, I DROVE MYSELF.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.637
UH, WANNA TAKE A DETOUR
FOR A COFFEE?

06:52.680 --> 06:53.772
I'LL--I'LL TAILGATE YOU.

06:53.810 --> 06:56.176
LOVE TO, BUT I--
I HAVE SO MUCH STUFF

06:56.210 --> 06:57.507
I HAVE TO DO TODAY.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.199
THAT'S COOL.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.218
I JUST WANTED
TO PASS ON A NAME

07:01.250 --> 07:04.014
OF A HOT-SHOT ATTORNEY
WHO'S A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.

07:04.050 --> 07:05.984
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET OF YOU.

07:06.020 --> 07:08.557
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN SPENCER'S
MOM AND HANNA'S, BUT--

07:08.590 --> 07:11.923
THINK, UM, MRS. MARIN'S
ALREADY FOUND SOMEBODY ELSE.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.455
( grunts softly)

07:14.500 --> 07:15.922
YEAH.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.189
DO YOU TWO-STEP?

07:20.240 --> 07:21.935
IN A PARKING LOT?

07:21.970 --> 07:24.131
IN A BARN
IN WATERTOWN TONIGHT.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.673
THE SCHOOL'S THROWING
THIS WESTERN THINGY.

07:26.710 --> 07:27.938
WOULD YOU WANNA GO?

07:27.980 --> 07:29.800
YES.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.249
OH.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.247
OKAY.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.247
( chuckles )
WHAT?

07:33.280 --> 07:35.043
YOU CHANG|\IIEOYOUR MIND?

07:35.080 --> 07:37.480
THAT...WAS JUST SO EASY.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.987
WHAT'S WRONG WITH EASY?

07:39.020 --> 07:40.715
NOTHING.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.785
IT'S...JUST BEEN A LONG TIME

07:42.830 --> 07:44.684
SINCE I COULD GO
TO A SCHOOL DANCE WITH SOMEBODY

07:44.730 --> 07:45.958
THAT I'M...

07:45.990 --> 07:47.651
DATING.
( chuckles )

07:48.730 --> 07:50.561
WHAT TIME SHOULD YOUR DATE
PICK YOU UP?

08:02.810 --> 08:04.846
UM, HI.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.245
BUSY?

08:06.280 --> 08:07.747
I SHOULD BE.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.849
WHAT IS THAT?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.812
WELL, I DID
WHAT YOU SUGGESTED

08:11.850 --> 08:14.011
AND I REACHED OUT
TO MY SUPERVISOR IN HAITI.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.857
SHE WROTE THIS.

08:18.230 --> 08:19.652
ARE YOU GROWING A BEARD?

08:20.660 --> 08:21.627
WHAT?

08:21.660 --> 08:22.661
NO.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.290
THIS IS GLOWING.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.592
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.596
IS IT TOO GLOWING?

08:28.640 --> 08:30.961
I MEAN DOES IT SOUND
LIKE MY MOTHER WROTE IT?

08:31.010 --> 08:34.070
EMILY, THERE ARE PEOPLE
WITH REAL PROBLEMS
IN THE WORLD,

08:34.110 --> 08:36.032
AND GETTING A GLOWING
COLLEGE RECOMMENDATION

08:36.080 --> 08:38.105
ISN'T ONE OF THEM.

08:39.580 --> 08:41.047
SORRY I BOTHERED YOU.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.548
EMILY--

08:47.120 --> 08:48.917
I HAVE A LOT
ON MY MIND RIGHT NOW.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.019
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
SNAPPED AT YOU.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.291
IS THIS ABOUT ARIA?

08:55.600 --> 08:57.898
SORRY, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE ASKED YOU THAT.

08:57.930 --> 09:00.160
MAGGIE IS MOVING
ACROSS THE COUNTRY

09:00.200 --> 09:02.088
AND TAKING MALCOLM
WITH HER.

09:02.140 --> 09:05.132
W--HOW CAN SHE
JUST DO THAT?

09:05.170 --> 09:06.876
I MEAN,
YOU'RE MALCOLM'S FATHER.

09:06.910 --> 09:09.071
I'D LIKE TO BE THE FIRST
TO TELL ARIA,

09:09.110 --> 09:11.146
SO I'D REALLY APPRECIATE
IF YOU WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.554
HANNA, HEY.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.325
DO YOU NEED A RIDE?

09:29.360 --> 09:31.225
UH, NO.
I'M GOING SHOPPING

09:31.270 --> 09:33.659
AT MACY'S
WITH MRS. DILAURENTIS.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.759
WHAT--YOU'RE SHOPPING

09:35.800 --> 09:36.960
WITH ALISON'S MOM?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.830
WELL I CAN'T WITH MY OWN.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.679
HER ANKLE BRACE
WOULD GO OFF

09:40.710 --> 09:42.200
ANY TIME SHE
OPENS A WINDOW TOO FAST.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.969
RIGHT.

09:44.010 --> 09:45.875
WELL, OKAY, THEN I GUESS
I'LL JUST COME BY

09:45.910 --> 09:47.343
AND PICK YOU UP
FOR THE ROUND-UP.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.211
NO, WE DON'T
HAVE TO GO TO THAT--

09:49.250 --> 09:50.945
ACTUALLY, WE DO.

09:50.990 --> 09:53.208
YOUR MOM TEXTED ME
DURING CHEM.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.909
SHE TOLD ME TO GRAB YOU
AT 8:00.

09:54.960 --> 09:55.949
IT WAS AN ORDER.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.628
SHE WANTS YOU
TO LIVE YOUR LIFE, HAN.

09:59.660 --> 10:00.752
WHATEVER.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.066
COME ON,

10:03.100 --> 10:05.295
GIDDY-UP, LITTLE DOGGIE.

10:05.330 --> 10:06.695
( sighs )

10:10.810 --> 10:12.163
( sighs )

10:24.120 --> 10:25.189
( sighs )

10:43.240 --> 10:44.264
IT WAS IN HANNA'S LOCKER.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.902
WHY WOULD CECE
USE AN ENVELOPE

10:45.940 --> 10:47.737
FROM THE PLACE
WHERE SHE USED TO WORK?

10:47.780 --> 10:49.008
SHE WOULDN'T.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.871
SO YOU DON'T
THINK IT'S CECE?

10:50.910 --> 10:52.138
( sighs )

10:52.180 --> 10:53.818
I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS.

10:53.850 --> 10:55.408
WELL IT'S JUST
SUCH A CARELESS MOVE.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.111
DO YOU THINK SHE WANTS US
TO FIND OUT IT'S HER?

10:57.150 --> 10:59.141
( stammers )
THERE ARE EASIER WAYS
TO DO IT.

10:59.190 --> 11:01.215
WELL WHY IS SHE SUDDENLY
GIFTING YOU AND HANNA--

11:01.260 --> 11:03.319
SPENCER, I DON'T FEEL
LIKE ASKING QUESTIONS,

11:03.360 --> 11:05.351
AND NOT WHEN
I'M GETTING ANSWERS.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.767
YEAH, AND THEY ALSO
FEED TURKEYS

11:09.800 --> 11:12.963
LOTS OF TASTY TREATS BEFORE THEY
CHOP THEIR HEADS OFF.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.093
( sighs )
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HANNA WOULD BE GIVEN A GIFT

11:15.140 --> 11:17.199
THE SAME DAY HER MOTHER'S
MUDDY SHOE

11:17.240 --> 11:19.003
SUDDENLY SHOWS UP.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.029
WHAT IS IT?

11:20.080 --> 11:22.002
Woman on Radio:
* ANYTIME

11:22.040 --> 11:23.007
WHO'S SINGING?

11:23.050 --> 11:25.177
* YOU'RE FEELING BLUE

11:25.210 --> 11:26.370
MY MOTHER.

11:26.410 --> 11:28.446
WHAT?
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

11:28.480 --> 11:29.788
( singing continues )

11:29.820 --> 11:32.243
I DON'T--I DON'T...KNOW.

11:32.290 --> 11:34.178
YOU DIDN'T PUT THIS IN HERE?

11:34.220 --> 11:36.085
TAKE IT OUT!

11:36.120 --> 11:39.055
TOBY, PLEASE!
PLEASE TAKE THIS OUT RIGHT NOW!

11:39.090 --> 11:40.091
( music stops )

11:44.500 --> 11:45.728
( sighing )

12:02.820 --> 12:04.879
HEY, HOW YOU DOIN'?
CAN--CAN I GET A WATER?

12:13.130 --> 12:14.791
( sighs )

12:18.370 --> 12:19.359
( clears throat )

12:19.400 --> 12:21.095
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ME?

12:21.140 --> 12:22.960
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE

12:23.010 --> 12:25.001
OR WHY YOU FIND ME
SO DAMN INTERESTING,

12:25.040 --> 12:27.474
BUT IF YOU DON'T STOP,
YOU'RE GONNA BE
ONE SORRY STALKER.

12:27.510 --> 12:28.977
( sighs )

12:32.250 --> 12:33.410
Toby:
I'LL GO TO PALMER TONIGHT.

12:33.450 --> 12:35.372
I-IF HE CAN REMEMBER WHERE
HE STORED THE REST OF THESE--

12:35.420 --> 12:38.116
TOBY, PALMER IS NOT
A RELIABLE SOURCE.

12:38.150 --> 12:40.118
OKAY, HE THOUGHT
THAT I WAS YOUR MOTHER!

12:40.160 --> 12:41.513
HE THOUGHT THAT
MRS. DILAURENTIS WAS--

12:41.560 --> 12:43.824
HE MAY REMEMBER WHERE HE
KEPT THE REST OF HIS SESSIONS.

12:43.860 --> 12:46.385
LOOK, THIS IS A CLASSIC
"A" MOVE.

12:46.430 --> 12:48.250
I MEAN, IF "A"
WASN'T BEING DEVIOUS,

12:48.300 --> 12:49.824
WHY DID SHE HAVE TO BREAK
INTO YOUR CAR

12:49.870 --> 12:51.121
DO DELIVER THIS TO YOU?

12:51.170 --> 12:52.967
SHE WAS PROBABLY HOPING
YOU'D HEAR IT AND YOU'D

12:53.000 --> 12:54.536
WRAP YOUR TRUCK AROUND A TREE.

12:54.570 --> 12:57.004
I'M GONNA SEE PALMER TONIGHT.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.564
YOU WANNA COME WITH ME
OR NOT?

12:58.610 --> 12:59.929
NOT.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.538
I'M MEETING ARIA AND EMILY.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.535
WHY?

13:02.580 --> 13:04.104
SO WE CAN FIND SIGNS OF CECE

13:04.150 --> 13:06.004
IN THAT FRICKIN'
CRAWLSPACE.

13:07.550 --> 13:08.517
( phone dialing )

13:08.550 --> 13:09.881
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:09.920 --> 13:11.148
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

13:11.190 --> 13:12.282
PALM ER.

13:12.320 --> 13:16.017
TOBY, DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

13:16.060 --> 13:18.381
YOU ARE COMPLETELY
UNDER "A's" SPELL.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.125
CAN WE PLEASE, PLEASE,

13:20.160 --> 13:22.128
JUST TAKE A BREATH
AND TRY TO PROVE THAT CECE

13:22.160 --> 13:23.991
IS "A" BEFORE WE
MAKE ANOTHER MOVE?

13:24.030 --> 13:25.327
Woman on Phone:
SARATOGA GARDENS.

13:25.370 --> 13:27.133
HOW MAY I DIRECT YOUR CALL?

13:27.170 --> 13:28.865
HELLO?

13:28.900 --> 13:30.333
HELLO?

13:33.310 --> 13:34.607
WHERE'S SPENCER?

13:34.640 --> 13:36.608
ALWAYS HAS THE BEST
FLASHLIGHT.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.074
ISN'T SHE THE ONE
THAT SAID TO MEET AT 4:00?

13:39.110 --> 13:41.317
YEAH, SHE'LL BE HERE.

13:41.350 --> 13:43.910
( sighs )
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SPOKE WITH EZRA?

13:43.950 --> 13:46.009
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
WHY?

13:47.320 --> 13:48.548
YOU SHOULD CALL HIM.

13:48.590 --> 13:49.682
WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:49.720 --> 13:52.325
HE JUST MENTION THAT HE'S
BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.918
HE HAS.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.393
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT TO JAKE.

13:55.430 --> 13:56.328
I SPENT OUR FIRST THREE DATES

13:56.360 --> 13:58.169
TRYING TO CONVINCE HIM
THAT I WAS AVAILABLE,

13:58.200 --> 14:00.498
AND NOW 1--
NOW I FINALLY FEEL LIKE I AM.

14:01.570 --> 14:03.106
WHAT IS THAT?

14:03.140 --> 14:04.300
A BUTTON.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.399
DO YOU THINK IT
BELONGS TO RED COAT?

14:07.410 --> 14:09.207
( rustling )

14:16.520 --> 14:18.249
( exhales sharply)

14:18.290 --> 14:20.315
HI._SORRY I'M LATE.
(Ana and Emily Sigh )

14:20.360 --> 14:23.181
YEAH, SO ARE WE.
YOU COULD'VE
ANNOUNCED YOURSELF.

14:23.230 --> 14:26.085
HI, I'M SPENCER.
I'M CLIMBING
INTO THE CRAWLSPACE.

14:26.130 --> 14:27.199
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

14:27.230 --> 14:28.629
I WAS WITH TOBY.
JUST--

14:28.660 --> 14:29.820
STUFF'S GOING ON.

14:29.860 --> 14:32.624
YEAH, THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON
FOR A WHILE NOW,

14:32.670 --> 14:34.592
EVER SINCE HE GAVE "A"
THAT LAIR.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.232
HAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING?

14:36.270 --> 14:37.237
A BUTTON.

14:37.270 --> 14:38.305
LEMME SEE.

14:39.470 --> 14:42.177
( wood creaking )
TOLD YOU SHE
HAS THE BEST FLASHLIGHT.

14:42.210 --> 14:44.041
( thudding )

14:44.080 --> 14:46.298
( creaking continues )

14:46.350 --> 14:49.672
( footsteps )
( whispering ) I thought
Mrs. D. was with Hanna.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.210
UH--

14:54.720 --> 14:56.984
( phone dialing )

15:00.400 --> 15:02.960
( footsteps continuing )

15:06.330 --> 15:08.890
( phone vibrating )

15:14.480 --> 15:16.471
( sighing )

15:30.330 --> 15:32.218
( all gasping )

15:35.730 --> 15:37.698
( all whimpering )

15:37.730 --> 15:38.662
SHH.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.061
( footsteps )

15:46.570 --> 15:49.937
( door opens, shuts )

15:50.750 --> 15:52.945
( breathing heavily)

15:57.150 --> 15:58.742
WAIT, GO BACK.
HOW MANY KNITTING NEEDLES
WERE THERE?

15:58.790 --> 16:00.109
DOES THERE NEED TO BE
MORE THAN ONE?

16:00.160 --> 16:02.754
I'M JUST SAYING
THERE COULD HAVE BEEN
MORE THAN ONE PERSON UP THERE.

16:02.790 --> 16:04.724
THERE WAS ONE PERSON,
ONE HEAW-FOOTED PERSON

16:04.760 --> 16:06.455
WHO KNEW EXACTLY
WHERE THOSE HOLES WERE.

16:06.490 --> 16:08.128
EM, THIS COULD HELP US.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.469
IF THAT PERSON IS CECE,
WE CAN TRAP HER--

16:10.500 --> 16:13.196
MAYBE WITH THE DIVA DISH
ENVELOPE; WHEN YOU
GO BACK THERE, YOU SHOULD--

16:13.240 --> 16:15.367
IF I GO BACK THERE,
IT'S TO PACK UP
MY SUITCASE, OKAY?

16:15.400 --> 16:17.163
I'M NOT SLEEPING
IN THAT HOUSE AGAIN.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.201
I'LL MOVE IN HERE.
MOVING IN WHERE?

16:19.240 --> 16:21.208
HERE. YOUR BEDROOM,
THIS COUCH--

16:21.240 --> 16:22.468
ANYWHERE WHERE
THERE'S CARPETING.

16:22.510 --> 16:24.102
DO YOU WANNA DO THIS TONIGHT?

16:24.150 --> 16:25.640
YEAH.
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

16:25.680 --> 16:26.442
UH...

16:26.480 --> 16:28.471
WHO WERE YOU
TALKING TO UPSTAIRS?

16:28.520 --> 16:30.681
TOBY. WHY?
WHAT DID I MISS?

16:31.690 --> 16:33.453
WHAT DID WE MISS?

16:33.490 --> 16:35.685
SPENCE, IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE LIVING A DOUBLE LIFE.

16:35.720 --> 16:38.154
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'M LIVING A DOUBLE LIFE?

16:38.190 --> 16:40.750
BECAUSE I HAVE
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.224
EVERY TIME TOBY CALLS,
YOU LEAVE THE ROOM,
YOUR MOOD CHANGES.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.692
ARE YOU PREGNANT?
SHUT UP, HANNA.

16:45.730 --> 16:47.630
OKAY, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
HERE BUT YOU'RE NOT.

16:47.670 --> 16:49.729
WE GET IT. WE UNDERSTAND
YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

16:49.770 --> 16:50.759
WE'VE ALL HAD THEM.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.370
YEAH, EVEN EMILY.
SHUT UP, HANNA.

16:53.410 --> 16:55.776
OKAY BUT WE DON'T PUT ANYONE
ABOVE OUR FRIENDSHIP.

16:55.810 --> 16:57.471
I'M NOT PUTTING HIM
ABOVE YOU GUYS.

16:57.510 --> 16:58.738
I JUST--TOBY IS--

16:58.780 --> 17:01.715
HE'S DEALING WITH SOME
REALLY SERIOUS STUFF.

17:01.750 --> 17:02.819
SPENCER,

17:02.850 --> 17:05.318
HANNA'S MOM MIGHT BE
GOING TO PRISON, LIKE, FOR REAL.

17:05.350 --> 17:07.215
EMILY'S GOT A CAR
PARKED IN HER LIVING ROOM,

17:07.260 --> 17:08.784
AND I NEARLY LOST AN EYE
THIS AFTERNOON.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.583
I THINK...
ALL OF OUR STUFF

17:10.630 --> 17:12.279
RANKS ON THE "SERIOUS"
CHARTS.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.118
( stammers )
I PROMISED HIM.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.320
WE KNOW.

17:17.330 --> 17:19.161
Hanna: SPENCE,
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

17:19.200 --> 17:21.088
IS TOBY WORKING
WITH "A" AGAIN?

17:21.140 --> 17:22.368
NO.

17:23.870 --> 17:26.236
BUT "A" IS GIVING HIM
GIFTS, TOO.

17:29.740 --> 17:32.208
TOBY'S MOTHER
MIGHT HAVE BEEN MURDERED.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.559
YEAH, I KNOW HE'S NOT WELL.
YOU TOLD ME THAT EARLIER.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.727
IT IS JUST A QUICK QUESTION!

17:46.160 --> 17:48.299
COULD YOU PLEASE
JUST GET SOMEONE

17:48.330 --> 17:50.525
TO GET DR. PALMER
ON THE PHONE?

17:53.500 --> 17:56.298
FINE, THANKS.
YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.107
( phone beeps )

17:59.140 --> 18:01.074
( phone chimes )

18:15.720 --> 18:17.722
( indistinct chattering )

18:22.760 --> 18:24.318
( sighs )

18:37.250 --> 18:39.138
Ezra:
WELL, AT LEAST I KNOW

18:39.180 --> 18:40.442
YOU DIDN'T LOSE IT.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.640
OR THROW IT IN THE RIVER.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.648
YEAH. UM...

18:44.890 --> 18:47.381
I'M SORRY, EZRA.
THINGS HAVE JUST BEEN...

18:47.420 --> 18:48.614
PRETTY BUSY.

18:48.660 --> 18:49.615
NO WORRIES.

18:49.660 --> 18:51.423
YOU'RE HERE NOW.

18:51.460 --> 18:52.779
TRUE.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.252
UM...

18:55.300 --> 18:57.188
I-I CAN'T REALLY
TALK RIGHT NOW.

18:57.230 --> 18:59.266
W--IS THERE ANOTHER TIME

18:59.300 --> 19:00.289
WE CAN GET TOGETHER?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.194
I HAVE SOMETHING I--

19:02.240 --> 19:04.765
WOULD RATHER NOT SAY IT
OVER THE PHONE.

19:07.910 --> 19:09.605
HEY.
Aria: HI!

19:09.640 --> 19:11.471
UM, I-I JUST SAT DOWN

19:11.510 --> 19:12.499
AND THEN I SAW EZRA FROM--

19:12.550 --> 19:14.916
UM, EZRA, THIS IS JAKE.

19:14.950 --> 19:15.917
JAKE, EZRA.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.913
YEAH, YOU TOO.

19:21.790 --> 19:24.281
Ezra: SO I SHOULD
ACTUALLY GET GOING.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.729
I'VE GOT A LOT
OF WORK TO DO.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.853
BUT...IT WAS NICE
METING YOU.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.299
MMM.

19:31.730 --> 19:32.958
Aria: WOW, THAT WAS WEIRD.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.264
I--I HAD NO IDEA
THAT HE WAS GONNA BE HERE.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.335
DON'T SWEAT IT.

19:36.370 --> 19:38.429
IT'S A...SMALL TOWN.

19:41.940 --> 19:43.441
WHAT'S THIS?

19:43.480 --> 19:45.175
OPEN IT.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.584
YOU DID NOT BUY ME--
TRY 'EM ON.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.287
HERE?

19:57.330 --> 19:59.184
YEAH. I'LL HELP YOU.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.839
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
HOW'D YOU KNOW MY SIZE?

20:08.870 --> 20:10.861
IT'S A GIFT.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.231
AND A GREAT PARTY TRICK.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.739
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

20:23.490 --> 20:25.515
I THINK PEOPLE
ARE STARING AT US.

20:25.550 --> 20:27.450
THE BOOT.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.622
IT'S PERFECT.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.359
( chuckles )

20:37.330 --> 20:38.991
TOBY CAN'T TRUST "A" ANYMORE.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.339
I MADE THAT REALLY CLEAR.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.997
HOW CAN I HELP?

20:43.040 --> 20:46.009
UM, JUST GRAB MY STUFF
IN THE BATHROOM.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.598
OH, AND CHECK THE SHOWER.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.834
YEAH.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.599
( phone chimes )

20:52.980 --> 20:54.345
( phone beeps )

21:02.020 --> 21:03.578
( sighs )

21:18.870 --> 21:21.634
* LEAVE IT ALONE

21:23.380 --> 21:25.041
STOP MOVING.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.071
I CAN'T HELP IT.
IT TICKLES.

21:27.110 --> 21:28.646
GET OVER IT.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.682
( music continues
indistinctly )

21:33.660 --> 21:35.514
*GO

21:35.560 --> 21:37.824
YOU NEED TO BREAK UP
WITH BEN.
WHAT?

21:37.860 --> 21:39.350
WHY?

21:39.390 --> 21:40.755
BECAUSE YOU DESERVE BETTER.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.825
HE'S A FLATHEAD.
AND DEEP DOWN,

21:42.860 --> 21:44.464
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.058
SOMETIMES IT FEELS RIGHT.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.636
( scoffs )
PLEASE.

21:47.670 --> 21:49.069
MUSHY SQUASH.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.863
HE'S NOT THAT BAD.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.105
THAT'S WHAT'S LEFT
ON THE BUFFET TABLE

21:53.140 --> 21:55.529
AFTER EVERYONE'S
MADE THEIR CHOICES, EM.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.036
YOU DON'T MAKE DECISIONS,

21:57.080 --> 21:58.809
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU'LL END UP WITH.

21:58.850 --> 22:00.545
BEN REALLY CARES ABOUT ME.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.070
AND I DON'T
WANT TO HURT HIM.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.680
STOP TAKING CARE
OF EVERYONE BUT YOURSELF.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.814
ALISON--
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL
AT WHAT YOU'RE GOOD AT, HON,

22:07.860 --> 22:10.454
'CAUSE YOU'LL SPEND THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE DOING IT.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.825
AND IF YOU NEED ME
TO DO THE DEED, I'M HAPPY TO.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.088
WHAT "DEED"?

22:15.130 --> 22:17.018
BREAKING UP WITH BEN.

22:17.060 --> 22:19.096
I'VE DONE IT
FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.688
THAT'S SO WRONG.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.958
WHO WOULD ASK YOU
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.639
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

22:25.670 --> 22:27.001
FRIEND OF MINE WAS INVOLVED

22:27.040 --> 22:29.099
WITH THIS REALLY SCARY DUDE.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.745
SHE COULDN'T DO IT,
SO I STEPPED IN.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.748
BUT THE BITCH DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT HE HAD A GUN--

22:33.780 --> 22:35.111
WHICH HE PULLED ON ME.

22:35.150 --> 22:36.913
WHAT?! WHO!

22:36.950 --> 22:38.986
A BOY AT OUR SCHOOL
HAS A GUN?

22:39.020 --> 22:40.112
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.981
HE DOESN'T
GO TO OUR SCHOOL...

22:42.960 --> 22:45.087
ANYMORE.

22:45.130 --> 22:46.757
OTHER FOOT.

22:50.530 --> 22:52.566
Spencer: HEY.
THIS IS EVERYTHING.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.099
WHAT'S WRONG?

22:56.140 --> 22:58.165
DID YOU KNOW THAT ALI
ONCE HAD A GUN PULLED ON HER?

22:58.210 --> 23:01.475
WHAT?
ALI USED TO HELP PEOPLE
BREAK UP WITH THEIR BOYFRIENDS

23:01.510 --> 23:03.102
WHEN THE DIDN'T WANT
TO DEAL WITH IT THEMSELVES.

23:03.140 --> 23:05.449
WHAT IF THAT WAS A FAVOR
SHE DID FOR CECE,

23:05.480 --> 23:07.038
AND THAT CREEPY DUDE
WAS WILDEN?

23:07.080 --> 23:08.479
WHOA, EMILY, SLOW DOWN.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.976
NO, W-WHEN I SAW THAT PHOTO

23:10.020 --> 23:12.181
OF WILDEN WITH HIS ARMS
AROUND ALI AND CECE,

23:12.220 --> 23:14.586
I ASSUMED THAT
HE WAS SEEING ALI.

23:14.620 --> 23:17.487
WHAT IF CECE WAS DATING JASON
AND WILDEN?

23:17.530 --> 23:18.679
SO WHAT IF SHE WAS?

23:18.730 --> 23:20.083
MAYBE WHEN SHE
CAME BACK TO ROSEWOOD,

23:20.130 --> 23:21.222
HE TRIED
TO HOOK UP WITH HER,

23:21.260 --> 23:23.148
AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID
OF HIM WAS TO KILL HIM?

23:32.940 --> 23:34.202
CeCe: HELLO?

23:34.240 --> 23:35.935
WHERE ARE YOU?

23:35.980 --> 23:37.868
I'M NOT WAITING HERE
FOREVER.

23:37.910 --> 23:38.808
AND I SURE AS HELL

23:38.850 --> 23:41.410
AM NOT GOING BACK
TO ROSEWOOD.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.817
CALL ME.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.551
* GOT A LITTLE BOOM
IN MY BIG TRUCK *

23:54.600 --> 23:56.693
* GONNA OPEN UP THE DOORS
AND TURN IT UP *

23:56.730 --> 23:59.062
* GONNA STOP MY BOOTS
IN THE GEORGIA MUD *

23:59.100 --> 24:01.034
* GONNA WATCH YOU MAKE ME
FALL IN LOVE *

24:01.070 --> 24:03.664
* GET UP ON THE HOOD
OF MY DADDY'S TRACTOR *

24:03.710 --> 24:05.837
* UP ON THE TOOLBOX,
IT DON'T MATTER *

24:05.870 --> 24:08.031
* DOWN ON THE TAILGATE,
GIRL, I CAN'T WAIT *

24:08.080 --> 24:09.399
* TO WATCH YOU
DO YOUR THING *

24:09.440 --> 24:12.671
* SHAKE IT FOR THE YOUNG BUCKS
SITTIN' IN THE HONKY-TONKS *

24:12.710 --> 24:14.746
* FOR THE REDNECKS ROCKIN'
TILL THE BRET-IK OF DAWN *

24:14.780 --> 24:16.611
SHOULD'VE COME HERE
ON HORSEBACK.

24:16.650 --> 24:19.016
OH, COME ON.
GO WITH IT, HAN.

24:20.120 --> 24:21.189
WELL,

24:21.220 --> 24:22.619
WHAT'LL IT BE, MA'AM?

24:22.660 --> 24:24.719
'CAN I GET YOU A NICE,
TALL GLASS

24:24.760 --> 24:26.022
OF SARSAPARILLA?

24:26.060 --> 24:28.119
( both chuckling )

24:32.700 --> 24:34.258
Travis: DO YOU WANNA DANCE?

24:34.300 --> 24:36.234
( sighs )
WHAT?

24:37.540 --> 24:38.837
DANCE WITH ME.

24:38.870 --> 24:40.201
OKAY, ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

24:40.240 --> 24:42.037
WHY WOULD I WANNA
DANCE WITH YOU?

24:42.080 --> 24:44.640
BECAUSE I PUT THAT ENVELOPE
IN YOUR LOCKER.

24:46.150 --> 24:47.970
I KNOW YOUR MOM'S INNOCENT.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.217
( gasps )

24:55.690 --> 24:56.884
WHO ARE YOU?

24:56.920 --> 24:58.524
I WAS AT THE LAKE
THAT NIGHT.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.027
WILDEN CALLED US
TO TOW HIS CAR OUT.

25:00.060 --> 25:02.756
LOOK, MY FAMILY OWNS THE GARAGE
ON THE CORNER OF BROADMOOR
AND LASHER.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.722
WAIT, YOU WERE AT THE LAKE
THAT NIGHT?

25:04.770 --> 25:07.022
YEAH, YOUR MOM WAS THERE
TALKING TO WILDEN.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.595
SHE DIDN'T SEE ME,
BUT I SAW HER DRIVE OFF.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.133
( sighs )
I HEARD GUNSHOTS...

25:13.170 --> 25:15.775
AFTER I SAW YOUR MOM
DRIVE AWAY.

25:15.810 --> 25:17.744
AND I SAW SOMEONE
RUNNING THROUGH THE WOODS.

25:17.780 --> 25:19.600
WHO? WHO DID YOU SEE?

25:19.650 --> 25:21.311
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT WAS A GIRL.

25:21.350 --> 25:23.147
Caleb:
HEY, HANNA.

25:23.180 --> 25:26.081
YOU, UH, HATE THIS,
WE CAN SWITCH.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.850
I GOT LEMONADE, SO...

25:28.890 --> 25:31.552
UM, ACTUALLY CAN YOU
HOLD THAT FOR ONE SECOND?

25:31.590 --> 25:32.579
I JUST--

25:32.630 --> 25:34.655
I HAVE TO DANCE WITH--
TRAVIS.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.850
YEAH. H--ONE OF ARIA'S...

25:36.900 --> 25:39.892
BROTHER'S FRIENDS
FROM LACROSSE.

25:39.930 --> 25:41.033
IT WAS A BET.

25:41.070 --> 25:43.664
SO, COME ON, TRAVIS.
LET'S DANCE.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.905
* THERE'S
A LITTLE MOONLIGHT *

25:46.910 --> 25:48.138
* DANCING ON THE SAND

25:48.180 --> 25:50.136
WHY'D YOU WAIT SO LONG?

25:50.180 --> 25:51.943
IT'S COM PLICATED.

25:51.980 --> 25:53.811
I KNOW COMPLICATED.

25:53.850 --> 25:56.569
LOOK, MY DAD AND WILDEN--
THERE'S BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THEM.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.110
MY DAD COULD'VE
LOOKED JUST AS GUILTY

25:59.150 --> 26:00.310
AS YOUR MOM LOOKS NOW.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.181
THAT STILL DOESN'T
GET YOU OFF THE HOOK.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.688
IT WAS ME AND A DEAD BODY.
WHO'S GONNA BELIEVE ME
WHEN I SAY I SAW SOMEONE

26:04.730 --> 26:06.220
RUNNING THROUGH THE WOODS?

26:06.260 --> 26:08.649
WAS THAT SOMEBODY A BLONDE?

26:08.700 --> 26:10.827
IT WAS VERY DARK,
BUT I THINK SO.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.189
WHERE'D THE CASH COME FROM?

26:12.230 --> 26:14.061
WHEN I SAW HIS BODY, I--

26:14.100 --> 26:16.830
I PANICKED.
I LEFT MY TRUCK AT THE LAKE.

26:16.870 --> 26:18.633
THEN IT SHOWED UP LATER
AT THE GARAGE.

26:18.670 --> 26:20.137
THAT ENVELOPE
WAS ON THE SEAT,

26:20.170 --> 26:22.104
SO WHOEVER DELIVERED THAT
THOUGHT IT WOULD SHUT ME UP.

26:22.140 --> 26:23.107
WELL IT DID.

26:23.140 --> 26:24.607
* IF I LEAVE MY HEART

26:24.650 --> 26:26.208
* WITH YOU TONIGHT

26:26.250 --> 26:27.877
* WILL YOU PROMISE ME

26:27.920 --> 26:31.310
* THAT YOU'RE
GONNA TREAT IT RIGHT? *

26:32.320 --> 26:34.356
HOWDY, CALEB.
HOW'S IT GOING?

26:34.390 --> 26:35.186
WHAT ARE THEY SERVING?

26:35.220 --> 26:37.256
UH, I WOULD JUST
STICK WITH WATER.

26:37.290 --> 26:39.679
EVERYTHING ELSE
TASTES LIKE COUGH SYRUP.
WHERE'S HANNA?

26:39.730 --> 26:42.699
SHE'S DANCING OFF SOME BET
WITH ONE OF YOUR BROTHER'S
TEAMMATES.

26:42.730 --> 26:44.664
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT?

26:44.700 --> 26:48.238
OH--YEAH,
MIKE IS SO IMMATURE.
( scoffs )

26:48.270 --> 26:49.339
I'LL HAVE A WATER.

26:49.370 --> 26:50.359
PLEASE.

26:54.810 --> 26:56.209
IT'S NOT AS HARD
AS IT LOOKS.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.105
MY FATHER TAUGHT ME
HOW TO TWO-STEP.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.242
HE LEARNED AT THE BASE.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.748
IN TEXAS, IT'S PART
OF BASIC TRAINING.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.111
( chuckles )
WELL WE SHOULD ALL BE DRAFl'ED

27:03.150 --> 27:06.244
BECAUSE I DON'T
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A TWO-STEP AND A POLKA.

27:06.290 --> 27:07.382
BUT. . .YOU'LL LEAD,

27:07.420 --> 27:08.387
RIGHT, TOBY?

27:08.420 --> 27:10.012
SURE.

27:10.060 --> 27:11.948
WHAT'S A POLKA?
( chuckles )

27:11.990 --> 27:14.390
* IF I LEAVE MY HEART

27:14.430 --> 27:16.250
* WITH YOU TONIGHT

27:16.300 --> 27:18.427
* WILL YOU PROMISE ME
GIRL, YOU'RE GONNA
TREAT IT RIGHT? *

27:18.470 --> 27:20.893
DID YOU KNOW THAT PAIGE
WAS GONNA BE HERE?

27:20.940 --> 27:22.669
UM, SORTA.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.930
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT I WAS, THOUGH.

27:26.940 --> 27:30.706
* SO IF I FALL

27:30.750 --> 27:33.639
* CAN YOU
LET ME DOWN EASY? *

27:34.920 --> 27:38.845
* IF I FALL

27:38.890 --> 27:39.709
I DON'T GET IT.

27:39.750 --> 27:41.809
IF YOU WERE SO SCARED
OF LOOKING GUILTY,

27:41.860 --> 27:43.418
WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE YOUR
TRUCK AT THE LAKE?

27:43.460 --> 27:44.449
I-I FREAKED OUT, OKAY?

27:44.490 --> 27:45.252
IT WAS STUPID, I KNOW.

27:45.290 --> 27:47.019
BUT I CAN'T
HIDE THAT MONEY ANYMORE.

27:47.060 --> 27:48.027
YOUR MOM NEEDS IT.

27:48.060 --> 27:49.027
NO.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.766
YOU HAVE TO SPEAK
TO THE POLICE.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.324
LOOK, I-I'M NOT GONNA
SELL OUT MY OWN FAMILY

27:52.370 --> 27:53.519
TO SAVE YOURS.

27:53.570 --> 27:55.993
ALL RIGHT, THE POLICE SHOULD'VE
FIGURED THIS OUT BY NOW.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.098
WELL THEY HAVEN'T!

27:57.140 --> 27:58.767
AND NOW THEY
HAVE PHYSICAL PROOF

27:58.810 --> 28:00.209
THAT MY MOM WAS THERE
AT THE LAKE THAT NIGHT.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.037
AND SHE'S LOOKING GUILTIER
EVERY MINUTE.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.945
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

28:05.050 --> 28:06.972
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING
THAT I'M GONNA DO.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.345
( song ends )
( crowd applauding
and cheering)

28:13.960 --> 28:15.257
( new song begins )

28:15.290 --> 28:16.917
Girl: YEE-HAW!

28:22.760 --> 28:25.968
* TAKE ME
BACK TO THE MUDDY WATER *

28:26.000 --> 28:28.798
* WHERE THE BULL AND THE COW
DON'T BOTHER *

28:28.840 --> 28:31.365
* PICK UP A GIRL
I KNOW WON'T HOLLER *

28:31.410 --> 28:33.935
* HEAD OUT OF TOWN,
WATCH THE SUN GO DOWN *

28:33.980 --> 28:36.778
* MAYBE LATER WE'LL
CALL SOME FRIENDS *

28:36.810 --> 28:39.244
* TELL 'EM, "MEET US
WHERE THE PAVEMENT ENDS" *

28:43.150 --> 28:45.345
* I GOT SOME FAT WOOD

28:45.390 --> 28:46.812
* ROLLING IN THE TRUCK BED

28:46.850 --> 28:49.216
* FINE PINE,
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID *

28:49.260 --> 28:51.478
* FOUND IT IN THE FOREST
WHERE THE KINDLIN' STRONG *

28:51.530 --> 28:54.226
* IT BURNS REAL HOT
BUT IT DON'T LAST LONG *

28:54.260 --> 28:56.899
* JUST 'CAUSE I GOT HER WARM
DON'T MEAN I'LL SEE SKIN *

28:56.930 --> 28:59.797
* BUT I'M GONNA START A FIRE
WHERE THE PAVEMENT ENDS *

29:01.300 --> 29:04.758
* YOU CAN GET A BUZZ,
BLAME IT ON THE RADIO *

29:04.810 --> 29:07.028
* FIND THE LIGHTER,
LIVE A LITTLE HIGHER *

29:07.070 --> 29:11.507
* TAKE IT ALL IN,
LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL *

29:11.550 --> 29:13.848
* AND ON A CLEAR NIGHT

29:13.880 --> 29:15.211
* WHO NEEDS THE HEADLIGHTS

29:15.250 --> 29:18.117
* DROP IT IN "LOW,"
DRIVE BY THE MOONLIGHT *

29:18.150 --> 29:20.186
* OUT HERE THE WORLD
DON'T SPIN *

29:20.220 --> 29:23.018
* EVERYTHING STOPS
WHERE THE PAVEMENT ENDS *

29:32.130 --> 29:33.836
* DROP ME OFF

29:33.870 --> 29:35.428
* ON HOMEGROWN RED CLAY

29:35.470 --> 29:38.268
* WHERE THE DEER
AND THE 'POSSUM DO PLAY *

29:38.310 --> 29:39.402
* TURN OFF THE PHONE

29:39.440 --> 29:40.976
* IT'S NEVER TOO LATE

29:41.010 --> 29:43.274
* TO CAST A LINE,
CATCH SOME PEACE OF MIND *

29:43.310 --> 29:45.540
* LIFE'S TOO FAST TO RUN,
MY FRIEND *

29:45.580 --> 29:47.571
* SLOW IT ON DOWN
WHERE THE PAVEMENT ENDS *

29:47.610 --> 29:49.874
SO THIS KID
FALLS OUT OF THE SKY NOW?

29:49.920 --> 29:52.138
HANNA, "A"
DELIVERED THAT TRUCK.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.010
"A" PUT THAT MONEY
IN THERE.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.278
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS KID
ISN'T WORKING FOR "A"?

29:57.420 --> 29:58.387
* EVERYTHING STOPS

29:58.430 --> 30:00.159
* WHERE THE PAVEMENT ENDS

30:00.190 --> 30:01.999
Caleb: HOW CAN YOU
TRUST THIS GUY?

30:02.030 --> 30:03.429
( song ends )
YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:03.460 --> 30:06.258
I CAN'T.
( crowd cheering
and whooping )

30:06.300 --> 30:08.291
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.331
( new song begins )

30:14.440 --> 30:17.944
* MY LOVER'S GONE
AND DONE ME WRONG *

30:18.950 --> 30:21.145
( music continues
indistinctly )

30:25.290 --> 30:26.917
WAN NA DANCE?

30:26.950 --> 30:28.588
( chuckles softly)

30:28.620 --> 30:29.985
SURE.

30:31.060 --> 30:34.029
* SHE PACKED UP
AND LEFT ME *

30:34.060 --> 30:36.290
* FOR SOME ONE NIGHT...

30:37.300 --> 30:38.824
HEY, THERE.

30:39.670 --> 30:41.194
HI.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.390
JAKE,
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

30:43.440 --> 30:46.068
YOU COULD START BY GIVING US
A LITTLE BIT MORE SPACE.

30:47.070 --> 30:48.537
I'M SORRY?

30:48.580 --> 30:51.572
I'M GUESSING BEING A CHAPERONE
WASN'T MANDATORY TONIGHT.

30:53.110 --> 30:56.273
NOW YOU GOTTA HAVE BETTER THINGS
TO DO ON A FRIDAY NIGHT, DUDE.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.288
LOOK, IF YOU THINK I'M HERE

30:58.320 --> 30:59.412
BECAUSE--

30:59.450 --> 31:00.519
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.

31:01.620 --> 31:04.020
AND I KNOW WHY YOU'RE
HURTING, MAN...

31:04.060 --> 31:06.927
BUT YOU GOTTA
LET HER MOVE ON.

31:06.960 --> 31:09.997
* ANY FOOL,
I'D PLAY IT, TOO... *

31:11.000 --> 31:13.093
I'LL TAKE
TWO LEMONADES, PLEASE.

31:15.070 --> 31:17.561
( slow song playing )

31:23.010 --> 31:25.240
DID EMILY
SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?

31:25.280 --> 31:27.077
ABOUT WHAT?

31:27.110 --> 31:29.169
NOTHING.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.011
HEY, LOOK, IF YOU
DON'T WANNA DANCE, WE DON'T--

31:34.060 --> 31:35.118
NO, NO, NO.
I DO. I DO.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.559
JUST--

31:37.660 --> 31:39.981
I GOT AN ADDRESS NOW
FOR PALMER'S CAR

31:40.030 --> 31:41.224
AND I WANNA GO THERE.

31:41.260 --> 31:43.023
WHAT?
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

31:44.100 --> 31:45.658
IT'S LESS THAN TWO MILES
AWAY FROM HERE,

31:45.700 --> 31:47.258
AND IF--IF THOSE
LAST SESSIONS

31:47.300 --> 31:48.369
WITH MY MOTHER ARE IN THERE--

31:50.400 --> 31:52.163
ANOTHER GIFT?

31:52.210 --> 31:53.939
TOBY, WHO ARE YOU HERE WITH,

31:53.980 --> 31:55.106
ME OR "A"?

31:55.140 --> 31:57.233
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KEEP ME
FROM KNOWING THE TRUTH?

31:57.280 --> 31:59.043
IT'S LIKE I BRING THIS UP
AND I GET SHUT DOWN.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.707
NO, I'M NOT
SHUTTING YOU DOWN, OKAY?

32:00.750 --> 32:02.672
I JUST DON'T WANNA SEE THIS
THING BLOW UP IN YOUR FACE.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.938
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
NO, YOU DON'T.

32:04.990 --> 32:06.639
THAT'S THE THING.
NONE OF US DO.

32:06.690 --> 32:08.612
OKAY, WE'RE ALL JUST TRYING
TO MAKE THIS UP AS WE GO ALONG,

32:08.660 --> 32:10.480
BUT EVERYBODY THINKS
THAT YOU'RE PLAYING WITH F--

32:10.520 --> 32:12.056
WHOA, WHOA.

32:12.090 --> 32:13.557
WHO'S "EVERYBODY"?

32:13.590 --> 32:15.421
WHO ELSE
KNOWS ABOUT MY MOTHER?

32:16.700 --> 32:18.361
DID YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS?

32:20.470 --> 32:22.028
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

32:22.070 --> 32:24.300
NOW THAT--THAT
WILL BE THE LAST TEXT

32:24.340 --> 32:25.568
THAT I EVER GET.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.305
THAT'S FOR THE BEST.

32:27.340 --> 32:29.501
OKAY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO--
I TRUSTED YOU.

32:29.540 --> 32:31.542
I KNOW.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.707
BUT KEEPING THIS A SECRET HAS
MEANT THAT I'VE HAD TO CHOOSE

32:33.750 --> 32:34.717
BETWEEN YOU AND THEM.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.308
RIGHT.

32:36.350 --> 32:37.578
AND YOU CHOSE THEM.

32:37.620 --> 32:40.145
* WISH I COULD TELL YOU

32:41.160 --> 32:44.220
* WORDS CAN'T BE FOUND

32:45.230 --> 32:50.224
* WHENEVER YOU COME AROUND

32:51.230 --> 32:55.769
* I GET WEAK IN THE KNEES

32:55.800 --> 32:58.007
* AND I LOSE MY BREATH

33:02.380 --> 33:03.631
( slow country song playing )

33:03.680 --> 33:04.772
Spencer: HEY.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.402
HEY, DID YOU DRIVE HERE?

33:06.450 --> 33:08.179
YEAH. WHY?
DO YOU NEED A RIDE?

33:08.220 --> 33:09.414
NO, I NEED YOU TO FOLLOW TOBY.

33:09.450 --> 33:12.317
HERE, JUST GIMME
THOSE PLATES, OKAY?
I'LL FEED HANNA.
YEAH.

33:12.350 --> 33:13.612
W-WHAT IS GOING ON?

33:13.650 --> 33:15.049
I THINK "A's"
TRYING TO SET HIM UP.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.684
BUT I NEED YOU TO GO NOW,
QUICK, BEFORE HE PULLS OUT
OF THE LOT, PLEASE.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.529
GO.
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

33:21.260 --> 33:25.594
* WHENEVER YOU COME AROUND

33:29.270 --> 33:30.692
Aria: HEY.

33:30.740 --> 33:33.402
WHO WAS THAT GUY
HANNA WAS DANCING
WITH EARLIER?

33:33.440 --> 33:35.101
I DIDN'T SEE HIM.

33:35.140 --> 33:36.732
UH, HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO EZRA?

33:36.780 --> 33:39.101
UM, NO.

33:39.150 --> 33:40.469
HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

33:40.510 --> 33:42.375
YEAH, EMILY, I KNOW.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.479
I JUST DON'T WANT A REPEAT
OF THIS AFTERNOON.

33:44.520 --> 33:47.239
WE HAD THE WEIRDEST PILE-UP
TODAY AT THE BREW.

33:47.290 --> 33:48.211
I MEAN, EZRA JUST--

33:48.260 --> 33:51.058
HE LOOKED LIKE THIS WET,
SAD PUPPY, AND JAKE--

33:51.090 --> 33:52.250
DID YOU EVER EVEN CALL HIM?

33:52.290 --> 33:54.121
I CAN'T, EMILY
I TOLD YOU.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.253
HOW IS JAKE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
THAT IT'S REALLY OVER?

33:56.300 --> 33:57.722
OKAY, THIS ISN'T ABOUT JAKE.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.523
HE'S LOSING MALCOLM.

33:59.570 --> 34:01.162
FIRST HE LOSES YOU,

34:01.200 --> 34:03.794
AND NOW MAGGIE'S MOVING HIS KID
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.762
HE'S IN A REALLY BAD PLACE.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.698
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT?

34:31.170 --> 34:33.764
( metal rattling )

34:42.340 --> 34:43.773
( breathes deeply,
clears throat )

34:43.810 --> 34:45.641
YOU LEFT
BEFORE WE COULD FINISH.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.438
I TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING I KNEW.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.516
THIS MONEY IS NOT
GONNA HELP MY MOM

34:50.550 --> 34:51.847
OR YOU.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.846
YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT
TO THE POLICE.

34:53.890 --> 34:55.448
DO NOT GIVE ME THAT.

34:55.490 --> 34:58.186
I KNOW HOW IT FEELS
TO BE BLACKMAILED.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.754
OKAY, YOU CAN'T WISH IT AWAY.

34:59.790 --> 35:02.190
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

35:02.230 --> 35:04.323
I'M NOT SELLING OUT
MY OWN DAD.

35:04.370 --> 35:05.792
TRAVIS, MY MOM

35:05.830 --> 35:08.435
STILL BELIEVES THAT THE TRUTH
WILL GET HER OUT OF THIS.

35:08.470 --> 35:11.132
AND YOU'RE
HOLDING THAT TRUTH.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.771
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.846
BUT YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE COME TO ME

35:20.880 --> 35:23.474
IF YOU WEREN'T READY
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

35:33.460 --> 35:35.894
( country music
playing indistinctly)

35:35.930 --> 35:37.488
HEY, WHERE THE HELL
IS HANNA?

35:37.530 --> 35:39.464
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I THINK I SAW "RED COAT."

35:39.500 --> 35:41.639
WHAT? WAIT, WHERE?
WAS IT CECE?

35:41.670 --> 35:43.763
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS A FLASH,
AND THEN SHE DISAPPEARED.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.768
I LOOKED UP FOR A SECOND
RIGHT OVER THERE.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.135
THERE SHE IS.

35:59.790 --> 36:02.418
I SEE SOMEONE...
HEADING DOWN THE MAIN ROAD.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.655
OH, EXCUSE ME.
CAN WE PLEASE
BORROW YOUR TRUCK?

36:04.690 --> 36:05.918
UH, NO.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.689
LAST HAY RIDE
IS AT 9:30.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.254
NO, NO, NO.
WE DON'T WANT A HAY RIDE.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.756
WE JUST--WE NEED
TO CATCH UP WITH OUR FRIEND.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.859
WELL I'M SORRY,
PIPPY LONGSTOCKING,

36:12.900 --> 36:14.936
BUT, UH,
I'M DONE FOR THE NIGHT.

36:19.810 --> 36:21.163
( sighs )

36:34.590 --> 36:36.285
EZRA, I'M SO SORRY.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.810
I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

36:37.860 --> 36:39.725
IT WAS EMILY WHO TOLD YOU?

36:39.760 --> 36:40.829
SHE HAD TO.

36:40.860 --> 36:41.895
UH--

36:41.930 --> 36:43.955
LOOK, I-I THOUGHT THAT YOU
WERE CALLING ME BECAUSE--

36:44.000 --> 36:45.422
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS NOW.

36:45.470 --> 36:46.698
NO, IF I WOULD'VE KNOWN--

36:46.730 --> 36:48.595
IT'S OKAY, ARIA.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.961
I HAVE NO RIGHT
TO BE INVADING YOUR LIFE
WITH MY PROBLEMS.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.331
YOU SHOULD GET BACK TO JAKE.

36:52.370 --> 36:53.462
( sighs )

36:54.940 --> 36:57.431
( clutch grinding )

36:58.450 --> 36:59.769
HURRY!

36:59.810 --> 37:02.347
I-I CAN'T GET IT
INTO FIRST GEAR.

37:02.380 --> 37:03.870
IS YOUR FOOT ON THE BRAKE?
NO, IT'S ON THE CLUTCH.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.480
( clutch grinding )

37:06.520 --> 37:08.852
OH!

37:08.890 --> 37:09.879
( lurching )

37:09.920 --> 37:12.627
( both panting )

37:14.360 --> 37:15.952
DO YOU WANNA TRY THIS?

37:16.000 --> 37:17.991
SERIOUSLY, THIS WAS NOT
ON MY DRIVER'S ED TEST.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.622
( engine stalls )

37:48.700 --> 37:50.520
( grunting )

37:58.640 --> 37:59.902
( gasping )

38:12.950 --> 38:14.781
( rustling )

38:14.820 --> 38:16.651
DON'T DO IT.

38:16.690 --> 38:17.714
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

38:17.760 --> 38:19.785
I'M STOPPING YOU FROM DOING
SOMETHING REALLY STUPID.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.127
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.924
ALL I KNOW IS THAT SPENCER
IS REALLY FREAKED OUT
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.723
I DON'T NEED AN INTERVENTION.

38:25.770 --> 38:27.795
JUST GO BACK TO THE PARTY.

38:27.830 --> 38:30.936
IF THIS HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH "A,"
THEN YOU NEED A REALITY CHECK.

38:33.070 --> 38:35.038
(vehicle approaching )

38:40.810 --> 38:43.608
( siren whooping )

38:47.720 --> 38:49.756
Lieutenant Tanner:
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE
MORE QUESTIONS.

38:49.790 --> 38:51.655
YOU REALIZE YOU WILL
HAVE TO REPEAT THIS

38:51.690 --> 38:53.885
OR YOU MIGHT HAVE TO REPEAT THIS
IN FRONT OF A JUDGE.

38:55.530 --> 38:57.452
( breathes deeply)
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.364
( sighs )

38:58.400 --> 39:00.129
DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD IDENTIFY THE PERSON

39:00.170 --> 39:02.092
YOU SAW RUNNING
THROUGH THE WOODS?

39:02.140 --> 39:04.608
I'M NOT SURE.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.965
BUT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE

39:08.010 --> 39:09.432
THAT YOU HEARD THE GUNSHOTS

39:09.480 --> 39:11.107
AFTER MRS. MARIN DROVE OFF?

39:11.140 --> 39:12.801
YES, MA'AM.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.114
SHE WASN'T THERE
WHEN HE WAS KILLED.

39:38.940 --> 39:40.931
( country music playing )

39:40.970 --> 39:42.073
THERE'S NOTHING.

39:42.110 --> 39:43.805
HEY, WELL AT LEAST
WE HAVE THAT.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.546
IS IT MISSING A BUTTON?

39:45.580 --> 39:47.571
YEP.

39:47.610 --> 39:48.872
LISTEN, I'M GONNA CALL TOBY.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.012
I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

39:50.050 --> 39:52.018
WELL SHE CAN'T
BE TWO PLACES AT ONCE.

39:52.050 --> 39:53.483
AND CECE WAS ALREADY HERE.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.385
YEAH, BUT WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE WENT.

39:57.220 --> 40:01.589
* 'CAUSE IT HURTS SO MUCH
TO BE ALONE *

40:03.200 --> 40:05.395
( indistinct chattering )

40:09.540 --> 40:12.031
( song ends )
( crowd cheering
and applauding )

40:16.140 --> 40:17.437
HEY.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.175
HEY.

40:19.210 --> 40:20.472
LOOK,

40:20.510 --> 40:24.014
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE PERSON
THAT ENDS UP WITH MUSHY SQUASH.

40:25.490 --> 40:26.787
ARE YOU DRUNK?

40:27.790 --> 40:28.814
NO.

40:30.090 --> 40:32.479
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

40:32.530 --> 40:34.896
I'M SAYING THAT
I WANNA DANCE WITH YOU.

40:34.930 --> 40:36.488
NOW.

40:36.530 --> 40:38.760
BEFORE THEY
TURN THE LIGHTS OFF.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.638
* I FINALLY
ASKED YOU TO DANCE *

40:50.680 --> 40:53.001
* ON THE LAST SLOW SONG

40:54.950 --> 41:00.217
* BENEATH THAT MOON
THAT WAS REALLY A DISCO BALL *

41:01.250 --> 41:03.889
* I CAN STILL FEEL

41:03.920 --> 41:07.856
* MY HEAD ON YOUR SHOULDER

41:07.890 --> 41:10.825
* AND HOPING THAT SONG

41:10.860 --> 41:15.194
* WOULD NEVER BE OVER

41:15.240 --> 41:20.598
* I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN AGES *

41:21.880 --> 41:25.099
* SOMETIMES I FIND MYSELF

41:25.150 --> 41:28.972
* WONDERING
WHERE YOU ARE *

41:29.020 --> 41:34.014
* FOR ME YOU'LL
ALWAYS BE 18 *

41:35.020 --> 41:37.909
* AND BEAUTIFUL

41:37.960 --> 41:43.990
* AND DANCING AWAY
WITH MY HEART *

41:47.130 --> 41:49.496
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME.

41:50.340 --> 41:52.262
I WANTED TO.

41:54.040 --> 41:55.701
IS JAKE OUT THERE...

41:55.740 --> 41:56.968
WAITING FOR YOU?

41:57.010 --> 41:59.501
NO, HE DROPPED ME AT HOME.
I CAME BY MYSELF.

42:01.180 --> 42:03.216
WHAT HAPPENED WITH MALCOLM?

42:04.350 --> 42:05.715
( sighs )

42:05.750 --> 42:07.286
