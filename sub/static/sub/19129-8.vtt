WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:02.403
Previously on "The Path"...

00:02.436 --> 00:04.272
I won't let them
seize the compound.

00:04.305 --> 00:08.309
- No. We have to sell the...
- The center.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.453
- I have to watch Johnny now.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.112
- I could watch him.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.546
There was a man following us?

00:12.580 --> 00:14.148
- He wanted you to go with him.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.816
Next time we go to San Diego,

00:15.849 --> 00:18.119
we need to stop by Los Angeles.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.521
There is a very important donor

00:20.554 --> 00:22.090
we need to talk to.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.358
Noa... her mother's
some music mogul.

00:24.392 --> 00:28.196
- I'm never asking her
for anything ever again, Hawk.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.531
- To help Noa
live up to her potential,

00:30.564 --> 00:32.500
we need to help her mother.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.235
I had these tactics...

00:34.268 --> 00:35.803
First money, then candy,

00:35.836 --> 00:37.705
alcohol, drugs...

00:37.738 --> 00:39.507
You need a jump?
Hey, what are you...

00:44.845 --> 00:46.214
Eddie?

00:46.247 --> 00:47.748
Eddie?

01:30.458 --> 01:31.792
Eddie!

01:34.828 --> 01:36.730
*

01:36.764 --> 01:39.133
He's just a kid.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.370
Okay?

01:42.403 --> 01:43.904
A little boy!

01:43.937 --> 01:46.240
God, you can't do this!

01:46.274 --> 01:47.341
- It's already done.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.375
Submit.

01:50.578 --> 01:51.712
- Ugh! God!

01:52.780 --> 01:54.182
- Come on, man!

02:01.822 --> 02:03.657
- Is this who you are now?

02:03.691 --> 02:05.759
Huh? Is this what you do?

02:05.793 --> 02:07.661
- You have something
that belongs to us.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.663
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.665
Okay? I don't have anything!

02:11.699 --> 02:13.334
- What happened on the mountain?

02:13.367 --> 02:16.270
- You pushed Steve.
- Tell us!

02:16.304 --> 02:18.739
- This is Cal, isn't it?

02:18.772 --> 02:19.740
Huh? He's doing this?

02:19.773 --> 02:21.342
He's punishing me?

02:21.375 --> 02:23.211
Cal doesn't know
anything about this.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.446
Steve didn't become
one with The Light.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.516
This is very disturbing
for those of us who believe.

02:28.549 --> 02:31.519
We need to know
if you kept Steve

02:31.552 --> 02:33.554
from fulfilling his plan.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.589
- Look, let me just

02:35.623 --> 02:38.259
go get the kid,

02:38.292 --> 02:40.961
and then I will do
whatever you want!

02:40.994 --> 02:42.430
- First, take us back.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.432
- Take you back where?

02:44.465 --> 02:46.667
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

02:49.703 --> 02:56.310
*

02:56.344 --> 02:57.945
You dosed me.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.680
You dosed...

03:08.322 --> 03:09.923
You fucking dosed me.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.859
- If you won't
submit willingly...

03:13.527 --> 03:15.563
If you won't go willingly...

03:15.596 --> 03:17.665
- We'll guide you there.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.300
We'll guide you there.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.568
- Up the mountain.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.871
Up the mountain.

03:26.740 --> 03:31.379
* I've got light in places *

03:31.412 --> 03:34.515
* You didn't know
it could shine *

03:34.548 --> 03:38.986
* I've got light in places

03:39.019 --> 03:42.256
* You didn't know
it could shine *

03:42.290 --> 03:44.258
* I've got

03:44.292 --> 03:49.697
*

03:49.730 --> 03:50.964
* I've got

03:50.998 --> 03:57.938
*

04:06.814 --> 04:10.551
*

04:10.584 --> 04:11.819
- Jacqueline Richards?

04:11.852 --> 04:13.987
- Yeah. I go by Jackie.
- Yeah.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.290
- I'm Cal Roberts.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.427
This must be fate.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.329
I'm in town for 36 hours,
and I run into you.

04:21.362 --> 04:24.998
You're a woman that I have been
dying to thank in person.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.402
You contributed
on behalf of your daughter, Noa,

04:28.436 --> 04:29.703
to our cause.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.873
- Oh, you're one
of those Mayer people.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.543
- Meyerists. Yeah. Look.
- I have to say it's been...

04:35.576 --> 04:38.346
I don't know... it's been years
since I've come across a student

04:38.379 --> 04:40.013
as promising as your daughter.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.949
- That's great.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.016
That's really great.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.553
* I've got

04:45.586 --> 04:47.321
- I'm sorry. Did...

04:47.355 --> 04:48.722
Have I upset you?

04:48.756 --> 04:51.625
- No, no.
- I am fucking thrilled for her.

04:51.659 --> 04:55.028
Really. Thank you.
Thank you for stopping by.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.930
- Appreciate it.
- If I may, um,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.933
you don't seem thrilled for her.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.503
- Oh, no. I am.

05:02.536 --> 05:06.374
I am. It's not that.
It's me. It's...

05:06.407 --> 05:09.443
I just have all this...

05:09.477 --> 05:13.547
Stuff going on.

05:13.581 --> 05:16.083
I've lost someone kind of.

05:18.085 --> 05:21.589
Luna.
She's my biggest client.

05:23.757 --> 05:24.925
- Tell me.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.862
I love my wife so much.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.531
I come home sometimes
and just watch her

05:30.564 --> 05:32.800
through the window
before I open the door.

05:32.833 --> 05:36.704
And I'm, like...
I can't believe she married me.

05:36.737 --> 05:40.708
She's so beautiful and so kind.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.644
The love she has for me...

05:43.677 --> 05:46.880
So when I think
about who I really am,

05:46.914 --> 05:51.385
what I do, what I keep doing...

05:51.419 --> 05:53.454
if she knew who I really was...

06:08.168 --> 06:09.169
- Hello?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.804
- Is this Sarah Lane?

06:10.838 --> 06:12.440
- It is.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.717
You're listed
as an emergency contact

06:13.741 --> 06:14.875
for a patient of ours.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.577
Brenda Roberts?

06:16.610 --> 06:19.046
- Cal's mother. Yes?
- Is there something wrong?

06:19.079 --> 06:21.782
- Well, we've been unable
to reach him.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.418
He's traveling.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.886
- I'm sorry to say, uh,

06:25.919 --> 06:28.556
Brenda is suffering
from liver failure,

06:28.589 --> 06:30.758
and she's been placed
in hospice care.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.460
- How long does she have?

06:33.861 --> 06:35.596
- We don't like
to make predictions,

06:35.629 --> 06:37.197
but it could be any time.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.600
If you could help us
contact him,

06:39.633 --> 06:41.769
that would be very help...

06:41.802 --> 06:43.042
- Yes, I'll do that right away.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.481
- Where is he?
- Mom!

06:53.514 --> 06:56.784
- Hi, baby.
- You're hurting me.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.519
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.588
I'm just so happy you're okay.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.923
Let me see you, huh?
Are you all right?

07:02.956 --> 07:05.759
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- You okay, bud? Huh?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.961
- I fell asleep,
and when I got up,

07:07.995 --> 07:09.062
Eddie was gone.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.964
- Oh, God.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.033
I'm so sorry this happened.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.102
Well, relax.
We're gonna go home, okay?

07:15.135 --> 07:17.204
We're gonna just talk
all about this later, okay?

07:17.237 --> 07:19.206
- Okay.
- You better believe we will.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.884
How could you leave our son
with that psycho?

07:20.908 --> 07:22.142
- Benson.
- That's what he is.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.644
His whole family is.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.579
- Stop. Please.

07:25.613 --> 07:26.980
- What the hell's wrong
with you?

07:29.249 --> 07:31.184
- Did someone do something
to Eddie?

07:31.218 --> 07:32.620
They had to, right?

07:34.154 --> 07:35.756
- You know, honey, I don't know.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.658
You and me,
we're gonna find out, okay?

07:37.691 --> 07:38.959
- Okay?
- Okay.

07:38.992 --> 07:42.195
- Okay.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.632
I love you.

07:44.665 --> 07:48.168
*

07:48.201 --> 07:50.203
Where are you, Eddie?

07:50.237 --> 07:52.272
You're a denier.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.007
You're the son.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.110
What's behind the door?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.815
If you don't open it,
you'll never escape it.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.150
Johnny?

08:03.183 --> 08:04.785
- Get out of here, Eddie.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.624
Call the police, Eddie!

08:10.658 --> 08:11.992
Call the police!

08:12.025 --> 08:14.795
Before your father kills me!

08:14.828 --> 08:17.565
Come on, Dad.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.732
Come home.

08:18.766 --> 08:19.833
*

08:19.867 --> 08:21.268
Come home.

08:24.304 --> 08:29.042
*

08:32.780 --> 08:38.018
*

08:38.051 --> 08:39.152
- Eddie?

08:39.186 --> 08:40.320
Eddie.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.054
Eddie?

08:44.625 --> 08:45.826
He's not breathing.

08:45.859 --> 08:50.798
*

08:55.335 --> 08:56.770
* Looking out at the road *

08:56.804 --> 08:57.971
* Rushing under my wheels

09:01.274 --> 09:03.343
* Looking back
at the years going by *

09:03.376 --> 09:07.080
* Like so many summer fields

09:07.114 --> 09:08.616
- She loved that song.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.751
* In '65, I was 17...

09:10.784 --> 09:14.087
- Hey. They have
the best carnitas here.

09:14.121 --> 09:19.126
- I'm more interested
to hear about this Luna.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.361
Anything you can share about her
is helpful.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.297
- I can't believe
that you don't know who she is.

09:24.331 --> 09:27.300
- All I know about her
is you said she's a musician.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.237
- Luna is a pop star.
- I see.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.806
- And we're getting ready
to do this world tour,

09:32.840 --> 09:34.975
and she decides
that she needs a break

09:35.008 --> 09:37.678
and decides that she's gonna go
to the beach.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.180
We had these venues booked,
these stadiums.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.950
We're talking
millions of dollars.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.785
* Trying
not to confuse it... *

09:44.818 --> 09:46.620
- Fear.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.221
That's what I'm hearing.

09:48.255 --> 09:52.092
The key is not to,
you know, excise the fear,

09:52.125 --> 09:53.827
but you channel it.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.696
Use it.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.331
- Okay. So how?

09:58.365 --> 10:00.801
- Well, we work with
a lot of troubled young people.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.370
We have some
very effective techniques.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.706
- All right, but Luna is not
like my daughter, you know.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.307
- No.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.810
- I mean, Noa's always wanted
something to believe in,

10:09.843 --> 10:11.812
so she's easily brainwashed.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.681
- You know, we don't...
- We don't brainwash.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.048
We empower people.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.383
- Of course you do.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.851
I just mean
that I've never worked

10:17.885 --> 10:20.688
with somebody this young
and this empty.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.891
- Uh-huh.
- So how do you empower that?

10:23.924 --> 10:26.026
*

10:26.059 --> 10:27.928
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.163
- Why don't I pay for this
and we'll get out of here?

10:30.197 --> 10:35.335
*

10:35.368 --> 10:38.405
- Is that what you were planning
to use to get her back?

10:38.438 --> 10:40.240
- Only if I have to.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.811
- You won't,

10:43.844 --> 10:46.246
because what I have to offer

10:46.279 --> 10:48.448
is a hell of a lot more powerful

10:48.481 --> 10:50.884
than anything
that little handgun can fire.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.853
* I don't know
about anyone but me... *

10:52.886 --> 10:54.722
- Okay.

10:54.755 --> 10:58.291
- We haven't yet discussed,
uh, my fee.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.960
- Oh, right. Okay.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.196
I'm willing to cut you in
on my part of the take.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.766
Like, say, $50,000?

11:05.799 --> 11:07.200
If you can close the deal.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.737
* Looking out
at the road... *

11:09.770 --> 11:12.305
All right then.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.842
*

11:14.875 --> 11:17.077
* I don't know
how to tell you all *

11:17.110 --> 11:20.247
* Just how crazy
this life feels *

11:20.280 --> 11:21.715
*

11:21.749 --> 11:23.250
* Look around for the friends

11:23.283 --> 11:25.853
* That I used to turn to
to pull me through... *

11:48.776 --> 11:51.078
- Who... who's there?

11:55.182 --> 11:56.416
- Sorry to wake you.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.385
- It's all right.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.453
I'm gonna be sleeping
soon enough.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.223
So are you here
to poke me with something

12:03.256 --> 12:05.926
or pray for me?

12:05.959 --> 12:07.460
- Is that what's been happening?

12:09.162 --> 12:11.965
That's pretty much all
that happens at the end.

12:11.999 --> 12:16.169
I got rid of two priests
and a rabbi.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.906
That sounds like the beginning
of a joke.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.374
- I'm a friend of your son's.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.911
- They called me.
- I...

12:23.944 --> 12:25.879
I need to see him.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.515
- I'm afraid he's out of town
on business.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.417
- What? What business?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.185
What business
could be more impor...

12:35.455 --> 12:38.391
I need to see him.

12:38.425 --> 12:42.029
There isn't much time left.
I'm...

12:42.062 --> 12:44.131
This is it.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.034
- I've tried to reach out
several times.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.535
He doesn't want to talk to me?

12:48.568 --> 12:50.203
Oh, God damn it.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.507
I need to see him

12:54.541 --> 12:56.910
before it's too late.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.018
- If you need to unburden,

13:05.052 --> 13:06.453
I can be your guide.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.058
- You're one of them.

13:13.160 --> 13:17.230
- I'm a colleague of your son's

13:17.264 --> 13:19.299
and a lifelong friend.

13:19.332 --> 13:22.035
- What's your name?
- Sarah Lane.

13:22.069 --> 13:25.372
- Oh. I know you.

13:25.405 --> 13:29.542
You're the one
he's so in love with.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.214
*

13:34.247 --> 13:35.582
- I'll try him again.

13:35.615 --> 13:42.555
*

13:51.164 --> 13:55.035
- Come on! Wake up!

13:55.068 --> 13:57.137
- He needs medical attention.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.471
We can handle this.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.041
- There are people
we can call for help.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.042
Our people.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.276
- Wake up!

14:06.313 --> 14:10.517
*

14:10.550 --> 14:12.285
- They're trying
to bring me back.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.621
Come on, Eddie.

14:14.654 --> 14:21.895
*

14:21.929 --> 14:24.297
Come with me, Eddie.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.636
*

14:29.669 --> 14:31.204
- Eddie, wake up, man.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.973
- Come on, Eddie.

14:33.006 --> 14:33.974
Come on.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.943
- Doc?

14:35.976 --> 14:42.916
*

15:05.438 --> 15:12.379
*

15:41.641 --> 15:43.676
What's my mother doing here?

15:43.710 --> 15:46.213
- You're home, Eddie.

15:50.217 --> 15:53.053
- I don't understand.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.555
Am I dead?

15:59.192 --> 16:01.261
It's so beautiful.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.663
- You built it, not I.

16:03.696 --> 16:06.466
I was too steeped in sin.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.070
It's your Garden, Eddie.

16:10.103 --> 16:17.044
*

16:26.453 --> 16:29.522
- Doc?

16:32.559 --> 16:39.499
*

16:43.403 --> 16:44.737
Johnny.

16:44.771 --> 16:51.711
*

17:01.821 --> 17:08.428
*

17:08.461 --> 17:10.463
- Well, first, I have to pee.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.830
That was a long drive.

17:13.733 --> 17:18.771
*

17:21.808 --> 17:28.748
*

17:35.488 --> 17:36.488
*

17:40.893 --> 17:42.095
- Hi.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.164
- Finally.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.698
You're hard to reach.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.833
Where are you?

17:46.866 --> 17:49.236
- Um...

17:49.269 --> 17:52.605
I'm in someone's idea
of oblivion.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.407
- Everything all right?
- No.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.844
I got a call.
It's Brenda.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.412
She's not doing well.

17:59.446 --> 18:03.116
- What does that mean?
- She's never doing well.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.252
- Her liver, Cal.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.453
It's...

18:06.486 --> 18:08.755
It's the end.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.890
- This isn't a surprise.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.794
This is the least surprising
thing you could tell me.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.397
- She says she has
something to say.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.565
Are you with her?

18:18.598 --> 18:19.899
Yes,

18:19.932 --> 18:22.902
and she seems so small
and frightened.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.406
And I have been with people
on the threshold before,

18:26.439 --> 18:28.908
but this...
Something's holding her back.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.378
- Yeah, well, that's...
- It's not possible.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.213
I'm out here
on the other end of the earth,

18:33.246 --> 18:34.581
trying to fix my fuckup.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.449
Look. Can I, uh...

18:36.483 --> 18:38.651
Can I just say that this...

18:38.685 --> 18:42.555
this may have more of an impact
on you than you think.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.923
You know, losing the parent

18:43.956 --> 18:45.625
you've had
a terrible relationship with

18:45.658 --> 18:47.427
can be harder
than losing someone

18:47.460 --> 18:49.896
that you had a good one with,

18:49.929 --> 18:55.568
especially if you haven't made
an effort toward closure.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.873
- Whatever...

19:00.907 --> 19:03.176
parting words of poison

19:03.210 --> 19:04.477
my mother has to convey,

19:04.511 --> 19:06.446
she can do it through you.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.450
It won't, uh...

19:10.483 --> 19:12.752
It won't hurt you
the way it will hurt me.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.454
I'm sorry.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.501
- You first.
- You first.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.602
- No.
- You first.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.970
Right now.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.872
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:32.905 --> 19:36.276
- Hi.
- Can I ask what's so funny?

19:36.309 --> 19:37.977
- Cal, this is Luna.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.513
- This is Cal.
- Hi, Cal.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.818
Aww. Think we've made him
a little sad.

19:48.388 --> 19:52.259
- I think he was already sad.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.660
- Get some. Yeah.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.927
It's really good.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.729
- No.
- Really. Come on.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.233
Why not?

20:00.267 --> 20:02.302
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.271
*

20:04.304 --> 20:05.838
- Oh!
- Ooh.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.708
Oh...
nice shit, right?

20:08.741 --> 20:10.410
- Oh.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.646
*

20:16.683 --> 20:24.357
*

20:24.391 --> 20:26.459
- We don't keep that kind
of cash in the building.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.395
Maybe we can write you,
like, an invoice or...

20:28.428 --> 20:29.662
Hawk... oh, don't leave.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.902
- What's going on?

20:35.935 --> 20:37.380
- The guys are here
with all the flooring,

20:37.404 --> 20:38.681
and they refuse to give it to us

20:38.705 --> 20:40.940
unless we pay them
in cash up front.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.342
- That doesn't sound right.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.344
- They say
the last check bounced.

20:44.377 --> 20:47.580
- Okay, I'm... I'm sure
it's just a misunderstanding.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.349
- Yeah.
- I'll check it out.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.859
- Okay, 'cause they say
they're gonna leave,

20:50.883 --> 20:53.553
so people are starting
to say things.

20:55.588 --> 20:59.359
- I'm sure it's just a mistake.
- Okay. Yeah.

21:02.395 --> 21:09.336
*

21:24.817 --> 21:31.758
*

21:54.581 --> 22:01.521
*

22:09.629 --> 22:16.569
*

22:31.584 --> 22:33.386
- I'm sorry.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.522
I couldn't reach him.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.759
- Easy.
- You're gonna pull out your IV.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.127
- You're lying.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.095
I can see it in your face.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.797
He won't talk to me.

22:44.831 --> 22:48.067
- You know, people grieve
in such different ways.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.769
- Oh, fuck you.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.472
Just fuck you.
Just...

22:52.505 --> 22:53.973
- Brenda, I...
- Fuck.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.609
Fucking wisdom, fucking Light,

22:56.643 --> 22:59.178
your fucking leader...

22:59.211 --> 23:01.113
Fuck all of you.

23:01.147 --> 23:02.582
- If you need to release, fine.

23:02.615 --> 23:04.784
Just release it to me.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.720
- Oh-ho, you...

23:07.754 --> 23:09.789
You have no idea

23:09.822 --> 23:12.191
what I have to release,

23:12.224 --> 23:13.493
what I have to say.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.594
- I don't, but...

23:14.627 --> 23:17.063
I didn't protect him.

23:17.096 --> 23:20.867
I should have protected him.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.769
- Didn't protect who?

23:22.802 --> 23:26.172
- My son. Calvin.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.641
He hurt him.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.152
He hurt him,
and I didn't do anything.

23:30.176 --> 23:34.714
I... I was his mother,
and I just walked away.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.484
- Cal told me that
his dad could be violent...

23:37.517 --> 23:39.986
His drinking...
But Cal has forgiven him,

23:40.019 --> 23:41.621
and so should you.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.723
- Wha... my husband...

23:43.756 --> 23:46.826
He's a weak old drunk.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.996
Bruises heal,

23:50.029 --> 23:53.800
but what your leader did
won't heal.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.668
Never.

23:55.702 --> 23:59.539
Your doctor, Steven Meyer.

24:00.907 --> 24:04.477
Oh, he loved my son.

24:04.511 --> 24:07.980
But it wasn't right
how he loved him,

24:08.014 --> 24:09.649
and I didn't do anything.

24:09.682 --> 24:10.983
I just let it happen.

24:11.017 --> 24:13.152
- No. You're not gonna do this.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.654
I didn't want to hear it either.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.088
- You are not going to poison...

24:16.122 --> 24:19.091
- I didn't want to hear it,
but I saw it.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.192
- No.
- I went...

24:20.226 --> 24:21.728
- No.
- In the tent.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.539
- I am not gonna listen
to these kinds of lies.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.632
- He was holding him,
and it was wrong.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.967
- These disgusting accusations.
- Wrong.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.739
- You know, you are gonna leave
this world alone.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.842
And it is exactly
what you deserve.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.978
- Please.
- Tell him I'm sorry.

24:39.011 --> 24:44.717
Please. I'm so...
I'm so sorry.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.654
I'm so sorry.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.989
I'm so sorry.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.624
I'm so sorry.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.029
This place...

24:57.063 --> 25:00.833
This is where you've been?

25:00.867 --> 25:02.769
I don't know.
It's...

25:02.802 --> 25:04.937
It's different.
It's...

25:04.971 --> 25:06.539
It's more...

25:06.573 --> 25:09.075
It's fucking beautiful here.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.744
It's like a paradise.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.913
It's all so green.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.815
Everybody's so happy.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.684
- It's not finished.

25:18.885 --> 25:21.588
- It's not...
- What happened?

25:27.259 --> 25:29.195
- I was, uh, struck
by lightning.

25:29.228 --> 25:33.065
- Jesus. You survived?

25:33.099 --> 25:36.168
- Hey. Johnny.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.339
Why did you...

25:40.372 --> 25:41.708
- What?

25:44.944 --> 25:46.746
Oh, yeah.

25:48.981 --> 25:52.752
You know,
I don't even really remember.

25:52.785 --> 25:53.986
Isn't that lame?

25:54.020 --> 25:59.125
All I remember
is wanting to go so bad.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.163
But you got struck by lightning

26:04.196 --> 26:05.798
and you lived.

26:05.832 --> 26:07.166
There has to be a reason
for that.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.137
Something you've got to do.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.708
- You know, uh...

26:17.043 --> 26:19.879
I was trying to save someone.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.284
But I couldn't.

26:25.317 --> 26:28.387
A storm came in, and, you know,

26:28.420 --> 26:33.159
I had ahold of him,
but I let go.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.794
- You couldn't hold on?

26:37.697 --> 26:42.334
- No, I tried so hard, but...

26:44.203 --> 26:46.839
You couldn't save him.

26:46.873 --> 26:50.843
There's nothing you can do.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.712
There's nothing
you could've done.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.180
You hear me?

26:54.213 --> 26:56.115
Eddie,
you got to understand that.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.650
There's nothing.

26:57.684 --> 26:59.886
Eddie, come on.
It is not your fault.

26:59.919 --> 27:02.755
These things are not your fault.
You're just a person, okay?

27:02.789 --> 27:04.323
You have to understand that.

27:04.356 --> 27:05.992
There is nothing
you could've done.

27:06.025 --> 27:09.228
Look at me, Eddie.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.130
It is not your fault.

27:11.163 --> 27:14.200
There is nothing
you could've done!

27:14.233 --> 27:15.902
Nothing!

27:39.191 --> 27:43.262
*

28:10.022 --> 28:13.392
Doesn't it feel good
to just run?

28:13.425 --> 28:14.961
And not on that treadmill

28:14.994 --> 28:16.739
with that stupid trainer
always yelling at me?

28:16.763 --> 28:18.197
- That's right.
- Well, you just run

28:18.230 --> 28:20.767
your little heart out
for me today,

28:20.800 --> 28:23.435
'cause tomorrow morning...

28:23.469 --> 28:24.980
- You know, when I was...
- When I was little,

28:25.004 --> 28:26.739
my mom used to take me
to the mall

28:26.773 --> 28:29.441
and let me do a full belt
at the top of the escalator,

28:29.475 --> 28:31.510
just to hear my voice
echo around us,

28:31.543 --> 28:33.312
and people would look up like,

28:33.345 --> 28:36.916
"Oh, is that little girl
making all that sound?"

28:36.949 --> 28:40.787
Now it's just a stupid job.
Who cares?

28:40.820 --> 28:42.855
- Well, what if I told you...
- Wait, wait, wait.

28:42.889 --> 28:45.191
People care. Sweetheart.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.293
Your fans care.
They love you.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.161
Millions of them.

28:49.195 --> 28:53.032
- What if I told you that you
could feel that freedom again,

28:53.065 --> 28:55.167
all right,
that you used to feel?

28:55.201 --> 28:58.805
You know, playing,
but not only onstage...

28:58.838 --> 28:59.806
All the time.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.373
That level of freedom,

29:01.407 --> 29:03.342
but every waking moment.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.877
- Fuck, yes.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.121
Yeah, I want
to feel joy all the time.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.247
- Yes. Joy.
- Tell her. He knows.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.516
- Well, that's... that's part
of the problem, right?

29:10.549 --> 29:13.519
We always focus
on the immediate...

29:13.552 --> 29:16.288
The things, the surface, right?

29:16.322 --> 29:17.532
But what I'm offering you
is a chance

29:17.556 --> 29:20.092
to feel unlimited fulfillment.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.061
Not joy, all right?

29:22.094 --> 29:24.430
When you take The Light
into your heart,

29:24.463 --> 29:26.198
you unlock something infinite.

29:26.232 --> 29:27.934
Mm-hmm.

29:27.967 --> 29:30.837
- It's like an elevator
in a tower with no limits

29:30.870 --> 29:35.407
that just keeps going
as far as you can imagine.

29:35.441 --> 29:39.211
- Why do I feel like
I'm at some time-share place?

29:39.245 --> 29:41.313
Who is he, Jackie?

29:41.347 --> 29:42.448
- He runs a cult.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.083
- No. No.
- Really?

29:44.116 --> 29:45.327
- No, we're not a cult.
- But, listen...

29:45.351 --> 29:46.561
Noa, my daughter,
has been there.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.387
He has helped her so much,

29:48.420 --> 29:50.289
and I thought
that he could help you too.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.925
- Well, you guys are depressing
the shit out of me,

29:52.959 --> 29:54.426
and I need a bump.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.097
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.400
Thank you.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.238
Guys, come on!

30:06.272 --> 30:07.940
Back to the house!

30:09.942 --> 30:13.512
- First rule of sales?
- Got to believe your own pitch.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.381
- It's not a pitch.

30:15.414 --> 30:16.854
You people just don't want
to hear it

30:16.883 --> 30:18.150
because it's not easy.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.585
It's not
the immediate gratification

30:19.618 --> 30:21.153
of shoving that stuff
up your nose.

30:21.187 --> 30:23.589
- You're not convincing anybody,
Cal.

30:23.622 --> 30:26.392
You're not even convincing
yourself.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.516
Hello?

30:50.549 --> 30:53.085
- Mom?
- Hawk?

30:53.119 --> 30:54.653
What are you doing?

30:54.686 --> 30:56.555
Summer will be so happy
to see you.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.124
How bad is it?

30:58.157 --> 30:59.401
- What's wrong?
- The money we owe.

30:59.425 --> 31:02.194
- Oh...

31:02.228 --> 31:04.163
- What?
- Don't deny it.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.299
Just respect me enough
not to deny it.

31:07.333 --> 31:10.102
- I cannot believe your
grandparents would involve you.

31:10.136 --> 31:11.971
- They... they didn't.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.506
And let me stop you from digging
yourself a deeper hole.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.208
No one else did either.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.244
I saw the bills myself.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.212
And...

31:20.246 --> 31:22.648
And that's... that's why

31:22.681 --> 31:26.919
Cal wanted Noa's mom
to write the check.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.094
Is it over?

31:35.127 --> 31:38.130
- All of this?
- No.

31:38.164 --> 31:40.132
Of course not.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.369
We're handling it.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.672
Cal and I together,
we're handling this.

31:46.705 --> 31:52.211
- Lately, at the center,
when someone has a problem

31:52.244 --> 31:53.355
or someone needs help
with anything,

31:53.379 --> 31:55.181
they come to me,

31:55.214 --> 31:59.051
and I help them if I can,
and if I can't,

31:59.085 --> 32:03.055
I tell them straight-up.

32:04.590 --> 32:08.560
Because they know
I'll be honest with them,

32:08.594 --> 32:10.562
even when the truth hurts.

32:13.599 --> 32:20.372
*

32:20.406 --> 32:22.341
- The Movement

32:22.374 --> 32:25.444
is stronger than ever.

32:27.479 --> 32:31.217
In you, clearly.

32:33.419 --> 32:36.488
And if the rest of us
just continue

32:36.522 --> 32:41.327
to follow the path
of Truth and Light,

32:41.360 --> 32:46.465
then we will continue
to be strong together.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.738
Pray with me?

33:03.515 --> 33:06.652
It seems we won't have answers.

33:06.685 --> 33:09.655
No proof.

33:09.688 --> 33:14.126
We'll have to take what we have
and make sense of it,

33:14.160 --> 33:16.262
as so many have done before.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.235
- He killed Steve.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.673
He killed Steve!

33:27.706 --> 33:29.708
- He was already dead!

33:29.741 --> 33:31.710
*

33:31.743 --> 33:37.083
The moment he had cancer,
it told you.

33:37.116 --> 33:42.388
It told all of us
that he was a man.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.690
Just a man!

33:44.723 --> 33:46.592
I didn't do that.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.761
That's the truth.

34:10.815 --> 34:14.186
- I was with him.
- Yes, we know.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.621
On the mountain.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.054
- No.

34:20.359 --> 34:23.161
In The Garden.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.496
Just now.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.666
He took me there.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.668
I saw...

34:30.702 --> 34:33.472
what it could be.

34:36.342 --> 34:39.145
I felt love.

34:39.178 --> 34:42.248
I felt forgiveness.

34:47.286 --> 34:50.589
I felt peace.

34:50.621 --> 34:57.563
*

35:23.489 --> 35:24.890
- Eddie.

35:26.358 --> 35:27.526
Come in.

35:29.261 --> 35:30.538
- Is Johnny here?
- Please tell me.

35:30.562 --> 35:31.606
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- He's okay?

35:31.630 --> 35:32.664
- He's fine. He's fine,

35:32.698 --> 35:34.266
but where the fuck were you?

35:34.300 --> 35:35.601
Where did you go?
What...

35:35.634 --> 35:36.911
- I'm gonna tell you
what happened.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.470
I just need you to listen.

35:38.504 --> 35:39.671
- No. No.
- Please.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.673
- No. You know what?
- No. Just, you...

35:41.707 --> 35:43.451
There's just nothing you can say
that's gonna make this better.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.311
- Look, listen to me.
- They took me, okay?

35:45.344 --> 35:47.413
- They forced me.
- Eddie,

35:47.446 --> 35:48.880
- If you are hearing voices...

35:48.914 --> 35:52.351
- It's not voices, okay?
- This happened.

35:52.384 --> 35:53.952
The Meyerists, they took me.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.521
They drugged me.
They tied me up.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.923
I told them
that Johnny was out there,

35:57.956 --> 35:59.858
but they did not care.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.827
They wanted me back.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.398
- What did you say?

36:08.967 --> 36:11.937
- I told them
that it wasn't gonna happen.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.706
- Okay, you need
to call the fucking cops.

36:14.740 --> 36:17.209
You need to report them
right now.

36:17.243 --> 36:18.677
- No, no, no, no.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.412
Eddie, why not?

36:20.446 --> 36:22.414
They're fucking criminals!

36:22.448 --> 36:24.316
They need to be in jail,
all of them!

36:24.350 --> 36:26.585
Look. Look.

36:26.618 --> 36:29.821
My kids are there.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.358
Okay?

36:33.425 --> 36:35.394
They have my kids.

36:38.430 --> 36:45.371
*

36:48.574 --> 36:53.745
- Then I guess
it's never over, then, is it?

36:53.779 --> 36:56.782
No matter what.

36:56.815 --> 37:03.755
*

37:25.711 --> 37:32.651
*

37:50.636 --> 37:53.339
- Look like you could use
some company.

37:53.372 --> 37:55.441
- I don't want to go back.

37:55.474 --> 37:58.644
- No, I know.
- I know.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.679
You shouldn't have to.

38:03.982 --> 38:07.386
I didn't have much
of a childhood either.

38:08.887 --> 38:11.690
Never went to school.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.792
I wasn't a pop star,

38:13.825 --> 38:17.829
but I was told I was special.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.833
Held apart.

38:21.867 --> 38:24.770
And, you know,
looking back, I...

38:24.803 --> 38:26.572
- I just want to be gone.

38:29.541 --> 38:30.909
- I know you do.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.478
- I don't want to hurt nobody.

38:32.511 --> 38:36.014
I just want to disappear.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.517
- Well, then...

38:40.118 --> 38:41.987
Disappear.

38:45.591 --> 38:49.461
- Just take your keys

38:49.495 --> 38:52.364
and go.

38:52.398 --> 38:55.066
Just keep driving.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.704
Till you're far away.

39:00.706 --> 39:02.608
Till you feel safe.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.646
- I can do that?

39:07.679 --> 39:08.747
- Yeah.

39:10.148 --> 39:12.818
Yeah, you can.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.019
- I can do that.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.421
- You should.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.456
- I should.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.992
I should.

39:24.029 --> 39:29.100
*

39:35.541 --> 39:42.481
*

39:56.862 --> 39:58.830
- Cal.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.466
I'm so glad it's you.

40:00.499 --> 40:02.834
I have to tell you, um,

40:02.868 --> 40:05.437
your mom, she passed.

40:05.471 --> 40:10.175
They said that she went
quietly and peacefully.

40:13.679 --> 40:14.646
Cal?

40:14.680 --> 40:15.881
- Yeah.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.617
I wanted you to know

40:18.650 --> 40:20.952
the check
that we were hoping for,

40:20.986 --> 40:24.656
I can't...
I can't get it after all.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.225
- Did you hear what I just said?

40:27.258 --> 40:29.695
I know that I'm failing you.

40:31.162 --> 40:35.934
Wish there was another way,
but...

40:35.967 --> 40:39.204
Sarah, I don't...
I don't think that I could live

40:39.237 --> 40:42.708
with the person
I've become I-if...

40:42.741 --> 40:43.975
- It's okay.

40:44.009 --> 40:47.212
No. No, it isn't.

40:47.245 --> 40:48.747
- Not right now,

40:48.780 --> 40:51.216
but it will be.

40:51.249 --> 40:54.152
I will see to it.

40:54.185 --> 41:01.126
*

41:02.794 --> 41:05.631
- What did she need to tell me
so badly anyway?

41:05.664 --> 41:07.198
Did you find out?

41:11.537 --> 41:14.139
- She wanted to apologize.

41:16.007 --> 41:19.277
She knows that she wasn't much

41:19.310 --> 41:21.246
of a mother.

41:21.279 --> 41:22.948
She loves you,

41:22.981 --> 41:26.217
and she's proud of the man
that you became.

41:26.251 --> 41:33.191
*

41:41.567 --> 41:46.237
Okay, so I should be back
at about 6:00.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.939
- Yeah.
- Okay?

41:47.973 --> 41:49.007
Love you.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.175
Bye.

42:08.627 --> 42:10.896
I'm not a bad person.

42:10.929 --> 42:15.266
I know right and wrong.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.903
There's just something
inside me...

42:17.936 --> 42:20.205
it makes me do
these terrible things.

42:31.049 --> 42:36.021
- Cal. Wake up.
- Wake up.

42:36.054 --> 42:39.625
Where's Luna?
Do you know?

42:39.658 --> 42:42.728
I got to get her ready
and go back to L.A.

42:49.100 --> 42:52.237
- I let her go.
- What?

42:53.805 --> 42:55.306
- She's gone.

42:57.108 --> 42:58.610
I told her to get
as far away from you

42:58.644 --> 43:00.011
as she could.

43:00.045 --> 43:02.714
- Far away from me?

43:02.748 --> 43:03.915
Why the fuck?

43:03.949 --> 43:06.351
- You'd tear that kid apart.

43:06.384 --> 43:08.286
You're lucky

43:08.319 --> 43:10.822
that your own daughter
had the courage

43:10.856 --> 43:12.257
to get away from you.

43:14.259 --> 43:16.127
- Fuck you.

43:19.931 --> 43:24.636
- You're supposed to be
the adult.

43:24.670 --> 43:27.639
Huh, you're supposed
to be the one

43:27.673 --> 43:30.876
making the right decisions

43:30.909 --> 43:32.978
for your child.

43:36.748 --> 43:41.352
Not always thinking
about your own needs...

43:43.221 --> 43:45.090
And your own desires.

43:46.858 --> 43:49.995
Guilting everyone around you
into fulfilling them.

43:52.297 --> 43:56.835
Don't wait until it's too late

43:56.868 --> 43:59.270
to be a good mother.

45:04.502 --> 45:06.471
- I have something for you.

45:20.551 --> 45:22.788
- Was this Steve's?

45:22.821 --> 45:24.355
- It was the first one
made for him

45:24.389 --> 45:27.058
after The Ladder was revealed.

45:27.092 --> 45:30.361
I took it off him
when we found his body.

45:30.395 --> 45:32.831
I kept it safe.

45:34.199 --> 45:37.068
Wasn't even sure why.

45:37.102 --> 45:38.436
Until now.

45:38.469 --> 45:41.206
- No, Richard.
- I... I can't accept this.

45:41.239 --> 45:43.408
- The Light is in you.
- No.

45:43.441 --> 45:45.076
- You're marked with it.

45:45.110 --> 45:47.813
- Richard.

45:47.846 --> 45:51.249
What, this?
Look, that's the lightning.

45:51.282 --> 45:52.250
What?

45:52.283 --> 45:54.552
- Is it?

45:54.585 --> 45:57.222
You know.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.290
- You know.
- No.

45:59.324 --> 46:02.894
- You will build The Garden.

46:02.928 --> 46:06.031
- Richard, I just...

46:08.834 --> 46:11.136
- And we will follow you there.
