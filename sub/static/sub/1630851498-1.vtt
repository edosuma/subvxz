03:33.594 --> 03:38.067
<i>most perfect achievement
in human history.</i>

03:40.068 --> 03:42.671
<i>Love in its purest form.</i>

03:44.872 --> 03:49.677
<i>I have dedicated my life
to practicing Christmas.</i>

03:58.753 --> 04:01.823
<i>Christmas is an opportunity
to give,</i>

04:01.956 --> 04:04.492
<i>expecting nothing in return.</i>

04:14.235 --> 04:16.738
<i>To paint a picture
of our own worth.</i>

04:19.240 --> 04:22.311
<i>All the other days
are just gray.</i>

04:27.949 --> 04:29.251
<i>I hate gray.</i>

04:30.485 --> 04:33.222
<i>Christmas is cool.</i>

04:34.456 --> 04:36.358
<i>In this world,
you're either cool,</i>

04:36.490 --> 04:38.627
<i>or you're not cool.
You see that guy?</i>

04:38.759 --> 04:39.995
<i>He's cool.</i>

04:40.127 --> 04:41.596
Super cool!

04:42.197 --> 04:43.298
Hey!

04:44.331 --> 04:45.901
We never really talked
or anything,

04:46.033 --> 04:47.435
but we ride the same train.

04:47.769 --> 04:50.738
I try to be cool like him.
I do everything I possibly can.

04:50.872 --> 04:53.942
I keep Christmas alive
all year long.

04:54.074 --> 04:55.610
How cool is that?

04:58.178 --> 05:00.214
<i>Christmas is not just a holida.</i>

05:00.516 --> 05:02.184
<i>It's a way of life,</i>

05:02.317 --> 05:05.620
<i>and a daily challenge
to be perfect.</i>

05:06.019 --> 05:09.257
<i>As perfect as Christmas.</i>

05:09.625 --> 05:13.562
<i>I love everything
about Christmas.</i>

05:13.928 --> 05:16.430
<i>I can't even wait
for Christmas morning.</i>

05:16.564 --> 05:18.199
<i>I'm up at midnight.</i>

05:18.333 --> 05:20.369
<i>12:01, actually.</i>

05:20.502 --> 05:23.038
<i>Don't want to seem too eager.</i>

05:32.646 --> 05:33.781
Perfect!

05:33.915 --> 05:36.217
<i>I love the smell of Christmas.</i>

05:36.350 --> 05:37.418
<i>Cinnamon,</i>

05:37.552 --> 05:39.521
<i>fresh pine scent.</i>

05:39.653 --> 05:41.589
<i>Chestnuts roasting...</i>

05:41.723 --> 05:44.293
<i>...ideally, and the colors.</i>

05:45.060 --> 05:47.295
<i>It's magic.</i>

05:48.197 --> 05:50.665
<i>That's all
everybody wants, right?</i>

05:51.031 --> 05:52.233
<i>A little magic?</i>

05:52.901 --> 05:55.737
<i>To be happy.
Have a perfect life.</i>

05:55.870 --> 05:59.841
<i>Lots of friends,
community, family...</i>

06:00.240 --> 06:01.442
<i>that loves you.</i>

06:01.675 --> 06:04.045
<i>Well,
that's what Christmas does.</i>

06:04.346 --> 06:07.014
<i>Christmas colors
are the happiest,</i>

06:07.148 --> 06:10.919
<i>because Christmas
makes everyone happy.</i>

06:11.552 --> 06:16.791
<i>Christmas lights make any house
the happiest house on the block.</i>

06:18.492 --> 06:20.394
<i>Look at that house.</i>

06:20.528 --> 06:23.331
<i>I bet whoever lives there
has the happiest,</i>

06:23.463 --> 06:26.634
<i>most perfect life of anybody.</i>

06:26.767 --> 06:29.236
<i>You guessed it. It's my house.</i>

06:29.370 --> 06:30.605
<i>Winning!</i>

06:31.339 --> 06:33.407
My mom's therapist
thinks I'm weird.

06:33.875 --> 06:35.076
Everybody does.

06:35.642 --> 06:37.611
You're judging me
right now, too.

06:37.978 --> 06:39.313
Don't deny it.

06:39.548 --> 06:42.182
You're making your mind up now
that I'm not normal.

06:42.449 --> 06:44.551
That there's something
wrong with me.

06:44.685 --> 06:46.453
Like, there's something wrong

06:46.586 --> 06:48.589
with wanting to live
in a world with magic,

06:48.723 --> 06:52.093
and people are nice and don't
hate you for being different.

06:52.461 --> 06:54.562
And for liking Christmas
more than they do.

06:54.829 --> 06:57.132
Because this world
needs Christmas.

06:57.264 --> 06:59.533
Serious Christmas every day.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.536
Try telling that
to a world of 12-25ers.

07:02.771 --> 07:06.307
Sometimes, it makes me
wanna jump off a bridge.

07:07.007 --> 07:09.710
But I'm no George Bailey.
I'm just a freak.

07:09.843 --> 07:11.146
A Christmas freak.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.848
Merry Christmas!

07:46.982 --> 07:48.517
It's not Christmas!

07:49.216 --> 07:50.450
Weirdo.

07:50.718 --> 07:53.754
<i>OMG.
Romans are taking a census.</i>

07:53.889 --> 07:56.156
They haven't invented
change of address forms yet,

07:56.290 --> 07:58.125
so we have to go
back to Bethlehem

07:58.259 --> 07:59.260
where we were born.

07:59.394 --> 08:01.663
Very inconvenient. I'm walking.

08:01.795 --> 08:04.399
My wife is pregnant.
Technically I'm not the father,

08:04.531 --> 08:05.933
but I'm cool with it.

08:06.067 --> 08:07.802
Not like I'm going
to abandon them on Christmas.

08:07.935 --> 08:10.471
That'd be the worst thing
anybody could do on Christmas.

08:10.605 --> 08:12.039
We are a perfect family.

08:12.173 --> 08:14.442
Very modern, even though
we live in ancient times.

08:15.677 --> 08:17.345
Rudy was always a strange boy.

08:22.684 --> 08:25.286
- Hi, Mom.
- Where are you?

08:25.420 --> 08:28.924
I'm home, but you know that
because you track my phone.

08:29.057 --> 08:31.359
<i>My therapist says
a mother never stops worrying.</i>

08:31.492 --> 08:34.095
- Tell your therapist I'm 43.
- <i>He knows.</i>

08:34.229 --> 08:36.431
<i>He says that you're old enough
to be much more</i>

08:36.563 --> 08:38.164
considerate of my feelings.

08:38.899 --> 08:41.568
- <i>He says you're very selfish.</i>
- He must be expensive.

08:41.702 --> 08:44.004
Rudy expects too much
from people.

08:44.272 --> 08:46.206
He expects everyone to be good.

08:46.606 --> 08:48.076
I worry about him.

08:48.208 --> 08:50.611
That sort of thinking
just leads to disappointment.

08:50.745 --> 08:52.447
<i>What time will you be here?</i>

08:52.813 --> 08:54.514
I have plans with friends today.

08:54.649 --> 08:56.749
You don't have friends.

08:57.152 --> 08:58.653
Thanks for reminding me.

08:58.787 --> 09:00.388
I think Rudy is kind of cool.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.955
He's not cool.

09:02.090 --> 09:04.393
I guess a boy's best friend
really is his mother.

09:04.525 --> 09:06.059
<i>Oh,
the line from</i> Psycho.

09:06.193 --> 09:08.062
Very amusing, Rudy. Of course,

09:08.196 --> 09:11.298
Norman Bates' mother was dead.
Is that what you'd prefer?

09:13.067 --> 09:14.269
- Rudy?
- <i>No.</i>

09:14.403 --> 09:15.671
<i>That wasn't convincing.</i>

09:15.803 --> 09:17.706
My therapist
will find that fascinating.

09:17.839 --> 09:19.808
You haven't met a girl,
have you?

09:20.341 --> 09:21.610
You're my only girl.

09:21.743 --> 09:24.445
I like him.
Not like, like him like him.

09:24.578 --> 09:26.447
I mean, kinda.

09:27.114 --> 09:28.182
He's different.

09:28.316 --> 09:30.786
I like him. He's cute.

09:31.986 --> 09:32.987
He's not cute.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.021
You haven't forgotten
about dinner?

09:35.155 --> 09:36.625
No, Mom.

09:36.758 --> 09:38.225
<i>There's something different
about you today.</i>

09:38.359 --> 09:40.662
<i>A mother can sense these thing.</i>

09:40.794 --> 09:42.264
<i>I hope I'm not picking up on</i>

09:42.397 --> 09:44.799
<i>another one of your annoying
cries for help.</i>

09:45.265 --> 09:47.902
<i>My therapist says I'm an empat.</i>

09:51.105 --> 09:52.407
Mom,

09:52.841 --> 09:55.275
do you remember the Christmas
we gave away all my presents?

09:55.409 --> 09:58.413
<i>Here we go again.
I told you a million times,</i>

09:58.546 --> 10:00.048
<i>that was your father's idea.</i>

10:00.182 --> 10:03.418
<i>My therapist says you blame me.
You don't, do you?</i>

10:03.551 --> 10:05.552
That was our best Christmas.

10:06.086 --> 10:08.789
<i>That was your father's
last Christmas.</i>

10:09.756 --> 10:11.758
<i>"We have too many things,"
he said.</i>

10:12.192 --> 10:15.196
He was right. Nobody cares
about what's important.

10:15.529 --> 10:16.963
Nobody cares.

10:17.230 --> 10:18.633
<i>You sound just like him.</i>

10:19.200 --> 10:21.903
- Do you forgive him?
- <i>He doesn't deserve forgivenes.</i>

10:22.035 --> 10:25.105
That is not very
Christmassy of you.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.407
It's February, you idiot.

10:26.541 --> 10:27.708
<i>Not Christmas.</i>

10:28.176 --> 10:30.878
<i>My therapist
says you're broken.</i>

10:31.011 --> 10:33.480
- Yeah.
- That's why you're single.

10:33.615 --> 10:36.418
- <i>You're single.</i>
- <i>Grow up, Rudy.</i>

10:39.921 --> 10:42.256
He's a dreamer. Like his father.

10:42.389 --> 10:45.460
My name is Luis Reyes.
I work with Rudy in the kitchen.

10:45.594 --> 10:47.396
<i>I don't talk to him.</i>

10:47.961 --> 10:49.029
Hey, Luis.

10:50.131 --> 10:51.632
- That's cool.
- I was pretty sure

10:51.765 --> 10:52.832
he liked me back.

10:53.134 --> 10:54.936
He never came out
and said it, though.

10:55.302 --> 10:56.471
You know how guys are.

10:57.138 --> 11:00.641
He's not normal. I need normal.
Abnormal can get you killed.

11:00.774 --> 11:02.976
He's weird. He's got no <i>huevos.</i>

11:03.110 --> 11:06.047
He lets everyone
push him around. <i>Débiles.</i>

11:06.581 --> 11:08.349
I don't let nobody
push me around.

11:08.482 --> 11:10.451
Luis! Zip it!

11:11.652 --> 11:13.621
Oh, I'm Clarice.

11:13.754 --> 11:15.757
I work with Rudy at Moonracer's.

11:15.889 --> 11:18.591
We sometimes look at each other
when we're working.

11:18.725 --> 11:21.028
I look at him. We're busy.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.032
He doesn't really
have time to look at me.

11:28.970 --> 11:30.939
I saw him talking
to a salt shaker one time.

11:31.072 --> 11:33.707
- <i>♪ I'm a misfit salt shaker ♪</i>
- He was singing,

11:33.841 --> 11:35.442
<i>♪ I'm a misfit toy ♪</i>

11:35.576 --> 11:39.145
<i>♪ I'm a salt shaker with pepper
I'm a pepper shaker with salt ♪</i>

11:39.279 --> 11:44.918
<i>♪ Life could be sweeter
If I was sugar ♪</i>

11:45.052 --> 11:51.659
<i>♪ Instead I'm treated like
I'm a booger ♪</i>

11:51.793 --> 11:54.895
<i>♪ Stuck on your finger
Flick it on the wall ♪</i>

11:55.028 --> 11:56.998
<i>♪ Nobody wanted me at all ♪</i>

11:57.131 --> 11:59.032
It was cute. He's cute.

11:59.166 --> 12:01.503
He did something, right?
Dude's all messed up,

12:01.635 --> 12:03.237
walking around singing
"Merry Christmas"

12:03.370 --> 12:04.739
all the time. He's a freak.

12:04.871 --> 12:07.107
God knows I tried.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.777
I did everything
a loving mother could.

12:09.910 --> 12:11.578
What did he do?
He killed somebody?

12:11.711 --> 12:13.413
- He's incel, right?
- He's not incel.

12:13.548 --> 12:15.448
It's always the mothers fault.

12:16.017 --> 12:19.220
I suffered from extreme anxiety
when the surrogate was pregnant.

12:19.352 --> 12:22.089
They tell little boys,
"Be tough, be hard.

12:22.224 --> 12:24.893
Be ready to fight. You want
to be normal, don't you?"

12:25.025 --> 12:28.695
<i>It's crazy!
I think Rudy's the normal one.</i>

12:28.830 --> 12:30.298
He's not mean,

12:30.431 --> 12:33.533
and I don't blame him
for liking Christmas so much.

12:33.668 --> 12:36.104
Nothing bad
ever happens at Christmas.

12:38.807 --> 12:41.408
It's time to wake up, Rudy.
Choo choo!

12:48.249 --> 12:51.252
<i>Gotta get to Santa's
workshop and make the toys.</i>

13:25.318 --> 13:26.587
It's broke!

13:34.562 --> 13:36.831
Hey! What are you doing?

13:36.964 --> 13:39.100
You just gonna leave that
there on the street?

13:46.974 --> 13:48.777
What about that other one?

13:48.909 --> 13:50.644
It falls on the ground,
it's mine.

14:04.792 --> 14:06.661
Bye.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.933
He calls the facility
"Santa's workshop,"

14:13.067 --> 14:14.302
but it's called Moonracer's.

14:14.436 --> 14:17.971
And he calls the residents
"Santa's elves."

14:18.206 --> 14:19.440
It's cute.

14:19.573 --> 14:21.442
<i>And finally,
today's word is forgiveness...</i>

14:21.576 --> 14:25.013
This isn't what
I ordered, and it needs salt.

14:27.148 --> 14:29.283
Thank you, dear,
anyway.

14:29.417 --> 14:31.686
<i>And Wednesday night
is bingo night.</i>

14:32.186 --> 14:33.888
He was right the first time.

14:34.254 --> 14:36.691
I forgot what I ordered.

14:44.599 --> 14:45.867
That's my tip!

14:46.000 --> 14:47.234
Excuse me,
did an elf drop this?

14:47.368 --> 14:49.504
- It was on the floor.
- Ma'am, be cool!

14:49.638 --> 14:52.574
Oh yes, I did lose that.
Thank you, baby.

14:52.706 --> 14:58.746
Merry Christmas.
Who here likes cookies?

15:06.787 --> 15:08.756
Heads up! Watch it, soldier.

15:08.889 --> 15:10.258
Sorry, I didn't see you.

15:10.390 --> 15:13.059
You came in the out door.
That's the out door.

15:13.192 --> 15:14.595
Really?

15:14.729 --> 15:17.230
- But didn't I come in that door?
- Yes.

15:17.365 --> 15:19.500
- And I'm the commanding officer?
- Yes, sir.

15:19.634 --> 15:20.969
Then that's the in door.

15:21.101 --> 15:22.770
That isn't safe, sir.

15:22.903 --> 15:25.272
You know what else
isn't safe? Attitude.

15:25.538 --> 15:27.040
You need an attitude adjustment?

15:27.173 --> 15:29.543
Because the enemy is
all too willing to give you one.

15:29.844 --> 15:31.212
Enemy?

15:31.345 --> 15:33.915
Mickey, table six
wants to know when bingo starts.

15:34.048 --> 15:36.083
Bingo is on Wednesdays.
Did you tell them that?

15:36.216 --> 15:37.785
- No.
- Could you do that?

15:37.918 --> 15:39.620
They want to talk to a manager.

15:39.754 --> 15:41.322
Right there, attitude.
You see that?

15:41.456 --> 15:43.456
You deflected.
That was deflection.

15:43.857 --> 15:45.392
You gotta take ownership,
Clarice.

15:45.525 --> 15:48.027
The war is already over
unless you take ownership.

15:48.261 --> 15:50.630
This guy may be
full-on section eight,

15:50.764 --> 15:52.566
but at least he owns it.

15:52.899 --> 15:55.403
Now go tell table six I'm busy.

15:55.803 --> 15:58.839
I've got one guy around here
living in the real world.

15:58.972 --> 16:00.974
Does his job,
got his head on straight.

16:01.107 --> 16:03.644
- Never leaves the field early.
- Stop, grandpa!

16:03.778 --> 16:05.512
I ain't touching that.
I'm not here.

16:05.645 --> 16:08.415
- You don't feel me...
- Sticky <i>pendejo.</i>

16:08.548 --> 16:10.851
Sorry, boss. There's
something sticky out there.

16:10.985 --> 16:12.753
It's on the floor.
It's on tables.

16:13.053 --> 16:15.255
Old people are sticky.
You ever notice that?

16:15.389 --> 16:17.625
- You love sticky.
- No I don't.

16:17.758 --> 16:19.860
- Just clean it up.
- Make him do it.

16:19.994 --> 16:22.096
I hired you to clean up
after the residents.

16:22.229 --> 16:24.432
You wanna do what I
hired you to do, don't you?

16:24.566 --> 16:25.932
- It's nasty.
- Say it.

16:26.066 --> 16:29.202
- Say I want to do it.
- I don't want to do it.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.538
- I wanna do it.
- Of course you do.

16:31.672 --> 16:34.609
And I will provide you
the opportunity to succeed.

16:35.009 --> 16:37.411
Just bring the right food
to the right people.

16:37.544 --> 16:39.079
It's not rocket science.

16:39.214 --> 16:40.915
He did.
She forgot what she order...

16:41.048 --> 16:43.283
Attitude! Right there.

16:45.285 --> 16:48.122
Those dishes aren't gonna
wash themselves, soldier.

16:49.490 --> 16:52.192
I'm off work now.
I'm supposed to go help my mom.

16:52.326 --> 16:54.195
Ain't no mommy's on this team.

16:54.428 --> 16:55.596
Just a daddy.

16:56.397 --> 16:59.233
Mr. Buchenwald,
what seems to be the trouble?

16:59.365 --> 17:01.936
Please, move along!

17:08.541 --> 17:09.576
I...

17:10.944 --> 17:14.248
I was going to give this to you
on the actual Valentine's Day,

17:14.382 --> 17:16.384
but you probably won't be here

17:16.517 --> 17:19.487
because you're probably
going to get fired.

17:48.015 --> 17:50.251
<i>I wish I was that cool.</i>

18:10.538 --> 18:12.874
<i>I admit the Christmas
thing is pretty high</i>

18:13.007 --> 18:14.709
<i>on the OCD scale.</i>

18:14.843 --> 18:16.710
And I think he's got
a pretty active,

18:16.844 --> 18:18.913
you know, inner monologue.

18:19.279 --> 18:21.816
That's why I made these videos
and sent them to you.

18:21.950 --> 18:23.984
I want other people
to see what I see.

18:24.117 --> 18:27.120
- So you were...
- I wasn't stalking him.

18:28.955 --> 18:30.123
Who we talking about?

18:30.258 --> 18:31.959
We're talking
about Rudy Rotnase.

18:32.093 --> 18:33.961
Why are we talking about Rudy?

18:34.295 --> 18:36.263
- Has he died?
- No. No.

18:36.396 --> 18:38.531
Would you say Rudy is
a cool guy?

18:38.665 --> 18:40.367
What do you mean by cool?

18:41.169 --> 18:42.537
Okay.

18:42.670 --> 18:44.105
When Rudy was a little boy,

18:44.238 --> 18:46.374
I used to dress him up
in all these little outfits

18:46.507 --> 18:48.409
for all the different holidays.

18:48.675 --> 18:50.711
It was absolutely adorable.

18:51.011 --> 18:53.681
All the kids in school
were very jealous.

18:53.913 --> 18:54.948
Funny story.

18:55.249 --> 18:57.183
He used to always cry and say,

18:57.317 --> 19:00.921
"Mommy, they're gonna
beat me up. Again."

19:01.488 --> 19:04.458
Can you imagine?

19:04.590 --> 19:05.959
Is Rudy popular?

19:06.093 --> 19:08.896
Popular? I don't know about
that. Tell you what I do know.

19:09.163 --> 19:11.065
That old biddy
who lives next door to me

19:11.199 --> 19:13.234
has ten cats in her apartment,

19:13.366 --> 19:15.068
and it stinks to high hell.

19:15.201 --> 19:17.372
You wanna do a video,
do a video on that.

19:24.979 --> 19:26.381
Whatever.

19:28.715 --> 19:30.183
What are you doing?

19:30.851 --> 19:33.053
Hi. Merry Christmas.

19:33.452 --> 19:37.557
I love this song.
Don't you just love this song?

19:38.326 --> 19:41.495
Did you know there's a movie
about the Vienna Boys Choir?

19:41.628 --> 19:45.031
It's a Disney movie,
and it isn't about Christmas.

19:45.165 --> 19:46.666
- Weird, huh?
- No.

19:46.799 --> 19:49.537
They sing a lot of traditional
Christmas songs in it

19:49.670 --> 19:51.239
which makes it better.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.308
Kind of cold out, am I right?

19:54.741 --> 19:56.042
Yeah.

19:56.175 --> 19:58.778
Seems more Christmassy
when it's cold, so.

19:59.046 --> 20:00.280
Yeah, right.

20:00.414 --> 20:02.449
Personally, I don't mind
if it's cold out.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.552
I mean, you can have Christmas
when it's hot

20:04.685 --> 20:06.886
like they have Christmas
on the equator.

20:07.121 --> 20:09.757
They probably have Christmas
in Saudi Arabia.

20:10.022 --> 20:11.625
Well, they should.

20:11.759 --> 20:14.562
But when it's cold out, it just
makes Christmas seem more...

20:15.162 --> 20:16.197
real.

20:16.463 --> 20:20.200
Oh, okay. Well, hey,
Merry Christmas.

20:20.334 --> 20:21.568
It's not Christmas.

20:21.701 --> 20:23.636
Somebody needs
an attitude adjustment.

20:24.003 --> 20:25.238
What did you say?

20:25.472 --> 20:27.841
Merry Christmas, anyway.

20:27.976 --> 20:30.578
What is
his deal with Christmas?

20:30.711 --> 20:32.011
I like Christmas.

20:32.145 --> 20:33.947
In December.
When it's Christmas.

20:34.082 --> 20:36.684
My neighbors leave their
Christmas lights up all year.

20:36.817 --> 20:38.519
They don't turn them on
all year. They're just too lazy

20:38.653 --> 20:40.421
to take them down
when you're supposed to.

20:41.021 --> 20:43.089
I take mine down
right at New Year's.

20:43.222 --> 20:44.692
<i>This is America.</i>

20:44.825 --> 20:46.294
<i>That's how we do things.</i>

21:13.854 --> 21:17.191
Welcome
to Bethlehem, baby Jesus.

21:17.525 --> 21:20.761
We're here to say
Happy birthday to you.

21:20.894 --> 21:23.431
14.99?

21:37.978 --> 21:38.980
Hi.

21:39.113 --> 21:41.414
Oh, I didn't see you.

21:42.316 --> 21:43.817
- What are you doing here?
- Umm...

21:43.951 --> 21:46.854
I was at the Dollar Tree
and I saw you come over here.

21:46.987 --> 21:48.221
You followed me?

21:48.923 --> 21:50.758
- Sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

21:51.692 --> 21:53.126
I like this store.

21:53.359 --> 21:55.061
Yeah. It's cool.

21:57.064 --> 21:59.200
- I come here sometimes.
- Really?

22:00.099 --> 22:01.100
Were you videoing me?

22:01.233 --> 22:03.103
Not really.

22:04.037 --> 22:05.338
Yeah.

22:07.575 --> 22:10.076
I better go.
I'm supposed to help my mom.

22:10.211 --> 22:12.313
- What's wrong with her?
- She's in therapy.

22:12.445 --> 22:14.647
I'm going to help her
move some furniture.

22:14.780 --> 22:16.884
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

22:17.017 --> 22:19.620
I went to a Christmas party
one time in July.

22:19.753 --> 22:21.221
It was weird.

22:22.056 --> 22:23.391
It was fun, though.

22:23.790 --> 22:25.893
<i>Clean up
on the Christmas Aisle.</i>

22:37.738 --> 22:38.872
You want a ride?

22:39.306 --> 22:40.641
I have a car.

22:41.842 --> 22:43.111
I see that.

22:44.010 --> 22:46.114
I can give you a ride home.

22:49.416 --> 22:52.886
It's okay, really.
I get good gas mileage.

23:09.135 --> 23:10.369
Do you want music?

23:10.636 --> 23:13.374
You can play whatever
kind of music you like.

23:23.017 --> 23:25.419
You really like Christmas.

23:42.536 --> 23:45.572
- Wow. Is this your house?
- Yeah.

23:45.705 --> 23:48.509
You really,
really like Christmas.

23:48.642 --> 23:51.746
Isn't it just so beautiful?

23:51.878 --> 23:52.913
It's cool.

23:54.048 --> 23:56.383
- You think so?
- Uh-huh.

23:57.017 --> 23:58.952
What's it like inside?

24:02.455 --> 24:05.725
Wow!

24:08.762 --> 24:10.263
Are you gonna make fun of me?

24:10.396 --> 24:12.832
For what? I like your tree!

24:13.333 --> 24:14.935
- It's cool.
- It's artificial.

24:15.067 --> 24:16.135
It is?

24:16.369 --> 24:18.304
Easy to take care of,
though, huh?

24:18.538 --> 24:21.275
You don't have to take care
of it. It never dies.

24:21.875 --> 24:22.777
Really?

24:24.076 --> 24:25.346
Who's this?

24:26.480 --> 24:28.014
This is Prancer.

24:28.147 --> 24:31.284
Hi, Prancer. You look so cute
with your little antlers.

24:31.684 --> 24:35.087
- Wanna try my cat ears?
- Prancer likes being a reindeer.

24:35.221 --> 24:37.391
Right. Like, with Santa Claus.

24:37.523 --> 24:39.826
- There's Dasher, and Dancer.
- And Prancer.

24:39.960 --> 24:43.029
- And Vixen.
- Comet, and Cupid, and Donner.

24:43.163 --> 24:45.598
- And Blitzen, and you.
- Me?

24:46.066 --> 24:48.468
- Rudolph.
- I identify more with Hermie.

24:48.602 --> 24:49.836
You wanna be a dentist?

24:49.970 --> 24:51.738
You know the Rankin
and Bass classic?

24:51.872 --> 24:53.974
She knows the Rankin
and Bass classic.

24:54.107 --> 24:56.309
Everybody knows "Rudolph
the Red Nose Reindeer."

24:56.442 --> 24:58.478
- It's "nosed."
- What?

24:58.612 --> 25:00.581
You said "nose." It's "nosed."

25:00.714 --> 25:04.183
- "Red-nosed," with a hyphen.
- I thought it was "nose."

25:04.317 --> 25:05.551
It's "nosed."

25:06.420 --> 25:08.656
- You want a Christmas cookie?
- Sure.

25:09.789 --> 25:11.791
I just baked them.

25:11.924 --> 25:13.661
Thank you.

25:15.663 --> 25:16.930
Delicious.

25:17.064 --> 25:19.400
I've never had a guest
here before.

25:19.532 --> 25:21.033
Really? Why?

25:21.167 --> 25:23.536
Most people think I should
put my Christmas things away

25:23.670 --> 25:25.605
after December 25.

25:25.940 --> 25:27.974
I don't. I like it.

25:28.208 --> 25:29.477
You should have a party.

25:29.609 --> 25:31.544
It'd be cool
because it's not Christmas,

25:31.679 --> 25:33.513
except for it is, here.

25:33.881 --> 25:35.983
I guess
it's always Christmas here.

25:36.115 --> 25:37.317
It's funny.

25:38.451 --> 25:39.886
I think it's cute.

25:40.886 --> 25:42.522
You're cute.

25:43.691 --> 25:48.296
She thinks I'm cute!

25:58.204 --> 25:59.539
It's your mom.

26:01.842 --> 26:02.877
Oh.

26:05.612 --> 26:06.846
It's my mom.

26:07.580 --> 26:08.848
You'd better get it.

26:10.115 --> 26:12.052
Hello? Mom?

26:12.987 --> 26:14.455
Yes, I'm on my way.

26:14.888 --> 26:15.855
I have to go.

26:15.990 --> 26:17.424
My mom likes for me

26:17.557 --> 26:19.291
to redecorate her house
for her pretty frequently.

26:19.592 --> 26:21.127
If I had a house,

26:21.260 --> 26:23.763
you'd be the very first one
I'd ask to help me decorate.

26:23.896 --> 26:26.165
Especially Christmas decorating.

26:26.299 --> 26:28.402
It's not Christmas for my mom.

26:28.536 --> 26:32.038
No, I was just saying.
I mean, it's February.

26:32.506 --> 26:34.008
I know it's February.

26:34.141 --> 26:37.044
People always tell me
what month it is all the time.

26:37.277 --> 26:40.014
I can help you rearrange
your mom's furniture.

26:40.547 --> 26:41.648
If you want.

26:41.780 --> 26:44.050
I have nothing better to do.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.893
It doesn't look too cluttered,
does it?

27:26.026 --> 27:28.394
I don't like it to look
like I have too many things.

27:28.528 --> 27:30.529
It looks a lot
like it did before.

27:30.663 --> 27:32.198
Very spacious.

27:32.332 --> 27:33.567
Well, thank you, Clarice.

27:33.700 --> 27:35.602
- Are you dating my son?
- We should go.

27:35.736 --> 27:37.137
- Yeah.
- Well, think about it.

27:37.269 --> 27:39.673
You'd be his first.
He's got that new car smell.

27:39.806 --> 27:42.476
And don't let his eccentricities
put you off, dear.

27:42.608 --> 27:44.110
My therapist says he's harmless.

27:44.243 --> 27:46.779
- Probably.
- Thanks, Mom. Merry Christmas.

27:46.913 --> 27:49.115
That's one of the eccentricities
I was talking about.

27:49.250 --> 27:52.018
It's always Christmas with him.
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas.

27:52.152 --> 27:54.889
He won't even think about
other holidays. I tried.

27:55.021 --> 27:57.456
Well, Happy Valentine's Day.

27:57.590 --> 27:59.659
You see Rudy? Valentine's!

27:59.792 --> 28:02.128
- I like her.
- Thanks, Mom. See you later.

28:02.261 --> 28:03.797
Come on, Clarice.

28:03.931 --> 28:06.466
Run along, you two. It's very
nice to meet you, Clarice.

28:06.599 --> 28:09.702
Rudy, don't screw this up.
Ixnay on the Christmas, 'kay?

28:09.836 --> 28:11.337
Pig Latin.

28:11.471 --> 28:13.507
Maybe you can get to the bottom
of this Christmas fetish.

28:13.640 --> 28:16.276
My therapist calls it a fetish.
His father left at Christmas.

28:16.410 --> 28:18.378
I would never want to think
about Christmas ever again.

28:18.510 --> 28:19.645
In fact I don't.

28:19.779 --> 28:20.814
What's Christmas?
Never heard of it.

28:22.347 --> 28:24.917
Rudy, don't forget about dinner.
You're pretty, Clarice.

28:25.050 --> 28:26.086
Thin!

28:28.821 --> 28:30.890
Cat ears.

28:38.265 --> 28:40.234
So, that was your mom?

28:40.634 --> 28:41.867
Yep.

28:42.402 --> 28:44.269
She, she seems nice.

28:44.671 --> 28:46.841
You don't really
look like her, though.

28:48.041 --> 28:49.175
She's adopted.

28:49.876 --> 28:50.911
Oh.

28:53.212 --> 28:54.248
Okay.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.252
You're different.

28:59.586 --> 29:01.355
- I am?
- You're cool.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.723
I like how you go
against the grain.

29:03.856 --> 29:05.692
Always go against the grain.

29:06.425 --> 29:10.062
- That's what Negan told Carl.
- Negan wasn't cool.

29:10.296 --> 29:11.664
Or Christmassy.

29:12.266 --> 29:15.669
Christmas is the first to go
during a zombie apocalypse.

29:15.970 --> 29:19.072
Without Christmas,
humanity is doomed.

29:19.204 --> 29:20.573
Scary.

29:21.273 --> 29:24.410
Isn't there an episode where
they have Christmas for Carl?

29:24.744 --> 29:27.548
Christmas isn't an episode,
it's a feeling.

29:27.914 --> 29:30.983
Like, Jesus is the reason
for the season.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.919
That's more
of a bumper sticker.

29:33.053 --> 29:34.855
My mom has that on a sweatshirt.

29:34.988 --> 29:37.423
She wears it whenever
she's making the turkey.

29:38.125 --> 29:40.994
- It has turkey stains on it.
- I like turkey.

29:42.128 --> 29:44.597
Is that why you feel
Christmas so deeply?

29:44.730 --> 29:46.133
Because turkey?

29:46.432 --> 29:48.969
- Jesus.
- I'm not religious.

29:49.102 --> 29:50.236
Me neither.

29:50.537 --> 29:53.240
There are some really good
Christian Christmas stories.

29:56.276 --> 29:59.312
- Can I ask you a question?
- Okay.

30:00.145 --> 30:03.082
- It's February.
- We already established that.

30:03.217 --> 30:06.953
Sorry. I know you like Christmas
and everything. Most people do.

30:07.086 --> 30:09.721
But most people don't have
their house all decorated

30:09.855 --> 30:11.290
for Christmas in February.

30:11.424 --> 30:13.225
Why take down all
the beautiful decorations?

30:13.359 --> 30:16.429
- 'Cause Christmas is over.
- It's never over.

30:16.696 --> 30:19.298
Don't you want it
to be special? Like,

30:19.699 --> 30:21.668
I love this pizza.

30:21.801 --> 30:24.837
But if I eat
the same pizza every day,

30:24.971 --> 30:26.405
how can it be special?

30:26.538 --> 30:28.442
What if it's the best pizza?

30:28.942 --> 30:31.077
And you eat it
in the best place?

30:31.211 --> 30:32.211
With your best...

30:32.346 --> 30:33.614
friend.

30:33.747 --> 30:35.515
I guess
that's pretty special.

30:44.791 --> 30:46.925
- Oh.
- I'm supposed to be at work.

30:47.059 --> 30:49.128
I have to pick up Luis' shift.

30:51.030 --> 30:52.966
I could give you a ride.

30:53.700 --> 30:55.102
That would be cool.

30:58.003 --> 31:00.105
You smell like candy canes.

31:00.440 --> 31:01.674
Thanks.

31:07.614 --> 31:09.482
<i>Rudy has never had
a girlfriend.</i>

31:09.883 --> 31:11.317
My therapist thought he was gay.

31:11.451 --> 31:15.623
Clarice? She's hot.
She's a woman. I like women.

31:16.056 --> 31:16.756
Women!

31:17.523 --> 31:20.960
He's different. Different is not
what you want on your team.

31:21.862 --> 31:23.330
I'm going to have to fire him.

31:23.462 --> 31:24.964
You leave Rudy alone.

31:25.097 --> 31:28.101
If you do not leave Rudy alone,
you will be sorry,

31:28.234 --> 31:30.069
and I will talk to the manager.

31:32.338 --> 31:34.374
Clarice is very quiet.

31:34.740 --> 31:36.009
My therapist will say,

31:36.143 --> 31:38.377
"Rudy ought to prefer
a stronger woman."

31:38.510 --> 31:39.879
But at this point, frankly,

31:40.012 --> 31:42.214
I'm surprised
he's brought home a live human.

31:42.348 --> 31:44.850
And not a snowman
or a cinnamon bear.

31:44.984 --> 31:46.986
We ate pizza in the cemetery.

31:47.319 --> 31:49.888
It was wonderful.

31:53.926 --> 31:55.894
Nobody
ever kissed me before.

31:56.128 --> 31:59.132
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything.

32:31.597 --> 32:33.532
When do you think
was the exact moment

32:33.665 --> 32:35.167
that Ebenezer changed his heart?

32:35.301 --> 32:38.670
When he was remembering his life
or when he saw his death?

32:38.805 --> 32:40.006
Hmm?

32:40.405 --> 32:41.442
Never mind.

32:46.480 --> 32:47.980
Just like everybody else.

32:51.651 --> 32:54.188
Oh, yeah. Scrooge, duh!

33:16.308 --> 33:18.177
<i>I wish I was cool.</i>

33:21.381 --> 33:22.516
I wish I was cool.

33:24.785 --> 33:27.086
Merry Christmas.

33:27.987 --> 33:30.323
Oh, really?

33:30.856 --> 33:32.224
I wasn't expecting that.

33:32.357 --> 33:34.193
- People don't usually...
- Super cool guy here.

33:34.327 --> 33:36.663
- Not just my opinion.
- For sure.

33:36.797 --> 33:38.865
You probably noticed
my cool clothes.

33:38.999 --> 33:40.733
Literally
everything is a cool brand.

33:40.866 --> 33:44.704
Anthropologie, Aeropostale,
old school magic sizzle.

33:44.837 --> 33:47.507
- I mean, you look amazing.
- I know.

33:47.641 --> 33:49.042
Also, I do super cool things,

33:49.174 --> 33:51.711
like kayaking
and grownup dodgeball.

33:51.845 --> 33:54.047
- I can't even.
- Can't even with what?

33:54.181 --> 33:57.517
Exactly! And I use phrases
like that with total confidence.

33:57.650 --> 34:00.086
All. The. Time.

34:00.453 --> 34:02.288
You really are cool.

34:02.422 --> 34:03.923
Uh-uh.
That's why I'm so popular.

34:04.057 --> 34:06.058
I encourage you to be the best,

34:06.192 --> 34:09.295
most authentic version
of Rudy you can be.

34:09.695 --> 34:10.998
You know my name?

34:11.297 --> 34:13.297
I'm just as surprised
as you are.

34:13.632 --> 34:17.202
- I must be special.
- Is that your Christmas wish?

34:17.503 --> 34:18.670
To be special?

34:18.804 --> 34:20.272
What are you, millennial?

34:20.407 --> 34:23.141
I don't really know.
I think I'm Gen X.

34:23.275 --> 34:24.476
Boomer.

34:24.610 --> 34:26.746
So Boomer, tell me.
What is it you really want?

34:26.880 --> 34:30.284
I kinda wish I was more popular.
People don't really like me.

34:30.416 --> 34:33.786
I know. It's weird
how truly unpopular you are.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.821
Considering how much
you love Christmas

34:35.954 --> 34:37.523
and keep it going all year.

34:37.922 --> 34:39.025
And the way you dress.

34:39.157 --> 34:40.793
- You know, like that.
- Right?

34:40.927 --> 34:44.763
It must be something else
about you that people hate.

34:44.896 --> 34:46.766
Hate? That's a strong word.

34:46.900 --> 34:49.068
- Seriously?
- Fine.

34:49.668 --> 34:53.373
Well, don't jump off a bridge,
if that's what you're thinking.

34:53.507 --> 34:55.007
Like George Bailey.

34:55.141 --> 34:57.909
- Have you tried just being you?
- No. It doesn't work.

34:58.143 --> 34:59.645
It worked with Clarice.

34:59.778 --> 35:02.181
She'd probably think I was cool
if I took up kayaking.

35:02.315 --> 35:05.318
It's not about kayaking.
It's about what's in you.

35:05.452 --> 35:07.521
Isn't that your whole thing
with Christmas?

35:07.653 --> 35:09.822
How it brings out
the best in everyone?

35:09.956 --> 35:11.490
That's all you gotta do.

35:11.625 --> 35:16.295
Believe in yourself as much
as you believe in Christmas.

35:16.429 --> 35:18.831
Being cool isn't about
being cool.

35:18.965 --> 35:20.434
So, be cool.

35:20.967 --> 35:22.501
Be cool.

35:38.217 --> 35:40.353
<i>Lovely around here,
isn't it?</i>

35:40.487 --> 35:43.056
<i>I call it Christmas Town.</i>

35:43.188 --> 35:46.291
- Better known as the North Pole.
- Rankin and Bass.

35:46.425 --> 35:48.927
- The Christmas Tree Forest.
- Yep.

35:49.061 --> 35:50.563
Here's where we grow them.

35:50.697 --> 35:53.066
Are we done quoting "Rudolph,
the Red Nose Reindeer?"

35:53.199 --> 35:54.934
"Nosed."

35:55.068 --> 35:56.436
It's spider-webby out here.

35:56.568 --> 35:59.105
But it seems more natural
when it's decorated,

35:59.239 --> 36:01.240
don't you think? Hey, cool guy,

36:01.373 --> 36:04.476
do you think the woodland
creatures know it's Christmas?

36:04.610 --> 36:05.978
Why don't you ask them?

36:06.378 --> 36:08.847
- Use the magic scarf.
- This?

36:09.181 --> 36:11.650
When you wear it,
you can wish for anything.

36:11.784 --> 36:13.052
But it's yours.

36:13.186 --> 36:15.521
I found it on the train.
It's kind of sticky.

36:15.655 --> 36:18.257
They should be better
about cleaning those floors.

36:18.590 --> 36:20.592
I sense you tried
to give it back to me,

36:20.726 --> 36:22.161
but it had big gulp on it,

36:22.295 --> 36:24.164
so now you'll have it
professionally dry cleaned.

36:24.297 --> 36:26.798
And then you'll ride the train,
who knows how many days

36:26.932 --> 36:28.001
until you see me again.

36:28.134 --> 36:29.568
Without a word,

36:29.702 --> 36:32.304
you'll return it to me
and even though we've never met,

36:32.438 --> 36:35.942
we'll become best friends
and maybe lovers.

36:36.775 --> 36:38.844
Yeah, I don't think I'm...

36:39.177 --> 36:40.813
- I don't know.
- I don't either.

36:41.447 --> 36:42.981
This is your fantasy, not mine.

36:43.115 --> 36:44.483
- Give me my scarf.
- No.

36:44.717 --> 36:47.454
- I'll have it cleaned.
- You are selfless and pure.

36:47.586 --> 36:48.621
Thank you.

36:48.755 --> 36:50.423
Anything you want,
just ask the scarf.

36:50.556 --> 36:51.524
Anything.

36:51.657 --> 36:53.025
- But watch out.
- What?

36:53.592 --> 36:54.594
Watch out!

36:54.726 --> 36:55.929
- Oh, hey.
- <i>Watch out!</i>

36:56.061 --> 36:57.262
Watch out!

36:57.396 --> 36:58.664
No, it's okay. I'm all right.

36:58.797 --> 37:01.333
I'm the one
with mental problems. Right?

37:01.467 --> 37:04.503
- Right? I'm the crazy one!
- Thank you!

37:05.237 --> 37:07.540
Sorry. I didn't see you.

37:09.208 --> 37:12.545
Be safe. Have fun.
Have a nice day.

37:12.679 --> 37:14.414
Don't get hit by a car.

37:14.780 --> 37:15.981
Great kid.

37:16.114 --> 37:17.383
Hey, mister.

37:18.318 --> 37:19.452
My mom says I'm supposed

37:19.585 --> 37:21.153
- to apologize to you.
- What for?

37:21.288 --> 37:22.856
She says it's not nice
to throw things at you.

37:22.989 --> 37:24.691
You know, 'cause you're mental.

37:24.824 --> 37:27.693
Oh, okay. I guess.

37:31.898 --> 37:34.300
Sorry, not mental.
She says you're nice,

37:34.434 --> 37:36.569
and I should stop
calling you a weirdo,

37:36.702 --> 37:38.070
or I'll get in trouble.

37:38.204 --> 37:40.073
Okay, well, yeah,
don't get in trouble.

37:40.572 --> 37:42.674
I gotta go. I'll see you later.

37:42.909 --> 37:44.210
Hi.

37:44.342 --> 37:46.980
Hi. It's a beautiful day,
isn't it?

37:47.112 --> 37:49.548
Yes, it is!

37:50.215 --> 37:52.317
That is a lovely scarf.

37:52.585 --> 37:54.787
Yes, it is. Looks great on you.

37:55.054 --> 37:56.322
Thank you.

37:57.389 --> 38:00.292
I did what you said.
Can I get my bike back now?

38:03.561 --> 38:07.467
<i>It's a magic scarf.</i>

38:17.076 --> 38:19.679
At least
you think I'm cool, right?

38:24.717 --> 38:29.554
- Hi, Mom. Merry Christmas.
- <i>Am I a terrible mother?</i>

38:29.688 --> 38:32.991
- What?
- <i>You were such a good boy.</i>

38:33.126 --> 38:35.228
- You're drunk.
- No!

38:35.728 --> 38:36.963
Yes.

38:37.097 --> 38:41.501
It's all my fault, isn't it!
That's what you think!

38:41.634 --> 38:42.601
Margaritas?

38:42.902 --> 38:43.903
<i>Banana smoothie!</i>

38:44.036 --> 38:45.404
Margarita.

38:45.538 --> 38:48.641
Did you want something?
Absolution? Confirmation?

38:48.775 --> 38:51.242
Validation?
What can I do for you?

38:51.376 --> 38:53.478
You were such a good boy.

38:53.913 --> 38:54.981
<i>So...</i>

38:55.114 --> 38:56.748
<i>boring though.</i>

38:57.449 --> 39:00.886
<i>Just this dull,
little thing in the corner</i>

39:01.019 --> 39:03.155
<i>playing with a nativity set.</i>

39:03.289 --> 39:04.491
Thanks, Mom!

39:04.623 --> 39:07.993
As if constantly
replaying Christmas

39:08.126 --> 39:09.895
<i>would bring your father back.</i>

39:10.028 --> 39:11.264
For the record,

39:11.398 --> 39:14.067
everything is not always
about dad leaving.

39:14.668 --> 39:16.836
Yes, he abandoned us
on Christmas day.

39:16.969 --> 39:19.805
<i>That's just perfect,
Donna. Merry Christmas!</i>

39:19.938 --> 39:21.173
Santa!

39:21.840 --> 39:23.041
Okay.

39:23.576 --> 39:26.679
Now that I say it out loud,
maybe it is a little about dad.

39:26.813 --> 39:30.182
<i>Therapy
has done wonders for me.</i>

39:30.317 --> 39:34.219
I am very conscious
of my patterns,

39:34.353 --> 39:37.356
and I'm not a slave to them.

39:37.824 --> 39:38.858
Anymore.

39:38.992 --> 39:40.593
- Right.
- <i>I've learned,</i>

39:41.094 --> 39:45.465
<i>that doing the same thing
more than once</i>

39:45.931 --> 39:50.269
is the very definition
of insanity.

39:51.871 --> 39:53.740
I don't think
that's the exact quote,

39:53.873 --> 39:57.209
<i>but you're right. I'm in a loo.
I do it to myself.</i>

39:57.909 --> 39:59.178
I realized that.

39:59.778 --> 40:04.016
But, Christmas is the only thing
that makes me happy.

40:04.983 --> 40:09.655
I'm sorry that's dull for you,
but it's my loop.

40:10.856 --> 40:12.291
I own it.

40:12.625 --> 40:14.728
What do you mean
you own a loop? What is that?

40:14.860 --> 40:16.795
We're all in a loop
of some sort.

40:17.963 --> 40:19.766
We make our own loops.

40:19.900 --> 40:22.235
You have your binge
and purge loop.

40:22.534 --> 40:24.869
Don't make this about me.

40:26.672 --> 40:29.174
<i>I have no idea
what you're talking about.</i>

40:29.842 --> 40:33.778
<i>My therapist says that
my deep state of denial</i>

40:33.913 --> 40:36.715
prevents me from truly
understanding things.

40:36.849 --> 40:39.986
Sounds like a breakthrough.
I gotta go.

40:40.420 --> 40:44.023
He says there's something
very wrong with you!

40:44.289 --> 40:48.360
I'm just relieved to know
that it's your father's fault!

40:48.927 --> 40:52.065
We thought you'd never
find a nice girl.

40:52.199 --> 40:54.800
- Like Clarice.
- <i>Clarice found me.</i>

40:54.934 --> 40:56.403
I love you.

41:01.072 --> 41:02.375
That's new.

41:28.166 --> 41:29.268
Hey!

41:29.400 --> 41:31.236
Hey! Hey, mister!

41:31.371 --> 41:33.306
Excuse me! Hey! I was...

41:33.438 --> 41:35.974
Huh? What do you want?
I didn't steal it.

41:36.108 --> 41:37.242
It was just lying there.

41:37.376 --> 41:38.610
No. Hey.

41:38.744 --> 41:41.279
- I was...
- Spit it out. Are you mental?

41:41.414 --> 41:43.116
- I got a knife!
- No! Hey.

41:44.150 --> 41:47.119
I was almost hit by a car
a little while ago.

41:47.552 --> 41:49.020
You yelled at me.

41:49.320 --> 41:50.489
Woke me up.

41:50.722 --> 41:52.991
Yeah. That's right.
Keep your eyes open.

41:53.592 --> 41:54.893
I bought you a present.

41:55.260 --> 41:58.230
- Why is it in Christmas paper?
- It's a Christmas present.

41:58.530 --> 41:59.831
It's not Christmas.

41:59.965 --> 42:01.334
Here.

42:04.704 --> 42:05.938
Aren't you gonna open it?

42:06.806 --> 42:08.942
- There's something in it?
- Yeah.

42:09.242 --> 42:10.376
You got the receipt?

42:10.510 --> 42:12.445
In case I don't like it,
I can return it.

42:16.081 --> 42:17.148
Well, it's...

42:17.516 --> 42:18.851
It's a bunch of socks.

42:18.985 --> 42:20.820
I thought maybe you could use
some new ones.

42:20.954 --> 42:21.988
I like socks.

42:22.454 --> 42:26.192
- I don't have any clean ones.
- Well, cool.

42:26.692 --> 42:28.628
Now you have some clean,
new socks.

42:28.760 --> 42:30.329
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:30.463 --> 42:32.498
Who do you think you are?
Will Ferrell?

42:32.630 --> 42:34.634
Hey, I was wondering,

42:34.900 --> 42:37.303
do you think
you might wanna have dinner?

42:55.221 --> 42:56.755
<i>♪ The clothes I wear ♪</i>

42:56.889 --> 42:59.492
- <i>♪ The magic in my hair... ♪</i>
- What up, Brock?

42:59.958 --> 43:00.993
Text me.

43:03.628 --> 43:05.230
Hey, how's it going?

43:05.364 --> 43:06.632
Merry Christmas.

43:06.766 --> 43:10.970
Got these threads
at Anthropologie, yo.

43:11.103 --> 43:14.239
<i>♪ I can't even ♪</i>

43:14.373 --> 43:17.710

43:17.842 --> 43:20.980

- Hey, everybody!

43:25.650 --> 43:28.855
Merry Christmas!

43:28.987 --> 43:31.957
Hey, man. How about
an icy brew for your bro?

43:32.391 --> 43:33.960
You got a magic eight ball,
or you gonna tell me

43:34.094 --> 43:35.661
what kind of icy brew
you want, bro?

43:35.795 --> 43:37.363
Right on!

43:37.496 --> 43:39.898
Hey, you never talked to me
before. Must be the new Rudy.

43:40.032 --> 43:43.301
Must be. The old Rudy comes here
and usually asks for a Rainier.

43:43.434 --> 43:44.703
How fly is that?

43:44.836 --> 43:47.672
- Super fly. What do you want?
- Rainier!

43:47.806 --> 43:50.808
And two shots of whiskey!

43:50.943 --> 43:54.313
Whiskey!

43:54.447 --> 43:55.681
Ladies.

43:55.815 --> 43:58.150
Merry Christmas!

44:02.655 --> 44:05.158
Ladies! What's the what?

44:05.492 --> 44:07.794
- What's the what?
- That's hysterical!

44:07.927 --> 44:10.028
- You are amazing.
- We were talking.

44:10.262 --> 44:12.598
Cool, what's on the agen?

44:12.731 --> 44:14.400
Getting to know you, obviously.

44:14.532 --> 44:16.701
I love men
who talk in abbreviations.

44:16.835 --> 44:18.336
It means you're
busy and important,

44:18.471 --> 44:20.938
and you don't have time
to waste on a single syllable.

44:21.072 --> 44:23.675
Do you come here often? Because
this is my first time here.

44:23.809 --> 44:26.778
But if you come here often,
I'm gonna come here often.

44:26.911 --> 44:30.782
Take it easy, I'm a slow ride
and I don't wanna miss a thing.

44:30.916 --> 44:34.653
Eagles, Foghat and Aerosmith
in one sentence. I'm swooning!

44:34.786 --> 44:36.922
Nice shirt. This scarf is hot!

44:37.056 --> 44:38.691
Where'd ya get it, Aeropostale?

44:38.824 --> 44:40.960
No! I found it
on the floor of a train.

44:41.092 --> 44:42.427
That is so cool!

44:42.561 --> 44:44.764
You're the coolest person
I've ever met.

44:44.896 --> 44:46.766
I've always been cool.
Just nobody noticed.

44:46.898 --> 44:48.167
I was on the DL.

44:48.300 --> 44:50.601
I should probably go
to the little girls room

44:50.735 --> 44:51.938
and freshen up. Would...

44:52.070 --> 44:54.373
- Would you excuse me?
- What?

44:54.507 --> 44:57.076
- I said excuse me.
- No problemo.

44:57.208 --> 44:58.777
I know what's up.

44:58.911 --> 45:01.481
You ladies are going to talk
amongst yourselves, and decide

45:01.614 --> 45:03.949
- who's the lucky gal tonight.
- Seriously?

45:04.083 --> 45:05.985
No fight. It's all right,
all right, all right?

45:06.117 --> 45:09.054
Promise? You're too pretty,
and there's enough Rudy!

45:09.188 --> 45:10.557
For everybody!

45:10.690 --> 45:12.791
I've never seen someone bomb
like that before.

45:12.925 --> 45:15.428
Check it out. I'm having a party
tomorrow night at my place.

45:15.561 --> 45:17.429
I just decided. 8:00 <i>p.m.</i>

45:17.563 --> 45:20.800
I'll be there. Young, dumb
and full of Christmas spirit.

45:20.932 --> 45:22.302
- You know what I mean?
- No.

45:22.434 --> 45:23.603
Right on.

45:23.936 --> 45:25.704
You just decided
you're having a party

45:25.838 --> 45:27.407
but you already had invitations?

45:27.539 --> 45:32.010
Hey, everyone.
I'm a wild and crazy guy.

45:32.143 --> 45:33.912
Don't you watch
<i>Saturday Night Live?</i>

45:34.045 --> 45:37.482
<i>SNL's</i> totally my scene.
It's so cool!

45:37.782 --> 45:39.851
Hey, man. What's up?

45:40.085 --> 45:41.721
You look almost
as good as me tonight.

45:41.853 --> 45:43.455
We're like two elves on a shelf.

45:43.590 --> 45:45.057
You know what that's from,
right?

45:45.291 --> 45:48.795
The movie <i>Elf on a shelf.</i>
Check it out. Blu-ray, my place.

45:48.927 --> 45:51.696
Or we could just Netflix
and chill. That'd be cool.

45:52.264 --> 45:55.001
What are you doing, man?

45:55.134 --> 45:57.469
Being amazing.
What are you doing?

45:57.737 --> 45:59.672
Your amazingness
is freaking everybody out.

45:59.804 --> 46:01.973
- More than usual somehow.
- Hey, it's cool.

46:02.108 --> 46:05.010
- You see this scarf? It's magic!
- Really?

46:05.143 --> 46:06.612
I do not claim
to know how it works,

46:06.746 --> 46:08.313
but it makes me extremely cool.

46:08.447 --> 46:10.048
Bulletproof. Zero awkward.

46:10.182 --> 46:11.583
Yeah, I noticed.

46:11.717 --> 46:13.152
Hey, nice of you to check in.

46:13.284 --> 46:16.187
Look, I'm having a party.
It's an event, 8 p.

46:16.322 --> 46:18.891
We're filling up fast,
but you can tend bar.

46:19.259 --> 46:21.693
JK.
I'm keeping it real.

46:21.827 --> 46:24.530
Almost sick enough to want
to see that train wreck.

46:24.663 --> 46:26.164
Hells yeah! My digits.

46:26.298 --> 46:29.001
I'mma cruise over here and
check out this chessboard thang.

46:29.134 --> 46:30.036
Lates!

46:32.336 --> 46:33.806
What up, my dudes!

46:33.940 --> 46:35.974
Let me show you
how the chessing is done.

46:36.108 --> 46:40.011
Oh, look, you're playing with
the little Santa Claus people

46:40.144 --> 46:42.114
who lives
in Santa Claus village.

46:42.248 --> 46:44.550
And then you got
the Mrs. Santa Claus

46:44.682 --> 46:46.719
and she wants to move over here.

46:46.853 --> 46:49.322
Yo, kayaking is more my thing.

46:51.757 --> 46:53.525
Merry Christmas!

46:53.659 --> 46:57.863
Hey, you guys are hardcore.
You wanna play adult dodgeball?

46:57.996 --> 47:00.732
Go home, man.
Quit being so weird.

47:02.367 --> 47:03.603
Nailed it!

47:04.570 --> 47:05.871
I almost felt bad for him.

47:06.271 --> 47:09.008
But at the same time,
it was pretty spectacular.

47:09.275 --> 47:11.143
So he kinda gained
a little respect.

49:13.565 --> 49:14.967
We're out of ketchup!

49:15.099 --> 49:17.469
Can one of you go in the kitchen
and get me some ketchup?

49:17.603 --> 49:19.505
Kitchen. Now.

49:20.204 --> 49:23.208
How many does it take
to go get me some ketchup?

49:23.342 --> 49:24.443
Hmm.

49:26.110 --> 49:28.846
Somebody wanna tell me
what that was all about?

49:28.981 --> 49:30.382
It was on the floor.

49:30.514 --> 49:32.217
I'm supposed to pick stuff
off the floor, right?

49:32.351 --> 49:34.320
- You were going to keep it.
- That's not your business.

49:34.452 --> 49:35.721
It's not yours.

49:35.855 --> 49:37.755
- Maybe I dropped it.
- You didn't drop it!

49:38.023 --> 49:40.325
Miss Loving dropped it.
She always drops it.

49:40.458 --> 49:42.127
How do you know
she didn't drop it for me?

49:42.260 --> 49:44.429
Maybe she likes to see me
bend over and pick it up.

49:44.563 --> 49:46.999
You're gonna take that one joy
away from her?

49:47.132 --> 49:48.533
- Ew.
- All right.

49:48.668 --> 49:50.501
- Give it...
- Boss!

49:50.768 --> 49:52.471
I can help.

49:53.206 --> 49:56.508
Let this scarf
represent friendship,

49:56.641 --> 49:58.277
and harmony between you.

49:58.411 --> 50:01.780
Let the raging waters
of discord calm,

50:01.914 --> 50:04.717
and may you both find peace.

50:04.849 --> 50:07.085
Love one another.

50:07.385 --> 50:09.721
Man, you never say nothing
except Merry Christmas,

50:09.855 --> 50:11.891
and when you do,
it's a hippie wedding?

50:12.190 --> 50:13.692
I thought it was nice.

50:13.826 --> 50:15.193
- It was stupid.
- You're stupid.

50:15.327 --> 50:16.862
- Your face is stupid.
- Enough!

50:16.994 --> 50:18.563
Get back to work.

50:18.797 --> 50:19.999
Do not talk to each other.

50:20.132 --> 50:22.867
If I see you
even look at each other,

50:23.001 --> 50:25.304
- you're both fired.
- No negativity.

50:25.436 --> 50:27.405
Not at Christmas.

50:27.539 --> 50:30.042
I'm having a Christmas party.

50:30.175 --> 50:32.010
Tomorrow night at eight.

50:32.311 --> 50:34.579
- God.
- And you're all invited.

50:35.414 --> 50:39.785
It's going to be super cool,
and really fun!

50:40.117 --> 50:42.487
- BYOB?
- I'll take care of everything!

50:42.621 --> 50:46.692
I have tons of eggnog,
and I'll make mulled wine.

50:46.824 --> 50:49.727
We can have Christmas cookies
and a cheese log.

50:49.961 --> 50:52.931
We can string cranberries
and popcorn,

50:53.065 --> 50:54.934
and sing Christmas carols.

50:55.067 --> 50:59.304
We're going to have so much fun.
You're going to love it!

50:59.871 --> 51:02.041
Eight o' clock, and best of all,

51:02.273 --> 51:07.346
you get to meet all
of my really cool friends.

51:07.480 --> 51:10.615
My other friends,
because you guys...

51:11.016 --> 51:12.985
are my best friends.

51:13.585 --> 51:15.253
I love you guys.

51:15.721 --> 51:17.356
Clarice especially.

51:18.123 --> 51:20.025
I'd throw a lasso
around the moon

51:20.159 --> 51:22.260
and pull it down
for you, Clarice.

51:22.960 --> 51:25.330

Goodness, you're in a hurry.

52:36.302 --> 52:38.303
I have to get ready
for my big party.

52:38.436 --> 52:39.872
- Are you having a party?
- Yes!

52:40.005 --> 52:42.407
How delightful!
What's the occasion?

52:42.541 --> 52:43.509
Having...

52:43.775 --> 52:44.777
friends.

52:45.376 --> 52:47.211
You wanna come? Please come.

52:47.346 --> 52:50.715
It'll be super cool
and really fun!

52:50.983 --> 52:52.784
Tomorrow night at eight.

52:53.117 --> 52:54.386
See you then!

52:56.588 --> 52:58.223
- Hi! Oh.
- Hey.

52:58.356 --> 53:00.692
Can I have the wreath
if it falls on the ground again?

53:00.826 --> 53:01.860
Yeah, sure!

53:02.460 --> 53:04.628
Hey, I was wondering
about that dinner.

53:04.862 --> 53:06.197
I'm busy. I've got plans.

53:06.331 --> 53:08.701
My mom orders
from really nice restaurants!

53:08.833 --> 53:09.967
Okay.

53:10.101 --> 53:11.369
It's Valentine's for her,

53:11.503 --> 53:13.405
and I thought maybe
it was for you too.

53:13.639 --> 53:16.307
- It's not Valentine's for you?
- For me it's Christmas.

53:16.440 --> 53:18.309
- That's weird. I'm busy.
- Oh.

53:18.443 --> 53:21.378
Well, I'm having a party at my
house tomorrow night at eight.

53:21.512 --> 53:24.215
If you're not busy, maybe
you can come to that instead.

53:24.349 --> 53:26.285
- Why?
- It's Christmas!

53:26.418 --> 53:28.287
- No, it's not.
- Okay, well.

53:28.420 --> 53:30.422
If you wanna come,
you know where I live.

53:30.556 --> 53:32.891
If the wreath falls down again,
I get it, right?

53:33.025 --> 53:34.626
- Yeah!
- Hey.

53:35.092 --> 53:36.694
Is there something wrong
with mom?

53:36.829 --> 53:37.930
She's lonely.

53:38.063 --> 53:39.432
Is there something wrong
with you?

53:39.565 --> 53:42.168
We all have something wrong
with us, don't we?

53:42.501 --> 53:43.368
That's true.

54:12.931 --> 54:14.900
Welcome, friends!

54:15.034 --> 54:16.902
Welcome to my home.

- Hi, Clarice. Come in.
- Hi.

58:55.213 --> 58:57.148
- Am I the first one here?
- Yeah.

58:57.416 --> 58:59.182
Everyone else is on their way.

58:59.583 --> 59:02.153
- Your house looks really nice.
- Thanks.

59:02.688 --> 59:05.556
- May I offer you an eggnog?
- Do you have anything else?

59:05.690 --> 59:07.893
- Punch.
- Okay. Thanks.

59:17.436 --> 59:19.405
Were are you able to find
the place okay?

59:19.538 --> 59:22.039
- I've been here before.
- Right.

59:22.173 --> 59:25.277
It's just it's getting late, and
I thought everybody might be...

59:25.411 --> 59:26.878
having a hard time
finding my house.

59:27.012 --> 59:29.181
It's got Christmas lights
all over it,

59:29.313 --> 59:31.349
so it's pretty easy to spot.

59:32.351 --> 59:35.521
- I brought you something.
- You didn't have to do that.

59:35.653 --> 59:37.556
It's Valentine's tomorrow, so...

59:37.688 --> 59:40.291
- This is a Christmas party.
- I know.

59:40.726 --> 59:42.594
Anyway, this is for you.

59:42.726 --> 59:44.862
I thought
you could be my Valentine,

59:44.996 --> 59:47.699
since it's almost
Valentine's and...

59:47.998 --> 59:49.434
I like you.

59:50.135 --> 59:51.770
I made eggnog.

59:52.336 --> 59:54.539
I feel embarrassed. I should go.

59:54.672 --> 59:57.342
Go where?

01:00:01.545 --> 01:00:03.114
I've never done that before.

01:00:03.715 --> 01:00:04.882
I never went up to a guy

01:00:05.016 --> 01:00:07.385
and asked him
to be my Valentine.

01:00:07.818 --> 01:00:09.487
You don't have to be
my Valentine,

01:00:09.621 --> 01:00:11.423
but that was really hard for me.

01:00:11.556 --> 01:00:13.425
I just thought you liked me,
too, is all.

01:00:13.557 --> 01:00:14.693
I do.

01:00:14.927 --> 01:00:17.396
- But Christmas...
- What's the big deal?

01:00:17.996 --> 01:00:19.030
I mean...

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:22.533
I get it. It's a Christmas
party, obviously.

01:00:22.967 --> 01:00:24.603
But, am I not
even supposed to mention

01:00:24.735 --> 01:00:26.137
that it's really
Valentine's Day?

01:00:26.271 --> 01:00:28.306
That's kind of where
it gets weird, Rudy.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.474
- You think I'm weird, too?
- Yeah.

01:00:30.974 --> 01:00:33.411
That's why I like you.
I mean, fine.

01:00:33.545 --> 01:00:34.813
Pretend it's Christmas
if you want.

01:00:34.945 --> 01:00:37.581
- Pretend?
- Yes, pretend. It's February.

01:00:37.715 --> 01:00:40.751
I know Christmas is your jam,
and that's quirky cool,

01:00:41.085 --> 01:00:46.057
but Christmas is December 25th,
not February 13th.

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:48.893
What do I have to do
to make you understand?

01:00:49.027 --> 01:00:52.231
To make everyone understand
Christmas is not a day?

01:00:52.364 --> 01:00:53.697
Yes it is!

01:00:54.132 --> 01:00:55.967
You can celebrate Christmas
whenever you want,

01:00:56.099 --> 01:00:58.502
but that doesn't mean
it's not Valentine's Day.

01:00:58.637 --> 01:01:00.806
- Tomorrow!
- Valentine's is fake.

01:01:00.938 --> 01:01:03.040
It's made up
by a greeting card company.

01:01:03.173 --> 01:01:06.510
Oh. Sorry Valentine's
isn't as authentic

01:01:06.643 --> 01:01:08.312
as your February Christmas party

01:01:08.447 --> 01:01:10.114
with your cheese log,
and eggnog,

01:01:10.248 --> 01:01:12.483
and your shopping mall of
presents under your fake tree!

01:01:12.617 --> 01:01:14.286
It's what's in your heart
that counts,

01:01:14.418 --> 01:01:16.020
not what's under your tree.

01:01:19.456 --> 01:01:21.192
And that tree is awesome!

01:01:26.764 --> 01:01:28.099

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.628
You know what?

01:01:57.762 --> 01:02:00.499
Don't lasso for the moon for me.
I don't want it.

01:02:01.065 --> 01:02:03.166

<i>♪ I'd find my friend ♪</i>

01:05:38.949 --> 01:05:41.919
- Well, that catgirl showed up.
- Oh.

01:05:42.586 --> 01:05:44.088
I didn't see you there.

01:05:44.956 --> 01:05:46.691
What are you doing here?

01:05:46.824 --> 01:05:48.658
I could ask you the same thing.
I didn't.

01:05:48.793 --> 01:05:50.428
I know what you're doing.

01:05:50.695 --> 01:05:52.731
- You gonna jump?
- Why not?

01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:55.199
Everybody hates me.

01:05:56.068 --> 01:05:58.169
The whole world
would just be better off

01:05:58.302 --> 01:06:00.605
if I never said
Merry Christmas again.

01:06:00.838 --> 01:06:03.141
Hey! Thanks for the socks.

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:05.076
You're welcome.

01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:07.512
Merry Christmas.

01:06:07.746 --> 01:06:10.048
They keep my feet warm,
I wash them out in the river.

01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:11.449
Takes a while to dry.

01:06:12.684 --> 01:06:14.486
I can get you some more.

01:06:14.985 --> 01:06:16.887
- It's okay.
- It's nothing.

01:06:17.021 --> 01:06:18.456
It's not nothing.

01:06:18.822 --> 01:06:20.025
Not to me.

01:06:20.958 --> 01:06:22.826
A lot of people don't think
the way you do.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.695
Don't think about
helping people.

01:06:25.228 --> 01:06:27.932
Sometimes I bunch them up
into a sock pillow.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.534
A bit dangerous though.

01:06:29.668 --> 01:06:31.603
Can't nobody steal them
if they're on your feet.

01:06:31.735 --> 01:06:33.371
They'll steal your pillow,
though.

01:06:34.072 --> 01:06:35.506
Who would steal from you?

01:06:36.007 --> 01:06:38.242
You're worse off than me.
You have nothing.

01:06:38.376 --> 01:06:40.078
What you mean
I don't got nothing?

01:06:40.211 --> 01:06:42.514
I got stuff.
I got everything I need.

01:06:42.646 --> 01:06:44.681
The ones who steal are
the ones who don't got nothing.

01:06:44.815 --> 01:06:45.916
I got everything.

01:06:46.284 --> 01:06:48.219
It falls on the ground,
it's mine.

01:06:48.452 --> 01:06:50.422
See? I love this wreath.

01:06:50.855 --> 01:06:52.090
Okay.

01:06:53.224 --> 01:06:54.759
I mean,
I don't have a fancy house,

01:06:54.893 --> 01:06:57.161
all fixed up
like it's Christmas.

01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:58.796
Or a girlfriend.

01:06:59.496 --> 01:07:00.798
I used to have a wife.

01:07:01.532 --> 01:07:03.768
She didn't look like
a cat, though.

01:07:06.137 --> 01:07:07.705
It's Valentine's Day.

01:07:08.405 --> 01:07:11.009
- You know that, don't you?
- I know!

01:07:11.141 --> 01:07:12.942
Okay. Well, excuse me.

01:07:13.577 --> 01:07:17.315
Don't seem like you do.
At least I know what day it is.

01:07:17.447 --> 01:07:18.250
It's today.

01:07:18.483 --> 01:07:20.418
I got that much.

01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:22.554
I know what I am.

01:07:23.086 --> 01:07:24.556
I know who I am.

01:07:24.889 --> 01:07:26.224
I got that much, too.

01:07:26.358 --> 01:07:28.126
I'll tell you something else.

01:07:28.592 --> 01:07:29.994
I know who you are.

01:07:30.494 --> 01:07:31.695
Who am I?

01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:33.999
You're the one who's
about to jump off a bridge.

01:07:37.134 --> 01:07:38.903
That water's cold, you know.

01:07:40.637 --> 01:07:42.539
Here, take this.

01:07:42.672 --> 01:07:43.875
I want you to have it.

01:07:44.007 --> 01:07:45.208
- Don't get it wet, either.
- It's...

01:07:45.342 --> 01:07:47.411
- Taco Bell hot sauce.
- Shh.

01:07:47.545 --> 01:07:50.648
You want somebody to steal it?
It's for you. It's a gift.

01:07:51.614 --> 01:07:54.151
Makes everything you put it on
taste delicious.

01:07:54.784 --> 01:07:55.987
It's magic.

01:07:56.753 --> 01:07:58.889
- Thank you.
- Listen, son.

01:07:59.489 --> 01:08:02.993
I never saw anybody try as hard
as you to believe in people.

01:08:03.527 --> 01:08:05.195
I'm not very good
at that myself.

01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:07.599
You take after your momma,
I guess.

01:08:08.898 --> 01:08:10.034
You're a good boy.

01:08:10.166 --> 01:08:11.435
That's not enough.

01:08:11.568 --> 01:08:13.737
You don't need
to be no better than that.

01:08:14.371 --> 01:08:16.805
Daddy should have told you that
a long time ago.

01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:19.277
Do you forgive him?

01:08:19.609 --> 01:08:20.912
My dad?

01:08:21.412 --> 01:08:22.447
Yeah.

01:08:23.014 --> 01:08:24.314
I guess.

01:08:24.715 --> 01:08:25.951
That's good.

01:08:26.817 --> 01:08:27.984
That's real good.

01:08:28.618 --> 01:08:30.322
That's how you get out
of them chains.

01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:33.490
Forgive yourself like
you forgive your daddy and...

01:08:33.622 --> 01:08:34.658
Poof.

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:36.126
You're free.

01:08:37.028 --> 01:08:39.865
Stop fooling around up there
and watch.

01:08:43.201 --> 01:08:45.935
Tada! See you next year.

01:08:46.938 --> 01:08:48.506
Gotta let it go, son.

01:08:55.912 --> 01:08:57.113
Hey!

01:08:57.649 --> 01:08:58.884
Where are you going?

01:08:59.283 --> 01:09:00.317
Hey!

01:09:01.018 --> 01:09:02.386
What's your name?

01:09:15.667 --> 01:09:18.301
Oh, no.
You went to Red Lobster?

01:09:18.435 --> 01:09:20.403
- Yeah.
- We go there all the time.

01:09:20.938 --> 01:09:24.841
- They got cheddar biscuits.
- Should've gone to Red Robin.

01:09:24.975 --> 01:09:26.310
Bottomless fries.

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:29.011
I make an exception to
the carb rule for French fries.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:31.750
Right, because
I can't even eat Lobster.

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:33.917
I got that puff puff in my bag.

01:09:34.051 --> 01:09:36.987
- I'm so allergic...
- Beyoncé is not funny.

01:09:37.121 --> 01:09:38.788
My Grandma loves Beyoncé.

01:09:43.394 --> 01:09:45.429
Wanna know the real feminist?

01:09:45.563 --> 01:09:47.863
- Taylor swift.
- Josephine Baker.

01:09:47.997 --> 01:09:49.800
- Who's that?
- Google?

01:09:49.934 --> 01:09:51.533
I just sent you the repeat.

01:09:51.868 --> 01:09:53.103
Did you just text Al

01:09:53.238 --> 01:09:54.472
- that I'm not fun?
- No.

01:09:54.605 --> 01:09:56.974
First, I am fun.
Second, I'm very fun.

01:09:57.108 --> 01:09:59.176
Stop shooting
those stupid things.

01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:01.546
- Don't point that at me! No!
- Incoming!

01:10:06.184 --> 01:10:07.252
Ah!

01:10:07.385 --> 01:10:09.619
- Hello?
- Is somebody there?

01:10:10.186 --> 01:10:11.622
Go see who it is!

01:10:11.889 --> 01:10:13.324
- You go!
- It's probably Vern.

01:10:13.457 --> 01:10:14.991
- Estevez!
- Hey, Vern!

01:10:15.126 --> 01:10:16.027
- Vern?
- Hello?

01:10:16.159 --> 01:10:17.295
Kitty?

01:10:22.065 --> 01:10:24.568
- You're not Vern.
- No. Sorry.

01:10:24.702 --> 01:10:27.003
- Who are you?
- Are you spying on us?

01:10:27.137 --> 01:10:28.672
He looks like Ed Sheeran.

01:10:28.805 --> 01:10:32.143
- Why are you spying, Ed Sheeran?
- I'm not Ed Sheeran.

01:10:32.277 --> 01:10:33.877
- I'm Rudy.
- Why are you spying on us, Rudy?

01:10:34.011 --> 01:10:37.181
I was just walking by.
I heard your conversation.

01:10:37.414 --> 01:10:38.716
It was interesting.

01:10:39.684 --> 01:10:41.286
I'm sorry. I'll go.

01:10:41.586 --> 01:10:44.456
- Do you have any beer?
- At my house, and I have eggnog.

01:10:44.588 --> 01:10:46.957
Why are you wearing that outfit?
Is it a costume?

01:10:47.091 --> 01:10:48.559
The hat?

01:10:48.692 --> 01:10:50.527
- He always dresses like that.
- Do you know this guy?

01:10:50.661 --> 01:10:53.097
- No.
- Yes. I see him on the train.

01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:55.231
I think he's cute. Like an elf.

01:10:55.599 --> 01:10:57.668
Come inside. Would you like
something to drink?

01:10:57.801 --> 01:10:58.969
Do you have any cocoa?

01:11:01.972 --> 01:11:04.576
- Please?
- Okay, okay.

01:11:07.345 --> 01:11:08.880
So, what you say your name is?

01:11:09.012 --> 01:11:10.247
- Rudy.
- Sup, Rudy?

01:11:10.381 --> 01:11:11.615
You have eggnog.
That's for Christmas.

01:11:11.748 --> 01:11:13.717
- I like Christmas.
- "I like Christmas"!

01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:16.086
- Check this guy out!
- Don't pay any attention to him.

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:17.555
- I like Christmas too.
- You do?

01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:20.057
Who doesn't like Christmas?
I'm Molly.

01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:21.591
- This is Al.
- I'm Hall.

01:11:21.725 --> 01:11:24.929
That's Estevez.
And Nelson's making the cocoa.

01:11:25.261 --> 01:11:27.599
Rudy wants to say something.
Say it, Rudy.

01:11:27.731 --> 01:11:29.466
Those are the actors
in <i>The Breakfast Club.</i>

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.935
- We know.
- That's weird.

01:11:31.069 --> 01:11:32.470
Says the guy
dressed like an elf.

01:11:32.603 --> 01:11:34.105
No, I like it.
<i>The Breakfast Club</i> is good.

01:11:34.238 --> 01:11:35.705
It's not a Christmas movie,
but I like it.

01:11:35.838 --> 01:11:37.509
Are you guys just super
into the movie or something?

01:11:37.641 --> 01:11:39.844
It's a coincidence.
Those are our real names.

01:11:39.976 --> 01:11:41.679
- Okay.
- Are you judging?

01:11:41.811 --> 01:11:43.113
- No.
- Good.

01:11:43.247 --> 01:11:44.448
Because you see us
how you want to see us.

01:11:44.582 --> 01:11:46.017
In the most simplest terms.

01:11:46.150 --> 01:11:47.751
In the most
convenient definitions.

01:11:47.885 --> 01:11:51.389
But what we found out is that
each one of us is a brain,

01:11:51.523 --> 01:11:55.793
an athlete, a basket case,
a princess,

01:11:55.926 --> 01:11:57.695
and a criminal.

01:11:57.962 --> 01:12:01.031
- Does that answer your question?
- What question?

01:12:01.164 --> 01:12:02.399
Exactly.

01:12:02.533 --> 01:12:03.534
And why do you have eggnog
in February,

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:05.302
Mr. Ed Sheeran peeping Tom guy?

01:12:05.435 --> 01:12:07.203
- It was for my Christmas party.
- It's Valentine's.

01:12:07.337 --> 01:12:09.305
- You're having a party?
- Yeah but I left.

01:12:09.439 --> 01:12:10.540
Do you spy on people
all the time?

01:12:10.673 --> 01:12:12.710
- No!
- Dude left his own party.

01:12:12.842 --> 01:12:14.211
That's hardcore.

01:12:14.345 --> 01:12:15.679
Nobody came. One person came.
She's my friend.

01:12:15.813 --> 01:12:17.614
Was my friend, I guess.
I was mean to her.

01:12:17.748 --> 01:12:20.451
Nobody came to your party.

01:12:20.583 --> 01:12:22.819
Why were you mean to her?
What did you do?

01:12:22.953 --> 01:12:24.255
Did she look like an elf too?

01:12:24.387 --> 01:12:25.655
- You hit her, didn't you?
- You hit an elf?

01:12:25.789 --> 01:12:28.426
Now, violence,
statistically speaking...

01:12:28.559 --> 01:12:30.594
She doesn't look like an elf.
She looks like a cat.

01:12:30.728 --> 01:12:32.529
- You hit a cat?
- No, I didn't hit her.

01:12:32.662 --> 01:12:34.198
Did you poke her with
a really sharp candy cane?

01:12:34.332 --> 01:12:35.499
- That would hurt!
- No, I yelled at her.

01:12:35.632 --> 01:12:37.234
She brought me
Valentine's candy.

01:12:37.368 --> 01:12:39.337
Yelled at her for bringing
Valentine's Day candy?

01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:40.804
I don't blame you.

01:12:40.938 --> 01:12:42.605
That cheap stuff you get
at Fred Meyer is toxic.

01:12:42.739 --> 01:12:44.041
Have you guys been
to that place called

01:12:44.175 --> 01:12:45.376
the Meadow on Mississippi?

01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:46.811
So good.

01:12:46.944 --> 01:12:49.412
Even if it is Fred Meyer
chocolate, you say thank you.

01:12:49.546 --> 01:12:51.749
And you don't even eat it...
until you're alone.

01:12:51.882 --> 01:12:53.449
It was a Christmas party!

01:12:53.583 --> 01:12:56.820
- It's Valentine's.
- It was a Christmas party.

01:12:56.953 --> 01:12:58.822
Wow. Okay.

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:10.568
Hot chocolate.

01:13:10.835 --> 01:13:12.170
Al.

01:13:13.069 --> 01:13:14.271
Estevez.

01:13:15.104 --> 01:13:16.239
Rudy.

01:13:16.606 --> 01:13:17.641
Molly.

01:13:19.076 --> 01:13:21.878
To old friends, and new friends.

01:13:22.012 --> 01:13:23.314
Cheers!

01:13:23.447 --> 01:13:25.315
Merry Christmas!

01:13:25.448 --> 01:13:27.216
Obsessed much? Not healthy.

01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:28.351
That's what I hear.

01:13:28.985 --> 01:13:32.256
So, Rudy, was the girl
who brought chocolate

01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:33.691
and looks like a cat
your girlfriend?

01:13:33.823 --> 01:13:36.059
I don't know.
I never had a girlfriend before.

01:13:36.194 --> 01:13:37.395
Do you feel friendzoned?

01:13:37.528 --> 01:13:38.929
Story of my life.

01:13:39.061 --> 01:13:41.532
Rudy can turn it around,
if he wants to. Can't you, Rudy?

01:13:41.664 --> 01:13:43.900
My mom's therapist
would like that.

01:13:44.033 --> 01:13:46.737
- What would you like?
- I like this hot chocolate.

01:13:46.871 --> 01:13:49.907
At home, I put marshmallows
and rain sprinkles on top.

01:13:50.041 --> 01:13:51.409
That was deflection.

01:13:51.542 --> 01:13:53.377
I wish men would just be honest.

01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:55.880
Have you ever met an honest man?

01:13:56.014 --> 01:13:57.148
- Never.
- Hello?

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.615
You wish.

01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:01.952
What would you wish for, Rudy,
if you could wish for anything?

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.423
I wish it was Christmas
every day. For everyone.

01:14:05.556 --> 01:14:07.891
Do you ever talk
about anything else?

01:14:08.592 --> 01:14:10.728
What is it about
Christmas that you like?

01:14:10.862 --> 01:14:13.262
Everything!
Don't you like Christmas?

01:14:13.497 --> 01:14:14.832
It's one
of my favorite holidays.

01:14:14.966 --> 01:14:16.700
Christmas isn't a holiday.

01:14:16.934 --> 01:14:18.869
If it's not a holiday,
what is it?

01:14:19.002 --> 01:14:21.404
Christmas is a feeling.

01:14:21.872 --> 01:14:23.539
A perfect...

01:14:23.673 --> 01:14:24.442
feeling.

01:14:24.574 --> 01:14:25.742
Christmas is life.

01:14:25.876 --> 01:14:28.346
Christmas is the opposite
of gray.

01:14:28.712 --> 01:14:30.046
Gray days.

01:14:30.881 --> 01:14:33.818
Everybody is at their best
at Christmas.

01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:35.853
Everybody is kind.

01:14:36.153 --> 01:14:37.621
Everybody's forgiving.

01:14:38.154 --> 01:14:39.623
Everybody's honest.

01:14:39.756 --> 01:14:43.260
Why can't you be kind,
forgiving and honest all year?

01:14:43.394 --> 01:14:46.664
Are you kind,
forgiving, and honest?

01:14:47.064 --> 01:14:48.099
Yes.

01:14:48.765 --> 01:14:50.933
Was it kind to yell at Clarice?

01:14:51.068 --> 01:14:52.537
No.

01:14:54.037 --> 01:14:57.006
Is it forgiving to expect your
mother to be someone she isn't?

01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:58.641
No.

01:14:58.775 --> 01:15:00.777
Is it honest to keep things
that don't belong to you?

01:15:00.911 --> 01:15:02.046
No.

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:04.548
No wonder
everyone disappoints you.

01:15:04.881 --> 01:15:07.417
You can't even live up
to your own ideals.

01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:10.421
Nobody's perfect.
People aren't perfect.

01:15:10.554 --> 01:15:12.957
So shines a light
on a weary world.

01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:15.525
Actually,
if you're going Willy Wonka,

01:15:15.658 --> 01:15:19.429
- it's "So shines a good deed"...
- Do you mind?

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.369
It seems to me that
all you're really trying to do

01:15:25.502 --> 01:15:26.804
having Christmas every day,

01:15:26.936 --> 01:15:29.407
is to hold up
in your little gingerbread house

01:15:29.539 --> 01:15:32.376
and recapture that
one special moment in your life.

01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:34.278
When you thought
the world was right.

01:15:34.412 --> 01:15:35.813
The world was right.

01:15:35.945 --> 01:15:37.680
You always knew
your dad wasn't coming back.

01:15:37.814 --> 01:15:40.218
You don't have to worry
about people being mean to you.

01:15:40.685 --> 01:15:43.121
Abandoning you
like you're nothing.

01:15:43.488 --> 01:15:45.389
Is that
how you see yourself?

01:15:45.523 --> 01:15:47.891
That's how everybody sees me.

01:15:48.158 --> 01:15:49.360
Not Clarice.

01:15:49.493 --> 01:15:51.661
She's nice right now
but in the end,

01:15:51.795 --> 01:15:53.364
she'll just make fun of me.

01:15:53.497 --> 01:15:56.934
Because you pretend
it's Christmas Day, every day?

01:15:57.067 --> 01:15:58.636
I do not pretend.

01:15:58.769 --> 01:16:02.105
- Because Christmas is not a day.
- Boy, you're too frustrating.

01:16:02.238 --> 01:16:03.607
You're giving me sciatica.

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:05.576
Somebody like you
could never understand

01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:07.711
what it's like to be
somebody like me.

01:16:07.845 --> 01:16:11.014
The drama queen
award goes to...

01:16:11.148 --> 01:16:12.417
you!

01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:14.719
I feel funny.

01:16:15.819 --> 01:16:18.387
Did you put something
in my cocoa?

01:16:18.521 --> 01:16:20.457
Yes.

01:16:20.591 --> 01:16:23.995
- What?
- Just a little Christmas magic.

01:16:24.627 --> 01:16:26.831
Simmer down.

01:16:32.536 --> 01:16:34.072
Who's there?

01:16:35.238 --> 01:16:36.639
This looks familiar.

01:16:36.774 --> 01:16:38.109
- How did we...
- Where are we?

01:16:38.242 --> 01:16:40.077
I don't know. We should go.

01:16:40.211 --> 01:16:41.779
Go where? We're already here.

01:16:41.912 --> 01:16:44.248
Boy, would you look around and
tell me where you think you are?

01:16:44.381 --> 01:16:46.550
I went through a lot of trouble
to make this happen.

01:16:46.684 --> 01:16:48.386
This is the house I lived in!

01:16:48.752 --> 01:16:51.788
When I was a kid.
I still have that tree.

01:16:52.222 --> 01:16:54.225
Look how perfect everything is.

01:16:54.591 --> 01:16:56.692
- Christmas!
- Who's that?

01:16:56.827 --> 01:16:59.597
Lord, for somebody as obsessed
with Christmas

01:16:59.729 --> 01:17:02.932
and you are obsessed,
you are thicker than Ashanti.

01:17:03.067 --> 01:17:04.402
And that girl is thick.

01:17:04.635 --> 01:17:07.404
Right round here.
Right on that middle section.

01:17:07.537 --> 01:17:10.339
I don't know how much money
she spends on clothes but...

01:17:10.673 --> 01:17:12.975
I mean, she does look good.
She must have a...

01:17:13.377 --> 01:17:16.713
- deal with the devil.
- We are gonna get arrested.

01:17:16.846 --> 01:17:19.015
Luckily for one of us,
that's not true.

01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:20.917
- Rudy?
- Yes, Mom?

01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:22.653
Oh,
now you're getting it.

01:17:22.786 --> 01:17:25.088
Really because I don't feel
like I'm getting it.

01:17:25.221 --> 01:17:26.789
Oh, for goodness sake.
Get dressed.

01:17:26.923 --> 01:17:28.859
- Where's Daddy?
- He left.

01:17:28.993 --> 01:17:30.361
Why?

01:17:30.493 --> 01:17:33.195
Don't worry. He'll be back.
He can't get along without me.

01:17:33.329 --> 01:17:34.765
We just have to show him

01:17:34.899 --> 01:17:36.634
how much better it is
when everything is perfect.

01:17:36.766 --> 01:17:38.536
Then he'll want to come back
and be perfect too.

01:17:38.668 --> 01:17:40.704
Doesn't he love us anymore?

01:17:41.104 --> 01:17:42.305
Mom.

01:17:42.439 --> 01:17:44.442
We're not here.
She can't hear you.

01:17:44.574 --> 01:17:46.076
I thought you said
you were getting this.

01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:47.510
I didn't say that.

01:17:47.644 --> 01:17:49.012
I have to give Daddy
my Christmas present.

01:17:49.145 --> 01:17:51.614
- It's socks.
- He doesn't want presents.

01:17:51.747 --> 01:17:53.549
- Yes he does.
- Not today!

01:17:53.684 --> 01:17:55.052
Can I give it to him tomorrow?

01:17:55.185 --> 01:17:57.987
I don't know. Look at me, Rudy.
Remember this.

01:17:58.122 --> 01:18:00.391
Less than perfect is never
good enough.

01:18:00.524 --> 01:18:02.326
Promise me you'll remember that.

01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:03.860
Okay. Mom?

01:18:04.161 --> 01:18:06.462
Oh, for goodness sake,
get dressed.

01:18:06.595 --> 01:18:07.864
What is perfect?

01:18:08.298 --> 01:18:11.268
When something is
the very best it can be.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.568
Including people.

01:18:12.703 --> 01:18:13.737
Is Christmas
perfect?

01:18:13.869 --> 01:18:15.471
Not this Christmas.

01:18:15.605 --> 01:18:17.273
Then we can do it
better tomorrow.

01:18:17.407 --> 01:18:19.409
I promise. I'll try really hard.

01:18:19.543 --> 01:18:21.545
Tomorrow is not Christmas.

01:18:21.679 --> 01:18:23.948
I bet it can be
if you wish hard enough.

01:18:24.614 --> 01:18:25.782
What are you doing?

01:18:26.048 --> 01:18:28.551
Wishing it was Christmas
every day!

01:18:28.685 --> 01:18:30.520
Go get dressed!

01:18:30.654 --> 01:18:32.289
- Mom?
- Yes?

01:18:32.422 --> 01:18:33.858
Am I perfect?

01:18:34.358 --> 01:18:36.627
No. Not when you're
still in your pajamas

01:18:36.761 --> 01:18:38.595
after I've told you twice
to get dressed.

01:18:38.729 --> 01:18:41.999
You are most definitely
not perfect.

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:44.335
That...

01:18:44.801 --> 01:18:46.702
was a moment.

01:18:47.069 --> 01:18:48.005
Yeah.

01:18:51.408 --> 01:18:54.244
It's so disorienting the way
we just pop from place to place.

01:18:54.377 --> 01:18:57.247
- Why isn't he in a car seat?
- Hush, I'm trying to hear

01:18:57.381 --> 01:18:59.750
what your mom and that man
are fighting about.

01:18:59.884 --> 01:19:02.653
This is like
a Hallmark movie.

01:19:02.786 --> 01:19:04.354
But with black people.

01:19:04.787 --> 01:19:06.489
Me, Rudolph.
I'm talking about me.

01:19:06.622 --> 01:19:08.125
Hey, there's my snow globe.

01:19:08.257 --> 01:19:10.594
- I loved that thing.
- Would you hush?

01:19:10.728 --> 01:19:12.430
I wish it would be Christmas
every day

01:19:12.563 --> 01:19:13.730
till Daddy comes home.

01:19:13.997 --> 01:19:16.500
Then everything
will be perfect again.

01:19:18.668 --> 01:19:21.604
Is that not the saddest
little thing you've ever heard?

01:19:21.738 --> 01:19:23.306
I tried
to make it perfect.

01:19:23.439 --> 01:19:26.009
I want to give
Daddy his Christmas present.

01:19:26.143 --> 01:19:28.078
Your daddy said
to tell you you're very spoiled,

01:19:28.212 --> 01:19:29.947
and that you have too many toys,
and that there are

01:19:30.079 --> 01:19:32.015
a lot of boys and girls
who don't have any toys at all,

01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:34.218
and that he'll come back just
as soon as you're a good boy

01:19:34.351 --> 01:19:36.720
and learn
what Christmas is really about.

01:19:36.987 --> 01:19:39.355
What is Christmas
really about?

01:19:39.489 --> 01:19:40.523
Ask your father.

01:19:40.657 --> 01:19:44.194
That's cold.

01:19:44.328 --> 01:19:45.296
When he comes home?

01:19:45.429 --> 01:19:46.363
Oh, yes.

01:19:46.497 --> 01:19:48.298
He was never coming home.

01:19:49.632 --> 01:19:52.036
Sounds like a loop. Moving on.

01:19:56.774 --> 01:19:58.309
Hello?

01:19:58.975 --> 01:20:00.877
Hello, Miss Rotnase.

01:20:01.412 --> 01:20:03.213
Rudy isn't here right now.

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:05.148
I'm not sure.

01:20:05.515 --> 01:20:07.184
He went out. Uhm.

01:20:08.085 --> 01:20:09.987
- I can have him call you.
- Would you?

01:20:10.121 --> 01:20:11.454
Thank you, dear.

01:20:11.854 --> 01:20:13.323
Oh, Clarice,

01:20:13.457 --> 01:20:15.226
you two don't have plans
for tomorrow night, do you?

01:20:15.826 --> 01:20:17.828
Oh, good. I didn't think so.

01:20:18.395 --> 01:20:20.362
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't bring it up.

01:20:20.497 --> 01:20:23.500
I'm sure you'll find something
to do. You have friends.

01:20:23.966 --> 01:20:26.702
Rudy and I have a standing date
for Valentine's Day.

01:20:26.837 --> 01:20:28.539
<i>He looks so forward to it.</i>

01:20:31.608 --> 01:20:33.110
Isn't that sweet?

01:20:33.243 --> 01:20:35.112
You'd rather be with mom
on Valentine's Day

01:20:35.244 --> 01:20:37.380
than that nice,
white girl with the cat ears.

01:20:37.514 --> 01:20:40.217
- Mom kinda expects it.
- I bet you're gonna try

01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:42.686
to regift that box of chocolates
Clarice brought you.

01:20:42.819 --> 01:20:44.822
Rude. Give me that box.

01:20:49.059 --> 01:20:49.760
Mmm.

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:52.730
Mmm, these are not
from Fred Meyer.

01:20:52.863 --> 01:20:54.164
- These are good.
- You can eat that?

01:20:54.297 --> 01:20:56.233
I thought
we weren't really here.

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.735
I make exceptions for chocolate.

01:21:01.005 --> 01:21:04.240
Not till you apologize to
Clarice, Mr. Christmas every day

01:21:04.375 --> 01:21:06.210
'cause it's all about
love and forgiveness.

01:21:06.577 --> 01:21:09.747
Fool wouldn't know love
if it bit him the back pocket.

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:12.215
That's where you put
Clarice's Valentine card.

01:21:12.349 --> 01:21:13.317
Read it.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:19.023
That's not a real
Christmas card.

01:21:20.856 --> 01:21:22.225
That's annoying.

01:21:22.359 --> 01:21:24.160
You know what angels do
when things are annoying?

01:21:24.627 --> 01:21:26.063
- Snap out of it!
- Ow!

01:21:26.195 --> 01:21:29.131
- All glory to Cher.
- Ow!

01:21:29.265 --> 01:21:31.533
Everybody gets one wish
in this life.

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:33.502
Don't screw it up.

01:21:33.636 --> 01:21:35.104
I already did.

01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:36.672
Then, fix it!

01:21:36.806 --> 01:21:38.841
Boy, you're not 20.

01:21:39.076 --> 01:21:40.543
You're not even 30.

01:21:40.677 --> 01:21:42.778
In fact, 40 might be generous.

01:21:42.912 --> 01:21:44.780
You ever heard of moisturizer?

01:21:45.114 --> 01:21:46.783
That's your answer right there.

01:21:46.917 --> 01:21:49.186
You gotta keep things soft,
and supple, and smooth,

01:21:49.319 --> 01:21:51.621
and nice to the touching.
Damn, I look good!

01:21:52.255 --> 01:21:55.826
- You know how old I am?
- Are we still talking about me?

01:21:56.527 --> 01:21:57.795
Figure it out, Rudy.

01:21:57.927 --> 01:21:59.429
Before it's too late.

01:21:59.563 --> 01:22:02.465
And that nasty little dog
of yours eats your face off.

01:22:02.599 --> 01:22:03.868
Prancer?

01:22:04.001 --> 01:22:05.836
It's Valentine's Day!

01:22:05.969 --> 01:22:07.436
I don't wanna be your Valentine.

01:22:07.569 --> 01:22:08.605
I'm the crazy one.

01:22:10.006 --> 01:22:11.375
Are you okay?

01:22:11.609 --> 01:22:13.143
Yeah. Hi.

01:22:13.277 --> 01:22:15.011
- Who are you?
- What are you doing?

01:22:15.145 --> 01:22:16.646
- Does somebody know this guy?
- Hold on.

01:22:16.779 --> 01:22:18.347
He may have a concussion.

01:22:18.614 --> 01:22:20.650
Can you get on your feet, buddy?

01:22:20.783 --> 01:22:22.585
Would you like
something to drink?

01:22:22.851 --> 01:22:24.654
- How about some cocoa?
- No.

01:22:24.787 --> 01:22:27.623
- No cocoa.
- We got a fire over here.

01:22:27.757 --> 01:22:29.158
Come hang out. Get warm.

01:22:29.292 --> 01:22:31.862
- We're all out of beer, though.
- I have beer.

01:22:32.328 --> 01:22:33.430
At my house.

01:22:34.564 --> 01:22:36.133
And I have eggnog.

01:22:37.068 --> 01:22:40.637
What's wrong with me?
I have eggnog,

01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:43.007
and it's not even Christmas.

01:22:43.773 --> 01:22:45.009
And...

01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:48.412
I have a girlfriend.

01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:52.849
She loves me.

01:22:55.551 --> 01:22:56.953
I gotta go.

01:22:59.021 --> 01:23:01.992
You guys want to come
to a party at my house?

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:06.096
I'm in love!

01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:10.500
Do you have egg-free
eggnog? I'm ovo-adverse.

01:23:25.649 --> 01:23:28.152
There you are!

01:23:29.118 --> 01:23:31.621
I love the eggnog. Love it!

01:23:31.755 --> 01:23:32.889
I'm a little tipsy.

01:23:33.122 --> 01:23:35.158
Wow. I knew you were talented

01:23:35.292 --> 01:23:36.860
but I didn't realize
you were this talented.

01:23:36.993 --> 01:23:38.562
This place is amazing.

01:23:38.962 --> 01:23:40.863
You do all this
on a dishwasher salary?

01:23:41.564 --> 01:23:44.534
- I'm paying you too much!
- Craigslist, free section.

01:23:44.667 --> 01:23:46.001
I'm gonna have to fire you.

01:23:46.136 --> 01:23:47.871
Get in the pants you need.

01:23:48.137 --> 01:23:50.573
You've got professional
grade style, soldier.

01:23:50.707 --> 01:23:52.409
- Own it!
- Owned.

01:24:10.426 --> 01:24:11.828
I'm sorry.

01:24:12.395 --> 01:24:13.362
No, I'm sorry.

01:24:13.630 --> 01:24:15.532
I was rude.

01:24:15.664 --> 01:24:17.167
Do you forgive me?

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:18.967
I shouldn't have tried
to make you do Valentine's Day.

01:24:19.101 --> 01:24:21.037
Yes, you should. It's...

01:24:21.337 --> 01:24:23.939
Happy Valentine's Day, Clarice.

01:24:24.073 --> 01:24:25.942
Chocolate?

01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:28.712
Somebody already had one.

01:24:28.845 --> 01:24:31.146
Clarice, this is Nelson.
He's my friend.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.815
- Nelson, this is...
- Janet.

01:24:32.949 --> 01:24:35.485
- It's Clarice.
- <i>Enchanté.</i>

01:24:36.886 --> 01:24:38.255
How nice.

01:24:39.023 --> 01:24:41.559
What charming underclothes
you both have on.

01:24:45.395 --> 01:24:46.396
Mom!

01:24:47.029 --> 01:24:49.032
You have people. I wasn't exp...

01:24:49.164 --> 01:24:52.269
- Oh, hello Clarice.
- Hello, Mrs. Rotnase.

01:24:52.402 --> 01:24:53.502
Merry Christmas!

01:24:54.270 --> 01:24:56.472
Mom, come meet all my friends.

01:24:56.606 --> 01:24:58.108
Oh, no, no. I can't stay.

01:24:58.242 --> 01:24:59.309
You don't want me here.

01:24:59.443 --> 01:25:01.211
Of course I do. You're my mom.

01:25:01.345 --> 01:25:03.579
- I love you.
- I love you too, dear.

01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:06.682
I'm sorry. I have been terrible.

01:25:06.817 --> 01:25:07.885
No. Don't say that.

01:25:08.118 --> 01:25:09.252
You weren't.

01:25:09.386 --> 01:25:10.954
I used to think that
about myself

01:25:11.087 --> 01:25:13.157
for a long time
and it's not true.

01:25:13.524 --> 01:25:14.423
I'm all right.

01:25:14.791 --> 01:25:16.092
We're all right.

01:25:16.458 --> 01:25:17.493
Not...

01:25:17.895 --> 01:25:19.162
- perfect.
- Far from perfect.

01:25:19.296 --> 01:25:21.731
Your father would be
very proud of you.

01:25:22.332 --> 01:25:24.934
Listen, I just stopped by
to talk to Clarice.

01:25:25.068 --> 01:25:26.170
You know, woman to cat.

01:25:26.302 --> 01:25:27.970
Hi, kitten!

01:25:28.404 --> 01:25:30.340
You wanted to talk to me,
Miss Rotnase?

01:25:30.474 --> 01:25:31.574
Call me Donna.

01:25:32.141 --> 01:25:34.610
After we spoke, I realized...

01:25:34.845 --> 01:25:36.313
I was being selfish.

01:25:36.546 --> 01:25:39.583
A boy doesn't wanna be with
his mother on Valentine's Day.

01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:42.719
Valentine's is something
his father and I would...

01:25:43.185 --> 01:25:44.921

with a Christmas in July party.

01:28:21.810 --> 01:28:24.012
It's kind of a misfit holiday
for the summer.

01:28:24.146 --> 01:28:25.148
Wouldn't you agree?

01:28:25.614 --> 01:28:27.817
Why are you doing this
for the residents, Rudy?

01:28:27.949 --> 01:28:29.618
