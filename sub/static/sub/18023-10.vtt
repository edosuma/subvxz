WEBVTT

00:09.342 --> 00:11.678
- Ah, this is lame.

00:11.678 --> 00:12.971
- What're you talkin' 'bout?

00:12.971 --> 00:15.348
- We hadn't seen a
duck in like, two hours.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.267
- You know what that means?

00:17.267 --> 00:18.893
They're due.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.355
- Jep, did you get one
of them smart watches?

00:22.355 --> 00:23.273
- Yes.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.774
62 degrees today.

00:24.774 --> 00:27.402
- You can get all that same
information on your phone, Jep.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.403
- You can talk on this thing.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.238
You know, I'm just
like hey, whats up.

00:30.238 --> 00:33.032
- Just pick up your phone
and talk on the phone.

00:33.032 --> 00:33.992
- It's way easier.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.118
See I got it right
here on my wrist.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.703
- Your phone's sitting
right beside you.

00:36.703 --> 00:37.454
- I don't wanna
look at my phone.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.246
I wanna look at my watch.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.081
Lookit that's awesome.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.041
- My watch tells me how
many steps I've taken.

00:42.041 --> 00:45.086
- I'm surprised there's
not an alarm going off

00:45.086 --> 00:47.046
saying not enough...

00:47.046 --> 00:48.047
- Not enough?

00:48.047 --> 00:49.048
- Shoot.
- Not enough.

00:49.048 --> 00:52.552
- I walked a lotta
steps today, okay?

00:52.552 --> 00:54.262
And now I'm gonna reward myself

00:54.262 --> 00:57.307
with eating cornbread.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.725
Mom's cornbread.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.060
- Oh, I'll have some of that.

01:01.060 --> 01:02.896
- It is the best in the world.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.522
- Nope.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.107
- So whose is better?

01:06.107 --> 01:07.817
- Missy.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.364
- Yeah.

01:13.364 --> 01:14.324
- Did you just say Missy?

01:14.324 --> 01:15.116
- Yes.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.078
- Have
you lost your mind?

01:19.078 --> 01:20.872
- Look, it's pretty
much impossible

01:20.872 --> 01:24.209
to make better
cornbread than my mom.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.376
But I'm here to tell ya

01:25.376 --> 01:28.254
that the impossible
has happened.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.590
Mom's was the best,

01:30.590 --> 01:32.675
and now Missy has ascended

01:32.675 --> 01:35.386
to the Queen of cornbread.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.556
- I don't even know
what's happened to you.

01:38.556 --> 01:39.516
- Sorry mom.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.601
You're still the
Queen of meatloaf.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.728
Nobody's arguing that.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.563
Once you eat Missy's cornbread

01:45.563 --> 01:47.524
there's no goin' back.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.235
- You can keep
living in the matrix

01:50.235 --> 01:51.861
as long as you want too, son.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.239
This is the best cornbread.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.240
- Jessica's ain't bad.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.908
It's got flax seed,
something weird in it.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.076
- Shh, shh, shh.
- But it's pretty good.

01:58.076 --> 01:58.868
- Flax seed?

01:58.868 --> 02:00.203
Does it have cheese and bacon?

02:00.203 --> 02:01.412
- No.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.081
- Well then it tastes like crap.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.250
- You're eatin' like...
- - It's a healthy choice.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.628
- If you're trying to be
healthy you don't eat cornbread.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.129
- Are y'all gonna hunt?

02:10.129 --> 02:11.673
- No cheese no bacon?

02:11.673 --> 02:12.423
- No.

02:12.423 --> 02:13.383
- Y'all are ridiculous.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.802
- It's a little plain,
on the plain side.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.264
- That makes me wanna
vomit just thinkin' about it.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.987
- So mom, you want
all this stuff to go?

02:33.987 --> 02:34.612
- Yeah.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.281
I've got tons more, too.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.323
- Oh no doubt.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.658
- Lord knows...
- - That's only the tip

02:38.658 --> 02:39.659
of the iceberg.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.077
- Lord knows you could
get rid of some stuff.

02:41.077 --> 02:42.745
Oh here we go.

02:42.745 --> 02:43.913
- Oh well look what
the cat drug up.

02:43.913 --> 02:44.873
- We got 'em.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.416
- Why we doin' laundry
on the counter?

02:46.416 --> 02:47.792
- We're goin' through clothes.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.043
- Kay, is this yours?

02:49.043 --> 02:49.878
- Yeah.

02:49.878 --> 02:50.795
- Willie's likin' it.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.213
- Gonna keep that
for lounge wear.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.548
When are the pies
gonna be ready?

02:53.548 --> 02:56.217
- Willie just ate about
eight pounds of cornbread.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.927
So I don't know why
he's hungry for pie.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.512
- Kay, he said awhile ago

02:59.512 --> 03:01.848
that Missy's cornbread's
better than yours.

03:07.812 --> 03:08.855
- That's funny.

03:08.855 --> 03:12.025
- Look, I trust Jase's
opinion on a few things,

03:12.025 --> 03:14.235
but food is not one of them.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.195
- It's the greatest
cornbread ever.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.530
- Jase's so skinny
he doesn't know

03:17.530 --> 03:19.407
what good food is anymore.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.408
I mean, just lookit this guy.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.327
He weighs like a
buck fifty at most.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.704
- You cook everything
else better,

03:24.704 --> 03:26.247
- Thank you.
- but just this one issue.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.707
- You've gotta few one issues.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.920
- I'm not sure what Missy's

03:31.920 --> 03:34.172
so called famous ingredient
is in her cornbread,

03:34.172 --> 03:37.383
but by looking at Jase I
can tell you with confidence

03:37.383 --> 03:39.510
that it doesn't
have enough butter.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.763
Therefore it's not
good cornbread.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.640
Enough said.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.849
Jase, you've lost your mind.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.100
- Let's put it to the test.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.227
- I'll put Lisa's cornbread
up against anybody's.

03:48.227 --> 03:50.063
- Why don't y'all just
bring 'em all together

03:50.063 --> 03:51.814
and have a cornbread contest.

03:51.814 --> 03:52.523
- When we doin it?

03:52.523 --> 03:53.358
Tomorrow?

03:53.358 --> 03:54.442
- Let's do it.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.693
- I better call Missy.

03:55.693 --> 03:58.112
- Y'all should try
Jessica's flax seed cornbread.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.573
- Jep, Jessica's
cornbread is terrible.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.075
- It's decent.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.209
- Where is Si, man?

04:11.209 --> 04:12.543
Taking forever.

04:12.543 --> 04:13.962
- Probably in the bathroom.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.463
- Or asleep somewhere.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.507
- Lazier than normal.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.216
Si?

04:18.216 --> 04:18.758
Come on.

04:18.758 --> 04:19.592
- Hey.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.885
- What's takin' you
so long dude?

04:20.885 --> 04:22.011
- Look at my age

04:24.138 --> 04:25.264
you don't do nothin' fast.

04:25.264 --> 04:27.684
- Are you gonna have
another heart attack?

04:27.684 --> 04:28.601
- Well I hope not.

04:28.601 --> 04:29.852
I done had one.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.688
- You're movin' really slow.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.732
You should take supplements.

04:34.732 --> 04:35.858
- You talkin' about steroids?

04:35.858 --> 04:37.026
- No.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.486
- You know what's better
than supplements?

04:38.486 --> 04:39.404
- What?

04:39.404 --> 04:41.239
- Deer antler makes
you feel better.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.282
Vijay Singh, golfer, used it.

04:43.282 --> 04:45.118
Won on the PGA tour at 52.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.244
- Y'all making this up.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.162
- No, I ain't kidding.
- It's a real thing.

04:48.162 --> 04:49.372
- A stupid deer antler?

04:49.372 --> 04:50.957
- Yeah.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.459
- People are always
tryin' to scam me

04:53.459 --> 04:58.506
with these mountain of
youth miracle cures.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.009
I fell off a dump truck,
but it wasn't last night.

05:01.843 --> 05:02.677
- What?

05:02.677 --> 05:04.220
- It's all natural HGH.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.513
Well, that's what I recommend.

05:05.513 --> 05:06.305
- What's HGH?

05:06.305 --> 05:08.224
- Human growth hormone.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.684
- I think it's just GH though,

05:09.684 --> 05:11.519
cause deer wouldn't have H.

05:11.519 --> 05:12.103
- Yeah.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.062
DGH.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.355
- What are you
talkin' about?

05:14.355 --> 05:16.315
But, hey, on the other hand,

05:16.315 --> 05:18.234
what's the worst
thing can happen?

05:18.234 --> 05:20.028
- I also hear it's
good for your libido.

05:20.028 --> 05:20.862
- Uh oh.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.700
- Look that ships
done sailed and sunk.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.078
Them days are over.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.456
It's not like I got
anything to lose.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.416
I've already lost it.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.876
- Si, you gotta try something.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.794
I mean you're doin' nothing.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.088
- Well hey look, I'll
try the deer antlers.

05:39.088 --> 05:39.547
- Will you?

05:39.547 --> 05:40.131
- Yeah.

05:40.131 --> 05:40.882
- That's awesome.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.216
- You got nothing to lose.

05:42.216 --> 05:43.051
- But right now I'm pooped,

05:43.051 --> 05:44.343
so I'm gonna go take a nap.

05:45.678 --> 05:46.721
- Alright.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.056
- I don't know if any of
this mess' gonna work.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.183
Trying to get more
energy outta Si may be

05:50.183 --> 05:53.519
like trying to get grape juice
out of a raisin, you know?

05:53.519 --> 05:54.228
- Yeah.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.772
Si is a little raisiny.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.524
- Yeah, he's
like a big prune.

06:08.242 --> 06:11.079
- Well this should
settle it once and for all.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.038
- Yeah we're
gonna settle it.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.206
I'm gonna win.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.373
- Three men enter,

06:14.373 --> 06:15.833
one man leaves.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.710
- We're all
leaving we're not...

06:17.710 --> 06:19.420
- I mean,
I'm just saying.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.755
- We should weed out

06:20.755 --> 06:22.465
who shouldn't be here for sure.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.884
- Winner winner
cornbread dinner.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.053
- Let's do this.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.305
- Look, in this family
we have a very simple way

06:29.305 --> 06:30.765
of solving disagreements.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.266
We compete.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.685
Over and over and over.

06:34.685 --> 06:35.561
Alright.

06:35.561 --> 06:36.562
So here's the deal.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.898
So we got the
cornbread in each cup.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.399
Names on the bottom.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.859
We're gonna do the taste test,

06:41.859 --> 06:43.402
we're gonna be blindfolded.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.196
Cornbread may seem
like a silly thing

06:45.196 --> 06:46.239
to fight over.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.865
But you know what ain't silly?

06:47.865 --> 06:49.367
Honor.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.785
Family.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.245
Respect.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.538
Warm butter.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.706
Golden crust.

06:55.706 --> 06:56.624
Cheese.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.544
God I'm gettin' hungry.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.170
Ya hear my stomach growl?

07:01.170 --> 07:02.588
Y'all ready to go dark?

07:02.588 --> 07:03.840
- Wait a minute now.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.717
I'm not sure I
understand the rules.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.636
What we need is an
impartial judge.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.012
- That's what
blindfolds are for.

07:10.012 --> 07:10.930
- That's right.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.056
- Because people
don't trust people.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.141
- That's all stupid.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.725
- Going dark boys.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.353
- For the record this is stupid.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.021
- Well for the
record you're stupid.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.231
- Agreed.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.691
- Okay, ready?
- Let's start this.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.401
- Alright first piece in.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.111
- Contestant number one.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.364
- Mm.

07:31.033 --> 07:37.039
- Mm.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.583
- Here's what I look
for in good cornbread.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.918
I need fluffy corn mix,

07:40.918 --> 07:42.420
whatever's in there,

07:42.420 --> 07:45.006
with the saltiness of the bacon,

07:45.006 --> 07:47.425
with just a hint,

07:47.425 --> 07:50.595
slight kiss of jalapeno,

07:50.595 --> 07:52.096
that's super moist,

07:52.096 --> 07:55.349
but that also has a
crunch on the outside.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.144
- That was good.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.021
- That's out.

08:00.021 --> 08:00.938
- Number two.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.194
- Mm.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.028
- Meaty.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.281
- The key to cornbread

08:10.281 --> 08:12.867
is to have the crunch
in the right places.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.285
Number three.

08:17.705 --> 08:18.706
Oh wow.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.667
And finally you have
to have some heat.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.544
- Oh boy.

08:23.544 --> 08:24.629
- Woah.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.047
- This one's very hot.

08:26.047 --> 08:26.923
- Yeah. I like it.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.384
- Alright.

08:31.886 --> 08:32.720
- Done.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.429
- Ready?

08:33.429 --> 08:35.598
- It wasn't even close.

08:35.598 --> 08:36.891
- This is my winner right here.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.726
- Clearly this is the winner.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.311
- This is the winner.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.520
- Kay.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.271
- Missy.

08:42.271 --> 08:43.564
- Loser.
- Lisa.

08:43.564 --> 08:45.191
- Alright, well we've
solved nothing here.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.068
- I just thought
you'd be unbiased

08:47.068 --> 08:49.904
and pick the best one but no.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.406
- You look like a
cornbread gang member.

08:52.406 --> 08:53.950
- Alright I'm going
to the bathroom.

08:53.950 --> 08:58.913
- I recommend us getting way
away from wherever he's headed.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.998
- God, my
stomach's killin' me.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.422
- Well, y'all just
come on round here

09:08.422 --> 09:09.966
I'll show you what I got.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.387
- Oh Mountain Man you
always have no shortage

09:14.387 --> 09:15.554
of stuff, do you?

09:15.554 --> 09:16.722
- Hey look a yo-yo.

09:16.722 --> 09:17.640
- Lotta junk.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.225
- What we got Mountain Man?

09:19.225 --> 09:21.519
- I'll show you Si.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.020
I'm gonna fix you right up.

09:23.020 --> 09:26.232
You're gonna be Hercules
before you know it.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.192
- You know that phrase
pert as a ruttin' buck?

09:28.192 --> 09:29.568
You'll be just like that.

09:29.568 --> 09:32.572
- You'll be doin' things you
never thought you could do.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.198
- We gonna find out.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.242
Look they say deer antlers

09:36.242 --> 09:38.244
give you strength and endurance.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.037
- Here comes the gold mine, boy.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.122
- That's it.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.206
I told you.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.041
- Gold right there, pa.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.793
- I'm not as young
as I used to be.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.086
Yup, mm-hmm.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.629
I'm not a young
whippersnapper anymore.

09:48.629 --> 09:49.380
Alright mountain dog,

09:49.380 --> 09:50.756
you got a saw around here?

09:50.756 --> 09:52.091
- There you go.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.551
Get after it Hercules.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.219
- Alright boy.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.345
Hey look,

09:56.345 --> 09:58.597
if there's anything to
this deer antler stuff,

09:58.597 --> 10:01.976
okay, hey, I'll be
pumped up in no time.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.109
- His knee is directly
under that saw blade.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.195
I just hope it don't slip.

10:14.238 --> 10:15.239
- Look, I'm not a doctor,

10:15.239 --> 10:16.532
but I'm pretty sure deer antlers

10:16.532 --> 10:18.409
are not gonna help
Si's condition.

10:18.409 --> 10:21.203
- Oh this ain't got no
teeth on it Mountain Man.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.039
- Hey.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.751
- And by condition I mean
stubborn, old, and lazy.

10:27.960 --> 10:28.627
- Total.

10:28.627 --> 10:29.795
- I think I gotta plan.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.173
What we do is we get Si

10:32.173 --> 10:34.759
to think he's the
strongest man in the world

10:34.759 --> 10:36.594
because he's taken
this deer antler.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.845
- Strong like bull.

10:37.845 --> 10:38.763
- Yes.

10:38.763 --> 10:39.889
- But in this case
strong like deer.

10:39.889 --> 10:40.765
- Yeah.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.350
Strong like deer.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.768
I don't know if
chewing on deer antler

10:43.768 --> 10:45.561
is gonna turn Si into The Hulk.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.563
- He'll be posin' in
front of a mirror.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.357
He'll be walkin'
around there saying

10:49.357 --> 10:51.692
Christine feel that.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.904
- But I know it's gonna be
really fun for the rest of us.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.864
- Si, by the time you
get done with this stuff

10:56.864 --> 10:58.699
you'll be able to pick
that up and break it.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.534
- Deer antlers.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.494
Super charge.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.120
- Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.247
- Alright, I think I
got all of these boys.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.624
- You gonna pay the man?

11:07.917 --> 11:10.252
- Appreciate it Mountain Man.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.212
- That's it?

11:11.212 --> 11:12.755
- There ain't no
money in this hand.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.256
Wait a minute here.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.092
- Hey, I gotta test
the product huh?

11:16.092 --> 11:18.844
This is got a 30 day guaranteed.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.388
- Or your money back.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.722
- Or your money back.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.682
- Well I think you
have to give the money

11:23.682 --> 11:25.059
before you can get it back.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.102
- No.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.107
Deer antlers.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.025
Super charged.

11:33.025 --> 11:33.859
- Hurry up.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.069
- Alright these two boxes

11:35.069 --> 11:37.530
I've already replaced
with newspaper.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.115
Making these like,
the light ones.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.742
So make sure he's gotta
get one of these three.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.202
- This sounds like fun.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.371
- I'm not really concerned

11:45.371 --> 11:47.289
about pulling this
prank off on Si.

11:47.289 --> 11:50.459
One time we had him convinced
Middle Earth was a real place.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.586
He's been chewing on
deer antler all day.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.630
Dude, he's gonna
think he's so strong.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.258
Then he tried to
book a flight there,

11:57.258 --> 11:58.717
and figured out it didn't exist.

11:58.717 --> 12:01.053
So earlier these boxes
weight like 30 pounds.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.263
Now they weigh like five.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.389
- Hurry up.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.349
- And now that we've
tampered with the heavy boxes

12:05.349 --> 12:07.143
and made them each
about 30 pounds lighter,

12:07.143 --> 12:08.853
he's gonna think he
turned into The Hulk

12:08.853 --> 12:10.521
as soon as he picks one up.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.022
- Here he comes, here he
comes, here he comes.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.860
- Hey, you guys are
not gonna believe this.

12:15.860 --> 12:16.527
- What?

12:16.527 --> 12:17.736
- Okay.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.864
Since I've been chewing
on this stupid deer antler

12:19.864 --> 12:23.033
for the past 24 hours I'm
telling you it's working.

12:23.033 --> 12:27.455
I woke up this morning not
a pain or ache in my body.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.081
- Well that sure was fast.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.082
- What was fast was

12:30.082 --> 12:31.917
what happened in the
bathroom this morning.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.669
The only thing I can compare it

12:33.669 --> 12:38.007
to is like a log ride
at the amusement park.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.592
Shwoosh.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.218
- Well that's an
unexpected benefit.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.011
- Boys I'm telling you,

12:42.011 --> 12:44.263
I feel like I'm about 55 again.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.098
- How's your libido?

12:46.098 --> 12:47.349
- It's still like the Titanic.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.059
At the bottom of the ocean.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.770
- Before too long you might get
a little wind in your sails.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.564
- I doubt that.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.231
Load it up.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.983
- Si, dude you're strong.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.693
You can pick these up now.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.864
- Look, hey, I know what these
clowns have been up to.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.074
These idiots couldn't
pull off a good prank

13:04.074 --> 13:06.702
if their lives depended on it.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.537
I like where you're
headed there.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.039
Hand that thing over there.

13:10.039 --> 13:10.915
- Let me hold that for you.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.790
- Let's see.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.751
- Woah.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.669
- No problem.

13:15.669 --> 13:20.090
- Rule one, okay, look,
never plan the prank

13:20.090 --> 13:23.886
- We get Si to think he's the
strongest man in the world.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.096
when the person
you're trying to prank

13:26.096 --> 13:28.098
is sitting 10 feet
away from you.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.475
Put another one on there, Jep.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.559
- You want another one?

13:30.559 --> 13:31.560
- I think I can handle it, son.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.229
- I can't even carry two of 'em.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.064
- Si, you're strong like bull.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.942
- Alright, I'm telling you guys.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.318
- Go Si.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.570
- I'm gonna tell you what.

13:41.570 --> 13:42.613
- You're strong buddy.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.572
- Rule number two

13:43.572 --> 13:45.950
never try to pull
a prank on someone

13:45.950 --> 13:49.245
that has got a higher IQ

13:49.245 --> 13:52.456
or that is very
smarter than you are.

13:52.456 --> 13:55.084
Hey, I have found the
fountain of youth.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.627
- We tried tellin' ya.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.796
- Deer antlers it is.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.172
And rule number three

14:00.172 --> 14:01.549
if you mess with the deer

14:01.549 --> 14:03.968
you're gonna get the antler.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.344
Let me grab another box.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.137
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, no
don't get that one.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.057
- Oh good lord.
- You alright?

14:10.057 --> 14:11.892
- Hold on, let me move this.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.311
- You wanna call
an ambulance?

14:14.311 --> 14:15.604
- No hold up, hold up boys.

14:15.604 --> 14:16.564
Pick me up.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.565
- Pick you up?

14:17.565 --> 14:20.609
- Yeah you guys pick
me up I can't move.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.945
- Oh you're a lot
heavier than you look.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.407
- Ease straight back.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.409
- You alright?

14:28.409 --> 14:29.702
- No I'm not alright.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.580
I think that I actually pulled
or tweaked something guys.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.914
- It looked like it.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.332
- Hold on, you need some tea?

14:35.332 --> 14:36.417
That'll fix it.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.835
- Nah, that ain't gonna fix it.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.044
- I'll get you
some ibuprofen, Si.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.463
- I'm gonna get you a
bag of ice, alright?

14:41.463 --> 14:42.506
- Make it strong.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.465
- Golly.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.056
- You top that, gullible.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.104
- Thank y'all so much
for helping me with this.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.439
Baby Gus is gonna love it.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.315
- Of course.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.525
- I love the
colors, don't y'all?

15:01.525 --> 15:03.235
- I know, so cute.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.195
- I know what good cornbread is.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.697
- Can't handle the truth.

15:06.697 --> 15:07.615
- What?

15:07.615 --> 15:08.407
- Hey boys.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.575
- You're talking about warped.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.909
- What are you talking about?

15:10.909 --> 15:13.454
- Missy makes the
greatest cornbread

15:13.454 --> 15:14.371
- Oh my god.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.206
- That has
ever been made.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.709
And their mind won't
even entertain the idea

15:18.709 --> 15:20.544
- The greatest
cornbread ever made?

15:20.544 --> 15:21.920
- Ever.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.423
- That mean's you'd have to
have tasted every cornbread

15:24.423 --> 15:26.258
that has ever been
made for you to say...

15:26.258 --> 15:30.429
- Didn't y'all already have
that cornbread tasting contest?

15:30.429 --> 15:32.139
- It was inconclusive.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.099
We couldn't settle it.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.185
- Wait, that's why I
made the cornbread?

15:36.185 --> 15:37.311
- Yeah.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.312
- What?

15:39.563 --> 15:40.856
Don't get me wrong.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.025
I'm flattered that my husband
loves my conrbread so much.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.235
Why do you boys have to make
everything a competition?

15:45.235 --> 15:46.320
I don't understand.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.030
- Because that's how
you become the greatest.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.449
- It can't really determine
the greatest cornbread,

15:50.449 --> 15:52.242
because everyone likes
- Oh yeah you can.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.577
- different things.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.954
- But to start a
full on family war?

15:55.954 --> 15:57.998
It's a little extreme.

15:57.998 --> 16:01.543
- But too think a
cornbread is always dry.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.252
- That's right.
- Yeah.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.837
- So thinner, better.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.881
- I disagree with
the thin thing,

16:05.881 --> 16:09.259
but everybody makes their
own the way they like it.

16:09.259 --> 16:12.888
- I think it's okay to say this
is the best cornbread ever.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.807
- In your personal opinion.

16:16.183 --> 16:16.975
- No.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.435
- Yes.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.396
I don't want cornbread
to be the reason

16:20.396 --> 16:23.023
why we don't spend Christmas
together this year.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.442
- Look, you make your
cornbread again.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.736
We'll get an unbiased
judge to come in.

16:27.736 --> 16:28.821
And this'll be simple.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.156
Then it'll be we will
know whose the best is.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.366
- What if we don't want to?

16:32.366 --> 16:34.451
- I can see why
you don't want to.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.577
- Yeah, me too.

16:35.577 --> 16:36.495
- Oh please.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.873
- Yeah, see?

16:39.873 --> 16:41.709
This is how you
achieve greatness.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.544
- But who cares about
being the greatest?

16:43.544 --> 16:45.045
- I'll make my cornbread.

16:48.757 --> 16:51.218
Can't win unless
you're in the game.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.678
- I guess I'm in then.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.763
- Fine, count me in.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.891
- Ladies, you
better bring it.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.986
- We've got our
bowls of cornbread

17:08.986 --> 17:10.362
and we've got our
impartial judge.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.033
Okay ladies and gentlemen,

17:15.033 --> 17:16.076
boys and girls.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.745
- I think we're all adults here.

17:17.745 --> 17:21.081
- Welcome to the first
annual cornbread cook-off

17:21.081 --> 17:22.750
that should settle everything

17:22.750 --> 17:24.042
so it'll actually be the last.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.044
- Thank you, last, yes.

17:26.044 --> 17:27.755
- After all the
buildup and suspense

17:27.755 --> 17:29.715
the time has finally
come to find out

17:29.715 --> 17:31.925
who in the family makes
the best cornbread.

17:31.925 --> 17:33.051
Raise your right hand.

17:33.051 --> 17:35.846
Do you promise to
tell the truth?

17:37.222 --> 17:40.225
- I promise to tell the
truth my best ability

17:40.225 --> 17:43.061
and use my taste
buds accordingly

17:43.061 --> 17:45.564
to checkhis cornbread out

17:45.564 --> 17:47.399
and taste it right.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.693
- I now pronounce you
man and cornbread.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.237
You may eat the cornbread.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.363
- Now when you look
at Mountain Man

17:53.363 --> 17:55.783
you wouldn't think he has
a very refined palate.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.950
And he actually doesn't.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.410
He was just the only
guy we could find

17:58.410 --> 18:00.204
that had nothing to do.

18:00.204 --> 18:03.874
But no one I know has more
experience eating free food

18:03.874 --> 18:05.250
than Mountain Man.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.378
And in this case I think
experience does matter.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.965
- Okay. Here we go.
- Here we go.

18:11.965 --> 18:13.133
- Here we go--

18:13.133 --> 18:15.219
- Take it easy.
- cornbread.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.554
- Don't rush him.
- Here is the moment of truth.

18:17.554 --> 18:18.472
- Hmm.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.057
- That one got a hmm.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.600
Bowl number two.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.896
- Uh huh, uh huh.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.648
- That one kinda got a growl.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.066
- That one got an eye raise.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.068
- Yeah, that got a
growl and a eyebrow.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.238
- Last but not least,
bowl number three.

18:34.238 --> 18:38.075
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.493
- Hurry up, let's go.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.789
And the winner is.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.416
- Well, according
to my taste buds,

18:46.416 --> 18:49.795
to the best of my
taste bud knowledge...

18:51.713 --> 18:52.923
- I'm getting wrinkles.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.508
- Yeah, you gotta choose one.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.721
- It's a tie between bowl number
one and bowl number three.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.807
- There can't be a tie.
There's no ties.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.475
- He's the judge.
- Pick one.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.269
- He's the judge, he
said there's a tie.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.144
- He's not a judge.

19:06.144 --> 19:08.063
He's a air conditioner
repair guy.

19:08.063 --> 19:11.233
- This whole cornbread
debacle got way outta hand.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.736
Picking favorites in any family
is a recipe for disaster.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.154
- Unbiased opinion.

19:16.154 --> 19:17.739
- Mountain Man, do you
like the cornbread?

19:17.739 --> 19:19.533
- I like these two here.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.077
This one here ain't no good.

19:22.077 --> 19:23.912
You can use that on your trap.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.372
- So rather than letting
cornbread cause

19:25.372 --> 19:28.166
anymore problems, the
ladies and I decided to

19:28.166 --> 19:30.252
take matters into
our own hands.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.712
We have a confession to make.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.673
It's my cornbread.

19:35.924 --> 19:38.051
We all made my recipe.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.219
- You don't have a recipe.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.554
- Out of a box.

19:43.390 --> 19:44.600
- I saw it right off boys.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.767
That ain't cornbread.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.102
- He liked it.

19:47.102 --> 19:50.689
Ladies when you're married to
a man that wont let things go,

19:50.689 --> 19:53.901
sometimes you just have
to take it from him.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.360
- We gotta do the
whole thing again.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.570
- No.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.656
- The point is family is more
important than cornbread.

19:59.656 --> 20:00.574
- What?

20:00.574 --> 20:02.117
- Cornbread brings
families together,

20:02.117 --> 20:03.911
not tears them apart.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.621
- That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.748
- How come he didn't
like bowl number two?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.207
- We have no answer for that.

20:09.207 --> 20:10.375
It's the same.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.376
- I don't know.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.545
Bowl number two just
had a wang to it.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.714
- Oh, had a wang
to it boys.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.259
- Tastes like
crap, Mountain Man.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.260
Doesn't even taste good.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.553
- Oh it's delicious.

20:21.553 --> 20:24.514
I used my best
taste buds on this.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.058
Man.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.769
- Thank you father,

20:28.769 --> 20:31.438
for bringing our family
together on the Earth.

20:31.438 --> 20:35.859
Thank you for your love, your
kindness, and your patience.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.402
We need all those things.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.988
In the name of
Jesus I pray, amen.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.114
- Amen.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.741
- Pass the cornbread.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.952
- Competition
is a powerful thing.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.829
On one hand it inspires
growth and creativity,

20:47.829 --> 20:49.748
but on the other hand
it can inspire people

20:49.748 --> 20:51.541
to do some really stupid things.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.752
Sometimes it's
important to step back

20:53.752 --> 20:56.463
and remind yourself what
it is you're fighting for

20:56.463 --> 20:57.923
and at what cost.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.091
I think it's safe to say

20:59.091 --> 21:01.051
that if you've dragged
your entire family

21:01.051 --> 21:03.053
into a heated argument
over cornbread,

21:03.053 --> 21:05.305
then you've probably
gone too far.

21:05.305 --> 21:06.682
- Hey Si, any luck

21:06.682 --> 21:08.600
with the antlers
on the old libido?

21:08.600 --> 21:11.269
- Me and Christine was
about to set sail last night,

21:11.269 --> 21:13.563
but hey, I had to drop anchor.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.564
- I don't even want
to know what that means.
