01:27.634 --> 01:29.367
Not bad.

01:29.369 --> 01:31.503
You got to twist your hips,
like this.

01:35.709 --> 01:38.643
You got a little "Saturday Night
Fever" going there, Frankie.

01:38.645 --> 01:41.012
Rockin' the platform heels
there, too.

01:41.014 --> 01:42.047
Am I right?

01:43.250 --> 01:47.654
So, this hip explodes forward,
and the back foot swivels.

01:49.356 --> 01:50.822
That's where
your power comes from.

01:50.824 --> 01:51.892
Yeah.
Yeah, I see.

01:58.866 --> 02:01.434
Let me try that again.

02:09.943 --> 02:12.411
Let me show you.

02:12.913 --> 02:14.512
The bottom hand

02:14.514 --> 02:15.714
is your direction.

02:15.716 --> 02:17.515
Got it.

02:17.517 --> 02:19.117
Max, please!

02:19.119 --> 02:20.518
I swear, if I knew anything...

02:20.520 --> 02:21.652
- Hey! Shut up!
- ...I'd tell you.

02:21.654 --> 02:22.854
Fuck!

02:22.856 --> 02:24.355
I'm trying
to concentrate, Jimmy.

02:24.357 --> 02:25.389
All right.

02:25.391 --> 02:26.657
Max!
Max, I swear. Max!

02:26.659 --> 02:27.926
I swear on my mother's life!

02:31.064 --> 02:33.098
Oh.
You just told me...

02:33.100 --> 02:35.968
Okay.
All right.

02:37.937 --> 02:39.470
Shut up!

02:41.407 --> 02:42.439
Please!

02:42.441 --> 02:44.809
I'll tell you anything.

02:44.811 --> 02:46.977
What did I just say?!

03:02.595 --> 03:04.495
Fuck!

03:04.497 --> 03:07.031
I'll get that.

03:14.841 --> 03:16.740
You go that way.
I'll check over here.

03:16.742 --> 03:18.911
20 bucks
to whoever finds it first.

03:30.189 --> 03:31.754
Found it.

03:31.756 --> 03:33.489
Looks like
you owe me some money.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.627
Listen, I'm gonna stay out here
and have a smoke,

03:37.629 --> 03:38.929
try not to go deaf.

03:38.931 --> 03:40.064
I hear that.

03:40.066 --> 03:41.464
Do your thing, man.

03:41.466 --> 03:42.701
All right.

03:58.683 --> 04:01.084
You fucking piece of...

04:01.086 --> 04:03.119
Hey!

04:45.863 --> 04:49.232
I'm prescribing GHB
to help manage your insomnia,

04:49.234 --> 04:51.134
but it is
a controlled substance, so...

04:51.136 --> 04:53.735
I won't need it.
I'm fine.

04:53.737 --> 04:56.838
Prolonged insomnia
will lead to confusion,

04:56.840 --> 04:58.507
delirium, hallucinations,

04:58.509 --> 05:00.042
and ultimately
dementia and death,

05:00.044 --> 05:03.214
so it's critical
you at least try to sleep.

05:05.649 --> 05:07.683
You're not gonna
fill that, are you?

05:07.685 --> 05:09.251
I don't think
you're taking to heart

05:09.253 --> 05:10.953
the seriousness
of this disease.

05:10.955 --> 05:12.287
It's the reason

05:12.289 --> 05:15.090
you're being released
from prison early.

05:19.997 --> 05:22.931
Just take these
until you see the specialist.

05:22.933 --> 05:25.233
If you don't sleep,
you will die.

05:25.235 --> 05:26.535
Do you hear
what I'm saying to you?

05:26.537 --> 05:27.736
Yes.

05:30.540 --> 05:31.773
Give this to your P.O.

05:31.775 --> 05:34.076
so he knows
the medication's cleared.

05:36.046 --> 05:37.611
Take care, Frank.

05:37.613 --> 05:39.216
Thanks, Doc.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.328
Joey?

08:17.105 --> 08:19.106
I figured
you wouldn't be here.

08:20.941 --> 08:22.344
Well, I'm here.

08:23.445 --> 08:25.177
Look at you.
You look...

08:25.179 --> 08:28.113
What? 19 years older than
the last time you saw me?

08:28.115 --> 08:31.083
Well, yeah.
You look like a man now.

08:31.085 --> 08:32.119
Because I am.

08:35.155 --> 08:37.722
- Let me get that for you.
- No, I can carry it.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.659
- Are you sure?
- Really, it's not that heavy.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.796
Fine.

08:43.964 --> 08:46.265
So I guess we're walking?

08:46.267 --> 08:48.066
Well, I had to sell the car
to pay off some stuff.

08:48.068 --> 08:50.402
- You know, bills and shit.
- I'm kidding.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.070
I don't mind walking.

08:52.072 --> 08:55.943
I don't normally get
a lot of time outside, so...

09:15.529 --> 09:17.929
You sure I can't
get you something to eat,

09:17.931 --> 09:21.433
compliments of the Grand Bend
Correctional Facility payroll?

09:21.435 --> 09:22.867
No. I'm good.

09:22.869 --> 09:24.436
You sure? I mean,
look how skinny you are.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.771
You look like you haven't
had a decent meal in months.

09:26.773 --> 09:27.805
What's that
supposed to mean?

09:27.807 --> 09:29.874
Nothing. I just...

09:29.876 --> 09:31.443
I mean, it's on me,
that's all.

09:31.445 --> 09:35.046
You know, a dad likes
to buy stuff for his kid.

09:35.048 --> 09:36.115
I didn't mean anything else.

09:41.854 --> 09:44.021
The coffee
tastes the same, but...

09:45.225 --> 09:48.125
...the air
sure smells different.

09:48.127 --> 09:51.095
And it's nice just to have
a normal pair of clothes on,

09:51.097 --> 09:52.230
you know?

09:52.232 --> 09:54.198
Even those?

09:54.200 --> 09:56.234
Well, I guess they are
kind of out of date, huh?

09:56.236 --> 09:57.568
I mean, 'cause that's
what you were wearing

09:57.570 --> 09:59.172
when they hauled you away.

10:07.313 --> 10:09.080
Take US 20 towards Salem,

10:09.082 --> 10:10.948
and I'll give you
directions from there.

10:10.950 --> 10:12.283
What the fuck you want
to go out there for?

10:12.285 --> 10:13.951
I just want to look
at the old house.

10:13.953 --> 10:16.053
Been a long time
since I've seen it.

10:16.055 --> 10:19.758
Fine.
Whatever you want.

10:34.340 --> 10:36.840
You know somebody else
lives there now.

10:36.842 --> 10:38.842
The family.

10:38.844 --> 10:40.912
I just want to take
a look around.

10:43.449 --> 10:45.248
I'm only gonna be a second.

10:45.250 --> 10:48.253
I just want to see if
something I left is still there.

13:26.276 --> 13:27.642
What the hell
took you so long?

13:27.644 --> 13:28.545
Oh...

13:32.515 --> 13:34.048
What happened to you?

13:34.050 --> 13:35.452
Nothing.

13:36.586 --> 13:38.319
Look what I found.

13:38.321 --> 13:41.055
- No shit.
- Unbelievable, right?

13:41.057 --> 13:42.223
It was like
my prized possession.

13:42.225 --> 13:43.591
Not that I would've known,

13:43.593 --> 13:45.493
the way you wouldn't let
anyone else touch it,

13:45.495 --> 13:48.028
and only held it yourself
with gloves on.

13:48.030 --> 13:50.063
Yeah, or, like, tweezers.

13:50.065 --> 13:51.265
Can't believe you found it.

13:51.267 --> 13:52.633
It's still
in amazing condition.

13:52.635 --> 13:55.470
- It is.
- Probably worth a lot.

13:55.472 --> 13:56.639
Yeah.

13:57.774 --> 13:59.674
Wonder what
I could sell it for.

13:59.676 --> 14:02.042
I mean, it's got to be
a collector's item, right?

14:02.044 --> 14:04.545
Please, don't sell it.

14:04.547 --> 14:06.112
If you don't want it,

14:06.114 --> 14:08.114
I'd like to keep it,
if you don't mind.

14:08.116 --> 14:10.551
I'll give you the money for it,
if you want.

14:10.553 --> 14:11.688
Okay.

14:14.757 --> 14:16.156
So where to now?

14:16.158 --> 14:17.692
Well...

14:17.694 --> 14:20.327
You and I
are gonna live it up.

15:37.405 --> 15:38.905
What are we doing here?

15:38.907 --> 15:40.807
Meeting my parole officer.

15:42.577 --> 15:44.643
We're checking in!

15:44.645 --> 15:47.348
Compliments of
the prison payroll?

15:48.549 --> 15:50.616
After a $300 cab ride,
I don't think so.

15:50.618 --> 15:51.850
I got it covered.

15:51.852 --> 15:53.387
Keep the change.

15:56.424 --> 15:58.324
You're using their money,
aren't you?

15:58.326 --> 15:59.792
After everything
they did to you?

15:59.794 --> 16:01.293
After everything they did
to us?

16:01.295 --> 16:03.862
Hell, yes,
after everything they did to us.

16:03.864 --> 16:05.397
After everything
they did to us,

16:05.399 --> 16:07.433
I'm gonna use
every last dollar.

16:07.435 --> 16:08.934
That's the least
they owe us.

16:08.936 --> 16:09.835
Okay.

16:09.837 --> 16:11.437
Well, knock yourself out.

16:11.439 --> 16:12.638
I don't want
any part of it.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.640
Joey! No.
Joey, don't go, please.

16:14.642 --> 16:16.775
Look, I want
to show you something.

16:16.777 --> 16:17.843
Look at this.

16:17.845 --> 16:19.411
Your mother brought me here

16:19.413 --> 16:21.780
as a surprise
for our second anniversary,

16:21.782 --> 16:23.247
and I was pissed

16:23.249 --> 16:24.550
because we didn't have
a dime between us

16:24.552 --> 16:26.250
but she said
none of that mattered,

16:26.252 --> 16:28.887
we can work out anything
as long as we're together.

16:28.889 --> 16:31.557
And I always wanted
to bring her back here, but I...

16:31.559 --> 16:33.358
I didn't get
around to it, did I?

16:33.360 --> 16:35.393
But the only thing
I thought about

16:35.395 --> 16:38.496
for every minute of every day
since I got locked up

16:38.498 --> 16:40.231
was how much I wanted
to bring you here.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.801
So please... please stay.

16:42.803 --> 16:45.238
You're all I got left.

16:48.876 --> 16:50.742
- Fine.
- All right.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.278
All right.

16:54.882 --> 16:56.949
That's for you.

16:56.951 --> 16:58.418
For you.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.198
Thanks.
We'll take it from here.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.335
Hey, hey.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.303
Nice!

17:19.305 --> 17:20.538
This is a step up

17:20.540 --> 17:22.942
from my previous
accommodations, right?

17:26.980 --> 17:31.381
Joey!
Six shower heads!

17:31.383 --> 17:33.887
It's our own personal spa.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.256
We're well stocked.

17:39.258 --> 17:40.758
Want a drink?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.261
No, I'm good.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.434
Oh!

17:50.436 --> 17:52.904
Oh, my God.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.505
Oh, you have no idea how hard
prison mattresses are.

17:55.507 --> 17:56.974
I don't even think

17:56.976 --> 17:59.409
they're stuffed with cotton
or whatever, just rocks.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.745
Come on. Lie down.
You got to feel this.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.749
- I'm good.
- Come on!

18:08.054 --> 18:09.521
Joey!

18:12.458 --> 18:14.691
Well, I'm gonna
take a shower,

18:14.693 --> 18:16.827
and then let's
grab some dinner.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.830
What do you think?
Does that sound good?

18:19.832 --> 18:21.233
Joey?

19:15.453 --> 19:17.520
Now, Joey,

19:17.522 --> 19:19.789
I want you to order
whatever you want.

19:19.791 --> 19:21.757
Spare no expense.

19:21.759 --> 19:24.760
I am treating you
to the best week of your life.

19:24.762 --> 19:27.363
- Dad...
- Whatever you want, you got it.

19:27.365 --> 19:29.632
It all looks so good.

19:29.634 --> 19:31.834
So get two things.
Get three!

19:31.836 --> 19:33.702
I'm not sure
I'm all that hungry.

19:33.704 --> 19:36.038
How can you not be hungry?

19:36.040 --> 19:37.642
You haven't eaten all day.

19:40.044 --> 19:41.510
I just meant...

19:41.512 --> 19:43.445
You know I've never
been a big eater.

19:43.447 --> 19:44.680
- I know.
- Even when I was a kid.

19:44.682 --> 19:46.381
I know.

19:46.383 --> 19:48.383
For your information,
I've been clean for a while now.

19:48.385 --> 19:49.954
I didn't mean anything by it.

19:52.389 --> 19:54.455
So catch me up on your life.

19:54.457 --> 19:56.058
I want to know everything
that's been going on.

19:56.060 --> 19:57.793
You got a girl?

19:57.795 --> 19:59.762
You know, it's kind of hard
to sum up 19 years

19:59.764 --> 20:02.597
in one dinner conversation.

20:02.599 --> 20:04.066
Where are you going?

20:04.068 --> 20:05.533
Bathroom.
Just order me whatever.

20:05.535 --> 20:07.535
- I upset you. I'm sorry.
- No, I'm not upset!

20:07.537 --> 20:10.705
I have to piss.
That okay with you?

20:10.707 --> 20:12.774
Joey.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.977
Come on.
Sit with your old man!

20:43.640 --> 20:45.942
Thank you.

20:48.912 --> 20:50.647
Thank you.

20:51.915 --> 20:53.548
I love this place.

20:53.550 --> 20:55.550
It's very nice.

20:55.552 --> 20:58.620
How've you been?
I've been really well.

20:58.622 --> 21:00.021
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

21:00.023 --> 21:01.956
Guy's old enough
to be her grandfather.

21:01.958 --> 21:03.591
What took you so long?

21:03.593 --> 21:05.159
Looks even older than you.

21:05.161 --> 21:07.695
See?
There's hope for me yet.

21:07.697 --> 21:10.098
Yeah, if you got
two G's to burn.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.465
What?
You think she's...

21:11.467 --> 21:13.835
- A prostitute, yeah.
- Come on!

21:13.837 --> 21:18.806
Just saying.
Times have changed, old man.

21:20.542 --> 21:22.778
How many times
have you been there?

21:28.084 --> 21:30.918
I don't know why I didn't
bring any clothes with me.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.853
We'll go shopping
for some tomorrow.

21:32.855 --> 21:34.057
Okay.

21:35.557 --> 21:37.191
I just want to say good night.

21:37.193 --> 21:39.059
Good night.

21:39.061 --> 21:41.628
Hey.
Um...

21:41.630 --> 21:43.666
Can I show you something?

21:48.504 --> 21:49.672
I hope you like it.

21:54.944 --> 21:56.877
Solid maple.

21:56.879 --> 21:58.278
I made over 40 of them.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.780
- You made them?
- Yeah.

21:59.782 --> 22:01.248
And I actually had
orders come in

22:01.250 --> 22:04.518
from all over the country
at one time.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.720
I ended up coaching inside,

22:06.722 --> 22:08.021
and it reminded me

22:08.023 --> 22:09.656
of when you used to play
Little League

22:09.658 --> 22:12.558
and I'd help out
every now and again.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.995
I wish I had made more time
for it back then.

22:14.997 --> 22:17.164
I hated playing, anyways.

22:17.166 --> 22:19.733
No, you didn't.
You loved it.

22:19.735 --> 22:21.667
You were good at it, too.

22:21.669 --> 22:24.139
You could've made it
to the big leagues.

22:37.719 --> 22:39.821
That's not
how I remember it.

22:43.024 --> 22:46.161
Yeah, you could've,
if you'd stuck with it.

22:50.698 --> 22:52.131
Well, did you make
this one too?

22:52.133 --> 22:56.804
No. That's birch.
Not nearly as good as maple.

23:00.008 --> 23:02.274
I know I was never any good
at the whole father thing.

23:02.276 --> 23:04.110
- Dad, don't.
- No. It's true.

23:04.112 --> 23:06.879
I stank as a dad,
but I'm gonna make it up to you

23:06.881 --> 23:09.148
for being gone
when you really needed me.

23:09.150 --> 23:11.152
Yeah, like my entire life.

23:18.860 --> 23:20.693
Are you planning
on getting revenge?

23:20.695 --> 23:22.697
What? No.

23:23.898 --> 23:25.233
Really?

23:26.901 --> 23:29.701
I'm done with those people.

23:29.703 --> 23:31.303
I'm done with all of it.

23:31.305 --> 23:32.704
I'm just making sure

23:32.706 --> 23:34.639
I get you and me right
this time.

23:34.641 --> 23:37.711
You're stuck with me,
whether you like it or not.

23:39.746 --> 23:43.017
And I'm never
leaving you again.

24:36.169 --> 24:38.002
Where do you think
you're going, Pops?

24:38.004 --> 24:39.871
I'm looking for Sleepy.
I'm a friend.

24:39.873 --> 24:41.272
I think you're in
the wrong place.

24:41.274 --> 24:43.774
I don't know who the fuck
you're talking about.

24:43.776 --> 24:46.277
- That's a 226 clone.
- Yeah.

24:46.279 --> 24:48.712
You want to see it up close?
Want to suck on it?

24:48.714 --> 24:50.781
You kids like them because
you think they look cool.

24:50.783 --> 24:52.150
Truth is, it's one of

24:52.152 --> 24:53.951
the most unreliable firearms
in the world.

24:53.953 --> 24:55.819
Sights are crude,
weight's all wrong,

24:55.821 --> 24:57.288
the design's
entirely impractical,

24:57.290 --> 24:59.457
and if you don't have
just the right ammunition,

24:59.459 --> 25:00.791
it's guaranteed
to jam up on you.

25:00.793 --> 25:02.227
Come on, kid, take it easy.

25:02.229 --> 25:04.295
I'm just here to do
some business with Sleepy.

25:04.297 --> 25:09.233
Sleepy's been
dead for six years.

25:09.235 --> 25:12.271
Doesn't change
what I'm bringing to the table.

25:14.441 --> 25:16.206
So you're in charge now?

25:16.208 --> 25:19.211
Why are you asking?
'Cause I don't got a dick?

25:20.346 --> 25:23.847
The world's changed
since your day, old man.

25:23.849 --> 25:26.750
So you used to do business
with Sleepy?

25:26.752 --> 25:28.485
How'd he die?

25:28.487 --> 25:30.787
Old bastard
smoked all the time.

25:30.789 --> 25:33.290
Even burned me
when I was a baby.

25:33.292 --> 25:35.092
Accidentally.

25:35.094 --> 25:36.727
Shit.
You're Sleepy's kid?

25:36.729 --> 25:38.862
You were always
running around here,

25:38.864 --> 25:39.997
getting into things.

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
Fuck it.

25:42.001 --> 25:43.903
Let's get you a gun, yeah?

25:50.509 --> 25:53.245
Got some mad recoil,
you know.

25:54.246 --> 25:57.181
I'll take it. And a suppressor
if you've got one.

25:57.183 --> 25:58.417
I do.

26:01.786 --> 26:02.885
And a 9-millimeter.

26:02.887 --> 26:04.190
Something Italian.

26:20.171 --> 26:23.208
- Who's this?
- That's my little man, Isaiah.

26:25.343 --> 26:28.411
I guess everything
comes full circle.

26:28.413 --> 26:29.812
Yeah.

26:29.814 --> 26:31.849
Do you mind
if I give him something?

26:36.821 --> 26:38.888
I made these myself.

26:38.890 --> 26:41.524
My son's too old
to play with them,

26:41.526 --> 26:44.460
so maybe someday
you'll play.

26:44.462 --> 26:46.128
So you getting back
in the racket again?

26:46.130 --> 26:47.330
That's why
you're back in town?

26:47.332 --> 26:50.802
Just dropping in
on some old friends.

27:04.148 --> 27:06.017
Sorry. We're closed.

27:09.153 --> 27:11.356
Hey, I said we're closed.

27:12.990 --> 27:15.424
San Quentin.

27:15.426 --> 27:17.426
Frankie Fingers.

27:17.428 --> 27:20.128
I just go by Frank now.

27:20.130 --> 27:23.800
People just call me Q now.

27:27.572 --> 27:29.538
You son of a bitch!
Is that really you?

27:29.540 --> 27:33.010
Come here, man!

27:33.844 --> 27:35.478
Oh, they finally
let you out, huh?

27:35.480 --> 27:38.380
They do that sometimes
with frail old men like me.

27:38.382 --> 27:40.081
Yeah, well,
little do they know.

27:40.083 --> 27:42.017
Oh, we could write a book
about how little they know.

27:42.019 --> 27:43.151
Hey, do you still drink whiskey?

27:43.153 --> 27:44.953
Yeah.
Flies still eat shit?

27:44.955 --> 27:47.389
Well, it looks like
you've been doing well.

27:47.391 --> 27:50.560
Uh, yeah, you know,
uh, not bad.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.296
How'd they treat you
in there, Frankie?

27:54.298 --> 27:57.365
You wound up spending
a lot more time in there

27:57.367 --> 27:59.100
than we all figured.

27:59.102 --> 28:00.570
It's a damn shame.

28:02.005 --> 28:03.905
How's the wife, little girl?

28:03.907 --> 28:06.207
Not so little anymore.

28:06.209 --> 28:08.376
Isha's getting married
in three days.

28:08.378 --> 28:11.413
- No way!
- Can you believe it?

28:11.415 --> 28:13.648
Then comes Gramps
with a baby carriage.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.015
Wow.

28:15.017 --> 28:16.384
You know,
time keeps marching on.

28:16.386 --> 28:17.918
Ain't nothing
we can do about it.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.288
Marching all over my back,
my knees.

28:20.290 --> 28:24.192
Yeah, all over my knees,
and my shoulder.

28:24.194 --> 28:25.893
Hey, listen, I'd invite you,
but you know,

28:25.895 --> 28:27.329
she and her mother
have been working on

28:27.331 --> 28:29.163
that damn seating chart
for months.

28:29.165 --> 28:32.068
Oh, please, just
give her my congratulations.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.442
So I heard Max died.

28:41.277 --> 28:44.044
What, about six years ago now?

28:44.046 --> 28:46.146
Uh, yeah.

28:46.148 --> 28:48.382
Yeah, well, you know
he had that stroke?

28:48.384 --> 28:49.551
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

28:49.553 --> 28:50.918
- Yeah.
- Tough son of a bitch.

28:50.920 --> 28:53.454
He held on
for another seven years.

28:53.456 --> 28:54.521
You know...

28:56.092 --> 28:58.094
...I'm sorry as hell
about what Max did.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.128
What you had to go through.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.564
Well, it wasn't
your fault, right?

29:03.566 --> 29:06.533
I mean, could've happened
to any of us.

29:06.535 --> 29:09.436
Dice rolls the other way,
who knows?

29:09.438 --> 29:10.671
That's a very
philosophically sound

29:10.673 --> 29:12.406
way of looking at it.

29:12.408 --> 29:14.944
Well, I'm nothing now
if not philosophically sound.

29:19.148 --> 29:22.551
So, Frankie...

29:23.652 --> 29:25.119
...why are you here?

29:25.121 --> 29:26.353
What, I'm not good enough
for you now?

29:26.355 --> 29:27.954
I smell like the joint?

29:27.956 --> 29:30.056
- No.
- I wanna have a drink with you.

29:30.058 --> 29:33.260
And, uh, hoping maybe
you could tell me

29:33.262 --> 29:35.664
where I might find
Jimmy the Dragon and Tank.

29:38.166 --> 29:39.468
They're the ones
that did it, right?

29:42.638 --> 29:45.672
I need you to answer me, Q.

29:45.674 --> 29:47.741
Max ordered it,

29:47.743 --> 29:50.511
Jimmy and Tank
carried it out, yes?

29:50.513 --> 29:52.412
Yes.

29:52.414 --> 29:54.615
Yes, well, then I would
really appreciate it

29:54.617 --> 29:57.150
if you might tell me
where I could find them.

29:57.152 --> 29:58.652
I'm out of that world.

29:58.654 --> 30:00.086
Nobody's ever really out.

30:00.088 --> 30:01.521
That's where
you're wrong, see?

30:01.523 --> 30:03.623
'Cause I haven't seen them
in five, six years.

30:03.625 --> 30:05.291
- You sure?
- Yeah.

30:05.293 --> 30:07.026
- How about now?
- Oh, hey.

30:07.028 --> 30:10.029
Frankie. I swear, okay?
I don't know where they are.

30:10.031 --> 30:11.030
Don't lie to me.

30:11.032 --> 30:12.165
I'm not lying to you!

30:12.167 --> 30:15.067
Okay?
Look, come on, man. We...

30:15.069 --> 30:16.938
We were brothers back
in the day, right?

30:22.210 --> 30:23.545
Right.

30:25.113 --> 30:26.612
I'm sorry.

30:29.717 --> 30:32.185
Forget about it.

30:32.187 --> 30:34.422
I understand.

30:36.191 --> 30:37.559
Where's the bathroom?

30:38.660 --> 30:41.396
- It's in the back.
- Excuse me.

31:29.176 --> 31:30.609
You okay?

31:30.611 --> 31:32.544
Yeah.

31:32.546 --> 31:35.547
You know what
I was just thinking about?

31:35.549 --> 31:38.350
That kid we ran
the collection on.

31:38.352 --> 31:42.587
What was his name?
Bobby Greenstreet or Greenbean?

31:42.589 --> 31:44.256
Back in '93.

31:44.258 --> 31:46.324
- '92.
- Right.

31:46.326 --> 31:48.793
He had that sawed-off
and the kitty litter.

31:48.795 --> 31:51.496
He was gonna blow
a big fat hole in your chest.

31:51.498 --> 31:54.298
And then you tackled me
out of the way.

31:54.300 --> 31:56.768
Yeah, and the spray chewed up
my shoulder pretty good.

31:56.770 --> 32:00.705
But then Isha was born...

32:00.707 --> 32:04.208
What, two, three days later?

32:04.210 --> 32:06.277
Yeah. It wasn't the first time
you saved my ass.

32:06.279 --> 32:09.248
And then you saved mine
just the next week.

32:10.817 --> 32:14.819
Look, Frank. I don't know where
Jimmy and the Tank are, okay?

32:14.821 --> 32:18.224
But maybe I can help you
figure out how to find them.

32:19.492 --> 32:23.162
All right.
That's good enough for me.

33:04.770 --> 33:07.605
<i>It's critical
you at least try to sleep.</i>

33:07.607 --> 33:10.507
<i>Prolonged insomnia
will lead to confusion,</i>

33:10.509 --> 33:12.375
<i>delirium,
hallucinations,</i>

33:12.377 --> 33:14.511
<i>and ultimately dementia.</i>

33:14.513 --> 33:16.181
<i>If you don't sleep,
you will die.</i>

33:37.469 --> 33:40.605
Hey, are you gonna sleep
the whole day away?

33:41.840 --> 33:44.743
Joey?

33:49.848 --> 33:51.383
Hey.

33:53.351 --> 33:54.819
Hey, Joey?

33:59.924 --> 34:01.559
Joey!

34:03.595 --> 34:05.363
Joey!

34:07.264 --> 34:10.232
Joey!

34:10.234 --> 34:11.902
Joey!

34:12.771 --> 34:14.469
Joey!

34:14.472 --> 34:16.938
Joey! Joey!

34:16.940 --> 34:18.541
Dad! Dad...

34:18.543 --> 34:20.710
- People are still sleeping.
- Where were you?

34:20.712 --> 34:22.645
I went down
to get some coffee.

34:22.647 --> 34:24.446
I thought you were gone.

34:24.447 --> 34:26.313
Well, I-I'm still here,
all right?

34:26.315 --> 34:28.650
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good.

34:28.652 --> 34:31.353
Plus, you promised
to buy me shit.

34:31.355 --> 34:33.956
I'm not gonna
miss out on that.

34:33.958 --> 34:36.558
But aside from spending
lots of money on me,

34:36.560 --> 34:38.895
what's the plan for today, huh?

34:38.897 --> 34:41.596
We're making up
for lost time.

34:43.967 --> 34:45.902
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

34:45.904 --> 34:48.036
You do that very well, Tracey.

34:48.039 --> 34:50.839
♪ Please bring me
my watches ♪

34:50.841 --> 34:53.375
They're too much.
It's not me.

34:53.377 --> 34:55.677
No, we're getting 'em,
both of them,

34:55.679 --> 34:59.450
and I'll be paying cash,
by the way.

35:03.821 --> 35:06.021
Wow.

35:06.023 --> 35:07.489
Clean up pretty well.

35:07.491 --> 35:09.860
You're looking good
yourself, sexy.

35:17.534 --> 35:19.300
Welcome to the 21st century,
old man.

35:23.707 --> 35:25.241
Thanks.

35:27.778 --> 35:30.411
- She's all yours.
- What?

35:30.413 --> 35:31.646
To make up
for all the birthdays

35:31.648 --> 35:32.914
and Christmases I missed.

35:34.350 --> 35:36.651
Shit. I...

35:36.653 --> 35:38.452
Well, I want you
to take the first spin

35:38.454 --> 35:39.855
since you haven't been
behind the wheel

35:39.857 --> 35:41.422
since you last drove
a getaway car.

35:41.424 --> 35:44.525
Ha ha.
Happily!

35:45.762 --> 35:49.530
Rrow! Rrow!

35:49.532 --> 35:51.532
You hear that?
Do you hear that?

35:51.534 --> 35:52.533
Pops.

35:52.535 --> 35:54.270
Rrow!
Let's go!

36:07.083 --> 36:08.682
There you go!

36:21.430 --> 36:23.430
Now, this is livin'.

36:23.432 --> 36:25.533
You said a mouthful.

36:26.702 --> 36:28.536
Expensive car.

36:28.538 --> 36:30.738
Expensive suit.

36:30.740 --> 36:31.839
Oh, and what is this?

36:31.841 --> 36:33.908
No wife with you?
Girlfriend?

36:33.910 --> 36:35.508
Mistress?

36:35.510 --> 36:36.877
What kind of stupid
question is that?

36:36.879 --> 36:38.646
No, no, I was just wondering

36:38.648 --> 36:41.615
if you're looking to get out
and have some fun tonight.

36:41.617 --> 36:43.684
Sorry, kid. I'm just here
to spend time with my son.

36:43.686 --> 36:48.055
Okay, well, if you or your son
find yourselves in the need,

36:48.057 --> 36:52.559
I run a premium service
with premium ladies, so...

36:52.561 --> 36:55.597
My name's Trip.
Give me a call.

36:56.933 --> 36:59.465
You should probably
hang on to that.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.168
I mean, he could see
how hard up you are

37:01.170 --> 37:02.437
from like a mile away.

37:04.439 --> 37:05.373
All right.

37:07.876 --> 37:13.446
You remember how you asked me
if I had a girl?

37:13.448 --> 37:14.881
Well, I do.

37:14.883 --> 37:16.749
And it's getting
pretty serious.

37:16.751 --> 37:18.885
Oh, my God.

37:18.887 --> 37:20.787
Well, that's wonderful.

37:20.789 --> 37:22.555
I'm... I'm so happy for you.

37:22.557 --> 37:23.725
Thanks.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.595
Her name's Lorraine.

37:28.063 --> 37:30.530
- Just like your mother.
- Yeah.

37:30.532 --> 37:32.601
It's a weird coincidence,
huh?

37:34.202 --> 37:35.871
Maybe it's fate.

37:36.938 --> 37:39.505
Maybe.

37:39.507 --> 37:42.909
I'm... I'm sorry
I never visited you at prison.

37:42.911 --> 37:44.143
Oh, that's okay.

37:44.145 --> 37:45.678
No. No.
I wanted to.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.116
I wouldn't have
visited me either.

37:49.050 --> 37:53.820
Look, by way of explanation
and not excuse,

37:53.822 --> 37:56.789
I was trying to give you
a better life.

37:56.791 --> 37:59.524
I mean, it was obviously
the stupidest plan,

37:59.526 --> 38:02.461
in hindsight,
but that is what I wanted,

38:02.463 --> 38:04.998
to get you out of the racket.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.469
And all I did was get you stuck
right in the middle of it.

38:09.536 --> 38:13.672
Well, we're both out of it now.

38:13.674 --> 38:17.043
Today is our day
to try again.

38:17.045 --> 38:20.545
That's a line from a kid's book
Mom used to read me.

38:20.547 --> 38:21.546
"Mistakes you will make,

38:21.548 --> 38:22.915
but it's not the end,

38:22.917 --> 38:24.816
because today is the day
to try again."

38:24.818 --> 38:29.621
"Today is your day
to try again."

38:29.623 --> 38:31.556
Yeah.

38:31.558 --> 38:33.494
It sure is.

38:36.096 --> 38:38.630
I just love
these father-and-son watches.

38:38.632 --> 38:40.098
I know, and, honestly,
I always wanted these.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.767
Yeah, and you know,
this suit is perfect.

38:41.769 --> 38:43.001
The color is perfect for you.

38:43.003 --> 38:44.903
It kicks up
the blue in your eyes.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.738
- Right? I feel I kind of match.
- It's a total transformation.

38:46.740 --> 38:47.739
Shh. Shh. Shh.

38:47.741 --> 38:51.243
Go talk to her.

38:51.245 --> 38:52.778
What, are you nuts?

38:52.780 --> 38:54.512
Offer to buy her a drink
at the bar.

38:54.514 --> 38:56.715
I can't just go offer to buy her
a drink, look at her!

38:56.717 --> 38:59.017
She's not looking
for Prince-fucking-Valiant.

38:59.019 --> 39:01.088
All that can be yours
for two G's.

39:02.156 --> 39:03.855
In your case, maybe three.
Still.

39:03.857 --> 39:05.756
No.
I'm here to be with you.

39:05.758 --> 39:09.027
And you have.
And you will.

39:09.029 --> 39:11.196
But don't forget, there are
a lot of other aspects of life

39:11.198 --> 39:12.663
you've missed out on,

39:12.665 --> 39:14.132
getting laid
being one of them.

39:14.134 --> 39:15.934
Yeah.

39:15.936 --> 39:17.535
Unless, of course,
you know,

39:17.537 --> 39:19.004
you haven't missed out on that.

39:19.006 --> 39:20.671
I've heard
what goes on in prison.

39:20.673 --> 39:22.540
- Stop it.
- Hey, I'm not judging.

39:22.542 --> 39:24.211
Whatever swings your bat.

39:25.745 --> 39:26.744
- All right.
- All right.

39:26.746 --> 39:27.878
- I'm going.
- Okay.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.882
- Watch this.
- Okay.

39:37.190 --> 39:42.159
I haven't been with anyone
since your mother.

39:42.161 --> 39:45.796
Well, it's like, um,

39:45.798 --> 39:47.331
falling off a bike

39:47.333 --> 39:48.699
into a vagina.

39:50.203 --> 39:51.637
Don't be crude.

39:53.639 --> 39:55.740
Look, you look beautiful.

39:55.742 --> 39:57.908
You smell pretty, too.

39:57.910 --> 39:59.710
Come on.
You got this!

39:59.712 --> 40:01.114
Go on.

40:15.761 --> 40:16.793
Hi.

40:16.795 --> 40:18.661
Hello. Uh...

40:18.663 --> 40:19.964
Um, I'm Frank.

40:19.966 --> 40:21.566
Simone.

40:23.136 --> 40:27.804
I'm... I'm... I'm very happy
to meet you, Simone.

40:29.741 --> 40:32.709
You're a real gentleman,
aren't you?

40:32.711 --> 40:34.811
An endangered species.

40:34.813 --> 40:38.182
But not extinct.
Not yet.

40:38.184 --> 40:40.717
Huh.

41:00.338 --> 41:02.307
You're so good.

41:04.910 --> 41:06.676
You mean for an old man.

41:06.678 --> 41:09.345
Ohh!
For any man.

41:09.347 --> 41:10.849
Wow.

41:14.219 --> 41:15.718
Really?

41:15.720 --> 41:18.654
Yeah, you're amazing.

41:20.392 --> 41:23.159
- You must be hot in this.
- No. No, I'm fine.

41:23.161 --> 41:24.693
- Take it off.
- I'm fine.

41:24.695 --> 41:27.232
Oh, what?
You're gonna be modest now?

41:28.766 --> 41:30.068
Oh, wow.

41:31.369 --> 41:33.669
You did time.

41:33.671 --> 41:35.338
A little bit.

41:35.340 --> 41:38.374
How much is a little bit?

41:38.376 --> 41:39.677
19 years.

41:40.778 --> 41:42.945
I'd say that's more than
a little bit, wouldn't you?

41:42.947 --> 41:45.781
I'm harmless, I promise.

41:45.783 --> 41:49.852
Really.
I swear.

41:49.854 --> 41:51.720
Well, I think
it's kind of sexy.

41:51.722 --> 41:54.723
Huh.
Yeah, right.

41:54.725 --> 41:56.959
So, what did you do?

41:56.961 --> 41:59.429
Did you kill a man?

41:59.431 --> 42:01.964
Was it over a woman?

42:01.966 --> 42:05.267
Honestly,
I'd rather not say.

42:09.206 --> 42:10.841
I was just intrigued.

42:13.377 --> 42:15.412
What? You're really not
gonna tell me?

42:17.047 --> 42:19.750
Now I'm not so sure
about the "harmless" part.

42:29.827 --> 42:31.860
Here's a thousand for the hour.

42:31.862 --> 42:35.063
And another thousand
for being nice.

42:35.065 --> 42:38.300
You really know how
to make a girl feel special.

42:38.302 --> 42:40.204
I thought
that's how it works.

42:41.272 --> 42:42.737
It is.

42:42.739 --> 42:44.739
Wait. Wait.

42:44.741 --> 42:47.875
Jesus Christ,
I screw everything up.

42:47.877 --> 42:49.211
I'm sorry.

42:49.213 --> 42:50.845
Really.

42:50.847 --> 42:52.414
It's okay.

42:52.416 --> 42:55.049
Do you have to go?

42:55.051 --> 42:58.152
Do you have
a little more time for me?

42:58.154 --> 42:59.822
It'll cost you.

43:03.893 --> 43:05.226
Ha!

43:08.998 --> 43:12.168
Oh, no, no!
No, my scarf!

43:28.952 --> 43:32.019
I took the rap for my boss.

43:32.021 --> 43:34.388
He's the one
that killed the guy, so...

43:34.390 --> 43:37.158
He was a big-shot bagman
on the Upper East Side

43:37.160 --> 43:38.426
with a lot of friends.

43:38.428 --> 43:41.062
A lot of cop friends,
as it turned out.

43:41.064 --> 43:42.896
How'd he kill him?

43:42.898 --> 43:46.234
Ah, he beat his head in
with a baseball bat.

43:46.236 --> 43:48.169
Jesus.

43:48.171 --> 43:51.405
W-Why would you go to prison
for a man like that?

43:51.407 --> 43:52.442
Got a huge payout.

43:54.810 --> 43:57.178
That's just the way we did it
in my line of work.

43:57.180 --> 43:59.313
Or what used to be
my line of work.

43:59.315 --> 44:01.047
Did what you were told.

44:01.049 --> 44:03.850
You know, kept your mouth shut
and did what you're told.

44:03.852 --> 44:06.320
But that's horrible.

44:06.322 --> 44:08.255
Yes and no.

44:08.257 --> 44:11.124
At the time, the guy
was like family to me.

44:11.126 --> 44:13.394
We took care of each other.

44:13.396 --> 44:15.262
I looked after him.

44:15.264 --> 44:18.532
He looked after me
and my family.

44:18.534 --> 44:20.300
You have a wife and kids?

44:20.302 --> 44:22.869
My wife died a long time ago.

44:22.871 --> 44:24.170
Um...

44:24.172 --> 44:28.143
I just have the boy,
the one son.

44:29.544 --> 44:32.047
He's all grown up now.

44:33.081 --> 44:35.849
God, that must have been hard
for the both of you.

44:35.851 --> 44:38.318
I can't imagine being away
from my son

44:38.320 --> 44:39.919
for more than
a couple of days,

44:39.921 --> 44:41.990
let alone...

44:43.425 --> 44:45.158
- Shit.
- What?

44:45.160 --> 44:47.294
Nothing.
I just, um...

44:47.296 --> 44:50.863
I have a policy
of not telling my clients

44:50.865 --> 44:52.399
about my personal life.

44:52.401 --> 44:56.902
I keep it strictly business.

44:56.904 --> 44:59.040
Usually.

45:03.345 --> 45:05.946
But I guess
you're different.

45:32.641 --> 45:34.542
<i>You okay?</i>

45:37.411 --> 45:39.178
Yeah.

45:39.180 --> 45:40.579
You sure?

45:40.581 --> 45:42.350
You want me to stop?

46:06.607 --> 46:07.972
Oh...

46:26.460 --> 46:28.328
That's serious.

46:30.130 --> 46:32.430
It's a combat wound.

46:32.432 --> 46:34.365
Ah, World War II?

46:34.367 --> 46:35.734
Ha ha.

46:35.736 --> 46:37.268
Thanks.

46:37.270 --> 46:41.439
No, that was a, uh,
disgruntled client.

46:41.441 --> 46:43.476
Perils of the job.

46:45.011 --> 46:47.211
Wait,
someone fucking shot you?

46:47.213 --> 46:48.646
Yeah, they tried.

46:48.648 --> 46:51.149
Yeah, they succeeded!

46:51.151 --> 46:53.620
If they'd succeeded,
I'd be dead.

46:58.258 --> 47:00.193
Oh, I got something for you.

47:05.732 --> 47:07.432
Vitamin E.

47:07.434 --> 47:11.171
It, uh, it helps nourish
the scar tissue.

47:12.672 --> 47:17.040
No, seriously.
I use it all the time.

47:17.042 --> 47:19.477
W-What for?
Your skin looks perfect.

47:19.479 --> 47:22.415
Exactly.

47:23.583 --> 47:25.050
There.

47:28.253 --> 47:29.556
Thank you.

47:31.123 --> 47:32.725
You're welcome.

47:35.227 --> 47:37.062
Oh, right here's good.

47:38.430 --> 47:41.097
Let me get the door.
It's a little tricky.

47:44.604 --> 47:49.074
Well, thank you
for a lovely evening, Frank.

47:50.209 --> 47:51.642
Simone?

47:51.644 --> 47:54.244
Uh, I-I was thinking...

47:54.246 --> 47:57.547
I don't know, but maybe we could
do this again.

47:57.549 --> 47:59.316
Okay.

47:59.318 --> 48:01.318
All you got to do is call.

48:01.320 --> 48:04.223
I mean, without
the business side of things.

48:05.457 --> 48:06.492
Oh.

48:07.759 --> 48:10.427
I'm sorry.
That was stupid of me.

48:10.429 --> 48:12.796
I-I get a little carried away
sometimes.

48:12.798 --> 48:15.365
Oh, shit.
I broke your heart.

48:15.367 --> 48:17.167
What? No.
Not possible!

48:17.169 --> 48:18.602
It's made of cast iron.
See?

48:18.604 --> 48:20.170
Ah!

48:20.172 --> 48:23.473
Anyway, I'll, uh,
call your service tomorrow,

48:23.475 --> 48:25.275
and maybe we can have
some dinner,

48:25.277 --> 48:26.776
so I can make it up to you.

48:26.778 --> 48:28.077
Make what up to me?

48:28.079 --> 48:30.145
Me being a stupid old man.

48:31.215 --> 48:33.617
All right. Dinner.

48:33.619 --> 48:35.150
Tomorrow.

48:35.152 --> 48:37.721
Call the service.
You got the number.

48:37.723 --> 48:39.056
- I do.
- Okay.

48:40.626 --> 48:41.858
Hey, e-excuse me.

48:43.194 --> 48:44.796
Is Simone really your name?

48:46.465 --> 48:48.097
No.

48:48.099 --> 48:49.500
It's Jennifer.

49:57.200 --> 50:00.705
Hey, baby. You want to
play with the Dragon?

50:14.484 --> 50:17.552
I had no idea
this was your scene, Jimmy.

50:17.554 --> 50:19.387
It's the 21st century,
Frankie.

50:19.389 --> 50:21.623
A man can pamper himself.

50:21.625 --> 50:23.426
Indulge.

50:24.361 --> 50:25.528
Bitches, leave.

50:29.232 --> 50:33.201
Not nice to deprive a guy
of his happy ending.

50:33.203 --> 50:35.970
Prison life agreed with you.
You look fit.

50:35.972 --> 50:38.239
You dropped
a couple of pounds, I see.

50:38.241 --> 50:39.240
Cover up.

50:39.242 --> 50:40.608
What?

50:40.610 --> 50:42.243
Oh.

50:42.245 --> 50:44.946
Is that making you
uncomfortable?

50:44.948 --> 50:46.981
I can understand why.

50:46.983 --> 50:51.352
They don't call me the Dragon
because of my tattoo.

50:51.354 --> 50:53.888
Ah, you're a pretty smug
piece of shit

50:53.890 --> 50:56.457
for a guy who's got
a gun pointed at his head.

50:56.459 --> 50:57.592
It's not the first time.

50:57.594 --> 50:59.460
Probably won't be the last.

50:59.462 --> 51:00.828
Oh, it's your last.

51:00.830 --> 51:03.365
But you're gonna
explain something to me first.

51:04.366 --> 51:05.602
Then you might as well
shoot me.

51:07.737 --> 51:09.839
Because I haven't a clue
where Max has been hiding.

51:11.775 --> 51:12.842
Max...

51:14.778 --> 51:16.645
...is alive?

51:17.914 --> 51:20.447
Oh, shit.

51:54.917 --> 51:56.719
Just like the old days,
baby!

51:57.720 --> 51:59.220
Where do you think
you're going?

52:14.636 --> 52:16.772
Sorry, Frankie.
Nothing personal.

52:32.420 --> 52:34.320
Finally!

52:34.322 --> 52:36.390
You know how long I've been
waiting for you, young man?

52:39.827 --> 52:43.297
Thought you guys might've
ran off to Vegas to get married.

52:46.834 --> 52:49.435
So how was she?

52:49.437 --> 52:50.838
Was she incredible?

52:52.840 --> 52:54.006
You guys sleep at all,

52:54.008 --> 52:56.776
or you just at it
the whole time?

52:56.778 --> 52:58.110
Oh, nice.

52:58.112 --> 53:00.713
Your doctor gave you
the good stuff, huh?

53:06.487 --> 53:07.720
You gonna tell me anything?

53:07.722 --> 53:09.655
Can't talk
about it right now.

53:09.657 --> 53:10.990
Come on!

53:10.992 --> 53:12.525
First time you make mercury
in 19 years,

53:12.527 --> 53:13.993
and I don't get anything?

53:13.995 --> 53:15.730
Was she loud?

53:17.832 --> 53:18.933
What the hell
happened to you?

53:20.433 --> 53:23.736
Dad! What the hell
happened to you?

53:23.738 --> 53:25.638
- Answer me!
- What do you think happened?

53:25.640 --> 53:27.605
I met up with Jimmy the Dragon
and we had it out!

53:27.607 --> 53:29.607
- You killed him?
- Sadly, no.

53:29.609 --> 53:31.043
What the fuck?
You hid an arsenal in here

53:31.045 --> 53:32.410
the whole fucking time?

53:32.412 --> 53:33.745
You said you were
done with them!

53:33.747 --> 53:35.480
You said you weren't
looking to get even!

53:35.482 --> 53:37.715
Scores have to be settled.

53:37.717 --> 53:39.386
Says who?!

53:40.487 --> 53:41.887
You're a big fucking liar!

53:41.889 --> 53:44.023
- I'm doing this for you!
- That's bullshit!

53:44.025 --> 53:45.890
I am doing this for you!
Everything I do is for you!

53:45.892 --> 53:47.759
Oh, so it's all on me, huh?

53:47.761 --> 53:49.894
You getting locked up for two
fucking decades, that's on me?

53:49.896 --> 53:50.895
Yes!

53:50.897 --> 53:52.164
Because every penny I made,

53:52.166 --> 53:53.598
you took and you snorted
it up your nose

53:53.600 --> 53:55.500
and you shot it
in your veins!

53:55.502 --> 53:57.502
Oh, what?
Am I out of order?

53:57.504 --> 53:59.539
You think I'm fucking
using right now?

54:00.774 --> 54:02.073
Do you?

54:02.075 --> 54:03.508
Take a fucking look!

54:03.510 --> 54:06.110
Take a good fucking look!
All right?

54:06.112 --> 54:08.913
You satisfied, Detective?

54:08.915 --> 54:11.916
I don't understand why you care
all of a sudden.

54:11.918 --> 54:13.918
<i>Now</i> you want to teach me
right from wrong?

54:13.920 --> 54:16.588
Like you're my father?

54:16.590 --> 54:18.890
Like you're some shining
fucking example?

54:18.892 --> 54:20.692
- You better walk away.
- What are you gonna do?

54:20.694 --> 54:22.660
You're gonna knock me out?

54:22.662 --> 54:24.494
Huh?

54:24.496 --> 54:26.496
You know, why don't you reach
into that big black bag of yours

54:26.498 --> 54:27.531
and do it right?

54:27.533 --> 54:29.736
How about that, Dad?

54:31.437 --> 54:32.937
I got to go.

54:32.939 --> 54:34.939
You can lie to yourself
all you want,

54:34.941 --> 54:36.040
but I'm done with it!

54:36.042 --> 54:37.507
You hear me?

54:37.509 --> 54:38.977
You walk out that door
and I'm gone!

54:38.979 --> 54:40.444
That's it!

54:40.446 --> 54:43.049
You're never gonna
see me again.

56:03.828 --> 56:05.496
Frankie.

56:07.665 --> 56:09.099
Hiya, Tank.

56:09.101 --> 56:11.736
"Tank."

56:12.937 --> 56:16.005
Man, no one's called me that
in a long time.

56:17.675 --> 56:19.644
I heard you got out.

56:21.579 --> 56:23.715
I figured you'd come
looking for me.

56:27.618 --> 56:30.119
How you doing?

56:30.121 --> 56:32.088
Not too bad.

56:32.090 --> 56:34.692
- You?
- Can't complain.

56:36.094 --> 56:38.728
I mean, I've been having
some troubles with my hands

56:38.730 --> 56:40.830
a little bit.

56:40.832 --> 56:43.132
I think I may be
getting some arthritis.

56:43.134 --> 56:45.101
- That sucks.
- Ah, it happens.

56:45.103 --> 56:48.004
Makes working
kind of difficult.

56:48.006 --> 56:50.638
Never figured you the type
for legitimate work.

56:50.640 --> 56:52.208
Got to stay busy somehow,
right?

56:52.210 --> 56:54.912
It's not like I got a family
or anything. It's just me.

56:57.714 --> 57:00.782
Life never really turns out
the way you plan it.

57:00.784 --> 57:04.120
No. It doesn't.

57:04.122 --> 57:06.654
Anyway...

57:06.656 --> 57:10.192
You got to do
what you came here for, so...

57:10.194 --> 57:13.264
You're not gonna run?
Put up a fight?

57:14.232 --> 57:17.233
I figure I've outrun
what I got coming to me

57:17.235 --> 57:19.034
way longer
than I deserve.

57:19.036 --> 57:21.104
One thing first,
if you don't mind.

57:22.973 --> 57:24.939
Do you know
where I can find Max?

57:24.941 --> 57:27.142
I don't.

57:27.144 --> 57:30.379
Last time I saw him
was before he had his stroke.

57:30.381 --> 57:36.785
So you don't know anything
about him faking his death?

57:36.787 --> 57:39.654
Well, actually,
I did hear something.

57:39.656 --> 57:41.823
I heard a few guys
talking about that,

57:41.825 --> 57:45.160
but I wasn't sure
if it wasn't just talk.

57:45.162 --> 57:47.097
I wish I could help you.

57:48.198 --> 57:50.767
I mean, I know I owe you.

57:53.904 --> 57:55.136
Wait. Do you know...
You know what?

57:55.138 --> 57:56.905
I don't know, I'm not sure,
but may...

57:56.907 --> 57:58.740
maybe I did
hear something about his kid

57:58.742 --> 58:01.078
dumping him in
an old-folk home a while back.

58:02.312 --> 58:04.047
Thank you.

58:09.685 --> 58:12.588
Frankie, Frankie, Frankie.
Frankie.

58:14.690 --> 58:17.825
Hey, look,
I'm really sorry, man.

59:46.948 --> 59:48.281
to know when
it was time to get out.

59:48.283 --> 59:50.183

gonna die either way.

01:00:25.053 --> 01:00:28.020

you and I.

01:00:28.022 --> 01:00:30.789
Made a lot of bad choices
that now we just

Look, why don't you come
to Isha's wedding tomorrow?

01:00:35.862 --> 01:00:38.029
Be a part of some real-life
shit. It'll be good for you.

01:00:38.031 --> 01:00:41.132
You can even bring somebody,
okay? A date.

01:00:41.134 --> 01:00:42.867
Maybe you'll even meet
a nice woman there.

01:00:42.869 --> 01:00:44.869
I don't know.

01:00:44.871 --> 01:00:46.372
Well, think about it.

01:00:46.374 --> 01:00:49.040
We'd love to have you.

01:00:49.042 --> 01:00:50.744
You're family.

01:00:51.945 --> 01:00:53.981
Yeah, maybe.

01:01:40.893 --> 01:01:42.095
Joey?

01:01:43.863 --> 01:01:45.265
Hey, Joey?

01:01:51.571 --> 01:01:54.472
Oh.
Sorry.

01:01:54.474 --> 01:01:57.377
No, it's okay.
Just do your work.

01:02:50.129 --> 01:02:52.298
<i>¿Habla Inglés?</i>

01:03:12.485 --> 01:03:13.950
Uh, hey,

01:03:13.952 --> 01:03:16.052
kid, can you help me
with something?

01:03:16.054 --> 01:03:17.255
Of course, sir.

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:27.063
I have to call my son,

01:03:27.065 --> 01:03:31.134
and I have no idea how
to work this damn thing.

01:03:31.136 --> 01:03:35.238
Well, uh, I can certainly
help you with that, Mister...?

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:38.207
- Carver.
- Mr. Carver.

01:03:38.209 --> 01:03:41.577
See, I just find
your address book app.

01:03:41.579 --> 01:03:43.980
Uh, what is your son's name?

01:03:43.982 --> 01:03:45.715
Uh, Joey. Joseph.

01:03:45.717 --> 01:03:48.985
It's, uh... It's empty.

01:03:48.987 --> 01:03:52.321
Oh, yeah. I just
got the thing yesterday.

01:03:52.323 --> 01:03:55.023
Well, has he called you
since, or...

01:03:55.025 --> 01:03:57.660
He, uh, um,

01:03:57.662 --> 01:03:59.529
"face-called" me
yesterday.

01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:00.996
Uh, great.

01:04:00.998 --> 01:04:02.265
So, um,

01:04:02.267 --> 01:04:04.300
I just find the phone app...

01:04:04.302 --> 01:04:05.501
Uh-huh.

01:04:05.503 --> 01:04:07.303
...and go
to your call history.

01:04:07.305 --> 01:04:09.273
- Oh.
- Here. And...

01:04:10.675 --> 01:04:12.475
Yeah, that's empty, too.

01:04:12.477 --> 01:04:14.477
Aw, shit.
Really?

01:04:14.479 --> 01:04:17.780
Maybe you accidentally
cleared it, or...?

01:04:17.782 --> 01:04:20.483
I wouldn't put it past me.

01:04:20.485 --> 01:04:22.350
Is there any way
you can get it back?

01:04:22.352 --> 01:04:24.152
I'm awfully sorry, sir.

01:04:24.154 --> 01:04:26.421
Oh, that's okay.

01:04:26.423 --> 01:04:28.658
Thank you.

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:31.259
Uh, hey, but you can...

01:04:31.261 --> 01:04:33.628
you can use this thing
to get on the Web, right?

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:35.096
Most definitely, sir.

01:04:35.098 --> 01:04:37.499
Okay, well, then,
can you look up

01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:40.235
all the nursing homes
in the area...

01:04:40.237 --> 01:04:42.070
no, in the state, actually...

01:04:42.072 --> 01:04:44.239
a-and write me up
a list and...

01:04:44.241 --> 01:04:45.740
Mr. Carver, I can't...

01:04:45.742 --> 01:04:47.478
I'll give you $500.

01:04:49.746 --> 01:04:51.746
L-Let me grab a pad, yeah.

01:04:51.748 --> 01:04:54.151
Good man.

01:05:17.808 --> 01:05:20.042
I'm dying.

01:05:23.847 --> 01:05:27.381
They told me I had

01:05:27.383 --> 01:05:31.120
fatal sporadic insomnia.

01:05:32.355 --> 01:05:34.188
I can't sleep.

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:36.825
There's something wrong
with my brain.

01:05:36.827 --> 01:05:41.464
It's incurable.

01:05:43.566 --> 01:05:47.603
And untreatable.

01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:52.506
God, I'm...

01:05:52.508 --> 01:05:54.308
I'm sorry, sir.

01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:57.578
Well, at least
I get to take

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.782
a few of them
down with me, right?

01:06:03.853 --> 01:06:06.322
Joey?

01:06:08.157 --> 01:06:10.124
Joey, is that you?

01:06:10.126 --> 01:06:11.292
It's Simone!

01:06:11.294 --> 01:06:13.661
Oh, shit.

01:06:13.663 --> 01:06:16.198
Simone.
Oh, shit.

01:06:25.474 --> 01:06:27.140
Ah!

01:06:27.142 --> 01:06:30.878
Simone!
I'm sorry, honey.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:35.148
I forgot about
our dinner plans.

01:06:42.223 --> 01:06:44.725
Hi, sweetie.

01:06:44.727 --> 01:06:46.526
Who are you?

01:06:46.528 --> 01:06:49.930
I'm Simone, baby.
You called me for a date?

01:06:49.932 --> 01:06:53.366
Y-You're not Simone.

01:06:53.368 --> 01:06:57.505
I assure you, honey, I am.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.307
Mm. You gonna fix me
a drink, or what?

01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:05.411
There's been a mistake.
I called for the other Simone.

01:07:05.413 --> 01:07:08.281
She's this tall,
has dark hair.

01:07:08.283 --> 01:07:09.782
Real name's Jennifer.

01:07:09.784 --> 01:07:11.784
I don't know, baby.
I guess she couldn't make it.

01:07:11.786 --> 01:07:13.386
Hi, cutie.

01:07:13.388 --> 01:07:15.254
It's gonna cost you extra
if he's watching.

01:07:15.256 --> 01:07:16.689
Why?

01:07:16.691 --> 01:07:18.691
Why can't she make it?

01:07:18.693 --> 01:07:23.396
Why are you so stuck
on this other girl, sweetie?

01:07:23.398 --> 01:07:25.832
I'm right here,
and she's not.

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:28.768
Well, you see, <i>sweetie,</i>

01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:30.637
you're not the girl
I called for,

01:07:30.639 --> 01:07:32.204
so you're gonna
have to leave.

01:07:32.206 --> 01:07:33.673
I'm not fucking you.

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:35.942
Get your fucking meat paws
off me, you ugly fuck!

01:07:35.944 --> 01:07:39.648
Shut the fuck up and get out,
you phony piece of shit.

01:07:49.891 --> 01:07:53.293
Jesus Christ.
Now what?

01:07:55.629 --> 01:07:56.829
Hello?

01:07:56.831 --> 01:07:57.964
Hey, Frank.

01:07:57.966 --> 01:07:59.598
Yeah?

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.634
It's Trip.

01:08:01.702 --> 01:08:04.436
Aw, come on, don't tell me
you don't remember me.

01:08:04.438 --> 01:08:06.271
From the other day?

01:08:06.273 --> 01:08:08.007
"Expensive car,
expensive suit..."

01:08:08.009 --> 01:08:09.675
Yeah, I remember you.

01:08:09.677 --> 01:08:11.810
So the Presidential Suite, huh?

01:08:11.812 --> 01:08:13.845
How much you have to pay
for a room like that,

01:08:13.847 --> 01:08:14.946
if you don't mind me asking?

01:08:14.948 --> 01:08:16.782
Actually, I do mind.

01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:19.653
That's me.

01:08:28.662 --> 01:08:30.895
Hi, Frank.
Got a minute?

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:31.997
No.

01:08:31.999 --> 01:08:33.698
Ooh.

01:08:33.701 --> 01:08:35.033
Oh, yeah!

01:08:35.035 --> 01:08:37.803
Look at this place, huh?

01:08:37.805 --> 01:08:40.206
Fucking top tier!

01:08:40.941 --> 01:08:43.608
I hope I can afford
a room like this one day.

01:08:43.609 --> 01:08:46.678
Maybe if I just keep my nose
to the grindstone,

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.613
work hard.

01:08:48.615 --> 01:08:51.049
What do you think, Frank?
You think it'll happen for me?

01:08:51.051 --> 01:08:52.517
Are you gonna whimper
all night,

01:08:52.519 --> 01:08:54.417
or is there something
you want from me?

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:56.921
I hear you had a little bit of
a problem with one of my girls.

01:08:56.924 --> 01:08:59.024
She wasn't the girl
I called for.

01:08:59.026 --> 01:09:00.357
I called for Simone.

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:01.727
Yeah, well,
Simone was busy.

01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:03.694
Besides,
you scared the bitch.

01:09:03.697 --> 01:09:05.429
She's afraid of you, Frank.

01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:07.631
- She said that?
- What are you gonna do?

01:09:07.633 --> 01:09:10.533
Women, they're like feral cats.
They spook easy.

01:09:10.536 --> 01:09:12.938
That being said, there's a few
things you and me,

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:14.305
we need to square up here.

01:09:14.307 --> 01:09:16.506
First of all,

01:09:16.509 --> 01:09:19.676
you can't put your hands
on the lady unless you pay.

01:09:19.679 --> 01:09:20.911
No refunds, no exchanges.

01:09:20.912 --> 01:09:22.947
I didn't touch anyone,

01:09:22.948 --> 01:09:26.517
and if your employee says I did,
she's a liar.

01:09:26.519 --> 01:09:28.018
Now, why would she lie, Frank?

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.386
Uh, because she's a whore?

01:09:30.389 --> 01:09:32.423
I don't know.
You tell me.

01:09:32.425 --> 01:09:34.591
Well, that's not a very nice
thing to say now, is it?

01:09:34.594 --> 01:09:36.660
I'm afraid I'm all out
of niceness, Trip.

01:09:36.662 --> 01:09:38.828
Well, then, give me
what you owe me, and I will go.

01:09:38.831 --> 01:09:42.533
So that's 500 on top
of the $250 cancellation fee,

01:09:42.535 --> 01:09:44.868
just in case the bitch
forgot to mention that.

01:09:44.871 --> 01:09:46.370
But you know what?

01:09:46.372 --> 01:09:48.671
Because I actually
feel sorry for you,

01:09:48.674 --> 01:09:50.707
just give me a thousand
and we are good.

01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:52.943
She's not the girl I called for,
I'm not paying.

01:09:52.944 --> 01:09:55.613
Fuck, Frank!
Do not fuck with me right now!

01:09:55.615 --> 01:09:58.048
I do not need
some sort of fucking ordeal!

01:09:59.685 --> 01:10:01.085
All right, just take it easy.

01:10:01.087 --> 01:10:03.587
Hey, my behavior?
That is completely up to you.

01:10:03.589 --> 01:10:06.589
I have money for you
over here.

01:10:06.591 --> 01:10:08.659
I'm sorry things had to unfold
like this, Frank.

01:10:08.661 --> 01:10:11.128
I mean, you seem like
a real friendly guy and all.

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:14.497
Frank! Ah! Fuck!

01:10:14.499 --> 01:10:15.900
Shut up!

01:10:15.902 --> 01:10:18.836
- Shut her up!
- Bitch, shut the fuck up!

01:10:18.838 --> 01:10:20.537
Now, listen up, egghead.

01:10:20.539 --> 01:10:22.572
Unless you want your pimp brains

01:10:22.574 --> 01:10:24.607
splattered all over
that chewed-up mutt out there,

01:10:24.609 --> 01:10:26.643
I suggest you

01:10:26.645 --> 01:10:30.380
and your smirking little
Tic Tac, egg-shaped face

01:10:30.382 --> 01:10:32.916
get out of my sight,
or I'll put you to sleep.

01:10:32.918 --> 01:10:34.151
Does this sound like
a fair compromise?

01:10:34.153 --> 01:10:35.652
Yes.

01:10:35.654 --> 01:10:37.053
Okay, you're gonna
have to speak up.

01:10:37.055 --> 01:10:38.421
I'm... I'm very tired.

01:10:38.423 --> 01:10:40.023
Yes! Okay? Yes!

01:10:40.025 --> 01:10:41.424
And if you even think

01:10:41.426 --> 01:10:43.860
about coming back here
to see me,

01:10:43.862 --> 01:10:45.161
I'll kill you.

01:10:45.163 --> 01:10:47.463
And I'll find
everyone you love,

01:10:47.465 --> 01:10:48.965
and I'll kill them too.

01:10:48.967 --> 01:10:50.466
Do you understand?

01:10:50.468 --> 01:10:51.434
Yeah.

01:10:51.436 --> 01:10:52.569
Yeah.

01:10:52.571 --> 01:10:53.803
"Egg-cellent."

01:10:56.474 --> 01:10:58.643
Just go.
Go! Go! Go!

01:10:59.744 --> 01:11:01.680
- How you doing?
- I-I'm done, sir.

01:11:02.547 --> 01:11:04.080
Good.

01:11:04.082 --> 01:11:06.515
No, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:11:06.517 --> 01:11:08.417
Catch.

01:11:08.419 --> 01:11:10.755
- Thank you, sir!
- Yeah.

01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:27.636
Yeah?

01:11:27.638 --> 01:11:28.637
Dad?

01:11:28.639 --> 01:11:30.505
Joey, is that you?

01:11:30.507 --> 01:11:32.507
Dad, I'm scared.
I need your help.

01:11:32.509 --> 01:11:34.943
What? Joey?
Joey, I can't hear you.

01:11:34.945 --> 01:11:37.546
Are you still there?

01:11:37.548 --> 01:11:40.183
Joey, tell me where you are.
Hello?

01:11:56.133 --> 01:11:57.532
Joey?

01:12:01.672 --> 01:12:02.971
Joey?

01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:23.624
Joey? Joey?

01:12:23.626 --> 01:12:26.596
Hey! Hey.

01:12:28.498 --> 01:12:29.800
Joey?

01:12:32.202 --> 01:12:34.102
Joey!

01:12:38.976 --> 01:12:40.908
Joey?

01:12:43.713 --> 01:12:45.149
Come on!

01:13:01.597 --> 01:13:02.897
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

01:13:02.899 --> 01:13:05.132
Put your arm around me.
That's it. Up.

01:13:05.134 --> 01:13:06.836
Okay.

01:13:09.539 --> 01:13:11.674
Keep walking.
Come on.

01:13:29.092 --> 01:13:31.127
Is that warmer?

01:13:35.865 --> 01:13:37.564
It's not
what you're thinking.

01:13:37.566 --> 01:13:38.968
It's okay.

01:13:42.105 --> 01:13:46.906
I know it looks bad, but I've
got it all under control.

01:13:46.908 --> 01:13:48.777
You don't have to worry
about me.

01:13:50.346 --> 01:13:53.347
I don't have to
worry about you?

01:13:53.349 --> 01:13:54.647
That's all I do.

01:13:59.821 --> 01:14:01.290
I'm sorry, Daddy.

01:14:03.326 --> 01:14:04.626
I screwed up.

01:14:06.194 --> 01:14:08.262
It's all my fault.

01:14:08.264 --> 01:14:11.133
Don't do that to yourself.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.167
It's not your fault.

01:14:14.169 --> 01:14:17.839
It was never your fault.
It was me. It was my fault.

01:14:23.045 --> 01:14:26.813
We were starting to do okay,
me and you.

01:14:26.815 --> 01:14:28.348
We were...
We were getting there.

01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:30.150
And then Max comes along

01:14:30.152 --> 01:14:34.220
and tells me to take the rap
on something that he did,

01:14:34.222 --> 01:14:38.958
and his lawyer tells me
five, six years, tops.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.827
And even though
you just lost your mother,

01:14:40.829 --> 01:14:43.096
I stupidly, stupidly thought

01:14:43.098 --> 01:14:46.166
that $450,000
would make up for that.

01:14:46.168 --> 01:14:50.136
And six years without Dad...

01:14:50.138 --> 01:14:51.772
Idiot.

01:14:53.908 --> 01:14:55.175
And then they tell me,

01:14:55.177 --> 01:14:56.976
"Well, we're gonna
take care of Joey.

01:14:56.978 --> 01:14:59.345
We're gonna
look out for Joey.

01:14:59.347 --> 01:15:01.181
Six years.
He's all set."

01:15:01.183 --> 01:15:04.284
Six years,
and Joey's a rich man.

01:15:07.322 --> 01:15:09.890
Well, six years
turned into life.

01:15:13.661 --> 01:15:16.262
And what is it that they say?

01:15:16.264 --> 01:15:18.933
The road to hell is paved
with good intentions?

01:15:20.134 --> 01:15:21.602
Yeah.

01:15:24.004 --> 01:15:25.840
That's what they say.

01:15:42.756 --> 01:15:44.091
Thank you.

01:15:46.327 --> 01:15:48.129
Here you go.

01:15:49.396 --> 01:15:50.728
There.

01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:52.030
Careful.

01:15:52.032 --> 01:15:54.333
Probably bruised
a couple of your ribs.

01:15:54.335 --> 01:15:56.904
Might've even fractured one.
All right.

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.174
Looks good.

01:16:02.176 --> 01:16:05.112
And there's something else
I should probably tell you.

01:16:08.449 --> 01:16:11.085
I'm sick...

01:16:14.255 --> 01:16:16.488
...of seeing
that bacon there uneaten.

01:16:19.058 --> 01:16:21.225
- Mmm.
- Hey.

01:16:21.227 --> 01:16:22.361
So good.

01:16:22.363 --> 01:16:24.697
Mmm!

01:16:39.479 --> 01:16:41.512
Been so long
since I've been here,

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:43.316
I've forgotten where it is.

01:16:46.319 --> 01:16:49.022
Dad!
This way.

01:16:58.031 --> 01:16:59.899
It's beautiful out here,
isn't it?

01:17:04.137 --> 01:17:08.274
Damn.
This kid was only 15 years old.

01:17:16.249 --> 01:17:18.149
Lorrie...

01:17:20.253 --> 01:17:25.189
I'm sorry it took this long
to get here.

01:17:25.191 --> 01:17:28.193
I just want you to know
that we're okay.

01:17:29.329 --> 01:17:32.028
I love you.

01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:34.099
I'll be home soon.

01:17:55.887 --> 01:17:58.154
I just miss you,
that's all.

01:18:00.559 --> 01:18:02.225
I miss...
I miss you so much.

01:18:02.227 --> 01:18:04.094
I'm right here, Dad.
I'm... I'm right here.

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:05.829
- I know.
- Okay?

01:18:05.831 --> 01:18:10.166
It's just that Max promised me
they'd look out for you.

01:18:10.168 --> 01:18:13.069
H-He... He promised me.

01:18:13.071 --> 01:18:15.305
Dad, you knew what kind
of people they were.

01:18:15.307 --> 01:18:17.307
But... But I gave
my life to them.

01:18:17.309 --> 01:18:19.242
I gave them everything!

01:18:19.244 --> 01:18:21.944
And look... look what
they did to you!

01:18:23.348 --> 01:18:27.217
Remember what
they say about revenge?

01:18:27.219 --> 01:18:28.951
About having to dig
two graves?

01:18:33.090 --> 01:18:35.460
They're gonna have to dig
a lot more than two.

01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:48.003
You said you were doing
this all for me, right?

01:18:48.005 --> 01:18:50.607
- Yes.
- Well...

01:18:50.609 --> 01:18:52.943
Maybe you can do
something else for me instead.

01:18:53.645 --> 01:18:54.879
Walk away.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.447
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:18:58.449 --> 01:19:00.983
Today's your day
to try again.

01:19:00.985 --> 01:19:04.386
It's that simple.
You just walk away. Start over.

01:19:04.388 --> 01:19:06.355
Find some happiness
for yourself

01:19:06.357 --> 01:19:07.825
for however many days
you have left.

01:19:09.894 --> 01:19:12.863
- I don't deserve happiness.
- Yes, you do.

01:19:14.565 --> 01:19:16.532
So do what I ask.

01:19:16.534 --> 01:19:18.135
Promise me.

01:19:20.671 --> 01:19:22.373
I promise.

01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:46.186
Simone, hi.

01:20:46.188 --> 01:20:47.488
What are you doing here?

01:20:47.490 --> 01:20:49.024
I found your scarf.

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:53.193
I'm sorry to bother you
at your home.

01:20:53.195 --> 01:20:56.096
I was feeling
a fair amount of regret

01:20:56.098 --> 01:20:58.599
as to how our date
ended the other day.

01:20:58.601 --> 01:21:00.133
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:21:00.135 --> 01:21:03.437
And I should never have
thought or said

01:21:03.439 --> 01:21:04.541
that you and I...

01:21:05.742 --> 01:21:09.075
Well, anyway, I...
I crossed a line.

01:21:09.077 --> 01:21:10.279
I'm sorry.

01:21:11.447 --> 01:21:13.146
That's it.

01:21:13.148 --> 01:21:14.682
It's okay.

01:21:14.684 --> 01:21:16.483
And I have something
for you.

01:21:16.485 --> 01:21:18.585
These flowers?

01:21:18.587 --> 01:21:20.622
Yes. These.

01:21:21.657 --> 01:21:22.724
And that.

01:21:23.793 --> 01:21:25.459
What?
What's that?

01:21:25.461 --> 01:21:29.064
It's money.
There's over $100,000 in there.

01:21:34.636 --> 01:21:36.303
Holy shit!

01:21:36.305 --> 01:21:37.537
It's for you.

01:21:37.539 --> 01:21:38.538
And him.

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:41.341
Frank, I... I-I can't.

01:21:41.343 --> 01:21:43.410
Please.
I don't need it.

01:21:43.412 --> 01:21:45.278
I don't have anyone else
to give it to.

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:50.082
So please, just consider it
a-a thank-you

01:21:50.084 --> 01:21:53.455
for being kind
to a stupid old man.

01:21:55.657 --> 01:21:58.494
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

01:22:07.268 --> 01:22:09.070
Neither do I.

01:22:21.282 --> 01:22:23.449
Oh. Hey, bubba.

01:22:23.451 --> 01:22:25.819
Um, this is my friend, Frank.

01:22:25.821 --> 01:22:27.686
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:22:27.688 --> 01:22:29.758
What's your name?

01:22:31.158 --> 01:22:32.326
Joey.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.202
Of course.

01:22:43.838 --> 01:22:46.405
Bye, Joey.

01:22:46.407 --> 01:22:47.473
Bye, Simone.

01:22:47.475 --> 01:22:49.277
Jennifer.

01:23:42.262 --> 01:23:44.762
I'm so happy
that you're here.

01:23:44.764 --> 01:23:48.166
Poor Mr. Max, he doesn't
get hardly any visitors.

01:23:48.168 --> 01:23:50.234
Really only one
that I can think of

01:23:50.236 --> 01:23:53.237
in the last eight years.

01:23:53.239 --> 01:23:55.607
It's been much longer than that
since I've seen him.

01:23:55.609 --> 01:23:57.875
Well, I'll bet he'll be
real surprised you're here.

01:23:57.877 --> 01:24:00.113
Yes.
I bet he will.

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:10.155
Hi, Max.
Can we come in?

01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:20.263
Looking good today.

01:24:20.265 --> 01:24:23.235
Did you have a restful night?

01:24:24.336 --> 01:24:25.705
How long
has he been like this?

01:24:27.707 --> 01:24:29.174
Oh, you didn't know?

01:24:31.276 --> 01:24:33.212
About 15 years.

01:24:34.948 --> 01:24:37.616
I'm sorry you had
to find out this way.

01:24:38.985 --> 01:24:40.752
Max.

01:24:40.754 --> 01:24:42.954
Frank Carver is here.

01:24:42.956 --> 01:24:44.824
Frankie.

01:24:46.458 --> 01:24:48.425
Frankie.

01:24:48.427 --> 01:24:50.229
You remember him, right?

01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:53.597
Hey, Uncle.

01:24:53.599 --> 01:24:57.300
Been a long time.

01:24:57.302 --> 01:24:59.703
Well, I'll leave
you two alone.

01:24:59.705 --> 01:25:02.307
Let me know
if you need anything.

01:25:36.909 --> 01:25:38.944
19 years...

01:25:40.578 --> 01:25:41.880
...and I kept my mouth shut.

01:25:43.015 --> 01:25:47.017
I held up
my end of the bargain

01:25:47.019 --> 01:25:49.420
even though
I thought you didn't.

01:25:56.627 --> 01:25:58.897
But it turns out
you would've.

01:26:01.332 --> 01:26:03.766
Or I'd like to think
you would have.

01:26:03.768 --> 01:26:05.570
Either way...

01:26:06.838 --> 01:26:09.072
...I'm sorry

01:26:09.074 --> 01:26:11.008
I've been blaming you...

01:26:12.076 --> 01:26:13.809
...while you've been here...

01:26:15.012 --> 01:26:16.447
...like this.

01:26:21.786 --> 01:26:23.020
Bye, Max.

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.493
Excuse me.

01:26:30.495 --> 01:26:32.428
Can I ask you a question?

01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:33.796
Of course, Mr. Carver.

01:26:33.798 --> 01:26:36.799
You mentioned that
one visitor that Max had?

01:26:36.801 --> 01:26:40.035
Yeah, he came in regularly
for a good chunk of time there,

01:26:40.037 --> 01:26:42.571
but we haven't seen him
in a long while.

01:26:42.573 --> 01:26:44.405
Do you happen
to remember his name?

01:26:44.407 --> 01:26:46.909
No.
Sorry, I don't.

01:26:46.911 --> 01:26:48.944
He was
a real friendly guy, though.

01:26:48.946 --> 01:26:52.081
All of us just called him
by his first initial.

01:26:52.083 --> 01:26:54.351
Q.

01:27:11.102 --> 01:27:12.934
Hey, Frankie!

01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:14.838
Took you long enough
to find this place, huh?

01:27:16.373 --> 01:27:18.473
Are you checking in
or what?

01:27:18.475 --> 01:27:21.843
Hey, baby, I heard they have
really nice amenities in there.

01:27:21.845 --> 01:27:25.513
Water aerobics, bingo night.

01:27:25.515 --> 01:27:27.717
All the tapioca pudding
you can eat.

01:27:32.756 --> 01:27:35.056
I always liked you, Frankie!

01:27:35.058 --> 01:27:37.692
You always had
a good attitude about the job.

01:27:37.694 --> 01:27:39.594
If you were meant
to die that day,

01:27:39.596 --> 01:27:41.996
you were meant to die that day!

01:27:41.998 --> 01:27:43.832
But you know what?

01:27:43.834 --> 01:27:45.836
You are gonna die today!

01:28:00.482 --> 01:28:03.385
Well, Frankie,
I guess it's my day, huh?

01:28:07.756 --> 01:28:10.624
They won't be calling you
the Dragon anymore.

01:28:43.125 --> 01:28:45.125
Hey, Doris.
Good to see you.

01:28:45.127 --> 01:28:47.594
Hey, Cal. See you
on the dance floor, buddy.

01:28:47.596 --> 01:28:48.662
All right.

01:28:48.664 --> 01:28:49.897
Hey, you nervous?

01:28:49.899 --> 01:28:51.231
Guess what?
You're gonna be next.

01:28:51.233 --> 01:28:52.733
Let me straighten out
your tie.

01:28:52.735 --> 01:28:54.601
Go easy on the ladies
tonight, right?

01:28:54.603 --> 01:28:56.904
Make sure that, uh...
make sure you have fun.

01:29:00.475 --> 01:29:01.708
Hey, how are you?

01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:03.043
Good to see you.
I'm glad you're here.

01:29:03.045 --> 01:29:04.778
Hi, guys.
How are you?

01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:07.247
- <i>¿Carolina, cómo está?</i>
- <i>¿Bien, e tu?</i>

01:29:07.249 --> 01:29:09.883
Hey, listen, you owe me a dance
later, okay. All right?

01:29:09.885 --> 01:29:10.918
I will dance with you.

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:11.987
Hey, guys.

01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:17.592
How are you?
I'm glad you made it.

01:29:20.862 --> 01:29:22.595
Listen, man,
you bring my money?

01:29:22.597 --> 01:29:23.729
It's in the mail.

01:29:23.731 --> 01:29:25.198
All right.

01:29:28.703 --> 01:29:30.170
Hey, what happened?

01:29:30.172 --> 01:29:32.040
Hey, what's the matter?

01:29:37.545 --> 01:29:41.049
Isha, sweetheart, it's Dad.
Are you okay?

01:29:43.518 --> 01:29:44.717
Ish?

01:29:44.719 --> 01:29:46.688
Yes, I'm fine.

01:29:48.589 --> 01:29:50.458
Are you sure?

01:29:52.727 --> 01:29:54.629
You should come in.

01:29:57.598 --> 01:29:59.799
Baby?
What's the matter?

01:29:59.801 --> 01:30:02.036
Close the door.

01:30:03.104 --> 01:30:04.870
Frankie, what are you...
what are you doing?

01:30:04.872 --> 01:30:06.939
I said close the door.

01:30:06.941 --> 01:30:09.875
Please, not... not here, okay?
Not like this.

01:30:09.877 --> 01:30:12.144
Close the goddamn door.

01:30:12.146 --> 01:30:14.646
Okay, okay! Just... Just
let's... let's just calm down.

01:30:14.648 --> 01:30:17.083
I am calm.
Just do what I fucking say.

01:30:17.085 --> 01:30:18.951
Isha, are you all right,
sweetheart?

01:30:18.953 --> 01:30:20.585
Did he hurt you?

01:30:20.587 --> 01:30:22.522
Get out.

01:30:23.958 --> 01:30:26.058
It's okay. It's all right.
His beef is with me.

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:27.627
Beef?

01:30:28.695 --> 01:30:31.629
Beef?!

01:30:31.631 --> 01:30:34.033
You have my son killed,

01:30:34.035 --> 01:30:36.937
you lie straight to my face
about it...

01:30:38.106 --> 01:30:41.639
...and you think
I've got <i>beef</i> with you?

01:30:41.641 --> 01:30:42.674
I didn't mean...

01:30:42.676 --> 01:30:43.708
Isha...

01:30:45.779 --> 01:30:47.879
You think "beef"

01:30:47.881 --> 01:30:51.616
is an accurate description

01:30:51.618 --> 01:30:53.218
of what I've got
with your father?!

01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:55.086
Okay. Okay.

01:30:55.088 --> 01:30:56.087
I'm sorry.

01:30:56.089 --> 01:30:58.056
I misspoke.

01:30:58.058 --> 01:31:00.592
Did you really kill Joey?

01:31:00.594 --> 01:31:03.228
Yes, he did.
Now get out.

01:31:03.230 --> 01:31:05.063
- Why? So you can kill him?
- I said get out!

01:31:05.065 --> 01:31:05.966
Just go. Go.
Go, go.

01:31:07.934 --> 01:31:10.668
<i>Hey, Frank.
Frank...</i>

01:31:10.670 --> 01:31:12.771
<i>That looks serious.</i>

01:31:12.773 --> 01:31:14.873
<i>You've lost a lot of blood.</i>

01:31:14.875 --> 01:31:16.174
<i>Why don't we just...</i>

01:31:16.176 --> 01:31:17.776
<i>Hey, why don't we just...</i>

01:31:17.778 --> 01:31:19.377
<i>Why don't we just
put the gun down,</i>

01:31:19.379 --> 01:31:20.845
<i>and we can get you
to a doctor?</i>

01:31:20.847 --> 01:31:22.679
<i>All right?
Hey, Frank, Frank.</i>

01:31:22.681 --> 01:31:24.715
<i>Put the gun down.</i>

01:31:26.286 --> 01:31:28.053
Son of a bitch!

01:31:29.755 --> 01:31:32.991
So Max
falls in a coma,

01:31:32.993 --> 01:31:36.794
you take over,

01:31:36.796 --> 01:31:39.765
keep people thinking
it's still him?

01:31:40.766 --> 01:31:42.133
Yes.

01:31:42.135 --> 01:31:45.403
Well, how's murdering my son
fit into that?

01:31:45.405 --> 01:31:48.839
You think I wanted to do that?
Of course I didn't.

01:31:48.841 --> 01:31:52.142
I loved that kid,
and you know I did.

01:31:52.144 --> 01:31:53.879
But he was a liability.

01:31:57.216 --> 01:31:58.651
He was a junkie, Frank!

01:32:02.422 --> 01:32:04.788
<i>You guys, you're good?</i>

01:32:07.126 --> 01:32:08.859
<i>Why don't you wait around
the block, all right?</i>

01:32:08.861 --> 01:32:10.194
He wasn't that bad.

01:32:10.196 --> 01:32:12.329
Aw, come on!
Don't lie to yourself!

01:32:12.331 --> 01:32:13.966
He was a fucking dope fiend!

01:32:15.668 --> 01:32:19.103
He came all strung out,
demanding cash, drugs,

01:32:19.105 --> 01:32:21.071
threatening, if he didn't
get what he wanted,

01:32:21.073 --> 01:32:23.140
he was gonna go to the cops
and rat us all out.

01:32:23.142 --> 01:32:25.342
All of us!

01:32:25.344 --> 01:32:28.045
For everything!

01:32:28.047 --> 01:32:30.414
<i>We don't know. He's jonesing.
He's likely to say anything.</i>

01:32:30.416 --> 01:32:31.747
<i>He just said he would.</i>

01:32:31.749 --> 01:32:33.317
<i>We don't make decisions.</i>

01:32:33.319 --> 01:32:35.720
<i>We just got to do
what we're told.</i>

01:32:36.788 --> 01:32:38.623
So I had no choice.

01:32:40.926 --> 01:32:43.862
I did what I had to do
to take care of the business.

01:32:44.463 --> 01:32:46.296
And I know you understand that,

01:32:46.298 --> 01:32:47.797
because if you were me,

01:32:47.799 --> 01:32:50.867
you would've done
exactly the same thing.

01:32:50.869 --> 01:32:53.470
I mean, you went
to prison, right?

01:32:53.472 --> 01:32:56.806
You gave up
your whole fucking life

01:32:56.808 --> 01:32:58.743
for the business.

01:33:27.105 --> 01:33:30.740
You should've helped him.

01:33:30.742 --> 01:33:33.342
You were supposed to
look out for him!

01:33:33.344 --> 01:33:34.844
<i>You</i> should've
looked after him!

01:33:34.846 --> 01:33:37.148
You were his father.

01:33:38.816 --> 01:33:40.751
He was dead
the minute you left.

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:58.234
I'm sorry, Frank.

01:33:58.236 --> 01:34:01.504
If I could go back.
But I can't.

01:34:03.006 --> 01:34:06.944
So I just got to
try to live with it.

01:34:07.978 --> 01:34:09.913
And try to do better now.

01:34:32.135 --> 01:34:35.272
"Today is your day
to try again."

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:40.369
<i>Come out slowly
with your hands in the air!</i>

01:35:42.538 --> 01:35:44.307
<i>I said hands up!</i>

01:35:46.976 --> 01:35:49.111
<i>Stay where you are!</i>

01:35:50.513 --> 01:35:53.080
<i>Get down on the ground.</i>

01:35:53.082 --> 01:35:54.348
<i>Down on the ground!</i>

01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:56.150
<i>Right now!</i>

01:35:56.152 --> 01:35:59.053
<i>Not another step,
or we'll shoot!</i>

01:35:59.055 --> 01:36:02.022
<i>Now get down on the ground
with your hands on your head.</i>

01:36:02.024 --> 01:36:03.225
<i>Don't move!</i>

01:36:05.894 --> 01:36:08.431
<i>Gun! Gun!
He's got a gun!</i>

01:36:55.210 --> 01:36:57.610
Well, this situation
kind of sucks, doesn't it?

01:37:00.348 --> 01:37:02.615
So what are you
gonna do now?

01:37:02.617 --> 01:37:06.888
Ask God
to forgive me.

01:37:10.091 --> 01:37:12.994
Why are you still here?

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:15.161
I don't know.

01:37:15.163 --> 01:37:18.029
I thought we could
hang out a bit more.

01:37:18.031 --> 01:37:21.136
I'd like that.

01:38:12.354 --> 01:38:15.654
