Thank you, David.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.619
Good morning.
Lockhart, Deckler, Gussman, Lee,

03:12.620 --> 03:16.119
Lyman, Gilbert-Lurie, Kagan,
Tannebaum & Associates,

03:16.120 --> 03:18.419
how may I direct your call?

03:18.420 --> 03:20.709
I heard they fire half of us
in the first month.

03:20.710 --> 03:22.459
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I heard that, too.

03:22.460 --> 03:24.119
We should stick together.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.579
Uh, I'm Lili.
Maia.

03:26.580 --> 03:28.079
Uh, pretty ring.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.289
What is it?

03:29.290 --> 03:31.249
Oh, it's a rosary ring.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.459
Are you religious?

03:32.460 --> 03:34.289
No, no.

03:34.290 --> 03:35.539
Just nervous.

03:37.460 --> 03:38.580
Stand up!

03:40.290 --> 03:42.919
Those seats are for clients.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.039
Follow me and try to keep up.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.039
Lockhart, Deckler, Lee
is the result of a merger

03:49.040 --> 03:50.789
of three mid-sized firms.

03:50.790 --> 03:54.079
We are now the largest civil
litigator in the Midwest,

03:54.080 --> 03:56.119
and you are lucky to be here.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.419
As new associates,
you can be fired at any time,

03:58.420 --> 03:59.619
and many of you will be.

03:59.620 --> 04:01.499
Look at the person next to you.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.959
They are your competitor.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.039
Do better than them
or you're gone.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.289
This is not lawyer camp.

04:06.290 --> 04:07.959
We are not here
to help you learn.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.959
You are here to help us.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.499
If a partner needs
their dry-cleaning,

04:11.500 --> 04:13.459
treat it like a clerkship
for Justice Kennedy.

04:13.460 --> 04:14.670
Any questions?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.499
This is a depo dump.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.789
We need to know what
is in every one of these

04:21.790 --> 04:24.119
85,632 documents.

How are you doing, Maia?

04:41.500 --> 04:42.959
Good.

04:42.960 --> 04:47.619
No, no, no, here,
you take these.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.459
Say hello to your parents
for me, will you?

04:50.460 --> 04:52.039
Sure.

04:52.040 --> 04:55.459
Oh, by the way, this came

04:55.460 --> 04:58.459
Burl Ferrand.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.289

05:00.290 --> 05:01.919
MAIA <i>Mom.</i>

05:01.920 --> 05:04.289
Please don't send me
anything else, okay?

05:04.290 --> 05:07.039
Um, I appreciate it,
you know I do,

05:07.040 --> 05:10.039
but, uh, it's making me
look, um...

05:10.040 --> 05:11.539
I don't know, entitled.

05:11.540 --> 05:13.379
Are people not being
nice to you, dear?

05:13.380 --> 05:14.829
No, Mom, they're being great.

05:14.830 --> 05:16.209
It's the attention.

05:16.210 --> 05:18.879
You know, I want to just...
blend in.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.169
Do you want me to ask Diane
to put you in your own office?

05:21.170 --> 05:23.419
No, Mom, no, please, okay?

05:23.420 --> 05:24.669
Are you sure?

05:24.670 --> 05:26.039
Because we can call Diane.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.289
No. Everything is fine.

05:27.290 --> 05:28.829
All right, we to go.

05:28.830 --> 05:30.419
And, uh, I'll check in
with Diane later.

05:30.420 --> 05:32.289
No, Mom-Mom, it's okay.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.499
Love you, sweetheart.

05:36.330 --> 05:37.749
<i>Good morning.</i>

05:37.750 --> 05:39.419
Lockhart, Deckler,
Gussman, Lee, Lyman,

05:39.420 --> 05:40.709
Gilbert-Lurie, Kagan...

05:47.330 --> 05:49.579
Enough with the lilies.

05:49.580 --> 05:51.709
You know, some of us
have allergies.

05:51.710 --> 05:53.579
Oh, I'm actually
a new associate here.

05:53.580 --> 05:54.959
Good for you.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.380
Just go tell your head florist
no more lilies.

06:00.290 --> 06:01.620
Maia Rindell?

06:12.620 --> 06:14.329
Don't touch anything.

06:14.330 --> 06:18.789
And don't sit.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.669
Maia.

06:31.670 --> 06:32.959
How you doing?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.289
Good, good.

06:34.290 --> 06:37.329
Your first day as a lawyer.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.619
Your parents called.

06:38.620 --> 06:40.079
Oh, God, I told them not to.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.499
No, it's all right.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.829
They're worried you might
be being ostracized.

06:43.830 --> 06:45.289
Oh, they have got to stop.

06:45.290 --> 06:46.959
Really...
It's okay.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.499
There is an empty office
downstairs that I can...

06:48.500 --> 06:50.669
No, no, please.
Oh, come on,

06:50.670 --> 06:53.329
I-I don't want anything.
come on, let your godmother
spoil you a little bit.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.289
Diane, please.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.499
Okay.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.789
Oh, God, you've grown.

06:58.790 --> 06:59.999
Oh, really?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.919
Oh, I feel like I've shrunk.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.619
How's Amy?
Good, good.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.079
She's up for
a bureau chief position.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.709
I heard.

07:06.710 --> 07:08.170
Listen, I have
something for you.

07:12.290 --> 07:15.749
This was given to me
by Pearl Hart,

07:15.750 --> 07:19.539
the first female
public defender in Chicago.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.999
Now it's yours.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.709
Seriously?

07:22.710 --> 07:24.459
I'm retiring.
You're starting.

07:24.460 --> 07:26.539
It's fitting.
Like a baton.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.919
Now it's your turn to carry it.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.419
Oh, I haven't done anything yet.

07:30.420 --> 07:31.539
I hadn't, either.

07:31.540 --> 07:33.619
This will force you to, okay?

07:33.620 --> 07:35.919
Let's make the most of my two
weeks left of mentoring.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.669
Take notes on this deposition.

07:37.670 --> 07:39.749
Afterwards, I'll ask you
what you think we should offer

07:39.750 --> 07:41.209
as a settlement.

07:45.420 --> 07:48.039
Lucca.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.499
Ms. Lockhart.
Hello.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.169
I didn't know you joined
Reddick and Boseman.

07:52.170 --> 07:53.419
Four months ago.

07:53.420 --> 07:55.419
Oh. Alicia, too?

07:55.420 --> 07:57.579
No, just me.
Well, congratulations.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.329
Shall we get started
here, or do we...?

07:59.330 --> 08:02.209
Diane, sorry, I'm late.

08:02.210 --> 08:04.379
Judge Monroe stopped me
in the elevator.

08:04.380 --> 08:05.619
How is everyone?

08:05.620 --> 08:08.419
Diane, I feel so bad.

08:08.420 --> 08:10.289
I heard you're retiring.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.539
It's terrible you're gonna lose
your last case.

08:12.540 --> 08:14.919
Mr. Boseman,
how unexpected.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.289
So, which side am I on here?

08:17.290 --> 08:20.079
Eeny... meeny...

08:20.080 --> 08:23.789
miny...

08:23.790 --> 08:25.959
Okay.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.249
Someone help!

08:27.250 --> 08:28.789
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!

08:28.790 --> 08:30.079
- Ow, I'm sick!
- Leave him alone!

08:30.080 --> 08:31.249
I'm sick! Let me up!

08:31.250 --> 08:34.379
Let me up...

08:34.380 --> 08:36.458
You shot that video,
didn't you, Mr. Hunter?

08:36.460 --> 08:38.919
Yes.
Would you tell us
what you saw?

08:38.919 --> 08:42.039
I saw these cops
tackling Toby.
And that would be

08:42.039 --> 08:44.289
Mr. Toby Kendall,
the victim right here?

08:44.290 --> 08:46.039
Objection as to "victim."
Really, Diane?

08:46.040 --> 08:47.289
The gentleman's in a wheelchair;

08:47.290 --> 08:48.749
his parents have to feed him.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.119
Now what do you want
me to call him, um...

08:50.120 --> 08:51.619
"Happy participant"?

08:51.620 --> 08:52.959
"Arrestee" is good by me.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.539
No, you can preserve

08:54.540 --> 08:56.459
your objection for the record,
but that right there

08:56.460 --> 08:58.289
is no "arrestee."

09:05.380 --> 09:07.209
Stop! Stop!
Stop it!

09:07.210 --> 09:08.619
Stop!

09:08.620 --> 09:10.789
That kick to
Toby Kendall's head,

09:10.790 --> 09:12.789
that was completely
unprovoked, am I right?

09:12.790 --> 09:13.999
Yeah.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.879
Toby just lay there.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.499
All yours, Diane.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.879
You keep referring to
the plaintiff as "Toby."

09:18.880 --> 09:20.119
Do you know Toby?

09:20.120 --> 09:22.379
Are you friends?

09:22.380 --> 09:23.829
Should I ask Mr. Boseman

09:23.830 --> 09:25.619
if he wants to answer
that question?
Objection.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.459
Okay, let me ask you again.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.539
- Do you know Toby?
- He's a friend.

09:29.540 --> 09:30.619
And were you together
that night,

09:30.620 --> 09:32.379
trying to break into cars?

09:32.380 --> 09:34.669
We didn't break into anything.
Because you were caught...

09:34.670 --> 09:36.669
Objection. He's already
answered the question.

09:36.670 --> 09:37.959
Adrian, why don't you sit down.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.329
Because I'm too passionate.

09:39.330 --> 09:41.039
Oh, okay.

09:42.460 --> 09:44.209
Uh, Mr. Hunter,
this video.

09:44.210 --> 09:45.789
Adrian, would you
mind rewinding?

09:45.790 --> 09:47.829
Sure.
Thanks.

09:49.460 --> 09:50.879
Is this...

09:50.880 --> 09:51.959
the beginning of
the recording here?

09:51.960 --> 09:54.209
Yeah, What-what do you mean?

09:54.210 --> 09:56.119
This is where you turned on
your camera, right here?

09:56.120 --> 09:57.619
My cell phone, yeah.

09:57.620 --> 09:59.669
There was no other
footage before this moment?

09:59.670 --> 10:01.289
Diane, what do you have?

10:01.290 --> 10:02.459
Let's not sandbag here.

10:02.460 --> 10:03.669
Did you know that

10:03.670 --> 10:05.499
your video has metadata

10:05.500 --> 10:07.459
attached to it?

10:07.460 --> 10:10.669
Even if you try to erase it,
the metadata tells us that

10:10.670 --> 10:12.999
there is one minute
and 20 seconds missing

10:13.000 --> 10:14.789
from the head of it.
Objection!

10:14.790 --> 10:16.329
<i>Well?</i>

10:16.330 --> 10:18.619
$4 million.

10:18.620 --> 10:19.959
Why?

10:19.960 --> 10:21.169
The video.

10:21.170 --> 10:23.879
It's bad.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.789
We've been asked to keep the
settlement under $500,000.

10:26.790 --> 10:29.169
By...?
Cook County.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.289
They fired their last civil
law firm for being profligate.

10:32.290 --> 10:34.289
Oh, here they come.

10:34.290 --> 10:35.709
Just play the radical.

10:35.710 --> 10:37.789
Come on, I'm bad at it.

10:37.790 --> 10:39.289
Are you kidding?

10:39.290 --> 10:41.959
You scare me.
Not with Diane.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.289
- She'll know.
<i>- You are robbing the taxpayers!</i>

10:44.290 --> 10:47.289
No, Diane, no, you're implying
that this so-called missing

10:47.290 --> 10:48.959
video shows something nefarious.
I'm not saying anything

10:48.960 --> 10:51.289
other than what
the police report states.

10:51.290 --> 10:53.289
Come on, Diane, you know
you have to give up something.

10:53.290 --> 10:55.119
$140,000.
Oh, come on.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.879
Cook County will no longer
have a gun put to its head

10:57.880 --> 11:00.039
with these lawsuits.
Seriously... gun to its head?

11:00.040 --> 11:02.619
How nice to be able to talk
in metaphors when people like

11:02.620 --> 11:05.209
our clients have
a literal gun to their head.

11:05.210 --> 11:06.539
Look, Diane. I understand

11:06.540 --> 11:08.079
you want to impress
your new client

11:08.080 --> 11:10.539
with your toughness,
but look at the optics.

11:10.540 --> 11:12.379
You got three cops,
three white cops

11:12.380 --> 11:14.329
kicking the crap out
of this defenseless kid.

11:14.330 --> 11:16.079
Yes, this poor,
innocent car thief.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.749
So that's your strategy?
Blame the victim?

11:17.750 --> 11:19.459
No, this is our strategy.

11:19.460 --> 11:20.999
Your firm has personally
enriched itself

11:21.000 --> 11:22.499
to the tune of $180 million

11:22.500 --> 11:24.749
with these police
brutality cases.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.249
You are robbing
the tax dollars coming

11:26.250 --> 11:27.619
from the city's most vulnerable

11:27.620 --> 11:28.999
African-American
communities...

11:29.000 --> 11:31.210
Diane, when did you get
so cynical?

11:36.880 --> 11:39.619
You should be on this side
of the table.

11:39.620 --> 11:40.919
We're both using
this case, Lucca.

11:40.920 --> 11:42.289
Why don't you just stick
to the facts?

11:42.290 --> 11:43.619
Okay, all right.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.419
We'll come down to $4 million,

11:45.420 --> 11:46.619
but that's it.

11:46.620 --> 11:48.250
And I'll go up to $400 thousand.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.710
We'll see you tomorrow, Diane.

12:01.790 --> 12:03.169
Can I ask something?

12:03.170 --> 12:04.170
Sure, go ahead.

12:05.620 --> 12:09.079
Are we on the right side,
on this one?

12:12.460 --> 12:15.169
We are on a necessary side.

12:15.170 --> 12:18.789
People I thought
with all my heart were guilty,

12:18.790 --> 12:20.620
turned out to be innocent.

12:22.460 --> 12:25.619
And people I thought
were saints, they, um,

12:25.620 --> 12:27.249
they weren't.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.459
That's why you don't go
on instinct.

12:29.460 --> 12:31.829
You wait, you listen

12:31.830 --> 12:34.289
and watch.

12:34.290 --> 12:37.120
Eventually,
everyone reveals themself.

12:39.790 --> 12:41.119
Hey, we're pooling
our resources.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.169
You want to join?

12:42.170 --> 12:44.080
No, it's all right. Thanks.

12:45.830 --> 12:47.419
Where were you?

12:47.420 --> 12:49.419
I'm only a third of
the way through this.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.669
A partner just gave me
an assignment

12:50.670 --> 12:53.789
and I can pull
another associate onto it.

12:53.790 --> 12:55.619
You want to do it?

12:55.620 --> 12:57.579
Yes!
Yeah? Okay.

13:01.210 --> 13:02.379
Wait a second.

13:02.380 --> 13:04.459
Wait a second. It's a pose.

13:04.460 --> 13:06.879
That's all.
They will come up.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.619
We don't want to bury
too much time in this, Adrian.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.249
Barbara, look,

13:10.250 --> 13:12.579
Cook County, they're trying to
break our backs on this thing.

13:12.580 --> 13:15.709
We bend here, they'll use it
against us on the next suit.

13:15.710 --> 13:18.039
Lucca?

13:18.040 --> 13:19.999
You know Diane.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.499
Will she come up in her offer?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.499
I think Diane's got
something to prove

13:24.500 --> 13:25.959
- and she's out to prove it.
- So what?

13:25.960 --> 13:27.789
I have something to prove.

13:27.790 --> 13:29.039
We all have something to prove.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.579
She's retiring?
Yes.

13:30.580 --> 13:34.459
She wants to go out with a win.

13:34.460 --> 13:37.039
Let's get her up to a million,
and move on to the next.

13:37.040 --> 13:40.539
No, Barbara, she wants to cave.
I'm telling you.

13:40.540 --> 13:43.959
We'll talk when you get her
to a million.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.999
Lucca,

13:46.000 --> 13:47.419
where was the support?

13:47.420 --> 13:50.459
Huh?
I was asked a question,
that's all.

13:50.460 --> 13:52.999
Yeah, you don't think
I can take Diane down?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.039
No, I just think
I'm not helping. What is this?

13:56.040 --> 13:58.499
Ask for CFO Kendrick,
with the accent.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.919
Oh, come on.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.919
I'm getting held up
at the corporate level.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.709
She'll raise her tone.
Come on, help me out.

14:03.710 --> 14:04.789
Mr. Boseman, I...

14:04.790 --> 14:05.959
Yes, hello.

14:05.960 --> 14:10.459
Adrian Boseman,
calling for Mr. Kendrick.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.119
Well, he'd love to talk
to him now if he could.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.959
He's just popping out to lunch.

14:15.790 --> 14:18.079
Thank you.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.290
Okay.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.790
That was fantastic!

14:26.290 --> 14:29.209
After graduating
from law school with honors,

14:29.210 --> 14:31.379
Diane became an assistant
district attorney.

14:31.380 --> 14:32.959
She made her reputation
as someone

14:32.960 --> 14:34.919
who fought hard for the truth,

14:34.920 --> 14:36.879
and after five years,
she was recruited into...

14:36.880 --> 14:38.959
Oh, my God,
was I ever that young?

14:38.960 --> 14:41.959
I can't believe you're
leaving us, Diane.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.579
Oh, not in spirit.

14:43.580 --> 14:45.419
If you ever think
of coming back,

14:45.420 --> 14:47.959
you don't go
anywhere else first.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.249
I promise, Renee.

14:49.250 --> 14:50.539
Wait a minute...

14:50.540 --> 14:51.879
you promised me.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.209
Oh, Ethan.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.789
We have partners I'd throw out
the door to make room for you.

14:58.790 --> 15:01.079
Wow. Well, it's...
it's good to be wanted.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.209
Thank you for coming.

15:02.210 --> 15:03.999
Hi.
Lenore!

15:04.000 --> 15:06.459
Oh, look at you.
Wow, wow.

15:06.460 --> 15:07.959
Congrats.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.169
Maia tells us
what a great mentor you are.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.209
Oh, she's such a doll.
I love her.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.289
By the way, uh, Glenn's
been trying to reach you.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.879
We're running out of time
on the Provence house.

15:15.880 --> 15:16.999
Hmm.
Oh, my God,

15:17.000 --> 15:18.959
I am so jealous.
Provence!

15:18.960 --> 15:20.539
Yeah, but only if I
make the down payment.

15:20.540 --> 15:23.289
Well, yes, I wanted
to get my ducks in a row first.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.789
You know, your investments are
working so well for you, Diane,

15:25.790 --> 15:28.499
I was wondering if it's not
smarter to borrow the money,

15:28.500 --> 15:29.959
and leave it in the fund.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.329
Oh, well, let me
discuss it with Glenn.

15:32.330 --> 15:35.169
But, um, do give him a call,
he's not a bad guy,

15:35.170 --> 15:37.169
and he's feeling a bit ignored.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.379
Yeah, accountants tend
to feel ignored.

15:38.380 --> 15:39.959
Hello, darling.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.619
Oh, the power couple.

15:41.620 --> 15:42.999
Congratulations.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.959
So when are you two
getting married?

15:44.960 --> 15:46.499
Mom, no!

15:46.500 --> 15:49.120
Why? There's no
Supreme Court excuse anymore.

15:51.210 --> 15:52.619
Have you talked to your uncle?

15:52.620 --> 15:54.289
Who, Jax?
Mm.

15:54.290 --> 15:56.999
No.
He didn't talk to you
about the fund?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.959
No, why?

15:58.960 --> 16:00.619
Nothing, just you
two are so close.

16:00.620 --> 16:02.999
If he calls you and asks
you to talk to anyone,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.579
call me first, okay?

16:05.580 --> 16:07.329
What's going on, Dad?

16:07.330 --> 16:10.379
Nothing, you know Jax, he
tends to talk kind of wild.

16:10.380 --> 16:11.749
I don't want to
make everyone crazy.

16:11.750 --> 16:12.879
Okay.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.040
Good-night, honey.
Good-night.

16:16.460 --> 16:18.459
- This is so exciting.
- Lucca!

16:18.460 --> 16:20.749
Please give your name and
occupation for the record, sir.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.459
Andrew Theroux. CPD,
three years on duty.

16:23.460 --> 16:24.619
Is this you on the video, sir?

16:24.620 --> 16:26.539
Yeah, but that's
not the whole thing.

16:26.540 --> 16:28.289
You'll get a chance to explain.
What is that?

16:28.290 --> 16:29.959
My uniform.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.079
No, that...

16:31.080 --> 16:32.459
There.

16:32.460 --> 16:34.379
Oh. Uh, my bodycam.

16:34.380 --> 16:35.669
Your IP68.

16:35.670 --> 16:37.249
It was given
to all Cook County officers

16:37.250 --> 16:39.379
three years ago...
in order to prevent

16:39.380 --> 16:40.919
lawsuits exactly like this one.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.579
Is there a question here
or just a statement?

16:42.580 --> 16:44.669
So, Officer Theroux,

16:44.670 --> 16:47.919
where is your bodycam video
recording of this encounter?

16:47.920 --> 16:50.619
It, um, it wasn't turned on.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.329
I'm sorry, what?
You heard.

16:52.330 --> 16:53.999
In fact, there
were three of you there,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.579
and all three of your bodycams

16:56.580 --> 16:59.079
were turned off.
What?

16:59.080 --> 17:01.749
Do you see that
car in the background?

17:01.750 --> 17:03.789
My parents own one just like it.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.289
It's not the car
they were breaking into.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.959
I know, but, uh,
well, do you see

17:07.960 --> 17:09.919
the perimeter light on?
That's what happens

17:09.920 --> 17:11.118
when someone bumps it.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.329
It has four perimeter cameras,

17:13.329 --> 17:17.118
and they automatically record
and save to its hard drive.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.919
You're saying if we contact

17:18.920 --> 17:21.959
the owner of that car, they'll
have a video of this encounter?

17:21.960 --> 17:25.460
It's on its hard drive.
They can't erase it.

17:27.460 --> 17:29.619
Good work.

17:29.620 --> 17:33.120
Zoe, ask the investigator
to come up here.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.499
Good job!
Thanks.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.670
I like these daisies much
better than the lilies.

17:50.580 --> 17:53.419
Hey, what's up?

17:53.420 --> 17:55.619
What?

17:55.620 --> 17:57.079
They have a warrant.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.119
They're searching our apartment.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.209
They're asking if we have
a joint bank account.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.419
What? Why?
I don't know.

18:03.420 --> 18:04.749
They've impounded our computers

18:04.750 --> 18:05.959
and they're looking
for documents

18:05.960 --> 18:07.329
on your parents' business.

18:07.330 --> 18:09.289
I think it's about your dad.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.919
Check this out.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.789
Excuse me, gentlemen,
can you put that down please?

18:13.790 --> 18:16.079
Ma'am, we need you
to get off the phone.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.579
I'm an assistant
state's attorney, sir.

18:18.580 --> 18:20.419
I have the right
to use my cell phone.

18:20.420 --> 18:23.329
We'll discuss your rights
after you hang up your phone.

18:23.330 --> 18:26.580
Maia, I have to call you back.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.709
Dad, the FBI are searching
my apartment.

18:41.710 --> 18:43.959
They say it's about you.
What's going on?

18:43.960 --> 18:45.419
We couldn't hold him down.

18:45.420 --> 18:46.619
He was definitely
hopped-up on something.

18:46.620 --> 18:48.079
There's no way...

18:48.080 --> 18:50.379
So, you're saying
Mr. Kendall was high on PCP?

18:50.380 --> 18:51.999
Yes. He was crazed,

18:52.000 --> 18:53.669
grabbing for our guns.
How could you...

18:53.670 --> 18:55.249
Your accountant is on the line.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.499
Tell him I'll call him back.

18:56.500 --> 18:57.749
He says it's important.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.169
...are trained
to recognize.

18:59.170 --> 19:01.919
When we saw how he was acting...

19:14.250 --> 19:15.959
Dad!

19:15.960 --> 19:17.419
Oh, my God.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.749
Go see your mom.
It's okay.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.209
Oh, Dad.
Sweetheart, listen to me.

19:21.210 --> 19:22.709
Everything's gonna be fine,
I promise.

19:22.710 --> 19:24.079
I know.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.289
I love you.
I didn't do it, Maia.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.290
I know, I know!

19:32.620 --> 19:36.379
Glenn, what's going on?
Is it the house?

19:36.380 --> 19:39.039
No, what?

19:39.040 --> 19:41.039
When?

19:41.040 --> 19:44.789
I don't understand, I just...

19:44.790 --> 19:46.209
Many on Wall Street are asking,

19:46.210 --> 19:49.119
is Henry Rindell the new Madoff?

19:49.120 --> 19:50.959
Earlier today, the FBI shuttered

19:50.960 --> 19:52.789
the invitation-only
investment fund,

19:52.790 --> 19:55.959
calling it a multi-billion
dollar Ponzi scheme,

19:55.960 --> 19:57.289
whose collapse
has decimated the accounts

19:57.290 --> 19:59.119
of many of the nation's
liberal elites.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.789
Glenn, what about my...

20:00.790 --> 20:02.289
my retirement money?

20:02.290 --> 20:04.459
...range from $2 to $5 million.

20:04.460 --> 20:06.119
Fuck!

21:24.880 --> 21:26.379
This makes
the operation seem profitable

21:26.380 --> 21:28.959
and legitimate even though
no actual profit

21:28.960 --> 21:30.669
is being made. Meanwhile...

21:30.670 --> 21:33.209
You've been working out.
Yeah.

21:33.210 --> 21:35.119
With someone not me.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.169
You were busy.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.539
...with $8.3 billion in assets,

21:39.540 --> 21:42.119
it'll be the fourth largest
Ponzi scheme in America...

21:42.120 --> 21:43.379
I know her.

21:43.380 --> 21:45.959
Who, her?

21:45.960 --> 21:47.789
I hope you didn't have any
money wrapped up with them.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.380
My aunt did.

21:51.290 --> 21:54.289
God, I'd sure hate
to be her right now.

21:54.290 --> 21:56.539
Talk about the most
hated person in America.

21:56.540 --> 21:58.289
...Ponzi schemes are run

21:58.290 --> 21:59.669
by a central operator,
who uses the money

21:59.670 --> 22:01.209
from new incoming investors

22:01.210 --> 22:03.999
to pay off the promised returns
to older ones...

22:04.000 --> 22:05.459
...shuddered at the invitation

22:05.460 --> 22:07.289
of the investment fund,
calling it

22:07.290 --> 22:09.119
a multi-billion dollar
Ponzi scheme...

22:09.120 --> 22:10.289
Lenore?

22:10.290 --> 22:11.499
Rupert?
Hey!

22:11.500 --> 22:12.829
Did you see him?

22:12.830 --> 22:14.419
Yes, yes, yes.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.329
Henry is fine.

22:16.330 --> 22:18.579
Good, good.
Hey, Maia, Amy.

22:18.580 --> 22:20.289
I'm glad you're both here.
What's going on?

22:20.290 --> 22:21.829
Your dad needs your help.

22:21.830 --> 22:23.499
Your uncle Jax made
a deal with the feds.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.169
Oh, my God, he's a
monster. What's he saying?

22:25.170 --> 22:27.499
That Henry created
the Ponzi scheme.
Oh, my, oh...

22:27.500 --> 22:29.579
Jax claims he had
nothing to do it with it.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.539
He was just a fig
leaf for Henry's scam.

22:31.540 --> 22:34.419
Come on.
That is insane.
That doesn't even make sense.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.709
Jax traded stocks.

22:35.710 --> 22:37.789
We were just the ambassadors.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.169
That's why it's important
that we all agree

22:40.170 --> 22:42.209
on our understanding here.

22:42.210 --> 22:44.330
Starting with
you two... Maia?

22:47.080 --> 22:48.379
Maia?

22:48.380 --> 22:50.879
Yeah.
We need your help.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.749
You were on the board
of the foundation.

22:52.750 --> 22:54.669
Oh, my God, is he saying that
the foundation is part of this?

22:54.670 --> 22:56.039
No. He's saying the money
was parked there

22:56.040 --> 22:57.789
to hide it during audits.

22:57.790 --> 22:59.579
So, Maia, there
are signatures on each one

22:59.580 --> 23:01.169
of the money transfers.

23:01.170 --> 23:02.379
I need you to take
a look at them.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.749
Actually, we should go.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.789
What? No, no. Why?

23:05.790 --> 23:07.079
We shouldn't be here for this.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.669
Let's go.
What are you talking about?

23:08.670 --> 23:10.289
I just need Maia to
initial these documents.

23:10.290 --> 23:13.999
Rupert, you're Henry and
Lenore's lawyer, not Maia's.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.329
Well, I'm the
family lawyer.
That's not true.

23:16.330 --> 23:18.249
Why are you arguing with him?

23:18.250 --> 23:20.079
It is true. Maia.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.249
Dad needs your help.

23:22.250 --> 23:24.419
He's in trouble.

23:24.420 --> 23:26.290
Maia, just look
at these documents.

23:29.790 --> 23:33.669
Rupert, do we have
attorney/client privilege?

23:33.670 --> 23:37.119
Well, no, but we're covered
by your mom's privilege.

23:37.120 --> 23:39.959
Do we have attorney/client
privilege?

23:39.960 --> 23:42.119
No, but...

23:42.120 --> 23:44.170
You're not my lawyer, then.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.119
Mom, I love you.

23:52.120 --> 23:55.119
- Dad didn't do this.
- I know.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.669
I know.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.960
This will kill him.

24:01.830 --> 24:03.750
We won't let it.

24:12.540 --> 24:15.419
God, what does this mean?
Um...

24:15.420 --> 24:17.379
It means I basically
lost half my life.

24:17.380 --> 24:19.079
I don't have a retirement.

24:19.080 --> 24:22.039
My wife and I will have to work
until we drop dead.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.999
They should go to jail,
every single one of 'em.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.879
Even the daughter.
She had to know, too.

24:25.880 --> 24:29.789
I-I just worked 20 years
for no reason.

24:29.790 --> 24:31.789
My husband and I
will lose our house,

24:31.790 --> 24:33.619
our cars, everything.

24:33.620 --> 24:35.419
Our kids will have nothing.

24:35.420 --> 24:37.879
We've lost everything
that we've worked for.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.079
Almost everyone...

24:39.080 --> 24:40.539
That was hard.

24:40.540 --> 24:42.500
You did good.

24:44.210 --> 24:46.000
It's a nightmare.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.459
You're gonna need a lawyer.

24:50.460 --> 24:52.580
Diane?

24:54.170 --> 24:55.539
Yes?

24:55.540 --> 24:57.539
Are you hearing this?

24:57.540 --> 24:59.249
It's all gone?

24:59.250 --> 25:02.959
The Rindells have
13.8 million on hand,

25:02.960 --> 25:05.459
and that's from an initial
investment of eight billion.

25:05.460 --> 25:08.959
They never invested a cent?

25:08.960 --> 25:10.289
Not after 2008.

25:10.290 --> 25:12.119
The housing bubble.
There was a shortfall,

25:12.120 --> 25:13.749
and they made it up with
money from new investors.

25:13.750 --> 25:15.879
But I steered people to them.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.749
The Women's Fund,
all their money.

25:17.750 --> 25:20.709
I even told Emily's List
to put their 401k there.

25:20.710 --> 25:22.459
I know there's a lot
for you to process, Diane,

25:22.460 --> 25:24.539
but we need to think
about a few things

25:24.540 --> 25:25.919
and act fast.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.579
The escrow?
Yes.

25:28.580 --> 25:29.959
There will be a penalty,

25:29.960 --> 25:31.880
but we must get out of it now.

25:38.250 --> 25:39.250
Yes.

25:39.251 --> 25:41.879
Good.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.709
And you need to delay
your retirement.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.459
The government might
freeze your account

25:45.460 --> 25:47.079
and put you on
a living-wage budget.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.119
What? Why?

25:49.120 --> 25:50.419
Well, they can claw back
past earnings

25:50.420 --> 25:51.789
and distribute them
among all the victims.

25:51.790 --> 25:53.459
That's what they did
with Madoff.

25:53.460 --> 25:56.459
But my personal account,
that is my money, isn't it?

25:56.460 --> 25:57.959
No, not necessarily.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.119
They'll allow you to keep

25:59.120 --> 26:01.039
a subsistence-level
amount of cash,

26:01.040 --> 26:03.790
but they might freeze the rest.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.880
So am I broke?

26:10.290 --> 26:12.169
Well, I don't like
to talk that way,

26:12.170 --> 26:14.829
but you can't live
the way you've been living

26:14.830 --> 26:16.379
for more than a few months.

26:16.380 --> 26:17.789
You'll need to keep your job.

26:17.790 --> 26:20.620
Or maybe sublet this apartment.

26:26.290 --> 26:28.289
Is there a reason you
and your husband are

26:28.290 --> 26:29.709
delaying your divorce?

26:29.710 --> 26:31.039
What?

26:31.040 --> 26:33.379
You and your husband
are separated, right?

26:33.380 --> 26:36.289
Yes.
Well, if your separation
is permanent,

26:36.290 --> 26:38.289
then you really should consider

26:38.290 --> 26:39.879
memorializing with the divorce,

26:39.880 --> 26:43.669
otherwise, his accounts
could be frozen, too.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.289
This is a nightmare.

26:45.290 --> 26:48.379
Again, you need to act first.

26:48.380 --> 26:51.460
And the first thing is
to delay your retirement.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.619
This is not just about
my financial situation.

27:12.620 --> 27:16.039
I'm also afraid I would
miss practicing the law.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.499
I was in the midst
of the Kendall deposition,

27:18.500 --> 27:20.749
and I though, uh, my God,

27:20.750 --> 27:23.289
I love this...
this is what I do.

27:23.290 --> 27:24.829
So what do you propose?

27:24.830 --> 27:27.209
That I not leave.
That I close the case,

27:27.210 --> 27:29.829
and, um, that I stay on.

27:29.830 --> 27:31.830
In what position?

27:33.750 --> 27:37.169
This position.
My-my current position.

27:37.170 --> 27:39.669
You signed your exit agreement.

27:39.670 --> 27:43.249
Well, yes, but I would suggest
we rip that up for the moment.

27:43.250 --> 27:46.000
Unfortunately, I don't think
that works for us.

27:47.580 --> 27:49.119
Why not?

27:49.120 --> 27:51.959
Well, we're kind of
top-heavy, like you said.

27:51.960 --> 27:56.460
We already reorganized
around your leaving.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.999
This is my firm.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.459
No, it was your firm.

28:03.460 --> 28:05.499
Look, if you want to
stay on as an emeritus,

28:05.500 --> 28:06.619
we can discuss that.

28:06.620 --> 28:08.580
And lose my equity?

28:13.960 --> 28:16.670
What is to keep me from taking
my clients out the door with me?

28:18.250 --> 28:20.960
Where would you take them?

28:24.420 --> 28:27.579
I just brought Cook County and
their 32 million a year to you.

28:27.580 --> 28:30.920
Let's see how you feel
when you lose them.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.169
You're her, aren't you?

28:40.170 --> 28:41.579
No.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.419
You're a Rindell.

28:43.420 --> 28:45.959
I lost my retirement
because of you.
Excuse me, I have to...

28:45.960 --> 28:47.919
I know where you work,
you stupid bitch!

28:47.920 --> 28:49.959
You think this is over?
Ms. Rindell.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.669
I have nothing to do with...
No, I'm Yesha Mancini.

28:52.670 --> 28:55.419
I'm your lawyer.

28:55.420 --> 28:58.289
Good morning,
Lockhart, Deckler...

28:58.290 --> 28:59.290
How old are you?

28:59.291 --> 29:01.459
Does that matter?

29:01.460 --> 29:03.829
It can.

29:03.830 --> 29:05.249
Twenty-five.

29:05.250 --> 29:07.499
And you've been a lawyer for?

29:07.500 --> 29:09.209
Six months.

29:09.210 --> 29:11.000
Three months longer than me.

29:12.830 --> 29:15.459
Uh, you contacted my firm
asking for a lawyer.

29:15.460 --> 29:16.959
No, my girlfriend did.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.379
Your girlfriend
contacted my firm

29:18.380 --> 29:19.669
asking for a lawyer.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.579
Everyone else was busy, so...

29:21.580 --> 29:23.120
tag... I'm it.

29:25.830 --> 29:27.959
I-I think we need

29:27.960 --> 29:28.960
to talk about a few things...

29:28.961 --> 29:30.709
I got to get back.

29:30.710 --> 29:33.079
Uh, when the Feds call you
in for an interview...

29:33.080 --> 29:35.419
and they will...
call me.

29:35.420 --> 29:37.539
Here's my card.

29:37.540 --> 29:39.289
Actually, it's my firm's card.

29:39.290 --> 29:40.290
I just scratched out
my boss' name.

29:40.291 --> 29:41.789
That's mine right there.

29:41.790 --> 29:43.110
Doesn't really
instill confidence.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.670
I'll have cards
made up for next time.

29:52.580 --> 29:55.079
So, um, I was thinking about
what you said at the party.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.119
That you would have partners

29:57.120 --> 29:59.539
thrown out the door
to make room for me.

29:59.540 --> 30:02.919
Now, you're looking
for an emeritus position?

30:02.920 --> 30:06.959
Uh, no, a partnership.

30:06.960 --> 30:11.619
I mean, I'm not looking for
my name on the door, just...

30:11.620 --> 30:15.000
Well, let me talk
to my partners.

30:16.750 --> 30:20.539
So I was thinking about
what you said at my party,

30:20.540 --> 30:24.079
and I realized...
why am I leaving the law?

30:24.080 --> 30:26.249
We're not done breaking
the glass ceiling.

30:26.250 --> 30:30.079
You're not retiring?
No.

30:30.080 --> 30:33.789
But I am leaving my old firm.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.790
I was, um, hoping to join you.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.919
What's going on, Renee?

30:42.920 --> 30:44.119
What do you mean?

30:44.120 --> 30:45.749
I've been to three firms today.

30:45.750 --> 30:46.919
A month ago, they
would've been climbing

30:46.920 --> 30:47.999
all over themselves.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.499
It's a tough time, Diane.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.920
No, it's not.
That's bullshit!

30:52.460 --> 30:53.879
Do you want
a civil conversation?

30:53.880 --> 30:57.789
I want an honest
conversation with a friend.

30:57.790 --> 31:00.039
Diane, you're not
a spring chicken.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.119
Oh, so it's ageism,
with my book of clients?

31:02.120 --> 31:04.039
Call them, Diane.

31:04.040 --> 31:07.579
How many will actually
go with you?

31:07.580 --> 31:09.619
How many lost money
with the Rindells?

31:09.620 --> 31:11.329
I'm not the Rindells.

31:11.330 --> 31:14.209
You referred them to people.

31:14.210 --> 31:15.709
The Chicago Women's Fund?

31:15.710 --> 31:18.829
It's out $82 million.

31:18.830 --> 31:21.540
They may have to
close their doors.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.209
Just give it some time.

31:26.210 --> 31:28.879
It's a bad time right now.
You're poison.

31:28.880 --> 31:32.119
No firm will hire you.

31:32.120 --> 31:35.120
Just let it pass.

31:57.710 --> 32:00.459
You want a divorce?

32:00.460 --> 32:02.210
Your accountant called.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.959
Without a divorce, Kurt,
your finances will suffer

32:06.960 --> 32:08.209
from the same, uh...

32:08.210 --> 32:13.539
from the same... thing.

32:13.540 --> 32:16.040
It's about money, not about us.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.289
What do you want?

32:19.290 --> 32:21.249
No, this is...

32:21.250 --> 32:24.209
this is in your lap.

32:24.210 --> 32:25.959
I didn't leave you.

32:25.960 --> 32:28.379
Actually, you did.

32:28.380 --> 32:31.419
You slept with
your student, so...

32:31.420 --> 32:33.879
Okay, my accountant said

32:33.880 --> 32:37.079
that my bank account
will be frozen.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.249
A divorce will, uh,
save your account

32:40.250 --> 32:43.460
and just memorialize
what we're doing now.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.709
Which is?

32:47.710 --> 32:49.880
Living apart.

32:53.540 --> 32:54.880
How are you?

32:56.540 --> 32:58.119
I'm great.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.709
I'm broke and out of a job,

32:59.710 --> 33:03.039
but hey...

33:03.040 --> 33:05.879
bad things happen
to good people.

33:05.880 --> 33:08.040
You're out of a job?

33:10.710 --> 33:13.119
Yes, I signed my exit agreement,

33:13.120 --> 33:15.040
and they...

33:18.710 --> 33:21.000
...they won't...

33:23.710 --> 33:26.419
My God...

33:26.420 --> 33:28.329
this is my life.

33:28.330 --> 33:29.499
It's over.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.619
It's gone.

33:31.620 --> 33:34.120
I'm losing my apartment.

33:35.790 --> 33:38.379
I'm unemployable.
How is that possible?

33:38.380 --> 33:41.419
How is my life suddenly
so fucking meaningless?!

33:41.420 --> 33:44.419
It isn't.

33:44.420 --> 33:46.119
How can you work so hard

33:46.120 --> 33:47.539
every single day of your life

33:47.540 --> 33:49.119
and have nothing to show for it?

33:49.120 --> 33:50.459
Not a friend!

33:50.460 --> 33:51.920
I'm a friend.

33:53.620 --> 33:54.669
Kurt?

33:54.670 --> 33:58.119
I feel bad enough already.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.619
I don't want to be responsible

33:59.620 --> 34:01.789
for your going broke.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.750
Divorce me.

34:13.380 --> 34:15.539
Good morning,
Lockhart, Deckler...

34:19.210 --> 34:20.248
Diane.

34:20.250 --> 34:23.039
I am so sorry.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.498
Are you okay?

34:24.500 --> 34:27.000
That depends...
will I get my money back?

34:31.540 --> 34:33.208
I'm sorry, my
lawyer's directed me

34:33.210 --> 34:34.248
not to answer that.

34:34.250 --> 34:36.330
Then don't ask me.

34:39.880 --> 34:43.418
We may have a little
opening right here.

34:43.420 --> 34:45.918
Go for the jugular.

34:45.920 --> 34:48.579
Mr. Kendall, tell us
which car in the parking lot

34:48.580 --> 34:50.208
you were hoping to steal.
Objection!

34:50.210 --> 34:52.039
It is a completely
fair question.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.918
Not in evidence.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.208
Not close to being
in evidence.
Can I ask
my question, please?

34:56.210 --> 34:57.709
Sure, I'm just preserving my
objection for the record.

34:57.710 --> 34:58.999
Which car was it,
Mr. Kendall?

34:59.000 --> 35:01.079
Was it the sports car here?

35:01.080 --> 35:03.619
That's the one they found
with the window broken.

35:03.620 --> 35:05.120
Uh, I don't know.

35:07.210 --> 35:08.709
I-I don't remember.

35:08.710 --> 35:10.669
You don't remember which car
you were there to steal?

35:10.670 --> 35:12.619
Come on, Diane, is this
what you're left with,

35:12.620 --> 35:13.789
badgering someone
in a wheelchair?

35:13.790 --> 35:16.919
Excuse me, objection
as to badgering.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.249
I understand you're
not happy with your life,

35:18.250 --> 35:19.670
but don't take it out
on our client.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.790
Okay, we're done here.

35:37.540 --> 35:38.789
<i>There you are.</i>

35:38.790 --> 35:41.999
I want this firm to know
she stole my money.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.169
My kids are not going to college

35:44.170 --> 35:46.789
because she stole my savings.

35:46.790 --> 35:49.209
You can't get away!
I'm gonna sue you

35:49.210 --> 35:50.579
for every single cent!

35:50.580 --> 35:55.040
Then do it, but right now,
fuck off!

36:14.250 --> 36:17.580
When they see you cry,
it makes them happy.

36:19.210 --> 36:22.750
So get it
out of your system here.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.250
You're on the other side.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.919
I had a friend.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.669
Went through the same thing.

36:34.670 --> 36:36.880
Said it was hell
for a few months.

36:42.670 --> 36:45.539
Harden yourself.

36:45.540 --> 36:48.079
Ignore what people say.

36:48.080 --> 36:51.169
Keep your head down
and keep working.

36:51.170 --> 36:53.249
You're a new associate?

36:53.250 --> 36:55.919
Work is your friend.

36:55.920 --> 36:59.079
Don't watch TV, don't
look at the Internet.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.249
Do you have a book?

37:01.250 --> 37:03.079
Then read it.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.919
Keep it with you at all times.

37:04.920 --> 37:09.920
Don't give them the satisfaction
of making eye contact.

37:14.290 --> 37:18.500
It's hard... but it ends.

37:24.290 --> 37:27.579
That's the
video, Mrs. Lockhart.

37:27.580 --> 37:28.919
Excuse me?

37:28.920 --> 37:31.669
The car video.
The one you asked for.

37:31.670 --> 37:35.289
Oh, right.

37:35.290 --> 37:39.669
Oh, and, uh, Mr. Boseman
is here to see you.

37:39.670 --> 37:41.749
He... what?

37:41.750 --> 37:43.619
Did we have a negotiation?

37:43.620 --> 37:45.999
No.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.330
Okay, give me a minute.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.790
Hmm.

38:15.290 --> 38:16.499
Adrian.

38:16.500 --> 38:17.879
Hey.

38:17.880 --> 38:18.919
I didn't know we had a meeting.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.419
No, no, we didn't.

38:20.420 --> 38:21.960
Uh, we're not.

38:24.750 --> 38:25.960
I'm here to chat.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.169
How are you doing, Diane?

38:32.670 --> 38:34.959
Come on, sympathy doesn't
suit you, Adrian.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.169
What do you need?

38:36.170 --> 38:37.710
You.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.170
Me?

38:42.380 --> 38:46.619
I... want you to join our firm.

38:50.380 --> 38:53.169
You're broke, Diane.

38:53.170 --> 38:55.959
You're looking for
a place to land...

38:55.960 --> 38:57.329
and nobody wants you

38:57.330 --> 39:00.209
'cause of this Rindell scandal.

39:00.210 --> 39:01.789
I'm tired, Adrian.
I want to go home.

39:01.790 --> 39:03.539
You know, we're in the
midst of expanding.

39:03.540 --> 39:07.000
You could be...
our diversity hire.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.169
Well, if this is about the case,

39:16.170 --> 39:18.619
it doesn't make any difference.

39:18.620 --> 39:21.459
I mean, even if I joined you,
I can't use what I know.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.829
It's not about this case.

39:24.830 --> 39:27.169
It's about the next one,
and the next one,

39:27.170 --> 39:30.000
and the next one
and the next one.

39:32.170 --> 39:35.999
Diane...

39:36.000 --> 39:39.169
we don't want you to beat us.

39:39.170 --> 39:41.830
I would much rather
you help us beat them.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.499
I'd be a partner?

39:50.500 --> 39:54.460
Yes, and you'd be back
on the right side of things.

39:59.500 --> 40:02.999
Why aren't you afraid
of the Rindell scandal?

40:03.000 --> 40:05.829
I'm poison.
Haven't you heard?

40:05.830 --> 40:08.999
Yeah, here's the thing, Diane.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.459
The Rindells ran an
invitation-only investment fund,

40:13.460 --> 40:15.829
and you know what?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.170
They never invited black folk.

40:22.380 --> 40:25.169
You got fucked here, Diane.

40:25.170 --> 40:28.709
You know the best response?

40:28.710 --> 40:32.380
Come with me,
and you fuck them back.

40:41.210 --> 40:42.749
Explain it to me...
what did you do?
Okay, I...

40:42.750 --> 40:44.249
What did I...?

40:44.250 --> 40:45.579
I called an audible.
Ugh.

40:45.580 --> 40:46.999
It was an audible, Barbara!

40:47.000 --> 40:48.379
Don't act like
that's a thing here.

40:48.380 --> 40:50.579
You made a decision by fiat.
Mm-mm.

40:50.580 --> 40:53.039
You didn't care what the
rest of the partners thought.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.829
No, I saw an opportunity, Oh.

40:54.830 --> 40:56.669
and I thought it was
an opportunity that
What opportunity?

40:56.670 --> 40:58.539
we would all appreciate.
What opportunity?

40:58.540 --> 41:01.209
Diane Lockhart's firm
will be representing Cook County

41:01.210 --> 41:03.709
on every single one of their
police brutality cases

41:03.710 --> 41:05.249
from here until eternity!

41:05.250 --> 41:07.249
Now, at the very least,

41:07.250 --> 41:08.789
we just stole away their
strongest attorney.

41:08.790 --> 41:11.289
At the most, she helps
us with strategy.

41:11.290 --> 41:12.789
She can't tell us anything.

41:12.790 --> 41:14.539
Not on this case she can't,

41:14.540 --> 41:17.329
but on every other case
going forward she can.

41:17.330 --> 41:19.879
Barbara,

41:19.880 --> 41:21.959
are you worried about losing
the firm's culture

41:21.960 --> 41:23.919
or something? If that's
what you're worried about

41:23.920 --> 41:25.250
we can make sure...
Adrian, stop.

41:26.790 --> 41:28.829
You want to know what
I'm worried about?

41:28.830 --> 41:30.709
Yeah, yes, I do.

41:30.710 --> 41:31.999
Every rumor I hear
about Lockhart

41:32.000 --> 41:33.789
is that she doesn't
know her place.

41:33.790 --> 41:37.079
She's not gonna be happy
until she's in the inner circle.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.709
You're describing yourself,
Barbara.

41:38.710 --> 41:40.249
You're describing me.

41:40.250 --> 41:42.709
We're ambitious people,
and we need people like that

41:42.710 --> 41:44.459
around to grow
this company.
Lucca.

41:44.460 --> 41:47.669
Yes, but we don't want people
who are only happy

41:47.670 --> 41:49.789
when they're giving orders.

41:49.790 --> 41:52.169
Lucca, you worked
with Diane Lockhart?

41:52.170 --> 41:53.379
Yeah, for a year.

41:53.380 --> 41:54.789
This is not helpful, Barbara.

41:54.790 --> 41:56.039
Did you like working with her?

41:56.040 --> 41:57.419
I don't think it mattered.

41:57.420 --> 41:59.169
She was a partner;
I was an associate.

41:59.170 --> 42:01.919
Yes, and if she came here,
it would be the same thing.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.119
Would you like that here?

42:03.120 --> 42:04.789
Oh, God, Jesus.
God, help me.

42:04.790 --> 42:06.039
Since when is that
the criteria here?

42:06.040 --> 42:07.669
Lucca?

42:07.670 --> 42:10.880
Should we bring in Diane
as a partner?

42:14.460 --> 42:16.040
Yes.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.209
Why?

42:19.210 --> 42:20.879
She's a good lawyer.

42:20.880 --> 42:23.960
She's passionate,
idealistic and cunning.

42:27.880 --> 42:29.209
Anything else?

42:29.210 --> 42:30.709
No.

42:30.710 --> 42:33.539
She would be an asset.

42:33.540 --> 42:37.380
Thanks.

42:42.880 --> 42:46.879
Well...

42:46.880 --> 42:49.210
that went in a different
direction than I thought.

42:53.290 --> 42:55.539
She can't be a name partner.

42:55.540 --> 42:56.879
I didn't offer her that.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.499
Junior partner is fine.

42:58.500 --> 43:00.380
With an equal equity draw.

43:04.880 --> 43:08.120
Don't you ever
call an audible again.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.379
You got it.

43:14.040 --> 43:16.379
Oh, my God, they're saying
they have a sex tape of us.

43:16.380 --> 43:20.379
"TMZ, Exclusive footage:
Maia Rindell lesbian sex tape."

43:20.380 --> 43:21.959
Oh, God, don't look
at it. Just close it.

43:21.960 --> 43:24.209
Oh, my God, it's like waving
a red flag at a bull.

43:24.210 --> 43:25.919
Suddenly I'm a
lesbian temptress?!

43:25.920 --> 43:26.920
This isn't even us.

43:26.921 --> 43:28.249
This person has a tattoo.

43:28.250 --> 43:29.419
Okay, listen to me,

43:29.420 --> 43:30.789
you have to stay sane, okay?

43:30.790 --> 43:32.580
You have to ignore this stuff.

43:38.750 --> 43:41.580
Hi.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.379
Are you leaving?

43:44.380 --> 43:46.209
Yes.

43:46.210 --> 43:47.459
For where?

43:47.460 --> 43:49.790
Another firm.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.579
I don't want a divorce.

43:53.580 --> 43:56.709
Maybe it's smart, but
I, I don't want it.

43:56.710 --> 43:58.619
They'll freeze your account.

43:58.620 --> 43:59.789
Let them.

43:59.790 --> 44:01.749
Kurt, you're not a cowboy.

44:01.750 --> 44:04.709
We don't live in a world
with cowboys.

44:04.710 --> 44:08.120
I don't want the door
to close completely.

44:09.170 --> 44:11.380
It is closed between us.

44:13.380 --> 44:15.879
Then divorce me.

44:15.880 --> 44:18.290
But I won't do it.

44:23.750 --> 44:27.289
My parents saw the tape.

44:27.290 --> 44:29.290
They think it's us having sex.

44:31.670 --> 44:34.000
Tell them it's not.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.830
They don't believe me.

44:40.500 --> 44:42.419
I'm sorry.

44:57.420 --> 44:59.999
I'm leaving here, and going

45:00.000 --> 45:01.289
Oh, the bunch of schvartzes?

45:01.290 --> 45:02.539
You can't do that.

Yes, I can.

45:06.670 --> 45:08.379
I don't need to.

45:08.380 --> 45:10.039
Well, what about
the police brutality case

45:10.040 --> 45:11.379
you've been working on?

45:11.380 --> 45:13.209
I'm handing it off to you.
Ugh.

45:13.210 --> 45:14.709
Oh, and you may want
to look at this.

45:14.710 --> 45:16.999
The police were unprovoked.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.999
I could be wrong, but it looks
like a $6 million payout to me.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.709
Anyway, good-bye.

45:22.710 --> 45:24.500
It was fun.

Could you please stand up?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.039
Stand over there.

45:35.040 --> 45:37.579
Is there anything on this desk
