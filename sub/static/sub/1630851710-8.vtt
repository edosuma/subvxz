the victim.

25:26.834 --> 25:28.667
I've known you a long time.

25:28.667 --> 25:31.459
You've brought really sh--ty
dudes around, okay?

25:31.459 --> 25:33.417
I was concerned.

25:33.417 --> 25:35.459
You were my concern.
Your baby was my concern.

25:35.459 --> 25:38.626
That was it,
and I was a little confused

25:38.626 --> 25:42.375
that me bringing that up
would turn into

25:42.375 --> 25:45.000
you feeling the way
that you do about me.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.375
I thought for a second that
it wasn't completely genuine,

25:49.375 --> 25:50.584
and it was convenient timing.

25:50.584 --> 25:53.209
It's really hard to trust
what Lala says

25:53.209 --> 25:55.292
when I've been
the butt of the joke

25:55.292 --> 25:57.083
with her and her friends
for years now,

25:57.083 --> 26:01.626
so it's just this ----ed up
pattern of her hurting me

26:01.626 --> 26:04.000
and me forgiving her,
and I'm over it.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.334
I need to know
that you genuinely care

26:06.334 --> 26:08.626
and it's not just an act.

26:08.626 --> 26:12.417
I'm trying to make all
of these changes in my world

26:12.417 --> 26:14.501

affect people.

26:14.501 --> 26:16.209
So what do we now?

26:16.209 --> 26:18.000
Well, I would like
to move past it,

26:18.000 --> 26:19.459
because it's not
a good feeling.

26:19.459 --> 26:22.375
Okay, we're doing that.

26:22.375 --> 26:26.876
Can I give you a hug now?

26:26.876 --> 26:28.876
-I love you.
-[crying] I love you, too.

26:28.876 --> 26:31.709
I think Lala was trying
to come from a good place,

26:31.709 --> 26:34.209
but her delivery was sh--.

26:34.209 --> 26:36.292
Are you cool if I pull Brock
aside just for a sec?

26:36.292 --> 26:37.667
-Yeah.
-So that he knows I'm not...

26:37.667 --> 26:39.918
Yeah. No, I think
that would be good.

26:39.918 --> 26:42.667
And I think we can move forward
with a healthy

26:49.876 --> 26:51.501
Hey! Come on out.

26:51.501 --> 26:55.125
If I talk to Brock,
and you guys stay,

26:55.125 --> 26:57.292
can we make sure there's no
weighing in on the situation?

26:57.292 --> 26:58.667
It's just us had her.

26:58.667 --> 27:00.792
It's like asking the Pope
not to be Catholic.

27:00.792 --> 27:02.459
-Only when asked.
-All right.

27:02.459 --> 27:04.459

-Yeah.

I have never wanted
to come for you ever.

27:14.125 --> 27:18.125
And I just expressed a concern
that I think is very valid.

27:18.125 --> 27:20.584
That's not even the issue I have
about the situation.

27:20.584 --> 27:21.751
What is the issue that you have
with the situation?

27:21.751 --> 27:23.584
It's like
it's a backhanded apology.

27:23.584 --> 27:25.167
-Okay.
-So it's like,

27:25.167 --> 27:27.167

but expect it from me,

27:27.167 --> 27:29.375

popped off ever in your life?

27:48.667 --> 27:51.834
I have, but you come down
condescending to people.

27:51.834 --> 27:54.501

really ----ing old.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.417
Out of everyone in the world,
I'm going to pick
you...

41:46.417 --> 41:47.751
-It's not me.
-...to tell me how to be better?

41:47.751 --> 41:50.042
The only thing
growing on Sandoval

41:50.042 --> 41:53.751
is his heinous mustache

41:53.751 --> 41:56.250
that, like,
pre-pubescent little boys get.

41:56.250 --> 41:57.792
I'm just giving you simple math.

41:57.792 --> 41:59.584
This situation,
2 plus 2 equals 4.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.918
This situation, 2 plus 2
equals 4.

42:01.918 --> 42:03.626
This situation,
2 plus 2 equals 4.

42:03.626 --> 42:05.125
Okay, okay,
I gotta shut you down.

42:05.125 --> 42:08.083
I gotta shut you down.
I'm going insane.

42:08.083 --> 42:11.834
♪♪♪

42:11.834 --> 42:15.083
Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:15.083 --> 42:17.125
♪♪♪

42:17.125 --> 42:18.334
Whoo!

42:18.334 --> 42:20.626
-Should we join them?
-No.

42:20.626 --> 42:22.083
Who's this guy?

42:22.083 --> 42:23.751
Have you ever been to San Diego
or are you from San Diego?

42:23.751 --> 42:25.083
-No, I'm from Barstow--
-How you doing?

42:25.083 --> 42:26.375
-What's your name?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:26.375 --> 42:28.083
Lock him in the doghouse!

42:28.083 --> 42:29.751
Scheana, like, you don't just
stand there and laugh.

42:29.751 --> 42:31.918
You need to check in
and be there for your friends.

42:31.918 --> 42:36.834
Do you feel you are powerless
over weed?

42:36.834 --> 42:38.042
Yeah.

42:38.042 --> 42:40.042
This part of James
is screaming inside.

42:40.042 --> 42:41.167
-Yeah.
-It mutes it,

42:41.167 --> 42:43.083
but it doesn't make it go away.

42:43.083 --> 42:47.209
I literally felt like
I just sat there in silence

42:47.209 --> 42:49.042
while Lala and Katie were
just like, "Sandoval this,

42:49.042 --> 42:51.125
Sandoval that, Sandoval this,
Sandoval that."

42:51.125 --> 42:52.834
-This is not--This is not--
-Sandoval thinks that he

42:52.834 --> 42:55.209
can do whatever the [bleep] he--
-No, he does not.

42:55.209 --> 42:56.459
-I'm watching it.
-Just 'cause you say it

42:56.459 --> 42:58.000
doesn't make it true.
-I can't understand you.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
Oh, it's 'cause Sandoval's dick
is in your mouth. Sorry.
