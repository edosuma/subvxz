00:00.834 --> 00:03.026
<i>- Previously on Underground...
- What you doin' in here?</i>

00:03.045 --> 00:04.172
<i>She was sweepin' floors,</i>

00:04.206 --> 00:05.656
but she matched
the description of Harriet.

00:05.680 --> 00:06.615
Maybe you think

00:06.648 --> 00:08.150
this is your chance to escape.

00:08.183 --> 00:09.352
My boys.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.887
Not a day goes by I don't wonder

00:10.919 --> 00:12.787
<i>which one I let down more.</i>

00:12.820 --> 00:15.291
But I ain't sure I'm meant to lead.

00:15.323 --> 00:16.468
You put my baby in harm's way,

00:16.492 --> 00:17.894
<i>and you tricked me</i>

00:17.926 --> 00:19.603
into helping you do it.

00:20.062 --> 00:21.830
We're headed south.

00:21.864 --> 00:23.533
<i>You're dangerous,</i>

00:23.565 --> 00:26.009
and I can't have you staying
in my home anymore.

00:27.435 --> 00:28.435
Can I help you?

00:54.930 --> 00:56.933
State your purpose.

00:56.965 --> 00:59.234
My name is George Sterns.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.002
We have a friend in common.

01:01.035 --> 01:02.262
John Brown.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.873
I'm one of his secret six.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.355
You're a long way from home.

01:19.388 --> 01:21.791
It's God's honest truth.

01:21.823 --> 01:23.892
Captain selected me to make this trip

01:23.925 --> 01:25.460
with a message for your ears only.

01:26.069 --> 01:27.696
Well, my ears are listening.

01:27.730 --> 01:29.731
When last you spoke,
as the captain explained it,

01:30.449 --> 01:32.434
you found yourselves of common mind

01:32.467 --> 01:35.237
about the need for a larger scale event

01:35.270 --> 01:36.581
to move this country
in the right direction.

01:36.605 --> 01:39.040
What we spoke of is an act of war.

01:39.416 --> 01:41.209
The captain thinks he found it.

01:41.919 --> 01:45.047
There's a weapons arsenal
in Harpers Ferry, Virginia.

01:45.079 --> 01:47.315
Mr. Brown has intentions to take it,

01:47.348 --> 01:49.651
spread word to nearby plantations

01:49.684 --> 01:50.919
and use the weapons to arm...

01:50.952 --> 01:52.654
Arm the enslaved in the plantations

01:52.687 --> 01:55.290
up and down the seaboard
so they can be soldiers

01:55.323 --> 01:57.459
in the war that's been waged
against them.

02:00.195 --> 02:01.597
If done properly,

02:01.630 --> 02:03.499
it could spread like wildfire.

02:03.532 --> 02:05.267
He said you'd be of like mind.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.612
Of course, wildfire is hard to control.

02:09.863 --> 02:10.965
It's risky.

02:13.207 --> 02:14.776
But it's bold.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.582
Might be just what this country needs.

02:22.450 --> 02:24.820
Please tell Captain Brown I
appreciate his confidence.

02:26.220 --> 02:27.657
Yes, ma'am.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.759
He did have one other request
for you, ma'am.

02:32.461 --> 02:34.012
And what is that?

02:34.896 --> 02:36.965
He'd like for you
to be part of the raid.

02:45.339 --> 02:50.191
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

02:50.511 --> 02:51.913
Abolitionists.

02:55.845 --> 02:57.253
I heard massa using that word.

02:57.285 --> 02:59.721
I never knew what it meant,
but I knew he didn't like it.

03:00.989 --> 03:02.057
And he always use it

03:02.091 --> 03:03.793
when he was talkin' 'bout a slave

03:03.825 --> 03:05.419
that got into trouble.

03:06.662 --> 03:09.398
He'd say it was the fruits of abolition.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.205
Soon as I could read,

03:16.805 --> 03:18.107
it was the first word I sought.

03:25.689 --> 03:28.317
Could hardly believe
there were people out there...

03:29.693 --> 03:31.187
workin' to help us get free.

03:31.903 --> 03:33.657
Your eyes...

03:33.689 --> 03:36.158
Massa caught me teachin'
some other slaves to read.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.203
Had the overseer put lye on 'em.

03:42.297 --> 03:44.099
He thought it was a...

03:44.499 --> 03:46.403
poetic punishment.

03:46.752 --> 03:49.505
And you still found your way here.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.715
I didn't have a choice.

03:52.924 --> 03:54.968
'Bout to sell my family.

03:56.079 --> 03:57.079
We have to help him.

03:59.115 --> 04:00.391
Well, perhaps we could buy his family.

04:00.415 --> 04:01.617
And put money into the pocket

04:01.651 --> 04:03.219
of the man who burned his eyes out?

04:03.252 --> 04:05.088
- No.
- It's not ideal,

04:05.121 --> 04:06.564
but it's the safest thing
that we could do...

04:06.588 --> 04:08.538
The bill of sell done already gone out.

04:08.570 --> 04:09.926
The wagon comin' tomorrow mornin'.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.026
It's too late to buy 'em.

04:11.059 --> 04:13.129
Then we have to steal them. Tonight.

04:15.598 --> 04:16.990
How do we do this?

04:17.699 --> 04:19.384
The biggest problem gon' be the baby.

04:19.416 --> 04:22.205
Word of John Brown in the area
got them white folks scared.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.483
Massa gettin' more paranoid every day

04:24.507 --> 04:27.544
about runaways and revolt.

04:27.577 --> 04:29.746
That's why he's
sending everybody Deep South.

04:29.779 --> 04:31.481
To reduce the threat

04:31.513 --> 04:33.482
- without losing his property.
- And to make sure

04:33.515 --> 04:35.232
me and mine ain't run,

04:36.443 --> 04:39.179
he took to keepin' my son
in the big house.

04:41.223 --> 04:43.493
In his own room, he's sleepin' there.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.329
Now he want to send
my wife and daughter away.

04:51.608 --> 04:53.110
I don't know what to do.

04:53.944 --> 04:55.884
<i>- I need your help.
- This ain't like</i>

04:55.918 --> 04:57.916
goin' back to Macon.
We don't know this plantation.

04:57.940 --> 04:59.501
We don't know how many rollers they got,

04:59.525 --> 05:00.837
how many guns they got.

05:00.871 --> 05:01.911
We have guns, too.

05:01.943 --> 05:03.979
Look, I want to help him. I do.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.614
But there are only three of us.

05:05.647 --> 05:07.082
We can change that.

05:07.116 --> 05:08.652
If they're afraid of John Brown,

05:08.685 --> 05:10.186
let's show them that they should be.

05:10.219 --> 05:11.988
- Give them their revolt.
- Wh... No.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.689
You are talking about armed insurrection

05:13.722 --> 05:15.457
for one man and his family.

05:15.491 --> 05:17.536
If we ain't doing this
for a good man and his family,

05:17.560 --> 05:19.997
then who the hell are we doing it for?

05:25.234 --> 05:28.337
I've been thinking
about notoriety lately.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.707
What it means to be known
not just in your time,

05:30.739 --> 05:32.107
but years after.

05:32.140 --> 05:34.176
How one becomes a legend.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.348
Can't happen overnight,
it ain't just one act.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.957
You got to burn everything
that's useless,

05:39.981 --> 05:41.717
burn yourself clean, become one thing

05:41.750 --> 05:45.022
and amplify that into the only thing.

05:46.488 --> 05:48.524
The best slave-catcher that ever was.

05:54.496 --> 05:56.032
Harriet's a good start.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.368
But tonight will go down in history.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.737
Tonight I'm gonna make sure
the legend of Patty Cannon

06:01.770 --> 06:02.705
never dies.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.008
That the name echoes
throughout the years.

06:13.015 --> 06:14.183
Say it.

06:16.711 --> 06:17.981
I'm Patty Cannon.

07:08.671 --> 07:09.716
Who they for?

07:13.124 --> 07:14.710
My wife.

07:14.743 --> 07:16.645
And...

07:23.176 --> 07:24.787
and my slave.

07:30.291 --> 07:31.693
How did I let this happen?

07:53.515 --> 07:54.683
This will help.

07:59.555 --> 08:01.491
I know.

08:17.073 --> 08:18.241
Here...

08:23.746 --> 08:25.147
we can do it together.

10:07.650 --> 10:08.818
You okay?

10:13.756 --> 10:16.492
We ain't never gonna see
Momma again, are we?

10:16.525 --> 10:18.161
Why you say that?

10:18.910 --> 10:20.071
I was listening from
the top of the stairs

10:20.095 --> 10:21.397
when y'all talking,

10:21.430 --> 10:23.166
about that man,

10:23.199 --> 10:26.026
how hard it is to help his
family right across the river.

10:26.985 --> 10:28.637
We don't even know where Momma is.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.073
But we gonna see her again.

10:30.105 --> 10:31.698
How?

10:32.374 --> 10:35.243
I watched out that train window
like Noah told me.

10:35.994 --> 10:37.180
The world is too big.

10:37.213 --> 10:39.682
Ain't nothing too big for Momma.

10:40.165 --> 10:43.453
You know that part inside of you?

10:43.485 --> 10:46.621
That clever part that
gets you out of trouble

10:46.655 --> 10:49.092
and help you beat T.R. in games?

10:50.459 --> 10:53.463
Well, I got that in me.

10:53.928 --> 10:56.014
Sam had it in him, too.

10:56.799 --> 10:59.802
We smart. Tough.

11:00.310 --> 11:01.936
We fighters.

11:02.872 --> 11:06.175
And we ain't getting none
of that from Massa Tom.

11:06.691 --> 11:08.443
It come from Momma.

11:09.319 --> 11:11.681
She the smartest person I knows.

11:13.581 --> 11:16.018
She gonna find her way back to us.

11:30.932 --> 11:32.734
You feel that?

11:32.767 --> 11:34.369
He's kicking at me.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.406
He got a little bit
of Momma in him, too.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.683
He planning his escape...

11:42.043 --> 11:44.179
believe you me.

11:49.017 --> 11:52.721
<i>You sad, pretty thing.</i>

11:52.754 --> 11:55.357
<i>You ever think about another life?</i>

11:55.391 --> 11:57.026
<i>We can be free.</i>

11:57.059 --> 11:59.028
<i>I got to look after mine,</i>

11:59.061 --> 12:02.031
<i>do whatever I can
to protect my daughter.</i>

12:02.064 --> 12:04.367
<i>I know you understand that.</i>

12:04.400 --> 12:06.703
<i>What happened to Pa
ain't gonna happen to us.</i>

12:08.304 --> 12:10.406
<i>Your kin have sold you</i>

12:10.439 --> 12:13.376
<i>an old and terrible lie...</i>

12:13.408 --> 12:15.610
<i>that you can survive this.</i>

12:15.643 --> 12:17.647
Ernestine!

12:28.697 --> 12:30.525
<i>Out there, you got to make choices.</i>

12:30.559 --> 12:32.695
<i>And having your boy with you</i>

12:32.728 --> 12:35.531
<i>is going to change
the way you make them.</i>

12:35.564 --> 12:37.300
<i>I think we do have a choice.</i>

12:37.333 --> 12:40.303
<i>I think this one's just easier for you.</i>

12:45.440 --> 12:47.710
<i>Ben never should have been there.</i>

12:47.743 --> 12:49.645
<i>Didn't even want to be.</i>

12:49.677 --> 12:52.080
<i>Pa, Pa!</i>

12:52.113 --> 12:54.117
<i>I can't feel my legs.</i>

12:54.150 --> 12:56.786
<i>Inside each of us,
there's these two wolves.</i>

12:56.819 --> 13:00.089
<i>And we all fade to dust.</i>

13:03.025 --> 13:04.694
Ernestine!

13:44.133 --> 13:45.969
Am I seeing things?

13:47.518 --> 13:49.687
There ain't nothing to see.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.010
It's gone.

13:59.315 --> 14:01.184
What now?

14:56.805 --> 14:59.175
My father was weak.

14:59.208 --> 15:00.743
Everything he done

15:00.776 --> 15:02.777
was out of fear.

15:02.811 --> 15:07.282
And that's where you right,
I am like him.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.551
'Cause ever since I felt this baby,

15:09.585 --> 15:12.812
everything I've done
has been out of fear.

15:13.688 --> 15:16.758
But I couldn't let myself feel weak.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.594
Not before I had to be the strongest

15:18.627 --> 15:20.430
I've ever had to be in my life.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.636
And now that same fear
is screaming at me,

15:26.668 --> 15:29.137
telling me don't let you go.

15:29.171 --> 15:32.040
Make you stay. Keep you safe.

15:33.841 --> 15:36.377
I know that's selfish.

15:39.047 --> 15:41.466
But how do I let that fear go?

15:42.592 --> 15:44.020
You don't.

15:47.055 --> 15:50.141
You just can't let it
twist into something bad.

15:51.642 --> 15:54.964
That's how it wears you down,
makes you feel small,

15:54.997 --> 15:57.032
so you stop fighting.

16:10.612 --> 16:15.785
When I... when I thought
about my freedom dream,

16:15.817 --> 16:18.378
that house I was gonna build,

16:19.170 --> 16:21.589
it was about protecting you
and our children.

16:22.006 --> 16:23.825
To keep the world from hurting us.

16:25.393 --> 16:27.970
But now that this boy coming,
I see that...

16:28.464 --> 16:31.224
I see how small that dream was.

16:32.234 --> 16:34.436
He deserve everything, including a world

16:34.469 --> 16:36.705
that will see him how I will...

16:36.738 --> 16:41.878
special, important, free.

16:44.812 --> 16:48.116
And we cannot let the fear stop
us from making that happen now.

16:48.150 --> 16:50.920
We got to stay in this fight
till the end.

17:08.603 --> 17:10.571
I love you...

17:18.829 --> 17:21.184
It's not that I don't want
to forgive you.

17:22.951 --> 17:25.722
It's that I don't know if I can.

17:30.391 --> 17:31.960
That's all right.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.967
Right now, all you got to do
is just come back to us.

18:00.087 --> 18:02.291
One family is why we're here,

18:02.323 --> 18:03.767
but let's make it about all families,

18:03.791 --> 18:06.028
all the enslaved...
turn it into a moment.

18:06.061 --> 18:09.231
If they're so terrified that
Kentucky will bleed like Kansas,

18:09.263 --> 18:11.945
<i>let's break skin.</i>

18:11.977 --> 18:14.068
We've got five hours till sunup
to make 'em bleed.

18:14.101 --> 18:15.412
We've got three plantations to hit,

18:15.436 --> 18:17.039
and we got to hit 'em fast.

18:17.071 --> 18:18.706
Y'all hit the Proctor Plantation first.

18:18.740 --> 18:20.743
It's the closest.
Then you hit Hollinger.

18:20.775 --> 18:22.277
What do we know about each of them?

18:22.311 --> 18:24.146
Not much, but Daniel did say

18:24.178 --> 18:25.915
most of the paddy rollers are gone,

18:25.947 --> 18:27.715
due to the hiring out
of the field slaves.

18:27.749 --> 18:30.252
That's good. Less guns to contend with.

18:30.284 --> 18:33.088
But that also means you'll be
liberating mostly house slaves.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.182
<i>It's going to take some
convincing to get them to run.</i>

18:36.492 --> 18:38.469
I'm-a meet up with Daniel
at the Fellow Plantation.

18:38.493 --> 18:39.727
We gon' sneak that baby out.

18:39.761 --> 18:41.230
Then we gonna get his family,

18:41.262 --> 18:42.606
and then the house girls out,
too, if they willing.

18:42.630 --> 18:44.599
Remember, we are at war.

18:44.632 --> 18:46.734
And as such, we are entitled
to the the spoils of it.

18:46.768 --> 18:49.195
<i>Take whatever can help with the cause.</i>

18:50.004 --> 18:52.574
Three hours, that's all the time we got

18:52.608 --> 18:54.510
to get back over that river.

18:59.781 --> 19:01.617
You should take someone with you.

19:01.649 --> 19:04.853
No. We need this to be quiet
if we're gon' get this baby.

19:04.887 --> 19:06.688
And what if something goes wrong?

19:06.722 --> 19:08.657
Then one man ain't going to help.

19:11.493 --> 19:13.127
You gonna get your moment.

20:03.262 --> 20:04.847
What's going on?

20:04.879 --> 20:06.381
It's just me, massa.

20:06.415 --> 20:08.335
The mistress asked me to
put out all the candles.

20:10.818 --> 20:13.222
Get out before you wake that damn baby.

21:07.676 --> 21:09.144
It's five past. We need to move.

21:09.176 --> 21:11.629
Lucas is bringing out
the last of them now.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.583
Elliot, Elizabeth!

21:14.616 --> 21:15.984
What's wrong?

21:16.018 --> 21:17.886
Master got loose somehow.

21:18.219 --> 21:20.822
He has one of the house girls
hostage in his bedroom.

21:23.859 --> 21:26.095
Lucas got his gun out, but the massa

21:26.128 --> 21:27.896
got a fire poker to the girl's throat.

21:27.928 --> 21:29.063
I'm putting down the weapon.

21:29.097 --> 21:31.333
See? Let's just talk
this through like gentlemen.

21:31.366 --> 21:33.502
He's shaking scared.

21:33.534 --> 21:35.137
- Get out.
- That's what we plan to do.

21:35.169 --> 21:36.814
- He won't hurt her.
- Just give me the girl.

21:36.838 --> 21:37.940
Lucas can wear him down.

21:37.973 --> 21:39.356
You don't want to hurt her,

21:39.388 --> 21:40.642
you know you don't.

21:48.382 --> 21:50.284
Wait! If I give her to you,

21:50.318 --> 21:51.787
how do I know you won't harm me?

21:51.820 --> 21:53.321
If he was able to get loose,

21:53.355 --> 21:54.632
then someone from the Proctor plantation

21:54.656 --> 21:56.291
is bound to have by now as well.

21:56.323 --> 21:58.192
We need to go now if
we're gonna meet Noah

21:58.225 --> 21:59.661
and get back over that river alive.

21:59.695 --> 22:01.629
So what?

22:01.663 --> 22:03.632
We leave her behind?

22:03.665 --> 22:06.136
I just need to be sure
this young woman is safe.

22:06.168 --> 22:09.304
We got what we want, sir.
No one's gonna hurt you.

22:16.617 --> 22:17.786
Elizabeth.

22:22.583 --> 22:24.027
How about this card? What's his name?

22:24.051 --> 22:25.820
That's Thomas Garrett.

22:25.853 --> 22:28.890
By some accounts, he had seen
almost 3,000 runaways

22:28.924 --> 22:31.393
pass through his station
before he had to shut it down.

22:31.426 --> 22:33.995
3,000 people?

22:34.029 --> 22:36.595
That's a lot. Maybe that means...

22:42.603 --> 22:44.972
I know you have the Black Rose in there.

22:45.005 --> 22:47.875
Bring her out,
or we start with the killing.

22:47.908 --> 22:51.061
Everybody, back to your
rooms, and stay there!

22:59.955 --> 23:03.324
That's what happens
to anyone who tries to skin out.

23:03.358 --> 23:05.075
Help me block the door.

23:08.897 --> 23:11.599
Rosalee.

23:11.632 --> 23:13.542
We're waiting.

23:18.106 --> 23:20.041
Lock the windows.

23:34.790 --> 23:36.389
Head out the tunnel, then
down towards the river.

23:36.413 --> 23:38.375
- I'll hold them off as much as I can.
- Hold them off?

23:38.399 --> 23:39.433
You coming with us.

23:39.466 --> 23:41.139
No, I'm not.
I may not want to bring violence

23:41.163 --> 23:43.167
into someone else's house,
but I will be damned

23:43.200 --> 23:44.420
if they bring it into mine.

23:44.454 --> 23:46.068
James, stay here.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.003
Lock the door behind me.

23:53.340 --> 23:55.276
They're almost inside.

24:04.919 --> 24:05.887
Wait.

24:05.920 --> 24:07.522
Give me your hand.

24:09.624 --> 24:11.593
It's okay.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.503
- Why are we stop...?
- Shh.

24:28.810 --> 24:30.611
Go back!

24:36.984 --> 24:39.021
Get out through the tunnel!

24:46.127 --> 24:49.799
Through there. Lock it behind you.

25:06.313 --> 25:07.782
Get him in there!

25:08.984 --> 25:11.020
Come on!

25:25.000 --> 25:26.868
Put them guns down or you're dead!

25:27.769 --> 25:28.938
Put it down.

25:30.839 --> 25:33.891
You look like
you seen a ghost, house girl.

25:35.542 --> 25:36.511
Guess your man didn't tell you

25:36.543 --> 25:39.348
about our little reunion.

25:39.380 --> 25:40.748
Where he at?

25:42.684 --> 25:44.653
- The hell you doing here?
- A bit's happened

25:44.686 --> 25:47.022
- since y'all left me for dead.
- Push here.

25:47.054 --> 25:48.415
I made new friends.

25:49.156 --> 25:50.591
And Patty,

25:51.175 --> 25:53.996
she got an itch in her drawers
for Harriet Tubman.

25:54.029 --> 25:56.397
She seems to think you might be
the key to finding her.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.865
I ain't all that surprised

25:57.898 --> 25:59.538
that you turned out
to be a slave catcher.

25:59.567 --> 26:02.371
One thing you did do well,
sell out your own.

26:02.404 --> 26:05.674
See, that's where
you're wrong, house girl.

26:05.706 --> 26:08.944
I ain't never been a nigger.
I'm just Cato.

26:29.664 --> 26:31.599
They should've been back by now.

26:39.907 --> 26:41.827
You think we should cross
the river without them?

26:44.980 --> 26:46.381
Noah?

26:46.414 --> 26:48.083
Here they come.

26:48.116 --> 26:49.652
Let's get ready to move.

26:54.621 --> 26:57.291
- Whoa. What happened?
- Ran into some complications.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.736
The Kentucky militia are close behind

26:58.760 --> 27:00.171
and they're cutting off
our access to the river.

27:00.195 --> 27:01.730
And you led them here?

27:01.762 --> 27:02.840
We didn't have a choice;
We're outnumbered.

27:02.864 --> 27:04.008
Maybe we can sneak past them.

27:04.032 --> 27:05.634
Not with a baby and a blind man.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.468
Don't let me slow you down.

27:07.502 --> 27:08.845
You just get everyone you can out.

27:08.869 --> 27:10.104
Daniel.

27:11.372 --> 27:13.341
Ain't no one gonna slow down.

27:13.375 --> 27:15.344
'Cause we ain't running.

27:15.909 --> 27:17.678
We got guns.

27:17.712 --> 27:19.815
We've got folks with two
hands who can use them.

27:21.382 --> 27:23.417
All the road to freedom
is paved in blood,

27:23.451 --> 27:25.461
but ain't nobody said it got to be ours.

27:26.221 --> 27:28.690
This world we want is
not a place to run to.

27:28.723 --> 27:30.492
It's a place we change ourselves,

27:30.524 --> 27:33.661
with our choices,
the ones we make every day.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.830
And today...

27:38.465 --> 27:41.310
I choose to fight my way
back to my family.

27:55.382 --> 27:56.951
Noah will come back and help us.

27:56.984 --> 27:58.387
You right.

27:58.419 --> 28:01.121
In the meantime,
we're gonna hold our own.

28:01.990 --> 28:03.657
Open them drawers.

28:03.691 --> 28:06.261
Help me find anything
we can use as a weapon.

28:22.176 --> 28:23.744
How long can that door hold?

28:23.778 --> 28:25.881
Doesn't matter. I know where Harriet is.

28:28.165 --> 28:29.446
"Sunrise.

28:29.479 --> 28:31.386
The first angel's light
after the devil's grin."

28:31.418 --> 28:33.722
Is that some kind of code?

28:33.754 --> 28:35.724
- It's almost dawn.
- I'll round everyone up.

28:35.756 --> 28:37.725
No. Leave them.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.227
We need to ride fast.

28:40.077 --> 28:41.530
What do you say, Mr. Donahue?

28:41.562 --> 28:44.706
You want a firsthand account of
the capture of Harriet Tubman?

28:52.907 --> 28:56.211
Momma always said
lose yourself in the work.

28:56.243 --> 28:57.712
Remember when.

28:57.744 --> 28:59.246
Boo was being born?

28:59.280 --> 29:01.092
She kept me busy boiling towels
in the big house.

29:01.116 --> 29:02.192
- She ever have you do that?
- No.

29:02.216 --> 29:04.252
She didn't want me or T.R. near her

29:04.284 --> 29:06.120
when she was birthing babies.

29:06.154 --> 29:08.323
That's too bad.

29:10.390 --> 29:12.893
This baby been coming for some time.

29:12.926 --> 29:14.128
I'm gon' need your help.

29:14.162 --> 29:16.155
Come here. Here!

29:17.377 --> 29:18.470
Move this down.

29:50.631 --> 29:52.801
Over here!

30:02.976 --> 30:04.146
Get towel.

30:29.970 --> 30:31.472
Get back to the barn!

30:46.420 --> 30:47.588
Over there!

30:53.360 --> 30:54.662
Miss Elizabeth.

32:38.198 --> 32:39.967
This the place.

32:49.785 --> 32:51.479
You're not going to face her?

33:13.634 --> 33:15.603
There's nowhere for a hiding space.

33:15.636 --> 33:17.038
She ain't in here.

33:17.070 --> 33:19.174
You were wrong!

33:43.598 --> 33:47.300
The mistake Patty made
was believing in her own legend.

33:48.436 --> 33:50.438
Thinking she was invincible.

33:52.939 --> 33:55.016
It was a pretty good legend, though.

33:55.877 --> 33:58.478
One that shouldn't die just yet.

34:01.882 --> 34:02.816
What do you mean?

34:02.849 --> 34:04.886
I'm taking over the Patty Cannon gang.

34:04.918 --> 34:07.354
I'm Patty Cannon.

34:07.387 --> 34:10.091
I've already got a new Patty.

34:10.123 --> 34:12.260
And I've learned that having real power

34:12.292 --> 34:14.862
means you ain't got to flaunt it.

34:15.328 --> 34:18.665
How are you gonna get
the other men to follow you?

34:19.833 --> 34:20.934
I've been watching them,

34:20.967 --> 34:24.406
and truth is, most people
are slaves who need a massa,

34:24.438 --> 34:26.375
don't matter the color.

34:32.545 --> 34:35.306
And I'm about to give them
the biggest score yet.

34:36.725 --> 34:38.553
The Black Rose.

34:48.995 --> 34:50.464
Do you hear anything?

34:56.902 --> 34:58.339
Nothing.

35:15.342 --> 35:17.045
I got you.

35:23.664 --> 35:25.133
It's over.

35:28.301 --> 35:29.805
Thank you.

36:44.044 --> 36:47.615
Not so long ago,
I was where you is right now.

36:50.650 --> 36:54.054
When you realize
you been dying for a long time

36:54.088 --> 36:56.758
and just want it to stop.

37:01.361 --> 37:04.164
I tried to drown myself.

37:04.765 --> 37:06.535
But I was saved.

37:08.602 --> 37:11.129
I thought I was all alone,

37:12.672 --> 37:16.744
but someone reached a hand out
and showed me I wasn't.

37:21.014 --> 37:23.685
I don't know if I should
reach a hand out to you.

37:23.718 --> 37:25.853
I'm not sure you deserve to be saved.

37:25.885 --> 37:29.390
Things you done, blood on your hands.

37:31.858 --> 37:33.610
My daughter...

37:35.445 --> 37:37.265
she survived you.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.234
But how many others haven't?

37:42.285 --> 37:44.438
Time was, I would've sat here

37:44.788 --> 37:46.874
and watched you pull that trigger,

37:46.907 --> 37:49.243
or maybe even done it myself.

37:55.448 --> 38:00.303
But something in my heart
has shifted recently.

38:02.305 --> 38:04.892
And I'm glad for it.

38:05.350 --> 38:07.829
'Cause it's let me
start to forgive myself.

38:31.952 --> 38:37.058
We don't have to keep feeding
the darkest part of ourselves.

39:23.470 --> 39:24.939
Rose.

39:26.539 --> 39:28.408
- Rose?
- Georgia!

39:28.441 --> 39:29.644
Rose!

39:43.423 --> 39:45.258
No, no, no.

39:45.292 --> 39:48.429
Come on. Come on.

39:48.461 --> 39:50.097
Come here, boy.

39:50.131 --> 39:53.033
Come here.

39:53.066 --> 39:56.036
Where's Rose?

39:56.070 --> 39:57.604
It's over house girl.

39:59.640 --> 40:03.344
Come on out, or I'm gon'
shoot everyone in here.

40:03.843 --> 40:06.580
Starting with your friend Georgia.

40:07.055 --> 40:08.890
Climb up into that.

40:10.517 --> 40:12.769
Come on now, hurry up.

40:15.622 --> 40:17.425
Stick your arm out.

40:17.457 --> 40:19.793
Now, support his head.
His neck ain't strong enough

40:19.827 --> 40:21.696
to hold it up yet, you understand?

40:21.729 --> 40:23.263
Where you going?

40:28.092 --> 40:29.596
Tell Noah to find me.

40:41.816 --> 40:43.718
He took her.

40:43.751 --> 40:45.453
He took all of them.

40:55.996 --> 40:58.899
It's okay. It's okay.

41:02.124 --> 41:03.518
You free.

41:05.939 --> 41:07.841
You gon' be free.

41:10.211 --> 41:12.881
You gon' be free.

41:42.075 --> 41:44.344
You're awake.

41:44.378 --> 41:46.113
Good morning.

41:46.146 --> 41:47.849
Morning.

41:47.881 --> 41:50.150
It's chilly out there.

41:52.385 --> 41:56.189
Maybe you should just stay inside today.

41:58.091 --> 42:02.662
I'm tempted, but we're short
men at the armory today.

42:02.696 --> 42:04.498
I'll be missed.

42:04.530 --> 42:06.499
Yes.

42:06.533 --> 42:08.736
You will be missed.

42:14.341 --> 42:16.310
I'll see you tonight.
