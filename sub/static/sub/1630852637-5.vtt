WEBVTT

01:40.559 --> 01:41.977
Good morning!

01:42.060 --> 01:45.272
Look at you. Somebody found my dungarees.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.816
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.277
I told you,
anything in the attic is fair game.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.988
Does this mean what I think it does?
You're gonna come today?

01:54.740 --> 01:56.033
Did you hear?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.911
-Leanne's gonna come to the festival.
-That's good, Leanne.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.079
It's a big step,
being around so many new people.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.164
Think I'm ready.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.250
Well, it's a gorgeous day,
and we'll all be right there with you.

02:05.334 --> 02:09.213
-Look at that. Termite droppings.
-Looks like black pepper.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.548
No, it's not. I looked up pictures.
It's termite droppings.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.968
It's in the spice rack.
We need an exterminator to blast it out.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.053
Sean's right.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.305
I recognize it. It's called frass.

02:18.388 --> 02:21.683
Well, the house has been here
for 175 years, as we all know.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.269
So I don't think
it's going to fall apart today.

02:24.353 --> 02:28.190
Can I show you something, please?
You're gonna be right here, 3-B.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.525
By the bounce house?

02:29.608 --> 02:31.443
Space is tight.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.904
I'll have a thousand kids
screaming in my ear all day.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.448
Right. It's a block party, darling.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.367
What's with all the shitty food trucks?

02:41.078 --> 02:43.622
-What the fuck is that?
-Liquid nitrogen.

02:44.122 --> 02:47.251
Of course, a dangerous chemical
in the kitchen. My apologies.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.212
Can we get that out of here, please?

02:50.295 --> 02:53.841
Sean has a big surprise planned
for the block party.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.050
Sounds ominous.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.969
Where's Veera?

02:57.052 --> 02:59.221
She couldn't make it.
Some last-minute work thing.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.306
So, I figured I'd come by.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.892
Get my steps in. Support my big sis.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.853
You're here for the funnel cakes,
aren't you?

03:05.936 --> 03:08.981
You used to love those.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.108
-Maybe a little too much.
-Get off.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.068
Have you seen the park?

03:13.151 --> 03:15.320
-Them?
-What, the homeless kids?

03:15.404 --> 03:18.073
-There's more of them now. A lot more.
-They're just passing through.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.200
Yeah, and you're giving them
gourmet handouts!

03:20.284 --> 03:23.161
This is how it starts. Before you know it,
you'll be up to your ass in squatters,

03:23.245 --> 03:25.080
and the house will be worth
pennies on the dollar.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.666
Okay, I don't wanna think about
any of this today.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.502
-Is that what you're wearing?
-Julian!

03:31.587 --> 03:33.213
How are you feeling?

03:33.755 --> 03:36.592
Fine. I just really want everything
to go smoothly.

03:36.675 --> 03:39.011
There are so many moving parts
in an event like this.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.890
People just wanna get outside.
They're not expecting fucking Disneyland.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.516
Shall we?

03:45.934 --> 03:47.144
Leanne? You coming?

04:11.043 --> 04:13.337
Leanne! Hey, come here!

04:14.421 --> 04:15.964
Here. Excuse me.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.767
VoilÃ . We have ice cream.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.855
My husband. He's such a showman.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.941
I'm gonna serve it
over a miniature French toast

04:34.024 --> 04:36.193
with a dehydrated maple and pancetta.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.071
-Chef Tobe is gonna put it in your mouth.
-Come on, you two. I'll show you around.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.989
If we can form an orderly line?

04:42.074 --> 04:45.827
So, here's the ax-throwing booth.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.830
It's a tad expensive,
but people go crazy for it.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.626
And this is where we're doing folk dance.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.838
Here's the barbecue tent.
They come all the way from Bucks County.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.549
It's supposed to be phenomenal.
You have to try it.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.716
And we've--

05:03.220 --> 05:04.263
What's the matter?

05:05.389 --> 05:07.307
Those bastards.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.184
They sent her?

05:11.395 --> 05:13.146
Dorothy, I'm sure it's nothing personal.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.606
Of course it's personal.

05:14.690 --> 05:18.235
I pitched this block party story
to them weeks ago.

05:18.735 --> 05:22.573
This network thinks they can ice me out,
I'm just gonna walk away quietly.

05:24.575 --> 05:25.576
You know what?

05:26.285 --> 05:27.286
Here.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.705
Come to mama. Come on.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.290
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

05:31.373 --> 05:34.334
Little Jericho's about to have
his big television debut.

05:34.418 --> 05:37.379
-Dottie, what the hell are you doing?
-I am a working mother in television.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.048
I fought tooth and nail
to be where I am today.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.135
And I will not be replaced
by this amateur.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.636
Fuck 'em. I'm going on camera.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.306
-Please think this through.
-I have.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.601
Now is the time to seize the narrative,
not get steamrolled by it.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.811
And what about him?
And what if Aunt May sees?

05:52.895 --> 05:54.813
That woman watches the news
like a goddamn hawk.

05:54.897 --> 05:57.357
I will not pretend my son does not exist.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.362
Dorothy, hey!

06:02.446 --> 06:04.072
Isabelle, darling.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.700
You look so fun.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.703
Well, official organizer apparel.

06:09.786 --> 06:13.624
Speaking of which, I figured you'd wanna
have a statement from me for your segment.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.046
I mean-- Yeah, of course.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.131
-We're just doing a little feature, but--
-Great.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.133
Carlos, I think we should frame up
in the middle

06:23.217 --> 06:25.427
so we have more visual interest.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.847
Okay, we're gonna have to get
some B-roll of Sean.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.184
Puppet show starts in five,
which I think would be great.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.436
I'm gonna go talk to Sean.
You all right here?

06:35.437 --> 06:36.563
Yeah.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.489
You are gonna love this.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.990
-Thanks, man.
-Sure.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.244
-Hey.
-How's Leanne?

06:50.327 --> 06:51.954
-With Dorothy.
-Dude, there's a line.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.830
And I'm not in it, asshole.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.749
She went on camera.
I couldn't talk her out of it.

06:55.832 --> 06:56.834
That's good, right?

06:56.917 --> 06:59.419
Good? Have you seen the fucking memes?

06:59.503 --> 07:01.547
-What, the cow thing?
-Yeah. Moo.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.382
I'm sure Dorothy can handle
a couple of Twitter trolls.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.550
No, you're not hearing me.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.552
She took Jericho and thrust him
in front of a camera.

07:06.635 --> 07:07.970
You need to back off.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.137
What?

07:09.221 --> 07:10.806
That whole stunt you pulled with the DNA.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.183
You nearly jeopardized everything.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.310
-I'm just trying to fix this.
-Julian.

07:15.394 --> 07:18.230
If you wanna help, go have fun.
Enjoy the day.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.315
Dorothy put a lot of effort into it.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.860
How is it so goddamn hot?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.486
Have some ice cream.

07:24.570 --> 07:25.571
Sean.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.990
Nancy. Wow, hey!

07:28.073 --> 07:30.367
You're really holding out on us
at coffee hour.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.744
Where's Mrs. Turner?

07:32.828 --> 07:35.747
She's really busy. She kinda headed up
this whole thing. So, uh--

07:35.831 --> 07:37.291
-Of course. Busy woman.
-Yeah.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.294
-I would love to introduce you soon.
-I'd really like that.

07:40.377 --> 07:43.172
-You want a portion?
-No dairy for me.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.048
Right.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.301
I was just in the area.
Figured I'd say hello.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.802
Okay, great to see you again.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.012
See you next week.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.096
Chef, the gloves.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.514
I knew it.

07:53.098 --> 07:56.101
-She's a friend of mine.
-That was no friend.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.644
"Coffee hour?"

07:57.728 --> 08:00.731
What is it, grief counseling?
Some kind of group session?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.482
-Is it AA?
-No, it's nothing like that.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.109
She's a-- a minister.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.028
Oh, God. How long?

08:06.528 --> 08:08.530
Couple months.
But it's helping me. It's really good.

08:08.614 --> 08:09.990
I'm so happy for you.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.909
-Does Dorothy know?
-Not yet.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.119
Yeah, best keep it that way.

08:15.579 --> 08:18.707
Well, this explains a lot.
I liked you better when you were godless.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.918
Yeah, I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

08:22.211 --> 08:27.799
We're out here at Spring on Spruce
with an amazing acrobatics troop I found.

08:27.883 --> 08:31.261
The Gods Punish Wildly are Philly natives.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.057
Are you okay?

08:38.227 --> 08:39.645
They bothering you, honey?

08:40.729 --> 08:42.188
It's that feed-the-homeless chef.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.316
I mean, I think what he does is wonderful,

08:44.399 --> 08:46.443
but at a certain point,
you need to draw the line.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.362
This is a family event.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.280
Do you think you could ask them to leave?

08:51.114 --> 08:52.824
I can do a whole lot better than that.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.661
Yo, did you guys pay for this?

08:55.744 --> 08:58.372
You know you have to pay
to participate in the block party.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.748
You pay? No?

08:59.831 --> 09:02.251
Let's go. You need to go. Now.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.713
You have to go all the way
to the end of the block to exit the area.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.967
Block party.
You have to pay to participate.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.094
Come on. Let's go.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.416
Thank you. You are good to go.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.169
What would you like?

09:45.669 --> 09:46.920
A tiger, please.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.213
You got it.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.340
Go ahead and take a seat.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.306
I love your overalls.

09:58.473 --> 09:59.683
Thank you.

10:00.559 --> 10:03.395
My mother gave them to me.
They used to be hers.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.730
Well, that's sweet.

10:04.813 --> 10:08.442
The only thing my mom gave me
was her crippling anxiety.

10:09.735 --> 10:12.905
Just keep your face relaxed. That's good.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.506
Do you still speak to your mother?

10:45.103 --> 10:46.522
Sorry.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.733
I just had to step away for a second.
What were you saying?

10:53.237 --> 10:57.574
-Nothing.
-Well, just keep your face relaxed.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.285
We're almost done.

11:05.249 --> 11:06.458
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

11:27.271 --> 11:28.814
Zoe!

11:41.326 --> 11:44.413
People only wanna present
the good things in their lives.

11:44.496 --> 11:48.166
Don't get me wrong, she's been
a godsend for this year's block party.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.501
The good things?

11:50.002 --> 11:52.921
She and her husband
look like such a happy couple, but--

11:53.422 --> 11:55.382
I shouldn't blab.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.009
Come on. I won't tell.

11:57.801 --> 12:02.806
All I'll say is I saw an ambulance
outside their house once.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.392
And police cars at least twice.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.186
-You do the math.
-Excuse me.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.689
It's not very nice to talk about people
behind their backs.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.610
It's also not nice to eavesdrop.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.612
-So good seeing you.
-Good to see you.

12:16.695 --> 12:17.863
Bye.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.073
You're the nanny.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.451
-You were at Jericho's baptism.
-Yes.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.869
What was your name again?

12:23.952 --> 12:25.078
Leanne.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.414
-Right. Um, Grayman? Gray--
-Grayson.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.376
God, she would not shut up.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.461
You know?

12:32.544 --> 12:34.087
I'm glad you said something.

12:35.214 --> 12:36.548
Dorothy and I are old friends.

12:36.632 --> 12:39.301
I wouldn't have gotten
my first camera test if it wasn't for her.

12:39.384 --> 12:43.013
If you and Dorothy are such good friends,
then why do you try so hard to hurt her?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.640
I don't.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.727
I'm not sure why you'd say that.
I'm just doing my job.

12:49.937 --> 12:50.938
Okay.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.542
All right, everybody.
We have our last contestant.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.085
-What's your name?
-Kaylee.

13:13.168 --> 13:14.461
-Kaylee, how old are you?
-Eight.

13:14.545 --> 13:18.131
All right, everybody,
give it up for Kaylee.

13:35.440 --> 13:39.069
Go, Kaylee. Go, Kaylee. Go, Kaylee.

13:40.112 --> 13:42.155
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.867
You're half a tiger.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.535
No, I like it. I like it.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.289
I thought you were working.

13:51.123 --> 13:54.084
We ran out of ice cream,
so I guess I'm off the clock.

13:54.168 --> 13:55.711
Kaylee!

13:55.794 --> 13:57.629
You wanna do something?

13:59.131 --> 14:00.841
What did you have in mind?

14:01.466 --> 14:02.926
Yes!

14:03.010 --> 14:05.179
Yes. Yes.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.597
Mrs. Turner?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.473
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.602
I recognize you from the TV.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.271
I'm Nancy from Liberty Unitarian.

14:14.354 --> 14:18.025
I'm Sean's minister.
He told me so much about you.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.737
Hi, Jericho. It's good to see you.

14:22.529 --> 14:26.408
I'm sorry.
Sean has been attending your services?

14:26.491 --> 14:29.536
It's so lovely to see someone reconnect
with their faith.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.662
I don't mean to impose,

14:30.746 --> 14:33.790
but it would be so lovely to see you
at the church one day, Mrs. Turner.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.834
We don't bite.

14:38.462 --> 14:39.796
Dorothy.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.925
I'm sorry. What did you say
your name was, Minister...

14:43.008 --> 14:45.469
-It's just Nancy.
-Nancy.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.762
Pleasure to meet you.

14:48.639 --> 14:49.973
Hey. Not bad.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.184
How's Sylvia?

14:55.395 --> 14:56.605
I'm not sure.

14:57.397 --> 15:01.235
She kinda ghosted me after what happened.

15:01.318 --> 15:03.612
-"Ghosted"?
-Stopped talking to me.

15:05.697 --> 15:06.782
It wasn't your fault.

15:07.866 --> 15:11.036
I mean, I brought her
into that situation, so...

15:13.372 --> 15:14.831
But honestly, I'm kinda relieved.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.835
I mean, I knew she wasn't
right for me from the beginning.

15:18.836 --> 15:21.797
The whole thing was pretty toxic,
so, you know.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.048
Just glad it's over.

15:28.303 --> 15:31.515
-Nice!
-Nice job. Which one do you want?

15:36.103 --> 15:37.104
The llama.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.401
-Thank you.
-Thanks, man.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.695
Here.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.072
No, no, no. That's yours. You keep it.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.365
No, I want you to have it.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.868
Well. How about
I just hold on to it for you?

15:50.951 --> 15:51.952
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:52.911 --> 15:56.206
Listen, I think we should definitely go to
the bounce castle if that's up for you.

15:56.290 --> 15:57.499
-Okay.
-You up for it?

15:57.583 --> 15:59.084
-Yeah, sure.
-Yeah?

15:59.168 --> 16:01.670
-Let's do the bounce castle.
-Have you ever been there?

16:01.753 --> 16:03.463
-No.
-You've never been in a b--

16:06.508 --> 16:08.343
What are you doing in the corner?

16:08.427 --> 16:09.595
It's not scary. I promise.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.222
It's really fun.

16:12.306 --> 16:13.599
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.149
I knew it. It's a shark.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.484
Those are the teeth, and the whole
thing's gonna be the jaw of a shark.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.111
-You're not even close.
-What?

16:26.195 --> 16:28.405
-Not even in the same world.
-But she used a gray. Elephant?

16:28.488 --> 16:31.283
Do you feel the warmth of the sunshine

16:31.366 --> 16:35.746
shining over your cards you have
on the table today?

16:35.829 --> 16:36.955
Three minutes too long.

16:37.039 --> 16:39.458
Just three minutes,
and of course it explodes.

16:39.541 --> 16:42.419
And it-- it's all pink and everywhere.

16:42.503 --> 16:46.215
And Sean makes me stick my head
in the oven and clean the entire thing.

16:46.298 --> 16:49.426
He can't see a speck of pink
or if not, I'm fired.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.529
-Hello?
-Hey, Sean.

17:08.612 --> 17:11.198
It's, uh, Taylor from Gourmet Gauntlet.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.492
Remember me? I know it's been a minute.

17:13.575 --> 17:16.118
Look, I know you're super busy,
but I wanted to let you know

17:16.203 --> 17:18.454
we're putting together
a new spin-off series.

17:18.539 --> 17:19.665
It's on the east coast,

17:19.748 --> 17:21.875
and we're interested
in having you as the lead.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.167
We're coming to you--

17:35.639 --> 17:37.140
Do you wanna dance?

17:37.224 --> 17:38.350
Really?

17:39.059 --> 17:40.060
Yeah.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.370
Look, he's switching up the beat.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.588
There you are.

18:10.090 --> 18:13.010
I met your minister.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.891
Have you been taking Jericho to church?

18:18.974 --> 18:19.975
Yes.

18:22.311 --> 18:24.104
You conveniently forgot to tell me.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.275
I thought you'd think it was stupid.

18:28.901 --> 18:30.235
Screw you.

18:30.736 --> 18:32.029
Well, am I wrong?

18:33.155 --> 18:35.157
Of course I think it's stupid.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.034
What are you, a religious person now?

18:37.868 --> 18:40.495
Since I've been going to church,
things have been looking up.

18:40.579 --> 18:42.414
Well, that's great for you.

18:42.497 --> 18:44.499
But you've been whisking our son away
to a freak show

18:44.583 --> 18:46.502
and forcing the Lord down his throat.

18:46.585 --> 18:48.629
-You had him baptized.
-That was different.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.422
How is that different?

18:51.006 --> 18:52.508
It was a gesture.

18:52.591 --> 18:54.218
Well, to you maybe.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.929
Keep all the secrets you want.
I don't really care.

18:57.012 --> 19:00.390
But when it comes to raising our son,
I need transparency.

19:03.393 --> 19:06.313
I think the church would be good
in Jericho's life.

19:06.939 --> 19:08.524
You know, give him structure.

19:09.191 --> 19:10.776
It's important to me.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.612
Well, that's a start.

19:14.404 --> 19:17.866
It's not like you think. You know,
it's not all Latin and incense and shit.

19:17.950 --> 19:21.537
It's regular people,
talking like me and you.

19:21.620 --> 19:25.249
You know, I think you'd like Nancy,
if you give her a real, honest shot.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.333
Good.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.795
Then our dinner won't be awkward at all.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.299
-Your dinner?
-Yeah. I invited her to dinner.

19:34.383 --> 19:37.636
-Well, should we discuss it?
-Since when do we discuss things?

20:09.334 --> 20:10.919
-I'm hungry.
-What?

20:11.003 --> 20:13.046
Hungry! Food!

20:30.564 --> 20:31.648
Excuse me?

20:31.732 --> 20:33.108
Hi.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.652
Are you guys still open?

20:41.533 --> 20:42.743
Excuse me.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.933
Tobe. Tobe!

21:06.934 --> 21:08.143
Dorothy!

23:12.851 --> 23:15.479
-You good?
-Yeah. Yeah. I got it.

23:16.271 --> 23:17.523
Leanne?

23:17.606 --> 23:19.274
I bet she's upstairs.

23:24.154 --> 23:25.531
There you are.

23:25.614 --> 23:27.324
Thank God. We were worried about you.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.992
Tobe said you ran off on him.

23:29.076 --> 23:30.744
I was feeling a little tired.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.412
Of course you are.

23:33.497 --> 23:34.831
Look at you.

23:35.749 --> 23:38.043
You must be exhausted.

23:38.126 --> 23:42.130
This was a big step for you.
Being around so many strangers.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.675
And we're both very proud of you.
Aren't we, Sean?

23:45.676 --> 23:46.969
What do I do with this?

23:47.928 --> 23:49.096
I won that for Jericho.

23:49.179 --> 23:51.014
Ah, then I'll put it in the nursery.

23:54.810 --> 23:57.062
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

23:57.813 --> 24:00.524
Did something happen? With Tobe?

24:00.607 --> 24:03.318
No, nothing happened. I had fun.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.487
I'm glad.

24:05.571 --> 24:07.656
Well, I'm going to go to bed now.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.534
Do you want me to put Jericho down?

24:10.617 --> 24:13.871
No. I think I'll keep him up
a little while longer.

24:15.414 --> 24:16.415
You go on up.
