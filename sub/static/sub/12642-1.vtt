00:13.314 --> 00:16.882
Sydney: So this is it.
I'm coming home.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.584
Sort of.

00:19.854 --> 00:24.223
I mean, I was born here,
but I don't remember
anything.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.425
We left when I was really young,

00:26.427 --> 00:28.927
And dad never wanted
to come back,

00:28.929 --> 00:31.747
Probably 'cause of mom.

00:31.748 --> 00:34.566
Sometimes I think
I remember her,
but the truth?

00:34.568 --> 00:35.834
The picture in my head?

00:35.836 --> 00:39.438
It's probably
some old photograph.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.941
Elizabeth...

00:41.942 --> 00:44.443
She's the only mom
I've known up close.

00:44.979 --> 00:46.479
Woman: Ladies
and gentlemen,

00:46.480 --> 00:47.980
If you look out
the left side
of the aircraft,

00:47.982 --> 00:50.816
You'll get
an excellent view of
the hawaiian islands.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.985
That's kauai to the far left,

00:52.987 --> 00:56.622
And the big island
of hawaii on the right.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.326
Sit back, sydney.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.395
Buckle up.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.598
Sydney:
I know he does it
because he cares,

01:06.600 --> 01:10.636
Worrying like that.
But still...

02:10.497 --> 02:13.065
Wow, this is magical.

02:13.067 --> 02:16.101
Yeah.
It really is.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.769
Wow.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.846
I'm gonna look around, ok?

03:05.085 --> 03:08.020
Man: Paddle
a bit more.

03:46.994 --> 03:50.195
Sydney: I used to
watch the other kids
doing stuff,

03:50.197 --> 03:53.732
Stuff I didn't dare try.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.903
I didn't feel deprived.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.639
I had art classes, computers,

04:00.641 --> 04:02.174
But I'd think about it,

04:02.176 --> 04:05.077
What it would be like.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.712
Aaaaah!

05:15.282 --> 05:16.982
Ben: Sydney?

05:18.185 --> 05:19.117
Are you all right?

05:19.119 --> 05:20.619
Yeah. It was just a cat.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.155
You be careful.

05:23.157 --> 05:26.558
We don't know what
we might find here.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.094
Look at this place.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.797
Oh, these fabrics.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.765
1940s.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.133
The stitching...

05:35.135 --> 05:36.802
Oh, no. No, no, no.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.871
We made a deal, remember?

05:39.873 --> 05:41.640
Ben...

05:41.642 --> 05:43.675
Nothing comes back with us.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.710
You agreed.

05:44.712 --> 05:45.777
Yeah, under duress,

05:45.779 --> 05:47.312
Before I saw what was here.

05:47.313 --> 05:48.846
Sydney, wouldn't this
be great in your room?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.182
Wouldn't you love it?

05:50.184 --> 05:51.216
Hello.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.218
Oh, hello.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.220
<i>I kolo mai.</i>

05:54.221 --> 05:55.287
I'm sorry I'm late.

05:55.289 --> 05:56.688
I had to stop by the beach.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.558
The waves were
coming in so pretty.

05:59.560 --> 06:03.128
Anyway, aloha

06:06.200 --> 06:09.000
You must be sydney.

06:14.108 --> 06:16.108
Welcome.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.077
Uh, bo kauihou.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.079
We spoke on the telephone.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.215
Oh, right, of course.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.350
I... I was
expecting...

06:25.352 --> 06:26.352
3-piece suit?

06:26.353 --> 06:27.686
Well, I'm afraid we do things

06:27.688 --> 06:30.355
A lot more casual out here.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.024
The will is very clear.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.692
As ms. Leilani's
sister's granddaughter,

06:33.694 --> 06:36.027
Sydney is the last
remaining heir,

06:36.029 --> 06:37.696
The end of the line.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.664
So it all goes to her.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.466
Makai, the whole place.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.267
Providing she comes in person
to take possession,

06:43.270 --> 06:45.036
Which she obviously has.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.873
And that she stays 2 weeks.

06:47.875 --> 06:48.974
2 weeks?

06:48.976 --> 06:50.842
Those are the conditions.

06:50.844 --> 06:51.676
But...

06:51.678 --> 06:53.845
But the makai kuau,

06:53.847 --> 06:56.948
They have been ranching
here for 5 generations.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.683
Pineapple, sugarcane, cattle.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.319
The place has gotten
run down these past years,

07:01.321 --> 07:04.156
But the land,
it is still fertile.

07:04.158 --> 07:05.757
It could come back.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.225
Working plantation?

07:07.227 --> 07:10.295
You got to be kidding.
This is beachfront property.

07:10.297 --> 07:13.365
There are still value
in the old ways.

07:13.367 --> 07:17.235
Yes, but we got to be practical.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.705
We're not exactly farmers.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.184
Suppose we bring in a crew.

07:32.186 --> 07:34.085
Cleaned it up, painted it.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.087
You think we could find a buyer?

07:36.089 --> 07:39.758
There have been some inquiries.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.359
Really?

07:41.361 --> 07:42.361
Already?

07:42.362 --> 07:44.162
What kind of inquiries?

07:44.164 --> 07:46.998
Look, you've got to see this.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.366
What is it?

07:48.367 --> 07:49.733
The whole family, I think.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.237
These are old.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.738
Wow.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.307
Yeah.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.875
They seem so far away.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.850
Dad?

08:10.224 --> 08:12.224
Is it her?

08:12.226 --> 08:14.826
Is that mom?

08:15.429 --> 08:18.463
I never saw a picture
of her like that.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.999
Did she surf?

08:24.972 --> 08:28.340
She was so beautiful.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.515
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

10:50.517 --> 10:54.085
Here, kitty, kitty.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.499
Oh, my gosh!
Look out!

11:43.236 --> 11:44.536
Are you ok?

11:44.538 --> 11:45.670
I didn't see you.

11:45.672 --> 11:48.306
Ho, you're flying at mach 10.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.942
What'd you do,
see a ghost
or something?

11:50.944 --> 11:52.444
You're lucky I didn't...

11:52.446 --> 11:56.114
Whoa, sick board.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.585
Well, it's pretty cool, I guess.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.604
It's insane.

12:02.605 --> 12:04.622
Hey, how's it ride?
I bet it's awesome,
huh?

12:04.624 --> 12:07.158
Well...

12:07.160 --> 12:09.994
It's like, you know.

12:09.996 --> 12:12.230
Sweet.

12:12.699 --> 12:15.100
Definitely.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.634
I'm gia.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.503
Sydney.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.995
Wait a second.

12:20.996 --> 12:22.652
You're the long lost
relative, yeah?

12:22.653 --> 12:24.309
I mean, the whole
weird trip about
leilani's will.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.010
How'd you hear about that?

12:26.012 --> 12:27.445
This is the islands, sistah.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.548
News travels fast around here.

12:33.587 --> 12:37.455
Wow. I'm so not good
with computers.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.724
I can't believe
you can do all this.

12:39.726 --> 12:43.361
It's not that hard, really.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.364
These are awesome.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.633
You're really good.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.568
You ever shoot in the water?

12:50.570 --> 12:52.270
You know, up close?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.506
Well, that's when
you get the full-on
drama shots.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.174
You know, inside the curl?

12:56.176 --> 12:57.976
The board flying right at you.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.612
Putting it all on the line.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.280
It sounds wild.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.548
Yeah!

13:03.550 --> 13:05.216
Like riding the big ones,

13:05.218 --> 13:07.352
Deep thud pounding
your eardrums,

13:07.354 --> 13:09.587
Your heart beating so fast...

13:09.589 --> 13:12.123
Well, it's the best.

13:14.761 --> 13:15.994
I was thinking
maybe we could hike

13:15.996 --> 13:17.529
Into kaala loa valley tomorrow,

13:17.531 --> 13:20.999
Maybe get some
rocks to take home.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.768
Sound good?

13:23.770 --> 13:26.037
Or there's an exhibit
at the school...

13:26.039 --> 13:29.274
Handmade quilts.
Could be fabulous.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.442
Sydney?

13:31.444 --> 13:33.144
Oh, sorry.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.146
Um, about tomorrow?

13:35.148 --> 13:38.383
I was actually
thinking about
going to the beach.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.717
The beach?

13:39.719 --> 13:43.755
Sure. Um,
that sounds good,
doesn't it, ben?

13:44.191 --> 13:47.158
A picnic. I could get us
some sandwiches...

13:47.160 --> 13:50.028
No, I mean, just me.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.330
See, I met this girl.
Her name's...

13:52.332 --> 13:54.432
I don't want you
going down there,
sydney,

13:54.434 --> 13:55.500
Not to the beach.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.068
It's hawaii, dad.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.570
That's where kids go.

13:58.572 --> 14:01.306
They go all the time.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.207
Not alone.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.374
I won't be alone.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.777
Gia's going with her friends.

14:05.779 --> 14:06.711
We'll all be together.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.346
We don't even know these kids.

14:08.348 --> 14:12.317
I'll be careful, dad.
I promise.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.136
No. I'm sorry.

14:15.137 --> 14:17.087
Honey, it's just
not a good idea.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.656
That is so unfair.

14:18.658 --> 14:22.493
You're treating me
like I'm a baby. I'm 13.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.596
She said she'd be careful, ben.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.698
She knows what she's
capable of. Trust her.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.466
Does she know about undertows?

14:28.468 --> 14:29.534
About riptides?

14:29.536 --> 14:30.819
Does she know how these currents

14:30.820 --> 14:32.103
Can just come
whipping up
out of nowhere?

14:32.105 --> 14:36.774
Ok. Ok, just
take it easy.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.776
What if I don't even
go in the water?

14:38.778 --> 14:42.080
What if I just take pictures?

14:42.082 --> 14:44.315
Would that be ok?

14:44.317 --> 14:45.817
Dad?

14:46.620 --> 14:48.553
Please?

14:51.091 --> 14:52.690
Ben?

14:57.731 --> 14:59.564
Elizabeth: Have fun.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.499
Bye.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.334
Hello there.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.769
Hi.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.505
Sydney...

15:06.506 --> 15:07.739
You have the cell phone, right?

15:07.741 --> 15:08.873
If you need us?

15:08.875 --> 15:09.774
Got it.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.409
You know the number?

15:11.411 --> 15:13.678
Dad.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.780
What if she's not
there, this girl?

15:15.782 --> 15:17.749
She'll be there.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.350
But if she's not?

15:19.352 --> 15:21.286
I'll come back.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.288
Right back.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.358
Hello there.
Aloha.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.860
This is ben and elizabeth.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.328
Hi.
Hi, ben.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.562
Hi, nice to see you.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.498
Ok.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.433
Bo: Uh, these
are the realtors
I told you about.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.189
Whooooo!

16:32.692 --> 16:33.692
Hey!

16:33.693 --> 16:34.726
Hey!

16:34.728 --> 16:37.295
Who's the grom?

16:37.630 --> 16:39.163
You know her?

16:39.164 --> 16:40.697
She's the one I told you about.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.633
Oh.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.271
Hey, you made it.

16:46.272 --> 16:47.338
Yeah, I made it.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.439
It's so good out there.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.675
Head-high waves.
Perfect rights. Come on.

16:50.677 --> 16:54.412
You know, I think
I'll just, like,
hang a little bit.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.647
You know, cruise.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.783
Ok, sure, whatever.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.485
Ok.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.789
Wow, what a great beach house.

17:04.790 --> 17:08.826
Yeah, we put it together
from things we found
on the beach.

17:08.828 --> 17:09.794
Cool.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.729
Uh-huh.

17:19.472 --> 17:23.241
Ooh! Good way
to lose a fin.

17:27.280 --> 17:31.282
 If you don't trip
or fall right down 

17:31.284 --> 17:34.886
 all your favorite bands
are all sold out 

17:34.888 --> 17:35.888
Hey.

17:35.889 --> 17:36.721
Hi.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.688
This is lanea...

17:37.690 --> 17:38.790
Hi.
And mele.

17:38.792 --> 17:39.624
Hi.
Hi.

17:39.626 --> 17:40.825
Sydney, right?
Yeah.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.026
You from the mainland?

17:42.028 --> 17:44.162
Chicago.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.297
Oh, that's where
the wind surfing
goes off, yeah?

17:46.298 --> 17:48.432
Well, the wind blows
pretty hard off
the lake, but I never...

17:48.435 --> 17:49.967
Your board is awesome.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.986
Pretty old school.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.004
Didn't I tell you?
Isn't it seriously
outrageous?

17:54.007 --> 17:55.706
Boy: Hey, girls!

17:55.708 --> 17:58.476
Hey!
Hey!

18:01.848 --> 18:03.347
Hey, what's up?

18:03.349 --> 18:04.482
What's going on?

18:04.484 --> 18:05.683
Hey, let's go surf.

18:05.685 --> 18:06.951
Come on, let's go surfing.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.653
All right.

18:19.866 --> 18:23.367
 Please come
to the show tonight 

18:23.369 --> 18:28.773
 I promise everything's
gonna be all right 

18:28.775 --> 18:30.308
This is so pathetic.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.944
Stuck in dry dock.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.512
I can't believe it.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.480
The worst.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.648
Except you get to hang with us.

18:37.650 --> 18:38.650
When's it come off?

18:38.651 --> 18:40.051
Uh, not soon enough.

18:40.053 --> 18:41.519
What'd you do?

18:41.521 --> 18:42.386
Skateboard wreck.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.088
Crashed off a half pipe.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.590
He tried a 4 1/2,

18:45.592 --> 18:46.958
Which is of course nuts.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.759
'cause nobody does a 4 1/2.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.362
You're just jealous
'cause I'm gonna
nail it

18:51.364 --> 18:53.514
Before you do.

18:53.515 --> 18:55.665
In your dreams, plaster arm.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.505
I'm outta here. Laters.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.777
Yo, kai!

19:07.447 --> 19:08.980
It's bowling out there!

19:08.982 --> 19:11.782
Go charge it, bra!

19:19.025 --> 19:22.393
What, break your lens?

19:23.863 --> 19:26.531
I'm kona.
Sydney.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.501
Hey, come on.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.645
Watch mele.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.782
Leg drop.
Phat snap.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.386
Deep bottom turn.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.487
She's going off!

19:49.489 --> 19:51.122
That's good, right?

19:51.124 --> 19:52.857
That's hot.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.725
See?
Totally fearless.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.061
But don't tell her
I've been
bragging on her.

19:57.063 --> 20:00.798
We wouldn't want her
getting a big head.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.085
Is she all right?

20:21.087 --> 20:23.654
Oh, yeah.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.023
You're a surfer, too?

20:26.025 --> 20:27.892
I mean, when you're
not wearing that.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.493
Everyone surfs around here,

20:29.495 --> 20:31.896
Unless they're a major dork.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.732
You're a longboarder, ey?

20:34.734 --> 20:35.900
Sort of.

20:35.902 --> 20:36.934
I ride shortboard.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.203
Uh, but I like those, too.

20:39.205 --> 20:40.938
Exactly.

20:40.939 --> 20:42.672
The thing about
the longboards,
riding them?

20:42.675 --> 20:45.876
It's like cruising on the waves,

20:45.878 --> 20:47.745
Slow and fluid.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.146
Keeps you connected.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.615
But a shortboard,

20:50.617 --> 20:52.650
It's like daring you
to meet the edge,

20:52.652 --> 20:54.719
Slice through the other side.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.655
You make your own rules.

20:59.826 --> 21:00.725
What?

21:00.727 --> 21:02.693
You're a poet.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.629
I didn't expect it.

21:04.631 --> 21:07.632
I don't know, it's nice.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.100
It must be hard, I mean,

21:09.102 --> 21:12.003
Learning how to ride
the short ones.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.604
Must take forever, huh?

21:13.606 --> 21:17.208
You've never been
out there before,
have you?

21:17.210 --> 21:20.011
What?! Why would you
say that?

21:20.013 --> 21:22.513
Because you haven't, right?

21:22.515 --> 21:26.017
Well, you mean, technically?

21:26.019 --> 21:28.819
Out there surfing?

21:31.024 --> 21:32.223
No.

21:32.225 --> 21:34.225
Never even tried?

21:34.226 --> 21:36.226
There's not
a lot of surf
in lake michigan.

21:36.229 --> 21:39.563
I mean, besides,
I know what my parents
would say...

21:39.565 --> 21:42.933
Too risky, too dangerous,
too everything.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.803
That is so crazy.

21:46.539 --> 21:47.905
Keep your center of balance.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.040
Now paddle.

21:49.042 --> 21:51.142
Harder. Harder.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.276
Ok, now stand up.

21:52.278 --> 21:54.512
Come on, stand up!

21:55.048 --> 21:56.564
Yeah!
Yeah!

21:56.565 --> 21:58.081
You've got it, you're ready.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.750
For what?

21:59.752 --> 22:02.019
Well, what'd you think?

22:08.261 --> 22:09.994
Gia?

22:09.996 --> 22:11.128
What?

22:11.130 --> 22:12.730
You scared?

22:12.732 --> 22:14.198
No.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.618
Yeah.

22:16.619 --> 22:18.169
Hey, being scared,
that's half the fun.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.770
Your heart pounding so hard,

22:19.772 --> 22:21.272
All you want to do is quit,

22:21.274 --> 22:23.774
And then doing it anyway.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.079
They're gonna think
I'm a major dork.

22:28.081 --> 22:30.548
You don't surf for your friends.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.716
You do it for yourself.

22:31.718 --> 22:35.286
For the way
it makes you feel inside.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.622
It's like floating on clouds.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.191
Come on.

22:45.198 --> 22:49.100
Don't forget,
keep your board
to the side.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.747
Hey, you'll get it.

23:36.749 --> 23:37.982
In how many lifetimes?

23:37.984 --> 23:40.618
No rush. The ocean's
not going anywhere.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.254
I am. I'm only here
for 2 weeks.

23:43.256 --> 23:46.791
What about makai?
I mean,
isn't it yours?

23:46.793 --> 23:47.892
Aren't you staying?

23:47.894 --> 23:49.538
How can we?

23:49.539 --> 23:51.183
My dad's an english professor,

23:51.184 --> 23:52.828
And my stepmom
designs fabrics
for this big company.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.266
I don't think
they'd want to move.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.667
What about you?

23:56.669 --> 23:59.136
What do you want?

24:03.009 --> 24:05.342
Sydney? Your things
on the floor?

24:05.344 --> 24:09.013
That's why they
make hampers, ok?

24:15.188 --> 24:17.121
Sydney?

24:18.324 --> 24:21.058
We'd like to, uh,
eat dinner at 7:00.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.226
Can you be ready?

24:22.228 --> 24:23.828
Yeah, sure.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.429
Good.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.065
Did you have fun with
your friends today?

24:28.067 --> 24:29.934
Were they helpful?

24:29.936 --> 24:31.502
What?

24:31.503 --> 24:33.069
About having their
pictures taken.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.339
They didn't mind?

24:35.341 --> 24:39.810
Oh, yeah.
They were great.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.348
Elizabeth...

24:45.051 --> 24:46.016
Hmm?

24:46.018 --> 24:46.951
Since we got here,

24:46.953 --> 24:49.453
Dad's been so weird, you know?

24:49.455 --> 24:51.021
More than usual.

24:51.023 --> 24:53.824
Is he like mad
at me or something?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.159
Has he said anything?

24:55.161 --> 24:57.194
No, no, honey, it's not you.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.463
He's not mad at you.

24:59.465 --> 25:01.165
It's, um...

25:01.167 --> 25:04.368
Sometimes adults
just get lost in
their own problems

25:04.370 --> 25:05.336
And they don't realize...

25:05.338 --> 25:08.339
What? Is dad
losing his job?

25:08.341 --> 25:10.124
Is he sick?

25:10.125 --> 25:11.908
No, no, no, nothing like that.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.344
It's just stuff.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.380
Boring adult stuff.

25:16.382 --> 25:19.350
He treats me like
I'm a piece of glass,

25:19.352 --> 25:20.885
Like I'm gonna break.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.486
Well, you're his little girl.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.121
He worries.

25:24.122 --> 25:25.755
That's what dads do.
They worry.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.792
But it's not like
I'm this out of control
crazy.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.294
I'm really careful.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.197
I know that, and he knows that,

25:33.199 --> 25:36.000
And that's good.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.203
Sometimes I wish I wasn't,

25:39.205 --> 25:41.505
That I wasn't so careful.

25:41.507 --> 25:45.809
I could just try things,
like everyone else.

25:45.811 --> 25:47.177
Not think so much.

25:47.179 --> 25:50.948
Sweetheart,
we all do things
at our own pace,

25:50.950 --> 25:53.784
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.185
As far as thinking too much,

25:55.187 --> 25:58.289
Just keep using
that head of yours.

25:58.291 --> 26:00.257
You're good at it.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.393
All right?

26:10.469 --> 26:13.337
You said that this buyer
made a previous offer?

26:13.339 --> 26:16.840
Oh, yeah, not that
it was taken seriously.

26:16.842 --> 26:18.075
Old mrs. Leilani.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.810
She was such a dear woman.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.962
You would have adored her,

26:21.963 --> 26:24.113
But, you know,
she was hardly
interested in selling.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.449
Makai was her home.

26:25.451 --> 26:28.085
The only one she'd ever known.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.954
She loved it here.

26:29.956 --> 26:32.356
Which meant
she didn't even
take a look

26:32.358 --> 26:34.258
At our original
proposal we brought.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.960
Oh, no, it wouldn't
have mattered

26:35.962 --> 26:38.128
If king midas himself
had offered

26:38.130 --> 26:39.530
Every ounce of his gold.

26:39.532 --> 26:41.966
And that's
pretty much
the kind of offer

26:41.968 --> 26:43.233
These horden folks delivered.

26:43.235 --> 26:46.837
Yeah. Here, come look,
you'll absolutely gush.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.039
Let's look.

26:52.478 --> 26:54.378
Ta-da!

26:58.084 --> 26:59.516
The detail's amazing.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.986
Look, even the little trees.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.120
Isn't it something?

27:03.122 --> 27:06.924
Where's the house
and the old barn?

27:06.926 --> 27:08.826
Oh, they'll keep the name.

27:08.828 --> 27:11.829
"horden resort at
plantation makai."

27:11.831 --> 27:13.897
But you could hardly expect them

27:13.899 --> 27:15.399
To keep the original structures.

27:15.401 --> 27:18.402
Why not?
They're historical.

27:18.404 --> 27:19.903
Yes, 1912.

27:19.905 --> 27:23.407
That's when
they rebuilt it
after the big storm.

27:23.409 --> 27:24.508
It is a charming old house.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.477
It'd be almost
a shame to see it go.

27:26.479 --> 27:27.911
Well, there is no reason

27:27.913 --> 27:29.663
Why we can't talk to horden

27:29.664 --> 27:31.414
About preserving
some of these
buildings.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.417
Uh, in fact, the main house

27:33.419 --> 27:35.452
Would make a darling
little restaurant.

27:35.454 --> 27:39.857
That's
an inspired idea.
It's brilliant.

27:39.859 --> 27:42.159
What happens to the beach?

27:42.161 --> 27:43.794
Oh, not one thing.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.428
It remains
as pure and
pristine as ever.

27:45.431 --> 27:48.032
The guests would
hardly settle
for anything less.

27:48.034 --> 27:51.035
So it would only be
open to hotel guests?

27:51.037 --> 27:53.337
Everything's negotiable.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.939
Believe me, every little detail

27:55.941 --> 27:58.108
Can be worked out.
Right, bo?

27:58.110 --> 28:01.578
Why don't you draw up
the list of concerns
for horden?

28:01.580 --> 28:03.981
If that's what the millers want.

28:03.983 --> 28:06.283
It's certainly
a lot to
think about.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.585
Well, it never hurts
to open a dialogue,

28:08.587 --> 28:11.522
Just see what your options are.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.493
James; well,
I think once again

28:16.495 --> 28:19.163
If we take a look at
horden's track record...

28:19.165 --> 28:21.498
Arlene: Absolutely.

29:36.242 --> 29:37.074
Hey!

29:37.076 --> 29:38.609
It's only water.

29:38.611 --> 29:39.977
Where you been?

29:39.979 --> 29:41.278
I was busy.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.713
You didn't chicken out?

29:42.715 --> 29:44.014
Thought about it.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.016
Guess I'm still
thinking about it.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.084
Don't worry, girl.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.719
You owning these waves today.

29:48.721 --> 29:50.454
I can feel it.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.389
You want some?

29:53.025 --> 29:55.659
It's spam musabi.
Total energy food.

29:55.661 --> 29:57.594
No, thanks.

30:09.575 --> 30:13.477
 Hurry up,
we're all ready 

30:13.479 --> 30:17.781
 all you need to bring
is yourself 

30:18.384 --> 30:22.119
 kinda go slow,
take it steady 

30:22.121 --> 30:25.656
 'cause there's no room
for nobody else 

30:25.658 --> 30:28.292
 sun is high,
sky is blue 

30:28.294 --> 30:31.278
 it's so right 

30:31.279 --> 30:34.263
 we're just waitin'
for you... 

30:34.266 --> 30:35.432
Hey.

30:35.434 --> 30:36.700
Hey.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.402
Hey.

30:38.404 --> 30:42.339
 We're just waiting
for you 

30:42.341 --> 30:44.675
 we know what to do... 

30:44.677 --> 30:47.377
That's it.

30:47.379 --> 30:50.714
Come on.
You're doing great.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.386
Yeah.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.390
Ok. Here, turn it.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.594
Yeah. That's the way.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.264
Good.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.435
Ok. Not this one.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.304
Just hang loose.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.172
 Give it up,
mr. Blue sky 

31:17.659 --> 31:20.143
 speedin' right on
into the bay... 

31:21.080 --> 31:24.648
We have to wait
for just the right set.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.083
These lookin' perfect.

31:26.085 --> 31:28.318
Go! Kick it, bra!

31:29.321 --> 31:30.354
Go! Go for it!

31:30.356 --> 31:32.155
Go, girl! Whoo!

31:34.193 --> 31:35.826
Yeah, girl!

31:35.828 --> 31:38.328
Come on, sydney! Whoo!

31:38.330 --> 31:39.596
Yeah, sydney!

31:39.598 --> 31:40.598
 It's so right 

31:40.599 --> 31:43.667
 we're just waitin'
for you 

31:43.669 --> 31:44.868
Whoo! Yeah!

31:44.870 --> 31:47.170
 We know what to do 

31:47.172 --> 31:49.139
 we know what to do 

31:49.141 --> 31:50.674
 so rev it up 

31:50.676 --> 31:53.377
 I said 

31:53.746 --> 31:57.714
 we know
where we're goin' 

31:57.716 --> 31:59.583
 rev it up 

31:59.585 --> 32:01.685
 full ahead 

32:01.687 --> 32:02.853
 closer 

32:02.855 --> 32:05.889
 the wind is blowin' 

32:05.891 --> 32:07.591
 it's so fine 

32:07.593 --> 32:10.193
 yeah... 

32:10.195 --> 32:11.195
Whoo!

32:11.196 --> 32:12.429
Gia!

32:12.431 --> 32:14.431
Did you see?
I did it!

32:14.433 --> 32:15.732
I actually did it.

32:15.734 --> 32:18.335
All right, sydney!
You finally did it.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.203
You surfer girl!

32:21.273 --> 32:22.739
Hey!
Hey!

32:24.610 --> 32:26.343
Hey, dry dock!

32:26.345 --> 32:28.745
Surf's up.

32:30.683 --> 32:34.084
Gia: Whoo! Go, boy!

32:37.890 --> 32:41.458
You and kona, are you, like...

32:41.460 --> 32:42.326
Tight?

32:42.328 --> 32:44.361
Yeah. He's my boy.

32:44.363 --> 32:45.462
So you like him?

32:45.464 --> 32:48.532
Completely. Hey,
he's my best friend.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.734
He's almost like a...

32:50.736 --> 32:52.536
Wait a second.

32:52.537 --> 32:54.337
You mean <i> like</i> him like him?

32:54.340 --> 32:55.172
Yeah.

32:55.174 --> 32:56.340
Kona?

32:56.342 --> 32:57.874
No way.

32:57.876 --> 32:59.810
Not like that.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.380
Why? Do you?

33:05.351 --> 33:07.684
Hey, that's awesome.
He'll be stoked.

33:07.686 --> 33:08.852
Hey, kona!

33:08.854 --> 33:10.420
No, no, no, no!
You can't.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.289
I'd just die.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.890
Ok. Fine.

33:13.892 --> 33:15.926
Promise?

33:16.228 --> 33:18.228
But he'd definitely be stoked.

33:18.230 --> 33:19.563
You think so?

33:19.565 --> 33:21.398
Oh, yeah.

33:21.900 --> 33:25.836
Is he as together as he seems?

33:25.838 --> 33:26.838
Best part?

33:26.839 --> 33:28.872
He's a great listener.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.874
You can tell him
almost anything.

33:30.876 --> 33:32.843
Really?

33:32.844 --> 33:34.811
And you know
those cartoons
in the clubhouse?

33:34.813 --> 33:36.480
They're his.

33:36.482 --> 33:37.681
He drew those?

33:37.683 --> 33:39.216
Oh, yeah.
Kona's a star.

33:39.218 --> 33:41.218
Hey, but don't get too excited.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.469
'cause under all that nuggetry,

33:42.470 --> 33:43.719
He's still
a thick-headed
gross-out boy

33:43.722 --> 33:46.289
Just like the rest of them.

33:48.293 --> 33:49.226
Hey.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.327
Come on, move it.

33:50.329 --> 33:51.395
We've got waves to catch.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.530
I think I'll just
hang it up while..

33:53.532 --> 33:54.731
You know, while I'm ahead.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.299
Stop. Come on,
it'll be perfect,

33:56.301 --> 33:57.868
Just like before.

33:57.870 --> 33:59.970
Come on.

34:16.789 --> 34:18.355
Yeah. That's the way.
You got it.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.456
Ok. Now sit up.

34:20.458 --> 34:23.360
Good. Turn around.

34:30.835 --> 34:33.270
No. Sydney!

34:33.272 --> 34:34.905
Not this one!

34:34.907 --> 34:37.808
Oh! Hang on!

35:41.406 --> 35:44.040
Is she gonna be all right, gia?

35:44.042 --> 35:45.675
Somebody go get my mom.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.544
Go get malia.

35:47.546 --> 35:48.678
Hurry.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.947
Is it that bad?

35:50.949 --> 35:52.048
You'll be ok.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.950
I mean, a little dinged,

35:53.952 --> 35:56.486
But no permanent damage.

35:57.089 --> 35:59.089
Uh!

36:29.021 --> 36:30.788
Uh-uh-uh.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.556
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.491
You're fine.

36:36.094 --> 36:39.095
Do you remember what happened?

36:39.097 --> 36:40.797
I think so.

36:40.799 --> 36:43.833
I don't really want
to talk about it.

36:43.835 --> 36:46.069
Oh. Tell me.

36:47.472 --> 36:50.707
It was in slow motion.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.742
Scary, but...

36:52.744 --> 36:54.177
Not scary, at the same time.

36:54.179 --> 36:57.047
Like I was watching
the whole thing

36:57.049 --> 36:58.548
From someplace else.

36:58.550 --> 37:04.487
Like I was some other person
watching myself drown.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.423
Well, you drink this.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.858
Drink it.

37:12.931 --> 37:13.863
Mmm!

37:13.865 --> 37:15.565
Good, yeah, that.

37:15.567 --> 37:16.866
What is it?

37:16.868 --> 37:18.735
Old island cure,

37:18.736 --> 37:20.603
A secret from the <i> menehuene...</i>

37:20.606 --> 37:21.538
The little ones.

37:21.540 --> 37:22.672
Bring it in the night

37:22.674 --> 37:24.641
When no one can see.

37:24.643 --> 37:25.809
You're teasing me.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.177
No. It's always
at night.

37:27.179 --> 37:28.912
If they're caught by the sun,

37:28.914 --> 37:31.781
They... They
turn to stone.

37:31.783 --> 37:34.618
Everyone knows that.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.121
Why are you staring like that?

37:38.123 --> 37:40.023
Oh, you're so much like her.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.058
Like who?

37:42.060 --> 37:43.493
Gia: Hey, mom.

37:43.495 --> 37:44.527
Hey.

37:44.529 --> 37:45.795
How's the head?

37:45.797 --> 37:46.696
Ok.

37:46.698 --> 37:48.465
But I sure messed up, huh?

37:48.467 --> 37:50.000
I thought it was all over.

37:50.002 --> 37:52.068
Nah. The wave would've
spit you out.

37:52.070 --> 37:53.770
No big thing, yeah?

37:53.772 --> 37:56.106
How about kona?
Is he ok?

37:56.108 --> 37:57.874
Well, his cast
is a little soggy,

37:57.876 --> 37:59.142
But you made him a hero.

37:59.144 --> 38:00.460
He's stoked.

38:00.461 --> 38:01.777
He wants to know when
you're going back out.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.747
In the water?

38:03.748 --> 38:05.715
How about the week after never?

38:05.717 --> 38:08.785
Never's a long time.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.759
Sydney: Are they
all yours?

38:15.761 --> 38:17.260
My mom's, mostly.

38:17.262 --> 38:20.230
She surfs, still?

38:20.232 --> 38:21.765
Malia: Hey. I heard that.

38:21.767 --> 38:25.602
Well, not that you're
old or anything.

38:25.604 --> 38:26.870
I didn't mean that.

38:26.872 --> 38:28.672
Uh-huh.

38:31.510 --> 38:34.210
Sydney: Oh, no.

38:35.614 --> 38:36.913
I can't believe I wrecked it.

38:36.915 --> 38:40.216
Yeah, well, maybe
mom can fix it.

38:40.218 --> 38:43.820
Really? Could you?

39:05.711 --> 39:08.144
She's the one you remind me of.

39:08.146 --> 39:11.314
There was a real naniloa?

39:11.316 --> 39:13.250
Absolutely.

39:13.251 --> 39:15.185
That was her nickname...
Your mother.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.722
Are you serious?

39:19.991 --> 39:22.058
Mm. This was hers.

39:24.262 --> 39:26.229
When I first saw it,

39:26.231 --> 39:28.865
I felt something...

39:28.867 --> 39:32.235
Like I could just tell.

39:32.237 --> 39:34.704
Were you friends,
you and my mom?

39:34.706 --> 39:35.522
Like sisters.

39:35.523 --> 39:36.339
Ever since we were little,

39:36.341 --> 39:38.641
We did everything together.

39:38.643 --> 39:42.312
Your dad never
mentioned anything?

39:44.049 --> 39:49.319
He doesn't talk much,
not about her.

39:49.321 --> 39:53.857
Well, she was amazing,
always laughing.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.191
It was contagious.

39:55.193 --> 39:56.726
She made everybody smile.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.094
And full of energy, huh?

39:58.096 --> 40:00.196
She would walk into a room,

40:00.198 --> 40:02.732
And you could almost see it.

40:02.734 --> 40:06.936
It's so strange...
Hearing about her,

40:06.938 --> 40:11.608
Having something that was hers.

40:11.610 --> 40:14.911
It almost makes her real.

40:15.213 --> 40:18.648
I wanna show you something.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.735
Look. See?

40:38.737 --> 40:42.238
We gotta climb.
Come on.

40:53.718 --> 40:57.387
Sydney: It's the most
beautiful place
I've ever seen.

40:57.389 --> 40:59.923
The whales come here
with their young

40:59.925 --> 41:01.124
Every year about this time.

41:01.126 --> 41:05.061
It's an extraordinary
place, sacred.

41:05.063 --> 41:07.030
Have you ever seen them?

41:07.032 --> 41:08.365
Mm-hmm.

41:08.366 --> 41:09.699
And the first time
was with your mom.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.033
We were a little
younger than you,

41:11.036 --> 41:13.269
And your
great-grandmother
brought us.

41:13.271 --> 41:15.638
There's a welcoming ceremony.

41:15.639 --> 41:18.006
It's a celebration
naniloa thought
was magical.

41:18.009 --> 41:21.811
She said
it was something
she'd never forget.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.746
Could you bring me?

41:23.748 --> 41:26.749
I mean, if they come
while I'm here.

41:26.751 --> 41:28.101
Could you?

41:28.102 --> 41:29.452
It's like being offered a gift,

41:29.454 --> 41:30.887
Seeing the whales.

41:30.888 --> 41:32.321
You have to be ready for it.

41:35.160 --> 41:38.094
Sydney: Hello?
Anybody home?

41:38.096 --> 41:41.798
Probably called out
the national guard by now.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.433
No. They can't be
that worried.

41:43.435 --> 41:46.035
Elizabeth: Sydney?
Is that you?

41:46.037 --> 41:47.270
Or maybe they can.

41:47.272 --> 41:49.005
Should I tell them?

41:49.007 --> 41:49.873
It's up to you.

41:49.875 --> 41:53.810
Oh, we've been so worried.

41:54.479 --> 41:56.412
Your father's
out there right now

41:56.414 --> 41:59.015
Looking everywhere for you.

42:02.721 --> 42:03.920
What happened?

42:03.922 --> 42:05.321
Are you all right?

42:05.323 --> 42:07.290
Yeah. It's nothing,
just a little cut.

42:07.292 --> 42:08.191
I'm fine.

42:08.193 --> 42:12.028
This is gia's mom...
Malia.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.230
She took care of me.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.166
Thank you so much.

42:17.168 --> 42:19.903
Really.

42:19.905 --> 42:21.404
You didn't get
stitches, did you?

42:21.406 --> 42:22.872
What'd you hit it on?

42:22.874 --> 42:24.507
It's no big deal, honest.

42:24.509 --> 42:27.243
She's fine.

42:29.047 --> 42:31.514
Ben? She's here.

42:37.188 --> 42:38.922
You're safe.
Thank heaven.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.823
Where have you been?

42:40.825 --> 42:42.859
What happened?

42:43.962 --> 42:45.328
I...

42:45.330 --> 42:46.396
I, uh...

42:46.398 --> 42:47.463
Well...

42:47.465 --> 42:50.500
I know I wasn't
supposed to, but...

42:50.502 --> 42:52.335
Being a part of it...

42:52.337 --> 42:55.104
Not being stuck on the outside,

42:55.106 --> 42:58.408
But really being
a part of something,

42:58.410 --> 43:00.376
I always wanted that.

43:00.378 --> 43:01.911
What are you
talking about, baby?

43:01.913 --> 43:04.314
You're not making sense.

43:06.551 --> 43:09.352
Well...

43:10.789 --> 43:14.324
I went surfing
with the other kids.

43:14.326 --> 43:16.125
What?!

43:17.062 --> 43:18.995
I'm sorry, but...

43:18.996 --> 43:20.929
I know you didn't
want me to go out there,

43:20.932 --> 43:24.300
But I had to try...
To see if I could do it.

43:24.302 --> 43:25.902
And then I fell, but...

43:25.904 --> 43:27.437
I didn't get hurt,
not seriously.

43:27.439 --> 43:30.807
So there's nothing
to worry about,
right, dad?

43:30.809 --> 43:32.508
Go to your room, sydney.

43:32.510 --> 43:33.409
But, dad...

43:33.411 --> 43:35.178
To your room. Now.

43:35.180 --> 43:37.580
That's not fair.
I just...
sydney!

43:42.187 --> 43:43.419
Ben: How could you do this?

43:43.421 --> 43:45.321
Malia: She wanted it.
You heard her.

43:45.323 --> 43:47.223
This has nothing to do with me.

43:47.225 --> 43:48.858
I'm supposed to believe that,

43:48.859 --> 43:50.492
That you weren't out there
cheering her on,

43:50.495 --> 43:52.161
Filling her head
full of stories?

43:52.163 --> 43:53.396
Well, you certainly
haven't been.

43:53.398 --> 43:55.264
Everything is completely
foreign to her.

43:55.266 --> 43:56.899
You've never even
mentioned my name.

43:56.901 --> 43:58.534
Why? Why haven't you
told her, ben?

43:58.536 --> 44:00.603
I am not gonna let her get hurt.

44:00.605 --> 44:02.405
That is the bottom line.

44:02.407 --> 44:03.473
She needs to know who she is

44:03.475 --> 44:05.842
And where she comes from.

44:05.844 --> 44:06.893
She does.

44:06.894 --> 44:07.943
No. You've
kept her from it.

44:07.946 --> 44:09.445
You whisked her away,
and you've cut her off.

44:09.447 --> 44:11.481
I have tried to do
what's best for her.

44:11.483 --> 44:13.182
That is all I care about.

44:13.184 --> 44:16.152
I've never seen him like this.

44:16.154 --> 44:18.388
He's so...

44:18.390 --> 44:19.589
I know.

44:19.591 --> 44:22.225
It'll be ok.

44:25.063 --> 44:28.631
She oughta be grabbing
life with both hands,

44:28.633 --> 44:30.400
But you've got her
so scared, so...

44:30.402 --> 44:32.268
Don't make it sound so simple.

44:32.270 --> 44:33.536
Use what's here, ben.

44:33.538 --> 44:35.438
The ocean is a great healer.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.674
And a great destroyer.

44:37.675 --> 44:39.909
No. If you'd just seen her
out there with gia.

44:39.911 --> 44:42.078
She is a natural,
just like her...

44:42.080 --> 44:43.613
Leave her alone, malia.

44:43.615 --> 44:44.981
Back off.

44:44.983 --> 44:47.550
You can't protect her forever.

44:47.552 --> 44:49.419
I can try.

44:49.421 --> 44:52.488
Stop running from it, ben.

44:52.490 --> 44:54.057
Pry it open,

44:54.058 --> 44:55.625
This lid you've got
clamped down so hard.

44:55.627 --> 44:56.627
Let it go.

44:56.628 --> 44:59.629
Let things heal.

45:14.512 --> 45:17.213
Elizabeth: She's not
entirely wrong.

45:17.515 --> 45:20.416
I didn't even know
you were there.

45:20.652 --> 45:23.553
That's part of the problem.

45:23.555 --> 45:26.289
Things will be fine
once we're back home,

45:26.291 --> 45:27.990
Away from this place.

45:27.992 --> 45:29.292
Everything will be normal again.

45:29.294 --> 45:31.394
What is that supposed to mean,

45:31.395 --> 45:33.495
That we'll just
keep pretending
it never happened?

45:33.498 --> 45:35.865
No, of course not.

45:35.866 --> 45:38.233
Ben, if you'd
fallen in love
with another woman,

45:38.236 --> 45:40.236
Someone flesh and blood,

45:40.238 --> 45:42.305
I'd know what to do.

45:42.306 --> 45:44.373
And I would
fight like crazy
to hang on to us,

45:44.375 --> 45:47.243
To what we have together.

45:47.245 --> 45:49.011
But this?

45:49.013 --> 45:50.096
Liz...

45:50.097 --> 45:51.180
What am I supposed to do?

45:51.182 --> 45:53.049
Tell me, ben.

45:53.051 --> 45:57.987
How am I supposed
to fight a ghost?

46:13.538 --> 46:15.471
Hey.

46:17.008 --> 46:19.208
Hey.

46:23.381 --> 46:24.514
I called your house.

46:24.516 --> 46:26.649
Your stepmom said
you were out here.

46:26.651 --> 46:28.084
You ok?

46:28.086 --> 46:29.252
Yeah.

46:29.254 --> 46:30.386
You sure?

46:30.388 --> 46:32.622
A little bummed.

46:32.624 --> 46:34.524
My dad was so mad.

46:34.526 --> 46:35.526
I heard.

46:35.527 --> 46:37.126
If I try it again,

46:37.128 --> 46:39.228
He'll probably
ground me for life.

46:39.230 --> 46:40.763
What's his problem?

46:40.765 --> 46:42.999
Must be all about
your mom's accident, huh?

46:43.001 --> 46:45.735
What do you know about it?

46:45.737 --> 46:48.404
Did malia tell you?

46:48.406 --> 46:49.505
Well, not much.

46:49.507 --> 46:51.024
I mean, you know,

46:51.025 --> 46:52.542
Just that there was
an accident out there.

46:52.544 --> 46:54.377
In the ocean?

46:54.378 --> 46:56.211
That's just what
I've always heard.

46:56.214 --> 46:58.481
Of course, I could
have it all wrong.

46:58.483 --> 47:00.283
It wouldn't be the first time.

47:00.285 --> 47:03.286
I mean, don't you know?

47:03.288 --> 47:05.421
What does your dad say?

47:05.423 --> 47:06.255
Nothing.

47:06.257 --> 47:07.223
That's the problem.

47:07.225 --> 47:11.160
How come you never asked him?

47:11.162 --> 47:13.396
Stupid, huh?

47:13.398 --> 47:14.530
Not knowing,

47:14.532 --> 47:17.200
Not making him tell me.

47:20.572 --> 47:23.072
It's not too late.

48:20.665 --> 48:21.497
Hey, gia!

48:21.499 --> 48:23.232
I was wondering if...

48:23.234 --> 48:24.167
Shh! Not now.

48:24.168 --> 48:25.101
She can't be disturbed.

48:25.103 --> 48:26.869
Mele: It's desperation time.

48:26.871 --> 48:28.738
Nothing but trash out there.

48:28.740 --> 48:30.506
Concentrate.

48:36.147 --> 48:37.313
O goddess hi'iaka,

48:37.315 --> 48:40.283
Ancient mistress of the ocean,

48:40.285 --> 48:42.451
Pioneer surfer chick,

48:42.453 --> 48:45.788
Our forbearer, our guide,

48:45.790 --> 48:48.257
We call your name in...

48:48.259 --> 48:49.592
In the...

48:49.594 --> 48:50.693
Fervent hope?

48:50.695 --> 48:52.495
Good.

48:52.497 --> 48:54.864
Yeah. In the fervent
hope that tomorrow

48:54.866 --> 48:58.267
Will bring us a day
of monstrous surf.

48:58.269 --> 49:01.304
Gia, lanea, mele:
Hi'iaka,

49:01.306 --> 49:02.571
Hi'iaka.

49:02.573 --> 49:03.673
Hi'iaka.

49:03.675 --> 49:04.840
Hi'iaka.

49:04.842 --> 49:06.442
Hi'iaka.

49:06.444 --> 49:07.610
Hi'iaka, hi'iaka...

49:07.612 --> 49:08.612
Kai: Charge!

49:12.216 --> 49:13.916
Lanea: Stop!

49:15.219 --> 49:15.918
Don't run.

49:15.920 --> 49:16.786
Stop! Cut it out!

49:16.788 --> 49:18.554
Give me that, you dork.

49:18.556 --> 49:21.757
Yeah, you think you're funny?

49:21.759 --> 49:23.459
Run!

49:23.460 --> 49:25.160
Yeah, that's what I thought.

49:48.853 --> 49:50.519
I didn't know I was showing off.

49:50.521 --> 49:52.655
I never got a chance
to say thanks

49:52.657 --> 49:54.357
For saving my life.

49:54.359 --> 49:55.491
Hey. I just
got there first.

49:55.493 --> 49:57.293
Gia was right behind me.

49:57.295 --> 49:59.328
We weren't gonna let you drown.

49:59.330 --> 50:01.263
No way.

50:01.265 --> 50:04.834
Hey. I made
something for you.

50:06.704 --> 50:08.304
Don't get too excited.

50:08.306 --> 50:10.573
It's not much, but...

50:10.575 --> 50:12.541
Here.

50:14.979 --> 50:18.414
That's great.

50:19.417 --> 50:20.333
I love it.

50:20.334 --> 50:21.250
Now when you get
back to chicago,

50:21.252 --> 50:22.351
You can show all your friends

50:22.353 --> 50:23.452
What a hot dogger you are.

50:23.454 --> 50:26.789
They'd never buy it,
not a chance.

50:26.791 --> 50:29.859
Would you mind
if I asked you
a big favor?

50:29.861 --> 50:31.293
What?

50:31.295 --> 50:33.329
You know this place?

50:33.331 --> 50:35.364
Yeah. The old
plantation house...

50:35.366 --> 50:36.832
Uh, kaala loa.

50:36.834 --> 50:37.800
It's abandoned now.

50:37.802 --> 50:39.902
Nobody goes up there anymore.

50:39.904 --> 50:41.337
Could you take me?

50:41.339 --> 50:43.305
It's kinda spooky up there.

50:43.307 --> 50:44.740
I don't care.

50:44.742 --> 50:46.359
All right.

50:46.360 --> 50:47.977
But I gotta ask you
one question.

50:47.979 --> 50:51.380
How well do you ride?

52:13.698 --> 52:15.764
Can you imagine
how awesome
it must've been

52:15.766 --> 52:18.100
When this place was happening?

52:18.102 --> 52:19.902
There were major luaus.

52:19.904 --> 52:21.704
My mom talks about them.

52:21.706 --> 52:23.856
On a full moon,

52:23.857 --> 52:26.007
They say you can
hear slack guitars
wailing away.

52:26.010 --> 52:27.393
Oh, right.

52:27.394 --> 52:28.777
Like this place is
haunted or something.

52:28.779 --> 52:29.979
Please.

52:29.981 --> 52:31.780
We could find out.

52:31.782 --> 52:32.815
Next full moon,

52:32.817 --> 52:33.716
Camp up here?

52:33.718 --> 52:36.519
If you're not too scared.

52:36.521 --> 52:37.786
Woooo....

52:37.788 --> 52:39.455
Oh, yeah, cowboy?

52:39.457 --> 52:41.056
Hey, get back here!

52:41.058 --> 52:42.892
Oh, man. Don't
take my hat.

52:42.894 --> 52:44.860
Sydney, catch!

52:45.096 --> 52:46.929
Kona: Hey, where
you going?

52:46.930 --> 52:48.763
Oh, get back here.
Come on, right now.

52:48.766 --> 52:50.866
Go for it, girl.
Run.

52:51.669 --> 52:52.935
All right.

52:52.937 --> 52:54.937
Give me the hat.

52:54.939 --> 52:55.771
No!

52:55.773 --> 52:57.072
Give me the hat!

52:57.074 --> 52:58.040
Get away!

52:58.042 --> 52:59.842
It's my hat!

53:04.916 --> 53:06.715
Oh!

53:07.852 --> 53:09.552
All right.

53:17.128 --> 53:19.595
Gia: What's going on?

53:20.598 --> 53:23.132
I think this was her room...

53:23.134 --> 53:26.435
When she was little.

53:26.904 --> 53:29.838
I think
she showed it
to me once.

53:29.840 --> 53:32.007
Your mom?

53:33.911 --> 53:37.680
I can almost remember...

53:38.149 --> 53:39.815
When she brought me.

53:39.817 --> 53:43.819
I couldn't have been
more than 2, but...

53:43.821 --> 53:46.088
I know I was here.

53:47.191 --> 53:49.575
The smell,

53:49.576 --> 53:51.960
That's what I remember the most.

54:05.910 --> 54:08.744
We wanted you
to see this right away.

54:08.746 --> 54:10.779
Not just hear it
over the telephone.

54:10.781 --> 54:12.715
You must think it's
a pretty fair offer.

54:12.717 --> 54:15.751
James: Tricorp's acquiesced
about everything...

54:15.753 --> 54:20.055
Ecological concerns,
watershed issues.

54:20.057 --> 54:21.590
Everybody gets what they want.

54:21.592 --> 54:24.660
We hope you have your
ivy league college
picked out.

54:24.662 --> 54:27.663
They've given 72 hours
for a response.

54:27.665 --> 54:30.866
We're supposed to
have an answer
that fast?

54:30.868 --> 54:32.918
Bo?

54:32.919 --> 54:34.969
They like to keep
the ball rolling
on these deals.

54:34.972 --> 54:36.639
Can't give you
too much time to think.

54:36.641 --> 54:38.807
James: Actually,
it's a very generous
time frame.

54:38.809 --> 54:41.076
And a very generous offer.

54:41.078 --> 54:43.579
Well, obviously,
you think we
should accept.

54:43.581 --> 54:45.914
No concerns?
It's that good?

54:45.916 --> 54:47.149
Arlene: My honest opinion?

54:47.151 --> 54:48.617
If I were sitting in your place,

54:48.619 --> 54:52.221
I would grab it in a heartbeat.

55:11.208 --> 55:14.276
Hey. What's going on?

55:14.278 --> 55:15.944
Who's out there?

55:15.946 --> 55:18.047
Gia: Sydney?

55:18.983 --> 55:21.650
Gia? What are
you guys doing?

55:21.652 --> 55:24.586
Malia sent us.
She said it's time.

55:25.222 --> 55:27.823
Come on, hurry.

55:52.717 --> 55:54.783
Hey!

55:55.653 --> 55:56.919
Aloha, girls.

55:56.921 --> 55:58.987
Hi.
Hey, mom.

55:59.890 --> 56:02.624
Have fun.
Yeah, we will.

56:04.562 --> 56:06.862
Gia: Come on.
Let's dance.

56:15.940 --> 56:17.339
Hey.

56:25.082 --> 56:27.649
No, come on.
Get back here.

56:31.155 --> 56:33.288
It's good.
Try this.

56:36.827 --> 56:38.894
Yeah, she did it.

57:07.057 --> 57:09.091
Kona, translating:
A long time ago,

57:09.093 --> 57:10.893
In the time
of the double canoes,

57:10.895 --> 57:14.263
There was a girl in nu'alolo.

57:16.634 --> 57:17.800
She was strong...

57:17.802 --> 57:19.368
And graceful...

57:22.773 --> 57:25.841
With firelight in her hair.

57:25.843 --> 57:28.110
She loved a boy...

57:30.915 --> 57:33.348
Who loved her back.

57:35.252 --> 57:39.154
But his father, the king,
demanded a test.

57:42.827 --> 57:45.761
Only if she surfed
the great tsunami...

57:45.763 --> 57:49.231
Could she marry his son.

57:53.904 --> 57:56.004
The boy grew worried.

57:56.006 --> 58:00.275
No one had ever survived
the great tsunami.

58:01.812 --> 58:06.014
The girl knew she had to try.

58:08.152 --> 58:10.719
The meneheunes took pity...

58:11.388 --> 58:13.121
And brought her the branch

58:13.123 --> 58:15.224
Of an iliahi tree.

58:15.226 --> 58:17.693
"its magic will keep you safe,"

58:17.695 --> 58:20.362
The little people told her.

58:20.364 --> 58:23.866
So she paddled into the night
for the giant wave,

58:23.868 --> 58:26.468
Her heart beating fast.

58:26.470 --> 58:30.906
A lei of iliahi flowers
draped around her neck.

58:35.913 --> 58:38.146
Did she survive?

58:51.262 --> 58:53.729
The colors of the rainbow danced

58:53.731 --> 58:56.064
On their wedding day.

58:56.066 --> 58:57.516
Come on! They're here!

58:57.517 --> 58:58.967
Yeah! They're here.
They're here

58:58.969 --> 59:00.802
Come on, the whales!
They're here!

59:00.804 --> 59:01.770
Come on! Come on!

59:01.772 --> 59:04.006
Come on!
The whales are here!

59:18.822 --> 59:20.489
It is magical.

59:20.491 --> 59:23.792
Thanks for letting me
be a part of it.

59:23.961 --> 59:25.027
You know, in the stories,

59:25.029 --> 59:27.195
They say our ancestors
are out there

59:27.197 --> 59:28.847
Watching over us.

59:28.848 --> 59:30.498
And that the whales
move back and forth

59:30.501 --> 59:31.466
Between the two worlds,

59:31.468 --> 59:32.834
Linking one to the other.

59:32.836 --> 59:33.769
That's one of the truths,

59:33.771 --> 59:35.971
Yeah, that we're all connected.

59:35.973 --> 59:39.207
Never alone, that's aloha.

59:45.549 --> 59:48.016
Were you there when it happened?

59:48.018 --> 59:51.253
My mom's accident?

59:53.791 --> 59:56.291
Could you tell me about it?

59:56.293 --> 59:59.294
Do you really want to know?

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:05.167
That day the waves were awesome,

01:00:05.169 --> 01:00:07.302
And naniloa came over,
so excited.

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:10.072
Everything was perfect, so...

01:00:10.874 --> 01:00:12.808
We took the first
rides together,

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.444
Naniloa flying down
these big breakers,

01:00:15.446 --> 01:00:16.812
Cutting back into the curl,

01:00:16.814 --> 01:00:18.547
A huge smile on her face.

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:19.414
That day out there,

01:00:19.416 --> 01:00:20.382
We owned the waves, yeah.

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:22.317
Everything was going perfect.

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:24.987
Then I guess we got tired,

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:27.856
So we were coming in.

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:29.324
I was in front.

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:30.892
And all of a sudden,

01:00:30.894 --> 01:00:34.029
Your mom's board
comes rocketing up.

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:38.166
I looked back, and I see
this huge swell coming,

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:40.569
And the waves stacking
one on top of the other,

01:00:40.571 --> 01:00:43.205
Seeing naniloa trapped
in the middle of it.

01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:44.606
She's caught in this current,

01:00:44.608 --> 01:00:47.175
And it's sweeping her down

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:49.444
Towards the rocks.

01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:53.148
Your father...

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:56.151
Didn't really want
to know what happened.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:57.452
He could barely even listen.

01:00:57.454 --> 01:00:59.321
He just wanted to get away,

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:01.423
And get you out of here.

01:01:01.425 --> 01:01:02.925
It's like...

01:01:02.926 --> 01:01:04.426
He blamed the islands
for losing her.

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:09.031
Your mom fought so hard
in those waves

01:01:09.033 --> 01:01:12.901
To get back to you,
sydney. That's why.

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:17.039
She's supposed to be here
while I'm growing up.

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:19.441
I hate her for not
thinking about that.

01:01:19.443 --> 01:01:23.078
Oh, you have
to forgive her, sydney,

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.447
Both you and your dad.

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:26.281
Why?

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:29.117
For your own sake.

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:03.185
Sydney?

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.158
I left you a note
so you wouldn't worry.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.294
I found it.

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:16.131
Malia brought me back.

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:19.000
I saw.

01:02:19.937 --> 01:02:21.470
You should have
told me about it.

01:02:21.472 --> 01:02:25.574
It shouldn't have been
some deep, dark secret.

01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:51.700
Ben.

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:58.507
I kept thinking...

01:02:58.509 --> 01:03:01.610
That I should have been
there when it happened.

01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:04.980
That I should have saved her...

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:07.249
Stopped her....
Something.

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:09.184
It was an accident.

01:03:09.186 --> 01:03:11.286
Nobody's fault.

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:16.658
When I lost her,

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:20.562
I didn't think I'd
ever love anyone again.

01:03:22.566 --> 01:03:23.598
And then...

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.301
I found you.

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:31.039
It didn't seem fair

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:33.708
That I should be so happy,

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:34.776
And she's...

01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:36.611
Oh, ben.

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:38.445
She would want you to be happy,

01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:40.315
You and sydney,

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:42.484
Us... all of us.

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:45.053
She would want that.

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:17.819
Want to take a walk?

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:21.223
Sure.

01:04:26.163 --> 01:04:28.730
When people ask me
what she was like,

01:04:28.732 --> 01:04:30.565
I make things up.

01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:31.800
Fill in the blanks.

01:04:31.802 --> 01:04:34.836
I have this whole strange
fantasy in my head

01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:36.771
About what she was like

01:04:36.773 --> 01:04:40.742
'cause nobody ever told me.

01:04:42.613 --> 01:04:44.613
What do you want to know?

01:04:44.615 --> 01:04:46.781
Everything.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.087
Sometimes when I looked at her,

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:53.388
It took my breath away.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.507
She was so beautiful

01:04:55.508 --> 01:04:57.625
With this beauty
that came from
the inside, out...

01:04:57.628 --> 01:04:58.760
Radiant,

01:04:58.762 --> 01:05:00.228
Like you.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:01.863
A lot like you.

01:05:01.865 --> 01:05:03.698
You have so much of her.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:04.532
Really?

01:05:04.534 --> 01:05:06.735
She had a natural grace,

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:09.204
The way she moved...

01:05:11.108 --> 01:05:13.341
And the way she laughed.

01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:16.745
I wish I could have known her.

01:05:16.747 --> 01:05:18.513
Me, too.

01:05:20.851 --> 01:05:23.485
Elizabeth and I,
we've been talking.

01:05:23.487 --> 01:05:26.187
About the sale?

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:27.756
I thought I was protecting you

01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:31.126
By getting you away from here.

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:35.230
But malia was right.

01:05:35.232 --> 01:05:37.832
I was just running.

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:40.669
Makai is your heritage, sydney.

01:05:40.671 --> 01:05:43.371
You have to decide
what to do with it,

01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:45.373
What you want.

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:48.810
This decision belongs to you.

01:05:48.812 --> 01:05:50.378
But I'm just a kid.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.448
How am I supposed
to know what to do...

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:55.183
What's right?

01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:57.803
Sometimes you don't know.

01:05:57.804 --> 01:06:00.422
Sometimes you just
have to cross your
fingers and hope.

01:06:00.424 --> 01:06:02.490
What about the money?

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:03.591
I'd be lying to you

01:06:03.593 --> 01:06:05.393
If I told you we didn't need it,

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:06.828
That it didn't matter.

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:08.363
Of course it matters.

01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:09.731
I'll be teaching
the rest of my career

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:13.668
And never I'll never see
this kind of money again.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:14.703
But liz says that

01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:17.272
That isn't always
what's important.

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:19.708
Maybe she's right.

01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:23.511
Anyway, whatever you decide,

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:25.380
We'll be there.

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:27.582
We'll make it work.

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:33.455
Do you think we could stay here?

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:36.191
Live here?

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:40.528
There's lots of lost memories.

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:42.731
Lots of ghosts.

01:06:42.733 --> 01:06:45.200
Maybe that's good.

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:54.302
Sydney: Hi.

01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.040
What's up?

01:08:01.645 --> 01:08:04.712
Are you guys going surfing?

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:05.680
Let's get out of here.

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:07.715
It's beginning to stink.

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:10.318
Yeah, kind of like dead fish.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.853
Over this.
Let's go.

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:13.621
And we're gone.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:17.959
What's the matter
with everybody?

01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:19.327
Why are you acting
like I've suddenly

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:20.361
Got the plague, or something.

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:21.563
I can't believe you're here,

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:22.764
That you'd show your face.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:25.366
Why would you say that?

01:08:33.844 --> 01:08:37.312
But we haven't even
decided anything.

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:49.090
Gia!

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:50.725
Gia!

01:08:52.496 --> 01:08:54.028
Malia!

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:57.799
Anybody home?

01:09:16.353 --> 01:09:18.419
How long have you been there?

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:21.723
I'm looking for gia.

01:09:21.725 --> 01:09:23.491
Not here.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:24.425
Oh.

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:26.528
Well...

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:28.863
Ok.

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:31.166
Are you ok?

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.468
I wasn't sure if you're
still talking to me.

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:35.020
Are you?

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.571
That's kind of what
we're doing now, isn't it?

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:37.971
What's under there?

01:09:37.974 --> 01:09:39.439
What are you working on?

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:41.109
Nothing.
It's nothing.

01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:42.777
Really?

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.381
Maybe I should have asked first.

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:48.850
I mean if you don't like it...

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.984
No, no, it's not that.

01:09:50.987 --> 01:09:52.754
I'm surprised, that's all.

01:09:52.756 --> 01:09:55.456
Malia's been
teaching me to shape,

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:57.091
And I needed the practice,

01:09:57.093 --> 01:09:58.726
It's wonderful.

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:00.528
Thank you.

01:10:03.433 --> 01:10:05.500
Everybody else hates me.

01:10:05.502 --> 01:10:07.835
They think I'm a traitor,

01:10:07.837 --> 01:10:09.837
Scum of the earth...

01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:11.606
Lower, even.

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:13.141
About makai?

01:10:13.143 --> 01:10:14.943
Nothing's even been decided.

01:10:14.945 --> 01:10:16.278
Not yet.

01:10:16.279 --> 01:10:17.612
Kai's betting you'll
grab the bucks and run.

01:10:17.614 --> 01:10:18.813
You should have heard gia

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:21.616
Lay into him for saying that.

01:10:21.618 --> 01:10:22.784
She stood up for me?

01:10:22.786 --> 01:10:24.819
Oh, yeah. Big time.

01:10:33.163 --> 01:10:34.862
Sydney: Gia!

01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:39.934
Hey.

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:43.771
How'd you find me?

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:45.540
Kona.

01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:48.509
He never could keep a secret.

01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:51.012
This is supposed to be
my own private place.

01:10:51.014 --> 01:10:52.680
I come here when
I need time alone.

01:10:52.682 --> 01:10:55.149
You know, when things
are really bugging me.

01:10:55.151 --> 01:10:57.485
I don't know,
something about being here

01:10:57.487 --> 01:10:59.787
Just smooths everything out.

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:02.490
Tell me you don't surf that.

01:11:02.492 --> 01:11:05.660
Malia would have a cow
if she knew.

01:11:06.129 --> 01:11:09.063
Last time, it was my birthday.

01:11:09.065 --> 01:11:10.798
My dad was supposed to call

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.467
From bali or australia,

01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:14.802
Wherever the heck he was.

01:11:14.804 --> 01:11:16.037
He promised.

01:11:16.039 --> 01:11:19.173
And for some dumb reason,
I believed him.

01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:23.511
So, I waited around,
like, the whole day.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.947
But I guess he forgot.

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:26.949
It was my own fault.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:29.884
I mean, I should have known.

01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:32.487
But hey, once you're out there?

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:34.822
All the bad stuff falls away.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.932
Did you read it?

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:47.235
The whole thing?

01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:50.071
Even the part about the whales?

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:51.172
Did you see?

01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:54.709
The lagoon will be a preserve.

01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:56.644
They made them promise.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:59.180
At least we're trying
to keep what's there,

01:11:59.182 --> 01:12:00.114
What's special.

01:12:00.116 --> 01:12:01.582
It's a resort, sydney.

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:03.067
Everything will change.

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:04.551
You think the whales
will keep coming back

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:08.256
Once their lagoon's
filled with tourists?

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.160
When we first met at makai,

01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:14.762
Did you plan it...

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:16.030
You and malia?

01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:17.965
I mean, the inheritance,

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:19.667
Is that why you
became my friend?

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.903
What?! Where'd you
get that?

01:12:21.905 --> 01:12:24.105
The truth, gia.

01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:29.210
Kind of. I mean,
we thought that,
you know,

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:30.545
If you got to know everybody,

01:12:30.547 --> 01:12:32.113
If I accidentally ran into you

01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:34.148
And got things started.

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:35.983
But it changed.

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:40.254
Hey! Sydney,
listen to me.

01:12:40.256 --> 01:12:42.323
Once we got to know each other,

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:44.058
It changed.

01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:45.792
I stopped being
your friend because
I was supposed to,

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:48.996
I just did it
because it was fun.

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:50.465
Listen...

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:51.933
Why? So you can
lie some more?

01:12:51.935 --> 01:12:52.935
It's the truth.

01:12:52.936 --> 01:12:54.352
Boy, you're good.

01:12:54.353 --> 01:12:55.769
Ever consider
going to hollywood,

01:12:55.772 --> 01:12:56.938
Making use of that talent?

01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.272
This isn't an act.

01:12:58.274 --> 01:12:59.640
God, I'm not trying to work you,

01:12:59.642 --> 01:13:00.642
Why would you say that?

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:01.943
'cause that's all I hear.

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:03.244
Lies on top of lies
on top of lies.

01:13:03.246 --> 01:13:05.146
You weren't exactly
telling the truth,
either.

01:13:05.148 --> 01:13:06.914
Pretending to be
some big surfer chick.

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:08.750
I never said I could surf.

01:13:08.752 --> 01:13:09.752
You assumed.

01:13:09.753 --> 01:13:10.952
Oh, I get it.
My lies count,

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:11.819
But yours don't.

01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:14.722
They all knew, didn't they?

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:16.758
You let me make a fool of myself

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.176
In front of everyone.

01:13:18.177 --> 01:13:19.593
You didn't need any
help playing the fool.

01:13:19.596 --> 01:13:21.095
You handled that
all on your own,

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:22.997
Like some stupid lovesick puppy.

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:25.166
Kona?!
Was he in it, too?

01:13:25.168 --> 01:13:27.135
I hate you!
I hate all of you!

01:13:27.137 --> 01:13:28.269
And you know what?

01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:29.737
I am going to sell makai.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:31.139
I'm gonna get off
this stupid island,

01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:33.141
And forget any of you existed.

01:13:33.143 --> 01:13:36.377
Fine! Go back, then.
Who needs you!

01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:40.815
Sydney!

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.920
James:
Everything's ready.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:23.224
Is that for us?

01:14:23.226 --> 01:14:25.860
Well, we thought a little toast

01:14:25.862 --> 01:14:26.794
Might be in order.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.896
It's sparkling cider...

01:14:28.898 --> 01:14:32.066
In honor of sydney.

01:14:34.337 --> 01:14:35.670
Elizabeth:
Thank you.

01:14:35.672 --> 01:14:37.905
Here you go, honey.

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:41.375
Ben: Bo?

01:14:41.377 --> 01:14:43.277
Thank you.

01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:48.216
Sydney.

01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:57.024
James:
To a hard-fought decision,

01:14:57.026 --> 01:14:59.160
And a bright future.

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:01.462
Congratulations.

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:08.903
You all right?

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:11.205
Yeah.

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:12.406
All that's left,

01:15:12.408 --> 01:15:16.377
Is to cross the ts
and dot the is.

01:16:01.324 --> 01:16:02.957
Malia! Gia!

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:04.926
Are you in there?

01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:06.227
Hello!

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:07.295
Sydney?

01:16:07.297 --> 01:16:08.429
I didn't expect to see you.

01:16:08.431 --> 01:16:10.965
I thought you'd be
getting ready to go.

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:12.133
Packing.

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:13.300
I had to tell you myself...

01:16:13.303 --> 01:16:14.335
You and gia.

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:15.368
I mean, there's
still lots of things

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:16.470
To work out, but...

01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:17.772
No, please.

01:16:17.773 --> 01:16:19.073
I don't need to know
the gruesome details.

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:21.909
But I didn't want you
to hear from anyone else.

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.127
No, it's ok.

01:16:23.128 --> 01:16:24.344
You did what you had to.

01:16:24.347 --> 01:16:26.514
There's no need to explain.

01:16:26.516 --> 01:16:28.249
Probably wasn't even fair

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:30.218
What we were asking, yeah?

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:32.186
I mean, you were
so young when you left,

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:33.704
And you've been gone so long,

01:16:33.705 --> 01:16:35.221
How could makai
still be a part of you?

01:16:35.224 --> 01:16:37.825
There's no reason it should be.

01:16:37.827 --> 01:16:40.861
It's just that we thought...

01:16:40.863 --> 01:16:42.930
Maybe.

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:45.299
If you came home...

01:16:48.404 --> 01:16:51.172
And you saw it again

01:16:51.174 --> 01:16:52.273
That it would touch you

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:53.307
And you'd have enough
of your mother

01:16:53.309 --> 01:16:55.543
To feel some
of the things she felt

01:16:55.545 --> 01:16:57.044
About this place.

01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:58.379
It was a shot.

01:16:58.381 --> 01:16:59.814
And at least you've seen it,

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:02.550
And at least now you know.

01:17:02.552 --> 01:17:05.519
You'll have that to keep.

01:17:10.526 --> 01:17:12.493
Here.

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:15.563
Open it.

01:17:22.005 --> 01:17:23.571
Go on.

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:30.478
She'd want you to have it.

01:17:42.425 --> 01:17:44.091
Gia.

01:17:44.427 --> 01:17:46.193
Oh, I thought you were gia.

01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:48.262
Her mom said she was here.

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:49.330
Have you seen her?

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:51.198
No, I haven't.

01:17:52.602 --> 01:17:54.535
She took off.

01:17:55.538 --> 01:17:59.306
Do you know where she went?

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:00.624
Please, kona.

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:01.941
Even if she told you
not to tell,

01:18:01.944 --> 01:18:03.577
It's really important.

01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:06.447
I need to talk to her.

01:18:08.951 --> 01:18:11.919
She said you were
gonna sign the papers
and leave,

01:18:11.921 --> 01:18:14.588
You never wanted
to see us again.

01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:17.091
Any of us.

01:18:17.927 --> 01:18:21.996
Good riddance.
That's what she said.

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:24.165
She was really down,

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:27.635
Like everything
was falling apart.

01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:33.207
Hey.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:34.675
Sydney!

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:49.523
What's going on?

01:18:49.525 --> 01:18:50.608
What's the matter?

01:18:50.609 --> 01:18:51.692
Gia's out there somewhere.

01:18:51.694 --> 01:18:52.927
I know it.

01:18:52.929 --> 01:18:53.561
No way.

01:18:53.563 --> 01:18:55.296
She wouldn't surf alone.

01:18:55.298 --> 01:18:57.465
That's too crazy.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.168
We better find her.

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:03.237
I'll take that way.

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:07.108
Gia!

01:19:12.648 --> 01:19:14.448
Kona: Gia!

01:19:28.664 --> 01:19:30.998
Kona: Gia!

01:19:57.059 --> 01:19:58.626
Gia.

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:01.095
Gia!

01:20:05.067 --> 01:20:06.634
Gia.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.740
Gia!

01:20:12.742 --> 01:20:14.608
Gia!

01:20:32.195 --> 01:20:35.129
Gia, I'm coming!

01:21:00.489 --> 01:21:03.057
Gia!

01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:05.659
Gia, I'm coming!

01:21:17.607 --> 01:21:19.440
Oh, no.

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:43.364
You ok?

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:49.770
What happened?

01:21:50.773 --> 01:21:53.841
Went over the falls...

01:21:53.843 --> 01:21:56.577
And then hit the reef.

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:57.745
My arms hurts a lot.

01:21:57.747 --> 01:22:00.381
Hold on.
I'll get you back in.

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:14.862
Gia!

01:22:14.864 --> 01:22:16.630
Sydney!

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:28.876
You're too late, bra.

01:22:28.878 --> 01:22:31.178
I've already been rescued.

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.613
Oh, yeah?

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:35.749
No more dumb stunts, ok?

01:22:35.751 --> 01:22:36.751
Promise?

01:22:36.752 --> 01:22:38.419
Yeah.

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:49.630
I'll get your towel.

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:51.932
Don't go anywhere.

01:22:58.541 --> 01:23:01.742
I thought you'd be
on a plane by now...

01:23:01.744 --> 01:23:03.377
Long gone.

01:23:03.379 --> 01:23:05.512
Why'd you come back?

01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:08.849
I just want to let you know...

01:23:08.851 --> 01:23:10.918
What I said before,

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:12.619
About hating you,

01:23:12.621 --> 01:23:14.588
Hating this whole place...

01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:17.624
I didn't mean that.

01:23:17.626 --> 01:23:20.260
Me, too.

01:23:20.896 --> 01:23:22.429
About kona...

01:23:22.431 --> 01:23:24.898
What I let you think...

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:25.966
It wasn't true.

01:23:25.968 --> 01:23:27.935
He really likes you, girl.

01:23:28.771 --> 01:23:31.672
Oh, one more thing...

01:23:39.448 --> 01:23:40.614
Ahh... Hey.

01:23:40.616 --> 01:23:41.648
Hey, watch that.

01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:43.951
You all right?
Yeah.

01:23:44.487 --> 01:23:45.786
What is it?

01:23:45.788 --> 01:23:47.521
The contract.

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:50.391
Look, I didn't do it.

01:23:50.393 --> 01:23:51.692
I didn't sign.

01:23:51.694 --> 01:23:52.493
What?

01:23:52.495 --> 01:23:53.660
Don't you get it?

01:23:53.662 --> 01:23:55.229
I told them no.

01:23:55.231 --> 01:23:57.698
We're not selling makai.

01:23:58.667 --> 01:24:01.368
We're gonna live here.

01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:03.937
Gia: Yes!

01:24:03.939 --> 01:24:05.506
Yes!

01:24:05.508 --> 01:24:06.440
Ow!

01:24:06.442 --> 01:24:08.675
Ha ha ha!

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:09.576
Whoo!

01:24:09.578 --> 01:24:10.444
Yes!
Yeah!

01:24:10.446 --> 01:24:12.012
I kept wanting to stay,

01:24:12.014 --> 01:24:14.348
And I am! I am!

01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:15.482
Yeah!

01:24:15.484 --> 01:24:18.652
Have you decided what you'll do?

01:24:18.654 --> 01:24:20.888
Look for a teaching job.

01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:22.689
Finish the novel.

01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:27.795
Maybe open that school
up at the old plantation.

01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:30.930
I guess we're kinda wide open.

01:24:30.933 --> 01:24:34.535
You're not sorry
about turning down
all that money?

01:24:34.537 --> 01:24:35.569
Yeah.

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:36.804
Tsk!

01:24:36.806 --> 01:24:38.172
Ha ha!

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:39.539
That was sydney's choice.

01:24:39.542 --> 01:24:40.941
I'm proud of her.

01:24:40.943 --> 01:24:42.810
I think she did the right thing.

01:24:42.812 --> 01:24:46.447
I'm so glad you guys are here.

01:25:04.366 --> 01:25:07.401
I'm not sure if I'm
saying hello or good-bye,

01:25:07.403 --> 01:25:10.804
But I know she's out here,
watching over me,

01:25:10.806 --> 01:25:13.507
And I know I'll have that,

01:25:13.509 --> 01:25:14.608
Always.

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:16.810
So, either way...

01:25:16.812 --> 01:25:18.545
It's all the same.

01:25:18.547 --> 01:25:21.348
It's all aloha.

01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:29.556
Hey, sydney!

01:25:29.558 --> 01:25:31.692
Whoo!
Over here!

01:25:31.694 --> 01:25:33.427
Hey!

01:25:34.096 --> 01:25:35.529
All right!

01:26:13.135 --> 01:26:14.868
