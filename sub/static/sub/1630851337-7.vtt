I'm so happy to see you.

Thank you so much
for doing this.

02:17.802 --> 02:19.404
You've no idea
what it means to me.

02:19.404 --> 02:21.539
I have grown up worshipping

02:21.539 --> 02:23.441
and studying Kristin.

02:23.441 --> 02:26.578
She has originated some of the
most iconic roles of all time,

02:26.578 --> 02:29.681
and I've been so blessed
to learn from her,

02:29.681 --> 02:32.350
from watching her,
from later on in my life,

02:32.350 --> 02:33.418
being able to work with her.

02:33.418 --> 02:35.153
I still call you
"baby girl,"

02:35.153 --> 02:36.888
but I am your musical mama,
and you know that.
Oh, my God!

02:36.888 --> 02:40.458
So I felt,
who better to bring with me

02:40.458 --> 02:42.927
to this space than the person
who I feel I've learned

02:42.927 --> 02:44.696
the most from professionally?

02:44.696 --> 02:47.332
I will never forget
the first time I met you.
Mm‐hmm.

02:47.332 --> 02:50.201
I was 10 years old, and I came
backstage at "Wicked."

02:50.201 --> 02:53.405
Yes. Your nana said,
"My granddaughter can sing."

02:53.405 --> 02:55.240
You sang,
and that's when I knew.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.708
Oh, God.
I mean, 10 years old.

02:56.708 --> 02:59.444
I remember Kristin
giving me your little wand.

02:59.444 --> 03:01.479
I remember helping you
clean up your dog's pee.

03:01.479 --> 03:04.149
That's when I thought,
"This girl sings and cleans pee.

03:04.149 --> 03:05.650
Man, she's my girl."

03:05.650 --> 03:07.652
Can't wait for you
to meet my team.
I can't, either.

03:07.652 --> 03:10.255
Today's my first battle
rehearsal with my team.

03:10.255 --> 03:11.589
It is so exciting.

03:11.589 --> 03:13.825
I, immediately after the blinds,
started thinking of

03:13.825 --> 03:16.594
which songs and which pairs
I might do.

03:16.594 --> 03:20.699
The first pair of the day
is two amazing women.
Okay.

03:20.732 --> 03:22.634
She's talking
about us right now.

03:22.634 --> 03:25.804
Katie Rae...
Mm‐hmm. ...and Bella DeNapoli,

03:25.804 --> 03:28.506

03:28.506 --> 03:32.310
Two completely opposite,
but diva, big vocals.

03:32.310 --> 03:34.512
And I've given them
the impossible task

03:34.512 --> 03:37.782
of covering "No More Tears
(Enough Is Enough),"

03:37.782 --> 03:39.250
Barbra and Donna.

Yes, and you've done

03:42.520 --> 03:46.558
I had the honor
and soul‐shaking privilege

03:46.558 --> 03:49.227
of singing this song
with Barbra herself.

03:49.227 --> 03:51.162
It's a challenge, but I know
that they can tackle it.

03:51.162 --> 03:52.564
Oh, I can't wait.
Come on in!

03:52.564 --> 03:56.134

Hi!
Oh, my gosh! Come in!

04:02.574 --> 04:04.743
I actually think
I almost passed out

04:04.743 --> 04:08.747
to have not only Ariana Grande,
but Kristin Chenoweth,

04:08.747 --> 04:10.515
'cause I came from
musical theater.

04:10.515 --> 04:12.817
It's like both
of my worlds collided.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.552
Ahh!

04:14.552 --> 04:16.121
Are you dead?
Are you dying?
I'm dying.

04:16.121 --> 04:18.290
Me, too. I know.
I can't even believe it.

04:18.290 --> 04:20.258
Kristin Chenoweth
is the perfect adviser.

04:20.258 --> 04:23.228
She's in everything from
freaking "Glee" to "Wicked."

04:33.338 --> 04:34.739
What I've been doing
for the last three years

04:34.739 --> 04:37.509
is doing all the things
that stay‐at‐home moms do.

04:37.509 --> 04:41.713
And, yes, I do sing
in the shower or in the car.

This is for my baby boy.

I went through kind of
a hard time after having him.

04:55.694 --> 05:01.299
I love a strong, powerhouse,
bad‐bitch vocalist. I'm obsessed.

05:02.567 --> 05:05.704
I had a serious bout
of postpartum depression.

05:05.704 --> 05:09.608
But in a way,
that's what brought me here.

05:09.608 --> 05:13.812
It's kind of what pushed me
to try and find myself again.

05:13.812 --> 05:16.815
And I'm looking forward
to this new chapter in my life.

05:16.815 --> 05:19.250
I haven't stopped thinking
about either of you
since the last time.

05:19.250 --> 05:20.485
Like,
I sound more Italian

05:20.485 --> 05:22.420
when you walk in the room,
by the way.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.322
I'm like, "
Ma, you gotta listen to this."

05:24.322 --> 05:26.291
And I
don't talk like that.
So I don't know why ‐‐

05:26.291 --> 05:27.792
It's okay. My mom was like,
"You really said, 'Holy cannoli'

05:27.792 --> 05:30.829
on live television, Bella?"
Holy cannoli.

05:30.829 --> 05:33.698
The blind audition was crazy.

05:36.668 --> 05:38.703
I could have never imagined

05:38.703 --> 05:41.373
that I would be here
on Team Ariana today.

05:41.373 --> 05:43.308
I moved to New York City
at 18 years old.

05:43.308 --> 05:46.678
I auditioned for a couple
of colleges for musical theater,

05:46.678 --> 05:48.813
but I got rejected
from my top school.

05:48.813 --> 05:50.482
And I automatically was like,
"Nope.

05:50.482 --> 05:51.816
That's not
the right field for me."

05:51.816 --> 05:54.252
So I moved back home
with my parents,

05:54.252 --> 05:57.188
and that might have been
the best thing for me.

05:57.188 --> 06:00.191
They're my huge
support system.

06:00.191 --> 06:02.627
Currently, I perform
with my parents

06:02.627 --> 06:05.263
when I can at local gigs.

06:05.263 --> 06:08.667
I feel like all of the paths
so far has been making me

06:08.667 --> 06:10.802
realize who I am
as a person and an artist.

06:10.802 --> 06:13.171

13:06.351 --> 13:10.155
You know, how you both started
off in this mellower space

13:10.155 --> 13:12.691
and then just powerhouse.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.793
Bella, there was a word
you said ‐‐

13:14.793 --> 13:16.194
I think it was "my"...
Yeah.

13:16.194 --> 13:17.595
...and the way
the vibrato rang and ‐‐

13:17.595 --> 13:20.165
Uh‐huh. It's "my."
Yeah. It was "my."

13:20.165 --> 13:23.301
I was like, oh, my God.
You're crying! She's crying.

13:23.301 --> 13:27.172
Just the way you said the word,
and I was wondering, like,

13:27.172 --> 13:30.442
how would Katie Rae
respond to that?

13:30.442 --> 13:34.145
And, wow, Katie Rae,
my lord,

13:34.145 --> 13:36.815
your tone is, like, so good.
Thank you so much.

13:36.815 --> 13:41.152
The power and that edge and that
rawness in your voice ‐‐

13:41.152 --> 13:42.420
I love it.

13:42.420 --> 13:45.190
It's hard 'cause
she's a new coach and, like,

13:45.190 --> 13:46.524
this is the hardest part
of what we do,

13:46.524 --> 13:50.195
particularly when you two
make it so difficult

13:50.195 --> 13:52.731
by giving such
a powerhouse performance.

13:52.731 --> 13:54.466
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

13:54.466 --> 13:57.435
Yeah, just because
I prefer her tone

13:57.435 --> 14:00.238
just a little more,
I would side with Katie Rae.

14:02.140 --> 14:03.375
That was so rad.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.277
I love the drama
of the beginning.

14:05.277 --> 14:07.279
Like, Bella, you started,
and I was like, "What?!"

14:07.279 --> 14:09.214
It was just ‐‐ Things were just
slipping out of your mouth.

14:09.214 --> 14:10.482
It was just so nice.

14:10.482 --> 14:12.284
Katie, you came in
with that sultry sex.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.586
Like, I‐I literally was like,
"Oh, my gosh."

14:14.586 --> 14:16.588
Like, you bring all this
heavy warmth down here

14:16.588 --> 14:19.324
and the high notes as well,
but you bring all these, like,

14:19.324 --> 14:21.826
piercing,
kind of more pure notes

14:21.826 --> 14:23.762
happening upstairs.

14:23.762 --> 14:26.464
Way upstairs.
And all the ‐‐ I was like,
"Oh, she's ‐‐ that's as high ‐‐

14:26.464 --> 14:28.300
Nope, she's still going."
In the penthouse.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.535
Bella, you're insane,
but there's something

14:30.535 --> 14:33.171
that's super captivating
about that sultry,

14:33.171 --> 14:36.308
like, lower end on you, Katie,
that I really like a lot.

14:36.308 --> 14:38.343
Thank you so much.

14:38.343 --> 14:39.811
I want to talk about Bella
for a minute,

14:39.811 --> 14:41.579
because when
you started the song,

14:41.579 --> 14:45.784
it was almost like a scene from,
like, some old classic movie.

14:45.784 --> 14:47.552
But then
when Katie comes in,

14:47.552 --> 14:51.323
she has such an edgy voice
that you're drawn to that.

14:51.323 --> 14:54.292
But I kept thinking back
to how the song started.

14:54.292 --> 14:57.329
So I'm leaning
towards Bella. Thank you.

14:57.329 --> 14:58.563
Thank you, Coaches.

14:58.563 --> 15:00.298
Ariana, you've got
the final decision.

15:00.298 --> 15:01.800
Give us some thoughts first.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.668
I don't want
to get too emotional,

15:03.668 --> 15:06.471
but I adore you both so much.

15:06.471 --> 15:09.307
You're both so consistently
phenomenal

15:09.307 --> 15:11.443
and, like, there's nothing
to be fixed ever.

15:11.443 --> 15:13.378
Oh, my gosh.
Every single time we ran it

15:13.378 --> 15:15.580
was stunningly perfect.

15:15.580 --> 15:17.616
There's nothing that either
of you can't sing,

15:17.616 --> 15:19.751
and I feel so privileged
to work with you

15:19.751 --> 15:22.787
and to have spent this time
with you both. We love you.

15:24.789 --> 15:25.824
Thank you.

15:25.824 --> 15:27.392
This song
means a lot to me.

15:27.392 --> 15:29.260
My mom and I
would sing it together

15:29.260 --> 15:30.695
in the car all the time,

15:30.695 --> 15:32.731
and hearing it sound like this
is just so special,

15:32.731 --> 15:36.368
and I'm just so proud
of you both and thankful
to work with you.

15:36.368 --> 15:39.237
And, oh, God,
I hate this so much.

15:39.237 --> 15:42.240
I told you it was
gonna happen, girl. I told you.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.175
I literally talked to
my therapist about this.

15:44.175 --> 15:46.578
I was like...

15:46.578 --> 15:49.180
This is a tough one.
Oh, God!

15:49.180 --> 15:51.283
But the time has come.
Oh, my God.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.818
How ‐‐ How do your voice breaks
when you cry is like,

15:53.818 --> 15:56.288
what in the hell? Just stop!

15:56.288 --> 15:58.690
Ari, who is the winner
of this battle?

16:01.760 --> 16:06.598

16:06.598 --> 16:09.901

of this battle is Katie Rae.

Katie Rae,
congratulations.

16:19.577 --> 16:22.280
I love you so much.
Can I hug you?

16:22.280 --> 16:25.517
This was a really
painstaking and tough decision.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.819
I think it was just
a matter of emotion.

16:27.819 --> 16:29.688
Every time
Katie opened her mouth,

16:29.688 --> 16:31.790
I got goose bumps,
but Bella, as well.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.526
Coaches, let me remind
you that Bella's available
to steal or save.

16:34.559 --> 16:37.329
Bella, anything you'd like
to say to your coach?
Oh, no.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.731
Ariana, I never in a million
years would have thought

16:39.731 --> 16:42.300
that I would even
be able to sing in front of you.

16:42.300 --> 16:46.538
And now you're crying
over me. What?!
I love you. That's crazy.

20:12.621 --> 20:14.156
Hey. Hi!
How are you?

20:14.156 --> 20:15.591
So I'm excited
to hear their version of it.

20:15.591 --> 20:16.692
Come over here.

20:16.692 --> 20:19.628
Samuel and KJ ‐‐ their voices
are quite different,

20:19.628 --> 20:22.631
but they're both charismatic
and so engaging.

20:22.631 --> 20:26.335
I'm so excited to hear you two
duet with this song.

20:26.335 --> 20:31.573
And I thought,
who would be the best adviser?

20:31.573 --> 20:36.311
And it's Camila Cabello.
She's here.

20:36.311 --> 20:38.714
Oh, my God!
What?

20:38.714 --> 20:42.451
Hi!
I freaked out!

20:42.451 --> 20:45.220
I mean, I'm singing her song.

20:45.220 --> 20:50.492
Only legendary behavior
allowed. Legendary behavior! Hi!

20:50.492 --> 20:53.362
She has so many hits.
She is such a talented singer.

20:53.362 --> 20:56.498
Every single time she gets
on that stage, she kills it.

20:56.498 --> 20:58.267
I could not believe it was her.

20:58.267 --> 21:00.269
And you're singing
her song!

21:00.269 --> 21:01.770
I don't even know
what to say.

21:01.770 --> 21:03.872
You're singing my first song
from when I was a baby fetus.

21:03.872 --> 21:06.508
And she wrote this with someone
she knows very well,

21:06.508 --> 21:08.677
Shawn Mendes.
I know him kinda well.

21:08.677 --> 21:11.213
And this was the first time
they collaborated.

21:11.213 --> 21:14.283
Shawn and I started writing this
in a dressing room

21:14.283 --> 21:15.817
at Taylor Swift's concert.
Wow.

21:15.817 --> 21:18.320
But what's really interesting
is for the session,

21:18.320 --> 21:21.123
we had me and Shawn
in separate vocal booths,

21:21.123 --> 21:24.092
and we were just kind of
improvising that together.
Cool.

21:24.092 --> 21:25.627
And that is the bridge
that you hear now.

21:25.627 --> 21:27.562
He and I were just kind of
bouncing off each other

21:27.562 --> 21:29.231
for that bridge part.
Wow. That's cool.

21:29.231 --> 21:31.233
Another fun fact is Shawn
could never remember

21:31.233 --> 21:32.901
the words of this bridge.
Oh, wow.

21:32.901 --> 21:34.536
And I would always
make fun of him

21:34.536 --> 21:36.238
because he always
got the words wrong.
Yeah, yeah.

21:36.238 --> 21:37.906
And look what happened
afterwards.

21:37.906 --> 21:39.541
Hey.
The magic happened!

21:39.541 --> 21:42.210
Walked away with more than
a song, if you know what I mean.

21:43.845 --> 21:46.548
When I first heard KJ
sing, I was intimidated.

21:46.548 --> 21:49.284
It made me nervous, and it is
going to be a challenge,

21:49.284 --> 21:52.321
but I'm up for it.
I grew up with a big family,

21:52.321 --> 21:54.523
and I'm one of
five adopted children.

21:54.523 --> 21:57.626
I remember seeing my dad
play in his bluegrass band.

21:57.626 --> 22:00.762
Unbeknownst to me, later on,
had an impact on me

22:00.762 --> 22:02.431
in just wanting to perform.

22:02.431 --> 22:04.733
I taught myself how to play
the guitar and piano,

22:04.733 --> 22:06.501
and it kind of all led up to me

22:06.501 --> 22:08.770
turning into
a full‐time musician

22:08.770 --> 22:10.238
touring around the United States

22:10.238 --> 22:12.307
and playing a lot at breweries,
wineries,

22:12.307 --> 22:14.276
private parties, weddings.

22:14.276 --> 22:16.278
I'm a full‐time dad
at the same time,

22:16.278 --> 22:17.746
and he means everything to me.

22:17.746 --> 22:21.283
The whole motivation
behind my audition song

22:21.283 --> 22:23.452
was just thinking about

That was awesome.

22:49.611 --> 22:52.080
I can't believe we just
sang her song for her.
I know.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.448
The pressure ‐‐ it's real.

22:53.448 --> 22:55.884
I loved it. I thought it was
really, really sick.

22:55.884 --> 22:57.486
And I think in the beginning,
KJ,

22:57.486 --> 22:59.254
I think your falsetto
was really beautiful.

23:11.667 --> 23:13.268
Yes.
...on the chorus.

23:13.268 --> 23:14.770
It kind of, like,
discombobulates the listener.

23:14.770 --> 23:17.673

of what drives its impact

is that little
staccato delivery.
Yeah.

23:25.180 --> 23:26.715
And I'm not naturally
that kind of singer.

23:26.715 --> 23:30.185
I'm more of a soul singer.
I draw my notes out and vibrato

23:30.185 --> 23:31.520
and all these things.
Right. Yep.

23:31.520 --> 23:34.489
But for pop music,
you gotta attack that rhythm

23:34.489 --> 23:35.891
in the right way, okay?
Yeah.

23:35.891 --> 23:38.527
This song is different

I was in high school,

24:17.733 --> 24:20.902
I was doing musical theater
and Shakespeare.

24:20.902 --> 24:22.904
And when I graduated
high school,

24:22.904 --> 24:24.640
I moved to L. A.
with my boyfriend.

24:24.640 --> 24:29.478
So we're songwriting, producing,
and trying to create music.

24:29.478 --> 24:33.148
Samuel, I think you're being

24:33.148 --> 24:34.716
about,
like, really singing.

24:34.716 --> 24:37.119
Yeah.
Just flex a little bit

Alright, I got you.
And ‐‐

24:38.754 --> 24:41.356
Growing up, I was super shy

24:43.225 --> 24:44.760
give my own order
at a restaurant or something.

So, vocally, John telling me
to find time to shine more ‐‐

24:49.364 --> 24:51.366
it's motivating to go back
and, you know,

24:51.366 --> 24:53.335
do the work that I need to do
and find those spots.

24:53.335 --> 24:55.237
You still have to be
a competitor.

24:55.237 --> 24:56.638
I understand.
So show people
you can sing.

24:56.672 --> 24:58.106
Alright, I got you.
I got you, John.
Okay?

24:58.106 --> 24:59.274
Let it ring out,
and also, I think,

24:59.274 --> 25:01.243
feed off of KJ's energy.

25:01.243 --> 25:03.345
Look at her more
and give it back to her.

25:03.345 --> 25:05.480
You know what I mean?
Play out the story more.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.349
Like, she's been cheating,
is what the song's saying.
Yeah.

25:07.349 --> 25:08.650
Be mad!
She's been cheating on you.

25:08.650 --> 25:10.519

bad news

25:10.519 --> 25:12.754
you're being confident about,
it's like you're also assured

25:12.754 --> 25:14.590
that you know what you're
talking about, too.
Yeah, exactly.

25:14.623 --> 25:16.525
And so ‐‐
Like,
I know what you did, girl.

25:16.525 --> 25:18.160
Yeah.
I know.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.328
This was, like,
one of the first songs

25:19.328 --> 25:21.263
that I ever did
as a solo artist.

25:21.263 --> 25:23.498
So to hear people singing it
was really cool.

25:23.498 --> 25:25.734
Feels very hot‐cold,
kind of like pushing away...
Yes.

25:25.734 --> 25:27.536
...but then, "I know
you didn't mean it, though.

25:27.536 --> 25:29.371
Tell me what you did

Yeah.

25:29.404 --> 25:31.340

have the blueprint.

25:35.277 --> 25:36.745

Thank you so much.

25:36.745 --> 25:38.580
This is awesome.
This is crazy.
Great job.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.582
KJ's out there doing it.
She's ringing the notes out.

25:40.582 --> 25:44.152
She's finding moments to put her
individual stamp on the song.

25:44.152 --> 25:45.487
And I want Samuel
to do that, too.

25:45.487 --> 25:47.422

He can do it.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.391

29:01.750 --> 29:03.318
I thought you have
some really cool runs.

29:03.318 --> 29:04.886
I wouldn't have chosen
where you went,

29:04.886 --> 29:06.555
and I love singing
like that.
Thank you.

29:06.555 --> 29:08.190
You're definitely
more pure‐sounding,

29:08.190 --> 29:10.125
and you've got such a rock,
like, edge to you.

29:10.125 --> 29:11.827
Samuel,
it's really cool.
Thank you.

29:11.827 --> 29:13.795
I feel like Shawn has kind of
some rasp in him,

29:13.795 --> 29:15.364
and Camila's more pure.

29:15.364 --> 29:17.199
And I'm curious to know
where you'd go, Samuel,

29:17.199 --> 29:18.834
so I think
I'm leaning that way,

29:18.834 --> 29:20.535
but I thought they both
did a really good job.

29:20.535 --> 29:23.572
Thank you.
Yeah. Thank you.

29:23.572 --> 29:25.574
KJ, you both have
your strengths,

29:25.574 --> 29:27.709
and yours were
in some of the runs

29:27.709 --> 29:29.678
and ‐‐ and the rangy stuff
that you were doing.

29:29.678 --> 29:32.714
But Samuel has that cool,
smoky sound

29:32.714 --> 29:34.349
like you just smoked a carton
of cigarettes

29:34.349 --> 29:36.318
right before you ‐‐
Is that your trick?

29:36.318 --> 29:38.787
Is that what it is?
Which we don't advise.

29:38.787 --> 29:40.355
I think based on that tone,

29:40.355 --> 29:43.525
that's probably where I would
go, is Samuel. Okay.

29:44.760 --> 29:48.630
This is so hard because, Samuel,
I love your tone.

29:48.630 --> 29:50.132
I love your voice.
Thank you.

29:50.132 --> 29:51.533
You had one of my favorite
blind auditions.

29:51.533 --> 29:54.836
And, KJ, I don't know that I was
able to fully appreciate,

29:54.836 --> 29:57.572
based on your blind audition,
what I just saw now

29:57.572 --> 29:58.907
come to life in a new way.

29:58.907 --> 30:02.778
Your runs were so precise,
and I was like,

30:02.778 --> 30:05.347
"Oh, this diva's ‐‐ whoa.
This is a plot twist."

30:05.347 --> 30:07.082
Thank you.
Yes.
I don't know.

30:07.082 --> 30:08.350
I would personally
have to go with KJ, I think.

30:08.350 --> 30:09.785
Thank you.

30:09.785 --> 30:11.787
Thank you, Coaches.

30:11.787 --> 30:13.522
Alright, Johnny,
you got the final decision.

30:13.522 --> 30:17.459
Give us some thoughts.
The wild thing is that this song

30:17.459 --> 30:19.194
was written by Shawn and Camila

30:19.194 --> 30:20.495
as their first‐ever
collaboration

30:20.495 --> 30:21.763
before they were dating.

30:21.763 --> 30:26.168
And the way you all connected,
um... like, the chemistry...

30:26.168 --> 30:28.637
...it was great.

30:28.637 --> 30:30.906
Like, they really enjoyed
performing together.

30:30.906 --> 30:33.375
That's all I want to say.
No pressure.

30:34.443 --> 30:36.545
This is a very
powerful song.

30:37.713 --> 30:42.317
KJ, you have great
vocal technique, amazing runs.

30:42.317 --> 30:46.321
You come here with enthusiasm,
with great energy,

30:46.321 --> 30:49.358
with that big smile.
It's just magnetic.

30:50.692 --> 30:52.861
Thank you.

30:52.861 --> 30:56.732
And, Samuel, you emotionally
invest in the music

30:56.732 --> 30:58.200
that you're singing.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.302
You sing with connection
and passion,

31:00.302 --> 31:04.273
and you asserted yourself
in the song in a way that said,

31:04.273 --> 31:06.842
"Even though I'm singing a duet,
this is also a battle."

31:06.842 --> 31:08.710
So both of you nailed it.

31:08.710 --> 31:12.681
John, who's the winner
of this battle?

31:12.681 --> 31:14.650
The winner
of this battle...

31:19.721 --> 31:21.156
...is Samuel.

31:21.156 --> 31:23.725
Samuel Harness,
congratulations!

31:23.725 --> 31:27.896
You're moving on to the
knockouts on Team Legend.

31:27.896 --> 31:30.232
It was a difficult decision.

31:30.232 --> 31:32.234
I just thought
it'd be better to pick Samuel

31:32.234 --> 31:34.670
because I think his voice
has a little more character

31:34.670 --> 31:36.672
and individuality
and uniqueness.

31:36.672 --> 31:39.574
I'm flabbergasted.
I'm so excited.

31:39.574 --> 31:41.543
Team Legend, baby!
Whoo!

31:41.543 --> 31:44.246
Coaches, let me remind you
that KJ is available to steal.

31:44.246 --> 31:46.548
This has been the honor of
my life to stand on this stage,

31:46.548 --> 31:47.883
and thank you
to all of you.

31:47.883 --> 31:49.351
Wonderful.
Thank you so much.

31:49.351 --> 31:51.520
Give it up one more time
for KJ Jennings,

31:51.520 --> 31:52.821
ladies and gentlemen!

31:52.821 --> 31:55.657
Samuel versus KJ
was a good battle,

31:55.657 --> 31:57.726
but I like to wait
to use my steal

31:57.726 --> 31:59.494
because there's always a battle
that happens

31:59.494 --> 32:03.198
towards the end of these things
that blows people away.

32:03.198 --> 32:05.267
I love her,
and I love him.

32:05.267 --> 32:08.236
That was hard.
He's just different. Yeah.

32:21.350 --> 32:26.761
Who will win this Team Kelly
battle? My heart's shaking.

32:26.761 --> 32:30.564
Will it be the family trio
from Ohio, Girl Named Tom?

32:30.564 --> 32:33.434
I love them.
I'm so jealous.
They're so good.

32:33.467 --> 32:37.004
Ooh. How do I get rid of
this heart pump?
Or the 35‐year‐old
from Nashville,

32:37.004 --> 32:38.939
Kinsey Rose?

32:40.341 --> 32:41.509
Oh!

32:41.509 --> 32:43.811
They're so great!
It's gonna be so good!

32:47.948 --> 32:52.653
Alright, alright,
here we go. Welcome to "La Voix."

32:52.653 --> 32:55.322
For my adviser,
I brought in Jason Aldean.

32:55.322 --> 32:56.924
I love him.
He's a friend of mine.

32:56.924 --> 32:58.559
I'm so happy you're here.

32:58.559 --> 33:00.327
Thanks for having me.
I appreciate it.
I'm so happy.

33:00.327 --> 33:01.962
I thought Jason would be perfect
to help my artists

33:01.962 --> 33:03.731
because if you've seen Jason
perform,

33:03.731 --> 33:06.567
it's like a little bit of rock,
soulfulness, blues, and country,

33:06.567 --> 33:08.502
and he's got a lot
of different kind of flavors

33:08.502 --> 33:11.505
going on in there,
and my team is like that.

33:11.505 --> 33:12.940
We didn't really
know each other

33:12.940 --> 33:14.542
until we sang
"Don't You Wanna Stay?"

33:14.542 --> 33:17.445
And then sometimes
you have magic. Yes, you do!

33:17.445 --> 33:19.547
Biggest duet
that I've done in my career

33:19.547 --> 33:21.515
was the song I did with Kelly,
"Don't You Wanna Stay?"

33:21.515 --> 33:22.783
♪ Don't you wanna stay here?

to a whole different fan base.

33:26.554 --> 33:28.522

my favorite songs ever.

33:28.522 --> 33:29.890
Got us nominated
for a Grammy.

33:29.890 --> 33:31.325
I know.

We should have won.
Whoever won sucks.

33:32.893 --> 33:34.562
I'm just kidding.

33:34.562 --> 33:36.697
I feel very fortunate to
have had the career I've had

33:36.697 --> 33:38.933
and to be able to come and share
some of that knowledge.

33:38.933 --> 33:41.836
Get ready for
every genre of music.

33:41.836 --> 33:43.537
Perfect.
I love it. I love it.
Yes, I know.

33:43.537 --> 33:44.672
I'm excited to be here.

33:44.672 --> 33:46.907
I've always wanted
little brothers and sisters.

33:46.907 --> 33:48.943
If it was me and my sister,

33:48.943 --> 33:51.879
it would not be
as nice as you guys.

33:51.879 --> 33:55.015
When we found out we were paired
with Kinsey, it was like, "Yes!"

33:55.015 --> 33:56.350
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah.

33:56.350 --> 33:57.918
Kinsey's
a great harmonizer,

33:57.918 --> 33:59.920
so she just fits right in.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.789
I have a couple groups
this season.

34:01.789 --> 34:03.524
This is, uh,
Girl Named Tom.

34:03.524 --> 34:05.359
Incredible family harmonies.

34:05.359 --> 34:06.894
Right. Yeah.
It's insane.

34:06.894 --> 34:08.329
They were, like,
a four‐chair turn.

34:08.329 --> 34:09.563
Everybody was like,
"Oh, my gosh."

34:09.563 --> 34:11.665
And then I have Kinsey Rose,
who last season

34:11.665 --> 34:14.535
I blocked Blake for Kenzie,
which is a guy.

34:14.535 --> 34:17.838
And then this season
I blocked Blake for Kinsey,

34:17.838 --> 34:20.708
which is a girl.
And she sings country,

34:20.708 --> 34:22.543
and she kind of has this
really cool voice, too.

34:22.543 --> 34:24.311
I feel like she could
cover a lot of different
kind of artists.

34:24.311 --> 34:26.847
Yeah, let's meet them.
So I'll bring them in. Come on.

34:26.847 --> 34:28.816
Oh, my.

34:28.816 --> 34:31.252
What's up?!
This is Jason Aldean, everybody!

34:31.252 --> 34:34.355
How are you?
I'm Kinsey. Nice to meet you.

34:34.355 --> 34:35.790

I was so excited.

34:35.790 --> 34:37.858
There is a country artist there.

34:37.858 --> 34:40.394
Hey, I love your bar
in Nashville. Oh, thank you.

34:40.394 --> 34:41.896
I've been in Nashville
for 11 years.

34:41.896 --> 34:43.364
I've played up and down
Broadway,

34:43.364 --> 34:44.999
all of the honky‐tonks there.

34:44.999 --> 34:47.968

is primarily what I sing.

34:47.968 --> 34:50.037
Jason has been doing this
for a long time.

34:50.037 --> 34:52.573
He's played for huge audiences.

34:52.573 --> 34:55.409
So can learn a lot
from a guy like Jason.

34:55.409 --> 34:56.944
I was excited
to bring Jason.

34:56.944 --> 34:58.813
We've done a duet together,
so it's kind of the same thing.

and I knew they liked
James Taylor, and I thought,

let's just find something
we can do in the middle.

we'd hit that gravel road,

35:56.337 --> 35:57.872
I could smell the cow manure,

embracing that for this song.

36:34.408 --> 36:35.943

37:52.453 --> 37:54.789
about us arranging
the songs.

37:54.789 --> 37:56.924
We give ourselves
a one‐hour time limit.

37:56.924 --> 37:58.359
Sometimes it works.

37:58.359 --> 37:59.994
Sometimes it's not so great,
but...

37:59.994 --> 38:02.396
♪ Down the seven bridges

38:02.396 --> 38:03.964
I liked it a lot better

38:03.964 --> 38:05.566
when they sort of
stripped it down

38:05.566 --> 38:07.568
and let the vocals kind of stand
out front a little bit more

38:07.568 --> 38:09.470
and shine,
and I was really impressed.

38:09.470 --> 38:11.238
I definitely think
it's gonna be...
Hell yeah!

38:11.238 --> 38:12.807
...one of the most
memorable performances.

38:12.807 --> 38:16.410
It could bring the house down.
Could bring the house down.

38:16.410 --> 38:18.345
Great job!
Thank you so much.

38:18.345 --> 38:20.414
I'm so stoked to see
this performance.

38:20.414 --> 38:23.384
Girl Named Tom and Kinsey
knocked it out of the park.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.953
This decision is gonna be
so tough.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.667
Let the battle begin.

38:39.667 --> 38:42.570
Alright, let's do it. Whoo!

That's Team Kelly!

41:31.038 --> 41:32.807
Okay, Team Kelly.

41:32.807 --> 41:36.610
You four need to be singing
together all the time, you know?

41:36.610 --> 41:37.812
Thank you.

41:37.812 --> 41:39.814
Kinsey, in terms of
winning this show,

41:39.814 --> 41:41.816
you're definitely somebody
I would think about

41:41.816 --> 41:45.386
if I was Kelly because you have
so much character in your voice.

41:45.386 --> 41:48.389
And, by the way, you look like
Hank Williams Sr. up there.

41:48.389 --> 41:51.258
I mean, look at that. That's a
Hank Williams Sr. up there.

41:51.258 --> 41:53.260
Thank you very much.

41:53.260 --> 41:56.330
And then Girl Named Tom ‐‐
together, it was incredible.

41:56.330 --> 41:59.800
But when you stepped out with
that top note towards the end,

41:59.800 --> 42:02.770
your voice is
so freakin' powerful.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.505
You guys are great, too,
but, uh ‐‐

42:04.505 --> 42:06.941
She's the real reason
we're here, so...

42:06.941 --> 42:09.009
No!
They pay me to pick people,

42:09.009 --> 42:10.811
but I don't care.
I'll take a pay cut.

42:10.811 --> 42:13.447
I'm not gonna say.
It's too good.

42:13.447 --> 42:14.782
This was so incredible.

42:14.782 --> 42:16.751
Kelly, you arranged
the hell out of this.

42:16.751 --> 42:21.689
They arranged
that version.
Really? Oh, my God.

42:21.689 --> 42:23.524
It was so great,
so brilliant.

42:23.524 --> 42:25.693
It sounded like
you could be a group,

42:25.693 --> 42:27.661
all four of you,
but also

42:27.661 --> 42:29.630
so incredible individually
as well.

42:29.630 --> 42:34.368
If I had to lean,
I would lean slightly

42:34.368 --> 42:37.605
in the direction
of Girl Named Tom?

42:37.605 --> 42:41.776
That was so inspiring
and beautiful.

42:41.776 --> 42:44.678
This is the kind of thing
people pay lots of money

42:44.678 --> 42:46.514
to experience, you know?

42:46.514 --> 42:48.048
Thank you.
Thank you, yeah.

42:48.048 --> 42:50.251
Musically, I feel a little bit
more connected

42:50.251 --> 42:53.721
with Girl Named Tom,
but I would say Kinsey, to me,

42:53.721 --> 42:55.656
sounded like
the best soloist.

42:55.656 --> 42:59.527
Her tone is just so crisp,
and it's very compelling.

42:59.527 --> 43:01.595
Thank you, Coaches!

43:01.595 --> 43:02.997
Alright, Kelly,
you got the final decision.

43:02.997 --> 43:04.532
Give us some thoughts first.

43:04.532 --> 43:06.901
I'm so proud to say
that you're on my team.

43:06.901 --> 43:09.570
It's just such
a special thing for me.

43:11.238 --> 43:13.274
You know, Girl Named Tom,
I have heard you in rehearsals.

43:13.274 --> 43:16.010
I have heard each of you sing,
and you're incredible.

43:16.010 --> 43:20.815
And, Kinsey, you're the kind of
country singer that I love.

43:20.815 --> 43:22.783
And no one's like you
on the show.

43:22.783 --> 43:24.685
Kelly, the time has come.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.287
Who is the winner
of this battle?

43:26.287 --> 43:27.988
Okay.
We're just getting in there.

43:27.988 --> 43:30.691
And t‐this whole thing is about
strategy sometimes, you know,

43:30.691 --> 43:33.494
so just, we're getting in there,
and I'm just so nervous.

43:33.494 --> 43:35.963
There's gonna be some stealing,
I know this.

43:35.963 --> 43:38.966
I know! I'm nervous which one!
So I'm nervous!

43:38.966 --> 43:43.404
That was all crazy,
what I just did. Um, I'm aware.

43:43.404 --> 43:44.739
Uh, okay.

43:44.739 --> 43:47.007
The winner
of this battle...

43:51.345 --> 43:52.780
...is Girl Named Tom.

43:52.780 --> 43:56.517
Girl Named Tom
is moving on to the knockouts

43:56.517 --> 44:00.688
representing Team Kelly.
So good, so good.

44:00.688 --> 44:02.923
Y'all, Girl Named Tom
and Kinsey Rose ‐‐

44:02.923 --> 44:06.394
like four mics dropped,
and you're welcome.

44:06.394 --> 44:07.962
Great job.
It was so great.

44:07.962 --> 44:11.565
I picked Girl Named Tom
because that family harmony

44:11.565 --> 44:14.935
is so incredible
and it's so tight.

44:14.935 --> 44:17.438
There's just
something special about it.

44:17.438 --> 44:20.741
It's so exciting.
Yeah. I just ‐‐ Waaaaaah!

44:20.741 --> 44:22.610
Coaches, let me remind you
that Kinsey's available

44:22.610 --> 44:23.911
to steal or save.

44:23.911 --> 44:26.547
Kinsey, anything you'd like
to say to Kelly?

44:26.547 --> 44:29.550
Oh, my gosh!
That was fast.

44:29.550 --> 44:31.652
Oh! Whoa!
We got a save,

44:31.652 --> 44:34.555
and John is in
with a steal!

44:34.555 --> 44:40.795
I'm gonna cry.
Should I get in it? Oh, no!

44:40.795 --> 44:44.398
Nooooo!
There's Blake with a steal!

44:44.398 --> 44:46.901
Kinsey, you can go back
to Kelly,

44:46.901 --> 44:49.970
or you can have John Legend,
or you can have Blake Shelton.

44:49.970 --> 44:52.807
You know, I am not the obvious
choice in this situation.

44:52.807 --> 44:55.810
Don't do it! He's doing
the reverse‐psychology thing.

44:55.810 --> 44:59.547
Listen,
I just wanted to honor

44:59.547 --> 45:02.983
how amazing you were to me.
Thank you so much.

45:02.983 --> 45:05.553
I thought you had the best voice
of the group up there,

45:05.553 --> 45:06.787
and you should not be
going home.

45:06.787 --> 45:08.789
I know I can be
a good coach for you,

45:08.789 --> 45:10.791
and I know you deserve
to be here.

45:10.791 --> 45:12.393
That's all I want to say.

45:12.393 --> 45:15.730
Have you ever narrowly escaped
a terrible car accident

45:15.730 --> 45:18.599
where it's like ‐‐
and you look back and you go,

45:18.599 --> 45:23.738
"Wow, wow.
I'll never do that again"?

45:23.738 --> 45:25.940
This is that moment
for you right now.

45:25.940 --> 45:28.509
I'm sorry. Are we saying
picking Kelly Clarkson

45:28.509 --> 45:29.810
is like picking
a car accident?

45:29.810 --> 45:31.679
Oh, my God.
This is your chance
to never make

45:31.712 --> 45:33.380
that horrible mistake
again...
What?!

45:33.414 --> 45:36.751
...even though you didn't even
have a chance...
What?

45:36.751 --> 45:38.786
...the first time around
when Kelly blocked you...

45:38.786 --> 45:40.921
Oh, truth.
...from even
having the chance

45:40.921 --> 45:43.557
to not be
in that horrible car wreck.

45:43.557 --> 45:45.993
She was the person
driving the other car.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.561
Are you okay?

45:47.561 --> 45:50.998
This is your chance
to escape something tragic.

45:50.998 --> 45:53.567
I'd love to be your coach,
Kinsey.

45:53.567 --> 45:56.570
Kel, you're using
your one and only...

45:56.570 --> 45:58.706
I am.
...save against
two steals.

45:58.706 --> 46:02.510
Which is not fair.
Okay, let me explain something.

46:02.510 --> 46:04.545
I did not choose.

46:04.545 --> 46:07.548
I know I had to,
technically.
You. She did not choose you.

46:07.548 --> 46:08.816
No, no, no, no, no.
Yes, yes.

46:08.816 --> 46:11.419
No, no, no.
Like, I was just very nervous,

46:11.419 --> 46:14.789
and so I just picked one.
I want you on my team.

46:14.789 --> 46:16.724
I have a whole list on my notes
on my phone.

46:16.724 --> 46:18.526
I'm so excited
to work with you.

46:18.526 --> 46:19.794
Kinsey,
it is all up to you.

46:19.794 --> 46:22.530
Who do you pick
as your coach? Oh, my gosh.

46:24.999 --> 46:27.601
I don't know!

46:27.601 --> 46:31.372
Shock the world!
Shock the world!

46:31.372 --> 46:33.040
I can't even pick
off of a menu

46:33.040 --> 46:34.375
what I want for dinner.

46:34.375 --> 46:35.776
Like, this is so hard.

46:35.776 --> 46:37.711
Would you like
a Blake burger?

46:37.711 --> 46:39.547
Would you like John...

46:39.547 --> 46:41.415
John's fried chicken.
...salmon?

46:41.415 --> 46:44.351
I want to be fried chicken.
I like fried chicken.
Or Kelly cakes?

46:44.351 --> 46:48.956
Oh, my gosh. Okay.

46:48.956 --> 46:50.958
Can I just say one thing?
I just have to say one thing.

46:50.958 --> 46:54.762
I, too, appreciated
and respect...

46:54.762 --> 46:56.530
Thank you.
That means a lot.
...and adore your voice.

46:56.564 --> 46:58.265
I had to sneak that in there,
not to make it about me.
Thank you.

46:58.265 --> 46:59.700
But like, hello, I'm sitting
here, the only one

46:59.700 --> 47:00.901
without a thing
in front of my seat.

47:00.901 --> 47:02.636
Well, push it!

47:02.636 --> 47:03.704
Aah!
There we go!

47:03.704 --> 47:08.542
We got another steal!

47:11.946 --> 47:15.683
Three steals and a save!
That is a "Voice" first.

47:15.683 --> 47:18.252
Now, this
is good television.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.654
So you've got the burger,
you've got the veggie burger,

47:20.654 --> 47:22.556
you've got the thing,
you've got the thing,

47:22.556 --> 47:24.792
I'll be a turkey burger.
What's for dinner?

47:24.792 --> 47:26.394
Kinsey,
I don't know what to tell you.

47:26.394 --> 47:28.295
I've never seen this on
"The Voice." I'll ask you again.

47:28.295 --> 47:30.564
Thank God we have no more
coaches to press buttons.

47:31.665 --> 47:36.370
Who do you pick
as your coach? Come on, Kinsey!

47:36.370 --> 47:37.671
Come home!

47:37.671 --> 47:40.474
Blake, Blake,
Blake, Blake!

47:40.474 --> 47:42.910
But I love all of you. Aw, man!

47:54.355 --> 47:56.690
Blake, Blake,
Blake, Blake!

47:56.690 --> 47:59.660
But I love all of you. Aw, man!

48:03.931 --> 48:05.533
Kelly saved me twice.

48:05.533 --> 48:08.035
Oh, my God! Are you picking me?
Are you picking me?

48:08.035 --> 48:11.505
Kelly Clarkson...
...has been selected.

48:11.505 --> 48:13.641
Kinsey is staying put!
Oh, my God!

48:13.641 --> 48:16.010
So I'm really happy.
All the seals in the world

48:16.010 --> 48:18.479
could not rip her from my grasp.

48:18.479 --> 48:20.381
Oh, my God.
I'm so excited.

48:20.381 --> 48:23.484
Kinsey ‐‐ her tone
- is like Alison Krauss/
- Dolly,

48:23.484 --> 48:27.021
like this very authentic
country sound that I love.

48:31.225 --> 48:33.027
This is the first time
in "Voice" history

48:33.027 --> 48:36.297
we've had four button pushes
in the battles,

48:36.297 --> 48:39.333
and that just shows you
the power of Kinsey's voice.

48:39.333 --> 48:40.634
I thought you had
a shot, buddy.

48:40.634 --> 48:42.369
It probably didn't help
that my pitch

48:42.369 --> 48:44.371
about the car crash thing

48:44.371 --> 48:46.741
kind of became its own crash
within itself.

48:46.741 --> 48:49.376
That was amazing.
I just ‐‐

48:49.376 --> 48:51.946
Hit your button. Fine.
I had to get in there, man.

48:57.985 --> 49:00.354
Dierks.
Yes?

49:00.354 --> 49:02.490
What was th‐‐
What happened to your hair?!

49:02.490 --> 49:04.358
Where have you been?
Where's yours?

49:04.358 --> 49:06.494
What happened to you?
What are you doing, buddy?

49:06.494 --> 49:08.362
How you been?
What's happening?

49:08.362 --> 49:09.930
Uh, not much.
Glad you're doing this.

49:09.930 --> 49:12.466
Excited to be out here,
you know, seeing your
world a little bit.

49:12.466 --> 49:16.370
I brought in none other than
my old friend Dierks Bentley.

Absolutely.

I think we were born.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.

50:35.916 --> 50:37.618
You know,
when I moved to Nashville,

50:37.618 --> 50:40.955
my first job was I painted
a lady's house

50:40.955 --> 50:43.257
by the name of
Mae Boren Axton.

50:43.257 --> 50:46.260
Her son was a guy
named Hoyt Axton,

50:46.260 --> 50:47.795
who wrote
"Joy to the World."

50:47.795 --> 50:50.798
He got me on his bus one day,
and he sang me "Ol' Red."

50:50.798 --> 50:53.334
That was the first time
I ever sang "Ol' Red."
What?!

50:53.334 --> 50:55.336
Wow.
So I was 18 years old

50:55.336 --> 50:57.772
and already found
what ended up being

50:57.772 --> 50:59.640
possibly my signature song.

50:59.640 --> 51:01.509
I gave Peedy and Joy Reunion

51:01.509 --> 51:03.377
"Joy to the World"
by Three Dog Night,

51:03.377 --> 51:04.945
and I think
this is a perfect song

51:04.945 --> 51:06.647
because it's a vintage throwback,

51:06.647 --> 51:09.984
which is great for Peedy,
and it's also from a band,

51:09.984 --> 51:13.354
a trio, and that's perfect
for Joy Reunion.

51:13.354 --> 51:14.622

Jeremiah.

I'm 19 years old.
Wow.

51:23.330 --> 51:25.866

for a long time, and I was like,

She did the whole Nashville
scene back in the '90s,

to her dream,

58:48.626 --> 58:49.994
Give us some thoughts first.

58:49.994 --> 58:52.197
Joy Reunion, just how smooth
and ‐‐ and flawless

58:52.197 --> 58:55.900
and ‐‐ and pitch‐perfect
y‐your harmonies are together,

58:55.900 --> 58:58.203
it's clear that you guys
have been working together

58:58.203 --> 58:59.804
for a long time.

58:59.804 --> 59:01.673
And then on the other hand,
what the hell, Peedy?

59:01.673 --> 59:03.274
There's no way
to put your finger on it.

59:03.274 --> 59:08.713
That's just a‐a gift, man.
And I'm happy for you. Yeah.

59:08.713 --> 59:11.249
Blake, who is the winner
of this battle?

59:16.187 --> 59:20.158
Uh...

59:20.158 --> 59:24.262
...the winner of this battle
is Peedy. There you have it!

59:24.262 --> 59:26.297
That was a great battle.

59:26.297 --> 59:29.834
I love The Joy Reunion.
But Peedy is just special.

59:29.834 --> 59:32.637
Definitely think Peedy
has not only a chance

59:32.637 --> 59:34.038
of winning this thing,

59:34.038 --> 59:36.741
but he has a chance
of some kind of a crazy career

59:36.741 --> 59:39.010
when this thing is over, also.

59:39.010 --> 59:40.779
This is just
a very surreal moment,

59:40.779 --> 59:42.680
and I'm so thankful
to be going forward.

59:42.680 --> 59:43.982
It's very, very exciting.

59:43.982 --> 59:46.117
Watch out, knockouts!
Whoo!

59:46.117 --> 59:47.852
Coaches, let me remind you
that Joy Reunion

59:47.852 --> 59:49.154
is available to steal.

59:49.154 --> 59:50.688
Guys, what would like
to say to your coach?

59:50.688 --> 59:52.257
We kind of viewed Peedy
as a son,

59:52.257 --> 59:54.159
and I'm kind of
damn proud of him, you know?

59:54.159 --> 59:55.994
Aww!
We feel really proud
of him. We love him.

59:55.994 --> 59:57.729
So, thank you, guys.
Thank you.

59:57.729 --> 59:59.998
Give it for The Joy Reunion!

59:59.998 --> 1:00:02.801
As great as The Joy Reunion
and their harmonies are,

1:00:02.801 --> 1:00:05.804
it was hard to really get
a sense of their identity.

1:00:05.804 --> 1:00:08.006
I think Kelly had the most
four‐chair turns this season,

1:00:08.006 --> 1:00:12.210
so I'm definitely looking at
her team for a possible steal.

1:00:12.210 --> 1:00:13.978
I like Peedy.

1:00:13.978 --> 1:00:15.947
I could not take
my eyes off of whatever ‐‐
No.

1:00:15.947 --> 1:00:17.282
I was like,
"Well, what?!"

1:00:17.282 --> 1:00:18.950
Yeah.
That's what I was saying.

1:00:18.950 --> 1:00:20.118
It's like I don't even know
what's going on around here.

1:00:20.118 --> 1:00:21.219
It's, like,
whimsical in a way.

1:00:21.219 --> 1:00:22.620
It's so different.

1:00:22.620 --> 1:00:23.888
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1:00:36.083 --> 1:00:38.819
I can't believe
how far you've come,

1:00:38.819 --> 1:00:40.988
and for you to invite me,
thank you,

1:00:40.988 --> 1:00:43.857
because you know
how much I love young talent,

1:00:43.857 --> 1:00:47.194
and you are who
they look up to so much.

1:00:47.194 --> 1:00:50.197
Because you're who
I look up to most.
Full circle.
Like, it makes me want to cry.

1:00:50.230 --> 1:00:52.933
Okay.
It's very exciting.
Okay, it's Chavon and David.

1:00:52.933 --> 1:00:55.102
They're gonna sing "Sugar, We're
Goin' Down" by Fall Out Boy.

1:00:55.102 --> 1:00:57.538
Fall Out Boy, yes! Me too.
Very excited about this.

1:00:57.538 --> 1:00:59.340
There they are.

1:00:59.340 --> 1:01:01.108
Not this gasp in unison.

1:01:02.343 --> 1:01:03.410
Even on‐pitch.

1:01:03.410 --> 1:01:05.379
Hi!
Hi!

1:01:05.379 --> 1:01:09.984
How are you guys?
Whoa! What's up?

1:01:09.984 --> 1:01:12.186
Super cool to walk in
and see Kristin Chenoweth.

1:01:12.186 --> 1:01:14.888
Just to have that perspective
is really cool

1:01:14.888 --> 1:01:17.958
'cause she's done so much,
from TV to Broadway

1:01:17.958 --> 1:01:19.893
to, you know, really everything.

1:01:19.893 --> 1:01:21.028

It's so cool to meet you.
Where y'all from?

1:01:24.098 --> 1:01:26.867
I'm from New York.
Yes, I love New York,
obviously.

1:01:26.900 --> 1:01:29.103
Oklahoma.
Okay, so,
that's my birthright.

1:01:29.103 --> 1:01:31.939
It's absolutely
insane to be here

1:01:31.939 --> 1:01:33.841
to have made it past the blinds.

Welcome!
Thank you!

1:01:42.416 --> 1:01:44.618
Back in Tulsa,
I am a court clerk,

1:01:44.618 --> 1:01:48.188
which basically just means
I file papers all day.

1:01:48.188 --> 1:01:50.924
While I am extremely thankful
for my job,

1:01:50.924 --> 1:01:54.194
it can become
incredibly monotonous.

1:01:54.194 --> 1:01:56.230
I would love to create
a career out of music,

1:01:56.230 --> 1:01:59.033
and I think this opportunity
is what I needed.

1:01:59.033 --> 1:02:01.935
I tried to find something that
would be right for both of you,

1:02:01.935 --> 1:02:04.471
and I thought that since you
share the common ground

1:02:04.471 --> 1:02:06.240
of singing pop songs

1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:08.208
and making them
rock interpretations,

1:02:08.208 --> 1:02:11.879
why not find a rock song
that was a huge pop smash?

1:02:11.879 --> 1:02:14.915
It's definitely home for me.
It's like nostalgia.

1:02:14.915 --> 1:02:17.151
I grew up
in that pop punk genre.

1:02:17.151 --> 1:02:20.120
I remember going up in my room
and playing this song on drums,

1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:22.923
just like,
you know, rocking out.

1:02:22.923 --> 1:02:25.926
I'm in a band with my
best friends and my brother.

1:02:25.926 --> 1:02:28.896
We play New York City a lot.
It's a good time.

1:02:28.896 --> 1:02:30.831
For my blind audition,
I sang "breathin"

1:02:30.831 --> 1:02:32.232
by Miss Ariana Grande.

1:02:32.232 --> 1:02:34.368

♪ Am I more than

1:02:48.215 --> 1:02:51.118
Ariana chose a really good song
for the both of us.

1:02:51.118 --> 1:02:53.988
It's kind of a departure from
what I would typically sing,

1:02:53.988 --> 1:02:56.223
but I'm ready to,
you know, push myself.

I know this is
a competition.

1:03:22.116 --> 1:03:25.386
Ariana.
It didn't feel like
you were fighting or competing,

1:03:25.386 --> 1:03:28.422
which is really annoying,
'cause you have to stay forever.

1:03:28.422 --> 1:03:30.024
Everyone has to stay

I love your cool vibe.
You're cool.

And you cool, Oklahoma.
But I would just concentrate

I should not speak about
enunciation, because when

1:04:00.154 --> 1:04:02.890
I'm singing pop music,
it sounds like another language.

1:04:02.890 --> 1:04:05.459

Oh, my God! That was awesome!
Thank you, man. Whoo!

1:08:59.629 --> 1:09:01.964
That was really,
really good.

1:09:01.964 --> 1:09:05.568
Chavon, you have such a strong
voice and a cool tone.

1:09:05.568 --> 1:09:06.836
My only concern with you

1:09:06.836 --> 1:09:08.671
is a little bit
on the pronunciation.

1:09:08.671 --> 1:09:11.274
I feel like you can be
a little more clear.

1:09:11.274 --> 1:09:14.877
What I loved about David
was that clarity.

1:09:14.877 --> 1:09:17.814
Your tone is really, like,
appropriate for the genre.

1:09:17.814 --> 1:09:21.651
And like, I could hear a record,
I could hear you on the radio.

1:09:21.651 --> 1:09:23.286
It just connected for me.

1:09:23.286 --> 1:09:27.690
And so I would side
with David. Thanks, John.

1:09:27.690 --> 1:09:29.826
That was literally
one of my favorite battles.

1:09:29.826 --> 1:09:32.295
Like, I love that song so much,
I wore it out.

1:09:32.295 --> 1:09:33.863
I'm still wearing it out.
Honestly!

1:09:33.863 --> 1:09:36.165
I think you both bring something
different to the table.

1:09:36.165 --> 1:09:38.868
David, like, you do have a lot
of clarity in the high note,

1:09:38.868 --> 1:09:39.869
so it's really cool.

1:09:39.869 --> 1:09:41.637
You know, Chavon,
cool name.

1:09:41.637 --> 1:09:44.307
David is cool, too.
Very biblical, solid.

1:09:44.307 --> 1:09:46.609
But ‐‐ But Chavon
I've never heard.
Solid.

1:09:46.609 --> 1:09:48.678
And, Chavon,
you have more of a low end,

1:09:48.678 --> 1:09:51.647
but your voices, like, melted
perfectly together.

1:09:51.647 --> 1:09:53.049
I don't know who to pick.

1:09:53.049 --> 1:09:55.885
I mean, just because he picked
David, I'll go with Chavon.

1:09:55.885 --> 1:09:56.753
Just had to contradict me.

1:09:56.753 --> 1:09:58.988
Yeah, I just want
to disagree with you.

1:09:58.988 --> 1:10:00.189
Okay.

1:10:00.189 --> 1:10:01.824
Chavon may have
the cooler name,

1:10:01.824 --> 1:10:04.160
but David has
the way cooler hair.

1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:06.996
I mean, Look at that. I don't
know what's gonna happen,

1:10:06.996 --> 1:10:10.233
but there's definitely a shampoo
commercial in your future.

1:10:10.233 --> 1:10:12.869
It was just such
a good performance

1:10:12.869 --> 1:10:14.203
and just a good blend.

1:10:14.203 --> 1:10:15.838
It was almost like
watching a band.

1:10:15.838 --> 1:10:19.008
I don't really have any things
that I could point to

1:10:19.008 --> 1:10:21.744
from a vocal standpoint.
I guess if I had to pick,

1:10:21.744 --> 1:10:23.780
I mean, I got to vote
for my Ada, Oklahoma, guy.

1:10:23.780 --> 1:10:25.681
So I'm gonna say
Chavon also.

1:10:25.681 --> 1:10:29.218
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Coaches.

1:10:29.218 --> 1:10:32.321
Ari, you got the final decision,
but give us some thoughts first.

1:10:32.321 --> 1:10:36.759
This is so unimaginably
hard for me.

1:10:36.759 --> 1:10:38.661
I was so looking forward
to this performance

1:10:38.661 --> 1:10:40.096
that for the past week,

1:10:40.096 --> 1:10:42.298
I've been playing this song
in the car on repeat,

1:10:42.298 --> 1:10:49.872
but, like, singing your ad libs
in my head. And I... Mm!

1:10:49.872 --> 1:10:52.642
...love and care about you both,
and you're both so talented.

1:10:52.642 --> 1:10:54.110
Chavon, I love that low end
in your voice.

1:10:54.110 --> 1:10:57.714
I love that tone and how it
complements the guitar.

1:10:57.714 --> 1:10:59.816
David, I love your tone as well.
I hear what they're saying.

1:10:59.816 --> 1:11:02.785
It belongs on pop radio
like today,

1:11:02.785 --> 1:11:07.890
and it's so hard because
you're both too damn talented.

1:11:07.890 --> 1:11:10.727
I wish I had another save.

1:11:10.727 --> 1:11:13.663
But nonetheless, I'll be fans
of you both and stalking you

1:11:13.663 --> 1:11:15.264
and coming to your shows
for like a long time.

1:11:15.264 --> 1:11:16.833
You're gonna be like,
"She's here again?"

1:11:16.833 --> 1:11:18.735
And I'm gonna be like,
"Yeah, I'm here again."

1:11:18.735 --> 1:11:20.570
Then I'm gonna be like,
"Hi, can you sign my shirt?"

1:11:20.570 --> 1:11:22.739
Anyway...
Tough decision for you.

1:11:22.739 --> 1:11:24.340
Who is the winner
of this battle?

1:11:28.611 --> 1:11:34.884
The winner of this battle...
...is David.

1:11:34.884 --> 1:11:38.354
David Vogel is moving on
to the knockouts!

1:11:38.354 --> 1:11:39.856
Congratulations!

1:11:39.856 --> 1:11:43.359

Chavon and David are my boys.

1:11:43.359 --> 1:11:45.094
I love them so much.

1:11:45.094 --> 1:11:49.565
I think that just in this
context, David was more present.

1:11:49.565 --> 1:11:51.567
I can hear him on pop radio
right now.

1:11:51.567 --> 1:11:53.736
I think he cut through
slightly more.

1:11:53.736 --> 1:11:56.305
Coaches, let me remind you that
Chavon is available to steal.

1:11:56.305 --> 1:11:57.774
Chavon, anything
you want to say?

1:11:57.774 --> 1:11:59.776
Thank you so much
for seeing something in me

1:11:59.776 --> 1:12:01.811
and for taking me along
for this ride.

1:12:01.811 --> 1:12:03.746
I love you, and I'm very
appreciative of you.

1:12:03.746 --> 1:12:05.281

Thank you.

Give it up one more time
for Chavon Rodgers,

1:12:10.053 --> 1:12:12.221

Aww!

He didn't see you!
He didn't see you.

1:12:21.564 --> 1:12:23.766
I'm heartbroken
no one stole Chavon,

1:12:23.766 --> 1:12:27.970
but Kelly swooped in
and gave me the best hug.

1:12:27.970 --> 1:12:29.338
That broke my heart!

1:12:29.338 --> 1:12:31.274
Guys, are you sure
he didn't see me?

1:12:31.274 --> 1:12:33.876
In his defense,
you're incredibly tiny.

1:12:33.876 --> 1:12:36.612
Coming up,
the final battle of the night

you were gonna come out here

off the place.

through the roof.

Thank you so much.

1:21:44.452 --> 1:21:48.156

was the heart

1:21:48.156 --> 1:21:50.358
that I felt
coming from both of you.

1:21:50.358 --> 1:21:53.794
Jeremy, your voice has
this silkiness to it

1:21:53.794 --> 1:21:56.097
and range
that is ridiculous.

1:21:56.097 --> 1:21:58.966

so tight and so precise.

1:22:07.175 --> 1:22:09.143
Most people cannot do it.
Thank you.

1:22:09.143 --> 1:22:10.978

for me.

1:22:10.978 --> 1:22:14.348
You are soulful
and you are a damn good singer.
Thank you.

1:22:14.348 --> 1:22:18.686

1:22:20.888 --> 1:22:22.323
Alright, Kelly,
give us some thoughts

1:22:22.323 --> 1:22:25.893
before you have to make
this tough decision. Aw, man.

1:22:25.893 --> 1:22:28.930
There's like two amazing
powerhouse vocalists

1:22:28.930 --> 1:22:30.798

to choose from now.

1:22:30.798 --> 1:22:32.133
You both elevated
each other,

1:22:32.133 --> 1:22:34.235
and I thought that was kind
of cool and magical.

1:22:34.235 --> 1:22:36.470
Jeremy, hands down,
I remember in rehearsals

1:22:36.470 --> 1:22:38.272
I was like, "Is he singing
the high part?"

1:22:38.272 --> 1:22:40.341
And honestly, Jershika,
you sang low stuff.

1:22:40.341 --> 1:22:42.276
That's why it was crazy,
y'all are such ‐‐

1:22:42.276 --> 1:22:44.378
Your ranges are so incredible.
To be able to create that blend

1:22:44.378 --> 1:22:46.447
is such a sign
of a great artist.
Yes.

1:22:46.447 --> 1:22:49.150

hearts in the world as well.

1:22:49.150 --> 1:22:51.018

to say to your coach?

1:23:56.851 --> 1:23:58.286
And the hat.
And the shoes.

1:23:58.286 --> 1:24:01.055
The way you owned the stage
and you just lit it up.

1:24:01.055 --> 1:24:02.757
And the belt.
You know, you lit it up.

1:24:02.757 --> 1:24:06.661
Yes, she's reciting all
the things she loves
about your outfit.

1:24:06.661 --> 1:24:07.962
Oh, this is gonna be
so hard!

1:24:07.962 --> 1:24:09.363

runs happen flawlessly.
