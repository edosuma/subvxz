WEBVTT

00:05.673 --> 00:07.459
There we go.

00:08.092 --> 00:10.674
Well, Shelby, what do you say
we call it a night?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.459
Shelby?

00:13.097 --> 00:15.429
Your friend Chloe's gonna be here
any minute.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.766
Any minute.
Thanks for your help, buddy.

00:23.107 --> 00:24.313
Shelby?

00:31.323 --> 00:33.530
Shelby, what is it? Shelby?

00:49.425 --> 00:51.666
What's wrong, boy?
Do you see something I don't?

01:00.811 --> 01:03.644
Clark.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.305
Earth to super-freak.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.817
Everyone, please, sit down.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.693
Are you still with us, Clark?

01:23.625 --> 01:25.161
What's going on?

01:25.335 --> 01:27.997
Well, you said that you and your dog
were in the barn...

01:28.172 --> 01:30.379
...when you heard something.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.718
And then you left us for a bit.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.553
What are you talking about?

01:44.021 --> 01:45.227
How'd I get here?

01:45.397 --> 01:48.480
So, what attacked you?
Was it a krypto-freak again?

01:52.863 --> 01:56.572
No, I know, it was a spirit
from the Phantom Zone, right, Kal-El?

01:56.742 --> 01:59.324
-How do you know that name?
-You never shut up about it.

01:59.495 --> 02:02.407
-0 great son of Jor-El.
-Settle down, gentlemen.

02:02.581 --> 02:03.787
Wait, back off.

02:03.957 --> 02:08.667
Take it easy, Clark. Take those deep
breaths we talked about.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.041
Who are you?

02:12.716 --> 02:16.254
It's me, Dr. Hudson.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.715
I don't wanna have to hurt anyone.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.725
Why don't you use your speed and run?

02:37.574 --> 02:39.030
Why are you doing this to me?

02:39.201 --> 02:41.658
What do you want? What's happening?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.740
Let me go!

02:43.914 --> 02:45.620
Let me go. Please.

02:46.542 --> 02:50.126
Someone. Why am I here?

03:42.097 --> 03:45.214
Let me out of here.
I don't belong in here.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.344
I'm not crazy.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.605
I don't belong here.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.030
Back away from the door.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.487
Back away from the door!

04:14.546 --> 04:15.706
How did I get here?

04:15.881 --> 04:19.749
Think back, Clark.
You know how that happened.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.794
Someone or something attacked me
in my barn.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.760
This is 33.1.

04:31.939 --> 04:35.352
It's Lex. He's always wanted
to get me under his microscope.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.652
I'm afraid your obsession
with Lex Luthor...

04:37.819 --> 04:40.526
...is part of the fantasy world
that you created...

04:40.697 --> 04:43.734
...after you experienced
your psychotic break.

04:44.368 --> 04:47.531
Oh, I get it.
You want me to think I'm crazy.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.912
Well, we prefer not to use pejoratives.

04:51.500 --> 04:56.540
You suffer from paranoid schizophrenia.
You have for a number of years.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.834
After the death of your birth parents
in the Smallville meteor shower.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.128
See, it's not true.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.139
My birth parents were out of town
for the meteor shower.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.676
You were placed in the wonderful
adoptive home of the Kents.

05:13.730 --> 05:17.894
But like many children,
you invented a make-believe world...

05:18.068 --> 05:21.356
...to help you deal
with the trauma you endured.

05:22.114 --> 05:25.402
You convinced yourself
that you came from another planet.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.315
That you possessed special powers.

05:28.495 --> 05:32.738
And you use them to save humanity.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.830
Whatever you're trying to do,
it's not gonna work.

05:38.922 --> 05:42.915
An active imagination wasn't a problem
when you were a boy.

05:43.093 --> 05:46.677
But when you entered your freshman
year at high school...

05:47.014 --> 05:50.427
...you slipped permanently
into your fantasy world.

05:52.102 --> 05:55.094
If you're gonna play mind games,
you gotta try harder.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.854
This isn't a game, Clark.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.312
You're sick.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.102
And your condition is getting worse.

06:04.698 --> 06:10.489
But the good news is, l have developed
a new treatment that will cure you.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.495
Tell Lex that I don't buy it.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.282
Lex isn't your nemesis.

06:17.461 --> 06:21.750
And 33.1 doesn't exist.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.793
For the last ﬁve and a half years...

06:24.968 --> 06:28.756
...you've been a resident
of the Fairview Psychiatric Hospital.

06:35.395 --> 06:40.264
Everything else:
Your superpowers, your alien lineage...

06:40.442 --> 06:42.649
...your secret identity...

06:44.321 --> 06:46.027
...it's all a delusion.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.501
Hey. Stop licking the ball. It's cheating.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.047
Time for medication.

07:14.226 --> 07:18.014
Lick the ball, so the ball doesn't bounce
properly. And not to mention....

07:18.730 --> 07:21.221
All right, let's go.
Keep on moving. Keep on moving.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.018
That means you too.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.731
Let's go.

07:32.327 --> 07:35.535
Don't hide that pill under your tongue.
Swallow it.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.708
You're not crazy, Kal-El.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.036
We don't have much time
so listen to me closely.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.752
I believe you're from another planet.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.587
What makes you say that?

07:50.762 --> 07:55.552
Because like you, I'm not from here.
I come from Mars.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.216
You can't trust anyone--

07:59.396 --> 08:00.385
Hey.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.475
Don't even think about it.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.575
Mom? Mom?

09:09.799 --> 09:11.790
Clark, you're home.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.002
I can't believe it.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.723
What are you doing here?

09:36.117 --> 09:38.574
What are all your things doing in the loft?

09:38.745 --> 09:41.862
Clark, this is my home now.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.204
After your dad passed away, Nell
and I bought the farm from your mom.

09:50.173 --> 09:54.166
Not everything has changed.
I kept this.

09:54.678 --> 09:57.841
You once said that looking through it
brought me closer to you.

09:59.683 --> 10:04.973
And having it here makes me feel like
you're always with me.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.931
I don't understand.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.694
I know. This must be really hard for you.

10:14.656 --> 10:18.194
You've been gone a long time
and a lot has changed.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.990
But none of that matters anymore.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.740
Freshman year, you promised me
that we would never be apart.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.620
And you were right.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.588
We weren't dating then.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.505
You were with Whitney.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.592
The football jock?

10:42.350 --> 10:47.219
Clark, there's only one person
I've ever been in love with.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.387
You.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.601
It's okay. The doctor said
that you'd suffer...

10:54.779 --> 10:56.770
...mild amnesia after the treatment.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.277
What treatment?

11:01.870 --> 11:04.031
I didn't have any treatment.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.452
But you were released from the hospital.

11:10.587 --> 11:14.205
I wasn't released. I escaped.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.331
Lex Luthor put me in that hellhole.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.131
Lex didn't put you in there.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.921
No. It's not right.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.806
I don't care if you two are engaged,
stop protecting him.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.805
I hardly know Lex Luthor.
I'm gonna call the hospital.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.313
No. Stop.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.766
You're lying.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.604
You're in on this. Aren't you?
He sent you here.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.774
That's why you're here,
to distract me until he shows up.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.282
Please, stop.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.740
What did Lex do with my mother?
Where is she?

11:49.084 --> 11:53.578
She's probably at the mansion.
The Luthor mansion.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.547
Clark?

12:05.558 --> 12:06.764
Mom?

12:08.812 --> 12:10.973
Thank God, you're okay.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.264
Oh, Clark. Oh, I've been a wreck all day.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.979
Everyone at the hospital
is so worried about you.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.987
-You knew I was in that place?
-Dr. Hudson called Lionel...

12:22.158 --> 12:25.116
...the moment you disappeared.
They've both been looking for you.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.151
Lionel?

12:29.499 --> 12:33.242
He must be in on it. He must've told
Lex the truth about me.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.456
Clark, please. Try to calm down.

12:36.548 --> 12:39.210
Calm down? Mom, you don't understand.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.840
They put me in that asylum.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.468
-They took away my powers.
-No, sweetheart.

12:44.639 --> 12:45.970
It'll be all right.

12:46.141 --> 12:50.384
Mom, we have to get you out of here.
We have to get you away from Lionel.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.223
No, Clark.

12:53.690 --> 12:56.352
Lionel and l are married now.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.780
I meant to tell you,
but I was afraid of how you'd react.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.818
-How could you?
-He's a good, decent man.

13:07.996 --> 13:11.204
Lionel's made sure you've gotten
better care than I could ever afford.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.910
-Oh, he's been lying to you--
-No.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.871
Clark, Dr. Hudson's treatment
will make you well again.

13:16.045 --> 13:19.412
-Please, I just want my son back.
-No. You're coming with me right now.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.331
No, no, l--

13:28.641 --> 13:30.632
They're drugging you too.

13:32.395 --> 13:35.137
Clark, those are my allergy pills.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.146
-What are you doing?
-You need help, Clark.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.486
Mom, you don't understand
what's going on.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.201
-You're coming with me.
-No.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.357
-Right now.
-No.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.913
Come on. Mom. They want you--?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.581
Please, don't hurt him.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.949
Stop!

14:33.790 --> 14:35.621
There's nowhere to run, Mr. Kent.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.119
Just relax and put your hands
behind you.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.871
-Chloe, how'd you ﬁnd me?
-Are you kidding me?

15:21.045 --> 15:23.502
I've been in GPS mode ever since
my contact lM'd me...

15:23.673 --> 15:25.755
...about the breakout this morning.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.841
Look, I can't stay here.
I don't wanna get you involved.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.923
I already am.
Think you're the only one...

15:31.097 --> 15:33.634
...who's life's been turned upside down
by the Luthors?

15:33.808 --> 15:35.344
I've been ﬂying under the radar.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.305
-Chloe, they're after me, not you.
-They're after both of us.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.642
Now, don't ditch the sidekick
until you get your powers back.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.556
You may need me to cover you.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.645
I'm glad to see you, Chloe.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.357
I was beginning to think
I was actually losing it.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.613
Chin up. Once we get this
on the front page...

15:50.783 --> 15:54.196
...father and son Luthor are gonna
be wearing matching orange jumpsuits.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.531
Lex. I gotta go see him.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.446
Wait a minute.
You just got out, Clark.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.581
You're gonna go back
into the devil's lair?

16:00.752 --> 16:03.710
-Lex is more dangerous than ever.
-Even more reason to stop him.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.872
You don't have your powers.
You'd get hurt like everyone else.

16:07.050 --> 16:10.634
Powers or no powers,
I won't let him do this to me.

16:14.891 --> 16:18.475
All right, ﬁne, since your superspeed's
out of gas, take my Yaris.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.101
Be careful.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.356
Surprised to see me?

16:35.244 --> 16:37.621
My father said you were out.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.831
I just never thought you'd have
the nerve to show your face.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.243
You may have taken my powers, Lex,
but I'm not afraid of you.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.412
And I won't let you ruin my life.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.748
Your life?

16:53.680 --> 16:56.422
I think you have that a little backwards.

16:57.767 --> 17:01.760
Did you forget our little run-in
on the Loeb Bridge ﬁve years ago?

17:04.190 --> 17:07.933
When you save someone's life,
you tend to remember.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.984
You really think you saved me.

17:15.326 --> 17:19.239
Well, then, let me refresh your memory.

17:35.263 --> 17:39.131
I have to spend the rest of my life
in this chair because of you.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.971
This is impossible.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.763
-l was there--
-And you caused the accident.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.774
Oh, you claimed you saw my car
swerving out of control...

17:49.944 --> 17:53.857
...so you jumped in front of it
to save me with your superpowers.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.528
But when I jerked the wheel,
my Porsche ﬂipped end over end...

17:57.702 --> 17:59.408
...and wrapped around the guardrail.

18:00.538 --> 18:01.698
That's not what happened.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.364
If it was up to me,
you'd be rotting in jail.

18:05.501 --> 18:09.210
But my father insisted you go
to that mental hospital instead.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.960
Anything to impress Martha Kent
with his kindness.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.468
This is a trick. It's a trick.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.253
Really?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.383
Open your eyes,
you crazy son of a bitch!

18:25.813 --> 18:27.599
Does this look like a trick to you?

18:37.825 --> 18:40.692
If there's one thing I regret in my life...

18:41.746 --> 18:44.328
...it's that I didn'tjust run you over.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.732
Clark.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.322
I knew you'd come here to see Chloe.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.737
What happened to the coffee house?

19:28.251 --> 19:30.537
Clark, this has been
an abandoned movie theater...

19:30.711 --> 19:32.702
...for as long as I can remember.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.539
No, this doesn't make sense.

19:38.261 --> 19:40.343
This can't be real.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.760
Lana, Lex said that...

19:49.438 --> 19:51.850
...I caused his accident. Is that true?

19:53.484 --> 19:55.645
That's all in the past now.

19:56.696 --> 20:00.860
Clark, come back to the farm with me.
We can get through this.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.365
We can get through anything.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.827
None of this makes sense, Lana.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.785
And you and I,
we're not together anymore.

20:11.294 --> 20:15.082
Ever since kindergarten
we've been together, Clark.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.552
I thought that this would help you
to remember.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.845
It's from the gumball machine
at Quinn's Market.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.645
You gave it to me
when we were 10 years old.

20:32.815 --> 20:36.182
You said that it was my wedding ring.

20:38.446 --> 20:42.109
And when you put it on my ﬁnger,
and kissed me for the ﬁrst time...

20:42.283 --> 20:44.490
...that's when you stole my heart.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.243
I don't remember.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.412
You suffered so much in that hospital.

20:54.795 --> 20:58.788
Every weekend when I'd come to visit,
I could see it in your eyes.

21:00.217 --> 21:03.175
I never gave up hope
that you'd get better.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.891
I don't know what's going on.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.561
But Chloe does.
She knows who I am.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.685
Clark, you shouldn't see her right now.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.444
-Chloe?
-C|ark, thank God.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.197
-What's going on?
-We have to get out of here right now.

21:25.368 --> 21:26.858
Lex and his men took everything.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.402
They're trying to wipe me
off the face of the earth.

21:29.580 --> 21:30.865
No. Lexis in a wheelchair.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.407
Clark, when it comes to the Luthors,
you can't trust anything. Okay?

21:34.585 --> 21:37.201
We gotta go subterranean
until you get your powers back.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.541
Chloe, I'm not so sure.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.707
Nothing's the way it's supposed to be.
It all seems so crazy.

21:42.885 --> 21:43.920
We're not crazy.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.630
We're not crazy. We're just
the only two that know the truth.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.346
That's why they put us
in the mental institution.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.223
I tried to tell you.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.393
What's she doing here?

22:01.570 --> 22:04.232
Chloe was in Fairview with you.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.318
You were in that place too?

22:08.536 --> 22:10.572
They put me in that snake pit
to shut me up.

22:10.746 --> 22:14.034
-She has a family history of mental illness.
-Don't listen to her, Clark.

22:14.208 --> 22:17.826
-She's just trying to confuse you.
-C|ark, please, just come with me.

22:18.921 --> 22:21.037
And I'll get you the help that you need.

22:36.439 --> 22:39.226
I should've known you'd never be able
to resist her.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.812
You never could.

22:44.030 --> 22:47.022
If she's here,
it means they're not far behind.

22:50.953 --> 22:53.786
Chloe, hold on. Just stay here
and we'll ﬁgure this out.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.912
There's nothing to ﬁgure out, Clark.

22:56.083 --> 22:59.996
I know who you really are, and they're
gonna kill me for it. I have to go.

23:02.506 --> 23:03.916
Mr. Kent, just take it easy.

23:18.731 --> 23:22.394
Chloe? Chloe.

23:23.778 --> 23:24.893
Chloe.

23:28.157 --> 23:31.445
Clark. I'm not crazy.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.155
No.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.368
No.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.831
Chloe?

23:44.340 --> 23:45.796
Chloe?

23:53.974 --> 23:56.056
This can't be real.

23:57.103 --> 24:01.096
Chloe didn't die. No. She couldn't have.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.520
I'm sorry, Clark.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.811
I know how much you cared
about your friend.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.530
What the hell do you want from me?

24:12.701 --> 24:14.987
For you to have a happy, healthy life.

24:15.162 --> 24:18.495
And it will become a reality
after this treatment.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.537
I'm not gonna go through with it.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.334
I know who I am.

24:24.505 --> 24:26.336
I'm not sure you do.

24:28.384 --> 24:32.718
Your name is Clark Kent, not Kal-El.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.388
And Jor-El...

24:36.725 --> 24:38.590
...isn't your father.

24:50.823 --> 24:55.692
Dr. Fine. Dr. Milton Fine,
please report to level three, stat.

24:55.870 --> 25:00.409
When the human mind is faced
with tremendous emotional pain...

25:01.250 --> 25:03.957
...it has no choice but to protect itself.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.337
You've taken bits and pieces
of your surroundings...

25:08.507 --> 25:12.216
...and created an alternate universe
where you feel safe and secure.

25:13.387 --> 25:14.752
Clark...

25:16.140 --> 25:18.973
...in a world where you truly
had no power...

25:19.143 --> 25:21.930
...you chose to give yourself
superpowers.

25:45.628 --> 25:47.459
-Good morning, doctor.
-Good morning.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.835
That'll be all, Raya.

26:06.315 --> 26:10.524
This is a piece of meteor rock
from Smallville.

26:11.362 --> 26:13.978
No, it's all right, Clark.

26:17.451 --> 26:19.567
It can't hurt you.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.452
It's not what you call kryptonite.

26:25.376 --> 26:27.458
It's just a rock.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.673
Chloe...

26:32.424 --> 26:34.460
...really is dead.

26:41.809 --> 26:43.549
I'm sorry, Clark.

26:44.895 --> 26:46.886
I'll get the treatment ready.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.717
You can't give in, Kal-El.

27:23.434 --> 27:27.143
You must resist. None of this is real.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.309
-Leave me alone.
-Listen to me.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.223
When you were attacked in the barn...

27:33.402 --> 27:36.644
...you were infected by a being
you released from the Phantom Zone.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.108
The Phantom Zone doesn't exist.

27:39.283 --> 27:40.693
Yes, it does.

27:42.619 --> 27:44.029
And if you were a human...

27:44.997 --> 27:48.364
...that spirit would have taken
you over with ease...

27:48.542 --> 27:51.124
...like Zod did with Lex Luthor.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.160
But you're a lot stronger than that.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.082
You're Kryptonian.

27:58.093 --> 28:01.210
You're a patient in a mental hospital.
You're just as crazy as I am.

28:01.388 --> 28:05.757
If you give in to Hudson
and undergo this treatment...

28:05.934 --> 28:09.017
...the entity will gain control
of your body with all its powers...

28:09.188 --> 28:12.271
...and unite the other fugitives
from the Phantom Zone.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.897
Together, they'll enslave all of mankind.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.402
If this is all in my head,
then how are you here?

28:18.572 --> 28:21.188
I'm in your mind as well, trying to help.

28:22.076 --> 28:25.819
But there's only one way to purge this
parasite and regain your consciousness.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.823
You have to kill Hudson.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.541
Kill Hudson?

28:35.672 --> 28:37.583
-I can't kill a man.
-He's not a man.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.252
Hudson's a phantom.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.128
You told me not to trust anyone.
Why should I trust you?

28:44.765 --> 28:46.301
You know who you are, Kal-El.

28:46.475 --> 28:48.807
Trust yourself.

28:53.816 --> 28:56.273
Well, if it isn't our little
visitor from Mars.

28:58.737 --> 29:04.027
Look within. Believe in yourself.
The future of mankind depends on it.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.032
What's the matter there, freak?

29:10.207 --> 29:14.075
You scared of a little ﬁre?
Isn't Mars the red-hot planet?

29:14.253 --> 29:15.413
Welcome home.

29:18.465 --> 29:19.875
Get him out of here.

29:24.471 --> 29:26.382
It's time, Mr. Kent.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.689
I didn't want you to go
through this alone.

29:41.864 --> 29:44.526
Dr. Hudson said I could come.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.862
We're so close, Clark.

29:48.245 --> 29:51.157
You're gonna get better,
and we can ﬁnally be together.

29:51.331 --> 29:53.458
Like we were always meant to be.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.742
I want you to be real.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.795
I am real.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.551
Okay.

30:07.681 --> 30:11.048
Let's say that I am a hallucination...

30:11.935 --> 30:14.893
...and that your world really does exist.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.981
I'm about to marry
your greatest enemy...

30:20.486 --> 30:22.568
...and you're an alien
from another planet...

30:22.738 --> 30:25.821
...who's responsible
for so much tragedy.

30:30.746 --> 30:34.238
Do you really wanna live in that reality?

30:35.375 --> 30:37.331
I don't know what to believe anymore.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.586
Wouldn't you just wanna take this
treatment and be with me?

30:41.757 --> 30:44.089
Of course I wanna be with you.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.547
More than you could ever imagine.

30:47.721 --> 30:51.339
Then stop ﬁghting, please.

30:52.726 --> 30:57.595
You've lived like this for so long,
carried this burden of being a hero.

30:57.981 --> 31:02.896
It's time to just let go
and live a normal life.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.607
I've never been normal.

31:05.781 --> 31:10.024
Your destiny isn't to save
the world, Clark.

31:11.411 --> 31:16.246
It's to be with me
for the rest of our lives.

31:35.477 --> 31:39.561
There's no need to be afraid, Clark.
The procedure's quite painless.

31:56.999 --> 31:58.864
It'll be over in the blink of an eye.

32:28.905 --> 32:29.940
Shelby?

32:33.410 --> 32:35.696
-l'm still in the barn.
-Settle down, son.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.743
I know who I am.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.785
Just relax, Mr. Kent, please.

32:53.513 --> 32:56.050
Stop it. You're having another episode.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.806
Think about Lana.
You could be together at last.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.566
Get out of my mind.

33:32.552 --> 33:33.632
It's you.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.757
Welcome home, Kal-El.

33:43.605 --> 33:44.720
Clark?

33:50.654 --> 33:52.019
Clark, are you all right?

33:55.909 --> 33:57.319
Hey.

34:04.835 --> 34:06.791
-Shelby.
-Hi.

34:06.962 --> 34:08.748
Thanks, buddy, you saved my life.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.394
You're sure I was only
out for a second?

34:30.152 --> 34:32.359
I was walking from my car
when I heard you fall.

34:32.529 --> 34:34.986
By the time I got to the barn,
you were on your feet.

34:35.157 --> 34:37.739
It felt like a lifetime.

34:39.327 --> 34:40.988
I gotta give the phantom props.

34:41.163 --> 34:44.326
Dangling the Lana carrot
is a pretty tempting offer.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.585
But he clearly has never come
across the steel will of Clark Kent.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.166
Chloe, you don't understand.

34:55.510 --> 34:59.594
I almost gave up everything
and everyone that I care about...

35:01.600 --> 35:03.181
...for Lana.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.476
Wait a second.

35:06.646 --> 35:11.436
Based on the pending nuptials,
I thought Lana was past-tense.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.191
So did I.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.983
The truth is, I still love her.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.917
I guess kryptonite's
not your only weakness.

35:35.383 --> 35:38.295
So who was I in your alternate universe?

35:38.470 --> 35:41.177
Editor in chief of the Daily Planet...

35:42.432 --> 35:45.344
...or a Pulitzer Prize winner maybe?

35:49.731 --> 35:51.562
Something like that.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.312
The important part is...

35:57.072 --> 35:59.688
...you were the one person
who believed in me.

36:06.206 --> 36:08.743
I don't know what I'd do
without you, Chloe.

36:09.793 --> 36:12.830
Oh, is this when I'm supposed to cue
the Barry Manilow music?

36:13.004 --> 36:15.086
No, seriously.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.712
You mean a lot more to me
than you know.

36:59.342 --> 37:01.549
You look like you've got something
on your mind.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.882
It's that obvious?

37:05.765 --> 37:08.552
You don't hide your feelings
as well as you think.

37:10.312 --> 37:11.677
How are you doing?

37:12.564 --> 37:14.475
-I mean with your--
-Fine.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.436
Yeah, everything's ﬁne.

37:17.611 --> 37:19.226
Good.

37:21.156 --> 37:23.363
So are you gonna tell me?

37:25.327 --> 37:27.613
What was that look in your eye?

37:32.500 --> 37:34.582
I had a dream about you last night.

37:36.880 --> 37:40.043
-I hope that it wasn't a nightmare.
-No.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.422
We were 10 years old
and I gave you a plastic ring...

37:44.596 --> 37:47.212
...from a gumball machine
at Quinn's Market.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.722
That's sweet.

37:51.728 --> 37:54.219
What was the occasion?

37:55.607 --> 37:57.222
It was an engagement ring.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.145
What happened next?

38:07.661 --> 38:09.492
I woke up.

38:16.336 --> 38:17.496
Lana.

38:21.174 --> 38:24.211
I should've guessed your delay
wasn't the herbal tea.

38:30.850 --> 38:31.930
Clark.

38:34.104 --> 38:36.436
It's good to see you out and about, Lex.

38:38.233 --> 38:41.475
You know, you actually sounded
convincing when you said that.

38:42.237 --> 38:43.852
I appreciate the civility.

38:47.075 --> 38:48.940
You ready to go?

38:49.119 --> 38:51.451
We don't wanna keep
the wedding planner waiting.

38:51.621 --> 38:53.703
Yeah, we were just saying goodbye.

39:49.012 --> 39:51.003
[ENGLISH]
