00:02.802 --> 00:04.401
People keep reporting a woman

00:04.436 --> 00:07.473
shaking their bed, saying,
"Help me! Help me!"

00:07.508 --> 00:08.840
Are you shaking the bed?

00:08.875 --> 00:12.779
Everything was fine,
and then a train hits her.

00:12.814 --> 00:14.612
****

00:14.647 --> 00:17.648
Worst experience of my life.

00:17.683 --> 00:19.752
It's almost like it was
just walking away from us,

00:19.787 --> 00:20.852
like it had enough.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.256
I don't think she knows
she's dead.

00:25.124 --> 00:28.727
When the dead are forgotten,
they become restless.

00:28.728 --> 00:29.929
My God!
You just touched me.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.264
What?
I did not touch you.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.964
I'm Amy Bruni.

00:32.999 --> 00:35.966
A haunting encounter redefined my life.

00:36.001 --> 00:39.705
I live with that experience
and seek answers to the unknown.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.407
It says, "I am."

00:41.442 --> 00:43.108
I'm Adam Berry.

00:43.109 --> 00:46.312
At Gettysburg, the shadows
and screams of dead soldiers

00:46.347 --> 00:48.448
turned me
into a supernatural believer.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.048
My God!

00:50.083 --> 00:53.385
Together, our investigations
bring peace to the living...

00:53.420 --> 00:55.553
You can't scare us.
You can't deter us.

00:55.554 --> 00:57.388
...by giving a voice
to the dead.

00:57.423 --> 01:00.559
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
What is your name?

01:00.594 --> 01:03.696
Because we believe the dead
and the living are all...

01:03.731 --> 01:06.065
...kindred spirits.

01:10.369 --> 01:12.003
So, my friend Kate
and her husband Joe,

01:12.038 --> 01:15.208
they have this beautiful home
that's very historic.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.574
I was reading up on it.

01:16.609 --> 01:19.228
This house has been
in existence --

01:19.263 --> 01:21.812
I think it was built
in like 1750.

01:21.847 --> 01:24.916
It's a really large house.
There's a lot of rooms.

01:24.917 --> 01:27.218
They've only had it
for a year.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.320
When I spoke to Kate,
she was talking about

01:29.355 --> 01:33.593
how there was a moment
where something rushed at her.

01:33.628 --> 01:35.559
They have a son
that's two years old,

01:35.594 --> 01:41.300
and she will not leave
her kid in a room by himself.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.300
It sounds like
she is worried...

01:43.335 --> 01:47.004
...because the haunting
seems a little violent. -

01:47.039 --> 01:48.639
- When something
like that happens... - Yep.

01:48.674 --> 01:50.242
...you're
constantly on edge,

01:50.277 --> 01:51.811
waiting for it
to happen again.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.344
Here it is.

01:55.881 --> 01:57.314
- Hey, Kate.
- Hi.

01:57.349 --> 01:58.600
Hi. Good to see you.

01:58.635 --> 01:59.817
- Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.

01:59.852 --> 02:01.921
No worries.
Thank you for having us.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.354
I know we talked briefly...

02:03.389 --> 02:04.856
...about the activity
that's been happening. - Yeah.

02:04.891 --> 02:07.558
- It's gotten worse.
- It has?

02:07.593 --> 02:08.824
Well, do you want
to take us around

02:08.860 --> 02:11.530
and kind of show us
what's happened and where?

02:11.565 --> 02:12.630
So, this room right here,

02:12.665 --> 02:14.750
this is where my husband
and I sleep.

02:14.785 --> 02:16.835
This is the
Cornelius Crocker bedroom.

02:16.836 --> 02:20.171
It's named after the man
who built this house.

02:20.206 --> 02:23.976
The building was constructed
in 1754 by the Crocker family,

02:23.977 --> 02:25.611
one of the most prominent
families

02:25.646 --> 02:27.811
in pre-Colonial Massachusetts.

02:27.846 --> 02:30.732
Originally a stagecoach stop
and tavern,

02:30.767 --> 02:33.584
it was converted
into a museum in 1927,

02:33.619 --> 02:37.188
only to become a residential
home in the late 1990s.

02:37.223 --> 02:40.593
A few months after Kate moved in
and began making renovations,

02:40.628 --> 02:42.929
the terrifying activity started.

02:42.964 --> 02:45.196
Tell us what
happened in here.

02:45.231 --> 02:47.364
So, it started with
my son in a Pack 'n Play

02:47.399 --> 02:50.134
next to the bed, and I was
just about to fall asleep,

02:50.169 --> 02:54.573
and I saw a figure running
towards me and towards the baby.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.941
I said, "Stop!
No! No, no, no."

02:56.976 --> 03:00.078
- My heart was racing.
It felt...threatening. - Right.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.579
And I have my child here.

03:01.614 --> 03:03.399
That's what scared me
most was my baby's here.

03:03.434 --> 03:05.184
Well, at the moment,
you probably thought it was...

03:05.219 --> 03:06.817
...a live person coming at you.
- Yeah.

03:06.852 --> 03:08.921
I was
absolutely terrified.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.955
Then, a few nights later,

03:10.990 --> 03:12.991
I hear somebody
going up the stairs,

03:13.026 --> 03:14.993
walking into
the bedroom above us.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.060
I woke up my husband.

03:16.095 --> 03:17.396
I was like,
"Somebody's in the house."

03:17.431 --> 03:18.597
So he jumps out of bed.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.116
He went into
every single room,

03:20.151 --> 03:21.599
under the bed, every closet --
- Yeah.

03:21.634 --> 03:23.670
...looking,
and he didn't see anything.

03:23.705 --> 03:25.870
Wow!

03:25.871 --> 03:27.771
Most of the activity's upstairs.

03:27.806 --> 03:29.540
- So let's go that way.
- Yeah.

03:29.575 --> 03:31.142
So, besides the footsteps,

03:31.177 --> 03:33.112
what other activity
has happened up here?

03:33.147 --> 03:34.278
Okay, so in here,

03:34.313 --> 03:35.915
this is where my cousin Sharon
was sleeping,

03:35.950 --> 03:38.084
and the bed starts shaking.

03:38.119 --> 03:39.049
Okay.

03:39.084 --> 03:40.435
Then, a few nights later,

03:40.470 --> 03:41.752
it keeps getting crazier.

03:41.787 --> 03:44.589
- Two of my cousins were
locked inside this room... - Wow.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.056
...for about 15 minutes,

03:46.091 --> 03:47.860
and all of a sudden,
it opened.

03:49.295 --> 03:51.429
My mother has heard things

03:51.430 --> 03:53.532
across the hallway
in Aunt Lydia's room.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.099
- Let's go to Aunt Lydia's room.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:55.134 --> 03:56.501
And did you name
the rooms, or did --

03:56.502 --> 03:57.603
No, they came named.

03:57.638 --> 03:58.669
They came named.

03:58.704 --> 04:00.204
So, who is Aunt Lydia?

04:00.239 --> 04:02.907
- So, Aunt Lydia is the daughter of
Cornelius Crocker... - Okay.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.375
...and she was a widow.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.045
Her husband died
after they were married

04:06.080 --> 04:07.346
for just
a couple of years.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.281
Do you know if she passed
away in this house or --

04:09.316 --> 04:11.648
- She did. Yes.
- She did.

04:11.683 --> 04:14.720
So, in here, my mother
has heard somebody screaming

04:14.755 --> 04:17.053
"Help me" clear as day.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.226
My mother has felt people
watching her from this door

04:20.261 --> 04:23.363
over here and from
that door in this room.

04:23.398 --> 04:24.328
Weird.

04:24.363 --> 04:27.166
So this is where
the center of it is.

04:27.201 --> 04:28.433
Okay.

04:28.434 --> 04:31.203
And you had said there were
some strange objects...

04:31.238 --> 04:32.803
...you found while renovating?
- Yeah.

04:32.838 --> 04:34.071
Okay, so this was a shoe

04:34.106 --> 04:36.508
that was found in the wall
upstairs in the attic.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.911
That's a thing, you know.
They did that on purpose.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.943
- They did?
- Yeah.

04:39.978 --> 04:41.512
It was considered
good luck.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.649
They would leave a shoe in the
wall when they built a house.

04:43.684 --> 04:47.285
So, honestly, this could be
as old as this house.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.787
- Guessing this was somebody's mirror
on someone's dresser. - Yeah.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.522
Yeah, for sure.

04:51.557 --> 04:52.990
Where did you find this?

04:53.025 --> 04:56.227
I found that upstairs in one
of the bedrooms, actually.

04:56.228 --> 04:57.613
You were
finding these things

04:57.648 --> 04:59.441
when you first
moved in, right?

04:59.476 --> 05:01.199
And then
the activity started?

05:01.234 --> 05:05.070
It definitely has picked up
since I've moved stuff around.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.806
You feel the energy
in the house change

05:06.841 --> 05:08.439
just even talking about it.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.240
You know,
it's entirely possible

05:10.275 --> 05:13.346
that moving those objects
triggered the activity.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.812
We've seen that
in other cases,

05:14.847 --> 05:18.116
but we'll have to find a way
to confirm it while we're here.

05:18.117 --> 05:19.316
At the end of this
investigation,

05:19.351 --> 05:21.821
what do you hope for us
to accomplish for you?

05:21.856 --> 05:24.355
I will happily coexist
with any spirit

05:24.390 --> 05:27.226
that's happy or fine with
our occupation of the house,

05:27.261 --> 05:29.526
but if it's a bad ghost,
it's got to go. -

05:29.561 --> 05:31.095
I have a kid.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.997
- We need to work and make sure
it's safe for you guys. - Yes.

05:34.032 --> 05:36.201
Yeah, figure out who it is
and why they're here.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.336
Let's start bringing stuff in
and just get to it.

05:38.371 --> 05:42.373
And you can go to the hotel
while we do our investigation.

05:42.374 --> 05:43.792
We will report back to you.

05:43.827 --> 05:45.211
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

05:49.548 --> 05:51.949
Investigating
a 300-year-old house

05:51.984 --> 05:55.721
and all the people connected
to it will be a huge challenge.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.691
I'm gonna take this camera
up to Aunt Lydia's room.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.726
The fact that Aunt Lydia
died in the house

06:00.761 --> 06:01.925
makes her a good candidate

06:01.960 --> 06:04.830
for who might be causing
the unexplained activity,

06:04.865 --> 06:06.966
but why would she be
rushing at Kate

06:07.001 --> 06:08.366
or calling out for help?

06:08.401 --> 06:10.686
Adam, I think the
cameras are good,

06:10.721 --> 06:12.972
so why don't we
start investigating.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.575
Amy and I plan to start
our investigation

06:16.610 --> 06:18.710
where the activity
has been most physical --

06:18.711 --> 06:19.810
the guest bedroom.

06:19.845 --> 06:21.981
This is where people
have felt the bed shaking

06:22.016 --> 06:24.067
and have been
locked inside.

06:24.102 --> 06:26.083
I'm gonna hang this
off this.

06:26.118 --> 06:28.752
- We'll use a trigger-object proximity
sensor on the door.

06:28.787 --> 06:30.688
It's a device that lights up
and makes sound

06:30.689 --> 06:33.525
if something touches
what it's attached to.

06:35.027 --> 06:36.962
I'm gonna start
this recorder.

06:36.963 --> 06:39.163
See this
little red light?

06:39.198 --> 06:41.665
This is the device
that hears your voice.

06:41.700 --> 06:45.104
So the closer that you speak
to this little red light,

06:45.139 --> 06:47.023
the louder we can hear you.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.907
My name is Adam.
This is Amy.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.007
Hi.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.376
Kate and her husband
asked us to come in here

06:51.411 --> 06:53.143
and find out
what's been happening,

06:53.178 --> 06:55.214
because things are
going on in this house

06:55.249 --> 06:56.847
that they can't explain.

06:56.882 --> 07:00.235
Doors are being locked,
and they don't know why.

07:00.270 --> 07:04.081
Everything we've brought here
is just to talk to you

07:04.116 --> 07:07.893
and learn who you are
and learn why you're here.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.936
Someone trying to get...

07:17.069 --> 07:20.439
Is there somebody
wanting to open that door?

07:20.474 --> 07:22.008
Can you open that door?

07:23.409 --> 07:24.842
Go ahead. Touch it.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.678
If you touch the handle,
that...

07:26.713 --> 07:28.414
It would go off.

07:31.150 --> 07:34.352
Maybe they don't want us
to know they're there.

07:34.353 --> 07:37.189
Do you want me
to remove the alarm?

07:37.224 --> 07:39.025
This bed just shook.

07:42.694 --> 07:45.696
Are you shaking the bed?

07:45.731 --> 07:48.000
We've been investigating
for less than 30 minutes,

07:48.035 --> 07:50.002
and we're already
getting strange activity.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.171
There's a lady
named Lydia.

07:52.206 --> 07:54.306
Lydia,
are you here with us?

07:56.442 --> 07:57.943
If that's you, can you
touch that again

07:57.978 --> 08:00.145
and make that alarm
go off?

08:02.448 --> 08:03.382
Let's listen to this.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:12.625 --> 08:14.292
What was that?

08:14.327 --> 08:15.995
That's when
the bed shook.

08:19.531 --> 08:21.701
"I don't want to."
Listen to that.

08:24.703 --> 08:25.837
"I don't want to."

08:25.838 --> 08:27.004
- And that's female.
- Yeah.

08:27.039 --> 08:28.340
It does sound
like a female.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.825
"I don't want to."

08:29.860 --> 08:31.275
We heard you talk.

08:31.276 --> 08:33.111
You have to help us
answer some questions now

08:33.145 --> 08:35.798
because we know
that you're here.

08:35.832 --> 08:38.450
Could you please
tell us your name?

08:38.485 --> 08:41.118
Are you here alone?

08:41.153 --> 08:43.523
Are you part
of the Crocker family?

08:45.891 --> 08:48.127
See if she told us
her name.

08:53.067 --> 08:54.300
Right there.

08:57.803 --> 08:58.769
"Woman."

09:00.073 --> 09:01.005
It's the same voice.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.608
It is the same voice.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.709
It's a woman.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.844
- I think, since we got a female,
let's go to Lydia's. - Okay.

09:06.879 --> 09:07.844
- Let's just go.
- You know?

09:07.879 --> 09:09.549
Yeah. Let's do it.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.950
This is Lydia's room.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.788
All right, let's do some more
EVP work in here.

09:15.823 --> 09:19.358
Do you know
any of the Crocker family?

09:19.393 --> 09:22.026
Are you looking
for someone?

09:22.027 --> 09:23.629
We hear so much
about Aunt Lydia.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.231
Are you Lydia?

09:27.366 --> 09:28.935
I'm gonna listen.

09:32.604 --> 09:33.806
Is he saying "Willy"?

09:35.574 --> 09:38.276
Two syllables -- dah, dah.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.478
- We're gonna keep at it
with this little thing... - Yeah.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.413
...with the red light.

09:42.448 --> 09:45.483
We heard a name earlier.
It almost sounded like "Willy."

09:45.484 --> 09:46.784
It was hard to make out,

09:46.819 --> 09:49.271
so could you say it
a little louder?

09:49.306 --> 09:51.688
Can you just say
the name or names

09:51.723 --> 09:55.161
of the Crockers around here
or in this house?

09:56.562 --> 09:57.830
I'm gonna listen.

10:02.334 --> 10:04.069
It said it again.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.056
What is that, you guys?

10:08.091 --> 10:09.306
It came from over here.

10:09.341 --> 10:11.477
It sounded
like footsteps.

10:13.145 --> 10:15.314
Yo, there <i> is</i> somebody
sitting in the chair.

10:16.581 --> 10:18.784
Can you wave at us?

10:18.819 --> 10:19.884
****

10:19.919 --> 10:20.987
Yes, it's waving.

10:33.031 --> 10:34.899
Is it saying "Willy"?

10:34.934 --> 10:37.569
Adam and I are investigating
the Crocker house,

10:37.604 --> 10:39.970
one of the oldest homes
in New England.

10:40.005 --> 10:43.476
Something here is terrorizing
the newest living residents.

10:43.511 --> 10:45.075
We're in Aunt Lydia's room,

10:45.110 --> 10:48.612
named after a former owner
who died in the house.

10:48.647 --> 10:52.150
After we got our first audio
recording of a name -- Willy --

10:52.185 --> 10:55.388
we immediately heard a noise
come from the hallway.

10:57.122 --> 10:58.723
What is that, you guys?

10:58.724 --> 11:00.759
It came from over here.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.795
Sounded like footsteps.

11:04.432 --> 11:05.965
I heard that.

11:07.799 --> 11:09.301
Well, that's
what they hear.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.838
- They hear that all the time.
- Yeah.

11:14.272 --> 11:15.472
So, this thing
was rattling.

11:15.507 --> 11:18.241
Yeah, but that's not
what we heard.

11:18.276 --> 11:20.646
Something right here,
like, on the carpet.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.247
Sounded like this.

11:23.248 --> 11:25.816
What happened to you?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.953
You got us over here.
Is this something --

11:27.988 --> 11:31.257
Is there significance
to this area?

11:31.292 --> 11:33.659
Are you someone
who needs our help?

11:33.694 --> 11:36.027
We know that Kate
was in here one time

11:36.028 --> 11:39.129
and saw a shadow figure.

11:39.164 --> 11:41.399
We can hear you
moving around,

11:41.434 --> 11:45.971
and we're chasing you,
trying to talk to you.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.304
Strange.

11:47.339 --> 11:50.674
- For us to sit and ask
a million questions... - Yeah.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.643
It's almost like it was
just walking away from us,

11:52.644 --> 11:54.346
like it had enough.

11:56.481 --> 11:58.081
In only our
first night here,

11:58.116 --> 12:01.503
we've had something make
contact with a bedroom door,

12:01.538 --> 12:04.855
heard disembodied footsteps,
and felt a bed shake.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.460
Is all this activity coming
from the former occupant, Lydia,

12:08.495 --> 12:11.814
or is it someone else,
maybe another Crocker?

12:11.849 --> 12:15.133
The only new clue we have
is the name Willy.

12:18.737 --> 12:20.839
Today, we're going to
the Sturgis Library

12:20.840 --> 12:23.091
that has an entire
archive dedicated

12:23.126 --> 12:25.343
to the Crocker family
in the area.

12:25.344 --> 12:28.547
We're hoping to look for any
information on a Willy Crocker

12:28.582 --> 12:30.847
or any stories
related to the house.

12:30.882 --> 12:34.585
The Crocker family goes back
to the 1600s in this area,

12:34.586 --> 12:36.738
so there's a lot to cover.

12:36.773 --> 12:38.856
This has all
the properties,

12:38.891 --> 12:43.428
the notable, like, historic
sites of the Crockers.

12:43.463 --> 12:46.198
They have every Crocker
ever listed ever.

12:47.499 --> 12:49.166
So, listen to this.

12:49.201 --> 12:53.771
"In 1926, two women
were killed outright.

12:53.806 --> 12:56.808
Another died on the way
to Cape Cod Hospital, Hyannis.

12:56.843 --> 12:59.828
The automobile in which
they were riding collided

12:59.863 --> 13:02.814
with a Hyannis-bound train
at 5:00 this evening.

13:02.815 --> 13:07.119
The dead are Ms. Bertha Knight,
Ms. Manuel Gonzales,

13:07.154 --> 13:09.555
and Ms. Wilhelmina Crocker."

13:10.923 --> 13:12.256
Wait.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.193
Okay, do you think
this Wilhelmina is the Willy

13:15.228 --> 13:17.127
we got last night
on the recorder?

13:17.162 --> 13:20.598
<i>...or names of any
that are here?</i>

13:20.633 --> 13:22.999
Is it saying "Willy"?

13:23.034 --> 13:25.670
I mean, it's possible
Willy could be Wilhelmina,

13:25.671 --> 13:27.873
but then we're dealing
with a spirit from 1920,

13:27.908 --> 13:29.406
and not 1700s.

13:29.441 --> 13:30.842
I mean, I don't know why
she's not listed in

13:30.877 --> 13:32.311
any of these things.

13:32.346 --> 13:33.710
You're a Crocker.

13:33.745 --> 13:36.346
Yeah, there's a whole...

13:36.381 --> 13:38.550
set of Crockers that don't
seem to be listed,

13:38.585 --> 13:41.819
which makes me wonder why.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.889
Wilhelmina Crocker
and the train accident

13:43.924 --> 13:45.956
is a theory
we'll need to pursue.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.258
She was a Crocker,
and she died tragically

13:48.293 --> 13:51.246
just a few miles from
the house we're investigating.

13:51.281 --> 13:54.199
So it's possible she's behind
the aggressive activity

13:54.234 --> 13:56.168
directed at Kate
and her family.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.873
Tonight, we're gonna
start in Kate's bedroom,

14:00.908 --> 14:03.142
where she had
the terrifying experience

14:03.177 --> 14:05.377
of an entity charging
at her and her baby.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.078
Let's start
with the Spirit Box.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.645
Amy's gonna ask questions,

14:08.680 --> 14:12.517
and you can answer
if you talk through this.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.803
Just talk through
this thing, okay?

14:14.838 --> 14:17.088
The Spirit Box scans
radio frequencies

14:17.123 --> 14:19.156
that entities use
to communicate.

14:19.157 --> 14:21.758
I wear a blindfold
and noise-canceling headphones

14:21.793 --> 14:24.697
to block out any distractions,
so the only thing I hear

14:24.732 --> 14:27.199
are the messages
coming through the Spirit Box.

14:29.567 --> 14:31.770
So, can you tell me
your name?

14:35.941 --> 14:37.826
Something happen to a car?

14:37.861 --> 14:39.712
Was there a car accident?

14:41.647 --> 14:43.015
"Hurry."

14:44.082 --> 14:46.151
Hurry and do what?

14:46.186 --> 14:48.220
"Where are you going?"

14:50.789 --> 14:53.158
Are you part of a family
that lives here?

14:55.160 --> 14:57.361
"Other one."

14:57.396 --> 14:59.930
Are you part
of another family?

14:59.931 --> 15:01.933
Another part
of the Crockers?

15:05.704 --> 15:06.837
Could it be
something else?

15:06.872 --> 15:08.806
Anything else
you want to tell me?

15:13.812 --> 15:16.348
When I was asking
"Was there a car accident?"

15:16.383 --> 15:18.215
and you said,
"Where are you going?"...

15:18.250 --> 15:20.984
...like "Where are you going with this?"
kind of... - Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

15:21.019 --> 15:23.255
...and I said, "Well, were you
part of the Crocker family?"

15:23.290 --> 15:24.957
and you said,
"The other one."

15:27.092 --> 15:31.494
Let's do EVP work in here
and see if we get any EVPs.

15:31.529 --> 15:34.933
While Amy runs the recorder,
I'm going to use the SLS camera.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.068
It's a device engineered
to see figures

15:37.103 --> 15:38.668
not visible
to the naked eye.

15:38.703 --> 15:41.573
Are we talking about
the right people?

15:41.608 --> 15:44.310
The train accident...

15:44.345 --> 15:47.012
do you remember that?

15:47.047 --> 15:49.680
Did you know Wilhelmina?

15:49.681 --> 15:51.114
Did she go
by Wilhelmina,

15:51.149 --> 15:53.085
or did she go by
a different name?

15:55.353 --> 15:56.854
Let's listen to this.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.932
Hold on a second.
This thing is, like...

16:08.967 --> 16:11.069
Yo, there <i> is</i> somebody
sitting in the chair.

16:15.406 --> 16:19.344
Hey, if you're in that chair,
can you wave at us?

16:20.645 --> 16:21.812
****

16:21.847 --> 16:23.882
Yes, it's waving.

16:24.883 --> 16:26.482
Holy ****

16:26.517 --> 16:28.853
That light just came on
by itself.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.471
It's Night 2
of our investigation.

16:48.506 --> 16:51.559
We're in Kate's bedroom,
where an aggressive spirit

16:51.594 --> 16:54.613
charged at her and her baby,
but we're not alone.

16:54.648 --> 16:56.146
Hold on a second.
This thing is, like...

16:56.181 --> 17:00.619
Our SLS camera just picked up
an entity across the room.

17:00.654 --> 17:02.821
Yo, there <i> is</i> somebody
sitting in the chair.

17:04.122 --> 17:07.893
Hey, if you're in that chair,
can you wave at us?

17:09.260 --> 17:10.459
****

17:10.493 --> 17:11.863
Yes, it's waving.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.696
Yeah.

17:13.732 --> 17:18.368
So, whoever's in the chair,
we see you sitting there.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.242
Why don't you stand up
and walk over to us.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.743
It's okay.
You're welcome to join us.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.246
But we can see you.

17:29.247 --> 17:31.850
You, right there,
I'm pointing to you.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.985
Can you stand up, please?

17:34.986 --> 17:36.889
Are you
trying to stand up?

17:38.223 --> 17:39.190
It's gone.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.123
It's gone.

17:40.158 --> 17:41.525
That's so bizarre.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.126
It was so
strange-looking.

17:43.161 --> 17:44.262
I mean, it was sitting
in the chair.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.996
It was sitting
in the chair.

17:46.031 --> 17:48.500
And then, once we started
talking to it,

17:48.535 --> 17:50.653
it started
moving all weird.

17:50.688 --> 17:52.736
- It was sitting totally still.
- Yeah.

17:52.771 --> 17:54.504
Almost like
it was trying to --

17:54.539 --> 17:58.808
...either leave or get up
or not be visible.

17:58.843 --> 18:02.948
We have activity, so we
definitely have something here.

18:02.983 --> 18:06.852
I don't think they're
entirely sure of us yet,

18:06.887 --> 18:09.520
but we've gotten hits
on a few things. - Yeah.

18:09.555 --> 18:11.988
So, I don't know if
that necessarily means

18:12.023 --> 18:14.759
that anyone involved
in the train accident is here.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.994
- Hopefully, we can
get something... - Yeah.

18:17.029 --> 18:20.599
...that will give answers
to Kate.

18:20.634 --> 18:22.533
Absolutely.

18:24.202 --> 18:25.937
But at least something's
talking to us.

18:25.972 --> 18:28.005
And showing themselves.

18:31.376 --> 18:32.543
We have no doubt

18:32.578 --> 18:35.280
that there are spirits
present in Kate's house,

18:35.315 --> 18:36.847
but who are they?

18:36.882 --> 18:39.217
The "Willy" EVP
we captured is good,

18:39.252 --> 18:40.283
but it's not enough

18:40.318 --> 18:42.821
to say we're talking
to Wilhelmina Crocker,

18:42.856 --> 18:45.324
the woman killed
in a nearby train accident.

18:46.724 --> 18:48.693
To find out more
about Wilhelmina,

18:48.728 --> 18:50.627
we've contacted
David Crocker,

18:50.662 --> 18:53.965
a Crocker-family historian
and direct descendent

18:54.000 --> 18:56.266
of the original owner
of Kate's home.

18:56.267 --> 18:59.170
Maybe he can explain why
we couldn't find any connection

18:59.205 --> 19:02.507
between Wilhelmina
and the Crocker house.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.027
Hi. You must be David.
I'm Amy. This is Adam.

19:05.062 --> 19:07.477
- Sir, how are you? Adam.
Nice to meet you. - Good.

19:07.512 --> 19:09.547
Hi. So good to meet you.
Thank you for coming out.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.632
No problem.

19:10.667 --> 19:11.648
Come on in.

19:11.683 --> 19:13.268
If you want to have
a seat over here...

19:13.303 --> 19:14.853
Have a seat over there
on that couch.

19:14.888 --> 19:16.920
So, where to begin?

19:16.955 --> 19:19.924
What kind of condition
was this house in before?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.743
It was a museum,
so the town tried

19:21.778 --> 19:23.528
to keep it
as original as they could.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.297
There was no
updating at all.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.363
Yeah.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.065
So, there are some
particular Crockers

19:28.066 --> 19:30.018
that have come up
in our research.

19:30.053 --> 19:31.979
Were you familiar
with someone

19:32.014 --> 19:33.905
named
Clarence Shirley Crocker?

19:33.940 --> 19:35.872
- No, don't think so.
- He was local.

19:35.907 --> 19:38.109
So we were just trying to see
if there was a connection

19:38.144 --> 19:40.545
between those Crockers
and the Crockers here.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.913
- We're just trying to piece it
all together. - Yeah.

19:42.948 --> 19:44.115
I don't know if
you've heard of this.

19:44.150 --> 19:45.949
It was, like, in 1926.

19:45.984 --> 19:49.287
His wife, Wilhelmina --
There was a big train accident.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.323
Wilhelmina Jones?

19:53.224 --> 19:55.759
- From next door?
- From next door?

19:55.794 --> 19:57.829
There was a Jones
next door.

19:57.864 --> 19:58.996
Really?

19:58.997 --> 20:01.333
So, Wilhelmina Jones
married a Crocker?

20:01.368 --> 20:02.367
Yeah.

20:03.768 --> 20:05.870
There were more Joneses
in the village

20:05.905 --> 20:07.171
than there were Crockers.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.506
- We were connected with them.
We married into them. -!

20:09.541 --> 20:11.676
Okay? There was
a million Joneses.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.812
So Wilhelmina lived
right next door.

20:13.847 --> 20:15.745
Right next door.
Yeah.

20:15.780 --> 20:18.016
And were they in that house
for a long time?

20:18.051 --> 20:19.017
Yeah. Yeah.

20:19.052 --> 20:19.982
How long?

20:20.017 --> 20:22.154
Until 18 years ago.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.521
Okay.

20:25.556 --> 20:27.559
You've been really, really
helpful. Thank you.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.893
Well, thank you so much
for coming

20:28.928 --> 20:30.560
and sharing your stories

20:30.595 --> 20:33.297
and helping us
piece history together.

20:33.332 --> 20:34.264
Appreciate your time.

20:34.299 --> 20:35.750
It was my pleasure,
believe me.

20:35.785 --> 20:37.202
Awesome.
Well, thank you so much.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.937
We appreciate your help.

20:40.138 --> 20:42.489
Dave told us a bombshell
of information.

20:42.524 --> 20:44.841
Dave says the Joneses
lived next door.

20:44.842 --> 20:47.945
Absolutely.
I mean, that's incredible.

20:47.980 --> 20:51.049
At this point,
we have...a Crocker here.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.582
We have a Jones next door.

20:52.617 --> 20:54.252
The one house that
has stayed the same

20:54.287 --> 20:55.887
in this neighborhood
all this time...

20:55.922 --> 20:57.321
- ...is this house.
- Exactly.

20:57.356 --> 20:59.073
This house
has not changed.

20:59.108 --> 21:00.684
It looks
exactly like it did

21:00.719 --> 21:02.225
when she would
have been alive.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.796
People keep reporting
a woman running in here,

21:04.831 --> 21:06.295
saying,
"Help me! Help me!"

21:06.330 --> 21:08.765
She's going into the one place...

21:08.800 --> 21:11.101
...that is familiar
to her.

21:11.102 --> 21:12.587
It makes sense
that Wilhelmina

21:12.622 --> 21:14.180
could be haunting
this house,

21:14.215 --> 21:15.739
considering she lived
next door

21:15.740 --> 21:18.009
and married
into the Crocker family,

21:18.044 --> 21:19.745
but we need
definitive proof

21:19.780 --> 21:21.680
that it's her
we're talking to.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.581
Kate said the activity
intensified

21:23.582 --> 21:26.751
when they moved those historical
objects during renovation,

21:26.786 --> 21:29.220
so we're going to use
those same objects

21:29.255 --> 21:30.920
in tonight's investigation

21:30.955 --> 21:33.723
to see if we can get
a reaction from Wilhelmina.

21:33.758 --> 21:36.461
Let's bring the mirror
'cause that seems sentimental.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.361
- I'm bringing the shoe.
- Bring the shoe.

21:38.396 --> 21:40.232
This was a shoe that
was found in the wall

21:40.267 --> 21:41.565
upstairs in the attic.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.536
Guessing this was
somebody's mirror.

21:44.571 --> 21:47.472
All right, I'm gonna start
with the shoe

21:47.507 --> 21:49.239
because it's
the oldest item here

21:49.274 --> 21:53.244
and usually they put these
in walls for good luck.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.279
Okay.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.948
If there's
someone here with us

21:57.949 --> 22:00.417
who's upset
that these shoes

22:00.452 --> 22:02.987
and items were taken
out of the walls --

22:03.022 --> 22:04.120
but you have to
let us know.

22:04.155 --> 22:07.325
So just touch this like this
to let us know.

22:10.394 --> 22:13.531
If there's anything on this
table that belongs to you,

22:13.566 --> 22:16.301
can you tell us
what it is?

22:16.336 --> 22:19.669
Whose mirror was this?

22:19.704 --> 22:22.139
Is there anything
in the house that belonged

22:22.140 --> 22:28.045
to Wilhelmina...
or her husband, Shirley?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.881
What happened
to Wilhelmina?

22:33.351 --> 22:34.953
Didn't record a lot.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.097
Well, it's not attached
to the objects.

22:47.132 --> 22:50.368
So, here's the thing --
we don't have a clear direction

22:50.403 --> 22:53.571
as to why
Wilhelmina would be here.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.372
What is the connection?

22:55.373 --> 22:57.575
Adam and I believe
that Wilhelmina Crocker

22:57.610 --> 22:58.842
is in this house,

22:58.877 --> 23:02.379
but we need solid evidence,
and we want to know why.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.547
More importantly,
we need to know

23:04.582 --> 23:08.586
that this home is safe
for Kate and her family.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.689
This feels really creepy
right now.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.558
<i>...what happened here...</i>

23:12.593 --> 23:14.427
****

23:14.462 --> 23:15.527
God!

23:24.135 --> 23:27.104
We don't have a clear
direction as to why

23:27.139 --> 23:29.057
Wilhelmina would be here.

23:29.092 --> 23:30.941
What is the connection?

23:30.976 --> 23:33.445
There's a female spirit here
at the Crocker house.

23:33.480 --> 23:36.415
We believe it could be
Wilhelmina Crocker,

23:36.450 --> 23:39.350
a woman killed
in a 1926 train accident.

23:39.385 --> 23:41.351
But we need confirmation.

23:41.386 --> 23:43.721
So, I was thinking
a lot about it.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.022
Since we got nothing
from the objects,

23:46.057 --> 23:48.159
maybe we need to try
something more drastic.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.361
So, I'm wondering,
if we split up

23:51.396 --> 23:53.330
and I go to the scene
of the accident,

23:53.365 --> 23:56.535
maybe we could, like,
almost trigger the activity.

23:56.570 --> 23:59.471
I'll park safely away
from the train tracks

23:59.506 --> 24:01.890
and do some EVP work,

24:01.925 --> 24:04.274
talk about what happened.

24:04.275 --> 24:05.341
You know what?

24:05.376 --> 24:07.145
Text me when you do
your EVP session.

24:08.146 --> 24:09.312
That way, I know
you're doing it,

24:09.347 --> 24:11.316
and then that's when
I'll do Spirit Box...

24:11.351 --> 24:12.281
Okay.

24:12.316 --> 24:14.552
...and see if we can
get anything

24:14.587 --> 24:16.753
that correlates
and matches up.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.590
And if nothing happens,
then we'll broaden our search.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.190
Okay.

24:20.225 --> 24:22.660
And what we'll do is, we'll
start our timer on our phone

24:22.661 --> 24:24.913
at the exact same time,
or a stopwatch,

24:24.948 --> 24:27.130
and write down
if anything happens.

24:27.165 --> 24:28.965
If you hear anything,
if you see anything,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.903
write down exactly at what
point on the stopwatch...

24:31.938 --> 24:33.136
...that it happens.
- Okay.

24:33.171 --> 24:35.439
Do you think by triggering
something like this,

24:35.474 --> 24:36.575
it's gonna...

24:38.009 --> 24:40.578
...bring something
into this house?

24:40.613 --> 24:43.846
Not if it
wasn't already here.

24:43.881 --> 24:45.616
All right, let's split up
and see what happens here.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.352
I'm curious. I've never
done anything like this.

24:47.387 --> 24:49.251
So may as well try it.

24:49.286 --> 24:51.887
All right, do you want to --
Let's start our stopwatches now.

24:51.888 --> 24:53.425
- Okay, ready?
- Do the countdown.

24:53.460 --> 24:56.228
3, 2, 1, go.

24:58.930 --> 25:00.582
I hope this works.

25:02.269 --> 25:03.300
Okay.

25:03.335 --> 25:07.305
We're going to the scene
of the accident

25:07.340 --> 25:10.525
that involved
Wilhelmina Crocker.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.711
It makes sense sort of
in my brain.

25:13.746 --> 25:14.944
But at this point,

25:14.979 --> 25:16.981
we're kind of
running out of options,

25:17.016 --> 25:18.948
so we have to think
outside the box.

25:18.983 --> 25:21.017
I put a mini-DV camera
in this space

25:21.052 --> 25:25.054
so that I can capture anything
that I do in there.

25:25.089 --> 25:29.393
We want to find out if the
activity increases in this house

25:29.428 --> 25:34.966
based on what Amy is doing
at the train tracks.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.401
All right, we're almost there.

25:41.172 --> 25:42.674
Is that you guys?

25:45.209 --> 25:47.512
I just heard movement
to my right.

25:47.547 --> 25:48.879
Where are you?

25:51.383 --> 25:54.920
If there's anybody up here
that knows who Wilhelmina is...

25:57.088 --> 25:58.822
...I need you to do
something up here

25:58.823 --> 26:02.726
because I can't tell where
that sound is coming from.

26:02.761 --> 26:06.629
Amy, who was with me,
she's out by the train tracks.

26:06.630 --> 26:08.500
Is she safe out there?

26:10.401 --> 26:13.171
They don't have anyone there
signaling cars to stop

26:13.206 --> 26:16.141
when the train's coming,
so it's really scary.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.779
The tracks are right...there.

26:24.281 --> 26:26.415
I'm gonna move over here.

26:26.450 --> 26:29.003
I just want to keep changing
my location...

26:29.038 --> 26:31.556
...just because if they're not
gonna come --

26:32.808 --> 26:33.956
Holy ****

26:33.991 --> 26:35.910
Did you see that?

26:35.945 --> 26:37.829
This light bulb...

26:37.864 --> 26:39.729
Holy ****

26:39.764 --> 26:42.067
That light just came on
by itself.

26:43.868 --> 26:46.803
I feel so bad right now.

26:46.804 --> 26:49.523
Like, I just feel bad.

26:49.558 --> 26:52.208
Why did I think of this?

26:52.243 --> 26:55.013
So, I should say in --
I mean, this thing just, like --

26:55.048 --> 26:57.250
Like that!

26:59.884 --> 27:02.585
That's really weird.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.188
Is it, like, trying to turn --

27:04.189 --> 27:05.288
My God!

27:05.323 --> 27:07.458
Wait.
Is it trying to turn on?

27:12.197 --> 27:15.466
Okay, so we're getting
somewhere, right?

27:15.467 --> 27:17.919
Am I supposed to be in here?

27:17.954 --> 27:20.336
I mean, that light came on.

27:20.371 --> 27:22.974
Text Adam Berry --
"Starting EVP session now."

27:23.009 --> 27:25.577
Okay, so she's starting
the EVP session now.

27:25.612 --> 27:28.480
Let me grab the Spirit Box.

27:28.515 --> 27:31.314
So, right now, in real-time,

27:31.349 --> 27:34.149
Amy's gonna do an
EVP session and ask questions

27:34.184 --> 27:37.254
I can't hear and have
no knowledge of and record it,

27:37.289 --> 27:39.054
and I'm gonna listen
to the Spirit Box

27:39.089 --> 27:43.159
and see if the answers correlate
with what she's asking.

27:43.194 --> 27:47.630
If this works, it will be the
first time that I've ever seen,

27:47.631 --> 27:50.735
on any investigation ever,

27:50.770 --> 27:54.937
triggering a spirit

27:54.972 --> 27:58.843
based on being at a location
where they passed away.

28:03.481 --> 28:08.653
This feels really
freakin' creepy right now.

28:11.308 --> 28:14.101
Hello?

28:16.894 --> 28:19.461
I know there was a terrible
accident,

28:19.496 --> 28:23.301
and I feel like one of you
might be looking for help.

28:25.069 --> 28:29.239
My friend is waiting
at the Crocker Tavern right now.

28:29.274 --> 28:31.176
He's waiting for you.

28:31.211 --> 28:33.228
"Hi."

28:35.246 --> 28:36.948
"I'm outside."

28:38.583 --> 28:40.452
Why did you go there?

28:41.686 --> 28:44.789
Who was there
who could help you?

28:44.824 --> 28:46.088
"Help me."

28:46.123 --> 28:50.626
There's a scream at 22:29.

28:50.661 --> 28:53.064
Can you say something
if you're here?

28:56.434 --> 28:59.569
Just talk into this
little red light.

28:59.604 --> 29:01.572
Or go see my friend
at the Crocker Tavern.

29:01.607 --> 29:03.241
His name is Adam.

29:05.543 --> 29:07.611
That sounded like an explosion.

29:10.014 --> 29:12.900
I have that feeling like
something's definitely here.

29:12.935 --> 29:15.787
I don't know if it's just
the imprint of what happened

29:15.822 --> 29:18.373
here or what,
but I don't like it one bit.

29:18.408 --> 29:20.925
Let's listen to the first
one real quick.

29:27.531 --> 29:29.434
"Trigger."

29:29.469 --> 29:32.803
24:28.

29:34.138 --> 29:36.275
****

29:36.310 --> 29:38.878
God!

29:38.913 --> 29:41.411
"" 24:39.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.481
You guys, come on. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

29:43.516 --> 29:46.148
I'm done. ****

29:46.183 --> 29:48.419
You've got to be ****
kidding me. ****

29:48.454 --> 29:49.752
What?

29:49.787 --> 29:52.223
She just texted me,
"My God."

29:52.258 --> 29:53.892
What did we just start?

30:01.365 --> 30:03.234
"Trigger."

30:03.269 --> 30:06.936
24:28.

30:06.971 --> 30:10.274
I'm on the tracks
where Wilhelmina Crocker

30:10.309 --> 30:13.578
was killed in 1926,
trying to make contact with her.

30:14.545 --> 30:16.849
****

30:16.884 --> 30:19.518
God!

30:19.553 --> 30:22.118
"" 24:39.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.486
Wait a minute.

30:23.521 --> 30:26.057
Let's wait and see
if a train actually comes.

30:28.592 --> 30:30.762
Is a train really coming?

30:37.969 --> 30:39.568
You've got to be kidding me.

30:39.603 --> 30:42.005
You've got to be ****
kidding me. ****

30:42.040 --> 30:44.408
You've got to be kidding me
right now.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.343
I think that's our cue.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.112
You guys, come on. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

30:48.147 --> 30:49.178
I'm done.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.783
Time to go.

30:52.784 --> 30:54.952
"Thank God."

30:54.987 --> 30:57.121
I am shaking.

30:58.856 --> 31:01.726
So, the train alarm goes off
and no train comes.

31:01.761 --> 31:03.761
I <i> have</i> to tell Adam.

31:07.098 --> 31:08.397
What?

31:08.432 --> 31:11.268
She just texted me,
"My God."

31:14.139 --> 31:15.338
Hey. What's up?

31:15.373 --> 31:17.609
Okay, so, the most **** thing
that's ever happened

31:17.644 --> 31:19.776
in the history of my life
just happened.

31:19.777 --> 31:20.776
What?

31:20.811 --> 31:23.379
So, we were doing
an EVP session,

31:23.414 --> 31:30.219
and the train alarm went off
like a train was coming. - What?

31:30.254 --> 31:31.621
<i> For like 10-- </i>

31:31.622 --> 31:34.525
Yes, for like 10 seconds,
and then it stopped,

31:34.560 --> 31:36.460
and a train did not come.

31:36.495 --> 31:37.793
Are you kidding me?

31:37.828 --> 31:40.764
No, and now we're running,
and my voice is shaking.

31:40.765 --> 31:43.667
I'm that terrified right now,
and I'm ready to come back.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.770
I'm just gonna keep going
until you get here, okay?

31:45.805 --> 31:46.869
Okay.

31:46.904 --> 31:47.905
Okay. Bye.

31:47.940 --> 31:48.871
<i> Bye.</i>

31:50.609 --> 31:52.208
You guys...

31:52.243 --> 31:54.845
are you kidding me right now?

31:54.880 --> 31:57.115
What did we just start?

31:59.617 --> 32:01.586
What did we just start?

32:02.953 --> 32:05.055
If you're down here with us,
Amy's on her way back.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.022
I don't know. Whatever --

32:06.057 --> 32:10.762
Whatever happened,
whatever you did,

32:10.797 --> 32:13.196
you know, she's coming back.

32:13.231 --> 32:14.497
It's so creepy.

32:14.532 --> 32:17.168
I'm sorry, but sitting there
on that track was, like,

32:17.203 --> 32:19.988
one of the creepiest feelings
I've ever had.

32:20.023 --> 32:22.432
I shouldn't be scared.
This is my job. Whatever.

32:22.467 --> 32:24.841
But, like, there are certain
things that happen

32:24.842 --> 32:26.709
that really freak you out,

32:26.744 --> 32:29.545
and that was maybe
the most terrifying thing

32:29.580 --> 32:32.449
that's ever happened to me
as a paranormal investigator.

32:36.489 --> 32:37.920
Adam?

32:37.955 --> 32:40.591
Yeah?
I'm in the master bedroom.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.726
Not even kidding you.

32:44.461 --> 32:46.061
Worst experience
of my life.

32:46.096 --> 32:48.197
Okay, here.
Sit down for a second.

32:48.232 --> 32:50.451
The alarm to the train went off,
which makes no sense.

32:50.486 --> 32:52.670
Because I was thinking about it.
It has to be a switch.

32:52.705 --> 32:54.405
It's not gonna be
triggered by you.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.439
Show it to me.

32:56.440 --> 32:57.740
<i> ****</i>

32:57.775 --> 33:00.379
- We all think a train is coming.
- Like, nervous. Yeah.

33:00.414 --> 33:01.911
I point back.

33:01.946 --> 33:02.846
It's so messed up.

33:02.881 --> 33:03.746
That is crazy!

33:03.747 --> 33:07.017
So, I'm filming,
and then it just stops!

33:07.052 --> 33:09.186
It just stops!

33:10.654 --> 33:12.089
<i>I think that's our cue.</i>

33:12.124 --> 33:14.456
That is **** up, y'all.
Okay --

33:14.491 --> 33:17.728
Is that not the most
insane thing you've ever seen?

33:17.763 --> 33:19.194
What I find interesting

33:19.229 --> 33:21.932
is that you didn't
get any EVPs, right?

33:21.967 --> 33:22.899
No.

33:22.934 --> 33:25.636
Because she
literally was here.

33:28.239 --> 33:30.540
So, at first,
I am in Lydia's room.

33:30.575 --> 33:33.527
There was, like, little
movement, little knocking.

33:33.562 --> 33:36.480
And then I say, "Hey, do you
know where my friend is?"

33:36.515 --> 33:38.080
I was like,
"She went for a drive.

33:38.115 --> 33:39.683
I just hope she doesn't
go down to that road."

33:39.718 --> 33:41.251
Because there's nothing there
to warn you.

33:41.286 --> 33:42.453
And I was like,
"And it's dangerous."

33:42.488 --> 33:43.886
And then I start moving,

33:43.921 --> 33:48.826
and the light on the stand
comes the **** on.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.228
Light turns on.
Turns on.

33:50.263 --> 33:51.560
What?
You heard it click?

33:51.595 --> 33:53.431
It scared the hell out of us.
It scared the hell out of us.

33:53.466 --> 33:54.949
And that's when
I was sitting

33:54.984 --> 33:56.398
on the couch
in Lydia's room,

33:56.433 --> 33:58.602
getting things like,
"Hi. I'm outside."

33:58.637 --> 34:00.403
Scream.
There was a scream.

34:00.438 --> 34:02.540
There was something that
sounded like an explosion.

34:02.575 --> 34:04.339
"Help me."

34:04.374 --> 34:06.326
That's exactly
what they hear.

34:06.361 --> 34:08.244
I know!
That's what's so crazy!

34:08.279 --> 34:11.315
My mother has heard
somebody screaming "Help me"

34:11.350 --> 34:12.949
clear as day.

34:12.984 --> 34:14.585
Look how many
we got answered.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.717
Yeah, that's a lot.

34:16.753 --> 34:18.322
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.556
It really worked.

34:20.591 --> 34:22.676
This is truly
an amazing moment.

34:22.710 --> 34:24.786
In all my years
of investigating,

34:24.822 --> 34:26.693
I have never
done this before --

34:26.728 --> 34:28.530
triggering activity
in a home

34:28.565 --> 34:31.869
by contacting a spirit
at the spot where they died.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.972
We're convinced it was
Wilhelmina Crocker

34:34.007 --> 34:36.005
who caused the
train signal to go off

34:36.040 --> 34:39.310
and that she was speaking to
Adam through the Spirit Box.

34:39.344 --> 34:42.480
But we still want
to understand why she's here,

34:42.514 --> 34:44.914
so we need
to continue investigating.

34:44.949 --> 34:47.551
We're going to use
Wilhelmina's death certificate

34:47.585 --> 34:50.154
as a trigger object
and see if she talks to us.

34:50.188 --> 34:52.521
Okay. Here we go.

34:52.556 --> 34:55.542
All right, let's do
an EVP session.

34:55.577 --> 34:58.493
We're looking for
Wilhelmina Crocker.

34:58.528 --> 35:01.031
We just keep hearing stories
of a woman coming here

35:01.066 --> 35:04.535
asking for help,
and we think it might be you.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.735
We're here to help you.

35:06.770 --> 35:09.440
We have friends
who live in this house,

35:09.475 --> 35:12.441
and...they're
concerned, too.

35:12.476 --> 35:14.745
They want to make sure
you're okay.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.398
I went to
the train tracks,

35:17.433 --> 35:19.909
and it was
the train tracks

35:19.944 --> 35:22.386
where your accident
happened...

35:23.954 --> 35:25.756
...where you were killed.

35:27.158 --> 35:28.993
Did you see me there?

35:30.494 --> 35:33.029
Were you talking
to Adam, too?

35:34.231 --> 35:37.735
Are you walking around upstairs
when people hear footsteps?

35:39.169 --> 35:43.441
Can you tell us who
Clarence Shirley Crocker is?

35:45.142 --> 35:48.712
Do you know that you were
in an accident?

35:48.713 --> 35:54.618
It's been...almost 100 years
since you passed away.

35:57.288 --> 36:00.191
All right, we're gonna take
a listen to this, okay?

36:06.030 --> 36:07.265
"Yes."

36:14.605 --> 36:16.474
Did that say,
"My husband"?

36:18.009 --> 36:19.643
<i>...your death certificate.</i>

36:20.978 --> 36:23.212
It says,
"death certificate."

36:23.247 --> 36:24.182
I don't think she knows
she's dead.

36:32.956 --> 36:37.795
<i> Can you tell us who
Clarence Shirley Crocker is?</i>

36:37.830 --> 36:39.962
"My husband."

36:39.997 --> 36:42.832
We just made contact
with an intelligent spirit

36:42.833 --> 36:45.403
we believe
is Wilhelmina Crocker.

36:53.511 --> 36:55.177
"No."

36:55.212 --> 36:58.281
I don't think she knows
she's dead.

36:58.316 --> 37:01.417
This is extremely
delicate territory we're in.

37:01.418 --> 37:04.788
We really have to be careful
how we speak to Wilhelmina

37:04.823 --> 37:07.057
if she doesn't understand
she's dead.

37:07.092 --> 37:09.292
This frustration
could be the reason

37:09.293 --> 37:11.561
behind the
aggressive activity.

37:11.596 --> 37:13.830
Let's ask her.
Maybe that's why.

37:15.900 --> 37:19.169
Wilhelmina, I brought something
here for you to look at,

37:19.204 --> 37:21.337
and I'm sorry
to show it to you,

37:21.372 --> 37:25.308
but tell me, can you --
can you read this?

37:25.309 --> 37:27.175
Can you see this?

37:27.210 --> 37:28.510
I'm just bringing it here

37:28.545 --> 37:31.749
to show you that it's
your death certificate.

37:33.317 --> 37:37.253
Do you know that you were
in an accident?

37:37.288 --> 37:40.624
There was a tragic accident
that happened up the road.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.692
You unfortunately
didn't make it.

37:42.727 --> 37:45.261
We don't know where
you're supposed to go,

37:45.262 --> 37:47.463
but what we <i> can</i> do for you

37:47.498 --> 37:51.435
is help you in the
current state that you're in

37:51.470 --> 37:53.369
until you figure it out.

37:53.404 --> 37:56.407
Just tell us what you
want us to do.

37:59.109 --> 38:00.578
I'm gonna listen.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.785
It says,
"death certificate."

38:16.260 --> 38:18.026
"I'm going home."

38:18.061 --> 38:19.764
Says, "I'm going home."

38:23.433 --> 38:25.536
It says, "I'm going home."

38:29.039 --> 38:31.806
If you're leaving,
goodbye.

38:31.841 --> 38:35.546
Mrs. Crocker,
we know this is hard...

38:37.180 --> 38:40.984
...but we'll make sure
no one forgets you, okay?

38:40.985 --> 38:43.186
They should name
a bedroom after her.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.388
They should.
The Wilhelmina Room.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.858
I think at this point,

38:48.893 --> 38:50.894
we have a lot of news
for Joe and Kate.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.328
They're not in danger.

38:52.329 --> 38:54.065
Definitely not.

38:56.333 --> 38:58.335
We're meeting up with Kate
and her husband, Joe,

38:58.370 --> 38:59.868
to tell them
what we've learned.

38:59.903 --> 39:02.604
- Hey, guys. Welcome back to the house.
- Thank you.

39:02.639 --> 39:04.408
Welcome back
to your home.

39:04.443 --> 39:05.374
Have a seat.

39:05.409 --> 39:06.675
It's a tough one.

39:06.710 --> 39:09.146
It was a tough case,
but I think we figured it out.

39:09.181 --> 39:10.412
Yeah.

39:10.447 --> 39:14.884
So, one of the things that we do
is we search for tragedy,

39:14.919 --> 39:18.020
and we found, in 1926,

39:18.055 --> 39:21.658
there was a woman named
Wilhelmina Crocker.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.295
She was with
three other women.

39:24.330 --> 39:25.360
They were driving.

39:25.395 --> 39:28.081
They went over
a railroad crossing,

39:28.116 --> 39:30.733
and they just got T-boned by a train...
- My God.

39:30.768 --> 39:32.267
...a passenger train go--

39:32.302 --> 39:36.106
And one of them that passed
was Wilhelmina Crocker.

39:36.141 --> 39:39.910
And so we start just saying,
you know, "Wilhelmina.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.811
Is there a
Wilhelmina Crocker here?"

39:41.846 --> 39:44.815
And that was what
started getting a response.

39:44.850 --> 39:48.486
And so we'll play
some EVPs for you.

39:57.327 --> 39:58.394
You hear "Willy."

39:58.429 --> 39:59.427
Wow. "Willy." Yeah.

39:59.462 --> 40:01.129
And so, what we couldn't
figure out

40:01.164 --> 40:04.334
was the connection
between this accident site

40:04.369 --> 40:07.203
that's three miles away
and your house.

40:07.204 --> 40:10.023
We thought, "What if I go
to the accident site

40:10.058 --> 40:12.843
and investigate what would
happen at the house

40:12.878 --> 40:14.143
at the same time?"

40:14.178 --> 40:18.848
What happened is probably
the most insane experience

40:18.849 --> 40:21.868
I've had as an investigator.

40:21.903 --> 40:24.853
So we'll show you
the footage.

40:24.888 --> 40:26.773
<i> Is there something
that I can do for you?</i>

40:26.808 --> 40:28.658
<i> Can you tell me
what happened here...</i>

40:28.693 --> 40:31.830
****

40:31.865 --> 40:32.597
What?!

40:32.632 --> 40:33.294
Yeah.

40:33.329 --> 40:35.665
This is the winter in Cape Cod.
There are no trains.

40:36.852 --> 40:37.935
<i> Is a train really coming?</i>

40:40.873 --> 40:43.238
What?!

40:43.273 --> 40:45.141
So, at that point,
we ascertained,

40:45.176 --> 40:47.161
"Okay, Willy is here.

40:47.196 --> 40:49.111
Wilhelmina is here."

40:49.146 --> 40:51.714
So brings us to, like,
"So, well, what do we do?"

40:51.749 --> 40:54.283
We sat down last night,
and we had, like, this

40:54.284 --> 40:57.020
very intense
heart-to-heart with her,

40:57.055 --> 41:04.526
and we got really great
EVP responses. -

41:04.561 --> 41:07.662
"I'm going home."

41:07.697 --> 41:09.432
My God.
I have goose bumps.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.833
Look at that.

41:10.868 --> 41:14.270
We think Wilhelmina was causing
the extreme activity,

41:14.271 --> 41:16.940
like, locking doors and, like,
trying to get your attention.

41:17.941 --> 41:19.609
So we feel like
at this point,

41:19.610 --> 41:21.711
that kind of activity's
gonna stop.

41:21.746 --> 41:23.446
It's not gonna harm you.

41:25.115 --> 41:27.250
I sort of had the idea of,
like, naming one of the rooms

41:27.251 --> 41:28.483
after Wilhelmina.

41:28.518 --> 41:29.851
- That sounds like a great idea.
- That's a great idea.

41:29.886 --> 41:32.454
I mean, just to kind of
pay a little respect.

41:32.489 --> 41:35.592
I think you guys are doing a
wonderful job keeping the house,

41:35.627 --> 41:38.794
so feel free to live in it, enjoy it.

41:38.829 --> 41:40.697
So cool.
Thank you guys so much.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.133
You're welcome.

41:42.168 --> 41:43.499
Many, many thanks.

41:43.534 --> 41:44.933
When we started this case,

41:44.968 --> 41:47.837
we believed Aunt Lydia
could be causing the activity,

41:47.838 --> 41:50.641
but the more we listened,
the closer we came to the truth.

41:50.676 --> 41:52.509
Wilhelmina's sudden death
at the train tracks

41:52.544 --> 41:54.109
left her spirit confused

41:54.144 --> 41:57.413
and seeking help at the
one place that felt like home.

41:57.414 --> 41:59.281
Now that her story
has been told,

41:59.316 --> 42:03.419
she can finally move on
and, we hope, be at peace.
