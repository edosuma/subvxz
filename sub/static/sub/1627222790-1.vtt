WEBVTT

00:41.267 --> 00:42.767
Come on Aron.

00:44.736 --> 00:45.972
Come on.

00:48.807 --> 00:49.807
No pushing.

00:51.543 --> 00:53.980
Hey be careful.

00:54.013 --> 00:57.083
- Hurry up.
- Hang on, I'm on my way.

00:57.116 --> 00:58.817
Bonny look.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.053
Gerd, take a look.

01:01.087 --> 01:02.121
Wow!

01:03.822 --> 01:05.557
You're doing great Jonna.

01:05.590 --> 01:06.959
Oops.

01:06.993 --> 01:08.270
Steer a little
bit more that way.

01:08.294 --> 01:09.627
Good!

01:11.763 --> 01:14.100
Give me a hand Aron.

01:18.803 --> 01:20.805
Wow that's cool.

01:22.375 --> 01:24.276
Whoa, thanks Aron.

01:26.878 --> 01:27.980
Jonna, oh no.

01:30.782 --> 01:33.319
No.

01:34.954 --> 01:37.689
Well it's curtains
for that kite.

01:38.823 --> 01:41.227
Nah the kite is no big deal.

01:41.260 --> 01:42.660
Let's do something else.

01:43.963 --> 01:45.064
Wanna ride bikes?

01:49.868 --> 01:50.868
I don't know.

01:52.138 --> 01:52.938
But

01:52.972 --> 01:55.074
come on, please.

01:55.107 --> 01:57.243
You could at least
give it a try.

02:27.373 --> 02:28.373
No!

02:32.844 --> 02:34.146
Take it easy Aron!

02:35.147 --> 02:36.147
I'm sorry.

02:37.450 --> 02:38.583
How's it going?

02:39.285 --> 02:40.718
I'm never going to learn

02:40.752 --> 02:42.720
how to ride a bike
on this old thing.

02:43.755 --> 02:47.625
Arch your back, like
a cat and you won't get hurt.

02:47.659 --> 02:50.862
You only have one
body so treat it nice.

02:50.895 --> 02:52.864
But I can't do it.

02:52.897 --> 02:54.133
Try again.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.166
Watch out!

02:58.437 --> 02:59.804
You did it!

02:59.838 --> 03:00.805
Yay I did it!

03:00.839 --> 03:01.639
Nice!

03:01.673 --> 03:02.673
Like a cat.

03:04.243 --> 03:05.677
Good.

03:05.710 --> 03:06.711
Oh dear.

03:12.784 --> 03:16.821
Let's go, time to make
your beds and tidy up.

03:16.855 --> 03:21.093
Very thorough job today,
we're expecting visitors.

03:21.127 --> 03:23.229
All right now come on.

03:23.262 --> 03:25.164
Come on, come on this way.

03:26.265 --> 03:27.832
Jonna, Aron.

03:27.866 --> 03:28.867
Yes?

03:28.900 --> 03:30.100
Could you give me a hand here?

03:31.470 --> 03:34.739
Tord Fjordmark is coming
over for an inspection.

03:34.772 --> 03:36.008
Well this won't take long.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.710
Oh, all right.

03:38.743 --> 03:39.945
Just hurry up.

03:51.756 --> 03:53.159
Anything missing?

03:53.192 --> 03:54.994
Chili peppers and eggs.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.895
Just like last time.

03:56.929 --> 03:57.795
Weird.

03:57.829 --> 03:59.465
And nothing else?

03:59.498 --> 04:02.001
Our apples, carrots, potatoes

04:02.034 --> 04:03.402
they're all still there.

04:03.435 --> 04:05.237
Oh, there were some
corn, some shelf too.

04:05.271 --> 04:07.506
That's very strange.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.707
Makes you wonder
what keeps getting in.

04:09.741 --> 04:11.876
Could it be a fox or a badger.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.913
What if it gets into the house?

04:16.781 --> 04:18.050
Don't worry.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.717
Animals are afraid of people.

04:21.020 --> 04:22.720
There that should do it.

04:22.754 --> 04:23.956
Go on in you two.

04:23.989 --> 04:25.491
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:46.878 --> 04:48.113
Here.

04:51.016 --> 04:52.451
Are you ready?

04:52.484 --> 04:53.485
Here I come.

04:55.287 --> 04:56.788
Oh that's great.

05:00.858 --> 05:03.963
You wouldn't want to be
adopted but just any old family.

05:03.996 --> 05:06.332
That would kind of be
like a family of rats

05:06.365 --> 05:08.300
adopting a hamster.

05:08.334 --> 05:09.368
What?

05:09.401 --> 05:10.835
You're saying you're a hamster.

05:10.868 --> 05:12.404
You know what I mean.

05:12.438 --> 05:15.274
My family wouldn't be
all normal and boring.

05:15.307 --> 05:18.110
My dad will be an inventor
and my mom would be a captain

05:18.143 --> 05:20.512
of a ship sailing
the seven seas.

05:20.546 --> 05:22.047
But I've heard they bite.

05:22.081 --> 05:23.082
Moms?

05:23.115 --> 05:24.392
Why would they be biting anyone?

05:24.416 --> 05:27.253
No of course not, hamsters.

05:29.588 --> 05:31.789
My mother never went
around biting people.

05:31.823 --> 05:33.025
Did yours?

05:33.058 --> 05:34.593
I don't remember my mother.

05:34.627 --> 05:36.929
I've told you that already.

05:36.962 --> 05:37.829
Right.

05:37.862 --> 05:38.862
Sorry.

05:40.232 --> 05:41.567
You know what?

05:41.600 --> 05:43.868
Somebody will want
to adopt you someday.

05:43.901 --> 05:44.869
I know they will.

05:44.902 --> 05:46.105
I don't need a mother.

05:47.206 --> 05:48.840
I'm doing just fine on my own.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.876
And I've got you guys.

05:56.282 --> 05:57.950
Attention everybody.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.319
- Hello children.
- Hello Tord.

06:00.352 --> 06:01.153
Hi Tord.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.186
Well then.

06:04.089 --> 06:06.592
Mm hmm.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.195
Hmm.

06:12.598 --> 06:15.234
So what have you had to
eat today little girl?

06:15.267 --> 06:17.036
Porridge and a sandwich.

06:17.069 --> 06:18.570
Speech therapist.

06:18.604 --> 06:20.472
I've contacted them.

06:20.506 --> 06:21.873
Food gets an okay.

06:21.906 --> 06:22.941
Thank you.

06:22.975 --> 06:25.244
You are Jenny right?

06:25.277 --> 06:26.277
Jonna.

06:27.546 --> 06:28.981
Still here.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.050
How long has she been here?

06:31.083 --> 06:32.917
Her whole life.

06:32.951 --> 06:34.353
Eight years.

06:34.386 --> 06:37.656
But all the children
here are doing fine.

06:37.690 --> 06:39.625
I'd like to have a
word with you in private.

06:40.693 --> 06:41.927
Goodbye children.

06:41.960 --> 06:42.995
Goodbye Tord.

07:20.733 --> 07:22.568
One of your official
duties is to find

07:22.601 --> 07:24.937
homes for these poor
souls, isn't that so?

07:25.971 --> 07:26.971
Yes.

07:27.573 --> 07:28.573
Well...

07:29.575 --> 07:32.044
But sometimes it isn't easy.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.079
And then we have to...

07:34.113 --> 07:36.949
Doesn't seem to be
working, your approach.

07:39.451 --> 07:41.687
My approach?

07:41.720 --> 07:43.198
You let the kids
run around willy nilly

07:43.222 --> 07:45.023
and just hope that
someone will turn up

07:45.057 --> 07:46.458
and take one home with them.

07:53.999 --> 07:55.467
Know what?

07:55.501 --> 07:57.336
You gotta be more
on the ball Gerd.

07:57.369 --> 07:59.405
Take charge, show
some initiative.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.273
People hardly know
this place exists.

08:04.343 --> 08:06.712
Unless maybe you don't
want the children to leave.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.681
Of course I do.

08:10.716 --> 08:12.618
Ah!

08:12.651 --> 08:15.220
It's actually quite
beautiful here.

08:16.388 --> 08:17.388
Yes.

08:18.390 --> 08:20.426
The municipality can't
keep on pumping funds

08:20.459 --> 08:22.327
into an organization
that isn't working

08:22.361 --> 08:25.531
and this property could be
put to more constructive use.

08:25.564 --> 08:28.200
Something a greater number
of people could enjoy like

08:30.402 --> 08:31.603
a swimming pool.

08:32.571 --> 08:33.772
Cannonball.

08:33.806 --> 08:35.073
A pool?

08:35.107 --> 08:36.708
Here?

08:36.742 --> 08:38.510
But what about the orphanage?

08:38.544 --> 08:41.046
We'll tear it down and
invest in the future Gerd.

08:41.079 --> 08:42.281
Kids love pools.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.583
Yes, but this is their home.

08:46.018 --> 08:47.986
All right, listen this
is how it's going to be.

08:48.020 --> 08:50.088
You do what you're paid
for and unload a few kids.

08:50.122 --> 08:52.124
Either that or we
tear this place down

08:52.157 --> 08:54.326
and build a swimming center.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.361
You see, simple.

08:56.395 --> 09:00.098
Maybe even an aqua park.

09:00.132 --> 09:01.132
Yeah!

09:24.122 --> 09:25.224
Come and see us!

09:26.124 --> 09:28.527
- Here you go.
- Yeah thanks.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.028
Open house.

09:30.062 --> 09:31.430
Welcome.

09:31.463 --> 09:33.098
I'll see you there then.

09:33.799 --> 09:35.067
Okay?

09:35.100 --> 09:36.100
Okay!

09:36.869 --> 09:38.604
I'll see you at Sunnyside.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.140
Welcome.

09:42.174 --> 09:43.175
Oh thanks.

10:09.701 --> 10:10.869
Right.

10:10.903 --> 10:12.304
Well

10:12.337 --> 10:14.806
be sure to look
happy and healthy.

10:23.315 --> 10:25.651
Oh sweety.

10:27.319 --> 10:28.754
There there.

10:28.787 --> 10:29.787
So.

10:30.756 --> 10:34.560
Let's look on he
bright side shall we?

10:39.898 --> 10:41.099
Here they come.

11:10.262 --> 11:11.931
Help!

11:29.815 --> 11:31.550
Watch out!

11:31.583 --> 11:33.185
Run!

11:33.218 --> 11:34.218
Run Jonna!

11:46.865 --> 11:48.834
I can't live with a gorilla.

11:51.536 --> 11:52.972
Help!

11:53.006 --> 11:54.139
It's too scary.

11:56.241 --> 11:57.909
I bet she has that big belly

11:57.944 --> 11:59.211
because she eats children.

12:01.313 --> 12:03.215
Stop it Aron.

12:03.248 --> 12:04.783
Of course she doesn't eat kids.

12:05.952 --> 12:07.987
Like you know so
much about gorillas.

12:08.021 --> 12:10.389
Apparently more than you do.

13:00.973 --> 13:02.975
Are you sure about this?

13:04.309 --> 13:05.577
Somebody has to do it

13:05.610 --> 13:07.679
or else he'll close
Sunnyside down.

13:11.650 --> 13:12.650
Jonna

13:13.953 --> 13:16.254
it won't be forever.

13:16.288 --> 13:17.823
I'll come and get you

13:17.856 --> 13:20.592
as soon as this business
with Tord is taken care of.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.028
I promise.

13:30.869 --> 13:31.869
Right.

13:33.839 --> 13:34.839
There.

13:37.509 --> 13:40.012
Always remember to
wash your hands.

13:42.014 --> 13:43.482
And I'll see you soon.

14:28.894 --> 14:29.894
Welcome home.

14:34.533 --> 14:36.102
Yes I can talk.

14:38.703 --> 14:39.871
Call me Gorilla.

14:42.175 --> 14:43.175
Follow me.

15:03.129 --> 15:04.563
It might not seem like much,

15:04.596 --> 15:07.099
but it's my home and
now it's your home too.

15:24.616 --> 15:25.616
Here.

15:27.153 --> 15:30.522
Our home is our castle.

15:30.555 --> 15:35.560
A fortress we build, a world
of our very own making.

15:37.196 --> 15:39.497
Now isn't that just so true?

15:41.033 --> 15:45.037
What I mean is that everything's
going to be all right.

15:45.071 --> 15:46.605
I've got something to show you.

15:51.177 --> 15:52.177
Your room.

15:55.614 --> 15:56.882
Get some rest.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.218
We'll have something
to eat later on.

15:59.252 --> 16:00.252
My room?

16:44.562 --> 16:47.632
The biggest aqua park
in all of Northern Europe.

16:57.542 --> 17:00.212
The Fjordmark Pool,
named after me.

17:02.014 --> 17:03.249
And you too father.

17:06.518 --> 17:07.518
Come in.

17:13.259 --> 17:14.526
Hello.

17:14.559 --> 17:16.028
Oh, it's you?

17:16.062 --> 17:18.563
I hope you've been on the
ball about those kids.

17:18.596 --> 17:20.132
Oh absolutely.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.633
Well?

17:21.666 --> 17:24.536
I've put myself out
there the way I should.

17:24.569 --> 17:27.539
Arranged for ads and posters

17:27.572 --> 17:30.642
and there will be an
open house with balloons.

17:30.675 --> 17:31.310
And...

17:31.344 --> 17:32.344
Enter!

17:35.214 --> 17:38.250
So we can keep Sunnyside open.

17:39.684 --> 17:40.319
Oh no.

17:40.353 --> 17:41.353
No, no, no.

17:42.787 --> 17:44.632
You need to put in more
effort than that you know?

17:44.656 --> 17:46.092
Keep on keeping on.

17:46.891 --> 17:47.994
More?

17:48.027 --> 17:50.162
But I thought that-

17:50.196 --> 17:51.663
- You thought?

17:51.696 --> 17:53.865
A public servant never
thinks, they know Gerd.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.935
Well off you go I'm busy.

17:59.105 --> 18:00.638
Well?

18:00.672 --> 18:02.041
Well

18:02.074 --> 18:07.246
I've been looking at
the development plan.

18:07.279 --> 18:11.217
The lot Sunnyside's on

18:11.250 --> 18:15.154
will do nicely for an

18:15.187 --> 18:17.356
- aqua park.
- Of course it will.

18:17.390 --> 18:18.556
But

18:18.590 --> 18:22.995
I have a suggestion.

18:24.363 --> 18:28.533
Here's Sunnyside.

18:29.601 --> 18:31.569
What if you built

18:31.603 --> 18:35.774
your park over here

18:35.807 --> 18:37.209
instead?

18:38.044 --> 18:39.044
There?

18:39.811 --> 18:43.215
It has a great view

18:43.249 --> 18:48.254
and it's much
closer to town too.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.855
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

18:50.889 --> 18:52.191
That that isn't municipal land,

18:52.224 --> 18:53.392
that's where the junk yard is

18:53.426 --> 18:54.893
or the park or whatever it is.

18:54.927 --> 18:55.961
True.

18:55.995 --> 18:59.398
But maybe that can be arranged

18:59.432 --> 19:02.068
if the price is right.

19:02.101 --> 19:04.336
I see what you're driving at.

19:04.370 --> 19:08.174
The municipality could
buy the junk yard.

19:45.478 --> 19:46.911
Hello?

19:52.485 --> 19:55.955
♪ I could eat a
trazillion bananas ♪

19:55.988 --> 19:59.425
♪ No I could eat a horse ♪

20:00.792 --> 20:01.792
Peekaboo!

20:03.862 --> 20:04.862
I'm sorry.

20:05.431 --> 20:06.398
Help!

20:06.432 --> 20:07.433
Please don't eat me.

20:10.735 --> 20:11.735
Eat you?

20:13.738 --> 20:15.441
Is that what you thought?

20:15.474 --> 20:17.409
No no way.

20:19.011 --> 20:21.046
I made dinner for us.

20:23.149 --> 20:24.283
For us?

21:14.166 --> 21:15.166
Whoa!

21:17.136 --> 21:18.136
Goal!

21:19.471 --> 21:20.471
Nice!

21:22.308 --> 21:24.776
Gerd always said I
had a talent for soccer.

21:35.087 --> 21:36.088
Follow me.

23:07.912 --> 23:09.415
Thank you.

23:15.054 --> 23:17.423
Want to hear something?

23:17.456 --> 23:18.991
Like what?

23:19.024 --> 23:20.592
The story of us.

23:20.626 --> 23:21.627
Uh huh.

23:27.299 --> 23:28.534
Before I found you,

23:29.901 --> 23:32.604
I used to sit here
alone under the Ape Star

23:32.638 --> 23:34.839
just yearning for a child.

23:36.475 --> 23:39.911
I just knew you were out there,

23:39.945 --> 23:41.547
that I had to find you.

23:43.248 --> 23:44.248
You Jonna.

23:45.217 --> 23:46.217
You.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.655
And funnily enough,

23:49.688 --> 23:53.258
it turns out that you're
great at washing your hands.

23:53.292 --> 23:54.493
Just like me.

23:57.663 --> 23:58.931
The Ape Star,

24:01.200 --> 24:02.968
which one is that?

24:03.001 --> 24:04.937
You can't see it from here.

24:04.970 --> 24:06.972
I'll show it to you one day.

24:09.141 --> 24:11.543
But now it's time
to get some sleep.

24:12.411 --> 24:14.346
Tomorrow we'll have customers.

24:29.695 --> 24:30.695
That's cool.

24:31.630 --> 24:33.132
- Mum.
- Oh careful.

24:33.165 --> 24:34.700
Watch out don't break anything.

24:47.713 --> 24:48.713
That's pretty.

24:54.052 --> 24:55.487
He's interested.

24:55.521 --> 24:56.521
Can you tell?

25:01.160 --> 25:02.661
So, what can I do for you?

25:04.563 --> 25:06.732
I'm looking for
something for my daughter

25:06.765 --> 25:09.067
but it can't be too expensive.

25:10.002 --> 25:11.637
That's a pretty good phone.

25:11.670 --> 25:14.973
It was ringing off the hook
at town hall back in the day.

25:16.208 --> 25:17.142
Really?

25:17.176 --> 25:19.278
Well, there you go.

25:19.311 --> 25:20.345
Well, maybe.

25:22.748 --> 25:24.383
20 crowns?

25:26.452 --> 25:29.321
To think it was an
instrument of justice too.

25:30.489 --> 25:32.157
How about a discount?

25:33.192 --> 25:35.260
That'll be five crowns.

25:35.294 --> 25:36.795
What?

25:36.829 --> 25:38.764
It says 20 on the price tag.

25:38.797 --> 25:40.432
That's a mistake.

25:40.466 --> 25:43.368
It's easy to make mistakes
with paws like these.

25:43.402 --> 25:45.704
The number should be a five.

25:45.737 --> 25:47.706
Wow, thanks.

25:49.842 --> 25:51.710
Now that was really cheap.

25:52.811 --> 25:55.347
He was afraid that
he couldn't afford it.

25:58.417 --> 26:00.686
If a person doesn't
have much money,

26:00.719 --> 26:02.521
I generally cut the price.

26:02.554 --> 26:06.024
People who can afford
more can pay more.

26:06.058 --> 26:10.128
Nothing is to be
preferred before justice.

26:10.162 --> 26:12.831
Socrates said that, you know?

26:12.865 --> 26:15.334
Go on, see if you can
find some more buyers.

26:54.873 --> 26:56.508
I'm taking the bike.

26:56.542 --> 26:58.677
It's exactly the same
kind my granddaughter has.

26:58.710 --> 27:01.380
So it only makes sense
that we get a spare.

27:01.413 --> 27:02.413
Where do I pay?

27:05.117 --> 27:06.218
I'll show you.

27:18.297 --> 27:20.465
That one's not for sale.

27:20.499 --> 27:21.499
What?

27:22.768 --> 27:25.170
It's a nice ride,
but it's not for sale.

27:25.939 --> 27:27.306
How very odd.

27:27.339 --> 27:28.640
Is it about the money?

27:28.674 --> 27:30.442
What about if I offer you more?

27:31.877 --> 27:33.812
Wow that's a lot of money.

27:35.180 --> 27:37.282
Sorry that bike isn't for sale.

27:38.884 --> 27:39.884
But...

27:41.853 --> 27:43.855
Could you please excuse us?

27:43.889 --> 27:45.223
What do you say?

27:45.257 --> 27:46.491
Don't you want it?

27:50.930 --> 27:54.866
Once again, I'm sorry but
this bike isn't for sale.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.902
But the sign says
that you sell things.

27:56.936 --> 27:58.136
We do.

27:58.170 --> 28:00.472
Just not this particular bike.

28:00.505 --> 28:01.505
Disgraceful.

28:04.610 --> 28:05.610
Thank you.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.647
Don't you want to try it out?

28:10.182 --> 28:11.483
Maybe some other time.

28:12.851 --> 28:13.851
Okay.

28:23.295 --> 28:26.898
Watch out for that
gorilla, she's trouble.

28:49.254 --> 28:50.990
Gerd, Gerd, Gerd guess what?

28:51.024 --> 28:53.925
I saw her at the junk yard
and it doesn't look good.

28:59.264 --> 29:01.667
Well, you'll just
have to move won't you?

29:01.700 --> 29:04.202
Your permit for this junk yard
isn't good forever you know?

29:04.236 --> 29:05.504
And I'm the one who decides

29:05.537 --> 29:07.940
who does or does
not get a permit.

29:07.974 --> 29:08.974
But

29:10.043 --> 29:12.011
but I don't want to sell.

29:12.045 --> 29:14.981
Where am I supposed to
go if I can't live here?

29:15.014 --> 29:17.249
Well, that's
hardly my problem is it?

29:17.282 --> 29:18.383
Or the municipality's.

29:19.618 --> 29:20.652
That voice.

29:22.888 --> 29:23.855
Jane?

29:23.889 --> 29:24.890
Really?

29:24.923 --> 29:25.968
So this became your family.

29:25.992 --> 29:27.492
Leave her alone.

29:27.526 --> 29:30.495
Can't you see she's
in the lady's room.

29:30.529 --> 29:32.230
Go away, beat it!

29:33.632 --> 29:36.435
I'm going all right, but
you'll be seeing me soon enough.

29:36.468 --> 29:37.970
This is going to
be an aqua park.

29:42.874 --> 29:43.874
He's gone now.

30:04.596 --> 30:08.667
Tord Fjordmark wants to buy
the junkyard and the cottage.

30:08.700 --> 30:09.969
Our home.

30:10.002 --> 30:12.270
He wants to build
a giant aqua park

30:12.304 --> 30:15.041
but I have no
intention of selling.

30:15.074 --> 30:18.276
But isn't there already
a local public pool?

30:18.310 --> 30:23.015
Yes but he wants this one
to be an outdoor aqua park,

30:23.049 --> 30:24.416
Fjordmark Land.

30:25.851 --> 30:28.720
He picture himself a big shot,
a pillar of the community.

30:30.123 --> 30:32.091
But what if someone
builds an even bigger pool?

30:32.125 --> 30:34.426
Then no one will
remember him after all.

30:35.427 --> 30:37.029
Didn't think of that.

30:38.030 --> 30:39.999
That's clever!

30:40.032 --> 30:41.500
Maybe we should do that.

30:42.734 --> 30:44.036
If you want to be remembered,

30:44.070 --> 30:46.838
it's smarter to do nice things.

30:46.872 --> 30:48.507
Much smarter, Jonna!

30:59.051 --> 31:00.719
Charming isn't it?

31:00.752 --> 31:03.488
That dress is very yellow.

31:03.522 --> 31:04.422
I know.

31:04.456 --> 31:05.724
I just love the color.

31:11.429 --> 31:13.598
So how about this?

31:13.632 --> 31:16.068
I think you look
nicer without it.

31:18.370 --> 31:19.905
Get in the car and let's go.

31:19.939 --> 31:23.075
Okay.

31:41.493 --> 31:43.095
What on earth is she wearing?

31:44.863 --> 31:46.098
What a rust bucket.

31:55.674 --> 31:58.144
What a perfect place to park.

31:58.177 --> 32:00.545
What's wrong with everybody?

32:04.749 --> 32:06.085
Don't mind them, follow me.

32:22.935 --> 32:24.170
Wow.

32:24.203 --> 32:25.537
Be with you and a tick!

32:32.577 --> 32:35.513
I adore books.

32:35.547 --> 32:37.216
If I didn't have the junk yard,

32:37.250 --> 32:39.584
I'd have a second
hand bookstore.

32:40.752 --> 32:43.189
Well, what a pleasant surprise.

32:43.222 --> 32:47.226
Gustav this is.

32:47.260 --> 32:48.560
Jonna.

32:48.593 --> 32:49.962
- Hi Jonna.
- Hello.

32:49.996 --> 32:52.898
It's great to meet you at last.

32:52.932 --> 32:55.935
If you only knew how much
she's longed for you.

32:55.968 --> 32:59.171
She's been looking
for you for years.

33:02.074 --> 33:04.210
Has it arrived?

33:04.243 --> 33:05.243
Yes.

33:06.279 --> 33:08.014
And it's beautiful.

33:16.222 --> 33:17.756
May I have a look?

33:19.125 --> 33:21.826
- Oh wow.
- Isn't it just a work of art?

33:21.860 --> 33:23.695
Wow, wow.

33:29.201 --> 33:34.173
"Oliver Twist" first edition.

33:35.540 --> 33:37.209
Oh, I've been waiting
for it all my life.

33:37.243 --> 33:38.677
It's wonderful.

33:38.710 --> 33:41.513
But it's expensive.

33:41.546 --> 33:44.250
Right I understand.

33:44.283 --> 33:45.283
The lot?

33:49.554 --> 33:50.957
Wow.

33:50.990 --> 33:52.490
Unfortunately yes.

33:52.524 --> 33:53.525
Very expensive.

33:53.558 --> 33:56.095
And I really wanted to buy it.

33:57.629 --> 34:02.268
But, you know what, I'll
have to think about it.

34:03.768 --> 34:04.937
Is it an exciting book?

34:05.770 --> 34:06.905
Exciting?

34:06.939 --> 34:08.573
Oh very!

34:08.606 --> 34:10.809
It's about a boy who
grows up in an orphanage.

34:10.842 --> 34:13.145
He runs away and...

34:14.347 --> 34:17.549
I shouldn't serve
up any spoilers.

34:17.582 --> 34:20.953
But yes, it's
incredibly exciting.

34:20.987 --> 34:23.122
Sounds like a book for me.

34:23.155 --> 34:25.057
Since I've been in an orphanage.

34:28.294 --> 34:30.695
I can borrow it
from the library.

34:31.896 --> 34:34.100
Maybe we could get
a small discount?

34:38.570 --> 34:40.339
This kid.

34:40.373 --> 34:41.373
It's me.

34:42.341 --> 34:43.875
Taught her everything.

34:46.578 --> 34:48.981
I guess I'll have to
tighten my belt for a while.

34:50.615 --> 34:52.151
I'll give you 10% off.

34:53.585 --> 34:54.819
Okay!

34:54.853 --> 34:56.288
I'll take it.

34:57.323 --> 34:59.058
Yes!

34:59.091 --> 35:01.860
Thank you so very much.

35:01.893 --> 35:03.229
That's a deal.

35:15.341 --> 35:17.742
You know what little missy?

35:17.776 --> 35:20.379
We make an amazing team.

35:20.413 --> 35:23.748
Maybe we could get
a small discount?

35:23.782 --> 35:25.084
Right.

35:25.117 --> 35:26.785
Otherwise you wouldn't
have bought it.

35:31.223 --> 35:32.324
Thank you.

35:33.825 --> 35:37.096
That was the best
discount I ever got.

36:32.451 --> 36:34.652
What's going on, Jonna?

36:34.686 --> 36:36.721
Nothing, I just
dropped something.

36:39.858 --> 36:41.393
Are you riding your bike?

36:44.396 --> 36:48.000
Jonna?

36:48.033 --> 36:49.033
Jonna.

36:51.070 --> 36:52.670
What's the matter?

36:53.105 --> 36:54.440
Nothing.

36:59.011 --> 37:00.011
Jonna.

37:00.712 --> 37:02.314
Let me have a look.

37:04.984 --> 37:06.751
Sweetheart

37:07.186 --> 37:09.421
that must really hurt.

37:10.889 --> 37:13.192
Just looking at it
makes me hurt too.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.062
There there we've got this.

37:18.964 --> 37:20.832
I don't know how to ride a bike.

37:20.865 --> 37:22.767
I want to know how.

37:22.800 --> 37:26.005
Everybody but me
knows how to do it.

37:26.038 --> 37:28.307
And I bet I broke
the bike now too.

37:30.009 --> 37:34.013
What if you get fed up
and not want me anymore?

37:35.281 --> 37:37.349
There there little one.

37:38.250 --> 37:39.318
Sweety.

37:41.053 --> 37:42.053
Tell me.

37:43.455 --> 37:44.923
About us?

37:46.559 --> 37:47.559
Uh huh.

37:50.862 --> 37:52.364
Before I found you,

37:53.032 --> 37:56.202
I used to sit alone
under the Ape Star

37:56.235 --> 37:58.903
and yearn for a child.

37:58.938 --> 38:03.509
And I just knew that you
were out there somewhere

38:04.577 --> 38:07.079
and that I had to find you.

38:07.112 --> 38:08.948
You Jonna, you.

38:10.583 --> 38:13.918
And it turns out
that you're a champ

38:13.953 --> 38:16.522
at washing your hands too.

38:16.555 --> 38:17.922
Just like me.

38:25.064 --> 38:26.265
Don't let go.

38:26.966 --> 38:27.966
Never.

38:28.167 --> 38:30.035
I'll never let you go Jonna.

38:44.049 --> 38:46.784
You weren't supposed to let go.

39:18.584 --> 39:19.584
Wow.

39:31.130 --> 39:32.830
Peep peep peep.

39:32.864 --> 39:33.864
Peep peep.

39:35.134 --> 39:37.569
A scam that's what this is.

39:37.603 --> 39:40.072
You're lucky that
I don't report you.

39:40.105 --> 39:41.839
A scam!

39:41.873 --> 39:44.009
Well that's
going a bit too far isn't it?

39:46.078 --> 39:46.979
Too far?

39:47.012 --> 39:48.614
You must be joking!

39:48.647 --> 39:50.983
Two used cooking pots
for a hundred crowns.

39:51.016 --> 39:52.384
Forget it.

39:52.418 --> 39:53.552
Goodbye.

39:57.189 --> 39:58.424
Oh my.

40:00.159 --> 40:02.161
This isn't going well.

40:02.194 --> 40:03.495
No.

40:03.529 --> 40:06.831
Things work better if
we were both involved.

40:09.635 --> 40:11.136
We need to think of something.

40:12.705 --> 40:14.340
She's been here before

40:14.373 --> 40:17.609
and she certainly
doesn't need a discount.

40:17.643 --> 40:20.379
Filthy rich, but a real Scrooge.

40:20.412 --> 40:21.246
Scrooge?

40:21.280 --> 40:22.281
A cheapskate.

40:22.314 --> 40:23.915
He's a character in another book

40:23.949 --> 40:25.883
by the men who vote
"Oliver Twist".

40:25.917 --> 40:26.618
Excuse me.

40:26.652 --> 40:28.220
12 crowns?

40:28.253 --> 40:29.921
Seems a tad overpriced.

40:32.057 --> 40:33.225
Let me have a look.

40:37.096 --> 40:38.197
Are you with me Jonna?

40:38.230 --> 40:39.230
Yeah.

40:40.132 --> 40:44.269
Oh, I'm so sick of this.

40:44.303 --> 40:47.673
This is an antique.

40:47.706 --> 40:49.641
But that's not your fault.

40:49.675 --> 40:50.908
But you know what?

40:50.943 --> 40:52.411
It's yours for 400.

40:54.380 --> 40:55.647
400!

40:55.681 --> 40:56.482
That's far too...

40:56.515 --> 40:57.515
I don't know.

40:58.984 --> 40:59.984
Right I get it.

41:00.986 --> 41:02.920
I'm furious.

41:02.955 --> 41:05.657
You little missy will be
sleeping in the outhouse tonight.

41:05.691 --> 41:09.962
How many times have I told you
to get the prices straight?

41:09.995 --> 41:10.629
You know what?

41:10.662 --> 41:11.930
400 is fine.

41:11.964 --> 41:12.964
I'll take it.

41:14.767 --> 41:15.767
It worked.

41:20.472 --> 41:23.075
Jonna get your act together.

41:23.108 --> 41:24.009
I'm sorry.

41:24.042 --> 41:25.411
I can do this.

41:25.444 --> 41:26.678
I promise.

41:26.712 --> 41:28.647
No, no, no, no, that's too much.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.416
10 is enough.

41:30.449 --> 41:31.450
Here you go.

41:31.483 --> 41:33.118
Look at all these people.

41:34.586 --> 41:36.588
No, no, no that one's free.

41:48.300 --> 41:49.968
Tell me now.

41:50.002 --> 41:52.571
I have to hear all the details.

41:54.773 --> 41:55.773
Did she look okay?

41:57.209 --> 41:59.678
Well, she was
wearing a yellow dress.

41:59.711 --> 42:00.579
Jonna!

42:00.612 --> 42:01.713
How did Jonna look?

42:01.747 --> 42:03.515
Did she seem to be all right?

42:03.549 --> 42:06.618
That gorilla was
pulling her into a shop.

42:06.652 --> 42:08.120
What?

42:08.153 --> 42:09.188
Pulling?

42:09.221 --> 42:10.522
How?

42:10.556 --> 42:11.557
Hard?

42:11.590 --> 42:12.991
Just pulled her, like when

42:13.025 --> 42:15.093
you're urging
someone to hurry up.

42:15.127 --> 42:16.328
Oh dear.

42:17.496 --> 42:20.566
I really wonder
how Jonna is doing.

42:20.599 --> 42:24.069
Why on earth did I let
that gorilla take her away?

42:24.102 --> 42:25.102
Oh no.

42:28.240 --> 42:29.741
Let's celebrate.

42:31.076 --> 42:32.778
We make a great team.

42:34.646 --> 42:36.415
Ooh, elegant.

42:37.349 --> 42:38.349
Yeah?

42:39.151 --> 42:40.151
You can drive.

42:41.553 --> 42:42.754
Me?

42:42.788 --> 42:44.289
But I'm just a kid.

42:45.557 --> 42:47.059
Sure.

42:47.092 --> 42:49.027
But you'll have to
learn to drive anyway.

42:49.061 --> 42:50.662
So you might as well start now.

42:51.864 --> 42:53.065
All right.

42:55.567 --> 42:56.567
There you go.

42:59.071 --> 43:00.072
Sure.

43:02.241 --> 43:03.241
Like this?

43:04.309 --> 43:05.077
Perfect.

43:05.110 --> 43:06.110
Let's go.

43:09.081 --> 43:09.781
Whoops.

43:09.815 --> 43:11.283
Don't worry.

43:11.316 --> 43:13.585
Our table is reserved
for the entire evening.

43:13.619 --> 43:14.619
Start it up again.

43:18.090 --> 43:19.324
And making mistakes is fine.

43:20.492 --> 43:21.793
That's how you learn okay?

43:37.342 --> 43:39.478
I'm not selling this place.

43:40.546 --> 43:41.813
Well, we'll see about that.

43:43.749 --> 43:45.117
What!

43:45.150 --> 43:46.585
She lets the kid drive?

44:09.708 --> 44:10.708
Wow.

44:12.477 --> 44:13.545
Yes indeed.

44:15.447 --> 44:16.615
Can you feel the smell?

44:20.519 --> 44:24.122
When one is within
the high society-

44:24.156 --> 44:25.557
- Look what just walked in.

44:25.591 --> 44:26.858
Table manners.

44:26.892 --> 44:28.292
- Unbelievable.
- It's the sound you

44:28.927 --> 44:30.295
don't hear when you eat soup.

44:33.332 --> 44:35.534
She doesn't even know
how to use a napkin.

44:36.602 --> 44:37.402
Oops.

44:37.436 --> 44:38.570
What a klutz.

44:38.604 --> 44:40.238
Don't worry I'll get it.

44:41.273 --> 44:43.375
People sure are staring at us.

44:43.408 --> 44:45.844
Well, we won't
let that bother us.

44:45.877 --> 44:47.279
You know?

44:47.312 --> 44:48.847
That's the way you
want to play it.

44:49.983 --> 44:51.550
What are you up to?

44:51.583 --> 44:55.153
Please, this is a restaurant!

44:55.187 --> 44:56.855
Mind your manners.

44:56.888 --> 44:58.557
What on earth will people say?

44:58.590 --> 44:59.891
What did I say?

45:01.293 --> 45:02.293
Poor child.

45:11.203 --> 45:12.203
No.

45:17.809 --> 45:19.711
Can't they just leave?

45:19.745 --> 45:20.879
Like animals.

45:21.913 --> 45:22.881
Terrible.

45:22.914 --> 45:23.983
How inappropriate?

45:24.017 --> 45:25.017
I agree.

45:25.952 --> 45:29.989
Oh, put your feet on the table.

45:30.023 --> 45:31.456
You're embarrassing me.

45:31.490 --> 45:33.960
I'm sorry I forgot.

45:33.993 --> 45:35.627
Please don't be angry.

45:35.661 --> 45:36.661
Better shape up.

45:38.263 --> 45:39.665
Right, I will.

45:39.698 --> 45:40.933
I promise.

45:42.234 --> 45:45.470
See, I knew you could do it!

45:45.504 --> 45:46.973
Did you forget to
wash your hands?

45:47.006 --> 45:48.607
I sure have.

45:48.640 --> 45:49.942
Now that's a relief.

45:51.276 --> 45:52.444
Garcon, dessert!

45:54.680 --> 45:55.714
I've had enough.

45:55.747 --> 45:57.249
Let's go.

45:57.282 --> 45:58.383
Yes I agree.

46:07.859 --> 46:10.395
That's what happens
if you mess with my kid.

46:12.031 --> 46:14.000
Your kid?

46:14.033 --> 46:15.033
What did you say?

46:16.435 --> 46:18.004
I'm

46:18.037 --> 46:19.371
your kid.

46:33.318 --> 46:34.318
The door

46:35.287 --> 46:36.888
someone's opened it.

46:36.922 --> 46:38.557
What if someone's in there.

46:39.391 --> 46:40.525
Stay here.

46:40.559 --> 46:41.559
I'll take a look.

46:42.294 --> 46:43.528
I'm too scared.

46:43.562 --> 46:46.065
What if they aren't
still inside?

46:46.099 --> 46:47.967
Then they might be out here.

46:56.374 --> 46:58.577
Do you hear anything?

47:06.351 --> 47:07.352
Aron?

47:07.385 --> 47:08.653
I'll herd her off.

47:08.687 --> 47:09.687
Run!

47:10.555 --> 47:11.991
Go on

47:12.024 --> 47:13.024
start running.

47:13.892 --> 47:16.595
Aron no.

47:17.896 --> 47:18.896
No?

47:19.999 --> 47:22.400
I'm missing
something here right?

47:22.434 --> 47:23.434
Uh huh.

47:29.775 --> 47:31.777
If I had showed up sooner

47:31.810 --> 47:33.645
would you have wanted
me to save you?

47:35.514 --> 47:38.784
Maybe not save me exactly.

47:39.818 --> 47:42.320
I didn't always want to be here.

47:42.354 --> 47:43.354
But now?

47:44.389 --> 47:45.389
Now I do.

47:47.459 --> 47:48.460
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

47:48.493 --> 47:49.828
I'm sorry about the shoving.

47:49.861 --> 47:50.861
I thought...

47:51.563 --> 47:52.965
I know.

47:52.999 --> 47:53.999
It's all right.

47:55.500 --> 47:57.970
Seriously though wasn't it

47:58.004 --> 48:01.140
kind of a David and
Goliath scenario?

48:01.174 --> 48:02.174
What do you mean?

48:03.708 --> 48:08.080
Well, like an ant trying
to knock over an elephant.

48:29.434 --> 48:31.403
Maybe I could try
driving some time.

48:31.436 --> 48:33.371
Don't just try it.

48:33.405 --> 48:34.974
Follow Jonna's lead then.

48:36.474 --> 48:37.474
How?

48:38.211 --> 48:39.211
Just drive.

48:42.848 --> 48:44.683
Bye-bye.

48:44.716 --> 48:45.517
Bye-bye.

48:45.550 --> 48:46.550
See ya.

49:14.846 --> 49:17.415
"Around the world in 80 Days"?

49:17.449 --> 49:18.783
Why are they in such a hurry?

49:18.817 --> 49:20.819
Because the book
is about a race.

49:20.852 --> 49:22.154
I get that.

49:22.188 --> 49:25.490
But if they took
160 days instead,

49:25.523 --> 49:28.094
they'd see a lot
more along the way.

49:28.127 --> 49:29.594
Know what?

49:29.628 --> 49:32.999
You really should
read "Oliver Twist".

49:33.032 --> 49:36.102
The language of Dickens
is so old fashioned.

49:36.135 --> 49:39.205
They go on quests.

49:39.238 --> 49:41.107
Quests?

49:41.140 --> 49:42.174
Cool.

49:45.877 --> 49:47.179
Are you expecting anyone?

49:48.713 --> 49:50.849
It's probably just a customer.

49:50.882 --> 49:52.784
Hopefully a satisfied one.

49:54.586 --> 49:56.055
Right.

49:56.088 --> 49:58.257
I've looked into this business,
your adoption of Jenna.

49:58.291 --> 49:59.992
Jonna.

50:00.026 --> 50:01.826
And hello to you too.

50:01.860 --> 50:04.030
A less than savory transaction.

50:04.063 --> 50:05.697
So, in my capacity of chairman

50:05.730 --> 50:07.465
of the municipal
board of directors,

50:07.499 --> 50:09.901
I have convened a
committee for an inspection

50:09.936 --> 50:11.203
to determine whether or not

50:11.237 --> 50:13.705
you're fit to take
care of a child.

50:13.738 --> 50:15.874
If not, Jonna goes
back to Sunnyside.

50:15.907 --> 50:17.809
But you can't do that.

50:17.842 --> 50:18.710
Oh, can't I?

50:18.743 --> 50:21.213
Oh, oh I can't, oh.

50:21.247 --> 50:22.847
Well apparently I can.

50:24.183 --> 50:25.217
See you tomorrow.

50:26.252 --> 50:27.219
Unless...

50:27.253 --> 50:28.853
Unless what?

50:28.887 --> 50:30.889
Unless you would consider
selling this place.

50:30.922 --> 50:32.191
Not a chance.

50:32.224 --> 50:33.725
No, exactly.

50:33.758 --> 50:35.760
You don't stand a chance
of keeping little Josie.

50:35.794 --> 50:37.105
We certainly don't
have any trouble

50:37.129 --> 50:39.165
finding unsatisfactory
things here.

50:43.936 --> 50:45.271
We'll have to tidy up the place

50:45.304 --> 50:47.139
before they show up tomorrow.

51:10.762 --> 51:11.830
Welcome.

51:11.863 --> 51:13.565
Take a good look around.

51:13.598 --> 51:14.632
We have nothing to hide.

51:14.666 --> 51:16.135
Ah ha I see.

51:16.168 --> 51:18.536
Highly suspicious to
even say such a thing.

51:18.570 --> 51:20.072
Make a note of that.

51:20.106 --> 51:22.108
Of course Tord.

51:22.141 --> 51:23.943
My oh my.

51:25.311 --> 51:26.845
My oh my!

51:26.878 --> 51:28.646
Don't you agree?

51:28.680 --> 51:29.681
Make a note.

51:32.884 --> 51:34.153
No bed.

51:36.288 --> 51:38.357
The hammock is much
easier on the back.

51:38.391 --> 51:40.326
- Try it yourself.
- Ouch.

51:41.394 --> 51:42.394
No.

51:43.295 --> 51:44.163
Oh no, no, no.

51:44.196 --> 51:45.830
A bed is a requirement.

51:45.864 --> 51:47.899
And we don't push municipal
officials like that.

51:47.933 --> 51:48.933
Make a note.

51:51.770 --> 51:52.770
Sticky.

51:54.073 --> 51:55.073
Dirty.

51:55.975 --> 51:56.975
Yuck.

51:57.977 --> 52:00.812
But the food is nutritious.

52:00.845 --> 52:02.214
Vegetarian.

52:02.248 --> 52:03.782
No meat.

52:03.815 --> 52:05.293
No, no, no, no, no,
no don't write that.

52:05.317 --> 52:08.154
Write filthy dishes
and deficient diet.

52:09.355 --> 52:12.992
Argh!

52:13.025 --> 52:14.260
A trap, it was a trap.

52:14.293 --> 52:15.593
Make a note.

52:15.627 --> 52:16.996
Reading is important.

52:19.265 --> 52:23.235
An outhouse.

52:23.269 --> 52:25.337
It's very nice though.

52:27.139 --> 52:28.706
And it's very healthy

52:28.740 --> 52:31.377
to do your business
half way outdoors.

52:31.410 --> 52:32.978
Totally outdated.

52:33.012 --> 52:34.980
Children deserve
modern conveniences.

52:35.014 --> 52:36.014
Make a note.

52:39.418 --> 52:40.919
The decree will be made public

52:40.953 --> 52:42.887
at the town hall
tomorrow morning at 8:45.

52:45.424 --> 52:46.891
We'll be there.

52:46.925 --> 52:47.759
Make a note.

52:47.792 --> 52:49.894
8:45 sharp.

52:51.163 --> 52:52.630
Sharp.

53:08.913 --> 53:11.016
What are we doing here?

53:12.451 --> 53:15.753
At any rate we know
Tord's gonna vote.

53:19.724 --> 53:21.260
What's the matter?

53:21.293 --> 53:23.095
Did I do something wrong?

53:25.297 --> 53:26.297
No.

53:51.756 --> 53:54.059
You should have
brought a camera.

53:54.093 --> 53:55.394
It's nice here.

53:55.427 --> 53:58.796
Maybe we can bring one
on our next excursion.

53:58.830 --> 54:00.832
On our next quest.

54:02.334 --> 54:04.003
Come on let's make supper.

54:09.175 --> 54:12.244
It seems like I left
our food behind.

54:16.215 --> 54:17.316
Wait here.

54:41.773 --> 54:42.773
Gorilla?

54:44.243 --> 54:45.243
Gorilla?

55:00.559 --> 55:01.559
Check it out.

55:12.804 --> 55:14.073
This is yummy.

55:14.106 --> 55:17.276
Funny how everything
tastes better outdoors.

55:17.309 --> 55:19.411
I've camped out here many times.

55:21.280 --> 55:23.716
I want you to remember this.

55:25.284 --> 55:27.319
This place.

55:28.354 --> 55:30.788
No matter what happens tomorrow.

55:30.822 --> 55:31.490
All right.

55:31.523 --> 55:33.791
It's important.

55:33.825 --> 55:34.825
Promise?

55:35.927 --> 55:36.927
I promise.

55:39.331 --> 55:40.331
Come here.

55:46.171 --> 55:46.972
There it is.

55:47.006 --> 55:47.905
That star.

55:47.940 --> 55:48.974
Do you see it?

55:49.008 --> 55:51.843
That's the Ape Star.

55:51.876 --> 55:56.515
The one that sparkles
unexpectedly, like me.

55:56.548 --> 55:57.548
I can see it.

55:58.916 --> 56:00.852
One day it'll just be gone.

56:01.553 --> 56:03.788
Poof, like it never existed.

56:05.991 --> 56:07.226
How sad.

56:08.294 --> 56:09.528
Yeah sort of.

56:10.895 --> 56:12.564
But it is what it is.

56:14.066 --> 56:17.236
I don't want the Ape
Star to ever go out.

56:18.604 --> 56:19.604
It has to.

56:21.173 --> 56:24.610
Every star burns out in the end.

56:24.643 --> 56:26.278
But that's not fair.

56:27.613 --> 56:29.648
I only just found my Ape Star.

56:29.682 --> 56:32.817
But you are lucky to
have found it at all.

56:33.986 --> 56:36.588
And that the Ape
Star found you too.

56:37.623 --> 56:38.623
Mommy.

56:39.924 --> 56:41.260
Yes.

56:42.428 --> 56:44.296
Yes that's how it is.

57:27.439 --> 57:28.439
Right, well.

57:31.043 --> 57:33.345
Did anyone really expect
a gorilla and a kid

57:33.379 --> 57:35.381
nobody wants to
actually be on time?

57:38.450 --> 57:40.152
Right we're here.

57:44.056 --> 57:45.290
Excellent.

57:45.324 --> 57:46.692
Well then please be seated.

57:48.127 --> 57:49.127
So, let's see here.

57:50.229 --> 57:52.931
Inspection report
domicile of Gorilla.

57:52.965 --> 57:55.501
Well, we were all
there weren't we but

57:55.534 --> 57:58.237
I'll go straight through the
notes, if no one objects.

58:00.973 --> 58:04.276
We found unsanitary
dishes, a poor diet,

58:04.309 --> 58:08.714
wretched bathroom facilities,
aggressive literature.

58:08.747 --> 58:10.382
Aggressive literature?

58:10.416 --> 58:12.084
All those newspapers
and magazines

58:12.117 --> 58:13.986
that poured out of that
cabinet onto my head.

58:14.019 --> 58:15.954
- Yes.
- Yes, the list is long

58:15.988 --> 58:18.323
and most of it represents
things that are noteworthy

58:18.357 --> 58:19.625
but nothing serious enough

58:19.658 --> 58:21.693
to require annulment
of the adoption.

58:23.195 --> 58:25.931
Jonna would have been
allowed to stay but

58:27.366 --> 58:30.035
there have been reports
from members of the public.

58:30.068 --> 58:31.437
People shopping at the junk yard

58:31.470 --> 58:33.172
have heard Gorilla
threatening Jonna

58:33.205 --> 58:36.108
and on top of that,
she taught her

58:36.141 --> 58:38.010
to be a grifter and a cheat.

58:40.145 --> 58:42.047
But that was only pretend.

58:42.080 --> 58:43.749
Tattered and dirty clothes.

58:43.782 --> 58:46.185
We live and work
in the junkyard.

58:46.218 --> 58:47.953
- Yes.
- Child labor!

58:48.821 --> 58:50.222
You see?

58:50.255 --> 58:51.657
And here, a visit
to a restaurant

58:51.690 --> 58:53.759
where Gorilla encouraged
the girl to misbehave,

58:53.792 --> 58:55.727
to openly flout rules and norms.

58:55.761 --> 58:58.397
47 witnesses saw how
Gorilla encouraged Jonna

58:58.430 --> 58:59.798
to eat with her hands.

58:59.832 --> 59:02.034
47.

59:02.067 --> 59:04.203
No, this

59:05.737 --> 59:09.107
this ape is not fit to
take care of a child.

59:13.612 --> 59:15.747
Okay you win.

59:15.781 --> 59:17.716
- Do whatever you want.
- What?

59:17.749 --> 59:19.284
I win, I win.

59:19.318 --> 59:20.552
Do what I want?

59:20.586 --> 59:22.588
All I want is to
protect the child.

59:22.621 --> 59:24.590
Everyone knows that isn't true.

59:27.092 --> 59:29.027
Let me keep Jonna

59:29.061 --> 59:33.732
and you can have the land
and build your aqua park.

59:34.633 --> 59:36.301
Yes you all heard it,

59:36.335 --> 59:38.237
Gorilla is selling her property.

59:39.738 --> 59:43.175
Allowing renewal, the future
and common sense to prevail.

59:43.208 --> 59:44.208
Bravo.

59:44.776 --> 59:46.712
But one condition.

59:46.745 --> 59:48.380
Jonna stays with me.

59:49.381 --> 59:51.183
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

59:51.216 --> 59:52.827
In front of everybody here, of
course I promise, I promise.

59:52.851 --> 59:54.286
Absolutely.

59:59.424 --> 1:00:01.527
Here's the contract,

1:00:01.560 --> 1:00:02.694
here's a pen.

1:00:03.595 --> 1:00:04.763
Sign on the dotted line.

1:00:05.831 --> 1:00:07.766
You're getting it very cheap.

1:00:07.799 --> 1:00:09.401
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:00:09.434 --> 1:00:11.270
- Do you want to keep Jonna?
- All right.

1:00:17.142 --> 1:00:18.076
Come along.

1:00:18.110 --> 1:00:19.411
What are you doing?

1:00:19.444 --> 1:00:20.779
Let me go!

1:00:20.812 --> 1:00:22.180
I'm not going with you!

1:00:22.214 --> 1:00:23.749
Hey wait a minute.

1:00:23.782 --> 1:00:25.350
Come on, you couldn't
possibly believe

1:00:25.384 --> 1:00:27.886
I would allow Jonna to
wallow in a junk yard

1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:29.788
with a wild beast.

1:00:29.821 --> 1:00:31.456
You tricked us!

1:00:31.490 --> 1:00:32.558
No, no, no, no.

1:00:32.591 --> 1:00:34.259
Not at all.

1:00:34.293 --> 1:00:35.470
I saved a poor, defenseless
child from a monster.

1:00:35.494 --> 1:00:36.654
- What are you doing?
- Mommy!

1:00:38.297 --> 1:00:39.164
Mommy!

1:00:39.197 --> 1:00:41.300
No, no Jonna, Jonna!

1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:44.736
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:00:44.770 --> 1:00:46.538
Jonna!

1:00:47.139 --> 1:00:48.139
Jonna.

1:00:54.479 --> 1:00:58.450
Good morning my dear.

1:00:58.483 --> 1:00:59.418
Gorilla?

1:00:59.451 --> 1:01:01.219
It's okay Jonna.

1:01:01.253 --> 1:01:02.454
Just forget her.

1:01:05.557 --> 1:01:07.626
Things got a bit crazy

1:01:07.659 --> 1:01:11.196
but why don't we put
all that behind us?

1:01:12.197 --> 1:01:13.197
Okay?

1:01:13.899 --> 1:01:15.667
You're back home.

1:01:16.568 --> 1:01:18.370
The junk yard is my home.

1:01:21.306 --> 1:01:23.842
You won't have
to live there now.

1:01:24.743 --> 1:01:26.178
That's where I belong.

1:01:27.379 --> 1:01:28.413
With Gorilla.

1:01:31.783 --> 1:01:35.854
You want to live with that ape?

1:01:39.191 --> 1:01:40.325
She's my mommy.

1:01:42.561 --> 1:01:44.396
There you go, the
gorilla flew the coop.

1:01:46.231 --> 1:01:48.433
She would never leave me.

1:01:48.467 --> 1:01:50.302
Well take a look at this.

1:01:53.205 --> 1:01:54.206
Dear Jonna,

1:01:54.239 --> 1:01:56.842
I decided to leave town.

1:01:56.875 --> 1:01:58.810
There's no future for me here.

1:02:06.885 --> 1:02:08.620
There's some more
scribbling here.

1:02:08.654 --> 1:02:10.155
The Ape Star.

1:02:11.356 --> 1:02:12.491
Her a star, hardly.

1:02:21.633 --> 1:02:22.969
Yes.

1:02:23.002 --> 1:02:26.204
So what about Sunnyside?

1:02:26.238 --> 1:02:27.472
What about it?

1:02:27.506 --> 1:02:30.509
I assume that we get to stay on.

1:02:30.542 --> 1:02:33.211
Oh well...

1:02:33.245 --> 1:02:34.246
Well?

1:02:34.279 --> 1:02:35.814
No, absolutely not.

1:02:35.847 --> 1:02:38.583
So you intend to
build your aqua park-

1:02:38.617 --> 1:02:40.652
- No we abandoned that
plan a long time ago.

1:02:40.686 --> 1:02:42.454
Then we should
be able to stay on.

1:02:42.487 --> 1:02:44.222
The city can't
support operations

1:02:44.256 --> 1:02:45.624
that are a drain on the budget.

1:02:46.558 --> 1:02:48.293
But what about the children?

1:02:49.461 --> 1:02:51.030
So we'll see.

1:02:57.003 --> 1:02:58.403
Don't be sad.

1:02:58.437 --> 1:02:59.939
After all, a gorilla
is a gorilla.

1:03:01.074 --> 1:03:03.875
I've given up on all
that family stuff.

1:03:03.909 --> 1:03:05.711
I'm not a cute little kid.

1:03:05.744 --> 1:03:06.946
No one will ever want me.

1:03:09.281 --> 1:03:10.281
Hey you.

1:03:10.983 --> 1:03:12.718
It's fine, really.

1:03:12.751 --> 1:03:15.253
I've been thinking about
working at the orphanage.

1:03:15.287 --> 1:03:16.621
When I get older.

1:03:16.655 --> 1:03:19.058
Be like a dad to all the
kids who don't have one.

1:03:19.092 --> 1:03:20.525
Like Giovanni.

1:03:20.559 --> 1:03:22.728
Guess what, it's
that door again.

1:03:22.761 --> 1:03:24.329
Really doesn't make
any sense at all.

1:03:24.362 --> 1:03:25.464
The door?

1:03:25.497 --> 1:03:26.497
Again?

1:03:27.532 --> 1:03:28.532
Looks good.

1:03:30.103 --> 1:03:32.370
Aron will put me out of my job.

1:03:35.074 --> 1:03:36.608
You should call someone

1:03:36.641 --> 1:03:38.443
who could come over
and catch the badger.

1:03:38.477 --> 1:03:41.413
I wonder if it
really is a badger.

1:03:41.446 --> 1:03:43.281
Badgers would take
anything they could eat,

1:03:43.315 --> 1:03:45.684
not just eggs and chili peppers.

1:03:45.717 --> 1:03:47.019
Maybe you're right.

1:03:47.053 --> 1:03:48.920
I don't know anything
about animals.

1:04:16.149 --> 1:04:17.649
Are you taking off?

1:04:17.682 --> 1:04:19.085
Yeah.

1:04:19.118 --> 1:04:20.118
Don't tell anyone.

1:04:22.155 --> 1:04:23.055
Sure.

1:04:23.089 --> 1:04:24.456
Goodbye.

1:04:24.489 --> 1:04:25.489
Jonna

1:04:26.125 --> 1:04:27.559
keep in touch okay?

1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:29.895
You can count on it.

1:04:59.891 --> 1:05:00.891
Mom?

1:05:05.164 --> 1:05:06.164
Mommy?

1:05:12.071 --> 1:05:13.071
Mommy?

1:05:16.175 --> 1:05:17.776
I thought...

1:05:20.645 --> 1:05:22.380
Hi there.

1:05:25.817 --> 1:05:26.818
Oo there.

1:05:27.719 --> 1:05:28.920
All right then.

1:05:31.423 --> 1:05:35.094
It's time for our quest.

1:05:58.450 --> 1:06:01.519
Listen, we only have time to
get the most important things.

1:06:02.654 --> 1:06:04.123
I want to take my bike.

1:06:05.891 --> 1:06:07.659
What are you going to take?

1:06:07.692 --> 1:06:09.128
What's most important to you?

1:06:11.197 --> 1:06:13.132
Well, I don't know.

1:06:15.234 --> 1:06:17.103
Your books!

1:06:17.136 --> 1:06:18.436
Oh you're right.

1:06:18.470 --> 1:06:20.206
Only there are so many.

1:06:20.239 --> 1:06:22.074
More than 3000.

1:06:22.108 --> 1:06:23.508
We don't have time for that

1:06:23.541 --> 1:06:25.177
and we don't have
room in the car.

1:06:25.211 --> 1:06:26.745
Let's get going.

1:06:26.778 --> 1:06:28.880
And I know how we can
bring them with us.

1:06:37.789 --> 1:06:39.891
If you hook it up,
I'll pack the books.

1:06:40.825 --> 1:06:42.527
We won't have time for that.

1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:43.561
Come on!

1:06:43.595 --> 1:06:44.875
We have time if we stop talking.

1:06:48.566 --> 1:06:49.566
There, that's good.

1:06:51.003 --> 1:06:52.003
Great.

1:06:57.043 --> 1:06:58.177
Let's do this.

1:07:01.813 --> 1:07:04.250
That's it, nice.

1:07:04.283 --> 1:07:05.483
Now let's go.

1:07:05.517 --> 1:07:07.186
Just one last thing.

1:07:12.524 --> 1:07:14.793
This is where you're hiding.

1:07:14.826 --> 1:07:15.995
Gorilla!

1:07:16.028 --> 1:07:17.129
Help!

1:07:17.163 --> 1:07:18.097
Help!

1:07:18.130 --> 1:07:19.464
Not so fast!

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.168
Help!

1:07:22.201 --> 1:07:23.902
Mommy!

1:07:23.936 --> 1:07:25.104
Jonna!

1:07:25.137 --> 1:07:26.205
Let go of her!

1:07:27.539 --> 1:07:28.540
Ow!

1:07:37.149 --> 1:07:38.650
Gorilla stop it!

1:07:39.352 --> 1:07:40.352
No!

1:07:41.253 --> 1:07:42.989
Gorilla let him go.

1:07:50.329 --> 1:07:51.329
Mommy!

1:07:54.333 --> 1:07:56.135
Mommy!

1:07:56.168 --> 1:07:56.969
Let go.

1:07:57.003 --> 1:07:58.003
Stop it.

1:08:02.241 --> 1:08:03.241
You?

1:08:05.077 --> 1:08:06.077
But why?

1:08:07.313 --> 1:08:09.248
Because you belong together.

1:08:10.915 --> 1:08:12.251
Go on, leave.

1:08:12.284 --> 1:08:13.953
I'll take care of Tord.

1:08:17.356 --> 1:08:18.356
You better drive.

1:08:20.592 --> 1:08:21.760
What!

1:08:21.793 --> 1:08:22.794
Is Jonna driving?

1:08:22.827 --> 1:08:25.331
Oh well, get going you two.

1:08:25.364 --> 1:08:27.866
I don't want to know
more about all this.

1:08:27.899 --> 1:08:30.735
Then we shouldn't tell
you where we're going.

1:08:30.769 --> 1:08:31.769
Just go.

1:08:39.711 --> 1:08:41.880
What's so funny?

1:08:43.882 --> 1:08:46.785
I didn't sign that
contract properly.

1:08:48.421 --> 1:08:51.991
Amazing how squiggly
gorilla hands can write.

1:08:56.095 --> 1:08:58.730
I expect it will be
difficult for Tord

1:08:58.763 --> 1:09:01.033
to get his grubby
hands on the land

1:09:01.067 --> 1:09:04.103
if they can't locate the owner.

1:09:05.337 --> 1:09:07.306
Farewell Tord!

1:09:07.339 --> 1:09:08.941
Farewell Gerd!

1:09:08.974 --> 1:09:10.608
Farewell!

1:09:10.642 --> 1:09:12.677
Hello quest.

1:09:12.710 --> 1:09:14.779
Farewell!

1:09:14.813 --> 1:09:15.813
Goodbye.

1:09:34.666 --> 1:09:36.969
Hi, just wanted to let
you know how we're doing

1:09:37.002 --> 1:09:38.803
so you won't be worried.

1:09:38.837 --> 1:09:41.840
We go swimming in
the sea every day.

1:09:41.873 --> 1:09:43.641
This is a picture
of Gorilla and me

1:09:43.675 --> 1:09:45.710
in front of the bookmobile.

1:09:45.743 --> 1:09:47.846
Business is booming.

1:09:47.879 --> 1:09:48.913
Bye for now.

1:09:48.948 --> 1:09:50.782
See you around some day.

1:09:51.783 --> 1:09:53.385
Jonna, Gorilla's daughter.

1:09:55.121 --> 1:09:56.788
Oh Jonna.

1:09:59.924 --> 1:10:02.927
All right people
it's fun Friday.

1:10:02.962 --> 1:10:05.763
So let's have fun.

1:10:05.797 --> 1:10:07.233
- Here!
- Come on.

1:10:07.266 --> 1:10:08.266
Pass it to me!

1:10:39.731 --> 1:10:41.267
One of your official duties

1:10:41.300 --> 1:10:43.969
is to find homes for these
poor souls, isn't that so?

1:10:45.037 --> 1:10:47.072
Things got a bit crazy.

1:10:50.209 --> 1:10:51.410
But now...

1:10:55.747 --> 1:10:57.149
Just pulled her.

1:10:57.183 --> 1:10:59.351
Like when you're urging
someone to hurry up.
