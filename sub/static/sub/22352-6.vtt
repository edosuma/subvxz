WEBVTT

00:10.051 --> 00:13.138
[panting and moaning]

00:17.225 --> 00:18.393
[shushing]

00:20.186 --> 00:21.396
[moans]

00:22.230 --> 00:24.190
Shh. [groans]
Shh, shh...

00:26.443 --> 00:28.486
What? You afraid somebody's gonna hear?

00:32.782 --> 00:34.034
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:37.245 --> 00:40.081
[moaning and panting]

00:45.837 --> 00:47.505
Ah, yeah.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.382
[camera clicks]

00:57.432 --> 01:00.935
Just, uh, seafood-- seafood inspection.
Everything's fresh.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.198
So...

01:16.117 --> 01:18.119
Any update
on the partnership announcement?

01:19.829 --> 01:22.415
They don't tell me these things.
But don't worry about it.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.834
I got your back. You're good.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.047
I don't want to get screwed over.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.298
Stefanie...

01:32.050 --> 01:35.345
I got you.
I take care of my people, okay?

01:36.054 --> 01:36.888
You're good.

01:38.264 --> 01:39.432
Trust me.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.352
Tell you what.
You get the Chilean sea bass.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.395
I will get the lamb and we will share.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.899
We can share each other's plates.

01:48.858 --> 01:49.692
Hmm?

01:56.825 --> 01:57.909
Do you remember me?

01:57.992 --> 01:59.452
No, and if you don't mind,

01:59.536 --> 02:01.287
you're interrupting
a private conversation here.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.547
- Mr. Hayes.
- [man] That's right.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.299
- Do you want me to get the waiter?
- No, no, it's okay.

02:14.759 --> 02:18.179
- [sighs]
- I went by your office...

02:18.263 --> 02:21.933
and your assistant said
that you were at a business lunch.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.393
As you can see that I am.

02:23.476 --> 02:27.897
Now, Mr. Hayes, please, if you will,
I've told you before,

02:27.981 --> 02:31.401
you need to talk to the prosecutors,
not me.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.238
Your client... killed my son.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.826
And you, you helped him get away with it.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.163
Look at you.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.417
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:49.919 --> 02:54.257
this is Mr. Hotshot Lawyer,
Mark Rankin!

02:55.717 --> 02:58.511
This is the man that helped
some drunk asshole

02:58.595 --> 03:00.430
get away with killing my son!

03:00.513 --> 03:02.765
- Okay, time to go.
- Get your fuckin' hands off me!

03:06.477 --> 03:08.187
Listen, if you want to blame somebody,

03:08.271 --> 03:10.815
you blame the police
that screwed up the roadside stop.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.360
You blame the techs who waited 20 hours
to do a blood test on my client.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.322
Your case was built on a lie. A lie!

03:17.405 --> 03:20.074
This man is a liar!

03:20.158 --> 03:23.369
I was doing my job and I did it well.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.290
Now go home.
You're embarrassing yourself.

03:31.669 --> 03:32.670
Everything's fine.

03:35.590 --> 03:36.883
Whew.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.137
Are you okay?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.222
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:45.141 --> 03:46.601
- Sure you still want to be partner?
- [gunshot]

03:47.560 --> 03:49.562
[screaming and yelling]

03:53.149 --> 03:55.151
I promised Dylan.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.488
My son.

03:58.571 --> 03:59.405
I swore...

04:01.366 --> 04:04.160
that I would get him the justice
that he deserved.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.583
[screams]

04:11.334 --> 04:14.379
[panting and groaning]

04:16.214 --> 04:18.049
[sniffles] And then...

04:18.132 --> 04:20.802
[sobbing]

04:25.098 --> 04:26.432
we'd see each other again.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.242
How the hell did this happen?

04:44.993 --> 04:47.662
No one would just fall
into a goddamn fire.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.836
- [gasping]
- He's alive!

04:54.919 --> 04:56.671
[Keira] No, wait, Peter! Don't touch him!

04:57.797 --> 05:00.174
Okay, we need to cool the wounds
and warm the body.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.093
I need wet towels
and I need something warm

05:02.176 --> 05:04.053
to wrap his body in,
a blanket or a duvet.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.014
We're gonna get you out of this.
Okay, buddy?

05:06.097 --> 05:07.932
You're gonna be okay.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.058
Okay.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.226
Noah.

05:10.310 --> 05:15.273
Noah, if you can hear me,
you have to stay awake, okay?

05:15.356 --> 05:17.442
- I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?
- [gurgling]

05:20.278 --> 05:22.488
[groaning]

05:25.867 --> 05:27.285
Be careful, Judith, not too much.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.330
- Easy! Easy! Easy!
- [Noah screams]

05:30.413 --> 05:31.831
It doesn't make sense.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.375
The killer, the guy
who's been hunting us down is dead.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.252
Yeah, well, clearly,
Glen wasn't our guy.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.713
Don't worry. We're going to get you
through this, buddy. Don't worry.

05:38.796 --> 05:41.132
You're gonna get him through this?
Look at the guy. He'd be better off dead.

05:41.215 --> 05:42.967
[Dawn] Oh, God, I think I'm gonna be sick.

05:43.051 --> 05:46.387
You're a fighter. Your friends are right.
You're gonna pull through.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.181
Okay. We've got to get these ones, okay?

05:48.264 --> 05:49.140
Ready?

05:49.724 --> 05:51.934
Squeeze my hand. Squeeze my hand.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.020
[groans and screams]

06:00.610 --> 06:02.195
[muffled scream]

06:02.278 --> 06:03.112
Hey.

06:04.405 --> 06:09.911
Excuse me.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.913
[footsteps approaching]

06:17.126 --> 06:20.129
Hey, we're gonna get through this, okay?

06:23.591 --> 06:25.009
[sobbing]

06:35.895 --> 06:38.314
[panting and wheezing]

06:50.284 --> 06:52.161
[wheezing breathing]

07:03.881 --> 07:06.717
- [wheezing]
- Should he sound like that?

07:08.386 --> 07:11.013
- Noah's not a snorer.
- He's not snoring.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.683
He's not sleeping. He's in pain.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.231
Noah's airway is compromised.

07:20.314 --> 07:24.902
He needs a breathing tube, oxygen,
intravenous pain meds.

07:25.486 --> 07:29.782
He needs to be in a hospital,
not a shack in the middle of the woods.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.617
You're the only thing
keeping him alive, Keira.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.915
[motor humming outside]

07:40.918 --> 07:43.337
- Do you guys hear that?
- [Keira] Is that a plane?

07:45.006 --> 07:46.090
Damn right it is.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.467
[airplane droning]

07:47.550 --> 07:48.676
- Hey!
- Hey!

07:48.759 --> 07:50.386
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey!

07:50.470 --> 07:51.846
- Help!
- Come on!

07:51.929 --> 07:53.431
- Help!
- Look down here!

07:53.514 --> 07:54.765
Hey!

07:54.849 --> 07:56.434
- Hey!
- Hey!

07:56.517 --> 07:59.645
- Hey! No, no!
- Did they see us?

07:59.729 --> 08:00.813
Fuck!

08:01.856 --> 08:04.442
Wouldn't they have, like, dipped
their wing or circled back or something?

08:06.152 --> 08:08.779
- They have to come back.
- What? Why?

08:08.863 --> 08:10.573
Because how many airports
are there around here?

08:10.656 --> 08:12.033
There can't be that many, right?

08:12.116 --> 08:14.660
Right, but for all we know they're
on a one-way trip back to civilization.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.579
Maybe. Maybe not.

08:17.747 --> 08:18.831
We need to be ready.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.720
[grunts]

08:34.805 --> 08:36.516
Hey. What do you think?

08:37.934 --> 08:41.646
The plane should be able to see it soon
as they clear the trees, any direction.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.439
Looks big enough.
[panting]

08:44.273 --> 08:45.441
And I had one more idea.

08:46.609 --> 08:50.821
I wanna build three bonfires, you know,
like, old-fashioned smoke signals...

08:52.114 --> 08:53.741
to attract the planes
to come over this way.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.035
You might have to go a little further
to get to the big green pieces

08:56.118 --> 08:57.828
so that it'll make smoke.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.039
- Are you gonna be okay out here?
- I'll be fine.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.457
Don't go too far.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.631
[Peter sighs]

09:15.680 --> 09:17.390
[grunting and wheezing]

09:28.401 --> 09:29.402
It's Monday.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.113
They were supposed to go back today.

09:33.489 --> 09:37.076
When they don't, people will wonder,
and they'll come looking for them.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.037
[wheezing and moaning]

09:40.705 --> 09:42.456
And we can return to our lives.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.084
Some of us can.

09:46.961 --> 09:50.089
These people who died won't be returning
to their lives any time soon,

09:50.172 --> 09:51.674
and the rest of us, well...

09:53.634 --> 09:54.927
We won't be the same again.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.058
He's dying.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.478
So?

10:06.147 --> 10:08.524
- He's a human being, Wren.
- No.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.651
Judith, he's a piece of shit.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.614
Him and his friends,
they killed that girl.

10:15.865 --> 10:20.578
Look, even if they did,
what happened to them, to us, it's wrong.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.623
Yeah, you're damn right.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.500
We're paying a price for what they did,
and so maybe a slow, painful death

10:26.584 --> 10:28.502
is exactly what
this piece of shit deserves.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.587
Jesus, Wren.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.382
Listen to what you're saying.
Listen to yourself.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.973
This poor boy doesn't deserve
what happened to him.

10:42.767 --> 10:43.809
No one does.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.938
Karma disagrees with you.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.069
[wheezing, labored breathing]

11:08.876 --> 11:11.921
I miss the sound of traffic,
and streetcars,

11:12.004 --> 11:15.633
and raccoons hunting through my garbage.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.343
It's like it's too quiet here.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.053
[rustling]

11:25.267 --> 11:27.478
Dawn! Dawn, put that away!

11:27.561 --> 11:28.979
Shh!

11:29.063 --> 11:30.189
- Dawn.
- I have a gun!

11:30.272 --> 11:32.858
- Dawn! Dawn!
- Do you hear me? I have a gun!

11:34.527 --> 11:36.654
What? Fuck! [screams]

11:36.737 --> 11:37.738
What? What? What?!

11:37.822 --> 11:39.657
- Aaah! Fuck!
- Shit!

11:39.740 --> 11:42.410
- Help me, help me, help me!
- It's okay, it's okay, it's okay!

11:42.493 --> 11:43.327
Okay, okay!

11:44.412 --> 11:45.913
[grunting]

11:47.039 --> 11:49.625
- [screams and whimpers]
- Come on, help me! Help me!

11:49.708 --> 11:51.669
- Do it! Help me, help me!
- [grunting]

11:51.752 --> 11:53.504
I'm helping you! I am fucking helping you!

11:53.587 --> 11:55.256
I can't do it by myself!

11:55.339 --> 11:56.799
- Then go get help! Go get help!
- Okay.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.384
- I'll be back!
- Go!

11:58.467 --> 11:59.760
- I'll be back!
- Go!

11:59.844 --> 12:02.763
[whimpers and sobs]

12:10.312 --> 12:12.314
Fuck it. Fuck it.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.570
Please, please, please.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.160
[breathless scream]

12:25.077 --> 12:26.829
Fuck! Fuck!

12:27.705 --> 12:28.873
- [rustling]
- [panting]

12:34.545 --> 12:36.297
- [clatter]
- Aaah!

12:36.380 --> 12:37.923
Jesus, Dawn! Dawn, it's me!

12:39.049 --> 12:40.509
I'm so sorry!

12:40.593 --> 12:42.845
What happened? Oh, Jesus.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.015
- [sobbing] I'm so sorry.
- God!

12:46.098 --> 12:48.309
- I'm so sorry. I almost killed you.
- It's all right.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.769
You're in horrible shock.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.771
- I heard a gunshot.
- Come here!

12:53.772 --> 12:54.982
Grab the other side of this.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.734
Pull on three. On three, pull.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.611
- You get ready to pull your leg out.
- Okay, okay.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.196
One, two, three!

13:00.279 --> 13:02.072
[grunting]

13:05.326 --> 13:08.621
- [sobbing]
- Shh, shh. Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

13:17.546 --> 13:20.341
[groaning and wincing]

13:20.424 --> 13:22.843
[gasps and winces]

13:25.095 --> 13:27.264
Fuck. Karen, Karen, is it broken?

13:30.392 --> 13:31.435
Okay.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.103
Is it broken--?
[screams]

13:33.187 --> 13:35.147
Fuck! You fucking did that on purpose!

13:35.231 --> 13:37.608
It's the only way to tell
if it's broken or not!

13:37.691 --> 13:38.817
Fuck! Fuck!

13:38.901 --> 13:41.028
It's not!

13:41.111 --> 13:43.572
Okay, this is gonna hurt even more,
but I need to clean the wound

13:43.656 --> 13:45.241
so that it doesn't get infected.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.951
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

13:47.034 --> 13:48.994
You sadistic little cunt.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.412
Fuck!

13:50.496 --> 13:52.206
[sharp inhale and groan]

13:52.289 --> 13:55.167
Okay. The worst is over.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.462
It's not broken. It doesn't look like
it hit anything vital.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.172
This bandage should fix it up, okay?

14:03.217 --> 14:05.177
In a week or so, you'll be fine, okay?

14:06.262 --> 14:08.639
Yeah, if I'm alive in a week.

14:08.722 --> 14:11.725
Well, if you die,
it won't be because of infection.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.316
Okay.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.360
Take two of these.
They have codeine in them.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.197
One good thing Glen, or Benny,
or whatever the hell his name was,

14:25.281 --> 14:26.365
brought to the community.

14:31.620 --> 14:35.749
Fuck. A psycho killer is on the loose
and I'm injured and groggy.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.044
Are you sure?

14:41.505 --> 14:44.383
I might regret this, but yeah.

14:45.843 --> 14:46.844
Okay.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.223
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

14:53.767 --> 14:54.852
Let me get this cleaned up.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.355
Okay.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.150
Hey.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.652
Would you stay--
would you stay for a minute?

15:09.283 --> 15:10.284
Yeah.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.128
How are you?

15:22.087 --> 15:23.297
[groans] Um...

15:25.174 --> 15:27.718
I wanted to say...

15:30.846 --> 15:34.391
You know, when you come from money,
people think that you have it all,

15:34.475 --> 15:37.061
and that you don't need anything.

15:40.064 --> 15:44.526
But what people don't get is that,
when you're seen as not needing anything,

15:46.445 --> 15:47.780
you're basically ignored.

15:51.575 --> 15:53.160
Like, no one comes looking for you.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.040
But you did.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.293
So I just wanted to say thank you.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.965
I'll always come looking for you.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.272
Would you stay with me?

16:25.401 --> 16:26.402
Okay.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.843
I don't want to die here.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.683
I'll keep you safe.

16:59.977 --> 17:00.978
I promise.

17:11.822 --> 17:14.199
[footsteps approaching]

17:18.495 --> 17:20.664
When was the last time you slept?

17:20.748 --> 17:22.207
I'm used to long shifts.

17:23.792 --> 17:24.793
Go grab some sleep.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.882
I need you at full strength.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.512
[wheezing and groaning]

17:39.099 --> 17:40.100
That girl...

17:42.227 --> 17:43.437
Did you guys kill her?

17:46.982 --> 17:48.275
Maybe it was an accident...

17:49.401 --> 17:51.111
but maybe it was something more than that.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.156
You're asking me if I'm a killer?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.077
Or Dawn?

18:01.747 --> 18:02.956
And we're going around...

18:04.917 --> 18:07.836
killing your friends, our friends?

18:07.920 --> 18:08.962
Someone has been.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.258
Peter...

18:13.342 --> 18:14.343
did you kill her?

18:17.137 --> 18:18.138
Peter.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.725
Hey, hey. I'm right here. I'm right here.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.603
Blame me.

18:27.064 --> 18:27.898
What?

18:30.150 --> 18:31.985
When you get out...

18:35.114 --> 18:37.950
just tell the police it was me.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.044
- Talvinder--
- Stop, stop.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.509
I assaulted her.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.146
It's all on me.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.032
It's all on me.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.214
Is that true?

19:38.302 --> 19:40.387
[labored breathing]

19:57.738 --> 19:59.615
[no audio]

20:11.126 --> 20:13.545
- [gunshots]
- [yelling and screaming]

20:13.629 --> 20:16.548
You said you would keep me safe.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.925
I'm sorry.

20:18.508 --> 20:19.718
You promised.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.387
[gasps]

20:25.265 --> 20:27.434
[panting]

20:32.439 --> 20:34.399
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.204
[Noah, wheezing breaths]

20:50.457 --> 20:52.542
[labored breathing, groans]

21:02.386 --> 21:05.097
[muffled groaning]

21:05.180 --> 21:06.723
One of us here is a killer.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.814
We all know it's true.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.403
Keira, can you come
join us in here, please?

21:22.990 --> 21:23.824
What is it?

21:25.325 --> 21:26.535
Noah needs me right now.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.412
Just sit for a minute, please.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.045
What most of you already know
about me is that...

21:37.129 --> 21:39.089
in a previous life, I was an attorney.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.428
What you don't know,
what I didn't tell you,

21:46.013 --> 21:49.349
is that I was paid very, very well...

21:50.851 --> 21:52.894
to be a tough son of a bitch.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.063
I loved the game of it.

21:55.147 --> 21:59.109
I kind of got off on it
because I was really, really good.

22:00.110 --> 22:05.699
And I'm not gonna sit around here
waiting, doing nothing until rescue.

22:05.782 --> 22:08.535
I need to use my skills...

22:10.120 --> 22:12.080
and question each and every one of you,

22:13.874 --> 22:16.418
until I can suss out
exactly who the killer is.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.962
I'm sorry.
Are you playing lawyer or judge here?

22:19.046 --> 22:21.423
Yeah, this is, uh, pretty fucked up, Mark.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.675
Why should you be the one
to ask the questions, Mark?

22:23.759 --> 22:25.677
And then how do we know
you're not the killer?

22:25.761 --> 22:27.804
You don't, do you?

22:27.888 --> 22:30.807
I'm sorry but that's not how
this community works.

22:30.891 --> 22:33.685
We do not question each other
at the behest of one person.

22:33.769 --> 22:37.773
Why are you so afraid
of a few little questions, Renee?

22:37.856 --> 22:41.985
Is it because you, with those hands,

22:43.111 --> 22:47.407
just tortured and brutally slaughtered
an innocent man?

22:51.661 --> 22:54.539
I'm not putting myself above you,

22:54.623 --> 22:56.374
but I have experience in these matters,

22:56.458 --> 23:00.128
and my experience tells me
that the only way that we  will  survive

23:00.212 --> 23:04.716
is by finding this killer
and stopping him, or her,

23:04.800 --> 23:06.802
before they kill again.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.765
And if I refuse?

23:11.848 --> 23:13.350
You have the right to do that...

23:15.227 --> 23:17.813
but I have to say
it'll just make you look guilty.

23:18.396 --> 23:21.191
Oh, seriously? That's where we're at?
We don't follow the herd.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.276
We're just guilty. You're a fascist, Mark.

23:23.360 --> 23:27.197
If we do this,
you have to participate too.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.241
Oh, you're gonna--?
You're not gonna fight this, Peter?

23:29.324 --> 23:32.035
He's right.
You're just as much of a suspect.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.745
I say we put it to a vote.

23:33.829 --> 23:37.374
No more votes. No more votes!

23:37.457 --> 23:39.167
You don't get to decide for us, Mark.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.294
[heavy breaths]

23:47.676 --> 23:49.386
All right. This is how it's gonna be.

23:49.469 --> 23:52.556
Dawn will represent our guests.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.182
I'll represent the rest of us,

23:54.266 --> 23:57.394
and when I'm finished questioning
all of you, Dawn can question me.

23:57.477 --> 23:58.311
Fair?

23:59.312 --> 24:02.691
- I can live with that.
- [Mark] Good. It's settled.

24:04.818 --> 24:08.405
I'll go get Dawn.
Keira, let's start with you.

24:09.447 --> 24:10.448
Great.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.954
Where were you when Andi was killed?

24:16.037 --> 24:18.373
- In my room.
- Alone?

24:18.456 --> 24:20.959
Where were  you ?
You were the last one to see her alive.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.925
Yeah, I was alone. I was reading.

24:30.969 --> 24:34.097
I don't have any witnesses, just my word,

24:35.807 --> 24:37.184
which I thought meant something.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.278
You used to be an ER nurse
before you came here.

24:49.529 --> 24:50.947
Yes.

24:51.031 --> 24:53.867
So you're familiar with knives
and you're not bothered by gore.

24:53.950 --> 24:54.993
I didn't kill them.

24:57.495 --> 24:58.622
Why did you leave nursing?

25:05.629 --> 25:08.673
- Keira?
- What does that have to do with anything?

25:08.757 --> 25:12.260
I don't know yet, but if it was nothing,
you would have told me.

25:13.470 --> 25:17.515
So something important,
something relevant... must have happened.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.604
Keira, you need to answer him.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.192
A patient died on my watch...

25:29.778 --> 25:31.279
because of something I did.

25:32.614 --> 25:33.531
On purpose?

25:33.615 --> 25:35.075
No, not on purpose.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.410
How did he die?

25:43.458 --> 25:44.459
[sighs] I...

25:46.253 --> 25:48.004
I was on the floor something like, uh...

25:50.340 --> 25:52.676
[sighs] 13 hours, and...

25:54.594 --> 25:56.221
a patient came in and, um...

25:58.682 --> 26:01.601
God, I made a stupid, stupid mistake. I...

26:03.561 --> 26:07.440
I-- I pushed a dose of potassium
instead of dripping it, and...

26:10.694 --> 26:13.738
by the time I realized what I had done,
it was too late.

26:13.822 --> 26:14.823
I...

26:16.616 --> 26:17.617
She was dead.

26:23.957 --> 26:25.583
I wasn't fired or anything. I just...

26:26.584 --> 26:27.585
I...

26:29.129 --> 26:31.381
I couldn't keep doing the work, you know.
I was...

26:32.299 --> 26:33.717
[sighs]

26:35.385 --> 26:36.803
I was really lost.

26:42.183 --> 26:43.435
God, then I came here.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.650
Well, I asked you in here first, Keira,

26:50.734 --> 26:53.361
because you have the medical expertise
to pull off these killings.

26:55.488 --> 26:58.408
But what you don't have
that I can see is...

26:58.491 --> 26:59.909
is the motive.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.203
[sobs]

27:02.287 --> 27:03.288
Can I go?

27:06.166 --> 27:08.543
[sighs]

27:08.626 --> 27:09.753
Send the next person in.

27:11.629 --> 27:13.757
I don't know. Maybe if you guys
want to ask me a question

27:13.840 --> 27:18.345
that's not insulting or, uh, leading,
maybe I'll answer you.

27:21.681 --> 27:25.393
You want me to be open-hearted,
share my truth with you.

27:25.477 --> 27:26.478
Okay, I will.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.356
I never liked you.

27:31.399 --> 27:33.360
I didn't from the first time I saw you.

27:35.904 --> 27:40.658
Because I can see through all your shit,
all of your arrogant, entitled...

27:40.742 --> 27:42.035
- Judith.
- Bullshit.

27:44.120 --> 27:44.954
Please sit down.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.172
I think we're all a little on edge.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.466
Yeah.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.393
The presence of these outsiders
really upset you.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.562
Didn't it, Judith?

28:16.027 --> 28:17.612
That doesn't mean I murdered them...

28:19.656 --> 28:21.491
and our friends.

28:21.574 --> 28:23.868
Mark, that's ludicrous.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.036
[Dawn] Is it?

28:25.620 --> 28:27.163
I don't really know anything about you.

28:28.581 --> 28:30.208
Well, you just got here.

28:30.291 --> 28:35.255
Right, and all I know is that you act
like some kind of den mother,

28:35.338 --> 28:40.301
all Zen and calm
and one with the universe, but is that it?

28:40.385 --> 28:42.512
Is that really all there is to you?

28:47.434 --> 28:49.310
This is ridiculous. I won't do this.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.979
No, it's a legitimate question, Judith.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.566
Who were you before you came here?

28:55.775 --> 28:57.110
You know who I am, Mark.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.658
Why do you have clonazepam?

29:06.244 --> 29:07.746
You gave a couple to Renee yesterday

29:07.829 --> 29:09.706
and you can't get that
without a prescription.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.542
I have trouble sleeping.

29:13.835 --> 29:18.757
And I have trouble believing that someone
prescribed that to you for insomnia.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.425
Come on, Judith.
It's a potent medication.

29:20.508 --> 29:23.636
You don't pop it like aspirin.
So what's the real story?

29:25.638 --> 29:27.348
Dawn may not know you but I do.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.685
And here's what I know about you.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.188
At least what you've told us.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.816
You lost the love of your life.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.487
He left you.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.698
And you... you fell apart.

29:43.782 --> 29:47.368
You had a nervous breakdown, didn't you?
But is that all, Judith?

29:49.788 --> 29:50.955
Is that all?

29:53.124 --> 29:54.876
Did you try and kill yourself?

29:56.503 --> 29:58.004
I know you cut yourself.

29:58.087 --> 29:59.756
- You think it's a secret but we know.
- Shut up!

29:59.839 --> 30:02.967
You are just one crisis away
from negating your entire existence.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.469
- Mark.
- Did their arrival--

30:04.552 --> 30:08.973
Did it finally push you over the edge?
Kill them, kill yourself, kill them all?

30:11.226 --> 30:16.439
I am a much stronger woman now
than I was before I got here,

30:17.690 --> 30:19.859
and you are trying
to use my past against me.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.111
You're gaslighting me, Mark.

30:22.195 --> 30:26.866
This is all your unconscious shit
you're putting on me and I won't take it!

30:26.950 --> 30:29.702
I won't take your shit!

30:44.467 --> 30:45.760
Renee.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.889
These woods are like your backyard,
aren't they?

30:53.017 --> 30:56.354
And the chainsaw, and the auger,
you're very familiar with those.

30:57.647 --> 30:59.357
So are half the people in this house.

31:03.111 --> 31:04.529
Why would I kill Antoine?

31:08.199 --> 31:09.200
For the money.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.538
What money?

31:15.290 --> 31:16.416
Well, as your legal husband,

31:16.499 --> 31:19.961
Antoine was entitled
to half of the profits from the land sale,

31:20.044 --> 31:23.172
even if your marriage
was never consummated.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.674
You don't know shit about us!

31:26.134 --> 31:29.178
Okay, our marriage may not have been
conventional but we loved each other!

31:31.639 --> 31:33.349
I would have died for him.

31:37.270 --> 31:39.731
And you killed for him.
Let's not forget that.

32:06.424 --> 32:07.425
"Dear J...

32:09.427 --> 32:11.721
I lost my temper with you earlier today.

32:12.972 --> 32:19.520
My only excuse is that I'm trying so hard
to remain strong and to be brave,

32:19.604 --> 32:22.857
and I'm not allowing myself to feel fear.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.902
So I took it out on you.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.365
Please forgive me.

32:32.784 --> 32:33.785
Your Wren."

32:47.757 --> 32:48.841
Is it my turn now?

32:55.390 --> 32:56.516
Tell me about that girl.

32:57.725 --> 32:59.268
The one that you worked with.

33:02.772 --> 33:04.065
That was an accident.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.948
And why did you come back here?
Please don't lie.

33:15.284 --> 33:18.871
To-- to find her body and remove it...

33:20.331 --> 33:22.625
before they start building that resort.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.252
And whose idea was that?

33:29.132 --> 33:30.133
It was mine.

33:34.345 --> 33:40.018
Talvinder was not this sweet
innocent little victim, okay?

33:40.101 --> 33:43.146
She was cruel, and manipulative,
and she didn't care who she hurt.

33:43.229 --> 33:46.399
- So she deserved to die?
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

33:46.482 --> 33:47.483
Well, that's what I'm hearing.

33:47.567 --> 33:50.695
You killed her and you hid
her body God knows where.

33:50.778 --> 33:52.113
You're not hearing.
It was an accident.

33:52.196 --> 33:54.407
- Oh, yes, it was an accident.
- Yes.

33:54.490 --> 33:57.160
That you've been covering up
for five years.

33:58.161 --> 34:01.748
What is this? What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

34:01.831 --> 34:05.460
You say that Talvinder
was cruel and manipulative.

34:05.543 --> 34:08.004
- She was.
- Was she so cruel and so manipulative

34:08.087 --> 34:10.923
that she forced you
to throw her off a cliff,

34:11.007 --> 34:13.176
or drown her in a lake,
or shoot her through the head

34:13.259 --> 34:14.677
- with an arrow by accident?!
- Fuck you!

34:14.761 --> 34:16.721
- Fuck off, Mark!
- How do I know?!

34:16.804 --> 34:18.973
How do I know that it wasn't you

34:19.057 --> 34:22.351
who killed your friends
and my friends to cover this up?

34:22.435 --> 34:25.813
Who invited everyone up and sabotaged
your car, and brought a gun?!

34:28.608 --> 34:29.609
How do I know?

34:40.620 --> 34:42.288
Peter, it's your turn.

34:42.371 --> 34:44.290
No, no, no. Fuck this, okay?

34:44.373 --> 34:48.336
All you've done
is get everyone more upset.

34:48.419 --> 34:51.172
- And you've gotten nowhere.
- [Judith] He's right, Mark.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.133
You're destroying what little we have left
of this community, acting this way.

34:54.217 --> 34:58.554
Someone in this room is killing us.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.140
They're hunting us down one by one!

35:03.309 --> 35:07.105
This is on you. You and Antoine.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.107
Excuse me?

35:09.190 --> 35:10.983
I came here to find peace and I found it.

35:11.067 --> 35:15.154
I did, but then you let them in
and everything, everything's unraveled.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.448
People are being murdered.

35:17.532 --> 35:21.369
Girls are buried in caves
and this community is turning on itself,

35:21.452 --> 35:23.037
and that's on you.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.205
Judith.

35:25.081 --> 35:26.499
Yeah, we're done.

35:26.582 --> 35:28.459
- Are you afraid of questions, Peter?
- Whatever, man.

35:28.543 --> 35:29.585
[Dawn] Mark.

35:31.087 --> 35:33.548
We're done when I say we're done.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.341
- Why don't you put the gun down?
- [Dawn] Mark.

35:35.424 --> 35:39.011
When I have decided who the killer is!

35:39.095 --> 35:40.429
Mark.

35:40.513 --> 35:42.557
- Give me the gun.
- When I decide!

35:44.016 --> 35:48.729
Now you, get in that room
and you answer my fucking questions!

35:48.813 --> 35:50.064
[grunting, gurgling]

35:58.406 --> 36:00.741
Mark, he's choking to death. Please!

36:00.825 --> 36:02.535
[Noah wheezing, labored breathing]

36:04.787 --> 36:05.955
Our friend is dying.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.000
So either you shoot me...

36:10.001 --> 36:12.044
or get that gun out of my face.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.308
[Keira panting]

36:25.391 --> 36:27.977
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.729
Stay, stay, stay. Come on.

36:37.945 --> 36:39.697
[sobbing]

36:54.337 --> 36:55.588
[sobs]

36:58.549 --> 36:59.550
I'm sorry.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.387
[sobbing]

37:25.785 --> 37:27.286
[door opens]

37:32.708 --> 37:33.709
Gun.

37:35.711 --> 37:37.129
- Dawn.
- Gun.

37:38.464 --> 37:40.591
Dawn, that wasn't me in there.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.552
No? What was it, then, your evil twin?

37:45.805 --> 37:47.890
That's fair enough. It was me.

37:48.975 --> 37:51.352
It was, is me, a part of me...

37:52.812 --> 37:55.314
that I've been trying to deny for years.

37:58.192 --> 38:00.945
A part of me that I thought
was gone for good.

38:06.867 --> 38:08.828
I thought I'd found peace here, you know.

38:10.663 --> 38:12.206
I thought I knew who I was.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.502
I thought I could trust my own goodness.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.799
That was all just a lie.

38:21.882 --> 38:23.384
I don't know what you're talking about.

38:27.096 --> 38:29.557
I used to be a guy who handled things,
you know.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.310
I wasn't afraid of anything.

38:33.728 --> 38:34.729
Nothing scared me.

38:38.566 --> 38:39.567
Until one day...

38:40.860 --> 38:44.905
when I got shot
because of something that I'd done...

38:46.782 --> 38:48.701
along with a woman that I cared about.

38:50.661 --> 38:52.371
You see, there's another lie.

38:55.708 --> 38:56.792
I didn't care about her.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.588
I was just using her. Fucking her.

39:03.924 --> 39:05.009
We were at a restaurant.

39:06.093 --> 39:09.472
And he shot her
through the back of the head.

39:10.848 --> 39:15.895
And I had her blood
and bits of brain and her skull...

39:17.063 --> 39:18.064
in my mouth.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.281
She just died like that
right in front of me.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.160
And all I could think was...

39:32.870 --> 39:34.538
thank God that wasn't me.

39:39.668 --> 39:42.463
I would do anything to save myself.

39:42.546 --> 39:47.718
I would lie, I would cheat,
steal, kill, destroy.

39:49.303 --> 39:53.140
I would let an innocent girl die
instead of me.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.520
And I thought I buried that guy out here.

39:59.313 --> 40:02.191
And today he just came
right back out of the grave.

40:09.740 --> 40:10.741
Hey.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.328
That's why I need my gun back.

40:16.205 --> 40:18.374
'Cause I don't know
what that guy is capable of.

40:22.128 --> 40:25.631
Yeah, but we do know what you
and your friends are capable of, don't we?

40:25.714 --> 40:27.383
No.

40:27.466 --> 40:29.176
Until help comes, I keep the gun.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.060
[door opens]

40:38.144 --> 40:38.978
[sighs]

40:39.061 --> 40:42.857
- I suppose you're here for your apology.
- You crossed so many lines.

40:44.775 --> 40:47.153
We'll debrief some other time.
Right now, I need your help.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.905
With what?

40:49.989 --> 40:50.990
Bring the gun.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.496
What the hell are we doing here?

40:57.580 --> 41:00.916
- Renee, answer me!
- I need to check something!

41:01.000 --> 41:02.126
That is not an answer.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.254
- You tell me or I'm heading back.
- It could be nothing.

41:05.337 --> 41:06.589
It probably is nothing.

41:06.672 --> 41:07.715
What?

41:08.674 --> 41:11.760
Someone, and I'm not saying who,

41:11.844 --> 41:13.804
said something they shouldn't have said,
something they shouldn't have known.

41:16.056 --> 41:17.349
About what?

41:17.433 --> 41:18.434
The past.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.145
When this place was a summer camp.

41:23.439 --> 41:26.400
Look, after Glen, I-- I just
needed to be sure, okay?

41:26.484 --> 41:28.402
I just need you to stand guard.

41:51.217 --> 41:53.093
[coughs]

42:09.902 --> 42:11.320
[rustling]

42:31.173 --> 42:32.550
[sighs]

42:48.232 --> 42:51.610
And we're a vegan community,
or we're trying to be.

42:51.694 --> 42:55.364
I'll admit it.
I occasionally fall off the wagon.

42:55.447 --> 42:56.574
Just can't quit a good burger.

42:58.242 --> 43:01.120
And this is Judith, our den mother.
Judith, this is Mark.

43:01.203 --> 43:02.162
Mark Rankin.

43:02.246 --> 43:03.747
Oh.

43:03.831 --> 43:05.541
I'm a hugger.

43:05.624 --> 43:07.042
I hope that's okay.

43:07.835 --> 43:10.879
- That's fine with me.
- Mmm. Welcome, Mark.

43:12.631 --> 43:15.134
Thank you.
Thank you all.

43:17.636 --> 43:19.680
I feel really good being here.

43:19.763 --> 43:21.682
There's something special
about this place, isn't there?

43:23.100 --> 43:24.685
I've been searching for something.

43:26.186 --> 43:28.647
[sighs] A sense of safety and...

43:28.731 --> 43:30.065
I think I've found it.

43:31.984 --> 43:32.985
And that touches me.

43:34.486 --> 43:35.988
This home is for all of us.

43:38.866 --> 43:40.159
It's okay, Mark.

43:41.619 --> 43:44.872
It's okay to let down. Feel it.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.248
We can hold it with you.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.670
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

44:02.181 --> 44:05.267
[motor droning]

44:45.724 --> 44:48.185
[man]  Hey, Andi.
Welcome back to Camp Motega.

44:50.062 --> 44:53.065
Um, stand in front of our photographer
here. We're gonna take a picture.

44:53.148 --> 44:54.274
Mm-hmm.

44:54.358 --> 44:56.777
Uh, let's do one where you smile
for the camera, yeah? Say cheese.

44:56.860 --> 44:58.737
Yeah, sure. Cheese.

44:58.821 --> 44:59.863
[camera shutter clicks]

45:05.160 --> 45:07.287
Okay, we're taking another photo
'cause I look like Jabba the Hutt,

45:07.371 --> 45:08.705
except with more chins.

45:08.789 --> 45:09.790
Okay.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.167
Just one more.

45:14.795 --> 45:17.423
[man] Please stand a bit to your right.
Awesome.

45:19.049 --> 45:20.926
I think it would look better
if you gave us a smile.

45:21.009 --> 45:23.429
Can you give us a big smile, please?

45:23.512 --> 45:24.513
Sure.

45:25.431 --> 45:26.807
[camera beeps, shutter clicks]

45:30.477 --> 45:31.645
[man]  You know the drill, right?

45:31.728 --> 45:34.898
I never take a picture I don't like,
so do what you gotta do.

45:34.982 --> 45:36.692
[camera beeps, shutter clicks]

45:38.902 --> 45:39.736
[man]  Say cheese.

45:40.737 --> 45:41.613
Say cheese.

45:41.697 --> 45:44.032
How's it going? "Gouda." No?

45:44.116 --> 45:45.242
You gotta "brie" kidding me.

45:45.325 --> 45:47.244
[chuckles] That was funny.

45:50.747 --> 45:53.000
[man] Susan, photo time.

45:54.251 --> 45:56.420
- Okay, say cheese.
- Fromage.

45:56.503 --> 45:57.796
[camera beeps, shutter clicks]

46:05.262 --> 46:06.555
Jesus.

46:07.222 --> 46:09.141
[man] Everyone's gotta have
a picture taken, camp rules.

46:09.224 --> 46:10.267
[Wren] Fuck your rules.

46:10.350 --> 46:12.519
[man] You want to spend the summer
working the grounds or not?

46:12.603 --> 46:13.437
[Wren] Yeah.

46:13.520 --> 46:16.565
[man] Then please step in front of
the camera and let us take your picture.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.200
Renee!

46:26.283 --> 46:29.203

- Hey! Hey!

46:29.286 --> 46:32.289
Follow my voice! We need your help!

46:32.372 --> 46:33.707
Hey!

46:36.502 --> 46:37.544
Over here!

46:37.628 --> 46:39.046
Oh, no, no, no.

46:39.129 --> 46:42.174
It's okay. It's okay. We need your...
