00:32.400 --> 00:34.700
"K.N. murders his own best intentions."

04:07.600 --> 04:10.600
Mmm, sorry about that.
Come on in.

04:11.400 --> 04:15.200
I, uh... I rode up on the
elevator with someone.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.800
Someone from next door, I think.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.200
- Young guy?
- Yeah.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.100
New neighbor. Why?

04:21.100 --> 04:22.600
You met him?

04:22.600 --> 04:26.000
- Uh, briefly, yeah. He's a writer.
- What does he write?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.800
He didn't say.

04:27.800 --> 04:34.100
These are, uh... these are my autopsy
reports from the second victim.

04:44.100 --> 04:48.200
As you can see the heart was removed in the
same manner as the previous victim.

04:48.200 --> 04:53.000
No incisions, no scope marks,
no cutting of any kind.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.800
- No indication of how the killer did it?
- No.

04:55.800 --> 05:01.200
There's no prints, no DNA material,
no hair and fiber.

05:02.200 --> 05:06.000
And yet, you still refuse to believe my theory,
that what this is is psychic surgery?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.600
Mulder, psychic surgery is some man dipping
his hand in a bucket of chicken guts...

05:09.600 --> 05:12.700
...and pretending to remove tumors
from the sick and gullible.

05:12.700 --> 05:17.800
Or... it's a grossly misunderstood
area of alternative medicine.

05:17.800 --> 05:22.200
Well, medicine, as you're referring to
it is about keeping people alive.

05:22.200 --> 05:27.800
Well, absent another theory how else do we account
for the impossible extraction of this man's heart?

05:27.800 --> 05:30.000
I don't know. I have no idea.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.900
I mean, we have no evidence, no MO to speak of.
This could be the perfect crime.

05:34.900 --> 05:38.700
Well, a crime is only as perfect as the
man or the mind that commits it.

05:38.700 --> 05:43.100
Even if it were perfect, even if he made not
one mistake, there's still his motive.

05:43.100 --> 05:46.700
You find his motive and you
find the murderer.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.200
That's why I didn't want
to come here, Kevin.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.500
- I'm not even doing anything.
- You're thinking about it.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.100
There's a console between us.
I mean, how much can I do?

06:38.100 --> 06:40.200
You make it sound like
I'm an attacker.

06:40.200 --> 06:45.000
- Well, we talked about this.
- I told you I loved you.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.200
Oh, Kevin...

07:00.900 --> 07:03.000
- There you go again.
- What?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.200
That thing that you do.
You know what I am talking about.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.500
- But that's the way I kiss, Maggie.
- Well, I get the message.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.600
- Where are you going?
- No. I can't talk to you.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.200
Maggie!

07:32.400 --> 07:34.100
Maggie!

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Maggie!

07:42.200 --> 07:44.200
Maggie, come on.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.400
"...beating heart."

08:28.400 --> 08:30.900
- Scully.
- Hey, Scully, glad I caught you.

08:30.900 --> 08:35.400
We got a third victim, 16-year,
old kid out on lover's lane.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.799
Are you sure?

08:38.100 --> 08:43.200
Yeah. I'm sure many a person's had their heart
broken out here, but not quite like this.

08:43.200 --> 08:47.200
I was hoping you'd be here to explain it
in medical terms to the local PD.

08:47.200 --> 08:51.200
I'm not sure that I could.
Did anybody see anybody?

08:51.200 --> 08:54.500
No, nothing. I mean, it's like there's
nowhere to start on this case.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.900
Nothing to ask nothing to say.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.700
Well, there's got to be something, Mulder...

08:59.700 --> 09:04.000
Something about his victims,
why he chooses them, a pattern.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.500
So far, there's absolutely nothing, Scully.
It appears to be just a series of random attacks.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.100
An envelope's been
slipped under your door.

09:12.100 --> 09:15.300
- Yeah? From who?
- It's unmarked.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.600
It's some kind of a pendant.
Like a charm.

09:31.100 --> 09:35.100
Her prompt mind ran through the
golconda of possibilities:

09:35.100 --> 09:37.300
Was this trinket from the killer?

09:37.300 --> 09:40.900
Was there a message contained
in its equivocal symbolism?

09:40.900 --> 09:44.300
Was he a religious fanatic who had,
in fervid haste licked the envelope, ...

09:44.300 --> 09:47.900
...leaving the telltale DNA that
would begin his unraveling?

09:47.900 --> 09:50.900
She had a condign certainty
the killer was a male...

09:50.900 --> 09:55.200
And now, as she held the cold metal at her
fingertips she imagined him doing the same...

09:55.200 --> 09:57.700
...trying to picture his face.

09:57.700 --> 10:03.600
It would be a plain face, an average face...
A face people would be prone to trust.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.000
She knew this inherently, being
naturally trusting herself.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.400
But the image she conjured up was no better than the
useless sketch composites that littered her files.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.300
Preconsciously, she knew this wasn't
her strength as an investigator.

10:16.300 --> 10:22.400
She was a marshall of cold facts,
quick to organize, connect, shuffle, ...

10:22.400 --> 10:27.200
...reorder and synthesize their relative
hard values into discreet categories.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.600
Imprecision would only invite
sexist criticism...

10:30.600 --> 10:36.500
...that she was soft, malleable not
up to her male counterparts.

10:38.100 --> 10:43.200
Even now, as she pushed an errant strand
of titian hair behind her ear...

10:43.200 --> 10:47.500
...she worried her partner would know
instinctively what she could only guess.

10:47.500 --> 10:52.800
To be thought of as simply a beautiful
woman was bridling, unthinkable.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.000
But she was beautiful...

10:55.000 --> 10:59.400
...fatally, stunningly prepossessing.

10:59.400 --> 11:04.200
Yet the compensatory respect she commanded
only deepened the yearnings of her heart...

11:04.200 --> 11:09.100
...to let it open, to let someone in.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.900
It's called a "milagro".

11:17.900 --> 11:21.900
That's the Spanish word for "miracle".
It's worn as a lucky charm.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.200
It came here for me?

11:23.200 --> 11:26.700
It was dropped off at reception by
a man in his late 20s, early 30s...

11:26.700 --> 11:29.900
...average looking, average build.
They weren't able to get a good ID.

11:29.900 --> 11:34.800
There are no fingerprints and
no DNA from his saliva.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.600
I don't think it's the killer, Scully.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.900
- Did you see that it's a burning heart?
- I see it has a burning heart.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.400
But we're dealing with a killer that
leaves absolutely no clues.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.300
Why would he do something
as heavy-handed as this?

11:45.300 --> 11:49.600
Well, maybe it has something to do with his
next victim. Maybe he's taunting you.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.700
Maybe it's not me at all.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.900
Maybe he sent it to you.

11:54.100 --> 11:57.100
Maybe it's a secret admirer.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.500
I think I'll check it out.

11:59.500 --> 12:06.800
Actually, let me. You've got a 9:00 a.m. with the DC medical
examiner. He's going to let you autopsy the latest victim.

12:07.300 --> 12:12.900
Thank you for making my schedule but I think I'm
going to have to be late for that appointment.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.300
I often come here to look
at this painting.

12:59.300 --> 13:03.900
It's called "My Divine Heart" after the
miracle of Saint Margaret Mary.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.700
Do you know the story...

13:06.700 --> 13:09.500
The revelation of the Sacred Heart?

13:09.500 --> 13:12.100
Christ came to Margaret Mary...

13:12.100 --> 13:19.100
...his heart so inflamed with love that it was no
longer able to contain its burning flames of charity.

13:19.100 --> 13:27.000
Margaret Mary... so filled with divine love herself,
asked the Lord to take her heart...

13:27.000 --> 13:34.800
...and so he did placing it alongside his until
it burned with the flames of his passion.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.500
Then he restored it to Margaret Mary...

13:38.500 --> 13:42.500
...sealing her wound with the
touch of his blessed hand.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.700
Why are you telling me this?

13:45.700 --> 13:48.600
You came here specifically to see
this painting, didn't you?

13:48.600 --> 13:50.500
Yes.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.900
How did you know that?

13:51.900 --> 13:55.300
I saw you enter. The way you
knew right where it was.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.600
I know you.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.400
You live next to somebody
I work with.

14:02.100 --> 14:06.200
- Why are you following me?
- I'm not.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.400
I'd only imagined that you'd
come here today.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.900
- You imagined it.
- Yes.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.300
Yeah.

14:13.300 --> 14:19.100
I'm a writer. That's what I do:
imagine how people behave.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.100
I have to admit I've noticed you.

14:21.100 --> 14:25.500
I do that... Notice people.

14:26.700 --> 14:31.100
I saw that you wear a gold cross around your neck so
I was taking a chance with the painting, ...

14:31.100 --> 14:34.200
...explaining something you may
have already known.

14:34.200 --> 14:38.200
I saw Georgetown parking permits on
your car dating from 1993...

14:38.200 --> 14:41.700
...and a government-exempt sticker that
lets you park anywhere you like.

14:41.700 --> 14:46.500
You don't live in this area but as a federal
employee, you have reason to frequent it.

14:47.200 --> 14:52.400
You're fit, with muscular calves
so you must exercise or run.

14:52.400 --> 14:56.900
There's a popular running route right nearby
that you might use at lunch or after work.

14:56.900 --> 14:59.600
You'd have noticed this
church in passing...

14:59.600 --> 15:02.500
...and though parking is always a
problem in this part of town...

15:02.500 --> 15:05.700
...your special privileges would
make it easy to visit...

15:05.700 --> 15:12.200
...not as a place of worship but because you have
an appreciation for architecture and the arts...

15:12.200 --> 15:16.400
...and while the grandeur is what you'd
take away from your visit...

15:16.400 --> 15:20.900
...this painting's religious symbolism would
have left a subconscious impression...

15:20.900 --> 15:25.000
...jogged by the gift you received
this morning.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.800
That was from you?

15:26.800 --> 15:30.600
I have to admit to a secret attraction.

15:30.800 --> 15:35.000
I'm sorry I didn't include a note explaining
that but you didn't know me then.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.800
Yeah, and I don't know you now
and I don't care to.

15:38.800 --> 15:44.100
I see this is making you
uncomfortable and I'm sorry.

15:44.100 --> 15:47.300
It's just that I'm taken with you.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.900
That never happens to me.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.800
We're alike that way.

16:18.100 --> 16:22.900
Hey, you weren't joking about being late.
I was about to start slicing and dicing, myself.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.700
I'm sorry.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.200
Where were you?

16:26.200 --> 16:30.600
I was doing some research and learning
that I owe you an apology.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.100
For what?

16:32.100 --> 16:37.700
The Milagro charm. You were
right about its insignificance.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.400
No, I think I was wrong.

16:39.400 --> 16:43.300
I think it's very significant.
I think it may be a communication from the killer.

16:43.300 --> 16:47.200
Most of my research shows that most credible
practitioners of psychic surgery...

16:47.200 --> 16:52.600
...believe themselves to be imbued with the Holy Spirit,
that their hands become the miracle tools of God.

16:52.600 --> 16:57.100
Mulder, this... is nothing
more than a tool...

16:57.100 --> 17:01.300
...used by a lovelorn Romeo who just
happens to be your next-door neighbor.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.700
Who, the writer?

17:02.700 --> 17:09.400
Yes, my secret admirer who claims to know
the mysteries of my heart.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.500
- You're kidding.
- No, I wish I were.

17:11.500 --> 17:15.599
He cornered me today and
told me my life story.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.700
It was kind of frightening, actually.

17:18.900 --> 17:21.099
Is... he our killer?

17:21.099 --> 17:22.900
No.

17:22.900 --> 17:27.599
"Frightening" as in too much
information and intimate detail.

17:27.599 --> 17:31.500
What kills you is his audacity.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.900
Did you get his name?

17:34.900 --> 17:39.400
No, but that shouldn't be too
hard to find out, should it?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.900
I'm sorry I forgot your name.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.600
- Padgett.
- Padgett.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.400
Phillip Padgett.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.700
You're a writer.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.400
Anything I'd know?

19:01.400 --> 19:03.700
I don't think so.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.100
You're an FBI agent.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.900
Working on anything interesting?

19:24.800 --> 19:26.900
A murder case.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.800
Anything I'd know?

19:30.400 --> 19:32.500
Possibly.

19:36.100 --> 19:42.700
The overture in the church had urged the beautiful agent's
partner into an act of Hegelian self-justification.

19:42.700 --> 19:46.100
Expeditiously violating the fourth
amendment against mail theft, ...

19:46.100 --> 19:49.800
...he prepared to impudently
infract the first.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.400
But if she'd predictably aroused
her sly partner's suspicions...

19:58.400 --> 20:04.400
...Special Agent Dana Scully had
herself become... simply aroused.

20:05.400 --> 20:10.600
All morning the stranger's unsolicited compliments had
played on the dampened strings of her instrument...

20:10.600 --> 20:15.100
...until the middle "C" of consciousness
was struck square and resonant.

20:15.100 --> 20:17.200
She was flattered.

20:17.200 --> 20:21.200
His words had presented her a
pretty picture of herself...

20:21.200 --> 20:24.700
...quite unlike the practiced mask of
uprightness that mirrored back to her...

20:24.700 --> 20:31.500
...from the medical examiners and the investigators
and all the lawmen who dared no such utterances.

20:31.500 --> 20:38.500
She felt an involuntary flush and rebuked
herself for the girlish indulgence.

20:38.500 --> 20:42.500
But the images came perforce
and she let them play, ...

20:42.500 --> 20:46.100
...let them flood in like savory,
or more a sugary confection...

20:46.100 --> 20:53.000
...from her adolescence when her senses were
new and ungoverned by fear and self-denial.

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
'Ache', 'pang',
'prick', 'twinge'.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.300
How ironic the Victorian vocabulary
of behavioral pathology...

21:02.300 --> 21:06.600
...now so perfectly described the
palpations of her own desire.

21:06.600 --> 21:12.200
The stranger had looked her in the eye and knew
her more completely than she knew herself.

21:12.200 --> 21:17.900
She felt wild, feral,
guilty as a criminal.

21:17.900 --> 21:21.900
Had the stranger unleashed in
her what was already there...

21:21.900 --> 21:27.800
...or only helped her discover a landscape she,
by necessity, blinded herself to?

21:28.300 --> 21:31.800
What would her partner
think of her?

21:50.300 --> 21:53.100
Mr. Popularity.

22:36.900 --> 22:42.400
"...compulsion was overwhelming..."

22:50.700 --> 22:53.100
Hi. I, um...

22:53.100 --> 22:56.400
I was going next door and I
thought that I'd return this.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.300
Why?

22:59.000 --> 23:02.500
Because I can't return the gesture.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.200
I can't.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.700
You're curious about me.

23:19.900 --> 23:22.200
You don't have any furniture.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.400
I have what I need.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.700
I write at my desk.
I sleep in my bed.

23:27.700 --> 23:29.200
You don't eat?

23:29.200 --> 23:31.900
I live in my head.

23:32.900 --> 23:35.900
- Writing your books?
- Yes.

23:36.300 --> 23:38.100
Anything I'd know?

23:38.100 --> 23:39.400
No.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.900
They're all failures...

23:41.900 --> 23:44.900
Except the one I'm working on now.

23:45.100 --> 23:47.500
I think I'm getting it right.

23:47.500 --> 23:52.100
- Why now, all of a sudden?
- Best not to question it.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.300
See?

23:56.300 --> 24:00.200
- You are curious about me.
- Well, you lead a curious life.

24:00.200 --> 24:04.000
It's not so different
from yours I imagine.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Lonely.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.600
Loneliness is a choice.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.300
So, how about a cup of coffee?

24:19.100 --> 24:21.300
"To Maggie with love"
On Valentines Day
2/14/99 - Kevin.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.700
"How will it end?"

24:55.800 --> 24:59.500
My life's not so lonely,
Mister, um...

24:59.500 --> 25:01.500
Padgett.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.800
It's actually anything but.

25:05.100 --> 25:07.900
How is it you think you know me
so well, Mr. Padgett?

25:07.900 --> 25:10.200
I'm writing about you.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.100
Right.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.900
- Since when?
- Since I first noticed you.

25:18.900 --> 25:21.900
You live in my old neighborhood.

25:22.900 --> 25:26.700
And you moved into this
building by coincidence?

25:26.700 --> 25:28.300
No.

25:28.300 --> 25:32.800
- You moved here because of me?
- There wasn't anything available in your building...

25:32.800 --> 25:36.500
...and it's not like you spent
a lot of time at home.

25:36.500 --> 25:40.500
I-I should've said something but I just
couldn't get it all down fast enough.

25:40.500 --> 25:44.300
To really write someone,
I have to be in their head.

25:44.300 --> 25:47.500
I have to know them more completely
than they know themselves.

25:47.500 --> 25:52.000
- This is all about me?
- Well, you're an important part.

25:53.300 --> 25:56.500
- May I read it?
- It's not finished.

25:56.500 --> 26:01.400
I can't tell you how helpful it is having you here,
being able to talk with you like this.

26:01.400 --> 26:04.000
Would you sit and stay a minute?

26:04.900 --> 26:07.800
You don't have anywhere to sit.

26:18.200 --> 26:22.400
- I'm due next door.
- You haven't finished your coffee.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
I'm very uncomfortable with this.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.900
Why?

26:29.900 --> 26:32.500
You're armed, aren't you?

26:35.300 --> 26:37.700
Imagine that.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.200
I'll get a bulb.

27:00.800 --> 27:04.400
A view only a writer can appreciate.

27:11.900 --> 27:17.000
If you know me so well then why am I standing
here when my instincts tell me to go?

27:17.000 --> 27:20.100
Motive is never easy.

27:21.500 --> 27:25.500
Sometimes it occurs to
one only later.

27:28.100 --> 27:29.600
Please.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.600
Sit.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.500
Imagine that.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.000
Mulder!

28:22.000 --> 28:24.800
- Scully.
- What are you doing?

28:25.200 --> 28:26.900
You all right?

28:27.200 --> 28:28.600
Yes.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.200
Mulder...

28:40.300 --> 28:42.600
What are you doing?

28:45.500 --> 28:48.500
Putting this man under arrest.

28:52.800 --> 28:56.900
"...his fantasy come to life..."
"...and felt his warm, beating heart."

29:07.100 --> 29:09.800
Yes, I've seen this paper.

29:09.800 --> 29:15.000
Yeah, it's how you found your victims,
in the personals. They all took out personal ads.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.700
- They were lovers.
- And you targeted them.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.300
I only write about them.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.900
- No, you targeted...
- Mulder...

29:22.400 --> 29:26.500
- Not without his lawyer.
- I don't need a lawyer. I'm telling the truth.

29:26.500 --> 29:29.000
Then this is your confession?

29:35.300 --> 29:37.500
No, that's my novel.

29:37.500 --> 29:42.400
It's all in there, every detail,
every murder, all laid out.

29:42.800 --> 29:46.500
- How'd you do it, Mr. Padgett?
- If I sit long enough, it just comes to me.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.700
The murders.

29:47.700 --> 29:52.000
I only knew what was in my mind
and wished to express it clearly.

29:52.900 --> 29:55.800
How about "the stranger"?
Is that you?

29:56.600 --> 30:00.900
- How about Ken Naciamento?
- The self-proclaimed Brazilian psychic surgeon?

30:00.900 --> 30:04.400
- Is that your accomplice?
- I guess you could say that. He's a central character.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.000
Did you direct him to do it?

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
Jungians would say it's the characters who
choose the writer, not the other way around.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.600
So I guess you could argue
he directed me.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.000
Which is the truth?

30:18.000 --> 30:21.300
By their nature words are imprecise
and layered with meaning.

30:21.300 --> 30:27.900
The signs of things, not the things themselves.
It's difficult to say who's in charge.

30:30.300 --> 30:32.500
Mulder.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.500
Why, Mr. Padgett?

30:40.500 --> 30:43.600
Maybe that's a question you can answer.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.300
That's the one question I can't.

30:51.500 --> 30:56.600
Agent Mulder, my book... did you like it?

30:56.900 --> 30:59.900
Maybe if it were fiction.

31:04.500 --> 31:08.100
- Mulder, where are you going?
- To find his accomplice, the Brazilian psychic surgeon.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.100
I did that.

31:10.100 --> 31:12.500
That's what I've been doing.

31:12.800 --> 31:18.100
Dr. Ken Naciamento, Sao Paulo, Brazil,
emigrated here in 1996.

31:18.100 --> 31:20.100
- Where is he now?
- He's dead.

31:20.100 --> 31:22.300
- He can't be.
- Two years dead, Mulder.

31:22.300 --> 31:24.500
I'm having them fax me a
certificate of death.

31:24.500 --> 31:28.900
- Padgett couldn't have done this alone.
- Well, maybe he didn't do it at all.

31:28.900 --> 31:31.600
Scully, it's all on the page.
How else would he know it?

31:31.600 --> 31:38.200
Maybe he imagined it, like he said.
Like Shakespeare or Freud or-or Jung.

31:38.200 --> 31:43.300
I mean, maybe, maybe he has some gift and he
has a clear window into human nature.

31:43.300 --> 31:47.100
No one can predict human behavior. No one
can tell you what another person's going to do.

31:47.100 --> 31:49.600
Well, isn't that what you do, Mulder,
as a behavioral profiler?

31:49.600 --> 31:53.900
You... you imagine the killer's mind so well
that you know what they're going to do next.

31:53.900 --> 32:00.800
If he imagines it, it's a priori, before the fact.
I think that's pretty clear from what he wrote about you.

32:01.400 --> 32:05.800
- You know you're in here, don't you?
- I read a chapter.

32:08.100 --> 32:10.300
What does he say?

32:11.200 --> 32:14.500
Well, let's just say it ends with you doing
the naked pretzel with "the stranger"...

32:14.500 --> 32:18.600
...on a bed in an unfurnished
fourth floor apartment.

32:21.900 --> 32:24.600
I'm assuming that's a priori, too?

32:24.600 --> 32:28.400
I think you know me better
than that, Mulder.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.100
Well, you might want to finish it.

32:54.600 --> 32:58.200
Prisoner's written something
I think you should see.

32:59.100 --> 33:02.000
- What is it?
- He says it's a statement.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.800
I think he's putting somebody on.

33:09.800 --> 33:15.700
Grief squeezed at her eggshell heart like
it might break into a thousand pieces...

33:15.700 --> 33:18.900
...its contents running like
broken promises...

33:18.900 --> 33:22.800
...into the hollow places
his love used to fill.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.300
How could she know this
pain would end?

33:25.300 --> 33:31.200
That love, unlike matter or energy,
was in endless supply in the universe...

33:31.200 --> 33:33.900
A germ which grows from nothingness...

33:33.900 --> 33:38.700
...which cannot be eradicated even
from the darkest of hearts.

33:38.700 --> 33:42.900
If she had known this, and who could
say she would believe it?

33:42.900 --> 33:47.200
She would not have chanced to remain at
his sad grave until such an hour...

33:47.200 --> 33:51.500
...so that she might not have to learn the
second truth before the first:

33:51.500 --> 33:58.300
That to have love was to carry a vessel
that could be lost or stolen or worse, ...

33:58.300 --> 34:01.300
...spilled blood-red on the ground.

34:01.300 --> 34:05.600
And that love was not immutable
and could become hate...

34:05.600 --> 34:08.199
...as day becomes night...

34:08.199 --> 34:10.600
...as life becomes death.

34:51.600 --> 34:55.400
She's a no-show at home or
anywhere else she might go.

34:55.699 --> 34:58.700
No signs of a possible struggle at the
grave site but the area's been so...

34:58.700 --> 35:02.700
...trammeled by the funeral that collecting
evidence is going to be virtually impossible.

35:02.700 --> 35:05.000
I think this is a big jerk off.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
Maybe his statement's to prove
that he's telling the truth.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.100
That he truly just
imagined it, Mulder.

35:10.100 --> 35:14.000
The only thing that he
imagined was us out here...

35:16.200 --> 35:18.500
...looking like idiots.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.400
Hands where I can see 'em!
Don't move until I tell you!

35:28.400 --> 35:30.800
I'm a federal agent.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.700
- Mulder, that's not him.
- What? What'd I do?

35:33.700 --> 35:36.500
- Mulder.
- The truck. Check the truck, Scully.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.200
Mulder, he works here.

36:14.800 --> 36:18.200
How did you know, Mulder,
that the body was in the truck?

36:18.200 --> 36:20.300
I imagined it.

36:20.300 --> 36:23.200
It's still no evidence that
Padgett directed the killer.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.900
What do you need, a signed work order?
Of course he directed him.

36:25.900 --> 36:29.800
Mulder, you are making critical
assumptions without any facts.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.000
What about time of death? What...?

36:32.400 --> 36:36.300
- What are you doing?
- You're about to argue my usual side, aren't you?

36:36.300 --> 36:39.900
Mulder, why couldn't he have imagined it?
Why couldn't he just be in the killer's head?

36:39.900 --> 36:42.300
You read his book. You read
what he wrote about you.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.200
Are you trying to tell me that he got inside
your head? That what I read is true?

36:45.200 --> 36:48.800
- Mulder, of course not.
- I don't know how they communicate.

36:48.800 --> 36:52.100
This is the only way
I can think to catch him.

36:55.400 --> 36:58.000
Mr. Padgett...

36:59.000 --> 37:00.900
You can go.

37:00.900 --> 37:05.400
We apologize for our mistake.
You're free to finish your book.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.600
Thank you.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.900
I made a mistake myself.

37:15.900 --> 37:19.300
What's that, Mr. Padgett?

37:19.700 --> 37:25.700
In my book, I'd written that Agent Scully
falls in love but that's obviously impossible.

37:25.700 --> 37:28.800
Agent Scully is already in love.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.100
What are you doing here?

38:21.400 --> 38:24.200
You seem surprised to see me.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.200
Yes. Completely.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.000
Why?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.100
I'm your character.

38:30.100 --> 38:34.400
- What do you want?
- I'm here to help you finish.

38:34.400 --> 38:37.000
I-I can't figure out your motive.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.900
You imagine me so perfectly
in every way.

38:39.900 --> 38:43.200
So perfectly that you
bring me to life.

38:43.200 --> 38:48.200
- Why did you choose me?
- I needed a perfect crime.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.900
And she's a doctor.
She'd be horrified by what you do.

38:51.900 --> 38:54.900
I'm horrified.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.600
I just want to know why I do it.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.700
So I could meet her.

39:03.200 --> 39:06.200
That's not a reason.

39:10.200 --> 39:13.800
It's an excuse.

39:18.900 --> 39:22.000
- Anything?
- No. He's just sitting there.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.700
Staring.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.100
- Now what is this?
- A big mistake.

39:33.100 --> 39:36.700
I misjudged her character--
her interest in me.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.100
Now we're on to something.

39:39.100 --> 39:42.600
She's only trying to get his
attention but doesn't know it.

39:42.600 --> 39:47.800
- The old unconscious at work.
- I wanted to love her.

39:48.100 --> 39:52.100
No wonder you can't finish
this book, Padgett.

39:52.100 --> 39:56.400
- Why do I want their hearts?
- You tell me. Why do you do it?

39:56.400 --> 39:59.900
I'm your character.
You tell me.

39:59.900 --> 40:04.500
- My reason is your reason.
- I want to feel love.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.900
No.

40:06.300 --> 40:07.500
No.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.800
You had it right up to there.

40:09.800 --> 40:13.200
You were a tool of the truth.

40:13.200 --> 40:18.000
And when it finally arrives,
when I arrive, ...

40:18.000 --> 40:22.400
- ...you don't want to see it.
- But what is the truth?

40:22.400 --> 40:27.000
Man imagines that he, too,
can open up his heart...

40:27.000 --> 40:32.300
...and expose the burning passion,
the flames of charity, ...

40:32.300 --> 40:38.400
...like the creator himself but
this is not in his power.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.800
But I have love in my heart.

40:40.800 --> 40:45.200
Yes, as a thief has riches,
a usurer money.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.700
You have it...

40:47.700 --> 40:53.400
But man's only power, only true power...

40:53.400 --> 40:55.200
...is to destroy it.

40:55.200 --> 40:59.600
Then what's the end of my story?

41:00.500 --> 41:04.700
There can only be one true ending...

41:04.700 --> 41:07.900
...if it is to be perfect.

41:09.700 --> 41:12.200
She dies?

41:12.800 --> 41:14.900
See?

41:14.900 --> 41:18.000
It almost writes itself.

41:36.800 --> 41:39.500
What's he up to now?

41:40.100 --> 41:43.100
He just started typing again.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.200
Now what?

41:59.300 --> 42:01.200
Anything?

42:18.400 --> 42:20.000
Padgett!

42:20.000 --> 42:21.700
Freeze.

42:22.500 --> 42:25.300
Step away from the incinerator.

42:37.700 --> 42:41.300
- What do you think you're doing?
- Destroying my book.

42:41.300 --> 42:43.900
Destroying evidence, you mean.

42:44.100 --> 42:47.200
- Let me see what you wrote.
- I'll tell you.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.000
He kills her.

42:59.800 --> 43:02.900
You came down here to give these
instructions to your accomplice?

43:02.900 --> 43:05.400
- No, he told me how it ends.
- When?

43:05.400 --> 43:08.600
- In my apartment.
- You were alone up there.

44:14.700 --> 44:18.100
A story can have only one true ending.

44:18.100 --> 44:21.200
Even as the stranger felt compelled to
commit his final words to paper...

44:21.200 --> 44:24.100
...he did it knowing they
must never be read.

44:24.100 --> 44:30.500
To see the sum of his work was to see inside his own
emptiness the heart of a destroyer not a creator.

44:30.500 --> 44:35.000
And yet, reflected back upon him at
