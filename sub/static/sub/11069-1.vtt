38:22.122 --> 38:24.624
And tell Willie to break out the big boy.

38:26.210 --> 38:28.544
Copy that. Willie...

38:28.712 --> 38:29.962
Yeah. Go, Ellie.

38:30.130 --> 38:33.424
I can hear can it on the headphones.
We gotta be sure about this.

38:33.592 --> 38:36.302
Give me another array status.

38:37.721 --> 38:40.640
Her four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

38:40.808 --> 38:43.559
FISHER: Your four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

38:43.727 --> 38:46.104
But there's a bad drive on 16.

38:46.313 --> 38:48.815
Your four are online,
the rest are tracking in...

38:48.982 --> 38:51.818
...but there's a bad drive on 16.
Copy that?

38:53.070 --> 38:55.363
What do you want me to do
about the source queue?

38:55.531 --> 38:57.615
Look, forget about it and hold the queue.

38:57.783 --> 39:01.952
Go get ready to set the target frequency
to manual the second we're aligned.

39:02.161 --> 39:06.498
Do you copy? I want you to go
off-axis on 27 the second we're there.

39:06.749 --> 39:09.584
And leave the LO frequency where it is.

39:09.752 --> 39:13.046
Stay on it, Fish, don't let it get away.
If you lose it, scan the band.

39:13.214 --> 39:16.508
Run every frequency you can think of.

39:21.097 --> 39:22.806
How you doing?

39:27.019 --> 39:28.145
Talk to me, guys.

39:28.354 --> 39:32.190
Partially polarized set of moving pulses,
amplitude modulated.

39:32.358 --> 39:36.027
We're locked. Systems check out, signal
across the board. What's the frequency?

39:36.195 --> 39:39.239
4.46, 23 gigahertz.

39:40.616 --> 39:43.869
Hydrogen times pi. Told you.

39:44.036 --> 39:45.829

39:55.756 --> 39:57.215
Listen to that.

39:59.469 --> 40:01.720
Make me a liar, Fish.

40:01.888 --> 40:04.556
It could be AWACS out of Kirtland
jamming us.

40:04.724 --> 40:06.099
But I'm doubting it.

40:06.267 --> 40:08.894
All right, let's see
if F.U.D.D.'s reading it too.

40:09.729 --> 40:13.064
Willie, patch it back
and give me the off-axis.

40:13.232 --> 40:14.900
- Are we recording?
- Never stopped.

40:16.986 --> 40:18.278
Thank you, Elmer.

40:18.488 --> 40:20.405
AWACS status is negative.

40:20.573 --> 40:23.407
- White Sands?
- On this frequency? No.

40:23.575 --> 40:25.075
I'm gonna punch up the darks.

40:28.246 --> 40:31.916
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Come on.

40:34.252 --> 40:36.754
FISHER: NORAD's not tracking
any snoops in this vector.

40:36.922 --> 40:38.506
Shuttle Endeavor is in sleep mode.

40:38.673 --> 40:41.175
Okay, point source confirmed.

40:41.343 --> 40:43.928
- Whatever it is, it ain't local.
- Position?

40:44.095 --> 40:46.764
WILLIE: I checked interferometry.
Somewhere in Lyra, I think.

40:46.932 --> 40:48.432
- Vega?
FISHER: Can't be.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.851
It's only 26 light years away.

40:51.019 --> 40:53.979
- What's the peak intensity?
FISHER: Coming up.

40:54.147 --> 40:55.397
ELLIE:
Vega.

40:55.565 --> 40:59.527
Vega. I scanned it a bunch of times at
Arecibo. It was negative results, always.

40:59.736 --> 41:03.113
Got it. Reading over 100 janskys.

41:03.281 --> 41:05.658

Wait a minute. Those are numbers.

That was a three,
the one before it was a two.

41:54.248 --> 41:57.667

see how far can we get.

41:57.835 --> 41:59.460

42:05.009 --> 42:06.092
WILLIE: Seven.
ELLIE: Seven.

42:08.929 --> 42:10.513
Those are primes.

42:10.681 --> 42:13.266
Two, three, five, seven,
those are all prime numbers.

42:13.434 --> 42:15.393
There's no way
that's a natural phenomenon.

42:15.561 --> 42:16.686
- Holy shit.
- Okay, okay.

42:16.854 --> 42:20.189
Let's just calm down
and pull up the star file on Vega.

42:20.733 --> 42:23.693
FISHER: It doesn't make any sense.
The system is too young...

42:23.861 --> 42:25.862
...so it can't have a planetary system...

42:26.030 --> 42:29.449
...let alone life
or a technological civilization.

42:29.617 --> 42:32.201
Maybe they didn't grow up there.
Maybe they're visiting.

42:32.369 --> 42:35.705
Spacecraft? This system is
full of debris. It would get clobbered.

42:35.873 --> 42:40.043
Well, not if they used their laser blasters
and photon torpedoes.

42:40.210 --> 42:43.630
- That's not funny.
- How else are we gonna explain it?

42:43.797 --> 42:47.008
Willie's right. If we go public with this
and we're wrong, that's it.

42:47.176 --> 42:49.677
It's over. We're cooked.

42:50.679 --> 42:53.264
God, I wish Kent was here.

42:53.432 --> 42:57.518
Whatever the signal is, we better
do something soon. Vega's gonna set.

All right, do you have
a source location yet?

43:12.909 --> 43:15.827
We put it right smack in the middle.

43:15.995 --> 43:17.579

43:19.415 --> 43:22.417
Okay, thanks, lan. Keep tracking
and we'll get back to you.

43:22.585 --> 43:24.252

This morning's detection of an unidentified
radio source from deep space...

44:03.501 --> 44:06.128
...can neither be confirmed nor denied.

...living outside of our solar system.
Again, there is no confirmation...

44:18.099 --> 44:22.018
...that the official IAU communiqué
was sent from this government facility.

44:31.028 --> 44:33.947
Twenty-two stations worldwide
now confirming the signal.

44:34.115 --> 44:35.906

is the signal from-

Lunacharsky is visiting at Cal Tech.

44:42.664 --> 44:44.123
Explain this to me.

44:44.332 --> 44:48.210
If the source of the signal is so
sophisticated, why the remedial math?

44:48.378 --> 44:50.171
Exactly, why don't they speak English?

44:50.338 --> 44:53.549
Maybe because 70 percent of the planet
speaks other languages.

44:53.717 --> 44:56.510
Mathematics is
the only truly universal language.

44:57.220 --> 44:59.805
It's no coincidence
that they're using primes.

45:00.015 --> 45:02.224
- I don't get it.
- Prime numbers.

45:02.392 --> 45:06.187
That would be integers that are
only divisible by themselves and one.

45:09.065 --> 45:12.693
We think this may be a beacon,
some kind of an announcement...

45:12.861 --> 45:13.986
...to get our attention.

45:14.196 --> 45:17.865
If it's attention you want, you got that.
One thing: Vega.

45:18.074 --> 45:21.577
People have been looking at Vega for years
with no results.

45:21.745 --> 45:24.580
And now yesterday they start
broadcasting primes. Why?

45:24.748 --> 45:28.626
Well, it's hardly yesterday, because the
signal has been transmitting for 26 years.

45:28.794 --> 45:30.252

45:36.259 --> 45:40.221

with the firearms to wait outside?

- Excuse me.

Hi, I'm so glad you're back.

45:55.779 --> 45:58.988

Is this great?

45:59.156 --> 46:01.574
- Who are all these people?
- I have no idea.

46:01.784 --> 46:04.744
Sit down. And we could use some help
with the spectrum analysis.

46:04.912 --> 46:06.871
- Listen to that. I'll get on it.
- Headsets.

46:07.039 --> 46:09.123
So I'll just come right to the point,
shall I?

46:09.416 --> 46:13.419
Your having sent this all over the world may
constitute a breach of national security.

46:13.587 --> 46:15.255
This isn't a person-to-person call.

46:15.464 --> 46:19.968
You can't think that a civilization sending
this would intend it just for Americans.

46:20.135 --> 46:21.970
I'm saying you might have consulted us.

46:22.137 --> 46:25.932
- The contents could be extremely sensitive.
- You want to classify prime numbers?

46:26.100 --> 46:29.853
Mike, please. We're only in line
with Vega so many hours a day.

46:30.020 --> 46:34.482
The only way to monitor the signal
is to get the cooperation of other stations.

46:34.650 --> 46:39.028
If Dr. Arroway hadrt acted quickly,
we could have lost key elements.

46:39.196 --> 46:40.822
Okay, fine, they've got the primes.

46:40.990 --> 46:44.117
If you're right about there being a more
significant transmission...

46:44.285 --> 46:45.952
Which will need help
to receive and decode.

is to protect...?

- I hear it.

46:52.334 --> 46:54.085
- Hear what?
- Harmonic.

46:54.253 --> 46:58.506

to retune to 8.9247 gigahertz.

Or, "Sjeg Heil, you're our kind of people."

...examined and scrutinized.

50:50.319 --> 50:53.404

So we canned the other 25
through a series of search algorithms.

...we find this.

01:07:37.939 --> 01:07:40.857
Those look like engineering schematics,
almost like blueprints.

01:07:41.025 --> 01:07:42.651
Yeah.

01:07:42.819 --> 01:07:43.902
Yes.

01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:47.364
It is our belief that
the message contains instructions...

01:07:47.573 --> 01:07:51.034
...for building something,
some kind of machine.

01:07:51.202 --> 01:07:54.329
A machine? That does what, doctor?

01:07:54.497 --> 01:07:56.706
We don't know.
It might be some type...

01:07:57.667 --> 01:08:03.213
...of advanced communication device,
or a teaching machine of some kind.

01:08:03.714 --> 01:08:07.008
Or it might turn out to be
some kind of a transport.

01:08:07.426 --> 01:08:09.886
- Transport?
- There's no proof of that.

The fact is, you don't know what it does.
It could be anything.

Could be a Trojan horse. We build it
and out pours the entire Vegan army.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.229
Why bother risking the personnel?
It could be a weapon.

01:08:20.438 --> 01:08:22.731
Right. Some kind of
a doomsday machine.

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:25.401
Exactly. Every time they detect
a new civilization...

from space.

and blow ourselves to kingdom come.

There's no reason to believe
that their intentions are hostile.

01:08:35.078 --> 01:08:39.415
Why is the default position of the egghead
set that aliens would always be benign?

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:42.042
- Why is that, doctor?
- We pose no threat to them.

01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:46.630
It would be like us going out of our way
to destroy microbes on an anthill in Africa

DRUMLIN:
That's an interesting analogy.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:52.970
And how guilty would we feel if we
destroyed a few microbes on an anthill?

I hope you're right, doctor. I really do.

01:08:55.682 --> 01:08:59.143
But right now my job is to protect
American lives from any threat.

to assume the worst.

Well, yes, and I am forced

My problem is this:

01:09:06.193 --> 01:09:09.403
The content of that message

We won't be suppressing
any opinions here today.

No, of course not. I understand.

What I meant to say...

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:45.104
...is the message was written
in the language of science.

01:09:45.272 --> 01:09:48.649
Now, if it had been religious in nature,
it should have taken the form...

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:51.444
...of a burning bush
or a booming voice from the sky.

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:53.738
But a voice from the sky...

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:57.659
...is exactly what you found,

I'm sorry I'm late, ma'am.

that there are unavoidable...

...religious implications at stake here.

01:10:10.923 --> 01:10:13.341
But that doesn't justify
taking an alarmist position.

a common ground...

01:18:58.986 --> 01:19:01.571
Some of that criticism from scientists.

01:19:01.781 --> 01:19:04.574
One Nobel Prize winner recently noted,
his words:

01:19:05.367 --> 01:19:07.076
"There is every indication...

01:19:07.286 --> 01:19:11.080
...that this is simply beyond our capabilities,
that this endeavor will fail...

01:19:11.290 --> 01:19:14.918
...and that the Machine's occupant
will pay for that failure with their life."

01:19:15.085 --> 01:19:16.753
How do you respond to that?

01:19:16.962 --> 01:19:20.340
ELLIE: Well, this message is from
a civilization that may be anywhere...

01:19:20.549 --> 01:19:24.260
...from hundreds to millions
and millions of years ahead of us.

01:19:24.512 --> 01:19:27.679
I have to believe that
an intelligence that advanced...

01:19:28.306 --> 01:19:30.307
...knows what they're doing.

01:19:31.226 --> 01:19:35.187
Now all it requires on our part is...

01:19:35.355 --> 01:19:36.396
Faith?

01:19:39.484 --> 01:19:41.568
I was gonna say a sense of adventure.

01:19:41.778 --> 01:19:42.986
MAN:
And in breaking news...

01:19:43.571 --> 01:19:44.863
...a former astronaut...

01:19:45.073 --> 01:19:48.909
...considered to be the leading American
candidate for the Machine seat...

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.411
...has unexpectedly dropped out
of the running.

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:54.915
Russell met with reporters this afternoon
at his Houston home.

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:59.211
I told my dad
that I didn't want him to go.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.129
Daddy, don't go.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.885
Nothing would give me more pride
than to...

01:20:07.554 --> 01:20:09.555
...represent my country.

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.932
But what can I say to this?

01:20:12.517 --> 01:20:16.353
Consortium officials had no comment,
but sources within the delegation...

01:20:16.521 --> 01:20:18.522
...have disclosed that Dr. Arroway...

01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:22.776
...appears to now be the front-runner
for the Machine seat.

01:20:23.611 --> 01:20:25.988
ELLIE:
"Meet me at noon. Must talk."

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:28.907
I didn't expect to be getting
a message like this from you.

01:20:29.075 --> 01:20:30.284
Thanks for coming.

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:33.453
So is this kosher?
Fraternizing with the enemy?

01:20:33.621 --> 01:20:37.124
Selectors and selectees mingling around?

01:20:37.292 --> 01:20:39.459
Can we talk about Einstein?

01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:41.795
Yeah, sure. Okay.

01:20:41.963 --> 01:20:43.380
- Special relativity.
- Yeah.

01:20:43.548 --> 01:20:45.173
This machine...

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:50.678
...now, if it works, and you travel to Vega
at even close to the speed of light...

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:53.347
...when you come back...
- If you come back.

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:57.518
If you come back...

01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:01.981
...you'll only be 4 years older, but over
50 years would have passed here on Earth.

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:03.858
Basically, yeah.

01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:06.944
And everybody that you care about...

01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:10.156
...will be gone, dead and buried.

01:21:10.991 --> 01:21:14.994
If you came back,
if you survived at all, which...

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:20.041
Look, Palmer, nobody's saying
this isn't dangerous, all right?

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:24.337
The rest of the candidates and myself,
we fully understand the risks we're taking.

01:21:24.504 --> 01:21:25.755
Why?

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:28.633
Because it's a historic opportunity.
The world needs...

01:21:28.842 --> 01:21:31.469
No, you, Ellie. You. You personally.

01:21:32.512 --> 01:21:35.306
By doing this,
you're willing to give your life.

01:21:35.515 --> 01:21:37.683
You're willing to die for it.

01:21:39.519 --> 01:21:40.811
Why?

01:21:44.524 --> 01:21:48.235
From as long as I can remember,
I've been searching for...

01:21:48.862 --> 01:21:50.529
...something...

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:54.533
...some reason why we're here.
What are we doing here? Who are we?

01:21:55.535 --> 01:21:59.413
If this is a chance to find out
even just a little part of that answer...

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:03.918
I don't know,
I think it's won'th a human life.

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:06.128
Don't you?

01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:15.261
You're an incredibly brave woman, Ellie.

01:22:18.057 --> 01:22:20.183
Or incredibly nuts.

01:22:42.248 --> 01:22:43.748
Palmer...

01:22:49.463 --> 01:22:51.548
I'm really confused.

01:22:52.842 --> 01:22:54.092
So am I.

01:22:55.344 --> 01:22:58.930
I think I speak for us all
when I thank you for your patience.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:02.600
Myself, I have one final question,
Dr. Arroway.

01:23:04.103 --> 01:23:06.438
If you should meet these Vegans...

01:23:06.647 --> 01:23:10.942
...and were permitted only
one question to ask of them...

01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:12.777
...what would it be?

01:23:14.238 --> 01:23:16.281
Well, I suppose it would be:

01:23:16.449 --> 01:23:18.116
"How did you do it?

01:23:18.659 --> 01:23:23.121
How did you evolve? How did you
survive this technological adolescence...

01:23:23.289 --> 01:23:25.206
...without destroying yourself?"

01:23:25.958 --> 01:23:30.837
That more than any other question is one
I personally would like to have answered.

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:33.006
Not too bad, Mike.

01:23:33.674 --> 01:23:34.966
PATEL:
I join Dr. Bergeron...

01:23:35.134 --> 01:23:38.594
...in expressing thanks for
your patience, Dr. Arroway.

01:23:38.803 --> 01:23:41.305
We've all been most impressed
with your candor...

01:23:41.473 --> 01:23:43.515
...and your stamina.

01:23:43.683 --> 01:23:46.852
I believe we are ready to move on
to your final statement.

01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.937
Madam Chairman,
I have one more question.

01:23:49.105 --> 01:23:50.856
Yes, Mr. Joss.

01:23:51.483 --> 01:23:53.484
Dr. Arroway...

01:23:54.861 --> 01:23:57.196
Would you consider yourself...

01:23:57.697 --> 01:24:00.324
...a spiritual person?

01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:04.745
Uh...

01:24:05.497 --> 01:24:08.832
I don't really understand
the point of the question.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.877
I consider myself a moral person.

01:24:12.045 --> 01:24:14.004
PATEL:
I'm sure we all agree that is the case...

01:24:14.172 --> 01:24:16.673
...but I think what Mr. Joss
is in fact asking...

01:24:16.841 --> 01:24:18.675
Do you believe in God...

01:24:20.678 --> 01:24:22.679
...Dr. Arroway?

01:24:27.185 --> 01:24:29.603
As a scientist...

01:24:29.771 --> 01:24:33.232
...I rely on empirical evidence,
and in this matter...

01:24:33.399 --> 01:24:37.111
...I don't believe
that there is data either way.

01:24:37.695 --> 01:24:42.116
PATEL: So your answer would in fact be
that you don't believe in God.

01:24:45.537 --> 01:24:48.580
I don't understand the relevance
of the question.

01:24:49.290 --> 01:24:54.419
Dr. Arroway,
95 percent of the world's population...

01:24:54.587 --> 01:24:58.549
...believes in a supreme being
in one form or another.

01:24:59.717 --> 01:25:02.927
I believe that makes the question
more than relevant.

01:25:05.597 --> 01:25:07.306
PATEL:
Dr. Arroway?

01:25:17.234 --> 01:25:19.235
I believe, um...

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:25.741
I believe I've already
answered that question.

01:25:29.788 --> 01:25:33.291
I'm proud of what
we've achieved as a species...

01:25:33.458 --> 01:25:35.459
...and as a civilization.

01:25:37.129 --> 01:25:39.630

everything we stand for...

01:25:39.798 --> 01:25:43.718
...all that we have fought for
for a thousand generations...

01:25:43.927 --> 01:25:46.262
...all that God has blessed us with...

01:25:47.598 --> 01:25:49.140
...betrayed...

01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:54.687
...in the final hour because we chose to
send a representative who did not put our...

01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:57.982
...most cherished beliefs first.

01:26:01.278 --> 01:26:02.445

Why did you do it?

01:26:41.567 --> 01:26:45.737
Our job was to select someone
to speak for everybody.

01:26:49.033 --> 01:26:52.494
I just couldn't in good conscience
vote for a person...

01:26:52.662 --> 01:26:54.663
...who doesn't believe in God.

01:26:56.707 --> 01:26:58.083
Someone who...

...honestly thinks
the other 95 percent of us...

01:27:01.879 --> 01:27:04.839
...suffer from some form
of mass delusion.

01:27:08.010 --> 01:27:10.095
I told the truth up there.

01:27:11.389 --> 01:27:14.891
And Drumlin told you exactly
what you wanted to hear.

With full humility and utmost gratitude...

Of course.

this is all very unfair.

And maybe that's an understatement.

WOMAN: Go.

01:49:16.488 --> 01:49:18.781
Ellie, we are go for closure.

01:49:20.242 --> 01:49:22.118
I'm go here.

01:49:22.995 --> 01:49:26.497
STEVE: Mechanical, initiate
IPV closure sequence.

01:49:28.125 --> 01:49:30.334
Hold on, let me get you a chair.

01:49:31.044 --> 01:49:32.086
ELLIE:
I'm go.

01:49:32.254 --> 01:49:36.132
- It's nice to smell you again, Mr. Kitz.
- You too.

01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:38.134
Wouldrt peg him as a Polo man.

01:49:47.686 --> 01:49:49.020
I got a visual on the door.

01:49:49.187 --> 01:49:51.147
WOMAN:
IPV escape system is armed.

01:49:51.315 --> 01:49:53.316
Door is looking good.

01:49:58.530 --> 01:50:00.197
Door alignment looks good.

01:50:28.809 --> 01:50:30.894
Ellie, we are showing green
across the board.

01:50:31.062 --> 01:50:34.397
Copy that, Control. IPV is secure.

01:50:41.530 --> 01:50:43.531
GERRY:
We are at 30 percent.

01:50:43.699 --> 01:50:44.991
Copy that, 30 percent.

01:50:49.872 --> 01:50:52.540
- How you doing in there, EI?
- Kent?

01:50:53.292 --> 01:50:56.086
- Is that you?
- That's a big affirmative.

01:50:57.004 --> 01:50:58.588
Who let you in there, huh?

01:50:58.756 --> 01:51:00.882
A higher power intervened.

01:51:02.927 --> 01:51:04.260
Well, I'm glad you came.

01:51:09.016 --> 01:51:10.183
GERRY:
Thirty-five percent.

01:51:10.935 --> 01:51:12.435
Copy that, 35 percent.

01:51:12.603 --> 01:51:13.937
- Mechanical?
- We're good.

01:51:14.105 --> 01:51:15.438
Forty percent.

01:51:19.068 --> 01:51:20.944
I'm picking up a moderate vibration here.

01:51:22.113 --> 01:51:25.740
- Dynamics, can you confirm vibration?
GERRY: Everything looks good here.

01:51:25.950 --> 01:51:29.202
She's feeling the same thing
they felt at the Cape at this point.

01:51:29.370 --> 01:51:30.954
Ellie, the vibration is normal.

01:51:31.122 --> 01:51:33.622
GERRY: We are at 50 percent.
All systems nominal.

01:51:33.790 --> 01:51:35.791
Copy that, 50 percent.

01:51:40.964 --> 01:51:42.965
Vibration is getting a little stronger now.

01:51:43.133 --> 01:51:45.968
We're picking up
some low-frequency noise.

01:51:46.344 --> 01:51:49.430
- Mechanical, can you confirm?
- It looks fine to me.

01:51:49.597 --> 01:51:52.975
STEVE: Roger. Gerry, what do you think?
- I'm still go.

01:51:53.143 --> 01:51:54.768
People, we are still go.

01:51:56.521 --> 01:51:58.981
What...? Something's happening.

01:52:00.233 --> 01:52:02.901
I'm... There's...

01:52:03.069 --> 01:52:05.904
There's a light. Do you see that?
I'm seeing some...

01:52:06.656 --> 01:52:09.116
Something, some...

01:52:09.284 --> 01:52:11.827
I can't tell whether it's daylight or not.

01:52:11.995 --> 01:52:14.913
There it is again.
It's coming from the bottom.

01:52:15.957 --> 01:52:17.499
Here, let me show you. See that?

01:52:17.667 --> 01:52:19.585
Negative. Ellie, you're breaking up.

01:52:19.753 --> 01:52:22.588
- Comm 1, can we boost her signal?
- Already at maximum.

01:52:22.756 --> 01:52:24.298
GERRY:
Sixty-five percent.

01:52:24.466 --> 01:52:26.175
The material is changing.

01:52:26.342 --> 01:52:29.845
It's bordering on translucence.
But the system is intact.

01:52:33.141 --> 01:52:37.519
It's gotta be some kind
of electromagnetic field.

01:52:37.687 --> 01:52:40.689
- Are you reading this?
- Negative, we're seeing only interference.

01:52:40.857 --> 01:52:46.195
It's becoming completely translucent.
I can't describe it. I can't even explain it.

01:52:48.656 --> 01:52:49.698
Seventy percent.

01:52:49.866 --> 01:52:52.201
People, we have intermittent comm,
but we are go.

01:52:52.368 --> 01:52:56.829
- Initiate secondary drive systems.
GERRY: Initiating auxiliary booster sequence.

01:52:57.039 --> 01:52:58.873
MAN:
We're go for ignition.

01:53:05.923 --> 01:53:08.382
We have auxiliary booster ignition.

01:53:14.056 --> 01:53:15.556
Life support, how is she doing?

01:53:15.724 --> 01:53:18.976
We still have data. Heart and respiration
are high but within limits.

01:53:19.144 --> 01:53:20.228
Ellie, do you copy?

01:53:20.437 --> 01:53:23.439
If you could hear, I am okay to go.

01:53:27.236 --> 01:53:29.028
If you could hear me...

01:53:32.115 --> 01:53:33.491
Eighty percent.

01:53:33.659 --> 01:53:36.494
All vibration and G-levels are in the green.

01:53:41.917 --> 01:53:44.252
Control, if you're reading me...

01:53:44.419 --> 01:53:46.754
...I am okay to go. Okay to go,

01:53:46.922 --> 01:53:50.716
GERRY: Eighty-five percent.
MAN: All bearing tips are on the profile.

01:53:51.593 --> 01:53:54.679
Ninety percent. We're detecting
some structural instability.

01:53:54.847 --> 01:53:58.766
- Confirmed. Is she holding?
- We're within limits, barely.

01:54:00.269 --> 01:54:06.190
I'm okay to go.

01:54:12.114 --> 01:54:13.573
My God!

01:54:24.625 --> 01:54:27.127
Okay to go. I'm okay.

01:54:27.545 --> 01:54:29.045
Hundred percent target velocity.

01:54:29.213 --> 01:54:30.422
MAN:
Steve?

01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:34.968
Tremendous EMI levels around the Machine.
All field measurements are off-scale.

01:54:35.136 --> 01:54:37.596
Steve, we're approaching our abort limits.

01:54:39.974 --> 01:54:41.057
Okay to go.

01:54:46.272 --> 01:54:47.480
I hear her!

01:54:47.648 --> 01:54:50.483
I hear her. Barely, but she's there.

01:54:50.651 --> 01:54:53.653
- Okay to go.
- She says she's okay to go.

01:54:56.657 --> 01:54:58.783
Steve, we're real close.

01:54:58.951 --> 01:55:01.828
- Electrical, reading in the core?
MAN: Internal environment normal.

01:55:01.996 --> 01:55:04.998
Inside the core, the weather's beautiful.

01:55:09.086 --> 01:55:10.337
I'm okay to go.

01:55:10.838 --> 01:55:14.299
Okay to go. I'm okay to go.

01:55:14.884 --> 01:55:17.218
STEVE:
Initiate drop sequence.

01:55:19.805 --> 01:55:21.514
On my mark.

01:55:22.224 --> 01:55:24.768
Ten, nine...

01:55:25.853 --> 01:55:27.854
...eight...

01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:31.191
...seven, six...

01:55:31.359 --> 01:55:33.985
...five, four...

01:55:34.153 --> 01:55:36.821
...three, two...

01:55:36.989 --> 01:55:38.365
I'm okay to go.

01:55:42.328 --> 01:55:44.119
Oh, God!

01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:55.047
Ellie to Control.

01:55:55.715 --> 01:56:05.766
Ellie to Control, do you read me?

01:56:11.523 --> 01:56:14.942
I'm gonna try to keep recording.

01:56:15.694 --> 01:56:20.239
I'm going through
some kind of a tunnel.

01:56:34.921 --> 01:56:36.463
There's a light source ahead.

01:56:36.965 --> 01:56:40.175
Brilliant and blue-white.

01:56:41.386 --> 01:56:43.012
Residual radiation?

01:56:54.774 --> 01:56:56.066
It's a star.

01:56:56.651 --> 01:57:00.070
I must have gone through a wormhole.

01:57:05.118 --> 01:57:06.535
It's Vega.

01:57:17.755 --> 01:57:19.297
I'm in another wormhole now.

01:57:22.968 --> 01:57:24.093
I had no idea.

01:57:24.261 --> 01:57:26.054
A series of them.

01:57:29.058 --> 01:57:30.308
They're alive.

01:57:30.476 --> 01:57:34.437
It's like some kind of a transit system.

01:57:35.439 --> 01:57:36.814
It's a subway.

01:57:36.982 --> 01:57:38.483
[YELLS]

01:57:42.154 --> 01:57:43.946
Okay.

01:57:44.114 --> 01:57:46.407
Okay, I've gotta keep talking.

01:57:48.952 --> 01:57:52.830
It's a triple... No, quadruple system.

01:57:53.248 --> 01:57:54.499
It's beautiful.

01:57:57.836 --> 01:57:59.253
They're alive.

01:58:07.429 --> 01:58:09.097
Another wormhole!

01:58:09.431 --> 01:58:11.265
This one is much more violent!

01:59:44.692 --> 01:59:46.359
Some...

01:59:46.819 --> 01:59:49.154
...celestial event...

01:59:50.406 --> 01:59:52.115
No...

01:59:52.283 --> 01:59:55.951
No words. No words...

01:59:57.621 --> 01:59:59.830
...to describe it.

02:00:01.249 --> 02:00:03.125
Poetry.

02:00:04.294 --> 02:00:07.796
They should have sent a poet.

02:00:08.089 --> 02:00:10.674
It's so beautiful.

02:00:10.842 --> 02:00:12.301
Beautiful.

02:00:14.137 --> 02:00:19.433
So beautiful.

02:00:20.310 --> 02:00:26.899
I had no idea.

02:00:28.151 --> 02:00:31.487
I had no...

02:00:32.781 --> 02:00:36.075
I had no idea.

02:00:37.410 --> 02:00:44.416
I had no idea. I had no idea.

02:03:02.387 --> 02:03:03.762
Hi, Sparks.

02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:07.140
Dad?

02:03:14.607 --> 02:03:16.483
I missed you.

02:03:22.115 --> 02:03:23.281
Arert you...?

02:03:23.491 --> 02:03:26.701
I'm sorry I couldn't
be there for you, sweetheart.

02:03:36.504 --> 02:03:38.171
You're not real.

02:03:39.674 --> 02:03:41.174
None of this is real.

02:03:41.342 --> 02:03:43.510
That's my scientist.

02:03:44.595 --> 02:03:48.974
When I was unconscious, you downloaded
my thoughts, my memory even.

02:03:49.809 --> 02:03:51.852
Pensacola.

02:03:54.355 --> 02:03:57.315
We thought this might
make things easier for you.

02:04:10.829 --> 02:04:14.457
- Why did you contact us?
- You contacted us.

02:04:14.624 --> 02:04:16.292
We were just listening.

02:04:17.169 --> 02:04:18.461
And there are others?

02:04:18.628 --> 02:04:20.254
Many others.

02:04:25.093 --> 02:04:26.594
They all...

02:04:26.761 --> 02:04:29.889
...travel here through that
transit system that you built?

02:04:30.432 --> 02:04:31.932
We didn't build it.

02:04:33.101 --> 02:04:34.602
We don't know who did.

02:04:36.688 --> 02:04:39.648
No, they were gone
long before we ever got here.

02:04:40.275 --> 02:04:42.109
Maybe someday they'll come back.

02:04:42.944 --> 02:04:45.654
All the other civilizations that you find,
they come here?

02:04:45.864 --> 02:04:47.072
Not all.

02:04:48.867 --> 02:04:52.036
- Is this some test?
- No, no tests.

02:04:54.956 --> 02:04:56.540
You have your mother's hands.

02:05:06.718 --> 02:05:08.886
You're an interesting species...

02:05:09.554 --> 02:05:11.514
...an interesting mix.

02:05:12.432 --> 02:05:15.226
You're capable of
such beautiful dreams...

02:05:16.269 --> 02:05:18.729
...and such horrible nightmares.

02:05:19.898 --> 02:05:21.732
You feel so lost...

02:05:22.317 --> 02:05:25.277
...so cut off, so alone.

02:05:26.738 --> 02:05:28.489
Only you're not.

02:05:30.574 --> 02:05:32.116
See...

02:05:32.576 --> 02:05:34.202
In all our searching...

02:05:34.411 --> 02:05:37.914
...the only thing we've found
that makes the emptiness bearable...

02:05:38.082 --> 02:05:39.707
...is each other.

02:05:43.462 --> 02:05:45.380
What happens now?

02:05:46.423 --> 02:05:47.924
Now?

02:05:48.842 --> 02:05:50.635
You go home.

02:05:50.803 --> 02:05:52.220
ELLIE:
Home?

02:05:52.388 --> 02:05:55.473
But I have so many questions.

02:05:55.641 --> 02:05:57.767
Do we get to come back?

02:05:58.644 --> 02:06:00.895
This was just a first step.

02:06:01.063 --> 02:06:02.814
In time, you'll take another.

02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:06.776
But other people need to see
what I've seen...

02:06:06.944 --> 02:06:09.988
This is the way it's been done
for billions of years.

02:06:11.991 --> 02:06:14.617
- But I...
- Small moves, Ellie.

02:06:16.078 --> 02:06:17.996
Small moves.

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:02.873
We've got video on Ellie.
Five-by-five.

02:07:03.082 --> 02:07:04.958
STEVE:
She's through! She is in the net.

02:07:05.126 --> 02:07:08.128
She's alive. Get the White House.
Get the president on the phone.

02:07:08.296 --> 02:07:10.672
What's going on, Steve? How is she?
How is she?

02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:12.549
STEVE:
Ellie, this is Control. Do you copy?

02:07:12.717 --> 02:07:14.760
KENT: What's going on?
- I don't know. Hang on.

02:07:14.927 --> 02:07:16.553
- She is alive.
STEVE: Put her on the PA.

02:07:16.721 --> 02:07:18.305
Ellie, just hold on tight.

02:07:18.931 --> 02:07:22.225
We're still trying to determine
the nature of the malfunction...

02:07:22.393 --> 02:07:24.895
...but the important thing is you're okay.

02:07:25.063 --> 02:07:26.229
What?

02:07:26.397 --> 02:07:30.192
It's all right, Ellie.
The important thing is that you're safe.

02:07:31.152 --> 02:07:33.445
What malfunction?

02:07:34.781 --> 02:07:36.239
What...?

02:07:37.408 --> 02:07:39.034
What happened?

02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:42.037
What day is this?

02:07:42.705 --> 02:07:45.707
I'm sorry, Ellie,
did you say what day?

02:07:46.793 --> 02:07:49.044
How long was I gone?

02:07:50.797 --> 02:07:55.592
Ellie, the IPV dropped
straight through the Machine.

02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:57.427
You didn't go anywhere.

02:07:58.304 --> 02:08:01.640
But I did. I did go.

02:08:01.808 --> 02:08:04.184
That's what I've been trying
to tell everyone.

02:08:08.648 --> 02:08:11.733
But the headset
didn't record a single image?

02:08:11.901 --> 02:08:14.528
Just this. Static.

02:08:14.737 --> 02:08:15.779
Thank you.

02:08:15.947 --> 02:08:19.365
Now, doctor, let me show you
what we saw.

02:08:28.834 --> 02:08:32.670
Forty-three separate remote cameras
show exactly the same event.

02:08:32.838 --> 02:08:34.380
The IPV dropped straight through.

02:08:34.548 --> 02:08:38.134
Everyone who watched
saw exactly the same thing.

02:08:38.301 --> 02:08:40.136
Nothing happened.

02:08:41.471 --> 02:08:43.764
How do you explain this, doctor?

02:08:45.767 --> 02:08:46.892
I can't.

02:08:47.102 --> 02:08:48.561
CLINTON:
I would encourage you...

02:08:50.355 --> 02:08:54.525
...not to inflame this situation
beyond the facts.

02:08:54.693 --> 02:08:58.112
Let us deal with this on the facts.

02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:01.157
We are monitoring
what has actually happened.

02:09:01.324 --> 02:09:06.662
We are taking what we believe
is factually appropriate steps.

02:09:06.830 --> 02:09:10.040
Amid a flurry of accusations
and counter-accusations...

02:09:10.250 --> 02:09:12.835
...by the nations representing
the Machine Consortium...

02:09:13.003 --> 02:09:15.921
...the president has ordered
a special inquiry.

02:09:16.131 --> 02:09:18.924
However, the appointment
to the committee of Michael Kitz...

02:09:19.134 --> 02:09:21.969
...who has recently resigned
as National Security Advisor...

02:09:22.137 --> 02:09:24.472
...has raised a number of eyebrows
on Capitol Hill.

02:09:24.639 --> 02:09:28.434
I have made no decision to run for
Congress, I have announced no candidacy.

02:09:28.602 --> 02:09:31.187
The fact that I resigned
as National Security Advisor...

02:09:31.354 --> 02:09:33.063
...has nothing to do with anything...

02:09:33.231 --> 02:09:36.400
...other than I want to devote
all of my energy to this inquiry.

02:09:37.152 --> 02:09:41.821
The people of the world have a right
to know what really happened.

02:09:42.656 --> 02:09:45.158
And yet every scientific
instrument confirms...

02:09:45.326 --> 02:09:49.496
...the IPV was out of contact
for only a fraction of a second.

02:09:49.663 --> 02:09:51.706
Isn't that correct, doctor?

02:09:53.417 --> 02:09:55.710
A fraction of a second Earth time, yes.

02:09:56.587 --> 02:09:57.837
SENATOR:
Earth time?

02:09:58.005 --> 02:10:01.633
ELLIE: Senator, I believe that the Machine
opened up a wormhole...

02:10:01.801 --> 02:10:06.763
...a tunnel through the fabric of space-time,
also known as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

02:10:06.931 --> 02:10:11.059
Now, because of the effects of general
relativity, what I experienced as 18 hours...

02:10:11.227 --> 02:10:13.478
...passed instantaneously on Earth.

02:10:13.646 --> 02:10:17.982
Isn't it true that these wormholes you
speak of are merely theoretical predictions?

02:10:18.150 --> 02:10:20.902
There is no evidence
they actually exist, is there?

02:10:21.070 --> 02:10:22.779
ELLIE:
There is no direct evidence, no.

02:10:22.947 --> 02:10:24.697
KITZ:
Tell me something, doctor...

02:10:24.865 --> 02:10:27.992
...why do you think these aliens
would go to all this trouble?

02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:32.372
Bring you tens of thousands of light years
and then send you home without proof?

02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:35.750
They said that's how it's been done
for billions of years.

02:10:36.126 --> 02:10:39.712
KITZ: That's very neat. You have no proof
because they didn't want you to have any.

02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:44.634
A phenomenon known in psychiatric circles,
I believe, as a self-reinforcing delusion.

02:10:45.219 --> 02:10:46.845
Is that what you think? Delusional?

02:10:47.012 --> 02:10:51.140
KITZ: Well, I do think you may have suffered
some kind of an episode. Yeah, I do.

02:10:51.308 --> 02:10:54.185
Doctor, I'd like to propose
an alternate hypothesis...

02:10:54.395 --> 02:10:58.064
...and I'd like you to bring
your scientific expertise to bear on it.

02:10:58.232 --> 02:11:01.442
To fake a signal from Vega...

02:11:02.111 --> 02:11:03.695
...what would you need?

02:11:05.405 --> 02:11:09.199
You would need a satellite to transmit
the signal, but it would be impossible to...

02:11:09.367 --> 02:11:13.287
You'd need a satellite and need launch
capabilities to put the satellite into orbit.

02:11:13.454 --> 02:11:16.665
And the message itself.
To put something like this together...

02:11:16.833 --> 02:11:19.126
...so complex,
drawing on many disciplines...

02:11:19.294 --> 02:11:21.253
- Would be impossible.
KITZ: Impossible?

02:11:22.547 --> 02:11:24.464
Impossible?

02:11:24.632 --> 02:11:28.260
Is there anyone who might
have been up to the challenge?

02:11:28.428 --> 02:11:30.888
Someone with extraordinary
technical expertise...

02:11:31.055 --> 02:11:33.265
...enormous financial resources...

02:11:33.433 --> 02:11:37.811
...someone perverse enough,
eccentric enough to come up with the idea?

02:11:39.188 --> 02:11:40.230
Hadden?

02:11:41.190 --> 02:11:43.650
S. R. Hadden.

[CROWD MURMURING]

You're implying that this was
all some kind of a hoax?

02:11:51.159 --> 02:11:52.409
That he engineered this?

KITZ:
S. R. Hadden...

02:11:53.995 --> 02:11:58.874
...a legendary power broker and manipulator
in perhaps his final bid for immortality.

02:11:59.042 --> 02:12:01.710
Maybe he wanted to explore
and exploit new technologies...

02:12:01.878 --> 02:12:04.087
...and get the governments
to pick up the tab.

02:12:04.297 --> 02:12:07.049
Perhaps this was his
final altruistic gesture...

02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:11.011
...to unite the world in some common goal.
Maybe all of the above.

02:12:11.179 --> 02:12:16.099
S. R. Hadden, a brilliant
and complicated man.

02:12:18.645 --> 02:12:22.898
Doctor, are you familiar
with the scientific precept...

02:12:23.066 --> 02:12:25.192
...known as Occam's razor?

02:12:31.406 --> 02:12:32.573
ELLIE:
Yes.

02:12:34.576 --> 02:12:36.661
It means that all things being equal...

02:12:36.828 --> 02:12:39.330
...the simplest explanation
tends to be the right one.

02:12:39.498 --> 02:12:41.040
KITZ:
Exactly.

02:12:41.208 --> 02:12:43.668
Now, you tell me.
What is more likely here?

02:12:43.835 --> 02:12:47.296
That a message from aliens
results in a magical machine...

02:12:47.464 --> 02:12:50.174
...that whisks you away
to the center of the galaxy...

02:12:50.384 --> 02:12:53.260
...to go windsurfing with your dad
and a split second later...

02:12:53.428 --> 02:12:56.889
...returns you home
without a single shred of proof?

02:12:57.057 --> 02:13:00.851
Or that your experience
is the result of being...

02:13:01.019 --> 02:13:05.481
...the unwitting star in the farewell
performance of one S.R. Hadden?

A man with the means, motive and
opportunity to play you and the rest of us...

most expensive hoax of all time?

Only a story that, to put it mildly,
strains credibility.

Over half a trillion dollars were spent.

Dozens of lives were lost.

Are you really gonna sit there
and tell us we should just take this all...

Please answer the question, doctor.

02:13:54.864 --> 02:13:56.948
Is it possible that it didn't happen?

Yes.

As a scientist I must concede that.
I must volunteer that.

02:14:08.627 --> 02:14:10.545
KITZ:
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.

02:14:10.713 --> 02:14:14.591
You admit you have absolutely no
physical evidence to back up your story?

02:14:14.925 --> 02:14:15.967
Yes.

You admit that you very well may have
hallucinated this whole thing?

02:14:19.346 --> 02:14:22.140
- Yes.
- You admit that if you were in our position...

02:14:22.308 --> 02:14:26.061
...you would respond with exactly the same
degree of incredulity and skepticism?

02:14:26.228 --> 02:14:27.479
Yes.

02:14:27.646 --> 02:14:30.607
Then why don't you simply withdraw
your testimony and concede...

02:14:30.775 --> 02:14:35.945
...that this journey to the center of
the galaxy in fact never took place?

02:14:38.949 --> 02:14:40.950

I can't prove it. I can't even explain it.

But everything that I know as
a human being, everything I am...

...of the universe...

A vision that tells us

...that is greater than ourselves,
that we are not... That none of us are alone.
