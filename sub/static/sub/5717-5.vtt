WEBVTT

00:03.377 --> 00:06.862
Douglas Goddard telephoned.
Seems he's trying to chase you down.

00:06.908 --> 00:10.628
Well, if you're not doing anything this
evening, perhaps we might have dinner.

00:10.748 --> 00:13.628
Can you write? Why don't
you show me what you can do?

00:13.948 --> 00:15.548
Write me a critique, a review.

00:17.250 --> 00:22.856
I wanted to thank you for today
but, I am a happily married woman.

00:26.601 --> 00:28.201
How often do they
have to be watered?

00:28.281 --> 00:29.881
Every day for the first month.

00:31.316 --> 00:32.876
Why were you working at Carlo's?

00:35.087 --> 00:37.807
Lie down. I've changed my mind!

00:40.927 --> 00:43.927
Linda's very sick, Nancy.
She needs to go to the hospital.

00:44.108 --> 00:46.908
Hysterectomy at 15.
The uterine wall's perforated.

00:48.879 --> 00:51.119
The man was a butcher.
He should be struck off.

00:51.371 --> 00:53.771
I don't know how I'm going
to tell Rene about the baby.

02:39.529 --> 02:41.369
You can't avoid me forever,
you know.

02:42.273 --> 02:46.553
If you had any decency, you'd leave.
Is that what you want from me?

02:47.445 --> 02:50.765
Decency?
I have a husband.

02:50.845 --> 02:52.885
You do.

03:17.165 --> 03:18.845
Darling, the portrait.

03:19.165 --> 03:23.285
Truth be told, I'm not convinced
the artist is a good fit for us.

03:23.685 --> 03:26.565
His style, I'm worried
it's too modern.

03:26.805 --> 03:28.645
Well, I think Lloyd's
a decent chap,

03:28.925 --> 03:31.205
and I trust Aunt Carolyn's
recommendation.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.885
He makes me feel uncomfortable.

03:33.085 --> 03:34.685
Darling, it's natural to be shy.

03:34.845 --> 03:37.085
Besides, I want
a memento of this happy time,

03:37.365 --> 03:39.565
so I'm afraid
I'm putting my foot down.

03:40.205 --> 03:42.485
Acceptances are flooding in
for the little prince.

03:43.605 --> 03:45.365
Whom, I believe, needs changing.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.720
Rose, would you mind?

03:49.100 --> 03:52.540
Come here, my handsome lad.
Hey.

03:52.570 --> 03:54.130
Bye-bye, Georgie. Bye-bye.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.370
Bye.

03:58.530 --> 04:01.570
Ah. How's my bonny boy
this morning?

04:01.630 --> 04:03.350
Good morning, George. Good morning.
Good morning.

04:03.370 --> 04:05.210
Morning.
I trust you slept well?

04:07.770 --> 04:09.730
I won't take any this morning.

04:09.890 --> 04:11.610
But the doctor...

04:11.770 --> 04:14.010
Is not here and I'm sure would agree
I'm in good health.

04:14.090 --> 04:17.510
Besides, I want to have my wits about me
from now on. I've seen the flyers in town.

04:17.570 --> 04:19.130
Mrs Collins has been very thorough.

04:19.209 --> 04:20.649
No telegraph pole left untouched.

04:20.730 --> 04:22.530
It's not premature?

04:22.650 --> 04:24.950
You haven't received
the official nod yet.

04:25.021 --> 04:26.581
The emphasis on 'yet'.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.501
It's a forum,
not a political speech.

04:28.621 --> 04:31.981
If I'm to represent the district,
I want to know their concerns.

04:32.061 --> 04:33.901
Spoken like a true statesman.

04:56.701 --> 04:59.021
I don't want a nurse.

05:00.781 --> 05:03.501
I want a wife.
You have a wife.

05:11.301 --> 05:12.981
Rene, please.

05:15.741 --> 05:16.741
It's been days.

05:19.381 --> 05:22.261
I know this is a
difficult situation,

05:22.341 --> 05:24.181
but I can't change what's happened.

05:26.181 --> 05:28.021
We're having a baby.

05:28.101 --> 05:31.101
No! No, you are having a baby.

05:32.061 --> 05:33.621
I thought you were dead.

05:34.541 --> 05:37.621
Jules Manet, he saw you shot
in the head, trying to escape!

05:38.021 --> 05:39.061
You did not wait for me!

05:39.301 --> 05:42.981
I did! I went to the station
every day, searching for you,

05:43.061 --> 05:45.221
for news of you, mon amore.

05:50.621 --> 05:53.421
Don't you dare
question my love for you.

05:56.061 --> 05:59.101
You have no idea, the things I did,

05:59.181 --> 06:02.341
to survive, to be with you again.

06:03.941 --> 06:05.941
I wish you had never found me.

06:11.781 --> 06:13.621
Thank you.

06:16.021 --> 06:17.581
A politician.

06:17.661 --> 06:19.941
You must be so proud.

06:20.061 --> 06:23.341
Well, there remain a number
of hoops to be jumped through.

06:23.421 --> 06:25.701
Not according to Sir Richard.

06:30.621 --> 06:32.501
A little birdy tells me

06:32.661 --> 06:36.901
that you've been giving private recitals at
Douglas Goddard's soup kitchen.

06:36.981 --> 06:39.221
Refuge.

06:39.341 --> 06:42.861
And, yes, music does have proven
benefits, as you could witness

06:42.941 --> 06:44.741
for yourself, if you paid a visit.

06:44.861 --> 06:48.101
My dear, I'm run off my feet
selling tickets to the ball.

06:49.141 --> 06:52.061
But how Bolshevik of you to
roll up your sleeves and muck in.

06:53.701 --> 06:55.201
I intend to propose to
the committee that we

06:55.202 --> 06:57.261
raise funds for unwed mothers next.

06:57.381 --> 07:01.141
Well, aren't you the suffragette.
Look at you, you're wearing purple.

07:01.261 --> 07:04.541
Next you'll
be throwing yourself under horses.

07:22.501 --> 07:25.341
Can't you smoke around the back
with the rest of the staff?

07:25.461 --> 07:27.821
Well, you'd know all about
the tradesman's entrance.

07:27.841 --> 07:29.501
Aren't you chirpy!
Let me guess, George managed

07:29.581 --> 07:32.301
to look at you without retching.

07:32.421 --> 07:35.141
So, how is your
precious country doctor?

07:35.221 --> 07:36.901
A little unsettled?

07:37.021 --> 07:42.741
The poor creature did pale somewhat,
digesting news of your sordid past.

07:42.861 --> 07:45.621
It's not surprising, really.
Your cavalcade of ex-lovers

07:45.741 --> 07:47.741
would make a streetwalker blush.
If you cross me

07:47.861 --> 07:50.261
when it comes to Jack...
Indeed.

07:50.341 --> 07:52.341
That's how I feel about George.

07:57.941 --> 08:01.341
Sweet James. Such a sensitive boy.

08:01.421 --> 08:03.541
What are you saying?

08:03.661 --> 08:09.141
I think it's clear. He's so
vulnerable to scandal and innuendo.

08:13.901 --> 08:16.661
Carolyn? Carolyn.

08:16.821 --> 08:18.261
He's busy, Carolyn.

08:18.421 --> 08:19.621
Carolyn!

08:19.861 --> 08:22.061
Good morning.
There is something

08:22.341 --> 08:23.701
that you need to know...
He's still recovering.

08:23.702 --> 08:28.061
Be quiet! Regina is using James's
secret as a weapon to ensure her

08:28.141 --> 08:30.541
continued presence at Ash Park.

08:30.621 --> 08:32.181
She is threatening to expose him.

08:32.301 --> 08:34.981
It sickens me
and I will not tolerate it.

08:35.101 --> 08:37.981
How could you say such a thing?
Do you deny it?

08:39.900 --> 08:43.741
Is this true?
George, you know I love James.

08:43.861 --> 08:46.101
I would
never do anything to hurt him.

08:46.181 --> 08:47.981
Is it true?

08:49.821 --> 08:53.061
I don't deny the charge.

08:54.661 --> 08:56.581
But you must hear the context.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.221
Without, the words are monstrous.

08:58.301 --> 09:00.741
What I said about James,

09:00.861 --> 09:04.781
it was that terrible night
I sought refuge here after that...

09:04.861 --> 09:06.541
brute raised a hand to me.

09:06.661 --> 09:08.781
What are you talking about?
Don't believe her, George.

09:08.901 --> 09:11.981
Let her speak.
You saw me. I was petrified.

09:12.061 --> 09:14.141
I was not in my right mind.

09:14.261 --> 09:16.981
I regret saying it now but
I was sure you would turn me away.

09:17.141 --> 09:18.101
This never happened!

09:18.181 --> 09:20.461
You know how much I adore James.

09:22.981 --> 09:26.261
I am ashamed I said
such a disgusting thing.

09:28.221 --> 09:31.861
It was a hollow threat,
born of terror.

09:34.101 --> 09:36.621
I'm so very, very sorry.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.061
George, this is lies.

09:39.181 --> 09:41.981
She made the same threat
to me only two minutes ago!

09:42.001 --> 09:42.921
She has always hated me...
Enough!

09:42.941 --> 09:44.421
You know that I would
never deceive you...

09:44.501 --> 09:45.941
That is enough!

09:52.221 --> 09:55.901
I will never presume
to come between blood.

09:55.981 --> 09:59.981
Carolyn is your sister.

10:00.061 --> 10:03.341
You must stand with her.

10:05.261 --> 10:07.541
I will return to the farmhouse.

10:07.621 --> 10:09.661
That would be your decision.

10:14.621 --> 10:15.941
I stopped by the Kirkpatricks'.

10:17.421 --> 10:19.341
And I want to
pop in to the Aboriginal mission.

10:19.541 --> 10:21.541
Tilly Harrison's
having her fifth child.

10:21.941 --> 10:23.381
I'm concerned she's hypertensive.

10:23.501 --> 10:25.301
Do you remember that
bastard's address?

10:26.981 --> 10:30.141
The one who butchered Linda.
Jack.

10:32.461 --> 10:34.161
The thought that he is
doing it again, right now,

10:34.181 --> 10:36.901
to some other poor girl...
You did everything you could.

10:38.501 --> 10:40.861
And you've lied on
Linda's death certificate.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.341
To protect her honour.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.701
And by doing that,
I'm protecting him.

10:45.781 --> 10:46.581
I know.

10:50.741 --> 10:51.941
I'll just sign paperwork,

10:52.061 --> 10:54.641
shall I, while another dozen girls
are dumped outside Crown Street,

10:54.642 --> 10:56.061
bleeding to death.

11:05.021 --> 11:10.341
Oh, Gino! Look, it's our invitation
to the christening. How lovely.

11:10.421 --> 11:12.221
We're not going, Anna.

11:13.901 --> 11:17.221
If this is about James...
I told Carlo I'd help him with the harvest.

11:17.581 --> 11:19.341
Why is his farm more
important than ours?

11:19.461 --> 11:23.941
Bella, trust me, what I'm
doing here, it's for our future.

11:25.621 --> 11:26.981
You said it wouldn't be like this.

11:27.181 --> 11:29.381
Like what?
Like your parents.

11:29.461 --> 11:31.781
Working all the time.

11:31.861 --> 11:34.261
I'm so tired, Gino.

11:34.381 --> 11:36.361
If you weren't up all night,
writing your novel...

11:36.381 --> 11:39.021
That's the only chance I get!
Why are you getting like this?

11:39.141 --> 11:41.381
Huh? You knew you
were marrying a farmer.

11:52.861 --> 11:55.661
I am black and blue,
thanks to your incompetence.

11:55.781 --> 11:59.741
You found every pothole between
Ash Park and this godforsaken dump.

11:59.901 --> 12:03.041
If you think you're getting a tip,
then you're more stupid than you appear.

12:05.021 --> 12:07.261
Excuse me!

12:24.821 --> 12:27.941
A long-distance call,
please, Mildred. M2248.

12:28.021 --> 12:30.341
Sir Richard Bennett.

12:33.021 --> 12:33.981
Mrs Poletti to see you.

12:35.501 --> 12:38.221
I was just thinking about you.

12:38.301 --> 12:39.941
Tea, please, Rose.

12:42.821 --> 12:45.621
I hardly see you
now you're Mrs Poletti.

12:47.221 --> 12:48.781
Anna, what's wrong?

12:50.061 --> 12:53.221
Is it Gino?

12:53.341 --> 12:54.861
He's not unwell, is he?
Oh, I wouldn't know.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.941
I never see him.

12:57.061 --> 13:00.781
Oh, come and sit.
He would be so angry that I'm here,

13:00.861 --> 13:03.421
but I didn't know where else to go.

13:03.501 --> 13:05.501
Angry?

13:05.581 --> 13:07.421
Why?

13:07.501 --> 13:11.021
Livvie, it's just all such a mess!

13:11.141 --> 13:14.021
We fought tooth and nail to
be together and now it's as though

13:14.101 --> 13:16.101
we've turned on each other.

13:16.181 --> 13:18.221
Surely, it's not that bad.

13:18.301 --> 13:20.061
No, it's worse.

13:20.181 --> 13:24.781
Something always needs
chopping, or scrubbing, or watering.

13:24.901 --> 13:27.701
And Gino spends more time
at Carlo's farm than ours

13:27.821 --> 13:32.101
and I have no idea why, and I just
wonder if our marriage is cursed!

13:32.221 --> 13:35.301
Ever since Andrew Swanson
and that loathsome letter.

13:39.461 --> 13:41.741
Letter? No, I didn't come
to talk about that.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.221
Anna. What letter?

13:45.301 --> 13:47.741
It was just Andrew being hateful.

13:58.981 --> 14:00.821
What did he say?

14:01.301 --> 14:06.781
He just made up the most horrible
story about you and baby Georgie.

14:07.901 --> 14:11.661
That he isn't yours.
That he was bought at the hospital.

14:13.781 --> 14:18.741
Oh, Livvie, I'm so sorry! Please,
just forget I said anything at all.

14:20.021 --> 14:21.541
I know that you were close to Andrew,

14:21.781 --> 14:25.301
so this will come as a shock but...
Please, Livvie.

14:25.621 --> 14:28.061
Oh, darling, look at me.

14:37.341 --> 14:40.221
Oh, god.

14:48.581 --> 14:51.141
Thank you, Rose. We can manage.
Are you sure, ma'am?

14:51.381 --> 14:53.661
It's no bother...
That will be all. Thank you, Rose.

15:05.701 --> 15:06.861
Does James know?

15:09.381 --> 15:10.861
Olivia!

15:11.581 --> 15:14.581
You... you don't know
what it's been like.

15:14.901 --> 15:17.621
Please don't judge me...
How could you do such a thing?

15:17.941 --> 15:20.421
I did it for James.

15:24.021 --> 15:25.341
Our baby...

15:28.661 --> 15:30.341
Our baby didn't live.

15:30.661 --> 15:34.901
And... I couldn't tell him.

15:35.021 --> 15:38.741
The thought of being a father was
the only thing that saved him

15:38.821 --> 15:39.941
in that dreadful clinic.

15:40.181 --> 15:43.501
It was the only thing
that kept us together.

15:45.301 --> 15:48.301
Olivia, you must tell him.

15:48.461 --> 15:50.301
Anna, I can't.

15:50.661 --> 15:54.821
James adores baby Georgie and you.
He will forgive you.

15:54.941 --> 15:58.701
No, he won't. Nor will his father,
nor will his grandmother...

15:58.901 --> 16:00.381
Olivia!

16:00.621 --> 16:02.141
You need to tell them.

16:03.981 --> 16:05.621
You don't understand.

16:06.061 --> 16:10.021
You couldn't wait to free yourself
from the Bligh name but for James,

16:10.301 --> 16:12.701
it is the most important
thing in the world,

16:12.861 --> 16:14.581
and this would destroy it.

16:14.901 --> 16:16.181
I know I have committed

16:16.381 --> 16:17.701
a gross deception.

16:17.781 --> 16:19.301
Introducing a bastard child...

16:19.381 --> 16:20.341
Don't!

16:23.141 --> 16:25.941
Oh. Oh, Anna, I'm sorry. I...

16:29.341 --> 16:35.861
If you have any regard for me,
for your brother,

16:39.141 --> 16:42.261
I implore you, say nothing.

16:42.461 --> 16:44.381
You've seen how
happy Georgie makes him.

16:44.901 --> 16:49.701
Anna, don't put his health at risk.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.741
I don't know what else to say.

17:03.741 --> 17:07.221
If you could just find
it in your heart to forgive me.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.221
If you can't...

17:17.461 --> 17:19.060
James is at the stables.

17:22.887 --> 17:25.686
# Ride a cock-horse to Banbury Cross

17:25.926 --> 17:28.367
# To see a fine lady upon
a white horse

17:28.487 --> 17:31.287
# With rings on her fingers
and bells on her toes

17:31.647 --> 17:35.327
♪ She shall have music
wherever she goes. ♪

17:36.087 --> 17:37.847
What's that, Georgie?
It's the horsie.

17:38.087 --> 17:39.847
The horsie.
What does the horsie say?

17:40.047 --> 17:44.127
Horsie goes 'neigh'!
Look, it's Aunty Anna.

17:44.447 --> 17:46.247
Georgie says 'Dada' now.

17:46.447 --> 17:47.807
Don't you, little man?

17:48.687 --> 17:50.367
Livvie says he's blowing
bubbles, but Daddy

17:50.487 --> 17:53.247
knows better, doesn't he, Georgie?

17:53.447 --> 17:58.367
Can you say 'Dada'?
Da, da, da, da, da.

17:59.086 --> 18:01.166
Da, da, da, da, da...

18:16.646 --> 18:18.246
I didn't tell him.

18:22.566 --> 18:25.526
Thank you.
How do you do it?

18:25.846 --> 18:27.286
Keep such a secret?

18:30.446 --> 18:32.246
I honestly don't know.

18:32.326 --> 18:35.286
Do you even know who his mother is?

18:38.766 --> 18:39.966
I am.

18:41.186 --> 18:42.026
Anna.

18:42.146 --> 18:43.426
You won't...

18:45.226 --> 18:46.466
you won't tell Gino, will you?

19:11.426 --> 19:14.186
Did she leave alone?
She didn't take any staff with her?

19:14.386 --> 19:16.066
She's always alone, isn't she?

19:16.266 --> 19:18.066
That woman has no
friends whatsoever.

19:18.226 --> 19:19.826
Certainly no female ones.

19:23.346 --> 19:25.306
Have I put James at risk?

19:26.906 --> 19:30.426
Well, there's a chance of winning George's
affection, however slim, I don't think

19:30.666 --> 19:34.426
she'll play that card.
But tread carefully, Carolyn.

19:34.906 --> 19:36.386
You've stirred a rattlesnake.

19:37.706 --> 19:39.226
That ought to hold her.

19:39.306 --> 19:40.986
You should have a spare, but.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.106
Thanks, Roy.

19:42.306 --> 19:45.226
Mind you, a pair of the wife's best
stockings tied together'll

19:45.426 --> 19:46.746
do the trick in an emergency.

19:48.226 --> 19:49.986
I used to get Larry-Do
when I did that, though.

19:50.026 --> 19:51.826
Your wife would yell at you?

19:52.026 --> 19:53.066
Too right.

19:53.266 --> 19:54.766
But she knew who
was head of the house, right?

19:54.786 --> 19:57.386
Oh, yeah, and it weren't me.

19:58.906 --> 19:59.746
Really?

20:00.906 --> 20:04.066
Mate, when you get to my age, you learn
not to take things too seriously.

20:04.226 --> 20:08.586
Yeah. Anna, she doesn't understand.

20:08.826 --> 20:11.666
I want to make a good life
for her, and our family,

20:11.906 --> 20:13.026
God willing.

20:13.226 --> 20:14.186
Speak of the devil.

20:14.426 --> 20:16.066
Hi, Roy.
G'day, Miss Anna!

20:16.186 --> 20:18.186
It's lovely to see you.
Would you like to come in,

20:18.266 --> 20:20.505
have a cup of tea? Nah, I'd better get
a wriggle-on, thanks.

20:20.506 --> 20:21.946
I'll see youse directly.

20:22.146 --> 20:23.426
Thanks, Roy.

20:29.826 --> 20:30.786
Where were you today?

20:30.906 --> 20:32.946
You know where I was.
I was at the vines.

20:33.146 --> 20:34.306
After that?

20:36.226 --> 20:38.146
Anna.
I was at Ash Park.

20:38.266 --> 20:42.346
I went to see Olivia
and to see baby Georgie.

20:42.426 --> 20:43.906
What's wrong?

20:48.906 --> 20:50.826
Ah, bella.

20:50.946 --> 20:54.066
We'll have a baby
of our own one day,

20:54.146 --> 20:56.386
just like Olivia.

20:58.586 --> 21:00.546
Gino...

21:12.346 --> 21:14.146
You cannot be serious.

21:14.266 --> 21:16.066
Thanks, Bunny.
You're welcome, sir.

21:16.146 --> 21:17.906
You're a girl about town.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.786
You know what I'm talking about.

21:19.906 --> 21:22.466
Sexy young bohemians
doing sexy young things.

21:22.586 --> 21:25.186
But we discussed that
I was to do art pieces.

21:25.266 --> 21:27.106
This is a bloody art piece!

21:27.226 --> 21:29.946
I want to know what happens
in the bars and the alleyways

21:30.066 --> 21:34.706
after the exhibitions, not boring
waffle about the damn paintings.

21:34.826 --> 21:38.826
And give me the dirt on those
boozy openings of yours,

21:38.906 --> 21:41.866
without getting me sued, of course.

21:41.946 --> 21:43.506
And if I refuse?

21:44.786 --> 21:46.506
Our arrangement is terminated...

21:47.786 --> 21:50.466
which will make a certain
member of your family very happy.

21:52.706 --> 21:55.066
Regina.

21:55.146 --> 21:57.826
Ain't she something?

22:05.906 --> 22:07.346
Oh, hello.

22:07.426 --> 22:09.066
Is it Monday already?

22:09.186 --> 22:11.906
I'm not coming on Monday,
or any other day.

22:11.986 --> 22:13.906
And yet, here you are.

22:13.986 --> 22:15.986
Come in.

22:16.066 --> 22:18.346
Your behaviour is utt...

22:19.906 --> 22:22.146
James, what are you doing here?

22:22.266 --> 22:25.226
I'm having my sitting.
Now?

22:25.306 --> 22:27.146
Yes, now.

22:27.266 --> 22:30.306
I must have my days muddled...
Oh, join us, if you like.

22:30.426 --> 22:33.106
I normally only do one of you
at a time at this stage...

22:33.226 --> 22:36.506
No, no, I'll leave
the two of you to...

22:36.586 --> 22:38.706
Sorry to interrupt.

22:44.506 --> 22:47.866
So, James, how about a drink,
my good man?

22:52.306 --> 22:54.666
Oh, this'll work fine.

22:56.466 --> 22:58.066
No.

22:58.186 --> 23:01.106
I can turn that out there
into a bit of a sleep-out.

23:01.226 --> 23:05.266
So there's plenty of room, if
that's what you're worried about.

23:05.346 --> 23:07.786
Thanks, Roy.

23:07.866 --> 23:09.586
Still early days.

23:09.666 --> 23:11.506
Yeah, course.

23:19.186 --> 23:21.746
Well, that's enough of me rabbiting
on. I'll leave youse to it.

23:21.866 --> 23:25.546
You can just tell Jeeves to
turn out the lights. Goodnight.

23:25.626 --> 23:27.466
Goodnight.

23:33.946 --> 23:37.546
There's a new hospital,
the Prince of Wales.

23:37.626 --> 23:39.266
Word is, they're looking for nurses.

23:43.946 --> 23:45.866
Why don't we move?

23:47.706 --> 23:49.666
Start again, just the two of us.

23:52.666 --> 23:54.386
It's not like you to run.

23:55.986 --> 23:57.986
I'm not running.

23:58.066 --> 23:59.946
I'm trying to do what's best for us.

24:01.586 --> 24:04.426
Why add to the strain,
by living so close to...

24:08.506 --> 24:10.466
Say it.

24:10.546 --> 24:12.106
"To George."

24:12.186 --> 24:14.466
It's no strain.

24:14.546 --> 24:17.186
We both know I'm not well. My head.

24:17.306 --> 24:18.946
I could die...
Don't.

24:19.146 --> 24:22.146
Living here,
when I'm gone, you'll be cared for.

24:24.306 --> 24:26.986
Don't talk like that.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.666
Don't talk of death.

24:28.746 --> 24:30.666
This...

24:30.746 --> 24:32.826
this baby is life.

24:36.626 --> 24:39.106
Remember how much we wanted
a family?

24:53.306 --> 24:55.346
Rene, look at me.

24:59.626 --> 25:01.186
I'm having this child.

25:02.826 --> 25:07.666
But if you can't learn to love it,
then we have no future.

25:27.866 --> 25:30.346
Darling, I know
I mentioned this earlier but...

25:30.746 --> 25:32.466
the portrait.

25:32.586 --> 25:36.066
I really do think we should inquire
about another artist.

25:36.146 --> 25:37.066
Just admit it.

25:37.386 --> 25:39.706
Admit what?

25:42.666 --> 25:47.586
You don't trust me alone with him.
That is not true.

25:50.346 --> 25:52.746
Isn't it?
Of course not.

25:55.666 --> 25:58.146
Oh, come on. Why were you there?

25:59.626 --> 26:01.766
Because I don't believe
you forgot what day it was.

26:02.746 --> 26:05.026
A message for Lloyd, from Carolyn.

26:05.226 --> 26:06.986
Some party or other.
It wasn't important.

26:07.026 --> 26:10.026
Just stop lying.
Fine, then.

26:10.226 --> 26:14.066
I was thrown to see you there.

26:14.306 --> 26:15.906
You hadn't mentioned it.

26:15.966 --> 26:17.826
Why should I mention it?
It's a family portrait.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.786
Last time I checked, I'm
a member of this family!

26:19.986 --> 26:22.206
You are deliberately goading me.
It's better than being

26:22.346 --> 26:26.226
disingenuous.
You would know all about that!

26:26.346 --> 26:29.626
Are you accusing me of duplicity?
What am I supposed to think?

26:29.746 --> 26:31.446
I have worked so hard,
behaved beyond reproach!

26:31.466 --> 26:33.266
You've concealed things from me
in the past.

26:34.066 --> 26:35.626
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

26:38.266 --> 26:40.626
It always comes back to that,
doesn't it?

26:40.746 --> 26:43.146
No matter how much
you say it's behind us.

26:43.266 --> 26:45.266
You are the one who is
being defensive, James.

26:45.666 --> 26:47.006
Because you're stalking around

26:47.026 --> 26:49.306
in the bushes, spying on me!
Now you're being ridiculous!

26:49.466 --> 26:53.186
Do you know how embarrassed I was?
How humiliated?

26:53.306 --> 26:55.866
Don't speak to me
about humiliation!

26:55.986 --> 27:01.386
Humiliation is having a husband
who can't stand to touch me!

27:01.466 --> 27:03.666
James, wait.

27:03.746 --> 27:05.066
Don't leave. James!

27:06.186 --> 27:07.346
James!

27:09.386 --> 27:11.186
Take him to the nursery.

27:51.979 --> 27:53.579
Yes.

27:55.053 --> 27:58.613
I thought you might like a cup.
I let it steep for a good while.

27:58.854 --> 28:00.814
How's Georgie?

28:01.133 --> 28:03.733
Still asleep.

28:04.534 --> 28:07.254
He's been grizzling on and off.

28:07.494 --> 28:09.214
I think he might be teething.

28:09.294 --> 28:11.334
I'll keep an eye on him, Miss.

28:11.454 --> 28:15.334
I don't mind. He's such an angel,
even when he's cheeky.

28:15.414 --> 28:17.494
You do so much already.

28:17.574 --> 28:19.454
It's no bother, really.

28:19.574 --> 28:21.774
I'll be downstairs
if you need anything.

28:28.494 --> 28:30.734
May I?
Darling, of course.

28:43.734 --> 28:45.734
I'm so sorry.

28:53.654 --> 28:56.294
So am I.

28:56.597 --> 28:58.207
James...

29:08.962 --> 29:11.602
It's not true.

29:11.682 --> 29:13.602
That I can't stand to touch you.

29:24.642 --> 29:26.442
Not like this.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.842
You wanted to see me?

29:55.282 --> 29:57.242
It's from Nancy Brent.

29:57.602 --> 29:59.322
She thanks us for all we did.

29:59.562 --> 30:02.362
It meant a lot to her that you were
with Linda at the end.

30:08.042 --> 30:09.802
Give me his address.

30:11.642 --> 30:13.582
I've got nothing on today
that can't be moved.

30:15.722 --> 30:17.642
Promise me you'll
let the police handle it.

30:17.762 --> 30:20.002
I will.
And don't use your name.

30:20.282 --> 30:22.122
I'm not stupid.

30:23.882 --> 30:26.882
Sarah, I need to see this
bastard is taken off the streets.

30:31.882 --> 30:33.842
I'll cancel both our appointments.

30:33.962 --> 30:37.362
No, it's too dangerous.
Jack, I know the address.

30:38.882 --> 30:41.282
And I'm the only one
who can identify him.

30:44.322 --> 30:45.922
You were right.

30:46.002 --> 30:47.962
Lunch is a much better idea.

30:48.082 --> 30:50.802
I don't know what I was thinking,
inviting you out to dinner.

30:57.562 --> 30:59.402
Oh, I see there are a number of

30:59.522 --> 31:02.322
new additions to the menu
since I last dined here.

31:02.442 --> 31:06.562
One should always be
up for new experiences.

31:09.722 --> 31:12.522
Too early for champagne, hm?

31:12.602 --> 31:14.162
Oh, tea will suffice.

31:14.242 --> 31:16.642
Hm. A few minutes more.

31:16.722 --> 31:18.242
And some tea, in the meantime.

31:20.362 --> 31:22.802
And a bottle of your '36 Pommery.
Two glasses.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.322
Certainly, sir.

31:34.322 --> 31:37.082
Ah, excuse me, ma'am.
You can't go in there.

31:37.162 --> 31:39.282
Sorry, sir, she...

31:42.362 --> 31:45.402
You're late.
You needn't bother firing me.

31:45.482 --> 31:47.042
I know the outcome.

31:57.362 --> 31:58.762
Alice was her name.

32:01.482 --> 32:03.442
How long ago did she die?

32:05.202 --> 32:09.522
October 28, 1921.

32:09.602 --> 32:12.042
Same day my son, Frank, was born.

32:12.162 --> 32:15.122
Same time.
Hm.

32:16.762 --> 32:19.522
Raising a child
alone is no easy task.

32:21.962 --> 32:25.002
Shames me to say,
I was never very close to the boy.

32:26.762 --> 32:30.482
I...I blamed him
for his mother's death.

32:30.562 --> 32:32.722
To be honest,

32:32.802 --> 32:35.202
I all but abandoned him.

32:36.842 --> 32:39.922
Well, children can
be very forgiving.

32:40.002 --> 32:42.122
It's never too late, surely.

32:46.162 --> 32:48.122
Frank died in Borneo.

32:49.882 --> 32:51.562
A week later, the Japs surrendered.

32:57.962 --> 33:01.002
I never realised
what he meant to me.

33:07.362 --> 33:11.162
Perhaps that's why you were
moved to open the refuge.

33:11.242 --> 33:14.762
You see your late son in the men.

33:14.842 --> 33:17.202
I reckon there's something in that.

33:20.162 --> 33:22.762
Police! Open up!

33:26.202 --> 33:27.722
There's no-one there!

33:27.802 --> 33:29.962
Been empty for years!

33:30.082 --> 33:33.642
Thanks, love.
Must have the wrong place.

33:33.722 --> 33:35.522
This is the house.

33:35.602 --> 33:37.282
Why don't you break the door down?

33:37.402 --> 33:39.962
Why don't you stop
wasting our time?

33:42.082 --> 33:45.002
This is the right address,
I'm sure of it.

33:45.082 --> 33:46.522
They're in his pocket.

34:08.641 --> 34:09.922
Hey, come here!

34:10.042 --> 34:11.601
You're not goin' anywhere.
Let me go!

34:11.842 --> 34:14.601
Is this the guy?
It's him.

34:17.842 --> 34:20.522
He's down here!
You bastard, that's assault!

34:22.242 --> 34:23.681
Arrest him!

34:23.762 --> 34:25.202
Oh, let me go!

34:28.042 --> 34:30.762
The police are
refusing to arrest this man!

34:30.882 --> 34:34.121
He's been performing
abortions and women have died!

34:34.202 --> 34:35.681
I know you.

34:35.762 --> 34:38.002
Alright, clear off!

34:38.601 --> 34:41.081
I haven't done anything!
I have to cuff you, Don.

34:41.442 --> 34:42.681
Let me go!

34:42.842 --> 34:44.322
OK, settle down. Calm down.

34:44.522 --> 34:46.282
I haven't done anything!

34:50.161 --> 34:52.601
See you in court!

34:57.682 --> 35:01.882
I spent most of my life
trying to control my children.

35:01.962 --> 35:03.842
I didn't want them to grow up.

35:05.482 --> 35:08.482
But I put order
and discipline first.

35:10.122 --> 35:14.802
Carolyn essentially severed
all contact with me for years.

35:15.362 --> 35:20.962
George has displayed a surprising
capacity for tolerance but,

35:22.802 --> 35:26.442
I've, um... I've hurt him terribly.

35:26.522 --> 35:29.482
Is that why you're at the refuge?

35:29.562 --> 35:31.002
Doing penance?

35:32.842 --> 35:35.002
Perhaps.

35:36.562 --> 35:38.162
Oh, dear, aren't I a cheery
companion?

35:45.162 --> 35:46.842
You're a fascinating woman,
Elizabeth.

35:50.122 --> 35:52.842
Please don't presume to know me.

35:55.802 --> 35:57.682
Will you consider
the piano a donation?

36:00.522 --> 36:02.642
I must go.

36:02.802 --> 36:04.722
Thank you for lunch, Mr Goddard.

36:18.842 --> 36:21.482
Goodness me. A house call.

36:21.602 --> 36:25.802
Spontaneous appointments,
the latest in modern medicine.

36:25.882 --> 36:28.122
How terribly unconventional of you.

36:30.602 --> 36:32.282
How is my Lois Lane?

36:32.402 --> 36:35.522
Oh, you'll be pleased to know
that I've just handed in my first

36:35.602 --> 36:37.042
and last piece to Sir Richard.

36:37.162 --> 36:40.122
It won't see the light of day,
but it was immensely satisfying

36:40.202 --> 36:42.002
nonetheless.

36:42.082 --> 36:44.562
Best explained over a cocktail.

36:44.682 --> 36:48.242
So, does this mean
I'll be seeing more of you?

36:48.322 --> 36:50.002
You'll be sick to death of me

36:50.122 --> 36:52.162
before the week is out.
Never.

36:54.842 --> 36:57.682
I'll make sure you're
too busy to miss the city.

36:59.682 --> 37:01.762
She's gone out for lunch.

37:17.802 --> 37:21.042
You're back!
So it would appear.

37:21.122 --> 37:23.642
Hello, Elizabeth.

37:23.722 --> 37:26.762
Hello. What brings you to the city?

37:26.882 --> 37:28.962
Uh, a seminar.
Everything alright?

37:29.042 --> 37:31.122
Oh, just a slight headache.

37:31.202 --> 37:32.482
If you'll excuse me.

37:32.682 --> 37:35.442
Of course.

37:42.082 --> 37:43.082
Cup of tea?

38:18.402 --> 38:20.082
Forgive me, Papa.

38:32.482 --> 38:35.362
Good day, George? Oh, it's just fine.
Thank you, Gino.

38:35.442 --> 38:37.362
I appreciate this.

38:37.602 --> 38:39.882
Good to see you, Gino.

38:43.802 --> 38:45.682
James.

38:45.802 --> 38:48.002
Darling.
Reggie.

38:51.442 --> 38:52.202
Regina.

38:53.362 --> 38:58.122
I...I won't intrude, but if I may
make a suggestion? Remove the tie.

39:03.322 --> 39:04.882
Hate to say it.

39:10.362 --> 39:12.002
Yeah, she's quite a turnout.

39:13.482 --> 39:16.282
Old Doris. When she does something,
she does it right.

39:17.962 --> 39:21.362
You can wait in the truck if you
like, if you feel more comfortable.

39:34.922 --> 39:35.922
Hello?

40:11.082 --> 40:15.082
See? You are beautiful.

40:21.082 --> 40:22.842
There's so many.

40:23.202 --> 40:29.282
Yes. I, uh...
I got a little carried away.

40:36.122 --> 40:39.642
What is this?
Oh, it's you.

40:42.602 --> 40:46.242
I would never pose like that.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.402
Wouldn't you?

41:33.962 --> 41:35.962
You have bewitched me.

42:44.515 --> 42:46.155
As some of you may be aware,

42:46.499 --> 42:50.099
I hope to represent the Country
Party in the upcoming election.

42:52.819 --> 42:55.779
Now, my family has lived
on this land

42:55.827 --> 42:57.187
for generations

42:57.427 --> 43:01.078
and the soil is as familiar to me
as... as my own sweat.

43:01.078 --> 43:03.078
Not very familiar, then, eh?

43:03.958 --> 43:05.518
You are right to be sceptical.

43:05.758 --> 43:09.438
I...I was fortunate
to be born into wealth.

43:09.679 --> 43:11.279
Tutto bene?
Why not share it round?

43:11.359 --> 43:13.119
I intend to.

43:13.359 --> 43:14.559
But let's start with improving

43:14.606 --> 43:17.046
the infrastructure in
this district. Those roads.

43:17.366 --> 43:19.576
They're impassable after the rain.

43:19.576 --> 43:22.496
It makes it impossible for any of
us to get our stock to the markets.

43:24.256 --> 43:26.776
If I'm to be your
representative,

43:27.136 --> 43:30.896
I will bring Inverness into the modern era
with the introduction of the latest

43:31.096 --> 43:33.136
farming methods.

43:33.456 --> 43:35.376
So, I want to facilitate

43:35.656 --> 43:39.976
a farm bank where we combine
our resources

43:40.096 --> 43:43.616
to purchase the latest farming
equipment and we share

43:43.816 --> 43:45.856
in their upkeep and use.

43:47.136 --> 43:48.696
Well done.

43:49.696 --> 43:52.096
And the loss of our young men
to the city in search of work -

43:52.336 --> 43:54.216
this has to be stemmed.

43:54.856 --> 43:59.336
And it can be stemmed, with
the creation of local factories.

43:59.856 --> 44:01.736
Now, some of you may have heard

44:01.976 --> 44:07.576
of the Fletcher Jones model, where
workers own shares in the company.

44:08.216 --> 44:11.136
Therefore, they directly benefit
from the company's success.

44:11.896 --> 44:16.936
Now, why can't we have one of those
here for the future of our own sons
and daughters?

44:20.376 --> 44:22.416
If I win this pre-selection...

44:39.176 --> 44:40.456
What was I thinking?

44:40.696 --> 44:42.656
What?

44:47.856 --> 44:49.976
James will be back any minute.

44:50.296 --> 44:52.136
It's alright.

44:53.736 --> 44:55.816
It is not alright.

44:55.896 --> 44:57.776
It's fine.

44:57.896 --> 45:02.296
Nothing about this is
remotely alright, or fine.

45:02.376 --> 45:04.696
Oh!

45:04.776 --> 45:06.376
Where are my shoes?

45:06.456 --> 45:08.776
Come here, alright?

45:14.136 --> 45:15.896
Lloyd, this is...

45:18.616 --> 45:19.736
What have I done?

45:24.136 --> 45:25.896
Where is my damned shoe?

45:26.016 --> 45:27.976
They're probably
where you threw 'em.

45:41.176 --> 45:44.316
Now, admit it, Carolyn. You're disappointed
your journalistic career's at an end.

45:44.336 --> 45:46.216
Would have been nice to
see the views of a woman

45:46.296 --> 45:49.656
validated in print, for once.

45:49.776 --> 45:53.376
I really don't want to talk
about it. How was lunch?

45:55.016 --> 45:57.136
I really don't want to
talk about that, either.

46:07.816 --> 46:10.616
Well, I might go for a walk.

46:10.736 --> 46:13.056
Need anything?
Ah, 'The Chronicle',

46:13.216 --> 46:15.456
if you're passing one.

46:27.376 --> 46:28.536
You're upset.

46:37.576 --> 46:39.016
You like him, don't you?

46:39.136 --> 46:43.016
It's neither here nor there,
since our acquaintance is at an end.

46:44.976 --> 46:48.496
You don't have to
repeat history, you know.

46:48.576 --> 46:52.816
You do have choices. We all do.

46:52.896 --> 46:55.176
Carolyn, please don't patronise me.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.456
Whisky?

47:02.136 --> 47:03.176
Hmm.

47:46.616 --> 47:52.176
I'll try to be him again.
The man I was.

47:54.936 --> 47:56.616
I see you, my love.

48:00.416 --> 48:01.536
I do.

49:19.776 --> 49:20.976
I don't believe it.

49:23.456 --> 49:25.496
He's published it!

50:08.576 --> 50:11.416
"'Beware the Friendless Female',
by Carolyn Bligh.

50:12.176 --> 50:15.656
"We've all met them, those carefully
painted women who seem to care.

50:15.936 --> 50:21.376
"But, ladies, look closely.
Does she have any female friends?

50:21.656 --> 50:23.136
"I mean, real girlfriends,

50:23.416 --> 50:27.136
"the ones who take you out for a night on
the tiles when he breaks your heart?

50:27.416 --> 50:30.616
"Dig a little, and you'll find
she's completely alone.

50:30.776 --> 50:32.416
"Not a female friend in sight.

50:32.656 --> 50:37.296
"Because behind that eyeshadow
lies a calculating mind,

50:37.416 --> 50:42.456
"obsessed with only one thing -
getting that chap at any cost.

50:42.576 --> 50:45.016
"And don't think
she'll stop at just the man.

50:45.136 --> 50:50.656
"There's the family estate,
his cars, his horses, his staff.

50:50.736 --> 50:52.496
She's insatiable, ladies."
