Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:02.900 --> 00:03.900
Adrian's here.

00:03.900 --> 00:06.700
- It is her fault.
- It isn't anyone's fault.

00:06.700 --> 00:13.100
Grace killed him, but she is
the one who made sex look like fun.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.000
- We're gonna have a baby.
- Yep.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.200
Now Dad is dead.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.300
And he had a horrible death
because I had incredible sex.

00:19.300 --> 00:20.100
I can't take it.

00:20.100 --> 00:22.300
I can't think about anything
other than having sex with Amy.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.700
So you are a man.

00:23.800 --> 00:24.900
I got you this.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.700
It's beautiful!

00:27.700 --> 00:29.700
Thank you for everything today, George.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.700
I can't take another visitor.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.300
Hi, Anne.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.000
I saw the way that
you were touching her.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.200
It hasn't been 24 hours. You love her.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.300
I don't even know
that woman, that Betty.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.600
And she looks like a hooker.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.400
Yeah, well, I might be
getting a hooker soon

00:43.400 --> 00:44.900
if we don't have some sort of contact.

00:44.900 --> 00:47.700
Believe me, Ben, I will not be having
sex for a very, very long time.

00:47.700 --> 00:49.500
I was wondering
what you would think

00:49.500 --> 00:52.800
if I asked your mother if
the three of us got a house together.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.100
R-Really? We could move to a house?

00:55.100 --> 00:58.100
I don't want you to love me,
and I don't love you anymore.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.500
What are you doing here?

01:07.500 --> 01:08.800
Your mom asked me to come.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.500
She wanted me to try to talk to Grace.

01:11.900 --> 01:12.900
How you doing, buddy?

01:12.900 --> 01:15.200
Buddy? We're not buddies.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.400
Not anymore.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.000
Come on, Tom.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
If Tammy wanted to have sex,
wouldn't you have sex?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.500
After this? Are you kidding me?

01:21.800 --> 01:23.800
I'm down to my last parent.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.900
Well, there must be something
I can do for you today.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
It's gonna be a tough day.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.400
Yeah, but we'll get through with it
without your help.

01:32.400 --> 01:36.200
We'll all get through
with it without your help.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.500
I am the man of this house.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.900
I know that, but still,
can't I do something?

01:41.200 --> 01:43.100
I have to, Tom. I have to do something.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.400
I'm going crazy.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.300
I need to help do something.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.900
Can you bring back my dad?

01:51.300 --> 01:53.200
- I'm just gonna go see if--
- Go ahead.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.000
Hey, Grace.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.900
I just wanted to see
if you were okay this morning.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.100
Stop. Just don't touch
anything on this bed, okay?

02:11.100 --> 02:12.200
Okay, Grace.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.900
- Grace--
- There's nothing you can do for me.

02:15.900 --> 02:16.900
Okay? Nothing.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.200
Yeah, well, there's
something you can do for me.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.000
Talk to me, please.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.200
I just can't believe I let you
talk me into having sex with you.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.000
I thought it was a mutual decision.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.200
A mutual decision made out of love
and respect for each other.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.300
- Well, it wasn't.
- I guess it wasn't.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.200
But I was willing to wait.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.900
You were the one
pushing for sex, Grace.

02:34.900 --> 02:35.900
I would never have had sex

02:35.900 --> 02:38.200
if you hadn't been having sex
with every other girl in the school.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.500
I had to do it. I had to.

02:41.300 --> 02:42.900
??Just get away from me.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.400
I was just trying to hug you, Grace.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.200
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry we had sex,
but we didn't kill your father.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.800
Yes, we did.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.600
Grace, I love you.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.700
Not enough to say no.
No to me, no to every other girl.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.800
Okay, it's my fault.
Everything's my fault.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.200
It is your fault.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.400
- I'll see you at the church.
- No, you won't.

03:00.400 --> 03:04.500
- At the funeral, at the church.
- I'm not going. I can't.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.700
I can't just go there and face
all the people at the church,

03:08.200 --> 03:11.400
face all my dad's friends
and his patients. I can't.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.500
I can't go there and face my father.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.900
Stop. I hate you.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.900
I just hate-- I hate me.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.600
Mom, I can't find my paper--
my history paper.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.600
I put it inside my book.

04:02.900 --> 04:03.700
What?

04:03.900 --> 04:05.600
What? Good morning.

04:06.000 --> 04:06.900
I thought I'd come by to see

04:06.900 --> 04:09.300
if I could take John to
the nursery for you this morning.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.500
- You don't have a car seat.
- I do have a car seat.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.900
Same one you have in your mom's car.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.100
Still, you don't know
how to drop him off.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.399
You have to go in with him and hold him,

04:17.399 --> 04:19.300
and walk him around the place
until he's used to it,

04:19.300 --> 04:20.600
and then you have to put him in the bed.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.200
- You don't know which bed.
- I bet someone could tell me.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.400
Come on.

04:24.700 --> 04:27.100
I'll take him, and you can take
your time getting ready for school.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.000
I don't know.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.300
Good morning, Ricky. Thank you, Ricky.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.700
Hey, John. Say hi to Ricky.
Here's your daddy.

04:35.700 --> 04:38.400
Hey, there, little fella. Good morning.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.100
I don't know if I want him to take him.

04:40.100 --> 04:43.100
Amy, we're running late. It would
be really great if Ricky took him.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.300
I can take him.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.100
He'll be fine.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.500
I'll see you at school.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.900
I'll give you a minute-by-minute
report. Promise.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.300
I don't like surprises.
Call first next time.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.300
He did.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.400
Bye. See you at school.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.900
We're still gonna go by the nursery
to make sure John's okay, right?

05:02.900 --> 05:04.000
No, we're not.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.200
I'm gonna let your dad take
you to school, you and Ashley.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.200
I have to get to work early to set up
for a very important meeting

05:09.200 --> 05:10.600
before my doctor's appointment.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.900
The meeting's after, but I want
to make sure nothing goes wrong.

05:12.900 --> 05:15.000
You called him? You called Ricky?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.900
No, he called while
you were in the shower.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
He can't come by this afternoon because
he's going to Dr. Bowman's funeral.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.600
I forgot to tell them
I have to have today off.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.000
Yesterday was terrible.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.400
Everyone I worked with
was so shocked and so upset.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.300
Everyone at that church is.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.700
I think that the ladies
that you work with

05:30.700 --> 05:33.100
are counting on you to
cover for them this afternoon.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.000
But I want to go to the funeral.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.900
Who's gonna watch the children, Amy?

05:36.900 --> 05:38.700
Who's gonna watch John
and the other children

05:38.700 --> 05:40.400
if you and all the adults
are at the funeral?

05:40.400 --> 05:42.800
They'll have other people
to cover, I would think.

05:42.900 --> 05:46.000
They can't just take off every time
someone at that church passes away.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.800
I'm sure they have a backup plan.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.500
Amy, you are so lucky to have this job.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.500
You have to be there for them today.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.500
You be a part of that backup plan.
Be grateful. Make a contribution.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.600
Everyone at school
is going to that funeral.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.600
You can't.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.300
You gotta get ready for school.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.300
Good morning.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.200
It was nice kissing you last night.
I dreamed about it.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.400
Lucky you.

06:21.700 --> 06:22.500
Lucky me?

06:22.500 --> 06:24.200
Yeah, I wish I had time to dream.

06:24.700 --> 06:27.000
Hey, are you going to the funeral?
To Dr. Bowman's funeral?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.700
No. Unfortunately, I will be working.

06:29.800 --> 06:30.700
Ricky's going.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.800
I guess the two of you worked that out?

06:32.800 --> 06:34.800
- Yes, we did.
- Everyone else is going.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.300
All of our friends will be going.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.900
It's not the prom.
We're not missing the prom.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.000
We're missing a funeral.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.200
And we're new parents.
We can't do everything.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.000
Hey, Dad said we need to leave.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.200
Get dressed.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.400
I'll see you at school.

06:47.700 --> 06:48.600
Uh, love--

06:50.000 --> 06:50.900
...you.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.700
You look like hell.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.800
Yeah, I know.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.300
I'm kind of getting used to it.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.800
- But you look pretty.
- What do you want?

07:00.900 --> 07:03.200
I don't want anything.
I'm just saying you look pretty.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.000
- What do you want?
- I was just wondering--

07:05.000 --> 07:05.600
No.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.900
...if you wanted to help out
at the nursery today?

07:07.900 --> 07:09.800
- Instead of you?
- I want to go to the funeral.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.100
- You can't.
- I can if you help me out.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.500
I can't. I don't have a work permit
and I don't like children.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.300
If you volunteer
and you don't get paid,

07:16.300 --> 07:18.200
you could just take my place
for this afternoon.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.200
- I'm sure they won't mind.
- The children would mind.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.600
- Please?
- No, Amy.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.300
This is your job and it's your baby.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.400
Are you going to the funeral?

07:24.400 --> 07:26.100
No. Why would I go to the funeral?

07:26.100 --> 07:28.700
I don't know Dr. Bowman.
You know what? You don't, either.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.800
I still have to go to pay my respects,

07:30.800 --> 07:33.000
and especially after
everything Grace has done for me.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.200
You just want to go because
you think everyone else is going.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.100
Well, they are.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.000
Well, you can't,
because you're working.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.600
I'm tired of working.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.300
I wanna go out.

07:41.300 --> 07:42.900
- To a funeral?
- Anywhere.

07:42.900 --> 07:45.500
Anywhere but to work
and to school and to here.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.500
Never mind.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.400
You wouldn't understand.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.000
You're wearing your robe.

07:55.500 --> 07:56.300
Where's Amy?

07:56.600 --> 07:57.900
She's still getting ready.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.600
- Where's your mom?
- Still getting ready.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.000
These guys can't do anything
without us. ??Look at this place.

08:03.000 --> 08:03.900
Yeah, I know.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.600
Hey, see if you can steal the can opener.
I haven't been able to pick one up yet.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.200
- They'll never miss it.
- Why do we need one?

08:08.200 --> 08:09.700
If we had a can opener, I'd cook.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.800
Yeah, but it would be
something out of a can.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.200
What are you doing?

08:18.200 --> 08:20.300
I'm stealing the can opener
so Dad'll cook.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.600
We have more than one.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.600
You don't have to steal anything.
You can just ask.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.600
- Okay, I'm asking.
- Take it.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.300
I need to talk to your dad anyway.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.700
I'll be in the car.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.400
Stealing's wrong.

08:32.700 --> 08:33.600
How you feeling?

08:33.799 --> 08:34.799
Pregnant.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.799
I still can't believe I'm having a baby.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.000
I can't believe it.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.100
You know, George,
we still haven't filed for divorce.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.900
Give me the papers.
I'd be happy to sign.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.700
- Getting married again?
- I guess.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.200
You guess? Your new boyfriend
doesn't want to get married?

08:48.200 --> 08:50.600
Yeah, he wants to get married,
but it's because I'm having a baby,

08:50.600 --> 08:52.100
and it's not a good feeling.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.200
I doubt we'd even be talking about this
if it wasn't for what happened,

08:55.200 --> 08:56.900
but it happened, so...

08:56.900 --> 08:57.800
So.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.500
So, we need to get the divorce going.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.100
Where'd we leave it?

09:00.100 --> 09:02.800
We left it with my attorney was
going to send you the papers

09:02.800 --> 09:03.800
as soon as I looked at them,

09:03.800 --> 09:07.200
but I haven't had a chance to look
at them since the baby was born.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.500
So basically, I asked for the house

09:09.500 --> 09:10.700
because I figured
I was going to

09:10.700 --> 09:13.600
be taking care of Amy
and Ashley and the baby,

09:13.800 --> 09:17.100
and I asked for everything
in the house and my car.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.700
- What else?
- Are you okay with that?

09:18.700 --> 09:21.500
I got my own place, and it's kind
of like we bought a second home,

09:21.500 --> 09:23.000
and we've had this place 15 years,

09:23.000 --> 09:24.200
so the payment is practically nothing,

09:24.200 --> 09:27.000
and frankly, I figured
I owed you the house.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.600
You gave me 15 years of your life,
two beautiful children,

09:29.800 --> 09:31.600
and I chose to go outside
the marriage for sex,

09:31.600 --> 09:33.700
so that's the penalty, I'll live with it.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.000
Okay, thanks.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.400
But you had to have
some money to buy that house.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.900
Yeah. I took it out of the store.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.700
Is there any more money in the store?

09:43.700 --> 09:44.700
Money that you could share?

09:44.700 --> 09:47.100
No. You're getting the house, Anne.
What more do you want?

09:47.100 --> 09:48.700
Your boyfriend
comes from money, you know.

09:48.700 --> 09:51.500
No, I don't know.
I haven't met his family.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.800
Besides, his money has
nothing to do with our money,

09:53.800 --> 09:55.400
and it is our money.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.600
Not your money to
dole out as you please.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.500
You get the house and I get
the store, and we split the kids.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.100
You take care of Amy
and I take care of Ashley.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.600
That's completely fair,
right down the middle.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.000
Are you taking care of Ashley?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.600
Because she was over there
the other night by herself

10:05.600 --> 10:07.400
while you were over
at Kathleen's house.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.600
It's not like I was out on a date.
I had to go over and help Kathleen.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.900
She's got no one else to help her.

10:10.900 --> 10:13.100
And yes, I'm taking care of Ashley.
Are you taking care of Amy?

10:13.600 --> 10:17.200
What? Where is she, anyway?
Somewhere getting pregnant again?

10:25.600 --> 10:27.600
Should we go to the funeral
if Ben's not going?

10:27.700 --> 10:29.000
The whole school is going.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.300
Yeah, it looks that way,
but why is the whole school going?

10:31.600 --> 10:32.700
Grace is very popular.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.400
Yeah, but it's not like
it's a party or something.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.600
I don't think people should
just show up to a funeral.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.800
I thought you wanted to go.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.500
I do, but we're her friends.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.500
I don't think everybody
else should be going.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.200
I don't know if she'd consider us friends.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.300
Yeah, I don't, either.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.700
Are you going to the funeral?

10:48.300 --> 10:50.400
Is everyone going to the funeral?

10:50.500 --> 10:51.800
Are you going to the funeral?

10:51.800 --> 10:53.000
I'm not sure.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.100
I'm not even sure
Grace is going to the funeral.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.000
Her mother said
she won't come out of her room.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.300
- She has to go.
- No, she doesn't.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.900
- She's too distraught.
- Money says she goes.

11:02.900 --> 11:03.600
What did you say?

11:03.600 --> 11:06.500
Well, some people think she's
going to be the next Miss Havisham--

11:06.500 --> 11:08.800
she's going to lock herself
in her room for the rest of her life.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.700
But others feel she's
going to emerge for the service.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.700
It's a very sad but even bet.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.500
You are disgusting.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.800
You are all disgusting.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.100
Jack. Jack, hey.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.400
Hey, how are you?

11:23.700 --> 11:24.500
Not good.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.000
I was over there this morning.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.300
She hates me.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.900
And now I hate me.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.100
And you know what? I hate you, too.

11:35.100 --> 11:36.100
You started all this.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.800
- I didn't do anything.
- Don't act so innocent.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.900
If you and I hadn't hooked up
the first of the school year,

11:40.900 --> 11:43.300
I wouldn't have been pursuing
every girl that would have sex with me

11:43.300 --> 11:43.900
the rest of the year.

11:43.900 --> 11:45.500
I think you were
the one who called me.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.400
So? You don't know how
to say no? You don't, do you?

11:48.500 --> 11:51.100
You're okay having sex with
any guy who'll have sex.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.900
Hey, you two, what's going on?

11:56.600 --> 11:58.400
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.200
Somehow, I killed Grace's dad.
It's all my fault.

12:01.600 --> 12:06.100
Because I like sex, I'm responsible for
Dr. Bowman dying in a plane crash.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.100
That's ridiculous.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.900
- It is, isn't it?
- Yes, of course it is.

12:08.900 --> 12:11.500
It was an accident.
It had nothing to do with anything.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.500
Other than mechanical failure.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.300
It's not your fault.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.700
It's not anyone's fault.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.300
- Feeling better?
- Why do you ask?

12:24.900 --> 12:27.700
Adrian was-- She was just having
a hard time, and I was comforting her.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.800
You know, as a friend.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.900
Thanks, Ben.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.300
Bye, Amy.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.500
If you're thinking that
you're going to sleep with her

12:36.500 --> 12:37.900
because I won't sleep with you,

12:38.000 --> 12:39.600
you've got another thought
coming, Ben Boykewich.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.500
I'm not thinking about
sleeping with anyone.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.000
- Are you?
- What?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.600
Your shoes. Your bedroom slippers?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.400
Oh, great.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.800
Still, you'd better not
be flirting with Adrian

12:51.800 --> 12:53.200
because you're not getting sex from me.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.700
I'm not flirting with anyone, Amy.

12:54.700 --> 12:58.400
Jeez. You're starting to
get a little insecure.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.200
No, I'm not.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.900
I love you. I really love you.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.000
And we're going to be together
for the rest of our lives.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.500
So, whenever we have sex,

13:05.500 --> 13:09.500
whether it's next year
or five years from now

13:09.500 --> 13:10.500
or ten years from now,

13:10.500 --> 13:12.400
whenever, I'll be fine.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.100
Who are you trying
to convince? Me or you?

13:15.900 --> 13:19.400
All I can tell you is
it isn't going to be this year.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.200
by "this year," do you mean
school year or calendar year?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.400
So, you're going to the funeral?

13:28.100 --> 13:29.100
Everyone's going.

13:29.900 --> 13:33.000
Yeah. I decided that
I could get through it.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.400
There's going to be
so many people there.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.000
You hardly even know Grace.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.200
You didn't know her dad at all.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.800
So? It's like you said,

13:38.800 --> 13:41.100
Grace has been
very good to you this year.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.000
I think we should go to support her.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.400
She's having a really hard time.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.700
Well, of course she is.

13:45.700 --> 13:49.000
We heard that she thinks she killed
her own father by having sex.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
- Not just any sex. Great sex.
- I know. She told me that.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.300
And you didn't tell us?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.200
Why do you never tell us anything?

13:56.200 --> 13:58.200
- So, it is true.
- Yes, it's true.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.100
She told me that
when I went over to her house.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.300
I went over to her house
because I'm her friend.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.800
- You're not her friends.
- Yes, we are.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.800
We are as much as anyone else.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.000
Is the whole school going?

14:08.700 --> 14:09.700
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.400
Do you think Grace is going
to go to the funeral?

14:12.400 --> 14:14.700
Yes, I think Grace is going
to go to the funeral.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.600
- Don't you?
- Joe's taking bets.

14:16.700 --> 14:17.300
What?

14:17.300 --> 14:20.500
On whether or not Grace will come
out of her room and go to the services.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.600
So, people are going just to see
if Grace pulls herself together?

14:26.900 --> 14:28.700
What's going on?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.900
Apparently, the entire school
wants to find out

14:30.900 --> 14:32.700
if Grace is going to the funeral or not.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.600
Did you start some rumor that
Grace isn't going to the funeral?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.300
I think I should be there.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.100
In case she needs someone. A friend.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.000
- You're not that close.
- Yes, we are.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.200
Okay, we're not. Still.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.900
How'd it go at the nursery?
How'd John do?

14:49.900 --> 14:51.700
You make way too big
a deal out of everything.

14:51.700 --> 14:52.700
John was fine.

14:53.700 --> 14:55.100
It's a nice place, the church nursery.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.100
Yeah. You don't have to
spend too much time there.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.500
It's nicer than a butcher shop.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.000
What? Are you complaining?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.800
No, I'm not complaining.
I like working at the butcher shop.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.200
I was just saying that
the nursery's nice, that's all.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.700
What are you in
such a bad mood about?

15:08.300 --> 15:10.200
And why are you
wearing bedroom slippers?

15:10.200 --> 15:13.500
Because I just had your baby and,
hello, I'm a little exhausted.

15:13.500 --> 15:14.600
I know that.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.400
That's why I was trying
to help you out this morning.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.700
I mean, I'd be happy to
take John every morning.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.500
I don't want you to take him.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.600
I'm fine taking him.
I can handle him all by myself.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.800
Hey! He's my son, too, you know.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.700
Problems in Daddy-land?

15:30.300 --> 15:32.400
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.800
So, are we going to the funeral together?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.400
- I've never been to one.
- I've never been to one, either.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.300
- So?
- So, I don't know, Adrian.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.500
Maybe it's not appropriate.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.600
Maybe we'd just look like
we're on a date or something.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.300
Or like we're a couple or something?

15:45.600 --> 15:46.300
Yeah.

15:46.300 --> 15:49.400
We're not enough of a couple
to go to a funeral together?

15:49.400 --> 15:50.800
No, I don't think so.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.700
- What was that for?
- I just feel like slapping people today.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.200
- What was that for?
- The hug.

16:03.700 --> 16:04.700
What hug?

16:05.200 --> 16:06.800
She was upset. I hugged her.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.500
Just don't have sex with her.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.300
If you have sex with Adrian,
someone really will die.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.900
Because I wouldn't like that. At all.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.300
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.200
Oh, that's okay.

16:30.700 --> 16:31.500
Where is everyone?

16:31.500 --> 16:33.200
I told them you had an emergency.

16:33.500 --> 16:34.600
We'll do it another time.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.200
But I'm just 15 minutes late.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.100
I didn't know how much
longer you were going to be.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.400
And they're not that excited

16:39.400 --> 16:41.400
about adding green elements
to their house anyway.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.300
But I was going to get them excited.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.200
I have samples. I have suggestions.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.700
I have a plan that
would save them money.

16:46.700 --> 16:48.100
It's okay. You still can.

16:48.100 --> 16:51.000
You can use your samples
and suggestions and your plan.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.600
We just-- We'll do it another day.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.000
So, how are you?

16:55.800 --> 16:58.400
Well, I'm kind of annoyed.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.000
You know, I stayed up late to
make sure I had everything together.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.600
I had everything together.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.200
It's okay, Anne.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.300
The meeting isn't that
important. How's the baby?

17:06.300 --> 17:07.400
The baby's fine.

17:07.900 --> 17:09.599
The doctor said that the baby's fine.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.500
I have to have some tests later on,
but the doctor said that everything's fine.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.700
So you didn't want me to come with you.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.000
Not really. It'd be kind
of awkward this visit.

17:17.000 --> 17:17.900
But later on, of course.

17:17.900 --> 17:21.000
Did you tell the doctor
that it's not George's baby?

17:21.000 --> 17:21.800
Why do you ask?

17:21.800 --> 17:24.500
I was just wondering if that's why
you didn't ask me to go.

17:25.099 --> 17:28.000
Don't the dads usually
go to the appointments?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.700
Well, Dad, Mom didn't feel like

17:29.700 --> 17:31.900
explaining everything
to the doctor this morning

17:31.900 --> 17:33.700
because she had to go to bed
and get up early

17:33.700 --> 17:35.600
so she wouldn't disappoint
you and your clients

17:35.600 --> 17:37.600
who couldn't even wait 15 minutes.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.800
Look, since this meeting isn't happening,

17:40.800 --> 17:43.100
I'm just going to meet Amy
at the church this afternoon.

17:43.300 --> 17:44.400
I'll talk to you later.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.700
Wait. Anne, stop.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.300
I'm sorry. I'm just--

17:49.300 --> 17:51.800
I'm excited. And nervous.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.200
- And curious.
- Curious?

17:54.200 --> 17:57.400
Yeah. I just don't know how this
could have happened to the two of us.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.400
Maybe someone wasn't quite as
handy with a condom as he claimed.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.200
Is everything okay, David?

18:07.200 --> 18:08.100
I don't know.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.000
Oh, padrone, what's up?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.900
Just thought I'd come in and help
out this afternoon for old time's sake.

18:16.900 --> 18:19.400
What? You didn't say anything
about that on the ride over.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.000
Yeah. I figured I'd stay for a while.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.600
Dad, I can do this.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.800
I got everything for the regulars
already cut and packaged.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.000
It's right here in the case,
Ben, by name and order.

18:29.100 --> 18:32.200
And the basket orders have
slowed down since the holidays,

18:32.200 --> 18:33.400
so I got them out early.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.000
And Danny's in the back if you need him.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.100
So, you don't think
I can do the job, either.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.900
Dad, you don't have to stay here.
You should go to the funeral.

18:40.900 --> 18:42.400
I don't want to go to the funeral.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.100
I never go to funerals. You know that.

18:44.100 --> 18:46.500
You never work at the butcher
shop, either. I know that.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.400
Careful with the 'tude, dude.
You don't want to get fired.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.700
Here. Get your apron on.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.400
Let's get going.
I want to get out of here.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.900
Yes, ma'am, on my way.

18:57.100 --> 19:00.300
Thinks he's a grown man, and it's
gotten worse since the baby got here.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.000
Yeah, I heard him talking to Ricky.

19:02.200 --> 19:06.200
But Ricky might not be the best
resource for information on waiting,

19:06.200 --> 19:07.200
if you know what I mean.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.700
Okay, good seeing you, Leo.
Thanks. I'll be back to lock up.

19:15.900 --> 19:16.600
The rush is over.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.600
The moms stop by on the way
home from school with the kids.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.800
There's not much to do. I'll be fine.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.100
I'm sure you will be.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.200
I just wanted to
spend some time with you.

19:24.200 --> 19:28.700
I mean, we haven't had time to talk
about Amy or the baby or anything lately.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.100
There's not much to talk about.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.200
What do you mean by that?

19:31.500 --> 19:33.900
- We're not doing anything.
- Well, you're 15.

19:34.100 --> 19:35.500
You're too young to be doing anything.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.900
Tell that to all
the 15-year-olds having sex.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.100
That's their parents' job.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.700
It's my job to tell you that
you're too young to have sex,

19:41.700 --> 19:43.500
and you of all people should know that.

19:43.700 --> 19:46.900
Your girlfriend just had a baby,
a baby she's not prepared to have,

19:46.900 --> 19:49.000
a baby she's struggling to take care of.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.200
She's had sex. I haven't.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.300
It's not some kind of a contest.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.900
Who can get there first,
or who has or who hasn't.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.200
Yes, it is.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.700
The older I get, the more time
I spend thinking about it.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.700
I can't help it.
I mean, you've seen Amy.

20:03.700 --> 20:04.800
I have seen Amy.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.400
She's a very pretty girl.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.700
But come on, Ben.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.400
Haven't you learned anything
about everything she's been through?

20:10.400 --> 20:12.700
Yes. I've learned to be careful.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.600
And I hope you're being careful, too.

20:14.600 --> 20:15.900
I don't just mean with sex.

20:15.900 --> 20:17.700
- What do you mean by that?
- I don't know.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.200
Do you really know this woman?

20:19.300 --> 20:21.400
I mean, do you really
know who Betty is?

20:21.700 --> 20:24.100
I mean, she could just be another
woman who's after your money.

20:24.100 --> 20:27.200
She could be, but I don't think so.
And mind your own business.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.600
And don't tell me to mind my business,

20:28.600 --> 20:32.000
'cause your business is my business
until you're on your own, mister.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.600
And how can I ever be on my own?

20:34.100 --> 20:35.400
It's always going to be
your butcher shop

20:35.400 --> 20:38.300
and your sausage company and
your house and your everything.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.600
But you know what? It's my sex life.

20:40.700 --> 20:41.600
I quit.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.600
- How you gonna get home?
- I'll take the bus.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.800
You got bus fare?

20:45.100 --> 20:47.200
- No.
- It's a long way to walk.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.200
On the other hand,
maybe a long walk'd do you good.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.800
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.000
Grace, your dad would want
you to go to the service.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.300
He spent a lot of time planning it.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.700
Very creative, your dad.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.700
I never listened to what my dad wanted.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.300
I think we all know that.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.600
Jack told me.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.300
No.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.600
It's okay. It's okay, Grace.

21:10.900 --> 21:11.900
It happened.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.600
Surely you don't think that just
because you and Jack were together--

21:15.600 --> 21:18.200
No, stop. I can't believe Jack told you.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.100
He knows how bad I already feel.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.100
- God.
- Of course Jack told me.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.100
He's my son. He tells me everything.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.500
Did he also tell you that
he tried to have sex

21:26.500 --> 21:29.200
with every girl he could get his
hands on when we were broken up?

21:29.400 --> 21:31.100
- Did he tell you that?
- He did.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.700
So he did. I knew it.

21:33.700 --> 21:36.000
Well, he didn't put it like that.
It wasn't like that.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.200
I know he--

21:38.000 --> 21:41.700
Grace, my point is nothing
you did caused your father to die.

21:41.700 --> 21:45.100
You and Jack are not responsible
for your father's untimely departure.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.500
You didn't kill anyone.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.300
Obviously you're okay
with your son having sex,

21:48.300 --> 21:49.900
because you're still alive.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.600
But my dad--

21:52.400 --> 21:56.300
My daddy, he didn't want me to
have sex, and I did have sex.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.900
And it was fun.

21:58.300 --> 21:59.400
It was sinfully fun.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.600
It was the most fun I've
ever had in my whole life.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.400
And that's why it was wrong.
It was so wrong that it killed him.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.800
Let's just think about this.

22:06.100 --> 22:07.600
Even if your theory is true,

22:07.600 --> 22:10.300
and you could literally
kill your parent if you had sex,

22:10.800 --> 22:13.300
your dad had already been
set free from this life when you--

22:13.300 --> 22:15.400
Set free? Did Jack tell you that?

22:15.400 --> 22:18.400
- God, I hate Jack.
- No, he did not mention that.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.000
All right, I won't lie. He did.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.500
But, Grace, listen to me.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
I don't think it
was wrong because it was fun.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.100
Sex is supposed to be fun.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.900
It's also supposed to be
reserved for marriage

22:30.000 --> 22:34.400
because it's so fun that God wouldn't
want us to have that much fun too young

22:34.400 --> 22:35.800
or with a lot of different people.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.100
No, that's-- that's not right.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.200
Can I tell you the truth?

22:40.600 --> 22:42.800
I came into this business
late in the game.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.900
And most of my colleagues
would totally disagree with me.

22:46.700 --> 22:48.000
I don't think it's necessarily wrong

22:48.000 --> 22:50.600
to have sex before marriage
in every single case.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.300
I just think you're too young
when you're in high school,

22:52.300 --> 22:54.600
because sex can lead
to an unwanted pregnancy.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.300
Or physical or
emotional problems, or worse.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.000
But as far as sin is concerned,

22:59.600 --> 23:01.900
I tend to think God set up
the rules in the first place

23:01.900 --> 23:05.000
to protect women from being treated
like property in those days.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.400
Just like they still are in many places.

23:08.300 --> 23:10.800
People need boundaries, Grace.
Men and women.

23:11.500 --> 23:14.900
Especially when reason is
so easily overruled by feelings.

23:14.900 --> 23:17.700
It's just that it's best to be in
the protected relationship of marriage

23:17.700 --> 23:20.300
because things can
go other than as planned.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.400
Sex is very complicated.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.000
Then again, it can be very simple, so...

23:26.800 --> 23:28.900
Am I making any sense
here at all, Grace?

23:29.300 --> 23:30.800
Sin is just missing the mark,

23:30.800 --> 23:33.900
going off course from what God
would want from us, supposedly.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.000
And you may have missed the mark,

23:36.900 --> 23:38.600
but you didn't kill anyone, Grace.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.100
Your mom and Tom are waiting for us.

23:42.100 --> 23:45.200
Please. Please go to the
funeral with your family.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.600
I can't.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.400
I just can't.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.600
Your mom has lost her husband, Grace.

23:50.700 --> 23:53.000
But she can always get a new husband.

23:53.300 --> 23:55.300
I can never get another Dad.

24:09.500 --> 24:10.300
Hey.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.300
I wanted to catch you before you left.

24:12.300 --> 24:13.500
I'm not going.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.900
I was, but I'm not.

24:17.100 --> 24:19.000
And what were you
hoping to catch me doing?

24:19.100 --> 24:20.700
I'm not doing anything.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.300
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

24:25.400 --> 24:29.200
My best friend's father just died,
and she thinks it's all my fault.

24:29.400 --> 24:33.200
And now so does Jack,
and so does everyone else.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.600
Adrian, it's not your fault.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.200
I know, but...

24:37.100 --> 24:39.000
the Christians are blaming me.

24:39.400 --> 24:40.200
What?

24:40.300 --> 24:43.600
I told her not to have sex.
I knew she wasn't ready.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.300
- And?
- She was trying to be like me.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.400
Everyone tries to be like me.

24:49.900 --> 24:52.500
I can't help it if
everyone wants to be like me.

24:53.300 --> 24:55.000
Especially the Christians.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.200
Be like you how?

25:01.900 --> 25:03.500
I like sex.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.400
I like having sex.

25:08.300 --> 25:12.000
I'm responsible
and I take care of myself,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.600
and I don't feel guilty about it, and--

25:19.400 --> 25:23.400
Wait. Maybe this is God's way of
telling me I shouldn't be having sex.

25:23.400 --> 25:27.000
Maybe God is trying to get to me
by punishing my best friend.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.600
Maybe it is wrong.

25:30.700 --> 25:33.100
No, don't. Don't look up.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.900
I don't want to chance it.
God might strike you dead, too.

25:35.900 --> 25:38.300
You're not gonna kill me
if you have sex, Adrian.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.500
But it wouldn't kill me if
you stopped having sex for a while.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.800
- Adrian?
- Maybe I will.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.700
Maybe I will stop having sex.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.700
Ricky doesn't really love me anyway,

25:54.700 --> 25:59.200
and I don't have anyone else
to have sex with right now.

25:59.200 --> 26:02.200
So it will be a matter of
both revenge and practicality.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.100
I think we should talk about
this more after the funeral.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.000
Come on. You should
be there for your friend.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.900
She's not even speaking to me.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.700
She'll be speaking
to you at some point.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.700
And you'll want to
have been there for her.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
I let a jury go home early
just so I could go with you.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.100
- Why?
- ??

26:21.900 --> 26:24.800
Because I missed more than
16 years of your life.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.900
And I don't want to miss another day.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.200
Good or bad.

26:30.700 --> 26:31.500
Come on.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.300
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.000
Come on.

26:52.100 --> 26:54.100
I gotta drop Ashley off,
and then I'll come back.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.600
You're going to the service?
Mom's not going to like that.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.500
- Why?
- You know why.

27:02.500 --> 27:03.500
I don't know why.

27:03.500 --> 27:06.000
'Cause he was flirting with
the widow, his ex-wife.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.100
I was not. I absolutely was not.

27:08.100 --> 27:09.700
- Mom thinks you were.
- It seems odd,

27:09.700 --> 27:12.400
if she's pregnant with another
guy's baby, that she'd be jealous.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.900
I don't think she was jealous, Ashley.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.500
I just think that she thought
it was grossly inappropriate.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.800
I can hardly wait until I've had a baby,
so we can speak the same language again.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.700
"Grossly inappropriate"?

27:22.700 --> 27:25.200
More grossly inappropriate than
having a baby with a guy

27:25.200 --> 27:26.200
she's only known for a few months,

27:26.200 --> 27:27.400
when she's still married to me?

27:27.400 --> 27:28.500
I have to go.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.200
She annoys me sometimes.
I love her, but she annoys me.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.300
Yeah, me, too.

27:34.800 --> 27:35.900
Are you sure it isn't your baby?

27:35.900 --> 27:37.800
I'm sure. I told you.

27:48.200 --> 27:48.900
- Hi.
- Are you here

27:48.900 --> 27:50.100
so I can go to the funeral?

27:50.100 --> 27:52.600
No, I'm here so that the women that
you work with can go to the funeral.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.100
Can't I just go to the part
that's at the church

27:54.100 --> 27:55.600
and not the graveside service?

27:55.600 --> 27:58.100
Amy, I'm here to be with you,
to help out at the nursery,

27:58.100 --> 27:59.500
because you have to work.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.000
But I don't have to work if you're here.

28:01.100 --> 28:02.500
- Please, Mom?
- Amy.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.200
Everyone is going. Everyone.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.100
Did you see how full
the other parking lot is?

28:06.100 --> 28:07.300
Yes, I did.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.400
Dr. Bowman has been a doctor
in this community for 20 years,

28:10.400 --> 28:11.700
and he was a deacon at the church,

28:11.700 --> 28:13.700
and I told the women that you work
with that I would help out

28:13.700 --> 28:15.100
so that they can go to the funeral.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.500
So you'd rather help them than me.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.300
I thought that I was helping you.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.400
I thought that I was helping
you give back to the church,

28:20.400 --> 28:22.100
who has given so much to you.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.700
To my daughter and to my grandson.

28:26.300 --> 28:27.700
Amy, what's wrong?

28:27.900 --> 28:28.800
Really, what's wrong?

28:28.800 --> 28:32.500
I'm missing out on everything
everyone else is doing.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.300
I feel like Old Mother Hubbard.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.800
I feel like and I look
like Old Mother Hubbard.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.100
Only good thing that came out
of all this is that I have boobs.

28:42.100 --> 28:43.500
Amy, it's okay.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.800
All new mothers feel
overwhelmed and isolated.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.800
I'm not just a new mother.

28:49.100 --> 28:52.500
I'm a new mother in high school,
and that's just so wrong.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.700
Maybe God is punishing me.
And if he is, I can't take it.

28:56.700 --> 28:57.800
Who said that?

28:58.100 --> 29:00.100
Someone said that
God is punishing you?

29:00.400 --> 29:02.100
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

29:03.100 --> 29:05.800
'Cause I thought about it,
and maybe God is punishing you, too.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.100
You know what, Amy?

29:07.100 --> 29:08.500
I doubt that God punishes people

29:08.500 --> 29:11.500
nearly as much as people punish
each other and themselves.

29:11.700 --> 29:13.700
John is not a punishment.

29:13.700 --> 29:16.900
That's what I said when Grace
said that, but I don't know.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.700
Maybe John's a blessing and a curse.

29:20.700 --> 29:22.300
John is not a curse.

29:22.600 --> 29:23.800
Grace Bowman said that?

29:23.800 --> 29:25.900
She didn't say "curse,"
but she said "punishment."

29:25.900 --> 29:27.300
What's the difference?

29:27.800 --> 29:29.700
She said it when we were
at her house the other night,

29:29.700 --> 29:32.000
and I can't quit thinking about it.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.100
Amy.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.200
Grace just lost her father.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.500
She's not thinking right.
She didn't mean it.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.200
She will apologize to you at some point.

29:40.900 --> 29:43.200
Don't forget all the good
that Grace has done for you.

29:43.500 --> 29:44.700
Grace is a nice girl.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.100
Not anymore.

29:46.700 --> 29:47.800
Didn't you hear?

29:48.500 --> 29:50.200
Grace had sex with Jack.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.800
She liked it.

29:53.000 --> 29:53.800
What?

29:53.800 --> 29:56.100
That makes it a bigger sin,
that she liked it?

29:56.700 --> 29:58.800
Come on, we'll talk about
this later. We better get inside.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.400
She did. She really liked it a lot.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.200
Yeah, well, okay. A lot of people do.

30:04.800 --> 30:05.800
Come on, let's go.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.700
Is this the church?

30:14.100 --> 30:16.100
it's awfully pretty.

30:16.300 --> 30:17.500
Yes, it is.

30:17.800 --> 30:20.000
- Thanks for the ride, Betty.
- Oh, no problem.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.200
I'm just happy I came along when I did.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.000
That may well be your
purpose in life, Betty--

30:24.000 --> 30:25.700
to come along at the right time.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.200
I know you got to
my dad at the right time.

30:29.100 --> 30:31.300
Right before him and I
go our separate ways.

30:31.300 --> 30:33.800
Oh, no. I hope that doesn't happen.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.500
Leo loves you very much, Ben.

30:37.900 --> 30:40.700
And whatever argument
you may have with him,

30:41.600 --> 30:42.900
I'm sure you'll make up.

30:42.900 --> 30:43.800
You have to.

30:43.800 --> 30:47.400
Well, we don't have to, and
I don't even know if I want to.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.100
Ben, I have to tell you something.

30:52.900 --> 30:55.200
All this talk about
you breaking up with your dad,

30:55.200 --> 31:01.200
I mean, it really scares me, because,
well, that's what happened to me.

31:01.500 --> 31:05.600
When I was your age, or maybe
it was a year older than you,

31:05.900 --> 31:10.000
my dad and I had a big
argument about my boyfriend.

31:10.100 --> 31:12.800
He didn't think that
Frank and I should be dating

31:12.800 --> 31:16.500
because Frank was
ten years older than me,

31:16.800 --> 31:21.000
and it just seemed wrong to him
that a man in his 20s

31:21.000 --> 31:24.400
would be dating a girl
that was barely 16.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.600
Even though I had
a very mature look at 16.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.300
But I loved Frank.

31:30.300 --> 31:35.600
So, I left my family and I married him.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.600
And then I found out,
just a few years later,

31:39.600 --> 31:42.600
that I had made a big mistake.

31:43.900 --> 31:47.500
And it was very difficult
getting out of Frank's house.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.900
And when I did, I had nowhere to go

31:50.900 --> 31:54.400
because my mom and dad didn't want
to have anything to do with me.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.500
I don't think it would be a mistake
for Amy and I to get married.

31:57.800 --> 32:00.900
Legally married. And someday soon.

32:01.400 --> 32:02.700
As soon as possible.

32:03.600 --> 32:07.600
I'm feeling a very sincere
need to-- to be married.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.200
And I'm not ten years older than Amy,

32:10.200 --> 32:14.100
and our circumstances are a
little different than yours and Frank's.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.400
And my dad and I
aren't arguing about Amy.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.000
We're arguing about us.

32:20.300 --> 32:22.400
But thanks for the ride, Betty.

32:23.700 --> 32:27.900
Although I don't really appreciate
the unsolicited advice.

32:27.900 --> 32:29.600
I'm just glad I could help.

32:30.600 --> 32:31.500
Yeah.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.300
I'll tell you why they're not here.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.200
Because the service isn't at the church
that my mother used to go to.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.700
It's not her church, so she
doesn't consider it a church,

32:53.700 --> 32:54.800
and she wouldn't come.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.800
And when she found out
your dad was cremated,

32:57.800 --> 32:59.300
well, it really got her upset.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.100
She thinks he's going straight to Hell.

33:01.700 --> 33:03.700
And I'm going with him
for having him cremated.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.600
She's so difficult.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.700
She's always been so difficult.

33:08.600 --> 33:12.500
I don't want to be difficult like that,
but I don't have my parents to lean on.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.200
And I never really did.

33:17.100 --> 33:19.900
- But I do have you and Tom.
- You don't need to lean on me.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.900
You're strong. You're
the strongest person I know.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.200
And Tom doesn't need me, either.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.200
He can't wait to deliver the eulogy.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.400
That was your father's way
of getting Tom to be strong.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.000
He always does
what people expect of him.

33:34.700 --> 33:37.300
And let's face it, he does
have your father's sense of humor.

33:38.900 --> 33:41.800
Grace, it's just a few minutes
on the church steps.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
I can't.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.100
You know what?

33:44.700 --> 33:46.700
At this point, I'm just...

33:48.000 --> 33:50.900
I'm tired, and I am
ready for this to be over.

33:50.900 --> 33:53.000
I'm ready to grieve in private,

33:53.700 --> 33:56.100
be by myself and with you and Tom.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.500
- So if you want to stay here--
- I want to stay here.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.000
Okay. It doesn't really matter.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.800
I just don't want you to regret it later.

34:05.700 --> 34:07.800
And like I said, it's just a few minutes.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.800
Sorry, Mrs. Bowman.

34:14.699 --> 34:15.900
It's okay, Ricky.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.600
Thanks for being here.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.699
Is there anything I can do for you?

34:19.699 --> 34:20.900
I don't think so.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.900
I'd like to get Grace out of the car,

34:22.900 --> 34:25.300
but I don't think you or
anyone else can do that for me.

34:25.300 --> 34:26.600
I can do that for you.

34:26.699 --> 34:28.100
I will do that for you.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.800
If that's all I can do here, I'll do it.

34:31.100 --> 34:32.000
Thank you.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.199
I'm sorry about your dad.

34:42.500 --> 34:45.199
But I'm going to give you three
minutes to get out of the car.

34:46.300 --> 34:49.800
And then I'm going
to have to get you out??

34:57.900 --> 35:00.800
I'd like to know what's
going on with Ricky and Grace.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.600
Well, ask someone.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.600
Hey, gossip girl. What's going on?

35:04.600 --> 35:06.700
I don't know what you mean by that.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.700
But Ricky's trying to
get Grace out of the car.

35:11.800 --> 35:12.900
Are you okay?

35:13.800 --> 35:19.000
Yeah, I'm-- I'm okay.
Just another reason not to have sex.

35:22.100 --> 35:23.500
He's with Grace.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.100
Jeez.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.900
I'm not getting out of the car.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.200
So why don't you
just get out of the car

35:34.600 --> 35:37.100
so we can get on with this whole
stupid service, so I can go home?

35:37.300 --> 35:39.900
No. I'm not leaving you inside the car.

35:39.900 --> 35:42.100
And I'm not leaving you
when we get outside the car.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.900
I told you, I'm not
getting out of the car.

35:43.900 --> 35:46.600
Yeah, you are. You are getting out
of the car one way or the other.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.400
- I don't think so.
- I know so.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.700
Don't talk to me like that.

35:49.700 --> 35:52.100
I will drag your ass
out of this car if I have to,

35:52.100 --> 35:55.800
because you are going to go to whatever
service your dad planned for himself.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.900
Whatever he planned
is what he wanted.

35:57.900 --> 36:00.400
This service is his last request of you.

36:00.500 --> 36:03.300
You may have messed up and didn't
do other things he asked of you,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
but you are not messing up again.

36:06.100 --> 36:08.300
Because this time, I'm here.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.000
And I'm going to make you
do the right thing.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.600
Get out of the car, Grace.

36:15.100 --> 36:16.700
Your mother wants you out of the car,

36:16.700 --> 36:18.800
and I told her I'd get you out of the car.

36:20.900 --> 36:22.100
Don't touch me.

36:22.100 --> 36:24.100
I will touch you if I have to touch you.

36:24.100 --> 36:27.400
I'd rather have you angry at me
than feel guilty the rest of your life

36:27.400 --> 36:29.200
for not going to your father's funeral.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.700
Maybe we should just go ahead.

36:32.900 --> 36:36.300
No, let's just wait a few more minutes.
He looked pretty determined.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.800
I can't stand here much longer.

36:39.700 --> 36:40.900
I thought you were working.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.100
I quit.

36:42.700 --> 36:43.900
I couldn't take the pressure.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.400
Trying to live up to your dad's success?

36:45.400 --> 36:48.000
No. Not trying. Not anymore.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.900
Hey, your dad's a good man.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.200
And he doesn't care if you're in the
sausage business or the biscuit business.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.500
He just wants you to be happy.

36:54.800 --> 36:55.900
I'm not happy.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.700
That's 'cause you're not
sleeping with my daughter.

36:58.100 --> 37:00.000
And that makes me very happy.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.900
It's too soon, and you're too young,

37:01.900 --> 37:03.700
even if you do
think of yourself as married.

37:03.700 --> 37:06.500
So unless you want to end up
in the same place as Dr. Bowman,

37:07.600 --> 37:09.000
you respect Amy's wishes.

37:09.800 --> 37:10.600
You got it?

37:11.300 --> 37:11.900
Yeah.

37:16.900 --> 37:17.800
Have you been--

37:20.300 --> 37:21.600
Don't be stupid, Jack.

37:21.900 --> 37:23.000
Never drink alone.

37:24.800 --> 37:25.900
How's Anne?

37:27.100 --> 37:28.700
- Anne?
- Yeah.

37:29.600 --> 37:32.200
- She's fine.
- You realize you're me now.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.000
Where's your Jesus in all this?

37:39.500 --> 37:40.300
What?

37:40.400 --> 37:42.800
Yeah, where's this Jesus
you used to talk about?

37:42.900 --> 37:45.800
You told me he'd forgive me
for all the times I had sex.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.500
He won't forgive you
for the one time you did it?

37:50.000 --> 37:51.400
You're a hypocrite.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.700
But you didn't kill anyone.
You didn't kill your dad.

37:56.100 --> 37:57.400
In fact, if your dad was here now,

37:57.400 --> 37:59.800
he'd probably kill you
for acting like this.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.800
Grace, your brother's out
there on the church steps

38:03.800 --> 38:05.700
waiting to say words
he doesn't want to say

38:05.700 --> 38:09.500
because that's what your dad
asked him to do as his last request.

38:10.400 --> 38:16.000
If Tom can step up to the plate
at a time like this, so can you.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.800
Get over yourself.

38:17.800 --> 38:20.800
- It's easier for Tom.
- It's easier for Tom?

38:20.900 --> 38:23.100
Please. Nothing's easy for Tom.

38:23.300 --> 38:26.800
He has to try twice as hard as
the rest of us every day of the year.

38:27.300 --> 38:30.100
You think that's not
true today of all days?

38:30.100 --> 38:32.400
But he doesn't have to
live with this guilt.

38:34.500 --> 38:37.400
I can't live with this guilt. I can't.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.300
I feel horrible. I never even knew
it was possible to feel this horrible.

38:43.300 --> 38:47.500
If you're so upset because you think
you really disappointed your dad in life,

38:48.800 --> 38:51.200
are you going to also
disappoint him in his death?

38:51.200 --> 38:54.300
Or are you just going to go out
there and do what you have to do?

38:54.300 --> 38:57.200
We all have to do
whatever we have to do, Grace.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.400
You have to do this.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.300
He loved you.

39:03.500 --> 39:06.000
No matter what, he loved you.
You know that.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.000
Don't. Don't do it. Don't give in.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.500
Stay angry. Angry enough
at me to get out of the car

39:14.500 --> 39:16.900
and go stand by your
mother and your brother.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.800
- Thank you.
- I owed him.

39:35.000 --> 39:35.900
I don't care.

39:36.900 --> 39:40.100
As long as she's okay, I don't care.

40:04.300 --> 40:05.700
Thanks for coming.

40:06.000 --> 40:11.900
My dad loved you all,
and we all loved him right back.

40:12.000 --> 40:17.700
He was a good man.
He cared about everyone.

40:17.900 --> 40:19.700
And wherever he was,

40:21.000 --> 40:26.200
he lived in the moment
and he made people happy.

40:26.200 --> 40:34.700
And so today he asked that
we say good-bye to him

40:34.900 --> 40:42.000
with a ride to one of his
favorite places in the whole world

40:42.000 --> 40:45.400
when he wasn't in bed with my mom.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.400
I will miss him.

40:50.800 --> 40:54.900
But someday, I'll be with him again.

40:55.300 --> 41:01.200
As will all of his friends
and our family.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.600
And my mom.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.600
Even Jack and Grace.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.300
No.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.500
Especially Grace.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
So,

41:18.600 --> 41:20.200
until then...
