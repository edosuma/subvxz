Corky, why don't you
tell us your story.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.988
Well, as you know,
my story is not a

01:06.990 --> 01:09.324
"really tragic" story,

01:09.326 --> 01:10.759
unless...

01:10.761 --> 01:12.696
boredom is tragic.

01:13.797 --> 01:15.330
I, um...

01:15.332 --> 01:16.831
you know, I was married.

01:16.833 --> 01:21.069
I had every comfort
you could ask for.

01:21.071 --> 01:24.375
I thought that's what was gonna
make my life meaningful.

01:25.909 --> 01:29.112
I just stopped wanting
to go to parties, and...

01:31.080 --> 01:33.350
play tennis...

01:35.351 --> 01:37.351
with my girlfriends.

01:37.353 --> 01:38.986
For the record,
I'd like to say

01:38.988 --> 01:40.688
that I think
I'd rather iron sheets

01:40.690 --> 01:42.122
than play tennis any day.

01:42.124 --> 01:46.727
When I was,
uh, about 11 years old,

01:46.729 --> 01:50.065
I lived with my grandmother
near the Black Forest, and...

01:50.067 --> 01:53.367
in a little house,
second floor...

01:53.369 --> 01:55.869
and I had a cat.

01:55.871 --> 01:58.072
Her name was Fifi.

01:58.074 --> 02:01.810
Well, I did get an Oregon
Cultural Heritage Award.

02:01.812 --> 02:04.111
Ah, these awards
are not important.

02:04.113 --> 02:06.146
- Please.
- Okay.

02:06.148 --> 02:08.149
I got a prescription
for Valium,

02:08.151 --> 02:11.485
which at least
made the days go...

02:11.487 --> 02:13.121
by quicker.

02:13.123 --> 02:15.355
Yeah, okay,
there's this rock

02:15.357 --> 02:18.727
that was about this big
that had these grooves in it,

02:18.729 --> 02:21.361
like, uh, you know,
little bumps, and I said,

02:21.363 --> 02:24.098
"Well, Aunt Janey,
what is this?"

02:24.100 --> 02:26.101
And she said, "What?
You don't know what that is?"

02:26.103 --> 02:27.968
And I was like, "No."

02:27.970 --> 02:29.471
And she's like,
"Well, that's my titty rock."

02:29.473 --> 02:31.506
And I was like,
"Your titty rock?"

02:31.508 --> 02:33.942
She was like, "Yeah, my titty rock."

02:33.944 --> 02:35.175
"That's for when
you get in fights with girls.

02:35.177 --> 02:36.978
You punch 'em
in the tit with it."

02:36.980 --> 02:38.780
Not joking, not kidding.

02:38.782 --> 02:41.448
Then one day, I just, like,

02:41.450 --> 02:45.455
took off all my clothes
and walked down the street.

02:47.022 --> 02:49.190
And...

02:49.192 --> 02:50.924
the mailman...

02:50.926 --> 02:52.160
found me and...

02:52.162 --> 02:53.995
he brought me home and

02:53.997 --> 02:56.464
called my husband,
like I was a child.

02:56.466 --> 02:59.900
And I, you know, I'm still
wearing my wedding ring, but...

02:59.902 --> 03:01.536
I'm...

03:01.538 --> 03:03.103
divorced now, and I'm...

03:03.105 --> 03:04.938
I'm much happier.

03:04.940 --> 03:07.744
Maybe life's actually
not supposed to be...

03:08.844 --> 03:11.181
as meaningful
as we think it is.

03:12.516 --> 03:14.181
- Thanks, Corky.
- Thanks, Corky.

03:14.183 --> 03:15.885
Mm.

04:50.914 --> 04:52.614
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

04:52.616 --> 04:56.150
<i>please welcome to the stage
Portland's celebrity cartoonist</i>

04:56.152 --> 04:58.518
<i>John Callahan!</i>

05:14.270 --> 05:16.537
Hi. My name is John,
and I'm an alcoholic.

05:16.539 --> 05:19.140
Hi, John.

05:19.142 --> 05:21.042
It's good to be here.

05:21.044 --> 05:23.176
The last day that I walked,

05:23.178 --> 05:26.246
I... I woke up
without a hangover.

05:31.186 --> 05:34.621
The last day I walked,
I woke up without a hangover.

05:34.623 --> 05:37.558
I was still loaded
from drinking the night before.

06:00.717 --> 06:04.318
I knew I had an hour or so
of grace before the...

06:04.320 --> 06:06.621
nervousness...

06:08.024 --> 06:10.127
of withdrawal symptoms set in.

06:23.238 --> 06:26.207
What if I lost control,
flipped out?

06:27.376 --> 06:28.978
Fuck.

06:35.185 --> 06:37.652
The closest store
where I could buy booze

06:37.654 --> 06:40.324
was near a major intersection.

06:52.001 --> 06:54.068
- How are you?
- Staying cool?

06:54.070 --> 06:55.436
- It's hot out there, isn't it?
- Yeah.

06:55.438 --> 06:57.337
- Good beach weather.
- Yeah. Whew.

06:57.339 --> 06:59.207
<i>I tried to talk to the</i>

06:59.209 --> 07:02.143
owner of the store
and act real casual.

07:02.145 --> 07:03.210
I work for Alvarado
house painter.

07:03.212 --> 07:05.046
- Oh.
- We got tons of work.

07:05.048 --> 07:08.248
Oh, you know, like I had
everything under control.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.051
But...

07:10.053 --> 07:13.121
they'd have to be blind
not to see my hand shaking.

07:13.123 --> 07:14.789
Um...

07:14.791 --> 07:18.325
Yeah, I guess I'll just
take that, uh, Tres Abuelos.

07:18.327 --> 07:20.097
Yeah, tequila.

08:07.277 --> 08:08.779
Hey, how's it going?

08:09.779 --> 08:11.412
Wow, pretty groovy day, huh?

08:11.414 --> 08:13.181
Oh, yeah.

08:13.183 --> 08:15.316
- Surf's coming up.
- Yeah.

08:15.318 --> 08:16.717
Sky gets any bluer,

08:16.719 --> 08:18.518
it'll be singing
a Muddy Waters tune.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.390
Sorry?

08:21.724 --> 08:23.323
I'm a songwriter.

08:23.325 --> 08:26.426
I listen to a lot
of different music.

08:26.428 --> 08:28.328
- Um...
- Want a drink?

08:28.330 --> 08:30.097
I'm... I'm good.

08:30.099 --> 08:32.232
Um, I'll see you around
sometime, okay?

08:32.234 --> 08:33.404
Oh. All right.

08:40.275 --> 08:42.442
You've got
a problem, Callahan.

08:45.314 --> 08:47.447
I know three things
about my real mother:

08:47.449 --> 08:50.350
she was Irish-American,
she had red hair,

08:50.352 --> 08:52.119
she was a school teacher.

08:52.121 --> 08:53.790
Oh, yeah.

08:55.357 --> 08:57.358
And she didn't want me.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.792
Okay.

08:58.794 --> 09:01.295
Four things.

09:01.297 --> 09:04.532
The way with illegitimate
Catholic babies in those days

09:04.534 --> 09:07.268
was to remove them
from the mother of birth...

09:07.270 --> 09:09.803
...and put them in the care
of the nuns for six months

09:09.805 --> 09:12.508
in case the natural mother
should change her mind.

09:14.144 --> 09:16.377
Was my mother a queen?

09:16.379 --> 09:18.879
Was she a whore?

09:18.881 --> 09:20.848
Could I locate her
and surprise her,

09:20.850 --> 09:22.282
say, at a bank teller's window?

09:22.284 --> 09:24.518
"Yeah, I'd like
to cash this check, Mom."

09:56.419 --> 09:58.554
Oh, fuck. Help!

10:02.292 --> 10:04.425
- Oh, hey.
- Dude, you wiped out.

10:04.427 --> 10:06.393
- Nice.
- Can you help me up?

10:06.395 --> 10:08.229
- Yeah, all right.
- Easy, though.

10:08.231 --> 10:09.964
- Okay.
- All right, now, nice and easy.

10:09.966 --> 10:11.364
Don't try and show off.

10:11.366 --> 10:12.432
Yeah! Oh!

10:12.434 --> 10:13.633
Here, come around, turn around.

10:13.635 --> 10:14.634
- Here we go.
- All right.

10:14.636 --> 10:16.269
- Okay.
- Watch it.

10:16.271 --> 10:18.372
- Careful, careful.
- There we go. There we go.

10:18.374 --> 10:20.273
Yeah, lift him up.

10:20.275 --> 10:22.276
- You guys smell that?
- Oh, what's that smell?

10:22.278 --> 10:24.311
- Oh, that-that reeks, man.
- Oh.

10:24.313 --> 10:26.379
Yeah, pull up that
right leg right there.

10:26.381 --> 10:27.949
- Right here?
- Yeah.

10:27.951 --> 10:29.450
- You got it, dude.
- Yeah.

10:29.452 --> 10:30.951
Yeah, you lift up
that right pant leg there.

10:30.953 --> 10:32.652
Be brave.

10:32.654 --> 10:35.956
Yeah, just attach that
into the white thing.

10:35.958 --> 10:37.291
All right.

10:37.293 --> 10:39.326
- Thank you.
- You draw this?

10:39.328 --> 10:40.860
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

10:40.862 --> 10:42.330
- You get it?
- Awesome. Dude.

10:42.332 --> 10:43.630
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.566
Don't worry, boys.

10:46.568 --> 10:48.469
He won't get far on foot.

10:48.471 --> 10:50.003
It's a wheelchair.

10:50.005 --> 10:51.605
He can't get far
because he's injured, right?

10:51.607 --> 10:53.306
- That's right. Yeah.
- Okay, all right!

10:53.308 --> 10:54.709
Yeah, well, you know,

10:54.711 --> 10:56.509
my grandmom's
in a wheelchair, so...

10:56.511 --> 10:57.711
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:57.713 --> 10:59.312
- Sorry about that.
- Yeah.

10:59.314 --> 11:01.315
I draw these for a living,
but, you know,

11:01.317 --> 11:02.383
people get mad at me
'cause of the subject matter.

11:02.385 --> 11:04.351
- Not us.
- That's ridiculous.

11:04.353 --> 11:05.952
- These are awesome.
- All right. Cool.

11:05.954 --> 11:07.455
- Is that a car crash?
- Yeah.

11:07.457 --> 11:09.023
- What is that?
- There's, like, a dead guy

11:09.025 --> 11:10.358
- under the car.
- Are those all booze and stuff?

11:10.360 --> 11:11.625
Whoa.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.027
There's a five-dollar bill

11:13.029 --> 11:14.262
in my left shirt pocket.

11:14.264 --> 11:16.265
Go get me a short case.

11:34.049 --> 11:37.384
Oh, they could do it
and they'll do it over there!

11:45.028 --> 11:46.359
Hey, Snickers.

11:46.361 --> 11:48.329
How was your day?

11:48.331 --> 11:50.534
Did you find any time
to get in some exercise?

11:58.374 --> 12:00.675
You fucking asshole!

12:00.677 --> 12:02.310
You're fucking late!

12:02.312 --> 12:03.944
I've been sitting here
all goddamn day!

12:03.946 --> 12:05.680
It's been fucking wet!

12:05.682 --> 12:08.548
I got shit all over my pants
and there's no fucking drinks!

12:08.550 --> 12:10.518
You didn't leave me
a goddamn fucking drink!

12:10.520 --> 12:11.951
It's been three fucking hours!

12:11.953 --> 12:13.687
What do you
actually fucking do?

12:13.689 --> 12:17.023
I signed up to be
your attendant, not your slave.

12:17.025 --> 12:20.527
Bossing me around, you fucking
don't even give me five seconds

12:20.529 --> 12:22.529
before you're telling me
what to do.

12:22.531 --> 12:25.332
I told you I fucking hate it
when you give me orders.

12:25.334 --> 12:27.335
I'm gonna get to it
when I feel like it, John.

12:27.337 --> 12:28.969
All right?
How would you like it

12:28.971 --> 12:31.041
if I started pushing
you around all day?

12:34.744 --> 12:36.476
I'll give you a bath
in a minute.

12:36.478 --> 12:39.013
I need to wind down.
Here you go.

12:39.015 --> 12:41.385
Celebrate your independence.

<i>President Carter's standing</i>

Welcome to the Alano Club.

14:20.817 --> 14:22.715
I thought you were serious.

14:22.717 --> 14:24.518
No dogs, no quads.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.456
No. Come on, now.

14:35.497 --> 14:37.163
God, grant me the serenity...

14:37.165 --> 14:40.768
To accept the things
I cannot change,

14:40.770 --> 14:43.737
the courage to change
the things I can,

14:43.739 --> 14:45.809
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

14:47.143 --> 14:49.413

14:54.483 --> 14:56.683
Hi, Felix.

14:56.685 --> 14:58.585
- Hi, guys. Uh...
- Welcome.

14:58.587 --> 15:00.220
This is day 14.

15:00.222 --> 15:01.891
Good job.

15:06.629 --> 15:08.696
Uh, hi. I'm Joseph.

15:08.698 --> 15:09.830
I'm an alcoholic.

15:09.832 --> 15:11.865
Hi, Joseph.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.767
Today, I have 56 days.

15:13.769 --> 15:16.539
Awesome.

15:18.540 --> 15:20.773
It's tough, 'cause,
you know, out there,

15:20.775 --> 15:22.542
I feel like people want to hear

15:22.544 --> 15:24.744
how many years
you've been sober.

15:24.746 --> 15:26.913
But, uh, you know, coming here,

15:26.915 --> 15:30.783
I'm reminded how special it is
that I'm where I'm at, so...

15:30.785 --> 15:33.753
I remember a time when I didn't
think 30 days was possible,

15:33.755 --> 15:37.191
but here I am, so... thank you.

15:42.631 --> 15:44.697
Anyone else want to speak?

15:44.699 --> 15:46.300
My name's John Callahan,

15:46.302 --> 15:47.968
and I don't know
who my real mother is,

15:47.970 --> 15:50.474
and I was paralyzed
in a car accident.

15:52.542 --> 15:54.642
And...

15:54.644 --> 15:57.545
and I'm an alcoholic.

15:57.547 --> 15:59.812
Hi, John.

15:59.814 --> 16:01.882
Good to know you,
John Callahan,

16:01.884 --> 16:04.284
who is an alcoholic.

16:04.286 --> 16:07.654
You're in the right place,
I think.

16:07.656 --> 16:09.590
I'm Donnie,
and I'm an alcoholic.

16:09.592 --> 16:11.558
Hi, Donnie.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.192
Hi.

16:13.194 --> 16:16.297
And when I first entered
the program,

16:16.299 --> 16:19.832
I had two pairs of pants,

16:19.834 --> 16:22.235
one with shit in them
and one without.

16:24.307 --> 16:27.974
And I didn't care which one
of them I was wearing.

16:30.011 --> 16:34.248
Today, I celebrate mediocrity.

16:34.250 --> 16:38.051
I woke up and I put on
a non-shitty pair of pants.

16:38.053 --> 16:42.022
And I walked to get a cup of coffee,

16:42.024 --> 16:44.291
and it was fucking delicious.

16:44.293 --> 16:47.628
And my day's been pretty good,

16:47.630 --> 16:50.630
until I came in here
and saw all of you.

16:53.336 --> 16:55.702
Continue your story, John.

16:55.704 --> 16:57.971
Oh, right.

16:57.973 --> 17:00.373
The story. Um...

17:00.375 --> 17:03.813
Well, I got back to
the house around 4:00,

17:05.013 --> 17:09.049
<i>and saw Jesus Alvarado, my...</i>

17:09.050 --> 17:10.854
<i>employer.</i>

17:16.691 --> 17:19.326
Shit.

17:19.328 --> 17:21.031
John, what's up?

17:23.832 --> 17:26.065
I want you to meet Bill.

17:26.067 --> 17:27.733
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:27.736 --> 17:32.039
My small-town experience was...

17:32.041 --> 17:35.309
limited concerning disability.

17:35.311 --> 17:37.011
- How you doing? John.
- Good, good.

17:37.013 --> 17:39.816
<i>Jesus wanted me
to look at the guy's pen.</i>

17:41.883 --> 17:43.018
Check that out.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.022
Got to turn it upside down.

17:50.426 --> 17:53.327
Uh, I went inside for a drink.

17:54.964 --> 17:57.363
I'm coming back for events.

17:57.365 --> 17:59.332
- Oh, my God, I've lost it.
- Ah! Yes!

17:59.334 --> 18:00.967
- What's going on?
- I've lost the touch.

18:00.969 --> 18:02.069
- My shoe!
- Hi, John.

18:02.071 --> 18:04.103
- This is Bonnie.
- Oh, hi.

18:04.105 --> 18:05.673
I hear you're from,
um, Oregon.

18:05.675 --> 18:06.974
That's right.

18:06.976 --> 18:08.742
What do you guys
do up there for fun?

18:08.744 --> 18:10.343
Well, there's not a lot to do
in Oregon, you know?

18:10.345 --> 18:12.079
So a certain percentage of
the population drives down here

18:12.081 --> 18:13.946
to Long Beach to look for jobs.

18:13.948 --> 18:16.449
We are going to a party
tonight, if you want to come.

18:16.451 --> 18:17.451
Oh, really?

18:17.453 --> 18:18.952
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

18:18.954 --> 18:20.387
- Well...
- Want to drive us there?

18:20.389 --> 18:22.324
- I mean, I... Ooh.
- Oh.

18:25.761 --> 18:26.726
Oh.

18:26.728 --> 18:28.462
We're...

18:28.464 --> 18:30.930
We're getting
in trouble tonight.

18:30.932 --> 18:32.398
Am I happy?

18:32.400 --> 18:34.767
No. So...

18:34.769 --> 18:36.770
Divorced? Yeah.

18:36.772 --> 18:38.138
I'm seeing a couple guys now.

18:38.140 --> 18:40.773
I've been going to therapy.
Have you ever gone?

18:40.775 --> 18:43.409
It'd be so good for you.

18:43.411 --> 18:44.744
Just gotten off meat.

18:44.746 --> 18:46.080
Been kicking dairy.

18:46.082 --> 18:49.015
I'm gonna do life
without eggs now.

18:49.017 --> 18:52.820
Hey, um, I just need to use
the bathroom really quick.

18:52.822 --> 18:55.121
- Will you... will you be here?
- Uh, yeah. Okay.

19:17.479 --> 19:20.813
Hey, Terry, where's that girl
I was just talking to?

19:20.815 --> 19:23.082
- Um, the redhead girl?
- Yeah.

19:23.084 --> 19:24.984
I think she just left
with some friends.

19:24.986 --> 19:26.753
- She left the party?
- Mm-hmm.

19:26.755 --> 19:28.755
Well, good for her.

19:28.757 --> 19:30.757
- You guys are still here.
- She got places to be.

19:30.759 --> 19:32.059
- You're stuck with us.
- Yeah.

19:32.061 --> 19:35.495
- Nah.
- Far fucking out. Dexter.

19:35.497 --> 19:38.398
I'm Dexter.
Hey. I'm Dexter.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.134
John.

19:40.136 --> 19:41.400
- John.
- Yeah.

19:41.402 --> 19:43.137
How 'bout that girl?

19:43.139 --> 19:46.005
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

19:46.007 --> 19:47.107
She left.

19:47.109 --> 19:50.077
- She was digging you, man.
- Yeah.

19:50.079 --> 19:52.079
Yeah. Take you home,

19:52.081 --> 19:55.983
have a little sophisticated
L.A. sex.

19:55.985 --> 19:58.217
No, all she wanted to do
was talk about her colon.

19:58.219 --> 20:02.523
That's what all people in L.A.
talk about, their colons.

20:02.525 --> 20:04.858
And that's 'cause
they're all assholes.

20:04.860 --> 20:07.226
Yes. Where are you from?

20:07.228 --> 20:11.130
Ah, shit.
Turn that shit off, man!

20:11.132 --> 20:12.099
- Making me sick!
- What are you talking about?

20:12.101 --> 20:14.100
- Too much Dylan!
- Too much Dylan?

20:14.102 --> 20:16.203
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, the answer,

20:16.205 --> 20:17.571
- my friend, is blowin' in the wind.
- He's a poet, man!

20:17.573 --> 20:20.174
The answer, my friend,
is getting blown

20:20.176 --> 20:22.208
- In the wind
- You sound like an idiot.

20:22.210 --> 20:24.878
- What are you...
- The answer's getting blown

20:24.880 --> 20:26.946
In the wind.

20:26.948 --> 20:28.182
Guy's getting blown,

20:28.184 --> 20:30.149
and he's whining about it!

20:30.151 --> 20:32.285
He's not talking about
getting blown.

20:32.287 --> 20:36.523
- Getting blown in the wind, you fucking moron!
- I know!

20:36.525 --> 20:38.826
I was fucking with you!

20:41.897 --> 20:43.030
You think I don't know?

20:43.032 --> 20:44.831
Johnny, Johnny,

20:44.833 --> 20:46.567
listen to me, listen to me.

20:46.569 --> 20:48.534
Seriously.

20:48.536 --> 20:51.871
I know a party that's ten times
better than this shit-bag.

20:51.873 --> 20:55.274
Let's go there now.
There's ten times hotter babes.

20:55.276 --> 20:59.279
We plow the Milagro Beanfield.

21:01.483 --> 21:03.583
Huh? You and me.

21:03.585 --> 21:04.584
Come on.

21:04.586 --> 21:07.087
What a promise.

21:08.489 --> 21:12.091
I guess we thought
that "the babes"

21:12.093 --> 21:15.628
were fairer
on the other side of town.

21:15.630 --> 21:18.564
So I left Terry
and her friends,

21:18.566 --> 21:22.202
and we headed
to the next party.

21:22.204 --> 21:26.205
But not before we got
even more wasted.

21:26.207 --> 21:28.274
Hey. Clink it.

21:31.045 --> 21:33.280
Keep 'em comin', bro!

21:34.582 --> 21:36.052
Oh.

21:38.053 --> 21:39.919
Some people tell me I look like Burt Reynolds.

21:39.921 --> 21:41.288
I don't see it.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.189
Do you see it?

21:43.191 --> 21:45.591
- Yeah. I do.
- Thank you.

21:45.593 --> 21:47.593
- You're a sexy man.
- Thank you, man!

21:47.595 --> 21:50.196
You're a sexy man.

21:50.198 --> 21:52.666
Can you keep 'em comin'?
I don't want to say it.

21:55.271 --> 21:58.605
I know you got a lot of people
up and down to take care of,

21:58.607 --> 22:00.573
but 'member
who the main customer...

22:00.575 --> 22:02.642
How 'bout the whole bottle?

22:02.644 --> 22:04.911
How 'bout the whole bottle?

22:04.913 --> 22:06.914
How 'bout the whole bottle?

22:06.916 --> 22:09.249
Is that good enough?

22:09.251 --> 22:11.651
- Hey. Don't get sad.
- No.

22:11.653 --> 22:13.222
There's so many more.

22:15.623 --> 22:18.358
Keep 'em comin', bro.
We talked about this.

22:23.198 --> 22:25.564
Take the wheel.

22:27.236 --> 22:29.202
I'm back.

22:30.572 --> 22:32.140
Wash it down?

22:36.277 --> 22:38.344
Guess who you're driving with.

22:38.346 --> 22:41.982
I'm the cunnilingus king
of Orange County, man.

22:41.984 --> 22:45.017
I just love yodeling into it.

22:48.223 --> 22:51.390
Oh, shit!
That's Scott's Adventure Land!

22:51.392 --> 22:53.426
That's Scott's Adventure Land!

22:53.428 --> 22:55.728
What's
Scott's Adventure Land?

22:55.730 --> 22:57.164
You never been
to Scott's Adventure Land?

22:57.166 --> 22:58.665
I never been to...
Let's go there.

22:58.667 --> 23:00.300
Make a U-turn.

23:00.302 --> 23:02.601
Just fucking jump
over the wall, man.

23:20.221 --> 23:23.125
Oh, yeah. Oh, God.

23:27.196 --> 23:28.264
Draw!

23:29.398 --> 23:31.197
Oh, really?

23:31.199 --> 23:32.666
Don't be a fool, buddy.

23:32.668 --> 23:35.438
You just tussled
with the wrong cowboy.

23:39.240 --> 23:41.340
You son of a...

23:41.342 --> 23:43.342
No!

23:43.344 --> 23:45.180
No!

23:55.423 --> 23:57.657
- My car, I drive.
- You're in no condition to drive, my friend.

23:57.659 --> 23:59.458
- My car, I drive.
- I'm gonna take the fucking keys.

23:59.460 --> 24:02.294
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm gonna take the fucking keys.

24:02.296 --> 24:04.296
- You guys are in no condition to drive!
- Aah!

24:21.350 --> 24:23.719
Babes.

24:43.304 --> 24:45.237
<i>And that was it.</i>

24:45.239 --> 24:49.810
<i>Dexter had mistaken a Con
Edison light pole for an exit</i>

24:49.812 --> 24:52.748
and slammed into it
at 90 miles an hour.

25:09.230 --> 25:12.232
Let me know
when you're ready. I think...

25:12.234 --> 25:14.736
On three. One, two, three.

25:20.309 --> 25:23.079
Hello, John. I'm Dr. Mirione.

25:26.215 --> 25:28.148
Bright, bright lights.

25:28.150 --> 25:30.349
Surprisingly noisy, isn't it?

25:30.351 --> 25:32.852
Well, there's very little
peace and quiet for the dying

25:32.854 --> 25:34.353
and nearly dying.

25:34.355 --> 25:36.322
I'm dying?

25:36.324 --> 25:39.292
The average survival time for
catastrophic patients here is 12 hours.

25:39.294 --> 25:43.295
Nasty accident you had
in that Volkswagen.

25:43.297 --> 25:44.464
I saw the car.

25:44.466 --> 25:48.368
Looks terrible.
Looked terrible.

25:50.272 --> 25:52.238
I can't hear you. Talk louder.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.808
What happened to the driver?

25:54.810 --> 25:56.342
What happened to Dexter?

25:56.344 --> 25:57.577
Oh, Dexter Marzynski?

25:57.579 --> 26:00.246
He walked away
with a few scratches.

26:00.248 --> 26:01.784
He was very, very lucky.

26:03.784 --> 26:05.217
Jesus Christ.

26:05.219 --> 26:07.154
My heart really
goes out to you.

26:07.156 --> 26:09.625
I mean, possibly paralyzed
for life.

26:11.392 --> 26:13.426
Nice sunrise, though.

26:19.267 --> 26:22.505
<i>Susan Henry
to the nurses' station.</i>

27:15.256 --> 27:16.892
Hey.

27:18.326 --> 27:20.262
Let's see here.

27:22.264 --> 27:24.863
This is a C5, C6,

27:24.865 --> 27:28.267
which is a complete
cervical six lesion.

27:28.269 --> 27:30.236
Uh, good shoulder movement.

27:30.238 --> 27:33.305
Uh, complete paralysis
of the body and legs.

27:33.307 --> 27:34.474
No finger movement,
but good, uh...

27:34.476 --> 27:37.010
I'm not an imposter.

27:37.012 --> 27:39.346
- I'm a real quadriplegic.
- Spinal cord severed

27:39.348 --> 27:41.481
between the fifth
and sixth vertebrae,

27:41.483 --> 27:43.449
counting down from the top.

27:43.451 --> 27:46.886
Somewhere between decathlon
champion and rigor mortis.

27:46.888 --> 27:49.421
...half his deltoid,
half his, uh, diaphragm.

27:49.423 --> 27:52.658
But if he's not careful,
he can choke to death. Yeah.

27:52.660 --> 27:58.298
Uh, this patient over here is
a C4-5 neurologically intact.

27:58.300 --> 28:01.301
Uh, a tibia plateau fracture.

28:01.303 --> 28:04.372
Not as catastrophic an injury.

28:16.551 --> 28:18.717
Hi, John.

28:18.719 --> 28:20.355
My name is Annu.

28:21.523 --> 28:22.722
Wow.

28:22.724 --> 28:24.593
You're very good-looking.

28:34.002 --> 28:36.305
How are things
going here, John?

28:37.505 --> 28:40.040
It's bad.

28:40.042 --> 28:43.576
It's really bad.

28:43.578 --> 28:45.411
I can't move.

28:45.413 --> 28:47.946
I can't feel my body,
and where I can,

28:47.948 --> 28:50.349
it just hurts.

28:50.351 --> 28:52.686
I can't take a whiz
or anything.

28:52.688 --> 28:54.721
I just feel like
I'm going fucking crazy.

28:54.723 --> 28:56.322
Yeah.

28:56.324 --> 28:59.091
Yeah, it doesn't sound
like it's going too well.

28:59.093 --> 29:02.395
No, it doesn't.

29:02.397 --> 29:03.763
It's awful.

29:03.765 --> 29:06.369
I just don't even know
how I'm gonna, like...

29:08.003 --> 29:10.770
I don't know how I can live
any life after this.

29:10.772 --> 29:14.407
I just feel like
I'm not gonna have any future.

29:14.409 --> 29:16.642
And the doctors
don't tell me anything,

29:16.644 --> 29:21.447
but it looks like I'm just
gonna be like this for life.

29:21.449 --> 29:23.416
I can't understand this.

29:23.418 --> 29:25.385
Doesn't seem fair.

29:25.387 --> 29:29.022
John, you're a very
special person.

29:29.024 --> 29:31.524
I feel it.

29:32.361 --> 29:34.360
I brought you some flowers.

29:34.362 --> 29:36.428
I hope you like them.

29:36.430 --> 29:38.365
Thank you.

29:38.367 --> 29:39.802
Can I smell them?

29:44.706 --> 29:46.406
That's nice. Thank you.

29:46.408 --> 29:49.376
Would you like me
to rub your shoulders?

29:49.378 --> 29:51.547
Yes, please.

29:52.581 --> 29:54.613
It was a lovely day out.

29:54.615 --> 29:56.014
Very hot.

29:56.016 --> 29:58.385
Drove here in my convertible.

29:58.387 --> 30:01.388
Do you really think
I'm good-looking?

30:01.390 --> 30:04.157
Yes, you're very good-looking.
That hasn't changed.

30:04.159 --> 30:06.059
And you have
tremendous strength.

30:06.061 --> 30:09.428
You'll go on to have
a wonderful life. I can tell.

30:09.430 --> 30:11.766
I pray that I will.

30:13.401 --> 30:15.769
I make prayers to God,
you know.

30:15.771 --> 30:18.737
I remember
all the promises to God

30:18.739 --> 30:23.542
and pacts with the devil
made by characters in Dickens

30:23.544 --> 30:27.147
or, like, "Rosemary's Baby,"

30:27.149 --> 30:30.617
to, you know, like, change
history and make things better

30:30.619 --> 30:32.685
or escape horrible fates.

30:32.687 --> 30:36.488
And what do you say to God?

30:36.490 --> 30:40.193
I say, "Please,
don't let me be paralyzed."

30:40.195 --> 30:42.195
I just can't be paralyzed.

30:42.197 --> 30:44.597
Things work out
for John Callahan.

30:44.599 --> 30:47.199
I'm just not one of the ones
who ends up paralyzed.

30:47.201 --> 30:49.104
I just can't be.

30:50.639 --> 30:53.676
And what about when you're
talking to the devil, John?

30:56.178 --> 30:59.446
I say, "I'll give you anything.

30:59.448 --> 31:03.582
Anything you want,
just change this."

31:03.584 --> 31:05.420
And you're from Oregon?

31:06.521 --> 31:08.487
That's your home?

31:08.489 --> 31:09.722
Yes.

31:09.724 --> 31:11.827
Yes. The...

31:13.195 --> 31:15.164
The Dalles.

31:22.603 --> 31:24.704
It's sort of a hick town.

31:28.810 --> 31:31.477
We're a bunch of gomers.

31:31.479 --> 31:34.112
Gomers? What is "gomers"?

31:34.114 --> 31:38.184
I like how you say it.
"Gomers."

31:39.720 --> 31:42.187
I don't know.
I think it just...

31:42.189 --> 31:44.256
you know, it, like, means
you're from the country.

31:44.258 --> 31:46.192
It's derogatory.

31:46.194 --> 31:47.760
Ah.

31:47.762 --> 31:49.561
Where are you from?

31:49.563 --> 31:51.196
From Stockholm.

31:51.198 --> 31:53.699
There's a lot of fishing there,
lots of salmon.

31:53.701 --> 31:55.570
Oh, same with The Dalles.

31:57.605 --> 32:00.205
- Yeah?
- Yeah, lots of salmon.

32:00.207 --> 32:02.175
Now we have something
in common.

32:02.177 --> 32:04.944
I think we have
a lot in common, John.

32:04.946 --> 32:06.913
Yeah. Salmon.

32:06.915 --> 32:08.918
And we're both gomers.

32:10.685 --> 32:12.284
And what else, John?

32:12.286 --> 32:13.956
I look at the sunrise.

32:15.623 --> 32:17.890
- The sunrise is nice.
- Mm-hmm.

32:17.892 --> 32:21.261
It's very calming.

32:21.263 --> 32:23.466
I've been watching
the gymnasts out there.

32:37.312 --> 32:39.678
I have to go to my next
appointment now, John.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.680
But I'll be seeing
you again soon.

32:41.682 --> 32:43.818
- When?
- One day next week.

32:45.754 --> 32:48.186
Very nice to meet you, John.

32:48.188 --> 32:50.223
I like meeting you, too, Annu.

32:50.225 --> 32:53.560
Thank you.
Thank you for my flowers.

32:53.562 --> 32:54.929
See you soon.

32:56.331 --> 32:57.900
Bye.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.738
I'm glad I met Annu.

33:06.740 --> 33:09.708
What about us, John?
Aren't you glad you met us?

33:09.710 --> 33:11.311
John doesn't like us.

33:11.313 --> 33:12.779
Well, of course I like you.

33:12.781 --> 33:15.281
I just can't get laid
with any of you.

33:15.283 --> 33:17.586
Have you tried?

33:19.787 --> 33:21.656
Well, have you tried?

33:23.291 --> 33:25.992
One, two and three.

33:25.994 --> 33:27.025
Here we go.

33:27.027 --> 33:28.594
All right.

33:28.596 --> 33:30.663
Adjust him on three.

33:30.665 --> 33:32.865
One, two, three.

33:32.867 --> 33:34.333
- There we go.
- There you go.

33:34.335 --> 33:35.637
All set.

33:39.707 --> 33:41.608
That's the power button
right here.

33:41.610 --> 33:43.279
Enjoy.

34:13.907 --> 34:15.677
Oh.

35:13.968 --> 35:15.734
Oh.

35:16.970 --> 35:18.738
Ah.

35:18.740 --> 35:20.338
Ah, nice shot.

35:20.340 --> 35:23.041
- Hey, man. How you doing?
- Pretty good. How you doing?

35:23.043 --> 35:25.343
Pretty good.
We're just shooting some hoops.

35:25.345 --> 35:26.812
Fucking "A."

35:26.814 --> 35:28.347
I'm John.

35:28.349 --> 35:30.885
- Charles-Marie. Welcome.
- Nice to meet you. Thanks.

35:41.863 --> 35:44.430
<i>Sexual
activity is an opportunity</i>

35:44.432 --> 35:46.399
<i>to get to know yourself again.</i>

35:46.401 --> 35:49.135
<i>It's an opportunity
to build confidence.</i>

35:49.137 --> 35:52.104
After your accident, John,
your body doesn't have

35:52.106 --> 35:54.407
ordinary psychogenic
erections anymore,

35:54.409 --> 35:57.744
so you have to use
reflexogenic erections.

35:57.746 --> 36:00.079
Reflexogenic erections.

36:00.081 --> 36:02.080
Sounds sexy.

36:02.082 --> 36:05.151
So, how would I go about
achieving that?

36:05.153 --> 36:07.186
- Can you demonstrate?
- Behave.

36:07.188 --> 36:09.088
Have you thought about

36:09.090 --> 36:10.823
asking that little nurse
of yours

36:10.825 --> 36:12.524
to sit on your face
some night, John?

36:12.526 --> 36:15.995
Hey, Lilly,
may I ask you a question?

36:15.997 --> 36:18.898
Sure, yeah.
Ask me anything. Anything.

36:18.900 --> 36:21.166
Can you sit on my face?

36:21.168 --> 36:27.140
That's a shocking
yet wildly exciting idea.

36:27.142 --> 36:28.508
But no. I mean...

36:28.510 --> 36:30.108
Would that be appropriate?

36:30.110 --> 36:32.410
Who cares if it's appropriate?

36:32.412 --> 36:33.845
John.

36:33.847 --> 36:35.183
You're thinking about it.

36:39.253 --> 36:41.189
Good night.

36:44.825 --> 36:45.992
Did you hear that?

36:45.994 --> 36:47.526
You scored.

36:47.528 --> 36:49.162
Not quite.

36:49.164 --> 36:51.196
She'll be back.

36:51.198 --> 36:53.099
My job's
to get you the erection.

36:53.101 --> 36:54.901
That's all I care about.

36:54.903 --> 36:57.202
Worse she could say is no,
and if she says no,

36:57.204 --> 36:59.872
then you come back and ask me.

36:59.874 --> 37:01.106
That's a deal.

37:01.108 --> 37:03.142
Reflexogenic simply means

37:03.144 --> 37:06.044
that it has to be
from the touch, okay?

37:06.046 --> 37:07.146
If she sits there...

37:08.148 --> 37:10.216
...the touch will stimulate

37:10.218 --> 37:14.153
blood flow to here,
hence causing an erection.

37:14.155 --> 37:17.122
Okay?

37:19.059 --> 37:21.193
- Really?
- But you can't just think about it.

37:21.195 --> 37:23.162
You can't just
imagine it anymore.

37:33.006 --> 37:34.140
- Are you feeling me?
- Yeah.

37:34.142 --> 37:35.908
That's where my dick
used to be.

37:41.182 --> 37:42.615
Pull it.

37:42.617 --> 37:45.084
I'm trying to get
further and further.

37:45.086 --> 37:47.019
And down.

37:47.021 --> 37:48.220
Can you do it?

37:48.222 --> 37:51.591
Annu, sometimes
I just want to drink.

37:51.593 --> 37:56.195
You know, it doesn't seem fair
that we can't have a drink.

37:56.197 --> 37:57.629
But, you know, we can go

37:57.631 --> 38:00.233
to Tiny's Tavern
on the weekends

38:00.235 --> 38:02.100
and drink as much as we want.

38:02.102 --> 38:03.635
Might give it to us for free,

38:03.637 --> 38:05.303
you know, 'cause
they feel bad for us.

38:05.305 --> 38:07.138
You know, we milk it.

38:10.311 --> 38:12.245
Oh, you're not gonna believe
what happened the other night.

38:12.247 --> 38:15.180
So, we're coming back
from Tiny's Tavern,

38:15.182 --> 38:17.916
me and Charles-Marie,
and we're crossing

38:17.918 --> 38:20.321
the railroad tracks
on our way back here.

38:21.889 --> 38:24.289
And Charles-Marie's chair
got stuck

38:24.291 --> 38:26.024
in the railroad tracks.

38:26.026 --> 38:27.329
Shit!

38:29.997 --> 38:32.999
And he said, "Let me die.

38:33.001 --> 38:35.635
Let me die.
It's better this way."

38:35.637 --> 38:38.137
Just let me die!
It's better this way!

38:38.139 --> 38:41.140
Grab on to my chair.
Grab on to my chair!

38:43.278 --> 38:45.912
And you know what's funny?

38:45.914 --> 38:48.013
He meant it.

38:48.015 --> 38:53.019
I think, in that moment,
he really wanted to die.

38:53.021 --> 38:54.921
That's not very funny, John.

38:54.923 --> 38:56.923
That sounds dangerous.

39:00.260 --> 39:02.197
All in a day of being a quad.

39:14.175 --> 39:15.240
Hello.

39:15.242 --> 39:17.276
Hey, uh, is this Donnie?

39:17.278 --> 39:19.111
Yeah, who's this?

39:19.113 --> 39:20.312
<i>Hey, Donnie,
this is John Callahan.</i>

39:20.314 --> 39:23.316
I'm the neon cripple
from outer space.

39:23.318 --> 39:25.184
Oh, the man
with the tangerine hair?

39:25.186 --> 39:29.055
Well, I always thought
of my hair as electric orange,

39:29.057 --> 39:30.622
but, yeah, that's me.

39:30.624 --> 39:34.026
<i>Uh, look, I got your number
off the board.</i>

39:34.028 --> 39:36.195
<i>I'm calling because</i>

39:36.197 --> 39:38.296
I need a sponsor.

39:38.298 --> 39:41.233
I do have a lot of piglets
at the moment.

39:41.235 --> 39:43.970
<i>What are piglets?
I need a sponsor.</i>

39:43.972 --> 39:45.338
My sponsees are piglets.

39:46.606 --> 39:48.274
That's funny.

39:48.276 --> 39:50.276
- <i>Wow.</i>
- You want me to help you get sober.

39:50.278 --> 39:53.079
Well, I saw you speak, and, uh,

39:53.081 --> 39:55.314
I really like
what you had to say

39:55.316 --> 39:57.249
<i>about the two pairs of pants
and the woman's...</i>

39:57.251 --> 39:59.318
See, John, I know. I just...

39:59.320 --> 40:01.120
<i>And I don't know
if you're serious.</i>

40:01.122 --> 40:02.187
Oh, Jesus Christ.

40:02.189 --> 40:03.222
Oh, I call him Chucky.

40:03.224 --> 40:05.124
What?

40:05.126 --> 40:07.059
<i>I don't know, John Callahan.
I don't...</i>

40:07.061 --> 40:08.394
I'm serious. I am serious.

40:08.396 --> 40:10.428
I... you know,
sometimes I just, I make jokes

40:10.430 --> 40:15.100
'cause I get nervous, but I'm,
I-I need, I need something.

40:15.102 --> 40:16.736
<i>You know...</i>

40:16.738 --> 40:21.273
every day,
like clockwork at 4:00 p.m.,

40:21.275 --> 40:24.010
I get massively depressed.

40:24.012 --> 40:26.111
<i>Well, I'm depressed
from the moment I wake up,</i>

40:26.113 --> 40:28.446
- so got you there.
- <i>Listen.</i>

40:28.448 --> 40:32.218
We're having a group talk,
my place on Saturday.

40:32.220 --> 40:33.686
<i>Why don't you drop by?</i>

40:33.688 --> 40:35.287
Ooh, a talk?

40:35.289 --> 40:36.722
<i>We'll talk about Chucky.</i>

40:36.724 --> 40:38.657
The other piglets
are coming by at 1:00.

40:38.659 --> 40:40.059
4014 Northwest Johnson.

40:40.061 --> 40:41.794
- <i>Don't be late.</i>
- Tim.

40:41.796 --> 40:43.294
4014 Northwest Johnson.

40:43.296 --> 40:45.363
- 1:00 p.m.
- Are you talking to me?

40:45.365 --> 40:47.666
- All right, thank you. I'll see you then.
- Okay.

40:47.668 --> 40:50.137
Drink water. Bye.

40:53.140 --> 40:54.407
40... Wait, what was it?

40:54.409 --> 40:56.776
- 4014 Southwest Johnson.
- Okay.

40:56.778 --> 40:59.412
Let's go.

40:59.414 --> 41:02.113
Hey, Sam, get back
and clean up this mess.

41:02.115 --> 41:04.216
And get out of here
and go grab some PT.

41:04.218 --> 41:06.318
You grab some PT.

41:06.320 --> 41:08.153
- Hi.
- Oh.

41:08.155 --> 41:09.187
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, sorry.

41:09.189 --> 41:10.222
- That's okay.
- Hi.

41:10.224 --> 41:11.490
Hi. I'm Debbie.

41:11.492 --> 41:13.792
- Hi, I'm John.
- Hi, what's up?

41:13.794 --> 41:15.193
Um, I'm gonna go out
to the park.

41:15.195 --> 41:17.195
- Do you want to come with me?
- Uh...

41:17.197 --> 41:19.832
fuck, today is Monday.

41:19.834 --> 41:21.466
- Fuck yeah.
- Yes?

41:21.468 --> 41:23.702
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you. Good, let's go.

- Oh...
- Tim thought it was Southwest.

42:49.789 --> 42:51.524
- Why'd you think Southwest?
- It's okay.

42:51.526 --> 42:53.425
Yeah, Southwest,
but we got here, didn't we?

42:53.427 --> 42:55.294
This is Reba,
who I think you've met.

42:55.296 --> 42:59.231
- Hello.
- Martingale, Corky, Hans, Mike.

42:59.233 --> 43:00.231
- Hi.
- Hello.

43:00.233 --> 43:01.367
Welcome.

43:01.369 --> 43:03.234
That's Tim.

43:03.236 --> 43:04.570
- Welcome, Tim.
- Tim.

43:04.572 --> 43:06.539
- Hi, Tim.
- Hello, Tim.

43:06.541 --> 43:09.374
And now that we're
getting all acquainted,

43:09.376 --> 43:10.876
how was everyone's week?

43:10.878 --> 43:12.244
Anybody want to speak?

43:12.246 --> 43:14.180
Um, I have something
to talk about.

43:14.182 --> 43:16.314
Oh, John, just so you know,
since you're new here,

43:16.316 --> 43:17.249
I'm a poet.

43:17.251 --> 43:19.318
A street poet.

43:19.320 --> 43:21.287
And a gay activist.

43:21.289 --> 43:23.622
So, I was
at the Pendleton Round-Up,

43:23.624 --> 43:27.193
and I took the opportunity
to read one of my poems,

43:27.195 --> 43:30.829
which has in it a number
of references to young cocks.

43:30.831 --> 43:32.830
This is it.

43:32.832 --> 43:35.367
"Hot...

43:35.369 --> 43:37.303
in the summer sun.

43:37.305 --> 43:41.273
Working all day, hustling hay.

43:41.275 --> 43:43.943
It's getting harder

43:43.945 --> 43:46.312
and harder

43:46.314 --> 43:48.247
and harder...

43:48.249 --> 43:51.450
ready to pop
out of their button fly.

43:51.452 --> 43:52.654
Pop!

43:53.653 --> 43:54.954
Pop!"

43:54.956 --> 43:57.323
We got it. Pop!

43:57.325 --> 44:00.358
- Pop! It's all about penises, please.
- Oh, stop.

44:00.360 --> 44:03.329
And just like that,
some cowboy stops me

44:03.331 --> 44:05.330
and says my poem is X-rated.

44:05.332 --> 44:07.899
And you don't think it was?

44:07.901 --> 44:09.468
No. It wasn't.

44:09.470 --> 44:11.570
It was a red-blooded,
American poem.

44:11.572 --> 44:13.472
All right.

44:13.474 --> 44:15.608
So, the cowboy tells me
to stop, and I say to him,

44:15.610 --> 44:18.611
"I'm an American
reading an American poem

44:18.613 --> 44:21.347
about an American institution."

44:21.349 --> 44:22.948
He didn't like that.

44:22.950 --> 44:25.283
He accused me of being drunk.

44:25.285 --> 44:28.553
I say to him, "I've been sober
now for three years.

44:28.555 --> 44:31.423
I'm a proud member of A.A."

44:31.425 --> 44:32.957
And I walked off.

44:32.959 --> 44:36.028
Anyone want to respond
to Martingale's story?

44:36.030 --> 44:38.930
Well, the poems make
straight guys angry.

44:38.932 --> 44:41.399
- I'm not angry, Hans.
- See?

44:41.401 --> 44:43.901
But here's the thing:
that kind of anger

44:43.903 --> 44:46.472
can get in the way
of your recovery.

44:46.474 --> 44:49.475
I think we can all agree
that being out there

44:49.477 --> 44:52.977
and having a good time...
not drinking, we get it...

44:52.979 --> 44:54.445
feels really good.

44:54.447 --> 44:56.582
But it's one thing
to read your poems

44:56.584 --> 44:58.383
in front of people
that you know

44:58.385 --> 45:00.419
in your Greek cafes
late at night,

45:00.421 --> 45:03.354
but it's another to read it in
front of rednecks at a rodeo.

45:03.356 --> 45:05.356
It's a little bit dangerous.

45:05.358 --> 45:07.026
- I think he was really brave.
- Mm.

45:07.028 --> 45:08.526
- Yeah, I do, too, Martingale.
- Yeah.

45:08.528 --> 45:10.361
- I mean, I...
- Fuck the rednecks, right?

45:10.363 --> 45:11.729
- That's right.
- Hey. I'm a mullet-haired redneck,

45:11.731 --> 45:13.332
and you know
I'll kick your ass.

45:13.334 --> 45:14.666
You know I can kick your ass.

45:14.668 --> 45:16.334
- John, any comments?
- What?

45:16.336 --> 45:17.572
John.

45:18.706 --> 45:20.571
What I want to know is,

45:20.573 --> 45:22.408
with all the poems
that you have,

45:22.410 --> 45:24.343
they can't all be
about penises.

45:24.345 --> 45:26.445
I mean, you probably got
some pretty ones, I'm sure.

45:26.447 --> 45:27.713
Well, what I believe

45:27.715 --> 45:31.450
is we all have led,
in our non-sober periods,

45:31.452 --> 45:33.352
somewhat chaotic lives.

45:33.354 --> 45:37.423
And I think there's
a very fine line between

45:37.425 --> 45:40.358
creating chaos
because of the adventure

45:40.360 --> 45:44.265
and creating chaos because
of the dependency on it.

45:45.532 --> 45:47.099
Now, John isn't
speaking very much,

45:47.101 --> 45:49.702
so perhaps he thinks
he's better than us.

45:49.704 --> 45:52.307
So, John, do you want
to tell us about your drinking?

45:54.108 --> 45:56.642
Oh.

45:56.644 --> 45:59.410
Is this... Do I say,
"John, I'm an alcoholic"?

45:59.412 --> 46:01.483
Just tell us
about your drinking.

46:04.385 --> 46:06.517
Um...

46:06.519 --> 46:08.454
Well, I, um,

46:08.456 --> 46:12.059
I started drinking
when I was, uh, 13.

46:14.095 --> 46:16.128
Um...

46:16.130 --> 46:20.535
I-I stole a bottle of gin
from my Aunt Diane.

46:21.635 --> 46:25.003
And, um, I liked it.

46:25.005 --> 46:27.439
A lot.

46:27.441 --> 46:29.010
And I never stopped.

46:30.443 --> 46:31.709
Okay.

46:31.711 --> 46:34.812
Um, yeah...

46:34.814 --> 46:36.615
Keep going.

46:36.617 --> 46:41.553
I mean, I-I kept drinking,
I guess,

46:41.555 --> 46:44.390
maybe because I was adopted.

46:44.392 --> 46:46.392
I was adopted.

46:46.394 --> 46:49.026
And, um,

46:49.028 --> 46:52.530
maybe it made me
not care as much about that.

46:52.532 --> 46:55.401
Or...

46:55.403 --> 46:57.135
Yeah.

46:57.137 --> 46:59.405
I-I don't, I don't really know.

46:59.407 --> 47:02.508
- Yeah...
- Corky drank 'cause her name is Corky.

47:05.613 --> 47:07.845
I drank 'cause my shoes
were too tight.

47:07.847 --> 47:09.847
You know,

47:09.849 --> 47:12.417
I'm glad you find this amusing.

47:12.419 --> 47:13.718
John, what we're trying
to point out

47:13.720 --> 47:15.454
is that we all have excuses.

47:15.456 --> 47:17.856
I resent you characterizing

47:17.858 --> 47:20.492
such a painful part
of my childhood,

47:20.494 --> 47:23.398
such as being an orphan,
as an excuse.

47:24.697 --> 47:28.834
I mean,
it is a fact, among others.

47:28.836 --> 47:30.836
Like, for instance,
I can't move

47:30.838 --> 47:32.671
one fucking muscle
below my chest.

47:32.673 --> 47:34.807
Would that qualify as an excuse?

47:34.809 --> 47:38.142
- What are you laughing at?
- We were waiting for that.

47:38.144 --> 47:40.445
We just knew you were gonna
say that, that's all.

47:40.447 --> 47:42.146
- You fucking cow!
- Oh.

47:42.148 --> 47:43.682
You wouldn't know pain
if it crawled up

47:43.684 --> 47:45.149
your fucking ass
and devoured you!

47:45.151 --> 47:46.218
How dare you!

47:46.220 --> 47:48.187
I'm sorry.
Well...

47:50.157 --> 47:53.827
...as a matter of fact,
I have cancer of the heart.

47:57.164 --> 47:58.863
And just let me
tell you something

47:58.865 --> 48:01.166
about your "poor me" s, okay?

48:01.168 --> 48:03.535
You keep it up,
"poor me, poor me,"

48:03.537 --> 48:05.102
and you're gonna
find yourself saying,

48:05.104 --> 48:06.738
- "Pour me another drink."
- Mm.

48:06.740 --> 48:09.140
And for the record,

48:09.142 --> 48:12.644
when I first came here,
I was a fat, worthless cow.

48:12.646 --> 48:14.646
But I worked these 12 steps,

48:14.648 --> 48:17.548
and I carved out a little bit
of a life for myself.

48:17.550 --> 48:19.486
I'm sorry, Reba.

48:20.753 --> 48:22.153
I'm sorry, everybody.

48:22.155 --> 48:23.921
- It's okay.
- It's expected.

48:23.923 --> 48:27.225
It's okay, John.

48:27.227 --> 48:30.762
You're right on schedule,
sweetheart.

48:30.764 --> 48:32.564
And I'm glad you're here.
I want to tell you that.

48:32.566 --> 48:34.836
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you're here.

48:41.242 --> 48:43.274
I like you guys.

48:43.276 --> 48:46.245
You're fucking crazy.

48:49.517 --> 48:51.517
We like you, too, man.

48:51.519 --> 48:53.651
Well, wait till
you get to know me.

49:39.300 --> 49:40.566
Hey, bro.

49:40.568 --> 49:42.901
Shot of that wine?

49:42.903 --> 49:46.338
Goddamn it, I haven't even had
my first fucking drink.

49:46.340 --> 49:48.774
There's one
in my right shirt pocket here.

49:48.776 --> 49:51.044
The jacket here. Go get it.
It's another quart.

50:04.825 --> 50:06.291
Okay, great.

50:06.293 --> 50:08.026
Thanks, now.

50:08.028 --> 50:10.595
Mr. Katz will see you.

50:10.597 --> 50:12.266
Oh, thank you.

50:19.974 --> 50:21.640
Afternoon.

50:21.642 --> 50:23.041
Good afternoon.

50:23.043 --> 50:25.644
Thanks so much for taking
the time to see me.

50:25.646 --> 50:27.312
Not at all.

50:27.314 --> 50:29.981
- What can I do for you?
- My name is John Callahan.

50:29.983 --> 50:33.651
I was born in 1950 at the old
Saint Vincent's Hospital.

50:33.653 --> 50:36.021
I know three things
about my real mother:

50:36.023 --> 50:38.689
she was Irish-American,
she had red hair,

50:38.691 --> 50:40.892
- she was a school teacher.
- Mm-hmm.

50:40.894 --> 50:43.361
Oh, yeah.
And she didn't want me.

50:43.363 --> 50:45.329
So, four things.

50:45.331 --> 50:47.064
Anyway, I was hoping
you could help me find her.

50:47.066 --> 50:52.771
I-I made this sketch of what
I think she might look like.

50:52.773 --> 50:55.309
Maybe it'll help you out.

50:59.046 --> 51:00.711
It's very nice.

51:00.713 --> 51:02.314
Callahan.

51:02.316 --> 51:03.814
Yeah, John.

51:03.816 --> 51:06.651
Old Saint Vincent's Hospital.

51:06.653 --> 51:08.922
Well... let's see.

51:17.097 --> 51:18.829
That's really my file?

51:18.831 --> 51:20.097
All right. This is the one.

51:20.099 --> 51:21.700
That's it? Let me look at it.

51:21.702 --> 51:23.838
Yeah, we'll go back over.

51:25.706 --> 51:27.842
All right.

51:34.814 --> 51:36.080
What's it say?

51:36.082 --> 51:38.086
Uh...

51:39.820 --> 51:41.753
Well, Mr. Callahan,
there's little I can do.

51:41.755 --> 51:43.421
Wait. No, you saw something.

51:43.423 --> 51:45.823
- Mr. Callahan. Mr. Callahan.
- What's in there? What'd you...

51:45.825 --> 51:47.358
The state of Oregon has a law.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.727
Forget the state of Oregon,
man. Come on.

51:49.729 --> 51:50.928
Mr. Callahan,
I could lose my job.

51:50.930 --> 51:53.097
- There's just nothing I can do.
- Wait, what does that say?

51:53.099 --> 51:55.800
Is that... is that
"Maggie Lynch"?

51:55.802 --> 51:57.102
- I can't say, Mr....
- Is that her name?

51:57.104 --> 51:59.104
- Maggie Lynch?
- Mr. Callahan, I can't say.

51:59.106 --> 52:00.972
What do you mean you can't say?
It's written down right there.

52:00.974 --> 52:02.340
I just saw it.
Is that her name, Maggie Lynch?

52:02.342 --> 52:05.142
Mr. Callahan, I am not
gonna lose my job.

52:05.144 --> 52:06.812
Screw your job, man.

52:06.814 --> 52:08.345
You've probably been
sitting behind this desk

52:08.347 --> 52:09.780
- for 25 fucking years.
- Mr. Callahan,

52:09.782 --> 52:10.881
- get out.
- You have a miserable life.

52:10.883 --> 52:12.050
- Be a man!
- Get out.

52:12.052 --> 52:14.021
Aw, go fuck yourself.

52:30.503 --> 52:33.140
Maybe it's your battery
or a connection or something.

52:34.108 --> 52:36.207
There you are.

52:36.209 --> 52:38.175
- Could you spare a quarter?
- Yeah.

52:38.177 --> 52:41.113
234...

52:41.115 --> 52:43.217
2459.

52:45.151 --> 52:46.151
Here you go.

52:46.153 --> 52:47.818
Thank you, sir.

52:47.820 --> 52:49.454
You bet.

52:49.456 --> 52:51.055
<i>Disability Resource Center.</i>

52:51.057 --> 52:52.157
Hey, it's John.

52:52.159 --> 52:54.191
<i>Just a moment.</i>

52:55.461 --> 52:56.794
This is Suzanne.

52:56.796 --> 52:59.700
<i>Hey, Suzanne. It's John.</i>

53:00.767 --> 53:02.399
My chair broke down.

53:02.401 --> 53:05.003
- Could somebody come down here to help me?
- <i>John?</i>

53:05.005 --> 53:06.805
John, this is the third time

53:06.807 --> 53:08.173
in a couple of months
this has happened.

53:08.175 --> 53:09.508
You know, we have cutbacks

53:09.510 --> 53:11.209
ever since the
new president came in.

53:11.211 --> 53:13.879
- <i>We have our own problems.</i>
- Oh, please don't start.

53:13.881 --> 53:16.013
Please don't start.
Suzanne...

53:16.015 --> 53:18.850
<i>John, I'm sorry,
I do not make the rules.</i>

53:18.852 --> 53:20.852
What did I do to you?

53:20.854 --> 53:23.120
What did I do
to piss you off so much?!

53:23.122 --> 53:24.990
- Why you got to treat me like this?
- <i>You know,</i>

53:24.992 --> 53:27.091
I hear you're putting a lot
more mileage on that wheelchair

53:27.093 --> 53:28.260
than the average quadriplegic.

53:28.262 --> 53:30.227
Yeah, because
I'm an active worker!

53:30.229 --> 53:32.863
I'm not a fucking
nursing home vegetable!

53:32.865 --> 53:35.100
So I'm just asking for
a little bit of goddamn help!

53:35.102 --> 53:36.901
- Take care, John.
- <i>Suzanne,</i>

53:36.903 --> 53:39.070
please, please,
I fucking beg you.

53:39.072 --> 53:41.506
- I ask for forgiveness!
- Take care of yourself, please.

53:41.508 --> 53:42.843
<i>Please, please!</i>

53:53.586 --> 53:55.519
One of
the objectives of group

53:55.521 --> 53:58.957
is to provoke a new awareness
to unwanted

53:58.959 --> 54:03.128
or unnecessary emotional
problems that we sit with.

54:03.130 --> 54:04.963
And left unprovoked,

54:04.965 --> 54:07.032
we sit alone
with these problems,

54:07.034 --> 54:10.901
and they can fester into...
drinking habits,

54:10.903 --> 54:13.171
drug habits, gambling.

54:13.173 --> 54:15.573
Other bad habits.

54:15.575 --> 54:17.142
What are "other bad habits"?

54:17.144 --> 54:19.044
I mean, it could be anything.

54:19.046 --> 54:22.613
It could be hoarding,
bank robbing, suicide.

54:22.615 --> 54:24.182
It happens, amiga.

54:24.184 --> 54:25.916
Mike.

54:25.918 --> 54:28.253
Why don't you tell us
your story.

54:28.255 --> 54:30.588
Talk about your employment;
start from the beginning.

54:30.590 --> 54:32.090
What was the name
of the company?

54:32.092 --> 54:33.624
Uh...

54:33.626 --> 54:36.894
Burnside Exploratory
Systems Technology.

54:36.896 --> 54:38.629
And we called it BEST
for short.

54:38.631 --> 54:40.599
I, uh...

54:40.601 --> 54:44.501
had an administrator there
I didn't care for very much.

54:44.503 --> 54:46.271
Once a war going on,
and she didn't care

54:46.273 --> 54:48.173
whether we were winning
or losing when I worked there,

54:48.175 --> 54:49.908
and we were handed
a lot of bullshit.

54:49.910 --> 54:51.609
Slow down, Mike. Y-You...

54:51.611 --> 54:55.046
- "She," meaning your administrator?
- Yeah.

54:55.048 --> 54:56.981
Yeah, and she...

54:56.983 --> 55:01.051
would just keep to herself
up in her cubicle.

55:01.053 --> 55:02.954
Then we'd hear
her prerecorded voice

55:02.956 --> 55:04.655
come over the loudspeaker.

55:04.657 --> 55:08.158
Can you tell us a little bit
about this administrator?

55:08.160 --> 55:10.294
Yeah.
Yeah, well, first the sentry

55:10.296 --> 55:12.963
in our, uh, attack unit was...

55:12.965 --> 55:14.901
Uh, fuck.

55:15.968 --> 55:17.669
I'm sorry, Donnie, can we, uh,

55:17.671 --> 55:19.336
can we talk about
something else?

55:19.338 --> 55:20.638
No.

55:20.640 --> 55:22.173
How did she make you feel?

55:22.175 --> 55:24.209
Well, we were like family.

55:24.211 --> 55:26.912
You know, you spend enough time
with your family, you...

55:26.914 --> 55:29.981
end up wanting to strangle
your mom, you know?

55:29.983 --> 55:31.349
May I ask something?

55:31.351 --> 55:33.117
Go ahead, Corky.

55:33.119 --> 55:35.255
Were there any women
in your operation?

55:36.222 --> 55:37.622
Yeah.

55:37.624 --> 55:39.894
The administrator,
but we never saw her.

55:41.160 --> 55:44.562
I'm curious why there's a lack
of women in your stories.

55:44.564 --> 55:48.566
In your childhood, growing up,

55:48.568 --> 55:50.334
in your company.

55:50.336 --> 55:54.041
There must have been women
in your command unit.

55:57.311 --> 55:59.176
Because women
can't handle it over there!

55:59.178 --> 56:01.079
- Hey! Hey!
- Okay? Let me tell you,

56:01.081 --> 56:02.713
- neither of you would've
- Hey!

56:02.715 --> 56:04.182
- lasted two fucking seconds over there!
- Hey!

56:04.184 --> 56:07.619
- Mike, hey! Hey.
- Mike. Mike.

56:07.621 --> 56:09.220
- This is group.
- Yeah.

56:09.222 --> 56:11.289
Martingale, sit down.
Mike, sit down,

56:11.291 --> 56:13.158
or you'll be thrown
out of the group.

56:13.160 --> 56:16.093
I'm sorry.

56:16.095 --> 56:18.729
- You all take this so seriously.
- I'm sorry, Donnie.

56:18.731 --> 56:20.731
If you just went down
to Saint Luke's Church

56:20.733 --> 56:23.200
on Sunday services, I'm pretty
sure you'd be able to find

56:23.202 --> 56:25.135
the salvation
that you're looking for.

56:25.137 --> 56:27.305
Tim, you are very fucking cute.

56:27.307 --> 56:30.611
Now shut the fuck up,
'cause no one asked you, okay?

56:32.111 --> 56:34.178
Everyone, breathe.

56:34.180 --> 56:35.650
Mike, you okay?

56:37.084 --> 56:38.383
Tim, you think you can
pull my pants down

56:38.385 --> 56:40.621
so I don't have to speak
through my fucking fly?

56:46.727 --> 56:49.096
There you go, buddy.

56:53.332 --> 56:56.001
Hey, you forgot to open the bottle!

56:56.003 --> 56:57.669
Tim!

56:57.671 --> 57:00.107
Don't lock the door! Tim!

57:11.651 --> 57:13.287
Oh, fuck.

57:15.689 --> 57:17.321
Bet you could open
this bottle, Snickers.

57:17.323 --> 57:20.057
Fuck.

57:20.059 --> 57:22.262
No!

57:24.664 --> 57:26.133
Oh, fuck.

57:46.820 --> 57:49.490
Fuck. Fuck.

57:53.727 --> 57:55.463
Fuck!

58:22.856 --> 58:24.792
Oh.

58:29.796 --> 58:32.533
Oh, God, you son of a bitch.

59:18.410 --> 59:22.082
Please, please,
please, please, please.

01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:11.298
Snickers!

01:00:27.514 --> 01:00:29.550
Mom.

01:00:35.889 --> 01:00:38.159
Where are you?

01:00:39.892 --> 01:00:41.992
You fucker.

01:00:41.994 --> 01:00:44.230
You tart.

01:00:47.666 --> 01:00:50.336
You left me here.

01:00:52.372 --> 01:00:54.842
I'm a cripple.

01:00:57.711 --> 01:01:00.481
Where are you?

01:01:19.633 --> 01:01:22.503
<i>You are a good person, John.</i>

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:27.972
<i>You can help yourself.</i>

01:01:27.974 --> 01:01:29.640
<i>You can stop drinking,</i>

01:01:29.642 --> 01:01:34.379
<i>and you can become
happy and healthy.</i>

01:01:34.381 --> 01:01:36.580
<i>I know you're calling for me.</i>

01:01:36.582 --> 01:01:38.651
<i>I love you.</i>

01:01:42.454 --> 01:01:45.390
<i>Just please
don't call me a tart.</i>

01:01:57.003 --> 01:01:59.240
Hi, Tim.

01:02:00.439 --> 01:02:02.307
Something...

01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:05.713
really profound
just happened to me, man.

01:02:07.347 --> 01:02:09.546
Yeah, that's, uh...

01:02:09.548 --> 01:02:11.349
that's great.

01:02:11.351 --> 01:02:13.684
I don't think
I'm gonna drink anymore.

01:02:13.686 --> 01:02:16.289
You mind if I have
some of these cookies?

01:02:18.691 --> 01:02:20.358
Can I?

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.693
Yeah, man.

01:02:21.695 --> 01:02:23.428
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:25.363
What the fuck happened in here?
It's a wreck.

01:02:25.365 --> 01:02:26.798
What... where's Snickers?

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.432
I mean,
there's really no reason

01:02:28.434 --> 01:02:30.568
why you should believe me.

01:02:33.006 --> 01:02:35.372
Donnie, why do you
call them piglets?

01:02:35.374 --> 01:02:38.041
'Cause I'm a triple Aries,
Callahan.

01:02:38.043 --> 01:02:40.046
And 'cause they let me.

01:02:42.048 --> 01:02:43.580
See you.

01:02:43.582 --> 01:02:46.350
And 'cause a piglet
is a small, timid animal

01:02:46.352 --> 01:02:47.651
who tries to be brave

01:02:47.653 --> 01:02:50.120
and occasionally
conquers his fears.

01:02:50.122 --> 01:02:52.055
Look, there's just four things:

01:02:52.057 --> 01:02:54.358
keep going to meetings;
read this book I'm giving you;

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:57.028
don't drink; and if you think
you're gonna drink,

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:59.300
call me first, never after.

01:03:41.073 --> 01:03:42.874
<i>Last two weeks,</i>

01:03:42.876 --> 01:03:47.044
we were talking about
art and craft.

01:03:47.046 --> 01:03:48.678
All art has craft.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:51.048
All craft has art.

01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:55.553
But craft seeks
full perfection.

01:03:55.555 --> 01:03:58.423
And art seeks full expression.

01:03:58.425 --> 01:04:00.725
That's why...

01:04:00.727 --> 01:04:04.162
the craftsman's job is
every time always the same.

01:04:04.164 --> 01:04:05.733
Repeat every time.

01:04:08.668 --> 01:04:12.106
That's why we don't have
two "Mona Lisa."

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.508
And "Mona Lisa,"
by the way, one can say

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:19.843
is a controlled accident.

01:04:19.845 --> 01:04:21.678
<i>While working through the steps</i>

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.146
<i>of the fellowship,</i>

01:04:23.148 --> 01:04:26.818
I began to feel
a huge rush of energy.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:30.454
I suddenly realized
that I had been,

01:04:30.456 --> 01:04:32.155
<i>or should have been,</i>

01:04:32.157 --> 01:04:35.094
<i>a cartoonist, a gagman,
all along.</i>

01:05:47.233 --> 01:05:49.236
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:06:22.235 --> 01:06:24.602
I refer to my higher power
as Chucky,

01:06:24.604 --> 01:06:26.336
when the word "God"
doesn't suffice.

01:06:26.338 --> 01:06:29.573
You know, like the character
from the horror movie.

01:06:29.575 --> 01:06:33.843
Not because I'm terrified
of my higher power.

01:06:33.845 --> 01:06:39.249
It's 'cause I find my
higher power is unpredictable.

01:06:39.251 --> 01:06:42.986
The thing for you to grasp,
my little piglets,

01:06:42.988 --> 01:06:45.622
is that we don't control
the universe.

01:06:45.624 --> 01:06:49.026
And, in fact,
it will go on in our absence.

01:06:49.028 --> 01:06:50.894
We can't ask for help

01:06:50.896 --> 01:06:53.263
if we don't think there's
anyone out there to give it.

01:06:53.265 --> 01:06:56.033
You have to grasp this concept.

01:06:56.035 --> 01:06:59.035
And that doesn't have to be
fucking Jesus Christ

01:06:59.037 --> 01:07:01.305
or Buddha or Vanna White.

01:07:01.307 --> 01:07:04.774
So, can I choose the genitalia
of Raquel Welch?

01:07:04.776 --> 01:07:07.044
I would advise against that,
Callahan.

01:07:07.046 --> 01:07:08.345
Why?

01:07:08.347 --> 01:07:10.814
'Cause it's not a fucking joke.

01:07:10.816 --> 01:07:12.850
If you can't look
outside yourself

01:07:12.852 --> 01:07:15.889
and you can't find
a higher power, you're fucked.

01:07:17.724 --> 01:07:19.055
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Donnie.

01:07:19.057 --> 01:07:20.925
- Of course.
- See you, John.

01:07:20.927 --> 01:07:23.361
- Bye, John.
- Bye, Hans.

01:07:23.363 --> 01:07:26.062
Beat yourself
with a feather, not a bat.

01:07:28.267 --> 01:07:30.003
Be outside.
I'm gonna have a smoke.

01:07:31.671 --> 01:07:33.269
Don't linger
too long on belief.

01:07:33.271 --> 01:07:34.738
Just jump in, do the work.

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:37.408
Trust God. Clean house.

01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:38.979
Take this book.

01:07:40.079 --> 01:07:42.379
Lao-Tzu. Check it out.

01:07:42.381 --> 01:07:45.686
There's some valuable
proverbs in there.

01:07:47.387 --> 01:07:49.022
'Kay.

01:07:50.356 --> 01:07:52.390
Um, you need any information?

01:07:52.392 --> 01:07:55.091
Yeah, can you take a look
at this cartoon for me?

01:07:55.093 --> 01:07:57.727
- Give me your thoughts.
- Yeah, let me...

01:07:57.729 --> 01:07:59.729
Let's see.

01:08:03.403 --> 01:08:05.301
Mm.

01:08:05.303 --> 01:08:07.405
- It's pretty good. Pretty...
- I can tell you don't like it.

01:08:07.407 --> 01:08:09.707
Here, look at another one.

01:08:11.376 --> 01:08:12.979
Let's see.

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:22.752
You like that.

01:08:22.754 --> 01:08:24.020
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:08:24.022 --> 01:08:25.721
That's good.

01:08:25.724 --> 01:08:27.756
- Yeah, that's one of my favorites.
- Yeah.

01:08:27.759 --> 01:08:30.394
- Aw, thank you.
- Very good.

01:08:30.395 --> 01:08:32.666
Hey. Annu?

01:08:34.166 --> 01:08:36.335
- John?
- Is that you?

01:08:37.469 --> 01:08:40.904
Look at you.

01:08:40.906 --> 01:08:43.038
You're looking very handsome.

01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:44.341
Oh.

01:08:44.343 --> 01:08:46.142
How have you been?

01:08:46.144 --> 01:08:47.778
Good. I mean...

01:08:47.779 --> 01:08:49.180
God, you look beautiful.

01:08:49.182 --> 01:08:51.148
What-what is this?

01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:53.450
Oh, I have a new job now.
I work for Air Scandinavia.

01:08:53.452 --> 01:08:56.352
Wow, "Air Scandi-nah-via."

01:08:56.354 --> 01:08:57.854
Really something.

01:08:57.857 --> 01:08:59.390
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:08:59.392 --> 01:09:01.825
I was promoted.
I'm group captain now.

01:09:01.827 --> 01:09:03.493
- Group captain.
- Mm.

01:09:03.495 --> 01:09:05.828
Wow, yeah, so you're just up
in, uh, first class

01:09:05.831 --> 01:09:08.363
- with all the hot businessmen?
- Yeah.

01:09:08.366 --> 01:09:09.966
- Yeah.
- But I don't really like them.

01:09:09.969 --> 01:09:12.102
Are-are you...
are you flying out?

01:09:12.104 --> 01:09:13.870
Are you in town for a while?

01:09:13.872 --> 01:09:15.138
Do you, do you want to
get something to eat?

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:16.841
Yeah, I'm on layover.

01:09:16.843 --> 01:09:18.508
- Really?
- That'd be really nice.

01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:22.178
Yeah, well, let's find a place
to, you know...

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.417
"layover."

01:09:26.085 --> 01:09:27.417
"Let me put it this way,

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.154
don't buy
any hacky sack balls."

01:09:30.156 --> 01:09:31.821
That's really funny.

01:09:31.823 --> 01:09:33.390
- It's you. Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:09:33.392 --> 01:09:35.059
Wait, are you... you-you
really think it's funny?

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:37.130
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:10:13.064 --> 01:10:15.067
I'm gonna, I'm gonna come.

01:10:17.236 --> 01:10:18.968
I'm coming!

01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:20.904
- I'm coming!
- Oh, Jesus!

01:10:20.906 --> 01:10:23.106
Oh! Jesus Christ! John, I'm...

01:10:23.108 --> 01:10:25.909
I'm so sorry.
God, I am so sorry.

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.513
You have to promise

01:10:30.515 --> 01:10:32.882
that Tim will walk in
to serve breakfast

01:10:32.884 --> 01:10:34.885
at the same time every morning.

01:10:34.887 --> 01:10:36.220
Okay.

01:11:28.139 --> 01:11:30.341
Donnie, I see gymnasts
in the park.

01:11:30.343 --> 01:11:34.511
Mm. Maybe they're preparing
for the Olympics next year.

01:11:34.513 --> 01:11:36.247
I'm fucking serious.

01:11:36.249 --> 01:11:38.582
I've been seeing them
since my physical recovery.

01:11:38.584 --> 01:11:41.185
Oh, maybe
they're manifestations

01:11:41.187 --> 01:11:42.619
of your sobriety.

01:11:42.621 --> 01:11:44.888
We first saw them
in the emergency ward.

01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:47.291
Maybe they're sticking around
to get what they want.

01:11:47.293 --> 01:11:49.627
Well, what the fuck
do they want?

01:11:49.629 --> 01:11:51.928
For you to come with them.

01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:54.565
Yeah. Where to?

01:11:54.567 --> 01:11:57.901
'Cause they're waving to me,
you know?

01:11:57.903 --> 01:11:59.602
To the big park in the sky.

01:11:59.604 --> 01:12:02.006
They could be calling
from the other side.

01:12:02.008 --> 01:12:04.275
Yeah, that's
what I'm afraid of.

01:12:04.277 --> 01:12:06.910
I don't want to go
to the park in the sky.

01:12:06.912 --> 01:12:09.646
Callahan, don't obsess
over the gymnasts.

01:12:09.648 --> 01:12:12.548
Go to meetings, don't drink,
read the book.

01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:14.685
That's all
you have to focus on.

01:12:14.687 --> 01:12:16.986
And you have to work on
the second step.

01:12:16.988 --> 01:12:19.222
Like, you have to believe that
a power greater than yourself

01:12:19.224 --> 01:12:21.894
can restore you to sanity.

01:12:22.661 --> 01:12:25.229
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:25.231 --> 01:12:27.096
I know, I know, I know.

01:12:27.098 --> 01:12:30.935
And besides, how are you gonna
do gymnastics anyway, Callahan?

01:12:32.638 --> 01:12:35.138
- Honestly.
- Oh, that's so funny.

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.675
Oh, tomorrow
I fly to New York City

01:12:37.677 --> 01:12:39.275
to get my boogie on.

01:12:39.277 --> 01:12:41.244
Yeah, good for you, man.

01:12:41.246 --> 01:12:43.579
- You deserve it.
- Thank you.

01:12:43.581 --> 01:12:46.984
So, will I be able
to reach you, though?

01:12:51.323 --> 01:12:53.157
You drew this?

01:12:53.159 --> 01:12:54.591
Yeah. Oh, which one's that?
I mean, yeah,

01:12:54.593 --> 01:12:57.026
I drew 'em all, but...
Oh, yeah. That's my dad.

01:12:58.263 --> 01:13:01.164
This is good stuff, man.
This is really great.

01:13:03.035 --> 01:13:04.400
So...?

01:13:04.402 --> 01:13:06.636
You got it, man.
We'd like to give you a panel.

01:13:06.638 --> 01:13:08.073
Really?

01:13:16.348 --> 01:13:19.052
Hey, Officer,
take a look at this.

01:13:24.089 --> 01:13:25.321
Very nice.

01:13:25.323 --> 01:13:27.291
Very nice, right?
Thank you.

01:13:27.293 --> 01:13:29.325
- Hey.
- Hey, John. How are you, hon?

01:13:29.327 --> 01:13:31.361
Really good.
Take a look at this.

01:13:31.363 --> 01:13:33.133
What you got?

01:13:34.733 --> 01:13:38.103
Oh, hon. Lisa, look-it,
John's in the "Vanguard."

01:13:40.071 --> 01:13:42.138
Hmm.

01:13:44.442 --> 01:13:46.979
- Thank you.
- I like the shading.

01:13:47.746 --> 01:13:49.312
Okay.

01:13:49.314 --> 01:13:51.414
You want to see?
Look, puppy, look at that.

01:13:51.416 --> 01:13:53.085
- You drew that?
- Yeah.

01:13:58.023 --> 01:14:00.123
That's offensive.

01:14:00.125 --> 01:14:01.994
Offensive?

01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:07.131
Hey, some fellow artists.

01:14:07.133 --> 01:14:09.132
Check this out.
Look at this.

01:14:09.134 --> 01:14:10.467
No, I'm not trying
to sell you anything.

01:14:10.469 --> 01:14:12.302
I just want you to look at...

01:14:12.304 --> 01:14:15.271
They published my cartoon,
you fuckers!

01:14:19.245 --> 01:14:21.481

01:14:26.786 --> 01:14:29.218

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.275
Hello?

01:14:51.277 --> 01:14:53.310
<i>I just can't fucking do this.</i>

01:14:53.312 --> 01:14:55.812
I'm gonna kill Tim.
I'm gonna kill my attendant.

01:14:55.814 --> 01:14:57.847
You know, Callahan,
you can't ask for help

01:14:57.849 --> 01:15:01.284
if you don't think there's
anyone out there to give it.

01:15:01.286 --> 01:15:03.220
Yeah, I'm asking you
for help, Donnie.

01:15:03.222 --> 01:15:05.788
- That's why I'm calling you.
- <i>Well, tough shit.</i>

01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:08.358
Donnie's on a plane to
New York City in half an hour.

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.127
And I'm not gonna
be back till Monday.

01:15:11.129 --> 01:15:13.363
There's this new gay disco
there called The Saint,

01:15:13.365 --> 01:15:15.364
<i>and I'm gonna be having
the time of my life</i>

01:15:15.366 --> 01:15:17.266
<i>with Howard Rosenman
and Andy Warhol,</i>

01:15:17.268 --> 01:15:19.269
- <i>getting discovered, so...</i>
- I don't give a fuck

01:15:19.271 --> 01:15:21.370
about your sex life, Donnie.

01:15:21.372 --> 01:15:23.474
<i>Tell me what to do.</i>

01:15:23.476 --> 01:15:26.142
What are the first three steps?

01:15:26.144 --> 01:15:27.778
Donnie, come on.

01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:29.182
That, one?

01:15:30.316 --> 01:15:32.248
One, that I'm powerless
over alcohol

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:34.284
and my life has
become unmanageable.

01:15:34.286 --> 01:15:36.352
<i>Two, I came to believe that
a power greater than myself</i>

01:15:36.354 --> 01:15:38.288
<i>can restore me to sanity.</i>

01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:40.490
And three, I made a decision
to turn my will and my life

01:15:40.492 --> 01:15:42.559
over to the care of God,
as I understand it.

01:15:42.561 --> 01:15:45.162
<i>So you believe
you're powerless?</i>

01:15:45.164 --> 01:15:46.797
Yeah.

01:15:46.799 --> 01:15:48.364
You believe that a higher power

01:15:48.366 --> 01:15:50.199
other than yourself
can restore you to sanity?

01:15:50.201 --> 01:15:51.901
Yes.

01:15:51.903 --> 01:15:53.369
<i>And you made a decision
to turn your will and life</i>

01:15:53.371 --> 01:15:55.271
over to the care of God,
as you understand him,

01:15:55.273 --> 01:15:57.240
in your case,
Raquel Welch's snatch.

01:15:57.242 --> 01:15:58.909
And remember, this is
a choice of higher power

01:15:58.911 --> 01:16:00.144
I don't approve of.

01:16:00.146 --> 01:16:01.410
- Yes.
- <i>Great.</i>

01:16:01.412 --> 01:16:03.146
Now, wouldn't you like to turn

01:16:03.148 --> 01:16:04.780
this immediate problem
over to Chucky?

01:16:04.782 --> 01:16:06.249
Yes.

01:16:06.251 --> 01:16:08.287
<i>Don't you feel better already?</i>

01:16:11.389 --> 01:16:15.159
Okay, yeah, but, Donnie,
you tricked me.

01:16:15.161 --> 01:16:16.260
<i>I know what you just did.</i>

01:16:16.262 --> 01:16:19.262
No, Callahan, no. Fuck.

01:16:19.264 --> 01:16:20.864
Make a God basket.

01:16:20.866 --> 01:16:23.199
Write your problems
on paper, crumple them up,

01:16:23.201 --> 01:16:24.501
and throw them into the basket.

01:16:24.503 --> 01:16:26.840
<i>Drink water.</i>

01:16:30.308 --> 01:16:33.278
I'm afraid.
Who will protect me?

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:44.855
Tim. Tim?

01:16:44.857 --> 01:16:46.256
Hey, man.

01:16:46.258 --> 01:16:47.824
Can you pick up
that piece of paper

01:16:47.826 --> 01:16:49.829
and toss it in the God basket?

01:16:56.902 --> 01:16:58.435
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:16:58.437 --> 01:17:00.369
Hey, you know, this is
actually pretty fun.

01:17:00.371 --> 01:17:02.940
John, as the editors

01:17:02.942 --> 01:17:05.242
of the Portland State
"Vanguard,"

01:17:05.244 --> 01:17:08.278
some of us really
enjoy your humor,

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.846
but some of us are worried

01:17:09.848 --> 01:17:12.252
that things might have
gone too far.

01:17:13.585 --> 01:17:16.619
We have 55 letters here
from the student body

01:17:16.621 --> 01:17:18.888
complaining about
your cartoons.

01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:22.258
"Mr. Callahan, I am appalled
by your simplistic scribbling,

01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:24.427
your misinformed ideas
about humor,

01:17:24.429 --> 01:17:26.363
and the audacity you have..."

01:17:26.365 --> 01:17:28.297
- That's real?
- "...to think the public enjoys your work."

01:17:28.299 --> 01:17:30.234
Yes. It's from
Woodburn, Oregon.

01:17:30.236 --> 01:17:32.002
We have many of them.

01:17:32.004 --> 01:17:33.869
All right, look, guys,

01:17:33.871 --> 01:17:36.340
I-I know that people have
come by the editorial offices

01:17:36.342 --> 01:17:38.374
to register complaints
about me...

01:17:38.376 --> 01:17:39.642
Christians, queers, teachers,

01:17:39.644 --> 01:17:41.611
foreign nationals,
janitors, lab rats

01:17:41.613 --> 01:17:45.449
all find me offensive,
which, uh, you know...

01:17:45.451 --> 01:17:47.918
It's a good...
Is it a good thing?

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.886
We have a small pile
of threats.

01:17:49.888 --> 01:17:51.922
There's one here
from the "Willamette Week."

01:17:51.924 --> 01:17:54.358
John, this is, frankly, shocking.

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:57.927
What, the paper that
Gary Larson draws cartoons for?

01:17:57.929 --> 01:18:01.398
Yes. And they would
like to give you

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.333
your own series.

01:18:03.335 --> 01:18:05.401
We think that's
going too far.

01:18:05.403 --> 01:18:06.569
Are you serious?

01:18:06.571 --> 01:18:08.271
Uh...

01:18:08.273 --> 01:18:09.405
Can we get a mop?
Can we get a mop?

01:18:09.407 --> 01:18:10.673
- What happened?
- Oh. - Oh.

01:18:10.675 --> 01:18:12.376
- Grab a mop, please.
- Uh...

01:18:12.378 --> 01:18:14.011
Mop?

01:18:14.013 --> 01:18:15.712
Wait, well,
don't do it with the...

01:18:15.714 --> 01:18:18.414
- Don't-don't put the urine in the picture.
- Oh, yikes.

01:18:18.416 --> 01:18:19.315
They're publishing
your cartoon.

01:18:19.317 --> 01:18:20.950
We're absolutely serious.

01:18:20.952 --> 01:18:23.255
- I thought you guys were playing with me.
- No, no.

01:18:24.455 --> 01:18:26.959
In the Funny pile.

01:18:28.294 --> 01:18:29.362
No.

01:18:32.298 --> 01:18:34.233
Put this one for Annu.

01:18:38.370 --> 01:18:40.273
That's real funny.

01:18:47.345 --> 01:18:49.281
Why do you call it Chucky?

01:18:50.316 --> 01:18:52.983
Why not?

01:18:52.985 --> 01:18:55.952
You know, the day
I stopped drinking...

01:18:55.954 --> 01:18:58.355
I felt a hand on my shoulder.

01:18:58.357 --> 01:19:01.490
But when I turned
to look at it, there was...

01:19:01.492 --> 01:19:04.463
nothing there,
but I didn't imagine it.

01:19:07.633 --> 01:19:09.632
"Look at it,
but you cannot see it.

01:19:09.634 --> 01:19:13.403
Because it is formless,
you call it invisible.

01:19:13.405 --> 01:19:17.106
Listen to it,
but you cannot hear it.

01:19:17.108 --> 01:19:20.377
Because it is soundless,
you call it inaudible.

01:19:20.379 --> 01:19:22.712
Grasp it, but it is
out of your reach.

01:19:22.714 --> 01:19:25.617
Because it is subtle,
you call it intangible."

01:19:26.617 --> 01:19:28.517
Uh, who's that?

01:19:28.519 --> 01:19:31.053
Is that Elton John?

01:19:31.055 --> 01:19:32.588
Lao-Tzu.

01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:34.526
Chucky.

01:19:37.362 --> 01:19:39.395
Oh, hubba, hubba, hubba.

01:19:39.397 --> 01:19:41.433
New heartthrob, Donnie?

01:19:43.768 --> 01:19:45.401
Oh, no, no.

01:19:45.403 --> 01:19:47.372
Pretty boy, small penis.

01:19:48.139 --> 01:19:49.672
Maybe you were weakened

01:19:49.674 --> 01:19:51.475
so you could
become strong, Callahan.

01:19:51.477 --> 01:19:53.313
You ever think of it like that?

01:19:56.048 --> 01:19:58.651
Path to enlightenment
is to know yourself.

01:20:00.085 --> 01:20:01.688
How do I know myself?

01:20:03.455 --> 01:20:05.087
Forget yourself.

01:20:10.396 --> 01:20:12.628
Oh, what'd the doctor say?

01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:15.164
I was gonna tell you about
when I was in India.

01:20:15.166 --> 01:20:17.501
Just let me finish
so I don't forget.

01:20:17.503 --> 01:20:20.035
I was driving north, to Bombay.

01:20:20.037 --> 01:20:21.605
I was meeting
a group of teachers

01:20:21.607 --> 01:20:22.806
- at the Bombay Hilton...
- Oh, yeah, no,

01:20:22.808 --> 01:20:25.441
you told me this story already.

01:20:25.443 --> 01:20:26.176
Have I?

01:20:26.178 --> 01:20:27.511
Yeah.

01:20:27.513 --> 01:20:29.512
With the girl beggar.

01:20:29.514 --> 01:20:32.084
I don't remember telling it.

01:20:34.052 --> 01:20:35.655
Donnie.

01:20:37.423 --> 01:20:39.092
What did the doctor say?

01:20:46.531 --> 01:20:48.101
I'm fucked.

01:20:55.206 --> 01:20:57.075
I need to drink more water.

01:21:19.097 --> 01:21:22.168
Mmm. That feels good.
Thank you.

01:21:27.473 --> 01:21:29.672
"Dear Mr. Callahan,
we regret to inform you

01:21:29.674 --> 01:21:32.108
that although your cartoon
shows promise,

01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:34.578
it's not the caliber of work
that we're used to

01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:36.480
at "The New Yorker."

01:21:36.482 --> 01:21:38.481
Thank you for your submission."

01:21:38.483 --> 01:21:40.585
Who reads "The New Yorker"?

01:21:43.856 --> 01:21:46.756
"Mr. Callahan, you should
draw with your other hand

01:21:46.758 --> 01:21:48.725
or become a plumber."

01:21:49.894 --> 01:21:51.761
"Sincerely, Robert."

01:21:51.763 --> 01:21:54.167
Well, that's original.

01:21:56.535 --> 01:21:59.502
Hey...

01:21:59.504 --> 01:22:01.837
do you think the joke is better
if I go with paramecium,

01:22:01.839 --> 01:22:06.510
dogfish, chimpanzee,
Neanderthal, human?

01:22:06.512 --> 01:22:08.677
Or should it be...

01:22:08.679 --> 01:22:12.516
paramecium, trilobite,
raptor, lemur,

01:22:12.518 --> 01:22:15.584
Neanderthal, human?

01:22:15.586 --> 01:22:17.189
I don't know.

01:22:18.523 --> 01:22:20.559
Let's put that
in the Not Ready pile.

01:22:36.607 --> 01:22:38.173
Hello.

01:22:38.175 --> 01:22:39.909
John, can I come in?

01:22:39.911 --> 01:22:41.944
Suzanne.

01:22:41.946 --> 01:22:43.279
Hey.

01:22:43.281 --> 01:22:44.983
What a lovely surprise.

01:22:49.287 --> 01:22:51.555
Where'd you get the money
for these posters?

01:22:51.557 --> 01:22:52.689
Friends, family.

01:22:52.691 --> 01:22:54.224
You got to write it down.

01:22:54.226 --> 01:22:57.260
You have to report it...
any gift or donation.

01:22:57.262 --> 01:22:58.828
Well...

01:22:58.830 --> 01:23:01.664
I bummed a cigarette
down at Old Town the other day.

01:23:01.666 --> 01:23:03.766
Should I report that, too?

01:23:03.768 --> 01:23:05.569
Mr. Callahan, I'm sorry.

01:23:05.571 --> 01:23:06.936
Do not make the rules.

01:23:06.938 --> 01:23:08.738
Simply trying
to get you to understand

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:10.673
the gravity of the situation;
your cartoon earnings

01:23:10.675 --> 01:23:12.708
could force your benefits
to be terminated.

01:23:12.710 --> 01:23:14.778
Well, h-how do I avoid that?

01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:16.279
I-I don't know.

01:23:16.281 --> 01:23:19.849
But, uh... it doesn't
look good for you.

01:23:19.851 --> 01:23:21.318
Uh, who do I speak to

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.720
about the specific
regulations on this?

01:23:23.722 --> 01:23:25.855
I mean, how can I be penalized

01:23:25.857 --> 01:23:29.258
for making a little money
this month?

01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:31.328
Mr. Callahan,
we have reason to believe

01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:33.629
you're a bit of
a shady character. Okay?

01:23:33.631 --> 01:23:36.733
I just don't want
your benefits to be terminated.

01:23:36.735 --> 01:23:39.602
Every letter
starts out the same way.

01:23:39.604 --> 01:23:41.605
It's always your fault.

01:23:41.607 --> 01:23:44.608
You know, I-I...
I-I knew, um,

01:23:44.610 --> 01:23:46.976
a-a guy that was
a former caseworker.

01:23:46.978 --> 01:23:48.912
He's since become a buddy.

01:23:48.914 --> 01:23:53.650
And he revealed to me
that any assertive client

01:23:53.652 --> 01:23:55.651
was written up in his file

01:23:55.653 --> 01:23:58.721
as a fucking
unstable troublemaker.

01:23:58.723 --> 01:24:00.957
You fucking believe that?

01:24:00.959 --> 01:24:03.258
An unstable troublemaker.

01:24:04.729 --> 01:24:08.330
John, this isn't
the complaint department.

01:24:08.332 --> 01:24:11.066
We don't want to hear
about your caseworkers.

01:24:11.068 --> 01:24:13.837
Tell your story,
talk about yourself.

01:24:13.839 --> 01:24:15.838
Well, it is my life.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.341
I rely on them for everything.

01:24:18.343 --> 01:24:20.075
I don't, I don't know
what you mean.

01:24:20.077 --> 01:24:22.044
What I mean is
that what about them

01:24:22.046 --> 01:24:24.948
makes you complain?

01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:27.751
It's not about
the counselor herself.

01:24:27.753 --> 01:24:29.621
Keep going.

01:24:31.822 --> 01:24:33.823
I mean, I can't walk.

01:24:33.825 --> 01:24:35.358
Why can't you walk?

01:24:37.028 --> 01:24:38.727
Because I was in an accident.

01:24:38.729 --> 01:24:40.363
Because?

01:24:40.365 --> 01:24:43.900
'Cause the fucking asshole,
Dexter,

01:24:43.902 --> 01:24:46.403
fell asleep
at the fucking wheel.

01:24:46.405 --> 01:24:48.104
Why'd he do that?

01:24:48.106 --> 01:24:49.739
'Cause he was fucking drunk.

01:24:49.741 --> 01:24:52.111
Okay, and why
were you in the car?

01:24:54.112 --> 01:24:56.078
'Cause we were
going to the next party.

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.946
He was the one
that was driving.

01:24:57.948 --> 01:24:59.349
I don't know why I-I...

01:24:59.351 --> 01:25:01.083
- Okay, but why...
- I couldn't drive.

01:25:01.085 --> 01:25:03.720
Wait, Callahan, why did you
get in the car with him

01:25:03.722 --> 01:25:05.320
- if you knew he was drunk?
- I don't know,

01:25:05.322 --> 01:25:08.057
'cause I was a fucking kid!
You don't make mistakes?

01:25:08.059 --> 01:25:10.325
Why did you
get in the car with him

01:25:10.327 --> 01:25:12.127
if you knew he was drunk?

01:25:12.129 --> 01:25:13.930
Why would you do something
like that?

01:25:13.932 --> 01:25:16.032
Would you do that right now?

01:25:16.034 --> 01:25:18.467
Would you get in the car with
someone who you knew was drunk?

01:25:19.737 --> 01:25:21.070
Why did you do that?

01:25:21.072 --> 01:25:22.806
I don't know why.

01:25:22.808 --> 01:25:26.743
I... I was so fucking drunk.

01:25:26.745 --> 01:25:28.977
I was so fucking drunk.

01:25:28.979 --> 01:25:31.881
I was drunk
since I was a fucking kid.

01:25:31.883 --> 01:25:33.349
I was so embarrassing.

01:25:33.351 --> 01:25:36.752
I know, 'cause I didn't...

01:25:36.754 --> 01:25:38.887
I didn't feel loved,

01:25:38.889 --> 01:25:40.056
I didn't feel wanted,

01:25:40.058 --> 01:25:42.825
so I tried
to cover up my feelings.

01:25:42.827 --> 01:25:45.494
And it worked.

01:25:45.496 --> 01:25:49.168
I was born in 1951.

01:25:50.736 --> 01:25:53.072
At the old
Saint Vincent's Hospital.

01:25:55.107 --> 01:25:58.077
I know three things
about my real mother.

01:25:59.811 --> 01:26:02.846
She was Irish-American.

01:26:02.848 --> 01:26:04.948
She had red hair.

01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:07.086
And she was a school teacher.

01:26:09.521 --> 01:26:12.087
Oh, yeah.

01:26:12.089 --> 01:26:15.425
And she didn't want me.

01:26:26.838 --> 01:26:29.873
My alienation from my father...

01:26:29.875 --> 01:26:32.876
I hated his guts
since I was 11...

01:26:32.878 --> 01:26:35.414
extended itself
to my whole family.

01:26:37.182 --> 01:26:39.414
One Christmas...

01:26:39.416 --> 01:26:41.818
at the dinner table...

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:44.423
there was a... disturbance.

01:26:45.557 --> 01:26:47.190
And Tommy,

01:26:47.192 --> 01:26:51.261
who was some five years
younger than me,

01:26:51.263 --> 01:26:53.262
screamed.

01:26:53.264 --> 01:26:58.236
Whenever my dad
punished one of my siblings...

01:27:01.071 --> 01:27:03.105
instead of me,

01:27:03.107 --> 01:27:06.943
it gave me
a guilt-free excuse to...

01:27:06.945 --> 01:27:08.477
condemn him.

01:27:08.479 --> 01:27:12.117
I guess that was
a big thing, you know?

01:27:13.151 --> 01:27:17.052
I never felt a part of them.

01:27:17.054 --> 01:27:20.125
I never felt like
I was one of them.

01:27:22.893 --> 01:27:24.194
I thought I'd fucking

01:27:24.196 --> 01:27:26.229
drink my way
out of those feelings.

01:27:26.231 --> 01:27:30.135
I became such a fuck up...

01:27:32.269 --> 01:27:34.473
that I won't ever forgive them.

01:27:37.576 --> 01:27:39.141
Oh, I mean that...

01:27:39.143 --> 01:27:42.945
I mean, they won't
ever forgive me

01:27:42.947 --> 01:27:47.016
for all the...
stupid shit I did.

01:27:47.018 --> 01:27:48.918
What'd you just say?

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:50.185
That they won't...

01:27:50.187 --> 01:27:53.021
forgive me for
all the stupid shit I did.

01:27:55.125 --> 01:27:57.025
That they won't forgive you

01:27:57.027 --> 01:27:59.127
or you won't forgive them?

01:27:59.129 --> 01:28:01.530
That they won't forgive me.

01:28:01.532 --> 01:28:03.533
You said that
you won't forgive them.

01:28:03.535 --> 01:28:07.339
Okay, well, wh-what would
I have to forgive them f...

01:28:08.505 --> 01:28:10.205
forgive them for?

01:28:10.207 --> 01:28:12.641
For making you feel
like a black sheep.

01:28:12.643 --> 01:28:14.276
For not being
your real parents,

01:28:14.278 --> 01:28:16.115
for having other children.

01:28:17.549 --> 01:28:20.119
Forgiving your birth mother
for giving you up.

01:28:24.522 --> 01:28:25.989
Think about me!

01:28:25.991 --> 01:28:28.127
I won't forgive them.

01:28:30.961 --> 01:28:32.328
You're right on time, John.

01:28:32.330 --> 01:28:35.030
You're approaching
the ninth step,

01:28:35.032 --> 01:28:39.034
which is where you get to go
face-to-face with these people

01:28:39.036 --> 01:28:41.539
and forgive them in person.

01:28:42.907 --> 01:28:45.341
That's it?

01:28:47.545 --> 01:28:49.678
I mean, uh...

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.248
I kind of thought that my...

01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:56.019
group story would end
with an epiphany.

01:28:56.021 --> 01:28:58.354
Like, you know, I'd...

01:28:58.356 --> 01:29:02.057
break down and cry,
and-and, uh...

01:29:02.059 --> 01:29:04.092
be cured forever.

01:29:05.964 --> 01:29:07.262
Nope.

01:29:07.264 --> 01:29:10.967
No, I don't feel
that different now.

01:29:10.969 --> 01:29:13.269
I don't...

01:29:13.271 --> 01:29:15.605
I don't feel like
I had the big moment.

01:29:15.607 --> 01:29:17.105
This is the big moment.

01:29:17.107 --> 01:29:19.374
There's no lightning bolt
that shoots you

01:29:19.376 --> 01:29:21.110
and cures all your shit.

01:29:21.112 --> 01:29:24.047
There are discoveries
and epiphanies

01:29:24.049 --> 01:29:27.050
and moments of clarity.

01:29:27.052 --> 01:29:29.220
But this doesn't just go away.

01:29:30.722 --> 01:29:33.189
You have to wrestle
with this shit every day.

01:29:33.191 --> 01:29:35.291
Some of that pain
will remain there forever.

01:29:35.293 --> 01:29:37.293
Some of that shame will
remain there forever.

01:29:37.295 --> 01:29:40.966
But you have to fight with it,
or you'll fucking die.

01:29:44.736 --> 01:29:46.405
Thank you.

01:29:51.977 --> 01:29:53.976
Mr. Levine?

01:29:53.978 --> 01:29:55.211
John?

01:29:55.213 --> 01:29:56.980
Yeah.

01:29:56.982 --> 01:29:58.715
It's been so long.

01:29:58.717 --> 01:30:00.216
Uh, hey.

01:30:00.218 --> 01:30:01.617
- How you been doing?
- All right.

01:30:01.619 --> 01:30:03.319
- You still drawing?
- Yeah.

01:30:03.321 --> 01:30:05.754
I remember you back
in high... in high school,

01:30:05.756 --> 01:30:07.190
you had problems with sketches.

01:30:07.192 --> 01:30:09.225
But then you got
into oil colors,

01:30:09.227 --> 01:30:10.760
- and it sort of reversed on itself.
- Yeah.

01:30:10.762 --> 01:30:14.096
You were quite
the student back then.

01:30:14.098 --> 01:30:16.431
Hey, um...

01:30:16.433 --> 01:30:19.002
Hey, I just want to apologize.

01:30:19.004 --> 01:30:20.302
Apologize for what?

01:30:20.304 --> 01:30:22.270
Well, I was...

01:30:22.272 --> 01:30:25.208
I caused some troubles
in class, and...

01:30:25.210 --> 01:30:26.708
and you didn't deserve that.

01:30:26.710 --> 01:30:29.011
And, uh, I felt bad
about it, and...

01:30:29.013 --> 01:30:30.645
I just want to make amends.

01:30:30.647 --> 01:30:33.248
Well, that's great
you should say that, John.

01:30:33.250 --> 01:30:36.084
Teenagers, you know, you go
through these stages, so...

01:30:36.086 --> 01:30:39.055
I could see potential in you.
That was the main thing.

01:30:39.057 --> 01:30:41.757
I stole a shirt from this store
ten years ago,

01:30:41.759 --> 01:30:44.260
and I'd like to
make it up to you.

01:30:44.262 --> 01:30:46.796
It would really
screw up our books.

01:30:46.798 --> 01:30:48.330
Um...

01:30:48.332 --> 01:30:50.800
just give five dollars
to a charity,

01:30:50.802 --> 01:30:52.438
and that'll make it good, son.

01:30:54.339 --> 01:30:56.241
Hey, John.

01:31:11.121 --> 01:31:12.821
What do you want from me, John?

01:31:12.823 --> 01:31:15.257
Yeah, I was just thinking,
you know,

01:31:15.259 --> 01:31:19.194
we've had a pretty contentious
relationship, and, um...

01:31:19.196 --> 01:31:21.196
Probably made you
feel bad a lot.

01:31:21.198 --> 01:31:23.166
And, um...

01:31:23.168 --> 01:31:26.468
I realize that it must be
a really hard job, actually.

01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:31.274
And, uh, I probably made it
more difficult.

01:31:31.276 --> 01:31:33.443
And, um...

01:31:33.445 --> 01:31:36.311
and I wanted to apologize.

01:31:36.313 --> 01:31:39.849
Well, uh, th... thanks
for apologizing. I...

01:31:39.851 --> 01:31:44.022
And, uh... sure.
I forgive you.

01:31:45.423 --> 01:31:49.061
Hey, I made
this drawing for you.

01:31:55.299 --> 01:31:57.400
Oh, boy.

01:31:57.402 --> 01:32:00.168
Well... I don't know,
maybe you can help me.

01:32:00.170 --> 01:32:03.105
I'm trying to do something
with Klansmen,

01:32:03.107 --> 01:32:05.208
like... you know,
just make them, like,

01:32:05.210 --> 01:32:07.275
more human, you know?

01:32:07.277 --> 01:32:08.778
- 'Cause everyone always talks about...
- Klansmen?

01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:10.279
Well, no, because people

01:32:10.281 --> 01:32:13.216
always think about...
racists as, like,

01:32:13.218 --> 01:32:15.584
just this, like, pure evil,
but they're your neighbors.

01:32:15.586 --> 01:32:16.886
I don't know, I guess...

01:32:16.888 --> 01:32:18.553
sheets.

01:32:18.555 --> 01:32:20.355
Uh...

01:32:20.357 --> 01:32:23.126
what I like about sheets
is they're sort of, like,

01:32:23.128 --> 01:32:25.360
warm and fluffy when
you get 'em out of the dryer.

01:32:26.763 --> 01:32:28.230
Don't you love it

01:32:28.232 --> 01:32:30.333
when they're still warm
from the dryer?

I'm really good.

01:33:22.219 --> 01:33:23.618
Yeah.

01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:25.253
I'm sober now.

01:33:25.255 --> 01:33:28.291

- Yeah.

01:33:28.293 --> 01:33:29.425
Yeah.

01:33:29.427 --> 01:33:31.894
And, uh... it's good.

01:33:31.896 --> 01:33:33.895
It's really good.

01:33:33.897 --> 01:33:35.898
I been doing it, too,
on and off,

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.867
- for, like, the last seven years, but...
- Is that right?

01:33:37.869 --> 01:33:39.968
I'm fucking...
I'm a fuck up, though, man.

01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:41.671
- I don't...
- Ah, it's okay.

01:33:41.673 --> 01:33:44.507
I don't stick to it, but...

01:33:44.509 --> 01:33:47.310
Buddy, I came this fucking
close to reaching out to you,

01:33:47.312 --> 01:33:51.346
but, uh, you know,
I just chicken shitted out.

01:33:51.348 --> 01:33:53.548
I'm so fucking glad
you're here.

01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:57.386
Yeah. You've been
on my mind, too.

01:33:57.388 --> 01:33:59.321
I just didn't know
what to fucking say.

01:33:59.323 --> 01:34:00.655
I was fucking...

01:34:00.657 --> 01:34:03.258
I mean,
there's nothing I can say.

01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:05.595
There's nothing I can say.

01:34:05.597 --> 01:34:08.330
You know, what I've been
learning is...

01:34:08.332 --> 01:34:10.365
I fucked my shit up.

01:34:10.367 --> 01:34:13.336
And it started
long before I met you.

01:34:13.338 --> 01:34:16.239
It's all right.

01:34:16.241 --> 01:34:17.974
It is. Don't feel bad.

01:34:17.976 --> 01:34:22.410
No, I actually want
to tell you that I was sorry.

01:34:22.412 --> 01:34:24.247
What do you mean?
You're not s...

01:34:24.249 --> 01:34:25.314
What are you sorry for?

01:34:25.316 --> 01:34:26.582
Hey, man,

01:34:26.584 --> 01:34:29.284
I'm responsible, too,
and I'm sure that

01:34:29.286 --> 01:34:31.453
it's probably
really difficult for you.

01:34:31.455 --> 01:34:33.455
I mean, all those years,
I imagine.

01:34:33.457 --> 01:34:36.258
I don't want you
to feel guilty or feel bad.

01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:39.427
You need to know
I had a good life, man.

01:34:39.429 --> 01:34:40.663
Really.

01:34:40.665 --> 01:34:42.898
Things are good.

01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:44.699
It's really good.

01:34:44.701 --> 01:34:46.435
- No shit?
- Yeah.

01:34:46.437 --> 01:34:51.039
I've had a fucking
shitty fucking life, man.

01:34:51.041 --> 01:34:53.708
Sorry.

01:34:53.710 --> 01:34:55.646
It's fine.

01:34:59.049 --> 01:35:01.219
Um...

01:35:05.423 --> 01:35:07.623
I'm coming in. I'm coming in.

01:35:08.992 --> 01:35:11.327
Ah, ah, it's all right, man.

01:35:21.004 --> 01:35:23.241
Hi, Mom.

01:35:25.009 --> 01:35:27.310
You look pretty.

01:35:31.549 --> 01:35:34.553
I guess I have to forgive you
more than anyone.

01:35:37.021 --> 01:35:39.321
I've cursed you.

01:35:39.323 --> 01:35:41.460
I've screamed at you.

01:35:44.394 --> 01:35:47.096
I never considered what it...

01:35:47.098 --> 01:35:49.401
might have been like for you.

01:35:51.102 --> 01:35:54.970
Might be it was
really difficult to give me up.

01:35:54.972 --> 01:35:56.439
Or maybe it wasn't.

01:35:58.009 --> 01:35:59.711
And that's okay, too.

01:36:02.379 --> 01:36:05.648
I guess...

01:36:05.650 --> 01:36:10.354
I guess I'll never find you,
no matter how much I search.

01:36:11.621 --> 01:36:14.459
Looking up every
Maggie Lynch that I could.

01:36:15.727 --> 01:36:19.398
You know, I even found
someone that knew you.

01:36:22.433 --> 01:36:24.069
I got close.

01:36:28.039 --> 01:36:29.775
But, Mom...

01:36:31.442 --> 01:36:33.376
wherever...

01:36:33.378 --> 01:36:35.644
wherever you are,

01:36:35.646 --> 01:36:37.549
I need you to know...

01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:41.753
I forgive you.

01:36:43.821 --> 01:36:45.756
It's okay.

01:36:53.397 --> 01:36:56.164
What's that painting, Donnie?

01:36:56.166 --> 01:36:59.502
I don't know.

01:36:59.504 --> 01:37:03.342
I got it the same way I got
all this shit, inherited it.

01:37:04.575 --> 01:37:06.742
It's, like...

01:37:06.744 --> 01:37:09.412
my grandparents were, like...

01:37:09.414 --> 01:37:12.681
fucking really rich.

01:37:12.683 --> 01:37:14.650
So, like,
my parents grew up rich,

01:37:14.652 --> 01:37:17.485
and then, like,
I grew up really rich.

01:37:17.487 --> 01:37:20.489
It's, like, so stupid.

01:37:22.125 --> 01:37:25.727
It's nice, but it's stupid.

01:37:25.729 --> 01:37:30.132
Have you visited everyone
you felt you wronged?

01:37:30.134 --> 01:37:32.101
Forgiven everyone
you wanted to forgive?

01:37:32.103 --> 01:37:33.601
Yeah.

01:37:33.603 --> 01:37:35.671
So...

01:37:35.673 --> 01:37:38.440
what, I'm all cleared up, huh?

01:37:38.442 --> 01:37:40.476
Step ten, next?

01:37:40.478 --> 01:37:43.878
What about yourself?

01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:45.480
What do you mean?

01:37:45.482 --> 01:37:47.615
It's not all about your mother.

01:37:47.617 --> 01:37:50.121
You have to
forgive yourself, too.

01:37:51.856 --> 01:37:54.190
Forgive yourself
for listening to Dexter,

01:37:54.192 --> 01:37:57.496
forgive yourself for
going with him that night.

01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:08.636
Hello, Brenda.
Hello, all my friends.

01:38:08.638 --> 01:38:11.239
How are you?
It is a great day today.

01:38:11.241 --> 01:38:14.476
Hey, what's happening?
What's up, John?

01:38:14.478 --> 01:38:16.244
Ah, nothing much.

01:38:16.246 --> 01:38:18.646
You know, the usual.

01:38:18.648 --> 01:38:21.617
Thought you might want
to take a look at this.

01:38:21.619 --> 01:38:23.485
What's this?

01:38:23.487 --> 01:38:25.156
Oh, nothing.

01:38:26.523 --> 01:38:27.823
Mm-hmm.

01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:32.194
That's funny.

01:38:32.196 --> 01:38:33.529
What is this?

01:38:33.531 --> 01:38:35.530
"Penthouse."
Oh, wow, that's nice.

01:38:35.532 --> 01:38:37.632
- "Oh, well, that's nice"? That's it?
- It's great.

01:38:37.634 --> 01:38:39.868
"This area's patrolled
by lesbians."

01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:41.636
What are you saying
about lesbians?

01:38:41.638 --> 01:38:43.506
Are they intimidating
or something?

01:38:43.508 --> 01:38:45.673
No, it's not...
I'm just saying, you know,

01:38:45.675 --> 01:38:46.876
well, maybe they're, like,

01:38:46.878 --> 01:38:49.244
naked construction site
security...

01:38:49.246 --> 01:38:51.579
Very educational article.

01:38:51.581 --> 01:38:53.649
Well, it's just a cartoon.

01:38:53.651 --> 01:38:55.184
- I mean, it's just supposed to be funny.
- Hey, John!

01:38:55.186 --> 01:38:57.252
- John!
- Yeah?

01:38:57.254 --> 01:38:58.587
What do you got?

01:39:00.957 --> 01:39:03.292
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:39:03.294 --> 01:39:05.793
Take a look.

01:39:05.795 --> 01:39:07.262
All right, let me check.

01:39:07.264 --> 01:39:09.731
Okay, that's funny.

01:39:09.733 --> 01:39:11.233
- It's funny.
- It's funny.

01:39:11.235 --> 01:39:12.735
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:39:12.737 --> 01:39:14.770
It is funny. Well, why do
you think it's funny?

01:39:14.772 --> 01:39:16.939
- Oh, wow.
- It's, uh...

01:39:16.941 --> 01:39:19.275
It's funny
'cause it makes you laugh.

01:39:19.277 --> 01:39:20.310
It's not that funny.

01:39:20.312 --> 01:39:22.810
The joke is funny
because of the sign

01:39:22.812 --> 01:39:26.248
suggesting that lesbians will
kick your ass if you cross.

01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:28.182
It's-it's unexpected.

01:39:28.184 --> 01:39:30.252
It's-it's like a warning sign
for attack dogs,

01:39:30.254 --> 01:39:32.288
- but instead it's lesbians.
- Thank you.

01:39:32.290 --> 01:39:34.256
I mean, for the-the readers
of "Penthouse,"

01:39:34.258 --> 01:39:37.959
these men, this-this plays on
this shared fear of women.

01:39:37.961 --> 01:39:41.329
Just this unexpected
mutual fear.

01:39:41.331 --> 01:39:42.965
I mean, it's...

01:39:42.967 --> 01:39:45.234
Wow. I mean, what's scarier
than a group of women

01:39:45.236 --> 01:39:47.970
that don't need men?

01:39:47.972 --> 01:39:50.773
It's also just...
really fucking funny.

01:39:50.775 --> 01:39:52.341
- That's what I think.
- That is funny.

01:39:52.343 --> 01:39:53.909
- I didn't even think about it.
- The "lesbian,"

01:39:53.911 --> 01:39:55.043
- exclamation point.
- I don't know...

01:39:55.045 --> 01:39:57.346
You guys want another beer?

01:39:57.348 --> 01:39:59.614
- Let me buy you guys a beer. What are you drinking?
- Uh...

01:39:59.616 --> 01:40:00.916
- Gherkin.
- Cerveza?

01:40:00.918 --> 01:40:02.284
- Yeah.
- You want a cerveza?

01:40:02.286 --> 01:40:03.319
- Same. Yeah.
- That's fine.

01:40:03.321 --> 01:40:04.819
Hey, can I get three cervezas?

01:40:04.821 --> 01:40:06.654
You know what?
Beer for everybody!

01:40:08.058 --> 01:40:11.760
Hey, John.
What you got for us?

01:40:11.762 --> 01:40:14.296
Yes.

01:40:14.298 --> 01:40:15.998
This one's great.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.603
- This came for you, John.
- Awesome. Thank you.

01:40:32.383 --> 01:40:34.016
Hey! Callahan!

01:40:34.018 --> 01:40:35.954
Loved that lawyer joke!

01:40:43.628 --> 01:40:46.794
- Hey. I loved your Jesus joke, man.
- Ah, really?

01:40:46.796 --> 01:40:49.567
Thank God it's Friday.

01:40:50.334 --> 01:40:52.333
Your cartoons are sickening.

01:40:52.335 --> 01:40:54.939
You should be dropped
from the paper!

01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.840
She was really mad.

01:40:57.842 --> 01:40:59.874
Yeah. I like those reactions
the best, though.

01:40:59.876 --> 01:41:02.845
You know? She's really
telling it like it is.

01:41:02.847 --> 01:41:05.346
Over here?

01:41:05.348 --> 01:41:07.082
- You want to see?
- Mm.

01:41:07.084 --> 01:41:09.318
I've been in
ten different bands.

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:10.985
Yes!

01:41:10.987 --> 01:41:12.421
That's what I'm talking about.

01:41:12.423 --> 01:41:14.657
"Harmonious male backpacker..."

01:41:14.659 --> 01:41:16.891
Oh. My God, Annu, look at this.

01:41:16.893 --> 01:41:18.793
"Harmonious male backpacker

01:41:18.795 --> 01:41:21.396
into making 16th century
stringed instruments

01:41:21.398 --> 01:41:24.099
seeks radical feminist
household which will not

01:41:24.101 --> 01:41:26.135
tease me about my testicles."

01:41:27.737 --> 01:41:29.137
I mean, is this fucking real?

01:41:29.139 --> 01:41:30.838
It doesn't seem
that strange, John.

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.041
It doesn't?

01:41:32.043 --> 01:41:33.742
You're just living in the past.

01:41:33.744 --> 01:41:36.113
I'm living in the pa... Oh.

01:41:45.822 --> 01:41:48.093
Bye for now.

01:42:07.445 --> 01:42:09.444
I got you.

01:42:12.148 --> 01:42:15.150
Are you working
on your sobriety?

01:42:15.152 --> 01:42:18.419
Still working on it, man.

01:42:18.421 --> 01:42:21.023
Finishing all the levels?

01:42:21.025 --> 01:42:22.791
Yep.

01:42:22.793 --> 01:42:24.827
I spoke at a meeting last week.

01:42:24.829 --> 01:42:27.096
- John.
- Yeah.

01:42:27.098 --> 01:42:30.132
That is great.

01:42:30.134 --> 01:42:32.400
I love step 12.

01:42:32.402 --> 01:42:34.936
Yeah, I mean...

01:42:34.938 --> 01:42:37.107
I was nervous, still, but...

01:42:38.174 --> 01:42:40.110
I don't know, giving back.

01:42:42.079 --> 01:42:44.683
You forgive yourself yet?

01:42:46.916 --> 01:42:48.186
I think so.

01:42:49.085 --> 01:42:52.056
What'd you forgive
yourself for?

01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:55.059
I forgave myself for...

01:42:56.927 --> 01:42:58.796
looking for better babes.

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:06.135
Did I ever tell you
how I stay sober?

01:43:06.137 --> 01:43:07.871
Tell me again.

01:43:10.875 --> 01:43:13.478
I was with someone
for a long time.

01:43:15.411 --> 01:43:18.148
He was great.
He was a really sweet person.

01:43:20.183 --> 01:43:23.153
But I was...
I was very selfish.

01:43:27.825 --> 01:43:29.260
I was very fucked-up.

01:43:32.228 --> 01:43:33.995
And, uh...

01:43:33.997 --> 01:43:37.065
he... uh, he came home one day,

01:43:37.067 --> 01:43:40.168
and I was having a seizure
on the floor.

01:43:40.170 --> 01:43:41.905
And...

01:43:51.247 --> 01:43:54.149
When I get close
to wanting a drink,

01:43:54.151 --> 01:43:58.122
I... I don't think of myself
or my life.

01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:06.160
I think of him.

01:44:06.162 --> 01:44:08.165
His face.

01:44:16.941 --> 01:44:19.842
I don't know how many, uh...

01:44:19.844 --> 01:44:23.278
more of these talks
we're gonna have, 'cause...

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:26.951
I'm seeing the-the gymnasts
on the lawn, John.

01:44:28.251 --> 01:44:30.254
Don't say that.

01:44:35.159 --> 01:44:38.226
Big part of this program

01:44:38.228 --> 01:44:40.964
is losing people
you don't want to lose.

01:44:47.170 --> 01:44:50.307
Being a model to the world...

01:44:53.210 --> 01:44:57.279
eternal virtue will be yours,

01:44:57.281 --> 01:45:00.185
and you return
to the boundless.

01:45:01.951 --> 01:45:04.019
Lao-Tzu.

01:45:04.021 --> 01:45:05.186
Chuck E. Cheese.

01:45:17.034 --> 01:45:19.301
I think I'm still
a little selfish.

01:45:19.303 --> 01:45:22.904
I was helping
you guys a lot, 'cause...

01:45:22.906 --> 01:45:24.273
it was helping me.

01:45:24.275 --> 01:45:26.311
My 12th step, being a sponsor.

01:45:30.246 --> 01:45:33.015
You were such
a pain in the ass, John.

01:45:34.285 --> 01:45:36.217
I'm sorry.

01:45:36.219 --> 01:45:38.220
You're the best, Donnie.

01:45:38.222 --> 01:45:40.021
You really helped me.

01:45:40.023 --> 01:45:41.558
You helped all of us.

01:45:42.992 --> 01:45:45.229
It is hard
teaching people faith.

01:45:55.939 --> 01:45:57.342
Give me a hug.

01:46:02.179 --> 01:46:04.082
Come here.

01:46:09.186 --> 01:46:11.052
Drink water.

01:46:11.054 --> 01:46:12.320
You, too.

01:46:12.322 --> 01:46:15.190
It doesn't work.

01:46:15.192 --> 01:46:17.159
It really doesn't.

01:46:18.963 --> 01:46:21.296
<i>Adios, amigo.</i>

01:46:21.298 --> 01:46:23.230
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:46:23.232 --> 01:46:25.266
He used to wear these
really, really cool scarves.

01:46:25.268 --> 01:46:27.168
Yeah, he looks like a wizard.

01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:29.171
Yeah, Donnie got
really sick over time.

01:46:29.173 --> 01:46:32.173
- And they discovered he had AIDS.
- Mm.

01:46:32.175 --> 01:46:35.209
That was the last time
I saw him before he died.

01:46:35.211 --> 01:46:37.244
- Oh.
- The truth...

01:46:37.246 --> 01:46:39.114
- Yeah, the truth hurts.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:46:39.116 --> 01:46:40.649
Unfortunately.

01:46:40.651 --> 01:46:42.117
So, do you want to come
to the skate ramp with us?

01:46:42.119 --> 01:46:43.651
- Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:46:43.653 --> 01:46:45.087
Where is it?

01:46:45.089 --> 01:46:46.355
Uh, it's down the block,
actually.

01:46:46.357 --> 01:46:48.323
- Show me the way.
- Yeah! It's there.

01:46:50.193 --> 01:46:52.627
- That way.
- That way?

01:47:13.317 --> 01:47:15.249
<i>I'd like to thank</i>

01:47:15.251 --> 01:47:17.722
all those who made it possible
for me to be here tonight.

01:47:33.269 --> 01:47:35.203
I feel...

01:47:37.273 --> 01:47:41.243
...stimulated, magical.

01:47:41.245 --> 01:47:43.211
At night, I seem
to think more clearly.

01:47:43.213 --> 01:47:48.085
<i>I work hard, but it doesn't
feel like work to me.</i>

01:47:51.287 --> 01:47:53.355
<i>The intellectual clutter
of the daytime hours</i>

01:47:53.357 --> 01:47:58.060
dissolves from my mind,
which moves in an almost...

01:47:58.062 --> 01:48:00.999
instinctual, animal way.

01:48:02.198 --> 01:48:03.768
I'm happy.

01:48:05.302 --> 01:48:07.702
I don't care that the job

01:48:07.704 --> 01:48:10.271
or the welfare office
is giving me gray hairs,

01:48:10.273 --> 01:48:11.742
because...

01:48:13.410 --> 01:48:19.247
ideas and images
are flowing through me

01:48:19.249 --> 01:48:21.285
and onto the paper.

01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:26.288
I'd like to thank
all those who made it possible

01:48:26.290 --> 01:48:28.292
for me to be here tonight.

01:48:31.195 --> 01:48:33.331
Because if it weren't
for you...

01:48:34.464 --> 01:48:37.466
I don't think
I would have made it.

01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:16.171
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:49:16.173 --> 01:49:17.305
Oh.

01:49:17.307 --> 01:49:18.773
- That was good.
- Yeah, John.

01:49:18.775 --> 01:49:20.175
Get it!

01:49:20.177 --> 01:49:21.275
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

01:49:21.277 --> 01:49:23.345
- Oh. Uh-oh.
- Oh!

01:49:24.514 --> 01:49:26.780
- Gnarly!
- You all right?

01:49:26.782 --> 01:49:28.550
Let's go, get him up.

01:49:28.552 --> 01:49:30.252
- Get his, get his shoulders.
- You okay?

01:49:30.254 --> 01:49:32.319
Here. Hold up.
