<i>- Does everybody know what time it is?
- Tool Time!</i>

00:04.738 --> 00:09.607
That's right. Binford Tools is proud to
present, Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor!

00:15.749 --> 00:17.216
Hey!

00:18.418 --> 00:21.046
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

00:21.121 --> 00:24.147
Thank you, everybody.
Good audience. Thank you, Heidi.

00:24.224 --> 00:28.160
Welcome to ''Tool Time.'' l...
l am Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.992
And, of course, you all know
my assistant Al Borland!

00:31.064 --> 00:32.964
- [audience cheers]
- [applause]

00:33.033 --> 00:34.898
Thank you.

00:34.968 --> 00:37.266
Thank you.
And welcome to our salute...

00:37.337 --> 00:39.430
[engine revs]

00:39.506 --> 00:40.939
...to engines.

00:41.808 --> 00:45.107
Today we're gonna tell you
how to put a little kick in your V8.

00:45.178 --> 00:49.137
l'll tell you how
l put a kick in my V8... vodka!

00:49.249 --> 00:50.910
[audience laughs]

00:51.251 --> 00:53.412
We're talking about V8 engines.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.387
We'll be showing you the difference
between a stock V8

00:56.456 --> 01:00.085
and a high-performance lndy car engine.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.219
- [audience] Ooh...
- [Tim] Yeah!

01:02.295 --> 01:05.856
And who better to talk about
these engines than our first guest,

01:05.965 --> 01:09.924
a racing legend, put them together,
ladies and gentlemen, for Al Unser!

01:10.036 --> 01:13.472
- [audience cheers, applauds]
- [band plays introduction]

01:18.411 --> 01:20.504
- [band stops playing]
- Great to be here.

01:20.580 --> 01:24.641
Uh... sure it is, son. But l'm talking
about the other Al Unser!

01:24.717 --> 01:27.686
[band plays]

01:30.256 --> 01:32.190
- [band stops]
- Great to be here, Tim.

01:32.258 --> 01:36.160
Yeah, l'm sure it is. But l'm talking
about the other Al Unser!

01:36.229 --> 01:40.393
- [band plays]
- [audience cheers]

01:40.834 --> 01:43.359
- [band stops]
- Thank you for having us here, Tim.

01:43.436 --> 01:46.599
Ladies and gentlemen,
three generations of Al Unsers.

01:49.642 --> 01:52.611
l'll tell you, this could get confusing.
What do l call you?

01:52.712 --> 01:56.808
- [all] Al.
- Well, that clears that up.

01:56.883 --> 02:00.842
l'm Al, Senior. This is Al, Junior.
And this is just Al.

02:01.521 --> 02:03.785
Well, you're never ''just an Al.''

02:04.491 --> 02:07.619
- Great to have you on the show.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Borland.

02:07.694 --> 02:10.389
Oh, please! Let's not be so ''form-Al.''

02:12.866 --> 02:15.835
<i>You see, around Tool Time
we're pretty ''casu-Al.''</i>

02:17.137 --> 02:20.573
[chuckles] Keep that up and ''A'll''
be ripping up your contract.

02:21.841 --> 02:24.309
What brings you gentlemen
to the big Motor City?

02:24.377 --> 02:27.835
Al's doing some testing at
the Michigan lnternational Speedway.

02:27.914 --> 02:30.007
And Al's gonna be going with me.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.847
And Al is doing some go-cart racing.

02:32.919 --> 02:36.878
Uh, there... Al... that Al.
You must be pretty proud of the boy.

02:36.956 --> 02:38.924
My older son gets his license today.

02:39.025 --> 02:41.186
- Cool!
- Congratulations. lt's a big day.

02:41.294 --> 02:42.659
- Have a cigar.
- Yeah.

02:42.762 --> 02:45.322
Enough shilly-shallying.
Let's talk engines.

02:45.431 --> 02:48.594
''Shilly-shallying''?
l'm ''shorry'' you had to hear that.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.794
Come on over here, guys.

02:50.870 --> 02:54.806
All right. Just generally, tell us
the difference between a racing engine

02:54.874 --> 02:57.240
- and a passenger car engine, Al.
- [Als talk]

02:57.343 --> 03:00.676
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Um... l'm talking about this Al.

03:00.747 --> 03:04.012
Well, it's a methanol engine
instead of a gas-burning engine.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.610
And l believe the heads
are made from ''Al-luminum.''

03:09.122 --> 03:11.647
- lt's my favorite ''Al-loy.''
- [audience laughs]

03:11.724 --> 03:14.454
- Al should take it from here now.
- Which Al?

03:14.527 --> 03:15.892
That Al.

03:15.995 --> 03:18.088
Well, actually,
Al knows more than l do.

03:18.164 --> 03:19.859
- Which Al?
- Big Al.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.423
- My Al?
- His Al.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.366
- Which Al?
- Al's Al.

03:23.436 --> 03:25.301
All right, stop! This...

03:25.371 --> 03:28.863
- l got it. What's your middle names?
- [all Als] We don't have any.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.876
- Shoe size?
- [both] Nine.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.506
- lnseam?
- [both] Thirty-two.

03:35.481 --> 03:39.850
l got an idea. Come here. You tell us
the difference between the engines.

03:39.919 --> 03:42.888
l'm just a kid.
You'll have to ask Al.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.249
- Al, help me out.
- [all] OK.

03:48.461 --> 03:50.986

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:37.243 --> 04:39.609
- Good morning.
- There he is.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.374
Ready for your driver's test?

04:41.447 --> 04:44.109
l've been ready ever since
Dad woke me up at 4:00a.m.

04:44.183 --> 04:46.413
He was so excited he couldn't sleep.

04:46.819 --> 04:48.844
Well, to get you off to a good start,

04:48.921 --> 04:52.084
l made you a nice,
solid breakfast.

04:56.129 --> 05:00.088
So solid you need
a jackhammer to get through it.

05:00.166 --> 05:04.535
[sighs] l'm too nervous to eat anything.
l just want to get this test over with.

05:04.604 --> 05:08.301
Me, too. The sooner you pass,
the sooner you can drive me places.

05:09.575 --> 05:12.874
You know, he's not getting his license
so he can drive you around.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.072
So, you driving me
to the movies tonight?

05:15.148 --> 05:18.640
Forget it. You kids want everything
handed to you on a platter.

05:20.253 --> 05:23.745
Oh, yeah, Brad.
Times have changed since you were a kid.

05:24.057 --> 05:28.118
Just don't bug me. l gotta relax.
Just hope l pass this test.

05:28.194 --> 05:29.525
You'll do fine.

05:29.595 --> 05:32.155
lf you don't pass this time,
you can take it again.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.789
Ooh, bite your tongue.

05:33.866 --> 05:37.700
- What do you mean ''if he doesn't pass?''
- Tim, don't pressure him.

05:37.770 --> 05:42.230
Taylor men have always passed
their driver's test first time out.

05:43.976 --> 05:45.671
Except your Uncle Marty.

05:45.745 --> 05:48.441
First Taylor to break tradition.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.881
And to this very day,
he's been hounded constantly.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.913
- By who?
- Me.

05:56.289 --> 05:59.725
Let's get out of here. Hanging
around here makes me more nervous.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.350
Just relax. Relax. Relax.

06:01.461 --> 06:05.090
You're gonna pass this test
with flying colors.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.325
lf you don't,
your father won't hound you.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.765
That's what we're here for.

06:11.904 --> 06:15.465
l'm sorry, Patty. We'll have to meet
your boyfriend another time.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.907
Brad's taking his driver's test today.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.843
Yeah, if he passes,
we're gonna go out and celebrate.

06:20.913 --> 06:23.882
Oh, good! There's Brad and Tim.
l'll call you back. Bye!

06:23.950 --> 06:25.918
- The tradition continues!
- l passed!

06:25.985 --> 06:27.885
So did l!

06:31.290 --> 06:33.850
l took the test again
just for the hell of it.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.258
l am so proud of you.
Congratulations!

06:36.329 --> 06:39.093
- How do you feel about me?
- Words can't describe it.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.157
Let me see.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.601
You have one of the most important
documents you'll ever receive.

06:44.670 --> 06:48.037
- Yeah? What about his marriage license?
- Like l said...

06:48.975 --> 06:53.036
We're gonna celebrate tonight.
So, you get to pick the place.

06:53.112 --> 06:57.048
Actually, l told some guys l'd go out
and celebrate with them if l passed.

06:57.116 --> 06:59.676
- Oh.
- You don't mind, do you, honey?

06:59.786 --> 07:02.254
- l guess not.
- So, where are we going?

07:04.690 --> 07:06.715
Like l said, it's me and the guys.

07:06.793 --> 07:09.353
You don't mind, do you, honey?

07:10.563 --> 07:13.327
We're going to the basketball
game and then for pizza.

07:13.399 --> 07:15.162
- l got the Nomad, right?
- Have fun.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.237
[repeating] Wait, wait, wait!
Just that? Have fun?

07:18.304 --> 07:21.171
- You're not gonna lay down rules?
- l'm getting to that.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.505
All right. Obey all traffic laws,
especially no speeding.

07:24.577 --> 07:28.513
Keep that seat belt fastened. No kids
drinking, smoking. No sex, no drugs.

07:28.581 --> 07:31.744
- Or anything else.
- What else is there?

07:31.851 --> 07:34.342
Plenty. Alright.

07:34.420 --> 07:38.186
No oval shots in parking lots
or doing doughnuts in people's lawns.

07:38.257 --> 07:40.555
And absolutely, absolutely...

07:40.626 --> 07:43.094
...no mooning
while the car's in gear.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.627
- What about when it's not?
- Use your best judgment.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.899
Look, this is kind of
a scary thing for a mom,

07:51.971 --> 07:54.132
her son's first night out driving.

07:54.207 --> 07:58.234
So, l want you to call me at 8:00
on the dot to let me know you're OK.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.074
- Alright, fine.
- ln by 1 1 :00?

08:00.179 --> 08:03.478
- 1 0:00.
- 1 0:00? My normal curfew's at eleven.

08:03.549 --> 08:06.916
You want to be treated like an adult,
do what your mother tells you.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.354
- Hi, girl.
- Hi.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.884
Oh. This is Doug.
This is Jill.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.791
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.693
- This is Tim, Doug.
- Tim Taylor.

08:17.763 --> 08:20.129
- Nice to see you.
- l'm glad you could make it.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.669
Brad decided to drive his friends
to the basketball game.

08:23.736 --> 08:26.705
He said that he's gonna
call here right at 8:00 sharp.

08:26.772 --> 08:29.741
So, if this phone rings,
will we hear it?

08:31.577 --> 08:33.943
Jill, there's nothing
to be nervous about.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.345
- l'm not nervous.
- [timer dings]

08:36.414 --> 08:39.475
- Brad? Oh?
- No, no, no. Oven timer.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.484
- OK, OK, yes. l'm a little jumpy.
- Yeah.

08:43.556 --> 08:47.048
l don't know why. l just have a
feeling something bad's gonna happen.

08:47.126 --> 08:49.890
He'll be fine. Our son got
his driver's license today.

08:49.996 --> 08:54.092
Whoa! The most important document
he'll ever receive, huh?

08:54.166 --> 08:57.932
Alright. You know, l think
l like this guy you're dating.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.473
Oh, good. Because your approval
means everything to me.

09:03.175 --> 09:04.938
Jill, what can l get you to drink?

09:05.044 --> 09:07.979
Oh, red wine, white wine,
anything, whatever... liquor.

09:10.483 --> 09:13.509
- Tim?
- Um... a light scotch.

09:13.586 --> 09:16.248
Scotch for ''The Tool Man.''

09:16.322 --> 09:18.984
l gotta tell you,
everybody at work loves your show.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.424
- Where do you work?
- l'm a general contractor.

09:21.527 --> 09:22.494
No kidding?

09:22.595 --> 09:26.087
Doug is helping build Stan's
Polish restaurant in Highland Park.

09:26.165 --> 09:29.328
- l love those kielbasas, boy! Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:29.435 --> 09:32.768
l hope you're putting a heavy-duty
exhaust fan in that bathroom.

09:35.541 --> 09:39.602
Oh, yeah. l put a 1 1 5-volt
ball-bearing motor with an auto reset.

09:39.679 --> 09:42.239
[grunting] Oh, yeah!

09:42.315 --> 09:45.375
That'll suck the fumes
right out of ya!

09:46.786 --> 09:48.811
The guy knows his ventilation.

09:48.888 --> 09:50.981
That's what l look for in a guy.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.081
Oh, thank you.

09:52.158 --> 09:55.127
So, your son just got
his license, huh?

09:55.194 --> 09:56.525
Oh, yeah.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.531
There's nothing like
a guy's first night with a car.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.090
- l'll never forget mine.
- Why? What was it like?

10:02.168 --> 10:04.136
Well, l had a '66 Lincoln.

10:04.236 --> 10:07.728
- With the suicide doors!
- [Doug] lt was a tank.

10:07.807 --> 10:11.766
We crammed about 1 4 people into it and
drag raced a buddy into the next county.

10:11.844 --> 10:14.745
We had to be going 1 20 miles an hour.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.116
A hundred-and-twenty miles per hour?

10:20.186 --> 10:22.654
Well, we slowed down
to moon the pedestrians.

10:25.992 --> 10:28.859
l think we've heard enough
about your first night out.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.793
Wait, let me tell you about mine.

10:30.863 --> 10:33.923
l had this old Catalina.
lt had a big 421 , marvelous car.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.969
Packed my buddies in,
drove around figuring out what to do.

10:37.069 --> 10:40.630
We decided we were gonna race
a freight train. So, we get...

10:42.808 --> 10:45.276
Then we realized
we had all these overdue books

10:45.344 --> 10:47.676
that should go back to the library.

10:48.414 --> 10:49.904
And, uh...

10:49.982 --> 10:53.941
...then went over to my Aunt Winnie's
for Bible study and hot chocolate.

10:58.524 --> 11:02.426
Well, there you go. lt's after 8:00.
Brad still hasn't called.

11:03.696 --> 11:06.392
lt's 8:03. Why are you so worried?

11:06.465 --> 11:08.831
Two words, ''freight train.''

11:09.402 --> 11:12.166
First, freight trains
don't run around here anymore.

11:12.271 --> 11:15.536
And second, Brad is a lot more
responsible than l was at his age.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.633
- You know, that's true.
- [Tim] Yes.

11:17.710 --> 11:20.270
Brad's pretty calm and rational.
Just like me.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.847
- [telephone rings]
- That's Brad!

11:24.050 --> 11:26.280
Since it's my apartment,
it might be for me.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.842
Hello?

11:27.920 --> 11:30.753
OK. Just calm down.
Tell me everything that happened.

11:30.823 --> 11:33.053
lt's Brad. What is it? What's wrong?

11:33.926 --> 11:37.418
Mother, if you just had a root canal,
why are you eating Gummy Bears?

11:40.399 --> 11:42.765
Stop obsessing.
You'll make yourself sick.

11:42.835 --> 11:45.599
Mom, you have to hold on.
l've got another call.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.240
Hello?

11:49.308 --> 11:50.866
Oh, my God!

11:50.943 --> 11:53.241
l knew it! Something's happened to Brad!

11:53.312 --> 11:56.247
A baby girl?

11:56.315 --> 11:58.215
My son had a baby girl.

12:01.587 --> 12:04.522
That was a very good meal, Patty.
Don't you think so, Jill?

12:04.590 --> 12:08.651
Oh, yeah. Really, really good.
OK. l know why he hasn't called.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.423
He was on his way to the game.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.964
One of the other kids said,
''Let's go to a party.''

12:13.032 --> 12:16.160
So, now they're smoking dope
and driving a 1 80 miles an hour

12:16.235 --> 12:19.204
with their butts all smushed up
against the windows.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.968
Well, you know, the Nomad's
the perfect car for it.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.510
Lots of big windows. Yeah!

12:26.312 --> 12:28.337
How can you joke
at a time like this?

12:28.414 --> 12:31.247
Where was that phone call?
lt's not like him not to call.

12:31.317 --> 12:34.445
lt's a big night for him.
He's probably looking for a phone.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.987
l know what we should do.

12:36.055 --> 12:40.424
We should call the school and have him
just paged at the basketball game.

12:43.195 --> 12:45.629
- Well, that would go over big.
- [spoon clinks]

12:45.698 --> 12:48.462
Johnson shoots a three-pointer.
What a shot that was!

12:48.534 --> 12:51.765
Look at...oh, hold on a minute.
Yeah. Yup. Yup. OK.

12:51.837 --> 12:54.670
Brad Taylor, your mommy's on the phone.

12:56.142 --> 12:58.167
l know something's wrong.

12:58.244 --> 13:01.270
- lt's just... a mother's instinct.
- Mother's paranoia.

13:01.347 --> 13:04.783
Don't dismiss my feelings.
Would you like to be dismissed?

13:04.850 --> 13:07.318
Yes, l would.

13:07.386 --> 13:10.549
Help me out here, Doug.
Tell her she's overreacting, please.

13:10.656 --> 13:13.989
lt's a little stuffy in here.
Why don't l check the ventilation?

13:14.059 --> 13:17.153
The air is fine! The only problem
is Brad might be in trouble.

13:17.229 --> 13:19.925
- And Tim doesn't care. Right, Patty?
- You're right.

13:19.999 --> 13:23.162
l detect a little airborne mold.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.829
<i>- [phone rings]
- That had better be him.</i>

13:25.938 --> 13:27.906
Hello? Hi, Brad.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.873
There he is.
Everything's all right.

13:29.942 --> 13:32.308
- Uh-huh.
- ls everything OK?

13:32.411 --> 13:34.879
Hold on.

13:34.947 --> 13:37.609
Uh... Brad's been in a little accident.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.309
Oh, god!

13:44.924 --> 13:48.360
All you're saying is that you bumped
the car into a telephone pole?

13:48.427 --> 13:51.863
No, honey. The important thing
is that nobody got hurt.

13:51.931 --> 13:55.458
- Thank God.
- Listen, we're gonna come right home.

13:55.534 --> 13:58.867
OK. We love you. Bye-bye.

13:59.605 --> 14:02.836
- l am so relieved.
- So am l. How's the car?

14:02.908 --> 14:04.967
l don't know. l didn't ask him.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.274
- What do you mean?
- Who cares about the car?

14:07.346 --> 14:11.009
- lt's a classic Nomad.
- l was more concerned about our son.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.813
l was concerned, but he's OK.
l just wanna know the damage.

14:13.886 --> 14:18.323
Well, it couldn't be as bad as when you
dropped that three-ton beam on it.

14:18.390 --> 14:21.621
Wait. You dropped a beam
on a classic Nomad?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.389
Yeah, yeah. You know...

14:23.462 --> 14:26.829
...the up side was l got to cherry it
out, l dropped a big block in it.

14:26.899 --> 14:30.391
- Oh, man! l sure hope that car's OK.
- Doug. Shut up.

14:31.837 --> 14:34.271
- Doug, nice to meet you.
- Yeah, same here.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.807
- Bye. Thanks.
- Bye.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.641
- l'm glad Brian wasn't hurt.
- His name is Brad.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.180
lt rhymes with Nomad.
That's how l remember.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.409
- Oh.
- [Jill mouthing] l'm sorry.

14:45.651 --> 14:46.913
You hit a car?

14:46.986 --> 14:49.250
Yeah. l rear-ended a guy
over on Woodworth.

14:49.321 --> 14:51.482
How come you told
Mom and Dad you hit a pole?

14:51.590 --> 14:53.683
Because l enjoy breathing?

14:53.759 --> 14:56.319
The guy said if l gave him $400,
he wouldn't tell.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.556
- And you're off the hook?
- Exactly.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.395
As soon as you guys loan me $200.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.833
Well, don't you mean us kids?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.532
Yeah. What do we get out of it?

15:07.606 --> 15:10.336
We get Brad to be our
personal chauffeur.

15:10.409 --> 15:14.072
Hey! Maybe he could wear
a uniform and a little hat.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.804
l like it.

15:17.049 --> 15:20.018
Oh, Brad! l'm glad you're all right.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.446
- You're all right? Sure?
- Yeah.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.782
Oh, boy! Well...

15:27.860 --> 15:30.920
...oh, it's not as bad as l thought.
Just the bumper here.

15:30.996 --> 15:34.659
A broken headlight. ls this green paint?
You said you hit a phone pole.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.963
Yeah. The pole was green.

15:37.536 --> 15:39.663
The color of money.

15:42.975 --> 15:46.934
l'm really sorry. Take the money out
of my account and pay for the bumper.

15:47.046 --> 15:49.571
That's all right.
lt's just a minor deal.

15:49.648 --> 15:51.980
Eddie owes me a favor
down at the body shop.

15:52.051 --> 15:55.953
You gotta be more careful, Brad. Next
time this could be a serious accident.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.717
[sighs] Honey, this was a fluke.
He's a great driver.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.884
lt's not like he hit a car, right?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.222
Right.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.125
[tires screech]

16:05.097 --> 16:08.760
Thanks for the ride. As soon as l get
a snack, l'm gonna need another lift.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.563
[sighs]

16:10.636 --> 16:14.128
- Now where am l taking you?
- l don't know. Surprise me.

16:16.442 --> 16:19.878
l love the way you're driving
your brother around. lt's a big help.

16:19.945 --> 16:22.641
Oh, yeah. That's why l'm
doing it. To help you.

16:22.915 --> 16:26.282
Well, thanks. Listen, guys,
l have to go to school.

16:26.352 --> 16:29.185
Oh, we never got to celebrate
you getting your license.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.916
So, why don't we
take you to dinner tonight?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.221
- You don't have to do it.
- l know. l want to.

16:34.293 --> 16:37.854
l mean, you had a little accident.
But, you were honest about it.

16:37.930 --> 16:41.491
You learned something from it.
Ultimately, it had a positive effect.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.966
Yes, it has.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.832
OK. l'll see you guys later.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.531
<i>[phone rings]</i>

16:49.575 --> 16:52.942
Hello? No. Mr. Taylor's not here. Can l
take a message?

16:54.046 --> 16:55.570
Uh, yeah.

16:55.647 --> 16:58.275
George Preston.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.716
Attorney for Michael McGrath.

17:00.819 --> 17:02.582
McGrath! Give me that!

17:02.688 --> 17:04.952
[deep voice] Yes, this is Mr. Taylor.

17:05.023 --> 17:09.085
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Oh, yeah. My son's accident.

17:09.161 --> 17:11.095
[grunts]

17:12.263 --> 17:14.027
He told me that was all settled.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.260
[regular voice] Whiplash?! No way!

17:16.335 --> 17:19.498
[deep voice] Uh, actually,
l'll talk to my son about that, sir.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.367
Thank you.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.968
Sounds like your son's in a
bit of trouble.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.135
[sirens]

17:26.678 --> 17:28.771
[Wilson humming]

17:28.847 --> 17:30.610
Hey, Wilson.
What are you doing?

17:30.682 --> 17:33.150
[Wilson] Well, hi-ho, Taylor teen.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.585
l am sculpting a shrine
out of yak butter.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.053
- Yak butter?
- [Wilson] Mm-hmm.

17:40.125 --> 17:43.026
lt spreads so much easier
than yak margarine.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.858
[laughs]

17:44.963 --> 17:47.431
Actually, making shrines
is a traditional way

17:47.499 --> 17:50.593
of celebrating the Buddhist
prayer festival of Tibet.

17:50.669 --> 17:53.934
Yeah. l've been doing
some praying of my own.

17:54.006 --> 17:57.237
l dented somebody's car.
l'm praying my dad doesn't kill me.

17:57.309 --> 18:01.211
You hit a car?
Your father told me you hit a pole.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.578
- That's what l told him.
- Oh.

18:03.649 --> 18:06.277
l didn't want him to get mad
and take my license away.

18:06.351 --> 18:09.582
Well, Brad, what makes you
think he would've been so strict?

18:09.655 --> 18:12.317
- Driving's everything to my dad.
- Hmm.

18:12.391 --> 18:15.485
He was the youngest member
to ever join Triple A.

18:16.128 --> 18:20.565
Well, l know that. l saw the slides
of his first emergency roadside service.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.898
l'm gonna need a pretty big
tow truck to pull me out of this mess.

18:24.970 --> 18:29.407
So, you're saying that if your father
found out you hit another car,

18:29.475 --> 18:32.035
he would view that
as an unforgivable offense?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.079
Yeah.

18:34.179 --> 18:37.842
Well, Brad, it seems to me he might
consider lying a far worse offense.

18:37.916 --> 18:40.680
So either way,
l'm in deep yak butter.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.346
[SlGH] You know, Brad,

18:44.423 --> 18:49.725
the novelist Han Suyin had some very
choice words for situations like this.

18:49.795 --> 18:53.458
''Truth, like surgery, might hurt.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.557
But it cures.''

18:55.634 --> 19:00.071
Yeah. My mom and dad also have a few
choice words for situations like this.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.505
But, l'm not allowed to say 'em.

19:05.777 --> 19:08.041
Dad, l need to talk to you
about something.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.843
- l think l know what you're gonna say.
- You do?

19:10.916 --> 19:15.751
Yup. For dinner tonight, you
want a big steak. Thick and fatty.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.984
A big baked potato,
smothered in sour cream and butter.

19:19.057 --> 19:21.685
And a three-pound onion loaf.

19:22.227 --> 19:24.195
- Actually...
- Hey, guys.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.730
Brad, where do you want to go
to dinner tonight?

19:26.798 --> 19:30.461
No girlie salad bar.
This boy is screaming for meat.

19:31.303 --> 19:34.431
Look, l need to talk to you
guys about the accident l had.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.667
l didn't hit a pole,
l hit a car.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.945
- You hit what?
- Why didn't you tell us?

19:41.013 --> 19:44.744
Well, l didn't want you to get mad at me
and take my license away.

19:44.816 --> 19:47.046
You thought you'd lie
and get away with it?

19:47.119 --> 19:51.647
l guess so. Plus the guy said if l gave
him $400, he'd forget the whole thing.

19:51.723 --> 19:55.022
- What guy?
- The guy in the other car who's suing.

19:55.093 --> 19:58.460
- What?
- [repeating] Wait! Wait!

20:00.532 --> 20:03.660
[stammers] Back the sue canoe up here!

20:03.735 --> 20:05.999
l need the whole story,
the truth right now.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.096
The guy in front of me hit his brakes.

20:08.173 --> 20:11.301
l couldn't stop fast enough,
so l swerved and bumped into him.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.675
He said he was fine. But his lawyer
called today, he's suing us...

20:14.746 --> 20:16.441
...says he has whiplash.

20:16.515 --> 20:18.881
- l don't believe it.
- Neither do l.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.647
No one gets whiplash.
lt's just a scam.

20:22.621 --> 20:26.455
No. l mean about Brad.
l can't believe that you lied to us.

20:26.525 --> 20:28.618
[quietly] l'm sorry.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.218
Well, sorry doesn't cut it!

20:30.295 --> 20:32.855
We gave you the keys to the car
and our trust.

20:32.931 --> 20:35.627
- You blew it.
- What if this had been a big accident?

20:35.701 --> 20:39.000
lf somebody was killed or hurt,
would you have kept that from us?

20:39.071 --> 20:43.098
Look, l know l made a mistake. And l'm
ready to accept the consequences.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.733
- [Jill sighs]
- Good!

20:44.843 --> 20:47.903
- You're not driving for 30 days.
- Thirty days?

20:47.980 --> 20:49.743
That sounds fair.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.408
What did l tell you? Mother's instinct.

20:53.485 --> 20:58.218
First night out driving,
has an accident, tells a big fat lie.

20:58.290 --> 21:01.191
Well, at least we got them
both all out in one night.

21:01.827 --> 21:06.127
He's got years of driving ahead of him.
And we still got two kids to go.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.692
When the other boys are driving,
will you be a nervous wreck?

21:09.768 --> 21:12.635
No. Just when l have an instinct.

21:12.704 --> 21:15.332
- Well, when will that be?
- l don't know.

21:15.407 --> 21:19.036
- That's why they call it an instinct.
- [laughs]

21:19.111 --> 21:21.807
Don't you have any worries
about our boys driving?

21:21.880 --> 21:24.508
Of course l have worries
about them driving.

21:24.583 --> 21:28.679
l'm worried they'll be as
bad a driver as l was at that age.

21:28.754 --> 21:31.985
That story l told you at Patty's
about going to the library...

21:32.057 --> 21:35.026
- Yeah.
-[false crying] lt wasn't true.

21:35.994 --> 21:38.462
- Yeah. l figured that out.
- What gave it away?

21:38.530 --> 21:41.465
Tim, have you ever
been near a library?

21:42.901 --> 21:44.459
Yes.

21:44.536 --> 21:47.903
Well, the parking lot.
That's where l learned to do donuts.

21:53.412 --> 21:56.677
<i>Welcome back to the final day of
''Engine Week'' here on Tool Time.</i>

21:56.748 --> 21:59.581
To end it with a bang,
we brought back our special guests

21:59.651 --> 22:02.085
- you met earlier in the week.
- Yes, we did.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.521
This time l made a few changes to make
this show easier to follow.

22:05.624 --> 22:08.092
Let's bring out the Al's.
Come on, everybody!

22:15.500 --> 22:19.596
[Tim] No confusion now. You have Big Al,
Little Al, Norm-Al. And, of course...

22:19.671 --> 22:21.832
...Abnorm-Al.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.873
l don't think so, Tim.
