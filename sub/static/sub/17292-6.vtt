[Rebecca]
<i>Previously on </i>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:03.002 --> 00:05.589
-[Heather] <i>So, you and V are good now?</i>
-[Rebecca] <i>Yeah.</i>

00:05.672 --> 00:08.926
I always knew I kinda liked you.
You're basic but in an enjoyable way.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.886
-So you're hanging out with--
-Uh, yeah.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.263
-Yeah, they're kinda like my bitches now.
-I'm Sunil Odav.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.974
This is kind of embarrassing,
but you two are wearing the same bracelet.

00:16.058 --> 00:17.434
Yeah, they're friendship bracelets.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.103
Oh! Oh, oh, okay.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.605
Uh, I gotta go.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.274
[Rebecca] <i>You did not see his face</i>
<i>when he left my apartment that day.</i>

00:24.358 --> 00:27.236
I was dead to him. Like, he didn't want
to spend any more time with me.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.196
I promise you, I'm gonna fix this.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.031
All we need is some random guy

00:31.114 --> 00:34.076
who went to Harvard at the same time
you did and lives in Los Angeles.

00:34.159 --> 00:37.204
Ooh! Trent. Oh, that's a perfect name
for a fake boyfriend.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.289
Trent! Baby!

00:39.373 --> 00:43.919
-Are you gonna kill me?
-No! Why would I kill you? I love you.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.504
-This isn't happening.
-Right.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.381
You're not--
We're not gonna have a relationship.

the cropped hoodies,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.964
the sleeveless hoodies,
and then just some plain hoods.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.632
And with the eight pairs of sunglasses,

01:30.716 --> 01:33.760
the waterproof dive watch

01:39.182 --> 01:40.183
Thank you, sir.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.270
Please, call me "bro."

01:45.022 --> 01:48.817
-Planning a big surfing trip, bro?
-No, I hate the ocean.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.403
I'm so scared of water,
I spot wash in the shower.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.530
I almost drowned in a pool
when I was little.

01:53.614 --> 01:58.076
I'm just in town to infiltrate,
or should I say "in-chill-trate,"

01:58.160 --> 02:00.621
a certain bro friend group.

02:00.704 --> 02:04.833
It's part one of a 42-point plan
that I call "The Bunch Inception."

02:04.916 --> 02:08.587
And it starts with me getting in
with this group of dudes.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.881
Well, if you ask me,
forcing friendships never works.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.885
Oh, and if you ask me,
I didn't ask you, surf shop lady.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.850
[indistinct chatter]

02:21.933 --> 02:24.144
Dude, move up.
Quit texting your new girlfriend.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.396
Um, Anna is not my new girlfriend.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.273
We've only been out
on three amazing dates.

02:28.357 --> 02:32.277
You were single for a brutal 11 minutes.
I'm glad you finally found somebody.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.278
[scoffs]

02:33.362 --> 02:36.740
Hey! Sorry, guys. It's finals. New policy.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.868
A hundred and fifty bucks for a table.
Fifty bucks for the bar.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.162
It's like Vegas. Models and bottles.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.458
-A cover charge? At Home Base?
-Look, I love you, guys.

02:46.541 --> 02:50.337
I appreciate your masculine bonhomie,
but times are tough.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.922
Finals are my moneymaker.

02:52.005 --> 02:55.384
-Oh, come on! Kevin, just this once?
-And also, tomorrow night?

02:55.467 --> 02:57.469
And also, always
until the finals are over?

02:58.177 --> 03:02.516
Look, if you can't afford it,
please just go.

03:02.599 --> 03:06.895
I can't stand seeing the sadness
in your eyes. It hurts my heart.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.816
-All right.
-I thought we were boys.

03:10.899 --> 03:15.028
Oh, my God, I lurve having someone to go
to the bathroom with. Stall sisters!

03:15.112 --> 03:17.823
That's sweet, but next time when you gotta
go number two, close the door, okay?

03:17.906 --> 03:21.618
Uh, okay, but just so you know, like,
when I disarm the whole security system,

03:21.702 --> 03:23.537
it's like the backdoor unlocks
with the front.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.914
-Know what I'm sayin'?
-You talk about pooping a lot.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.834
-What up, thirsty hoes?
-Hey! Oh, my God!

03:28.917 --> 03:32.295
Heather, thank you for snagging us
the best table in the place.

03:32.379 --> 03:36.007
Yeah, my girl Heath hooked us up
for the finals of something.

03:36.091 --> 03:40.595
Ladies, if I may have permission to be
just a wee bit hyperbolic for a second.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.348
I've had the best time
hanging out with the both of you.

03:43.432 --> 03:47.728
Like, I think it's official
that we're a squad, right?

03:47.811 --> 03:50.647
We're like Sotomayor,
Bader Ginsburg, and Kagan.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.442
-Um, yeah.
-Yeah.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.486
This is so cool. I've never been part
of a girl group like this.

03:56.570 --> 04:00.323
If peeing together is fun,
I can't wait for the next activities.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.742
[both]
Squee!

04:01.825 --> 04:03.452
Yeah, I've also never had a girl group,

04:03.535 --> 04:06.163
and that's 'cause studies show that women
tend to be indirect communicators

04:06.246 --> 04:07.414
and I'm too direct.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.124
Speaking of which, here is a mint

04:09.207 --> 04:11.543
because your breath
doesn't smell, like, amazing.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.712
Oh...

04:13.795 --> 04:16.506
Look at that.
Look at how you helped her.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.091
You know what?
When we stick together,

04:18.175 --> 04:20.302
I'm pretty convinced
there's nothing we can't do.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.471
Like, I don't know.
We could just take over the world.

04:22.554 --> 04:23.555
Totally.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.640
-[gasps] Oh, my God. I didn't tell you.
-What?

04:25.724 --> 04:28.935
[fading out] My name is actually Maria.
I have to tell everyone this.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.147
[British accent] You have now entered
the world of the Best Friend Squad.

04:32.230 --> 04:35.817
And when you have friends
that are this best, you feel unstoppable.

04:35.901 --> 04:40.030
Unstoppable. So prepare to surrender
to the power of friendship.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.699
'Cause we're gonna take over the world.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.327
Like, actually-- We are actually
going to take over the world.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.912
Well, just-- just look over there.

Chin down. Pucker. Mm.

06:42.152 --> 06:42.986
[camera clicks]

06:43.069 --> 06:45.030
I think that was good.
Let's approve it, yeah?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.114
[all]
Approved.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.406
-Yeah, I love the signing.
-Yeah.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.742
-Yeah, it was solid.
-What filter?

06:48.825 --> 06:50.327
-Um, Valencia.
-Valencia.

06:50.409 --> 06:52.829
Oh! Duh!

06:52.913 --> 06:57.751
-So this is your girl group, huh?
-Oh, yeah, that's us.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.086
And we spelled girl with a "U."
Isn't that cute?

07:00.170 --> 07:02.672
-Really cute.
-That seems a bit exclusion-y.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.883
I mean, since you do have
other close friends.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.010
Oh, wait, Darryl,
are you talking about Paula? Yes, and others.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.139
Oh, Darryl, come on, don't start.

07:11.222 --> 07:14.643
There might also be other others
who would enjoy being included.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.227
Maya, don't start.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.815
Darryl, you don't-- you don't think that
Paula feels left out by that photo, right?

07:20.899 --> 07:23.109
She doesn't feel like I've replaced her.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.695
Well, I can't speak for Paula,

07:25.779 --> 07:28.406
but getting back to the others
that might be hurt by this photo--

07:28.490 --> 07:29.574
OMG. I think you're right.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.535
Look at-- Look at her. Look how sad
she is. She totally feels left out.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.415
God, what am I doing? What am I doing?
I've completely broken her heart.

07:37.499 --> 07:41.378
I'm-- I'm a complete monster.
After everything she's done for me.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.214
[exhales]
Okay. Okay, okay. I can still fix this.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.550
I can totally fix this because
all I have to do is blend my old friend

07:47.634 --> 07:50.053
somehow into my new friends,
like some sort of friend jambalaya.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.597
Well, why don't you just invite Paula
and your new friends

07:52.681 --> 07:56.393
and any really cool co-workers
that you have

07:56.476 --> 07:58.269
and just take them on a little soirée?

07:58.353 --> 07:59.729
-No.
-And then boom...

07:59.813 --> 08:01.815
you've got a spicy friend-y stew.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.109
No, Darryl, I love you,
but that will never work, okay?

08:04.192 --> 08:07.028
You just can't glom a bunch of girls
together who have nothing in common.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.614
It'll feel gross and forced. Ew.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.409
No, what I have to do
is make it spontaneous and surprising,

08:12.492 --> 08:14.202
like, "Oh, look who happens to be here.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.079
You happen to be here,
you happen to be here.

08:16.162 --> 08:19.040
What a fun, spontaneous,
not forced blend of Rebecca's friends."

08:19.124 --> 08:21.334
-And how are you gonna do that?
-I don't know, Darryl.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.712
-Just stop starting.
-Fine.

08:23.795 --> 08:24.754
[sighs]

08:24.838 --> 08:27.257
Word on the street is,
you have a super fun girl group.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.300
Girl with a "U." Sassy.

08:29.384 --> 08:33.847
I know something really fun
that all girl groups love.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.224
Naughty toy parties.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.436
My fabulous friend, Angelique,
throws them.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.689
She is such a character.
The girls have the best time.

08:42.772 --> 08:47.527
She brings everyone together,
all different types of girls.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.154
Think about it.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.584
Rah! Peanut monster!

09:02.667 --> 09:05.420
Oh, oh. I'm sorry.
I-I thought you were my boss.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.006
Oh, all good, bro. I think I'm lost.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.967
Someone up front told me
there's a bathroom back here somewhere?

09:11.051 --> 09:16.222
Oh, yeah. It's, um... It's right around
the corner. Wait, don't I know you?

09:16.306 --> 09:18.808
Oh, I don't know.
Do you hang ten at the beach?

09:18.892 --> 09:22.562
Totally. Hold up. I do know you.

09:22.645 --> 09:26.649
You're the guy who was dating Rebecca.
You had a cool name?

09:26.733 --> 09:28.902
Oh, it's Trent.
You take out the T, it's Rent.

09:28.985 --> 09:32.363
You take out the R, it's Tent.
It's an easy way to remember it, you know?

09:33.239 --> 09:35.909
-And you're... Josh, right?
-Yeah.

09:35.992 --> 09:39.746
Wait, uh, don't you live in L.A.?
How come you're all the way out here?

09:39.829 --> 09:42.624
Oh, I've been doing
some tech consulting in Azusa.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.210
So, lately, I've just been chilling
in the San Gabes Vals.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.755
"San Gabes Vals." Dope. Stealing that.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.758
All yours, bro. [chuckles]
I'll see you around town, okay?

09:51.841 --> 09:54.052
You gonna be at Home Base
on Friday for the playoffs?

09:54.135 --> 09:56.846
I wanna, but they priced me out.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.848
Bummer, man.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.016
Actually, you know what?

10:00.100 --> 10:03.269
I just bought a table for me
and some clients on my expense account.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.854
There's still room if you want to join.

10:04.938 --> 10:09.234
I mean, I don't want to force anything
because if you ask me, that never works.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.445
Can I bring my friends?
Since it's on your expensive account?

10:12.529 --> 10:16.032
Absolutely, Broheemus Maximus.
I'll see you there.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.325
Cool, cool.

10:17.408 --> 10:20.995
Oh, hey, on your way out,
would you send my boss Alex back here?

10:21.079 --> 10:23.206
But don't tell him why. A'ight?

10:23.289 --> 10:24.624
A'ight.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.018
[sighs]

10:44.102 --> 10:46.771
Hey, Paulsy.
Oh, no. That sounds wrong.

10:46.855 --> 10:50.233
I was wondering if you wanted
some of my croistazzanut?

10:50.316 --> 10:52.819
It's a croissant, a donut, and pizza.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.238
Oh. Oh, no, that's okay, honey.

10:55.321 --> 10:59.117
I'm not hungry. You know, a lot of things
going on. Got a big test coming up. Torts.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.953
-You know how it is. You get it.
-Yeah. Um, hey.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.331
So, I was wondering
what you're up to on Friday night,

11:05.415 --> 11:08.042
um, 'cause I was thinking you could
come over, see my new house.

11:08.126 --> 11:11.254
-We've been working real hard on it.
-Oh. Oh, that sounds really great,

11:11.337 --> 11:14.090
but, I mean, I've got--
I've got the Torts test, so--

11:14.174 --> 11:15.258
-Okay.
-I mean, you know...

11:15.884 --> 11:16.885
But here's the thing.

11:16.968 --> 11:22.056
I really miss you, and I want you to be
a part of my life and see everything.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.185
I want to take you and all
the other wonderful things in my life

11:25.268 --> 11:26.394
and just smoosh them together.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.770
[chuckles]

11:27.854 --> 11:30.398
Well, I mean, it does--
it does sound really nice, actually.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.482
Yeah?

11:31.566 --> 11:35.153
I would love to see your new house.
So, yeah, all right.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.323
Oh, yay! Yay! Okay. Great.

11:38.406 --> 11:44.120
Hey, so, tell your friend Angelique
we are on for Friday night.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.873
-I'm throwing a sex toy party.
-You got it.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.583
And just to be clear, you're not invited.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.543
-You got it.
-Okay.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.965
We have to remember
that federal courts in diversity actions

11:56.049 --> 11:58.259
apply the substantive law
of the state in which they--

11:58.343 --> 12:01.429
Let's just say the word.
Rebecca is needy.

12:01.512 --> 12:05.099
She's MIA and now snaps her fingers
and you just come running?

12:05.183 --> 12:08.727
-Wow, you really don't want to study.
-I'm just trying to help you out.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.605
You're the one who's jeopardizing
your Torts test

12:10.688 --> 12:12.148
by spending time
with your woman child.

12:12.232 --> 12:16.277
Oh, and you haven't even told her about
the decision you made, and everything.

12:16.361 --> 12:20.114
Yeah, well, you know, it's not easy
to wedge an abortion in a conversation.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.366
You just did it.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.161
She is making time for me
and I'm happy about it.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.080
And I will try to tell her. I will.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.416
It's just-- You know, it's hard to tell
people about serious stuff sometimes.

12:30.500 --> 12:35.546
I mean, you know. Wasn't it hard for you
to tell people about your wife's suicide?

12:35.630 --> 12:38.383
I didn't have to.
She left a note on Facebook.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.552
And this was before
all those different "like" options,

12:41.636 --> 12:43.137
so people didn't know what to do.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.228
Okay, so let me give you
the grand tour--

12:50.311 --> 12:51.562
-Yes.
-...of the new place.

12:51.646 --> 12:55.942
Okay, so over here is my bedroom.
That's Heather's bedroom over there.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.904
Bathroom. And this is our kitchen
with brand-new appliances.

12:59.988 --> 13:03.032
Oh... You have an islet.
What are you, a Rockefeller?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.492
-I know, right?
-Oh, my God.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.453
It's so cool. Um, over here
is our kitchen table for food

13:07.537 --> 13:09.247
and heated discourse.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.833
And so, yeah, the whole place
is completely renovated,

13:11.916 --> 13:14.294
so it's basically, like, new.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.921
Whoa! Wow!

13:17.005 --> 13:20.799
Okay, it's not that-- I mean, it's--
Yeah, it's just paint, so--

13:20.883 --> 13:23.428
[gasps]
I know this place.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.973
This is where all those people
were murder--

13:27.056 --> 13:28.474
Look at those sconces! Oh, yeah. Nice, right?

13:30.059 --> 13:32.312
So nice.

13:32.395 --> 13:35.064
Honey, I am so proud of you. Oh...

13:35.148 --> 13:37.358
[moans, giggles]

13:37.442 --> 13:40.320
And you know what? I am really glad
that we finally have the time

13:40.403 --> 13:43.448
to just put our feet up
and, you know, have a nice long chat,

13:43.531 --> 13:45.033
just like we used to.

13:45.116 --> 13:48.786
Um, so chatting is fun,
but you know what else is fun?

13:48.870 --> 13:50.079
No.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.291
-What up, biotch?
-We got the T-shirts.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.169
Yeah! Rebecca, we got you a medium.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.589
I wanted to get you a large
because of your massive boobs, but...

14:00.798 --> 14:05.094
Introducing the newest member
of our girl group, Pa-Pa-Pa-Paula.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.015
[sighs]

14:12.101 --> 14:15.646
[sensual music playing]

14:15.730 --> 14:19.859
Hey, Rebecca. I'm gonna infiltrate
your guy friend group tonight.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.779
So, when, at a future time,
you see me chilling with them,

14:22.862 --> 14:27.450
you'll think,
"He's so normal. I'm in love."

14:49.263 --> 14:51.432
You can do this because you're the best.

14:51.516 --> 14:54.602
All right. Um, we're not on-- Hey, Trent!

14:54.685 --> 14:57.980
Hey, uh, it's cool.
They're with me. They're with me.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.232
Yeah.

Well, these are my boys.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.034
-What's up Hector and White Josh?
-How'd you know our names?

15:10.118 --> 15:11.744
Yeah. Have we met?

15:11.828 --> 15:12.912
Oh, um...

15:12.995 --> 15:14.205
I called you "White Josh"

15:14.288 --> 15:17.583
because you're a white person
who looks like Josh.

15:17.667 --> 15:21.295
And, obviously,
I called you "Hector" because...

15:21.379 --> 15:22.380
I'm racist.

15:23.840 --> 15:24.966
Yeah, that's right.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.511
We got the table to ourselves
for the momento, bromentos.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.721
My clients won't be here for a minute.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.849
You sure it's still chill that we chill?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.767
Dude, of course,
it's still chill that we chill.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.979
First, second, and third rounds
are on me.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.147

Oh!

15:39.230 --> 15:40.064
-Yeah.
-Let's do this.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.066
-Okay. Yeah.
-Whoo!

15:42.859 --> 15:44.694
Okay. That looks great.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.115
Paula, I'm really sorry that I didn't
have a blank T-shirt to work with,

15:49.198 --> 15:51.701
and I had to write on the back,
but I think it looks great.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.828
What T-shirt is that?
What T-shirt is that? Remind me.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.873
Oh, the Breast Cancer Rock and Roll
Walk-Run 5K Parsippany, New Jersey.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.666
That's a great cause. Great organization.

15:58.749 --> 16:03.129
Sorry, I didn't make you a shirt, Paula.
I don't know how these girl groups work.

16:03.212 --> 16:06.215
-Did I do something wrong?
-No, you didn't. You're doing great. What happened was,
Rebecca didn't tell us Paula was coming,

16:09.385 --> 16:11.220
or tell Paula we would be here.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.222
-It's weird.
-Okay.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.017
There's that endearing honesty.
[chuckles]

16:16.100 --> 16:18.853
Okay. Who wants cocktails?

16:24.650 --> 16:26.110
Hey, honey.

16:26.194 --> 16:29.780
Um, I-I don't mean to be a wet blanket,
but, you know,

16:29.864 --> 16:32.783
I just thought that tonight
was gonna be just us,

16:32.867 --> 16:35.828
and, you know, it's just--
I have so much studying to do.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.163
-I have to--
-No, no, no.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.874
Let me cut you off right there.
Please don't leave. Please don't leave.

16:39.957 --> 16:43.669
It's... It's so important to me
that you be here, okay?

16:43.753 --> 16:45.755
And I know why
you're a little weirded out.

16:45.838 --> 16:50.426
I didn't tell you that they'd be here
because I knew you'd make your face.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.971
That face. Just give me an hour.
One hour, okay?

16:54.055 --> 16:57.725
And if we're not all, like, totally
blood sisters by then, you can leave.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.644
No hard feelings. Okay?

16:59.727 --> 17:02.396
-Okay, okay.
-Great! Okay, great.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.982
All right. Hi.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.735
Who's ready to slightly poison
their bodies

17:07.818 --> 17:10.780
and create an artificial sense
of warmth and well-being?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.990
[squeals]
Yeah, isn't this great?

17:13.074 --> 17:16.494
I don't know.
Paula seems a little uncomfortable.

17:16.577 --> 17:20.039
Yeah! Okay. Let's just all take a selfie.
Take a selfie. Let's take a selfie.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.332
-Okay.
-Let's do it.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.000
Everyone get in. Chin down.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.461
-Okay.
-Okay, poker face.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.754
-All right. Paula--
-Paula, just go--

17:26.837 --> 17:28.130
-Find your lens, Paula.
-I can't--

17:28.214 --> 17:29.840
Only your boob is in the lens.

17:29.924 --> 17:34.512
Okay, you know what?
Here! And smile. Done.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.390
It's good.

-What? No. What?

Another girl squad photo. I'm so sad.

17:50.987 --> 17:54.615
I want to be gal pals with Rebecca.
She makes me think women can have it all.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.742
Hey, Maya, has anyone ever told you

17:56.826 --> 17:59.287
that your voice sounds
like a mouse with throat cancer

17:59.370 --> 18:03.708
talking into a little,
tiny mouse voice box?

18:03.791 --> 18:06.460
-Do you get that a lot?
-What? No.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.462
I've never heard that before,
but I'm sorry.

18:08.546 --> 18:09.922
I didn't mean to bother you.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.883
I'm just really sad that I'm not
at Rebecca's house for the fun party.

18:12.967 --> 18:16.304
Sweetheart, listen to me.
You can't force a friendship.

18:16.387 --> 18:17.388
Everyone knows that.

18:17.471 --> 18:21.309
But what if you and I team up
and we find a way into that party?

18:21.392 --> 18:24.478
Me team up with you?
[laughs]

18:24.562 --> 18:27.982
That's just ridiculous.
I would have to be pretty desperate.

20:56.130 --> 21:00.426
Ha! Sorry. Just-- Anna texted me
a picture of a cat dressed up like a dog.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.969
Where does she find this stuff?

21:04.972 --> 21:08.267
Okay, so we're looking for something
that says we're fun and that we're gonna bring
the party up a notch!

21:11.729 --> 21:14.607
So, what can we bring? Hmm?
No, there are no bad ideas.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.609
This is a safe space.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.069
-We could bring a pineapple.
-A pineapple!

21:19.153 --> 21:22.198
You want us to show up at a party
with a damn pineapple?

21:22.281 --> 21:23.866
Well, you didn't let me finish.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.035
I read this cool thing
where you take the pineapple

21:26.118 --> 21:28.037
and you soak it in rum overnight--

21:28.120 --> 21:29.246
Oh, shoot.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.624
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

21:31.707 --> 21:36.003
This is a particularly
naughty little device.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.214
Ta-da!

21:38.297 --> 21:40.382
-Is that a claw?
-Yes.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.135
-And a drainage hose?
<i>-Oui.</i>

21:43.219 --> 21:47.139
-And those are suction cups?
<i>-Oui, oui. </i>[giggles]

21:47.223 --> 21:50.559
Looks like Rube Goldberg
got naughty, am I right?

21:50.643 --> 21:56.565
It's held on to your special area
with a small machine washable belt.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.318
[giggles]
You walk around with it all day long.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.444
[whispering]
No one knows.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.531
-Mmm?
-Then, around midday,

22:03.614 --> 22:08.577
your hubby gives you
a little remote zippity-zap.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.497
[gasps, moans loudly]

22:11.580 --> 22:13.415
Ka-blow!

22:13.499 --> 22:16.126
You just clapped your monkey
in the middle of a business meeting.

22:16.210 --> 22:17.586
[giggles]

22:17.670 --> 22:19.255
Oh, I'm sorry, work superior,

22:19.338 --> 22:24.218
but my badass hubby
just made me kablookie in my pantsuit.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.554
Everyone knows
what I'm talking about, right?

22:26.637 --> 22:28.264
Wait. Are you--?
Wait, what? Are you listening?

22:28.346 --> 22:30.224
No, I'm just--
I'm texting Scott about the kids.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.308
Okay, okay.

22:31.392 --> 22:35.729
And the best part, it's only $175.

22:35.813 --> 22:36.814
Hmm...

22:36.897 --> 22:39.567
And it's made in America. Here, touch.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.318
Oh, no.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.904
You have my consent. Touch it.

22:43.988 --> 22:46.532
Here. Touch it, touch it. Touch it! -Okay. [clears throat]
-Wait, wait. You're not leaving, are you?

22:49.910 --> 22:51.537
No, no, I'm just-- I'm going to pee.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.622
Okay, because the products
are actually really good quality.

22:53.706 --> 22:54.874
Okay.

22:54.957 --> 22:57.918
Once it's locked onto the cervix,
that's when the fun really starts.

22:58.002 --> 23:00.671
It may take a few minutes,
but you just have to dig around.

23:00.754 --> 23:03.716
-Time out. Guys, Karen--
<i>-Je suis </i>Angelique.

23:03.799 --> 23:06.384
Fine. Paula's not having enough fun, okay?

23:06.468 --> 23:08.721
She's not blending seamlessly
into our group.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.849
We need to include her more
in our Friendtopia.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.726
Friendtatership?
No, I prefer Friendtopia.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.769
She just doesn't want
to be part of the group.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.062
You shouldn't, like, force it.

23:17.146 --> 23:20.065
I'm not forcing.
I'm aggressively facilitating.

23:20.149 --> 23:22.318
-She needs our help.
-[Paula] Help!

23:22.400 --> 23:23.485
Do you hear that?

23:23.569 --> 23:26.739
She is literally calling
for female group solidarity.

23:26.822 --> 23:29.158
-I will be right there.
-The lock is jammed! -I can't get out! I'm stuck! Help!
-Okay. Stand back.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.121
[British accent]
Girl group to the rescue! Zig-a-zow!

23:34.830 --> 23:36.165
Oh, geez.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.084
[whimpering]

23:39.168 --> 23:41.879

23:57.978 --> 24:00.189

25:42.666 --> 25:43.541
[sighs]

25:43.625 --> 25:45.836
So, I was thinking,
what about a weekend away, right?

25:45.919 --> 25:49.339
Like a bro surf weekend?
Whatever you guys are into.

25:49.423 --> 25:50.548
You guys roller skate?

25:52.342 --> 25:54.511
Psych. I know it's not cool.
[chuckles]

25:54.595 --> 25:56.430
I've grown out of it.
Look, blades though, right?

25:56.513 --> 26:00.434
And jackets with wings
because-- wait for it...

26:00.517 --> 26:03.854
we are the Chicken Wing Boys.

26:03.937 --> 26:04.772
Ca-caw!

26:04.855 --> 26:07.357
-Okay, I'm done.
-Yeah, I'm out too.

26:07.441 --> 26:10.319
But wait, you can't leave.
The game's not even in its last part.

26:10.402 --> 26:15.240
We'll just listen to it on the radio
in the car, or anywhere else. Come on.

26:15.324 --> 26:19.286
She called me "boo."
She called me "boo"! I'm so in!

26:19.369 --> 26:21.538
-Come on, boo!
-Ow!

26:21.622 --> 26:24.166
Thanks for all the free stuff, Tent--
I mean, uh, Rent.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.584
Uh... honestly, man,
it makes it harder.

26:27.878 --> 26:32.341
Wait, wait! Bros, stay, chill!

26:32.424 --> 26:34.927
My boos!

26:35.010 --> 26:37.679
[crowd cheers]

26:38.430 --> 26:42.184
Guys, I really need to sell something.
At least, buy some lube.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.519
It's great.

26:43.601 --> 26:46.814
I even use it as hand lotion,
which is why I'm always dropping things,

26:46.897 --> 26:48.816
and it's edible.

26:48.899 --> 26:51.777
[all groaning]

26:51.860 --> 26:53.070
[gags]

26:54.738 --> 26:56.990
Oh! Oh, God, Karen.

26:57.074 --> 26:59.159
You know what? I'm out of here.

26:59.243 --> 27:03.080
You guys are cheapskates
and you are not fun.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.207
<i>Au revoir, </i>losers.

27:06.959 --> 27:12.297
[doorknob rattling]

27:14.716 --> 27:16.760
Paula. Paula, I'm so sorry.

27:16.844 --> 27:20.472
I'm so sorry about the beam,
about Karen, everything.

27:20.556 --> 27:23.183
But the fire department
is on its way, okay? Um, if you get hungry, there's a Snickers
in that medicine cabinet.

27:25.978 --> 27:29.606
It's my bath Snickers, and I'll text Scott
and tell him what's happened.

27:29.690 --> 27:30.691
-Okay.
-Um...

27:30.774 --> 27:33.402
I don't have his number.
Uh, okay, I'll text him from your phone.

27:35.445 --> 27:39.491
No, you-- Hey, don't-- I'll just text him
when I get out of here, so...

27:39.575 --> 27:40.658
No, it's fine.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.495
No, no, no, no, no!
Hey, just don't worry about it!

27:43.579 --> 27:45.706
[stammering]
Just put my phone down!

27:45.789 --> 27:49.293
It feels like Paula is trying to hide
something from Rebecca

27:49.376 --> 27:50.627
that is on her phone.

27:50.711 --> 27:52.212
Is this part of what girls do?

27:52.296 --> 27:53.630
-Should I be giggling?
-No.

27:53.714 --> 27:56.633
I'm definitely gonna look
at your phone now, Paula.

27:56.717 --> 27:58.385
Luckily, I know your passcode.

27:58.468 --> 28:01.889
My God, I've got to change
my privacy settings. Just stop!

28:07.144 --> 28:10.397
Hey, ladies, do you want to know why Paula
didn't want me to look at her phone?

28:10.480 --> 28:13.275
This is actually really funny. Um...

28:13.358 --> 28:16.904
So, Paula texted her friend
from law school, Sunil,

28:16.987 --> 28:21.200
uh, quote, "Help! I'm having
the worst night of my life!" end quote.

28:21.283 --> 28:24.912
Okay, Rebecca, you put that phone down
because you are violating

28:24.995 --> 28:27.080
the 2012 California
Electronic Privacy Act!

28:27.164 --> 28:29.374
Oh, ba-ba-ba!
Sorry, there's actually-- There's more.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.044
This part's, like--
This is when it gets really funny.

28:32.127 --> 28:36.423
Um, she then says for him
to come rescue her,

28:36.506 --> 28:40.135
and then-- "Quick, make up some story
to get me the hell out of here."

28:42.221 --> 28:43.847
[laughing]

28:43.931 --> 28:45.474
-No.
-No? Hmm.

28:45.557 --> 28:48.393
Texts like these, like bitchy texts--
you used to send these to me.

28:51.188 --> 28:54.274
You know, Paula, I was agonizing

28:54.358 --> 28:56.860
over whether or not you'd felt
like I'd replaced you...

28:58.946 --> 29:02.407
but now, I realize
I'm the one who's been replaced.

29:04.117 --> 29:07.287
And, you know, you never
even gave this night a chance.

29:07.371 --> 29:08.455
You never even tried.

29:16.797 --> 29:21.301
Surf shop woman.
Super small world, the San Gabes Vals.

29:21.385 --> 29:24.263
Hey, yeah. How did your bro plan work out?

29:25.013 --> 29:26.807
It didn't. You were right.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.433
Forcing friendships is stupid.

29:28.517 --> 29:31.770
And now, the girl that I love
will never have a chance to love me back.

29:32.729 --> 29:36.358
Oh, my God! Oh!
You were doing this for a girl?

29:36.441 --> 29:39.027
Sweetie, why didn't you tell me that?

29:39.111 --> 29:41.280
[grunts]
That is so nice.

29:41.363 --> 29:42.489
[voice breaking]
I'm gonna cry.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.449
Really? You think it's sweet?

29:44.533 --> 29:47.077
Forcing friendships is weird,
but forcing love is so romantic.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.413
You've got to force love.
Everybody knows that.

29:49.496 --> 29:52.582
Look at Prince Charming.
He made a whole country try on a shoe.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.045
So, where is she? The girl that you love?

29:57.129 --> 29:59.464
I don't know. Probably at home.

29:59.548 --> 30:02.384
Then what are you doing here?
Go to her now! Run!

30:02.467 --> 30:04.177
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, go!

30:04.261 --> 30:07.431
-Okay. All right.
-Go get your Cinderella!

30:09.933 --> 30:15.022
So, you couldn't even tell me to my face
that you wanted to leave? Great.

30:15.689 --> 30:19.651
-[doorbell rings]
-Um, I'll get it.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.320
Oh, wonder who that is. Hmm?

30:21.403 --> 30:23.697
[grunts, sighs]

30:24.906 --> 30:28.368
Hi. Is Paula here?
I'm Sunil, Paula's friend.

30:28.452 --> 30:31.371
Paula, the dude you sent
those mean texts to about us is here.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.457
Yes! I have to tell her something.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.501
You won't believe what happened.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.837
I can barely catch my breath.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.966
I just came to tell Paula that Timmy--
Tommy stepped on a nail

30:43.050 --> 30:45.927
and has tetanus already
and has to be hospitalized.

30:47.220 --> 30:50.849
So, that wasn't even almost a good lie.

30:50.932 --> 30:55.020
Um, you sound like you're playing Pepper
in a road company of <i>Annie.</i>

30:55.103 --> 30:57.439
Excuse me, I have a degree in theater.

30:57.522 --> 31:01.985
If you did, you would know
that a road company, AKA national tour,

31:02.069 --> 31:04.654
is a very sought after engagement.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.823
Rebecca, I am so sorry.

31:06.907 --> 31:10.285
-Paula! What happened?
-Later!

31:10.369 --> 31:12.287
You know what?
Don't apologize to me, Paula.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.206
'Cause when the firemen get here
and get you out,

31:14.289 --> 31:15.874
you won't have to be
friends with me anymore.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.672
We could dress like caterers.

31:22.756 --> 31:26.093
No, and do you want me to give you a list
of the reasons why that's not gonna work?

31:27.135 --> 31:29.971
I can't do this anymore. I'm exhausted.

31:30.055 --> 31:34.101
Exhausted? We have a mission.
Show a little grit.

31:34.184 --> 31:37.687
What are you, a man or a mouse, huh?
Well, I know the answer to that.

31:37.771 --> 31:43.735
I see your little mouse paws.
"Oh, I'm nocturnal, but I'm still tired."

31:43.819 --> 31:46.780
Darryl, stop it. Okay?
I've had enough of you bullying me.

31:46.863 --> 31:51.410
You've done it ever since I got here.
I'm nice, I work hard, and I'm smart.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.371
The fact that my boss picks on me
is making me worse at my job

31:54.454 --> 31:55.997
and negatively impacting my health.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.332
[coughs]

31:57.416 --> 31:59.960
You've created a hostile work environment.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.672
Oh, I mean, I was just teasing.

32:03.755 --> 32:08.718
No, you weren't. You don't like me
and I want to know why.

32:10.262 --> 32:14.391
Well, I don't know. I don't know.

32:14.474 --> 32:15.475
Yes, I do know.

32:15.559 --> 32:18.854
Because you remind me of somebody
I'm very uncomfortable with.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.689
Me, myself, and I.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.066
Really?

32:23.150 --> 32:25.444
You're overeager,
desperate to be included,

32:25.527 --> 32:28.447
forcing yourself on people,
and I don't like that about myself.

32:28.530 --> 32:31.616
And when I see it on someone else,
I find it even more repulsive.

32:31.700 --> 32:35.829
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:35.912 --> 32:39.749
Look, it's not your fault, I swear.

32:39.833 --> 32:42.419
Whatever your next idea is,
that's what we're gonna do.

32:42.502 --> 32:45.213
Do you mean it?
'Cause this one's really good.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.884
[grunting]

32:49.885 --> 32:55.348
Sorry. I haven't worked out since birth,
so this isn't gonna work.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.476
Somebody get me out of here.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.019
-Maybe if we all work together.
-[Sunil] Yeah.

32:59.102 --> 33:02.731
Oh! So, now, you want everyone
to be together and do together things?

33:02.814 --> 33:04.524
-[chuckles sarcastically]
-[knocking on door]

33:04.608 --> 33:08.153
Well, the firemen are here, Paula,
so your wish is granted. You can leave.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.114
Trent?

33:11.198 --> 33:13.408
-[romantic music playing]
-Rebecca, I'm here.

33:13.492 --> 33:17.078
I am here to tell you
how I feel about you...

33:18.163 --> 33:19.706
and I'm not gonna wait another minute.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.417
Trent, you weirdo face, put me down!

33:22.501 --> 33:26.254
You just scooped me up like I was
a basket of muffins, but put me down!

33:26.338 --> 33:29.466
-What are you doing here?
-I'm here to make you try on a shoe.

33:29.549 --> 33:30.592
[romantic music stops]

33:30.675 --> 33:32.344
Dude, what?

33:32.427 --> 33:35.013
Keep talking, guys.
Still stuck in the bathroom.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.641
-Oh, God.
-Wait, what's the problem?

33:37.724 --> 33:39.059
Well, Paula's stuck in there,

33:39.142 --> 33:42.187
and we've been waiting for the fireman
for, like, a long time.

33:42.270 --> 33:45.857
-Typical girl group stuff, right?
-No.

33:45.941 --> 33:50.028
There's no need for a fireman.
Step aside, ladies.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.530
We're not in your way.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.618
-You've just got to force it.
-Whoa.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.495
[grunting] -Here, here, here, here!
-Oh, oh.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.628
I got you, I got you.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.171
[grunting]

34:08.797 --> 34:12.175
See, you can force construction stuff
but not, like, friend stuff.

34:14.678 --> 34:17.389
Wow. Okay, so Trent's here.
Why is Trent here? You know what?

34:17.472 --> 34:20.725
Don't tell me. Just whatever nonsense
is going on between the two of you now,

34:20.809 --> 34:22.644
I just-- I don't want to know.
Come on, Sunil.

34:22.727 --> 34:26.273
Yes, we have to go get Tommy
before he's killed with tetanus.

34:26.356 --> 34:31.069
No, no, no, you are not leaving.
We need to talk.

34:32.445 --> 34:36.366
You have been rude to me
and everybody here this whole night.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.786
And it really makes me angry
because I did this all for you.

34:39.869 --> 34:42.455
You did all this for me?

34:42.539 --> 34:44.958
I sensed that you were feeling
left out of my friend group

34:45.041 --> 34:46.501
and so I wanted to include you.

34:46.585 --> 34:50.755
No, uh, you just wanted to feel better
about abandoning our friendship.

34:50.839 --> 34:55.844
You moved on from us, as friends,
which is fine, but just admit it.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.305
[chuckles]
So, I moved on from you?

34:58.388 --> 35:00.724
What's going on
with, uh, your palsy-walsiness

35:00.807 --> 35:02.267
with daughter number five
from <i>Fiddler</i>?

35:02.350 --> 35:05.979
She has a name. It's Bielke.
She's a principal character.

35:06.062 --> 35:08.607
Why is he always talking
about his theater major?

35:08.690 --> 35:10.650
-Because--
-I know many theater majors!

35:10.734 --> 35:13.695
They don't bring it up! They just are!

35:13.778 --> 35:16.990
Also, you want
to talk <i>Fiddler </i>sisters, bro?

35:17.073 --> 35:21.494
We got Tzeitel, Hodel, Chava, Shprintze,
and I'm not a theater major.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.455
I've just seen the show a couple times.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.832
-No one cares!
-He does.

35:25.915 --> 35:29.419
Hey, Rebecca, for the past few months,

35:29.502 --> 35:32.505
every time I wanted to talk to you,
you were too busy for me.

35:32.589 --> 35:35.800
Uh-uh, no, that's not true.
That's not true. That's not true.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.720
I spent hours on that letter
of recommendation for you.

35:38.803 --> 35:43.266
Yes, and when did you give it to me?
When did you put it in my hand?

35:43.350 --> 35:45.060
After the deadline.

35:46.436 --> 35:49.731
But... [stammering]
You said it was really good.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.441
That's like saying,
"Birthday cake is better the next day."

35:51.524 --> 35:53.443
Which it famously is!

35:53.526 --> 35:56.321
Admit it. Our relationship
has always been one-sided.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.615
I give, you take,
and that is how it works.

35:58.698 --> 36:02.118
That's not fair. That's not fair.
That hurts me.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.746
You've never been there for me
when I need you.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.791
Yes, I have been. Just the other day,
I came to your house,

36:07.874 --> 36:09.793
when you were sick with the flu,
or whatever.

36:09.876 --> 36:13.046
-You didn't tell me what it was.
-The flu? I had an abortion.

36:15.548 --> 36:16.925
[inhales sharply]

36:17.008 --> 36:19.177
-[exhales]
-Oh, my God.

36:21.054 --> 36:22.138
You had an abortion?

36:22.222 --> 36:24.974
Yes. Yes, I did.

36:25.058 --> 36:27.185
-You didn't tell me?
-No, I did not.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.687
She wanted to tell you many times--

36:28.770 --> 36:32.107
So, Kenickie's understudy there knows?
You told him?

36:32.190 --> 36:35.443
-Okay.
-You've known him for, like, three days!

36:35.527 --> 36:37.779
Yeah, you know what?
And he listens to me.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.616
I listen to you.
I would've listened to you.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.827
You just didn't give me the chance.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.704
I was-- I was sitting there.

36:45.787 --> 36:50.166
I was sitting there
on the edge of your bed...

36:50.250 --> 36:51.918
and you said nothing.

36:52.001 --> 36:55.797
I mean, I asked you. I asked you
point blank if anything was wrong.

36:55.880 --> 36:56.923
You didn't really mean it.

36:57.006 --> 36:59.092
-Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
-No, you didn't.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.886
This is the problem. You never give me
the chance. You never give me the chance.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.763
You never ask for my support
with your abortion,

37:03.847 --> 37:05.140
or anything else in your life.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.725
I shouldn't have to ask!

37:08.643 --> 37:11.229
-[siren wails]
-The firemen are here.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.523
-The emergency's over.
-[Darryl] Is it?

37:13.606 --> 37:16.943
I think the dance emergency
has just begun!

37:17.026 --> 37:18.820
[hip hop song playing on stereo]

37:38.923 --> 37:39.841
[song ends]

37:43.011 --> 37:46.097
Do firemen just not come to this house?

37:46.181 --> 37:49.851
Who? What about that dance?
That was pretty awesome, right?

37:49.934 --> 37:52.604
It's so super easy to learn. You'll see.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.190
Okay. Now, Maya and I--
we're gonna split you into two groups,

37:55.273 --> 37:58.193
so everybody count off,
"one-two, one-two, one-two."

38:00.820 --> 38:02.405
What, no takers?

38:03.490 --> 38:04.783
Hey...

38:04.866 --> 38:08.036
Isn't this the house where
all those drug dealers were murdered?

38:08.119 --> 38:10.371
Marble countertops! Cool!

38:13.374 --> 38:15.126
What were you guys talking about?

38:15.210 --> 38:16.628
[chuckles]

38:21.674 --> 38:23.468
-[knocking on door]
-Come in.

38:25.178 --> 38:31.476
Hey. I just wanted to say good-bye.
I'm leaving and I'm sorry.

38:31.559 --> 38:32.727
I tried to force things.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.187
First friendship, and then love,

38:34.270 --> 38:37.315
and now, I know
that forcing things doesn't work.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.818
Yeah, I feel that.

38:39.901 --> 38:41.444
And now, I know that, apparently,

38:41.528 --> 38:43.655
horrifying things have
happened in this house

38:43.738 --> 38:45.198
and I had no idea.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.699
[sighs]

38:46.783 --> 38:49.702
Listen, Trent, I appreciate you
Schwarzenegger-ing out back there.

38:49.786 --> 38:52.497
But what are you doing here?
I haven't seen you in months.

38:52.580 --> 38:56.209
Well, I found out that you broke up
with Greg and Josh,

38:56.292 --> 38:59.462
and so you were finally a free agent.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.423
I hacked your texts and your e-mails.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.801
Oh. Wow. Okay.

39:04.884 --> 39:08.263
Yeah, I'm sorry about that, too.
Um, good-bye.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.014
Wait.

39:11.474 --> 39:14.894
-Are you clean?
-Yeah, I spot washed this morning.

39:14.978 --> 39:18.690
What? No, I meant, do you have
any diseases? Like, the big ones?

39:18.773 --> 39:21.693
No, I just got a physical.
My body is perfect.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.611
Great. Wanna have sex?

39:23.695 --> 39:26.322
Are you kidding?

39:26.406 --> 39:28.741
Well, I mean, I'm bored,
I got nothing to do,

39:28.825 --> 39:31.369
and plus, it might cheer me up, so...

39:32.871 --> 39:34.247
Are you in?

39:34.330 --> 39:37.041
-Yes, please.
-Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

39:37.125 --> 39:41.880
Just to be clear though,
I don't want to see you again after this.

39:41.963 --> 39:45.091
-Understood?
-Understood.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.635
Okay, what?
[squeals]

39:47.719 --> 39:50.430
-Can I kiss your mouth?
-Yes. Mm.

39:50.513 --> 39:53.683
So, can you show us in person?
'Cause I watched online, like, 50 times,

39:53.766 --> 39:57.145
and I just-- I keep messing it up,
and everyone's doing it at every party.

39:57.228 --> 40:01.149
Oh, yeah.
That's how you get to 1,800 views!

40:01.232 --> 40:05.528
-So many. So, does it have a name?
-Oh, yeah, it's got a name.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.363
It's, uh...

40:07.447 --> 40:08.573
It's called "The Maya."

40:09.949 --> 40:11.200
Hit it, M-Dog.

40:12.118 --> 40:13.494
[stereo clicks]

40:14.370 --> 40:17.290
-Five, six, seven, eight.
-[hip hop music playing]

40:36.643 --> 40:39.145
[music continuing faintly]

40:58.122 --> 41:00.416
[gasps]
Wow!

41:00.500 --> 41:03.336
Trent, I gotta say, um...

41:03.419 --> 41:04.587
that was amazing.

41:04.671 --> 41:05.880
You're, um...

41:05.964 --> 41:10.093
You're really good at...
at everything, actually.

41:10.176 --> 41:14.889
I mean, you're just so patient.
Thank you.

41:16.015 --> 41:19.352
No, it is I who should thank you...

41:19.435 --> 41:21.479
for taking my virginity.

41:24.232 --> 41:26.943
No, no, I... No, no, I didn't.

41:27.026 --> 41:28.277
Yes, you did.

41:28.361 --> 41:29.988
Do you want to take it again?

41:32.907 --> 41:34.450
Eh, okay.

41:34.534 --> 41:37.912
No, no, no, no.
You gotta pay the toll first, buddy.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.497
Come on, there we go.
