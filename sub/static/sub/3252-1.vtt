Coming through.

00:33.980 --> 00:35.900
Madame Vastra, thank God.

00:36.860 --> 00:39.620
I'll wager you've not seen anything
like this before. Well...

00:41.940 --> 00:45.130
..not since I was a little girl.
Big fella, isn't he?

00:45.180 --> 00:50.370
Dinosaurs were mostly this size.
I do believe it's a "she".

00:50.420 --> 00:54.130
No, they weren't, I've seen fossils.
I was there.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.650
Well, that's all well and good,

00:55.700 --> 00:58.650
but what's this dinosaur fellow
doing in the Thames?

01:00.420 --> 01:02.500

- Jenny?

01:05.820 --> 01:07.020
Time travelled?

01:09.180 --> 01:11.450
DINOSAUR RETCHES
Is it choking?

01:11.500 --> 01:13.810
There seems to be something
lodged in its throat.

01:13.860 --> 01:16.930
- How could it time travel?
- I don't know.

01:16.980 --> 01:18.740
Perhaps it was something it ate.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.300
Stand back. Stand back, stand back.

01:34.980 --> 01:36.810
Well, it's just laid an egg.

01:36.860 --> 01:40.850
It's dropped a blue box marked
"Police" out of its mouth.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.580
Your grasp of biology troubles me.

01:45.820 --> 01:47.210
It's the TARDIS.

01:47.260 --> 01:48.810
It would seem so.

01:48.860 --> 01:50.890
We'll take care of this, Inspector.

01:50.940 --> 01:53.770
But what if that thing
goes on the rampage?

01:53.820 --> 01:56.890
Place these lanterns on
the shoreline and bridges,

01:56.940 --> 02:00.730
encircling the creature
at 20-foot intervals.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.170
What will they do?

02:02.220 --> 02:05.490
They will emit a signal
that will incline it to remain

02:05.540 --> 02:07.330
within their circumference.

02:07.380 --> 02:09.220
Jenny, Strax...

02:10.660 --> 02:12.100
..with me.

02:13.980 --> 02:16.010
So it's him, then, the Doctor?

02:16.060 --> 02:20.210
A giant dinosaur from the distant
past has just vomited a blue box

02:20.260 --> 02:24.890
from outer space - this is not a day
for jumping to conclusions.

02:24.940 --> 02:26.860
Strax, if you wouldn't mind?

02:35.900 --> 02:41.540
Hello? Exit the box, and surrender
to the glory of the Sontaran empire.

02:42.740 --> 02:43.940
Shush!

02:45.620 --> 02:47.300
Doctor?

02:48.820 --> 02:50.410
I was being chased
by a giant dinosaur,

02:50.460 --> 02:52.540
but I think I managed
to give it the slip.

03:08.060 --> 03:09.050
Sleepy?

03:09.100 --> 03:10.460
Sir?

03:12.820 --> 03:15.460
Bashful? Sneezy? Dopey?

03:17.900 --> 03:18.940
Grumpy!

03:22.300 --> 03:24.020
Oh, you two!

03:25.340 --> 03:29.090
The green one...
and the not-green one.

03:29.140 --> 03:32.210
Or it could be the other way round,
I mustn't prejudge!

03:32.260 --> 03:33.980
Oh, you remember, er...

03:40.100 --> 03:45.410
..thingy, the, er, the not-me one,
the asking-questions one?

03:45.460 --> 03:47.860
Names - not my area.

03:48.940 --> 03:52.770
Clara! Well, it might be Clara,
might not be - it's a lottery.

03:52.820 --> 03:54.570
It is Clara.
Well, I'm not ruling it out!

03:59.020 --> 04:01.660

04:04.340 --> 04:05.930
Big woman, sorry.

04:05.980 --> 04:09.530
Doctor, listen to me.
You...you need to calm down.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.890
I'm not flirting, by the way.

04:11.940 --> 04:13.940
I think something's gone wrong.

04:15.620 --> 04:20.620
Wrong? What's gone wrong?
Have you regenerated?

04:22.220 --> 04:23.260
I remember you.

04:24.940 --> 04:26.130
You're Handles!

04:26.180 --> 04:30.580
You used to be a little...
a little robot head, and now you...

04:32.060 --> 04:33.620
..you've really let yourself go.

I'm sorry? Your sonic lanterns,
turn them down.

04:45.580 --> 04:48.010
You're giving her a headache.
Giving who a headache?

04:48.060 --> 04:51.330
My lady friend!

04:51.380 --> 04:54.130
Just an expression, don't get
any ideas. How do you know?

04:54.180 --> 04:56.930
Come on, Clara!
You know that I speak dinosaur.

04:56.980 --> 04:58.580
He's not Clara. I'm Clara.

05:00.460 --> 05:04.660
Well, you're very similar heights.
Maybe you should wear labels.

05:08.420 --> 05:11.850
Why...why are you all doing that?
Why are you...

05:11.900 --> 05:14.620
You're all going dark...

05:16.340 --> 05:17.730
..and wobbly - stop that.

05:17.780 --> 05:19.610
I don't think we are.

05:19.660 --> 05:23.500
Never mind! Everyone...take five.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.410
What do we do?

05:32.460 --> 05:36.330
I don't understand,
who is he? Where's the Doctor?

05:36.380 --> 05:37.420
Right here.

05:39.140 --> 05:40.180
That's him.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.180
That's the Doctor.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.140
Well then, here we go again.

06:33.780 --> 06:34.820
DINOSAUR ROARS

06:37.660 --> 06:41.810
It's simply misunderstandable
to me. I don't know what it is.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.770
Who invented this room?

06:43.820 --> 06:46.970
Doctor, please, you have to lie down.

06:47.020 --> 06:50.130
It doesn't make sense.
Look, it's only got a bed in it.

06:50.180 --> 06:52.170
Why is there only a bed in it?

06:52.220 --> 06:55.100
Because it's a bed-ROOM,
it's for sleeping in.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.170
OK, what do you do
when you're awake?

06:59.220 --> 07:00.340
You leave the room.

07:01.580 --> 07:04.330
So you've got a whole room
for not being awake in?

07:04.380 --> 07:07.010
But what's the point?
You're just missing the room!

07:07.060 --> 07:09.730
And don't look in that mirror -
it's absolutely furious.

07:09.780 --> 07:13.890
Doctor, please, you have to lie down,
you keep passing out.

07:13.940 --> 07:16.570
Well, of course I keep passing out,
there's all these beds!

07:16.620 --> 07:18.650
Why do you keep talking like that?

07:18.700 --> 07:20.890
What's gone wrong with your accent?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.890
Nothing's wrong with her accent.

07:22.940 --> 07:25.010
You sound the same. It's spreading.

07:25.060 --> 07:27.610
You all sound all...English.

07:27.660 --> 07:30.610
Now you've all developed a fault!

07:30.660 --> 07:34.330
SCOTTISH ACCENT: Doctor,
I need your help with something.

07:34.380 --> 07:37.140
Finally, someone
who can talk properly.

07:38.340 --> 07:40.930
I'm having difficulty sleeping. Oh?

07:40.980 --> 07:44.250
Oh, well, I wouldn't bother with
that, I never bother with sleep,

07:44.300 --> 07:47.970
and I just do standy-up-catnaps.
Oh, really, how interesting.

07:48.020 --> 07:49.650
And when do you do those?

07:49.700 --> 07:52.050
Well, generally whenever
anyone else starts talking.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.450
I like to skip ahead to my bits,
it saves time.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.370
Save me time, Doctor.

07:56.420 --> 08:02.130
Project an image of perfect sleep
into the centre of my mind.

08:02.180 --> 08:04.730
What, do you want
a psychic link with me?

08:04.780 --> 08:07.060
The size of my brain, it would
be like dropping a piano on you.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.210
Be gentle, then.

08:10.260 --> 08:12.580
I'll try. Brace yourself!

08:13.820 --> 08:14.860
Piano.

08:16.460 --> 08:17.970
THWACK!

08:18.020 --> 08:20.330
ENGLISH ACCENT: I love monkeys,
they're so funny.

08:20.380 --> 08:24.970
Oh, I see! So people are monkeys
now, are they? No, dear.

08:25.020 --> 08:27.050
People are apes.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.770
Men are monkeys.

08:29.820 --> 08:32.690
So what now? He needs rest.

08:32.740 --> 08:34.210
So what do we do? How do we fix him?

08:34.260 --> 08:35.900
Fix him? How do we change him back?

08:38.700 --> 08:41.730
Jenny...I will be in my chamber.

08:41.780 --> 08:44.010
Would you be kind enough
to fetch my veil?

08:44.059 --> 08:46.610
Why, are we expecting strangers?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.970
It would seem...

08:49.020 --> 08:50.700
there's already one here.

08:56.660 --> 08:57.850
What have I done wrong?

09:00.620 --> 09:03.450
The dinosaur doesn't seem
very happy.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.090
What's wrong with it?

09:05.140 --> 09:08.500
I dunno. The Doctor's
the one that speaks dinosaur.

09:12.020 --> 09:15.900
Excuse me, ma'am, the wife
doesn't like to be kept waiting.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.260
Where did he get that face?

09:20.380 --> 09:23.290
Why's it got lines on it?
It's brand-new.

09:23.340 --> 09:26.340
How can his hair be all grey?
He only just got it.

09:27.420 --> 09:30.620
It's still him, ma'am,
you saw him change.

09:32.140 --> 09:34.930
I know. I do, I...
I know that. Good.

09:34.980 --> 09:36.410
It's just... What?

09:36.460 --> 09:37.900
Nothing.

09:39.540 --> 09:44.250
If... If Vastra changed,
if she was different,

09:44.300 --> 09:47.780
if she wasn't the person
that you liked...

09:49.980 --> 09:51.930
I don't like her, ma'am,

09:51.980 --> 09:53.460
I love her.

09:54.900 --> 09:58.740
And as to different, well,
she's a lizard.

10:36.420 --> 10:38.100
and the trees...

10:39.620 --> 10:43.820
..and the sky, have gone...

10:46.020 --> 10:48.340
..and I am alone now...

10:49.740 --> 10:51.650
..alone.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.970
Are you translating?

10:54.020 --> 10:56.060
The wind bites now...

10:57.940 --> 10:59.980
..and the world is grey...

11:02.300 --> 11:04.260
..and I am alone here.

11:06.380 --> 11:07.460
Can't see me.

11:09.020 --> 11:10.460
Doesn't see me.

11:12.180 --> 11:14.730
Can't...see me.

11:14.780 --> 11:17.620
Who can't see it? I think
all of London can see it.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.820
Boy? Madame Vastra is waiting.

11:23.740 --> 11:25.410
OK, whatever.

11:25.460 --> 11:29.540
I will convey you to her chamber.
May I take your coat?

11:31.060 --> 11:32.570
Not wearing a coat.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.970
What's all that? Clothes.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.010
May I take your clothes?

11:37.060 --> 11:38.610
(Probably not.)

11:38.660 --> 11:40.650
Are you wearing a hat? It's hair.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.050
No, I think it's a hat,
would you like me to check?

What is it, then?

The government. The government?

11:58.100 --> 12:00.370
Yeah, up to their usual tricks.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.450
It's a dinosaur, Alf.
A real dinosaur.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.250
I wouldn't put it past them.

12:05.300 --> 12:08.050
You don't half talk
a lot of rubbish, Alfie.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.850
See you don't stay out too late now.

Just don't look realistic.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.930
You have good eyes.

12:29.980 --> 12:32.810
Oh, I do, as it happens,
very good eyes.

12:32.860 --> 12:34.300
They're my greatest gift.

12:35.780 --> 12:36.930
I accept.

12:36.980 --> 12:38.020
What's that for?

12:39.460 --> 12:40.850
Your gift.

12:40.900 --> 12:43.490
I have bad eyes.
HE SCREAMS

12:43.540 --> 12:45.580
And then?

12:47.540 --> 12:50.690
Why are you wearing your veil?
And then?

12:50.740 --> 12:55.850
And then we got swallowed by a big
dinosaur. You probably noticed.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.690
How did it happen?

12:57.740 --> 13:02.770
I don't know, I don't know,
we were...crashing about everywhere.

13:02.820 --> 13:05.010
The Doctor was gone,
the TARDIS went haywire.

13:05.060 --> 13:07.780
He's not gone. He's upstairs.

13:10.980 --> 13:12.890
OK, he changed.

13:12.940 --> 13:15.250
He regenerated, renewed himself.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.500
Renewed, fine.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.180
Such a cynical smile.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.130
I'm not smiling.

13:23.180 --> 13:27.690
Not outwardly, but I'm accustomed
to seeing through a veil.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.770
How have I amused you?

13:29.820 --> 13:31.780
You said renewed. He doesn't...

13:33.340 --> 13:36.210
He doesn't look renewed,
he looks...older.

13:36.260 --> 13:38.250
You thought he was young?

13:38.300 --> 13:40.050
He looked young.

13:40.100 --> 13:44.210
He looked like your dashing young
gentleman friend, your lover, even.

13:44.260 --> 13:45.410
Shut up!

13:45.460 --> 13:47.250
But he is the Doctor.

13:47.300 --> 13:50.690
He has walked this universe
for centuries untold,

13:50.740 --> 13:53.330
he has seen stars fall to dust.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.770
You might as well flirt
with a mountain range.

13:55.820 --> 13:57.650
I did not flirt with him.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.180
He flirted with you.

14:00.820 --> 14:04.860
How? He looked young.
Who do you think that was for?

14:07.060 --> 14:08.050
Me?

14:08.100 --> 14:10.250
Everyone.

14:10.300 --> 14:14.210
I wear a veil as he wore a face -
for the same reason.

14:14.260 --> 14:15.850
What reason?

14:15.900 --> 14:18.650
The oldest reason
there is for anything...

14:18.700 --> 14:20.660
to be accepted.

14:22.780 --> 14:24.820
HE SNIFFS

14:27.660 --> 14:29.700
HE SNIFFS INTENSELY

14:43.060 --> 14:45.100
HE CONTINUES TO SNIFF

14:49.300 --> 14:51.340
HE RUMMAGES

14:53.980 --> 14:56.020
HE SNIFFS DEEPLY

14:59.700 --> 15:03.810
Jenny and I are married,
yet for appearance's sake,

15:03.860 --> 15:07.970
we maintain a pretence, in public,
that she is my maid.

15:08.020 --> 15:11.610
Doesn't exactly explain
why I'm pouring tea in private.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.570
Hush now.
Good pretence, isn't it?

15:14.620 --> 15:16.930
I wear a veil to keep from view

15:16.980 --> 15:20.020
what many are pleased
to call my disfigurement.

15:21.580 --> 15:24.530
I do not wear it as a courtesy
to such people,

15:24.580 --> 15:28.940
but as a judgment on the quality
of their hearts.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.700
Are you judging me?

15:33.540 --> 15:36.450
The Doctor regenerated
in your presence.

15:36.500 --> 15:41.770
The young man disappeared,
the veil lifted. He trusted you.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.530
Are you judging him?

15:43.580 --> 15:45.620
SHE GASPS

15:51.700 --> 15:53.850
How dare you?

15:53.900 --> 15:55.540
How dare you?

15:59.700 --> 16:00.740
DINOSAUR MURMURS

16:13.020 --> 16:15.700
Door. Boring. Not me.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.250
Me!

16:23.300 --> 16:24.970
Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor,

16:25.020 --> 16:27.090
last of the five good'uns,
stoic philosopher.

16:27.140 --> 16:30.050
Superlative bass guitarist -
the Doctor really knows how to put

16:30.100 --> 16:32.970
a band together. And the only pin-up
I ever had on my wall when I was 15,

16:33.020 --> 16:34.010
the only one I ever had.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.930
I am not sure who you think you're
talking to right now, Madam Vastra,

16:36.980 --> 16:39.650
but I have never had the slightest
interest in pretty young men.

16:39.700 --> 16:42.210
And for the record, if there ever was
anybody who could flirt

16:42.260 --> 16:45.490
with a mountain range, she's probably
standing in front of you right now!

16:45.540 --> 16:47.930
Just because my pretty face
has turned your head,

16:47.980 --> 16:50.380
do not assume that I am
so easily distracted.

16:52.060 --> 16:53.890
Whoo!

16:53.940 --> 16:54.980
Woo-hoo!

16:58.060 --> 16:59.100
Sorry!

17:00.540 --> 17:02.570
Well...
SHE CHUCKLES

17:02.620 --> 17:03.850
..goodness me!

17:03.900 --> 17:05.170
The lake is ruffled at last.

17:05.220 --> 17:08.050
I often wondered what you'd
be like when you lost your temper.

17:08.099 --> 17:09.170
Oi!
SHE HISSES

17:09.220 --> 17:10.260
Married.

17:13.260 --> 17:15.930
The Doctor needs us,
you more than anyone.

17:15.980 --> 17:19.460
He is lost in the ruin of himself,
and we must bring him home.

17:23.740 --> 17:25.380
When did you stop wearing your veil?

17:27.420 --> 17:29.140
When you stopped seeing it.

17:31.540 --> 17:35.090
Oi! Oi!

17:35.140 --> 17:38.850
Oi, big, sexy woman!

17:38.900 --> 17:39.940
Oi!

17:42.180 --> 17:45.210
Sorry. Sorry, it's all my fault.

17:45.260 --> 17:48.290
My time machine got stuck
in your throat. It happens.

17:48.340 --> 17:51.250
I brought you along by accident,
that's mostly how I meet girls,

17:51.300 --> 17:55.610
but don't worry,
I promise I will get you home.

17:55.660 --> 17:58.250
DINOSAUR ROARS
I swear, whatever it takes,

17:58.300 --> 18:02.690
I will keep you safe.

18:02.740 --> 18:07.020
You will be at home again.

18:08.260 --> 18:09.900
DINOSAUR ROARS FEROCIOUSLY

18:14.980 --> 18:16.130
Stop that.

18:16.180 --> 18:19.380
- Who's doing that?
- No, don't do that.

18:20.420 --> 18:21.930
That came from the river!

18:21.980 --> 18:23.730
The dinosaur!

18:23.780 --> 18:26.060
Strax, bring the carriage, now!

18:29.420 --> 18:30.460
Arrggh!

18:32.260 --> 18:33.730
BRANCH CREAKS

18:33.780 --> 18:35.290
Arrggh! Arrggh!

18:35.340 --> 18:36.730
Arrggh!

18:36.780 --> 18:38.220
Oh!

18:41.580 --> 18:42.770
Halt!

18:42.820 --> 18:46.290
Sorry, I'm going to have
to relieve you of your pet!

18:46.340 --> 18:47.570
You're what?

18:47.620 --> 18:49.130
Shut up, I was talking to the horse!

18:49.180 --> 18:50.450
HORSE WHINNIES

18:50.500 --> 18:51.660
HE GROAN

18:55.820 --> 18:57.660
- What are you doing? 
- Forwards!

19:02.020 --> 19:03.580
Out of the way, human scum! Hyya!

19:05.540 --> 19:06.660
Jurassic emergency!

19:08.460 --> 19:09.500
Hyya!

19:14.660 --> 19:16.450
HORSE WHINNIES

19:16.500 --> 19:17.490
Left!

19:17.540 --> 19:21.010
No, no! Right, right, right, right!

19:21.060 --> 19:23.700
Sorry, it's my new hands,
I can't tell them apart.

19:31.180 --> 19:32.690
What do you think's happened?

19:32.740 --> 19:34.690
I don't know, but I fear devilment.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.250
Should we not have told the Doctor?

19:37.300 --> 19:39.140
He's not ready to leave his bed.

19:41.540 --> 19:44.060
Watch it on the corners,
it's a bit slippery up here!

19:45.140 --> 19:47.570
Strax! Hyya! Come on, Strax! Hyya!

19:47.620 --> 19:50.020
Hyya, hyya! That's better!

19:56.860 --> 19:58.570
(Sorry, sorry.)

19:58.620 --> 20:00.380
(I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.)

20:02.420 --> 20:03.700
Whoa.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.170
The Doctor! What's he doing here?

20:12.220 --> 20:14.370
CAR ALARM CHIRPS

20:14.420 --> 20:16.770
There is trouble -
where else would he be?

20:16.820 --> 20:18.700
She was scared.

20:19.980 --> 20:21.420
She was scared and alone.

20:23.780 --> 20:25.740
I brought her here
and look what they did.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.460
Who or what could have done
this thing?

20:32.780 --> 20:34.090
No.

20:34.140 --> 20:36.090
I'm sorry?

20:36.140 --> 20:43.130
No. That is not the question,
that is not where we start.

20:43.180 --> 20:44.530
The question is how.

20:44.580 --> 20:47.210
The flesh itself
has been combusted...

20:47.260 --> 20:49.330
No, no, shut up!

20:49.380 --> 20:52.130
What do you all have for brains -
pudding?

20:52.180 --> 20:53.220
Look at you.

20:55.100 --> 20:59.490
Why can't I meet a decent species?
Planet of the pudding-brains!

20:59.540 --> 21:00.580
Doctor...

21:02.100 --> 21:06.090
..I know you're upset, but you need
to calm down and talk to us.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.370
What is the question?

21:07.420 --> 21:11.490
A dinosaur is burning
in the heart of London.

21:11.540 --> 21:13.860
Nothing left but smoke and flame.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.100
The question is...

21:20.060 --> 21:21.900
..have there been
any similar murders?

21:25.460 --> 21:28.380
Yes! Yes, by the Goddess,
there have!

21:30.100 --> 21:31.740
Look at them all - gawking!

21:33.260 --> 21:34.300
CROWD MURMURS

21:37.100 --> 21:38.420
Question two.

21:40.180 --> 21:42.140
If all the pudding-brains
are gawking...

21:43.420 --> 21:44.900
..then what is he?

21:49.540 --> 21:53.330
He seems remarkably unmoved
by the available spectacle.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.450
Do you think that's whoever...?

21:55.500 --> 21:56.660
HEAVY SPLASH

21:57.820 --> 22:00.890
What he's doing? He'll drown!
I very much doubt it.

22:00.940 --> 22:03.890
Why? There has been a murder.

22:03.940 --> 22:06.570
The Doctor has taken up the case.

22:06.620 --> 22:09.060
If we are to see him again,
we must do the same.

22:22.700 --> 22:27.410
Come on, Earthling scum!
Position it here. Easy now!

22:27.460 --> 22:29.210
That's it. Careful.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.450
Don't get it scratched
or you and all your bloodline

22:31.500 --> 22:33.890
will be obliterated from time
and space. Very good, sir.

22:33.940 --> 22:35.650
Strax!

22:35.700 --> 22:39.410
Ah, morning, Miss Clara.
You're awake at last.

22:39.460 --> 22:40.930
You got the TARDIS, then?

22:40.980 --> 22:43.850
Military tactics.
The Doctor is still missing,

22:43.900 --> 22:46.570
but he will always come
looking for his box.

22:46.620 --> 22:49.250
By bringing it here,
he will be lured from the dangers

22:49.300 --> 22:50.810
of London to this place of safety,

22:50.860 --> 22:53.530
and we will melt him with acid.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.970
OK, that last part?

22:55.020 --> 23:01.380
And we will not melt him with acid.
Old habits.

23:02.500 --> 23:05.180
The Times. Shall I send it up?
Yeah, why not?

23:06.380 --> 23:07.780
Hyya!

23:19.900 --> 23:22.730
Jenny! Ah, good morning, Clara.
Morning.

23:22.780 --> 23:26.290
Erm, so what are we going to do?
Are we looking for the Doctor?

23:26.340 --> 23:28.570
We've got the Paternoster Irregulars
out in force.

23:28.620 --> 23:31.490
If anyone can find him, they can.

23:31.540 --> 23:34.850
Meanwhile, Madam Vastra
is slightly occupied

23:34.900 --> 23:36.970
by the Conk-Singleton forgery case.

23:37.020 --> 23:40.130
and is having the Camberwell
child-poisoner for dinner...

23:40.180 --> 23:41.170
For dinner?

23:41.220 --> 23:44.210
..after she's finished
interrogating him.

23:44.260 --> 23:46.770
Probably best to stay out
the larder.

23:46.820 --> 23:49.090
It'll get a bit noisy
in there later.

23:49.140 --> 23:50.180
Erm...

23:59.900 --> 24:01.740
Ah, Miss Clara!

24:03.060 --> 24:05.090
You look better now you're up.

24:05.140 --> 24:06.570
Thank you, Strax!

24:06.620 --> 24:10.010
Oh, sorry, trick of the light.
You still look terrible.

24:10.060 --> 24:11.730
Can I get you anything?

24:11.780 --> 24:14.370
Er, no, thanks.
Maybe just some water.

24:14.420 --> 24:15.460
Of course.

24:22.740 --> 24:25.170
Well, don't hold back,
I've nearly finished anyway.

24:25.220 --> 24:26.770
Um...

24:26.820 --> 24:29.450
It's perfectly all right.
I washed in it myself.

24:29.500 --> 24:32.370
All of a sudden,
I'm not very thirsty.

24:32.420 --> 24:33.770
Really?

24:33.820 --> 24:36.770
Perhaps it is time then...

24:36.820 --> 24:38.540
DEVICE WHIRS

24:40.180 --> 24:43.100
..for your mandatory
medical examination.

24:46.220 --> 24:47.570
Say, "Ah."

24:47.620 --> 24:48.690
Ah.

24:48.740 --> 24:49.970
You didn't move your lips.

24:50.020 --> 24:51.810
You're looking at my eye.

24:51.860 --> 24:53.730
Oh, yes, there we are.

24:53.780 --> 24:55.530
Easy mistake.

24:55.580 --> 24:58.010
Ah-h!
DEVICE BEEPS

24:58.060 --> 24:59.850
Now that's interesting.

24:59.900 --> 25:01.170
What? What's interesting?

25:01.220 --> 25:05.690
Deflected narcissism,
traces of passive aggressive,

25:05.740 --> 25:10.090
and a lot of muscular young men
doing sport.

25:10.140 --> 25:11.970
What are you looking at?

25:12.020 --> 25:14.930
Your subconscious. Is that sport?

25:14.980 --> 25:16.210
It could be sport.

25:16.260 --> 25:19.170
Well, stop looking.

25:19.220 --> 25:21.300
Moving onto the thorax,
such as it is...

25:23.020 --> 25:24.850
Ah, excellent.

25:24.900 --> 25:28.410
Enviable spleen! Well done.

25:28.460 --> 25:32.970
27 years old, with a projected
lifespan of exactly...

25:33.020 --> 25:34.290
Stop...right there.

25:34.340 --> 25:36.090
Oh, you're going to do quite well.

25:36.140 --> 25:40.300
But watch out for fluid retention
later, it's going to be spectacular.

25:41.460 --> 25:44.010
Well, put your clothes back on.
They are on!

25:44.060 --> 25:45.980
Oh, yes, so they are.

25:47.260 --> 25:48.490
Why are you doing this?

25:48.540 --> 25:52.530
If we are to serve together,
I need you in peak physical prowess.

25:52.580 --> 25:53.650
Eh? Ow!

25:53.700 --> 25:55.570
Why would we be serving together?

25:55.620 --> 25:58.810
The Doctor's going to come back,
isn't he? It is to be hoped.

25:58.860 --> 26:02.010
He's not just going
to abandon me here.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.650
You must stop worrying about him,
my boy.

26:04.700 --> 26:09.810
By now, he's almost certainly had
his throat cut by the violent poor.

26:09.860 --> 26:10.850
BINS CLANG

26:10.900 --> 26:12.530
DOGS BARK

26:12.580 --> 26:13.620
Oh-h!

26:23.180 --> 26:24.980
THE DOCTOR MUMBLES

26:35.660 --> 26:36.780
CLANGING

26:40.060 --> 26:42.530
Bitey. Bitey?

26:42.580 --> 26:43.660
The air...

26:44.940 --> 26:47.970
..it's bitey, it's wet and bitey.

26:48.020 --> 26:49.690
Oh, it's cold!

26:49.740 --> 26:53.260
That's right. It's cold!
It's cold, I knew it was a thing.

26:54.340 --> 26:55.420
I need, um...

26:56.340 --> 26:58.330
I need clothes.

26:58.380 --> 27:02.060
I need clothes, that's what I need.
And a big, long scarf.

27:03.060 --> 27:06.540
No, no, move on from that,
looked stupid.

27:07.540 --> 27:08.810
Um...

27:08.860 --> 27:10.540
Have you seen this face before?

27:11.740 --> 27:13.210
No.

27:13.260 --> 27:14.300
Are you sure?

27:15.460 --> 27:18.220
Sir, I have never seen that face.

27:19.780 --> 27:23.260
It's funny, because...
I'm sure that I have.

27:24.260 --> 27:26.850
You know, I never know
where the faces come from.

27:26.900 --> 27:29.490
They just pop up.
Zap! Faces like this one.

27:29.540 --> 27:32.650
Come on, look at it, have a look,
come on, look, look, look.

27:32.700 --> 27:36.700
Look, it's covered in lines,
but I didn't do the frowning.

27:38.180 --> 27:39.780
Who frowned me this face?

27:41.900 --> 27:45.170
Do you ever look in the mirror and
think, "I've seen that face before"?

27:45.220 --> 27:46.210
Yes.

27:46.260 --> 27:47.890
Really? When?

27:47.940 --> 27:50.020
Well, every time
I look in the mirror.

27:51.380 --> 27:54.090
Oh, yes, yes, yes, fair enough.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.780
Good point.
My face is fresh on, though.

27:58.740 --> 27:59.770
Er...

27:59.820 --> 28:01.020
Why this one?

28:02.420 --> 28:06.020
Why did I choose...this face?

28:09.060 --> 28:11.180
It's like I'm trying
to tell myself something,

28:12.180 --> 28:14.930
like I'm trying to make a point.
But what is so important

28:14.980 --> 28:18.130
that I can't just tell myself
what I'm thinking?

28:18.180 --> 28:20.210
Er...

28:20.260 --> 28:23.410
I'm not just being rhetorical here,
you can join in.

28:23.460 --> 28:26.410
I don't like it. What? Your face.

28:26.460 --> 28:28.130
Well, I don't like it either.

28:28.180 --> 28:29.970
Well, it's all right
up until the eyebrows.

28:30.020 --> 28:32.610
Then it just goes haywire.
Look at the eyebrows!

28:32.660 --> 28:34.570
These are attack eyebrows.

28:34.620 --> 28:37.330
You could take bottle tops
off with these!

28:37.380 --> 28:39.410
They are mighty eyebrows indeed,
sir.

28:39.460 --> 28:43.530
They're cross! They're crosser
than the rest of my face.

28:43.580 --> 28:45.370
They're independently cross.

28:45.420 --> 28:48.450
They probably want to cede
from the rest of my face

28:48.500 --> 28:50.970
and set up their own
independent state of eyebrows.

28:51.020 --> 28:54.290
That's Scot... I am Scottish.
I've gone Scottish?

28:54.340 --> 28:57.890
Oh, yes, you are.
You are definitely Scots, sir.

28:57.940 --> 28:59.730
I... I 'ear it in your voice.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.330
Oh, no, that's good.

29:01.380 --> 29:05.250
Oh-h! Oh-h!

29:05.300 --> 29:08.250
It's good
I'm Scottish, I'm Scottish.

29:08.300 --> 29:10.810
I am Scottish.

29:10.860 --> 29:14.290
I can complain about things, I can
really complain about things now.

29:14.340 --> 29:16.490
Give me your coat. No.

29:16.540 --> 29:17.850
I'm cold.

29:17.900 --> 29:19.210
I'm cold.

29:19.260 --> 29:20.450
I'm cold.

29:20.500 --> 29:23.090
Well, there's no point in us
both being cold, give me your coat.

29:23.140 --> 29:25.370
Give me your coat!

29:25.420 --> 29:27.610
No, wait.
Shut up, shut up!

29:27.660 --> 29:28.700
Shut up!

29:29.820 --> 29:33.170
I missed something,
It was here, it was here. It was...

29:33.220 --> 29:35.460
What was it I saw, what did I see?

29:38.860 --> 29:40.420
This is what I saw!

29:45.100 --> 29:47.810
Spontaneous combustion!

29:47.860 --> 29:50.020
What devilry is this, sir?

29:51.020 --> 29:53.820
I don't know,
but I probably blame the English.

29:59.740 --> 30:02.650
Hmm! Spontaneous combustion!

30:02.700 --> 30:06.050
Is that like love at first sight?
Huh! A little.

30:06.100 --> 30:08.210
It is the theory
that human beings can,

30:08.260 --> 30:11.130
with little or no inducement,
simply explode.

30:11.180 --> 30:14.250
You don't need to flirt with me,
we're already married.

30:14.300 --> 30:16.730
It's scientific nonsense, of course.

30:16.780 --> 30:18.050
Marriage?

30:18.100 --> 30:19.450
Hush!

30:19.500 --> 30:21.650
There have been nine
reported incidents

30:21.700 --> 30:24.650
of people apparently exploding
in the last month.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.970
And you think
they weren't spontaneous.

30:27.020 --> 30:32.890
I think whoever killed the dinosaur
had at least nine previous victims -

30:32.940 --> 30:36.260
all of these perished
in the same spectacular fashion.

30:37.380 --> 30:39.210
I thought you were painting me!

30:39.260 --> 30:40.370
I was working.

30:40.420 --> 30:42.090
Well, why am I posing then?

30:42.140 --> 30:45.730
Well, you brighten the room
tremendously. Chin up a little.

30:45.780 --> 30:48.060
Oh, I don't understand
why I'm doing this!

30:49.340 --> 30:50.740
Art?

30:52.620 --> 30:56.250
Now, why destroy the victims
so completely?

30:56.300 --> 30:59.810
It's difficult, it draws attention -
what advantage is to be gained?

30:59.860 --> 31:01.460
Well, tell us, then.

31:02.540 --> 31:04.010
Concealment, perhaps.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.690
Concealment?

31:05.740 --> 31:08.450
It's a fanciful theory,
but it fits the facts.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.690
By destroying the body
so completely,

31:11.740 --> 31:14.530
you conceal what is missing from it.

31:14.580 --> 31:16.250
Missing from the body?

31:16.300 --> 31:17.940
CLARA: Madame Vastra!

31:18.980 --> 31:22.370
Clara, excellent. Pop your clothes
on that chair there.

31:22.420 --> 31:24.290
Look!

31:24.340 --> 31:28.410
Advertisements, yes - so many,
it's a distressing modern trend.

31:28.460 --> 31:30.340
No, look!

31:33.420 --> 31:34.460
Look.

31:36.580 --> 31:37.620
SHE GASPS

31:38.700 --> 31:39.970
Ma'am?

31:40.020 --> 31:43.170
The game is afoot.
We're going to need a lot of tea.

31:43.220 --> 31:44.420
BELL RINGS

31:47.140 --> 31:49.210
There appears to be nothing
of significance

31:49.260 --> 31:51.330
in the rest of the newspaper,

31:51.380 --> 31:53.250
not even in the agony column.

31:53.300 --> 31:55.130
We can't know it's from the Doctor.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.490
Of course it's from the Doctor.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.530
The Impossible Girl,
that's what he calls me!

31:58.580 --> 32:01.250
He says lunch,
but not when or where?

32:01.300 --> 32:05.170
"On the other side?"
The other side of London? Bit vague.

32:05.220 --> 32:08.010
The other side of regeneration,
perhaps, once he's recovered?

32:08.060 --> 32:10.460
So what am I supposed to do -
guess where we're meeting?

32:11.740 --> 32:13.410
Perhaps that's the point.

32:13.460 --> 32:17.010
Perhaps you're supposed to prove
that you still know him.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.650
Think what that must mean for a man
who barely knows himself.

32:19.700 --> 32:22.930
It doesn't makes sense.
He doesn't do puzzles.

32:22.980 --> 32:26.140
He isn't complicated, really
doesn't have the attention span.

32:27.740 --> 32:29.100
So...

32:35.780 --> 32:37.300
..keeping it dead simple...

32:38.780 --> 32:40.100
"..on the other side."

CUTLERY CLINKS

CLARA SNIFFS

33:27.020 --> 33:28.420
SHE COUGHS

33:30.660 --> 33:34.210
What's wrong?
I don't know! Maybe the smell?

33:34.260 --> 33:36.140
I know, it's everywhere.

33:37.660 --> 33:39.100
Where did you get that coat?

33:41.380 --> 33:43.250
Er...

33:43.300 --> 33:44.530
I bought it.

33:44.580 --> 33:45.570
From where?

33:45.620 --> 33:47.140
Er, a shop. No.

33:50.060 --> 33:51.450
Might have been a tramp.

33:51.500 --> 33:52.770
You don't have any money.

33:52.820 --> 33:53.860
Er...

33:55.060 --> 33:56.130
..I had a watch!

33:56.180 --> 33:58.610
No! That watch was beautiful.

33:58.660 --> 34:00.330
It was my favourite.

34:00.380 --> 34:02.690
You swapped your favourite
watch for that coat -

34:02.740 --> 34:04.090
that's maybe not a good deal.

34:04.140 --> 34:07.060
Well, I was in a hurry,
there was a terrible smell. OK.

34:08.060 --> 34:09.730
HE LAUGHS

34:09.780 --> 34:12.290
No, no. Don't, don't...

34:12.340 --> 34:14.010
Don't, don't smile.

34:14.060 --> 34:18.170
I will smile first
and then you know it's safe to smile.

34:18.219 --> 34:20.409
Are you cross with me?
I am not cross,

34:20.460 --> 34:22.780
but if I was cross
it would be your fault and...

34:23.940 --> 34:25.489
..yes, I am cross. I guessed that.

34:25.540 --> 34:27.969
I am extremely cross.
And if I hadn't changed my face,

34:28.020 --> 34:29.090
would you be cross?

34:29.139 --> 34:30.850
I would be cross
if I wasn't cross! Why?

34:30.900 --> 34:31.940
Why?

34:35.060 --> 34:37.210
An ordinary person
wants to meet someone

34:37.260 --> 34:39.929
that they know very well
for lunch, what do they do?

34:39.980 --> 34:45.409
Well, they probably...get in touch
and suggest lunch. Mm-hm.

34:45.460 --> 34:48.449
OK, so what sort of person
would put a cryptic note in...

34:48.500 --> 34:50.130
in a newspaper advert?

34:50.179 --> 34:51.730
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

34:51.780 --> 34:53.050
Oh, go on, do, say.

34:53.100 --> 34:55.530
Well, I would say that
that person would be

34:55.580 --> 34:58.890
an egomaniac, needy,
game-player sort of person.

34:58.940 --> 35:01.090

Thank you.

35:01.140 --> 35:03.540

Well, at least that hasn't changed.

35:04.900 --> 35:07.850
And I don't suppose it ever will.
No, I don't suppose it will either.

35:07.900 --> 35:09.940
Clara, honestly...

35:11.740 --> 35:13.380
..I don't want you to change.

35:15.220 --> 35:16.610
It was no bother, really.

35:16.660 --> 35:20.810
I saw your advert, I figured it
out - happy to play your game.

35:20.860 --> 35:22.050
No.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.810
No...no, I didn't place the ad.
You placed the ad.

35:24.860 --> 35:27.370
No, I didn't. Yes,
you placed the ad, I figured it out!

35:27.420 --> 35:29.010
Impossible Girl, see, lunch?

35:29.060 --> 35:32.650
No, look, the Impossible... That is
a message FROM the Impossible Girl.

35:32.700 --> 35:35.540
FOR the Impossible...Girl.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.810
Oh? Oh?

35:40.860 --> 35:42.130
Hmm.

35:42.180 --> 35:48.010
Well, if neither of us placed
that ad, who placed...that ad?

35:48.060 --> 35:52.410
Hang on. "Egomaniac,
needy, game-player"?

35:52.460 --> 35:54.690
This could be a trap. That was me?
Never mind that.

35:54.740 --> 35:56.370
Yes, I am minding that!
Clara....

35:56.420 --> 35:58.210
You were talking about me?

35:58.260 --> 36:00.850
Clara, what is happening right now

36:00.900 --> 36:04.010
in this restaurant to you and me is
more important than your egomania.

36:04.060 --> 36:05.930
Nothing is more important
than my egomania!

36:05.980 --> 36:09.140
Right, you actually said that.
You never mention that again!

36:10.420 --> 36:13.010
It's...it's a vanity trap.

36:13.060 --> 36:16.090
You're so busy congratulating
yourself on solving the puzzle,

36:16.140 --> 36:19.090
you don't notice that you're
sticking your head in a noose.

36:19.140 --> 36:20.410
What are you doing?

36:20.460 --> 36:23.170
And that isn't the only grey one,
if you are, erm, having a cull.

36:23.220 --> 36:25.130
What, do you have a problem
with the grey ones?

36:25.180 --> 36:27.450
If I got new hair, and it was grey,
I would have a problem.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.860
Yeah, I bet you would. Meaning?

36:29.980 --> 36:31.340
It's too short.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.410
Ow! Sorry, it was
the only one out of place,

36:34.460 --> 36:36.370
I'm sure that you would
want it killed.

36:36.420 --> 36:38.770
Oooh, are you trying
to tell me something?

36:38.820 --> 36:41.410
I'm trying to measure
the air disturbance in the room.

36:41.460 --> 36:44.180
Right, moments
when you know you are boring.

36:45.540 --> 36:46.580
SLIGHT WHOOSH

36:53.580 --> 36:56.850
There is something extremely wrong
with everybody else in this room.

36:56.900 --> 36:59.810
Mmm, basically, don't you
always think that? Look at them.

36:59.860 --> 37:01.900
Don't look! You just said to look!

37:03.380 --> 37:05.060
Look without looking!

37:28.980 --> 37:31.850
OK, no. No, they're not eating.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.740
Something else they're not doing.

37:38.740 --> 37:39.900
(Breathing.)

37:46.940 --> 37:48.020
What do we do?

37:50.540 --> 37:52.290
What, you don't want to eat, do you?

37:52.340 --> 37:54.690
Hmm! Slightly lost my appetite.
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

37:54.740 --> 37:57.410
How long before they notice
that we're different? Not long.

37:57.460 --> 37:58.900
Anything we can do?

38:00.580 --> 38:02.180
How long can you hold your breath?

38:03.700 --> 38:06.850
We could just casually stroll out of
here, like we've changed our minds.

38:06.900 --> 38:09.100
Happens all the time.
Ha! Course it does.

I don't know. But don't worry,
because that's not the question.

38:51.700 --> 38:54.130
The question is,
what is this restaurant?

38:54.180 --> 38:55.890
OK, what is this restaurant?

38:55.940 --> 38:57.500
I don't know.

39:06.580 --> 39:09.100
Er...no sausages?

39:10.020 --> 39:11.050
Do you...

39:11.100 --> 39:13.860
And there's no pictures either.
Do you have a children's menu?

39:15.540 --> 39:17.410
BEEPING

39:17.460 --> 39:19.050
Any specials?

39:19.100 --> 39:20.610
Liver.

39:20.660 --> 39:22.530
I don't like liver.

39:22.580 --> 39:26.370
Spleen. Brain stem. Eyes.

39:26.420 --> 39:29.810
Mm. Is there a lot
of demand for those?

39:29.860 --> 39:32.260
I don't think
that's what's on the menu.

39:33.780 --> 39:36.050
I think we are the menu.

39:36.100 --> 39:39.220
Lungs. Skin.

39:40.620 --> 39:41.780
Excuse me.

39:44.820 --> 39:47.930
OK. Robot in a mask.

39:47.980 --> 39:49.250
It's a face.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.940
Yeah, it's very convincing.

39:53.260 --> 39:55.330
No, it's a face.

39:55.380 --> 39:56.450
Oh!

39:56.500 --> 39:57.530
Yes.

39:57.580 --> 40:01.580
Yes, what?
Yes, we have a children's menu.

40:06.340 --> 40:08.220

their efficiency.

Hello, are you the manager?

40:26.180 --> 40:28.060
I demand to speak to the manager.

40:30.220 --> 40:32.060
This is not a real restaurant,
is it?

40:33.100 --> 40:34.850
Well...

40:34.900 --> 40:38.290
it's more a sort of automated
organ collection station

40:38.340 --> 40:40.890
for the unwary diner.
Sweeney Todd without the pies.

40:40.940 --> 40:42.290
So, where are we now?

40:42.340 --> 40:46.010
Factually, an ancient spaceship,
probably buried for centuries,

40:46.060 --> 40:48.580
functionally...a larder.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.130
So why hasn't somebody come for us?

40:51.180 --> 40:52.530
We're alive.

40:52.580 --> 40:54.170
We're alive in a larder.

40:54.220 --> 40:57.290
Exactly.
It's cheaper than freezing us.

40:57.340 --> 40:58.770
OK.

40:58.820 --> 41:01.690
Are you ready?
Go for it.

41:01.740 --> 41:04.810
Don't let it roll away.
No.

41:04.860 --> 41:06.090
We've got one shot at this.

41:06.140 --> 41:08.690
Next time, make one
that doesn't roll.

41:08.740 --> 41:10.300
Go!

41:13.460 --> 41:15.900
Got it? I can only just about reach.

41:17.740 --> 41:20.940
Oh, it's at times like this
I miss Amy. Who? Nothing.

41:23.660 --> 41:26.300
Ready?
Don't miss!

41:27.300 --> 41:28.650
Oh-h!

41:28.700 --> 41:30.860
Oh.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.850
Sorry, did I hit...something?

41:34.900 --> 41:36.740
Oh, the symbolism!

41:43.580 --> 41:45.770
You should make that thing
voice-activated.

41:45.820 --> 41:48.930
Oh, for God's sake, it is, isn't
it? I don't want to talk about it.

41:48.980 --> 41:50.020
Doctor?

41:57.060 --> 41:58.100
Dormant.

41:59.220 --> 42:01.340
How do you know?
I don't. I'm just hoping.

42:05.500 --> 42:08.210
So...is it these guys
that killed the dinosaur?

42:08.260 --> 42:11.050
Well, if they're harvesting organs,

42:11.100 --> 42:13.570
a dinosaur would have some
great stuff.

42:13.620 --> 42:16.810
Why would robots need organs?
Burke and Hare from space?

42:16.860 --> 42:19.060
No, but that's a good theory.

42:21.140 --> 42:24.740
Droids harvesting spare parts.
That rings a bell.

42:33.460 --> 42:34.740
Captain, my Captain.

42:37.620 --> 42:38.970
Can he see us?

42:39.020 --> 42:40.450
Dormant. Hoping?

42:40.500 --> 42:42.340
Yep. Oh, look!

42:43.380 --> 42:45.780
He's recharging. He's asleep.

42:47.220 --> 42:49.170
Doesn't even know we're here.
Are you sure?

42:49.220 --> 42:51.100
Sure, not sure - one or the other.

42:52.100 --> 42:55.420
OK, so half-man, half-robot.
a cyborg, yeah?

42:56.980 --> 42:58.140
Oh. Oh?

42:59.220 --> 43:00.890
Oh-h. Oh?

43:00.940 --> 43:03.090
Look at the hands.

43:03.140 --> 43:04.370
What about them?

43:04.420 --> 43:05.660
Look at them. I'm looking.

43:14.100 --> 43:17.980
They don't match. These hands
don't belong to the same body.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.330
I don't understand.

43:22.380 --> 43:23.540
I don't blame you.

43:25.020 --> 43:28.010
See, this...
this is not your normal cyborg.

43:28.060 --> 43:31.490
This isn't a man turning
himself into a robot.

43:31.540 --> 43:34.690
This is a robot turning himself...

43:34.740 --> 43:37.010
into a man, piece by piece.

43:37.060 --> 43:39.450
That's what the restaurant's for.

43:39.500 --> 43:42.410
Well, it would need a constant
supply of spare parts.

43:42.460 --> 43:45.290
You can tan skin, but organs rot.

43:45.340 --> 43:47.420
Some of that metalwork looks Roman.

43:49.860 --> 43:51.970
Wonder how long it's been around,

43:52.020 --> 43:55.010
how much of the original
is even left.

43:55.060 --> 43:57.180
The eyeballs look very fresh,
though. Eugh!

43:58.660 --> 43:59.860
ARM CLICKS
Aggh!

44:01.020 --> 44:03.060
WHIRRING

44:08.140 --> 44:09.460
(Is it awake?)

44:12.060 --> 44:14.260
It's waking up...I think.

44:18.420 --> 44:19.460
OK, let's go.

44:29.260 --> 44:31.170
HE PANTS

44:31.220 --> 44:33.500
I've seen this before.
I'm missing something!

44:34.860 --> 44:37.730
Doctor! It's the brand-new head,
rebooting!

44:37.780 --> 44:38.970
Come on!

44:39.020 --> 44:40.730
I've seen this before!

44:40.780 --> 44:43.180
Oh, hurry up, get out.

44:46.900 --> 44:48.620
DOOR CLANGS
Doctor!

44:50.900 --> 44:51.940
Quickly!

44:57.020 --> 44:59.570
Sorry, too slow. There's no
point in them catching us both.

44:59.620 --> 45:01.700
Well, give me the screwdriver!

45:06.620 --> 45:07.900
I might need it.

45:17.540 --> 45:19.700
SHE GASPS
Doctor?

45:23.020 --> 45:25.220
FOOTSTEPS

45:28.700 --> 45:31.220
Oh!
SHE SOBS

45:56.420 --> 45:58.460
HE RATTLES

46:06.980 --> 46:08.660
'Something else they're not doing.'

46:09.660 --> 46:10.940
Breathing.

46:17.940 --> 46:20.300
How long can you hold your breath?

46:30.940 --> 46:33.340
HE WHIRS MECHANICALLY

47:44.340 --> 47:45.860
CLANGING

48:04.540 --> 48:05.660
SHE EXHALES DEEPLY

48:10.620 --> 48:11.940
Bring her.

48:15.420 --> 48:16.460
DREAMY ECHOING

48:26.060 --> 48:27.100
CHILDREN LAUGH

48:30.100 --> 48:33.610
All right, stop.
Stop it, all of you, now.

48:33.660 --> 48:35.090
Ha-ha! It's her first day.

48:35.140 --> 48:36.740
CHILDREN CONTINUE TO LAUGH

48:38.660 --> 48:40.050
If you don't stop it,

48:40.100 --> 48:42.290
I'm going to have each
and every single one of you

48:42.340 --> 48:43.570
kicked out of this school!

48:43.620 --> 48:45.490
Go on, then. Do it!

48:45.540 --> 48:46.580
SPEECH ECHOES

48:58.860 --> 49:00.340
Where is the other one?

49:07.060 --> 49:09.530
There was another. Where is he?

49:09.580 --> 49:10.860
Where is the other?

49:14.140 --> 49:15.220
You will tell us...

49:17.020 --> 49:19.060
..or you will be destroyed.

49:21.180 --> 49:22.690
(What did you say?)

49:22.740 --> 49:23.900
You will tell us.

49:25.460 --> 49:29.100
Yeah, I know, or what?
You will die.

49:30.100 --> 49:31.170
'Go on, then.'

49:31.220 --> 49:32.660
Do it.

49:41.620 --> 49:43.340
Go on, then.

49:45.180 --> 49:46.220
Do it.

49:49.700 --> 49:51.970
I'm not going to answer
any of your questions,

49:52.020 --> 49:55.380
so you have to do it.
You have to kill me.

49:56.380 --> 49:58.940
Threats don't work
unless you deliver.

50:02.620 --> 50:06.010
You will tell us
where the other one is. Nope.

50:06.060 --> 50:08.530
You will be destroyed.
Destroy me, then.

50:08.580 --> 50:10.530
And if you don't, then...

50:10.580 --> 50:13.020
I not going to believe a single
threat you make from now on.

50:14.740 --> 50:17.490
Of course, if I'm dead, then...

50:17.540 --> 50:21.130
I can't tell you where
the other one went, then...

50:21.180 --> 50:23.580
You need to keep this place
down here a secret, don't you?

50:25.300 --> 50:27.610
Never start
with your final sanction.

50:27.660 --> 50:29.780
You've got nowhere to go
but backwards.

50:34.380 --> 50:35.940
Humans feel pain.

50:36.900 --> 50:39.620
Bigger threat to smaller threat -
see what I mean? Backwards.

50:41.180 --> 50:44.940
The information can be extracted
by means of your suffering.

50:46.020 --> 50:47.530
Are you trying to scare me?

50:47.580 --> 50:50.770
Well, cos I'm already bloody
terrified of dying...

50:50.820 --> 50:52.890
and I'll endure a lot of pain

50:52.940 --> 50:55.170
for a very long time
before I give up the information

50:55.220 --> 50:57.250
that's keeping me alive.
How long have you got?

50:57.300 --> 50:58.540
MECHANICAL WHIRRING

51:06.820 --> 51:10.090
All you can offer me is my life -
what you can't do is threaten it.

51:10.140 --> 51:12.180
You can negotiate.

51:13.380 --> 51:15.850
OK, OK, OK! OK, yes,

51:15.900 --> 51:17.850
yes, yes, I'm crying

51:17.900 --> 51:21.570
and it's just because
I am very frightened of you.

51:21.620 --> 51:23.410
If you know anything
about human beings,

51:23.460 --> 51:25.820
that means you...
you're in a lot trouble.

51:28.260 --> 51:30.290
We will not negotiate.

51:30.340 --> 51:31.730
You don't have a choice.

51:31.780 --> 51:35.650
I tell you what, I'll answer
your questions if you answer mine.

51:35.700 --> 51:38.570
We will not answer questions.

51:38.620 --> 51:41.370
We'll take turns, I'll go first.
Why did you kill the dinosaur?

51:41.420 --> 51:44.010
We will not answer questions.
Why did you kill the dinosaur?

51:44.060 --> 51:47.130
We will not answer questions!
Then you might as well kill me,

51:47.180 --> 51:49.220
because I'm not talking
again till you do.

51:51.060 --> 51:52.380
SHE EXHALES

52:00.820 --> 52:04.090
Within the optic nerve
of the dinosaur is material of use

52:04.140 --> 52:05.850
to our computer systems.

52:05.900 --> 52:08.740
You burned a whole dinosaur
for a spare part?

52:09.740 --> 52:11.780
No, no, hang on.

52:13.580 --> 52:15.490
You know what's in
a dinosaur's optic nerve,

52:15.540 --> 52:17.260
which means you've seen them before.

52:18.620 --> 52:20.250
Where is the other one?

52:20.300 --> 52:22.890
How long have you been
rebuilding yourselves?

52:22.940 --> 52:26.420
Look at the state of you! Is there
any real you left? What's the point?

52:31.580 --> 52:33.900
We will reach the promised land.

52:36.980 --> 52:39.290
The what, the promised land?
What's that?

52:39.340 --> 52:41.060
Where is the other one?

52:44.780 --> 52:45.940
I don't know.

52:48.860 --> 52:52.780
But I know where he will be...
where he will always be.

52:55.420 --> 52:57.500
If the Doctor is still the Doctor...

53:00.380 --> 53:01.700
..he will have my back.

53:06.820 --> 53:08.650
SHE GASPS

53:08.700 --> 53:12.700
I'm right, aren't I? Go on.
Please, please, God, say I'm right.

53:19.820 --> 53:24.250
Hello, hello, rubbish robots
from the dawn of time,

53:24.300 --> 53:27.250
thank you for all
the gratuitous information.

53:27.300 --> 53:30.730
Five foot one and crying -
you never stood a chance.

53:30.780 --> 53:32.100
Stop it!

53:35.340 --> 53:38.210
This is your power source,
and feeble though it is,

53:38.260 --> 53:39.850
I can use it to blow this whole room

53:39.900 --> 53:42.370
if I see one thing
that I don't like,

53:42.420 --> 53:44.970
and that includes karaoke and mime,
so take no chances.

53:45.020 --> 53:46.010
See, Clara?

53:46.060 --> 53:48.810
That's how you disguise
yourself as a Droid.

53:48.860 --> 53:51.850
Yeah, well, I didn't have a lot of
time, I'd been suddenly abandoned.

53:51.900 --> 53:54.850
Sorry. Well, no, actually I'm not,
you're brilliant on adrenaline.

53:54.900 --> 53:56.410
And you were out of your depth, sir.

53:56.460 --> 53:58.050
Never try and control
a control freak.

53:58.100 --> 54:00.010
I am not a control freak!

54:00.060 --> 54:02.490
Yes, ma'am.
Oh!

54:02.540 --> 54:04.090
Why are you here?

54:04.140 --> 54:05.580
Why did you invite us?

54:07.100 --> 54:08.820
The message, in the paper...

54:10.660 --> 54:12.100
..that was you, wasn't it?

54:18.140 --> 54:22.170
Oh. I hate being wrong in public.
Everybody forget that happened.

54:22.220 --> 54:23.690
Clara, say the word.

54:23.740 --> 54:25.930
What word? They never sent you
in here without a word.

54:25.980 --> 54:27.930
I don't want to say it.
I've guessed already.

54:27.980 --> 54:29.540
BOTH: Geronimo!

54:40.820 --> 54:42.810
Remain still
and lay down your weapons,

54:42.860 --> 54:44.450
in the name of the British Empire!

54:44.500 --> 54:45.580
Argh!

54:46.780 --> 54:49.170
Strax! Sorry.

54:49.220 --> 54:51.770
I've told you before -
take the stairs.

54:51.820 --> 54:53.010
Oh, look. The cavalry.

54:53.060 --> 54:55.170
I burned an ancient,
beautiful creature

54:55.220 --> 54:56.850
for one inch of optic nerve.

54:56.900 --> 54:59.010
What do you think you can
accomplish, little man?

54:59.060 --> 55:00.460
What do you? Vastra?

55:01.820 --> 55:06.330
The establishment upstairs has been
disabled with maximum prejudice,

55:06.380 --> 55:09.330
and the authorities summoned.
Hang on, she called the police?

55:09.380 --> 55:11.730
We never do that, we should start.
You see?

55:11.780 --> 55:13.290
Destroy us if you will,

55:13.340 --> 55:15.500
they're still going to
close your restaurant.

55:17.020 --> 55:18.530
That was going to sound better.

55:18.580 --> 55:20.260
Then we will destroy you.

55:30.900 --> 55:32.060
No, you won't.

55:33.580 --> 55:35.210
You're logical. You have restraint.

55:35.260 --> 55:37.370
You kill to survive -
you're not a murderer.

55:37.420 --> 55:39.170
He's not a what?
This is a slaughterhouse.

55:39.220 --> 55:41.890
And how does that make it
different from any other restaurant?

55:41.940 --> 55:44.210
You weren't vegetarian the last time
I checked. This is over.

55:44.260 --> 55:45.970
Killing us won't change that.

55:46.020 --> 55:48.330
What would be the point?
To find the promised land.

55:48.380 --> 55:51.170
You're millions of years old, it's
time you knew - there isn't one.

55:51.220 --> 55:52.730
I am in search of paradise.

55:52.780 --> 55:56.180
Yeah, well, me too.
I'm not going to make it either.

55:58.300 --> 55:59.610
Doctor!

55:59.660 --> 56:02.730
I will leave in the escape capsule.
Destroy where necessary.

56:02.780 --> 56:04.090
Escape capsule?

56:04.140 --> 56:07.410
This ship is millions of years old,
it'll never fly.

56:07.460 --> 56:08.930
It has been repaired.

56:08.980 --> 56:10.610
What with?

56:10.660 --> 56:11.930
You.

56:11.980 --> 56:13.580
Defensive positions everyone.

56:16.420 --> 56:18.530
Doctor! He's getting away!

56:18.580 --> 56:21.780
Your friend is intelligent.
He'll know better than to follow me.

56:28.540 --> 56:29.700
HE GROANS

56:33.300 --> 56:35.860
Right, here we are,
this is the place, come with me.

56:37.700 --> 56:39.530
It is our intent to leave.

56:39.580 --> 56:42.010
If it is your intent to stop us,

56:42.060 --> 56:44.340
perhaps we should get
down to business.

56:48.780 --> 56:51.770
Dear Lord, what has she landed us
with this time?

56:51.820 --> 56:53.060
MECHANICAL WHIRRING

56:57.180 --> 56:58.700
The restaurant is closed.

57:08.140 --> 57:11.460
Keep everyone out.
No-one goes in there!

57:21.740 --> 57:23.290
What are you doing?

57:23.340 --> 57:25.860
I've got the horrible feeling
I'm going to have to kill you.

57:27.740 --> 57:30.290
I thought you might appreciate
a drink first.

57:30.340 --> 57:31.580
I know I would.

57:37.660 --> 57:38.700
RUMBLING

57:42.460 --> 57:43.900
Watch out!

57:52.380 --> 57:57.290
51st century, right? Time travelling
spaceship, crashed in the past.

57:57.340 --> 57:59.500
You're trying to get home
the long way round.

58:00.900 --> 58:02.370
I go to the promised land.

58:02.420 --> 58:04.100
So you keep saying.

58:05.620 --> 58:10.330
OK, so your restaurant is made
out of your old ship,

58:10.380 --> 58:15.090
but you're wasting your time,
it can't ever fly.

58:15.140 --> 58:16.890
The escape pod is viable.

58:16.940 --> 58:20.810
How? You can't patch up
a spaceship with human remains.

58:20.860 --> 58:23.100
You know, this really is
ringing a bell.

58:27.460 --> 58:31.620
OK, that's clever.
How are you powering it?

58:32.660 --> 58:34.380
Skin.

58:44.220 --> 58:46.980
Get to the station!
We need more men!

58:48.020 --> 58:50.530
What shall I tell them is happening?

58:50.580 --> 58:52.450
Go!

58:52.500 --> 58:54.050
How many do you estimate, my dear?

58:54.100 --> 58:57.890
More than upstairs, about 20, 30?

58:57.940 --> 58:59.930
The ones upstairs were mere decoys.

58:59.980 --> 59:03.620
These are battle-ready.
I anticipate a challenge.

59:04.860 --> 59:07.930
Don't worry, my boy,
we shall die in glory!

59:07.980 --> 59:10.980
OK. Good-o!

59:21.060 --> 59:22.380
"SS Marie Antoinette."

59:24.100 --> 59:27.890
Out-of-control repair Droids,
cannibalising human beings.

59:27.940 --> 59:31.810
I know that this is familiar,
but I just can't seem to place it.

59:31.860 --> 59:33.290
How would you kill me?

59:33.340 --> 59:36.260
"Sister ship of
the Madame De Pompadour."

59:39.580 --> 59:40.820
Nope, not getting it.

59:42.260 --> 59:43.610
How would you kill me?

59:43.660 --> 59:46.700
Why don't you have a drink
first? It's only human.

59:47.860 --> 59:49.250
I am not human.

59:49.300 --> 59:50.380
Neither am I.

59:51.660 --> 59:54.170
Why can't you stay dead, coward!

59:54.220 --> 59:55.260
SWORDS CLASH

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.420
What do you think of the view?

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.980
I do not think of it.
I don't think of it. I don't.

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.330
Droids and apostrophes,
I could write a book,

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:23.100
except you are...barely
a Droid any more.

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.540
There's more human in you
than machine.

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:34.260
So tell me...
what do you think of the view?

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:47.650
It is beautiful.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:52.130
No, it isn't. It's just far away.
Everything looks too small.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:58.370
I prefer it down there. Everything
is huge. Everything is so important.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:03.370
Every detail, every moment,
every life clung to.

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.130
How could you kill me? For the same
reason that you're asking me

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.740
that question - because you don't
really want to carry on.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.530
What'll happen to the other Droids
when you die?

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:17.940
You're the control node, aren't you?
Presumably they'll deactivate.

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:22.050
I will not die.
I will reach the promised land.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.010
There isn't any promised land.

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.450
This is just... It's a superstition
that you have picked up

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.130
from all the humanity
you've stuffed inside yourself.

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:31.460
I am not dead.

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.460
You are a broom.

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.410
Question -

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:42.130
you take a broom,
you replace the handle,

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.090
and then later
you replace the brush

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:48.330
and you do that over and over again.
Is it still the same broom?

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:51.650
Answer - no, of course it isn't.
But you can still sweep the floor.

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.210
Which is not strictly relevant,
skip that last part.

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.330
You have replaced every
piece of yourself,

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.290
mechanical and organic,
time and time again -

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:02.300
there's not a trace
of the original you left.

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.660
You probably can't even remember
where you got that face from.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.100
It cannot end.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:21.050
It has to. You know it does.
And there's only one way out.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.650
Self-destruction is against
my basic program.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:25.820
And murder is against mine!

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.540
Jenny!

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:42.820
Hold your breath! They're stupid.
Everybody hold their breath.

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.530
'I can't do it. I can't.'

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:08.780
'Be brave, my love.
I can store oxygen in my lungs.'

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.180
'Share with me!'

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:24.250
You are stronger than you look.
And I'm hoping you are too.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.940
This...is over.

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.500
Are you capable of admitting that?

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.690
Do you have it in you to murder me?

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:38.020
Those people down there.
They're never small to me.

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:42.530
Don't make assumptions about how far
I will go to protect them,

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.450
because I've already come
a very long way.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:48.100
And unlike you, I don't expect
to reach the promised land.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:04:00.580
You realise, of course, one of us is
lying about our basic programming.

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.250
Yes.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.500
And I think we both know
who that is.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.330
Stop!

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.140
THEY EXHALE

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:04.940
Whoa.

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:14.130
You're sure he'd come back here?

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.090
There was no trace of him
in the wreckage,

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.170
they searched
all Parliament Hill.

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.540
Where else would he go?

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.380
I fear we have missed him.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.220
Please come in.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.530
I'm not interrupting?
I should be glad of your company.

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.890
What can I do for you?

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.410
Ah, well, that's exactly
what I was going to ask you.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.980
Seems like I'm stuck here now.
Got a vacancy?

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:57.170
You would be very welcome
to join our little household,

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:01.410
but I have it
on the highest authority

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:04.050
that the Doctor will be returning
for you very soon.

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.140
Whose authority?

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:09.770
Well, the person who knows him
best in all the universe.

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.300
And who's that?

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:14.300
Miss Clara Oswald...

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:20.610
..who perhaps has, by instinct,
already dressed to leave.

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.660
I just wanted a change of clothes.

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.540
I don't think I know who
the Doctor is any more.

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:34.490
METALLIC THRUMMING

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:37.100
It would seem, my dear,
you are very wrong about that.

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:39.220
Clara!

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.860
Give him hell.
He'll always need it.

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:07.330
You've redecorated. Yes.
I don't like it.

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:09.370
Not completely entirely
convinced myself.

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.850
I think there should be more round
things on the walls.

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.460
I used to have lots of round things.
I wonder where I put them.

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:29.570
I'm the Doctor.

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:33.820
I've lived for over 2,000 years
and not all of them were good.

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:38.370
I've made many mistakes,

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:41.220
and it's about time that
I did something about that.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:48.250
Clara, I'm not your boyfriend.

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.060
I never thought you were.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.180
I never said it was your mistake.

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.540
METALLIC THRUMMING

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.220
What do you think?

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.050
Who put that advert in the paper?
Who gave you my number?

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.810
A long time ago, remember?

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.770
You were given the number
of a computer helpline,

01:08:18.819 --> 01:08:21.210
and you ended up phoning the
TARDIS. Who gave you that number?

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.930
The woman. The woman in the shop.

01:08:22.979 --> 01:08:26.140
Then there's a woman out there who's
very keen that we stay together.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.260
How do you feel on the subject?

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.300
Am I home?

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.540
If you want to be.

01:08:45.779 --> 01:08:47.540
I'm sorry.

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:50.979
I'm... I'm so, so sorry...

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.540
..but I don't think
I know who you are any more.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.060
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.380
You'd better get that.
It might be your boyfriend.

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:08.770
Shut up.

01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:10.220
I don't have a boyfriend.

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:20.740
Hello!

01:09:23.779 --> 01:09:25.290
Hello?

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.689
'It's me.'
Yes, it's you, who's this?

01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.529
'It's me, Clara.

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:31.620
'The Doctor.'

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:39.450
What do you mean, the Doctor?

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:43.130
I'm phoning you from Trenzalore...

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:46.529
I don't...
'..from before I changed.

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:50.090
'I mean it's all still
to happen for me, it's coming.

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:51.850
'Oh, it's a-coming...'

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:52.939
DIALLING TONE

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.090
'Not long now.'

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:03.900
I can...feel it.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:15.370
Why? Why would you do this?

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.860
'Because I think it's going
to be a whopper...'

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:22.090
..and I think you might be scared.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:27.170
'And however scared you are, Clara,
the man you are with right now...'

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:31.330
the man I hope you are with,
believe me,

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:36.130
he is more scared than anything
you can imagine right now

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.250
'and he...

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.940
'he needs you.'

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.130
So who is it?

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.970
'Is that the Doctor?'

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.580
Is that the Doctor?

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.530
Yes.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.970
'He sounds old.'

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.380
Please tell me I didn't get old.
Anything but old!

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.100
'I was young.'

01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:01.900
Oh... Is he grey?

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:05.100
Yes.

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:11.900
Clara, please, eh,
for me, help him.

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:14.980
'Go on...'

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.340
..and don't be afraid.

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.540
Goodbye, Clara.

01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:37.380
Miss you.

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:49.420
Well?

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.260
Well, what?

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:57.170
He asked you a question.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:58.850
Will you help me?

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:00.540
You shouldn't have been listening.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.860
I wasn't. I didn't need to.
That was me talking.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.370
You can't see me, can you?

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.420
You look at me,
and you can't see me.

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:18.140
Have you any idea what that's like?

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.660
I'm not on the phone,
I'm right here...

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.180
..standing in front of you.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.420
Please, just...

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:35.780
..just see me.

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:01.090
Thank you.

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:03.210
For what?

01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:04.900
Phoning.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:14.770
I... I don't think that I'm
a hugging person now.

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:17.140
I'm not sure you get a vote.

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:20.060
Whatever you say.

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:23.130
This isn't my home, by the way.

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:27.260
Sorry, I'm sorry about that,
I missed.

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:29.850
Where are we?

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:31.490
Glasgow, I think.

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.370
Ah! You'll fit right in.

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:34.900
SCOTTISH ACCENT: Scottish.

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.300
Right, shall we, er...

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:43.730
Do you want to go
and get some coffee or...

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:46.010
chips or...something,

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.370
or chips and coffee?

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:51.610
Coffee. Coffee would be great.
You're buying!

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.300
I don't have any money.
You're fetching, then.

01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:58.090
I'm not sure that I'm
the fetching sort...

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:00.860
Yeah, still not sure you get a vote.

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:09.700
MECHANICAL WHIRRING

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:17.980
Hello!

01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:24.370
I'm Missy. You made it.

01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:27.740
I hope my boyfriend wasn't
too mean to you.

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:31.530
Boy...friend?

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:35.490
Now did he push you out of that
thing, or did you fall?

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.130
Couldn't really tell.

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:40.770
He can be very mean sometimes,

01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:45.060
except to me, of course,
because he...loves me so much.

01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:49.660
I do like his new accent, though.
Think I might keep it.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.050
Where am I?

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.530
Well, where do you think you are?

01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:00.490
Look around you, you made it.

01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:02.260
The promised land.

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.460
Paradise!

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.700
Welcome...

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.220
..to heaven.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.340
SHE CRUNCHES

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:29.370
Where the hell have you been?

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.770
It's not my fault, I got distracted.
By what?

01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:33.890
You can always find something.
Come on!

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.530
Where are we going?

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.090
Into darkness.

01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.740
Welcome to the most dangerous
place in the universe.

01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:45.490
They're coming! They're coming!

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.410
Aristotle!

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.650
The enemy are right on top of us!

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:51.810
I'm sorry.

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:55.460
Exterminate...Doctor!

01:15:56.305 --> 01:16:02.435
