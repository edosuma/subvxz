00:06.374 --> 00:06.940
Previously, on "Colony"...

00:09.110 --> 00:11.579
- Do you have keys for that?
- My dad was DWP.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.714
He had keys for everything.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.250
- What's that noise?
- It's the wall up above us.

00:16.284 --> 00:17.818
- Oh, my God.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.220
We're outside the Colony,
aren't we?

00:19.253 --> 00:20.654
- For that last three nights,

00:20.688 --> 00:22.190
I've been monitoring the skies,

00:22.223 --> 00:24.558
I saw something up there.
- You have a telescope?

00:24.592 --> 00:27.061
- I got a small one.
Been working on a bigger one.

00:27.095 --> 00:29.897
- Get on your knees.
Do it now!

00:29.930 --> 00:31.332
That guy we caught was doing
pirate radio,

00:31.365 --> 00:32.933
yeah,
but he's not Geronimo.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.236
- Hey, Will? Check it out.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.871
- Detainee said this is where he
picked up the radio scripts.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.240
- You think all these cells

00:39.273 --> 00:41.075
are operating independently.
- I do.

00:41.109 --> 00:43.444
- So who is Geronimo?
- That's a very good question.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.913
- These are photos of people
coming and going

00:45.946 --> 00:47.948
from the Green Zone.
Point out Will's boss to me.

00:59.360 --> 00:59.627

01:19.480 --> 01:23.217
* Do you think you care?

01:23.251 --> 01:26.187

01:26.220 --> 01:28.522
* Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:28.556 --> 01:32.193

whoa, oh, oh *

01:46.740 --> 01:49.410
* Oh, oh, oh-oh

* So can you feel me?

01:52.613 --> 01:56.184
* You know you can

01:56.184 --> 01:59.420
* And you know you've got me

01:59.453 --> 02:01.555

[sirens wailing]

02:48.869 --> 02:50.037
- Get down!
Down!

02:50.070 --> 02:53.073
Come on!
[overlapping yelling]

02:54.708 --> 02:57.611
Get down!
Down!

02:57.645 --> 03:00.848
- Hold him down!
- Get his arm! Get his arm!

03:00.881 --> 03:03.251
- Drop it, now!
- Stop moving!

- Hey, baby.
It's six in the morning.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.592
What are you doing?
- Couldn't sleep.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.560
Remembered we had
some extra paint out back,

03:46.594 --> 03:49.096
and...

03:49.129 --> 03:50.931
it matches
close enough, right?

03:50.964 --> 03:53.467
- Yeah.
[knock at door]

03:58.005 --> 03:59.973
[pound at door]
- Will, I know you're in there.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.910
Open up.

04:02.943 --> 04:06.046
- This better be good,
like I won the lottery good.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.481
- You did.

04:07.515 --> 04:10.217
Instant coffee
that expired two years ago.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.185
Oh, good morning,
Katie.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.054
- Morning, Beau.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.425
- Can we talk in private?

04:20.328 --> 04:23.531
- Yeah.
Uh...yeah.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.566
I'll go take a shower.

04:30.538 --> 04:33.073
- What's up?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.842
- Phyllis is dead.
Homicide.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.611
- What?
- Yeah.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.913
- When did this happen?
- Last night.

04:39.947 --> 04:44.017
She was shot in her home
up in the GZ.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.787
Close range.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.357
Her husband
was murdered too.

[tense music]

05:06.039 --> 05:14.047

05:18.386 --> 05:21.955
- Her husband
was a stroke victim.

05:21.989 --> 05:26.126
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

05:26.159 --> 05:30.097
I just--I-I can't believe
that this happened.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.802
- Where are the bodies?
- They took them to the morgue.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.204
Both Phyllis and her husband
were shot at close range.

05:37.237 --> 05:38.739
Looks like a single assailant.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.809
- Yeah, a good one.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.043
- You guys
are gonna want to see

05:43.076 --> 05:45.679
what's in the living room.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.717
- Where does
this evidence go?

05:57.124 --> 05:59.627
- [sighs]

06:04.197 --> 06:06.199
- Jesus.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.843
This is very bad.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.110
You understand that, right?

06:17.144 --> 06:18.579
- Yes, of course we do.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.147
- Phyllis had direct access
to our Hosts.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.982
There's only a few people
in that category.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.617
How does one of
the most important people

06:23.651 --> 06:25.586
in the entire
Transitional Authority

06:25.619 --> 06:28.489
get killed by Geronimo
right here?

06:28.522 --> 06:30.257
Right under our noses?

06:30.290 --> 06:33.093
- Because Geronimo's probably
operating out of the GZ.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.028
- You think Geronimo's up here?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.664
- Luis Ortega,
the announcer we caught,

06:36.697 --> 06:39.099
was picking up
his radio broadcasts

06:39.132 --> 06:41.602
from a drainage pipe
that runs from the flats

06:41.635 --> 06:43.303
right up to here.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.805
- Phyllis new about this?

06:44.838 --> 06:48.942
- She told me
the GZ was fair game.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.878
- Okay.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.981
But if you go sniffing around,
you better be very discreet

06:54.014 --> 06:56.316
and very clear about
what you're doing.

06:56.349 --> 06:57.317
- Yeah, of course.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.187
- Find Geronimo.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.294
- [sighs]

07:07.327 --> 07:09.530
[radio beeps]

07:09.563 --> 07:13.233
- Yeah, this is McMahon.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.637
Yeah, yeah, bring him
to the post office.

07:16.670 --> 07:21.241
They just caught one of
Geronimo's guys at the pipe.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.981
- Snyder always this involved?
- No, never.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.083
He'd come around once in a while
to see Phyllis.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.521
- This Geronimo thing's put
a bee up his bonnet.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.826
- I got this.

07:43.531 --> 07:46.534
Hey, I'm Will Bowman.
What's your name?

07:46.534 --> 07:49.537
- Shawn Miller.
But I didn't do anything.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.939
My dad's the head of
Public Health and Hospitals.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.841
You should know that.
- That's awesome.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.643
I look forward to meeting him
when you all get

07:55.676 --> 07:59.112
put on the bus to the Factory.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.848
- Wait, no,
you can't do that.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.816
- You were transporting
Resistance propaganda

08:02.850 --> 08:04.552
up in the Green Zone.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.854
the hell you thinking?

08:06.887 --> 08:09.590
How old are you, kid?

08:09.623 --> 08:12.726
- 18.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.664
- I got a son
just about your age.

08:16.697 --> 08:20.834
So I'm gonna give you one chance
to help yourself here.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.336
One chance.

08:23.370 --> 08:26.974
Who gave you the posters?

08:30.077 --> 08:33.080
[overlapping chatter]

08:38.952 --> 08:43.056
- Keep walking.
I'm just gonna walk with you.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.925
- Thank you for meeting me.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.094
- This isn't the best time
for us to be seen together.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.596
You said it was urgent?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.964
- Phyllis is dead.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.368
You already knew.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.104
Who killed her?

08:57.137 --> 08:59.707
- We knew they had someone
essential working for them.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.675
You helped us figure out who.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.176
You did good work.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.845
- I thought we were just
gathering intelligence.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.314
- She was a threat.
To all of us.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.617
Her job was to erase us.

09:09.617 --> 09:12.820
Our job...
was to not let that happen.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.227
- Good morning.

[siren wails]

Move out!

09:34.274 --> 09:35.876
- Get in position.
We go on my mark.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.046
- What's happening?
Hey! Hey, hold on.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.049
You can't come up here.
- Oh, my God! Are you okay?

Fire in the hole!

- That side clear.

- 10-3, around the back!
- Move it around back!

10:23.924 --> 10:25.926
- C! Nothing here!

10:25.959 --> 10:27.795
- Geronimo's living here?

10:27.828 --> 10:29.129
I don't think so.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.331
- Yeah, no shit.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.174
- Beau...

Give me your arms!

All right, get up!

- Bram.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.794
I know. It's weird.

12:20.808 --> 12:23.476
- Wow.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.478
- I just found this place
last week.

12:25.545 --> 12:29.850
It's some kind of
food distribution center.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.652
- How many times have you been
outside the walls?

12:32.719 --> 12:35.722
- 11, but who's counting?

12:35.823 --> 12:37.657
- And you haven't
seen anybody?

12:37.724 --> 12:40.560
- Nope. Nobody.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.536
Only take stuff that's hard to
get inside the bloc.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.743
- You mean like coffee?

12:56.844 --> 13:00.580
- Holy shit.
You found coffee?

13:02.883 --> 13:06.186
- Hazelnut Specialty Blend.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.158
[inhales deeply]

13:11.224 --> 13:12.725
I'm not much for
flavored coffee,

but man, that smell...

13:14.327 --> 13:15.728
- [giggles]

13:15.863 --> 13:18.866
Good run for our first day.
- Yeah.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.480
- This is
a special announcement

13:33.546 --> 13:36.516
from the
Transitional Authority.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.952
- My fellow citizens,

13:39.019 --> 13:41.254
thanks to the diligent efforts
of our Proxy,

13:41.321 --> 13:44.892
Alan Snyder,
today is a historic day

13:44.892 --> 13:46.894
for the Los Angeles Colony.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.496
In a daring raid this morning
by the brave men and women

13:49.562 --> 13:51.999
of our
Homeland Security forces,

13:52.065 --> 13:55.535
Geronimo's headquarters in the
La Brea district were breached.

13:55.602 --> 13:58.371
Many of his most trusted
lieutenants were killed

13:58.438 --> 14:00.440
in a violent firefight,

14:00.507 --> 14:02.675
and some of our own
brave soldiers

14:02.742 --> 14:04.912
gave their lives in the effort.

14:04.978 --> 14:08.681
But the operation ended
in overwhelming victory.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.919
Remember where you are
right now, my fellow citizens,

14:11.919 --> 14:13.586
because on this great day,

14:13.653 --> 14:17.590
the selfish forces of terror
have been defeated.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.030
- Those two didn't
firebomb my house,

14:23.096 --> 14:24.731
and they definitely didn't
kill Phyllis,

14:24.797 --> 14:26.533
so why the hell is Snyder
announcing to the world

14:26.599 --> 14:28.969
that Geronimo's been captured?

14:29.036 --> 14:32.205
- Because, like he said,
he needs a victory.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.107
- That's a big problem,

14:34.174 --> 14:37.444
'cause the guys doing all
the damage are still out there.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.813
- Which means
we're just getting started.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.549
- Snyder is here.

14:42.615 --> 14:47.254
He's down in interrogation.
He wants to see you.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.789
- [sighs]
- Have fun.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.424
- Yeah.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.461
[overlapping chatter]

15:04.304 --> 15:06.406
[buzzer sounds]

15:07.740 --> 15:09.309
- That's Geronimo?

15:09.376 --> 15:11.744
Silver Lake and Echo Park?

15:11.811 --> 15:13.713
I just announced
to the entire bloc

15:13.780 --> 15:15.415
that we caught
a fearsome terrorist.

15:15.482 --> 15:19.052
- You might've checked in first.

15:19.119 --> 15:22.255
- Hello?
How do I get her?

15:22.322 --> 15:24.024
He--hello?
Hello?

15:24.091 --> 15:27.194
Can you hear me?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.595
You know how to work that?

15:28.661 --> 15:30.763
- Yeah, you bet.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.709
- Yes, sir?
- Those two--

15:42.775 --> 15:44.177
do they know anything
about the attacks?

15:44.244 --> 15:45.612
- Unlikely.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.047
Before we got one minute
into the first cycle,

15:47.114 --> 15:48.915
He broke
just from watching her.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.617
- They didn't carry out
any attacks?

15:50.683 --> 15:52.285
- No, sir.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.720
- They're not connected
to any terrorist cells?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.555
- No, sir.
- So, who are they?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.557
- He's an ad executive
and she's a graphic artist.

15:57.624 --> 16:01.361
- Come on.
We're going in there.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.396
[both whimper]

16:06.033 --> 16:07.300
You're Geronimo?

16:07.367 --> 16:09.469
- Proxy--
- Snyder. That's right.

16:09.536 --> 16:12.505
The two of you
are Geronimo?

16:12.572 --> 16:14.341
- Yes.
- Who were you working for?

16:14.407 --> 16:16.043
- No one.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.877
- We were working for
every citizen of this bloc,

16:17.944 --> 16:22.049
Nazi collaborator asshole.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.484
- You think it's a good idea
for you to be

16:24.551 --> 16:26.053
saying things
like that to me?

16:26.053 --> 16:27.654
- You're gonna
kill us anyway.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.522
Or ship us off to the Factory,
which is just--

16:29.589 --> 16:32.359
- Why did you do it?

16:32.425 --> 16:34.561
- We didn't have guns.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.797
We had something more powerful.
We had words and images.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.367
We had the power
to get inside people's heads.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.502
- That's great, so you
inspired real insurgents

16:42.569 --> 16:44.971
running around down the flats,
killing innocent people

16:45.072 --> 16:47.840
in your name.
That's real noble.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.877
- Seriously, how are you doing
what you're doing?

16:50.943 --> 16:53.313
You're not one of them.
You are one of us.

16:53.380 --> 16:57.150
- We're done.
Let's go.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.152
[door opens]

16:59.219 --> 17:03.156
- 4-1-1-2,
proceed to location.

17:06.459 --> 17:10.097
- Can I talk to you a second?

17:10.130 --> 17:13.100
- Take the next one.
- Sir.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.967
[indistinct conversation]

17:15.102 --> 17:17.304
- What is it?

17:17.370 --> 17:19.639
- We had a deal.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.674
I find Geronimo,
you give me my son back.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.443
I held up my end
of the bargain.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.912
- Our deal we predicated
on Geronimo being the leader

17:25.978 --> 17:28.948
of the Resistance,
not some bullshit hipsters.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.750
You've put me in
the unenviable position--

17:30.817 --> 17:32.119
- I put you--

17:32.152 --> 17:33.686
- Of having to step in
and try and make

17:33.753 --> 17:35.488
some kind of victory
out of this steaming shit pile.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.624
- No, no--you're not moving the
goal posts back on me.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.159
- Watch your tone,
or you're gonna get a deal

17:39.226 --> 17:40.960
you really don't like.

17:44.131 --> 17:47.800
- It's my son.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.473
- Moving a person
from bloc to bloc

17:53.540 --> 17:57.043
is a whole bureaucratic process,

17:57.144 --> 17:59.146
which I am working on.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.183
In the meantime,
you need to be helping me.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.186
Now that Phyllis is dead,
you're in charge of the unit.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.720
Apparently
all the real terrorists

18:27.540 --> 18:27.774
.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.777
- Hey,
everybody listen up.

18:38.551 --> 18:42.255
I'm sure you've all heard
that Geronimo has been captured.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.990
[overlapping yes]

18:44.023 --> 18:46.393
Now, I know you're all concerned
about what we do now.

18:46.426 --> 18:50.430
Their goal was to kill our hope.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.566
So, we'll use this tragedy
as a source of strength.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.568
We'll show the Occupation
that we are undiminished.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.938
In fact, stronger.
- Yeah!

19:03.543 --> 19:05.812
- Prepare yourselves.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.948
The war is about to begin.
- Yeah!

19:11.318 --> 19:13.320
[knock at door]

19:13.353 --> 19:16.656
- You wanted to see me?

19:16.689 --> 19:19.959
- Close the door.

19:21.461 --> 19:24.130
Sit down.

19:29.636 --> 19:33.240
- Okay, here I am, sitting.

19:37.544 --> 19:40.547
- I think you're the reason
Phyllis is dead.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.316
- How's that?

19:43.350 --> 19:44.551
- Somebody's always
one step ahead of us.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.286
There's only one way
that can happen:

19:46.319 --> 19:48.321
if we've got a leak.
- You think I'm the leak.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.789
- I'm pretty sure it ain't Beau,

19:49.822 --> 19:51.057
and I'm sure as hell
it ain't me.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.660
- Are you?
You're sure as hell?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.728
Because Phyllis
had her own theory.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.163
- Which was what?

19:57.264 --> 19:58.631
- Why do you think Phyllis
had your wife

19:58.665 --> 20:00.867
come into her office alone?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.502
Why would she do that?

20:02.535 --> 20:07.340
What if you were passing
information to the Resistance

20:07.374 --> 20:08.908
without even knowing it?

20:08.941 --> 20:12.078
Being the trusting husband
that you are.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.714
I mean, if it were true,

20:14.747 --> 20:19.018
you'd be a fantastic source
of information, wouldn't you?

20:21.354 --> 20:22.755
Maybe you should
think about that

20:22.789 --> 20:26.259
before you start accusing me.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.536
[talking in next room]

20:36.569 --> 20:38.405
- Hey, guys.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.239
- Dad!

20:40.273 --> 20:42.208
- Hi.
[both laugh]

20:42.241 --> 20:44.511
- How you doing there,
little bear?

20:44.544 --> 20:46.713
- Good.
Just doing some math.

20:46.746 --> 20:50.182
- Math? That's great.
Katie home?

20:50.216 --> 20:53.753
- She went to the Yonk for a
delivery, she said, Mr. Bowman.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.455
- Can I talk to you
for a second, Lindsey?

20:55.488 --> 20:57.390
- Sure.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.364
- The day of the firebombing,

21:04.397 --> 21:05.832
did you see anything unusual?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.467
Anything at all?

21:07.500 --> 21:09.336
- No, nothing.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.604
I already told
the investigators.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.006
Mrs. Bowman asked me
to take the kids to the park,

21:14.040 --> 21:15.174
and I missed the whole thing.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.009
- Is that a normal thing?

21:17.043 --> 21:18.678
For her to ask you to
take the kids to the park?

21:18.711 --> 21:20.012
- Oh, sure.

21:20.046 --> 21:24.351
Not usually so early,
but yes.

21:24.351 --> 21:27.219
- Okay, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.971
- Not keeping you busy
at work?

21:45.004 --> 21:46.973
- [sighs]

21:47.006 --> 21:50.377
I'd rather be working here.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.212
- What's the matter, baby?

22:02.489 --> 22:06.092
- Phyllis is dead.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.495
- What?

22:08.528 --> 22:09.762
How did that happen?

22:09.796 --> 22:11.263
- Someone shot her,
and her husband,

22:11.297 --> 22:14.767
up in the Green Zone.

22:14.801 --> 22:17.770
- Jesus.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.839
- Did you say anything
about Phyllis to anybody?

22:19.872 --> 22:22.675
- No, of course not.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.514
- I was thinking maybe you
could tell me a little bit more

22:27.547 --> 22:30.917
about that conversation
between the two of you.

22:30.950 --> 22:34.721
Maybe she said something
to you that might help.

22:36.623 --> 22:39.792
- [sighs]
Um...

22:42.228 --> 22:45.432
She wanted to know
about our marriage.

22:45.432 --> 22:48.535
Our life together.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.637
I think she was
suspicious of me.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.806
- Suspicious?
How?

22:53.840 --> 22:57.143
- I think she was trying
to figure out if the bombing

22:57.176 --> 22:59.812
was related to you and me,

22:59.846 --> 23:02.181
or our relationship.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.850
- How would it be?
- I don't know.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.453
She wasn't giving up
any theories.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.457
- Just wondering
why she would think that,

23:10.490 --> 23:13.359
and how
it would be connected.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.094
- You tell me.

23:15.127 --> 23:20.767
But, it's why I was so upset
when I left her office.

23:23.470 --> 23:27.073
- Anything else you might
remember that could help?

23:28.608 --> 23:32.144
- Nothing I can think of.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.146
- All right.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.483
I gotta go back to work.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.821
Bye.

23:41.854 --> 23:45.091
- You know, drinking on the job
is gonna get you fired.

23:59.639 --> 23:59.872
.

23:59.906 --> 24:00.239
- Hello, Alan.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.710
- Hello, Helena.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.745
I've got some great news.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.179
Uh, well, I'm sure
you know it by now.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.648
We caught Geronimo.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.082
- Yes, I briefed
the Governor-General

24:10.116 --> 24:12.519
and we all heard
your radio address.

24:12.552 --> 24:15.021
- I wanted the flatlanders
to know.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.689
- Your bloc, your call.

24:16.723 --> 24:20.026
- I'm--I'm curious.
Uh, Geronimo's capture.

24:20.059 --> 24:23.229
Did you let our Hosts know?

24:23.262 --> 24:24.864
- Do they know that we have
issues with the Resistance?

24:24.897 --> 24:26.533
Of course they do.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.535
Have we told them anything
specific about Geronimo? No.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.603
The Governor-General
wants to wait and see

24:30.637 --> 24:31.904
where this is all going first.

24:31.938 --> 24:34.340
So, my question to you,
Alan, is:

24:34.373 --> 24:37.176
will Geronimo roll over
on the other terrorists or not?

24:37.209 --> 24:38.911
- Uh, actually,
as it turns out,

24:38.945 --> 24:40.379
Geronimo was
more of a figurehead

24:40.412 --> 24:44.016
than an actual terrorist.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.685
- He wasn't running
the Resistance?

24:45.718 --> 24:48.020
- No, he's a propagandist
who was using artwork

24:48.054 --> 24:50.256
to unite people
behind the Resistance.

24:50.289 --> 24:53.560
- That's unfortunate, Alan.
- Yes, and no.

24:53.560 --> 24:57.096
Some people might say
that words and images

24:57.129 --> 24:59.365
are the most powerful weapons
we have.

24:59.398 --> 25:00.733
So, I have a plan

25:00.767 --> 25:04.036
to take his power
and use it for us.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.038
- And how are you
going to do that?

25:06.072 --> 25:07.439
- Just trust me.

25:07.473 --> 25:10.476
I'm gonna turn
this into a win for us.

25:12.812 --> 25:16.182
- Okay.
I'll take your word for it.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.985
- If you want me
to go into the details, I can--

25:19.018 --> 25:21.320
- No, no, no.
You don't need my sign off.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.656
You're the captain
of your own ship, Alan.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.825
If you need our help,
let us know.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.494
Thanks for stopping by.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.737
- Hey, Gracie.

25:37.770 --> 25:40.039
I got something for you.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.609
- What is it?

25:42.609 --> 25:43.876
- Markers?

25:43.910 --> 25:45.612
Where did you get these?

25:45.612 --> 25:47.013
- From a friend.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.147
So now you can make
some more blue tigers.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.515
- [laughs]

25:49.616 --> 25:52.218
Thanks, Bram.
- Sure.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.153
- Hey.

25:54.186 --> 25:57.624
- Daddy,
look what Bram got me.

25:57.624 --> 26:01.694
- Wow, sweetie.
Markers?

26:03.362 --> 26:05.765
Where'd you get those?

26:05.798 --> 26:10.302
- I traded a friend at school
some oranges.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.876
[buzzer sounds]

26:24.116 --> 26:25.652
- All right.

26:25.652 --> 26:28.187
- Luis Ortega.

26:28.220 --> 26:31.658
Character actor extraordinaire.

26:31.658 --> 26:34.661
Pool Cue Biker in one movie.

26:34.661 --> 26:38.164
Uh...Freddie, no last name,
in another.

26:38.197 --> 26:41.868
Salesman, Thug Number Three,
Grill Chef--

26:41.901 --> 26:46.172
23 credits total,
all small stuff.

26:46.205 --> 26:49.676
How'd you like
a starring role?

26:49.676 --> 26:51.343
- Doing what?

26:51.377 --> 26:54.380
- Playing another one-name part
you've already nailed.

26:54.413 --> 26:57.784
Geronimo.

26:57.817 --> 27:01.020
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:06.258 --> 27:09.561
- Do you remember the first few
days after the Arrival?

27:09.595 --> 27:12.699
- Do I remember?

27:12.732 --> 27:14.767
I lost half my family.

27:14.801 --> 27:18.204
- So did a lot of people,

27:18.237 --> 27:20.907
until I ended that.

27:20.940 --> 27:24.944
I brought order and stability
to this bloc.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.579
But now, because of this
Geronimo bullshit,

27:27.613 --> 27:29.615
I need to prove to my bosses

27:29.716 --> 27:31.483
that my bloc is still
under control,

27:31.517 --> 27:35.521
and if I don't, it's gonna mean
more misery for all of us.

27:36.756 --> 27:42.261
So, maybe
we can help each other.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.396
- How?

27:44.430 --> 27:48.768
- You don't want
to go to the Factory, do you?

27:48.801 --> 27:50.569
Right. Exactly.

27:50.602 --> 27:53.973
So, here's what I'm proposing.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.742
I need a patsy.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.977
Someone to take the fall
in public.

27:58.010 --> 28:02.081
I need some theatrics.
That's your specialty.

28:02.114 --> 28:07.153
You play Geronimo for me
for a few days...

28:07.186 --> 28:10.089
and in turn,
I'll spare your life

28:10.122 --> 28:13.359
and get you relocated
to another colony.

28:22.902 --> 28:25.772
- Okay.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.774
- Thank you, Luis.

28:27.774 --> 28:30.542
You're gonna be a big help.

28:42.254 --> 28:42.521
.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.524
[muffled argument]

28:50.162 --> 28:52.064
[knocks on door]

28:57.904 --> 28:59.471
- Bram.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.640
- Hey, Mr. Carson.

29:01.808 --> 29:04.276
- It's an hour until curfew.
You shouldn't be here.

29:04.310 --> 29:07.413
- I know.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.049
It's just that I heard
about Geronimo

29:10.082 --> 29:11.818
and I want to help you
with your telescope.

29:11.818 --> 29:14.153
- Shh! Get it.
Get in.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.227
- This is amazing.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.294
Does it work?

29:22.328 --> 29:23.830
- No.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.331
Not unless I can find
a high-quality lens

29:25.364 --> 29:29.301
or learn how to make one.

29:29.335 --> 29:30.837
- I think I can get one for you.

29:30.837 --> 29:32.839
- You can get a telescope lens?

29:32.839 --> 29:36.408
- Yeah.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.477
- Do I even want to ask?
- No, you do not.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.179
- Hmm.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.581
I'll tell you what.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.917
You find me that lens,
and you and I

29:44.951 --> 29:49.455
are gonna figure out what those
RAPs are doing up there.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.991
Hmm?

29:56.495 --> 29:59.465
[eerie music]

29:59.498 --> 30:07.506
*

30:28.928 --> 30:36.936
*

31:30.656 --> 31:32.858
- [sighs]

31:36.996 --> 31:39.465
- You wanted to see me?

31:39.498 --> 31:42.134
- You know how that thing works?

31:42.168 --> 31:43.669
- It's a computer.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.537
It's software with
a keyboard terminal.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.506
I think I could figure it out.

31:47.539 --> 31:48.840
- Good, 'cause
we're gonna need it

31:48.874 --> 31:50.276
to run down this cell.

31:50.309 --> 31:51.978
- We?

31:52.011 --> 31:54.981
Does that mean you no longer
think I'm Mata Hari?

31:56.415 --> 31:57.816
- Want a drink?

31:57.849 --> 32:01.487
- She's got booze
stashed in there.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.590
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll have some.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.130
Thank you.

32:11.163 --> 32:14.233
- To Phyllis.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.102
- Yeah.

32:19.571 --> 32:20.872
[coughs]

32:20.906 --> 32:22.374
- Not a whiskey girl?

32:22.408 --> 32:24.710
- No, no I'm not.
Whiskey makes me drunk

32:24.743 --> 32:29.281
and, uh, yeah,
two actual drinks and I'm--

32:29.315 --> 32:32.018
- Fun?
- [laughs]

32:32.018 --> 32:33.785
Is that why you don't trust me?

32:33.819 --> 32:36.055
Because I'm not fun?

32:36.088 --> 32:38.624
- No, I didn't trust you because
the list of people I trust

32:38.657 --> 32:40.059
fits on one hand.

32:40.092 --> 32:42.128
- Yeah, I get that.

32:42.161 --> 32:45.264
[sighs]

32:45.297 --> 32:49.401
Our world now, it's all
secrets and lies.

32:49.435 --> 32:52.638
Phyllis never even told me
she had a husband.

32:54.473 --> 32:57.276
- I want to apologize.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.812
Sorry for going
after you like that.

33:00.846 --> 33:04.516
- It's all right.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.685
- I'm curious--
why did Phyllis think

33:06.718 --> 33:08.487
Katie was working
for the Resistance?

33:08.520 --> 33:11.090
- I don't know. I mean, don't
take it personally.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.758
Phyllis was good at her job
because she was

33:12.791 --> 33:14.426
suspicious of everybody.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.096
- What do you think?

33:17.129 --> 33:20.066
- I don't think that
there is a leak.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.900
Not in our unit.

33:21.933 --> 33:25.304
I think they're getting their
information from somewhere else.

33:29.075 --> 33:31.543
- You know, I don't know
anything about you.

33:31.577 --> 33:35.281
Are you married?
- Nope.

33:35.314 --> 33:37.583
This is it.

33:40.752 --> 33:44.256
I--I was supposed
to get married.

33:44.290 --> 33:47.093
The weekend after the Arrival,

33:47.093 --> 33:49.395
but it didn't work out.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.630
- What happened?

33:51.663 --> 33:53.665
- [sighs]
Um...

33:57.169 --> 33:59.738
Do you remember the first

33:59.771 --> 34:02.874
big terrorist bombing
in Westwood?

34:05.911 --> 34:09.281
My fiancé--uh, Jason,

34:09.315 --> 34:12.451
he was walking past there
when it went off.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.154
He was on his way to work
at UCLA hospital.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.489
He's a--he--

34:21.193 --> 34:24.596
He was an ER doc.

34:28.767 --> 34:31.203
You know, your life can...

34:31.237 --> 34:33.972
completely change
in an instant.

34:34.005 --> 34:36.475
It's...

34:36.508 --> 34:40.446
I never--I never really
understood that before.

34:46.585 --> 34:50.889
No one deserves to go through
what I've gone through.

35:12.711 --> 35:12.944
.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.012
- This is Hank Dawkins,
once again reporting from

35:16.348 --> 35:19.318
the trial of Luis Ortega,
better known as Geronimo.

35:19.351 --> 35:22.754
This morning was filled with
more devastating testimony

35:22.788 --> 35:25.090
from the victims of
this cold-blooded terrorist.

35:25.191 --> 35:27.058
We now go live
inside the courtroom.

35:27.092 --> 35:30.596
As always,
viewer discretion is advised.

35:37.436 --> 35:40.606
- Let's continue.

35:40.639 --> 35:43.642
Next witness, come forward.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.578
- [sniffles]

35:50.582 --> 35:53.852
My son Wesley served
with Homeland Security

35:53.885 --> 35:56.622
for the last two months.

35:56.655 --> 36:00.058
We were all so proud of him
when he took the job.

36:00.091 --> 36:04.630
He'd struggled his whole life,
and we thought,

36:04.663 --> 36:08.967
"Finally, he got it."

36:09.000 --> 36:14.139
Wesley was working security
at the Santa Monica Gateway

36:14.240 --> 36:17.276
when Geronimo's bomb exploded.

36:17.309 --> 36:20.312
[cries]

36:21.813 --> 36:24.816
[mechanical whirring]

36:27.686 --> 36:29.988
- Welcome to day six
of the Geronimo trial,

36:30.021 --> 36:34.025
where the dramatic testimony
has captivated the city.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.527
This morning,
we will be hearing

36:35.561 --> 36:38.330
from one of our
youngest colonists.

36:38.364 --> 36:42.568
- My dad just wanted to get
food for us.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.135
- What happened next?

36:44.169 --> 36:47.506
- He ran at the truck, and...

36:47.539 --> 36:49.908
Geronimo's soldiers shot him.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.978
- Why do you think
Geronimo did that?

36:53.011 --> 36:57.283
- Because he didn't want him
to get any food.

37:09.027 --> 37:11.630
- It won't be long now
before we have a verdict,

37:11.663 --> 37:13.299
and I've been hearing
the same thing

37:13.299 --> 37:15.934
from citizens
young and old, black and white:

37:15.967 --> 37:17.503
they're demanding justice.

37:17.536 --> 37:20.506
- After the Arrival,
the Transitional Authority

37:20.539 --> 37:23.309
worked very closely
with our new allies

37:23.342 --> 37:25.444
to bring about the law and order

37:25.477 --> 37:27.813
that this colony
so loudly demanded.

37:27.846 --> 37:31.817
Since then, unprecedented
peace and public safety

37:31.850 --> 37:34.586
have been realized
in Los Angeles.

37:34.620 --> 37:39.325
But, these rights
should not be assumed

37:39.325 --> 37:41.660
to be constants.

37:41.693 --> 37:45.364
The freedoms you enjoy
are not a given.

37:45.397 --> 37:48.834
They are provided at the
pleasure of our Hosts.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.803
This colony's security
is predicated on

37:51.837 --> 37:54.606
its citizens' willingness
to be active participants

37:54.640 --> 37:56.007
in its governance.

37:56.041 --> 37:58.977
Anyone--

37:59.010 --> 38:01.447
everyone
hearing these words

38:01.480 --> 38:04.716
can help to root out
the terrorists who would seek

38:04.750 --> 38:08.620
to upset the order and balance
we now enjoy.

38:08.654 --> 38:11.623
After considering all the facts
of this case,

38:11.657 --> 38:16.362
this tribunal
finds the accused...

38:16.362 --> 38:19.431
guilty.
[crowd murmuring]

38:19.465 --> 38:21.266
It is the ruling of this court

38:21.367 --> 38:24.803
that the accused
is hereby sentenced to death.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.204
[crowd murmuring]

38:26.237 --> 38:27.573
Sentence to be carried out
immediately.

38:27.606 --> 38:28.807
[gavel bangs]

38:41.286 --> 38:43.822
- Well done.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.430
- We made a deal.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.665
We made a deal!
We made a deal!

38:57.536 --> 38:58.804

38:58.837 --> 39:01.607
We made a deal!
- Hold him. Hold him.

39:01.640 --> 39:05.644
- You lied!
We made a deal!

39:05.677 --> 39:08.414
We made a deal!

40:24.355 --> 40:26.424
- Will.
Ride with me.

40:26.458 --> 40:27.726
- I just came to update you
on the case.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.495
I've got other work to do.

40:29.528 --> 40:30.996
- You can update me later.

40:31.029 --> 40:33.732
There's someone
I want you to meet.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.577

- Yes, sir.

40:45.611 --> 40:48.146

40:56.287 --> 40:58.690
- Come on.
Get in the car.

41:07.032 --> 41:08.700
- Redbird One,
good to go.

41:08.734 --> 41:11.537
- Lead One.
Roger that. Rolling out.
