WEBVTT

00:01.480 --> 00:04.677
Work's different now
I'm a resident. I feel more confident,

00:04.760 --> 00:07.354
more like a, hell,
I'll say it, a doctor.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.759
Good morning, people.

00:10.280 --> 00:14.034
- You're gonna be fine, ma'am.
- I work here.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.509
Doesn't change
the fact you're gonna be fine.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.036
Why in the hell
are you wearing a coat?

00:20.120 --> 00:21.838
Cos I'm a doctor.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.753
Babs, if you're worried
about people seeing your ass,

00:24.840 --> 00:28.310
do what all the other girls do
and tie a sweater around your waist.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.594
I look doctorly.

00:29.680 --> 00:33.150
You look like the guy who buys
a bronze star, pins it to his lapel

00:33.240 --> 00:38.314
and tells everyone to call him Sarge.
Nobody likes that guy. Not a soul.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.798
- I was in the military.
- Where did you come from?

00:42.880 --> 00:46.077
If I find out you're wearing a bronzy
without having served,

00:46.160 --> 00:48.355
I'll make things
uncomfortable for you.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.749
Coat-wearing doctors
do not take this crap.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.673
- You were never in the military.
- Yes, I was.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.469
- Which branch?
- The janitor branch.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.959
I'm watching you.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.191
That's right, Sasquatch.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.714
You see, things have changed.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.958
We've begun to adapt to new situations.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.393
My back is on fire.

01:09.480 --> 01:13.473
If Dr Amato was any shorter, I'd be
passing him instruments with my feet.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.471
Dr Turk, I need you down here.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.152
Coming down.

01:18.240 --> 01:21.357
Even other people
are starting to see us differently.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.510
Hey there, Doctor.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.160
Oh, me? Of course,
because I'm a doctor.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.832
I've got the outfit.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.912
I've got the heart-hearing thingy.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.195
Stethoscope.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.317
Paging Dr Know-it-all to the cafeteria.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.991
Oh, sweet baby James.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.629
Most importantly, we've started
to treat each other with respect.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.472
Dude, you're such a loser, man.

01:48.560 --> 01:51.677
I look spiffy. I'm trying
to separate myself from the pack.

01:51.760 --> 01:55.116
You already have. You're the biggest
geek to come through here.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.599
- Yeah.
- Don't laugh.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.513
- You're a frat boy with a back problem.
- Yeah, I am.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.272
Oh, do me, do me, do me!

02:01.360 --> 02:03.999
Be careful about yelling
that out in a bar.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.672
You guys get to be something.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.911
The Dork, Jock, firecracker
from the School of Hard Knocks.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.833
No offence, Carla. Damn it, what am l?

02:11.920 --> 02:13.990
- You're white.
- The whitest.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.992
- Yeah, you are.
- Oh, come on. JD's white.

02:17.080 --> 02:21.073
I ain't hearing that woman
cos I'm talking to him.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.191
OK, it's a tie.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.391
T-Diddy?

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:41.040 --> 02:43.315
You got me in the lCU for a cold?

02:43.400 --> 02:46.710
Mr Blair, you have a sinus infection
with orbital extension.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.190
You were admitted delirious
from your 1 06-degree temperature,

02:50.280 --> 02:52.919
naked and very adamant
about staying that way.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.639
- I was hot.
- I'll second that.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.838
- Sharp coat, sport.
- Yeah, it's spiffy.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.673
Shocker! You care more
about appearances...

03:03.760 --> 03:06.911
Finish that thought quickly.
I'm not breaking my gait.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.912
...substance, style,
what's important, coat, not...

03:10.000 --> 03:13.754
- Too slow.
- I think you really got through to him.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.318
My God, you hear like a bat.

03:18.880 --> 03:23.317
Idiot. I wish I had a guy that would
stop me before I did something stupid.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.515
Mistake!

03:34.000 --> 03:35.991
I don't know why he's an opera singer.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.992
Listen, Tiny Dancer,
I wouldn't be flapping my mouth

03:39.080 --> 03:41.753
if I'd forgotten
to get a blood culture on Mr Blair.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.469
And for the love of God, do you at least
remember what you were doing

03:45.560 --> 03:47.869
the day they were passing out
common sense?

03:47.960 --> 03:49.552
Maybe you were running late

03:49.640 --> 03:54.077
cos you couldn't find the right thong
for those low-rider jeans you love.

03:54.160 --> 03:58.711
Maybe you were bopping along to
whatever boy band makes your heart race

03:58.800 --> 04:01.951
and you just drove on by.
I don't know, I'm just guessing.

04:02.040 --> 04:05.237
But one thing's sure.
You wound up at the dumb-dumb store

04:05.320 --> 04:09.313
and put about as much of that
in the car as you could fit, didn't you?

04:09.400 --> 04:12.790
And then I did something
I've never done before.

04:12.880 --> 04:16.793
If you flipped the page you'd see
that I pan cultured him yesterday,

04:16.880 --> 04:20.952
but that would spoil the pleasure you
take in pointing out people's slip-ups.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.235
Too bad, Buster Brown,
I'm a resident now,

04:23.320 --> 04:26.630
I'm not gonna make the same
intern mistakes I made last year.

04:26.720 --> 04:30.076
I'd appreciate if you wouldn't
yell at me in front of my patient.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.513
Buster Brown?

04:31.600 --> 04:35.639
Focus all energy on lip not quivering.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.399
- How's the back, sweetness?
- Perfect.

04:41.480 --> 04:45.917
I'm sorry the last couple of nights
I haven't given you the Turkey-Jerky,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.595
but rest assured your man will be back
in action before you know it.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.113
You take your time.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.398
Hey, big fella, we're together
on a thyroidectomy this afternoon.

04:57.480 --> 05:00.517
- Could be a long one.
- Oh, that's great, Dr Amato.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.994
- How was that not funny?
- I don't know, dude.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.674
You guys are getting to be
like Starsky and Hutch.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.593
If Starsky was a ventriloquist
and Hutch was a puppet.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.319
I would watch that.
Why do you keep getting him?

05:17.400 --> 05:21.075
The other surgeons are busting my chops
for skipping guys' night out.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.752
Dr Amato's your punishment?

05:22.840 --> 05:26.116
No, I enjoy needing you to lower me
on the toilet in the morning.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.189
Check that out.

05:27.280 --> 05:30.078
It looks innocent,
but Elliot was late this morning.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.755
Once you've been here a while,
you learn to read between the lines.

05:44.360 --> 05:47.432
Mrs Bumbry, I wish I had better news,
but you didn't qualify

05:47.520 --> 05:50.637
for the Gl clinical trials,
so we'll keep plugging away.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.234
Great. So how was the sex with that guy?

05:53.320 --> 05:54.753
What guy? I wasn't... I...

05:54.840 --> 05:58.799
Elliot, I have other patients, Mrs
Bumbry needs a nap. We're all very busy.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.599
I've never done anything like this.
I just met him and slept with him.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.398
God, I miss one-night stands.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.278
The best thing was,
since I knew it was just a fling,

06:09.360 --> 06:12.318
I wasn't afraid to ask him
for exactly what I wanted.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.109
- Which was?
- Shirt on, lights off, no talking.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.033
Well, you just be careful.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.796
You wouldn't believe how quickly a
reputation can be made in this hospital.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.871
You're a bit of slut, aren't you?

06:34.040 --> 06:36.270
As soon as we get out
of this sterile field,

06:36.360 --> 06:40.956
I am going to need the man
who hit that to hit that.

06:58.720 --> 07:01.439
Wait a minute, I'm Elliot Reid.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.149
People, listen up,
this rumour ends right now.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.834
She slept with him
and she hardly knew him.

07:07.920 --> 07:11.549
- Does that happen a lot around here?
- Not enough.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.156
That infection keeps hanging around,

07:14.240 --> 07:17.915
so I want to put you on a broader-
spectrum antibiotic intravenously.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.399
But I'm feeling better.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.996
I'm gonna tell you something my mom
used to tell me when I was scared.

07:24.080 --> 07:27.436
In the case of sinus infection
not responding to antibiotics,

07:27.520 --> 07:32.310
the recommended protocol
is imipenem, 500 mg, lVQ, six hours.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.437
Got me through a lot of hard times.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.272
I love it that Mr Blair trusted me.

07:37.360 --> 07:40.716
It's one of the best feelings
you can have as a doctor.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.314
- How's it going?
- You can't wear that.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.790
- You mean after Labour Day?
- You know what I mean.

07:46.880 --> 07:50.156
It's a white coat.
Anybody can wear a white coat.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.156
Jerk.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.470
You're what we call "a goner."

07:56.400 --> 07:58.311
I'm kidding. There's nothing here.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.511
So Mrs Bumbry here
has inflammatory bowel disease, huh?

08:03.600 --> 08:06.910
And the drug they're testing
at the clinical trial could help.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.753
But she doesn't qualify.
You OK, Mrs Bumbry?

08:09.880 --> 08:11.950
I liked Bow Wow
when he was Lil' Bow Wow.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.110
Rappers, they grow up so fast.

08:14.200 --> 08:19.399
If you're gonna survive in medicine,
you've gotta accept rules are rules.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.596
Anyone from that
clinical trial around?

08:21.680 --> 08:26.231
Hello! Hello! This lady's
supposed to be in this trial.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.709
- OK.
- What the hell did you just do?

08:28.800 --> 08:32.554
When you speak of this, and
I know you will, could I be shirtless?

08:32.640 --> 08:36.349
I think it would be even more
impressive if I was shirtless.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.517
If you're a criminal,
even if you aren't afraid of Starsky,

08:41.600 --> 08:45.673
if a Hutch puppet jumps out at you,
"Freeze, sucker!" you're done for.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.637
Does it have a real gun or puppet gun?

08:47.720 --> 08:51.998
- Puppet gun. They'd sew it to his hand.
- OK. I'd watch that.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.035
What's up, fellas?

08:56.120 --> 09:01.353
I don't care what hospital you go to,
surgery is still a boys' club.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.110
I'm just as cool as those guys.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.115
Bye, Turk.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.509
T -Dog, settle a medical debate for us.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.239
I think Elliot's
got a modest rack at best.

09:15.320 --> 09:20.348
But my favourite attending here
says when he was tuning in Tokyo,

09:20.440 --> 09:22.510
the reception was excellent.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.876
Elliot's a friend of mine,
so I don't want to talk about that.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.758
So, Dr Turk, how is your back?

09:31.160 --> 09:33.993
My back's as swollen
as Elliot's big-ass breasts.

09:39.880 --> 09:44.112
- I was paged.
- Patient's complaining of anosmia.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.156
Anosmia?

09:46.240 --> 09:49.915
I always thought it was very funny
that losing your sense of smell

09:50.000 --> 09:52.719
was called anosmia.

09:52.800 --> 09:57.555
Anosmia, you know, like Schnozmia.
Don't you find that very funny?

10:00.320 --> 10:02.311
- He doesn't.
- I'm calling Dr Cox.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.756
- Nobody needs to call Dr Cox.
- This is only temporary, right?

10:05.840 --> 10:10.630
Of course it's temporary.
Could also be slightly more untemporary.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.631
You mean permanent.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.993
Just when you think
you have this place figured out,

10:16.080 --> 10:17.672
it finds a new way to get you.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.637
I'm waiting.

10:21.040 --> 10:25.431
Unfortunately, you've
put us in somewhat of a legal bind.

10:25.520 --> 10:29.672
Way to go, T ed. Good God, man,
you couldn't scare a child.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.478
Who would want to?

10:31.560 --> 10:36.076
Do you have any idea how much money
this hospital makes from that Gl trial

10:36.160 --> 10:38.628
into which you enrolled your patient?

10:38.720 --> 10:41.393
I'm gonna go ahead and guess $7.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.311
Sometimes it comes right at you.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.960
Keep smiling, tough guy.
First I'm gonna...

10:46.040 --> 10:50.352
Finish that thought, Bobcat,
cos I'm not breaking my gait.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.914
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.229
Sometimes it sneaks up on you.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.471
When she dated JD, she'd just wear
a T-shirt in the morning.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.233
So every time
she reached up high for the cereal,

11:04.320 --> 11:06.629
everybody got two scoops
of booty flakes.

11:06.720 --> 11:10.952
The two scoops, they were packed
with flavour. You know what I'm saying?

11:11.040 --> 11:13.235
Right? Right? Right?

11:18.720 --> 11:21.029
I told you I didn't want
these antibiotics.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.476
When your first grandkid
is born and you smell his head,

11:24.560 --> 11:26.312
call me and tell me how great it is.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.277
Mr Blair, I'm sorry this happened.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.989
Sometimes it hits you in places you
didn't know you were vulnerable.

11:32.080 --> 11:35.709
Yeah, well you should be,
it's your fault.

11:35.800 --> 11:40.351
No more silly medical mistakes, huh?
Nice going there, Newbie.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.908
Damn.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.835
Ted, you seem different.

11:49.840 --> 11:54.675
I bought some relaxation tapes.
They're working.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.230
A patient's blaming me
for losing his sense of smell.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.959
God, you cut off someone's nose?

12:01.040 --> 12:04.271
Where is it? Do you have it on you?
You're disgusting.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.157
No, I just gave him lV imipenem.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.959
Kelso's gonna blame me.
Just get rid of the nose.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.634
I don't have the nose.
Maybe you should calm down.

12:11.720 --> 12:15.838
- Maybe you should calm down!
- My bad.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.078
Imipenem.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.910
"Unlike gentamicin and tetracycline,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.549
imipenem has never been
associated with anosmia."

12:31.040 --> 12:33.395
My God, we're OK.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.233
Great. Thank you, Ted.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.276
- It's my birthday.
- What?

12:38.360 --> 12:39.429
Nothing.

12:41.520 --> 12:44.114
And many more...

12:44.200 --> 12:45.713
Elliot!

12:45.800 --> 12:49.952
Come on. It's so tough to be a surgeon.
If you're not in, you're out.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.589
Dr Turk. Down here.

12:54.280 --> 12:58.068
I saw you switched off on our
exploratory laparotomy this afternoon.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.196
Yeah, it's because l... I had to...

13:00.280 --> 13:03.238
- It's because I'm short.
- You're not short.

13:03.320 --> 13:06.118
I know I'm the surgical
assignment booby prize,

13:06.200 --> 13:08.839
but if my other choice
is being in that boys' club,

13:08.920 --> 13:10.512
I'd rather they made fun of me.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.512
- What could they possibly make fun...
- Stop it.

13:13.600 --> 13:17.434
It's possible to be a good surgeon
without playing their game.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.751
- You're really short.
- I know.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.957
No, Dr Murray, I don't want
any fries to go with this shake.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.234
- I don't even know what that means.
- Excuse me.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.153
You want to ask me how many
ceiling tiles I've counted?

13:32.240 --> 13:35.312
Maybe you want to call me a name
like tramp, ho or slesident,

13:35.400 --> 13:37.231
which is half slut, half resident.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.117
- No.
- Then what is it, Noelle?

13:39.200 --> 13:41.873
- I want to know where the G-spot is.
- The what spot?

13:41.960 --> 13:44.599
For the 1 00th time,
you had nothing to do

13:44.680 --> 13:48.309
with me getting involved in the Bumbry
case, but for God's sake,

13:48.400 --> 13:50.197
the bigger problem facing us now

13:50.280 --> 13:52.555
is how do we get you
to stop annoying me?

13:52.640 --> 13:56.599
Yeah, I'm the problem. Can't you
just for once stay out of your own way?

13:56.680 --> 13:59.956
Can't you for once
not be such a busybody?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.076
Oh, sore spot.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.435
- What spot?
- Sore spot.

14:04.520 --> 14:05.714
Damn it!

14:06.480 --> 14:10.712
The next step is to find out what
did cause Mr Blair's loss of smell.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.234
- Hey, pal.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.153
Oh, no, I'm not a doctor. I'm a janitor.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.515
Oh. I just assumed because of the coat.

14:19.600 --> 14:23.115
Right. Well, janitors wear
white coats around here too.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.714
You guys do a great job
keeping this place clean.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.950
- We thank you.
- No, I'm a doctor...

14:28.040 --> 14:30.508
Look at the books, woman.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.392
Is that a man's back?

14:34.480 --> 14:37.756
Check out who I have assisting
Dr Rumpelsurgeon.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.275
You know what?
His name's Dr Amato.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.715
That girl you slept with,
her name's Dr Reid.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.594
- You should show them some respect.
- Yeah? Says who?

14:51.880 --> 14:53.472
Says me.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.354
- Dr Kelso.
- Carla.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.556
You look as good as I feel.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.870
Mrs Bumbry's 53.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.359
Mrs who is what?

15:06.440 --> 15:09.034
The patient Dr Cox
got into the Gl clinical trial.

15:09.120 --> 15:13.079
She was disqualified because her chart
said she was 63 and the cut-off is 55,

15:13.160 --> 15:15.833
but the genius who admitted her
got her age wrong.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.354
She's actually a perfect candidate.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.670
And Dr Cox knew this?

15:20.760 --> 15:24.355
- He knew the whole time.
- Fan-damn-tastic.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.110
You better do the heel-toe out of here

15:27.200 --> 15:30.351
because you know I'm going
to take this out on somebody.

15:30.440 --> 15:31.839
Bye-bye.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.797
May I join you?

15:38.160 --> 15:39.479
By all means.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.834
Knowing I was right and he was wrong,
I thought I'd enjoy this walk more.

15:43.920 --> 15:47.515
I couldn't help but empathise
cos I'd been there and saw the signs.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.319
The shameful averted gaze.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.311
The nervous shifting.

15:52.400 --> 15:56.678
And, of course,
the wild, uncontrollable urination.

16:02.680 --> 16:08.915
I'm thrilled you approve, but, for the
last time, I'm up here. I'm up here.

16:10.680 --> 16:13.274
- You were wrong. I was right.
- I beg your pardon?

16:13.360 --> 16:15.920
Anosmia isn't a side-effect
of lV imipenem.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.958
Plus, Mr Blair had nasal
polypectomies and septoplasty

16:19.040 --> 16:22.316
and his loss of smell is caused
by manipulation of his sinuses

16:22.400 --> 16:24.914
and the infection,
so I didn't make a mistake,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.912
and you were wrong
when you said, "Nice going, Newbie."

16:28.000 --> 16:30.195
Here you've put me in a tough situation.

16:30.280 --> 16:34.353
I can't honestly decide
whether to say "duh" or "doy"

16:34.440 --> 16:38.035
or a very sarcastic,
"Oh, really?" My God, Fiona.

16:38.120 --> 16:41.078
I know it wasn't your fault.
The patient probably knows.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.071
But he seemed a little distraught.

16:43.160 --> 16:47.119
Maybe being able to blame somebody
for a second might make him feel better.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.715
And, I know, maybe it's me,
but doesn't that seem like something

16:50.800 --> 16:53.598
that goes along
with wearing that fancy white coat?

16:53.680 --> 16:56.558
It does, doesn't it?

16:58.320 --> 17:01.312
- Kinda.
- I'm so proud of you. Put it there.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.310
The tarantula.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.757
That girl asked me to give her
my top ten sexual positions,

17:11.839 --> 17:14.752
and after the two that I knew,
I started naming insects.

17:14.839 --> 17:16.717
That really sucks. I'm sorry.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.155
I'm not sure. I mean,
I was mad at you at first.

17:19.240 --> 17:24.553
But it's actually kind of empowering
to have this... persona, this identity.

17:24.640 --> 17:28.394
I'm not just some nameless,
faceless white doctor,

17:28.480 --> 17:31.313
I'm Elliot Reid, Tramp.

17:32.720 --> 17:36.190
Well, that's great.
If you're happy, I'm happy.

17:36.280 --> 17:40.114
The weird thing is she said
she'd already tried stink bug.

17:43.400 --> 17:47.552
I still don't know why I was desperate
for everyone to know it wasn't my fault.

17:47.640 --> 17:51.599
Dr Cox, Dr Kelso
has something he wants to say to you.

17:51.680 --> 17:56.356
So I hear there was an age mix-up,
that I was unaware of,

17:56.440 --> 17:59.159
and... anyway...

18:00.200 --> 18:03.237
- You're OK.
- I'm sorry.

18:03.320 --> 18:06.471
I guess it comes down to how
we want to be seen by other people.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.318
I proud of you, Robert.
Put her there.

18:12.840 --> 18:16.913
I think it's important you understand
I had no idea how old that patient was.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.118
For the record, she could've been 1 70,
I still would've stuck her in that trial

18:21.200 --> 18:23.953
so fast it'd make your teeth
fall out all over again.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.235
- That's perfect.
- I would too.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.709
Some people want to be seen
as the rebel.

18:32.280 --> 18:35.238
Some people just want
to be seen, period.

18:37.440 --> 18:41.115
Some people have limits on how far
they'll go to protect their image.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.556
- Dr T urk, I need you down here.
- Coming.

18:45.720 --> 18:50.475
When I stopped worrying how other
people saw me I started to look better.

18:50.560 --> 18:55.509
Mr Blair, I just wanted to say again
that I made a mistake and I'm sorry.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.910
- It's all right.
- Good luck.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.515
Come on, baby.
Let's see if we can find you a ride.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.591
Laverne!

19:05.720 --> 19:07.995
Careful.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.868
So we're done with the coats?
It was a fun day, though, wasn't it?

19:11.960 --> 19:13.313
See you tomorrow.

19:14.880 --> 19:18.475
Maybe tomorrow I'll get a bad haircut
and push round a mop all day.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.995
I know. You don't have to do it, OK?

19:26.080 --> 19:30.312
Mistake!

19:37.240 --> 19:39.037
Yeah.
