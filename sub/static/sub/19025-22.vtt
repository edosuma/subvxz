00:04.440 --> 00:07.398
<i>I convinced Elliot to dump her</i>
<i>boyfriend and be with me,</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.198
<i>then told her I didn't love her.</i>

00:09.280 --> 00:13.478
<i>Still, we're good friends, so if I give</i>
<i>her some space, everything will be fine.</i>

00:13.560 --> 00:18.475
<i>Since Turk's family's in town for his</i>
<i>wedding, I'm staying at her apartment.</i>

00:18.560 --> 00:20.471
We have to go.

00:21.680 --> 00:24.513
My lips are bleeding.
Can you hand me a tissue?

00:25.880 --> 00:27.996
What do you think?
Extra groomsman?

00:30.680 --> 00:33.513
Don't worry, Rowdy.
I'm marrying their sister.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.275
Baby, check this out. You ain't
gonna believe what I did with Rowdy.

00:37.360 --> 00:41.069
You're not allowed to see me
on our wedding day, you idiot.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.913
- She's mulling it over.
- I just figured it out.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.639
It's a reality show
where our sister convinces us

00:46.720 --> 00:49.712
she's gonna marry some obnoxious...

00:49.800 --> 00:53.349
We haven't really had a chance
to talk yet. I'm Mama Turk.

00:53.440 --> 00:57.513
- How you doing?
- Damn, that looks painful.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.556
I want you guys to get along today.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.676
I hope you die.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.876
- After the wedding.
- Thank you.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.030
- Help me wax my brow.
- Okey-dokey.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.111
I do.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.668
And then it's classy kiss

01:11.760 --> 01:13.671
or sexy kiss

01:14.880 --> 01:16.791
or slu <i>tty</i> kiss.

01:18.480 --> 01:22.029
- That looks like fun. Can I help?
- Help this.

01:22.120 --> 01:24.031
Maybe you should pay attention.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.599
Really?

01:28.640 --> 01:30.710
How thin did you want those?

01:35.680 --> 01:37.511
Turk and I have to go.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.319
<i>Turk and I had made a pact.</i>

01:40.400 --> 01:44.154
<i>The day one of us got married we'd play</i>
<i>a last round of tennis-ball golf</i>

01:44.240 --> 01:46.470
<i>as single best friends.</i>

01:46.560 --> 01:48.835
- Look out, Tiger.
- That'll play.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.319
Hell, yeah.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.790
<i>And the guy getting married</i>
<i>has to caddy for the other guy, naked.</i>

01:56.800 --> 02:01.555
He'll be fine. I can't believe
you're actually getting married.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.278
Me neither, buddy.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.510
Where's the fuzzy cover
for my one wood?

02:05.600 --> 02:09.832
- It's on my nine wood.
- Dude, my mom made that.

02:09.919 --> 02:12.070
Still, I'm happy for you man.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.071
Me too.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.640 --> 02:33.757
Great. I think I'm getting a pimple.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.153
Is this noticeable?

02:38.240 --> 02:40.435
I'll ask someone else.

02:40.520 --> 02:44.798
- Hide the bride. I found him.
- We're heading over to St John's.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.599
- Not Holy Trinity?
- St John's is cheaper.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.911
- The priest looks like Captain Sulu.
- That's at Trinity.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.879
- I wanted to be married by Sulu.
- Are you coming now or not?

02:54.960 --> 02:57.997
If I work, I can finagle
two extra days on the honeymoon.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.310
- Nice use of finagle.
- Thanks.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.755
I get out at four.
The ceremony's at five.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.195
Worst-case scenario, I'm a little late.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.555
Do it.

03:07.640 --> 03:10.279
Dude, there's a nervous bride,
a woman I scorned,

03:10.360 --> 03:12.316
and two sisters with three eyebrows.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.119
See you at five.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.632
How are you doing
with this whole JD thing?

03:20.640 --> 03:24.599
I can't believe that on this day
you would worry about how I'm doing.

03:24.680 --> 03:27.478
- You're such an amazing friend.
- Don't do this.

03:27.560 --> 03:31.439
I promised I wouldn't get emotional
until after we took the pictures.

03:31.520 --> 03:35.195
- I just love you so much.
- I love you, too.

03:36.280 --> 03:39.670
Even though I ripped off
your sister's eyebrow?

03:39.760 --> 03:43.309
This morning she actually said
she was gonna look better than me.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.311
Not anymore.

03:48.440 --> 03:51.477
There is a man filming us.

03:51.560 --> 03:54.313
He's just doing our wedding video.
Hi, Anthony.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.118
What's up?

03:56.200 --> 03:59.317
Oh, my God. You're actually
getting married in a few hours.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.834
Everything's gonna be so different.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.878
You never have to have sex again
except when you want to.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.871
I know.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.395
Erase that last part.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.395
So, are you ready for your appendectomy?

04:15.480 --> 04:17.869
What do you do
with an appendix afterwards?

04:17.959 --> 04:21.077
- We make finger puppets.
- Don't mind Dr Turk here.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.879
He's excited
because he's getting married today.

04:23.960 --> 04:28.317
I, on the other hand, am the only person
in the hospital not to be invited.

04:28.400 --> 04:33.872
It's a really small wedding, and you're
an amazing boss and I feel bad about it.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.349
There's a wedding brunch tomorrow.

04:36.440 --> 04:41.560
It's only for family and close friends,
and we'd love for you to be there.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.108
That would mean the world to me.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.670
I didn't think you were gonna say yes.
There's no brunch.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.830
That's gonna cost me.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.028
Jordan, get out of bed.
We got a wedding to go to.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.556
Perry, Jack is at my mom's.

04:57.640 --> 05:02.589
The apartment is empty.
It's just you and me.

05:03.240 --> 05:06.630
Let's sleep through the ceremony
and then go to the reception.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.756
Can we at least have sex?

05:08.840 --> 05:11.957
Do what you have to. Don't wake me.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.909
- Ted. Church.
- We do mostly Bar Mitzvahs.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.911
- Hey, JZ.
- Holla.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.594
For some reason
this woman wants you to usher her.

05:28.680 --> 05:32.116
- What are you doing here?
- We RSVP'd when we were dating.

05:32.200 --> 05:35.670
- You can't crash my friend's wedding.
- I'll go halfsies on a gift.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.035
Right this way, please.

05:39.960 --> 05:44.636
Dude, that pickup line you gave me for
all the Spanish chicks is not working.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.792
Maybe you're saying it wrong.
Let's hear it.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.150
That's right. Keep trying.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.952
I agree with Chet.
Turk, Carla, you guys are awesome.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.032
This is an awesome wedding
and I'm having an awesome time

06:05.120 --> 06:07.998
and you two are gonna have
an awesome life.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.150
- Awesome.
- Hold my gum.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.793
Give me that appendix. Let's close
this guy up and I'm outta here.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.440
Wait. Look at those lesions
on his peritoneum.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.633
What do you think we should do?

06:25.720 --> 06:28.518
- Leave a Post-it for the next guy?
- Try again.

06:28.600 --> 06:32.718
Perform an exploratory laparotomy.
I need a phone.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.678
Everybody, we're gonna get started soon,

06:35.760 --> 06:38.832
so if everyone could please
turn off your cellphones.

06:45.080 --> 06:49.596
Go for the Todd. Turk, I can't talk
right now. I'm at your wedding.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.636
Give me that.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.190
Carla, it's Turk.

06:57.920 --> 07:01.754
- Where are the other bridesmaids?
- They're out buying an eyebrow.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.877
On Saturday, with Eyebrows,
Eyebrows, Eyebrows closed?

07:04.960 --> 07:07.872
They're gonna have to go
across town to the Eyebrow Hut.

07:09.640 --> 07:12.074
Just tell me what you want me to do.

07:12.160 --> 07:16.472
Go back three days and keep me
from throwing away my life for you.

07:17.240 --> 07:20.596
<i>That second I knew how to make things</i>
<i>right if I just had the time.</i>

07:20.680 --> 07:24.070
- You're gonna be late?
- Sweet.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.993
- What did you say?
- Nothing, girl.

07:28.480 --> 07:31.119
- Wedding wishes?
- Hey, kids.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.476
I just wanna wish you two
all the luck in the world.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.358
The key to marriage is...

07:37.440 --> 07:40.000
Look.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.637
- Ted, do I look ready?
- Sorry.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.553
Everybody sit down. Cover your eyes.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.990
Turk got held up in surgery,

07:53.080 --> 07:56.914
but if you just hold on for a few
minutes, everything will be perfect.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.276
Don't look. I'll be back in a minute.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.238
I knew that jackass would screw this up.

08:03.320 --> 08:06.676
- Did you dis my friend Turk?
- What are you gonna do, meathead?

08:06.760 --> 08:10.196
My friend, I'm about to make you
look very silly.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.591
Things are starting to heat up.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.671
<i>I wonder how Sean took it</i>
<i>when Elliot dumped him.</i>

08:20.480 --> 08:22.948
<i>You wouldn't know</i>
<i>if Sean Kelley lives here?</i>

08:23.040 --> 08:25.395
Hey, JD.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.634
Thanks for the buck.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.509
Honey, are you waking up?

08:36.600 --> 08:40.479
- Why are you in such a hurry?
- I'm not in any kind of hurry.

08:44.800 --> 08:48.588
- Did you dress me?
- Fine. Carla scares me.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.478
She may be small,
but she has very powerful legs.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.471
When we get to the reception,

08:53.560 --> 08:57.553
you will just say what a beautiful
ceremony it was and it will be peachy.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.915
Trust me, we're not missing anything.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.037
Hey, babe, got any wedding wishes?

09:04.160 --> 09:06.674
This is a great wedding.
I'm having so much fun.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.877
There's a lot of cute boys here.
I'm just having so much fun.

09:09.960 --> 09:14.317
These guys kiss really good.
And I like everyone's clothes.

09:14.400 --> 09:19.428
Me and your roommate didn't really
work out, but we're still friends.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.239
- Ted, I will kill you.
- Won't happen again.

09:27.320 --> 09:30.392
You know the drill, people.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.914
There's another wedding scheduled.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.389
Don't go there, Padre. He'll be here.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.474
- Please.
- Go. I can finish from here.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.278
Thank you.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.515
So, Sean, you look woolly.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.989
Since Elliot left me,
my life's fallen apart.

09:52.080 --> 09:56.392
It's been four days, which, by the way,
makes the beard all the more impressive.

09:56.480 --> 09:59.153
I'm a quarter Hungarian.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.959
- What do you want?
- I didn't steal Elliot from you.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.395
She just panicked cos
you were moving in.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.629
I don't know.

10:05.720 --> 10:09.076
If you have any guts at all,
you will show up at this wedding,

10:09.160 --> 10:15.235
take her into your hairy arms
and tell her you want her back.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.675
You should probably shower first.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.270
I can't believe he's not here yet.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.237
Don't worry. I made it.

10:23.320 --> 10:26.630
- I don't care about you, you idiot.
- They had pre-marital sex.

10:26.720 --> 10:30.076
Miss Espinosa, if your fiancé
is not here in the next 30 seconds,

10:30.200 --> 10:32.031
I'm gonna have to pull the plug.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.429
- Do you ever miss the ladies?
- A little.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.589
I would too.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.470
- <i>Are you close yet?</i>
- I'm here.

10:39.560 --> 10:42.358
Start it up,
and I'll meet you at the altar.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.711
It's for real this time, people.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.070
Can I help you, young man?

11:18.160 --> 11:20.276
Mr Sulu?

11:20.360 --> 11:22.271
No, son.

11:24.520 --> 11:28.672
Hey, baby. I got mixed up. Is there
still time if I race over there?

11:28.760 --> 11:30.671
No.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.476
Hey, baby. How's the party?

11:47.760 --> 11:51.196
I'll just stand here
and be quiet for a little while.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.431
- Just a club soda, I'm driving.
- It's an open bar, cutie.

11:54.520 --> 11:59.514
Give me a bucket of Scotch.
Sport, take these and keep moving.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.437
<i>There she is.</i>
<i>Do something charming.</i>

12:04.040 --> 12:06.270
Check it out.
Kelso gave me his car keys.

12:08.240 --> 12:11.755
- What are you doing?
- Thinking of ways to make things right.

12:11.840 --> 12:17.073
You can cross off "Keys in the face."
Honestly, there's nothing you can do.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.079
Hey, Elliot.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.716
I'm sorry. I get excited.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.918
What do you mean, disaster?
This is an amazing wedding.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.597
I know we didn't actually get married,
but tonight we're gonna rip it up.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.636
Then we hop on a plane to the Bahamas,

12:39.720 --> 12:43.793
where you and I can get married tomorrow
amongst the fishes and mermaids.

12:43.880 --> 12:47.873
- Mermaids aren't real.
- I know what I saw.

12:47.960 --> 12:52.158
- Why isn't the band playing?
- In a word, shrimps.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.595
Nasty one-day-old shrimp.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.593
The band got into them while
we was waiting for your sorry ass.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.069
Girl, you are wearing that dress.

13:02.280 --> 13:06.478
No music. I swear,
I am this close to losing it.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.635
- Carla.
- It's OK.

13:09.720 --> 13:14.157
That was one of the most beautiful
ceremonies that I've ever seen.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.470
- Boy.
- You think that's funny?

13:16.560 --> 13:19.313
Why would you wanna hurt me?

13:20.680 --> 13:22.591
Shame on you.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.628
So, open bar?

13:28.600 --> 13:30.989
Get out while you can.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.991
I'm happy.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.028
- Happy wedding, nerd.
- Keep walking, dragon.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.672
- How's it going?
- You wore your uniform to a wedding?

13:44.760 --> 13:48.594
I wasn't invited to the wedding.
I just work here on weekends.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.268
- Who's that?
- My date.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.590
Forks. Franny, forks.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.879
- Are forks where the big money is?
- Forks and ladles.

13:59.960 --> 14:03.919
- So, what have you been up to?
- Doctor stuff. You?

14:04.000 --> 14:08.471
I was crying a lot and then
I got really emotionally numb.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.120
And I jammed a salad fork
two inches into my thigh

14:11.200 --> 14:13.953
- to see if I could still feel the pain.
- And?

14:14.040 --> 14:15.678
- Yeah.
- Good.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.955
Do you wanna get out of here?

14:18.040 --> 14:20.429
I don't know what JD told you,

14:20.520 --> 14:24.308
but if we're gonna give this
another try, you need to know

14:24.400 --> 14:28.473
I didn't end things because I was
freaking out about us living together.

14:28.560 --> 14:33.429
JD and I have this history, and
I actually thought he might be the one.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.830
But I just ended up
getting my heart broken.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.790
It sucks, doesn't it?

14:44.360 --> 14:50.674
Carla. I apologise. I am a horse's ass.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.391
It's not you. It's everything.

14:57.040 --> 15:01.113
Ever since I was little, I had this
fairy-tale idea of the perfect wedding.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.316
And I always ended up married.

15:03.400 --> 15:08.872
Marriage is overrated. Jordan and I
aren't married and we get along great.

15:08.960 --> 15:12.669
Per? Is making out
with a stranger cheating?

15:12.760 --> 15:15.399
Technically,
not if it's under ten seconds, dear.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.914
Not worth it.

15:19.280 --> 15:24.434
Look, you and Turk were meant to be
together. It's fate, and you know it.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.111
Thank you.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.275
- I shouldn't be drinking.
- I know.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.630
Carla's dying. It's rally time.
We have no band, no deejay.

15:48.720 --> 15:51.280
You're my best man. Brainstorm.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.640
Remember that party
when the stereo went out

15:54.720 --> 15:57.598
and I hooked up
with that grad student from Brazil?

15:57.680 --> 16:01.639
- That was awesome.
- You made out with a little person.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.915
I thought she was kneeling. Ted.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.433
Can you play
a little music for us, buddy?

16:07.520 --> 16:10.114
It'll cost double
what you paid us for the church.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.679
Here's 20.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.194
And here's four back.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.557
So, mind if we start with some Tupac?

16:18.640 --> 16:21.518
- Kick it.
- All right.

16:25.400 --> 16:29.439
So, call me if you ever wanna
get drunk and have sex.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.271
Bye, Sean.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.833
- Can I have a ride home?
- Well, sure.

16:41.640 --> 16:46.156
You can't let him drive her home.
She says thank you the naughty way.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.993
It's not happening.
If we were meant to be together,

16:49.080 --> 16:53.631
I never would've gone home with you
and sabotaged everything I had with him.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.678
You and I are gonna be OK, right?

16:56.760 --> 16:59.479
What do you think?

16:59.560 --> 17:01.471
Probably not.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.077
Let me know when we are.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.594
Don't hold your breath.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.954
Dr Turkelton.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.315
Actually, sir, it's Turk.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.277
That's your first name.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.794
You think my name is Turk Turkelton?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.758
And Mrs Turkelton.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.796
The Turkeltons.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.197
Can I get a Scotch?

17:37.280 --> 17:38.269
Hey, baby.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.874
I'm so sorry
I messed everything up, baby.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.871
Don't be.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.311
Let's dance.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.958
Set me up, Ted.

17:51.040 --> 17:55.511
Hi. We haven't used instruments
in a long time,

17:55.600 --> 17:59.036
so bear with us if we're a little rusty.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.031
One, two, three.

18:56.920 --> 19:01.550
<i>I guess, in the end, things seldom</i>
<i>work out exactly the way you expect.</i>

19:02.560 --> 19:06.394
- Our plane leaves in an hour.
- I just gotta check on my patient.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.271
How's it going, Mr Fitzpatrick?

19:11.360 --> 19:13.555
<i>Sometimes fate is on your side.</i>

19:13.640 --> 19:16.712
Actually, it's Father Fitzpatrick.

19:16.800 --> 19:20.076
Could you do us a quick favour?

19:20.160 --> 19:23.948
<i>Other times,</i>
<i>you've kind of sealed your own fate.</i>

19:30.640 --> 19:35.430
<i>You have to trust that whatever's</i>
<i>supposed to happen will happen.</i>

19:40.560 --> 19:44.599
<i>Somehow you always seem to end up</i>
<i>with the person you're meant to be with.</i>

19:44.680 --> 19:47.558
One, two, three.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.434
- Thanks for helping out.
- I'm only going as far as the dumpster.
