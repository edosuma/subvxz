00:00.718 --> 00:04.056
Marshall and Lily had been
together for nine wonderful years,

00:04.066 --> 00:06.826
until she dumped him and
ran off to San Francisco.

00:07.566 --> 00:10.211
The healing process
was taking a long time.

00:11.601 --> 00:14.453
Then, one night,
he made a giant leap forward.

00:14.463 --> 00:16.091
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

00:16.101 --> 00:17.230
I'll walk you out.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.474
See ya.

00:22.764 --> 00:24.855
You just checked
out Robin's ass.

00:24.865 --> 00:26.937
What? No! No, Barney, I was...

00:26.946 --> 00:28.943
Dude, that's awesome.

00:28.952 --> 00:32.039
You're finally forgetting
about that short redhead.

00:32.116 --> 00:32.783
Lily.

00:32.796 --> 00:35.973
Yes, Lily. Thank you. That was
going to drive me crazy all night.

00:35.985 --> 00:38.223
Hey, Ted, Marshall just checked
out your girlfriend's ass.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.871
- I did not, Ted, I...
- That's awesome.

00:40.886 --> 00:42.291
You're finally getting better.

00:42.306 --> 00:44.170
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

00:44.188 --> 00:47.612
Starting tonight,
I am going to teach you how to live.

00:47.628 --> 00:49.590
Ted, you had your chance.
You're out; Marshall's in.

00:49.605 --> 00:50.943
- Yes!
- Oh, God.

00:50.957 --> 00:54.791
Marshall, being a single guy
in New York City is like...

00:55.617 --> 00:57.240
What's something
everybody likes?

00:57.256 --> 00:58.260
Candy.

00:58.277 --> 01:00.800
Yes, it's like being
in a candy store.

01:00.815 --> 01:04.120
You just walk right in and
grab yourself some Whoppers.

01:04.558 --> 01:06.000
Yeah.

01:06.537 --> 01:08.103
Is Whoppers the best one?

01:08.118 --> 01:09.190
Mounds.

01:09.207 --> 01:10.522
Milk Duds.

01:10.545 --> 01:12.170
Gobstoppers.

01:12.995 --> 01:15.213
This went on for another hour;

01:15.226 --> 01:16.690
I'll just skip to the end.

01:16.705 --> 01:18.731
- Dubble Bubbles.
- Nice!

01:18.745 --> 01:20.452
Marshall. We're doing this.

01:20.465 --> 01:22.391
I am not taking
no for an answer.

01:22.408 --> 01:23.670
Fine.

01:23.687 --> 01:25.792
Hey, Robin.
Marshall checked out your ass.

01:25.808 --> 01:27.341
Ted, what is wrong with you?

01:27.356 --> 01:29.011
He checked out my ass.

01:29.026 --> 01:32.550
Hey, tell him thanks.
I felt like I was having a bad ass day.

01:32.566 --> 01:34.522
Cool, see ya.

01:37.658 --> 01:39.130
Lily.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.432
It is a great ass.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.966 --> 01:57.381
None of us had seen
Lily in three months.

01:57.398 --> 01:59.390
There were so many
unanswered questions,

01:59.406 --> 02:01.010
so many things to say.

02:01.028 --> 02:03.721
Your hair is adorable.

02:05.416 --> 02:08.320
Meanwhile, Barney was taking
Marshall out to meet women

02:08.335 --> 02:10.883
for the first time
since he was 17.

02:10.895 --> 02:13.151
Hi. Have you met Marshall?

02:13.895 --> 02:15.353
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:17.147 --> 02:19.521
Look how sweaty my hands are.

02:20.395 --> 02:22.980
It's weird, right? Uh, sweat?

02:22.996 --> 02:26.961
Like, this smelly water
coming out of your skin.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.702
It was nice meeting you.

02:30.715 --> 02:33.462
I-I-I hate to interrupt,
but, uh,

02:33.475 --> 02:35.353
do you like magic?

02:35.365 --> 02:37.431
Um, I guess.

02:39.178 --> 02:41.760
Oh, my God!

02:45.936 --> 02:48.480
Anyway, Marshall
here is awesome.

02:48.496 --> 02:50.760
Salad in a bag? His idea.

02:50.936 --> 02:53.692
Dude! You were
awesome last night.

02:53.708 --> 02:55.412
You were charming,
you were funny,

02:55.426 --> 02:57.160
you were totally
working that girl.

02:57.176 --> 02:58.563
You went home with her.

02:58.577 --> 03:00.421
Yes, I did.

03:00.745 --> 03:03.721
But she told me that
if it wasn't for me,

03:03.735 --> 03:05.261
you would have had
a shot with her,

03:05.276 --> 03:08.123
so, in hypothetical terms,
you scored last night.

03:08.137 --> 03:09.361
All right!

03:09.378 --> 03:11.240
Hypothetical high five.

03:12.746 --> 03:14.241
Nice.

03:14.258 --> 03:16.580
All right.
Tonight, we're going to go to the bar...

03:16.596 --> 03:19.333
Barney, no,
I am not going out with you ever again.

03:19.347 --> 03:22.142
Come on! I'll,
I'll teach you all of my strategies.

03:22.158 --> 03:22.933
Oh, really?

03:22.947 --> 03:25.080
My favorite, number seven:

03:25.098 --> 03:26.990
create a mystery
about yourself.

03:27.007 --> 03:30.771
That way, they become so intrigued, they
have to hang out with you all night.

03:30.787 --> 03:32.823
Oh, come on,
does that really work?

03:32.837 --> 03:35.843
Maybe  it does,
and maybe it doesn't.

03:38.308 --> 03:40.952
Damn it, that's intriguing.
Okay, I'm in.

03:43.966 --> 03:46.103
- I have something you've got to hear.
- You will not believe what just happened.

03:46.116 --> 03:47.712
You go first.

03:48.755 --> 03:51.622
I found a 1939d
penny on the subway.

03:51.696 --> 03:54.603
Just imagine the kind of history
this little copper guy...

03:54.617 --> 03:56.262
Lily's back in town.

03:56.406 --> 03:58.902
And you let me go first?

03:58.918 --> 03:59.882
Have you seen her?

03:59.895 --> 04:03.371
Yeah. I actually went
apartment-hunting with her today.

04:03.387 --> 04:04.941
How's she doing?

04:04.958 --> 04:06.690
You're not going to like it.

04:06.956 --> 04:09.213
I am doing great.

04:09.227 --> 04:11.362
This summer, best thing ever!

04:11.375 --> 04:14.132
San Francisco is so
happening right now.

04:14.146 --> 04:15.690
She's happy?!

04:15.707 --> 04:19.012
Marshall had the worst summer
of his life, and she's happy.

04:19.644 --> 04:23.442
Yeah, and I suppose her art program
was all fulfilling or whatever.

04:23.458 --> 04:27.163
Oh. The art program--
best thing ever.

04:27.277 --> 04:29.091
Oh, my God.

04:29.105 --> 04:30.973
This is your best work.

04:30.985 --> 04:34.141
In all my years teaching,
I've never seen anything so...

04:34.606 --> 04:38.841
Needless to say, this is art.

04:39.868 --> 04:42.183
I can't teach you anything.

04:45.628 --> 04:47.642
But the best part of S.F.--

04:47.655 --> 04:49.832
Oh, that's what we
call San Francisco--

04:49.845 --> 04:50.970
the people.

04:50.986 --> 04:53.233
Even just riding around
on the bus all summer.

04:53.246 --> 04:56.593
It was like a human tapestry.

04:56.717 --> 04:58.231
Hi, I'm Mike.

04:58.247 --> 05:01.313
I'm a Buddhist monk slash
adventure-traveler writer.

05:01.426 --> 05:04.862
I'm Paula.
I sing in a punk band for children.

05:04.877 --> 05:06.191
Yeah.

05:06.207 --> 05:08.000
I'm Dan, I'm a neurosurgeon.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.232
You are stunning, by the way.

05:12.526 --> 05:15.081
Wow. I'm so happy for you.

05:15.098 --> 05:17.672
Oh, she's such a...

05:19.308 --> 05:22.722
After what she did to Marshall,
she should come back here devastated,

05:22.735 --> 05:26.481
crawling on all fours over the broken
glass of her own shame and regret.

05:26.498 --> 05:28.820
You never chose sides.
I respect that.

05:28.837 --> 05:30.583
She's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

05:30.596 --> 05:32.991
Unbelievable?
What's unbelievable?

05:33.006 --> 05:34.353
Oh. Listen, Marshall.

05:34.366 --> 05:38.301
Ted found a penny on the subway,
and it's old, and that's interesting.

05:41.366 --> 05:42.952
Way to go.

05:45.835 --> 05:48.691
Okay, first of all,
that is interesting.

05:48.707 --> 05:50.163
Second,  we have to tell him.

05:50.177 --> 05:53.843
No, we don't. He's just starting to
get better, going out with Barney.

05:53.858 --> 05:57.113
I  mean, how do you think he's going to
feel when he hears Lily's moved on?

05:57.125 --> 05:59.471
- She's moved on?
- It happens.

05:59.485 --> 06:01.591
I've fallen out of love
faster than that before,

06:01.607 --> 06:04.213
sometimes, boom,
with no warning whatsoever.

06:04.225 --> 06:07.283
One day we're in love,
the next day, he's dead to me.

06:08.277 --> 06:10.472
But we're great.

06:10.486 --> 06:12.192
Honey.

06:14.757 --> 06:17.660
Now, let's review Barney's
rules for mating without dating.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.213
Lesson two, corollary five.

06:20.227 --> 06:23.591
Make a beautiful woman feel
self-conscious and unattractive

06:23.606 --> 06:24.960
and she'll be putty
in your hands.

06:24.966 --> 06:27.422
Excellent. Have you
chosen your entree?

06:27.437 --> 06:30.281
I have.
Sweet brunette, eight o'clock.

06:30.295 --> 06:32.063
Nine o'clock. Ten... thirty.

06:32.077 --> 06:33.831
She's walking to the bar.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.679
- Her? Really?
- Yeah.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.743
No, you're right.
Ambition is the enemy of success.

06:39.756 --> 06:41.453
Okay. Hit it.

06:45.415 --> 06:47.822
What's the matter, four eyes,
you got astigmatism or something?

06:47.838 --> 06:49.752
I'm sorry,
I was trying to playfully disarm you,

06:49.788 --> 06:51.230
but I just got out of
a long relationship.

06:51.265 --> 06:53.473
I have no idea what I'm doing.

06:54.326 --> 06:55.322
I'm Marshall.

06:55.338 --> 06:57.603
Hi, Marshall. Amy.

06:57.615 --> 06:59.490
Don't worry. I've been there.

06:59.505 --> 07:00.970
Hold on.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.152
Nice recovery.
I think it's working.

07:03.165 --> 07:05.931
Um, Amy.
This is my friend, Barney.

07:05.946 --> 07:07.811
Barney, this is Amy.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.692
Hi, Barney. Nice to meet you.

07:09.708 --> 07:11.140
Hi.

07:11.876 --> 07:15.490
Amy, do you like... magic?

07:15.505 --> 07:18.413
- I hate you.
- I am so sorry.

07:18.427 --> 07:21.560
It's a sickness.
I'm the real victim here.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.772
Twice.

07:22.788 --> 07:26.553
Twice in a row, you took my candy.
That was my candy.

07:26.567 --> 07:29.691
- I know, but tonight...
- No. Forget it.

07:29.708 --> 07:32.183
You're such a jackass.

07:34.766 --> 07:36.993
I thought you were
gonna call me a jerk.

07:37.878 --> 07:40.573
All right, I'm sorry.
I will make it up to you.

07:40.588 --> 07:43.523
Tonight, we'll go to a
college bar near NYU--

07:43.537 --> 07:45.443
The Scorpion and the Toad.

07:45.455 --> 07:48.771
I figure in a younger crowd you'll
seem more mature, more worldly

07:48.786 --> 07:52.290
and, as a third-year
law student, more smarter.

07:56.428 --> 07:58.720
Okay, but no magic.

08:01.298 --> 08:03.010
How did you do that?

08:03.025 --> 08:05.161
I'm taking a leak, dumb ass.

08:06.957 --> 08:10.230
The next day, Robin and I went
apartment-hunting with aunt Lily.

08:10.247 --> 08:12.913
But I need the freedom to
really chase my passion,

08:12.928 --> 08:15.172
which was painting,
but now I think it's music

08:15.188 --> 08:17.080
or spoken word-- maybe both.

08:17.098 --> 08:19.252
God! Isn't life amazing?

08:19.266 --> 08:21.952
It is so great to see you, Ted.

08:22.118 --> 08:24.933
I'm going to get the
key from the lockbox.

08:27.756 --> 08:28.710
What?

08:28.725 --> 08:31.493
She's miserable. She's realized
she's made a huge mistake.

08:31.508 --> 08:33.902
Her and Marshall will be back
together in a week. I love it!

08:33.917 --> 08:36.090
Um, no.
You just want Lily to be miserable.

08:36.107 --> 08:37.381
The truth is, she's happy.

08:37.395 --> 08:39.423
Trust me.
I've known Lily for nine years.

08:39.437 --> 08:40.681
Trust me. I'm a girl.

08:40.698 --> 08:42.553
Yeah, but you're Canadian.

08:42.565 --> 08:44.873
- Why do you always have to bring that up?
- You're our weird neighbors to the north.

08:44.905 --> 08:49.011
- You bring it up every time.
- Five bucks says she still wants Marshall.

08:49.026 --> 08:50.302
You're on.

08:50.317 --> 08:51.822
Five American bucks.

08:51.837 --> 08:53.481
Damn it.

08:53.608 --> 08:55.853
Okay, so how do we get
the truth out of her.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.771
Tequila. It's her weakness.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.383
Three shots, she'll tell you
the truth about anything.

09:00.727 --> 09:03.622
I hope this is my new home.

09:05.986 --> 09:09.111
Yeah, I'm going to take
that first apartment.

09:10.277 --> 09:12.291
Marshall Eriksen, suit up!

09:12.308 --> 09:13.050
No way.

09:13.067 --> 09:14.723
Yeah, you're good in that.

09:14.738 --> 09:16.820
- Let's go.
- Wait.

09:16.837 --> 09:18.633
Empty your pockets.

09:19.555 --> 09:20.873
Come on.

09:26.068 --> 09:28.340
- Come on, let's...
- Sleeves.

09:28.358 --> 09:31.380
- There is nothing in my...
- Oh, is that right?

09:38.565 --> 09:40.080
Let's go.

09:40.505 --> 09:44.670
- Behind my ear.
- There is nothing behind your...

09:50.208 --> 09:52.892
Yeah, I'm in pre-law.
The workload's killing me, though.

09:52.908 --> 09:56.290
Oh, tell me about it.
I'm third year at Columbia Law, so...

09:56.308 --> 09:59.590
if the workload does kill you,
I can probably get a conviction.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.052
Yeah.

10:02.067 --> 10:04.050
You must be majoring
in chemistry,

10:04.067 --> 10:07.153
'cause what I'm picking
up between us is, uh...

10:07.848 --> 10:10.432
College lesbian phase.

10:13.976 --> 10:17.953
Listen, I got to go,
but it'd be great to see you again.

10:18.108 --> 10:20.273
Yes, it would.

10:20.505 --> 10:22.592
It really would.

10:23.215 --> 10:25.763
Well, maybe I'll see
you here sometime.

10:25.888 --> 10:28.631
Probably not.
I'm never here, so...

10:28.856 --> 10:30.773
You know,
I do have a phone number.

10:30.787 --> 10:32.391
Great.

10:32.785 --> 10:34.511
Nice.

10:34.627 --> 10:36.961
- Hi, I'm Barney.
- Oh, no.

10:36.977 --> 10:40.751
Do you... mind giving my friend 
your phone number?

10:40.768 --> 10:42.441
Sure.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.761
Whoo!

10:45.778 --> 10:48.591
I did it!
I got a girl's phone number.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.043
Oh, and her handwriting
is so cute, look.

10:51.058 --> 10:52.673
Oh, I'm gonna take her
out for Chinesr food

10:52.708 --> 10:54.192
and then maybe we'll
walk through the park.

10:54.228 --> 10:56.512
It'll be so... what?

10:56.747 --> 10:59.723
Sorry, buddy,
I'm taking this one, too.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.040
I'll kill you!

11:06.056 --> 11:08.512
And  then, I discovered this area,
North Beach.

11:08.527 --> 11:10.303
Best beach ever!

11:10.318 --> 11:13.652
Oh, I've been blabbering
on about my summer.

11:13.666 --> 11:15.373
How are you guys doing?

11:15.385 --> 11:17.093
And hey, how's Marshall?

11:17.107 --> 11:18.992
- Give me the card!
- I'm not giving you any card.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.440
- I swear...!
- You are not getting...!

11:20.478 --> 11:21.722
Terrific.

11:21.738 --> 11:24.633
That is so good to hear.
Oh, hold on.

11:24.646 --> 11:27.360
This could be about
the apartment.

11:27.898 --> 11:29.951
Okay, we're way
past truth-telling-Lilly

11:29.968 --> 11:32.271
and about to
hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998-Lilly

11:32.285 --> 11:34.210
and I'm not cleaning
that up again.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.332
So, congratulations, you win.

11:37.345 --> 11:39.373
She's happy.

11:39.386 --> 11:41.162
I didn't get it.

11:41.317 --> 11:43.683
That first apartment, I...

11:43.695 --> 11:45.810
I waited too long and...

11:45.827 --> 11:48.283
somebody else got it.

11:51.128 --> 11:53.510
Interesting.

11:53.826 --> 11:55.600
Wow, Lily, you, uh...

11:55.617 --> 11:58.553
seem to be having a pretty strong
reaction on losing an apartment.

11:58.567 --> 12:01.591
I wonder if it's because it reminds
you of something else you lost

12:01.606 --> 12:03.871
because you couldn't commit.

12:03.885 --> 12:06.701
No, Lily,
you're crying over the crown molding

12:06.718 --> 12:09.961
and the real hardwood floors.
There's no deeper meaning.

12:09.976 --> 12:12.951
Right, Lily?
Just quit crying and tell him.

12:13.898 --> 12:18.952
The apartment is a
metaphor for Marshall.

12:22.425 --> 12:23.971
- Stop it!
- You don't want to see...

12:23.987 --> 12:25.493
- ..what I'm like when I'm angry.
- It's my card!

12:25.507 --> 12:27.040
Stop! Hold on!

12:27.056 --> 12:28.773
If we can't settle
this like gentlemen,

12:28.787 --> 12:29.922
then no one gets the number.

12:29.936 --> 12:32.761
- No! Stop the cab.
- Wha...?

12:33.886 --> 12:37.123
No, wait. Come on. Marshall!

12:37.137 --> 12:39.383
81st and First, please.

12:42.015 --> 12:45.110
Ah,  she does have
cute handwriting.

12:46.078 --> 12:47.560
The thing about a hangover

12:47.577 --> 12:50.012
is that everyone has
their own special remedy.

12:50.025 --> 12:51.253
Morning, guys.
What can I get you?

12:51.285 --> 12:52.513
Shh!

12:52.526 --> 12:55.571
Bring me the dirtiest,
greasiest tuna melt you got.

12:55.588 --> 12:57.272
And a milkshake.

12:57.285 --> 12:58.890
For you, sir?

12:59.628 --> 13:01.183
Gravy.

13:02.305 --> 13:04.730
You want that
gravy on something?

13:04.746 --> 13:06.512
Surprise me.

13:06.525 --> 13:10.552
I'd take you with gravy if my
boyfriend wasn't sitting right here.

13:10.566 --> 13:13.023
Just kidding. I'm good.

13:14.246 --> 13:16.503
What are you so chirpy about?

13:16.517 --> 13:18.570
She's still drunk
from last night.

13:18.586 --> 13:20.442
I don't think so.

13:20.455 --> 13:22.641
Whoo!

13:24.656 --> 13:27.061
Look, if you want
Marshall back so bad,

13:27.077 --> 13:29.532
how come it took you two
days to even ask about him?

13:29.546 --> 13:33.223
I was dying to ask.
I was just trying to play it cool.

13:33.237 --> 13:34.543
But really...

13:34.557 --> 13:36.350
But it's good, I mean,
work is great...

13:36.366 --> 13:38.350
Come on, say something about Marshall.
Where's Marshall?

13:38.387 --> 13:40.042
How's Marshall?
What's Marshall doing right now?

13:40.077 --> 13:42.481
Shut up and talk about Marshall.
Shut up and talk about Marshall.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.821
Shut up and talk about Marshall.
Marshall, Marshall,

13:44.836 --> 13:47.290
Marshall, Marshall...
I've got to ask!

13:47.306 --> 13:49.493
And hey, how's Marshall?

13:49.508 --> 13:51.350
It was such an awful summer.

13:51.365 --> 13:53.873
I just wanted to get
back here and see him.

13:53.887 --> 13:56.043
But I thought your
summer was great.

13:56.056 --> 13:58.072
Not exactly.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.473
Oh, my God.

14:00.516 --> 14:03.173
This is you best work?

14:03.497 --> 14:08.162
In all my years teaching,
I've never seen anything so needless.

14:08.177 --> 14:11.950
To say this is... art...

14:13.297 --> 14:15.572
I can't teach you anything.

14:16.358 --> 14:20.811
So all those interesting
people you met on the bus?

14:20.828 --> 14:22.453
Yeah, um...

14:22.505 --> 14:24.461
Hi. I'm Mike.

14:24.476 --> 14:28.270
I'm a Buddhist monk slash
adventure travel writer.

14:28.286 --> 14:33.013
I'm Paula.
I sing in a punk band for children.

14:33.028 --> 14:39.342
Hey, I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon.
You are stunning, by the way.

14:39.985 --> 14:43.003
I never got in touch because
I was too embarrassed.

14:43.018 --> 14:44.710
I screwed everything up.

14:44.727 --> 14:47.793
I have no job,
no place to live.

14:47.817 --> 14:50.843
I lost the love of my life.

14:51.078 --> 14:54.331
I know I have no right
to ask this, but...

14:54.348 --> 14:56.812
do you think Marshall
would take me back?

14:56.827 --> 14:58.171
In a heartbeat.

14:58.188 --> 15:01.853
If you called him up, yeah,
he'd take you back with open arms.

15:01.865 --> 15:04.940
Wow. So maybe 
I should call him.

15:04.956 --> 15:06.413
Maybe.

15:06.787 --> 15:09.451
No! This is... Ow!

15:10.597 --> 15:11.790
Hold on.

15:11.808 --> 15:14.211
Look, if you're going
to go back to him,

15:14.225 --> 15:15.360
I don't want to hear
the word "maybe."

15:15.378 --> 15:17.503
"Maybe" cannot be
in your vocabulary.

15:17.518 --> 15:19.312
This breakup almost killed him.

15:19.328 --> 15:21.670
And he cannot go
through it again.

15:21.685 --> 15:26.701
So, unless you're absolutely certain,
stay the hell away from him.

15:30.226 --> 15:32.850
This guy likes pennies.

15:35.766 --> 15:36.671
Hi, Marshall.

15:36.687 --> 15:38.840
No, go away.
I don't want to talk to you.

15:38.858 --> 15:44.060
Okay, I know what I did a couple
nights back is in a moral gray area.

15:44.077 --> 15:47.491
But the great news is,
she loved you.

15:47.505 --> 15:49.723
If things had gone your way--
you'd gone out a couple times,

15:49.756 --> 15:52.033
I think she definitely
would have had sex with you.

15:52.048 --> 15:54.591
There's no "would" in sex.

15:56.295 --> 15:59.792
You're right, I totally...
I'm just no good at this, Barney.

15:59.808 --> 16:02.931
I'm good at being in a couple,
I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend.

16:02.947 --> 16:05.010
Being single-- forget it.

16:05.026 --> 16:06.573
Come on, you can't give up now.

16:06.585 --> 16:08.841
What if I told you that
you could relive that night

16:08.856 --> 16:11.661
with the exact same conversations,
the exact same jokes

16:11.677 --> 16:15.061
only this time,
you get her and I don't.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.233
That's not possible.

16:16.247 --> 16:17.693
Oh, but it is.

16:17.706 --> 16:19.352
She has...

16:19.367 --> 16:20.972
wait for it...

16:20.986 --> 16:22.611
here it comes...

16:22.627 --> 16:24.223
almost there...

16:24.238 --> 16:26.192
an identical twin.

16:26.207 --> 16:27.763
Yes!

16:27.977 --> 16:29.931
A twin isn't the same person.

16:29.946 --> 16:32.250
Of course it is.
What do you think identical means?

16:32.268 --> 16:35.321
"Ident"-- same, "ical"-- person. 
Same person.

16:35.735 --> 16:38.093
Hey, we could double date.

16:39.315 --> 16:40.652
Fine.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.812
But you have to promise me,
you're not going to steal my new twin,

16:43.827 --> 16:48.190
and  leave me with your old,
used-up twin.

16:48.268 --> 16:49.900
Used-up?

16:49.916 --> 16:52.700
They're a human being, 
Marshall.

16:54.265 --> 16:56.600
So Uncle Marshall and
Uncle Barney went out

16:56.617 --> 16:58.972
on a double date
with the twins.

16:59.688 --> 17:01.070
How you doing?

17:01.086 --> 17:03.873
Great. Amazing.
This is so much fun.

17:03.887 --> 17:05.603
And I think me and the
girl are really clicking.

17:05.637 --> 17:07.290
You are, you definitely are.

17:07.305 --> 17:09.452
Listen, you're going
to have to leave now.

17:09.465 --> 17:11.291
I just talked with the twins,
and get this,

17:11.308 --> 17:14.291
I'm going home
with both of them.

17:14.305 --> 17:17.512
Yeah. That's happening.

17:17.857 --> 17:20.680
It is impossible that you're
doing this to me again.

17:20.698 --> 17:23.142
But they're twins.

17:23.157 --> 17:25.412
You-- you said to me
that being single

17:25.425 --> 17:27.123
would be like being
in a candy store.

17:27.137 --> 17:28.990
Well, it's not,
it's not like a candy store.

17:29.005 --> 17:32.101
It's a lawless,
postapocalyptic wasteland.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.081
- I may be your best friend...
- Actually Ted's my best friend.

17:34.115 --> 17:37.832
But in this world,
it's every hombre for himself.

17:37.845 --> 17:39.871
That's what being single is.

17:39.887 --> 17:41.843
And after nine
years in captivity,

17:41.857 --> 17:43.943
that is the single greatest lesson 
I can teach you 

17:43.958 --> 17:46.053
about surviving in the wild.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.863
Now, if you'll excuse me...

17:47.878 --> 17:49.950
I have two unique breasts

17:49.968 --> 17:52.890
and two duplicates
waiting for me.

17:57.128 --> 17:59.802
Oh, bad news--
Marshall got food poisoning.

17:59.817 --> 18:00.910
- What?
- Oh, no.

18:00.925 --> 18:03.053
That's too bad.
I really liked him.

18:03.066 --> 18:07.360
Yeah. Well, I guess 
we're just a threesome tonight.

18:17.747 --> 18:20.702
Lily, what are you doing here?

18:20.718 --> 18:23.982
Oh, I was just walking by.
I wasn't...

18:24.015 --> 18:26.802
Oh, you mean New York?
My program ended.

18:26.816 --> 18:29.660
It was just great.
Just lots of fun...

18:29.676 --> 18:32.820
It was awful.
It was the worst mistake I ever made.

18:32.835 --> 18:36.222
I'm so sorry,
Marshall, and... hello.

18:38.507 --> 18:41.482
Lily, this was the
worst summer of my life.

18:41.497 --> 18:44.212
I know.
It was the worst summer of my life.

18:44.227 --> 18:47.240
It was the hardest thing that
I've ever had to go through.

18:48.417 --> 18:51.133
Can we please get
back together?

18:52.168 --> 18:55.390
All that crap you
said to me about,

18:55.406 --> 18:58.812
"we need to figure out
who we are outside of us,

18:58.828 --> 19:01.760
and we need to learn to
do things on our own,"

19:02.638 --> 19:04.850
it broke my heart.

19:06.296 --> 19:08.872
Three months ago,
you broke my heart.

19:10.738 --> 19:13.822
Can we please get
back together?

19:15.176 --> 19:17.153
Lily, you were right.

19:18.708 --> 19:21.090
All that crap was right.

19:22.566 --> 19:24.490
So, no.

19:24.936 --> 19:27.173
No, we can't get back together.

19:27.187 --> 19:28.921
We shouldn't.

19:29.118 --> 19:31.262
At least, not right now.

19:33.666 --> 19:35.300
Wow.

19:35.596 --> 19:37.280
Okay.

19:38.565 --> 19:40.303
Yeah.

19:41.957 --> 19:43.413
Well...

19:45.405 --> 19:48.001
Will we still see each other?

19:48.475 --> 19:50.571
Yeah, yeah.

19:50.587 --> 19:52.273
I think so.

19:53.797 --> 19:55.520
I don't know.

19:56.728 --> 19:59.002
This is all really new to me.

20:00.418 --> 20:03.220
I just got out of a
long relationship.

20:07.485 --> 20:09.132
I like your hair.

20:09.388 --> 20:11.191
Thanks.

20:11.365 --> 20:15.130
I figured new city,
a different color...

20:15.145 --> 20:17.070
# ...Wide open road #

20:17.115 --> 20:20.453
# It was love to us #

20:20.468 --> 20:23.551
# It was all that we had... #

20:24.206 --> 20:27.700
And the pizza there,
worst pizza ever.

20:27.718 --> 20:31.011
I'm so glad to be
back in New York.

20:32.547 --> 20:36.150
Listen, if there's anything
I can do to even begin

20:36.166 --> 20:38.733
to make things up to you...

20:41.315 --> 20:43.842
Actually there may be something
that you can do for me,

20:43.858 --> 20:47.343
but you can never
ever ask me why.

20:47.357 --> 20:50.560
So then I was promoted to
assistant ménage-er...

20:50.577 --> 20:53.630
Manager-- why do
I keep doing that?

20:55.136 --> 20:58.712
- Lily?
- You gave me chlamydia, you jerk.

21:03.206 --> 21:06.483
So where was I?
Ah, yes, assistant ménage-er...

21:06.497 --> 21:09.541
I did it again.
I can't believe it.

21:10.425 --> 21:15.621
You gave my twin sister chlamydia.
You slime!

21:17.748 --> 21:20.220
Wha... wait, I know magic.

21:23.755 --> 21:26.210
Well played, Eriksen.

21:26.225 --> 21:28.743
Well played.
