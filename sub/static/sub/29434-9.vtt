WEBVTT

00:04.266 --> 00:07.210
Your Honor, let's face facts.

00:07.336 --> 00:10.085
It has been several weeks
of pretrial motions

00:10.173 --> 00:12.820
and diversions from the AUSA

00:12.908 --> 00:16.804
without her producing one single
shred of additional evidence

00:16.892 --> 00:20.986
that ties my client to
Special Agent Lasalle's death.

00:21.525 --> 00:22.828
Murder, Counselor.

00:23.099 --> 00:26.005
Agent Lasalle's murder.
And as you well know,

00:26.093 --> 00:28.732
we are not obligated
to prove our case until trial,

00:28.820 --> 00:30.320
which is what we're here
to schedule.

00:30.408 --> 00:32.039
A trial based on what,
Counselor?

00:32.279 --> 00:34.208
A bit of highly questionable DNA

00:34.296 --> 00:36.037
found on the finger
of the victim?

00:36.148 --> 00:39.164
Defense moves that that evidence
be suppressed, Your Honor.

00:39.252 --> 00:40.257
On what basis?

00:40.362 --> 00:42.086
How about on the basis
that the evidence

00:42.174 --> 00:44.480
was collected
by the victim's friend?

00:44.656 --> 00:47.380
On the basis that it was not
found on the victim until hours

00:47.468 --> 00:48.841
after he was
in the hospital.

00:48.929 --> 00:50.882
The same hospital
where my client was,

00:51.015 --> 00:53.695
which is how the DNA was
transferred to the victim.

00:53.819 --> 00:55.841
And on the basis
of an absolutely

00:55.929 --> 00:57.507
unreliable investigation

00:57.647 --> 00:59.856
conducted by an
obsessed federal agent

00:59.944 --> 01:03.114
who is hell-bent on
steamrolling an innocent man.

01:03.234 --> 01:05.375
Your Honor,
may I suggest

01:05.462 --> 01:09.546
that unless AUSA Izzo
is hiding a smoking gun,

01:09.757 --> 01:12.334
that we cannot and should
not continue to squander

01:12.421 --> 01:14.162
the government's
time and resources.

01:14.249 --> 01:15.921
That's for a jury to decide.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.018
Actually,

01:17.106 --> 01:19.152
at the moment,
that's for me to decide.

01:19.384 --> 01:20.811
Your Honor, defense
would like to introduce

01:20.898 --> 01:23.013
a new witness, Brad Collins.

01:23.101 --> 01:24.608
Who the hell is Brad Collins?

01:24.696 --> 01:25.733
Ms. Izzo.

01:25.821 --> 01:27.348
He is my client's alibi
for the night

01:27.436 --> 01:28.826
of Agent Lasalle's
death, Your Honor.

01:28.913 --> 01:30.200
It's been six
weeks, Your Honor.

01:30.288 --> 01:31.770
I'd like to know
what rock

01:31.858 --> 01:33.444
this witness
crawled out from under.

01:33.532 --> 01:36.194
Ms. Izzo.
That's your last warning.

01:36.506 --> 01:37.656
Sorry, Your Honor.

01:37.744 --> 01:39.187
I just can't understand

01:39.275 --> 01:42.085
why the defense is just now
bringing this witness before us.

01:42.173 --> 01:43.148
Your investigators

01:43.235 --> 01:44.733
can ask when they interview him.

01:44.821 --> 01:47.433
Meanwhile,
I'll review your motions.

01:47.521 --> 01:49.262
Your Honor, in light
of this alibi witness,

01:49.350 --> 01:51.202
I would ask the court
to reconsider bail.

01:51.290 --> 01:52.351
This is the murder

01:52.439 --> 01:54.460
of a federal agent, Counselor.

01:54.762 --> 01:57.694
We'll talk about bail when
we talk about everything else.

01:58.116 --> 01:59.280
We're adjourned.

02:07.623 --> 02:09.209
Hey, just let me know.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.652
All right?

02:10.740 --> 02:12.719
Why is this the first I'm
hearing about an alibi witness?

02:12.806 --> 02:14.819
Because it's not a real alibi.

02:15.501 --> 02:18.312
Eddie bought it,
pure and simple.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.968
Okay, Dwayne, but
can you prove that?

02:21.116 --> 02:22.491
Because if you can't,
then we lose the DNA

02:22.578 --> 02:24.020
and the case is dead.

02:24.108 --> 02:26.356
Eddie Barrett killed
Christopher. I'm certain of it.

02:26.557 --> 02:28.951
Well, your certainty doesn't
earn us our day in court.

02:29.281 --> 02:30.660
Find more evidence

02:30.748 --> 02:33.020
or Eddie Barrett walks,
guilty or not.

02:59.553 --> 03:01.049
I don't know what to tell you.

03:01.314 --> 03:02.705
I never met Eddie
Barrett before

03:02.801 --> 03:04.164
the afternoon he
chartered my boat.

03:04.252 --> 03:07.822
And he just... showed up?
Wanted to go fishing?

03:07.986 --> 03:09.892
Well, he called first,
made sure I was available.

03:09.979 --> 03:12.195
What time did he arrive?
A little after noon.

03:12.297 --> 03:13.688
It's all on the paperwork.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.494
- He was alone?
- Yes.

03:15.590 --> 03:17.596
On a cabin cruiser
that accommodates ten.

03:17.684 --> 03:20.900
Man wanted to go solo.
Said he'd had a hard few weeks

03:20.988 --> 03:23.494
and wanted to forget the world
for a couple days.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.621
Where'd you go?

03:24.959 --> 03:26.658
Redfish were the
only things biting,

03:26.746 --> 03:28.052
so not too far out.

03:28.140 --> 03:29.853
I just headed west
to a place I know.

03:29.941 --> 03:32.291
Mr. Barrett talk about
anything in particular?

03:32.439 --> 03:33.919
Well, it-it's not like that.

03:34.241 --> 03:36.096
You know how fishing goes.
There are folks

03:36.184 --> 03:39.197
who talk and fish and then there
are folks who fish and talk.

03:39.285 --> 03:40.286
He was the second kind.

03:40.374 --> 03:41.375
Why are you telling him?

03:41.463 --> 03:42.856
Hmm? I fish, too.

03:43.154 --> 03:44.767
It's-it's 'cause I'm old.

03:44.993 --> 03:47.971
So are my ideas.
But you're 100% right.

03:48.059 --> 03:49.806
Women fish, too. You said

03:49.898 --> 03:52.549
that Barrett wanted to go
out for a couple of days.

03:53.118 --> 03:56.056
Why'd you turn around
after a few hours?

03:57.035 --> 03:59.580
Mr. Barrett got a
call about 9:00 p.m.

03:59.683 --> 04:02.953
Friend of his had been shot.
I headed back to shore,

04:03.041 --> 04:04.517
but the currents
were against us.

04:04.605 --> 04:05.954
Took at least two hours.

04:06.249 --> 04:08.752
So you docked around
11:00.It's on the paperwork.

04:09.046 --> 04:11.135
I gave a copy of my invoice
to the lawyer.

04:11.223 --> 04:12.464
- You need a copy as well?
- No, no, no.

04:12.551 --> 04:14.806
- I-I got it right here. Y
- ou said Mr. Barrett

04:14.894 --> 04:16.200
paid in cash, hmm? How much?

04:16.288 --> 04:17.736
Also on the invoice.

04:17.824 --> 04:20.798
$1,100. I told him
he didn't have to pay

04:20.886 --> 04:22.588
the full two days,
but he insisted.

04:22.676 --> 04:23.895
Gave me a nice tip, too.

04:23.983 --> 04:25.289
I got to say,

04:25.883 --> 04:27.283
it's convenient,

04:28.075 --> 04:30.814
you offering this alibi
at the last moment.

04:32.697 --> 04:34.088
Why'd you wait so long

04:34.176 --> 04:36.033
to come forward, Mr. Collins?

04:36.244 --> 04:37.814
I didn't know anyone
was looking for me.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.228
I had a couple charters
booked,

04:39.316 --> 04:40.650
headed down
to Mexico,

04:40.737 --> 04:42.774
- messed around there for a while.
- Come on, your cell phone

04:42.861 --> 04:43.882
didn't work in Mexico?

04:43.970 --> 04:44.994
Not where I go.

04:45.082 --> 04:46.113
When I got
back home,

04:46.201 --> 04:48.526
I saw the messages from
Mr. Barrett's lawyer.

04:48.614 --> 04:50.007
I feel bad he spent time in jail

04:50.094 --> 04:52.662
because of me
not checking my voice mails.

04:52.975 --> 04:55.151
Better late than never, I guess.

05:03.767 --> 05:05.675
He's a good witness.

05:05.923 --> 05:07.829
He's likable, no attitude.

05:08.025 --> 05:11.431
If we can't break his story,
Barrett's gonna go free.

05:11.563 --> 05:14.671
I'm trying to get a warrant
for his entire invoice pad.

05:14.883 --> 05:17.468
If he fudged the paperwork,
we'll figure it out.

05:17.556 --> 05:19.344
Patton and I have been
digging, trying to find something

05:19.431 --> 05:21.188
that ties him to Barrett
before booking the charter.

05:21.275 --> 05:22.750
- Nothing so far.
- Yeah, well, we need

05:22.837 --> 05:25.129
to get a warrant for his house,

05:25.766 --> 05:29.181
his office, his boat,
his bank accounts.

05:29.275 --> 05:30.929
He got paid in cash.
There's got to be

05:31.017 --> 05:33.069
a bag of money
sitting somewhere.

05:33.157 --> 05:35.462
No judge is gonna give us
a warrant that broad.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.218
Brad Collins

05:38.306 --> 05:41.148
is connected to
Barrett's operation.

05:41.236 --> 05:42.973
We just need to find out how.

05:43.378 --> 05:44.335
DNA evidence

05:44.423 --> 05:46.101
is likely gonna be thrown out.

05:46.189 --> 05:47.934
Where are we
on Christopher's crime scene?

05:48.021 --> 05:49.849
Went over every inch
of it again.

05:50.306 --> 05:51.983
Nothing new turned up.

05:52.071 --> 05:54.679
How about, uh, Sue-Ann Hughes?

05:54.767 --> 05:56.804
I mean, she got shot
along with Christopher.

05:56.908 --> 05:59.376
Pulled a gun on me. She knows
more than she's saying.

05:59.464 --> 06:01.868
She's not, she's not
saying anything.

06:01.956 --> 06:04.564
She's just sitting in a cell,
waiting for her trial.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.282
We had Patton
dig into her past.

06:07.370 --> 06:08.548
She has no criminal history,

06:08.636 --> 06:09.799
she has no connection
to Barrett.

06:09.886 --> 06:11.056
We don't have
a way to prove

06:11.144 --> 06:12.581
that she set Lasalle up.

06:12.669 --> 06:14.665
Well, that's
just not possible.

06:14.753 --> 06:16.806
She took a bullet for Eddie.

06:17.130 --> 06:18.470
Okay? There's got
to be something.

06:19.297 --> 06:20.271
Brad Collins said

06:20.359 --> 06:22.557
that Eddie got a, a call

06:22.645 --> 06:25.208
letting him know
that Sue-Ann had been shot.

06:25.319 --> 06:26.748
Where are we
on Barrett's cell phone?

06:26.835 --> 06:29.847
It's a prepaid burner phone.
Claims he lost it

06:29.935 --> 06:31.319
somewhere in the hospital.
There's no way to track it.

06:31.406 --> 06:33.857
Barrett's not smarter
than we are. Come on!

06:34.754 --> 06:35.905
Pride, I don't
want to ask this,

06:35.992 --> 06:37.753
but I-I feel like
I have to, okay?

06:37.841 --> 06:39.772
And it's not because I-I think
that Barrett's a good guy,

06:39.859 --> 06:41.935
'cause obviously
he's a-a drug dealing jerk,

06:42.023 --> 06:43.216
but, uh,

06:43.380 --> 06:47.005
is it possible
that he didn't kill Lasalle?

06:47.093 --> 06:48.310
No.

06:49.639 --> 06:51.771
Okay. Yeah. There it is.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.357
He's more than
just a drug dealer.

06:59.576 --> 07:02.482
People who work for him,
they act differently

07:02.570 --> 07:04.974
than your
typical gang members.

07:06.364 --> 07:08.279
People are willing
to die for him.

07:08.493 --> 07:09.687
There's something else
going on here.

07:09.774 --> 07:10.959
If we don't figure out
what it is,

07:11.046 --> 07:12.743
he might get away with this.

07:40.820 --> 07:43.388
Hey. You didn't come down
to the kitchen tonight.

07:43.592 --> 07:44.896
I did not.

07:44.999 --> 07:48.742
Eh, based on what's
going on, I thought

07:48.840 --> 07:51.016
you might forget to eat. Well,

07:51.447 --> 07:54.189
I'd lie to you,
except I'm too tired.

07:54.346 --> 07:56.880
Going that well, huh? Not so great.

07:56.968 --> 08:00.161
I got the best investigators
in the Southeast,

08:00.898 --> 08:04.946
and despite weeks of work,
we've found nothing.

08:05.268 --> 08:07.208
Absolutely nothing

08:07.296 --> 08:10.430
that ties Eddie Barrett
to Christopher's murder.

08:10.537 --> 08:12.017
Well, he's smart.

08:12.309 --> 08:14.005
So it seems. One of the things

08:14.093 --> 08:15.506
I admire most about
you, big brother,

08:15.593 --> 08:17.591
is that you're not
afraid to zag

08:17.844 --> 08:19.919
if zigging
isn't working.

08:20.199 --> 08:21.722
You'll figure something out.

08:22.497 --> 08:24.521
Now, my mama always
said that black beans

08:24.609 --> 08:26.107
were the answer to everything.

08:26.291 --> 08:28.974
Why don't you try some,
see if it's true.

08:30.281 --> 08:31.302
Thank you, Jimmy.

08:31.595 --> 08:32.957
You're welcome.

08:33.077 --> 08:35.871
I will see you in the morning.Yeah.

08:44.030 --> 08:45.479
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.749
- Yeah. - Thank you.
- Hey.

08:47.864 --> 08:49.250
What's up? We came
as fast as we could.

08:49.337 --> 08:50.730
Everything okay? Ooh.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.802
I got quiche in the Bywater.

08:52.890 --> 08:54.209
- All right.
- Yeah.

08:54.297 --> 08:55.319
It's early,

08:55.447 --> 08:58.155
and I knew you guys
would come in hungry.

08:58.243 --> 09:00.186
Well, okay,
now that we're all here,

09:00.354 --> 09:01.747
what happened?

09:01.835 --> 09:06.108
I was up most of the night
working on catching Eddie,

09:06.714 --> 09:08.904
and in the shower this morning,

09:08.992 --> 09:12.169
I realized that
we're on a losing path.

09:12.257 --> 09:13.381
Hey, don't say that.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.301
We're gonna find a break
in the case soon. - Yeah.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.728
- We're not giving up, Pride.
- No, no,

09:16.815 --> 09:18.817
I'm not giving up either,
but if you four

09:18.959 --> 09:21.811
haven't found anything,
there's nothing to be found.

09:22.371 --> 09:24.163
You got another idea,
don't you?

09:24.334 --> 09:26.256
We've been so focused

09:26.344 --> 09:30.881
on putting Barrett into prison
for Christopher's murder...

09:32.133 --> 09:34.209
Truth is, we can't.

09:34.482 --> 09:35.992
Not now.

09:36.217 --> 09:37.295
So...

09:37.410 --> 09:39.600
So we bring him in
on something else.

09:39.816 --> 09:41.795
- Yes.
- Hmm. Cade's murder went cold

09:41.883 --> 09:43.380
when the guy who confessed to it
committed suicide.

09:43.467 --> 09:44.116
Right.

09:44.211 --> 09:47.514
But everything sources back
to the drug operation

09:47.657 --> 09:50.436
that Eddie was clearly
running in Mobile.

09:50.524 --> 09:53.772
Okay. All right. So, what, we-we
go after him for dealing drugs?

09:53.883 --> 09:56.694
No, not just for dealing. We
need to prove he was the boss.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.467
Because if we can,
then any crime associated

09:59.555 --> 10:02.272
with the drug ring,
we can tie to Eddie.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.405
We RICO his ass.

10:03.493 --> 10:05.368
- Exactly.
- Barrett has been spending

10:05.456 --> 10:07.649
a lot of time and energy
covering up these murders.

10:07.737 --> 10:10.391
Hopefully he hasn't been
focused on much else.

10:10.494 --> 10:11.813
Eddie's
got access to funds.

10:11.901 --> 10:13.204
That's for sure, right?
I mean, he's got

10:13.291 --> 10:14.423
a thousand-dollar-an-hour lawyer

10:14.510 --> 10:16.211
and he's been paying off
false witnesses.

10:16.299 --> 10:18.002
Patton, you need
to find the money.

10:18.090 --> 10:20.558
Start with the lawyer,
see how he's getting paid,

10:20.646 --> 10:21.821
who his other clients are.

10:21.908 --> 10:22.779
Okay, I'm on it.

10:22.866 --> 10:24.824
Gregorio and Hannah,

10:24.911 --> 10:26.348
Barrett didn't just become

10:26.435 --> 10:27.838
a kingpin overnight.

10:27.926 --> 10:29.231
He had to start somewhere.
See if you can

10:29.318 --> 10:30.918
figure out where
and with who.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.839
Well, when I was looking
into Barrett's background,

10:32.926 --> 10:34.406
I ran across the name
of his cellmate

10:34.494 --> 10:36.148
at Hollier Penitentiary.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.439
Racked with the guy for two
years. The guy's still inside.

10:39.527 --> 10:41.007
Go see him. Okay, okay.

10:41.697 --> 10:43.931
I am also... here.

10:44.019 --> 10:48.197
Yes. You and I, we are
gonna watch Eddie.

10:48.705 --> 10:49.760
How hard can that be?

10:49.848 --> 10:51.589
The dude's
still in prison, right?

10:52.454 --> 10:55.181
You can explain on the way.
Love it.

10:55.666 --> 10:57.161
The judge is
about to reconvene.

10:57.248 --> 10:58.619
It's not looking
good for us.

10:58.784 --> 11:01.486
Please tell me you've
undermined Barrett's alibi.

11:01.574 --> 11:03.141
No. It's rock-solid.

11:03.244 --> 11:04.838
I'm not gonna be able
to hold Eddie,

11:04.926 --> 11:05.927
much less convict him.

11:06.015 --> 11:07.283
We don't want you to hold him.

11:07.371 --> 11:08.853
We want you to let him go.

11:10.445 --> 11:12.681
- You want me to drop the charges?
- Yeah.

11:12.769 --> 11:15.041
Eddie's proven that we
can't get anything on him

11:15.145 --> 11:18.220
while he's locked up,
so send him into the world.

11:18.387 --> 11:19.595
Let him think he's won.

11:19.683 --> 11:21.299
Yeah, 'cause then
he'll make a mistake.

11:21.577 --> 11:23.103
And we'll be there to see it.

11:33.559 --> 11:36.117
It's been about ten years
since I had visitors,

11:36.205 --> 11:39.281
but, uh, it is traditional
to bring a gift.

11:39.369 --> 11:42.008
We just need you to answer
some questions

11:42.421 --> 11:44.319
about Eddie Barrett.
Uh, pastries? Candy bar?

11:44.407 --> 11:46.547
Maybe a deposit in
my commissary account?

11:46.635 --> 11:48.187
He was your cellmate
for two years.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.624
But you brought nothing.

11:49.712 --> 11:51.258
Which is inconsiderate.

11:51.346 --> 11:53.383
Sid, focus.
Eddie Barrett.

11:53.471 --> 11:54.898
What's in it for me?

11:54.986 --> 11:56.945
Mm, would make you
feel good.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.570
You did the right thing.

11:58.658 --> 12:00.093
Warden says you
got bad knees.

12:00.181 --> 12:01.555
He's willing to switch
your work detail

12:01.642 --> 12:02.773
from laundry to library.

12:02.861 --> 12:04.187
Well, now, that's a start.

12:04.275 --> 12:06.436
It's a one-time offer
with a time limit.

12:06.524 --> 12:09.390
So, you need to tell us
how Eddie Barrett spent his time

12:09.478 --> 12:11.523
- when he was inside.
- Oh, that's easy.

12:11.758 --> 12:15.117
He started a prison glee club.
Almost made the state finals.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.211
- Okay, we're out of here.
- Good one.

12:16.299 --> 12:18.140
Ah, hold on, hold on.

12:18.228 --> 12:20.012
Geez, I'm
just playing.

12:20.315 --> 12:23.054
Sid, get serious.
What was he into?

12:26.072 --> 12:27.929
When Eddie
first got here,

12:28.419 --> 12:30.500
he was into hiding
in the shadows.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.707
Keeping away from the predators.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.125
Feeling sorry for himself
about getting sent away.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.679
And then?

12:36.767 --> 12:38.336
He's smart.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.773
Adaptable.

12:39.861 --> 12:41.984
He watched.
He listened.

12:42.072 --> 12:43.976
He figured out
how the place worked.

12:44.451 --> 12:45.713
Then he took it over.

12:45.940 --> 12:47.028
Took over, how?

12:47.631 --> 12:48.758
Well, he knew
how to help

12:48.846 --> 12:50.656
the right people
so they'd help him.

12:50.907 --> 12:53.367
When they graduated,
there was a vacuum.

12:54.049 --> 12:56.489
Eddie would fill it.
Became the man to go to.

12:56.577 --> 12:57.970
For drugs?

12:58.058 --> 12:59.905
Well, lots of inmates
can hook you up with drugs,

12:59.992 --> 13:02.318
but Eddie had a special
connection for the good stuff.

13:02.406 --> 13:04.408
- What's the good stuff?
- Opioids.

13:04.496 --> 13:06.189
Now, I don't
partake personally,

13:06.277 --> 13:09.529
but... it is popular
amongst the younger crowd.

13:09.617 --> 13:11.668
- How did he get the opioids in?
- He didn't have to.

13:11.755 --> 13:13.089
They were already here.

13:13.633 --> 13:16.630
Physician's assistant
in the infirmary.

13:17.185 --> 13:20.490
He provided Eddie with
anything he wanted.

13:20.818 --> 13:22.698
Codeine, hydrocodone.

13:22.786 --> 13:24.427
- Fentanyl?
- Oh, yeah.

13:24.529 --> 13:27.825
That was big business
until Eddie got released.

13:29.036 --> 13:30.568
Whole thing dried up.

13:31.263 --> 13:32.975
No one took it over?

13:34.661 --> 13:38.896
When Eddie left...
P.A. left, too.

13:39.708 --> 13:41.878
You got a name for the
physician's assistant?

13:41.966 --> 13:43.112
Yeah, Lewis Franklin.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.722
Personnel director's
pulling his file for us.

13:45.810 --> 13:47.330
This might be the break we need.

13:47.418 --> 13:48.792
Yeah, we'll let you know
when we track him down.

13:48.879 --> 13:50.464
Right now we're headed
to Orleans Parish Prison

13:50.551 --> 13:51.551
to talk to Sue-Ann.

13:51.645 --> 13:53.028
We keep you posted, all right?

13:53.176 --> 13:55.606
- Bye, guys.
- Bye-bye.

13:57.535 --> 14:00.996
All right,
license plate KNX R47.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.332
And that is the fourth car
to arrive

14:06.489 --> 14:07.706
in the last three hours to a house

14:07.793 --> 14:08.641
we didn't even know
Barrett had

14:08.728 --> 14:10.559
in the city.
How is that possible?

14:10.647 --> 14:12.385
He's been running
a major drug ring.

14:12.473 --> 14:14.942
He's paranoid.
He's smart.

14:15.207 --> 14:17.192
Nothing's gonna be
under his name.

14:20.957 --> 14:23.744
Physician's assistant seems
like it's a solid lead.

14:23.832 --> 14:24.908
Yeah, hope so.

14:24.995 --> 14:26.309
You know, before, I...

14:26.793 --> 14:28.965
I didn't really mean that
Barrett might be innocent.

14:29.364 --> 14:31.869
- I know.
- I just felt like... uh...

14:31.956 --> 14:34.009
You should ask the hard questions.

14:34.361 --> 14:36.133
Make sure we cover
all the possibilities.

14:36.221 --> 14:38.752
- Yeah, something like that.
- Like any good investigator.

14:39.050 --> 14:40.720
Even if they

14:40.808 --> 14:43.853
were worried a little bit it
might piss their boss off.

14:45.615 --> 14:47.015
Exactly like that.

14:50.462 --> 14:51.708
Okay.

14:51.796 --> 14:53.916
Car belongs to an accountant

14:54.509 --> 14:56.642
with a major firm downtown.

14:58.330 --> 15:01.080
Okay. So far,
then, we have two lawyers,

15:01.168 --> 15:03.064
a banker and an accountant.

15:03.239 --> 15:05.392
Barrett just making sure
the books are in order?

15:05.480 --> 15:07.094
It doesn't need to make sense.

15:07.538 --> 15:09.887
We just have to be able to
follow the bread crumbs.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.900
Until they lead us to
the oven in the forest.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.463
Hopefully not.
Hopefully,

15:16.551 --> 15:19.386
this all just helps us put
Barrett away for good.

15:22.074 --> 15:25.470
I miss him. Lasalle, I mean.

15:29.193 --> 15:30.713
Yeah, me, too.

15:33.609 --> 15:35.756
Okay, just let me do all
the talking, all right?

15:36.374 --> 15:37.718
Hello.

15:37.993 --> 15:40.010
I'm gonna save you both
a lot of time.

15:40.198 --> 15:43.127
My client
has nothing to say about Eddie Barrett.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.577
Since when is she your client?

15:44.665 --> 15:45.845
Since two days ago.

15:45.933 --> 15:47.315
She felt that the public defender

15:47.403 --> 15:49.151
did not have her best
interests at heart.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.909
- And you do?
- Well, I know she doesn't want to be

15:50.996 --> 15:52.845
railroaded by
overzealous federal agents

15:52.933 --> 15:54.238
gunning for Eddie Barrett.

15:54.326 --> 15:55.604
Well, that sounds like
what's best for Eddie,

15:55.691 --> 15:57.074
but what's best for you,
Sue-Ann?

15:57.162 --> 15:58.424
Please don't talk to
my client.

15:58.537 --> 16:00.919
Because we don't think
that it makes sense

16:01.007 --> 16:03.539
for Sue-Ann to spend ten
years in a federal prison

16:03.627 --> 16:05.174
when Eddie just got released.

16:05.291 --> 16:07.853
- Really? Oh, that's great.
- Sue-Ann,

16:07.997 --> 16:09.463
you pulled a gun
on a federal agent.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.853
That's gonna mean at least
some years in a federal lockup.

16:11.941 --> 16:13.758
Sue-Ann felt threatened
by Agent Pride

16:13.846 --> 16:14.939
when he showed up to arrest

16:15.027 --> 16:16.931
Eddie Barrett on false charges.

16:17.136 --> 16:18.675
She was under the
influence of medication

16:18.762 --> 16:19.943
given to her at the hospital.

16:20.031 --> 16:21.379
She is innocent.

16:21.467 --> 16:23.716
And I like our chances
of getting her off

16:23.804 --> 16:25.681
- free and clear.
- Maybe.

16:25.769 --> 16:26.783
But maybe not.

16:27.123 --> 16:29.322
It's at least a six-month
wait before a trial.

16:29.485 --> 16:31.594
And you, Mr. Campbell, you
get to go home after this.

16:31.681 --> 16:33.018
If you cooperate with us,

16:33.105 --> 16:35.037
Sue-Ann, the AUSA will
commute your sentence,

16:35.124 --> 16:36.550
and you'll get out of
here with time served.

16:36.637 --> 16:37.900
I don't know what that means.

16:37.988 --> 16:40.744
That means that you get to
go home, Sue-Ann, for good.

16:40.832 --> 16:43.838
It means that they want
you to change your story.

16:43.926 --> 16:45.049
It means that
they want you

16:45.137 --> 16:47.916
- to lie to hurt Eddie.
- I could never...

16:48.012 --> 16:49.096
Listen,
we know Eddie Barrett

16:49.183 --> 16:50.765
set Christopher Lasalle
up to get killed,

16:50.852 --> 16:52.392
and he used you to do it.

16:52.523 --> 16:54.674
All we need is
he truth from you.

16:54.886 --> 16:57.218
Stop talking directly
to my client.

16:57.306 --> 16:58.244
You're confusing her.

16:58.332 --> 16:59.646
I'm not confused.

16:59.734 --> 17:00.549
Hmm.

17:00.637 --> 17:01.939
Would you like
to speak privately?

17:02.026 --> 17:03.141
I can have them wait outside.

17:03.228 --> 17:04.228
No.

17:04.820 --> 17:05.835
Look, I'm sorry.

17:05.922 --> 17:07.542
I can't help you.

17:07.810 --> 17:09.892
I didn't see anything.
I don't know anything.

17:10.002 --> 17:11.535
I just got shot.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.262
Sue-Ann, did you hear what we said?

17:13.349 --> 17:14.897
Eddie is free.

17:15.054 --> 17:17.433
Why would you stick to
this story and lie for him?

17:17.521 --> 17:19.792
And... we are done here.

17:20.036 --> 17:22.222
And you are done
harassing my client.

17:22.310 --> 17:24.621
And the next time I get a
call from the prison saying

17:24.709 --> 17:26.675
you want to talk to her,
guess what.

17:26.858 --> 17:28.558
I'll get an injunction.

17:29.192 --> 17:30.793
We understand?

17:32.597 --> 17:33.628
Okay.

17:33.716 --> 17:35.605
Yeah. Yeah, we'll see
you when you get back.

17:36.206 --> 17:37.721
Pride and Sebastian
have turned the stakeout

17:37.808 --> 17:38.895
over to the surveillance team.

17:38.982 --> 17:40.239
Pride must have been disappointed

17:40.326 --> 17:41.411
- Sue-Ann didn't bite.
- Yeah, well,

17:41.498 --> 17:42.902
it's not much of a surprise,

17:42.990 --> 17:44.338
given that Campbell's her lawyer.

17:44.426 --> 17:45.997
He's got her believing that
everything's gonna be fine.

17:46.084 --> 17:47.019
So where does this leave us?

17:47.107 --> 17:48.688
In the capable hands of Triple P.

17:48.867 --> 17:51.332
I dug into Lewis Franklin,
the physician's assistant

17:51.597 --> 17:53.421
who supplied Barrett
with the drugs inside.

17:53.509 --> 17:55.618
He must've left his job right
after Barrett's release.

17:55.705 --> 17:57.868
And under suspicious circumstances.

17:57.987 --> 18:00.618
Prison investigators were all
over him. Even arrested him.

18:00.782 --> 18:02.097
- And no charges?
- Nope.

18:02.232 --> 18:04.564
And he was released. And
guess who his lawyer was.

18:04.652 --> 18:05.681
Ugh.

18:05.769 --> 18:07.710
I'm really starting
to dislike this guy.

18:07.798 --> 18:10.400
Okay. We need to pick
Franklin up. Where is he?

18:10.488 --> 18:11.936
Monroe,
but he's not gonna talk.

18:12.090 --> 18:14.205
- Why not?
- He was murdered this morning.

18:14.323 --> 18:16.133
Shot in the head outside
his house.

18:16.341 --> 18:17.533
Call Monroe PD.

18:17.621 --> 18:19.461
- We need to get the body to Wade.
- I'm on it.

18:19.737 --> 18:22.439
I'm gonna call Pride.
I'll let him know.

18:29.540 --> 18:30.939
Hello there.

18:32.032 --> 18:36.803
It's, uh... four hours
old, probably disgusting.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.275
Thank you.

18:40.641 --> 18:41.996
You look terrible.

18:42.084 --> 18:44.800
I mean that in the nicest way possible.

18:45.783 --> 18:46.806
Thank you again.

18:46.901 --> 18:48.215
Mm-hmm.

18:49.236 --> 18:50.673
I'm not gonna lie.

18:51.001 --> 18:53.829
Eddie Barrett makes me feel
like I'm two steps behind.

18:54.110 --> 18:55.244
Yeah, well...

18:56.953 --> 18:58.180
We're still trying to figure out

18:58.267 --> 19:00.548
what this guy is capable of, you know.

19:02.422 --> 19:04.322
Biggest case of my life.

19:05.663 --> 19:07.501
Feel like I'm failing.

19:09.612 --> 19:11.293
Like I'm failing Chris.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.158
No. You're not failing.

19:14.095 --> 19:16.009
You just haven't succeeded yet.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.939
Okay.

19:18.027 --> 19:19.542
I tried to lift the mood. How'd I do?

19:19.630 --> 19:21.376
- I appreciate the effort.
- All right.

19:24.893 --> 19:26.783
My money's on you, Pride.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.501
Always.

19:36.524 --> 19:37.868
This is Pride.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.596
He's where?

19:43.146 --> 19:44.353
No, no. No.

19:44.441 --> 19:46.885
Stay outside, keep eyes
on him. I'm on my way.

19:47.095 --> 19:48.683
What is it?

19:49.726 --> 19:51.986
Barrett just showed up at my bar.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.579
My guess is...

19:57.845 --> 19:59.445
the hours must be painful.

20:02.481 --> 20:05.955
Ah, you get used to it
after a while.

20:06.043 --> 20:08.025
Start telling yourself
that missing mornings

20:08.113 --> 20:09.118
- isn't a problem?
- Yeah.

20:09.205 --> 20:11.120
- Exactly.
- It's got to be worth it, though.

20:11.207 --> 20:12.885
Because your work is profound.

20:13.241 --> 20:15.088
You see people at their most real.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.650
You mean drunk?

20:17.805 --> 20:19.419
I mean, stripped of any pretense.

20:19.623 --> 20:21.572
- Their happiest, their saddest...
- Hmm.

20:21.761 --> 20:23.208
...whatever they're going through.

20:23.296 --> 20:24.544
And they want to talk to you.

20:24.632 --> 20:27.314
- Like a priest.
- Never thought of it that way.

20:27.673 --> 20:29.517
My work's kind of similar.

20:29.605 --> 20:30.744
Oh, yeah? What do you do?

20:30.832 --> 20:32.165
He's a murderer, Jimmy.

20:34.563 --> 20:35.677
Dwayne.

20:35.765 --> 20:37.400
Special Agent Pride.

20:37.884 --> 20:39.653
Nice to see you again.

20:40.093 --> 20:41.348
Buy you a drink?

20:41.480 --> 20:43.729
- Who is this?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy.

20:43.972 --> 20:45.520
My name's Eddie Barrett.

20:47.073 --> 20:48.356
Dwayne, I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

20:48.444 --> 20:50.361
What the hell are you doing
in my bar?

20:50.449 --> 20:52.574
I wanted a little exercise.

20:53.198 --> 20:54.907
Plus, those cops
who were watching me

20:54.995 --> 20:56.809
seemed a little antsy.

20:58.167 --> 21:00.731
- You need to leave now.
- Keep cool.

21:01.591 --> 21:03.707
You don't want to lay hands
on me. It's a bad look.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.554
Must be nice to work
with family.

21:08.164 --> 21:10.434
You do not want
to mess with me

21:10.625 --> 21:12.403
or any of my people.

21:12.491 --> 21:14.061
Understand, Barrett?

21:15.190 --> 21:18.006
'Cause I can go outside the
lines just as easy as you.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.358
But what would that prove?

21:21.021 --> 21:23.365
Violence begets violence.

21:24.068 --> 21:25.584
You're already a man down.

21:25.672 --> 21:27.529
- Why risk anyone else?
- That a threat?

21:27.617 --> 21:28.832
Go upstairs.

21:29.048 --> 21:30.592
Get some rest.

21:32.521 --> 21:35.257
Nothing good comes from
the path you're on.

21:43.402 --> 21:44.516
Yeah.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.053
He just left.

21:46.141 --> 21:47.165
No.

21:47.253 --> 21:49.936
He made you.
Get another team on him.

21:50.273 --> 21:51.701
I'll follow him for now.

21:51.789 --> 21:54.358
- Dwayne, um, I...
- I know. I know.

21:54.510 --> 21:56.380
Just stay put.
Be careful.

21:56.804 --> 21:58.255
I got to go.

22:20.154 --> 22:22.436
He's heading
into the Quarter now.

22:22.547 --> 22:23.861
Toward the river.

22:24.435 --> 22:26.286
Gonna need a four-man surveillance team.

22:26.520 --> 22:28.286
No, I-I'm good on my own

22:28.374 --> 22:29.747
right now.

22:30.706 --> 22:32.950
Yeah, just tell the guys
to get here here soon.

22:59.991 --> 23:01.208
Damn it.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.161
I lost him.

23:14.834 --> 23:17.161
How does a guy just disappear
in front of your eyes?

23:17.276 --> 23:18.690
I don't know.

23:18.894 --> 23:21.610
We searched the area top
to bottom, got nothing.

23:21.697 --> 23:23.712
Patton set up cameras,
but it seems like Eddie

23:23.800 --> 23:25.482
picked this spot because
it's a dead zone.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.551
I'm not surprised.

23:27.691 --> 23:30.036
NOPD set up roadblocks.
They-they put out BOLOs,

23:30.124 --> 23:32.500
but there's no sign of Barrett.

23:33.351 --> 23:36.005
He knew he was being
watched the whole time.

23:38.302 --> 23:40.372
He wanted to show me that he could

23:41.741 --> 23:43.318
come and go as he pleases.

23:43.427 --> 23:44.427
But why?

23:44.549 --> 23:45.997
I mean, the charges were dropped.

23:46.085 --> 23:48.400
Disappearing like this,
it makes him seem guilty.

23:48.518 --> 23:50.549
He's got a plan here.

23:50.731 --> 23:52.631
We just got to figure out what.

23:58.174 --> 24:01.991
Most people we're chasing,
they don't want to get caught.

24:03.315 --> 24:05.495
But Barrett,

24:06.204 --> 24:08.719
it's not like he doesn't
want to get caught,

24:08.807 --> 24:10.528
it's like he thinks he can't.

24:10.720 --> 24:14.815
Like he's...
all-knowing, all-powerful.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.557
He's not afraid of us at all.

24:20.607 --> 24:23.682
And so far, we haven't
given him much reason to be.

24:26.878 --> 24:28.495
Try to get some rest.

24:29.953 --> 24:31.620
You're gonna need it.

24:37.473 --> 24:39.054
Loretta's got something.

24:39.142 --> 24:40.456
I'll go see her.

24:48.687 --> 24:49.698
Hey.

24:49.869 --> 24:51.221
Mm.

24:51.584 --> 24:52.832
What is all this?

24:52.920 --> 24:54.602
Uh, transcripts from the

24:54.690 --> 24:56.504
trial that sent Eddie to prison.

24:56.592 --> 24:57.988
Tammy thought it might
give us some insight,

24:58.075 --> 25:00.659
- pattern of behavior.
- He went away for manslaughter?

25:01.026 --> 25:02.448
Yeah, he pled down from murder.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.049
There was evidence
that the victim

25:04.137 --> 25:07.387
harbored a grudge. I know that
I put kebabs in here somewhere.

25:07.475 --> 25:09.168
- What was he mad about?
- Huh?

25:09.272 --> 25:12.922
Oh, the, uh, the victim
was, uh, Eddie's neighbor.

25:13.086 --> 25:15.424
Bought a used truck from
him that then broke down,

25:15.512 --> 25:17.393
so the victim tried to
get his money back,

25:17.481 --> 25:18.662
and a few days later,

25:18.750 --> 25:20.988
they got into some argument
about a barking dog

25:21.076 --> 25:22.357
and hilarity ensued.

25:22.445 --> 25:23.952
Hey. I talked to a psychologist

25:24.040 --> 25:25.844
who ran group
when Eddie was inside.

25:26.112 --> 25:28.284
He said that Eddie had
trust issues and couldn't

25:28.372 --> 25:31.010
- deal with people who challenged him.
- Yo.

25:32.142 --> 25:33.393
That's my food.

25:33.590 --> 25:35.009
Yeah, we had it for dinner
last night.

25:35.096 --> 25:36.493
Yeah, and then I brought
it in this morning.

25:36.580 --> 25:37.781
Thank you. It's delicious.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.820
Did you learn anything
else out about Eddie?

25:39.908 --> 25:41.914
Yeah. His juvie records
were sealed,

25:42.002 --> 25:43.350
but I found a social worker

25:43.438 --> 25:45.220
who told me Eddie's parents
had abandoned him.

25:45.307 --> 25:46.352
Trust issues, check.

25:46.440 --> 25:48.883
He ended up in a group
home, stayed out of trouble,

25:48.971 --> 25:50.775
but was the target of
bullying by the older boys.

25:50.862 --> 25:52.095
Doesn't like challenges, check.

25:52.182 --> 25:55.126
That's up until the group home
caught fire, two boys died.

25:55.214 --> 25:57.629
Eddie was burned badly, spent
several months in the hospital.

25:57.717 --> 25:59.650
Did anybody suspect him
of starting the fire?

25:59.738 --> 26:01.055
I know I sure do.

26:02.680 --> 26:03.958
That's gross, you know that, right?

26:04.045 --> 26:05.051
What? It's my food.

26:05.139 --> 26:07.156
- That's my fork.
- Barrett is not gonna like

26:07.244 --> 26:08.544
that Pride won't give
up on arresting him.

26:08.631 --> 26:11.207
He's gonna like it even less
when Pride finally does.

26:13.955 --> 26:15.369
Hey.

26:15.909 --> 26:18.059
Lewis Franklin, physician assistant

26:18.147 --> 26:20.329
who was supplying Eddie
with drugs in prison.

26:20.446 --> 26:21.684
Find something in the autopsy?

26:21.772 --> 26:23.762
Other than cause of death? No.

26:23.896 --> 26:26.434
Gunshot wound to the
head from close range.

26:26.584 --> 26:28.399
All that without medical school.

26:28.487 --> 26:30.068
It's not why I reached out.

26:30.691 --> 26:32.757
This fellow came in today.

26:35.550 --> 26:37.184
Brad Collins.

26:37.272 --> 26:40.188
Eddie's alibi witness.
What happened to him?

26:40.409 --> 26:42.190
The coast guard found his boat adrift.

26:42.278 --> 26:44.060
He was inside, dead.

26:44.148 --> 26:45.996
Suspected carbon monoxide poisoning.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.120
I'm not buying that story.

26:48.279 --> 26:49.879
We interviewed him,

26:49.979 --> 26:52.980
so now his alibi can be
entered into evidence.

26:53.068 --> 26:55.371
Without a chance of him recanting.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.085
Time of death?

26:57.173 --> 27:00.230
Yesterday,
sometime between noon and 3:00.

27:00.918 --> 27:02.715
Barrett was under surveillance.

27:04.027 --> 27:06.535
So he didn't kill him himself.

27:06.914 --> 27:09.563
What can you tell me
about how he died?

27:09.651 --> 27:11.199
Asphyxiated.

27:11.371 --> 27:13.953
Thing is, the blood of people who die

27:14.049 --> 27:16.230
of carbon monoxide
poisoning is cherry red;

27:16.318 --> 27:17.723
- his wasn't.
- Okay.

27:17.811 --> 27:19.598
There's also signs of
blunt force trauma

27:19.686 --> 27:20.878
to the back of the head.

27:20.966 --> 27:23.810
Carefully designed blow
to knock him out

27:23.898 --> 27:26.904
without breaking the skin,
and there's no bruising.

27:26.992 --> 27:29.417
Which means he died
quickly after being hit.

27:29.505 --> 27:30.818
Two to five minutes.

27:30.912 --> 27:33.097
- He was smothered.
- More than likely.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.873
- With what?
- I don't know yet.

27:34.961 --> 27:37.146
The evidence
is on its way from the boat.

27:37.234 --> 27:38.586
All right.
Thank you, Loretta.

27:38.674 --> 27:41.090
I could use Sebastian's help
with the analysis

27:41.178 --> 27:42.592
on a potential murder weapon.

27:42.680 --> 27:47.451
Yeah, I-I'll send him over soon
as he does one thing for me.

27:55.857 --> 27:58.263
Eddie Barrett escapes
a murder charge,

27:58.444 --> 28:01.593
but he doesn't skip town,
he ties up loose ends.

28:01.731 --> 28:04.080
Brad Collins, his alibi
witness, and Lewis Franklin,

28:04.168 --> 28:06.150
the one that can tie him
to the drug operation.

28:06.314 --> 28:08.782
He wants to avoid going back
to prison, even if it means

28:08.870 --> 28:10.719
murdering somebody that
could put him away.

28:10.807 --> 28:12.888
But there's one obvious threat
left.

28:13.732 --> 28:15.414
Sue-Ann Hughes.

28:15.502 --> 28:16.999
She's been pretty loyal so far,

28:17.249 --> 28:18.654
including letting Eddie shoot her

28:18.742 --> 28:20.640
to create plausible
deniability in Chris's murder.

28:20.727 --> 28:22.646
I'm not so sure she let him.

28:22.882 --> 28:23.964
What does that mean?

28:24.052 --> 28:26.334
Means that Pride thinks Sue-Ann
was never meant to survive.

28:26.421 --> 28:27.654
It-It's just a theory.

28:27.806 --> 28:29.990
But since Eddie's so good
at getting rid of the people

28:30.078 --> 28:31.849
that he doesn't need anymore...

28:32.049 --> 28:33.497
Why let Sue-Ann survive?

28:33.732 --> 28:36.857
We assumed that
she set Christopher up

28:36.945 --> 28:39.561
and took a bullet to
sell herself as a victim.

28:39.832 --> 28:41.608
Right, but I created a
simulation of the shooting

28:41.695 --> 28:43.217
based on forensic evidence

28:43.388 --> 28:45.287
to look at it in a different way.

28:46.348 --> 28:49.250
It's not, uh,
it's not easy to watch.

28:51.354 --> 28:52.732
So we know that
one bullet

28:52.820 --> 28:54.482
hit both
Lasalle and Sue-Ann,

28:54.570 --> 28:56.349
left a non-lethal wound
in his shoulder

28:56.437 --> 28:58.568
and her arm before
it got lodged in the floor.

28:58.656 --> 29:00.107
The assumption
was that they were

29:00.195 --> 29:04.638
stacked with Sue-Ann in
front when Eddie fired.

29:04.726 --> 29:06.607
Right, but if Eddie
was trying to kill her

29:06.695 --> 29:08.443
and aimed for center mass...

29:09.263 --> 29:11.724
And Christopher pushed
her out of the way,

29:11.812 --> 29:15.607
causing the bullet to hit
her in her arm instead.

29:17.578 --> 29:19.155
Lasalle saved her life.

29:20.536 --> 29:21.999
Yeah, he did.

29:22.099 --> 29:23.219
Yeah.

29:23.307 --> 29:24.555
It was all a setup.

29:24.720 --> 29:27.752
Eddie used Sue-Ann to
lure Chris into the woods

29:27.840 --> 29:29.521
so he could kill them both.

29:29.640 --> 29:31.366
They were both loose ends
to him.

29:31.454 --> 29:32.741
And he would've succeeded, too,

29:32.829 --> 29:34.337
if Pride and I hadn't
arrived when we did.

29:34.424 --> 29:36.206
If we can convince
Sue-Ann that this is true,

29:36.294 --> 29:37.808
maybe
she'll finally talk to us.

29:37.896 --> 29:40.930
We'd better do that before
Eddie finishes what he started.

29:41.018 --> 29:42.461
Yeah.

29:56.662 --> 29:58.125
Hey.

29:59.541 --> 30:01.983
I talked to the warden at, uh, OPP.

30:02.071 --> 30:05.891
He's gonna try to have Sue-Ann
moved to a secure cell.

30:05.979 --> 30:07.328
He's gonna try?

30:07.416 --> 30:10.133
He said space is limited.
There's not enough manpower.

30:10.228 --> 30:12.056
What do you think
about getting her transferred

30:12.143 --> 30:13.675
to the facility at Belle Chasse?

30:13.763 --> 30:15.344
There is just no way
that Eddie's lawyer

30:15.432 --> 30:16.613
is gonna let us do that.

30:16.701 --> 30:17.922
Yeah, you're right.

30:18.010 --> 30:20.392
All right, well, maybe I put
in a call to Judge Halper,

30:20.787 --> 30:22.875
see if I can get a warrant fast,

30:23.615 --> 30:25.180
get her into our custody.

30:25.929 --> 30:28.852
You really think that Eddie can
reach into that women's prison

30:28.940 --> 30:30.207
and get to Sue-Ann?

30:31.255 --> 30:33.696
In the short time that
we've dealt with Barrett,

30:33.961 --> 30:36.618
a man confessed to a
murder he didn't commit

30:37.313 --> 30:38.641
and jumped off a bridge

30:38.729 --> 30:40.454
when the charges didn't stick.

30:40.648 --> 30:44.149
He's killed four other
people that we know of,

30:44.250 --> 30:45.743
probably more that we don't.

30:45.831 --> 30:46.878
He's a psychopath.

30:46.966 --> 30:47.899
Yeah, he's something else,
too.

30:47.987 --> 30:49.535
He's charismatic and
he's good-looking,

30:49.623 --> 30:51.004
and people seem drawn
to his orbit.

30:51.239 --> 30:52.668
Willing to do
whatever he says.

30:52.756 --> 30:54.684
In other words, he's probably
already got somebody inside

30:54.771 --> 30:56.527
that prison gunning for Sue-Ann.

30:57.139 --> 30:59.566
Well, let's hope we can
stop that from happening.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.252
You realize that our suspect

31:02.340 --> 31:03.495
could have taken
whatever he used

31:03.582 --> 31:05.797
to kill Brad Collins and just
thrown it into the ocean.

31:05.885 --> 31:07.596
Anything's possible,
Sebastian.

31:07.684 --> 31:09.309
Yeah, I know.
I guess I'm just wondering

31:09.397 --> 31:11.588
if this is, uh, the
best use of our time.

31:11.676 --> 31:12.901
No.
You're wondering

31:12.989 --> 31:15.111
if it's the best use
of your time.

31:15.236 --> 31:17.182
You used to love
working in the lab.

31:17.270 --> 31:20.253
I did. I do.
I-I also love working in the field.

31:20.341 --> 31:21.667
And you also want
to take down

31:21.755 --> 31:23.736
Christopher's killer.
I understand.

31:24.067 --> 31:26.143
I want that, too, but

31:26.231 --> 31:27.486
what's the best way to do it?

31:27.574 --> 31:29.856
I know, I know.
We got to work the evidence.

31:30.206 --> 31:33.253
- Good old shoe leather, Sebastian.
- Yeah.

31:33.364 --> 31:34.480
Hold on.

31:39.386 --> 31:41.730
Got a positive amylase
response on this pillow.

31:41.818 --> 31:44.234
In the center there, about
the size of someone's mouth.

31:44.349 --> 31:48.386
Give me a swab, I'll confirm the
saliva belongs to Brad Collins.

31:52.277 --> 31:56.080
Okay, so,
if I wanted to just go ahead

31:56.168 --> 31:57.688
and suffocate s
omeone with a pillow...

31:58.743 --> 32:00.550
I guess I would hold it

32:00.834 --> 32:02.669
both ends and press down, right?

32:02.796 --> 32:05.255
Thank goodness you use
your powers for good.

32:05.343 --> 32:07.450
I know, right? If I really
wanted to kill you,

32:07.538 --> 32:08.652
no one would ever catch me.

32:08.756 --> 32:09.888
I don't mean you "you".

32:09.976 --> 32:11.325
I mean, the generic "you".

32:11.482 --> 32:13.433
I mean, there's some people
I'd probably want to kill.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.249
I don't know if I could
really kill any...

32:15.459 --> 32:16.483
Oh.

32:16.571 --> 32:18.186
Saved by the bell,
thank God.

32:18.565 --> 32:20.581
Saliva belongs to
Brad Collins.

32:20.669 --> 32:21.851
All right.

32:22.957 --> 32:25.366
I don't have any hair on here,
but I am getting some dirt

32:25.565 --> 32:27.632
and other biological material.

32:29.409 --> 32:30.843
What is that?

32:30.931 --> 32:34.022
Some sort of small sacs
with insects inside?

32:34.340 --> 32:35.405
Bladderworts.

32:36.349 --> 32:37.468
I will take

32:37.556 --> 32:39.890
"Things you don't bring up
in mixed company for 200".

32:40.305 --> 32:41.968
These are small
carnivorous plants.

32:42.095 --> 32:44.202
Most of the eating is done underground,

32:44.328 --> 32:46.046
but they produce beautiful flowers.

32:46.134 --> 32:47.913
So our suspect is a gardener?

32:48.142 --> 32:50.647
I can't say that,
but what I can say

32:50.735 --> 32:54.882
is that these plants are
reasonably rare in the U.S.

32:55.368 --> 32:57.663
They might not lead us to a person.

32:57.947 --> 32:59.628
Might lead us to a place.

32:59.746 --> 33:01.983
Yeah, well,
we'll take what we can get.

33:03.978 --> 33:05.804
Judge Halper approved the warrant

33:05.892 --> 33:07.803
- for us to take Sue-Ann into custody.
- Oh.

33:07.898 --> 33:11.179
But
her lawyer's putting up a fight.

33:11.267 --> 33:12.548
He ask why we're moving her?

33:12.636 --> 33:14.083
There was a lot of yelling.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.541
Words like, uh,

33:15.629 --> 33:20.080
harassment and federal
overreach were used.

33:20.168 --> 33:21.780
And he...

33:22.386 --> 33:24.935
he'll be personally
suing me in the morning.

33:25.023 --> 33:26.522
Uh-huh.

33:27.780 --> 33:30.233
How are you holding up, Dwayne?

33:30.677 --> 33:32.515
Well, I'm like the rest of the team.

33:33.218 --> 33:35.702
Anxious to take Eddie down.

33:36.016 --> 33:39.132
Yeah, well, you can't do
that without some sleep.

33:39.220 --> 33:41.640
I know. I tried.

33:41.756 --> 33:43.038
But I can't.

33:43.126 --> 33:44.944
It's a preexisting condition.

33:50.462 --> 33:53.655
Hurry up, Hughes. Grab
your crap and get moving.

33:53.743 --> 33:56.257
Just making sure I
didn't forget anything.

33:57.677 --> 34:00.007
Can you tell me again
why they're moving me?

34:11.348 --> 34:12.329
Hello?

34:12.417 --> 34:13.976
Hey, Hughes.

34:16.716 --> 34:18.748
I got something for you.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.766
Fight! Fight! Fight!

34:39.206 --> 34:40.655
Fight! Fight!

34:43.283 --> 34:46.092
Come on! You want to
dance?! Let's dance!

34:50.083 --> 34:52.554
Get up! Get up.

34:52.641 --> 34:54.324
- Get up.
- What's going on?

34:54.587 --> 34:56.319
Eddie sent these women
to kill you.

34:56.407 --> 34:57.858
I just saved your life.

35:04.250 --> 35:06.366
You made this up. It's not real.

35:06.659 --> 35:08.974
Need to take the blinders off.

35:09.343 --> 35:10.925
This fits the facts.

35:11.991 --> 35:13.605
Eddie tried to kill you

35:13.692 --> 35:15.219
and Christopher Lasalle saved your life.

35:15.306 --> 35:16.577
Eddie wouldn't do that.

35:16.665 --> 35:18.311
He just tried again, Sue-Ann.

35:18.480 --> 35:20.851
If I hadn't been there,
you'd be bleeding out

35:20.962 --> 35:22.044
on the concrete floor

35:22.132 --> 35:24.294
with a carved toothbrush in your ribs.

35:24.382 --> 35:25.694
What, you want a thank you?

35:25.782 --> 35:27.077
I wouldn't be here at all

35:27.165 --> 35:28.430
- if it wasn't for you.
- You wouldn't be here

35:28.517 --> 35:29.963
if you hadn't pulled a gun on me.

35:30.674 --> 35:32.827
- Also because of Eddie.
- I know it's hard

35:32.915 --> 35:35.851
to think that someone you care
about is willing to hurt you.

35:36.138 --> 35:39.108
Eddie's not just some guy.
He's special.

35:39.196 --> 35:41.578
Well, on that we agree.
He's a psychopath

35:41.684 --> 35:44.524
willing to do whatever it
takes for whatever he needs.

35:44.612 --> 35:45.929
- No.
- Yes.

35:46.017 --> 35:47.932
- He's pure love.
- Oh, yeah.

35:48.192 --> 35:50.757
Eddie killed Cade Lasalle.

35:51.061 --> 35:53.233
He killed Christopher Lasalle.

35:53.501 --> 35:56.637
He killed Lewis Franklin,
he killed Brad Collins.

35:59.137 --> 36:01.882
And you were supposed to die, too.

36:01.970 --> 36:03.983
Weeks ago,
but you didn't.

36:04.409 --> 36:07.757
So he came to the hospital
and snuck you out.

36:07.939 --> 36:10.132
If we hadn't arrested you
in the diner,

36:10.373 --> 36:12.655
Eddie was gonna kill you that night.

36:12.961 --> 36:15.929
We're the only reason
you're still breathing.

36:17.241 --> 36:19.042
Look at me.

36:20.018 --> 36:21.616
Look at me.

36:24.696 --> 36:25.765
I want you to think

36:25.853 --> 36:27.257
about that hunting cabin.

36:27.345 --> 36:29.994
Really think about it.

36:30.162 --> 36:32.671
Not what he told you
would happen.

36:34.353 --> 36:36.179
But what actually happened.

36:56.903 --> 36:58.537
I...

37:03.485 --> 37:04.633
I didn't know.

37:04.721 --> 37:06.002
Didn't know what?

37:06.090 --> 37:07.976
That he was gonna kill that man.

37:08.554 --> 37:11.070
Eddie said
he was just gonna scare him.

37:11.594 --> 37:13.015
And at-at the hospital,

37:13.103 --> 37:15.265
Eddie told me he had to kill him.

37:15.353 --> 37:18.103
That he, he did it to protect us.

37:18.725 --> 37:21.741
I... I had to believe him.

37:21.829 --> 37:24.718
He took care of me.

37:24.812 --> 37:27.444
He kept you
safe from that boyfriend.

37:27.822 --> 37:29.296
The one who beat you.

37:30.119 --> 37:32.280
Eddie helped me start over.

37:32.855 --> 37:35.069
H-He was a blessing.

37:35.557 --> 37:36.671
To all of us.

37:36.759 --> 37:38.407
Who's "all", Sue-Ann?

37:39.042 --> 37:40.190
Well...

37:40.536 --> 37:42.843
his Lost Children.

37:49.553 --> 37:51.500
Eddie Barrett is a cult leader?

37:51.588 --> 37:53.358
Yeah, well,
he "collects troubled souls

37:53.446 --> 37:54.512
and gives them hope again".

37:54.599 --> 37:55.948
At least that's how
Sue-Ann put it.

37:56.035 --> 37:57.984
Calls his followers the Lost Children.

37:58.072 --> 37:59.226
Offers salvation.

37:59.314 --> 38:01.062
How, by selling drugs
and committing murder?

38:01.195 --> 38:02.716
She laid it all out for
us. Only problem is

38:02.803 --> 38:04.509
she has no idea where Eddie's hiding.

38:04.604 --> 38:06.210
She thinks
he stays at a lot of places,

38:06.306 --> 38:07.706
but she doesn't know
where they are.

38:07.846 --> 38:08.954
He'd disappear

38:09.042 --> 38:11.196
- for weeks at a time.
- And then show up again

38:11.284 --> 38:12.611
and gets angry when
she asks where he was.

38:12.698 --> 38:15.097
Look, we didn't know he had a house
on the east side until yesterday.

38:15.184 --> 38:16.172
He probably has others.

38:16.260 --> 38:18.311
Well, Patton's been trying
to follow his financial trail.

38:18.398 --> 38:20.503
Guy has no bank accounts,
nothing under his name.

38:20.591 --> 38:22.217
So how does he pay for
the house and the lawyer?

38:22.304 --> 38:23.607
He's not. Someone else is.

38:23.695 --> 38:26.248
Tried to get a list of other
Lost Children from Sue-Ann.

38:26.419 --> 38:28.396
She says she only knows first names.

38:28.530 --> 38:30.345
You know, she did
mention a place, though.

38:30.510 --> 38:32.280
She said Eddie was supposed
to take her to a place

38:32.367 --> 38:34.449
called Jeanerette after they
got out of the hospital.

38:34.538 --> 38:35.569
What's in Jeanerette?

38:35.657 --> 38:37.072
Honestly, no idea.

38:37.193 --> 38:40.183
Bunch of old plantation
houses, sugar cane fields...

38:40.271 --> 38:41.583
Maybe some bladderworts.

38:41.671 --> 38:42.880
What the hell is
a bladderwort?

38:42.968 --> 38:44.591
Well, it's a rare carnivorous plant

38:44.679 --> 38:46.393
that we found traces
of on the pillow used

38:46.481 --> 38:47.863
to smother Brad Collins.

38:48.253 --> 38:49.792
And you think
they're grown in Jeanerette?

38:49.879 --> 38:50.814
Oh, I know that they are.

38:50.902 --> 38:51.843
It's just about narrowing down

38:51.930 --> 38:52.879
the area where they can be found.

38:52.967 --> 38:54.228
Can you narrow it down any more?

38:54.315 --> 38:55.965
Based on what we know,
unfortunately not.

38:56.081 --> 38:58.189
But there are a series
of plantation houses

38:58.277 --> 38:59.458
that run up and down the levee.

38:59.545 --> 39:02.296
Okay, well, pull addresses on everything

39:02.384 --> 39:03.613
in those target areas.

39:03.731 --> 39:05.603
We'll split up and hit 'em all.

39:05.691 --> 39:06.978
- Okay.
- Wait.

39:11.270 --> 39:12.809
I want y'all to be extra careful.

39:13.062 --> 39:15.637
Eddie killed Christopher.

39:16.473 --> 39:18.777
Now, I'm not losing anyone else today.

39:19.981 --> 39:21.277
All right?

39:21.606 --> 39:23.207
Thanks.

39:37.853 --> 39:40.910
It's like a weird family reunion.

39:41.106 --> 39:43.113
On a Tuesday.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.262
At a plantation.

39:45.542 --> 39:47.693
- Any sign of Barrett?
- No.

39:47.812 --> 39:50.941
Just... a lot of romping.

39:54.337 --> 39:55.784
Dwayne.

39:55.871 --> 39:56.887
What you got, Hannah?

39:56.975 --> 39:58.916
Nothing on Charleston.
We're moving to Maple.

39:59.004 --> 40:00.262
Hold a beat.

40:00.387 --> 40:01.481
Did you find him?

40:01.584 --> 40:02.922
Not sure what
we're looking at yet,

40:03.009 --> 40:06.158
but we've got a gathering,

40:06.246 --> 40:07.785
for lack of a better word.

40:07.873 --> 40:08.987
There he is.

40:09.110 --> 40:11.393
Try to get me,
try to catch me.

40:11.481 --> 40:12.793
Okay.

40:12.941 --> 40:15.465
He's at this plantation
on River Road.

40:15.879 --> 40:17.246
Come around the back.

40:17.403 --> 40:19.838
Gregorio and I will wait
for you here.

40:24.197 --> 40:28.285
Saw about 25 people outside,
half of 'em women and children.

40:29.170 --> 40:32.420
Nothing good comes from starting
a firefight that gets them hurt.

40:32.535 --> 40:33.822
I would argue nothing good comes

40:33.909 --> 40:35.169
from a firefight that
gets any of us hurt.

40:35.256 --> 40:37.331
We have a valid warrant.
Hopefully, Eddie's smart enough

40:37.418 --> 40:38.750
to know resisting won't
get him anywhere.

40:38.837 --> 40:40.064
Yeah? So far,
I'm not sure

40:40.152 --> 40:42.064
I would call
his thinking strictly linear.

40:42.715 --> 40:44.339
Is it me, or are you
also hearing the music

40:44.426 --> 40:45.630
from the "The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly" right now?

40:45.717 --> 40:46.731
Oh, no, it's just you.

40:46.819 --> 40:47.800
But for the record,

40:47.895 --> 40:49.918
Pride's good,
Hannah and I... we're bad.

40:50.006 --> 40:52.222
All right. No, I get it.
Cool. Nice. Subtle.

40:52.310 --> 40:53.743
I walked into that. That's fine.

41:20.051 --> 41:21.629
Federal agents!

41:22.371 --> 41:25.965
We have a lawful warrant for
the arrest of Edward Barrett.

41:26.668 --> 41:29.044
You all need to stay where you are

41:29.402 --> 41:31.145
and remain calm.

41:32.902 --> 41:34.469
Pride, the balcony.

41:41.110 --> 41:42.911
It's gonna be okay.

41:47.886 --> 41:49.628
Barrett!

41:51.987 --> 41:54.003
You need to come out.

41:54.745 --> 41:56.972
No one needs to get hurt today.

41:57.075 --> 41:58.590
Dwayne.

41:58.756 --> 42:01.526
That's not for either
one of us to decide.

42:02.386 --> 42:04.706
Our path's already been chosen.

42:04.964 --> 42:07.745
Just need to see
how it plays out.
