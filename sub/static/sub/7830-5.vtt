10:48.898 --> 10:51.567
"Adam and Eve must have been
the first bookkeepers.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.944
They invented
the loose leaf system."

10:54.028 --> 10:56.238
(raucous laughter)

10:56.322 --> 10:57.657
(chuckling)

10:57.740 --> 10:58.949
If there's
a bad bookkeeping joke

10:59.033 --> 11:00.785
I haven't heard it.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.578
ANNOUNCER:
<i>It's 11:00.</i>

11:02.662 --> 11:04.622
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>where your children are?</i>

11:04.705 --> 11:07.291
I told you
last night, no!

11:07.375 --> 11:09.669
Where is Bart anyway?

11:09.752 --> 11:11.796
His dinner's getting
all cold and eaten.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.427
Bart, where are you?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.304
Come on!

11:20.388 --> 11:22.598
I have to be up at 6:00 a.m.
to swipe Flanders' newspaper.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.600
What the--

11:24.684 --> 11:26.894
"President Eisenhower
celebrates

11:26.977 --> 11:28.896
"40th wedding anniversary.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.857
Not pictured, Mrs. Eisenhower."

11:31.941 --> 11:32.858
I'm sorry.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.527
This is all my fault.

11:34.610 --> 11:35.945
Bart was filling in--

11:36.028 --> 11:38.531
I don't care if he
was filling for Mel Zetz.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.700
He's my son and I don't
want him working...

11:40.783 --> 11:43.661
so... late... that...

11:43.744 --> 11:44.954
Oh, I agree.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.747
Kids need rules
and boundaries.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.750
Yes, everyone
loves rules.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.502
It's so tough to be
a parent these days

11:51.585 --> 11:54.255
what with all the gangs
and the drugs...

11:54.338 --> 11:56.549
Oh, yeah, drugs.
You gotta have drugs.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.175
Hey, he didn't pay the cover.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.428
Oh, Bart,
he's your father.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.595
We'll comp him
tonight.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.847
Start a tab
tomorrow.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.394
Oh, I hope I didn't miss
the floor show.

12:08.477 --> 12:09.729
-Nope.
-Is Roxanne back?

12:09.812 --> 12:10.896
Yup.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.148
Did she, uh,
get my flowers?

12:12.231 --> 12:14.650
-She did.
-I--

12:14.734 --> 12:15.943
Hello, Bart.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.778
Hello,
Principal Skinner.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.865
This is the National Air
and Space Museum, isn't it?

12:20.948 --> 12:22.450
(doorbell rings)

12:24.910 --> 12:27.913
Uh, this isn't going to be
about Jesus, is it?

12:27.997 --> 12:29.915
All things
are about Jesus, Homer.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.500
Except this.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.712
Your son has been working
in a burlesque house.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.381
Principal Skinner
saw him with his own eyes.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.467
That's true,
but I was only in there

12:39.550 --> 12:41.510
to get directions on how
to get away from there.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.387
Helen,
as a responsible parent

12:43.471 --> 12:45.514
I was already
well aware of that.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.017
Homer, I'm as permissive
as the next parent.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.311
I mean, just yesterday
I let Todd buy some red hots

12:50.394 --> 12:52.146
with a cartoon
devil on the box

12:52.229 --> 12:54.398
but you can't possibly
think it's appropriate

12:54.482 --> 12:56.358
for your ten-year-old son

12:56.442 --> 12:57.943
to work in
a burlesque house.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.654
Oh, no?
Well, if Homer Simpson

13:00.738 --> 13:03.115
wants his ten-year-old son
working in a burlesque house,

13:03.199 --> 13:05.242
then Homer Simpson's
ten-year-old son

13:05.326 --> 13:07.661
is going to work
in a burlesque house!

13:07.745 --> 13:08.704
That...

13:08.788 --> 13:09.789
(nervous laugh)

13:09.872 --> 13:11.540
Hi.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.460
Now, Marge, you're gonna hear
a lot of crazy talk

13:14.543 --> 13:16.796
about Bart working
in a burlesque house...

13:20.299 --> 13:22.510
"Maison Derriere"?

13:22.593 --> 13:24.428
I can't believe
there's a place

13:24.512 --> 13:27.348
like that in our
wholesome little town.

13:27.431 --> 13:29.225
Homer, did you know it
was a burlesque house

13:29.308 --> 13:30.851
when you sent Bart
to work there?

13:30.935 --> 13:33.270
No. I only learned that
four days ago.

13:33.354 --> 13:37.024
What were you thinking sending
Bart to such an awful place?

13:37.107 --> 13:41.487
I was trying to punish him
exactly like you would.

13:41.570 --> 13:42.822
So, in a way

13:42.905 --> 13:44.657
you really dropped
the ball on this one.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.158
This is your mess

13:46.242 --> 13:48.494
and I'll be damned
if I'm gonna clean it up.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.705
(grumbles)

13:51.789 --> 13:53.582
Please come in,
Mrs. Simpson.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.918
How can I be of service?

13:56.001 --> 13:58.254
I have a favor to ask.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.964
Please shut
this place down

14:00.047 --> 14:01.799
and move away
from Springfield.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.634
Oh, honey,
you can't be serious.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.845
Springfield doesn't
want places like this.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.222
I think I know what
Springfield wants, sugar.

14:08.305 --> 14:12.351
Oh? I've lived in this town
for 37 years.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.019
I've lived here 52 years.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.063
-I'm third generation.
-Sixth.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.440
Get out of my town!

14:18.524 --> 14:21.235
Listen, darling, we're just
as much a part of Springfield

14:21.318 --> 14:24.530
as the church, the library
or the crazy house,

14:24.613 --> 14:27.950
so I think I'll stay
right here... neighbor.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.451
Is that so?

14:29.535 --> 14:32.705
Well, sleazy entertainment
and raunchy jokes

14:32.788 --> 14:36.834
will never be as popular
as sobriety and self-denial.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.419
You're about to learn

14:38.502 --> 14:40.004
the two most
dangerous words

14:40.087 --> 14:43.424
in the English language
are "Marge Simpson."

14:45.634 --> 14:47.219
It's the light
pink '87 wagon.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.014
And after visiting
the area for, uh,

14:50.097 --> 14:51.640
the past two months

14:51.724 --> 14:54.143
I have determined it is
not feasible to construct

14:54.226 --> 14:57.354
a super-train between
Springfield and Aruba.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.981
(dejected groaning)

14:59.064 --> 15:01.817
Next on the agenda is, uh...

15:01.901 --> 15:04.069
The Citizens' Committee
on Moral Hygiene.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.821
(dejected groaning)

15:08.282 --> 15:11.160
I'm here to share
my moral outrage

15:11.243 --> 15:12.703
but this time it's not about

15:12.786 --> 15:14.830
that giant inflatable
Dos Equis bottle.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.042
It's about a certain house
in our town.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.085
What's wrong with this house?
Is it the plumbing?

15:20.169 --> 15:25.841
No. It's a house of ill fame,
a house of loose ethics.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.885
Is there a building code
violation?

15:27.968 --> 15:28.928
A drainage issue?

15:29.011 --> 15:30.012
A surveying error?

15:30.095 --> 15:32.056
The house is perfectly fine.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.766
Well, then quit bad-mouthing
the house.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.893
Yeah. Leave
the house alone.

15:35.976 --> 15:39.813
Oh, geez, it's what's inside
the house that's disgraceful--

15:39.897 --> 15:42.524
Drinking, gambling
and debauchery.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.778
It's right under our noses--
A secret house

15:45.861 --> 15:47.154
of burlesque.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.864
(gasping)

15:48.948 --> 15:49.865
-Oh, my.
-MARGE: That's right.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.158
KARL: That's not good.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.619
People, this is an issue
that we as a town

15:53.702 --> 15:55.204
are strong enough to ignore.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.082
Let us give no more scrutiny
to this bawdy house

15:58.165 --> 16:00.918
and its small clientele
of loyal perverts.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.711
Oh, I'm afraid
this problem

16:02.795 --> 16:05.255
goes far beyond
Eugene and Rusty.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.508
(quiet murmuring)

16:07.591 --> 16:09.093
Marge, if you please.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.764
Julius!

16:15.015 --> 16:16.433
Clancy!

16:16.517 --> 16:18.143
CHALMERS:
Skinner?

16:18.227 --> 16:20.104
-Seymour!
-Mother...

16:20.187 --> 16:21.981
SELMA:
Patty?

16:22.064 --> 16:22.982
WOMAN:
Cletus!

16:25.693 --> 16:27.444
Oh. Uh, Barney.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.780
Clancy!

16:29.863 --> 16:31.407
Hey, come on!
You did me twice!

16:32.825 --> 16:34.868
Smithers?

16:34.952 --> 16:37.413
My parents insisted
I give it a try, sir.

16:37.496 --> 16:38.956
HELEN LOVEJOY:
Mayor Quimby!

16:39.039 --> 16:41.625
Uh, well, that could be
any mayor.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.544
I rest my case.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.797
Er, uh, well...
In light of these new facts,

16:46.880 --> 16:49.216
of which I now realize
I was largely aware,

16:49.299 --> 16:50.968
I must take action.

16:51.051 --> 16:54.304
All in favor of demolishing
our beloved burlesque house

16:54.388 --> 16:55.806
raise your hands.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.271
(Marge clears throat)

17:02.354 --> 17:04.690
Are they talking
about the bordello?

17:04.773 --> 17:07.943
No, the burlesque house,
so just keep your mouth shut.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.991
(mob grumbling)

17:14.074 --> 17:17.953
Oh, there's no justice
like angry-mob justice.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.080
I'm going to burn
all the historic memorabilias.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.124
I'm going to take
me home a toilet.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.709
Well, there'd
better be two.

17:25.627 --> 17:26.879
(doorbell rings)

17:26.962 --> 17:28.297
BELLE:
<i>Who is it?</i>

17:28.380 --> 17:29.631
Uh, it's an angry mob,
ma'am.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.800
Could you step outside
for a twinkle

17:31.884 --> 17:33.302
while we knock down
your house?

17:33.385 --> 17:34.720
<i>Just a minute.</i>

17:41.393 --> 17:44.521
Stand aside, you degenerate,
two-bit proprietress.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.066
Don't you call me that.
I'm an entrepreneuse.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.860
Oh, shut up. You're wasting
valuable smashing time.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.361
(yelling)

17:53.489 --> 17:56.075
(glass shattering)

17:56.158 --> 17:57.743
Dad, we can't let
this happen to Belle.

17:57.826 --> 17:58.827
Do something.

17:58.911 --> 17:59.828
Don't you worry, son.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.248
My friends!

18:03.332 --> 18:04.374
Stop!

18:06.126 --> 18:07.753
Please hurry.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.839
Sure. We could tear
this house down--

18:10.923 --> 18:12.174
-(yelling)
-Yeah! Oh, yeah!

18:12.257 --> 18:15.177
No! My friends, stop!

18:15.260 --> 18:16.428
Let me finish.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.722
We could tear it down

18:18.806 --> 18:23.852
but we'd be tearing down
a part of ourselves.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.820
ALL: No! No!

20:38.904 --> 20:40.072
Stop! Stop!

20:40.155 --> 20:41.281
What are you
doing, Marge?

20:41.365 --> 20:42.658
Didn't you
hear the song?

20:42.741 --> 20:44.826
No. I had to go rent
the bulldozer.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.954
Well, we all
changed our minds.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.830
Yeah. Now we
love the house.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.041
What about the sleaze
and the depravity?

20:51.124 --> 20:53.168
It was a very
convincing song, Marge.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.212
Mm-hmm. There were
kicks and everything.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.506
Hmm... Can you sing it again?

20:57.589 --> 20:59.132
I'm sorry.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.176
It really was one of those
spur-of-the-moment-type things.

21:01.260 --> 21:05.013
Well, I also have
a song to sing.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.058
Don't make up your mind
until you hear both songs.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.768

Uh... sorry.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.988
Thanks a lot, Marge.

21:21.071 --> 21:24.366
That was our only
burlesque house.

21:24.449 --> 21:27.327
I do love it
when you drop by, Marge.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.205
Next time, why don't we
get together at your house.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.999
I'm so sorry.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.792
How can we ever
make this up to you?

21:33.875 --> 21:35.919
Oh, there's a way, Mom.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.800
So, Twiggy, I hear you
and your husband Woody

21:41.883 --> 21:43.051
just had a baby.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.678
What did you name him?

21:44.761 --> 21:45.887
Chip.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.055
(drum sting)

21:47.139 --> 21:48.765
Take it off!

21:48.849 --> 21:50.642
All right, Dad, you've
been warned. Let's go.

21:50.726 --> 21:51.810
Hey...

21:51.893 --> 21:53.061

-Easy.
