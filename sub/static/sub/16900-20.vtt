00:01.294 --> 00:02.294
And this is the two-bedroom.

00:02.461 --> 00:04.713
Wow.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.634
By the hammer of Thor!

00:08.800 --> 00:10.260
Can you afford this place?

00:10.427 --> 00:11.261
Yeah.

00:11.428 --> 00:12.930
I can with this new promotion.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.932
It's...a lot more money.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.601
Like "get away with murdering
my first wife" kind of dough.

00:17.768 --> 00:18.720
Mm-hmm.

00:18.894 --> 00:22.021
See, now, I could hang
a huge TV right there.

00:22.183 --> 00:24.908
You could get that third humidifier
you always dreamed about.

00:25.061 --> 00:25.779
Slow down.

00:25.949 --> 00:28.023
I'm not ready
to move my humidifiers yet.

00:28.198 --> 00:29.192
Oh, I know.

00:29.366 --> 00:32.240
I don't mean right away.
I just meant...someday.

00:32.406 --> 00:32.900
Hopefully.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.821
Yeah, good.
Someday.

00:34.995 --> 00:37.451
But for now,
I got a great job.

00:37.626 --> 00:39.413
A kick-ass girlfriend.

00:39.588 --> 00:41.042
I deserve an apartment to match.

00:41.206 --> 00:43.662
And I think this is definitely it.

00:43.838 --> 00:45.173
I'll take this one too.

00:45.338 --> 00:48.961
My son Ahmed will keep
his motorcycles here.

00:49.137 --> 00:52.461
Oh! Thanks for coming.

00:53.598 --> 00:56.132
Oh...ooh.

Lemon!

01:17.787 --> 01:19.583
Oh, welcome back.
How was Paris?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.740
Paris was fantastic.

01:21.918 --> 01:25.622
We stayed in this little place in the Seventh
that Phoebe knew about.

01:25.798 --> 01:27.252
I'm Phoebe.
We've met before.

01:27.428 --> 01:29.841
Jack proposed to me outside your office.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.173
I have hollow bones.

01:31.348 --> 01:32.003
Like a bird.

01:32.176 --> 01:32.591
Yes, no.

01:32.758 --> 01:33.762
I remember you, hi.

01:33.928 --> 01:34.922
Hi.

01:35.097 --> 01:36.382
Well, I should go.

01:36.558 --> 01:40.302
We've just won the auction rights to
a fantastic collection of Chinese erotica.

01:40.478 --> 01:42.432
Pick out a good one for me.

01:42.607 --> 01:43.851
Careful.

01:44.028 --> 01:46.270
Bye.

01:48.988 --> 01:51.063
So...have you guys set a date?

01:51.235 --> 01:51.821
Yes, we have.

01:51.986 --> 01:52.731
May 18th.

01:52.907 --> 01:55.362
That's Bianca's wedding date.
It was my idea.

01:55.536 --> 01:56.320
That's fast.

01:56.497 --> 01:58.243
Well, there are no rules in love, Lemon.

01:58.417 --> 02:00.993
My...Princeton roommate
did it the right way.

02:01.168 --> 02:02.782
Dated his college girlfriend for 13 years,

02:02.958 --> 02:04.543
and the marriage
didn't last eight months.

02:04.708 --> 02:08.002
And now he's a post-op transgender.

02:08.175 --> 02:09.122
Will you look at that?

02:09.295 --> 02:13.052
Phoebe reset my watch to New York time
while I was sleeping on the plane.

02:13.218 --> 02:15.010
She really is a wonderful girl.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.302
And I do hope the two of you
get to know each other better.

02:17.478 --> 02:18.433
Okay, sure.

02:18.597 --> 02:19.763
Why don't you have a girls' day out?

02:19.935 --> 02:20.843
Take Jenna with you.

02:21.017 --> 02:22.300
You could have lunch, go shopping.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.971
Here...take my gold card.

02:26.275 --> 02:27.311
Ooh, it's heavy.

02:27.486 --> 02:29.310
It's...made of gold.

02:29.488 --> 02:31.943
Ah. Wow.

02:33.235 --> 02:34.483
Turned me down, Liz Lemon.

02:34.657 --> 02:35.072
Who?

02:35.238 --> 02:36.152
The damn bank.

02:36.326 --> 02:38.701
I need a loan to finance
my Thomas Jefferson movie.

02:38.865 --> 02:40.702
It's gonna be at least $30 million

02:40.865 --> 02:42.410
with all the Claymation
sex scenes in it.

02:42.575 --> 02:43.783
And they didn't want to pay for that?

02:43.956 --> 02:44.661
It's all right.

02:44.835 --> 02:46.503
The movie's just a small part of my plan.

02:46.668 --> 02:47.160
What plan?

02:47.335 --> 02:49.210
The Tracy Jordan comeback.

02:49.377 --> 02:52.133
I'm doing a comedy tour,
a Michael McDonald cover album.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.343
Ah, boy, I don't know, Tray.

02:53.508 --> 02:55.752
I don't think of you
as a great multitasker.

02:55.928 --> 02:56.842
What can I do?

02:57.016 --> 02:58.473
I'm on my grind.

02:58.638 --> 03:01.721
I'm gonna have so much money,
my grandkids are gonna play lacrosse.

03:01.897 --> 03:04.853
Lacrosse, Liz Lemon.

03:05.016 --> 03:05.893
"I'm on my grind."

03:06.067 --> 03:08.770
Is that a...

03:09.275 --> 03:09.851
There he is.

03:10.027 --> 03:12.021
The Floydster!

03:12.197 --> 03:13.902
I heard you were going in
for your final interview.

03:14.067 --> 03:14.732
I wanted to put in a good word.

03:14.906 --> 03:16.403
All right, well,
that should put me over the top.

03:16.575 --> 03:17.941
Oh, you're already there.

03:18.118 --> 03:19.653
The other candidate is an outsider.

03:19.827 --> 03:21.533
And we like to promote from within.

03:21.706 --> 03:25.032
Plus, his name is Alan Garkel.

03:25.207 --> 03:29.082
You're never gonna lose a job
to a guy named Garkel.

03:29.257 --> 03:31.872
Did someone say my name?

03:32.045 --> 03:35.962
Nah, you're not gonna beat that.

03:37.058 --> 03:40.260
Well-played, Garkel.

03:42.807 --> 03:46.260
Because Carl's trying to kill the gophers,
but then the explosion knocks Danny's ball

03:46.438 --> 03:47.893
into the hole,
and he wins the tournament.

03:48.067 --> 03:50.481
And that is the plot of Caddyshack.

03:50.645 --> 03:51.772
I can't believe
you've never seen it.

03:51.946 --> 03:53.902
Classic.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.402
Oh! Jeez, I'm sorry.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.732
Oh, you like Wagner?

03:56.907 --> 03:58.861
No, I like Elmer Fudd.

03:59.036 --> 04:00.322
 Kill da wabbit

04:00.498 --> 04:02.911
 Kill da wabbit

04:03.077 --> 04:08.082
My parents were both poets, so I...
don't really get it.

04:08.245 --> 04:11.752
So this has just been
a whirlwind romance for you.

04:11.917 --> 04:14.711
Just a...whirl of wind.

04:14.886 --> 04:16.713
Look, I know what you must be thinking.

04:16.887 --> 04:19.589
What kind of a woman
marries a man she hardly knows?

04:19.767 --> 04:21.053
What is she after?

04:21.228 --> 04:21.760
No, no, no.

04:21.925 --> 04:22.842
I don't think that.

04:23.017 --> 04:25.551
I completely get it,
why you would wanna marry Jack.

04:25.726 --> 04:28.351
I'd marry Jack in a heartbeat.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.060
I would have a three-way
with two Jacks.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.232
You need to cool it.

04:32.395 --> 04:35.060
Let's face it-- at our age,
we can't afford to waste any time.

04:35.236 --> 04:37.062
Mm-hmm.

04:37.238 --> 04:38.612
Floyd and I have been dating for a month.

04:38.777 --> 04:42.903
Do you think I should be mad
that I don't have a ring?

04:43.076 --> 04:45.411
Wow, how Sex in the City are we right now?

04:45.578 --> 04:51.253
I'm Samantha, you're Charlotte,
and you're the lady at home who watches it.

04:51.418 --> 04:54.251
Dude, check it out.

04:54.415 --> 04:55.793
Bill Cosby hates you.

04:55.966 --> 04:56.713
What?

04:56.887 --> 04:57.583
Look here.

04:57.758 --> 05:01.921
"Tracy Jordan has made a career
out of exploiting black stereotypes.

05:02.098 --> 05:05.012
He is an embarrassment
to African-Americans."

05:05.186 --> 05:06.342
Why would he say that?

05:06.515 --> 05:09.263
What have I ever done
to embarrass black people?

05:09.437 --> 05:10.680
Uh...

05:10.856 --> 05:12.141
Why are we doing this?

05:12.318 --> 05:14.311
Because the Jets lost!

05:14.488 --> 05:16.272
Mr. Jordan, your manager called.

05:16.445 --> 05:18.813
Temple University has canceled
your stand-up appearance.

05:18.986 --> 05:22.403
And Michael McDonald is denying permission
to record any of his songs.

05:22.576 --> 05:27.991
In other words: Oh, Tracy,
you can't Use any of my songs.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.540
This is no coincidence.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.622
What are you talking about?

05:32.795 --> 05:34.040
The bank loan.

05:34.304 --> 05:35.871
The Michael McDonald situation.

05:36.043 --> 05:37.298
Temple University.

05:37.461 --> 05:40.179
Dr. Cosby is sending a message!

05:40.349 --> 05:41.751
They're out to destroy me!

05:41.928 --> 05:43.881
Who is?

05:44.055 --> 05:47.260
The Black Crusaders.

05:54.185 --> 05:56.271
Oh, Floyd would love this one.

05:56.445 --> 05:57.441
Yikes!

05:57.606 --> 06:00.060
If I was gonna spend $600
to have my boobs pinched,

06:00.236 --> 06:03.733
I would have gone to that fundraiser
at the Clintons' house.

06:03.907 --> 06:06.610
Come on, that was solid!

06:06.787 --> 06:09.160
Liz, I'm concerned
I'm boring Jack sexually.

06:09.326 --> 06:09.822
No, no.

06:09.995 --> 06:10.623
No...ugh.

06:10.786 --> 06:14.371
We've only just got engaged, and already our
intercourse is infrequent and unimaginative.

06:14.548 --> 06:15.953
Phoebe, I'm really not that kind of girlfriend.

06:16.128 --> 06:17.960
I would gladly pick you up at the airport.

06:18.126 --> 06:21.420
In Paris, he fell asleep
on top of me.

06:21.597 --> 06:24.421
I mean, I just want to make him happy.

06:24.598 --> 06:26.421
If he's happy,
I'm happy, you know?

06:26.598 --> 06:27.172
Mm.

06:27.347 --> 06:29.382
Do you have that credit card?

06:29.557 --> 06:31.181
Thanks.

06:31.355 --> 06:33.933
Hi, I'll take everything.

06:34.107 --> 06:35.471
Liz, can you help me?

06:35.647 --> 06:36.313
Yes, ma'am.

06:36.485 --> 06:38.940
I don't know you,
but I will help you.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.063
Damn it.

06:40.236 --> 06:41.191
I can't believe it.

06:41.367 --> 06:41.982
Garkel?

06:42.156 --> 06:42.690
I'm sorry.

06:42.867 --> 06:43.860
I'm just sick of it.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.532
I'm so tired of this city.

06:45.696 --> 06:49.493
I am so tired of the rat race.

06:50.538 --> 06:51.491
Fellas!

06:51.668 --> 06:53.372
You gotta keep it down, okay?

06:53.538 --> 06:54.540
I got work in the morning.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.620
Molnya is looking very strong tonight.

06:56.797 --> 06:59.500
Mr. Debarber, come on.

06:59.676 --> 07:00.172
Fine.

07:00.337 --> 07:03.130
20 across the board.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.880
Yeah, you gotta talk to your landlord
about that rat race.

07:06.058 --> 07:07.050
That is my landlord.

07:07.218 --> 07:07.802
Oh.

07:07.976 --> 07:09.091
Yeah.

07:09.265 --> 07:11.221
Maybe I just need to go out of town
for a little while.

07:11.395 --> 07:13.353
That's a good idea.
Vermont is always nice.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.011
Or the Bahamas.

07:15.186 --> 07:17.222
I was thinking of Cleveland.

07:17.398 --> 07:18.563
That is also a place.

07:18.738 --> 07:20.730
I just haven't been home in a long time.

07:20.896 --> 07:22.230
We need to search your bag.

07:22.408 --> 07:22.810
Ugh.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.402
Of course they do.

07:25.578 --> 07:27.613
You know, I dream
about moving back to Lakewood.

07:27.787 --> 07:30.200
Or maybe even Shaker Heights.

07:30.368 --> 07:31.950
Big Creek Parkway.

07:32.117 --> 07:35.333
Sending the kids
to St. John Bosco's, you know.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.873
Maybe even cheering on
the tribe at the Jake.

07:38.048 --> 07:40.660
This dream, this
is way down the road, right?

07:40.836 --> 07:42.210
Yeah. Yeah.

07:42.378 --> 07:44.462
Three, maybe four years.

07:44.636 --> 07:46.502
What's this fungus cream for?

07:46.678 --> 07:47.250
All right, that's it.

07:47.428 --> 07:48.133
Show's over.

07:48.308 --> 07:49.301
Gimme that.

07:49.465 --> 07:52.132
Let's just walk.

07:52.308 --> 07:53.930
So how long do you see yourself
living in New York?

07:54.095 --> 07:55.263
Well, like, forever.

07:55.435 --> 07:56.221
At least, I did.

07:56.397 --> 07:57.970
Really?

07:58.145 --> 08:01.772
You wanna end up like that?

08:02.986 --> 08:03.602
No.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.651
I'm gonna be like her.

08:04.815 --> 08:08.733
Oh, there is nothing
like New York in the spring!

08:08.908 --> 08:10.073
It's--oh!

08:10.246 --> 08:12.202
Ooh.

08:12.365 --> 08:13.031
All right, come on.

08:13.207 --> 08:14.570
This is the capital of the world.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.120
The culture, the div--

08:16.286 --> 08:17.370
Ugh!

08:17.537 --> 08:18.120
Uck!

08:18.297 --> 08:18.791
You all right?

08:18.955 --> 08:21.120
He spit in my mouth!

08:21.298 --> 08:22.791
Ugh!

08:22.968 --> 08:24.370
Let's go to Cleveland.

08:24.546 --> 08:27.212
Oh, blurgh!

08:29.466 --> 08:31.801
Hey, Frank told me
about that Cosby thing.

08:31.976 --> 08:32.842
That is harsh.

08:33.017 --> 08:34.130
Harsh?
I'm done.

08:34.308 --> 08:37.261
The Black Crusaders want
to make an example out of me.

08:37.434 --> 08:38.640
I'm not gonna ask you
who that is.

08:38.817 --> 08:41.932
The Black Crusaders are a secret group
of powerful black Americans.

08:42.105 --> 08:45.063
Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey
are the chief majors.

08:45.237 --> 08:48.691
But Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell,
and Gordon from Sesame Street,

08:48.865 --> 08:49.650
they're members too.

08:49.826 --> 08:52.990
And they meet four times a year
in the skull of the Statue of Liberty.

08:53.155 --> 08:55.070
You can read about that on the interweb.

08:55.308 --> 08:57.701
Ah, well, it must be true
if it's on the "interweb."

08:57.877 --> 08:59.082
Right, uh-huh.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.040
Make fun of me all you want, Liz Lemon.

09:01.208 --> 09:05.670
Do you know they'll ruin anybody who they
think are making black people look bad?

09:05.835 --> 09:07.793
They tanked 50 Cent's movie.

09:07.965 --> 09:09.843
The blew out Terrell Owens' ankle.

09:10.008 --> 09:14.801
And they canceled Eddie Murphy's Oscar,
'cause he, uh, ran out on Scary Spice.

09:14.976 --> 09:16.760
And now they after Tracy Jordan!

09:16.938 --> 09:20.723
Tracy, I know the movie is important to you,
and you're stressed out and everything,

09:20.896 --> 09:22.812
but keep it together, okay?

09:22.987 --> 09:23.772
The cleanup continues.

09:23.936 --> 09:26.103
Fortunately, there were no injuries.

09:26.278 --> 09:29.483
Tracy Jordan, the Black Crusaders
are coming for you.

09:29.656 --> 09:30.981
We'll have more on the weather coming up...

09:31.157 --> 09:35.453
Man, I wish somebody else had seen that.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.992
Hi.

09:37.165 --> 09:38.871
Look what Phoebe got me.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.243
Golf clubs?

09:41.415 --> 09:43.163
Not just golf clubs.

09:43.336 --> 09:46.121
These clubs once belonged
to President Gerald Ford.

09:46.298 --> 09:48.383
Oh, wow.

09:48.545 --> 09:50.631
So what do you think of Phoebe?

09:50.795 --> 09:53.510
Oh, well...
we had fun.

09:53.675 --> 09:56.432
And, uh, Phoebe bought
some bonkers underwear.

09:56.598 --> 09:57.801
So have fun with that tonight.

09:57.976 --> 09:59.223
Well, not tonight.

09:59.396 --> 10:01.512
Uh, may I?
Thank you.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.022
Not tonight unfortunately.

10:03.186 --> 10:07.061
She's, uh, speaking in a seminar
up at Columbia.

10:07.237 --> 10:13.942
And as much as I would like to attend,
I haven't been above 72nd Street in over a decade.

10:14.118 --> 10:15.821
Well, I'm glad you're happy.

10:15.998 --> 10:17.361
Ha!

10:17.537 --> 10:20.201
It's all Phoebe.

10:20.375 --> 10:23.740
We have an attraction that can
only be described as...

10:23.918 --> 10:25.453
wolf-like.

10:25.628 --> 10:26.503
Lupine.

10:26.667 --> 10:27.463
Okay.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.213
I am so exhausted.

10:29.377 --> 10:31.633
Paris was, to borrow a phrase,

10:31.798 --> 10:33.630
just...bonkers.

10:33.805 --> 10:36.802
Yes, Phoebe said.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.940
Do you cover him?

10:52.776 --> 10:54.361
Phoebe isn't going to Columbia tonight.

10:54.538 --> 10:57.361
She had me call a car to take her
to this address downtown.

10:57.538 --> 10:59.281
So what do you want me to do,
go spy on her?

10:59.457 --> 11:00.571
For Mr. Donaghy's sake.

11:00.746 --> 11:02.571
I know you have
your doubts about this.

11:02.747 --> 11:03.623
I can see it in your eyes.

11:03.786 --> 11:05.120
It's weird, right?

11:05.296 --> 11:06.661
Then again, all relationships are weird.

11:06.835 --> 11:08.831
I mean, my boyfriend Floyd
wants to go to Cleveland.

11:09.005 --> 11:10.330
Ah, thank God.

11:10.508 --> 11:13.751
Mr. Donaghy's office.

11:17.596 --> 11:20.680
Just a quick look.

11:23.936 --> 11:27.270
By the hammer of Thor!

11:33.276 --> 11:35.441
Ew.

11:49.377 --> 11:50.583
Jack, I have to talk to you.

11:50.757 --> 11:51.921
Is this about the Tracy situation?

11:52.085 --> 11:52.122
No.

11:52.295 --> 11:52.961
Then it'll have to wait.

11:53.138 --> 11:54.132
What Tracy situation?

11:54.296 --> 11:55.340
I tried to call you.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.880
He set fire to a cardboard
cutout of Al Roker,

11:58.056 --> 11:59.722
and now he's locked himself
in his dressing room.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.090
Oh, brother.

12:01.266 --> 12:03.221
Tracy!

12:03.397 --> 12:03.801
Come out.

12:03.976 --> 12:05.721
Nobody is trying to get you.

12:05.897 --> 12:09.102
Have you seen the cover
of this month's Oprah magazine?

12:09.278 --> 12:13.600
It's an anagram for
"Outlaw Sour Tray."

12:13.856 --> 12:16.522
Who taught Tracy about anagrams?

12:16.698 --> 12:19.110
I'm gonna call Dr. Spaceman.

12:19.287 --> 12:21.113
Hey, car's downstairs.
You ready to go?

12:21.287 --> 12:22.151
Um...

12:22.325 --> 12:24.410
The Black Crusaders
are trying to get rid of me.

12:24.575 --> 12:26.531
They want me to disappear like Coolio.

12:26.708 --> 12:27.830
Coolio is around!

12:27.995 --> 12:28.740
What--

12:28.916 --> 12:30.753
Would you also prescribe
something for Tracy

12:30.915 --> 12:33.710
which would keep him awake during sex?

12:33.875 --> 12:34.581
Oh, great.

12:34.755 --> 12:35.792
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

12:35.968 --> 12:38.193
Thanks.

12:38.387 --> 12:40.802
Let's get outta here.

12:40.968 --> 12:43.381
What hot spot's got
the hippest groove?

12:43.556 --> 12:44.013
Welcome to Cleveland.

12:44.185 --> 12:48.352
Where all the real gone daddies move

12:51.148 --> 12:53.982
What smells so good?

12:54.148 --> 12:55.481
Cleveland.

12:55.658 --> 12:58.440
Where the jet set swing with hepcats

12:58.617 --> 13:01.191
Shop at Higby's,
then we'll hit the Flats

13:01.368 --> 13:02.443
Excuse me.

13:02.617 --> 13:03.782
Are you a model?

13:03.955 --> 13:04.492
No.

13:04.666 --> 13:05.991
Oh, you are so skinny.

13:06.167 --> 13:08.622
You really should eat something.

13:08.787 --> 13:12.160
I say, Cleveland, hello

13:13.258 --> 13:14.580
Yeah

13:14.755 --> 13:17.843
New York and Paris just don't have

13:18.008 --> 13:21.263
The sights you see and you can have

13:21.426 --> 13:22.302
Ugh.

13:22.467 --> 13:25.131
Would you like to pet
a real police horse?

13:25.306 --> 13:27.552
Chef Boyardee was born here

13:27.726 --> 13:29.970
Yes!

13:36.407 --> 13:37.813
Oh, ladies first.

13:37.987 --> 13:39.821
I say Cleveland, hello

13:39.988 --> 13:45.820
Hi, I'll have two hotdogs,
a pretzel with extra melted cheese...

13:46.155 --> 13:46.700
Hiya.

13:46.866 --> 13:49.700
Ms. Lemon, this is Kenneth,
the NBC page in New York City.

13:49.876 --> 13:52.621
I hate to bother you out west,
but Tracy Jordan hasn't come to work.

13:52.796 --> 13:55.001
Kenneth, don't be so New York uptight.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.961
I'm sure he'll show up.

13:57.128 --> 13:57.580
 Look over there,

13:57.756 --> 13:59.751
I think I see a movie star

13:59.926 --> 14:02.841
 Even movie stars,
they come to Cleveland To get away

14:03.018 --> 14:03.591
 Tracy Jordan,

14:03.765 --> 14:05.093
you've gotta get away

14:05.266 --> 14:06.221
 Gotta get away,

14:06.388 --> 14:08.143
gotta get away

14:08.306 --> 14:11.100
 To Cleveland

14:11.937 --> 14:13.811
Liz...

14:13.977 --> 14:16.981
I have something important
I wanna talk to you about.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.861
The top law firm
in Cleveland wants me.

14:20.028 --> 14:22.073
And...I think
I should accept.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.033
What? Really?

14:25.196 --> 14:25.822
What's this?

14:25.995 --> 14:28.821
It's a house in the Heights
that I can afford.

14:28.996 --> 14:31.831
When did you have time
to look for jobs and houses?

14:31.996 --> 14:33.741
When you were at
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

14:33.918 --> 14:35.792
Did I tell you
I sat in ZZ Top's car?

14:35.957 --> 14:37.750
And then I had lunch
with Little Richard.

14:37.927 --> 14:40.673
And, I know
it's not TGS, but...

14:40.837 --> 14:43.051
I'm sure you can find a job
at one of the local TV stations.

14:43.218 --> 14:44.592
You sure could.

14:44.767 --> 14:49.513
We need a host
for a new cooking show on WKYC.

14:50.516 --> 14:52.802
Uh...

15:01.367 --> 15:02.613
Where have you been?

15:02.777 --> 15:03.942
Cleveland.

15:04.117 --> 15:07.072
For God sakes, Lemon,
we'd all like to flee to the Cleve.

15:07.245 --> 15:09.912
And club up down at the Flats
and have lunch with Little Richard.

15:10.078 --> 15:13.413
But we fight those urges
because we have responsibilities.

15:13.588 --> 15:14.333
What's going on?

15:14.496 --> 15:15.123
Tracy.

15:15.295 --> 15:15.911
He's missing.

15:16.087 --> 15:16.703
What?

15:16.877 --> 15:18.331
No. Kenneth, have you
tried to call Tracy?

15:18.506 --> 15:21.173
Yes, ma'am, I tried
all six of his cell phones.

15:21.336 --> 15:24.500
It's almost as if he never existed.

15:24.678 --> 15:28.341
Or maybe he's not answering.

15:28.807 --> 15:31.723
Lemon, TGS without Tracy Jordan
is basically a puppet show.

15:31.896 --> 15:33.682
You know, I'm right here.

15:33.856 --> 15:37.103
Oh, why am I doing this
when I could be happy living in Cleveland?

15:37.278 --> 15:38.391
What?

15:38.565 --> 15:39.983
Floyd and I are thinking of moving.

15:40.145 --> 15:40.893
- No, you're not.
- No, you're not.

15:41.068 --> 15:43.733
Look, every great getaway
has that moment when you want

15:43.908 --> 15:44.940
to pack it all in and stay.

15:45.116 --> 15:47.282
That's how I ended up
with a timeshare...

15:47.448 --> 15:48.780
in Port Arthur, Texas.

15:48.948 --> 15:49.743
I don't think
that's what this is.

15:49.907 --> 15:50.820
I mean, Floyd is pretty great.

15:50.996 --> 15:55.201
And, look, in Cleveland,
I'm a model.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.702
Yeah, we're all models
west of the Allegheny.

15:58.878 --> 16:00.661
I'm serious about this.

16:00.837 --> 16:01.832
Maybe you should go.

16:02.007 --> 16:03.961
I mean, your head is obviously
not in the game lately.

16:04.136 --> 16:06.300
And now you've lost Tracy.
Maybe you're burned out.

16:06.467 --> 16:07.841
What is this?

16:08.015 --> 16:10.300
This is Frank's "Hot Baby" sketch,
which is regrettable,

16:10.477 --> 16:13.180
but we have no Tracy Jordan
and a show in two days.

16:13.347 --> 16:19.220
But, hey, that's not gonna be your problem
once you move to Ohio.

16:19.777 --> 16:22.022
No, you're not.

16:22.198 --> 16:25.861
Frank, that's gonna get cut.

16:26.197 --> 16:26.902
Blurgh!

16:27.077 --> 16:28.533
Did you say anything to Jack?

16:28.695 --> 16:29.653
No, but I'm going to
if you don't.

16:29.825 --> 16:31.033
Oh, grow up, Liz.

16:31.206 --> 16:34.572
I didn't tell Jack where I was going 'cause
I didn't want him to get upset about nothing.

16:34.747 --> 16:36.330
That man was a former lover of mine.

16:36.498 --> 16:38.042
I was ending it with him, forever.

16:38.205 --> 16:41.413
Uh-huh, and are all your ex-boyfriends
rich, older gentlemen?

16:41.587 --> 16:42.920
I care about Jack.

16:43.088 --> 16:45.333
I make him a better man.

16:45.508 --> 16:47.502
You know how John Lennon was better than
the rest of the Beatles,

16:47.676 --> 16:49.880
but didn't realize it
until he met Yoko Ono?

16:50.057 --> 16:51.421
Well, I'm Jack's Yoko.

16:51.595 --> 16:52.883
You want to be Yoko?

16:53.057 --> 16:54.683
This is none of your business, anyway.

16:54.846 --> 16:55.642
I'm marrying Jack.

16:55.808 --> 16:56.970
He's everything I ever wanted.

16:57.148 --> 16:57.932
Oh, I bet he is.

16:58.108 --> 17:01.272
You don't know anything
about me, so back off!

17:01.437 --> 17:03.941
What happened to your accent?

17:04.107 --> 17:05.691
Um...

17:05.856 --> 17:07.692
I don't know what you're on about.

17:07.865 --> 17:10.942
You...daft wanker.

17:21.838 --> 17:22.500
Hello?

17:22.667 --> 17:23.661
Hello, Liz Lemon.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.001
It's me.

17:26.178 --> 17:27.460
Stacy Gordon.

17:27.635 --> 17:29.551
Tracy, where are you calling from?

17:29.717 --> 17:31.001
I can't tell you that.

17:31.178 --> 17:32.552
I'm sorry, Liz Lemon.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.933
I wanna thank you
for everything you've done.

17:35.098 --> 17:36.090
But I quit.

17:36.267 --> 17:37.682
For God's sakes, Tracy, where are you?

17:37.855 --> 17:39.262
Starting a new life.

17:39.436 --> 17:40.762
Because of the Black Crusaders?

17:40.936 --> 17:42.220
That's crazy.

17:42.397 --> 17:44.023
Tray?

17:44.185 --> 17:50.733
Damn it, Lemon, why didn't you tell me
the Black Crusaders were after Tracy?

17:52.196 --> 17:53.492
Surprisingly fast.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.822
Oh.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.793
I'm on it.

18:08.885 --> 18:11.171
I can't go to Cleveland.

18:11.345 --> 18:12.093
Hi.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.800
Hi. I'm sorry.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.220
I just, I've been thinking about this.

18:15.387 --> 18:16.262
And I think you're great.

18:16.436 --> 18:18.391
And obviously Cleveland is great.

18:18.558 --> 18:20.892
But I can't move.

18:21.058 --> 18:21.512
I know.

18:21.685 --> 18:22.472
My life is here.

18:22.648 --> 18:23.432
My friends are here.

18:23.606 --> 18:24.562
The show is here.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.773
And I've known you a month.

18:26.947 --> 18:28.273
Oh, you hate me right now, don't you?

18:28.448 --> 18:29.482
No.

18:29.657 --> 18:31.613
No, it was a crazy idea to begin with.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.113
We were on a vacation high--

18:33.286 --> 18:33.903
Exactly.

18:34.078 --> 18:34.900
It's like a drug.

18:35.078 --> 18:37.911
Right-- if the whole world
moved to their favorite vacation spots,

18:38.078 --> 18:41.031
then the whole world would live in
Hawaii and Italy and Cleveland.

18:41.206 --> 18:42.453
Totally, I mean...

18:42.625 --> 18:45.703
But just knowing that C-Town is out there
as an option for the future--

18:45.876 --> 18:47.000
it's gonna make it
so much easier--

18:47.168 --> 18:50.541
Liz... I took that job.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.210
Blurgh.

18:59.186 --> 19:00.343
Did you locate Tracy?

19:00.516 --> 19:02.803
Ugh, not yet.
I'm working on it.

19:02.977 --> 19:04.523
You know, you never answered
my question the other day.

19:04.687 --> 19:05.973
What do you think of Phoebe?

19:06.145 --> 19:08.601
Honestly, I wish I had the guts
to do what you're doing.

19:08.778 --> 19:10.402
Just...going for it.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.313
God bless.

19:12.487 --> 19:15.782
You still haven't answered my question.

19:15.945 --> 19:17.991
I...think she likes you a lot.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.453
And I think she takes care of you.

19:20.618 --> 19:23.332
And she's smart and pretty.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.543
And completely wrong.

19:25.708 --> 19:27.083
And she doesn't deserve you.

19:27.257 --> 19:30.210
I think she's weird,
and I don't like her,

19:30.375 --> 19:31.921
and her ex-boyfriend is old.

19:32.085 --> 19:33.963
And I don't even think she's British!

19:34.136 --> 19:35.460
And you shouldn't marry her, Jack.

19:35.635 --> 19:39.013
Please don't marry her!

19:40.098 --> 19:42.551
Oh, my God.

19:42.727 --> 19:46.102
Lemon, Phoebe was right.
You are infatuated with me.

19:46.275 --> 19:46.971
What?

19:47.148 --> 19:48.272
No! No, no, no.

19:48.435 --> 19:49.983
Lemon, you are a wonderful woman.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.980
And you deserve to be as happy as I am.

19:52.155 --> 19:53.692
Maybe with Floyd, right?

19:53.867 --> 19:56.652
No, don't mention Floyd.
Floyd is not happening.

19:56.825 --> 19:57.571
Floyd is moving.

19:57.737 --> 19:59.701
Floyd is moving?

19:59.866 --> 20:00.742
What did you do?

20:00.905 --> 20:01.861
What did I do?

20:02.038 --> 20:03.530
I acted like a rational adult!

20:03.708 --> 20:05.953
I didn't get engaged
to some gold digger,

20:06.126 --> 20:09.080
and then delude myself into thinking
that I could keep up with her.

20:09.256 --> 20:13.381
Yeah, Jack, I know that you fell asleep
on top of her in Paris.

20:13.548 --> 20:16.551
In Paris, France.

20:19.975 --> 20:23.303
I think you should go.

20:33.027 --> 20:37.651
Uh, Phoebe, darling,
Lemon was just leaving.
