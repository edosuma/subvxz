Hakuna Matata.

No worries!

No, no, I can't watch this,
I can't watch this.

00:15.280 --> 00:19.010
Wakanda forever!
- Yes. I like that.

Hey, is that your
momma land,

00:20.380 --> 00:21.820
that's where you're from?

00:21.820 --> 00:23.020
- It's not a real place.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.450
- Yes, it is.

00:24.450 --> 00:26.990
That's on the southern tip
of Mongolian Beef.

00:26.990 --> 00:29.060
- Mozambique!
- Yeah, yeah.

00:29.060 --> 00:30.890
- What are you doing here
at this hour?

00:30.890 --> 00:33.030
- Well, I had to get
some work done.

00:33.030 --> 00:34.560
What's all that?

00:34.560 --> 00:36.900
- Uh, night allergies.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.270
- What you allergic to,
sleep?

00:38.270 --> 00:40.370
- It runs in the family.

00:40.370 --> 00:42.140
- Okay, well, the only
thing I know

00:42.140 --> 00:44.610
cause you to stay up this late
is caffeine,

00:44.610 --> 00:49.280
a little subscription drugs,
and some knocking boots.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.680
- Add night allergies to the
list and leave me now.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.980
- MR. BROWN: Okay.

00:53.980 --> 00:56.850
Maybe you can just cry
yourself to sleep.

00:56.850 --> 01:00.450
Oh, you weren't crying,
though, it's the allergies.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.560
"Allegedly."

01:09.100 --> 01:11.270
- Do you regret coming
to America, Efe?

01:11.270 --> 01:16.700
- No, this movie--[sniffing]--
it's--it's very funny.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.040
I can't stop laughing.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.540
- Oh, okay.

01:20.540 --> 01:22.610
I can see from the
bloodshot eyes

01:22.610 --> 01:26.850
and the tissue for an
entire village.

01:26.850 --> 01:29.450
I wasn't born yesterday,
Efe.

01:29.450 --> 01:33.220
- I'm sorry, Ms. Cora.
I'm having a moment.

01:33.220 --> 01:36.260
- Well, it look like you've
had a stream of moment.

01:36.260 --> 01:38.690
- Every time I turn on
the television,

01:38.690 --> 01:41.360
I see something that reminds
me of my past,

01:41.360 --> 01:43.830
so I get happy,
then I get sad.

01:43.830 --> 01:45.230
- Let me see that remote.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.100
Let's see what we can find
right quick.

01:48.100 --> 01:50.070
Ah, there it is,
"Finding Nemo"!

01:50.070 --> 01:52.340
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
that's not Nemo,

01:52.340 --> 01:58.080
that's Bobo from "Hook, Line,
and Stinker." Oooh!

01:58.080 --> 02:02.380
It reminds me
of my Arabinrin Obi.

02:02.380 --> 02:04.950
- You mean your
Obi Wan Kenobi?

02:04.950 --> 02:07.920
- No, no, no, no,
auntie--my auntie.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.920
My friends and I would be
fish--fishing in the lagoon,

02:10.930 --> 02:15.200
she would make the best
jollof rice and peppered fish.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.960
- Oh, okay.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.570
You know, I make a mean
dirty rice and fried catfish.

02:20.570 --> 02:22.300
I can throw in some
sweet potatoes!

I'm concerned about Efe.

02:47.010 --> 02:49.210
Everything seems to
upset him.

02:49.220 --> 02:50.780
I think he's missing his
family and friends.

02:50.780 --> 02:52.580
- Oh, Cora, I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

02:52.590 --> 02:55.690
'Cause the Bible says man
should not cryeth alone.

02:55.690 --> 02:57.520
- Mr. Brown, it don't say
that nowhere in the Bible.

02:57.520 --> 03:00.660
- Somewhere.
- No. Jesus did weep.

03:00.660 --> 03:03.530
- Yep. Uh...

03:03.530 --> 03:07.130
How those allergies
coming along?

03:07.130 --> 03:09.230
- They only act up
on nights.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.670
- Oh.

03:10.670 --> 03:12.440
- Anybody want to play
a game of Go Fish?

03:12.440 --> 03:14.570
- [Efe squeals]

03:14.570 --> 03:17.540
- It's night allergies.

03:17.540 --> 03:21.610
You need to take
something for that.

03:21.610 --> 03:24.720
- Ha-ha! Ain't nothing like
Ms. Annie's catfish and chips.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.620
- [Efe squeals]

03:26.620 --> 03:29.120
- You're allergic to fish, too?

03:29.120 --> 03:31.390
- Man eaten by a giant blowfish.

03:31.390 --> 03:34.460
- [Efe crying]
- What's the matter with Efe?

03:34.460 --> 03:36.290
- I think he miss
his friends.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.500
- See, unlike him,
I don't have those issues,

03:38.500 --> 03:40.800
'cause all friends do
is borrow money,

03:40.800 --> 03:44.600
then get amnesia when it's
time to pay you back.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.970
- I ain't never did
that to you.

03:45.970 --> 03:48.540
- Then you ain't never
been my friend.

03:48.540 --> 03:50.440
- We gotta do something
to help Efe.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.280
- You know what?
That's a good idea.

03:52.280 --> 03:56.110
I bet you didn't know I have
an honorary degree from FU.

03:56.120 --> 04:00.750
- That's Fool's University
with a degree in foolology.

04:00.750 --> 04:05.560
- No, that's Flake University
dot com, thank you.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.560
I have a degree in, uh,
pathetic studies.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.430
- Did they use you
as a case study?

04:11.430 --> 04:12.960
- [laughing]

04:12.970 --> 04:14.730
- Y'all can say whatever
you wanna say,

04:14.730 --> 04:18.400
but I'ma have Efe fixed
up in no time, watch.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.870
- He's so stupid.

04:23.280 --> 04:26.540
- So, um, Mr. Ukulele.

04:26.550 --> 04:29.880
- Omowale.
You can call me Efe.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.680
- No, no, while I'm in a
professional setting,

04:32.690 --> 04:34.690
I prefer to just only
use last name,

04:34.690 --> 04:36.450
we're keeping it very
professional.

04:36.460 --> 04:39.260
Don't I look professional?

04:39.260 --> 04:41.190
Thank you.

04:41.190 --> 04:45.800
Okay, so tell me, Mr. Oklahoma,
when you wake up in the morning,

04:45.800 --> 04:50.770
do you, A, apologize
for your dragon breath,

04:50.770 --> 04:54.600
or do you, B, breathe on people
without any shame,

04:54.610 --> 04:57.770
or do you, C, tell someone
that something has died

04:57.780 --> 04:59.910
in your mouth
while you were asleep?

05:02.380 --> 05:04.010
- What are you talking about?

05:04.020 --> 05:07.750
- Okay, denial.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.320
Here's another one:
When you get angry at folks,

05:10.320 --> 05:14.590
do you, A, pimp slap
somebody,

05:14.590 --> 05:18.600
do you, B, run and slap
the first person you see,

05:18.600 --> 05:23.870
or do you, C, drop to your
knees and begin to pray?

05:23.870 --> 05:26.900
- I don't remember doing
any of those things.

05:26.910 --> 05:30.010
- Okay, forgetful.

05:30.010 --> 05:34.850
Okay, when you see someone
that has more than yourself,

05:34.850 --> 05:38.580
do you, A, wish you had it,

05:38.580 --> 05:41.890
do you, B, take it from them,

05:41.890 --> 05:46.620
or do you, C, lie?

05:46.630 --> 05:50.260
- I envy no one! Ha!

05:50.260 --> 05:52.560
- "Delusionee."

05:52.560 --> 05:56.230
Okay, Mr. Owakewa,

05:56.240 --> 05:58.540
what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna just go evaluate

05:58.540 --> 06:01.510
my evaluation of your
evaluation,

06:01.510 --> 06:03.310
and I will get back to you
as soon as possible,

06:03.310 --> 06:07.280
okay, Mr. Okunkuwunk?

06:07.280 --> 06:09.350
Thank you.

06:09.350 --> 06:12.050
Also angry.

06:12.050 --> 06:13.520
- Where's Philip?

06:13.520 --> 06:15.720
- Ooh, he should be home
soon, what's up?

06:15.720 --> 06:17.420
- Just got a call from
his teacher,

06:17.420 --> 06:19.560
apparently he is
failing chemistry.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.060
- What?

06:21.060 --> 06:22.630
- [doorbell rings]
- When he come in this house,

06:22.630 --> 06:24.860
oh, it is going down.
It's going down.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.400
- Stay calm. On three.

06:34.410 --> 06:36.970
- BOTH: One, two, three,
stay calm.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.510
- Boy, have you lost your
everlasting mind, huh?

06:39.510 --> 06:41.280
You done missed 15 assignments?

06:41.280 --> 06:42.910
- Eight--
- And ten labs!

06:42.920 --> 06:43.950
- Four.

06:43.950 --> 06:47.650
- Boy, cut me off again,
I dare you.

06:47.650 --> 06:49.450
What is wrong with you?
Huh?

06:49.460 --> 06:51.090
You know what? I'll tell
you what you can do,

06:51.090 --> 06:53.220
you can walk around this house
until you find your little mind,

06:53.230 --> 06:55.360
how about that?

06:55.360 --> 06:57.030
- I'm sorry. Yes, ma'am.

06:59.570 --> 07:01.770
- Ten labs.

07:01.770 --> 07:05.240
- If looks could kill.
- Yeah, you'd be 12 feet deep.

07:05.240 --> 07:06.640
- Twelve? You mean six?

07:06.640 --> 07:09.640
- No, no, she will kill you
twice, okay?

07:09.640 --> 07:12.010
Now, you knew about this F?

07:12.010 --> 07:13.910
- I don't want to be a chemist,
and I can make

07:13.910 --> 07:17.410
way more money being a
DingDong star.

07:17.420 --> 07:19.350
Matter of fact, I don't want
anything to do with science.

07:19.350 --> 07:21.180
It's not like when I graduate
somebody's gonna hand me

07:21.190 --> 07:24.120
a Petri dish and tell me
to watch a cell grow.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.420
- At this rate, you aren't
gonna graduate high school,

07:26.430 --> 07:27.590
and then you'll be
finding out

07:27.590 --> 07:30.390
about different kinds
of cells.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.630
What?
Gimme this.

07:32.630 --> 07:34.260
Problem right here,
this phone.

07:34.270 --> 07:36.730
You know what? Get upstairs
and put on a wife beater

07:36.740 --> 07:38.000
and some jeans,
you about to find out

07:38.000 --> 07:41.970
about some hard labor,
ding dong.

07:41.970 --> 07:43.340
- Can I at least bring a
sandwich?

07:43.340 --> 07:45.110
- No. That's my sandwich.

07:46.010 --> 07:49.780
- Okay, I've done a
analyzation on Efe,

07:49.780 --> 07:51.720
and I know exactly
what's wrong with him.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.680
- What's that?
- He got menopause.

07:54.690 --> 07:56.490
- Let me handle this my way, you
don't know

07:56.490 --> 07:57.790
what you're talking about.

07:57.790 --> 07:59.520
- It's a scientifically
proven fact

07:59.530 --> 08:01.090
that men don't go through
menopause.

08:01.090 --> 08:04.460
- Well, why do they call it
"meno-pause," then?

08:04.460 --> 08:05.900
See, the scientists don't
know nothing,

08:05.900 --> 08:07.630
we should've just asked
the lord on this matter,

08:07.630 --> 08:09.400
he knows all.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.570
- I think my fourth husband
suffered from that.

08:12.570 --> 08:13.940
Once we were on the slopes

08:13.940 --> 08:16.040
and he started stripping
on the diamond.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.910
I thought he had the hots
for me,

08:17.910 --> 08:20.540
turned out he was just having
the hots.

08:20.550 --> 08:23.480
- Mr. Vinny, I was trying
to pray with Efe,

08:23.480 --> 08:25.720
and I mentioned that our
lord and savior

08:25.720 --> 08:29.790
was a fisher of men,
and he lost it.

08:29.790 --> 08:31.560
- I got this,
I got this.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.060
- You know what?
Let me tell you something.

08:33.060 --> 08:34.660
- VINNY: Uh-huh.
- Just don't mention fish,

08:34.660 --> 08:36.060
whatever you do.

08:36.060 --> 08:37.760
- What you need to do
is watch and learn,

08:37.760 --> 08:39.500
here we go.
- Okay, alright.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.800
- Efe, my brother.
[laughing]

08:43.800 --> 08:46.270
- Poor thing
just breaking up.

08:46.270 --> 08:48.370
- Look, I heard you're going
through a little something,

08:48.370 --> 08:49.870
you know?
So me, Vinny,

08:49.880 --> 08:52.680
being the--how can I say this--
unselfish.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.210
- [Efe squeals]

08:55.210 --> 08:56.980
- You know, you know,
what I like to do

08:56.980 --> 08:58.450
when I'm going through something
like this,

08:58.450 --> 09:00.920
you know,
take it to the head.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.850
- I can't take anything
to the head.

09:02.850 --> 09:06.390
- I'm talking about, you know,
throw one back.

09:06.390 --> 09:08.860
- Throw what back
to where?

09:08.860 --> 09:12.430
- Take a sip, you know,
let's get numb!

09:12.430 --> 09:17.100
- The last time I was numb,
I got a snip, not a sip.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.670
- Numbing things is a
temporary solution

09:19.670 --> 09:23.010
for invertebrates.
Give us a second alone, huh?

09:23.010 --> 09:24.570
Come on,
give us some time alone.

09:24.580 --> 09:25.940
Come on, help us out here.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.010
- I want to see what's
gonna happen.

09:28.010 --> 09:30.880
- It seems I'm having a
bit of trouble.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.920
All my--all my loved ones have
gone.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.720
My friends, my wife...

09:35.720 --> 09:37.850
- Yes. I know exactly
how you feel.

09:37.860 --> 09:40.890
I've suffered the same losses
myself.

09:40.890 --> 09:43.930
You lose all your friends,
then your wife leaves you

09:43.930 --> 09:46.600
for some guy who knows
how to ride a bull,

09:46.600 --> 09:50.770
leaving you behind to suffer
the end of the journey alone.

09:50.770 --> 09:53.170
And then you end up in a place
with a bunch of people

09:53.170 --> 09:55.110
that you have nothing in
common with

09:55.110 --> 10:00.480
to end up in the dying process.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.850
- Tissue?
- No.

10:03.850 --> 10:07.820
But you have to run to it,
you cannot run away from it.

10:07.820 --> 10:10.550
- Yes!
How do I do that?

10:10.560 --> 10:12.190
- You have to face things
head on.

10:12.190 --> 10:12.990
- Very good.

10:12.990 --> 10:15.930
- Now look me in the eyes.

10:15.930 --> 10:17.790
Fish.
- [Efe squeals]

10:17.800 --> 10:21.160
- One fish. Two fish.
Red fish. Blue fish.

10:21.170 --> 10:25.400
Fishing, fishwhich, "The Fish
That Saved Pittsburgh"!

10:25.400 --> 10:27.300
- Way to go, Sherlock.
- Mm.

10:27.310 --> 10:30.610
Just give it some time
to work its magic.

10:30.610 --> 10:32.780
- Maybe I should analyze
you.

10:32.780 --> 10:36.210
- That's it, that's it,
I'm taking over.

10:36.210 --> 10:40.020
I know what Efe needs,
he needs a woman's touch.

10:40.020 --> 10:42.920
- Oh you just be--
stop being nasty!

10:42.920 --> 10:46.560
- Not from me, I'm setting
Efe up on Silver Fox,

10:46.560 --> 10:48.830
the dating service for
seasoned singles

10:48.830 --> 10:52.860
who can still see, walk,
and talk.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.130
- The last time I went
on Silver Fox,

10:55.130 --> 10:59.140
I got something I couldn't
return, and I'm still itching.

10:59.140 --> 11:01.440
- Oh, disgusting.
- Ignorant is what you is.

11:02.770 --> 11:05.910
- Alright, so today we're
gonna use 120 grit sandpaper

11:05.910 --> 11:08.480
to lightly sand those
cabinets, alright?

11:08.480 --> 11:10.150
So what we're gonna do here,

11:10.150 --> 11:12.180
always remember when sanding,
it should be going

11:12.180 --> 11:15.850
with the wood grain,
like this. Right?

11:15.850 --> 11:17.690
And don't forget
while sanding,

11:17.690 --> 11:19.490
it should always be smooth
like butter.

11:19.490 --> 11:23.490
Or better yet, like my skin,
okay?

11:23.500 --> 11:27.260
Yeah, yep.
Just like--

11:27.270 --> 11:29.030
- Man, don't you think we
should take a break?

11:29.030 --> 11:31.400
We've been at this for hours.

11:33.570 --> 11:37.410
- Uh-huh. Yeah, that hard labor
on your ass, ain't it, boy?

11:37.410 --> 11:39.740
Mm-hmm, you can't handle it,
I knew you couldn't handle it.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.640
I knew it.

11:41.650 --> 11:43.180
You know what? Let me see
that checklist,

11:43.180 --> 11:46.550
let me see how much he's
done so far.

11:46.550 --> 11:50.290
- So far he's reupholstered
a chair,

11:50.290 --> 11:53.190
he painted the hallway wall,
detached all bathroom cabinets,

11:53.190 --> 11:55.790
drilled in upgraded hinges,
sanded them down,

11:55.790 --> 11:58.060
conditioned the wood,
I mean...

11:58.060 --> 12:02.130
- Yeah, and I'm about to
put the "staink" on it.

12:02.130 --> 12:07.370
You get it?
Stain, staink, like the "ai?"

12:07.370 --> 12:09.370
Alright never mind.
Dad, do we have some more

12:09.370 --> 12:12.740
of the 220 grit sandpaper
and wood conditioner?

12:12.740 --> 12:15.210
Also, do you know where I could
get a crane?

12:17.180 --> 12:18.950
Okay.

12:19.620 --> 12:21.250
- Man, what the hell is going
on?

12:21.250 --> 12:23.150
You're supposed to be in here
working his fingers to the bone!

12:23.160 --> 12:25.690
I need you to turn the heat up,
gotta burn him out!

12:25.690 --> 12:28.930
- Look, I'll try, alright?
But I'm falling asleep here,

12:28.930 --> 12:31.190
can I get like an energy
drink?

12:31.200 --> 12:33.960
Or just let me take a cat nap
like right there.

12:36.540 --> 12:38.000
- How's this?

12:38.000 --> 12:42.140
"My name is Efe Omowale,
I'm a self-starter

12:42.140 --> 12:44.770
who loves fishing
and playing board games."

12:44.780 --> 12:47.040
- Oh woman, you about to
put me in a comma.

12:47.050 --> 12:48.880
- It's "coma,"
not "comma."

12:48.880 --> 12:50.450
- Whatever it is,
you about to put me in it.

12:50.450 --> 12:53.820
- REGINALD: Here, let me,
I've got to see this.

12:53.820 --> 12:56.220
Now how's this?

12:56.220 --> 13:01.760
"To whom it may concern,
a rose by any other name

13:01.760 --> 13:04.790
shall smell as sweet"...
- Good lord.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.300
That's why you
still single, Reggie.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.930
Now type this, type this,
type this. Here you are.

13:08.930 --> 13:12.040
I got it, I got it, I got it.

13:12.040 --> 13:17.470
"Aquarius.
And my name is Efe.

13:17.480 --> 13:22.980
And I like a woman who likes
everyone and everybody."

13:22.980 --> 13:24.850
Type that up!
- MR. BROWN: Shut up.

13:24.850 --> 13:26.550
That's whack!
- Put that down, man.

13:26.550 --> 13:28.320
- I really don't
want to do this.

13:28.320 --> 13:31.050
This is not how you pick
a wife.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.920
- You have an arrangement deal?

13:32.920 --> 13:36.090
- Like "Married at
First Glance."

13:36.090 --> 13:38.490
- No, I couldn't do that.
I mean, what if she's ugly?

13:38.500 --> 13:41.000
What if she's real ugly?
Then we'd have to change

13:41.000 --> 13:44.800
the show to "Hell No,
She Gotta Go." [laughs]

13:44.800 --> 13:49.610
- No. I picked my dear wife.

13:49.610 --> 13:50.840
Now she's gone, too.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.210
- [computer makes chime sound]

13:52.210 --> 13:54.080
- Oh shoot!
We got some action!

13:54.080 --> 13:56.850
- Ooh, ooh, yeah.
- We got some action.

13:56.850 --> 13:58.980
- VINNY: Wait, what we got?

13:58.980 --> 14:01.220
- [all groan]
- Nah, nah.

14:02.650 --> 14:04.020
Oh, damn.

14:04.020 --> 14:05.920
- [all groan]
- ANASTASIA: Oh, hell no.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.120
- VINNY: No, no,
uh-huh, uh-huh.

14:08.130 --> 14:10.130
- I can't imagine having all
these pretty women on there,

14:10.130 --> 14:13.400
and don't nobody want you.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.530
- [Efe squeals]

14:18.540 --> 14:21.100
- Hey, what did y'all do?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.070
- I was trying to help him.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.140
- Mr. Brown, you know--
y'all come on, come on,

14:25.140 --> 14:26.910
come in here. I got an idea.
I got an idea.

14:26.910 --> 14:29.010
I think it may work.
You know, since Efe

14:29.010 --> 14:31.050
is missing his Motherland.
- Uh-huh.

14:31.050 --> 14:33.450
- I say we bring his Motherland
here.

14:33.450 --> 14:35.180
- So does that come with
curvy African dancers

14:35.190 --> 14:37.690
in loin cloths?
[humming]

14:37.690 --> 14:39.120
- No.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.760
Good idea, Cora,
good idea!

14:41.760 --> 14:43.290
- [applause and
indistinct chatter]

14:43.300 --> 14:45.560
- Alright, so this what
we gonna do...

14:46.530 --> 14:48.530
- Oh, here he come y'all,
here he come, here he come.

14:48.530 --> 14:50.070
Okay, okay.

14:50.070 --> 14:53.540
- [Cora yells tribal chant]

14:53.540 --> 14:54.970
- What is all this?

14:54.970 --> 14:59.680
- [struggling to
read Swahili]

14:59.680 --> 15:03.980
- [mumbling]
- [speaking Swahili]

15:03.980 --> 15:06.220
You're trying to say--
[speaking Swahili]

15:06.220 --> 15:07.150
- [all start pronouncing it
correctly]

15:07.150 --> 15:09.690
- Which means "welcome."

15:09.690 --> 15:14.420
- [banging drum]

15:14.430 --> 15:18.630
- Brother. Brother, brother,
brother! Brother!

15:18.630 --> 15:21.970
Beats the drum,
don't beat up the drum.

15:21.970 --> 15:23.970
- Efe, Efe, Efe, Efe,

15:23.970 --> 15:27.040
we have some of your
homeland favorites.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.570
- And we stayed away from
the F-word.

15:30.580 --> 15:33.580
- Did we? 'Cause we still
got a fool in the room.

15:33.580 --> 15:38.410
- No!
The F is for fish!

15:38.420 --> 15:40.920
- No, no!

15:40.920 --> 15:44.790
- See? My method worked. Hmm?

15:44.790 --> 15:47.090
- You all didn't need
to do this.

15:47.090 --> 15:48.730
- Yes, we did,
'cause you was crying

15:48.730 --> 15:50.590
like a little old girl.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.560
"Why, what is the meaning?
I am so"--

15:53.570 --> 15:56.200
- Mr, Brown, no, no,
we know you were missing

15:56.200 --> 15:59.670
your home, so we wanted
to make you feel at home.

15:59.670 --> 16:02.070
- Oh, oh...

16:02.070 --> 16:04.470
I feel...

16:04.480 --> 16:07.780
Hot! I mean, is it only me, but
is it real hot in here?

16:07.780 --> 16:10.510
- See? Hot flashes!
He got menopause! I told--

16:10.520 --> 16:13.780
- No! Vinny had the idea
to turn up the heat

16:13.790 --> 16:19.520
so it would replicate
the humidity of Africa.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.360
- You would.

16:21.360 --> 16:26.330
- This--this is all very nice,
thank you.

16:26.330 --> 16:28.560
- CORA: You're welcome.
- But I must tell you,

16:28.570 --> 16:31.200
I didn't grow up in a jungle!
- CORA: What?

16:31.200 --> 16:33.370
- I been telling you people,
stop looking at TV

16:33.370 --> 16:35.340
and saying, "This is Africa,
this is Africa."

16:35.340 --> 16:38.240
I grew up in a city! Uh.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.280
We didn't have this
bush all over the place.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.010
Somebody needs to go and turn
on the air conditioner

16:43.010 --> 16:44.950
before we die of dehydration.

16:44.950 --> 16:47.880
Now what is a tiger doing here?
- What?

16:47.890 --> 16:50.190
- There's no tiger in Africa!
- Oh!

16:50.190 --> 16:53.260
- I didn't have all these bush
in my--uh, in my house.

16:53.260 --> 16:55.160
- Well, we're sorry--
- This bush,

16:55.160 --> 16:57.530
I did not grow up in a pack!
- We didn't--we're sorry.

16:57.530 --> 17:00.600
- Oh, I'm going to turn on the
air conditioner.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.870
- [all yelling at once]
- Remove that tiger!

17:03.870 --> 17:06.070
- CORA: We're just trying
to make you feel at home!

17:06.070 --> 17:09.610
- [all pleading with Efe]

17:09.610 --> 17:11.110
- Let them wait.

17:11.110 --> 17:14.240
La, la, la, la--[coughs]

17:17.050 --> 17:20.180
- What do you mean he
likes hard labor?

17:20.190 --> 17:23.420
- Baby, he has been going
and going all day.

17:23.420 --> 17:25.050
He might be on something.

17:25.060 --> 17:26.790
- Well, I'll be his pusher.
I got a whole list

17:26.790 --> 17:29.230
of things for him to do.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.400
- Like what?

17:33.400 --> 17:37.330
- My new blinds need--
- Need to be hung. Done.

17:37.340 --> 17:38.700
- The trim
on the bathroom floor--

17:38.700 --> 17:41.370
- Freshly painted.

17:41.370 --> 17:45.110
- Philip, darling, thank
you for hanging my mirror

17:45.110 --> 17:49.450
on the ceiling,
I absolutely love it.

17:52.050 --> 17:54.920
- See? He actually likes
handy work.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.550
And he's good at it, I don't
know where he got it from.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.060
- And what's wrong with that?

17:59.060 --> 18:01.190
My third husband was a very
handy man.

18:01.190 --> 18:03.760
He died cleaning my gutter.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.630
- Key word, "died."

18:06.630 --> 18:09.770
- Lindor! Lindor!

18:09.770 --> 18:12.770
Hey, Lindor,
wake up, man!

18:12.770 --> 18:16.210
Come here.

18:16.210 --> 18:19.210
Did you give him the additions
I added to the list?

18:19.210 --> 18:24.410
- Every...last one
of them.

18:24.420 --> 18:27.120
He even added a few
of his own.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.050
- Yeah, for my Y.D.I. posts.

18:29.050 --> 18:31.250
- You mean D.I.Y.,
do it yourself?

18:31.260 --> 18:34.820
- No, I call it Y.D.I.,
"you do it."

18:34.830 --> 18:36.760
Hey, guys, now we about
to start building

18:36.760 --> 18:39.060
that pimped out birdhouse.

18:39.060 --> 18:40.600
So when the bird lands on it,

18:40.600 --> 18:42.770
it's gonna start playing
hip-hop.

18:42.770 --> 18:44.500
- Whoa.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.240
- Hey, I don't think you guys
need me around here anymore,

18:47.240 --> 18:49.770
so I'm gonna head home
and turn in early.

18:49.770 --> 18:51.110
Thank you for having me.

18:51.110 --> 18:54.240
- Yo, where is my assistant?

18:54.250 --> 18:57.580
It's so hard to get
good help around here.

18:57.580 --> 18:58.680
- Coming.

18:59.880 --> 19:04.590
- Hey, did I tell you all Philip
fixed my coo-coo clock?

19:04.590 --> 19:06.320
- Alright now,
this has gone too far.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.760
Too far!
Coo-coo clock?

19:08.760 --> 19:10.190
- What?

19:10.200 --> 19:11.790
- Who wants their kid to
flunk out of school

19:11.800 --> 19:13.460
to pursue hard labor?

19:13.460 --> 19:16.130
- Yeah, a college degree is
the key to success, Mr. Brown.

19:16.130 --> 19:17.430
- Says who?

19:17.440 --> 19:19.040
- Says any job that doesn't have
you

19:19.040 --> 19:20.600
working paycheck to paycheck.
- Tcha.

19:20.610 --> 19:23.170
- Okay now, look, college
ain't for everybody.

19:23.170 --> 19:25.610
- Okay, well as for me and
my house--

19:25.610 --> 19:27.840
- Okay, first of all,
this ain't your house,

19:27.850 --> 19:30.210
'cause I'm paying most of
the stuff around here,

19:30.220 --> 19:32.010
I'm just saying.
- Ah.

19:32.020 --> 19:34.620
- Now look, I didn't go to
like a regular college.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.790
You can have every degree
in the world you want,

19:36.790 --> 19:40.420
but if you don't know the
real true value of hard work,

19:40.430 --> 19:42.560
you'll wind up like y'all:
broke.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.090
- He's a black man in America,

19:44.100 --> 19:45.830
he'll need a degree to compete,
hear?

19:45.830 --> 19:47.500
- LEAH: Thank you.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.470
- I know we gotta work harder,
and we gotta be better,

19:49.470 --> 19:52.300
but he gotta be well-rounded,
he gotta be a man

19:52.300 --> 19:56.110
of many, many skills.
Kind of like myself.

19:56.110 --> 19:58.670
Thank you. Thank you so much, of
skills.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.410
- College gives you options,
alright?

20:00.410 --> 20:02.310
Now, if he grows up

20:02.310 --> 20:04.510
and wants to be a birdhouse
builder one day,

20:04.520 --> 20:06.180
that's fine.
But that degree?

20:06.180 --> 20:07.750
That's something to
fall back on,

20:07.750 --> 20:09.320
and that's what's important.
- MR. BROWN: Right.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.690
- Well, whether or not
he decides

20:10.690 --> 20:12.660
to go to college or not,
he'll decide that

20:12.660 --> 20:15.560
at the appropriate time.
Right now, he needs to pass

20:15.560 --> 20:17.690
this chemistry class.
- MR. BROWN: That's true.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.460
I'm telling y'all,
the boy good.

20:19.460 --> 20:20.960
And he's smarter than y'all
think he is.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.430
- Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys,

20:22.430 --> 20:24.070
Lil' Jeezy just liked my
Y.D.I. posts.

20:24.070 --> 20:25.470
- LEAH: Hmm.

20:25.470 --> 20:27.100
- I'm about to be a
DingDong star!

20:27.110 --> 20:30.510
- Alright now, I'm glad he
liked your post and everything.

20:30.510 --> 20:32.110
I don't know how you got
this phone back,

20:32.110 --> 20:36.450
but first you're going to finish
that chemistry homework, okay?

20:36.450 --> 20:39.480
- LINDOR: Yes. Yes!
So that means I can go home?

20:39.480 --> 20:41.380
- PHILIP: I'll see you bright
and early tomorrow morning!

20:41.390 --> 20:45.290
- LEAH: Get out of here.
- Run, boy.

20:45.290 --> 20:47.490
- I think he might be slow like
his daddy.

20:47.490 --> 20:51.290
- [doorbell rings]
