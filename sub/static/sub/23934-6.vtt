and you get
a free trip to Florida.

17:42.472 --> 17:44.977
‐ You know, there's several
guys who are a lot older

17:44.977 --> 17:46.564
than me
floating around the office.

17:46.564 --> 17:48.192
‐ And they're gonna get
their dates as well.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.737
But this week is for you.

17:49.737 --> 17:51.574
‐ Things are pretty busy
this week.

17:51.574 --> 17:54.245
‐ It's mandatory.

17:57.251 --> 18:00.257
‐ All right.
I can visit Space Mountain.

18:00.257 --> 18:02.220
‐ Whatever works for you.

18:06.896 --> 18:08.525
‐ It's good talking to you.

18:08.525 --> 18:10.779
Welcome to New York.
Congrats on the promotion.

18:10.779 --> 18:12.407
See you at the end of the week.

18:12.407 --> 18:14.704
‐ John.

18:14.704 --> 18:17.710
I appreciate the gift.
I really do, but I don't smoke.

18:17.710 --> 18:19.714
You'll get more use
out of these than I will.

18:25.642 --> 18:28.021
‐ I'm not replacing these
with a heart‐shaped box

18:28.021 --> 18:30.067
of chocolates, if that's
what you're looking for.

18:30.067 --> 18:34.451
‐ Understood. I don't eat
much chocolate anyway.

18:34.451 --> 18:36.037
‐ [under breath]
I bet you don't.

18:36.037 --> 18:38.668
‐ And John.
Those aren't Cubans are they?

18:38.668 --> 18:42.300
'Cause last I checked, we still
have an embargo with Castro.

18:42.300 --> 18:45.222
‐ No clue.
I was re‐gifting.

18:58.958 --> 19:00.503
‐ So, the good news for y'all,

19:00.503 --> 19:02.841
given that you've passed
that 20‐year mark,

19:02.841 --> 19:06.306
given that you're coming up
on year 25‐‐yay‐‐

19:06.306 --> 19:08.268
is that you're moving
from the possibility

19:08.268 --> 19:11.734
of half‐pay retirement
into three‐quarters pay,

19:11.734 --> 19:13.947
which is as high
as you're gonna get.

who's almost done packing?

19:22.296 --> 19:24.133

19:24.133 --> 19:26.639
‐ Oh, you shut up.
You know for what.

19:26.639 --> 19:28.475
And I'm gonna get there
in New York City

19:28.475 --> 19:30.856
and I'm gonna break out my
stash of Victoria's Secret,

19:30.856 --> 19:34.237

19:38.161 --> 19:40.040
You're disgusting.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.336
Don't you pretend
you don't know who this is.

19:42.336 --> 19:44.507
Don't you pretend you
haven't been crying yourself

19:44.507 --> 19:48.140
to sleep every night just
waiting for me to get there.

19:48.140 --> 19:49.935
I hope you're clearing
space in your dresser

teeny, teeny tiny, Johnny.

19:56.908 --> 19:58.536
‐ Darling, listen,
I got you a sweet apartment

19:58.536 --> 19:59.830
for the time being.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.876
‐ You what?

20:01.876 --> 20:03.503
I thought I was
moving in with you.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.924
‐ No, no. Not just yet.
Not right now.

20:04.924 --> 20:06.677
I've got some linguists
staying with me.

20:06.677 --> 20:09.140
‐ You what?
‐ Some linguists.

20:09.140 --> 20:11.061
Doing some translating.

[clears throat]

20:34.440 --> 20:36.319

20:50.514 --> 20:52.393
Security.
I need to talk to security.

20:52.393 --> 20:53.855

Can I ask your room?

20:53.855 --> 20:55.817
‐ Now.
‐ Yes, sir.

20:55.817 --> 20:58.321
Um, yes, we need someone
at the front desk right away.

20:58.321 --> 21:00.492
Okay, thank you.

21:04.459 --> 21:07.758
‐ Three hours. It's out
of my hands for three hours.

21:07.758 --> 21:09.970
‐ Okay.

21:09.970 --> 21:12.058
‐ Found it in a dumpster
around back.

21:12.058 --> 21:14.897
‐ So what's missing?

21:14.897 --> 21:17.986
‐ Uh, cash. 500 bucks.
Cigar cutter.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.823
‐ The gold one?
‐ Yeah.

21:19.823 --> 21:22.495
‐ And what about
the classified papers?

21:22.495 --> 21:25.794
‐ Uh, all there.
There‐‐

21:25.794 --> 21:28.549
But...
‐ What?

21:30.385 --> 21:33.851
‐ Nothing. It...It‐‐it seems
like they weren't messed with.

21:33.851 --> 21:36.272
It seems like...

21:36.272 --> 21:37.859
simple robbery.

21:37.859 --> 21:39.696
‐ But there's no way
to tell for sure.

21:39.696 --> 21:41.282
‐ No.

21:45.332 --> 21:47.461
So...

21:53.390 --> 21:55.394
Do I tell him?

21:55.394 --> 21:57.816
‐ Um, John. I...

21:57.816 --> 21:59.736
I'm an English Professor.
I'm not‐‐

21:59.736 --> 22:01.657

You're a logical thinker.

22:01.657 --> 22:03.786
Help me out.

22:06.876 --> 22:08.754
‐ Okay.

22:10.842 --> 22:13.180
[exhales slowly]

22:13.180 --> 22:15.810
I think there are two issues.

22:15.810 --> 22:19.568
The first is the moral one.
You broke the rules.

22:19.568 --> 22:24.118
So you decide whether it's
important to turn yourself in.

22:24.118 --> 22:27.041
The second issue‐‐
what if something happens

22:27.041 --> 22:30.172
as a result of the documents
being read?

22:30.172 --> 22:34.932
They weren't taken,
but they might have been read.

22:34.932 --> 22:36.977
I don't know what's in them,

22:36.977 --> 22:40.652
but I assume they're classified
for a reason.

22:44.242 --> 22:45.787
Am I right?

22:48.375 --> 22:50.797
John?

22:50.797 --> 22:53.803
‐ [distressed breathing]

23:06.578 --> 23:10.502
‐ John. Thanks for coming in.

23:10.502 --> 23:12.339
Go ahead, Mike.

23:16.389 --> 23:19.646
‐ We dusted the entire case,
inside and out.

23:19.646 --> 23:23.320
Several distinct, identifiable
fingerprints on the exterior,

23:23.320 --> 23:26.200
including yours, Mr. O'Neill,
your secretary's,

23:26.200 --> 23:28.789
two members
of the hotel security staff,

23:28.789 --> 23:31.587
and one other we didn't have
in the database.

23:31.587 --> 23:33.089
As for
the classified documents,

23:33.089 --> 23:34.885
we found two sets of prints‐‐

23:34.885 --> 23:38.809
yours and your secretary's.

23:38.809 --> 23:41.565
‐ I looked at the forensics
and the criminal report,

23:41.565 --> 23:43.485
and we feel it's safe to assume

23:43.485 --> 23:45.447
that this is a simple case
of robbery.

23:45.447 --> 23:49.623
‐ Oh. Oh...
[chuckles]

23:49.623 --> 23:52.378
Oh, thank you.
Oh...[sniffs]

23:52.378 --> 23:54.256
[exhales]
All right, all right.

23:54.256 --> 23:55.802
Well, I hope we can...

23:55.802 --> 23:58.390
hope we can put this to bed
now and move on.

23:58.390 --> 24:01.270
Keep it internal,
within the New York Office.

24:08.368 --> 24:10.038
‐ John...

24:10.038 --> 24:12.669
can you tell us what happened
a few months ago

24:12.669 --> 24:15.298
with your Palm Pilot?

24:15.298 --> 24:16.718
‐ Excuse me?

24:16.718 --> 24:18.221
‐ It's come to our attention

24:18.221 --> 24:19.975
that it was out
of your possession

24:19.975 --> 24:21.937
for a period of time
and that it was returned to you

24:21.937 --> 24:23.566
by a D. C. transit cop.

24:23.566 --> 24:25.360
‐ Who brought it
to your attention?

24:25.360 --> 24:27.197
‐ That's not important.

24:27.197 --> 24:29.368
‐ It's important to me.
It's my personal device.

24:29.368 --> 24:30.705
It's none of your business

24:30.705 --> 24:32.374
whether it was out
of my possession.

24:32.374 --> 24:34.295
‐ I think it's fairly clear,
that given what was

24:34.295 --> 24:36.550
in your briefcase, you're
not terrific at separating

24:36.550 --> 24:39.890
the professional
from the personal.

24:39.890 --> 24:42.311
Mike's gonna have
to inspect it,

24:42.311 --> 24:44.900
make sure there's
no classified contacts,

24:44.900 --> 24:48.239
determine whether anything
was electronically copied.

24:55.462 --> 24:57.216
‐ Have fun.

25:01.516 --> 25:04.313
You done with this?

25:04.313 --> 25:06.652
‐ Yes, sir. I am.
‐ You sure‐‐you sure?

25:06.652 --> 25:08.071
‐ Yes, sir.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.557
‐ Nice shoes, man.
What the fuck?

25:21.557 --> 25:24.061
‐ Boss wasn't crazy about
what I was wearing before.

25:24.061 --> 25:27.150
‐ Ferragamos, dude?
For moving furniture?

25:27.150 --> 25:29.029
‐ They're weirdly comfortable.

25:29.029 --> 25:31.535
‐ Tell me about it,
I got six pair.

25:33.539 --> 25:35.375
‐ And I was working today.

25:35.375 --> 25:37.379
I didn't have time to change

25:37.379 --> 25:39.843
into my designer track suit
and Air Pippens.

25:39.843 --> 25:42.557
‐ Oh, shit. You bustin' on me,
you little bitch?

25:42.557 --> 25:44.101
Finally get a day off Langley,

25:44.101 --> 25:46.523
you bustin' my chops
about my clothes?

25:46.523 --> 25:48.527
‐ No, it's a good look.
Works for you.

25:48.527 --> 25:50.280
‐ You're fucking right it does.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.825
And they're Pippen 2s,
you cocksucker.

25:51.825 --> 25:53.829
‐ Oh, my God, you guys,
thank you so much.

25:53.829 --> 25:55.541
You're the greatest.
It's one flight up.

25:55.541 --> 25:57.294
On the right hand side.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.797
Johnny was supposed to be here.
‐ We got it, Sheri.

25:58.797 --> 26:00.216
‐ I don't know where he is.
‐ It's all good.

26:00.216 --> 26:02.597
‐ [softly] He's here?
‐ [softly] Yeah.

26:07.690 --> 26:09.401
‐ [high pitched squeal]
John!

26:09.401 --> 26:11.865
[laughing] Oh, you're here.

26:11.865 --> 26:14.370
You're here. [squeals]
‐ Yeah, baby.

26:14.370 --> 26:15.956
[both laughing]
Oh, I missed you.

26:15.956 --> 26:18.837
I missed you, I missed you.
Oh, I miss‐‐

26:18.837 --> 26:20.758
I missed you so much.

26:20.758 --> 26:22.720
You're not even tan,
weren't you in Florida?

26:22.720 --> 26:24.683
‐ Uh, yeah, yeah.
‐ God, I missed you.

26:24.683 --> 26:26.728
How are you?
‐ I'm perfect.

26:26.728 --> 26:30.569
Everything's perfect.
Especially now.

the second catcher

26:35.705 --> 26:37.082
Hey, turn this bullshit off,
will you?

26:37.082 --> 26:38.251
We got the Mets playing.

26:38.251 --> 26:39.879
‐ You're in Manhattan, Gordo.

26:39.879 --> 26:41.675
We watch the Yankees
in Manhattan.

26:41.675 --> 26:43.344
‐ You tell him, Elaine.

26:43.344 --> 26:45.181
‐ Get yourself to Flushing,
you want the Mets.

26:45.181 --> 26:47.144
‐ Yeah, I might just go to
Flushing, cheaper beers there,

26:47.144 --> 26:48.772
that's for sure.
‐ But then of course,

26:48.772 --> 26:51.611
you walk outside,
you're in Flushing.

26:51.611 --> 26:54.283
[gentle rock music playing]

26:54.283 --> 26:57.122
[indistinct conversation]

26:57.122 --> 26:59.544
‐ I thought you said
his girlfriend's name was Liz?

26:59.544 --> 27:02.967
‐ The one I met was named Liz.

27:02.967 --> 27:05.639
‐ Are they still together?
‐ [muttering] No...

27:05.639 --> 27:08.979
‐ What does that mean?
‐ It means I work with the guy.

27:08.979 --> 27:11.192
I don't question
his personal life.

27:13.029 --> 27:14.949
‐ You spend most of your time
with him.

27:14.949 --> 27:16.745
You travel with him.
‐ Yeah, Heather.

27:16.745 --> 27:19.249
I love these guys.
I'd trust them with my life.

27:19.249 --> 27:21.420
But we don't‐‐we're
not the same.

27:21.420 --> 27:24.301
We don't all want
the same things.

27:24.301 --> 27:25.638
‐ So tell me.

27:25.638 --> 27:29.102
‐ Tell you what?
‐ Tell me what you want.

27:29.102 --> 27:31.357
‐ [softly] This.

27:31.357 --> 27:33.361
‐ A blonde girl?
‐ That blonde girl.

27:33.361 --> 27:35.448
‐ Not too many of those
in Beirut?

27:35.448 --> 27:37.912
‐ Not too many Arabs
in small town Ohio.

27:37.912 --> 27:40.208
‐ So we're both exotics?

27:40.208 --> 27:41.878
‐ I'm attracted
to the difference.

27:41.878 --> 27:44.091
I can admit it.

27:44.091 --> 27:46.638
‐ Okay.
[chuckles softly]

27:46.638 --> 27:49.351
‐ But that's not what really
draws me in.

27:49.351 --> 27:51.606
‐ What draws you in?

27:51.606 --> 27:54.152
‐ Where we connect.

27:54.152 --> 27:56.240
‐ Where's that?
‐ [chuckles]

27:57.200 --> 27:59.204
Here...

27:59.204 --> 28:02.002
and here...

28:02.002 --> 28:03.880
and there.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.968
‐ [whack]
‐ [laughs]

28:05.968 --> 28:07.345
‐ Nah, I'm telling you,
I miss it.

28:07.345 --> 28:08.724
‐ Really?
‐ All the time.

28:08.724 --> 28:10.143
‐ Upstate New York?
‐ Yeah.

28:10.143 --> 28:12.105
‐ What the hell is there
to do up there?

28:12.105 --> 28:14.527
‐ What is there to do?
Well, I‐‐I used to fish.

28:14.527 --> 28:16.155
I mean, there's
a beautiful stream

28:16.155 --> 28:17.825
down the hill from my house.

28:17.825 --> 28:20.664
I'd camp on the weekends.
‐ Like out in the woods?

28:20.664 --> 28:22.459
‐ Yeah, out in the woods.
‐ Like sleeping on the ground

28:22.459 --> 28:24.171
in the woods?
‐ Yeah.

28:24.171 --> 28:25.758
What?
You've never gone camping?

28:25.758 --> 28:28.012
‐ No, buddy, I have not.
‐ Well, I will take you

28:28.012 --> 28:29.641
camping some time.
‐ No, mm, no, Floyd.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.352
‐ You're gonna love it.
‐ No, I'm from Queens.

28:31.352 --> 28:33.314
We don't do woods.

28:37.364 --> 28:39.368
‐ I guess they think
