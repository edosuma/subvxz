I feel like I already know you.

01:11.670 --> 01:12.959
Sir?

01:12.960 --> 01:14.419
You enlisted in '93.

01:14.420 --> 01:17.379
Rose from infantry to rangers
to special forces.

01:17.380 --> 01:21.789
In '05, you joined the agency

01:21.790 --> 01:24.079
scored in the top
10% of your class,

01:24.080 --> 01:26.669

01:29.040 --> 01:32.289

And to answer your question,

01:43.830 --> 01:46.829
I know all this because
I'm the one who selected you.

01:46.830 --> 01:50.209
Well... thank you, sir.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.289

For this assignment,
I need my best.

Outside of Malajat
last month,

02:01.380 --> 02:05.119
the Taliban intercepted a
shipment of Stinger missiles,

02:05.120 --> 02:07.749
which was subsequently used
in a Taliban offensive.

02:07.750 --> 02:10.419
The transport was
a classified op.

02:10.419 --> 02:14.419
Our job is to find out how
the Taliban knew about it.

02:14.420 --> 02:16.459
We have any ideas?

02:16.460 --> 02:17.829
Name's Brent Tomlinson.

02:17.830 --> 02:19.669
He's an Army
military advisor

02:19.670 --> 02:23.119
who had advance knowledge of the
shipment's schedule and payload.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.749
We think the Taliban
paid him off?

02:24.750 --> 02:26.539
Could be.

02:26.540 --> 02:28.709
They're well funded with
Saudi money via Qatar.

02:28.710 --> 02:30.829
(Stanton) Maybe they gave
him some of that money.

02:30.830 --> 02:33.079
That's what we need you
to find out.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.459
And if they did?

02:35.460 --> 02:37.830
Then you're to handle it
in the appropriate way...

Agency exposure.

02:44.420 --> 02:46.119

become a sole proprietor.

How was your lunch with
Dr. Campbell and her parents?

05:02.710 --> 05:04.499
It was a bit rocky
at first.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.669
By the end, I think
I was growing on them.

05:06.670 --> 05:09.459

personally relate to.

05:09.460 --> 05:13.209
So things are going well
between the two of you?

05:13.210 --> 05:16.879
Well enough. Iris still
has a lot of questions.

05:16.880 --> 05:20.079
- Be cautious in your answers.
- I intend to be.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.459
Otherwise, I think it's good
that you're attempting to have

05:22.460 --> 05:25.289
a more normal life.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.379

I mean, if the Machine
is open,

05:57.540 --> 05:59.879
why not just ask why
it's sending us a number?

05:59.880 --> 06:03.829
Because, Mr. Reese, although
the Machine has become reliable

06:03.830 --> 06:05.379
in the delivery of the numbers,

06:05.380 --> 06:07.419
it is still frequently
unreliable

06:07.420 --> 06:10.379
in the processing and delivery
of other information.

06:10.380 --> 06:14.039
Case in point, it also
sent me this number.

23:24.220 --> 23:26.269
Over the next few years,
I only saw him

23:26.270 --> 23:28.639
around the holidays,
if at all.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.059
It was always the same
conversation.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.599
He'd ask me about school,

23:31.600 --> 23:34.639
and I'd pretend to be
interested in the Army.

23:34.640 --> 23:37.810
Truth was, we hardly
knew each other anymore.

23:40.810 --> 23:45.139
So your brother
was killed in action?

23:45.140 --> 23:47.219
The major who notified us
said that Paul

23:47.220 --> 23:50.519
died heroically in
the service of his country.

23:50.520 --> 23:51.929
Wouldn't say more than that.

23:51.930 --> 23:55.019
Paul's job was classified.

23:55.020 --> 23:58.099
I never cared what Paul did
for the Army.

23:58.100 --> 24:04.390
I just... wanted to know
what happened to him.

24:07.810 --> 24:09.889
After a few years
at the firm,

24:09.890 --> 24:13.309
I was in a position
to find out.

24:13.310 --> 24:15.889

military files?

24:15.890 --> 24:18.179
Yes, okay.
A couple of times.

24:18.180 --> 24:24.349
But... it felt like my last
chance to know my brother,

24:24.350 --> 24:26.350
who he was.

24:28.310 --> 24:30.769
Is that crazy?

24:30.770 --> 24:33.099
No.

24:33.100 --> 24:36.179

to lose someone,

24:36.180 --> 24:40.019
to want to know why.

24:40.020 --> 24:44.719
Well, all I learned was,
Paul was no hero.

24:44.720 --> 24:47.809
Why do you say that?

24:47.810 --> 24:51.979
He was under investigation
for treason.

24:51.980 --> 24:53.350
Treason?

24:56.220 --> 24:58.479
Do you still have access to
the photos you took of his file?

24:58.480 --> 24:59.980
Yeah.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.479
Those goons might have
taken my cell phone

25:03.480 --> 25:08.179
but not before I uploaded
everything to the cloud.

25:08.180 --> 25:11.269

for the Pentagon

25:11.270 --> 25:13.219
as an intelligence officer.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.599
It's after that, the part
about the investigation.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.889
He was in Afghanistan
as a military advisor,

25:18.890 --> 25:20.809
where the CIA suspected

25:20.810 --> 25:23.770
he was behind a stolen
weapons shipment.

25:27.770 --> 25:30.219
But why would a Pentagon
intelligence officer

25:30.220 --> 25:34.809
be acting as
a military advisor?

every day I'm out there?

26:31.480 --> 26:35.179

chooses to repay me?

36:49.330 --> 36:50.919
The malware
is replicating itself

36:50.920 --> 36:53.499
and overwriting
the laptop's existing code.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.749
It's working
towards something.

36:56.750 --> 36:59.119
I still think you're
taking an enormous risk.

36:59.120 --> 37:04.419
Yes. Our only option
is to take risks,

37:04.420 --> 37:07.619
big ones, if we want
any chance of finding Shaw

37:07.620 --> 37:10.039
or a way to defeat Samaritan.

37:10.040 --> 37:13.169
We have to be willing to do
whatever it takes now,

37:13.170 --> 37:16.710
or we've already lost.

37:18.710 --> 37:21.920
It's no risk,
no reward, Harry.

37:38.460 --> 37:40.619
Hello, Beale.

37:40.620 --> 37:43.379
Must be losing
your touch.

37:43.380 --> 37:45.119
I made you
three blocks back.

37:45.120 --> 37:46.999
[chuckling]
Hell, I know.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.579
I was enjoying the walk.

37:49.580 --> 37:52.919
So where's
your friend Duncan?

37:52.920 --> 37:54.959
He took a vacation.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.999
Not that it matters to you,

37:57.000 --> 37:58.789
'cause you're gonna
forget about him.

37:58.790 --> 38:01.209
And why would
I do that?

38:01.210 --> 38:02.789
Because if anything
happens to Duncan,

38:02.790 --> 38:04.459
my associate and I
will make sure

38:04.460 --> 38:08.669
the details about Operation
Desert Rain go public.

38:08.670 --> 38:10.919
It'll end some careers.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.750
Might even see
a few prosecutions.

38:16.250 --> 38:17.709
So you're saying you and I
are going to have

38:17.710 --> 38:20.119
to trust each other again?

38:20.120 --> 38:23.919
Suppose I am.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.879
If all this was about
the kid needing

38:25.880 --> 38:29.499
the truth about his brother,
why not just give it to him?

38:29.500 --> 38:32.919
Duncan wanted to know
how Paul died,

38:32.920 --> 38:36.039
but what he needed was to
believe his brother was a hero

38:36.040 --> 38:38.880
so he could let it go.

38:40.880 --> 38:44.829
You were always good at doing
what needed to be done.

38:44.830 --> 38:48.749
Glad to see some things
haven't changed.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.709
But a lot has.

38:50.710 --> 38:53.499
It's a brave new world
out there.

38:53.500 --> 38:56.669
Needs people like us
more than ever.

38:56.670 --> 38:58.499
That's not a good thing.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.879
It's neither good nor bad.

38:59.880 --> 39:02.789
Just the way it is.

39:02.790 --> 39:05.209
We didn't make
the world like this.

39:05.210 --> 39:08.619
Didn't we?

39:08.620 --> 39:11.879
I'll be leaving your name
out of my report.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.379
As far as the Agency
is concerned,

39:14.380 --> 39:16.669
you're still dead.

39:16.670 --> 39:19.420
Why would you do that?

39:21.420 --> 39:23.879
Might be because you could've
killed me the other night

39:23.880 --> 39:25.709
but you didn't.

39:25.710 --> 39:28.789
Or maybe I like knowing
you're out there,

39:28.790 --> 39:30.879
a ghost,

39:30.880 --> 39:33.210
still doing what needs
to be done.

39:48.750 --> 39:51.789
How'd you know
it had a false bottom?

39:51.790 --> 39:54.619
I didn't.

39:54.620 --> 39:55.879
Then why'd you shoot him?

39:55.880 --> 39:58.169
He was justifying
too much for someone

39:58.170 --> 39:59.749
who still believed
in the mission.

39:59.750 --> 40:02.419
He thought the country
owed him.

40:02.420 --> 40:04.670
Of course he took
the money.

40:06.670 --> 40:09.919
You know why Beale really picked
you over the other recruits?

40:09.920 --> 40:12.329
You saying it wasn't
my test scores?

40:12.330 --> 40:13.709
[chuckles quietly]

40:13.710 --> 40:15.789
It was where you
came from.

40:15.790 --> 40:19.499
You had no family,
at least no real family.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.539
And after losing
your adoptive mother,

40:21.540 --> 40:23.079
you were on your own.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.329
Beale knew that you'd give
everything to the Agency,

40:25.330 --> 40:29.539
because you didn't have anyone
or anything to go back to.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.669
Except the girlfriend,

40:31.670 --> 40:34.789
and you didn't hesitate
to walk away from her.

40:34.790 --> 40:36.959
Only because I had to.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.879
That's right,

40:38.880 --> 40:41.419
because we don't get
normal lives,

40:41.420 --> 40:44.419
and you can't miss
what you never had.

40:44.420 --> 40:46.329
That's why Beale picked us

40:46.330 --> 40:50.119
and why we're
so good at our jobs.
