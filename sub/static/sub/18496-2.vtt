- Do you want to do this?
- [Dulcinea] Maybe jiggle the handle?

could maybe not drain

No.

So, he must be The One
from The Great Prophecy.

07:22.776 --> 07:26.279
This means he has incredible inner power,
and I will drain this power

07:26.363 --> 07:28.448

Did you not see how I defeated
the Bloodwolf?

10:28.711 --> 10:32.132
What is a Bloodwolf?
That sounds disgusting.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.343
Not important.

10:35.426 --> 10:36.886
- Huh?
- Where'd he go?

Or what? You'll lock us in a cage?

11:00.451 --> 11:04.122
Don't make me come up there.
I have to keep Puss happy in his dream

11:04.205 --> 11:06.291
or else he'll wake up
and break my spell and...

11:06.749 --> 11:08.126
Why did I say all of that out loud?

11:08.209 --> 11:09.460
[gasps]

11:09.586 --> 11:11.045
Now, quiet all of you!

11:12.088 --> 11:14.340
We have to find a way to wake Puss up!

11:14.674 --> 11:18.052
Ooh, we should feed him onions.
They always keep me up at night.

11:18.928 --> 11:19.762
Or...

11:20.430 --> 11:21.389
[Artephius] Hmm.

Anything? What can we do?

Do you hear that? It is almost
as though someone is calling me.

[Malaranea] Uh, I don't hear...

11:56.799 --> 12:00.053
...hear anything. Ignore those voices,

<i>[chanting continues]
Puss in Boots! Puss in Boots!</i>

12:57.276 --> 13:03.491
This is like a dream come true.
Wait a minute. A dream come true.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.910
[Malaranea's voice] Puss in Boots.

13:06.995 --> 13:11.374
Oh, there's my Pussycat.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.794
I've been looking for you.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.048
Okay. Hello.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.676
Is there something wrong with your voice?

13:25.221 --> 13:28.766
[clears throat, normal voice] The only
thing wrong is that I haven't told you

13:28.850 --> 13:30.852
how proud I am of you.

13:30.935 --> 13:35.481
You're such a fancy hero-man-cat-person,
you know that?

13:36.232 --> 13:37.859
That is oddly phrased, but...

13:37.942 --> 13:40.278
Kiss me, you frisky feline.

13:41.029 --> 13:43.072
Mm...

13:43.364 --> 13:44.699
[Dulcinea kisses]

13:45.324 --> 13:46.284
Mm...

13:46.367 --> 13:48.619
[grunts] Huh?

13:49.370 --> 13:50.621
[sighs]

13:52.665 --> 13:56.669
Oh! Hello, sleepyhead.
There, there. Just relax.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.964
That encounter with Malaranea
put you out for three days.

14:00.923 --> 14:01.758
Ay.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.094
I had the strangest dream.
You would never believe it.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.139
Well, all that is over now.
I was just worried

14:08.222 --> 14:10.266
you were gonna sleep through the big day!

14:11.517 --> 14:12.477
What big day?

14:13.478 --> 14:17.440
Our big day, silly.
We're getting married, remember?

14:17.523 --> 14:18.566
[chuckles]

14:18.649 --> 14:19.734
[gasps]

14:21.944 --> 14:24.030
If there isn't a spell
that can wake Puss up,

14:24.113 --> 14:26.199
is there a spell that can, I don't know,

14:26.282 --> 14:29.243
send me into his dream,
so I can wake him up from inside?

14:29.327 --> 14:30.661
Yes, of course.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.705
That's so easy, a baby wizard could do it.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.374
Okay, quickly. Let's do it!

14:34.457 --> 14:35.291
I'm on it!

14:36.167 --> 14:38.169
Wait, how do I get out of the dream?

14:38.252 --> 14:43.466
Oh, I guess you get out when
Puss realizes it's a dream and wakes up.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.390
[mumbles]
[wedding music playing]

14:52.850 --> 14:55.895
Till death do us part, right, Puss?

14:55.978 --> 14:57.480
[laughs]

14:58.147 --> 15:02.068
And if anyone should object,
now is the time to do that.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.778
[Dulcinea] I object!

15:03.861 --> 15:05.530
[all gasping]

15:09.617 --> 15:12.328
[Malaranea's voice] So, your friends
used a dream spell on you.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.372
Welcome to the nightmare.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.499
Do I have to get married twice?

15:20.294 --> 15:22.338
You want a piece of me?

15:22.505 --> 15:24.715
I sure do, sister.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.595
[both grunting]

15:30.638 --> 15:31.681
Puss, wake up!

15:31.764 --> 15:32.807
[grunts]

15:32.890 --> 15:35.601
What do you mean?
I am as awake as I've ever been.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.687
Am I not, flying unicorn Eames?

15:37.770 --> 15:39.188
You sure are, Puss.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.066
[both grunting]

15:43.192 --> 15:44.610
[groans]

15:45.445 --> 15:50.950
Puss, you're stuck in a dream!
Look around, I'm fighting a magical twin.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.160
[grunts]

15:52.326 --> 15:53.661
[Puss] So?

15:53.744 --> 15:55.455
Eames can fly!

15:55.538 --> 15:57.373
Whee!

15:57.457 --> 15:58.291
Right!

15:58.458 --> 15:59.584
[both grunting]

15:59.667 --> 16:02.336
Toby is ten little tiny Tobies. [grunts]

16:02.462 --> 16:04.714
[Tobies giggling]

16:06.048 --> 16:08.718
[laughs] Tobies.

16:09.218 --> 16:14.765
It's okay, buddy. This is obviously
not a dream. The answer is clear.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.726
Dulcinea's gone cuckoo.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.730
Cuckoo? Cu... ckoo...

16:20.813 --> 16:22.732
[Malaranea laughs]

16:23.399 --> 16:25.067
Just a little longer.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.777
[laughs]

16:28.613 --> 16:29.447
Puss!

16:29.530 --> 16:31.574
[grunts]
[screams]

16:37.705 --> 16:38.748
[growls]

16:39.582 --> 16:40.500
[Dulcinea screams]

16:40.583 --> 16:42.376
[Dulcinea grunting]

16:42.460 --> 16:46.339
San Lorenzans, she is not one of us!

16:46.923 --> 16:48.549
Attack!

16:50.551 --> 16:52.470
Puss! [grunts]

16:55.348 --> 16:56.390
[Dulcinea screams]

16:56.974 --> 16:58.809
What?
[whimpering]

16:58.893 --> 17:00.353
[Puss grunting]

17:05.733 --> 17:06.651
[growls]

17:06.733 --> 17:08.528
[Puss grunting]

17:10.488 --> 17:14.909
Dream or no,
I will not have anyone attack Dulcinea...

17:14.992 --> 17:15.826
[groans]

17:20.748 --> 17:24.001
You are ruining my wedding!

17:24.126 --> 17:25.336
[shrieks]

17:27.922 --> 17:31.259
Puss. Stay with us.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.929
Puss. You're my best friend.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.973
[grunting]

17:37.056 --> 17:40.893
She can't last much longer in there.
We have to get her out!

17:41.561 --> 17:42.728
Hmm.

17:43.354 --> 17:46.232
Wait! [mutters]

17:48.943 --> 17:50.736
I see. Just a little longer!

17:51.904 --> 17:52.863
[gasps]

17:57.743 --> 17:59.370
Do you believe me now?

18:03.541 --> 18:05.001
Mm... Maybe?

18:05.084 --> 18:06.294
[Artephius grunting]

18:13.759 --> 18:14.677
[spits]

18:15.011 --> 18:16.137
Whoo!

18:16.762 --> 18:17.972
[spits]

18:18.055 --> 18:19.223
Whoa!

18:24.228 --> 18:25.896
[grunts]
Oh!

18:25.980 --> 18:27.106
[grunts]

18:27.189 --> 18:29.233
[whimpering]

18:32.695 --> 18:34.739
[both screaming]

18:37.325 --> 18:39.493
Oh! [straining]

18:45.124 --> 18:46.709
Gotcha!

18:48.127 --> 18:50.129
[laughs]

18:51.005 --> 18:52.590
[growls]
[grunts]

18:54.800 --> 18:55.801
[grunts]

18:56.552 --> 18:57.428
Oh.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.101
[rumbling]

19:07.063 --> 19:08.272
[thunderclap]

19:08.856 --> 19:10.316
Oh, Puss!

19:10.399 --> 19:11.275
I am all right.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.236
[screams]

19:23.079 --> 19:24.205
[thunderclap]

19:29.627 --> 19:30.503
[groans]

19:37.426 --> 19:39.428
[Puss groaning]

19:41.764 --> 19:42.723
I am in a dream.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.059
That's what I've been saying, Puss.

19:45.142 --> 19:48.145
She has you in a spell,
so she can drain you of your life force.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.607
So, none of this is real?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.444
And, there is no wedding?

19:56.237 --> 19:57.613
I'm afraid not.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.531
[sighs]

20:00.741 --> 20:02.910
I am most foolish for believing this.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.789
[grunting]

20:10.501 --> 20:14.839
Puss, you're dying.
That's why you're feeling this way.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.049
We don't have much time.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.427
Please wake up.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.681
Wake up!

20:25.391 --> 20:27.268
[grunts]
[gasps]

20:32.189 --> 20:34.859
Puss, I'm scared.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.236
Me too.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.212
[gasps]

20:55.296 --> 20:58.466
Wha-who-Who am I?
I'm alive!

20:58.883 --> 21:01.677
No! How is this possible?

21:04.388 --> 21:05.556
[groans]

21:09.185 --> 21:10.811
[grunts]

21:10.895 --> 21:17.318
We cats do not always land on our feet.
Sometimes we land on your feet.

21:17.401 --> 21:22.072
Ow! Ooh, see if you ever wake up
after you taste my venom.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.158
[spits]

21:25.701 --> 21:27.870
[chokes, gulps]

21:28.704 --> 21:31.749
Gross!

21:36.462 --> 21:37.546
Look!

21:38.255 --> 21:39.298
Ah.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.312
[giggles] So, do you always
dream about marrying me?

21:53.395 --> 21:55.439
Huh? [giggles]

21:55.523 --> 21:59.485
Anyway, now that we have
the second piece of the crown's gem,

21:59.568 --> 22:02.738
we must move on to the next witch.
Come, my friends.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.617
[Malaranea snoring]

22:07.785 --> 22:09.370
[door creaks]

22:12.039 --> 22:12.998
[door closes]

22:13.791 --> 22:15.334
[snoring]

22:19.797 --> 22:21.465
More tea, my dear?

22:22.633 --> 22:24.301
Yes, my sweet.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.136
[slurping]

22:27.137 --> 22:31.976
Oh, isn't this lovely?
It's like a dream come true.

22:32.309 --> 22:36.105
[both laugh]
[Malaranea sighs]

22:36.188 --> 22:38.065
I'm still a unicorn!
