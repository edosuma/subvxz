00:24.477 --> 00:28.789
'Life's all pain.
Pain, rejection and gloom.

00:28.837 --> 00:33.228
'Why do we pretend there's not
a yawning blankness at the heart of...

00:33.277 --> 00:38.226
'Hey, 330/0 extra free.
I am doing excellent shopping.

00:38.277 --> 00:42.509
'My depression means
I'm being even more frugal than normal. '

00:42.557 --> 00:44.673
- Mark!
- Hey, Jeremy.

00:44.717 --> 00:48.392
You realise tinned food
is just for crackheads and wars?

00:48.437 --> 00:50.234
Oh, no, mate,

00:50.277 --> 00:54.668
- this stuff's 78 pence a 100ml.
- Yeah, it's first pressing.

00:54.717 --> 00:58.949
You don't wait until everyone else
has had fun with the olives.

00:58.997 --> 01:02.273
Fourth pressing,
that's a party in your mouth!

01:02.317 --> 01:04.876
Look, we've been through this before,

01:04.917 --> 01:09.945
I do the joint shopping solo because
I don't make impulse purchases and...

01:09.997 --> 01:13.069
Mark! I'm not shopping,
I just came to tell you

01:13.117 --> 01:16.234
that we've been invited
to a very wicked party.

01:16.277 --> 01:20.111
Do I look like a man who goes to
wicked parties? Ask Toni.

01:20.157 --> 01:22.148
I did, actually, but she said no.

01:22.197 --> 01:24.836
But it's better this way - two lads.

01:24.877 --> 01:28.392
We've got to get out there,
grooving, doing it, you know?

01:28.437 --> 01:30.826
It's been a long time for either of us.

01:30.877 --> 01:34.313
I haven't had my oats
in something like... two weeks.

01:34.357 --> 01:36.313
'Nine months and 13 days. '

01:36.357 --> 01:39.952
Look, people will think
we spend the whole time wanking.

01:39.997 --> 01:43.194
Don't be ridiculous,
they're for wiping up mess.

01:43.237 --> 01:46.229
Yeah, man mess.
That's why they're mansize.

01:46.277 --> 01:49.986
They're for men -
men's noses, big manly snot.

01:51.917 --> 01:54.795
Oh, Mark, come on, man, let it go.

01:54.837 --> 01:56.236
What?

01:56.277 --> 02:01.305
Why do you have to have a huge can
of lager that makes you really drunk?

02:01.357 --> 02:05.270
What if you want to get
Sophie home and get her all lathered up?

02:05.317 --> 02:07.308
That's not going to happen.

02:07.357 --> 02:10.269
- Oh, shit, did you...?
- Mm-hm.

02:10.317 --> 02:12.387
And she...?

02:12.437 --> 02:16.635
I mean, it's not a date or anything
because I've got a mega-pass.

02:16.677 --> 02:18.713
How do you feel about row G?

02:18.757 --> 02:21.191
- Tonight?
- Yeah, I thought...

02:21.237 --> 02:25.276
Oh, Mark, listen, I'm sorry,
I'd love to but, er...

02:25.317 --> 02:27.308
I've got this... thing.

02:27.357 --> 02:32.351
Oh, man, I'm... But listen, this is the
perfect time to get back in the game.

02:32.397 --> 02:37.346
You know? Two guys,
together, out, looking for... it.

02:37.397 --> 02:39.308
No, thank you.

02:39.357 --> 02:43.908
How much pain can I experience at home
with spaghetti carbonara and Das Boot?

02:43.957 --> 02:48.428
Look, it's Friday night, most people
don't do their shopping now,

02:48.477 --> 02:51.389
- they're out right now.
- Right. No queues.

02:51.437 --> 02:53.997
So who exactly is winning, eh?

02:58.837 --> 03:03.035
'OK, well, I'm here
so I'll just sit here and drink.

03:03.077 --> 03:05.147
'No one can stop me doing that.

03:05.197 --> 03:07.552
'Just drink myself to death.

03:09.197 --> 03:13.748
'I bet he gets sex tonight
and I have to listen to it through the wall.

03:13.797 --> 03:18.712
'Maybe she might go to the bathroom
and accidentally come into my room.

03:18.757 --> 03:22.875
'And what? She fucks you?
No, she says "whoops" and goes out.

03:22.917 --> 03:24.873
'Stop doing this to yourself. '

03:24.917 --> 03:27.306
So, safe party, yeah?

03:27.357 --> 03:29.587
Super safe!

03:29.637 --> 03:32.026
'OK, playing it cool, huh?

03:32.077 --> 03:36.355
'All right, how about I go
a little Oscar Wilde on your ass? '

03:36.397 --> 03:38.786
I always go for the first pressing.

03:38.837 --> 03:44.116
I mean, why wait until everyone else
has had fun with the olives, right?

03:45.117 --> 03:48.393
'What's her problem?
This is the 21 st century.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.712
'Olive oil is an acceptable topic. '

03:53.037 --> 03:55.267
'Someone here's got psoriasis.

03:55.317 --> 03:59.276
'One of the less common skin ailments.
Yeast infection.

03:59.317 --> 04:03.788
'Thrush if you're thinking glamorous,
athlete's foot if you're not.

04:03.837 --> 04:06.635
'A fellow migraine sufferer.

04:06.677 --> 04:11.546
'Everyone at this party isn't as young,
fit and single as they make out.

04:11.597 --> 04:15.385
'Let's face it,
we're all falling apart piece by piece.

04:15.437 --> 04:18.873
'Doesn't matter if you're single
or in a couple,

04:18.916 --> 04:22.830
'you... are... going... to... die. '

04:25.437 --> 04:28.031
Er... frozen stuff.

04:28.077 --> 04:31.513
I, er, don't want them to, you know, thaw.

04:35.357 --> 04:39.236
Hey! You got Findus Crispy Pancakes -
I love them!

04:39.277 --> 04:43.236
They're just so... disgusting, aren't they?

04:43.277 --> 04:44.915
Er, yeah.

04:44.957 --> 04:49.348
My sister, who's a smackhead,
I ended up there for Christmas dinner

04:49.397 --> 04:55.188
and we had turkey Findus Crispy
Pancakes. I wanted to kill myself.

04:55.237 --> 04:57.990
That would be the natural reaction.

04:59.037 --> 05:03.269
- Can I have a jam doughnut?
- Er, yeah, sure.

05:03.317 --> 05:06.036
So who are you trying to bone tonight?

05:06.077 --> 05:11.674
Oh, I'm not in the game. If I can get
my shopping home intact I'll be happy.

05:11.717 --> 05:13.867
Just like, be honest about it.

05:13.917 --> 05:17.273
I mean, let's line up, two naked rows,

05:17.317 --> 05:20.548
best-looking people
can pick the best-looking,

05:20.597 --> 05:23.873
the dregs get the dregs
and we can get it over with.

05:23.917 --> 05:27.273
That's a very attractive system
you're proposing.

05:27.317 --> 05:32.266
And it saves them having to humiliate
themselves. Check out this guy.

05:32.317 --> 05:34.228
Yeah.

05:38.597 --> 05:42.192
'Knew this would pay off.
Talking's bullshit.

05:42.237 --> 05:44.990
"'Yeah, I did this. I go there. "

05:45.997 --> 05:49.956
'OK, there's a new guy in town.
Probably just a friend.

05:49.997 --> 05:53.785
'Yeah. Me, her and her friend.
Kind of nice really.

05:54.877 --> 05:57.835
'H-Hey! That's a foul! Fuck!

05:57.877 --> 06:00.994
'God, she must be loving this.
I feel so cheap.

06:01.037 --> 06:03.505
'I really thought we had something. '

06:03.557 --> 06:11.555
So you work in an office and you've got,
like, your computer and your desk...

06:11.597 --> 06:13.588
God, that is so fucking weird!

06:13.637 --> 06:16.834
Yeah, well, you know,
everything's decaying,

06:16.877 --> 06:20.267
so the way I see it
has there ever been a better time

06:20.317 --> 06:22.877
to save up for a very comfortable sofa?

06:22.917 --> 06:27.149
'She's a teenager, Mark.
You'll get castrated by the menfolk.

06:27.197 --> 06:29.233
'Maybe she's a...

06:29.277 --> 06:32.428
- 'Oh, God. '
- Hey! Love the suit!

06:32.477 --> 06:35.116
Are you selling insurance?

06:35.157 --> 06:39.116
No need to look like you're sittin'
on a brush, man, we're only razzin' ya.

06:39.157 --> 06:41.148
? We are the mods
? We are the mods

06:41.197 --> 06:43.552
? We are, we are, we are the mods?

06:45.197 --> 06:48.906
My brother is such a dickhead.
I wish he was dead.

06:48.957 --> 06:53.667
That's a bit much. Just pretend
you need his bone marrow. That's agony.

06:55.997 --> 07:01.117
'She's snogging him already.
The dream is over, I am detritus. '

07:01.157 --> 07:05.036
Hey, Jez! I just wanted to tell you,
we're going.

07:05.077 --> 07:07.545
- To the Lazer Bowl.
- The Lazer Bowl?

07:07.597 --> 07:11.112
Yeah, me and Valerie.
We were gonna kill her brother

07:11.157 --> 07:14.229
but we thought the Lazer Bowl
would be more fun.

07:14.277 --> 07:17.349
Me, you and Valerie
are going to the Lazer Bowl?

07:17.397 --> 07:21.026
I hadn't thought you would be.
See you later at home?

07:21.077 --> 07:24.387
Do you think...
Would you mind taking the shopping?

07:24.437 --> 07:27.668
I've left some stuff
in the freezer compartment.

07:27.717 --> 07:30.595
Hey, maybe I could
bring someone along?

07:30.637 --> 07:32.593
Er... I mean...

07:33.797 --> 07:35.992
- I guess.
- I'll call Toni.

07:36.037 --> 07:38.949
Yeah, no, this is perfect, cos I'll just say,

07:38.997 --> 07:43.707
"Hey, me, Mark and Valerie are off down
the Lazer Bowl, do you wanna come?"

07:43.757 --> 07:47.147
- And she'll be, like, "Hell, yeah!"
- You think so?

07:51.477 --> 07:54.833
So he was all,
you want a piece of the action?

07:54.877 --> 08:00.827
And I was all, hell, yeah! I mean,
this is definitely not the rehearsal.

08:00.877 --> 08:04.756
Why not go to the Lazer Bowl
with the kid next door?

08:04.797 --> 08:08.187
'I've got to take
Jeremy's advice more often.

08:08.237 --> 08:13.436
'I'm on a date with a teenage goth,
smoking pot in the Lazer Bowl toilets.

08:13.477 --> 08:16.196
'This is it. This is literally it.

08:16.237 --> 08:19.991
'This is what people do
when they're having a good time. '

08:21.037 --> 08:23.392
Um... er... I don't know.

08:23.437 --> 08:25.473
It's good stuff, Mark.

08:25.517 --> 08:28.793
I strongly advise you to toke it.

08:33.517 --> 08:36.395
Erm, do you want me
to give you blowback?

08:36.437 --> 08:38.029
What, here?

08:38.077 --> 08:40.716
'Oh, my God, it's the last days of Rome! '

08:40.756 --> 08:44.875
Sure, open your mouth and breathe in
when I click my fingers.

08:49.397 --> 08:51.149
Wow!

08:51.197 --> 08:55.349
'I've been initiated. I am a drug user.
Fuck the police! '

08:55.397 --> 08:58.116
This is it, mate. We're having it.

08:58.157 --> 09:00.990
Jez, the faces, the faces.

09:01.037 --> 09:03.346
I feel... strange.

09:03.397 --> 09:05.957
Do you? Follow the fingers...

09:05.997 --> 09:08.113
Don't poke my eyes! Don't poke my eyes!

09:08.157 --> 09:11.194
- Are you getting visuals?
- What if I lose it?

09:11.237 --> 09:13.432
I'm not gonna do a poo, am I, Jez?

09:13.477 --> 09:17.231
Of course not.
Look, everything's going brilliantly.

09:17.277 --> 09:19.666
We've got to work together as a team.

09:19.717 --> 09:23.596
Work things up into a bit of a lather,
yeah? Follow my lead.

09:23.637 --> 09:27.710
'Jez is so great. He's like an idiot savant
but not so stupid.

09:27.757 --> 09:31.989
'I bet he's totally sorting
this whole night for us right now. '

09:32.037 --> 09:36.030
'I could say we've got huge cocks -
might be the clincher. '

09:36.077 --> 09:38.147
This is great, isn't it?

09:38.197 --> 09:40.757
This is so... it.

09:40.797 --> 09:44.187
I am having a just great time.

09:44.237 --> 09:45.795
Great!

09:47.117 --> 09:51.508
So, girls, what's the weirdest place
you've ever...

09:51.557 --> 09:53.787
done it.

09:53.837 --> 09:58.069
I had a steward eat me at Dubai airport.
God, that was depressing.

09:58.117 --> 10:00.233
Yeah, right.

10:00.277 --> 10:02.233
Valerie, how about you?

10:02.277 --> 10:04.552
I believe true love waits.

10:04.597 --> 10:07.509
Uh-huh, yeah. Me too.

10:07.557 --> 10:10.435
Er, Jesus, I'm kidding.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.468
Yeah, right, obviously, no.

10:13.557 --> 10:16.025
Me too.

10:16.077 --> 10:19.308
OK, so, what's everyone's
favourite record?

10:20.357 --> 10:22.951
Jesus, what was all that about?

10:22.997 --> 10:25.909
I guess she just
really likes Sledgehammer.

10:25.957 --> 10:28.391
I mean, that's a shit song, right?

10:28.437 --> 10:29.836
Yeah.

10:29.877 --> 10:31.868
'Forgive me, Peter. '

10:31.917 --> 10:34.511
- I mean, it's so outdated.
- Exactly!

10:34.557 --> 10:38.027
And suddenly I'm up in front
of the middle-aged court

10:38.077 --> 10:40.716
for crimes against being an old fucker.

10:40.757 --> 10:44.591
What's her problem?
I've never heard of Level 42 either.

10:44.637 --> 10:46.867
'Guys, I'm so sorry. '

10:49.997 --> 10:53.467
Hey, gutter boy,
you are allowed to hit the pins!

10:53.517 --> 10:57.032
- You are?
- In some bowling alleys it's encouraged.

10:57.077 --> 10:59.033
I didn't want to disturb them.

10:59.077 --> 11:01.875
That's kind of you, quite the gentleman.

11:01.917 --> 11:04.192
Hey, spread 'em!

11:08.837 --> 11:10.236
Wah-hoo!

11:10.277 --> 11:12.711
'Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. '

11:12.757 --> 11:16.386
- Hi, Mark
- Hi, Sophie, er...

11:16.437 --> 11:19.395
- This is Valerie.
- Hi.

11:20.477 --> 11:23.549
- How's it going?
- Good, thanks, and you two?

11:23.597 --> 11:25.872
Oh, yeah, yeah, fine. Er...

11:25.917 --> 11:28.385
I... Valerie and I, er...

11:28.437 --> 11:31.349
I mean, we just met at a party

11:31.397 --> 11:35.709
and we thought, you know,
we'd come here for a few... bowls.

11:35.757 --> 11:37.748
And I'm high, obviously.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.753
How about you?

11:39.797 --> 11:41.867
- I've been with Jeff.
- Jeff?!

11:41.917 --> 11:43.987
All right, Mark.

11:45.717 --> 11:49.915
'This should be in the bag.
Why isn't this in the bag?

11:49.957 --> 11:51.948
'She looks like she hates me. '

11:51.997 --> 11:55.034
What? It's "eat as much
as you can," you know.

11:55.077 --> 11:57.989
No, it's "eat as much as you like".

11:58.037 --> 12:00.426
There's no competitive element implied.

12:00.477 --> 12:02.911
At 3.99 I think I know who's winning.

12:02.957 --> 12:05.551
How dare she criticise Peter Gabriel.

12:05.597 --> 12:09.829
With her little "screw me" haircut,
and all so nee-nee-nee-ee.

12:09.877 --> 12:12.186
He single-handedly created WOMAD.

12:12.237 --> 12:16.469
'Oh, God, please stop talking
about Peter Gabriel. '

12:16.517 --> 12:17.950
Uh-huh.

12:17.997 --> 12:22.707
I can't believe it, I'm on a double-date
with guys from the office.

12:22.757 --> 12:24.748
It's like being on Friends.

12:24.797 --> 12:26.913
Yeah, this is great.

12:26.957 --> 12:30.996
So do you guys
get pissed at the Christmas party

12:31.037 --> 12:33.028
and photocopy your arses?

12:33.077 --> 12:35.545
Yeah, Jeff did do that actually.

12:35.597 --> 12:40.591
- That was before everyone else did.
- You were something of a trendsetter.

12:41.597 --> 12:44.669
So, Valerie, you still at school or what?

12:44.717 --> 12:46.628
She's at college actually.

12:46.677 --> 12:49.714
- Sixth-form college.
- That's the old college.

12:49.757 --> 12:52.590
Right. So what's your favourite subject?

12:52.637 --> 12:56.312
I'm sure Valerie doesn't want
to talk about subjects.

12:56.357 --> 12:58.746
Yeah, sure. So who's best in S-Club?

12:58.797 --> 13:02.915
Oh, erm... I'm not really into them

13:02.957 --> 13:05.676
but I hear they have a big gay following.

13:09.477 --> 13:14.915
'For the worst thing that could possibly
happen this is going extremely well. '

13:19.477 --> 13:24.312
'Maybe I can just really get into Peter
Gabriel and go mental and marry her

13:24.357 --> 13:28.270
'and have lots of sex
and agree with her about everything? '

13:29.397 --> 13:34.107
'I'm bursting! This is why
you should stick to the little cans.

13:34.157 --> 13:36.955
'Ah, the simple pleasures. Oh. '

13:36.997 --> 13:40.307
- You havin' a good night?
- Er, yeah, yeah.

13:40.357 --> 13:42.313
Nice bowling.

13:42.357 --> 13:45.827
You've narrowed it down
to one lane anyway.

13:45.877 --> 13:48.345
Well, you know, it's just a bit of fun.

13:48.397 --> 13:51.787
'Oh, God, I'm never
gonna be able to go now.

13:51.837 --> 13:53.793
'Why can't I go? '

13:53.837 --> 13:55.828
Yeah, just a bit of fun.

13:55.877 --> 13:59.347
After a nice Italian
and a couple of bottles of wine.

13:59.397 --> 14:02.867
- 'Fuck. Italian, wine. '
- Sophie liked it, anyway.

14:02.917 --> 14:05.989
- 'Why didn't I ask her? '
- Loved it, actually.

14:06.037 --> 14:07.993
'Oh... Shit.

14:08.037 --> 14:10.426
'Waterfalls... nothing.

14:10.477 --> 14:12.468
'Pretend you've finished. '

14:12.517 --> 14:14.314
Ahh.

14:17.157 --> 14:21.469
- Any change for the johnny machine?
- What? You...

14:21.517 --> 14:23.587
Actually, I think I'm all right.

14:24.997 --> 14:27.716
I'm thinking a couple of packs of normal.

14:27.757 --> 14:29.987
Knobblies are a bit of a con.

14:30.037 --> 14:33.473
Maybe a couple of fruities for a laugh.

14:33.517 --> 14:37.476
'She hates fruit. Except pears.
If there's pear flavour I'm fucked. '

14:37.517 --> 14:41.749
I can't stop hanging on for you
because I never started.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.186
Well, here's the headlines, buddy!

14:44.237 --> 14:48.833
I can do who I want, when I want,
where I want and I will, OK?!

14:51.437 --> 14:53.712
This is not the rehearsal.

14:53.757 --> 14:57.511
'Come on, clock's ticking,
got to raise my game.

14:57.557 --> 14:59.912
'Think witty. Charming and witty.

14:59.957 --> 15:01.913
'And sexy. '

15:01.957 --> 15:06.747
- Sorry about that. Listen...
- So, fourth pressing, fifth pressing...

15:06.797 --> 15:10.790
What's that all about? Why wait until
everyone else has had their fun...

15:10.837 --> 15:13.305
That is so true.

15:20.517 --> 15:21.916
Mm.

15:21.957 --> 15:25.427
Listen, let's talk more
back at my place, yeah?

15:25.477 --> 15:29.106
'Oh, my God, I knew it.
Olive oil talk. Wicked! '

15:29.157 --> 15:33.196
So, this is nice. Kind of weird but...

15:33.237 --> 15:35.034
Nice, yeah.

15:35.077 --> 15:40.868
Great. So I was just wondering how
you ended up coming out with... Jeff?

15:41.637 --> 15:46.188
Oh, right. Erm, well,
I suppose, well, he asked me.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.228
He asked you. Of course.

15:48.277 --> 15:51.235
- Is that all it takes?
- It certainly helps.

15:51.277 --> 15:54.235
I mean, I did actually ask you myself.

15:54.917 --> 15:59.308
Yes, well, I was already...
and I didn't say anything because...

15:59.357 --> 16:03.145
Well, you know.
So, er, Valerie seems nice.

16:03.197 --> 16:05.188
- She's nothing.
- Oh, right.

16:05.237 --> 16:06.989
'That didn't sound good. '

16:07.037 --> 16:11.508
I mean, it's just a little night out.
I'm a friend of her brother's.

16:11.557 --> 16:13.991
He's a total wanker, actually.

16:14.037 --> 16:17.916
So, have you had a good time
on your... date?

16:17.957 --> 16:20.630
Yeah, you know what you're getting
with Pizza Hut.

16:20.677 --> 16:22.872
'Ha! I win! '

16:22.917 --> 16:24.748
Cool.

16:24.797 --> 16:29.666
So, old seat-sniffer didn't sniff
any of the seats or anything, did he?

16:29.717 --> 16:33.312
That's a rumour that isn't
appropriate for you to...

16:33.357 --> 16:35.996
- Jeff's a nice guy.
- Who should've...

16:36.037 --> 16:38.790
Look, I'm having a nice time.
Leave it, OK?

16:38.837 --> 16:41.192
- You're having a good time.
- Yeah.

16:41.237 --> 16:44.627
Good, because
I'm having a great time too.

16:44.677 --> 16:47.350
That makes two of us
having a great time.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.991
'She's not gonna do it. They won't do it. '

16:52.557 --> 16:57.267
'Wow. Fuck you, lord of death,
I'm still full of piss and vinegar.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.751
'Mm, doing it with a sexy neighbour.

16:59.797 --> 17:04.233
'Ow! That... Why is she sucking it?
Maybe she's practising for my...

17:04.277 --> 17:06.790
'Are you allowed to say when it hurts? '

17:06.837 --> 17:08.906
Whoa, shit!

17:08.957 --> 17:13.872
I divided them into three piles -
yours, mine and don't knows.

17:13.916 --> 17:15.794
Yeah, whatever.

17:15.837 --> 17:17.873
'Maybe this is good?

17:17.916 --> 17:20.795
'Maybe this kind of... turns me on? '

17:20.837 --> 17:25.115
- Then I'll have the Bhundu Boys album.
- Bollocks you are!

17:25.156 --> 17:28.706
- You'd never even heard of them.
- That is such shit.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.715
- Maybe I'II...
- You're not going anywhere.

17:33.077 --> 17:34.988
Boom!

17:40.677 --> 17:44.511
You'll have to do something special
to catch me up, mate.

17:44.557 --> 17:49.187
'Don't let him know he's got to you.
Play it cool. Play it suave. '

17:49.237 --> 17:51.228
Oh, I think I can manage that.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.586
Watch me bowl, Jeff.

18:02.597 --> 18:05.748
I'm bowling, all right?! I'm bowling fruit!

18:10.637 --> 18:13.549
I'm on another level! I've gone beyond!

18:22.757 --> 18:24.713
Fancy a refill?

18:24.757 --> 18:26.748
Er...

18:28.837 --> 18:30.236
OK.

18:30.277 --> 18:33.633
'This is some sort of test.
Like The Great Escape.

18:33.677 --> 18:36.908
'Don't answer in English,
just brave it out. '

18:36.957 --> 18:38.948
Jeremy's a musician.

18:39.917 --> 18:41.475
Uh-huh.

18:41.517 --> 18:43.712
Yeah, I, er, play the keyboard.

18:43.757 --> 18:48.512
You always fancied one of those
keyboards you hold like a guitar.

18:49.597 --> 18:51.588
Used to like a lot of things.

18:51.637 --> 18:55.710
'They're gonna use me for a sex game
and then burn me in the bath. '

18:55.757 --> 19:00.831
Isn't this great, that we can sit
and have a drink together like adults?

19:00.877 --> 19:02.993
Yeah, we're great, aren't we?

19:03.037 --> 19:05.028
Why don't we have a toast?

19:06.357 --> 19:08.313
To us.

19:09.557 --> 19:12.754
- To us.
- To us.

19:12.797 --> 19:17.666
'Oh, come on, someone get the
carving knife and let's get it over with. '

19:17.717 --> 19:22.666
Do you think I like this job?
Do you think I like spending all night

19:22.717 --> 19:27.074
trying to prise shopping
out of our frankly antiquated system?

19:27.117 --> 19:32.066
I'm... sorry. I'm really sorry.
I thought they would just...

19:32.117 --> 19:35.712
I've got your number, mate.
I've got you by the shoes.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.430
He doesn't care about the shoes!

19:39.437 --> 19:42.952
- Fuck your shoes.
- Come on, he's said he's sorry.

19:42.997 --> 19:45.352
What do you know about my shoes?

19:45.397 --> 19:50.346
We're gonna head off, but... I can vouch
for him so could you put it on my card?

19:50.397 --> 19:55.073
Look... Don't go!
Soph, you should stay and bowl.

19:55.117 --> 19:57.108
Bowl the night away, with us.

19:57.157 --> 19:59.148
Er, I don't know...

19:59.197 --> 20:02.712
Once they get the stuff out
we can have a tournament.

20:02.757 --> 20:06.272
I don't think the plastic
can take the strain.

20:06.317 --> 20:10.276
Mark, they're going home to bone, yeah?

20:10.317 --> 20:12.228
Don't screw things up.

20:12.277 --> 20:15.349
- But...
- You have a good night now.

20:15.397 --> 20:16.796
Bye.

20:16.837 --> 20:20.113
'Don't think about it. If you don't
think about it, it won't happen.

20:22.677 --> 20:25.555
'Straight to Frenching. This is so easy.

20:25.597 --> 20:29.112
'I bet Sophie and Jeff
are doing a lot of talking now.

20:29.157 --> 20:33.912
'She can really talk, probably boring him
about the Celestine Prophecy.

20:33.957 --> 20:38.826
'Maybe Jeff's bought loads of booze
so Sophie's too pissed to mind.

20:38.877 --> 20:40.913
'Ow! She's squeezing my...

20:40.957 --> 20:42.834
'Don't complain! '

20:42.877 --> 20:47.587
'Is she going for...? I'm not ready,
there's no action down there. '

20:47.637 --> 20:50.435
Jeremy, are you not...?

20:50.477 --> 20:54.868
Look, are you sure this is OK?
You know, isn't Tony gonna mind?

20:54.917 --> 21:00.469
Tony lost his licence to mind when he
went off with a scrubber called Lindsay!

21:02.797 --> 21:05.516
'She hasn't said anything about my nuts.

21:05.557 --> 21:08.754
'She's too young
to know how weird they are.

21:08.797 --> 21:11.186
'I'm having sex with a teenage girl!

21:11.237 --> 21:14.786
'Sophie wouldn't,
not with the seat-sniffer.

21:14.837 --> 21:18.591
'I mean, we've got a connection.
This is not wrong.

21:18.637 --> 21:21.549
'Just try and memorise it for later.

21:21.597 --> 21:25.829
'Mm, this could be nice,
a nice, lovely neck rub.

21:25.877 --> 21:29.153
'She's strangling me!
She's trying to kill me! '

21:29.197 --> 21:31.427
I... I can't...

21:31.477 --> 21:33.354
I can't...

21:36.037 --> 21:38.631
Jesus, Valerie, w-what?!

21:38.677 --> 21:40.907
Just say if you didn't like it!

21:40.957 --> 21:43.517
- My ex used to love that.
- Well, yeah.

21:43.557 --> 21:46.117
Thanks. Thank you.

21:46.157 --> 21:49.866
It was just the... not breathing. You know.

21:51.317 --> 21:54.036
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God.

21:54.077 --> 21:57.786
You can be as loud as you like!

21:57.837 --> 21:59.429
Oh, God.

21:59.477 --> 22:02.628
Oh, God, this is great!

22:02.677 --> 22:05.953
I'm having great sex!

22:05.997 --> 22:08.511
- Oh! Oh!
- Yeah, yeah.

22:08.557 --> 22:11.435
Couldn't we... close... the door?

22:11.477 --> 22:14.514
The idea of getting caught turns me on!

22:14.557 --> 22:17.230
But we've already been caught.

22:17.277 --> 22:20.667
- The cappuccino machine?
- You're never!

22:20.717 --> 22:23.629
Taking! The Gaggia!

22:23.677 --> 22:27.670
Thanks for letting me stay.
My sister's in my room and...

22:27.717 --> 22:30.470
No problem, I'll be fine on the sofa.

22:30.517 --> 22:35.147
Have you got everything you need?
Do you want the hall light left on?

22:35.197 --> 22:39.315
- Mark...
- No, right, sure. Of course.

22:39.357 --> 22:42.269
'She does look kind of great
in my pyjamas.

22:42.317 --> 22:44.467
'That's sick. Why is that sick? '

22:44.517 --> 22:46.712
Valerie, I-I was thinking...

22:46.757 --> 22:50.466
Oh, God, Jeremy, this is the best!

22:50.517 --> 22:52.985
Best ever!

22:54.197 --> 22:57.234
Yeah, so I was... The sofa, it's a bit...

22:57.277 --> 22:59.268
You are the daddy!
