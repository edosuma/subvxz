00:35.827 --> 00:42.167


01:11.654 --> 01:14.574
Nothing can separate us
from the love of Christ.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.703
-Neither life nor death--
-Kyle.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.414
All right. Don't you lose hope, Maddie.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.125
I know who you are, and I know
you know I can't let you back there.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.669
-If I could just talk to Howie--
-Dr. Townsend, please.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.672
I understand. If I had any news
I could share with you, I would,

01:29.756 --> 01:30.673
but I don't.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.053
Hey, no news on Kyle yet?

01:35.678 --> 01:36.805
What did you find out?

01:37.388 --> 01:39.099
Well, Howie's back there,

01:39.182 --> 01:42.268
and there's no better doctor
in the county, including me, so…

01:42.352 --> 01:43.728
Oh God.

01:43.812 --> 01:47.398
Annie, call me, please. Please!

01:47.482 --> 01:48.775
-Mom?
-Annie.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.361
-Annie!
-Tyler!

01:51.444 --> 01:54.572
I'm so sorry! I'm so, so sorry.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.116
I'm just so glad you're okay.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.451
We tried to find him,
and then we saw the car.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.869
Is… is Kyle all right?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.412
We're waiting to hear.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.415
-I'm okay. I'm really okay!
-Oh my God!

02:04.499 --> 02:06.084
We've been calling and calling!

02:06.167 --> 02:08.795
-I left my phone at Jackson's.
-Why?

02:11.422 --> 02:14.300
We're waiting to hear word on Kyle
and your sister.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.681
-I better call my parents.
-They've been called.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.307
Do you, um…

02:22.267 --> 02:23.935
do you know where CeCe is?

02:24.686 --> 02:26.563
I'm pretty sure Simon took her home.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.983
-We wanted to find Kyle and Nellie--
-What happened, Jackson?

02:30.859 --> 02:33.069
Tyler, what happened?

02:33.153 --> 02:37.365
How in all that is holy did your brother
and Nellie wind up in your car?

02:38.992 --> 02:41.077
I'm not sure how to explain that.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.788
Crazy. Things just got crazy.

02:45.456 --> 02:48.042
-Helen. You okay?

02:48.710 --> 02:52.297
I don't even know what's going on.
We're waiting to hear from the doctors.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.008
-Hey, uh, you good?
-As good as I can be.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.554
You?

03:00.763 --> 03:03.391
-The hell's wrong with your boy?
-Bite your tongue, Lewis.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.018
-You don't--
-Bill, please.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.437
I talked to Chief Bolden.
My next call is to my lawyer.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.105
Before you know the truth?

03:09.189 --> 03:13.985
Okay, Bill, Trent, pretty sure
this isn't the time or the place.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.862
Ronnie, what in the hell
are you doing here?

03:16.821 --> 03:18.323
Looking after my family.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.742
Same as we all are.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.871
-Mom.
-What did you do to your sister?

03:24.954 --> 03:28.208
Hey, he really tried to stop Nellie.
That part is not his fault.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.127
Did I invite you into this conversation,
young lady?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.546
-Hey!
-Mama, don't talk to her like that.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.715
Spit it out.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.092
What did you do?

03:38.176 --> 03:40.094
Ms. Lewis, you should let
the admitting nurse know

03:40.178 --> 03:41.596
that you and Trent are here.

03:42.138 --> 03:45.266
Y'all want me to wait for the facts?
Somebody better start coughing 'em up!

03:45.350 --> 03:47.936
The doctors are back
with Nellie and Kyle right now.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.146
They'll come out
when they have something to tell.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.482
And what do you wanna tell me?

03:52.565 --> 03:54.859
You said I could have
people over after prom.

03:54.943 --> 03:55.777
That's an answer?

03:55.860 --> 03:58.571
There was an argument at the party,
and some people wanted to leave.

03:58.655 --> 03:59.572
An argument about what?

03:59.656 --> 04:00.823
-Lots of things.
-Nothing.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.367
Okay, where is everyone else?

04:02.450 --> 04:04.786
Home safe. Kyle and Nellie
were the only ones who took off.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.120
How did Kyle get your car?

04:06.204 --> 04:08.581
Parking was tight,
so I just left my keys in the visor.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.083
Nellie jumped in with him, Dad.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.585
Why in the devil would Kyle do that?
Was he drinking?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.796
-No, of course--
-No, Jackson was the only one drinking.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.008
-Wanna tell that to Chief Bolden, Trent?
-Son?

04:20.218 --> 04:23.179
-I'm sorry, Jackson.
-Don't apologize to him. He started it.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.389
-Drinking?
-Fighting.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.225
No, sir. You and your dweeb brother
got into it all on your own.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.559
-Hey.
-What?

04:28.643 --> 04:29.477
Howie?

04:31.813 --> 04:34.023
-Howie, how's my baby?
-Nellie's gonna be fine.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.402
She has some abrasions and lacerations
and a deep bruise from the seat belt.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.237
-Glad she was wearing it.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.238
And Kyle?

04:40.822 --> 04:44.826
Kyle's injuries are more extensive
but not life-threatening.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.286
Thank God.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.496
-He's with the orthopedist now.
-Orthopedist?

04:48.579 --> 04:52.375
Manal Ahmed. She'll be out soon
to talk with you. They were very lucky.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.378
-Howie, when can we see Nellie?
-They're dressing her lacerations.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.798
Claudia, could you take Mayor
and Mrs. Lewis to see their daughter?

04:58.881 --> 04:59.716
You can follow me.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.092
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.763
You'll have to wait here for Dr. Ahmed.
I know it's hard,

05:05.847 --> 05:07.432
but you have to be patient a bit longer.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.268
Manal is exceptional,
and Kyle couldn't be in better hands.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.187
She'll be out in a moment
to walk you through the entire situation.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.064
-Situation.
-Bill, please.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.651
This is all on you,
you worthless piece of--

05:18.735 --> 05:20.653
You're gonna blame me for <i>your</i> girlfriend?

05:20.737 --> 05:22.530
Some things are actually your fault.

05:22.613 --> 05:25.366
-Your innocent act sucks.
-Maybe CeCe can kick your ass again!

05:25.867 --> 05:27.035
-Enough!

05:27.118 --> 05:27.952
No!

05:28.036 --> 05:29.162
-Tyler.
-Ty!

05:29.245 --> 05:30.079
Howie?

05:30.621 --> 05:31.664
Take it easy.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.207
Get up! Ty, get up. He's fine.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.626
-Back off, Jackson!
-I didn't mean to do that.

05:35.710 --> 05:36.919
Bill, just get away!

05:38.087 --> 05:41.174
Haven't you done enough?
And the car on top of everything else?

05:41.257 --> 05:43.176
Just get away!

05:43.259 --> 05:45.887
-I'll call for a wheelchair.
-No need. On three.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.889
Three, two, one.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.810
I got ya. I got ya. Come on.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.022
Kyle--

05:56.105 --> 05:58.816
I'll wait for word
and then find you and Tyler.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.322
I need to talk to you, soon.

06:06.407 --> 06:10.328
Well, now you seem to be the root of all
that's going wrong tonight, young man.

06:10.411 --> 06:13.164
Bill! Come on. Let's all just simmer down.

06:13.247 --> 06:16.167
No, Ronnie, you're a footnote
on the list of people I wanna talk to--

06:16.250 --> 06:19.379
He is trying to save you
from adding fuel to the fire, Bill!

06:19.462 --> 06:22.173
Can we all slow this down?
Regain our bearings.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.093
Dr. Townsend?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.053
Dr. Ahmed.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.181
How's Kyle?

06:30.264 --> 06:31.766
Asking for his mom?

06:31.849 --> 06:33.476
Yeah, she's with, um…

06:33.976 --> 06:37.105
She'll be along shortly.
What can you tell me in the meantime?

06:37.188 --> 06:41.317
Kyle's main injury is
a full dislocation of the right patella.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.778
There is looseness in the ACL,
indicating a tear,

06:43.861 --> 06:45.196
but it's not torn completely.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.364
That's good news.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.699
-I'd like to do an MRI.
-You're concerned?

06:48.783 --> 06:50.034
Thoroughness.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.870
There's no indication of paralysis
or trauma-induced weakness,

06:52.954 --> 06:56.082
but there is extreme tenderness
in the lumbar region.

06:56.165 --> 06:59.877
And I would like to keep him overnight
because he does present with a concussion.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.004
Sure, yeah.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.089
Um…

07:04.048 --> 07:06.676
-Can I see him before he goes up?
-Of course. I'll take you back.

07:06.759 --> 07:07.718
Okay.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.639
Oh, I suddenly wanna throw up.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.015
Well, it's nerves.

07:14.142 --> 07:17.520
Well, I'll, uh, hold your hair back
like the old days.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.522
This is no time to joke.

07:19.605 --> 07:24.444
Well, look, we gotta laugh, scream, cry,
or we'll all explode, you know?

07:27.280 --> 07:28.781
Annie, come here, baby.

07:29.907 --> 07:30.825
Come here.

07:32.034 --> 07:36.205
Okay, obviously
we need to talk about a lot,

07:36.289 --> 07:37.748
but I want you to know

07:39.167 --> 07:40.334
that I love you.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.463
I'm so grateful that you're okay.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.924
-I tried, Mom.
-What?

07:47.633 --> 07:51.095
To do the right thing,
say the right thing.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.640
Everything just went wrong anyway.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.684
Yeah.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.603
Life gets like that, baby girl.

07:59.687 --> 08:00.521
Hmm?

08:01.647 --> 08:05.485
Hey, I'm really proud of you.
You did the best you could, okay?

08:08.571 --> 08:10.281
It's a "good" fracture,

08:10.364 --> 08:12.909
in that it's clean
and should heal in four to six weeks.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.076
What?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.746
What? What?

08:16.829 --> 08:18.539
Yeah, I understand your distress,

08:18.623 --> 08:21.876
but you have to give it the time it needs
so it heals properly.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.421
Coach, what… what are we gonna do?

08:26.088 --> 08:27.632
We're gonna listen to the doctor.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.344
No, I don't wanna listen to her!

08:31.427 --> 08:33.721
No, I don't wanna listen to any of you!
Just get out!

08:33.804 --> 08:35.014
-Tyler.
-Everyone, get out!

08:35.097 --> 08:38.059
Perhaps y'all could give me
just a moment with Ty?

08:38.142 --> 08:39.560
-Come on.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.271
There we go. Thank you.

08:52.114 --> 08:55.785
Maddie, you let me know
if I can do anything for any of you.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.662
Much appreciated, Erik.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.917
I'm gonna get out of your hair.
My prayers stay with you.

09:03.000 --> 09:03.834
Thank you.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.674
Thanks for all of the updates.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.637
You didn't have to come back.
I told you I could close up.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.848
This doesn't look like closing up. Uh…

09:58.931 --> 10:03.394
No, this is waiting
for the pecan tarts to be done.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.440
You're baking at this hour?

10:07.523 --> 10:10.318
You said it was the thing to do
when nothing made sense.

10:10.401 --> 10:14.280
-Hey, the kids are gonna be okay.
-I know. It's, um… it's not that.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.284
Dana Sue isn't my mother.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.285
Wait.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.370
You asked her?

10:21.454 --> 10:24.081
Yeah. This old boyfriend of hers came by,

10:24.915 --> 10:27.376
and I got all excited
and figured that this is the answer

10:27.460 --> 10:31.631
because she's been so amazing,
and I really wanted her to be my mom.

10:31.714 --> 10:32.757
I get it.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.217
She's a special lady.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.763
I love it here. And if I've made
things weird, and I have to leave--

10:38.846 --> 10:39.847
Pecan tarts?

10:40.348 --> 10:42.933
Yeah, my grandmama's favorite.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.270
What did Dana Sue say when you asked her?

10:46.354 --> 10:47.563
She was flattered

10:48.648 --> 10:52.860
and that she and her friends
would help me find my birth mother.

10:54.153 --> 10:57.531
You see, now?
It's all good, nothing weird.

10:58.407 --> 11:01.994
Love and grace,
that's what you get from those three.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.955
I bet they're quite skilled
at digging up some secrets

11:05.039 --> 11:06.666
when they set their minds to it.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.584
Well, they are special ladies.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.252
Yes, they are.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.882
Yeah, that batch smells done.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.676
Sure.

11:30.106 --> 11:30.940
Mom.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.234
Hey, sweet boy.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.406
-Mm, I messed up.
-We can talk about that later.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.993
Sorry about your car.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.204
Don't even think about it.
Glad you're in one piece.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.666
I ruined it. I ruined everything.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.170
He's medicated, Ty.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.965
Kyle, honey, this can wait.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.633
Ty, talk to me.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.970
Man, your arm. Did I do that?
I didn't mean to hurt you.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.680
You'll do better if you lie still.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.974
You didn't do this,
so chill on that count.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.643
Wow. Can't go to State with a broken arm.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.730
Sucks, dude.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.112
Why don't you take Tyler home, Maddie?

12:18.195 --> 12:20.698
What? No. No, I'm staying here with Kyle.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.324
Maybe you could…

12:24.326 --> 12:27.580
No, Kyle should sleep through the night.
It's what his body needs.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.792
Take Tyler, okay?
Check in on Katie and your mom. I'll stay.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.545
It's the least I can do for all of you.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.301
Call me, either of you,
if anything changes,

12:40.384 --> 12:42.470
and I will be back
first thing in the morning.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.141
I hope you can get
some sleep tonight, okay, son?

13:12.249 --> 13:14.919
-Hot chocolate?
-Oh yeah! Ah!

13:15.002 --> 13:18.172
Even, uh, snuck in
a little peppermint too.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.632
Hope you still like that.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.115
Thanks, Dad.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.245
For this, for bringing me home,

13:49.328 --> 13:50.579
for not yelling at me.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.456
Mm.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.583
I don't see how
you did anything wrong here, kiddo.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.003
I just keep feeling, I don't know,
like I should have stopped them.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.842
Or gotten through to them
or done something different at some point.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.052
I don't know.

14:07.304 --> 14:11.350
Hey, we never wanna see the people
we care about in pain, all right?

14:11.433 --> 14:14.937
And we could try our darndest
to keep them from getting hurt.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.649
Just because you don't want it to happen,

14:19.441 --> 14:21.151
it doesn't make it your fault it did.

14:22.903 --> 14:23.737
All right?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.073
Love you.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.951
Hit the hay.
I'll, uh, stay up till your mom gets here.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.787
-No way I'm sleeping. I'm too wired.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.706
-Okay, then.
-What?

14:33.789 --> 14:37.293
You know, I'm just thinking about
this little girl who would always say,

14:37.376 --> 14:39.253
"Daddy, I'm never going to sleep."

14:40.254 --> 14:44.258
But I'd get out a book,
and I'd start to read and,

14:44.341 --> 14:45.759
bam, out like a light.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.971
Yeah, my voice is magic, or it's boring.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.890
No way. I loved it.

14:51.390 --> 14:55.227
Curled up on the couch listening to you,
that always made me feel safe.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.770
Glad to know it.

15:08.824 --> 15:09.867
Oh.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.920
All right. What do we have?

15:21.003 --> 15:22.922
Okay.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.932
"It is truth universally acknowledged

15:33.015 --> 15:35.517
that a single man
in possession of a good fortune

15:35.601 --> 15:38.062
must be in want of a wife."

15:38.145 --> 15:39.021
What?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.607
You don't have to agree. Just read.

15:41.690 --> 15:47.029
No, I was just… I was just thinking,
well, you're my fortune.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.662
"However little known the feelings
or views of such a man

15:54.745 --> 15:57.456
may be on his first entering
a neighborhood,

15:57.539 --> 16:01.335
this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families

16:01.418 --> 16:03.796
that he is considered
as the rightful property…"

16:12.763 --> 16:15.474
It's times like this
I wish my mama were still here.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.103
Man, I would look her in the eye

16:19.186 --> 16:23.857
and apologize for every single time
I made her worry.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.862
You were a good daughter.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.656
I dunno.

16:30.739 --> 16:34.827
And you <i>have </i>a good daughter.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.454
Yeah.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.625
It's been a bad night!

16:41.709 --> 16:43.544
-Yeah.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.130
But morning's coming, and, uh,

16:47.256 --> 16:49.425
everyone will mend eventually.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.343
Yeah, I know. It's…

16:52.761 --> 16:54.346
it's that I keep, like…

16:55.139 --> 16:58.017
I keep thinking about my baby girl,
and I don't…

16:58.892 --> 17:02.938
-I don't even-- You know…
-Dana Sue. Don't swallow the storm.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.443
If I let this out…

17:08.068 --> 17:09.278
Lord help me.

17:11.447 --> 17:15.492
I would ask what else could go wrong,
but I'm not sure I wanna know.

17:15.576 --> 17:19.204
You are holding up beautifully,
my dear.

17:20.372 --> 17:24.460
I hate how quiet the house is. It just…

17:26.503 --> 17:30.090
Even when all the kids are here
and they're asleep, it sounds different.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.470
With just Tyler here, it sounds

17:35.971 --> 17:36.805
wrong.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.640
Shall we turn on some music?

17:38.724 --> 17:42.311
We can sing and recite poetry.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.730
-We could play charades. Or poker.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.858
I do not know
how I could get there from here.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.068
Get some sleep.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.946
Few good decisions
are made between midnight and dawn.

17:53.030 --> 17:56.075
And we're here, with you,
you know, as long as you need us.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.410
Forever?

17:58.994 --> 18:00.370
That can be arranged.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.188
Yeah.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.358
Hey, how are
Maddie and the boys?

19:53.442 --> 19:56.028
Um, just gonna take some time.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.404
Yeah, with Annie too.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.448
Over here.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.246
Did Annie say something?

20:08.165 --> 20:11.960
Yeah. She's, um…
she's feeling responsible somehow.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.629
This is all on the boys.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.715
I think she was just trying to express

20:16.798 --> 20:19.927
how frustrating it is
when you wanna help someone and you can't.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.679
And I… I don't mean to upset you
by saying something.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.848
I just thought I'd share with you.

20:24.932 --> 20:28.143
No, you're good. Thank you for telling me.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.021
We're both gonna look after
our little girl, you know?

20:31.521 --> 20:33.023
No matter where we are with each other.

20:34.566 --> 20:38.695
And where is that, exactly?

20:38.779 --> 20:41.657
Merciful heaven,
Ronnie Sullivan…

20:41.740 --> 20:44.409
…we're not picking up
that conversation tonight.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.746
Or this morning or whatever it is.

20:48.538 --> 20:51.583
You are busier than a cat
in a room full of rocking chairs,

20:51.667 --> 20:53.043
and you keep adding chairs.

20:53.126 --> 20:56.213
Why don't I stay in town
and help you through it all?

20:56.296 --> 20:59.007
While respecting
any and all boundaries you draw.

21:01.969 --> 21:06.306
Besides… Annie and I
didn't get all that far in the book,

21:06.390 --> 21:09.685
and I need to make sure
ol' Lizzie Bennet is making good choices.

21:17.025 --> 21:20.320
Nana let me use her special art pens.
And she checked my spelling.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.488
Aw.

21:21.571 --> 21:22.656
She didn't need much help

21:22.739 --> 21:25.701
once we swapped out
the word "recuperate" for "heal."

21:25.784 --> 21:27.786
Well, these are wonderful.

21:27.869 --> 21:30.539
Thank you both.
Your brothers are gonna love them.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.541
Made you one too, Mommy.

21:33.333 --> 21:36.211
Thank you, sweetie! But I am fine.

21:36.753 --> 21:39.881
No, you're sad,
and I don't want you to be sad.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.262
Even though it's okay to be sad sometimes.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.181
Baby.

21:48.849 --> 21:49.975
Can I go see Ty?

21:51.143 --> 21:53.854
Yes, but tiptoe.

21:53.937 --> 21:56.064
And if he is sleeping, do not wake him up.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.107
-Okay.
-Okay.

22:01.194 --> 22:04.239
What did I do
to deserve such an amazing daughter?

22:06.199 --> 22:08.952
A question I ask <i>myself</i> every day.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.458
Oh, Mom, I should have seen this coming.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.378
I will not listen to such nonsense.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.672
And on the Lord's day?

22:21.590 --> 22:23.592
The best mother in the world

22:24.843 --> 22:27.304
cannot protect her child from every hurt.

22:28.263 --> 22:32.351
She can only be there
to help her child work through the pain.

22:33.977 --> 22:34.936
And she does,

22:35.854 --> 22:37.898
over and over again.

23:16.311 --> 23:19.564
This looks like all roads
lead to Kyle this morning.

23:19.648 --> 23:22.859
Yeah, I was just coming by
to check on him before I went to church.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.862
Oh, church.
I don't know if I'm ready for that.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.280
You mean all the questions

23:27.364 --> 23:29.533
and the attitudes
from the people <i>at</i> church?

23:29.616 --> 23:30.450
Don't you worry.

23:30.534 --> 23:33.245
I will go. I will spread good information.

23:33.328 --> 23:36.581
And I will try to control the flood
of casseroles that are coming your way.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.083
-Thank you.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.876
-I'm gonna head in.
-Okay.

23:44.673 --> 23:45.507
You all right?

23:45.590 --> 23:47.926
Excuse me. That's my question for you.

23:48.009 --> 23:51.638
I just… You and Howie
were in quite the conversation.

23:51.721 --> 23:55.684
I was just telling him how lucky
we all are to have him as a doctor

23:55.767 --> 23:56.685
and as a friend.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.562
Hm. Mm.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.731
Why don't you go on in and be with Kyle?

24:02.232 --> 24:03.817
I will go pray up a storm,

24:04.526 --> 24:07.195
and, uh, I'll come by later
to check on him.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.031
-And you.
-Mm.

24:10.574 --> 24:11.783
-And Ty.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.162
-Thank you for everything.
-Aw.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.121
Always.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.551
-Good morning!

25:11.635 --> 25:14.054
Hey. You know, there's no disgrace
in making a second trip

25:14.137 --> 25:16.139
or letting me know you're here, all right?

25:16.223 --> 25:17.265
Let me grab this.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.685
I should've called and made sure
your staff was here to help with hauling.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.688
Well, they had a late night
or early morning,

25:23.772 --> 25:25.774
so I just told them to roll in easy.

25:25.857 --> 25:26.942
Everybody okay?

25:27.025 --> 25:28.860
Uh, actually, no.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.071
But they will be, thank the merciful Lord.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.782
But you know what?
I don't wanna get into it right now,

25:33.865 --> 25:35.825
and I'd really like to think about
something else.

25:35.909 --> 25:39.162
So why don't you show me what you've got?

25:39.246 --> 25:40.622
I have everything you need.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.375
Oh.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.211
Well, I do like 'em firm.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.714
More important, they're sweet.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.593
Uh…

25:57.973 --> 25:59.015
Good morning!

25:59.099 --> 26:01.685
-It would seem to be!
-Didn't mean to interrupt.

26:01.768 --> 26:04.187
-Y'all can come back in here.
-They can?

26:04.271 --> 26:06.439
Morning, Chef. Sorry, Jeremy.

26:06.523 --> 26:10.527
Yes, they can come in, and you have to go,
or I won't get a lick of work done.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.737
Here I thought we were working right well.

26:14.030 --> 26:16.616
It's your kitchen, your rules.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.327
-Gentlemen.
-Jeremy.

26:20.870 --> 26:23.331
We, uh, didn't expect to see you here.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.833
Ronnie's with Annie.

26:24.916 --> 26:29.170
She's sleeping in, you know,
which is sometimes the best medicine, so…

26:31.298 --> 26:33.174
Y'all gonna smirk at me all day?

26:33.258 --> 26:35.302
Uh, maybe just till the end of brunch.

26:35.885 --> 26:38.263
Where's the ambition? Dinner.

26:39.723 --> 26:43.226
All right, fine, then.
Y'all have your fun.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.270
-'Cause it is so worth it.
-Ooh.

26:45.895 --> 26:49.024
First one to make a nectarine joke
cleans the grill with a toothbrush.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.568
Might be so worth it.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.238
Thanks for the card, Katie.

26:55.322 --> 26:58.033
I'll make you one every day
till you come home.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.703
-Do we know when that's gonna be?
-No, not yet.

27:02.996 --> 27:06.750
Kyle, I can understand
<i>what</i> happened last night,

27:06.833 --> 27:09.336
but for the life of me,
I can't understand <i>why</i>.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.129
Mom said we could talk later.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.548
My leg hurts. When's my next pill?

27:14.966 --> 27:16.926
Good morning. Mind if I join you?

27:17.010 --> 27:19.137
Pastor June,
how lovely to see you!

27:19.220 --> 27:20.347
Thanks for coming by.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.766
Oh, I can take these. Thank you.

27:23.391 --> 27:26.019
I'm sorry we didn't make it to church
this morning.

27:26.102 --> 27:28.521
You are right where you need to be.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.523
And when people can't come to worship,

27:30.607 --> 27:33.360
I am more than happy
to bring worship to them.

27:33.443 --> 27:34.819
Good morning, Kyle.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.614
Helen shared with me
what happened to you and your brother,

27:37.697 --> 27:38.990
so I came to check on you.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.159
Glad you have
your whole family here with you.

27:41.242 --> 27:43.787
We're gonna get them both back to 100%.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.623
Didn't have to come
just to see me, Pastor.

27:46.706 --> 27:50.293
Truth be told, Kyle, I call
at the hospital every Sunday afternoon

27:50.377 --> 27:52.003
to see Prince of Peace folks.

27:52.087 --> 27:55.965
Gladys McLean had her hip replaced
on Friday, so she's my next visit.

27:56.049 --> 27:59.177
I just figured you're here to tell me
how God forgives me, all that stuff.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.553
Kyle.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.640
I hoped you already knew "all that stuff."

28:03.723 --> 28:04.849
I did.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.894
Maybe the harder thing today

28:07.977 --> 28:11.898
is to forgive yourself or someone else.

28:13.358 --> 28:16.194
-Let's all forgive each other.
-Not how this works, Katie.

28:16.778 --> 28:17.946
Isn't it though?

28:18.029 --> 28:21.950
Why don't we all take a moment
as a group, a… a family,

28:22.450 --> 28:27.789
and lay down our burdens,
fear, regret, anger,

28:28.373 --> 28:32.627
and open up our hearts
to receive forgiveness and love?

28:48.727 --> 28:50.270
Maddie, what's going on?

28:51.980 --> 28:53.314
Go back in there, Bill.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.192
Well, that's not an answer.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.819
'Cause I don't have one.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.448
What if I can't forgive you?
What if I don't want to?

29:02.407 --> 29:04.617
Let's stay focused on the boys.

29:04.701 --> 29:07.162
I <i>am</i> focused on the boys,

29:07.245 --> 29:12.000
and every time I try to figure out
when things started falling apart…

29:14.377 --> 29:17.213
God may be able to forgive you,
but I can't.

29:17.297 --> 29:20.717
I might be able to one day because I know
that's what I'm supposed to do,

29:20.800 --> 29:25.805
but even then, I need you to understand

29:26.765 --> 29:29.726
I am <i>never </i>taking you back.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.478
We're done.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.231
Finished. Over.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.027
-Uh…

30:04.052 --> 30:05.553
I should have stayed with you.

30:05.637 --> 30:06.471
Not at all.

30:07.263 --> 30:09.516
I'm just sorry
the night ended the way it did.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.894
I had a really great time up until then.

30:12.977 --> 30:13.853
Me too.

30:15.355 --> 30:17.941
I wish I wasn't leaving for DC so soon,

30:18.024 --> 30:20.860
but my cousin's internship starts
before mine, and if I don't drive up--

30:20.944 --> 30:23.196
Don't apologize. I'm so excited for you.

30:23.780 --> 30:27.116
I mean, working on Capitol Hill,
that's crazy cool!

30:27.200 --> 30:29.452
You're gonna learn so much
and have so much fun.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.496
-I'll miss you.
-No, you won't.

30:32.163 --> 30:36.084
Text me anytime something cool happens
and tell me all about it. Please.

30:38.711 --> 30:39.712
Promise.

30:50.348 --> 30:53.810
Ah! You are a sight for sore eyes!

30:55.103 --> 30:57.939
I am so glad to see you, Cal.

30:59.190 --> 31:02.986
Oh, and, uh, I know someone else
who will be too.

31:12.036 --> 31:15.790
I didn't know that your culinary skills
extended to casseroles.

31:15.874 --> 31:16.833
Here's the thing.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.254
Do my eyes deceive me…

31:21.337 --> 31:23.882
…or is that Wharton's pizza
cut into squares?

31:24.465 --> 31:26.467
-It… it wouldn't fit otherwise.
-Oh!

31:26.551 --> 31:28.344
And extra pepperoni?

31:28.428 --> 31:31.264
I'm pretty sure the road to heaven
is paved in pepperoni.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.641
Trotter and Harlan both told me

31:33.725 --> 31:36.769
that the proper Southern thing
was to bring a casserole,

31:36.853 --> 31:39.230
but I thought
maybe Katie would want something

31:39.314 --> 31:41.691
other than meatloaf and chicken divan.

31:41.774 --> 31:43.484
Oh, extra points.

31:43.568 --> 31:48.656
I'll go let Katie know
while, um, you two, uh, talk.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.204
Ty's upstairs.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.124
How's he doing?

31:59.250 --> 32:02.378
Still working through
that he's not going to State.

32:03.796 --> 32:05.173
Yeah, he must be heartbroken.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.257
Mm-hmm.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.720
I mean, you could… you could go on up.

32:11.304 --> 32:14.015
He's kinda hard to lure down
these days…

32:14.098 --> 32:15.850
…although pizza may help.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.854
I do wanna talk to him,

32:21.105 --> 32:23.733
but I wanna check on you first,
see how you're doing.

32:23.816 --> 32:27.946
And I mean that just as a friend,
in case that's all we are right now.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.157
Okay.

32:34.243 --> 32:37.830
I know that I did not handle
the scout situation well.

32:38.414 --> 32:40.750
Uh, that's not what I'm saying, please.

32:40.833 --> 32:46.881
No, I know that you are not digging
for an apology…

32:46.965 --> 32:48.675
…although you do deserve one.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.679
-I could have handled it better.
-No, I understand.

32:55.390 --> 32:56.557
Here is the thing.

32:58.142 --> 33:02.313
You pushed a lot of buttons
that Bill installed,

33:02.397 --> 33:03.564
and you had no way of knowing,

33:03.648 --> 33:07.110
and I could have been
more clear or patient.

33:08.152 --> 33:11.239
I could have been, um,
more of a team player.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.161
You stood up for your son.

33:18.371 --> 33:19.372
I respect that.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.377
My boys and I have a steep hill to climb.

33:26.462 --> 33:31.217
I would welcome the company on the journey

33:32.218 --> 33:33.594
if you're still interested.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.807
I'm already imagining
the beautiful scenery.

33:54.490 --> 33:58.036
You know the best part
of me being a teacher?

33:59.037 --> 34:00.997
You have things that you wanna teach me?

34:01.497 --> 34:02.832
-Oh, absolutely.

34:02.915 --> 34:04.876
I think I have a list somewhere,

34:04.959 --> 34:07.503
which is why I am glad
that I have the whole summer for you

34:07.587 --> 34:11.674
to focus on the things that I care about,
including you.

34:12.592 --> 34:13.509
Thank you.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.388
What are some of the other things?

34:17.472 --> 34:20.391
I mean, I can help you at the spa,
with the kids.

34:20.475 --> 34:24.645
Your mom is frighteningly self-sufficient,
so she's not gonna make the list.

34:24.729 --> 34:26.981
I appreciate that. I really do.

34:28.024 --> 34:32.111
And I am really glad
that we get to spend more time together.

34:32.695 --> 34:34.822
Unfortunately,
I do not have a summer vacation.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.199
You're absolutely right.

34:37.408 --> 34:39.077
Sorry, I just, uh…

34:39.619 --> 34:42.705
I've never actually
had a summer off before.

34:42.789 --> 34:45.374
I'll find something
worthwhile to do, promise.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.919
No. No, I didn't…
I didn't mean it like that.

34:49.378 --> 34:50.505
Don't do it for me.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.215
Do it for you.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.674
I'll do it for both of us.

35:00.681 --> 35:02.308
Better make
yourselves presentable.

35:02.391 --> 35:06.604
I'm about to open the door,
and God only knows who might be coming in.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.616
Well, I'm glad to know
that some folks in this house are healthy.

35:22.870 --> 35:26.207
And, um, It's good to know
that you two are working things out.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.251
Hey, Helen, what's in your casserole?

35:28.876 --> 35:31.379
-Mama Decatur's lemon bars.
-My favorite!

35:31.462 --> 35:33.798
It is what I always bring
to such a situation.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.967
My mama taught me to bring bars

35:36.050 --> 35:39.428
because everyone else
is bringing hearty meals and vegetables.

35:39.512 --> 35:40.888
Oh, or pizza!

35:40.972 --> 35:42.181
Who brought…

35:43.599 --> 35:45.101
Hmm.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.645
And… …she believed

35:47.728 --> 35:50.690
that sweets soothe
the soul like nothing else can.

35:50.773 --> 35:53.359
Mamas know all the secrets.

35:53.442 --> 35:54.402
Mm.

36:02.660 --> 36:05.288
I heard the poor boy
may not walk again. Is that true?

36:05.371 --> 36:07.748
I'm sure
your amazingly detailed questions

36:07.832 --> 36:09.125
are coming from a place of love.

36:09.208 --> 36:12.336
I'll be sure and pass along
your best wishes to Maddie and her family.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.504
Have a great workout!

36:15.423 --> 36:16.340
Thank you!

36:21.012 --> 36:22.597
Helen…

36:22.680 --> 36:24.807
…please save me from the jackdaws!

36:24.891 --> 36:28.644
Are you being besieged by wagging tongues
and vivid imaginations?

36:28.728 --> 36:29.645
Eh…

36:30.354 --> 36:32.231
I'm thinking of posting a sign here

36:32.315 --> 36:35.735
that says, "Maddie needs your prayers,
not your gossip."

36:35.818 --> 36:37.904
I shudder to think
what the Serenity rumor mill

36:37.987 --> 36:39.197
is gonna do with all this.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.824
Well, if I didn't care so much
about Maddie and her boys,

36:41.908 --> 36:45.578
I might be impressed by how quickly
myths and legends about last night

36:45.661 --> 36:46.704
have sprung up.

36:46.787 --> 36:49.165
The devil may make work for idle hands,

36:49.248 --> 36:51.751
but he accomplishes even more
with empty minds.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.211
There's a whole collection of those

36:53.294 --> 36:55.588
headed to the yoga studio,
just so you know.

36:55.671 --> 36:59.133
Thanks for the warning,
but I'm about to head out.

37:00.509 --> 37:03.429
Are you all right
pulling double duty yet again?

37:05.556 --> 37:07.892
Double duty is starting to feel
like regular duty,

37:07.975 --> 37:10.728
and I thank y'all for trusting me with it.

37:11.229 --> 37:15.399
And I'll do whatever else is needed.
Just say the word.

37:21.155 --> 37:22.573
Bless you, Trotter.

37:27.036 --> 37:30.164
How can I help you today
with any spa-related question?

37:30.790 --> 37:32.792
-Well, hi, Helen.
-Hey.

37:52.687 --> 37:53.729
Good afternoon.

37:55.564 --> 37:58.818
Am I catching you
at a nice time for a little chat?

38:00.361 --> 38:02.738
No, nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.784
You're not hearing anything in my voice,

38:07.493 --> 38:11.330
except, um, maybe how much I miss you,

38:12.498 --> 38:13.374
Mama.

38:17.712 --> 38:20.923
If you're so sure
that you're hearing something,

38:21.007 --> 38:22.800
maybe I should just stop talking,

38:22.883 --> 38:25.970
and you can just let me know
how your week has been.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.940
Yeah. Well, I wouldn't trust a woman

38:38.024 --> 38:40.568
who puts raisins
in her potato salad either.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.118
I'm awake, Dr. Ahmed.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.876
Nellie! Hey.

38:56.959 --> 39:00.129
I just wanted to be sure you were alone.

39:00.212 --> 39:01.464
Is it all right I'm here?

39:02.048 --> 39:03.549
I… I don't know. Is it?

39:04.759 --> 39:05.801
Are you okay?

39:07.845 --> 39:09.055
Better than you are.

39:09.555 --> 39:11.182
Yeah, good.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.518
I mean, good for you. I'm not as good.

39:16.812 --> 39:18.939
My parents wouldn't tell me anything,

39:19.023 --> 39:22.526
and people at church were saying
the craziest things…

39:22.610 --> 39:25.321
…so I had to come see you for myself.

39:25.404 --> 39:27.281
My parents went to lunch with the Cleggs,

39:27.365 --> 39:31.952
and I need to get home before they do,
so I can't stay.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.706
It's a get-well present.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.668
Go on. You can open it.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.843
It's <i>Ghost: In the Smoke and Din.</i>

39:47.927 --> 39:50.388
It's about this assassin
who can't remember who she is,

39:50.471 --> 39:52.723
but she was so good at being invisible

39:52.807 --> 39:55.101
that she starts to believe
that she's actually a ghost.

39:55.184 --> 39:57.853
And there are these people
who can see her,

39:58.396 --> 40:00.940
and I hope you like it.

40:01.440 --> 40:04.235
Sounds awesome. Thanks.

40:04.819 --> 40:05.945
It's okay, Kyle.

40:06.028 --> 40:09.156
It's not, Nellie. I did this whole thing.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.992
-I just wanted to help you.
-And that means a lot, okay?

40:12.076 --> 40:13.828
But then I turn around, and I could…

40:16.831 --> 40:17.998
I could have hurt you.

40:18.582 --> 40:19.750
But you didn't.

40:20.626 --> 40:24.964
And I just wanted you to know
I'm… I'm not mad about it.

40:26.549 --> 40:28.008
My parents are.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.179
But I'm not.

40:33.722 --> 40:34.932
I forgive you.

40:43.774 --> 40:44.775
Get better, Kyle.

40:54.743 --> 40:57.079
Grilled catfish
and your taco platter.

40:57.163 --> 40:59.498
Isaac, why don't you get
the lamb shanks prepped

40:59.582 --> 41:01.041
while I look after the orange roughy?

41:01.125 --> 41:02.877
-No problem.
-Well, hello there.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.962
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon, gentlemen.

41:05.045 --> 41:07.381
Chef ran home to check on Annie,
but she should be back soon.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.507
Okay, thank you.

41:10.009 --> 41:11.594
It's a pleasure to have you visit.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.597
You don't have to pitch in.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.557
I just got off the phone
with my mother,

41:16.640 --> 41:20.060
and I now have a hankering to cook
that will not be denied.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.771
So put me to work, Chef!

41:22.855 --> 41:25.816
I made pecan tarts last night
because I miss my grandmother.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.527
When I cook one of my grandmama's recipes,

41:28.611 --> 41:31.655
it's like conjuring her up
so she can stand beside me

41:31.739 --> 41:33.866
and tell me I'm stingy with my spices.

41:34.909 --> 41:37.328
You do not strike me as a man
with that issue.

41:40.998 --> 41:44.877
Is there anything I can help you with?
Or did talking to your mama sort it out?

41:48.756 --> 41:50.758
I'm fine, for the moment.

41:51.425 --> 41:55.429
But I'm glad to know
that I can call on you

41:55.513 --> 41:58.933
if I stop being fine.

42:00.976 --> 42:02.228
You're required to do so.

42:06.607 --> 42:08.317
Okay, so what are we doing?

43:12.506 --> 43:15.926
-Pour it out.
-God bless us and everyone.

43:16.010 --> 43:18.512
How's, um… how's Ty?

43:18.596 --> 43:22.600
Well, he's still grappling with the fact
that he can't go to State.

43:23.142 --> 43:23.976
And Kyle?

43:25.269 --> 43:28.814
Still grappling with the fact
that it could have been so much worse.

43:29.648 --> 43:31.650
-Amen.
-I'm still trying to take it in.

43:31.734 --> 43:33.235
I don't even know what to do.

43:33.319 --> 43:36.488
Then if Trent and Mary Vaughn
sue us on top of everything else, I--

43:36.572 --> 43:38.991
Don't you add
another ounce of worry to that.

43:39.074 --> 43:40.451
I will deal with Trent,

43:40.534 --> 43:43.662
if there's actually anything
to his hollering, which I doubt there is.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.998
Thank you. I will take one less worry.

43:46.498 --> 43:47.916
And then Dr. Ahmed called me

43:48.000 --> 43:50.753
and said Kyle
is gonna be coming home in a wheelchair.

43:50.836 --> 43:51.670
Oh!

43:51.754 --> 43:54.340
Because he hurt his back
along with his knee.

43:54.423 --> 43:55.716
Will you need a ramp?

43:55.799 --> 43:58.302
Skeeter will have a crew out here
in a hot minute if you do.

43:58.385 --> 43:59.928
Yeah. No, I'll ask her.

44:00.012 --> 44:02.723
After I talk to Principal Puckett
about what I'm doing.

44:02.806 --> 44:03.682
And then Ty…

44:03.766 --> 44:06.852
-Oh. Oh, stop it. Just stop me!

44:06.935 --> 44:10.022
How are you two? I would love to hear
about someone else's life for a second.

44:10.105 --> 44:12.733
Well, here's one for you. Uh, Isaac Downey

44:13.609 --> 44:15.611
wants me to be his mother.

44:15.694 --> 44:16.528
What?

44:16.612 --> 44:18.822
Well, last night, right before,

44:18.906 --> 44:22.368
he was telling me that he's adopted,
and he's looking for his birth mother,

44:22.451 --> 44:24.161
and he thought it might be me.

44:24.244 --> 44:27.289
-Why? No offense, of course.
-He clearly has excellent taste.

44:27.373 --> 44:30.834
It's a really sweet thing. All he knows
is that his birth mother is from Serenity,

44:30.918 --> 44:34.505
so I promised him that we would
help him figure out who she is.

44:34.588 --> 44:36.757
Of course we will. How old is he?

44:36.840 --> 44:38.175
Twenty-two.

44:38.258 --> 44:41.011
I'm trying to remember
any failed marriages around then.

44:41.553 --> 44:44.807
Well, maybe it wasn't an affair.
Maybe she was just a single mom.

44:44.890 --> 44:48.268
I have been racking my brain,
but I have yet to come up with a suspect.

44:48.352 --> 44:51.188
Every once in a while,
this town <i>can </i>keep a secret.

44:51.271 --> 44:53.691
-It doesn't mean we can't uncover it.

44:53.774 --> 44:55.776
I really would love to help him.

44:55.859 --> 44:59.488
I mean, he is
such a… a good young man, you know?

44:59.571 --> 45:02.157
And I don't… I don't know
what I would do without him and Erik.

45:02.241 --> 45:04.159
How did Erik know to come to the hospital?

45:04.243 --> 45:06.286
-He was with me when you called.
-Oh!

45:06.370 --> 45:08.038
Oh, stop it!

45:08.122 --> 45:10.332
He brought me brownies because someone…

45:10.416 --> 45:12.626
Oh.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.670
…told him that Ryan left.

45:14.753 --> 45:17.840
I mean, I have heard
of wooing with chocolate…

45:17.923 --> 45:20.634
…but brownies
are a lovely elevation.

45:20.718 --> 45:23.512
There's no wooing!
He's just being a good friend, that's all.

45:23.595 --> 45:26.390
Just because the two of you
have man-nonsense going on,

45:26.473 --> 45:27.641
you needn't put that on me.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.393
Man-nonsense? What are you talking about?

45:29.476 --> 45:31.437
Maybe I'm talking about you and Cal,

45:31.520 --> 45:34.314
and maybe I'm talking about this one
and all of her men.

45:34.398 --> 45:36.066
-Okay.

45:36.150 --> 45:40.612
So, Serenity's cutest couple
is back on track?

45:40.696 --> 45:43.741
Oh, I thought that title
was currently held by you and Jeremy?

45:43.824 --> 45:45.576
Oh wait, no, maybe you and Ronnie.

45:45.659 --> 45:47.870
-No. No!

45:47.953 --> 45:50.998
Ronnie and me is a practical thing.

45:51.081 --> 45:56.795
Jeremy and me is probably
an impractical thing.

45:56.879 --> 45:59.006
I don't know.
I… I gotta figure it all out,

45:59.089 --> 46:01.425
but… I don't know,

46:01.508 --> 46:06.096
it kinda has been nice to have Ronnie to,

46:07.431 --> 46:09.224
you know, help Annie with…

46:09.308 --> 46:12.770
How is Annie? She sure has had
a front-row seat to all this.

46:12.853 --> 46:14.772
Hasn't she though.

46:16.482 --> 46:17.733
Dana Sue?

46:17.816 --> 46:20.319
Can we not talk
about this tonight, please?

46:21.069 --> 46:24.448
Well, it kinda seems like we have to.

46:24.948 --> 46:28.744
No. No, because it's all
I have been thinking about.

46:30.204 --> 46:34.291
See, all I can picture
when I close my eyes, to so much as blink,

46:34.958 --> 46:38.003
is that my kid
could have been in that car.

46:38.086 --> 46:40.714
-But how can I say that when you--
-You just say it.

46:42.007 --> 46:44.051
Lord knows I don't wanna take away
from anything

46:44.134 --> 46:47.387
that you are going through right now,
but I just…

46:47.471 --> 46:49.223
She is all I have.

46:49.306 --> 46:50.891
That is it.

46:50.974 --> 46:53.435
And she has been through so much,

46:53.519 --> 46:55.687
and she's always been there
for those boys.

46:55.771 --> 46:59.149
So why is it always the loyal one,
the faithful friend,

46:59.233 --> 47:03.111
who's supposed to absorb
every twist and kick that life delivers

47:03.195 --> 47:06.615
and still come up smiling
when she deserves some attention?

47:06.698 --> 47:10.077
And she deserves some concern

47:10.160 --> 47:13.330
because being the strong one
is exhausting!

47:13.413 --> 47:15.541
-Dana Sue--
-No. No one gets that!

47:15.624 --> 47:17.626
Dana Sue,
we need to talk this out.

47:17.709 --> 47:19.336
It's been a rough couple of days, just--

47:19.419 --> 47:22.881
I think I'm gonna go home
and, uh… and be with my daughter.

47:22.965 --> 47:24.132
Dana Sue.

47:24.216 --> 47:25.092
It's…

47:31.098 --> 47:32.558
Well, that caught me napping.

47:32.641 --> 47:35.310
When was the last time one of us
walked out on a margarita night?

47:35.394 --> 47:37.896
-It's been quite a while.
-Should I go after her?

47:37.980 --> 47:39.064
I don't think so.

47:41.608 --> 47:42.568
I mean,

47:43.735 --> 47:47.114
it's not like Kyle would ever hurt anyone.

47:47.197 --> 47:49.867
He'd never deliberately hurt anyone.
I would never hurt anyone.

47:49.950 --> 47:52.953
-I'm just trying to hold it together--
-You take a breath and take a sip.

47:53.537 --> 47:56.248
-Take a sip with me.
-No, no, I'm…

47:56.331 --> 47:57.541
Goodness, I'm all right.

47:58.709 --> 47:59.877
Are you saying I'm wrong?

47:59.960 --> 48:01.920
No, no.

48:08.135 --> 48:09.970
I'm saying that I'm pregnant.
