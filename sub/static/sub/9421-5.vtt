00:00.200 --> 00:04.310
My father worked as a lawyer
for the richest family in New York

00:04.410 --> 00:07.190
until his plane went
down in long island sound.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.122
He left me his biggest client,

00:09.242 --> 00:11.103
the Darlings-- Tripp and leticia...

00:11.234 --> 00:13.668
Which of our children isn't mine?

00:13.814 --> 00:16.904
I'll tell you, but you've got to
promise me nothing will change.

00:17.024 --> 00:18.190
Brian, the man of God.

00:18.325 --> 00:19.776
I lied to my wife
and daughters.

00:19.861 --> 00:21.421
I told them that
you were an orphan.

00:21.550 --> 00:23.647
Do you really believe
his name is Gustav?

00:23.791 --> 00:26.411
Patrick, the principled politician,

00:26.497 --> 00:27.957
Karen, the professional divorcee.

00:28.042 --> 00:29.773
- Nick proposed to you?
- When we were 19.

00:29.865 --> 00:31.055
Why didn't you tell her?

00:31.166 --> 00:33.535
Nick is my past.
You're my future, okay?

00:33.670 --> 00:35.800
And Jeremy and Juliet, the
well-behaved twins.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.260
That's your girlfriend?

00:37.360 --> 00:40.003
She was my best friend in the
whole world, and I hate her guts.

00:40.131 --> 00:41.161
I'm pregnant.

00:41.310 --> 00:43.553
I think my father was working
for someone called "c.

00:43.681 --> 00:46.108
You think Simon elder
blew up your father's plane?

01:04.840 --> 01:06.530
Nicholas George?

01:06.839 --> 01:07.650
Yeah.

01:07.786 --> 01:09.320
Simon elder.

01:09.515 --> 01:10.761
Want to go for a ride?

01:11.550 --> 01:12.565
Yeah, sure.

01:14.607 --> 01:15.607
So, Nick,

01:16.260 --> 01:18.886
the police contacted me,
on your behalf, in a sense.

01:18.994 --> 01:20.746
I assume that's what
you wanted them to do

01:20.838 --> 01:23.038
given the materials you found
in your dad's briefcase.

01:23.130 --> 01:25.850
But you are Simon elder,
one of the world's richest men.

01:25.950 --> 01:28.030
I didn't think they'd actually
get you on the phone

01:28.130 --> 01:29.754
no. They came to my office.

01:29.897 --> 01:31.310
Detective larrabee, I believe.

01:31.410 --> 01:33.951
I'd have done the same thing
if I were in your position.

01:34.083 --> 01:35.470
No hard feelings.

01:35.570 --> 01:37.080
So did you know my father?

01:37.180 --> 01:39.490
Sure, listen, everybody
knew Dutch.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.663
To get anything done in
New York City, you had to.

01:41.809 --> 01:43.988
I guess I'm asking if you knew him
better than that.

01:44.078 --> 01:46.212
If you did some sort
of business with him? Because--

01:46.297 --> 01:48.163
you know
I've been following your career

01:48.285 --> 01:50.493
from a distance
for many years now.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.253
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:52.349 --> 01:54.583
And I've always felt that--
that we're cut

01:54.705 --> 01:56.566
from the same cloth, you and me.

01:57.387 --> 01:58.756
In what way, exactly?

01:58.888 --> 02:01.662
We're both trying to take the
advantages we've been given in life

02:01.756 --> 02:04.247
and share them with those
who are less fortunate.

02:04.410 --> 02:05.600
That sound like you?

02:05.700 --> 02:07.274
Yeah, on a good day.

02:07.378 --> 02:09.256
Sounds like me too, on a good day.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.969
Dryton, stop the car, please.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.434
Listen Nick, I would love

02:12.557 --> 02:15.488
to talk to you about
your dad and the Darlings,

02:15.664 --> 02:17.970
but I gotta catch a
flight right now to Haiti

02:18.100 --> 02:20.630
we're giving away 10,000 free
laptops to schoolkids down there

02:20.726 --> 02:23.350
and installing free wireless
all over port-au-prince.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.910
Totally your kind of thing.

02:25.010 --> 02:26.488
So if we can do dinner,

02:26.618 --> 02:28.825
I know this great little Russian
restaurant in Brooklyn.

02:28.945 --> 02:32.380
If this sounds interesting to
you, have your secretary set it up.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.683
No pressure.

02:34.407 --> 02:35.234
Okay.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.911
A church ceremony is out.

02:44.297 --> 02:46.454
But, Brian, you promised
me you would at least try.

02:46.594 --> 02:47.940
I did.

02:48.108 --> 02:50.305
But... for some reason,

02:50.429 --> 02:53.523
the bishop felt that using the chapel
for your fourth marriage

02:53.673 --> 02:56.977
would just be a little bit insulting
to the rest of the marrying public.

02:57.121 --> 02:59.477
Okay, fine.
We'll have the ceremony here.

02:59.612 --> 03:00.640
So are we done?

03:00.740 --> 03:03.566
'Cause I have to get home to
my wife and kids for dinner.

03:03.698 --> 03:06.390
Oh, and that cute
little orphan boy, too.

03:06.490 --> 03:09.470
Yeah, oh, baby, I been thinking
about my bachelor party,

03:09.570 --> 03:12.230
maybe taking the plane
to Cuba with the guys.

03:13.149 --> 03:14.169
You in?

03:14.270 --> 03:15.850
- Yeah, I'm in.
- Really?

03:15.950 --> 03:18.380
My minister brother is gonna
go to a bachelor party?

03:18.480 --> 03:19.570
Really?

03:19.670 --> 03:21.348
No, not really.

03:22.084 --> 03:25.604
Sweetie, I don't think daddy wants you
to take the plane again.

03:26.430 --> 03:29.552
Jet fuel doesn't grow on trees.

03:29.681 --> 03:32.638
Karen, you just took the plane to
Los Angeles last week for Sushi.

03:32.764 --> 03:35.920
Right. It's just, I think
daddy doesn't want...

03:36.020 --> 03:39.169
Some people to take the
plane again... this month.

03:39.338 --> 03:41.367
But baby, gotta have a bachelor party.

03:41.482 --> 03:42.510
It's tradition.

03:43.154 --> 03:44.706
You know what, sweetie?

03:45.041 --> 03:46.452
I'm gonna take care of this.

03:53.150 --> 03:57.037
Well, today's Bible
children's story is...

03:59.660 --> 04:01.905
There it is.
"Kindness."

04:02.028 --> 04:03.965
No, that's not
the reading for tonight.

04:04.106 --> 04:06.381
- It is. It says so right here.
- No.

04:06.495 --> 04:08.807
See, that's... for tomorrow night.

04:08.929 --> 04:11.633
Well, mommy's been reading ahead.

04:11.766 --> 04:15.023
Read tonight's, Brian, otherwise
everything gets off.

04:15.540 --> 04:17.759
Okay, I'll read tonight's.

04:20.005 --> 04:21.285
"Honesty."

04:22.350 --> 04:25.073
"Of all the sins
that hurt God's feelings,"

04:25.233 --> 04:26.935
"lying is the worst of all."

04:27.066 --> 04:29.760
"In big ways and small ways,"

04:29.880 --> 04:32.800
"lying eats away
at the heart God gave us "

04:32.900 --> 04:35.281
"and leaves us empty and sad."

04:35.820 --> 04:38.389
"If we're going to be happy
and go to heaven,

04:38.509 --> 04:40.321
we have to tell the truth.

04:41.630 --> 04:45.426
Well, I don't think we have
to tell the truth all the time.

04:45.576 --> 04:48.070
I think there are import exceptions.

04:48.170 --> 04:50.490
But-- I these
are good thoughts.

04:50.590 --> 04:53.915
These are definitely good thoughts.

04:56.867 --> 04:58.530
So you think Simon's lying?

04:58.630 --> 05:01.920
He said he didn't know my dad
very well, but I think he did.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.776
I think he was "c.

05:03.899 --> 05:06.087
From your dad's planner, all
those mystery appointments?

05:06.177 --> 05:07.160
Yeah.

05:07.260 --> 05:08.884
What makes you think so?

05:09.395 --> 05:10.967
His license plate.

05:11.050 --> 05:13.072
It's just the letter "c.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.550
Seemed kind of like a fit.

05:15.650 --> 05:17.380
Why would he withhold that from you?

05:17.480 --> 05:19.869
I don't know, but I'm
gonna try and find out.

05:19.979 --> 05:21.754
I'm having dinner with
him later this week.

05:21.871 --> 05:22.946
You're welcome.

05:23.044 --> 05:25.037
What happened to that
painting above the fireplace?

05:25.180 --> 05:27.594
It was on loan from
the gallery, and it sold.

05:28.243 --> 05:29.389
You gonna replace it?

05:29.482 --> 05:31.537
I thought I'd take a walk
through Chelsea tomorrow.

05:31.627 --> 05:34.034
- See if anything leaps out at me.
- All right, go for it.

05:34.673 --> 05:36.610
Sounds more fun than what
I'll be doing tomorrow.

05:36.710 --> 05:38.349
What are you doing tomorrow?

05:38.527 --> 05:42.030
Lisa, it's just another day of me
implementing my immense knowledge

05:42.130 --> 05:44.642
of American jurisprudence instead
of doing my charitable work.

05:44.764 --> 05:45.969
Meaning?

05:46.061 --> 05:47.938
I'm settling a dispute
between the twins about

05:48.040 --> 05:50.184
who can and can't come to
their 25th birthday party.

05:50.274 --> 05:52.280
- Natalie Kimpton.
- Natalie Kimpton.

05:52.450 --> 05:54.154
She's not coming to our party.

05:54.290 --> 05:56.590
Have you even read the
bill of rights lately?

05:56.690 --> 05:59.636
The first amendment clearly
states free assembly.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.680
That means I get to invite
whoever I want, right?

06:01.780 --> 06:03.810
She betrayed me and
stole my twin brother.

06:05.690 --> 06:08.856
Look, Juliet, your birthday party
is the premier event of the season.

06:09.014 --> 06:10.060
I am aware of that.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.714
And there are already over
700 people on the guest list.

06:12.798 --> 06:14.020
You may not even see her.

06:14.103 --> 06:16.794
But she'll be there, like a bomb,
a stink bomb waiting to go off.

06:16.937 --> 06:18.754
I'm getting kinda seriously,
radically fed up

06:18.838 --> 06:20.794
- with your crap about this.
- Well, get in line.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.488
It's my party.
Natalie's coming.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.541
Fine, then I'll have my own party.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.240
Fine, I'll have my own party, too.

06:26.340 --> 06:27.590
I get the house.

06:29.067 --> 06:31.037
You take it.
You take the house.

06:31.195 --> 06:34.008
I'll find someplace cooler,
and no one will come to your party.

06:34.151 --> 06:35.558
No one will come to your party.

06:35.686 --> 06:38.829
You know what? This could work out.
I'll split the million-dollar budget--

06:38.934 --> 06:39.934
are you crazy?

06:40.036 --> 06:43.025
We can't split the money.
I can't throw a party for 500 grand.

06:43.161 --> 06:45.294
Neither can I,
at least not a good one Nick.

06:45.413 --> 06:47.910
- It's economies of scale.
- Do you even know what that means?

06:48.010 --> 06:51.350
No, but you know what I think
I mean, and that's what matters.

06:51.450 --> 06:53.173
We need $2 million.

06:53.263 --> 06:54.335
$2 million?

06:54.461 --> 06:57.043
My God. For parties.

06:57.182 --> 06:59.190
It's their 25th birthday.

06:59.290 --> 07:00.311
Binge drinking,

07:00.431 --> 07:02.080
reckless endangerment.

07:02.239 --> 07:04.040
They're just kids having fun.

07:04.140 --> 07:08.071
Those kids are about to inherit
$25 million apiece,

07:08.191 --> 07:10.429
and they know it.
I mean, call me crazy,

07:10.579 --> 07:12.723
but that makes me expect a...

07:13.397 --> 07:15.137
Little restraint on their part.

07:15.253 --> 07:16.273
$25 million?

07:16.406 --> 07:17.540
It's from my father.

07:17.640 --> 07:18.674
It's a trust.

07:19.030 --> 07:21.327
It's to give them a start in life.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.488
It's their first checkbook.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.863
Patrick bought a summer
house up in Maine.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.872
Karen invested hers.
I mean, smart kids.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.740
Brian traveled the
world for three years.

07:34.410 --> 07:35.625
But these two...

07:37.023 --> 07:38.023
What can I say?

07:38.956 --> 07:40.355
They are different.

07:43.790 --> 07:44.870
So...

07:45.000 --> 07:46.280
What do you want me to do?

07:46.380 --> 07:48.899
What is your opinion?

07:50.689 --> 07:55.810
Well, I think that $2 million is an
awful lot to spend on birthday parties.

07:56.272 --> 07:57.330
Exactly.

07:57.495 --> 07:59.010
That said...

07:59.110 --> 08:00.520
It's your call.

08:00.620 --> 08:04.106
Honestly, Nick, these aren't the
sorts of decisions that Tripp

08:04.211 --> 08:05.896
and I are accustomed to making together.

08:06.016 --> 08:07.024
This was...

08:08.227 --> 08:10.221
Well, this was always Dutch's purview.

08:11.210 --> 08:13.830
He knew when to let kids run wild.

08:14.335 --> 08:16.013
He he let life be life.

08:17.171 --> 08:19.314
That is foolishness.

08:20.367 --> 08:23.014
But, you know... do what you want.

08:24.740 --> 08:27.120
Okay. I'll take care of it.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.053
And Nicky, Nicky. We're always here.
We're always happy to help.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.210
You haven't told Nick anything,
have you?

08:40.308 --> 08:41.590
About what?

08:41.690 --> 08:43.408
About the d. N. A. Report?

08:45.060 --> 08:45.950
No.

08:47.470 --> 08:49.064
Are you planning to?

08:50.040 --> 08:52.545
I have no intention of so doing.

08:55.830 --> 08:56.883
Come in.

09:06.990 --> 09:08.292
What's the matter?

09:08.910 --> 09:10.714
I need to tell you something.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.595
Well, whatever it is, you can tell me.

09:16.310 --> 09:18.258
I don't want to go to hell.

09:19.687 --> 09:23.481
I don't think there are
very many children in hell, Gustav.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.330
Yeah, about that...

09:27.430 --> 09:30.024
My name's not Gustav.

09:32.190 --> 09:33.174
No?

09:34.090 --> 09:35.299
What is it?

09:37.340 --> 09:38.532
Brian.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.678
Brian Jr.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.008
Is my husband...

09:49.165 --> 09:51.130
Your daddy?

10:12.233 --> 10:14.260
$25 million.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.020
That's $5 million for the wedding.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.430
We'll have it on Capri.

10:17.530 --> 10:19.299
Oh, I love Capri.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.562
The blue grotto.

10:20.713 --> 10:22.767
And $5 million for the honeymoon,

10:22.887 --> 10:25.830
which will be, like, a year
of us just bumming around.

10:25.930 --> 10:29.482
We'll go surfing with Kelly in
Tahiti, follow the tour for a while.

10:29.639 --> 10:30.770
Can we go Rio?

10:32.120 --> 10:33.421
And that leaves

10:33.541 --> 10:35.329
$15 million for you...

10:36.060 --> 10:36.877
Me...

10:38.680 --> 10:40.530
And little baby-gee.

10:44.070 --> 10:47.097
So have you decided where you're
gonna have your birthday party yet?

10:47.229 --> 10:48.120
I have.

10:48.211 --> 10:50.867
And I friggin'guarantee
that if I can swing it, no one,

10:51.523 --> 10:53.300
and I mean no one...

10:53.400 --> 10:55.817
Is gonna show up to Juliet's
French farce at home.

10:59.470 --> 11:00.806
- Hey.
- What?

11:01.461 --> 11:04.209
I can't hurt the baby, can I?

11:06.677 --> 11:08.017
When we do it?

11:08.160 --> 11:09.160
Well,

11:09.719 --> 11:12.440
I mean, you are quite a man, Jeremy.

11:12.540 --> 11:14.000
You're quite formidable.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.420
But I think the baby's gonna be fine.

11:17.640 --> 11:18.980
Just, uh...

11:19.080 --> 11:21.050
Just making sure.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.493
It would just mean the world to Freddy
if he could have his bachelor party

11:24.573 --> 11:27.730
at tehnbrook like you did but
he can't unless he's a member.

11:27.909 --> 11:30.420
Karen, the tehnbrook is the most
prestigious club in the city.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.860
And we're the Darlings.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.542
Is Freddy planning on changing his
name to Darling? I hadn't heard.

11:34.635 --> 11:37.020
Pat, please just make it happen.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.930
Where has that nicolai gotten to?

11:39.030 --> 11:41.190
He is driving you today, correct?

11:41.290 --> 11:43.520
- Where is that little dickens?
- Oh, my God.

11:43.647 --> 11:46.220
You don't think Freddy's
good enough, do you?

11:46.871 --> 11:48.204
Good enough for what? Nicolai!

11:48.327 --> 11:51.531
You don't think he's good enough
to be a member of your precious club.

11:51.673 --> 11:56.170
Well, to be honest, Freddy isn't
exactly the average member.

11:56.270 --> 11:58.843
Never thought you had much of
a taste for the average member.

11:59.530 --> 12:01.460
Oh, what does that mean?

12:01.560 --> 12:03.230
Your special friend.

12:03.330 --> 12:05.314
The one with the low
voice and the eyeliner?

12:07.870 --> 12:09.222
What are
you talking about?

12:09.350 --> 12:11.094
Don't worry, pat. I would never tell.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.594
Give Ellen my best.

12:16.113 --> 12:17.331
Yeah.

12:19.530 --> 12:20.524
Hello.

12:20.651 --> 12:22.070
Is Nick available, please?

12:22.170 --> 12:23.184
He's with Jeremy.

12:23.327 --> 12:25.852
What is he doing,
planning his doofus party?

12:25.965 --> 12:27.150
Where is he having it?

12:27.250 --> 12:30.225
I really don't know. I'm sorry.
You can go in if you want.

12:30.369 --> 12:33.547
No, thank you.
I'll just wait there.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.200
Okay.

12:37.120 --> 12:40.874
Six open bars, dim sum,
steaks, a pinkberry station

12:41.009 --> 12:43.900
nats loves the stuff--
and a band and a deejay.

12:44.977 --> 12:47.420
Well, that sounds very reasonable.
I applaud your restraint.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.780
What can I say?

12:48.880 --> 12:52.337
Love changes a man. It
brings him down to earth.

12:52.900 --> 12:56.620
You must have gone through a
similar ing when you guys had Kiki.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.670
Kiki?

12:57.790 --> 12:59.870
Yeah, I'm sure you had to
re in the strippers

12:59.971 --> 13:01.474
and the blow when that little bag

13:01.587 --> 13:03.500
of baby candy was coming
in from heaven.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.690
You know, Jeremy, are you and Natalie

13:06.848 --> 13:10.109
already talking about
starting a family?

13:11.360 --> 13:14.170
We're talking about what
to name the munchkin, dude.

13:14.270 --> 13:15.990
She's pregnant?

13:19.525 --> 13:20.710
Don't you tell dad.

13:20.810 --> 13:23.170
I don't want him paying her
off like he always does.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.650
I like this one.

13:25.210 --> 13:27.270
Jeremy, are you sure you're ready?

13:27.720 --> 13:29.632
Having a kid's a huge responsibity.

13:29.745 --> 13:31.590
I know it's gonna be a lot of work.

13:31.690 --> 13:34.150
But I'm ready to--
I'm ready to change.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.478
I'm ready to be sensible.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.620
Okay.

13:40.101 --> 13:42.183
And I want to have my party
on the Brooklyn bridge.

13:45.249 --> 13:46.076
Yeah.

13:46.189 --> 13:47.203
No, seriously.

13:48.781 --> 13:50.947
It was crazy. I know that.
I'm sorry.

13:51.076 --> 13:52.320
Who's the mother?

13:52.420 --> 13:54.020
Her name is Andrea Smithson.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.340
How did you meet?

13:55.440 --> 13:57.500
She came tsee me one day for counseling.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.800
Who made the first move?

13:59.320 --> 14:01.740
- What, are you trying to punish me?
- Who made the first move?

14:03.100 --> 14:04.112
I did.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.129
And when did it end?

14:06.259 --> 14:07.260
Or has it?

14:07.360 --> 14:09.670
I stopped seeing her,
like, over three years ago.

14:09.803 --> 14:11.542
And why is your son suddenly here?

14:11.681 --> 14:13.330
Because she wants him to be a Darling.

14:13.443 --> 14:15.654
And you made the boy lie.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.540
I didn't want to hurt you.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.376
I'm sorry. I really am. I'm sorry.

14:21.940 --> 14:24.422
Please just give me
another chance. Please.

14:26.890 --> 14:29.870
You made your choices.
Now I'm making mine.

14:31.090 --> 14:32.454
I want a divorce.

14:38.164 --> 14:39.720
- The Brooklyn bridge?
- Yeah.

14:39.820 --> 14:42.715
Made some calls to the mayor's office.
I got hung up on twice.

14:42.836 --> 14:44.860
Why does Jeremy do this?

14:45.600 --> 14:46.741
Do what?

14:47.490 --> 14:49.794
Concoct impossibilities.

14:50.370 --> 14:51.530
I wish...

14:51.940 --> 14:53.983
Just once, that he would come to me

14:54.103 --> 14:55.999
and suggest something concrete,

14:56.149 --> 14:58.090
simple, small...

14:58.797 --> 15:00.053
Achievable.

15:00.970 --> 15:04.210
Well, until that day comes,
I did some asking around,

15:04.310 --> 15:08.140
and we're talking at least a million
just to close down the bridge, Tripp.

15:08.220 --> 15:10.060
Lordy zaffy.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.146
Add to that another million
for the party itself

15:12.266 --> 15:14.032
and the 1.6 Juliet's already spent

15:14.170 --> 15:16.727
it's starting to look
financially pornographic.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.860
It also doesn't bode
well for their future,

15:18.960 --> 15:22.104
given the challenges
they'll face soon as adults.

15:23.530 --> 15:25.955
You think we should
shut 'em down, huh?

15:26.090 --> 15:27.504
Actually, yeah, I do.

15:28.950 --> 15:29.938
No.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.220
Let 'em run.

15:32.780 --> 15:34.461
Why, if I may ask?

15:34.601 --> 15:37.364
I don't think they're ready
for this new life yet.

15:38.850 --> 15:41.660
What, the $25 million, the trust?

15:41.760 --> 15:44.037
Yeah, I want you to draw up a document

15:44.157 --> 15:47.349
that delays the vesting
of the trust for five years.

15:47.492 --> 15:49.293
You let them hang themselves

15:49.413 --> 15:51.920
with these birthday parties
to prove your point.

15:53.180 --> 15:54.829
What would you suggest?

15:55.490 --> 15:59.220
I'd sit down with them, talk through
their spending on these parties.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.502
I'd get them to see
how they could be more responsible,

16:01.622 --> 16:03.670
how they could spend say,

16:03.770 --> 16:06.800
you know,$500,000 and
still have a good time.

16:07.610 --> 16:08.803
I'd teach them.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.570
Won't work, Nick.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.100
It's too late.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.143
Let them have their fun tomorrow night.

16:17.136 --> 16:19.129
And then when the smoke clears

16:20.001 --> 16:24.228
they'll have time to reflect
upon their choices and...

16:26.360 --> 16:27.513
Yeah, reflect.

16:28.852 --> 16:29.875
Regret.

16:43.410 --> 16:44.869
You don't like it.

16:45.002 --> 16:46.770
Well, Lisa, it's a painting of two ants.

16:46.870 --> 16:48.867
It's more than two ants.

16:49.491 --> 16:50.903
Is the third one invisible?

16:51.027 --> 16:52.039
That's funny.

16:52.165 --> 16:54.823
The surrealists used swarms of ants to
represent consumption,

16:54.920 --> 16:57.535
and here, the artist, Robert Russell
who is very popular right now,

16:57.655 --> 16:59.922
depicts these two as individuals.

17:00.390 --> 17:02.271
They're the redemption of the species.

17:02.890 --> 17:04.769
Well, at $6,000 an ant,
they better be.

17:04.906 --> 17:06.221
You said go for it.

17:06.345 --> 17:08.449
I just didn't know this is
what you were gonna go for.

17:08.536 --> 17:10.415
You want me to take it back?
I'll take it back.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.601
No, of course not.

17:11.714 --> 17:14.089
I mean, if Juliet Darling can spend
$1 million on this birthday,

17:14.190 --> 17:15.807
you're equating me with Juliet Darling?

17:15.934 --> 17:17.839
- No, I'm not.
- You know what? That's not okay.

17:17.940 --> 17:20.663
I'm just saying it's a
lot of money for two ants.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.380
It's just infuriating.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.211
She finds these guys.
I don't know where

17:24.329 --> 17:26.569
she scrapes them off
the bottom of her shoe.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.190
That's enough talk like
that about your sister.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.400
I just wish Karen would
walk in with someone that

17:31.500 --> 17:34.439
I could learn from, someone that
I would feel lucky to get to know.

17:34.604 --> 17:38.791
I share everyone's awareness,
stated and unstated,

17:38.874 --> 17:41.874
that Karen has a tendency
to marry low,

17:41.954 --> 17:45.403
but I humbly submit that the
effort required to make a space

17:45.500 --> 17:47.720
for Freddy at the club
would be well worth it.

17:48.430 --> 17:50.270
Everyone has their foibles.

17:50.370 --> 17:53.030
I wonder if that's why she
wants to have lunch today.

17:55.689 --> 17:57.130
Excuse me.
What did you say?

17:57.230 --> 18:00.300
Well, she called yesterday, asked if
I wanted to have lunch at pastis.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.489
I hope this isn't what it's about.
That would be so uncomfortable.

18:06.650 --> 18:07.910
Pastis.

18:09.020 --> 18:12.060
So not only is he dumb enough
to fall in love with Natalie,

18:12.160 --> 18:16.020
but then he goes
and gets her pregnant.

18:16.850 --> 18:18.490
Oh, excuse me.

18:18.590 --> 18:22.025
Is that really the way they
did women's toenails in 1789?

18:22.138 --> 18:23.687
- Yes, ma'am.
- Perfect.

18:25.810 --> 18:27.817
Wait, Astrid. Slow down. I...

18:30.050 --> 18:31.050
What?

18:32.670 --> 18:33.796
Are you sure?

18:37.240 --> 18:40.542
But why would she need a
tampon if she was pregnant?

18:43.180 --> 18:45.056
What are you so afraid of?

18:45.139 --> 18:46.440
I'm not afraid of anything.

18:46.546 --> 18:48.394
I just don't want you
to hurt Ellen's feelings

18:48.492 --> 18:52.080
by sharing information that would
hurt her feelings, that's all.

18:53.730 --> 18:55.380
You sound confused.

18:55.490 --> 18:57.840
Honey, I'm just going to lunch
with my favorite sister-in-law.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.321
The idea that I would ever
want to hurt Ellen's feelings...

19:00.450 --> 19:02.310
I mean, what would that get me?

19:02.410 --> 19:04.380
Really, what?

19:04.480 --> 19:07.210
You screw up my marriage, and
you screw up my campaign.

19:07.310 --> 19:10.000
You screw up my campaign, and
you'll have dad to deal with.

19:10.100 --> 19:13.750
If you don't get Freddy into the
club, you'll have dad to deal with.

19:13.850 --> 19:15.520
As far as your campaign goes,

19:15.645 --> 19:17.533
I like New York the way it is.

19:19.210 --> 19:21.840
Okay. Karen, okay.

19:24.420 --> 19:27.159
I'm gonna try to get
Freddy into the club, okay?

19:27.610 --> 19:29.370
I can't promise anything.

19:29.980 --> 19:31.250
Can't you?

19:31.770 --> 19:33.430
Can't you promise?

19:36.560 --> 19:37.828
Guess what.

19:37.925 --> 19:40.231
- We've got the Brooklyn bridge?
- We got the Brooklyn bridge.

19:40.348 --> 19:43.023
And Simon elder's office called.
You are confirmed for dinner tonight.

19:43.175 --> 19:44.403
That's good to know.

19:44.545 --> 19:46.176
Brian Darling's here to see you.

19:46.317 --> 19:48.363
You're gonna be hearing from
Mei ling hwa's attorney.

19:48.458 --> 19:49.674
She's filing for divorce.

19:49.804 --> 19:51.849
- She found out about Brian Jr?
- Yes.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.570
How'd that happen?

19:53.670 --> 19:55.360
God's holy word.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.080
I'm sorry.

19:57.180 --> 19:59.106
I want you to be
ruthless with her lawyers.

19:59.209 --> 20:01.713
I want you to make it clear
that she is not gonna get anything

20:01.826 --> 20:04.560
more than she was promised in
the prenup, not an extra cent.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.512
I want you to make sure that they know
that I am gonna fight for the children

20:07.624 --> 20:10.440
and when, and I want you to make sure...

20:10.740 --> 20:13.889
That she knows that I
am going to crush her!

20:15.500 --> 20:17.966
Okay, note to
self-- "crush her.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.019
" I made a mess of everything.

20:27.397 --> 20:29.195
What the hell is gonna happen to me?

20:30.760 --> 20:31.950
Brian.

20:32.730 --> 20:35.760
Brian, everything is going to be okay.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.420
Every marriage has its rough edges.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.453
Oh, what do you know, Mr. perfect?

20:41.140 --> 20:42.420
Hey, Brian, do me a favor.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.880
Don't insult me when
you're asking for my help.

20:45.260 --> 20:46.770
Look, here's what're gonna do.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.079
We're gonna wait,

20:48.658 --> 20:51.700
and we're gonna see what Mei ling hwa
and her attorneys do.

20:51.800 --> 20:55.110
I want you to go over there and I want
you to ask for another chance.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.532
- She won't give me one.
- Probably not,

20:57.660 --> 21:00.670
but you obviously care too much
to just walk away

21:00.770 --> 21:03.410
and strike a bunch of angry poses.

21:05.190 --> 21:07.270
And you have children with her.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.270
I know. I miss them already.

21:10.941 --> 21:13.746
I feel like a part of me is missing.

21:14.671 --> 21:17.755
Then go over there and
ask for another chance.

21:18.540 --> 21:19.540
Okay?

21:26.568 --> 21:28.150
Yeah, okay.

21:29.920 --> 21:33.178
I'm... sorry I called you Mr. perfect.

21:34.033 --> 21:35.039
It's okay.

21:35.162 --> 21:37.913
You are kind of insufferable,
though, with your happiness.

21:42.350 --> 21:44.750
Okay, I'll go talk to her.

21:47.970 --> 21:49.190
Good luck.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.097
Hey, Juliet. What's up?

21:55.218 --> 21:56.302
We need to talk.

21:56.407 --> 21:58.312
Look, the refrigerated
trucks are gonna be there

21:58.418 --> 22:00.312
with the chocolate
aristocrats on time.

22:00.435 --> 22:02.500
This is not about the
chocolate aristocrats.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.272
It's about my brother.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.650
Jeremy, we need to talk.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.220
Nice work on the bridge, dude.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.770
Man, I knew you'd come through.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.810
See, this party is gonna be so sweet.

22:10.910 --> 22:13.519
I'm gonna have my peeps,
my baby mama.

22:13.657 --> 22:15.840
Jeremy, sit down for a second.

22:17.190 --> 22:18.206
What?

22:19.187 --> 22:20.229
No pinkberry.

22:20.343 --> 22:22.076
You gotta get her pinkberry.
She loves it.

22:22.172 --> 22:23.936
No, no, no, no. This is about Natalie.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.663
I don't think she's pregnant.

22:27.220 --> 22:29.170
What are you talking about?

22:29.730 --> 22:31.452
Has she given you any proof?

22:31.830 --> 22:33.192
I don't need proof.

22:34.130 --> 22:35.713
Where is this coming from-- Jules?

22:36.352 --> 22:37.169
Yeah.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.227
She said that

22:39.347 --> 22:44.630
Astrid said that she gave Natalie
tampons last week at twinkle.

22:44.775 --> 22:46.340
Natalie would never go to twinkle.

22:46.440 --> 22:47.886
Jeremy, are you listening to me?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.239
Natalie's using tampons.

22:50.661 --> 22:51.708
She's not pregnant.

22:51.798 --> 22:53.480
Nick, Juliet is lying.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.780
She's lying to hurt me,
to get back at nats.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.480
Jeremy, I know that Natalie and
Juliet have their differences,

22:58.564 --> 23:00.325
but I also know that
your sister loves you.

23:00.410 --> 23:02.866
- She loves herself.
- She loves you, too.

23:02.981 --> 23:05.390
And I don't think she'd make
something like this up.

23:06.100 --> 23:07.114
I don't.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.180
Just ask her to take a pregnancy test.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.280
No.

23:12.420 --> 23:15.304
No, I hate tests. I'm not gonna
test her. It's lame.

23:18.490 --> 23:19.739
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.545
I'll just...

23:23.625 --> 23:25.497
I'll just ask her to her face.

23:29.901 --> 23:31.740
And her answer will be good enough.

23:33.567 --> 23:34.649
All right.

23:47.835 --> 23:49.504
Hey, Lisa, where did the painting go?

23:49.585 --> 23:51.362
You made me feel guilty,
so I took it back.

23:51.454 --> 23:54.193
- I didn't tell you to take it back.
- Not in so many words, no.

23:54.318 --> 23:56.207
Well, go back and get it.
I want you to have it

23:56.290 --> 23:58.256
you can't make me feel bad
about buying a painting...

23:58.342 --> 24:00.839
And pretend like you wanted me
to have it. That is so controlling.

24:00.964 --> 24:02.953
I have to go have
dinner with Simon elder.

24:03.081 --> 24:04.460
- Be careful, Nick.
- I will.

24:04.580 --> 24:06.100
- Good night.
- Good night, dad.

24:07.345 --> 24:08.729
Did you really return it?

24:08.880 --> 24:11.430
Yep, and it's okay.

24:14.910 --> 24:17.942
- Happy Birthday.
- Oh, bridget, thank you.

24:19.410 --> 24:21.420
Look at these presents.

24:23.380 --> 24:25.238
- Look at these cakes.
- Oh, my God.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.359
Happy Birthday!

24:35.880 --> 24:37.234
Oh, my God.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.084
Look who's here. Ryan casdale.

24:40.204 --> 24:42.536
I personally invited him myself.

24:48.090 --> 24:49.169
Ladies.

24:50.320 --> 24:53.010
Looking particularly
lovely this evening...

24:53.680 --> 24:54.802
Your majesty.

24:56.750 --> 24:58.130
Thank you.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.790
Oh, my God.

25:01.890 --> 25:04.856
If I tell you something, do you
promise not to tell a single soul?

25:04.978 --> 25:06.330
- Sworn to secrecy.
- What?

25:06.430 --> 25:09.723
Tonight, Ryan is my gift to myself.

25:09.836 --> 25:10.990
Tonight's the night.

25:11.090 --> 25:12.471
You're gonna do it with Ryan?

25:12.582 --> 25:13.470
No!

25:13.740 --> 25:15.200
I'm gonna kiss him...

25:15.600 --> 25:18.673
Which is just as important
and equally dangerous.

25:28.010 --> 25:30.067
Sorry, excuse me. Come on.

25:32.290 --> 25:33.710
I'm not really in the mood.

25:33.810 --> 25:36.230
Oh, what's the matter, germs?

25:36.330 --> 25:37.720
You've been lame all night.

25:37.820 --> 25:39.024
Maybe I need a drink.

25:40.260 --> 25:41.930
Maybe you need two.

25:43.900 --> 25:47.537
This was all over my dad's
planner-- the letter "c"--

25:47.672 --> 25:51.313
meetings around the country,
sometimes around the world.

25:52.268 --> 25:53.960
Is that you?
Are you "c"?

25:54.419 --> 25:55.502
Yeah, that's me.

25:55.930 --> 25:58.585
So was he working for you
in any capacity-- my dad?

25:58.728 --> 26:00.130
What was going on?

26:00.230 --> 26:01.780
We were friends, Nick.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.315
We were creative conversation partners.

26:04.420 --> 26:06.571
He gave me a lot of wise
counsel-- your father.

26:06.902 --> 26:07.910
About what?

26:08.010 --> 26:11.579
About being crazy
rich, among other things.

26:12.130 --> 26:15.470
See, I was raised
in Russia with nothing.

26:15.710 --> 26:19.560
And nothing in Russia is a lot
less than nothing in America.

26:19.670 --> 26:23.790
A year after coming here to the
states, I made my first $100 million,

26:23.890 --> 26:25.710
and that nearly destroyed me.

26:26.110 --> 26:29.711
See, when starving people gorge
themselves, they usually die, yeah?

26:32.170 --> 26:33.915
I almost did.

26:34.500 --> 26:35.795
What saved you?

26:35.930 --> 26:37.730
A spiritual experience.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.451
It involved your dad, actually.

26:39.549 --> 26:41.080
Maybe I'll tell you about it sometime.

26:41.180 --> 26:44.565
But for now, no, for
now let's talk about you.

26:44.910 --> 26:48.480
I want to make this work,
with Brian Jr.

26:48.580 --> 26:50.800
And the girls and you.

26:50.900 --> 26:52.620
That's my family...

26:52.720 --> 26:54.380
Our family.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.320
For seven years, you lied to me

26:56.448 --> 26:58.470
while I shared every detail
of my life with you.

26:58.570 --> 26:59.850
I shared myself.

26:59.950 --> 27:01.236
I'm sorry.

27:01.372 --> 27:02.838
I felt trapped.

27:04.700 --> 27:06.220
I love you so much.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.810
And once I'd made the mistake,

27:07.892 --> 27:10.100
I was just too scared
to tell you the truth.

27:10.200 --> 27:11.728
I don't want to hurt you.

27:12.675 --> 27:14.593
You can resent me
and you can ignore me,

27:14.713 --> 27:17.353
you could throw things at me
if you want, but I...

27:20.160 --> 27:21.843
I just-- I want
another chance.

27:25.590 --> 27:26.671
I need one.

27:31.702 --> 27:34.913
I want you and that boy out of this
house until I figure out what to do.

27:38.650 --> 27:40.200
Thank you.

27:40.370 --> 27:42.930
It must kind of rock, having your
own party for the first time,

27:43.042 --> 27:45.600
not having to share it with
your slut-magnet brother.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.502
Yeah, it rocks.

27:48.260 --> 27:52.737
In fact, I haven't even thought of
him till you mentioned him just now.

27:58.730 --> 28:00.620
Oh, my God.

28:01.950 --> 28:03.212
That bitch.

28:06.822 --> 28:08.470
Thanks for being a friend.

28:08.550 --> 28:10.000
Happy Birthday, baby.

28:10.969 --> 28:12.030
Juliet, wait up.

28:12.169 --> 28:14.079
- What's the matter?
- Everything.

28:14.200 --> 28:18.220
Everything in the entire
little lonely lying world.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.701
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna find my brother.

28:20.826 --> 28:23.540
Come on.
Everyone is here for you.

28:23.640 --> 28:25.278
Let them eat cake.

28:33.100 --> 28:35.370
So are you pregnant or not?

28:37.600 --> 28:40.010
Just answer the question.

28:40.140 --> 28:42.170
The question doesn't even make sense.

28:42.270 --> 28:46.100
Juliet said you bummed two tampons
off Astrid last week at twinkle.

28:46.200 --> 28:48.232
Please. I would never go to twinkle.

28:49.100 --> 28:50.119
Natalie...

28:51.029 --> 28:52.900
Just tell me to my face
that you're pregnant.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.729
Come on. Look me in the eye.

29:00.970 --> 29:02.249
I thought I was.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.595
And then I wasn't, I just kept...

29:07.710 --> 29:09.380
Not telling you.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.227
I'm sorry.

29:14.950 --> 29:17.010
Just stay away from me.

29:26.765 --> 29:30.070
So all those Darling millions
you have for charity...

29:31.070 --> 29:32.460
How's that going?

29:32.560 --> 29:35.022
I haven't had the chance to
put together an infrastructure.

29:35.127 --> 29:37.270
I don't want to be the guy
who just writes the checks.

29:37.370 --> 29:39.301
I want to be involved, and...

29:40.166 --> 29:42.210
I haven't had the time
to make a start.

29:42.310 --> 29:44.570
The Darlings are
keeping you too busy, huh?

29:45.070 --> 29:46.345
That they are.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.700
Your father.

29:48.800 --> 29:52.380
The last time we talked, said that
when he looked back on his life,

29:52.480 --> 29:55.152
he realized that the world of money

29:55.272 --> 29:57.892
that the Darlings gave him access to

29:57.986 --> 30:00.587
made him lose track himself,

30:00.707 --> 30:01.888
lose track of his life.

30:02.866 --> 30:05.668
And he lost your mom
and then you

30:06.424 --> 30:07.614
in the whole bargain.

30:09.420 --> 30:10.760
He said this to you?

30:10.860 --> 30:12.150
Word for word.

30:12.250 --> 30:15.645
He hated the fact that you two
had such a ruined relationship.

30:16.530 --> 30:18.528
What did my father do for you?

30:18.667 --> 30:21.870
Tell me. I know you haven't told
me the whole truth. So just tell me.

30:22.810 --> 30:26.670
Well, all he really did, all he had
the chance to do in the end was

30:26.770 --> 30:29.357
agree with me about
the nature of privilege

30:29.477 --> 30:31.350
and the call to social responsibility.

30:31.450 --> 30:33.110
He was just about to turn the corner.

30:33.210 --> 30:35.409
He was gonna stop working
for Tripp Darling

30:35.544 --> 30:37.120
and come work for me.

30:38.493 --> 30:40.163
Then his plane fell out of the sky.

30:41.243 --> 30:43.524
You think Tripp killed my dad?

30:45.300 --> 30:48.970
I think you need to start
giving that $10 million away.

30:49.070 --> 30:52.520
And if you can't find the time to do it,
then you should come work for me.

30:52.710 --> 30:54.770
Finish what your father started.

30:55.874 --> 30:57.987
There are lots of ways
to lose your life, Nick

30:58.107 --> 31:01.350
all at ones or one day at a time.

31:09.373 --> 31:10.670
Listen up, everybody!

31:10.770 --> 31:11.970
Jeremy!

31:12.070 --> 31:14.690
Thank you all for coming tonight.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.360
Jeremy!

31:16.697 --> 31:18.580
I have something to say to everyone.

31:20.460 --> 31:23.335
Some of you came here tonight
for the free booze, right?

31:25.556 --> 31:28.943
Right some of you came
hoping that you might hook up.

31:31.563 --> 31:33.859
And maybe some of you came
'cause you actually like me.

31:33.957 --> 31:36.020
I like you. I like you.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.871
I don't know. I don't know.

31:37.984 --> 31:39.390
You see, uh...

31:40.650 --> 31:43.322
See, that's the problem with having
all this money

31:43.412 --> 31:46.107
and, uh, and spending it like this on...

31:46.900 --> 31:48.230
Jeremy!

31:48.358 --> 31:51.400
On things like this.

31:52.756 --> 31:53.580
Jeremy.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.490
You never know!

31:55.590 --> 31:57.010
No, no.

31:58.004 --> 31:59.577
All right, hit it, pillowhead.

32:04.060 --> 32:06.310
When I was young

32:07.535 --> 32:11.006
I never needed anyone

32:14.099 --> 32:16.968
and makin'love was just for fun

32:19.910 --> 32:21.999
those days are gone

32:31.070 --> 32:32.319
all by myself

32:36.913 --> 32:39.160
don't wanna be

32:39.332 --> 32:41.081
all by myself anymore

32:45.570 --> 32:48.461
oh, here come the peace officers.

32:56.040 --> 32:59.277
Well, I had them dust, and,
well, change the sheets,

32:59.390 --> 33:03.330
but other than that, it's
exactly the way you left it.

33:03.430 --> 33:05.180
Who was the second bunk for?

33:05.280 --> 33:07.810
Oh, that was so your father
could have friends sleep over.

33:07.910 --> 33:09.216
That really worked out.

33:09.348 --> 33:11.493
You know, there are other
rooms that you could stay in.

33:11.587 --> 33:13.206
Why don't we open up
the sixth floor?

33:13.319 --> 33:15.130
No. If Mei ling hwa
ever comes to visit,

33:15.230 --> 33:18.540
she'll want to make sure I've really
suffered, and this'll do just fine.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.753
You know, it's an odd feeling,

33:20.870 --> 33:24.518
having all the children back in
the building, under the same roof.

33:24.622 --> 33:27.100
We're a regular "little house.

33:27.210 --> 33:29.788
" In a way, it's as if we're all...

33:31.060 --> 33:33.260
Getting another chance.

33:34.590 --> 33:36.342
It's like backgammon, Brian.

33:36.472 --> 33:40.129
You live your entire life,
and then when you least expect it,

33:40.227 --> 33:42.921
you're suddenly thrown all
the way back to the beginning.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.650
But that's not the end of the game.

33:48.780 --> 33:51.770
I'm very happy you're here, pumpkin.

33:51.870 --> 33:54.941
See you both in the
morning for breakfast.

33:55.063 --> 33:56.079
Okay.

34:08.270 --> 34:09.969
Sorry I got you in trouble.

34:11.159 --> 34:13.060
You didn't get me in trouble.

34:13.159 --> 34:14.800
You did the right thing.

34:16.077 --> 34:17.272
Nice room.

34:18.480 --> 34:19.790
Thanks.

34:22.710 --> 34:25.061
We sent you to the finest schools.

34:25.186 --> 34:26.614
Provided you with

34:26.735 --> 34:29.884
every conceivable advantage,
and this is how you thank us,

34:30.014 --> 34:35.429
with a $2-million
Brooklyn bridge bacchanal,

34:35.530 --> 34:38.260
where you, the host,
the guest of honor

34:38.770 --> 34:41.654
the birthday boy had to be
forcibly removed by the police.

34:41.786 --> 34:43.818
I screwed up. It's what I do.

34:43.949 --> 34:48.166
I had to get Nick out of a business
dinner to deal with this nonsense.

34:48.299 --> 34:50.202
I was just finishing up, actually.

34:50.341 --> 34:52.108
Well, that's not the point.

34:52.257 --> 34:57.464
He has done nothing with his life since
he left college except disappoint me.

34:58.086 --> 35:00.928
I know. I'm the worst thing that's
ever happened to you, dad. I know.

35:01.060 --> 35:02.736
Instead of choosing to learn

35:02.830 --> 35:06.886
instead of working hard at
a job to achieve something,

35:07.633 --> 35:09.606
all you've done is seek out

35:09.729 --> 35:12.040
celebrities to what,

35:12.140 --> 35:15.812
to borrow an ounce
or two of their glory?

35:17.080 --> 35:19.880
"Justin Timberlake"?

35:19.980 --> 35:22.330
"Ethan hawke"?

35:22.430 --> 35:24.206
Who are these people?

35:24.338 --> 35:26.050
All right, you know,
are we done here?

35:26.150 --> 35:28.400
Because, your loser son,
he's feeling a little tired.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.260
He'd like to get some rest.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.990
Oh, far be it from me to
waste your precious time.

35:35.090 --> 35:39.250
You know, we should not just
delay the payout of that trust.

35:39.350 --> 35:41.008
We should terminate the damn thing.

35:41.116 --> 35:42.359
You're delaying my trust?

35:42.532 --> 35:44.857
No, I'm revoking it entirely.

35:44.980 --> 35:47.135
- Let's not be hasty.
- You know what? I don't care.

35:47.276 --> 35:50.020
You go ahead. You go ahead and
you postpone it. You give it away.

35:50.144 --> 35:52.947
I don't friggin'care as long as
I get out from under you.

35:53.051 --> 35:54.930
I wish that I could be
someone you loved, dad.

35:55.030 --> 35:56.721
I wish that, but I can't.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.580
I can't. I can just be me.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.830
Know that's not good enough for you.

36:07.431 --> 36:08.438
I'm sorry.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.433
I suppose you think this is my fault.

36:13.553 --> 36:16.110
That if I had just
sat down with him...

36:16.241 --> 36:18.838
I am a bit puzzled,
I have to admit,

36:18.952 --> 36:21.106
how you can yell at him
for being irresponsible

36:21.257 --> 36:23.135
when you refuse to be
responsible with him.

36:23.270 --> 36:25.679
This is between Jeremy and me.

36:27.610 --> 36:28.886
No, it's not.

36:29.616 --> 36:31.476
Because I'm here to
tell you what's wrong.

36:32.521 --> 36:34.309
It's wrong what you're
doing to him, Tripp.

36:34.439 --> 36:37.344
You're trying to scare him
into being who you want him to be.

36:38.660 --> 36:41.790
Is that what money for,
to scare people,

36:41.910 --> 36:44.780
to control people
you're losing Jeremy, Tripp.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.790
You're losing him one day at a time.

36:47.330 --> 36:50.035
You could wake up one
morning and find him gone.

36:52.320 --> 36:53.870
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:03.128 --> 37:06.049
You and Natalie together was like
drinking orange juice

37:06.169 --> 37:08.150
after brushing your teeth.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.382
Yeah, and she's the orange juice.

37:10.512 --> 37:13.311
Can you imagine her mothering a child?

37:13.431 --> 37:15.636
What an unbearable thought.

37:18.290 --> 37:20.125
What should I do about dad?

37:22.850 --> 37:24.619
You should just apologize.

37:24.699 --> 37:25.870
He'll understand.

37:25.970 --> 37:29.120
That's easy for you to say.
He's giving you your $25 million.

37:29.370 --> 37:30.670
No, he's not.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.812
I told him I could wait five years.

37:32.962 --> 37:37.536
I threw a party for $1 million last
night, and I had the worst time ever.

37:38.380 --> 37:40.240
I can wait.

37:42.081 --> 37:45.206
You ever think things would be better
if we weren't so incredibly loaded?

37:45.328 --> 37:47.116
You mean you wish we were poor?

37:47.257 --> 37:51.150
Not starving with flies on our faces,
just a little more normal.

37:51.870 --> 37:55.595
Well, I think you can be as
normal as you want to be.

37:56.690 --> 37:59.237
But I think you're pretty spectacular.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.832
And you're gonna do spectacular things.

38:14.870 --> 38:16.112
What time is it?

38:17.010 --> 38:18.042
It's 9:00.

38:18.570 --> 38:20.130
I let you sleep in.

38:20.540 --> 38:23.580
I got up early, made Kiki some
breakfast, then I went to a gallery.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.872
What gallery's open this early?

38:26.023 --> 38:28.329
I made some special arrangements.
I know the Darlings.

38:28.451 --> 38:31.961
Yeah, them. I remember.

38:33.749 --> 38:35.857
I wanted to surprise you
and get your painting back,

38:35.989 --> 38:38.050
but somebody else bought it already.

38:38.980 --> 38:42.595
And I want to apologize for
being controlling and superior--

38:42.726 --> 38:45.907
juvenile, obnoxious, a jackass?

38:46.020 --> 38:47.507
I think the word is cheap.

38:48.910 --> 38:51.196
I realized last night during
my dinner with Simon elder

38:51.319 --> 38:54.020
that I'm the one I'm mad at about
spending the money, not you.

38:54.850 --> 38:57.206
I told you, I told myself
when I started this job

38:57.322 --> 38:59.949
that I took it to help people,
and I haven't done that.

39:00.070 --> 39:03.449
There are hungry people,
sick people right here in this city,

39:04.278 --> 39:05.512
I'm just frustrated.

39:05.603 --> 39:07.681
There's stuff to be done
in the real, troubled world,

39:07.801 --> 39:10.045
and I'm out organizing
birthday parties

39:10.165 --> 39:12.930
and photo shoots
and all sorts of crazy...

39:14.870 --> 39:16.970
I'm the one I'm mad at, not you.

39:17.380 --> 39:19.590
That's what I came here to say.

39:21.442 --> 39:23.031
Apology accepted.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.935
All right, rise and shine.
I got something to show you.

39:30.070 --> 39:31.250
How much were they?

39:31.350 --> 39:33.615
Oh, who cares? You liked 'em,
and I love you.

39:33.730 --> 39:35.440
Oh, I love you, too.

39:37.370 --> 39:38.428
Thank you.

39:43.709 --> 39:45.257
That is Swedish,

39:45.377 --> 39:47.516
for you speak English.

39:48.580 --> 39:51.340
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

39:51.874 --> 39:53.674
Don't worry. He won't eat you.

39:53.804 --> 39:56.540
Hey, how about a smile, little guy?

39:57.465 --> 39:59.410
Come on. You can smile.

39:59.510 --> 40:02.515
You're the luckiest orphan
in the world, you know?

40:02.639 --> 40:03.510
What?

40:03.618 --> 40:07.426
Oh, is orphan not p. C. Anymore?
What should I say instead?

40:07.980 --> 40:09.520
He's not an orphan.

40:11.340 --> 40:13.909
Your brother Brian is his father.

40:15.387 --> 40:16.780
Really?

40:17.310 --> 40:18.790
Sorry.

40:20.890 --> 40:24.240
Freddy, remember, these men
aren't gods. They're just men.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.661
That being said, make me proud.

40:27.750 --> 40:29.020
Right over here.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.584
Well, look who it is.
The estimable candidate.

40:33.690 --> 40:36.105
Gentlemen, my future brother-in-law
Freddy Mason.

40:36.185 --> 40:37.950
Freddy Mason, holy cow.

40:38.050 --> 40:41.920
I was at firestone in 2005 when you
holed that chip shot on the 18th.

40:42.020 --> 40:43.460
Your short game's a vision.

40:43.560 --> 40:44.850
Well, thank you very much.

40:44.950 --> 40:47.040
You should put this titan
up for membership, paddy.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.450
I plan to do just that.

40:54.330 --> 40:56.886
I just wanted to say I'm sorry for...

40:58.370 --> 41:01.180
Saying those things
last night, and, um...

41:02.440 --> 41:05.251
For getting a little o. O. C.

41:05.371 --> 41:06.861
O. O. C.?

41:08.440 --> 41:09.670
Out of control.

41:09.806 --> 41:10.859
Yeah, well...

41:12.300 --> 41:14.180
I don't want you to
think I'm here apologizing'

41:14.280 --> 41:16.710
cause I want the trust
back,'cause I don't.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.781
So what is it you want, a rocket?

41:20.375 --> 41:22.175
The hubble telescope?

41:23.890 --> 41:25.550
I want a job.

41:27.610 --> 41:28.628
A job?

41:30.744 --> 41:32.890
I been thinking lately, and...

41:34.430 --> 41:36.420
I should get a job, right?

41:36.520 --> 41:37.611
Young man...

41:39.350 --> 41:41.360
You have just made me...

41:43.030 --> 41:44.658
Truly proud.

41:46.580 --> 41:48.560
So how can this money help you?

41:48.660 --> 41:52.750
Well, it cost $9,000
to install a playground

41:52.850 --> 41:54.687
so that kids have somewhere to go.

41:54.792 --> 41:56.839
And we did a study of
inner-city schools that shows

41:56.952 --> 42:00.960
these playgrounds cut down
kids' e. R. Visits by 65%.

42:01.050 --> 42:03.850
Now we understand how many
people must apply to your fund...

42:03.950 --> 42:06.200
But because of the work
you've done in the past,

42:06.300 --> 42:08.490
we thought that--
here you go.

42:13.071 --> 42:14.351
$200,000?

42:16.590 --> 42:18.570
We were afraid to ask for $20,000.

42:18.670 --> 42:22.120
Excuse me, Nick, Tripp
Darling for you on line one.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.440
Tell him I'll call him back.

42:26.640 --> 42:27.770
What?

42:28.840 --> 42:30.679
I said I'll call him back.

42:34.801 --> 42:35.949
Thank you so much.

42:36.081 --> 42:38.430
You have no idea
how much this money

42:38.550 --> 42:40.890
can change our organization.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.230
Actually, I do.

42:44.018 --> 42:45.779
But I'm giving it to you anyway.
