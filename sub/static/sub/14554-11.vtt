WEBVTT

00:05.139 --> 00:06.640
So how are the--
How are the kids ?

00:06.674 --> 00:08.142
They're good.

00:08.176 --> 00:10.211
Jane gave me a really
hard time this morning,

00:10.244 --> 00:12.680
but I got 'em off
to school, so.

00:15.349 --> 00:18.119
Okay, so I have a--

00:18.152 --> 00:21.555
I maybe have something
that I have to--

00:21.589 --> 00:23.191
Well, I got something I
gotta tell you about that's--

00:23.224 --> 00:24.525
maybe I have.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.127
Okay.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.361
Here's the thing.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.398
Okay, I was on-- I did "The
Tonight Show" the other night.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.500
I don't know if you saw it.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.203
It went really well.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.106
And so I had
a meeting at--

00:38.139 --> 00:39.340
I had a meeting at CBS.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.209
CBS?

00:41.242 --> 00:43.277
Yeah, with like, the chairman
of CBS, like in the--

00:46.247 --> 00:47.515
Anyway, he told--

00:47.548 --> 00:49.217
The thing is, though,
he told me--

00:49.250 --> 00:51.119
He made me sign
a confidentiality agreement

00:51.152 --> 00:54.355
saying I would never repeat this
to anybody, just so you know.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.690
So maybe you shouldn't
tell me.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.192
No, I have to tell you
so I can tell you

00:58.226 --> 00:59.760
what's going on with me.
Okay.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.731
All right, look--

01:03.764 --> 01:06.534
David-- David Letterman
is retiring

01:06.567 --> 01:11.139
at the end of
next year and they're--

01:11.172 --> 01:14.275
I guess they're looking
at possibly--

01:14.308 --> 01:17.378
at maybe me
to maybe be the guy

01:17.411 --> 01:20.248
who could replace him.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.216
Take over Letterman's job?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.185
Yeah.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.419
But so--

01:25.453 --> 01:27.221
Wait, you're just like,
on a list or something?

01:27.255 --> 01:28.289
Is that what you're
telling me?

01:28.322 --> 01:29.657
Well, no,
apparently, it's--

01:29.690 --> 01:32.260
Like, it's between me
and Jerry Seinfeld,

01:32.293 --> 01:34.462
and obviously, he's
the frontrunner, but I--

01:34.495 --> 01:36.564
They're looking at me,
like, as an option.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.266
Because you'd be cheaper.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.367
Yeah.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.270
And so I'm supposed to start
working with this guy

01:42.303 --> 01:44.272
here in New York,
like, this producer guy,

01:44.305 --> 01:48.276
to like, train, and I'm supposed
to do a test show and--

01:48.309 --> 01:49.443
I guess if they
like the show--

01:49.477 --> 01:51.279
You know, it's
a really outside shot.

01:51.312 --> 01:55.216
It's a way outside shot,
but I have...

01:55.249 --> 01:57.518
a shot.

01:57.551 --> 02:00.454
And well, I'm telling
you this because I--

02:00.488 --> 02:03.591
Of course, I can't--
You know, I can't do it.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.793
What? Why?

02:05.826 --> 02:08.296
Because I got the kids
three days a week

02:08.329 --> 02:10.298
and if I had
a full-time job--

02:10.331 --> 02:11.599
This is more than
a full-time job.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.700
It's just--

02:12.733 --> 02:15.303
Ah, forget the kids.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.538
What?
The kids.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.307
I got the kids.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.774
You go do this,
you go get this job.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.843
You go get this job.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.614
I don't even know if I can.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.316
Well, you can
if you want it.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.618
You have to get this,
Louie.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.321
Janet, I'm--
Jerry Seinfeld is--

02:33.354 --> 02:35.356
Oh, Jerry Seinfeld, boo.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.724
He's not even that good.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.460
I mean, not like that.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.628
His show was great,

02:40.661 --> 02:44.332
but that was
a long time ago, okay?

02:44.365 --> 02:45.733
No, you have more
than a shot.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.401
These people
aren't idiots.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.637
They picked you
for a reason.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.805
Janet, you're not--

02:51.839 --> 02:53.574
Look, I've been on the road
doing comedy,

02:53.607 --> 02:55.309
standup for
all these years

02:55.343 --> 02:59.347
because I can do that and then--
I make my own schedule

02:59.380 --> 03:01.315
and then I'm able to take
my time with the kids

03:01.349 --> 03:02.550
so they're with
me half the time,

03:02.583 --> 03:04.318
they're used to that,
they need that.

03:04.352 --> 03:07.288
Louie, you'll see them on
the weekends,

03:07.321 --> 03:08.522
you'll have them
over the summer.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.224
Yes, you'll see them
a lot less,

03:10.258 --> 03:13.861
but that's because
you'll have a job.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.665
I have a job.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.899
( chuckles )

03:23.637 --> 03:25.673
Louie.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.441
You came here so
that I would tell you

03:27.475 --> 03:29.843
that you can't do this,
didn't you?

03:29.877 --> 03:32.413
Because I need you to do
your share with the kids?

03:32.446 --> 03:34.715
That's why you're here?

03:34.748 --> 03:37.618
You don't have the gall
to take this thing on

03:37.651 --> 03:39.887
and you want me
to blame?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.855
Here's the bad news, buddy.

03:41.889 --> 03:45.393
You can totally get this show
and the girls will be fine.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.561
I mean, this standup thing,
where's that going?

03:47.595 --> 03:48.762
Huh?

03:48.796 --> 03:51.399
It was going to this.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.435
If you don't do this, I mean,
what was it all for?

03:54.468 --> 03:57.371
What did you put
20 years into this for?

03:57.405 --> 04:01.275
What did I put my nine
in for?

04:04.745 --> 04:07.415
Listen, you've been
a fine father,

04:07.448 --> 04:08.882
but nobody needs
a father that much.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.818
The girls need
a role model.

04:10.851 --> 04:13.587
They need to see you
live and succeed.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.828
Look, I'm not
bitter about anything.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.631
You've--
I'm grateful to you.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.667
You supported us for years,
you supported me.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.670
And since I've got my
degree, I haven't needed you.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.474
I'm not asking you
for anything.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.842
I'm just--

04:37.878 --> 04:40.781
I hate to see what
the future will be

04:40.814 --> 04:42.716
if you don't make this
happen.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.818
Hi, I'm--

05:50.851 --> 05:53.521
I'm here to see
Jack Dahl.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.556
It's "Dahl."

05:55.589 --> 05:57.525
Dahl-- Dahl?

05:57.558 --> 05:58.926
It's "Dahl."

06:01.729 --> 06:03.564
Okay.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.433
Thank you.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.838
( beep )

06:10.871 --> 06:12.673
Yes?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.875
Oh, yes.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.445
You can go in now.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.579
Thank you.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.615
He's waiting.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.866
Mr. Dahl.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.435
Dahl?

06:41.469 --> 06:43.604
My name's Louie C.K.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.473
I was sent here--

06:45.506 --> 06:46.940
Sent here?

06:46.974 --> 06:49.710
What are you, a letter?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.779
Nobody sent you.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.814
Well, I--

06:53.847 --> 06:55.616
He told me that
I should contact you

06:55.649 --> 06:57.751
about the "Late Show"
thing?

06:57.785 --> 06:59.052
That I-- He said--

06:59.086 --> 07:00.721
Well, I have a test show in,
like, two months

07:00.754 --> 07:02.990
and you were gonna--
Pick up
one of those cards.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.625
Excuse me?

07:04.658 --> 07:06.660
I said pick up
one of those cards.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.128
These cards?
Yes.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.901
You stand there.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.603
And you stand there.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.872
Hold up the card.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.647
Uh--
Read the card!

07:26.680 --> 07:27.815
Okay.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.685
"President Nixon today--"

07:31.719 --> 07:33.521
Uh, Nixon?

07:38.659 --> 07:40.093
"President Nixon
today announced

07:40.127 --> 07:42.630
"that he's going
to recognize China,

07:42.663 --> 07:43.931
"but that if
he's not careful,

07:43.964 --> 07:46.066
he might mistake them
for Korea."

07:55.709 --> 07:57.110
What--

07:57.144 --> 07:59.547
You forgot to say,
"We'll be right back."

07:59.580 --> 08:00.981
Oh, right.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.720
"We'll be right back."

08:18.999 --> 08:22.670
Took you one minute
and 12 seconds

08:22.703 --> 08:24.037
to tell one joke.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.673
It's too long.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.674
Oh.

08:26.707 --> 08:27.975
No, I didn't--
I didn't--

08:28.008 --> 08:30.210
Comedy is about timing
son.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.582
Timing.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.950
You gotta get 'em,
you gotta tell 'em.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.159
Okay--
Work on your speed.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.695
Come back on Wednesday.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.134
Uh.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.209
Leave the card here.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.764
Oh, man.

09:23.797 --> 09:24.932
Hey!

09:24.965 --> 09:26.066
She's stealing!

09:26.099 --> 09:27.735
No, no, no,
don't do that, Jane.

09:27.768 --> 09:28.936
Don't do that.
Daddy, she stole!

09:28.969 --> 09:30.804
Baby, come here, come here.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.906
Officer, that lady stole!

09:32.940 --> 09:34.975
I don't know what
she's talking about.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.079
I did good, didn't I?

09:44.785 --> 09:45.485
All right, girls.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.621
Get ready for bed,
all right?

09:47.655 --> 09:48.822
Okay.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.190
( phone ringing )

09:51.191 --> 09:52.259
Hello?

09:52.292 --> 09:53.894
Louie C.K.?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.796
Hi.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.097
Hey, it's me, Jay Leno.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.132
Yeah, hi Jay,
how you doing?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.734
Hey listen, I want to thank
you for last week, man.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.235
You really bailed us out.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.071
You were really terrific,
I really appreciate it.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.707
Oh, that's really nice,
Jay, thank you.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.809
Hey, I heard something
through the grapevine.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.244
You're up for
Dave's job, huh?

10:11.278 --> 10:13.180
Oh.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.748
Yeah, I know you're not
supposed to tell,

10:14.782 --> 10:16.249
but you know,
I know everything.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.118
Okay.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.787
So this is a big deal, huh?

10:19.820 --> 10:23.791
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.293
Listen, while I have you
on the phone,

10:26.326 --> 10:28.996
can I ask you something?
Yeah sure, go ahead.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.832
Well, should I take
the job?

10:31.865 --> 10:33.300
I mean, if I get it?

10:33.333 --> 10:35.936
You really want to know?
Yeah.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.270
Uh, don't do it.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.272
Really?

10:39.306 --> 10:43.777
Well, you know how you're the
hip guy, you're the cool guy?

10:43.811 --> 10:45.813
That used to be me.

10:45.846 --> 10:49.282
But then you gotta do
14 minutes every single night.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.319
Nobody is hip every
single night.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.987
I wish somebody
had told me that.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.124
Wow.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.992
Okay.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.728
I hope you get it
and if you get it,

11:00.761 --> 11:02.662
it's the last time we'll
talk as friends.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.299
Well, thanks, Jay.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.334
Okay.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.836
Good luck, bye-bye.

11:10.838 --> 11:15.308
Jay Leno is a liar, okay?

11:15.342 --> 11:17.811
He loves that job.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.313
It's his whole life.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.883
He's just trying
to get rid of you.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.251
Oh.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.219
Yeah, "oh."

11:26.253 --> 11:28.155
You gotta get your
head up, man.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.923
It's the late-night wars.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.091
Wars.

11:31.124 --> 11:34.027
Everybody's out to get you.

11:34.061 --> 11:37.064
You gotta smarten up.

11:37.097 --> 11:40.233
And don't listen
to nobody.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.269
And nobody meaning
Jay Leno in particular.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.837
Right.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.238
Right.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.706
Shit.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.845
You might have
something here, Louie.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.915
Don't [bleep] it up.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.087
I gotta go see the guy.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.357
Thanks, man.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.059
Watch your back.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.067
Yeah.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.904
Did you know Letterman
was retiring?

12:16.937 --> 12:18.305
Well, how the--

12:18.338 --> 12:20.140
How do I know
and you don't know?

12:25.946 --> 12:27.347
( Jack )
Start.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.384
What?

12:31.418 --> 12:33.020
Start.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.323
Start what?

12:36.356 --> 12:39.159
Hosting "Late Show
with Louie C.K."

12:39.192 --> 12:40.227
Go!

12:40.260 --> 12:41.895
Oh.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.096
All right.

12:44.431 --> 12:47.467
Hey, all right,
let's get started.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.238
I'm Louie C.K.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.306
You don't need to tell 'em
your name, son.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.976
The announcer does that.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.445
Well, I don't know where
you want me to start.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.116
Hello?

13:05.318 --> 13:06.954
I'm coming in.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.266
Look, I-- I don't know.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.268
I guess I just don't know
exactly what you--

13:21.301 --> 13:22.836
What you want me to--

13:25.038 --> 13:27.975
You come out, you say hello,
you start the show,

13:28.008 --> 13:29.009
here's the show.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.210
What's the mystery?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.281
Move aside.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.083
Go watch on the TV.

13:40.353 --> 13:43.823
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jack Dahl!

13:50.363 --> 13:51.999
Good evening.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.503
( cheers and applause )

14:03.276 --> 14:05.278
( cheers and applause )

14:16.356 --> 14:18.091
( cheers and applause )

14:27.000 --> 14:29.036
Good evening.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.438
This is "Late Show."

14:39.312 --> 14:41.048
Can you do it?

14:42.983 --> 14:45.385
I don't--
I don't think so.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.519
Skip it.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.355
Let's get to the jokes.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.358
Have you been working
on your speed?
Yeah, yeah.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.293
Okay, stand right there.
All right.

14:54.962 --> 14:55.996
Read.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.101
"Today President Reagan--"

15:01.134 --> 15:02.035
Reagan?

15:02.069 --> 15:03.570
Can I have some
today jokes?

15:03.603 --> 15:05.138
You're not ready.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.377
"Today President Reagan said
that Russia is an evil empire

15:10.410 --> 15:13.080
and that Margaret Thatcher
is an ugly cuss."

15:16.083 --> 15:18.418
We'll be right back.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.520
Not bad, not bad.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.291
Okay, relax.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.293
Let's talk about this.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.961
Talk about what?

15:27.995 --> 15:31.098
Body, face, beard, hair,

15:31.131 --> 15:33.433
clothes, you.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.601
Let's talk about it.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.971
Okay, look--
I'd rather not.

15:38.005 --> 15:40.173
Listen, crackerjack,
if you're gonna be televised,

15:40.207 --> 15:42.309
you gotta be easy
on the eyes.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.112
It's no good if people
hate looking at you....

15:45.145 --> 15:47.480
You need a suit, a tie...

15:47.514 --> 15:50.117
and some Brylcreem.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.585
Listen, Jack, I gotta say
something right now, I think.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.187
Okay.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.189
All right, I-- I am not
gonna wear a suit, okay?

15:56.223 --> 15:59.326
And I get that late-night show
hosts have always worn them.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.461
Jack Parr, Steve Allen,

16:01.494 --> 16:03.030
Carson, Letterman,

16:03.063 --> 16:04.631
not a T-shirt in the bunch.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.333
Just 'cause you like laying
around your house

16:06.366 --> 16:08.101
in your underpants
doesn't mean

16:08.135 --> 16:10.170
the United States
of America has to see it.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.504
I'm not--
You put on a suit, brother.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.606
I'm not wearing a suit.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.108
I'm sorry,
I'm not doing it.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.509
I've been this guy
for 25 years,

16:16.543 --> 16:18.611
I'm not gonna
become a different person.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.148
I'm doing the best I can
at adapting here

16:21.181 --> 16:23.550
and I know I have to do
new things, but I don't--

16:23.583 --> 16:28.155
I feel like I've given this
a lot of thought and I've--

16:31.558 --> 16:37.030
Go see a man named Alphonse
at this address,

16:37.064 --> 16:41.201
tomorrow morning,
9:00 sharp.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.502
Are we done?

16:42.535 --> 16:44.404
Dear God, I hope so.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.088
( man )
Keep your hands up,
keep your hands up.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.458
Do you know Alphonse?
Do you know where Alphonse--

17:38.491 --> 17:40.227
There you go.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.462
Is he that guy
on the left?

17:42.495 --> 17:45.332
Keep your hands up, both your
hands, both your hands.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.113
There you go.

18:00.147 --> 18:03.150
Hi, are you Alphonse?
Yeah.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.285
My name's Louie,
I was sent here to--

18:05.318 --> 18:06.619
Yeah, Jack wanted me
to get you ready.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.488
Yeah, um.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.257
Come on, fight your way out,
fight your way out.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.159
Get out that corner,
get out the corner!

18:12.192 --> 18:13.793
Fight your way out!
There you go.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.300
Go on in the back,
get yourself--

18:20.333 --> 18:22.269
Get yourself ready.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.237
I didn't know
I was working out.

18:24.271 --> 18:27.240
I don't have shorts
or anything.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.276
Shorty.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.178
Take him to the back, get him
some shorts and gloves.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.353
Get on up in here.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.595
( beeping )

18:48.628 --> 18:50.297
What do I do?

18:50.330 --> 18:51.564
You're gonna fight him.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.702
You're gonna fight him.

19:16.389 --> 19:19.359
( laughter )

19:19.392 --> 19:22.262
Oh shit!

19:22.295 --> 19:23.730
Wow...

19:23.763 --> 19:25.532
Okay, come back tomorrow.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.811
( announcer on TV )
Extra!

19:38.845 --> 19:41.348
Speculation that David
Letterman is retiring

19:41.381 --> 19:43.416
at the end of this year
and who will replace him

19:43.450 --> 19:45.385
has just gotten more
interesting.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.420
In addition to Jerry Seinfeld,

19:47.454 --> 19:49.589
who is widely regarded as
the frontrunner for the job,

19:49.622 --> 19:53.526
comedian Chris Rock has emerged
as a strong possibility.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.528
Chris Rock has denied being
considered,

19:55.562 --> 19:58.398
but inside sources
say he has lobbied hard

19:58.431 --> 20:00.367
to beat Jerry Seinfeld
for the job.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.378
It's Dahl.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.546
Dahl?

20:13.580 --> 20:15.415
It's "Dahl."

20:15.448 --> 20:17.417
Dahl?

20:17.450 --> 20:18.418
"Dahl."

20:18.451 --> 20:19.886
Dahl?

20:19.919 --> 20:21.721
"Dahl."

20:21.754 --> 20:22.855
Dahl.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.391
"Dahl."

20:24.424 --> 20:25.392
Dahl.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.393
"Dahl."

20:26.426 --> 20:29.429
Dahl.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.398
"Dahl."

20:31.431 --> 20:33.400
Dahl?

20:33.433 --> 20:35.368
It's "Dahl."

20:35.402 --> 20:37.404
"Dahl."

20:37.437 --> 20:38.505
"Dahl."

20:40.640 --> 20:43.743
Oh, okay.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.412
Thank you.
