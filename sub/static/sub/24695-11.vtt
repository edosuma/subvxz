In new york
city's war on crime,

00:02.863 --> 00:04.464
the worst criminal offenders

00:04.531 --> 00:08.034
are pursued by the detectives
of the major case squad.

00:08.102 --> 00:10.236
These are their stories.

00:11.506 --> 00:16.177
- That man cannot tolerate
a meaningless existence

00:16.178 --> 00:19.547
Was central
to jung's understanding.

00:19.548 --> 00:23.551
But how does this relate
to jung's shadow theory, hmm?

00:25.887 --> 00:27.488
Sarah?

00:27.489 --> 00:30.257
[snapping fingers]
welcome back.

00:30.258 --> 00:33.327
Jung's shadow theory.

00:33.328 --> 00:36.263
- We all have a shadow side.

00:36.264 --> 00:39.867
And jung felt the less it's
embodied in our conscious life,

00:39.868 --> 00:43.471
The more dangerous it is.

00:43.472 --> 00:45.906
- Yes, that--
that's well said.

00:45.907 --> 00:50.578
[cell phone rings]
- hi, sis.

00:50.579 --> 00:53.381
I always know when it's you
with a dose of personal concern.

00:55.851 --> 01:08.963
Where I was all night?
What does it matter?

01:08.964 --> 01:12.633
Because that's all he needs
to know.

01:17.439 --> 01:20.174
- You look really cool.

01:20.175 --> 01:24.045
- Cool?
What are we, in high school?

01:24.046 --> 01:25.846
I'm your mistress
of the night.

01:25.847 --> 01:29.450
- And we are seekers
of a greater truth.

01:29.451 --> 01:31.719
Let's go.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.954

âª âª

01:44.866 --> 01:48.769
- Hey, hang here.
I'm gonna push for the bar.

01:54.776 --> 01:57.978
- I could make you
my next meal.

01:57.979 --> 02:00.047
- What would I taste like?

02:00.048 --> 02:04.652
- First bite,
like a dark-chocolate truffle.

02:04.653 --> 02:07.588
You take
- w more than a bite?Like?

02:07.589 --> 02:09.323
- Like a lamb...

02:09.324 --> 02:13.060
Flayed of its skin,
bleating...

02:13.061 --> 02:15.696
But quivering
and wanting more.

02:15.697 --> 02:17.631
- Hey.
I'm kyle...

02:17.632 --> 02:19.767
The boyfriend.

02:21.036 --> 02:24.705
- Oh, kyle. This is--
- a dark encounter.

02:24.706 --> 02:28.342
- I'm afraid
you've lost her, old boy.

02:28.343 --> 02:30.111
My deepest sympathies.

02:30.112 --> 02:32.780
- Why don't you get acquainted
with him while I...

02:32.781 --> 02:35.182
Screen this little lamb?

02:36.918 --> 02:40.387
- Now let's ease your pain.

02:45.160 --> 02:49.864
- A strange
and beautiful creature

02:49.865 --> 02:53.300
Desires you
with aching hunger.

03:37.779 --> 03:41.182
- You like him?
- Kyle, you're--

03:41.183 --> 03:42.550
Kyle, you're hurting me.

03:42.551 --> 03:45.719
- You like rough?
I can give you rough.

03:50.692 --> 03:53.327
- She hasn't called back.
She hasn't picked up her phone.

03:53.328 --> 03:56.764
Our father is very concerned.

 Lost Children of The Blood

04:52.967 --> 04:54.801
- I was thinking of keira.

04:54.802 --> 04:57.671
In ten years, I'll be sending
her off to college.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.973
- Right. They go off.
They go off.

04:59.974 --> 05:02.109
You know, they tell you
they're sexually ambivalent

05:02.110 --> 05:03.443
Or want to be ecoterrorists.

05:03.444 --> 05:06.547
But with any luck,
you know,

05:06.548 --> 05:09.082
You're not gonna
get this, right?

05:09.083 --> 05:12.119
- Well, it's hard to tell much.
There's so much blood.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.787
Possibly vaginal penetration

05:13.788 --> 05:15.455
And a slight bruising
on the neck,

05:15.456 --> 05:17.591
But not enough
to suggest strangulation.

05:17.592 --> 05:19.126
- Maybe erotic asphyxiation?

05:19.127 --> 05:21.061
- I'm thinking maybe a rupture
of the varices

05:21.062 --> 05:22.729
In her esophagus.

05:22.730 --> 05:25.465
She vomited blood,
maybe choked on it,

05:25.466 --> 05:26.767
Or simply bled out.

05:26.768 --> 05:30.470
- Exsanguination--
extreme loss of blood.

05:30.471 --> 05:32.739
My father was a corpsman.

05:32.740 --> 05:35.142
It's the most common cause
of death on the battlefield.

05:35.143 --> 05:39.213
- And a death usually associated
with alcoholism.

05:40.848 --> 05:44.218
- Goth queen outfit.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.919
Please.
Thank you.

05:45.920 --> 05:51.425
Uh, quotes here
by foucault, kant.

05:51.426 --> 05:53.827
Look at this.

05:53.828 --> 05:55.596
Look at this.

05:55.597 --> 05:58.632
Oh, this takes me
to my dad's study.

05:58.633 --> 06:00.767
- Something interesting.
- Yeah.

06:00.768 --> 06:04.571
This is the red book
by carl jung,

06:04.572 --> 06:07.040
The newly published edition.
- I don't follow.

06:07.041 --> 06:11.345
- Oh, the red book
was, uh, for half a century

06:11.346 --> 06:12.846
Only pirated.

06:12.847 --> 06:15.849
It reigned as the most
influential unpublished book

06:15.850 --> 06:17.217
In the history of psychology.

06:17.218 --> 06:19.620
- Why didn't jung
want it published?

06:19.621 --> 06:22.956
- Well, it recorded,
uh, his own confrontation

06:22.957 --> 06:24.858
With his unconscious.

06:24.859 --> 06:29.663
Thoughts and visions so weird,
they frightened him.

06:29.664 --> 06:32.232
He thought everybody
should have a red book--

06:32.233 --> 06:36.570
All disturbing thoughts
written down and filed away.

06:36.571 --> 06:38.839
- There's--
there's an inscription.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.041
"come discover
a deeper spiritual life.

06:41.042 --> 06:43.143
Struggle with evil
and integrate the devil...

06:43.144 --> 06:45.545
Welcome to the journey.
K."

06:45.546 --> 06:49.816
- Very trippy stuff.
So who's "k"?

06:49.817 --> 06:53.487
- Detectives, the victim's
father and sister are here.

06:55.256 --> 06:57.991
- [crying]

06:57.992 --> 07:00.727
Sarah was always different.

07:00.728 --> 07:03.997
In our teens, when I was reading
young romance,

07:03.998 --> 07:07.834
She read poe, lovecraft,
all kinds of occult stuff.

07:07.835 --> 07:10.837
- That's still reflected in
her choice of dress and decor.

07:10.838 --> 07:12.272
- Detectives,
we know so little.

07:12.273 --> 07:15.008
We--we shouldn't jump
to assumptions here.

07:15.009 --> 07:17.911
- We make an effort
not to do that, congressman.

07:17.912 --> 07:20.314
Uh, you live here
in the city.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.850
Did you see her often?
- We met for lunches.

07:23.851 --> 07:26.386
I knew something was wrong
by the way she was dressing

07:26.387 --> 07:28.121
And her eye makeup.

07:28.122 --> 07:32.059
But she'd laugh and say
it was just a fashion statement.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.560
- What about people she knew?

07:33.561 --> 07:35.529
Ever met anyone
she was close to?

07:35.530 --> 07:38.031
- I haven't.
Caroline, have you met anyone?

07:38.032 --> 07:41.201
- We believe she was close to
or possibly involved

07:41.202 --> 07:43.236
With someone
whose initial was "k."

07:43.237 --> 07:46.306
- Lately, she's shared
so little with me.

07:46.307 --> 07:48.375
- She was going through
a phase.

07:48.376 --> 07:51.378
- Dad, it started
before she left home.

07:51.379 --> 07:53.380
- What did you notice,
caroline?

07:53.381 --> 07:55.782
- Sarah hated dad's world--

07:55.783 --> 07:58.085
The campaigning,
the--the public life,

07:58.086 --> 08:02.155
Always telling the media
that everything's perfect.

08:02.156 --> 08:05.826
She longed to escape
and find something else.

08:05.827 --> 08:09.396
- Whatever she found
killed her.

08:09.397 --> 08:13.166
- [crying]

08:13.167 --> 08:15.235
- "going through a phase."
I've said that.

08:15.236 --> 08:16.737
Hell, most parents
have said that.

08:16.738 --> 08:19.473
- They seem pretty out of touch
with her.

08:19.474 --> 08:21.508
- You know, when my oldest
daughter got a small tattoo,

08:21.509 --> 08:23.009
I thought the next thing
was gonna be

08:23.010 --> 08:25.645
The downtown club scene
and then rehab.

08:25.646 --> 08:27.781
Instead, she's at columbia
in pre-med.

08:27.782 --> 08:31.518
So maybe sarah just needed
some room.

08:31.519 --> 08:33.253
So when the calls
start coming in

08:33.254 --> 08:35.155
From whomever
the ohio congressman leans on,

08:35.155 --> 08:36.756
What words of encouragement
can I give them?

08:36.758 --> 08:38.759
- Well, one of our first steps
is gonna be to uncover

08:38.760 --> 08:40.193
His daughter's missing life.

08:40.193 --> 08:42.328
- Kids in the dorm said
she skipped a lot of classes,

08:42.330 --> 08:43.864
But aced exams.

08:43.865 --> 08:46.266
There was one psych class
that really held her interest.

08:46.267 --> 08:48.335
- We were thinking
it might've been the subject,

08:48.336 --> 08:51.538
Or it might've been
the professor.

08:51.539 --> 08:53.807
- It's a good place to start.

08:56.544 --> 08:59.279
- She had promise.
She worshipped jung.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.547
We shared that.

09:00.548 --> 09:01.715
- Freud gets the credit,

09:01.716 --> 09:05.185
But jung probed
the deep, dark depths, yeah?

09:05.186 --> 09:07.154
- I can almost agree
with that.

09:07.155 --> 09:09.289
- So did she do her homework?
- Sometimes.

09:09.290 --> 09:10.557
- But she passed
all the tests.

09:10.558 --> 09:12.025
- She had
an intuitive understanding

09:12.026 --> 09:13.427
Of jung's theories.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.595
- Yes, the thing
you shared with her.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.197
- In class, only in class.

09:17.198 --> 09:19.433
- Beyond your classroom,
her life is a mystery?

09:19.434 --> 09:20.967
- Yes, to me, it was.

09:20.968 --> 09:23.470
- Somebody gave her
the newly published red book.

09:23.471 --> 09:26.006
- Well, then someone picked
the right gift for sarah.

09:26.007 --> 09:28.742
- Somebody
who signs themself "k."

09:28.743 --> 09:32.712
- There's no "k" in my name,
if that's where you're going.

09:32.713 --> 09:35.215
- Uneasy. Arrogant. Petulant.
- Yeah.

09:35.216 --> 09:37.751
Makes him ideally suited
for academia,

09:37.752 --> 09:39.619
But not necessarily guilty.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.888
- Sarah was clearly pulled
by both worlds

09:41.889 --> 09:43.290
And a dozen school clubs--

09:43.291 --> 09:45.358
Running for treasurer
of the student body,

09:45.359 --> 09:47.194
Yet dressing like a goth.

09:47.195 --> 09:49.696
- Hmm. Stacy mendelson
would never have done that.

09:49.697 --> 09:52.666
- Who?
- Our valedictorian...

09:52.667 --> 09:56.169
President of the, uh,
senior council, every club.

09:56.170 --> 09:59.940
I-I can't picture stacy
as as goth...

09:59.941 --> 10:03.009
Although she did marry
a biker.

10:03.010 --> 10:04.511
You never really know,
do you?

10:04.512 --> 10:06.546
[cell phone beeping]

10:06.547 --> 10:10.050
- Sarah's phone records
are in.

10:10.051 --> 10:12.018
- But any parent who has gone
through similar grief

10:12.019 --> 10:16.022
Knows these are young people
who society overall has failed.

10:16.023 --> 10:20.126
- Sarah's father--
he's used the word "phase"

10:20.127 --> 10:22.462
Four times
in this one interview.

10:22.463 --> 10:23.964
What do you got?
You got something?

10:23.965 --> 10:26.199
- Kyle, as in "k" wyler,

10:26.200 --> 10:28.268
He called her
numerous times daily.

10:28.269 --> 10:30.070
I've got a dmv photo.

10:30.071 --> 10:31.404
He's from rhinebeck.

10:31.405 --> 10:33.206
- He's kind of
wholesome-looking.

10:33.207 --> 10:35.108
Name pop any placelse--
the school?

10:35.109 --> 10:36.910
- He was registered,
but dropped out last quarter.

10:36.911 --> 10:38.345
And there's an address.

10:38.346 --> 10:41.381
- Mm-hmm.
We should invite him in.

10:41.382 --> 10:45.185
- I'm still
just taking it all in.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.853
It doesn't feel real.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.523
- Well, it didn't look real,
I'll tell you.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.625
It looked, uh, more like

10:51.626 --> 10:54.861
Some nightmare illustration
from the red book.

10:54.862 --> 10:58.198
- This is the inscribed copy
you gave her.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.700
- Yeah. Uh, we're--we're both
into jung.

11:00.701 --> 11:04.037
- "the prophet
of our personal darkness"?

11:04.038 --> 11:07.774
- Who o-offered an understanding
of who we really are.

11:07.775 --> 11:09.576
- Were you with sarah
last night?

11:09.577 --> 11:13.346
- No. I pulled an all-nighter
studying in my dorm room.

11:13.347 --> 11:17.751
- Why'd you bother?
You dropped out last semester.

11:19.186 --> 11:22.322
- It's not a good idea
to lie this early on

11:22.323 --> 11:24.658
In an interview, kyle.

11:24.659 --> 11:28.094
- Uh, look,
I-I-I like sarah.

11:28.095 --> 11:32.499
Uh, I'm really upset
that she's dead,

11:32.500 --> 11:34.467
But lately
we haven't been in touch.

11:34.468 --> 11:37.270
- Now you've made
matters worse.

11:37.271 --> 11:40.941
At 7:13 last night, cell records
indicate you called her.

11:40.942 --> 11:43.376
- One more try
at a straight answer.

11:43.377 --> 11:44.744
Did you see her last night?

11:44.745 --> 11:47.914
- Yeah. We, uh--
we met at a club.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.950
But she went her way.
I went mine.

11:49.951 --> 11:52.619
I didn't--I never realized
that this would be the last time

11:52.620 --> 11:53.853
I'd ever see her.

11:53.854 --> 11:55.288
- What was the name
of this club?

11:55.289 --> 11:56.489
- The holy mother.

11:56.490 --> 11:58.124
People that--who were there
can tell you

11:58.125 --> 12:00.961
That I didn't leave with her.

12:00.962 --> 12:04.097
- Mm-hmm. Right here
in sarah's red book,

12:04.098 --> 12:08.001
"we must struggle with evil
and integrate the devil..."

12:08.002 --> 12:09.936
What'd you mean by that?

12:09.937 --> 12:13.340
- It--it was just exploring
boundaries.

12:13.341 --> 12:16.977
Sarah and I wanted something
real and authentic.

12:16.978 --> 12:19.112
- Would you say
she found it?

12:22.149 --> 12:24.784
- No. No.

12:35.429 --> 12:37.731
I don't know
what drugs we took,

12:37.732 --> 12:40.734
But I am completely blank.

12:40.735 --> 12:44.738
- Really? Well, I remember
everything we did.

12:44.739 --> 12:47.607
No, I wouldn't blame
the drugs.

12:47.608 --> 12:49.275
I mean,
when you saw her in there

12:49.276 --> 12:51.645
And anton was doing her,

12:51.646 --> 12:54.814
It had to piss you off.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.150
- Yeah. I mean, I confronted her
in the alley,

12:57.151 --> 12:59.786
And it got a little heavy,
but I didn't--

12:59.787 --> 13:01.921
Later, I'm not sure
what I did.

13:01.922 --> 13:06.192
- Well, maybe you broke through,
completed a dark passage.

13:06.193 --> 13:09.195
That's wild.
- It's wild, virgil?

13:09.196 --> 13:10.997
I'm a murder suspect.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.400
- So I'll tell them
you were with me--

13:13.401 --> 13:14.501
Whatever you want.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.370
- But for myself,
I need to know.

13:17.371 --> 13:21.408
- You came here,
and you trust me.

13:21.409 --> 13:25.145
- Yeah.
What we did...

13:25.146 --> 13:27.213
I didn't know
where else to go.

13:27.214 --> 13:30.784
- What we did
was our beginning.

13:30.785 --> 13:33.720
Sarah is a part of the past.

13:36.090 --> 13:38.391
- She cleaned up pretty good.

13:38.392 --> 13:39.893
- Yeah?
What's the story?

13:39.894 --> 13:42.262
- Aw, never rush
the good stuff.

13:42.263 --> 13:47.133
So vaginal penetration
approximately two to three hours

13:47.134 --> 13:49.736
Before her actual death.

13:49.737 --> 13:51.938
And the guy left a little
of himself behind.

13:51.939 --> 13:53.306
- Dna?

13:53.307 --> 13:56.309
- Codis matched dna coding
to jeremy parks,

13:56.310 --> 13:58.178
A former resident of rikers.

13:58.179 --> 13:59.279
- Well, this is good.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.182
Six months
for selling club drugs.

14:02.183 --> 14:03.850
Uh, but other than that,

14:03.851 --> 14:06.252
Pretty unimpressive
criminally speaking.

14:06.253 --> 14:09.022
- So she had sex,
went home, passed out,

14:09.023 --> 14:10.690
A vein ruptures
in her esophagus,

14:10.691 --> 14:12.525
She vomits blood,
and chokes to death.

14:12.526 --> 14:13.860
Are we looking
at a poisoning?

14:13.861 --> 14:16.096
- Ah, that brings us
to the problem of a tox screen,

14:16.097 --> 14:19.833
Which requires her blood.

14:19.834 --> 14:23.703
Sarah price was drained.

14:23.704 --> 14:26.439
- Drained?
- Totally dry.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.242
Drainage points
in the right femoral artery.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.777
Missed it at the crime scene.

14:30.778 --> 14:32.846
- With all the blood on the body
and the bedding,

14:32.847 --> 14:34.347
Can you use that
for toxicology?

14:34.348 --> 14:37.817
- All that blood she vomited
didn't belong to her.

14:37.818 --> 14:39.285
It was someone else's.

14:48.614 --> 14:51.582
- Vomited blood
that wasn't her own?

14:51.583 --> 14:54.519
Talk about a tabloid headline
that writes itself.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.687
- And her taste in blood
was for a rare vintage,

14:56.688 --> 14:58.256
Duffy-negative,

14:58.257 --> 15:00.157
Mainly present in people
of west african descent.

15:00.158 --> 15:01.692
- West africa?

15:01.693 --> 15:04.161
Don't you tell me you're gonna
bring voodoo into the mix.

15:04.162 --> 15:07.031
- No. The rarity of that blood
is actually a lucky break.

15:07.032 --> 15:09.166
Hospitals are hard-pressed
to keep a supply.

15:09.167 --> 15:11.469
We might get lucky
with a, uh, blood bank canvass.

15:11.470 --> 15:13.638
- And the dna match
on the semen?

15:13.639 --> 15:15.373
- His name is jeremy parks.

15:15.374 --> 15:18.309
He was released from rikers
six months ago and disappeared.

15:18.310 --> 15:20.411
- Ah, flew away on bat wings,
did he?

15:20.412 --> 15:22.213
Look, can we have
something real, please--

15:22.214 --> 15:24.148
Something that wasn't drawn
from current hit movies,

15:24.149 --> 15:25.650
Maybe a prior case?

15:25.651 --> 15:28.953
- There was a real event
ten years ago

15:28.954 --> 15:31.222
In melbourne, florida.

15:31.223 --> 15:35.192
Uh, john crutchley abducted
a 19-year-old girl.

15:35.193 --> 15:36.694
She was raped and tortured,

15:36.695 --> 15:38.729
And he drained 45%
of her blood,

15:38.730 --> 15:41.165
But she didn't die
and managed to escape.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.633
- Good.
You call the cops down there.

15:42.634 --> 15:44.201
You find out
if this crutchely guy

15:44.202 --> 15:46.170
Was part
of a wider cult movement.

15:46.171 --> 15:48.739
And can we confirm
the boyfriend's alibi?

15:48.740 --> 15:50.107
- If he doesn't come up
with some names,

15:50.108 --> 15:51.475
He's coming back in.

15:51.476 --> 15:53.311
- Meanwhile, we're gonna get
the dorm security tape,

15:53.312 --> 15:54.645
See who shows up.

15:54.646 --> 15:56.347
- Good.

15:56.348 --> 15:58.649
- Well,
he sure looks wasted.

15:58.650 --> 16:01.085
- That looks like kyle.
- Yeah, it's kyle.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.321
But it doesn't look like he's,
uh, toting any bags of blood

16:03.322 --> 16:04.455
Under his clothes.

16:04.456 --> 16:05.856
And it's not sarah's dorm.

16:05.857 --> 16:08.626
Their security system's
been down since September.

16:08.627 --> 16:10.661
This is kyle
in his own building.

16:10.662 --> 16:11.996
He's walking unsteadily,

16:11.997 --> 16:14.332
But no visible blood
on his clothes.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.067
And the time is 3:41 a.M.

16:16.068 --> 16:18.202
- That almost gives him
an alibi.

16:18.203 --> 16:21.606
On another note,
we have a duffy-negative match.

16:21.607 --> 16:23.574
A harlem blood bank
that buys rare types.

16:23.575 --> 16:26.510
Sarah drank blood that belonged
to souleyman camara,

16:26.511 --> 16:27.678
Formerly of senegal.

16:27.679 --> 16:28.779
- Do we have an address?

16:28.780 --> 16:30.548
- Last known was a flop
on the bowery,

16:30.549 --> 16:31.782
But the clinic says
he hasn't shown up

16:31.783 --> 16:33.417
In over a month to sell blood.

16:33.418 --> 16:35.353
He might've been selling
his blood on the streets.

16:35.354 --> 16:38.956
Prices have gone up, apparently,
since the vampire craze.

16:38.957 --> 16:42.493
- So along with phony watches,
cds, falafel, and kabobs,

16:42.494 --> 16:45.930
There's type "a," "b," "o,"
and duffy-negative.

16:45.931 --> 16:47.498
- Our undercover narcs
say the sellers

16:47.499 --> 16:49.400
Are called "blood whores"--

16:49.401 --> 16:51.535
Mainly junkies.

16:59.845 --> 17:01.112
- N.Y.P.D.

17:01.113 --> 17:04.015
- Hey! Take it easy!

17:04.016 --> 17:07.818
- What, are you nuts?
That's how people get shot.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.186
Souleyman, we just
want to talk.

17:10.188 --> 17:12.323
We just want to talk.

17:12.324 --> 17:15.492
- I did nothing.
Nothing. I'm innocent.

17:15.493 --> 17:18.162
- Yours?

17:18.163 --> 17:20.964
She's beautiful.

17:23.035 --> 17:27.137
Costs a lot of money
to take care of a young family.

17:27.138 --> 17:28.138
You're an illegal.

17:28.140 --> 17:30.441
[baby cries]

17:30.442 --> 17:32.977
- We know you have
limited options.

17:32.978 --> 17:35.646
- What is this about?
- We know you sell blood.

17:35.647 --> 17:38.149
We know
you're duffy-negative.

17:38.150 --> 17:42.386
Do you know this man--
jeremy parks?

17:42.387 --> 17:45.623
- What did he do?
- Maybe nothing.

17:45.624 --> 17:48.292
But we need to speak
with him.

17:48.293 --> 17:50.795
- I know him,
but his name's not jeremy.

17:50.796 --> 17:52.329
It's anton.

17:52.330 --> 17:53.931
- He buys from you?

17:53.932 --> 17:57.802
- Because I'm clean--
no aids, no disease.

17:57.803 --> 18:00.137
Also, he likes
that my blood is rare.

18:00.138 --> 18:03.741
- Do you know his last name?

18:03.742 --> 18:06.210
- We meet up outside
one of the clubs.

18:06.211 --> 18:09.380
He wears strange clothes,
like from another time.

18:17.589 --> 18:19.323
- Right look?

18:19.324 --> 18:21.192
- And me without my purell.

18:21.193 --> 18:24.228
- Hard to imagine that all these
people weren't just born here,

18:24.229 --> 18:26.964
That they had other lives.
- Uh-huh. Many still do--

18:26.965 --> 18:30.501
Jobs, kids at home,
little wifey over the stove.

18:30.502 --> 18:32.036
- Oh, we've been made.

18:32.037 --> 18:34.371
- You beautiful people...

18:34.372 --> 18:37.975
Especially you--
magnificent.

18:37.976 --> 18:40.611
Too beautiful
to be in my place.

18:40.612 --> 18:43.547
Just, please, no badges--
bad for business.

18:43.548 --> 18:45.783
What do you need?

18:45.784 --> 18:48.285
How can I speed your exit?

18:48.286 --> 18:50.621
- We're looking for people
who drink human blood.

18:50.622 --> 18:54.358
- I see.
And this is strange to you?

18:54.359 --> 18:57.027
- I was a boy scout.

18:57.028 --> 18:58.896
- Yes, some drink blood.

18:58.897 --> 19:01.365
People don't come here
to hide who they are.

19:01.366 --> 19:02.700
The darkness flows.

19:02.701 --> 19:05.669
- Really? Flows to what purpose?
- Self-awareness.

19:05.670 --> 19:08.639
Dr. Jung suggested
"face your demons.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.107
"get to know, even love them,

19:10.108 --> 19:11.976
And you've opened up
your soul."

19:11.977 --> 19:14.011
- Ever open up his soul?

19:14.012 --> 19:17.814
- I'd have no business
if I couldn't keep secrets.

19:17.815 --> 19:20.650
- Suborning evidence, impeding
a murder investigation--

19:20.651 --> 19:22.952
Having no business
won't be your major problem.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.356
- My partner's very locked
into the reality-based.

19:26.357 --> 19:30.527
- Okay, I don't need
police problems.

19:30.528 --> 19:33.296
Anton lebrun.

19:33.297 --> 19:37.534
I've heard him brag about having
a loft in carmine street.

19:37.535 --> 19:39.436
- Some people
need to push limits.

19:39.437 --> 19:41.104
Ignoring any element
of our nature,

19:41.105 --> 19:43.740
Even the darker sides,
limits knowing who we are.

19:43.741 --> 19:46.276
- Is that the hermetic wisdom
of jung's red book

19:46.277 --> 19:49.679
Or your own rationale
for cheap thrills?

19:49.680 --> 19:51.981
- Foucault called them
"limit experiences"--

19:51.982 --> 19:54.017
Going beyond
where you feel is safe.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.185
It's similar to meditation.

19:55.186 --> 19:56.486
- With meditation,

19:56.487 --> 19:59.155
You give yourself over
to a sense of harmony, of peaee.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.191
- But erasing the boundaries
between the conscious

20:01.192 --> 20:04.127
And the unconscious,
who knows what you'll find?

20:04.128 --> 20:07.964
- Like a vampire craze
posing as a faith?

20:07.965 --> 20:12.302
All: I am powerful,
more powerful than others.

20:12.303 --> 20:14.671
I am stronger.

20:14.672 --> 20:17.173
I have a greater reserve
of health.

20:17.174 --> 20:20.110
I will not die.

20:20.111 --> 20:23.113
I have power over others.

20:23.114 --> 20:25.381
- Anton lebrun?

20:25.382 --> 20:28.618
Or is it jeremy parks?

20:28.619 --> 20:31.254
Can we have a moment
in private, jerry?

20:31.255 --> 20:33.690
- [chuckles]
we have nothing to hide nor fear

20:33.691 --> 20:37.527
From mortals such as these.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.829
I will speak,
but only before them.

20:39.830 --> 20:41.598
- Oh, you want to make it
performance art?

20:41.599 --> 20:43.099
We're gonna limit you
to a small room

20:43.100 --> 20:44.501
And an audience of us.

20:44.502 --> 20:47.871
- Give us space.

20:47.872 --> 20:52.041
- So now on to sarah price.
- Ah, yes.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.977
The headlines
that brought you.

20:53.978 --> 20:55.445
- Along with the dna
from the semen

20:55.446 --> 20:58.281
Found inside her body.

20:58.282 --> 21:00.450
- Ah, well,
many offer themselves

21:00.451 --> 21:02.852
To the leader of a coven.

21:02.853 --> 21:04.621
- If you want to brag
about your conquests,

21:04.622 --> 21:07.323
Let's stay focused
on the one who was murdered.

21:07.324 --> 21:10.193
- Wine?
- Mm.

21:10.194 --> 21:11.961
- You mind
if I check the, uh...?

21:11.962 --> 21:13.496
- By all means.

21:22.339 --> 21:26.743
Welcome to the darkest part
of the dark side, detective.

21:26.744 --> 21:30.480
- You're a vampire?

21:30.481 --> 21:32.182
You drink human blood?

21:41.756 --> 21:43.123
- Very impressive.

21:43.124 --> 21:44.791
Do you practice in the mirror
after yoga?

21:44.792 --> 21:46.960
- Top-dollar veneers
on those fangs--

21:46.961 --> 21:49.462
Park avenue dentist.

21:49.463 --> 21:52.465
- [sighs]
you guys are wasting my time.

21:52.466 --> 21:54.134
You can only hold me
for another six hours

21:54.135 --> 21:55.201
Without charging me.

21:55.202 --> 21:56.202
- What's your hurry?

21:56.203 --> 21:57.437
I thought you guys
were immortal.

21:57.438 --> 21:58.738
- [chuckles]

21:58.739 --> 22:00.407
- We matched the blood
in your refrigerator

22:00.408 --> 22:02.409
With the ten pints missing
from sarah price.

22:02.410 --> 22:04.577
We'll hold you longer
than six hours.

22:04.578 --> 22:07.580
- I did not kill
sarah price.

22:07.581 --> 22:09.616
- Then explain away the dna.

22:09.617 --> 22:12.552
- No, no, no.
No, no, no.

22:12.553 --> 22:15.655
I didn't say
I didn't have her.

22:15.656 --> 22:17.857
But she was, oh, so willing.

22:17.858 --> 22:21.695
- How'd you meet?
- At the holy mother.

22:21.696 --> 22:24.297
I saw two beautiful people...

22:24.298 --> 22:27.300
Ripened fruit just begging
to be plucked.

22:27.301 --> 22:30.003
Miss price
and, uh, her boyfriend,

22:30.004 --> 22:32.572
Um, kale or colin
or something.

22:32.573 --> 22:35.742
- Kyle.
- Kyle.

22:35.743 --> 22:38.178
I debated, and then
my hetero animus won out,

22:38.179 --> 22:40.346
And I picked her.

22:40.347 --> 22:43.783
We drank blood and had sex--

22:43.784 --> 22:47.387
You know, good, clean fun.

22:47.388 --> 22:51.024
You should try it sometime.

22:51.025 --> 22:53.493
- The blood was foreplay.

22:53.494 --> 22:55.662
- Blood arouses.

22:55.663 --> 22:58.798
But I don't kill for it,
in case you're interested.

22:58.799 --> 23:01.801
- You only reported
$45,000 of income

23:01.802 --> 23:03.937
For your faith-based,
nonprofit coven.

23:03.938 --> 23:07.107
But you live pretty well
as a vampire.

23:07.108 --> 23:09.142
- Oh, well...

23:09.143 --> 23:10.477
You can attribute that

23:10.478 --> 23:15.148
To bored upper east side women

23:15.149 --> 23:17.517
Who pay for encounters.

23:17.518 --> 23:20.920
Love in "vein,"
if you'll allow the pun.

23:20.921 --> 23:23.323
- These women,
the upper east side addresses,

23:23.324 --> 23:25.759
Are your clients?

23:25.760 --> 23:29.262
- Where anton takes
his liquid lunch...

23:29.263 --> 23:33.266
Which brings me to my alibi.

23:33.267 --> 23:36.169
After sarah,
I enjoyed the company

23:36.170 --> 23:38.838
Of a lovely young lady

23:38.839 --> 23:41.841
By the name
of michelle linden.

23:41.842 --> 23:44.744
[knock at door]

23:48.616 --> 23:50.917
- Preliminary tests
on the confiscated blood.

23:50.918 --> 23:52.986
It's not sarah's.

23:52.987 --> 23:55.121
- And I was starting to enjoy
his company.

23:55.122 --> 23:56.456
- Where is he?
I understand you've got him.

23:56.457 --> 23:57.891
- We heard you found
a refrigerator

23:57.892 --> 23:59.325
Full of human blood.

23:59.326 --> 24:00.927
- There is someone of interest--
- I want to see him.

24:00.928 --> 24:02.128
- It's not a good idea.
- In here?

24:02.129 --> 24:04.964
- Congressman, congressman.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.299
- I'm sarah's father.

24:06.300 --> 24:09.536
[chair rattles loudly]

24:12.273 --> 24:14.808
We had a home.

24:14.809 --> 24:17.043
We had a family.

24:17.044 --> 24:19.679
You took that.
- Your daughter came willingly.

24:19.680 --> 24:23.349
She fled your lies
and hypocrisy

24:23.350 --> 24:25.018
And your unhappiness.

24:25.019 --> 24:26.419
I don't take them.

24:26.420 --> 24:28.188
Parents like you
send them to me.

24:28.189 --> 24:31.124
- Why--
- okay. Hey, hey, hey.

24:31.125 --> 24:34.160
- They'll come.
They'll always come.

24:34.161 --> 24:36.796
And there's nothing you can do
to stop them.

24:36.797 --> 24:38.665
[chuckles]

24:40.768 --> 24:42.802
- My name
was in his address book?

24:42.803 --> 24:44.871
- He speaks
as if he knows you.

24:44.872 --> 24:47.340
- My husband
is the president of a bank.

24:47.341 --> 24:50.343
What on earth would I be doing
with some creature

24:50.344 --> 24:51.878
Who calls himself a vampire?

24:51.879 --> 24:53.112
- So you're not afraid?

24:53.113 --> 24:54.747
- He's given you as his alibi
for murder.

24:54.748 --> 24:57.383
- I should consult
our attorney.

24:57.384 --> 25:00.820
- Mrs. Linden, this clearly has
the potential for embarrassment.

25:00.821 --> 25:03.022
But he claims
that you contracted his services

25:03.023 --> 25:04.591
The night that sarah price
was killed.

25:04.592 --> 25:07.794
- Ridiculous.
I was at an event.

25:07.795 --> 25:10.396
- Mm-hmm.
How'd you get there?

25:10.397 --> 25:12.632
- We have our own driver.

25:12.633 --> 25:14.968
- We'll need to speak
with him.

25:16.470 --> 25:18.471
- Those pearls...

25:18.472 --> 25:20.773
It's a very lovely choker.

25:20.774 --> 25:21.875
- It was my mother's.

25:21.876 --> 25:24.477
- Mind if I look?

25:24.478 --> 25:28.481
Mrs. Linden,
you could be in danger.

25:28.482 --> 25:29.916
Show me what you're hiding.

25:29.917 --> 25:33.653
Show me.

25:41.695 --> 25:45.965
- I know what
you're thinking, but...

25:45.966 --> 25:48.835
It's very...Intimate.

25:48.836 --> 25:50.970
It--it...

25:50.971 --> 25:53.206
It feels...

25:53.207 --> 25:57.377
I-it's very different
than what I'm used to.

26:02.283 --> 26:05.985
We were together
until first light...

26:05.986 --> 26:07.320
Of dawn, I mean.

26:07.321 --> 26:10.390
- How'd you meet him?

26:10.391 --> 26:12.992
- I have a friend
who is the patron

26:12.993 --> 26:16.796
Of a avant-garde poet,
a brilliant and budding rimbaud.

26:16.797 --> 26:18.298
His name is virgil.

26:18.299 --> 26:21.467
He, uh--
she brought him over,

26:21.468 --> 26:24.304
And he brought anton.

26:24.305 --> 26:27.440
- Any sense of the relationship
between anton and virgil?

26:27.441 --> 26:29.842
- Possibly sexual.

26:29.843 --> 26:33.746
Uh, virgil said
he was anton's protege.

26:33.747 --> 26:35.181
He arranged our meetings.

26:35.182 --> 26:37.083
- So you have a way
of ctacting him.

26:37.084 --> 26:39.752
- Yes.

26:46.093 --> 26:47.727
- I didn't hear you come in.

26:47.728 --> 26:50.229
- No one ever does.

26:50.230 --> 26:52.565
You know,
it's like home in here--

26:52.566 --> 26:56.970
Such peace
and total, absolute devotion.

26:56.971 --> 26:59.973
Brought my own tonight.

26:59.974 --> 27:02.208
I heeded the call.

27:04.411 --> 27:06.579
Special.

27:06.580 --> 27:08.081
- Special?

27:08.082 --> 27:11.451
- To prepare you
for the demands from beyond.

27:13.554 --> 27:15.154
- But I obey your demands.

27:15.155 --> 27:18.057
- Nothing's real until...

27:18.058 --> 27:20.893
It was taken.

27:20.894 --> 27:23.830
A demand was made.
I obeyed.

27:23.831 --> 27:26.232
Some would call that madness.

27:27.835 --> 27:31.304
Drink.

27:31.305 --> 27:33.673
It is sarah's blood.

27:33.674 --> 27:36.376
Taste the adrenaline.

27:36.377 --> 27:40.680
That was the fear
that coursed through her.

27:40.681 --> 27:43.516
Yes, that excites you.

27:45.219 --> 27:48.421
I'm special.

27:48.422 --> 27:51.624
I will not die.

27:51.625 --> 27:56.029
My belief will always give me
power over others.

27:57.631 --> 28:02.702
A coven is no place
for pretenders, my love.

28:02.703 --> 28:06.672
- Virgil is an a.K.A.
For jonathan parish.

28:06.673 --> 28:09.008
Born 1984 in altha, florida.

28:09.009 --> 28:10.676
There's an arrest
for lewd behavior,

28:10.677 --> 28:12.578
Plus indecent exposure.

28:12.579 --> 28:13.713
- Florida, 1984--

28:13.714 --> 28:15.248
He was only 12
when the blood draining

28:15.249 --> 28:16.749
Of that earlier girl occurred.

28:16.750 --> 28:18.751
- Yeah, but that must've been
heavily covered in the news.

28:18.752 --> 28:21.888
Rich fodder for the adolescent
masturbatorial fantasies

28:21.889 --> 28:23.356
Of a disturbed youth.

28:23.357 --> 28:24.991
- Combining arousal and death.

28:24.992 --> 28:27.326
- Yeah, and there are more
elements of a deprived youth.

28:27.327 --> 28:29.796
Father spent most
of the kid's life in jail.

28:29.797 --> 28:31.597
- Mom was
a working role model--

28:31.598 --> 28:33.733
Steady employment
at a meatpacking facility.

28:33.734 --> 28:36.269
- Once again,
the presence of blood.

28:36.270 --> 28:39.105
- And a possible fixation
on his mother.

28:39.106 --> 28:41.407
- So we started with jung,

28:41.408 --> 28:42.809
Then switched to freud.

28:42.810 --> 28:45.178
The boy sees his mother
coming home from work

28:45.179 --> 28:46.979
Covered in blood.

28:46.980 --> 28:49.849
She showers.
He watches her.

28:49.850 --> 28:52.151
- He constructs violent,
erotic images.

28:52.152 --> 28:53.786
Maybe brings in
some vampire stuff.

28:53.787 --> 28:55.721
- No shortage of that
in our world.

28:55.722 --> 28:58.091
- Then blood becomes connected
to his arousal.

28:58.092 --> 28:59.659
- It's the same
basic behavior

28:59.660 --> 29:01.794
That can kick-start
a serial killer.

29:01.795 --> 29:05.798
[cell phone beeping]

29:05.799 --> 29:07.633
- The state tax board--

29:07.634 --> 29:10.002
Guess where virgil's
currently employed?

29:13.006 --> 29:15.274
- Sarah price...

29:15.275 --> 29:16.909
Yes, I met her.

29:16.910 --> 29:19.345
But I was much more taken
with her handsome boyfriend,

29:19.346 --> 29:20.947
Kyle.

29:20.948 --> 29:23.716
Only for a short while--
they were both pretenders.

29:23.717 --> 29:26.486
- Pretenders?
- Groupies.

29:26.487 --> 29:29.689
They can be fun,
but short-lived.

29:29.690 --> 29:32.024
Oh, was that insensitive?

29:32.025 --> 29:35.128
- Deliberately so.
You people try too hard.

29:35.129 --> 29:37.530
Along with your impressive
demo of the skills needed

29:37.531 --> 29:38.664
To carry out sarah's murder,

29:38.665 --> 29:40.399
Begging us to ask the questi,

29:40.400 --> 29:43.236
Where were you that night
between the hours of 11:00 p.M.

29:43.237 --> 29:44.570
And 2:00 a.M.?

29:44.571 --> 29:47.740
- Home.
Sadly, I was alone.

29:47.741 --> 29:50.710
- Mm. You know,
it's interesting.

29:50.711 --> 29:53.679
Uh, your mother bled dead pigs,
and you're doing this.

29:53.680 --> 29:55.982
Isn't that interesting?

29:55.983 --> 29:57.250
- Interesting.

29:57.251 --> 30:00.052
- Well, prepping meat,
prepping the dead.

30:00.053 --> 30:03.055
In some places, there's
a special caste for that work--

30:03.056 --> 30:04.724
Pariahs, outcasts.

30:04.725 --> 30:07.160
Nobody wants to know them.
- Doesn't bother me.

30:07.161 --> 30:08.628
- Yeah, if it did,
you've overcome it

30:08.629 --> 30:10.396
With a more theatrical identity.

30:10.397 --> 30:13.566
Vampire beats the hell
out of pariah.

30:13.567 --> 30:15.968
- People should respect
what I do.

30:15.969 --> 30:17.970
In the end, everybody ends up
in my hands

30:17.971 --> 30:19.906
Or in the hands of someone
just like me.

30:19.907 --> 30:22.742
- Who don't all claim
to be vampires.

30:22.743 --> 30:26.579
- Does anybody really know
what they are?

30:28.782 --> 30:30.149
Now, unless you plan
to arrest me,

30:30.150 --> 30:32.752
I better finish tending
to mr. Rockwell.

30:43.230 --> 30:46.732
Does it hurt?
- [crying] yes.

30:46.733 --> 30:49.302
But it's good.

30:49.303 --> 30:51.737
[wincing]

30:51.738 --> 30:53.673
Oh, I'm ready for the best.

30:53.674 --> 30:57.577
- Let the pain bear you away
on silent wings,

30:57.578 --> 31:00.646
And there
will be bigger things.

31:02.583 --> 31:06.552
The voice will call to you
as it called to me.

31:06.553 --> 31:08.621
[metal clatters]

31:08.622 --> 31:11.324
Belief requires obedience

31:11.325 --> 31:14.026
To make it real.

31:25.343 --> 31:27.411
- There's no question
in our minds

31:27.412 --> 31:29.246
This virgil guy is real.

31:29.247 --> 31:31.916
- Real what?
And don't say vampire.

31:31.917 --> 31:33.584
- Well, here,
take it down to basics.

31:33.585 --> 31:35.219
He's a textbook psychotic--

31:35.220 --> 31:37.388
Fearless,
devoid of empathy.

31:37.389 --> 31:39.890
But I think also
he's delusional.

31:39.891 --> 31:42.226
- So in his own mind,
he is a vampire?

31:42.227 --> 31:43.761
And he feels
the need for blood,

31:43.762 --> 31:46.297
And now with this cultural fad,
it's readily available to him?

31:46.298 --> 31:47.898
- Killing sarah price
would validate him,

31:47.899 --> 31:49.466
Make him feel authentic.

31:49.467 --> 31:51.735
- More than performance art
in a low-life club scene.

31:51.736 --> 31:53.804
- The upper east side lady
had it wrong.

31:53.805 --> 31:56.307
It's virgil who leads.
Anton follows.

31:56.308 --> 31:58.142
- So virgil,
like his namesake,

31:58.143 --> 32:01.278
Leads those
who are willing to follow...

32:01.279 --> 32:04.114
Into hell.

32:04.115 --> 32:06.851
- Hmm.

32:06.852 --> 32:12.756
- I am priest, prophet,
and pacifier.

32:12.757 --> 32:16.594
Blood, given at birth,
returns in death.

32:18.096 --> 32:21.599
I banish your soul
from this body

32:21.600 --> 32:26.270
And grant you
everlasting life.

32:28.907 --> 32:32.276
You are brave.

32:32.277 --> 32:35.779
You've earned this,
as sarah did.

32:35.780 --> 32:38.182
Prepare yourself.

32:38.183 --> 32:40.851
You will join her.

32:46.291 --> 32:48.626
- To whom it may concern,

32:48.627 --> 32:51.862
This is done
by my will alone.

32:51.863 --> 32:54.665
I am a seeker.

32:54.666 --> 32:58.502
And I release my blood
for others to share.

32:58.503 --> 33:02.673
I fulfill my longing to embrace
the wealth of the spirit.

33:04.609 --> 33:07.077
The psyche does not exist
within the constraints

33:07.078 --> 33:10.214
Of time and space.

33:10.215 --> 33:12.449
The psyche does not exist
within the constraints

33:12.450 --> 33:14.952
Of time and space.

33:19.691 --> 33:21.992
- What an idiotic waste.
- Yeah.

33:21.993 --> 33:23.060
Transcendence...

33:23.061 --> 33:25.362
Death and transfiguration--

33:25.363 --> 33:26.964
Moving from human flesh
to radiance.

33:26.965 --> 33:28.565
It's a common religious theme.

33:28.566 --> 33:31.135
- Want to talk creepy theology,
let's start with him.

33:31.136 --> 33:32.469
- He said anything?

33:32.470 --> 33:33.771
- Claims he walked in
and found the guy.

33:33.772 --> 33:37.474
Did his duty as a citizen,
called 911.

33:37.475 --> 33:39.510
- How would kyle
have gotten into your loft?

33:39.511 --> 33:40.911
- I don't know.

33:40.912 --> 33:43.714
- So people just wander in
and bleed themselves to death?

33:43.715 --> 33:45.082
That's a service you offer?

33:45.083 --> 33:47.484
- The loft is a holy sanctum.

33:47.485 --> 33:51.221
A young man exercised his right
to be at one with his belief.

33:51.222 --> 33:52.856
I don't see the crime
in that.

33:52.857 --> 33:55.092
- Well...

33:55.093 --> 33:57.594
Do you see the crime
in this?

33:57.595 --> 34:00.264
- Sarah price?

34:00.265 --> 34:01.598
We've been through that.

34:01.599 --> 34:03.300
- But not
without fresh evidence.

34:03.301 --> 34:06.904
- See this needle
and the tubing?

34:06.905 --> 34:08.572
The bags used
for blood storage--

34:08.572 --> 34:11.475
They not only had
kyle's blood type,

34:11.476 --> 34:14.043
But also sarah's.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.520
- I don't know
where that came from.

34:23.521 --> 34:27.224
- We do. This equipment
was used to drain her.

34:27.225 --> 34:29.592
Dna will tie you
to sarah's murder.

34:32.429 --> 34:36.500
- You got nothing going for you
at this point, anton,

34:36.501 --> 34:40.404
Except our belief...

34:40.405 --> 34:43.139
That you're innocent.

34:43.141 --> 34:44.408
- What?

34:44.409 --> 34:47.411
- We think it's obvious
you're being framed.

34:47.411 --> 34:49.713
- Unfortunately, what we think
isn't gonna carry

34:49.714 --> 34:51.648
Any weight with the d.A.S.

34:51.649 --> 34:54.150
They're gonna lay
a murder case on you

34:54.152 --> 34:57.654
Just like virgil planned it.

34:57.655 --> 35:00.858
- No. No, virgil is
an elevated person.

35:00.859 --> 35:02.593
He leads the faith.

35:02.594 --> 35:05.629
- He can be pragmatic
when it comes to saving his ass.

35:05.630 --> 35:10.200
- You brought sarah
into your world.

35:10.201 --> 35:13.737
Look.
Look at that.

35:13.738 --> 35:17.541
And this is
how she ended up...

35:17.542 --> 35:21.211
Like that.

35:21.212 --> 35:23.547
So you have feelings.

35:23.548 --> 35:26.583
But virgil has none.

35:26.584 --> 35:30.521
And that's his strength,
his power over you, anton.

35:30.522 --> 35:33.724
- His strength comes in powers
beyond your understanding.

35:33.725 --> 35:36.427
- Uh, his behavior is totally
within our understanding.

35:36.428 --> 35:40.130
There are three textbook phases
of psychopathy.

35:40.131 --> 35:42.533
Phase one is assessment.

35:42.534 --> 35:44.635
When virgil first meets you,
what does he see?

35:44.636 --> 35:47.905
- A year and a half ago,
you were waiting tables.

35:47.906 --> 35:49.907
Is that when you met virgil?

35:52.410 --> 35:53.844
- What of it?

35:53.845 --> 35:56.246
- Well, he decided
that you were worth knowing,

35:56.247 --> 35:57.848
Of value to him.

35:57.849 --> 36:01.218
So he raises you
from waiter to warlock,

36:01.219 --> 36:03.020
Sets you up
with these rich clients.

36:03.021 --> 36:06.223
- No, he raised me
to a greater truth.

36:06.224 --> 36:08.625
- Oh, yeah,
when you're committed,

36:08.626 --> 36:11.962
He moves on to phase two--
manipulation.

36:11.963 --> 36:13.864
You start acting
on his commands.

36:13.865 --> 36:17.201
You find sarah and kyle,
deliver them to virgil.

36:17.202 --> 36:18.335
- Maybe we have it wrong.

36:18.336 --> 36:22.406
Maybe anton killed
sarah and kyle.

36:26.511 --> 36:28.345
- No.
- No.

36:28.346 --> 36:32.082
Killing was a ritual
that took virgil

36:32.083 --> 36:35.252
To a higher level.

36:35.253 --> 36:38.422
He knew it was something
anton couldn't do.

36:38.423 --> 36:40.357
- See this?

36:40.358 --> 36:43.227
Did you do this?
Yes or no?

36:46.331 --> 36:48.532
- Which takes us to the third
and final phase

36:48.533 --> 36:51.735
Of virgil's psychotic behavior--
abandonment.

36:51.736 --> 36:54.138
You couldn't reach
a higher level,

36:54.139 --> 36:55.839
So you were
of no more use to him.

36:55.840 --> 36:59.543
So he plants sarah's blood
in your loft.

37:02.347 --> 37:04.982
- He put you on our altar
for sacrifice.

37:18.930 --> 37:23.367
[footsteps approaching]

37:23.368 --> 37:26.036
- Anton...

37:26.037 --> 37:28.839
I understood
they arrested you.

37:28.840 --> 37:31.141
- They questioned me, yes.

37:33.711 --> 37:37.614
- And you were true
to the faith?

37:37.615 --> 37:39.349
- They showed me
evidence, virgil.

37:42.954 --> 37:46.423
- Please say
you haven't disappointed me.

37:46.424 --> 37:49.092
- Especially with all the effort
you made to frame him,

37:49.093 --> 37:51.295
Right, virgil?

37:51.296 --> 37:53.297
- The cops?

37:53.298 --> 37:56.433
I offer things,
but people aren't appreciative.

37:56.434 --> 38:00.971
I simply wanted anton to know
the true glory of martyrdom.

38:00.972 --> 38:03.840
- We think that's a glory
that you deserve.

38:03.841 --> 38:06.410
- Yeah, if you actually are
what you say you are,

38:06.411 --> 38:08.145
You should be envious
if somebody else gets credit

38:08.146 --> 38:09.146
For your work.

38:09.147 --> 38:11.782
- No, I'm beyond envy...

38:11.783 --> 38:14.585
But not disappointment.

38:14.586 --> 38:15.886
You failed me.

38:15.887 --> 38:19.623
- I believed in you
until you betrayed me, virgil.

38:19.624 --> 38:23.093
- Oh, I always knew
you were weak.

38:23.094 --> 38:26.163
There's so little strength
in this world.

38:26.164 --> 38:28.832
- It doesn't take strength
to have delusions, virgil,

38:28.833 --> 38:30.033
And that's all you have.

38:30.034 --> 38:34.137
- Delusions
are unfounded beliefs.

38:34.138 --> 38:38.942
My beliefs are proven
by everything I do.

38:38.943 --> 38:41.945
Have they taken away...

38:41.946 --> 38:44.815
Everything you know, anton?

38:44.816 --> 38:49.186
Have you nothing left
of our faith?

38:49.187 --> 38:52.823
You remember the pledge.

38:52.824 --> 38:55.926
Am I not the source...

38:55.927 --> 38:59.229
The blood...

38:59.230 --> 39:03.967
The deliverer and the taker?

39:03.968 --> 39:07.904
Sacred words
that bind us as family.

39:07.905 --> 39:11.341
- Planted evidence
cuts a lot of family ties.

39:14.145 --> 39:16.580
- Say the pledge.

39:16.581 --> 39:18.915
Take strength from me.

39:18.916 --> 39:20.384
There are higher levels.

39:20.385 --> 39:23.186
- You've lost him, virgil.

39:23.187 --> 39:24.321
You're alone.

39:24.322 --> 39:26.657
- No...

39:26.658 --> 39:28.659
Never alone.

39:28.660 --> 39:32.129
I will always have
the power of darkness.

39:32.130 --> 39:36.033
- Anton doesn't see it.
We don't see it.

39:36.034 --> 39:38.101
That's because
I will always be

39:38.102 --> 39:41.104
The light
that shines upon you.

39:52.850 --> 39:55.252
- At last, the real you.

39:55.253 --> 39:58.689
- My power is undiminished.

39:58.690 --> 40:01.558
- No, with a little
soap and water,

40:01.559 --> 40:05.162
Your power has vanished.

40:05.163 --> 40:08.265
- Why am I here?

40:08.266 --> 40:10.334
Why this waste
of my time?

40:10.335 --> 40:14.104
- Well, we would be remiss
in our professional obligations

40:14.105 --> 40:18.141
If we didn't
at least mention a plea.

40:18.142 --> 40:19.810
- A plea?

40:19.811 --> 40:22.546
- We have evidence,
witness testimony--

40:22.547 --> 40:24.748
All that's needed
for a murder conviction.

40:24.749 --> 40:27.084
If you allocute,
avoid a trial,

40:27.085 --> 40:29.986
Saves the state
a lot of money.

40:29.987 --> 40:33.023
- You know, you might do better
than life in supermax.

40:33.024 --> 40:36.793
- No.

40:38.194 --> 40:40.195
I want a trial.

40:40.196 --> 40:42.030
- Still desperate.

40:43.031 --> 40:45.768
- Your act really means
that much to you, huh?

40:45.769 --> 40:47.803
- Knowing
that I am eternal

40:47.804 --> 40:49.772
Means that
I have nothing to fear.

40:49.773 --> 40:51.173
- Well, you know,

40:51.174 --> 40:53.742
I think you may be wrong
about that, jonathan.

40:53.743 --> 40:57.646
Locked in an 8-by-12 cell,
no human contact,

40:57.647 --> 41:00.115
No hope of parole,

41:00.116 --> 41:03.985
And time slowing
to a glacial pace.

41:03.986 --> 41:05.454
And there you'll sit...

41:05.455 --> 41:07.723
Just being eternal?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
