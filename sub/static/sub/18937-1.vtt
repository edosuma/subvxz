01:04.431 --> 01:05.125
Are you all right?!

01:26.019 --> 01:27.543
What are they, immortal?

02:06.726 --> 02:09.126
This is bad. Get away from here!

02:29.082 --> 02:31.516
Giant Sand Burial!

02:36.923 --> 02:38.720
You're late, Gaara.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.825
Who are these guys?

02:46.232 --> 02:47.290
I don't know.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.063
They just came out of the sea
when we set up camp for the night.

03:04.617 --> 03:05.549
I'm not letting you get away!

03:05.818 --> 03:07.445
Stop! Don't go after them!

03:30.577 --> 03:34.980
We're at a complete disadvantage
at sea in the dark.

03:35.014 --> 03:36.311
Release the light balls!

03:36.649 --> 03:37.547
Yes!

03:50.897 --> 03:51.921
What is that?

03:52.465 --> 03:54.558
I've never seen
a boat like that before.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.604
This is bad!

05:26.059 --> 05:27.754
All right, go, go!

05:27.960 --> 05:31.054
Hey! This is important.
Be quiet!

05:31.431 --> 05:32.193
Honestly...

05:47.780 --> 05:48.644
He went in!

05:49.349 --> 05:50.043
We did it!

06:04.664 --> 06:06.461
There, there. That's a good boy.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.558
He has black fur on his back legs.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.800
All right, it's him.

06:11.704 --> 06:12.693
Naruto, the cage!

06:15.608 --> 06:19.476
He's so stupid...
falling for such a stupid trap!

06:20.847 --> 06:21.711
Huh?

06:22.682 --> 06:23.546
What is it?

06:23.583 --> 06:25.778
Hey, Naruto! What did you do?!

06:25.952 --> 06:27.419
What did I do?
I just got the cage...

06:28.955 --> 06:30.217
Oww!

06:31.124 --> 06:32.716
You idiot!
Don't let him get away, Naruto!

06:32.759 --> 06:34.522
I'll beat you if he gets away!

06:46.672 --> 06:47.969
You idiot!

07:03.856 --> 07:06.757
Geez. I don't know why someone
would bother paying us

07:06.793 --> 07:10.160
to look for this vicious cat.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.155
Well, don't sulk like that.

07:12.398 --> 07:16.960
Our mission is to find him
and deliver him to his owner.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.469
And he's not a cat. He's a ferret.

07:22.842 --> 07:25.106
Looking closely at him,
he's pretty cute.

07:25.344 --> 07:28.438
Anyway, let's deliver him
and get back to the village.

07:34.253 --> 07:36.346
If we cross that bridge...

07:36.589 --> 07:37.453
All right!

07:37.490 --> 07:38.787
Hey, Naruto, wait!

07:38.925 --> 07:40.950
Let's get this mission over with...!

07:51.437 --> 07:53.371
What are you doing, you idiot?!

07:53.606 --> 07:56.040
It's says there that
this bridge is dangerous!

07:56.075 --> 07:57.406
I don't care about you,

07:57.510 --> 08:00.206
but what would we do
if something happened to the ferret?!

08:00.913 --> 08:03.074
Sakura, that's so mean.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.250
Shikamaru?

08:07.353 --> 08:08.342
What's wrong?

08:09.021 --> 08:14.254
Well... Our request came from
the village beyond that field.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.525
Don't you think it seems
kind of strange?

08:18.998 --> 08:20.260
Strange?

08:20.967 --> 08:24.528
It's noon, but it doesn't look
like anyone's there.

08:24.904 --> 08:26.098
Come to think of it...

08:26.372 --> 08:28.135
You think so?

08:38.851 --> 08:40.842
Let's adopt scouting tactics
from here.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.986
I'll head around to the forest
on the west.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.320
Naruto and Sakura,
you head to the opposite side.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.347
- <i>Roger!</i>
- <i>Roger!</i>

08:47.393 --> 08:49.918
<i>I hope this won't be a hassle....</i>

09:04.143 --> 09:05.576
It's beyond that forest.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.643
Hey! Be quiet!

09:10.349 --> 09:11.748
I wonder what's come over him?

09:23.563 --> 09:24.291
What's this?

09:27.800 --> 09:28.459
Hey...

09:29.602 --> 09:30.694
Hey! What's wrong?!

09:40.313 --> 09:41.678
Who are you guys?!

09:50.189 --> 09:50.951
<i>Naruto!</i>

09:53.859 --> 09:55.292
There are some strange people...

09:55.328 --> 09:56.226
<i>I'm heading there now.</i>

10:04.804 --> 10:05.793
What are they?

10:11.143 --> 10:12.235
In that case...

10:23.389 --> 10:24.583
All right!

10:38.304 --> 10:40.864
U... Zu... Ma... Ki!

10:42.608 --> 10:44.098
Naruto Barrage!

11:24.183 --> 11:26.014
So you're the leader!

11:31.657 --> 11:32.385
Why you!

12:40.059 --> 12:41.026
Sakura!

12:45.831 --> 12:47.059
Naruto!

12:47.666 --> 12:49.600
Let go of me! Hey!

12:49.735 --> 12:50.997
Crap...

12:51.036 --> 12:53.004
Taking hostages is cowardly!

12:54.306 --> 12:56.501
Let go of her right now!

13:14.560 --> 13:15.959
Shadow Possession Jutsu...

13:20.032 --> 13:21.829
Naruto! Leave these guys to me!

13:21.867 --> 13:22.629
All right!

13:22.968 --> 13:25.493
I don't care who you guys are!

13:25.538 --> 13:27.233
I'm going to take care of you
all at once.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.801
Multi Shadow Clone!

13:43.289 --> 13:44.313
Here I go!

14:12.518 --> 14:13.610
Rasengan!

14:13.886 --> 14:15.319
Rising Thunder!

14:33.806 --> 14:34.932
Naruto!

14:48.387 --> 14:49.547
Crap...

14:50.256 --> 14:51.223
Naruto...

14:54.426 --> 14:55.654
Sakura! This way!

15:16.882 --> 15:18.213
What is that?

16:06.899 --> 16:07.729
Oww!

16:25.617 --> 16:29.815
Now that you're up,
try not to move too much...

16:34.793 --> 16:38.251
I didn't think that you'd wake up
for another two or three days, but...

16:39.198 --> 16:40.495
Who are you, Gramps?

16:40.699 --> 16:45.762
Me? I'm Kahiko,
the elder of this caravan.

16:45.804 --> 16:46.702
Caravan?

16:46.772 --> 16:47.796
That's right.

16:47.840 --> 16:52.504
The people of the villages
call us the wandering people.

16:52.811 --> 16:57.612
We travel all over the place,
depending on the season.

16:57.716 --> 16:58.648
Oh?

16:58.684 --> 17:01.175
You were lucky.

17:01.286 --> 17:07.054
You would have been washed away
by the river if we hadn't passed by.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.625
Hey! It's that guy!

17:14.366 --> 17:15.298
Oh?

17:15.768 --> 17:17.929
He's also regained consciousness...

17:20.638 --> 17:22.163
Hey, hey, you!

17:22.207 --> 17:26.233
Why the hell did you
suddenly attack me like that?!

17:28.347 --> 17:32.181
My, my. It's good that
you're full of energy, but...

17:33.886 --> 17:36.081
Anyway, you shouldn't fight.

17:36.121 --> 17:39.181
We help each other as we travel.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.786
But this guy...

17:45.898 --> 17:48.696
Hey! It's you!

18:01.013 --> 18:04.744
I can recover from
most of my wounds in a day.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.311
That's convenient...

18:07.352 --> 18:10.150
But that boy is also pretty impressive...

18:10.489 --> 18:13.652
He's healing as quickly as you are.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.555
Huh? Him, too?

18:21.867 --> 18:24.893
I'm so envious of youth...

18:39.017 --> 18:42.714
Gramps, be careful.
He's really violent.

18:43.956 --> 18:48.416
Nerugui is shy,
but he doesn't bite people.

18:49.394 --> 18:51.157
Do you know him?

18:51.196 --> 18:57.157
Well, he's never left
the caravan until now.

18:57.369 --> 19:01.100
Aren't you glad that
you got back safely, Nerugui?

19:02.641 --> 19:05.007
He's our treasure.

19:05.377 --> 19:10.405
I was the one who hired
the Leaf Village to search for him.

19:10.616 --> 19:12.777
I see. So it was you...

19:13.385 --> 19:16.252
We move all year,

19:16.288 --> 19:20.281
so we wanted him delivered
to a village at the border.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.657
How'd he turn up here again?

19:22.728 --> 19:25.390
Well, that's because he suddenly...

19:28.467 --> 19:30.799
Hey, Nerugui!

19:35.674 --> 19:38.837
Is he really shy?

19:39.811 --> 19:41.870
So I thought...

19:49.254 --> 19:51.950
This area is crawling with those guys.

19:51.990 --> 19:52.979
Yeah.

19:53.058 --> 19:55.390
Who in the world are they?

19:56.094 --> 20:01.532
Who knows?
Sakura, keep looking for Naruto.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.495
If you find him,
inform me by intercom.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.598
Right! What about you?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.562
There's something that I have to do...

21:30.989 --> 21:31.956
Come here...

22:16.868 --> 22:17.835
Master Haido...

22:23.675 --> 22:25.142
Say, say, say, say!

22:25.744 --> 22:28.941
Has this caravan always
been traveling?

22:29.715 --> 22:34.345
That's right. We've been on the road
ever since our country was destroyed.

22:34.753 --> 22:36.618
Ever since your country
was destroyed?

22:38.056 --> 22:40.718
It's a legend that has been passed down
by our clan from long ago.

22:41.360 --> 22:45.126
It says that we had a country,
but it was destroyed.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.161
Hmm... Why?

22:47.399 --> 22:50.334
It seems that, long ago,
there was a great catastrophe.

22:50.936 --> 22:54.736
We lost our country
and our clan was scattered.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.501
We became wandering people...

22:57.609 --> 23:00.442
And it seems that some of us
crossed the sea.

23:02.114 --> 23:03.046
The sea?

23:03.081 --> 23:04.105
That's right.

23:04.149 --> 23:09.018
Nerugui is a ferret that
was kept at our ancestors' palace...

23:09.221 --> 23:13.749
He's living proof that
we had a country long ago.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.421
Gramps, you're kidding, right?

23:16.461 --> 23:19.624
Then that means that
he's lived for a really long time.

23:19.664 --> 23:22.565
Yes. He has lived for
a really long time.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.528
Huh?

23:25.837 --> 23:29.102
Nerugui is even older than Grandpa.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.435
That's ridiculous...

23:31.843 --> 23:34.073
Amazing, isn't it?

23:34.112 --> 23:37.377
We've taken care of him
through the generations.

23:38.784 --> 23:44.017
That's why Nerugui doesn't take
to anyone outside of our caravan...

23:56.201 --> 23:58.362
Or so I thought...

23:58.470 --> 24:00.199
Has he gone to him again?

24:00.705 --> 24:04.368
Nerugui, what's wrong with you?

24:17.355 --> 24:20.324
Hey, hey! Are you talking now?

24:22.894 --> 24:25.226
Why did you suddenly attack me?

24:27.199 --> 24:29.599
Hey! Don't ignore me!

24:31.369 --> 24:33.769
What is your strange power?

24:34.005 --> 24:37.065
Huh? Power? You mean Chakra?

24:37.809 --> 24:38.901
Chakra?

24:42.948 --> 24:45.940
<i>Indeed, I don't sense any Gelel....</i>

24:46.751 --> 24:50.710
Hey, hey, answer my question.
Who the hell are you?

24:52.224 --> 24:53.748
I came to build a utopia.

24:54.092 --> 24:56.424
Uto... What's that?

24:56.695 --> 25:00.529
You have an interesting power.
Come with me.

25:00.832 --> 25:01.890
Huh?

25:02.434 --> 25:05.335
I don't understand what
you're talking about!

25:05.437 --> 25:06.495
Think about it.

25:07.072 --> 25:08.437
No way!

25:08.473 --> 25:10.839
Why do I have to go with you?!

25:10.909 --> 25:12.900
I'm asking you
why you attacked me!

25:12.944 --> 25:15.310
I'm going to tie you up
and take you to the Leaf Village...! Whoa!

25:15.347 --> 25:17.611
Wait! Where are you going?

25:31.530 --> 25:32.861
Hurry up! Hurry up!

25:32.898 --> 25:34.160
Wait for me!

26:06.898 --> 26:07.626
Are they all right?

26:08.633 --> 26:09.531
Are they hurt?

26:11.570 --> 26:12.468
They're okay?

26:13.738 --> 26:14.466
They look all right.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.133
What are you doing?!

26:17.709 --> 26:19.336
Thank you very much.

26:32.357 --> 26:35.383
Now, I've repaid my debt
to these people.

26:57.148 --> 27:00.675
Geez. These guys just
keep on coming...

27:21.773 --> 27:23.331
<i>It doesn't look like</i>
<i>they're conscious.</i>

27:37.589 --> 27:40.456
How long am I going to
have to look after these guys?

27:40.592 --> 27:42.651
Oh my. It's not good
to be short-tempered.

27:44.295 --> 27:45.353
I know!

27:45.664 --> 27:50.158
We won't need them
once we find the Stone of Gelel...

27:51.236 --> 27:52.897
Just be a little more patient.

27:55.907 --> 27:57.966
Well, we need them right now.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.676
He ran away! That bastard!

28:35.980 --> 28:38.949
I won't let you get away!

28:40.985 --> 28:43.317
This is horrible...

28:43.788 --> 28:45.983
Hey, what's wrong, Gramps?

28:46.391 --> 28:49.155
Nerugui isn't here, either.

28:49.194 --> 28:50.991
Does that mean that
he went with him?

28:51.262 --> 28:54.959
Yes... What was the point of spending
a large sum of money

28:54.999 --> 28:57.331
to hire the excellent Leaf Village?

28:58.369 --> 29:01.497
Wait a second!
I just completed your request.

29:01.539 --> 29:05.407
Be quiet. I told you to
deliver him to the <i>next</i> village.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.713
Furthermore, Nerugui isn't here!

29:08.747 --> 29:10.271
That's ridiculous...

29:11.950 --> 29:13.577
If I knew this would happen,

29:13.618 --> 29:17.611
I would have hired the even more
excellent Sand Village from the beginning.

29:17.889 --> 29:20.551
Aw man!
I get it already, believe it!

29:29.000 --> 29:30.024
<i>Naruto....</i>

29:33.071 --> 29:34.868
<i>There are signs that</i>
<i>someone was here....</i>

29:35.607 --> 29:36.767
<i>Could it be?</i>

29:51.923 --> 29:53.652
I finally caught up to you.

29:55.326 --> 29:57.624
Hey, hey! Give me back that cat.

29:59.831 --> 30:01.059
Why you...

30:06.671 --> 30:08.536
Wh-What is this?

30:14.846 --> 30:16.507
Exactly who are you?

30:17.615 --> 30:18.741
My name is Temujin...

30:19.918 --> 30:22.113
Come! I'll introduce you
to Master Haido!

30:22.887 --> 30:24.616
Huh?! H-Hey...

30:24.656 --> 30:26.180
Hold on a minute!

30:28.593 --> 30:31.528
Say, who is this "Master Haido"?

30:32.397 --> 30:35.594
My lord and a person
with a wonderful belief.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.164
You'll understand when you meet him.

30:41.906 --> 30:45.535
Say, are you friends
with those strange guys?

30:46.411 --> 30:48.311
They're just faithful soldiers.

30:49.747 --> 30:51.078
My friends are...

31:25.550 --> 31:26.642
I have returned.

31:28.119 --> 31:29.677
Ah, Temujin.

31:30.288 --> 31:31.687
You're back.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.497
It's you, isn't it?

31:44.969 --> 31:49.906
Temujin informed me that
you have an interesting power.

31:50.775 --> 31:52.572
I shall show you right now.

31:54.212 --> 31:54.769
Wha...?!

31:56.047 --> 31:56.877
What's this?!

31:57.415 --> 31:58.404
Now come on!

31:58.449 --> 32:01.543
No! Stop this unnecessary fighting.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.018
But...

32:03.187 --> 32:06.315
No, fighting is not good.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.892
Naruto, we have journeyed
to create a utopia.

32:19.337 --> 32:21.532
What is a "utopia"?

32:22.106 --> 32:23.164
Well...

32:23.207 --> 32:25.732
Simply put, it is a world
where there are no wars

32:25.777 --> 32:29.508
and the weak aren't oppressed.

32:30.014 --> 32:31.914
A world without wars?

32:32.550 --> 32:35.110
Yes... Our homeland...

32:35.153 --> 32:38.520
is in a far-off continent with
continuous wars...

32:39.457 --> 32:43.951
Wars are always unsightly
and sorrowful.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.623
It brings misfortune to all people.

32:47.465 --> 32:51.731
Temujin here also lost
his homeland to war.

32:51.769 --> 32:53.737
Are you all alone?

32:54.639 --> 32:56.266
I have Master Haido.

32:57.175 --> 33:01.976
Temujin was left behind in
his war-torn village when he was young.

33:02.847 --> 33:04.610
I made a decision.

33:05.183 --> 33:07.674
I wanted to protect the weak...

33:08.519 --> 33:12.478
I wanted to create a world
where no one had to fight.

33:14.459 --> 33:17.826
That is utopia... My dream.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.123
For the sake of my dream,

33:20.164 --> 33:22.428
I've traveled the world
gathering comrades...

33:22.934 --> 33:26.426
It has taken time to get this far.

33:27.972 --> 33:32.306
Unfortunately, there were people who
became noble sacrifices along the way...

33:35.046 --> 33:38.277
Say, Naruto, won't you come with me?

33:39.117 --> 33:42.951
I want you to help me
make this world a better place.

33:43.121 --> 33:44.486
Hmm...

33:44.522 --> 33:49.118
I'd like to go,
but I've got to become Hokage.

33:49.394 --> 33:50.122
Hokage?

33:50.995 --> 33:53.463
The best Ninja in my village.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.464
I see...

33:58.703 --> 34:00.568
Well, I can't go with you,

34:00.605 --> 34:04.302
but I'll also try my best
to make everyone in my village happy!

34:04.409 --> 34:06.741
Then let's both give it our best.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.277
- Huh?
- Oh?

34:09.947 --> 34:11.244
What is that?

34:11.748 --> 34:12.943
I'm very sorry.

34:12.984 --> 34:16.043
He came along with me
from a caravan that I passed...

34:17.054 --> 34:18.022
From a caravan?

34:19.424 --> 34:20.482
I see.

34:25.696 --> 34:26.594
A caravan?

34:27.331 --> 34:28.922
<i>Master Haido! Bad news!</i>

34:29.199 --> 34:30.188
What's wrong?

34:30.534 --> 34:33.368
<i>The fleet that landed in</i>
<i>the Land of Wind was annihilated.</i>

34:33.404 --> 34:34.563
Huh? The Land of Wind?

34:34.605 --> 34:35.572
I'll go!

34:35.639 --> 34:37.540
Hey! What happened?

34:43.047 --> 34:44.878
Oh well, Fugai...

34:44.916 --> 34:45.746
<i>Yes!</i>

34:46.083 --> 34:48.552
There's somewhere
I want you to go.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.567
What is this?

36:03.327 --> 36:04.123
Hey!

36:05.062 --> 36:06.620
What's the meaning of this?!

36:11.202 --> 36:11.827
Answer me...!

36:15.640 --> 36:16.436
Naruto!

36:16.674 --> 36:18.039
Why are you here?!

36:20.645 --> 36:22.112
You're from the Sand...

36:22.580 --> 36:23.672
Well, that's fine.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.381
You may have thought
that you could sneak up on us,

36:26.417 --> 36:27.714
but don't underestimate

36:27.752 --> 36:30.220
the Five Great Nations' Ninjas
of the Hidden Sand.

36:30.321 --> 36:32.721
What in the world happened?!

36:33.591 --> 36:35.559
Don't you know anything?

36:36.227 --> 36:39.287
These people invaded
the Land of Wind out of nowhere.

36:39.330 --> 36:40.422
What?!

36:41.265 --> 36:44.530
We've had quite a few casualties
trying to stop them.

36:45.069 --> 36:48.163
There are villages that were
caught in the battle and destroyed.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.937
Hey! Is that true?!

36:52.543 --> 36:54.602
They are noble sacrifices
to accomplish our goal.

36:55.046 --> 36:59.380
You bastard! What you're saying
is different from what you're doing!

36:59.417 --> 37:02.614
Sorry for butting in,
but I'm going to take him out now.

37:02.653 --> 37:05.645
Don't interfere!
He's my opponent!

37:05.690 --> 37:06.452
What?!

37:09.860 --> 37:12.488
Those who interfere...
must be eliminated!

37:15.266 --> 37:16.665
Bring it on!

37:19.704 --> 37:22.969
You idiot,
what are you doing here?

37:23.774 --> 37:26.242
Your primary duty is to scout.

37:26.277 --> 37:27.938
This guy's a lookout.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.407
There's another unit waiting nearby.

37:30.881 --> 37:31.779
But...!

37:31.816 --> 37:33.681
Why are you getting worked up?

37:33.884 --> 37:36.375
We're leaving before
this becomes troublesome.

37:45.896 --> 37:47.124
You're not getting away!

37:47.231 --> 37:48.721
You're late as usual.

37:49.834 --> 37:51.995
Oh well, I'll play with them.

37:52.370 --> 37:54.497
Persistent ones make things
worse for themselves.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.867
You... what in the world
are you thinking?

38:00.444 --> 38:02.207
I already told you.

38:02.246 --> 38:07.616
Proportionate sacrifices must be made
in order to achieve a large goal.

38:07.718 --> 38:08.742
What?!

38:09.487 --> 38:11.478
Weren't they your friends?!

38:12.690 --> 38:13.748
They were.

38:14.225 --> 38:16.125
And, from the bottom of their hearts,

38:16.160 --> 38:18.355
they're giving their all for
our dream of a utopia.

38:18.496 --> 38:19.485
No way!

38:19.563 --> 38:22.293
What do you mean, "friends"?! How can
you say it with such indifference!

38:31.776 --> 38:33.368
You're good at dodging.

38:41.118 --> 38:44.918
If all you can do is make it dark,
you're not much of a showman.

38:53.698 --> 38:55.632
<i>These are people who</i>
<i>rebelled against us.</i>

38:55.666 --> 38:59.397
<i>They are regretting their mistakes</i>
<i>as criminals in the Land of Death.</i>

38:59.637 --> 39:02.128
<i>She's... a Genjutsu-user....</i>

39:02.306 --> 39:07.175
<i>The power of time will make you</i>
<i>suffer in eternity.</i>

39:18.356 --> 39:20.586
It'll be too late to cry to me afterwards.

39:20.891 --> 39:23.792
That's enough talk.
Bring it on now.

39:31.635 --> 39:33.899
Tornado Lightning!

39:54.125 --> 39:55.456
Sand Shower!

40:15.012 --> 40:17.776
What's wrong?
Entertain me more!

40:51.215 --> 40:52.739
Go on to the next world...

41:04.328 --> 41:06.762
Thunder Saber!

41:18.542 --> 41:19.770
That was easy...

41:29.053 --> 41:31.146
Sand Burial.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.485
It's useless to struggle...

41:55.446 --> 41:57.107
So that's how you fight...

42:00.084 --> 42:02.814
Geez. You're a difficult opponent.

42:14.632 --> 42:16.293
This isn't over yet.

42:16.467 --> 42:18.594
So you've got the ability
to increase your power

42:18.636 --> 42:20.536
by changing your physical body...

42:23.107 --> 42:24.506
That's right.

42:27.978 --> 42:29.741
This is over.

42:30.247 --> 42:31.339
Here I go!

42:34.919 --> 42:38.753
It's useless.
That won't work against this Plasma Ball!

42:39.490 --> 42:40.684
Take this!

42:51.669 --> 42:53.227
How pathetic.

42:55.639 --> 42:57.368
I got him...

43:01.378 --> 43:03.642
Is this the first time
you've fought a Shinobi?

43:03.948 --> 43:04.812
Wha...?

43:06.083 --> 43:07.641
You're still alive?!

43:11.822 --> 43:13.449
Sand Tsunami!

43:39.550 --> 43:43.418
Your sand doesn't work
against my electric attacks!

43:46.690 --> 43:48.624
<i>If</i> you have your electric attacks...

43:48.726 --> 43:50.990
You can't defeat me!

43:51.328 --> 43:52.420
Sand Lightning Rod.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.410
Giant Sand Burial!

44:26.463 --> 44:27.361
How terrible!

44:31.835 --> 44:33.462
So this is where you were.

44:36.907 --> 44:38.431
I'm not letting you get away.

44:38.976 --> 44:41.536
I told you that persistent ones
only make it worse for themselves.

44:46.283 --> 44:47.614
What's that?

44:49.853 --> 44:51.320
That's pretty dirty!

44:52.890 --> 44:55.017
Crap! Wait, you bitch!

45:00.397 --> 45:01.227
What's this?!

45:02.032 --> 45:03.397
Temujin, withdraw!

45:06.136 --> 45:07.467
I won't let you!

45:08.839 --> 45:10.568
I won't let you get away!

45:10.607 --> 45:12.074
Hey, you idiot! Let me go!

45:12.109 --> 45:14.600
I'm not going to!

45:15.913 --> 45:16.777
Huh?

45:17.981 --> 45:19.573
I... can't hold on...

45:19.616 --> 45:20.344
Huh?

45:21.385 --> 45:24.252
What are you doing here?!

45:24.922 --> 45:27.049
Crap!

45:41.505 --> 45:42.995
Where are the Gelel stones?!

45:43.407 --> 45:45.967
Come now,
I wouldn't know about that.

45:46.009 --> 45:47.533
Are you playing dumb?

45:53.917 --> 45:56.647
Wh-What?

46:01.725 --> 46:03.386
Shadow Possession complete...

46:10.134 --> 46:11.624
Grandpa, are you all right?

46:13.937 --> 46:16.497
We saw a pretty flashy signal flare...

46:17.040 --> 46:17.972
New enemies?

46:18.308 --> 46:21.243
Whoa. Your henchmen won't come
even if you call them.

46:22.179 --> 46:24.977
They're just big and useless.

46:28.385 --> 46:29.409
Wh-What?!

46:51.275 --> 46:53.470
What was that? A wolf?

46:55.579 --> 46:56.477
Get ahold of yourself.

46:58.282 --> 46:59.647
Thank you...

47:01.819 --> 47:03.116
Say, Gramps...

47:03.320 --> 47:05.652
What is this "Stone of Gelel"?

47:05.722 --> 47:07.019
Huh? Gelel?

47:09.660 --> 47:12.185
Well, it's none of our concern...

47:12.629 --> 47:17.032
I was just curious since I heard
the same term used in their stronghold.

47:17.167 --> 47:20.796
Then does that mean
that it's connected to their goal?

47:21.538 --> 47:23.699
Or it could be exactly
what they're after...

47:24.408 --> 47:28.105
Well, it doesn't matter
if you don't want to tell us.

47:29.379 --> 47:31.711
We've got to look for a friend...

47:32.749 --> 47:33.841
Let's go, Sakura!

47:35.018 --> 47:35.916
But...

47:42.025 --> 47:45.654
Wait! Are you friends of Naruto?

47:46.563 --> 47:49.157
Grandpa, do you know Naruto?

47:49.933 --> 47:52.527
Please, help me...

47:52.569 --> 47:55.936
At this rate,
something terrifying is going to happen...

47:56.506 --> 47:57.632
Something terrifying?

48:07.451 --> 48:08.850
<i>What do you mean, "friends"?!</i>

48:08.886 --> 48:10.410
What do you know about me?

48:13.790 --> 48:17.317
What'll we do, Temujin?
Everyone's dead...

48:18.395 --> 48:19.521
Don't cry...

48:20.163 --> 48:21.061
But...

48:22.666 --> 48:24.065
This is dreadful...

48:29.539 --> 48:32.599
You're the only survivors of this village.

48:35.045 --> 48:39.448
This sort of misfortune
wouldn't happen in utopia.

48:40.984 --> 48:42.076
Utopia?

48:43.220 --> 48:47.281
It is the war-free world
I am trying to create.

48:52.262 --> 48:53.229
Isn't it wonderful?

48:54.031 --> 48:56.966
If I can only gather
a lot of these Gelel Stones...

48:57.067 --> 49:01.333
I can rid this world of all wars...

49:02.472 --> 49:04.940
Unsightly and sorrowful wars...

49:11.148 --> 49:12.979
It's amazing that
you can adapt yourself

49:13.016 --> 49:14.574
to the Stones of Gelel.

49:15.285 --> 49:16.252
You think so?

49:16.453 --> 49:20.446
It is. Temujin, I'm proud of you.

49:21.258 --> 49:22.316
Thank you.

49:23.694 --> 49:25.491
I'm not like you.

49:25.529 --> 49:28.123
I only have power
when I go in here.

49:28.732 --> 49:32.759
But our hearts are one.
After all, we're friends.

49:35.005 --> 49:37.735
We mustn't let other villages
become like ours.

49:38.608 --> 49:39.802
Let's give it our best...

49:40.177 --> 49:42.111
For our utopia...

49:50.220 --> 49:51.016
What's wrong?

49:51.054 --> 49:52.453
<i>You blind bastard!</i>

49:52.489 --> 49:56.789
<i>That caravan you stopped by</i>
<i>had information on the Gelel Stones!</i>

49:57.194 --> 49:57.990
What?!

50:00.330 --> 50:02.389
So the lead got away...

50:03.600 --> 50:05.465
I had Temujin go after them.

50:06.336 --> 50:12.241
I see. There was never a time
he didn't live up to my expectations.

50:13.210 --> 50:15.735
That's because
Temujin has that power.

50:45.409 --> 50:47.377
Hey! We've been waiting for you.

50:49.946 --> 50:51.106
You bastard!

50:51.648 --> 50:53.946
Do you know what you did?!

50:54.351 --> 50:56.216
I have nothing to say to you...

50:56.319 --> 50:57.217
What?!

50:57.320 --> 50:59.254
Now hold on, Naruto...

50:59.656 --> 51:02.147
Let me talk to him for a bit.

51:03.326 --> 51:06.693
I didn't expect you to
have information on the stones...

51:06.930 --> 51:10.957
So, why do you want
the Stone of Gelel now?

51:11.368 --> 51:12.995
Because they're important.

51:13.203 --> 51:16.434
You don't know
the horror of those stones.

51:16.673 --> 51:19.972
We mustn't bring them back.

51:20.377 --> 51:22.106
Are you lecturing me?

51:27.317 --> 51:28.909
I thought so...

51:29.653 --> 51:30.711
What is that?

51:31.288 --> 51:36.157
This is a Crystal of Gelel,
the source of life energy.

51:36.626 --> 51:38.958
I know more about
the stones than anyone.

51:39.663 --> 51:42.154
I can see where
you got your recovery powers.

51:42.399 --> 51:44.765
Where did you get that stone?

51:44.968 --> 51:47.732
I received it from my lord,
Master Haido.

51:48.071 --> 51:51.973
I see...
Is the stone only thing you have?

51:53.076 --> 51:54.907
That's odd.

51:55.011 --> 51:58.572
If you're the descendant of
our clan members who crossed the sea,

51:58.682 --> 52:01.207
why don't you know that?

52:01.451 --> 52:03.749
Was the Book of Gelel lost?

52:04.688 --> 52:06.349
What in the world
are you talking about?

52:06.890 --> 52:11.350
From ages past, the only ones
who could fuse their physical bodies

52:11.394 --> 52:16.263
with the Gelel Stones were
the royal family of our clan...

52:16.500 --> 52:20.334
Naruto, I told you a little about it, didn't I?

52:20.637 --> 52:25.700
I told you that when we lost our country,
some of us crossed the sea.

52:26.243 --> 52:27.574
Come to think of it...

52:28.345 --> 52:29.437
According to legend,

52:29.479 --> 52:32.880
it was the royal family of
our clan who crossed the sea.

52:33.016 --> 52:34.210
They took with them

52:34.251 --> 52:37.550
the last Stone of Gelel
and the Book of Gelel.

52:38.488 --> 52:40.388
You said your name was Temujin, right?

52:42.092 --> 52:45.858
You haven't come.
You've returned!

52:46.496 --> 52:49.988
We are of the same clan.

52:50.600 --> 52:53.501
No one knows how
that stone was created.

52:53.537 --> 52:58.873
But it seems that, long ago,
the mysterious Mine was found.

52:59.242 --> 53:03.611
Our ancestors refined that stone,
crystallized it,

53:03.647 --> 53:06.616
and named the mineral "Gelel."

53:07.017 --> 53:10.646
And we created an empire
on this continent

53:10.687 --> 53:13.383
that was founded on the Gelel Stones.

53:13.890 --> 53:19.419
We built wells that didn't dry,
livestock that grew overnight,

53:19.462 --> 53:22.090
trees that continuously bore fruit.

53:22.199 --> 53:27.102
And we even tried to find ways
to stop living things from aging.

53:27.370 --> 53:28.735
That's the first I heard of that.

53:29.206 --> 53:31.401
It was a long time ago.

53:32.175 --> 53:36.339
But often,
great power brings catastrophe.

53:36.980 --> 53:41.314
People fought and quarreled disgracefully
for the power of the Gelel Stones.

53:41.518 --> 53:46.820
In the end, war was waged
with the stones' power.

53:47.290 --> 53:55.561
Mountains and the earth split and,
finally, the battle obliterated the empire.

53:55.799 --> 53:56.823
That's horrible...

53:57.367 --> 54:01.303
Only a handful of young people survived.

54:02.005 --> 54:06.066
Our ancestors sealed the Stone of Gelel
mineral deep underground

54:06.109 --> 54:09.806
and vowed never to
revive the stones ever again.

54:10.247 --> 54:13.705
Why didn't you try to rid yourselves
of such a terrifying thing?

54:14.251 --> 54:18.620
Only the blood of the royal family
can destroy the stones.

54:18.822 --> 54:21.814
We've lost the royal family,

54:21.858 --> 54:26.295
so all we can do is watch over
the stones through the generations.

54:27.330 --> 54:33.291
The legends were supposed
to fade and be lost, but...

54:33.637 --> 54:37.164
Fade? Destroy? Never.

54:37.674 --> 54:39.608
Hearing that, I made up my mind.

54:40.143 --> 54:42.577
I'm going to get those stones,
no matter what.

54:43.046 --> 54:45.537
You bastard... Weren't you listening?!

54:46.283 --> 54:50.811
Power is only power.
What matters is who uses it.

54:51.488 --> 54:54.389
It's a power that is beyond
what humans can handle.

54:54.924 --> 54:56.983
You mustn't revive the stones!

54:57.494 --> 55:01.225
Whatever power it may be,
Master Haido will use it in the right way.

55:03.133 --> 55:05.897
Master Haido said,
"Wars only breed misfortune.

55:05.935 --> 55:12.465
"But wars can't be stopped
without someone standing at the top."

55:13.877 --> 55:16.368
The truth of those words
deeply touched my heart.

55:18.682 --> 55:20.513
In the confusion of war,

55:20.550 --> 55:23.110
my village was attacked
by a gang of thieves.

55:24.587 --> 55:29.388
We survivors were orphaned and
Master Haido adopted us.

55:30.293 --> 55:34.559
I want to grant Master Haido
his wish to free the world of wars.

55:35.198 --> 55:37.166
My friends all think the same.

55:37.300 --> 55:39.734
No matter what the sacrifice...

55:40.136 --> 55:43.731
this is my dream and I need
the Stone of Gelel to achieve it!

55:48.778 --> 55:50.837
He was faking it
from the beginning!

55:50.980 --> 55:51.878
You bastard...

55:52.515 --> 55:56.212
Now... Tell me where
the Mine of Gelel is.

55:56.753 --> 55:57.845
I refuse...

55:58.254 --> 55:59.448
Oh well.

56:02.659 --> 56:03.523
My eyes!

56:11.034 --> 56:13.229
Crap! What was that?

56:13.570 --> 56:15.060
Quickly, let's go after him!

56:15.372 --> 56:19.365
Emina, where is the Gelel Stone Mine?

56:20.243 --> 56:23.542
Sorry. Only Grandpa knows where it is...

56:24.080 --> 56:26.480
If only we had a Ninja Hound...

56:30.820 --> 56:31.752
You...

57:14.330 --> 57:15.388
So this is it...

57:26.476 --> 57:29.070
Sorry for treating you roughly...

57:31.214 --> 57:32.374
Now, go!

58:18.928 --> 58:19.952
How is it?

58:20.363 --> 58:21.352
Everything is ready.

58:21.698 --> 58:22.460
Good.

58:23.299 --> 58:25.096
Then let's move out.

58:58.034 --> 59:01.128
Where's he running? I can't tell!

59:01.337 --> 59:03.328
Right now, he's our only hope!

59:05.808 --> 59:06.706
Is that an exit?!

59:11.814 --> 59:13.645
Naruto! Do something!

59:24.827 --> 59:25.691
That way!

59:36.406 --> 59:39.068
You should know. Show me the way!

59:39.842 --> 59:40.968
This way...

59:43.713 --> 59:44.372
Wait!

59:47.550 --> 59:49.017
Let go of Gramps!

59:50.286 --> 59:51.014
You're in the way!

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:04.062
Wh-What is that?

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:16.936
Master Haido...

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:19.447
The Mine of Gelel is down here.

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:21.113
Thank you, Temujin.

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:23.452
I've put you through
so much trouble.

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:26.650
Thanks to you,
our utopia is right before our eyes.

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:27.619
Yes!

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:30.821
Everyone, let us go.

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:32.185
Hold on a second!

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:39.901
Sorry, but I have some things
I want to ask you.

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:41.594
Master Haido!

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:43.829
It's all right, Kamira.

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:52.440
Hmm... How troublesome.
Is this rude person your friend, Naruto?

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:59.412
What are you doing?
We made a promise.

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:04.157
That we would both try our best
to make a better world.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:07.926
I'm the one who wants
to know what you're doing!

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:12.423
What do you plan to do
once you get the Stone of Gelel?

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:16.668
What will I do?
I'm going to create a utopia.

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:21.642
A world without wars
where the weak aren't oppressed.

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:26.675
I wonder. You look like you're doing
the complete opposite of that.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:30.686
It is all in the name of true justice.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.321
Then why did you attack
a defenseless village and caravan?

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:39.788
I had no choice.
We've made great sacrifices too.

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:44.458
These are all noble sacrifices
to make a world without wars.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:45.827
Hey! Old man!

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:50.072
What are those "noble sacrifices"?

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:56.635
Do you sum them up
as "noble sacrifices"

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:59.806
even if it's your friends
who have fallen?

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:03.544
That's what it means
to accomplish something.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.419
You, too. Are you okay with
your friend being treated like that?!

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:09.892
That's right.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:13.259
That's what everyone has decided,
including me.

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:15.491
It can't be helped.

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:20.998
As friends, we share the dream
of a peaceful utopia.

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:23.161
Then you're no friend!

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:25.402
Why?

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.972
I don't know for sure...

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:34.640
But, to me, a friend is someone
you should cherish more!

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:39.344
I was always alone...

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:44.048
But I made friends and
was no longer alone.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.888
That's why my dream
is to become a Hokage

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:50.956
who protects everyone in my village,
where my friends are!

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:56.235
Who is your utopia for?!

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:59.207
Any dream that doesn't cherish friends
is good for nothing!

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:02.070
I'll crush it!

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:08.412
Wha...?!

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:10.783
What are you doing?!

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:15.483
That thing should be eliminated
from this world...

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.386
Along with us!

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.451
Gramps!

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:30.901
Eliminate the stone?!

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.200
There is no way...

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:40.014
What does he know?!

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:55.453
Hurry! We are going after them!

01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:57.696
Master Haido! To the stronghold!

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.358
There's not enough time!
Bring the stronghold with you!

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:08.740
Wait!

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:13.347
I'll deal with you, boy!

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.015
What nerve!

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:20.980
Naruto, go!

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:23.415
Crap...

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:28.524
Hold it!

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:50.316
Where are we?

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:53.917
According to legend,
this is the Chamber of Sealing.

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:57.753
Everything is as the legend says.

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:02.691
It's the first time I've come here,
but it feels kind of familiar...

01:05:06.702 --> 01:05:11.469
These were written by our ancestors
when they sealed away this place.

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:15.409
It tells of the terrible power
of the Gelel Stones.

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:17.104
What's this?

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:20.543
It seems to be a depiction of despair.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:26.316
The empire was probably obliterated,
just like in that picture...

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:29.485
How promising! It would have been
meaningless if we came this far

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:31.686
only to find the power of Gelel
wasn't what we expected.

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:34.992
Don't you think that this is terrifying?!

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:36.658
This tremendous picture proves

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:40.795
that this great power can
only breed destruction...

01:05:41.504 --> 01:05:44.268
People will fight with or
without the power of Gelel.

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:48.340
We just have to use it
in the right way.

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:50.612
I see...

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:55.608
The Stone of Gelel is further down,
but our journey...

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:56.911
ends here!

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:02.614
Little girl, you'll die if you interfere!

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:19.167
Come on, what's wrong, boy?
Entertain me more!

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:22.905
Where are the shadow techniques
you're good at?

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:27.642
Crap! She keeps flying around...

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:31.145
What should I do? Think!

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:41.320
How's that?!

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:43.762
Little girl!

01:06:44.533 --> 01:06:47.366
I blinded her.
How is she chasing me?

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:51.832
The smell of your blood
tells me where you are.

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:03.812
It's useless to hide...

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:10.492
Little girl... There you are!

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.991
Farewell!

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:29.475
Damn it! Little girl!

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.396
You think that you've caught me?

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:01.372
Whoa! You shouldn't move!

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:09.907
Oh, an escape opening...

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:13.844
Just kidding.

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:17.154
Your shadow is waiting there, isn't it?

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.890
So many holes.

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:26.557
Your shadow can't reach me from here.

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:28.894
Adios...

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.332
Hey, let me out! Let me out!

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:40.210
Secret Black Move Iron Maiden 2.

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.218
It's just as I planned, I suppose.

01:08:49.457 --> 01:08:50.618
You saved me.

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:53.323
I had a score to settle with her.

01:08:55.363 --> 01:08:58.856
That aside, we can't move recklessly
with all these paper bombs around.

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:02.868
Oh... Most of these are
just regular pieces of paper.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:04.803
Really?

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:09.600
How foolish.

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:12.477
Did you think that you could defeat me
with a surprise attack?

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.709
It's probably impossible...

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:19.484
But I've achieved my goal.

01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:20.447
What?

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:23.991
Do you know what
the design on this floor is?

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:31.263
It's an ancient Summoning Jutsu formula
to summon a certain something.

01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:32.595
What are you thinking?

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:37.962
Now be destroyed with me!

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:48.910
I don't know what
he was trying to do...

01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:51.376
But it seems that I made it just in time.

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:52.884
Master Haido...

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.355
Are you all right, Temujin?

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.460
Master Haido, that just now...

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:00.556
Oh...

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:05.056
It was thanks to this.

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:10.436
That's... a Stone of Gelel!

01:10:12.608 --> 01:10:14.098
It's just like in the book.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.174
What amazing power.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.305
I can blow things away
without touching them.

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:22.710
Do you mean the Book of Gelel?!

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:23.950
Excuse me?

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.512
Where did you get that?!

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:29.087
Oh, it's not what you think...

01:10:29.124 --> 01:10:31.718
I bought it from
a wandering salesman.

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:36.056
That's impossible!
I thought it was strange.

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:39.898
You destroyed Temujin's village
to get the Stone of Gelel...

01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:45.806
Now why do you doubt me?

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:49.368
My goal is a world without wars.

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.504
How could you say
such a terrifying thing?

01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:56.611
Those who truly want peace
wouldn't want the power of Gelel!

01:10:56.719 --> 01:11:00.348
I want the power to stop all wars.

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:02.619
That is all.

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:06.420
Umm... The location of
the Mine is...

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:10.529
I can tell by looking at your eyes!
You're rotten at heart!

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:14.461
Hmm... I don't really know where it is...

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:17.967
Oh... What's this?

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:26.875
This is... the key to open
the door to the Mine.

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:30.282
Oh no! That's not for you!

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.486
Nerugui!

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:42.122
Oh... Nerugui!

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:47.795
Oh? There was a pebble of Gelel
in its mouth.

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:52.264
The poor thing.
Another noble sacrifice.

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:57.938
Honestly. Those who stand on top
have to make such tough decisions.

01:11:58.347 --> 01:12:00.406
I've had enough of your empty words!

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:03.049
Oh, how troublesome.

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:06.814
There's going to be
another noble sacrifice...

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:15.196
I can't control my power very well yet...

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:18.630
Well, that's fine...

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:26.341
What are you doing, Temujin?

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.709
I'm very sorry, but...

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:32.680
The Mine of Gelel is already ours.

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:35.845
We can just ignore this helpless old man...

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:38.216
That is not what I'm asking.

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:42.720
Do not stand in front of my target.

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:49.955
Master Haido?

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:53.424
You're in the way there.

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:57.768
What are you bastards doing?!

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.472
Aren't you persistent...

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:13.313
Temujin!

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:17.416
Why are you just standing there?
Kill them!

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.064
What's this?

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:31.436
Is this... a noble sacrifice?

01:13:32.274 --> 01:13:35.573
What's wrong?
Take care of them like you always do.

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:38.105
Now, quickly!

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:41.513
That's... enough, isn't it?

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:43.610
I...

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:48.922
Temujin, I'm disappointed in you.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:54.787
You're also an inferior person,
like your parents.

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:06.597
- What a pitiful kid.
- What a pitiful kid.

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:11.205
That's impossible!

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:20.585
That's right, it's me!

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:24.191
I must say, you didn't even know
that I killed your parents...

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:28.287
and you became so attached to me.
What a cute pawn.

01:14:29.164 --> 01:14:32.224
However... now that I know
where the stones are...

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:34.966
I no longer need you!

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:48.606
Master... Haido.

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:51.281
Die, you good for nothing!

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.753
Stop!

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:56.558
Temujin!

01:15:01.263 --> 01:15:04.699
Now the world is mine!

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:12.364
Temujin!

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:14.102
Naruto!

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:18.875
Please, stop him...!

01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:24.911
You piece of trash...

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:38.591
I won't let you go any further!

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:41.700
First trash, now rubbish...

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:52.011
Shadow Clone!

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:56.380
<i>I....</i>

01:15:58.420 --> 01:15:59.978
<i>We....</i>

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.364
<i>Why in the world....</i>

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:14.962
<i>have we....</i>

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:24.902
- Multi...!
- Too slow!

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.686
Why don't you give up already?

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:39.858
No... way...

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:54.798
H-Hey you...

01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:58.609
Are you... going to give up here?!

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.840
Wasn't your dream...
to make a utopia?!

01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:12.426
Rasengan!

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:28.876
I did it...

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:34.540
<i>Where does he... get that strength?</i>

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:53.995
Well... that hurt a little bit.

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:56.061
What?!

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:00.664
This is...

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.079
wonderful!

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:08.813
It's the Mine of Gelel!

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.819
My wounds are healing!

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:17.925
What power!

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:22.563
Temujin! Lend me a hand!

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.625
I can't defeat him by myself!

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.369
You... still?

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:33.501
I won't give up. Now, help me!

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:38.539
What are you blabbing about?

01:18:39.414 --> 01:18:41.974
Go to utopia already.

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:47.551
- Naruto!
- Temujin!

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:18.083
Everyone...

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:19.784
What...

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:22.717
have I done?

01:19:27.162 --> 01:19:28.993
What foolish children.

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:31.929
I thought I ordered them
not to interfere.

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.662
Perhaps they're at a rebellious age.

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:35.898
Well, no matter.

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:38.598
This is beginning to bore me.

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:39.906
Temujin!

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:52.316
Damn it!

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:57.222
I...

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.092
I...!

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:00.828
Let's go, Temujin!

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:23.944
This is it. Go meet your ancestors!

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:28.711
Temujin...

01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:33.121
<i>Naruto... you were right.</i>

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:36.793
<i>Dreams that sacrifice friends</i>
<i>should never come to fruition!</i>

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.127
Humph! Your deaths are long overdue.

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:50.503
How impudent!

01:20:57.219 --> 01:20:59.949
You can't even touch me!

01:21:04.626 --> 01:21:06.821
Die already!

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.188
Take this...!

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:14.465
This is for Temujin!

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:17.004
That won't work!

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.469
Oh no!

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:12.956
This is terrible?!

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:18.767
The Mine of Gelel,
the source of life!

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:21.895
Hey, Gramps!
What in the world is going on?!

01:22:22.737 --> 01:22:27.140
The seal was broken when
the key to the Mine was destroyed!

01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:29.576
What's happening?!

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:34.171
The Mine of Gelel is going wild...

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:46.189
How are they?

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:48.822
They're breathing...

01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:51.655
But they're not regaining consciousness.

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:53.366
I see...

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:58.695
What's going on?!

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:02.372
Damn it! I hope nothing troublesome
is happening.

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:09.639
What happens when it goes wild?!

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:14.048
I don't know! But considering
the scale of the ancient empire...

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:17.422
it wouldn't be any wonder
if half this continent blew up!

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:18.323
What?!

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:20.256
How can we stop it?!

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:24.060
Unfortunately, there is no way.

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:27.762
What were you trying to do earlier?
You know some way.

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:30.027
What was that Jutsu formula?!

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:33.800
There isn't a way to stop it
from going out of control.

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:37.641
But there is a way
to destroy the Mine.

01:23:37.779 --> 01:23:38.643
Tell me!

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:43.814
This is a special
Summoning Jutsu formula!

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:47.751
It is bound by royal blood.
Place your hand at the center!

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:49.924
What are you going to summon?

01:23:50.425 --> 01:23:52.086
A Space-Time Rift.

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:53.819
A Space-Time Rift?

01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:57.397
A vast empty space that
will swallow up everything.

01:23:57.499 --> 01:24:00.161
It will appear at the center
of the Jutsu formula.

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:01.259
Therefore...

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:05.636
The person who activates
the Jutsu won't come back alive.

01:24:07.809 --> 01:24:09.208
So that's it...

01:24:09.944 --> 01:24:12.071
Gramps! What do you mean
"won't come back alive"?

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:16.108
Naruto!

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:19.115
This will be my way of
atoning for what I've done.

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:22.748
You!

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.519
Take care of everyone!

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.013
Temujin!

01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:02.053
How many more of them are there?

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:05.026
Just a few more.

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:06.390
All right.

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:10.427
<i>Crap! Come back safe, Naruto....</i>

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:48.194
No way...

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:23.495
<i>Come here....</i>

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:26.529
That's enough...

01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:37.108
Temujin, hold on tight!

01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:39.719
What are you, stupid?! You'll die!

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:42.386
Shut up! Be quiet!

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.391
That's enough. Let go!
You're going to get pulled in!

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:58.297
It's not enough! It won't be
any good if you die like this!

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:03.137
I don't want to lose
any more friends!

01:28:15.423 --> 01:28:17.288
Naruto? Where's Naruto?!

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:19.423
Is he still over there...?!

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.720
Oh! Wait, Sakura!

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.029
Crap!

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:40.337
Naruto!

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:42.243
Where are you?

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:43.708
Naruto!

01:28:58.766 --> 01:28:59.698
What is this?!

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:23.847
What in the world's going on?!

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:27.457
Geez, it's even stronger
than the legend says.

01:29:27.495 --> 01:29:28.291
Gramps!

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:37.335
Are you all right?!

01:29:37.972 --> 01:29:44.172
I was tossed and crushed.
I was sure that my time had come...

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:46.212
Gramps, what's happened?

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:49.376
Life has budded in this wasteland.

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:53.050
This is what happened when just
a little of the Mine's power seeped out

01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:55.055
as it was being destroyed.

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:58.321
Thanks to its power,
I'm totally healed!

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:02.094
Oh... Nerugui.

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:12.930
What is this?

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:13.969
Oh!

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:26.785
Temujin...

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:40.632
Where... is this place?

01:30:43.538 --> 01:30:44.869
I'm alive?

01:30:57.452 --> 01:31:00.785
I see... These ruins...

01:31:17.438 --> 01:31:18.336
This is...

01:31:22.643 --> 01:31:24.577
So it wasn't a picture of despair.

01:32:16.164 --> 01:32:21.033
Temujin's part of your clan.
He should have stayed here.

01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:23.501
He's headed to war...

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.232
It can't be helped.
It's the path he decided upon.

Our bond was cut
a long time ago.

01:32:31.947 --> 01:32:32.381
<i>It is very painful to try and feel the things,</i>

01:32:32.381 --> 01:32:37.052
<i>It is very painful to try and feel the things,</i>
His soul is no longer tied
to this continent.

01:32:37.052 --> 01:32:37.486
<i>It is very painful to try and feel the things,</i>

01:32:37.486 --> 01:32:38.754
<i>It is very painful to try and feel the things,</i>
It'll be tough...

01:32:38.754 --> 01:32:39.015
<i>It is very painful to try and feel the things,</i>

01:32:39.354 --> 01:32:39.988
But he's not alone.

<i>of which we used to not see, or know about.</i>
But he's not alone.

01:32:41.022 --> 01:32:41.423
<i>of which we used to not see, or know about.</i>

01:32:41.423 --> 01:32:43.592
<i>of which we used to not see, or know about.</i>
He said this time

01:32:43.592 --> 01:32:43.625
<i>of which we used to not see, or know about.</i>

01:32:43.625 --> 01:32:49.264

he and his friends will really strive to
make a world without wars.

01:32:49.264 --> 01:32:49.730

01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:52.801
<i>It's not just you that wants</i>

Grandpa?

01:32:52.801 --> 01:32:56.872
<i>It's not just you that wants</i>
<i>to start crying and run away.</i>

01:32:56.872 --> 01:33:00.709
<i>It's not just you that wants</i>
<i>to start crying and run away.</i>
It's hopeless. I've been rejected.

01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:04.645
<i>It's not just you that wants</i>
<i>to start crying and run away.</i>

01:33:04.713 --> 01:33:11.619
<i>It's the same for me too.</i>

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:13.722
<i>There are no such things as</i>

01:33:13.722 --> 01:33:18.860

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:23.194
<i>So harden your fist</i>

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:33.642
Come to think of it,
where's Naruto?

01:33:33.642 --> 01:33:34.109
<i>Even this flower that cannot be reached,</i>

01:33:34.142 --> 01:33:37.446
<i>Even this flower that cannot be reached,</i>

Well, I've looked for him,
but he isn't around.

01:33:37.446 --> 01:33:44.079
<i>Even this flower that cannot be reached,</i>
<i>no matter how hard you reach for....</i>

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:54.250
<i>We can easily grab it</i>

01:33:55.163 --> 01:34:05.562
<i>We grow far apart,</i>
<i>or misunderstand each other,</i>

01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:16.281
<i>And even fight each other</i>
<i>to believe in something.</i>

01:34:16.718 --> 01:34:20.779
<i>Even if the present hurts us</i>
<i>and drench ourselves in tears,</i>

01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:27.394
<i>Let's go together towards our future.</i>
<i>Ding! Dong! Dang!</i>

01:34:54.523 --> 01:35:04.797
<i>Even if we graduate,</i>
<i>or grow up as an adult,</i>

01:35:05.333 --> 01:35:15.402
<i>You be yourself, and I'll be myself.</i>

01:35:16.044 --> 01:35:26.147
<i>The sky above is never-ending.</i>

01:35:26.988 --> 01:35:36.989
<i>There is not a single thing that covers it</i>

01:35:37.666 --> 01:35:39.401
<i>There are no such things</i>
