00:01.560 --> 00:04.222
Woman:
"I, Ernest Charles Bordelon,
of sound mind and body,

00:04.270 --> 00:07.990
dec|a_re that this is
my last Will and testament.

00:10.470 --> 00:14.133
To my dear sister,
Violet Bordelon,

00:14.180 --> 00:16.501
I bequeath 'True North.'"

00:16.550 --> 00:18.506
Charley:
What is that, Aunt Vi?

00:18.550 --> 00:20.142
It's Pop's boat.

00:20.180 --> 00:22.819
Named after Mom.

00:22.850 --> 00:26.581
True is up there
smilin' somewhere.

00:28.320 --> 00:32.199
"To my children, Nova,
Charlotte and Ralph Angel
Bordelon,

00:32.230 --> 00:33.788
I bequeath
800 acres

00:33.830 --> 00:37.698
and all other
real property and
equipment equally.

00:38.670 --> 00:40.831
With each
Bordelon generation,

00:40.870 --> 00:44.499
we work to do
a little better
than the last.

00:44.540 --> 00:48.431
Nova, Charlotte,
Ralph Angel,

00:48.480 --> 00:51.142
you are now
in this line.

00:51.180 --> 00:54.274
Out of every place
in this whole big world,

00:54.320 --> 00:58.245
this land
bears our name.

00:58.290 --> 00:59.712
Farm it...

00:59.760 --> 01:02.354
nurture it,
love it.

01:02.390 --> 01:04.187
Pass it on
to your children

01:04.230 --> 01:07.154
and for every Bordelon
that will come next.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.569
Your forever-loving
father, Ernest."

01:11.600 --> 01:14.433
( music playing )

01:14.470 --> 01:18.463
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the
world turns *

01:18.510 --> 01:22.173
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the
world turns *

01:22.210 --> 01:24.701
* Keep the colors
in the lines-- take flight *

01:26.620 --> 01:29.214
Dreams never die *

01:34.490 --> 01:38.187
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

01:38.230 --> 01:41.097
* Keep the colors
in the lines-- take flight. *

01:42.630 --> 01:46.259
He wants us
to farm the land.

01:46.300 --> 01:49.599
I'll leave y'all some time
to talk amongst yourselves.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.198
Thank you.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.834
Miss Althea, um,
when was that letter
written?

01:53.880 --> 01:57.372
It's dated
October 1989.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.117
He wrote that
right after Ralph Angel
was born.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.650
Pop was all misty-eyed
from having a boy.

02:09.260 --> 02:13.651
It was during
the harvest time, too.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.168
He just never got around
to changin' it.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.363
He'd never expect us
to be tied up to the land now,
now that we're grown.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.595
"Tied up"?

02:21.640 --> 02:23.505
You make it sound
like a burden.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.360
You know what I mean.
We were just kids.

02:25.410 --> 02:27.878
I don't think Daddy
would expect us
to do this now.

02:27.910 --> 02:29.639
He did.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.375
He told me
that's what
he wanted.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.514
- Both: When?
- Last week.

02:33.550 --> 02:35.313
Last month.

02:35.350 --> 02:37.739
All the time.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.655
Oh, so y'all
think I'm lying?

02:39.690 --> 02:42.420
No, but Rah, come on.
None of us knows a thing
about runnin' a farm.

02:42.460 --> 02:45.884
I do. Me and Blue
helped out Pop
all the time.

02:45.930 --> 02:48.626
Running a farm
is a lot of hard work.

02:48.660 --> 02:52.289
Come on!
What's the harm
In tryIn'?

02:52.340 --> 02:54.262
It's too late in the season
to try and ﬁnd a buyer
anyhow.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.530
Actually, a buyer
already approached me.

02:56.570 --> 02:58.265
Sam... Landry?

02:58.310 --> 03:00.198
- Ralph: Oh, hell, no.
- When did he contact you?

03:00.240 --> 03:01.969
He stopped by
a few days before
Daddy's funeral.

03:02.010 --> 03:04.945
Said he was interested
in buying and told me
to call him.

03:04.980 --> 03:07.210
- You coulda told us.
- Well, I'm telling you now.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.945
All right.

03:08.980 --> 03:13.417
Ernest wouldn't
want y'all argum'
and fightin' over this.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.883
Now, the land
is a choice.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.979
If it's not
y'alls' chorce,

03:18.030 --> 03:20.396
then there's no shame
in feelin' that way.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.493
- Well, I want it.
- ( Nova sighs )

03:24.530 --> 03:28.296
For me and Blue
to make a fresh start
of things.

03:28.340 --> 03:31.434
So y'all go on
and get back to your lives
and I'll manage the farm.

03:31.470 --> 03:33.472
- By yourself?
- If I have to.

03:33.510 --> 03:35.239
And with what money?

03:36.710 --> 03:39.247
Look,
I feel you, Rah.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.817
Okay? I do.

03:41.850 --> 03:44.546
But it's too much.

03:44.590 --> 03:46.581
Oh, so that's that,
then?

03:46.620 --> 03:49.589
Hm?
Naw. You said it.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.622
That's not--
That's not what I'm sayin'.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.254
Baby, wait.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.892
Baby.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.605
Baby, wait.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.039
Ralph Angel,
wait up.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.605
Why you ain't have
my back in there,
huh?

04:09.650 --> 04:12.642
- 'Cause I'm not takin' sides.
- You took s_ides.
Just not mine.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.047
All right.
So, how you gonna
take care of 800 acres

04:16.080 --> 04:19.755
when you can barely
take care of yourself
and Blue?

04:19.790 --> 04:21.781
Oh, that's
how you feel.

04:21.820 --> 04:24.687
Ralph Angel, you know
how I feel about you.

04:24.730 --> 04:27.324
I'll see you later,
Aunt V.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.793
Don't be like that.

04:28.830 --> 04:31.025
Thank you Mr. Land--

04:31.070 --> 04:33.994
- Sam, right.
Now you're sure?
- Nova: Rah. Rah!

04:34.040 --> 04:35.769
We haven't decided
anything yet.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.768
We're just tryin'
to figure things out.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.301
No, you decided.
It ain't just me.
That's the point.

04:40.340 --> 04:42.376
- The both of y'all.
- Okay. You know, we can
talk abut this later.

04:42.410 --> 04:45.971
Yeah.
So, I just got off
the phone with Landry.

04:46.010 --> 04:47.910
He wants _to make us
an offer In person.

04:47.950 --> 04:49.713
He said we can come by
any time today.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.479
- Y'all ain't
waste no time.
- Nova: Rah--

04:51.520 --> 04:53.784
If Landry is the only buyer
this late in the season,

04:53.820 --> 04:56.459
we should at least
hear what his offer is.

04:56.490 --> 04:58.048
Should we go now?

04:58.090 --> 04:59.921
I gotta go
pick Blue up
from school.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.894
I'm on a story
this afternoon.
I can go later.

05:01.930 --> 05:04.626
Well, what about later today?
We need to settle this
before I go back.

05:04.670 --> 05:07.696
Fine, I guess I could
come back. It'll have to be
late afternoon, though.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.605
- Ralph Angel?
- Why's it matter?

05:09.640 --> 05:11.460
_ Y'all ain't
listenIn' no way.

05:11.510 --> 05:13.774
* Life is but a game

05:13.810 --> 05:17.439
* Do we simply play now?

05:17.480 --> 05:18.970
( truck engine starts )

05:19.010 --> 05:22.480
I can't wait
for you to get back.
I miss my Micah.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.341
- Hey, I miss you, too.
- ( knocking )

05:25.390 --> 05:26.755
You hungry?

05:26.790 --> 05:29.782
- No.
- Who you talkin' to?

05:29.830 --> 05:32.549
Stella.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.454
Hey, did you
hear from Dad?

05:36.600 --> 05:39.467
He probably
_hasn't arrived
In Houston yet.

05:42.740 --> 05:44.537
( softly)
Okay.

05:44.570 --> 05:46.128
- ( Micah sighs)
- Stella: Who was that?

05:46.170 --> 05:49.674
"Hollywood"?
"Ralph Angel"? "Blue"?

05:49.710 --> 05:52.474
Everybody
in your family's
got a weird name.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.841
( laughing )
I know.

05:54.880 --> 05:58.088
Hey are you, uh--
have you been to my house?

05:58.120 --> 06:00.714
Stella:
It's... crazy.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.627
You can't even
get up your street,
there's so many news vans.

06:03.660 --> 06:05.878
Mm.

06:05.930 --> 06:09.127
Must be
the suspension, huh?

06:09.160 --> 06:11.594
Yeah, I mean,
I guess so.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.139
* Standing now

06:17.170 --> 06:21.732
* Calling all the people here
to see the show *

06:23.450 --> 06:27.511
* Calling for all my demons now
to let me go *

06:29.150 --> 06:33.655
* I need something,
give me something wonderful *

06:39.060 --> 06:41.893
* You can't
take me down *

06:41.930 --> 06:44.728
* You can't
break me down. *

06:44.770 --> 06:48.695
Nova: I'ma keep comin'
as many times as it takes.
Don't you worry about me.

06:48.740 --> 06:51.504
And why'd
they stop you?

06:51.540 --> 06:54.600
Too Sweet:
They wanted to know
why I wasn't in school.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.449
Next thing
I knew,

06:56.480 --> 06:59.005
they got my arm
jacked up and they
checkin' my pockets.

06:59.050 --> 07:00.711
- And what did you do?
- Nothin'!

07:00.750 --> 07:03.514
I told you.

07:03.550 --> 07:06.610
Why I gotta
say I'm guilty for
somethin' I didn't do?

07:06.660 --> 07:09.185
( sighs )

07:12.660 --> 07:15.458
Army be done
and gone.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.661
They ain't gonna take me
with a record.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.465
You're right.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.104
They won't.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.809
( sniffles )

07:29.850 --> 07:32.512
I swear they tryin'
to break me.

07:36.250 --> 07:40.789
Remember, you're not
of this place, Too Sweet.

07:40.820 --> 07:44.028
Put your mind
elsewhere, hear?

07:44.060 --> 07:47.518
Fortify yourself.

07:47.560 --> 07:50.563
- You pray?
- Not no more.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.593
I'll bring you something
to read, okay?

07:57.640 --> 08:00.177
Think you
can hang in there
for a bit longer?

08:03.580 --> 08:04.899
Good.

08:04.950 --> 08:08.169
'Cause breakin'
you down...

08:08.220 --> 08:10.211
that's how they get you
to take a plea

08:10.250 --> 08:13.959
for somethin'
you didn't do.

08:13.990 --> 08:17.824
They scare you
with a mountain of charges.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.219
That's what they do
to us.

08:23.230 --> 08:26.165
They make us
scared to fight.

08:29.570 --> 08:32.676
You seem like a fighter
to me, brother.

08:35.010 --> 08:38.173
You can take this trial
If you want.

08:38.210 --> 08:41.247
You decide, not them.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.748
I didn't do
anything wrong.

08:46.660 --> 08:49.288
Fight, then.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.295
I'll fight with you.

09:05.810 --> 09:07.698
All right.

09:07.740 --> 09:10.004
You sure?

09:10.050 --> 09:12.348
Time.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.917
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- I got you.

09:14.950 --> 09:16.815
Guard:
Let's go.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.627
( sighs )

09:33.070 --> 09:35.891
( faint laughter )

09:40.140 --> 09:42.802
( door closes,
remote chirps )

09:49.150 --> 09:51.687
Mornin', Miss Violet.

09:54.260 --> 09:58.879
I, uh... I stopped by
to see Charley and Micah.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.663
They here?

10:03.930 --> 10:06.797
( men laughing )

10:20.750 --> 10:22.684
How you guys doin'?

10:22.720 --> 10:25.939
Blue's gonna be mad
when he find out he
missed you comin' by.

10:25.990 --> 10:28.959
Well, I got a ball
and some gear in the car
for him.

10:28.990 --> 10:31.151
I just wanna take care
of the little man,
you know?

10:31.190 --> 10:33.750
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.297
- You want some coffee?
- We out.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.439
Sweet tea
in the refrigerator,
though.

10:41.470 --> 10:43.358
Unh-uh.
We outta that, too.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.732
- Okay.
- I'm good, man, thanks.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.372
( door opens )

10:48.410 --> 10:51.675
I didn't realize
you were still here.

10:51.710 --> 10:55.146
I needed
to see you guys
before I head out.

10:55.180 --> 10:57.740
- Cool.
- Yeah.

10:59.790 --> 11:02.725
- Beautiful homegoin'.
- Sure was, it sure was.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.421
It meant a lot
to see you there, bruh.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.280
Thanks.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.665
Davis:
Hey, baby.

11:12.170 --> 11:14.388
What are you
doing here?

11:14.440 --> 11:16.328
I need to talk
to you.

11:16.370 --> 11:18.964
We fly back tomorrow, Davis.
We'll talk then.

11:19.010 --> 11:22.377
But-- uh--
I need to talk to you now,
Charley, in private.

11:22.410 --> 11:24.446
There ain't no need.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.449
All y'all's
business already out
in the street anyhow.

11:30.350 --> 11:33.217
The Houston Police wanna
questIon me, Charley.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.911
- What for?
- Outside.

11:49.070 --> 11:50.401
When do you go?

11:50.440 --> 11:54.137
This afternoon,
but there's something else.

11:54.180 --> 11:58.241
They're gonna announce
that me, Felix and Eddie
are suspended.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.512
- League decision.
- What do they have on you?

12:01.550 --> 12:04.781
Nothing.

12:04.820 --> 12:07.789
Not a damn thing.
Charley, listen,
I didn't rape her, okay?

12:09.860 --> 12:13.956
Me and the boys
went for drinks at Diamonds
after the game that night.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.988
We hired _
an escort serVIce.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.734
A prostitute?

12:29.010 --> 12:31.308
Did you have sex
with her?

12:39.020 --> 12:41.079
Yes.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.348
Once.

12:42.390 --> 12:45.029
Baby,
just one time.

12:45.060 --> 12:47.119
I'm ashamed of it.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.253
I'm ashamed
and I'm sorry.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.359
Baby, I'm--

12:51.400 --> 12:53.391
I'm sorry, Charley,
but that's the truth.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.091
You're only telling me
all this because
you got caught.

13:00.610 --> 13:03.875
- I can't even look at you.
- I made a mistake, okay?

13:03.910 --> 13:06.913
Look, I shouldn't be demonized
for something I didn't do.

13:06.950 --> 13:08.247
I need you,
Charley.

13:08.280 --> 13:12.011
No, Davis,
what you need
is a lavwer.

13:12.050 --> 13:15.417
- When are we going
to Houston?
- We're not.

13:17.260 --> 13:19.353
What do--?
We gotta be there
with Dad.

13:19.390 --> 13:22.154
We've got family business
to settle here before
we go anywhere.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.919
This is
family business, too.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.962
- I'll go
to Houston with him.
- No, you will not.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.332
Oh, so, you're just gonna
let him face this alone?

13:30.370 --> 13:33.908
Yeah, you can stay here.
He can come back with me.

13:38.980 --> 13:40.971
This is ridiculous.

13:44.890 --> 13:48.189
How dare you try to bring
my baby into this?

13:48.220 --> 13:51.018
Micah?
Micah?

13:51.060 --> 13:54.894
- Don't, I'm staying here.
- Micah, wait. Micah!

13:57.130 --> 14:00.065
* Don't look back

14:01.970 --> 14:04.359
* Look ahead

14:07.640 --> 14:10.848
* Don't look back

14:12.380 --> 14:14.974
* Look ahead

14:16.250 --> 14:17.615
* Don't look back...

14:17.650 --> 14:19.584
Ever been
out here before?

14:19.620 --> 14:22.612
To this museum
of our enslaved ancestors?

14:22.660 --> 14:24.321
No.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.954
It's like going back in time.
Just replace black with brown.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.651
Charley:
Can we just stay
focused, please?

14:29.700 --> 14:33.488
If we get into
a negotiation, can we agree
I'll take the lead?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.360
- Why we even comin'?
- Rah.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.937
This is what I do
every day-- negotiate.

14:37.970 --> 14:40.131
If you say
you got this,
you got this.

14:41.240 --> 14:44.243
Welcome, Bordelons.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.976
Thanks for agreeing
to meet us on such
short notice.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.976
Listen,
the pleasure's
all mine.

14:49.020 --> 14:52.911
My wife, Mary, has laid out
a little somethin' for us
around back,

14:52.960 --> 14:55.178
so, let's go have
some refreshments.

14:55.220 --> 14:57.188
Hope you brought
an appetite.

15:03.530 --> 15:05.964
Ralph Angel:
How many acres you farmin'?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.560
Landry:
Oh, I reckon a little more
than 3,000.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.659
We're laying by
on a little more than 750.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.507
Charley:
Laying by?

15:12.540 --> 15:15.930
It means they got
the seed cane
in the ground.

15:15.980 --> 15:20.314
I didn't realize you had
an interest in farmin',
Ralph Angel.

15:20.350 --> 15:24.389
Everything I learned,
I learned from Pops.

15:24.420 --> 15:28.288
Good farmer,
better man.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.424
The government
did somethin' right

15:30.460 --> 15:32.724
by limiting
Mexican sugar imports.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.320
So, the price-per-pound
has come up?

15:35.360 --> 15:39.023
Landry: Well, the American
farmer finally has a chance
to start to compete.

15:39.070 --> 15:41.231
So, you got us
all the way out here.

15:41.270 --> 15:42.669
What's your offer?

15:42.700 --> 15:44.565
Talk about cuttin'
to the chase.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.135
I think it's safe to say
we're all a little anxious.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.307
It's been a difficult
last few days.

15:49.340 --> 15:51.706
I understand.

15:51.750 --> 15:55.516
And again, you all have
my sincerest condolences.

15:55.550 --> 15:58.644
And now, out of respect
for Ernest,

15:58.690 --> 16:01.250
and your family's history
in this parish,

16:01.290 --> 16:03.451
I wanna do right.

16:03.490 --> 16:06.050
I'm offerin' you
850 per acre.

16:06.090 --> 16:09.719
I've run the comps.
It's worth twice as much
as you're offerIng.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.729
We know our daddy's land
is one of the best parcels
in the parish.

16:12.770 --> 16:17.161
The land is well-drained.
It's got good soil pH.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.599
Pops just ran out of money
to plant these last few years,

16:19.640 --> 16:23.076
but his crop yields
have always been high.

16:23.110 --> 16:25.499
Well, clearly,
you know somethin'
about farming.

16:25.550 --> 16:28.519
Then you must also know
how far behind y'all are.

16:28.550 --> 16:31.610
The seed cane shoulda
been in the ground
more than a month ago.

16:31.650 --> 16:34.448
Yes, but the land
is still the land.

16:34.490 --> 16:38.221
We're not gonna
just give it away.

16:38.260 --> 16:40.797
Hear me now.

16:40.830 --> 16:43.094
I'm the only farmer
in this parish

16:43.130 --> 16:47.032
capable of bringin' in
a crop on this land
on time.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.304
Can you give us
a few days to
think about it?

16:51.340 --> 16:54.434
- A week, maybe?
- A week? Mercy.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.539
Try two days.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.674
After that, that land's
not worth anything to me.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.383
Y'all figure it out
amongst yourselves.

17:04.420 --> 17:06.285
You hear
what he just said?

17:19.830 --> 17:22.537
It's basically
two weeks on,
two weeks off.

17:22.570 --> 17:25.232
Mm. Must get lonely
on that rig.

17:25.270 --> 17:28.501
I know I wouldn't
want to sleep with all
that water underneath me.

17:28.540 --> 17:32.146
You know, that's why
I don't ever wanna go
on no kind of cruise.

17:32.180 --> 17:34.410
( laughing )

17:34.450 --> 17:36.577
I like this.
Lemme see.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.747
Your break over yet,
Roberta?

17:38.790 --> 17:41.213
'Cause mine
starts now, baby.

17:42.890 --> 17:45.222
- Hey, you.
- Hey, baby.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.718
Oh, hey, Vi.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.265
Bye, Roberta.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.268
( engine starts )

17:58.340 --> 18:00.479
Violet:
I'll be back, baby.

18:00.510 --> 18:03.399
* Got me rockin'
and reeIIn' *

18:06.610 --> 18:09.716
* Oh, what a feelin'...

18:09.750 --> 18:13.311
Violet: Swole-up feet
is the only thing I'm gonna
have to show for today.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.716
( chuckles )
Them farmers ain't tippin'
nothing much till after harvest.

18:16.760 --> 18:20.150
- Now, you know that.
- Maybe.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.727
Look at you,
all buttoned up
like Mother Teresa.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.194
( laughing )
I didn't even know
that uniform had buttons.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.765
You can't complain
about Roberta getting
all them tips.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.303
Yeah, well, she
sure 'nuff knows
how to work it.

18:32.340 --> 18:35.275
Shit, as fine
as you is?

18:35.310 --> 18:37.642
You best enjoy this
'fore it's gone.

18:37.680 --> 18:40.774
What is you
talkin' 'bout?

18:40.820 --> 18:43.209
Come on, you realize

18:43.250 --> 18:46.378
I'm just a handful
of years younger
than Ernest was.

18:46.420 --> 18:49.150
Woman, we got
years ahead of us.

18:49.190 --> 18:51.124
Good ones, too.

18:53.360 --> 18:57.660
Everything just
feels different
all of a sudden.

19:01.470 --> 19:04.769
Baby, you grievin'.
It's natural.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.268
Hell, if you wasn't,
that's when I'd be worried.

19:09.910 --> 19:13.846
I just don't
feel like myself.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.782
You just be you.
Ain't nobody like you,
you remember that.

19:27.560 --> 19:31.189
That's good.
That's good.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.764
So...

19:41.440 --> 19:43.840
how'd your
interview go
at the crawfishery?

19:46.980 --> 19:50.541
I couldn't make it.
My pops died.

19:52.590 --> 19:54.911
I'm sorry
to hear that.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.757
Yeah, thanks.
( sniffs )

19:58.830 --> 20:01.719
But if you're gonna cancel
job interviews, you've
gotta let me know first.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.490
Yeah, I--
( sighs )

20:04.530 --> 20:05.963
- yeah.
- All right.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.696
Um, look, my pop,
he left me some land.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.731
Look, it ain't
all worked out yet,

20:10.770 --> 20:12.533
but I can grow
sugar cane on it.

20:12.570 --> 20:15.403
I can farm on it.
I can do everything
I wanna do.

20:17.510 --> 20:20.240
- Okay, all right,
that's good.
- Yeah.

20:20.280 --> 20:23.443
But it still don't
get you what you need.

20:23.490 --> 20:26.914
A pay stub
is a requirement
of your parole.

20:26.950 --> 20:28.053
Okay.

20:28.090 --> 20:30.285
So, what about doing
the farm, and say,
a part-time job?

20:30.330 --> 20:33.390
40 hours.
That's the requirement.

20:36.460 --> 20:39.224
( sighs )

20:41.900 --> 20:44.505
That's
a warehouse job.

20:44.540 --> 20:46.462
The manager
hires parolees.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.870
Thanks. _
AppreCIate It.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.617
You gotta get
and keep a job,
Ralph Angel.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.480
- Or you go back.
- I know.

21:03.530 --> 21:04.986
- All right?
- I got it.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.521
That's
what it is.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.596
Thank you
for comin' out.

21:09.630 --> 21:11.518
All right.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.961
( sighs )

21:17.670 --> 21:21.731
( screen door creaks,
closes )

21:21.780 --> 21:24.999
( sighs )
Blue.

21:26.810 --> 21:28.778
- What's up, man?
- Good.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.549
- How you doing?
- Good.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.512
Yeah? What you
and Kenya doing?

21:32.550 --> 21:34.450
- Playin'.
- What y'all playin'?
Can I play?

21:34.490 --> 21:36.617
_ Man:
VI, can you
warm me up here?

21:36.660 --> 21:38.924
Violet:
You guys been good?

21:38.960 --> 21:42.396
It's hot--
just like you.

21:42.430 --> 21:43.988
- You watch yourself.
- ( men chuckle )

21:46.000 --> 21:48.935
Violet:
All right, ladies.
There you go.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.030
What now?

21:52.070 --> 21:53.879
Davis is
being questioned
by the police.

21:53.910 --> 21:56.879
It's all over
everyone's buzz feed.

21:58.710 --> 22:01.679
It was only
a matter of time before
the vultures got It.

22:04.890 --> 22:07.313
So, did he do it?

22:09.590 --> 22:11.581
She was a hooker.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.723
He paid
to sleep with her.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.422
( faint music playing )

22:20.640 --> 22:23.768
I don't know
what I'm rushin' back
for, to be honest.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.734
I don't even wanna
be in LA. right now.

22:26.770 --> 22:29.102
He got himself
in his mess.

22:29.140 --> 22:32.075
Let him
deal with it.

22:32.110 --> 22:35.568
It's time
to focus on you.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.645
Stay focused,
Charley.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.442
Now, what
can I do?

22:39.490 --> 22:41.378
Let's just get
Daddy's affairs in order,

22:41.420 --> 22:44.025
so it's not hanging
over me-- over us.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.864
So, you invited us
to lunch.

22:51.900 --> 22:55.666
But you forgot
you had to work.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.804
Okay.

22:57.840 --> 23:01.776
I want y'all to stop
bullyin' Ralph Angel.

23:01.810 --> 23:03.402
You can't bully
a grown man, Aunt Vi.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.874
Just listen to him.
That's all.

23:06.910 --> 23:08.969
Let him be a part
of your decision.

23:09.020 --> 23:11.614
You two are goin'
back to your lives,

23:11.650 --> 23:13.550
but he's here.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.478
He needs this.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.420
He needs something.

23:20.190 --> 23:23.694
Okay?
That's all
I got to say.

23:31.470 --> 23:32.903
Hey.

23:32.940 --> 23:34.931
- How you doin'?
- What is it?

23:34.980 --> 23:37.847
Uh, be right back.

23:37.880 --> 23:41.748
( man chuckles )
All right, now.

23:41.780 --> 23:44.112
- Remy, hey.
- Hey.

23:44.150 --> 23:47.449
Maggie, the High Yellow
making lattes now?

23:47.490 --> 23:49.515
You know what?

23:49.560 --> 23:51.482
That ain't never
gonna happen here.

23:51.530 --> 23:52.929
Thank you.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.757
Mind ifI have
a word?

23:54.800 --> 23:56.950
Sure.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.965
Been meaning to...

24:01.000 --> 24:04.561
drop this
tractor clutch off
for the longest.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.932
Told Ralph Angel
I would help him
install it.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.971
How's he doin'?

24:10.010 --> 24:12.171
He's okay.

24:12.210 --> 24:13.848
It's hard,
though.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.440
He and Mr. Ernest
were thick as thieves.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.909
How about you?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.155
Tryin' to figure it out.

24:25.990 --> 24:28.094
The last time we talked,
it seemed like

24:28.130 --> 24:31.167
you had something to say
about Sam Landry.

24:33.570 --> 24:35.629
Yeah.

24:35.670 --> 24:39.106
Let's just say
he has a bad habit
of targeting black farmers

24:39.140 --> 24:41.279
when they're
in distress.

24:41.310 --> 24:43.904
- Buyin' up their land
for much of nothing.
-Hmm.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.975
He make you
an offer yet?

24:46.010 --> 24:48.069
If you can
call it that.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.709
Is that what you
wanna do? Sell?

24:56.620 --> 24:58.781
Still working through
some family stuff.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.855
Hmm.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.118
Look here,
there's a potluck tonight.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.299
You're welcome to join,
especially since y'all

25:05.330 --> 25:07.867
- are still trying
to work things out.
- That's kind, Remy,

25:07.900 --> 25:11.165
but I've got a lot of work
before I have to go back.

25:11.210 --> 25:14.099
You know,
you'd get to meet
some local farmers,

25:14.140 --> 25:16.005
get a chance to see
how it all works--

25:16.040 --> 25:18.179
Thank you
for the invitation.

25:18.210 --> 25:20.747
Just, maybe
another time.

25:20.780 --> 25:25.285
I'll give you the address,
in case you change your mind.

25:36.060 --> 25:38.927
- Nova: Blue sleep?
- Yeah, he knocked out.

25:38.970 --> 25:40.221
What y'all doin'?

25:40.270 --> 25:43.296
Just sortin' through
Daddy's stuff.

25:43.340 --> 25:46.229
So, y'all just
went on ahead without me?

25:46.270 --> 25:48.807
What? I wanted
to look through those!

25:48.840 --> 25:52.947
Rah, stop. Just leave it.
Don't go and mess it up.

25:52.980 --> 25:54.971
There's stuff
I want Blue to have.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.874
Things
I need to pick out
and show him.

25:56.920 --> 26:00.185
We already set aside
Daddy's watch, baseball cap,
all his fishing poles--

26:00.220 --> 26:02.780
It ain't
about that!

26:02.820 --> 26:04.879
I wanted
to do it!

26:10.230 --> 26:12.892
Why are y'all so anxious
to box up the man's life?

26:12.930 --> 26:15.865
We're just tryin'
to get through this.
I need to get back.

26:15.900 --> 26:19.006
So go on
and go back then, Charley!
Ain't nobody stoppin' you!

26:19.040 --> 26:20.871
You need to
calm it down, Rah.

26:20.910 --> 26:24.209
This ain't even your home.
You know that, right?

26:24.250 --> 26:27.105
This just the place
you had to come every summer.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.072
- Ralph Angel--
- What?!

26:29.120 --> 26:30.815
You ain't no better.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.148
Couldn't wait
to get up outta here,
remember?

26:33.190 --> 26:35.681
Couldn't wait to be 18.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.257
But I been here.

26:38.290 --> 26:41.350
Yeah. I'm still here.

26:43.230 --> 26:45.698
( beeping )

26:50.400 --> 26:52.800
( beeping continues )

26:52.840 --> 26:54.979
( brakes hissing )

26:58.210 --> 27:00.098
- Mr. Ernest Bordelon?
- Nova: What's this about?

27:00.150 --> 27:02.948
Ma'am, I've been contracted
to take possession of a tractor

27:02.980 --> 27:04.208
owned by
a Mr. Ernest Bordelon.

27:04.250 --> 27:06.309
He's our father.
He just passed.

27:06.350 --> 27:09.888
Well, Mr. Bordelon
was 90 days past due
on his loans.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.252
Listen, I'm happy
to write a check
to bring the account current.

27:12.290 --> 27:14.121
Okay, why don't
I just do that?

27:14.160 --> 27:16.390
- I really can't.
- What you mean, you can't?

27:16.430 --> 27:19.160
- We put our father
in the ground four days ago.
- You need to talk to the bank.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.691
- Man: I'm just here to do
a job. My boss tells me--
- Our father has died.

27:21.740 --> 27:22.991
- Would you do it?
- ...a chance to actually
review the record--

27:23.040 --> 27:24.132
Would you do it
for your father?

27:24.170 --> 27:25.967
What is the name
of your company then?

27:26.010 --> 27:27.409
- I'm just here
to pick up a tractor.
- Give me an answer.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.135
- What is the name--
- Whoa! Hold on, now!

27:29.180 --> 27:32.377
Y'all need to get back
in your trucks and go.

27:32.410 --> 27:34.275
- Now.
- Rah, don't do this.

27:34.320 --> 27:38.040
Would you please stop?
Just put the gun down.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.718
Now everybody tryin'
to take everything.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.011
( clicks )

27:44.460 --> 27:47.020
Don't do somethin'
you're gonna regret, now.

27:47.060 --> 27:51.064
Boy, you point a gun
at my family, you best
know how to use it.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.421
I know how to use
this right here,

27:53.470 --> 27:55.438
and I'll let it loose
on your ass

27:55.470 --> 27:58.962
'fore I let you take
a damn thing my daddy
worked for.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.171
You best believe that.

28:01.210 --> 28:03.849
So, what you
gonna do, huh?

28:05.280 --> 28:07.817
We gonna do this?

28:16.090 --> 28:18.923
What you gonna do, huh?

28:18.960 --> 28:21.292
We gonna do this?

28:22.460 --> 28:24.462
We don't have to do
anything.

28:24.500 --> 28:28.459
- Ralph Angel...
- Nova: Please, Rah.
Don't do this.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.207
- Listen...
- Rah, you don't
wanna do this.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.208
- Put the gun down.
- Charley: Put it down.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.232
What you best do
is get back in that truck

28:36.280 --> 28:38.248
and take your ass home.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.202
You feel me?

28:40.250 --> 28:43.174
- Nova: Rah...
- Charley: Ralph Angel, think.
Think.

28:43.220 --> 28:46.348
- Think about this.
- Nova: Rah!

28:46.390 --> 28:50.383
- Put the gun down.
Please just--
- Pop!

28:52.530 --> 28:54.953
Pop!

28:55.000 --> 28:58.094
Aw, shit.
( mutters )

28:58.130 --> 29:00.291
Go back inside, Blue!

29:00.330 --> 29:02.195
- Go_on!
- You comIng, Pop?

29:02.240 --> 29:04.401
Go back inside, baby.

29:04.440 --> 29:07.364
No, no, no.
Let's all go inside, okay?

29:07.410 --> 29:09.105
- Charley:
Let's all go inside.
- Blue: You coming, Pop?

29:09.140 --> 29:12.871
Coming, Pop?
Pop, come on.

29:12.910 --> 29:14.969
Come on.

29:15.020 --> 29:18.740
- Charley:
Let's all go inside, okay?
- Blue: Pop, come on! Pop!

29:27.160 --> 29:29.094
Come on.

29:29.130 --> 29:31.428
Let's go.

29:42.580 --> 29:44.445
- ( tractor door closes )
- ( tow chain rattles )

29:44.480 --> 29:48.211
Come on, come on.
Let's all go inside.

29:48.250 --> 29:51.117
( tow truck whirrs )

29:55.590 --> 29:58.457
It's okay.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.884
( Ralph Angel sobbing )

30:25.390 --> 30:27.142
I'm sorry.

30:27.190 --> 30:29.055
Shh.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.828
I'm sorry.

30:44.270 --> 30:47.501
- ( whispers )
- Come here.

30:48.440 --> 30:51.500
( sobbing )

31:15.240 --> 31:21.008
I started farming
in this parish
more than 50 years ago.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.099
Wish I could say
things have changed,

31:23.140 --> 31:25.199
but we all know
they ain't.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.104
Man:
Not a damn thing changed.

31:27.150 --> 31:30.017
Prosper:
Mills still givin' us
less than white farmers.

31:30.050 --> 31:32.644
Banks still lendin' us
less money

31:32.690 --> 31:34.487
when we
fall on hard times.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.317
Man:
Not a damn thing.

31:36.360 --> 31:40.285
Farm subsidies ain't the same
for us as it is for them.

31:40.330 --> 31:41.991
Man:
Damn right.

31:42.030 --> 31:46.262
Now, I've seen
some good farmers,
good men,

31:46.300 --> 31:48.461
forced off their land

31:48.500 --> 31:51.469
because they can't
make a living no more.

31:53.170 --> 31:57.402
I may be retired,
but I've watched y'all

31:57.440 --> 32:01.274
bring in your crops
year after year.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.675
That gives me hope.

32:03.720 --> 32:06.985
That makes me
proud of y'all.

32:07.020 --> 32:10.649
Remy, I thank you
for bringing us
all together.

32:10.690 --> 32:13.227
- Of course.
- God bless y'all.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.921
Remy:
Hey, let's eat.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.104
Remy:
Thanks, Richard.
Good to see ya, man.

32:24.140 --> 32:26.062
Thank you.

32:27.740 --> 32:31.699
Remy:
Good to see ya, brother
We'll talk soon. All right.

32:31.750 --> 32:35.015
Hey, hey, hey.
You don't need to do
all that.

32:35.050 --> 32:36.608
Please.

32:38.350 --> 32:41.581
Okay.

32:41.620 --> 32:44.589
- Glad I came.
- Yeah.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.723
I _met a lot
of InterestIng
characters tonight.

32:49.230 --> 32:52.563
Your daddy started
these potlucks,
you know?

32:52.600 --> 32:54.192
( car doors close,
engines starting )

32:54.240 --> 32:56.629
Yeah, he was
like a preacher
at these things.

32:56.670 --> 32:59.230
Reminding us all
why we were out here,

32:59.270 --> 33:02.433
_ and what
It really means.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.404
_ He never woulda
gIven up on hIs farm,

33:05.450 --> 33:09.045
no matter
how hard it got.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.389
I'm no fool.

33:13.490 --> 33:15.754
Look,

33:15.790 --> 33:20.181
I know with everything
that's goin' on
in your life...

33:20.230 --> 33:24.462
I understand how tough
this decision is,
but...

33:24.500 --> 33:27.765
I just hope y'all
don't sell to Landry.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.234
You know
of another buyer?

33:30.270 --> 33:32.306
No, that's not
what I mean.

33:33.740 --> 33:35.708
I mean,
why sell at all?

33:37.540 --> 33:39.349
You sound
like Ralph Angel.

33:39.380 --> 33:43.043
I mean, you're sitting
on a nice piece of land,
Mrs. West.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.810
Most black farmers
have to lease their land.

33:45.850 --> 33:48.785
Can only dream
of ownin' somethin'.

33:48.820 --> 33:52.358
You have means,
so you have choices

33:52.390 --> 33:54.620
where most don't.

33:59.270 --> 34:01.397
Hypothetically
speaking...

34:01.440 --> 34:03.362
Mm-hmm?

34:03.400 --> 34:05.265
what would it take

34:05.310 --> 34:07.733
to get it
up and running?

34:07.770 --> 34:11.103
Money, hard work,
prayers,

34:11.150 --> 34:14.176
more money,
and a hell of a lot
of luck.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.279
Now you sound like you're
talking me out of it.

34:16.320 --> 34:19.585
I probably should.

34:19.620 --> 34:23.283
This work is gonna
test your soul.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.550
But...

34:25.590 --> 34:27.421
But?

34:27.460 --> 34:29.792
I think your soul
can handle it.

34:30.730 --> 34:33.369
( crickets chirping )

34:45.280 --> 34:48.579
* I just want to

34:48.620 --> 34:52.841
* Close my eyes
and feel my sadness *

34:56.420 --> 35:00.322
* Just look forward

35:00.360 --> 35:04.421
* Not behind...

35:14.340 --> 35:16.331
Why are you
still up?

35:16.380 --> 35:18.143
Couldn't sleep.

35:20.510 --> 35:23.115
I packed the rest
of your stuff.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.659
We're staying
the rest of the week.

35:28.690 --> 35:30.658
I've gotta finish this
negotiation for Grandpa.

35:30.690 --> 35:32.624
We'll rebook the flights
for the weekend--

35:32.660 --> 35:34.491
First it was last night,
now we're staying--

35:34.530 --> 35:36.350
Now things have changed.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.790
I need to figure out
what to do with your
grandpa's land.

35:42.670 --> 35:45.935
Do you even care
about Dad?

35:45.970 --> 35:47.904
Why would you
ask me that?

35:47.940 --> 35:50.500
Tsk.

35:50.540 --> 35:54.317
'Cause if you did,
we'd be home by now.

35:54.350 --> 35:57.274
I just think you believe
some of the stuff people
have been sayin' about him.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.787
You're wrong,
I don't.

35:58.820 --> 36:01.288
Okay, then
why aren't you
supporting him?

36:03.290 --> 36:05.520
Because either he...

36:05.560 --> 36:08.256
raped that lady or...

36:08.300 --> 36:11.326
is that why you
don't have his back?

36:13.400 --> 36:16.858
Your dad did some things
he shouldn't have,

36:17.840 --> 36:20.434
andiUs
gonna come out.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.805
But no.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.273
No, he didn't rape her.

36:30.450 --> 36:32.543
Okay, well,
he needs us.

36:32.590 --> 36:35.616
We're going back.

36:35.660 --> 36:38.185
Just a few more days.

36:41.260 --> 36:43.922
Like, you go back
when you want,

36:43.960 --> 36:46.963
but I'm goin' back
tomorrow.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.560
You'll go back
when I say it's time
to go back.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.830
I'm 15.

36:51.870 --> 36:53.838
I can fly by myself.
Rocky will pick me up.

36:53.870 --> 36:56.236
You don't know what's
waiting back there for us.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.373
There are paparazzi
surrounding our house.

36:58.410 --> 37:01.447
Yeah, and Dad.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.347
Dad's back
there alone.

37:06.550 --> 37:08.984
I'm going, Mom.

37:11.430 --> 37:15.457
Fine. You think you're
old enough to handle it,
you go right ahead.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.234
( door creaks, closes )

37:42.420 --> 37:44.479
( clatters )

37:44.530 --> 37:47.624
( faint siren wails )

37:56.040 --> 38:00.409
* Row, row, rowin'
in a dream *

38:01.510 --> 38:04.502
* We drifted far

38:04.550 --> 38:07.678
* On down the stream...

38:07.710 --> 38:11.419
( music continues )

38:12.620 --> 38:13.780
Is Blue okay?

38:13.820 --> 38:16.050
( music continues )

39:15.750 --> 39:17.638
( faint whirring )

39:20.190 --> 39:24.354
Man:
Jarvis sends me a lot
of fellas like you.

39:31.030 --> 39:33.089
I take it
you're Innocent
like the rest?

39:36.970 --> 39:40.064
No, I did it.

39:40.110 --> 39:42.738
I'm done with all that.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.702
Just tryin' to move on.

39:51.050 --> 39:53.143
Job's yours
if you want it.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.711
Truth is,
I could use you today,
if you're up for it.

40:00.060 --> 40:02.494
I'm up for it.

40:15.540 --> 40:18.031
All right,
see y'all tomorrow.

40:24.550 --> 40:26.541
This way.

40:28.820 --> 40:31.721
- * Never give up...
- Tomorrow.

40:35.030 --> 40:38.022
* I'm just livin' life

40:38.060 --> 40:40.096
- * Day by day...
- ( door creaks )

40:40.130 --> 40:43.167
- Ralph Angel:
What's up, y'all?
- Hey.

40:43.200 --> 40:47.637
So... we went through
Daddy's papers.

40:47.670 --> 40:51.208
And it turns out
he's in more debt
that we thought.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.471
If we sell to Landry,
we'll barely break even.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.373
Yeah.

40:55.420 --> 40:58.048
So the whole parish,
all these farmers

40:58.080 --> 41:01.049
'bout to find out
'bout Pop's business?

41:02.720 --> 41:04.529
That ain't
happening.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.187
Charley and I,

41:06.230 --> 41:08.698
we think you and Blue
should move into
Daddy's house.

41:10.900 --> 41:12.720
Y'all...

41:12.770 --> 41:14.499
I'm shocked.

41:16.670 --> 41:18.228
What about
the farm?

41:18.270 --> 41:21.501
Like I said,
I'm not signin' up
to be no farmer.

41:21.540 --> 41:24.703
I ain't gonna do it.
Uh, but we got a plan.

41:24.750 --> 41:27.207
Yeah.
It won't be easy,

41:27.250 --> 41:29.514
but we think
we should go for it.

41:29.550 --> 41:32.713
Just farm it for a year,
and then we see about
seIIIng.

41:32.750 --> 41:35.617
- Just for a year?
- Nova: Let's see how it goes
for a season.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.616
- Okay? That's fair, Rah.
- I'll be back and forth

41:37.660 --> 41:40.652
between LA. and St. Jo.,
and I'll handle the finances.

41:40.690 --> 41:43.250
Nova will take care
of papenNork and
administration,

41:43.300 --> 41:46.895
and Rah,
you're gonna play
a big, big role

41:46.930 --> 41:48.795
in getting it
back in shape,
you know?

41:48.840 --> 41:50.592
The planting,
the harvesting.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.267
Because after
we brIng In a crop,

41:52.310 --> 41:54.733
I bet we get
what it's really worth.

41:54.780 --> 41:58.136
If...
we all decide.

42:00.310 --> 42:03.746
- Nova: We good?
- All right, I'm good.

42:03.780 --> 42:05.680
Yeah?
( laughs )

42:06.890 --> 42:08.619
( phone rings )

42:08.660 --> 42:11.015
I wondered if I was
gonna hear from you.

42:11.060 --> 42:13.858
You're a smart
little lady.

42:13.890 --> 42:16.757
Your family's lucky
to have your business savw
under the circumstances.

42:16.800 --> 42:21.169
We're not selling.
We're bringing in the cane
ourselves this year.

42:22.670 --> 42:27.107
Huh. Well, I better
let you get to it.

42:27.140 --> 42:29.108
But be careful, ma'am.

42:29.140 --> 42:32.803
We do business a little
differently down here
than where you come from.

42:35.380 --> 42:37.769
You'd be surprised
at how much I know

42:37.820 --> 42:40.914
about business, sir.

42:40.950 --> 42:42.781
Uh-huh.

42:42.820 --> 42:46.256
* Keep the colors
in the lines-- take flight. *

42:46.290 --> 42:49.191
