<i>Previously on Revolution...</i>

00:04.560 --> 00:07.154
We're gonna need you
to fix that code, Mr. Pittman!

00:07.360 --> 00:09.397
You're a machine, and you're dying,

00:09.560 --> 00:11.597
<i>and you're losing control
every second.</i>

00:12.680 --> 00:15.559
If the nano really are dying,
these must be its death throes.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.194
Unh!

00:17.440 --> 00:19.670
Rachel. She's not breathing,
Aaron, do something!

00:19.840 --> 00:20.875
I'm fixing the code!

00:21.080 --> 00:22.991
Do you hear me?
I am fixing you!

00:25.960 --> 00:28.713
Thank you, Mr. Pittman,
for fixing us.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.275
Now we can move on to other things.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.000
- What are we gonna do now?
- I <i>wanna go</i> home.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.834
- What's all this?
- The kid saved my life.

00:38.520 --> 00:39.999
<i>A debt is a debt.</i>

00:40.160 --> 00:42.117
Take the guys
and go get your Patriots.

00:42.280 --> 00:45.352
- Let's go, boys.
- They don't take orders from you.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.278
They take orders from her.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.232
Okay. Come on, then.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.232
Drop it.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.317
Now you wanna tell me
what the hell's going on?

00:53.480 --> 00:55.312
It's Julia. She's alive.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.198
<i>- The Patriots have her...</i>
- Tom!

00:57.360 --> 00:58.839
<i>And they will kill her.</i>

00:59.000 --> 01:01.469
All I need is Monroe.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.757
Can't do it, Tom.
Monroe's with us now.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.116
- Just put the gun down, Tom.
- I need Monroe.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.830
Or I need you as bait to catch him,
or Julia's dead.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.593
Then she's dead.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.913
Or...

01:32.080 --> 01:35.960
how about I shoot your
sister-in-law's pretty face off?

01:38.440 --> 01:40.158
I don't think you Will.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.993
You fire...

01:42.440 --> 01:43.953
...and we fire...

01:45.320 --> 01:47.960
We all bite it
and Julia's dead anyway.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.630
Are you telling me
that you're really willing

01:51.840 --> 01:55.515
to take your last breath
for a sack of crap like Monroe?

01:59.040 --> 02:01.031

02:08.600 --> 02:09.829
Son of a bitch.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.798
- I want him alive!
- Call your men off!

02:11.960 --> 02:15.555
Sir, Matheson's as good as gone.

02:16.760 --> 02:19.195

02:36.080 --> 02:38.390
Man: <i>I lost half</i> a <i>dozen men last night,</i>

02:38.560 --> 02:40.392
and you've got the stones
to ask me for more?

02:40.560 --> 02:43.598
No one asked for Team Baby Huey
to come barreling in.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.590
Sir, so, yes...

02:49.760 --> 02:50.909
...I need more men.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.071
And I need to do it my way.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.753
You're on your own.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.432
You're a fine Chief of Staff.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.911
And I know Willoughby's
a priority, must be.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.033
But I also know that finding Monroe

03:10.200 --> 03:12.350
is important to the president, too.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.600
Ed. You're dismissed.

03:21.520 --> 03:22.669
But this is my office.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.229
Just do as you're told, Ed.
It's what you're good at.

03:33.360 --> 03:36.034
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

03:36.600 --> 03:38.591
You know, ahem,

03:38.760 --> 03:42.640
when you and... your wife

03:42.800 --> 03:45.792
did what you did to me,
I enthusiastically

03:45.960 --> 03:49.351
requested your executions.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.956
But the president had other ideas.

03:54.560 --> 03:58.997
I consider it a personal affront
that you two are still breathing.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.719
So when I find Monroe,
me, you know what I'll ask for?

04:03.880 --> 04:08.477
You and your bitch wife's heads
as bookends.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.034
I can't stop you from trying
to look for the man,

04:13.200 --> 04:16.591
but I sure as hell
am not going to help you.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.159
Are we clear?

04:20.839 --> 04:22.319
Perfectly.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.998
So, tell me something.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.510
"Earth, Wind, and Fire" back here,
they're with you 24/7, right?

04:34.680 --> 04:37.354
Yeah. So?

04:37.520 --> 04:39.113
Well, I'm just wondering
how you find the time

04:39.280 --> 04:41.032
to sneak off and bang my son.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.957
- Jeez.
- No, I get it. I get it.

04:45.120 --> 04:48.397
No, where there's a will,
there's a way, right?

04:49.360 --> 04:50.794
Blackout with your cackout.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.554
- Yeah, whatever that means.
- You know, it's interesting.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.559
Of all the guys you choose to screw,

04:57.720 --> 04:58.869
you choose a Monroe.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.838
I'm gonna be sick.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.515
Take it easy.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.239
Hold your fire.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.874
You look terrible.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.399
(CHUCKLES)
So do you.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.752
So much for coming in stealth.
Could hear you a mile away.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.831
Yeah, well, we're not
exactly traveling light.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.560
(SIGHS)

05:35.920 --> 05:37.593
You know, we could
use twice as many guys.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.433
We were lucky to get them.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.591
All right.

05:44.760 --> 05:48.037
I had money, you'd screw us over,
but I'll give you this one,

05:48.240 --> 05:51.153
-you did all right.
- Yeah, well, one, suck it.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.435
Two...

05:53.360 --> 05:55.749
It wasn't me.
It was your niece.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.230
Come on.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.437
Our safe house isn't so safe anymore.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.509
This way, GUYS-

06:23.800 --> 06:24.835
Hey.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.236
- You see that?
- See what?

06:29.600 --> 06:30.795
Well, I hate to be the one
to tell you,

06:30.960 --> 06:32.553
but they're sleeping together.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.633
Charlie and Connor?
No.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.119
Why do you say that?

06:40.280 --> 06:42.954
I know a little something
about having a wild daughter.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.271
So Neville's with the Patriots.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.353
They got his wife.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.078
And he's shadier than you.
What'd you expect?

06:56.160 --> 06:59.198
All right, let's go put him
out of his misery.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.310
First things first.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.715
First? What do you mean?

07:01.800 --> 07:03.393
What's more important than
killing someone who wants me dead?

07:03.560 --> 07:04.630
Come on, I'll show you.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.719
No, Miles,
I've just been walking for four days.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.996
- Can I sit on my ass for a minute?
- Nope.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.350
Man: <i>Get under that wire!
Get under that wire!</i>

07:13.520 --> 07:14.999
<i>Crawl home to mama!</i>

07:15.200 --> 07:18.830
Let's go! Are you a Patriot, huh?
You don't look like a Patriot!

07:19.200 --> 07:21.077
(YELLING CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

07:22.840 --> 07:24.274
Man, it's like...

07:25.400 --> 07:27.596
<i>...full-on Full Metal Jacket
down there.</i>

07:28.960 --> 07:31.600
Seems like all I do lately
is lay up here,

07:31.800 --> 07:34.997
rocks in my junk,
spying on these fools.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.514
They're just kids.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.597
Where'd they get
all the new recruits?

07:39.360 --> 07:41.510
Some from Crockett, Huntsville.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.716
Most of these kids, though,
they're from Willoughby.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.712
Check out two o'clock.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.590
It's a munitions dump.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.594
Seen him offload 6O mil mortars,

07:56.760 --> 07:58.751
155 mil shells.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.560
Monroe: What the hell do they need
that kind of firepower for?

08:01.720 --> 08:05.076
I don't know.
We could use it.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.470
I was just gonna say the same thing.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.358
Great minds, right?

08:11.840 --> 08:13.797
Don't compare your brain to mine.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.830
Monroe: No, I'm telling you,
you should've seen it.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.516
Connor in Vegas.
Kid's got some moves.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.033
He's gonna be better than me one day.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.833
All right, hold up. I gotta...
I gotta hit the head.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.078
So you're happy your kid's a killer?

08:36.280 --> 08:38.635
Oh, hell, yeah.
Kinda proud, you know?

08:38.799 --> 08:40.711
Guess it's like the family business.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.793
Hey.
Facedown, now.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.395
Get on the ground.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.278
Down!

08:51.680 --> 08:54.718
So you suck
at sneaking up on people, FYI.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.554
How old are you, seven?

09:08.280 --> 09:10.635
Get up. Up.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.319
So what do you want to do with 'em?

09:15.360 --> 09:16.998
Should we kill 'em?

09:32.800 --> 09:35.599
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

09:56.480 --> 09:57.914
When do you think
we'll reach Willoughby?

09:59.360 --> 10:01.237
About a week or so.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.479
Oh, my God.

10:09.520 --> 10:13.673
Is this not the best apple
you've ever eaten?

10:17.400 --> 10:18.515
Yup.

10:20.200 --> 10:25.320
It's just like every other apple
I've ever eaten, ever.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.789
- What?
- What's gotten into you?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.029
What do you mean?

10:36.200 --> 10:39.830
I mean, ever since Lubbock,
you've been...

10:43.680 --> 10:45.079
Happy?

10:46.560 --> 10:49.120
We've been through hell, Aaron.

10:49.280 --> 10:53.239
But we survived.
I mean, we're here.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.638
We're here together.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.791
I don't know,
I've just been thinking,

10:58.960 --> 10:59.950
maybe...

11:04.720 --> 11:06.393
Maybe that's a good thing.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.349
Now, don't forget the jib sail.

11:21.560 --> 11:22.311
(DOOR OPENS)

11:22.800 --> 11:24.359
Mr. President.

11:25.240 --> 11:27.675
Oh. Hey, Ron.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.554
Look at you.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.519
You're just growing like a weed,
aren't you?

11:33.680 --> 11:35.512
What's the latest from Doyle?

11:38.640 --> 11:41.712
Well, you can speak freely.
We have nothing to hide.

11:43.320 --> 11:46.278
The Willoughby reeducation center
is up and running, sir.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.956
- Does General Carver have any idea?
- General Carver's a grade-A...

11:51.240 --> 11:53.754
He's a silly, silly man.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.720
He's the commander of Texas.
Don't underestimate him.

12:00.200 --> 12:03.113
Just make sure our cadets are
activated by the end of the month.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.199
We're on schedule.
It's going well. Trust me.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.072
Roger, our plan to take Texas
depends on those cadets.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.709
And from there,
the rest of the continent.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.633
Which means that backwater,
inbred boot camp

12:16.800 --> 12:18.916
is one of the most
important ones we've got.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.633
And Monroe and Matheson
are still at large...

12:23.480 --> 12:25.471
...around the very same camp.

12:27.880 --> 12:31.589
But I should just... trust you.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.878
Is that what I should do?

12:38.360 --> 12:39.998
Get those cadets in the field...

12:41.080 --> 12:44.789
...or I'll have you and Doyle
and your families shot.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.189
Understand?

12:47.840 --> 12:49.433
Yes, Mr. President.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.679
(DOOR OPENS)

12:52.760 --> 12:54.512

What?

13:17.240 --> 13:18.913
Move it. Let's go.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.869
Come on.
Pick up the pace.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.075
Pick it up.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.639
Dillon?

13:30.400 --> 13:31.390
Kim?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.315
You know these kids?

13:34.520 --> 13:37.319
Know 'em? I...
I delivered them.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.795
- What's going on?
- They're from the boot camp.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.075
Were spying on us.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.754
Are you all right?

13:47.760 --> 13:48.909
- Guys?
- They're fine, Gene.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.400
I'm terrific too.
Now, move!

13:50.560 --> 13:51.595
Tie 'em up.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.239
Keep moving.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.113
I've seen you around town, right?

14:17.160 --> 14:19.470
We hit that munitions dump,
it's gonna cause a lot of damage.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.999
It'll give us a window to get in,
mop up the rest.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.595
So you're just gonna charge in,
guns blazing?

14:25.800 --> 14:27.711
What about the kids in that camp?

14:28.480 --> 14:30.471
We'll save as many as we can, Gene.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.638
- But not all of them?
- Look, now, they're the town's kids.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.996
Next week, they're Patriots.
We're killing them anyway.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.992
Yeah, Gene, I don't like this
any more than you do.

14:38.160 --> 14:41.198
But that boot camp...
Bad for us.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.993
- If there was another way...
- Miles.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.198
I know these children.
I've...

14:47.040 --> 14:48.553
...practically raised them.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.839
What is the point of saving this town

14:53.000 --> 14:55.071
if we have to murder
its children to do it?

14:55.240 --> 14:57.470
I'm not here to save anyone.

14:57.640 --> 15:01.713
I thought we were here to win.
Aren't we?

15:21.360 --> 15:23.317
We've got this.
Thanks.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.554
Hungry?

15:30.720 --> 15:33.951
Come on. You're skin and bones.
You know us. Please eat.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.960
That's quite a shiner
you got there, Kim.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.872
Where'd you get it?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.951
How'd you end up in that camp?

16:00.920 --> 16:02.035
You have to talk to us.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.554
We enlisted.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.550
You what?

16:05.720 --> 16:07.552
All the kids did.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.472
They gave a big speech,

16:09.640 --> 16:11.756
said they needed our help.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.438
We wanted to do it.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.274
Are you gonna kill us?

16:30.720 --> 16:33.997
So, what? I can't even interrogate
my own prisoners now?

16:35.040 --> 16:36.633
Gene and Rachel can handle this.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.838
Yeah?
Well, I get answers a lot quicker.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.512
Why don't you give 'em a chance? Hmm?
They know these kids.

16:45.680 --> 16:48.877
The Nazis were somebody's kid, Miles.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.792
Everyone is someone's kid.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.759
If we really want to win this thing,
it's gotta be with you and me

not Yoko and her dad.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.874
- We need them.
- We don't need them.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.434
I didn't even want 'em.

17:02.160 --> 17:06.118
I trust them...
a hell of a lot more than I trust you.

17:20.119 --> 17:21.440
Hey!

17:26.160 --> 17:27.513
Gene!

17:29.480 --> 17:32.120
- What do you think you're doing?
- They don't know anything.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.675
And they're children.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.035
I'm taking them home.

17:36.240 --> 17:39.437
The hell you are.
They'll give away our position.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.114
Then we'll get another position.
We're not leaving them with you.

17:42.280 --> 17:44.510
- I'm not letting you leave.
- Then go ahead and shoot us.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.316
- Oh, you think I won't, old man?
- All right! Okay!

17:48.320 --> 17:50.789
Everybody... put your junk away.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.032
Chill out.
I'll handle this.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.392
I said I'll handle it.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.514
It's okay.
Come on.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.830
So go handle it.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.396
Looks like trouble in paradise.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.597
You haven't tried to stop us.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.757
I'm not Monroe.

18:59.920 --> 19:03.629
I'm not gonna sweat a couple of kids.
You wanna toss 'em back? Go ahead.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.313
We'll survive.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.074
But you know he's right.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.710
Patriots have their hooks
in Willoughby.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.470
If we're gonna win this thing,
there's gonna be collateral damage.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.631
Just being realistic.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.550
I know all about collateral damage.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.391
My son was collateral damage.

19:28.760 --> 19:32.196
How do I let Monroe
kill someone else's kid?

19:32.360 --> 19:34.590
More than that, help him do that?

19:35.360 --> 19:36.839
How?

- Pull 'em out of camp?
- That camp isn't safe, Grant.

You don't know these Patriots.

next to a wanted terrorist.

- They're lying to you, Grant.
- Really?

20:33.360 --> 20:35.510
Well, from what they tell me,
you're one of them too, Gene.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.796
Saying it pretty much
runs in the family.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.877
I should shoot you where you stand.

And they don't know where he is.
I do.

get Monroe ourselves.

- Because once we do...

in a Mel Gibson movie.

was ruined by perverts and parasites.

was our punishment,

this is our chance to atone.

I see it as natural selection.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.076

we believe in.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.270
Like it says on the dollar
right under the pyramid,

35:33.480 --> 35:35.391
<i>novus ordo seclorum.</i>

35:35.560 --> 35:39.235
"A new order for the ages."

35:41.920 --> 35:43.194
Sir.

35:43.360 --> 35:46.352
Even if we're able to convert
the other soldiers on the base,

35:46.520 --> 35:49.273
-the mainland's a different story.
- Plans are in motion.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.998
For one, my assistant secretary
Randall Flynn

35:52.160 --> 35:54.071
is making preparations,
and this gentleman...

35:54.760 --> 35:57.593
...is gonna help us
win hearts and minds. Victor.

35:57.800 --> 36:01.555
Thank you, sir. I'm Victor Doyle.
I'm a consultant with the DOD.

36:02.520 --> 36:05.034
I specialize in interrogation
and reeducation,

36:05.200 --> 36:07.077
and I can promise you
that whether people join us

36:07.240 --> 36:09.959
willingly or not
doesn't really matter,

36:10.120 --> 36:12.236
as long as you know how
to apply pressure

36:12.440 --> 36:13.999
in all the right places.

36:17.160 --> 36:20.073
For those who've been
watching in frustration

36:20.280 --> 36:24.069
as our once-proud nation withered
and died, this is your moment.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.635
You will be the new Founding Fathers,

36:26.800 --> 36:30.111
remembered and hailed forever.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.274
- I didn't sign on to be a--
- A fawning little bitch,

36:42.440 --> 36:44.317
who can't seem to stay
in his own office?

36:45.080 --> 36:48.436
Watch your mouth.
This is all because of you.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.951
Please. It's because of Doyle,
and you know it.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.798
Someone should do something
about that man.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.793
You know what I mean?

37:09.080 --> 37:11.833
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

37:18.440 --> 37:19.555
Miles.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.309
You did the right thing.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.512
I'm not so sure.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.554
(DOOR OPENS)

37:49.000 --> 37:49.990
Not now.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.873
I can't believe
you didn't take that shot.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.593
What the hell is wrong with you, Miles?

37:53.760 --> 37:55.637
You want to win this thing or not?

37:59.480 --> 38:00.754
Why do you want to win?

38:02.240 --> 38:06.029
What the hell does that...
What is that supposed to mean? I want...

38:07.040 --> 38:09.031
I want revenge.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.111
They destroyed Philly.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.320
Yeah, you said that.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.631
Then you said you didn't care.

38:17.560 --> 38:19.710
Then you said all you wanted
was your son. Now you got him.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.712
I don't know, Bass.
Can't keep your story straight.

38:21.880 --> 38:23.393
What the hell is your problem, Miles?

38:23.560 --> 38:26.393
You don't care about saving the town.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.550
You don't care about anything
but saving yourself.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.712
Maybe your kid.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.119
All of this...

38:37.040 --> 38:39.919
...is because you want to get
the Republic back. Isn't it?

38:40.080 --> 38:43.357
God, you are...
You are so wrong.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.830
And you are a really bad liar.

38:50.480 --> 38:54.951
You want to wipe out the Patriot
competition so you can waltz in...

38:55.960 --> 38:58.190
...set up some kind of

38:58.360 --> 39:00.158
half-ass father-son kingdom.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.035
Family business.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.598
At least I got vision.

39:13.800 --> 39:16.918
At least I know
what I'm fighting for, Miles.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.633
YOU?

39:19.520 --> 39:21.397
What the hell are you doing?

39:21.560 --> 39:23.437
What do you think
is gonna happen here?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.071
You gonna take out these Patriot sons
of bitches, then what will you do?

39:26.240 --> 39:28.390
You gonna retire, huh?
You gonna...

39:28.560 --> 39:31.393
You're gonna play house
with your two girls?

39:31.560 --> 39:34.279
Is that what you want, huh?
Please.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.431
God, that is not you, Miles.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.273
That is not you, and you know it.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.271
So what are you fighting for, huh?

39:47.080 --> 39:48.309
Tell me.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.313
What do you want, Miles?

40:05.840 --> 40:06.591
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

40:06.840 --> 40:08.239
Come in.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.029
You wanted to see me, sir?

40:17.200 --> 40:18.918
Yes, I did.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.196
- What is this?
- All right, just relax.

40:27.200 --> 40:31.637
"4-2-4-7-4."

40:38.080 --> 40:40.549
This is Commanding Officer
Victor Doyle speaking.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.199
Yes, sir.

40:44.640 --> 40:47.200
Let's have a chat about your father.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.800
I would love to know
what the man's thinking.
