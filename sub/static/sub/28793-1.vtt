Miss Dalton,
I am really impressed.

00:31.520 --> 00:34.521
Thank you. And
please call me Nic.

00:34.523 --> 00:35.622
Nic.

00:35.624 --> 00:37.057
I really appreciate
you coming in today.

00:37.059 --> 00:38.558
It was a pleasure meeting you.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.660
And we're gonna let all our
candidates know on Monday, okay.

00:40.662 --> 00:42.495
Um, okay, I'm sorry,
we've been talking here

00:42.497 --> 00:44.464
for the last 45 minutes, so.

00:44.466 --> 00:46.266
Are you blowing me off?

00:46.268 --> 00:47.534
Just level with me, because...

00:47.536 --> 00:49.469
You're nine credit
hours short of obtaining

00:49.471 --> 00:52.072
your Associates Degree,
is that correct?

00:52.074 --> 00:53.640
Because I am assuming
that you dropped out.

00:53.642 --> 00:55.608
Well, I had some
family issues that I,

00:55.610 --> 00:57.510
that required me to
leave school, yes.

00:57.512 --> 01:00.280
Mmmhmm. And you also list
your current employment

01:00.282 --> 01:04.818
as a bartender at, um,
yeah, at the Soggy Weasel.

01:04.819 --> 01:07.620
And your only reference,
a Murphy Dalton.

01:07.622 --> 01:09.856
Is there any relation?

01:09.858 --> 01:12.559
Um, yes, he's my father.

01:12.561 --> 01:13.561
Right.

01:15.530 --> 01:17.130
Dolores if you just
give me a minute,

01:17.132 --> 01:18.398
60 seconds to explain.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.144
After that if you're
not fully convinced

01:20.145 --> 01:21.889
that I'd be a valuable
team member here at PNR

01:21.890 --> 01:23.634
then I'll walk out that
door, no hard feelings.

01:23.638 --> 01:25.472
Okay.

01:25.474 --> 01:27.540
Yes I work for my father.

01:27.542 --> 01:30.610
He needed a bartender,
and I needed a job.

01:30.612 --> 01:32.612
But in the six months
that I've worked there,

01:32.614 --> 01:34.714
I've crafted a strong
social media presence.

01:34.716 --> 01:36.382
I've spearheaded promotions

01:36.384 --> 01:38.852
that have almost
doubled his revenue.

01:38.854 --> 01:40.487
So if you're
looking for somebody

01:40.489 --> 01:44.791
with real life marketing
experience, I'm your girl.

01:46.128 --> 01:49.395
Okay, Nic, PNR is a
Fortune 500 company.

01:50.532 --> 01:52.632
Okay, it's not a dive
bar whose livelihood

01:52.634 --> 01:55.268
depends on two for one drink
specials and, you know,

01:55.270 --> 01:56.569
wet t-shirt contests put on by

01:56.571 --> 01:58.438
the owner's tattoo
covered daughter.

01:58.440 --> 02:01.474
Look I appreciate your
enthusiasm, I really do,

02:01.476 --> 02:03.476
but when it all comes down to it

02:03.478 --> 02:06.546
you're a college drop out with
a great memorization skill

02:06.548 --> 02:09.181
for our about us
section of our website.

02:10.519 --> 02:11.668
I just, I don't see a
place for you here at PNR.

02:11.669 --> 02:13.309
Ah, you know I can
tell that this bridge

02:13.922 --> 02:15.388
is already like covered
in gasoline right now.

02:15.390 --> 02:16.589
- Excuse me?
- So I'm gonna light a match

02:16.591 --> 02:18.491
and I withdraw my
application, you know,

02:18.493 --> 02:20.527
and I would tell you to
go straight to hell but

02:20.529 --> 02:22.629
you already managed to
find your way there.

02:22.631 --> 02:24.464
Welcome home honey.

03:58.793 --> 04:01.461
Mr. Cooper, what's happening?

04:01.463 --> 04:03.730
Oh, just running a
diagnostic on the mainframe.

04:03.732 --> 04:04.897
Hmm.

04:04.899 --> 04:06.599
I'm sorry sir,

04:06.601 --> 04:08.468
I don't have a record of
a maintenance visit today.

04:08.470 --> 04:11.504
That's strange. I know I
have an email from the boss

04:11.506 --> 04:13.306
in here somewhere.

04:13.308 --> 04:15.642
Oh, I'm sorry, here it is.

04:15.644 --> 04:17.744
Here, sign right there.

05:13.768 --> 05:15.702
Nothing to worry about,
just a mislabeled directory.

05:15.704 --> 05:17.771
Have a good weekend.

05:17.772 --> 05:19.839
Sir, aren't you
forgetting something.

05:26.081 --> 05:27.780
Eager to get your
weekend started, huh?

05:27.782 --> 05:29.649
You have no idea.

05:50.839 --> 05:55.708
♪ Well my old man swore
up 'til the day he died ♪

05:55.710 --> 05:57.744
♪ He was a diesel driver ♪

05:57.746 --> 06:00.747
♪ Gave Kristofferson a ride ♪

06:00.749 --> 06:05.785
♪ In the Louisiana
rain with Bobby McGee ♪

06:09.424 --> 06:10.690
Just ridiculous.

06:10.692 --> 06:11.524
I know, I'm late.

06:11.526 --> 06:12.592
Consistently late.

06:12.594 --> 06:14.861
You're consistently large.

06:14.863 --> 06:16.729
So how'd the interview go?

06:16.731 --> 06:18.431
Fantastic, they
hired me on the spot.

06:18.433 --> 06:21.868
I'm putting in my two
weeks notice right now.

06:21.870 --> 06:22.735
Really?

06:22.737 --> 06:24.470
No.

06:24.472 --> 06:25.538
Thank god.

06:27.142 --> 06:29.175
I didn't mean that
like it sounds.

06:29.177 --> 06:31.043
I just, I need somebody here

06:31.045 --> 06:33.513
for a couple more
months that can...

06:33.515 --> 06:34.847
Basically do all
your bookkeeping,

06:34.849 --> 06:38.751
take care of the bar, keep
your ass out of the fire.

06:38.753 --> 06:39.886
Really Nic?

06:40.922 --> 06:42.789
Really is it that bad?

06:42.791 --> 06:44.023
You know what they say?

06:44.025 --> 06:45.558
Family first right.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.461
Oh wow, that's, that's great.

06:48.463 --> 06:52.765
Look, put your shirt on
and get to work please.

06:52.767 --> 06:56.035
Murph.

06:57.672 --> 06:59.255
What's shaking, little sexy?

06:59.256 --> 07:00.839
Everything, I don't know
if it's 'cause I'm hungover

07:00.842 --> 07:02.475
or the DT's.

07:02.477 --> 07:04.544
Oh god, girl, the tequila
you gave me last night

07:04.546 --> 07:05.745
really put me in a situation.

07:05.747 --> 07:06.879
Oh do tell.

07:06.881 --> 07:09.816
Let's just say I had to
make a ninja like exit.

07:09.818 --> 07:11.184
Uh so who's the lucky girl?

07:11.186 --> 07:12.718
Guy.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.787
Tim, you met my
flavor of the week.

07:14.789 --> 07:16.556
Oh, I think I need to get
you to start spreading your...

07:16.558 --> 07:17.223
Watch it.

07:17.225 --> 07:18.925
Horizons.

07:18.927 --> 07:20.844
Okay check it.

07:20.845 --> 07:22.762
Old friend from school,
just moved back to town.

07:22.764 --> 07:23.963
She's hot, right?

07:23.965 --> 07:27.200
Uh, she's too
blonde, too blonde.

07:27.202 --> 07:28.868
You really need to
lower your standards.

07:28.870 --> 07:30.837
Uh, I'm gonna be a
professional bar wench

07:30.839 --> 07:32.638
for the foreseeable future.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.841
Yeah, you know, I've compromised
everything in my sad life

07:34.843 --> 07:37.009
so I'm not going to
compromise on my dream girl.

07:37.011 --> 07:39.178
She's out there somewhere.

07:39.180 --> 07:41.781
What about that cute little
brunette you were seeing?

07:41.783 --> 07:43.983
Her vagina smelt
like breath mints.

07:45.220 --> 07:46.252
What?

07:46.254 --> 07:47.854
Landon! Ice! Now!

07:49.591 --> 07:51.224
Breath mints, really?

07:51.226 --> 07:55.261
It's better than the sweaty
sausage wallet, am I right?

07:55.263 --> 07:57.129
Hello Landon.

07:57.131 --> 07:59.999
Uh, ugh Nic put on a shirt.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.535
You are boner repellent,
you know that?

08:02.537 --> 08:03.903
It's like your superpower.

08:03.905 --> 08:05.838
Boner repellent.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.073
LeighAnne just say the word.

08:07.075 --> 08:08.075
Balls.

08:09.577 --> 08:11.878
And we're open people,
let's stop playing grab ass.

08:11.880 --> 08:12.945
Nice shot.

08:12.947 --> 08:13.947
Why thank you.

09:10.004 --> 09:12.305
Chug, chug, chug, chug.

09:12.307 --> 09:14.006
Chug, chug, chug.

09:22.350 --> 09:23.950
Are those our tequila shots?

09:23.952 --> 09:25.084
Yeah.

09:25.086 --> 09:28.187
You drinking to
celebrate or to forget?

09:28.189 --> 09:30.156
Celebrating, I think.

09:38.032 --> 09:40.132
Oh I pity the groom.

09:41.836 --> 09:43.869
So how's my girl tonight?

09:43.871 --> 09:46.005
Living the dream, Terence.

09:47.375 --> 09:50.009
Hey what's the chance of you
coming home with me tonight?

09:50.011 --> 09:53.779
I just gave myself a
new porn star trim.

09:53.781 --> 09:58.017
Oh Jesus Terence, I've
already puked once today.

10:01.856 --> 10:03.322
Here you go guys.

10:04.258 --> 10:05.791
Oh yeah.

10:05.793 --> 10:07.193
- And your extra.
- Oh that one's for you girl.

10:07.195 --> 10:09.061
Hell yeah it is, cheers.

10:09.063 --> 10:10.830
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.067
So about that bench.

10:15.069 --> 10:17.370
Yeah back to my bench press.

10:19.307 --> 10:22.141
You're old enough, it's okay.

10:26.381 --> 10:27.847
Another sack of hormones

10:27.849 --> 10:29.248
determined to take
you home tonight?

10:29.250 --> 10:31.250
Bring on the
douchiest of the douches

10:31.252 --> 10:32.184
as long as he tips.

10:32.186 --> 10:35.021
Be careful what you wish for.

10:35.023 --> 10:38.090
Hey, check her, she's hot right?

10:39.060 --> 10:41.027
Yeah like too hot.

10:41.029 --> 10:44.930
There's no help for
you, do you know that?

10:48.903 --> 10:49.935
Excuse me.

10:52.106 --> 10:53.839
I need this table.

10:55.043 --> 10:57.343
Need's a strong word bro.

10:59.013 --> 11:01.347
Oh so we are negotiating now?

11:06.187 --> 11:08.154
Look by the way,
it's a little bit early

11:08.156 --> 11:09.922
for you to be putting
on the fake tipsy.

11:09.924 --> 11:12.324
If you're not careful you're
gonna be fake drunk by 11.

11:12.326 --> 11:14.026
Those guys will be gone by 11.

11:14.028 --> 11:15.194
The strip club will be calling.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.796
Maybe earlier.

11:21.369 --> 11:22.902
Jackpot.

11:22.904 --> 11:24.170
Promise you won't judge.

11:24.172 --> 11:26.338
Look at me, I have
no room to judge.

11:26.340 --> 11:29.875
Time to make some
money, here you go.

11:31.746 --> 11:33.179
Good?

11:33.181 --> 11:34.180
Yeah, generally whoreish
but yeah it's great.

11:34.182 --> 11:36.115
Just the way I like it.

11:47.462 --> 11:48.294
Hi there honey.

11:48.296 --> 11:49.762
What can I get you?

11:49.764 --> 11:51.163
Yeah, I'll have a vodka martini.

11:51.165 --> 11:52.398
Up with no olives.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.033
Sure thing.

11:54.035 --> 11:55.201
Today, please.

12:07.348 --> 12:08.848
What'd you need cupcake?

12:08.850 --> 12:11.450
Martini straight up, no olives

12:11.452 --> 12:13.085
says the dick who's
too good to be here.

12:13.087 --> 12:14.220
Yeah is he giving trouble?

12:14.222 --> 12:16.222
No he's just being an asshole.

12:16.224 --> 12:18.758
Well he looks corporate,
probably drives a Porsche,

12:18.760 --> 12:20.126
most likely meeting some
schlub here to sucker

12:20.128 --> 12:21.794
him into one of those
pyramid schemes.

12:21.796 --> 12:23.429
You know, taking from the poor,
making his rich ass richer.

12:23.431 --> 12:25.498
You know insurance on a Porsche
is very expensive LeighAnne.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.500
You know if I didn't
know you'd quit school

12:27.502 --> 12:30.035
I would say you got
a degree in bullshit.

12:31.272 --> 12:33.072
So hey, I never asked
you, what does your,

12:33.074 --> 12:35.508
your dream girl
look like anyway?

12:35.510 --> 12:37.476
Well she's petite,
well proportioned,

12:37.478 --> 12:40.479
preferably a dancer, dark hair,
dark eyes, dark complexion,

12:40.481 --> 12:43.115
dark everything but
most importantly...

12:43.117 --> 12:45.251
Can I get a drink over here?

12:49.023 --> 12:52.158
Okay and this is
where I leave you.

12:55.830 --> 12:57.897
One martini, enjoy.

12:57.899 --> 13:01.167
Check back with me every
five minutes, is that clear?

13:01.169 --> 13:02.334
Sure thing.

13:03.871 --> 13:07.339
Hey, I'm not joking
lady, every five minutes.

13:09.877 --> 13:14.280
I would let go of my arm,
before you piss him off.

13:25.326 --> 13:26.592
I dabbled in the
arts for a while,

13:26.594 --> 13:28.961
sculpting, composing,
you know shit like that,

13:28.963 --> 13:31.197
but bartending just, you know,
kind of fit my lifestyle.

13:31.199 --> 13:33.332
Staying out late,
making new friends,

13:33.334 --> 13:35.167
meeting beautiful women.

13:35.169 --> 13:37.536
That's fantastic, can I
have a drink now please.

13:37.538 --> 13:41.207
God, of course, right,
what can I get for you?

13:41.209 --> 13:43.309
Whatever you dropped on
the floor looked pretty good.

13:43.311 --> 13:45.911
A martini, very high brow.

13:50.351 --> 13:53.319
Well hello young lady,
you snuck in on me.

13:53.321 --> 13:55.087
Do you happen to
have your ID on you?

13:55.089 --> 13:56.055
Murph.

13:56.057 --> 13:58.324
Ah business is business Nic.

13:58.326 --> 14:00.025
Don't wanna be fined.

14:00.027 --> 14:01.227
Excuse me.

14:01.229 --> 14:02.229
Thank you.

14:03.364 --> 14:06.098
Pleasure to meet you
Brooke, I'm Murphy.

14:06.100 --> 14:09.635
I hope you have a
wonderful night, carry on.

14:11.873 --> 14:14.573
Brooke, that's my favorite name.

14:16.477 --> 14:19.245
Another martini for
douchebag Mr. Moneybags.

14:19.247 --> 14:22.081
Just say the word
and I'll kick his ass.

14:22.083 --> 14:23.949
Nic, I need some more tequila,

14:23.951 --> 14:25.618
these bridesmaids
are insatiable.

14:25.620 --> 14:27.353
Landon, will you
wait your turn please?

14:27.355 --> 14:29.388
Oh I'm sorry I
don't speak skank,

14:29.390 --> 14:31.290
could you say that for
me in English please.

14:31.292 --> 14:32.358
Oh it's on.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.225
You son of a bitch.

14:33.227 --> 14:34.059
Get over here.

14:34.061 --> 14:35.061
Oh shit!

14:36.364 --> 14:37.364
You pig.

14:40.067 --> 14:41.333
You're dead!

14:41.335 --> 14:44.570
Excuse me children, we
have paying customers.

14:44.572 --> 14:45.938
Can we do this after hours?

14:45.940 --> 14:46.572
She started it.

14:46.574 --> 14:48.307
Come on bring it on.

14:48.309 --> 14:50.576
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Landon tequila.

14:50.578 --> 14:53.646
- Thank you.
- LeighAnne, martini.

14:53.648 --> 14:54.914
What?

14:54.916 --> 14:56.415
Alright go, go.

14:57.251 --> 14:58.250
What?

14:58.252 --> 15:00.219
I'm, I'm just impressed.

15:00.221 --> 15:01.954
Great.

15:01.955 --> 15:03.688
Can't I just one time,
pay you a compliment.

15:03.691 --> 15:05.124
Look can this wait
until after hours,

15:05.126 --> 15:07.693
I've got a lot of drinks
to make right now.

15:07.695 --> 15:08.695
Yeah.

15:21.275 --> 15:23.242
- Is that the owner?
- Yes.

15:23.244 --> 15:26.278
Pretty ballsy thing
to say to your boss.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.447
Yeah well, he also
happened to knock up my mom.

15:28.449 --> 15:29.615
And then promptly
disappear after that

15:29.617 --> 15:31.317
until my 26th birthday so.

15:31.319 --> 15:32.451
That was your father.

15:32.453 --> 15:34.153
Subject change.

15:34.155 --> 15:35.521
So, would you like
another drink?

15:35.523 --> 15:37.556
I don't know if I should.

15:37.558 --> 15:40.125
Oh right, it must
be a school night huh.

15:40.127 --> 15:41.360
A school night?

15:41.362 --> 15:43.996
Yeah girl, 'cause
you got so much class.

15:43.998 --> 15:46.098
Your martini's suck,
give me something else.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.099
What'll it be.

15:47.101 --> 15:48.267
Surprise me.

15:48.269 --> 15:49.535
In order to do that

15:49.537 --> 15:51.370
I'd probably have to take
you back to my place.

15:51.372 --> 15:53.272
That's a little too
forward for me, lady.

15:53.274 --> 15:54.440
Oh come on, it was a joke.

15:54.442 --> 15:56.709
You're not from around
these parts are you?

15:56.711 --> 15:59.144
These parts, no.

15:59.146 --> 16:02.381
Should I go back to that
thar place I came from.

16:02.383 --> 16:04.216
Uh, probably be for the best.

16:04.218 --> 16:05.551
Please elaborate.

16:05.553 --> 16:07.586
Well the Soggy Weasel's
known for its cheap drinks

16:07.588 --> 16:08.754
and its loose women.

16:08.756 --> 16:10.389
How do you know I'm not cheap?

16:10.391 --> 16:11.423
Loose.

16:11.425 --> 16:12.358
Whatever.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.559
So what do you do?

16:13.561 --> 16:15.127
Guess.

16:15.129 --> 16:16.495
You're a dancer?

16:16.497 --> 16:18.330
Corporate liaison.

16:18.332 --> 16:19.465
Company car, insurance.

16:19.467 --> 16:20.299
Whole nine.

16:20.301 --> 16:21.784
That's pretty sweet.

16:21.785 --> 16:23.268
It depends on your perspective.

16:23.270 --> 16:24.470
How so?

16:24.472 --> 16:25.704
What time do you
get up in the morning?

16:25.706 --> 16:27.006
5:00 p.m..

16:27.008 --> 16:28.073
6:00 a.m..

16:29.076 --> 16:30.476
What's your take home pay?

16:30.478 --> 16:31.610
Like 1,600.

16:31.612 --> 16:32.444
A week?

16:32.446 --> 16:33.779
A month.

16:33.781 --> 16:35.447
How about you?

16:35.449 --> 16:39.284
More than 1,600 but
we have a dress code.

16:39.286 --> 16:40.386
Oh that sucks.

16:40.388 --> 16:42.121
Yeah tell me about it.

16:42.123 --> 16:44.757
Our lot always took a lot
of pride in our appearance.

16:44.759 --> 16:46.525
This is Terence.

16:46.527 --> 16:49.061
He used to work for
a company called R&P.

16:49.063 --> 16:50.295
The shaving cream guys?

16:50.297 --> 16:51.430
They're a bunch of bastards,

16:51.432 --> 16:53.799
suckered me into
early retirement.

16:53.801 --> 16:56.468
Said I had a drinking problem.

16:56.470 --> 16:58.604
That's what I'm
talking about. Terence

16:58.606 --> 17:01.040
may or may not have an
alleged drinking problem

17:01.042 --> 17:03.609
and yet he gets
early retirement.

17:03.611 --> 17:05.210
Living the dream.

17:05.212 --> 17:06.478
Enough of this idle chit chat.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.180
I wanna know more about you.

17:08.182 --> 17:09.481
So what are your hopes, your
dreams, your aspirations?

17:09.483 --> 17:11.215
One more drink.

17:11.218 --> 17:12.584
Then I have to go.

17:19.627 --> 17:20.792
What's in this?

17:20.795 --> 17:21.795
Vodka.

17:23.531 --> 17:26.098
It just tastes strong.

17:26.099 --> 17:28.233
I'll tell the bartender
to take it easy.

17:30.471 --> 17:31.437
Hey who wants another?

17:31.439 --> 17:32.471
Yes.

17:32.473 --> 17:33.589
Cool.

17:33.590 --> 17:34.706
I think I've had
enough for a while.

17:34.708 --> 17:36.708
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's crazy talk.

17:36.710 --> 17:39.445
Michelle, come on, tell
her that's crazy talk.

17:39.447 --> 17:40.846
I think my friend here

17:40.848 --> 17:43.849
wants to make sure that she
has all her wits about her.

17:43.851 --> 17:47.419
Otherwise she'll have an
excuse to act inappropriately.

17:48.656 --> 17:50.522
When did I become the bad guy?

17:50.524 --> 17:52.858
Ladies, do not
listen to this man.

17:52.860 --> 17:54.526
Don't trust this man.

17:56.797 --> 17:59.465
Do you know what it's
like to realize that

17:59.467 --> 18:03.569
after this night you will be
sleeping with the same person,

18:03.571 --> 18:06.572
the same five foot
four stockbroker

18:06.574 --> 18:10.342
with chronic, but it's
genetic so you can't judge me,

18:10.344 --> 18:13.512
halitosis, for the
rest of your life.

18:13.514 --> 18:14.613
No idea.

18:17.284 --> 18:20.319
The truth is Landon,
can I call you Landon.

18:20.321 --> 18:21.553
Sure, yeah.

18:21.555 --> 18:23.522
The truth is some
of us bridesmaids

18:23.524 --> 18:26.525
aren't completely happy
with Mr. Stockbroker.

18:26.527 --> 18:29.528
Some of us are wondering why
Mr. Corporate Banker Bigshot

18:29.530 --> 18:32.464
comes home late every night.

18:32.466 --> 18:34.800
And some of us, not
naming names here,

18:34.802 --> 18:38.403
know that you, yes you,
Landon the bartender

18:38.405 --> 18:40.606
might be the best last hope of,

18:40.608 --> 18:43.142
how can I put this delicately,

18:43.144 --> 18:47.579
boning some sense into our
betrothed friend over there.

18:50.151 --> 18:51.850
I would be honored.

19:09.537 --> 19:10.936
Nic, cover me!

19:16.544 --> 19:17.709
Dammit Landon.

19:19.613 --> 19:22.414
♪ Shut this down ♪

19:22.416 --> 19:24.583
♪ Shut this down ♪

19:24.585 --> 19:28.854
♪ I'm leaving the
town, shut this down. ♪

19:32.660 --> 19:33.759
Why don't you lock the door?

19:33.761 --> 19:34.726
Lock the door?

19:34.728 --> 19:36.461
Locks in the men's room stalls,

19:36.463 --> 19:39.831
what kind of establishment
od you think this is?

19:42.336 --> 19:43.635
Yeah I trust you.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.406
It's quitting time.

19:47.408 --> 19:48.941
Closing you out, because you
don't look like you need to be

19:48.943 --> 19:50.242
having any more fun anyway.

19:50.244 --> 19:51.310
What's this?

19:51.312 --> 19:53.512
It's your check.

19:53.514 --> 19:55.480
But, I have, I have...

19:57.551 --> 20:00.786
Whoa, whoa, whoa, sit
down, stop, take it easy.

20:00.788 --> 20:03.555
I hate to break it to you,
but you're not going anywhere

20:03.557 --> 20:06.358
unless it's in a cab.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.360
Shit.

20:08.762 --> 20:11.563
Nicki, shift's up, I'm out.

20:11.565 --> 20:12.698
Hang onto these.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.966
Are these Mr. Moneybags?

20:13.968 --> 20:15.400
Yes, he's completely
wasted, total lightweight,

20:15.402 --> 20:16.635
looks like I'm
not getting a tip.

20:16.637 --> 20:18.437
Alright what do you
want me to do with him?

20:18.439 --> 20:20.339
I don't know, give him
an hour. Call him a cab.

20:20.341 --> 20:22.007
A really, really, shitty cab.

20:22.009 --> 20:24.543
I'm gonna call him the
shittiest of shittiest of cabs.

20:24.545 --> 20:26.011
And that's why I love you.

20:26.013 --> 20:27.613
I'm going to Tim's.

20:27.615 --> 20:29.948
Hey you should come,
'cause I plan to be wasted.

20:29.950 --> 20:30.950
Alright.

20:33.621 --> 20:37.389
Whoa, when did you go
all Megan Fox on me.

20:38.392 --> 20:39.258
Bye Murph.

20:39.260 --> 20:39.992
Bye sweetheart.

20:39.994 --> 20:41.627
Be safe okay.

20:41.629 --> 20:42.661
I will.

20:42.663 --> 20:43.663
Alright.

20:56.010 --> 20:57.876
Mr. Cooper?

21:01.749 --> 21:06.785
I gave you explicit instructions
to order one drink, one.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.455
And wait patiently.

21:12.326 --> 21:13.659
I'm so wasted.

21:13.661 --> 21:15.494
I'm so wasted boss.

21:17.798 --> 21:21.566
You don't seem to
have heeded my advice.

21:23.837 --> 21:26.705
Get your ass out of that chair.

21:30.077 --> 21:31.410
Please.

21:34.448 --> 21:36.915
This is unfortunate Mr. Cooper.

21:38.719 --> 21:40.786
Listen, I can't just leave work.

21:40.788 --> 21:41.853
You know what?

21:41.855 --> 21:42.821
Scratch that.

21:42.823 --> 21:44.089
I know I'm relatively beautiful

21:44.091 --> 21:45.657
but I'm sure as
hell not that lucky.

21:45.659 --> 21:47.759
So tell me, what's
going on here?

21:47.761 --> 21:51.363
I want you now,
I just can't wait.

22:05.646 --> 22:09.481
Celebrating a bit prematurely
aren't we Mr. Cooper?

22:09.483 --> 22:10.349
No.

22:10.351 --> 22:11.783
One drink, martini.

22:13.020 --> 22:14.986
Okay, two drinks, two drinks.

22:14.988 --> 22:16.822
I do not care.

22:16.824 --> 22:18.657
But seeing as how
we are paying you

22:18.659 --> 22:20.892
a more than significant
sum of money

22:20.894 --> 22:25.130
I would appreciate some
semblance of professionalism.

22:25.132 --> 22:28.834
The waitress.

22:28.836 --> 22:30.068
Yes this waitress.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.676
You can do this Mr. Cooper.

22:37.678 --> 22:38.678
My keys.

22:39.880 --> 22:43.048
A sound judgment, I
wouldn't recommend driving.

22:43.050 --> 22:44.050
My keys.

22:44.818 --> 22:46.952
God was on the key chain.

22:49.156 --> 22:50.856
God is everywhere Mr. Cooper.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.394
The flash disk is God.

23:00.501 --> 23:01.501
I see.

23:03.637 --> 23:05.837
And this waitress, she was...

23:07.174 --> 23:10.642
Dark haired, five foot
two, great ass, decent rack.

23:10.644 --> 23:11.877
Look it's now or never.

23:11.879 --> 23:15.113
I need you to leave
with me right now.

23:16.517 --> 23:19.684
I'd do it girl,
like they say, YOLO.

23:22.923 --> 23:25.123
Mr. Cooper, how
much are we paying you

23:25.125 --> 23:27.426
for this little
corporate transgression?

23:27.428 --> 23:31.029
Uh, a shit ton.

23:32.132 --> 23:34.466
That's probably the
best way to put it.

23:34.468 --> 23:39.004
Monetarily speaking it comes
out to about $26.8 million.

23:40.474 --> 23:41.973
Tax free am I correct?

23:41.975 --> 23:44.943
I guess so.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.778
How much do you think
it's going to cost

23:46.780 --> 23:48.847
to cover up your murder?

23:48.849 --> 23:53.051
To sweep something this
nefarious under the rug?

23:53.053 --> 23:54.786
What?

23:54.788 --> 23:58.957
I'll give you a hint, it's
much less then $26.8 million.

24:00.027 --> 24:02.561
Some might even say
a shit ton less.

24:02.563 --> 24:04.996
You've just negotiated
yourself out of the deal.

24:06.900 --> 24:07.900
Fuck!

24:24.918 --> 24:26.117
You the groom?

24:26.987 --> 24:28.987
No, I just work here.

24:30.157 --> 24:32.057
Oh well that's good.

24:33.827 --> 24:36.895
You look too young
to get tied down.

24:41.869 --> 24:43.034
Then again.

24:45.939 --> 24:47.906
Look, I have a job and
I'm never gonna get anywhere

24:47.908 --> 24:50.108
if I just blow that off for
every unbelievably witty,

24:50.110 --> 24:51.776
slightly soul crushingly
beautiful dream girl

24:51.778 --> 24:54.045
that walks in off the street.

25:05.726 --> 25:08.059
So I woke up naked, upside-down

25:08.061 --> 25:10.161
with a hairbrush up
my ass, true story.

25:10.163 --> 25:12.531
And my friend is screaming

25:12.533 --> 25:14.013
because he's handcuffed
to the toilet.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.773
What can I do for you sir?

25:21.775 --> 25:24.042
Can I have a Roy Rogers?

25:24.044 --> 25:25.176
A Roy Rogers?

25:25.979 --> 25:26.979
Yeah, okay.

25:27.881 --> 25:29.648
And that would be a...

25:29.650 --> 25:30.849
Cola and grenadine.

25:30.851 --> 25:32.050
Cherry cola.

25:32.052 --> 25:34.586
Extra cherries please.

25:34.588 --> 25:35.654
Certainly.

25:44.898 --> 25:47.632
Dammit Nic listen, I like you.

25:48.735 --> 25:50.001
There's a lot of shit
going on in this bar

25:50.003 --> 25:52.003
that you have no idea about.

25:52.005 --> 25:55.974
So I'm asking you for your
own safety and well being.

25:55.976 --> 25:58.176
Get me out of this bar.

25:58.178 --> 26:00.912
You know there was a
time not too long ago

26:00.914 --> 26:02.180
where I would have said yes,

26:02.182 --> 26:03.815
but how am I ever gonna
move up in this world

26:03.817 --> 26:05.183
with that sort of attitude.

26:05.185 --> 26:08.253
Hear hear, top
shelf to celebrate.

26:11.024 --> 26:13.024
You know what this generation's
workforce is lacking?

26:13.026 --> 26:14.593
Loyalty.

26:14.595 --> 26:16.094
That's what big companies
are looking for,

26:16.096 --> 26:17.796
it starts right now.

26:17.798 --> 26:19.230
No more staying out late, no
more drinking on Monday's,

26:19.232 --> 26:22.100
no more skipping out on
work for a random triste.

26:22.102 --> 26:25.837
And if you can't respect
that, then I guess.

26:33.614 --> 26:35.380
Never, not even once.

26:36.283 --> 26:38.350
Not with him.

26:38.352 --> 26:40.986
I think it's your body
that's telling your brain

26:40.988 --> 26:42.320
something it doesn't want to...

26:42.322 --> 26:46.024
Oh my god.

26:46.026 --> 26:47.026
Oh Jesus.

26:48.128 --> 26:49.861
- What Nicki?
- I think I need to quit.

26:49.863 --> 26:50.829
Really?

26:50.831 --> 26:51.796
Why now?

26:51.798 --> 26:53.949
Now.

26:53.950 --> 26:56.101
No benefits, terrible wages,
no opportunity for growth.

26:56.103 --> 26:59.104
A culture that encourages
laziness and personal stagnation,

26:59.106 --> 27:03.008
I mean come on, this bar
has cost me my dream girl

27:03.010 --> 27:08.146
and now the bartender's off
getting herpes from bridezilla.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.414
Sorry, no offense.

27:10.317 --> 27:12.017
We'll talk about

27:12.019 --> 27:15.153
your fictional romantic
relationships later, okay?

27:15.155 --> 27:18.256
Right now, I'll go find Landon.

27:18.258 --> 27:21.159
Okay, don't touch me, okay.

27:21.161 --> 27:22.161
What?

27:23.730 --> 27:25.163
You're a lesbian?

27:26.700 --> 27:31.369
Oh and here I thought I was
hiding it this whole time.

27:32.105 --> 27:33.105
Well shit.

27:39.312 --> 27:41.146
Goddammit Landon.

27:46.319 --> 27:50.255
Alright kid, I hope you
got your rocks, off.

27:54.294 --> 27:57.429
Good God. Jesus
Christ what happened?

27:59.099 --> 28:00.965
I didn't even know her name.

28:00.967 --> 28:03.702
I'll be right back, don't move.

28:03.704 --> 28:06.871
Murphy, Murphy
don't leave me here.

28:09.142 --> 28:11.076
Maybe you're just not
wired for it, you know.

28:11.078 --> 28:14.045
Have you ever thought about
batting for the other team?

28:14.047 --> 28:15.380
What's it like?

28:15.382 --> 28:17.782
Recently, pretty minty.

28:17.784 --> 28:18.783
- Nicki.
- Ow.

28:18.785 --> 28:21.419
You need to go out of here now.

28:21.421 --> 28:23.088
Yeah she's kind of lame.

28:23.090 --> 28:25.290
No, I mean leave, out the back.

28:25.292 --> 28:26.725
What's going on?

28:26.727 --> 28:28.893
Just once, do what
I ask you to do.

28:31.364 --> 28:34.999
I assume you're the proprietor
of this fine establishment?

28:35.001 --> 28:37.902
Let's talk about
what happens next.

28:50.450 --> 28:53.818
Alright everybody, we
are closed for business.

28:53.820 --> 28:55.153
I don't care if you go home,

28:55.155 --> 28:56.821
but you can't stay here.

28:56.823 --> 29:00.925
Thank you all very much,
please we need you to leave.

29:00.927 --> 29:01.927
Take care.

29:02.996 --> 29:04.162
Where's Megan?

29:04.164 --> 29:07.465
She probably left
with the bartender.

29:07.467 --> 29:08.399
Do you want to fill me in on

29:08.401 --> 29:09.868
what the hell's going on here?

29:09.870 --> 29:12.270
Nicki please, just
stand behind the bar

29:12.272 --> 29:14.005
and shut your mouth.

29:15.275 --> 29:18.777
Thank you everybody.
Please be safe.

29:31.324 --> 29:33.124
What the hell is this?

29:33.126 --> 29:35.293
I don't just blindly
follow orders

29:35.295 --> 29:37.796
like the rest of these lemings.

29:37.798 --> 29:39.297
I'm too damn old.

29:40.100 --> 29:41.466
Goddammit.

29:41.468 --> 29:44.002
Terence, put a lid on it.

29:45.005 --> 29:46.304
Terence Walker?

29:48.175 --> 29:50.275
Who the hell are you?

29:50.277 --> 29:53.812
Christian Boland,
pleased to meet you.

29:53.814 --> 29:56.881
You're a legend. We
still tell stories

29:56.883 --> 29:59.551
around the water cooler about
your exploits in the 80's.

29:59.553 --> 30:03.555
I for one was shocked when
Rappaport and Progatto

30:03.557 --> 30:06.090
pushed you ont. What was
the official reasoning?

30:06.092 --> 30:07.458
Drinking problem?

30:07.460 --> 30:09.227
Well that just
reeks of cronyism.

30:09.229 --> 30:12.564
Out with the old to make way
for some CEO's pipsqueak son,

30:12.566 --> 30:14.199
am I right?

30:14.201 --> 30:15.300
You work for R&P?

30:15.302 --> 30:16.267
Indeed.

30:16.269 --> 30:18.069
Who the hell are you?

30:18.071 --> 30:21.239
I thought we covered
that, Christian Boland.

30:21.241 --> 30:23.975
Special Acquisitions Department.

30:25.178 --> 30:29.380
Now, I understand this is
an extreme inconvenience,

30:29.382 --> 30:31.549
but I do have some
business to discuss

30:31.551 --> 30:33.585
with this gentleman, so I'm
going to have to ask you

30:33.587 --> 30:35.854
to do your drinking
elsewhere this evening.

30:35.856 --> 30:38.223
And I assume I can trust your
discretion on the matter,

30:38.225 --> 30:41.125
seeing as how you should
still be under contract

30:41.127 --> 30:45.330
and whistle blowers can't
be tolerated, am I right?

30:45.332 --> 30:46.865
Of course, Mr...

30:49.336 --> 30:50.336
Boland.

30:51.404 --> 30:53.238
For the third time.

31:07.487 --> 31:10.955
It's a nice independent
place you have here,

31:10.957 --> 31:13.925
one of the best,
I appreciate that.

31:18.298 --> 31:22.333
Men's bathroom, second
stall, bring them here.

31:22.335 --> 31:23.434
Make sure we're alone.

31:23.436 --> 31:25.270
Excuse me, jackass.

31:25.272 --> 31:27.972
Why the hell are we
all listening to you?

31:27.974 --> 31:29.641
Oh yeah that.

31:34.481 --> 31:37.348
I know, I know, it's
a crude show of force,

31:37.350 --> 31:40.485
but it is effective,
you have to admit.

31:42.022 --> 31:44.389
You can put your hands down.

31:46.226 --> 31:48.259
This one has already noticed

31:48.261 --> 31:51.930
that I have taken the liberty
of shutting down cell service.

31:51.932 --> 31:53.965
Now I know you're the bartender.

31:53.967 --> 31:58.336
I know you're the owner of
this delightful establishment.

31:58.338 --> 32:02.307
And this young man was receiving
fellatio from a bride to be

32:02.309 --> 32:05.276
in a bathroom stall,
up high buddy.

32:07.480 --> 32:10.415
Oh you're still sore
at me for interrupting,

32:10.417 --> 32:13.051
I understand, it
was a dick move.

32:13.053 --> 32:14.519
Sorry about that.

32:15.422 --> 32:19.624
So that leaves me with
one unanswered question,

32:19.626 --> 32:21.526
where is the waitress?

32:25.298 --> 32:29.200
Dark hair, five foot two,
great ass, decent rack,

32:29.202 --> 32:30.568
so I've been told.

32:32.672 --> 32:33.672
No one?

32:35.141 --> 32:38.443
Do you know why I didn't
kill you in the bathroom?

32:38.445 --> 32:41.713
Because you look like
a reasonable man.

32:41.715 --> 32:45.717
Now, you see, there's no
need for bloodshed here.

32:47.454 --> 32:49.587
All I care about
is the bottom line.

32:49.589 --> 32:53.358
If it's cheaper for
me to pay you off

32:53.360 --> 32:57.362
than to cover up your
murder, everybody wins.

32:58.365 --> 33:01.699
As long as you
know where she is.

33:01.701 --> 33:03.468
I, I don't know.

33:09.142 --> 33:10.142
Bummer.

33:11.111 --> 33:12.643
- Oh my god!
- Landon.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.714
You see, he didn't do the math.

33:18.318 --> 33:21.753
With three of you here, I
still have two more chances

33:21.755 --> 33:23.421
to get what I want.

33:26.259 --> 33:28.626
So what's it gonna be big guy?

33:30.463 --> 33:33.664
A big old fat paycheck
or a bullet to the brain?

33:33.666 --> 33:36.367
Like I'd tell you anything.

33:38.738 --> 33:40.405
Dammit stop, alright.

33:40.407 --> 33:42.473
I don't know where's she's at.

33:42.475 --> 33:44.042
I don't know anything.

33:44.044 --> 33:45.510
I've struck a nerve.

33:47.580 --> 33:49.447
He cares about you.

33:50.617 --> 33:53.317
Doesn't that make you feel good.

33:53.319 --> 33:55.386
Stop, please.

33:55.388 --> 33:56.388
Don't.

33:57.657 --> 33:59.090
I'll give you an address,

33:59.092 --> 34:00.358
I'll tell you whatever
you want to know.

34:00.360 --> 34:01.592
Just stop.

34:01.594 --> 34:04.128
She's not at home,
you're not gonna find her.

34:04.130 --> 34:06.264
Oh I'll find her.

34:06.266 --> 34:09.367
She has something
that belongs to me.

34:09.369 --> 34:12.437
A USB drive on a
dead man's keychain.

34:15.542 --> 34:18.476
And you know where
she is, don't you?

34:19.446 --> 34:22.447
Let go of me.

34:22.449 --> 34:24.348
I found her roaming
around in the back.

34:24.350 --> 34:25.449
The more the merrier.

34:25.452 --> 34:27.452
Get your hands
off me you asshole.

34:27.454 --> 34:30.855
Today is my birthday and
this one got me drunk.

34:30.857 --> 34:34.458
Is that right?

34:34.460 --> 34:36.226
How uncouth.

34:36.228 --> 34:37.462
Yeah, bitch.

34:38.531 --> 34:41.264
You know, to think I
almost took her home.

34:41.266 --> 34:42.533
I mean I don't
even swing that way

34:42.534 --> 34:44.402
but I thought, what
the hell, right.

34:44.404 --> 34:47.505
But that's it,
experimental phase is over.

34:47.507 --> 34:49.474
I'm on a dick only
diet from here on out

34:49.476 --> 34:50.775
and that's, that's a good thing.

34:50.777 --> 34:53.578
'Cause you're a dick,
and you're a dick

34:53.580 --> 34:54.812
and you're a...

34:58.751 --> 34:59.617
Woo!

34:59.619 --> 35:01.119
Man remind me not to...

35:01.121 --> 35:02.121
Everybody drop your...

35:04.557 --> 35:05.523
God.

35:05.525 --> 35:06.457
It's official I quit.

35:06.459 --> 35:08.593
Guess what, I do too.

35:08.595 --> 35:09.727
Follow me.

35:11.197 --> 35:12.163
Impressive kid.

35:12.165 --> 35:14.132
Self defense classes.

35:14.134 --> 35:15.533
YouTube!

35:18.638 --> 35:21.639
Jesus Nicki, do you ever
mop the floors in here?

35:21.641 --> 35:23.741
Oh my god, geez, focus.

35:44.564 --> 35:46.397
You're making this
whole acquisition

35:46.399 --> 35:50.535
significantly more expensive
than it needs to be.

35:56.543 --> 35:58.209
I hate to speak for corporate,

35:58.211 --> 36:01.445
but our shareholders
are gonna be pissed.

36:14.494 --> 36:15.660
Holy shit.

36:15.662 --> 36:17.695
He was a bad guy right?

36:29.509 --> 36:32.310
Man I was not
expecting this tonight.

36:32.312 --> 36:34.245
But I'm having
fun, how about you?

36:34.247 --> 36:36.247
I'll get back to you!

36:38.218 --> 36:39.417
Shit.

36:39.419 --> 36:40.351
What?

36:40.353 --> 36:41.652
I left the keys in the bar.

36:41.654 --> 36:42.486
I'll just have to...

36:42.488 --> 36:45.439
Break some shit?

36:45.440 --> 36:48.391
No, get the spare key that
I keep underneath the bumper.

36:49.729 --> 36:50.628
I'm making an assumption
based on your training

36:50.630 --> 36:52.263
that you work for PNR?

36:52.265 --> 36:54.385
I didn't know they were
hiring out of high school now.

36:54.667 --> 36:57.602
I'm new, how am I doing?

36:57.604 --> 36:58.903
Not bad for a girl.

36:58.905 --> 37:01.572
Wanna get together for
Chinese after this?

37:01.574 --> 37:03.908
Maybe we can talk about it?

37:13.019 --> 37:14.452
Got it.

37:14.454 --> 37:17.288
Brooke's coming
and she's got a gun.

37:18.658 --> 37:21.726
You have the worst
taste in women.

37:33.773 --> 37:35.940
I need eyes on a
white Toyota Camry,

37:35.942 --> 37:41.012
license plate 283 EXW,
heading west on Starry Avenue.

37:41.814 --> 37:44.482
Let me know where they're going.

37:58.765 --> 38:00.398
Alright cell phone check.

38:00.400 --> 38:01.365
Mine's still out.

38:01.367 --> 38:02.600
Dammit.

38:02.602 --> 38:04.185
These guys have some
serious resources.

38:04.186 --> 38:05.769
Okay, that's it, end of story,
we're going to the cops.

38:05.772 --> 38:06.971
We have to get LeighAnne,

38:06.973 --> 38:08.372
they think she
has the USB drive.

38:08.374 --> 38:09.607
Doesn't she?

38:09.609 --> 38:12.043
Nicki, how the hell
did you get that?

38:12.045 --> 38:13.644
LeighAnne, she pulled
it off of Mr. Moneybags,

38:13.646 --> 38:15.379
I was supposed to
call him a cab.

38:15.381 --> 38:16.614
For Christ sake,

38:16.616 --> 38:17.682
do you have any idea
what's on that thing?

38:17.683 --> 38:18.749
I don't know, hipster
dude's porn collection?

38:18.751 --> 38:20.017
How the hell should I know?

38:20.019 --> 38:21.819
Well maybe we should
just give it to him?

38:21.821 --> 38:24.088
No, no, and get a
bullet through our brain

38:24.090 --> 38:25.723
for our trouble? No thank you.

38:25.725 --> 38:27.358
That's probably the only
thing that's keeping us alive,

38:27.360 --> 38:29.794
and god help LeighAnne
if they find her.

38:29.796 --> 38:30.761
She's toast.

38:30.763 --> 38:33.331
Unless we get to her first.

38:33.333 --> 38:35.766
She's probably out partying.

38:35.768 --> 38:37.635
She's dating that guy Tim?

38:37.637 --> 38:39.670
Oh he's just the
flavor of the week.

38:39.672 --> 38:41.505
What flavor is that, gonorrhea?

38:41.507 --> 38:44.108
Well I know where
Mr. Gonorrhea lives.

38:54.420 --> 38:56.587
Sir, we've searched the premises

38:56.589 --> 39:01.425
and there's no sign of the
bartender or the PNR operative.

39:03.363 --> 39:04.428
Thank you.

39:06.032 --> 39:08.766
I have a question for the group.

39:11.437 --> 39:13.838
Could any of you
please explain to me,

39:13.840 --> 39:17.942
how you people got your
asses handed to you

39:17.944 --> 39:22.780
by a five foot tall
Chun-Li with a microwave?

39:31.557 --> 39:32.890
I hate to speak for corporate,

39:32.892 --> 39:34.558
but I don't think any of you

39:34.560 --> 39:38.729
are getting your Christmas
fruitcakes this year.

39:51.944 --> 39:53.144
Hello sir.

39:53.146 --> 39:55.546
I believe we had
pushback on the deal.

39:55.548 --> 39:56.914
PNR knew we were coming, sir.

39:56.916 --> 39:58.015
They had an operative waiting.

39:58.017 --> 39:59.550
One operative?

39:59.552 --> 40:01.719
I'm taking care of it, sir.

40:01.721 --> 40:03.988
Good, because I have
a meeting in the morning

40:03.990 --> 40:05.189
with the shareholders

40:05.191 --> 40:07.091
and if that acquisition
hasn't gone through

40:07.093 --> 40:11.595
then I will be pushing for
very severe downsizing.

40:11.597 --> 40:12.797
Do you understand?

40:12.799 --> 40:13.798
I understand sir.

40:13.800 --> 40:15.499
Do you know where the drive is?

40:15.501 --> 40:17.868
No sir, but I know who does.

40:19.572 --> 40:21.205
And she's leading
me right to it.

40:25.077 --> 40:26.644
We have you staying
at the Brown, sir,

40:26.646 --> 40:28.712
just like you requested.

40:28.714 --> 40:31.482
Savannah, can I
ask you a question?

40:31.484 --> 40:32.817
Of course.

40:32.819 --> 40:34.885
What time were we
supposed to land?

40:34.887 --> 40:36.220
1:40 a.m..

40:36.222 --> 40:39.590
And what time did you ask
for my car to pick us up?

40:39.592 --> 40:40.624
1:30 a.m..

40:41.794 --> 40:45.062
Which just begs
the obvious question.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.067
Where is my goddamn car?

40:55.875 --> 40:59.543
Great, now I feel like
a right royal ass.

41:03.649 --> 41:06.617
Savannah, we're gonna
have to stop doing this.

41:06.619 --> 41:08.986
Buy yourself something pretty.

41:10.590 --> 41:15.025
♪ They don't have the time ♪

41:15.027 --> 41:19.530
♪ They're working
and they're fine ♪

41:20.933 --> 41:21.933
Alright do me.

41:22.635 --> 41:23.901
The lighter not...

41:28.107 --> 41:29.006
Alright we're here.

41:29.008 --> 41:29.940
What do we do now?

41:29.942 --> 41:30.941
Find LeighAnne.

41:30.943 --> 41:32.910
And get the hell out.

41:33.846 --> 41:35.613
Suck it.

41:35.615 --> 41:36.615
Suck it.

41:37.884 --> 41:38.884
Yeah.

41:40.186 --> 41:41.619
I sucked it.

41:42.855 --> 41:44.722
I sucked it good, dude.

41:45.558 --> 41:46.790
Yo.

41:47.627 --> 41:48.626
There you are.

41:48.628 --> 41:49.927
- Jesus, man.
- Yeah.

41:49.929 --> 41:51.762
You can't sneak up
on people like that.

41:51.764 --> 41:53.531
Do you guys know where
I can find LeighAnne?

41:53.533 --> 41:54.298
Anybody?

41:54.300 --> 41:56.166
Uh, well, are you a cop?

41:56.168 --> 41:58.869
Do I look like a cop?

41:58.871 --> 41:59.904
Hmm.

42:15.922 --> 42:18.756
Holy shit Nic, what the hell?

42:21.060 --> 42:22.126
What's up?

42:23.696 --> 42:24.662
I'm Tim.

42:24.664 --> 42:25.664
Hey Tim.

42:34.140 --> 42:35.973
LeighAnne, we have to
get out of here now.

42:35.975 --> 42:38.242
Dream girl and
douchebag both wanted

42:38.244 --> 42:40.611
what Mr. Moneybags has on this.

42:40.613 --> 42:42.846
LeighAnne, Landon is dead.

42:44.050 --> 42:45.649
Look Nic, I'm a little stoned

42:45.651 --> 42:47.117
and even more than
a little drunk

42:47.119 --> 42:48.686
and this shit is not funny.

42:48.688 --> 42:49.920
LeighAnne, I'm not
trying to be funny,

42:49.922 --> 42:52.072
we need to get the
hell out of here now.

42:52.073 --> 42:54.223
I'm not going anywhere until
I know what this is about.

42:54.226 --> 42:56.627
Alright, let's find out.

42:59.966 --> 43:03.601
Okay man, we've
come to a consensus

43:03.603 --> 43:07.938
and we've decided that you
do not look like a cop.

43:07.940 --> 43:11.742
You two have been no
help whatsoever. None.

43:12.778 --> 43:15.045
Not true.

43:15.046 --> 43:17.313
I'd say a good diversion is
worth its weight in hashish.

43:17.316 --> 43:19.016
Wouldn't you say?

43:19.986 --> 43:22.052
I'm sorry to break up the party,

43:22.054 --> 43:24.221
it's time we find this waitress.

43:24.223 --> 43:27.358
Oh dude, now that
looks like a cop.

43:29.929 --> 43:33.197
Is it poison
or a bomb or something?

43:33.199 --> 43:35.099
No, it's toothpaste.

43:37.036 --> 43:39.303
That's what this is all about?

43:39.305 --> 43:40.804
Apparently.

43:40.806 --> 43:42.272
Look, um, this is
gonna sound crazy

43:42.274 --> 43:43.674
but you gotta believe me.

43:43.676 --> 43:44.942
Your life is in danger. Alright?

43:44.944 --> 43:46.410
We have to get the
hell out of here.

43:46.412 --> 43:47.412
Good advice.

43:48.914 --> 43:50.414
Nic, give me the drive
and I'll take care of it.

43:50.416 --> 43:52.316
No, I've seen how you and
your people take care of things.

43:52.318 --> 43:54.284
We don't have time for this now.

43:54.286 --> 43:56.086
Boland is down the
hall and he'll kill you

43:56.088 --> 43:57.388
without a second thought.

43:57.390 --> 43:59.089
Oh wait, you're a good guy?

43:59.091 --> 44:00.057
Not exactly.

44:00.059 --> 44:02.226
But I'm all you've got.

44:03.829 --> 44:06.263
Come with me if you wanna live.

44:07.333 --> 44:08.333
Whoa.

44:09.769 --> 44:13.137
I told you, they've already
left with the drive, okay.

44:13.139 --> 44:15.105
Somehow I doubt that.

44:16.709 --> 44:20.744
Look, maybe I can call her,
get her to meet you someplace?

44:20.746 --> 44:22.846
Do I look that stupid?

44:22.848 --> 44:25.082
Actually, yeah you do.

44:31.223 --> 44:33.957
Yo, you guys cops or something?

44:33.959 --> 44:34.858
No.

44:34.860 --> 44:38.195
Good, 'cause I've got an
eight ball in my sock drawer

44:38.197 --> 44:41.065
and I may or may not have
sideswiped a Chrysler

44:41.067 --> 44:43.167
on my beer run earlier.

44:43.169 --> 44:44.234
You feel me?

44:45.137 --> 44:47.371
LeighAnne, where is she?

44:48.941 --> 44:52.176
She was here earlier
man, but she left a while ago.

44:58.084 --> 44:59.216
Come on.

44:59.218 --> 45:00.117
LeighAnne, Murphy.

45:00.119 --> 45:02.152
Leave 'em we have to go.

45:02.154 --> 45:04.955
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

45:04.957 --> 45:05.957
Go!

45:10.429 --> 45:11.862
Move your ass, Nicki.

45:11.864 --> 45:14.965
You don't get to call me that.

45:17.937 --> 45:19.269
Sachtler!

45:19.271 --> 45:20.337
Put it away.

45:25.978 --> 45:27.511
No need to make this
screw up any messier

45:27.513 --> 45:29.146
than it already is.

45:34.086 --> 45:36.253
I need a clean up crew.

45:37.423 --> 45:39.022
4218 Cresky Way.

45:41.227 --> 45:43.060
Bring your checkbook.

45:48.300 --> 45:49.433
You okay?

45:49.435 --> 45:51.502
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

45:51.504 --> 45:53.003
Where's the drive?

45:53.005 --> 45:54.204
Is that all you
give a shit about?

45:54.206 --> 45:55.939
I mean LeighAnne
and Murphy are...

45:55.941 --> 45:57.341
Safe, for now.

45:58.410 --> 46:00.077
It'll be a lot cheaper
to pay the girl off

46:00.079 --> 46:02.546
than it is to kill her.

46:02.548 --> 46:04.414
But what about Murphy?

46:04.416 --> 46:07.851
He's a serious
liability, I'm sorry.

46:09.421 --> 46:11.555
We have to go get him.

46:11.557 --> 46:13.524
I can't use company
resources to save your dad,

46:13.526 --> 46:15.425
it's against protocol.

46:16.896 --> 46:19.029
The drive's in a safe
deposit box at the bus station.

46:19.031 --> 46:20.564
I don't have the number
and I don't have the key.

46:20.566 --> 46:21.832
Murphy does.

46:22.802 --> 46:23.834
That's your story?

46:23.836 --> 46:25.169
Absolutely.

46:25.171 --> 46:27.004
And you can guarantee if
we get Murphy back safely,

46:27.006 --> 46:28.205
we'll get the drive back?

46:28.207 --> 46:29.306
Totally.

46:30.376 --> 46:32.142
Then let's go get him.

46:32.144 --> 46:33.043
How?

46:33.045 --> 46:38.182
Operator put me through
to Human Resources.

46:49.461 --> 46:50.994
Drag?

46:50.996 --> 46:52.062
Screw you.

46:54.266 --> 46:58.268
I'm trying to quit. I still
need an occasional burst

46:58.270 --> 47:01.238
of nicotine every now and then

47:01.240 --> 47:03.407
to kind of take the edge off.

47:03.409 --> 47:05.876
What are you gonna do with me?

47:05.878 --> 47:08.345
Well, whatever makes sense.

47:12.318 --> 47:15.319
It is all about
the bottom line, so

47:16.255 --> 47:20.390
if it's cheaper to keep
you alive we will do so.

47:21.994 --> 47:26.363
But given all the trauma we've
already inflicted on you,

47:26.365 --> 47:29.066
and everything you've seen,

47:29.068 --> 47:32.202
it'll probably just be
smarter to write you off

47:32.204 --> 47:33.570
as a total loss.

47:35.374 --> 47:39.343
It's a tough break, hombre,
but that's business.

47:40.946 --> 47:42.880
I own a company.

47:42.882 --> 47:45.215
And I understand business.

47:45.217 --> 47:48.352
Profits are low, I'll
water down the liquor.

47:48.354 --> 47:51.255
I sell buckets of
beer for six bucks,

47:51.257 --> 47:53.957
the beer costs me 25 cents.

47:53.959 --> 47:56.360
See my employees
drinking on the job,

47:56.362 --> 48:00.230
turn my head, it makes
them more entertaining.

48:01.367 --> 48:03.267
I don't murder people.

48:05.271 --> 48:08.405
What are your moral
qualms, Christian?

48:10.309 --> 48:12.309
Companies are amoral.

48:13.412 --> 48:17.381
Companies are also a
people, legally speaking.

48:17.383 --> 48:22.119
I figured if I wanted to get
rich, and I did, very much,

48:24.456 --> 48:27.224
it would be best to
function like a corporation.

48:27.226 --> 48:29.293
Yeah, except for
if you get caught.

48:29.295 --> 48:31.094
You get the gas chamber.

48:31.096 --> 48:35.365
I've gotta be honest, I
hope they let me watch.

48:35.367 --> 48:38.135
On the contrary if
you have as much money

48:38.137 --> 48:39.536
behind you as I have

48:39.538 --> 48:43.140
there's no real need for
a criminal justice system.

48:43.142 --> 48:46.209
You just pay a fine, work
it into the balance sheet.

48:46.211 --> 48:47.978
It's the cost of doing business.

48:47.980 --> 48:50.013
It's the American way.

48:50.015 --> 48:51.181
Sounds fulfilling.

48:51.183 --> 48:53.250
At least I have value.

48:54.586 --> 48:59.623
You and your friends? Just line
items on our expense report.

49:02.962 --> 49:07.664
Of course there is a way I'd
be willing to bend the rules.

49:08.701 --> 49:10.367
Get me the drive.

49:11.670 --> 49:14.204
I don't have it dickhead.

49:17.142 --> 49:20.444
And even if I did, there's
no way I'd give it to you.

49:20.446 --> 49:24.181
I'd rather die before
I give you that drive.

49:26.585 --> 49:31.421
Murphy, that is the first
thing you have said tonight

49:32.758 --> 49:35.559
that I have
unabashedly believed.

49:37.129 --> 49:39.463
What are your plans
for the kids inside?

49:39.465 --> 49:41.365
Gonna murder them too?

49:42.501 --> 49:47.404
No, I have something entirely
different in mind for them.

49:52.411 --> 49:54.177
Gentleman, inside.

50:17.469 --> 50:21.438
Hello, my name is Boland and
this is my associate Mr. Burke.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.440
We apologize for
the inconvenience

50:23.442 --> 50:24.574
of our activities this evening

50:24.576 --> 50:27.577
and we wish to
offer compensation.

50:27.579 --> 50:29.546
He needs a doctor.

50:29.548 --> 50:31.415
Hmm, yes he does.

50:31.417 --> 50:34.484
Of course, just as soon
as we can put all of this

50:34.486 --> 50:38.055
nasty business that we have
before us squarely behind us.

50:38.057 --> 50:38.722
But...

50:38.724 --> 50:40.524
Shh.

50:40.526 --> 50:43.226
I'm sorry, I realize
this is difficult,

50:43.228 --> 50:45.662
however we are prepared
to pay you generously

50:45.664 --> 50:47.364
for your continued silence

50:47.366 --> 50:49.833
regarding our
activities this evening.

50:49.835 --> 50:52.469
Do you have a figure in mind?

50:55.441 --> 51:00.410
Please speak up, I assure you
this is a one time only offer.

51:04.149 --> 51:07.184
Two million?

51:07.186 --> 51:09.786
Done.

51:11.557 --> 51:13.457
Burke will cut the check

51:13.459 --> 51:16.393
and draw up the standard
non-disclosure agreement.

51:16.395 --> 51:17.494
We will develop a cover story

51:17.496 --> 51:19.729
that will satisfy all
interested parties

51:19.731 --> 51:21.465
of which there should be few.

51:21.467 --> 51:23.233
I would also like to stress

51:23.235 --> 51:25.102
that this is a one
time only payment

51:25.104 --> 51:26.837
that is subject to all
applicable taxation

51:26.839 --> 51:29.873
and should you renege on
your legally binding contract

51:29.875 --> 51:34.611
we will be forced to take
further action, is that clear?

51:35.614 --> 51:36.614
Yes.

51:37.316 --> 51:39.416
Will you please help him?

51:40.586 --> 51:41.586
Of course.

51:47.693 --> 51:51.495
Pleasure doing business
with you Miss...

51:51.497 --> 51:52.562
Pewterschmidt.

51:54.566 --> 51:55.732
A lovely name.

52:02.641 --> 52:06.610
Ah, you see, you see
how generous I can be.

52:06.612 --> 52:08.512
Even the most distraught perk up

52:08.514 --> 52:11.181
when asked to name their price.

52:19.491 --> 52:24.494
We'll be at the rendezvous
point in two minutes.

52:24.496 --> 52:25.629
Okay full disclosure.

52:25.631 --> 52:27.297
I work for a company called PNR.

52:27.299 --> 52:28.916
Shampoo company.

52:28.917 --> 52:30.534
Shampoo, razors, ovens,
thermo-nuclear weapon casings,

52:30.536 --> 52:34.671
bunker busters, GPS guidance
computers, you get the point.

52:34.673 --> 52:36.506
So what exactly
do you do for them?

52:36.508 --> 52:37.541
Loss prevention.

52:37.543 --> 52:38.775
One of our high
level programmers

52:38.777 --> 52:41.244
decided to sell a file
to the competition.

52:41.246 --> 52:43.246
Now he's dead and
we can't find God.

52:43.248 --> 52:45.582
Well there's a lot of people
out there looking for him.

52:45.584 --> 52:48.919
The thumb drive, the
one that your father hid.

52:48.921 --> 52:51.488
Cooper, the dickhead at
the bar, left work today

52:51.490 --> 52:54.357
with the intent to sell
company secrets for millions.

52:54.359 --> 52:55.792
And I tracked his car
back to the Weasel,

52:55.794 --> 52:57.527
I attempted to drug him,

52:57.529 --> 52:58.795
but your waitress got to the
jump drive before I could

52:58.797 --> 53:00.897
and now we find ourselves
in a bit of a bind.

53:00.899 --> 53:02.532
So what's on the drive?

53:02.534 --> 53:03.767
That's a trade secret.

53:03.769 --> 53:04.968
I'm under contract
to not reveal any...

53:04.970 --> 53:06.603
Toothpaste.

53:06.605 --> 53:09.706
I took a sneak peek. So
what's so important about it?

53:09.708 --> 53:11.725
You know how no
matter how hard you try,

53:11.726 --> 53:13.743
you can't get the last bit of
toothpaste out of the tube?

53:13.745 --> 53:16.880
Formula NC17-42 would
put an end to that,

53:16.882 --> 53:19.349
with a liquid toothpaste
that gains viscosity

53:19.351 --> 53:21.518
and quadruples in volume when
it hits oxygen in the air,

53:21.520 --> 53:23.653
meaning that...
Not an ounce wasted.

53:23.655 --> 53:25.555
A tube of toothpaste
could last for months.

53:25.557 --> 53:27.257
Nearly a year.

53:27.259 --> 53:28.558
But PNR doesn't even
have a dental division.

53:28.560 --> 53:29.793
How'd you know that?

53:29.795 --> 53:30.794
I interviewed for your company.

53:30.796 --> 53:33.597
Did my homework,
didn't work out.

53:33.599 --> 53:35.115
Well you're right.

53:35.116 --> 53:36.632
This will be the
first of our new line.

53:36.635 --> 53:38.668
We're projected to go from
a zero to 12% market share

53:38.670 --> 53:40.370
in the first 12 months.

53:40.372 --> 53:43.006
No toothpaste formula is
worth this kind of trouble.

53:43.008 --> 53:44.741
Do you know how much

53:44.743 --> 53:46.376
the five-blade swivel head
razor cost us to develop?

53:46.378 --> 53:47.611
How much?

53:47.613 --> 53:49.713
1.3 billion in pay offs, 16 dead

53:49.715 --> 53:52.616
and water rights in
three African countries.

53:52.618 --> 53:53.618
We're here.

54:00.292 --> 54:01.958
So why don't you just kill me?

54:01.960 --> 54:04.594
Well, your daughter
has what I need,

54:04.596 --> 54:08.365
which makes you the
only leverage I have.

54:08.367 --> 54:09.367
You on the other hand.

54:11.270 --> 54:14.738
Bled out on the way
to the hospital.

54:14.740 --> 54:18.808
I'm so sorry, there was
just nothing to be done.

54:20.746 --> 54:24.447
Besides we can't have some
doctor asking questions right?

54:24.449 --> 54:25.715
You're sick.

54:26.618 --> 54:29.452
The whole system
is sick, Murphy.

54:31.023 --> 54:32.489
If I don't get that drive,

54:32.491 --> 54:34.791
the system may very
well become terminal

54:34.793 --> 54:37.394
and I can't let that happen.

54:39.698 --> 54:40.698
Let's go.

54:48.473 --> 54:51.441
First things first, we
survey R&P headquarters

54:51.443 --> 54:52.842
and try to track what
they did with Murphy.

54:52.844 --> 54:54.944
Then we can find the drive.

54:57.949 --> 54:59.416
Yeah.

54:59.418 --> 55:02.686
It's the dickweed
with the man bun.

55:02.688 --> 55:03.753
Talk.

55:03.755 --> 55:04.754
So terse.

55:04.756 --> 55:07.791
Still sore about me
trying to kill you.

55:07.793 --> 55:09.926
I'll get over it,
get to the point.

55:09.928 --> 55:12.896
I would like to propose a trade.

55:12.898 --> 55:17.667
I want the drive and I have
the bartender's father.

55:17.669 --> 55:19.636
What makes you think
we'd make that deal?

55:19.638 --> 55:23.039
Oh, because you
have a soft spot for this one.

55:23.041 --> 55:26.109
That's thin logic Boland.

55:26.111 --> 55:31.381
Maybe so, but I am a very
good judge of character.

55:32.718 --> 55:35.452
And you fancy yourself
the good guy in all this.

55:36.488 --> 55:39.556
So, bring me the
drive within the hour

55:41.526 --> 55:43.760
or I will send Murphy home

55:44.730 --> 55:48.031
to your bartender
girlfriend in pieces.

55:50.369 --> 55:51.601
Where?

55:51.603 --> 55:55.872
R&P headquarters. Just
you and the bartender.

55:55.874 --> 55:57.774
And no funny business.

55:59.544 --> 56:02.712
I'll let the receptionist
know that you're coming.

56:02.714 --> 56:03.913
Change of plans.

56:03.915 --> 56:05.949
Murphy told him
you have the drive.

56:05.951 --> 56:07.917
We're gonna meet 'em at
their headquarters downtown.

56:07.919 --> 56:09.719
So you and I are gonna
stroll into their headquarters,

56:09.721 --> 56:10.954
just you and me?

56:10.956 --> 56:12.722
'Cause that sounds like
a pretty shitty plan.

56:12.724 --> 56:14.624
Not just you and me.

56:14.626 --> 56:16.393
She's with me.

56:26.071 --> 56:27.871
Corporate didn't say
anything about her.

56:27.873 --> 56:29.139
Who the hell is she?

56:29.141 --> 56:30.840
That's my call.

56:31.810 --> 56:32.876
Yes ma'am.

56:34.112 --> 56:36.446
We're infiltrating R&P now.

56:36.448 --> 56:38.848
Do you have an entry strategy?

56:38.850 --> 56:40.116
Yeah we got one,
don't worry about it,

56:40.118 --> 56:42.485
this ain't our first pool party.

56:42.487 --> 56:43.853
She needs a gun.

56:50.929 --> 56:53.563
Trigger, safety,
magazine release.

56:53.565 --> 56:56.966
Two hands, point,
squeeze, gun go boom.

56:56.968 --> 56:57.968
Got it?

56:59.871 --> 57:00.820
Yeah.

57:00.821 --> 57:01.770
Yeah, good luck with that.

57:01.773 --> 57:02.972
Shut up.

57:05.444 --> 57:06.876
Listen up people.

57:09.781 --> 57:12.949
We have a meeting with
the competition tonight,

57:12.951 --> 57:15.885
and they have home
court advantage.

57:15.887 --> 57:18.922
There's a man named Murphy,
six foot three, 270,

57:18.924 --> 57:21.891
muscular build, brown
hair and a beard.

57:21.893 --> 57:23.193
He has intel on the location

57:23.195 --> 57:26.563
of a vitally
important PNR asset.

57:26.565 --> 57:30.633
So his unharmed recovery
is your top priority.

57:30.635 --> 57:34.037
Other priorities. Try
not to get killed.

57:39.010 --> 57:40.176
Nice pep talk.

57:40.178 --> 57:41.178
Thanks.

57:42.247 --> 57:43.680
Wanna make out?

57:43.682 --> 57:44.682
No.

57:45.517 --> 57:46.483
But I got a gun.

57:46.485 --> 57:49.819
Round it up people!

57:49.821 --> 57:51.187
Come on bitches.

58:25.690 --> 58:29.659
So right now you're
probably asking yourself,

58:30.996 --> 58:34.964
why am I duct taped to an
office chair on the top floor

58:36.535 --> 58:39.569
of one of the most prolific
publicly traded companies

58:39.571 --> 58:40.937
on the exchange?

58:40.939 --> 58:42.739
I thought we'd covered this.

58:42.741 --> 58:43.907
Not really.

58:45.310 --> 58:47.644
You've heard of a
cost benefit analysis,

58:47.646 --> 58:50.547
I'm sure, being a
business man yourself.

58:50.549 --> 58:52.115
So here's a query.

58:54.586 --> 58:59.188
At what point does collateral
damage become unacceptable?

59:01.226 --> 59:04.661
When it becomes too expensive.

59:04.663 --> 59:06.062
Exactly.

59:09.968 --> 59:11.968
A plus plus plus.

59:11.969 --> 59:13.969
You see, when I asked your
waitress to name her price,

59:13.972 --> 59:17.106
I wasn't being
entirely forthright.

59:17.108 --> 59:18.641
Hmm.

59:18.643 --> 59:22.645
There is a financial
maximum, a boiling point

59:23.982 --> 59:28.885
where it simply becomes too
expensive to keep someone alive.

59:30.021 --> 59:32.155
Now that figure varies
from person to person,

59:32.157 --> 59:36.693
situation to situation,
but all things being equal

59:36.695 --> 59:40.063
the cost to cover
up a total loss.

59:40.065 --> 59:41.731
You mean, murder.

59:45.103 --> 59:47.604
Potato, potahto.

59:47.606 --> 59:49.205
And by cover up I'm talking

59:49.207 --> 59:51.908
cover story, body
disposal, the whole nine.

59:51.910 --> 59:53.343
Get to the point.

59:58.883 --> 01:00:01.000
2.2 million.

01:00:01.001 --> 01:00:03.118
So your waitress friend
is very lucky to be alive.

01:00:04.155 --> 01:00:06.389
If she said 2.4, even 2.3,

01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:13.363
I would have been forced to...

01:00:13.365 --> 01:00:15.665
Shoot her in the head.

01:00:15.667 --> 01:00:17.800
Execute company policy.

01:00:18.703 --> 01:00:20.003
Potato, potahto.

01:00:20.005 --> 01:00:23.940
Nothing personal, it's
just cost versus benefit.

01:00:34.285 --> 01:00:36.886
So is this pretty much like
a regular occurrence for you

01:00:36.888 --> 01:00:39.088
with the whole SWAT
team, raiding situation?

01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:40.890
Once, maybe twice a year.

01:00:40.892 --> 01:00:42.091
It comes in waves.

01:00:42.093 --> 01:00:44.060
Can I ask you a question?

01:00:44.062 --> 01:00:45.395
Yeah anything.

01:00:45.396 --> 01:00:46.729
Why didn't you call the police?

01:00:46.731 --> 01:00:48.164
'Cause that douchebag Boland guy

01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:50.166
had some sort of program
on his cell phone

01:00:50.168 --> 01:00:53.836
that locked our
cellular devices so...

01:00:53.838 --> 01:00:55.438
He did that from his phone.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.073
Yeah, I thought all
you corporate bad-asses

01:00:57.075 --> 01:00:58.675
had that ability.

01:00:58.677 --> 01:01:00.710
That's a new one to me.

01:01:02.013 --> 01:01:03.363
Huh, it's a shame

01:01:03.364 --> 01:01:04.714
because it seems like
it'd be really helpful

01:01:04.716 --> 01:01:06.749
for PNR's military
program right now.

01:01:06.751 --> 01:01:07.984
I'll look into it.

01:01:07.986 --> 01:01:08.918
Hmm.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.453
So can I ask you a question?

01:01:10.455 --> 01:01:11.688
Sure.

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:14.123
Do you find me attractive?

01:01:14.125 --> 01:01:18.961
Let's table that conversation
for this particular moment.

01:01:18.963 --> 01:01:22.965
Okay, 'cause I, I think
you're really pretty.

01:01:31.176 --> 01:01:34.310
I do understand
your perspective,

01:01:34.312 --> 01:01:37.213
after all, I am
going to kill you.

01:01:40.351 --> 01:01:43.186
Let's get things back on track.

01:01:43.188 --> 01:01:48.257
You're probably asking yourself
why aren't you dead already?

01:01:50.195 --> 01:01:53.730
Here's a term you've
probably never heard.

01:01:54.466 --> 01:01:56.799
Downside risk management.

01:01:59.003 --> 01:02:02.038
It means, in any
financial situation,

01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:08.144
one must prepare for the worst
by hedging one's investments.

01:02:09.114 --> 01:02:11.881
And that is where you come in.

01:02:13.151 --> 01:02:16.986
When your daughter
walks through that door,

01:02:18.823 --> 01:02:22.792
I'm going to subdue her
by any force necessary,

01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:27.830
take the drive
and kill you both.

01:02:29.534 --> 01:02:32.502
That is the best case scenario.

01:02:36.941 --> 01:02:40.409
But what if she doesn't
have what she says?

01:02:41.479 --> 01:02:44.080
Then I bring her back here,

01:02:47.118 --> 01:02:48.484
to this very room.

01:02:51.122 --> 01:02:52.321
I take a knife

01:02:55.093 --> 01:02:58.227
and I start to cut
things off of her.

01:02:59.264 --> 01:03:00.496
Until you talk.

01:03:03.535 --> 01:03:08.237
And if that doesn't work,
I cut you, until she talks.

01:03:12.443 --> 01:03:16.212
No matter what happens,
I get what I want.

01:03:18.183 --> 01:03:21.350
And that is downside
risk management.

01:03:27.025 --> 01:03:30.927
Which brings things full
circle as to why you,

01:03:33.097 --> 01:03:35.331
a bar owner, with no 401K,

01:03:37.202 --> 01:03:42.271
find yourself duct taped to an
office chair on the top floor

01:03:43.441 --> 01:03:45.942
of one of the most prolific
publicly traded companies

01:03:45.944 --> 01:03:47.343
on the exchange.

01:03:50.148 --> 01:03:52.348
Now I would love
to stay and chat,

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:55.251
but I do have a
meeting to get to.

01:03:56.588 --> 01:03:58.120
But don't fear.

01:03:59.958 --> 01:04:03.359
I have arranged for a
little entertainment.

01:04:10.268 --> 01:04:13.903
I'm sure you've
probably been wondering

01:04:13.905 --> 01:04:18.374
what kind of organization
would hire a monster like me.

01:04:31.322 --> 01:04:33.923
Now you can know everything.

01:04:34.559 --> 01:04:36.259
Congratulations,

01:04:36.261 --> 01:04:38.361
you've just joined a family.

01:04:38.363 --> 01:04:40.363
One of the most exciting
and successful businesses

01:04:40.365 --> 01:04:42.565
of the 20th Century.
What the hell is this?

01:04:42.567 --> 01:04:44.400
- But R&P wasn't always...
- Jesus.

01:04:44.402 --> 01:04:46.369
The powerhouse
of global commerce

01:04:46.371 --> 01:04:49.272
whose headquarters you
find yourself in today.

01:04:49.274 --> 01:04:51.274
Through the years
this great company

01:04:51.276 --> 01:04:55.311
has gone through 76 different
mergers and acquisitions,

01:04:55.313 --> 01:04:59.482
all of which I'll discuss
in detail right now.

01:04:59.484 --> 01:05:00.484
In 1930...

01:05:05.323 --> 01:05:07.123
So what's the plan?

01:05:07.125 --> 01:05:08.991
We walk in and have our meeting.

01:05:08.993 --> 01:05:11.594
Okay, so what about your friends
in little black leotards?

01:05:11.596 --> 01:05:14.597
Insurance for any
unforeseen complications.

01:05:14.599 --> 01:05:17.133
Do you expect any
unforeseen complications?

01:05:17.135 --> 01:05:18.134
Most definitely.

01:05:18.136 --> 01:05:20.136
Oh great, okay, cool.

01:05:47.632 --> 01:05:49.465
Good evening, can I help you?

01:05:49.467 --> 01:05:52.735
We have an appointment.
We're here a little early.

01:05:52.737 --> 01:05:54.437
And who are you here to see?

01:05:54.439 --> 01:05:56.439
You know who we're here to see.

01:05:56.441 --> 01:05:57.540
Hmm-mm.

01:05:59.344 --> 01:06:01.677
Your appointment is here, sir.

01:06:01.679 --> 01:06:02.679
Absolutely.

01:06:04.215 --> 01:06:05.514
Right this way.

01:06:08.219 --> 01:06:10.219
I am so sorry for the walk,

01:06:10.221 --> 01:06:12.221
but our east elevator
bank is broken.

01:06:12.223 --> 01:06:15.424
Then again it's always something
with this old building.

01:06:15.426 --> 01:06:16.592
If it's not the elevator,

01:06:16.594 --> 01:06:18.728
then the coffee machine
is on the fritz.

01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:20.529
Then again I shouldn't complain.

01:06:20.531 --> 01:06:23.766
R&P is one of the
top 10 places to work

01:06:23.768 --> 01:06:27.069
according to Corporate
Quarterly. Did you know that?

01:06:27.071 --> 01:06:28.504
No, tell us more.

01:06:28.506 --> 01:06:31.173
Well the building
was built in 1964.

01:06:31.175 --> 01:06:33.242
It was originally
the Stark's Building

01:06:33.244 --> 01:06:34.744
and housed the worlds first

01:06:34.746 --> 01:06:37.346
multi-national
farming conglomerate.

01:06:37.348 --> 01:06:39.181
Can I get you anything, coffee?

01:06:39.183 --> 01:06:40.183
No.

01:06:46.424 --> 01:06:47.424
Oh dear.

01:06:48.726 --> 01:06:52.128
Put down your weapons
or we will shoot.

01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:54.363
We'll put our guns down.

01:07:09.514 --> 01:07:10.746
Where's the meeting being held?

01:07:10.748 --> 01:07:11.814
I don't know.

01:07:11.816 --> 01:07:13.482
Where'd they take Murphy?

01:07:13.484 --> 01:07:15.451
Tall guy with a tan,
doesn't work here.

01:07:15.453 --> 01:07:16.585
11th floor.

01:07:23.761 --> 01:07:25.594
You didn't need to do that.

01:07:25.596 --> 01:07:27.396
She's just some poor
receptionist biding her time

01:07:27.398 --> 01:07:28.431
until she has to...

01:07:28.433 --> 01:07:30.533
Do you have a plan or something?

01:07:30.535 --> 01:07:32.535
I'll cover you.
Get to the elevator.

01:07:32.537 --> 01:07:34.236
- And?
- Try not to get shot.

01:07:34.238 --> 01:07:35.238
Sold.

01:07:48.186 --> 01:07:49.685
Serious question, if I
had more money in my wallet

01:07:49.687 --> 01:07:51.353
and a big cushy corporate job,

01:07:51.355 --> 01:07:52.555
would you be more likely
to go home with me tonight?

01:07:52.557 --> 01:07:53.940
Is that a
question or a statement?

01:07:53.941 --> 01:07:55.324
I don't know, I'm just feeling
really insecure about it.

01:07:55.326 --> 01:07:56.258
- Nic.
- Yeah.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.260
Cover your ears.

01:07:58.796 --> 01:07:59.862
Move your ass.

01:07:59.864 --> 01:08:00.864
Okay.

01:08:24.889 --> 01:08:25.889
Asshole!

01:08:42.473 --> 01:08:43.538
I already hit the button.

01:08:43.541 --> 01:08:45.307
Good thinking.

01:08:47.511 --> 01:08:48.544
Shit.

01:08:48.546 --> 01:08:51.546
And yes, I find you attractive.

01:08:52.383 --> 01:08:53.383
Good.

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:31.487
You wanted a job at PNR?

01:09:31.488 --> 01:09:33.589
Is being a bartender
really that bad?

01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:34.622
Honestly?

01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:35.457
Yeah.

01:09:35.459 --> 01:09:36.591
No, it isn't.

01:09:36.593 --> 01:09:37.725
I just assumed I'd be
doing something other

01:09:37.728 --> 01:09:38.661
than working for
my estranged father

01:09:38.662 --> 01:09:40.462
and hocking booze to frat guys.

01:09:40.464 --> 01:09:42.932
Low stress job, family
business, hot chicks.

01:09:42.934 --> 01:09:44.733
Well when you put it that way.

01:09:45.703 --> 01:09:47.203
I'm almost out.

01:10:22.707 --> 01:10:24.974
Nic, you aren't helping!

01:10:43.728 --> 01:10:46.795
Get off her, you son of a bitch!

01:10:51.602 --> 01:10:53.736
Come on bitch, come on.

01:11:04.097 --> 01:11:05.747
It feels good doesn't it?
But don't get used to it.

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:07.583
This is my building.

01:11:07.584 --> 01:11:09.417
In 60 seconds there's
gonna be 15 operatives

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.553
breathing down your neck.

01:11:18.062 --> 01:11:19.762
What now?

01:11:19.764 --> 01:11:23.032
He's right. We're screwed
and I don't have a plan B.

01:11:23.034 --> 01:11:24.034
I do.

01:11:26.037 --> 01:11:27.603
Do you trust me?

01:11:37.915 --> 01:11:38.915
Shit.

01:11:40.384 --> 01:11:42.451
Nic, how the hell did
you get in here? Jesus.

01:11:42.453 --> 01:11:44.120
Hi, nice to see you alive again,

01:11:44.121 --> 01:11:45.788
and you're welcome 'cause I
just totally rescued your ass.

01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:47.456
Rescued is a strong word.

01:11:47.458 --> 01:11:48.657
Well done,

01:11:48.659 --> 01:11:50.793
agent Shields, well done.

01:11:51.896 --> 01:11:54.496
Your name is Shields,
like Brooke Shields.

01:11:54.498 --> 01:11:55.498
Nic.

01:11:57.335 --> 01:12:01.570
Bachman, Reginald Bachman,
CEO of R&P Industries.

01:12:04.809 --> 01:12:06.475
You know, Agent Shields,

01:12:06.477 --> 01:12:08.811
that is not going
to do you any good.

01:12:08.813 --> 01:12:12.848
You see, my assistant
has already informed me

01:12:13.751 --> 01:12:16.485
that your people are in retreat.

01:12:17.722 --> 01:12:22.791
And my men, well, they're going
to come through that door.

01:12:23.527 --> 01:12:24.793
Right about now.

01:12:27.898 --> 01:12:29.832
When'd you go all
Black Widow on me Nicki?

01:12:29.834 --> 01:12:30.899
Not now, Murphy.

01:12:30.901 --> 01:12:33.736
I'd like to know
what you're doing?

01:12:33.738 --> 01:12:37.072
I mean, let's look
at this, escape was...

01:12:37.074 --> 01:12:39.675
Escape was never the plan.

01:12:41.812 --> 01:12:43.145
I see.

01:12:43.147 --> 01:12:46.014
I asked for a
meeting, and goddammit

01:12:46.016 --> 01:12:49.952
I would appreciate a
little professionalism.

01:12:51.655 --> 01:12:53.522
Please, have a seat.

01:12:54.859 --> 01:12:56.692
Sit.

01:13:11.909 --> 01:13:14.143
Boland, you disappoint me.

01:13:15.546 --> 01:13:16.845
It wasn't a fair fight they...

01:13:16.847 --> 01:13:17.780
What?

01:13:17.782 --> 01:13:19.047
They didn't play by the rules.

01:13:19.049 --> 01:13:21.049
Oh my god they cheated.

01:13:21.051 --> 01:13:22.651
No, no no no no,

01:13:25.823 --> 01:13:28.457
you got beaten fair and square.

01:13:30.961 --> 01:13:35.764
But as it stands, that's
not what I'm talking about.

01:13:35.766 --> 01:13:38.500
Killing indiscriminately,

01:13:38.502 --> 01:13:42.871
allowing one of your agents
to draw his weapon in public

01:13:42.873 --> 01:13:45.974
and you went
commando in my lobby!

01:13:47.211 --> 01:13:49.545
Never shit where you eat.

01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:53.582
It wasn't like that.

01:13:53.584 --> 01:13:54.584
Ah.

01:13:57.154 --> 01:14:01.490
I have no interest in
what you have to say.

01:14:01.492 --> 01:14:02.558
Now or ever.

01:14:04.028 --> 01:14:08.464
Young lady, do me a favor.
Put that gag in his mouth.

01:14:11.836 --> 01:14:12.836
Gladly.

01:14:17.842 --> 01:14:21.910
Now that that unpleasantness
is taken care of,

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:27.049
I believe you and I have
some business to discuss.

01:14:28.152 --> 01:14:29.818
I have a proposition.

01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:32.221
Murphy's life for the drive.

01:14:35.025 --> 01:14:39.928
You do understand

01:14:39.930 --> 01:14:43.699
that I could kill
every one of you.

01:14:43.701 --> 01:14:45.501
Then I could pry the drive

01:14:45.503 --> 01:14:48.737
from your dead,
clammy little fingers.

01:14:50.975 --> 01:14:53.809
But I do understand
your problem.

01:14:56.714 --> 01:14:59.648
So, knowing the probability
of capture and death

01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:00.949
you don't think we'd
be stupid enough

01:15:00.951 --> 01:15:02.518
to bring the drive with us do...

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.920
Not a smart move, Nic.

01:15:04.922 --> 01:15:07.556
Mr. Bachman, I'm
taking a gamble here.

01:15:07.558 --> 01:15:09.858
If I could just get like 60
seconds, a minute of your time?

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:12.761
After that I'll gladly
slide this drive over to you

01:15:12.763 --> 01:15:13.929
and you can do whatever you feel

01:15:13.931 --> 01:15:16.665
best suits your
shareholders' needs.

01:15:16.667 --> 01:15:18.834
Until then I ask two things.

01:15:18.836 --> 01:15:21.169
Number one, please
don't kill us.

01:15:21.171 --> 01:15:23.872
Number two, listen carefully.

01:15:23.874 --> 01:15:25.257
Think about this Nic.

01:15:25.258 --> 01:15:26.641
Nicki, you're gonna
get yourself killed.

01:15:26.644 --> 01:15:28.010
Dad, I got this.

01:15:30.581 --> 01:15:33.081
You intrigue me, young lady.

01:15:34.184 --> 01:15:37.019
Very well, you have my word,

01:15:37.021 --> 01:15:38.954
and your 60 seconds

01:15:42.826 --> 01:15:43.826
starts now.

01:15:48.098 --> 01:15:49.298
What I have here represents,

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:51.900
as Agent Shields
has explained to me,

01:15:51.902 --> 01:15:54.970
a huge threat to R&P's brand
of dental hygiene products.

01:15:54.972 --> 01:15:56.838
Using this, PNR can
launch themselves

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.173
into the sector with gusto,

01:15:58.175 --> 01:16:02.177
securing 12 to 15% of the
market in just six months.

01:16:02.179 --> 01:16:04.913
By stealing it, you're hoping
to undercut their pricing,

01:16:04.915 --> 01:16:06.615
beat them to the market

01:16:06.617 --> 01:16:09.351
and with your existing brand
recognition in dental hygiene

01:16:09.353 --> 01:16:12.120
steal eight to 10% of
the market share back.

01:16:12.122 --> 01:16:14.056
But I have a better suggestion.

01:16:14.058 --> 01:16:16.041
Take all of it.

01:16:16.042 --> 01:16:18.025
I'm proposing a deal that
will give PNR the incentive

01:16:18.028 --> 01:16:19.328
to never go to market

01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:22.898
with their proposed
dental hygiene plan.

01:16:24.068 --> 01:16:27.836
You do understand that PNR
would not give up one iota

01:16:27.838 --> 01:16:31.974
of market share in
exchange for your life?

01:16:31.976 --> 01:16:34.109
No, in exchange for this.

01:16:34.111 --> 01:16:35.978
Brooke, Boland's phone.

01:16:41.986 --> 01:16:43.685
Boland, passcode.

01:16:46.957 --> 01:16:49.091
Give it to her.

01:16:49.093 --> 01:16:51.193
Six, six, six, nine.

01:16:56.133 --> 01:16:58.300
Here we are CelluLockdown,

01:16:58.302 --> 01:17:00.135
that's a really
fucking terrible name.

01:17:00.137 --> 01:17:01.303
It's a simple app
coupled with GPS

01:17:01.305 --> 01:17:02.904
and cellular network relays

01:17:02.906 --> 01:17:04.139
that can selectively
limit cellular service

01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:06.308
to a small number of
users or an entire region

01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:08.677
at the click of a button.

01:17:08.679 --> 01:17:09.679
You awake?

01:17:10.781 --> 01:17:12.014
From the little I've seen,

01:17:12.016 --> 01:17:13.982
the good folks at PNR
would gladly trade

01:17:13.984 --> 01:17:15.951
a measly 4% share in toothpaste

01:17:15.953 --> 01:17:18.086
to get their hands on
this one little app.

01:17:18.088 --> 01:17:19.605
Why?

01:17:19.606 --> 01:17:21.123
PNR holds numerous
lucrative defense contracts

01:17:21.125 --> 01:17:23.759
in data mining and
information technology.

01:17:23.761 --> 01:17:26.061
Contracts that are
decades away for R&P.

01:17:26.063 --> 01:17:27.996
So while this handy
little espionage tool

01:17:27.998 --> 01:17:30.999
is a fun gadget for Agent
Douchebag over here,

01:17:31.001 --> 01:17:33.235
it's worthless to
your bottom line.

01:17:33.237 --> 01:17:35.871
You give them the technology,
they give you the formula,

01:17:35.873 --> 01:17:37.139
everybody makes more money

01:17:37.141 --> 01:17:38.940
without any pesky competition,

01:17:38.942 --> 01:17:41.977
and as a show of good faith
you let us leave alive.

01:17:45.049 --> 01:17:46.148
Time's up.

01:17:53.991 --> 01:17:56.191
Would this be agreeable
to your employer?

01:17:56.193 --> 01:17:57.325
Absolutely.

01:17:59.196 --> 01:18:02.431
And would the board
of PNR, approve of this?

01:18:02.433 --> 01:18:04.166
They already have.

01:18:07.071 --> 01:18:12.140
Well, well,
well, then you have a deal.

01:18:14.078 --> 01:18:19.047
We'll deliver the paperwork
before end of business today.

01:18:19.049 --> 01:18:20.049
Really?

01:18:21.051 --> 01:18:22.184
Sorry?

01:18:22.186 --> 01:18:23.819
We're done?

01:18:23.821 --> 01:18:26.221
Oh, you're all free to go.

01:18:36.967 --> 01:18:39.401
What about this guy?

01:18:39.403 --> 01:18:41.069
What about him?

01:18:41.071 --> 01:18:45.240
He killed one of my
employees. He kidnapped me.

01:18:45.242 --> 01:18:47.242
He tried to murder my daughter.

01:18:47.244 --> 01:18:50.345
I wanna see him
brought to justice.

01:18:50.347 --> 01:18:58.347
Alright, Mr. Boland, you are no
longer employed by R&P Industries.

01:19:01.792 --> 01:19:02.792
You son of bitch.

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:12.934
Free market, it's a bitch.

01:19:16.073 --> 01:19:18.540
Right, we're gonna go now, so.

01:19:19.343 --> 01:19:20.343
Come on.

01:19:32.389 --> 01:19:33.889
It's a tough business,

01:19:33.891 --> 01:19:36.024
I can tell why you're so jaded.

01:19:36.026 --> 01:19:37.425
Can somebody
please explain to me

01:19:37.427 --> 01:19:38.994
what the hell happened in there?

01:19:38.996 --> 01:19:40.095
That was by far the most...

01:19:40.097 --> 01:19:41.930
Brave, intelligent,
wildly heroic.

01:19:41.932 --> 01:19:45.500
Stupid thing I've
ever seen anyone do.

01:19:45.502 --> 01:19:48.286
Well, I didn't see anybody
else stepping up so...

01:19:48.287 --> 01:19:51.071
Because it was also
brilliant, and a little sexy.

01:19:51.074 --> 01:19:54.142
She's right, you were brilliant.

01:19:54.144 --> 01:19:58.380
I know I don't say this
enough, not really at all.

01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:01.917
But when I was
tied to that chair

01:20:01.919 --> 01:20:03.852
and I didn't know if I
was gonna get out alive,

01:20:03.854 --> 01:20:06.154
all I could think about was you.

01:20:06.156 --> 01:20:11.092
I know I haven't made you a
priority in my life, I'm sorry.

01:20:11.094 --> 01:20:14.930
But I promise Nicki, I'm
gonna be there for you,

01:20:14.932 --> 01:20:18.033
just like you were
here for me tonight.

01:20:18.035 --> 01:20:19.401
I love you Nicki.

01:20:19.403 --> 01:20:21.036
Family first, right?

01:20:22.005 --> 01:20:23.839
Goddammit.

01:20:32.916 --> 01:20:34.616
If you want that desk job,

01:20:34.617 --> 01:20:36.317
I think I might be able
to pull a few strings.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:39.154
You know I think I've had
enough of corporate America.

01:20:39.156 --> 01:20:42.123
But thanks, I'll totally
save you a seat at the bar.

01:20:42.125 --> 01:20:44.059
It's a date.

01:20:44.061 --> 01:20:45.126
Want a ride home?

01:20:45.128 --> 01:20:48.029
That's okay, I think we'll walk.

01:20:51.935 --> 01:20:55.003
Oh and Nic, assuming
we can come to some sort

01:20:55.005 --> 01:20:58.073
of non disclosure agreement
and I don't have to kill you,

01:20:58.075 --> 01:21:01.209
I think a little
compensation is in order.

01:21:01.211 --> 01:21:04.546
Considering you just made PNR
a significant amount of money.

01:21:04.548 --> 01:21:06.915
Well, have your
people call my people.

01:21:06.917 --> 01:21:07.649
What about me?

01:21:07.651 --> 01:21:09.217
Name your price.

01:21:10.988 --> 01:21:12.320
I want a boat.

01:21:12.322 --> 01:21:15.190
That's not outside the
realm of possibility.

01:21:15.192 --> 01:21:16.324
A big boat.

01:21:19.029 --> 01:21:19.961
A big boat?

01:21:19.963 --> 01:21:20.962
Where'd you get people?

01:21:20.964 --> 01:21:22.397
I got people.

01:21:22.399 --> 01:21:24.032
I got you and LeighAnne.

01:21:24.034 --> 01:21:26.201
Oh so that means you're
gonna rescind your resignation?

01:21:26.203 --> 01:21:28.503
Maybe, but I'm
gonna need a raise.

01:21:28.505 --> 01:21:31.573
Is that before or
after I fix the bar

01:21:31.575 --> 01:21:34.175
and convince all the regulars
they're not in mortal danger.

01:21:34.177 --> 01:21:35.911
When are you gonna
have time to do that

01:21:35.913 --> 01:21:37.279
when you're tooling around
on your boat all day?

01:21:37.281 --> 01:21:39.014
Geez, really a boat?

01:21:40.083 --> 01:21:42.550
Yeah, a boat, a train,
I really don't care

01:21:42.552 --> 01:21:45.086
as long as it gets me
away from the free market.

01:21:45.088 --> 01:21:46.288
I'm done.

01:21:46.290 --> 01:21:48.957
Of course it's just
a pipe dream so...

01:21:48.959 --> 01:21:51.226
Don't say that dad, who
knows what you accomplish.

01:21:51.228 --> 01:21:52.694
I meet this is America,
land of the home,

01:21:52.696 --> 01:21:56.131
free and the brave and all that good stuff.
You feel me?

01:21:56.133 --> 01:21:57.432
