33:54.433 --> 33:56.202
ELLEN SAID YOU TOLD HER
YOU WERE INNOCENT,

33:56.235 --> 33:57.569

33:59.805 --> 34:04.743

ARRESTED, SHE CAME TO SEE ME.

34:09.415 --> 34:11.517

THAT I WAS FRAMED.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.719

THAT THE FLYNNS

OF THE LINE

STOP INVESTIGATING IMMEDIATELY.

34:33.339 --> 34:36.275
ELLEN, YOUR MOTHER, YOU.

34:36.308 --> 34:39.278
THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT EVERYONE
WAS TO CONFESS

34:39.311 --> 34:41.947
AND TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE
AGAINST THE FLYNNS.

34:41.980 --> 34:44.950

39:13.351 --> 39:14.720
SO WE GOT HIM.

39:14.753 --> 39:15.854
WE DID.

39:15.887 --> 39:18.424
WHAT AREN'T YOU
TELLING ME?

39:18.457 --> 39:22.894
SOMEBODY ELSE GOT HIM,
TOO.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.598
FLYNN WAS BEING ESCORTED
TO A TRANSPORT CAR

39:26.632 --> 39:29.234
WHEN HE WAS STABBED TO DEATH
BY A PRISONER WITH A SHIV.

39:29.267 --> 39:31.036
SOMEONE WANTED HIM DEAD
AWFULLY FAST.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.539
VERY FEW PEOPLE
KNEW HE WAS THERE.

39:33.572 --> 39:36.341
WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHO
HAD ACCESS TO FLYNN'S
RELEASE DOCUMENTS.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.644
I'M ON IT.
IT'S NOT A LONG LIST.

39:40.278 --> 39:44.282
BUT THE BAD NEWS IS,
WE LOST FLYNN AND
WHATEVER HE KNOWS.

39:44.315 --> 39:46.217
WELL, HE MUST HAVE BEEN
WORKING WITH SOMEONE,

39:46.251 --> 39:47.419
LOOKING
FOR ELLEN'S EVIDENCE BOX.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.254
SOMEONE WHO KNEW THAT FLYNN'S
ONLY ANGLE IN PRISON

39:49.287 --> 39:51.857
WOULD BE TO TURN ON THEM,
SO FLYNN HAD TO DIE AND FAST.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.425
NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS,

39:53.459 --> 39:55.461
WE FORCED SOMEONE
TO PLAY THEIR HAND.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.629
AND LIKE DIANA SAID,
IT'S NOT A LONG LIST.

39:57.663 --> 40:00.265
BUT WHOEVER IT IS
HAS AN INCREDIBLE REACH.

40:00.298 --> 40:03.902
NEAL, IF THEY CAN GET TO FLYNN
LIKE THIS...

40:03.935 --> 40:05.303
JAMES IS RIGHT.

40:05.336 --> 40:06.304
HE ISN'T SAFE HERE.

40:06.337 --> 40:07.739
I CAN'T SEND HIM AWAY.

40:07.773 --> 40:10.308
ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE,
UNTIL WE KNOW MORE.

40:10.341 --> 40:11.743
HE'LL BE BACK.

40:11.777 --> 40:13.278
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

40:13.311 --> 40:14.412
TALK TO HIM.

40:16.515 --> 40:18.484
[ SIGHS ]

40:18.517 --> 40:21.086

40:24.590 --> 40:28.293
[ CLICK ]

40:28.326 --> 40:30.762

40:30.796 --> 40:33.632
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS
WITH ME.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.734
ELLEN SAID THAT WHATEVER'S
IN THAT PENDANT

40:35.767 --> 40:37.936
IS THE KEY
TO FINDING THE EVIDENCE BOX.

40:37.969 --> 40:41.172
AND HOPEFULLY
TO CLEARING MY NAME.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.274
SO, HOW DO WE DO IT?

40:43.308 --> 40:45.443
WELL, I'M LISTED
AS HER NEXT OF KIN,

40:45.477 --> 40:47.078
SO NOW THAT THE FLYNN CASE
IS WRAPPED UP,

40:47.112 --> 40:48.313
IT'LL BE SENT TO ME.

40:48.346 --> 40:49.948
GREAT.
ONCE WE HAVE THE KEY --

40:49.981 --> 40:51.783
ONCE I HAVE THE KEY.

40:51.817 --> 40:55.120
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I-I THOUGHT YOU BELIEVED ME.

40:55.153 --> 40:58.490
I DO.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

40:58.524 --> 41:00.291
YOU NEED
TO LEAVE NEW YORK.
NO.

41:00.325 --> 41:01.760
IT'S NOT SAFE
FOR YOU HERE.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.461
NO, I'VE LEFT YOU
TOO MANY TIMES.

41:03.495 --> 41:05.030
THEY GOT TO ELLEN.
THEY GOT TO FLYNN.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.732
THEY ALMOST GOT TO YOU.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.435
MOZZIE HAS A SAFE HOUSE
OUTSIDE THE CITY.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.270
IT'S COMPLETELY
OFF THE RADAR.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.273
YOU CAN STAY THERE.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.742
ALL RIGHT.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.313
I WANT YOU TO BE
A PART OF MY LIFE.

ALL RIGHT, UH...

41:35.260 --> 41:37.462

41:37.495 --> 41:39.030
LOOK, ONCE PETER AND I
FIGURE THIS OUT,

41:39.064 --> 41:40.465
WE CAN TAKE THEM DOWN
TOGETHER.

HE'S WAITING OUTSIDE
TO GIVE YOU A RIDE, SO...

41:51.276 --> 41:56.414

SEE YOU AGAIN.
