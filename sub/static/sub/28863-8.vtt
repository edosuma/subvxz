DAVID:
Lessons in time travel,

01:49.243 --> 01:51.979
chapter zero.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.815
Who we were does not dictate

01:54.915 --> 01:57.451
who we will be.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.187
But often...

01:59.287 --> 02:01.889
it's a pretty good indication.

02:01.989 --> 02:03.624
(squelching)

02:08.996 --> 02:11.365
Time travel does not give one

02:11.465 --> 02:12.866
the opportunity
to change oneself.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.003
But rather,

02:16.103 --> 02:17.971
to eradicate oneself...

02:18.071 --> 02:20.007
(squelching)

02:23.844 --> 02:25.979
(whirring)

02:26.079 --> 02:27.748
...and allow something else
to form

02:27.848 --> 02:30.218
in the wake of what once was.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.527
And in this is
a sort of grace...

02:39.627 --> 02:40.894
(rumbling)

02:40.994 --> 02:42.663
...or madness.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.899
Your turn.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.274
(exhales)

02:55.343 --> 02:57.345
(squelching)

02:59.112 --> 03:01.081

(exhales)

03:25.373 --> 03:26.440
(speaking Mandarin)

03:41.154 --> 03:42.923
It's okay.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.725
I'm gonna fix this.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.329
It'll all be over soon.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.936
To the death.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.005
DAVID:
Because if we don't believe

03:58.105 --> 03:59.573
in change...

04:01.642 --> 04:03.844
...then we don't
believe in time.

(door creaks closed)

04:12.986 --> 04:14.622
(chain rattling)

04:23.631 --> 04:24.965
I like this.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.635
CHARLES:
What?

04:28.669 --> 04:30.304
Us.

04:30.404 --> 04:33.173
*

04:39.713 --> 04:41.214
You.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.553
(chuckles)

04:47.555 --> 04:50.324
I simply can't quit you,
my dear.

04:50.424 --> 04:54.294
Nor would you want me to,
I suspect.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.129
This is...

04:56.229 --> 04:57.531
My Farouk.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.967
The parasite in my skull.

05:00.067 --> 05:03.504
(chuckles) Such a pleasure
to see you again, Charles.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.539
It's been quite some time.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.140
You deceived me.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.242
I came here in good faith.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.011
You broke my boy.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.980
Your boy has always
been broken, I'm told.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.315
Now I know you.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.217
David.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.019
The victim.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.888
A boy pretending to be a man.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.424
Always blaming others.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.258
Boo-hoo.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.528
-(Amahl laughs)
-David, per...

05:30.030 --> 05:32.165
(Farouk gasps)

05:32.265 --> 05:34.602
I suppose...

05:34.702 --> 05:36.570
this makes us dance partners.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.071
Does it not?

05:39.773 --> 05:41.875
-(gunshot echoes)
-Go, go, go.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.712
-Go.
-(baby wailing)

05:44.812 --> 05:47.347
*

05:49.016 --> 05:50.618
Kerry!

05:53.286 --> 05:55.523
Kerry...

05:55.623 --> 05:58.091
Kerry.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.362
(gasps)

06:02.463 --> 06:04.197
(panting)

06:04.297 --> 06:05.466
Oh, Mother, Grandmother.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.435
It's come at last, the sickness.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.103
(distorted):
No!

06:10.203 --> 06:11.739
-Behind you!
-Where?

06:11.839 --> 06:13.273
(glitchy):
They're everywhere-everywhere.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.308
So many. Too many.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.444
(Gabrielle gasps)

06:19.480 --> 06:21.949
We have to get out
of this house.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.784
Come on. (panting)

06:27.788 --> 06:29.757
Okay.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.429
*

06:35.529 --> 06:36.730
(baby cries)

06:36.830 --> 06:39.633
(laughter echoes)

06:39.733 --> 06:42.402
Cary, what do we do?

06:42.503 --> 06:44.337
Cary.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.442
-(laughter echoes)
-Spaghetti.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.844
My brain is full of spaghetti.

06:50.944 --> 06:54.782
What is happening?
What is happening?

06:54.882 --> 06:56.784
-The world's ending.
-(laughter echoing)

06:56.884 --> 06:58.452
(baby cries)

06:58.552 --> 07:00.253
My world ended a long time ago.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.755
-I can't think. I...
-Yes, you can.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.357
-Cary.
-(whimpers)

07:04.458 --> 07:06.126
I...

07:09.597 --> 07:12.466
They consume time, yes?

07:12.566 --> 07:14.267
So, theoretically,
were someone to have

07:14.367 --> 07:17.638
twice the temporal identity,

07:17.738 --> 07:21.542
then that someone would be
twice as difficult to consume.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.144
(low growling)

07:24.244 --> 07:25.779
Like...

07:25.879 --> 07:28.549
like a loaf of bread
with two times as much yeast.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.351
-Or...
-So you want us to bake bread?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.453
Yeah, no. No, I...

07:33.554 --> 07:35.455
I have an idea.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.790
It may not stop them,

07:36.890 --> 07:38.792
but it will certainly
confuse them.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.803
Together.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.541
One more time.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.544
(distant ticking)

08:16.096 --> 08:18.098
(baby crying)

08:29.042 --> 08:31.411
I see it now.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.781
You're gods.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.016
I wish.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.453
(exhales sharply)

08:45.793 --> 08:47.695

08:47.795 --> 08:50.397
Oh, I love my job.

do it faster.

DAVID:
Your problem is you think

09:59.199 --> 10:00.600
this fight is one-on-one.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.535
You against me.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.205
But I'm not alone.
I am Legion.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.040
We all share one thing...

10:07.140 --> 10:08.608
DAVIDS (overlapping):
Monster, monster,

10:08.709 --> 10:10.811
monster, monster,
monster, monster...

10:10.911 --> 10:14.481
(overlapping voices continue)

10:18.051 --> 10:20.053
(voices distorting)

10:22.489 --> 10:25.793

monster, monster, monster!

10:25.893 --> 10:27.494
DAVID:
We hate you.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.698
Monster.

(knife unsheathes)

12:29.850 --> 12:32.152
(Farouk chuckles)

12:32.252 --> 12:34.754
Such a disappointment.

12:34.855 --> 12:38.125
We can make anything we fancy

12:38.225 --> 12:42.195
in this arena
of infinite promise,

12:42.295 --> 12:44.998
and this is what
we come up with?

12:45.098 --> 12:48.001
Weapons? War?

12:51.638 --> 12:56.043
Surely we have more imagination
than that.

CARY:
How are we doing?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.894
I can't talk. Killing.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.400
CARY:
Kerry? Is something wrong?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.335
-Kerry?
-(distant gunshots)

13:22.435 --> 13:24.571
No.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.140
-Nothing at all.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.699
AMAHL:
Do you know why
you have failed?

13:55.035 --> 13:59.339
Because under all your anger...

13:59.439 --> 14:02.275
there is a baby.

14:02.375 --> 14:07.014
Scared, small.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.382
Given away by his mother

14:09.482 --> 14:12.585
and father.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.523
A baby who is unloved,

14:16.623 --> 14:20.027
and knows that he's unloved.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.468
I'm a good person.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.907
I deserve love.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.409
AMAHL:
No, you don't.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.946

15:09.109 --> 15:11.111
*

15:15.182 --> 15:18.618
* Mother, do you think
they'll drop the bomb? *

15:31.498 --> 15:35.135
* Mother, do you think
they'll like this song? *

15:47.814 --> 15:52.719
* Mother, do you think they'll
try to break my balls? *

15:58.291 --> 16:02.962
* Ooh, ah *

16:03.063 --> 16:06.466
* Mother, should I
build the wall? *

16:11.704 --> 16:14.907
* Mother, should I run
for president? *

16:28.555 --> 16:31.558
* Mother, should I trust
the government? *

16:44.071 --> 16:46.206
* Mother, will they put me *

16:46.306 --> 16:49.276
* In the firing line? *

16:54.847 --> 16:59.252
* Ooh, ah *

16:59.352 --> 17:02.355
* Is it just a waste of time? *

17:07.860 --> 17:10.763
* Hush now, baby, baby *

17:10.863 --> 17:12.865
* Don't you cry *

17:16.969 --> 17:20.407
* Mama's gonna make
all of your nightmares *

17:20.507 --> 17:22.041
* Come true *

17:22.142 --> 17:25.478

all of her fears *

17:32.485 --> 17:35.155

17:35.255 --> 17:37.957
* But she might let you sing *

17:38.057 --> 17:40.927
* Mama's gonna keep baby *

17:41.027 --> 17:43.996
* Cozy and warm *

17:58.811 --> 18:00.613
* Ooh, baby *

18:00.713 --> 18:04.317
* Of course mama's gonna help
build the wall *

she's good enough *

18:43.890 --> 18:45.892
* For me? *

18:51.331 --> 18:54.734
* Mother, do you think
she's dangerous *

18:59.906 --> 19:01.908
* To me? *

19:07.547 --> 19:12.219
* Mother, will she tear
your little boy apart? *

19:18.358 --> 19:22.695
* Ooh, ah *

19:22.795 --> 19:25.398
* Mother, will she
break my heart? *

19:31.438 --> 19:34.173
* Hush now, baby, baby *

19:34.274 --> 19:36.909
* Don't you cry *

19:40.179 --> 19:42.215
* Mama's gonna check out *

19:42.315 --> 19:45.385
* All your girlfriends for you *

19:53.326 --> 19:56.195
* Until you get in *

19:56.296 --> 19:59.532
* Mama will always find out *

19:59.632 --> 20:01.368
* Where you've been *

20:01.468 --> 20:04.203
* Mama's gonna keep baby *

20:04.304 --> 20:07.106
* Healthy and clean *

20:10.710 --> 20:14.714
* Ooh, baby *

* Ooh, baby *

20:22.154 --> 20:24.090
* Ooh, baby *

20:24.190 --> 20:27.594
* You'll always be baby to me *

20:33.800 --> 20:35.735
* Mother, did it need *

20:35.835 --> 20:39.005
* To be so high? *

20:45.745 --> 20:47.013
GABRIELLE:
My boy.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.316
My beautiful boy.

(wind howling)

21:05.031 --> 21:07.033

21:18.445 --> 21:20.447
Time to die.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.706
(glass clinking)

21:52.812 --> 21:54.381
(laughter echoing)

21:57.417 --> 21:59.386
(glass shatters)

22:02.389 --> 22:04.724
(glass shatters)

22:10.763 --> 22:12.098
(rumbling continues)

22:12.198 --> 22:13.866
(gasping softly)

22:13.966 --> 22:15.668
(electrical buzzing)

22:23.075 --> 22:25.077
(squeaking)

22:43.530 --> 22:45.532
(gasping softly)

22:55.207 --> 22:57.209
(ticking)

22:59.746 --> 23:01.748
(low growling)

23:11.758 --> 23:13.760
*

23:54.801 --> 23:56.803
("Al Sharp"
by The Beta Band playing)

24:18.357 --> 24:23.229
* Is it because I'm beside
myself with love *

24:23.329 --> 24:25.832
* That I can't say
these things to you... *

24:30.036 --> 24:34.373
* Or is it because
I'm beside myself with guilt *

24:34.473 --> 24:37.810
* That I can't say
these things to you... *

24:41.313 --> 24:45.918
* Oh, you and me will never be *

24:46.018 --> 24:49.689
* Fine *

24:49.789 --> 24:53.860
* You and me will never be *

24:53.960 --> 24:57.564
* Fine... *

25:03.670 --> 25:05.672
(panting)

25:09.742 --> 25:12.579
(speaks Mandarin)

25:15.915 --> 25:18.851
* Is it because the life
beyond the heart *

25:18.951 --> 25:21.287
* Was taken out for good? *

25:21.387 --> 25:24.857
* Al Sharp, he got the money *

25:26.525 --> 25:30.062
* Or because the Power Ranger *

25:30.162 --> 25:32.264
* Robots in disguise *

25:32.364 --> 25:37.904
* Have called
a war to you, honey? *

25:38.004 --> 25:42.909
* You and me,
we'll never be fine... *

25:48.114 --> 25:52.151
I've lived in your son's mind
for 32 years.

25:53.753 --> 25:57.757
I saw what he saw,
I felt what he felt,

25:57.857 --> 26:02.094
I thought what he thought.

26:02.194 --> 26:08.067
And over time, what was once
a prison became a person.

26:09.936 --> 26:14.073
It's hard to hate someone
you understand.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.909
I love the boy, Charles.

26:17.009 --> 26:20.446
I consider him, uh, my...

26:20.546 --> 26:21.848
Son?

26:21.948 --> 26:23.750
(chuckles)

26:23.850 --> 26:27.787
Would that I could be
as strong a father as you are.

26:27.887 --> 26:31.624
But alas, it's not in my nature.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.125
(laughs softly)

26:40.599 --> 26:45.137
-May I be honest with you?
-Please.

26:45.237 --> 26:49.341
The man you met, the man I was,

26:49.441 --> 26:53.045
he brought you here
with base intentions.

26:53.145 --> 26:56.615
To dominate, to punish.

26:56.716 --> 27:01.320
Not because he was strong,
because he was weak.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.856
I was weak.

27:03.956 --> 27:08.294
Now I'm older
and weary of this churn.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.029
We call it...

27:13.800 --> 27:18.237
I did not come here
to defeat David,

27:18.337 --> 27:20.973
but to aid him in his quest.

27:23.743 --> 27:29.048
What I'm trying to say is...
I have changed.

27:44.596 --> 27:48.034
-Well, then I have
a proposition for you.
-Hmm.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.410
-CARY: Kerry?
-(gunshots)

27:58.510 --> 27:59.879
I don't feel so good.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.915
It's nothing. It's just a little
arthritis. We're still deadly.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.051
(distorted giggling)

28:05.151 --> 28:07.954
CARY:
I-I'm scared.
I don't want to die.

28:09.956 --> 28:11.223
There is no glory

28:11.323 --> 28:13.425
like the glory
of one last battle.

28:28.908 --> 28:29.909
(high-pitched whistling)

29:03.109 --> 29:06.078
*

29:51.223 --> 29:53.792
Please, Father,

29:53.893 --> 29:57.696
before we go, there's one
more thing I must do.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.836
(Amahl choking)

30:26.325 --> 30:28.260
David.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.329
Stop!

30:32.198 --> 30:34.200
(grunts, yells)

30:36.235 --> 30:38.170
I had him!

30:38.270 --> 30:40.339
-Yes, I saw the blood.
-What did you think,

30:40.439 --> 30:42.541
-I was gonna kill him
with words?
-David, stop.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.776
Listen to me, please.

30:44.877 --> 30:47.613
I see you. I do.

30:47.713 --> 30:50.249
You're trapped in a war that you
didn't start. This is my fault.

30:50.349 --> 30:54.020
I did this. You never had
a chance because of me.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.621
What... what are you saying?

30:55.721 --> 30:57.423
I'm saying that war
is not the answer.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.857
-(sighs)
-It's the problem.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.693
David, we don't need
this barbarism.

31:01.793 --> 31:03.695
-I've made a deal with Farouk.
-What...?

31:03.795 --> 31:05.697
Oh, you're saying we just leave?

31:05.797 --> 31:07.566
I'm saying that we respect
their right to exist

31:07.666 --> 31:09.868
-and they respect ours, yours.
-(scoffs)

31:09.969 --> 31:11.270
Isn't that what you want?

31:11.370 --> 31:13.772
-To be free?
-I...

31:13.872 --> 31:15.774
-Farouk will never go for that.
-He will.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.410
And what are we supposed to do,
take him at his word?

31:18.510 --> 31:21.047
We're telepaths. We never have
to take anyone at their word.

31:21.147 --> 31:22.881
I've... No,
I-I've come this far,

31:22.982 --> 31:25.384
and I can't just
leave it up to...

31:25.484 --> 31:27.653
David. David.

31:27.753 --> 31:30.089
I wasn't there for you.

31:30.189 --> 31:35.094
You needed me, your mother,
and we gave you away.

31:35.194 --> 31:39.298
I can't imagine doing it, but...

31:39.398 --> 31:44.636
I adore you, David,
and that will never change.

31:44.736 --> 31:48.340
I could only have done it
to protect you.

31:51.277 --> 31:53.279
I was a baby.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.684
I'll never know
what that's like,

31:58.784 --> 32:02.254
the pain of it, to be abandoned,

32:02.354 --> 32:05.857
but I am here now,

32:05.958 --> 32:09.695
and I want to make it right.

32:09.795 --> 32:14.000
So, please, my darling boy...

32:16.168 --> 32:18.170
...let me be your father.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.448
(sniffles, shudders)

32:39.225 --> 32:42.161
You have become soft
in your old age. (laughs)

32:42.261 --> 32:46.632
Was I really this bitter
and filled with hate?

32:46.732 --> 32:50.302
How petty you seem.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.138
Here.

32:52.238 --> 32:54.640
Let me show you
what I have learned.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.322
(whirring)

33:10.422 --> 33:13.092
My beautiful boy.

33:13.192 --> 33:15.394
YOUNG AMY:
Come on, king. Come on.

33:20.566 --> 33:23.535
DAVID:
"To bed, to bed,"
the mother said.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.837
(whistle blows)

33:28.074 --> 33:30.776
(glass shatters)

33:30.876 --> 33:33.379
(overlapping voices echoing)

33:35.013 --> 33:36.848
LENNY:
It's always blue.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.016
It's always blue.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.951
*

33:40.052 --> 33:43.089
DAVID:
You leave me alone! God!

33:44.090 --> 33:45.557
(man yelling)

33:45.657 --> 33:48.127
(indistinct whispering)

33:48.227 --> 33:49.795
LENNY:
Hold the phone. Is that...?

33:49.895 --> 33:51.063
Who's that?

33:51.163 --> 33:53.265
Why are the hot ones
always so crazy?

33:53.365 --> 33:54.933
MAN:
How does that make you feel?

33:55.033 --> 33:56.235
SYD:
We've got to get better.

33:56.335 --> 33:57.736
I was looking for you.

33:57.836 --> 34:01.073
David? No.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.041
YOUNG DAVID:
Trick or treat!

34:03.142 --> 34:04.276
LENNY:
They're coming for you...

34:04.376 --> 34:06.545
CLARK:
David!

34:09.548 --> 34:10.616
WOMAN:
Take my hand.

34:10.716 --> 34:11.950
(overlapping voices continue)

34:12.050 --> 34:13.985
SYD:
We can do together.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.761
Do you see?

34:22.861 --> 34:26.064
FAROUK:
You decide what is real
and what is not.

34:26.165 --> 34:27.833
DAVID:
This is you.

34:27.933 --> 34:29.735
FAROUK:
Seeing you like this,
what you have become.

34:29.835 --> 34:32.238
Boy undone by revenge.

34:46.118 --> 34:48.120
I'm sorry.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.670
(grunting)

35:04.770 --> 35:07.373
(crying)

35:07.473 --> 35:09.175
Stay behind me.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.477
(growling)

35:15.514 --> 35:17.516
(high-pitched whistle)

35:36.034 --> 35:38.036
(speaking Mandarin)

35:45.844 --> 35:47.479
How did you...

35:49.915 --> 35:53.485
Thank you.

35:53.585 --> 35:57.589
Sydney Barrett, Gabrielle Xavier

35:57.689 --> 36:01.327
and the infant David,

36:01.427 --> 36:04.396
the universe acknowledges you,

36:04.496 --> 36:09.000
that you exist and that
your existence is important.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.870
I can see that you've suffered,

36:11.970 --> 36:16.174
that people you love
have suffered,

36:16.275 --> 36:20.078
and you want to know
that it meant something.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.215
It did.

36:23.315 --> 36:25.217
It does.

36:25.317 --> 36:29.688
Nothing of value is ever lost.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.265
Did he do it?

36:40.266 --> 36:41.800
David?

36:41.900 --> 36:44.303
The David you know
is almost gone.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.572
His past changed.

36:46.672 --> 36:52.077
And now, Sydney Barrett,
your past will change, too.

36:52.177 --> 36:56.482
The life you've lived,
your memories,

36:56.582 --> 36:58.917
everything will be new.

37:06.792 --> 37:09.628
So I die?

37:11.297 --> 37:15.267
This you, the you you are now.

37:17.269 --> 37:20.171
But the you you will be?

37:20.272 --> 37:24.676
She will be... glorious.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.320
How do you...

37:34.420 --> 37:35.921
I am time.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.456
I see all.

37:41.427 --> 37:42.961
I like your jumper.

37:43.061 --> 37:45.597
Thank you.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.535
-So do I die now?
-No.

37:49.635 --> 37:53.004
I will give you time
for one last thing.

38:00.446 --> 38:02.548
(sighs)

38:02.648 --> 38:05.684
And thank you for helping me
when I was human.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.141
What just happened?

38:36.415 --> 38:38.584
I think we saved the world.

38:46.392 --> 38:49.728
So... a new beginning.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.364
What will you do?

38:53.365 --> 38:55.266
(chuckles softly)

38:55.367 --> 38:57.669
Be a baby.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.070
Then a boy.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.741
Then a man.

39:02.841 --> 39:06.344
(chuckles)
Well, when you're grown,

39:06.445 --> 39:07.913
come and see me.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.749
Together, we will
rule the world. (chuckles)

39:10.849 --> 39:13.885
Mm, no.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.388
I don't think I will.

39:17.956 --> 39:21.259
Ah, well...

39:21.359 --> 39:24.563
(low rumbling)

39:28.400 --> 39:30.402
(rumbling continues)

39:42.080 --> 39:44.049
(exhales)

39:46.985 --> 39:49.054
Okay.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.956
Now I'm ready.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.942
*

40:29.661 --> 40:31.663
(fire crackling)

40:46.277 --> 40:48.313
Look at you.

40:50.649 --> 40:53.218
I feel like
I look sophisticated.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.988
I was gonna say wise.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.219
(boy laughing)

41:28.319 --> 41:29.721
(model train chugging)

41:43.368 --> 41:46.071
(footsteps approaching)

41:46.171 --> 41:48.206
You okay, old man?

41:50.341 --> 41:52.177
(grunts softly)

41:55.280 --> 41:58.550
I don't think you
can call me that anymore, huh?

42:03.521 --> 42:04.923
Then...

42:07.793 --> 42:09.861
...how about brother?

42:13.932 --> 42:15.567
That works, my love.

42:21.139 --> 42:22.440
That works.

42:37.288 --> 42:39.290
(birds chirping)

42:54.172 --> 42:55.907
This world...

42:58.409 --> 43:01.446
...makes no sense
when you're not in it.

43:01.546 --> 43:03.982
I feel exactly the same way.

43:04.082 --> 43:07.352
-Is David...?
-No. He's upstairs.

43:07.452 --> 43:09.354
With his friends.

43:09.454 --> 43:11.489
Our baby has friends.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.824
Thank God.

43:13.859 --> 43:15.526
Are you all right?

43:15.627 --> 43:18.764
Do you ever think you
should have just let me sleep?

43:18.864 --> 43:21.032
In the hospital?

43:21.132 --> 43:23.201
Never.

43:23.301 --> 43:26.137
-I saw demons.
-Yes, you did.

43:27.605 --> 43:30.608
I saw a monkey with a king
in his head...

43:30.709 --> 43:31.943
(both chuckle)

43:33.011 --> 43:35.881
I saw our son as an adult...

43:35.981 --> 43:38.483
but so angry.

43:39.851 --> 43:41.486
And together we fought
a mad tyrant.

43:41.586 --> 43:43.621
So...

43:43.722 --> 43:45.791
demons--

43:45.891 --> 43:47.358
sounds like you got off
rather lightly.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.964
I can't do this without you.

43:53.064 --> 43:54.700
He needs us both.

43:57.568 --> 43:59.370
No more travel.

43:59.470 --> 44:02.207
No more bloodshed.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.876
You know, I've always wanted
to become a teacher.

44:07.478 --> 44:10.982
Are you gonna kiss me?

44:11.082 --> 44:13.584
-Abso-bloody-lutely.
-(chuckles)

44:20.091 --> 44:22.027
*

44:22.127 --> 44:24.595
(baby crying)

44:41.913 --> 44:43.915
*

44:58.196 --> 45:00.732
(baby cooing)

45:09.574 --> 45:10.742
Hey.

45:14.379 --> 45:15.613
Hey.

45:21.887 --> 45:25.590
Are you not surprised to see me?

45:25.690 --> 45:28.894
She told me. Switch.

45:30.328 --> 45:33.431
I get to do it all over again.

45:33.531 --> 45:35.834
This life.

45:35.934 --> 45:37.335
Yeah.

45:40.972 --> 45:44.475
And I bet you're gonna
turn out extraordinary.

45:46.244 --> 45:48.746
Without me around.

45:48.847 --> 45:50.748
Yeah.

45:50.849 --> 45:52.650
I am.

46:00.458 --> 46:02.093
Sorry.

46:10.035 --> 46:12.303
I like your mom.

46:14.472 --> 46:16.307
(chuckles softly)

46:16.407 --> 46:17.775
Yeah.

46:20.511 --> 46:22.513
I'm looking forward
to getting to know her.

46:25.683 --> 46:28.219
So now what? (sighs)

46:28.319 --> 46:30.721
We just sort of...

46:32.891 --> 46:35.460
Fade away.

46:35.560 --> 46:38.163
Into the ether.

46:43.534 --> 46:46.171
I have to say,
I didn't think you'd help me.

46:49.240 --> 46:51.309
I didn't.

46:53.979 --> 46:56.214
I helped him.

46:56.314 --> 46:58.316
(baby cooing)

47:03.889 --> 47:05.891
David.

47:05.991 --> 47:07.825
Yeah?

47:11.262 --> 47:13.498
Be a good boy.

47:23.608 --> 47:26.277
(both chuckle softly)

47:32.117 --> 47:34.752

47:46.864 --> 47:49.100
("Happy Jack"
by The Who playing)

47:52.103 --> 47:55.740
* Happy Jack wasn't old,
but he was a man *

47:58.776 --> 48:01.947
* He lived in the sand
at the Isle of Man *

48:06.417 --> 48:09.454
* The kids would all sing,
he would take the wrong key *

48:09.554 --> 48:11.923
* La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la... *

48:12.023 --> 48:15.293
* So they rode on his head
in their furry donkey *

48:15.393 --> 48:18.729
* La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la... *

48:23.834 --> 48:27.805
* The kids couldn't hurt Jack,
they tried, tried, tried *

48:27.905 --> 48:29.807
* They dropped things
on his back *

48:29.907 --> 48:33.078
* They lied, lied, lied,
lied, lied *

48:35.013 --> 48:37.915
* But they couldn't stop Jack,
or the waters lapping *

48:38.016 --> 48:40.685
* La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la... *

48:40.785 --> 48:44.422
* And they couldn't prevent Jack
from being happy *

48:44.522 --> 48:46.457
* La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la *

49:00.671 --> 49:04.442
* And they couldn't prevent Jack
from being happy. *
