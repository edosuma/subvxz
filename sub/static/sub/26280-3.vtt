WEBVTT

00:02.785 --> 00:04.439
So, Penny, we were talking
to our neighbors,

00:04.482 --> 00:06.702
and they'’re thinking of moving
and selling their house.

00:06.745 --> 00:07.616
Really? Why?

00:07.659 --> 00:09.009
Something about
babies crying

00:09.052 --> 00:10.140
and keeping them up all night;
it'’s not important.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.837
You guys should totally
take a look at it.

00:11.881 --> 00:12.708
[laughs]

00:12.751 --> 00:14.101
Then we could be neighbors.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.493
Hey. Wait a minute,
what about us?

00:15.537 --> 00:16.799
I mean, we'’re married now.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.322
Maybe we want to buy
the house next door.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.063
Well, Amy, we can'’t move.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.674
I'’d have to change all
the tags in my underwear.

00:23.632 --> 00:24.894
You can buy new ones.

00:24.937 --> 00:26.330
What-- new house, new
underwear. What am I,

00:26.374 --> 00:28.593
in the Witness
Protection Program?

00:28.637 --> 00:31.074
Okay. Guys,
so what do you think?

00:31.118 --> 00:33.555
Well, I don'’t know,
w-we'’re pretty happy here.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.383
Yeah. Plus, if we moved,
we'’d probably just get

00:35.426 --> 00:36.906
a loft downtown.

00:36.949 --> 00:40.127
Really? I always figured
we'’d get a place with a yard.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.519
Oh, sure, yeah,
that makes sense,

00:41.563 --> 00:43.173
so you could shoot hoops
and mow the lawn?

00:45.175 --> 00:47.308
How are you two married?

00:47.351 --> 00:48.526
You were there.
I wore her down.

00:48.570 --> 00:49.875
He did.

00:49.919 --> 00:52.052
You guys should'’ve talked
about all this stuff

00:52.095 --> 00:53.662
while you were dating.

00:53.705 --> 00:57.013
I mean, me and Anu already know
so much about each other.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.102
Wait, I forget,
is Anu your waxer?

00:59.146 --> 01:00.756
Uh, no, that'’s Annette.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.846
Anu is the woman
my father fixed me up with.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.500
We'’re going
on our first date tomorrow.

01:05.543 --> 01:08.198
Which reminds me,
I need to see Annette.

01:08.242 --> 01:11.114
You'’re really letting your
father pick out a wife?

01:11.158 --> 01:12.724
Why not?

01:12.768 --> 01:15.205
Arranged marriages have been
working for thousands of years.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.207
Anu and I come
from similar backgrounds,

01:17.251 --> 01:19.035
our families get along
and we each

01:19.079 --> 01:20.819
filled out questionnaires, so we
know we'’re not wasting our time

01:20.863 --> 01:22.865
with someone
who'’s not compatible.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.780
Oh, that sounds so dry
and clinical.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.477
You lucky duck.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.698
I just don'’t think you
can truly know someone

01:29.741 --> 01:31.526
until you'’ve spent a
lot of time with them.

01:31.569 --> 01:33.702
Really? What'’s Penny's
dream vacation?

01:33.745 --> 01:38.185
Uh, Malibu beach house.

01:38.228 --> 01:41.536
That'’s Barbie's
dream vacation.

01:41.579 --> 01:44.713
Maybe you should send us
that questionnaire.

Fine, I'’m shopping on my phone.

02:24.753 --> 02:27.234
You'’re the one who said
you wanted to read more.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.497

I only feed the kids organic.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.112
Hey.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.331
How was your night?

02:37.374 --> 02:39.463
Ah, it was great.
We went to an improv show.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.465
Yeah. They asked the
audience to suggest a word,

02:41.509 --> 02:42.814
and they used Stuart'’s.

02:42.858 --> 02:43.989
Oh, cool, what was it?

02:44.033 --> 02:45.817
Coconuts.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.906
It was such a good one.

02:47.950 --> 02:50.082
[chuckles]
It just came to me.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.476
Uh, what are you guys up to?Reading.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.435
Oh, nice, I wish
I read more.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.915
Well, if it'’s important,
you find the time.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.180
You want to see my room?

03:00.223 --> 03:01.181
Yeah.
Cool.

03:03.661 --> 03:06.186
[quietly]:
How do you feel about this?

03:06.229 --> 03:09.319
That she can clearly do better,
but that'’s not for me to say.

03:09.363 --> 03:12.670
No, with them in his room,
doing stuff.

03:12.714 --> 03:13.889
Oh, come on, we'’re sitting
right out here.

03:29.121 --> 03:32.386
Wow, you really are
good at this.

03:32.429 --> 03:35.389
Well, I'’ve spent a lot of time
painting D&Dminiatures.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.827
I know that makes you want
to rip my shirt off,

03:38.870 --> 03:40.045
but wait until
your nails are dry.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.873
[phone chimes]

03:41.917 --> 03:43.745
Oh, it'’s Raj.

03:43.788 --> 03:46.313
He sent us that Indian marriage
questionnaire.

03:46.356 --> 03:49.229
Ooh, read one.Okay.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.360
"How religious are you?"

03:50.404 --> 03:52.275
That'’s easy, both of us:
not at all.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.495
No, I wouldn'’t say not at all.
I mean, I am pretty spiritual.

03:54.538 --> 03:57.062
I do go to yoga, so...

03:57.106 --> 04:01.066
Great, so your church is
Our Lady of the Stretchy Pants.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.026
Next question.

04:04.069 --> 04:05.941
Uh, "how close are you
with your family?"

04:05.984 --> 04:07.247
Pretty close.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.378
I'’m gonna say not too close,

04:08.422 --> 04:10.859
but I'’m hoping to get farther.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.296
How do you feel
about children?

04:13.340 --> 04:14.863
Um, they'’re okay, I guess.

04:14.906 --> 04:18.649
I mean, if I saw one,
I wouldn'’t throw a rock at it.

04:18.693 --> 04:22.958
W-Why would you throw
a rock at a child?

04:23.001 --> 04:25.917
[chuckles]:
I just said I wouldn'’t.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.833
The question is would you
like to have kids.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.357
So, yeah, we want kids.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.706
Yeah-- someday.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.229
Right, like,
in the next five years.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.753
Sure, uh, next question.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.277
"How are you with pets?"

04:37.320 --> 04:39.757
Well, I did take care
of Sheldon for 15 years,

04:39.801 --> 04:42.456
and he only bit me twice.

04:45.372 --> 04:48.331
I have to say, uh, after reading
your questionnaire,

04:48.375 --> 04:50.942
I feel like I already know you.

04:50.986 --> 04:53.380
Totally. Me, too. Excuse me.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.164
Can we please get
sparkling instead of tap,

04:55.207 --> 04:56.774
some clean silverware
and find out

04:56.818 --> 04:58.733
what they'’re having?
That looks delicious.

04:58.776 --> 04:59.864
Yes, ma'’am.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.257
Thank you.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.085
So, you'’re an astrophysicist.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.521
Yes, ma'’am.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.307
I-I mean, uh, just yes.

05:07.350 --> 05:08.960
U-Unless you prefer "ma'’am."

05:09.004 --> 05:11.136
I don'’t.Good, because you don'’t
seem like a ma'’am.

05:11.180 --> 05:14.966
You seem more
like a sweet thang.

05:15.010 --> 05:18.318
Wow. You are not good at this.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.754
[chuckles]
Well, if I was good at this,

05:19.797 --> 05:21.843
I wouldn'’t need
to be fixed up by my father.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.714
I never thought I'’d let
my family set me up, either,

05:23.758 --> 05:25.934
but I'’m 34,
I'’d like to have kids

05:25.977 --> 05:27.805
and it'’s hard to date
because I work so much.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.807
Oh, yes, uh, you'’re a concierge.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.636
For now. I plan to be managing
a hotel in the next five years.

05:32.680 --> 05:36.161
Four, if I can get the current
manager out of the way.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.990
He'’s a smoker,
so fingers crossed.

05:39.034 --> 05:42.385
I-I get it. You know, um,
I used to have a long list

05:42.429 --> 05:43.908
of what I wanted from a wife.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.432
Uh, eyes like

05:45.475 --> 05:48.260
Sandra Bullock,
hair like Sandra Bullock,

05:48.304 --> 05:50.350
and the bravery of Ryan Stone.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.308
That'’s Sandra Bullock's
character in Gravity.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.092
But now,

05:54.136 --> 05:56.007
I-I just want someone nice.

05:56.051 --> 05:58.619
I think I'’m nice. Are you nice?

05:58.662 --> 06:00.229
Oh, I'’m definitely nice.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.449
Every time a girl breaks up
with me she always starts with,

06:02.492 --> 06:04.320
"You'’re a nice guy."

06:05.539 --> 06:08.237
Look, your whole sweet,
insecure thing is cute,

06:08.280 --> 06:10.500
but honestly,
I have no time for that.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.893
If you'’re not
serious about this,

06:11.936 --> 06:13.416
you need to walk away now.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.418
I-I am serious.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.289
Good.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.769
Okay.
[chuckles]

06:18.813 --> 06:21.206
O-Okay, w-what does this mean?

06:21.250 --> 06:24.079
I think it means I might be
the future Mrs....

06:24.122 --> 06:26.081

06:26.124 --> 06:29.345
How would you feel
if I didn'’t change my name?

06:29.389 --> 06:32.392
A little hurt, but you wouldn'’t
know, because I'’m too nice.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.874
Hey, want to get lunch?

06:36.918 --> 06:38.572
I can'’t.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.138
Halley and Michael were up all
night, and I'’m way behind here.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.053
Oh, no, are they sick?No.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.621
They were just laughing and
playing like a couple of jerks.

06:46.275 --> 06:49.496
Boy, they'’re cute,
but they ruin everything.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.106
I get that.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.455
You know,
I'’ve been thinking lately

06:52.499 --> 06:54.979
that maybe I don'’t want kids.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.416
Are you crazy?

06:56.459 --> 06:58.809
Of course you want them.
It'’s amazing.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.811
You just said
they ruin everything.

07:00.855 --> 07:03.597
I'’m allowed to. It's their fault
I pee when I laugh.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.338
Hang on, why is it crazy

07:06.382 --> 07:07.818
to say I might not want kids?

07:07.862 --> 07:08.993
Oh, it'’s not crazy.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.908
It'’s just wrong.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.867
You only think
you don'’t want kids,

07:12.910 --> 07:16.174
but once you have kids, you'’ll
realize that you did want them.

07:16.218 --> 07:20.440
Or I don'’t want them, so I won't
have them, so back off.

07:20.483 --> 07:23.138
Aw, you sound just like me
before I became a mom

07:23.181 --> 07:25.662
and learned
what the meaning of love was.

07:25.706 --> 07:28.883
Wow, I cannot believe how
condescending you'’re being.

07:28.926 --> 07:32.669
Look, I know it'’s scary,
but you'’re gonna be a great mom.

07:32.713 --> 07:35.193
I know I'’d be great, but the
point is I don'’t want to be one.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.631
Maybe you wouldn'’t be great.
You kind of got a temper.

07:37.674 --> 07:41.635
You know, not everyone needs
to have kids to be fulfilled.

07:41.678 --> 07:44.681
You'’re right,
you'’ve got Leonard.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.640
What more do you need?

07:49.338 --> 07:50.470
Hey, guys.Hello.
Hey.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.123
How was your date?

07:52.167 --> 07:54.343
Ah, let me answer that
with a question.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.301
How would you like to be
my best man?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.217
[laughs softly]
Wait, you'’re not seriously

07:59.261 --> 08:00.871
marrying a woman
you'’ve met once.

08:00.915 --> 08:04.092
Why not? She'’s nice, I'm nice.

08:04.135 --> 08:06.921
We'’re just as likely to be happy
as any other two people.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.270
Maybe even happier.

08:08.313 --> 08:09.880
Sorry, that was not
a swipe at you.

08:12.274 --> 08:14.232
I didn'’t think it was.

08:14.276 --> 08:15.886
Yeah, good, '’cause it was not.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.540
SHELDON:
Well, I, for one,

08:17.584 --> 08:20.282
applaud Raj'’s decision to
forgo emotional attachment

08:20.325 --> 08:22.589
and find a life
partner by bowing

08:22.632 --> 08:25.809
to a 3,000-year-old
authoritarian tradition.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.071
What are you talking about?

08:27.115 --> 08:28.551
You married a woman
you'’re in love with.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.249
I can'’t believe you're throwing
that back in my face.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.470
Why can'’t you just be
happy for me?

08:34.514 --> 08:35.906
Because you'’re being dumb.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.473
You don'’t know anything
about her.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.083
W-Well, how come you all
get to be married

08:39.127 --> 08:40.824
and I have to stay single?

08:40.868 --> 08:43.392
I think that'’s a question
for a licensed professional.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.873
You know what, you'’re not
just insulting me.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.440
Okay? You'’re insulting
my family, my culture

08:48.484 --> 08:50.138
and my future bride, Anu,

08:50.181 --> 08:52.401
