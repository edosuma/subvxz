00:03.677 --> 00:05.906
<i>Mr Flender, please come in.
Your car is ready.</i>

00:05.930 --> 00:07.689
Owen, what do you think?

00:08.307 --> 00:09.566
Wow!

00:10.476 --> 00:11.860
She's a beauty.

00:11.936 --> 00:12.954
A beauty.

00:12.978 --> 00:14.790
Black is definitely
the way to go.

00:14.814 --> 00:16.114
Definitely.

00:16.273 --> 00:18.575
Yeah. I think this
is the one, Bay.

00:19.693 --> 00:22.329
I don't know, guys. I mean, maybe
this is a little too flashy.

00:22.863 --> 00:27.000
A station wagon, on the other hand,
would be... Much more practical.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

00:41.382 --> 00:42.516
Bailey!

00:42.841 --> 00:44.017
Bailey!

01:28.262 --> 01:29.948
Plain or pepperoni?

01:29.972 --> 01:32.524
Plain. Um, no, pepperoni.

01:35.102 --> 01:37.414
No one put it in the fridge.
I hate it when it's not cold.

01:37.438 --> 01:38.864
Throw it in the freezer.

01:40.232 --> 01:42.085
You can stuff pizza down
the disposal, right?

01:42.109 --> 01:43.253
Just getting home, Charlie?

01:43.277 --> 01:45.245
I crashed at Doug's last night.

01:45.571 --> 01:47.674
Has anyone seen the detergent?
I gotta do a wash.

01:47.698 --> 01:49.509
Seems like the only time
we see you around here

01:49.533 --> 01:50.802
is when you run
out of underwear.

01:50.826 --> 01:52.929
You didn't by any chance
go shopping, did you?

01:52.953 --> 01:54.671
I got diapers. I got wipes.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.173
Unscented, right?

01:56.206 --> 01:57.341
Yes.

01:57.708 --> 01:59.769
So I guess I'm up for
babysitting detail tonight.

01:59.793 --> 02:01.605
Hey, what's with the
Jeep in the driveway?

02:01.629 --> 02:03.732
"I saw Sarah Good
with the devil.

02:03.756 --> 02:06.109
"I saw Goody Osborne
with the devil.

02:06.133 --> 02:08.352
I saw Bridget Bishop with the... "

02:08.509 --> 02:11.104
School play. I'm gonna audition.

02:11.430 --> 02:12.898
Pepperoni, please.

02:14.016 --> 02:15.160
What's with the Jeep?

02:15.184 --> 02:16.912
What are you talking about?
That's the new car.

02:16.936 --> 02:18.580
That's the car I
co-signed a lease for?

02:18.604 --> 02:20.290
I thought you were
getting a station wagon.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.459
A station wagon is
transportation, but a Jeep...

02:22.483 --> 02:24.336
- Says "Bailey's arrived."
- Right.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.963
It's my birthday present,
courtesy of you.

02:26.987 --> 02:28.455
Speaking of which...

02:34.119 --> 02:35.963
The Cowboys and the Niners?

02:36.413 --> 02:37.965
Take someone special.

02:41.794 --> 02:43.053
Forget it.

02:44.129 --> 02:45.347
Mrs. Kelleher!

02:46.340 --> 02:47.599
Mrs. Kelleher?

02:48.175 --> 02:49.893
Is something wrong, Mrs.
Kelleher?

02:49.968 --> 02:52.396
I'm going to be 65
years old tomorrow.

02:52.513 --> 02:54.324
No kidding? Congratulations.

02:54.348 --> 02:57.109
It's 52 steps up
to the front door.

02:57.184 --> 02:58.995
It's two flights
up to the bedroom,

02:59.019 --> 03:00.914
and when I take your
brother to the park,

03:00.938 --> 03:03.991
I have to push his stroller
up a 45-degree incline.

03:04.024 --> 03:05.877
Gee, Mrs. Kelleher,
this is San Francisco.

03:05.901 --> 03:08.129
I mean, I really don't know
what I can do about the hills.

03:08.153 --> 03:10.288
My knees just can't
take any more of this.

03:10.364 --> 03:14.543
Mrs. Kelleher, I've got this really important
paper due today and I am incredibly late.

03:14.993 --> 03:17.838
Could you please, please,
just hold out until tonight?

03:17.996 --> 03:20.090
Then I promise we'll
work everything out.

03:23.961 --> 03:25.387
Owen, what are you...

03:26.839 --> 03:28.682
I just folded this stuff.

03:32.261 --> 03:34.771
What are you doing just sitting there?
Could you watch him?

03:35.097 --> 03:36.574
Char, I've been watching him.

03:36.598 --> 03:38.994
Could you watch him while I
find someone else to watch him?

03:39.018 --> 03:40.412
What do you need,
like, 20 minutes?

03:40.436 --> 03:41.903
No, like, tomorrow.

03:42.604 --> 03:44.165
Don't you think we'll have
hired someone by then?

03:44.189 --> 03:45.583
Hey, man, news flash.

03:45.607 --> 03:48.577
This isn't like ordering a pizza.
This takes time.

03:48.694 --> 03:51.079
I'll blow off practice if
you can't stay past 3:00.

03:53.323 --> 03:55.292
Look, the thing is, is I
can't stay at all tomorrow.

03:56.118 --> 03:58.086
Doug and I got a
house-painting gig.

03:58.829 --> 04:01.506
It's the first thing I've had since
last week, and it's pretty good money.

04:02.833 --> 04:05.552
You'd just better hope there's a
Domino's nanny agency out there.

04:07.963 --> 04:09.024
Great.

04:09.048 --> 04:10.775
<i>...been disconnected
for nonpayment.</i>

04:10.799 --> 04:12.559
<i>Contact your local...</i>

04:15.137 --> 04:16.688
Why didn't you pay the bill?

04:17.305 --> 04:18.940
Why didn't I pay the bill?

04:20.726 --> 04:22.319
Why didn't I pay the bill?

04:24.438 --> 04:29.117
Remember, if you show the process by
which you arrive at your results,

04:29.193 --> 04:33.205
even if the answer is wrong, I
will be awarding partial credit.

05:07.064 --> 05:09.375
It's funny how you see
someone every day.

05:09.399 --> 05:11.701
I mean, you're one
stupid row away,

05:11.985 --> 05:15.038
and you never
really notice them.

05:15.948 --> 05:17.457
I noticed you.

05:19.409 --> 05:20.345
You did?

05:20.369 --> 05:22.003
Yeah. I, uh...

05:22.663 --> 05:24.923
...copied off you
in health class...

05:25.666 --> 05:26.883
Twice.

05:27.167 --> 05:28.468
Great.

05:31.004 --> 05:33.140
No, thanks, I quit.

05:33.549 --> 05:36.444
All that research on secondary
smoke, it just seemed wrong.

05:36.468 --> 05:38.029
Not that it isn't a
personal choice.

05:38.053 --> 05:39.155
Do you want to go out sometime?

05:39.179 --> 05:40.397
Uh-huh.

05:41.890 --> 05:43.316
Whenever you want.

05:45.143 --> 05:47.247
What if I said I
wanted to show you

05:47.271 --> 05:49.865
the middle of the Golden Gate
bridge at 3:00 in the morning?

05:51.316 --> 05:52.534
I'll be there.

05:53.443 --> 05:54.921
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

05:54.945 --> 05:56.246
What about your folks?

05:56.446 --> 05:57.706
Don't they...

05:58.949 --> 06:00.584
Oh, right, I heard.

06:00.701 --> 06:02.720
Car accident. About
six months ago.

06:02.744 --> 06:04.921
Yeah. I don't want
to talk about it.

06:06.290 --> 06:07.976
My dad split a couple years ago.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.384
It's not the same thing.

06:13.130 --> 06:14.190
Guess not.

06:14.214 --> 06:15.432
Yeah.

06:19.595 --> 06:21.229
So whenever I want, huh?

06:22.764 --> 06:24.649
No one tells me what to do.

06:49.583 --> 06:50.935
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.427
I've got something for you.

06:53.211 --> 06:54.346
This?

06:54.463 --> 06:57.108
The William T. Foster
classical competition?

06:57.132 --> 06:58.934
Yeah. It's an application.

06:59.009 --> 07:00.695
I think we should enter you.

07:00.719 --> 07:03.605
It's in January, though, which
means there's not much time.

07:04.848 --> 07:07.201
We could add another day after school.
What do you think?

07:07.225 --> 07:08.369
Another day?

07:08.393 --> 07:10.570
Yeah. We'd get the
Vivaldi into shape.

07:10.646 --> 07:12.531
I won the Melchior with Vivaldi.

07:12.689 --> 07:13.865
What do you think?

07:15.025 --> 07:17.619
Uh, they're doing <i>The
Crucible</i> at school...

07:17.819 --> 07:18.995
For Christmas.

07:19.863 --> 07:21.132
I was gonna audition.

07:21.156 --> 07:23.259
Oh, yeah? Since when do you
want to be an actress, kiddo?

07:23.283 --> 07:24.459
I don't.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.054
It's just that
everybody's trying out,

07:26.078 --> 07:28.797
and maybe I could get a
small part or something.

07:29.039 --> 07:32.759
I thought it would be,
well, you know, fun.

07:33.210 --> 07:34.803
The thing is, Claud,

07:35.170 --> 07:38.473
if you work really hard
on this, I know...

07:38.632 --> 07:40.892
I just know you're
good enough to win.

07:48.684 --> 07:50.277
Hey, you want to
watch the corner?

07:50.644 --> 07:52.279
What's eating you?

07:52.813 --> 07:54.281
What, like you don't know?

07:54.523 --> 07:56.668
All right, he's late. I
mean, I know he's late.

07:56.692 --> 07:58.086
Howard's like that.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.504
Oh yeah? Great.

07:59.528 --> 08:00.922
Maybe you should
have said something

08:00.946 --> 08:02.674
before we both forked
over 12,000 bucks

08:02.698 --> 08:04.133
and trusted him to
arrange this thing.

08:04.157 --> 08:05.500
Wanna toss me the tarp?

08:06.243 --> 08:07.679
The bank's gotta
be closed by now.

08:07.703 --> 08:09.138
I wanted to have all the
papers signed today.

08:09.162 --> 08:10.598
The place should be ours today.

08:10.622 --> 08:12.100
This is a business
relationship, Charlie.

08:12.124 --> 08:14.467
I mean, we gotta be flexible
with these things, you know?

08:14.626 --> 08:15.853
We'll sign the papers tomorrow.

08:15.877 --> 08:17.855
You know what? I don't want to
hear it, okay? He's your friend.

08:17.879 --> 08:19.889
He said he'd be here
three hours ago.

08:20.424 --> 08:21.442
I thought you called him.

08:21.466 --> 08:23.476
I did. He said he was
coming down here.

08:23.802 --> 08:24.904
That makes me nervous.

08:24.928 --> 08:25.947
Well, Howard's like that.

08:25.971 --> 08:27.073
Would you stop?

08:27.097 --> 08:29.441
Is everything okay? Is
there a problem, Charlie?

08:29.683 --> 08:33.203
Everything's fine, Mrs. Elleson. We'll
be back tomorrow morning to finish up.

08:33.227 --> 08:34.613
Good. Bye.

08:35.563 --> 08:37.542
I want to have the time to do
really good work in that place,

08:37.566 --> 08:38.501
something we can be proud of.

08:38.525 --> 08:41.119
I don't want to lose time while
this guy jerks us around.

08:41.153 --> 08:43.330
Will you relax? He'll show up.

08:46.950 --> 08:49.971
Well, your verticals
are shot to hell.

08:49.995 --> 08:52.932
I tried to snake 'em, but
they're thin as toilet paper.

08:52.956 --> 08:55.008
I'm surprised they
haven't burst already.

08:55.208 --> 08:57.469
I'm gonna have to do
some major re-piping.

08:59.129 --> 09:00.315
What's with him?

09:00.339 --> 09:01.681
He's a little moody.

09:02.674 --> 09:04.726
Look, is this gonna
be expensive?

09:05.093 --> 09:08.605
Conservative estimate?
600 bucks.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.650
I'm gonna need half of that up
front to pay for materials.

09:12.017 --> 09:13.485
A check would be just dandy.

09:20.650 --> 09:21.993
Wait a second.

09:22.569 --> 09:24.704
What happened to check 917?

09:26.281 --> 09:28.625
Plus we have a $35 balance.

09:29.493 --> 09:30.960
Excuse me, um...

09:31.411 --> 09:33.931
Is there any way that you
could get started now

09:33.955 --> 09:36.966
and then we could get you
a check, like, tomorrow?

09:37.167 --> 09:39.103
Sorry, gang. That's
not the way I work.

09:39.127 --> 09:40.730
Um, tell you what.

09:40.754 --> 09:43.306
You give me a call when your
folks get back into town, okay?

09:43.507 --> 09:46.559
I'll just need 50,
for the estimate.

09:48.095 --> 09:49.354
Cash would be dandy.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.244
All I'm saying is,

09:55.268 --> 09:57.830
is there's no way we're going
to make the next 15,000 bucks

09:57.854 --> 10:00.583
last four months if all
of us are writing checks.

10:00.607 --> 10:01.751
And leasing Jeeps.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.076
I like the Jeep.

10:03.693 --> 10:06.672
My point is, is that I
could have swung the jeep

10:06.696 --> 10:09.092
and the phone bill and the
plumber and everything

10:09.116 --> 10:10.802
if I'd known what everyone
else was spending.

10:10.826 --> 10:12.136
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.962
That's not the problem, Bailey.

10:14.037 --> 10:15.473
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

10:15.497 --> 10:17.767
The problem is we've got 35
bucks left in our account.

10:17.791 --> 10:21.354
Hey, if it isn't the Salinger clan,
right on time Where does the week go?

10:21.378 --> 10:22.647
Hey, Joe. Is Julia here?

10:22.671 --> 10:25.900
Haven't seen her. Claudia, leave room
for dessert. I got your dad's mud pie.

10:25.924 --> 10:26.901
Great.

10:26.925 --> 10:27.902
Face it, Bay.

10:27.926 --> 10:30.363
It's a mistake to hand you guys the
next four-month chunk all at once.

10:30.387 --> 10:32.188
Not when you don't know
how to make it last.

10:32.222 --> 10:36.526
Oh, really, Mr. "Can You Spot
Me 20 Till I Get A Job"?

10:36.685 --> 10:37.986
Where is she?

10:40.021 --> 10:43.074
Look, I'll go to the bank
tomorrow and I'll get 2,500,

10:43.442 --> 10:45.545
but that's gotta last you
till the end of the month.

10:45.569 --> 10:48.288
That's the way we're gonna do it
from now on, one month at a time.

10:48.363 --> 10:50.508
Wait a second. Since when
is that your decision?

10:50.532 --> 10:54.137
As the executor of the estate, Mr. Graham
worked it so that I'm the legal guardian.

10:54.161 --> 10:55.346
Yeah, on paper.

10:55.370 --> 10:57.432
You're our legal guardian
on paper, Charlie.

10:57.456 --> 10:59.382
And only because
someone had to be.

11:01.168 --> 11:02.520
The fact of the matter is,

11:02.544 --> 11:04.971
is you guys have spent practically
every cent you've got.

11:05.213 --> 11:07.515
It's true, Bailey.
I'm not blaming you.

11:07.591 --> 11:10.602
I mean, what do a bunch of kids
know about managing money, huh?

11:10.927 --> 11:12.479
Are we in trouble?

11:13.471 --> 11:14.647
Bailey?

11:15.015 --> 11:17.743
Look, Mr. Graham gives me the
check three times a year,

11:17.767 --> 11:20.445
so it's up to me to say how
the money's doled out.

11:21.897 --> 11:24.699
I'm, I'm sorry, guys.
That's just the way it is.

11:45.337 --> 11:46.606
Where were you?

11:46.630 --> 11:49.015
Union Square. Shopping.
What do you think?

11:49.883 --> 11:52.477
Better not have paid for
that with check 917.

11:52.969 --> 11:55.313
I paid for it with my own
money, thank you very much.

11:55.805 --> 11:57.357
It's for tomorrow night.

11:59.017 --> 12:00.610
I've got a date.

12:02.187 --> 12:03.456
This guy in trig...

12:03.480 --> 12:04.415
P.K.?

12:04.439 --> 12:06.032
You missed dinner, you know.

12:06.816 --> 12:08.336
That's okay I'll grab something.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.869
You know what I mean, Julia.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.547
You missed dinner.

12:11.571 --> 12:13.414
So what? It's not the
end of the world.

12:14.532 --> 12:16.709
It's the one thing we
agreed to do together.

12:17.035 --> 12:18.211
Why?

12:18.286 --> 12:20.264
So we can hang around Dad's
restaurant twice a week

12:20.288 --> 12:22.257
and eat with napkins
instead of paper towels?

12:22.415 --> 12:24.092
That's about being a family?

12:24.125 --> 12:26.177
It's about checking
in with each other,

12:26.503 --> 12:28.388
making sure we all
still have a pulse.

12:30.257 --> 12:33.560
Yeah. Still beating. Satisfied?

12:34.761 --> 12:38.699
No! No, no, no. I...
no, I totally agree.

12:38.723 --> 12:43.653
The right qualifications are key but immediate
availability is also a top priority.

12:45.105 --> 12:48.408
Wha... I'm sorry. What was
that about an agency fee?

12:49.859 --> 12:53.705
N-no. No. No. That seems very...
reasonable.

12:54.322 --> 12:57.208
Can I call you back?
Okay. Thanks.

12:57.659 --> 13:01.379
- An agency fee?
- 15% of a full year's salary.

13:02.622 --> 13:04.809
Uh, what choice do
we have, though?

13:04.833 --> 13:06.686
I mean, the department
of social services says

13:06.710 --> 13:09.846
Owen's gotta have a qualified
nanny, so whatever it costs...

13:15.260 --> 13:16.394
How much?

13:18.930 --> 13:20.199
Two seventy five.

13:20.223 --> 13:23.610
That's all? I mean, look at this.
It's worth way more than that.

13:23.727 --> 13:25.069
Not to me.

13:25.603 --> 13:27.822
The bow's got real
mother of pearl.

13:28.106 --> 13:29.699
And you can have the case.

13:30.692 --> 13:31.868
Six hundred.

13:32.193 --> 13:34.078
I'll go 350. That's it.

13:40.035 --> 13:41.294
Okay.

13:41.536 --> 13:42.754
Okay.

13:47.375 --> 13:48.760
There you go.

13:53.381 --> 13:54.932
Here's your ticket.

14:09.564 --> 14:11.741
You're not gonna put it
in the window, are you?

14:13.026 --> 14:15.119
Could you put it
somewhere in the back...

14:15.320 --> 14:17.288
Just so it doesn't
sell right away?

14:18.782 --> 14:19.717
Yeah.

14:19.741 --> 14:21.334
Okay. Thanks.

14:23.203 --> 14:26.589
The agency told me
about your situation.

14:26.623 --> 14:28.216
I'd love to help.

14:32.462 --> 14:35.348
Uh, don't mind him.
He's in a mood.

14:36.675 --> 14:37.568
Hmm.

14:37.592 --> 14:39.519
Look, when can you start?

14:39.928 --> 14:42.814
I have a few questions, first.

14:44.265 --> 14:49.529
I think it's essential that my child-rearing
philosophy coincides with the family's.

14:51.314 --> 14:55.586
I believe in allowing a child
to progress at his own pace

14:55.610 --> 14:59.122
with an emphasis on
building self-esteem.

14:59.155 --> 15:02.125
That would be great.
Self-esteem would be great.

15:03.243 --> 15:05.253
What about potty training?

15:05.829 --> 15:09.141
Actually, my sister Claudia handles
most of the poop around here,

15:09.165 --> 15:11.300
so, you ought to ask
her that question.

15:12.794 --> 15:16.305
Have you read any Piaget?

15:17.340 --> 15:18.891
Piaget...

15:20.510 --> 15:22.854
Tell me how it starts.
Maybe I'll remember.

15:23.179 --> 15:27.159
I'm afraid this isn't the
ideal situation for me.

15:27.183 --> 15:29.161
Yes, it is. Sure it is.

15:29.185 --> 15:31.956
We're an incredible family, and you
get weekends and holidays off...

15:31.980 --> 15:34.417
And I'll go to the
library tonight,

15:34.441 --> 15:36.711
and I will read the, um, Pia...

15:36.735 --> 15:41.914
There's an odor... coming
from your kitchen.

16:04.012 --> 16:05.605
It's hot in here!

16:06.139 --> 16:08.066
Yeah, I like this song, too!

16:08.558 --> 16:10.077
Want something to drink?

16:10.101 --> 16:11.245
What?

16:11.269 --> 16:12.487
I'm sorry!

16:12.645 --> 16:14.123
Like a beer or something!

16:14.147 --> 16:15.323
Whatever!

16:24.032 --> 16:25.208
Julia!

16:26.785 --> 16:27.960
Julia!

16:29.954 --> 16:31.140
Charlie, hey!

16:31.164 --> 16:32.433
What are you doing in here?
You should...

16:32.457 --> 16:33.559
A date!

16:33.583 --> 16:35.676
I'm on a date! How about you?

16:35.752 --> 16:37.062
How'd you get in here?

16:37.086 --> 16:39.013
The guy I'm with
knows the bouncer!

16:39.214 --> 16:40.389
Which one is he?

16:40.757 --> 16:44.519
Uh, dark hair, striped
shirt, over by the bar!

16:45.261 --> 16:46.854
This guy drive you?

16:46.930 --> 16:48.240
What are you? My big brother?

16:48.264 --> 16:50.691
We took a bus! Hey, Dougie!

16:50.725 --> 16:52.693
Hey, Jules. Cool coat.

16:53.019 --> 16:54.580
Julia, I really don't
think you should be in...

16:54.604 --> 16:57.365
I know, I know, but I
love you anyway. Later.

16:59.359 --> 17:00.993
Hey, we gotta talk, man.

17:06.532 --> 17:08.084
You know those two guys?

17:08.367 --> 17:11.045
Maybe I do. Why? You jealous?

17:12.704 --> 17:15.340
The guy in the jean jacket's my
brother, and the other guy...

17:17.252 --> 17:19.679
We kind of went out for a
while over the summer.

17:19.878 --> 17:21.180
No kidding.

17:22.464 --> 17:24.099
So, is that about you?

17:24.300 --> 17:25.611
I don't know what happened!

17:25.635 --> 17:27.019
Son of a bitch!

17:27.762 --> 17:28.823
I don't know.

17:28.847 --> 17:31.566
Uh... That's just my brother.

17:32.475 --> 17:34.110
Look, you want to
get out of here?

17:39.274 --> 17:40.867
These your folks?

17:41.234 --> 17:42.493
Yeah.

17:43.194 --> 17:45.663
She's pretty, your mom.

17:47.407 --> 17:48.916
You want to kiss me?

17:52.161 --> 17:53.379
Sure.

17:53.746 --> 17:55.256
Sure, I want to.

18:02.839 --> 18:04.932
You got any music or anything?

18:05.884 --> 18:08.394
Well, I didn't move
my stereo in yet,

18:08.553 --> 18:10.146
but there's a radio.

18:11.598 --> 18:13.232
Don't worry about it.
Doesn't matter.

18:33.161 --> 18:34.837
What? What'd I do?

18:35.079 --> 18:36.432
Nothing. You just...

18:36.456 --> 18:37.632
What?

18:38.207 --> 18:39.393
Surprised me, that's all.

18:39.417 --> 18:40.593
Oh.

18:42.086 --> 18:43.262
Oh.

18:52.472 --> 18:53.365
Julia!

18:53.389 --> 18:54.783
She's kinda busy. I
wouldn't interrupt.

18:54.807 --> 18:56.484
Julia, would you get down here?

18:56.851 --> 18:58.152
Julia!

18:59.520 --> 19:01.165
What the hell are you
screaming about?

19:01.189 --> 19:03.574
Family conference. Now.

19:05.485 --> 19:06.953
I'm sorry about this.

19:11.616 --> 19:14.085
Golden Gate bridge...
Three a.m.?

19:14.702 --> 19:17.129
Not tonight. See you tomorrow?

19:17.622 --> 19:18.599
Sure.

19:18.623 --> 19:19.840
Okay.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.638
This better be so good.

19:26.547 --> 19:27.765
We, uh...

19:28.007 --> 19:30.601
We got a problem we gotta
talk about, and, uh...

19:32.637 --> 19:34.031
It'll work out.
I'll work it out.

19:34.055 --> 19:36.399
For God's sakes, Charlie. You
already screwed up my night.

19:36.432 --> 19:37.618
Are you gonna tell
us what's going on,

19:37.642 --> 19:39.068
or are we just gonna stand here?

19:40.728 --> 19:43.499
Me and Doug and a friend of his

19:43.523 --> 19:46.409
were gonna buy this co-op
and fix it up and sell it.

19:46.567 --> 19:48.128
The whole thing was gonna
take a month, tops,

19:48.152 --> 19:50.496
and we would've doubled
our money, no question...

19:51.656 --> 19:53.249
Except for the guy...

19:54.033 --> 19:55.835
...took the money and split.

19:59.288 --> 20:01.340
How much money did
you lose, Charlie?

20:08.339 --> 20:09.640
Twelve...

20:12.927 --> 20:14.103
...thousand.

20:16.431 --> 20:18.107
Of your own money, right?

20:23.021 --> 20:25.781
So much for your lectures
on responsibility, huh?

20:26.107 --> 20:27.626
Is this why you wanted
control of the account?

20:27.650 --> 20:29.044
So you could blow
it all yourself?

20:29.068 --> 20:31.130
Hey, I was trying to do
something good here.

20:31.154 --> 20:32.381
This investment was
for all of us!

20:32.405 --> 20:34.040
Well, save it, Charlie.

20:35.616 --> 20:39.337
So, what are we gonna do for the next
four months until we get another check?

20:42.582 --> 20:44.216
How much do we have left?

20:44.625 --> 20:46.677
Well, we got 2,500 yesterday.

20:47.628 --> 20:48.804
That's it.

20:48.963 --> 20:50.306
That's it?

20:50.465 --> 20:53.235
We have to hire a nanny and fix
the sink and pay the phone bill.

20:53.259 --> 20:54.862
Plus we've got a mortgage
payment due this Friday.

20:54.886 --> 20:56.437
There's no way we're
gonna meet that.

20:57.013 --> 21:00.784
Okay. So tomorrow we go to Mr. Graham.
We ask him for an advance.

21:00.808 --> 21:01.744
No.

21:01.768 --> 21:03.162
Why not? It's an emergency.

21:03.186 --> 21:05.154
Because we gotta seem in charge.

21:05.605 --> 21:08.000
We've gotta seem like we can
handle everything ourselves,

21:08.024 --> 21:11.369
like a normal family, or else they
have an excuse to split us up.

21:12.987 --> 21:14.622
Great, Charlie.

21:15.490 --> 21:18.626
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

21:27.168 --> 21:28.677
So I guess...

21:30.088 --> 21:32.890
We give up whatever
we have to give up.

21:35.218 --> 21:37.603
We'll let everyone think
you're this great guy

21:38.179 --> 21:40.481
who's trying to hold
his family together...

21:40.765 --> 21:42.858
You're just like a
father to us...

21:43.768 --> 21:45.569
...even if we know it's a lie.

21:51.317 --> 21:52.576
Claudia?

21:53.236 --> 21:54.829
What's the matter, Claud?

21:56.531 --> 21:57.957
I'm scared.

21:58.908 --> 22:00.084
Don't be.

22:00.618 --> 22:02.044
We'll work it out.

22:04.497 --> 22:07.550
This wouldn't have happened
if Mom and Dad were here.

22:10.628 --> 22:12.388
Why aren't they here?

22:16.134 --> 22:17.601
Come here.

22:19.345 --> 22:20.813
We're gonna be okay.

22:21.722 --> 22:23.941
I promise you, we're
gonna be okay.

22:50.209 --> 22:52.636
What? Another announcement?

22:53.421 --> 22:56.140
What'd you do this time, lose
the house in a poker game?

22:56.799 --> 22:58.434
Look, I know I screwed up.

22:59.927 --> 23:01.312
So, uh...

23:01.846 --> 23:04.106
I'm gonna do what I should
have been doing all along.

23:04.932 --> 23:07.244
I'm gonna spend a
lot more time here,

23:07.268 --> 23:09.320
I'm gonna take more
responsibility...

23:11.772 --> 23:13.449
I'm gonna look after you guys.

23:17.987 --> 23:19.914
At least someone's
happy about it.

23:20.823 --> 23:23.760
Oh, and, Julia, you gotta clear your
stuff out of Mom and Dad's room,

23:23.784 --> 23:25.971
and you'd better put my stuff
back where you found it.

23:25.995 --> 23:27.097
What?

23:27.121 --> 23:29.882
If I'm gonna be spending all this time
here, I'm not sleeping on the sofa.

23:29.916 --> 23:30.893
What gives you the right?

23:30.917 --> 23:34.345
I'm 24 years old. I'm the only adult here.
End of story.

23:35.546 --> 23:37.890
Either you move your stuff
out or I throw it out.

23:42.929 --> 23:44.573
Ow! That's my thumb!

23:44.597 --> 23:45.657
Sorry.

23:45.681 --> 23:47.534
No, Claud, Claud,
don't let that go!

23:47.558 --> 23:49.036
Don't yell at me. I'm trying.

23:49.060 --> 23:51.246
I know. Okay. Just
pull the string back.

23:51.270 --> 23:53.206
Okay. I'm pulling. I'm pulling!

23:53.230 --> 23:55.574
And I'll snap this.
There we are.

24:04.116 --> 24:05.552
Pretty neat, huh?

24:05.576 --> 24:07.670
Yeah, not too shabby.

24:07.703 --> 24:09.848
Now all I have to do is
move my sleeping bag in,

24:09.872 --> 24:11.433
and one side can be my bedroom,

24:11.457 --> 24:13.300
and the other'll
be my living area.

24:14.043 --> 24:16.345
I might even invite you
over for dinner one night.

24:18.506 --> 24:20.901
Just a perfect love,
yes, you are.

24:20.925 --> 24:22.518
Absolutely. A love.

24:23.844 --> 24:25.479
Is your dog ill?

24:25.930 --> 24:27.898
Uh, moody.

24:28.516 --> 24:31.370
Claudia, Charlie, this is Mrs.
Pick.

24:31.394 --> 24:32.287
Hi.

24:32.311 --> 24:33.654
How's it going?

24:33.896 --> 24:36.282
I see your family's going
on a camping trip?

24:36.315 --> 24:40.212
Uh, no. We kind of
got a space problem,

24:40.236 --> 24:41.870
my sister and me.

24:44.073 --> 24:45.801
This is gonna be her
room from now on.

24:45.825 --> 24:48.627
We believe in creative
solutions around here.

24:50.413 --> 24:51.714
Right.

24:52.206 --> 24:55.009
We don't use the dining
room much anyway, so...

24:55.751 --> 24:57.094
You know what?

24:57.586 --> 25:01.557
I believe I neglected to leave
my emergency parking brake on.

25:03.884 --> 25:06.520
It's okay. I can see myself out.

25:06.554 --> 25:07.771
Oh!

25:09.181 --> 25:10.399
Okay.

25:13.394 --> 25:14.611
She's history, right?

25:15.354 --> 25:16.613
Ancient.

25:22.236 --> 25:23.620
Hey, P.K.

25:28.284 --> 25:30.345
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:30.369 --> 25:31.471
We're just heading out.

25:31.495 --> 25:33.297
Oh, yeah? Where you going?

25:33.706 --> 25:34.725
Berkeley.

25:34.749 --> 25:36.216
Cool. Can I come?

25:37.126 --> 25:38.645
Actually, we're gonna
be camping out

25:38.669 --> 25:40.313
for some Pyro tickets
at the Greek, so...

25:40.337 --> 25:41.648
Oh, sure.

25:41.672 --> 25:44.224
Maybe we can get together
tomorrow or something.

25:45.634 --> 25:47.353
Uh, tomorrow...

25:48.179 --> 25:49.781
You know, day after today?

25:49.805 --> 25:51.607
We could see a movie,
get something to eat.

25:53.059 --> 25:55.152
I can't. I'm busy.

25:57.063 --> 25:59.156
Well, you'll call
me later, right?

26:02.818 --> 26:05.037
Look, just so you understand,

26:06.030 --> 26:07.873
we're not going out or anything.

26:10.242 --> 26:11.502
What?

26:13.454 --> 26:15.089
Well, I mean,

26:15.206 --> 26:18.008
the other night was fun
and everything, but...

26:19.085 --> 26:21.595
Well, I don't want you
hanging around all the time.

26:22.713 --> 26:24.932
You know, like we're
together or something.

26:27.051 --> 26:29.144
I just thought that...

26:29.762 --> 26:32.106
Look, I... I've gotta go.

26:34.683 --> 26:35.943
Yeah.

27:20.563 --> 27:21.738
Okay.

27:25.067 --> 27:26.128
Shh.

27:26.152 --> 27:27.536
Shh.

27:28.571 --> 27:31.832
Listen, just to keep
you up to date,

27:31.866 --> 27:33.876
and don't take this
the wrong way,

27:34.285 --> 27:36.086
but I'm going crazy here.

27:37.454 --> 27:40.048
So unless I come up with
some kind of nanny soon,

27:41.417 --> 27:43.478
I'm gonna have to sell you
off to white slave traders.

27:43.502 --> 27:47.347
Now, I know that's not how you
pictured yourself growing up,

27:47.965 --> 27:51.351
but, hey, welcome to the club.

27:59.518 --> 28:00.777
Sleep well.

28:13.616 --> 28:16.887
Okay, I'm supposed to
come up with three ways

28:16.911 --> 28:21.423
our lives have been made better by
the continuing exploration of space.

28:23.709 --> 28:24.885
Three ways.

28:29.256 --> 28:32.027
How about satellites,
you know, like...

28:32.051 --> 28:33.028
TV satellites?

28:33.052 --> 28:34.269
Okay.

28:35.179 --> 28:36.907
You want to pitch
in here, Charlie?

28:36.931 --> 28:39.817
Huh? Uh...

28:40.351 --> 28:42.069
I don't know, better planes?

28:42.728 --> 28:44.071
That's only two.

28:45.648 --> 28:47.115
Um...

28:49.193 --> 28:50.170
Tang.

28:50.194 --> 28:51.588
- Yeah!
- I love Tang.

28:51.612 --> 28:53.080
It's the best, man.

28:53.322 --> 28:54.382
Where you been?

28:54.406 --> 28:58.544
Out. With that guy, P.K.

28:58.786 --> 29:01.515
That didn't take long. You've
only been gone an hour.

29:01.539 --> 29:02.881
What, did he break up with you?

29:09.922 --> 29:11.525
Well, I think you're better off.

29:11.549 --> 29:13.016
Definitely.

29:13.092 --> 29:14.643
You're not surprised, are you?

29:15.302 --> 29:16.238
Well, I just...

29:16.262 --> 29:17.447
Forget it.

29:17.471 --> 29:19.314
You're too good for
that guy anyway.

29:20.766 --> 29:23.485
What happened to our rule, no
going out on school nights?

29:25.563 --> 29:26.989
Go to hell, Charlie.

29:38.909 --> 29:40.512
Lights-out time,
Claudia, come on.

29:40.536 --> 29:44.464
No way. I never go to bed this early.
Bailey?

29:44.873 --> 29:45.976
Starting tonight.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.687
Forget it. You can't
tell me what to do.

29:48.711 --> 29:50.981
Oh, yes, I can. Read the
guardianship agreement.

29:51.005 --> 29:52.983
Would you shut up with
that already, Charlie?

29:53.007 --> 29:55.601
A piece of paper does
not make you a parent.

30:02.558 --> 30:06.194
Hey, you know what? I am really sick
of hearing that from you, Bailey.

30:06.520 --> 30:09.990
If you've got a problem with this agreement,
fine! It doesn't have to be this way.

30:10.649 --> 30:12.618
You guys just won't be
able to stay together.

30:12.776 --> 30:16.204
No one will be in charge, and they'll
come in here and split you guys up.

30:17.906 --> 30:21.761
I'm responsible for this family, and I'm
gonna take that responsibility seriously.

30:21.785 --> 30:25.140
Oh, give me a break, Charlie! You're
the one who lost the money, not me!

30:25.164 --> 30:26.224
You want to help us?

30:26.248 --> 30:28.935
We don't need your rules, okay?
Why don't you go get a job!

30:28.959 --> 30:30.020
I am getting a job!

30:30.044 --> 30:31.187
What?

30:31.211 --> 30:33.388
I got carpentry
stuff in the wings.

30:33.464 --> 30:36.067
You know, you've always got
something in the wings, Charlie.

30:36.091 --> 30:38.153
I saw the jobs you
circled in the paper...

30:38.177 --> 30:40.905
Construction foreman,
master carpenter...

30:40.929 --> 30:45.233
You're not looking for a job. You're
looking for a career. We need money now.

30:45.517 --> 30:47.444
If you want to help
us, go get a job.

31:01.116 --> 31:03.168
It's late, Claud. You
should get ready for bed.

31:24.932 --> 31:27.025
Hey, Jule, can I come
in for a second?

31:33.482 --> 31:34.825
Are you okay?

31:35.609 --> 31:37.494
Fine, never better.

31:38.737 --> 31:40.247
What does it look like?

31:45.661 --> 31:47.254
Well, what's going on with you?

31:47.287 --> 31:49.381
Is this about that jerk, P.K.?

31:50.708 --> 31:53.301
Is that supposed to make me feel
better, calling him a jerk?

31:53.877 --> 31:56.555
No. I didn't mean to...

31:57.339 --> 31:58.598
I'm sorry.

32:00.759 --> 32:02.644
Look, what do you
want me to say?

32:03.804 --> 32:05.147
I don't know.

32:06.807 --> 32:07.983
Something.

32:08.225 --> 32:11.069
I want you to say something
to make me feel better.

32:22.448 --> 32:25.542
This, this guy made a gun
rack in shop class, Jule.

32:25.951 --> 32:27.878
I mean, he's not for you.

32:29.580 --> 32:32.174
That's really the best
you can do, isn't it?

32:34.418 --> 32:37.929
I really liked this guy,
and he dumped me, Bailey.

32:39.131 --> 32:40.984
And you don't know what to say,

32:41.008 --> 32:42.559
because you don't
know how that feels.

32:43.218 --> 32:45.071
And you can't tell me
that it's gonna be okay,

32:45.095 --> 32:46.688
because you don't
know that it is.

32:50.017 --> 32:51.610
God, there's no one.

32:52.603 --> 32:55.489
You know? There's no one
to tell me what to do.

33:00.319 --> 33:01.620
Please, Bailey...

33:02.988 --> 33:06.792
Please just go away, okay?

33:12.539 --> 33:13.924
What do you mean, you pawned it?

33:14.082 --> 33:15.467
I had no choice.

33:15.834 --> 33:19.387
The lessons are real expensive, and
we're kind of strapped right now.

33:19.713 --> 33:21.765
Owen has no one to
take care of him.

33:22.716 --> 33:24.736
I guess I had to choose
between my violin

33:24.760 --> 33:26.812
and a nanny for my baby brother.

33:28.722 --> 33:30.065
I'm sorry, Ross.

33:32.059 --> 33:33.360
I'm sorry.

33:36.939 --> 33:38.865
Well, I tell you
what we have to do.

33:39.149 --> 33:41.535
I have to take you on as
a scholarship student.

33:42.361 --> 33:44.297
No charge until you get unstuck.

33:44.321 --> 33:47.467
No. You... you can't
afford to do that.

33:47.491 --> 33:50.178
Of course I can. I don't want
you stopping your lessons.

33:50.202 --> 33:51.763
Not now. You're right
on the verge of...

33:51.787 --> 33:53.338
Please, don't make me do this.

33:58.418 --> 34:00.345
Well, I would never do that.

34:01.797 --> 34:04.808
If it's something you really don't
want to do, then you should stop.

34:09.054 --> 34:11.022
But, Claudia, listen to me.

34:12.891 --> 34:15.652
You have something so rare.

34:15.893 --> 34:18.029
You have it. Your mom had it.

34:18.772 --> 34:20.699
That makes it even more special.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.203
But it's a big drag sometimes.

34:26.196 --> 34:28.206
I can't be in the play.

34:29.366 --> 34:31.877
I can't do anything
every other kid does.

34:33.579 --> 34:34.795
You know what?

34:35.998 --> 34:38.675
Instead of thinking about
what you're missing,

34:39.293 --> 34:42.387
try thinking about what you have
that everyone else is missing.

34:44.089 --> 34:46.308
When you pick up a violin,

34:46.466 --> 34:50.020
you can make something so
beautiful whenever you want.

34:52.222 --> 34:54.065
Do you know how lucky you are?

34:56.101 --> 34:57.569
Not really.

35:00.063 --> 35:02.866
Trust me. The luckiest.

35:08.864 --> 35:10.957
Is this the Salinger residence?

35:11.158 --> 35:13.501
I'm here to interview
for the nanny position.

35:15.412 --> 35:16.922
Kirsten Bennett.

35:17.831 --> 35:21.009
I'm Bailey. He's Owen.

35:22.336 --> 35:23.970
Uh, won't you come in?

35:24.963 --> 35:26.431
He's adorable.

35:28.133 --> 35:29.392
Uh-huh.

35:32.095 --> 35:35.065
So, is there anything
you'd like to ask me?

35:37.434 --> 35:39.527
Did you have any
trouble getting here?

36:45.794 --> 36:46.970
Bravo!

36:47.921 --> 36:49.139
Wonderful!

36:49.548 --> 36:50.724
Bravo!

37:00.308 --> 37:01.526
Who's that?

37:02.519 --> 37:03.746
That's Kirsten.

37:03.770 --> 37:06.114
Uh-huh. Kirsten what?

37:06.481 --> 37:08.626
Okay. What are her
qualifications?

37:08.650 --> 37:09.961
She's a nanny.

37:09.985 --> 37:11.170
What's her criminal record?

37:11.194 --> 37:13.913
She doesn't have one...
I don't think.

37:14.072 --> 37:15.957
Bailey, what's your problem?

37:16.575 --> 37:19.303
How can you turn Owen
over to a total stranger?

37:19.327 --> 37:20.596
I mean, I know you're
desperate, but...

37:20.620 --> 37:21.963
Hello!

37:23.123 --> 37:24.674
You must be Claudia.

37:26.668 --> 37:27.687
What?

37:27.711 --> 37:31.389
Listen, Owen was a dream,
and the Jeep runs great.

37:31.590 --> 37:33.609
You sure you don't mind me driving
it to school every night?

37:33.633 --> 37:36.019
It's yours. That's the deal.

37:37.304 --> 37:40.648
Well, somebody needs
his diaper changed.

37:44.770 --> 37:46.247
Now I remember.

37:46.271 --> 37:48.666
She's in grad school.
Child psychology.

37:48.690 --> 37:52.577
Two years teaching preschool plus three
nanny jobs with recommendations.

37:53.403 --> 37:54.672
You gave her the Jeep?

37:54.696 --> 37:56.539
Plus $75 less a week.

37:56.698 --> 37:57.884
Two birds with one stone.

37:57.908 --> 37:59.626
Plus I get driving privileges.

37:59.785 --> 38:01.169
Pretty smart, huh?

38:02.245 --> 38:03.671
Major poop.

38:03.705 --> 38:05.391
You'd better keep that
away from Bailey.

38:05.415 --> 38:06.309
He never likes...

38:06.333 --> 38:07.435
Let me help you with that.

38:07.459 --> 38:09.719
- You don't mind?
- Of course not.

38:11.505 --> 38:12.931
I, uh...

38:13.423 --> 38:15.266
I need to ask a favor, Joe.

38:18.595 --> 38:20.105
How much we talking about?

38:22.516 --> 38:23.650
A couple thou.

38:25.227 --> 38:28.780
Actually, 3,000
would help a lot.

38:29.272 --> 38:32.335
I wouldn't ask if we weren't in
kind of a tight spot right now,

38:32.359 --> 38:34.253
and I'll pay you
back, Joe, I swear.

38:34.277 --> 38:36.172
I'm waiting for a job to
come through right now,

38:36.196 --> 38:37.956
and as soon as it does...

38:40.033 --> 38:42.419
Or you could have it in trade.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.639
You've been talking about
having this bar refinished.

38:44.663 --> 38:45.964
I could do that for you.

38:47.624 --> 38:49.926
Actually, I kind of
like it the way it is.

38:51.211 --> 38:52.512
It's got character.

38:55.590 --> 38:57.142
Three thou, huh?

39:00.637 --> 39:02.063
Okay. You got it.

39:02.097 --> 39:03.356
Really?

39:03.932 --> 39:06.160
God, thanks, man. That's great.

39:06.184 --> 39:07.787
I really appreciate it.

39:07.811 --> 39:10.873
And I'll just take a little chunk
out of your paycheck every week.

39:10.897 --> 39:13.616
Yeah. Once I get a
paycheck, right?

39:14.109 --> 39:15.169
You got one.

39:15.193 --> 39:17.495
Quick, how do you make
a Singapore Sling?

39:19.990 --> 39:21.666
You want me to bartend here?

39:22.242 --> 39:25.503
Come on, Joe. I said I'd find a way
to pay you back, and I meant it.

39:28.623 --> 39:29.799
What?

39:30.500 --> 39:31.936
It's like deja vu.

39:31.960 --> 39:34.105
You know how many times back
when your dad owned this place

39:34.129 --> 39:37.474
I saw you stand in that
spot and say exactly that?

39:38.175 --> 39:40.226
What, you're gonna
call me a flake too?

39:41.928 --> 39:44.230
He and I never had a fight
where he didn't call me that.

39:45.390 --> 39:46.900
Listen, Charlie,

39:47.350 --> 39:49.328
if you need the
money, it's yours,

39:49.352 --> 39:51.112
but you're gonna
have to work for it.

39:51.354 --> 39:55.950
I'm willing to give you a
job, but not a handout.

40:00.655 --> 40:02.758
It's O.J., shot of gin,

40:02.782 --> 40:05.710
splash of sweet and sour,
and a cherry brandy float.

40:29.893 --> 40:32.362
I had a thing for
Gina Lewin last year.

40:34.314 --> 40:37.242
I didn't really talk
about it much, but...

40:37.776 --> 40:39.410
I was nuts about her.

40:40.946 --> 40:42.747
So I kept asking her out,

40:43.448 --> 40:46.000
until finally she just
told me to buzz off.

40:46.993 --> 40:50.338
She wasn't really mean about it or
anything, but still, you know...

40:51.498 --> 40:53.216
I was in pretty bad shape.

40:55.293 --> 40:56.678
What did you do?

40:58.964 --> 41:00.848
Actually, I think I went to Dad.

41:02.592 --> 41:04.435
Yeah. I did.

41:06.137 --> 41:07.522
And he told me...

41:09.432 --> 41:10.608
What?

41:14.562 --> 41:15.989
I don't remember.

41:17.315 --> 41:20.002
It was something... It
was something great,

41:20.026 --> 41:21.953
something that
made it hurt less.

41:25.198 --> 41:26.916
I don't remember. I'm sorry.

41:27.450 --> 41:28.928
Yeah. Well...

41:28.952 --> 41:30.628
Hey, I'm trying.

41:31.621 --> 41:34.632
You know, I don't have anybody
to tell me what to do either.

41:35.083 --> 41:37.594
I'm just feeling my way
through, the same as you.

41:43.049 --> 41:45.184
Do you ever think
about them, Bailey?

41:48.555 --> 41:50.857
Yeah. Of course I do.

41:53.310 --> 41:55.445
Well, why don't we
ever talk about them?

41:56.229 --> 41:58.239
I mean, why don't we
ever talk about it?

41:59.524 --> 42:00.783
I don't know.

42:02.569 --> 42:04.454
Maybe we feel like we have to...

42:05.030 --> 42:08.499
...put on this brave face for Claud
and Owen, but maybe that's stupid.

42:08.783 --> 42:11.336
Maybe we should talk about them.
Maybe it would help.

42:14.039 --> 42:16.674
Sometimes I wonder if this
feeling's ever gonna go away.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.178
I don't know.

42:21.671 --> 42:23.556
I hope so, but I don't know.

42:28.511 --> 42:32.273
Julia, I figure there is
so much that I don't know,

42:32.891 --> 42:34.442
that all I can do...

42:35.935 --> 42:38.446
...is grab onto the
stuff that I'm sure of,

42:39.022 --> 42:40.499
you know, like the five of us.

42:40.523 --> 42:45.036
The five of us have to stay together as long
as we can. It just feels right, doesn't it?

42:46.154 --> 42:47.757
It's the same thing
with this dinner thing.

42:47.781 --> 42:51.668
It's just... I know we
have to keep that going.

42:52.452 --> 42:53.628
Why?

42:54.871 --> 42:56.255
Because it matters.

42:57.415 --> 43:00.718
It matters to me. It
matters to the others.

43:03.296 --> 43:05.598
And I know it would have
mattered to Mom and Dad.

43:24.067 --> 43:27.870
God, look at him. He looks more
and more like your dad every day.

43:28.071 --> 43:30.091
He's so cute. Let me
show him off, please?

43:30.115 --> 43:32.301
Okay. Bring him back, though, Janet.
We're kind of attached to him.

43:32.325 --> 43:33.584
Hey, you guys.

43:34.369 --> 43:35.586
Hey, Charlie.

43:35.745 --> 43:36.722
What's with the, uh...

43:36.746 --> 43:38.557
Are you planning on
ordering lobster?

43:38.581 --> 43:40.675
It's a bib, Claudia,
not an apron.

43:41.167 --> 43:44.220
No, I'm, uh, I'm working here.
Joe gave me a job tending bar.

43:44.629 --> 43:45.606
No kidding?

43:45.630 --> 43:46.607
No kidding.

43:46.631 --> 43:48.692
Hey, Charlie, you
slacking off already?

43:48.716 --> 43:49.610
I'm taking ten, Joe.

43:49.634 --> 43:51.320
How about showing your best
customers to their booth?

43:51.344 --> 43:52.812
Salinger, party of five.

43:52.971 --> 43:54.156
Julia flake again?

43:54.180 --> 43:55.950
It's a tough time.
Give her a while.

43:55.974 --> 43:57.493
She ought to be here.

43:57.517 --> 43:59.736
If you guys ever
need a babysitter...

44:00.562 --> 44:02.039
So, what can I get you to drink?

44:02.063 --> 44:03.698
- The usual.
- The usual.

44:05.400 --> 44:08.327
So, what about building
houses, Charlie?

44:09.028 --> 44:11.966
Just figure me for
$550 a week with tips.

44:11.990 --> 44:13.717
Twenty five from dog walking.

44:13.741 --> 44:15.877
I should make 50
at the shoe store.

44:16.327 --> 44:18.264
Joe spotted me a couple thou.
I, uh...

44:18.288 --> 44:20.423
I sent the mortgage payment
off this afternoon.

44:21.207 --> 44:23.843
How about that? We
just might manage.

44:24.169 --> 44:25.762
So, what's everyone having?

44:27.380 --> 44:28.931
Shove over, Char.

44:30.175 --> 44:31.726
Glad you made it.

44:31.885 --> 44:34.071
Too bad Kirsten couldn't
come tonight, huh, Bay?

44:34.095 --> 44:35.698
Kirsten? Who's Kirsten?

44:35.722 --> 44:37.575
- She's our new nanny.
- Oh, yeah?

44:37.599 --> 44:39.493
- Where's the sourdough?
- He's got it.

44:39.517 --> 44:40.619
So you finally hired someone?

44:40.643 --> 44:41.745
Yeah. We have a new nanny.

44:41.769 --> 44:43.414
I want the sourdough.
You always get it.

44:43.438 --> 44:44.781
Fine. It's yours.

44:45.356 --> 44:47.742
Ew, gross. You took
a bite out of it.

44:48.193 --> 44:49.420
So, what's this Kirsten like?

44:49.444 --> 44:51.630
She's... she's very professional.

44:51.654 --> 44:53.039
Very highly qualified.

44:53.114 --> 44:54.874
And a real looker, huh?

44:55.305 --> 45:01.234
