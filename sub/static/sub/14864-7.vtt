WEBVTT

03:01.932 --> 03:07.097
Perhaps if we retreat to the coast via Thessaly,
we could hold out until the rains come.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.642
If we go eastward,
they'll be able to out us off here.

03:10.775 --> 03:12.356
Of course.

03:12.485 --> 03:15.067
It will not do.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.482
Ready.

03:19.909 --> 03:25.154
Maps never redraw themselves,
if that's what you're waiting for.

03:25.289 --> 03:29.498
He's right. We shall just have to fight
the wretches here where we stand.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.208
And beat them.

03:31.337 --> 03:34.625
We shall crush them, doubtless.

03:35.633 --> 03:39.125
Dinner for worms, the whole damn lot of 'em.

03:39.261 --> 03:41.297
Dinner for worms.

03:57.655 --> 04:00.317
Try to avoid bloodshed this time.

04:00.449 --> 04:04.158
Wait a while
and Pompey can shave you instead.

04:04.286 --> 04:08.120
Torquatus should have something, no?
A praetorship perhaps.

04:08.249 --> 04:13.164
If Torquatus is given high office, Varro must
be given the same, else we'll see trouble.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.581
But then what do we give Labienus?

04:15.714 --> 04:19.252
- Macedonia?
— Bithynia. Macedonia to Libo.

04:19.385 --> 04:22.252
Plums for your people
and porridge for the rest, eh?

04:22.388 --> 04:27.052
Macedonia and Bithynia
are not yet ours to bestow.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.846
You are cooking rabbits
that have not been caught.

04:29.979 --> 04:35.770
Our particular rabbit is cornered,
starving and has lost near 2,000 men.

04:36.902 --> 04:40.941
I think we may safely say
that here is a rabbit ready for the pot.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.984
— Why so melancholy, Brutus?
— Do I seem so?

04:46.120 --> 04:47.985
Forgive me.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.205
No, Caesar's defeat is a glory.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.996
We cannot endure tyrants
but I cannot celebrate it.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.583
He was as my father to me.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.924
| feel for you. When do we strike?

05:02.052 --> 05:03.792
Strike? We've already struck.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.920
We have him down but he's not dead yet.

05:06.056 --> 05:09.423
— When do we strike the final blow?
- There will not be one.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.723
If we simply keep him bottled up
a month or so more,

05:12.855 --> 05:16.768
the remains of his army
will disintegrate and disappear.

05:16.901 --> 05:19.267
- At no cost to us.
— Is that honourable?

05:19.403 --> 05:24.648
Caesar has driven us from Rome,
chased us out of Italy, killed our friends,

05:24.783 --> 05:26.614
usurped our Republic.

05:26.744 --> 05:29.611
Surely, dignity and honour demands
we walk in his blood.

05:29.747 --> 05:33.706
— Certainly, knee deep.
— You would have hunger do our work for us!

05:33.834 --> 05:38.419
We must attack Caesar and kill him under
the eyes of Mars, else our victory is empty.

05:38.547 --> 05:42.460
He has sense.
It will look better at home if we win by force.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.629
You are Pompey Magnus.

05:44.762 --> 05:49.051
You conquer and crush your enemies
as if they were insects.

05:49.183 --> 05:52.471
People will be disappointed by anything less.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.187
News from Greece!

05:57.316 --> 06:00.729
Mark Antony is safe
but most of the ships in his fleet,

06:00.861 --> 06:05.821
sent in aid of Gaius Julius Caesar,
have been lost at sea.

06:05.950 --> 06:10.910
Caesar is now surrounded
and severely outnumbered.

06:11.038 --> 06:15.782
The forces of the Republic and Senate
and of Pompey Magnus confidently expect

06:15.918 --> 06:19.456
a decisive victory to follow shortly.

06:24.802 --> 06:27.009
— There you are.
— Here I am.

06:27.137 --> 06:31.676
| ask Timon for protection and he sends me
a bunch of halfwits and clowns!

06:31.809 --> 06:32.844
Dear me.

06:32.977 --> 06:36.185
Caesar will soon be dead
and we shall be undefended.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.850
We may as well be lying naked in the street!

06:38.983 --> 06:43.568
You must go to Servilia and ask for
a few of her men to stand outside for us.

06:43.696 --> 06:45.106
Why?

06:45.239 --> 06:49.778
— So they can guard our doors in her name.
- I mean, why must I go?

06:49.910 --> 06:51.696
As if I would go begging to Servilia.

06:51.829 --> 06:54.366
- I think not.
— I'll not go begging for you.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.706
— Don't be childish. It's not as if she'll refuse.
— You think?

06:57.835 --> 07:01.794
Why would she? Those lovely gifts I gave her?

07:04.008 --> 07:06.670
— What did she say?
- Nothing.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.384
- Nothing.
— She said something.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.469
She said nothing.

07:11.599 --> 07:17.139
You're very arrogant. Think you can buy
her friendship with stud slaves and tortoises?

07:17.271 --> 07:20.729
— And six barrels of ice.
— I'd rather not go.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.689
You'd rather not go.

07:22.818 --> 07:26.310
You'd rather be gang—raped by proles
while the house burns down.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.688
Frankly, I'm past caring.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.611
One day Caesar is winning
and you crow happily,

07:31.744 --> 07:35.236
next day he is losing and I must go a—begging?

07:35.372 --> 07:38.614
| just want this vile war to be over,
one way or the other.

07:38.751 --> 07:42.664
Octavia, it is over.
That is why you must go to Servilia's house.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.708
It's a bore, I know. There we are.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.900
Lyde.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.069
Very nice.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.822
Don't.

08:15.913 --> 08:19.906
I'm glad to see you.
I've been worried about you.

08:21.210 --> 08:25.078
No need. I'm doing very well.

08:25.214 --> 08:27.421
Not as well as you, obviously.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.088
Do you need money?

08:32.888 --> 08:34.879
I've got money if you need some.

08:35.015 --> 08:39.304
I'm sure you have.
Turns out your man backed the right horse.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.813
Fortune loves you.

08:47.069 --> 08:49.811
I don't know if Vorenus is alive or dead.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.659
I'm sorry.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.080
I'm sorry.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.621
I didn't want to be like this.

09:05.713 --> 09:09.831
I'm so tired, Niobe.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.508
I'm tired of being angry.

09:14.513 --> 09:18.301
I'm tired of hating you.

09:24.148 --> 09:26.139
You're all I've got.

09:32.948 --> 09:35.030
I'm sorry.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.454
Do you want some honey water?

10:12.196 --> 10:14.437
You're wasting your time!

10:14.573 --> 10:17.861
We'll die of thirst long before we die of hunger.

10:25.334 --> 10:28.952
— We could drink their blood.
- Repeat?

10:29.087 --> 10:32.375
All these dead men, we could drink their blood.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.089
Too salty.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.380
Only make you more thirsty.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.720
Putrid by now anyway.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.472
Doesn't matter.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.687
Everything will be fine.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.399
This is where we die.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.611
What are you writing?

10:56.740 --> 10:58.856
A message to Niobe.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.569
All right. Good idea.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.909
Send my best to Eirene,
will you, while you're at it?

11:07.960 --> 11:10.042
If there's space.

11:21.557 --> 11:24.344
Graces, don't we look lovely?

11:24.476 --> 11:26.853
If I'm to be a beggar, I will not look like one.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.640
I am not objecting, my honey,

11:28.772 --> 11:32.481
though you will remind Servilia
of what an old trout she's become.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.316
I'm just happy to see you
looking so pretty for once.

11:35.445 --> 11:38.733
You do so often insist on playing the frump.

11:53.297 --> 11:56.505
— I hope your mother thrives.
- She does.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.295
— And your son?
- Also.

12:08.437 --> 12:10.974
My mother sends me to ask a favour.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.771
She fears the consequences
of this last battle in Greece.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.607
Understandably.

12:19.740 --> 12:23.324
She has enjoyed
her ascendancy a little too well.

12:24.995 --> 12:30.661
She asks you to lend her some men
to protect our door in your name.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.743
Of course.

12:36.048 --> 12:39.256
Eleni, send Ajax and three or four others.

12:39.384 --> 12:43.047
— Whoever he thinks best.
— Thank you.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.387
It's very kind of you.

12:45.515 --> 12:48.473
— I told my mother she should not presume...
- Please.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.888
She shall have what she needs.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.614
Forgive me. You are so good to us.

13:04.743 --> 13:07.860
— We do not deserve it.
- Don't.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.874
I must look a fright.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.960
Not really.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.551
You look lovely.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.760
I'd better go home.

13:32.896 --> 13:36.809
— So soon?
— My mother will be worried.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.730
Well, if you feel you should.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.740
Octavia...

14:24.406 --> 14:26.237
Thank you.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.923
Send to Rome.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.419
Tell them...

14:48.555 --> 14:52.514
the decisive battle begins today.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.437
Sir! Pompey's legions
are in the field in battle array!

15:06.573 --> 15:09.155
Thank you, Fulvio.
Have you forgotten how to salute?

15:09.284 --> 15:10.865
I haven't, sir. No excuse, sir.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.701
Gracchus, sound assembly!

15:13.830 --> 15:16.697
— Have Xeno saddle my horse.
— Sir!

15:16.833 --> 15:20.041
Sound assembly!

15:20.170 --> 15:24.209
— We will accept battle?
— Certainly. Why not?

15:24.341 --> 15:30.837
We are outnumbered three to one on foot
and five to one ahorse.

15:30.972 --> 15:35.261
What uninjured men we have
are scared and hungry and desperate.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.975
That is the advantage we must press home.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.767
l was not aware irony had military usage.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.808
We must win or die.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.687
Pompey's men have other options.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.439
Goodbye, Posca.

18:29.234 --> 18:32.772
Send to Rome. Tell them Caesar has won.

19:09.899 --> 19:13.027
Sir! Caesar's men are coming!

19:13.153 --> 19:15.235
l've cut my hand.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.734
We have to go, sir! They'll catch you.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.904
It's not deep but it hurts.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.112
They will kill you!

19:26.249 --> 19:28.991
lt's of no consequence.

19:35.592 --> 19:39.210
Our forces are routed. What are we to do?

19:39.346 --> 19:41.712
We shall fight again another day,
I do not doubt.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.134
And prevail.

19:45.185 --> 19:49.098
— For the present, we must look to our safety.
— Our safety is nothing.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.892
We must leave Greece
and look to fresh levies.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.812
— And may one ask where?
— Africa.

19:54.944 --> 19:58.152
— We must rally the cities of Africa.
- Africa.

19:58.281 --> 20:01.990
— We are fast running out of continents.
— And coin!

20:02.118 --> 20:06.202
We have taxed every last coin
from Greece and spent it all.

20:06.331 --> 20:08.492
What shall we use to buy Africa's loyalty?

20:08.625 --> 20:10.911
— Seashells?
— We need buy nothing!

20:11.044 --> 20:14.662
— We are the Senate of Rome!
— We are old men with mud on our shoes!

20:14.798 --> 20:17.505
We are not beaten until we are dead.

20:17.634 --> 20:21.877
— The Republic lives as long as we do!
— You may fight on as you wish.

20:22.013 --> 20:26.973
As for me, I will go from here
and surrender myself to Caesar.

20:27.102 --> 20:29.764
Have you no dignity? No honour?

20:29.896 --> 20:32.478
Some little, I hope.

20:32.607 --> 20:34.518
Not so much as you, of course.

20:34.651 --> 20:37.313
— Caesar will kill you.
— That may be.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.938
I'm not afraid to die.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.403
I'm tired.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.987
I want to go home.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.710
Yes. My feelings exact.

20:55.839 --> 20:58.706
Brutus, without the force of your name,
the cause of...

20:58.842 --> 21:03.427
Do not! Do not talk to me of the Republic.

21:03.555 --> 21:08.219
If I had known what wretched company
and rotten food I would endure,

21:08.351 --> 21:14.517
if I had known what an old fool is Pompey,
I would never have left Rome.

21:20.238 --> 21:22.695
Forgive my anger.

21:24.451 --> 21:27.409
- I am not myself.
— Think nothing of it.

21:27.537 --> 21:30.495
l merit your disappointment.

21:32.876 --> 21:35.083
I propose we make for Amphipoli.

21:35.211 --> 21:38.669
l have men and money there.
We can go by sea to Egypt.

21:38.798 --> 21:42.211
Ptolemy's children are loyal friends of mine.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.800
Perhaps...

21:46.139 --> 21:51.224
Perhaps it's better we do not travel together.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.443
Perhaps you're right.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.605
Better.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.483
No doubt.

22:36.064 --> 22:40.307
I don't understand it.
Something should have turned up by now.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.809
I'm not meant to die this way.

22:42.946 --> 22:45.858
— You were misinformed.
— Doesn't seem right.

22:48.952 --> 22:52.695
Still...it'd be good to see my mother again.

22:54.457 --> 22:57.199
Do you think they have
a system for finding people?

22:57.335 --> 22:58.450
What?

22:58.586 --> 23:01.578
In the afterlife, how do you
go about finding people?

23:01.714 --> 23:05.002
— There must be millions of them.
- There must be.

23:11.057 --> 23:14.299
She won't recognise me, probably.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.393
l was very young when she died.

23:31.327 --> 23:34.194
Probably give her a big scare though, huh?

23:34.330 --> 23:37.618
Big, ugly brute coming along
and giving her a hug.

23:38.668 --> 23:40.704
— Look at that.
— What?

23:40.837 --> 23:45.501
That corpse.
See how high it rides in the water?

23:46.634 --> 23:49.501
The plutonic ether inflates him.

23:49.637 --> 23:51.719
What of it?

23:52.765 --> 23:55.507
You've not been drinking seawater, have you?

25:50.299 --> 25:53.587
— Husband, eat.
- Oh, yeah.

26:00.184 --> 26:03.847
— Little salty.
— Not at all. It's good.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.971
Delicious, Mama.

26:06.107 --> 26:09.065
Bona Dea, look at your faces.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.311
Sillies.

26:58.493 --> 27:01.781
Helen!

27:01.913 --> 27:04.655
Husband, wake up! Our people are leaving.

27:14.383 --> 27:18.922
Now, my darlings. Don't be scared.
We're on an adventure, eh?

27:19.055 --> 27:23.719
The first one to see the sea and cry out
will have a peach when we get to Amphipoli.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.692
You, your name again?

27:37.031 --> 27:39.943
- Lysandros.
— Lysandros, how far to Amphipoli?

27:40.076 --> 27:42.032
Very close. Close.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.777
We will continue there as planned.

27:44.914 --> 27:49.078
You're not to announce my identity
to those that we meet.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.700
And if they ask?

27:52.672 --> 27:54.628
Mela.

27:54.757 --> 27:57.419
— Aeneas Mela.
— Hear and obey, Captain.

27:58.386 --> 28:03.130
- And who'll pay?
— Pay? You've been paid already.

28:03.266 --> 28:05.632
For guiding, not for protection.

28:05.768 --> 28:09.807
l have many men and supplies
and ample coin in Amphipoli.

28:09.939 --> 28:12.931
- You will be paid there.
— None with you now? Coin?

28:13.067 --> 28:16.059
None! l'll tolerate no more of your impudence!

28:16.195 --> 28:18.811
No disrespect, Captain. Only asking.

28:18.948 --> 28:21.610
We go.

28:59.155 --> 29:02.363
You drive me insane
with your wretched muttering.

29:02.491 --> 29:05.654
What is wrong that you must
harass the gods so?

29:07.496 --> 29:10.078
- Nothing.
— Stop it then.

29:10.207 --> 29:13.370
Servilia sends to invite you
to weave with her tomorrow.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.625
- I cannot.
— You can. I've already accepted.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.749
— I cannot!
— I know she's tedious.

29:20.885 --> 29:23.251
I mean really, weaving.

29:23.387 --> 29:26.379
But we must keep her happy for the time being.

29:27.683 --> 29:29.184
But...

29:43.324 --> 29:45.360
The sea!

29:45.493 --> 29:48.200
Unison. You shall both have a peach.

30:01.258 --> 30:03.715
Look, Mama. Dead people.

30:25.908 --> 30:28.115
It's good, huh?

30:28.244 --> 30:30.280
Where do you come from?

30:30.413 --> 30:33.405
— Brindisi.
— Romans?

30:36.961 --> 30:40.579
I know you. Where do I know you from?

30:43.676 --> 30:47.589
- l have not seen you before.
— I'm sure I've seen you somewhere.

30:47.722 --> 30:50.304
Leave them water and bread,
we need to be going.

30:50.433 --> 30:54.927
— Leave them? Weak as they are?
- l have no time to waste.

30:56.397 --> 31:01.482
Soon be dark anyhow. We camp here,
get to Amphipoli in the morning.

31:01.610 --> 31:05.102
— I insist we go on.
- Relax, old man.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.275
We get there.

31:11.746 --> 31:16.410
You rest easy now, boys.
Eat, drink, get your strength back.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.407
You and me will be good friends.

31:23.174 --> 31:26.758
You want my cock up you,
or are you going to build a damn fire?

31:26.886 --> 31:29.172
I told you we'd be all right.

31:31.891 --> 31:33.882
There's no pleasing some.

31:43.277 --> 31:46.940
We stop here? Why so early?

31:47.073 --> 31:50.110
Best to, I think. It'll be dark soon.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.783
- Who are they?
— How should I know?

31:53.913 --> 31:56.495
Who cares who they are?

31:56.624 --> 31:59.912
Sorry. I...

32:01.754 --> 32:05.963
All will be well, I assure you.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.128
All will be well.

32:12.848 --> 32:17.558
Pompey Magnus.
That man looks exactly like Pompey Magnus.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.938
That's why I thought I'd met him.

32:20.064 --> 32:21.725
Don't point.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.977
- Never.
— It's hard to believe, eh?

32:28.114 --> 32:30.196
His wife and sprouts too.

32:31.742 --> 32:34.779
Caesar's going to drown us in gold.
Thank you.

32:41.043 --> 32:42.374
Cack!

32:47.174 --> 32:49.756
What do we do?

32:49.885 --> 32:51.876
I don't know yet.

32:53.973 --> 32:56.055
Thank you for coming.

32:57.226 --> 33:02.687
Mother insisted. I understand you want me
to do some weaving with you.

33:06.277 --> 33:08.643
I'm sorry you were upset.

33:08.779 --> 33:10.861
The last time we saw each other.

33:10.990 --> 33:13.072
lt's of no consequence.

33:16.245 --> 33:18.531
Are you fond of weaving?

33:21.292 --> 33:22.907
So did I.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.126
And how is your brother?

33:30.259 --> 33:32.716
— Is he still in Mediolanum?
- He is.

33:33.762 --> 33:37.926
— Lovely town, so I'm told. Healthy air.
- Domina?

33:38.058 --> 33:40.140
What is it, Eleni?

33:43.939 --> 33:46.476
Word from Greece.

33:46.609 --> 33:47.940
Caesar has won.

33:49.570 --> 33:53.108
And Pompey's armies
are completely destroyed.

33:59.955 --> 34:02.071
And my son?

34:04.793 --> 34:06.454
No word.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.816
Don't cry.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.833
Halt! In the name of Rome!

36:10.961 --> 36:14.954
Calls himself Rome now, does he? Shameless.

36:15.090 --> 36:16.830
Who are you? What's your purpose?

36:16.967 --> 36:20.334
We are Rome, boy, what's left of it.

36:21.263 --> 36:24.972
Come to surrender to your chief.

36:38.781 --> 36:41.818
Brutus! Cicero!

36:41.950 --> 36:44.032
How happy I am to see you.

36:45.079 --> 36:47.286
I thought you were dead.

36:48.290 --> 36:54.661
Sir, I am come here honourably,
with no request for mercy,

36:54.797 --> 36:57.755
to surrender my arms and my horses as is...

36:59.093 --> 37:02.005
We'll have no talk of surrender.

37:02.137 --> 37:05.629
We've merely quarrelled a little.
Now we are friends again?

37:06.683 --> 37:12.303
That is most generous of you and natural
to your manly nature but I cannot...

37:12.439 --> 37:16.307
— My poor boy.
— I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

37:16.443 --> 37:23.030
Not at all. It is I am sorry.
I presented you with an impossible dilemma.

37:23.158 --> 37:27.492
You did only what
you thought honourable, I'm sure.

37:28.956 --> 37:30.992
| kiss you for it.

37:33.502 --> 37:37.370
Thank you. I will not forget this grace.

37:37.506 --> 37:40.543
— As l was saying, a most generous...
— But what of Pompey?

37:40.676 --> 37:42.507
Tell me he lives.

37:44.346 --> 37:47.338
— He lives.
— Thank the gods. Where is he?

37:49.351 --> 37:51.433
He...

37:52.980 --> 37:55.392
He does not plan to surrender.

37:56.859 --> 38:01.694
That is insane.
He cannot escape. Where can he go?

38:02.739 --> 38:05.025
ls Scipio with him? Cato?

38:07.327 --> 38:09.363
They have fled to Africa.

38:10.706 --> 38:13.493
What am I thinking of,

38:13.625 --> 38:17.584
asking you questions
when you must be so hungry and thirsty?

38:17.713 --> 38:20.079
Come.

38:20.215 --> 38:25.505
— I think I would rather...
— I insist.

38:27.097 --> 38:29.213
Come.

38:31.727 --> 38:35.390
So with this hand, othenNise engaged,
I had to take that worm

38:35.522 --> 38:40.858
and beat him with my fists
over and over and over again!

39:29.076 --> 39:34.412
His father, King Ptolemy Auletes Xll,
was a close friend of mine.

39:34.540 --> 39:38.203
l was always assured
a loving welcome in Egypt.

39:38.335 --> 39:42.874
I remember, on one occasion
I was out hunting with the King.

39:43.006 --> 39:45.088
We were hunting lions, you see.

39:47.636 --> 39:51.470
Only the King was rather a poor bowman

39:51.598 --> 39:57.764
and we couldn't tell
if the lion was wounded or dead,

39:57.896 --> 40:03.016
so, we sneaked up on the lion, keeping both...

40:12.661 --> 40:14.697
Hello, friends.

40:14.830 --> 40:17.071
Feeling better? Strong?

40:17.207 --> 40:19.289
Strong enough.

40:21.461 --> 40:25.124
Tell me something.
What's the name of that Roman?

40:25.257 --> 40:27.168
His name is...

40:28.176 --> 40:30.132
Aeneas Mela.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.548
— Aeneas Mela?
— That's what he said.

40:34.016 --> 40:36.758
What do you hear of Caesar and Pompey?

40:38.186 --> 40:39.847
They fought, I heard.

40:41.023 --> 40:43.230
And?

40:43.358 --> 40:45.735
You know who won.

40:45.861 --> 40:47.943
Tell us.

40:51.408 --> 40:52.989
l was going to let you in anyway.

40:53.118 --> 40:56.952
— What's he talking about?
— You boys are clever fellows, I bet.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.911
Know how to fight.

40:59.041 --> 41:03.250
Me and my boys can't take his people alone.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.960
Us and you together, no problem.

41:07.007 --> 41:09.589
We go down middle on the reward.

41:09.718 --> 41:12.926
- Not a bad idea.
— You can have the wife and children.

41:13.055 --> 41:15.091
I take the slaves.

41:17.851 --> 41:21.343
Walk away and do not speak of this again.

41:21.480 --> 41:26.600
| see. Think you don't need me?
Think you can keep the reward for yourself?

41:26.735 --> 41:29.818
— Fuck you. Not going to happen.
- Don't.

41:29.946 --> 41:36.408
Fuck you! I gave you your lives back,
I can take them away again, easy.

41:37.829 --> 41:42.994
When I am finished speaking,
you will turn and run that way.

41:43.126 --> 41:45.833
That way? What about this way?

41:45.962 --> 41:50.422
Do not stop until you are out of my sight
and do not delay, or I will kill you.

41:51.510 --> 41:55.844
— What is wrong with him?
- I am finished speaking.

42:10.821 --> 42:13.233
A bit harsh, isn't it?

42:13.365 --> 42:15.947
Fair enough deal he was offering, I thought.

42:16.076 --> 42:18.067
— What is the meaning of this?
- Sir...

42:18.203 --> 42:20.159
Speak up! This man was in my employ!

42:20.288 --> 42:22.665
— He planned to assault you.
— How do you know?

42:22.791 --> 42:24.827
He asked us to participate.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.542
You refused, stabbed him
to death on my behalf.

42:27.671 --> 42:29.832
A good friend on such short acquaintance.

42:29.965 --> 42:32.502
- What is your name?
— I am Lucius Vorenus.

42:32.634 --> 42:36.377
Prefect in evocati
of the 13th Legion of Gaius Julius Caesar.

42:36.513 --> 42:38.720
Titus Pullo, legionary of same.

42:38.849 --> 42:40.885
Salve, Lucius Vorenus.

42:41.017 --> 42:46.137
l am...Aeneas Mela...of Pergamum.

42:50.902 --> 42:52.984
Aeneas Mela.

42:55.115 --> 42:57.481
You must consider yourself under my charge.

42:57.617 --> 42:59.232
I do not understand.

42:59.369 --> 43:04.705
Consider yourself
a prisoner of the 13th Legion.

43:04.833 --> 43:09.076
- I'm just a merchant.
— We know who you are, sir.

43:11.548 --> 43:16.008
I own you now! Understand?
You, you, bury him.

43:16.136 --> 43:19.299
The rest of you...don't let them leave.

43:19.431 --> 43:23.765
Lucius Vorenus, I must speak with you alone.

43:25.645 --> 43:27.681
Stay here.

43:29.191 --> 43:32.900
Of course I do not say I am who you think I am

43:33.028 --> 43:35.394
but I have spent some years in the army.

43:35.530 --> 43:38.522
Perhaps we met on some campaign or other.

43:38.658 --> 43:41.240
Perhaps that's why I seem familiar.

43:41.369 --> 43:43.155
Perhaps.

43:46.041 --> 43:51.752
— I recall the 13th was at Alesia.
- We were.

43:51.880 --> 43:55.589
There's a battle I've always
wished to have seen.

43:55.717 --> 43:58.083
25 miles of works, wasn't it?

43:58.220 --> 44:00.586
— Nearer 30.
— 30?

44:00.722 --> 44:02.883
— How many men did you have?
- 60,000.

44:03.016 --> 44:08.306
Against almost double the Gauls.

44:08.438 --> 44:11.896
At least double.
The best men of every tribe in Gaul.

44:12.025 --> 44:17.361
Caesar can fight. I'll give him that.

44:17.489 --> 44:21.152
l remember...when he was
not much older than you.

44:21.284 --> 44:24.993
I sent him to winter quarters in...

44:27.499 --> 44:29.581
Now, where was it?

44:31.086 --> 44:33.452
No matter.

44:33.588 --> 44:35.704
Long time gone.

44:43.098 --> 44:48.092
I must ask you, sir, if I may,
how did you come to this road?

44:49.771 --> 44:54.481
Surely Pompey had Caesar
at greater disadvantage.

44:54.609 --> 44:57.521
He did.

44:58.572 --> 45:00.608
It didn't seem possible to lose.

45:02.158 --> 45:04.194
That's always a bad sign.

45:05.245 --> 45:09.204
The battlefield was on a plain

45:09.332 --> 45:14.918
by a river at the foot of some low hills.

45:15.046 --> 45:17.423
Like this, you see.

45:17.549 --> 45:20.211
The lines met here.

45:20.343 --> 45:27.511
My men held their ground well,
so I sent my horses at his right flank.

45:27.642 --> 45:32.352
— Which is perfectly correct, you'll agree.
— I do.

45:32.480 --> 45:38.851
Only the cowards were repulsed.
Repulsed by a single cohort of reserves.

45:38.987 --> 45:41.729
Turned and fled, 200 horses.

45:41.865 --> 45:45.278
Crashed directly into my left flank.

45:46.369 --> 45:50.533
Rolled up my line like a carpet.

45:50.665 --> 45:53.452
Put the whole damned army to flight.

45:54.628 --> 45:56.835
And here I am.

45:56.963 --> 46:01.923
That's how Pompey Magnus was defeated.

46:02.052 --> 46:04.794
That's how the Republic died.

46:17.359 --> 46:20.226
— Good night, sir.
— Wait.

46:20.362 --> 46:22.648
lwill not...

46:24.991 --> 46:28.859
I will not ask favour or mercy for myself.

46:28.995 --> 46:33.534
But I beg you, consider the fate...

46:35.210 --> 46:37.496
of my wife and children.

46:40.590 --> 46:45.425
Let me take them to Egypt
where they will be safe...

46:47.305 --> 46:49.387
among friends.

46:52.060 --> 46:54.142
Consider them.

48:04.883 --> 48:07.169
Go back to sleep.

48:21.149 --> 48:24.812
Unwise and unfriendly, I call it.

48:24.944 --> 48:26.935
Unwise and unfriendly.

48:27.072 --> 48:29.529
And for why? Why?

48:30.784 --> 48:32.900
We had him.

48:34.370 --> 48:36.952
Horses. Never mind horses.

48:37.082 --> 48:39.448
Never mind gold.

48:39.584 --> 48:41.575
Caesar would have given us farms

48:41.711 --> 48:44.919
and fields and orchards
and great flocks of slaves

48:45.048 --> 48:47.039
and cattle and Dis knows what...

48:47.175 --> 48:51.134
Desist! Pompey Magnus is
no damn slave to be sold for money.

48:54.140 --> 48:57.428
- Don't see why not!
— There's a great deal you don't see.

48:58.353 --> 49:01.015
There's a great deal he doesn't see neither.

49:12.867 --> 49:16.780
You and only 12 other men
survived that storm.

49:17.872 --> 49:20.249
Out of 5,000.

49:20.375 --> 49:25.039
You're being kept alive
for some great purpose, no doubt.

49:25.171 --> 49:27.628
Well. You know, sir...

49:31.469 --> 49:34.677
— He has some interesting news.
—|ndeed?

49:34.806 --> 49:38.014
On our journey here,
we encountered Gnaeus Pompey Magnus

49:38.143 --> 49:41.351
with his family and a party of servants.

49:41.479 --> 49:44.812
- Where?
— The road to Amphipoli, with a mule train.

49:44.941 --> 49:47.603
A mule train. lt's priceless.

49:47.735 --> 49:50.112
He intends to take ship for Egypt, sir.

49:50.238 --> 49:52.320
Family and servants, you say.

49:52.448 --> 49:54.188
— No soldiers?
— None, sir.

49:54.325 --> 49:58.113
Not one man left, not one. Poor wretch.

49:59.998 --> 50:02.614
Why then, be that so,
did you not apprehend him?

50:02.750 --> 50:05.082
Now, here's the onion.

50:06.880 --> 50:09.838
I thought it would be wrong to do so.

50:09.966 --> 50:11.877
Explain yourself.

50:13.595 --> 50:17.087
His hands trembled, sir, his clothes were dirty,

50:17.223 --> 50:20.090
there was water in his eyes, he is broken.

50:20.226 --> 50:22.808
I saw no need to apprehend him.

50:22.937 --> 50:26.771
I'd like to add that Legionary Pullo
took no part in my decision, sir.

50:28.568 --> 50:30.650
You saw no need...

50:31.946 --> 50:33.982
Do you not see that Pompey may be broken

50:34.115 --> 50:37.778
like a Dacian catamite and still be dangerous?

50:37.911 --> 50:43.372
If he is still living, he will be a standard
around which our enemies will gather!

50:44.459 --> 50:48.668
As long as he can be propped
on a horse, he's dangerous!

50:48.796 --> 50:51.754
— But you saw no need to apprehend him?
— I did not, sir.

50:51.883 --> 50:54.875
Who by the sons of Dis gives you
the right to make such judgment?

50:55.011 --> 50:59.471
Sir, I am aware that l have not done my duty
and I respectfully ask your pardon.

51:00.934 --> 51:02.970
My pardon, he asks.

51:05.230 --> 51:08.222
I ought to have you scourged and crucified.

51:16.783 --> 51:22.699
In future you will remember
that it is I that offers mercy. No one else.

51:22.830 --> 51:25.162
- Clear?
— Clear, sir.

51:26.167 --> 51:27.828
Dismissed.

51:32.382 --> 51:37.376
I do not like to disagree with you
but you are being far too lenient with him.

51:37.512 --> 51:41.175
He let Pompey go and you let him live?

51:41.307 --> 51:43.684
The man should be made an example of!

51:43.810 --> 51:46.392
Any other man, certainly.

51:46.521 --> 51:50.730
But those two, they found my stolen standard.

51:50.858 --> 51:53.691
Now they survive a wreck
that drowned an army

51:53.820 --> 51:56.732
and find Pompey Magnus on a beach.

51:58.241 --> 52:02.234
They have powerful gods on their side

52:02.370 --> 52:05.862
and lwill not kill any man
with friends of that sort.

52:07.166 --> 52:08.906
Posca.

52:09.043 --> 52:12.535
Tell Fulvio to start breaking camp.

52:12.672 --> 52:14.754
We're going to Egypt.

53:05.391 --> 53:07.347
General Pompey, sir.

53:07.477 --> 53:10.389
Remember me? Lucius Septimius.

53:10.521 --> 53:13.308
Centurion Septimius, as was.

53:13.441 --> 53:16.649
l was with you in Spain.
Fourth Legion, third cohort.

53:16.778 --> 53:19.815
Lucius Septimius, of course.

53:19.947 --> 53:21.858
What are you doing here, of all places?

53:21.991 --> 53:23.982
Working for the gippoes, sir.

53:24.118 --> 53:26.495
I know, sir. It's not the Fourth by no means.

53:26.621 --> 53:29.579
— A man's got to earn his salt...
- True enough.

53:29.707 --> 53:31.993
What's all this then, soldier?

53:32.126 --> 53:33.957
Not much of a welcome party.

53:34.087 --> 53:38.330
You know Egyptians, sir,
it's just their way. Funny people.

53:38.466 --> 53:42.425
That they are. Well...onward, friend.

53:56.109 --> 53:58.316
I'm sorry, sir.
