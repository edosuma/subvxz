- if we didn't protect that thing.
- What does that even mean?

34:09.881 --> 34:11.337
It means our town
is as good as dead

34:11.508 --> 34:13.089
if we let this fall
into the wrong hands.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.000
NORRIE:
Doesn't get more wrong than Big Jim.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.509
Dome told us as much.

34:16.680 --> 34:20.343
JOE: How do we protect Chester's Mill
and save Barbie?

34:25.021 --> 34:26.932
We can't.

34:27.357 --> 34:28.688
So, what the hell do we do?

34:30.110 --> 34:32.021
We don't do anything.

34:33.363 --> 34:36.025
If I'm really the monarch,
this has to be my decision.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.657
You three have done enough.
I want you to go get somewhere safe.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.614
What are you gonna do?

35:51.232 --> 35:52.517
JIM:
I know you're scared.

35:53.526 --> 35:55.232
I'm scared too.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.110
From the very first day
this dome appeared,

35:59.032 --> 36:01.774
elements from outside our fair town

36:01.951 --> 36:05.785
have attempted to sow the seeds
of fear and hatred

36:05.955 --> 36:07.081
in an effort to divide us.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.491
No more.

36:10.669 --> 36:16.130
Today Chester's Mill
sentences Dale Barbara to death.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.922
JIM:
Fuends,

38:27.096 --> 38:30.714
clearly the good Lord has looked upon
our work here today with favor.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.757
Let us thank him for this blessing.

39:11.099 --> 39:13.932
JUNIOR: Dad, what's happening?
- Now, son.

39:14.519 --> 39:15.725
Do it now.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.682
Now, Junior! Do it now!
