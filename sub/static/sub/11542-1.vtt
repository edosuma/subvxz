01:00.232 --> 01:04.446
Trees have a secret life
that is only revealed

01:04.447 --> 01:06.342
to those who are willing
to climb them.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.094
I do not remember
when I was born.

01:24.147 --> 01:25.728
But, when I was three
months old,

01:25.728 --> 01:28.467
my mother returned
to my grandparents' home

01:28.467 --> 01:30.995
with me as the proof
of her failure.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.702
The splendor of my childhood
was unique,

01:57.439 --> 02:02.391
because of its absolute poverty,
and absolute freedom...

02:04.076 --> 02:05.867
out in the open,

02:05.867 --> 02:09.344
surrounded by trees,
animals, and people

02:09.345 --> 02:11.767
who were indifferent
toward me.

02:21.565 --> 02:23.567
Reinaldo!

02:24.937 --> 02:26.728
Reinaldo!

02:29.572 --> 02:31.995
Niño, apúrate con esa agua,
Dios mío!

02:31.996 --> 02:33.892
Mira que hay que esperar
en esta casa!

02:33.892 --> 02:37.684
My early life was surrounded
by a room full of unhappy women

02:37.685 --> 02:41.161
who were all bossed around
by my grandmother,

02:41.162 --> 02:44.216
the heart of the house,

02:44.217 --> 02:47.272
the only woman I ever saw
who peed standing up

02:47.273 --> 02:49.800
and talked to God
at the same time.

02:51.170 --> 02:55.700
My mother was a very beautiful
and very lonely woman.

02:55.701 --> 02:58.650
She had only known one man,
my father,

02:58.651 --> 03:03.075
and had enjoyed the pleasures
of love for only a few months

03:03.076 --> 03:07.921
and then, gave that all up
for the rest of her life,

03:07.922 --> 03:12.346
creating in her
a great sense of frustration.

03:12.347 --> 03:15.190
Her chastity was worse
than that of a virgin.

03:15.191 --> 03:16.981
Hijo de puta!

03:16.982 --> 03:19.088
Vete de aquí!

03:20.247 --> 03:21.933
Animal!

03:35.524 --> 03:37.736
Hijo de puta!

03:43.531 --> 03:45.216
Desgraciado!

03:45.216 --> 03:47.955
The most extraordinary
event of my childhood

03:47.956 --> 03:50.063
was provided by the heavens.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.181
Water rushed down gutters,

03:53.183 --> 03:56.820
reverberating over
the zinc roof like gunfire

03:56.821 --> 03:59.835
a massive army marching
across the trees,

03:59.836 --> 04:05.553
overflowing, cascading,
thundering into barrels,

04:05.554 --> 04:07.737
a concert of drums,

04:07.737 --> 04:09.712
water falling on water,

04:09.713 --> 04:13.039
drenched and whistling
and out of control,

04:13.040 --> 04:15.222
and under the spell of violence,

04:15.223 --> 04:20.005
let loose that would sweep away
almost everything in its path.

04:20.005 --> 04:23.851
Trees, stones,
animals, houses.

04:23.853 --> 04:26.866
It was the mystery
of destruction.

04:26.868 --> 04:28.634
The law of life.

04:28.634 --> 04:30.297
As I saw it,

04:30.401 --> 04:32.897
the currents were
roaring my name.

04:36.223 --> 04:39.758
Flowers have
reproductive organs.

04:39.758 --> 04:44.749
Class, can anyone
tell us what the male

04:44.750 --> 04:47.764
reproductive organ is called?

04:50.883 --> 04:52.650
Reinaldo?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.249
Reinaldo?

04:55.249 --> 04:58.368
A dick.
A long, skinny dick.

05:05.854 --> 05:08.245
Don't ask her where
she comes from.

05:08.246 --> 05:11.260
Can't you see she
is from the garden

05:11.261 --> 05:14.899
and the most beautiful
flower of them all?

05:56.381 --> 05:58.772
Buenas tardes,
con permiso.

05:59.812 --> 06:02.931
Señor Fuentes, I didn't mean
to disturb your dinner.

06:02.932 --> 06:04.179
What did he do?

06:04.283 --> 06:06.882
No, he didn't do
anything wrong.

06:06.883 --> 06:11.248
I came here to tell you that
Reinaldo has a special gift.

06:12.496 --> 06:14.055
What special gift?

06:14.159 --> 06:17.070
He has a sensitivity
for poetry.

07:15.395 --> 07:17.579
After that, my grandfather
sold the farm

07:17.580 --> 07:20.490
and moved the family
to Holguín,

07:20.491 --> 07:22.569
opened a grocery store,

07:22.569 --> 07:24.856
and refused to speak
to any of us.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.185
Holguín was a town
of 200,000 people

07:33.185 --> 07:35.273
and one garbage truck.

07:56.567 --> 08:00.011
The rebels are in Velasco.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.890
We can walk it in a day.

08:01.891 --> 08:03.873
Okay.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.857
We'll leave tonight.

08:05.858 --> 08:07.318
'Tá bien.

08:07.318 --> 08:10.554
You think you can
do it with her?

08:10.555 --> 08:12.850
My name is Reinaldo.
What is yours?

08:12.851 --> 08:14.103
Loly.

08:14.207 --> 08:16.921
- Would you like to dance?
- Cómo no.

08:36.232 --> 08:38.528
¿Qué tú quieres?
Tú eres muy niño.

08:42.285 --> 08:45.417
Incorpórate a la lucha.

08:45.418 --> 08:51.158
Radio Rebelde, transmitiendo
desde las montañas de Oriente,

08:51.159 --> 08:53.664
desde la Sierra Maestra,

08:53.665 --> 08:56.691
territorio libre de Cuba.

08:56.692 --> 08:58.674
Aquí Radio Rebelde.

10:27.399 --> 10:29.382
Where are you going, kid?

10:29.383 --> 10:32.096
- Up the road.
- Up the road where?

10:32.097 --> 10:33.140
Velasco.

10:34.810 --> 10:37.628
Velasco?
You are not from Velasco.

10:37.629 --> 10:42.326
I am from Velasco.
Why do you go to Velasco for?

10:42.327 --> 10:45.770
Ah, the rebels
are in Velasco.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.545
You going to join
the rebels?

10:47.545 --> 10:51.511
Your mamá know you are
going to join the rebels?

10:51.512 --> 10:52.868
No.

10:52.868 --> 10:54.121
No.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.687
Where she is?

10:55.687 --> 10:57.879
She's in Miami, working.

10:57.879 --> 11:07.899
Would you like to see?

11:07.900 --> 11:11.970
It's upside down.

11:11.971 --> 11:13.432
Qué bonita.

11:19.173 --> 11:20.843
You want to hit things?

11:23.243 --> 11:27.106
Sometimes I like
to hit things.

11:27.107 --> 11:32.533
My mother, she has
a store in Velasco.

11:32.535 --> 11:35.978
Before that it was my
grandmother's store,

11:35.979 --> 11:38.588
and before that,
it was her mother's store.

11:38.589 --> 11:40.153
I have six brothers.

11:40.153 --> 11:43.911
They all want
to join the rebels.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.625
The second one,
he joined the rebels.

11:46.626 --> 11:51.218
I'm the middle one,
I don't join the rebels.

11:57.690 --> 11:59.568
Get that for me.

12:12.094 --> 12:13.764
Go home.

12:14.808 --> 12:17.105
The rebels are no more
in Velasco.

12:17.105 --> 12:19.192
Go on, get off.

12:19.297 --> 12:20.654
Get off!

12:22.637 --> 12:24.307
What?
What?

12:49.672 --> 12:51.968
Que viva Fidel!

12:51.969 --> 12:53.534
Viva Fidel!

12:53.534 --> 12:54.578
Cuba libre!

15:26.767 --> 15:28.229
Translator: Es todo por hoy.

15:28.229 --> 15:29.690
Spaziva!

15:49.836 --> 15:53.489
As my mother smacked me,
she cursed

15:53.490 --> 15:56.621
and yelled, "Maldito!
Bad seed!"

15:56.622 --> 15:59.230
She shouted at the sky,
"I want to get out of here. "

15:59.231 --> 16:02.466
But I really wasn't sure
that's what she wanted.

16:07.790 --> 16:11.339
But now standing over me

16:11.339 --> 16:13.426
she looked like
a huge tree trunk.

16:13.844 --> 16:18.854
And if it didn't hurt so much,
I'd get down on my knees,

16:18.855 --> 16:21.986
and ask her to smack me again,
even harder.

16:23.238 --> 16:25.535
Then she became beautiful.

16:25.536 --> 16:29.397
How pretty she is in her skirt
made out of a sack

16:29.398 --> 16:32.424
and the blouse she stole
from her sister.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.138
I wanted to get up and beg
her forgiveness.

16:35.138 --> 16:39.939
I wanted to say,
"Mom, how pretty you are today.

16:39.940 --> 16:41.505
You look like
one of those women

16:41.505 --> 16:43.697
that you can only see
on Christmas cards, "

16:43.697 --> 16:48.812
but I said nothing because
of the the knot in my throat.

16:51.317 --> 16:54.448
That was very nice.
What's your name?

16:54.448 --> 16:56.014
Reinaldo Arenas.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.580
Who wrote this?

16:57.580 --> 17:00.085
I did, it's my own--
from my novel.

17:00.085 --> 17:01.860
What do you call this novel?

17:01.860 --> 17:03.634
"Singing from the Well. "

17:03.635 --> 17:05.095
Are you a student?

17:05.095 --> 17:08.749
Yes, I'm an agricultural
accountant.

17:13.968 --> 17:16.578
Tell me, do you think
you'd feel at home

17:16.578 --> 17:18.455
working in the national library?

17:18.457 --> 17:20.440
The pay won't be very much.

17:20.441 --> 17:23.362
But I can promise you
that you'll have all the books

17:23.363 --> 17:25.137
you could ever hope to read.

17:25.137 --> 17:27.016
I would like that
very much.

17:27.017 --> 17:28.373
Thank you very much.

17:32.339 --> 17:32.861
Thank you.

17:48.414 --> 17:51.650
Oye, need a lift?

17:51.650 --> 17:53.216
I want to go down
to Guayanos.

17:53.216 --> 17:55.303
Get in.

17:57.391 --> 17:58.957
Hello.

18:03.967 --> 18:05.742
Driver: You like it, right?

18:06.159 --> 18:09.291
It used to belong
to Errol Flynn.

18:10.752 --> 18:12.109
You don't believe me?

18:12.213 --> 18:13.779
Look in the glove
compartment.

18:18.789 --> 18:21.190
Be careful, huh?

18:22.860 --> 18:25.261
Do you want to go
to the movies with me?

18:25.262 --> 18:26.305
What?

18:26.409 --> 18:28.079
Do you want to go
to the movies with me?

18:28.079 --> 18:30.689
- I'll get out here!
- Ay, coño!

18:34.864 --> 18:37.369
You got a flat ass anyway!

18:37.683 --> 18:39.666
Vamos, chico, vamos!

18:39.667 --> 18:42.067
You'll see him tomorrow.

18:42.068 --> 18:43.945
Get out!

18:50.522 --> 18:52.192
Estúpido!

18:55.636 --> 18:58.554
... last Saturday night
I made 100 pesos

18:58.555 --> 19:01.368
for letting 10 members
of the National Ballet

19:01.369 --> 19:02.514
suck me off.

19:03.660 --> 19:05.744
Doesn't that make you a fag?

19:05.744 --> 19:08.037
If you do it for money,
you're not a fag.

19:44.196 --> 19:46.593
You know him?

19:46.593 --> 19:47.635
No.

19:53.367 --> 19:54.304
Hello.

19:54.304 --> 19:55.659
I'm sorry about the other day.

19:55.763 --> 19:56.805
No, don't worry.
Forget it.

19:56.805 --> 19:58.890
- I am Reinaldo.
- I am Pepe.

19:58.891 --> 20:00.869
- How about some ice cream?
- Yes!

20:00.869 --> 20:03.058
Today they have only vanilla.

20:03.891 --> 20:07.226
Bring him a banana split
with pistacho.

20:07.226 --> 20:08.998
One ice cream!

20:09.519 --> 20:10.352
Go.

20:11.290 --> 20:14.208
So where you from,
Reinaldo?

20:14.209 --> 20:16.396
I am a guajiro,
from Oriente.

20:16.397 --> 20:18.376
- Does it matter where I'm from?
- No.

20:18.377 --> 20:19.731
What do you do?

20:19.835 --> 20:22.649
I just got a job now
in the National Library,

20:22.650 --> 20:25.358
but I would like to be
a writer.

20:26.921 --> 20:29.735
You poor thing.

20:29.736 --> 20:32.340
A country boy in Havana
to serve the Revolution.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.618
- Where's your mother?
- En la bodega.

20:51.619 --> 20:53.494
Give me the key.

20:53.494 --> 20:55.265
Chau.

20:55.266 --> 20:56.203
Vamos!

21:11.209 --> 21:13.293
She says it works,

21:13.293 --> 21:15.585
just one key is a little off.

21:15.586 --> 21:17.774
How can I thank you?

21:22.255 --> 21:23.609
What are you doing?

21:23.610 --> 21:24.964
Who is the man?

21:26.423 --> 21:28.299
Who's the man?

21:28.300 --> 21:31.008
You, because you are
the judo expert.

21:36.114 --> 21:38.823
You don't kiss
on the lips?

21:38.824 --> 21:41.324
Only when I'm in love.

21:44.972 --> 21:48.828
Patricio Lamumba Beach is only
a 10 minute walk from here--

21:48.829 --> 21:51.851
La Concha is about a mile...

21:51.851 --> 21:53.831
This is perfect for you.

21:53.831 --> 21:58.000
You'll have to share
the bathroom with her.

21:58.001 --> 22:00.293
Bedsheets are changed
every two weeks

22:00.293 --> 22:03.316
and you are responsible
for your own towel.

22:03.733 --> 22:05.609
It is perfect, I'll take it.

22:05.610 --> 22:08.111
Don't you want to know
how much?

22:08.111 --> 22:10.091
It doesn't matter,
I can not afford it anyway.

22:10.091 --> 22:12.593
30 pesos a month--

22:13.843 --> 22:16.970
and no visitors...

22:16.971 --> 22:18.951
nor music after 10:00pm.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.931
30.

22:29.374 --> 22:31.458
Thank you.

22:53.764 --> 22:55.848
National Book Award Contest.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.415
Hello.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.082
I would like
to submit this please.

23:04.187 --> 23:05.542
Put it in the box.

26:18.472 --> 26:20.765
Hey, you want a smoke?

26:20.766 --> 26:21.912
No, thank you.

26:34.524 --> 26:37.651
What are you reading?

26:37.652 --> 26:39.839
Este es "El Lazarillo
de Tormes. "

26:39.839 --> 26:41.299
Who wrote it?

26:44.530 --> 26:45.885
No author,
he's anonymous.

26:48.074 --> 26:52.139
No writer?
That's impossible.

26:52.140 --> 26:53.598
No, no, no,
I didn't say no writer.

26:53.598 --> 26:55.370
I said we don't know
who the author is.

26:56.933 --> 27:01.102
Okay.
Do you have any other books?

27:01.103 --> 27:03.083
Yes, I have many.

27:05.167 --> 27:08.190
I usually read out here
so I can be alone.

27:08.190 --> 27:10.900
I like it here.

27:10.900 --> 27:13.089
Sorry to bother you.
I'll leave.

27:13.089 --> 27:15.278
It's okay.
I'm going home anyway.

27:23.199 --> 27:24.971
You live around here?

27:24.971 --> 27:27.577
Not far.

27:28.202 --> 27:30.495
You want to come over
and hear some music?

27:30.495 --> 27:33.205
What?

27:33.206 --> 27:34.873
I have some
French records.

27:34.873 --> 27:35.915
Maybe you like...

27:38.730 --> 27:42.586
Edith Piaf,
and Jacques Brel.

27:45.609 --> 27:47.276
Pero estúpido idiota!

27:47.276 --> 27:49.778
Are you out of your mind?

27:49.779 --> 27:50.924
Take the book with you.

27:51.863 --> 27:54.573
Ojalá se te caiga
la pinga, maricón!

27:54.574 --> 27:56.657
Estúpido!
Coño.

28:00.409 --> 28:02.181
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

28:02.182 --> 28:06.351
we have arrived at this
auspicious moment.

28:06.352 --> 28:10.416
We are happy to announce
that the first prize goes to,

28:10.417 --> 28:14.272
"Vivir en Candonga"
by Ezequiel Vieta.

28:27.092 --> 28:31.991
And the honorable mention
goes to Reinaldo Arenas

28:31.992 --> 28:34.076
for "Celestino Antes de Alba. "

28:42.831 --> 28:44.290
Thank you.
Gracias.

28:45.541 --> 28:47.730
Thank you for coming
ladies and gentlemen,

28:47.731 --> 28:50.753
and another round of applause
for our contestants.

29:00.133 --> 29:01.280
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

29:01.384 --> 29:03.156
You're invited to
Lezama Lima's house.

29:14.413 --> 29:15.976
Hello.

29:41.409 --> 29:45.369
He left after his brother
made the film "P. M. "

29:45.371 --> 29:46.724
You've heard about it.

29:46.725 --> 29:49.434
The brother had to leave, too.

29:49.435 --> 29:51.102
Simple film.

29:53.916 --> 29:57.252
Just a group of people
dancing and getting drunk.

29:58.919 --> 30:01.734
It made no judgments.

30:03.089 --> 30:05.069
It made no judgments.

30:06.216 --> 30:11.427
People that make art are
dangerous to any dictatorship.

30:14.450 --> 30:16.847
They create beauty.

30:18.306 --> 30:20.912
And beauty is the enemy.

30:21.329 --> 30:24.247
Artists are escapists.

30:24.664 --> 30:27.270
Artists are counter-
revolutionary,

30:27.271 --> 30:32.065
and so you are a counter-
revolutionary, Reinaldo Arenas,

30:32.066 --> 30:33.420
and you know why?

30:35.400 --> 30:40.090
Because there's a man
that cannot govern

30:40.091 --> 30:43.009
the terrain called beauty,
so he wants to eliminate it.

30:43.010 --> 30:46.400
So, here we are, 400 years
of Cuban culture

30:46.401 --> 30:49.791
about to become extinct
and everybody applauds.

30:49.791 --> 30:51.187
And what happened to your lip?

30:52.085 --> 30:55.077
I found somebody who doesn't
like French music, that's all.

30:55.078 --> 30:56.972
Be careful.
Be careful.

30:56.972 --> 30:59.365
No, no, no.
Keep it--

30:59.366 --> 31:01.160
He would love for you
to have it.

31:02.457 --> 31:06.047
There are 150 books that
contain everything

31:06.047 --> 31:07.942
that literature has to offer.

31:07.942 --> 31:10.535
You read them and you don't have
to read anything else.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.330
So which book would
be the first?

31:12.331 --> 31:14.933
"The Bible. "
You have to read the Bible.

31:14.934 --> 31:17.535
Oh, croquettes.
Ooh, María Luisa.

31:22.220 --> 31:26.800
These croquettes don't stick
to the roof of your mouth.

31:29.090 --> 31:30.756
They are delicious.

31:30.756 --> 31:31.797
What kind are they?

31:31.797 --> 31:33.254
I n this country, you don't
ask that question.

31:33.256 --> 31:35.649
We're all being placed
on an international diet.

31:35.650 --> 31:36.690
Let's go back
to the Bible,

31:36.794 --> 31:38.980
it's far
more interesting.

31:38.980 --> 31:42.207
Now, I don't mean
to convert you.

31:42.207 --> 31:43.769
Just read it like a novel.

31:43.770 --> 31:47.308
I tell you what, I'm going
to give you five books--

31:47.309 --> 31:50.223
Correction, I'm going to lend
you five books.

31:50.224 --> 31:53.346
You return them,
then I'll give you five more.

31:53.347 --> 31:55.532
"Moby Dick, " Melville,

31:55.533 --> 31:58.447
Robert Lewis Stevenson's
"Treasure lsland, "

31:58.448 --> 32:00.945
Proust's,
"Remembrance of Things Past"

32:00.946 --> 32:03.235
Kafka's "Metamorphosis, "

32:03.235 --> 32:05.630
Flaubert's,
"Sentimental Education. "

32:06.358 --> 32:08.440
María Luisa,
coffee please.

32:09.794 --> 32:11.771
One, two, three--

32:11.772 --> 32:14.999
four, five.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.122
Reinaldo, I don't mean
to be presumptuous,

32:18.122 --> 32:19.787
but we've read your book.

32:19.788 --> 32:22.286
We both think
it's far superior

32:22.287 --> 32:23.951
to the one
that won first prize.

32:23.952 --> 32:25.929
They robbed you
of the first prize.

32:25.929 --> 32:27.595
But, to be frank,

32:27.595 --> 32:29.989
there's always room
for improvement.

32:31.342 --> 32:33.008
If you'll allow,

32:33.008 --> 32:36.131
Virgilio would like
to help you clean it up.

32:36.132 --> 32:38.213
Right now it's good,

32:38.213 --> 32:40.711
but it's too good
not to be great.

32:40.711 --> 32:42.065
Let's fix it.

32:42.065 --> 32:44.771
Second prize
gets published too.

32:44.772 --> 32:46.333
That's the real prize.

32:46.334 --> 32:49.143
We both think that
you were born to write.

33:02.156 --> 33:04.134
You can't be too careful.

33:04.134 --> 33:08.194
This is the only possession
that you really need.

33:08.818 --> 33:11.213
... de la vida.

33:21.623 --> 33:23.809
Las lagartijas son muy grandes
en este bañado.

33:23.913 --> 33:25.370
Si tú las vieras!
Las lagartijas...

33:25.370 --> 33:27.764
tienen aquí distintas formas...

33:46.502 --> 33:48.376
Where's Pepe?

33:48.376 --> 33:49.730
He's getting supplies.

33:51.187 --> 33:52.853
I don't have to work today.

33:52.853 --> 33:55.143
Let's pick up
Nicolas and Juan.

33:55.143 --> 33:57.121
Okay.

33:57.121 --> 34:00.556
Look, look, Tomás.
"Celestino Antes de Alba. "

34:00.557 --> 34:01.389
Now, you are really a writer.

34:01.493 --> 34:03.367
- You like that cover?
- I like it, it's beautiful.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.531
I thank Virgilio
for this book.

34:07.532 --> 34:10.237
He gave me a lesson
in literature and editing.

34:10.550 --> 34:12.735
... my brothers Juan
and Nicholas are writers too.

34:12.737 --> 34:13.985
Oh, come on.

34:14.089 --> 34:16.483
Pepe, we've got the Bronte
sisters in the back-seat.

34:16.483 --> 34:17.628
Look at them.

34:25.123 --> 34:28.351
Lezama is a Catholic;
Virgilio is an atheist.

34:29.288 --> 34:31.369
So what do they
have in common

34:31.369 --> 34:32.827
besides being faggots?

34:32.827 --> 34:35.221
Lezama doesn't type,
he writes everything by hand.

34:35.221 --> 34:37.614
Something you
wouldn't understand

34:37.617 --> 34:39.906
It's called
intellectual honesty.

34:40.842 --> 34:42.404
I don't understand!

34:42.405 --> 34:45.007
Well, if you took the time
to actually read their books,

34:45.007 --> 34:47.297
maybe you'd have something
intelligent to say about it.

34:50.212 --> 34:51.460
Oye,
look at this.

34:53.647 --> 34:55.000
Give him the cigarettes.

35:01.038 --> 35:02.808
Oye, guapo!

35:18.110 --> 35:19.255
Maricones!

35:30.290 --> 35:32.788
Mariquita! ¡Mariquita!

35:32.790 --> 35:35.183
Hazle comer
el mojón de caballo!

35:46.113 --> 35:48.924
Coño! ¿Qué es eso?

35:48.925 --> 35:49.653
¿Qué pasa ahora?

35:49.653 --> 35:52.463
Oye, welcome to our picnic,
compañero.

35:52.463 --> 35:55.066
Tranquilo,
no te muevas de allí.

35:55.066 --> 35:57.252
- What do you want?
- Shut up.

35:59.126 --> 36:00.375
What do I want?

36:00.791 --> 36:03.394
I want Carlos first
to frisk this guy.

36:03.394 --> 36:04.331
Why him?

36:04.435 --> 36:05.788
See if he's got a weapon.

36:05.788 --> 36:07.246
He's not even dressed.

36:09.119 --> 36:10.889
What's your name?

36:12.034 --> 36:13.492
My name?

36:14.845 --> 36:16.719
Franz Kafka.

36:16.719 --> 36:18.801
Franz Kafka.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.362
You're funny.

36:20.363 --> 36:22.340
You think I'm ignorant?

36:24.318 --> 36:25.879
Let's see how
ignorant you are.

36:25.881 --> 36:29.835
Ever heard of a summer camp
called La Isla de la Juventud?

36:31.709 --> 36:36.810
No, then maybe
you can tell me...

36:37.435 --> 36:42.535
when was the last time
you took it up your ass?

36:42.536 --> 36:44.722
The last time?

36:44.722 --> 36:46.179
Oh, I don't remember.

36:46.387 --> 36:49.198
You don't remember?

36:50.135 --> 36:52.113
But, I remember
the last time you did.

36:52.113 --> 36:55.756
When was that?

36:55.757 --> 36:57.630
Maybe the last time
you bent over

36:57.631 --> 36:58.983
to tie your boots?

37:15.743 --> 37:19.075
Está bien,
lo ves, ¿no?

37:25.425 --> 37:26.778
Está bien, está bien.

37:30.317 --> 37:31.567
Do you have a cigarette?

37:31.671 --> 37:35.418
Yes, I have a cigarette.

37:44.891 --> 37:46.973
There was also a sexual
revolution going on

37:46.973 --> 37:50.721
that came along with excitement
of the official revolution--

37:53.428 --> 37:57.904
but the drums of militarism
were still trying to beat down

37:57.905 --> 38:00.819
the rhythm of poetry and life.

38:02.797 --> 38:05.295
When I wasn't at my job
at the library,

38:05.296 --> 38:08.626
or guard duty,
or attending rallies,

38:09.667 --> 38:10.916
there were three
wonderful things

38:10.916 --> 38:13.116
that I enjoyed
in the 60's:

38:13.535 --> 38:18.040
my typewriter, at which I sat
like a dedicated performer

38:18.040 --> 38:19.716
sitting at his piano;

38:20.554 --> 38:22.649
the youth of those days,

38:22.649 --> 38:25.268
when everyone was ready
to break free;

38:25.792 --> 38:29.877
and lastly, the full discovery
of the sea.

40:07.510 --> 40:10.339
Did you ever notice there
are four categories of gays?

40:10.340 --> 40:12.538
Really?

40:12.538 --> 40:13.062
Really.

40:13.062 --> 40:14.738
Which are they?

40:14.739 --> 40:18.300
Well, the first one
is the dog collar gay--

40:18.301 --> 40:19.348
He's loud,

40:19.348 --> 40:22.385
shows off that
he's gay,

40:22.387 --> 40:24.690
there's no limit
to his sexual voracity,

40:24.691 --> 40:27.519
therefore he's constantly
being arrested.

40:27.520 --> 40:29.823
The system has created
a permanent collar

40:29.823 --> 40:31.080
around his neck,

40:31.080 --> 40:32.337
so they can
hook him up

40:32.337 --> 40:33.909
and take him to
a rehabilitation camp

40:33.909 --> 40:35.375
like a Valparaíso.

40:35.585 --> 40:37.889
Two is the common gay.

40:37.890 --> 40:40.404
He's made his commitments
with other gays,

40:40.405 --> 40:42.603
has a job, film clubs,

40:42.603 --> 40:44.908
likes to sip tea
with his friends,

40:44.909 --> 40:46.375
writes a poem
now and then,

40:46.376 --> 40:48.365
only has relations
with other gays,

40:48.365 --> 40:49.832
never takes a risk,

40:49.832 --> 40:52.032
and never gets
to know a real man.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.441
The third one,

40:54.441 --> 40:55.698
the closet gay,
okay,

40:55.803 --> 40:57.060
nobody knows
he is gay.

40:57.060 --> 40:59.469
He's married,
has children,

40:59.470 --> 41:01.564
hides on his way
to the bathroom,

41:01.565 --> 41:04.393
still wearing the ring
that his wife gave him.

41:04.393 --> 41:07.326
They're hard to spot,
but I've got one here.

41:11.307 --> 41:13.926
Most of the time they're
the ones who censor other gays.

41:22.306 --> 41:23.249
And fourth, the royal gay,

41:23.249 --> 41:25.030
a unique product
of our country,

41:25.030 --> 41:26.182
a communist country.

41:26.182 --> 41:30.791
Because of his closeness
to our Maximum Leader

41:30.792 --> 41:32.677
or special work with
the State Security,

41:32.677 --> 41:35.924
he can afford
to be openly gay,

41:35.924 --> 41:38.962
travel freely in this
country and abroad,

41:38.963 --> 41:41.686
cover himself
with jewels, clothes...

41:41.686 --> 41:45.667
Coño, he even has
a private chauffeur.

41:51.952 --> 41:54.990
Hey, hey.
Stop!

41:54.990 --> 41:56.666
Reinaldo!

41:56.667 --> 41:58.342
Hey, Reinaldo!

41:58.342 --> 42:01.066
Come on.
We'll give you a ride.

42:05.780 --> 42:07.770
Where are you going?

42:07.771 --> 42:08.713
Don't worry.
Take a seat.

42:10.180 --> 42:12.694
Hello.

42:12.695 --> 42:13.741
How are you?

42:18.560 --> 42:22.855
Now, we're going to take
a little shortcut

42:22.856 --> 42:25.160
and show you a beautiful
part of Havana

42:25.161 --> 42:27.779
that not many
visitors get to see.

43:49.593 --> 43:52.422
The crackdown began in earnest.

43:52.423 --> 43:55.460
The horror and ugliness
advanced day by day

43:55.460 --> 43:57.555
at an ever increasing pace,

43:57.555 --> 44:01.850
but the oppression only
acted as a stimulus

44:02.374 --> 44:04.783
and sex became a way
of fighting it...

44:04.783 --> 44:07.821
a weapon to use
against the regimen.

45:45.559 --> 45:47.025
Needless to say,

45:47.025 --> 45:49.749
the Revolution wasn't
for everybody.

45:49.750 --> 45:53.510
Mr. Heberto Zorrilla Ochoa,

45:53.510 --> 45:58.733
are you aware of Article 243
in the Penal Code?

45:58.734 --> 45:59.569
Yes.

46:00.300 --> 46:04.687
And what does Article 243
of the Penal Code state?

46:04.688 --> 46:09.075
It states that no assembly
of over three people is allowed.

46:09.076 --> 46:13.671
And yet, you had an assembly
of over 20 people at your home

46:13.672 --> 46:15.238
on the night of July 10th.

46:15.239 --> 46:17.118
What were you doing?

46:17.119 --> 46:19.312
It was a poetry reading.

46:19.313 --> 46:21.506
Whose poetry?

46:21.507 --> 46:24.431
My own--
others.

46:24.432 --> 46:28.087
And are you sure that
this was a poetry reading

46:28.087 --> 46:30.281
and not just an
opportunity to recite

46:30.282 --> 46:32.579
counterrevolutionary
propaganda?

46:33.310 --> 46:34.877
Yes, I'm sure.

46:34.877 --> 46:39.683
Mr. Correa, is poetry
ever propaganda?

46:40.727 --> 46:43.130
I suppose it could be.

46:43.131 --> 46:45.950
But not your poetry.

46:45.951 --> 46:48.040
No.

46:48.353 --> 46:52.323
Mr. Correa, who else
was present

46:52.323 --> 46:54.725
at this so-called
poetry reading?

46:56.606 --> 46:59.949
Some friends,
other writers.

46:59.950 --> 47:05.276
Tell me, does the name
José Lezama Lima ring a bell?

47:05.277 --> 47:07.574
Virgilio Piñera?

47:07.574 --> 47:09.873
Your wife, Fina?

47:10.604 --> 47:11.753
Yes.

47:11.857 --> 47:13.215
Were they there?

47:13.216 --> 47:15.305
Yes, they were there.

47:15.306 --> 47:18.752
Are you aware
that Lezama Lima

47:18.753 --> 47:21.677
and Virgilio Piñera
are homosexuals?

47:22.617 --> 47:24.289
Yes.

47:35.571 --> 47:37.869
I am aware of my errors.

47:42.152 --> 47:44.137
that are unpardonable,

47:45.286 --> 47:48.420
errors that demand
to be severely punished.

47:49.987 --> 47:53.434
But I must confess
that I see before me

47:53.435 --> 47:55.105
in this room,

47:55.210 --> 47:58.866
the faces of many comrades
who like me,

47:58.867 --> 48:01.060
have lost their way,

48:01.061 --> 48:04.925
whose ideology has waivered,

48:04.926 --> 48:07.745
who have committed
similar errors...

48:07.746 --> 48:15.998
errors that also demand
to be severely punished.

49:05.618 --> 49:08.334
I'm sorry.
I'm late.

49:08.648 --> 49:11.155
We got a call about
an hour ago.

49:11.156 --> 49:13.244
They said they would be
at the Hotel Nacional

49:13.245 --> 49:15.542
and they're leaving
today at 4:00 p. m.

49:15.543 --> 49:17.109
That's all they said?

49:17.109 --> 49:19.303
They're friends of
Lezama Lima.

49:20.452 --> 49:23.064
- Reinaldo?
- Yes.

49:23.065 --> 49:24.631
I'm Jorge Camacho.

49:24.631 --> 49:27.760
- This is my wife, Margarita.
- Hi.

49:27.762 --> 49:29.012
Have a seat.

49:31.621 --> 49:33.081
We live in Paris.

49:33.082 --> 49:35.272
Jorge is in a show
at the Salón De Mayo.

49:35.272 --> 49:36.524
He's a painter.

49:36.628 --> 49:38.506
We are big fans
of your work.

49:38.507 --> 49:40.280
My work?

49:40.280 --> 49:42.471
We bought your book
in a bookstore

49:42.472 --> 49:44.766
and Jorge stayed up
all night reading it.

49:44.766 --> 49:46.853
He said it was
the greatest novel

49:46.853 --> 49:48.313
he ever read
about childhood.

49:49.252 --> 49:51.547
Would you put
the book away, please.

49:51.547 --> 49:53.008
Yes, of course.

49:57.807 --> 49:59.163
Of course.

52:28.771 --> 52:30.023
Reinaldo!

52:32.423 --> 52:33.987
Margarita went ahead.

52:33.989 --> 52:35.031
I thought you
were gone.

52:35.031 --> 52:36.804
I went to the hotel--
I didn't know.

52:36.805 --> 52:38.995
But, I knew you
were here.

52:43.064 --> 52:45.046
This is a friend
of ours,

52:45.046 --> 52:47.550
who works at
the French Embassy.

52:47.551 --> 52:49.219
If you ever
need anything

52:49.221 --> 52:50.889
you can give
her a call.

52:50.890 --> 52:53.914
She'll get in
touch with us.

52:53.915 --> 52:56.418
It's a small present
from Margarita and me.

52:56.836 --> 52:58.713
Thank you
very much, Jorge.

52:58.714 --> 53:00.591
You have to go.

53:00.591 --> 53:01.843
What do your
paintings look like?

53:01.948 --> 53:03.930
Because I didn't
ask you before.

53:03.931 --> 53:06.225
You'll have to
see them in person.

53:06.226 --> 53:06.851
Sure.

53:06.955 --> 53:08.207
Who knows?

53:08.208 --> 53:10.294
Maybe you could
write something

53:10.295 --> 53:11.755
about them someday.

53:50.774 --> 53:54.425
Hey Mister,
can I have my kite, please?

53:54.426 --> 53:55.364
Get lost.

53:55.468 --> 53:56.825
You almost killed me.

53:56.825 --> 53:59.016
Come on,
give him the kite.

53:59.017 --> 54:01.206
You want to give
him the kite?

54:01.207 --> 54:02.250
Give him the kite?

54:02.250 --> 54:03.293
Forget it!

54:05.797 --> 54:07.779
Come on,
give him the kite!

54:07.779 --> 54:09.240
Oye!

54:09.240 --> 54:10.596
You want to give
him back the kite?

54:10.596 --> 54:12.265
Okay, I'll give
him the kite.

54:14.352 --> 54:15.708
What are you doing, Pepe?

54:20.090 --> 54:22.072
What are you doing, Pepe?

54:22.698 --> 54:24.263
Get out of here!

54:38.765 --> 54:41.686
Aléjate de aquí!
iBruto!

54:48.676 --> 54:50.345
Here.

55:00.257 --> 55:01.404
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

55:01.405 --> 55:03.699
I was on the beach
and these boys

55:03.700 --> 55:07.142
stole my flippers
and my clothes.

55:07.143 --> 55:08.916
Could you identify them?

55:08.917 --> 55:11.941
No, but it's okay.

55:11.942 --> 55:14.028
Get in the car.

55:14.967 --> 55:16.428
No, it's okay.

55:16.428 --> 55:18.931
Get in the car.

55:25.191 --> 55:27.069
Ahí están!
That's them!

55:32.911 --> 55:34.685
Come over here.

55:36.041 --> 55:38.650
You have something
belonging to this man?

55:38.963 --> 55:40.110
Look at him.

55:43.031 --> 55:45.327
Give me your ID cards.

55:54.508 --> 55:57.533
I was going to return this
stuff to the police station.

55:57.534 --> 56:00.663
That faggot and his friend,
tried to touch our pricks.

56:00.663 --> 56:02.332
Yeah, we beat them up
and they ran off,

56:02.333 --> 56:04.627
so, we were going to bring
this to the station.

56:04.627 --> 56:05.984
They molested us.

56:06.088 --> 56:07.653
- They molested you?
- Yeah.

56:07.654 --> 56:09.322
- You're sure?
- Yes.

56:10.261 --> 56:11.722
You're under arrest.

56:11.722 --> 56:12.765
Why!

56:12.869 --> 56:15.165
Because I said so.

56:25.598 --> 56:26.954
Lugando Barnes!

58:38.617 --> 58:40.077
What are you doing here?

58:40.182 --> 58:41.642
I live right over here.

58:41.643 --> 58:44.564
I need a towel, t-shirt,
anything you have.

58:44.564 --> 58:45.711
Please.

58:47.172 --> 58:47.902
Thank you.

58:47.902 --> 58:49.050
I need a place to hide.

58:49.050 --> 58:51.241
I don't know,
I have to get out of here.

58:51.242 --> 58:52.597
Why, what did you do?

58:52.701 --> 58:54.683
They said I
molested these kids.

58:54.685 --> 58:56.874
You should see these kids.

58:56.874 --> 58:58.439
They were all bigger
than me.

58:58.439 --> 58:59.900
Have you heard from Tomás?

58:59.900 --> 59:03.447
I was told that he was
in a work camp in Oriente

59:03.448 --> 59:05.847
and he was killed
while trying to escape.

59:05.848 --> 59:06.681
I've heard you've
had some trouble

59:06.681 --> 59:07.829
with the police.

59:07.829 --> 59:09.185
No, it was a mistake,

59:09.185 --> 59:11.480
they had me mixed up
with somebody else.

59:12.837 --> 59:15.654
The way I see it,
you have two choices:

59:15.654 --> 59:19.931
You can try to make it
to the U. S. Navy Base

59:19.932 --> 59:20.974
in Guantánamo;

59:20.974 --> 59:23.165
or you can try to float
your way to Florida.

59:23.166 --> 59:25.669
It's about 90 miles.

59:25.669 --> 59:28.903
You can make it in a few
days if the current is good.

59:28.903 --> 59:31.512
I have an inner tube
I was saving.

59:31.512 --> 59:33.076
It's yours.

01:00:06.879 --> 01:00:08.235
Who is it?

01:00:08.236 --> 01:00:09.487
It's me, Pepe.

01:00:09.592 --> 01:00:11.052
I'm sorry about today.

01:00:13.347 --> 01:00:14.704
What do you want now?

01:00:14.704 --> 01:00:15.747
Where are you going?

01:00:15.748 --> 01:00:17.834
I don't know.

01:00:17.835 --> 01:00:19.086
H uh, where have you been?

01:00:19.086 --> 01:00:20.024
I'm leaving right now.

01:00:21.172 --> 01:00:22.007
How?

01:00:22.424 --> 01:00:23.780
How?
Inner tube.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.137
You're crazy,
you're going to drown.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:27.953
Listen, do you want
to help me?

01:00:27.955 --> 01:00:29.310
Yes, I want to help you.

01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:31.396
Then give me all the
money you have on you.

01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:35.987
You can have
the gold, clothes...

01:00:35.988 --> 01:00:37.343
you can sell
it everywhere.

01:00:37.344 --> 01:00:39.325
Please, give me all
the money you have on you.

01:00:39.325 --> 01:00:40.369
You have money in here?

01:00:40.369 --> 01:00:42.977
Give me the money.
Give me the money!

01:00:42.978 --> 01:00:43.603
You can take--

01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:44.750
you can take everything,

01:00:44.751 --> 01:00:45.898
You can stay here
if you want.

01:00:46.002 --> 01:00:50.071
Reinaldo, I have
some friends

01:00:50.072 --> 01:00:50.906
that can solve
this problem.

01:00:50.906 --> 01:00:52.053
What kind of friends
do you have?

01:00:52.053 --> 01:00:53.618
You know what
kind of friends.

01:00:53.618 --> 01:00:55.183
Why kind of friends
do you have?

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:56.018
Don't go away.

01:00:56.122 --> 01:00:58.417
- Reinaldo.
- I'm leaving.

01:00:58.417 --> 01:00:59.669
I'm leaving...

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:01.234
I-I'll keep in touch
with you, alright?

01:01:01.235 --> 01:01:02.278
Bye.

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.186
Reinaldo--

01:04:53.053 --> 01:04:55.035
I have to hide
you somewhere,

01:04:55.036 --> 01:04:57.018
because we are
surrounded by police.

01:05:32.907 --> 01:05:34.680
... a photo of you

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:36.663
just in case you forget
what you look like,

01:05:38.019 --> 01:05:40.418
and last,
"La lliada. "

01:05:40.419 --> 01:05:41.879
"La llíada, " Juan,
"La llíada. "

01:05:43.757 --> 01:05:45.322
Here are the pills
you asked for.

01:05:45.322 --> 01:05:46.365
What are they?

01:05:46.365 --> 01:05:49.912
I don't know,
but they make you happy.

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:52.312
Will they kill me?

01:05:52.313 --> 01:05:54.398
I suppose if you
took enough of them.

01:06:44.685 --> 01:06:45.311
Hello.

01:06:45.311 --> 01:06:45.937
Hello.

01:06:45.937 --> 01:06:48.128
Can I have two
croquetas, please?

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:49.067
Two?

01:06:49.067 --> 01:06:50.319
Yes, and a drink.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.920
Do you have a light?

01:07:31.633 --> 01:07:33.719
Yes.
Sure.

01:07:35.076 --> 01:07:36.849
Do you have
a cigarette?

01:07:46.761 --> 01:07:48.221
What is your name?

01:07:49.056 --> 01:07:51.351
Adriano Faustino Sotolongo.

01:07:53.646 --> 01:07:55.733
When did you get
that name, Reinaldo?

01:07:55.734 --> 01:07:58.341
You are Reinaldo Arenas,
aren't you?

01:08:08.252 --> 01:08:09.713
Buen trabajo.

01:08:11.904 --> 01:08:13.677
Officer: Mira, encontramos
este paquete.

01:08:50.296 --> 01:08:51.950
Este es Reinaldo Arenas,

01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:54.015
un pájaro que agarramos
ahí en el parque.

01:08:57.631 --> 01:09:00.006
Dale! Dale!

01:09:00.006 --> 01:09:02.073
Dale, coño!
Dale!

01:09:03.002 --> 01:09:04.863
Ya vas a ver
lo que es bueno.

01:09:04.863 --> 01:09:07.238
Vas a ver lo que es bueno
ahí adentro.

01:09:23.767 --> 01:09:27.383
I arrived at El Morro not
as a political prisoner

01:09:27.383 --> 01:09:28.519
or writer,

01:09:28.519 --> 01:09:32.548
but with an infamous
reputation as a rapist,

01:09:32.549 --> 01:09:35.234
a murderer,
and a CIA agent.

01:09:41.122 --> 01:09:43.188
a supernatural air
of nonchalance

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:46.287
and gave me an aura
of danger and respectability

01:09:46.287 --> 01:09:48.767
among the real murderers,

01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:50.316
real rapists,

01:09:50.317 --> 01:09:52.589
and common criminals
who would kill each other

01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:53.828
for the slightest reason.

01:10:13.766 --> 01:10:16.969
Skies lit by bolts
of lightning

01:10:16.969 --> 01:10:19.138
were replaced
by electric lights

01:10:19.139 --> 01:10:21.824
that blinked on and off
with regularity,

01:10:21.824 --> 01:10:25.130
killing the possibility
or chance that I might dream

01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:26.782
or forget where I was.

01:10:28.642 --> 01:10:30.811
I thought here
I could go unnoticed.

01:10:30.811 --> 01:10:34.633
But prisoners are those
beings that know everything,

01:10:34.633 --> 01:10:37.009
especially about
other prisoners.

01:10:48.373 --> 01:10:51.162
Soon they knew,
maybe from the guards,

01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:54.468
or the warden himself,
or a killer named Torre,

01:10:54.468 --> 01:10:56.017
that I was a writer.

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:59.943
Say, you think you could
write a letter for me?

01:10:59.944 --> 01:11:00.976
What?

01:11:01.079 --> 01:11:02.216
Not for nothing,

01:11:03.352 --> 01:11:05.315
I give you two cigarettes.

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:07.071
Carlota--

01:11:07.072 --> 01:11:11.513
tell her that I miss
her so much.

01:11:11.514 --> 01:11:13.062
Your words or mine?

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:17.918
I'm sorry.

01:11:28.455 --> 01:11:31.967
My fame as "The Writer"
spread all over the prison.

01:11:33.103 --> 01:11:34.240
María...

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.959
From the 17 cells of El Morro,

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.748
and for those who couldn't
see me directly,

01:11:40.748 --> 01:11:44.260
petitions came in the form
of hundreds of balls of soap,

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:46.016
tied to long strings,

01:11:46.017 --> 01:11:48.805
that the prisoners
could pass on to my cell.

01:11:49.529 --> 01:11:51.285
It was called "The Mail. "

01:11:52.524 --> 01:11:54.384
I never wrote so much.

01:11:55.727 --> 01:11:59.032
I accumulated a small
fortune of cigarettes

01:11:59.032 --> 01:12:02.132
that provided me with
enough paper and pencils

01:12:02.133 --> 01:12:03.475
for my own novel,

01:12:03.578 --> 01:12:05.127
which I wrote in the middle,

01:12:05.127 --> 01:12:07.917
of all the screaming
and crying.

01:12:07.918 --> 01:12:11.739
Cubans are defined by noise,
it's their nature.

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.908
They need to bother others.

01:12:13.909 --> 01:12:17.214
They can neither enjoy,
nor suffer in silence.

01:12:22.276 --> 01:12:24.342
Even the sun was rationed,

01:12:24.343 --> 01:12:26.924
but once a month
the gay inmates

01:12:26.925 --> 01:12:29.094
turned El Morro
into a nightclub.

01:12:30.230 --> 01:12:32.400
Leonardo da Vinci
was homosexual,

01:12:32.401 --> 01:12:37.255
so was Michelangelo,
Socrates, Shakespeare,

01:12:37.256 --> 01:12:39.321
and almost every other
figure that has formed

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:41.903
what we have come
to understand as beauty.

01:12:41.903 --> 01:12:45.622
Bon Bon, the hearthrob
of El Morro,

01:12:45.623 --> 01:12:47.379
was no different.

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:50.478
She was so glamorous,
that when she walked by,

01:12:50.478 --> 01:12:53.577
she made everybody feel
like they were in the movies.

01:12:55.643 --> 01:12:58.639
Bon Bon was also famous
for another quality.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.428
He was one
of those transporters,

01:13:01.429 --> 01:13:03.700
who by the grace
of countless activity,

01:13:03.702 --> 01:13:06.696
could carry unfathomable
quantities in the deepness

01:13:06.697 --> 01:13:11.448
of his rectum, even if given
a thorough ass check.

01:13:28.287 --> 01:13:29.216
Excuse me,

01:13:30.663 --> 01:13:33.245
I heard that you can get
things in and out of here.

01:13:35.725 --> 01:13:38.824
Could you carry
a package for me?

01:13:38.825 --> 01:13:40.167
Of course,
he denied it.

01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:45.229
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:13:51.117 --> 01:13:53.803
But every ass
has his price.

01:13:55.352 --> 01:13:57.961
It took me a thousand
cigarettes and Bon Bon

01:13:57.962 --> 01:14:02.030
five trips to smuggle my novel
to the other side of El Morro.

01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:25.503
Por favor!

01:15:26.442 --> 01:15:29.677
- Por favor, no me metan ahí!
- Camina!

01:15:29.678 --> 01:15:33.224
Por favor!
¿Por qué?

01:15:33.225 --> 01:15:35.103
Si no le he hecho
nada a nadie, hombre!

01:15:35.207 --> 01:15:36.772
Por favor!

01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:38.650
Abran la puerta!

01:15:38.651 --> 01:15:40.528
Abran la puerta, por Dios!
No me entren aquí!

01:15:40.529 --> 01:15:41.676
Abran la puerta!

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.397
¿Por qué me hacen esto?

01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:56.701
Está bien...
está bien.

01:16:04.527 --> 01:16:06.196
Por Dios!

01:16:06.197 --> 01:16:07.866
Abran la puerta, por Dios!

01:16:07.866 --> 01:16:09.848
Abran la puerta!

01:16:43.133 --> 01:16:45.533
Espera, por Dios, espera!

01:16:50.228 --> 01:16:54.297
I felt an indescribable
sadness to see my mother

01:16:54.299 --> 01:16:57.636
with that white shirt,
demanding that I come home

01:16:57.637 --> 01:17:00.975
and telling me that
I had no other choice.

01:17:00.976 --> 01:17:02.645
I gathered all
the strength I had.

01:17:02.646 --> 01:17:03.897
After two years
of prison,

01:17:04.001 --> 01:17:06.297
you think my only choice
is to go home with you?!

01:17:07.444 --> 01:17:09.740
I turned my back on my mother
and ran away.

01:17:14.644 --> 01:17:18.296
I will always remember
her standing there like that.

01:17:18.297 --> 01:17:21.009
I wanted to go back
and hug her.

01:17:21.635 --> 01:17:23.304
But instead,

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:27.791
I ran towards these gigantic
black men playing volleyball.

01:17:45.112 --> 01:17:47.198
... también me despertará.

01:17:47.199 --> 01:17:51.059
A mí me despertará
de este sueño,

01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:54.398
que también es pesadilla,

01:17:54.399 --> 01:17:56.172
que también es pesadilla...

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:26.431
Vamos, afuera!

01:18:33.109 --> 01:18:38.639
The truth is that there
is no possibility

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.978
of rehabilitating a faggot.

01:18:45.212 --> 01:18:47.925
How many times have
we confiscated this...

01:18:47.926 --> 01:18:50.429
counterrevolutionary poop?

01:18:52.203 --> 01:18:54.394
Don't you realize...

01:18:54.395 --> 01:18:56.585
that this can cost
you your life?

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:01.281
We can make
you disappear,

01:19:01.907 --> 01:19:04.828
or you could
be free tomorrow.

01:19:04.829 --> 01:19:07.124
It's up to you.

01:19:07.959 --> 01:19:11.089
But, if you keep
writing this,

01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:14.428
you're not going
to get very far.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.062
I'm going to give you five
minutes to make up your mind.

01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:30.496
It might take a queer
more than five minutes

01:19:30.497 --> 01:19:32.896
to make up his mind
while watching this handsome

01:19:32.897 --> 01:19:35.818
lieutenant stroke his
magnificent organ.

01:19:46.565 --> 01:19:48.652
What do you say?

01:19:51.051 --> 01:19:53.243
Can I have some
paper and a pen?

01:20:11.711 --> 01:20:21.519
All the work I've done
until now is garbage.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:24.232
I quickly accused myself
of being a villain,

01:20:24.233 --> 01:20:27.780
a traitor, a depraved
counter revolutionary,

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.701
and while fixating on his
generous projectile,

01:20:30.702 --> 01:20:33.205
I thanked the government
for the largeness,

01:20:33.206 --> 01:20:35.709
and about the grandness
of Lt. Victor.

01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:42.283
I deny my homosexual condition.

01:20:44.057 --> 01:20:48.856
And I am converted into a man
illuminated by this Revolution.

01:20:54.595 --> 01:20:56.160
Good.

01:20:56.995 --> 01:20:58.873
Very good.

01:21:05.655 --> 01:21:08.160
This is how a man behaves.

01:21:09.829 --> 01:21:13.481
I almost fainted when I felt
his member near my face.

01:21:13.898 --> 01:21:16.924
Your five minutes is up.

01:21:21.515 --> 01:21:23.811
You got a lot
of publicity,

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:26.315
but friends,

01:21:26.316 --> 01:21:29.549
where are they now?

01:21:29.549 --> 01:21:34.245
Pepe Malas is your friend?

01:21:34.246 --> 01:21:36.123
He's someone you can trust?

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.027
Why isn't he here with you?

01:21:52.296 --> 01:21:55.009
You recognize this
book, Reinaldo?

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:58.869
That book was the only
proof to me that I was alive.

01:21:58.870 --> 01:22:01.374
No.
I've never seen it.

01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:09.095
This book was
published in France

01:22:09.096 --> 01:22:13.581
without permission
of the Writer's Union.

01:22:13.583 --> 01:22:19.216
Therefore, you must have had
someone to smuggle it out.

01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:23.285
You didn't go
to France did you?

01:22:24.016 --> 01:22:25.894
Maybe I should be
discussing this book

01:22:25.998 --> 01:22:29.233
with the Writer's Union
and not here in State Security.

01:22:33.093 --> 01:22:34.971
Abre la boca.

01:22:41.858 --> 01:22:43.945
La boca...

01:22:43.945 --> 01:22:45.092
La boca!!

01:22:48.223 --> 01:22:50.101
Así...

01:22:50.101 --> 01:22:51.875
Así, Reinaldo...

01:23:23.386 --> 01:23:27.664
I will close my eyes now
and you will be gone.

01:23:33.194 --> 01:23:35.281
You're gone.

01:23:37.993 --> 01:23:41.750
The revolution will find
a way to use your talent.

01:23:41.751 --> 01:23:44.463
We could fit you in somewhere,

01:23:44.464 --> 01:23:49.054
some speeches, a letter
to your friends, publisher,

01:23:49.055 --> 01:23:53.749
telling them how well
you're being treated

01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:55.210
and that's a good beginning.

01:24:05.957 --> 01:24:08.461
You thought it was me
who turned you in.

01:24:08.462 --> 01:24:10.131
I thought it was...

01:24:10.131 --> 01:24:12.217
Pepe.

01:24:13.261 --> 01:24:14.930
Can you really
blame him?

01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:16.600
Yes, I can.

01:24:16.704 --> 01:24:23.278
And, I will blame him
for the rest of my life.

01:24:23.279 --> 01:24:24.947
Look at this.

01:24:36.842 --> 01:24:41.433
This book...

01:24:41.434 --> 01:24:44.667
won best foreign
novel in France...

01:24:47.172 --> 01:24:50.198
and I don't even have
a place to live.

01:24:55.728 --> 01:24:57.606
What am I going to do?

01:24:59.797 --> 01:25:02.405
What are you
going to do?

01:25:02.407 --> 01:25:03.866
You're in luck.

01:25:03.866 --> 01:25:05.953
I'm in luck?

01:25:05.953 --> 01:25:09.083
Remember Blanca Romero,
the painter?

01:25:09.084 --> 01:25:12.735
She lives in the Hotel Clarita,

01:25:12.735 --> 01:25:15.761
next to the convent
of Santa Clara.

01:25:19.309 --> 01:25:23.274
Hey, Blanca wanted
a window.

01:25:27.865 --> 01:25:29.847
We thought it went
to the street.

01:25:37.464 --> 01:25:40.073
We're selling this stuff
on the black market.

01:25:40.074 --> 01:25:42.890
So, this is the surprise.

01:25:43.933 --> 01:25:46.542
Something else...

01:25:46.543 --> 01:25:50.194
making a fortune.

01:25:50.195 --> 01:25:52.385
We got a hold
of these parachutes

01:25:52.386 --> 01:25:54.263
and we're going
to sail them to Miami.

01:25:54.263 --> 01:25:55.828
You're kidding, right?

01:25:55.829 --> 01:25:57.185
No, I'm not kidding.

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:58.437
This is my friend, Armando

01:25:58.437 --> 01:25:59.480
He's an expert with
the blowtorch.

01:25:59.481 --> 01:26:00.524
He can fix anything,

01:26:00.628 --> 01:26:02.610
even steal electricity
from the street.

01:26:02.611 --> 01:26:03.758
He's an engineer.

01:26:03.862 --> 01:26:08.140
I knew him in jail.

01:26:08.141 --> 01:26:10.540
We figure that the balloon
will take three passengers.

01:26:10.541 --> 01:26:13.357
So, we are going to draw
lots to see who goes.

01:26:13.359 --> 01:26:14.610
I'm definitely going.

01:26:14.611 --> 01:26:15.966
Blanca's definitely going.

01:26:15.966 --> 01:26:17.844
Tú no vas a estar
haciendo dieta ahora.

01:26:20.661 --> 01:26:22.853
The rest of us
will draw lots.

01:26:24.522 --> 01:26:26.504
We need some help,
there's only six of us.

01:26:26.504 --> 01:26:28.383
I can help.

01:26:49.042 --> 01:26:51.122
- Who's the guy?
- Reinaldo.

01:26:51.746 --> 01:26:53.514
Someone is here.

01:26:54.451 --> 01:26:55.907
Someone is here.

01:27:42.293 --> 01:27:43.853
She's such a bitch.

01:27:45.413 --> 01:27:47.805
She hates me just
like my mother.

01:27:50.717 --> 01:27:52.901
Why do you think
your mother hates you?

01:27:52.902 --> 01:27:57.997
She put me in an asylum
so she didn't have to feed me.

01:27:58.517 --> 01:27:59.557
What?

01:28:00.597 --> 01:28:03.718
She put me in Mazorra so she
wouldn't have to feed me.

01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:13.702
Her own son.

01:28:20.774 --> 01:28:22.646
She's just like her.

01:28:27.743 --> 01:28:30.551
You can sleep here
anytime you want.

01:28:30.552 --> 01:28:33.879
Just friends, okay,
just friends.

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:36.999
A pillow, you have
a blanket...

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.847
and I don't have anything
to offer you...

01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:43.239
but a book...

01:28:43.239 --> 01:28:45.007
that you asked me for
a long time ago,

01:28:45.009 --> 01:28:46.464
you remember that?

01:28:51.352 --> 01:28:54.368
It's your--
It's your book?

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.800
Yes, it's my book,
now it's yours.

01:29:00.608 --> 01:29:01.752
Thanks.

01:29:31.810 --> 01:29:33.682
Why do you write?

01:29:37.322 --> 01:29:39.506
Revenge.

01:29:46.994 --> 01:29:49.386
Could you teach me
how to write?

01:29:49.387 --> 01:29:53.859
I don't know, Lázaro.
I don't know.

01:30:01.867 --> 01:30:04.675
I want to die
at the end of the day,

01:30:04.676 --> 01:30:06.755
in the high seas,

01:30:06.756 --> 01:30:09.355
with my face
towards the sky

01:30:09.356 --> 01:30:13.203
when it seems like
agony is just a dream

01:30:13.204 --> 01:30:17.780
and the soul, a bird
ascending in flight.

01:30:17.781 --> 01:30:19.964
Who is that?

01:30:19.965 --> 01:30:23.084
Manuel Guitérrez Nájera.
Mexicano.

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:38.685
I mean, you're a writer
even if you don't write.

01:30:38.686 --> 01:30:39.933
You know what I mean?

01:30:39.933 --> 01:30:41.077
Yeah, I know what
you mean.

01:30:41.077 --> 01:30:42.741
- Hey.
- Hola. ¿Cómo están?

01:30:48.253 --> 01:30:49.709
You know what I mean?

01:30:51.581 --> 01:30:53.349
iCoño!
Pero mira...

01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:06.142
... and if you need
anything else,

01:31:06.143 --> 01:31:08.846
just let me know.
I can find it for you.

01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:21.118
What is this pig
doing here?

01:31:21.118 --> 01:31:25.071
He's the one who
got the propane.

01:31:25.072 --> 01:31:27.151
Grab his leg,
come on.

01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:32.996
Psst, psst!

01:33:43.813 --> 01:33:45.893
Oh, no, no, no.

01:33:45.894 --> 01:33:47.869
If you let me out
of here,

01:33:47.869 --> 01:33:49.845
it's yours.

01:34:00.558 --> 01:34:01.806
Untie the ropes,

01:34:01.806 --> 01:34:04.510
and I'll bring you
to Miami with me.

01:34:24.687 --> 01:34:30.823
Come! Come!
Despierten!

01:34:32.591 --> 01:34:34.983
El globo se va!
Baja!

01:34:38.103 --> 01:34:42.159
See you in Times Square,
faggots!

01:37:16.502 --> 01:37:20.662
Lázaro, take this, sell it
and try to get me some lemons,

01:37:22.327 --> 01:37:24.615
and tea...

01:37:26.591 --> 01:37:28.255
and some paper, please.

01:37:28.255 --> 01:37:29.607
Sure.

01:37:33.143 --> 01:37:34.911
That's all you need?

01:37:34.912 --> 01:37:36.887
Yes, and whatever you want.

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:48.952
- Have you seen Lázaro?
- No.

01:37:48.952 --> 01:37:50.824
He hasn't come home
in two weeks.

01:37:50.824 --> 01:37:52.384
He's probably in the
Peruvian Embassy.

01:37:52.384 --> 01:37:54.256
You heard about the bus
crashing through the gate?

01:37:54.257 --> 01:37:55.920
Yes, of course I've
heard about that.

01:37:55.921 --> 01:37:59.664
Fidel said that anybody
who wants to leave can.

01:37:59.664 --> 01:38:01.536
There's 10,000 people there.

01:38:01.536 --> 01:38:03.096
Now, he's mixing
the dissidents

01:38:03.096 --> 01:38:05.904
with the criminals,
homosexuals, and mentally ill.

01:38:05.904 --> 01:38:07.257
That's a great idea.

01:38:07.258 --> 01:38:09.857
All you have to do is go
to the local police station

01:38:09.857 --> 01:38:11.001
for your exit permit.

01:38:11.105 --> 01:38:13.185
You tell them that you
have a criminal record

01:38:13.185 --> 01:38:14.537
or that you're a homosexual,

01:38:14.537 --> 01:38:16.513
or that you're mentally ill.

01:38:16.513 --> 01:38:17.761
I don't believe that.

01:38:17.762 --> 01:38:18.593
It's a trap.

01:38:18.593 --> 01:38:20.049
Maybe.

01:38:30.762 --> 01:38:32.114
Next.

01:38:37.730 --> 01:38:38.666
What's your name?

01:38:38.667 --> 01:38:40.330
Reinaldo Arenas.

01:38:40.434 --> 01:38:43.554
State your reason
for wanting to leave.

01:38:43.555 --> 01:38:46.362
I am homosexual.

01:38:47.298 --> 01:38:49.690
Where do you go
to pick up men.

01:38:54.059 --> 01:38:56.776
En la parada del Hotel Plaza,
en "El Prado, " en "La Sortija. "

01:38:57.612 --> 01:38:59.597
What position do
you like in bed?

01:39:03.150 --> 01:39:06.076
I like it from behind,
and on my knees.

01:39:06.703 --> 01:39:07.957
Walk!

01:39:15.794 --> 01:39:17.048
- Walk! Walk!
- Walk.

01:39:26.662 --> 01:39:28.856
Report to Abreu Fontan.

01:40:10.759 --> 01:40:12.222
What are they doing?

01:40:12.326 --> 01:40:14.312
They got a list
of everyone

01:40:14.313 --> 01:40:15.775
they don't want
to let out.

01:40:19.536 --> 01:40:20.581
Like who?

01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:21.731
I don't know.

01:40:25.702 --> 01:40:28.523
- Do you have a pen?
- No.

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:33.434
- Do you have a pen?
- No, sir.

01:40:55.796 --> 01:40:57.573
Avancen, avancen,
avancen!

01:43:51.245 --> 01:43:53.126
I don't care where I sleep.

01:43:53.127 --> 01:43:57.410
Just promise me you won't
bring any of your friends here.

01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:59.187
I can cook.
It's no problem.

01:43:59.188 --> 01:44:00.963
How much is it?

01:44:00.964 --> 01:44:03.366
$350 per month,
plus utilities.

01:44:03.367 --> 01:44:05.143
The difference between
the communist system,

01:44:05.143 --> 01:44:06.501
and the capitalist system,

01:44:06.502 --> 01:44:09.218
is that when they give
you a kick in the ass

01:44:09.218 --> 01:44:11.935
in the communist system,
you have to applaud;

01:44:11.936 --> 01:44:14.652
in the capitalist system,
you can scream.

01:46:30.601 --> 01:46:34.990
- Hello, Mr. Greenberg.
- Thanks.

01:46:34.991 --> 01:46:35.930
Happy holiday.

01:46:35.931 --> 01:46:38.229
Thank you.
Here let me help you.

01:46:52.127 --> 01:46:54.739
The doorman...

01:46:54.741 --> 01:46:57.247
Hey, let's go.
I've got a break.

01:46:58.083 --> 01:47:00.800
You're writing a novel!

01:47:44.479 --> 01:47:46.047
Laz.

01:48:44.147 --> 01:48:45.923
What happened?

01:48:45.923 --> 01:48:48.953
- Oh, I broke a glass.
- Hey, you're bleeding.

01:48:48.954 --> 01:48:50.416
Leave it alone.
Laz! Laz!

01:48:50.834 --> 01:48:52.193
I'm trying to help.

01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:57.000
What's the matter, Rey?

01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:03.792
You are like a milk cow
that gives milk

01:49:03.793 --> 01:49:06.195
all the time and then
kicks over the bucket.

01:49:10.166 --> 01:49:12.151
There's the door, doorman.

01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:18.944
Walk through it.
Walk through it.

01:49:18.944 --> 01:49:20.093
I don't want to
see you again.

01:49:20.093 --> 01:49:21.974
I'm tired of living
with a moron.

01:49:21.974 --> 01:49:24.482
You are a moron, Laz.

01:49:24.483 --> 01:49:26.781
Please, leave the keys
on the table.

01:50:09.833 --> 01:50:13.908
The moon bathes Death
in a light

01:50:13.909 --> 01:50:16.834
that makes him look
like a white star

01:50:16.835 --> 01:50:20.387
twinkling in the middle
of the backyard.

01:50:24.672 --> 01:50:26.866
That used to be my bicycle.

01:50:52.258 --> 01:50:53.512
Rey!

01:50:54.766 --> 01:50:56.020
Open the door!

01:51:00.305 --> 01:51:01.663
Rey!

01:51:16.188 --> 01:51:17.964
Reinaldo.
Hey, Reinaldo.

01:51:18.487 --> 01:51:20.472
How ya doing?
Come on, get up.

01:51:20.577 --> 01:51:21.308
It's time to go.

01:51:21.309 --> 01:51:23.294
Where?

01:51:23.294 --> 01:51:24.757
It's time to go home.

01:51:24.758 --> 01:51:26.220
Cuba?

01:51:26.221 --> 01:51:29.250
No, I think you should go
to your apartment first.

01:51:29.250 --> 01:51:31.131
Come on, I'll give
you a hand.

01:51:32.803 --> 01:51:34.266
Here we go.

01:51:37.819 --> 01:51:39.490
Are these your
things here?

01:51:39.492 --> 01:51:42.730
How are you feeling?
You feeling alright?

01:51:45.342 --> 01:51:47.223
I can't believe they're
sending you home.

01:51:52.134 --> 01:51:54.329
Do you have any insurance?

01:51:54.330 --> 01:51:56.732
- Yes, I do.
- I don't.

01:51:57.150 --> 01:51:59.867
- Don't forget the plant.
- I won't.

01:57:04.995 --> 01:57:06.980
Hello.

01:57:07.085 --> 01:57:08.652
You got everything?

01:57:08.652 --> 01:57:10.533
Yes.

01:57:10.533 --> 01:57:13.041
Give me a glass...

01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:17.325
and a straw.

01:57:33.731 --> 01:57:35.299
Where is the straw?

01:57:35.299 --> 01:57:38.016
- What?
- Where is the straw?

01:57:38.016 --> 01:57:39.687
The straw, yeah.

01:57:54.003 --> 01:57:55.675
You do it.

01:58:16.888 --> 01:58:19.709
Laz...

01:58:19.710 --> 01:58:23.471
I have something
to show you.

01:58:23.472 --> 01:58:25.979
Look.

01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:34.548
Here's "The Doorman. "

01:58:43.534 --> 01:58:46.042
"For Lazaro, his novel. "

01:58:48.968 --> 01:58:50.536
It just came out.

01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:52.835
You can have
all the money.

01:58:52.836 --> 01:58:53.775
The money?

01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:58.164
It's my book, Rey,

01:58:58.164 --> 01:59:00.776
you took it and now
you're going to insult me

01:59:00.776 --> 01:59:02.135
by paying me for it?

01:59:08.718 --> 01:59:12.062
Okay, sorry.
Thanks.

01:59:12.063 --> 01:59:14.674
- Don't say nothing.
- Okay.

01:59:16.346 --> 01:59:19.794
Give me a glass
with a...

01:59:49.367 --> 01:59:53.547
This bag
is important, Laz.

01:59:53.548 --> 01:59:54.696
You can take it.

01:59:54.696 --> 01:59:57.099
You're going to need
it more than me.

01:59:57.100 --> 01:59:58.667
Take it.

02:00:00.966 --> 02:00:04.101
I want you to promise
me something, Lázaro.

02:00:09.325 --> 02:00:12.669
I don't want to wake up
in the hospital.

02:00:13.714 --> 02:00:14.968
Promise me.

02:00:17.163 --> 02:00:19.253
I promise.

02:00:20.715 --> 02:00:23.746
Sure?

02:00:23.747 --> 02:00:24.791
Yeah.

02:00:27.612 --> 02:00:29.389
Sure?

02:00:32.733 --> 02:00:34.404
Hmmm?

02:00:51.542 --> 02:00:53.214
I'm sorry.

02:01:03.768 --> 02:01:05.231
Yes.

02:01:34.594 --> 02:01:36.579
Give me the glass, please.

02:01:47.969 --> 02:01:50.477
I want you to mail these.

02:01:52.045 --> 02:01:54.866
This is for---

02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:58.210
This is for my mother.

02:02:00.404 --> 02:02:03.210
This is for
"The New York Times, "

02:02:05.185 --> 02:02:07.679
Margarita and Jorge Camacho.

02:02:10.174 --> 02:02:12.980
"Miami Herald. "

02:02:14.435 --> 02:02:19.943
And, this is for you,
but, don't open it.

02:02:19.944 --> 02:02:23.476
Mail this to yourself,

02:02:23.476 --> 02:02:25.347
and then you open
in your house.

02:02:33.038 --> 02:02:43.742
I have never met a boy
as authentic as you, Lázaro.

02:02:44.885 --> 02:02:46.028
Never.

02:02:59.747 --> 02:03:01.825
Read me something.

02:03:25.936 --> 02:03:27.703
Oh, not that one.

02:03:27.703 --> 02:03:29.678
Not that one,
where's the glass?

02:03:32.796 --> 02:03:34.562
Not that one.

02:04:31.722 --> 02:04:34.736
Rey.
Rey.
