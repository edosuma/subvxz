M_I_SForEver

02:34.298 --> 02:36.234
Where's my little girl?

02:45.309 --> 02:46.810
You okay?

02:48.979 --> 02:50.880
Where's my girl?

03:07.598 --> 03:08.965
Hey.

03:16.140 --> 03:17.141
Oh, baby.

03:17.174 --> 03:19.410
Yeah, there's several masses.

03:19.443 --> 03:23.581
There's one in here,
here, here.

03:23.614 --> 03:25.349
There's another one in here.

03:25.383 --> 03:26.850
Oh, she's in pain.

03:26.883 --> 03:29.153
Well, it's pressing
against her organs.

03:29.186 --> 03:30.254
What do I do?

03:30.288 --> 03:31.455
I can't answer that
for you,

03:31.489 --> 03:33.957
but I can tell you
what your options are.

03:33.990 --> 03:36.227
So it's $177 for today.

03:36.260 --> 03:38.028
That's $65
for a visit

03:38.061 --> 03:41.031
and $112 for a two-week supply
of the medicine.

03:41.064 --> 03:42.099
We fill the syringes...

03:42.133 --> 03:45.202
$112 for the medicine?

03:45.236 --> 03:46.270
Yeah.

03:47.638 --> 03:50.341
Um, do you have a payment plan?

03:50.374 --> 03:52.610
No. Cash or charge.

06:15.753 --> 06:17.020
Hello?

06:17.053 --> 06:20.458
Brady, it's Grandma Kate.

06:20.491 --> 06:21.991
How are you doing, honey?

06:22.025 --> 06:23.327
I'm good,
how are you?

06:23.360 --> 06:24.728
I'm pretty good.

06:24.762 --> 06:29.433
Um, I just got the invitation
to your birthday party.

06:29.467 --> 06:30.668
You must be so excited.

06:30.701 --> 06:32.336
I am excited.

06:32.369 --> 06:34.605
Mm-hm.

06:34.638 --> 06:39.109
Six years old,
such a big boy.

06:39.143 --> 06:41.445
Um, can you put Daddy on

06:41.479 --> 06:43.180
so I can talk to him
about the party?

06:43.214 --> 06:45.616
He's at work.

06:45.649 --> 06:47.418
Oh. Is Mommy there?

06:47.451 --> 06:48.419
I'll go get her.

06:50.654 --> 06:51.455
Hello.

06:51.489 --> 06:53.491
Hi, Liz, it's Kate,
how are you?

06:53.524 --> 06:55.426
I'm good, how are you?

06:55.459 --> 06:58.596
Good, I'm fine, I'm fine.

06:58.629 --> 06:59.797
Working a lot, you know.

06:59.830 --> 07:04.401
Um, I'm actually RSVPing
to Brady's birthday party,

07:04.435 --> 07:09.440
so... so, yes,
I will definitely be there.

07:09.473 --> 07:11.141
Thank you
for the invitation.

07:11.175 --> 07:12.743
Of course.

07:12.776 --> 07:15.079
Um, Jack's not home?

07:15.112 --> 07:17.748
Uh, no, Jack is at work.

07:17.781 --> 07:20.251
What, you haven't spoken to him?

07:20.284 --> 07:23.153
No, no, we haven't spoken much.

07:27.691 --> 07:29.760
I'm going on a break.

07:29.793 --> 07:31.662
Need your help
when you're back, man.

07:31.695 --> 07:33.364
Sure thing.

08:36.559 --> 08:37.660
Hey.

08:37.695 --> 08:39.395
Hi.

09:16.800 --> 09:17.668
Hello?

09:17.701 --> 09:19.370
Hi, Katherine,
It's Stephanie Marx.

09:19.403 --> 09:20.638
Hi, Stephanie.

09:20.671 --> 09:22.573
Do you have openings
in your schedule?

09:22.606 --> 09:25.342
Um, I do have space.

09:25.376 --> 09:26.944
- Okay.
- Yeah.

09:26.977 --> 09:28.912
Bronson's going into hospice.

09:28.946 --> 09:30.414
Oh, too bad.

09:30.447 --> 09:31.415
What's the address?

09:56.674 --> 09:57.641
Hey.

09:57.675 --> 09:59.543
- You the nurse?
- Aide.

09:59.576 --> 10:01.445
Steve.

10:01.478 --> 10:02.613
Come in.

10:04.682 --> 10:06.617
- But you found it okay?
- Mm-hm.

10:06.650 --> 10:08.719
Hey, Lau,
this is Katherine.

10:08.752 --> 10:10.554
- Kate.
- Kate.

10:10.587 --> 10:13.323
Listen, uh, my sister
knows all my numbers,

10:13.357 --> 10:16.293
but everything's also in
a green book in the kitchen.

10:16.326 --> 10:17.528
It's got all her
doctors' information.

10:17.561 --> 10:20.230
The physical therapist
is coming later.

10:20.264 --> 10:21.632
But that's it for today.

10:21.665 --> 10:23.300
You still need me?
'Cause I gotta go.

10:23.333 --> 10:24.535
Then go.

10:25.569 --> 10:26.637
Any issues, call me.

10:26.670 --> 10:28.338
- I'll come right home.
- Okay.

10:30.340 --> 10:31.875
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

10:35.713 --> 10:37.815
Can I sit over there
for a moment?

10:40.718 --> 10:42.453
Yeah, that's fine.

10:42.486 --> 10:45.889
I have some paperwork
I have to do.

10:54.331 --> 10:57.835
So, your accident was when?

10:57.868 --> 10:59.470
Which one?

10:59.503 --> 11:00.537
Whatever was first.

11:00.571 --> 11:03.640
I have to get a history.

11:03.674 --> 11:06.977
The car accident
was four years ago.

11:07.010 --> 11:08.378
October.

11:11.348 --> 11:13.784
Okay, and your injuries?

11:13.817 --> 11:16.854
- T11.
- T11.

11:18.655 --> 11:21.992
Okay, um,
complete or incomplete?

11:22.025 --> 11:24.061
Incomplete.

11:24.095 --> 11:26.764
I still have some feeling.

11:28.932 --> 11:31.034
Do you catheterize yourself?

11:31.068 --> 11:32.402
Usually.

11:32.436 --> 11:33.403
Oh?

11:34.838 --> 11:37.574
I have an indwelling
because of my arm,

11:37.608 --> 11:40.010
and a bag.

11:40.043 --> 11:41.612
Temporary though.

11:41.645 --> 11:44.615
Until I can transfer.

11:44.648 --> 11:45.749
Okay.

11:45.783 --> 11:48.752
And your bowels?

11:48.786 --> 11:50.654
I'm on a program.

11:50.687 --> 11:51.889
That's working out?

11:53.124 --> 11:55.425
It's better than a diaper.

11:58.462 --> 12:01.431
So, from bed to chair
and chair to toilet,

12:01.465 --> 12:03.033
- you can...
- Listen.

12:03.066 --> 12:04.535
I've been doing fine, okay?

12:04.568 --> 12:06.436
It's been four years.

12:06.470 --> 12:08.872
I just happened
to miss the chair

12:08.906 --> 12:10.908
just this once.

12:11.608 --> 12:12.943
Ouch.

12:12.976 --> 12:15.846
Yeah, too many gin and tonics.

12:15.879 --> 12:17.781
Ah.

12:17.815 --> 12:20.617
I fractured
my collarbone, so...

12:20.651 --> 12:23.387
stuck with this
for the next eight weeks.

12:24.454 --> 12:25.856
And apparently you.

12:28.025 --> 12:30.661
I'm not sure
which is worse.

12:30.694 --> 12:32.496
I'll let you know.

12:36.134 --> 12:37.801
Am I your first?

12:40.003 --> 12:40.971
Yeah.

12:46.844 --> 12:50.514
So, what do you need me
to do for you?

12:50.547 --> 12:53.517
You seem to be
pretty self-sufficient.

12:53.550 --> 12:56.087
I am.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.956
I just happen to be without
a left arm at the moment.

13:00.657 --> 13:02.392
I can help you with that.

13:12.069 --> 13:14.705
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

13:42.466 --> 13:43.934
Can you please?

13:45.002 --> 13:47.105
Here, take that to your mom.

13:48.505 --> 13:49.673
Thank you.

14:02.719 --> 14:04.554
Thanks.

14:04.588 --> 14:06.890
Looks delicious.

14:06.924 --> 14:08.458
Elizabeth bake it?

14:10.228 --> 14:12.629
I don't know
how she finds the time.

14:14.631 --> 14:16.633
What, did you hit the lottery?

14:16.667 --> 14:17.768
I wish.

14:19.870 --> 14:22.673
Yeah, well,
you didn't have to do that.

14:22.706 --> 14:24.041
It's too much.

14:24.074 --> 14:25.143
It's what he wanted.

14:25.176 --> 14:28.645
Yeah, well, it's too much.

14:33.817 --> 14:35.619
How's your father?

14:35.652 --> 14:37.721
Fine.

14:37.754 --> 14:39.890
I thought I'd see him here.

14:39.923 --> 14:42.059
Couldn't get a flight.

14:48.532 --> 14:51.235
So, you're working nights now?

14:53.003 --> 14:54.172
Mm-hm.

14:55.672 --> 14:57.641
When'd you leave McMillen?

14:57.674 --> 14:59.210
Uh, I don't know.

14:59.243 --> 15:01.112
Four, five months ago.

15:04.748 --> 15:06.250
You happy?

15:09.653 --> 15:10.954
It's a job, Ma.

15:10.988 --> 15:12.856
You happy wiping asses
all day?

15:35.213 --> 15:36.180
You goin'?

15:38.648 --> 15:39.983
Come in, Grandma.

15:40.017 --> 15:41.618
You little rascal.

15:42.919 --> 15:44.621
Grandma doesn't
go in the water.

15:44.654 --> 15:46.056
She never did.

16:13.251 --> 16:15.219
Sorry, Kate,
rough morning.

16:15.253 --> 16:16.220
- She okay?
- Yeah.

16:16.254 --> 16:18.322
Can you get the chair?
It's in the trunk.

16:18.356 --> 16:19.790
Sure.

16:25.229 --> 16:26.663
Ow, you're hurting me.

16:26.696 --> 16:28.099
I'm sorry,
but I gotta get you out.

16:28.132 --> 16:29.367
- You're drunk.
- No, I'm not.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.934
Yeah, okay.

16:35.373 --> 16:37.908
Maggie's parents
invited us over for brunch.

16:37.941 --> 16:39.976
It's always
a little tough on her.

16:40.010 --> 16:41.812
Uh, can you take it
from here?

16:41.845 --> 16:43.147
Sorry, but I gotta go to work.

16:43.181 --> 16:44.681
Shit, I'm gonna hit mad traffic.

16:44.714 --> 16:46.049
- Sure.
- You're good?

16:46.084 --> 16:47.385
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

16:47.418 --> 16:48.652
Just watch her shoulder,
all right?

16:48.685 --> 16:49.454
Uh, yes.

16:49.487 --> 16:51.189
I'll get my stuff
real quick.

17:14.044 --> 17:15.313
Hi, Kate.

17:15.346 --> 17:16.680
Hi.

17:33.864 --> 17:36.933
Sorry about earlier.

17:36.967 --> 17:39.270
You don't have
to apologize to me.

17:42.173 --> 17:43.640
It's just...

17:45.008 --> 17:48.879
Every time I see
Maggie's parents,

17:48.912 --> 17:50.881
I miss her.

18:11.135 --> 18:12.869
Is it too hot?

18:12.903 --> 18:14.172
No.

18:16.307 --> 18:17.375
Am I too rough?

18:17.408 --> 18:18.808
I never know.

18:20.244 --> 18:21.945
No, you're fine.

18:23.414 --> 18:24.382
Feels nice.

18:36.927 --> 18:39.829
Okay, let me see
your sneakers now.

18:39.863 --> 18:41.998
I just got 'em yesterday.

18:42.032 --> 18:44.734
- Cool, nice colors.
- I picked 'em out myself.

18:44.768 --> 18:45.735
Could I get you
anything else?

18:45.769 --> 18:47.405
Uh, no, just the check,
thank you.

18:47.438 --> 18:49.106
- There you are.
- Thank you.

18:49.140 --> 18:50.807
Okay, sweetie,
you go finish.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.775
Mommy's gonna be here soon.

18:51.808 --> 18:55.011
I'm gonna go over there,
pay the bill, okay?

18:55.045 --> 18:56.314
- Okay.
- All right.

18:59.483 --> 19:01.285
Hello.

19:01.319 --> 19:02.353
$6.31.

19:02.386 --> 19:06.290
Thank you.

19:06.324 --> 19:09.427
Um, I have four.

19:09.460 --> 19:11.162
Grandma, look.

19:11.195 --> 19:12.263
Oh.

19:16.933 --> 19:19.035
Got my change.

19:19.069 --> 19:24.375
Fifty, sixty, seventy.

19:24.408 --> 19:26.843
I forgot the tax,
I'm sorry.

19:33.251 --> 19:35.018
You know what?
It's okay, it's okay.

19:35.051 --> 19:36.454
We're all right.

19:44.228 --> 19:45.929
Thank you.

19:51.269 --> 19:52.270
Is that good?

19:58.276 --> 20:00.511
Mm, I love you.

20:00.544 --> 20:02.380
Have a good day
at school tomorrow, okay?

20:02.413 --> 20:03.980
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.454
Seatbelt.

20:10.488 --> 20:11.455
Thanks, Kate.

20:45.489 --> 20:48.326
- 31.
- Hello?

20:48.359 --> 20:50.261
Come in!
Door's open.

20:51.429 --> 20:53.497
There you go.

20:53.531 --> 20:55.599
Hey, you don't have
to knock, Kate.

20:55.633 --> 20:56.600
How's everything?

20:56.634 --> 20:58.968
Well, I'm just kicking her ass.

20:59.002 --> 21:00.970
Wanna jump in here?

21:01.004 --> 21:02.406
Uh, don't I have work to do?

21:02.440 --> 21:05.008
No, you need to sit
and play first.

21:05.041 --> 21:07.311
Well, I gotta finish
this game, so sit.

21:07.345 --> 21:08.646
- What's the game?
- Cribbage.

21:08.679 --> 21:10.181
Oh, I don't know
how to play that.

21:10.214 --> 21:12.416
Wait, you don't know
how to play cribbage?

21:12.450 --> 21:14.151
Neither does he.
He cheats.

21:14.185 --> 21:15.286
It's like the oldest game
in the world.

21:15.319 --> 21:16.320
I mean, I've heard of it.

21:16.354 --> 21:18.255
No, 17th century, Kate.

21:18.289 --> 21:19.956
Look at him,
he's like an old man.

21:19.989 --> 21:21.258
He gets so excited
about cribbage.

21:21.292 --> 21:23.127
He's like our father.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.396
It's actually much more fun
when we make it a drinking game.

21:25.429 --> 21:27.431
- Right, Lau?
- Yeah.

21:27.465 --> 21:29.065
I bet.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.267
Careful though.

21:30.301 --> 21:32.503
She's very competitive.

21:32.536 --> 21:34.105
She throws things at you
if you beat her.

21:34.138 --> 21:35.106
I do not.

21:35.139 --> 21:36.607
No, check this out.

21:36.640 --> 21:37.608
- See?
- Mm-hm.

21:37.641 --> 21:39.176
Yeah, backgammon.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.479
- I was eight.
- Five staples in my head.

21:41.512 --> 21:43.481
- And this one. See that?
- Mm-hm.

21:43.514 --> 21:45.282
- Parcheesi.
- He cheats.

21:45.316 --> 21:47.651
You assaulted me
with a boardgame.

21:47.685 --> 21:48.719
Oh, you know what,
be careful

21:48.753 --> 21:50.388
or I'm gonna shove
this cribbage up your ass.

21:50.421 --> 21:51.622
Ohh.

21:51.655 --> 21:53.290
Ooh, I may like it.

21:55.426 --> 21:57.661
- Going to the gym.
- Good. Bye.

22:01.699 --> 22:03.300
So you ready for the rules?

22:03.334 --> 22:07.104
Okay, so, uh,
10 plus five is 15.

22:07.138 --> 22:10.006
And I have a pair of...
that's two points.

22:10.039 --> 22:11.709
And then I have
a pair of twos

22:11.742 --> 22:15.146
and that's four points,
is that it?

22:15.179 --> 22:16.514
- Did you check your crib?
- Yeah.

22:17.415 --> 22:18.982
I had nothing.

22:19.015 --> 22:19.983
Sounds about right.

22:20.016 --> 22:20.984
Mm!

22:21.017 --> 22:22.353
This is fun.

22:22.386 --> 22:23.521
It's fun
because you're winning.

22:24.555 --> 22:25.689
Maybe.

22:30.094 --> 22:33.531
So, really, there's no one
to play with at home?

22:35.031 --> 22:38.235
No, my... my son is married.

22:38.269 --> 22:40.069
You have a son.

22:40.104 --> 22:42.506
Yeah.

22:42.540 --> 22:44.241
And a grandson.

22:44.275 --> 22:45.242
Wow.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.544
Yeah, I know.

22:46.577 --> 22:48.612
- I'm old.
- No, no, I didn't...

22:48.646 --> 22:49.580
I didn't mean it like that.

22:49.613 --> 22:52.416
I... I just didn't think
you had a family

22:52.450 --> 22:54.685
for some strange reason.

22:57.121 --> 22:59.223
Maybe because I don't.

23:02.226 --> 23:05.629
It's a complicated one.

23:05.663 --> 23:08.031
Aren't all relationships?

23:11.435 --> 23:14.438
Well, gin and tonics
definitely don't help.

23:20.177 --> 23:23.247
No, no they don't.

23:24.582 --> 23:25.616
I wish they did though.

23:35.359 --> 23:36.727
Okay.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.362
- Tell me if I hurt you.
- Okay.

23:45.469 --> 23:47.036
Um...

23:47.070 --> 23:49.072
I'll just put my arm
around your neck.

23:49.106 --> 23:50.341
Oh, okay.

23:51.442 --> 23:54.178
All right, I got you.

24:03.153 --> 24:04.121
Okay.

24:36.887 --> 24:38.622
Thought you quit.

24:38.656 --> 24:40.724
I thought I did too.

24:40.758 --> 24:42.393
Never in front of Brady.

24:42.426 --> 24:43.394
Mm.

24:46.297 --> 24:47.765
You wanna come in?

24:47.798 --> 24:49.133
- No.
- Okay.

24:49.166 --> 24:51.435
Uh, Brady made this for you.

24:51.468 --> 24:54.738
He asked me to drop it off,
hand it to you directly, so...

24:54.772 --> 24:56.106
Hm.

24:57.541 --> 24:59.710
I try to keep my promises.

25:03.714 --> 25:05.516
You guys went for ice cream?

25:05.549 --> 25:06.650
We did.

25:07.685 --> 25:09.086
He drew us.

25:10.321 --> 25:11.889
Liz dropped him off?

25:11.922 --> 25:13.757
And picked him up.

25:17.861 --> 25:21.265
You know, you don't have
to keep doing stuff for him.

25:21.298 --> 25:22.600
- I enjoy him.
- Yeah, I just...

25:22.633 --> 25:26.704
I just don't want him
to get too close.

25:33.711 --> 25:34.812
How's the cat?

25:34.845 --> 25:36.513
Brady said she's sick.

25:37.615 --> 25:39.249
She's dying.

25:39.283 --> 25:41.452
Gotta be like 20 years old.

25:41.485 --> 25:44.421
I was 11 when Dad
brought her home.

25:44.455 --> 25:46.724
She's about that.

25:46.757 --> 25:48.892
Is that 90
in cat years?

25:50.961 --> 25:52.896
You'd think so.

25:56.233 --> 25:57.501
Wanna see her?

26:04.742 --> 26:06.477
She's in there.

26:08.712 --> 26:10.814
Oh.

26:10.848 --> 26:13.283
Hey, MK.

26:13.917 --> 26:15.819
Hey.

26:15.853 --> 26:17.888
You remember me?

26:17.921 --> 26:20.491
It's been so long.

26:20.524 --> 26:21.825
She's so skinny.

26:21.859 --> 26:24.728
Well, she can't eat.

26:24.762 --> 26:26.430
Sweet.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.403
She's so sweet.

26:33.370 --> 26:35.472
Oh, she smells terrible.

26:37.007 --> 26:37.875
Oh, I can't...

26:37.908 --> 26:40.644
- Here.
- Well, she can't wash herself

26:40.678 --> 26:42.446
and every time
I try she cries.

26:42.479 --> 26:43.681
Come here, baby.

26:43.714 --> 26:46.283
Yeah, I got you,
I got you, I got you.

26:46.316 --> 26:49.319
Oh, you're so soft.

26:49.353 --> 26:51.822
Gonna be okay,
gonna be okay.

26:52.890 --> 26:54.625
Gonna put you back.

26:54.658 --> 26:56.694
Oh, I know,
it hurts, it hurts.

26:57.928 --> 26:59.430
Here we go.

27:03.634 --> 27:04.601
Do you want a cup of coffee?

27:04.635 --> 27:05.836
I have the one you like.

27:05.869 --> 27:08.639
No, I'm good,
I gotta get to work.

27:08.672 --> 27:10.240
You need to stop smoking.

27:10.274 --> 27:11.809
That shit's gonna kill you.

27:13.610 --> 27:15.312
Thank you, Jack.

27:18.749 --> 27:19.983
Just squeeze it slow, okay?

27:20.017 --> 27:22.019
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:22.052 --> 27:23.620
- You got it?
- Yeah.

27:23.654 --> 27:25.556
All right,
give me a couple more.

27:25.589 --> 27:27.024
- Okay.
- Good.

27:27.057 --> 27:29.359
- And how's that feel?
- It hurts.

27:29.393 --> 27:31.261
Okay, look, we're working
from the bottom up, okay?

27:31.295 --> 27:32.296
Okay.

27:59.456 --> 28:01.358
- Let's try another set, okay?
- Okay.

28:01.391 --> 28:02.593
So it's essentially the same.

28:02.626 --> 28:03.727
- Okay.
- All right?

28:03.761 --> 28:05.329
Gonna try that
for 10 reps, okay?

28:05.362 --> 28:06.164
No.

28:06.197 --> 28:08.866
You can do 10,
I have faith in you.

28:08.899 --> 28:09.900
We'll try for eight then.

28:09.933 --> 28:10.801
- Okay.
- Okay?

28:10.834 --> 28:12.369
Maybe you can give me
two extra, okay?

28:12.402 --> 28:14.438
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

28:14.471 --> 28:16.540
And again.

28:16.573 --> 28:17.841
Kate?

28:17.875 --> 28:19.910
I'll be right there.

28:22.012 --> 28:23.947
So, just relax it for the rest
of the day, all right?

28:23.981 --> 28:25.949
- Okay.
- Hey, no partying.

28:25.983 --> 28:28.051
Okay, no partying.

28:29.553 --> 28:31.688
- Later, Kate.
- Bye, Billy.

28:31.722 --> 28:32.923
- Hey!
- Hi.

28:32.956 --> 28:35.592
What's going on out there?

28:35.626 --> 28:36.660
Dishes, just...

28:36.693 --> 28:39.630
Ugh, I don't want you
doing Steve's dishes.

28:39.663 --> 28:42.032
He's a slob,
he can do his own dishes.

28:44.001 --> 28:47.905
I found this
and I thought of you.

28:47.938 --> 28:50.507
Weirdly enough,
I have several, so...

28:53.510 --> 28:54.478
What is it?

28:54.511 --> 28:55.946
Just open it.

29:04.621 --> 29:05.789
Cribbage.

29:05.823 --> 29:07.091
I mean, you kicked my ass,

29:07.125 --> 29:09.760
so, I felt like
you should have your own.

29:09.793 --> 29:11.095
- You're a natural.
- Thank you.

29:13.164 --> 29:15.399
And who knows?
I mean, maybe someday

29:15.432 --> 29:17.434
you'll have somebody
to play with.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.374
Thank you.

29:50.767 --> 29:52.136
Is it morning?

29:53.871 --> 29:55.806
Why are you here so early?

29:55.839 --> 29:58.976
Um, Brady has his first
soccer game this afternoon.

29:59.009 --> 30:00.677
Oh, it's today.

30:00.711 --> 30:01.812
Yeah.

30:01.845 --> 30:05.149
Steve and I switched,
so he'll be here later instead.

30:05.183 --> 30:07.384
- Remember?
- Yeah.

30:09.220 --> 30:11.189
Sleep well?

30:11.222 --> 30:12.556
Yeah.

30:13.824 --> 30:16.160
Anything bothering you?

30:16.194 --> 30:17.961
Shoulder okay?

30:17.995 --> 30:19.097
Yeah.

30:20.530 --> 30:22.133
Okay.

30:23.600 --> 30:24.735
What are you reading?

30:24.768 --> 30:25.903
Um...

30:28.005 --> 30:31.508
I'm actually reading

30:31.541 --> 30:34.611
about a nurse
who kills his patients.

30:35.679 --> 30:37.148
Oh, that's encouraging.

30:37.181 --> 30:38.316
Are you getting
some tips?

30:38.349 --> 30:42.786
No, I just picked it up
at a yard sale for a quarter.

30:42.819 --> 30:44.721
Yeah, sure.

30:44.755 --> 30:45.889
I don't know how I'm gonna
get through it though,

30:45.923 --> 30:46.924
it's so disturbing.

30:46.957 --> 30:47.991
Do you know the story?

30:48.025 --> 30:49.127
I do.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.228
Oh, really?

30:50.261 --> 30:53.197
He was actually an inmate
when I worked in Jersey.

30:55.065 --> 30:57.668
You were
a correction officer too?

30:57.701 --> 30:59.670
And Steve.

30:59.703 --> 31:01.205
And my dad.

31:03.107 --> 31:05.876
I was actually Steve's boss.

31:05.909 --> 31:07.245
Wow.

31:07.278 --> 31:10.013
Runs in the family.

31:10.047 --> 31:11.782
Yeah, I guess.

31:14.551 --> 31:17.788
You must have seen
some of the worst people.

31:17.821 --> 31:19.157
I did.

31:20.590 --> 31:23.961
Saw some good ones too, though.

31:23.994 --> 31:30.201
People that just made
one bad decision, you know?

31:30.234 --> 31:36.073
Just one decision one time.

31:40.043 --> 31:42.080
Same prison though.

31:49.052 --> 31:50.020
Do you like soccer?

31:53.291 --> 31:54.258
Go, guys!

32:00.231 --> 32:02.300
- Go, guys!
- Go, go, go!

32:14.644 --> 32:17.047
Go, go, go!

32:17.081 --> 32:17.948
Woo!

32:17.981 --> 32:21.585
Come on, Brady!
Brady, you can do it!

32:21.618 --> 32:23.587
Go, go, go!

32:23.620 --> 32:25.689
Come on, come on,
you can do this!

32:25.722 --> 32:28.925
Woo! Yes, Brady!
Good! Good boy!

32:31.195 --> 32:32.729
Run, Brady!

32:37.601 --> 32:38.568
Agh!

32:38.602 --> 32:40.871
- Yes!
- Nice kick, dude.

32:40.904 --> 32:42.173
Woo!

32:42.206 --> 32:43.707
Yeah, buddy.

32:44.841 --> 32:45.809
Woo!

32:45.842 --> 32:46.810
All right.

32:58.655 --> 33:00.158
- Woo!
- Grayson, you got this.

33:00.191 --> 33:01.225
Grayson, go, go, go.

33:01.259 --> 33:04.728
Go, Amber!
Go, Amber! Go, Amber!

33:06.997 --> 33:08.232
You did so well.

33:08.266 --> 33:10.134
How did you...
how did you learn?

33:10.168 --> 33:12.002
Where did you learn
how to play?

33:12.035 --> 33:13.770
- I just tried.
- When was the last...

33:13.804 --> 33:15.872
who taught you
how to play?

33:15.906 --> 33:17.774
Uh, my teacher.

33:17.808 --> 33:18.809
- Your coach?
- Yeah.

33:18.842 --> 33:20.111
Come on, buddy, let's go.

33:21.645 --> 33:22.679
- Come on, let's go, bud.
- Love you so much.

33:22.712 --> 33:24.014
- Love you, bye!
- You were so good.

33:24.047 --> 33:26.250
You did so good!
You were so fast.

33:26.284 --> 33:27.851
How many goals
did you score?

33:37.161 --> 33:38.628
MK, I'm home.

33:42.065 --> 33:44.168
Where's my girl, hm?

33:54.345 --> 33:56.980
Oh, MK.

33:59.317 --> 34:01.818
Why are you hanging on, baby?

34:04.222 --> 34:06.656
You were in a dumpster.

34:09.025 --> 34:12.963
Jim heard you crying,
so he jumped in.

34:12.996 --> 34:15.699
And he saved you
and brought you home.

34:18.969 --> 34:20.837
And you loved
that house.

34:22.706 --> 34:23.974
Used to...

34:26.244 --> 34:28.978
...curl up on that
windowsill for hours.

34:31.181 --> 34:33.351
Lying in the sun
all day.

34:35.353 --> 34:36.686
You fur would get so hot,

34:36.719 --> 34:37.954
but you just...

34:40.458 --> 34:42.025
...loved it.

34:46.862 --> 34:48.232
We loved you.

34:51.435 --> 34:53.271
Jim, Jack.

34:55.505 --> 34:57.974
Me.

35:00.478 --> 35:03.481
You have just been the best
friend to me, know that?.

35:06.217 --> 35:08.352
Been through so much
together.

35:14.158 --> 35:16.394
But it's okay
for you to go, okay?

35:19.829 --> 35:22.333
Don't suffer for me.

35:28.004 --> 35:29.507
I'm gonna be fine.

35:34.178 --> 35:35.179
Up, up, up.

35:35.213 --> 35:36.980
Go, one more, go, come on.

35:37.013 --> 35:38.449
Come on, one more.

35:38.482 --> 35:40.451
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

35:41.985 --> 35:44.388
Two, good.
Excellent, I'll take that.

35:44.422 --> 35:45.523
How'd that feel?

35:45.556 --> 35:47.291
- Hurts.
- Hurts.

35:47.325 --> 35:48.925
Good job.

35:48.959 --> 35:50.461
I knocked
but nobody heard me,

35:50.494 --> 35:52.062
so I let myself in.

35:52.096 --> 35:53.264
You Laura?

35:53.297 --> 35:54.265
Yeah.

35:54.298 --> 35:56.334
I'm Gloria,
I'm your aide.

35:56.367 --> 35:57.335
I'm gonna put myself
in the other room

35:57.368 --> 35:58.802
if that's okay.

35:58.835 --> 36:00.438
Yeah, that's fine,
where's Kate?

36:00.471 --> 36:01.372
They don't tell me nothing,

36:01.405 --> 36:04.007
just give me the address,
that's it.

36:51.155 --> 36:52.290
Hello?

36:53.524 --> 36:54.858
Jack.

37:20.484 --> 37:23.220
I gotta get home,
get ready for work.

37:29.460 --> 37:31.329
You're gonna be okay?

37:33.963 --> 37:36.066
She's in a better place.

37:40.271 --> 37:42.173
All right?

37:47.911 --> 37:51.582
It... it... it'll be okay.

37:53.150 --> 37:55.018
Thanks for coming, Jack.

37:56.554 --> 37:58.255
She was a good cat.

38:38.229 --> 38:41.064
- Grandma!
- Oh, my boy!

38:41.098 --> 38:43.234
Yay! Oh, how I missed you!

38:43.267 --> 38:44.235
Hi, Kate.

38:44.268 --> 38:46.103
Hi, thanks for bringing him.

38:46.137 --> 38:49.106
- So, two hours good?
- Yeah!

38:51.142 --> 38:53.310
Okay, I guess I'm going,
I'm going.

38:53.344 --> 38:55.312
- Come on!
- Call you later, Brady.

38:55.346 --> 38:57.481
- Bye, Mom!
- I love you.

39:00.117 --> 39:01.685
You hungry?

39:01.719 --> 39:02.586
A little.

39:02.620 --> 39:05.156
Did you make
peanut butter sandwiches?

39:05.189 --> 39:07.191
No, I didn't.

39:07.224 --> 39:09.293
Didn't know how long
I'd have you today.

39:09.326 --> 39:17.535
But, I did find a dollar bill
on the floor on my way here.

39:17.568 --> 39:19.437
- You did?
- Mm-hm.

39:19.470 --> 39:21.004
I think today
is my lucky day.

39:21.037 --> 39:23.441
I get to see you
and I found a dollar.

39:23.474 --> 39:24.442
That is lucky.

39:24.475 --> 39:26.744
Well, it's your lucky day too.

39:26.777 --> 39:28.345
How come?

39:28.379 --> 39:30.514
'Cause now I get
to buy you an ice cream.

39:30.548 --> 39:31.615
Yeah!

39:31.649 --> 39:33.384
Let's go see what he has.

39:33.417 --> 39:34.385
I'll race you.

39:34.418 --> 39:35.419
Come on.

39:35.453 --> 39:37.121
Come on, Grandma, come on.

39:37.154 --> 39:38.122
I can't race you!

39:38.155 --> 39:39.356
You're too fast for me.

39:39.390 --> 39:41.425
Look how fast I am.

39:46.029 --> 39:48.064
Oh no, what happened to you?

39:48.098 --> 39:50.234
He was running
and his shoe was untied.

39:50.267 --> 39:51.335
I am so sorry.

39:51.368 --> 39:53.270
Oh, are you okay?

39:53.304 --> 39:54.672
They checked him out
at first aid.

39:54.705 --> 39:57.575
You gotta keep
those shoes tied, buddy.

39:57.608 --> 39:59.143
You sure Grandma
didn't beat you up?

39:59.176 --> 40:00.377
Oh, I feel terrible.

40:01.412 --> 40:02.379
Did he hit his head?

40:02.413 --> 40:04.114
No, no, he just slid.

40:04.148 --> 40:06.183
Let me see
that handsome face.

40:06.217 --> 40:07.551
Oh, I'm so sorry.

40:07.585 --> 40:09.487
Hey, it's fine.
It happens.

40:09.520 --> 40:12.089
We all fall, right?

40:12.122 --> 40:13.157
Well, go give Grandma a kiss.

40:13.190 --> 40:14.792
We gotta go.

40:14.825 --> 40:18.762
I am so sorry
you got hurt, sweetie.

40:18.796 --> 40:20.063
Okay.

40:20.097 --> 40:21.765
Ready to go home?

40:37.648 --> 40:40.184
Hey, where you been, sick?

40:42.520 --> 40:43.687
Yeah.

40:43.721 --> 40:45.289
Well, I'm glad you're back.

40:45.322 --> 40:47.324
We had that Black chick, Gloria.

40:47.358 --> 40:48.559
You know her?

40:48.592 --> 40:50.059
Not personally.

40:50.094 --> 40:52.429
Well, what a waste of life.

40:52.463 --> 40:54.398
I think she stole money from us.

40:54.431 --> 40:56.333
Fuckin' skell.

40:58.235 --> 40:59.703
I never heard that
about her.

40:59.737 --> 41:00.571
Yeah?

41:00.604 --> 41:03.274
Well, I'm gonna report
her fat ass.

41:13.684 --> 41:15.051
Hi.

41:16.353 --> 41:17.721
How are you?

41:17.755 --> 41:20.524
I'm doing better,
how are you?

41:20.558 --> 41:21.625
I'm okay.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.129
You don't seem okay.

41:26.463 --> 41:27.731
Were you sick?

41:29.533 --> 41:32.770
Did I do something
to upset you?

41:32.803 --> 41:35.806
Did Steve? Because he can be
a real asshole.

41:35.839 --> 41:37.608
Will you just stop?

41:39.310 --> 41:40.844
What's goin' on?

41:46.750 --> 41:53.691
I know this sounds stupid,
but... my cat died.

41:53.724 --> 41:57.328
That's not stupid.

41:57.361 --> 41:58.462
Was he sick?

41:58.495 --> 41:59.830
She was.

42:01.165 --> 42:03.133
What was her name?

42:05.536 --> 42:06.503
MK.

42:07.571 --> 42:09.873
- MK?
- Moo Kitty.

42:09.907 --> 42:12.476
Aw.

42:12.509 --> 42:14.144
I think gin and tonics
had a little something

42:14.178 --> 42:16.847
- to do with that.
- No...

42:16.880 --> 42:19.416
Jack named her
when he was little.

42:19.450 --> 42:22.519
She had all these little
black spots like a cow.

42:25.189 --> 42:27.391
I bet she was something.

42:29.526 --> 42:31.629
Yeah, she was.

42:39.436 --> 42:40.871
I missed you.

42:51.582 --> 42:52.683
Goin' to work.

42:54.351 --> 42:55.552
You need anything, Lau?

42:55.586 --> 42:57.154
No, I'm good.

43:01.592 --> 43:03.661
Kate, take care
of the dishes please.

43:03.694 --> 43:05.529
It's not her job to do
your dishes, Steve.

43:05.562 --> 43:06.730
Uh, really?

43:06.764 --> 43:08.265
- Since when?
- I don't mind.

43:08.298 --> 43:09.933
No, do your own dishes,
Steve.

43:11.735 --> 43:13.604
So dishes aren't a part
of the job description,

43:13.637 --> 43:15.506
but that is?

43:40.464 --> 43:41.432
Liz made it.

43:41.465 --> 43:44.401
She asked me to drop it off.

43:44.435 --> 43:46.203
She's sweet.

43:47.371 --> 43:48.806
- Thank her for me.
- Mm.

43:51.375 --> 43:53.010
Did Brady get
the card I sent?

43:53.043 --> 43:54.378
Mm-hm.

43:55.446 --> 43:56.647
How is he?

44:01.385 --> 44:03.620
Were you drinking
at the park?

44:06.323 --> 44:07.458
Of course not.

44:07.491 --> 44:08.358
Don't say
of course not

44:08.392 --> 44:10.360
like that's out
of the question for you.

44:10.394 --> 44:11.628
Don't embarrass yourself.

44:11.662 --> 44:12.996
I wasn't drinking.

44:13.030 --> 44:15.899
Well, my son's face
is a fucking mess.

44:15.933 --> 44:17.768
He fell on the concrete,
I told Liz.

44:17.801 --> 44:20.437
I don't want you
to see him anymore.

44:23.373 --> 44:25.442
Because his shoelaces
were untied and he fell?

44:25.476 --> 44:27.377
Why didn't you tie them?

44:29.446 --> 44:30.514
I didn't notice.

44:30.547 --> 44:32.883
That's the problem.

44:32.916 --> 44:34.518
You need to notice.

44:34.551 --> 44:36.453
He's six years old.

44:36.487 --> 44:37.654
I'm so sorry, Jack.

44:37.688 --> 44:39.523
Yeah, I can't trust you
with him.

44:40.824 --> 44:42.059
It's been 10 years.

44:42.093 --> 44:44.862
I don't fucking care
how long it's been.

44:44.895 --> 44:45.763
You're still
the same woman

44:45.796 --> 44:47.831
who used to pass out
in her own vomit.

44:47.865 --> 44:50.000
You showed up
at my fucking graduation wasted.

44:50.033 --> 44:52.903
You crashed my car.

44:52.936 --> 44:54.571
Not even, not even close.

44:54.605 --> 44:55.806
- No?
- No.

44:55.839 --> 44:59.042
Look, you quit, right?

45:00.978 --> 45:03.313
I told you to get
a cell phone.

45:05.582 --> 45:07.885
Look, I know that
you're going through

45:07.918 --> 45:10.988
a lot of stuff
with MK and, uh...

45:11.021 --> 45:13.524
I just don't think
you're as... as attentive

45:13.557 --> 45:16.627
as you need to be
with a six-year-old, okay?

45:16.660 --> 45:18.462
I'll never get it right
for you, will I, Jack?

45:18.495 --> 45:20.430
Oh, I knew that one
was coming.

45:20.464 --> 45:22.900
Poor Kate, you know,
I'm his father.

45:22.933 --> 45:24.668
I need to protect him,
that's what a parent

45:24.701 --> 45:26.603
is supposed to do,
protect their kids.

45:26.637 --> 45:28.438
Protect him from someone
who loves him?

45:28.472 --> 45:31.041
Who are you kidding?
You never loved anyone.

45:31.074 --> 45:33.877
Except yourself
and your booze.

45:37.614 --> 45:38.582
Please don't do this, Jack.

45:38.615 --> 45:40.684
Don't...

45:40.717 --> 45:41.952
It's gonna break
Brady's heart.

45:41.985 --> 45:43.821
He'll get over it.

45:57.467 --> 45:58.468
Hi.

45:58.502 --> 46:00.003
Can you help me set up?

46:00.037 --> 46:02.106
Or is that not part
of the job description?

46:02.140 --> 46:04.441
Uh... no, it's part of the job.

46:04.474 --> 46:05.776
I can help.

46:05.809 --> 46:07.010
These go in the fridge.

46:15.452 --> 46:16.987
You're having a party?

46:17.020 --> 46:19.556
Yeah, a few guys from work.

46:19.590 --> 46:22.693
And a girl
I want Laura to meet.

46:22.726 --> 46:23.927
I think it'll be good
for her.

46:25.462 --> 46:26.530
You married, Kate?

46:29.967 --> 46:31.768
- Divorced.
- Hm.

46:31.802 --> 46:33.637
Well, she needs
to get out there again.

46:33.670 --> 46:36.073
She's a good-looking girl,
my sister.

46:36.107 --> 46:37.774
She can still
have anyone she wants.

46:40.043 --> 46:41.011
Do you want me
to go help her?

46:41.044 --> 46:43.647
No, put the rest of the beers
in the fridge,

46:43.680 --> 46:45.149
uh, booze goes
on the table over there,

46:45.183 --> 46:46.817
and clean off
these trays please.

46:46.850 --> 46:48.186
I'm gonna get limes real quick.

46:48.219 --> 46:50.053
Be right back, all right?

46:50.088 --> 46:51.054
Okay.

46:52.090 --> 46:53.790
All right.

46:59.029 --> 47:00.831
- Hey.
- Hi.

47:00.864 --> 47:02.599
I didn't know
you were here.

47:04.801 --> 47:08.172
Yeah, I was, uh,
helping Steve out.

47:09.806 --> 47:10.941
Yeah.

47:12.643 --> 47:14.811
It's gonna be some party.

47:14.845 --> 47:16.847
Yeah, I guess.

47:18.015 --> 47:19.816
I'm really glad you're here.

47:26.224 --> 47:28.226
Would you mind brushing
the back of my hair?

47:28.259 --> 47:30.427
I can't reach it.

47:32.696 --> 47:33.730
Sure.

47:34.831 --> 47:36.167
Thanks.

47:46.810 --> 47:48.912
How's your shoulder today?

47:48.946 --> 47:50.847
It's okay.

47:50.881 --> 47:52.749
Billy said I can lose
the sling, so...

47:52.783 --> 47:55.186
- Oh, that's good.
- Yeah.

47:55.219 --> 47:57.654
I just can't put
any pressure on it.

48:12.736 --> 48:15.072
Would you mind
putting some on my back?

49:40.124 --> 49:41.192
I can't.

49:48.299 --> 49:49.733
I can't.

50:14.125 --> 50:15.859
Kate, I'm back.

50:18.196 --> 50:19.163
Kate?

50:54.098 --> 50:57.101
I had the best time, but it
was just really challenging,

50:57.135 --> 50:58.102
you know?

50:59.370 --> 51:02.038
And I don't know,
it's hard to explain.

51:02.072 --> 51:05.343
It was just... it was very.

51:07.245 --> 51:08.745
Hey, what's going on?

51:08.778 --> 51:09.746
Come on, let's go dance.

51:09.779 --> 51:11.349
No, no, I'm good, thanks.

51:11.382 --> 51:13.217
Come on, you wanna go dancing?

51:13.251 --> 51:14.218
Come on, Kristy, me and you.

51:14.252 --> 51:15.752
No.

51:15.785 --> 51:16.753
Yo, come on.

51:20.224 --> 51:22.726
What, that one weekend
in Miami you went to?

51:31.502 --> 51:32.470
Hey.

51:32.503 --> 51:33.571
Come with me.

51:33.604 --> 51:35.239
- You'll be on my team.
- I don't wanna play.

51:35.273 --> 51:36.072
Oh, come on, come on,

51:36.107 --> 51:37.308
you'll play with me
and Kristy.

51:37.341 --> 51:38.209
She's cute, right?

51:38.242 --> 51:39.743
And she doesn't care
about the chair.

51:39.776 --> 51:41.011
Look, I don't want
to play beer pong.

51:41.044 --> 51:42.812
Oh, come on, she likes you.

51:42.846 --> 51:44.948
Steve, I don't wanna play!

51:50.354 --> 51:51.955
That's a lot of gin.

51:51.988 --> 51:53.391
I like it strong.

51:55.892 --> 51:57.761
I'm gonna stick to beer.

51:57.794 --> 51:59.729
That shit makes me sick.

52:03.467 --> 52:05.035
So you work with Steve?

52:05.068 --> 52:07.171
Yeah, um, you know,

52:07.205 --> 52:09.106
we've actually hung out
a couple of times before.

52:09.140 --> 52:11.309
We went to lunch once,
you, me, and Steve.

52:11.342 --> 52:12.476
Did we?

52:12.510 --> 52:14.512
I'm sorry,
I don't remember you.

52:14.545 --> 52:16.113
My head kind of banged up.

52:16.147 --> 52:18.349
Oh, no, stop.

52:18.382 --> 52:21.185
I just never got a chance
to tell you how sorry I was

52:21.219 --> 52:23.820
about your girlfriend,
Maggie.

52:23.853 --> 52:26.357
And you seem
to be doing great.

52:26.390 --> 52:28.892
You're, like,
exactly the same.

52:28.925 --> 52:29.893
Which is so amazing

52:29.926 --> 52:32.530
considering everything
you've been through.

52:32.563 --> 52:34.165
You know?

52:36.567 --> 52:37.968
Thanks.

52:39.537 --> 52:41.138
Kris, come on!

52:41.172 --> 52:43.107
Come on, do you wanna
go play beer pong?

52:45.309 --> 52:47.877
Your brother says
you're the champ.

52:47.911 --> 52:49.813
I'm not anymore.

52:54.585 --> 52:57.255
Sorry, bro!

53:08.599 --> 53:10.033
Hello?

53:10.066 --> 53:12.203
Kate?

53:12.236 --> 53:13.304
Yeah?

53:13.337 --> 53:14.971
It's Laura.

53:19.277 --> 53:20.411
It's late.

53:20.444 --> 53:22.979
Yeah, I know.

53:25.316 --> 53:27.917
How was the party?

53:27.951 --> 53:29.819
Okay, I guess.

53:32.223 --> 53:34.158
Have you been drinking?

53:35.259 --> 53:36.926
A little.

53:40.231 --> 53:42.133
Are you home?

53:42.166 --> 53:43.900
Yeah.

53:43.933 --> 53:46.870
Where's Steve?

53:46.903 --> 53:49.273
He's here.

53:49.307 --> 53:51.375
Passed out, I guess.

53:54.010 --> 53:55.879
Do you need something?

54:01.585 --> 54:03.920
Yeah.

54:03.953 --> 54:05.855
You.

55:13.190 --> 55:14.358
Hey.

55:16.394 --> 55:17.927
Hey.

55:17.961 --> 55:19.996
You came.

55:20.029 --> 55:23.066
I didn't know if you would,
'cause you're not working.

55:23.100 --> 55:25.202
Of course I would.

55:27.971 --> 55:29.640
Come here.

55:39.250 --> 55:41.218
There were a lot
of people here tonight.

55:42.386 --> 55:44.221
There still are.

55:49.627 --> 55:52.496
Steve brought over this girl.

55:52.530 --> 55:54.565
He wanted me to meet her.

55:56.634 --> 55:59.403
She was pretty.

55:59.437 --> 56:01.605
She had a nice smile.

56:03.774 --> 56:05.074
That's good.

56:06.177 --> 56:07.411
No.

56:07.445 --> 56:09.012
No, it's not good.

56:09.045 --> 56:13.617
It's not good,
because everything is...

56:13.651 --> 56:16.052
it's just all
so different now.

56:18.489 --> 56:21.592
It's so different now,
and I can't explain it.

56:25.296 --> 56:28.732
All I kept thinking about

56:28.766 --> 56:31.135
was I wanted you here.

56:39.176 --> 56:40.744
You're drunk.

56:43.481 --> 56:45.416
Maybe a little.

56:49.286 --> 56:52.323
It's okay if you don't
feel the same way,

56:52.356 --> 56:54.492
but I had to tell you.

56:57.228 --> 57:00.029
It's okay,
'cause I know I'm broken.

58:24.815 --> 58:26.717
- Kate.
- Oh.

58:26.750 --> 58:28.385
What are you doing here?

58:28.419 --> 58:30.688
Your sister called me
last night.

58:30.721 --> 58:32.456
I wanted to make sure
she was okay.

58:32.489 --> 58:34.191
Well, she is, right?

58:35.459 --> 58:37.428
I think so.

58:42.499 --> 58:43.667
All right, well,
I've gotta get

58:43.701 --> 58:45.235
these people out of here.

58:45.269 --> 58:46.670
I got called in to work.

58:49.306 --> 58:50.507
Can you look after her
for a while?

58:52.343 --> 58:53.611
Sure.

59:00.517 --> 59:01.552
Thanks.

59:36.954 --> 59:38.555
I'm a mess.

59:59.476 --> 01:00:00.377
You good?

01:00:04.815 --> 01:00:05.683
Okay.

01:00:33.711 --> 01:00:34.945
Kate?

01:00:34.978 --> 01:00:36.847
Can you come in here again?

01:00:45.723 --> 01:00:47.658
I dropped my brush.

01:00:47.691 --> 01:00:49.860
Can you get it for me?

01:01:01.338 --> 01:01:02.506
Thanks.

01:01:15.986 --> 01:01:18.622
Do you remember
what you said last night?

01:02:14.511 --> 01:02:15.979
Is this okay?

01:02:16.013 --> 01:02:17.714
Yeah.

01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:20.811
It's been...

01:03:21.645 --> 01:03:23.081
Me too.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.809
It's okay.

01:04:25.842 --> 01:04:27.978
You're not gonna hurt me.

01:05:17.861 --> 01:05:18.695
Mhm.

01:06:32.002 --> 01:06:33.070
Hi!

01:06:33.104 --> 01:06:35.139
Oh, my boy!

01:06:35.173 --> 01:06:36.807
Hi, Grandma!

01:06:39.042 --> 01:06:40.644
How's your face?

01:06:40.677 --> 01:06:41.379
Better, Grandma!

01:06:41.412 --> 01:06:42.712
Oh.

01:06:44.047 --> 01:06:45.183
Thank God.

01:06:49.853 --> 01:06:51.289
Sorry we didn't call first.

01:06:51.322 --> 01:06:52.856
No, no, it's all right.

01:06:52.889 --> 01:06:54.258
How's everything?

01:06:54.292 --> 01:06:55.259
Everything's...

01:07:00.098 --> 01:07:02.766
Yeah, well,
I'm really happy to see you.

01:07:04.701 --> 01:07:05.836
Come in.

01:07:05.869 --> 01:07:08.406
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

01:07:08.439 --> 01:07:10.174
Tea? Would you like a drink?

01:07:10.208 --> 01:07:11.908
Oh, no, no, thanks.

01:07:11.942 --> 01:07:13.743
We can't stay long.

01:07:13.777 --> 01:07:15.879
Can I go, Mom? Can I go?

01:07:15.912 --> 01:07:17.013
Okay.

01:07:17.047 --> 01:07:19.983
Here, you run out
to the car

01:07:20.016 --> 01:07:21.952
and I will be there in sec.

01:07:30.261 --> 01:07:31.229
Is he okay?

01:07:31.262 --> 01:07:32.363
Yeah.

01:07:35.932 --> 01:07:39.069
I'm sorry about Jack.

01:07:39.103 --> 01:07:41.139
Yeah, me too.

01:07:41.172 --> 01:07:42.706
I tell him all the time

01:07:42.739 --> 01:07:45.008
you're Brady's
only grandmother.

01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:48.179
We need to get along
for Brady's sake,

01:07:48.212 --> 01:07:51.115
but he won't listen.

01:07:51.149 --> 01:07:53.217
Not to me, anyway.

01:07:55.952 --> 01:07:57.321
Jack is gonna be
furious at me

01:07:57.355 --> 01:08:01.057
for coming here today,
but I just don't care.

01:08:01.092 --> 01:08:02.893
Brady loves you.

01:08:02.926 --> 01:08:05.196
And if Jack
doesn't like that,

01:08:05.229 --> 01:08:07.298
then that's just too bad.

01:08:10.033 --> 01:08:12.136
We all carry stuff, Kate.

01:08:14.838 --> 01:08:15.939
Can we come in now, Mom?

01:08:15.972 --> 01:08:18.309
- Can we come in?
- Yes, my love!

01:08:18.341 --> 01:08:20.243
She's for you, Grandma!

01:08:20.278 --> 01:08:21.745
Isn't she cute?

01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:28.852
What are you gonna name her?

01:08:28.885 --> 01:08:30.087
I don't know!

01:08:30.121 --> 01:08:34.125
How about Peanut Butter?

01:08:34.158 --> 01:08:37.428
She looks like peanut butter
and you eat it all the time.

01:08:37.461 --> 01:08:39.229
I do.

01:08:59.983 --> 01:09:02.153
Katherine,
it's Stephanie Marx.

01:09:02.185 --> 01:09:04.154
You need to be in my office
first thing tomorrow,

01:09:04.188 --> 01:09:05.822
9 A.M. sharp.

01:09:05.854 --> 01:09:07.057
You are not to see
any patients

01:09:07.091 --> 01:09:08.959
from this point forward.

01:09:08.992 --> 01:09:10.194
If you're unable
to keep this appointment,

01:09:10.228 --> 01:09:12.229
you must call my office
immediately.

01:09:12.263 --> 01:09:13.331
See you in the morning.

01:09:35.118 --> 01:09:36.987
- Hello.
- Hi!

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:41.158
You going somewhere?

01:09:41.192 --> 01:09:44.161
I thought you had PT.

01:09:44.194 --> 01:09:45.895
I do.

01:09:45.929 --> 01:09:47.564
But I'm not doing it.

01:09:47.598 --> 01:09:48.798
Oh.

01:09:48.832 --> 01:09:50.334
I don't want to go to PT,

01:09:50.368 --> 01:09:52.868
I don't want to go
to the orthopedist.

01:09:52.902 --> 01:09:55.172
I don't want to be
a patient today.

01:09:57.007 --> 01:09:59.075
I just wanna get out of here.

01:10:01.077 --> 01:10:01.945
With me?

01:10:03.447 --> 01:10:05.915
Yeah, with you.

01:10:05.949 --> 01:10:07.485
All right, I'm just
gonna turn you around.

01:10:07.518 --> 01:10:08.985
- Okay.
- A little tight right there,

01:10:09.019 --> 01:10:10.187
- just...
- It's okay.

01:10:10.221 --> 01:10:11.355
Be careful.

01:10:11.389 --> 01:10:12.922
And close the door.

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:18.195
It's a little tight.

01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:20.164
It's fine.

01:10:23.301 --> 01:10:25.436
This... this is it.

01:10:25.469 --> 01:10:27.238
It's sweet.

01:10:27.271 --> 01:10:31.007
I don't own it,
it's just a rental.

01:10:32.042 --> 01:10:33.877
You have a lot of plants.

01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:35.011
Yeah.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:37.881
What are they?

01:10:37.914 --> 01:10:38.982
Um...

01:10:40.418 --> 01:10:44.355
Well, this... this one
is a peace lily.

01:10:44.388 --> 01:10:46.257
Oh.

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:50.528
And a spider plant.

01:10:50.561 --> 01:10:52.129
Philodendron,

01:10:52.163 --> 01:10:55.099
and there's another
philodendron here.

01:10:55.132 --> 01:10:57.301
Their... their leaves
are heart-shaped.

01:10:57.335 --> 01:10:59.470
Why do you like plants
so much?

01:10:59.503 --> 01:11:03.907
We need them to breathe,
and they need us, I guess.

01:11:07.311 --> 01:11:09.447
It's a perfect exchange.

01:11:13.150 --> 01:11:14.352
Yeah.

01:11:23.127 --> 01:11:25.329
Oh, is this your cat?

01:11:25.363 --> 01:11:26.430
Yeah.

01:11:26.464 --> 01:11:28.632
That's MK.

01:11:28.666 --> 01:11:31.669
And that's...
that's Jack holding her.

01:11:31.702 --> 01:11:33.170
He must have been
like 15 there.

01:11:33.204 --> 01:11:35.272
Aw. Hi, MK!

01:11:37.475 --> 01:11:39.343
These are my parents,

01:11:39.377 --> 01:11:42.646
- and that's my brother.
- Hm!

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.248
And where does he live?

01:11:44.281 --> 01:11:47.351
Uh, Portland, I think?

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.454
Portland?

01:11:50.488 --> 01:11:51.389
Yeah.

01:11:51.422 --> 01:11:54.592
He moved as far away from me
as he could.

01:11:58.562 --> 01:12:01.165
Portland.

01:12:01.198 --> 01:12:03.401
Yeah, that is pretty far.

01:12:03.434 --> 01:12:04.934
Yeah.

01:12:13.544 --> 01:12:15.312
I want to show you something.

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:23.421
Aww!

01:12:26.123 --> 01:12:29.627
Aren't you the cutest!

01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:31.629
Oh, my gosh,
I could just eat you up,

01:12:31.662 --> 01:12:33.230
Peanut Butter!

01:12:33.264 --> 01:12:34.698
Hi!

01:12:36.233 --> 01:12:37.735
What's going on, cutie?

01:12:37.768 --> 01:12:39.537
Huh? Hi!

01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:41.605
Aw, hi, yeah!

01:12:41.639 --> 01:12:43.474
Oh, my gosh.

01:12:45.376 --> 01:12:47.578
He's gonna be so mad at me.

01:12:49.647 --> 01:12:52.048
I can only imagine
what he's thinking.

01:12:52.082 --> 01:12:53.617
That you pushed me
down a flight of stairs.

01:12:53.651 --> 01:12:55.352
Stop it!

01:12:55.386 --> 01:12:58.122
Left me on some
railroad tracks somewhere.

01:13:01.091 --> 01:13:02.560
You're having
your way with me

01:13:02.593 --> 01:13:05.262
in some seedy handicap stall?

01:13:13.471 --> 01:13:16.207
I should really get you home.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:19.743
It's getting late
and he's very...

01:13:19.777 --> 01:13:20.977
What?

01:13:24.181 --> 01:13:25.783
He's very...

01:13:25.816 --> 01:13:27.251
Protective?

01:13:28.519 --> 01:13:29.753
Yeah.

01:13:32.223 --> 01:13:35.058
He just doesn't want me
to get hurt anymore.

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:45.202
We shouldn't do this.

01:13:47.137 --> 01:13:50.107
I never got to kiss you.

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:51.242
I really want to kiss you.

01:14:17.301 --> 01:14:19.203
- You think?
- Mhm, definitely.

01:14:19.236 --> 01:14:21.572
- Hey!
- Where have you two been?

01:14:21.605 --> 01:14:22.606
We went out for a drive.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.475
Stephanie called.

01:14:25.309 --> 01:14:26.343
Oh, yeah?

01:14:26.377 --> 01:14:27.411
She said if you show up here,

01:14:27.444 --> 01:14:29.647
I should call her
immediately.

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.815
- Why's that?
- You tell me.

01:14:31.849 --> 01:14:33.150
Steve, what are you doing?

01:14:33.183 --> 01:14:34.351
Why are you talking
to her like that?

01:14:34.385 --> 01:14:35.786
'Cause something's up.

01:14:37.454 --> 01:14:38.789
What is it, Kate?

01:14:38.822 --> 01:14:40.624
Uh...

01:14:40.658 --> 01:14:43.294
I'm sure it's nothing,
I'll call her tomorrow.

01:14:43.327 --> 01:14:45.696
Well, maybe
I should call her now.

01:14:45.729 --> 01:14:46.830
Whatever you want.

01:14:46.864 --> 01:14:48.399
Is that what you want?

01:14:48.432 --> 01:14:50.267
'Cause I will. I'll pick up
the phone right now.

01:14:50.301 --> 01:14:51.669
Steve, enough, okay?

01:14:51.702 --> 01:14:53.537
It's her boss,
she'll deal with it.

01:14:53.571 --> 01:14:55.205
Just leave her alone.

01:15:03.681 --> 01:15:05.215
I'm sorry about that.

01:15:05.249 --> 01:15:06.483
That's all right.

01:15:06.517 --> 01:15:08.252
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:10.754
All right.

01:15:10.788 --> 01:15:12.389
Well, I've gotta go
get ready for Billy,

01:15:12.423 --> 01:15:14.725
- so...
- Okay.

01:15:25.302 --> 01:15:27.137
I am finally cured!

01:15:27.171 --> 01:15:30.608
Hallelujah, I never have
to see this guy again.

01:15:30.641 --> 01:15:32.309
She says that now,
but she secretly loves me.

01:15:32.343 --> 01:15:34.511
- I do, actually.
- I know you do.

01:15:34.545 --> 01:15:35.813
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

01:15:35.846 --> 01:15:38.115
- Not really.
- Yeah, right.

01:15:39.383 --> 01:15:40.351
Are you going home?

01:15:42.886 --> 01:15:43.721
I am.

01:15:45.356 --> 01:15:49.860
Um, I thought
we were gonna get dinner.

01:15:49.893 --> 01:15:51.362
I'm not feeling up to it.

01:15:52.863 --> 01:15:54.832
Okay, can I call you later?

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.434
Yeah.

01:16:02.272 --> 01:16:04.174
Come on, got one more paper
to sign, girl.

01:16:04.208 --> 01:16:06.644
One more.

01:16:06.677 --> 01:16:07.878
Fine.

01:16:07.911 --> 01:16:08.879
Don't hurt yourself now.

01:16:08.912 --> 01:16:10.314
I won't.

01:16:10.347 --> 01:16:11.649
Good to see you.

01:16:11.682 --> 01:16:14.785
Come on in, she's gonna
be out in just a moment.

01:16:14.818 --> 01:16:16.620
Sure.

01:16:21.825 --> 01:16:23.360
Katherine Murphy?

01:16:24.828 --> 01:16:27.531
- Yeah.
- I need you to come with me.

01:16:27.564 --> 01:16:29.366
- What's going on?
- She's getting arrested.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.669
- What?
- She's a fucking skell, Laura.

01:16:31.702 --> 01:16:32.803
What are you talking about?

01:16:32.836 --> 01:16:33.837
You remember
that Black chick

01:16:33.871 --> 01:16:35.239
I thought
took money from us?

01:16:35.272 --> 01:16:36.907
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, it wasn't her.

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.442
It was this piece of trash.

01:16:38.475 --> 01:16:39.510
They've been tracking her.

01:16:39.543 --> 01:16:40.611
Come on,
let's go, Katherine.

01:16:40.644 --> 01:16:43.914
You fuck a paraplegic
and then you steal from her?

01:16:43.947 --> 01:16:45.215
Get the fuck off me, man!

01:16:45.249 --> 01:16:46.517
Don't do that to me, man.

01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:47.718
I hope you feel good
about yourself!

01:16:47.751 --> 01:16:49.353
She trusted you,
you piece of shit!

01:16:49.386 --> 01:16:50.654
- Steve!
- Get her out of here!

01:16:50.688 --> 01:16:51.822
- Steve!
- Get her out of here!

01:16:51.855 --> 01:16:53.290
- Steve, relax!
- Get her out of here!

01:16:53.323 --> 01:16:55.559
Kate! Kate!

01:17:16.714 --> 01:17:18.649
Murphy, your ride's here.

01:17:42.473 --> 01:17:43.774
Please don't tell Jack.

01:17:47.845 --> 01:17:49.513
Or Brady.

01:18:40.831 --> 01:18:42.699
Fuck.

01:18:42.733 --> 01:18:44.935
Oh.

01:18:44.968 --> 01:18:46.470
- Oh.
- Let's go, man.

01:18:46.503 --> 01:18:47.538
Out of the car.

01:18:47.571 --> 01:18:49.873
You too, lady,
out of the car.

01:18:49.907 --> 01:18:51.074
Fuck.

01:19:13.931 --> 01:19:15.133
Who is it?

01:19:15.166 --> 01:19:16.767
It's Jack.

01:19:21.705 --> 01:19:23.707
What's going on?

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:24.808
Can I stay here?

01:19:24.842 --> 01:19:26.710
I can't go home.

01:19:47.431 --> 01:19:48.832
It'll be okay.

01:20:41.051 --> 01:20:42.886
Jack, I'll see you later!

01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:48.692
Hey, Liz, it's me again.

01:20:48.725 --> 01:20:51.129
Look, I really need
to talk to my son.

01:20:51.162 --> 01:20:53.830
I've never gone this long
without...

01:20:55.999 --> 01:20:58.869
And it really sucks, okay?

01:20:58.902 --> 01:21:01.004
So I know you don't want
to talk to me,

01:21:01.038 --> 01:21:03.573
but you have to let me
talk to Brady, okay?

01:21:05.776 --> 01:21:07.878
Sorry.

01:21:10.181 --> 01:21:14.152
Just don't keep him
from me, please.

01:21:15.986 --> 01:21:18.522
Call me back.

01:21:18.555 --> 01:21:19.923
Please.

01:21:24.661 --> 01:21:25.629
Fuck.

01:21:57.095 --> 01:21:59.062
You'll be working with Brenda
the next few days.

01:21:59.097 --> 01:22:01.299
We'll see how you do.

01:22:01.332 --> 01:22:02.733
You've gotta be
quick on your feet.

01:22:02.766 --> 01:22:04.835
Are you quick on your feet?

01:22:04.868 --> 01:22:06.837
- I am.
- Especially the morning rush.

01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:08.038
Can't be a sloth.

01:22:09.207 --> 01:22:11.142
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:23:21.145 --> 01:23:22.113
Come on in.

01:23:35.992 --> 01:23:37.627
Is he safe?

01:23:43.301 --> 01:23:46.204
Did he...

01:23:46.237 --> 01:23:48.705
tell you what he...

01:23:48.738 --> 01:23:50.108
No.

01:23:54.778 --> 01:23:56.247
Where's Brady?

01:23:59.217 --> 01:24:01.785
He's at my sister's.

01:24:01.818 --> 01:24:03.287
Oh.

01:24:08.292 --> 01:24:14.030
Liz, I've made
a lot of mistakes.

01:24:16.367 --> 01:24:22.106
And I... I have been trying
really hard

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.275
to do the right thing,

01:24:24.308 --> 01:24:27.944
but it seems like
I still just...

01:24:27.978 --> 01:24:29.913
I still can't get it right.

01:24:29.946 --> 01:24:31.982
Stealing is never right.

01:24:35.919 --> 01:24:38.089
My cat was dying.

01:24:40.124 --> 01:24:42.093
Cats die, Kate.

01:24:46.963 --> 01:24:48.299
Yeah.

01:24:50.033 --> 01:24:52.103
I guess they do.

01:24:55.439 --> 01:24:57.741
Liz, I don't know
what happened.

01:24:59.477 --> 01:25:01.745
But whatever it is,
please, please don't...

01:25:01.778 --> 01:25:03.447
don't blame Jack, blame me.

01:25:03.481 --> 01:25:05.249
He is who he is
because of me,

01:25:05.283 --> 01:25:07.851
I'm his mother
and I have failed him

01:25:07.884 --> 01:25:09.920
over and over again.

01:25:12.323 --> 01:25:14.292
And he needs you.

01:25:17.428 --> 01:25:21.064
And he needs Brady
and Brady needs him.

01:25:21.098 --> 01:25:22.500
So please, Liz,
whatever you do,

01:25:22.533 --> 01:25:26.237
please don't take Brady
away from him.

01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:27.771
It will destroy him.

01:25:31.442 --> 01:25:33.244
And it will destroy us.

01:25:41.985 --> 01:25:44.054
Still learning, Liz.

01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:48.825
We're both still learning.

01:26:35.539 --> 01:26:37.841
Want some crackers?

01:26:37.874 --> 01:26:40.076
Yeah.

01:26:40.111 --> 01:26:42.580
Do you have
those little square ones?

01:26:42.613 --> 01:26:43.780
Yeah.

01:26:44.948 --> 01:26:46.317
I got 'em.

01:27:04.101 --> 01:27:05.503
Thanks.

01:27:30.127 --> 01:27:30.994
Kate, you're up!

01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:34.898
- Thanks, Barry.
- You're welcome.

01:27:46.644 --> 01:27:48.312
- You all set?
- Yes.

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:50.147
- You want anything else?
- Just the check.

01:27:50.181 --> 01:27:52.483
Okay, sure.

01:27:52.516 --> 01:27:54.185
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:28:36.227 --> 01:28:37.261
Sir, sir!

01:28:37.294 --> 01:28:38.362
Sir, sir!

01:28:38.396 --> 01:28:40.664
Sir, sir, sir.

01:28:42.466 --> 01:28:44.235
I was your waitress
at the diner,

01:28:44.268 --> 01:28:46.069
and you left... you left that.

01:28:46.103 --> 01:28:46.970
Thank you so much!

01:28:47.003 --> 01:28:49.707
- You're welcome.
- I left my wallet!

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:52.041
Geez.

01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:13.657
Jack?

01:30:15.092 --> 01:30:16.527
Jack, you home?

01:30:18.796 --> 01:30:20.164
- Mom?
- Yeah?

01:30:24.301 --> 01:30:27.738
Why'd you keep
that bottle of whiskey?

01:30:30.274 --> 01:30:32.743
Patient gave it to me
for Christmas.

01:30:34.512 --> 01:30:36.180
Why'd you keep it then?

01:30:36.213 --> 01:30:38.047
Why didn't you throw it out?

01:30:38.082 --> 01:30:39.817
It was a reminder.

01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:46.524
That you're an alcoholic
and you shouldn't drink?

01:30:46.557 --> 01:30:49.058
Of my patient.

01:31:00.504 --> 01:31:02.306
Table five needs you.

01:31:02.339 --> 01:31:04.108
Okay, thanks.

01:31:32.703 --> 01:31:33.671
Hi.

01:31:35.472 --> 01:31:37.207
How was work?

01:31:37.241 --> 01:31:39.310
Busy, my feet hurt.

01:31:40.844 --> 01:31:42.780
You weren't a sloth,
were you?

01:31:42.813 --> 01:31:44.682
I was not a sloth.

01:31:46.283 --> 01:31:47.551
What are you doing?

01:31:47.585 --> 01:31:49.787
I, uh...

01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:53.657
I don't want you
to lose this spot.

01:31:53.691 --> 01:31:56.126
The grass grows
so fast back here.

01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.795
I didn't want you
to forget where she was.

01:32:00.197 --> 01:32:02.099
That's a good idea.

01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:07.671
Hey, I'll take care
of the grass and stuff

01:32:07.705 --> 01:32:08.539
while I'm here.

01:32:08.572 --> 01:32:10.608
I don't want you
to worry about it.

01:32:12.476 --> 01:32:14.144
Go for it.

01:32:21.752 --> 01:32:22.820
You want to do it again?

01:32:22.853 --> 01:32:24.321
Mhm. Let's play it again.

01:32:24.355 --> 01:32:27.157
Let's play again, all right.

01:32:27.191 --> 01:32:28.125
Let's see.

01:32:29.426 --> 01:32:31.328
Let's see.

01:32:31.362 --> 01:32:34.431
So, what do you have?

01:32:34.465 --> 01:32:35.766
Two eights.

01:32:35.799 --> 01:32:38.636
And? That's two points.

01:32:38.669 --> 01:32:39.937
- And what else?
- Two fives!

01:32:39.970 --> 01:32:42.673
Two fives,
that's another two points.

01:32:42.706 --> 01:32:45.743
- So two plus two is?
- Four!

01:32:48.312 --> 01:32:50.648
You got it.
Now go check your crib.

01:32:54.518 --> 01:32:56.553
What do you have?

01:32:56.587 --> 01:32:58.722
- Eight and five!
- Oh, no!

01:32:58.756 --> 01:33:00.524
I can't believe it!

01:33:00.557 --> 01:33:02.793
Oh, Peanut Butter,
he's so smart.

01:33:16.473 --> 01:33:17.808
What are you doing here?

01:33:20.511 --> 01:33:22.513
I don't want
to cause any problems,

01:33:22.546 --> 01:33:24.448
I just wanted
to pay you back.

01:33:28.919 --> 01:33:30.854
Think that's gonna make it
all go away?

01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:33.791
No.

01:33:54.545 --> 01:33:55.312
Do you have any idea

01:33:55.345 --> 01:33:57.715
what my sister
has been through?

01:33:57.748 --> 01:33:59.416
Huh?

01:33:59.450 --> 01:34:00.551
The pain?

01:34:01.752 --> 01:34:03.554
The loss?

01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:09.693
And how she fights to get
through every fucking day?

01:34:09.727 --> 01:34:12.596
Do you know what that's like?

01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:14.398
- Hmm?
- Not exactly.

01:34:17.568 --> 01:34:19.970
And then you come here
to help.

01:34:24.708 --> 01:34:26.310
How do you sleep
at night, Kate?

01:34:33.951 --> 01:34:37.254
So, nah, I don't want
anything from you.

01:34:39.423 --> 01:34:41.892
Got no use for you.

01:34:41.925 --> 01:34:44.294
Just leave my sister alone.

01:34:45.395 --> 01:34:46.930
All right?

01:34:52.069 --> 01:34:54.371
Get the fuck off my property.

01:36:39.776 --> 01:36:41.545
How'd you find me?

01:36:43.013 --> 01:36:45.716
I went by your house.

01:36:45.749 --> 01:36:47.818
Brady told me
where you'd be.

01:36:49.987 --> 01:36:51.722
He's living with you now?

01:36:53.523 --> 01:36:54.658
Jack is.

01:36:54.691 --> 01:36:56.526
Brady's just visiting.

01:36:58.795 --> 01:37:00.530
Lots of changes.

01:37:01.965 --> 01:37:03.500
Oh, yeah.

01:37:09.173 --> 01:37:10.941
I would've given you
the money, Kate.

01:37:12.509 --> 01:37:14.044
If you would've just asked.

01:37:15.679 --> 01:37:18.582
I so wish
you would have asked.

01:37:22.253 --> 01:37:24.188
I didn't know I could.

01:37:28.892 --> 01:37:31.162
I don't know the rules.

01:37:55.852 --> 01:37:57.688
I can help you with that.

01:38:10.134 --> 01:38:13.237
My father taught us
from a very young age

01:38:13.271 --> 01:38:15.739
there's good and bad
in the world.

01:38:18.775 --> 01:38:22.579
And that people
are either one or the other.

01:38:24.681 --> 01:38:26.516
It was that simple.

01:38:29.052 --> 01:38:33.291
"Makes it easier," he said,

01:38:33.324 --> 01:38:35.759
"especially with our job."

01:38:39.197 --> 01:38:40.998
But I'd think...

01:38:42.966 --> 01:38:44.568
...so much...

01:38:50.174 --> 01:38:53.610
Like that nurse, remember?

01:38:53.643 --> 01:38:56.046
The one who killed
some of his patients?

01:38:59.183 --> 01:39:02.153
He was president
of his nursing class.

01:39:02.186 --> 01:39:04.921
Did you know that?

01:39:04.955 --> 01:39:08.792
And he was a nurse
for 16 years.

01:39:08.825 --> 01:39:10.761
All different hospitals.

01:39:12.863 --> 01:39:16.600
He had to do some good, right?

01:39:16.633 --> 01:39:18.702
And he had
to have helped people.

01:39:21.938 --> 01:39:25.209
Because 16 years
is a long time.

01:39:28.279 --> 01:39:30.080
He had to.

01:40:26.204 --> 01:40:28.738
You little rascal!

01:40:32.343 --> 01:40:34.245
Come on, let's go in the water.

01:40:58.721 --> 01:41:03.721
