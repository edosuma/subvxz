WEBVTT

00:21.397 --> 00:23.023
Yeah?

00:24.817 --> 00:26.193
I knew you'd be up.

00:26.235 --> 00:27.778
I remember how you were
with the big cases.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.572
Tired?

00:29.613 --> 00:31.407
Forgot how it feels, though.

00:31.449 --> 00:34.660
That rush you get when the case
starts to come alive.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.121
I thought
you were just an asset.

00:37.163 --> 00:40.082
Minor recon for the Feds.

00:40.124 --> 00:42.501
Come on,
don't spoil my high, Harry.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.628
I'm back in the hunt.
I've missed it.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.381
-Just don't let them
string you along. -Really?

00:47.423 --> 00:49.717
That's all you got for me?
Sorry I called.

00:49.759 --> 00:52.386
I heard
you and Maddie got into it.

00:52.428 --> 00:55.222
She's 18, and I'm her mother.

00:55.264 --> 00:57.266
Oh, I think there's
a little more to it than that.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.440
Eleanor?

01:10.070 --> 01:13.115
-Eleanor

01:13.157 --> 01:15.242
Just shoot straight with her.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.453
I will.

01:17.495 --> 01:18.829
I am.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.630
I got to go, Harry.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.673
Okay. Have a better one.

01:31.884 --> 01:34.220
Jesus Christ.

02:50.254 --> 02:52.923
- -

02:52.965 --> 02:54.174
- -

02:58.387 --> 02:59.638
- -

03:26.707 --> 03:28.375
- -

03:28.417 --> 03:30.127
Bitch.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.393
Are you using the Jeep today?

03:46.435 --> 03:50.189
-Nope. Taking my city ride.
-Mom's hounding me

03:50.230 --> 03:54.026
to finish all that bank trust
whatever paperwork.

03:54.068 --> 03:57.863
I'll probably stay
at her place tonight.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.491
What's going on with the phone?

04:00.532 --> 04:02.409
Trolls.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.119
Trolls?

04:04.161 --> 04:06.413
I'll make you breakfast.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.082
Egg whites. Protein.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.125
I'm good.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.382
Were you here for the riots?

04:16.423 --> 04:17.800
Yeah.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.802
I was a street cop on Wilshire.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.887
25 year anniversary
or something.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.597
We've been talking about them
at my school.

04:25.057 --> 04:28.018
City's changed a lot
since back then.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.728
Better or worse?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.397
Both.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.358
But back to the elves
in your phone.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.859
What's that about?

04:35.901 --> 04:38.654
Sometimes,
when your name's in the news,

04:38.696 --> 04:41.865
people blow up my accounts
with stupid anti-cop stuff.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.701
-Like what?
-It's no big deal.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.160
I just block them.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.704
People you know?

04:46.745 --> 04:48.706
Dad, obviously not.

04:48.747 --> 04:52.209
I'm sorry you have to deal
with that.

04:52.251 --> 04:55.295
It's easier than dealing
with the real thing out there.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.007
Your old man's
one smart Indian, Mads.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.633
You don't need to worry
about me.

04:59.675 --> 05:02.344
I don't. Much.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.764
Still need to eat breakfast.

05:55.314 --> 05:58.358
Lost his head over a woman.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.152
With a tactical knife

06:00.194 --> 06:01.945
in her Kate Spade bag.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.656
Mmm. Still. ClichÃ©.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.034
Well...

06:07.076 --> 06:08.535
Troubles?

06:08.577 --> 06:09.828
I think I broke it.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.372
We can only hope.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.419
You're early.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.964
Pierce, right?

07:02.005 --> 07:04.758
-Terry Drake.
-I know.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.594
The other RHD guys
are coming in later.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.763
Jimmy thought
to get you out of here first.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.598
30.
-Yeah.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.143
Shit. My bad.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.727
It's banker's hours.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.814
This cat used to be
in here hitting it by 0600.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.649
I can't park you in here,
but let's go grab a cup

07:20.691 --> 07:21.942
of coffee while you wait.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.944
Uh... You know what?

07:23.986 --> 07:26.155
I'm good.
I'm good, brother.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.115
I, um... I got
some errands to run.

07:28.157 --> 07:31.535
And, uh, just tell Santiago
that, uh...

07:31.577 --> 07:32.953
I'll circle back.

08:37.476 --> 08:39.436
You the cop?

08:39.478 --> 08:41.313
I am.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.523
Leave it here.

08:43.565 --> 08:44.942
I'll walk you in.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.876
I'm not likely to give you
more than five minutes.

09:02.918 --> 09:06.255
Sorry to intrude.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.549
Forgive me for not wanting
to participate in the charade

09:09.591 --> 09:11.551
that the Los Angeles
Police Department

09:11.593 --> 09:13.512
gives a damn about my husband.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.180
I do.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.307
-If there's a better time,
I can come back... -No.

09:17.349 --> 09:20.143
Ask and go.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.398
Threats

09:24.439 --> 09:26.650
Anyone he was at odds with?

09:26.692 --> 09:28.902
Besides you cops?

09:30.445 --> 09:32.739
It was his job...

09:32.781 --> 09:35.534
to be at odds with
the whole world, if need be.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.745
How often did he stay
at the Bunker Hill place?

09:38.787 --> 09:40.831
Always...

09:40.872 --> 09:43.458
as trials got close.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.961
That's why I wasn't
expecting him.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.716
We took some photos
in the apartment.

09:50.757 --> 09:55.929
Tell me if you see anything
out of place or unfamiliar.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.068
You expect me to pretend
I don't know about

10:10.110 --> 10:11.611
his jury consultant?

10:11.653 --> 10:14.239
It wasn't her
who killed him, either.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.992
She liked sleeping
with him too much.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.954
-Your son inside?
-No.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.622
Maybe later.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.624
He has his own place.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.501
Stay away from him.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.878
Mrs. Elias,
I need to do my job.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.379
You need to look
at who would most benefit

10:29.421 --> 10:33.216
from my husband's death,
Detective.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.885
You need to look
at your own people

10:34.926 --> 10:37.554
before you go throwing
accusations around about mine.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.890
I am.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.683
I am looking at everyone.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.602
Why do I find that
so hard to believe?

10:43.643 --> 10:47.731
Whether you do or you don't,
my job's the same.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.319
Terry Drake.

10:52.361 --> 10:53.987
What about him?

10:54.029 --> 10:56.490
Well, Drake and my husband had
more than one run-in,

10:56.531 --> 10:58.909
back when Howard was
in the DA's office.

11:00.577 --> 11:05.248
This one time, Howard refused
to file a case,

11:05.290 --> 11:07.584
and Drake went ballistic.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.127
He got one of his patrol buddies

11:09.169 --> 11:12.881
to pull Howard over
for driving while black.

11:12.923 --> 11:15.133
You know.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.843
Did your husband
ever report this?

11:16.885 --> 11:19.221
No. He quit.

11:19.262 --> 11:22.557
He went over to the dark side.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.643
Isn't that what you call it?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.145
I don't call it anything.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.065
Jen, how are you?

11:30.107 --> 11:32.067
I have a houseful, so...

11:32.109 --> 11:33.610
Of course.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.697
If you think of anything.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.620
Again, my condolences.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.916
Stay away from my boy.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.687
In the wake
of the murder of attorney

12:08.728 --> 12:11.898
Howard Elias, no word yet
on how or even if

12:11.940 --> 12:14.734
the Black Guardian civil rights
case against the LAPD

12:14.776 --> 12:16.736
will proceed.
Meanwhile,

12:16.778 --> 12:19.322
The L.A. Times' Scott Anderson,
in today's onl...

12:29.666 --> 12:32.919
Know what I like
about the L.A. River?

12:32.961 --> 12:34.963
Not a damn thing.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.719
You look like shit.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.721
How long they keep you?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.764
Oh, I'm not going until later.

12:46.224 --> 12:47.893
Wait a minute,
you're blowing 'em off?

12:47.934 --> 12:50.729
No, no, no, no. Relax, relax.
Listen, you go in,

12:50.770 --> 12:53.398
you talk to 'em, and then I'll
go in and lock everything down.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.942
I'm not talking to anybody.
It's all bullshit.

12:55.984 --> 12:59.696
They're-they're only looking
at us because of Black Guardian.

12:59.738 --> 13:02.949
Now, we would do the same thing
if it was them.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.996
Frankie doesn't have an alibi.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.458
I thought you were out drinking.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.877
I was at home.

13:13.919 --> 13:15.545
Alone.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.880
Drunk.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.507
Jesus.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.383
I could say that he was with me.

13:20.425 --> 13:23.094
Even if Jimmy
let that slip, uh...

13:23.136 --> 13:25.639
-Harry Bosch would blow that
straight up. -Fucked.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.724
-No. -I'm fucked. They're gonna
fuckin' nail me on this.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.351
They're gonna
fuckin' hang it on me.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.396
Hey, Rooker?

13:33.438 --> 13:35.524
Let me have a word
with my man here.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.779
I'm screwed, dude.

13:48.119 --> 13:51.790
Elias refused a settlement
on Friday night.

13:51.831 --> 13:55.252
Any reason that he should be
so confident all of a sudden?

13:56.503 --> 13:57.712
The fuck would I know?

13:57.754 --> 13:59.339
You didn't do it.

13:59.381 --> 14:01.383
I didn't do it?

14:03.426 --> 14:04.886
Fuckin' kidding me?

14:04.928 --> 14:06.596
You know I didn't do it.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.266
Yeah. So you just go in there,
you-you tell the truth.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.268
Where you got the booze,
when you got home,

14:11.309 --> 14:13.812
what you watched on TV until
you passed out. You hear me?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.897
Oh, the truth, huh?

14:15.939 --> 14:17.482
City needs a fall guy.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.359
-Hey, I need to hear you say...
-I'm fucked.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.319
-...you hear me.
-I am so fucked,

14:21.361 --> 14:24.197
because I fit.
I'm it.

14:24.239 --> 14:25.699
Say it.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.159
No alibi. Bosch.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.371
Frankie... I got your back.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.416
But I need to hear
you say the words.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.257
I hear you.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.633
I remember this one.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.885
That was a use of force
involving Rooker.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.013
Judge threw it out, but, uh,

14:48.054 --> 14:50.682
Sheehan got beefed
for a dust-up during the depo.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.434
Beefed by Elias?

14:52.475 --> 14:54.853
I think so.
It wasn't my case.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.397
That depo's probably
in archives.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.441
Let's get ahold of it.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.527
Any word from Sheehan?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.529
No. Fix and Pipes
are on their way in.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.323
You should start with

15:06.364 --> 15:08.742
-the cameras from the control
booth. -Would if I could.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.119
Central said we'll have it
later today.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.579
-Oh, stay on them.
-Pretty low res.

15:12.621 --> 15:14.080
I-I'm not hopeful.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.082
Where are we
on Elias' financials?

15:16.124 --> 15:18.293
On-call DA's
reviewing the warrant.

15:18.335 --> 15:21.671
Listen, I don't have time
for him to add his two cents.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.590
Well, he's not gonna
call a judge until he reads it.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.592
So take it to one of mine
directly.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.344
Wexler.
I'll make the call.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.638
-Judge Wexler.
-Yes.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.480
Drake came by earlier.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.357
- -What?

15:40.398 --> 15:43.151
I found him in here.
Poking around.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.195
What do you think that's about?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.407
Y-You leave the door open
or something?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.576
I just went to get coffee.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.622
All right.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.587
So, who is he?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.089
We don't know.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.091
Everyone was deferential to him.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.467
Fearful.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.636
A good beat-down
always sets the tone.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.346
I don't much like the risk
you took getting this.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.556
I thought it could
yield something.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.141
Look, I should probably mention

16:15.183 --> 16:18.186
on my way home,
I may have been tailed, so...

16:20.772 --> 16:22.941
Oh, it was you.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.526
He swore you wouldn't make him.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.403
Were you that worried about me?

16:26.444 --> 16:28.446
It's been a pleasure
working with you, Eleanor.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.285
He's firing me
because I took a photo?

16:34.327 --> 16:36.955
No, no. You've done
a great job for us.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.082
Don't handle me, Chuck.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.000
Wait.
Ask yourself--

16:41.042 --> 16:43.002
what's an anti-terrorism
task force doing tracking money

16:43.044 --> 16:45.672
from China through casinos
here and in Vegas?

16:45.714 --> 16:48.717
Yes, they're dumping it.
Yes, it's getting washed.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.344
But it's not going back.
It's all parked.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.221
Sitting there,
California banks.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.889
What are they using it for?

16:54.931 --> 16:57.934
Can't tell you more than that.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.395
-Okay, so let me go back
to the casinos. -Mm-mmm.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.188
This Chinese national's
connected to the game,

17:02.230 --> 17:04.441
-maybe I can find out.
-Look...

17:04.482 --> 17:06.443
you need to take some time off.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.319
-Jay...
-I submitted your paperwork

17:08.361 --> 17:10.029
for reinstatement.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.365
Now, D.C.'s gonna
take their own sweet time,

17:12.407 --> 17:14.159
but you can be optimistic,

17:14.200 --> 17:15.785
so get some rest.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.579
Spend some time
with your daughter.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.081
-You've earned it.
-Thanks.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.875
I can help you find this guy.

17:21.916 --> 17:24.377
I can't guarantee
where you're gonna be assigned.

17:24.419 --> 17:27.422
Let me know when
your credentials come through.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.369
I mean, if I gave a shit about
what people are saying

17:58.411 --> 18:00.413
about RHD, I'd have a lawyer
with me right now.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.749
But I was nowhere near
Howard Elias on Friday night,

18:02.791 --> 18:06.503
-and you know it. -Why don't you
run it down for me anyway?

18:06.544 --> 18:08.505
Me and Pipes were at RHD.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.340
Captain Garwood can confirm it.

18:10.381 --> 18:13.051
-Or I can pull the security log.
-Come on, Pierce.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.470
Check me off, let me go.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.306
You need to swipe your card
to use the elevator?

18:18.348 --> 18:20.391
Yeah.
Parking garage, elevators.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.852
Unless, you know,
I took the fucking stairs,

18:22.894 --> 18:24.395
'cause I was up to no good.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.484
You don't strike me as a "take
the fucking stairs" kind of guy.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.194
Working late,

18:31.236 --> 18:32.862
trial prep.
DA wanted fresh rap sheets

18:32.904 --> 18:35.240
-on all the wits. -You used
the databases, no doubt.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.950
Name and number.
Exact date and time

18:36.991 --> 18:39.285
-of when we ran those queries.
-Let's discuss when

18:39.327 --> 18:41.663
you all went to the junkyard
for Michael Harris.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.499
You looking for who killed Elias

18:44.541 --> 18:46.417
or you re-investigating
Black Guardian?

18:46.459 --> 18:49.587
It's all of a piece, isn't it?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.965
Report I read says only Sheehan
and Drake questioned Harris.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.050
Me and Fix
had to roll on a help call.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.593
Frank and Terry
had the lead on Harris.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.887
He did that nasty shit
to himself.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.098
Yeah, everybody keeps saying.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.225
But if you and Fix
had to peel off,

19:02.267 --> 19:04.561
how would you know
what the fuck he did?

19:07.438 --> 19:09.983
It's too bad things didn't
work out for you with us, Jimmy.

19:10.024 --> 19:13.027
Well... politics.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.613
One guy badmouths you,
all it takes.

19:16.865 --> 19:19.117
From what I hear...

19:19.158 --> 19:21.244
RHD--

19:21.286 --> 19:23.830
a few too many malcontents,

19:23.872 --> 19:26.332
guys about to retire.

19:26.374 --> 19:29.043
Maybe I dodged a bullet.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.761
Somebody pimped that ride.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.097
Talk to the neighbors.
He's got a pending possession.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.599
Comings and goings?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.642
Especially earlier today.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.575
What?

20:00.617 --> 20:02.327
What happened?

20:02.368 --> 20:04.078
I was elbowed playing ball.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.747
Same with your ride?

20:05.788 --> 20:07.248
What the fuck do you want?

20:07.290 --> 20:08.958
I got to clear you
for Friday night,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.960
and I'd like to get
a better sense of your father,

20:11.002 --> 20:12.211
if you have a minute.

20:12.253 --> 20:15.673
-Who he was, who he crossed.
-

20:20.345 --> 20:22.680
So, what is this

20:22.722 --> 20:24.933
Did you go out, stay in?

20:24.974 --> 20:28.186
Saudade.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.729
-Brazilian joint?
-Yeah.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.606
Walked in through
the kitchen.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.566
Uh, got to meet the chef
and shit.

20:33.608 --> 20:34.609
Did you go alone?

20:34.651 --> 20:37.070
Nah, I went with Bianca.

20:37.111 --> 20:40.281
-Bianca have a last name?
-Foley. Bianca Foley.

20:40.323 --> 20:41.991
I'll need a number.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.660
They got a nice little patio
out back.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.453
-I thought she'd dig it.
-Reservation?

20:45.495 --> 20:46.704
They don't take them.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.040
-Pay with a card?
-Cash.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.459
How long were you there?

20:51.501 --> 20:54.003
00,
left around midnight.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.172
You know,
in your father's office,

20:56.214 --> 20:58.758
there's a lot of photos of him
with other people.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.177
There's not one picture
of his son.

21:02.887 --> 21:05.264
Yeah, that about says it.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.600
Expectations?

21:07.642 --> 21:10.311
Harassment because
of who your father was?

21:10.353 --> 21:11.813
I'm a black man
in America, okay?

21:11.854 --> 21:13.356
Harassment's a given.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.942
Extra credit for being
the great man's son.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.278
Are we done?

21:20.780 --> 21:23.116
Ever meet his jury consultant?

21:24.534 --> 21:26.077
You want me to talk shit
about her?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.745
I don't care about
the e-mails or the texts.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.789
-How long have you...
-Fuck this, I want my lawyer.

21:29.831 --> 21:32.333
Oh. We got her side.
I'd like to hear yours.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.127
No. Lawyer.

21:34.168 --> 21:36.587
Unless you want to hook up
the son of Elias right now,

21:36.629 --> 21:38.756
this conversation's done.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.060
-Hey.
-Hey yourself.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.229
Jack, Joe, let's go.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.398
I don't want to have
to repeat myself-- come on.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.109
-No gizmos.
-Oh, man.

22:00.028 --> 22:02.280
We're gonna talk to each other,
old school.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.120
You going like that?

22:09.162 --> 22:12.415
Yoga. Coffee with Christina.
My usual Sunday.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.709
Y-You thought I was going with?

22:14.751 --> 22:16.044
Thought it might be nice.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.921
You know, family thing.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.007
Cop barbecue?

22:22.884 --> 22:23.968
It's your day with the boys, J.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.511
I'm not gonna mess with that.

22:28.222 --> 22:29.557
Have a good time.

22:29.599 --> 22:31.642
-We will.
-Okay.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.270
-Catch you later.
-Yeah.

22:44.447 --> 22:45.865
Morning, Bosch.

22:45.907 --> 22:48.576
Tell me
the city attorney called.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.078
Said she can meet
at her office

22:50.119 --> 22:51.412
00.

22:51.454 --> 22:53.372
Should I send one
of the IA ladies?

22:53.414 --> 22:55.166
No, no, no, send Pierce.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.585
I'm on my way to confirm
Martin Elias' alibi.

22:57.627 --> 23:00.254
Well, we can cross
Fix and Pipes off our list.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.590
Okay. Drake?

23:02.632 --> 23:04.509
Not quite yet.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.094
And still no sign of Sheehan.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.096
Mrs. Elias thinks Drake
and her husband

23:08.137 --> 23:09.597
had some bad blood.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.641
Cop of a different era.

23:11.682 --> 23:15.478
Yeah, okay. Just make him appear
for his interview, yeah?

23:15.520 --> 23:18.397
See what I can do... boss.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.486
Good job.

23:23.528 --> 23:27.031
Oh. So good.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.409
Good job.
Now turn. Turn.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.912
Oh, that's great.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.416
You're doing good. Turn.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.460
Good job.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.474
Okay, turn.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.776
Good.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.736
Wait. Know what you're signing.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.406
-The thing for the bank.
-No. That's the bottom one.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.700
-This is the college fund.
-Okay.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.286
Hey, you won't be so flip
about it next year

24:13.327 --> 24:14.745
when you need money for books.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.415
Why

24:17.456 --> 24:20.168
You're 18, Maddie.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.170
You need to start
handling your own finances,

24:22.211 --> 24:24.172
know where all
the important papers are.

24:24.213 --> 24:25.590
-I'm serious.
-So am I.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.175
It doesn't matter where
I'm gonna be.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.343
It's a simple question.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.972
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

24:33.014 --> 24:34.807
Don't worry.

24:34.849 --> 24:38.019
You're the one acting weird
about it.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.354
A year from now,
you're gonna be begging me

24:40.396 --> 24:42.148
to stay out of your life.

24:42.190 --> 24:44.317
Mom.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.736
Now the bank one.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.923
- -Uh-oh.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.719
Brother Howard was
a brother when it served

25:11.761 --> 25:13.888
-his purpose.
-That's harsh.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.473
Friend of mine--
remember Good Washington?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.099
I remember Bad Washington.

25:17.141 --> 25:20.102
-Oh, the morgue dude.
-See, that's my point.

25:20.144 --> 25:21.812
Elias blew up Good Washington's
whole goddamn career

25:21.854 --> 25:23.981
before he even had a chance
to get it started.

25:24.023 --> 25:28.569
Big settlement over a thing that
didn't happen. His usual play.

25:28.611 --> 25:33.658
-Only color that man cared about
was green. -Call me crazy.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.868
I have missed being around
all you knuckleheads.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.828
-You are crazy. -He's right.
I hear ten cents on dollar

25:37.870 --> 25:40.248
is all
you're gonna clear over...

25:40.289 --> 25:41.791
If I had a hundred bucks every
time somebody's said that...

25:41.832 --> 25:43.584
It'll still be a lot less
than a medical pension.

25:43.626 --> 25:46.170
Counting on your boy Bosch
to do the right thing

25:46.212 --> 25:47.630
with this task force, J.

25:47.672 --> 25:50.174
He's not my anything,

25:50.216 --> 25:53.761
but he goes
where the truth takes him.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.763
I am getting slammed
for this spin

25:55.805 --> 25:58.599
that Elias was murdered
during a robbery.

25:58.641 --> 26:00.226
You know, under the
circumstances, Hector,

26:00.268 --> 26:01.727
I don't... I don't see how

26:01.769 --> 26:03.312
the department can be
any more transparent.

26:03.354 --> 26:04.814
Better question is,
how does Scott Anderson know

26:04.855 --> 26:06.315
it wasn't a robbery?

26:06.357 --> 26:07.692
I was hoping
you could answer that question.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.527
It's your department.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.113
My people understand there's
a strict need-to-know policy

26:12.154 --> 26:14.490
in place with this case.
How about yours?

26:14.532 --> 26:17.326
Let's not waste energy
speculating about leaks.

26:17.368 --> 26:22.039
What I'm saying, Chief,
is that we-- or rather you,

26:22.081 --> 26:24.041
since this is all
your territory now--

26:24.083 --> 26:25.793
you've got to stay
in front of this.

26:25.835 --> 26:28.337
So you want me to control
what reporters write?

26:29.797 --> 26:31.424
Start small.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.551
Just get Anderson off my back.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.969
He's got me on speed dial.

26:35.011 --> 26:36.637
Well, honeymoon's over.

26:36.679 --> 26:39.932
Hector's feeling the heat
for the first time.

26:39.974 --> 26:42.059
Good you can trust your team
to prioritize.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.353
So much noise around this case.

26:44.395 --> 26:47.523
Well, I can assure you
it has their singular focus.

26:47.565 --> 26:48.983
Bosch mentioned some cold case

26:49.025 --> 26:51.610
he was working on
before all this broke.

26:51.652 --> 26:54.030
You know anything about that?

26:54.071 --> 26:57.992
Detectives have a lot of cases.

26:58.034 --> 27:00.745
Why was he talking
to you about it?

27:00.786 --> 27:03.664
No idea.

27:03.706 --> 27:07.418
Is there something about Harry
Bosch that concerns you, Brad?

27:09.545 --> 27:11.172
Not at all.

27:11.213 --> 27:13.174
Not at all.
I trust your judgment.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.384
Like yourself, I just want
to make sure Howard Elias

27:15.426 --> 27:17.261
has our full attention.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.811
Justice for Elias!

27:25.853 --> 27:28.647
Justice for Elias!
Justice for L.A.!

27:28.689 --> 27:31.609
Justice for Elias! Justice
for L.A.!

27:31.650 --> 27:35.237
Justice for Elias! Justice
for L.A.! Justice for Elias!

27:35.279 --> 27:37.406
Dad.

27:37.448 --> 27:40.242
You going back to work mean you
won't be coming over as much?

27:40.284 --> 27:41.744
I don't see why.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.746
Mom says you're gonna get busy.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.456
I can be busy
and still come over.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.083
During the week?

27:47.124 --> 27:48.501
Yeah, maybe.

27:48.542 --> 27:51.170
Mom's "maybe" always means "no."

27:51.212 --> 27:52.797
Dad's not Mom.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.840
Just saying.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.222
This witness list
is about the only discovery

28:01.263 --> 28:03.391
city attorney had that we don't.

28:03.432 --> 28:04.892
Yeah, Sheehan's on here.

28:04.934 --> 28:06.394
Drake, Rooker.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.896
Huh, with the rest of RHD
and half the city.

28:08.938 --> 28:10.398
What if it isn't a cop?

28:10.439 --> 28:12.149
What if pigs could fly?

28:12.191 --> 28:15.152
Well, the way it went down,
the text, the meet up,

28:15.194 --> 28:17.238
Black Guardian trial
about to start.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.073
Someone Elias knew.

28:19.115 --> 28:21.492
Someone who knows how to do it.

28:21.534 --> 28:23.327
Somebody with everything to lose
at the trial.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.204
If not a cop, cop-like.

28:25.246 --> 28:29.417
Could Elias have flipped
a witness who saw or knows

28:29.458 --> 28:30.876
what happened with Harris?

28:32.128 --> 28:33.712
Drake?

28:33.754 --> 28:35.923
Still need to get his story.

28:35.965 --> 28:38.259
Could explain
why Sheehan's avoiding us.

28:38.300 --> 28:41.011
Special Master could cut
through all the fog.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.013
See if you can
ping Sheehan's phone,

28:43.055 --> 28:45.057
get a location on him.

28:49.103 --> 28:51.480
More cam stuff from Central.

28:51.522 --> 28:53.023
You were right
about that restaurant.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.109
Closed two weeks ago.

28:55.151 --> 28:56.819
Kid lied.

28:56.861 --> 28:59.321
Yeah. And just walked into
the station with his lawyer.

28:59.363 --> 29:01.323
Says it's to "clear things up."

29:01.365 --> 29:03.367
Shit.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.330
Bosch.

29:08.372 --> 29:11.584
Next time you haul in a suspect
with as much potential blowback

29:11.625 --> 29:13.502
as Martin Elias,
I would appreciate a heads-up.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.546
Hauled himself in.
I think a little blowback

29:15.588 --> 29:17.923
-might be part of the plan here.
-Fuck.

29:17.965 --> 29:19.925
Is he good
for his father's murder?

29:19.967 --> 29:22.052
I hope not.
That'd be a real circus.

29:22.094 --> 29:25.389
Well, if he's not,
get him the hell out.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.558
Just tell the truth, okay?

29:27.600 --> 29:30.102
Detective Bosch, Alex Kaplan.

29:30.144 --> 29:32.146
Please, sit.

29:34.190 --> 29:37.651
Now, my client wishes to clarify
his earlier statement

29:37.693 --> 29:40.738
about where he was Friday night.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.616
Saudade's been shuttered
for over two weeks.

29:43.657 --> 29:45.826
But, funny thing.

29:46.869 --> 29:48.746
We called Ms. Foley,

29:48.787 --> 29:50.664
and she backed your play.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.333
So, false statement,

29:52.374 --> 29:54.752
obstruction, now you got her
in the shit, too.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.755
Yeah, she was with me.

29:57.796 --> 29:58.881
But not at dinner.

29:58.923 --> 30:00.674
-We were at SC.
-Doing what?

30:00.716 --> 30:03.135
Slinging dope to the guys who
did the job on you and your car?

30:03.177 --> 30:05.387
Detective Bosch, Martin has
voluntarily come here

30:05.429 --> 30:07.014
to help you find
his father's murderer.

30:07.056 --> 30:08.682
Let's stay on point, please.

30:08.724 --> 30:11.101
It's not real drugs.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.103
I-I grind up Adrafinil
and sell it as Addy.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.480
They can't tell the difference.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.735
Uh, it's a sorority on 28th,
off Fig.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.779
"Sig" something.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.490
Uh, it's mid-terms,
the sisters want a boost.

30:24.532 --> 30:26.700
So we stayed, we partied
a little and I went home.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.828
A written statement of what
my client just told you, and...

30:32.206 --> 30:35.668
...time-stamped video of some
of the evening's festivities.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.294
He was there past midnight.

30:40.673 --> 30:42.466
Then why lie?

30:42.508 --> 30:44.885
Like selling fake speed
to rich white girls

30:44.927 --> 30:46.887
would do my possession case
any good.

30:48.389 --> 30:49.765
Detective, Martin understands

30:49.807 --> 30:51.600
he has just admitted
to a misdemeanor.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.394
But in light
of his personal tragedy,

30:53.435 --> 30:54.979
-and the mood of the city...
-You waltz in here

30:55.020 --> 30:56.438
with your face looking like that

30:56.480 --> 30:58.649
so the press will see it
and think cops did it.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.609
Now you want a solid from me?

31:00.651 --> 31:04.071
Coming here was my mom's idea.

31:05.781 --> 31:07.575
We'll need
to confirm everything.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.952
-However we can help. -And that
ass-whipping isn't behind

31:09.994 --> 31:11.954
selling some
bullshit Adderall, is it?

31:13.998 --> 31:16.208
No. Uh...

31:16.250 --> 31:18.836
Me and Bianca,
we've been hanging.

31:18.877 --> 31:22.715
And, uh, her-her boy
found out, so...

31:27.761 --> 31:30.556
Last thing my dad tells me
was that I need to man up,

31:30.598 --> 31:32.182
and take responsibility.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.727
When you gonna start?

31:34.768 --> 31:36.687
Cheating on my mom...

31:38.772 --> 31:44.111
...a woman who-who stood by him,
and-and made him a home,

31:44.153 --> 31:45.738
and he preaches to me

31:45.779 --> 31:48.699
that I'm the one
that needs to man up?

31:48.741 --> 31:49.950
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

31:53.495 --> 31:54.872
Right there, right there!

31:54.913 --> 31:56.749
Martin! Martin!

32:01.462 --> 32:03.672
No peace! No justice,

32:03.714 --> 32:06.133
no peace! No justice, no peace!

32:06.175 --> 32:08.135
No justice, no peace!

32:08.177 --> 32:09.803
No justice, no peace...

32:15.267 --> 32:17.269
How about a little smile?

32:21.565 --> 32:23.776
Is there gonna be
much more of this?

32:23.817 --> 32:25.819
We're good.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.909
Thank you for making time
on a Sunday.

32:33.911 --> 32:36.789
What made you change your mind
about letting me do the profile?

32:38.832 --> 32:40.417
Well, you've always been
fairly straight,

32:40.459 --> 32:42.044
covering crime in this city.

32:42.086 --> 32:45.422
Don't expect a puff piece.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.634
Is this where you preach to me
about fairness and accuracy?

32:48.676 --> 32:50.844
Guess not.

32:50.886 --> 32:53.472
Because your newspaper's
coverage of Black Guardian

32:53.514 --> 32:55.683
and the Elias case
has been decidedly one-sided.

32:55.724 --> 32:59.687
Scott Anderson's leading
the charge on that, not me.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.898
You should want it to be right,
whether you write it or not.

33:02.940 --> 33:04.983
A question of access, Chief.

33:05.025 --> 33:08.737
A reporter gets access,
a reporter gets it right.

33:08.779 --> 33:12.116
Whether it's an on-the-record
relationship or not.

33:13.951 --> 33:16.036
Well, if I was to have
the, uh...

33:16.078 --> 33:20.666
...go-to person,
confidentially or not,

33:20.708 --> 33:24.044
it would have to be someone
I could trust unconditionally.

33:24.086 --> 33:26.964
Trust works both ways.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.927
And what's that
look like to you?

33:33.178 --> 33:35.848
Your cell phone number,
for a start.

33:35.889 --> 33:39.518
So that when I need
to get to you, I can.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.981
Well, let's see
how this profile turns out.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.734
Then we'll talk
about going forward.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.576
Glad you could finally make it.

33:58.871 --> 34:00.831
Red pork tamales.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.875
I just ate.

34:31.695 --> 34:33.697
-Is that...?
-Yeah.

34:35.783 --> 34:36.992
Gun...

34:37.034 --> 34:40.621
with just a bit of hand
gripping it.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.377
Is that hand black or white?

34:54.301 --> 34:55.469
You know the drill.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.679
-Checkable facts.
-Mm-hmm.

34:57.721 --> 35:01.183
Good. Make the witness
feel comfortable.

35:01.225 --> 35:04.269
But sometimes you used to press,
make 'em anxious.

35:04.311 --> 35:06.855
-You feeling anxious, Terry?
-Not in the least.

35:06.897 --> 35:08.899
Then indulge me.

35:08.941 --> 35:11.193
Just still in a hurry.

35:13.654 --> 35:16.907
Okay... Friday night.

35:16.949 --> 35:19.451
I took my grandson
to a Clippers game,

35:19.493 --> 35:22.204
dropped him off after,
talked with my son.

35:22.246 --> 35:23.664
Then I got the news about Elias.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.499
-From Sheehan?
-Rooker.

35:25.541 --> 35:27.417
He and Pipes and Fix
were at RHD,

35:27.459 --> 35:29.753
and I tagged along for the call.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.463
You still tight with them?

35:33.090 --> 35:34.174
Some of 'em.

35:34.216 --> 35:35.926
And where was Sheehan?

35:35.968 --> 35:37.970
-Ask him.
-I would love to.

35:38.011 --> 35:40.264
He should have been here by now.

35:40.305 --> 35:43.475
Maybe he got caught up
in some police work. Uh...

35:43.517 --> 35:45.435
He'll make his way down here.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.145
Any idea why he's being shy?

35:47.187 --> 35:49.398
We were only partners
for a short time.

35:49.439 --> 35:53.861
Still, you got to know him,
like you do.

35:53.902 --> 35:56.113
Are we still talking
about Elias?

35:56.154 --> 35:58.240
You never liked him, did you?

35:58.282 --> 35:59.825
Even back in the day.

35:59.867 --> 36:03.120
No, I did not.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.163
The man's got a binary view
of the world--

36:05.205 --> 36:07.040
no... no room for nuance.

36:07.082 --> 36:10.043
Like with Michael Harris.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.882
I mean, we were tough on Harris,

36:14.923 --> 36:16.466
but we didn't cross the line.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.634
Harris...

36:17.676 --> 36:19.636
Yeah, palmed that pencil and...

36:19.678 --> 36:21.471
...punctured his own ear.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.223
And screamed torture.

36:23.265 --> 36:24.474
Then we find out later he'd done

36:24.516 --> 36:26.351
a similar thing before.
Look it up.

36:26.393 --> 36:31.023
Tried to jack this insurance
company on a fraudulent claim.

36:33.442 --> 36:35.861
Santi, you know me.

36:35.903 --> 36:37.779
We got history.

36:37.821 --> 36:40.365
You know that I'm not
capable of that.

36:40.407 --> 36:41.742
Or this.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.412
You're right.

36:45.454 --> 36:48.707
I do know you.... well.

36:49.750 --> 36:52.628
My word ain't enough?

36:52.669 --> 36:56.506
It was... once.

37:01.386 --> 37:04.514
Chief.
This about Martin Elias?

37:04.556 --> 37:06.975
No,
Lieutenant Billets filled me in.

37:07.017 --> 37:09.519
Optics work both ways.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.314
We get this wrong,
the city could explode.

37:12.356 --> 37:14.441
You mean if we get it right.

37:14.483 --> 37:16.652
Where are you
on your mother's case?

37:18.403 --> 37:19.780
Still grinding. Why?

37:19.821 --> 37:22.157
Spoke with Bradley Walker
this morning.

37:22.199 --> 37:24.701
You've been trying
to get in his head.

37:24.743 --> 37:27.120
On my time, not yours.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.205
Guess it worked.

37:28.246 --> 37:31.041
All your time is my time now.

37:31.083 --> 37:33.168
Give Walker a wide berth.

37:33.210 --> 37:35.253
So I don't have
to brief him on Elias?

37:35.295 --> 37:38.757
On Elias, Bosch. Only Elias.

37:42.094 --> 37:43.845
If you need more bodies
for your task force...

37:43.887 --> 37:44.846
The more people,
the more chance

37:44.888 --> 37:46.473
they go off the reservation.

37:46.515 --> 37:49.267
Unless it's another
real detective, no thanks.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.283
Thank you.

38:07.577 --> 38:11.248
City attorney's discovery
was thin, but you knew that.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.875
Why is it that guys like you,
when you don't get your own way,

38:13.917 --> 38:15.460
always assume it's personal?

38:15.502 --> 38:17.713
Tell me about
this witness list.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.256
Lengthy.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.924
Meant to daze and confuse.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.968
In a trial that Elias
apparently thought

38:23.010 --> 38:24.219
wouldn't last long.

38:24.261 --> 38:26.805
Read into that
whatever you like.

38:26.847 --> 38:29.725
Someone turned this case
for him.

38:29.766 --> 38:31.476
I can't share
his strategy, Bosch.

38:31.518 --> 38:33.020
I can guess his strategy.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.063
Terry Drake and Frankie Sheehan
are the only ones

38:35.105 --> 38:37.691
who know for sure what happened
in that junkyard bathroom.

38:37.733 --> 38:40.610
Is that a question
or an answer?

38:40.652 --> 38:42.279
You tell me.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.073
Nice try.

38:45.115 --> 38:48.702
Again, we're stuck at
what I can't legally divulge.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.704
Not a good place to be.

38:50.746 --> 38:53.707
So, if you will excuse me...

39:41.963 --> 39:43.507
Hey.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.592
-You got a moment?
-Sure. Come in.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.683
There's a D-Three spot
in Newton Division.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.644
I was hoping you could
reach out for me.

39:55.685 --> 39:58.647
-Homicide?
-Mm-hmm.

39:58.688 --> 40:02.818
Well, they're probably gonna
upgrade from within.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.277
I know it's a long shot.
Still, I want to put in

40:04.319 --> 40:05.445
my paperwork
and see what happens.

40:07.614 --> 40:09.616
Is this about Bosch?

40:09.658 --> 40:11.284
I need to promote, L-T.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.370
Jimmy, right here in Hollywood

40:13.411 --> 40:14.996
we've got two D-Threes

40:15.038 --> 40:16.915
who are in their
final year of DROP.

40:16.957 --> 40:19.459
And I know that it
cannot be easy

40:19.501 --> 40:21.336
for somebody with your
experience to work under him,

40:21.378 --> 40:23.672
but Bosch is not gonna
be here forever.

40:23.713 --> 40:25.757
You'll make the call?

40:25.799 --> 40:28.760
I was looking at you
to take over the unit.

40:34.015 --> 40:35.600
I'll make the call.

40:35.642 --> 40:38.728
They'd be lucky to have you.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.523
Thanks.

40:41.565 --> 40:43.859
And let's face it, L-T,

40:43.900 --> 40:46.695
Bosch... will be here forever.

40:54.619 --> 40:57.664
I go in the bathroom,
feel his toothbrush--

40:57.706 --> 41:01.209
-dry as a bone.
- My man.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.170
If you're gonna lie,
you've got to sell it.

41:03.211 --> 41:06.256
I said, "Joe, you told me
you brushed your teeth."

41:06.298 --> 41:08.508
Little man looks me
right in the eye,

41:08.550 --> 41:10.886
innocent Edgar look, and says,

41:10.927 --> 41:13.471
"Oh, I thought you meant
last night."

41:13.513 --> 41:16.099
- -Shh.

41:28.445 --> 41:29.946
Lieutenant.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.406
What's up?

41:31.448 --> 41:34.159
Chief Irving wants you
on the Elias task force.

41:34.201 --> 41:35.410
Are you up to it?

41:35.452 --> 41:37.996
You know me,
suit up and show up.

41:39.039 --> 41:41.041
Okay. I appreciate it.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.792
See you tomorrow.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.502
Yeah.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.300
Billets.

41:52.052 --> 41:54.721
Checking to see if I'm ready
to go in.

41:54.763 --> 41:57.474
You know.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.310
I'm ready, you know?

42:00.352 --> 42:01.978
...if you couldn't eat it,

42:02.020 --> 42:04.648
what makes you think
one of us would want to?

42:04.689 --> 42:06.733
It's official, he's weird.

42:06.775 --> 42:08.735
-I just don't like kale.
-

42:08.777 --> 42:12.197
-I have to take this.
-What?

42:15.659 --> 42:17.452
I cannot believe it's you.

42:17.494 --> 42:19.746
Sorry I've been out of touch.

42:19.788 --> 42:21.790
You were supposed
to be here already.

42:21.831 --> 42:23.541
I know.
I can't talk long, Maddie,

42:23.583 --> 42:24.793
I'm using a friend's computer.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.086
Where's yours?

42:26.127 --> 42:28.088
That's a long story.

42:28.129 --> 42:30.090
We've been kind of worried.

42:30.131 --> 42:31.675
Yes, well, it's complicated.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.218
My passport was revoked.

42:33.260 --> 42:34.970
-I'm not allowed to travel.
-What?

42:35.011 --> 42:36.179
Why

42:36.221 --> 42:37.180
Well, I got her voice mail.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.015
I don't know.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.767
She's so lame about her phone.

42:40.809 --> 42:42.352
I'll try to call her again.

42:42.394 --> 42:44.437
I just wanted you both to know
that I'm safe

42:44.479 --> 42:46.731
-and working to resolve this.
-Safe?

42:46.773 --> 42:48.650
What is going on?

42:48.692 --> 42:50.360
-Reggie?
-That's all I can say.

42:50.402 --> 42:51.903
Ask your mother.

42:51.945 --> 42:53.321
Reggie.

42:53.363 --> 42:55.323
And take care.

42:55.365 --> 42:57.367
I love you. Talk soon.

43:04.207 --> 43:06.668
-Mom...
-Hey. How'd it go?

43:06.710 --> 43:08.712
I just talked to Reggie.
He's still in China.

43:08.753 --> 43:09.796
He tried to call you.

43:09.838 --> 43:11.631
What What did he say?

43:11.673 --> 43:13.300
They took away his passport,

43:13.341 --> 43:14.467
so he can't get out
of the country.

43:14.509 --> 43:15.593
Wait. What?

43:15.635 --> 43:16.720
What is going on?

43:16.761 --> 43:17.804
And please don't say "nothing."

43:17.846 --> 43:19.014
Honey, I don't know.

43:19.055 --> 43:21.850
-What did you do?
-Nothing.

43:21.891 --> 43:23.643
I am so sick of this.

43:23.685 --> 43:25.520
Okay, I haven't talked
with him yet.

43:25.562 --> 43:26.938
We've been working
through some things,

43:26.980 --> 43:28.898
-so, I mean, it's...
-Complicated?

43:28.940 --> 43:31.484
Is that your way of saying
you're splitting up?

43:31.526 --> 43:33.403
No.

43:33.445 --> 43:34.738
So you don't want
to tell me. Fine.

43:34.779 --> 43:37.615
There's nothing to tell.

43:37.657 --> 43:40.660
Go ahead and screw up
your relationship with Reggie,

43:40.702 --> 43:42.120
just don't mess up mine.

43:42.162 --> 43:43.455
Madeline...

44:14.152 --> 44:16.738
I knocked.

44:16.780 --> 44:19.199
Nobody was home.

44:29.250 --> 44:31.378
If someone was, I'd be
throwing your fuckin' ass

44:31.419 --> 44:33.338
down that hill.

44:33.380 --> 44:36.091
You think I killed Elias?

44:36.132 --> 44:37.842
Where you been, Frank?

44:37.884 --> 44:39.552
Here and there.

44:39.594 --> 44:42.722
Doesn't matter.

44:42.764 --> 44:46.309
Everyone's a suspect
till they're not.

44:48.812 --> 44:50.355
I have all these...

44:50.397 --> 44:55.527
thoughts rattling around
in my head.

44:55.568 --> 44:58.822
I'll bet you do.

44:58.863 --> 45:02.742
Quickest way to clear
yourself, Frank...

45:02.784 --> 45:04.035
give me your piece.

45:16.423 --> 45:18.466
Sorry, Harry.

45:18.508 --> 45:23.430
Nowhere else to go.

45:23.471 --> 45:26.224
Come on.

45:26.266 --> 45:27.934
Let's go inside.

45:29.561 --> 45:33.314
Oh, shit, it's fucking
cold up here at night.

45:33.356 --> 45:35.733
Yeah. Catalina eddy.

45:35.775 --> 45:38.653
Wind comes whipping
off the ocean.

45:53.918 --> 45:55.712
Go inside.
