13:22.677 --> 13:25.472
Yeah. Gawrsh, I guess I did.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.807
Hyuck, hyuck.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.559
Consumer rip-off!

13:29.642 --> 13:33.271
Pete stole my dad's vacation!

13:36.024 --> 13:39.778
Well, enjoy your vacation in Hawaii, sir.

13:39.861 --> 13:43.615
-Just don't break the island, OK?
-[crowd laughing]

13:44.157 --> 13:46.826
No, really,
I'd love to go there myself someday,

13:46.910 --> 13:49.996
if it's still there. Ha ha ha ha!

13:50.080 --> 13:52.874
Of all the two-faced, no-good...

13:52.957 --> 13:54.626
Low-down, doody-daddy...

13:54.709 --> 13:56.378
Pot-bellied, melon-headed...

13:56.461 --> 13:58.963
You... you... you... Hawaii stealer!

13:59.047 --> 14:01.132
Vacation stealing clods!

14:01.216 --> 14:02.467
You forgot slimy.

14:02.550 --> 14:06.346
You mean we don't get to go to Hawaii?

14:06.471 --> 14:08.306
Aw, Dad.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.891
Now don't give up yet.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.268
You just wait until lardo gets home.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.354
[chuckles] I'll use my secret weapon.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.689
What's that?

14:15.772 --> 14:17.023
My mouth!

14:20.902 --> 14:24.739
OK, Houston, we have ETA
in approximately...

14:24.823 --> 14:27.701
Four... three... two... one...

14:27.784 --> 14:31.371
[Peg] You miserable,
cheese-eating pile of flab!

14:31.454 --> 14:35.125
Your own neighbour's never
had a decent vacation in his life!

14:35.208 --> 14:38.586
His kid tries to give him one,
and you go and steal it from him!

14:38.670 --> 14:41.673
Of all the low-down, miserable, no-good...

14:41.756 --> 14:45.427
But, dumplin' dip,
I did it for you and the kids.

14:45.510 --> 14:49.556
I wouldn't luau with you
if my hula hips depended on it!

14:50.140 --> 14:52.267
You give those tickets
back to Goofy and Max,

14:52.350 --> 14:54.602
or you're going on vacation alone!

14:55.437 --> 14:59.691
Hmpff! Well, maybe I just will go alone.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.317
[grumbling]

15:01.401 --> 15:04.195
Busted my buns.
Trashed my own property.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.197
Crashed into cactus.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.366
I earned it fair and square, see?

15:08.450 --> 15:09.743
I can't believe--

15:09.826 --> 15:12.328
I'll go to Hawaii all by myself

15:12.412 --> 15:13.913
if I have to.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.290
[doorbell rings]

15:16.833 --> 15:18.960
Mom, you were really awesome!

15:19.044 --> 15:20.587
That was very well done.

15:20.670 --> 15:21.880
Thanks, Pistol.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.214
I'm sorry, guys.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.759
I gave it my best shot. No luck.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.511
Hey, does corned beef depend on luck?

15:28.595 --> 15:29.846
Gather around, everybody.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.724
This con game just went into overtime.

15:32.807 --> 15:35.560
If there's one thing
I learned from Pete,

15:35.643 --> 15:36.895
it's that we gotta...

15:36.978 --> 15:38.730
-think big.
-Think big.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.274
So here's what we're gonna do.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.040
Sleepin' like a baby.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.458
OK, Let's get to work.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.799
And... action!

16:07.300 --> 16:10.345
[Goofy] Peeete!

16:10.428 --> 16:14.849
Ohh, Peeete!

16:25.485 --> 16:28.822
Howdy, Peeete.

16:35.537 --> 16:40.000
Yup. Drowned in my own fishin' bucket.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.627
Some say I done myself in,

16:42.711 --> 16:44.129
that I couldn't face

16:44.212 --> 16:47.173
another vacation in the backyard

16:47.257 --> 16:50.885
while my neighbour flew off to Hawaii

16:50.969 --> 16:53.430
with my ticket.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.599
Uh, uh, n-- n-- now look, pally,

16:56.683 --> 16:58.768
i-- it isn't like that at all.

16:58.852 --> 17:03.023
Ohhh, you did it, Pete!

17:03.106 --> 17:05.025
Guilty!

17:05.108 --> 17:07.485
Guilty!

17:07.569 --> 17:10.363
Stand by for scene two.

17:15.118 --> 17:17.495
[babbling]

17:17.579 --> 17:20.457
Well, I meant to,
but I didn't really mean to.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.835
Oh, but I was only the first victim

17:23.918 --> 17:26.671
of your villainy, Pete.

17:26.755 --> 17:31.718
Travel now behind
the raveled curtain of time

17:31.801 --> 17:35.347
and into the future!

The biggest used car dealer in the world.

17:50.111 --> 17:53.281
Junk heaps as far as the eye can see,

17:53.365 --> 17:55.450

17:55.533 --> 17:58.203
That is, until I unload 'em

17:58.286 --> 18:01.456

Ha ha ha ha!

Uh, uh, Mr. Max, uh, sir?

18:08.296 --> 18:09.923
Buttercup?

18:10.006 --> 18:14.219
You aren't here to beg
for another raise, are you?

18:14.302 --> 18:16.471
Because you won't get one, see?

18:16.596 --> 18:19.015
Oh, but you pay so little,

18:19.099 --> 18:21.101
I can't even buy food.

18:21.184 --> 18:22.394
Should've thought of that

18:22.477 --> 18:25.230
before you let me steal Pete's car lot.

18:25.313 --> 18:27.899
That kid took over my business?

18:27.982 --> 18:30.110
Oh, you tricked him!

18:30.193 --> 18:32.737
You pretended to be Pete's friend,

18:32.821 --> 18:34.572
and then you stole it from him!

18:34.656 --> 18:37.117
[sobs] It was cruel.

from your late husband.

as your cleaning lady

18:49.504 --> 18:53.174
for only 3 cents an hour.

18:53.258 --> 18:57.178
What? Why, that's 2 cents
less than I pay my ma.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.764
I'll rip that weasel limb from limb.
