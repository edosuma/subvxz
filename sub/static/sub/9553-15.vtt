<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Johnson brings the ball

01:22.580 --> 01:24.670
(over P.A.):
They're moving the ball
around now.

01:24.670 --> 01:26.170
Moving it all around the court.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.420
Wait, there's a pass to Calvey.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.420
Calvey misses.

01:30.420 --> 01:31.840
Donley goes up for the score!

01:32.180 --> 01:33.210
(cheering)

01:33.630 --> 01:36.550
Two points by Donley on a missed
shot by Calvey of Jefferson.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.880
What's the matter
with you, Ralph?

01:38.380 --> 01:39.380
Sullivan brings the ball
into Paley.
Can't you take a hint?

01:39.880 --> 01:41.380
You asked Darlene
out five times.

01:41.380 --> 01:42.690
Every time,
she turned you down.

01:42.890 --> 01:44.970
Yeah, well, wait till she hears
my new comedy routine,

01:44.970 --> 01:47.470
she'll be dying
to go out with me.

01:47.470 --> 01:48.980
Humor always
gets them, Richie.

01:48.980 --> 01:49.980
(whistle blows)
You want to hear it?

01:50.480 --> 01:51.480
No.
Knock, knock.

01:51.980 --> 01:52.480
All right,
who's there?

01:52.980 --> 01:53.480
Cantaloupe.

01:53.900 --> 01:54.980
Cantaloupe who?

01:54.980 --> 01:56.480
Cantaloupe without a girl.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.490
(chuckles)

02:00.900 --> 02:01.990
He missed the foul shot.

02:01.990 --> 02:04.490
Uh... Lam-Lambert
grabs the rebound,

02:04.490 --> 02:06.490
dribbles around...
Adcock and scores.

02:06.490 --> 02:07.490
(cheering)

02:07.490 --> 02:09.000
(crowd groans)

02:09.000 --> 02:11.800
That was Lambert
who scored.

02:12.050 --> 02:13.470
Adcock!

02:13.720 --> 02:15.300
Did you ever hear
of the word "defense?!"

02:15.300 --> 02:17.090
Yeah, but I...
Get in there!

02:17.250 --> 02:18.840
(crowd shouting)

02:21.090 --> 02:22.680
(crowd groans)

02:29.180 --> 02:32.190
(cheering)

02:37.070 --> 02:39.160
(chanting):
Feed 'em wheat, feed 'em oats,

02:39.160 --> 02:41.160
feed 'em to the billy goats!

02:41.160 --> 02:42.660
(cheering)
Yeah!

02:42.660 --> 02:45.530
POTSIE: Marshall intercepts
and brings the ball down court.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.170
You pull your skirt down.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.000
Passes to Calvey.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.460
Calvey scores with
a pretty good set shot!

02:56.260 --> 02:57.840
Two points,
that's two points

02:57.840 --> 02:59.850
for Jefferson's
high scorer, Calvey.

02:59.850 --> 03:00.850
How many points is that
for Calvey, Al?

03:00.850 --> 03:02.350
Calvey...

03:02.350 --> 03:05.350
Two, four,

03:05.350 --> 03:07.300
six, seven...

03:07.720 --> 03:08.810
There's only
one minute left.

03:08.810 --> 03:11.310
I guess we're not gonna
see Richie tonight.

03:11.310 --> 03:12.310
That's all
right, dear.

03:12.310 --> 03:14.310
We'll see him
later at home.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.480
POTSIE:
Calvey steals the ball
with quick hands!

03:19.480 --> 03:20.480
20 seconds to go.

03:20.480 --> 03:21.990
(whistle blows)
No! He tripped!

03:21.990 --> 03:23.490
He trips!

03:23.490 --> 03:24.990
Calvey's tripped,
no foul is called.

03:24.990 --> 03:25.990
What a gyp.

03:25.990 --> 03:27.490
But an Oshkosh player
touched it last,

03:27.490 --> 03:28.490
so it's Jefferson's ball.

03:28.490 --> 03:29.960
Wait, wait.
He's getting up hurt.

03:30.330 --> 03:31.910
Official time-out.

03:31.910 --> 03:32.710
(buzzer sounds)

03:32.910 --> 03:34.000
POTSIE:
Talk about tension.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.470
If Jefferson wins this game,
the semifinals,

03:36.470 --> 03:38.470
they're just one game away
from playing in

03:38.470 --> 03:39.840
the state championships
at Madison.

03:40.090 --> 03:41.170
Cunningham!

03:41.170 --> 03:42.670
No, Coach,
I'm Malph.

03:42.670 --> 03:44.670
I know that.

03:44.670 --> 03:45.680
He knew my name!

03:46.180 --> 03:46.680
Sit down!

03:47.180 --> 03:48.180
I'm gonna sit
down, Coach.

03:48.180 --> 03:49.680
Cunningham, come here.
Yes.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.680
Cunningham, twisted ankle,
Calvert's out.

03:51.680 --> 03:52.980
Aw...
You're in.

03:53.180 --> 03:54.270
Ooh!

03:55.770 --> 03:58.270
I've been watching; got a lot
of confidence in you, kid.

03:58.270 --> 03:59.270
Looking at you out there
in practice,

03:59.270 --> 04:01.270
you know, doing a lot of
good things with the ball.

04:01.270 --> 04:02.280
Yeah, thanks, Coach.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.280
I've got some very important
strategy for you.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.280
Name it.

04:05.780 --> 04:07.780
Don't shoot.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.280
Don't do anything.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.280
But, Coach, we're
one point behind.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.790
I know. If you get the ball,
pass it to Donnally.

04:13.790 --> 04:15.290
Oh, better than that,
just hold it.

04:15.290 --> 04:17.620
Donnally will come by
and take it from you.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.510
Okay, get on out there.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.010
(crowd cheering)

04:21.010 --> 04:22.510
POTSIE:
Cunningham in for Calvey.

04:22.510 --> 04:24.510
Ten seconds to go, and Jefferson
is behind by one point.

04:24.510 --> 04:25.520
(whistle blows)

04:25.520 --> 04:27.520
(crowd shouting)

04:27.520 --> 04:28.970
Pass it!
Pass it!

04:29.390 --> 04:29.850
Shoot it!

04:31.440 --> 04:34.020
CROWD:
Five, four,

04:34.390 --> 04:36.480
three, two...

04:50.460 --> 04:52.460
(applause)

04:56.460 --> 04:57.960
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.920
I-I knew the shot would go in
the moment it left my fingers,

05:00.300 --> 05:01.830
you see,
'cause, well,

05:02.250 --> 05:03.840
it was such a smooth release.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.340
Oh, you were
amazing.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.340
Oh, well,
I wouldn't say amazing.

05:08.340 --> 05:09.760
But if you want to...
(chuckles)

05:10.060 --> 05:12.430
COLETTE:
You'll probably be
in the Hall of Fame!

05:12.600 --> 05:15.680
Well, you know, uh,
I am one of the first

05:15.680 --> 05:17.180
to perfect the jump shot.

05:17.180 --> 05:19.190
I mean, you might say
that it's Bill Sharman,

05:19.190 --> 05:21.190
Easy Ed McCauley
of the Boston Celtics

05:21.190 --> 05:24.690
and Richie Cunningham
of the Jefferson High Ducks!

05:30.000 --> 05:32.330
Richie,
congrats-a-mundo!

05:32.620 --> 05:35.200
Oh, thanks.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.700
Thanks a lot, Fonz.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.620
Uh, this is Colette.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.090
I'm charmed.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.090
Doing pretty good,
huh, Fonz?

05:41.090 --> 05:41.960
Looks like it.

05:42.260 --> 05:45.710
Fonz, uh, I got a girl
for you, too, you know.

05:46.010 --> 05:49.100
Uh, Colette,
excuse me.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.100
You want to come right
over here with me?

05:55.100 --> 05:57.110
Now, do my ears
deceive me,

05:57.110 --> 06:00.610
or did I hear you ask
if I need a date?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.110
Oh... Oh, yeah,
I did, Fonz.

06:02.110 --> 06:04.110
I'm sorry, I just got
a little carried away.

06:04.110 --> 06:05.620
Whoa.

06:05.620 --> 06:07.620
I tell you, it's weird
because I'm an instant hero.

06:07.620 --> 06:08.620
Cunningham...
You know what I mean?

06:08.620 --> 06:10.620
Well, it's very
exciting for me.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.460
The girls want to be
with me all the time,

06:12.710 --> 06:14.790
and-and they want to be
around to touch me,

06:14.790 --> 06:16.740
and I just never experienced
that kind of excitement...

06:21.800 --> 06:23.300
(phone ringing)
Now, now, Cunningham,

06:23.300 --> 06:24.800
I am very proud
that you are

06:24.800 --> 06:27.300
excluding yourself
from the humdrum life.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.590
But I think you're getting
a little carried away here.

06:29.810 --> 06:32.390
All right, all right, Fonz.

06:32.390 --> 06:33.390
So the shot was lucky.

06:33.390 --> 06:35.400
I mean, I figure
what difference does it make?

06:35.400 --> 06:36.900
'Cause the girls don't know.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.900
And besides that, now that
I got a little confidence,

06:38.900 --> 06:41.900
I think that if Coach Pelino
puts me back into another game,

06:41.900 --> 06:43.770
I just might make
another last minute shot.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.150
The coach called.

06:45.150 --> 06:46.160
He's been looking
all over for you.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.160
He told me to tell you
to get home

06:48.160 --> 06:52.160
and get all the rest you can,
because Calvey busted his ankle,

06:52.160 --> 06:54.660
and you're starting
the whole game!

06:58.670 --> 07:00.750
Starting the whole game?

07:00.750 --> 07:02.260
This could be
embarrassing.

07:02.260 --> 07:05.260
Well, how does it feel
to be king of the court?

07:05.260 --> 07:06.760
Starting a whole game.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.550
Hey, hey, enjoy it
while you can, Jack.

07:09.800 --> 07:10.880
Yeah.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.380
Yeah, I guess you're right.

07:12.380 --> 07:15.850
I mean, like they say,
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Sic transit gloria mundi{\r}.</font></font></i>

07:18.860 --> 07:19.860
People say that?

07:22.310 --> 07:23.810
Oh, well, actually
it's Latin, see.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.780
It means that, uh,
all glory is fleeting.

07:27.150 --> 07:29.150
Yeah, well, glory till
Monday, you know.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.620
Oh, right, Fonz.

07:31.620 --> 07:33.450
Oh, Fonz,

07:33.700 --> 07:37.290
now, you sure you don't want me
to set you up with Claudia here?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.290
(chuckles)

07:38.290 --> 07:40.290
Uh, Rich, listen,
just one time,

07:40.290 --> 07:42.800
I would love to try it
just by myself, okay?

07:43.300 --> 07:44.050
(snaps)

07:47.330 --> 07:49.840
Uh, like they say, glory
may be fleeting, you know?

07:49.840 --> 07:50.840
(chuckles):
Yeah.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.340
But the Fonz
goes on and on.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.840
I think he's got it.
I think he's got it.

07:55.840 --> 07:56.840
Whoa!

08:00.180 --> 08:02.180
Hey, Colette?

08:02.180 --> 08:04.180
Want to go up to
Inspiration Point with me?

08:04.180 --> 08:05.690
I'll show you
my fake.

08:05.690 --> 08:06.690
(chuckles)

08:06.690 --> 08:08.190
Oh, Richie!

08:08.190 --> 08:10.690
You're such a jock!
(giggles)

08:10.690 --> 08:12.690
Yeah, yeah, I am.

08:15.700 --> 08:17.700
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

08:17.700 --> 08:19.700
You must be
Cunningham,

08:19.700 --> 08:22.200
Jefferson's new
hotshot ball player?

08:22.200 --> 08:24.200
(clears throat)

08:26.210 --> 08:28.210
(glass shattering)

08:30.210 --> 08:32.210
Al?

08:35.210 --> 08:36.720
I do my best.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.190
(singers hum <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Happy Days
theme melody{\r})</font></font></i>

08:48.140 --> 08:50.530
Well, Richard, you haven't
touched your dinner.

08:50.810 --> 08:53.400
Well, I'm sorry, Mom,
but I'm a little nervous.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.400
Starting and-and playing
the whole game and...

08:56.400 --> 08:58.240
I-I think I'll just
skip dinner, okay?

08:58.540 --> 08:59.120
Oh, why?

08:59.620 --> 09:00.620
Now, don't worry.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.490
We're gonna be there
rooting for you.

09:02.790 --> 09:05.290
Now, basketball stars
need their dinner.

09:05.630 --> 09:07.210
Oh.

09:07.210 --> 09:09.050
Well, if I see one,
I'll send him over.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.830
(phone ringing)

09:12.840 --> 09:15.340
You know, Richard,
you're a good basketball player.

09:15.340 --> 09:17.840
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be on the team.
Hello.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.840
You want to speak to

09:19.840 --> 09:22.850
Luscious Legs
Cunningham?

09:22.850 --> 09:24.350
That must be
for me.
That must
be for me.

09:24.350 --> 09:26.850
No.

09:26.850 --> 09:28.180
It's...
Luscious Legs, huh?

09:28.430 --> 09:29.520
MARION:
It's for Richard.

09:32.770 --> 09:34.270
He does have
cute legs.

09:34.270 --> 09:35.780
Oh, Mom... Mom...

09:36.280 --> 09:37.280
It's a girl.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.780
Well, I figured that.

09:38.780 --> 09:39.780
(clears throat)

09:39.780 --> 09:40.780
Hi.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.280
Yeah, this is
Richie Cunningham.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.280
Uh, Sheena who?

09:47.290 --> 09:49.290
DuBois?

09:49.290 --> 09:52.290
Sheena DuBois?

09:52.290 --> 09:53.790
(clears throat)

09:56.300 --> 09:57.800
Hello, there,
Sheena DuBois.

09:57.800 --> 09:58.800
(chuckles)

09:59.220 --> 10:00.300
No, no.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.800
I don't believe
I've ever met you.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.800
Ask her if she has a brother,
and we'll double.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.800
Mom! Dad!

10:05.190 --> 10:06.270
Joanie, sit down.

10:06.270 --> 10:07.770
Here, sweetie.

10:07.770 --> 10:09.280
(Richie clears throat
anxiously)

10:09.280 --> 10:10.280
Oh, yes, yes.

10:10.780 --> 10:12.610
This is the star Jefferson High
basketball player.

10:14.900 --> 10:16.780
Oh, you-you want to
meet with me tonight?

10:17.070 --> 10:19.650
Well, I-I have a game and...

10:19.650 --> 10:20.650
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

10:20.650 --> 10:22.150
Maybe we can work something out.

10:22.150 --> 10:25.160
Uh, how about if I meet you
after the game,

10:25.160 --> 10:29.160
and that way,
I can tell you how I did.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.660
What?

10:31.660 --> 10:34.670
You can do what?

10:34.670 --> 10:35.670
Oh, my!

10:35.670 --> 10:37.170
I'll be there in 15 minutes!

10:37.550 --> 10:41.090
Look, I'm sorry,
but I just got to go ahead--

10:41.090 --> 10:42.640
Uh, go ahead
and eat your dessert.

10:42.640 --> 10:43.640
I'll see you at the game.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.850
I just, I-I got to go.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.180
♪ Bye, bye love ♪

10:47.180 --> 10:48.650
(music stops)

10:48.650 --> 10:50.350
♪ Bye, bye, sweet ♪

10:50.850 --> 10:52.850
(music stops)

10:52.850 --> 10:55.350
♪ Bye, bye, love ♪

10:55.350 --> 10:57.860
(music stops)

10:57.860 --> 10:58.860
All right, Al, come on, huh?!

10:58.860 --> 11:00.360
I'm bored out here!

11:00.360 --> 11:02.360
Rah, rah!

11:08.370 --> 11:09.870
We are going to a
basketball game,

11:09.870 --> 11:11.290
not an Eskimo
wedding, huh?

11:11.670 --> 11:14.260
I know, Fonzie.

11:14.260 --> 11:16.090
I just got caught up
in the spirit.

11:16.290 --> 11:17.880
Let me ask you
a question.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.850
Does my nose detect
camphor balls?

11:23.270 --> 11:25.770
I thought I got them all out.

11:25.770 --> 11:27.720
Yeah, just don't sit
close to me, all right?

11:28.100 --> 11:29.190
Let's go.
Let's go.

11:29.190 --> 11:31.690
Oh, Al, I want you
to remember one thing.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.190
We're going
on my bike, right?

11:33.190 --> 11:34.690
Okay, I want you
to lean forward.

11:34.690 --> 11:37.700
I don't want to do a wheelie
all the way to the gymnasium.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.200
Hi, Fonz.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.700
Al, what's the bear wearing?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.710
The bear--
what's the bear wearing?

11:45.710 --> 11:46.790
FONZIE:
Yeah, right.

11:46.790 --> 11:47.870
What are you doing here?

11:47.870 --> 11:48.820
Well, Fonz, Fonz,

11:48.820 --> 11:50.880
this-this girl called
me up at my house.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.380
Yeah?
She wanted to
meet me here.

11:52.380 --> 11:55.880
And she said such things
to me on the telephone.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.380
(chuckles):
Whoa, ho...

11:57.380 --> 11:58.380
AL:
Here, Rich.

11:58.380 --> 11:59.890
Here's the keys.

11:59.890 --> 12:01.390
Lock up when
you leave.

12:01.390 --> 12:03.390
Fonz, I'll wait for
you on your bike,

12:03.390 --> 12:04.890
leaning forward.
Yeah, right.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.890
Hey, thanks
a lot, Al.

12:06.890 --> 12:07.890
Uh, Richie.
Yeah?

12:07.890 --> 12:08.890
You got 20 minutes.

12:08.890 --> 12:10.900
I suggest you go
right for the highlights.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.650
Yeah.

12:19.940 --> 12:20.940
(weak laugh)

12:32.280 --> 12:34.290
Can I loan you
a nickel?
Huh?

12:34.700 --> 12:35.790
Oh, no, no,

12:35.790 --> 12:38.790
I was just fixing it
here and I don't--

12:38.790 --> 12:41.710
Oh, you must be
Sheena DuBois.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.930
In the flesh.

12:47.220 --> 12:49.100
You've got such a way
with words.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.110
Listen,
Luscious Legs,

12:54.610 --> 12:57.610
why don't you forget
that dumb old game?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.450
Why don't you and I
go to the movies?

12:59.650 --> 13:02.230
Oh, no, I-I couldn't.

13:03.730 --> 13:05.730
What's playing?

13:05.730 --> 13:07.740
Oh, no, no, no,

13:07.740 --> 13:09.740
I-I gotta go
to the game.

13:09.740 --> 13:11.570
Listen, would you like
to come with me?

13:11.790 --> 13:13.380
I hate games.
Oh.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.380
I love athletes.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.880
But the movies...
last row...

13:18.380 --> 13:19.670
all alone.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.500
We won't even have
to watch the movie.

13:26.010 --> 13:28.010
I wonder if this happens
to Bob Cousy.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.340
Oh, no, no, wait, now
wait, uh, tiger--

13:32.850 --> 13:34.350
I mean, Sheena,
Sheena.

13:34.850 --> 13:37.350
No, listen, see, uh,
I have to go to the game.

13:37.850 --> 13:38.350
Sure?

13:38.850 --> 13:39.850
Yeah, because people
are counting on me.

13:39.850 --> 13:41.350
I have to show up.

13:41.350 --> 13:43.860
Well, too bad.

13:43.860 --> 13:45.610
Biff. Rocky.

13:46.110 --> 13:47.610
Oh, no, no, please,
no nicknames.

13:48.110 --> 13:48.940
Just call me Richie.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.780
Biff, Rocky.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.780
Well, okay, Biff's cute,
I like Biff.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.780
Uh-huh.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.290
(clears throat)

13:57.790 --> 13:59.290
Biff?

13:59.790 --> 14:01.290
Rocky.

14:01.790 --> 14:03.290
I don't know
who they are,

14:03.290 --> 14:06.300
but I got a basketball
game, I can't stay.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.800
I could probably chat
for a while.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.360
POTSIE (over P.A.):
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">It's been an exciting evening,
and we're nearing the en{\r}d</font></font></i>

14:24.730 --> 14:26.320
of the first quarter
of the championship game.

14:26.820 --> 14:29.290
(crowd shouting)

14:29.700 --> 14:30.570
Donnally tries a 20-footer.
He misses.

14:30.950 --> 14:33.120
It's tapped in! Okay!

14:33.620 --> 14:35.460
(cheering and applause)

14:35.710 --> 14:37.290
There's still two minutes
in the first quarter,

14:37.290 --> 14:39.250
and still no sign
of Richie Cunningham.

14:39.660 --> 14:41.250
ALL (chanting):
We want Cunningham!

14:41.250 --> 14:42.750
We want Cunningham!

14:42.750 --> 14:44.050
We want Cunningham!

14:45.330 --> 14:47.640
Hey, Red,

14:47.840 --> 14:49.420
just make yourself
comfortable;

14:49.920 --> 14:51.340
you aren't going anywhere
till the game's over.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.260
(nervous laughter)

14:55.760 --> 14:59.570
Oh, boy, you must think
I'm pretty stupid.

14:59.820 --> 15:01.180
I mean,

15:01.520 --> 15:03.600
you really think you can get
some sexy chick

15:03.600 --> 15:06.110
to call up Luscious Legs
Cunningham,

15:06.110 --> 15:08.110
come on with some
real sweet talk,

15:08.110 --> 15:09.910
and-and you really think
I'm gonna buy that?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.160
You bought it.

15:11.530 --> 15:13.110
Looks that way, doesn't it?

15:19.750 --> 15:20.750
Hey! Hey, you know what
I'm gonna do to you?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.120
What?

15:22.420 --> 15:25.010
I'm gonna pop you one
so you'll stop playing games.

15:31.010 --> 15:32.510
Now, I would
let him go

15:32.510 --> 15:34.520
unless you want to make
medical history.

15:36.020 --> 15:37.970
Good choice.

15:38.300 --> 15:39.860
Very nice.
Come here, Rich.

15:40.390 --> 15:41.890
Now I'm telling you,

15:41.890 --> 15:44.390
you got an entire
gymnasium filled
with people,

15:44.390 --> 15:47.200
and you're here with
your new friends
playing around.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.450
Now, I want you to get
lost, all right?

15:49.820 --> 15:51.400
Hey, nobody moves.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.400
It's still four
against two.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.400
Five against two.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.410
Oh no, I-I don't think
you understand, see?

15:56.410 --> 15:57.910
Now I'm gonna save
you for last,

15:58.410 --> 16:00.410
and what we're gonna
do we're gonna do
alone, so sit down!

16:03.300 --> 16:04.880
You're the greatest, Fonz.
Heyyy.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.880
Listen, will...
will you lock up
when you're done?

16:07.880 --> 16:10.250
Sure. Sure, I will.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.140
Now go dribble
your heart out.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.140
All right, now, now,
just before we get--

16:19.140 --> 16:20.650
hold it, hold it, hold it.

16:20.650 --> 16:22.150
Just before we get
started, all right,

16:22.150 --> 16:24.650
since there's so many of you
and just one of me,

16:24.650 --> 16:26.650
I'd like to warm up
a little bit, okay,

16:26.650 --> 16:27.650
so I'm gonna be right back

16:27.650 --> 16:29.660
as soon as I finish
warming up, okay?

16:29.660 --> 16:31.660
Just...

16:45.700 --> 16:48.210
(sultry melody playing)

16:56.800 --> 16:58.800
(crowd cheering and whistling)

16:59.100 --> 17:01.100
POTSIE (over P.A.):
Donnally shoots... misses.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.110
Hey, look, Cunningham's here!

17:03.110 --> 17:05.109
(cheering and applause)

17:05.109 --> 17:07.060
Cunningham, where
have you been?

17:07.390 --> 17:08.980
Coach, I was kidnapped!

17:08.980 --> 17:10.980
Oh, yeah, and I'm
Elliot Ness.

17:10.980 --> 17:12.310
Get in there for
Whitkowski!

17:12.560 --> 17:13.150
Right...

17:13.650 --> 17:14.650
POTSIE:
Cunningham's in.

17:14.650 --> 17:16.569
(cheering, drum beating)

17:16.950 --> 17:19.540
He's so popular.

17:24.380 --> 17:26.460
(cheering)

17:29.880 --> 17:30.970
ALL:
Fight!

17:30.970 --> 17:32.300
Fight!

17:35.340 --> 17:36.420
Come on!
Come on!

17:39.840 --> 17:41.230
(cheering and applause)

17:44.900 --> 17:46.650
POTSIE (over P.A.):
It's Jefferson's ball.

17:46.650 --> 17:48.650
They're working for a good shot.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.650
They're passing it around,
looking for an opening...

17:50.650 --> 17:52.650
looking for an opening...

17:52.650 --> 17:54.160
Wait a minute!

17:54.160 --> 17:55.660
Donnally shoots... misses.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.160
Fillmore rebounds.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.030
Wait, Cunningham steals
the ball.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.950
He drives.

18:01.450 --> 18:02.330
He scores!

18:02.610 --> 18:05.030
(cheering and applause)

18:05.330 --> 18:06.790
Jefferson's in
a full-court press.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.700
(whistle blows)
Oh! Foul!

18:09.200 --> 18:10.710
(crowd moans)
It's on Johnson.

18:11.210 --> 18:13.590
Wait, it's his fifth--
he's out of the game.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.430
Al, I don't know
who Jefferson has left

18:15.430 --> 18:17.430
on the bench to put in,
do you know?
Uh, let's see,

18:17.930 --> 18:19.720
uh, Ralph Malph,
number 25.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.470
Hey, you.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.470
You!

18:24.970 --> 18:25.970
Yeah, you.

18:25.970 --> 18:27.310
Malph, Ralph Malph.

18:27.560 --> 18:28.640
I know.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.480
Get off your warm-ups,
you're in the game.

18:30.730 --> 18:33.310
Oh, thanks a lot, Coach,
you won't regret it.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.230
I never play.

18:38.530 --> 18:41.120
Get in your uniform!

18:41.620 --> 18:42.540
Time-out!

18:42.910 --> 18:43.990
(horn blows)

18:43.990 --> 18:45.320
Jefferson calls time-out.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.210
Oh, Fonz!

18:49.210 --> 18:50.210
Hey, listen,
are you okay?

18:50.710 --> 18:52.210
Yeah, of course I'm okay.

18:52.210 --> 18:53.170
You remember Sheena
here, right?

18:53.550 --> 18:56.000
Yeah, but she was
with the other side...

18:56.250 --> 18:57.840
Oh, yeah, she fell in
with a bad crowd.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.340
She had bad habits.

18:59.340 --> 19:00.840
I'll break her of 'em,
all right?

19:00.840 --> 19:03.340
I mean, she's got some
very good qualities,

19:03.340 --> 19:05.180
which I'm sure you heard
on the phone.

19:05.430 --> 19:06.510
Yeah.

19:06.510 --> 19:08.350
All right, get in there
and do your stuff.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.680
All right, Fonz.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.180
Hey, Al, listen,

19:12.180 --> 19:14.190
you got new bathrooms,
much larger.

19:14.190 --> 19:15.190
You're gonna love 'em.

19:15.190 --> 19:17.070
I'll explain to you later, okay?

19:17.360 --> 19:18.440
Okay, I'm ready, Coach.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.440
Malph, get in there!

19:20.440 --> 19:21.940
All right.

19:21.940 --> 19:23.450
Let's go,
all right, guys.

19:23.450 --> 19:26.420
POTSIE:
Coming in the game
for Jefferson, Ralph Malph!

19:28.450 --> 19:30.040
(whistle blows)
It's Jefferson's ball.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.040
They're coming down court.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.450
Passing it around...

19:32.790 --> 19:35.840
Ralph looks like
the best one.

19:36.180 --> 19:37.630
Hey, Coach,

19:37.960 --> 19:39.040
I'm doing
real good, huh?

19:39.040 --> 19:41.050
I'm sticking to him
like glue!

19:41.050 --> 19:43.050
We got the ball!

19:43.050 --> 19:45.050
Oh, right,
I'm on offense.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.890
Get away from me!

19:49.470 --> 19:50.560
POTSIE:
Wow, it's 15 seconds to go

19:50.560 --> 19:52.560
and Jefferson better set up
for a good shot.

19:52.940 --> 19:55.030
(shouting)

19:55.030 --> 19:57.030
(whistle blows)

19:57.030 --> 19:58.980
Foul, he got fouled!
He got fouled!

19:58.980 --> 20:00.530
Foul!

20:00.530 --> 20:02.530
POTSIE: Okay!
Let's go, Rich.

20:03.540 --> 20:05.040
All right, come on,
Richie.

20:07.990 --> 20:09.580
There's one second left.

20:09.580 --> 20:11.580
Cunningham needs to make
both free throws

20:11.580 --> 20:12.880
to send the game
into overtime.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.090
Come on, Richie,
you can do it!

20:25.090 --> 20:26.560
(buzzer)

20:26.560 --> 20:28.140
(whistle blowing)

20:30.180 --> 20:32.680
POTSIE:
Fillmore calls a time-out.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.350
You all right,
Cunningham?

20:37.350 --> 20:38.940
Yeah.
Huh? You all right?
You loose?

20:38.940 --> 20:40.940
You want to sit down?
You want to rest?
No, I'm fine, Coach.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.610
You-you-you sure
you're all right?
I'm fine.

20:42.610 --> 20:44.190
If we win... (chuckles)

20:44.190 --> 20:45.690
I will have fulfilled
a lifetime dream,

20:45.690 --> 20:47.160
right, Cunningham?

20:47.160 --> 20:49.250
If we lose, well,
my life's over.

20:49.250 --> 20:51.250
But... don't worry
about it, huh?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.750
Just don't worry.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.420
It doesn't mean anything
at all, okay?

20:54.420 --> 20:55.500
Coach...
Yeah?

20:55.500 --> 20:57.340
Maybe you should
sit down.
Yeah, I ought to sit down.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.920
Can I, can I sit down here?
Let me, let me sit...

20:58.920 --> 21:00.430
Give me a place to sit!

21:00.430 --> 21:02.430
The coach never has
a place to sit.

21:03.930 --> 21:04.430
(buzzer)

21:04.430 --> 21:05.930
POTSIE:
This is it.

21:05.930 --> 21:08.930
Jefferson's season rests
on Cunningham's shoulders.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.940
(referee speaks
indistinctly)

21:26.490 --> 21:28.320
POTSIE:
He makes it!

21:28.320 --> 21:30.320
(crowd cheering)

21:30.320 --> 21:32.540
Jefferson is one point away

21:32.540 --> 21:36.300
from tying the game and
setting up an overtime.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.380
Richie takes a deep breath.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.880
He bounces the ball.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.470
He bounces it again.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.050
He bounces it a third time.

21:47.470 --> 21:49.060
Sorry, Rich. Guys.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.560
All right.

22:02.650 --> 22:05.360
(buzzer)
POTSIE:
Oh, no! Fillmore wins.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.360
They go to the state
championship.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.660
FANS (chanting):
We're number one!

22:09.660 --> 22:13.580
We're number one!
We're number one!

22:13.580 --> 22:15.170
My life's over.

22:19.670 --> 22:24.180
Richard, Richard, you just
did terrific, dear.

22:24.180 --> 22:26.430
Now you deserve
another chance.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.510
You made 12 points.

22:28.510 --> 22:30.520
POTSIE:
It's okay, Rich.

22:30.520 --> 22:33.020
Get changed, we'll wait
for you outside.

22:46.150 --> 22:48.650
Hey, you gave it
your best shot.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.130
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Sic transit
gloria mundi{\r}.</font></font></i>

23:03.080 --> 23:05.080
That is a Latin phrase.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.670
It means you're gonna
stay at my place

23:06.670 --> 23:08.170
at least till Monday.

23:08.170 --> 23:09.000
Whoa!

23:24.020 --> 23:25.940
(sighs)

23:30.660 --> 23:33.660
Sure, now I make it.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.670
Want to go home?

23:42.670 --> 23:45.290
In a minute, Dad.

23:45.290 --> 23:48.040
Tough game.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.630
A free throw.

23:49.630 --> 23:51.630
I missed a lousy
free throw.

23:51.630 --> 23:52.960
Well...

23:52.960 --> 23:54.050
you make a great shot,

23:54.050 --> 23:56.050
and you're a hero,
and you miss one

23:56.050 --> 23:57.850
and you're just one
of the many that tried.

23:57.850 --> 24:01.110
Well, Dad, that's not
very comforting.

24:01.110 --> 24:02.690
Look, Richard,

24:02.690 --> 24:05.690
even the best of them
have bad games.

24:05.690 --> 24:08.700
You know, like Ralph Branca
throwing up a home run ball

24:08.700 --> 24:10.200
to Bobby Thomson
in the play-offs.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.200
And Mickey Owen missing
the third strike

24:13.200 --> 24:15.200
and losing
the World Series.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.210
Yeah, but, Dad, this
game was important.

24:17.210 --> 24:19.210
Oh.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.710
I tell you something,

24:22.710 --> 24:25.210
I think you're being a little
too hard on yourself.

24:25.210 --> 24:28.220
You know, after all,
you were a hero for a week.

24:28.220 --> 24:30.220
You had your moment,

24:30.220 --> 24:32.220
and that's more
than most people.

24:34.720 --> 24:38.230
I guess I just...
wanted it to go on.

24:38.230 --> 24:40.230
I know.

24:40.230 --> 24:42.230
Come on, let's go home.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.740
Here...

24:46.740 --> 24:49.690
have a Lifesaver,
it'll make you feel better.
