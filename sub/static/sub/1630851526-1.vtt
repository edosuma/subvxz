WEBVTT

00:03.120 --> 00:04.120
Ah!

00:04.160 --> 00:05.400
Nh, spla. Ooh!

00:05.440 --> 00:07.040
BELL DINGS

00:09.120 --> 00:10.360
Is this a joke?

00:10.400 --> 00:11.400
Yeah!

00:14.240 --> 00:15.480
Mm-mm! Oh!

00:19.600 --> 00:21.120
Oh!

00:21.160 --> 00:23.320
Oh, I like that!

00:23.360 --> 00:24.560
Oh! Wow. Mm!

00:24.600 --> 00:28.360
This programme contains strong
language and adult humour

00:28.400 --> 00:31.360
Taskmaster was recorded in
accordance with all social

00:31.400 --> 00:34.360
distancing guidelines in place at
the time of filming

00:34.400 --> 00:35.880
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:35.920 --> 00:37.920
Hello, one and all!

00:37.960 --> 00:40.320
I'm Greg Davies,
and I am the Taskmaster,

00:40.360 --> 00:42.040
and this is Taskmaster!

00:42.080 --> 00:44.760
It's a brand-new series
with a brand-new cast

00:44.800 --> 00:46.560
and a brand-new set of tasks.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.440
But I'm not brand-new.

00:48.480 --> 00:49.880
Quite the contrary.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.240
I'm a living relic,
an almighty deity,

00:52.280 --> 00:54.400
resurrected time and time again.

00:54.440 --> 00:58.880
I'm not as good as God,
but I sure am one swell guy.

00:58.920 --> 01:03.960
So, who are the five so desperate to
get their hands on my golden goblet

01:04.000 --> 01:07.480
that they would go against
the explicit advice of their agents?

01:07.520 --> 01:10.920
Well, let's cast our eyes
across five faces of fear,

01:10.960 --> 01:13.720
and please welcome Alan Davies...

01:13.760 --> 01:15.080
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

01:15.120 --> 01:17.640
..Desiree Burch...
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

01:17.680 --> 01:20.200
..Guz Khan...
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

01:20.240 --> 01:22.560
..Morgana Robinson...
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

01:22.600 --> 01:25.200
..and Victoria Coren-Mitchell.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.080
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

01:27.120 --> 01:28.760
And now, to my assistant.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.000
Usually I introduce him
in a derogatory way,

01:31.040 --> 01:33.920
but, for a change, I thought
he could read the introduction

01:33.960 --> 01:35.000
I've written for him.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.280
Over to you.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.040
My name is Alex and, in interviews,

01:38.080 --> 01:39.960
I pretend Greg and I
are friends in real life.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.800
But, in truth,
we barely know each other.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.760
Also, I've got a little winkie.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.000
It's little Alex Horne!

01:46.040 --> 01:48.880
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

01:48.920 --> 01:51.400
Do you want to play a quick game
of "whose face am I sitting on"?

01:51.440 --> 01:53.400
Yes, cos I know this is
the pre-prepared banter

01:53.440 --> 01:55.240
you've got for us.
It's a little game for you.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.680
I thought you'd enjoy this.
Whose face am I sitting on, Greg?

01:57.720 --> 01:59.800
I don't know, Alex.
You can have 120 guesses.

01:59.840 --> 02:00.840
OK.

02:00.880 --> 02:03.080
LAUGHTER

02:03.120 --> 02:04.640
I can do an impression of them. OK.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.680
"Oh, would you like a present?"

02:06.720 --> 02:07.840
Er, Father Christmas!

02:07.880 --> 02:09.400
Yes! Father Christmas.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.160
That was really good.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.240
You can't sit on
Father Christmas' face.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.840
Oh, yes, you can.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.080
LAUGHTER

02:17.120 --> 02:19.000
Right, same old prize task, is it?

02:19.040 --> 02:20.560
Yes, way, Jose.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.360
And for this first episode,
they've been asked to bring in

02:23.400 --> 02:26.120
the thing that, if you put it
in a bag and sit on it,

02:26.160 --> 02:27.760
it would feel the nicest.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.520
There are five enormous points
available for the best thing

02:30.560 --> 02:32.960
that would feel the nicest
when sat on in a big bag,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.800
and the winner of tonight's episode
will win all five things,

02:35.840 --> 02:37.720
and therefore require
an even bigger bag.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.840
And a much bigger bottom.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.560
This task, to me,
feels fraught with dangers,

02:42.600 --> 02:46.200
but I know I'm going to start
with a mature man who I know

02:46.240 --> 02:48.440
won't have gone route one.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.680
Alan Davies.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.720
Welcome to the show,
what have you brought in?

02:51.760 --> 02:53.600
It's an inflatable cushion...

02:53.640 --> 02:56.120
OK. ..which I have for
the kids in the car.

02:56.160 --> 02:58.520
But as an optional extra,

02:58.560 --> 02:59.840
an electric toothbrush.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.840
A car seat and a toothbrush.
There you go, Greg.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.800
You probably would put
the toothbrush inside the cushion.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.200
It's got a little zip.

03:06.240 --> 03:09.920
Then you turn it on and, of course,
it buzzes and vibrates.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.280
And that's always a bonus
in a seat, isn't it?

03:13.320 --> 03:16.040
Do you imagine the toothbrush
to be lengthways?

03:16.080 --> 03:17.680
Of course. Or sideways?

03:17.720 --> 03:19.480
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.400
LAUGHTER

03:21.440 --> 03:24.200
I expect questions, but come on,
there's a level of common sense.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.640
You'd have to recharge it,

03:25.680 --> 03:28.920
so there's a limited amount of time
for you to enjoy the vibration

03:28.960 --> 03:30.480
of your seat, Alan.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.800
And that, my friend, is where
the whole thing falls down.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.840
LAUGHTER

03:38.200 --> 03:39.680
Des... Desiree.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.280
The most comfortable thing,
I think, on planet Earth are boobs.

03:43.320 --> 03:46.720
and you can't put human boobs
in a bag because...sick.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.800
But you can get a replica
of those in a bag.

03:49.840 --> 03:54.000
So, what we got were those chicken
cutlets, like, that replicate boobs.

03:54.040 --> 03:55.800
Chicken fillets?
Yeah, those little guys.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.200
Oh, you mean that thing you...?
Yeah, that go bloop, right?

03:58.240 --> 03:59.560
And they feel boob-like in a bag.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.320
Here's a bunch of boobs for you.
OK.

04:01.360 --> 04:05.760
ALAN: Static boobs, no variety,
no variation, no rotation.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.440
Well, I mean, you can go to a couple
different shops, if you want,

04:08.480 --> 04:10.120
and get different boobs, all right?

04:10.160 --> 04:12.200
To be honest, they can all laugh,

04:12.240 --> 04:15.120
but we've managed to get guys
home with those. Yeah! So...

04:15.160 --> 04:16.480
LAUGHTER

04:16.520 --> 04:19.720
You haven't managed to get any guys
home with them in a bag.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.440
Guz, what have you brought?

04:24.480 --> 04:27.480
I bought a chair, and then,
I put it in a bag.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.280
Here is the chair.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.520
It's the same one as
he's sitting on at the moment.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.680
Right, so he didn't bring a chair,
he's just...

04:34.720 --> 04:36.400
No, I might've bought it,
you don't know.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.480
It's important that you and I
form a bond of honesty

04:38.520 --> 04:39.880
at this stage in the series.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.800
So, I ask you this now...

04:42.960 --> 04:44.600
..last minute, did you think,

04:44.640 --> 04:46.840
"I'm just going to say
I brought this chair?"

04:46.880 --> 04:49.200
Yeah, a little bit. Right, good.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.000
Last place. Morgana.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.960
LAUGHTER

04:53.000 --> 04:54.320
What have you brought in?

04:54.360 --> 04:56.560
I've brought in a spinning
washing machine.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.040
But it's got to be on spin,
not just any old washing machine.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.640
OK. But it's got to be, you know,
on "vibrate" for the last bit.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.760
And we can see it spinning
right now, Greg. OK.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.320
There it is. See, there it goes.
That's going to... Yeah, yeah.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.840
I've got... Same vibe.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.600
Same vibe, but a little bit
less subtle, I think, Morgana,

05:11.640 --> 05:12.640
but there you are.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.680
I put it to you,
it's a hugely uncomfortable seat.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.200
I just think it's a bit like -
I mean, I'm not saying I want to

05:17.240 --> 05:18.920
spend all night on it,
but I think...

05:18.960 --> 05:21.160
How long do you want to spend on it?
Five, ten?

05:21.200 --> 05:23.760
LAUGHTER

05:23.800 --> 05:25.240
I think it'll give me bum problems.

05:25.280 --> 05:28.000
Do you really think? I think it'll
tighten everything up. It isn't.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.360
I think it'll do the opposite.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.120
I think it'll work things out
that I wouldn't want worked out.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.840
Victoria. Yes.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.360
You got a nice sitting thing?

05:35.400 --> 05:36.680
Diamonds.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.000
Interesting.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.920
All this soft things and squishy
things, and vibrating things

05:41.960 --> 05:43.280
are all very well.

05:43.320 --> 05:47.560
I'm looking for the greater comfort
of long-term financial security.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.080
LAUGHTER

05:51.160 --> 05:53.880
So, these are the diamonds that
the winner is going to sit on.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.400
Quite a few.
You've brought those in, Victoria?

05:56.440 --> 05:58.040
No, of course not.

05:58.080 --> 06:01.720
If I had that many diamonds,
I wouldn't be here.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.040
So, what you're offering up
is the concept?

06:04.080 --> 06:07.800
You asked what, if you put them
in a bag and sat on them,

06:07.840 --> 06:10.440
would feel the nicest -
and I say diamonds.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.200
As a rule...
I don't enjoy this kind of attitude.

06:19.520 --> 06:23.000
There's an over-confidence to it
that I've stamped out of Alex.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.080
LAUGHTER

06:26.120 --> 06:27.880
Thank you.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.400
Here are my judgments.

06:30.440 --> 06:34.000
In last place, guess who?

06:34.040 --> 06:36.000
Is it Guz Khan? It's Guz Khan!

06:36.040 --> 06:37.520
One point to Guz...

06:37.560 --> 06:39.720
Guz, you're in the lead currently.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.960
Obviously, er, the washing machine,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.160
the second-laziest thing here,
two points.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.360
Controversially...

06:45.400 --> 06:46.800
Oh, now this is interesting.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.880
..it's the diamond-bum girl,
three points. Oh!

06:50.920 --> 06:53.720
Above a lifetime's supply of
diamonds, I'm going to have

06:53.760 --> 06:55.120
a vibrating toothbrush.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.040
So, four points to Alan Davies.
Four points.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.920
And five points to Desiree!

06:58.960 --> 07:02.280
Congratulations. And we're off!
Desiree, five points.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.360
Well done, Desiree.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

07:05.400 --> 07:08.200
Whoo! Feel the rush!

07:08.240 --> 07:09.800
LAUGHTER

07:09.840 --> 07:12.120
What's first on our agenda?

07:12.160 --> 07:16.120
OK, we are starting with a new
non-non-contact sport.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.000
MORGANA: Where's Alex?

07:38.200 --> 07:39.560
Is he off sick?

07:42.960 --> 07:44.600
Cheeky cacti, yeah.

07:44.640 --> 07:45.880
OK.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.800
Thought I was going to
call it a cactuses.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.720
It's cacti.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.000
ALAN: It's not a real cactus.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.000
"Strike Alex with a ball."

07:58.040 --> 07:59.520
"Alex may not run..."

07:59.560 --> 08:00.800
"..Hide..."

08:00.840 --> 08:02.600
"..or leave the Taskmaster grounds.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.960
"Fastest wins.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.480
So, I've got to find
the little BLEEP.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.640
VICTORIA: "Your time starts now."

08:13.640 --> 08:16.000
But do I have to find the ball?

08:16.040 --> 08:17.320
Where's Alex?

08:17.360 --> 08:19.840
APPLAUSE

08:22.280 --> 08:24.120
A sneaky task, Greg.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.560
Why is it sneaky?

08:25.600 --> 08:27.840
Well, they had a little
camera there. Yeah.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.720
And I could see what the camera was
showing on my little screen here,

08:31.760 --> 08:34.400
so I could see where they were
moving, but they didn't necessarily

08:34.440 --> 08:35.560
know that I could see that.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.920
Well, I don't want to mess around,
I just want to get going.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.080
Who are we seeing first?

08:39.120 --> 08:42.600
The first two people we're going to
see share their names with old men,

08:42.640 --> 08:43.800
it's Des and Vic.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.960
DESIREE: Erm...er...

08:48.000 --> 08:50.680
Where the hell would a ball -
would probably be in here?

08:52.120 --> 08:53.400
Erm...

08:56.600 --> 08:58.360
Oh.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.760
Hello. Hello.
SHE LAUGHS

09:00.800 --> 09:02.480
Do you have a ball with you? No.

09:02.520 --> 09:03.960
Why...why am I looking in here?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.160
This doesn't make any sense.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.720
Er, OK abort, abort. Abort!

09:12.680 --> 09:14.080
I don't need two, do I?

09:15.760 --> 09:17.960
Wait, wha...?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.600
I thought you couldn't...

09:20.640 --> 09:23.120
It says you can't hide!

09:23.160 --> 09:25.000
This is...this is a ball.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.120
All right, where's the Alex?

09:28.840 --> 09:30.640
But he can't hide.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.800
Not there, OK.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.520
Well, this is ridiculous.

09:34.560 --> 09:38.440
Are you watching all this on camera
and knowing where to go?

09:38.480 --> 09:41.040
Cos that is horrible.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.480
This is hiding!

09:44.000 --> 09:46.160
If I can't see you, it's hiding.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.680
Where have you hidden
this tall man?!

09:51.720 --> 09:53.640
There's...and there he goes.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.080
There, right.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.840
I'm not good at throwing.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.200
I'm so sorry!

10:05.320 --> 10:07.520
OK, where the hell haven't I looked?

10:08.920 --> 10:09.920
Oh, hello!

10:11.640 --> 10:14.240
Shouldn't run, but I saw you!

10:15.840 --> 10:18.400
Stop doing the thing
I know you're doing, man!

10:20.840 --> 10:23.920
No...no!
SHE LAUGHS

10:23.960 --> 10:26.960
Ah! I gotcha! Wha-ha-ha!

10:27.000 --> 10:28.440
What a blow.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.280
You're running, you're running.
I'm not allowed to run.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.600
There, there!

10:34.640 --> 10:36.080
SLOWED-DOWN: There!

10:37.400 --> 10:38.600
I've stopped the clock.

10:38.640 --> 10:42.080
That...is the most exercise I've
done since I was at school.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.080
APPLAUSE

10:47.120 --> 10:49.960
Desiree, there's a book
of Taskmaster quotes,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.680
and, er, "Stop doing the thing
I know you're doing"...

10:52.720 --> 10:54.360
LAUGHTER

10:54.400 --> 10:57.680
..is going immediately into it.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.680
Desiree spent the longest
looking for the ball.

10:59.720 --> 11:02.480
We didn't expect that to be...
part of the task.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.800
No.

11:03.840 --> 11:07.280
What I enjoyed, though, is your
natural anger towards Alex. Yes!

11:07.320 --> 11:12.080
And for you to feel rage this early
bodes very well for you.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.560
Now, it seems to me, Victoria,

11:14.600 --> 11:17.280
that you were baffled by
the rules of the game.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.960
And you sought to
impose your own rules.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.080
"If I can't see you, it's hiding."

11:23.360 --> 11:26.600
Is everyone you can't see
now hiding from you?

11:26.640 --> 11:28.600
LAUGHTER

11:28.640 --> 11:30.640
I thought that I'd found him.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.000
"OK, there he is, great.
Now I'll get the ball."

11:33.040 --> 11:35.600
And then, I came back, and he
wasn't there - that is hiding.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.320
I had moved, that's true.
How did they both do?

11:38.360 --> 11:41.080
Victoria was the slower of the two,
seven minutes, 24. Hm.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.720
But only 63 seconds quicker, over
here, six minutes and three seconds

11:44.760 --> 11:46.120
is in the lead at the moment.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.920
There we are. Six minutes
spent looking for the ball.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.000
Yeah, yeah.
LAUGHTER

11:51.040 --> 11:53.560
Lovely start. Right, we're
going to have a break now.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.640
Let's see if Alex can finally
buff my bottom well enough

11:56.680 --> 11:58.520
to see his crooked tooth in it!

11:58.560 --> 11:59.960
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

12:09.400 --> 12:13.640
Hello, and welcome back to the first
part two of the series.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.160
Before the break,
the new cast were partaking

12:16.200 --> 12:19.720
in one of my favourite pastimes
of hitting Alex with a ball.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.160
Yes, you're so good at it, big guy.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.280
We've learnt that Desiree
and Victoria

12:24.320 --> 12:26.400
prefer not to travel above walking
pace,

12:26.440 --> 12:29.280
but are Alan and Guz
more au fait with urgency?

12:29.320 --> 12:30.960
Let's find out.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.640
I think, uh, find a ball first.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.520
Oh, that's annoying cos I saw him
and he's gone, but he's not hiding.

12:57.560 --> 12:58.880
He's just moved.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.840
Alex?

13:00.880 --> 13:02.240
Alex!

13:10.440 --> 13:12.160
Alex! Yeah?

13:12.200 --> 13:13.920
Alex? Yeah?

13:13.960 --> 13:16.200
Alex? Yes?

13:16.240 --> 13:17.640
Alex!

13:23.240 --> 13:24.600
I've looked in all the bits.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.400
Alex? Hello? Alex?

13:31.560 --> 13:35.560
Alex! It's me! Hey!

13:35.600 --> 13:40.840
Maybe I'll just have a,
a snack, since I can't find him.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.000
Guz?

13:45.320 --> 13:46.440
Hello, Guz? Alex?

13:51.280 --> 13:52.680
Guz?

13:55.040 --> 13:58.800
Is there anywhere you can go?
Is there an upstairs?

13:58.840 --> 14:01.040
Alex? Yes?

14:01.080 --> 14:03.120
Are you in there?

14:08.400 --> 14:11.920
Alex? Alex!

14:14.880 --> 14:18.960
Ow! I was calling you for, like,
half an hour. I was calling you.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.440
There's pictures of Alex with a
ball.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.320
Oh, got me!

14:29.920 --> 14:31.520
APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER

14:33.560 --> 14:36.680
Two very different energies there,

14:36.720 --> 14:39.800
and I have to say that normally
when we do a series, it,

14:39.840 --> 14:40.880
it takes a few episodes

14:40.920 --> 14:46.600
for the tired middle-aged contestant
to make themselves known.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.240
So I'd like to thank Alan

14:50.280 --> 14:56.960
for plodding around the house
before stopping for a snack.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.000
Very different energy from Guz.

15:03.040 --> 15:06.160
It seemed to me that you wanted to,
uh, murder Alex.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.480
Yeah, I asked somebody as well,

15:07.520 --> 15:09.280
"Have you got any heavier balls
than this?"

15:09.320 --> 15:11.200
I really wanted to...
You did wanna hurt him.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.720
..some substantial damage, yeah.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.440
This is good, my boy. Thank you,
thank you.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.160
OK, so who did better,

15:16.200 --> 15:21.200
the, uh, psychopath who was in
pursuit of you, or my lovely uncle?

15:21.240 --> 15:23.800
Well, bearing in mind
we thought Victoria's time was slow,

15:23.840 --> 15:27.320
Alan was three minutes slower
than Victoria. Ten minutes 22.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.640
But Guz was also five seconds slower
than Victoria, so, uh,

15:30.680 --> 15:31.680
seven minutes 29.

15:31.720 --> 15:35.080
Uh, how am I suddenly
the benchmark for slowness?

15:36.280 --> 15:39.080
What we found is, I move quite fast.
That's what we've established.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.320
Nice. Who's left?
It's time for the Morgana show.

15:42.360 --> 15:45.040
Ready? Ready. Time starts now.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.000
Ball! Balls.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.600
Does anyone know, uh, are there any
balls anywhere?

15:52.640 --> 15:54.320
Well, I mean, I've got to find a
ball.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.600
Oh, I know where a ball is.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.000
I've just seen him, the little...
but I don't have a ball!

16:18.960 --> 16:20.920
Aah!

16:20.960 --> 16:22.560
Oh!

16:39.960 --> 16:41.200
Oh!

16:41.240 --> 16:42.640
APPLAUSE

16:46.200 --> 16:50.040
Now, now we're talking.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.680
Now we've got some spirit.
Bit of verve.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.640
Got quite a ducky run, though,
haven't I, which I wasn't aware of.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.600
A slightly ducky run. I thought
you looked like a primed athlete.

16:57.640 --> 17:01.160
Victoria, under her breath,
during it said, "So athletic".

17:01.200 --> 17:05.480
Yes, I thought it was great.
I love sitting next to Victoria.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.680
I barely give them out.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.320
I think there's been a handful
of occasions across 11 series.

17:09.360 --> 17:11.960
I'm going to give Morgana a bonus
point for her attempt. Wow.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.560
Before we even give her a score.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.880
Why are you giving, uh,
Morgana a bonus point?

17:16.920 --> 17:19.480
You would think it was because you
set a trap for Alex,

17:19.520 --> 17:21.040
which I really enjoyed and thought,

17:21.080 --> 17:23.520
"I'm gonna give her an extra point
for that, it's so clever."

17:23.560 --> 17:27.720
But it's not, it's cos you called
Alex a little... Ah.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.160
Amazing, so a bonus point. Yeah.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.160
Yes, you are setting quite
a precedent there

17:31.200 --> 17:32.800
for the future. Yeah. Don't care.

17:32.840 --> 17:36.480
And I've probably said quite a
few in the show, actually.

17:36.520 --> 17:39.600
Yeah, well,
let's watch those points rack up.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.720
No, listen, I can't fault it.
It was a spirited attempt.

17:42.760 --> 17:43.960
Was it a good time, though?

17:44.000 --> 17:47.960
It was five times faster than Uncle
Alan, two minutes and four seconds.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.040
Oh, Uncle Alan.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.440
Impressive... Impressive.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.640
So tell me some stuff.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.760
Yes, well, Alan only gets one point.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.800
Then it was Guz, then Victoria,

17:57.840 --> 18:02.400
then Desiree. Morgana, I mean, this
is unprecedented, gets six points.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.120
I don't have a six function on this,
but five plus one.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.880
So Morgana wins the task.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.960
Go on, then, let's have a
scoreboard.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.040
OK, well, Guz and Alan are at the
bottom

18:14.080 --> 18:16.960
and Desiree's at the top
with nine points.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.840
Well done, Desiree, well done.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.120
What's next?

18:21.160 --> 18:24.480
It's a creeping task
for our creepy cast.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.360
Hello. Welcome, Alan.

18:43.400 --> 18:47.840
This is a creeper.
Please could you lie down on it?

18:47.880 --> 18:50.000
Now? Yes.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.960
Oh, I don't feel like I've got full
range of movement in this outfit.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.480
No. Belly, you want me to go belly
first? No. Back first?

18:56.520 --> 18:59.440
Yes, please. Oh. All right.
It's called a car creeper.

18:59.480 --> 19:03.440
Is this how you get underneath
cars to fix them? Yes, it is.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.320
Little head that rests on the little
black pillow. Comfortable?

19:06.360 --> 19:10.800
I mean, I've been more comfortable.
Here it comes.

19:10.840 --> 19:16.640
"Paint the most flattering picture
of the Taskmaster in action."

19:16.680 --> 19:19.160
"On the canvas in the lab."

19:19.200 --> 19:20.200
SHE LAUGHS

19:20.240 --> 19:22.680
OK!

19:22.720 --> 19:25.720
"The canvas will either be six
inches or six feet above you."

19:27.480 --> 19:32.880
"You must lie flat on your back
on the creeper at all times.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.080
"You have ten minutes."

19:35.120 --> 19:36.960
"Your time starts now
and you must tell Alex

19:37.000 --> 19:40.200
"if you want the canvas to
be six inches...

19:40.240 --> 19:44.080
"Or six feet above you within
the next ten seconds." Hmm.

19:44.120 --> 19:48.600
I think I want it six, uh, dammit.
Uh...

19:48.640 --> 19:53.200
But if it's six feet, uh,
how would I reach it?

19:53.240 --> 19:55.280
Good question. With a very long
paintbrush?

19:55.320 --> 19:57.520
Six inches! Six inches.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.880
I think, uh, I think
I'll go six feet.

20:00.920 --> 20:04.520
Six feet? Yeah. Up we go.
All right, then, Alan.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.800
Six inches. I'll go six feet.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.880
Good luck. Thank you.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.920
You must stay lying down, though.
Oh.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.720
Hmm, right. Yes, yes. Good.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.280
Now, I'm not gonna make a feature
of this throughout the series

20:18.320 --> 20:19.960
because it would become very
tiresome,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.040
but I will point out that everybody
agonised

20:22.080 --> 20:25.760
over the height of the canvas above
their heads apart from Alan, who,

20:25.800 --> 20:27.720
when he said, "I think I'll go six
feet",

20:27.760 --> 20:31.400
may as well have said, "What does
it matter? I'll be dead soon."

20:32.760 --> 20:35.160
I found Guz Khan absolutely
adorable

20:35.200 --> 20:37.600
for one beat during that
introduction.

20:37.640 --> 20:42.000
He became a ten-year-old boy
and I wanted to hold him.

20:42.040 --> 20:45.200
Yes, I can... I think I've got the
beat here. Here it is.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.680
Back first. Yes, please. Oh.

20:50.760 --> 20:53.760
Yes! Cute little thing.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.440
Right, we're going to leave this
task hanging

20:56.480 --> 20:58.000
like the very worst smell

20:58.040 --> 21:00.400
because it's time for us to go to
the adverts,

21:00.440 --> 21:04.040
or as Alex calls them,
the tiny films.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.520
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

21:15.560 --> 21:18.840
Hello! Welcome back to Taskmaster.

21:18.880 --> 21:19.880
Before the break,

21:19.920 --> 21:22.640
the cast were manoeuvring themselves
about on a car creeper.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.200
We've seen the decisions they made.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.520
There's the six-footers,
Alan and Victoria,

21:26.560 --> 21:28.960
and the six-inchers,
Morgana, Desiree, and Guz.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.360
Here's how all of them got on.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.680
SHE LAUGHS

21:32.720 --> 21:34.880
I don't really know
where the lab is.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.360
Where am I going?

21:39.720 --> 21:41.280
DESIREE: Oh, er...

21:41.320 --> 21:42.560
OK.

21:42.600 --> 21:43.880
GUZ: Take these with me.

21:45.560 --> 21:49.000
ALAN: This is the most bizarre
and unnerving experience.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.920
Am in the lab yet?

21:50.960 --> 21:52.360
Whoa.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.400
OK, sorry.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.000
Oh, I feel like I'm in an MRI.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.000
What, this is way closer.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.040
This is six inches?

21:58.080 --> 22:01.200
Guys always think this is
six inches. This is five.

22:01.240 --> 22:05.040
I'll tell you what, six feet is
further than I thought it would be.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.440
What can I do it with?

22:06.480 --> 22:08.720
I've provided with you with
some paints, and...

22:08.760 --> 22:10.520
Wh-Where? Have I gone past them?

22:10.560 --> 22:11.920
Is this a joke?

22:14.120 --> 22:15.840
Oh, BLEEP.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.680
This is kind of the position I like
to be in, brother, when I'm at work,

22:18.720 --> 22:20.040
you know what I mean?

22:20.080 --> 22:21.520
This is not art.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.800
This is a nightmare.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.120
Where? Oh, I see.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.840
Honestly...oh, my God!

22:27.880 --> 22:29.840
Oh, look at all this BLEEP! OK.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.640
MORGANA: Ah! Oh, lovely OK.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.720
Have you got any brushes on poles?

22:35.760 --> 22:38.240
Paintbrushes, where were they?

22:38.280 --> 22:42.920
Yeah, I feel like this is
the first task, bro, where, er...

22:42.960 --> 22:45.320
..I really feel zen-like, you know?

22:45.360 --> 22:49.840
What you've done is reduce
the ability for me to cause chaos,

22:49.880 --> 22:51.000
do you know what I mean?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.800
VICTORIA: What are these?
Big pencils?

22:56.840 --> 22:58.440
It's just a stick!

22:58.480 --> 23:00.520
Oh...

23:00.560 --> 23:02.520
I'm exhausted.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.160
Haven't seen any brushes?

23:04.200 --> 23:05.680
Guys, is this a wind...

23:05.720 --> 23:07.120
Oh, little BLEEP!

23:09.240 --> 23:12.600
GUZ: I genuinely wouldn't mind
if you extended this task

23:12.640 --> 23:14.080
to three-and-a-half hours.

23:14.120 --> 23:17.000
DESIREE: Let's get some
features on this blob.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.600
I think this is just appalling,
the way this has been organised,

23:19.640 --> 23:21.040
to be honest with you.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.440
I'm just going to
concentrate on eyebrows.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.680
It's a gold throne, isn't it,
that he sits on?

23:27.720 --> 23:29.800
Oh, I've got no BLEEP gold.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.440
You've got six-and-a-half minutes.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

23:33.040 --> 23:35.200
There wasn't a time thing
on the actual thing.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.560
There was.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.120
I wish I'd done the six inches.
HE LAUGHS

23:41.880 --> 23:43.640
Anyone can paint from six feet.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.600
Oh, this is too long.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.680
This is not how painting
should be done.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.600
I think I've strained
every muscle in my body.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.720
GUZ: Don't have to rush.
Still got some time.

23:52.760 --> 23:55.560
If there's some kind of
bowel movements from me,

23:55.600 --> 23:57.320
it's a natural part of life, innit?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.280
20 seconds, Alan. Oh, come on!

24:00.320 --> 24:02.240
20 seconds to give a man a soul?

24:02.280 --> 24:03.680
Do you what I think is the problem?

24:03.720 --> 24:05.600
It's the paint brush.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.720
This is not uplifting for people!

24:09.280 --> 24:10.640
SHE LAUGHS
This is awful.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.200
WHISTLE BLOWS

24:13.680 --> 24:15.360
APPLAUSE

24:15.400 --> 24:17.960
Guz, did you expect,
for the first time in your life,

24:18.000 --> 24:21.120
to find inner peace whilst
trapped under a canvas?

24:21.160 --> 24:22.400
Listen, absolutely not.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.560
You learn something new
about yourself every day.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.560
But it was a very nice break

24:26.600 --> 24:29.200
from running around like
a BLEEP all day.

24:29.240 --> 24:31.720
I just want to say, though,
I was covered in paint.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.160
And I had to go two-and-a-half
hours back to Cov,

24:34.200 --> 24:36.400
and the brother that was
driving me back said,

24:36.440 --> 24:39.280
IN ACCENT: "I don't want you have
any paint on my car, so sit."

24:39.320 --> 24:40.320
LAUGHTER

24:40.360 --> 24:42.800
So, the whole zen-like thing
didn't last that long? No.

24:42.840 --> 24:45.600
It was well, sort of,
Sistine Chapel vibes, weren't it?

24:45.640 --> 24:48.560
I just imagine, you know, like...
Yeah, it's very Michelangelo. Yeah.

24:48.600 --> 24:52.880
Unlike Desiree who, er,
shouted, "Whoa! Bleep!"

24:52.920 --> 24:54.840
LAUGHTER

24:54.880 --> 24:57.440
That right.
When she got to her canvas.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.360
And there's a feeling to you,
Morgana - I feel, watching you,

25:00.400 --> 25:03.960
that at any minute, you could just
smash everything up and run away.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.720
But it was very contained.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.040
I was composed.

25:07.080 --> 25:10.880
I don't think that Victoria knew
what show she was signing up to.

25:10.920 --> 25:13.880
ALL LAUGH

25:13.920 --> 25:15.480
Alan, you'll be pleased to know

25:15.520 --> 25:19.600
you've made it into the Taskmaster
heritage book of quotes with,

25:19.640 --> 25:22.640
"Oh, come on, 20 seconds
to give a man a soul."

25:22.680 --> 25:24.760
LAUGHTER

25:24.800 --> 25:26.880
And I can't wait to see my soul.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.800
Well, I thought it'd be nice
to see the six-inchers first,

25:29.840 --> 25:32.040
so we can compare and contrast.
Five. Five!

25:32.080 --> 25:33.400
A gentleman's six.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.120
LAUGHTER

25:35.160 --> 25:37.920
Well, Desiree tried to get
some "faces on the blob",

25:37.960 --> 25:41.400
that was her quote.
And this is what she did. Yeah.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.240
I love that. That looks really good.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.400
Very expressive!
There's a lot of action in that.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.640
You were also emerging from the sea.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.880
Is it a reflection of him
at the top?

25:49.920 --> 25:52.960
There was a, sort of, a myth
of Narcissus thing going on,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.480
with your reflection rippling in the
water that you had just destroyed

25:56.520 --> 25:58.680
because you were in action.
Ooh! Right.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.400
Just really BLEEP that one.
Did that come out all right? Yeah.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.320
Great. We've got Guz next.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.960
Yes, Guz. He did that.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.920
LAUGHTER

26:06.960 --> 26:08.400
I think it's very excellent.

26:08.440 --> 26:11.080
LAUGHTER CONTINUES

26:11.120 --> 26:12.480
What about the hand prints?

26:12.520 --> 26:14.880
Kind of like a signat...
what do you call it? A signature.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.080
A signature, yeah. Yeah.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.680
He's got your bags, hasn't he,
Greg, under the eyes?

26:18.720 --> 26:20.080
Yeah, yeah. I noticed them.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.520
I was giving him the benefit
of the doubt. Right.

26:22.560 --> 26:25.960
The last six-incher is Morgana.
Here we go. All right.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.640
Oh, that looks like a majestic deer.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.880
You're playing football, by the way.
Oh, am I?

26:30.920 --> 26:33.520
Yeah, that's a ball and a net
on the left there.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.880
You've just scored a goal.

26:34.920 --> 26:38.480
But you're still a little bit
pissed off, so hence the eyebrows.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.680
Oh, they're eyebrows.
Couple of quotes from Morgana.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.120
"He's basically all eyebrows."

26:42.160 --> 26:44.600
"He's got a pointy nose."
"He's nostrilly and angry."

26:44.640 --> 26:46.840
He's "basically all eyebrows"?
Basically.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.200
Thanks, Alex, thanks.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.480
Who's next? Well, Alan said
you've got a dark soul,

26:50.520 --> 26:52.880
you're red in the face,
and you're piggy-eyed...

26:52.920 --> 26:54.720
LAUGHTER ..and he did this picture.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.360
LAUGHTER CONTINUES

26:56.400 --> 26:57.880
Ooh! I like it.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.480
Up to the last second,
you didn't have any eyes at all,

27:00.520 --> 27:02.960
and then, it really looked
terrifying. Yeah.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.320
But I really have given you
a soul there and now,

27:05.360 --> 27:07.000
who wouldn't want that man?

27:07.040 --> 27:09.840
He was making the "rage of
Taskmaster". That was his title.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.720
Well, the rage of Taskmaster
comes through. I like the face.

27:12.760 --> 27:13.920
OK, well, there's one left.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.880
It's sort of the minimal approach,
this is Victoria's painting.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.200
Oh, here we go.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.800
LAUGHTER

27:20.840 --> 27:22.880
Oh, come on, Victoria.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.320
You've got to dig deep.
We're here for ten weeks.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.360
LAUGHTER CONTINUES

27:28.400 --> 27:32.320
I don't know if my self-esteem
is going to survive this series.

27:32.360 --> 27:36.000
I...Desiree did
the myth of Narcissus.

27:36.040 --> 27:38.520
LAUGHTER

27:38.560 --> 27:40.960
I couldn't do a face!

27:41.000 --> 27:44.440
That would be more like me
if you'd just fallen into it.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.720
OK well, here are all five for you,
Greg.

27:48.760 --> 27:52.240
Unfortunately... Yeah?
..even though I'm worried about her,

27:52.280 --> 27:54.080
I'm going to give Victoria
one point.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.680
One point, well done, Victoria.
I know. I'm grateful for that.

27:56.720 --> 27:59.920
I'm going to give Morgana
two points, and it's basically

27:59.960 --> 28:02.720
because Desiree really BLEEP
her way to three points.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.160
Yes!

28:04.200 --> 28:06.560
So, it's between Guz and Alan,
then, for the five points.

28:06.600 --> 28:09.240
Yeah, and that is tough, because...

28:09.280 --> 28:13.240
..Alan really did check in
with my soul. Yeah.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.200
But I guess Guz just knows me.

28:15.240 --> 28:16.480
LAUGHTER

28:16.520 --> 28:18.560
Five points to Guz Khan. Correct.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.360
Congratulations, Guz!

28:20.400 --> 28:23.240
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

28:23.280 --> 28:25.960
I think we should have another task,
you messy little boy.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.480
I think we should, too,
and this one involves me

28:28.520 --> 28:30.520
running my very own shop.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.120
Ooh!

28:46.480 --> 28:47.840
"Pop the balloon."

28:47.880 --> 28:49.080
What balloon?

28:53.440 --> 28:54.600
Ah.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.320
MORGANA: "You must stay behind
the rope at all times."

28:59.360 --> 29:01.680
This...ah, this rope here.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.120
"You must not move the rope.

29:03.160 --> 29:06.200
"You may buy the tools
you need with time."

29:06.240 --> 29:07.400
That's Shakespearian.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.440
"You may buy the tools
you need with time."

29:09.480 --> 29:11.040
It is Shakespeare you're right.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.920
"Fastest wins."

29:12.960 --> 29:17.520
My time starts when Alex
"has shown me his tool shop."

29:17.560 --> 29:19.120
Awesome, OK.

29:19.160 --> 29:20.560
Hello, Alan. Hello.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.360
This is my tool shop. Nice.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.600
I can offer you a slingshot and a
bucket of stones for one minute.

29:25.640 --> 29:29.560
OK. The pebbles cost you
one minute, 30 per pebble.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.880
SHE LAUGHS

29:31.920 --> 29:34.720
You OK? Yes! OK.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.200
I just...
I'm getting the concept, yeah, OK.

29:37.240 --> 29:40.960
Two minutes per fork,
or the darts are two minutes, 30...

29:41.000 --> 29:42.760
Two minutes, 30, of course.
..per dart.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.840
The rubber ducks are free, Alan.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.720
We've also got these nice
portcullis scissors,

29:47.760 --> 29:49.440
and that costs you eight minutes.

29:49.480 --> 29:53.160
And, with them, you snip the string
behind you and see what happens.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.760
But that's the only time you're
allowed to touch the string.

29:55.800 --> 29:58.720
But this will take eight minutes
off the time? Eight minutes, yes.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.600
Then, brother, this is not sensible.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.520
THEY LAUGH

30:03.560 --> 30:04.840
Alex, yes.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.960
I'm very excited to see your
pop shop in action.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.240
I really loved this one.

30:08.280 --> 30:11.440
We're going to start with
Mor-Guz-Khan-a.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.560
Morgana and Guz.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.960
Hello, sir, what would you like?

30:15.000 --> 30:17.760
OK...can I have some darts, please?

30:17.800 --> 30:20.600
I'm just going to have some darts,
please. How many would you like?

30:20.640 --> 30:22.040
Can I have two? Two darts.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.160
So, that will cost you five minutes.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.600
One dart is two minutes
and 30 seconds?

30:26.640 --> 30:28.040
Would you like one dart?

30:28.080 --> 30:29.520
This is a rip-off, this shop!

30:31.480 --> 30:34.040
That was...
oh, it's gone in the concrete.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.320
It's trashed concrete.
Are we going to get it repaired?

30:36.360 --> 30:37.920
Yeah, I'll have that repaired.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.680
Can I try one more dart? Yes.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.160
Oh!

30:45.200 --> 30:46.640
Oh, hello. I'll take the lot.

30:51.040 --> 30:52.680
Oh, so close.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.160
You know what I'm going to do?

30:56.200 --> 30:57.920
I'm going to have another...dart.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.600
Can you explain to me
how the slingshot works?

31:03.640 --> 31:07.600
If you're using the slingshot,
we both have to wear goggles.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.760
Can I touch one of those ducks?

31:09.800 --> 31:12.320
The ducks are free.
The ducks are free?

31:12.360 --> 31:14.120
What sort of shop is this?

31:15.520 --> 31:17.440
SHE GIGGLES
That's quite aggressive.

31:17.480 --> 31:18.680
Welcome back.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.280
AUDIENCE OOHS

31:23.480 --> 31:25.480
That deserved to pop!

31:25.520 --> 31:28.680
There is a imbalance in
the poppability of the balloon.

31:35.480 --> 31:36.880
You're good at that.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.480
Can I have a refund? No.

31:38.520 --> 31:40.440
That'll be seven minutes, 30,
please.

31:43.040 --> 31:46.240
I'll have a duck. Ducks are free.
Oh, here's a duck.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.200
SHE EXHALES

31:48.240 --> 31:49.920
Ooh, missed by a bee's BLEEP!

31:49.960 --> 31:51.520
Pardon?

31:51.560 --> 31:53.880
Hm. You're already doubting me
with that tone.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.720
You don't even have to say a word.
OK.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.440
Feels like being at school again.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.320
BLEEP!

32:11.480 --> 32:14.040
Can I have the scissors, please?

32:14.080 --> 32:15.400
That'll be eight minutes.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.000
I've stopped the clock.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.920
Brother, there's a word -
I've never used it before in life.

32:26.960 --> 32:28.280
It's called hindsight.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.080
Why have you never used
the word "hindsight" before?

32:34.120 --> 32:35.280
Just not in my...

32:35.320 --> 32:37.760
It's amazing that you're asking him
to look back on that.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.000
ALAN: Yeah, look back on that!

32:39.040 --> 32:40.840
It's beautiful. Irony, mate.

32:40.880 --> 32:43.280
Shall I tell you some times, Greg?
Oh, here we go.

32:43.320 --> 32:46.760
Guz, eight minutes without
the time penalties.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.840
It was a total of 36 minutes, 58.

32:48.880 --> 32:51.160
You could've listened to
the theme tune to the

32:51.200 --> 32:53.240
Last of the Summer Wine 53 times.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.360
Morgana, 84 Last of the Summer Wine
theme tunes. Oh.

32:56.400 --> 32:59.160
That's 56 minutes altogether,
cos there were 13 darts,

32:59.200 --> 33:02.720
four pebbles, scissors,
and actual time, as well.

33:02.760 --> 33:06.000
Lovely. Would you like to see
Queen Victoria II all by herself?

33:06.040 --> 33:07.960
Yes, please! Here she is.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.800
Er, I'll have a dart, please.

33:09.840 --> 33:12.640
OK, a dart will cost you
two minutes, 30.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.120
Thank you, madam. Thank you.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.440
I'll have another dart, please.

33:21.480 --> 33:26.320
Welcome back. Yeah, that'll
cost you two minutes 30.

33:26.360 --> 33:27.840
Oh! Hello.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.400
How can I help you?
I'll have a dart, please. A dart.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.960
You...
SHE SHOUTS GIBBERISH

33:35.000 --> 33:37.720
Hello, again. Go on, give me a duck.
I just want to...just a duck.

33:37.760 --> 33:38.880
The ducks are free.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.400
I mean, this is...
why would it do it?

33:40.440 --> 33:41.680
but I can't even hit the thing.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.560
Duck, duck, duck,
I'll have three ducks, please.

33:43.600 --> 33:46.320
'Course. Any particular ducks?
I don't mind. A duck.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.560
I'm using the ducks
to practise aiming.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.120
OK, I'll have a dart, please.
Hello, there, a dart.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.600
That'll cost you two minutes, 30.
Lovely.

33:53.640 --> 33:54.640
Oh!

33:56.400 --> 33:58.640
I've already used more
than eight minutes, haven't I?

33:58.680 --> 34:00.960
Quite a lot more. I think
the move might be to just take

34:01.000 --> 34:02.400
the scissors in the first place.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.800
Ah! OK.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.240
Oh!

34:07.280 --> 34:10.120
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

34:13.960 --> 34:16.120
So, I've stopped the clock.
That's so satisfying!

34:16.160 --> 34:17.440
That was so worth it!

34:17.480 --> 34:20.360
I don't care if it'd taken
three days, that was so worth it.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.840
Nh! Splah! Tsh!

34:22.880 --> 34:23.880
Ah!

34:23.920 --> 34:25.360
APPLAUSE

34:25.400 --> 34:27.000
That was really good.
That was proper.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.640
That was very impressive. Thank you.
Lovely. Now we're cooking.

34:29.680 --> 34:31.680
You enjoyed that one, right?
I did enjoy it.

34:31.720 --> 34:35.120
You didn't bank on Victoria using
ducks to practise her aim, did you?

34:35.160 --> 34:37.360
I did not.
It was a nine-dart finish.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.560
25 minutes, 30 was her total time.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.200
Which puts Victoria in the lead.
By miles!

34:42.240 --> 34:43.560
GREG WHISTLES
By miles.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.000
Oh, well, that's nice.

34:45.040 --> 34:47.920
OK, you want adverts?
You've got them. Don't go anywhere.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.360
Even if you need the toilet.
I want to see commitment.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.720
It'll come out with hot water
and elbow grease.

34:52.760 --> 34:53.920
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

35:01.480 --> 35:02.920
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

35:02.960 --> 35:05.520
Hello, welcome back to
the final part of the show.

35:05.560 --> 35:08.880
Weren't people trying to pop
a balloon before the break, Alex?

35:08.920 --> 35:11.760
Yes, my side project is
a pop-up pop shop.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.920
I sell all sorts of things
which might be useful

35:13.960 --> 35:15.240
for popping balloons.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.400
And the currency I deal in is time.

35:17.440 --> 35:20.240
Two of our five resorted to the
portcullis releasing scissors.

35:20.280 --> 35:21.840
One succeeded with a dart.

35:21.880 --> 35:25.440
Last up, it's Alan D and Dessy B!

35:25.480 --> 35:26.840
Yeah.

35:26.880 --> 35:28.280
Oh, I'm going to, I...

35:28.320 --> 35:31.000
I'm not confident I can hit that
with a dart first time.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.880
There is a slingshot.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.920
I would love to purchase one.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.880
Right. That'll cost you one minute.

35:36.920 --> 35:40.160
I'm quite tempted by the scissors,
and that'll make it drop on it.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.040
Yeah, I think that's the
one I want to do.

35:42.080 --> 35:43.520
You'd like some scissors? Yeah.

35:43.560 --> 35:46.560
OK, this'll cost you eight minutes.
OK, thanks. There we go.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.480
Down...

35:51.760 --> 35:53.080
Oh, eat it.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.680
OK, you know what?

35:54.720 --> 35:57.840
Erm..I'm going to go ahead
and buy some scissors.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.720
Oh, you're going to
buy the scissors.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.960
SHE GROANS

36:02.000 --> 36:04.200
Oh, OK, you know what? Erm...

36:04.240 --> 36:06.920
You know what? I think
I'm going to come for some ducks.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.280
Oh, right.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.480
Hi, there. How can I help you?

36:13.520 --> 36:15.560
I would like to purchase
those three darts.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.480
Three darts? Yeah.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.000
No.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.240
God, no!

36:23.440 --> 36:24.720
Ding dong, hi.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.160
Let's go ahead and buy three forks.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.320
Why not? Six minutes.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.440
SHE LAUGHS

36:31.280 --> 36:32.560
No! Hello, there.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.680
I think I'd like to get
another slingshot.

36:34.720 --> 36:35.920
Another slingshot, OK.

36:37.080 --> 36:39.040
What is wrong with your rocks?!

36:42.120 --> 36:44.040
You keep hitting it with the stones.

36:44.080 --> 36:46.480
Now this is getting ridiculous.
Yeah.

36:46.520 --> 36:47.880
Ding dong! Oh, hello, madam.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.680
I would love to get
another set of darts.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.320
No. Maybe.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.200
Definitely not.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.520
Hi, there. Ding dong.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.120
One fork and six ducks.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.040
Argh!

37:03.160 --> 37:05.600
Ding dong. I think I would love
to get some forks.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.480
Well, I've got a bucket
of forks here.

37:07.520 --> 37:08.640
How much is the bucket?

37:08.680 --> 37:09.880
That'll cost you an hour.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.360
It's an hour well spent. OK.
Sir, you've got yourself a deal.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.520
Enjoy your forks.
Thank you so much.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.120
Ooh. Ooh!

37:21.160 --> 37:22.960
I don't even know
how to throw forks!

37:24.160 --> 37:25.160
Yeah!

37:26.440 --> 37:27.800
SLOWED-DOWN: Yeah!

37:33.520 --> 37:34.960
SHE SCREAMS

37:41.560 --> 37:42.960
Hello, madam.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.320
DEFLATED: Ding dong, sir.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.760
How can I help you?

37:45.800 --> 37:47.480
You know what?
Can I get some scissors?

37:47.520 --> 37:49.360
Some scissors.
Yes, we've got one pair left.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.640
They cost eight minutes.

37:50.680 --> 37:53.360
In your own time, Alan. OK.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.720
Righto.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.480
I've stopped the clock.
That was very enjoyable.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.600
LAUGHTER

38:10.640 --> 38:13.920
Well, that would've been great
if I could've aimed the scissors.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.400
Are you kidding me?!

38:15.440 --> 38:17.760
APPLAUSE What was that?!

38:17.800 --> 38:19.360
I've stopped the clock.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.560
Does the clock still have
time inside of it?

38:21.600 --> 38:23.640
It's nearly run out.
Thank you, Desiree.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.000
Thank you.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

38:28.600 --> 38:30.240
Wow. Come on.

38:30.280 --> 38:33.000
DESIREE LAUGHS

38:33.040 --> 38:35.720
Right, well, before we get
to the main course,

38:35.760 --> 38:37.480
let's deal with the starter, er...

38:37.520 --> 38:38.880
What happened there, Alan?

38:38.920 --> 38:40.720
Have a snack
you wanted to go and eat?

38:40.760 --> 38:43.040
There's no way I'm going to hit
that balloon from here.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.280
That's what I thought.
Very efficient. Eight minutes.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.960
A minute thinking, so a minute plus
eight - nine minutes for Alan.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.160
Good. So, he is the winner of
the task, five points.

38:50.200 --> 38:52.240
Well done, Alan. Now...

38:52.280 --> 38:55.840
OK, look. For the record,
when I got out there,

38:55.880 --> 38:59.760
my head went, "Get the scissors,
it's worth the time."

38:59.800 --> 39:03.320
But I was like, "That is not
the game, that is not the show."

39:03.360 --> 39:05.680
That's boring, and I was like...
That's what I thought.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.280
Like Alan did? Yeah!
If I just win it, that's boring.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.520
LAUGHTER

39:09.560 --> 39:11.760
Well, whatever that attempt was,
it wasn't boring.

39:11.800 --> 39:15.600
And it looked like we'd set up
that portcullis not to work,

39:15.640 --> 39:17.360
but it was genuine, wasn't it?

39:17.400 --> 39:19.520
The portcullis was meant to work,
but it had lost...

39:19.560 --> 39:21.400
The will to live.
LAUGHTER

39:21.440 --> 39:23.920
That's a fair point!
And listen, I'm going to call it -

39:23.960 --> 39:27.240
in 12 series, that's the worst
attempt we've ever seen at any task.

39:27.280 --> 39:30.320
Thank you!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

39:32.000 --> 39:34.880
The time? It's an entire series
of Last of the Summer Wine,

39:34.920 --> 39:36.800
two hours, 57 minutes. Wow.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.360
So, Desiree gets just the one point.

39:38.400 --> 39:43.480
Morgana, 2, Guz, 3, Victoria, 4,
and Alan Davies, 5 points!

39:43.520 --> 39:46.320
There you go.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

39:46.360 --> 39:49.440
It's not always about being
entertaining, is it?

39:49.480 --> 39:51.920
LAUGHTER

39:51.960 --> 39:53.520
Quick look at the scores, then?

39:53.560 --> 39:55.000
Yes, it's a close one.

39:55.040 --> 39:57.240
All five of them could win
with one task to go,

39:57.280 --> 39:59.400
but Alan is in the lead at
the moment with 14 points!

39:59.440 --> 40:01.600
Wow.
APPLAUSE

40:01.640 --> 40:02.640
Here we go.

40:02.680 --> 40:05.600
All right, then everyone,
please make your way to the stage

40:05.640 --> 40:07.400
for the final task of the show!

40:12.240 --> 40:14.800
Hello. Hello, Greg.
Hello, everyone.

40:14.840 --> 40:18.320
Who will you be choosing to read out
the task, young fellow my lad?

40:18.360 --> 40:19.680
Victoria.

40:21.520 --> 40:25.520
"Write down a cool hobby,
a fun animal, and a famous person.

40:25.560 --> 40:26.760
"You have 30 seconds."

40:26.800 --> 40:28.440
And those 30 seconds start...

40:28.480 --> 40:29.840
WHISTLE BLOWS

40:29.880 --> 40:32.920
I'll repeat them,
for anyone struggling.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.880
It's a cool hobby. Ooh.

40:34.920 --> 40:36.720
It's a fun animal. Lovely.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.800
And it's a famous person.

40:38.840 --> 40:40.720
WHISTLE BLOWS
Thanks, guys.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.960
How you getting on with
the picking up? Not great.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.800
I hurt my back a little bit. Ohh.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.280
My God.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.840
THEY LAUGH

40:48.880 --> 40:50.120
Greg, I've got news.

40:50.160 --> 40:51.600
There's a second part to the task.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.800
Oh, what, you trickster! Oh.

40:53.840 --> 40:58.120
"Strike a pose to represent first,
your cool hobby,

40:58.160 --> 40:59.760
"then your fun animal,

40:59.800 --> 41:01.320
"then your famous person.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.400
"You will have ten seconds
to strike a pose.

41:03.440 --> 41:06.600
"and must then hold the pose
until the end of the round.

41:06.640 --> 41:10.680
"The Taskmaster will attempt
to guess what each pose represents.

41:10.720 --> 41:14.480
"You may not make a noise
or movement when posed."

41:14.520 --> 41:19.240
And, just so you know,
I am notoriously bad at these games.

41:19.280 --> 41:22.720
Please strike a pose to represent
your cool hobby.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.000
BLOWS WHISTLE

41:24.040 --> 41:25.520
GUZ: God.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.280
Oh, my God.
BLOWS WHISTLE

41:27.320 --> 41:29.080
OK, what do you think Alan's doing?

41:29.120 --> 41:33.640
I think Alan is...making...a model.

41:33.680 --> 41:34.880
I can't give you that.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.440
He's doing surf-gami.

41:36.480 --> 41:37.960
It's surfing with origami!

41:38.000 --> 41:39.240
Surf-gami. OK.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.720
No points for Alan so far.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.400
What do you think Desiree is doing?

41:42.440 --> 41:46.360
I think Desiree is in
a cool bowling alley.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.440
Yes!

41:47.480 --> 41:49.400
MORGANA: Yeah, baby! Correct.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.480
VICTORIA: Yay.

41:50.520 --> 41:54.360
What cool hobby is Guz Khan
pretending to do? Oh...

41:54.400 --> 41:57.560
I was going to say trampolining, and
that's a mid-air trampolining pose.

41:57.600 --> 41:58.680
Ooh. It's not right.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.800
It's a bobsleigh ting.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.280
Oh, 'course it's a bobsleigh ting.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.120
OK, it's Morgana's turn now.

42:04.160 --> 42:06.360
She is currently representing
a cool hobby.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.600
Table tennis? Correct!

42:07.640 --> 42:09.160
Nice. Wow.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.360
Finally, Victoria Coren-Mitchell.

42:11.400 --> 42:13.480
OK, I think she's on the wall
of death on a motorbike.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.760
No, I don't.
LAUGHTER

42:15.800 --> 42:17.320
She's kayaking.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.840
She's doing ice sculpture, Greg.

42:19.880 --> 42:22.920
Oh, of course it was ice sculpture!
It's a cool joke. "Cool."

42:22.960 --> 42:25.160
Cool. It was a literal cool thing.

42:25.200 --> 42:28.760
OK. Please pose as your fun animal.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.440
You have ten seconds. Animal!

42:30.480 --> 42:31.800
Starting...

42:31.840 --> 42:33.240
WHISTLE BLOWS

42:37.040 --> 42:38.320
GREG LAUGHS

42:38.360 --> 42:39.360
WHISTLE BLOWS

42:39.400 --> 42:41.880
Alan is one funky orangutan.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.240
Well, unfortunately not.

42:43.280 --> 42:44.640
He's gone for a zebr-onkey.

42:44.680 --> 42:47.960
Oh! A zebr-onkey is a cross between
a monkey and zebra, or a donkey?

42:48.000 --> 42:52.240
It's half zebra, half monkey.
OK, we move on to Desiree Burch.

42:52.280 --> 42:54.800
It just might be
a really fun rabbit.

42:54.840 --> 42:57.480
Ooh! It's the rabbit's cousin,
the hamster.

42:57.520 --> 43:00.840
That famous hamster pose.
DESIREE LAUGHS

43:00.880 --> 43:03.400
Now, then.
Guz has used his clothing.

43:03.440 --> 43:04.760
What animal is that?

43:04.800 --> 43:07.240
I think that is a
duck-billed platypus.

43:07.280 --> 43:10.160
It's an aardvark. Ohh.

43:10.200 --> 43:13.800
The beak of the aardvark
quacking away there.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.280
What animal, is she?
She's a fun...puppy?

43:16.320 --> 43:18.360
But I'd like to know
what breed you think she is?

43:18.400 --> 43:20.200
Oh, she's a fun little Labrador.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.000
Oh! She's a sausage puppy.

43:22.040 --> 43:24.640
Oh, yeah... Look how long I am!
Yeah, you're long, you are long.

43:24.680 --> 43:26.960
Is it half a point for puppy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.600
So, what do you think Victoria
Coren-Mitchell is representing?

43:29.640 --> 43:32.120
It's gotta be a lovely, fun cat.
It's more fun than a cat.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.560
It's an otter.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.480
Oh, they are fun, as well.

43:35.520 --> 43:36.960
So fun! Ohh...

43:37.000 --> 43:39.520
You've got ten seconds to pose
as your famous person. OK.

43:39.560 --> 43:41.360
WHISTLE BLOWS

43:41.400 --> 43:43.200
LAUGHTER

43:43.240 --> 43:46.080
WHISTLE BLOWS
OK, so they've all posed.

43:46.120 --> 43:47.440
Good luck with this, Greg.

43:47.480 --> 43:49.080
Well, he's an artist of some kind.

43:49.120 --> 43:51.160
Which one? He's Salvador Dali.

43:51.200 --> 43:54.240
He's Tony Hart, and...
Of course he's Tony Hart!

43:54.280 --> 43:56.800
All right, move on to Desiree Burch.

43:56.840 --> 43:59.160
It's a film star.

43:59.200 --> 44:02.160
Which film star?
It's Macaulay Culkin.

44:02.200 --> 44:06.680
Ooh, it's Will Smith! Oh! So close!

44:06.720 --> 44:08.320
Now, then, Guz Khan.

44:08.360 --> 44:11.920
My initial feeling is it's
Huw Edwards, the news presenter,

44:11.960 --> 44:14.240
but...give me a minute.

44:14.280 --> 44:16.480
LAUGHTER It's a big JC, isn't it?

44:16.520 --> 44:19.720
It is a big JC.
It's Jesus Christ himself. Oh, wow.

44:19.760 --> 44:22.800
It is, without question, Madonna.

44:22.840 --> 44:24.640
Morgana is a different pop star.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.040
She's Cheryl Cole.

44:26.080 --> 44:29.520
I was thinking Vogue.
No, for BLEEP sake.

44:29.560 --> 44:32.720
LAUGHTER It is Cheryl Cole! I know.

44:32.760 --> 44:34.840
And finally, Victoria.

44:34.880 --> 44:38.440
What can it be,
with two hands out like that,

44:38.480 --> 44:42.080
and no tangible expression
on her face?

44:42.120 --> 44:44.800
Well, I mean,
that's pretty accurate.

44:44.840 --> 44:46.720
It's... Neville Chamberlain.

44:46.760 --> 44:49.280
Ooh. Actually, not that far off.

44:49.320 --> 44:50.560
It's John Craven.

44:50.600 --> 44:53.560
Hey! Well done, everyone.

44:53.600 --> 44:57.120
Come back down here, and we'll add
all that to the final scores!

44:57.160 --> 45:00.240
CHEERING AND APPLAUS

45:00.280 --> 45:02.840
Oh, here we are. Ooh.

45:02.880 --> 45:04.160
That was exciting, weren't it?

45:04.200 --> 45:06.880
It was lovely to have John Craven
and Jesus on the show.

45:08.520 --> 45:11.640
And you did some good guessing,
you got one of Desiree's right,

45:11.680 --> 45:13.440
you got one of Guz's right. I did.

45:13.480 --> 45:16.240
But one-and-a-half of Morgana's.
DESIREE: Hey.

45:16.280 --> 45:18.000
So, she takes the full five points.

45:18.040 --> 45:20.120
Well done, Morgana.
Well done, Morgana.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.480
How does that work?

45:21.520 --> 45:25.080
There's also one point each to
Victoria and Alan for coming last,

45:25.120 --> 45:27.560
and three points each for
Guz and Desiree.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.920
There you go.

45:28.960 --> 45:31.160
Something for nothing. Well done.
DESIREE LAUGHS

45:31.200 --> 45:33.000
Which means, the final scoreboard,

45:33.040 --> 45:35.480
it's been a tight opening episode,
Greg. I'm very excited.

45:35.520 --> 45:37.160
I genuinely don't know who's won.

45:37.200 --> 45:39.200
The winner, with 17 points...

45:39.240 --> 45:41.600
..is Morgana Robinson!
There it is!

45:41.640 --> 45:44.760
CHEERNG AND APPLAUSE
Morgana Robinson wins.

45:44.800 --> 45:48.040
Please go and have a celebratory
sit on your prizes! Whoo!

45:48.080 --> 45:49.520
Thank you.

45:50.920 --> 45:52.560
So, what have we learnt today?

45:52.600 --> 45:55.600
Well, we've learnt that life is
a continuous struggle,

45:55.640 --> 45:58.200
but if you apply yourself,
you can learn new skills,

45:58.240 --> 46:01.400
make new friends
and do great things.

46:01.440 --> 46:06.400
We've also learned you should never
borrow Alan Davies' toothbrush.

46:06.440 --> 46:09.440
See you for the second instalment
but for now, our first winner

46:09.480 --> 46:12.440
is Morgana Robinson!

46:35.840 --> 46:39.360
