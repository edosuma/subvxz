Whoa!
Oh, hey, guys.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.540
We're gonna
miss you, dude.

01:05.540 --> 01:07.210
Come on, Marco,
can't you stay
a little longer?

01:07.210 --> 01:09.250
Love to,
but Earth's calling.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.460
All right then,
see ya on
the flip, Marco.

01:11.460 --> 01:13.670
Whoa!!

01:15.750 --> 01:19.880
Uh, well, I guess
this is good-bye.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.330
And what a pleasure
it's been.

01:22.330 --> 01:24.830
This place won't be
the same without you, my lad.

01:24.830 --> 01:26.460
But before you go,

01:26.460 --> 01:27.880
there's something
I want to give you

01:27.880 --> 01:29.830
for all you've done
for our kingdom.

01:29.830 --> 01:32.710
Squire!
Ahem.

01:32.710 --> 01:35.000
Ta-da!

01:35.000 --> 01:37.380
Whoa! Cool.

01:37.380 --> 01:39.290
Ha ha, you're like
a real live knight now.

01:39.290 --> 01:41.000
Look at you, my boy.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.040
In fact, if you ever
want to be a knight one day,

01:43.040 --> 01:44.880
give me a call.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.460
Wow, thanks,
River.

01:46.460 --> 01:49.460
Take care of yourself
back on Earth.

01:49.460 --> 01:51.210
Thanks.

01:55.330 --> 01:57.000
I guess this is it.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Well, bye.

02:04.710 --> 02:06.120
Wait, Marco.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.750
I need a longer
good-bye than that.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.670
Me, too.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.670
Well, bye.

02:20.670 --> 02:22.290
Again.

02:22.290 --> 02:23.580
Bye.

02:23.580 --> 02:25.790
What... oh, you're
going to the portal.

02:25.790 --> 02:27.210
That's this way.

02:27.210 --> 02:28.750
- Uh...
- Oh...

02:38.920 --> 02:40.210
Well, bye.

02:40.210 --> 02:41.170
Bye.

02:41.170 --> 02:42.330
Bye.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.790
- Okay, Marco.
- Right.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.830
Oh, and can you let me know
if you see my hoodie anywhere?

02:49.830 --> 02:51.790
I told you
I haven't seen it,

02:51.790 --> 02:54.120
but if I find it,
I will send it to you.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.920
Okay, cool.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.960
Thanks. Okay.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.540
Bye.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.330
I'm... going
to my room.

03:03.330 --> 03:05.750
But sweetie pie,
your room's this way.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.290
Uh, yeah, it's wherever
I want it to be, Dad.

03:09.830 --> 03:12.420
Sparkle glitter
bomb expand.

03:37.420 --> 03:39.620
Gross, Marco.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.210
Smells like that time

03:41.210 --> 03:43.330
we went on that dimensional
school field trip!

03:45.210 --> 03:47.250
Ugh. Gonna vomit.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.170
And that smells like the one
time we got Chinese food

03:49.170 --> 03:52.040
after the double feature
karate movie!

03:53.420 --> 03:55.000
And that smells like the time

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
we tried to save
the bounce lounge.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.170
- Hey, girl!
- Pony Head!

04:00.170 --> 04:01.960
I heard what went down
in your kingdom,

04:01.960 --> 04:04.040
and so I rushed
right over as soon
as my hair was done.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.330
You know I need
to do that. Wait.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.880
Are you hiding
something from me?

04:07.880 --> 04:09.830
No. This is me.

04:09.830 --> 04:11.880
Totes normal.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.920
You better not be
keeping secrets from me.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.040
Okay, fine.
It's Marco's hoodie, okay?

04:17.040 --> 04:18.460
Are you happy now?

04:18.460 --> 04:20.500
Oooh!!

04:20.500 --> 04:22.920
Darn it, that thing
smells like feet.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.250
I know, but it smells
like Marco.

04:25.250 --> 04:27.580
I know I should return it,
but I really miss him,

04:27.580 --> 04:30.080
and it's the only thing...

04:30.080 --> 04:32.040
What the...
hey, what are you doing?

04:32.040 --> 04:34.040
I'm washing
this stinky thing.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.670
No!

04:38.290 --> 04:40.880
Hey, girl, you need
to get a grip.

04:40.880 --> 04:41.920
No.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.210
Where are you going?

04:43.210 --> 04:44.460
To get that hoodie.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.960
Yes? Ah,
Princess Butterfly.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.960
Hi, Lavabo.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.880
I must apologize
for your blue dress.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.210
It will not be ready
till Tuesday.

04:59.210 --> 05:00.620
I don't care.
I'm looking for
a red hoodie.

05:00.620 --> 05:02.710
A hoodie?
Date and time
you dropped it off.

05:02.710 --> 05:05.380
Just now,
but it was a total accident.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.920
It's perfectly clean.
I just need it back
before it gets washed.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.290
A clean hoodie?
Not to worry.

05:10.290 --> 05:12.380
You need
the pick-up window.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.210
Welcome to
the pick-up window.

05:14.210 --> 05:16.000
How may I be
of assistance?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.500
Red hoodie.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.420
- Medium maybe.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.120
Chain mail
or metal plate?

05:21.120 --> 05:22.750
Cotton.
It's a hoodie.

05:22.750 --> 05:27.000
- I don't know.
I don't count.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.040
There it is,
right behind you.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.080
Double stitch
or single?

05:31.080 --> 05:32.580
It's right behind you.

05:32.580 --> 05:34.120
That should be
enough information.

05:34.120 --> 05:37.580
I'll file this and get
back to you within 48 hours.

05:37.580 --> 05:39.120
What?!

05:39.120 --> 05:40.920
This is all your fault.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.460
You're gonna thank
me later,

05:42.460 --> 05:43.960
once you come
to your senses.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.670
I am to my senses.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.880
Good news. I have
located your hoodie.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.250
Unfortunately, it's filthy,
and must be washed immediately.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.880
What? No, no, no, no.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.000
I told you, it doesn't
need to be washed.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.500
Don't bother yourself.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.330
I'm sorry, princess,
but I must bother myself.

05:58.330 --> 05:59.960
It is my duty.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.750
I will never forget
the moment, as a young boy,

06:02.750 --> 06:05.960
and I saw my papi
meticulously making sure

06:05.960 --> 06:09.210
the royals' linen stayed
pure, noble, clean,

06:09.210 --> 06:11.330
- and fresh!
- Uh...

06:11.330 --> 06:12.960
And I swore at that very day

06:12.960 --> 06:15.670
that I would never let
a garment go unwashed,

06:15.670 --> 06:18.460
and I have kept that promise
for over 40 years.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.670
Therefore, I will make it
my utmost priority

06:20.670 --> 06:24.040
that this extremely soiled
hoodie be washed!

06:26.000 --> 06:28.750
Okay, well, that
is unfortunate,

06:28.750 --> 06:31.170
but now, let me
tell you about
this club I went to.

06:31.170 --> 06:33.040
Glitter whale
battering ram!

06:35.170 --> 06:37.120
Girl, what are
you doing?

06:37.120 --> 06:39.750
Trying to get
my hoodie back
before Lavabo washes it.

06:39.750 --> 06:42.120
Are you for real
right now?

06:42.120 --> 06:44.210
Piled river panda explosion!

06:46.460 --> 06:49.000
Through muddled scent
and stained shirt piles,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.540
the dirt of yesterday shall not
be the enemy of tomorrow.

06:52.540 --> 06:54.040
By the order of the Wash,

06:54.040 --> 06:56.420
this is my promise
to my true kingdom.

06:57.790 --> 06:59.080
Seriously?

06:59.080 --> 07:00.880
You know,
I'm surprised to say it,

07:00.880 --> 07:03.580
- but personally,
I really do admire this.

07:03.580 --> 07:06.500
Star, just let this old dad
do his job.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.460
Yes, I must
follow my duty.

07:08.460 --> 07:10.750
Order and rules are
always to be followed,
without fail.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.500
Okay, calm down though.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.080
Everyone must always
follow the rules

07:14.080 --> 07:16.250
all the time,
always, forever.

07:16.250 --> 07:20.250
What? Okay, did you just
tell my friend what to
do forever?

07:20.250 --> 07:22.250
We are getting back
your weird red stink hoodie.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.040
- We're getting it.
- Wait, wait, wait.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.620
- Two seconds ago,
you were like--
- I'm aware of my actions,

07:25.620 --> 07:28.250
and I'm so sorry for
not always having your back,

07:28.250 --> 07:30.120
and I hope we can move on
and grow as the beautiful
princesses we are.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.620
I must uphold my oath.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.710
No, no, no.
He can't wash the hoodie!

07:35.960 --> 07:37.290
Get back here, Lavabo.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.080
- Oh!
- Can't see anything!

07:41.080 --> 07:43.420
I know.
Let's split up.

07:43.420 --> 07:46.080
MARCO:  Good-bye
forever, Star.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.040
No, no, no, no.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.790
No! Don't go!

07:48.790 --> 07:51.210
I won't let you go.

07:51.210 --> 07:52.710
Ay!

07:53.790 --> 07:55.420
Lavabo!

07:55.420 --> 07:57.210
No. Give me
that hoodie!

07:57.210 --> 07:59.080
Your Highness, I can't
stress enough how badly

07:59.080 --> 08:00.960
I am not
going to do that.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.620
Huppa!

08:08.420 --> 08:11.710
Kitten Pegasus
battle barrel!

08:14.170 --> 08:16.920
Stop! You're not
washing that hoodie!

08:19.000 --> 08:20.880
Just give up.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.710
As long as this body of mine
is capable of moving,

08:23.710 --> 08:25.960
I shall always move
towards my duty.

08:27.790 --> 08:30.670
Shimmer soap tentacle wave!

08:39.710 --> 08:42.420
You're not moving towards
anything anymore.

08:42.420 --> 08:44.210
This is
your last chance.

08:44.210 --> 08:48.330
My entire life I have
dedicated to my knight's oath.

08:48.330 --> 08:50.420
This is something that
cannot be bent or broken.

08:50.420 --> 08:52.710
My brothers and sisters
taught me that.

08:52.710 --> 08:54.750
I cherish the moments
we had together,

08:54.750 --> 08:56.330
and hold onto them
every day.

08:56.330 --> 08:57.790
It has made me who I am,

08:57.790 --> 08:59.920
and soon, I shall
see them again.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.500
Wait, what?

09:01.500 --> 09:03.960
You thought I was
gonna kill you over a hoodie?

09:03.960 --> 09:06.120
Is that not what is
going on here?

09:06.120 --> 09:09.620
No. I was gonna maybe
turn you into a duck,

09:09.620 --> 09:11.960
or, like, boop you
on the nose real hard.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.250
But your eyes,
they had the blood lust.

09:14.250 --> 09:17.000
That's just 'cause...

09:17.000 --> 09:18.620
Pony Head was right.

09:18.620 --> 09:21.380
I really am messed up
about Marco.

09:21.380 --> 09:25.000
I mean, I spent all day
chasing down a knight

09:25.000 --> 09:27.250
who was just doing
his weird job.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.790
All because I thought that
if I didn't have Marco's hoodie,

09:29.790 --> 09:32.210
I wouldn't have
any piece of him left,

09:32.210 --> 09:34.540
which just isn't true.

09:34.540 --> 09:37.330
I'll always have Marco.
We'll always be friends.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.580
- Do not worry.

09:45.580 --> 09:47.580
I put it on
a gentle cycle.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.210
Miladies, the garment
is clean,

09:59.210 --> 10:02.420
and up to the standards
of the Knights of the Wash.

10:02.420 --> 10:05.420
Oh, wow.
Now that is delightful.

10:05.420 --> 10:08.540
Star, you should...
Awww...

10:08.540 --> 10:10.670
Aw, don't be pouty.

10:10.670 --> 10:12.380
Eh.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.420
Come over here.

10:14.420 --> 10:16.290
Milady, please.

10:19.210 --> 10:21.750
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

10:21.750 --> 10:24.380
It still stinks
like Marco!

10:24.380 --> 10:26.210
What?!
No, it does not.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.210
I just sniffed it.
Tell her it doesn't.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.250
The hoodie is,
in fact, clean.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.960
What you are experiencing
is the memory of a scent.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.040
You don't need to hold on to
stinky hoodies any more,

10:35.040 --> 10:36.540
you know why?

10:36.540 --> 10:38.330
'Cause, like,
what we have learned

10:38.330 --> 10:40.210
is that
Earth Turd's scent

10:40.210 --> 10:42.290
is like in your heart
or whatever.

10:42.290 --> 10:43.960
Thanks, Pony Head.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.960
You got it, girl.

10:54.170 --> 10:56.080
Hello?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.290
All right!
My hoodie!

11:08.460 --> 11:10.710
Hey, kinda smells
like Star.
