00:02.461 --> 00:03.893
<i>From the national headline</i>
<i>at Hurricane Centere and Rob,</i>

00:03.965 --> 00:06.331
<i>is that Iris is nearing</i>
<i>category-2 strength.</i>

00:07.314 --> 00:09.481
<i>It is 625 miles</i>
<i>east of Nassau</i>

00:09.515 --> 00:11.647
<i>and about 800 miles</i>
<i>to the east-southeast</i>

00:11.682 --> 00:13.381
<i>of Miami right now.</i>

00:13.415 --> 00:15.348
<i>Again, it appears</i>
<i>from the satellite</i>

00:15.383 --> 00:17.516
<i>that we have</i>
<i>a strengthening hurricane,</i>

00:17.551 --> 00:20.383
<i>and a new advisory should be in</i>
<i>in about 10 minutes or so.</i>

00:20.417 --> 00:22.817
<i>This is the visual</i>
<i>satellite picture.</i>

00:22.851 --> 00:26.353
<i>And as the sun comes up,</i>
<i>you get a very, very nice look</i>

00:26.387 --> 00:27.687
<i>at the eye.</i>

00:27.722 --> 00:30.123
<i>You can also see how bright</i>
<i>these white clouds are</i>

00:30.157 --> 00:31.157
<i>around the center.</i>

00:31.191 --> 00:32.491
<i>This is the latest advisory.</i>

00:32.526 --> 00:34.327
<i>Iris is an extremely dangerous</i>
<i>hurricane</i>

00:34.361 --> 00:38.329
<i>with current maximum sustained</i>
<i>winds of 100 miles per hour.</i>

00:38.364 --> 00:40.263
<i>Preparations to protect life</i>
<i>and property...</i>

00:40.297 --> 00:42.761
Hey!
The kid is stealing duct tape!

00:42.796 --> 00:45.462
Hey, kid!
Hey, kid, stop!

00:51.863 --> 00:55.094
Hey, kid, get back here!

01:33.117 --> 01:35.152
In my experience,

01:35.186 --> 01:37.487
hurricanes bring out
the crazies.

01:37.522 --> 01:40.122
In my experience, crazies don't
need an excuse to come out.

01:40.157 --> 01:41.855
I'm just glad
my family's out of town.

01:41.889 --> 01:44.090
Well, her name
is Valerie Raines.

01:44.124 --> 01:45.657
Any cash she had was gone.

01:45.691 --> 01:47.858
Credit cards
are still here, though.

01:47.893 --> 01:49.293
Wallet was open.
No cash.

01:49.327 --> 01:51.327
It looks like the motive
was robbery.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.295
I don't know --
her license is gone

01:53.329 --> 01:55.329
and, by the imprint
in this wallet,

01:55.364 --> 01:56.563
so is one of her cards.

01:56.597 --> 01:58.531
Maybe the killer
just took one credit card.

01:58.565 --> 01:59.932
Yeah, an ungreedy thief.

01:59.967 --> 02:01.366
Whatever. Listen...

02:01.401 --> 02:03.468
We got to put this investigation
on ice and get indoors.

02:03.502 --> 02:04.735
I got to get to the hospital.

02:04.769 --> 02:06.269
Are you not feeling well?

02:06.304 --> 02:08.336
I'm a doctor.
I've been assigned there.

02:08.371 --> 02:10.770
It's all hands on deck
because of this hurricane.

02:10.806 --> 02:13.340
Well, I hope you feel better.

02:13.374 --> 02:15.475
Did you even hear
half of what I said?

02:15.509 --> 02:16.909
What are you looking at?

02:16.943 --> 02:18.876
Never seen a hurricane before.

02:18.911 --> 02:21.178
You don't "see" hurricanes.

02:21.212 --> 02:23.180
You hang on for dear life
and hope your house

02:23.214 --> 02:24.414
is still there in the morning.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.081
It's just a little wind
and rain, right?

02:26.116 --> 02:27.349
A category-2?

02:27.383 --> 02:29.450
"Just a little wind and rain"?
Yeah, right.

02:29.485 --> 02:30.851
"2" doesn't sound so bad.

02:30.886 --> 02:31.985
Let me put it this way --

02:32.020 --> 02:35.221
a category-1 can rip that tree
out of the ground

02:35.256 --> 02:39.358
and drive it through the window
of a house three miles away.

02:39.392 --> 02:41.059
So between that...

02:41.094 --> 02:43.194
And this...

02:43.229 --> 02:46.730
You could be in
for the ride of your life.

02:50.534 --> 02:52.802
Some say
I don't play well with others.

02:52.836 --> 02:55.237
I was a damn good Detective
in Chicago

02:55.271 --> 02:57.005
until a disagreement
with my boss

02:57.040 --> 02:59.441
encouraged me to pack it up
and make a change.

02:59.475 --> 03:01.142
So I put the Windy City
in my rearview

03:01.176 --> 03:02.609
and headed
to the Sunshine State

03:02.644 --> 03:05.678
to kick back, play some golf,
work on my tan,

03:05.712 --> 03:07.479
maybe write the occasional
speeding ticket.

03:07.514 --> 03:10.115
Yeah, well...

03:10.149 --> 03:11.750
That didn't work out.

03:11.760 --> 03:15.560

03:18.588 --> 03:20.723
Yeah, that's what Carlos said,
but I have my doubts.

03:20.758 --> 03:22.391
Driver's license was missing,

03:22.426 --> 03:24.359
but a whole bunch of credit
cards were still in her wallet.

03:24.394 --> 03:25.994
Hey, don't worry about it.
I'm on it.

03:26.028 --> 03:27.763
Oh. Hey.
Hey.

03:27.797 --> 03:30.700
Lauren, I want them lined up
all down the hallway, okay?
Okay.

03:30.734 --> 03:31.801
What's up?

03:31.836 --> 03:33.203
I just parked a body
in your morgue.

03:33.237 --> 03:34.471
Woman with
the last name "Raines"

03:34.505 --> 03:35.839
was shot outside
a convenience store.

03:35.874 --> 03:37.474
"Raines dies during hurricane"?

03:37.509 --> 03:38.876
Yeah, and speaking
of the hurricane,

03:38.910 --> 03:40.410
I was just wondering how you're...
Can you hold on a sec?

03:40.445 --> 03:41.545
Doing.

03:41.579 --> 03:42.713
Cargill.

03:44.282 --> 03:46.016
Okay. Yeah.

03:46.050 --> 03:47.751
Thanks.

03:47.785 --> 03:48.852
Something wrong?

03:48.886 --> 03:51.021
The hurricane's been upped
to a category-4.

03:51.055 --> 03:52.989
4. That's like two 2s.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.924
I told Jeff I'd go
and get him an hour ago

03:54.959 --> 03:56.025
and bring him here, but --

03:56.060 --> 03:57.794
I can get him.
You're on a case.

03:57.828 --> 03:58.862
Yeah, just barely.

03:58.896 --> 04:00.997
And with the hurricane,
you're up to it,

04:01.032 --> 04:04.501
so, seriously, not a problem.

04:04.535 --> 04:07.637
Thank you.
I would really appreciate it.

04:07.672 --> 04:09.272
So helpful.

04:11.776 --> 04:13.243
Not a problem.

04:13.277 --> 04:14.544
No, Mr. Mayor,

04:14.579 --> 04:17.014
I asked for a mandatory
evacuation of that sector,

04:17.048 --> 04:18.748
and <i>you</i> made it voluntary.

04:19.950 --> 04:22.185
Yeah, all due respect,
are you out of your mind?

04:22.219 --> 04:23.419
Hey! No, no, no, no!

04:23.453 --> 04:24.619
The holding cells are full.

04:24.654 --> 04:25.887
Take them
to the conference room.

04:25.922 --> 04:28.756
All overflow goes
to the conference room.

04:31.258 --> 04:34.092
Daniel, I didn't think you'd make it
in on that scooter of yours.

04:34.127 --> 04:35.660
Thanks for calling me in,
Director Manus.

04:35.694 --> 04:36.794
I really appreciate it.

04:36.829 --> 04:38.062
Yeah, well, you're welcome,

04:38.097 --> 04:39.730
but you might want to hang on
to that appreciation.

04:39.765 --> 04:41.199
We've got a long, very challenging

04:41.233 --> 04:42.534
48 hours ahead of us.

04:42.568 --> 04:44.769
Oh, believe me, I'd much rather
be here than my place.

04:44.804 --> 04:47.072
I live in a one-room apartment
over a garage

04:47.106 --> 04:49.207
that I'm not really sure
can stand up to these winds.

04:49.242 --> 04:51.142
Well, in that case,
you're welcome.

04:51.177 --> 04:52.378
What do you need me to do?

04:52.412 --> 04:53.879
Well, there's no shortage
of phones to answer.

04:53.914 --> 04:56.248
So pick a fire and put it out.

05:01.220 --> 05:03.154
There she is. Hey.

05:03.188 --> 05:05.956
Hey.
Iggy? Really?

05:05.990 --> 05:07.657
Someone thought
it was appropriate

05:07.691 --> 05:09.392
to bring an iguana
into a hospital?

05:09.426 --> 05:12.261
All right, look, I wasn't about to leave
Iggy during a hurricane, okay?

05:12.295 --> 05:14.863
Which made a lot more sense before
we saw that look on your face.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.231
Yeah, well, it's fine.

05:16.265 --> 05:18.032
Just make sure
he doesn't get out.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.767
How bad is it outside?

05:19.801 --> 05:21.868
Yeah, it's not bad.
A little wind and rain.

05:21.903 --> 05:24.537
Yeah, right. He, like, white-knuckled it
the whole way here.

05:24.571 --> 05:26.772
Well, I thought it tore out
trees by the roots

05:26.806 --> 05:28.040
and tore down buildings.

05:28.074 --> 05:29.341
It hasn't hit landfall yet.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.076
You'll know when it does.
Trust me.

05:31.110 --> 05:32.976
Come on --
I'm gonna show you and Iggy

05:33.010 --> 05:34.344
where you can
get out of the way.

05:34.378 --> 05:36.478
I already know where to go.

05:36.512 --> 05:37.913
Hey, remember that, um, woman

05:37.947 --> 05:40.181
that you were telling me about
with the last name "Raines"?

05:40.216 --> 05:41.550
Was her first name
Valerie?

05:41.584 --> 05:42.718
Yeah. Why?

05:42.752 --> 05:44.052
Well, a homeless woman came in

05:44.086 --> 05:46.654
trying to use
her insurance card today.

05:46.688 --> 05:48.356
Is that her?
Yeah.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.091
And that is our hospital
insurance administrator.

05:51.126 --> 05:54.995
Good luck with her.
She's a peach.

05:55.029 --> 05:56.462
Detective Longworth?
Yeah.

05:56.497 --> 05:59.598
Carol Watkins, hospital
insurance administrator.

05:59.632 --> 06:03.134
Now, I believe that this woman
is a person of interest.

06:03.169 --> 06:04.469
Is that how you say it?

06:04.503 --> 06:05.470
That's what we call it.

06:05.504 --> 06:08.406
Well, then,
here is the insurance card

06:08.440 --> 06:11.141
and the driver's license
that she tried to use.

06:11.176 --> 06:13.510
People are always trying to pull
a fast one on this hospital,

06:13.544 --> 06:15.011
but they have to
get through me first

06:15.045 --> 06:18.214
because I make sure everyone's
insurance is in order.

06:18.248 --> 06:20.482
I've never been part
of a murder investigation.

06:20.517 --> 06:23.252
You think she killed
the real Valerie Raines?

06:23.286 --> 06:25.521
Excuse me.
Did you steal this card?

06:25.555 --> 06:28.790
Yeah.
That dead lady.

06:28.825 --> 06:32.127
Sorry.

06:32.161 --> 06:33.695
I'm -- I'm just so sick.

06:34.897 --> 06:36.865
Did you see anything
involved in the attack,

06:36.899 --> 06:38.066
anyone hanging around?

06:38.100 --> 06:40.669
No. Dead.

06:40.703 --> 06:42.303
She was dead.

06:42.338 --> 06:44.906
That's all I saw.

06:44.940 --> 06:46.808
Having that driver's license
and insurance card

06:46.842 --> 06:48.343
makes her guilty
of something, right?

06:48.377 --> 06:50.011
Yeah, of trying to treat a cough.

06:50.045 --> 06:52.881
Do you know what? Treat her.
Send me the bill.

06:54.216 --> 06:57.485
That is what county hospital
is for!

06:57.519 --> 06:59.220
Yes, yes, I understand

06:59.255 --> 07:01.256
you have people
pounding on your door.

07:01.290 --> 07:02.390
But there's no way in hell

07:02.425 --> 07:04.226
I can dispatch a unit
to the high-school gym

07:04.261 --> 07:06.963
because you can't handle
the overflow.

07:06.997 --> 07:08.699
You know what?
Here's a concept.

07:08.733 --> 07:10.467
Put on a damn raincoat,
go outside,

07:10.502 --> 07:12.603
and tell them yourself
there's no more cots.

07:12.638 --> 07:14.139
What?

07:14.173 --> 07:15.640
Oh. Sorry.

07:15.675 --> 07:19.745
I know this probably
isn't, uh, a good time.

07:19.779 --> 07:21.947
Speak.

07:21.982 --> 07:24.517
Apparently another body
was found shot.

07:26.253 --> 07:27.887
Excellent.

07:42.105 --> 07:44.172
Where's the crime scene?!

07:46.207 --> 07:48.840
The limo!
The body's in the limo!

07:48.874 --> 07:50.441
Go, go, go!

07:50.476 --> 07:53.777
Great. Aah!

08:00.381 --> 08:02.413
This is not exactly
crime-scene protocol.

08:02.447 --> 08:05.446
Yeah, it's not exactly
protocol weather out there.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.348
I know this guy.
This is Dennis Peterson.

08:10.383 --> 08:12.517
Okay.
You don't know Dennis Peterson?

08:12.551 --> 08:14.085
I know he's dead.
Tweezers?

08:14.119 --> 08:16.086
The motivational speaker,
self-help author?

08:16.120 --> 08:17.621
You're into that kind of thing?

08:17.655 --> 08:19.255
Who, me? No.
I don't need motivation.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.556
I didn't say you did.

08:20.591 --> 08:23.959
He's all into that positive
thinking, visualization thing.

08:23.994 --> 08:25.928
Oh, yeah? Well, positive
thinking and visualization

08:25.962 --> 08:27.896
didn't stop a bullet
from going through his head.

08:27.930 --> 08:29.664
But this headrest did.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.433
What was the caliber of the bullet

08:32.467 --> 08:33.967
that you pulled
out of Valerie Raines?

08:34.001 --> 08:35.403
9-millimeter hollow point.

08:35.437 --> 08:37.404
9-millimeter hollow point.

08:37.438 --> 08:39.005
That's weird.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.607
Two killings so close together

08:41.642 --> 08:44.009
on exactly the same day
with the same weapon?

08:45.111 --> 08:47.245
I may be a Chicago boy,
but, uh...

08:47.280 --> 08:49.547
Do hurricanes normally trigger
spree killings?

08:55.785 --> 08:57.019
If this is a spree killing,
we need to to connect them now.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.154
Peterson lists his address
as New York.

09:01.188 --> 09:03.890
Valerie Raines is a local,
so that ain't happening.

09:06.093 --> 09:08.727
This guy had a speaking
engagement in town in two hours.

09:08.761 --> 09:10.461
Well, that's not gonna happen,
either.

09:10.496 --> 09:11.762
I'm gonna go talk
to the limo driver.

09:11.797 --> 09:13.430
Good. I could use
some room in here.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.768
How soon can you get me the ballistics report
on those two bullets?

09:15.802 --> 09:18.570
Tuesday maybe, after the storm's blown through.
I need them today.

09:18.605 --> 09:21.039
You do realize iris is
about to make landfall, right?

09:21.073 --> 09:22.607
If those two bullets match,
we got a spree killing.

09:22.641 --> 09:25.143
If we get a spree killing, that storm's
not gonna stop the killer.

09:25.177 --> 09:26.477
My lab is in
the evacuation route.

09:26.511 --> 09:28.112
There's no way I can
get back there right now.

09:28.146 --> 09:29.747
On the positive side,
if they don't match,

09:29.781 --> 09:31.982
we grab a six-pack and ride out
the storm in the hospital.

09:33.951 --> 09:36.852
Fine. How do you expect me
to do that without my equipment?

09:36.887 --> 09:39.221
Through positive thinking
and visualization.

09:39.255 --> 09:40.688
Excuse me, buddy.

09:40.723 --> 09:43.624
Whoa! Are you crazy?!

09:49.329 --> 09:51.063
Whoo!

09:51.098 --> 09:52.264
Am I in custody?

09:52.299 --> 09:55.068
Well, I don't know.
Should you be?

09:55.102 --> 09:56.269
No.

09:56.303 --> 09:58.037
What happened?

09:58.071 --> 10:00.739
I picked up Mr. Peterson
from the Grand Hotel,

10:00.773 --> 10:02.940
and I was taking him
to the airport.

10:02.975 --> 10:04.708
What about his
speaking engagement?

10:04.743 --> 10:07.610
I guess the hurricane
changed his mind about that.

10:07.644 --> 10:08.744
So you stopped here.

10:08.778 --> 10:10.178
Yeah, he wanted coffee.

10:10.213 --> 10:12.246
I went in, and I grabbed him
a half-caf cappuccino,

10:12.281 --> 10:14.448
I came out,
and I found him like that.

10:14.482 --> 10:16.451
I spilled piping-hot coffee
all over myself.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.053
I think I need medical attention.

10:18.088 --> 10:20.023
Yeah, well, I just came
from the hospital.

10:20.057 --> 10:21.658
I'd think twice about that
if I were you.

10:21.692 --> 10:23.559
Mr. Peterson
was my favorite customer.

10:23.594 --> 10:24.861
Good tipper, I'm guessing.

10:24.895 --> 10:27.596
He always used our service,
and he always requested me.

10:27.630 --> 10:29.197
Wow -- high praise
from the high priest

10:29.232 --> 10:30.799
of pulling wool
over people's eyes, huh?

10:30.833 --> 10:32.767
How often
did he come into town?

10:32.802 --> 10:35.003
I don't know. Maybe three times
last month.

10:35.037 --> 10:36.371
Huh.

10:36.406 --> 10:39.007
Geez. Florida.

10:51.221 --> 10:53.489
I'm sorry.
I'm closing in five minutes.

10:53.523 --> 10:55.157
Can I get a small black, please?

10:55.192 --> 10:56.292
A what?

10:56.326 --> 10:58.227
Small coffee, black, to go?

10:58.261 --> 11:00.997
Hey, did a, uh, guy
in a black suit

11:01.031 --> 11:02.798
come in here
about an hour and a half ago,

11:02.833 --> 11:04.300
ordered a half-caf cappuccino?

11:04.334 --> 11:06.135
Yeah, sounds about right.

11:06.169 --> 11:07.236
Did he seem nervous?

11:07.270 --> 11:08.938
Not really, no.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.573
Oh.
Here you go.

11:12.075 --> 11:13.409
Uh, thank you.

11:13.443 --> 11:16.245
Thank you.
Thanks.

11:17.681 --> 11:19.549
Aah!

11:19.583 --> 11:21.884
Whew!

11:21.919 --> 11:23.786
It's really
coming down out there.

11:23.820 --> 11:26.522
Yeah. Is this
your first hurricane?

11:26.556 --> 11:27.756
Uh, does it get much worse?

11:27.791 --> 11:28.958
Oh, man, you have no idea.

11:28.992 --> 11:31.560
Oh.

11:45.308 --> 11:46.541
What's going on?

11:46.576 --> 11:48.143
We have to evacuate this wing.

11:48.177 --> 11:50.309
Everyone has to be
on the lower two floors.

11:50.344 --> 11:51.210
Were you assigned here?

11:51.245 --> 11:52.410
Yeah, but I need to know --

11:52.445 --> 11:54.212
do you have a spectrometer
in the hospital?

11:54.246 --> 11:55.579
I got to do a bullet analysis,

11:55.614 --> 11:57.314
and I can't make it back
to the substation.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.216
Watch your back. Coming through.
Well, maybe, like, a really old one.

11:59.250 --> 12:00.617
But can't it wait?

12:00.651 --> 12:02.252
Unfortunately, no.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.754
Uh, okay,
on the first-floor storage.

12:04.788 --> 12:06.789
But can you grab a gurney?
We're shorthanded.

12:06.823 --> 12:09.091
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just grab a bed.
Everyone's got to go.

12:09.125 --> 12:10.626
All right.

12:10.660 --> 12:12.161
Let's go.

12:12.195 --> 12:15.931
What a commotion, huh?

12:15.966 --> 12:19.735
How are they going to squeeze
everyone into two floors?

12:19.769 --> 12:22.438
Keyword is "squeeze."

12:22.472 --> 12:24.006
Uh, Evelyn, is it?

12:24.040 --> 12:25.207
Uh.

12:25.241 --> 12:27.476
I-I haven't seen you here before.

12:27.510 --> 12:29.644
Yeah, I'm just here
because of the hurricane.

12:29.679 --> 12:31.313
I'm the county medical examiner.

12:31.347 --> 12:33.548
You mean like a coroner?

12:33.582 --> 12:35.283
Yeah.

12:35.318 --> 12:36.585
Oh.

12:36.619 --> 12:38.120
Where are you taking me?

12:38.154 --> 12:39.922
Just downstairs.

12:39.956 --> 12:41.990
Am I going to die?
What?

12:42.024 --> 12:44.025
Did someone tell you I'm dying?

12:44.059 --> 12:45.659
No.

12:45.694 --> 12:49.230
I want somebody else to push me!

13:04.079 --> 13:05.612
Hi. Excuse me.
Hi. Bye-bye.

13:05.647 --> 13:06.814
Can I help you?

13:06.848 --> 13:08.649
I'm investigating the murder
of Dennis Peterson.

13:08.683 --> 13:11.018
Murder?
Yeah, he was shot in the back of his limo.

13:11.052 --> 13:13.287
My God. He just checked out
a few hours ago.

13:13.321 --> 13:15.155
Did he seem concerned?
No.

13:15.190 --> 13:17.558
He was positive and friendly,
like always.

13:17.592 --> 13:20.060
Why was he in town
three times last month?

13:20.094 --> 13:21.295
Speaking engagements.

13:21.329 --> 13:24.064
Yeah, well, see,
I have his calendar.

13:24.098 --> 13:27.234
He didn't have any speaking
engagements last month.

13:27.268 --> 13:29.669
So you want to have a go
answering that one again?

13:29.704 --> 13:32.138
This hotel endeavors to
protect its guests' privacy.

13:32.173 --> 13:34.207
For the live ones, anyway.
Peterson's dead.

13:34.241 --> 13:36.276
So I'm sure there's not
a premium on his privacy now,

13:36.310 --> 13:38.078
especially if it helps me
catch his murderer.

13:38.112 --> 13:40.113
You don't want to stand
in the way of that, do you?

13:40.147 --> 13:43.182
All I know is that each
of those three times last month,

13:43.217 --> 13:44.584
a doctor came to see him.

13:44.618 --> 13:45.985
What, a house call?
Yes.

13:46.020 --> 13:48.087
Why did Peterson need a doctor?
I don't know.

13:48.122 --> 13:50.189
Well, do you know
doctor's name?

13:50.224 --> 13:52.291
Don't know that, either.
Oh.

13:52.326 --> 13:54.193
All I know is that Peterson
scheduled spa treatments

13:54.228 --> 13:55.828
right after each
of those doctor visits.

13:55.862 --> 13:57.763
Huh.

13:57.798 --> 13:58.931
Thank you.

14:01.768 --> 14:04.603
Hey, I can't take
your call. Leave a message.

14:04.638 --> 14:08.774
Hey, Callie, call me
as soon as you get this message.

14:11.678 --> 14:12.911
Callie?

14:12.946 --> 14:14.113
Who's Callie?

14:14.147 --> 14:16.115
Uh, any more information
on Valerie Raines?

14:16.149 --> 14:18.150
Yeah, she worked as
a human-resource director

14:18.184 --> 14:20.385
at a local medical-instrument
manufacturing company.

14:20.420 --> 14:21.853
All right, well, I'm gonna need

14:21.888 --> 14:23.689
a list of employees
and former employees.

14:23.723 --> 14:25.957
Yeah, well, the company is
closed because of the hurricane,

14:25.992 --> 14:27.893
and we're having trouble
tracking down that list.

14:27.927 --> 14:30.495
Oh, and another thing --
I just spoke to Carlos,

14:30.530 --> 14:32.130
and he confirmed
that the same gun

14:32.165 --> 14:34.800
killed both Valerie Raines
and Dennis Peterson.

14:36.936 --> 14:38.270
Sorry. What?!

14:38.304 --> 14:40.739
You need to get your ass inside!

14:40.773 --> 14:43.041
Yeah, I'm doing just that.
Good.

14:43.075 --> 14:45.544
At the place where Peterson had
his last speaking engagement.

14:45.578 --> 14:46.711
I need to find a link

14:46.746 --> 14:48.513
between Valerie Raines
and Dennis Peterson.

14:48.547 --> 14:51.449
And at least I know where Peterson
was gonna be in a few hours.

14:51.483 --> 14:53.951
Detective? Jim?

15:02.027 --> 15:03.728
Bill Taylor?
Is that you?

15:03.762 --> 15:05.062
No.

15:05.097 --> 15:06.530
Really?

15:06.565 --> 15:09.566
Wow. Um, the resemblance
is uncanny.

15:09.601 --> 15:10.634
Uh, sorry.

15:10.668 --> 15:12.035
Oh, you're here for the reunion?

15:12.070 --> 15:13.136
Yeah, I just dropped in

15:13.171 --> 15:15.105
to say hi to as many people
as possible.

15:15.139 --> 15:16.873
It's probably hard to believe now,

15:16.907 --> 15:18.574
but I was the Homecoming Queen
of our class, so...

15:18.608 --> 15:20.976
It's not hard to believe at all.

15:21.011 --> 15:22.378
Well, no wonder I was confused.

15:22.412 --> 15:24.647
Bill was also a gigantic flirt.

15:27.050 --> 15:30.852
I should be going before
the storm gets worse.

15:31.554 --> 15:32.654
Have fun.

15:32.689 --> 15:34.522
Bye.

15:35.791 --> 15:37.492
Hey. Eddie?

15:37.526 --> 15:38.492
Hey, man.
Hey, man.

15:38.527 --> 15:39.793
Put this in coat check for me.

15:39.828 --> 15:41.796
What am I, your valet now?
Gee, I can't believe it.

15:41.830 --> 15:42.797
I'll see you inside.

15:42.831 --> 15:45.634
All right, I'll see you
in there. Bye.

15:47.637 --> 15:49.806
I'm just going to the bar.
Whoa.

15:49.841 --> 15:51.041
Hey.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.144
You need to get the nametag on.

15:53.178 --> 15:54.545
Seriously?

15:54.579 --> 15:57.581
You're telling me I need
to get one of those badges?

16:05.991 --> 16:07.057
Bill?

16:08.927 --> 16:09.927
Becky?

16:09.961 --> 16:11.228
How you doing?!

16:11.262 --> 16:12.429
Long time, no see.

16:16.916 --> 16:19.217
I am so glad
you could make it, Bill.

16:19.252 --> 16:21.386
Yay!
Hey!

16:21.420 --> 16:23.654
Yeah, you know, I wouldn't
have missed it for the world.

16:23.689 --> 16:25.356
Oh, well, the ballroom's
through that door.

16:25.390 --> 16:28.158
Only the out-of-towners and true
partiers are sticking it out.

16:28.193 --> 16:29.259
We're gonna have a blast!

16:29.293 --> 16:30.593
Hey, uh...

16:30.628 --> 16:32.829
Is Dennis Peterson
gonna make an appearance?

16:32.863 --> 16:33.996
Yeah, right.

16:34.031 --> 16:35.597
In this weather?
Not likely.

16:35.632 --> 16:38.333
Eddie, you came back.

16:38.367 --> 16:40.101
Roads are bad,
traffic was for shit.

16:40.135 --> 16:41.535
How long were you gone?

16:41.570 --> 16:43.170
What's it to you?

16:43.204 --> 16:45.072
Always in fight mode.

16:45.106 --> 16:46.706
Here -- at least
wear your name tag.

16:46.741 --> 16:48.408
I'm not putting that thing on.

16:48.442 --> 16:51.009
Then you can wait out the storm
in the lobby, mister. No name tag, no party.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.547
Guess what our featured drink is.

16:56.581 --> 16:57.547
Hurricanes?

16:57.582 --> 16:59.249
Bingo!

16:59.283 --> 17:00.717
Hey, uh,
why are you so certain

17:00.751 --> 17:01.986
that Peterson won't show?

17:02.020 --> 17:05.257
Why are you so interested?

17:05.291 --> 17:08.294
Oh. Bill.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.401
Hi!

17:44.428 --> 17:46.362
Yeah?
You called earlier?

17:46.396 --> 17:48.431
Oh, we had another guy
who was murdered today.

17:48.465 --> 17:50.199
Guy by the name
of Dennis Peterson.

17:50.233 --> 17:51.700
What, the self-help guy?

17:51.734 --> 17:54.603
Yeah, he had a doctor come to
his hotel three times last month.

17:54.637 --> 17:56.738
I need to know if that doctor
came from your hospital

17:56.773 --> 17:57.973
and, if he did,

17:58.007 --> 17:59.539
what went on during those visits.

17:59.573 --> 18:02.808
You know, if he's a patient,
that's privileged information.

18:04.577 --> 18:06.878
Yeah, I know.
I'd get a warrant.

18:06.913 --> 18:10.014
But I'm kind of in the middle
of a spree killing...
Hi. How are you?

18:10.048 --> 18:12.250
...That's kind of
in the middle of a hurricane.

18:12.284 --> 18:13.449
Mmm.

18:13.484 --> 18:15.051
A spree killing?

18:15.085 --> 18:18.053
Well, that's why Carlos
was so distracted today.

18:18.087 --> 18:21.323
Believe me -- I wouldn't ask
if there was any other way.

18:22.925 --> 18:24.091
Look, how about this?

18:24.126 --> 18:26.560
If it looks like something
you should tell me,

18:26.594 --> 18:27.794
then tell me.

18:27.829 --> 18:31.164
If not, his privileged
information stays privileged.

18:35.268 --> 18:37.770
Let me think about that,
and I have to get this.

18:37.804 --> 18:40.072
Sure.

18:40.106 --> 18:42.474
Reverse-charge call
from Raiford Prison.

18:42.509 --> 18:45.177
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.244
Hey, baby.

18:46.279 --> 18:47.912
Ray.

18:47.947 --> 18:49.747
Heard you guys are having
some weather out there.

18:49.781 --> 18:52.082
Yeah, well,
it's not that bad yet.

18:52.116 --> 18:53.449
You guys at the hospital?

18:53.484 --> 18:54.484
Yeah.

18:54.518 --> 18:55.518
Jeff with you?

18:55.552 --> 18:57.253
Yeah, he is.

18:57.287 --> 19:01.358
We, um, we boarded up the house
and battened down the hatches.

19:01.392 --> 19:03.193
Hey, I'm not worried
about the house.

19:03.227 --> 19:05.862
I just want to make sure that
my baby and my boy are safe.

19:08.098 --> 19:09.498
We're fine.

19:10.667 --> 19:12.533
It's good to hear your voice.

19:15.570 --> 19:17.570
Yeah.

19:17.605 --> 19:19.639
You know what, Ray?
I'm sorry. I'm just --

19:19.673 --> 19:21.107
I'm really busy here.

19:22.109 --> 19:24.410
It's all right.

19:24.444 --> 19:26.278
Can I talk to the little man?

19:26.312 --> 19:27.979
Yeah, he's right here.

19:28.013 --> 19:29.814
Jeff.
Yeah.

19:29.849 --> 19:31.082
It's your dad.

19:31.117 --> 19:32.350
Oh, hey, dad.

19:32.384 --> 19:35.152
Hey, buddy.

19:35.186 --> 19:36.286
How you doing?

19:36.320 --> 19:39.155
Yeah, everything's
all right so far.

20:07.189 --> 20:09.056
Bill Taylor!

20:09.091 --> 20:11.258
Nicole Gelber.
How you doing?

20:11.293 --> 20:13.627
You don't have to pretend
that you remember me.

20:13.661 --> 20:15.662
I remember <i>you.</i>
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

20:15.696 --> 20:18.197
I had an eensy-weensy,
little crush on you.

20:18.231 --> 20:19.432
You want to dance?

20:19.466 --> 20:21.266
Oh, hell yeah.

20:21.301 --> 20:22.467
But, you know, uh,

20:22.502 --> 20:24.069
I'm just gonna say hello
to a friend first.

20:24.103 --> 20:25.803
Okay, then, before the night is out.

20:25.838 --> 20:27.171
Oh, you pick a song, girl.

20:27.206 --> 20:28.272
You got it.

20:28.306 --> 20:31.275
Mm.

20:37.148 --> 20:40.015
Uh! Jason?!

20:41.817 --> 20:44.119
Bill.
Bill Taylor.

20:49.057 --> 20:50.625
Yeah, what was the name
of that, uh, teacher?

20:50.659 --> 20:51.692
Mr. Miller.

20:51.727 --> 20:53.361
Mr. Miller.
God.

20:53.395 --> 20:54.629
I'm sorry.

20:54.663 --> 20:56.997
I-I'm usually pretty good
at putting names to faces.

20:57.031 --> 20:58.264
You're a doctor?

20:58.298 --> 20:59.464
Oh, yeah, yeah, doctor.

20:59.499 --> 21:02.033
I always had you pegged
for a doctor, or physicist.

21:02.068 --> 21:04.235
You know you were always
the smartest guy in the class.

21:05.904 --> 21:08.606
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.607
You used to sit in the back
of the class.

21:10.642 --> 21:12.742
So Miller wouldn't call on me.

21:12.777 --> 21:14.277
Yeah, that's right! Yeah!

21:14.312 --> 21:16.345
Yeah, hey, you were
in the Chess Club, right,

21:16.380 --> 21:17.713
with, uh, Dennis...

21:17.747 --> 21:19.381
Uh, Dennis, uh, Peterson.

21:19.415 --> 21:20.782
Peterson. Yeah.
Yeah.

21:20.816 --> 21:22.883
Yeah. You guys
still keep in touch?

21:22.918 --> 21:25.486
Oh, we drifted apart
after High School.

21:25.520 --> 21:28.622
Oh. Yeah, I wonder why
he didn't show up, huh?

21:28.656 --> 21:29.956
I'm sure he would've
wanted to, huh?

21:29.991 --> 21:31.391
Uh-huh. Why?

21:31.425 --> 21:33.792
To see how all his conquests
look after 20 years.

21:33.827 --> 21:35.294
Conquests?

21:35.328 --> 21:37.228
Oh, he nailed every hottie
in High School.

21:37.262 --> 21:39.632
I mean, he had a silver tongue,
even back then, you know?

21:39.666 --> 21:41.101
It's no wonder

21:41.135 --> 21:43.302
he's made millions
as a motivational speaker.

21:43.337 --> 21:44.670
Hell yeah.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.839
Oh.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.640
Ah. Got to take this.
Oh.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.141
Good talking to you.
Yeah, you too.

21:50.176 --> 21:51.276
Yeah?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.643
A third body was found

21:52.678 --> 21:53.977
earlier today in St. Pete.

21:54.012 --> 21:55.811
And given the hurricane,
they were a little slow

21:55.846 --> 21:57.480
with getting me the information.

21:57.514 --> 21:58.482
Who was the Vic?

21:58.516 --> 21:59.516
A bank loan officer

21:59.550 --> 22:02.118
by the name of
Charles Kendrick, 52.

22:02.153 --> 22:03.920
Ballistics say that he was shot
with the same gun

22:03.954 --> 22:05.721
that killed the other
two victims earlier today.

22:05.756 --> 22:08.123
Time of death
puts him as first kill.

22:09.292 --> 22:10.759
Where are you?

22:10.793 --> 22:12.227
Palm Glade Class of 1990 reunion.

22:12.261 --> 22:14.430
The other two victims were
supposed to be here today.

22:14.464 --> 22:17.399
Uh-huh, well, Kendrick
was 52 and from Georgia,

22:17.433 --> 22:20.735
so he doesn't appear to have
any ties to your reunion.

22:20.769 --> 22:22.236
Yeah, not yet, anyway --
like you said,

22:22.271 --> 22:24.004
the first victim
was killed 70 miles away.

22:24.039 --> 22:25.472
The other two,
Raines and Peterson,

22:25.507 --> 22:27.141
were supposed to be here
at this reunion.

22:27.175 --> 22:29.109
I mean, this guy is killing
in a freakin' hurricane.

22:29.144 --> 22:32.012
I need to find out how those two
were targeted by the same killer

22:32.046 --> 22:34.681
and why, if we got any chance
of stopping this spree.

22:34.715 --> 22:35.948
Okay, well,
how are you gonna get

22:35.983 --> 22:37.182
these people to open up to you?

22:37.217 --> 22:38.817
I'm not. Bill is.

22:38.851 --> 22:40.185
Who the hell is Bill?

22:40.219 --> 22:41.686
I have no idea.

22:43.289 --> 22:44.888
I got to go.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.094
Can I help you with something?

22:57.128 --> 23:01.096
Smelled smoke.
Looking for the fire.

23:01.131 --> 23:03.265
What are you, some kind
of Fire Marshal?

23:03.299 --> 23:05.066
When did you take up smoking?

23:05.101 --> 23:07.868
What's it to you?

23:07.903 --> 23:10.670
You were on the
football team, right?

23:10.704 --> 23:12.272
I <i>was</i>
<i>the football team.</i>

23:12.306 --> 23:13.939
That's funny.

23:13.974 --> 23:16.175
Yeah, no, that's
what confuses me.

23:16.209 --> 23:18.644
You know, a lot of former
athletes don't take up smoking.

23:18.678 --> 23:20.946
I mean, alcohol, maybe.

23:20.980 --> 23:23.814
A little wife-beating
on the side, no?

23:23.849 --> 23:24.949
But smoking?

23:24.983 --> 23:26.517
Unless of course for some reason

23:26.551 --> 23:28.051
their lives have turned to shit

23:28.085 --> 23:29.619
and have lost the reason to live,

23:29.653 --> 23:31.053
that one really throws me.

23:31.087 --> 23:34.490
So, what are you doing now?

23:34.524 --> 23:37.326
Why is it reunions
are all about what you do?

23:37.360 --> 23:39.660
"What do you drive?"
"How big's your house?"

23:39.695 --> 23:41.329
"How much do you make?"

23:41.363 --> 23:43.463
Well, 'cause if you'd made
something of yourself,

23:43.498 --> 23:44.931
you want to rub it in the face

23:44.965 --> 23:46.732
of people that you used
to care about,

23:46.767 --> 23:49.501
people like Dennis Peterson
and Valerie Raines.

23:49.536 --> 23:52.904
I deliver bottled water
to rich, lazy asswipes

23:52.938 --> 23:54.338
too good to drink from the tap.

23:54.372 --> 23:56.373
And I don't care who knows it.

23:56.407 --> 23:57.907
Well, that is noble.

23:57.941 --> 24:00.176
You know the party's
upstairs, right?

24:00.211 --> 24:02.880
I mean, we didn't really know
each other well back then,

24:02.914 --> 24:05.683
but why'd you come if you didn't
intend to have fun with us?

24:05.718 --> 24:07.885
Maybe I just wanted to see
what gigantic jackasses

24:07.920 --> 24:10.988
everybody turned out to be.

24:14.259 --> 24:16.460
How are you doing, Evelyn?

24:16.494 --> 24:20.531
Ohh.
Embarrassed beyond belief.

24:20.565 --> 24:23.100
When I fell and cracked my hip,

24:23.134 --> 24:25.936
my mind must have cracked, too.

24:25.971 --> 24:28.038
Your mind is fine.

24:28.072 --> 24:32.542
At my age, I should be throwing
caution to the wind.

24:32.577 --> 24:34.911
Instead, I get delusional

24:34.945 --> 24:39.349
about doctors pulling the plug
on me for bed space.

24:39.383 --> 24:40.583
That's the death panel,

24:40.618 --> 24:42.785
and it hasn't been
commissioned yet.

24:42.820 --> 24:46.121
And no one is pulling the plug
on you on my watch.

24:46.156 --> 24:48.457
You missed your calling.

24:48.492 --> 24:49.758
What do you mean?

24:49.793 --> 24:51.260
Medical Examiner?

24:51.294 --> 24:52.327
Mm-hmm.

24:52.361 --> 24:53.795
It's noble...

24:53.829 --> 24:56.833
And someone's got to do it.

24:56.867 --> 25:00.537
But with your bedside manner...

25:00.571 --> 25:03.606
The living could really use
a guy like you.

25:05.142 --> 25:07.243
You know, maybe if
all my patients were like you,

25:07.277 --> 25:09.245
I might have taken
a different career path.

25:09.279 --> 25:11.080
You remind me of my husband.

25:11.114 --> 25:13.249
He had a gruff exterior, too,

25:13.283 --> 25:17.953
but inside, he was a very kind man.

25:17.987 --> 25:21.823
He'd do anything for me.

25:21.858 --> 25:24.593
I was a very lucky woman.

25:24.627 --> 25:27.329
You know what, Evelyn?

25:27.363 --> 25:29.364
He was a very lucky man.

25:33.369 --> 25:35.103
Evelyn?

25:35.137 --> 25:36.571
Evelyn?

25:36.606 --> 25:37.939
Evelyn?

25:40.577 --> 25:42.378
Uh, code. Code -- code --
c-coding!

25:42.412 --> 25:44.047
Patient here!

25:46.751 --> 25:49.186
I need a bag-mask tube and a ventilator.
Got it.

25:49.220 --> 25:50.486
Come on, you remember this.

25:50.520 --> 25:54.288
Evelyn, I'm doing my best.
Now you do yours. Come on.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.229
All right, it's in.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.667
In? Okay.
Got it.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.370
All right.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.572
Got it?

26:18.476 --> 26:20.510
Okay.

26:21.645 --> 26:23.345
Okay.

26:23.380 --> 26:25.814
She's back.

26:28.450 --> 26:29.883
Give me the ventilator.

26:29.917 --> 26:32.852
Ventilator.

26:34.588 --> 26:37.323
All right.

26:37.357 --> 26:38.656
Good work, doctor.

26:38.691 --> 26:40.591
You're kidding me.

26:40.626 --> 26:42.626
When does the backup generator
kick in?

26:42.660 --> 26:44.596
That <i>was the backup generator.</i>
<i>Great.</i>

26:45.564 --> 26:46.897
Okay, you got this?
Yeah.

26:46.931 --> 26:49.066
Do you got this?
Yeah.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.968
I'll be right back.
Wait -- wait, Carlos. Where are you going?

26:51.002 --> 26:53.040
Just keep going, keep going.
Carlos?

26:53.075 --> 26:56.076
Don't worry about it. Just --
just keep going! Keep going!

26:57.445 --> 26:59.279
It's gonna be okay.

27:07.007 --> 27:10.108
Go, go, go! Come on!
I need that ready to roll!

27:10.142 --> 27:11.909
Excuse me.
UN-freakin'-believable!

27:11.943 --> 27:14.344
All right, I need those
evacuation routes posted!

27:14.379 --> 27:17.681
I need the purification systems
loaded and ready to go in 10!

27:17.715 --> 27:19.950
What the hell are you waiting for?!

27:19.985 --> 27:21.218
What?!

27:21.253 --> 27:22.186
Hi.

27:22.220 --> 27:23.754
No!

27:23.788 --> 27:25.155
I-I'm Carlos Sanchez,

27:25.190 --> 27:27.124
Chief Medical Examiner
with the FDLE.

27:27.158 --> 27:28.525
Someone die?

27:28.559 --> 27:30.694
A lot of people will unless I can get a generator.
Excuse me?

27:30.729 --> 27:32.664
Palm Glade's Hospital's
backup generators went out.

27:32.698 --> 27:34.933
I understand you have four.
I'm here to requisition one.

27:34.967 --> 27:37.069
I haven't got one to spare.

27:37.103 --> 27:39.005
You have four.

27:39.039 --> 27:41.507
Those generators are already
loaded on trucks

27:41.542 --> 27:44.411
and are designated for spots
in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.

27:44.445 --> 27:46.847
Those trucks are gonna roll
as soon as the winds die down.

27:46.881 --> 27:48.916
Are you kidding me?
Listen, I'll call around

27:48.950 --> 27:50.551
and see if I can find you one.

27:50.585 --> 27:53.988
But I'm not making any promises.

28:00.995 --> 28:03.830
Time to earn your intern stripes.

28:03.865 --> 28:06.066
Don't you have a hurricane
to worry about?

28:06.100 --> 28:07.700
I have two
state of the emergencies,

28:07.735 --> 28:09.934
and you're smack dab
in the middle of one of them.

28:09.969 --> 28:11.302
♪ Don't worry ♪

28:11.336 --> 28:13.369
Wait, I-is that Bobby McFerrin?

28:13.404 --> 28:15.003
Yeah, irony,
because of the hurricane.

28:15.037 --> 28:16.170
No, no, no, no.

28:16.204 --> 28:18.470
You have a very dangerous
armed man on the loose.

28:18.505 --> 28:20.605
Don't be happy. Worry.

28:20.639 --> 28:22.907
After you've been shot in the ass,
you never let your guard down.

28:22.941 --> 28:24.342
I'm all over it.

28:24.376 --> 28:27.277
Yeah, it turns out Peterson was
quite the silver-tongued devil.

28:27.311 --> 28:29.513
Reunions make people reflect.

28:29.547 --> 28:32.181
Maybe someone reflected
on the girl that got away.

28:32.215 --> 28:33.981
Maybe that someone
blamed Peterson.

28:34.015 --> 28:36.916
Listen to me. The shooter
already killed three.

28:36.950 --> 28:38.384
Don't become number four.

28:38.418 --> 28:40.052
Are you ordering me
not to get shot?

28:40.086 --> 28:42.688
Look, this guy will not
hesitate to shoot you.

28:42.722 --> 28:43.889
Yes...

28:43.923 --> 28:46.023
I'm ordering you not to get shot.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.392
♪ ...No place to lay your head ♪

28:51.861 --> 28:53.428
Sir?

28:53.462 --> 28:55.429
I'm still trying to track down
another generator.

28:55.464 --> 28:56.864
Listen, I know
you're doing your best.

28:56.899 --> 28:58.133
And I know what it feels like

28:58.168 --> 28:59.536
to be pulled in a lot of directions,

28:59.570 --> 29:01.339
people making outrageous demands.

29:01.373 --> 29:02.940
You have no idea.

29:02.974 --> 29:05.208
No, actually, I do.
More than you know.

29:05.243 --> 29:07.243
You see, I work with this guy
in homicide.

29:07.277 --> 29:09.178
He acts like the world
revolves around him.

29:12.249 --> 29:15.151
Drove his last partner
to cut off his wife's head.

29:15.185 --> 29:17.053
Seriously?
Yeah.

29:17.087 --> 29:20.089
Actually, I pulled
the wife's jawbone

29:20.123 --> 29:21.457
out of the gator's stomach.

29:21.491 --> 29:22.892
Get out.

29:22.926 --> 29:24.427
Yeah, partially digested.

29:24.461 --> 29:26.562
They have a very slow
metabolism.

29:26.597 --> 29:28.931
Then what happened?

29:28.966 --> 29:32.501
We caught the guy.
He's in jail. Got to go.

29:36.872 --> 29:40.310
Smooth move!

29:40.344 --> 29:41.510
This is so cool!

29:41.545 --> 29:43.746
I've never stolen anything before.

29:43.780 --> 29:45.180
It's not stealing.
It's requisitioning.

29:45.215 --> 29:46.649
Who authorized us to do this?

29:46.683 --> 29:48.884
A category-4 hurricane.

29:57.360 --> 30:01.430
♪ Caught up in the moment ♪

30:01.464 --> 30:02.998
Bill?

30:03.032 --> 30:04.066
Hey...

30:04.100 --> 30:05.734
Stephanie.
Hang on.

30:07.737 --> 30:10.072
Ohh. Ah.

30:10.107 --> 30:11.173
Thank you.

30:11.208 --> 30:12.708
Geez, man, come on.

30:12.743 --> 30:15.479
Oh, hey, sorry.
You know. Women. Huh.
Bill?

30:15.513 --> 30:16.513
Yeah.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.015
You're not Billy.

30:18.049 --> 30:19.549
This guy thinks he's Billy.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.416
What the hell's going on?
I know Bill.

30:21.450 --> 30:23.217
He's my friend.
He e-mailed me.

30:23.252 --> 30:25.986
He couldn't make it.
You are not Billy.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.354
Who the hell are you?

30:27.388 --> 30:28.855
Well, yeah, I'm not Bill Taylor.

30:28.890 --> 30:30.390
But, you know what?
Look down.

30:30.425 --> 30:32.459
I need to talk to you.

30:34.528 --> 30:35.528
Okay.

30:35.563 --> 30:37.798
Lead on.

30:37.832 --> 30:40.033
In here.

30:43.204 --> 30:44.972
Okay, what's your problem?

30:45.006 --> 30:46.740
Dennis Peterson was killed today,

30:46.774 --> 30:47.874
along with Valerie Raines

30:47.908 --> 30:49.374
and a loan officer from St. Pete.

30:49.409 --> 30:50.608
What?

30:50.642 --> 30:52.342
Star quarterback and cheerleader.

30:52.376 --> 30:54.143
You and Becky made
a lovely couple...

30:54.178 --> 30:56.046
That is, until Peterson
moved in.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.614
Yeah, and I dumped Becky.

30:57.648 --> 30:59.149
Yeah. Regrets?

30:59.184 --> 31:00.317
I was the star quarterback.

31:00.351 --> 31:01.885
I could have had any girl I wanted.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.286
Yeah, that was then.
This is now.

31:03.321 --> 31:05.021
What, Becky the one
that got away?

31:05.056 --> 31:06.389
No.

31:06.424 --> 31:08.190
Peterson had sex
with your girlfriend

31:08.225 --> 31:10.391
and then went on to achieve
a great many things,

31:10.425 --> 31:12.290
like being one of those
"rich, lazy asswipes

31:12.325 --> 31:14.291
who gets their water
delivered to them by losers.

31:14.326 --> 31:16.560
I'm no loser, pal.
After you came back from the hotel,

31:16.594 --> 31:17.861
all three victims were already dead.

31:17.896 --> 31:19.029
You had time to kill them all.

31:19.063 --> 31:20.063
But I didn't.

31:20.097 --> 31:21.531
I was going home,
the roads were jammed.

31:21.565 --> 31:24.567
Or you were trying
to establish an alibi.

31:24.601 --> 31:27.703
I didn't kill anybody.
This is the guy.

31:27.737 --> 31:28.870
Okay,
once the weather breaks,

31:28.905 --> 31:30.405
an FHP unit will be here
to pick you up.

31:30.439 --> 31:32.173
Don't let him smoke.
You're arresting me?

31:32.207 --> 31:34.074
Well, we're not
escorting you home!

31:34.108 --> 31:36.509
Oh, man.

31:39.579 --> 31:40.879
What did you do?!

31:40.914 --> 31:42.414
I got us a generator.

31:42.448 --> 31:44.082
FEMA called.
They said you stole it?!

31:44.116 --> 31:45.183
Requisitioned it.

31:45.217 --> 31:47.318
I did not authorize this.
Who cares?!

31:47.352 --> 31:49.486
Plugging this generator in
puts this hospital at risk

31:49.521 --> 31:51.321
for criminal penalties and fines.

31:51.355 --> 31:53.322
I could be an accessory
after the fact!

31:53.357 --> 31:55.490
If I don't plug it in,
people are gonna die!

31:55.525 --> 31:57.392
I will not let you
put this hospital at risk!

31:57.427 --> 31:58.493
And the people inside?
Huh?

31:58.528 --> 32:00.228
You're okay
putting <i>them</i> at risk?

32:02.931 --> 32:04.665
Get out of my way.

32:04.699 --> 32:06.066
Now.

32:12.343 --> 32:14.846
That was awesome.

32:15.882 --> 32:18.618
Yeah, it was.

32:33.534 --> 32:36.337
You...Owe me a dance.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.206
Uh, yes, I do.

32:40.909 --> 32:42.876
Ha ha!
I knew you weren't Bill.

32:42.911 --> 32:43.944
Why'd you keep my secret?

32:43.978 --> 32:45.145
Because you were cute

32:45.180 --> 32:46.480
and I wanted a dance.

32:46.514 --> 32:48.750
And, you know, High School
wasn't all that fun,

32:48.784 --> 32:50.452
so I thought I'd spice it up a bit.

32:50.486 --> 32:52.421
Hey, can I ask you a question?

32:52.455 --> 32:53.556
Yeah.

32:53.590 --> 32:55.191
Did Dennis Peterson
and Valerie Raines

32:55.225 --> 32:57.160
have anything to do with
each other in High School?

32:57.194 --> 32:58.995
No.
Are you sure?

32:59.030 --> 33:01.865
Yeah, I'm sure.
Valerie was not pretty.

33:01.899 --> 33:04.634
And Dennis was always out
chasing hot chicks.

33:04.669 --> 33:06.170
Yeah, is that fact or fiction?

33:06.204 --> 33:07.872
That is a fact.

33:07.906 --> 33:10.541
He could have any girl he wanted
in High School.

33:10.575 --> 33:11.776
Even the Homecoming Queen?

33:11.810 --> 33:14.512
Actually, no,
not the Homecoming Queen.

33:14.546 --> 33:16.914
Any girl but Tanya Owens.

33:16.949 --> 33:18.282
Come with me.

33:22.319 --> 33:23.485
You see, Tommy and Tanya

33:23.519 --> 33:25.284
were together since sophomore
year in High School.

33:25.318 --> 33:27.282
Yeah, but Dennis didn't worry
about relationships.

33:27.316 --> 33:28.448
Look at Eddie and Becky.

33:28.482 --> 33:30.380
Yeah, but Eddie and Becky
weren't that serious.

33:30.415 --> 33:31.948
Tommy and Tanya --
they were a thing.

33:31.982 --> 33:34.183
And, you know, Dennis --
he was not the marrying type.

33:34.217 --> 33:35.651
And Tommy was?

33:35.686 --> 33:37.886
They were married right out of High School.
They had a baby.

33:37.921 --> 33:39.021
How are they going?

33:39.055 --> 33:40.422
Oh, I heard they hit
some hard times.

33:40.457 --> 33:42.491
Tommy had some medical issues.
He lost his job.

33:42.525 --> 33:45.660
And I think
they're headed for divorce.

33:47.896 --> 33:49.263
Yeah?

33:49.297 --> 33:50.497
What I'm about to tell you

33:50.532 --> 33:52.566
is confidential
doctor/patient information.

33:52.600 --> 33:53.900
Thank you.

33:53.934 --> 33:55.268
Okay.

33:55.302 --> 33:57.570
And only because you're
dealing with a spree killing,

33:57.605 --> 33:59.038
which qualifies as an imminent threat,

33:59.072 --> 34:01.573
am I disclosing this information.

34:01.608 --> 34:03.675
Dennis Peterson
was donating bone marrow

34:03.709 --> 34:05.009
to a 20-year-old boy.

34:05.044 --> 34:06.244
And his connection to the boy?

34:06.278 --> 34:08.379
It's his illegitimate son.

34:08.413 --> 34:10.714
The boy's last name
wasn't Owens, was it?

34:10.748 --> 34:12.748
How'd you know that?

34:19.357 --> 34:22.324
'Cause his father Tommy's
the shooter.

34:26.264 --> 34:27.697
Mm.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.237
My patients don't
usually open their eyes

34:35.272 --> 34:36.739
after I've done my work.

34:38.108 --> 34:40.342
They don't know
what they're missing.

34:42.512 --> 34:43.779
You feeling all right?

34:43.813 --> 34:45.848
I'm fine. Mm-hmm.

34:45.882 --> 34:49.051
But you deprived the hospital

34:49.085 --> 34:50.987
of an empty bed.

34:52.022 --> 34:54.556
I told you --
not on my watch.

34:54.591 --> 34:56.324
Mm-hmm.

34:59.429 --> 35:01.329
It's okay.

35:04.567 --> 35:06.668
Your confidential hospital
informant played a crucial role.

35:06.702 --> 35:09.337
Come on. Let's go.
One, two, three. Go, go, go!

35:09.371 --> 35:10.872
Thank that person for me.

35:10.906 --> 35:13.341
Tommy Owens was recently laid
off where Valerie Raines works.

35:13.375 --> 35:14.676
Let's go. Come on.

35:14.710 --> 35:16.478
He also was turned down
for a loan

35:16.512 --> 35:18.746
at the bank where
the loan officer was killed.

35:18.781 --> 35:20.682
Any medical issues?

35:20.716 --> 35:22.417
Yeah, he suffers
from bipolar disorder.

35:22.451 --> 35:24.586
He was getting electroconvulsive
therapy treatment

35:24.620 --> 35:25.820
and medication.

35:25.854 --> 35:29.291
But his insurance ran out
when he lost his job.

35:29.325 --> 35:31.327
Finding out his son
wasn't his biological son,

35:31.361 --> 35:32.962
losing his job,
getting a divorce,

35:32.996 --> 35:34.496
being turned down for a loan.

35:34.530 --> 35:36.598
Yeah, it was too much to handle
all at once.

35:36.632 --> 35:39.066
Yeah, perfect storm
of emotional blows.

35:39.100 --> 35:41.435
Yep, and now
we've got to stop him.

35:41.469 --> 35:43.637
Well, in a killing spree,
usually the last victim

35:43.671 --> 35:45.538
is the person that
the shooter perceives

35:45.572 --> 35:47.039
is letting them down the most.

35:47.073 --> 35:48.807
Yeah, well, learning 20 years later

35:48.841 --> 35:51.208
that Tanya Owens gave birth
to another man's son --

35:51.242 --> 35:53.576
I think that would probably
qualify her for that honor.

35:53.611 --> 35:54.644
Yeah.
You called her already?

35:54.678 --> 35:56.078
I'm putting together
S.W.A.T. teams to send

35:56.113 --> 35:58.280
both to Tanya's house
and Tommy Owens' apartment.

35:58.314 --> 35:59.682
I'm heading there now.

35:59.716 --> 36:01.850
Uh, Tommy Owens' medical file.

36:01.885 --> 36:03.151
Oh, thank you.

36:03.186 --> 36:04.519
I'm thinking the ex
is the last victim.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.054
Want to head over there
and try and stop it.

36:06.088 --> 36:08.590
You really think she's the last?

36:10.259 --> 36:12.894
You're <i>so</i> not listening
to me.

36:12.928 --> 36:14.295
Okay. Bye.

36:14.329 --> 36:17.398
Wait, what? Sorry?
Uh, thank you.

36:17.433 --> 36:18.633
Be careful.

36:18.667 --> 36:20.035
Yeah.

36:58.608 --> 37:01.977
What's that noise?

37:03.312 --> 37:06.247
Remember me?

37:06.282 --> 37:09.083
What are you doing here?

37:09.117 --> 37:10.718
I asked you a question.

37:10.752 --> 37:13.355
Yes.

37:13.390 --> 37:16.360
You're Mr. Owens.
What do you want?

37:17.128 --> 37:18.095
There.

37:18.129 --> 37:19.797
What do you want?
What do you want?

37:19.831 --> 37:23.233
Nothing. I just came here
to kill you, that's all.

37:23.268 --> 37:25.068
No, no, no. Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait!

37:25.103 --> 37:26.904
Please, please, please.
I'll do anything. No, please.

37:26.938 --> 37:28.438
Too late.
Oh, please, please, please.

37:28.473 --> 37:30.240
I'm begging you.
It's not too late! Please!

37:30.275 --> 37:32.309
Say again?
Please, I'm begging you. I'll do anything.

37:32.343 --> 37:34.077
No, please!
Oh, now you're begging me?

37:34.112 --> 37:36.980
No! Please don't kill me! Please!
It's too late!

37:37.015 --> 37:38.715
No, no!
Please, please don't kill me!

37:39.817 --> 37:43.386
Hey. Wow.
She really let you down, huh?

37:43.421 --> 37:45.789
I'm unarmed. Look.

37:45.823 --> 37:47.557
I got nothing, see?

37:47.592 --> 37:49.459
Unarmed.

37:49.493 --> 37:51.194
I mean, they all let you down,
didn't they?

37:51.228 --> 37:53.262
Valerie Raines fired you.

37:53.296 --> 37:55.830
Charles Kendrick
wouldn't give you a loan.

37:55.865 --> 37:57.065
Worst of all, Dennis Peterson

37:57.099 --> 37:58.700
had sex with
your childhood sweetheart.

37:58.734 --> 38:01.035
You've been raising the child as your own,
not knowing the truth.

38:01.069 --> 38:03.804
But you were dealing with it,
or trying to,

38:03.838 --> 38:06.673
until Carol cut off your lifeline --

38:06.707 --> 38:09.509
the meds that were helping you
keep it all in perspective.

38:10.678 --> 38:12.612
Yeah, oh, you were right,
by the way.

38:12.647 --> 38:13.848
The storm got a lot worse.

38:13.882 --> 38:15.851
And that's gonna end today!

38:15.885 --> 38:17.052
Hey, hey, hey!
I understand.

38:17.087 --> 38:18.721
I understand you want to kill Carol.

38:18.755 --> 38:20.689
My own partner just about did it
two hours ago.

38:20.723 --> 38:22.257
I mean, she is the worst
of the worst.

38:22.292 --> 38:24.660
Typical bureaucrat
from the party of "no."

38:24.694 --> 38:26.662
She lives to say "no," you know?
You need help? "No."

38:26.697 --> 38:28.198
Need medication
to keep you sane,

38:28.232 --> 38:29.733
keep the demons
from your door?

38:29.767 --> 38:30.935
"No."

38:30.969 --> 38:32.269
What she doesn't understand

38:32.304 --> 38:34.172
is that saying "no"
doesn't make her important.

38:34.206 --> 38:35.640
It just makes her
a pain in the ass.

38:35.674 --> 38:38.641
In fact, you know what?
Seriously, shoot her.

38:38.676 --> 38:40.941
I don't care.
One for every "no."

38:40.976 --> 38:42.842
Hope you've got a full magazine.
Yeah.

38:42.877 --> 38:44.377
Or, Tommy, you can have this.

38:44.411 --> 38:46.746
It's your medication, right?

38:46.780 --> 38:48.380
Medication that
you couldn't get anymore

38:48.415 --> 38:49.848
'cause your insurance ran out.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.118
Here, I want you to have it.

38:55.854 --> 38:57.788
Ugh!

39:01.426 --> 39:02.759
That's it, Tommy.

39:02.793 --> 39:05.227
It's over.

39:13.602 --> 39:15.803
You gave me
a damn heart attack.

39:15.837 --> 39:17.605
What? I was just following orders.

39:17.639 --> 39:19.339
I didn't get shot, did I?

39:19.374 --> 39:21.574
Yeah, this time.

39:21.609 --> 39:24.777
Excuse me, Detective. I just
wanted to say thank you.

39:24.812 --> 39:26.044
Oh, you're welcome.

39:26.079 --> 39:27.512
My goodness,
you were convincing.

39:27.546 --> 39:29.880
I actually thought you wanted
that man to shoot me.

39:34.519 --> 39:37.253
I mean, you weren't really
going to let him shoot me.

39:37.287 --> 39:39.088
You know what?

39:39.122 --> 39:42.357
You should think about
how you treat people.

39:57.906 --> 40:00.640
Is there a Hernandez family
on this block?

40:00.675 --> 40:03.076
No, they're a couple of blocks over.

40:03.110 --> 40:05.210
There's mail in here.

40:05.245 --> 40:06.979
Oh, I'll take it to them!

40:07.013 --> 40:08.814
I'm gonna check up
on Kyle and Rickie,

40:08.848 --> 40:10.416
see how they made it
through the hurricane!

40:10.450 --> 40:12.217
Okay, but come right back!
I will!

40:12.251 --> 40:15.120
Wow. I thought it was
just Carlos being Carlos.

40:15.154 --> 40:17.888
Things actually do fly in
from all over the place, huh?

40:17.923 --> 40:20.090
Yeah, things could travel
from miles away

40:20.124 --> 40:21.958
just to end up in my front yard.

40:21.993 --> 40:23.593
Yeah.
I know how that feels.

40:26.963 --> 40:28.263
Ray called.

40:28.298 --> 40:30.366
He wanted to see how we were
doing during the storm.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.502
Oh, that was nice of him.

40:33.536 --> 40:34.803
You, uh --

40:34.838 --> 40:37.139
you guys talk about much
on the phone?

40:37.173 --> 40:40.375
Oh, I just got off really quickly.

40:40.410 --> 40:42.110
He only has a few minutes,

40:42.145 --> 40:44.980
and I wanted him
to talk to Jeff, so...

40:45.014 --> 40:46.748
Right.

40:49.085 --> 40:50.485
This looks like a two-person job.

40:50.520 --> 40:52.287
I'll take the heavy end,
you take the light end.

40:52.322 --> 40:55.224
Uh, which one's
the lighter end?

40:55.259 --> 40:57.294
Oh, that one.
This one?

40:57.328 --> 40:59.429
No, that's the lighter end.

40:59.463 --> 41:00.964
You think?

41:00.999 --> 41:03.700
Oh, you're trying to get out
of hauling the heavier end.

41:03.735 --> 41:06.103
H-hey -- hey, you know what?
Be my guest.

41:06.137 --> 41:08.705
Great. I will.
Please.

41:08.740 --> 41:10.007
The lighter end.

41:10.041 --> 41:12.209
Right. I'll go to the heavy end.

41:12.243 --> 41:13.643
Here, ready?
Uh-huh.

41:13.678 --> 41:15.312
One, two, three!
One, two, three!

41:15.346 --> 41:17.581
Okay.
Oh!

41:17.615 --> 41:18.882
Wow.

41:18.917 --> 41:20.017
I was wrong.

41:20.051 --> 41:21.451
That must be embarrassing.

41:21.486 --> 41:22.653
It's a little embarrassing.

41:22.687 --> 41:24.654
You want to -- I'll -- could we --
thank you.

41:24.689 --> 41:26.656
Why don't you take the heavy end?
Okay.

41:26.691 --> 41:29.293
Here, ready?
Watch your back.

41:29.327 --> 41:32.096
I'm watching my back.
You just watch your back.

41:32.130 --> 41:33.597
Oh, I'm always
watching my back.

41:33.631 --> 41:35.198
Use your legs.

41:35.233 --> 41:36.433
You have a lot of advice

41:36.467 --> 41:38.568
for someone who's never
picked up after a hurricane.

41:38.603 --> 41:40.170
Yeah, I know --
can you imagine

41:40.205 --> 41:42.940
how obnoxious I'm gonna be after
I live through a few of these?
