31:19.248 --> 31:21.050
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

31:21.050 --> 31:22.351
WELL, NOT FOR YOU, MAYBE.

31:22.351 --> 31:25.054
BUT SEE, I CAN'T AFFORD
TO KEEP THAT PLACE.

31:25.054 --> 31:28.157
I MEAN, LOOK,
MY WIFE WALKED OUT

31:28.157 --> 31:30.289
ON ME AND MY BOYS
YEARS AGO.

31:30.289 --> 31:33.092
SHE SHOWS UP LAST MONTH
ASKING FOR A DIVORCE

31:33.092 --> 31:36.225
AND HALF OF EVERYTHING
I OWN.

31:36.225 --> 31:40.429
NOT EVEN A MENTION OF A HELLO
TO HER OWN CHILDREN.

31:40.429 --> 31:42.131
I'M SORRY.

31:42.131 --> 31:46.075
SO IT'S EITHER THE HOUSE
OR THE BAR.

31:46.075 --> 31:50.179
NOW IF--IF YOU PULL OUT
OF THE DEAL,

31:50.179 --> 31:52.441
I'M GONNA HAVE TO COME CLEAN
WITH MY BOYS

31:52.441 --> 31:54.113
AND TELL 'EM
THAT THEIR OWN MOTHER

31:54.113 --> 31:56.645
DON'T GIVE ONE DAMN
ABOUT THEM.

31:56.645 --> 31:58.547
YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING?

31:58.547 --> 32:00.389
YEAH.

32:00.389 --> 32:02.391
I DO.

32:02.391 --> 32:05.394
♪♪♪

32:06.925 --> 32:10.529
ROGER, ROGER, ROGER.

32:13.102 --> 32:15.604
YOU WERE
IN RARE FORM TONIGHT.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.568
I GET ANXIOUS
AT SOCIAL FUNCTIONS.

32:19.568 --> 32:23.142
SOCIAL ANXIETY...

32:23.142 --> 32:24.673
IS THAT WHY YOU REQUESTED

32:24.673 --> 32:27.316
A SEAT AWAY FROM
THE GRAYSONS' TABLE?

32:28.577 --> 32:32.051
NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED
TO SUFFER MY COMPANY.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.522
I'M SURPRISED
I WAS EVEN INVITED.

32:33.522 --> 32:35.054
MUST HAVE BEEN AN OVERSIGHT.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.325
OH, NO.

32:36.325 --> 32:38.027
WE WANTED YOU HERE.

32:41.190 --> 32:42.161
(sets glass down)

32:42.161 --> 32:44.063
YOU KNOW,
THE GRAYSONS RECEIVED

32:44.063 --> 32:46.295
A DISTURBING NOTE.

32:46.295 --> 32:49.698
WHAT'D YOU HOPE TO GAIN
BY SENDING THIS?

32:56.375 --> 32:58.177
WHY WOULD I SEND THIS?

32:58.177 --> 32:59.308
BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY

32:59.308 --> 33:01.310
AND YOU'RE TOO SCARED
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

33:01.310 --> 33:03.452
BECAUSE THE NOTE'S
A WAY TO PROJECT BLAME,

33:03.452 --> 33:05.284
MAKE YOURSELF
FEEL LESS CULPABLE

33:05.284 --> 33:07.686
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
TO DAVID CLARKE.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.719
(knock on door)

33:19.328 --> 33:21.570
I JUST BROUGHT
MR. HALSTED SOME ASPIRIN.

33:21.570 --> 33:24.173
YOU KNOW WHAT? I-I HAVE
SOMETHING STRONGER.

33:24.173 --> 33:27.506
HE'LL SLEEP LIKE A BABY.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.478
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT. YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GET OUT THERE

33:29.478 --> 33:32.411
AND GET THE CHAMPAGNE READY.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.343
YES, SIR.

33:47.626 --> 33:48.557
(clinks)

33:48.557 --> 33:51.500
BEFORE WE CLOSE THE BOOK
ON 2002,

33:51.500 --> 33:54.203
I'D LIKE TO RAISE A GLASS

33:54.203 --> 33:57.566
TO ALL OF YOU
WHO HAVE STOOD BY OUR FAMILY

33:57.566 --> 34:00.569
HERE AT HOME
AND AT GRAYSON GLOBAL.

34:00.569 --> 34:02.271
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,

34:02.271 --> 34:04.513
OUR COMPANY HAS BEEN
LANGUISHING IN THE RED

34:04.513 --> 34:07.516
EVER SINCE THE, UM, THE TERRIBLE
INCIDENT BACK IN '93.

34:07.516 --> 34:10.478
BUT I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE

34:10.478 --> 34:13.652
THAT AFTER TEN LONG YEARS,

34:13.652 --> 34:17.255
WE'VE FINALLY FOUGHT OUR WAY
BACK TO BLACK.

34:17.255 --> 34:18.556
GRAYSON GLOBAL
IS ON TOP AGAIN,

34:18.556 --> 34:21.630
AND THAT IS WHERE
I INTEND TO KEEP US.

34:21.630 --> 34:23.692
(Mason) HEAR, HEAR.
 (cheering)

34:23.692 --> 34:27.466
AND CONTINUING WITH
THE THEME OF ONWARD AND UPWARD,

34:27.466 --> 34:31.100
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE
TO ANNOUNCE THAT

34:31.100 --> 34:32.601
MICHAEL AND LYDIA DAVIS
WILL BE SHARING

34:32.601 --> 34:34.303
OUR LITTLE STRETCH OF BEACH.

34:34.303 --> 34:36.545
AS I'VE MANAGED

34:36.545 --> 34:38.547
TO BROKER A DEAL
WITH THE TITLE HOLDERS

34:38.547 --> 34:40.649
OF THE HOUSE RIGHT NEXT DOOR,

34:40.649 --> 34:43.652
WHO AT LONG LAST WILL BE
RELINQUISHING THEIR...

34:43.652 --> 34:45.614
DEATH GRIP ON THE PROPERTY.

34:45.614 --> 34:47.516
(laughter)
 YOU'RE A MENSCH, CONRAD.

34:47.516 --> 34:49.217
WE'LL HAVE TO ARRANGE
A FINDER'S FEE.

34:49.217 --> 34:52.721
HAVING YOU AS MY NEIGHBORS
IS PAYMENT ENOUGH. THANK YOU.

34:52.721 --> 34:54.223
AW.

34:54.223 --> 34:56.225
TO A PROSPEROUS 2003.

34:56.225 --> 34:59.097
15 SECONDS TO MIDNIGHT,
EVERYONE.

ALMOST MIDNIGHT. IT'S BAD LUCK
IF I DON'T KISS SOMEBODY.

35:09.438 --> 35:12.211
OH, YOU--YOU BETTER
FIND YOUR BOYFRIEND.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.543
JACK AND I DON'T WANT
THE SAME THINGS ANYMORE.

35:14.543 --> 35:17.886
OH, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO
GET IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THAT.

35:17.886 --> 35:19.218
TOO LATE.

35:19.218 --> 35:23.252
(cheering)

35:23.252 --> 35:24.693
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?!

35:24.693 --> 35:25.694
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

OF COURSE, NEIGHBOR.

ABOUT THAT...

35:41.870 --> 35:43.242

35:43.242 --> 35:45.274
I HAVE A CONFESSION
TO MAKE.

35:45.274 --> 35:47.276
CONRAD WAS ABLE
TO BROKER THE DEAL

35:47.276 --> 35:50.179
WITH THAT OWNER FOR YOU...

35:50.179 --> 35:52.521
BECAUSE WE ARE THE OWNERS.

35:52.521 --> 35:55.384
I LIED TO YOU,
AND I'M SORRY.

35:55.384 --> 35:56.685

35:56.685 --> 35:58.387
WITH HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU
AS A FRIEND

35:58.387 --> 36:00.158
OR OUR FRIENDSHIP.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.532
IT WAS A PLACE THAT I HELD
FOR REASONS OF MY OWN.

36:03.532 --> 36:08.197
AND I CAN'T REALLY MAKE YOU
UNDERSTAND IT, BUT...

36:08.197 --> 36:11.400
(indistinct conversations
continue)

36:11.400 --> 36:15.704
(voice breaks)
THAT HOUSE WAS, UM...

36:15.704 --> 36:19.177

OF DAVID I HAD LEFT.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.311
(indistinct conversations

36:22.311 --> 36:24.713
IT'S NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND
AT ALL.

36:24.713 --> 36:28.657
TAKE THE HOUSE, LYDIA.

36:28.657 --> 36:30.719
MAKE IT YOUR OWN.

36:30.719 --> 36:33.722
NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER
THAN TO HAVE MY CLOSEST FRIEND

36:33.722 --> 36:35.564
BE MY CLOSEST NEIGHBOR.

I'LL HELP YOU. I PROMISE.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.419
IT APPEARS
WE CAN CLOSE THE CASE

38:10.419 --> 38:12.561
OF THE MYSTERY HOLIDAY CARD.

38:12.561 --> 38:14.563
FOR A MAN WITH A PENCHANT
FOR WRITING LETTERS,

38:14.563 --> 38:18.066
YOU WOULD THINK THAT ROGER
WOULD HAVE LEFT A SUICIDE NOTE.

38:18.066 --> 38:21.470
SUICIDE IS NOT
A RATIONAL ACT.

38:21.470 --> 38:23.832
I DID A COMPREHENSIVE SWEEP
OF THE ROOM.

38:23.832 --> 38:25.404
HE LEFT NOTHING BEHIND.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.476
OH, HOW CONVENIENT
FOR ALL OF US.

38:29.408 --> 38:30.709
MM.

38:36.585 --> 38:38.487
QUITE THE SOIREE.

38:38.487 --> 38:41.790
IT FEELS LIKE WE'VE BEEN CAST
IN "TEN LITTLE INDIANS."

38:41.790 --> 38:43.722
I WONDER WHO'LL BE
THE LAST TO FALL.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.824
I SUPPOSE YOU CONSIDER IT
YOUR JOB

38:45.824 --> 38:47.356
TO BREAK THIS TORRID STORY.

38:47.356 --> 38:48.797
LESS A JOB
THAN A MORAL OBLIGATION.

38:48.797 --> 38:50.058
TO QUOTE LIPPMANN,

38:50.058 --> 38:52.060
"THERE CAN BE NO HIGHER LAW
IN JOURNALISM

38:52.060 --> 38:54.603
THAN TO TELL THE TRUTH
AND TO SHAME THE DEVIL."

38:54.603 --> 38:56.405
(gasps)

38:56.405 --> 38:58.336
SHAME THE DEVIL?

38:59.468 --> 39:01.840
YOU WROTE THAT NOTE.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.512
I'M A WRITER.

39:03.512 --> 39:05.343
THOUGH THIS GRUESOME
TURN OF EVENTS

39:05.343 --> 39:07.015
WAS CERTAINLY NOT
THE INTENTION.

39:07.015 --> 39:10.519
THEN WHAT ON EARTH DID YOU
PLAN ON GAINING FROM IT?

39:11.780 --> 39:13.752
INSPIRATION.

39:13.752 --> 39:16.455
I THOUGHT I'D BEAT THE BUSHES
TO SEE IF I COULD DRUM UP

39:16.455 --> 39:19.728
SOME KIND OF FRESH INTRIGUE
FOR MY BOOK.

39:21.390 --> 39:23.862
(lowered voice)
YOU ARE DESPICABLE.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.734
GEE, THANKS.

39:25.734 --> 39:27.736
HIGH PRAISE
COMING FROM YOU.

39:33.071 --> 39:35.504
(crying) THEY FRAMED MY FATHER.

39:35.504 --> 39:37.406
YOU WERE RIGHT.

39:37.406 --> 39:38.647
You got what you wanted.

39:38.647 --> 39:39.678
IT'S WHAT HE WANTED.

39:41.810 --> 39:43.582
I MET A FRIEND OF HIS TONIGHT.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.984
He knew everything,
and he was

39:45.984 --> 39:47.486
GONNA HELP ME.

39:47.486 --> 39:48.657
(sobs)

39:48.657 --> 39:50.519
AND NOW HE'S DEAD, TOO.

39:50.519 --> 39:51.720
WHAT?

39:51.720 --> 39:53.562
AND UNLESS SOMEBODY
DOES SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

39:53.562 --> 39:55.624
THEY WILL NEVER GET
WHAT THEY DESERVE.

39:55.624 --> 39:56.595
Amanda...

39:56.595 --> 39:58.597
MORE THAN KNOWING
THE TRUTH,

39:58.597 --> 40:02.070
YOUR FATHER WANTED YOU
TO GET PAST ALL THIS.

40:02.070 --> 40:04.903
THEN WHY DID HE GIVE ME
THOSE JOURNALS?!

40:04.903 --> 40:08.577
(sobs)

40:08.577 --> 40:10.579
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
THESE PEOPLE ARE GONNA PAY.

40:10.579 --> 40:12.741
THEY'RE GONNA PAY
FOR WHAT THEY DID.

40:12.741 --> 40:15.584
YOU CANNOT
BRING THE GRAYSONS DOWN

40:15.584 --> 40:17.886
all by yourself.
You willnever

40:17.886 --> 40:19.618
GET CLOSE ENOUGH
TO EXPOSE THEM.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.050
THE HELL I WON'T!

40:22.050 --> 40:23.592
AMAN--
 (line disconnects)

40:23.592 --> 40:24.653
(dial tone drones)

40:26.054 --> 40:29.427
(crying) DAD, I'M SORRY.

40:30.959 --> 40:33.662
HELP ME.

40:33.662 --> 40:36.665
(continues crying)

40:59.087 --> 41:02.160
(buzzing)

41:02.160 --> 41:03.792
(Roger's voice) "AMANDA,

41:03.792 --> 41:06.695
"FORGIVE ME MY METHODS, BUT I
HAD TO GET YOU THIS MESSAGE

41:06.695 --> 41:08.967
"BEFORE I LOST MY NERVE.

41:08.967 --> 41:12.240
"WRITING THIS DOWN IS MY WAY
OF COMMITTING TO YOU.

HEY, BABE, YOU'RE LATE.

41:39.067 --> 41:41.630
I'M SORRY.
TRAFFIC WAS TERRIBLE.

41:42.931 --> 41:45.704
WOW. YOU LOOK STUNNING.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.205
LOOK AT YOU.

41:47.205 --> 41:48.707
YOU BETTER HURRY UP
AND CHANGE.

41:48.707 --> 41:50.739
WOULDN'T BE RIGHT FOR
THE NEW FACE OF GRAYSON GLOBAL

41:50.739 --> 41:52.841

ON NEW YEAR'S EVE.

41:52.841 --> 41:54.112

41:54.112 --> 41:55.644
RIGHT, ABOUT THAT,

41:55.644 --> 41:56.785
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE DUCK OUT EARLY

41:56.785 --> 41:58.617
AND DO SOME CELEBRATING
OF OUR OWN TONIGHT?

41:58.617 --> 42:00.819
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU'D RATHER
DO ANYTHING LESS

42:00.819 --> 42:02.691
THAN MAKE SMALL TALK
WITH MY PARENTS' FRIENDS

42:02.691 --> 42:04.793
ON NEW YEAR'S EVE.

42:06.154 --> 42:09.998
ACTUALLY,
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
