WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:03.655
<i>Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...</i>

00:03.699 --> 00:05.483
-Okay, what about Kyle?
-There's no sign of him.

00:05.527 --> 00:06.832
Did you know that your DNA

00:06.876 --> 00:08.834
is a 29.3% match
to a friend of mine's?

00:08.878 --> 00:10.793
Your nephew?
Where's Kyle?

00:10.836 --> 00:12.447
Wrong question.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.970
Jones had a sword

00:14.014 --> 00:15.145
made of alien glass.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.407
Are you saying you had a sword

00:16.451 --> 00:17.669
that recognizes DNA?

00:17.713 --> 00:19.019
Burns the crap out of anybody

00:19.062 --> 00:21.021
<i>without Jones's DNA.</i>

00:21.064 --> 00:23.066
-I don't think Max is Max.
-He's Jones.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.328
I believe you boys

00:24.372 --> 00:26.156
have something
that belongs to me.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.377
We have some work to do.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.653
<i>Get out of my head, Jones.</i>

00:44.696 --> 00:47.525
<i>Give me what I want
and I'll leave you be.</i>

00:47.569 --> 00:48.700
<i>Never.</i>

00:48.744 --> 00:50.876
You put me in a cage.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.704
How amusing.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.445
I'm quite the clever girl,
Jones.

00:54.489 --> 00:58.275
While you may have
a modicum of strength in here,

00:58.319 --> 01:01.061
out there,
you're lying in a coma.

01:01.104 --> 01:03.802
Medicine, machines,
physicians,

01:03.846 --> 01:06.370
they can't save you
from my hold.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.807
Is this the part where you
tell me you're my only way out?

01:12.768 --> 01:15.118
Show me the memory
I'm looking for

01:15.162 --> 01:16.641
and I will release you.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.774
If you don't...

01:19.731 --> 01:21.211
...you're a clever girl.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.822
And I'm a Brazilian bitch,
so I'm putting my money on

01:23.866 --> 01:25.911
me keeping you right here

01:25.955 --> 01:28.262
until my friends come
and end you.

01:31.308 --> 01:36.226
Why gamble when you can
wager on a sure thing?

01:36.270 --> 01:38.794
Exactly how is your glow stick
gonna get you free?

01:38.837 --> 01:41.840
Think of your mind
like an oil lantern.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.234
The flame can
only burn for so long.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.975
But this...

01:47.281 --> 01:51.154
I can burn longer,
stronger, brighter.

01:51.198 --> 01:54.636
And while your will
wanes and fades,

01:54.679 --> 01:58.857
mine will continue to burn
everything in its path.

02:01.991 --> 02:04.211
It's okay.

02:04.254 --> 02:06.517
Everyone eventually bends to me.

02:11.740 --> 02:14.221
Maybe.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.919
But for now, you and your sword
are stuck in the cage.

02:16.962 --> 02:20.444
Yeah. It seems like 75 years
in a cave

02:20.488 --> 02:23.404
has diminished
some of our power.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.188
Unfortunately,

02:25.232 --> 02:27.495
that just means
we need to recharge it.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.714
By killing people?

02:29.758 --> 02:32.152
Eggs and omelets, darling.

02:33.370 --> 02:34.589
I'll come back.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.460
And when I do...

02:38.332 --> 02:41.509
...I will tear
this cage apart...

02:42.771 --> 02:44.294
...along with whatever's left

02:44.338 --> 02:47.341
of your feeble little mind.

02:52.259 --> 02:55.175
alien cells
use hydrolyse component polymers

02:55.218 --> 02:57.220
to attach themselves
to host cells.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.875
<i>So, essentially,
alien DNA mimics</i>

02:59.918 --> 03:01.398
the way a virus attacks.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.183
There is no current reproduction
of the predatory cells

03:03.226 --> 03:04.619
within the subject.

03:04.662 --> 03:08.797
The handprint has remained
steady in size,

03:08.840 --> 03:10.712
<i>causing fever and swelling,</i>

03:10.755 --> 03:13.323
<i>which means that the subject
is trying its hardest</i>

03:13.367 --> 03:16.718
to fight off the invasive
effects of the contact,

03:16.761 --> 03:18.067
but it's getting nowhere.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.199
Knock, knock.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.244
Brought you, uh, caffeine

03:21.288 --> 03:22.854
and news.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.508
Jones's body
is still in the pod,

03:24.552 --> 03:26.075
which means he must have
jumped into Max's body

03:26.118 --> 03:27.511
when he healed his heart.

03:27.555 --> 03:28.425
That was three days ago.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.340
-Yeah.
-N-Noah could only stay

03:30.384 --> 03:31.776
in your body intermittently.

03:31.820 --> 03:32.864
You know, how
can Jones stay

03:32.908 --> 03:34.214
in Max's body consistently?

03:34.257 --> 03:35.867
I think it has something to do

03:35.911 --> 03:37.347
with the two astronomers' car.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.131
The ones that went
missing this morning.

03:39.175 --> 03:40.872
I heard on Sanders's
police scanner

03:40.916 --> 03:43.614
that were odd slash marks
melted into it.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.529
Jones must have found his sword
that Max buried in the desert

03:45.573 --> 03:47.531
and is now using it
to kill people

03:47.575 --> 03:49.359
in order to charge
himself back up.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.231
Yeah, but why does
he need the sword?

03:51.274 --> 03:52.884
Noah and Max seemed fine
to charge themselves up

03:52.928 --> 03:54.277
just with their hands.

03:54.321 --> 03:57.237
Well, Max said, last year,
when he held the sword,

03:57.280 --> 03:59.326
it made him feel charged
and powerful.

03:59.369 --> 04:02.242
Said he felt like
an extension of himself.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.244
Plan needs to be
to separate Jones

04:04.287 --> 04:05.680
and the sword immediately.

04:05.723 --> 04:07.595
Separating's exactly
where my brain's been, too.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.641
Do you remember
when I injected Noah

04:10.685 --> 04:12.295
with the alien inhibitor?

04:12.339 --> 04:14.732
Not only did it
stop his powers

04:14.776 --> 04:17.257
but his hold on Isobel.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.389
Please tell me you made some.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.738
I'm mixing up a batch right now.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.087
Great.

04:22.131 --> 04:24.089
Except, remember
when you injected Noah,

04:24.133 --> 04:25.874
there was that terrible
three-minute window

04:25.917 --> 04:27.963
-before it kicked in?
-Right, so...

04:28.006 --> 04:30.487
I'm gonna microdose Jones.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.185
If he tastes it, you're toast.

04:33.229 --> 04:37.233
It is not perfect,
but it could work.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.714
All I would need
is a great excuse

04:39.757 --> 04:40.845
to drink with Jones.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.412
Oh.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.458
You ask
and Gregory Manes giveth.

04:44.501 --> 04:45.415
Hmm.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.287
He's holding a fundraiser today,

04:47.330 --> 04:50.377
for Maria's medical bills, which
means you'll have cover to dose

04:50.420 --> 04:54.990
Jones under the safety of
a hundred patrons while we can

04:55.033 --> 04:56.644
find the sword.
It's risky.

04:56.687 --> 04:59.255
But it's the only chance
I see for us to stop him.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.432
Okay. One more question
remains, though.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.695
How are we gonna find Jones
to set this all in motion?

05:10.397 --> 05:12.355
â™ª Your happiness...

05:12.399 --> 05:15.532
Miss Isobel.
You look stunning today.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.839
Oh, you sweet,
simple man.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.975
So...

05:24.019 --> 05:28.328
as much as you stan me,
you can't stand Max Evans.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.461
He knows more
about that break-in

05:31.505 --> 05:33.724
at his house, don't you think?

05:33.768 --> 05:35.639
He's hiding something.

05:35.683 --> 05:39.643
God, he made you look like
a ball-less bottle of weak sauce

05:39.687 --> 05:41.341
in front of the
Roswell Regiment.

05:41.384 --> 05:44.126
Wouldn't it feel so good

05:44.169 --> 05:46.607
to drag him
in front of the sheriff

05:46.650 --> 05:49.479
and prove that
you were right?

05:49.523 --> 05:51.394
It's like you know
every thought in my head.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.484
Truthfully, your pond
is a shallow swim,

05:54.528 --> 05:58.488
but... gee,
you'd really be my hero

05:58.532 --> 06:03.972
if you and the boys in blue club
would go track down Max.

06:04.015 --> 06:05.713
Don't let him out
of your sight,

06:05.756 --> 06:08.542
and let me know
when you find him.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.465
-Looking for someone?
-Whoa. Jesus.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.467
Ah, well, before
we go all the way to the boss,

06:20.510 --> 06:22.947
uh, maybe I can help you
with something?

06:22.991 --> 06:26.081
Yeah, where's Father Linus?
He usually bakes biscochitos.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.909
Uh, he's down with the flu.

06:27.952 --> 06:31.826
Uh, y'all are stuck with
apple fritters while he's out.

06:32.609 --> 06:34.437
I haven't
seen you around, Father.

06:34.481 --> 06:37.135
Ooh. No need for formalities.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.702
You can just call me Dallas.

06:38.746 --> 06:41.879
I usually work over at
the rez, but Father Linus

06:41.923 --> 06:43.403
needed an assist, so...

06:44.578 --> 06:46.188
Oh, wait.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.624
I'm s-- You want
to grab a seat?

06:47.668 --> 06:50.148
I-I know you didn't just
come for the burnt coffee.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.237
Oh, this isn't an N.A. thing.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.109
Father Linus and I talk
about other stuff.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.372
Okay. Let's talk, then.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.330
I'm all ears.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.161
Yeah, um...

07:03.205 --> 07:06.251
I-I know that a big thing
with recovery is the evolution,

07:06.295 --> 07:08.732
but the-the timing
isn't great

07:08.776 --> 07:10.081
for these discoveries.

07:10.125 --> 07:11.909
You're wondering
if you should put

07:11.953 --> 07:13.737
this evolution on hold

07:13.781 --> 07:16.000
until your life
settles out a bit?

07:16.044 --> 07:17.524
Yeah, but is that just running?

07:18.350 --> 07:20.440
To ignore God's test

07:20.483 --> 07:22.746
is to forsake
who God wants us to be.

07:22.790 --> 07:25.183
So if you feel like
God is calling on you

07:25.227 --> 07:27.490
to do more
or be more,

07:27.534 --> 07:29.666
I think that's worth a listen.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.327
Something funny, Manes?

07:38.370 --> 07:40.590
Uh, I'm just thinking
that I escaped the desert

07:40.634 --> 07:45.465
of Afghanistan just to be killed
in one outside of Roswell.

07:45.508 --> 07:46.770
You think
I'm going to shoot you?

07:46.814 --> 07:49.381
It's not exactly
apple-picking season.

07:49.425 --> 07:52.080
I didn't bring you here to die.

07:52.123 --> 07:53.995
I brought you here

07:54.038 --> 07:56.867
because you asked me
for the truth about Kyle.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.227
I think it's time we talk.

08:12.535 --> 08:15.059
Don't give me that look, Lucky.

08:15.103 --> 08:17.148
I just need one more volunteer,
and then I can break through

08:17.192 --> 08:18.889
that troublesome woman's mind.

08:20.978 --> 08:23.981
No, I don't need your luck
today, boy.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.896
This time I'll make my own.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.522
I don't know what I hit.

08:42.565 --> 08:46.526
Well, you just bumped
into a little bit of fate.

08:47.614 --> 08:51.226
Got everything you need
to make things right.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.846
Tow truck's coming, old-timer.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.762
What brings you out here, Pete?

09:05.806 --> 09:07.851
When you missed shifts,
we got worried.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.853
Turned your cruiser's
transponder on

09:09.897 --> 09:12.421
and figured I'd make sure
my buddy was A-okay.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.555
And that,
that's the sheriff.

09:16.686 --> 09:18.819
And if I'm being honest, Evans,

09:18.862 --> 09:20.603
she's a bit mad you haven't
answered any of your radio calls

09:20.647 --> 09:22.344
for the last 18 hours.

09:28.002 --> 09:31.048
Well, my little boy in blue
found Jones.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.573
Time to keep one another
from getting killed.

09:35.662 --> 09:38.969
Should be a hell
of a fundraiser.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.063
So did you do this
to him or not?

09:46.107 --> 09:48.457
If I wanted either of you dead,
you would be.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.633
So you can keep
accusing me of things,

09:50.677 --> 09:52.983
or you can let me tell you
what happened two nights ago.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.898
Got for it.

09:56.421 --> 10:00.164
As you know, Kyle triggered
the SOS from his father's radio.

10:00.208 --> 10:03.341
<i>I tracked the origin
of the signal to a home</i>

10:03.385 --> 10:04.734
<i>owned by Max Evans.</i>

10:04.778 --> 10:07.302
There, I found three men
in alien masks

10:07.345 --> 10:10.914
transferring items from a hole
in the desert into their car.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.047
Is that where you got the cut?
Trying to stop them?

10:14.091 --> 10:15.919
I had a choice.

10:15.963 --> 10:20.881
Try to follow them as they fled
or find my nephew.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.366
<i>All right, let's just say</i>

10:28.410 --> 10:29.759
that this is all
on the level.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.631
Why wouldn't you tell me this
last night?

10:31.674 --> 10:33.633
I couldn't discuss it
at Deep Sky.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.025
I was afraid the integrity

10:35.069 --> 10:36.853
of what we do there
had been compromised.

10:36.897 --> 10:39.813
Kyle was injected
with a drug so complex

10:39.856 --> 10:41.771
only a handful of people
could have fabricated it.

10:41.815 --> 10:44.121
I had to shore up
that my fears were just that.

10:44.165 --> 10:45.993
What I don't get
is why you think

10:46.036 --> 10:47.472
that somebody
from your organization

10:47.516 --> 10:49.126
would target Kyle or Maria.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.128
All I can think of

10:51.172 --> 10:53.304
is it has to do with Max Evans.

10:53.348 --> 10:54.566
Why would someone target Max?

10:54.610 --> 10:56.873
You need me to say it out loud?

10:56.917 --> 10:58.353
Fine.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.660
The events of the other night
had to do with aliens.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.142
I think it's time we talk
about the Lockhart Machine

11:05.186 --> 11:06.666
and how

11:06.709 --> 11:08.711
it ties back
to the events unfolding

11:08.755 --> 11:11.409
since the UFO crash of '47.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.111
<i>Where's Jones?</i>

11:17.154 --> 11:18.503
Sheriff is questioning him.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.070
A little heat from the fuzz

11:20.114 --> 11:21.811
should make it harder for him
to commit any murders

11:21.855 --> 11:24.118
and give him no excuse
to refuse our ploy.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.510
I'm impressed.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.469
Mm. Let's
clink whiskeys

11:27.512 --> 11:29.297
once we have consciously
uncoupled my family

11:29.340 --> 11:30.820
from the walking
body snatcher.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.474
Agreed.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.694
You're gonna have to temper your
nerves if we want to sell this.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.739
I know. I know.

11:36.783 --> 11:39.699
I can't stop thinking
about how it felt

11:39.742 --> 11:43.006
to be trapped in a dark prison
when Noah was using me.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.181
And thinking about Max

11:44.225 --> 11:45.748
going through that
has just been hard.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.750
Iz,

11:47.794 --> 11:50.144
I never fail at the science.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.711
â™ª Wasting time...

11:51.754 --> 11:53.321
And as soon as
we give this to Jones,

11:53.364 --> 11:55.584
we'll get our Max back, okay?

11:57.760 --> 11:59.762
Did you just say "our Max"?

12:01.677 --> 12:03.766
Is it possible
that you still hold a candle

12:03.810 --> 12:06.073
for my idiot brother?

12:08.510 --> 12:09.729
Sorry.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.034
I know this is not the time

12:11.078 --> 12:12.557
and maybe you don't know
how you feel.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.646
For the record,

12:14.690 --> 12:18.259
Max held a Liz Ortecho torch
all of last year.

12:18.302 --> 12:21.610
And, yeah, he was dying
from a failing heart,

12:21.653 --> 12:25.179
but he was dying
of a broken heart.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.752
Here we go.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.759
You make a wrong turn somewhere?

12:39.802 --> 12:41.630
No. I want to help take down
the ducker

12:41.673 --> 12:43.197
who put Maria in a coma.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.068
Um, points for pep,
but you should go

12:45.112 --> 12:46.983
keep an eye on
Pancake Papi.

12:47.027 --> 12:49.769
Okay, remind me,
who is the one who figured out

12:49.812 --> 12:51.118
that Jones was in Max's body?

12:51.161 --> 12:54.599
Ultrasonic hearing
makes you a dolphin,

12:54.643 --> 12:55.731
not an asset.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.777
Swim along, Flipper.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.521
You did that on purpose.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.437
Ah!

13:08.309 --> 13:10.050
Oh, crap!

13:11.834 --> 13:13.227
Can you seriously not hear that?

13:13.270 --> 13:16.578
It's like a wind chime is
drunk-fighting a xylophone.

13:16.621 --> 13:17.797
You don't just hear things.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.799
Your ears are detecting

13:19.842 --> 13:21.409
subatomic vibrational frequencies.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.020
All matter in the universe

13:24.064 --> 13:25.413
emits signature

13:25.456 --> 13:27.458
rocks, uh, wind,

13:27.502 --> 13:28.851
fire, plants, even people.

13:28.895 --> 13:29.939
Wait, is that how I was able

13:29.983 --> 13:31.636
to find Maria in her memories?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.638
Neuronal activity
produces brain waves

13:33.682 --> 13:35.423
oscillating at
a high beta frequency.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.946
Your noggin
picked up on those.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.643
That's how you found her.
But I wonder,

13:38.687 --> 13:40.907
can you detect
resting frequency gradients?

13:40.950 --> 13:42.952
I used to get high under
the bleachers during physics.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.693
Can you explain
that last part to me?

13:44.736 --> 13:47.652
We're looking for a sword
made of alien glass.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.090
First, we need to train you
on how to find it.

13:51.308 --> 13:52.570
How are you
gonna do that?

13:52.614 --> 13:54.224
Let's play hide-and-seek.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.230
Okay, this would be
a hell of a lot easier

14:00.274 --> 14:01.666
if you weren't
staring at me.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.278
Why does it matter?
Your eyes are closed.

14:05.279 --> 14:08.891
Okay.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.381
Ugh, there's too much noise
to make anything out.

14:20.424 --> 14:21.730
This is the same
problem I was having

14:21.773 --> 14:23.210
when I was trying
to locate Maria.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.864
Can you just, I don't know,
tap on the glass

14:24.907 --> 14:26.343
so that I know I'm headed
in the right direction?

14:26.387 --> 14:27.954
Yeah, sure.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.694
Maybe Jones won't mind doing
the same with his sword.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.087
Look, dude,
I am trying.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.872
Okay? So maybe
a little less stage mom

14:32.915 --> 14:34.221
and a little more Miyagi.

14:36.049 --> 14:38.094
First time I moved something
with my mind,

14:38.138 --> 14:40.140
I turned a foul ball
into a home run.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.968
It changed my world,
but it took

14:42.011 --> 14:44.187
what felt like forever for me
to be able to do it again.

14:44.231 --> 14:45.972
So you're telling me
that you cheated

14:46.015 --> 14:47.495
and you won't even let me know
if I'm getting warmer?

14:47.538 --> 14:49.149
The point is, I didn't give up.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.542
You live and breathe music,
right?

14:51.586 --> 14:53.457
Think about it
like a song.

14:53.501 --> 14:55.068
Forget the track
as a whole.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.332
Focus on the
individual elements.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.464
Separate the bass,

15:00.508 --> 15:02.640
drums, keys, guitar.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.387
Break it down
bit by bit.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.562
Find what
you need.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.523
Okay, I hear, um...

15:15.566 --> 15:17.568
A leaky faucet.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.483
Fireplace.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.833
Wind chimes.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.228
The buzz of a lightbulb.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.230
And...

15:34.977 --> 15:36.979
There you go.

15:38.502 --> 15:40.504
What's next? Tag?

15:40.548 --> 15:42.289
Heads up, seven up.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.857
Now we're gonna
use your alien ears

15:45.901 --> 15:47.642
to fight Jones.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.601
All right.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.560
-Thank you.
-See the not-so-obvious

15:52.603 --> 15:54.562
law bros are
eyeing you.

15:54.605 --> 15:57.086
It's frustrating. I answered
all their questions before

15:57.130 --> 15:58.870
about the break-in and, uh,

15:58.914 --> 16:00.263
somehow I'm on
the hot seat again.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.091
Well, at least we have
some promising news

16:02.135 --> 16:04.137
with the handprint
on Maria's head.

16:05.268 --> 16:08.880
I mean, I wouldn't call
the Nobel team just yet, but...

16:08.924 --> 16:11.013
That depends.
What'd you find out?

16:12.058 --> 16:14.974
That your DNA fused to Maria's
through the handprint.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.976
I think that's how
the psychic connection works.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.717
It's like a virus using
the host cell RNA to live.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.850
Is it replicating, too?

16:24.592 --> 16:26.463
I don't know.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.030
Waiting for centrifuges to spin

16:28.074 --> 16:29.727
and cultures to grow, you know.

16:29.771 --> 16:32.034
Well, what can I do
to help Maria?

16:33.514 --> 16:35.168
Right now, nothing.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.171
I hit a dead end.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.433
I'm sort of in a

16:39.476 --> 16:42.001
forest-through-the-trees mode,
you know?

16:42.044 --> 16:46.005
Well, Gregory Manes is throwing
a fundraiser for Maria.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.311
Um, could be a good way to help

16:48.355 --> 16:49.617
and blow off some steam

16:49.660 --> 16:51.097
and break through
that science block.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.055
Go with me?

16:53.099 --> 16:56.754
Please. I could really use
some forgetting time.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.018
Anything for DeLuca.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.063
Couldn't agree more.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.119
Um, I'm just so pleased to see

17:13.162 --> 17:14.772
such a big crowd
for Maria DeLuca.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.344
I know to some
she's a philosopher,

17:21.388 --> 17:24.130
to some a psychic,
and to some she's family.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.175
So I wanted to help her get well

17:26.219 --> 17:28.221
so I can tell her
that she makes

17:28.264 --> 17:30.440
the best damn tequila sunrise
I've ever tasted...

17:31.746 --> 17:33.356
...and has the best damn smile

17:33.400 --> 17:35.663
I've ever seen while
making one.

17:35.706 --> 17:39.406
So, in the spirit of
Maria's constant hustle

17:39.449 --> 17:41.190
and love for music,

17:41.234 --> 17:43.540
we're going
to do a live jukebox.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.020
Uh, it's ten bucks a song

17:45.064 --> 17:47.327
and I'm gonna kick it off
with a DeLuca favorite.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.676
All right, take it away.

17:48.719 --> 17:52.201
â™ª I can't tell where the journey
will end... â™ª

17:52.245 --> 17:54.812
All right, I'll get
us some drinks.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.466
DeLuca-Daiquiri
or Maria-rita?

17:56.510 --> 17:57.641
Uh, Maria-rita.

17:57.685 --> 17:58.816
Surprise me.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.905
â™ª Too young to understand...

18:00.949 --> 18:01.993
â™ª Say I'm caught up...

18:02.037 --> 18:04.083
I'll be right back.

18:05.258 --> 18:07.390
â™ª Life will pass me by if I...

18:07.434 --> 18:09.218
Why is Rosa here?

18:09.262 --> 18:10.437
I don't want her
anywhere near Jones, okay?

18:10.480 --> 18:11.742
She already had
to deal with...

18:11.786 --> 18:13.657
Noah? Yes, I'm aware.

18:13.701 --> 18:14.919
I'm sorry.

18:14.963 --> 18:16.095
I know this has got
to be triggering.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.358
It's fine.
Thank you.

18:18.401 --> 18:21.448
Just spike
the damn drink already.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.406
We need to weaken Jones
before you decide

18:23.450 --> 18:26.235
to revisit the crazy urge to
poke the science bear with him.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.368
I couldn't just stop trying

18:28.411 --> 18:30.109
to find a way to help Maria.
He'd know.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.502
Even if you are right,
your probing

18:32.546 --> 18:33.590
is probably going to clue him in

18:33.634 --> 18:34.939
to the fact that
we are onto him.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.027
You're right. This
isn't debate time.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.899
It is stick to the plan time.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.380
Okay.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.948
â™ª I am sitting in the morning

18:43.992 --> 18:46.168
â™ª At the diner on the corner

18:46.212 --> 18:47.343
â™ª I am waiting...

18:47.387 --> 18:49.519
-Hey.
-Tell me you got something.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.130
Yeah, confused.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.435
Do you think you could
take Evil Vanilla

18:52.479 --> 18:53.958
somewhere a little quieter?
Just...

18:54.002 --> 18:55.873
There's a lot of noise
with everybody here.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.962
I know it's not ideal today,

18:58.006 --> 19:00.226
but I need you to strip away
all the sound.

19:00.269 --> 19:02.271
I just don't understand
why I have to hear him.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.578
I thought we were looking
for an alien glass sword.

19:04.621 --> 19:05.970
I think the sword is made of

19:06.014 --> 19:07.450
a mixture of
alien glass and Jones's DNA.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.626
It should give off a frequency
that's tuned to him.

19:09.670 --> 19:12.455
Yeah, it's just that there's a
lot of maybes in that sentence.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.153
And I feel like
I'm the biggest one.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.765
Yeah, okay.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.506
Anything to help Maria. Yeah.

19:19.549 --> 19:22.204
Yeah. Come on.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.641
Let's give it another shot.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.821
Sure makes a good drink,
though, huh?

19:30.865 --> 19:32.519
To Maria.
Cheers.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.480
I picked up his signature.

19:37.524 --> 19:38.568
It's-it's awful.

19:38.612 --> 19:39.830
It sounds like

19:39.874 --> 19:41.745
chaos and evil
had a hate-baby.

19:41.789 --> 19:43.269
Great.
Sure.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.488
-I'll round up Iz.
-Okay.

19:45.532 --> 19:49.362
The Lockhart Machine was
found hidden at Caulfield.

19:49.405 --> 19:53.322
How did you get it out of
a classified military prison?

19:53.366 --> 19:56.673
I had a spy
on the inside.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.675
My brother, Jim,

19:58.719 --> 20:00.503
who smuggled it out.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.201
Did he know what it did?

20:02.244 --> 20:04.203
No.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.857
But he believed
it was probably created

20:06.901 --> 20:08.207
by one of the aliens.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.686
I don't understand
how the aliens

20:09.730 --> 20:11.253
could build it in captivity.

20:11.297 --> 20:14.038
Well, all we know is what
the Caulfield files told us.

20:14.082 --> 20:16.519
It was
alien built

20:16.563 --> 20:18.042
and there seems to be

20:18.086 --> 20:19.957
an inherent risk
to working with it.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.437
And as a result,

20:21.481 --> 20:24.875
I lost one
of my own men

20:24.919 --> 20:26.834
to its study.

20:26.877 --> 20:29.576
Wait... Trevor Gunther?

20:29.619 --> 20:31.273
The boot-maker

20:31.317 --> 20:32.579
that chased me
through a cornfield?

20:32.622 --> 20:34.407
He worked on
the Lockhart machine?

20:34.450 --> 20:38.889
Trevor worked in crypto-analysis
for the United Nations.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.369
I recruited him,

20:40.413 --> 20:42.284
but he soon became
so obsessed with the machine

20:42.328 --> 20:44.286
he couldn't think
of anything else.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.201
I assigned him
a different project,

20:46.245 --> 20:48.725
but he returned to
it obsessively.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.379
When he couldn't work anymore,

20:50.423 --> 20:52.947
I gave him the best
medical care I could.

20:52.990 --> 20:56.733
Bought him a farm to
tend to ease his mind.

20:56.777 --> 20:59.258
But eventually Trevor
lost touch with the reasons

20:59.301 --> 21:01.347
he wanted the answers
in the first place.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.740
Took his own life.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.568
So let me get
this straight.

21:05.612 --> 21:08.310
You let me work on
a machine that's...

21:08.354 --> 21:10.530
what, bleeding radiation?

21:10.573 --> 21:12.488
I had every intention
of telling you.

21:12.532 --> 21:14.577
But then, within a day's time,
you were making

21:14.621 --> 21:17.276
discoveries that took
other people months.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.321
How many days did it take
for Trevor Gunther

21:19.365 --> 21:21.323
to go from code breaker
to axe murderer?

21:21.367 --> 21:23.064
I didn't realize
what was happening

21:23.107 --> 21:24.631
to him until it was too late.

21:24.674 --> 21:27.329
I got my hands on the
Caulfield files and

21:27.373 --> 21:29.070
that's when I learned
what your father had been

21:29.113 --> 21:30.419
allowing to happen repeatedly.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.421
And you lied
just like my father did.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.989
You allowed the ends
to justify the means.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.599
This is not
what I signed up for.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.209
Let me show you
one more thing.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.124
You don't like
what you hear,

21:40.168 --> 21:42.039
you can walk away forever.

21:45.521 --> 21:47.523
Are you trying
to get me drunk, Liz?

21:47.567 --> 21:50.570
Just enjoying
a little forgetting time.

21:57.272 --> 22:00.362
If I recall...

22:00.406 --> 22:04.018
you have another inspiration
that opens your mind.

22:08.109 --> 22:12.548
â™ª I'll wait for you
in Baton Rouge â™ª

22:13.375 --> 22:15.377
â™ª Miss you down
in New Orleans... â™ª

22:15.421 --> 22:17.510
Maybe you can find some

22:17.553 --> 22:19.816
while you dance
with this stubborn cowboy?

22:19.860 --> 22:22.166
â™ª Wait for you while she slips

22:22.210 --> 22:25.648
â™ª In something comfortable

22:25.692 --> 22:30.349
â™ª I hope
you're resting quietly. â™ª

22:32.394 --> 22:35.049
I feel like I'm picking up
something here.

22:35.092 --> 22:38.357
You're the alien
bloodhound-- get to sniffing.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.838
Is Liz gonna be okay
at the Pony by herself?

22:41.882 --> 22:42.926
Yeah.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.493
We grab the sword and get back.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.582
Ah, this is near
where Deputy Pete

22:46.626 --> 22:49.498
and the good 'ol boys
brigade spotted Jones.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.631
Also near where the
astronomers' car was found.

22:52.849 --> 22:55.243
You're up, Ortecho.

22:58.246 --> 23:00.204
Focus.

23:00.248 --> 23:02.032
Pick apart
the frequency.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.556
Listen for
the right one.

23:03.599 --> 23:06.341
Okay, we get it,
Obi-Wan Junkyardi.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.169
-Just chill.
-Alien puberty's a bitch.

23:08.212 --> 23:09.518
Oh, really? I didn't know that.

23:09.562 --> 23:10.867
She needs someone
to guide her through it.

23:10.911 --> 23:12.391
Yeah, not mansplain.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.827
I think I'm helping
-more than you.
-Oh, my God!

23:13.870 --> 23:15.394
Can you guys please shut up?

23:15.437 --> 23:17.221
Okay, I can't hear anything
over your mindfulness.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.049
Just stay there!

23:19.093 --> 23:20.964
Okay...

23:21.008 --> 23:22.879
Okay, stay cool.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.707
Identify your surroundings.

23:24.751 --> 23:27.710
I hear...

23:27.754 --> 23:30.060
telephone lines buzzing...

23:30.104 --> 23:32.672
uh, coyote growling...

23:32.715 --> 23:36.284
[car engines humming]cars on a distant highway...

23:36.327 --> 23:39.418
And...

23:42.377 --> 23:44.423
The sword's that way.

23:47.513 --> 23:50.211
â™ª Good, good night

23:50.254 --> 23:53.257
â™ª Elisabeth, good night...

23:53.301 --> 23:55.521
You know,
before you left Roswell...

23:55.564 --> 23:58.741
I practiced this song
for months on guitar.

23:58.785 --> 24:01.831
I wanted to surprise you
on the Crashdown rooftop.

24:01.875 --> 24:04.530
With candles, flowers.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.751
But I guess
I lost my nerve.

24:09.622 --> 24:13.277
One day, a tipsy Maria told
me you were gonna do that.

24:13.321 --> 24:14.496
â™ª We can't all be cowboys...

24:14.540 --> 24:15.976
Yeah, I waited
for the moment,

24:16.019 --> 24:17.934
and it never came.

24:17.978 --> 24:21.329
I just assumed Rosa's death
put an end to all that.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.941
Why, after everything...

24:24.985 --> 24:27.248
â™ª Some of us are dancers
on the midway â™ª

24:27.291 --> 24:29.642
...do we keep
orbiting each other?

24:29.685 --> 24:32.340
â™ª We roam from town to town...

24:36.387 --> 24:38.825
Let's get out of here.

24:41.958 --> 24:45.005
Gregory has a big raffle
planned for Maria.

24:45.048 --> 24:46.659
I know.

24:46.702 --> 24:50.314
I can think of something
a little better to help her.

24:52.621 --> 24:56.059
Maybe if you took a look at
the mark Jones left on my chest,

24:56.103 --> 24:58.627
you could discover
something.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.702
You still got that expensive
tequila we bought together?

25:29.745 --> 25:31.878
Yeah, it's in the
cabinet next to sink.

25:31.921 --> 25:33.357
Uh, you start a fire.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.229
I will mix the drinks.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.197
You okay?

25:47.241 --> 25:49.199
Yes.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.462
Yeah, just...

25:51.506 --> 25:54.030
mixed feelings being
back in your house.

25:54.074 --> 25:56.511
You know,
our bottle of booze

25:56.555 --> 25:58.426
wasn't the only thing
I couldn't get rid of.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.690
I still have

26:01.734 --> 26:04.563
the microscope you used
when you'd stay here to do work.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.869
You kept my swabs?

26:06.913 --> 26:08.305
And petri dishes.

26:08.349 --> 26:09.611
And culture slides.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.134
You sure do know
how to charm a girl.

26:11.178 --> 26:12.396
Find me my microscope.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.007
I'll finish our drinks.

26:21.405 --> 26:24.583
The sword is right there--
it's behind that wood paneling.

26:27.368 --> 26:29.849
What are we waiting for?
Let's get it and go!

26:29.892 --> 26:32.416
Don't touch it. If you
don't have Jones's DNA,

26:32.460 --> 26:33.722
it'll melt your skin right off.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.594
Which is why I came prepared.

26:46.256 --> 26:48.345
Oh, yeah!

26:48.389 --> 26:50.304
Once I fill this bad boy
with quick-dry cement,

26:50.347 --> 26:52.915
Jones's intergalactic appendage
will be out of commission.

26:57.485 --> 26:59.618
Oh, my God.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.924
Liz is at Max's house
with Jones.

27:01.968 --> 27:03.752
Wait, if he's alone, that means
we can all take him down.

27:03.796 --> 27:06.668
Whoa, cool your jets, cowgirl.
You are skipping this rodeo.

27:06.712 --> 27:07.756
No, you can't bench me.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.715
Jones is powerful
and dangerous.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.934
Okay, but you've
been training, Isobel.

27:11.978 --> 27:12.935
You beat Noah.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.110
No, I didn't.

27:14.154 --> 27:16.460
It took three of us
to slay that monster.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.462
And Max was the one
who finished him off.

27:18.506 --> 27:21.291
But you're right,
I have been training.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.903
To protect the people I love.

27:23.946 --> 27:25.861
Noah hurt us both.

27:25.905 --> 27:28.908
And he is nothing
compared to Jones.

27:29.996 --> 27:33.477
I'm not letting you
get hurt again, Rosa.

27:38.482 --> 27:40.963
Trevor Gunther did this.

27:41.007 --> 27:43.705
I thought they were
the ravings of a madman,

27:43.749 --> 27:45.576
until you found
the same symbol

27:45.620 --> 27:47.143
inside the Lockhartmachine.

27:47.187 --> 27:49.537
Do you think the machine tried
to put it in his head?

27:49.580 --> 27:51.713
I think it was trying
to talk to him.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.628
And he became obsessed

27:53.672 --> 27:55.499
with hearing what it
was trying to say.

27:55.543 --> 27:57.588
Do you know
how insane that sounds?

27:57.632 --> 27:58.981
I mean,
it's a machine.

27:59.025 --> 28:00.809
Made by aliens.

28:00.853 --> 28:03.812
Okay, then why don't we take it
to them to try to solve it?

28:03.856 --> 28:06.510
You think I should tap one
on the shoulder?

28:06.554 --> 28:08.295
Ask them to step
inside the halls

28:08.338 --> 28:09.992
of a clandestine company to--

28:10.036 --> 28:11.167
I get it.

28:11.211 --> 28:12.516
We know that the aliens
from the crash

28:12.560 --> 28:14.214
of '47 weren't just refugees

28:14.257 --> 28:15.737
but resistance
to a war.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.958
The alien that lit men
on fire wasn't either.

28:19.001 --> 28:22.875
He was an enemy
of both them and us.

28:22.918 --> 28:24.572
He was never caught.

28:24.615 --> 28:26.835
Your father wondered
if there were more

28:26.879 --> 28:29.055
like him hidden in the ranks.

28:29.098 --> 28:32.101
My father was
a paranoid xenophobe.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.581
He was.

28:33.624 --> 28:36.018
So, what, did you pick me

28:36.062 --> 28:37.672
to prove him wrong?

28:37.716 --> 28:41.632
I picked you because I know
you fell in love with an alien.

28:43.547 --> 28:46.376
Alex, I have no interest
in who you love.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.552
Only that I assume
there's a desire

28:48.596 --> 28:50.772
to view life differently
because of it.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.383
I understand
your journey.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.690
Undoing your father's
devastating work

28:55.734 --> 28:57.170
is important to you.

28:57.213 --> 29:00.260
I thought I could
help you accomplish that.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.175
And I thought
together

29:02.218 --> 29:03.785
we might be able to make

29:03.829 --> 29:06.483
all the suffering worth it.

29:09.356 --> 29:12.054
This is the Caulfield file

29:12.098 --> 29:13.752
I withheld from you.

29:20.410 --> 29:23.152
Let me know what you decide.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.596
Mm.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.468
Mmm.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.513
I mean, you've
always had a knack

29:36.557 --> 29:39.168
for making something
strong, yet tasty.

29:39.212 --> 29:42.955
My chemistry minor presents
itself in unusual ways.

29:43.869 --> 29:46.088
Aren't you gonna
examine me?

29:46.132 --> 29:47.960
Of course.

29:55.663 --> 29:58.927
Last time we did this,
you blew out my radio.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.842
Well, the night's still young.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.975
Plenty of time for surprises.

30:11.331 --> 30:12.941
See anything
interesting?

30:12.985 --> 30:16.292
Hmm, this microscope
is too...

30:16.336 --> 30:19.774
weak to see any significant
inconsistencies in your cells.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.603
But you did say Jones' cells
are like a virus, right?

30:22.646 --> 30:24.083
Bonded to mine somehow?

30:24.126 --> 30:26.999
Yes, but that's
at the micro-genetic level.

30:28.348 --> 30:30.263
Human DNA only has two strands.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.308
But... aliens have a third.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.484
And you think this third strand
has something to do

30:34.528 --> 30:36.138
with how the connections work?

30:36.182 --> 30:38.140
According to my research,

30:38.184 --> 30:40.882
it seems to act
like a bonding agent.

30:40.926 --> 30:43.058
Can the connection be cut?

30:45.800 --> 30:47.671
I don't think Jones wants

30:47.715 --> 30:49.630
to severe his connection
with Maria.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.545
Hmm.

30:51.588 --> 30:54.417
What are you thinking
Jones is after?

30:54.461 --> 30:57.333
Ultimately?

30:57.377 --> 30:59.205
You.

31:02.338 --> 31:05.602
Jones spoke so much about
how he wants to heal you.

31:07.256 --> 31:10.869
I think in that truth...
hides a lie.

31:12.479 --> 31:14.568
I just haven't found it yet.

31:14.611 --> 31:17.353
But you asked
if I could...

31:17.397 --> 31:19.965
cut connections.

31:20.008 --> 31:23.359
I created enzymes that build
bonds when I rebuilt your heart.

31:23.403 --> 31:26.058
Theoretically, I could...

31:26.101 --> 31:27.886
isolate one
that has the capability

31:27.929 --> 31:29.322
to slice through them.

31:31.672 --> 31:33.892
What about that, uh...

31:33.935 --> 31:37.721
that alien inhibitor
you used on Noah?

31:39.158 --> 31:41.029
Would that work?

31:43.945 --> 31:45.904
It's a good theory.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.036
If only I had any left.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.082
Hmm. Yeah.

31:50.125 --> 31:51.953
Yeah, that is
a predicament.

31:51.997 --> 31:56.175
Well, I guess that just
leaves me with one question.

31:56.218 --> 31:58.003
And what's that?

31:58.046 --> 32:01.702
Should we drink
to just how clever you are?

32:03.008 --> 32:05.097
Or what a shame it is
that your death

32:05.140 --> 32:07.926
will give me the strength
to break into Maria's mind?

32:17.065 --> 32:20.547
You know, I see
what Max saw in you.

32:20.590 --> 32:23.289
You are brilliant,
and beautiful.

32:23.332 --> 32:26.205
But like me, you, uh,

32:26.248 --> 32:30.296
are always going to be intrigued
by something a little dangerous.

32:32.298 --> 32:33.952
You're right
about the last part.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.823
The antidote
I dosed you with

32:35.866 --> 32:37.216
will make you an ordinary man,

32:37.259 --> 32:39.783
and I am going to put
an ordinary hole in you.

32:39.827 --> 32:42.003
Oh, there's no way
you would hurt the man

32:42.047 --> 32:43.526
you pretend not to care for.

32:43.570 --> 32:45.746
Me, on the
other hand,

32:45.789 --> 32:47.966
I <i>can</i> hurt you.

32:48.792 --> 32:51.012
Deputy Pete's right outside.

32:51.056 --> 32:54.015
He'll respond to shots fired.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.278
Well, then, I will jump
into his feeble mind

32:56.322 --> 32:59.281
and tell him to go park
a few miles away.

33:07.246 --> 33:11.815
As for the ruse that y'all tried
to set up today,

33:11.859 --> 33:14.601
when I read such
anxiety in Isobel,

33:14.644 --> 33:16.646
such anger in Michael

33:16.690 --> 33:20.172
and such desperation from
you to get me to drink,

33:20.215 --> 33:24.132
I became a tad bit suspicious.

33:38.190 --> 33:40.844
Did you try
to drug me, Elizabeth?

33:48.852 --> 33:51.638
Now, I may look
like Max, darling,

33:51.681 --> 33:53.727
but I am something else
entirely.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.688
I know you're in there,
Max Evans.

33:58.732 --> 34:00.168
I need you to be
the stubborn cowboy

34:00.212 --> 34:02.736
that forgoes all rationale
and fights for me.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.830
It seems your Max
has a little less fight in him

34:09.873 --> 34:11.005
than you hoped.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.529
Well, that's not
the case for me.

34:13.573 --> 34:15.401
Oh. Oh...

34:20.928 --> 34:22.886
You seem to be
downing those, uh,

34:22.930 --> 34:24.410
Roswell Rocket sodas
pretty hard.

34:24.453 --> 34:26.455
Yeah, well, that's not exactly
the blood of Christ

34:26.499 --> 34:27.674
in your hand.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.893
I won't tell the big guy
if you don't.

34:31.243 --> 34:34.202
How'd that, uh,
that test turn out?

34:34.246 --> 34:37.118
You know,
I thought I kicked ass,

34:37.162 --> 34:38.859
and in the end,
it didn't matter.

34:38.902 --> 34:40.861
Uh-huh. That sucks.

34:40.904 --> 34:42.558
Yeah.

34:42.602 --> 34:45.039
You needed a win.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.781
â™ª In the trunk of my car...

34:47.824 --> 34:50.175
You know, God, he's...

34:50.218 --> 34:53.003
he's interesting
like that sometimes.

34:53.047 --> 34:55.093
He doesn't just
provide you with answers,

34:55.136 --> 34:56.659
you got to fight for them.

34:56.703 --> 34:59.749
Yeah, I'm just...

34:59.793 --> 35:03.101
worried I'm always gonna live on
the sidelines and never get to.

35:04.406 --> 35:08.018
Well, I, uh, could reference
a pertinent verse

35:08.062 --> 35:11.021
from the book of Romans here,
but, um,

35:11.065 --> 35:12.893
I think the book of Biggie

35:12.936 --> 35:14.677
might be better.

35:14.721 --> 35:18.507
His song, uh, "Sky's the Limit,"
I-I think it might have

35:18.551 --> 35:20.857
some of the answers
you're looking for.

35:23.991 --> 35:25.993
Uh, where you going?

35:27.777 --> 35:29.170
To the jukebox.

35:35.176 --> 35:38.136
You think you can escape me?

35:43.228 --> 35:46.318
Good night, Elizabeth.

35:52.324 --> 35:55.153
Somebody left the fundraiser
without making a donation.

35:55.196 --> 35:56.284
Be careful,
it didn't work.

35:56.328 --> 35:57.851
The inhibitor did nothing.

35:59.244 --> 36:00.593
How is that possible?

36:00.636 --> 36:02.247
No offense, Iz,

36:02.290 --> 36:04.162
but I'm getting a little
tired of these chats.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.561
Michael, don't!

36:13.997 --> 36:15.869
Michael?

36:15.912 --> 36:17.479
How are you able
to hold that thing?

36:17.523 --> 36:19.351
I'm the Dictator's son.

36:19.394 --> 36:20.526
You're his heir.

36:22.005 --> 36:24.051
So that means you're...

36:25.487 --> 36:26.880
You're my...

36:27.837 --> 36:29.187
Hello, son.

36:36.150 --> 36:38.979
Thank you for bringing me
my sword.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.335
That's why the
drug didn't work.

36:47.379 --> 36:49.642
He's not an ordinary alien.

36:49.685 --> 36:52.035
You're the Dictator.

36:52.079 --> 36:53.559
Aren't you?

36:55.300 --> 36:57.040
Well, I'd say
it's time for a coup.

36:57.084 --> 36:58.520
You really think
the little girl who was

36:58.564 --> 37:01.262
so easily manipulated
by Noah Bracken--

37:01.306 --> 37:03.917
one of the weakest
on our planet--

37:03.960 --> 37:06.180
stands any chance
against my power?

37:06.224 --> 37:08.356
Sticks and stones.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.714
Oh, that may have worked before,

37:18.758 --> 37:21.587
but now, in this century,
what do you say, uh,

37:21.630 --> 37:23.023
you're screwed.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.331
See, this isn't just
an extension of my will,

37:26.374 --> 37:28.246
this is a reservoir
for my power.

37:28.289 --> 37:30.813
Turning three
against one

37:30.857 --> 37:33.381
into an army against three.

37:33.425 --> 37:35.209
Really elevating to a new level

37:35.253 --> 37:36.950
of supreme ass...

37:36.993 --> 37:40.867
Sit down, and show some respect
for your father, son.

37:42.782 --> 37:46.089
How many people did you kill
to get that power?

37:46.133 --> 37:48.178
Well, start counting
the stars, darling.

37:48.222 --> 37:49.963
I'll tell you when to stop.

37:50.790 --> 37:52.270
Isobel!

37:56.796 --> 37:59.973
Now what to do with you three?

38:00.016 --> 38:01.366
You let us go.

38:02.497 --> 38:06.806
Your arrogance
does not cover your cracks.

38:06.849 --> 38:09.417
You need something from me.

38:09.461 --> 38:12.768
And if you hurt them,
I will never give it to you.

38:12.812 --> 38:15.249
And what makes you think
I need something from you?

38:15.293 --> 38:16.468
You went through an awful lot
of trouble today

38:16.511 --> 38:18.208
to get me
behind a microscope.

38:18.252 --> 38:21.473
You couldn't resist
testing what I know.

38:22.648 --> 38:23.997
You need Max's body.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.216
And if you're curious

38:26.260 --> 38:28.393
about severing connections,

38:28.436 --> 38:32.440
then I think you want to be more
than just a guest inside of it.

38:34.050 --> 38:35.661
Maybe you're not
as smart as you think.

38:35.704 --> 38:38.664
I'm as smart
as you are confident.

38:38.707 --> 38:40.492
And I'm pretty confident
you've figured out

38:40.535 --> 38:43.408
that there aren't a lot
of alien scientists.

38:44.234 --> 38:45.453
You're gonna need me.

38:45.497 --> 38:47.150
Maybe.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.849
But I certainly don't need
to keep them alive

38:49.892 --> 38:51.894
to make you do what I say.

39:05.865 --> 39:08.955
It's gonna take more
than a spindly drug addict

39:08.998 --> 39:11.914
with a pop gun to stop me.

39:11.958 --> 39:14.874
Then how about the sheriff and
the full-force Roswell PD?

39:14.917 --> 39:16.528
I called and told
them the robbers

39:16.571 --> 39:18.399
were back at Max's house,
so unless you think

39:18.443 --> 39:20.488
you can take them all out
without making the local paper,

39:20.532 --> 39:23.143
I think this is where
we part ways.

39:23.186 --> 39:25.319
It's a shame.

39:30.237 --> 39:32.544
Until next time.

39:34.241 --> 39:36.809
-Get down!
-Go, go, go.

39:40.421 --> 39:42.336
We can't just let him get away.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.555
Between the
burning car and cops,

39:43.598 --> 39:45.383
I don't think we
have a choice.

39:49.517 --> 39:51.214
-Let's see
those hands!

39:51.258 --> 39:53.129
Hands up!

39:58.831 --> 40:00.223
Oh, God. Oh, God.

40:00.267 --> 40:02.225
She's still here.

40:07.013 --> 40:08.623
No.

40:08.667 --> 40:11.104
No. No.â™ª This is only
the beginning... â™ª

40:11.147 --> 40:13.280
He took the pod.

40:15.151 --> 40:19.678
â™ª The start of things to come

40:28.948 --> 40:31.429
â™ª To the point of no return...

40:34.475 --> 40:38.044
Sure you can't open your
eyes? Just for a sec?

40:38.087 --> 40:40.873
â™ª Too far without...

40:40.916 --> 40:44.485
Could really use one of those
fireside chats about now.

40:44.529 --> 40:47.662
â™ª Into the shadows...

40:47.706 --> 40:49.621
Damn.

40:52.406 --> 40:56.149
â™ª Where the darkness
surrounds... â™ª

40:56.192 --> 40:59.152
"First activation,
March 11, 1969."

40:59.195 --> 41:03.722
â™ª Into the shadows

41:06.464 --> 41:09.205
â™ª Follow me

41:09.249 --> 41:11.686
â™ª Into the shadows...

41:11.730 --> 41:14.602
<i>I told you I'd be back.</i>

41:19.259 --> 41:20.608
Where are you taking me?

41:20.652 --> 41:23.176
Wherever the hell
I want you to go.

41:30.531 --> 41:33.708
Oh, hey. Let me know if you
want the usual, Patricia.

41:33.752 --> 41:35.754
What's the date?

41:35.797 --> 41:39.366
March 11, 1969.

41:41.324 --> 41:44.153
This seems to be
a very important day.

41:44.197 --> 41:46.504
And now that
we're here together,

41:46.547 --> 41:48.506
you're gonna show it to me.
