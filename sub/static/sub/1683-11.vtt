00:00.046 --> 00:01.421
<i>Previously on Sleepy Hollow...</i>

00:01.423 --> 00:04.136
When I joined the Force, I was
gone so often, my wife left me.

00:04.137 --> 00:05.988
Then my little girl
got hit by a car.

00:05.990 --> 00:08.958
So if God's got a plan, who's it for?
Me or him?

00:08.960 --> 00:12.457
God my have a plan, Captain.
But we have one, too.

00:12.458 --> 00:14.957
What the hell are you?!
How did you know what I said?

00:14.958 --> 00:16.823
- What the hell are you talking about?
- What's wrong with you?

00:16.824 --> 00:18.072
Let's go.

00:18.385 --> 00:22.560
- Come out and face me, Moloch.
- Moloch: I offer this warning.

00:22.561 --> 00:25.142
The Saint's name is a sign.

00:25.143 --> 00:27.955
- Crane! What happened?
- Moloch.

00:28.309 --> 00:30.542
He's coming for your soul.

00:33.344 --> 00:35.283
Listen to me.

00:35.614 --> 00:38.134
I know it feels like
none of this makes sense,

00:38.220 --> 00:41.132
and you wanna hold on to
whatever's left of the life you knew.

00:41.133 --> 00:44.340
We both do. But we can't.
You told me that.

00:44.341 --> 00:47.575
So, I need you
to take the first step.

00:47.577 --> 00:51.414
I'll be right here with you.
You won't be alone.

01:00.333 --> 01:03.686
- Hell hath frozen over.
- Indeed.

01:03.687 --> 01:04.953
(Laughs)

01:04.955 --> 01:07.422
Now, may we return
to the task at hand?

01:08.548 --> 01:11.310
I don't understand your
obsession with my finery.

01:11.312 --> 01:15.122
Demons threaten our very existence
with the promise of Apocalypse.

01:15.239 --> 01:16.766
Oh, God, this wounds.

01:17.001 --> 01:20.682
One sign of the impending
Apocalypse is surely skinny jeans.

01:20.683 --> 01:22.554
You said that if we survived
the New Year,

01:22.556 --> 01:24.823
I could take a whack
at updating your wardrobe.

01:24.825 --> 01:28.678
Think of it as camouflage.
Now Moloch might not recognize you.

01:28.679 --> 01:31.996
You quip, but that's the first sensible
thing you've said on the matter.

01:32.368 --> 01:33.775
Absolutely not.

01:33.788 --> 01:34.888
(Groans)

01:35.550 --> 01:37.026
This...

01:37.378 --> 01:39.250
The Saint's name.

01:39.776 --> 01:42.043
I can make
neither rhyme nor reason of it.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.992
Look, I wanna figure out

01:43.993 --> 01:46.964
the meaning behind your encounter
with Moloch as much as you,

01:46.982 --> 01:48.644
but we've been at this
for days.

01:49.323 --> 01:51.750
It's because
of the way he spoke.

01:51.752 --> 01:54.386
I touched her soul once.

01:54.388 --> 01:58.662
Soon it will be mine forever.

01:59.450 --> 02:03.228
It instilled a fear in me
like I've never felt before.

02:03.230 --> 02:05.784
I'm not gonna let him get to us.

02:06.316 --> 02:07.961
You ever heard
of a boondoggle?

02:07.962 --> 02:10.580
If it's another type of constrictive
trouser, I'd rather not.

02:10.580 --> 02:13.016
- Try these.
- Oh, for...

02:13.492 --> 02:17.260
A boondoggle is
an exercise in futility.

02:17.411 --> 02:20.167
It's a time suck,
a fool's errand.

02:20.168 --> 02:24.483
And... You're suggesting Moloch
created such a mission for me.

02:24.485 --> 02:27.286
I think that maybe we did
some damage to his plan,

02:27.288 --> 02:29.443
and that maybe he's getting
a little nervous.

02:29.444 --> 02:32.278
So he concocted a mind game
to get to you.

02:35.468 --> 02:37.149
That was fast.

02:37.331 --> 02:40.432
You have your way
of dealing with reality,

02:40.434 --> 02:42.691
and I have mine.

02:42.692 --> 02:45.736
If you're gonna keep wearing that
damn thing, I have two words for you.

02:46.095 --> 02:47.979
Dry cleaning.

02:49.006 --> 02:52.141
Pick two words I understand.

02:54.414 --> 02:58.380
Interviewer: "How strong is your daughter?
Strong enough to fight for her soul?"

02:58.658 --> 03:00.935
Did you say those words
to Captain Frank Irving?

03:00.936 --> 03:03.587
No, I didn't.
I wouldn't.

03:03.588 --> 03:05.607
Interviewer: Did you know
Captain Irving or his daughter

03:05.608 --> 03:07.630
prior to the incident
in the park?

03:07.690 --> 03:09.777
Vendor: No, I've never met
either of them before.

03:09.778 --> 03:12.943
Sir, the whole time they questioned him,
the polygraph never spiked.

03:13.174 --> 03:15.348
He truly believes he didn't
threaten your daughter.

03:15.349 --> 03:17.102
Polygraphs have been
fooled before.

03:17.104 --> 03:20.695
We have no probable cause with this guy.
No priors, no convictions.

03:20.696 --> 03:22.394
Not even a parking
infraction.

03:23.499 --> 03:25.070
You gonna press charges?

03:25.071 --> 03:26.945
Interviewer:
Did you make those statements?

03:26.947 --> 03:28.714
Vendor: How many times do I have
to answer the same question?

03:28.716 --> 03:31.164
- Interviewer: Yes or no, sir.
- Vendor: No! I didn't say it.

03:31.165 --> 03:33.124
I never said that.
I never said anything.

03:33.125 --> 03:37.289
How strong is your daughter?
Strong enough to fight for her soul?

03:37.512 --> 03:40.380
- What did you say to me?
- God may have a plan, Captain.

03:40.544 --> 03:42.452
But we have one, too.

03:42.464 --> 03:44.775
He really did say
those things to me.

03:44.776 --> 03:47.439
Vendor: Please, I don't even
know what's going on here.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.664
You have to believe me.

03:48.665 --> 03:51.276
Then he acted like
he'd just been sleepwalking.

03:51.556 --> 03:52.950
The woman he bumped into.

03:52.951 --> 03:56.155
- How did you know what I said?!
- What the hell are you talking about?

03:57.391 --> 03:58.596
We locate her yet?

03:58.597 --> 04:01.098
Yes, sir, we I.D.'d her
off of park surveillance.

04:01.099 --> 04:03.132
I'm sure she'll be able
to back up your story.

04:04.942 --> 04:06.810
Let me know when
she gets here.

04:22.357 --> 04:23.690
Woman:
Excuse me.

04:23.691 --> 04:26.125
I'm here
for Captain Irving.

04:26.127 --> 04:28.528
Oh, yeah. Uh, follow me.
We'll get you checked in.

04:28.530 --> 04:29.529
Thank you.

04:29.531 --> 04:31.230
(Whooshing)

04:38.138 --> 04:40.006
(Cell phone ringing)

04:40.634 --> 04:41.743
Irving.

04:41.744 --> 04:44.362
<i>Demon voice: How much
do you care for your daughter?</i>

04:44.387 --> 04:46.179
___

04:46.181 --> 04:49.407
- Who is this?
<i>- Someone with a plan.</i>

04:53.664 --> 04:55.242
What the hell do you want?

04:55.245 --> 04:56.424
___

04:56.425 --> 04:58.528
<i>The Witnesses have a Bible.</i>

04:59.571 --> 05:01.772
<i>It belonged
to George Washington.</i>

05:03.434 --> 05:09.281
<i>Have it in your possession by nightfall,
or we take your daughter.</i>

05:17.415 --> 05:19.482
♪

05:39.237 --> 05:41.964
- Who are you?!
- Captain.

05:42.131 --> 05:44.741
What happened...?
I don't understand.

05:47.829 --> 05:49.834
What did I do?

05:51.358 --> 05:53.327
Boland: <i>You're talking
about possession.</i>

05:53.328 --> 05:55.231
Irving: <i>I don't know
what I'm talking about.</i>

05:55.441 --> 05:59.110
But, Father, I saw what I saw
and I heard what I heard.

05:59.354 --> 06:01.830
Something evil is threatening
to take my daughter.

06:01.831 --> 06:06.482
Even the Vatican acknowledges
the devil can take hold of a mortal soul.

06:06.540 --> 06:09.335
I can't let anything
happen to Macey.

06:09.812 --> 06:10.933
Not again.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.755
Take your family somewhere safe.
I'll meet you there.

06:13.756 --> 06:15.063
<i>Thank you, Father.</i>

06:24.960 --> 06:26.560
This is Washington's Bible?

06:26.875 --> 06:29.564
The very one that
Crane was buried with.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.907
How did George Washington's
Bible get buried with you?

06:32.908 --> 06:35.308
One of the many mysteries
surrounding it.

06:35.309 --> 06:38.118
Other than the fact that it belonged
to the Father of our country,

06:38.119 --> 06:40.256
do you know
what's special about it?

06:40.803 --> 06:42.760
The answers are
in Washington's Bible.

06:42.761 --> 06:47.093
Katrina told me this contains
the answers to defeating evil.

06:47.094 --> 06:51.201
True, but aside from some passages
we flagged about bearing witness...

06:51.475 --> 06:53.693
We haven't found anything
out of the ordinary in it.

06:53.695 --> 06:56.749
Nonetheless, if the Forces
of Darkness are after it,

06:56.750 --> 06:59.500
clearly it contains some
secrets we're yet to uncover.

06:59.501 --> 07:03.074
I don't want it falling into the wrong
hands any more than you do.

07:03.115 --> 07:04.949
But I have to protect
my daughter.

07:04.951 --> 07:07.951
- You're not suggesting we hand it over?
- No.

07:08.466 --> 07:11.133
I am suggesting you help me
take this demon down,

07:11.134 --> 07:13.366
and if there's anything in that Bible
that can help us do it,

07:13.367 --> 07:16.056
I want chapter
and verse in my hands yesterday.

07:17.429 --> 07:19.663
I'm bringing my family
to a safe house.

07:19.665 --> 07:22.782
- Let me know what you find.
- Yes, sir.

07:31.343 --> 07:35.245
Corbin has an entire section
on possession.

07:35.446 --> 07:36.981
This one.

07:36.983 --> 07:39.683
Talks about a woman
<i>he</i> apprehended.

07:39.685 --> 07:43.604
Thought to be possessed by a demon
who could jump from body to body...

07:43.705 --> 07:47.691
Says she could never account for the
things she said or did during that time.

07:47.693 --> 07:51.862
That sounds remarkably similar
to what the Captain described.

07:54.032 --> 07:56.667
He made a recording
of the encounter.

08:03.620 --> 08:07.045
<i>What you're about to see
is a 19-year-old woman</i>

08:07.046 --> 08:10.694
<i>who attempted to break into my cabin.
I subdued her.</i>

08:13.084 --> 08:17.258
<i>She's not herself. I've known
this woman for a couple of years.</i>

08:17.444 --> 08:21.425
<i>While she's troubled, this is...
This is something different.</i>

08:22.369 --> 08:23.935
<i>I believe she's possessed.</i>

08:24.831 --> 08:26.839
<i>The demon comes and goes.</i>

08:27.128 --> 08:31.173
<i>But it definitely has taken her over.
It's become violent.</i>

08:31.903 --> 08:34.366
<i>Now, I'm gonna try to free her.</i>

08:35.849 --> 08:38.015
<i>I'm recording what'll follow
because, frankly</i>

08:38.017 --> 08:40.607
<i>I'm not sure
either of us will survive it.</i>

08:51.056 --> 08:54.224
Abbie: Oh, my God.
That's Jenny.

09:26.481 --> 09:29.102
Season 1, Episode 11
"Vessel"

09:29.189 --> 09:32.189
Synced by Reef
www.addic7ed.com

09:32.257 --> 09:34.082
So you found my file.

09:35.281 --> 09:37.011
We saw the video.

09:38.260 --> 09:39.814
How much of it did you see?

09:39.815 --> 09:43.295
Merely enough to identify you
as Sheriff Corbin's subject.

09:43.296 --> 09:47.198
We did not wish to violate your
privacy by not consulting you first.

09:48.344 --> 09:52.007
I've never seen it.
I don't remember any of it.

09:52.296 --> 09:54.230
Corbin always said
it was better that way.

09:54.231 --> 09:57.342
Unfortunately, we don't
have that choice.

09:57.344 --> 10:00.617
We need to watch it to see how
Corbin took down the demon.

10:00.618 --> 10:03.623
We think the same one
that came for you is back.

10:03.842 --> 10:06.859
- How do you know?
- We cannot be certain.

10:06.899 --> 10:10.300
But surely it is connected
to Moloch's greater plan.

10:10.301 --> 10:13.631
It wants something from us.
Washington's Bible.

10:13.632 --> 10:16.561
- So give it the Bible.
- We would...

10:16.749 --> 10:20.445
If I was not convinced that Washington
embedded messages within it.

10:20.446 --> 10:22.879
<i>Critical</i> to the war
against Moloch.

10:23.351 --> 10:26.338
He was a leader
in the field of spy craft.

10:26.339 --> 10:28.239
So evil wants
your playbook.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.465
In exchange, it won't
harm Irving's daughter.

10:30.466 --> 10:31.566
Macey?

10:31.629 --> 10:34.853
Must be cool, having a sister
to look out for you like that.

10:34.954 --> 10:39.221
To stop whoever or whatever it is
that's threatening to get to her,

10:39.222 --> 10:41.803
we need to know
what we're dealing with.

10:52.798 --> 10:55.099
Demon Jenny:
<i>This vessel was chosen.</i>

10:56.235 --> 10:57.902
<i>She has been marked.</i>

10:58.271 --> 11:01.691
August: <i>Why? Who are you?
Name yourself.</i>

11:02.030 --> 11:05.556
You are worthless.
Stay away.

11:05.557 --> 11:06.756
(Hisses)

11:09.248 --> 11:13.886
You think that will protect you?
That trinket?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.141
Your faith?

11:16.142 --> 11:17.408
(Chuckles)

11:17.478 --> 11:21.895
"Truly I tell you, if you have
faith the size of a mustard seed,"

11:21.896 --> 11:23.149
(Speaking foreign language)

11:23.150 --> 11:27.669
"You will say to this mountain,
'Move from here to there'."

11:27.670 --> 11:32.825
"The mountain will move, and nothing
will be impossible for you."

11:32.827 --> 11:35.994
The war will come,

11:35.996 --> 11:39.331
and you will be among
its first casualties.

11:39.333 --> 11:43.068
<i>You will die, August Corbin,</i>

11:43.070 --> 11:46.004
<i>at the hands
of the Horseman of Death.</i>

11:49.125 --> 11:52.737
<i>And I will kill the sister.</i>

11:53.155 --> 11:57.084
<i>- August: Jenny's sister?
- Must die.</i>

11:57.600 --> 11:59.218
I will kill her.

11:59.508 --> 12:01.528
I will kill Abbie.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.156
(Snarls)

12:12.765 --> 12:15.992
- You never told me.
- We weren't exactly besties back then.

12:15.993 --> 12:19.352
Jenny, you were possessed by a demon.
I could've done something.

12:19.353 --> 12:21.119
At what point
in the last seven years

12:21.120 --> 12:24.078
would you have believed me
if I told you, "Lieutenant?"

12:26.079 --> 12:31.060
Look, I haven't said anything
because it doesn't matter anymore.

12:31.061 --> 12:32.992
The demon's been gone
for years.

12:33.550 --> 12:34.783
Corbin took care of it.

12:34.784 --> 12:36.384
- But how?
- I don't know.

12:37.037 --> 12:38.353
I don't remember.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.748
You've got all of his files. I'm sure
you have everything you need.

12:43.749 --> 12:45.665
Jenny, Macey is 13.

12:45.666 --> 12:48.267
That is younger than we were
when our worlds fell apart.

12:48.269 --> 12:49.968
No one was there for us.

12:50.548 --> 12:53.395
But we can be there for her.

12:57.831 --> 13:00.015
I wish I could help.
I'm sorry.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.927
(Birds chirping)

13:18.262 --> 13:22.010
Little Bean...
We are here.

13:22.011 --> 13:23.381
I'll get that.

13:24.748 --> 13:26.000
Okay.

13:35.128 --> 13:37.528
There we go.
(Grunts)

13:37.766 --> 13:41.381
Dad, where is here? I don't understand.
What are we doing here?

13:42.182 --> 13:44.856
Let's get you inside, okay?

13:44.955 --> 13:47.623
I told them to stock the place
with your favorite ice cream.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.342
- Which is...?
- All of them. (Chuckles)

13:50.350 --> 13:53.465
Go on. I'll be right in
to share a bowl.

13:53.615 --> 13:56.933
Jones, make sure
Macey gets set up.

13:57.858 --> 14:00.826
Hey. We're not
babysitting here.

14:00.827 --> 14:02.994
I need your A-game.
You up for this?

14:02.995 --> 14:04.995
Yes, sir. Sorry. I'm...

14:05.210 --> 14:06.476
I'm fine.

14:11.230 --> 14:14.399
I didn't wanna upset Macey
on the ride over.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.795
This is really serious,
isn't it?

14:17.244 --> 14:19.925
- Yes.
- Is it someone that you put away?

14:19.927 --> 14:22.153
I would love
to tell you everything, Cynthia.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.356
I'll be waiting.

14:27.156 --> 14:29.896
- Morales.
- Sir.

14:31.014 --> 14:32.381
Check the perimeter.

14:32.382 --> 14:34.977
We're not gonna let anything
get past us.

14:53.035 --> 14:55.928
I rather expected you
to have driven off by now.

14:56.858 --> 14:59.631
Me, too.
Damn thing won't start.

15:05.229 --> 15:06.830
(Chuckles)

15:06.831 --> 15:08.673
Sorry about the mess.

15:09.446 --> 15:11.567
Wasn't expecting company.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.518
Why must you and your sister
insist on keeping

15:14.519 --> 15:17.401
such a stockpile
of strange apparel?

15:17.793 --> 15:21.462
Says the man who wore
powdered wigs and stockings.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.866
I know this is difficult
for you.

15:27.902 --> 15:29.837
But we only have
until nightfall,

15:29.839 --> 15:32.873
and then the demon has warned
he will come for Macey.

15:36.077 --> 15:39.813
It started not long after
we saw Moloch in the woods.

15:40.153 --> 15:45.085
I'd have these spells,
where I'd lose time.

15:45.281 --> 15:48.608
I'd wake up somewhere and have
no idea how I'd gotten there.

15:49.451 --> 15:52.960
People would tell me about all
the things I'd said and done.

15:52.962 --> 15:54.328
(Roaring)

15:55.354 --> 15:56.930
Terrible things.

15:56.932 --> 16:00.300
You will die, August Corbin.

16:00.302 --> 16:05.331
- Unforgivable things.
- That you wanted to kill your sister.

16:05.708 --> 16:10.177
They assumed I was just another
troubled kid, and wrote me off.

16:10.839 --> 16:14.686
It tormented me.
Even after it was gone...

16:15.422 --> 16:19.238
I'd have these thoughts.
About Abbie.

16:19.594 --> 16:22.537
I didn't know why,
but I couldn't trust myself.

16:23.459 --> 16:25.526
So I'd break a law or two,

16:25.528 --> 16:28.962
get locked up
whenever I heard the voices.

16:28.964 --> 16:31.965
You would deliberately
have yourself arrested

16:31.967 --> 16:34.635
to avoid
harming your sister.

16:37.236 --> 16:39.538
And you never told her.

16:41.409 --> 16:45.280
- You were protecting her.
- You have no idea what it's like.

16:46.243 --> 16:51.246
This demon jumped from
one person to another

16:51.387 --> 16:54.588
to get to me, to use
me to do its bidding.

16:54.923 --> 16:59.326
Demon Jenny: <i>This vessel was chosen.
She has been marked.</i>

16:59.781 --> 17:03.030
Even when it wasn't inside me,
I had this...

17:03.790 --> 17:06.932
Sick feeling it was coming back.

17:08.589 --> 17:10.567
And now it has.

17:11.080 --> 17:15.821
We attempted to watch more of
the Sheriff's recording, but...

17:16.049 --> 17:18.732
It ends rather abruptly.

17:19.281 --> 17:22.883
Just as the demon charged you
with killing your sister,

17:22.885 --> 17:25.618
it may have charged someone else
with killing Macey.

17:26.377 --> 17:27.954
We need your help.

17:49.528 --> 17:51.211
He brought his priest.

17:53.781 --> 17:57.050
What's a priest supposed to do?
Get the perp to repent?

17:57.052 --> 17:59.119
People believe crazy things.

18:03.658 --> 18:05.125
(Inhales sharply)

18:08.930 --> 18:10.964
What do you think it is?

18:14.399 --> 18:16.709
I think it's... salt.

18:16.710 --> 18:20.273
It's a tool of the church to prevent
demons from crossing a threshold.

18:20.275 --> 18:22.843
(Scoffs)
This is all so...

18:22.845 --> 18:25.479
- Weird.
- Well, then move it.

18:30.194 --> 18:31.384
Thank you.

18:33.429 --> 18:34.829
(Grunting)

18:34.830 --> 18:35.930
Good-bye.

18:35.931 --> 18:37.464
(Neck cracks)

18:50.900 --> 18:52.234
(Roars)

18:52.891 --> 18:54.057
Got it.

18:55.362 --> 18:58.018
- Did you find something?
- The pause button.

18:58.635 --> 19:02.971
Mastering the remote.
You are officially a modern man.

19:02.973 --> 19:06.541
(Scoffs) Not in those rags.
You ever think about changing?

19:08.142 --> 19:10.744
If I may direct
your attention to this...

19:10.745 --> 19:14.012
White substance on the floor
encircling miss Jenny.

19:14.013 --> 19:16.580
I believe it's keeping
the demon restrained.

19:17.161 --> 19:19.096
(Roars)

19:22.612 --> 19:24.446
(Growling)

19:26.762 --> 19:28.430
Salt.

19:29.999 --> 19:33.302
I remember waking up, and
it was... all around me.

19:33.303 --> 19:35.203
And Corbin was there.

19:35.205 --> 19:37.038
I think we finally got him, kid.

19:38.154 --> 19:40.128
It's all over now.

19:40.559 --> 19:44.724
Crane: It seems salt can trap
the demon but not expel it.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.915
There must be something else
your Sheriff used.

19:48.549 --> 19:53.276
Corbin: "Truly, I tell you, if you have
faith the size of a mustard seed,"

19:53.300 --> 19:54.932
"you will say..."
(Speaking foreign language)

19:54.933 --> 19:57.192
The answer could lie
in the language the demon spoke.

19:57.194 --> 19:59.294
I can't identify it.

19:59.620 --> 20:02.681
Perhaps an...
Old dialect of Greek.

20:02.682 --> 20:06.201
There's a possible reference to Thanatos,
the Hellenic demon of death.

20:06.203 --> 20:07.794
No.

20:08.638 --> 20:10.105
Can you rewind it?

20:11.407 --> 20:12.807
Rewind it.

20:12.809 --> 20:15.410
Maybe we need to listen
to it in reverse.

20:18.098 --> 20:20.100
Demons have been known
to speak backwards.

20:20.101 --> 20:22.535
Just to up
the creep factor.

20:23.436 --> 20:25.337
Isolating the audio...

20:27.933 --> 20:29.926
Let's see if this works.

20:29.966 --> 20:32.499
(Speaking foreign language
on loop)

20:36.745 --> 20:40.735
Crane: Indeed it does.
That's ancient Aramaic.

20:43.506 --> 20:48.039
- "Ancitif cannot be defeated."
- Ancitif?

20:52.734 --> 20:54.178
"Ancitif..."

20:54.481 --> 20:58.277
"A powerful demon that has been known
to jump between bodies on contact."

20:58.278 --> 21:03.561
"First cited in 1647, when it possessed
a group of catholic nuns."

21:03.562 --> 21:07.263
So... this is the demon
that wanted me dead.

21:07.431 --> 21:09.664
Crane:
And likely still does.

21:11.123 --> 21:12.996
Ah, as we suspected,

21:12.997 --> 21:17.639
Ancitif is known to be a leader
of a legion of Moloch's minions.

21:17.641 --> 21:21.285
Fabled to have been sent
to destroy disciples.

21:21.286 --> 21:23.979
I suppose Irving could be
considered a disciple in a way.

21:23.981 --> 21:25.413
Did the nuns
defeat it?

21:25.415 --> 21:28.006
Apparently, using a blessed
lantern from the cathedral.

21:28.008 --> 21:32.206
"And the Lord's light shone true
and unmasked the wretched creature."

21:32.207 --> 21:35.711
"Cast from his vessel and
unable to cloak his true face,"

21:35.712 --> 21:37.845
"he was delivered
back into hell."

21:37.846 --> 21:39.631
Okay.

21:39.848 --> 21:43.867
So, a French lantern from
the time of Louis the 14th

21:43.868 --> 21:46.769
casts out the demon
from its host.

21:46.884 --> 21:48.414
Anyone up for a trip
to Paris?

21:48.415 --> 21:52.642
I don't believe we'll need to travel
so far. I recognize this lantern.

21:52.670 --> 21:54.976
I think I do, too.
How do you know it?

21:54.978 --> 21:57.646
Several were given
to Benjamin Franklin

21:57.648 --> 22:01.762
on one of his diplomatic
missions for the war effort.

22:02.168 --> 22:07.679
The French had allied with the Patriots
in 1778, supplying munitions,

22:07.680 --> 22:11.418
and, apparently,
devices for demonic exorcism.

22:11.528 --> 22:14.141
With the Revolution of their own
in the making,

22:14.142 --> 22:17.480
they clearly knew they had to defeat
evil on the American shores,

22:17.584 --> 22:19.893
or it would threaten
their own future.

22:21.037 --> 22:22.630
Where did you see it?

22:22.631 --> 22:26.032
Let's just say I know of one
still in the hands of Patriots,

22:26.033 --> 22:30.003
just not exactly the kind
Crane's familiar with.

22:38.287 --> 22:40.355
(Computer chirps)

22:53.747 --> 22:56.349
Want to play a board game?
I brought a few.

22:56.350 --> 22:58.545
Um... maybe
after I'm done.

22:58.546 --> 23:00.804
I'm applying to the advanced
science program.

23:00.805 --> 23:02.081
Really?

23:02.879 --> 23:06.244
- When did we decide this?
- A couple months ago.

23:06.245 --> 23:09.460
Macey has the highest
grades in her class.

23:09.461 --> 23:12.219
Oh, yeah? Pop quiz.

23:12.232 --> 23:15.917
- Einstein's Laws of Motion?
- You mean Newton's?

23:15.918 --> 23:17.126
Who? The fig guy?

23:17.127 --> 23:18.260
(Laughter)

23:18.335 --> 23:19.803
You're amazing, Bean.

23:19.804 --> 23:23.242
Thanks, dad, but I won't get in
if I don't nail this next test,

23:23.243 --> 23:25.685
- ...so I'm gonna go study in my room.
- Okay.

23:46.522 --> 23:48.590
(Door closes)

23:51.927 --> 23:54.429
They're after our
daughter, aren't they?

23:54.977 --> 23:57.140
Frank, I'm an attorney.

23:57.141 --> 23:59.611
I might be able to help
if you just let me.

23:59.643 --> 24:01.426
I didn't wanna worry you
with the details.

24:01.427 --> 24:04.829
You walk around with the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

24:05.046 --> 24:07.880
Why do you think that you
have to carry it alone?

24:08.015 --> 24:10.623
She did not get hurt
because you weren't there.

24:10.624 --> 24:13.348
- You have to know that.
- I do.

24:14.451 --> 24:16.718
- But this is...
- There's no buts.

24:17.542 --> 24:19.507
We were a team.

24:19.604 --> 24:21.842
But ever since
Macey's accident,

24:21.843 --> 24:25.233
you treat us both like we're broken
and you need to fix us.

24:26.448 --> 24:28.269
We're stronger than you think.

24:28.950 --> 24:32.386
How strong is your daughter?
Strong enough to fight for her soul?

24:32.388 --> 24:34.021
(Cell phone ringing)

24:37.070 --> 24:38.719
Take it.

24:52.774 --> 24:54.726
Tell me you have
something, Mills.

24:54.727 --> 24:57.729
Abbie: <i>We know the demon's name.
It's Ancitif.</i>

24:57.730 --> 25:01.174
And there's an ancient lantern
that will remove it from its host.

25:01.175 --> 25:03.889
How fast can you get here?
We are running out of time.

25:03.890 --> 25:05.886
- Working on it.
- I don't care what you have to do.

25:05.888 --> 25:07.054
Just get it here.

25:07.056 --> 25:08.455
(Phone beeps)

25:12.352 --> 25:14.793
Morales. What's going on?

25:14.794 --> 25:17.061
Demon voice:
<i>Sundown is upon us.</i>

25:17.899 --> 25:19.821
<i>You failed.</i>

25:29.314 --> 25:30.911
Morales?!

25:30.913 --> 25:32.045
Macey?!

25:32.047 --> 25:34.621
- Frank!
- Macey!

25:35.823 --> 25:39.112
(Panting) <i>Frank, the door is locked.
What's going on out there?</i>

25:40.555 --> 25:42.122
Macey:
<i>Daddy!</i>

25:45.752 --> 25:48.987
- Macey...?
- Demon Macey: Time's up... dad.

25:57.228 --> 26:00.294
You sure these people still have
one of those lanterns?

26:00.309 --> 26:03.033
100%. The Weavers are
End of Days fanatics.

26:03.035 --> 26:05.887
Meaning they believe
in the coming Armageddon.

26:05.888 --> 26:08.022
- Sensible folk.
- Not so much.

26:08.023 --> 26:09.440
I trained
with them for a while,

26:09.442 --> 26:13.390
helped them get their hands on some...
supplies, including that lantern.

26:13.391 --> 26:16.179
Knew it must do something interesting.
Just never knew what.

26:16.180 --> 26:20.609
By "supplies," you're referring
to guns and munitions.

26:20.610 --> 26:22.412
And they won't
hesitate to use them.

26:22.413 --> 26:24.112
Crane, remind me later
to have a chat

26:24.114 --> 26:25.380
about what your
founding friends

26:25.382 --> 26:28.083
were thinking when they crafted
our right to bear arms.

26:28.085 --> 26:34.059
True, there was concern among us that
it could lead to perverse consequences.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.701
Look, the good news is, I know exactly
where this lantern is locked up.

26:36.702 --> 26:38.582
And I know how to get to it
without riling them up.

26:38.583 --> 26:41.627
Jenny, you're not stealing anything.
You just got out of state custody.

26:42.398 --> 26:44.066
If you get caught,

26:44.068 --> 26:46.935
and they don't shoot you,
you're gonna end up in prison.

26:46.937 --> 26:49.719
- I know what I'm doing.
- So do I.

26:50.610 --> 26:53.818
Which is why
I'm going to steal it.

26:55.889 --> 26:59.848
Guess those social workers were right.
I really am a bad influence.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.654
O, dear God...

27:05.656 --> 27:07.389
(Roaring)

27:08.157 --> 27:11.426
We are united
in the dominion of good!

27:11.816 --> 27:14.629
You shall <i>not</i> defeat us!

27:14.631 --> 27:15.464
(Groans)

27:15.466 --> 27:17.056
Macey?!

27:17.057 --> 27:18.390
(Roaring)

27:18.391 --> 27:19.531
Daddy?

27:19.532 --> 27:22.667
(Whooshing)

27:22.765 --> 27:25.099
(Screaming, crackling)

27:25.109 --> 27:27.009
Daddy!

27:29.645 --> 27:33.081
(Roaring)

27:34.984 --> 27:37.786
Be gone, Satan!

27:38.959 --> 27:40.459
(Gurgled choking)

27:40.609 --> 27:42.409
(Neck cracks)

27:46.362 --> 27:47.911
Please...

27:48.365 --> 27:50.232
Give me back my daughter.

27:50.234 --> 27:53.248
She'll be yours again when
you deliver Washington's Bible.

27:53.249 --> 27:54.616
<i>Macey?!</i>

27:54.908 --> 27:56.205
Macey?

27:56.206 --> 27:58.974
Take me to the Bible.
Now!

27:59.431 --> 28:01.309
Oh, my God. Macey.

28:01.652 --> 28:03.358
- Frank, what's going on?!
- Cynthia!

28:03.359 --> 28:05.369
Or it's mommy next.

28:11.087 --> 28:13.355
(Phone ringing)

28:13.357 --> 28:14.689
Captain.

28:14.691 --> 28:18.160
Irving: <i>I'm sorry, but I'm out of options.
I got to give it what it wants.</i>

28:18.230 --> 28:19.494
Captain, no.

28:19.496 --> 28:22.231
<i>Is Washington's Bible
still at the archives?</i>

28:22.762 --> 28:24.026
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

28:24.027 --> 28:27.550
Please... sir.
Do not do this.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.890
<i>Stay... away.</i>

28:30.174 --> 28:31.274
(Line clicks)

28:31.954 --> 28:34.151
Jenny: Why would Irving
tell you he's going there?

28:34.152 --> 28:35.912
Why not just take
the Bible?

28:36.068 --> 28:38.513
He wants us to get there
in time to stop this.

28:38.515 --> 28:41.783
Irving knows the stakes of this war.
He wouldn't give in just for anything.

28:41.785 --> 28:44.586
Which means his daughter
is indeed in danger.

28:44.588 --> 28:48.496
Though, I doubt
from an outside host.

28:49.026 --> 28:50.725
In order to destroy
the Disciple,

28:50.727 --> 28:53.528
the demon would want
to use the ultimate motivator.

28:53.530 --> 28:55.597
Macey's been possessed.

28:55.599 --> 28:57.666
(Insects chirring)

29:00.412 --> 29:03.014
(Owl hooting)

29:03.015 --> 29:04.774
We're coming up
on the compound.

29:04.775 --> 29:08.710
Jenny: There's an open shed out back
where they park the pickups and ATVs.

29:09.967 --> 29:11.167
I got a visual.

29:11.169 --> 29:13.569
Make your way over and be careful.
There are trip wires everywhere.

29:13.571 --> 29:17.171
- The place is booby trapped.
- Sounds unpleasant.

29:17.631 --> 29:19.908
Just watch where you step.

29:22.012 --> 29:24.614
(Owl hooting)

29:27.017 --> 29:29.018
We're at the carport.

29:29.020 --> 29:31.791
The northwest overhang.
You see the camera?

29:31.792 --> 29:37.236
The moment it starts to turn, get
to the shed about 20 yards to the east.

29:37.510 --> 29:40.162
Move quickly; You'll only have about
eight seconds in its blind spot.

29:40.164 --> 29:41.731
Get ready to run.

29:49.172 --> 29:50.306
Now.

29:57.764 --> 29:59.382
We're at the door.

29:59.384 --> 30:01.267
Okay, take the tension wrench...

30:01.268 --> 30:03.786
I don't need you telling me
how to pick a lock.

30:03.788 --> 30:07.223
- I taught you, remember?
- Well, I continued my studies.

30:07.225 --> 30:08.325
(Grunts)

30:08.909 --> 30:11.142
Pretty sure
I just broke your record.

30:15.272 --> 30:17.248
I want a...
(Static hissing)

30:19.237 --> 30:20.770
Signal cut out.

30:21.248 --> 30:24.206
- That's funny.
- What?

30:24.776 --> 30:29.745
Your ceaseless quarreling only shows
how much you two care about one another.

30:30.306 --> 30:33.082
Just as you're committing
a felony to protect her,

30:33.084 --> 30:37.053
she committed crime after crime
solely to protect you.

30:37.441 --> 30:39.611
She got herself locked up
to stay away from me?

30:39.612 --> 30:43.259
Uh-huh. She was convinced
she may inadvertently harm you.

30:43.432 --> 30:46.246
She had to remand herself
in prison.

30:47.207 --> 30:49.374
Quite a sacrifice.

30:50.834 --> 30:52.902
One that kept me alive.

30:54.271 --> 30:56.973
All the more incentive
to vanquish this demon.

30:58.443 --> 30:59.677
Crane?

31:00.744 --> 31:01.944
Gonna need a hand.

31:02.213 --> 31:07.058
The irony being that your generation is
purportedly two inches taller than mine.

31:07.597 --> 31:10.188
- On average.
- Just grab the lantern.

31:17.179 --> 31:18.617
Mm.

31:21.587 --> 31:23.215
Oh. I'll hoist you up.

31:24.467 --> 31:25.801
Here.

31:25.803 --> 31:27.870
- Mm?
- Mm.

31:28.872 --> 31:30.272
(Exhales)

31:43.134 --> 31:45.170
(Quietly):
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

31:54.331 --> 31:55.798
(Guns click)

32:03.969 --> 32:07.185
Everybody stay calm.
I'm an officer of the Law.

32:07.187 --> 32:08.496
Badge or no badge,

32:08.497 --> 32:12.904
you got no right trespassing
and seizing our private property.

32:12.905 --> 32:14.652
- We know the law.
- Gentlemen...

32:14.653 --> 32:17.591
We don't wish to violate
your constitutional rights.

32:17.764 --> 32:21.600
- But we must commandeer this lantern.
- A child's life is at stake.

32:21.602 --> 32:25.103
- That's why we need it.
- Lot of lives at stake.

32:25.105 --> 32:26.805
That's why
<i>we</i> need the lantern.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.173
No.

32:29.427 --> 32:31.367
We're all just spiders.

32:31.612 --> 32:36.409
You. Me. Everyone.
Dangling over the pit of hell.

32:36.410 --> 32:41.987
And at any moment, any one
of us could fall into the fire.

32:41.989 --> 32:44.331
Jonathan Edwards.

32:44.445 --> 32:47.904
"Sinners in the Hands
of an Angry God."

32:48.294 --> 32:51.730
- You know your sermons.
- Mr. Weaver... (Guns click)

32:54.333 --> 32:59.070
Mr. Weaver, I can confirm
what you might already suspect.

32:59.072 --> 33:03.373
The war between Good and Evil
has resumed in Sleepy Hollow.

33:03.374 --> 33:08.487
At this precise moment, Evil
is threatening to claim a young girl.

33:08.782 --> 33:11.249
She could be one of the first
victims of the war

33:11.251 --> 33:15.773
that we can end if we defeat them now,
before they grow stronger.

33:16.275 --> 33:17.875
Which is why...

33:17.903 --> 33:22.905
We require this particular lantern.
I'm begging you.

33:23.096 --> 33:26.035
Don't let that girl
fall into the fire.

33:26.726 --> 33:29.835
Every moment we linger
could hasten the end

33:29.836 --> 33:32.437
you're so diligently
trying to avoid.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.850
Put down the lantern
and get off my property.

33:45.852 --> 33:49.310
Or I swear, I'll show you
the door to hell myself.

33:49.311 --> 33:51.718
Jenny:
Not if I show you first.

33:53.793 --> 33:54.893
(Laughs)

33:54.895 --> 33:56.398
Jenny Mills.

33:56.548 --> 33:59.245
Love to catch up,
Chase, but we're leaving now.

33:59.246 --> 34:02.333
If for no other reason than
you know I'm the best shot here.

34:02.335 --> 34:06.738
When we're done with the lantern,
you have my word, we will return it.

34:08.393 --> 34:10.574
Never could
say no to you.

34:15.741 --> 34:18.858
You may break in quicker,
but I'm better at breaking out.

34:18.985 --> 34:20.344
Noted.

34:34.456 --> 34:38.259
It was here. This is where
they keep Washington's Bible, I swear.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.487
Abbie and Crane
must have taken it.

34:42.513 --> 34:44.292
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

34:44.318 --> 34:47.757
You always fight other
people's battles, Disciple.

34:47.757 --> 34:51.126
And every time you do,
your family suffers.

34:51.530 --> 34:54.437
You cost your daughter her legs.

34:55.612 --> 34:58.008
- That's not true.
- Frank...

34:58.070 --> 35:01.438
What does this all mean?
Where's our baby girl?

35:02.065 --> 35:03.232
Daddy.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.613
Macey.

35:09.216 --> 35:11.666
Macey, I know you're
still in there.

35:12.432 --> 35:14.867
And I need you to fight.

35:16.174 --> 35:18.626
Sweetheart, I was wrong.

35:19.677 --> 35:22.512
I was so angry over
what happened to you,

35:22.514 --> 35:25.459
I didn't think it would
ever be okay again.

35:26.857 --> 35:28.610
I wanted to make it better.

35:29.253 --> 35:31.062
To fix you.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.839
But you don't
need fixing.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.305
You're strong.

35:39.230 --> 35:41.297
Just like your mother.

35:44.401 --> 35:45.701
Macey:
Daddy...

35:47.044 --> 35:48.377
Macey.

35:48.863 --> 35:51.121
Can you hear me,
baby girl?

35:53.238 --> 35:56.112
(Gasps) Demon voice: Macey
is never coming back.

35:56.114 --> 35:57.480
Let her go!

36:08.082 --> 36:11.151
Jennifer Mills.

36:11.687 --> 36:15.598
Seven years ago,
I invaded you.

36:15.600 --> 36:19.451
That was a long time ago.
This is a new day.

36:19.452 --> 36:21.191
Where is your sister?

36:21.192 --> 36:25.989
It must be so hard to see her, knowing
for so long you wanted her dead.

36:26.395 --> 36:28.805
Or do you still have
evil thoughts?

36:31.815 --> 36:33.646
She got rid of you once.

36:33.997 --> 36:36.833
Now... We're gonna
send you back to hell again.

36:36.834 --> 36:38.166
(Growls)

36:41.991 --> 36:44.547
Hand over the Bible, Witness.

36:44.548 --> 36:48.583
Or I will take your sister when
I'm through with this vessel.

36:48.584 --> 36:53.181
- You will never take me again.
- I know you feel it.

36:53.228 --> 36:56.661
The darkness
within your soul...

36:56.682 --> 36:59.853
Whispering in your ear.

36:59.854 --> 37:03.106
Telling you
you must kill your sister.

37:03.107 --> 37:05.391
Never again, Ancitif.

37:05.727 --> 37:09.085
The days of you tormenting my sister...
they're over.

37:09.087 --> 37:10.469
(Growls)

37:10.852 --> 37:12.570
You're a coward.

37:12.982 --> 37:15.277
Why do you prey
on children?

37:15.625 --> 37:17.222
Try me.

37:17.696 --> 37:18.929
Come on.

37:18.931 --> 37:23.203
Witness, we have much more
in store for you.

37:23.204 --> 37:25.694
Abbie: What are you waiting for?
I'm right here.

37:25.921 --> 37:27.655
(Hissing)

37:34.456 --> 37:37.837
- You can't touch us.
- Heard you're not a fan of salt.

37:38.007 --> 37:39.407
Or lanterns.

37:41.431 --> 37:43.833
(Hissing, cracking)
And the Lord's light shone true

37:43.834 --> 37:47.014

the wretched creature.

Cast from his vessel,
and unable to cloak his true face.

37:53.523 --> 37:58.127
Our plan is in motion.
The Witnesses can't stop it.

37:58.128 --> 38:00.854
Darkness will reign.

38:00.855 --> 38:04.923
Ancitif will be delivered
back to hell!

It's gonna be okay,
I promise.
