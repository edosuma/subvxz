Oh, God, the world
is ugly in the morning.

01:22.502 --> 01:23.968
Oh, Al.
It's our anniversary

01:24.003 --> 01:26.501
and the kids wanted
to fix us breakfast.

01:26.536 --> 01:28.000
Yeah, they're
great kids.

01:28.035 --> 01:30.000
By the way,
happy anniversary.

01:30.035 --> 01:33.000
Did you brush
your teeth this morning?

01:33.035 --> 01:34.501
No. You?

01:34.536 --> 01:36.400
No.

01:36.435 --> 01:37.701
Happy anniversary, honey.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.267
I could eat a horse.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.767
Me too.
I'm hungry.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.767
I don't smell
anything cooking.

01:44.802 --> 01:46.767
I don't see
anything cooking.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.868
I'm gonna go out
on a limb here-

01:48.903 --> 01:50.701
Nothing's cooking.

01:50.736 --> 01:53.300
I bet they made
something ahead of time

01:53.335 --> 01:55.100
and they're hiding.

01:55.135 --> 01:57.467
Ready to surprise us.

01:57.502 --> 01:58.801
Oh.

01:58.836 --> 02:00.968
I'm starving.
What's for breakfast?

02:01.003 --> 02:02.467
Kids!
It's our anniversary.

02:02.502 --> 02:04.901
I thought you wanted
to get up early

02:04.936 --> 02:06.000
and fix us breakfast?

02:06.035 --> 02:08.267
Oh, no.
Was that today?

02:08.301 --> 02:09.701
Uh-huh.

02:09.735 --> 02:11.400
I'm sorry.

02:11.435 --> 02:13.400
Happy anniversary.

02:13.435 --> 02:15.267
What's
for breakfast?

02:15.302 --> 02:18.267
I'll fix us something.
What would you like?

02:18.302 --> 02:21.267
I'd like some
fried eggs over easy,

02:21.302 --> 02:24.267
I'd like couple of pieces
of crisp bacon,

02:24.302 --> 02:26.767
I'd like a glass
of fresh juice, squeezed,

02:26.802 --> 02:30.267
and I'd like a couple of pieces
of toast with jam.

02:30.302 --> 02:31.667
Where's the Tang?

02:35.067 --> 02:37.734
You are so immature.

02:40.667 --> 02:42.667
Bud, stop playing
with your clothes.

02:44.467 --> 02:46.534
Well anyway,
happy anniversary, dear.

02:46.569 --> 02:49.100
Can you believe
it's been 16 years?

02:49.135 --> 02:51.467
Yeah, they just
flew by.

02:51.502 --> 02:54.801
Let's see,
now which one is the 16th?

02:54.836 --> 02:58.133
I know the 10th is tin.

02:58.168 --> 02:59.801
The 15th is crystal.

02:59.836 --> 03:01.467
What's the next one?

03:01.502 --> 03:02.634
Brimstone.

03:03.968 --> 03:06.501
Gonna get me
a tie again?

03:06.536 --> 03:07.734
Yeah.

03:07.769 --> 03:09.100
Getting me shoes?

03:09.135 --> 03:10.234
Yeah.

03:10.269 --> 03:11.567
From your store?

03:11.602 --> 03:12.901
Yup.

03:12.936 --> 03:16.033
Why don't we just forget
about presents this year?

03:16.068 --> 03:17.400
Fine with me.

03:17.435 --> 03:20.033
I mean, after all, anniversaries
are about being together.

03:20.068 --> 03:21.267
Yeah, you're right.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.767
I'll come home tonight.
How's that?

03:24.200 --> 03:26.801
Yeah, I'll be here,
you'll be here,

03:26.836 --> 03:28.200
the TV will be here.

03:28.235 --> 03:30.901
Let's not make a big deal
about it this year, all right?

03:30.936 --> 03:32.968
Yeah. We don't need
a bunch of silly presents

03:33.003 --> 03:35.467
to show we love
each other.

03:35.502 --> 03:37.434
I know that I love you.

03:37.469 --> 03:38.934
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.434
I said that I love you.

03:40.469 --> 03:43.334
I said yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got to get ready for work.

03:43.369 --> 03:45.868
Listen, Al, since you're not
gonna get me a present,

03:45.903 --> 03:47.534
do you think you could
take my car

03:47.569 --> 03:48.868
and have a radio installed?

03:48.903 --> 03:50.534
Peg, I don't have the time.

03:50.569 --> 03:52.868
Yeah, but I'm out all day long,
you know, running errands.

03:52.903 --> 03:54.667
What am I supposed
to listen to?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.167
Your own
beautiful voice.

03:56.202 --> 03:59.033
If God didn't want
other people to hear it,

03:59.068 --> 04:00.968
he wouldn't
have made it so shrill.

04:01.003 --> 04:02.901
I'm going
to take a shower.

04:02.936 --> 04:04.501
Yeah, I gotta do the laundry.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.734
When you do the laundry,
you use all the hot water.

04:06.769 --> 04:09.601
If God had wanted you
to have hot water,

04:09.636 --> 04:12.534
he wouldn't have
given me laundry.

04:12.569 --> 04:17.000
Dad, are you really not
gonna get Mom a present?

04:17.035 --> 04:21.434
Whoo, bad move.
No matter what she says,

04:21.469 --> 04:22.834
if you don't
get her a present,

04:22.869 --> 04:24.400
you're gonna break her heart.

04:24.435 --> 04:27.234
Yeah. Then she'll
take it out on us.

04:27.269 --> 04:30.501
Dad, even Meg's father got
her mom an anniversary present,

04:30.536 --> 04:32.367
and he shot at her.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
This is a secret.
And I mean a secret.

04:37.035 --> 04:39.501
I am getting
your mom a present-

04:39.536 --> 04:41.501
One of those
expensive watches

04:41.536 --> 04:43.934
she's always
harping about.

04:43.969 --> 04:46.968
Oh, Dad, that's great. She'll
love it, you're the greatest.

04:47.003 --> 04:48.968
Yeah, but listen, don't say
a word to your mother.

04:49.003 --> 04:50.767
Because I want this to be
a surprise, understand?

04:50.802 --> 04:51.968
Not a word.

04:52.003 --> 04:53.934
Right, Dad.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.467
Oh, Mom, guess what?

04:59.502 --> 05:01.033
Dad's getting
you a great watch.

05:01.068 --> 05:05.934
That is supposed
to be a surprise, butthead.

05:05.969 --> 05:07.367
It's one of those
expensive ones

05:07.402 --> 05:08.367
that you're always
harping about.

05:08.402 --> 05:10.067
Ohh...

05:10.102 --> 05:12.868
What a sweet man.

05:14.234 --> 05:18.267
Yeah, that sweet man
would get me a great gift,

05:18.302 --> 05:20.834
and I'll be sitting there like
a jerk with nothing for him.

05:20.869 --> 05:24.267
Well, I'm gonna go out
and get him something.

05:24.302 --> 05:26.634
What is it
he's really wanting?

05:26.669 --> 05:28.801
That blond
down the street.

05:30.834 --> 05:32.634
Did he tell you that?

05:32.669 --> 05:34.033
No, I just
assumed it

05:34.068 --> 05:35.434
by the way
he bites his fist

05:35.469 --> 05:38.834
whenever he
drives by her house.

05:38.869 --> 05:40.567
He's just kidding
when he does that.

05:40.602 --> 05:43.133
Excuse me. One second.

05:45.934 --> 05:47.534
Aah!

05:50.367 --> 05:52.000
Oh, I'm just kidding
when I do that.

05:52.035 --> 05:53.801
You kids go ahead
and get ready for school.

05:55.767 --> 05:57.100
Aah!

05:58.269 --> 06:01.601
Sorry, Al.
I had a huge load of laundry.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.033
Happy anniversary!
Happy anniversary!

06:09.068 --> 06:11.167
Ohh, how thoughtful!

06:11.202 --> 06:14.400
Look, we even put your name
on the label.

06:14.435 --> 06:15.767
Oh, that's too bad.

06:15.802 --> 06:18.000
It would have been nice gift
for us to give somebody,

06:18.035 --> 06:19.567
but thanks anyway.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.067
So...

06:23.102 --> 06:25.267
I guess you guys have
a big evening planned, huh?

06:25.302 --> 06:26.767
Oh, pretty much.

06:26.802 --> 06:29.100
I'll fix dinner.
We'll exchange presents.

06:29.135 --> 06:30.968
Then he'll watch
midget wrestling.

06:31.003 --> 06:33.000
Ooh. What time
does it come on?

06:33.035 --> 06:35.601
Steve! We hate wrestling.

06:35.636 --> 06:38.534
I know. I just
want to know

06:38.569 --> 06:42.167
how late midgets
got to stay up.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.167
Now, Peggy...

06:43.202 --> 06:46.067
This is a special
night for you.

06:46.102 --> 06:47.868
And you shouldn't
spend it cooking.

06:47.903 --> 06:50.367
Listen. I know
a great caterer.

06:50.402 --> 06:52.167
Let them do the work.

06:52.202 --> 06:53.367
A caterer?

06:53.402 --> 06:56.334
Yeah. We use them
for all our anniversaries.

06:56.369 --> 06:58.467
The first day we met.

06:58.502 --> 06:59.868
First day we kissed.

06:59.903 --> 07:02.467
The first day
we went out.

07:02.502 --> 07:04.734
The first day
we stayed in.

07:04.769 --> 07:06.767
The first day
you brought me flowers.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.367
The first day you
talked dirty to me.

07:08.402 --> 07:09.367
I love you, Steve.

07:09.402 --> 07:10.901
I love you too,
Marcie.

07:16.901 --> 07:18.267
Do they make veal?

07:20.734 --> 07:21.868
Here we are, sir.

07:21.903 --> 07:23.567
Oh, I think my wife
would like that.

07:23.602 --> 07:25.767
I think she will too,
it's a very nice frame and-

07:25.802 --> 07:28.734
I'm Al Bundy. I called
about that expensive watch.

07:28.769 --> 07:30.734
Ah, yes.

07:30.769 --> 07:32.267
Here you are, sir.

07:32.302 --> 07:33.767
It's my last one.

07:33.802 --> 07:35.767
Well, wrap it up, and...

07:35.802 --> 07:37.634
Leave the price tag on.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.601
Well, yes, sir.

07:40.636 --> 07:43.133
Will that be
cash or charge?

07:43.168 --> 07:44.934
Charge, and, uh...

07:44.969 --> 07:47.133
Don't get cute
with my carbons.

07:49.501 --> 07:52.367
Wait a second.
I was here first.

07:52.402 --> 07:54.234
Yeah. So were
the Indians.

07:55.534 --> 07:57.033
See, I'm in sales myself.

07:57.068 --> 07:59.033
I know how
these guys think.

07:59.068 --> 08:01.868
They see me,
they see a big commission.

08:01.903 --> 08:04.300
They see you,
they see me.

08:04.335 --> 08:06.467
Well, if you're in sales
you should know

08:06.502 --> 08:08.601
each customer counts
as much as the next.

08:08.636 --> 08:11.200
Yeah right, that's why he let
me butt right in front of you

08:11.235 --> 08:12.534
like you were never born.

08:12.569 --> 08:14.434
What's that?

08:14.469 --> 08:17.033
It's an anniversary
present for my wife.

08:17.068 --> 08:18.400
You gonna get that?

08:18.435 --> 08:19.400
Yeah.

08:19.435 --> 08:20.601
How many years
you been married?

08:20.636 --> 08:22.734
One.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.734
Well, see, that explains it.

08:24.769 --> 08:27.133
See, you're obviously new
to the married game.

08:27.168 --> 08:28.467
Let me help you out.

08:28.502 --> 08:31.901
See, the first thing I learned
on my 16-year tour of duty

08:31.936 --> 08:35.234
was that women
live for presents.

08:35.269 --> 08:37.534
Now you take the most ornery
woman in the world.

08:37.568 --> 08:39.801
We'll call her...Peggy.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.967
You bring
a crappy present home,

08:44.003 --> 08:47.667
like, uh...
that picture frame,

08:47.702 --> 08:50.534
and your life
will be a living hell.

08:50.569 --> 08:52.567
Well, my wife
and I agreed

08:52.602 --> 08:55.434
we wouldn't spend too much
on our anniversary.

08:55.469 --> 08:58.400
We decided we'd save our money
for more important things.

08:58.435 --> 09:01.601
There is no more important thing
than your anniversary.

09:01.636 --> 09:04.400
See, an anniversary
is something special.

09:04.435 --> 09:06.200
It's not like
other holidays

09:06.235 --> 09:08.501
when other people
are celebrating too.

09:08.536 --> 09:10.701
It's just between
the two of you.

09:10.736 --> 09:13.801
See, it's a day
when you can show

09:13.836 --> 09:16.501
how you feel the rest
of the year,

09:16.536 --> 09:19.167
but you don't,
because you're a man.

09:20.968 --> 09:22.634
That's beautiful.

09:22.669 --> 09:24.267
To know me is to love me.

09:26.133 --> 09:29.133
Here comes
how I feel right now.

09:29.168 --> 09:31.133
Sir, your card's
been rejected.

09:31.168 --> 09:32.300
Why?

09:32.335 --> 09:35.033
I don't care. Next.

09:35.068 --> 09:36.534
Wait a second.
It's my anniversary.

09:36.569 --> 09:37.968
Happy anniversary.

09:38.003 --> 09:39.033
Next.

09:39.068 --> 09:40.400
I'll take the watch.

09:45.801 --> 09:48.901
Wow, I wish I could make
stuff like that.

09:48.936 --> 09:51.968
Maybe you can.
Would like to be a chef?

09:52.003 --> 09:54.467
No, I'd rather
be a man.

10:05.033 --> 10:06.367
Don't touch my rosin.

10:06.402 --> 10:08.601
Don't ever touch my rosin.

10:08.636 --> 10:10.601
Sorry.

10:10.636 --> 10:12.534
Gee, you're kind of touchy.

10:12.569 --> 10:14.534
Kind of like a clown
at a birthday party.

10:14.569 --> 10:17.234
Yeah? You ever see
a clown do this?

10:17.269 --> 10:19.467
Ow!

10:19.502 --> 10:20.634
Bobo!

10:20.669 --> 10:22.667
Shut up. I'm not
doing that anymore.

10:28.434 --> 10:29.734
Peggy.

10:29.769 --> 10:32.200
What a beautiful dress.

10:32.235 --> 10:34.767
Thanks. I bought it
this afternoon.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.133
I didn't really like it,

10:36.168 --> 10:39.100
but I didn't feel like changing
back into what I had on.

10:39.135 --> 10:41.701
We were just admiring
your wedding album.

10:41.736 --> 10:43.534
We videotaped
our wedding.

10:43.569 --> 10:45.934
Of course, Polaroids
are nice too.

10:47.536 --> 10:49.100
That's Daddy's car.

10:49.135 --> 10:51.667
Okay, that's my watch.
Everyone hide, quick.

10:51.702 --> 10:54.000
In there.
Go on, go on.

10:58.801 --> 11:01.334
Happy anniversary, honey!

11:01.369 --> 11:03.234
See what Steve
and Marcie sent us?

11:03.269 --> 11:05.033
Yeah, gee,
that's great.

11:06.634 --> 11:09.067
As long as I don't have
to put with them in person.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.367
Surprise!
Surprise!

11:11.402 --> 11:14.000
Happy anniversary!

11:14.035 --> 11:15.734
Peg, I thought
we said no big deal.

11:15.769 --> 11:17.133
Oh, it's not big deal.

11:17.168 --> 11:19.634
It's just us and a few
of our closest friends.

11:26.534 --> 11:27.968
And a violinist.

11:28.003 --> 11:29.634
And a few others.

11:29.669 --> 11:30.801
Time for presents.

11:30.836 --> 11:33.133
Peg, I thought
we said no presents.

11:33.168 --> 11:35.200
Well, I know, but it's our
anniversary.

11:35.235 --> 11:38.000
And I couldn't resist.

11:38.035 --> 11:39.133
You didn't tell
your mom

11:39.168 --> 11:40.968
I was gonna get
her a present, did you?

11:41.003 --> 11:42.868
It was Kelly, Dad.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.634
I know she's your daughter,

11:44.669 --> 11:47.167
but I think she's got to go.

11:48.734 --> 11:52.267
Okay, Mom and Dad,
open mine first.

11:52.302 --> 11:54.567
You brought me
a present too?

11:54.602 --> 11:57.634
Sure, I wasn't gonna be the only
one here without a present.

12:04.033 --> 12:07.000
Ooh.

12:09.634 --> 12:11.400
A picture frame.

12:11.435 --> 12:12.834
Do you know
how much it cost?

12:12.869 --> 12:14.267
Yes, I do.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.834
The perfect
anniversary gift.

12:17.869 --> 12:19.767
Mine next.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.267
Oh... A diary.

12:25.302 --> 12:28.868
Yeah. It's Kelly's.

12:30.334 --> 12:33.868
I heard you say you'd give
anything to take a look at it.

12:33.903 --> 12:35.701
You little wad!

12:35.736 --> 12:36.834
You thief!

12:36.869 --> 12:40.601
You little Nazi
fascist psychopath!

12:40.636 --> 12:42.200
Mom, can I have
that back please?

12:42.235 --> 12:44.133
Of course, dear.

12:44.168 --> 12:45.601
They're your
private moments,

12:45.636 --> 12:47.501
and Bud had
no right to take it.

12:47.536 --> 12:51.834
It was a nice thought,
though, Bud.

12:51.869 --> 12:54.767
You open wound!

12:54.802 --> 12:57.167
Here, we got you two

12:57.202 --> 12:58.801
one of our favorite books.

12:58.836 --> 13:02.100
<i>My Partner,
My Wife, My Life.</i>

13:03.667 --> 13:06.400
My God.

13:06.435 --> 13:08.200
Well, that's all
for the presents.

13:08.235 --> 13:09.467
Thank you very much.

13:09.502 --> 13:10.834
Good night,
and drive safely.

13:10.869 --> 13:13.567
No! It's my turn.

13:13.602 --> 13:16.267
Peg, were you here this morning
when we said no presents?

13:16.302 --> 13:18.934
Oh, Al.

13:22.033 --> 13:23.300
Here!

13:26.000 --> 13:28.067
Ohh.

13:34.834 --> 13:37.701
Ooh!

13:39.000 --> 13:43.501
The power tools
I've been wanting.

13:43.536 --> 13:45.801
Boy, it's going to be
tough to top this.

13:45.836 --> 13:47.534
So why try?

13:47.569 --> 13:49.667
Good night, everybody!

13:49.702 --> 13:51.501
We all know what
it's time for now.

13:51.536 --> 13:53.934
Yeah, come on, Dad.
Whip out that watch.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.801
Ah! The door!

13:58.634 --> 14:00.567
Luke, you're here.

14:00.602 --> 14:01.834
Look, everybody,
it's Luke,

14:01.869 --> 14:03.033
and he doesn't
have a present,

14:03.068 --> 14:05.934
but we're not going to hold
it against him, are we?

14:05.969 --> 14:08.934
I'd have to be a pretty big
piece of scum

14:08.969 --> 14:10.601
not to bring
a present.

14:12.133 --> 14:14.667
You didn't have
to bring a present.

14:14.702 --> 14:17.701
Yes, I did, Al.
Peg hates me.

14:19.968 --> 14:22.667
Thank you, Luke.

14:22.702 --> 14:26.100
Hey, Al, your daughter's
really blossomed.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.400
Where's the eats?

14:32.435 --> 14:33.567
Not now, Luke.

14:33.602 --> 14:35.901
We still have one more thing
we have to do.

14:35.936 --> 14:37.734
Yeah, Dad.
Get Mom's present.

14:37.769 --> 14:39.234
Right. Right.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.567
Uhh...

14:40.602 --> 14:42.234
It's out in the car.
I'll go get it.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.334
Happy anniversary!

15:05.534 --> 15:06.868
A can of motor oil.

15:06.903 --> 15:07.968
40-weight.

15:08.003 --> 15:09.100
And, uh...

15:09.135 --> 15:13.400
A road flare.

15:13.435 --> 15:15.968
Bless our happy home.

15:22.234 --> 15:23.801
You didn't
get her anything, huh?

15:23.836 --> 15:26.234
I tried to get her
a watch, but...

15:26.269 --> 15:28.467
Who is this guy?

15:28.502 --> 15:31.501
That's Bobo.

15:33.501 --> 15:35.300
Peg, I tried
to get you the watch.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.501
There was some kind of a mix-up
with the credit card.

15:37.536 --> 15:38.834
I'll fix it tomorrow.

15:38.869 --> 15:41.033
Tomorrow is not
our anniversary.

15:41.068 --> 15:42.534
You're taking this well.

15:42.569 --> 15:45.501
Well, gifts aren't really
important, are they?

15:45.536 --> 15:46.767
The important thing

15:46.802 --> 15:49.000
is that you've been
together all these years.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.567
Isn't that what anniversaries
are all about?

15:51.602 --> 15:53.901
Steve, you would
never show up

15:53.936 --> 15:55.968
without a present
for our anniversary, would you?

15:56.003 --> 15:58.934
Of course not.
I care about you.

15:58.969 --> 16:02.300
Dinner is served!

16:02.335 --> 16:05.434
Maybe we ought
to be getting on home.

16:05.469 --> 16:07.801
Oh no, you don't.
I paid for this dinner,

16:07.836 --> 16:09.267
and I'm going
to enjoy it.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.167
Now sit down.

16:12.367 --> 16:13.767
Nice going, Dad.

16:13.802 --> 16:16.133
Yeah, Dad. Nice.

16:23.934 --> 16:25.667
You know, Peg,
I really tried-

16:25.702 --> 16:28.834
I don't want to hear
anymore about it.

16:28.869 --> 16:29.834
Caviar, anyone?

16:29.869 --> 16:32.567
Bud, Kelly, Steve?

16:32.602 --> 16:37.634
Marcie, Luke?

16:37.669 --> 16:39.968
You know, Peg I tried
to get you the watch.

16:40.003 --> 16:40.968
It's not my fault.

16:41.003 --> 16:42.234
It's never your fault.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.701
There's gotta be a reason.
I paid the bill.

16:44.736 --> 16:47.734
You were here, I sent the check
in a couple weeks ago.

16:47.769 --> 16:48.734
Give it up, Al.

16:48.769 --> 16:50.267
There's nothing wrong
with the card.

16:50.302 --> 16:54.934
I've used it to pay
for this dinner today...

16:54.969 --> 16:58.634
Including this caviar, which
you now have your elbow in.

16:58.669 --> 17:01.133
Well, there's gotta
be some reason.

17:01.168 --> 17:02.901
I've got one.
You're cheap.

17:02.936 --> 17:04.467
Yeah, but not today.

17:04.502 --> 17:07.467
I mean, didn't the guy give you
a hard time about the card?

17:07.502 --> 17:08.968
No, Al. Not at all.

17:09.002 --> 17:11.133
Me, neither,
Daddy.

17:11.167 --> 17:12.901
You paid with the
credit card too?

17:12.935 --> 17:17.300
Of course, I wasn't
going to spend my allowance.

17:17.335 --> 17:19.067
And Peg, sweetie,

17:19.102 --> 17:22.601
those power tools
that cost a pretty penny,

17:22.636 --> 17:25.567
was that pretty
penny plastic, Peg?

17:25.602 --> 17:26.800
Of course it was, Al.

17:26.836 --> 17:28.467
I see.

17:28.502 --> 17:33.367
So I guess the dinner
and the presents...

17:33.402 --> 17:39.434
Old Mr. Skinflint here kind of
paid for everything, didn't he?

17:39.469 --> 17:41.334
In fact, the only thing
I didn't pay for

17:41.369 --> 17:43.334
was my present to you,
and you wanna know why?

17:43.369 --> 17:46.634
Because maybe you stuffed
the credit card so much,

17:46.669 --> 17:50.067
that when I tried
to use it, it threw up.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.801
Blecch!

17:55.133 --> 17:56.434
No, no, no!

17:56.469 --> 17:59.534
Eat. Enjoy. Relax.

17:59.569 --> 18:01.033
I'd like
to thank everybody

18:01.068 --> 18:05.234
for their understanding
in my hour of need.

18:05.269 --> 18:07.434
I'm going
to take my tools,

18:07.469 --> 18:08.434
which I paid for,

18:08.469 --> 18:10.868
and celebrate
in the garage,

18:10.903 --> 18:12.467
which I'm
still paying for.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.734
Would you pass
the veal?

18:23.769 --> 18:26.367
You know, Peggy,

18:26.402 --> 18:27.534
as a woman,

18:27.569 --> 18:29.701
I never thought I would say
this to another woman,

18:29.736 --> 18:31.934
but you're totally wrong.

18:31.969 --> 18:34.767
I know.

18:34.802 --> 18:35.901
Aren't you
going to apologize?

18:35.936 --> 18:38.467
Well sure,
but not right now.

18:38.502 --> 18:40.067
He won't be
expecting me yet.

18:40.102 --> 18:44.033
See, this is where he likes me
to stew in my own juices.

18:44.068 --> 18:46.634
Could you pass
the sauce?

18:46.669 --> 18:48.834
But you are going to tell him
you're sorry, aren't you?

18:48.869 --> 18:50.234
Ha! No.

18:50.269 --> 18:52.334
You know, that's
the really nice thing about Al.

18:52.369 --> 18:54.534
Whenever we have
a major argument,

18:54.569 --> 18:56.300
he never makes
me apologize.

18:56.335 --> 18:57.901
He always always
cuts me off right before

18:57.936 --> 19:00.400
I have to say the S-word.

19:00.435 --> 19:01.968
It's sort of a shorthand.

19:02.003 --> 19:03.400
It comes
with 16 years of marriage.

19:03.435 --> 19:06.367
Aw, honey, I hope that we grow
so close that I never have

19:06.402 --> 19:07.801
to apologize to you.

19:07.836 --> 19:08.834
Steve, you're interrupting.

19:08.869 --> 19:10.467
I'm sorry.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.734
And another thing,
where did you get that dress?

19:22.769 --> 19:25.300
I've had this
for years.

19:25.335 --> 19:29.501
You never notice
what I wear.

19:31.467 --> 19:32.934
What are you
doing out here?

19:32.969 --> 19:35.334
You know.

19:35.369 --> 19:36.567
Look,
I didn't realize

19:36.602 --> 19:38.534
that I put you
over your credit limit.

19:38.569 --> 19:40.133
That's just one
of those things that happen

19:40.168 --> 19:42.567
when you charge
too much.

19:42.602 --> 19:43.567
And?

19:43.602 --> 19:46.067
And after all,
it's your money.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.334
And?

19:47.369 --> 19:48.834
And I don't work.

19:48.869 --> 19:51.067
Feel free to cut me off here
anytime you like.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.067
Not this time,

19:52.102 --> 19:53.934
because I didn't
do anything.

19:53.969 --> 19:55.701
And I want to hear
you say it.

19:55.736 --> 19:56.934
What, Al?

19:56.969 --> 19:59.801
It.

19:59.836 --> 20:03.934
Come on, Al.
We both know I am.

20:03.969 --> 20:06.667
Am what, Peg?

20:06.702 --> 20:08.567
It.

20:08.602 --> 20:10.434
Very it.

20:12.734 --> 20:14.367
You're
really serious.

20:14.402 --> 20:15.801
Yep.

20:15.836 --> 20:18.501
You see, I thought I finally
saved up enough money

20:18.536 --> 20:21.200
to get you a nice present
that you deserve.

20:21.235 --> 20:24.534
I felt bad walking
in the house without it,

20:24.569 --> 20:28.501
but it was worse thinking
you didn't think I tried.

20:31.067 --> 20:32.767
Yeah. You're right.

20:32.802 --> 20:33.968
You always
do try to do

20:34.003 --> 20:36.234
something nice
for our anniversary.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.767
Mm-hmm.

20:37.802 --> 20:40.801
And even if you hadn't tried
to buy me that watch,

20:40.836 --> 20:42.968
if the 16 years
we've been together

20:43.003 --> 20:44.667
isn't enough to say
"I love you,"

20:44.702 --> 20:48.200
well, what good would
a stupid watch do?

20:49.868 --> 20:51.667
Oh, Al.

20:51.702 --> 20:52.701
I really-

20:52.736 --> 20:56.701
We're supposed
to get some rain.

20:59.868 --> 21:01.300
Would you like me
to make soup

21:01.335 --> 21:03.067
for your lunch
tomorrow?

21:03.102 --> 21:04.067
Naw, that's okay.

21:04.102 --> 21:06.834
Last time I cut
my hand on the can.

21:11.234 --> 21:13.667
You know, I really did, feel bad
about not getting your present.

21:13.702 --> 21:16.434
So, I thought of a present
I could get you

21:16.469 --> 21:18.467
that you didn't have
to put on a credit card.

21:18.502 --> 21:21.601
No, not that.

21:21.636 --> 21:24.534
No, because after all,
I wasn't wrong in this.

21:29.968 --> 21:32.968
Anyway, there it is.

21:33.003 --> 21:37.200
Oh, gee, you tore up
my dashboard. Thanks.

21:37.235 --> 21:39.467
Yeah, but look where
the dashboard used to be.

21:39.502 --> 21:41.968
Oh, a radio!

21:42.003 --> 21:44.901
Yeah, I took it out of my car
and put it in yours.

21:44.936 --> 21:46.968
Happy anniversary.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.400
That's so sweet.

21:50.435 --> 21:54.701
I fixed the bass control so
it doesn't vibrate your tush.

21:54.736 --> 21:58.968
Actually,
I kind of like that.

21:59.003 --> 22:04.634
Oh, Al, I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

22:04.669 --> 22:06.400
What's that thing
on the front seat?

22:06.435 --> 22:09.734
Oh, that's your
air conditioner.

22:11.067 --> 22:14.901
Hey, listen, you know,
we haven't been alone all day.

22:14.936 --> 22:18.000
Want to sit out here and listen
to the oldies station?

22:18.035 --> 22:19.701
Yeah, sure.

22:21.033 --> 22:24.300
<i>* Aha, aha
War! Hooh! *</i>

22:24.335 --> 22:25.601
Our song!
Our song!

22:25.636 --> 22:27.801
<i>* What is it good for? *</i>

22:27.836 --> 22:29.334
<i>*Absolutely
Nothing *</i>

22:29.369 --> 22:30.934
<i>* Say it again, y'all *</i>

22:30.969 --> 22:33.300
<i>* War! Hooh!
Look out *</i>

22:33.335 --> 22:36.067
<i>* What is it good for? *</i>

22:36.102 --> 22:38.801
<i>* Absolutely nothing
Listen to me *</i>

22:38.836 --> 22:43.300
<i>* Ahh War! I despise *</i>

22:43.335 --> 22:46.067
<i>* 'Cause it means
Destruction **</i>
