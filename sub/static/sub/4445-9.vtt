00:05.006 --> 00:07.006
Slow the internet down
to worse than dial up.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.974
- You're hired.
- We need to get zack out

00:08.976 --> 00:11.343
Of the city right now.
Go to your mother's in vermont.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.645
- What are you talking about?
- Something awful is happening.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.447
- If there's such a big
emergency, why isn't there

00:15.449 --> 00:17.983
Any news about it?
- You called the fbi?

00:17.985 --> 00:19.985
- Take it easy, doctor.
- Ok, doc. Stop right there.

00:19.987 --> 00:22.955
- No, you shut your mouth and
you listen to me. I invited

00:22.957 --> 00:25.991
You in, you are a guest, and you
need to start acting like one.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.960
- We got inventory tonight
and it's going to go late.

00:27.962 --> 00:30.129
- I won't wait up.
(moaning)

00:30.131 --> 00:33.365
- Jeff, what happened?

00:35.402 --> 00:39.104
Hey! Did you do this?!
(growling)

00:41.141 --> 00:42.908
- Jim, what happened?
- Scraped it when she knocked

00:42.910 --> 00:45.411
Me down.
- Close your eyes.

00:45.413 --> 00:48.547
- I think you got nicked.
It's a worm.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.516
- (nora): Oh god.
- You have to kill me.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.151
Once I turn, I'm going
to go after them, right?

00:52.153 --> 00:55.154
- The ones you love.
Release him. Do it now,

00:55.156 --> 00:57.923
Before it's too late!
- No!

00:57.925 --> 00:59.992
- Ah!
(bang! Bang)

01:01.027 --> 01:03.095
(dog barking)
(screaming)

01:05.031 --> 01:07.766
- Ok. Will you tell your mom
to call me, ok?

01:07.768 --> 01:10.002
None of this texting shit.
- Ok.

01:10.004 --> 01:12.071
- Maybe her phone broke
or she lost it.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.406
I left her a lot of messages,
normally she calls me

01:14.408 --> 01:17.009
To tell me how annoying I am.
- Maybe the battery died,

01:17.011 --> 01:19.078
Sometimes she forgets
to charge it.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.947
- My god, with the noise all
day! The cops, helicopters...

01:21.949 --> 01:24.850
I don't know what's going on.
Hey, hey. Honey, honey.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.086
Are you sure matt's home?
You know, it's looking

01:27.088 --> 01:29.855
Kind of dark in there.
- Look, ma. There he is.

01:29.857 --> 01:33.025
- Alright, alright.
You go quickly, it's cold.

01:33.027 --> 01:36.028
My god, what'd you got in there?
A dead dog?

01:36.030 --> 01:38.097
You tell her to call me even
though I'm pissed off.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.799
- Ok.
- Ok, darling. Have a good one.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.968
- Bye.

01:51.611 --> 01:54.713
Mom?

01:57.951 --> 02:01.153
Mom? Matt?

02:01.155 --> 02:03.355
- That's my place right there.

02:09.129 --> 02:12.030
- What happened to the house?

02:16.102 --> 02:18.937
Mom?
(growling)

02:18.939 --> 02:21.340
Oh my god!

02:27.614 --> 02:30.482

02:37.258 --> 02:39.758
- I don't know.
- Be right back.

02:42.128 --> 02:45.030

02:46.966 --> 02:48.967

03:10.990 --> 03:13.992
- No, get down! Stay away
from his body. Are you ok?

03:13.994 --> 03:16.361
Are you bleeding?
- I don't think so.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.830
- Where's your mother?
Did you talk to your mother?

03:18.832 --> 03:21.567
- I don't know, I just got home
and that's when he attacked me.

03:32.011 --> 03:34.413
- Who was that?

03:34.415 --> 03:37.716
- My ex-wife's boyfriend.
- Not anymore.

03:56.703 --> 03:59.271
(panicked breathing)

03:59.273 --> 04:03.609
- We should search the house.
- Ok.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.111
- Is there a basement?

04:12.118 --> 04:15.387
- If my wife is down there,
nothing happens

04:15.389 --> 04:20.058
When my son's here. Understand?
- Fair enough.

04:20.060 --> 04:23.295
- I'll search upstairs.
- Did you hear me?

04:23.297 --> 04:27.899
- Loud and clear.
- Hey.

04:27.901 --> 04:31.103
Where would I find some booze?

04:31.105 --> 04:33.939
- I don't live here anymore.

04:37.944 --> 04:41.046
- Ah!
- Dad, what's happening?

04:41.048 --> 04:43.615
(bottles tinkling)
- this is part of the epidemic

04:43.617 --> 04:46.952
We've been investigating.
Matt was infected.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.954
Now I need you to tell me:
When was the last time you heard

04:48.956 --> 04:50.956
From your mother?
- This morning.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.759
They were arguing about you
because you told us to go

04:53.761 --> 04:55.994
To vermont. Matt thought
that was stupid, he didn't even

04:55.996 --> 04:59.131
Come home last night.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.932
- Did you do that
to matt's face?

05:00.934 --> 05:03.969
- No. He was like that
when I got here.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.838
- He was wounded
in another fight.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.907
(breathing deeply)
- use your inhaler.

05:08.909 --> 05:12.110
Just relax.

05:12.112 --> 05:15.180
- The house is empty.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.790
You understand that
if the worst has happened

05:24.792 --> 05:27.092
Your wife will return
for her son.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.528
We should take him
from here, quickly.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.497
- Yep.
- And you must get rid

05:32.499 --> 05:35.334
Of that body.
- How?

05:35.336 --> 05:39.137
- We burn it.

05:39.139 --> 05:42.040
(coughing)

05:47.880 --> 05:50.115
(cough)

05:52.051 --> 05:56.021
- I never felt so sick
in my whole life.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.424
- This asshole promised me
a doctor.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.062
How many times I gotta tell you
to get a doctor in here?

06:04.064 --> 06:06.998
This some illegal shit.
We got rights!

06:07.000 --> 06:11.203
Look at him man, he's dying.

06:11.205 --> 06:14.306
You hear me?

06:14.308 --> 06:16.241
- He's not the only one
suffering. A lot of guys are

06:16.243 --> 06:18.410
Coming in here sick.
The city system for

06:18.412 --> 06:21.146
First responders is messed up.
- This is bullshit!

06:21.148 --> 06:23.315
If there's such an emergency,
why don't y'all

06:23.317 --> 06:25.016
Bring more doctors in here?
- Settle down, we've got

06:25.018 --> 06:27.853
A transport van out back to take
you to rikers in a few minutes.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.422
- No, no, no. We not going
nowhere until he sees a doctor.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.424
He's not going
to make it to no rikers.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.494
- If you want your friend
to stay alive, get his ass

06:35.496 --> 06:37.896
On the van. There's a doctor
who checks every new arrival

06:37.898 --> 06:41.566
At intake.
Elizalde, williams,

06:41.568 --> 06:44.770
Orlando, riley. Up and at 'em.

06:44.772 --> 06:48.607
- C'mon. We gonna get you some
help. Let's go.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.743
Hey, yo. Help me get him up.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.979
- Alright.
(felix hacking)

06:56.182 --> 06:59.351
- On three. One, two, three.

07:02.688 --> 07:05.390
- Help me, gus!

07:05.392 --> 07:08.460
- I'm here. I'm right here, ok?
- <i>Gracias, hermano.</i>

07:08.462 --> 07:11.096
I know you do.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.732
- How did you get out of jail?
- I escaped.

07:13.734 --> 07:18.069
- From the fbi? For real?
- Yeah. I saw an opening

07:18.071 --> 07:21.940
And I took it. I shouldn't have
been arrested to begin with.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.643
I didn't do anything wrong.

07:24.645 --> 07:29.047
Careful. This is warmer.
- Where did you get that dagger?

07:29.049 --> 07:31.883
- From mr. Setrakian,
the older man from downstairs.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.753
He's helping us out.
Now listen, zack,

07:34.755 --> 07:37.322
I have to stay here
and fix the place up.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.658
Your mom will flip
if she sees it like this.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.160
- Ok.
- Mr. Setrakian will take you to

07:42.162 --> 07:44.963
His pawn shop. That's where I've
been hiding out. I trust him.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.732
He'll protect you
and I'll be right behind.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.501
Nothing will stop me
from getting there.

07:49.503 --> 07:53.939
- Ok.

07:53.941 --> 07:57.042
What about mom, dad?
Did something happen to her?

08:00.746 --> 08:03.515
- I don't know where your mom is
but I'm going to find her.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.184
Your mom's a survivor.

08:10.022 --> 08:13.592
- You want some?
- I had some bread.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.230
- Can I get you something?

08:21.367 --> 08:25.871
You know, if we had handled your
friend the way you wanted to,

08:25.873 --> 08:28.440
We'd all be dead.

08:28.442 --> 08:31.510
- There is no hope
for those who are infected,

08:31.512 --> 08:35.881
You must understand this.
- You don't know everything.

08:35.883 --> 08:40.385
- No, but I do know about this.
- I did what needed to be done.

08:40.387 --> 08:44.623
- He's right.
- Nobody's asking you.

08:48.661 --> 08:51.029
- How would you
have handled it, hm?

08:51.031 --> 08:54.566
Teach me something.

08:56.669 --> 09:00.071
- If someone was going
to help him die,

09:00.073 --> 09:02.874
It should have been one of us.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.976
Someone who loved him.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.913
- Oh.

09:07.915 --> 09:12.984
But you weren't ready to do it.

09:14.987 --> 09:20.091
- I can't teach you
how to be a human being.

09:20.093 --> 09:24.095
Eat your bologna.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.237
- Well if we're about done here,
I'd love a ride home.

09:32.239 --> 09:36.107
- We're done. I'll drop you.
- Then we go to my shop.

09:36.109 --> 09:40.979
I have things there...
To plan for our next battle.

09:44.116 --> 09:46.885
- (guard): <i>Weiter! Weiter!</i>

09:46.887 --> 09:48.954
<i>Schneller!</i>

09:48.956 --> 09:51.823
Schenller! Schneller! Schneller!

09:55.895 --> 09:59.931
(guard yells in german.)

10:20.953 --> 10:24.055
- Zack is going back with you.
I'll meet you in an hour.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.925
I'm trusting you with him.
Please... Take good care of him.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.927
- Of course.
- I'm trusting you.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.930
- Yes, I know.
My hearing is excellent.

10:31.932 --> 10:35.133
- I'm staying, too.
We'll get it done faster.

10:38.671 --> 10:42.240
- Hey, I'm fet.
- Zack.

10:49.081 --> 10:52.784
- Maybe it's weird to say,
but...

10:52.786 --> 10:55.954
It hurt me, too.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.790
Seeing that happen
to your friend.

10:58.792 --> 11:03.895
Even if it was the only way.
Sorry.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.833
- Hey.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.307
- Don't let the cops
get you again.

11:16.309 --> 11:19.944
- The cops are very busy,
they don't have time for me.

11:19.946 --> 11:23.415
- When mom comes back, tell her
I'm mad and diane is mad, too.

11:38.898 --> 11:41.132
- You first. Go on.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.214
Thanks for the lift!
It's been a real blast.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.651
- I'm coming up with you,
to make sure it's safe.

11:59.653 --> 12:02.887
- Fine. I'm not making out
with you, though.

12:13.265 --> 12:16.401
Nikki?

12:16.403 --> 12:19.237
Nikki?!

12:23.008 --> 12:25.009
No, no, no, no...

12:25.011 --> 12:27.679
No, no, no...

12:27.681 --> 12:29.914
Bitch.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.584
Nikki I'm going to kill you!

12:45.264 --> 12:48.199
Shit, she stole my backup!

12:57.409 --> 13:01.112
Nikki, the girl I was with
at the store, she um...

13:01.114 --> 13:06.484
Stole all my money.
Every last penny that I had.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.387
- This is why I don't have
roommates.

13:09.389 --> 13:13.958
- Yeah that,
and 'cause you're 40.

13:13.960 --> 13:18.062
We were more than roommates.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.331
We were very close.

13:20.333 --> 13:24.235
- This is why
I don't have friends.

13:24.237 --> 13:28.673
- She took my laptop. Everything
I have is on my laptop.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.142
- Maybe, um...
She thought you were dead.

13:31.144 --> 13:35.013
- That's even worse!

13:39.518 --> 13:42.153
All... The bloody... Ugly...

13:42.155 --> 13:46.257
Shit that you love!
Ah!!!

13:54.800 --> 13:56.801
(sirens)
(man screams)

13:56.803 --> 14:01.539
(man on radio)
(zack cries softly.)

14:01.541 --> 14:06.845
- Come up here, son.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.848
- (radio <i>):... Federal officials</i>
<i>tomorrow to ask that the city</i>

14:09.850 --> 14:12.183
<i>Be declared a disaster area.</i>

14:28.534 --> 14:31.202
- What's the matter?
- My mother's going to be upset

14:31.204 --> 14:34.072
About her boyfriend, matt,
being dead.

14:34.074 --> 14:38.209
- I... I know you'll find this
hard to believe,

14:38.211 --> 14:42.881
But matt came after you
because he loved you.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.650
- Why did you call him
a vampire?

14:45.652 --> 14:48.987
- Because that's...
What he turned into.

14:48.989 --> 14:54.525
- My dad didn't use that word.
- He will. Trust me.

14:54.527 --> 14:58.096
There's power in naming things.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.331
- He was so mad at me.

15:00.333 --> 15:05.270
- No, no, no. He was hungry.

15:05.272 --> 15:09.073
Like a rabid animal.
No different.

15:09.075 --> 15:13.077
Beloved dogs turn on you after
they've been bitten

15:13.079 --> 15:17.382
By a fox or a bat
or any infected animal.

15:17.384 --> 15:23.521
Think of it as rabies being
passed from human to human.

15:25.858 --> 15:29.127
Mourn matt's passing,
then move on.

15:29.129 --> 15:36.100
Life will insist.
You mustn't fail life.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.647

16:11.904 --> 16:14.172
What are you doing in here?

16:21.513 --> 16:26.417
You are bereft after finishing
that superb project.

16:29.822 --> 16:34.192
Yes. I've read artists are
afflicted that way.

16:34.194 --> 16:38.096
The emptiness that follows
when a great thing

16:38.098 --> 16:41.032
Has been completed.
The fear...

16:41.034 --> 16:43.101
That you will never be able
to replicate it.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.207
- Perhaps you are correct,
herr standartenfuhrer.

16:49.209 --> 16:53.044
(boom!)
(abraham breathes quickly)

16:56.815 --> 16:58.883
What will become of us?
(boom!)

17:01.186 --> 17:03.855
- For now, you will rejoin
the others.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.697
(car sirens)
- you ok?

17:12.699 --> 17:15.099
- Yeah.
- I'm going to go.

17:18.003 --> 17:20.171
- Ronnie, not now, ok?

17:20.173 --> 17:23.841
The boy smokes so much weed,
his brain is fried.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.843
Ronnie, this isn't
your apartment.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.546
(growling quietly)

17:28.548 --> 17:31.482
Ronnie?
- Move!

17:38.924 --> 17:42.160
Ho! This was handy.

17:44.096 --> 17:47.065
You can't stay here.
This building's infected.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.400
- He was like another brother--
- no, no, no, no.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.370
Stay away
from the body, alright?

17:52.372 --> 17:56.674
Look at me. You go grab some
clothes, then we're going to go.

17:56.676 --> 18:01.312
Yeah? You alright? Go.

18:16.361 --> 18:20.064
- We've been waiting. We'd be
gone had you left the keys.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.633
- Which is why I didn't.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.870
It wasn't good in there.
- Were there vampires?

18:25.872 --> 18:28.072
- Yeah.

18:28.074 --> 18:31.342
- Well then we best get moving.

18:33.712 --> 18:37.582
I assume she's coming with us.

18:37.584 --> 18:41.452
- She's coming with us.
- Right then, well then.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.989
Since you've decided, let's go!

18:56.135 --> 19:00.972
- You think this is funny?!
Leaving me here!

19:00.974 --> 19:05.476
Who are these people?
I'm not cooking for them!

19:07.913 --> 19:09.914
- Nora's mother.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.250
- Obviously.
- Come.

19:19.091 --> 19:21.926
Close the door.

19:33.639 --> 19:37.041
- Whoa!
- My god it's like the batcave.

19:50.956 --> 19:54.458
- Read and learn. It will, uh...

19:54.460 --> 19:57.528
It will help you.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.998
- (fet): You saw this coming,
huh?

20:01.000 --> 20:04.869
- I hoped it wouldn't.

20:06.805 --> 20:09.140
- There must be humans
helping this cause.

20:09.142 --> 20:12.843
Do you know who they are?

20:12.845 --> 20:16.981
- No, but I can speculate.
Those who are seduced

20:16.983 --> 20:22.687
By the promise of power
and who yearn to leave a mark

20:22.689 --> 20:28.392
That will somehow elevate them.
They inadvertently hurt

20:28.394 --> 20:32.663
Many people, but inadvertent
or not, the damage is done.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.969
- May I?
- Sure.

20:42.908 --> 20:46.043
We can get the master,
the one responsible for all this

20:46.045 --> 20:50.581
But I need your help.
You're... Unsentimental.

20:50.583 --> 20:55.419
Precise.
Not ruled by your emotions.

20:55.421 --> 21:00.258
- I have feelings.
- Leave the feeling to others.

21:09.901 --> 21:14.105
He's nesting.
Somewhere in the city.

21:14.107 --> 21:17.074
You know new york.
We could find him

21:17.076 --> 21:20.244
If we work together.

21:20.246 --> 21:26.684
- I'm going home to get
a few things. I'll be back.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.467
- Do you think kelly did that
to his face?

21:43.469 --> 21:46.337
- I do. And I hope she got away.

21:46.339 --> 21:50.975
- Where the hell is she?

21:52.911 --> 21:56.347
She could be anywhere.

21:59.251 --> 22:03.087
Maybe matt scared her
and she's hiding somewhere.

22:08.093 --> 22:10.094
- You know in argentina,
you inherit the dread

22:10.096 --> 22:15.866
Of things turning upside-down
overnight. Just like this.

22:15.868 --> 22:19.970
People disappeared.
- This isn't argentina.

22:19.972 --> 22:23.708
She's not disappeared.

22:23.710 --> 22:27.011
My son isn't growing up
without a mother.

22:54.406 --> 22:57.041
(helicopters above)

22:57.043 --> 23:00.745
- I can't believe jim is gone.

23:00.747 --> 23:03.981
He was the kindest man I knew.

23:03.983 --> 23:09.053
Always generous. Always.

23:15.360 --> 23:20.164
- When he lifted up his shirt
and I saw his back.

23:20.166 --> 23:23.167
That was the worst moment
of my life.

23:26.037 --> 23:28.205
- This is the weirdest
memorial ever.

23:28.207 --> 23:32.943
Should we say something about...
- Matt.

23:35.881 --> 23:39.150
No.

23:43.922 --> 23:47.057
- Back at the store you said
the vampires were targeting us.

23:47.059 --> 23:51.028
Is that true?
- It is.

23:51.030 --> 23:56.033
These are coordinated assaults;
disabling methods

23:56.035 --> 24:01.105
Of communication,
the internet, cellphones,

24:01.107 --> 24:05.109
They're all part of it.
Making sure people don't

24:05.111 --> 24:07.711
Put the pieces together.

24:07.713 --> 24:10.314
- Do you know who
eldritch palmer is?

24:10.316 --> 24:14.084
- One of the most powerful men
in the world, yes.

24:14.086 --> 24:17.488
- He hired me.
- To do what?

24:17.490 --> 24:21.926
- I thought it was
about corporate bullshit

24:21.928 --> 24:24.094
And greed about making him
more money.

24:24.096 --> 24:29.066
- What did you do?
- I worked my ass off

24:29.068 --> 24:32.736
To shut the internet down.

24:32.738 --> 24:38.943
- You disrupted communication
on behalf of eldritch palmer?

24:38.945 --> 24:42.980
- Me and my hacker group, yeah.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.851
Now I had malware in the city's
top four fibre optic centres.

24:46.853 --> 24:50.788
Crashed the shit out of those.
Plus twitter and facebook

24:50.790 --> 24:54.425
And a big chunk of the deep web.
Now, normal people don't even

24:54.427 --> 24:59.597
Know what that is, but...
It's all dark now.

24:59.599 --> 25:06.637
- Well, I uh...
I appreciate your honestly.

25:06.639 --> 25:10.174
- Yeah, I was feeling
so superior.

25:10.176 --> 25:16.146
Like I'd gotten one over
on those bloody assholes.

25:16.148 --> 25:19.683
Took all their money.

25:19.685 --> 25:24.688
Which is now stolen from me.
Deserve that.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.558
I should've followed
my instincts.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.127
Did not like
that plastic-faced freak.

25:30.129 --> 25:35.299
Stomach dropped the moment
I saw him.

25:35.301 --> 25:41.705
- Who's that?
- With palmer. Some german dude.

25:41.707 --> 25:47.912
We weren't introduced.
- Yes.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.980
Can you undo what you've done?

25:49.982 --> 25:52.883
- Well, isn't it
too late for that?

25:52.885 --> 25:56.987
- We don't ever make
that concession.

26:17.776 --> 26:20.611
(fluttering)

26:23.248 --> 26:26.383
<i>(strigoi</i> growls)

26:26.385 --> 26:29.520
Agh. Ah...

26:36.561 --> 26:39.129

27:00.919 --> 27:03.787
You have watched me
for how many nights?

27:03.789 --> 27:07.324
Eyes open, lying there.

27:07.326 --> 27:10.661
Thinking I can't see you.

27:10.663 --> 27:14.965
(crunching sound)
- agh...

27:14.967 --> 27:17.167
- After all this time,

27:17.169 --> 27:20.938
Is this the best you could do
to try to stop me?

27:20.940 --> 27:25.242
- Oh god, please help me.
- Where is he?

27:25.244 --> 27:29.179
Where is your god?

27:29.181 --> 27:31.081
I don't see him.
(cracking)

27:31.083 --> 27:33.083
- Ah!

27:34.919 --> 27:40.157
- There is no one to help you,
wood carver.

27:51.970 --> 27:56.173
- You better swallow that shit.
- Mind your business.

27:58.109 --> 28:00.878
- Give me some space, man!
(growling)

28:00.880 --> 28:04.181
- When I get out of these cuffs,

28:04.183 --> 28:05.983
I'm going to knock out
whatever's left of those

28:05.985 --> 28:09.186
Rotten ass teeth you got.
You hear me?

28:09.188 --> 28:12.089
Bitch.

28:16.061 --> 28:19.196
Yo you alright, felix?

28:19.198 --> 28:21.965
Felix?

28:23.034 --> 28:25.636
- Hey, cut the shit back there!

28:28.740 --> 28:31.775

28:38.149 --> 28:41.385

<i>armed with a 9mm...Caution.</i>

28:47.092 --> 28:50.928
- Yeah. I know I left you there
for a long time.

28:50.930 --> 28:54.998
I'm sorry.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.969

<i>Please respond.</i>

30:12.778 --> 30:14.812

30:14.814 --> 30:17.915
- I promised you.
- <i>Do you need backup car 739?</i>

30:17.917 --> 30:20.984
(screaming and banging)

30:20.986 --> 30:23.954
Nobody better move!
- Help us, man! Help us!

30:23.956 --> 30:26.089
- Get us out of here, man!
C'mon!

30:26.091 --> 30:29.159

30:29.161 --> 30:32.029

30:53.319 --> 30:55.285
Shoot him!

30:55.287 --> 30:57.921

<i>Felix!</i>

31:17.575 --> 31:20.043

31:37.996 --> 31:41.565
- Does my dad have the key?
- Yes.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.768
- I hope nothing happened
to him. Do you think

31:44.770 --> 31:46.770
He's on his way?
- He will be here,

31:46.772 --> 31:50.073
I promise you. It...

31:50.075 --> 31:53.877
It takes time to do
what he has to do.

31:53.879 --> 31:57.481
- What does he have to do?

32:05.023 --> 32:07.991

David, my fingers.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.277
Could you help straighten them?
Please, just... Help?

32:27.279 --> 32:30.480
- Did the guards do this to you?
- Yes, they caught me stealing

32:30.482 --> 32:32.916
Bread and they crushed my hands
in the pantry door. Please,

32:32.918 --> 32:35.085
Just pull as hard as you can.
- Ok.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.954
- Agh!
- Sorry.

32:36.956 --> 32:40.557
- Ah!

32:40.559 --> 32:43.493
- That group.

You, this group.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.731
You, that group.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.967
That group.

32:51.903 --> 32:54.571
- Are you not well?
- I'm fine.

32:54.573 --> 32:57.274
- Do you hide something
in your hands?

32:57.276 --> 33:01.979
- No, sir.
- Show them to me.

33:35.980 --> 33:38.181
This group.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.183
Up, around!
- That group, now.

33:40.185 --> 33:43.353

What are you doing here?!

Beyond the obvious.
Zack's not answering his texts,

Kelly's mia all day.
I'm looking for her

35:24.156 --> 35:25.956
Is what I was doing here.
And who are you?

35:25.958 --> 35:28.892
- Nora.
- Oh, right. Yeah, yeah. Ok.

35:28.894 --> 35:32.095
You're nora. Yeah,
kelly's told me a lot about you.

35:32.097 --> 35:34.898
You two work together, right?
Where's zack, eph?

35:34.900 --> 35:36.967
- He's fine,
he's with my colleagues.

35:36.969 --> 35:40.237
- It's not safe here.
- She's serious. You have to get

35:40.239 --> 35:42.973
Out of town as soon as possible.
- Oh yeah. This is amazing.

35:42.975 --> 35:45.175
Right, right. In all your
concerned state, you still

35:45.177 --> 35:48.678
Find time to screw on the rug.
- This is important, diane.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.247
If you hear from her, call me.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.787
That's nora's number.
I lost my phone. Please.

35:57.789 --> 36:01.024
- Hey. You hurt my friend,

36:01.026 --> 36:03.960
I will cut your heart out.
Just so you know.

36:03.962 --> 36:07.531
- I love my wife.
She's the mother of my son.

36:07.533 --> 36:10.867
I'd do anything to find her.

36:10.869 --> 36:15.572
- Yeah. Ok. Pff.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.048
- We should go.
Your son's waiting for you.

36:25.050 --> 36:28.285
- Yeah, she's definitely calling
the cops.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.289

She's not my biggest fan.
- She makes mom laugh.

37:38.957 --> 37:42.259
- That's good.

37:49.967 --> 37:54.104
- So... Mom?
- First thing tomorrow.

37:54.106 --> 37:58.308
- Maybe I can help, too?
- Of course.

38:00.878 --> 38:04.614
We're a team.

38:10.955 --> 38:14.124
(opera music)

38:38.316 --> 38:41.151
- Rgh!

38:58.803 --> 39:02.072
(dogs barking)
(opera continues)

39:41.379 --> 39:43.446
(dogs bark loudly)

40:41.105 --> 40:44.207
(clank!)

40:44.209 --> 40:48.545
(crying)

40:57.054 --> 40:59.122
(sobbing)

41:01.258 --> 41:04.794
- (hoarsely): Why have you
forsaken me?

41:08.899 --> 41:11.234
(loud growling)

41:39.263 --> 41:42.298
I have done everything
you asked.

41:42.300 --> 41:48.071
- Yes, herr eichhorst. You have.

41:50.207 --> 41:52.809
- I'm ready.

41:52.811 --> 41:55.712
- Then it is time.

42:00.985 --> 42:04.187
- To a new order.

42:16.066 --> 42:18.201
Ah! Ah!

42:18.203 --> 42:20.970
Ah! Ah! Ah!

42:20.972 --> 42:23.973
(gasping)

42:37.421 --> 42:40.089
(growling)
