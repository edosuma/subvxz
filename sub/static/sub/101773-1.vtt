WEBVTT

02:07.360 --> 02:10.765
Running a little behind today,
are we, Maggie?

02:26.748 --> 02:31.318
Make sure he's happy,
and he's ready to go.

02:31.351 --> 02:34.021
We need this to be airtight.
I need...

02:34.055 --> 02:36.791
If we have lunch at 1:30,
we're just going to get drinks.

02:36.824 --> 02:37.992
Mojitos.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.862
And I need to know

02:40.895 --> 02:45.565
that you know
on the 22nd of June.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.669
- Where was I?
- Um, lunch.

02:49.904 --> 02:53.007
- I'm past lunch. We're doing dinner.
- Dinner.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.647
Do you know why
I called you in here?

03:00.648 --> 03:01.616
Come around.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.318
See what you did wrong?

03:06.353 --> 03:09.489
I said,
Helvetica New Age Ultra Light!

03:09.523 --> 03:11.025
Okay. Now go back around.

03:13.460 --> 03:16.764
The other thing you did wrong
is you brought me, ah,

03:16.798 --> 03:20.333
Waldorf salad when I asked
for a cobb salad. Okay?

03:21.035 --> 03:23.436
I don't like cranberries.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.472
I like hard boiled eggs.
Now get out of here.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.655
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.490
- How you doing?
- Fine, I'm fine.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.860
Okay. All right.

03:45.893 --> 03:50.497
So I know it can be a little
much and sometimes overwhelming.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.432
But, what did he say to you?

03:52.465 --> 03:57.872
Um, he said he didn't
like the color of my font or...

03:57.905 --> 04:00.975
- Okay. He's just really particular about it.
- Yeah.

04:01.008 --> 04:04.011
So if you see here,

04:04.045 --> 04:06.379
- you've got this whole color grid.
- Mm-hmm.

04:06.413 --> 04:10.651
You're going to pick the marine
blue, and he likes cobalt.

04:10.685 --> 04:13.120
- Okay.
- It's just he likes blue.

04:13.154 --> 04:14.822
So, yeah.

04:14.856 --> 04:17.158
- He didn't like my green.
- Yeah.

04:17.191 --> 04:18.092
<i>Um...</i>

04:27.768 --> 04:28.870
Maggie!

04:29.904 --> 04:30.838
Maggie.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.650
Don't forget
the Miller Meeting on Friday.

04:42.683 --> 04:46.854
- I know.
- And I need the Keller production schedule by tonight.

04:46.888 --> 04:47.788
Bye.

05:16.918 --> 05:19.754
- Sorry. I'm late.
- I ordered for you.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.722
Thank you.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.091
- Urgh!
- This is a rare occurrence.

05:24.125 --> 05:26.961
- I haven't seen you in months.
- I know.

05:27.895 --> 05:30.164
It's been project after project,

05:30.197 --> 05:31.966
and I've barely
had a moment to breathe.

05:31.999 --> 05:35.770
And honestly, I don't know,
I'm a little burnt out.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.805
Why don't you
take some time off?

05:39.874 --> 05:44.045
- Right.
- Seriously, when was the last time you had a vacation?

05:44.078 --> 05:46.981
I don't know.
I think, your wedding.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.716
Four years ago.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.217
Has it been that long?

05:50.251 --> 05:53.688
Yes. Okay, okay.

05:53.721 --> 05:54.622
Before that?

05:55.890 --> 05:57.658
Uh...

05:57.692 --> 05:59.794
I don't know. When I had
time off, I guess it was...

06:00.962 --> 06:02.163
when we went skiing.

06:03.264 --> 06:06.801
Six years ago.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.536
- That's not good.
- Hey.

06:10.537 --> 06:15.142
My friend Beth is opening
a new art gallery. Look.

06:15.176 --> 06:17.178
- Cool.
- Look!

06:17.211 --> 06:19.146
- Yeah.
- She's looking for artists.

06:19.180 --> 06:20.547
So?

06:20.580 --> 06:23.617
So you're an artist.

06:24.551 --> 06:29.290
Jules, I don't show my art.
And I don't want more work.

06:31.826 --> 06:32.760
Hello.

06:36.864 --> 06:37.765
Yeah.

06:38.866 --> 06:39.834
Okay.

06:41.002 --> 06:41.902
Sure.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.107
Yeah, I can get it, yeah.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.507
Okay. Bye.

06:50.244 --> 06:53.748
I hate to do this. I have to go.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.950
I just got
a last-minute proposal.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.719
- Please stay.
- There's a meeting in the morning.

06:59.687 --> 07:00.955
- I got to go.
- Please.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.790
I have to. I have to work.

07:05.993 --> 07:06.861
Jules.

07:08.029 --> 07:10.530
- Give me my phone.
- We're having dinner.

07:11.766 --> 07:13.634
Jules, this isn't funny.
Give me my phone.

07:16.370 --> 07:20.174
Give me my phone.
Give me my phone, Jules!

07:20.207 --> 07:23.677
Give it. Let go of my phone!
It's my phone!

07:24.912 --> 07:26.013
Not cool.

07:27.348 --> 07:28.716
I will call you.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.975
Hey.

07:55.009 --> 07:57.945
Hey. Mags,
I got to tell you something.

07:57.978 --> 07:58.879
What?

07:59.947 --> 08:02.683
Okay. I'm really mad at you.

08:02.716 --> 08:06.020
Like, I barely
see you for two months,

08:06.053 --> 08:09.223
and then,
I finally see you, and you bail.

08:11.025 --> 08:12.927
I'm sorry. I know it's bad.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.896
Yeah, like, really bad,
like, you have no life.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.799
Hang on, my Mom's calling me.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.634
Um, I'll call you back, okay?

08:26.807 --> 08:27.708
Mom?

08:28.843 --> 08:29.910
Hi, honey.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.615
Are you still working?

08:35.349 --> 08:38.018
Yeah, of course.

08:38.052 --> 08:41.322
Oh, honey, it's one a.m.

08:42.456 --> 08:46.894
Mom, I know. Is... um, is everything okay?
Why are you calling so late?

08:46.927 --> 08:48.996
I'm calling
about your grandfather.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.132
He passed away
peacefully in his sleep.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.368
I guess we were
expecting that, right?

08:55.369 --> 08:56.403
Well, yeah, yeah.

08:56.437 --> 08:58.706
Um, the good thing is...

08:59.874 --> 09:03.177
he left without a lot of pain.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.145
Good.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.414
Are you okay?

09:09.383 --> 09:11.785
Your father mentioned
that your grandfather left you

09:11.819 --> 09:13.154
a cabin in his will.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.257
Cabin?

09:17.391 --> 09:19.860
Since when did he have a cabin?

09:19.894 --> 09:22.263
He owned it with his brothers,
and they all died.

09:22.296 --> 09:24.131
He was the last one.

09:24.165 --> 09:27.234
You know,
I think he went up there

09:27.268 --> 09:31.472
with his parents when
he was a kid that long ago.

09:31.505 --> 09:34.408
It's up
in Rhinelander, Margaret.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.048
Margaret, you really
should get some sleep.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.117
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.451
Yeah, you, too.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.221
That's weird. I...

09:48.489 --> 09:51.091
All right, I love you.

09:51.125 --> 09:53.060
Oh, I love you, honey.

10:00.935 --> 10:02.069
<i>Hello.</i>

10:02.102 --> 10:04.004
Hey. Um...

10:05.873 --> 10:07.775
Can we talk tomorrow?

10:07.808 --> 10:09.443
Yeah, are you okay?

10:09.476 --> 10:13.814
Yeah, yeah. I mean, my,
um, my grandfather passed away.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.984
Oh, Mags. Are you okay?

10:18.352 --> 10:20.387
Yeah. Um...

10:22.122 --> 10:24.925
It was expected. So I mean...

10:26.560 --> 10:28.295
it's just weird, you know?

10:30.464 --> 10:32.299
Ah, listen.
I have to get back to work.

10:32.333 --> 10:35.202
So I'm sorry about earlier.

10:35.236 --> 10:37.938
Um, but I'll,
I'll call you tomorrow.

10:37.972 --> 10:39.306
I'm coming over.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.909
No. No.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.079
Julie?

10:56.290 --> 10:57.458
I brought Kringle.

11:02.997 --> 11:04.865
Devin's coming over.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.034
He had a late shift at work.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.970
You know, I'm really fine.

11:10.004 --> 11:13.140
I mean, my grandfather hasn't
been doing well for months, so...

11:13.173 --> 11:17.044
Like, of course,
we would be there for you.

11:17.077 --> 11:20.514
Yeah, well, I haven't
exactly been there for you lately.

11:20.547 --> 11:23.384
Hello. You're my best friend.

11:23.417 --> 11:24.251
No!

11:25.452 --> 11:27.488
Oh, he's here.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.097
She's in the bedroom.

11:42.604 --> 11:44.171
Hey, there, stranger.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.273
Hey, there.

11:46.307 --> 11:49.243
I forgot. You work late like me.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.313
You still work
for that Devil boss?

11:53.615 --> 11:56.583
Mags likes to be tortured,
I guess.

11:56.618 --> 11:59.486
I don't like to be tortured.
I like to work.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.255
And I'm working
toward a promotion.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.324
Didn't you say that a year ago?

12:03.357 --> 12:04.291
Did I?

12:07.361 --> 12:08.462
Mags got...

12:09.664 --> 12:13.133
- a cabin in the woods from her grandpa.
- Where is it?

12:13.167 --> 12:14.234
Rhinelander.

12:15.269 --> 12:18.439
I didn't even
know he had a cabin.

12:18.472 --> 12:21.041
It's pretty up there.
There's lots of pine trees.

12:21.075 --> 12:22.876
It's scary up there,
lots of guns.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.878
Scary? What.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.014
We should go.

12:28.248 --> 12:32.319
Yeah, like, I don't mind guns.

12:32.353 --> 12:34.188
It would be fun.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.522
No, no, no, no, no.

12:35.556 --> 12:39.226
I don't have time
to go anywhere.

12:39.259 --> 12:44.431
No, let's just go. You need
time off. We'll go this weekend.

12:44.465 --> 12:46.668
You need a weekend off.

12:46.701 --> 12:47.901
Mags.

12:49.236 --> 12:54.174
Please, please, please, please!

12:54.208 --> 12:57.978
Okay, okay, okay.
If I say yes...

12:58.946 --> 13:00.547
will the two of you
please leave my house?

13:03.050 --> 13:05.085
Okay. Fine. Yes.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.928
- Yay!
- Yay!

14:15.222 --> 14:17.057
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Sir.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.726
Your wife called.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.562
- Ah, to remind you about the recital tonight.
- Ah.

14:24.766 --> 14:27.534
Oh! All right.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.004
Sure. Sure.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.373
That's for my ratty nephew.

14:33.407 --> 14:36.009
His parents think he can sing.

14:37.679 --> 14:39.079
He can't.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.383
Uh, here are...

14:43.417 --> 14:46.453
the proposals for the...

14:46.487 --> 14:51.158
Weber deal, Keller deal
and the e-Founders deal.

14:52.259 --> 14:55.362
Fine, just don't forget
the Jettison Engines group.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.065
You know you,
always forgetting things.

14:59.366 --> 15:02.369
You'd think after four years,
you'd remember the fine details.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.437
Six.

15:04.672 --> 15:07.140
- Six what?
- Six years. I've worked here for six years.

15:07.174 --> 15:10.310
- Four, six, does it really matter?
- Not really.

15:10.344 --> 15:13.615
It looks like you left
the taxes out on this one.

15:13.648 --> 15:17.317
Okay, I'll take care of that.
Sir, I have a quick question.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.252
What?

15:21.255 --> 15:23.524
My grandfather died.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.428
Is that a question?

15:32.800 --> 15:34.568
No, it's just...

15:34.602 --> 15:38.305
I was just hoping that
I could take the weekend off.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.777
Well, we have
four proposals due,

15:42.810 --> 15:45.813
and I have the golf
tournament on Saturday.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.416
It's Friday, Maggie.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.686
I know. It's just...

15:51.719 --> 15:55.155
I haven't had time off
in, like, four years so...

15:56.423 --> 15:57.357
Maggie.

15:58.492 --> 16:00.594
People die all the time.

16:00.628 --> 16:03.363
It's life. Life happens.

16:03.397 --> 16:06.166
But you can't let it slow
you down. You keep going,

16:06.199 --> 16:08.836
otherwise, how would we
get any work done around here?

16:08.870 --> 16:13.106
Let's be honest and certainly if
your job matters to you at all,

16:13.140 --> 16:15.075
you'll keep with
the manifesto of this company.

16:15.777 --> 16:17.679
You can work hard,

16:17.712 --> 16:20.447
but you can always work harder.

16:21.616 --> 16:22.583
Yeah.

16:23.618 --> 16:26.253
Now I expect these proposals,

16:26.286 --> 16:27.822
and...

16:27.855 --> 16:29.891
I need you to be
available during the tournament.

16:29.924 --> 16:32.492
I got to be able to ask you
any question about anybody,

16:32.526 --> 16:34.561
because honestly,
you're the only one that knows.

16:34.595 --> 16:37.732
I'm horrible with names
and faces. You know that.

16:39.734 --> 16:41.535
Maggie...

16:41.568 --> 16:44.639
I'm so sorry for your loss...

16:44.672 --> 16:48.175
but this train keeps moving.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.277
And I know you want
to be on that train, right?

16:52.279 --> 16:53.213
Yeah.

16:54.816 --> 16:55.883
Am I right?

16:58.385 --> 17:01.756
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
I... I get it.

17:01.789 --> 17:04.358
I'll, um...

17:04.391 --> 17:06.894
do the proposals. I'll be
available during the tournament,

17:06.928 --> 17:09.831
and, um, yeah,
we'll get it done.

17:09.864 --> 17:12.332
Good. So you hear me?

17:13.901 --> 17:17.204
- Yeah.
- You're sure you hear me?

17:17.237 --> 17:18.138
Right?

17:18.873 --> 17:20.374
You're not deaf, right?

17:21.341 --> 17:24.646
No, I'm not deaf. I hear you.

17:24.679 --> 17:25.713
Good.

17:26.748 --> 17:29.149
I know you're working
towards that promotion.

17:32.754 --> 17:33.655
Yeah.

17:35.790 --> 17:38.258
Yeah. Yep.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.728
- I have been, yeah.
- Yeah!

17:40.762 --> 17:43.196
- Yeah! Yeah.
- Yeah!

17:43.230 --> 17:45.332
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's get it.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.834
- Okay.
- Let's get it.

17:47.802 --> 17:48.703
Okay.

17:50.672 --> 17:51.606
Bye.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.346
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

18:49.063 --> 18:51.666
You know we're
going camping, right?

18:52.867 --> 18:53.835
What?

19:03.845 --> 19:07.048
Are
you excited about vacation?

19:07.081 --> 19:09.549
- Kind of.
- What?

19:09.583 --> 19:11.284
I still have to work.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.988
Um, there's just too much
going on this weekend.

19:14.021 --> 19:15.757
Ugh. Okay, we'll...

19:15.790 --> 19:17.024
We get to hang out together,

19:17.058 --> 19:19.927
and I made us a playlist!

19:26.466 --> 19:28.535
- Enyou.
- Enya?

19:28.568 --> 19:31.906
- No, that's not right.
- Oh, my God. Watch out!

19:33.406 --> 19:37.712
I'm sorry, we were listening to
En... we were listening to Enyou.

19:39.579 --> 19:42.750
- Oh. Okay, do you need me to drive?
- No.

19:42.784 --> 19:46.788
This way, you can work.
I have snacks. I licorice.

19:46.821 --> 19:50.091
I have chocolate chips.
I have chips for nachos.

19:50.124 --> 19:53.828
I have cleaning supplies
for the cabin. And look at this.

19:53.861 --> 19:55.730
- Do you see this guy? Look at him.
- Yeah.

19:55.763 --> 19:57.899
"Hi, I'm a gnome.
I'll be on your front yard."

19:58.833 --> 20:01.702
Mwah. Love this guy.

20:01.736 --> 20:03.104
Cheers.

20:21.454 --> 20:25.927
Yeah. Yeah, uh-huh.
Coffee. I don't know.

20:25.960 --> 20:29.630
For some reason, he likes it
when I make it, when I get it.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.365
He doesn't like it
when other people get it.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.769
Even though
it's the same coffee.

20:35.670 --> 20:37.404
Yeah.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.607
Just tell him.

20:41.676 --> 20:43.010
No.

21:13.107 --> 21:14.075
Hi.

21:14.976 --> 21:16.611
Yes.

21:16.644 --> 21:18.846
Um, I'm in a car.
I'm headed up North.

21:19.914 --> 21:20.882
Yeah, I...

21:22.016 --> 21:25.920
I told you. Yeah, I told you
I was going to do that.

21:25.953 --> 21:27.722
No, I can. I totally can.

21:29.056 --> 21:31.959
I'm not going to... I'm not
going to screw it up. I promise.

21:31.993 --> 21:34.662
Before ten, I... I am a yes man.

21:35.830 --> 21:41.135
Yes. Yes,
I am a yes man! Woo woo!

21:42.103 --> 21:44.537
On that train. Yep.

21:48.242 --> 21:50.978
Hey, don't you have to pee?

21:51.012 --> 21:52.479
I don't have time to pee.

22:12.066 --> 22:14.835
Oh!

22:14.869 --> 22:16.203
- What was that?
- I don't know.

22:16.237 --> 22:17.939
- Pull over there.
- All right.

22:23.945 --> 22:25.512
- Weird.
- Yeah.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.552
- See anything?
- No.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.021
Is it an axle maybe? Or...

22:41.896 --> 22:43.563
Oh.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.532
Shoot, the tire blew.

22:45.565 --> 22:49.603
- Oh, that blows.
- I don't know how to change a tire.

22:49.637 --> 22:53.240
Well, I think I've
changed a tire before.

22:53.274 --> 22:56.476
I mean, I don't...
like, I don't remember, but I...

22:57.712 --> 22:59.546
- I think I've changed one.
- Okay, okay.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.983
Well, just Google...
Google how to change a tire.

23:05.219 --> 23:07.188
- There's no service.
- What?

23:09.724 --> 23:11.659
- What?
- I'll try another location.

23:11.692 --> 23:13.027
Okay, let's walk around.

23:16.030 --> 23:17.064
What the hell?

23:29.343 --> 23:31.645
- Arrgh!
- Anything?

23:31.679 --> 23:33.714
No, dude, it's crazy.

23:37.785 --> 23:39.920
Well...

23:40.921 --> 23:43.057
I mean, I guess
we got to figure it out, right?

23:43.090 --> 23:45.626
- Yeah. No.
- Can't be that hard, right?

23:48.595 --> 23:51.564
- I'm going to go inside the Google in my mind.
- Okay.

23:52.900 --> 23:54.101
Oh, oh!

24:00.808 --> 24:01.842
I got one off.

24:15.122 --> 24:16.957
- Mags?
- Yes?

24:18.225 --> 24:19.293
Don't be mad.

24:20.327 --> 24:21.695
Why would I?

24:22.797 --> 24:25.699
Um. There's no spare tire.

24:27.034 --> 24:31.172
Your husband has
a car without a spare tire?

24:31.205 --> 24:34.842
Yeah. I don't know. We bought it
used. Maybe they, like, used it.

24:36.010 --> 24:36.977
Jules.

24:40.648 --> 24:42.249
Look at me.

24:42.283 --> 24:43.884
Look at me!

24:43.918 --> 24:47.721
Maggie. Maggie, I have an idea.

24:48.789 --> 24:50.124
Why don't we just wait here

24:50.157 --> 24:52.660
until someone comes along
to help us?

24:52.693 --> 24:55.129
Someone comes along to help us?

24:55.162 --> 24:57.364
We're been out here
for a half an hour,

24:57.398 --> 25:01.869
and there hasn't
been a single car.

25:01.902 --> 25:04.738
Why don't we just walk
back to the gas station?

25:04.772 --> 25:09.910
No, Mags, that's scary. The gas
station is an hour away by car.

25:09.944 --> 25:12.947
The next town's
ten miles that way.

25:12.980 --> 25:16.016
Okay, we'll just stay here.

25:16.050 --> 25:17.885
If we walk,
it's going to be dark

25:17.918 --> 25:19.753
by the time we get anywhere.

25:21.188 --> 25:22.656
You know have faith.

25:24.391 --> 25:25.326
Good vibes.

25:26.894 --> 25:28.796
Vibes?

25:28.829 --> 25:31.165
I don't think vibes
are going to cut it, Jules.

25:53.420 --> 25:55.823
I just think, you know,
we could... we could just

25:55.856 --> 25:58.125
set the car up like we're
going to go camping, you know.

25:58.159 --> 26:00.427
Just put the thing down,
and we could sleep here,

26:00.461 --> 26:03.364
- you know?
- Someone is going to come.

26:03.397 --> 26:06.767
Jules...

26:06.800 --> 26:09.403
Oh, my goodness, I was right!

26:09.436 --> 26:10.738
Hey!

26:11.939 --> 26:14.441
Hey, friend, hey, friend,

26:14.475 --> 26:17.178
hey, hey, friend.

26:18.979 --> 26:20.948
- Hey.
- Hey, there.

26:20.981 --> 26:23.150
- Oh, sorry.
- You girls all right out here?

26:23.184 --> 26:28.322
No, we're not. We got a flat
tire, and we don't have a spare.

26:28.355 --> 26:29.857
And we don't have
cell phone service.

26:29.890 --> 26:32.026
Ah, yeah,
reception sucks out here.

26:32.059 --> 26:35.196
About a mile up the road, it
comes back, but...

26:35.229 --> 26:36.297
I told you.

26:37.264 --> 26:40.501
Hey, can you give us
a ride to the next town?

26:40.534 --> 26:42.169
Or maybe a gas station?

26:42.203 --> 26:44.939
I can give you
a lift up to the motel,

26:44.972 --> 26:46.473
but the gas station
is closed now.

26:46.507 --> 26:48.042
Jack is the owner,

26:48.075 --> 26:49.510
and he can help
you out with your car.

26:49.543 --> 26:52.513
But he doesn't open
till seven a.m. tomorrow.

26:52.546 --> 26:55.082
- You want a lift to the motel?
- Yes!

26:55.115 --> 26:58.185
Oh. Okay. Well, grab your stuff,
and I'll take you.

26:58.219 --> 27:01.055
- Thank you, you are a lifesaver.
- Oh, you bet.

27:01.088 --> 27:02.523
Hey, do you think
it's a good idea?

27:02.556 --> 27:04.291
Don't you think
we should just camp out?

27:04.325 --> 27:06.427
Do you think this nice man's
going to murder us?

27:06.460 --> 27:09.430
Hey, you girls hungry?
I got venison jerky.

27:09.463 --> 27:13.033
- No, we have candy.
- Oh, okay.

27:20.541 --> 27:23.177
- Open there.
- Oh, thank you.

27:26.447 --> 27:28.015
- So what's your name?
- Uh.

27:28.048 --> 27:31.051
I'm Julie. That's Mags.

27:31.085 --> 27:35.089
I'm a graphic designer
and a wife. I throw clay.

27:36.390 --> 27:38.892
Mags is this amazing painter,

27:38.926 --> 27:41.395
but, yeah, she works
for this terrible guy.

27:41.428 --> 27:45.065
He shall not be named.
We're both from Milwaukee.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.369
We're going to go
see Mags' new cabin.

27:48.402 --> 27:50.537
Her grandpa left it
for her in his will,

27:50.571 --> 27:53.974
but that was really
surprising to her because,

27:54.008 --> 27:55.576
honestly, she didn't
even know he had a cabin.

27:55.610 --> 27:59.880
Ha! Well, it's nice to
meet you both. I'm Steve.

27:59.913 --> 28:04.952
Um, I'm a local, I live about
20 miles up county road C.

28:04.985 --> 28:07.354
Now the motel owner is June.

28:07.388 --> 28:10.958
And her pop just passed away,
and she owns it now.

28:10.991 --> 28:14.528
Lucky I ran into you now.
You can tell her Steve sent you.

28:14.561 --> 28:16.964
Oh, that's really nice of you.

28:16.997 --> 28:18.599
- Ah, Steve.
- Yeah?

28:18.633 --> 28:20.834
Is there internet at the motel?

28:20.868 --> 28:25.272
Ah! That's a good question.
I... I have no idea.

28:25.306 --> 28:28.442
I know there's that
coffee shop that has a Wi-Fi,

28:28.475 --> 28:31.345
but that's, like, 20 miles away.

28:31.378 --> 28:33.447
And unfortunately,
I got to get home.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.349
I can only take you
as far as the motel,

28:35.382 --> 28:38.285
but June... June's
full of surprises.

28:38.319 --> 28:40.988
She... she just might
have some Wi-Fi in there.

28:54.101 --> 28:55.069
Thank you.

29:02.576 --> 29:06.146
<i>Maggie,
are you trying to get fired?</i>

29:06.180 --> 29:09.016
<i>I knew I shouldn't
have let you go. I knew it.</i>

29:09.049 --> 29:12.654
<i>It was my mistake, and now
you're messing up my life!</i>

29:12.687 --> 29:16.323
<i>And my company's
going down the tubes with.</i>

29:16.357 --> 29:19.426
- Okay.
- He sounds mad.

29:19.460 --> 29:22.429
Yeah, well,
at least I have service.

29:30.605 --> 29:32.139
Hi, there. How can I help you?

29:32.172 --> 29:35.109
- Hi.
- Hi. How can I help you?

29:35.142 --> 29:38.512
We just got dropped off
by this guy, Steve.

29:38.545 --> 29:40.414
Uh, we need a hotel
for the night.

29:40.447 --> 29:42.316
Our tire blew up the road there.

29:42.349 --> 29:44.585
- Your tire blew?
- Yeah.

29:44.619 --> 29:47.588
Oh, that's rough.
I'm so sorry to hear that.

29:48.522 --> 29:52.025
Well, I can call
Jack Junior in the morning

29:52.059 --> 29:54.228
to have him handle that for you.

29:55.262 --> 29:57.297
What kind of tire do you need?

29:57.331 --> 29:59.166
Um, we have a hatchback.

29:59.199 --> 30:00.668
Hatchback, hatchback.

30:00.702 --> 30:05.005
Well, I...
I don't know, but he will.

30:05.038 --> 30:07.374
He has a whole service station
with all that kind of stuff,

30:07.408 --> 30:11.578
uh, tires, oil.

30:11.613 --> 30:15.549
- That would be dandy.
- Yep.

30:15.582 --> 30:17.418
We need two rooms, please.

30:17.451 --> 30:19.721
No, we just need
one room, two beds.

30:19.754 --> 30:22.356
No, we need two rooms.
I have to work all night,

30:22.389 --> 30:24.626
and I don't want to bother you.
So two rooms.

30:24.659 --> 30:26.661
No, I don't care.

30:26.694 --> 30:29.664
We came here together. We're
going to get one room, two beds.

30:31.265 --> 30:35.269
Okay, yeah.
Um, for one night, uh,

30:35.302 --> 30:38.305
one room. Oh, room one.

30:38.338 --> 30:43.577
Um, it's the last one on
the end, and it will be $55.

30:43.611 --> 30:46.681
Plus tax, which is three
dollars, so your total's $58.

30:48.215 --> 30:51.753
Your name's June, right?

30:51.786 --> 30:54.021
Yeah, I'm June.

30:54.054 --> 30:55.456
Um, we didn't have dinner.

30:55.489 --> 30:57.659
- So what do we do?
- Oh!

30:57.692 --> 31:01.995
Oh, my God!
You guys are on an adventure.

31:02.029 --> 31:05.232
Well, I do have
some snacks for sale, ah,

31:05.265 --> 31:08.770
peanuts, seltzer water,
cinnamon rolls, stuff like that.

31:08.803 --> 31:11.405
Oh! Um... Yeah,
I'll take all of this.

31:11.438 --> 31:14.575
I mean, cinnamon rolls are
really good for dinner, right?

31:14.609 --> 31:18.613
Yeah, they are.
And you know what?

31:18.646 --> 31:21.381
I feel so bad for you guys that

31:21.415 --> 31:23.550
I'm going to give
it to you wholesale.

31:24.686 --> 31:27.755
Ten dollars even, plus tax.

31:27.789 --> 31:31.091
Okay. Yep, that will cover it.

31:31.124 --> 31:35.262
And you know, we're...
we're all closed up in five minutes. Um...

31:35.295 --> 31:37.030
it's Bingo Night.

31:37.064 --> 31:40.802
Last time I went, I won $500!

31:40.835 --> 31:45.072
It was... it was totally
worth it. So I mean...

31:46.139 --> 31:49.042
so I'll... I'll see you
in the morning for check out.

31:50.244 --> 31:52.412
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Yes, we will.

31:52.446 --> 31:54.181
- Yeah, you're welcome.
- Yeah, thanks.

31:54.214 --> 31:55.783
So many snacks!

31:55.817 --> 31:57.251
Yeah, night-night.

31:59.520 --> 32:03.223
I'm going to eat you.
I'm going to eat you.

32:10.197 --> 32:12.667
- Julie.
- You're really walking fast.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.067
Jules, give me the key.

32:15.536 --> 32:16.570
Heads up!

32:27.247 --> 32:30.150
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

32:31.351 --> 32:32.352
Weird.

32:33.888 --> 32:36.557
Give me the bag. Thanks, Jules.

32:41.461 --> 32:42.362
Hmm.

32:46.233 --> 32:47.134
Hey, Mags.

32:48.903 --> 32:49.771
Mags.

32:50.738 --> 32:52.372
- What?
- Let's play a game.

32:52.406 --> 32:55.509
Huh? No. I'm not playing
a game. I have to work.

32:56.476 --> 32:59.346
Come on. Just play
while you type, come on!

33:00.447 --> 33:03.483
Jules,
I'm not playing a game.

33:03.517 --> 33:05.552
I want to get this done,
and I want to go to bed.

33:06.520 --> 33:07.554
Eat something.

33:11.291 --> 33:12.192
Eat this.

33:14.494 --> 33:17.765
Come on, let's play.

33:17.799 --> 33:19.701
What game?

33:19.734 --> 33:20.902
Truth or dare.

33:20.935 --> 33:24.471
What? Are we 11?

33:25.907 --> 33:28.643
I pick... truth.

33:30.612 --> 33:34.348
Truth. Okay, well, ah...

33:35.415 --> 33:37.685
when I was dating Simon...

33:38.753 --> 33:40.520
did you have a crush on him?

33:40.554 --> 33:43.490
That was,
like, 15 years ago.

33:45.893 --> 33:47.729
Okay.

33:47.762 --> 33:51.633
He was English, and he was cute.

33:51.666 --> 33:55.903
And he was really funny, and
I had very slight crush on him.

33:55.937 --> 33:58.740
Whatever!

33:58.773 --> 34:01.208
I thought you did.

34:02.844 --> 34:03.745
Okay.

34:05.479 --> 34:06.580
Truth or dare?

34:07.782 --> 34:10.618
Um, truth.

34:11.686 --> 34:13.253
Okay. Are you having fun?

34:15.757 --> 34:18.458
I mean, what's fun?

34:20.527 --> 34:22.396
Yeah, I'm having fun.

34:23.597 --> 34:26.566
Okay. Dare.

34:27.969 --> 34:29.569
Um...

34:33.473 --> 34:35.877
I don't know.
Lick the lampshade.

34:35.910 --> 34:39.246
Oh!

34:42.249 --> 34:45.853
Oh. Ugh. Okay.

34:46.988 --> 34:48.923
Ugh.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.490
Gross.

34:57.799 --> 34:58.800
Okay.

35:04.404 --> 35:05.372
Truth or dare?

35:08.442 --> 35:09.342
Dare?

35:10.945 --> 35:12.312
Wait, what did I say?

35:13.280 --> 35:15.482
Truth. I'm meant to say truth.

35:15.515 --> 35:18.318
- Truth, right?
- It's too late. You said dare.

35:19.921 --> 35:22.389
- Truth.
- You said dare.

35:22.422 --> 35:26.359
- Well, I mean to say truth.
- You said dare!

35:26.393 --> 35:30.898
- Jules, I meant to say truth.
- I dare you.

35:30.932 --> 35:34.568
Take off your shirt and run around
the hotel, howling like a wolf.

35:36.971 --> 35:38.806
No.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.875
I have to work.

35:40.908 --> 35:44.946
- I don't have time to do that, so.
- You said dare.

35:44.979 --> 35:47.715
You said it. Do it!

35:48.783 --> 35:50.918
Don't be a pussy, Mags.

35:55.089 --> 35:57.024
Take it off, take it off.
Take off your shirt.

35:57.058 --> 35:59.694
- I'm going to film it.
- Don't you dare!

35:59.727 --> 36:02.663
Don't you dare film the dare.

36:02.697 --> 36:05.565
If you do, just don't. Don't.

36:14.541 --> 36:17.011
Mags,
the 1950s called.

36:17.044 --> 36:19.579
They want their underwear back.

36:20.580 --> 36:21.749
Shut up, Jules.

36:22.717 --> 36:23.951
I like my shape wear.

36:23.985 --> 36:25.585
You're going to get

36:25.620 --> 36:27.354
so many hot guys with that.

36:27.387 --> 36:29.624
Like I do anyway.

36:29.657 --> 36:32.325
What if I go out there
and the owner sees me?

36:32.359 --> 36:35.730
Come on, do the dare.

37:17.571 --> 37:19.439
Jules.

37:19.472 --> 37:20.440
Open the door.

37:21.676 --> 37:23.577
Julie, this isn't funny,
open the door.

37:26.647 --> 37:29.050
I can't.

37:29.083 --> 37:30.383
It's not funny.

37:32.119 --> 37:35.388
Jules, open the door.

37:35.422 --> 37:37.490
- Jules. Open it.
- Mags.

37:37.524 --> 37:40.895
I'm not trying to be funny.
This door won't open.

37:40.928 --> 37:44.598
- What?
- I can't open it, try the other side.

37:48.836 --> 37:49.804
Okay.

37:52.740 --> 37:54.374
Jules, it's not opening.

37:55.109 --> 37:56.409
Ah!

38:04.151 --> 38:07.822
Jules, frick.

38:07.855 --> 38:10.490
The owner's gone.
Her car is gone.

38:12.093 --> 38:16.163
God damn it! Come on, Jules!

38:17.098 --> 38:21.068
Okay. Okay, I have an idea.
I'll call a locksmith.

38:21.102 --> 38:23.738
No, ah, I'll call the cops.

38:23.771 --> 38:26.506
Okay, call the cops.

38:28.709 --> 38:29.610
No.

38:32.113 --> 38:33.614
Mags, there's no reception.

38:34.782 --> 38:35.750
What?

38:37.685 --> 38:41.889
Okay, I have Wi-Fi so
I can still email your work.

38:44.659 --> 38:46.861
Mags, try the door again.

38:56.137 --> 38:59.106
All right, oh, this is bad luck!

39:00.174 --> 39:01.508
Try the door again.

39:02.910 --> 39:08.015
My life...
is constant bad luck lately.

39:09.684 --> 39:13.220
Mags, Mags,
the window's bolted shut.

39:18.893 --> 39:21.228
Hey, Mags?

39:21.262 --> 39:24.597
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

39:24.632 --> 39:26.533
Can you email that last file?

39:27.567 --> 39:28.468
Yeah.

39:39.246 --> 39:43.684
- I did it.
- I feel like the universe is trying to tell me something.

39:48.555 --> 39:49.890
Are you okay?

40:24.725 --> 40:25.826
Hey, Mags?

40:26.894 --> 40:28.829
Yeah.

40:31.766 --> 40:34.567
I got... I got to
tell you something.

40:36.370 --> 40:37.271
What?

40:39.273 --> 40:41.175
I had another miscarriage.

40:45.012 --> 40:45.980
Shit.

40:47.048 --> 40:48.315
Jules, when?

40:49.283 --> 40:51.952
Like, six months ago?

40:54.021 --> 40:55.790
Why didn't you tell me?

40:57.858 --> 40:59.994
I don't know. I never see you.

41:00.027 --> 41:03.230
And when I do,
you're always working, and...

41:04.298 --> 41:08.102
that's just not something that
you talk about at a coffee shop.

41:12.239 --> 41:13.707
I'm so sorry.

41:14.975 --> 41:16.043
Isn't that like the...

41:17.711 --> 41:19.880
The... the third time.

41:21.749 --> 41:23.884
We stopped trying. It's...

41:23.918 --> 41:25.986
it's just not
in the cards for us.

41:32.726 --> 41:33.994
I love you, Jules.

41:37.198 --> 41:39.767
What?

41:39.800 --> 41:41.068
I said I love you.

41:43.204 --> 41:44.205
I know.

41:45.673 --> 41:46.674
I just...

41:47.675 --> 41:49.643
wanted to hear you say it again.

42:18.739 --> 42:20.274
Morning.

42:23.110 --> 42:24.078
Hm?

42:25.713 --> 42:27.281
Good morning?

42:27.314 --> 42:28.315
Huh?

42:29.984 --> 42:33.020
Did you girls have a fight?

42:33.053 --> 42:34.021
What?

42:35.022 --> 42:38.893
Did you two have a fight...
a couple's fight?

42:40.060 --> 42:41.695
What? No!

42:41.729 --> 42:44.398
We're not lesbians.
We're best friends!

42:44.431 --> 42:47.701
The door is stuck.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.881
What the hell?

43:13.394 --> 43:16.797
Oh, ow. Okay.

43:22.236 --> 43:23.404
The door is open.

43:24.405 --> 43:25.739
Oh, my God.

43:31.245 --> 43:33.380
Oh, by the way,
Jack Junior is coming by soon

43:33.414 --> 43:36.217
to pick you both up to help you
get your tire fixed.

43:40.187 --> 43:42.856
Yeah, bingo sucked, eww.

43:42.890 --> 43:46.093
It looks like you guys
had, ah, fun, though.

43:50.998 --> 43:51.932
So...

44:33.874 --> 44:34.875
Hello?

44:40.514 --> 44:42.583
Hey, um.

44:42.617 --> 44:45.386
Sorry, we... we had a wild night.

44:45.419 --> 44:46.854
Yeah.

44:47.622 --> 44:48.956
It looks like it.

44:49.957 --> 44:51.892
I'll give you guys a minute.

44:51.925 --> 44:55.829
Oh, okay. Thank you!

44:55.863 --> 44:56.864
Thanks.

44:59.033 --> 45:00.934
Mags. Hey, Mags.

45:00.968 --> 45:03.370
- Come on, come on. We got to hurry.
- What?

45:07.941 --> 45:09.943
- Hey, come on.
- Okay.

45:09.977 --> 45:12.379
You can sleep in the car.
I will drive, okay?

45:59.661 --> 46:04.498
You know, I got, like, some coffee and some
bagels in here in case you want to any.

46:04.531 --> 46:08.636
I know, ah, June mentioned you didn't
really eat anything for dinner, so.

46:08.670 --> 46:12.106
People like you are the reason
I love getting out of the city.

46:14.609 --> 46:17.144
So, ah, where's your car?

46:17.177 --> 46:19.681
Uhm, it's like
ten miles that way?

46:19.714 --> 46:23.350
No, um, no, it's ten miles...

46:25.219 --> 46:27.388
that way, I think.

46:27.421 --> 46:30.391
- Okay. Okay, well.
- Yeah, yeah. It's that way.

46:30.424 --> 46:32.426
We'll find it. We'll find it.

46:33.327 --> 46:35.496
Jack, you're the best.

46:35.529 --> 46:37.364
You just made my day!

46:40.968 --> 46:42.637
I'm... I'm glad to hear it.

46:42.670 --> 46:44.972
- I'm super glad to hear it.
- Yeah.

46:54.281 --> 46:55.582
Yeah, that was fun.

46:56.483 --> 46:58.118
Hoah!

47:10.130 --> 47:13.066
It's this one. It's this one.

47:31.218 --> 47:34.154
Jack, thank you so much.

47:34.188 --> 47:36.490
I really appreciate
everything you did.

47:37.659 --> 47:39.326
How much do we owe you?

47:40.795 --> 47:42.029
Well...

47:43.263 --> 47:44.431
for the ride...

47:45.800 --> 47:47.034
coffee...

47:48.302 --> 47:50.605
and the SUV tire,
I'm going to guess

47:50.638 --> 47:52.406
you owe me right around like...

47:57.110 --> 47:58.145
$500.

48:00.615 --> 48:02.015
Excuse me?

48:02.049 --> 48:04.318
Doesn't that seem
a little steep?

48:05.352 --> 48:08.790
Woah, chill.
It costs what it costs.

48:08.823 --> 48:09.924
I don't know
what to tell you. Like...

48:11.258 --> 48:13.527
I mean, I had to travel
to the motel, and that's like...

48:14.796 --> 48:16.196
that's like...

48:22.604 --> 48:23.638
thirty miles?

48:25.572 --> 48:27.140
I'm disappointed in you.

48:28.242 --> 48:31.245
Jack. I'm disappointed
in you, Junior.

48:31.278 --> 48:33.113
Okay, I'm starting to
think I should take back

48:33.146 --> 48:35.282
all the nice things
I said about you but...

48:38.653 --> 48:39.553
Well...

48:41.221 --> 48:43.691
I sure hope you ladies get
to where you're going safely.

49:03.711 --> 49:05.412
That was expensive, right?

49:06.881 --> 49:09.249
I mean, he's such a nice guy.

49:09.283 --> 49:10.685
A nice guy?

49:10.718 --> 49:14.087
He took advantage.

49:14.121 --> 49:16.758
That bagel
that you ate cost you $300.

49:50.557 --> 49:52.326
Can you pull over?

49:52.359 --> 49:53.661
Can you pull over
here for a second?

49:53.695 --> 49:55.195
- We have service.
- Okay.

50:00.601 --> 50:02.169
Hi.

50:02.202 --> 50:06.641
Ah, finally!
The queen answers her phone.

50:07.609 --> 50:09.443
Yeah, sorry. Um,

50:09.476 --> 50:11.613
where we've been
the service has been really bad.

50:11.646 --> 50:14.314
Did you get
those proposals last night?

50:14.348 --> 50:17.250
Yeah, I got them.
They came in really late.

50:17.284 --> 50:18.820
Told you I needed them by ten.

50:18.853 --> 50:20.354
Had to wake up early
this morning

50:20.387 --> 50:21.689
and do the corrections.
Now, listen!

50:23.190 --> 50:26.259
I know you got a couple things going
on, but you also got a job to do.

50:26.293 --> 50:29.596
If you're not up to the task,
you got to let me know.

50:29.631 --> 50:32.132
I got like a mile of girls who
would kill to have your position.

50:33.200 --> 50:36.470
Where I'm headed, um,
service should be much better.

50:36.503 --> 50:38.773
Look, if you're
going through some midlife,

50:38.806 --> 50:41.341
I-should've-had-a-baby crisis,
I get it.

50:41.375 --> 50:43.377
But let me give it
to you real straight,

50:43.410 --> 50:44.578
then I got to go.

50:45.479 --> 50:47.381
You mess up one more time,

50:47.414 --> 50:50.584
and you're out of here.
<i>Comprende?</i>

50:50.618 --> 50:52.887
I'm...
I'm not midlife, sir.

50:52.920 --> 50:55.657
But I guess that depends
on how long I'm going to live.

50:58.693 --> 51:00.394
I don't have time for bullshit

51:00.427 --> 51:02.295
or lady problems
or people dying.

51:03.430 --> 51:04.398
I got to go.

51:10.404 --> 51:11.304
Fore!

51:11.338 --> 51:12.372
Okay.

51:15.275 --> 51:17.712
You okay?

51:19.814 --> 51:20.882
I'm fine.

51:30.024 --> 51:32.660
- Mags, Mags. Look at the hitchhiker.
- Hm?

51:32.694 --> 51:33.761
- Hm?
- We're going to help him.

51:33.795 --> 51:35.228
No, no, no, no, no, no.

51:35.262 --> 51:37.531
I'd just heard about
this thing where

51:37.564 --> 51:40.702
somebody's asking for help,
and then you pull over.

51:40.735 --> 51:44.538
And then, these traffickers jump out
of the bushes, and they kidnap you.

51:44.571 --> 51:47.909
- Mags, you're watching too much news.
- Don't do it.

51:47.942 --> 51:49.811
- Jules, don't do it.
- Look at her.

51:49.844 --> 51:51.713
I got to help her.

51:51.746 --> 51:54.581
Jules. I just
want to go to the cabin.

51:56.383 --> 51:57.852
I'm not leaving her.

51:59.987 --> 52:01.354
Can you roll your window down?

52:03.557 --> 52:07.360
- Hi, hey. Where you headed?
- I need to find a bus station.

52:07.394 --> 52:08.595
Okay, hop in.

52:12.667 --> 52:14.869
- Can you unlock your door?
- Fine.

52:19.841 --> 52:20.875
Hey.

52:32.053 --> 52:33.888
This is... this is amazing.

52:33.921 --> 52:36.590
Thank you for stopping.
No one was stopping.

52:36.624 --> 52:40.628
- I've literally been out here, like, three hours.
- Wow.

52:40.661 --> 52:42.830
This is Mags. We're going
to our cabin up north.

52:43.731 --> 52:45.499
Great.

52:58.578 --> 53:00.782
- What's going on?
- I got to pee.

53:00.815 --> 53:02.382
What? Here?

53:02.415 --> 53:04.051
No, in those woods over there.

53:04.085 --> 53:05.987
- That's private property.
- Okay...

53:06.020 --> 53:08.588
- I have to also.
- It's not a big deal.

53:08.623 --> 53:10.858
- I really have to pee.
- Okay.

53:27.474 --> 53:28.575
Mags!

53:30.778 --> 53:32.379
Maggie!

53:34.782 --> 53:37.051
Mags, no! Mags!

53:41.088 --> 53:42.422
Oh, my God.

53:42.455 --> 53:43.925
Get off my land!

53:43.958 --> 53:45.960
No one pees on my land!

53:54.936 --> 53:57.404
Mags! Mags!

53:57.437 --> 54:00.875
Go! He has a gun! Go!

54:00.908 --> 54:03.744
- What the hell?
- Go!

54:03.778 --> 54:05.780
- Go!
- Where's Alyssa?

54:05.813 --> 54:08.850
Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

54:22.196 --> 54:25.633
Oh, my God.

54:26.934 --> 54:29.036
- You okay?
- Yeah.

54:29.070 --> 54:30.037
Shit!

54:31.072 --> 54:35.508
- Alyssa's gone. She stole my purse.
- What?

54:35.542 --> 54:39.013
- Alyssa's stole my shit and took off.
- How?

54:39.046 --> 54:41.182
I fell asleep for,
like, a second

54:41.215 --> 54:45.052
- while the two of you were supposed to be peeing.
- Oh.

54:46.187 --> 54:48.555
We'll she's, ah, she's got to
be around here somewhere, okay?

54:48.588 --> 54:51.893
- We'll just... we'll look for her.
- Okay, okay.

54:53.961 --> 54:56.463
I almost got shot.

54:56.496 --> 54:59.734
I know. I told you
it was private land.

54:59.767 --> 55:02.036
I know.
I know, you're right.

55:02.069 --> 55:04.437
- You always know everything.
- Yeah!

55:04.471 --> 55:06.774
I do. I know things.

55:06.807 --> 55:09.509
- I'm smart.
- You are.

55:09.542 --> 55:10.945
Do you think she went this way?

55:10.978 --> 55:12.747
- I...
- That way?

55:12.780 --> 55:14.181
I don't...
I don't know. Maybe she...

55:14.215 --> 55:16.050
Do we have to turn around?
I don't want to turn around.

55:16.083 --> 55:17.919
- I... well, I don't want to...
- I don't want to go back.

55:17.952 --> 55:19.687
I don't want to go back.

55:19.720 --> 55:21.554
- But I need my purse!
- I know you need your purse!

55:21.588 --> 55:23.824
- Oh, my God!
- Let's calm down!

55:23.858 --> 55:25.760
We'll focus, and we'll find her.

55:25.793 --> 55:27.795
Okay.

55:27.828 --> 55:31.232
- Okay.
- I think we have to turn around.

55:31.265 --> 55:34.467
Maybe if we go
from the other direction.

55:34.501 --> 55:37.605
- Maybe he won't see us.
- Maybe she's just out there.

55:37.638 --> 55:40.507
- Okay, let's look. Okay, you look over there.
- A-huh.

55:40.540 --> 55:42.209
- I'll look here.
- Okay.

55:42.243 --> 55:44.612
Okay.

55:44.645 --> 55:46.881
- How long was I out?
- I don't know.

55:46.914 --> 55:51.686
How long... it depends
on how long I was out.

55:51.719 --> 55:53.788
If I was out a long time, she
could have gotten pretty far.

55:53.821 --> 55:57.758
No, I don't think she went very
far. She had some pee anxiety.

55:57.792 --> 56:00.761
- Is that her? Is that her?
- Where?

56:00.795 --> 56:02.897
- You see the backpack?
- I see the backpack.

56:02.930 --> 56:04.597
- You see?
- Yeah, yeah.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.235
- Oh, my God. Okay.
- Jules, that might be her.

56:11.571 --> 56:13.540
- Is that her?
- Let me see.

56:15.643 --> 56:19.146
- Yeah, there she is. Okay. So, what's the plan?
- What, what's the plan?

56:19.180 --> 56:21.514
Uh, ah, I'll come from the left.

56:21.548 --> 56:23.651
You come from the right,
and we'll get her.

56:23.684 --> 56:24.885
- Okay. You ready?
- Okay.

56:24.919 --> 56:26.586
- Ready? Let's go.
- Sshhh, be quiet.

56:46.807 --> 56:48.776
Where is my friend's stuff?

56:48.809 --> 56:50.711
- It's in my bag.
- Where?

56:51.746 --> 56:52.947
Why did you take it?

56:52.980 --> 56:54.949
- Because!
- Because of why?

56:54.982 --> 56:57.618
I need the money.
I don't have any money.

56:57.651 --> 56:59.186
- Ah! You...
- I don't have any money.

56:59.220 --> 57:02.056
You thief! That was not cool.

57:02.089 --> 57:04.759
I need... I need money.

57:04.792 --> 57:06.961
I left home, and I need
money to get back home.

57:08.329 --> 57:10.965
Come on, come on.

57:16.704 --> 57:17.605
It's okay.

57:17.638 --> 57:19.640
Don't console her.

57:19.673 --> 57:22.276
- Can't you see... She's desperate.
- She's a thief!

57:22.309 --> 57:23.878
I don't care.

57:23.911 --> 57:25.980
Let's take her
to the police station...

57:26.914 --> 57:28.649
citizen's arrest.

57:28.682 --> 57:31.318
Don't you think that
that is a bit extreme, Maggie?

57:31.352 --> 57:36.157
She gave you your stuff back,
okay? It's just stuff.

57:36.190 --> 57:38.759
Stuff? It's my stuff.

57:38.793 --> 57:42.797
If she wants stuff, she needs
to go get her own stuff.

57:42.830 --> 57:44.932
I'm sorry. I'm just...

57:44.965 --> 57:47.835
I'm trying to get back to Saint Paul.
My mom lives there.

57:48.936 --> 57:50.671
Hey.

57:50.704 --> 57:52.807
- What's your story, Alyssa?
- Oh.

57:54.975 --> 57:58.012
I went away
a year ago...

57:59.280 --> 58:02.750
And I fell for this guy,
but he was bad.

58:02.783 --> 58:07.221
And... and then
I got stuck in Chicago.

58:07.254 --> 58:10.024
And... I made it this far.

58:14.128 --> 58:16.831
- A real story?
- Yeah, I swear.

58:16.864 --> 58:19.333
- She's lying.
- No, I'm not!

58:19.366 --> 58:21.869
I'm just... I'm trying
to get back home.

58:21.902 --> 58:23.671
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

58:23.704 --> 58:24.905
Sixteen?

58:25.873 --> 58:29.310
Listen, I'm going
to get you a bus ticket...

58:30.277 --> 58:32.980
and we're going to take
you to the bus station.

58:33.013 --> 58:34.215
What?

58:34.248 --> 58:35.916
Really?

58:35.950 --> 58:38.085
Of course,
are you kidding?

58:39.420 --> 58:41.122
We're going
to call your mom, too.

58:43.791 --> 58:45.326
She's just a kid.

58:50.764 --> 58:51.765
Fine.

58:52.867 --> 58:55.069
But you shouldn't steal.

58:55.102 --> 58:57.738
Didn't anyone ever
teach you that?

59:00.841 --> 59:02.676
Horrible habit.

59:22.796 --> 59:24.064
Okay.

59:24.098 --> 59:26.934
- Now we go to the cabin.
- Finally.

59:26.967 --> 59:27.902
All right.

59:45.386 --> 59:46.687
Mags, is it...

59:48.455 --> 59:51.926
- Is it there?
- I don't know. What's the map say?

59:51.959 --> 59:55.763
I, there... this...
GPS doesn't go here.

59:55.796 --> 59:58.799
Ah, there's,
like, a little sign.

1:00:00.134 --> 1:00:01.368
Maybe that sign?

1:00:01.402 --> 1:00:04.271
Yeah.

1:00:06.006 --> 1:00:07.741
Oh, oh.

1:00:08.442 --> 1:00:09.843
- Here.
- Yeah.

1:00:10.778 --> 1:00:11.712
Ha.

1:00:13.147 --> 1:00:15.783
- This is game farming.
- Game farming.

1:00:15.816 --> 1:00:17.184
Okay, interesting.

1:00:19.186 --> 1:00:20.721
Yeah, this is like...

1:00:22.122 --> 1:00:23.190
rustic.

1:00:25.025 --> 1:00:26.427
Overgrown, right?

1:00:26.460 --> 1:00:28.996
Hashtag authentic.

1:00:29.029 --> 1:00:30.164
Yeah, that's...

1:00:33.100 --> 1:00:36.370
I mean, I...
I'd have to do some gardening.

1:00:37.404 --> 1:00:38.839
This is nice.

1:00:41.575 --> 1:00:42.776
Wow.

1:00:44.345 --> 1:00:46.080
Mags, Mags,
look at the butterfly!

1:00:47.248 --> 1:00:48.983
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

1:01:09.603 --> 1:01:10.904
Um...

1:01:12.139 --> 1:01:15.175
I think my mom said
there was a hide-a-key

1:01:15.209 --> 1:01:16.944
somewhere near the front door.

1:01:18.979 --> 1:01:20.981
Do you think it has electricity?

1:01:22.249 --> 1:01:25.052
I don't know. I... I didn't
even think about that.

1:01:34.395 --> 1:01:37.298
Hello? Yeah.

1:01:37.331 --> 1:01:38.866
What? No, yes.

1:01:38.899 --> 1:01:40.401
Uh, what?

1:01:40.434 --> 1:01:42.603
I, oh, I have to go.

1:01:42.637 --> 1:01:44.571
I have to go. I have
to go back to the main road.

1:01:44.606 --> 1:01:46.340
- There was better service there.
- Okay.

1:01:46.373 --> 1:01:48.442
- I'll be... I'll be back.
- Okay. I'll start cleaning.

1:02:15.936 --> 1:02:17.404
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:02:17.438 --> 1:02:19.273
<i>Why have you not
returned my texts?</i>

1:02:19.306 --> 1:02:21.241
<i>There has been no communication.</i>

1:02:21.275 --> 1:02:24.078
<i>You're incompetent,
and you don't return texts</i>

1:02:24.111 --> 1:02:27.581
<i>or emails or calls,
or voicemails!</i>

1:02:43.330 --> 1:02:46.266
No!

1:02:46.300 --> 1:02:48.335
No!

1:02:48.369 --> 1:02:51.105
Not cool! Not cool.

1:02:54.041 --> 1:02:55.909
- Did you get those proposals?
- <i>They're late.</i>

1:02:55.943 --> 1:02:58.512
Yeah, I know.
I know they were late. I know.

1:02:58.545 --> 1:03:00.147
- <i>You're incompetent.</i>
- I get it.

1:03:00.180 --> 1:03:02.216
I'm... I'm doing
the best I can here.

1:03:10.257 --> 1:03:13.394
- Tomorrow, I want to take the day.
- <i>The day?</i>

1:03:13.427 --> 1:03:16.263
- <i>You can't...</i>
- No, I'm not going to be available tomorrow.

1:03:16.296 --> 1:03:18.332
I'm going to take the day.
I'm taking the day off.

1:03:18.365 --> 1:03:19.900
I'm going to do it.

1:03:22.737 --> 1:03:25.239
- I understand that you're not happy with it. I get it.
- <i>No!</i>

1:03:25.272 --> 1:03:26.240
I get it.

1:04:10.284 --> 1:04:11.218
Julie?

1:04:12.186 --> 1:04:13.187
Hello?

1:04:15.289 --> 1:04:16.223
Julie?

1:04:18.793 --> 1:04:20.561
Do not jump out and scare me.

1:04:32.239 --> 1:04:33.140
Julie?

1:04:36.043 --> 1:04:36.977
Julie!

1:04:40.147 --> 1:04:41.415
Julie!

1:05:05.673 --> 1:05:09.109
I... I got to quit
the hardware store, George.

1:05:09.142 --> 1:05:12.079
I got to. I just don't like the
direction the company is taking.

1:05:12.112 --> 1:05:14.147
But you get
such a good discount.

1:05:14.181 --> 1:05:17.217
I do, but they're selling toys now.

1:05:17.251 --> 1:05:19.621
Hi! I... I didn't
mean to interrupt.

1:05:19.654 --> 1:05:21.421
I'm just gathering wood.

1:05:21.455 --> 1:05:24.324
- Oh, no problem. Uh...
- Yeah.

1:05:24.358 --> 1:05:26.527
But where did you come from?

1:05:26.560 --> 1:05:29.229
Yeah, we camp out here all the time.
We never run into anyone.

1:05:29.263 --> 1:05:32.099
Oh, um, my friend
has a cabin up that way.

1:05:32.132 --> 1:05:34.434
- Oh, no way.
- Well, I mean,

1:05:34.468 --> 1:05:37.739
I'm George,
and this is my friend James.

1:05:37.772 --> 1:05:39.339
Hi, I'm Julie.

1:05:43.310 --> 1:05:45.412
Okay, well, have fun.

1:05:46.614 --> 1:05:48.248
Yeah.

1:05:48.282 --> 1:05:50.618
We definitely will, yeah.
You know, definitely.

1:05:50.652 --> 1:05:52.419
Well, um, if you all feel like

1:05:52.452 --> 1:05:54.388
joining us later, we'll be
having a really fun time.

1:05:54.421 --> 1:05:56.590
Getting our own personal
rave going on out here.

1:05:56.624 --> 1:05:59.426
Roasting marshmallows,
drinking a few cold beers.

1:05:59.459 --> 1:06:01.094
- Have brewskis.
- Something like that, yeah.

1:06:02.129 --> 1:06:03.564
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1:06:04.799 --> 1:06:06.768
Got to go.

1:06:06.801 --> 1:06:08.101
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:06:19.379 --> 1:06:20.882
Oh!

1:06:20.915 --> 1:06:24.484
Get it off, get it off,
get it off, get it off!

1:06:24.518 --> 1:06:26.587
- I don't think it's on you.
- It's on me. Is it on me?

1:06:26.621 --> 1:06:28.723
- It's there.
- No, no.

1:06:28.756 --> 1:06:30.123
You're fine.

1:06:35.262 --> 1:06:36.296
You have the lights on.

1:06:37.464 --> 1:06:40.233
Yeah. Lights, but

1:06:40.267 --> 1:06:43.136
no toilet, no running water,

1:06:43.170 --> 1:06:44.772
really nasty outhouse.

1:06:46.473 --> 1:06:48.743
Well, I met some campers
in the woods,

1:06:48.776 --> 1:06:51.244
and they invited us
to roast marshmallows.

1:06:52.212 --> 1:06:53.580
Weird. What'd you say?

1:06:53.615 --> 1:06:56.249
Um, I said yeah.
They seemed nice.

1:06:56.283 --> 1:06:58.820
No, no. I'm going to bed.

1:06:58.853 --> 1:07:03.523
No. By the way, why does
it smell like death in here?

1:07:04.659 --> 1:07:08.128
Because... it does.

1:07:12.700 --> 1:07:15.268
- Jules.
- Hm?

1:07:15.302 --> 1:07:16.838
What are you doing?

1:07:16.871 --> 1:07:19.172
- This is where I found the carcass.
- Human?

1:07:19.206 --> 1:07:20.908
No, I wouldn't be here

1:07:20.942 --> 1:07:23.778
if I found a dead body in here.

1:07:23.811 --> 1:07:25.579
Gross! Burn it!

1:07:27.247 --> 1:07:28.850
Burn everything.

1:07:36.924 --> 1:07:39.426
There's no reception.

1:07:40.560 --> 1:07:41.929
Jules...

1:07:41.963 --> 1:07:45.633
- please go to bed.
- I'm not... I'm not tired.

1:07:45.667 --> 1:07:49.603
That's because you slept
on a bed last night.

1:07:50.570 --> 1:07:51.806
Please just go to bed.

1:07:52.907 --> 1:07:53.908
Okay.

1:07:54.942 --> 1:07:56.811
You go to bed...

1:07:56.844 --> 1:07:59.279
and I'm going to read.

1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:01.816
I will be so quiet.

1:08:01.849 --> 1:08:03.550
I'll be
very, very quiet.

1:08:16.998 --> 1:08:18.198
Mags?

1:08:19.801 --> 1:08:20.735
What?

1:08:23.270 --> 1:08:25.006
I want to tell you something.

1:08:25.039 --> 1:08:25.973
Mags!

1:08:26.841 --> 1:08:30.945
What? Jules, what?
What is happening?

1:08:30.978 --> 1:08:31.946
Um...

1:08:33.881 --> 1:08:36.718
I'm sorry that this trip
hasn't gone very well.

1:08:36.751 --> 1:08:38.686
Yeah, yep.

1:08:41.288 --> 1:08:45.358
We've barely
hung out in six years.

1:08:48.295 --> 1:08:50.631
Really,
it's been that long, huh?

1:08:50.665 --> 1:08:53.935
I'm really... I'm
really sorry about...

1:08:55.302 --> 1:08:57.839
you and Devin,
what you guys are going through.

1:08:57.872 --> 1:08:59.707
It sucks.

1:08:59.741 --> 1:09:00.775
We'll be good.

1:09:02.710 --> 1:09:04.544
I'm more worried about you.

1:09:05.780 --> 1:09:08.616
Me? No.

1:09:08.649 --> 1:09:12.285
No, tomorrow is a new day.

1:09:12.319 --> 1:09:14.856
Yeah.

1:09:52.026 --> 1:09:55.462
I... I want
to go to the castle.

1:10:04.471 --> 1:10:06.707
I love you, Tris.

1:10:29.931 --> 1:10:31.398
Hey, Mags.

1:10:32.667 --> 1:10:34.735
- What are you doing?
- Sshhh.

1:10:36.671 --> 1:10:38.371
Jules,
what is happening?

1:10:39.874 --> 1:10:43.945
- It's probably just animals, or racoons or something.
- Sshhh!

1:10:43.978 --> 1:10:47.748
It is not animals.

1:10:48.649 --> 1:10:51.085
- They are talking.
- They're talking?

1:10:51.118 --> 1:10:53.721
Would I be holding
this if I didn't hear talking?

1:10:53.754 --> 1:10:55.488
Yes, you would.

1:10:57.625 --> 1:10:59.392
- Okay.
- Let's...

1:11:00.661 --> 1:11:02.763
No, there's no reception.

1:11:02.797 --> 1:11:04.531
Does your grandpa
have a shotgun?

1:11:04.564 --> 1:11:06.100
I don't
know if he has a shotgun.

1:11:06.133 --> 1:11:07.835
Okay,
well, find something.

1:11:07.869 --> 1:11:09.502
What
are you talking about?

1:11:09.536 --> 1:11:10.905
Find a weapon.

1:11:25.653 --> 1:11:28.455
You go.

1:11:28.488 --> 1:11:29.489
I go?

1:11:30.858 --> 1:11:33.094
- Should we just-
- Sshhh!

1:11:33.127 --> 1:11:36.197
- Should we just answer it?
- I don't know.

1:11:36.230 --> 1:11:37.530
Oh, shit.

1:11:46.207 --> 1:11:47.574
Who is it?

1:11:48.776 --> 1:11:50.645
It's the campers.

1:11:51.946 --> 1:11:53.981
- The campers?
- It's the campers.

1:11:54.015 --> 1:11:56.083
What are
you talking about, the campers?

1:11:56.117 --> 1:11:57.852
The guys in the woods.

1:12:00.221 --> 1:12:02.623
That's weird.

1:12:04.692 --> 1:12:06.526
Did you hear the sirens?

1:12:06.559 --> 1:12:07.762
Excuse me?

1:12:07.795 --> 1:12:10.064
The sirens and the lights.

1:12:10.097 --> 1:12:13.533
You know, at first, I thought
it was... aliens.

1:12:13.566 --> 1:12:14.902
But then, it went away.

1:12:15.903 --> 1:12:18.471
What happened? I thought
you were going to come join us?

1:12:18.505 --> 1:12:21.474
Um, I, ah, I had to sleep.

1:12:21.508 --> 1:12:24.145
Oh, well. We... we have
some great music playing.

1:12:24.178 --> 1:12:26.579
And... and
there's a bonfire going.

1:12:26.614 --> 1:12:29.717
They're coming! Oh!

1:12:29.750 --> 1:12:31.052
Who's... who's coming?

1:12:34.155 --> 1:12:36.757
You have to hide, man!

1:12:36.791 --> 1:12:41.696
Get out of the light.

1:12:41.729 --> 1:12:43.530
- Oh!
- He says they're coming.

1:12:46.566 --> 1:12:47.635
What?

1:12:49.637 --> 1:12:52.505
He says they're coming.

1:12:52.539 --> 1:12:55.575
But, like...
they're high.

1:12:55.609 --> 1:12:58.145
They're, like, super high.

1:12:59.113 --> 1:13:00.748
Is that what this is?

1:13:00.781 --> 1:13:03.117
Dude, it's safe under the light.

1:13:03.150 --> 1:13:04.819
The ladies will protect us.

1:13:04.852 --> 1:13:07.154
- Huh!
- You'll protect us, right?

1:13:07.188 --> 1:13:09.190
Um...

1:13:09.223 --> 1:13:13.294
Ah, yeah, yeah, guys.
You're all safe.

1:13:13.327 --> 1:13:15.196
Everything's going to be fine.

1:13:15.229 --> 1:13:18.799
You just need to go
back to your camp site.

1:13:18.833 --> 1:13:21.202
Drink a lot of water.

1:13:21.235 --> 1:13:22.837
Okay?

1:13:22.870 --> 1:13:26.140
Oh, so you're a protector.

1:13:26.173 --> 1:13:27.808
Oh, that's so lovely.

1:13:28.743 --> 1:13:31.078
- You're so lovely.
- No, no. Don't do that.

1:13:31.112 --> 1:13:33.714
- Don't do that.
- They're all over me, man!

1:13:33.748 --> 1:13:36.650
They're over me, man!

1:13:36.684 --> 1:13:42.323
What the fuck!
What, what! No, no, no!

1:13:42.356 --> 1:13:44.992
No, no. I don't...
I don't want what you have.

1:13:45.026 --> 1:13:49.630
Get them... get them... get them
off of me! Get them off of me!

1:13:49.663 --> 1:13:53.834
Get them! What! They're aliens.
Stop it, aliens. Stop it!

1:13:53.868 --> 1:13:56.270
Stop it! No, no!
They're in my pants.

1:13:56.303 --> 1:14:02.343
They're in my...
Leave me alone! Why? Why?

1:14:02.376 --> 1:14:04.111
We need to help them.

1:14:04.145 --> 1:14:06.914
No, I want to go to bed.

1:14:06.947 --> 1:14:10.251
No, no, no!

1:14:10.284 --> 1:14:12.053
You need to drink these.

1:14:12.086 --> 1:14:14.587
You need to go back
to your camp site.

1:14:14.622 --> 1:14:16.724
You need to drink
a lot of water, okay?

1:14:16.757 --> 1:14:18.793
You just need water.

1:14:18.826 --> 1:14:22.763
- Thank you so much, protector.
- Yeah, you're so welcome.

1:14:22.797 --> 1:14:24.799
I got something
I got to say to you.

1:14:24.832 --> 1:14:27.701
I love your daughter, log.

1:14:27.735 --> 1:14:30.603
And we're going to get married
whether you like it or not!

1:14:30.638 --> 1:14:33.040
They're literally going to be eaten alive out there.

1:14:33.074 --> 1:14:35.810
Why, that's fine. Like,

1:14:35.843 --> 1:14:39.980
they've done tons of drugs and,
or LSD or ecstasy, I don't know.

1:14:40.014 --> 1:14:44.718
Or something really hard core,
especially that one.

1:14:46.887 --> 1:14:48.389
I can't leave them outside.

1:14:48.422 --> 1:14:51.292
- I just...
- I'm a lost boy in the woods.

1:14:51.325 --> 1:14:54.628
- I think it's so good we never did drugs, you know.
- Yeah.

1:14:54.662 --> 1:14:56.897
George!

1:14:56.931 --> 1:14:59.733
- I'm just going to help him back to his camp.
- No, what's the point?

1:14:59.767 --> 1:15:02.002
- It's like herding cats, Jules.
- No, no, no, no.

1:15:02.036 --> 1:15:05.106
Until they come down from it,
there's nothing that you can do.

1:15:05.139 --> 1:15:08.075
Jules, there's no point.

1:15:08.109 --> 1:15:10.911
They have to come
down from the high.

1:15:10.945 --> 1:15:13.180
There's nothing that you can do.

1:15:13.214 --> 1:15:15.316
- Okay, okay, okay. Okay, buddy.
- Come here.

1:15:15.349 --> 1:15:16.917
- Jules.
- Come here.

1:15:16.951 --> 1:15:19.286
You have to let
them come down from it.

1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:21.789
- He's not going to come to you.
- Now we're going to be eaten! Damn it!

1:15:21.822 --> 1:15:23.390
Hey. Hey, I love you.

1:15:23.424 --> 1:15:26.861
I have love for you in my heart.

1:15:26.894 --> 1:15:30.865
I have love, peace
and blessings to you, buddy.

1:15:30.898 --> 1:15:34.335
- That will help.
- Ssshhh. I love you, buddy.

1:15:34.368 --> 1:15:36.737
I got the matches buddy for you.

1:15:36.770 --> 1:15:39.740
Take that! Take that!

1:15:39.773 --> 1:15:42.710
Oh, my God!

1:15:42.743 --> 1:15:44.211
- Okay. I'm calling the cops.
- You're safe, George.

1:15:44.245 --> 1:15:46.080
You're safe, buddy.
I've got you.

1:15:46.113 --> 1:15:48.716
- Okay, all right.
- Yeah.

1:15:48.749 --> 1:15:51.852
Okay, guys.
You're done. It's all done.

1:15:51.886 --> 1:15:54.455
I'm going to go up the road
so I can call them.

1:15:54.488 --> 1:15:57.424
- Yeah, good idea.
- Hey, I'm coming inside. Let me in.

1:15:57.458 --> 1:16:01.195
- Can I come in? Aw!
- No!

1:16:03.264 --> 1:16:06.467
George, I'm hit! I'm hit,
George, George, George, George.

1:16:06.500 --> 1:16:08.169
George, buddy. Get a medic!

1:16:08.202 --> 1:16:10.137
- Get a medic!
- Get out!

1:16:10.171 --> 1:16:12.139
Go!

1:16:12.173 --> 1:16:14.909
It hurts!

1:16:14.942 --> 1:16:20.047
I don't want... I don't want to
be like this anymore, George.

1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:22.983
I don't want to be like this.

1:16:23.017 --> 1:16:27.054
- Please, make it stop.
- It's okay. It's all okay.

1:16:27.087 --> 1:16:29.723
Can you just make it stop?
I just... make it stop.

1:16:29.757 --> 1:16:32.259
Go. You just go.

1:16:32.293 --> 1:16:35.296
You just go back to your camp.

1:16:35.329 --> 1:16:37.031
I just want to go to bed.

1:16:37.064 --> 1:16:40.201
My face is wet from the water,
not from my tears.

1:16:40.234 --> 1:16:42.102
I just want to go to bed.

1:16:45.039 --> 1:16:47.308
No,
I'm just an animal now.

1:16:47.341 --> 1:16:50.244
I just live here in the woods
with the other animals.

1:16:50.277 --> 1:16:52.379
That's what I... I'm just rotten.

1:16:52.413 --> 1:16:55.349
I'm just a filthy animal.

1:17:08.796 --> 1:17:11.966
I didn't mean it.
I don't want to go to hell.

1:17:11.999 --> 1:17:14.034
I don't want to go space.

1:17:17.238 --> 1:17:19.340
I'm sure glad you called.

1:17:19.373 --> 1:17:21.175
No telling
what might have happened.

1:17:22.509 --> 1:17:24.845
Well, I need to go
check their campsite.

1:17:24.878 --> 1:17:26.013
Where did you say it was?

1:17:26.046 --> 1:17:27.948
Ah, it's
at that ridge over there.

1:17:27.982 --> 1:17:29.817
I'm so glad that you came.

1:17:29.850 --> 1:17:32.319
I was starting to think
that somebody was going to die.

1:17:32.353 --> 1:17:34.421
- Of stupidity, most likely.
- Yeah.

1:17:35.356 --> 1:17:37.157
Well, you have a safe night.

1:17:55.242 --> 1:17:59.146
No, no, no,
don't leave without me!

1:18:31.646 --> 1:18:33.480
Oh.

1:19:15.389 --> 1:19:17.491
Why are all
your t-shirts rainbows,

1:19:17.524 --> 1:19:20.494
- butterflies and unicorns?
- Are they?

1:19:20.527 --> 1:19:23.397
Hey, I thought that you were
going to take the day off?

1:19:23.430 --> 1:19:25.933
So did I.

1:19:25.966 --> 1:19:27.901
And then I thought better of it.

1:19:28.936 --> 1:19:31.939
Hey, I found out
why it's so stinky by the bed.

1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:34.174
Why?

1:19:34.208 --> 1:19:36.543
Mice, dead mice.

1:19:36.577 --> 1:19:39.146
Five under the bed...

1:19:39.179 --> 1:19:40.447
in the bed.

1:19:42.015 --> 1:19:43.584
Ugh.

1:19:43.618 --> 1:19:45.052
Gross.

1:19:47.287 --> 1:19:48.956
I don't get it, Jules.

1:19:48.989 --> 1:19:51.659
Why did my grandfather
leave me a cabin that's

1:19:51.693 --> 1:19:54.294
old and stinky and gross

1:19:54.328 --> 1:19:57.197
with acid dropping
campers nearby?

1:19:58.332 --> 1:20:01.335
I don't know, Mags. Like, maybe
it's all he had to give you.

1:20:02.737 --> 1:20:03.937
You know...

1:20:04.905 --> 1:20:08.710
he thought you needed it
or that you would...

1:20:08.743 --> 1:20:11.512
know how to bring life to it.
You know, that's what you do.

1:20:11.545 --> 1:20:15.048
You come in and you make things beautiful.

1:20:15.082 --> 1:20:18.352
- No.
- Yes! Look at your paintings.

1:20:21.088 --> 1:20:22.122
I want to go home.

1:20:24.659 --> 1:20:27.528
Hey, I have an idea.

1:20:29.463 --> 1:20:33.300
Let's do one fun thing
before we go.

1:20:34.234 --> 1:20:38.338
- Jules, I think I've had enough fun for a whole year.
- Okay.

1:20:38.372 --> 1:20:40.340
Let's just... we'll
go for a hike, okay?

1:20:40.374 --> 1:20:43.277
We'll get some fresh air and...

1:20:43.310 --> 1:20:45.979
check out the scenery.

1:20:46.013 --> 1:20:49.617
Let's just do
one fun thing before we go.

1:20:50.652 --> 1:20:53.621
- Okay?
- Fine.

1:20:53.655 --> 1:20:57.424
But I want coffee
and food first, okay?

1:20:58.392 --> 1:20:59.393
Yeah.

1:20:59.426 --> 1:21:00.961
All right.

1:21:03.798 --> 1:21:06.166
- We'll go that way, okay?
- We're doing this.

1:21:12.807 --> 1:21:14.776
This is nice.

1:21:14.809 --> 1:21:16.043
Yeah.

1:21:17.110 --> 1:21:18.646
You know, you were right.

1:21:18.680 --> 1:21:22.617
We just needed to do
one good thing before we left.

1:21:22.650 --> 1:21:25.653
- And I didn't bring my phone.
- Hey, Mags?

1:21:25.687 --> 1:21:26.587
Yeah?

1:21:27.588 --> 1:21:30.023
Can I ask you a question?

1:21:33.393 --> 1:21:35.763
- Are you happy?
- Um...

1:21:36.798 --> 1:21:40.167
honestly, I... I work so much,
I don't really think about it.

1:21:41.268 --> 1:21:43.504
But you know me,
I mean, I love working.

1:21:43.537 --> 1:21:46.073
I've always loved working.

1:21:46.106 --> 1:21:48.810
I just... I don't know,
it's seems a little harder

1:21:48.843 --> 1:21:51.378
than it has to be, you know.

1:21:51.411 --> 1:21:54.181
Yeah, maybe it's
because of who you work for?

1:21:55.582 --> 1:21:56.583
Hey, Mags.

1:21:57.484 --> 1:21:59.386
Do you see that?

1:21:59.419 --> 1:22:02.356
- What?
- Over there.

1:22:02.389 --> 1:22:04.024
It's a little bunny.

1:22:05.292 --> 1:22:06.661
I think he's stuck.

1:22:08.595 --> 1:22:10.832
Mags, we got to help him.

1:22:10.865 --> 1:22:14.201
No, no, no more helping things.

1:22:14.234 --> 1:22:16.704
He's fine. He'll be fine.
I'm sure he'll get out.

1:22:16.738 --> 1:22:19.506
He's on the other side
of the bank. He'll be fine.

1:22:19.540 --> 1:22:21.676
No, I'm... I'm,
I'm going to go help him.

1:22:21.709 --> 1:22:23.645
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:22:23.678 --> 1:22:26.748
I don't want you to get stuck,
and I'm not going to come in

1:22:26.781 --> 1:22:28.616
and save you from getting stuck.

1:22:28.650 --> 1:22:32.185
Mags, I'm going to go help him.

1:22:50.705 --> 1:22:53.641
- Jules, what are you doing?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

1:22:53.675 --> 1:22:55.710
I'm fine.

1:22:57.612 --> 1:22:59.479
I am not coming in there.

1:22:59.513 --> 1:23:00.848
You're stuck, aren't you?

1:23:00.882 --> 1:23:02.349
No, I'm fine.

1:23:02.382 --> 1:23:05.452
You're stuck, Jules!

1:23:05.485 --> 1:23:08.522
I don't want
to come in the river.

1:23:08.555 --> 1:23:10.123
I'm fine!

1:23:12.292 --> 1:23:16.563
Mags, can you hurry? We...
We're running out of time.

1:23:18.332 --> 1:23:20.233
Jules.

1:23:20.267 --> 1:23:22.235
Jules, I told you
you'd get stuck.

1:23:23.170 --> 1:23:25.105
Now, I'm going to get stuck.

1:23:27.274 --> 1:23:28.575
Oh!

1:23:35.215 --> 1:23:38.620
Jules, let's go back
to the cabin. I want to go home.

1:23:38.653 --> 1:23:40.454
Just after we save him.

1:23:40.487 --> 1:23:42.690
No. No.

1:23:42.724 --> 1:23:45.559
No, this is...
this is irresponsibility.

1:23:45.592 --> 1:23:47.527
This is crap, Jules.

1:23:47.561 --> 1:23:49.529
Irresponsibility?

1:23:49.563 --> 1:23:51.565
Are you freaking kidding me?

1:23:51.598 --> 1:23:53.266
If it was up to you,
nobody would ever be

1:23:53.300 --> 1:23:55.435
helped or... or anything.

1:23:55.469 --> 1:23:56.904
The only person that
you care about is

1:23:56.938 --> 1:24:00.942
your horrible insensitive,
perverted boss!

1:24:00.975 --> 1:24:05.880
I care about
everyone and everything.

1:24:05.913 --> 1:24:08.683
No. No, Mags. No, you don't.

1:24:08.716 --> 1:24:11.284
Ever since you started
working for him, you've changed.

1:24:11.318 --> 1:24:14.756
You're really different.
You're just a...

1:24:16.423 --> 1:24:17.925
- What?
- Nothing.

1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:20.360
What, Jules?

1:24:25.565 --> 1:24:27.835
You're a horrible bitch!

1:24:29.469 --> 1:24:31.839
You're angry all the time,
and you don't laugh anymore.

1:24:31.873 --> 1:24:35.977
- And you're always...
- you're stressed out!

1:24:36.010 --> 1:24:39.479
You're a completely
different person!

1:24:39.513 --> 1:24:43.216
I am not!

1:24:43.250 --> 1:24:46.353
That's ridiculous! Yeah?

1:24:46.386 --> 1:24:51.558
Because I don't want to
wander into some random river

1:24:51.591 --> 1:24:55.930
and save some stupid animal
that decided to get stuck

1:24:55.963 --> 1:24:59.433
does not mean
I'm a horrible person.

1:24:59.466 --> 1:25:02.970
You want to save everyone,
Jules. The whole freaking world.

1:25:03.004 --> 1:25:05.439
Well, it doesn't work like that.

1:25:05.472 --> 1:25:09.309
Sometimes, people need to buckle
down, and they need to get shit done.

1:25:09.342 --> 1:25:11.846
And they need
to help themselves.

1:25:11.879 --> 1:25:14.749
That's him talking.
That's not you!

1:25:14.782 --> 1:25:15.817
Him?

1:25:15.850 --> 1:25:17.551
Your boss!

1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:21.555
Don't you see ever since
you started working with him,

1:25:21.588 --> 1:25:23.891
you're life's been
a total shit show.

1:25:23.925 --> 1:25:26.794
And now, you're just
this insensitive bitch

1:25:26.828 --> 1:25:29.664
that doesn't even like anyone!

1:25:29.697 --> 1:25:32.265
You don't even like yourself.

1:25:32.299 --> 1:25:33.868
Fine.

1:25:33.901 --> 1:25:36.804
I never should have done
this trip with you.

1:25:36.838 --> 1:25:39.539
Thanks for telling me
what you really think.

1:25:40.641 --> 1:25:42.777
No, you don't get off like that!

1:25:42.810 --> 1:25:45.713
I am right,
and you know that I'm right!

1:25:45.747 --> 1:25:48.482
That's why you're so mad
because it's the truth.

1:25:49.416 --> 1:25:52.319
Wake up, Mags!

1:25:52.352 --> 1:25:54.789
No! No!

1:25:56.556 --> 1:25:59.026
Stop it!

1:25:59.060 --> 1:26:00.594
Stop!

1:26:06.734 --> 1:26:09.536
Stop!

1:26:10.905 --> 1:26:12.907
Jules.

1:26:14.642 --> 1:26:16.409
Jules.

1:26:16.443 --> 1:26:17.410
Jules.

1:26:19.479 --> 1:26:20.815
You're right.

1:26:22.582 --> 1:26:23.718
You're right.

1:26:24.952 --> 1:26:27.622
I've been a miserable bitch.

1:26:33.628 --> 1:26:36.563
I worked so hard for six years.

1:26:37.531 --> 1:26:39.599
I'm not married.

1:26:39.634 --> 1:26:42.036
And...

1:26:42.069 --> 1:26:45.039
I'm so stressed out
all the time.

1:26:47.909 --> 1:26:50.011
And I don't even have any kids.

1:26:50.044 --> 1:26:51.779
And I don't even want any kids!

1:27:00.021 --> 1:27:00.988
You know what...

1:27:02.890 --> 1:27:04.792
- let's go save him.
- Okay.

1:27:04.826 --> 1:27:06.426
Let's go save this animal.

1:27:06.459 --> 1:27:09.063
Okay? Okay.

1:27:11.531 --> 1:27:13.366
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

1:28:56.837 --> 1:28:59.840
Hurry up! Come on!
Come on, Maggie.

1:29:01.943 --> 1:29:03.945
Maggie, let's go.

1:29:03.978 --> 1:29:05.046
Step on it.

1:29:08.515 --> 1:29:09.784
Gerald, hi!

1:29:09.817 --> 1:29:11.786
Hey. Hi, Gerald!

1:29:11.819 --> 1:29:13.721
- Maggie and Allen.
- We're here.

1:29:18.125 --> 1:29:19.160
Oh.

1:29:28.535 --> 1:29:29.837
Your wife called.

1:29:31.038 --> 1:29:33.074
So?

1:29:33.107 --> 1:29:35.710
I hope you're working late tonight
to make up for this weekend.

1:29:36.610 --> 1:29:37.645
Yeah, I am.

1:29:38.879 --> 1:29:40.147
Don't forget to lock up.

1:29:45.119 --> 1:29:46.821
I always do.

1:29:49.056 --> 1:29:51.959
Oh, ah, I forgot about this one.

1:29:53.294 --> 1:29:56.197
I need you to read it tonight and
brief me on it in the morning, okay?

1:29:58.332 --> 1:29:59.233
Hey.

1:30:02.036 --> 1:30:03.704
It's really nice
to see you working so hard.

1:30:04.905 --> 1:30:06.073
We missed you around here.

1:30:08.843 --> 1:30:11.012
Can't afford to have you
taking that much time off, okay?

1:30:19.820 --> 1:30:20.755
Keep working.

1:30:29.864 --> 1:30:31.198
Ugh.

1:30:50.151 --> 1:30:51.886
No, no, no, no.

1:30:52.787 --> 1:30:55.256
No! No! No!

1:31:14.942 --> 1:31:18.012
So, as I was saying,

1:31:18.045 --> 1:31:21.215
I think we definitely need to
invest in marketing in that area.

1:31:22.283 --> 1:31:24.985
Why? Well, because the market...

1:31:26.754 --> 1:31:30.391
is not being
targeted in that area.

1:31:30.424 --> 1:31:33.828
What area? Well, Boston.

1:31:34.795 --> 1:31:35.963
Yeah.

1:31:35.996 --> 1:31:38.032
You already target Boston?

1:31:38.065 --> 1:31:39.934
Yeah, I know that.

1:31:39.967 --> 1:31:41.368
That's because...

1:31:43.237 --> 1:31:47.174
When I say Boston, I mean
the entire Eastern seaboard.

1:31:47.208 --> 1:31:51.112
See, your public is...

1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:55.950
currently residing
all up and down the coast,

1:31:55.983 --> 1:31:59.386
and nobody's
targeting them correctly.

1:32:00.354 --> 1:32:02.656
Right, people
aren't doing their job.

1:32:02.690 --> 1:32:05.659
Um, so what I would say

1:32:05.693 --> 1:32:09.296
is we'll get you a proposal
tomorrow. Sound good?

1:32:10.431 --> 1:32:12.967
Right, good.

1:32:16.003 --> 1:32:19.206
Well, thanks. We're going
to get you that right away

1:32:19.240 --> 1:32:21.342
tomorrow, first thing.

1:32:21.375 --> 1:32:22.409
All right, buddy.

1:32:23.878 --> 1:32:25.079
All right, buddy.

1:32:25.112 --> 1:32:28.115
Okay! You're the man now, okay.

1:32:37.958 --> 1:32:38.959
Well...

1:32:41.896 --> 1:32:47.034
this can't happen.

1:32:47.067 --> 1:32:49.436
Okay? This can't happen!

1:32:51.071 --> 1:32:52.907
You know why?

1:32:52.940 --> 1:32:55.242
Because this doesn't happen.

1:32:55.276 --> 1:32:57.044
That didn't happen.

1:32:58.412 --> 1:33:01.182
And soon,
you won't be happening.

1:33:01.215 --> 1:33:02.149
Right?

1:33:03.050 --> 1:33:04.051
Why?

1:33:05.853 --> 1:33:08.789
Incompetence,
that's a good reason why.

1:33:10.257 --> 1:33:15.996
But before incompetence,
I will go to where were you?

1:33:16.030 --> 1:33:17.364
Where have you been?

1:33:18.265 --> 1:33:22.036
You don't answer your phone!
You don't return my texts.

1:33:23.003 --> 1:33:25.206
What do you need me
to send you a trolley?

1:33:25.239 --> 1:33:27.908
You need me to send
a telegram to you?

1:33:27.942 --> 1:33:29.910
What does it take
to get through to you?

1:33:29.944 --> 1:33:32.513
I'm on a call
with the biggest CFO

1:33:32.546 --> 1:33:36.116
in the freaking Eastern coast
and nobody is here

1:33:36.150 --> 1:33:39.086
to give me the notes
that I asked for last night!

1:33:42.089 --> 1:33:44.358
Where were...
just get out of here.

1:33:44.391 --> 1:33:46.827
Get out! Go to your little desk

1:33:46.860 --> 1:33:49.363
because you obviously
don't have what it takes

1:33:49.396 --> 1:33:51.832
to make it to the big office!

1:33:55.002 --> 1:33:56.003
You know...

1:33:57.438 --> 1:34:01.508
I can't even tell you
what was going through my mind.

1:34:01.542 --> 1:34:04.078
I can't do this.

1:34:05.579 --> 1:34:07.114
People are incompetent.

1:34:09.817 --> 1:34:11.252
No company lunches...

1:34:16.523 --> 1:34:20.127
Pay for your guys' phones.
You don't answer them.

1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:21.428
God damn it!

1:34:23.397 --> 1:34:25.199
Make me sound incompetent.

1:34:29.136 --> 1:34:31.105
You're crazy.

1:34:31.138 --> 1:34:32.439
You are...

1:34:34.842 --> 1:34:36.443
I can't rely on anybody...

1:34:39.079 --> 1:34:40.414
except myself.

1:35:40.642 --> 1:35:43.277
What the hell?

1:35:44.378 --> 1:35:45.979
Stop calling.

1:35:57.324 --> 1:35:59.593
Oh, my gosh.

1:36:00.961 --> 1:36:02.529
No!

1:36:22.650 --> 1:36:25.085
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

1:36:25.119 --> 1:36:27.988
- Water?
- No. I just... I'm here.

1:36:28.021 --> 1:36:30.090
I'm going to say something.
Then I'm going to go.

1:36:41.201 --> 1:36:42.102
Okay.

1:36:46.006 --> 1:36:47.508
Okay, this isn't easy for me.

1:36:48.442 --> 1:36:50.177
We've...

1:36:50.210 --> 1:36:51.679
I've always felt like
we've been such good friends

1:36:51.713 --> 1:36:53.947
and, like, I can
tell you anything,

1:36:53.981 --> 1:36:55.449
like, you can tell me anything.

1:36:55.482 --> 1:36:58.419
And sometimes,

1:36:58.452 --> 1:37:02.022
I got to let you figure things
out, just like you do with me.

1:37:02.055 --> 1:37:04.726
- Yeah, right.
- Okay.

1:37:04.759 --> 1:37:06.960
Do you remember when
I dated that guy, Jeff?

1:37:08.663 --> 1:37:10.464
- Yeah. That was, like, ten years ago.
- Yeah.

1:37:10.497 --> 1:37:13.066
I was, like, young
and naive and...

1:37:13.100 --> 1:37:15.269
When I was with him,
I was sick all the time.

1:37:15.302 --> 1:37:17.571
Like, I always had a cold
or the flu, do you remember?

1:37:18.740 --> 1:37:19.641
Yeah.

1:37:20.775 --> 1:37:24.044
Okay, do you remember
when I had that car accident?

1:37:25.245 --> 1:37:26.980
Of course, yeah.

1:37:27.014 --> 1:37:29.416
So right before
I got in that car accident...

1:37:30.417 --> 1:37:34.188
Jeff and I got
in a horrible fight.

1:37:34.221 --> 1:37:37.625
Like, he said some things
to me that were really...

1:37:37.659 --> 1:37:39.226
cruel.

1:37:39.259 --> 1:37:41.995
Like, he was bad.
Like, I could have died.

1:37:44.064 --> 1:37:44.965
I know.

1:37:46.166 --> 1:37:48.469
Okay, well...

1:37:49.603 --> 1:37:53.507
after the car accident, I realized
that every time these things happened,

1:37:53.540 --> 1:37:56.611
it was always after
I had had a conversation

1:37:56.644 --> 1:38:00.013
with Jeff or been around Jeff
or been on the phone with him.

1:38:00.815 --> 1:38:02.182
It was him.

1:38:03.350 --> 1:38:04.351
It wasn't me.

1:38:06.453 --> 1:38:07.354
It was...

1:38:08.489 --> 1:38:11.191
him or me with
somebody like him.

1:38:13.795 --> 1:38:14.729
Okay.

1:38:16.530 --> 1:38:19.466
You have been
with this boss for six years,

1:38:19.500 --> 1:38:21.268
and ever since
you've been with him,

1:38:22.169 --> 1:38:25.072
literally,
one, two weeks into it,

1:38:25.105 --> 1:38:29.142
you started to change like you
became unhappy and distracted.

1:38:30.244 --> 1:38:31.646
Do you remember
when you cut your hand?

1:38:34.749 --> 1:38:35.617
Sure.

1:38:37.184 --> 1:38:40.320
You had just had a phone
conversation with him

1:38:40.354 --> 1:38:43.725
where he told you that you
messed up a project so badly

1:38:43.758 --> 1:38:46.761
that he actually wondered
if you were retarded.

1:38:48.696 --> 1:38:51.298
- He said that?
- Yeah.

1:38:51.331 --> 1:38:55.102
Mags, he says stuff
like that to you all the time.

1:38:57.271 --> 1:39:00.240
- He does?
- Yes, and you just take it.

1:39:00.274 --> 1:39:03.110
I have never heard
you stand up for yourself

1:39:03.143 --> 1:39:07.447
or defend your work or anything.

1:39:08.549 --> 1:39:10.150
Okay, so my point is...

1:39:11.351 --> 1:39:14.822
is that your boss is to you
what Jeff was to me...

1:39:16.590 --> 1:39:17.558
bad.

1:39:19.727 --> 1:39:22.162
And if we're going to keep being
friends, I need you to fix it.

1:39:22.195 --> 1:39:23.463
I need you to handle it.

1:39:26.701 --> 1:39:28.703
I know.

1:39:29.904 --> 1:39:31.104
I know.

1:40:01.568 --> 1:40:02.469
Jules.

1:40:02.502 --> 1:40:03.437
Yeah.

1:40:06.239 --> 1:40:08.208
You were right.
You're right.

1:40:08.241 --> 1:40:11.545
I've been a miserable cow,
and I'm, uh,

1:40:11.578 --> 1:40:12.847
I think I'm going to quit.

1:40:15.315 --> 1:40:16.483
Hey, um...

1:40:17.652 --> 1:40:19.353
I have an idea.

1:40:19.386 --> 1:40:21.789
I'll... I'll drive
you for moral support.

1:40:23.256 --> 1:40:26.360
Okay, good, yeah.

1:40:26.393 --> 1:40:28.528
I'll, um, I'll meet you outside.

1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:55.555
Okay. So, are you ready?

1:40:55.589 --> 1:40:57.591
- I think so.
- What are you going to say?

1:40:57.625 --> 1:41:02.429
I'm going to tell him
that I quit. That I'm done.

1:41:02.462 --> 1:41:04.498
- Okay.
- What?

1:41:04.531 --> 1:41:07.501
I just think that you should
tell them how you really feel.

1:41:09.603 --> 1:41:12.205
- I'm proud of you.
- Well,

1:41:12.239 --> 1:41:14.742
I mean, I haven't done it yet,
and I'm sweating like a pig.

1:41:14.776 --> 1:41:17.210
And I didn't sleep
at all last night. So...

1:41:17.244 --> 1:41:18.578
Hey, you're going to do great.

1:41:18.613 --> 1:41:20.915
I'm right here.
I'm your getaway car.

1:41:22.382 --> 1:41:23.951
Mags, don't cry.

1:41:31.525 --> 1:41:32.426
All right.

1:41:33.995 --> 1:41:34.962
Okay.

1:42:03.925 --> 1:42:05.626
Why are you dressed so casual?

1:42:06.627 --> 1:42:08.528
Is it casual Friday?

1:42:08.562 --> 1:42:09.964
No.

1:42:12.834 --> 1:42:15.803
What's going on? Are you
on your period or something?

1:42:17.772 --> 1:42:21.241
No. I just... I wanted...

1:42:23.410 --> 1:42:25.345
You got
the Harris proposal, right?

1:42:25.378 --> 1:42:27.749
Yeah, sure.

1:42:27.782 --> 1:42:29.349
Great.

1:42:29.382 --> 1:42:30.985
Are you okay?

1:42:33.553 --> 1:42:37.024
Yeah, totally.
Totally, I'm great.

1:42:37.058 --> 1:42:38.659
Okay.

1:42:55.042 --> 1:42:56.343
How'd it go?

1:42:57.477 --> 1:43:00.081
- Great.
- What happened?

1:43:00.114 --> 1:43:02.950
Um, well, I...

1:43:04.018 --> 1:43:05.720
- I don't know.
- Maggie!

1:43:05.753 --> 1:43:08.588
- What the hell?
- I tried.

1:43:08.623 --> 1:43:10.557
I just... I couldn't do it.

1:43:10.590 --> 1:43:14.629
And... and, you know what?
I can send it in an email.

1:43:14.662 --> 1:43:17.632
- It will be easier.
- I knew it.

1:43:17.665 --> 1:43:19.033
That's it.

1:44:02.576 --> 1:44:03.711
We'll have to talk about it.

1:44:03.744 --> 1:44:04.846
Hi, there.

1:44:10.651 --> 1:44:14.088
I... I'm going to have to... I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to call you back.

1:44:18.159 --> 1:44:19.627
Hi.

1:44:19.660 --> 1:44:21.461
Mags here has something

1:44:21.494 --> 1:44:22.730
she would like to tell you.

1:44:23.798 --> 1:44:25.465
And who are you?

1:44:25.498 --> 1:44:26.767
You don't want to know.

1:44:27.935 --> 1:44:28.870
Mags?

1:44:34.474 --> 1:44:36.777
Mags would like to
tell you that she's quitting.

1:44:38.079 --> 1:44:39.013
Right, Mags?

1:44:41.082 --> 1:44:43.918
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,

1:44:43.951 --> 1:44:47.788
I, um, I'm done.
I've decided to quit.

1:44:47.822 --> 1:44:49.624
So I'm quitting.

1:44:51.125 --> 1:44:55.730
And she would also like to tell you
that you are a very horrible person,

1:44:55.763 --> 1:44:59.066
a very mean boss and that
you should work on that.

1:45:00.600 --> 1:45:01.568
Right, Mags?

1:45:01.601 --> 1:45:03.704
Yeah. Yes.

1:45:04.939 --> 1:45:08.575
You need to work on your
people skills. Yeah.

1:45:12.613 --> 1:45:15.116
What goes around comes around.

1:45:15.149 --> 1:45:18.518
And you have
a very bad vibes, man.

1:45:22.589 --> 1:45:25.159
Okay. Mags also wants to
tell you some other things.

1:45:25.192 --> 1:45:29.797
What... What? I don't know,
it's just... yeah, that's it.

1:45:29.830 --> 1:45:32.532
Yeah, I quit. I'm good.

1:45:32.565 --> 1:45:34.635
I... that's... that's it.

1:45:35.736 --> 1:45:39.472
Wow. So, you needed to
bring in your lesbian friend

1:45:39.506 --> 1:45:40.975
to help you with this?

1:45:43.144 --> 1:45:45.578
Yeah, you know,
see that's what he does.

1:45:45.613 --> 1:45:48.916
He sort of... I don't know,
makes those little jabs

1:45:48.950 --> 1:45:51.551
to make someone feel like a
little piece of... you know what.

1:45:51.584 --> 1:45:55.623
You know what? You're
the piece of you know what.

1:45:55.656 --> 1:45:59.093
You're horrible.
You're horrible!

1:45:59.126 --> 1:46:01.762
You're horrible
to the women in this office.

1:46:01.796 --> 1:46:04.865
You... you... you treat
your wife like crap,

1:46:04.899 --> 1:46:08.803
and she's like the sweetest,
most beautiful person.

1:46:08.836 --> 1:46:12.173
God! You know,
and I hate this plant.

1:46:12.206 --> 1:46:14.108
- I hate it.
- She hates it.

1:46:14.141 --> 1:46:20.781
I hate it so much. I'm so sick
of looking at that stupid plant.

1:46:21.816 --> 1:46:25.753
And I'm so... I don't know,
like, I just wish

1:46:25.786 --> 1:46:28.889
people like you
would be put away

1:46:28.923 --> 1:46:31.792
so you can't infect
the world with your cruelty

1:46:31.826 --> 1:46:34.128
and your sarcasm.

1:46:36.163 --> 1:46:39.100
- And I deserved a promotion.
- She deserved a promotion.

1:46:40.101 --> 1:46:41.202
I did.

1:46:41.235 --> 1:46:45.206
I worked nights,
I work weekends.

1:46:45.239 --> 1:46:47.274
I barely saw my friends.

1:46:47.308 --> 1:46:48.809
And you...

1:46:49.810 --> 1:46:52.579
you didn't even
let me go see my grandfather...

1:46:53.647 --> 1:46:55.049
when he was in hospice.

1:46:56.117 --> 1:46:58.719
You are so fired.

1:47:03.190 --> 1:47:05.558
I quit first.

1:47:05.592 --> 1:47:11.832
I quit...
first, asshole!

1:47:11.866 --> 1:47:16.737
Don't you get it?
What is wrong with you?

1:47:16.771 --> 1:47:18.973
Oh, my God. And I don't
even care that there's, like,

1:47:19.006 --> 1:47:24.145
a million women who are waiting
in the wings to take my job.

1:47:24.178 --> 1:47:28.049
And I wish I could go on
the nightly news and talk about

1:47:28.082 --> 1:47:32.053
what a sleaze bag you are,
and maybe, I don't know.

1:47:32.086 --> 1:47:34.055
Maybe I should do that.

1:47:35.122 --> 1:47:38.793
And maybe I should
tell your wife all of the...

1:47:38.826 --> 1:47:43.864
horrible things that you've done
that she doesn't know about.

1:47:43.898 --> 1:47:46.133
You threatening me?

1:47:47.301 --> 1:47:48.869
I'll call the cops.

1:47:48.903 --> 1:47:52.673
No. No.
You don't get to do that.

1:47:53.974 --> 1:47:55.076
I think it's called...

1:47:56.310 --> 1:47:57.978
blackmail.

1:47:58.012 --> 1:48:00.181
I know so much about you.

1:48:00.214 --> 1:48:03.084
You have no idea what I know.

1:48:03.984 --> 1:48:06.053
I think he knows.

1:48:06.087 --> 1:48:07.154
What do you know?

1:48:09.023 --> 1:48:10.691
Everything.

1:48:10.724 --> 1:48:12.693
I'll put it
all over social media.

1:48:12.726 --> 1:48:16.263
Every girl you screwed
on a work vacation.

1:48:16.297 --> 1:48:19.033
Every client
you destroyed

1:48:19.066 --> 1:48:21.335
when you got off the...
what are you doing? Stop it.

1:48:21.368 --> 1:48:24.405
Every client you destroyed when
you got off the phone with them.

1:48:24.438 --> 1:48:27.908
How about all the money
you stole from the company

1:48:27.942 --> 1:48:30.177
that the accountant
doesn't even know about?

1:48:30.211 --> 1:48:33.681
I could destroy you...
stop it, Jules. I'm not done.

1:48:33.714 --> 1:48:36.283
- You're not... you're done.
- All of it.

1:48:36.317 --> 1:48:39.053
I could destroy you and
your company in one day, man.

1:48:39.086 --> 1:48:42.189
I'm serious. One day.

1:48:42.223 --> 1:48:44.825
I see you! Jules, I'm not done.

1:48:44.859 --> 1:48:47.995
- You're done.
- I have more to say to him. Why are you pulling me?

1:48:48.028 --> 1:48:50.231
I can see you.
I see you in there.

1:48:50.264 --> 1:48:55.769
Your smog, horrible face.
I hate that face. I hate it!

1:48:55.803 --> 1:48:57.838
Jules! Jules?

1:48:57.872 --> 1:49:00.808
Oh, guys. You hear me?

1:49:00.841 --> 1:49:03.043
You don't put up with
any bullshit from him, okay?

1:49:03.077 --> 1:49:06.914
You call Mr. Levine,
he's an amazing attorney.

1:49:06.947 --> 1:49:10.951
His number's 1-800-444-HELP!

1:49:15.022 --> 1:49:16.991
Show's over. Go back to work.

1:49:23.264 --> 1:49:24.265
What?

1:49:24.298 --> 1:49:27.368
- That was...
- So good!

1:49:27.401 --> 1:49:30.204
I mean, that was so good.

1:49:30.237 --> 1:49:34.808
- That felt so good.
- I don't think you needed to blackmail him.

1:49:34.842 --> 1:49:37.077
Well, you know,
I mean that just came out

1:49:37.111 --> 1:49:39.346
in the heat of the moment.
I mean...

1:49:39.380 --> 1:49:40.948
- I get it.
- Yeah.

1:49:40.981 --> 1:49:43.884
Ah, I should do
that more often, right?

1:49:43.918 --> 1:49:46.487
Mr. Peters told me to tell you

1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:50.191
to not forget to send
the Johnson report in.

1:49:50.224 --> 1:49:54.261
Tell Mister Peters
to go fuck himself.

1:49:54.295 --> 1:49:58.332
He also said that
your laptop is company property.

1:49:58.365 --> 1:50:00.968
Holy shit, this guy!

1:50:01.001 --> 1:50:03.871
- Yeah, he is...
- Such a... Oh, my...

1:50:14.181 --> 1:50:15.082
Woah!

1:50:48.916 --> 1:50:51.952
I keep expecting the... cops

1:50:51.986 --> 1:50:55.055
- to, like, knock at my door.
- They won't.

1:50:59.059 --> 1:51:00.060
You did it.

1:51:02.062 --> 1:51:03.530
You went in there and...

1:51:04.865 --> 1:51:07.101
stood up for yourself.

1:51:09.103 --> 1:51:10.971
I did. Didn't I?

1:51:13.073 --> 1:51:15.376
I kind of sunk
to his level though.

1:51:22.149 --> 1:51:23.417
What?

1:51:23.450 --> 1:51:25.552
I just...

1:51:25.586 --> 1:51:28.822
keep thinking about when
you knocked that plant over.

1:51:38.265 --> 1:51:40.067
That was so stupid.

1:51:49.243 --> 1:51:50.477
Oh, my God.

1:51:58.018 --> 1:51:59.320
Now what, Jules?

1:52:02.489 --> 1:52:03.957
Whatever you want.

1:52:06.126 --> 1:52:09.129
The world's yours.

1:52:15.436 --> 1:52:16.403
I got to go.

1:52:23.645 --> 1:52:25.012
We exploded it.

1:52:25.913 --> 1:52:28.549
Yeah, girl.

1:52:34.656 --> 1:52:35.923
This is good.

1:52:37.291 --> 1:52:39.627
- It's not done.
- Yeah, but it's good.

1:52:45.399 --> 1:52:46.400
I'm here...

1:52:48.636 --> 1:52:49.937
whatever you need.

1:52:51.572 --> 1:52:52.506
I know.

1:52:53.574 --> 1:52:55.409
I love you, Jules.

1:52:58.379 --> 1:53:00.013
Love you back.

1:53:15.630 --> 1:53:18.465
That would be great.
Yeah, thank you.

1:53:18.499 --> 1:53:21.602
Hello!

1:53:21.636 --> 1:53:23.604
- Hello!
- You're here!

1:53:25.506 --> 1:53:28.976
- It is going so well.
- I know.

1:53:29.009 --> 1:53:30.645
It's pretty awesome, isn't it?

1:53:30.678 --> 1:53:33.113
I've already sold
half of my paintings.

1:53:33.147 --> 1:53:35.516
- I mean, of course, you have. Look at it.
- Oh, no.

1:53:35.549 --> 1:53:37.217
You're so sweet.

1:53:37.251 --> 1:53:39.086
- Oh, you see that one over there?
- Yeah.

1:53:39.119 --> 1:53:43.323
Nobody's buying it
which is kind of the point.

1:53:43.357 --> 1:53:45.693
I put sold sticker on it,

1:53:45.727 --> 1:53:48.061
because I wanted
to give it to you.

1:53:48.095 --> 1:53:50.130
- Want to go see it? Okay.
- Yes!

1:54:06.313 --> 1:54:09.116
- To Maggie, the most badass girl that we know.
- Aw.

1:54:09.149 --> 1:54:12.186
To Maggie,
here's to defeating evil

1:54:12.219 --> 1:54:13.688
- before it kills you.
- Oh.

1:54:13.721 --> 1:54:17.558
Well, thank you.
Cheers to all of us.

1:54:17.591 --> 1:54:21.028
And of course,
this party is, of course,

1:54:21.061 --> 1:54:24.498
for this which is very exciting.

1:54:24.531 --> 1:54:27.601
But also, because
I decided to put you both

1:54:27.635 --> 1:54:29.303
on the deed of the cabin.

1:54:29.336 --> 1:54:32.339
- So this cabin is half yours.
- You did what?

1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:35.342
It took a lot to get him here.

1:54:35.375 --> 1:54:37.478
Yeah.

1:54:47.387 --> 1:54:49.089
Hey!

1:54:50.424 --> 1:54:53.494
- No, Maggie. I invited them.
- Why?

1:54:53.527 --> 1:54:55.763
Everyone deserves
a second chance, Maggie.

1:54:55.797 --> 1:54:58.065
Even them?

1:54:58.098 --> 1:55:00.768
- Even you.
- Oh, even me?

1:55:01.769 --> 1:55:02.737
All right.

1:55:03.771 --> 1:55:05.439
We're clean, all right?

1:55:05.472 --> 1:55:06.573
- I promise.
- All right.

1:55:06.608 --> 1:55:08.342
Yeah, all right!

1:55:08.375 --> 1:55:10.477
Okay. All right.

1:55:11.512 --> 1:55:13.480
Hey. Thank you!
