[Episode 8: Tobeol]

00:27.060 --> 00:28.960
[To eliminate by force]

00:54.620 --> 00:55.750
[Is this the right path?]

00:57.120 --> 00:58.490
[Or maybe it is not.]

01:00.420 --> 01:02.820
[Was I not here earlier?
Could I be wrong?]

01:03.090 --> 01:04.730
[Should I go that way?]

01:07.230 --> 01:09.400
[Why do these paths all look the same?]

01:10.030 --> 01:11.370
[Let me see.]

01:11.570 --> 01:13.270
[Is it this way? Maybe not.]

01:13.970 --> 01:16.539
[What? Another path into the woods?]

01:17.470 --> 01:19.970
[Why do all paths lead to the woods?]

01:20.940 --> 01:22.910
-Bunno as in rage.
-Four hundred thirty-two...

01:22.980 --> 01:24.150
Nodong as in labor.

01:25.310 --> 01:27.320
-Dongmul as in animal.
-And three.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.620
A word that begins with "mul"?

01:30.220 --> 01:32.490
-Mulddae as in water spot.
-Ddae?

01:33.789 --> 01:35.190
Forget it!

01:37.759 --> 01:39.990
What are we even doing out here?

01:42.960 --> 01:44.900
You know what? I am done with this.

01:45.530 --> 01:47.370
Same here. Count me out.

01:51.910 --> 01:53.140
Darn it!

01:54.009 --> 01:56.539
My lord, why on earth

01:56.610 --> 01:58.680
are you punishing us?

01:58.810 --> 02:00.380
The number of furrows,

02:00.450 --> 02:01.880
aconites,

02:01.950 --> 02:03.350
and the width of the fields.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.850
Get back to me with the exact number.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.420
But

02:07.520 --> 02:09.789
why must we go to such lengths?

02:09.990 --> 02:12.760
I will need those numbers
to write up a report.

02:13.260 --> 02:15.700
Besides, this has to do
with the late Crown Prince.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.970
[There is no room for error.]

02:19.170 --> 02:22.470
Could you not have at least
given us a few helping hands?

02:24.070 --> 02:25.710
This operation is top secret.

02:26.110 --> 02:27.579
Thus, I cannot trust random people.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.980
Do you even hear
the nonsense you are saying?

02:31.050 --> 02:34.020
Why must the two of us
be the only ones to suffer?

02:34.079 --> 02:35.320
Calm down already.

02:36.180 --> 02:38.990
Get back to it then.
Take breaks when you can,

02:39.190 --> 02:40.490
but get it done as soon as possible.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.320
Where are you going?

02:43.390 --> 02:45.530
We will not do this!

02:45.590 --> 02:47.530
I will write a formal complaint
to His Majesty.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.060
But the order came from your master.

02:49.130 --> 02:51.300
One cannot agree to
the exploitation of labor.

02:51.370 --> 02:54.540
No. No! Darn it!

02:58.010 --> 02:59.110
So where were we?

03:02.140 --> 03:04.750
You started measuring from over there

03:04.810 --> 03:07.320
while I covered this area.

["Seonghosaseol"]

[Kang Han-ki, October 10, Yeomcho]

04:13.350 --> 04:14.720
Yeomcho?

04:16.779 --> 04:18.450
That is gunpowder, right?

04:19.950 --> 04:22.260
What did you just say? "Yeomcho"?

04:23.060 --> 04:24.560
It was true.

04:24.730 --> 04:26.030
The talk about gunpowder.

04:26.830 --> 04:29.500
Look. On top of stealing the tributes
for the King,

04:29.560 --> 04:30.930
they even traded gunpowder.

04:31.730 --> 04:35.340
My goodness.
They sure are not petty thieves.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.610
What do these letters mean?

04:40.170 --> 04:42.140
-"Mido."
-"Mido"?

04:42.210 --> 04:43.240
What is that?

04:43.310 --> 04:44.710
[Mido]

04:43.310 --> 04:46.350
This means a tail, and this means
an island. A location, perhaps?

04:48.350 --> 04:49.620
A tail island?

04:50.850 --> 04:52.650
My goodness! Who is it?

04:52.720 --> 04:54.590
I shall beat you up!

Oh, boy.

05:08.540 --> 05:09.570
My lord.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.440
Are you all right?

05:15.740 --> 05:18.380
-Water. I need more water.
-Sure, no problem.

05:28.060 --> 05:31.190
What? So you just came back?

05:33.060 --> 05:34.730
The terrain is much rougher
than I expected.

05:34.830 --> 05:37.900
And all the paths twist and turn.
It is like a maze there.

05:34.830 --> 05:37.900
[Sokgwi: A maze]

05:39.000 --> 05:40.840
They are evil scoundrels,

05:40.900 --> 05:44.340
but I must say they built their hideout
in a perfect spot.

05:45.610 --> 05:48.010
What will you do now?

05:49.080 --> 05:51.510
I was going to request backup
once I had located the hideout.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.820
However, I am already delayed,

05:54.250 --> 05:57.190
so I should reach out to the post station
or the nearest outpost.

05:57.350 --> 05:59.820
But you said all the officials
must be in on it too.

06:03.060 --> 06:06.360
I noticed on my way in
that you have all sorts of things.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.930
Do you happen to trade
medicinal herbs too?

06:10.130 --> 06:12.270
No, we do not deal with medicinal herbs.

06:12.670 --> 06:16.100
The officer in charge is
way too strict and thorough.

06:16.270 --> 06:18.140
It is a nuisance to deal with him.

06:19.210 --> 06:20.980
There must be someone who is not.

06:21.740 --> 06:23.750
The officer in charge
is in the Office of Stipend.

[Gwanggeungchang:

06:24.750 --> 06:27.550

I know where that is.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.650
It is actually not far from here.
I will take you there.

06:32.790 --> 06:33.820

-Have you gone mad?
-Darn you.

-You let go first.

-Relax. It is okay.

-Wait!

Please excuse us.

What about the woman who was with him?
What happened to her?

10:22.620 --> 10:23.780
What are you saying?

10:24.090 --> 10:26.150
You are avoiding the topic
because you killed him.

10:26.850 --> 10:29.090
We know you did it. Someone witnessed it.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.130
No, you are wrong.
Do you even know who our master is?

10:32.190 --> 10:34.930
He is the junior sixth counselor
in the Office of Special Counselors.

That is correct.

It is true that I had arrested him
during my investigation,

10:56.480 --> 10:58.820
He was supposed to be sent

on your way back,

and overheard everything.

Hurry up and release them!

15:49.640 --> 15:50.710
Gosh!

15:51.950 --> 15:54.480
Where is the mine? Where is it?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.920
Search the place. Search it!

16:00.890 --> 16:04.090
What an intense greeting this is.

16:04.390 --> 16:06.290
How did you know we were here?

16:06.390 --> 16:08.430
Tae-seo, did you tell him?

16:08.600 --> 16:11.600
No. I would like to know that too.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.470
How did you get here?

16:14.700 --> 16:16.870
What brings the important son
of the minister

16:16.940 --> 16:18.840
to this shabby mountain?

16:19.040 --> 16:21.880
You see, because you did not tell me,

16:22.210 --> 16:24.410
I went through a lot to find this place.

16:24.910 --> 16:26.680
You always

16:27.210 --> 16:28.750
make a big thing out of nothing.

16:30.020 --> 16:32.390
You should watch your mouth.

16:32.450 --> 16:35.260
How can the young master
of high birth's education

16:35.320 --> 16:37.760
be so messed up?

16:38.330 --> 16:39.590
How dare

16:40.860 --> 16:43.830
a son of a concubine talk to me!

16:48.240 --> 16:51.970
Who are you to talk to me?

16:57.880 --> 16:59.250
My apologies.

16:59.980 --> 17:02.420
We have many times been fooled
by fake inspectors,

17:02.680 --> 17:04.150
so I jumped to conclusions right away.

17:05.020 --> 17:09.060
No, I was more than relieved
you did not cover up the murder.

17:11.089 --> 17:12.960
Please lead the way with the officials.

17:14.089 --> 17:17.160
Do you know anything about the lady

17:17.230 --> 17:18.630
who was with that body?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.200
No, I have heard nothing.

17:26.369 --> 17:28.910
I went up the mountains to find
the entrance of Baekgwiryeong,

17:29.840 --> 17:32.950
but failed and came back down
due to the complex road.

17:35.120 --> 17:38.150
It was not due to the complex road. He has
always been bad at finding the direction.

17:40.350 --> 17:43.490
Do you know the way to the top?

17:43.960 --> 17:45.090
Well...

17:46.730 --> 17:48.730
Grandpa Sol, come over here.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.730
Yes, my lord.

17:56.170 --> 17:58.810
He is a plant digger who knows
Baekgwiryeong like the back of his hands.

17:58.940 --> 18:00.040
You can trust him.

18:01.110 --> 18:03.210
He is someone
on a mission of great importance,

18:03.510 --> 18:06.210
so guide him to the top
of the mountain. Please.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.320
Understood, my lord.

18:08.720 --> 18:13.390
But many people are going up
to the top of the mountain today.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.960
Interesting, is it not?

18:17.260 --> 18:18.390
What do you mean?

18:18.790 --> 18:20.360
Did you bump into someone else?

18:25.630 --> 18:28.340
[I saw a group of people with knives.]

18:29.170 --> 18:30.200
Darn it.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.010
Darn it!

18:33.070 --> 18:35.210
[And a young lady.]

18:35.280 --> 18:36.740
How much further do we need to go?

18:36.910 --> 18:38.380
We are almost there.

18:40.010 --> 18:42.850
[She seemed to be a shaman.]

18:44.890 --> 18:45.920
By shaman...

18:45.990 --> 18:48.490
My lord, is that not Bi-ryeong?

18:48.890 --> 18:50.820
Bi-ryeong could have been taken captive.

18:52.430 --> 18:54.500
We should not have left Bi-ryeong behind.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.870
We should have stopped her back then.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.230
Goodness, Bi-ryeong.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.670
I heard she is your new mistress.

19:34.130 --> 19:36.400
I did not say that. What mistress?

19:39.040 --> 19:40.010
Look.

19:40.410 --> 19:42.810
Do you take him for a man who would
order a mere female subordinate

19:42.880 --> 19:45.180
to work and even let her know
of his mine house?

19:45.950 --> 19:48.080
It is clear something
is going on between you two.

19:52.390 --> 19:53.720
You are wrong!

19:56.290 --> 19:58.130
Have you been fooled all this time?

19:58.290 --> 20:00.330
The Spirit is watching you all!

20:00.960 --> 20:03.100
At this rate, none of you will escape
the divine retribution!

20:03.860 --> 20:06.330
Punishment aside,

20:06.770 --> 20:08.370
you look familiar.

20:09.470 --> 20:12.170
Is she not the slave
who escaped from our guild?

20:13.270 --> 20:14.910
Remember? When the inspector came,

20:14.980 --> 20:17.080
she shot slingshots with the kids.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.510
What?

20:20.210 --> 20:21.880
So you were working with the inspector?

20:23.550 --> 20:24.920
Goodness.

20:36.830 --> 20:39.230
What did you come here to steal?

20:39.470 --> 20:40.970
You must have something you want.

20:41.770 --> 20:43.970
It slipped my mind.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.670
You catch on fast.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.480
All you have to do is get lost
after handing over everything to me.

20:54.010 --> 20:56.080
Is this mine of yours that important?

20:56.350 --> 20:57.680
But if I utter a word,

20:57.750 --> 21:01.220
the king will order your head to be hung
for treason after you have been beheaded.

21:01.790 --> 21:04.390
Not only that, you will be executed again.

21:07.930 --> 21:10.700
I will take it that you understood me

21:11.970 --> 21:13.300
and take over this place.

21:49.970 --> 21:52.070
Catch her! Catch that wench!

21:52.810 --> 21:54.610
Do not let her get to the inspector!

21:54.680 --> 21:55.880
Catch her!

22:00.410 --> 22:01.450
Stop right there!

22:20.300 --> 22:22.640
Thank you. This is enough.

22:22.770 --> 22:24.170
Understood, my lord.

22:26.970 --> 22:29.680

[Nisan Park Family's Genealogy]

38:40.910 --> 38:43.050
This is beyond insolent.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.820

were commended by kings,

38:45.890 --> 38:49.720
and we have produced reputable scholars
and ministers for over three generations.

and damage the family records?

to say a few words as well.

39:48.110 --> 39:50.180
Despite my unbending loyalty toward you,

39:51.480 --> 39:53.350
you never once acknowledged me.

39:53.450 --> 39:55.450
Thinking I was undeserving
of your validation,

39:55.820 --> 39:57.690
I just blamed myself for it.

39:59.560 --> 40:03.030
All my life, I lived in hiding fearing
that I would harm the family's reputation.

40:03.260 --> 40:04.760
Every day,

40:05.030 --> 40:08.100
I neglected myself to do your bidding.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.100
However,

40:11.770 --> 40:15.010
as if all my wounds
and scars meant nothing,

40:16.340 --> 40:19.850
I even lost the silver mine
I had poured my everything into,

40:23.280 --> 40:26.090
and you say even that is all on me.

40:29.560 --> 40:30.860
What more...

40:32.930 --> 40:34.460
What more

40:36.760 --> 40:37.900
can I

40:38.800 --> 40:40.800
possibly do?

40:44.170 --> 40:45.600
Have you lost your mind?

40:49.880 --> 40:52.780
Hey, did you eat something rotten?

Are you trying
to get yourself killed or what?

Hey! Is there anyone outside...

41:01.090 --> 41:03.290
And you need to stop messing with me now.

41:03.790 --> 41:07.230
You know that it is not like
I cannot kill you. I am kindly

41:07.660 --> 41:09.030
keeping you alive.

I do not know

41:29.450 --> 41:31.880
what has gotten into you,

41:34.050 --> 41:36.560
but I see that
you have chosen your path at last.

41:37.490 --> 41:39.830
My path was decided the moment I was born.

41:40.930 --> 41:43.000
I have only now chosen to accept it.
That is all.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.430
You got caught
trying to collect kickbacks,

41:48.300 --> 41:50.340
and you could have been killed for it.

41:50.500 --> 41:53.640
Do not talk back to your father
and parade as though

you have had an awakening or something.

I am kindly and mercifully
keeping you alive.

Even if you are gone,
no one in the family will care.

42:13.790 --> 42:16.800
However, if you must do away
with our family,

42:17.360 --> 42:20.470
then you will have a very difficult time.

42:25.910 --> 42:27.210
Wait and see.

You will face your demise very soon
anyway.

42:32.080 --> 42:34.010
And as you breathe your last,

42:34.810 --> 42:37.750
you will think of this day
and weep with deep regret.
