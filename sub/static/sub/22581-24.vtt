00:04.364 --> 00:08.406
Captain's personal log.
February 12th, 2152.

00:08.656 --> 00:11.740
After a brief detour,
we're back on course for Risa.

00:11.990 --> 00:14.449
Everyone's looking forward
to some much-needed shore leave.

00:14.658 --> 00:18.407
I've got my eye on a place
called Suraya Bay.

00:18.616 --> 00:20.824
Villas built right into the cliffs.

00:21.075 --> 00:24.825
Perfect spot to enjoy
a few good books.

00:25.076 --> 00:27.951
Might even do a little diving when l...

00:28.368 --> 00:30.410
Computer, pause.

00:31.285 --> 00:32.284
Archer.

00:32.494 --> 00:34.327
We're picking up
a distress call, captain.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.411
It's coming from a vessel
approximately 2 light years to port.

00:37.620 --> 00:42.370
- Any idea who it is?
- No, sir. Should we alter course?

00:43.870 --> 00:47.371
Go ahead. I'll be right there.

00:49.246 --> 00:52.039
Looks like your walk on the beach
will have to wait.

01:00.332 --> 01:05.665
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:08.124 --> 01:11.542
"It's been a long time"

01:11.750 --> 01:15.584
"But my time is finally near"

01:15.792 --> 01:20.043
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:20.251 --> 01:23.169
"I will touch the sky"

01:23.377 --> 01:27.170
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

01:27.377 --> 01:30.378
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

01:30.587 --> 01:35.296
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

01:35.504 --> 01:38.421
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

01:38.629 --> 01:43.213
"I've got faith to believe"

01:43.422 --> 01:46.006
"I can do anything"

01:46.214 --> 01:50.715
"I've got strength of the soul"

01:50.923 --> 01:53.799
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

01:54.008 --> 01:59.341
"I can reach any star"

01:59.717 --> 02:03.467
"I've got faith"

02:03.676 --> 02:07.384
"I've got faith"

02:07.592 --> 02:12.385
"Faith of the heart"

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.099 --> 02:30.935
- Plasma residue?
- Your warp injectors were full of it.

02:31.184 --> 02:33.562
I must be more diligent
about routine maintenance.

02:33.770 --> 02:36.064
Unless you enjoy being adrift
in the middle of nowhere.

02:36.273 --> 02:39.067
Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you
with something this trivial.

02:39.317 --> 02:41.402
Be sure to thank Mr Tucker
for his time.

02:41.611 --> 02:43.237
He wanted me to thank you.

02:43.445 --> 02:46.740
It isn't every day he gets to tinker
with alien engines.

02:46.990 --> 02:49.951
We also found a microfracture
on your starboard hull.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.996
- They're sealing it now.
- Oh, your crew is very thorough.

02:53.204 --> 02:54.706
We were glad to help.

02:54.956 --> 02:57.833
Do you answer
every distress call you pick up?

02:58.083 --> 02:59.919
If we can.

03:00.168 --> 03:03.255
The galaxy could use
more people like you.

03:05.674 --> 03:09.426
Tomorrow you'll join me in my home.
Bring Commander Tucker.

03:09.677 --> 03:13.305
I'll prepare a meal in your honour. It's
the least I can do to show my gratitude.

03:13.513 --> 03:17.141
That's very generous,
but I promised my crew a trip to Risa.

03:17.350 --> 03:19.435
That can wait one more day,
can't it?

03:20.270 --> 03:24.399
If I put them off much longer,
I'm gonna have a mutiny on my hands.

03:24.606 --> 03:26.066
There's going to be a Geskana match.

03:26.275 --> 03:28.735
I doubt you've ever seen
anything like it.

03:28.944 --> 03:30.070
Geskana?

03:30.320 --> 03:34.615
Yes. You might want to participate,
assuming you enjoy competition.

03:36.367 --> 03:40.662
I should warn you, captain,
I am easily offended.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.751
Send me the coordinates.

03:47.001 --> 03:50.504
- I'll break the news to my crew.
- Dress for warm weather.

04:00.764 --> 04:03.306
If it's all the same to you, captain,
I'll sit this one out.

04:03.557 --> 04:05.559
It's not like you
to pass up an away mission.

04:05.809 --> 04:09.354
Well, I'm up to my ears in work. The
impulse manifolds need to be purged,

04:09.562 --> 04:12.357
the gravity plating on C Deck
still isn't aligned.

04:12.565 --> 04:13.775
Trip.

04:13.983 --> 04:15.734
Desert, sir?

04:15.943 --> 04:18.612
The heat, the dry air...

04:19.571 --> 04:21.656
You know how it
sucks the life out of me.

04:21.865 --> 04:24.200
What about the two weeks
we spent in Australia?

04:24.408 --> 04:28.037
- We had a great time.
- Survival training in the outback?

04:28.246 --> 04:31.331
Drinking recycled sweat
and eating snake meat?

04:31.581 --> 04:35.168
- That's your idea of a great time?
- It's not gonna be like that.

04:35.377 --> 04:39.547
I get the feeling Zobral's a man
who likes to indulge his guests.

04:40.215 --> 04:42.424
He's promised to roll out
the red carpet for us.

04:42.675 --> 04:46.387
It'll be more fun
than purging impulse manifolds.

04:48.221 --> 04:51.849
Well, suit yourself.
I'll see if Malcolm's interested.

04:52.100 --> 04:56.437
But I was hoping you'd enjoy
spending some time with your captain.

04:56.728 --> 04:59.147
Promise I won't have to eat
any snake meat?

05:24.295 --> 05:29.091
It's hotter than hell out there.
Forty-one degrees.

05:29.841 --> 05:31.884
It's a dry heat.

05:41.559 --> 05:43.394
Welcome.

05:44.646 --> 05:45.855
Good to be here.

05:46.105 --> 05:48.982
- You remember Commander Tucker?
- Yes, of course, of course.

05:49.191 --> 05:50.692
This is the man
who repaired my ship.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.819
A brilliant engineer.

05:53.070 --> 05:55.948
- It was just a couple clogged injectors.
- Oh, you're far too modest.

05:56.197 --> 05:59.950
Well, I hope you're hungry.
I've prepared quite a feast.

06:02.995 --> 06:05.039
Are there many deserts
on your world?

06:05.289 --> 06:06.624
Quite a few.

06:06.874 --> 06:08.792
But none as big as this one.

06:09.042 --> 06:12.003
From orbit, you'd think
the entire planet's nothing but sand.

06:12.212 --> 06:17.591
Oh, well, we have
a handful of lakes and small seas.

06:18.759 --> 06:20.802
What about Earth?

06:21.011 --> 06:23.054
Two-thirds water.

06:23.263 --> 06:25.306
Extraordinary.

06:25.514 --> 06:28.267
- More wine?
- Please.

06:29.810 --> 06:32.437
- What's that called again?
- Yalasat.

06:32.687 --> 06:36.399
It's made from a cactus
that grows in the northern foothills.

06:36.650 --> 06:40.779
- How is your roast teracaq?
- It's very good.

06:41.070 --> 06:44.365
When Trip and I
did our survival training,

06:44.615 --> 06:47.284
in the desert,
we never ate this well.

06:47.493 --> 06:51.538
I must have lost about 3 kilos
during that last week.

06:51.788 --> 06:54.247
The heat always
takes away my appetite.

06:54.499 --> 06:56.833
Doesn't seem to be
bothering you now.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.711
I guess I'm getting acclimated.

06:59.669 --> 07:03.131
It must be difficult
adjusting to new cultures.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.842
It's challenging at times...

07:06.467 --> 07:07.927
...but that's why we're out here.

07:08.678 --> 07:12.806
- Did you ever think of turning back?
- Only once.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.725
We were attacked by
a hostile species

07:14.932 --> 07:17.061
with a lot more firepower
than Enterprise.

07:17.310 --> 07:21.439
I set a course back to Earth
to upgrade our weapons.

07:22.564 --> 07:25.401
But we ended up
having to do the repairs ourselves.

07:26.359 --> 07:27.778
They haven't bothered us since.

07:28.028 --> 07:29.696
Sounds like you've had
an eventful journey.

07:29.905 --> 07:32.491
It's had its share of surprises.

07:32.699 --> 07:35.951
Well, perhaps your visit here
will be one of them.

07:39.454 --> 07:42.749
Oh, you're going to enjoy this.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.045
- Looks delicious. What is it?
- Blood soup.

07:47.711 --> 07:49.338
I don't usually eat this well,

07:49.547 --> 07:52.633
but I promised your captain
an exceptional meal.

07:53.342 --> 07:56.636
What are these little chunks?

07:57.303 --> 07:59.556
The essence of the male.

08:00.306 --> 08:02.475
Chopped and seasoned.

08:24.368 --> 08:26.954
- Beautiful tapestries.
- Thank you.

08:27.204 --> 08:28.748
Which one do you prefer?

08:34.044 --> 08:36.712
- That one's interesting.
- It's yours.

08:36.962 --> 08:40.424
- No, no, no, no. I couldn't.
- Please, consider it a gift.

08:41.299 --> 08:44.595
You're far too generous. Besides,
I wouldn't have any place to hang it.

08:45.304 --> 08:48.974
Something smaller, then.

08:51.934 --> 08:56.063
I know you would appreciate this.

08:56.314 --> 08:58.064
A Suliban made it.

08:58.273 --> 09:01.401
A Suliban I met several years ago.

09:03.236 --> 09:06.072
Interesting people, don't you agree?

09:08.032 --> 09:09.408
Thank you.

09:10.993 --> 09:13.537
The Geskana match
is about to begin.

09:13.786 --> 09:16.040
I'm hoping you will honour us
by participating.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.582
Now?

09:17.832 --> 09:20.084
I just ate a half a teracaq.

09:20.334 --> 09:25.506
You will be glad you did. Geskana
requires a great deal of strength.

09:58.201 --> 09:59.536
Think you're ready?

10:00.286 --> 10:05.207
- I'll give it a shot, captain.
- I can't promise we'll win any trophies.

10:06.124 --> 10:08.418
This is an ideal game
for men like you.

10:11.421 --> 10:13.046
Thanks.

10:25.975 --> 10:28.269
- We're being hailed.
- The captain?

10:28.519 --> 10:31.897
No, it's coming from a city
on the far side of the desert.

10:32.106 --> 10:33.940
Put it through.

10:35.692 --> 10:37.317
This is Enterprise.

10:37.569 --> 10:40.530
Several hours ago,
you launched a small vessel

10:40.738 --> 10:42.990
to an encampment
in the Cygniai Expanse.

10:43.199 --> 10:44.575
Would you tell me why?

10:45.325 --> 10:48.286
Our captain and chief engineer
were invited.

10:48.494 --> 10:51.748
- By whom?
- A man named Zobral.

10:51.956 --> 10:54.625
- And you are?
- Chancellor Trellit.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.586
Why are you in contact
with this man?

10:58.295 --> 11:01.798
His ship was damaged,
and we assisted him.

11:02.048 --> 11:06.177
- In return, he offered his hospitality.
- Hospitality?

11:06.386 --> 11:08.929
I hope you're aware
that most likely you'll never see

11:09.138 --> 11:11.014
your captain or engineer again.

11:28.446 --> 11:31.533
- You all right?
- Never better.

11:45.086 --> 11:46.879
- Open.
- Open up.

11:47.088 --> 11:48.589
- Block out.
- Here. Here.

11:50.465 --> 11:52.801
Here, here.

11:53.051 --> 11:55.094
Get in front of him.

11:55.679 --> 11:57.388
Cut him off.

11:57.638 --> 11:59.724
Now.

12:08.940 --> 12:10.984
- So close.
- That was a good shot.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.071
Two centimetres to the right,
and you'd have had it.

12:16.279 --> 12:19.574
- Next time, I'll set up a no-look pass.
- All right.

12:24.161 --> 12:27.873
- Archer.
- I need to speak to you, captain.

12:28.457 --> 12:31.751
Can it wait?
We're a little busy at the moment.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.671
It's urgent. Are you alone?

12:35.130 --> 12:37.048
Hold on a minute.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.133
It's my science officer.
She says it's important.

12:40.385 --> 12:43.595
- Do you mind?
- Take your time.

12:44.888 --> 12:46.431
Catch your breath.

12:46.682 --> 12:47.683
What's the problem?

12:47.933 --> 12:50.560
I've been contacted by
a government official in a city

12:50.768 --> 12:53.437
about 200 kilometres
from where you are now.

12:53.688 --> 12:55.898
He claims that you are in danger.

12:56.649 --> 12:57.858
What kind of danger?

12:58.066 --> 13:01.152
According to him,
Zobral and his men are terrorists.

13:01.403 --> 13:03.321
They've been responsible
for numerous attacks

13:03.530 --> 13:05.739
on civilian targets within the city.

13:05.990 --> 13:08.701
Maybe I'm wrong, but they
don't seem like terrorists to me.

13:09.368 --> 13:10.994
Perhaps not.

13:11.245 --> 13:16.041
But until we're certain who they are,
I suggest you return to the ship.

13:21.796 --> 13:23.797
We're on our way.

13:28.468 --> 13:30.178
I hope everything is all right.

13:30.387 --> 13:33.722
The problem with being a starship
captain is you're never really off duty.

13:33.972 --> 13:36.183
I'm afraid we have to
cut our visit short.

13:37.309 --> 13:38.936
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:39.185 --> 13:42.146
- What's going on?
- Problem with the starboard engine.

13:42.397 --> 13:44.482
T'Pol says she needs us
up there right away.

13:45.066 --> 13:46.566
Can't we at least finish this quarter?

13:47.235 --> 13:50.403
Remember those impulse manifolds
you said needed purging?

13:50.988 --> 13:52.823
You were right.

13:54.574 --> 13:57.993
Well, thanks for one hell of a game.

13:58.245 --> 14:01.163
You must have other people
that can correct this problem.

14:01.413 --> 14:02.748
I wish we did.

14:02.957 --> 14:05.962
As I said, captain,
I am easily offended.

14:06.212 --> 14:09.088
We'll come back if there's time.
I promise.

14:09.713 --> 14:12.588
You should not believe
the Torothans.

14:12.839 --> 14:15.464
I have just been informed that we
picked up a lengthy transmission

14:15.672 --> 14:17.881
between your vessel
and Chancellor Trellit.

14:18.089 --> 14:22.215
Whatever he told
your science officer, it is not true.

14:23.048 --> 14:25.549
I wanted this to wait till later,
but I beg you,

14:25.757 --> 14:29.883
let me explain the real reason
why I asked you here.

14:30.133 --> 14:35.717
You have a reputation for being fair,
a man of great integrity.

14:35.968 --> 14:39.677
When you hear what I have to say,
I am certain you will want to help us.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.512
It is called a yrott.

14:51.762 --> 14:55.471
The word means "to stand apart."

14:55.720 --> 14:57.554
When we lived in the cities,

14:57.805 --> 15:01.930
we were forced to wear these
whenever we walked in public.

15:05.056 --> 15:07.097
I take it those days are over.

15:09.598 --> 15:12.265
When the caste system
was finally abolished,

15:12.474 --> 15:15.974
we were led to believe
that everyone would be treated equally.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.224
I remember the celebrations.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.808
Yrotts being burned in the streets.

15:21.017 --> 15:24.933
People saying that we had
finally been granted our rights.

15:25.726 --> 15:29.143
The Torothan clan
signed the accord,

15:29.352 --> 15:31.268
but they never abided by it.

15:31.518 --> 15:35.852
They still control the government,
the lands, the resources, everything.

15:36.102 --> 15:39.895
We spent ten years staging protests,
appealing to the courts,

15:40.103 --> 15:45.270
until finally we realized there was
only one way to get their attention.

15:49.771 --> 15:54.314
And we are going to keep attacking the
Torothans until our voices are heard.

15:54.564 --> 15:57.106
They call us terrorists,

15:57.356 --> 16:01.648
but the truth is they have been
terrorizing us for centuries.

16:01.898 --> 16:05.274
You said you brought me
down here for a reason.

16:06.441 --> 16:09.442
I have a feeling
it wasn't to hear a history lesson.

16:13.525 --> 16:18.693
The Torothans have ten times
as many soldiers as we do.

16:19.401 --> 16:23.360
We won't last much longer
without your help.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.653
I really don't see
what I can do for you.

16:33.070 --> 16:35.320
They said you would be humble.

16:35.529 --> 16:37.779
I scanned your vessel.

16:38.029 --> 16:41.780
You have an arsenal
of powerful weapons.

16:42.030 --> 16:46.447
But more importantly,
I need your wisdom.

16:46.698 --> 16:50.156
Our current strategy isn't working,

16:50.407 --> 16:54.407
but I am confident that together,
we can find one that does.

16:58.366 --> 17:02.659
I would be honoured
to fight alongside you,

17:02.866 --> 17:05.325
as would all of my men.

17:06.242 --> 17:09.451
- What the hell was that?
- Torothan cruisers.

17:09.660 --> 17:12.202
Usually they begin
their bombardment after dark.

17:12.410 --> 17:15.202
They're getting started early today.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.369
I don't know what you heard about me,
but you've been misled.

17:19.619 --> 17:21.994
- What about the Suliban?
- What about them?

17:22.244 --> 17:25.746
You liberated a detention camp,
freed thousands of prisoners.

17:25.954 --> 17:29.121
- Who told you that?
- A Suliban transport captain.

17:29.330 --> 17:32.330
He told me of an explorer
who was also a great warrior.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.955
A man who helped him defeat
an entire army.

17:35.206 --> 17:38.164
Captain Jonathan Archer.

17:38.414 --> 17:41.582
Two cruisers, sir.
They've hit one of our pulse cannons.

17:41.790 --> 17:43.832
Prepare my ship.

17:44.499 --> 17:47.333
This won't last
more than a few hours.

17:48.124 --> 17:52.042
We'll continue this discussion later.
You'll be safe here.

17:52.708 --> 17:54.834
If it's all the same,
we'd rather get to Enterprise.

17:55.042 --> 17:57.709
Oh, your shuttle's thrusters
would draw their attention.

17:57.918 --> 17:59.710
You'd become an easy target.

18:00.627 --> 18:04.461
Please. I wouldn't be a very good host
if I allowed you to get killed.

18:18.379 --> 18:21.255
There's a number of ships
strafing the encampment.

18:22.255 --> 18:23.422
Hail the captain.

18:25.881 --> 18:27.423
Archer.

18:28.131 --> 18:30.173
Captain, are you all right?

18:30.381 --> 18:32.299
We've taken shelter...

18:32.506 --> 18:35.382
- Should be...
- That's the best I can give you.

18:35.591 --> 18:38.049
The entire region is flooded
with jamming signals.

18:38.258 --> 18:40.508
Well, we can't just
leave them down there.

18:40.717 --> 18:44.925
- What about the transporter?
- I can't localize their bio-signs.

18:45.134 --> 18:47.175
I'll take a shuttlepod
and find them myself.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.302
In the middle of an assault?

18:52.885 --> 18:55.510
See if you can find
Chancellor Trellit.

18:58.136 --> 19:00.178
Archer to Enterprise.

19:03.303 --> 19:05.012
Enterprise.

19:05.220 --> 19:07.263
Respond.

19:12.097 --> 19:14.138
Rough game.

19:14.722 --> 19:16.180
That damn midfielder
knocked me down

19:16.389 --> 19:19.139
three times during the last quarter.

19:19.682 --> 19:22.431
I must have bruised
a half a dozen ribs.

19:22.682 --> 19:25.057
Better have Dr Phlox take a look at it
when we get back.

19:30.225 --> 19:33.475
So does the great warrior
have any ideas

19:33.684 --> 19:36.184
about how we're getting out of here?

19:41.601 --> 19:44.685
You're not thinking
about helping these people?

19:46.269 --> 19:49.770
I was thinking about
those Suliban prisoners.

19:51.478 --> 19:53.937
If we hadn't helped them escape,

19:54.395 --> 19:57.063
we wouldn't be in this situation.

19:57.354 --> 20:00.021
T'Pol's ears must be burning.

20:06.356 --> 20:09.231
Want your chief engineer's advice?

20:09.731 --> 20:12.815
- What is it?
- Walk away.

20:13.065 --> 20:15.316
They lured us down here
under false pretences.

20:15.523 --> 20:18.191
And now they're asking us
to help them fight a war?

20:18.399 --> 20:21.900
That's a lot different than breaking
a few innocent people out of prison.

20:22.108 --> 20:25.609
There's just one problem. Zobral.

20:26.067 --> 20:29.568
I get the feeling he's
not gonna take no for an answer.

20:43.528 --> 20:45.362
Come on.

21:01.282 --> 21:02.906
I don't know about you,

21:03.115 --> 21:05.157
but I'd rather take my chances
out in that desert.

21:05.365 --> 21:09.074
- I thought you hated the desert.
- Not tonight.

21:42.917 --> 21:46.002
You neglected to mention that you'd
be attacking the encampment.

21:46.252 --> 21:48.837
And you assured me your people
would be leaving the surface.

21:49.047 --> 21:50.047
Why didn't they?

21:50.297 --> 21:52.965
Captain Archer wanted to speak
with Zobral.

21:53.216 --> 21:57.552
- Interesting. Where are they now?
- I don't know.

21:57.761 --> 22:01.388
If you'd be willing to end your assault,
we could launch a search party.

22:01.639 --> 22:05.767
You expect us to stand by while you
send more people to join Zobral?

22:06.559 --> 22:09.436
If you believe we're assisting
the terrorists, you're mistaken.

22:09.687 --> 22:13.814
Of course, I forgot. They just
went down for the hospitality.

22:14.065 --> 22:17.275
Let us find them,
and we'll leave immediately.

22:17.525 --> 22:19.361
That's what you promised before.

22:19.568 --> 22:23.072
We'll locate your men ourselves,
and deal with them accordingly.

22:23.321 --> 22:25.491
That's assuming they
haven't already been killed.

22:25.740 --> 22:26.741
Chancellor...

22:26.949 --> 22:29.618
If you attempt to launch another
shuttlecraft, we'll have no choice

22:29.826 --> 22:32.245
but to consider it
as an enemy vessel.

22:33.537 --> 22:36.207
I've lost sensor contact
with the surface.

22:36.415 --> 22:38.750
Some kind of orbital-dispersion field.

22:38.999 --> 22:42.169
I can't get any readings
below 100 kilometres.

23:05.020 --> 23:06.854
Two men out in the open.

23:07.063 --> 23:09.065
You'd think they would've
spotted us by now.

23:11.191 --> 23:13.442
We're down here!

23:16.986 --> 23:19.864
You're gonna have to yell
a little louder than that.

23:23.617 --> 23:26.493
You sure we're going
in the right direction?

23:27.578 --> 23:29.830
It was east of the camp.

23:31.122 --> 23:32.957
We're heading east.

23:34.500 --> 23:38.003
- How far?
- About 30 kilometres.

23:38.211 --> 23:40.046
Thirty?

23:41.004 --> 23:43.673
What if we find more
of Zobral's men inside?

23:43.882 --> 23:45.716
It looked abandoned.

23:47.593 --> 23:48.886
All I saw was sand.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.846
I don't remember any buildings.

23:52.054 --> 23:54.723
That's because you forgot
your survival training.

23:55.557 --> 23:59.894
Take a good look on your way in
at your surroundings.

24:00.644 --> 24:05.523
Didn't they also say something
about only walking at night?

24:08.317 --> 24:11.611
Can't we wait
until it cools down a little?

24:11.861 --> 24:13.903
That could be for another...

24:14.738 --> 24:18.657
...eight or nine hours.
We need to find shelter.

24:19.116 --> 24:21.660
- Twenty minutes, captain.
- Trip.

24:25.079 --> 24:26.913
Ten?

24:39.883 --> 24:42.217
To cherry-flavoured snow cones.

24:43.552 --> 24:47.054
What I wouldn't give
for one right about now.

25:01.773 --> 25:04.567
- Do you hear that?
- What?

25:05.151 --> 25:07.110
Sounds like a ship.

25:09.487 --> 25:12.406
- I think the heat's getting to you.
- No.

25:13.490 --> 25:15.325
Listen.

25:18.744 --> 25:20.787
Over there.

25:21.746 --> 25:25.249
- A shuttlepod?
- No.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.752
Something a lot bigger.

25:54.896 --> 25:57.356
- You all right?
- Yeah.

25:57.607 --> 25:59.942
The dispersion field
covers half the continent.

26:00.150 --> 26:02.277
But if I disable these three satellites,

26:02.485 --> 26:05.570
I think I can get a clear reading
of the eastern desert.

26:05.779 --> 26:07.488
That might provoke the Torothans.

26:07.697 --> 26:12.659
I suggest you try to find a less intrusive
way to penetrate their defences.

26:14.744 --> 26:16.788
Why Montana?

26:17.246 --> 26:19.289
Of all the places the Vulcans
could have landed,

26:19.498 --> 26:21.959
they chose Bozeman, Montana.

26:22.208 --> 26:24.584
Humanity's first warp drive
was developed there.

26:24.793 --> 26:26.419
It seemed a logical place to begin.

26:26.628 --> 26:29.172
Well, how did they know
it wouldn't alarm other nations?

26:29.421 --> 26:32.550
An alien species makes contact
with the United States.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.717
Could have made a lot
of other countries nervous.

26:35.593 --> 26:37.219
What's your point?

26:37.470 --> 26:40.638
It seems to me that we're
gonna run into similar problems.

26:40.889 --> 26:42.181
We get invited to dinner,

26:42.390 --> 26:45.225
and before you know it,
we're accused of taking sides in a war.

26:47.686 --> 26:52.730
Contacting new worlds
always involves unexpected risks.

26:52.940 --> 26:58.027
The High Command has very specific
protocols regarding planetary conflicts.

26:58.277 --> 27:03.697
Eventually, Captain Archer will have to
create some directives of his own.

27:38.765 --> 27:40.933
Come on. Come on.

27:41.141 --> 27:44.061
We gotta keep moving. Come on.

27:45.728 --> 27:49.232
My shift doesn't begin
for another six hours.

27:49.899 --> 27:51.942
We're almost there.

27:52.150 --> 27:53.150
Where?

27:54.027 --> 27:56.278
Where are we going?

27:56.987 --> 27:59.447
Nice little place I know.

27:59.739 --> 28:03.492
- Plenty of shade.
- Are there blankets down there?

28:04.409 --> 28:06.535
I'm freezing.

28:09.205 --> 28:11.247
Heat exhaustion.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.916
Come here.

28:17.544 --> 28:22.214
Here. There you go. Easy. Easy.

28:29.220 --> 28:31.263
Here, take mine.

28:31.639 --> 28:33.973
- Go ahead.
- No, sir.

28:34.182 --> 28:37.934
- I won't take another man's water.
- You drink it. That's an order.

28:39.352 --> 28:41.604
Gotta keep moving.

28:41.896 --> 28:43.814
Take the water,
or I'll knock you on your ass,

28:44.022 --> 28:45.440
and pour it down your throat.

28:49.693 --> 28:51.319
Easy.

28:58.824 --> 28:59.825
Thanks.

29:15.338 --> 29:17.589
There's a vessel approaching
from the surface.

29:17.838 --> 29:18.923
It's Zobral.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.175
He's hailing us.

29:23.218 --> 29:26.763
- Open your launch doors. Quickly.
- Is the captain with you?

29:26.971 --> 29:30.140
- Commander Tucker?
- No, no. I'll explain once I'm aboard.

29:30.390 --> 29:31.808
Where are they?

29:32.059 --> 29:36.436
If I'm not in your docking bay in
the next 30 seconds, I'll be detected.

29:36.686 --> 29:39.355
They'll destroy my ship.

29:40.565 --> 29:42.191
Bring him in.

29:44.234 --> 29:46.360
- How many?
- There were 89.

29:46.611 --> 29:50.322
There were only 89 Suliban,
not thousands.

29:50.572 --> 29:53.365
- And the army you defeated?
- I'd hardly call it an army.

29:53.574 --> 29:56.285
It was more like a few dozen
prison guards. And to be honest,

29:56.493 --> 29:58.453
they didn't put up much of a fight.

29:58.703 --> 30:02.080
Jonathan Archer
is an excellent starship captain,

30:02.289 --> 30:06.209
but he's hardly the invincible warrior
described to you.

30:06.876 --> 30:10.086
What about his
legendary desert tactics?

30:10.336 --> 30:13.298
Actually, I'm the tactical officer
on this ship,

30:13.548 --> 30:16.717
and I don't have any experience
at waging desert warfare.

30:17.550 --> 30:20.303
I'm afraid you've come
to the wrong people for help.

30:21.178 --> 30:24.014
All this for nothing.

30:24.264 --> 30:26.098
What about our people?

30:26.348 --> 30:29.809
Well, you have far better sensors
than we do. I'm sure you'll find them.

30:30.059 --> 30:32.103
Our sensors are being disrupted,

30:32.353 --> 30:35.856
and the Torothans have threatened
to fire on us if we launch a shuttlepod.

30:36.106 --> 30:38.441
How did you get here
without them seeing you?

30:38.691 --> 30:41.985
There is a narrow gap
in their orbital detection grid.

30:42.193 --> 30:47.197
It occurs once every 46 minutes, but it
is only open for less than one minute.

30:47.448 --> 30:50.783
- I'll need all the pertinent data.
- You'll need more than that.

30:51.033 --> 30:54.202
The manoeuvres are extremely difficult.
It took us years to learn them.

30:55.662 --> 30:57.329
I'm a quick study.

30:57.580 --> 31:01.207
You will be shot down
before you reach the atmosphere.

31:01.458 --> 31:03.710
With you at the helm,
our chances would improve.

31:03.918 --> 31:06.336
I don't have time.
My men are waiting for me.

31:06.545 --> 31:08.380
Then they'll have to wait
a little longer.

31:08.589 --> 31:10.756
You're the one that got our people
stranded down there.

31:11.007 --> 31:14.301
They are not my responsibility!

31:16.261 --> 31:18.012
You're mistaken.

31:19.513 --> 31:23.224
The Torothans believe
we've joined your cause.

31:23.975 --> 31:26.643
If Captain Archer and
Commander Tucker are apprehended,

31:26.852 --> 31:29.688
they'll undoubtedly be treated
as members of your clan.

31:29.938 --> 31:31.730
They'll become victims
of the same oppression

31:31.939 --> 31:34.275
you've been fighting all these years.

31:35.024 --> 31:39.487
You should feel as responsible for
those two men as you do for your own.

32:27.438 --> 32:29.274
Easy.

32:34.610 --> 32:36.862
Home sweet home.

33:06.802 --> 33:12.180
I hope you're not planning
to hog that all for yourself.

33:17.810 --> 33:19.978
Water's off the menu.

33:33.071 --> 33:35.114
Now this...

33:35.990 --> 33:39.076
...is my idea of a great time.

33:49.250 --> 33:51.085
What'd you do?

33:51.335 --> 33:55.046
Rub two sticks together?

33:56.005 --> 33:59.091
I found a new use
for the stun setting.

34:01.884 --> 34:04.052
It may not taste too good,

34:04.302 --> 34:07.597
but I think I boiled away
anything that can hurt us.

34:07.846 --> 34:09.681
No, thanks.

34:10.264 --> 34:11.891
I'm not thirsty.

34:12.100 --> 34:14.811
Let's not get
into that argument again.

34:24.942 --> 34:28.570
- Worse than blood soup.
- You need water.

34:29.112 --> 34:31.156
What I need...

34:31.947 --> 34:33.992
...is sleep.

34:34.574 --> 34:37.536
You got a fever, Trip.
Your heart's racing.

34:37.786 --> 34:40.330
You got all the symptoms
of heatstroke.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.456
If you fall asleep,
you could lapse into a coma.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.541
A coma?

34:47.001 --> 34:49.252
That sounds nice.

34:50.504 --> 34:52.964
When we get back to Enterprise,
you can sleep all you want.

34:53.215 --> 34:54.632
But right now,

34:54.882 --> 34:58.801
you gotta stay with me,
and drink this water.

34:59.052 --> 35:03.181
If I had a needle, I'd give it to you
intravenously, but I don't.

35:03.930 --> 35:06.600
Come on, sit up.

35:08.184 --> 35:10.018
Here you go.

35:16.939 --> 35:18.776
Good.

35:37.538 --> 35:39.373
Commander.

35:40.791 --> 35:42.626
Aye, captain.

35:44.836 --> 35:47.087
The warp reactor.

35:48.672 --> 35:50.923
Break it down for me.

35:52.925 --> 35:54.551
What?

35:54.760 --> 35:57.512
What are the eight
major components?

35:58.597 --> 36:01.265
You gotta be kidding me.

36:02.099 --> 36:03.934
Name them.

36:05.225 --> 36:07.270
That's an order.

36:10.022 --> 36:11.856
Well...

36:13.732 --> 36:16.401
...there's the drumsticks.

36:17.569 --> 36:19.404
Thighs.

36:20.529 --> 36:22.363
Wings.

36:23.531 --> 36:27.869
- You got anything to eat around here?
- Not at the moment.

36:28.077 --> 36:29.703
But when we get back to Enterprise,

36:29.911 --> 36:34.248
I'll have chef make you a dinner
you'll never forget.

36:34.497 --> 36:38.000
What would you like? Anything.

36:38.418 --> 36:41.295
- Not snake meat.
- No.

36:41.546 --> 36:44.630
Chef doesn't do snake very well.

36:45.882 --> 36:47.924
Tell me what you want.

36:50.176 --> 36:53.887
- Prime rib.
- Okay. What else?

36:54.888 --> 36:57.141
Mashed potatoes.

36:57.390 --> 37:00.893
With mushroom gravy.

37:01.643 --> 37:04.979
The kind he makes
on Wednesday nights.

37:05.229 --> 37:07.063
No problem.

37:08.232 --> 37:10.691
What kind of vegetables?

37:12.192 --> 37:14.445
Hey. Vegetables.

37:15.529 --> 37:17.572
Broccoli.

37:21.992 --> 37:23.827
Dessert?

37:25.703 --> 37:27.954
Pecan pie.

37:37.628 --> 37:39.879
Take another pass
over the eastern basin.

37:40.088 --> 37:41.631
Our sensors
would have detected them.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.674
No, there's magnetic deposits
below that basin.

37:43.883 --> 37:45.510
They could be masking
their bio-signs.

37:45.760 --> 37:48.137
If we increased our altitude,
this would go a lot faster.

37:48.344 --> 37:51.431
We would also risk being detected.

38:06.234 --> 38:08.068
Geography.

38:08.360 --> 38:09.568
Do you know how to play?

38:11.279 --> 38:14.447
- Geography?
- You know.

38:14.656 --> 38:18.993
You say "Amazon River"
which ends in an R,

38:19.243 --> 38:21.035
and then I say "Rhode Island."

38:23.079 --> 38:24.622
We're going to Rhode Island?

38:25.415 --> 38:29.334
No. No, it's a game.

38:29.792 --> 38:34.379
You're supposed to tell me
some place that starts with a D.

38:38.340 --> 38:40.175
D.

38:44.220 --> 38:45.387
Draylax.

38:46.596 --> 38:48.431
X?

38:48.640 --> 38:49.641
X.

38:49.891 --> 38:54.853
- There's always...
- No, no. Don't tell me. I know an X.

38:56.646 --> 38:57.854
Xanadu.

38:59.564 --> 39:01.400
That's not a real place.

39:01.650 --> 39:04.026
- It doesn't matter.
- Of course it matters.

39:04.235 --> 39:06.319
You just used
an alien planet, Draylax.

39:09.863 --> 39:12.407
Easy. Easy. Easy.

39:12.699 --> 39:14.742
Easy. Easy.

39:22.415 --> 39:26.626
All right. Whatever you say.
Xanadu's fine.

39:35.424 --> 39:36.550
Get your head down.

39:36.801 --> 39:39.470
- What?
- Get down.

39:52.646 --> 39:55.940
We gotta get out of here. Come on.

40:00.110 --> 40:01.945
I'm picking up weapons fire
on the surface.

40:02.153 --> 40:05.530
- Ninety kilometres due south.
- A Torothan mortar.

40:05.781 --> 40:07.658
Would they be targeting
one of your settlements?

40:07.865 --> 40:09.492
We don't have any near there.

40:12.203 --> 40:14.079
Set a course, and prepare to fire.

40:16.081 --> 40:19.792
I believe they've located the captain
and Commander Tucker.

40:38.597 --> 40:40.224
Come on.

40:40.431 --> 40:42.058
Come on.

40:44.018 --> 40:45.852
I've got a lock.

40:46.518 --> 40:47.520
Fire.

40:53.274 --> 40:55.108
I see them.

40:55.485 --> 41:00.739
Two humans.
Bearing 115 mark three.

41:08.077 --> 41:10.621
I'm just slowing you down. Go.

41:10.828 --> 41:12.956
I don't remember
taking orders from you.

42:06.829 --> 42:10.957
My launch window opens
in nine minutes. I should be going.

42:11.416 --> 42:14.919
I hope Commander Tucker
is going to be all right.

42:15.419 --> 42:19.547
I doubt I'll ever convince him
to set foot on another desert,

42:19.921 --> 42:20.923
but he'll be fine.

42:22.716 --> 42:27.887
Zobral, even if I were
the warrior you thought I was,

42:28.762 --> 42:31.014
that's not why we're out here.

42:34.309 --> 42:36.351
Captain.

42:37.519 --> 42:39.770
Sub-commander.

43:02.037 --> 43:04.497
What you told him was correct.

43:04.706 --> 43:07.165
Decisions to get involved
in conflicts of other worlds

43:07.374 --> 43:10.252
should be left to governments,
not starship captains.

43:10.460 --> 43:12.128
I know.

43:12.587 --> 43:19.162
The irony is I have the feeling
his cause is worth fighting for.
