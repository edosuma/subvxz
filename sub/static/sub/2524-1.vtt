00:51.051 --> 00:53.969
Everyone in town always
took me for an outsider.

00:54.429 --> 00:55.596
I didn't care.

00:55.764 --> 00:59.224
The only thing that
mattered was her.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.185
She was my garden of Eden.

01:01.186 --> 01:04.646
And God knows how beautiful
it was until that night.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.648
You know, no one is born evil.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.650
The devil himself
was a fallen angel.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.903
But sometimes when
you go through hell...

01:10.904 --> 01:14.531
the only way out is to
walk deeper into the fire.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.116
Are you horny?

01:17.118 --> 01:19.578
Yeah, I'm getting warmer.

01:19.579 --> 01:24.750
Oh. Fine.
No.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.168
Yes.

01:39.182 --> 01:42.893
I'm gonna love you for
the rest of my life.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.316
Just love me for
the rest of mine.

04:02.116 --> 04:04.785
Oh, here he is.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.632
Murderer!

04:22.679 --> 04:24.888
Hey, Ig, what does it feel
like to get away with murder?

04:24.889 --> 04:28.016
Do you
want to comment on the fire at
the lab in Tacoma last night?

04:28.309 --> 04:30.352
Have you heard that the
police have a new witness?

04:30.353 --> 04:33.355
You should ask God to save your
soul for what you did to her!

04:33.356 --> 04:36.650
I should ask the Devil to punish
whoever the fuck killed her.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.509
Hi, this is Lee Tourneau,
leave a message.

05:02.510 --> 05:05.929
Hi, Lee, please can you
meet me at my parents' house

05:05.930 --> 05:08.807
in like half an hour?
I really need to talk to you.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.143
And start picking up
your phone, man. Come on.

05:22.864 --> 05:23.905
Are you proud of me, Mom?

05:23.906 --> 05:27.826
I'm so famous people
follow me everywhere I go.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.912
Come inside, sweetie.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.831
You just can't
talk to those reporters.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.917
They'll take whatever you say
and just twist it around.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.669
But if I don't talk
to them, it looks like

05:37.670 --> 05:40.672
I have something
to hide. Right?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.924
And how's Lee
working out for you?

05:42.925 --> 05:44.384
I mean, you still think
he's up to the job?

05:44.385 --> 05:46.887
Yes. No, he's keeping me
out of jail at least for the

05:46.888 --> 05:49.890
time being... and that's got
to be some kind of triumph.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.892
All right, look,
I know he's an old friend of

05:51.893 --> 05:54.353
yours... but you don't have to
settle for a public defender.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.230
I've got the money. I will hire
you the best lawyer in Seattle.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.940
Dad, every other lawyer we
talked to wanted me to take a

05:58.941 --> 06:02.861
plea. Lee is the only one who
believes I'm innocent.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.909
Just don't talk to any
more reporters, please.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.077
And don't admit anything.

06:10.078 --> 06:14.206
I don't have anything
to admit to, Dad.

06:14.832 --> 06:18.668
Look, honey, we don't
care what happened.

06:18.669 --> 06:22.714
You're our son.
That's all that matters.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.260
Oh, sit back down, Ig.

06:27.261 --> 06:27.969
No, if you think for a second...

06:27.970 --> 06:31.890
that I might have killed her,
then why are you protecting me?

06:31.891 --> 06:36.228
Because if I did anything to
her, then I'm a fucking monster.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.405
Shoot.
I got it, Mom.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.573
Thanks, Ter.

07:20.022 --> 07:23.275
Ig, look, I...
I don't have to go back

07:23.276 --> 07:25.318
on the road next week
if you don't want me to.

07:25.319 --> 07:28.738
Man, you gotta earn a living.
I'll sort things out.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.991
Except I need
you to stay, Terry.

07:30.992 --> 07:34.035
The whole family's gotta put
up a united front for Ig.

07:34.036 --> 07:36.788
- Hey, buddy.
- How's it going?

07:36.998 --> 07:38.707
- Lee.
- Hey.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.585
Lee,
if you want some food,

07:41.586 --> 07:43.170
we have a lot of
leftovers from lunch.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.756
Oh, I grabbed something on the
way over, Mrs. P. Thank you.

07:47.008 --> 07:47.924
How you guys doing?

07:47.925 --> 07:51.720
Yeah, Lee, what happened
at the lab in Tacoma?

07:51.721 --> 07:53.722
One of the reporters this
morning told me it burned down.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.308
Yeah, all the samples from
Merrin's body was destroyed.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.102
It's gonna be tough to recover
any blood or DNA at this point.

07:59.103 --> 08:01.563
But that's a fucking disaster
for us, right? I mean,

08:01.564 --> 08:03.857
that means there's no evidence
that anyone else killed her.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.358
- It's not ideal...
- Fuck.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.068
...but I think it's too soon
to panic at this point.

08:07.069 --> 08:10.280
And who is this new witness?
What is that?

08:10.281 --> 08:12.282
I'm trying to figure
that out today and I'm

08:12.283 --> 08:14.367
also getting your confession
to the police thrown out.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.536
Yeah, good. You know I never
confessed to them. They're just

08:16.537 --> 08:19.706
looking for any way to put me
away for the rest of my life.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.458
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, it's okay.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.918
Lee can fix anything, right?

08:22.919 --> 08:25.295
We'll see about that.
But you know, you don't

08:25.296 --> 08:29.925
have to convince me.
Ig, I believe you.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.510
If you don't think I'm
capable of murder...

08:31.511 --> 08:35.263
just put me in a room with the
guy who really killed her.

08:51.989 --> 08:54.449
A little early for you
to start drinking, ain't it, Ig?

08:54.450 --> 08:57.118
They put me on leave at the
station. Apparently, most

08:57.119 --> 08:59.871
commuters don't like it when
their Dj's a murder suspect.

08:59.872 --> 09:04.376
Yeah, so maybe you should
take your business elsewhere.

09:04.377 --> 09:09.297
No offense, but you make the
other customers uncomfortable.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.592
You telling me I make these
guys feel uncomfortable?

09:12.593 --> 09:16.888
Alright, come on. Iggy deserves
a drink as much as anybody.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.306
Thank you.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.726
More than anybody.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.022
Sorry you have to,
like, stand up for me

09:26.023 --> 09:28.525
all the time now, Glenna.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.698
Listen, Ig, if you're looking
for a friendlier place

09:34.699 --> 09:37.284
to grab a drink,
I get off at five.

09:37.535 --> 09:41.079
I appreciate the
offer, but I should-

09:41.080 --> 09:45.709
I'm probably better off,
like, drinking alone.

10:12.987 --> 10:16.156
Thank you
all for coming tonight to pay

10:16.157 --> 10:19.117
tribute to our dear girl Merrin.

10:19.619 --> 10:25.332
I know that Dale would like to
say a few words to welcome you.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.502
Well...

10:29.503 --> 10:32.047
it's...

10:32.256 --> 10:35.592
It's real good to
see you all here.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.511
The truth is, I haven't
felt much like...

10:38.512 --> 10:42.349
getting out of bed in the
mornings since Merrin...

10:47.188 --> 10:49.147
Ig Perrish...

10:49.899 --> 10:53.568
he murdered her and he is
still walking the streets.

10:55.863 --> 10:59.324
I treated him like a son for
practically all his life...

10:59.325 --> 11:03.036
And then he
killed my little...

11:06.832 --> 11:09.250
my little girl.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.839
As long as he is free,
there is no way that her

11:14.840 --> 11:17.217
soul can be laid to rest.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.972
So let us all bow
our heads in prayer.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.863
Thank you for coming.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.408
Thank you, everybody.

12:33.335 --> 12:34.919
Fuck.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.814
Christ, Ig.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.816
Leave me alone, Glenna.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.902
What are you thinking
coming out here?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.737
People could have seen you.

13:00.738 --> 13:04.282
She went to church
every fucking Sunday!

13:04.283 --> 13:07.702
She wore a cross
around her neck.

13:08.954 --> 13:13.541
And did it make any difference?
No. God turned a blind eye

13:13.542 --> 13:18.004
and let her die out
here alone and afraid.

13:22.802 --> 13:23.885
Come on.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.888
Fucking God!
- Come on, Ig.

13:47.618 --> 13:51.704
For whatever reason,
in this crazy fucked up world,

13:51.705 --> 13:53.790
I was being punished.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.835
When they looked at
me, they saw a devil.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.879
And maybe I did too.

14:02.216 --> 14:05.218
And now I had to look the part.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.739
What the fuck?

15:18.834 --> 15:20.335
What?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.803
Geez!

15:35.392 --> 15:38.519
Let me have him!

15:38.520 --> 15:42.398
Send him down.
Give him to me now!

15:42.399 --> 15:45.944
You were in the bathroom
for a long time.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.489
You still drunk?

15:49.740 --> 15:54.160
How do I look? I mean, do
you notice anything unusual?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.455
You mean horns?

15:57.456 --> 16:00.041
Shit, so they're real?

16:01.335 --> 16:03.002
Fuck!

16:04.380 --> 16:05.964
Hey, Ig?

16:05.965 --> 16:10.051
Can I...
Can I have another donut?

16:10.052 --> 16:12.470
Why are you asking me?

16:12.471 --> 16:16.391
One, two, three, four...

16:16.392 --> 16:18.810
five, six.

16:18.811 --> 16:23.231
Do you think it'd be okay
if I had six more donuts?

16:23.232 --> 16:26.150
Yeah. Do whatever you like.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.277
Thank you.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.608
I didn't like it.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.280
My stomach hurts.

17:16.617 --> 17:18.161
Should I have another one?

17:18.162 --> 17:20.829
Why will you have another if
your stomach hurts, Glenna?

17:20.830 --> 17:23.790
Because I wanna get really fat.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.460
I'm worthless anyways.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.713
Nobody will screw me without
being totally drunk.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.424
Everybody in this town
thinks that I'm trash.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.884
Come on, Glenna.
That's not true.

17:32.885 --> 17:36.971
You wouldn't have screwed me
if you weren't blind drunk.

17:36.972 --> 17:37.472
Well...

17:37.473 --> 17:41.559
And I know you were thinking
about Merrin the whole time.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.897
Glenna, you know, I have
no excuse for last night.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.525
I just need to know if I can
eat the rest of this box.

17:49.526 --> 17:52.570
Yeah, go ahead.
Pig out.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.742
I think I'm just
gonna go, Glenna.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.660
Yeah. Thank you.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.829
All right.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.726
Be quiet!

18:24.728 --> 18:28.606
I said stop it!
Stop it and read your book.

18:28.607 --> 18:29.023
Hi.

18:29.024 --> 18:29.857
What can I do for you?

18:29.858 --> 18:35.071
Yeah, I need Dr. Renald
to look at something.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.534
Well...

18:39.827 --> 18:43.246
that sure doesn't look right.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.582
I'm gonna need you to
fill out some forms.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.092
Stop it.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.302
I said be quiet!

18:58.303 --> 19:00.847
Go over there and
read your book.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.099
Growth.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.685
You know, for what it's worth...

19:05.686 --> 19:10.857
I'd like to kick my daughter
right in her spoiled ass.

19:12.609 --> 19:13.484
Do you think I should?

19:13.485 --> 19:17.697
No, of course not. Of course.
Why would you even ask me that?

19:18.907 --> 19:23.411
Maybe I should just leave
her here and drive away.

19:23.537 --> 19:26.122
Divorce my husband.

19:26.832 --> 19:30.209
I could fuck my golf pro again.

19:30.210 --> 19:30.793
Excuse me?

19:30.794 --> 19:32.670
I'd never been with
a jigaboo before.

19:32.671 --> 19:36.591
But it's true what they
say about black cocks.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.594
I call it my five iron.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.307
Here you go.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.727
I feel like I
have to yell at that girl's

19:47.728 --> 19:50.229
mother. I know it's not her
fault that her daughter's

19:50.230 --> 19:54.192
a screechy puke,
but really now.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.652
Go ahead. Why not?

19:57.404 --> 19:59.947
Ma'am? Do you
think you could show some

19:59.948 --> 20:03.075
fucking consideration and take
your daughter out of here

20:03.076 --> 20:06.746
so we don't have to
listen to her screaming?

20:06.872 --> 20:07.914
What did you just say to me?

20:07.915 --> 20:11.209
I said you should take that
screeching pig of yours

20:11.210 --> 20:15.421
by the hair and drag her
the fuck out of here.

20:15.422 --> 20:16.005
Fuck you!

20:16.006 --> 20:18.716
Shut the hell up, you
dried up old twat!

20:18.717 --> 20:20.134
Hey, you don't
want to do this in front

20:20.135 --> 20:22.553
of your daughter.
Come on.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.657
I hate
Mommy. I wanna burn her in

20:42.658 --> 20:47.703
her bed with matches. I wanna
burn her up all up gone!

21:07.349 --> 21:09.642
You may want to stop
pumping that now.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.644
Sorry.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.773
My boyfriend's seeing
this girl on the side.

21:15.774 --> 21:19.777
She works at the Bradlees
down by the Marina.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.779
I'm thinking on my lunch
hour I should drive over there

21:21.780 --> 21:26.450
and key her Saab. And put
dog shit on the driver's seat.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.829
Or maybe I should just take
a dump on the seat myself.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.624
Ignatius Perrish.
Long time no see.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.041
Hey.

21:34.042 --> 21:37.169
So, what brings you
in here this morning?

21:37.170 --> 21:42.133
Well, can you see anything
that might be wrong with me?

21:42.509 --> 21:44.385
You mean besides your horns?

21:44.386 --> 21:45.970
Well, no, that's
exactly what I mean.

21:45.971 --> 21:46.721
So you can see them?

21:46.722 --> 21:49.098
Well, shouldn't you both
be shocked or something?

21:49.099 --> 21:52.852
I think if I saw someone with
horns, I'd piss down my leg.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.895
Well, they're kinda
hard to remember.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.982
I mean, every time I look
away from you for a second...

21:57.983 --> 22:01.235
I kinda forget that
you even have them.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.863
Okay, but what are they?
I mean, do you, you know...

22:03.864 --> 22:05.906
do you think they could
they be cancerous?

22:05.907 --> 22:09.118
Could they be some weird
tumor or something?

22:09.119 --> 22:13.622
Well, they're definitely
cause for concern.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.167
They look inflamed.
Do they hurt?

22:16.168 --> 22:18.669
Oh! Yes, like hell.

22:22.924 --> 22:26.886
All right. You know how
I think we should proceed?

22:27.387 --> 22:27.803
How?

22:27.804 --> 22:30.890
I think I should grind me up
some OxyContin and have a little

22:30.891 --> 22:33.809
snort. I mean, I'd share. We
could get fucked up together.

22:33.810 --> 22:37.938
No! Please, can you just focus
on my problem for a second?

22:37.939 --> 22:41.817
Okay. I'm gonna
try, but it's hard.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.863
I keep thinking about
this girl, Nancy...

22:45.864 --> 22:46.280
Oh God.

22:46.281 --> 22:51.118
That my daughter hangs out with.
God, I want her ass so bad.

22:51.119 --> 22:52.703
Christ, can you just-

22:52.704 --> 22:55.915
How are we gonna deal
with these things on my head?

22:55.916 --> 23:00.419
You fucking patients, all you
care about is yourselves.

23:00.420 --> 23:05.674
Listen, Doctor, just saw
the goddamn horns off.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.393
You sure this is
gonna work, right?

23:15.394 --> 23:19.814
Not at all, actually,
but it'll be fun to try.

23:19.815 --> 23:20.272
What?

23:20.273 --> 23:21.982
Now just breathe normally.

23:21.983 --> 23:22.942
What? No. Okay.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.945
Doctor, please, if you're not
sure about we can just...

23:25.946 --> 23:31.200
It'll be okay. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

23:31.201 --> 23:34.620
Everything's gonna be fine.

23:34.996 --> 23:37.164
That's right.

23:59.187 --> 24:01.439
Have you seen
that girl before?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.315
What's she doing?

24:03.775 --> 24:04.775
I think it's Morse code.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.153
And she's telling you to stop
checking her legs out in

24:07.154 --> 24:10.698
church or she's gonna
give you a black eye.

24:12.951 --> 24:16.203
Go forth in peace.

24:41.396 --> 24:44.064
Eat my guts, Glenna!

24:56.912 --> 24:57.953
Here we go.

24:57.954 --> 24:59.747
Here we go.
Run, run, run!

25:03.668 --> 25:05.044
Sorry, Scruffy.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.050
Oh. Oh, yeah.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.801
You sick Fuck.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.140
Yeah, spread it's legs.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.934
Yeah, put them
in one by one, guys.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.102
I'm telling you, she
was doing Morse code.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.103
She was sending me a message.

25:23.104 --> 25:25.397
Yeah, I didn't even
think you liked girls, Ig.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.066
Always thought
you were a fag.

25:27.067 --> 25:27.900
Shut up, Meatbag.

25:27.901 --> 25:28.984
What's
so special about her?

25:28.985 --> 25:32.613
I mean, it's like y'all
never saw a girl before?

25:35.867 --> 25:38.035
You guys are gonna
wanna find cover or else you'll

25:38.036 --> 25:40.329
all be wearing turkey dinner.

25:41.998 --> 25:44.208
Hey, get the fuck out.

25:45.085 --> 25:47.169
What's wrong? What?

25:47.420 --> 25:49.129
Shit.
Maybe it got wet.

25:49.130 --> 25:52.633
Give me the lighter. Sometimes
it messes up and stuff.

25:58.515 --> 26:01.016
Now you're literally Meatbag.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.435
- Oh, man.
- Oh, shit.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.019
Never looked better.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.104
So what are we
gonna blow up now?

26:05.105 --> 26:06.981
We're not blowing
up anything else today.

26:06.982 --> 26:10.109
I'm saving my last cherry
for something special.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.402
Come on, Eric. Don't be a dick.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.445
The only way I'm giving
up this last cherry bomb...

26:13.446 --> 26:16.615
is if one of you homos
climbs in that shopping cart...

26:16.616 --> 26:19.952
and rides it
down the log ramp.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.122
I'll do it, Meatbag.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.082
Naked.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.297
I'm gonna do it, Eric.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.091
Sure you are.

26:34.884 --> 26:38.137
Igs, don't. Don't!

26:51.860 --> 26:55.279
Don't be ridiculous.
You don't have to do this.

26:59.993 --> 27:03.454
You'll get a cherry.
Come on, man.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.539
One left.

27:08.001 --> 27:11.253
Don't do this, please.
You're gonna kill yourself.

27:11.254 --> 27:15.215
Dude, if you get hurt,
Mom's gonna fucking kill me.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.183
No. No, I can't watch.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.441
Oh, shit!

27:38.114 --> 27:40.074
Ig! Ig! Ig! Ig!

27:40.075 --> 27:43.160
Oh, my god, he's
hit his head on a log.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.508
Do something.
Do something!

28:29.040 --> 28:30.457
Where are they?

28:30.458 --> 28:32.376
They should be up by now.

28:32.377 --> 28:36.130
Oh my...

28:36.464 --> 28:38.298
Oh, my god!

28:40.135 --> 28:42.928
- Iggy!
- Ig! Ig!

28:43.763 --> 28:44.179
Ig.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.515
Hey, Terry, your brother
here's a total fucking lunatic.

28:46.516 --> 28:49.643
You fucking idiot! If Lee hadn't
been here to pull you out...

28:49.644 --> 28:52.020
Did you do
mouth-to-mouth, faggot?

28:52.021 --> 28:54.356
Shut up.
Now give me the cherry.

28:54.357 --> 28:56.024
No way. I said ride down naked.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.901
You wore tighty
whities and sneakers.

28:57.902 --> 28:58.902
Eric!

28:58.903 --> 29:01.697
Give him the fucking cherry.

29:11.875 --> 29:15.586
So, you like that
new girl in church?

29:15.712 --> 29:17.629
I don't know her yet.

29:17.797 --> 29:18.630
I like her too.

29:18.631 --> 29:21.675
She's not like all the
other girls around here.

29:21.676 --> 29:22.885
I mean, she's
not like Glenna.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.344
She gives handjobs to
your brother and Eric...

29:24.345 --> 29:26.805
because she thinks that's the
only way guys will like her.

29:26.806 --> 29:30.225
But they just
think she's trash.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.811
Maybe I should
give her the cross.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.188
I mean, I am the
one who fixed it.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.982
No! You can't do that.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.444
Okay. What will
you give me for it?

29:46.034 --> 29:48.160
Do you want my cherry bomb?

30:23.363 --> 30:26.365
You
fixed my cross.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.242
Yeah.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.881
Did something, you
know, happen to your mom?

30:43.341 --> 30:44.675
She died last year.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.468
That's why my dad
and I moved here.

30:46.469 --> 30:48.178
Really?
How did she...

30:48.179 --> 30:48.887
She had cancer.

30:48.888 --> 30:52.349
Is it okay if we don't
talk about it anymore?

30:52.350 --> 30:54.852
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.647
Thanks again for
fixing my cross.

31:01.025 --> 31:01.859
Ig!

31:01.860 --> 31:03.986
Did you give the
cherry bomb to Lee?

31:03.987 --> 31:04.695
What happened?

31:04.696 --> 31:06.488
It blew up in his hand!

31:06.489 --> 31:06.947
What?

31:06.948 --> 31:08.365
Let's get him in exam room

31:08.366 --> 31:10.742
number two.
Let's operate right away.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.080
Where is he?

31:15.081 --> 31:16.623
He's in that room.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.253
Hey, look on the bright side.

31:21.254 --> 31:23.463
I still got eight fingers.

31:23.464 --> 31:25.507
I'm sorry.
I wish I never gave you the...

31:25.508 --> 31:26.717
You're not going to tell your

31:26.718 --> 31:27.759
mom who gave you the
cherry bomb, right?

31:27.760 --> 31:31.430
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

31:32.932 --> 31:36.476
I'm glad one good
thing happened today.

31:47.363 --> 31:48.447
Where are you taking me?

31:48.448 --> 31:51.825
Come on.
Can't wait to show you this.

31:51.826 --> 31:52.326
Wow.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.745
Come on, come on, come on.

31:56.748 --> 31:57.497
Don't fall off.

31:57.498 --> 31:59.458
- Okay.
- Come on, come on!

31:59.459 --> 32:01.209
Don't trip on any roots, okay?

32:01.210 --> 32:03.921
Are you sure you
know where you're going?

32:07.967 --> 32:09.426
You see?

32:09.427 --> 32:11.094
Wow.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.305
How did you find this place?

32:13.306 --> 32:16.350
Just walking through
the woods one day.

32:18.561 --> 32:19.603
Come on.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.272
This is where I come
when I want to be alone.

32:22.273 --> 32:25.359
So now I know
where to find you.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.247
We've got a great hiding
spot where you can hide food...

32:39.248 --> 32:43.210
blankets, anything
else you want to hide.

32:53.054 --> 32:55.514
So you're a Bowie fan too.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.432
Yeah.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.652
I didn't tell you the truth.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.199
Lee's the one who
fixed your cross.

33:15.493 --> 33:18.161
He wanted to give
it back to you, but...

33:18.162 --> 33:21.039
I traded him the
cherry bomb instead.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.041
So it's all my fault.

33:23.042 --> 33:25.085
How is it your fault?

33:25.086 --> 33:26.545
Because if he
gave it back to you,

33:26.546 --> 33:27.504
then he would've
been the one who...

33:27.505 --> 33:30.215
You think you traded
me for the cherry bomb?

33:30.216 --> 33:33.760
You think that's
how things work?

33:39.350 --> 33:41.852
I left it there for you.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.563
It wasn't an accident.

33:47.483 --> 33:51.611
I wanted you to find
it and give it back to me.

33:51.654 --> 33:55.449
I wanted you to
be the one who...

33:55.616 --> 33:57.534
Who what?

35:32.547 --> 35:34.339
What?

35:34.841 --> 35:36.508
What?

35:39.137 --> 35:41.096
Aw, fuck!

35:45.101 --> 35:47.894
What the hell is going on here?

35:49.522 --> 35:49.938
Hey!

35:49.939 --> 35:54.693
I was gonna operate, but
I sorta got distracted.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.820
We asked you if we
could have sex instead

35:56.821 --> 35:58.238
and you said it was okay.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.615
How could I possibly
say it was okay?

36:00.616 --> 36:01.199
I was under anesthesia.

36:01.200 --> 36:05.829
You sort of nodded your head.
We thought it was okay.

36:20.928 --> 36:22.971
Father Mould?

36:25.850 --> 36:28.393
Get away from me.
Get away.

36:28.394 --> 36:28.977
Please, leave me alone!

36:28.978 --> 36:30.854
No, no, no, no. I'm not here to
hurt you. Please.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.023
Tell me what I have
to do to stop this.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.191
How do I make them go away?

36:34.192 --> 36:36.610
You killed that
innocent girl Merrin.

36:36.611 --> 36:37.569
There's nothing I can do.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.529
No, I No, except
I didn't kill her!

36:39.530 --> 36:40.113
Please, leave me alone!

36:40.114 --> 36:41.323
I didn't kill her,
Father, and now people

36:41.324 --> 36:43.533
are telling me all these
things I don't want to hear.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.203
I mean, there must be
a prayer you can say.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.329
I'll try anything.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.663
You did this to yourself.

36:48.664 --> 36:49.080
What?

36:49.081 --> 36:50.498
You turned away from God.

36:50.499 --> 36:52.500
You cast yourself
into the darkness.

36:52.501 --> 36:54.169
But I didn't do anything wrong.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.420
Every devil used to be an angel.

36:55.421 --> 36:58.006
And now you've fallen
from grace forever.

36:58.007 --> 36:59.841
When Satan was
banished from Heaven...

36:59.842 --> 37:03.678
he was cursed to crawl
the earth like a snake.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.223
There's no hope for you.

37:06.224 --> 37:10.685
What? So that's it? There's
nothing you can do for me?

37:10.686 --> 37:13.271
I've got a rope in
that shed over there.

37:13.272 --> 37:18.485
I could take you out to that
tree where Merrin died and I...

37:19.779 --> 37:22.280
I could string you up.

37:22.615 --> 37:26.993
Unless you'd like to do the
decent thing and hang yourself.

37:27.578 --> 37:30.205
What do you say?

37:42.468 --> 37:43.802
Lee.

37:43.803 --> 37:44.219
Hey.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.012
Everyone in this town
is going fucking crazy.

37:46.013 --> 37:47.764
Yeah, the town's
always been crazy.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.642
No, but I think it's because
of me and these goddamn horns.

37:50.643 --> 37:52.644
Yeah.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.771
Wait, what?

37:54.772 --> 37:56.523
The horns.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.566
These horns.

37:58.818 --> 38:01.820
What are you talking about?

38:02.196 --> 38:03.780
Wait, can't you see them?

38:03.781 --> 38:06.533
Are you high right now?

38:06.993 --> 38:09.995
You been hanging out with Terry?

38:09.996 --> 38:11.538
So maybe...

38:11.539 --> 38:14.749
maybe the horns just
don't work on good people.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.711
Yeah, I think you've been
under an inhuman amount

38:17.712 --> 38:20.755
of stress recently.
And maybe you're just starting

38:20.756 --> 38:24.884
to go a little, you know-
A little, oh, cuckoo.

38:24.885 --> 38:28.847
But if I am this crazy and
I can imagine all this...

38:28.848 --> 38:31.850
then I could easily have got so
drunk that I blacked out that

38:31.851 --> 38:36.896
night and killed Merrin and
just forgot all about it, right?

38:54.165 --> 38:55.832
Mom?

39:01.130 --> 39:02.672
Mom?

39:04.759 --> 39:07.844
Well, I didn't know
you were coming.

39:07.845 --> 39:10.347
I didn't know where
else to go, Mom.

39:10.348 --> 39:14.184
Something really bad
is happening to me.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.649
Oh, sweetheart.

39:22.276 --> 39:25.779
Why couldn't you
go somewhere else?

39:26.238 --> 39:27.781
What?

39:27.782 --> 39:28.948
What do you mean?

39:28.949 --> 39:32.077
I don't want to hear
about all your problems.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.120
I don't want to know.

39:34.121 --> 39:34.537
Mom.

39:34.538 --> 39:38.750
Sometimes when you talk,
I just want to sing.

39:38.751 --> 39:41.086
La, la, la, la, la, la!

39:41.087 --> 39:42.045
What are you doing? Mom!

39:42.046 --> 39:46.424
I wanna hold my breath
until you just go away!

39:48.344 --> 39:51.554
Ar-Jesus Christ,
Mom, don't Don't!

39:51.555 --> 39:53.139
Stop it!

39:55.976 --> 39:59.396
I want to write you a letter,
a really nice letter...

39:59.397 --> 40:01.564
about how much Dad
and I love you...

40:01.565 --> 40:06.861
and how great it would be for
both of us if you would just go.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.155
But where?
Where can I go?

40:09.156 --> 40:12.992
I don't know. Didn't you always
want to go hiking in Alaska?

40:12.993 --> 40:15.995
Didn't you want to go to
Vietnam to teach English?

40:15.996 --> 40:17.247
Those were things
Merrin and I were

40:17.248 --> 40:18.081
gonna do together.
You know that.

40:18.082 --> 40:21.000
I don't care where you go. Just
as long as I don't have to see

40:21.001 --> 40:26.714
you. Because every time I see
you, it just makes me so...

40:27.091 --> 40:29.008
unhappy.

40:29.468 --> 40:33.012
I just want to be happy
again, sweetheart.

40:33.013 --> 40:35.557
No, I understand.

40:42.940 --> 40:46.609
And I don't want you
to be my son anymore.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.196
Oh.

40:52.074 --> 40:54.784
Are you gonna go away?

41:01.250 --> 41:02.709
Ig.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.211
I thought I heard you come in.

41:06.672 --> 41:09.466
Yeah, okay, let me walk
you through this, Dad.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.843
This is the part where you
tell me something awful...

41:11.844 --> 41:13.470
you've been keeping to yourself.

41:13.471 --> 41:17.974
Just say it, we'll
get it out of the way.

41:19.185 --> 41:22.520
I don't know why you
turned out like this.

41:24.815 --> 41:28.318
With your brother, it's easier.

41:30.696 --> 41:33.990
We could always
play music together.

41:33.991 --> 41:37.035
But with you, I never
know what to say to you.

41:37.036 --> 41:42.624
Well, that's not bad,
all things considered.

41:43.125 --> 41:45.335
I think about Merrin.

41:47.546 --> 41:50.256
What a beautiful girl she was.

41:57.473 --> 41:59.098
I loved her.

41:59.517 --> 42:02.227
You know, in a way.

42:04.939 --> 42:07.148
I envied you.

42:08.067 --> 42:09.901
I was never in
love with anyone

42:09.902 --> 42:12.111
the way you two were in
love with each other.

42:12.112 --> 42:15.448
You couldn't hear her
laugh without smiling.

42:15.866 --> 42:18.117
It was like music.

42:18.994 --> 42:22.747
And when I think about
what you did to her...

42:23.958 --> 42:26.626
And you never thought maybe...

42:26.627 --> 42:29.879
just maybe that I didn't do it?

42:29.880 --> 42:30.964
Of course not.

42:30.965 --> 42:33.675
You're trying to get
away with murder.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.553
And the worst part is,
I'm helping you do it.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.681
What? What do
you mean by that?

42:39.682 --> 42:41.474
I went to college
with the guy that runs

42:41.475 --> 42:42.016
the state forensics lab.

42:42.017 --> 42:44.352
Dad, are you telling me
that you got your friend to

42:44.353 --> 42:45.270
set that fire at the lab?

42:45.271 --> 42:47.730
When the world comes for my
son with the knives out...

42:47.731 --> 42:50.358
it's my job to stand in the way.
And if you went to jail...

42:50.359 --> 42:53.319
Dad, the evidence you got
burned up could have saved me.

42:53.320 --> 42:55.738
How could you do it?

42:56.115 --> 42:59.033
She was one of the best
people I ever knew!

42:59.034 --> 43:03.288
She was my favorite
thing about you.

43:04.873 --> 43:06.791
Yeah, me, too.

43:07.334 --> 43:09.127
So if you knew how
much I loved her

43:09.128 --> 43:12.171
then how could you ever
believe I'd killed her?

43:16.552 --> 43:19.178
Isn't that why you killed her?

43:19.346 --> 43:23.224
Because you loved her so much...

43:24.101 --> 43:26.769
and you lost her.

43:28.355 --> 43:32.108
Way more people kill out
of love than out of hate.

43:36.947 --> 43:39.490
What's going on, Ig?
You go home like I asked you to?

43:39.491 --> 43:42.201
Yeah, I did that and it
was very enlightening. Did you

43:42.202 --> 43:45.163
know that my dad got his friend
to start the fire in the lab?

43:45.164 --> 43:47.415
Hypothetically,
if I did know,

43:47.416 --> 43:49.917
I would legally be required
to tell the police.

43:49.918 --> 43:54.172
But maybe, the fire was a
blessing in disguise.

43:54.173 --> 43:56.924
How? How is it a fucking
blessing? If the lab hadn't

43:56.925 --> 43:59.135
burned down, that evidence
would have cleared me, Lee.

43:59.136 --> 44:01.554
Okay, okay, I know. It's rough
for you staying at your house

44:01.555 --> 44:03.765
right now. Why don't you just
take the keys to my place.

44:03.766 --> 44:04.432
You can crash on the couch.

44:04.433 --> 44:07.310
No, you know what? I'm fine.
I've actually got a lot to do.

44:07.311 --> 44:09.729
I've gotta figure out
who really killed Merrin

44:09.730 --> 44:10.730
and get him to confess.

44:10.731 --> 44:12.023
How you
planning to do that?

44:12.024 --> 44:16.027
Lately, I can be pretty
fucking persuasive.

44:26.914 --> 44:30.667
Hey, Ig, nice look for you.
Showing your true nature?

44:30.668 --> 44:32.418
You know, I'd
appreciate it if you guys

44:32.419 --> 44:33.211
would all just fuck off.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.170
Come on,
Ig, admit you killed her.

44:34.171 --> 44:35.421
It'd be such a
huge scoop for me.

44:35.422 --> 44:37.382
Oh, good to know your
journalistic integrity is

44:37.383 --> 44:38.174
fucking unimpeachable.

44:38.175 --> 44:40.802
Hey, you confess to me, I can
get out of stupid local news.

44:40.803 --> 44:41.803
You know what, I got an idea.

44:41.804 --> 44:45.098
How about you guys beat the
shit out of each other...

44:45.099 --> 44:48.810
and the winner gets an
exclusive interview with me.

45:28.934 --> 45:31.686
Thought I told
you I don't want you coming

45:31.687 --> 45:34.188
around here no more, Ig.

45:36.150 --> 45:38.818
Jesus Christ!
Al, you don't want to do that.

45:38.819 --> 45:39.318
You'll get arrested.

45:39.319 --> 45:41.112
I don't give a flying
fuck if I get arrested.

45:41.113 --> 45:42.196
But why don't you
get me a whiskey?

45:42.197 --> 45:43.906
You know you want the money.

45:43.907 --> 45:45.450
What I really want...

45:45.451 --> 45:48.369
is to burn this place down
and collect the insurance.

45:48.370 --> 45:50.705
Well, can you not burn
down the bar right now?

45:50.706 --> 45:52.749
I need your help with something.

45:52.750 --> 45:55.585
If anyone knows anything
about who killed Merrin...

45:55.586 --> 45:58.379
you're gonna have
to tell me now.

46:05.387 --> 46:09.307
The only thing I ever
killed was a couple of dogs.

46:09.308 --> 46:13.311
I run a dog fighting ring
out of a supply room back there.

46:13.312 --> 46:14.353
Jesus, Al, I don't
want to know that.

46:14.354 --> 46:17.106
I've been unemployed for
three months and I hate my life

46:17.107 --> 46:21.194
so yeah, I can sure understand
wanting to kill someone.

46:21.195 --> 46:23.154
No, Rob, that's
not what I meant. Oh.

46:23.155 --> 46:27.074
I really want
to show everybody my dick.

46:27.075 --> 46:29.202
Oh! Don't.

46:29.787 --> 46:32.038
I want that all the time.

46:33.665 --> 46:36.083
I want that all the time.

46:36.084 --> 46:40.129
The only thing I know
is I got a cousin who's a cop.

46:40.130 --> 46:42.340
He knows who the new witness is.

46:42.341 --> 46:45.760
It's a waitress who served you
the night Merrin got killed.

46:45.761 --> 46:48.221
Said she saw you drive
back to the restaurant and

46:48.222 --> 46:50.181
drag Merrin into your car.

46:50.182 --> 46:52.183
Thanks a lot, Stan.

47:15.958 --> 47:18.084
Hey, my interview!

47:18.794 --> 47:22.421
Hey, my interview!

47:47.489 --> 47:49.282
Okay.

47:49.449 --> 47:50.783
Okay, guys, so...

47:50.784 --> 47:53.703
you're gonna come tomorrow night
to the diner at about 9:00.

47:53.704 --> 47:55.413
I will have hopefully
done the deed by then...

47:55.414 --> 47:56.998
and then we can go
out and celebrate.

47:56.999 --> 47:59.876
Fuck yeah. You
want me to bring any goodies?

47:59.877 --> 48:00.293
Ehm...

48:00.294 --> 48:02.587
No, I think me and Merrin
are gonna be happy enough

48:02.588 --> 48:04.380
tomorrow night without
stimulants, I hope.

48:04.381 --> 48:08.384
Yeah, well, I'm a musician and
we always need stimulants.

48:08.385 --> 48:08.843
I understand that.

48:08.844 --> 48:12.638
And I am a state employee
subject to random drug testing.

48:12.639 --> 48:14.265
Sure you're not
rushing into this?

48:14.266 --> 48:16.142
Rushing into it?
Dude, how am I rushing into it?

48:16.143 --> 48:19.312
We've been going out
since we were kids.

48:37.623 --> 48:39.999
Hi.
- Hey.

48:48.300 --> 48:49.926
Hey.

48:51.136 --> 48:54.639
Oh, what's-
is everything all right?

48:57.142 --> 49:00.019
Hey, what's wrong, Merrin?

49:03.398 --> 49:05.441
I don't really know
how to say this.

49:05.442 --> 49:08.444
I'm just gonna go
ahead and say it.

49:10.447 --> 49:13.074
I'm moving to Los Angeles.

49:14.576 --> 49:16.452
Are you kidding?
That's great.

49:16.453 --> 49:18.037
Like, I can get a
leave of absence from the

49:18.038 --> 49:21.123
radio station easy.
I want a change of scene too.

49:21.124 --> 49:23.668
It's not what I'm talking about.

49:24.169 --> 49:27.338
I think that we need to
stop seeing each other.

49:27.339 --> 49:30.925
Hey, lovebirds...
you guys ready to order?

49:30.926 --> 49:33.594
Oh, I don't think we've
quite decided yet.

49:33.595 --> 49:36.597
Okay. Well, I'll come back.

49:37.474 --> 49:38.641
I don't understand.

49:38.642 --> 49:41.477
I thought everything
was going great.

49:41.478 --> 49:44.563
Well, it's just that we haven't
had a chance to ever be apart.

49:44.564 --> 49:46.899
And I've never had the
chance to think about

49:46.900 --> 49:48.234
what I want for my life.

49:48.235 --> 49:51.487
Well, okay, but I know
what I want. I want the

49:51.488 --> 49:54.490
life we've been dreaming
about since we were kids.

49:54.491 --> 49:55.574
But that's the problem.

49:55.575 --> 49:57.618
We've been dreaming about
that since we were kids.

49:57.619 --> 50:01.747
And we're adults now. We
need to start being practical.

50:02.416 --> 50:04.709
I don't know what
you mean by that.

50:04.710 --> 50:06.544
I don't want to
ever be the reason for

50:06.545 --> 50:07.878
any of your regrets, Ig.

50:07.879 --> 50:10.423
But how many times have we
talked about getting married?

50:10.424 --> 50:12.800
I mean, how many times
have we talked about

50:12.801 --> 50:14.176
what we're going
to name our kids?

50:14.177 --> 50:15.594
I'm not even sure if
I want to have kids!

50:15.595 --> 50:17.596
What! Well, you
sounded pretty into it the

50:17.597 --> 50:20.891
last 8,000 times
we talked about it!

50:23.520 --> 50:26.605
How many girls
have you been with?

50:27.524 --> 50:29.984
You know the answer to that.

50:30.569 --> 50:32.486
Just me.

50:32.487 --> 50:33.446
Yeah.

50:33.447 --> 50:35.448
No one does that, Ig.

50:35.449 --> 50:38.868
No one on the whole
planet does that.

50:39.494 --> 50:41.871
You need to see other
people so you can figure out

50:41.872 --> 50:43.914
if I am the one that
you want to be with.

50:43.915 --> 50:46.083
But I don't want to
see other people.

50:47.294 --> 50:50.129
Is that what you want?

50:55.135 --> 50:57.720
Are you in love
with somebody else?

51:03.393 --> 51:05.686
And how far has it gone?

51:08.356 --> 51:10.816
Answer me!
How far has it gone?

51:10.817 --> 51:12.693
Have you fucked him already?

51:12.694 --> 51:13.277
Please, Ig.

51:13.278 --> 51:15.863
No! Tell me! Tell me
everything that happened.

51:15.864 --> 51:18.699
I need to know.
Have you fucked him already?

51:18.700 --> 51:19.825
Why are you asking me this?

51:19.826 --> 51:21.827
Because I want to know!
I want to know everything.

51:21.828 --> 51:25.664
It's gonna make it easier
for me to hate you!

51:31.505 --> 51:33.964
You deserve better.

51:34.466 --> 51:37.301
Finally, something we agree on.

51:47.187 --> 51:50.564
Please, I'm gonna be lost.

51:52.359 --> 51:55.444
I'm not in love
with you anymore.

52:00.742 --> 52:04.870
Come on, please. We're not
done talking about this.

52:05.038 --> 52:07.498
Please, Ig.

52:09.167 --> 52:10.793
Please.

52:17.259 --> 52:19.301
Yeah, what?
What are you looking at?

52:19.302 --> 52:19.844
Sir, sir, sir.

52:19.845 --> 52:21.095
We're gonna have to ask
you and your wife to leave.

52:21.096 --> 52:23.722
Yeah? She's not my wife. She's
just someone I used to fuck.

52:23.723 --> 52:24.723
Hey, easy.

52:29.563 --> 52:31.230
Come on.

52:33.483 --> 52:35.818
Hey, Ig, whoa. How'd it go?
You already proposed?

52:35.819 --> 52:37.069
The party's over, Terry.
Go home.

52:37.070 --> 52:39.822
What the hell are you talking
about? Hey, hey! I thought

52:39.823 --> 52:42.992
we were gonna celebrate
tonight. What's going on?

52:43.827 --> 52:47.413
Iggy, what the
fuck are you doing? Hey!

53:01.761 --> 53:04.305
Merrin, you all right?

53:33.710 --> 53:34.585
Good morning, Ig.

53:34.586 --> 53:37.713
Can you roll down the
window so we can talk?

53:40.800 --> 53:43.385
Hey, Meatbag, what's up?

53:43.386 --> 53:46.263
When's the last time
you saw Merrin, Ig?

53:46.264 --> 53:47.598
What's happened to her, Eric?

53:47.599 --> 53:51.810
What makes you think
something happened to her?

53:53.438 --> 53:55.314
Oh, fuck.
It's all my fault.

53:55.315 --> 53:59.610
Anything that happened to her,
it's all my fucking fault.

54:10.747 --> 54:15.209
So, do you guys want
dessert? Can I get you dessert?

54:16.378 --> 54:18.671
I got a cherry pie.

54:22.217 --> 54:24.551
Oh, I gotta go.

54:25.553 --> 54:27.638
You could sit wherever you want.

54:27.639 --> 54:31.558
Oh, wait, you're that guy.
Ig Perrish.

54:31.559 --> 54:31.976
Yeah.

54:31.977 --> 54:35.187
I've heard you've been telling
lies about me to the police.

54:35.188 --> 54:35.980
Yeah, I have.

54:35.981 --> 54:39.108
And you know, I don't even feel
a little bit bad about it.

54:39.109 --> 54:42.778
You want to tell me exactly
what you said to them?

54:42.779 --> 54:44.947
Well, I told them that you're
girlfriend forgot her jacket

54:44.948 --> 54:47.116
so I followed her into
the parking lot and I saw you

54:47.117 --> 54:50.536
drive back and scream that
you were gonna kill her.

54:50.537 --> 54:51.829
But you know that's not true.

54:51.830 --> 54:54.331
And that I saw you drag
her into your car...

54:54.332 --> 54:55.666
and then you drove off.

54:55.667 --> 54:58.460
What? Why the hell
would you say all that?

54:58.461 --> 55:02.131
Because I want to be in
all the newspapers and on TV.

55:02.132 --> 55:04.883
I wanna be the star
witness at your trial.

55:04.884 --> 55:06.677
I'm pretty enough
to be on TV right?

55:06.678 --> 55:09.471
Especially if I get my tits
lifted the way that I want.

55:09.472 --> 55:11.390
You're just a
fucking crazy liar!

55:11.391 --> 55:14.977
I know I am.
I'm so bad. I'm bad.

55:14.978 --> 55:17.688
Sometimes when people
ask me what you did...

55:17.689 --> 55:19.523
I say that after you
beat her brains in...

55:19.524 --> 55:24.236
that then you turned her over
and you fucked her in the ass.

55:24.904 --> 55:28.115
You should see their
faces when I say that.

55:28.116 --> 55:29.950
Everybody loves a
good sex murder.

55:29.951 --> 55:32.578
You're insane. And my
brother was here that night

55:32.579 --> 55:34.204
and he saw me leave alone.

55:34.205 --> 55:36.457
I'm gonna release
my own sex tape.

55:36.458 --> 55:37.958
And I'm gonna get
a reality show.

55:37.959 --> 55:41.337
I'm gonna be in US
magazine, smiling.

56:25.965 --> 56:26.799
Ig!

56:26.800 --> 56:28.133
Oh, Hey, Glenna.

56:28.134 --> 56:29.593
How's it going?

56:29.594 --> 56:31.512
How do you think it's going?

56:31.513 --> 56:33.597
Because it's going
worse than that.

56:33.598 --> 56:35.557
You all right?

56:35.558 --> 56:36.392
Whoa. Excuse me.

56:36.393 --> 56:39.853
I think I had something
bad this morning.

56:40.814 --> 56:43.440
Yeah, you did.
I was there.

56:43.441 --> 56:45.484
What? You mean last night?

56:45.485 --> 56:46.652
No, this morning.

56:46.653 --> 56:49.655
You don't remember any of that?

56:49.656 --> 56:50.072
Wow.

56:50.073 --> 56:53.867
No, I must have been
really drunk still.

57:03.378 --> 57:06.713
Why don't you let me suck
your cock in the men's room?

57:06.714 --> 57:08.799
I would really like that.

57:08.800 --> 57:11.927
And I bet it would
make you feel better.

57:11.928 --> 57:13.846
No, Glenna.

57:13.847 --> 57:16.515
Thanks, but not right now.

57:17.183 --> 57:19.643
The thing is, Ig...

57:20.770 --> 57:23.981
I've always been
in love with you.

57:25.900 --> 57:28.193
Since we were kids.

57:28.820 --> 57:31.488
But I guess you
knew that, right?

57:31.573 --> 57:33.866
I guess I did kinda know that.

57:33.867 --> 57:35.159
Yeah.

57:35.160 --> 57:40.956
God, it's just I just wish
that I could leave this town.

57:41.749 --> 57:42.958
And just...

57:42.959 --> 57:44.585
What's stopping you?

57:44.586 --> 57:45.335
You.

57:45.336 --> 57:48.797
Me? No.
It can't be me.

57:48.798 --> 57:53.844
Right? No. Put this shithole
town in your rear view mirror

57:53.845 --> 57:57.723
and do something
good for yourself.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.939
Hey, go.

58:32.926 --> 58:35.219
Ig, I didn't
know you were here.

58:35.220 --> 58:38.764
Jesus Christ, what the
fuck is on your head?

58:38.765 --> 58:39.932
They're horns, crazy story.

58:39.933 --> 58:41.975
Listen, Terry...
I need you to help me.

58:41.976 --> 58:43.644
No, fucking just
listen to me, Terry.

58:43.645 --> 58:45.979
The waitress from the diner,
okay, she is going to the

58:45.980 --> 58:48.357
cops and telling them that
she saw me drag Merrin into

58:48.358 --> 58:50.484
my car and drive away from
the diner that night.

58:50.485 --> 58:52.277
Jesus, I know for a
fact that's not true.

58:52.278 --> 58:53.737
Well, yeah, you know
that, and I know that

58:53.738 --> 58:55.072
but how the hell are
we gonna prove that?

58:55.073 --> 58:58.367
I mean, Merrin left the
diner with me that night.

58:59.953 --> 59:02.996
What do you mean, she
left the diner with you?

59:02.997 --> 59:05.207
You told me you never saw
her that night at all.

59:05.208 --> 59:08.627
I didn't kill her, Ig.
I would never hurt her. I...

59:08.628 --> 59:10.045
What are you
talking about, Terry?

59:10.046 --> 59:11.505
I was just too scared.

59:12.674 --> 59:13.840
Fuck!

59:15.843 --> 59:17.302
Tell me, Terry!

59:17.303 --> 59:18.512
Okay!

59:38.408 --> 59:43.412
So, what just happened
with you and Ig?

59:44.038 --> 59:46.873
I don't want to talk about it.

59:46.874 --> 59:49.042
Are you sure?
I mean, you're shaking.

59:49.043 --> 59:51.420
Look at you.
You're a mess.

59:53.006 --> 59:55.007
Hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you take one of these.

59:55.008 --> 59:58.093
Just take one.
They're fun. Take the edge off.

59:58.094 --> 01:00:00.429
I don't want to.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:04.391
I need to release what
I'm feeling tonight.

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:14.151
God, you're beautiful.

01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:16.945
You know that?

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.280
Can you pull over?

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:20.073
I need to get out of the car.

01:00:20.074 --> 01:00:21.074
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I didn't...

01:00:21.075 --> 01:00:23.910
Look, it's the end of the
world out there. Why don't...

01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:24.453
I wanna go for a walk.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:27.998
Merrin, Are you trying to
get yourself killed? Hang on.

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:34.421
Thanks for the ride, Terry.

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:35.172
Come back!

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:38.717
I'm fine now, I promise, okay?

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:41.178
Merrin!

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:45.349
Don't be ridiculous.
Where are you going?

01:00:54.108 --> 01:00:56.652
I'll wait for you!

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:45.200
What the fuck?

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.786
What the fuck?

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.090
Merrin.

01:02:07.181 --> 01:02:08.181
Merrin!

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:12.310
Merrin!

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.156
Merrin!

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:13.497
You fuck!
How could you?

01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:14.247
What did you do to her?

01:03:14.248 --> 01:03:16.833
Do you even fucking remember
what you did to her?

01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:19.294
I didn't kill her.
I loved Merrin too.

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:21.922
Well, if you didn't
kill her, then who did?

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:24.674
Oh, fuck!

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:27.886
We got a call on
the radio about some kind

01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:29.471
of altercation
going on out here.

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:32.182
We got a pretty good
idea who's responsible.

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:34.184
Listen to me, Eric,
this is all my fault.

01:03:34.185 --> 01:03:36.937
Hey, maestro,
break time is over. Let's go.

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:40.065
Go on back inside, Terry, none
of this thing concerns you.

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:42.734
Yeah, go back inside.
Play a fucking song!

01:03:42.735 --> 01:03:44.486
You'd better calm down,
Ig. You don't want to be

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.613
resisting arrest. We'd be
inclined to use force.

01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:48.031
What are you arresting
me for? 'Cause I got into

01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:49.825
a fight with my coward
brother? Is that a crime?

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:53.245
The thing is, this club is
across the county line.

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:56.081
Which means we caught you
fleeing jurisdiction.

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:58.375
For God's sake, talk about
the most obvious kind

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:01.211
of trumped up charge. Fuck!

01:04:01.295 --> 01:04:02.879
Go back inside.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.005
Fuck you, Eric.

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:06.424
Fuck me? You fuck!

01:04:06.425 --> 01:04:08.885
I wish we could bring
you in for worse.

01:04:08.886 --> 01:04:12.138
I wish I could plant
something on you.

01:04:12.306 --> 01:04:14.266
Like maybe a piece of her dress.

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:15.517
That way I could put
you away for good.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:18.311
For God's sake, Eric,
you've known me my whole life.

01:04:18.312 --> 01:04:20.438
You know I'd never hurt her.

01:04:20.439 --> 01:04:24.442
Bullshit, Ig! You confessed
to me. Everyone in town

01:04:24.443 --> 01:04:26.486
saw you fighting with her
the night she was killed!

01:04:26.487 --> 01:04:28.280
That's not what happened.
I said whatever happened to

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:31.366
her was my fault because I ran
off on her. I left her alone.

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:34.578
Whatever that waitress
told you is lies.

01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:37.122
Hey, listen, you asshole.
I'm gonna make sure

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.999
you get punished for
everything you did to her

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.168
even if I have to beat you
to death with my own hands.

01:04:42.169 --> 01:04:43.920
Do it, Eric.
Beat him to death.

01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:46.256
That'll give me something
to whack off to tonight.

01:04:46.257 --> 01:04:50.260
Only I'll be picturing
both of you naked.

01:04:50.636 --> 01:04:51.720
Yeah, I like that.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:55.348
I like to think about
you naked too, Sturtz.

01:04:57.476 --> 01:04:59.477
What the fuck?

01:05:11.782 --> 01:05:14.659
You know, Lee might
have sprung you for now, but

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.161
we're not gonna let
you out of our sight.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:17.704
Hey, Meatbag,
leave my client alone.

01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:19.956
You're trying to make my life
as hard on me as possible?

01:05:19.957 --> 01:05:21.541
Hey, Lee, I know who
the new witness is. It's the

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:23.543
waitress from the diner.
She's lying about everything.

01:05:23.544 --> 01:05:25.503
Whoa, whoa, what is this now?
Do I gotta keep a leash on you?

01:05:25.504 --> 01:05:27.380
Yeah, and Terry drove away
from the diner with Merrin

01:05:27.381 --> 01:05:29.758
that night. They drove
off together in his car.

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:32.260
You're saying that Terry was the
last person to see her alive?

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:34.304
Yeah. I don't think he ever
would have done anything

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:35.639
to her but he can't
remember anything from the...

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.557
Why is he confessing this to you
all of a sudden?

01:05:37.558 --> 01:05:38.767
Because of the horns, Lee!

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:41.436
Oh, my god, Ig. I can't talk
to you when you're like this.

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:45.315
There's no horns.
You're going crazy. Go home.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:48.735
Why are you wearing
Merrin's cross?

01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:51.988
It's not Merrin's. It's mine.
I've had it forever.

01:05:51.989 --> 01:05:52.614
You think I'm an idiot?

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:56.117
You think I don't know what
Merrin's cross looks like?

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:02.082
Yeah, it's hers.

01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:05.085
She gave it to me.

01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:07.045
Why would she do that?

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.797
- Ig, it was...
- What?

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:12.175
There's things about
Merrin you don't know.

01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:19.474
There's things about Merrin and
me that I haven't told you.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:23.103
What are you talking about?

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:26.356
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for anything to happen.

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:28.608
You were the one she...

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:29.693
Ig, come on.

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:32.112
You're the reason
she was gonna fucking...

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:32.779
We didn't want to hurt you.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.532
If you didn't
want to hurt me you're
doing a fucking lousy job!

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:39.285
Ig, come on.
Ig. Ig, I'm sorry.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.123
Oh, fuck.

01:06:43.624 --> 01:06:44.416
Fuck!

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:47.168
Fuck! Fuck!

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:49.587
You like that
new girl in church?

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:50.547
I don't know her yet.

01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:54.592
Ig, you like her enough
to get me to fix her cross.

01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:56.261
I like her too.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:59.389
She seems, you know, pure.

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:55.528
Get the
hell off my property.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:08:00.075
I know that I'm the last person
you want to see right now...

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:03.620
but you're the only person
I can ask about this.

01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:05.663
I have got nothing
to say to you.

01:08:05.664 --> 01:08:09.375
I should shoot you
right in the heart.

01:08:10.669 --> 01:08:11.086
No.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:15.799
If you really wanted to kill
me, you'd have already done it.

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:18.009
I know that.

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:20.053
These days, I bring out
the worst in people.

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.471
What I want is for you
to tell me the truth

01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:24.974
about what you did
to my daughter.

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.475
And then I want to kill you.

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:30.604
What I need to know is
did Merrin say anything to you

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:34.484
about leaving me or about
being with somebody else?

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:36.486
You got some kind
of nerve. Coming out here

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:41.073
and asking me if my daughter
was unfaithful to you.

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:41.491
But could you...

01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:43.451
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:45.078
Look, you're the only
person she would have told

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:46.955
because you're the only one
who loved her like I did.

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:50.582
Don't you fucking dare
say we're the same.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.505
When I was watching the cancer
devour my wife's insides...

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.799
the only saving grace was I
thought that was the worst

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.176
thing that would ever happen
to me. But boy was I wrong.

01:09:00.176 --> 01:09:03.720
Dale, please, you have
to believe me. I loved her.

01:09:03.721 --> 01:09:07.725
But now I don't know if I
even really knew who she was.

01:09:07.725 --> 01:09:08.725
You think there is
a chance in hell

01:09:08.727 --> 01:09:12.229
I am gonna say one word
to you about my daughter?

01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:14.691
If you're looking for
forgiveness or compassion

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:18.694
or understanding, go
talk to a goddamn priest!

01:09:23.742 --> 01:09:25.493
I know you killed her.

01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:28.872
And I hope you die.
I hope you die...

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:33.751
scared and helpless in the
dirt just like my Merrin did.

01:09:36.796 --> 01:09:39.674
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:09:39.758 --> 01:09:40.966
I shouldn't have come.

01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:45.220
Get off my porch or I
swear I will shoot you.

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:59.045
Aaahhh!!!

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.646
Fuck.

01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:13.453
Sometimes God works
in mysterious ways.

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:16.914
The horns had revealed
so much already.

01:12:16.915 --> 01:12:21.627
Now I can use them to find her
killer and set things right.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.282
See, vanity doesn't pay.
And it's gonna be a long

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:18.494
time before you can even
try and look pretty again.

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:42.518
You know, you guys really want
to stop following me around.

01:14:42.519 --> 01:14:44.979
Telling us what to do now?

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.522
Well...

01:14:47.065 --> 01:14:52.111
I mean, wouldn't you rather just
suck each other off right here?

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.493
What the hell
makes you say that?

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.661
Well, you know, ever since
we were kids I kind of

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:03.748
assumed you maybe had to act
so tough 'cause you were

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:06.542
ashamed of yourself?

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.045
Was I right?

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:11.631
When I was a kid, I used
to shoplift gay porno mags

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:14.675
from the drug store.
And my dad found them under

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:16.511
my bed and he cracked
me with his belt.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:19.972
You see, you both been brought
up to believe it's a sin, but...

01:15:19.973 --> 01:15:21.974
it's just being human.

01:15:21.975 --> 01:15:25.728
That's why I always wanted
to be partnered with Eric.

01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:28.397
I think about him all the
time when I'm whacking off.

01:15:28.398 --> 01:15:32.568
I wanna kiss you on the mouth
when you talk dirty like that.

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:39.951
Have fun, officers.

01:15:44.289 --> 01:15:46.290
Oh, Wallace.

01:15:46.291 --> 01:15:48.167
Come here.

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:07.144
Hey, Terry.

01:16:08.438 --> 01:16:12.149
Ig. I didn't know
you were gonna come by.

01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:13.859
How's it going?

01:16:14.611 --> 01:16:16.988
What's that snake
doing around your neck?

01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:19.490
I made a new friend.

01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:22.994
You want a drink?

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:26.414
Maybe something a
little stronger?

01:16:30.168 --> 01:16:31.419
No.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.796
No, I wanna keep my
head clear tonight.

01:16:33.797 --> 01:16:39.844
But don't let me stop you.
Do as much as you want to do.

01:16:47.894 --> 01:16:51.689
Jesus Christ, Terry, how many
drugs are you doing lately?

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:55.067
If you want to know
the truth, I have...

01:16:55.068 --> 01:16:58.904
I've had a hard time
staying sober, you know,

01:16:58.905 --> 01:17:00.740
ever since Merrin died.

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:04.827
I've actually been on kind
of a bender myself tonight.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.039
Been having a very good time.

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:14.503
That's good.
I'm glad to hear that, Ig.

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:19.091
Shit, look...

01:17:19.092 --> 01:17:24.180
I know things have been tough
for you lately, okay? But...

01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:28.225
Well, understandably,
but I just...

01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:33.689
But here's where the fun ends.

01:17:35.233 --> 01:17:38.444
This is gonna give me
no pleasure at all.

01:17:38.695 --> 01:17:41.614
What are you talking about?

01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:48.162
Well...
you're my big brother, Terry.

01:17:48.872 --> 01:17:52.166
I have always depended on
you to look out for me.

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.919
I have always tried to do my
best by you, Ig. You know that.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:18:00.091
Except when you saw Merrin lying
under that tree in that dirt...

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:03.594
you didn't call an ambulance
and you didn't call the cops.

01:18:03.595 --> 01:18:07.640
You just ran off
and left her there.

01:18:07.724 --> 01:18:11.102
Fuck, Ig, she was already
dead, okay? There was nothing

01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:13.896
I could do. The cops would
have thought that I killed her.

01:18:13.897 --> 01:18:16.232
Even when I got arrested,
you didn't go to them

01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:19.527
and tell them the truth.
No, now why would you?

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:22.863
Why would you do that
unless you were guilty...

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:25.157
unless you actually killed her?

01:18:25.158 --> 01:18:28.494
Because I'm your fucking
brother, that's why.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:29.453
You understand if I-

01:18:29.454 --> 01:18:32.039
I mean, they would have just
thought I was helping you.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.208
But you never even
tried to help me.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:37.878
All you wanted to do
was save your own skin.

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:41.882
You are a selfish
motherfucker, Terry.

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:44.135
And I hate you.

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:47.138
Yeah, you know what?

01:18:51.268 --> 01:18:53.185
You're so fucking right.

01:18:53.186 --> 01:18:54.103
You're right.

01:18:54.104 --> 01:18:57.648
I am evil and you
should kill me, Iggy.

01:18:57.649 --> 01:19:01.152
That's what you should do.
You should fucking kill me.

01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:02.987
I mean, that's what
I deserve, right?

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:05.781
I mean, after what I did,
that's what I fucking deserve.

01:19:05.782 --> 01:19:07.491
The way I see it, I have
every right to kill you...

01:19:07.492 --> 01:19:09.702
but I think I'm gonna let you
live and make you suffer.

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:12.872
Why don't you just
finish all that off.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:19.170
What, all of it?

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:22.214
I think I've made myself clear.

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:17.353
Now there's nowhere left to run.

01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:20.356
You are gonna see
everything she saw...

01:20:20.357 --> 01:20:23.108
and feel what she felt.

01:20:23.109 --> 01:20:26.362
And the worst part is...

01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:30.282
you're gonna live
through all of it.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:24.628
Iggy!

01:21:26.673 --> 01:21:27.923
Iggy!

01:21:36.808 --> 01:21:38.684
Terry?

01:21:54.951 --> 01:21:57.661
Terry! Terry! Terry!

01:21:57.662 --> 01:21:59.872
Help! Iggy!

01:22:00.123 --> 01:22:02.082
Where are you?

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.179
Help me! No!

01:22:34.074 --> 01:22:37.952
Punishing Terry was the
hardest thing I've ever done.

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:40.412
But forcing him to face
his demons was the only

01:22:40.413 --> 01:22:42.539
way I could help him.

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:04.103
Jesus Christ, Ig.

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:05.479
I looked for you everywhere.

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.606
Look, get out of
here before I do something

01:23:07.607 --> 01:23:10.234
we're both gonna regret.

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:13.237
We gotta move past this.
This is not what Merrin wanted.

01:23:13.238 --> 01:23:15.447
So you're the expert on
what Merrin wanted now?

01:23:15.448 --> 01:23:18.492
I was never gonna
tell you anything.

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.452
No.

01:23:21.454 --> 01:23:23.288
So how long was it going
on between you two?

01:23:23.289 --> 01:23:24.623
You don't want to know anything.

01:23:24.624 --> 01:23:26.583
Oh, I need to understand.

01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:30.671
It was just a couple months.

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:33.716
She was moving
out to California.

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:36.010
We wanted to figure out if it
was real before we told anyone.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:39.304
And so when she got killed,
did you think it was me? Or like

01:23:39.305 --> 01:23:42.433
did you think that I found out
about you and lost control?

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:44.560
If I thought you had
anything to do with this,
I wouldn't be helping you.

01:23:44.561 --> 01:23:45.894
Okay, well, I don't want
any more of your help.

01:23:45.895 --> 01:23:47.521
Yeah, I'm the only one who can
help you. I'm gonna prove that

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:49.565
waitress is lying. I'm gonna get
Terry to confess to the police.

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:51.316
Just fucking go, Lee.
Leave me alone.

01:23:51.317 --> 01:23:53.152
And don't fucking touch me!

01:23:53.153 --> 01:23:55.779
The cross, dude! Fuck!

01:24:00.952 --> 01:24:02.953
Are those horns?

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:07.583
Goddamn right, they're horns.

01:24:08.793 --> 01:24:11.045
I'm glad you can
finally see them.

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:12.796
So now you have to
tell me the truth.

01:24:12.797 --> 01:24:15.549
Merrin's cross can't
protect you anymore.

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:17.801
Why should I tell you anything?

01:24:17.802 --> 01:24:20.345
You're not gonna
be able to help it.

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:26.935
I never meant to kill her.

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:29.855
You fuck!

01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:32.524
You fuck.

01:24:33.109 --> 01:24:37.946
I didn't mean to do it, Ig.
I loved her just as much as you.

01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:42.534
I'm the one who fixed her cross.

01:24:43.286 --> 01:24:44.578
She should have been with me.

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:45.871
Oh, you sure as shit fooled me.

01:24:45.872 --> 01:24:48.874
I always thought you spent your
whole life trying to be good!

01:24:48.875 --> 01:24:50.042
I try and control myself.

01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:52.086
But you saved my life when
we were kids. You pulled me out

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:55.172
of the water right here. You're
the only reason I'm alive!

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:57.966
It was the stupidest
mistake I ever made.

01:24:58.051 --> 01:24:59.927
I should have let you drown.

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:02.638
Then I'd be with her now.

01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:04.681
That's a fucking lie!

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:18.737
Thank you for coming to see me.

01:25:18.738 --> 01:25:22.950
Listen, I think Ig is
gonna propose to me.

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:26.078
Do you know anything about that?

01:25:27.163 --> 01:25:27.871
Maybe.

01:25:27.872 --> 01:25:30.624
There are some things
that I've learned about

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:32.960
myself recently and...

01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:39.716
I know now that I
can never marry Ig.

01:25:45.515 --> 01:25:48.350
Why are you telling me this?

01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:58.110
Will you come by
the diner later?

01:25:58.111 --> 01:26:00.779
I really think it will
help if you're there

01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:03.198
when this is all over with.

01:26:04.742 --> 01:26:06.326
Of course.

01:26:09.539 --> 01:26:11.498
Thank you.

01:27:10.183 --> 01:27:11.975
Terry?

01:27:13.603 --> 01:27:14.978
It's me.

01:27:14.979 --> 01:27:16.563
Oh, Lee, wow, you frightened me.

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:18.690
What are you doing out here?
Come on, let's get some dry

01:27:18.691 --> 01:27:20.400
clothes on you. I'll
drive you home. Come on.

01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:23.487
No, No.
I want to be alone right now.

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:25.364
You'll get sick.

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:26.615
No.

01:27:27.867 --> 01:27:29.826
You okay?

01:27:29.827 --> 01:27:31.620
Hey, hey, hey.

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:35.415
Hey.

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.084
Hey.

01:27:37.710 --> 01:27:39.920
Everything's okay.

01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:44.967
I got you.

01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:46.885
I got you.

01:28:04.862 --> 01:28:07.739
What? What are you doing?

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:10.742
There's nobody here.
It's just us.

01:28:11.828 --> 01:28:13.203
You're joking?

01:28:13.204 --> 01:28:15.998
I mean, we don't have
to pretend anymore.

01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:18.917
It's just...
It's fine.

01:28:18.918 --> 01:28:22.546
No, No. No. Stop it!

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:25.048
Don't! Don't do that.

01:28:25.049 --> 01:28:27.968
Just get off me!

01:28:30.722 --> 01:28:34.850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

01:28:34.934 --> 01:28:37.769
I've been waiting for
this for such a long time.

01:28:37.770 --> 01:28:41.481
I can't believe this
is finally happening.

01:28:41.941 --> 01:28:43.775
I need to touch you.

01:28:43.776 --> 01:28:45.610
No.

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:46.903
Feel you, honey.

01:28:46.904 --> 01:28:49.781
No, look. Listen,
you are Ig's best friend.

01:28:49.782 --> 01:28:53.285
You're my friend.
You're my friend.

01:28:53.286 --> 01:28:55.996
Please, don't you
understand anything?

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:59.833
I understand everything.
I understand everything.

01:29:00.626 --> 01:29:03.378
Every time the three of
us hang out together...

01:29:03.379 --> 01:29:07.090
it's like there's this
elephant in the room.

01:29:07.216 --> 01:29:09.760
'Cause we're so clearly
supposed to be together,

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:12.929
but nobody says
anything. You know?

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:15.932
And we stare at each other.

01:29:15.933 --> 01:29:18.727
Merrin, we stare at each other.

01:29:18.728 --> 01:29:22.356
No, let go of me. Don't!

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:24.775
You don't know the
first thing about what

01:29:24.776 --> 01:29:26.068
I'm going through right now.

01:29:26.069 --> 01:29:27.611
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:29:27.612 --> 01:29:30.155
What about all the signals
you've been sending me?

01:29:30.156 --> 01:29:33.742
What? Signals, what?

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:35.952
Merrin.

01:29:35.953 --> 01:29:40.040
Oh my god, you thought that
I broke up with Ig so that...

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.792
No. No.

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:43.627
But you know you love me.

01:29:44.712 --> 01:29:46.713
I love you. I love you.

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:48.590
I love Ig so much.

01:29:48.591 --> 01:29:50.675
Ow!

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:54.262
I love him more than the world.

01:29:56.599 --> 01:30:00.644
That's the last thing she
said, that she loved me.

01:30:00.853 --> 01:30:02.187
Oohh!!

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:06.483
You want to know
what happened, Ig?

01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:06.942
Shut up!

01:30:06.943 --> 01:30:10.070
Ow! I love...
No, no! Please, no!

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:13.824
Stop it! Help! Terry!

01:30:17.453 --> 01:30:19.496
I gave her what she asked for.

01:30:19.497 --> 01:30:21.123
Ahh!!
Jesus!

01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:27.003
Please, Lee!
It's me! It's me!

01:30:27.004 --> 01:30:29.381
I fucked her tight little pussy.

01:30:29.382 --> 01:30:31.800
No! No.

01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:46.189
Then I bashed her
face in with a rock.

01:30:46.190 --> 01:30:47.816
No!

01:31:05.334 --> 01:31:06.960
You know what?

01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:10.755
Love made devils of us both.

01:32:23.412 --> 01:32:27.791
The way I see it, you
confessed to me...

01:32:27.959 --> 01:32:31.962
and you were so
overwhelmed with guilt...

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:33.755
that you killed yourself.

01:32:36.509 --> 01:32:41.263
So much... I always
wanted to try this.

01:32:46.852 --> 01:32:50.730
It's gonna be fun.
It's gonna be fun.

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:52.691
Okay. Hey.

01:33:18.134 --> 01:33:20.051
Aaahhh!!!

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:52.000
Mr. Perrish committed
suicide earlier today.

01:33:52.001 --> 01:33:55.045
We have recovered his vehicle.
Perrish's lawyer Lee Tourneau

01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:58.089
was the only witness at the
scene. Mr. Perrish confessed

01:33:58.090 --> 01:34:01.176
his crimes to Mr. Tourneau
and then killed himself.

01:34:01.177 --> 01:34:03.595
Is there any
validity to the reports that

01:34:03.596 --> 01:34:04.721
no body was found
in the vehicle?

01:34:04.722 --> 01:34:07.182
Any and all reports
originating outside the Gideon

01:34:07.183 --> 01:34:09.768
P.D. should be considered
hearsay and conjecture at

01:34:09.769 --> 01:34:13.772
this time, nothing more.
No further questions.

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:17.734
Breaking news this evening from
the police force in the Merrin

01:34:17.735 --> 01:34:22.197
Williams case. You have heard
tonight that Ig Perrish has

01:34:22.198 --> 01:34:25.241
reportedly driven his
vehicle into the bay.

01:34:25.242 --> 01:34:29.371
Although as of now, no
body has been recovered.

01:35:17.294 --> 01:35:20.463
Well, one thing I'll
say in my favor...

01:35:20.464 --> 01:35:23.508
I am fucking hard to kill.

01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:40.233
Why the
hell aren't you dead?

01:35:41.777 --> 01:35:45.447
The truth is I don't know the
answer to that question myself.

01:35:45.448 --> 01:35:50.410
I have prayed for so
long for you to die...

01:35:50.411 --> 01:35:54.914
but when I saw
the news on the TV...

01:35:55.124 --> 01:35:58.126
it didn't help one bit.

01:36:00.755 --> 01:36:04.382
I didn't kill her, Mr. Williams.

01:36:05.593 --> 01:36:09.554
But you know who
did it, don't you?

01:36:12.016 --> 01:36:13.850
You gotta tell me.

01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:16.102
What will you if I tell you?

01:36:16.103 --> 01:36:17.520
You know what I'll do.

01:36:17.521 --> 01:36:19.814
But this is my job.

01:36:19.815 --> 01:36:23.443
People say you should
always do the right thing.

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:26.696
Sometimes there
is no right thing.

01:36:27.323 --> 01:36:29.324
And then...

01:36:30.159 --> 01:36:34.454
Well then you just have to pick
the sin you can live with.

01:36:40.002 --> 01:36:42.253
Why don't you come inside.

01:36:46.592 --> 01:36:51.471
Yesterday I was wandering around
the house and I found this.

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:58.520
I thought maybe I should
give it to the police, but...

01:36:58.896 --> 01:37:01.397
that didn't feel right.

01:37:04.109 --> 01:37:07.111
She wanted you to have this.

01:37:12.368 --> 01:37:14.410
Thank you.

01:37:16.497 --> 01:37:21.042
And there's something
I would like to give you.

01:37:24.129 --> 01:37:25.338
Here.

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:33.263
Merrin's mother, she gave
this to her just before she...

01:37:34.557 --> 01:37:37.141
You know, son, I think...

01:37:38.769 --> 01:37:42.146
I think you need this
even more than I do.

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:46.276
I think you need her
to keep you safe.

01:38:16.265 --> 01:38:17.765
Well now...

01:38:17.766 --> 01:38:21.769
I guess maybe that's some
kind of blessing after all.

01:38:32.698 --> 01:38:35.742
The horns weren't
a curse, but a blessing.

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:38.494
They had guided me this far.

01:38:39.747 --> 01:38:41.623
And when I put on her cross...

01:38:41.624 --> 01:38:45.001
I could feel her
protecting me again.

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:56.155
Dear Ig...

01:39:56.699 --> 01:40:00.243
you'll never read
this while I'm alive.

01:40:00.744 --> 01:40:05.581
I'm not even sure I want you
to read it after I'm dead.

01:40:07.042 --> 01:40:10.628
I think you're gonna ask
me to marry you soon.

01:40:10.921 --> 01:40:14.716
You don't know how
much I want to say yes.

01:40:16.135 --> 01:40:18.011
But I can't.

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:18.928
What?

01:40:18.929 --> 01:40:21.097
The thing is, Ig, I'm very sick.

01:40:21.098 --> 01:40:26.602
The sort of cancer I have is
the kind that runs in families.

01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:30.106
I saw my mother go through it...

01:40:30.107 --> 01:40:32.567
and I saw what it
did to my father.

01:40:32.568 --> 01:40:34.944
If I tell you I'm sick,
you're just gonna wanna

01:40:34.945 --> 01:40:40.366
marry me even more.
And I'll be weak and say yes.

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:44.287
Then you'll give up your future
and be shackled to me...

01:40:44.288 --> 01:40:47.582
as I go through
hell and die anyway.

01:40:47.583 --> 01:40:50.793
I won't put you through it.

01:40:51.378 --> 01:40:53.129
I love you too much.

01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:57.759
My plan is to hurt you,
just enough to push you away.

01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:01.512
And hopefully one day
you can forgive me...

01:41:01.513 --> 01:41:03.639
and you will move
on to someone else.

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:06.559
You'll have children,
grandchildren and

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:11.856
great-grandchildren. You will
go for long walks in the woods.

01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:15.318
On one of these walks,
when you're very old...

01:41:15.319 --> 01:41:20.573
you'll find yourself at a tree,
with a house in its branches.

01:41:21.158 --> 01:41:23.367
I'll be waiting for you there.

01:41:23.368 --> 01:41:27.330
I'll be waiting by candlelight
in our treehouse...

01:41:27.331 --> 01:41:31.042
shining the light of my
cross into your eyes.

01:41:31.043 --> 01:41:34.545
The first message
I ever sent you.

01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:36.923
Us.

01:41:38.217 --> 01:41:40.718
I love you, Iggy Perrish.

01:41:40.719 --> 01:41:43.638
Your girl, Merrin.

01:42:00.489 --> 01:42:03.199
Iggy, you're alive.

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:05.660
You know-don't.

01:42:07.704 --> 01:42:09.288
Iggy...

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:12.708
we have to clear your name.

01:42:13.168 --> 01:42:16.045
We need to figure out
who really killed Merrin.

01:42:16.046 --> 01:42:17.797
It was Lee.

01:42:19.258 --> 01:42:22.593
If you're going after Lee,
then I am coming with you.

01:42:22.594 --> 01:42:24.512
Terry, you're not
strong enough for that.

01:42:24.513 --> 01:42:27.557
I am not leaving you.

01:42:27.558 --> 01:42:31.644
I made myself a promise.
Never again.

01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:40.611
If anything happens to me, I
need to know you're all right.

01:42:40.612 --> 01:42:43.322
And for Mom and Dad's sake.

01:43:01.383 --> 01:43:03.301
I'll be damned.

01:43:03.302 --> 01:43:05.261
You and me both.

01:43:05.846 --> 01:43:07.388
What are you doing out here, Ig?

01:43:07.389 --> 01:43:11.809
You don't remember anything that
happened between us, do you?

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:13.936
You wanna come inside?

01:43:13.937 --> 01:43:17.607
No, actually I was hoping
we could go for a walk.

01:43:17.733 --> 01:43:19.317
I mean, nobody's looking for me.

01:43:19.318 --> 01:43:22.069
Pretty much everyone in
town thinks I'm dead.

01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:23.696
No shit.

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:25.406
So what do you say?

01:43:25.407 --> 01:43:27.575
It's just a walk?

01:43:27.576 --> 01:43:28.826
Yeah.

01:43:34.458 --> 01:43:36.125
Okay.

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:57.146
Why'd you bring us here?

01:43:57.147 --> 01:43:58.981
You know why.

01:44:00.609 --> 01:44:03.819
Because this is where
you killed Merrin.

01:44:07.658 --> 01:44:09.784
What happened to you?

01:44:10.702 --> 01:44:12.370
You lost your mind?

01:44:12.371 --> 01:44:15.748
Things are gonna go a
lot easier for both of us

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:18.209
if you don't lie to me.

01:44:26.927 --> 01:44:28.552
Ig...

01:44:31.598 --> 01:44:34.934
I'm your best friend.
You've known me your whole life.

01:44:34.935 --> 01:44:36.936
Do you think I had
something to do with this?

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:42.483
Believe me, all I want
to do is kill you.

01:44:43.652 --> 01:44:46.570
But I am trying to be human.

01:44:46.571 --> 01:44:50.408
I am trying to be the kind of
man Merrin wanted me to be.

01:44:50.409 --> 01:44:55.579
And so I am giving you this
chance to do the right thing.

01:44:58.750 --> 01:45:01.335
We are gonna go down
to the police station.

01:45:01.336 --> 01:45:01.794
Okay.

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:02.920
You are gonna turn yourself in.

01:45:02.921 --> 01:45:06.716
Keep your
hands where I can see them, Lee.

01:45:06.717 --> 01:45:08.926
Don't do anything stupid.

01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:10.803
Oh, Terry.

01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:12.763
What the fuck you
doing here, Terry?

01:45:12.764 --> 01:45:14.890
Terry came to
talk to me just now.

01:45:14.891 --> 01:45:17.351
Told me some things about
the night that Merrin died.

01:45:17.352 --> 01:45:19.895
Anything he said, he's just
trying to save his own ass.

01:45:19.896 --> 01:45:20.813
Go fuck yourself.

01:45:20.814 --> 01:45:21.480
Yeah, fuck you too.

01:45:21.481 --> 01:45:24.567
You told everybody
that Ig confessed to you

01:45:24.568 --> 01:45:27.236
and then killed himself.

01:45:28.071 --> 01:45:29.864
At least one of those
things isn't true.

01:45:29.865 --> 01:45:34.785
So now I'm wondering, what else
you were lying to me about.

01:45:34.786 --> 01:45:36.037
Fuck.

01:45:38.999 --> 01:45:40.499
I'm sorry.

01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:44.754
I'm sorry.

01:45:45.464 --> 01:45:48.632
I'm so sorry.
I have to-Okay.

01:45:49.926 --> 01:45:52.511
I didn't mean to hurt her.

01:45:52.971 --> 01:45:55.890
It was a mistake.
I'm sorry.

01:45:56.433 --> 01:45:57.850
I'm sorry.

01:45:58.769 --> 01:46:01.896
Okay. I'm gonna
do the right thing. Okay.

01:46:04.274 --> 01:46:06.484
Okay, I'm gonna fix
all of this, okay?

01:46:06.485 --> 01:46:07.818
You're doing good.

01:46:07.819 --> 01:46:08.944
Okay.

01:46:08.945 --> 01:46:13.282
That's right.
We've been friends a long time.

01:46:18.455 --> 01:46:18.871
Fuck, Lee!

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:21.957
Why don't you
put the goddamn gun down.

01:46:38.183 --> 01:46:40.434
Back the fuck up.

01:46:40.602 --> 01:46:42.603
Back the fuck up.

01:46:43.605 --> 01:46:46.565
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:46:50.404 --> 01:46:54.198
I'm so sorry, Merrin.
I'll see you soon.

01:47:06.962 --> 01:47:08.712
Aaarrgghh!!

01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:40.161
Aaarrgghh!!

01:47:59.347 --> 01:48:00.973
No!

01:48:24.956 --> 01:48:27.041
Please, Ig.

01:51:54.708 --> 01:51:56.250
Ig?

01:52:07.721 --> 01:52:11.014
In the end
I embraced the horns.

01:52:11.015 --> 01:52:13.809
Like an angel who
fell to earth...

01:52:13.810 --> 01:52:16.937
I became a devil one last time.

01:52:18.148 --> 01:52:20.482
But revenge is all consuming.

01:52:20.483 --> 01:52:23.235
And my time has come
to return to you...

01:52:23.236 --> 01:52:25.863
so we can be together again.

01:52:38.334 --> 01:52:39.334
No, no, I swear.

01:52:39.335 --> 01:52:44.673
I mean, if this isn't paradise,
I don't know what is.

01:52:52.932 --> 01:52:55.017
Are you horny?

01:52:55.643 --> 01:52:57.686
I'm getting warmer.

01:52:57.687 --> 01:53:00.022
Oh, fine.

01:53:02.358 --> 01:53:03.817
No.

01:53:04.235 --> 01:53:05.235
Yes.

01:53:05.236 --> 01:53:07.112
No.

01:53:17.248 --> 01:53:20.834
I'm gonna love you for
the rest of my life.

01:53:26.174 --> 01:53:29.843
Just love me for
the rest of mine.
