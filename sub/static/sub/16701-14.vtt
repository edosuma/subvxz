00:16.548 --> 00:21.320
AND YOU EXPECT ME TO KEEP
PAYING FOR THESE LESSONS?

00:21.353 --> 00:23.322
WELL, I THOUGHT
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

00:23.355 --> 00:27.160
WAS THAT IN THE KEY
OF E-CRAP?

00:29.094 --> 00:32.664
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN
TO HAVE MUSICAL SKILLS.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.667
AND AS SOON AS I HEAR
MUSICAL SKILLS,

00:34.700 --> 00:36.335
WE'LL PAY FOR MORE LESSONS.

00:36.368 --> 00:39.806
KYLE, THROW THAT THING
IN THE TRASH.

00:36.368 --> 00:39.806
YES!

00:39.838 --> 00:41.440
NEXT!

00:41.473 --> 00:44.810
(Cheryl) OH, THERE'S
MY LITTLE SOCCER STAR.

00:44.844 --> 00:48.146
GRACIE, TELL US WHY WE SHOULD
PAY FOR ANOTHER YEAR OF SOCCER.

00:48.179 --> 00:51.317
I'M OUT OF YOUR HAIR
FOR THREE HOURS EVERY SATURDAY.

00:51.350 --> 00:53.518
YOU MAY CONTINUE.

00:53.551 --> 00:55.755
HERE'S A CHECK.

00:55.787 --> 00:57.089
NEXT!

00:57.122 --> 01:00.759
OH, GOD.
A TAP-DANCING CHILD?

01:00.792 --> 01:03.630
BETTER EARN THOSE
FANCY SHOES OF YOURS, GIRL.

01:25.284 --> 01:27.387
SIGN IT.

01:28.787 --> 01:31.791
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

01:44.236 --> 01:46.139
<i> (thinking)
 THIS TREASURE SNOOPER T-700</i>

01:46.171 --> 01:48.307
<i> IS THE BEST INVESTMENT
 I'VE EVER MADE.</i>

01:48.340 --> 01:52.311
<i> GOOD-BYE, LOSER WEEKENDS.
 HELLO, METAL DETECTING.</i>

01:53.745 --> 01:55.313
<i> WELL, HELLO, LADIES.</i>

01:55.346 --> 01:58.316
<i> WHAT'S SEXIER THAN A MAN
 WHO CAN FIND TREASURE?</i>

01:58.349 --> 01:59.851
WHOO!

01:58.349 --> 01:59.851
(both laughing)

01:59.885 --> 02:04.689
<i> HMM. MUST BE SOMETHING FUNNY
 GOING ON BEHIND ME.</i>

02:04.722 --> 02:06.558
<i> GUESS I MISSED IT.</i>

02:08.294 --> 02:09.762
(beeps)

02:09.794 --> 02:11.296
<i> OOH, OOH!</i>

02:11.330 --> 02:13.466
<i> PLEASE BE GOLD COINS!
 PLEASE BE GOLD COINS!</i>

02:13.498 --> 02:15.234
<i> HEY, A NICKEL...</i>

02:15.266 --> 02:17.569
<i> FROM 1988.</i>

02:17.603 --> 02:20.272
<i> IT'S LIKE A WINDOW

02:22.775 --> 02:24.576
(beeps)

02:24.610 --> 02:27.380
<i> PLEASE BE GOLD COINS!
 PLEASE BE GOLD COINS!</i>

02:27.413 --> 02:28.915
<i> A WEDDING RING?</i>

 JIM'S WEDDING RING!</i>

02:36.854 --> 02:40.393
<i> I REMEMBER WHEN
 HE LOST THIS A YEAR AGO.</i>

02:40.425 --> 02:41.560
<i> (laughs)</i>

02:41.593 --> 02:44.864
<i> THAT RASCAL HAS WORN
 A CHEAP LOOK-ALIKE EVER SINCE,</i>

02:44.896 --> 02:47.332
<i> AND CHERYL'S
 NEVER BEEN THE WISER.</i>

02:47.366 --> 02:49.702
<i> GOD, I LOVE THAT GUY.</i>

02:53.705 --> 02:55.774
ANDY! ANDY!

02:55.807 --> 02:56.975
WHAT DID--

02:57.008 --> 02:59.811
WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT
DIGGING HOLES IN MY FRONT YARD?

02:59.844 --> 03:01.948
<i> I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW HIM.</i>

03:01.980 --> 03:04.783
WHAT--WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE THAT THING BACK

03:04.817 --> 03:06.919
TO YOUR HOUSE AND USE IT
TO TRY TO FIND A LIFE?

03:06.951 --> 03:10.455
<i> WOW. HE'S REALLY MAD
 ABOUT SOMETHING BEHIND ME.</i>

03:10.489 --> 03:12.325
<i> HMM. MUST'VE MISSED IT.</i>

03:12.358 --> 03:14.393
<i> THINGS HAPPEN FAST
 AROUND HERE.</i>

03:14.425 --> 03:15.694
HEY! HEY!

03:15.728 --> 03:17.730
WHAT,
YOU'RE GONNA IGNORE ME?

03:17.763 --> 03:19.731
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO?

03:19.764 --> 03:22.601
ALL RIGHT, ANDY.
ALL RIGHT. (grunts)

03:22.634 --> 03:25.570
<i>WOW. JIM'S SQUIRTING ME
 WITH A HOSE.</i>

03:25.604 --> 03:28.474
<i> WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
 I'M HIS BEST FRIEND.</i>

03:28.507 --> 03:29.875
(gasps)

03:29.907 --> 03:33.345
<i> I KNOW.
 I MUST BE ON FIRE.</i>

03:33.378 --> 03:35.647
<i> STOP, DROP AND ROLL!
 STOP, DROP AND ROLL!</i>

03:35.681 --> 03:36.949
<i> STOP, DROP AND ROLL!</i>

03:36.981 --> 03:39.318
NEXT TIME I'M GONNA
GET MY BB GUN,

03:39.350 --> 03:42.354
AND WE'LL SEE IF YOU CAN DETECT
METAL FLYING INTO YOUR ASS!

03:46.758 --> 03:49.762
(engine starts)

03:52.397 --> 03:54.332
<i> I WASN'T ON FIRE AT ALL.</i>

03:54.366 --> 03:56.636
<i> HE'S JUST A BIG, STUPID JERK.</i>

03:56.669 --> 03:58.871
<i> WELL, I'LL SHOW HIM.</i>

03:58.903 --> 04:02.808
(laughing)

04:04.742 --> 04:07.646
WHAT IS SO FUNNY BEHIND ME?

04:28.966 --> 04:30.969
POOR ANDY.

04:31.002 --> 04:34.639
EVEN WITH THAT THING,
YOU CAN'T FIND YOUR DIGNITY.

04:34.673 --> 04:36.641
OH, DANA,
GIVE HIM A BREAK.

04:36.675 --> 04:40.413
IT WAS SMALL AND HARD TO FIND
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.015
AH, CHERYL,
BIG SIS... (laughs)

04:43.048 --> 04:45.685
ALWAYS THERE WITH
A CLEVER QUIP AND AN APRON.

04:45.718 --> 04:48.420
THAT REMINDS ME.
WHAT WAS THE FUNNY THING

04:48.454 --> 04:50.355
YOU HAD ENGRAVED
ON JIM'S WEDDING RING?

04:50.389 --> 04:52.625
OH... (laughs)
"JIM, PUT THIS BACK ON.

04:52.658 --> 04:54.960
LOVE, CHERYL."

04:52.658 --> 04:54.960
(laughs)

04:54.992 --> 04:57.430
HUH. THAT'S FUNNY.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.665
THAT'S WHAT THIS RING SAYS
THAT I JUST FOUND

04:59.697 --> 05:01.834
BURIED IN THE FRONT YARD
UNDER 2 INCHES OF <i> LIES.</i>

05:01.867 --> 05:05.771
WHAT?
JIM LOST HIS WEDDING RING?

05:05.803 --> 05:08.940
YEAH, A YEAR AGO, AND HE'S BEEN
WEARING A FAKE ONE EVER SINCE.

05:05.803 --> 05:08.940
(gasps)

05:08.973 --> 05:11.810
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE LOST IT A YEAR AGO?

05:11.843 --> 05:14.413
(chuckling) DANA...
SWEET, STUPID DANA.

05:16.848 --> 05:20.652
A SEASONED TREASURE HUNTER
CAN ANALYZE THE SOIL

05:20.685 --> 05:23.955
AND THE POSITION OF
SAID ARTIFACT IN DETERMINING--

05:23.988 --> 05:26.758
YOU WERE WITH HIM
WHEN HE LOST IT.

05:26.791 --> 05:29.661
IT WAS A WARM SPRING DAY...

05:29.694 --> 05:31.963
<i> A DAY WHICH FOUND
 JIM AND I IN POSSESSION</i>

05:31.997 --> 05:33.966
<i> OF A WATER BALLOON CATAPULT</i>

05:33.999 --> 05:36.669
<i> AND THE GOOD SENSE
 TO KNOW WHERE TO USE IT.</i>

05:36.701 --> 05:38.504
ALL RIGHT. GUNS UP!

05:36.701 --> 05:38.504
(Andy grunts)

05:38.536 --> 05:40.372
10 BUCKS IF YOU HIT
DRISCOLL'S MAILBOX!

05:40.406 --> 05:43.042
10 BUCKS IF YOU DON'T
LEAN BACK SO FAR.

05:43.074 --> 05:45.677
FIRE IN THE HOLE!

05:45.711 --> 05:48.547
(Andy) OH, GREAT SHOT!

05:45.711 --> 05:48.547
(Jim laughs)

05:48.579 --> 05:50.548
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ELSE WE GOT?

05:50.581 --> 05:52.550
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

05:50.581 --> 05:52.550
MMM.

05:52.584 --> 05:54.519
LOOKS LIKE AL CRANNIS
PICKED THE WRONG DAY

05:54.552 --> 05:56.689
TO LEAVE THE SUNROOF OPEN
IN HIS CAR.

05:56.721 --> 05:57.923
(laughs)

05:57.956 --> 05:59.525
GUNS UP!

05:59.557 --> 06:01.026
(grunts)

06:01.059 --> 06:02.528
FIRE IN THE HOLE!

06:02.560 --> 06:03.661
(grunts)

06:03.694 --> 06:05.430
(Jim) OHH!

06:05.463 --> 06:07.565
(Andy laughing) OHH.

06:07.598 --> 06:08.800
(Jim) YEAH!

06:08.834 --> 06:11.603
(laughing)

06:11.637 --> 06:13.639
(Andy) OH, YEAH!

06:13.672 --> 06:14.939
(both laughing)

06:14.973 --> 06:16.475
TOUCHDOWN! TOUCHDOWN!

06:16.507 --> 06:18.944
AWESOME.

06:20.178 --> 06:21.946
FIRE IN THE HOLE!

06:21.980 --> 06:23.149
YOW!

06:25.617 --> 06:27.720
OOH!

06:25.617 --> 06:27.720
OH! (laughs)

06:27.752 --> 06:32.123
HEY, I'M GONNA KICK
YOUR BUTTS, YOU OLD JERKS!

06:32.156 --> 06:34.560
OOH. OH, MY GOD.

06:34.593 --> 06:37.196
OH, CRAP, CRAP,
CRAP, CRAP, CRAP!

06:37.228 --> 06:39.697
WHAT'S THE MATTER? SHE'S 5.
WE COULD TAKE HER.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.199
NO, I'VE LOST IT.

06:41.233 --> 06:43.102
WHAT?

06:41.233 --> 06:43.102
I LOST MY WEDDING RING.

06:43.134 --> 06:45.004
IT'S GOTTA BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

06:45.036 --> 06:48.807
IT COULDN'T HAVE GONE FAR.

06:45.036 --> 06:48.807
AH, I'D SAY 100 YARDS
WITH A GOOD TAILWIND.

06:48.841 --> 06:50.442
CRAP!

06:50.475 --> 06:53.612
MAYBE IT'S IN THE FRONT YARD.
HEY, YOU'RE A BIG NERD.

06:53.644 --> 06:56.649
YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE, UH,
METAL DETECTORS, DON'T YA?

06:56.682 --> 06:58.651
I'VE BEEN KICKIN' THE TIRES
ON A COUPLE,

06:58.684 --> 07:01.053
BUT THE ONLINE BUZZ SAYS
WAIT FOR THE T-700.

07:01.086 --> 07:04.689
AND "NERD'S"
A LITTLE HARSH.

07:01.086 --> 07:04.689
CHERYL'S GONNA GET
A LITTLE HARSH

07:04.723 --> 07:07.927
IF I DON'T FIND THAT RING!
COME ON.

07:04.723 --> 07:07.927
OKAY.

07:07.959 --> 07:09.727
JEEZ, JIM...

07:07.959 --> 07:09.727
(grunts)

07:09.761 --> 07:12.064
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF YOU
CAN'T FIND YOUR RING?

07:12.096 --> 07:14.500
I DON'T KNOW. I'M DEAD.
FOR SOME REASON,

07:14.533 --> 07:16.936
CHERYL'S ALWAYS MADE
A BIG DEAL ABOUT THE RING.

07:16.968 --> 07:18.137
WOMEN.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.039
YEAH.

07:20.072 --> 07:23.475
YOU KNOW, I COULD JUST
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

07:20.072 --> 07:23.475
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.478
I MEAN,
SHE'S A REASONABLE WOMAN.

07:25.511 --> 07:27.880
SHE KNOWS ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.
I MEAN, LOOK AT KYLE.

07:27.913 --> 07:29.848
YEAH, WE'LL FIND IT.

07:29.882 --> 07:32.918
YO!

07:32.951 --> 07:35.621
CHERYL.

07:35.653 --> 07:38.891
YOU DO SOMETHING NEW
WITH YOUR HAIR?

07:40.892 --> 07:43.161
DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING,
JIM?

07:44.896 --> 07:47.098
YES. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

07:48.699 --> 07:51.536
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

07:51.569 --> 07:53.238
HAPPY HALLOWEEN?

07:53.271 --> 07:55.540
WHAT?

07:55.574 --> 07:58.143
YOU FORGOT TO PICK UP THE GIRLS
AT THEIR DANCE LESSON...

07:58.175 --> 08:01.846
TODAY OF ALL DAYS, AFTER I HAD
TO BEG, BORROW AND STEAL

08:01.879 --> 08:05.183
FOR AN APPOINTMENT WITH TODD,
THE HAIR GENIUS OF OAK PARK.

08:05.216 --> 08:08.187
I WAS HALFWAY THROUGH MY WEAVE
WHEN MY CELL PHONE RINGS,

08:08.220 --> 08:10.556
AND IT'S RUBY, CRYING
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T SHOW!

08:10.588 --> 08:13.158
SO I HAD TO LEAVE THE SALON,
PICK THE GIRLS UP,

08:13.190 --> 08:15.627
GO TO THE CRAFT STORE
FOR THEIR BEADING PROJECT

08:15.661 --> 08:19.197
WHERE I RAN INTO <i> EVERYBODY
 I KNOW</i> LOOKING LIKE THIS!

08:19.230 --> 08:21.634
AND NOW THAT MY HAIR COLOR
IS PROCESSED

08:21.666 --> 08:23.868
FOR 2 HOURS
INSTEAD OF 20 MINUTES,

08:23.901 --> 08:26.104
I AM GONNA LOOK
LIKE ANDY WARHOL!

08:26.137 --> 08:29.108
THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST
IRRESPONSIBLE THING

08:29.141 --> 08:30.810
YOU HAVE EVER DONE!

08:32.344 --> 08:35.548
YES.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.716
YES, IT IS.

08:39.683 --> 08:42.220
DID YOU TWO BOZOS
EVEN LOOK FOR THE RING?

08:42.254 --> 08:44.690
WELL, WE WERE GOING TO,
BUT THEN WE REALIZED

08:44.722 --> 08:47.592
WE COULD FILL WATER BALLOONS
WITH PEE.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.894
ONCE WE WERE BORED WITH THAT,
SUMMER WAS OVER.

08:49.927 --> 08:52.331
THEN IT SNOWED.

08:52.364 --> 08:56.134
SO HE'S BEEN LYING
ABOUT THIS FOR A YEAR?

08:56.168 --> 08:58.137
OH, CHERYL, YOU KNOW HIM.
HE'LL SAY...

08:58.169 --> 09:00.639
(imitating Jim)
"I JUST DIDN'T TELL YOU,

09:00.672 --> 09:03.175
AND THAT'S NOT
THE SAME AS LYING."

09:06.711 --> 09:08.346
OH, NO. HE LIED.

09:08.379 --> 09:12.083
CHERYL, I SWEAR ON THIS RING

09:12.116 --> 09:16.822
I DID NOT HEAVE WATER BALLOONS
AT AL CRANNIS' CAR.

09:19.057 --> 09:20.292
CHERYL,

09:20.325 --> 09:23.128
I SWEAR ON THIS RING

09:23.160 --> 09:25.330
I DID NOT TEACH KYLE
THAT WORD.

09:26.898 --> 09:30.636
I SWEAR ON THIS RING,
IT WAS HERE WHEN I WOKE UP.

09:39.677 --> 09:41.312
HE WAS NEVER GONNA TELL ME.

09:41.346 --> 09:45.017
HE SWORE OVER AND OVER
AGAIN ON A FAKE RING.

09:45.049 --> 09:47.185
CHERYL, FOR ONCE
IN THIS TWISTED MARRIAGE,

09:47.219 --> 09:49.922
YOU HAVE COLD, HARD EVIDENCE.
YOU SHOULD NAIL HIM.

09:49.955 --> 09:52.791
OH, OH, I AM GONNA NAIL HIM.<i>
 I</i> WILL NAIL HIM.

09:52.823 --> 09:55.026
HE IS NAILED!

09:55.059 --> 09:57.395
HOW DO I DO THAT?

09:57.428 --> 10:00.231
EASY. WE TIE HIM UP
AND BEAT HIM. I'VE GOT A BAT.

10:00.264 --> 10:02.067
OH, GREAT IDEA.
WE CAN TAKE TURNS.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.269
NO, NO. I MEAN, HITTING HIM
WOULD FEEL GOOD...

10:04.302 --> 10:06.305
REALLY GOOD...

10:06.337 --> 10:08.740
BUT THAT'S JUST TEMPORARY.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.277
DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU HIT HIM.

10:13.044 --> 10:14.312
ANDY.

10:14.346 --> 10:18.216
MORE SATISFYING
WOULD BE A CONFESSION.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.119
YOU'LL NEVER GET HIM
TO CONFESS.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.221
HE ALWAYS TALKS HIS WAY
OUT OF THESE THINGS.

10:22.254 --> 10:25.923
(gasps) WE COULD BEAT
A CONFESSION OUT OF HIM.

10:22.254 --> 10:25.923
YES! I'VE GOT A BAT.

10:25.956 --> 10:28.826
NO. NO. WE ARE GONNA BE
MORE SUBTLE.

10:28.860 --> 10:32.764
WE ARE GONNA USE CUPCAKES.

10:34.365 --> 10:36.999
I'LL BRING MY BAT.

10:36.033 --> 10:38.003
GOOD IDEA.

10:46.912 --> 10:49.114
OKAY, EVERYBODY.
LOOK WHAT I MADE...

10:49.147 --> 10:52.317
MMM.

10:49.147 --> 10:52.317
MY CHOCOLATE SWIRL
SINFUL CUPCAKES.

10:52.350 --> 10:54.720
OH! THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE!

10:54.753 --> 10:58.323
I KNOW--
DEEP, DARK CHOCOLATE.

10:58.355 --> 10:59.725
MMM.

10:58.355 --> 10:59.725
BUT FIRST...

10:59.758 --> 11:03.362
EVERYBODY HAS TO TELL
A DEEP, DARK SECRET.

11:03.394 --> 11:04.697
OH!

11:04.730 --> 11:07.032
COME ON, CHERYL,
WE'RE NOT 4 YEARS OLD.

11:07.065 --> 11:10.402
LET'S JUST
EAT THE CUPCAKES.

11:07.065 --> 11:10.402
UH! NO SECRET, NO CUPCAKE.

11:10.434 --> 11:12.303
(Andy)
I'LL GO. I'LL GO. OKAY.

11:12.336 --> 11:15.407
UM, REMEMBER THAT LAVENDER TIE
YOU BOUGHT ME?

11:12.336 --> 11:15.407
THE ONE I HAD MONOGRAMMED?

11:15.440 --> 11:17.309
I LOST IT
DOING SOMETHING STUPID,

11:17.341 --> 11:19.745
AND RATHER THAN TELL YOU,
I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT

11:19.778 --> 11:21.747
A SIMILAR ONE,
AND YOU NEVER CAUGHT ON.

11:21.779 --> 11:23.749
I-I'M A TERRIBLE MAN.

11:23.782 --> 11:26.719
SOUNDS LIKE
SOMETHING I WOULD DO.

11:26.751 --> 11:29.987
DOESN'T IT?

11:30.020 --> 11:32.957
OH, ANDY, THAT'S SILLY.
YOU'RE FAMILY.

11:32.990 --> 11:34.826
I WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD.

11:34.860 --> 11:38.330
RIGHT, JIM? I MEAN,
ANYBODY CAN LOSE SOMETHING.

11:38.363 --> 11:42.301
YOU SHOULD HAVE
JUST TOLD HER.

11:38.363 --> 11:42.301
I KNOW. THE COVER-UP IS
ACTUALLY WORSE THAN THE CRIME.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.469
(chuckles) IT ALWAYS IS.

11:49.274 --> 11:51.110
CAN WE JUST EAT THE CUPCAKES?

11:51.143 --> 11:55.013
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.
ANDY, HERE'S YOURS.

11:55.046 --> 11:57.783
HA HA HA! MMM. MMM!

11:55.046 --> 11:57.783
MMM.

11:57.816 --> 11:59.884
DELICIOUS.
THIS IS A GOOD CUPCAKE,

11:59.918 --> 12:03.154
BUT NOT AS GOOD
AS A CLEAN CONSCIENCE.

11:59.918 --> 12:03.154
MMM.

12:04.489 --> 12:06.792
OKAY, MY TURN.

12:06.825 --> 12:09.094
LAST WEEK,
I WAS UP ON THE ROOF

12:09.126 --> 12:11.796
THROWING WATER BALLOONS
FILLED WITH MY OWN URINE.

12:15.866 --> 12:18.770
AND...

12:20.938 --> 12:24.509
I LOST THE BRACELET
THAT CHERYL GAVE ME.

12:24.543 --> 12:27.012
THE ONE I HAD ENGRAVED?

12:30.215 --> 12:32.218
I'M SUCH A JERK.

12:35.486 --> 12:39.490
IS THERE SOMETHING WEIRD
GOING ON BEHIND ME?

12:39.524 --> 12:42.494
YOU KNOW, DANA, I COULD HAVE
HELPED YOU LOOK FOR THAT

12:42.527 --> 12:44.096
WITH MY METAL DETECTOR.

12:44.129 --> 12:46.798
OH, THE TREASURE SNOOPER
T-7000?

12:44.129 --> 12:46.798
HUNDRED.

12:46.831 --> 12:50.201
HUNDRED, YEAH. YOU COULD
FIND ANYTHING WITH THAT.

12:46.831 --> 12:50.201
(laughs) YEAH.

12:50.235 --> 12:52.805
YOU KNOW, DANA, AT LEAST
YOU DIDN'T HIDE IT FROM ME

12:52.837 --> 12:54.539
FOR WEEKS, MONTHS
OR EVEN A YEAR.

12:52.837 --> 12:54.539
YEAH.

12:54.572 --> 12:57.543
I MEAN, THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN REALLY HURTFUL.

12:54.572 --> 12:57.543
YEAH.

13:01.479 --> 13:04.216
DON'T YOU THINK SO,
JIM?

13:04.249 --> 13:06.552
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

13:06.585 --> 13:12.158
I THINK YE WHO LEAST JUDGE
JUDGE THE LEAST.

13:15.293 --> 13:17.797
NOW MAY I HAVE YE CUPCAKE?

13:19.563 --> 13:21.966
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR CONFESSION.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.003
SURE.

13:27.639 --> 13:30.842
WELL, NOT UNLIKE DANA,
I WAS ON THE ROOF...

13:32.509 --> 13:35.379
THIS IS VERY HARD
FOR ME TO SAY.

13:35.413 --> 13:38.082
GO AHEAD, JIM. IT'S TIME.

13:40.585 --> 13:43.221
WELL, I WAS UP ON THE ROOF.

13:43.254 --> 13:46.524
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I WAS UP THERE.

13:46.557 --> 13:50.062
ANYWAY, I... I LOST...

13:51.996 --> 13:54.632
I-I LOST...

13:54.666 --> 13:56.569
HOPE.

13:58.970 --> 14:02.341
MY WHOLE LIFE JUST SEEMED
A LITTLE BLEAK TO ME.

14:03.607 --> 14:07.211
THEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS
AND TOOK A NAP,

14:07.245 --> 14:09.581
AND I FOUND HOPE AGAIN.

14:12.283 --> 14:15.553
THAT'S YOUR BIG CONFESSION?
YOU LOST HOPE?

14:15.586 --> 14:18.624
I KNOW. IT WAS THE WORST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

14:18.657 --> 14:21.493
I SWEAR ON MY RING.

14:26.431 --> 14:29.201
THANK YOU FOR DIGGING
SO DEEP, JIM.

14:29.234 --> 14:33.405
I HAVE A SPECIAL CUPCAKE
JUST FOR YOU.

15:05.537 --> 15:08.139
LOOKS DELICIOUS.

15:38.669 --> 15:41.406
(grunts loudly)

15:43.475 --> 15:46.110
ABSOLUTELY SINFUL.

15:46.144 --> 15:47.379
HIT THE SPOT.

15:47.412 --> 15:49.581
MMM! GOOD AS GOLD.

15:51.615 --> 15:53.485
I'M GONNA GO GET
SOME MORE MILK.

15:53.518 --> 15:56.421
WOULD YOU GUYS, UH,
CARE FOR ANYTHING?

15:56.453 --> 15:58.689
UH... NO, NO.

15:58.722 --> 16:00.458
WE'RE GOOD.

16:00.491 --> 16:02.560
WELL, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

16:02.594 --> 16:05.230
JUST GIVE ME A RING.

16:31.556 --> 16:35.360
(lowered voice) OH, THERE--THERE
IS NO WAY HE SWALLOWED IT.

16:35.393 --> 16:37.362
(lowered voice)
WE WERE ALL THERE.

16:37.394 --> 16:39.364
WE ALL SAW HIM SWALLOW IT.

16:39.397 --> 16:42.201
(lowered voice) WELL, THERE'S
ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.019
(beeps)

17:04.422 --> 17:07.392
I-I CAN'T BELIEVE HIM.

17:07.424 --> 17:09.394
HE WOULD RATHER SWALLOW
HIS WEDDING RING

17:09.425 --> 17:11.096
THAN ADMIT HE DID
SOMETHING WRONG.

17:11.127 --> 17:12.563
YOU KNOW WHAT
I CAN'T BELIEVE?

17:12.596 --> 17:14.566
THAT YOU'RE STILL
SURPRISED BY HIM.

17:14.598 --> 17:17.269
HE ONCE TOOK THE KIDS
TO THE CIRCUS,

17:17.300 --> 17:19.303
CAME BACK
WITH A STOLEN MONKEY.

17:19.336 --> 17:22.307
ALL RIGHT. THIS IS NOT OVER.
I DON'T CARE WHAT WE HAVE TO DO,

17:22.339 --> 17:25.309
I AM GONNA HEAR THE WORDS,
"I SWALLOWED MY WEDDING RING,

17:25.343 --> 17:27.579
AND I LIED TO YOU ABOUT IT."

17:27.612 --> 17:30.115
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.
THE EVIDENCE IS GONE.

17:30.147 --> 17:33.284
WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY <i> GONE. </i>
WE...

17:33.317 --> 17:35.287
WE KNOW WHERE IT IS.

17:35.319 --> 17:36.454
RIGHT.

17:36.488 --> 17:40.793
AND PRESUMABLY,
IT'S COMING BACK.

17:43.361 --> 17:45.464
AND WHEN IT DOES...

17:45.497 --> 17:47.365
WE'LL BE THERE.

17:47.397 --> 17:51.202
(both) OHH!

17:56.374 --> 17:57.808
(grunts)

17:57.842 --> 18:00.679
DADDY, I FINISHED THAT REPORT
YOU WANTED ME TO WRITE.

18:00.711 --> 18:03.882
(strained voice) NOT RIGHT NOW,
HONEY. I'M IN A BIT OF A HURRY.

18:03.914 --> 18:06.884
OKAY, BUT IT TAKES FOOD ABOUT
14 HOURS TO PASS THROUGH YOU.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.886
ACTUALLY,
IT TAKES ABOUT 12 HOURS

18:08.920 --> 18:11.656
AND 25 MINUTES
AND 40 SECONDS.

18:11.689 --> 18:13.692
I CAN USE SOME READING.

18:15.292 --> 18:18.296
(grunts)

18:19.931 --> 18:21.567
OH. OHH.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.403
OHH.

18:25.435 --> 18:27.304
(exhaling deeply)

18:27.337 --> 18:28.539
(clink)

18:28.573 --> 18:30.275
OHH!

18:30.307 --> 18:33.511
OHH. OH.

18:33.545 --> 18:35.380
(grunts)

18:35.413 --> 18:37.214
WHAT THE...

18:37.248 --> 18:40.218
DON'T YOU DARE
FLUSH THAT TOILET.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.355
BUT FEEL FREE
TO LIGHT A MATCH.

18:46.590 --> 18:51.328
I THINK WE'VE CROSSED
A LINE IN THIS FAMILY.

18:51.362 --> 18:53.398
I FEEL TOTALLY INVADED.

18:53.431 --> 18:55.432
YEAH, I DON'T FEEL
SO GOOD MYSELF.

18:55.465 --> 18:57.334
IT WAS ALL CHERYL.

18:57.367 --> 19:00.871
ALL SHE COULD TALK ABOUT
WAS CATCHING YOU ON THE POT.

19:00.904 --> 19:04.442
OH, PLEASE. I HAD TO TALK YOU
OUT OF BRINGING A CAMERA.

19:06.376 --> 19:08.646
I FEEL TOTALLY UNCOMFORTABLE
IN THE ROLE

19:08.680 --> 19:10.815
OF THIS FAMILY'S MORAL COMPASS.

19:10.847 --> 19:12.951
OH, GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE.

19:12.983 --> 19:15.287
WERE YOU USING THAT COMPASS
WHEN YOU LOST YOUR WEDDING RING

19:15.319 --> 19:17.888
CATAPULTING WATER BALLOONS
AT YOUR NEIGHBORS?

19:17.922 --> 19:20.192
OR LYING ABOUT IT
FOR A YEAR?

19:20.224 --> 19:23.694
RIDICULING A MAN'S HOBBY
AND SQUIRTING HIM WITH A HOSE?

19:23.728 --> 19:26.431
YOU GUYS PUT A RING
IN A CUPCAKE,

19:26.463 --> 19:29.333
THEN STOOD IN A BATHTUB
AND AMBUSHED ME

19:29.366 --> 19:31.368
LIKE A BUNCH OF HYENAS
WAITING FOR A LION

19:31.402 --> 19:33.904
TO <i> SQUEEZE</i> OUT A RING.

19:33.938 --> 19:37.342
I GAVE YOU THAT RING
ON OUR WEDDING DAY

19:37.375 --> 19:39.344
AS A SYMBOL OF OUR LOVE,

19:39.376 --> 19:41.378
AND YOU LIED TO ME
ABOUT LOSING IT!

19:41.412 --> 19:44.216
I DIDN'T LIE.
I JUST CHOSE NOT TO TELL YOU.

19:44.249 --> 19:47.919
AHA! I TOLD YOU HE'D SAY THAT.
I TOTALLY WIN...

19:47.951 --> 19:51.623
EXCEPT FOR THE PART
ABOUT SEEING JIM POOP.

19:51.655 --> 19:55.659
CHERYL, I CHOSE NOT TO TELL YOU
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU'D GET UPSET.

19:55.692 --> 19:58.430
OH, YOU JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO GET YELLED AT.

19:58.462 --> 20:00.965
THAT IS TRUE. I MEAN,
THE WAY YOU LOOKED THAT DAY,

20:00.999 --> 20:03.999
WITH YOUR HAIR,
YOU LOOKED CRAZY.

20:03.034 --> 20:04.869
UNTIL FIVE MINUTES AGO,

20:04.902 --> 20:06.871
THAT WAS THE WORST THING
I'D EVER SEEN.

20:06.903 --> 20:09.740
CHERYL, THINK ABOUT IT,
ALL RIGHT?

20:09.773 --> 20:11.742
I MEAN,
YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE

20:11.776 --> 20:13.644
THAT I WAS WEARING
A DIFFERENT RING.

20:13.678 --> 20:16.014
AND DO YOU LOVE ME
ANY LESS RIGHT NOW?

20:16.047 --> 20:17.315
A LITTLE.

20:17.347 --> 20:20.484
I FEEL TERRIBLE
THAT I LOST THE RING.

20:20.518 --> 20:23.288
I DO.
BUT COME ON, CHERYL,

20:23.320 --> 20:25.423
WE GOT GREAT LOVE HERE.

20:25.455 --> 20:28.325
WE GOT GREAT COMMITMENT
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

20:28.358 --> 20:30.528
WE DON'T NEED
A SYMBOL TO PROVE IT.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.364
I MEAN, I DON'T,

20:32.396 --> 20:34.465
AND IF YOU DO, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.605
(toilet flushes)

20:42.073 --> 20:44.976
KYLE, WHAT DID YOU DO?

20:45.009 --> 20:47.812
YOU ALWAYS TELL ME TO FLUSH.
I FLUSHED.

20:47.845 --> 20:50.515
WHY DON'T YOU TELL <i> HIM?</i>

20:53.351 --> 20:55.287
(both sighs)

20:55.319 --> 20:57.990
WELL, CHERYL,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU...

20:59.757 --> 21:01.759
I GOT IT THIS MORNING.

21:04.494 --> 21:07.765
WHAT?
BUT... WE HEARD THE CLINK.

21:07.798 --> 21:10.269
YEAH, IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.

21:14.338 --> 21:17.608
REMIND ME TOMORROW--
WE GOTTA HAVE SOME KEYS MADE.
