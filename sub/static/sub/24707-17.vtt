00:18.600 --> 00:21.300
- Got him, huh?
- Yeah.

00:21.100 --> 00:24.200
- How long could he last in there?
- Oh, about eight to 10 hours.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.400
- Huh.
- This blowfish can inflate five times his present size.

00:27.400 --> 00:31.400
- Huh.
- Yeah. He can threaten an enemy, uh, impress a female blowfish.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.500
What's up?

00:34.500 --> 00:36.700
- Black guy on the phone over there?
- Trouble?

00:36.700 --> 00:38.600
No. No trouble.
I know him.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.800
Best informant I ever had.
You're gonna like this guy, Andy.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.000
Yeah, I like everybody.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.300
- Ferdinand.
- Hey, Bobby man. Hey, not now.

00:52.300 --> 00:55.200
Not now? I welcome you home,
and you play cold. What's up with that?

00:55.200 --> 00:56.800
Oh, man. Please.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.900
Ferdinand, are you working here?

00:58.800 --> 01:01.600
- Hejust gets out of Attica.
- Comstock.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.300
You don't write.
You don't call.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.600
I come out on the street with my partner
here, and you setting up for business.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.800
Bobby, I didn't even
know you was downtown.

01:08.700 --> 01:11.800
- You checking out this Lexus, huh?
- What? What Lexus? Man, no.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.800
- Just checking the atmosphere.
- You looking to take off Colombians now?

01:14.700 --> 01:18.200
'Cause that's living pretty large.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.600
Damn it! Robert, man, you pop up
like this, you ruin everything.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.500
- Man, a couple more minutes out there, and I'm gone!
- You know how that goes.

01:24.400 --> 01:28.400
First, you pay, and then maybe
you get a chance to play. Come on.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.900
Damn it!

02:46.800 --> 02:49.300
Can I help you?

02:49.300 --> 02:52.300
Ray Kahlins. I'm with
the, uh, HI DA task force.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.200
Which is
Detective Sipowicz's desk?

02:54.100 --> 02:56.200
- Over there.
- Thank you.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.200
I'll file that information.

02:58.100 --> 03:02.200
- How's it going, huh?
- Good. Who you guys all with?

03:02.100 --> 03:06.400
Son, if I tell you that, I gotta kill you. Hmm?

03:11.800 --> 03:14.400
- Yeah?
- Sergeant Ray Kahlins, Lieutenant.

03:14.300 --> 03:17.000
NYPD detail to
the HIDA task force.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.800
I got the memo you'd
be here on the Barnes case.

03:18.900 --> 03:23.300
Two drug crews shoot it out. Only casualty's
a 10-year-old on her way to school, huh?

03:23.200 --> 03:27.400
Yeah. We got two empty rooms you can use
in Anticrime. That's up on the third floor.

03:27.300 --> 03:32.300
- Great.
- I know I owe you a detective. You need any logistical help?

03:32.100 --> 03:34.500
You gotta be kidding.
We're federally funded, Lieutenant.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.300
We got new cars. We got
new radios. Unlimited overtime.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.500
Yeah. State police are
working with you too?

03:39.400 --> 03:43.200
Everyone but the cavalry.
We can't spend it fast enough.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.900
So how you doing
on the case?

03:44.900 --> 03:48.200
W- We're looking at some people.
We're working back on the crews.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.500
- Thanks for the space.
- Yeah.

03:52.300 --> 03:55.100
Hey, Diane?

03:56.300 --> 03:59.200
- Morning, boss.
- Yeah, morning. Um...

03:59.200 --> 04:01.300
We got a High-Intensity Drug Area
unit working out of the squad.

04:01.300 --> 04:05.000
- They're on the Barnes homicide?
- Yeah. It's a different kind of investigative work.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.300
Um, they've got federal money.
They can go a lot farther into a case.

04:08.200 --> 04:11.300
- It might be good experience for you working with them.
- Sure. I'd like that.

04:11.200 --> 04:15.600
The guy running the detail's from our job.
Sergeant Kahlins. Go out and introduce yourself.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.300
- I appreciate the look, Lieutenant.
- Yeah.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.100
Uh-huh.

04:23.100 --> 04:26.000
Excuse me. Young lady, you know
how to spell fornicate"?

04:27.100 --> 04:30.400
Never mind.
I'll just shorten it.

04:32.100 --> 04:35.900
Tread lightly through your thinking for me,
turning this Ferdinand loose.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.200
Andy, we bring him in, I gotta toss him.
I know I'm gonna find a gun.

04:38.100 --> 04:41.000
Perish the thought you take
a weapon off a stickup guy.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.900
He comes in on his own. He's off this piece.
He's not looking at a collar.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.700
- He's gonna have a whole lot better attitude.
- You see those tracks?

04:47.700 --> 04:51.000
- Yeah. He's been shooting up his whole life, coke and dope, both.
- So we know he's reliable.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
He'll show, Andy.
He'll make cases for us.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.100
I'll put the bag in the freshwater tank
till I go home.

04:56.100 --> 04:59.900
This little guy inflates himself,
those goldfish'll have a stroke.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.000
- Yeah, huh?
- Yeah.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.600
Oh, man.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.800
- Who's that?
- Some loudmouth crap-artist.

05:06.900 --> 05:10.500
Hey, Andy. I was just writing you
an obscene note.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.700
How's it going there, Kahlins?
This is Bobby Simone.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.900
- Sergeant Ray Kahlins.
- Good to meet you, Sarge. Diane Russell.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.400
- Hi.
- Hi. How's it going, Diane?

05:18.400 --> 05:20.800
I just got some good news. My boss
wants me to work on your task force.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.000
I knew I liked that guy.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.400
So, Andy,
still closing down the bars?

05:27.600 --> 05:29.600
No. Not too much.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.100
I've only met a few people in my life
could drink me under a table.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.500
And this guy is one of them.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.500
- So this is where you landed, huh?
- Yeah.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.700
- It's not bad. It's not bad for precinct work.
- Andy.

05:44.500 --> 05:48.400
Yeah. Look, I'd stick around for more career
evaluation, but we gotta talk to this guy.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.200
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Nice to meet you.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.600
- Same here.
- Come on. Let's take the long way to the coffee room.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.600
Hey, Diane, body in a basement on Hester
Street. You want to work it with us?

05:56.400 --> 05:58.600
Boss just assigned me to the task force
on the Barnes homicide.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.300
Hey, good for you. That's great.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.800
Yeah. James Martinez, Greg Medavoy,
Sergeant Ray Kahlins.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.600
- How's it going?
- I noticed you got a Ranger jacket on there.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.600
Our Miss Abandando,
big Ranger fan.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.500
Is that so? I won this on a bet.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.800
So you got a stinker
down on Hester Street?

06:12.800 --> 06:15.100
Yeah, yeah. We don't know
how long it's been there.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.300
Yeah. You know, I used to own a couple
of them loft buildings over there by Ludlow.

06:18.300 --> 06:22.000
Zoning regs wouldn't let me
develop them the way I wanted to.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
So I said, 'The hell with this. "I sold
the two of them off, cleared myself 80 large.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.300
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.500
Anyways, we better
get over there.

06:28.500 --> 06:33.600
Diane, think you could point me in the general
direction of the, uh, Anti-Crime section?

06:33.400 --> 06:37.200
- It's right upstairs.
- Okay. Guys, let's go. We're moving out.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.900
- When'd you own those lofts?
- Well, I sold them about five years ago.

06:39.900 --> 06:44.100
Made myself somewheres
between $80,000, $90,000.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.700
Watching you drink coffee
makes my teeth hurt.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.400
I'm a fiend for sweets.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.400
Dope, cocaine, sweets.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.700
All I want is everything.

07:05.700 --> 07:08.800
Say, Ferdinand, whatever happened to
that tall guy you used to hunt with?

07:08.700 --> 07:11.200
Antoine? He dead.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.700
Got the virus.
Went real quick.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.000
A lot of guys
have got that bug now, man.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.400
Yeah. A lot of guys do.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.600
So what do you got
for show and tell?

07:24.500 --> 07:27.700
- Rent's due, huh?
- First of the month, holmes.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.000
How about I put two bodies
on Marcus Edmonds?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.100
I mean he dead now.
So he's past minding.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.700
You're gonna give us paper clearances
off Marcus Edmonds?

07:37.700 --> 07:41.800
Guy's been dead for four months. Every snitch
in the city's still trying to put murders on him.

07:41.700 --> 07:44.900
Marcus like to shot about 20 people
'fore he caught a bullet his own self.

07:44.900 --> 07:48.800
I'm gonna tell you about
that double, LaGuardia Homes.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.400
Them bodies in the stairwell.

07:52.400 --> 07:56.500
- Edmonds did those shootings?
- Sure did. I got names, numbers.

07:56.300 --> 08:00.700
I know who was with him. I know
the whole story behind that foolishness.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.400
All right. All right.
We'll get back to that.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.200
How about something fresh?

08:08.200 --> 08:10.900
How about that bodega last month, Avenue B,"
where the counter man got shot?

08:10.800 --> 08:13.400
- How about it?
- Fresh enough?

08:13.400 --> 08:16.800
- Let's hear it.
- Shooter was Lynwood Truett.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.700
Used to be with
the Diamond in the Raw Crew.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.600
They cut him loose when
he kept messing up the count.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.400
Second man in that job
was Andre Boyd.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.500
He been on Rikers last couple of weeks.
You need a witness? You got Marletta Weeks.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.900
She Boyd's girlfriend.
She drove 'em there.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.200
- Where's this Marletta live?
- Alphabet City somewheres.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
You'll find her through Social Services.
She get a check.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.700
Can I get back
to my own little drama now?

08:39.500 --> 08:41.799
Who were those Colombians
you were looking to take off?

08:44.100 --> 08:46.900
- Man, they're my business.
- Your business?

08:46.900 --> 08:49.800
Damn straight. You got your own business.
I'm helping you with that.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.700
But I got my own thing,
and you messing with it.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.600
I tend to mess
with armed robbery. Yeah.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.600
Bobby, man,
chill your partner down.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.600
No. I got a vision of
a street full of taxpayers...

08:57.600 --> 09:00.300
getting caught in
the cross fire, Ferdinand...

09:00.300 --> 09:02.200
while you do business
with your.38.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.600
.44.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.400
My mistake.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.900
Niggers see that big gun come out,
they don't argue.

09:09.900 --> 09:12.700
They looking down that big-ass barrel
like it's the Lincoln Tunnel...

09:12.700 --> 09:14.600
and theyJersey bound.

09:14.600 --> 09:18.400
Man, they give it up.
Wail like bitches.

09:18.300 --> 09:21.200
Only fools stop
and trifle with a.44.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I need your beeper number,
Ferdinand.

09:25.900 --> 09:27.800
Yeah, okay.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.500
Then you can take off
while we check out your stuff.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.400
Can't even
write my numbers good.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.800
I should've stayed in school.

09:56.300 --> 09:59.200
This guy's stabbed up pretty good.
But there's no decomp.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.900
- Actually, he looks pretty fresh.
- Yeah.

10:01.900 --> 10:04.600
It's the rest of the room
that stinks like death.

10:04.500 --> 10:08.200
Santeria-
offering to the saints.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.100
- Huh?
- Our guy's a santero, a priest.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.300
See?
He's wearing all white.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.500
They do that for the first two years
for purity.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.200
This is where
he must've made his offerings.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.200
No pockets on this outfit.
I don't see no I.D.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.500
Look at this.
Goats, roosters...

10:25.500 --> 10:29.200
The santero sacrifices to
the ancient gods and Catholic saints.

10:29.100 --> 10:33.800
He uses them for white magic. No black
magic though. That's Palo Mayombe.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.700
You know all about this stuff.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.400
Yeah. Tio Pepe, my uncle,
was a santero.

10:38.400 --> 10:42.700
On Sundays, you couldn't go into my cousin's
basement without stepping on a rooster's head.

10:42.600 --> 10:47.200
People from the neighborhood would come to
my Tio Pepe to put a trabajito on their enemies.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.800
- What's a trabajito?
- That's like a little work, like a hex.

10:49.700 --> 10:52.600
Well, h-how are
we gonna I.D. This guy?

10:52.600 --> 10:55.500
I'll call Father Ramos
over at Saint Luis's.

10:55.500 --> 10:59.800
- You'd call a Catholic priest ab-about a
witch doctor? - They're not witch doctors, Greg.

10:59.700 --> 11:03.000
Spanish neighborhoods, Catholic priests
tend to deal with these guys a little.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.200
Yeah? Live and learn.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.900
Life's not all
Ozzie and Harriet.

11:07.900 --> 11:13.500
Yeah. This is definitely not
the Nelson family rec room.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.700
Morrisey and Regina caught that bodega
homicide your C.I. Told you about.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.300
They're coming in on a 41.

11:22.300 --> 11:25.300
We can check out this woman, Marletta,
who supposedly drove the getaway car.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.500
Turn her over
to Morrisey when he gets in.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.300
Information the C.I. Gave up on those
LaGuardia Homes homicides checks out.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.200
Putting those on Marcus Edmonds.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.300
Guy's information is straight,
Lieu. It always has been.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.600
- So, you gonna need anything
from the snitch fund? - No. Uh-uh.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.700
Is he up on a charge?

11:38.700 --> 11:41.700
- He just got out. Did a three-year bit.
- So what do you got over him?

11:41.700 --> 11:44.900
He's probably doing some things that
we don't want to know about.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.700
Give me a hint.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.200
The bit was just
sticking up drug dealers.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.100
He's been doing his act longer
than I've been on thejob, Lieu.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.500
And I have never once heard
of a civilian getting hurt.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.900
I don't want this guy thinking
he's got a free ride in my precinct.

11:57.900 --> 12:00.800
- He knows it's not like that.
- Mm-hmm.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.600
- Meanwhile we get these clearances.
- Clearances are great.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.500
You figure this Ferdinand
for having a virus like his tall friend, Antoine?

12:13.400 --> 12:16.700
- Yeah. That's how I read it.
- When you saw this guy was looking...

12:16.600 --> 12:19.300
to take off a Colombian,
you said he was stepping up.

12:19.300 --> 12:21.600
Mm-hmm.
He used to hit independents.

12:21.600 --> 12:26.000
A lot of people will figure taking off
a Cali bagman an assisted form of suicide.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.300
You thinking 'cause maybe he's got the virus,
he's, uh, taking more chances.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.300
He wants to risk getting his head
blown off, that's his problem.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.500
But he may not be as careful
with civilians as he used to be either.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.400
I don't figure him like that, Andy.

12:37.300 --> 12:40.000
- It may be worth a conversation.
- Detective squad. One moment.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.400
Welfare's on line two
about a Marletta Weeks.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.100
Ah.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
- Hey.
- How's it going?

12:48.100 --> 12:51.600
Good. So you're detailed
to that HI DA unit, huh?

12:51.400 --> 12:54.100
- Yeah.
- Gonna get you some profile.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.900
That Marletta picks up her welfare check
at a post office box.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.800
We'll get the address
from the postal inspector.

13:04.900 --> 13:08.100
Yeah. You got detail on
that Barnes investigation, huh?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.600
You work with my boss before?

13:09.700 --> 13:12.800
Kahlins, yeah. Don't forget
your hip boots tomorrow.

13:13.900 --> 13:17.300
- Sylvia.
- Hi.

13:17.200 --> 13:21.100
Some affidavit information
for some warrants from a Sergeant Kahlins?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.400
- Um. He's upstairs.
- Okay.

13:24.400 --> 13:28.100
- He can come down here. You don't have to go climbing up.
- I'll go get him.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.900
- What you getting warrants for?
- We're going out on a couple houses tomorrow.

13:31.900 --> 13:34.800
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.900
Excuse me.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.800
Has to go to the bathroom
all the time now.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.500
I didn't figure that task force
would be going through any doors.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.600
- Excuse me. Um-
- May I help you?

13:56.500 --> 13:59.000
- Father Ramos.
- Yes?

13:58.900 --> 14:00.900
I'm Detective Martinez.
Thanks for coming in.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.400
You spoke on the phone about a santero
found murdered on Hester Street.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.900
- This is Detective Medavoy.
- Hi.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.900
Yeah.

14:09.900 --> 14:12.700
This is from
the medical examiner's office.

14:12.600 --> 14:15.800
So, I'm sure he, uh-
I'm sure he's looked better to you.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.000
It's Miguel. Miguel Marquez.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.900
- Do you know who stabbed him?
- Well, we're looking into it now.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.900
Father, as a santero, uh,
was this man well regarded?

14:25.800 --> 14:29.300
Well, I can't recall anything ill
being said about Mr. Marquez.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.400
He practiced
the white magic only.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.900
Naturally, we discourage
the practice completely.

14:33.900 --> 14:37.800
Would you know of an address
for Mr. Marquez? Uh, next of kin?

14:37.800 --> 14:40.500
Yes. It should be in our church records.
M- May I use your phone?

14:40.400 --> 14:43.600
Just dial nine, Father.

14:47.200 --> 14:51.100
So, Detective Russell tells me, uh,
that you're Andy Sipowicz's better half.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.100
That's right.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.100
- Andy and me have gone through some doors in this job.
- Is that so?

14:57.100 --> 15:00.800
- We were in service together at the same time too.
- Vietnam?

15:00.700 --> 15:03.300
Yes, ma'am.
During the worst of it.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.600
All right.
Basis for application?

15:06.500 --> 15:10.200
Confidential information and
proceeds of surveillance.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.500
State criminal enterprise
you believe is being conducted.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.900
Sale and
warehouse of drugs.

15:14.900 --> 15:17.400
We are gonna get
a title three out of this.

15:17.400 --> 15:20.100
- That is six months, minimum.
- Title three's a wiretap?

15:20.100 --> 15:24.800
You get a wire up,
and the overtime really starts to flow.

15:24.600 --> 15:28.200
If you think that these warrants aren't
going to be productive, Sergeant...

15:28.200 --> 15:31.000
I have much better things
to do with my time.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.800
Well, no, no. The warrants
are definitely gonna be productive.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.600
So, I'm just looking ahead.

15:36.600 --> 15:40.500
I'm, uh, letting Detective Russell here
know what the next step would be.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.300
I'm reeducating her
from precinct work.

15:42.300 --> 15:47.200
See, now, federal time,
everything stretches out.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
They say it's like that
in Hawaii.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.900
Yes, this is my son.

16:02.900 --> 16:05.500
I'm very sorry for your loss.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.300
Did your son recently have
an argument with anyone, Mrs. Marquez?

16:08.300 --> 16:11.100
- Have anyone angry with him?
- No one was angry with my son.

16:10.900 --> 16:15.300
Unless... those who deal
with dark magic.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.300
Those who call the saints for evil.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.300
Paio Mayombay," huh?

16:19.300 --> 16:21.700
What do you know
about Palo Mayombe?

16:21.700 --> 16:24.100
No. L-I-I just heard the term.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Can we take a look around
at some of Miguel's things?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.500
Ta bien.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.200
Ew.

16:49.200 --> 16:53.600
Ahh, a caldero- ceremonial pot
where the magic happens.

16:53.400 --> 16:57.200
And the prendas-
the deer horns to bring the saints.

16:57.100 --> 17:01.700
- Look at this. Come here.
- What?

17:01.700 --> 17:04.400
Rudolph Haysbert.

17:04.300 --> 17:07.599
New York Division of Parole
and Probation, Manhattan Office.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.500
- A business card?
- With a date and time written on the back.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.700
See? They put something
in the caldero...

17:12.700 --> 17:15.000
which belongs to the person
they're gonna put the spell on.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.099
Mm-hmm. Maybe Miguel became a santero
after a little stay in the joint.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.599
Unless he's hexing
this Haysbert for a client.

17:25.300 --> 17:29.400
Mrs. Marquez, by any chance
was Miguel on parole?

17:29.200 --> 17:31.900
Why do you ask me
such a question?

17:31.800 --> 17:33.700
I told you Miguel was a healer.

17:33.700 --> 17:37.400
Had he ever been arrested? Did he have
an appointment with a parole officer?

17:37.400 --> 17:40.300
#Un hombre de Dios?
A man of God!

17:40.300 --> 17:42.500
- But-
- She's saying no, Greg.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.800
Okay. Yeah. Fine.
We'rejust inquiring.

17:56.800 --> 18:01.600
I gotta reach out to this C.I. Tomorrow. Make
sure he's not on some kind of kamikaze run.

18:01.400 --> 18:04.200
- How are you doing?
- Why don't you have a glass of wine?

18:04.100 --> 18:07.600
- No. I'm good.
- I'm trying to get you loose.

18:07.500 --> 18:11.100
- Loose?
- Yeah.

18:10.900 --> 18:14.400
You look like someone who needs
to be taken advantage of.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.300
Ahh, you're just pretty happy
about this new assignment.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.500
I'm glad Fancy likes my work.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.500
I don't know how much
I'm gonna learn from this Kahlins.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.200
- Andy sure doesn't like him.
- He's kind of a blowhard.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.500
He doesn't like to get off
his ass too much either.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.600
If we don't get something off these warrants
tomorrow, he wants to go to wiretaps.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.300
Wiretaps? I don't figure that's how
you're gonna collar up on a street crew.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.600
You're being so good.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.100
You mean with you busting into
a roomful of bad guys tomorrow...

18:42.100 --> 18:44.900
backed by a boss who doesn't want to
be in the building in the first place?

18:44.700 --> 18:47.000
You mean not letting myself
get all crazy behind that?

18:47.000 --> 18:51.400
- Pretty much sums it up.
- Yeah, well. Heck, it's your world, Diane.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.800
I'm just trying to keep
my little place in it nice and tidy.

18:54.700 --> 18:58.300
Mmm. See, that gets me hot.

18:58.300 --> 19:01.200
- Mmm?
- You being so evolved.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.900
Well, guess I'm out of luck
'cause here comes the waiter.

19:04.900 --> 19:08.000
Don't give up so easy.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.800
- Hey. Hi.
- Good evening.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.600
- Thanks.
- Can I tell you the specials?

19:11.600 --> 19:14.100
Uh. Yeah.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.200
For appetizers, we have polenta prepared
with a special-a shiitake mushroom sauce.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.200
Whoa!

19:20.200 --> 19:22.900
- Am I going too fast?
- Too fast?

19:22.900 --> 19:27.300
No, you're good.
Go ahead.

19:27.100 --> 19:30.500
A polenta prepared with a special-
a shiitake mushroom sauce.

19:30.500 --> 19:34.500
- Main course, osso buco.
- Mmm.

20:05.700 --> 20:09.400
Police! Get down! Get down!
Get down!

20:11.200 --> 20:14.200
- Freeze! Cuff'im!
- You got him?

20:14.200 --> 20:17.300
- Yo, man. Relax. - I got
him. - Get down on your knees.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.500
Lighten up. Lighten up.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.000
- Let me see your hands.
- All clear!

20:23.000 --> 20:26.600
- Let's toss this place.
- Yeah, go ahead. Toss everything.

20:28.200 --> 20:32.500
Take a look in there.
Check those cabinets. There.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.600
Yeah. I understand
that the clinic's roster is confidential.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.100
No, look. If we didn't believe that
people could be in danger from this guy...

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
we wouldn't be asking, okay?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.600
- Lynwood Truett. Right.
- This is Detective Morrisey.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.700
We wouldn't be asking for
confidential information...

20:51.700 --> 20:54.000
except this guy's wanted
in a murder investigation.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.500
We picked Truett's girlfriend up last night,
a, uh, Marletta Weeks.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.600
- Said he registered into a methadone program?
- Okay. Thank you.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.400
Without breaching
confidentiality...

21:03.500 --> 21:06.000
could you indicate if I came
looking for him at your 300 pickup...

21:06.000 --> 21:08.400
would that be a waste of time?

21:08.400 --> 21:09.800
Uh-huh.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.100
- How'd you do?
- Looked to me like we zeroed out.

21:12.100 --> 21:15.100
But I'm just
a ignorant trooper.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.400
Knocked the hell
out of some doors though.

21:17.300 --> 21:19.600
I knew this was gonna
have to go to a wiretap.

21:19.500 --> 21:22.600
- We are gonna be working this in the summer.
- Yeah. I'll go look for a fan.

21:22.600 --> 21:27.600
Well, that or you can kiss my ass.

21:27.500 --> 21:31.000
Why, the criminal justice system
is a rusting old machine...

21:30.900 --> 21:33.600
and overtime pay is
a necessary lubricant.

21:33.500 --> 21:38.200
- Am I right, Andy?
- Detective Sipowicz, 15th Squad.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.500
We're looking at someone for a homicide
we think might get medicine at your clinic.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.800
Name of Lynwood Truett.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.700
Three up, three down, huh?

21:48.700 --> 21:50.800
Yeah. We were an easy inning.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.600
On one of the places,
he wasn't all wrong.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.400
It's supposed to be this Marvin Freeland's
stash. The people we want were there.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.000
- They just weren't holding.
- So, you just keep looking.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
You gonna get evolved
on me again?

22:00.900 --> 22:03.800
'Cause I'll jump you right here.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.900
Um, uh,
Detective, um...

22:05.900 --> 22:09.000
that, uh, black fellow
with the sweatshirt and sunglasses.

22:08.900 --> 22:11.900
Okay, Donna. Thanks.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.200
We're out here.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.400
- That's your C. I?
- My partner's.

22:27.300 --> 22:31.100
- What's his name?
- Goose Tatum.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.300
Can't blame a guy for trying.

22:39.500 --> 22:43.000
Robert, you starting to
remind me of my cousin, Darnell.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.200
Oh, yeah? How's that?

22:45.100 --> 22:47.100
Darnell, he a country boy.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.400
He used to come from Carolina,
spend the summer in the big city.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.600
At first it was good
to see him, you know?

22:51.500 --> 22:54.100
ByJuly, he got to acting
all crazy, jumping bad.

22:54.100 --> 22:56.700
It be like, Yo, coz.
You done wore the welcome out."

23:01.600 --> 23:03.500
I gotta ask you something,
Ferdinand.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.200
You got that virus?

23:08.200 --> 23:12.600
- Got caught up in that, yeah.
- Sorry.

23:12.600 --> 23:16.100
I guess it ain't like I don't deserve it.
All these years of running and gunning.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.100
I finally got tested up at Comstock.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.700
Felt like I knew the answer
before they told me.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.800
This takeoff with the Colombians
that you're working on...

23:23.700 --> 23:26.100
you running
a little wild with that?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.900
- What you mean?
- You know what I mean.

23:27.900 --> 23:30.200
Are you getting reckless?

23:30.100 --> 23:33.900
You think I'm looking
to go out in a blaze of glory?

23:33.900 --> 23:36.800
No, man. I don't want
to get thin and all.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.100
But that happens, I carry it.

23:39.100 --> 23:42.900
- You a soldier, huh?
- I'm a Viking, holmes.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.500
You know about this drug crew
that stashes over on Rivington?

23:48.500 --> 23:52.400
Main name I got is
some gangster named Freeland.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.600
This more rent?

23:56.500 --> 23:58.700
Favor.

24:03.300 --> 24:08.500
Marvin Freeland.
He's only half gangster.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.900
The other half all punk.
I hit his stash twice this year.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.800
We think Freeland's crew
is part of the cross fire...

24:13.900 --> 24:16.800
that killed this 10-year-old girl
on Canal Street last month.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.700
Yeah. I seen it on the news.

24:19.700 --> 24:24.000
Back in the day, a player walk up,
put the gun to the back of the guy's head.

24:23.900 --> 24:26.400
Make sure he hit the right nigger.

24:26.300 --> 24:30.700
Now you got fools, 15 to a clip, semi-autos,
spraying a whole damn street.

24:30.700 --> 24:34.900
- You think you might talk to someone about this Freeland?
- Someone?

24:34.700 --> 24:36.700
Another cop.
Just give him some background.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.400
Robert, don't make me out a bitch.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.900
Ferdinand, I would relay it,
but you're not registered as a C.I.

24:41.700 --> 24:44.400
And this guy, he looks
for reasons not to do his job.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.700
Dead girl his case?

24:48.300 --> 24:50.300
Yeah, okay.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.900
Appreciate it, Ferdinand.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.800
Fish guy gonna come?

24:55.700 --> 24:59.200
- You all right with that?
- Yeah.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.900
Hey, Robert, do I look
like that Unabomber?

25:11.300 --> 25:13.800
I'm, uh, Parole Officer
Rudy Haysbert.

25:13.700 --> 25:17.000
Oh, I'm Greg Medavoy.
Come on in.

25:16.900 --> 25:19.300
- Appreciate you coming down.
- I assume one of my cases went south?

25:19.300 --> 25:22.400
- Andy.
- We'll talk over here.

25:22.400 --> 25:25.200
- Oh, uh, my partner, James Martinez.
- How's it going?

25:25.100 --> 25:26.600
This is
Parole Officer Haysbert.

25:26.600 --> 25:29.500
If you'd told me which one of
my parolees you were interested in...

25:29.500 --> 25:31.500
we could've done
this whole thing on the phone.

25:31.500 --> 25:37.400
Well, actually, Mr. Haysbert, your card was
found in the possession of a homicide victim.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.800
- A, uh, Miguel Marquez?
- Was he a client?

25:43.100 --> 25:47.500
- You don't know offhand?
- Offhand? I got a caseload of about 450 people.

25:47.400 --> 25:52.300
Marquez. Marquez.

25:52.100 --> 25:55.900
I got a Marguerite.
No Miguel.

25:55.900 --> 25:59.000
Well, that matches anyway.
We got no arrest record for the guy.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.600
On the back of your card,
it says, uh, March 14, 9:00 a.m."

26:03.500 --> 26:06.300
March 14.

26:11.300 --> 26:16.000
March 14. Yeah.
900 slot. Gabriel Mota.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.500
- He didn't post.
- And?

26:18.500 --> 26:20.100
And I violated him.
It was his fourth no-show.

26:20.100 --> 26:23.000
If you find this guy, let me know.
I'll flag a detainer.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
You got an address?

26:25.900 --> 26:28.800
If I can find the file,
I got an address.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.600
- Hey, Ray.
- Hey, Andy. You in the market, Andy?

26:38.500 --> 26:40.300
No.

26:40.300 --> 26:43.400
I am ashamed to tell you how much money
I've made the last two years.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.400
Congratulations. We got a guy here with
background about the crew you're looking at.

26:46.400 --> 26:49.100
Oh, yeah? Is he registered?

26:49.100 --> 26:51.700
No, he's not registered. But
he's robbed your people twice.

26:51.700 --> 26:53.300
We got our own informants.

26:53.300 --> 26:56.300
We don't need to be dragging
everybody in the precinct into this case.

26:56.300 --> 27:00.300
- This guy's got information.
- You mean your guy, huh?

27:00.200 --> 27:02.800
Is it about turf, Ray? You thinkin'
we want a piece of your case?

27:02.700 --> 27:06.300
Anything your guy
can tell me, I already know.

27:06.300 --> 27:09.100
So you going after Ronnie Mo.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
- Who?
- Ronnie Mo.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.800
- You mean Ronald Carter?
Yes. He is one of our people.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.300
You put a charge on Ronnie Mo,
you one hell of a police.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.500
- I do my job.
- 'Cause he been dead about six months.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.700
- Got killed up in the Bronx somewheres.
- That's crap!

27:25.700 --> 27:28.900
Look, man. You going after Marvin
Freeland's crew, I'm here to tell you...

27:28.800 --> 27:32.000
Black Larry is the weak link.
He runs Freeland's stash house.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.600
And he's backing up
10-year federal parole.

27:34.500 --> 27:39.900
You put a charge on Larry-
He be steady talking.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.100
We hit Larry's place
this morning. Came up empty.

27:42.100 --> 27:44.600
Every time I hit Larry,
there plenty of dope and 'caine.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.500
Front part of his door
hollowed out.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.300
- Are they still doing repairs on that last address?
- Yeah.

27:54.200 --> 27:58.700
Well, if he is stashed there,
he couldn't have moved it.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.400
We're gonna go back there,
see how good your information is.

28:04.300 --> 28:07.800
- And I'll put it together.
- Better not be wasting my time.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.700
Yeah, you'd hate for that
to happen, huh, Sarge?

28:09.700 --> 28:12.900
- Screw you, Simone.
- Sarge, call for you.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.800
Well, if you're right, Ferdinand,
you're gonna make my week.

28:16.800 --> 28:19.800
It'll be right. People tell you straight
they got that big.44 in their mouth.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.300
- This be it for a while, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.100
Else you'll be heating me up.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.600
- Take care of yourself on the street.
- Be all right.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.700
Still got some veins up.
Still like my sweets.

28:46.900 --> 28:49.800
We were about done when you radioed.
Been stalling a half hour.

28:49.800 --> 28:52.800
- Is that the original door?
- Yeah.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.800
- Get this off of here.
- What's going on?

28:57.800 --> 29:00.200
Shut up.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.400
Ho.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.700
Know anything
about this, Larry?

29:18.700 --> 29:21.100
- Mm-mmm.
- Mm-mmm.

29:21.100 --> 29:23.500
Let's take a ride anyway.

29:24.400 --> 29:28.900
Come on.
Let me see those hands again.

29:40.700 --> 29:43.300
I recognize this one.
His name is Gabriel Mota.

29:44.500 --> 29:47.600
He came last month to my son,
Miguel, for un trabajo.

29:47.500 --> 29:50.400
And what did they want
the trabajo to do for him?

29:50.400 --> 29:53.400
- To make him invisible.
- Invisible?

29:53.300 --> 29:57.000
- Si. He wanted not to be seen.
- For what reason?

29:56.900 --> 30:00.200
For the police not
to be able to see him.

30:00.200 --> 30:04.200
And, uh, your son made
un trabayo" for Gabriel Mota.

30:04.100 --> 30:06.800
Yes. He made this man
invisible. Si.

30:06.700 --> 30:12.300
Then he came back very angry because
the police had stopped him in his car...

30:12.200 --> 30:14.500
because his license plates were...

30:14.400 --> 30:17.100
How do you say?
Were exploded."

30:17.000 --> 30:21.400
- They expired?
- Yes. He said, 'How can the police see him?"

30:21.300 --> 30:26.500
- And what did your son say?
- Well, he explained that un trabajo doesn't last forever.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.100
You have to keep coming back.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.800
And how did this man
take the explanation?

30:30.800 --> 30:33.600
He doesn't stop being angry.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.100
So my son said, Then go find
yourself somebody else."

30:36.000 --> 30:39.900
Mrs. Marquez, uh, the way
you looked at these photographs...

30:39.800 --> 30:41.700
could you do the same
with a group of men?

30:41.800 --> 30:45.600
- Try to I.D. This Gabriel Mota?
- Yes, all right.

30:45.500 --> 30:48.700
- See, we'll bring him into the station house.
- Mm-hmm.

30:48.700 --> 30:51.900
Assuming he's visible to the officers
that go looking for him.

30:53.200 --> 30:56.600
This man's federal, Larry.
I'm NYPD.

30:56.600 --> 31:00.200
Reason I'm talking to you is 'cause even
with all that weight we found in your door...

31:00.100 --> 31:02.100
you could still keep this
in state court.

31:02.100 --> 31:05.400
- That means no mandatory minimums.
- State court's Rockefeller Law.

31:05.400 --> 31:10.200
Last month a 10-year-old girl named Janelle
Barnes got caught in a cross fire on Canal Street.

31:10.100 --> 31:13.400
Give up the right answers
in her homicide...

31:13.400 --> 31:15.400
maybe it's not clear the stash
was in your possession.

31:15.400 --> 31:18.600
Then Rockefeller
wouldn't apply.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.500
I need to hear a D.A. Say it.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.400
You got the right answers
on the Barnes homicide?

31:22.300 --> 31:24.600
Yeah. I could give you those.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.700
I'll get a D.A.

31:28.700 --> 31:31.700
If somebody robs you
a few times, Larry...

31:31.600 --> 31:35.900
you might want to figure
a new place to keep your drugs.

31:35.900 --> 31:38.800
Scumbag!

31:44.600 --> 31:47.600
- Why did you do that, Kahlins?
- I'll find the D.A.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.800
- Do what? I don't know what you're talking about.
- Do what?

31:49.800 --> 31:52.500
You just gave my C.I.
To that asshole in that room in there.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.700
- What do you need?
- We're from the 27.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.900
Detective Martinez and Medavoy wanted
this guy picked up for an interview.

31:57.800 --> 32:01.100
Yeah. Interview 3 down the hall there.
Martinez and Medavoy are in the squad.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.900
- Thanks.
- I'll get 'em.

32:02.900 --> 32:05.400
Oh, don't let me hit this guy.

32:05.400 --> 32:10.900
You told this Black Larry it was off him getting
robbed we knew where to look for his stash.

32:10.800 --> 32:13.500
She's downstairs taking a statement.
She'll be up in about 20 minutes.

32:13.500 --> 32:18.100
So Simone's guy does us a favor.
Huh? He goes out of his way.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.300
Now, the thanks he's gonna get the first time
this Larry gets a message to a visitor...

32:23.100 --> 32:26.000
Simone's guy
is gonna get whacked.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.900
You see my problem yet, Ray?
You understand what my problem is now?

32:28.800 --> 32:30.800
Boy, you guys
get thick with your C.I.'s.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.800
This is an unregistered informant.
A stickup man.

32:34.700 --> 32:36.900
He puts guns to people's heads.

32:36.900 --> 32:40.600
Excuse me, but I'm not worried whether
this guy makes it to his retirement party.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.100
Let me know
when the D.A. Gets here.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.900
You and your partner ought to hang around
in case this D.O.A.'s mother...

33:01.700 --> 33:03.500
don't pick this Gabriel Mota out.

33:03.600 --> 33:07.000
- No problem.
- Hey, uh, did this guy indicate...

33:06.900 --> 33:08.900
to you at all that
he thought he was invisible?

33:08.800 --> 33:10.900
- Invisible?
- Yeah.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.200
- No. Hejust kept asking were we real cops.
- Ah.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.500
You know why he was
asking that?

33:15.500 --> 33:17.900
The guy bought a spell
to make him invisible to the police.

33:17.900 --> 33:19.800
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

33:19.700 --> 33:22.300
Homicide we'd like the guy for,
the D.O.A.'s a Santeria priest.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.100
This Mota guy goes to him
to cast a spell on his parole officer...

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
to make Mota invisible
to the cops.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.700
Yeah. So, when he don't get satisfaction,
he kills the Santeria priest...

33:30.700 --> 33:35.200
goes looking for another Santeria guy
to cast a better invisibility spell.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.600
- What room's the guy in?
- One of your detectives told my partner to put him in 3.

33:38.400 --> 33:42.400
I'm gonna move this Mota guy into the pokey
room before I bring down Mrs. Marquez.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.600
Yeah, good.

33:44.600 --> 33:47.100
So I guess the guy must figure
he got beat twice on his spells, huh?

33:47.100 --> 33:49.600
- Second priest didn't do any better for him than the D.O.A.
- Yeah.

33:49.600 --> 33:53.700
You see, James, uh, maybe that's
still open to debate. I got an idea.

33:57.900 --> 34:01.800
Hey, where'd this
Gabriel Mota guy go?

34:01.800 --> 34:05.000
Well, I thought you said
they had him in Interview 3.

34:04.900 --> 34:06.800
They said they left him in here.

34:06.900 --> 34:10.100
Those guys that brought him in here,
were they cops, or security guards?

34:10.000 --> 34:12.400
Security guards. For gosh sakes, Greg.
What difference does it make?

34:12.300 --> 34:16.000
Yeah, yeah. We got bigger
problems now.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.199
There's a suspect missing.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.500
Where could he have gone? You didn't
forget to lock the door, did you, Greg?

34:25.500 --> 34:29.900
Oh, yeah, yeah. Blame me.
Well, I guess we gotta tell the lieutenant.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.500
Man, this is one conversation
I'm not looking forward to.

34:32.400 --> 34:38.300
I mean, what are we gonna say to him?
You know, that the guy went invisible on us?

34:38.199 --> 34:40.600
I don't know.

34:42.699 --> 34:48.600
Hey, Gabriel, uh, when you go down
the hallway, don't forget to turn left.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.800
Yeah, and go in the door on the end there.
That's where we run our lineups.

34:51.699 --> 34:56.300
- You see me?
- Oh, just the last little while you started to materialize.

35:07.600 --> 35:11.200
So, no, uh, lesson tonight for AndyJ?

35:11.000 --> 35:14.200
He's got an orientation lecture
at his job.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.500
You gonna give
the heads-up to Ferdinand?

35:16.500 --> 35:20.100
I'm not putting this guy up for pope,
but there was nothing in this for him.

35:20.100 --> 35:22.000
Mm-hmm.
He was looking to help.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.900
That's all he was
looking to do, Ferdinand.

35:23.900 --> 35:25.800
And Kahlins winds up
jamming him up.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.000
The world's on its ass
when a stickup guy's more stand-up...

35:28.000 --> 35:30.300
than somebody
you're working with.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.100
- Oh, there they are.
- Hey.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.600
- Yeah.
- How are you doing?

35:36.600 --> 35:38.900
Good.

35:42.800 --> 35:46.100
- How'd you do?
- Uh, this Larry gave up the shooter.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.200
- From the other crew?
- Mm-hmm.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.800
- He said he was an eyewitness and agreed to testify.
- That's great.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.500
Downside, my boss
just walked in to celebrate.

35:53.500 --> 35:56.100
- Yes!
- Looks like he had a head start.

35:56.100 --> 35:59.300
Right-hand desk drawer,
that's where he keeps his bottle.

35:59.300 --> 36:03.400
- Always my personal favorite.
- I don't know how guys drink without a purse.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.000
Andy, were you and he
in uniform together?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.700
- You were in the bag with Kahlins?
- No.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.900
He said you went through
doors together...

36:09.900 --> 36:12.100
and you were
in service together in Vietnam.

36:12.100 --> 36:14.900
I knew you were
never detectives together.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.500
Excuse me.

36:19.400 --> 36:22.700
Hey, Ray.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.300
Hey, Andy! You ready to
fall off the wagon, huh?

36:25.300 --> 36:29.800
Ray, could I- Could I talk to you
for a minute privately over here?

36:29.700 --> 36:31.700
- What? Now?
- Yeah. Now. Just for a minute over here.

36:37.500 --> 36:41.600
- When were you in 'Nam?
- 1969.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.600
- Oh, yeah? What unit?
- Americal 198.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.300
Yeah? What base camp?

36:48.200 --> 36:50.000
Some gook village
outside of Saigon. What?

36:50.000 --> 36:53.200
- Do you remember all the names?
- Yeah. Every one of'em.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.500
Here's the deal, Ray.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.600
I don't know what the hell
you get out of it.

36:58.600 --> 37:03.500
But as far as I'm concerned, you can tell people
that you and me went through doors together.

37:03.400 --> 37:07.200
You can tell 'em you own the World Trade Center,
and you were married to Marilyn Monroe.

37:07.100 --> 37:12.200
You feel free to tell people that you put
every gangster since Legs Diamond behind bars...

37:12.100 --> 37:17.800
but Ray, you cannot lie
about what happened in Vietnam.

37:17.700 --> 37:22.000
Because that is an insult to people who
were there and who did what had to be done.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.600
I was in Vietnam, 1969.

37:24.600 --> 37:27.000
In what capacity, Ray?

37:27.000 --> 37:29.500
A maintenance unit.

37:31.100 --> 37:35.900
Then you say that. You tell the truth,
or you don't say anything at all.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.600
Do you hear me, Ray? Huh?
Or do we need to take this outside?

37:38.600 --> 37:40.600
See? That has always
been your problem, Sipowicz.

37:40.600 --> 37:43.800
That's why you're still doing precinct work.
You never learned to lighten up.

37:43.800 --> 37:47.600
You say anything you want, Ray,
but not about 'Nam. All right?

37:47.400 --> 37:49.400
Not about 'Nam.

37:50.900 --> 37:53.900
Andy. Andy,
wejust got beeped.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.200
Yeah.

38:03.100 --> 38:06.900
Fancy. He wants us to check out some
robbery/assault. Diane'll take Sylvia home.

38:06.800 --> 38:10.700
- What's going on?
- A couple of Colombians got taken off on Grand Street.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.100
- Let me see your complainant report.
- They don't want to make one.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.400
Get this. They say
they don't know each other.

38:33.300 --> 38:37.100
This one says he fell. The other one
said he got hit, but he's not sure by whom.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
They don't want the police.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.100
Mm-hmm.
So you fell down?

38:45.200 --> 38:48.300
- Si.
- By accident?

38:49.300 --> 38:52.600
- Accidental. Si.
- And you weren't robbed.

38:52.600 --> 38:55.500
- No robbery.
- And you're not a drug dealer.

38:55.400 --> 38:59.000
And a black guy with a scar right here
and track marks on both his hands...

38:59.000 --> 39:03.600
he didn't jump you and stick a gun
the size of a drainage pipe in your face...

39:03.400 --> 39:06.700
and take your little black satchel
with all your hard-earned drug money, huh?

39:06.700 --> 39:10.900
- None of that ever happened, right?
- No police, no robbery.

39:12.200 --> 39:15.500
Okay. Just checkin'.

39:15.400 --> 39:18.600
Put down complainant uncooperative
and refused medical aid.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.500
You got it.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.900
We got a Ferdinand Hollie
shot on Second and Fifth.

39:30.900 --> 39:33.500
- Your office said to respond.
- Is he D.O. A?

39:33.400 --> 39:35.500
Looks like he's going out.
I'll lead you over.

40:02.600 --> 40:06.300
A guy got shot in the back, hurt bad.
Won't let anyone touch him.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.200
Ferdinand.

40:10.100 --> 40:13.100
Don't touch me, man.

40:13.900 --> 40:15.800
Just take it easy.

40:15.900 --> 40:17.800
It's hot.

40:20.200 --> 40:26.000
- Didn't mess up my work. I had those Colombians' case.
- All right.

40:25.800 --> 40:30.700
It was Marvin Freeland's crew
bushwhacked me after.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.500
Halfway down the block.

40:32.500 --> 40:36.300
- Who from Freeland's crew?
- Ask your homey in the hockey jacket.

40:38.300 --> 40:41.900
Eddie Leon capped me.
Didn't see the wheel man.

40:41.900 --> 40:45.500
Maybe you can check the E.R.'s.
I got two off.

40:45.400 --> 40:48.600
All right. We'll check
for any wounds with.44s.

40:51.300 --> 40:54.700
- I'm sorry, Ferdinand.
- Uh-uh.

40:54.700 --> 40:58.700
Said it was a favor, not rent.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.500
That left it up to me.

41:03.900 --> 41:07.600
Got no b-bodies
unaccounted for, Robert.

41:07.400 --> 41:12.000
D- D-Don't let 'em
clear no cases off me.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.700
Hey. Hey.

41:33.300 --> 41:35.600
We took this off him.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.000
Andy, you voucher this for me?

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
I gotta go someplace.

41:46.100 --> 41:49.900
- I need a ride.
- Sure. Come on.

41:49.800 --> 41:53.200
Everybody use gloves.
Guy had the bug.

42:02.600 --> 42:05.800
No. I mean, this is true.

42:05.700 --> 42:08.800
Somebody down there
is wasting the alcohol. Forget it.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.400
We gotta talk.

42:14.300 --> 42:16.400
I've already had my Bible lesson.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.400
Let's... go.

42:26.500 --> 42:30.100
What? We going to the john? I needed
to do that for the last 20 minutes.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
- Come on.
- Yeah.

42:40.400 --> 42:43.800
Ferdinand Hollie got whacked
out on the street.

42:43.800 --> 42:47.800
Mm. What is the ceiling
for suspects? Fifty? Fifty-five?

42:47.700 --> 42:51.600
No, no, no. Marvin Freeland had him
capped, Kahlins, after you gave him up.

42:51.600 --> 42:54.400
Oh, God. You and me
have had this little chat.

42:54.400 --> 42:57.800
I have got no tears for your C.I.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.800
I will take a piss
in his honor, though...

42:59.700 --> 43:01.900
if you will vacate
the line of fire.

43:07.300 --> 43:10.100
He was a better guy
than you ever thought about being!

43:10.100 --> 43:12.000
And I am on a job with you!

43:12.000 --> 43:14.700
- We'll see for how long.
- Well, you go ahead.

43:14.600 --> 43:17.600
You bring up charges, Kahlins.
You go ahead. You get your witnesses.

43:17.600 --> 43:21.200
I bet there's a whole line of guys outside
waiting to stand up for you.

43:21.100 --> 43:25.400
Oh, God.

43:33.800 --> 43:36.100
Sorry for clearing out the place.
