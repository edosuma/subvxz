00:35.635 --> 00:37.235
WELL, THAT WAS
AN INTERESTING WALK.

00:37.302 --> 00:40.005
YES. UH, LISTEN,
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE

00:40.072 --> 00:41.540
FOR MY SKIRMISH
WITH CUPCAKE,

00:41.607 --> 00:43.775
BUT IN MY DEFENSE,

00:43.843 --> 00:46.227
I DID SEE
THE TENNIS BALL FIRST.

00:48.197 --> 00:50.548
WELL, HOPEFULLY YOU TWO
CAN START FRESH NEXT TIME.

00:50.616 --> 00:52.483
WELL, THAT'S UP TO HIM.

00:52.551 --> 00:54.702
OH, I HAVE TO PUSH BACK
OUR WALK ON THURSDAY.

00:54.770 --> 00:55.903
I'M GOING TO SEARS
TO GET A PICTURE

00:55.971 --> 00:58.005
OF ME AND THE DOGS
FOR MY CHRISTMAS CARD.

00:58.073 --> 01:00.191
SEARS? I CAN DO IT
RIGHT HERE.

01:00.259 --> 01:00.976
WELL, I KIND
OF LIKE SEARS

01:01.127 --> 01:02.494
'CAUSE THEY GIVE YOU
THE LITTLE MINI ONES-

01:02.562 --> 01:04.912
COME ON. IT'LL BE
MY HOLIDAY GIFT TO YOU.

01:04.980 --> 01:06.264
WELL, I ALREADY
HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

01:06.332 --> 01:07.582
<i>BUT IT'S MY GIFT
TO YOU.</i>

01:07.650 --> 01:08.517
AND I APPRECIATE THAT-

01:08.584 --> 01:09.801
IT'S MY GIFT!
OK. OK.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.120
OHH!

01:13.189 --> 01:15.490
THERE'S MY MAN!

01:15.558 --> 01:16.791
OOH!

01:16.858 --> 01:18.726
IT'S SO GOOD
TO HAVE YOU HOME!

01:18.794 --> 01:20.578
ALL RIGHT. SETTLE DOWN.

01:20.646 --> 01:22.096
JUST ME,
NOT THE SPARKLETTS GUY.

01:23.699 --> 01:25.116
I'M SORRY. JUST BOUNCING
OFF THE WALLS HERE.

01:25.184 --> 01:26.117
REALLY?

01:26.185 --> 01:27.218
YEAH, WHEN YOU
DON'T HAVE A JOB,

01:27.286 --> 01:28.753
YOU GET UP,

01:28.821 --> 01:30.221
YOU THROW
ON YOUR SWEATS,

01:30.289 --> 01:31.656
YOU EAT SOMETHING,
YOU SIT ON THE COUCH,

01:31.724 --> 01:34.358
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
IT'S TIME FOR BED.

01:34.426 --> 01:37.245
THAT IS WORD FOR WORD
ONE OF MY TOP DREAMS.

01:39.231 --> 01:41.149
COME ON, HONEY,
ENTERTAIN ME, ENTERTAIN ME.

01:41.217 --> 01:42.683
ALL RIGHT,
I'D LIKE TO START OFF

01:42.751 --> 01:46.221
WITH A PIECE CALLED
"HAVING DORITOS."

01:46.288 --> 01:48.206
SERIOUSLY, HONEY,

01:48.274 --> 01:49.908
SAY ONE OF THOSE
FUNNY THINGS YOU SAY.

01:49.975 --> 01:50.909
WHAT DO YA GOT?

01:53.179 --> 01:55.013
UH...

01:55.081 --> 01:57.749
ARR, RAHR, RAHR!

01:57.817 --> 02:02.420
RAHR!

02:03.672 --> 02:06.757
OK, I REMEMBER YOU BEING
A LOT MORE INTERESTING.

02:06.825 --> 02:08.443
LOOK, JUST GIVE ME
2 MINUTES, ALL RIGHT?

02:08.511 --> 02:09.544
WHY DON'T YOU READ
A MAGAZINE OR SOMETHING?

02:09.612 --> 02:12.012
I READ EVERY MAGAZINE
IN THE HOUSE ALREADY.

02:12.080 --> 02:12.847
WELL, HERE YOU GO,

02:12.915 --> 02:14.365
READ
MY COMPANY NEWSLETTER,

02:14.433 --> 02:16.885
<i>I.P. YES. GO TO TOWN.</i>

02:18.520 --> 02:20.705
"SNAP, CRACKLE, AND POP:

02:20.773 --> 02:24.208
I.P.S. SWITCHES
BUBBLE WRAP SUPPLIERS."

02:27.747 --> 02:29.363
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA READ THIS.

02:30.382 --> 02:31.933
KIDS, I THINK WE SHOULD
NAIL DOWN A DATE

02:32.000 --> 02:33.935
FOR OUR CHRISTMAS CARD
PHOTO SHOOT.

02:34.002 --> 02:35.803
AND AS FAR
AS WARDROBE GOES,

02:35.871 --> 02:40.108
I'M THINKIN' EVERYONE
IN DENIM SHIRTS AND JEANS.

02:40.176 --> 02:42.243
AND I'M THINKING NO PICTURE
AND YOU GO DOWNSTAIRS

02:42.311 --> 02:44.512
AND GET LAST NIGHT'S
BROCCOLI OUT OF YOUR TEETH.

02:46.132 --> 02:47.565
COME ON, DARLING,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

02:47.633 --> 02:50.719
LET'S SHOW A LITTLE
FATHER-DAUGHTER HOLIDAY SPIRIT.

02:50.786 --> 02:52.020
WHO KNOWS
HOW MANY CHRISTMASES

02:52.088 --> 02:53.521
WE HAVE LEFT TOGETHER?

02:53.589 --> 02:54.923
OHH.

02:54.991 --> 02:56.791
MAYBE NEXT YEAR,
DADDY, OK?

02:56.859 --> 02:57.959
FINE.

02:58.027 --> 03:01.579
I WANNA WISH YOU BOTH
A MERRY CHRISTMAS IN HELL!

03:03.583 --> 03:05.466
OH, MY GOD,
LOOK AT THIS.

03:05.534 --> 03:07.969
4 DORITOS
GOT BAKED TOGETHER.

03:14.209 --> 03:17.012
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO EAT
IT OR DONATE IT TO SCIENCE.

03:18.964 --> 03:22.483
HUH.

03:22.551 --> 03:23.484
WHAT?

03:23.552 --> 03:25.720
YOUR DEPOT IS HIRING
PAYROLL ASSISTANTS

03:25.788 --> 03:28.657
TO HANDLE
THE EXTRA HOLIDAY LOAD.

03:28.724 --> 03:30.725
THEY NEED PEOPLE
WHO CAN TYPE AND DO PAYROLL.

03:30.793 --> 03:31.826
I'VE DONE BOTH.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.230
I SHOULD APPLY
FOR THIS, RIGHT?

03:35.297 --> 03:36.498
NO,
I DON'T KNOW.

03:36.565 --> 03:38.165
IT WOULD BE SO GREAT
TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE

03:38.233 --> 03:40.284
DURING THE DAY
AND MAKE A LITTLE MONEY.

03:40.352 --> 03:42.137
YOU KNOW? AND I'D FEEL LIKE
I WAS PART OF THE WORLD AGAIN.

03:42.204 --> 03:44.339
I'M GONNA GO E-MAIL
MY RÉSUMÉ RIGHT NOW.

03:44.406 --> 03:46.157
OH. IF IT'S COOL
WITH YOU,

03:46.225 --> 03:48.393
BECAUSE I WOULD BE INVADING
ON YOUR TURF, YOU KNOW?

03:48.461 --> 03:49.594
WHAT?
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

03:49.662 --> 03:50.612
YEAH?

03:52.264 --> 03:54.532
YEAH!

03:54.600 --> 03:56.734
GREAT! THANKS, BABY!
OH, YEAH!

03:58.554 --> 04:00.788
No!

04:05.795 --> 04:06.844
SO SHE'S STANDING
ON THE CURB,

04:06.912 --> 04:08.963
AND I'M GETTIN' HER PACKAGES
OUT OF THE TRUCK,

04:09.031 --> 04:10.831
WHEN OUT OF NOWHERE
THIS CAR FLIES BY,

04:10.899 --> 04:12.100
HITS THIS HUGE PUDDLE,

04:12.167 --> 04:13.234
AND BAM!

04:13.302 --> 04:15.169
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A WET T-SHIRT CONTEST.

04:17.373 --> 04:18.990
ME AGAINST HER.

04:19.058 --> 04:21.559
SHE'S WINNING,
BUT I'M HOLDING MY OWN.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.694
SO, ANYWAY, SHE'S
JUST STANDING THERE,

04:23.762 --> 04:25.947
AND SHE'S GOT SOME
GRADE-A SWEET POTATOES.

04:26.015 --> 04:26.948
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

04:27.016 --> 04:28.983
SO WHAT SHE DOES IS-
GUESS WHO?

04:29.051 --> 04:31.686
HEY!

04:31.754 --> 04:32.754
HI, HONEY.

04:32.821 --> 04:33.755
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?

04:33.822 --> 04:35.423
I HEARD
SWEET POTATOES.

04:35.490 --> 04:36.857
UH, YEAH.

04:36.925 --> 04:38.710
WE WERE THINKING
ABOUT GETTIN' 'EM

04:38.777 --> 04:40.878
FOR
THE VENDING MACHINE.

04:42.364 --> 04:44.064
ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST, UH,

04:44.132 --> 04:47.668
TELLING A STORY
ABOUT THIS FEMALE PERSON

04:47.736 --> 04:49.537
ON MY ROUTE. SORRY.

04:49.605 --> 04:51.572
OH, THAT'S OK. I KNOW
WHAT GUYS TALK ABOUT.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.173
KEEP GOIN' LIKE
I WASN'T EVEN HERE.

04:53.241 --> 04:54.509
WAS SHE HOT?

04:56.144 --> 04:58.813
THAT'S OK.
OH, COME ON!

04:58.881 --> 05:00.014
ALL RIGHT, WELL, UH,

05:00.081 --> 05:02.483
THIS W-WOMAN
GOT SPLASHED BY A CAR

05:02.551 --> 05:05.319
AND HER-HER SHIRT
KIND OF GOT WET.

05:05.387 --> 05:09.023
THAT'S WHERE THE PREVIOUSLY
MENTIONED SWEET POTATOES COME IN.

05:10.308 --> 05:11.542
SO I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW,

05:11.610 --> 05:14.245
"TAKE YOUR PACKAGE. I'M
NOT HERE FOR THE SHOW, LADY.

05:14.312 --> 05:15.479
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT CRAP
YOU'RE TRYIN' TO PULL,

05:15.547 --> 05:16.547
BUT I LOVE MY WIFE."

05:16.615 --> 05:18.116
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

05:18.183 --> 05:19.550
GOD.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.386
GOOD ONE, HONEY.

05:22.454 --> 05:24.054
ALL RIGHT, SNACK TIME.

05:24.122 --> 05:26.056
HONEY, CAN I TELL YOU
HOW GOOD IT FEELS

05:26.124 --> 05:27.324
TO BE BACK AT WORK?

05:27.392 --> 05:28.743
I ALREADY HAVE
A BEST FRIEND UPSTAIRS

05:28.811 --> 05:31.579
AND A GIRL
WE BOTH HATE.

05:31.647 --> 05:32.730
GOOD FOR YOU.
YEAH.

05:32.797 --> 05:33.931
SO, WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA GET?

05:33.999 --> 05:36.167
EH, I'M NOT SURE YET.

05:36.235 --> 05:36.901
HEY, HOW 'BOUT THIS?

05:36.968 --> 05:37.986
YOU PICK THE LETTER.

05:38.053 --> 05:39.053
I PICK THE NUMBER.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.488
LIVE DANGEROUSLY.

05:40.555 --> 05:42.490
MMM, I DON'T THINK SO.

05:42.557 --> 05:45.392
I CAN'T RISK ENDING UP
WITH A COMB FOR LUNCH.

05:46.812 --> 05:48.479
I THINK
I'M GOIN' WITH FRITOS.

05:48.547 --> 05:50.147
OH, DON'T GET THE FRITOS.
GET THE CHEETOS.

05:50.215 --> 05:51.348
I'M IN THE MOOD
FOR THOSE.

05:51.416 --> 05:53.117
UH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
FOR 70 CENTS,

05:53.184 --> 05:55.620
YOU CAN GET
YOUR VERY OWN BAG.

05:55.687 --> 05:57.672
I KNOW, BUT
I ONLY WANT A FEW.

05:57.740 --> 05:59.641
COME ON, J-6, J-6, J-6,
J-6, J-6, J-6-

05:59.708 --> 06:01.142
O- O-OK.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.594

06:18.577 --> 06:21.079
HI, HONEY!

06:21.146 --> 06:23.781
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'
ON THE C.B.?

06:23.848 --> 06:26.384
WANDA'S TEACHIN' ME HOW.
RIGHT, WANDA?

06:26.452 --> 06:28.819
THAT'S RIGHT, DOUG.

06:30.005 --> 06:31.339
WELL...

06:31.406 --> 06:33.942
WE'RE ALL HERE, THEN.

06:34.009 --> 06:37.011
SO, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

06:37.079 --> 06:38.112
UH...

06:38.180 --> 06:40.582
JUST DOIN' MY ROUTE.

06:40.649 --> 06:42.116
OH, YOU SAY "ROWT"?
I SAY "ROOT."

06:43.486 --> 06:44.986
AND YET
WE STILL MAKE IT WORK.

06:45.053 --> 06:46.688
OK. GOTTA WRAP THIS UP.

06:46.755 --> 06:48.472
GOT A PACKAGE THING
TO DO.

06:48.540 --> 06:51.493
OK. BYE, HONEY!

06:51.560 --> 06:52.694
BYE.
OH, WAIT!

06:52.761 --> 06:54.095
SAY GOOD-BYE
TO WANDA.

06:56.465 --> 06:58.366
BYE, WANDA.

06:58.433 --> 07:00.452
BYE, DOUG.

07:04.723 --> 07:07.758
OK, I NEED HERSHEY
IN A LITTLE TIGHTER.

07:07.826 --> 07:09.077
CUPCAKE,

07:09.144 --> 07:10.377
QUIT THE FUNNY BUSINESS.

07:10.445 --> 07:13.280
THIS IS A FAMILY PICTURE.

07:13.348 --> 07:14.816
AND THAT'S IT. NOW, HOLD IT.

07:25.477 --> 07:27.412
NOW, JUST WAIT
FOR THE FLASH.

07:27.479 --> 07:28.646
ARTHUR,

07:28.713 --> 07:29.463
I HADN'T
PLANNED ON YOU

07:29.615 --> 07:31.148
<i>ACTUALLY BEING
IN THE PHOTO.</i>

07:31.216 --> 07:33.885
WHY NOT? IT'S A PICTURE
OF EVERYONE YOU WALK.

07:33.952 --> 07:36.387
WELL. YEAH, BUT I'M
SENDING THESE TO MY CLIENTS,

07:36.454 --> 07:37.688
AND I'M NOT SURE
THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND

07:37.756 --> 07:41.058
THAT I WALK
A HUMAN BEING.

07:41.126 --> 07:42.877
WHEN THEY SEE YOUR NAME
ON THE LIST,

07:42.945 --> 07:45.747
I TELL THEM
YOU'RE A SCHNAUZER.

07:45.814 --> 07:47.365
JUST SMILE.

07:47.432 --> 07:48.365
ARTHUR, I DON'T THINK
I REALLY WANNA DO-

07:48.433 --> 07:49.934
DO IT OR YOU'RE FIRED!

07:50.002 --> 07:51.635
NOW SMILE.

07:53.172 --> 07:54.105
ONLY 80 MORE SECONDS.

07:54.173 --> 07:55.706
OK. I'M GOING TO SEARS.

07:55.774 --> 07:56.874
FINE, BUT IF
YOU'RE SO WORRIED

07:56.942 --> 07:58.342
ABOUT YOUR PICTURE
BEING RUINED,

07:58.410 --> 07:59.610
I'D WORRY ABOUT HIM!

07:59.678 --> 08:00.561
BUSTER?

08:00.712 --> 08:02.547
SOMETHING THAT UGLY
DOESN'T DESERVE A NAME.

08:08.036 --> 08:10.822
ARE YOU SURE NORTHERN
BOULEVARD'S THE BEST WAY TO GO?

08:10.889 --> 08:12.389
THERE'S SO MANY LIGHTS.

08:12.457 --> 08:14.591
I THINK WE SHOULD CUT
THROUGH THE WALDBAUM'S

08:14.659 --> 08:15.927
AND GO THROUGH
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

08:15.994 --> 08:17.161
YOU KNOW? AND THEN
WE'D AVOID ALL THAT.

08:17.229 --> 08:19.430
LET'S TRY THAT
TOMORROW.

08:23.469 --> 08:24.618
OKEYDOKE.

08:27.973 --> 08:29.507
OHH!

08:29.574 --> 08:31.142
AHH.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.410
I AM BEAT. I'M GONNA
HEAD UPSTAIRS TO BED.

08:33.479 --> 08:34.779
YEAH,
ME, TOO.

08:38.216 --> 08:39.967
YOU KNOW WHAT? ACTUALLY,
I'M GONNA STAY DOWN

08:40.034 --> 08:41.469
AND ACTUALLY WATCH
A LITTLE TELE-VIS-I-ON

08:41.535 --> 08:42.770
FOR A WHILE.

08:45.540 --> 08:46.641
OK, BABY.
OK.

09:09.464 --> 09:10.998
OH, IS THAT
PATRICK SWAYZE?

09:59.498 --> 10:00.498
HEY, MAN.

10:00.566 --> 10:01.499
HAVE YOU SEEN CARRIE?

10:01.567 --> 10:02.766
NO.

10:02.834 --> 10:05.419
THANK GOD!

10:05.487 --> 10:07.188
I GOTTA HIT THE MEN'S ROOM
WHERE I CAN GRAB 20 MINUTES ALONE

10:07.255 --> 10:08.690
BEFORE WE DRIVE HOME
TONIGHT.

10:08.757 --> 10:09.907
YEAH,
ABOUT ALL THAT TIME

10:09.974 --> 10:13.160
YOU'RE SPENDING
IN THE BATHROOM...

10:13.228 --> 10:14.762
THE OTHER DRIVERS ARE
GETTING A LITTLE CREEPED OUT

10:14.830 --> 10:17.765
WALKING IN AND FINDING YOU IN
THAT FOLDING CHAIR BY THE URINALS.

10:20.051 --> 10:21.853
I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S THE ONLY
WAY I CAN ESCAPE HER.

10:21.920 --> 10:25.006
SHE'S EVERYWHERE!

10:25.074 --> 10:25.907
DOUG?

10:25.974 --> 10:27.391
OH, MY GOD!
COVER FOR ME!

10:32.915 --> 10:33.847
HEY.
HEY.

10:33.916 --> 10:34.949
YOU SEE
THE BIG GUY?

10:35.017 --> 10:36.750
UH, I-I THINK HE'S
STILL OUT ON HIS ROUTE.

10:37.769 --> 10:39.287
BUT HIS TRUCK'S
RIGHT THERE.

10:39.354 --> 10:42.656
OH, HE-HE MUST BE
DELIVERING ON FOOT, THEN.

10:43.575 --> 10:44.591
YOU GUYS DO THAT?

10:44.659 --> 10:47.161
UH, WE LIKE TO MIX IT UP.

10:48.413 --> 10:49.880
UH, THAT'S MY SNACK.

10:51.082 --> 10:52.082
HEY, THAT'S
MY LEAN POCKET.

10:52.150 --> 10:54.318
NO, IT'S NOT.

10:54.385 --> 10:55.853
I NEED TO DO THIS.

11:34.326 --> 11:35.459

11:41.249 --> 11:43.451
OH, I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU CAN STORE SOME STUFF

11:43.518 --> 11:44.785
IN YOUR LOCKER FOR ME.

11:44.853 --> 11:46.787

11:52.227 --> 11:55.062

11:55.130 --> 11:58.098
AND WHEN WILL THAT BE?!

11:58.166 --> 11:59.750

11:59.817 --> 12:01.401
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST...

12:01.469 --> 12:03.070
EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY,

12:03.138 --> 12:05.572

CALLING ME IN THE TRUCK.

12:05.641 --> 12:08.109
ALL NIGHT WITH ME, YOU,
AND PATRICK SWAYZE.

12:08.176 --> 12:10.277
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

12:10.345 --> 12:13.181
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, DOUG, MAYBE I
WENT A LITTLE OVERBOARD HERE, OK?

12:13.248 --> 12:14.782
MAYBE I CALLED YOU
A LITTLE TOO MUCH

12:14.849 --> 12:15.916
ON YOUR LITTLE RADIO THERE,

12:15.984 --> 12:17.818
BUT I'M ONLY GONNA
BE HERE FOR 2 WEEKS!

12:17.886 --> 12:19.587
YOU COULDN'T TAKE IT
FOR 2 WEEKS?

12:19.655 --> 12:20.721
I WAS SURPRISED MYSELF!

12:20.789 --> 12:22.523
YOU KNOW? BUT 2 WEEKS
CAN SEEM PRETTY LONG!

12:22.591 --> 12:24.458
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
IF YOU'RE ON JURY DUTY

12:24.526 --> 12:26.927
OR TRAPPED IN A MINE!

12:26.995 --> 12:28.595
OH! OK, SO WORKING WITH ME

12:28.663 --> 12:30.931
IS LIKE BEING
TRAPPED IN A MINE.

12:30.999 --> 12:32.432
OK, WELL, I-

12:32.500 --> 12:33.467
YOU KNOW WHAT, DOUG?

12:33.534 --> 12:36.270
I AM SO SORRY
THAT MY VERY PRESENCE HERE

12:36.338 --> 12:38.105
HAS BEEN SO AWFUL FOR YOU.

12:39.057 --> 12:40.374

IT'S REALLY FUNNY,

12:40.441 --> 12:42.510

12:47.615 --> 12:49.216

12:49.284 --> 12:51.752
WATCHING YOU WORK HAS
ACTUALLY BEEN A TURN-ON FOR ME,

12:51.819 --> 12:53.320
IF YOU COULD BELIEVE THAT.

13:01.129 --> 13:02.629
REALLY?

13:02.697 --> 13:05.032
YEAH. YOU KNOW, WATCHING
YOU LIFT ALL THOSE HEAVY BOXES

13:05.100 --> 13:08.802

13:08.870 --> 13:11.071
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
AT WORK, YOU KNOW?

13:11.139 --> 13:12.973
YOU'RE GOOD AT
WHAT YOU DO. IT'S SEXY.

13:16.011 --> 13:17.845
IT IS?

13:17.913 --> 13:20.064
YEAH, BUT
YOU HATE ME, SO...

13:20.132 --> 13:21.132
WHAT'S THE POINT?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.367
I-

13:23.435 --> 13:24.669
I FEEL
LIKE AN IDIOT NOW.

13:24.736 --> 13:26.520
WELL, YOU SHOULD.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.139
LOOK,
I'M-I'M SORRY.

13:28.206 --> 13:30.674
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.

13:38.283 --> 13:40.684
SO YOU LIKE
THE FORKLIFT, HUH?

13:42.354 --> 13:43.654
YEAH.

13:43.722 --> 13:46.724
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU RAISE
AND SWIVEL AT THE SAME TIME.

13:46.791 --> 13:49.126
YOU KNOW, THAT BREAKS
EVERY SAFETY CODE, BUT...

13:49.194 --> 13:50.862
IT'S MY SIGNATURE MOVE.

13:54.849 --> 13:57.351

15:14.880 --> 15:19.049
TURNIN' THIS PLACE
INTO I.P. "OH, YES."

15:20.218 --> 15:21.652
THAT'S THE STORY, DUKE.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.655
<i>AND BY THE WAY,
HE PUNCHED OUT AFTER.</i>

15:24.723 --> 15:26.490
ROCKIN' ON THE CLOCK.

15:26.558 --> 15:29.126
NOW, THAT'S
THE WAY TO DO IT.

15:29.193 --> 15:31.061
I HEARD IT WAS
SURPRISINGLY TENDER.

15:32.280 --> 15:33.681
I THINK IT'S
PRETTY INAPPROPRIATE.

15:33.749 --> 15:34.682

16:27.969 --> 16:30.688
JOYOUS? INSPIRED?

16:30.755 --> 16:32.489
GAY.

16:32.557 --> 16:35.309
CHRISTMAS IS NO TIME
FOR BIGOTRY!

16:35.377 --> 16:36.794
I'M NOT HOMOPHOBIC!

16:36.862 --> 16:40.414
I JUST DON'T WANNA
BE ON A CARD WITH YOU.

16:40.482 --> 16:41.715
THESE AREN'T EVEN REAL!

16:41.783 --> 16:43.200
OF COURSE NOT.
THEY'RE PROP COOKIES.

16:43.268 --> 16:45.886

16:45.954 --> 16:47.154
MERRY CHRISTMAS, ARTHUR.

16:47.222 --> 16:48.639

17:30.899 --> 17:32.833
