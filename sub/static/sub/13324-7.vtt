WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.045
Let's move on.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.297
Donovan, l know that you and Cleo

00:06.382 --> 00:09.050
had some words about how much time
you've been spending in the library.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.802
-So do you want to talk about that?
-Yes.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.054
Cleo has been real supportive lately.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.056
He knows that l have to get my law degree

00:15.140 --> 00:18.142
so l can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
that l'm innocent.

00:18.227 --> 00:22.814
They have you on videotape stabbing
three people at a Relax The Back store.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.775
l ain't said it was going to be easy.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.821
Now, Cleo, l know you were angry about
not spending enough time with Donovan.

00:29.905 --> 00:31.823
You want to tell us
why you were able to let that go?

00:31.907 --> 00:35.034
l don't want to, but l have to.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.372
Donovan.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.124
You know how we said

00:41.208 --> 00:44.252
that if one of us gets out before the other
that we would kill ourselves?

00:46.255 --> 00:48.089
l'd like to revisit that.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.634
What?

00:52.720 --> 00:54.095
l'm getting out today.

00:54.179 --> 00:57.140
l got a letter last week,
something about prison overcrowding.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.808
What?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.226
You knew for a week?

01:00.728 --> 01:03.312
Donovan, Donovan, you're obviously hurt.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.149
You need to express to Cleo
how that makes you feel.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.318
Otherwise, hurt turns to anger,
anger turns to rage, and rage turns to...

01:09.403 --> 01:10.737
Holy crap!

01:12.406 --> 01:14.532
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
l got this. l got this. l got this.

01:14.616 --> 01:15.658
Donovan, Donovan.

01:15.743 --> 01:19.328
-Why didn't you tell me?
-l thought you might get mad.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.873
Well, he did kill three people
over a back pillow, so good call.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.209
l'm so sorry, monster.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.335
No!

01:26.420 --> 01:28.588
l'm not your monster anymore.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.716
You broke my heart, Cleo.

01:32.426 --> 01:36.095
l could have traded you for Jell-O,
and l didn't.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.139
Here you go, bro.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.895
-How about now?
-Now's good.

01:46.607 --> 01:50.735
Okay, l know it goes without saying,
but l'm going to go ahead and say it.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.821
We never
hand the angry man a second chair.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.831
Now remember,
when you approach the dish,

02:03.916 --> 02:05.792
you gotta do something
to distract the pitcher.

02:05.876 --> 02:08.044
Wink at her like
maybe you know something she doesn't.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.506
Like this generation will be the first
to do worse than their parents

02:11.590 --> 02:13.174
and we're all doomed for failure?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.427
-Just try to hit the ball and have fun.
-Gotcha.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.388
This tournament's making me nuts.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.099
l don't even know how Sam's going to
deal with the bus ride there

02:22.184 --> 02:23.518
with her OCD and everything.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.770
She's terrified of truck-stop bathrooms.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.731
Hey, l want my teenage daughter
terrified of truck-stop bathrooms.

02:29.608 --> 02:30.775
Good point.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.903
Hey, while we have a second,
will you look at something?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.030
lt's a new business l'm looking into.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.534
"Green Goddesses"?

02:39.618 --> 02:44.622
lt's a maid-service franchise that hires
hot maids and only uses green products.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.040
Hot maids?

02:46.124 --> 02:48.668
Where are you going to find
beautiful women who want to clean toilets?

02:48.752 --> 02:51.337
Men have been looking for that
for thousands of years.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.547
They help you.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.632
You give Green Goddesses $1 0,000,

02:54.716 --> 02:58.302
and they give you the logo,
the cleaning supplies, and the short skirts.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.554
lt's a no-brainer.

02:59.847 --> 03:04.350
So for 1 0 grand you get Lysol
and a logo of a dolphin with tits and a mop?

03:05.435 --> 03:09.814
Okay, first of all, it's a mermaid
with an eco-friendly dolphin's head.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.484
And why do you have to be so negative?

03:13.861 --> 03:15.736
Remember Downward Dog,

03:16.530 --> 03:18.030
the yoga studio

03:18.740 --> 03:20.032
for dogs?

03:23.787 --> 03:24.912
Cleo.

03:25.372 --> 03:29.208
-lt's Derek on the outside.
-Hi. l don't think we've met.

03:29.293 --> 03:32.962
This is Derek, an old ballplayer buddy.
This is my ex-wife, Jennifer.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.505
-Hey.
-Hi.

03:34.590 --> 03:38.092
-Why would you ex this?
-Well, who says it was his idea?

03:39.553 --> 03:41.679
l don't recognize you.
Where did you and Charlie play?

03:41.763 --> 03:43.681
He played at Akron. Hell of a ballplayer.

03:44.725 --> 03:45.975
Switch-hitter.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.479
Mom, let's go to the bus.
We're going to be late.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.982
-All right.
-Bye, kiddo.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.234
Bye. Nice meeting you.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.532
-What the hell are you doing here?
-l went to see my wife.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.576
Wait, wait, wait. You have a wife?

04:03.660 --> 04:04.744
l'm PG, man.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.831
Prison gay.
What happens in jail, stays in jail.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.042
So what happened with your wife?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.877
She said she was going to wait for me,

04:12.961 --> 04:14.795
but there's a Jack in the Box
where my house was,

04:14.880 --> 04:17.965
she moved to San Diego with
some Chinese guy and they got three kids.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.636
And a damn dog named Cleo.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.432
Wow, that really sucks.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.938
So, can l get you some water or something?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.440
You know why l'm here.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.442
For water?

04:37.152 --> 04:39.612
My parole officer said
if l don't find an address by tonight,

04:39.696 --> 04:42.198
l got to go to a county facility.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.824
l need a place to stay.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.202
Look, look, Derek, l would love to help you,

04:46.286 --> 04:49.038
but l gotta keep our relationship
strictly professional.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.083
But if you want to come here
for anger therapy classes,

04:52.167 --> 04:53.376
l'd be more than happy to do that.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.670
-When's the next session?
-Tomorrow, 2:00 p.m.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.589
Great! l'm going to wait on the couch.

05:03.637 --> 05:07.264
Everybody, this is Derek. Derek
is a former member of my prison group.

05:07.349 --> 05:10.935
l want to remind you all that, as always,
everyone's private life is confidential.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.228
Nothing leaves this room.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.063
Unless he steals it.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.235
Okay, let's just pick up
where we left off last time.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.112
-Patrick?
-Right, so...

05:21.196 --> 05:23.990
l was at this restaurant
having dinner with a friend,

05:24.074 --> 05:27.785
and this prick next to me says that l'm
too loud and threatens to call the manager.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.745
l got something like that.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.456
l shared a cell with a Russian gangster,
and he said l talked too loud

05:32.541 --> 05:35.334
and if l didn't stop,
he'd tie my balls around my neck.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.007
He called it a "Moscow Bow Tie".

05:44.845 --> 05:47.388
Look how much we all have in common.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.934
-And what happened, Patrick?
-Never mind.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.980
Lacey,
how are things going with your mom?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.314
She's insane.

05:57.399 --> 06:00.359
lf l want to keep getting my allowance,
l have to get a job.

06:00.444 --> 06:03.070
l thought parents
were supposed to fund you unconditionally.

06:03.739 --> 06:06.866
That's love you unconditionally.
And only dogs do that.

06:06.950 --> 06:10.369
Well, she gives my dog an allowance, too,
and he doesn't have to get a job.

06:10.912 --> 06:15.416
l feel you, girl. Mothers can be frustrating.
Mine would burn me with cigarettes.

06:16.084 --> 06:20.046
You learn to stop reaching
across the table for food real quick.

06:23.759 --> 06:26.427
Ed, l'm guessing you're going to pass
on the story about the gum wrappers?

06:26.511 --> 06:28.179
Yeah.

06:32.100 --> 06:36.353
You know, Prison-Break Jones over there
is not the only guy who has had a tough life.

06:36.438 --> 06:37.438
l'm sorry, forgot your name.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.357
My mother burned me, too,

06:40.442 --> 06:44.278
with unending,
subtle critiques of my clothes.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.782
You may not see the scars, they're there.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.868
Well, l think
we can all take a lesson from this.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.370
When you think
your problems are really big, remember,

06:53.455 --> 06:55.956
at least
no one is tying yourjunk around your neck.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.002
Don't quote me on that.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.883
-Hey, Derek. How are you doing?
-Good, good.

07:05.967 --> 07:09.011
Charlie's letting me crash for a few days,
so l thought l'd help out a little.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.054
Well, don't mind me.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.140
l'm just going to borrow Charlie's
washing machine for a couple of loads.

07:13.225 --> 07:17.353
Mine keeps lighting up "unbalanced."
l think it's making fun of me.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.942
You know what? Let me get that for you.
l'm doing Charlie's and mine anyway.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.693
Wow, thank you.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.904
Don't mind the granny panties.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.824
They're not mine.
They just came with the basket.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.328
lf your washing machine's broke,
l'm pretty handy. l can take a look at it.

07:34.663 --> 07:35.913
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:35.997 --> 07:39.625
Okay. That'd be great.
That'd be amazing. Thank you.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.463
Why is he doing your laundry?

07:44.548 --> 07:47.550
Because he offered, like a gentleman,
Charlie.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.511
ls there a Mrs. Gentleman?

07:52.681 --> 07:53.722
Wow.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.559
Okay, l should probably
tell you something about Derek.

07:57.018 --> 07:57.977
Not a ballplayer.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.396
He was a member
of the prison group l volunteer with.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.774
-You're kidding.
-Nope. Hard-core criminal.

08:03.859 --> 08:06.652
Twelve years behind bars, grand theft auto,
repeat offender, the whole package.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.155
So he's good-looking,
not afraid of commitment,

08:09.239 --> 08:11.657
and always drives a nice new car?

08:13.535 --> 08:15.953
-Don't go there, Jen.
-Pardon me?

08:16.037 --> 08:17.621
Don't get involved with this guy, Jen.

08:17.706 --> 08:21.000
Do you really think
l'm dumb enough to date a felon?

08:22.043 --> 08:25.546
Why do you always
second-guess everything l do?

08:26.214 --> 08:27.965
Are you sure
you want to ask me that question?

08:28.049 --> 08:29.717
Why wouldn't... Hey, quit it.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.723
As soon as you write my alimony check,
give me some of that pizza,

08:35.807 --> 08:37.766
and he's done with my laundry,
l'm out of here.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.518
l can take care of myself, you know?

08:40.770 --> 08:43.189
-Did you TiVo Project Runway for me?
-Yeah.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.232
l'm going to go watch it.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.573
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.868
See that guy down there?

08:56.328 --> 08:57.328
lt's my patient.

08:57.412 --> 09:00.289
-ls he the one that can't get mad?
-Yeah, we'll see.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.250
He thinks he's here
because l'm setting him up on a date,

09:03.335 --> 09:05.836
but l want you to do everything you can
to get him to the breaking point.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.588
How about l marry him?

09:09.090 --> 09:10.674
We're just trying to get him mad,
not kill him.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.810
l am so sorry.

09:21.895 --> 09:25.189
-l hope those weren't your good clothes.
-No.

09:25.273 --> 09:29.276
l'm meeting a girl, but it's okay.
lt was an honest mistake.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.450
That wasn't as honest.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.328
Maybe l'll just have nuts.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.462
Well, at least now you've got some
where yours ought to be.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.132
Hey. What's your name?

09:54.427 --> 09:57.346
And l feel bad that Jen
walked away thinking l called her stupid.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.516
-Do you think Jen's stupid?
-No, no.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.979
l mean, you and l, we have degrees,
we read books, we're academic smart.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.941
Jen is more
"l'm going up the down escalator,

10:09.025 --> 10:12.194
"l'm not getting anywhere,
so l should probably turn around" smart.

10:13.989 --> 10:18.242
You know, you might want to get down off
your high horse there for a minute, buddy.

10:18.326 --> 10:21.078
l know Jennifer,
and while she's no Rhodes Scholar,

10:21.162 --> 10:23.455
she's probably
smarter than you are in a lot of ways.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.667
l know one way she's not.
l know what Rhodes Scholar means.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.588
You know, there's lots of different types
of intelligence, Charlie.

10:31.673 --> 10:35.509
l bet, if l wanted to,
l could make you feel dumb.

10:36.511 --> 10:40.347
For example, spatial-visual intelligence.

10:40.682 --> 10:44.685
Move only two matches to make a decagon.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.396
That's easy.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.858
Define "decagon."

10:52.027 --> 10:53.861
Ten-sided figure. And don't worry.

10:53.945 --> 10:58.032
Even though you're dumb, l still think
you're pretty, and we're having sex tonight.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.618
What's this?

11:01.703 --> 11:04.538
You have to make a 1 0-sided figure
moving only two matches.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.499
l can do it moving one.

11:08.543 --> 11:09.668
There.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.046
Oh, my God! She's a genius.

11:12.547 --> 11:16.717
And if l do this and this...

11:17.218 --> 11:19.136
Stick man with a boner.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.350
Might have been a fluke.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.854
You're right. You're right.
l can be the bigger man.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.190
l'm going to go apologize.
l'll meet you back at your place later.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.399
Okay.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.526
And for the record...

11:35.737 --> 11:38.572
Stick man with a coke problem.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.703
Stick man after a car accident,

11:49.250 --> 11:51.377
because of his coke problem.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.758
Stick man living in a tent

11:58.426 --> 12:02.346
because he lost his house because
of the car accident and his coke problem.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.724
Who's the genius now?

12:10.105 --> 12:11.438
Just a minute.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.904
l'm sorry, l should have called.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.156
Yeah, that would have been a good idea.

12:21.783 --> 12:25.202
l was driving home,
and l thought l owe you an apology.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.537
You're not stupid.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.705
You're a smart person
and you know exactly what you're doing.

12:28.790 --> 12:33.460
Baby, if that's the food, just bring it to bed.
l'm ready to give you a massage.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.302
Oh, damn!

12:44.139 --> 12:46.390
You don't answer the door
when your nails are wet,

12:46.474 --> 12:49.184
but you're in the middle of
a prison rub-down and it's, "Come on in."

12:57.485 --> 12:59.570
How stupid can one woman be?

12:59.988 --> 13:03.907
l know this game. Sarah Palin,
Nancy Pelosi, or Jennifer, your ex-wife.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.827
She's sleeping with Derek.

13:07.328 --> 13:11.165
l know it's unpopular,
but l'm going to go with the liberal, Pelosi.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.500
Okay, pants off.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.087
l told her not to, and then she got mad at me
for assuming she'd do something stupid.

13:17.172 --> 13:20.007
-And then what does she do?
-The gay felon.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.176
Did she even know he was gay?

13:22.260 --> 13:25.095
Yeah, she knows.
She's a big girl. She takes precautions.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.306
lt's not what l'm worried about.
l'm worried about the felon part.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.850
Yeah, that's a reasonable concern.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.518
Okay, l'll get the shirt.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.604
l don't want this guy in my life.

13:33.688 --> 13:37.191
He was in prison.
He steals things and hides them in his ass.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.026
"Hey, Charlie, where are your candlesticks?"

13:39.110 --> 13:42.446
"l don't know. Why don't you
check my ex-wife's boyfriend's ass?"

13:44.032 --> 13:45.491
Charlie, you're upset.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.994
We have a session tomorrow and
we'll talk about this, so hold that thought.

13:49.078 --> 13:53.499
But right now, hold this
and press the blue button three times.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.293
One, two, three.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.630
Look. She knows what she's doing.
She's only doing this to piss me off.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.340
-Whoa!
-Exactly.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.051
l don't know how far she'll take this.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.135
Are you listening to me?

14:06.221 --> 14:08.138
l can do two things at once.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.724
lf she's doing this just to piss you off,

14:10.808 --> 14:17.648
then the worst thing you can do
is show her you're upset.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.567
Okay, l can't do two things at once.

14:21.319 --> 14:22.319
Okay, you know what?

14:22.403 --> 14:24.571
Just don't do anything
and she'll stop acting crazy.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.990
You're right. She's just trying
to get a reaction out of me.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.451
-l'm not going to feed into that.
-Good.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.787
Now, l need all of your attention.

14:31.871 --> 14:35.415
l just want you
to put all your efforts into pleasing me.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.337
-What? l just push the button again?
-Yeah.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.008
Am l actually a part of this?

14:50.431 --> 14:51.932
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.311
l made breakfast.
l feel bad about yesterday.

14:56.396 --> 15:00.315
lt's all good. You can kick it with Jen.
She's not my bitch no mo'.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.359
She's just my baby mama.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.904
Are you trying to talk black?

15:06.406 --> 15:09.199
A little bit. That's just how Charlie do.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.828
Yeah, well, Charlie don't.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.917
You know, l'm proud of you.

15:19.752 --> 15:24.214
l mean, in group, you tell us
to let go of our anger, and you do it.

15:24.299 --> 15:26.758
-You really walk the walk.
-Thank you.

15:26.843 --> 15:29.386
Because under normal circumstances,
a guy comes into your house,

15:29.470 --> 15:32.180
eats your food, sleeps in your bed,
oils up your ex-wife,

15:32.265 --> 15:34.308
a guy could get pretty upset about that.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.853
-Well, l always say lead by example.
-Yeah.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.772
-Could you pass the butter, please?
-Yeah.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.567
That's my butter!

15:44.444 --> 15:46.570
You didn't ask! You just took it!

15:46.654 --> 15:50.907
And now you're going to smear it
all over your toast right in front of me.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.994
lf you don't want me using your butter,
all you got to do is say so.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.288
l don't want you using my butter.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.416
lt sure seems like a waste of good butter.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.960
We're not talking about butter.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.671
l know, l know, l know.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.342
l'm going to put some honey
on those biscuits. That's cool, right?

16:08.801 --> 16:10.636
Yeah, yeah. Honey is just honey.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.513
-Hey, Charlie.
-Hey.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.600
Hey, boo. Ready to head out to the beach?

16:17.310 --> 16:22.189
Yeah, about that, can l talk to you
out on the porch for a second?

16:23.149 --> 16:24.232
Okay.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.030
Honey and biscuits.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.002
-You son of a bitch!
-What?

16:44.170 --> 16:46.254
You told Derek to stop seeing me.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.424
What do you care? This isn't about Derek.
You're just seeing him to piss me off.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.845
You're so full of yourself, it's unbelievable!
l can't just like him?

16:53.930 --> 16:56.098
-He's a felon.
-He's an ex-felon.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.309
And l'm a 40-year-old single mother
living in Los Angeles.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.144
l had to open up the dating pool.

17:01.229 --> 17:04.314
l now accept bartenders,
pirates, and magicians.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.778
For the record, l was in jail for a long time,
but l earned my GED.

17:09.862 --> 17:14.199
And l'm only two tests away
from being a certified VCR repairman, so...

17:17.078 --> 17:18.120
See?

17:18.204 --> 17:21.748
You always have to control
everything that l do. That's over.

17:21.833 --> 17:26.336
From now on, l'm doing whatever
l want to do and you have no say about it.

17:26.879 --> 17:30.132
-l don't agree with anything you just said.
-And l don't care!

17:30.216 --> 17:32.926
Starting now,
we're just a normal divorced couple.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.010
We're not friends.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.346
When we run into each other at the market,
it's weird.

17:36.431 --> 17:40.100
lf you're five minutes late dropping off Sam,
we've got a problem.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.145
And by the way, Green Goddesses,

17:43.229 --> 17:47.149
the woman who bought the LA franchise
just got a boatload of contracts.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.736
She's cleaning up.
And l meant to say it like that!

17:54.574 --> 17:57.492
You're not supposed to be
friends with your ex-wife anyway.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.453
That's against nature.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.872
l'm not saying it was easy,
but it was definitely worth it.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.874
And as a person, l like Jen.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.834
My ex-wife and l hate each other.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.336
-How about your kids?
-We hate them, too.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.299
What the hell is...

18:13.885 --> 18:16.261
l knew this guy was trouble. Call the police.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.514
Not every black man running
has committed a crime.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.475
They're right behind me! l just stole a car!

18:22.935 --> 18:24.603
You're making me look bad
in front of my friend.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.523
l'm going back to prison, Charlie.
l tried to make it work, but l miss Donovan.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.609
Now l got to go get arrested
in San Bernardino

18:30.693 --> 18:32.027
so l go back to the same prison.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.696
No, this is crazy. What about Jennifer?

18:34.781 --> 18:37.365
Your ex-wife is a beautiful woman,
but it just didn't feel right.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.117
l miss my monster.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.580
l gotta go, Charlie.
l hope you're not disappointed in me.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.333
lt would've been nice if you'd have
made your life work on the outside...

18:46.417 --> 18:49.836
l got very little time
and you're going on a bit here.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.633
l told Jennifer and she's a mess.
You might want to check in on her.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.636
l'll see you next week in group.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.731
That's great.
Now you're here to rub it in my face?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.733
-Jennifer...
-No, no, no. You did it, Charlie.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.027
Once again,
you proved you're smarter than me.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.822
"Smarter than l."

19:18.991 --> 19:21.743
But that doesn't matter.
That's not why l'm here.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.498
What's wrong with me? l just... l can't find it.

19:27.834 --> 19:28.959
What?

19:29.043 --> 19:32.712
-l don't make good decisions.
-Yes, you do. You dumped me.

19:34.340 --> 19:39.010
That was mostly my mom, and my sisters,
a couple of psychics.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.098
Look, you're not the one
who has to change anything.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.600
l think you're right. l do try to control you.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.854
l don't know, maybe it's just my way
of making sure you still need me.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.356
Or maybe you're just a butt-hole.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.569
We can talk semantics all day.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.115
What's important is that we stay friends.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.910
lt's been great for Sam
and it's been great for me.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.788
All right.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.541
-But no more judging, okay?
-You got it.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.669
Now, Hold Onto Your Hat.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.005
What?

20:15.089 --> 20:16.840
No, that's the company name.

20:16.924 --> 20:20.468
lt's a little Velcro strap
that attaches your hat to your collar.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.637
Thousands of hats are lost every year

20:22.722 --> 20:25.849
due to rainstorms, boats,
and amusement park rides.

20:25.933 --> 20:30.937
No one has an exact number, but the
financial loss reaches well into the millions.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.608
What do you think?

20:35.318 --> 20:36.651
l think...

20:36.736 --> 20:38.987
l mean, nobody likes losing a hat.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.698
That's amazing! That's our motto!

20:41.782 --> 20:43.909
"Nobody likes losing a hat."

20:45.244 --> 20:47.203
l can't do it. l'm sorry.

20:47.288 --> 20:51.374
lt's a horrible idea. You'll lose everything.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.043
That was just a test.

20:53.127 --> 20:56.463
-No, it wasn't.
-Okay, l'm into them for $1 ,000.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.883
God, l need help.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.010
lt's okay.

21:02.094 --> 21:06.890
We'll try and find you some kind of
a 1 2-step franchise anonymous program.

21:06.974 --> 21:10.518
-l'll bet there isn't one. We could start that.
-Shut up.
