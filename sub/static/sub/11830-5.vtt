On the charge of first-degree

00:34.573 --> 00:37.143
not guilty by reason
of temporary insanity.

You're filth!

[ Braun ]
I shot him.
And I watched his neck explode.

00:44.751 --> 00:46.386
And it was joyous.

00:46.453 --> 00:49.457
If Gerald Braun came
to you before and said,
"Oh, by the way,

00:49.523 --> 00:53.194
I'm going to kill Ronald
Martin," I hardly think you'd
give him your moral blessing.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.996
Well, you would be wrong,
Mr. Goode.

00:55.063 --> 00:59.334
Because Dr. Braun
did come to me. And I did
give him my blessing.

to commit a homicide.

No comment.

People have dubbed you
the "killer rabbi."
Do you have any reaction?

01:50.327 --> 01:54.364
I'd like to respond.
I think this "killer rabbi"
crap is disgusting.

01:54.431 --> 01:56.767
I mean, if he was black,
you'd just call him "killer."

01:56.834 --> 01:59.537
Or if he were a regular
white guy, you'd say,
"the accused."

01:59.603 --> 02:03.808
But give the guy a yarmulke,
and you all gotta push the
ethnic buttons. It's shameful.

what got you in this trouble

Well, stand right up in court
and say what Daniel said
on the TV show.

06:51.473 --> 06:55.443
It's more right
for Ronald Martin
to be dead than free.

06:55.510 --> 06:57.580
We can't do that.
Of course we can.

can't argue it.

[ Chattering ]

12:37.236 --> 12:40.540
[ Sighs ]
Man, what's taking
so long?

12:40.607 --> 12:43.643
The judge will be
in any second.
The jury will follow.

12:43.710 --> 12:46.146
Let me see the face again.

12:47.882 --> 12:50.819
Good.
Now sit up straight.

12:50.886 --> 12:54.490
Don't scowl, no matter
what the witness says.

12:58.728 --> 13:00.763
Yo, when do I get
to testify?

13:00.830 --> 13:03.633
We'll cross that bridge
when we're drowning.
For now--

13:03.700 --> 13:06.269
[ Man ]
All rise.

13:15.247 --> 13:18.483
I got it.
We got a defense.

13:18.551 --> 13:20.920
Moral justification.

13:20.986 --> 13:24.925
- It's a duress theory.
Little used.
- Moral justification?

13:24.991 --> 13:27.961
Not an absolute defense.
But it can get murder
shot down to manslaughter,

13:28.028 --> 13:30.097
which in this case,
is as good as an acquittal.

13:30.164 --> 13:31.966
What do you mean,
it's "as good
as an acquittal"?

13:32.033 --> 13:35.103
The D.A. is only
charging murder. He's not
charging manslaughter...

13:35.170 --> 13:38.607
in the alternative because
he's afraid if the jury has
that option, they'll jump at it.

13:38.674 --> 13:40.643
Now, I'm confused.

13:40.709 --> 13:43.813
<i>If he gives the jury</i>
<i>the choice between murder</i>
<i>and manslaughter,</i>

13:43.880 --> 13:47.050
he's figuring the jury
will pick manslaughter,
you being sympathetic.

13:47.116 --> 13:51.922
So he takes away that choice
by not charging anything
but murder one or murder two.

13:51.989 --> 13:54.459
He's going all or nothing.

13:54.525 --> 13:57.395
Which means if we can convince
the jury you're only guilty
of manslaughter,

13:57.462 --> 13:59.498
you get
a straight acquittal.

13:59.565 --> 14:01.667
Could they then come back and
charge him with manslaughter?

14:01.733 --> 14:04.136
No. Double jeopardy applies to
lesser included offenses.

14:04.203 --> 14:08.608
They have to charge manslaughter
now, or forever lose it.
Good going, Jimmy.

14:08.675 --> 14:11.244
See, now we got something
to go in there with.

14:11.311 --> 14:14.014
You were acting in the heat
of passion.

14:14.081 --> 14:16.617
<i>The passion was your</i>
<i>sense of moral right.</i>

14:16.684 --> 14:20.021
It's different from
straight jury nullification.
And we can argue that.

14:20.088 --> 14:23.959
Good going, Jimmy.

14:24.026 --> 14:27.963
[ Man ]
I was loading groceries
into my car when he appeared.

14:28.030 --> 14:30.533
He being?
<i>The defendant.</i>

14:30.600 --> 14:33.036
He suddenly had
a knife at my chest,

14:33.103 --> 14:36.673
demanding my watch
and wallet, and saying
that he would kill me.

14:36.740 --> 14:40.344
And then
he lowered the knife
to my groin area.

14:40.412 --> 14:43.715
What happened then?
<i>I gave him my watch</i>
<i>and wallet.</i>

14:43.781 --> 14:47.152
- And then what happened, sir?
- He just ran off.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.488
[ Renee ]
And this all happened
about what time?

14:49.555 --> 14:52.491
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>It was exactly 9:03 p.m.</i>
<i>I looked at my watch,</i>

14:52.559 --> 14:54.528
probably 'cause I knew
I'd never see it again.

14:54.594 --> 14:58.332
And how was the lighting
in this area, Mr. Agosta?
<i>It was very good.</i>

14:58.398 --> 15:01.436
There were lampposts
every four parking spaces.

15:01.502 --> 15:04.272
And five of the eight cars
near to mine were white,

15:04.339 --> 15:06.642
which I'm sure added
to the brightness.

15:06.708 --> 15:09.845
- I got a perfect look at him.
- <i>Now, Mr. Agosta,</i>

15:09.911 --> 15:12.481
did you have an occasion
to see the defendant again?

15:12.548 --> 15:14.751
<i>Yes, I did. The police</i>
<i>responding to my call...</i>

15:14.817 --> 15:19.857
said that a man fitting
the general description had been
picked up about a mile away.

15:19.923 --> 15:25.429
<i>And we drove to the area.</i>
<i>And the police had</i>
<i>that man in detention.</i>

15:25.496 --> 15:27.932
And I identified him
as the man who robbed me.

15:27.999 --> 15:31.837
Now, Mr. Agosta,
can you state with
absolute certainty...

15:31.904 --> 15:35.174
that this man sitting here
at the defense table...

15:35.241 --> 15:37.277
is the same man
that you saw...

15:37.343 --> 15:40.380
on two occasions on the night
of February 12...

15:40.447 --> 15:43.217
and then again in the police
lineup on February 13?

15:43.284 --> 15:45.419
I'm absolutely certain, yes.
That's the man.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.956
Thank you.
I have nothing else.

15:49.023 --> 15:51.159
Your witness.

15:59.068 --> 16:03.440
Mr. Agosta, you seem
to have a pretty good grasp
of the detail.

16:03.507 --> 16:08.413
Well, I'm a photographer
by trade.
So, uh, yeah.

16:08.479 --> 16:10.415
<i>I have a pretty good eye.</i>

16:10.481 --> 16:14.786
I'd say outstanding. You not
only remembered that five
of the eight cars were white,

16:14.853 --> 16:18.557
you even identified the little
trees the suspect hopped through
when he ran away.

16:18.624 --> 16:21.694
Well, yeah.
Like I say, I have
a photographer's eye.

16:21.761 --> 16:23.863
Yes.

16:23.930 --> 16:27.468
But when it came time to
describe the suspect himself,

16:27.535 --> 16:30.638
you said only that it was
a "black man with a big head."

16:30.704 --> 16:32.573
Well, it was him.

16:32.641 --> 16:36.545
You sit here today remembering
the placement of lampposts,

16:36.611 --> 16:39.882
the color of
the surrounding cars,
the exact time to the minute,

16:39.949 --> 16:43.987
but as for what
the suspect looked like,
"black," "big head."

16:44.054 --> 16:47.190
Yes, sir.
As I said, I'm certain
that it was your client.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.493
<i>Mr. Agosta,</i>
<i>were you a little scared,</i>

16:49.560 --> 16:52.263
<i>this knife all of a sudden</i>
<i>being put to your chest?</i>

16:52.329 --> 16:55.633
I was scared, yeah.
But if you're asking...

16:55.700 --> 16:59.404
did it compromise
my powers of observation,
I would honestly say no.

16:59.471 --> 17:01.407
You were looking at the knife,
weren't you?

17:01.474 --> 17:05.344
- I was looking at both
the man and the knife.
- Uh--

17:05.411 --> 17:10.684
Well, for the knife you
remembered "stainless steel,

17:10.750 --> 17:14.320
serrated, wooden handle,
nine inches."

17:14.387 --> 17:16.991
For the man,
"black," "big head."

17:17.058 --> 17:19.627
Look, I'm not gonna say
that I wasn't frightened.

17:19.694 --> 17:21.663
Would you say you were
very frightened?

17:21.730 --> 17:25.601
Very frightened.
Why? You know
you get along.

17:25.666 --> 17:28.069
You've been laughing
and talking on the phone.

17:28.137 --> 17:30.840
Yeah, but he hasn't
seen me yet, Rebecca.
Today he sees me.

17:30.907 --> 17:33.677
Ellenor, you are
a very beautiful woman.

17:33.744 --> 17:37.381
Yeah. Well, maybe
I'm just nervous
about the whole,

17:37.448 --> 17:39.550
you know, eyes
of the beholder thing.

17:39.617 --> 17:42.387
Moral justification?
For a homicide?

17:42.454 --> 17:45.858
- It's different than
jury nullification.
- <i>It's not different.</i>

17:45.925 --> 17:48.528
- He's gonna be arguing--
- I don't have to be
drawing you a map.

17:48.594 --> 17:50.596
Your Honor, I'm bringing this
to your attention now...

17:50.663 --> 17:53.199
so we don't waste time
going back to chambers
once the trial starts.

17:53.266 --> 17:58.005
I'm arguing heat of passion.
The passion can be driven by
a man's moral state of mind.

17:58.072 --> 18:01.576
- That's ridiculous.
- Fine. You make your arguments.
I'll make mine.

18:01.643 --> 18:05.680
Is this why the rabbi is on
the witness list? Is he gonna be
testifying God is on your side?

18:05.747 --> 18:07.850
Whatever he testifies,
you can cross-examine.

18:07.916 --> 18:12.155
Mr. Welk, I seriously
suggest that you charge
manslaughter in the alternative.

18:12.221 --> 18:15.992
Not a chance.
If you don't make
murder two, he walks free.

18:16.059 --> 18:19.629
They're flaunting this.
He planned his crime.
He went home.

18:19.697 --> 18:21.799
He went to discuss it
with his rabbi first.

18:21.866 --> 18:26.604
This wasn't heat of passion.
This was cold, calculated
execution.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.341
Then these people go on
television and exalt it.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.710
This is murder in
the first degree all the way.

18:31.777 --> 18:35.181
- The jury might reject that.
- We're not offering
manslaughter.

18:35.247 --> 18:38.085
This is exciting.

18:38.151 --> 18:41.388
You gotta admit.
Okay.

18:41.455 --> 18:45.193
Somebody is gonna be real
disappointed. Are you still
ready to try this next week?

18:45.259 --> 18:47.729
- Ready.
- Ready.

18:47.796 --> 18:50.165
Ready.

18:50.232 --> 18:52.334
I am.

18:52.401 --> 18:55.137
[ Eugene ] Mr. Agosta,
when the police told you
they might have the guy...

18:55.204 --> 18:58.808
and you got into the squad car
to identify the person they had,

18:58.875 --> 19:01.978
truthfully, you wanted
it to be the man who
robbed you, didn't you?

19:02.045 --> 19:04.281
Of course I did.
I wanted him off the street.

19:04.348 --> 19:08.119
- And I wanted my watch
and wallet back.
- Ah, that's right.

19:08.185 --> 19:11.256
Do you know whether they found
your wallet and watch in
the possession of my client?

19:11.323 --> 19:15.494
- I'm told they didn't.
- What about the stainless steel
serrated knife?

19:15.561 --> 19:17.896
<i>Did that turn up?</i>
I'm told it did not.

19:17.963 --> 19:21.100
When you pulled up to the scene,
where did you see my client?

19:21.167 --> 19:25.372
He was standing between
two uniformed police officers
about 20 feet away.

19:25.439 --> 19:27.374
He was handcuffed?
Yes.

19:27.441 --> 19:31.947
And you said, "That's the man.
That's the man who robbed me,"
right off.

19:32.013 --> 19:34.816
No. No. I got out of the car
and took a close look first.

19:34.883 --> 19:37.586
- You didn't identify him
from the car?
- Nope.

19:37.653 --> 19:41.558
So as you looked at him from
the car standing 20 feet away,
he didn't look familiar?

19:41.624 --> 19:44.261
Well, eh, it looked like
it might be him.

19:44.327 --> 19:47.698
- How so, sir?
- Well,

19:49.800 --> 19:52.871
size and build-wise,
it could've been him.

19:52.937 --> 19:54.739
<i>[ Eugene ]</i>
<i>Size and build?</i>

19:54.806 --> 19:57.542
Ten minutes earlier,
you couldn't give the officers
a size and build description.

19:57.609 --> 20:02.381
Well-- Look, I was still
in shock a little bit.
I'd just been assaulted.

20:02.448 --> 20:05.919
You were in shock? You mean
your powers of observation
might've been affected a little?

20:05.986 --> 20:08.088
Objection.
He's badgering the witness.

20:08.154 --> 20:13.527
- Overruled.
- As you saw this man
standing 20 feet away,

20:13.594 --> 20:16.364
what about him made
you think this is the man
who robbed you, sir?

20:16.431 --> 20:20.068
I don't know.
I just remember thinking
that it might be him.

20:20.135 --> 20:23.038
So that's why I got out of
the car to take a closer look.

20:23.105 --> 20:25.208
And when I saw him up close,
I knew it was him.

20:25.274 --> 20:28.344
- But you couldn't recognize him
from 20 feet away?
- That's right. I said that.

20:28.411 --> 20:32.216
- Asked and answered.
- You couldn't identify
my client from 20 feet away.

20:32.282 --> 20:36.554
- Asked and answered.
- But yet the next day
in a police lineup...

20:36.621 --> 20:39.424
standing 20 feet away,
you did recognize him.

20:39.490 --> 20:41.492
- <i>How is that possible?</i>
- Objection.

20:41.560 --> 20:45.631
- <i>[ Judge ] Overruled.</i>
- Twenty feet away the night
before you can't tell.

20:45.697 --> 20:49.502
Twenty feet away
the following morning,
you pick him out in an instant.

20:49.569 --> 20:53.706
After I saw him
the second time,

20:53.774 --> 20:56.309
there were other characteristics
that registered--

20:56.377 --> 20:59.513
um, build, stance, posture--

20:59.580 --> 21:04.052
Ah! So the next day
when you picked my client
out of a lineup,

21:04.118 --> 21:07.089
you were going
off the things you saw
when he was in police custody?

21:07.156 --> 21:11.394
Well, yes.
Not the things you remembered in
the grocery store parking lot?

21:11.461 --> 21:15.165
By the way, would you
call that a big head?

21:15.231 --> 21:17.701
Well, it seems smaller today.

21:17.768 --> 21:20.905
But you told the police
you were absolutely certain
the suspect had a big head.

21:20.972 --> 21:24.309
- Maybe I was wrong about that.
- Or maybe you were right.

21:24.376 --> 21:28.180
A photographer by trade with
a gift for the detail, maybe it
was somebody with a big head.

21:28.246 --> 21:30.148
- It was him!
- Then you were wrong
about the big head?

21:30.215 --> 21:33.019
- I said I was!
- How could you be wrong about
something so general as that?

21:33.086 --> 21:37.291
I don't know, sir!
As I said before,
I was in some shock.

21:37.357 --> 21:41.228
Oh, yes!
You were in some shock.

21:57.213 --> 21:59.316
What's up?

21:59.382 --> 22:01.785
What's up is
I gotta know something.

22:03.821 --> 22:07.826
What?
When Gerald Braun
came to you,

22:07.892 --> 22:10.529
when he left your office,

22:13.866 --> 22:16.536
did you know
what he was about to do?

22:18.571 --> 22:20.974
Think I wouldn't
have stopped him?

22:21.041 --> 22:23.009
Danny,

22:23.076 --> 22:25.746
did you know?

22:25.812 --> 22:28.282
Of course I didn't know.

22:29.484 --> 22:31.453
I knew he wanted
to kill him.

22:31.519 --> 22:34.322
I never thought
he would actual--

22:36.725 --> 22:39.128
Of course I didn't know.

22:39.195 --> 22:44.668
Then why didn't
you stay with him?
You knew he needed you.

22:48.005 --> 22:50.675
Exactly what's
the accusation here?

22:50.741 --> 22:53.144
Danny, help me out here
a little, please.

22:53.211 --> 22:57.583
Don't you think you gave him
the moral empowerment?

22:57.649 --> 23:01.587
Don't you think you gave him
the righteousness he needed
to see it through?

23:03.490 --> 23:05.792
Let's not kid ourselves.

23:05.858 --> 23:09.196
Ronald Martin is dead
in large part because of you.

23:10.398 --> 23:13.167
I'll ask again.

23:13.234 --> 23:15.203
What's the accusation?

23:15.269 --> 23:19.241
I am walking uphill
into a murder trial that will
be very difficult to win.

23:19.308 --> 23:22.077
I need to know exactly
what I'm dealing with.

23:32.356 --> 23:34.792
Friend to friend,

23:35.927 --> 23:38.396
I don't grieve
for Ronald Martin.

23:40.465 --> 23:45.170
But I never thought
Jerry was about to go off
and actually kill him.

23:52.479 --> 23:54.982
[ Man ]
He appeared to react nervously
to our presence.

23:55.049 --> 23:57.051
Fitting the general description
of the suspect,

23:57.117 --> 24:00.321
we detained him
until the victim arrived,
making a positive I.D.

24:00.388 --> 24:03.391
Thank you, Officer.
No further questions.

24:07.029 --> 24:10.467
He reacted nervously
to your presence.

24:10.533 --> 24:14.337
- You shined your searchlight
right in his face, didn't you?
- We shined it on his person.

24:14.404 --> 24:17.307
Do you think it's unreasonable
for a black man
in South Boston...

24:17.374 --> 24:19.577
to be nervous about
two policemen pulling up...

24:19.643 --> 24:22.747
and illuminating him like a deer
caught in their headlights?

24:22.814 --> 24:26.084
I don't think he had
any reason to be nervous
if he were innocent.

24:26.151 --> 24:29.154
Silly me.
The general description...

24:29.221 --> 24:32.592
you were talking about,
