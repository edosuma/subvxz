being kinda quiet over there.

of a certain night...

forever.

Well, how about you gimme
one little clue?

up at my bachelorette...

set me straight.

He was super cute
and sexy once, okay?

12:16.567 --> 12:18.067

is your deepest...

Are you gonna introduce us
or just stand there?

be Charlotte's sister?

at the concert last week?

No... beef sundae here,

12:41.867 --> 12:43.233

13:03.200 --> 13:05.633
That's a lot of money for a kid.

But if you want to get past
the age of 12-- or 40...

13:16.400 --> 13:18.300
you need to tell me how that
bottle game is rigged.

Okay, people are always so
focused on the bottles...

13:22.633 --> 13:24.900
they forget about the ball.

13:25.067 --> 13:27.133
Ah, have no fear... I get it.

13:27.233 --> 13:29.067
So how's that supposed
to help me win?

13:29.100 --> 13:32.767
No, you idiot, they keep a
weighted ball under the counter.

13:32.867 --> 13:34.933
It's the white one.

you this music note.

13:49.433 --> 13:51.800
Charlotte, you gotta get over
here and try this beef sundae!

13:51.900 --> 13:54.300

about these beef sundaes...
