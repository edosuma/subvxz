WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:04.308
Previously this season
on "Below Deck"...

00:04.352 --> 00:05.657
They're gonna hook up,
straight up.

00:05.701 --> 00:07.311
I think so.

00:07.355 --> 00:08.660
I'm engaged.

00:08.704 --> 00:10.097
You're engaged?

00:10.140 --> 00:12.012
You stuck your tongue
down my throat

00:12.055 --> 00:13.013
and you don't wanna say nothing?

00:14.536 --> 00:16.320
No way, no way!

00:16.364 --> 00:18.322
This Rayna-Jake thing
is gonna be like

00:18.366 --> 00:20.020
a ----ing roller coaster.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.327
This could get messy.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.807
Mwah!

00:31.596 --> 00:33.555
All right, you want me to take
the chips and the crackers up?

00:33.598 --> 00:35.687
Yeah, if you guys wanna take
'em up, that'd be awesome.

00:35.731 --> 00:36.732
Cool.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.344
Did you hear me say,
"Fill the cracker bowl?"

00:40.388 --> 00:41.432
Yeah, five times.

00:41.476 --> 00:42.651
What the [bleep]?

00:42.694 --> 00:44.566
This is the last leg
of the race.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.307
Everyone's tired, and I'm
getting a little frustrated.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.396
We're here.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.665
I said something
I really shouldn't have,

00:56.708 --> 00:58.710
and I really wanna apologize
for that whole situation.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.408
It's okay.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.417
If she wanted to apologize,
she could apologize

01:09.460 --> 01:11.245
- after the sh-- happened.
- Ah!

01:15.553 --> 01:17.512
Last one of the season, kids.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.688
Oh, and they're all
lined up, it's so cool.

01:19.731 --> 01:22.125
They want a jungle safari
beach party on day two.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.735
Awesome.

01:23.779 --> 01:28.349
For dinner requests, a glitz
and glam formal dinner party.

01:28.392 --> 01:31.700
We're all exhausted,
but we've got one more push.

01:31.743 --> 01:33.223
<i>Eddie, Eddie, Heather.</i>

01:33.267 --> 01:35.182
<i>Do you wanna bring</i> <i>
the ice cream</i>

01:35.225 --> 01:36.313
<i>in the next 10 to 15 minutes?</i>

01:36.357 --> 01:38.750
Hey, it's Alexander Hamilton!

01:38.794 --> 01:40.317
Ah!

01:40.361 --> 01:41.797
I brought you ice cream.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.498
What the [bleep]?

01:49.674 --> 01:52.286
Okay, so this is ice cream.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.592
The guests haven't
finished eating.

01:54.636 --> 01:55.593
It's gonna melt.

01:55.637 --> 01:56.638
I need it to go back.

01:56.681 --> 01:57.682
You said 10 minutes.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.162
No, no, no.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.816
We can keep it inside
of the cooler.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.301
Because, like, this
is gonna melt.

02:07.344 --> 02:08.302
Shh.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.782
Jesus ----ing Christ.

02:14.656 --> 02:16.484
Wes, Wes, Eddie, can you
come grab my bow line, please?

02:16.527 --> 02:18.790
I'm sorry... Alexander
Hamilton's bowline, please.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.183
How's it going?

02:20.227 --> 02:21.445
I'll take more lobster.

02:21.489 --> 02:22.620
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

02:22.664 --> 02:23.882
Wassup?

02:30.672 --> 02:32.761
It's just been like [bleep]-it
day from the get-go.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.458
Okay.

02:34.502 --> 02:35.459
I've tried to communicate
as best as I could.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.374
Moving forward.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.463
I can really see the stress
and the pressure's getting to

02:39.507 --> 02:42.640
Rachel, so I'm just trying
to, like, step back,

02:42.684 --> 02:44.903
put my fireproof suit on,

02:44.947 --> 02:46.775
and hope that
I don't go up in flames.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.523
How you doing?

02:55.566 --> 02:57.525
Good.
I'm hanging out.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.182
No, I kinda just finished.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.574
Kaylee is super attractive.

03:03.618 --> 03:06.490
Oh, God, yeah.

03:06.534 --> 03:07.665
Just do some laundry.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.537
Do you need
to wash anything?

03:09.580 --> 03:11.234
Good?

03:11.278 --> 03:14.194
I guess I'm all
about the third stews.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.370
But I miss Jess,
I really do.

03:16.413 --> 03:17.719
I really, really miss Jess.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.592
Yeah, pretty much.

03:28.556 --> 03:29.905
Yeah, I will.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.211
If you don't have
anything else to do.

03:31.254 --> 03:32.342
Okay. Gimme two minutes.

03:32.386 --> 03:33.343
<i>Wes, Wes, Eddie.</i>

03:33.387 --> 03:34.692
Yeah?

03:34.736 --> 03:36.390
Gotta organize the laz and
get everything

03:36.433 --> 03:37.782
<i>kind of cleaned up</i> <i>
before the guests arrive.</i>

03:37.826 --> 03:40.307
<i>Heading down there right now.</i>

03:40.350 --> 03:41.569
Okay.

03:41.612 --> 03:42.961
<i>Never mind.</i>

03:43.005 --> 03:44.441
Goddamn it.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.965
Ugh, not as fun as
I thought it would.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.967
Pardon my reach,

03:49.011 --> 03:49.968
Thank you.

03:50.012 --> 03:50.969
Smells good.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.232
It's passion fruity.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.450
Oh, that's so yummy.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.409
The mint's good with it.

03:58.716 --> 03:59.674
It tastes really good.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.153
Yep.

04:01.197 --> 04:03.547
Mm, so good.

04:03.591 --> 04:06.768
- Caught ya.
- Caught me doing what?

04:06.811 --> 04:08.552
- Cleaning up after yourself.
- Cleaning up after myself?

04:08.596 --> 04:09.945
How dare you!

04:09.988 --> 04:12.774
Sun is yours,
cocktails are still flowing.

04:12.817 --> 04:13.862
That water is amazing.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.559
Yeah.

04:15.603 --> 04:16.560
- Don't miss the opportunity.
- We're going.

04:16.604 --> 04:17.561
We're gonna go.

04:17.605 --> 04:18.649
<i>My Seanna, shore party.</i>

04:18.693 --> 04:20.434
Yeah, go ahead, shore party.

04:20.477 --> 04:22.305
We have our first load ready
for pickup whenever you are.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.915
Copy that,
be there momentarily.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.749
We are not
in California anymore.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.541
All right, let's go.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.760
Guys, we're gonna be leaving in,
like, 30 minutes.

04:42.804 --> 04:46.024
Or as I like to say,
two more drinks.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.504
Oh, God.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.551
I found a sand dollar!

04:50.594 --> 04:52.030
- Ah!
- Yay!

04:54.816 --> 04:56.600
Excuse me.

04:58.559 --> 04:59.516
Yes!

04:59.560 --> 05:00.561
Awoo!

05:00.604 --> 05:02.040
What are you doing after this?

05:02.084 --> 05:03.607
I'm gonna go to
Miami, Fort Lauderdale,

05:03.651 --> 05:05.609
and then I'm gonna check
on the bus.

05:05.653 --> 05:06.610
The bus?

05:06.654 --> 05:07.785
I'm buying a bus.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.004
That'll be cool.

05:12.703 --> 05:13.878
A commer...
in the bus?

05:13.922 --> 05:15.489
Uh-huh, and living quarters.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.317
What size bus is it,
is it a school bus?

05:17.360 --> 05:18.666
A full-size Bluebird.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.669
- A Bluebird?
- Mm-hmm.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.453
I've never spent time
in the U.S.

05:23.497 --> 05:26.804
and traveled and, like, done
a real road trip in the U.S.

05:26.848 --> 05:27.805
That'd be awesome.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.807
Gonna buy a 40-foot bus

05:29.851 --> 05:32.375
so I can hit everybody
I don't like with it.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.638
It's no longer a metaphor.
It's gonna be literal.

05:34.682 --> 05:36.858
Truck-drivin' Rachel.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.426
I'm just headin' South of
mile marker 53, going down 89.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.036
That's so crazy!

05:41.079 --> 05:42.516
Okay, got it.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.996
Oh, God.

05:45.040 --> 05:45.997
Ready to go.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.042
- Yay!
- Yay.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.698
Yes.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.482
This thing is a bitch.

05:52.526 --> 05:53.788
- Good day at the beach?
- Great memory.

05:53.831 --> 05:54.832
That's what I like to hear.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.007
We loved the Hamilton.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.487
I heard he stopped by, yeah.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.840
Hello, welcome back.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.581
There ya go, nice job.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.670
Hope you guys had
a great beach picnic.

06:06.714 --> 06:07.715
That was amazing.

06:07.758 --> 06:08.803
What a day!

06:08.846 --> 06:10.108
To an awesome beach day!

06:12.763 --> 06:14.635
Mm!

06:14.678 --> 06:15.636
We're gonna do the slide now,
how's that sound, y'all?

06:15.679 --> 06:16.680
Copy.

06:18.421 --> 06:19.988
Okay.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.642
Are we deflating her all the
way or just bringing her in?

06:21.685 --> 06:22.643
All the way in.

06:22.686 --> 06:23.905
Get to blowing.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.036
I've never been that
good at blowing.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.392
- You are good at that.
- Thank you.

06:32.435 --> 06:33.393
Enjoy it.

06:34.785 --> 06:35.830
Gonna miss that laugh.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.658
Dinner's at 7:30.

06:37.701 --> 06:40.400
So, this evening I'm thinking
we're gonna do a theme,

06:40.443 --> 06:41.662
Alexander Glamilton.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.533
- Copy.
- All right?

06:43.577 --> 06:46.101
For dessert, I'm gonna try
to make white chocolate domes

06:46.144 --> 06:48.799
or boxes and melt them down.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.192
So, I'm gonna set my box
on fire.

06:51.585 --> 06:54.544
Last slide ever... done.

06:54.588 --> 06:57.417
Ah!

06:57.460 --> 06:58.896
I need to go shower,
but I don't want to.

07:01.769 --> 07:02.726
Where is she now?

07:02.770 --> 07:04.554
She's in Australia.

07:04.598 --> 07:05.773
So, like, when is the next
time you're gonna see her?

07:05.816 --> 07:06.904
She's gonna fly to Miami,
I think.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.471
- Is she?
- Yeah.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.126
Oh, so I got my flights
booked today to Miami.

07:11.169 --> 07:12.780
Gonna do
the eight days' holiday,

07:12.823 --> 07:14.477
and then start
working on that boat.

07:14.521 --> 07:15.522
Oh, really?

07:17.219 --> 07:20.004
I'm thinking of spending
three weeks in Miami.

07:20.048 --> 07:22.572
- That's great.
- Wanna share a hotel?

07:22.616 --> 07:23.573
Get our ----ing hair down.

07:23.617 --> 07:24.922
Yeah, okay.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.446
All right, I'll see
you shortly, bro.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.710
Are we set back there?

07:29.753 --> 07:31.494
Not quite, we got a couple more
things we gotta put away.

07:31.538 --> 07:35.803
This is for captain tomorrow

07:39.676 --> 07:41.199
<i>Eddie, Eddie, Heather,</i> <i>
can you let me know</i>

07:41.243 --> 07:43.550
when you have a quick moment
for yourself and Jake?

07:43.593 --> 07:44.768
I don't like
the sound of that.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.509
Yeah, we got
a moment right now.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.468
Copy, will you gentlemen
meet me in the bridge?

07:48.511 --> 07:49.817
<i>Yeah, copy that.</i>

07:49.860 --> 07:51.471
I'm gonna see what
Heather wants.

07:51.514 --> 07:52.950
She's gonna ask us to
do something stupid.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.169
I'm not gonna ask you
to do anything stupid.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.170
It definitely is.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.214
Look at that smile on your face.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.564
How about this...

07:57.607 --> 07:59.130
how about you both
approach this...

07:59.174 --> 08:00.567
with a little more
open-mindedness?

08:02.264 --> 08:04.005
What do you want?

08:04.048 --> 08:06.877
Per the guests' request,
our Alexander Hamilton theme,

08:06.921 --> 08:10.794
we are requesting to see
Alexander Hamilton be shot.

08:10.838 --> 08:13.014
So, Edward, what I request is
to put on the same outfit

08:13.057 --> 08:14.668
as you wore at the beach,

08:14.711 --> 08:17.540
and Jake, I will give you
one to be Aaron Burr.

08:17.584 --> 08:21.501
And as soon as he goes, "Pow,"
you're gonna go, "Ah!"

08:21.544 --> 08:23.633
The only thing that would
give me pleasure

08:23.677 --> 08:26.549
in seeing Eddie get shot is
if I were the one doing it.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.029
- Do you wanna be Aaron Burr?
- No.

08:28.072 --> 08:31.598
I really don't care for
that kind of shtick.

08:31.641 --> 08:34.165
I think it's
cheesy as

08:34.209 --> 08:36.820
But that's what they want,
and that's what they'll get.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.996
I'm just glad it's not me.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.912
The guests wanna invite you
for dinner at 7:30.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.131
But we're going out with a bang.

08:43.174 --> 08:44.262
Thank you, gentlemen.

08:44.306 --> 08:45.699
I'm too old for this sh--.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.267
--ing hell, man.

08:51.052 --> 08:52.619
Yeah.

08:52.662 --> 08:53.794
I'm on a boat!

08:53.837 --> 08:55.143
Oh, yeah, why did
we not do this?

08:55.186 --> 08:56.536
- I'm on a boat!
- I'm almost done.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.581
- Sweet.
- Beautiful.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.669
Can I get you a
coffee, some tea...

08:59.713 --> 09:00.670
- No.
- Water?

09:00.714 --> 09:01.932
Mm-mmm.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.847
I'm just on, like,
go, go, go mode.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.588
Never forget I'm here to help
you in every way I can.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.981
Okay.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.681
This is the last charter,
and I'm busy as

09:11.725 --> 09:13.857
I can't control my emotions,

09:13.901 --> 09:16.860
so I might feed
on your soul.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.949
Just throwing that out there...
little exhausted.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.300
How's it going?

09:22.344 --> 09:23.867
I literally just went
and tried to have

09:23.911 --> 09:26.696
a chat with her,
and she's so short.

09:26.740 --> 09:29.612
Like, I know it's the last,
but calm the down.

09:30.874 --> 09:34.312
Coming up...

09:34.356 --> 09:35.879
That's what you think.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.577
She's been living with me
for six months.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.579
And you've been
the most rudest to her.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.581
Shut your mouth, Rayna.

09:41.624 --> 09:42.625
- I'm...
- Say it to my face.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.715
Oh sh--.

09:51.242 --> 09:53.418
- You guys going to shower?
- Yep.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.422
Me, too.

09:57.466 --> 09:59.120
It's time to
eat some ----ing steak!

09:59.163 --> 10:00.425
I'm gonna run
downstairs to change.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.253
Copy.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.125
- What do you reckon?
- That's red.

10:04.168 --> 10:06.214
It's raw as anything.

10:06.257 --> 10:07.302
I like it raw.

10:07.345 --> 10:08.738
Yeah, I know you do.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.218
--ing hell.

10:10.261 --> 10:12.524
<i>- Rayna, Rayna, Rachel.</i> <i>
- Go for Rayna.</i>

10:12.568 --> 10:13.525
How long do you
think you'll be?

10:13.569 --> 10:14.701
Five minutes.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.311
Now your life
belongs to Rachel.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.312
Okay!

10:19.183 --> 10:20.576
Let's get changed.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.582
Rachel, I'm here for you

10:26.626 --> 10:28.410
Okay, we're about to go
into silent galley.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.064
No chit-chat, no joking.

10:30.107 --> 10:31.282
- Yes, ma'am.
- I want everything perfect.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.544
Okay.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.242
Let's ----ing make
this our bitch.

10:34.285 --> 10:35.678
Open your lips just a little.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.422
Okay.

10:40.465 --> 10:41.684
But the last one I looked in the
mirror and you guys looked down.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.295
- Oh, my gosh, you guys.
- Hello, beautiful!

10:44.339 --> 10:45.732
Okay, here we go.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.255
- Eddie?
- Yes, sir?

10:47.298 --> 10:49.431
- Black or white?
- White.

10:49.474 --> 10:50.693
Why don't you deliberate
a little bit?

10:50.737 --> 10:52.086
Nope, white.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.610
Hello... look at that hair!

10:54.654 --> 10:56.786
Okay, going into course one.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.617
This looks so amazing,
you guys.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.097
Oh, wow.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.620
Oh, who's that handsome guy?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.491
Good evening,
how's everybody this evening?

11:06.535 --> 11:08.145
- Good.
- Great!

11:09.451 --> 11:11.235
Silent galley, all night.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.457
<i>Captain Lee just sat.</i>

11:15.500 --> 11:17.111
<i>We're ready to go</i> <i>
with the first course.</i>

11:17.154 --> 11:19.200
Some of the kids are
worried that we're bored.

11:19.243 --> 11:20.636
So they're checking in with,
like, "What'd you do today?"

11:20.680 --> 11:22.203
"You've been gone so long."

11:22.246 --> 11:23.770
- We're fine.
- Yeah.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.554
- We're fine.
- We find things.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.865
- The struggle is real.
- Yeah.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.693
- All ready to go.
- Copy that.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.739
Thank you so much.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.654
For your first course,
local-caught grouper

11:38.698 --> 11:40.874
that is a crudo,
done with olive oil pearls,

11:40.917 --> 11:42.832
along with radish sprouts.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.529
- Enjoy.
- Thank you, Rachel.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.401
I love the olive oil balls.

11:46.444 --> 11:47.402
Me too, those are my favorite.

11:47.445 --> 11:48.882
This is delicious.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.797
See, I don't know how you
all eat with chopsticks.

11:50.840 --> 11:51.798
You don't really need it.

11:51.841 --> 11:54.322
Damn good thing.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.453
I know that we're gonna
put everything back

11:55.497 --> 11:56.628
- the way we found it.
- Yeah.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.369
Does that include
the provisions?

11:58.413 --> 11:59.631
Just interior.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.068
All we gotta worry about
is that beer.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.809
Well, you can count
on us for that.

12:02.852 --> 12:05.594
We've got a lot of beers
to drink.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.596
- What can I get you?
- Nothing, I'm good.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.380
Thank you for understanding
that I get quiet.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.382
I love to joke around,
but right now I can't.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.341
I'm tired, and I have
a tendency to cut myself,

12:13.384 --> 12:14.516
fall into things.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.431
- Yeah.
- I'm a little terrified.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.433
I don't wanna say anything,
I don't wanna do anything.

12:22.393 --> 12:25.832
Don't look at her or you'll
turn to stone type of thing.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.834
I just don't wanna
get in her way.

12:27.877 --> 12:30.619
<i>Rachel, I'm gonna go ahead</i> <i>
and clear this course.</i>

12:30.662 --> 12:33.361
Good kids, you have a
lot of good kids here.

12:33.404 --> 12:34.841
I can send some of these back
with you, if you like.

12:34.884 --> 12:36.712
Oh, I'll take the...
no, I would take them home.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.409
All but Rachel.

12:38.453 --> 12:39.759
- But we really want her.
- But that's the one we want.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.717
I may or may not have
almost wet myself.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.589
Yeah, see, for Rachel,
I could get two or three Eddies.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.420
Mm. Goddamn.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.335
Rachel fits the entire
dynamic very well.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.250
Yeah.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.295
What can I get you?

13:01.998 --> 13:03.695
This is kind of irritating me.

13:03.739 --> 13:06.481
I have made it very clear...

13:06.524 --> 13:07.874
please do not socialize
in the galley tonight,

13:07.917 --> 13:10.354
because I cannot focus
on anything else.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.748
Just take the ----ing food up.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.402
That's it.

13:14.445 --> 13:17.579
Need the steak knife.

13:17.622 --> 13:18.841
We're almost done.

13:18.885 --> 13:19.886
We're still gonna
cloche, right?

13:19.929 --> 13:21.801
Goddamn it.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.541
It's not the time, Rachel
doesn't have time for this.

13:23.585 --> 13:24.716
- What?
- Talking.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.935
I'm just trying to focus.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.719
Just go.

13:29.504 --> 13:30.635
Set them on the bar.

13:30.679 --> 13:31.854
- These are hickory.
- Hickory.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.769
We have apple wood
and hickory.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.601
Oh, wow.
Beautiful!

13:39.644 --> 13:43.387
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
you have a Kobe beef filet

13:43.431 --> 13:47.348
smoked in hickory, done with
garlic and pearl onions.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.785
- Yay!
- Oh, how fun is that!

13:49.829 --> 13:51.613
- Oh!
- Whoa!

13:51.656 --> 13:52.919
They executed it perfectly.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.355
But did you see,
even the swirl?

13:54.398 --> 13:55.530
This is perfect.

13:55.573 --> 13:56.618
I can already tell
by how it cuts.

13:56.661 --> 13:57.619
It melts in your mouth.

13:57.662 --> 13:58.750
God, this really sucks.

14:00.317 --> 14:01.492
Do you wanna see your
outfit for tonight?

14:01.536 --> 14:02.842
Okay, let's see my outfit.

14:02.885 --> 14:03.886
You know when Shrek
turns into a human?

14:03.930 --> 14:05.583
Mm-hmm.

14:05.627 --> 14:06.889
That's what he's wearing,
isn't it?

14:10.327 --> 14:11.938
I love presentation.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.809
Presentation is everything,

14:13.853 --> 14:15.898
especially when you
go the extra mile.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.944
So, I'm gonna make
white chocolate boxes

14:17.987 --> 14:19.859
and put the top on it

14:19.902 --> 14:21.643
and then pour some
flaming sh-- on it

14:21.686 --> 14:23.993
and burn it down
and make it amazing.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.734
I hate white chocolate.

14:25.777 --> 14:27.518
Oh, this is great!

14:29.564 --> 14:30.913
Hey, baby!

14:30.957 --> 14:31.958
Hey, baby?

14:32.001 --> 14:33.785
You look ridiculous.

14:37.485 --> 14:38.834
I should have
double-boilered it,

14:38.878 --> 14:40.662
and I didn't do it,
and that was, like,

14:40.705 --> 14:42.838
one of the worst things that
you could have ever have done.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.623
The Goddamn white chocolate
is ----ed.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.843
This is what happens
when I'm distracted,

14:47.887 --> 14:50.367
causing me to lose focus
on what I'm doing.

14:50.411 --> 14:53.109
I'm about to rage and
eat everyone's face off.

15:04.512 --> 15:07.123
I don't care anymore.
They ain't holding up.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.127
I'm done now, Goddamn it.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.389
Just gonna have to improvise.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.566
- Boom!
- Ugh!

15:15.610 --> 15:17.220
Then I...

15:17.264 --> 15:18.569
Or actually I'll use this hand,

15:18.613 --> 15:20.920
just go
squirt with this one.

15:20.963 --> 15:23.096
In the Bahamas, when
I chartered down there,

15:23.139 --> 15:24.488
at the end of every fishing pier

15:24.532 --> 15:26.447
you'll see the
nurse sharks gather.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.231
And they're really
docile creatures.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.929
Mm-hmm.

15:29.972 --> 15:30.973
And to people that have
never seen a shark before...

15:31.017 --> 15:32.322
Oh, yeah.

15:32.366 --> 15:33.933
They're oohing and ahhing
at the sharks,

15:33.976 --> 15:35.325
and you just jump in,
and they just freak.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.503
- That's funny.
- They just lose it.

15:39.547 --> 15:42.071
It would have been fun to do
something nice, but it.

15:42.115 --> 15:44.204
As long as we got the torch,
I don't care.

15:48.469 --> 15:51.254
Do you want me to start
to carry these up?

15:51.298 --> 15:53.430
- All right, cool.
- Oh, my goodness.

15:53.474 --> 15:56.216
Ooh, look at this.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.566
- Ooh!
- Ooh, there it is, there it is.

15:58.609 --> 15:59.567
Look at that color.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.438
- Love it.
- Woohoo!

16:01.482 --> 16:04.964
So, it's a cherries jubilee
with pistachio ice cream...

16:06.052 --> 16:07.053
and...

16:09.272 --> 16:10.230
rum.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.452
Mm, the cherries are fantastic.

16:15.496 --> 16:16.932
If you can't finish it, just
slide it on over here, people.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.064
- Yeah.
- Mm!

16:18.107 --> 16:19.239
This one I think
I can finish, hon.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.110
Yeah, don't even look over here.

16:23.243 --> 16:25.027
And for the grand finale...

16:25.071 --> 16:29.597
- Oh, my God!
- Ah!

16:29.640 --> 16:31.294
I am Alexander Hamilton!

16:31.338 --> 16:33.166
And I am Aaron Burr!

16:35.037 --> 16:39.041
And you are here to witness
the reenactment of the duel!

16:43.611 --> 16:44.568
Bang!

16:44.612 --> 16:47.049
Ah!

16:47.093 --> 16:48.181
No!

16:48.224 --> 16:49.573
Oh, no!

16:49.617 --> 16:51.053
Ah!

16:54.665 --> 16:58.017
- Yay!
- Woohoo!

16:58.060 --> 16:59.931
I still got it.
I still got it.

16:59.975 --> 17:00.889
That was sick.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.499
♪ Duh duh duh duh duh

17:02.543 --> 17:04.284
You all right?

17:04.327 --> 17:05.546
Yeah, I just got a little
ketchup in the eye, you know?

17:05.589 --> 17:07.113
- It's in the wig.
- It stings.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.331
- What a great evening.
- Pretty amazing time.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.419
I have some
captain stuff to do.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.247
Thank you so much.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.162
- Thank you for joining us.
- The pleasure's been mine.

17:13.206 --> 17:14.381
All righty.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.426
We're peaceing out.

17:16.470 --> 17:17.949
Where'd she go,
she's not in here.

17:17.993 --> 17:20.604
But you helped, Rayna,
so thank you.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.302
They're loving it.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.962
I physically don't even wanna
be on a boat with Heather.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.616
I'll never see
eye-to-eye with her.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.315
I'll work with Heather, but
I will never be her friend.

17:35.358 --> 17:36.490
Bye, bitch.

17:40.624 --> 17:41.973
I'm getting old.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.323
The best night ever.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.238
I'm gonna miss those
when I get home.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.022
Keep her on as long.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.023
If she has six hours of sleep,
I'm okay with that.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.416
Mm-hmm.

17:49.459 --> 17:50.982
We're only working
for four hours tomorrow.

17:51.026 --> 17:52.593
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- I'm so ----ing tired.

17:54.421 --> 17:58.294
Jake, how are you feeling after
your performance this evening?

17:58.338 --> 18:01.123
I feel great, I'm gonna get
into acting, I think.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.124
Are you?

18:02.168 --> 18:03.604
No that.

18:03.647 --> 18:04.648
Porn?

18:05.693 --> 18:07.564
Ooh!

18:07.608 --> 18:08.565
You can get... you can make
a lot of money through that.

18:08.609 --> 18:09.653
- Yeah.
- OnlyFans?

18:10.741 --> 18:12.352
- Yeah.
- Moustache.

18:27.062 --> 18:29.369
I literally cannot talk,
because I'm that exhausted.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.117
Yeah.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.683
Prescription for Adderall,
and I'm good to go.

18:39.727 --> 18:40.771
Oh!

18:52.131 --> 18:55.090
Last few hours.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.831
- Last day!
- I know.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.183
I was wondering
why I was melting,

19:01.227 --> 19:02.532
and I didn't quiet know.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.405
Yeah, I know.

19:05.448 --> 19:06.406
And you're like,
"I feel like I'm burning."

19:06.449 --> 19:07.668
The power of Christ compels you!

19:07.711 --> 19:09.148
The power of Christ
compels you!

19:10.366 --> 19:12.325
Mm.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.589
I'm trying to figure
out the best way

19:15.632 --> 19:17.068
to handle this with Rayna.

19:17.112 --> 19:18.461
She doesn't, like, talk me.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.550
You helped, Rayna,
so thank you.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.248
They're loving it.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.472
- Yes, she claims she is.
- Yeah.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.474
I've apologized.

19:31.518 --> 19:34.347
Rayna's told me everything's
good, we're all clear.

19:34.390 --> 19:37.263
So, what am I to do
but take her for her word?

19:37.306 --> 19:39.743
And when she just
ignores me like this,

19:39.787 --> 19:42.137
it's like what am
I supposed to do here?

19:48.622 --> 19:50.363
One of my cardinal rules is

19:50.406 --> 19:53.366
that you always have to have
a plan whenever you dock.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.411
This is your pathway in.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.413
We're gonna pop Eddie's
cherry today.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.285
He's never docked
a boat this big.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.504
I remember the first time
I did it.

20:01.548 --> 20:02.853
Scared the hell outta me.

20:02.897 --> 20:05.116
And you're gonna
start your thrust.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.118
Probably gonna need
number two on your bow.

20:07.162 --> 20:08.119
Mm-hmm.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.599
But I'm excited for him.

20:09.643 --> 20:12.559
He will no longer be
a virgin in that department.

20:12.602 --> 20:13.647
Do not this up.

20:13.690 --> 20:15.301
- Yeah.
- Copy.

20:16.432 --> 20:17.738
Thank you.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.261
Got you some coffee
for your last breakfast.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.523
Thank you.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.308
Your last French toast
of the season.

20:22.351 --> 20:23.570
They've got cottage cheese
on here.

20:23.613 --> 20:24.875
Do you want the pudding?

20:26.312 --> 20:27.617
Best muffin
I ever ate in my life.

20:27.661 --> 20:28.792
Your life?

20:28.836 --> 20:31.142
I am a muffin connoisseur.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.622
ow, take that sh--.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.450
Get it out of my sight.

20:34.494 --> 20:36.713
Don't you lick it.
Don't you lick it.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.367
Thank you.

20:38.411 --> 20:40.369
This is the equivalent
to her Mona Lisa.

20:40.413 --> 20:43.154
First bite of
the Mona Lisa from Rachel.

20:43.198 --> 20:44.460
It's amazing.

20:44.504 --> 20:45.766
It's magic.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.594
This wind is just
off the chizzay.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.204
- So full.
- So great.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.640
I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

20:50.684 --> 20:51.859
Well, we'd probably
better go get packing.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.472
- Loving, loving, loving it.
- Copy.

20:56.516 --> 20:57.952
Deck team, deck team,
change into your whites.

21:01.390 --> 21:02.870
This is a hot mess.

21:02.913 --> 21:06.265
Toot, toot, hot mess express,
first-class ticket.

21:06.308 --> 21:07.266
I love that.

21:07.309 --> 21:08.571
Light 'em up.

21:08.615 --> 21:09.703
All right, go ahead and
start taking her up.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.315
Pulling the hook
for the last time.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.534
Anchor secured.

21:14.577 --> 21:15.926
You're doing the driving.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.667
Why do I feel like
I'm about to give birth?

21:17.711 --> 21:19.190
I don't know, Cap.

21:19.234 --> 21:20.279
That sounds like
a personal problem.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.326
Watch the magic.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.806
It's gonna fit.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.242
We might have to just buy
you another suitcase.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.548
Yeah.

21:33.640 --> 21:34.815
Just making sure that
I can really handle it.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.512
Yeah.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.775
Today is the culmination
of the season for me.

21:38.819 --> 21:42.301
My hands are sweating,
my adrenaline is high.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.867
I'm gonna go out
on the wing station.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.391
- Tell 'em you're doing it.
- Going to wing station.

21:45.434 --> 21:46.392
Obviously, you
don't wanna crash.

21:46.435 --> 21:47.610
That's always a fear.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.308
Make sure you got
your clutches.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.576
- No.
- No?

21:56.619 --> 21:58.795
Engineering, engineering,
we got no bow thruster

21:58.839 --> 22:00.710
on the starboard wing station.

22:00.754 --> 22:04.018
I've got it here, but out
there, Eddie doesn't have it.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.804
Let me double-check.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.893
We got nothing.

22:09.937 --> 22:11.417
Still wanna take it
to the dock?

22:11.460 --> 22:12.809
Not really.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.642
I'm gonna take control in here.

22:19.686 --> 22:20.730
You know, I'm frustrated.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.384
- Sorry, buddy.
- Next time.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.821
The one opportunity that
I finally get to dock the ship,

22:24.865 --> 22:26.345
I'm not gonna
be able to do it?

22:26.388 --> 22:28.651
Like, that's really...
it sucks.

22:31.611 --> 22:32.612
Coming up...

22:32.655 --> 22:33.613
I apologized...

22:33.656 --> 22:34.918
And that's okay.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.355
And you made like
everything was okay.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.356
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.358
Oh sh--.

22:43.492 --> 22:44.406
Still wanna take
it to the dock?

22:54.460 --> 22:56.940
- Ah.
- So, I've pulled that back out.

22:56.984 --> 22:58.899
Port is good, and the
bow thruster's back now.

22:58.942 --> 22:59.900
Thank you very much, Alex.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.118
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.468
Give her another shot, buddy.

23:02.511 --> 23:05.079
All right, deck crew,
we're headed in.

23:05.122 --> 23:07.298
How do you dock
a mega-yacht?

23:07.342 --> 23:08.778
Which way are you going
with your stern?

23:08.822 --> 23:09.779
You're pulling over here.

23:09.823 --> 23:10.998
All fenders are down.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.043
Starboard side, 50 feet
from the marker.

23:13.087 --> 23:16.046
Start thrusting with your bow
so you can straighten it up.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.746
Stop it...

23:19.789 --> 23:21.748
now, go to your wing station.

23:21.791 --> 23:24.011
We are 35 feet from the dock.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.796
Fifteen feet from the dock.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.015
All right, can we get
our lines ashore?

23:28.058 --> 23:29.799
Stern, 10 feet.

23:33.542 --> 23:36.110
That's pretty Goddamn
impressive.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.807
Looks good, Eddie.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.287
<i>Thanks for making it</i> <i>
look good, deck team.</i>

23:39.330 --> 23:41.768
Hell, yeah.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.465
That was easy, Cap.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.077
Smile.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.993
Attention all crew, I need
everybody on the aft deck now.

23:52.082 --> 23:54.302
All right, everybody,
you know the drill.

23:54.345 --> 23:56.086
You guys, it's so sad!

23:56.130 --> 23:58.088
- It was incredible.
- Thank you so much.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.786
See you later,
have a good trip back.

23:59.829 --> 24:01.222
Thank you so much.

24:01.265 --> 24:03.877
It was obviously
the trip of our lifetimes.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.488
Eddie, thanks for the Hamilton
bit, that was so fun.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.011
The highlight of
my thespian career.

24:08.055 --> 24:09.317
And Captain Lee,
we appreciate you very much.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.449
Oh, it's my pleasure.
Thank you.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.015
- Bye.
- We'll be back!

24:12.059 --> 24:13.321
- Safe travels.
- Let's go to work.

24:13.364 --> 24:14.322
Great.

24:14.365 --> 24:15.802
Best trip of my life.

24:15.845 --> 24:16.890
I cannot weigh the amount
of food we had.

24:18.892 --> 24:19.980
I'm getting drunk.

24:20.023 --> 24:21.503
We finished the ----ing season!

24:21.547 --> 24:22.504
We've ----ing done it.

24:25.594 --> 24:26.900
We made it!

24:26.943 --> 24:29.032
Sick!

24:32.558 --> 24:34.211
I'm dead.

24:40.391 --> 24:41.349
Sick.

24:41.392 --> 24:42.916
Let's ----ing do this.

24:45.571 --> 24:48.182
Oh, does it stink down
there, doesn't it?

24:51.533 --> 24:52.882
Crazy bitch!

24:52.926 --> 24:55.842
- Ah!
- Ah!

24:55.885 --> 24:58.366
That sh--'s heavy.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.368
<i>Attention all crew,</i> <i>
I need everybody</i>

25:00.411 --> 25:03.371
in the crew mess for a
tip meeting in 10 minutes.

25:03.414 --> 25:04.981
Okay, finished.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.985
I still think this
is the hot seat.

25:09.029 --> 25:09.986
You're safe there.

25:10.030 --> 25:10.987
Howdy, howdy.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.032
How's everybody doing?

25:12.075 --> 25:13.599
End of the season.

25:13.642 --> 25:15.078
It went pretty good.

25:15.122 --> 25:16.558
Rachel, your food was
over the top.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.081
Thank you.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.430
Eddie, good job bringing
the boat in today.

25:19.474 --> 25:20.867
Thank you.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.564
Heather, you did
a good job this year.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.087
Made my job a lot easier.

25:24.131 --> 25:25.915
Everybody did
a good job this year.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.438
Thank you, Cap.

25:27.482 --> 25:29.092
So, our tip...

25:29.136 --> 25:30.572
17,000.

25:30.616 --> 25:36.099
We did, this year,
147,000 in tips.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.972
- Yay!
- Woo!

25:39.015 --> 25:41.061
So, you guys will be able
to go out tonight

25:41.104 --> 25:42.366
for a little din-din.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.367
Have a good night, guys.

25:43.411 --> 25:44.630
Thanks, Captain.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.980
Thank you, everybody,
for everybody.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.938
- Deck team, knock off.
- We're leaving at 5:00.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.549
Fourteen hundred dollars.

25:50.592 --> 25:53.029
Didn't get yelled at
is a blessing.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.901
Should we go jump off the bow?

25:54.944 --> 25:57.512
It's our last night, so
everyone's absolutely buzzing.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.253
I know it's gonna be
a great night.

25:59.296 --> 26:01.081
We're gonna do cocktail hour.

26:01.124 --> 26:04.345
I'm ready to go, ready to party,
and I can't wait.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.610
Ah!

26:18.577 --> 26:19.578
I'm gonna shower off.

26:22.493 --> 26:23.930
That's as good
as it's gonna get.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.975
♪ He whips his hair
back and forth ♪

26:26.019 --> 26:29.152
♪ Whips his hair back and
forth, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

26:30.327 --> 26:31.590
Woo!

26:33.679 --> 26:35.289
You're beautiful.

26:35.332 --> 26:36.333
All right, guys, let's go
get ----ed up!

26:36.377 --> 26:37.639
Slags!

26:37.683 --> 26:38.640
We'll be going out with
a bang tonight.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.644
All right,
let's get this bottle open.

26:42.688 --> 26:46.082
- That is...
- Tongue!

26:46.126 --> 26:48.084
Go, go!

26:48.128 --> 26:49.390
There it is!

26:49.433 --> 26:50.652
- Oh!
- Ow!

26:50.696 --> 26:51.697
Jesus.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.008
Wow, look at this to your left.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.140
Unbelievable.

27:00.183 --> 27:03.143
I love this.

27:03.186 --> 27:04.971
This place is
absolutely beautiful.

27:05.014 --> 27:08.235
I am so excited finally to
see other parts of the island.

27:08.278 --> 27:10.106
I'm done with the water.

27:10.150 --> 27:11.194
Get me to the jungle, get me
to the mountains, let's go.

27:11.238 --> 27:13.283
Look how gorgeous that is.

27:13.327 --> 27:14.676
This is amazing.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.418
There's a bird, can you
go this way, please?

27:17.461 --> 27:18.637
Watch your step.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.986
- Wow.
- Look at the sunset.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.204
Let's get a picture.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.125
No, I'll do it.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.041
This is very cool,
should we go?

27:32.085 --> 27:33.042
Beautiful.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.304
Want me to get you in?

27:43.226 --> 27:45.489
All right,
let's get ----ed up.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.056
Oh, my God, we are going
through the jungle here.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.536
Can I go in the store?

27:48.579 --> 27:51.408
Oh, is there a store?
More ways to spend money.

27:51.452 --> 27:52.540
Kaylee, sit next to me?

27:52.583 --> 27:53.584
- Can I sit there?
- Yeah.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.195
Welcome to Caribelle Batik.

27:55.238 --> 27:56.544
My name's Nadine,
I'll be your server.

27:56.587 --> 27:57.719
Nice to meet you, Nadine.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.286
Would anyone like a drink?

27:59.329 --> 28:00.722
- Can I please get a lemon drop?
- Sure.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.332
Can we do a whole
round of lemon drops?

28:02.376 --> 28:03.725
Eddie would love one.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.422
Kaylee, you've gotta get
really drunk tonight.

28:05.466 --> 28:06.554
Yeah.

28:06.597 --> 28:07.555
Because we've all been there.

28:07.598 --> 28:08.730
Finish your drink.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.558
Thank you so much.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.473
Mm, delightful.

28:12.516 --> 28:14.388
There are multiple times
this season where I feel

28:14.431 --> 28:16.477
every department leaned
on each other,

28:16.520 --> 28:18.566
and I have to thank each
and every one of you.

28:18.609 --> 28:20.655
No late would be possible
without Jake.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.091
I really, truly,
truly appreciate

28:22.135 --> 28:23.440
all of you and
your help this season.

28:23.484 --> 28:24.615
- So, cheers to that.
- Yes, cheers, everyone.

28:30.709 --> 28:31.797
Shall we take this shot, y'all?

28:36.540 --> 28:37.759
I love Kaylee, I love her.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.326
Yeah.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.596
But I hope you take that lesson
with you on the other yachts.

28:52.469 --> 28:53.601
Because you do.

28:53.644 --> 28:55.124
I agree...

29:05.700 --> 29:08.094
We love Kaylee.
I love you, you know I do.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.269
I love you so much.

29:09.312 --> 29:11.097
All right, well,
somebody ----ing dare me

29:11.140 --> 29:12.751
to do something,
because I'm bored.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.274
I dare you to jump over
that fountain...

29:14.317 --> 29:15.579
- Ooh.
- Naked.

29:15.623 --> 29:16.711
- Nope.
- Nope?

29:16.755 --> 29:18.321
- Oh, my God!
- Fraser.

29:19.801 --> 29:23.370
- No, no, no!
- Oh, no... ah!

29:23.413 --> 29:25.807
- How deep is that?
- It's incredibly deep!

29:25.851 --> 29:27.243
It's like, I can't
touch the bottom deep.

29:27.287 --> 29:29.332
Well, I mean,
can I touch the bottom?

29:29.376 --> 29:31.334
I mean, I am short.

29:31.378 --> 29:32.379
What's wrong, darling?

29:34.337 --> 29:35.556
Like, don't talk to me.
That's how I feel.

29:35.599 --> 29:36.818
I'm buying you a
two-piece outfit.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.124
Oh, thank God,
I need one.

29:38.167 --> 29:39.125
- You wanna?
- Yeah, I need it.

29:39.168 --> 29:40.604
- Come on.
- Okay.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.519
She's just too much, right?
You saw that.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.521
No, I think that she's trying
to be nice, and I feel like...

29:44.565 --> 29:46.349
I get that you have issues.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.830
I will never be friends with a
white person saying

29:48.874 --> 29:50.745
I don't want this
negativity or aggression,

29:50.789 --> 29:51.833
and we need to
have a good night.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.356
And I'm having a great night.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.315
I'm close to both
Rayna and Heather.

29:55.358 --> 30:00.189
But it's very obvious that
Rayna's trying to probe Heather.

30:00.233 --> 30:01.887
She's not nice to her.

30:01.930 --> 30:04.237
And yeah, she has every right
to be pissed off at her,

30:04.280 --> 30:05.716
don't get me wrong.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.545
But we can all be civil
and enjoy this day together.

30:08.589 --> 30:10.721
That's all that I'm asking for.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.816
I'll sit down,
my ass hurts.

30:17.859 --> 30:20.383
Well, well, well,
well, well!

30:20.427 --> 30:21.820
Mr. Miami.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.343
Let's just go back to the yacht.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.518
- All right.
- All right, cheers, guys.

30:24.561 --> 30:25.736
A bitch about to fall asleep.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.738
Fray-Fray.

30:27.782 --> 30:28.739
You're sitting here!

30:28.783 --> 30:29.915
- It's mine.
- Kaylee!

30:29.958 --> 30:31.873
Guys.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.396
I need my sunglasses.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.920
Why are you leaving Wes
alone in the back?

30:34.963 --> 30:36.312
I'll get in the back,
I'll get in the back.

30:36.356 --> 30:37.618
Kaylee.

30:37.661 --> 30:38.924
Okay, let me get my sunglasses.

30:42.231 --> 30:43.580
That's what you think.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.278
She's been living with me
for six months.

30:45.321 --> 30:47.367
And you've been
the most rudest to her.

30:47.410 --> 30:50.326
Shut your mouth, Rayna.
Say it to my face!

30:50.370 --> 30:53.590
Oh sh--.

30:56.202 --> 30:57.203
Okay, let me get my sunglasses.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.686
That's what you think.

31:02.730 --> 31:03.949
She's been living with me
for six months.

31:03.992 --> 31:06.212
And you've been
the most rudest to her.

31:06.255 --> 31:09.868
Shut your mouth, Rayna.
Say it to my face!

31:09.911 --> 31:12.435
Oh sh--.

31:12.479 --> 31:16.135
I don't know why she has
such an attitude with me.

31:16.178 --> 31:20.704
I'm kinda just at a loss here.

31:20.748 --> 31:21.923
I haven't been the rudest
to her, ever.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.272
Really?

31:23.316 --> 31:25.100
You're easy when the doors
are closed,

31:25.144 --> 31:26.885
but when I ask you what's
wrong, you never wanna talk.

31:26.928 --> 31:29.844
Listen, I don't like white
people who say

31:29.888 --> 31:31.890
Hey.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.065
And that's why I don't respect
you, and that's how I feel.

31:33.108 --> 31:34.153
You told me that
everything was okay.

31:34.196 --> 31:35.719
No.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.025
Then why wouldn't
you talk about it?

31:37.069 --> 31:38.244
I'm telling you that
I don't like

31:38.287 --> 31:39.985
white people that say
the N-word.

31:40.028 --> 31:41.290
- Rayna, whatever I said...
- I don't respect you.

31:41.334 --> 31:42.988
I was drunk, and
that's not an excuse.

31:43.031 --> 31:44.337
And I'm on my knees.

31:44.380 --> 31:45.729
No, being drunk
and saying [bleep]...

31:45.773 --> 31:47.470
I am on my knees
asking for forgiveness.

31:47.514 --> 31:50.734
Well, sit on your knees, because
there's no forgiveness there.

31:50.778 --> 31:53.215
Then that's your
own prerogative.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.304
Saying the N-word and
being drunk is not okay.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.741
You can yell and do all
this extra sh-- you want,

31:57.785 --> 31:59.221
but you're the ----ing
chief stew.

31:59.265 --> 32:01.136
And I'm sitting here
not trying to cause a scene,

32:01.180 --> 32:02.398
but guess what you just did?

32:02.442 --> 32:04.923
Caused a scene...

32:04.966 --> 32:06.098
Because I've asked you
to apologize...

32:06.141 --> 32:07.229
You can embarrass yourself.

32:07.273 --> 32:08.317
And you can't be
woman enough...

32:08.361 --> 32:09.318
Why would I apologize?

32:09.362 --> 32:10.754
To see that I wanna support you.

32:10.798 --> 32:12.234
All right, all right.

32:12.278 --> 32:13.757
- If you think that I...
- Why are you yelling, Heather?

32:13.801 --> 32:19.241
If I hear you out,
you get to hear me out.

32:19.285 --> 32:22.288
You don't wanna talk about
it anymore, right?

32:22.331 --> 32:25.508
Heather... come on, don't
get aggressive with me.

32:25.552 --> 32:27.946
I really wasn't expecting
this to come up again.

32:27.989 --> 32:30.774
I've tried so many times to
have these conversations,

32:30.818 --> 32:33.995
and every time I do,
she says everything's okay.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.084
So, I believed what she said.

32:36.128 --> 32:39.261
And I totally understand
from her point of view

32:39.305 --> 32:41.263
why she doesn't
wanna give forgiveness,

32:41.307 --> 32:43.874
and she can never
give forgiveness.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.441
I recognize that.

32:45.485 --> 32:49.358
But I want her to look me
in my eyes and see me,

32:49.402 --> 32:51.534
and not the mistake.

32:58.846 --> 33:00.935
You see how everyone consoles
this ----ing stupid-ass bitch.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.502
All right, all right,
all right, stop.

33:02.545 --> 33:05.287
She admitted to what she said.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.115
She apologizes for it.

33:07.159 --> 33:08.160
It's a fake apology...

33:09.596 --> 33:10.814
It doesn't matter,
she admitted to it.

33:10.858 --> 33:12.033
Yeah, she admitted to it.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.426
Okay.
That's all you need.

33:13.469 --> 33:14.557
Walk the away.

33:14.601 --> 33:16.211
Shut up, you're ----ing Black.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.126
If any ----ing person
would ----ing understand,

33:18.170 --> 33:19.301
it'd be your stupid ass.

33:19.345 --> 33:20.999
You should ----ing understand.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.304
I do understand.

33:22.348 --> 33:23.349
Why should I educate
dumb mother----ers?

33:23.392 --> 33:24.437
Oh, for [bleep]'s sake.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.004
- I do...
- You should understand.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.005
- I do understand.
- Shut the up!

33:27.048 --> 33:28.919
Shut the up, Wes.

33:28.963 --> 33:30.008
I'm not... I'm not gonna shut
the up, because...

33:30.051 --> 33:31.270
Your stupid white ass.

33:31.313 --> 33:32.488
You white, just like these
mother----s ass.

33:32.532 --> 33:34.142
- The one person that you got.
- You...

33:34.186 --> 33:36.014
You're not Black,
though, you're not.

33:36.057 --> 33:38.494
See, get the out.
I don't appreciate that sh--.

33:38.538 --> 33:42.281
Calling me not Black,
it's, like, painful.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.022
You're gonna throw me away,

33:44.065 --> 33:47.068
somebody that has wanted
to help you?

33:47.112 --> 33:48.983
Yeah, I'm deeply hurt
about that.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.598
I'll ride with Rayna,
I can calm her down.

33:55.642 --> 33:57.383
I deserve to be upset.

33:57.426 --> 34:01.169
And I feel bad, because I
feel like I disrespected him.

34:01.213 --> 34:04.042
We're all drunk, and
it's just not the place.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.608
But, like, I've been sitting
here being calm, cool,

34:05.652 --> 34:07.871
and collected this whole season,

34:07.915 --> 34:10.135
trying not to, like,
stir things up,

34:10.178 --> 34:11.527
and not to be, like,
the angry Black person,

34:11.571 --> 34:12.920
but there's only so
much I can handle.

34:18.230 --> 34:21.885
Yeah.

34:21.929 --> 34:24.062
All right, we're gonna
sit together on the way home.

34:29.415 --> 34:30.503
Good night, thank you.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.072
Your shoes are on the
floor here, Eddie.

34:38.946 --> 34:40.643
Oh!

34:40.687 --> 34:43.298
Yeah, I give that a
five, for that mount.

34:47.259 --> 34:48.521
- All right, good night.
- Bye.

34:48.564 --> 34:50.131
Bye.

34:52.002 --> 34:53.352
What do you mean,
"How are we ending it?"

34:56.485 --> 34:58.966
- All right, buddy, sleep tight.
- You too, buddy.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.250
Oh...

35:25.471 --> 35:26.646
I'm ----ing broken.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.604
I am so tired.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.563
Today is the ----ing day.

35:30.606 --> 35:32.434
- Fraser.
- Oh.

35:32.478 --> 35:37.222
I don't even know what
to say about last night.

35:37.265 --> 35:39.441
- How you feeling?
- Good.

35:39.485 --> 35:43.228
Ah, what the
is happening above me?

35:43.271 --> 35:45.317
- Nothing.
- Eww!

35:45.360 --> 35:47.188
What are you doing,
I want out, I want out.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.321
I don't even know where
to begin with packing.

35:52.585 --> 35:56.763
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

35:58.286 --> 36:00.245
What, Wes, what do
you wanna talk about?

36:00.288 --> 36:03.117
I just wanted to say...

36:03.161 --> 36:05.380
yo, not cool,
what you said to me.

36:05.424 --> 36:07.252
I get it.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.732
Like, you are mixed, and your
opinion is valid, I get that.

36:09.776 --> 36:13.171
But I don't need anybody
giving this ho excuses.

36:13.214 --> 36:14.694
I'm sorry, I don't wanna
hear that.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.478
You don't think
I understand, you don't.

36:16.522 --> 36:17.610
No, I don't.

36:17.653 --> 36:19.264
You don't, you really told me.

36:19.307 --> 36:20.308
- Rayna.
- Yes.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.005
I may be from there.

36:22.049 --> 36:24.225
I was brought up in school,
from middle school,

36:24.269 --> 36:26.488
high school, and college,
in the States.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.621
- Okay.
- You don't think I get it?

36:28.664 --> 36:31.101
I don't think you do.

36:31.145 --> 36:32.146
- I wanna smoke a cigarette.
- Wrong.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.411
- I appreciate you so much.
- You too.

36:36.455 --> 36:38.196
You know I get cranky.

36:43.375 --> 36:44.637
All right, I'm outta here.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.247
- You're leaving?
- I am.

36:46.291 --> 36:49.250
How is it already over?
I just got here.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.034
- Love you.
- See you in Florida.

36:51.078 --> 36:52.340
I'm gonna see you, yeah.

36:52.384 --> 36:54.516
After this, I imagine myself
living in a van,

36:54.560 --> 36:56.649
you know, not working.

36:56.692 --> 36:59.129
That is the goal.
#VanLife

37:02.785 --> 37:05.310
- I'm ----ing leaving.
- Wes!

37:08.182 --> 37:10.489
I miss my sailboat,
I really do.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.186
I hope it's not sunk.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.450
I have so much I learned
now to take home to my boat.

37:15.494 --> 37:16.451
Pleasure working
with you, buddy.

37:16.495 --> 37:18.061
Honestly, it was a pleasure.

37:18.105 --> 37:19.498
And also, I'm just
really excited to go

37:19.541 --> 37:20.716
put a hammock up and
just chill the out

37:20.760 --> 37:22.283
for, like, a week.

37:22.327 --> 37:23.458
- I love you, Wes.
- Take care, darlin'.

37:26.374 --> 37:29.203
I'll see you ----ing
slags later!

37:29.247 --> 37:31.292
- Bye!
- Love you, Wes!

37:31.336 --> 37:33.512
- Woo!
- Yeah!

37:35.731 --> 37:38.299
--ing hell, like,
everyone's leaving now.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.258
I'd like to say
it's been a pleasure...

37:42.869 --> 37:44.871
Rachel!
I'm leaving!

38:00.495 --> 38:01.627
Rayna.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.113
- I love you, Eddie.
- Rayna, you made me proud.

38:10.157 --> 38:11.637
Aw.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.552
- You did good, kid.
- You did good, kid.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.336
Do me a favor, get
the outta here.

38:15.380 --> 38:19.340
- Get the outta here!
- Get the outta here!

38:19.384 --> 38:20.820
Bye, Rayna.

38:28.610 --> 38:31.047
Do I think what she
said is okay? No.

38:31.091 --> 38:34.268
But last night, so much liquor
was involved, there's no excuse.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.618
You know, I wish
her nothing but the best,

38:36.662 --> 38:38.707
but I just wanna move past this.

38:38.751 --> 38:41.319
Chef Rayna, cooking up
some sick!

38:41.362 --> 38:43.756
- Chef Rayna!
- Sick!

38:43.799 --> 38:44.974
I don't wanna leave you.

38:49.414 --> 38:50.763
But, like,
you took direction

38:50.806 --> 38:51.764
and you're super focused
about it.

38:51.807 --> 38:53.156
You can see that inside you.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.158
It's really hard to
say bye to Rachel.

38:55.202 --> 38:56.769
Goddamn.

38:56.812 --> 38:59.119
I do see myself
as a chef one day.

38:59.162 --> 39:00.860
It's gonna take time,
but there's no challenge

39:00.903 --> 39:03.645
that I don't feel as if
that I can't get done.

39:03.689 --> 39:06.126
God-the-[bleep]-damn!

39:06.169 --> 39:08.607
I can't see me having a goal
and not accomplishing it.

39:08.650 --> 39:09.782
Sick.

39:09.825 --> 39:10.870
Are you ready?

39:10.913 --> 39:12.219
I'm waiting on you, darling.

39:12.262 --> 39:13.351
--ing legend.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.180
Rache...

39:17.224 --> 39:18.791
- Yeah.
- It's a pleasure.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.314
I'm still waiting to get
the same meal twice.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.185
You never know.

39:22.229 --> 39:24.057
Put that on your résumé.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.364
Thank you, I will.

39:26.407 --> 39:28.017
Put that in your
cloche and smoke it.

39:28.061 --> 39:29.323
I'm gonna miss you.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.020
I think Rachel had
a season of redemption,

39:31.064 --> 39:32.805
if you wanna call it that.

39:32.848 --> 39:36.069
She upped her game, and I
think she did herself proud.

39:36.112 --> 39:37.418
I love working with you.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.333
I'm sure our paths
will cross again.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.204
If you could crawl
inside her mind,

39:41.248 --> 39:43.163
it'd be like a
roller coaster, you know?

39:43.206 --> 39:46.819
It would just scare the hell
out of you, but you like it.

39:46.862 --> 39:49.865
Me and Fras are off now.
We're going to Miami...

39:51.389 --> 39:52.651
Aw!

39:52.694 --> 39:54.217
One last thing, Eddie.

39:54.261 --> 39:55.218
Will do.

39:55.262 --> 39:56.350
Mwah!

39:56.394 --> 39:58.657
Jake is such a strange guy.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.180
He definitely doesn't
give a

40:00.223 --> 40:01.834
He just does
what makes him happy,

40:01.877 --> 40:03.183
and you know, I respect that.

40:03.226 --> 40:06.186
- You're such a weirdo.
- Thank you.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.187
- All right.
- I appreciate that.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.188
- Yeah.
- He's great.

40:08.231 --> 40:09.668
He's my favorite.

40:09.711 --> 40:13.236
I've just got one bag.
Honey!

40:13.280 --> 40:14.760
- You know I've got it for you.
- I know you do.

40:14.803 --> 40:18.372
This season,
I genuinely learned so much

40:18.416 --> 40:20.330
that I can take on more
responsibility now.

40:20.374 --> 40:22.202
I've always wanted
to be a chief.

40:25.248 --> 40:27.860
There's a lot to learn,
still, but I'm ready.

40:27.903 --> 40:29.339
Fingers crossed that
someone will give me

40:29.383 --> 40:32.038
the opportunity one day.

40:32.081 --> 40:33.343
Goodbye, baby girl.

40:33.387 --> 40:36.042
You've been one fat bitch.

40:36.085 --> 40:37.783
Rachel, you ----ing
killed it this season.

40:37.826 --> 40:40.873
Thank you so much.
Oh, almost stepped on your toes.

40:40.916 --> 40:42.135
- I had a great season with you.
- Take care.

40:42.178 --> 40:44.267
Seriously.
Rachel, be safe.

40:44.311 --> 40:45.704
- Bye, Eddie.
- I adore you.

40:45.747 --> 40:48.141
All right, Heather.

40:50.796 --> 40:52.406
I love you so much!

40:52.450 --> 40:54.843
I'm so proud of you.
I will see you later.

40:54.887 --> 40:58.891
- sh-- up!
- sh-- up!

40:58.934 --> 41:00.283
Let's ----ing shake it off!

41:00.327 --> 41:02.503
Ah!

41:02.547 --> 41:04.853
Yachting's always gonna
be a part of my life.

41:04.897 --> 41:07.116
I travel, I have so
much fun on boats.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.989
Oh me running with
a Goddamn chainsaw.

41:10.032 --> 41:14.036
But I can't wait to start
my journey on my bus.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.343
- You got your knives?
- Always ready to cut you.

41:16.386 --> 41:18.258
- I know you are.
- See ya.

41:18.301 --> 41:21.870
And I'm going to be in
a parking lot near you.

41:24.873 --> 41:26.092
We survived.

41:26.135 --> 41:27.963
We did more than that,
we kicked ass.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.443
We kicked ass.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.879
- I'll see you soon.
- Bye, sweetie.

41:30.923 --> 41:32.315
Cheers.

41:32.359 --> 41:34.317
I've had the charter
season of a lifetime.

41:34.361 --> 41:36.189
Aww, Edward.

41:36.232 --> 41:37.756
One epic season.

41:37.799 --> 41:40.019
I feel as if I've grown
a lot as a person,

41:40.062 --> 41:42.108
and I'm looking forward
to the next chance

41:42.151 --> 41:44.806
I get to show up
and be even better.

41:44.850 --> 41:46.286
Cheers to that.

41:48.027 --> 41:49.245
Cap, I'm out.

41:49.289 --> 41:50.769
What's up, Eddie?
Have a seat.

41:50.812 --> 41:51.900
Put your feet up.

41:51.944 --> 41:53.772
Will they reach?

41:56.035 --> 41:57.515
Well, we got through it, buddy.

41:57.558 --> 41:59.299
Yeah, we did, Cap.

41:59.342 --> 42:01.780
You know, it was an interesting
season as my first officer.

42:01.823 --> 42:05.958
Lot of issues going on with
a lot of different people.

42:06.001 --> 42:08.221
I mean, you got out of your
comfort zone a couple of times,

42:08.264 --> 42:09.222
but that was good for you.

42:09.265 --> 42:10.789
Learning experiences.

42:10.832 --> 42:12.225
Hell, yeah, I'm proud of Eddie.

42:12.268 --> 42:14.880
When it's time for me to
hang up my stripes,

42:14.923 --> 42:17.535
I'd love to see Eddie take over
and be the captain one day.

42:17.578 --> 42:19.493
Docked the biggest
boat of my life.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.451
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:21.495 --> 42:23.497
You've done well, grasshopper.

42:25.543 --> 42:26.979
I'm gonna miss you, buddy,
but...

42:27.022 --> 42:28.328
I'll miss you too, Cap.

42:28.371 --> 42:29.329
I'm sure our paths
will cross again.

42:29.372 --> 42:30.983
I'll see you soon.

42:31.026 --> 42:32.898
You know, this was
a difficult season with Lee.

42:32.941 --> 42:34.421
It's always a pleasure
working for you, Cap.

42:34.464 --> 42:37.119
You don't work "for" me,
you work "with" me.

42:37.163 --> 42:38.338
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

42:38.381 --> 42:39.992
Lot of learning.

42:40.035 --> 42:42.342
He challenged me a
lot more in this new position.

42:42.385 --> 42:44.083
Give my best to Mama.

42:44.126 --> 42:45.519
I will, pal, and you take
care of yourself, you hear?

42:45.563 --> 42:46.868
Yeah, you too.

42:46.912 --> 42:48.217
- Take care.
- You too, bud.

42:48.261 --> 42:51.220
But over and all,
love my boat pop-pop.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.574
Gonna miss him.

42:59.272 --> 43:01.970
I guess I'd better
get my ass packed.
