00:04.738 --> 00:06.672
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.674 --> 00:10.743
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.745 --> 00:12.778
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.780 --> 00:15.381
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.383 --> 00:18.017
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:18.019 --> 00:20.219
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.221 --> 00:21.687
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.689 --> 00:23.122
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:23.124 --> 00:25.057
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:25.059 --> 00:26.692
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.061
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.063 --> 00:31.397
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.399 --> 00:33.565
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.567 --> 00:36.101
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:36.103 --> 00:38.604
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.606 --> 00:40.773
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:40.775 --> 00:43.042
(electronic music playing)

00:48.148 --> 00:50.149
(song ends)

00:50.151 --> 00:51.617
(clapping)

00:51.619 --> 00:54.386
I wrote it for you.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.255
It's so beautiful.

01:01.161 --> 01:03.562
I have an electro-plasmic
continuum fingerboard.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.397
Happy helped me build it.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.066
(chuckles)

01:07.068 --> 01:10.102
Does happy know about...

01:10.104 --> 01:12.438
Us? In the broadest of terms.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.274
So pretty much everyone
in the garage but my brother.

01:15.276 --> 01:18.077
You said you want to tell him
yourself, but you know

01:18.079 --> 01:20.079
Walter comes here
every Friday, right?

01:20.081 --> 01:21.613
He sees
one super fun guy comic,

01:21.615 --> 01:24.817
He is going to know that we've
been spending time together.

01:24.819 --> 01:26.785
So I'll just bring them all
to my apartment,

01:26.787 --> 01:29.088
And you can read them there.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.723
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
be leaving here less and less.

01:31.725 --> 01:32.758
I thought
we were thinking positive.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.093
Especially
with walter's research,

01:34.095 --> 01:40.299
This morning I was told
that I won't get my braces off.

01:42.268 --> 01:46.672
I'm never gonna walk
without them again.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.808
I'm never gonna dance again.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.343
Ugh, but, hey...

01:51.345 --> 01:53.679
(sniffles)
I have no time for regrets

01:53.681 --> 01:56.682
And no time for secrets.

01:58.351 --> 02:00.686
Don't be nervous.

02:00.688 --> 02:03.188
He's gonna be fine with it.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.124
You're right.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.326
I will find
the right time and...

02:07.328 --> 02:09.294
I will tell him.

02:11.564 --> 02:14.199
Walter:
Everybody! By the monitors!

02:14.201 --> 02:18.737
Uh, hey...
Yeah, you... You look like
you're about to say something.

02:18.739 --> 02:19.738
No? Okay, great.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.341
Everybody by the monitors.

02:22.343 --> 02:25.544
(news theme playing)

02:25.546 --> 02:27.346
I'm lorraine arroyo.

02:27.348 --> 02:30.449
We had a chance to sit down
with the leader

02:30.451 --> 02:32.918
And founder
of this remarkable team,

02:32.920 --> 02:34.920
Walter o'brien.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.923
That's the garage.
I don't think it's a
coincidence, sylvester.

02:37.925 --> 02:41.226
197 iq,
statistically one of only

02:41.228 --> 02:44.396
Are you just always thinking
of amazing things?

02:44.398 --> 02:46.231
When did you do a tv interview?

02:46.233 --> 02:47.232
Walter:
Well, I'm involved

02:47.234 --> 02:49.234
In many projects simultaneously.

02:49.236 --> 02:51.870
But when I use my intelligence
for the greater good,

02:51.872 --> 02:54.907
That's when I'm most fulfilled.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.709
Arroyo:
This is the dramatic footage

02:57.711 --> 02:59.411
<i>Of walter o'brien</i>
<i>saving the life</i>

02:59.413 --> 03:01.547
<i>Of a young boy who'd been</i>
<i>trapped in a sinkhole</i>

03:01.549 --> 03:03.415
On zuma beach.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.918
I remember
all of us being there.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.320
This is the jack that I used
to free the boy's foot.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.322
The jack I built.
Arroyo:
Is it fair to say

03:10.324 --> 03:12.491
That boy was saved by genius?

03:12.493 --> 03:13.825
Absolutely. (chuckles)

03:13.827 --> 03:16.562
No. He was saved
by four geniuses.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.564
And cabe and paige.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.665
Toby: Is that arm
a little sore

03:19.667 --> 03:22.935
Arroyo: But as brilliant
as he is, o'brien chooses

03:22.937 --> 03:26.638
To surround himself with other
highly gifted intellects.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.707
Less so than himself, of course.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.210
Math whiz sylvester dodd...

03:31.212 --> 03:32.978
Statistical theoretician.
Tobias curtis,

03:32.980 --> 03:34.479
Psychologist...
Toby: Psychiatrist.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.981
Harvard-trained.
Master fabricator

03:35.983 --> 03:38.717
And genius electrical engineer,

03:38.719 --> 03:41.720
Paige dineen; and lastly,

03:41.722 --> 03:44.389
What o'brien termed
the team's supernanny,

03:44.391 --> 03:45.724
Happy quinn.

03:45.726 --> 03:50.529
Pardon me while I go bury
my head in the dirt.

03:50.531 --> 03:53.265
Is it that bad
being mistaken for me?

03:53.267 --> 03:55.534
Although "supernanny" does sound
like I change diapers.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.603
We're gonna be flooded
with work.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.471
Given your astronomical iq,
I didn't think it was necessary

03:59.473 --> 04:01.473
To discuss the difference
between a psychologist

04:01.475 --> 04:03.275
And an m.D.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.277
I told them
you were a psychiatrist

04:05.279 --> 04:06.445
And where
you trained.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.780
It just got lost in translation.

04:08.782 --> 04:09.815
A few things.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.317
(groans)
they're tv reporters.

04:12.319 --> 04:13.819
You have to expect
some mild inaccuracies.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.621
Can no one see the greater good
in this scenario?

04:15.623 --> 04:17.522
It's great for the team.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.825
It's great for you.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.960
Your qualifications
were stated perfectly,

04:21.962 --> 04:25.297
And the entire report was
a firmly gripped stroke

04:25.299 --> 04:27.633
Of your narcissistic egomania.

04:32.305 --> 04:33.438
Paige:
You didn't

04:33.440 --> 04:35.374
Tell them.
You didn't include them.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.875
They only asked to talk to me.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.844
I-I didn't even think
to ask you guys.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.379
Exactly!

04:40.381 --> 04:41.546
A fresh shovelful

04:41.548 --> 04:43.015
Of narcissistic egomania
onto the pile.

04:43.017 --> 04:44.683
I did my job.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.519
I got media coverage
for the team.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.687
This is childish!

04:48.689 --> 04:49.688
Cabe:
Hey!

04:49.690 --> 04:52.357
(sander powers down)

04:53.559 --> 04:54.993
We got a case.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.828
That is richard elia.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.930
Billionaire
tech mogul.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.766
Yeah, I know who he is.

05:00.768 --> 05:05.070
And his first impression
of us is that we're idiots.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.938
Elia:
My daughter zoe.

05:06.940 --> 05:10.509
10 days ago, she was kidnapped
by the la plaga cartel in mexico

05:10.511 --> 05:12.077
While on a journalism
assignment.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.912
They're an emerging drug gang.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.547
Particularly violent.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.748
They've killed before.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.083
They left heads
in the street.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.484
I'm sorry.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.752
They're modern.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.054
Tech savvy.

05:22.056 --> 05:23.855
They like to show off
their exploits-- murders--

05:23.857 --> 05:25.324
To other cartels
via social media.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.792
That's advertising 101.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.594
To make it known that
they mean business.

05:29.596 --> 05:30.762
Publicity whores.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.898
Been seeing a lot
of that lately.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.066
How did an heiress
cross those guys?

05:34.068 --> 05:37.569
It's trite,
but when zoe turned 20,

05:37.571 --> 05:39.705
She started saying that
I was a capitalist fascist

05:39.707 --> 05:42.808
Were the source of
all the world's ills.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.409
And we didn't speak for months.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.844
Ten days ago,
I get a call from her editor

05:45.846 --> 05:47.679
Saying she's down in mexico,

05:47.681 --> 05:50.349
Wants to blow the lid
off this big drug cartel.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.050
You want us to find her?

05:52.052 --> 05:54.086
In drug cartel territory?

05:54.088 --> 05:57.422
There are ongoing,
very sensitive

05:57.424 --> 05:59.791
Border sovereignty talks
between the u.S. And mexico.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.760
The last thing the state wants

06:01.762 --> 06:03.795
Is us sending in a paramilitary
group to rescue a citizen.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.131
Well, they must know
who you are.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.599
They know who zoe is.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.434
There must be a substantial
ransom; pay it.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.370
I did.
Cabe:
$2 million via wire transfer.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.105
As soon as they got it,

06:13.107 --> 06:14.806
They called it a "down payment."

06:14.808 --> 06:15.907
Then this morning,
they reached out

06:15.909 --> 06:17.442
And asked for
another installment,

06:17.444 --> 06:19.411
Due in 10 hours, in cash,

06:19.413 --> 06:22.047
Delivered to coordinates in
the northwest mexican desert.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.716
I've had my best people working
on tracing their communications

06:24.718 --> 06:25.884
And they hit wall

06:25.886 --> 06:26.885
After wall.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.854
But if you can
just locate her,

06:28.856 --> 06:30.689
Even the city that she's in,
I have contractors.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.892
Do you have the, uh,
the wiring instructions

06:33.894 --> 06:35.527
For the ransom money?
Elia:
Yeah.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.528
Can I see it, please?
Thank you.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.829
Sly...
Yeah.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.097
Walter:
If you keep paying it,

06:39.099 --> 06:40.732
They'll probably
string you along,

06:40.734 --> 06:42.167
Providing "proof of life"
videos of zoe

06:42.169 --> 06:43.802
In different clothing
and locations.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.704
They'll probably be taken
over the next few days.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.407
The likelihood is that
she'll be killed within a week--

06:48.409 --> 06:49.908
Keeping a hostage
is a liability.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.912
But there's
no certainty of that.

06:53.914 --> 06:54.913
Yes, of course.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.648
Nothing is, uh, certain.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.816
Sylvester:
I did a sweep

06:57.818 --> 06:58.950
Of mr. Elia's bank

06:58.952 --> 07:00.585
And traced the routing
and re-routing.

07:00.587 --> 07:04.990
The kidnappers made it
bounce between 15 countries,

07:04.992 --> 07:06.758
But I am 97% certain

07:06.760 --> 07:07.859
That your daughter

07:07.861 --> 07:09.628
Is somewhere near
culiacan, mexico.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.929
Oh, my god.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.998
You said they were good.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.499
I'll have my men there
in four hours.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.535
You will be well
compensated for this.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.737
Mr. Elia?

07:18.739 --> 07:20.839
Um...

07:20.841 --> 07:23.575
Will not guarantee
getting your daughter back.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.177
But I may be able to pinpoint

07:25.179 --> 07:26.778
To the location
where she is.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.880
But because of the time crunch,

07:28.882 --> 07:30.749
We'll need to
split up, collect

07:30.751 --> 07:34.019
And then meet up
back in culiacan ourselves.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.855
If you can pinpoint
her location,

07:36.857 --> 07:38.123
I'll double your fee.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.891
Walter, can I have
a second, please?

07:42.862 --> 07:43.862
Toby:
Drug cartel territory?

07:43.864 --> 07:45.864
You trying
to get us decapitated?

07:45.866 --> 07:47.899
Or is this the,
uh, opportunity

07:47.901 --> 07:50.502
To dazzle some deep-pocket
tech mogul with rich friends?

07:50.504 --> 07:51.803
Yeah, this would fit in nicely

07:51.805 --> 07:53.705
To your "pr at all costs"
campaign.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.140
I have a plan; my plans work.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.209
Because time is
of the essence.

07:57.211 --> 07:59.878
The cartel's expecting payment
in a matter of hours.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.948
If you do not want to assist,
it's your decision, toby.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.050
Wow, that's it...
Your way or the highway?

08:06.185 --> 08:10.589
Walter, that was a local
morning news show.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.058
We have to move fast.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.125
What is your answer?

08:14.127 --> 08:16.962
How many jets do you have?

08:16.964 --> 08:18.830
Two.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.065
We'll need them both.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.768
And $2 million, in cash.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.737
â™ª

08:29.175 --> 08:30.876
Please... Don't.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.111
It's just a little sunshine.

08:33.113 --> 08:37.849
It's just a little reminder that
we are 36,000 feet in the air.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.885
Explain how this works again.

08:39.887 --> 08:42.621
Well, these holographic strips

08:42.623 --> 08:45.957
Are a fairly rudimentary
anticounterfeiting measure.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.159
Right now, they are programmed
with information

08:48.161 --> 08:51.596
That only contains
the denomination of the bill.

08:51.598 --> 08:54.199
But these strips,
when originally manufactured,

08:54.201 --> 08:57.836
Had microscopic
solar cells implanted,

08:57.838 --> 09:00.038
So they were charged
and programmed

09:00.040 --> 09:01.873
With gps tracking software.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.208
It was a secret

09:03.210 --> 09:05.777
Government program to
track how money was spent.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.112
We track these strips with gps,

09:07.114 --> 09:08.847
Stick 'em in
elia's cash,

09:08.849 --> 09:10.749
The cartel picks up the money,

09:10.751 --> 09:12.951
And then we've got a shot
to track them back to zoe.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.019
It's a smart
idea, walter.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.921
Butt kiss much?

09:15.923 --> 09:17.856
Walt,

09:17.858 --> 09:21.927
Well, he's the only one
who can requisition the strips

09:21.929 --> 09:23.595
From the treasury department,
happy.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.130
He will meet
us an hour

09:25.132 --> 09:29.634
The mexican federales
will escort us into town.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.603
I can handle whatever comes up.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.972
Even gunfire from drug warlords?

09:33.974 --> 09:36.775
We're not going
to encounter that.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.777
We program the strips;

09:38.779 --> 09:39.878
We implant them
into the money;

09:39.880 --> 09:41.179
And then the professionals
track down

09:41.181 --> 09:42.881
The cartel and rescue zoe.

09:42.883 --> 09:43.882
Done...

09:43.884 --> 09:45.083
And done.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.818
Perfect. Great idea.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.887
I'll be up front.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.189
So I don't barf.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.291
Pilot (over p.A.):
We've started our descent.
Buckle up, everyone,

09:53.293 --> 09:55.026
<i>And we'll be on the ground</i>
<i>in 20 minutes.</i>

09:59.899 --> 10:02.167
La plaga has really been
consolidating their power

10:02.169 --> 10:04.102
Over the past year.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.637
The gang runs rampant

10:05.639 --> 10:06.905
And the population is terrified.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.642
Fantastic.
I would lay low as best you can.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.044
We will not be handling
any of the dangerous

10:13.046 --> 10:14.946
Elements
of this operation.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.815
We'll be in the hotel
most of the time.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.617
Vega:
<i>That's good.</i>

10:18.619 --> 10:19.918
<i>Here we are.</i>

10:20.853 --> 10:22.654
Uh... What is this?

10:22.656 --> 10:23.955
You are ten miles from town.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.190
The bus comes on the hour.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.358
Usually.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.994
Toby:
Uh... Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:28.996 --> 10:30.028
This is crazy.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.931
This uniform puts
a target on my back--

10:32.933 --> 10:33.932
And on yours,

10:33.934 --> 10:35.133
If you are
spotted with me.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.369
Public transportation is safest.

10:37.371 --> 10:38.703
Good luck.

10:41.907 --> 10:44.075
Whoa, ho, hold on.
Hold on.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.410
Okay, okay.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.953
Well, you heard him.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.121
It's safer this way.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.288
Unarmed.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.289
Carrying $2 million in cash.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.391
I'd kill us.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.292
Not to mention,
I didn't get a good vibe

11:01.294 --> 11:02.827
From our escort.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.129
I'm pretty sure I picked up
some deceit leakage.

11:04.131 --> 11:07.999
Yeah, well, I'm picking up
paranoia leakage.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.835
(clears throat)

11:10.837 --> 11:13.972
Looks like things
can't get much worse, huh, boss?

11:15.274 --> 11:17.842
I've been trying to find
the right time

11:17.844 --> 11:20.679
That's an impossible
and inefficient goal.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.946
If you have something to say,

11:21.948 --> 11:23.248
Then say it.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.783
(van approaching)

11:24.785 --> 11:27.152
Guys, I don't think
this is the bus.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.854
Uh, not good.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.024
(men shouting in spanish)

11:33.959 --> 11:36.461
The money! Now!

11:39.031 --> 11:40.298
(men shouting in spanish)

11:49.008 --> 11:51.076
Walter, I'm dating your sister.

12:05.324 --> 12:06.891
Toby: Well, this reporter
is stunned to convey

12:06.893 --> 12:09.427
That in spite of
his stratospheric brilliance,

12:09.429 --> 12:11.896
Walter o'brien managed
to lead team scorpion

12:11.898 --> 12:13.465
Right into a buzz saw.

12:13.467 --> 12:16.134
I have no idea
how they knew we'd be there.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.268
You know that friendly federale

12:17.270 --> 12:18.737
Who was so worried
for our safety?

12:18.739 --> 12:19.838
He got paid off.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.873
(bell dings)

12:21.875 --> 12:23.842
He's upset with me
because of megan.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.377
Or because he just got robbed of
two million dollars at gunpoint.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.013
<i>Si.</i>
<i>A room under o'brien,</i>
<i>por favor.</i>

12:29.015 --> 12:30.482
<i>Un momento.</i>

12:30.484 --> 12:33.885
I did not set up
the federal escort.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.353
We have eight hours
before that money

12:35.355 --> 12:37.956
Is supposed to be delivered,
or zoe's life is over.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.058
So we can fight later?

12:40.060 --> 12:41.793
Tabled for now.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.895
Hey, check it out.

12:43.897 --> 12:44.996
Is that the first thing
you think of

12:44.998 --> 12:46.197
When you think of mexico?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.899
The clock making?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.300
Cabe:
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

12:49.302 --> 12:52.203
I got the gps strips
and wired us up a car.

12:54.907 --> 12:56.207
Why do you all

12:56.209 --> 12:58.276
Look like hell?

12:58.278 --> 12:59.878
Where's the money bag?

13:00.981 --> 13:03.181
You've got to be kidding me.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.949
Your federale, bro.

13:04.951 --> 13:08.253
He's fourth-generation ci,
handed down from homeland.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.888
Right. What department
of government do you work for?

13:09.890 --> 13:11.022
The post office?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.092
Can elia replace the money?

13:14.094 --> 13:15.960
Good luck finding
a bank near here

13:15.962 --> 13:18.296
With two million american
dollars in small bills.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.864
Just got off with elia;
he's devastated,

13:19.866 --> 13:21.232
But I convinced him
we can get it done.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.333
Don't make me a liar.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.501
How are we doing
with the wireless?

13:23.503 --> 13:27.005
He also sent a file
to our secure e-mail.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.306
It's a new video of zoe.
Got it.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.008
Dad...

13:30.010 --> 13:32.343
If the money isn't delivered
to the coordinates

13:32.345 --> 13:34.979
By 6:00 p.M. Tonight...

13:34.981 --> 13:36.080
That's today, in six hours.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.081
We can't get the money in time.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.416
Man: Say it.
No.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.018
Say it.
I won't say that, okay?

13:40.020 --> 13:41.586
He knows what executed means.
I don't need--

13:41.588 --> 13:42.921
Man: Say it, damn it,
or I'll kill you.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.023
(gasps anxiously)

13:45.025 --> 13:47.992
They said they'll send me home
in pieces.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.494
Wait, if we can trace
the point of origin

13:49.496 --> 13:50.595
Of the file they sent elia,

13:50.597 --> 13:52.430
Maybe we'll have the whereabouts

13:52.432 --> 13:54.199
Of their headquarters.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.533
And then we can do the recon.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.868
If we can locate her,

13:56.870 --> 13:58.303
Elia's contractors
can extract her.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.871
They're due here in three hours.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.440
Ah, whatever server
this e-mail was sent from

14:02.442 --> 14:04.342
Has a 30-point encryption
key that changes

14:04.344 --> 14:05.543
Every three minutes.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.045
So somehow we got to come up

14:07.047 --> 14:08.413
With the correct 30 numbers
in three minutes

14:08.415 --> 14:10.348
Or it resets and we start over?

14:10.350 --> 14:13.551
Zoe: I won't say that, okay?
He knows what executed means...

14:13.553 --> 14:16.988
That audio is boring
a slow hole into my brain.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.122
But I...
But nothing.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.224
Please, just change it.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.391
Thank you.
You're right.

14:20.393 --> 14:24.896
He's gonna have to suck it up,
because I know this bird.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.899
Aix sponsa, the wood duck,
here on its winter migration.

14:27.901 --> 14:28.900
Uh-huh.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.602
Well, it feeds on algae

14:30.604 --> 14:32.437
Specific to a shallow marsh,

14:32.439 --> 14:34.873
But average flock size dictates
that the marsh

14:34.875 --> 14:38.543
Needs to be at least 60 hectares
to be a proper feeding ground.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.411
Sylvester, you're insane.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.014
The aix sponsa's feeding ground

14:43.016 --> 14:44.249
Can be as little as 47 hectares.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.383
60 is way on the high side.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.918
You know this bird, too?

14:46.920 --> 14:50.021
The point is how many
shallow marshes

14:50.023 --> 14:51.155
Are there in this general area

14:51.157 --> 14:53.625
Between 47 and 60 hectares.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.226
What we need now

14:55.228 --> 14:56.928
Is satellite imagery.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.897
Enjoy that coattail ride,
o'brien,

14:58.899 --> 15:00.031
Because sly
figured that one out.
Really?

15:00.033 --> 15:01.399
We have six hours to find zoe,

15:01.401 --> 15:03.134
And we're fighting about credit?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.303
Found. Proper size marsh
with adjacent barn.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.273
Let's hit it.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.478
I just spotted

15:13.480 --> 15:15.480
Two sets of fresh tire
tracks heading out.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.515
Most likely a pickup
and minivan.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.083
Cabe:
Could've been a drop-off.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.085
No telling how many people
are inside.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.955
I'll check it out.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.329
It's clear!

15:31.331 --> 15:33.264
Oh, they absolutely shot
the video in here,

15:33.266 --> 15:36.034
Cabe: We gotta come up
with some clue to where

15:36.036 --> 15:37.402
They went, or we're out of here
in two minutes.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.536
Time's wasting.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.376
Happy:
We got nothing out here.

15:47.413 --> 15:50.615
You know, sylvester has every
right to be upset with you,

15:50.617 --> 15:52.617
But you seem upset with him.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.619
He thinks it's because
he's seeing megan.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.088
You're not happy about it?

15:57.090 --> 15:59.290
I'm not pleased.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.995
<i>La fuente de piedra.</i>

16:03.997 --> 16:05.997
The stone fountain, exciting.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.565
No, but it is interesting.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.702
According to local lore, it's
water ran red 200 years ago

16:10.704 --> 16:14.038
When a conquistador drowned
his unfaithful wife here.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.107
Or old clay pipes changed
the water color.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.475
Either way, who cares?

16:21.013 --> 16:24.148
That is the most famous
landmark in the city.

16:24.150 --> 16:28.152
Positioned over zoe's
shoulder in that video.

16:28.154 --> 16:32.023
They wanted us to see it,
but not make it too obvious.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.158
See, not being from here,
we had no idea what it meant.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.660
But after the cartel
screwed elia

16:35.662 --> 16:37.195
With the first ransom payoff,

16:37.197 --> 16:39.230
They must have assumed
he'd hire local mercenaries

16:39.232 --> 16:41.366
To come after them, and they
would know about the fountain.

16:41.368 --> 16:45.136
Why would they lure us here if
they weren't planning an ambush?

16:47.306 --> 16:48.673
You were saying?
Get down! Get down!

16:48.675 --> 16:51.042
(gunshots)

16:51.044 --> 16:52.410
Get down, get down,
get down, get down!

16:52.412 --> 16:54.112
Whoa!

16:54.114 --> 16:56.214
Get down! Get down!

16:56.216 --> 16:58.149
(whimpering)

17:04.490 --> 17:06.124
Okay.

17:06.126 --> 17:10.028
What we're looking at are
motion-activated machine guns,

17:10.030 --> 17:11.095
But we're all behind
stationary objects,

17:11.097 --> 17:14.265
Uh, well, we can't
stay here forever.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.134
If we move, the gun shreds us.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.569
If we stay, whoever's watching
us from those cameras

17:18.571 --> 17:19.804
Will eventually come and get us.

17:19.806 --> 17:20.772
La plaga set the trap.

17:20.774 --> 17:22.540
They saw us here,

17:22.542 --> 17:23.674
Turned on that motion sensor.

17:23.676 --> 17:26.044
Walter, you have a plan yet?

17:26.046 --> 17:27.278
Just don't move; let me think.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.513
Paige:
Okay.

17:36.121 --> 17:38.689
(whimpering)

17:38.691 --> 17:39.724
Paige! Paige!

17:39.726 --> 17:42.060
Oh... Oh, god!

17:42.062 --> 17:44.195
The fan's movement's
drawing fire.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.630
Happy, how long can those drums
provide protection?

17:45.632 --> 17:47.331
That steel's rusting thin.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.266
One minute, tops.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.839
Cabe, can you take out the gun

17:54.841 --> 17:56.074
That covers
our half of the barn?

17:56.076 --> 17:58.543
Shoot-out with a robot gun?

17:58.545 --> 17:59.577
It's rotating

17:59.579 --> 18:00.645
On a gate hinge.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.780
Aim for the lag screw.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.266
She'll be riddled
with bullets in a few seconds!

18:24.636 --> 18:25.870
Paige, on three,
you get up and you run

18:25.872 --> 18:27.605
In a straight line to me, okay?

18:27.607 --> 18:28.639
No, I'm scared.

18:28.641 --> 18:29.807
You should be. One...

18:29.809 --> 18:32.243
Two, three.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.251
Go, go, go!

18:40.253 --> 18:41.419
(groans)

18:41.421 --> 18:42.820
(panting)
ow.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.288
Am I all right?

18:44.290 --> 18:45.490
Well, you are.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.858
I'm not.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.794
Walter:
<i>Okay, what we need to do now</i>

18:49.796 --> 18:51.362
Is carefully assess
our situation.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.830
They clearly know
we're in town,

18:52.832 --> 18:54.165
They know we're coming
after zoe,

18:54.167 --> 18:56.167
So we need to find
a new plan.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.602
Anybody else looking
at the time?

18:57.604 --> 19:00.204
We have two hours until the
money needs to be delivered.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.239
It actually keeps

19:01.241 --> 19:02.440
Pretty good time.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.841
Elia's contractors,

19:03.843 --> 19:06.210
They backed out;
they won't come into the city.

19:06.212 --> 19:08.513
Even armed mercenaries
are afraid of this place?

19:08.515 --> 19:10.414
We have to get her ourselves.

19:10.416 --> 19:11.849
How? We don't have
a location on her.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.284
The welding on
the gun's hinge,

19:13.286 --> 19:15.286
It's smart but rough-hewn.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.721
I'm guessing local work.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.890
How many metal workers are
in this town, you think?

19:18.892 --> 19:22.226
Happy, no one will talk to you.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.561
You want to find someone,

19:23.563 --> 19:25.530
Hit the street,
talk to the people.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.797
I bet you they're
on our side.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.399
They don't want the cartel
on their ass.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.800
I grew up in
neighborhoods like this.

19:29.802 --> 19:32.370
I can handle myself.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.472
No, we stay here.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.240
I will crack the encryption

19:36.242 --> 19:37.942
On the e-mail sent to elia.

19:37.944 --> 19:40.178
We will find her.

19:40.180 --> 19:43.214
In our timeframe,
that's nearly impossible.

19:43.949 --> 19:46.417
There's another e-mail
from elia.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.957
Get down! Get down!

19:52.959 --> 19:55.226
Toby: They were filming us--
the cowering americans.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.628
We unwittingly participated
in an advertisement

19:57.630 --> 19:59.597
For the la plaga cartel.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.465
That was the whole reason
for the setup.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.268
Social media promotion.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.771
Okay, I'm gonna crack the code,
but I need all of your help.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.940
Where's happy? Happy?

20:08.942 --> 20:11.509
(spanish hip-hop playing)

20:13.612 --> 20:15.446
Hola.

20:15.448 --> 20:18.216
Â¿habla ingles?

20:19.484 --> 20:20.952
Do you know who made this?

20:20.954 --> 20:23.221
It's beautiful work.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.365
(man speaking spanish)

20:34.367 --> 20:36.434
(baby crying, dog barking)

20:53.018 --> 20:54.719
Are you kidding me?

20:54.721 --> 20:55.720
Who are you?

20:55.722 --> 20:57.488
A very embarrassed person.

20:57.490 --> 21:00.558
I got kidnapped
by a fourth grader.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.526
Now who in america
is your family?

21:02.528 --> 21:03.894
To pay the ransom.

21:03.896 --> 21:04.795
Ransom?

21:04.797 --> 21:06.530
Like the la plaga cartel.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.933
They kidnap rich americans
and they make millions.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.768
You will get me in good
with them.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.004
I hate to burst
your bubble, kid,

21:13.006 --> 21:16.440
But my dad owns
a failing body shop.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.410
Maybe he can give you
a ratchet set.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.545
This is not funny.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.381
I'll shoot you.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.716
Not with a gun
with no firing pin.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.456
You are clearly a stupid kid,
a wannabe,

21:32.458 --> 21:34.025
But if you move,
it's gonna get ugly.

21:34.027 --> 21:35.593
I'm sorry.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.028
I have no parents, no family.

21:37.030 --> 21:41.032
Believe me, I've never done
anything like this before.

21:41.034 --> 21:42.667
Clearly.

21:44.603 --> 21:45.736
Walter:
I'm up to 16 characters

21:45.738 --> 21:47.471
On the encryption code,
but then...

21:47.473 --> 21:51.075
(sighs)
I run out of time.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.643
Zoe's running out of time.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.378
She's right.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.980
In an hour,
the thugs expect their money.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.648
I'm getting worried.
Where the hell's happy?

21:59.618 --> 22:00.618
Where you been?

22:00.620 --> 22:03.354
I... Got kidnapped.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.855
What?!
Kidnapped by who?

22:04.857 --> 22:07.491
This guy.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.493
He wasn't good at it.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.961
Get in here.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.596
Close the door.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.765
Have a seat.

22:14.767 --> 22:15.933
What were you thinking?

22:15.935 --> 22:17.335
That I could find someone

22:17.337 --> 22:18.636
Who knows the cartel members.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.104
The kid's harmless.
He was just trying to be

22:20.106 --> 22:22.506
One of the big boys,
make a few bucks.

22:22.508 --> 22:23.507
By abducting you.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.009
Does he know
the cartel or no?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.677
He knows the guys who made
that gun for them.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.814
Then bringing a known felon
back-- that was dangerous.

22:29.816 --> 22:30.881
He's a good kid.

22:30.883 --> 22:34.618
There's no way that he will
lead us to whoever has zoe.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.954
Actually, walter...

22:36.956 --> 22:39.690
I don't agree
with that assessment.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.827
Toby:
This groovy little gaming system
is anything but little.

22:42.829 --> 22:44.995
It's tricked out with
voice command capability,

22:44.997 --> 22:46.364
High-def graphics,

22:46.366 --> 22:48.866
Fingerprint
vibration technology

22:48.868 --> 22:50.601
That'll enable you
to feel the kickback

22:50.603 --> 22:52.036
Of any virtual
weapon you fire.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.605
But you can't experience
major league gaming

22:54.607 --> 22:55.773
On a minor league
screen, so...

22:55.775 --> 22:58.476
A high res, 85-inch tv.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.644
All this and more.

23:00.646 --> 23:03.681
This can be yours just for
playing "give up the cartel."

23:04.616 --> 23:05.916
You'll give me this?

23:05.918 --> 23:07.051
Mm-hmm.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.120
Cabe: We got uncle sam's
checkbook, kid.

23:09.122 --> 23:11.655
Just tell us where
the bad guys hang their hat.

23:11.657 --> 23:14.492
Toby:
I know you're torn.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.160
You look up to those guys--
they got cash,

23:16.162 --> 23:17.561
And they grab headlines.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.497
But they do it
in a very evil way.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.665
And deep down, I know you're not
anything like them.

23:22.768 --> 23:24.535
I'm not sure I trust you.

23:27.672 --> 23:29.507
You better be right, doc.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.175
Okay.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.644
You don't trust us.

23:33.646 --> 23:34.812
Here's how much we trust you.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.614
You sit in here
and think it over.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.648
We'll be next door.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.686
We fresco?

23:43.922 --> 23:44.989
<i>Si.</i>

23:59.070 --> 24:00.604
How did it go?

24:00.606 --> 24:01.872
He's considering.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.774
I don't think this'll work.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.877
The genius king
doubts his underlings.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.712
I'm not doubting <i>you, toby.</i>

24:08.714 --> 24:10.448
No. Just my plan.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.183
Aren't you the one who says,
"we are our ideas"?

24:12.185 --> 24:13.751
How about
we all stop fighting?

24:13.753 --> 24:15.085
How about we wait
and see what happens?

24:15.087 --> 24:16.687
I know what
would've happened.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.722
He would've helped without
you bribing him.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.624
You're biased because of your
own oliver twist upbringing.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.026
Besides, what do you know?

24:22.028 --> 24:24.462
According to the news,
you're just our supernanny.

24:24.464 --> 24:25.896
You're playing with fire, doc.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.765
I'll be shocked
if it works.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.800
It astounds me
that I have to remind you all

24:29.802 --> 24:31.235
That I had a medical degree
from harvard

24:31.237 --> 24:32.803
Before most people
have their driver's licenses.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.104
Oh, really?
You went to harvard?

24:34.106 --> 24:38.676
My point is, I am certain
that little urchin next door

24:38.678 --> 24:41.045
Will give us
the information we want.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.781
(door shuts, running footsteps)

24:47.619 --> 24:49.587
He's gone.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.722
And along with all
our I.D.S and our cash.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.591
Told you it'd work.

24:57.062 --> 24:59.196
Little bastard's fast.
He can't wait to give our I.D.S

24:59.198 --> 25:03.167
From his fake gold jewelry
to his knockoff sneakers

25:03.169 --> 25:05.503
That kid is dying to be
something that he's not.

25:05.505 --> 25:06.737
And the best way to do that

25:06.739 --> 25:08.772
Is to curry favor
with the fellas

25:08.774 --> 25:10.074
He so desperately
longs to join.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.142
Walter: The metallic strips
we put in our cash

25:12.144 --> 25:14.612
Are working perfectly--
gps signal is strong.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.514
I can't believe he did this.

25:16.516 --> 25:20.985
Into a tenement
about two miles from here.

25:20.987 --> 25:25.022
Sylvester, can you pull up the
schematics for the building?

25:25.024 --> 25:26.757
You think there are county
registered blueprints

25:26.759 --> 25:29.627
We need to study the layout
of that structure.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.529
Best I can do is bing maps.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.934
Happy: Three stories,
four units per floor.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.669
13,000 square feet, tops.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.538
There's a tricycle
in the courtyard.

25:40.540 --> 25:41.605
There's likely
civilians in there.

25:41.607 --> 25:43.140
And from what I can tell,

25:43.142 --> 25:46.277
Look what is wired
into the side of the building

25:46.279 --> 25:47.311
On the third floor--

25:47.313 --> 25:50.014
Cables for
ambient light sensors.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.182
They got the whole top level
lasered off.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.051
So, if they're all
in their apartment,

25:54.053 --> 25:56.086
They can tell if someone
steps on the floor.

25:56.088 --> 26:00.558
This configuration most likely
leads to a central hallway,

26:00.560 --> 26:02.226
And central hallways
have guards.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.827
We walk around
the wrong corner,

26:03.829 --> 26:05.629
We're dead, and so is zoe.

26:12.837 --> 26:15.306
If we can't see
around the corners,
we'll see through the walls.

26:15.308 --> 26:16.674
Sorry, sylvester.

26:16.676 --> 26:17.341
My souvenir.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.276
Walter:
Your souvenir...

26:19.278 --> 26:21.579
Contains
a light-receiving diode,

26:21.581 --> 26:22.780
So when it's nighttime,

26:22.782 --> 26:25.583
It doesn't chime
and wake everyone up.

26:26.718 --> 26:28.652
We fire a laser pulse

26:28.654 --> 26:30.988
Into the wall
at the end of the hall.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.924
The pulse scatters
in a million directions.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.260
It bounces off
any object around the corner,

26:36.262 --> 26:38.762
Including possibly the guard,
who won't see it

26:38.764 --> 26:40.965
Because it's invisible
to the human eye.

26:40.967 --> 26:43.834
The photons bounce off walls,
all the way back to that diode.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.302
Which will be wired up
to my tablet.

26:45.304 --> 26:48.238
The tablet's camera will
simultaneously send the data

26:48.240 --> 26:50.808
To sylvester's laptop
in the car.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.276
I have to stay
in the car, alone?

26:52.278 --> 26:53.811
Would you rather be
in the building

26:53.813 --> 26:55.079
With the gun-toting
drug dealers?

26:55.081 --> 26:59.316
The laptop will then
read the configuration
of the photon bounceback

26:59.318 --> 27:01.385
And give us a rough image
of what's around the corner.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.254
It's easy,
so long as this diode works.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.956
Cabe: So whether we walk
into an ambush

27:05.958 --> 27:07.625
Depends on the craftsmanship

27:07.627 --> 27:11.028
Of a knock-off
motel cuckoo clock.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.663
Effectively, yeah.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.732
I will also need
some plumbing supplies.

27:16.401 --> 27:18.669
(spanish hip-hop playing)

27:27.412 --> 27:30.414
We're about to enter
three stories,

27:30.416 --> 27:32.349
About half a dozen
cartel members,

27:32.351 --> 27:35.686
A dozen automatic weapons and
a few thousand rounds of ammo.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.021
Not to mention that paco's
already given them

27:37.023 --> 27:38.756
Our names and I.D.S.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.724
Probably already seen this
morning's little news piece

27:40.726 --> 27:42.926
And know exactly
what kind of untrained

27:42.928 --> 27:44.395
Non-mercenaries we are.

27:44.397 --> 27:45.729
(inhales deeply)

27:45.731 --> 27:49.199
Well, no such thing
as bad press, right?

27:49.201 --> 27:51.368
Yeah, well, we don't have
a chance in hell

27:51.370 --> 27:55.305
Forget working together.
We'll have to work magic.

27:55.307 --> 27:56.974
Getting a girl
off the third floor

27:56.976 --> 27:58.742
Without stepping on
the third floor?

27:58.744 --> 28:00.978
I'm still concerned
about the courtyard.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.413
It has
a five-foot retaining wall,

28:02.415 --> 28:04.948
Which could possibly be
trapping us in a death box.

28:04.950 --> 28:06.784
Courtyard is
the only way to do this,

28:06.786 --> 28:08.419
So long as happy
took care of her end.

28:08.421 --> 28:09.420
When have I not?

28:09.422 --> 28:10.454
Happy, don't question walter.

28:10.456 --> 28:11.455
Didn't you see the interview?

28:11.457 --> 28:14.758
Cabe: Damn it! What about
a young girl's life

28:14.760 --> 28:16.060
Isn't registering with you?

28:16.062 --> 28:18.128
You all had ideas on the plan,
it came together,

28:18.130 --> 28:19.830
And now you need to be a team.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.333
We better
get our heads on right,

28:23.335 --> 28:26.870
Or we're not coming
out of that building alive.

28:46.758 --> 28:47.958
Walter:
Yep.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.427
Diode's picking up
the laser bounceback.

28:50.429 --> 28:51.729
(over comm):
Sylvester, you getting this?

28:51.731 --> 28:52.730
Sylvester:
Receiving data now.

28:52.732 --> 28:53.797
Getting an image.

28:54.866 --> 28:57.000
There is a man
around the corner,

28:57.002 --> 28:59.136
Six feet tall,
sitting in a chair,

28:59.138 --> 29:01.071
Two yards in from the corner,

29:01.073 --> 29:03.273
Either a dust buster
or a gun in his lap.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.476
Why would he have a
dust buster, potato head?

29:05.478 --> 29:06.310
Shut it.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.329
Oh, nice.
He'll be out for a while.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.864
(quietly):
I take the east stairwell here.

29:26.866 --> 29:27.998
You take the west.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.166
It's not a dress rehearsal.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.868
Be prepared.
Copy that.

29:30.870 --> 29:31.969
Let's hit it.

29:41.246 --> 29:42.446
Be safe.

29:44.382 --> 29:45.482
You, too.

29:50.489 --> 29:54.491
It's the most popular female
hispanic name last two years.

29:54.493 --> 29:55.559
Roll the dice.

29:59.330 --> 30:01.532
(old woman speaks spanish)

30:37.535 --> 30:38.602
(speaks spanish)

30:45.076 --> 30:46.343
Here goes nothin'.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.477
Hey, scumbags!

31:01.526 --> 31:04.595
(man speaks spanish,
door slams shut)

31:04.597 --> 31:06.597
Okay, he's out in the hall.

31:12.136 --> 31:14.204
I know you're loving this.

31:41.232 --> 31:43.033
Happy! Hurry the hell up!

31:43.035 --> 31:44.034
I'm seriously outmanned!

31:44.036 --> 31:45.602
I'm going as fast as I can.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.646
It's okay-- we're gonna
get you out of here.

32:01.052 --> 32:02.152
Happy? You there?

32:02.154 --> 32:03.287
I lost communication.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.630
While she just
waltzed right in?

32:18.970 --> 32:20.237
You come into our home.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.072
You try to take
what's ours.

32:22.074 --> 32:23.607
Now you're gonna
die with pain.

32:33.151 --> 32:36.119
You need to leave town
as fast as you can.

32:37.055 --> 32:38.155
Now!

32:49.067 --> 32:50.200
(groans)

32:52.538 --> 32:55.672
I can't hold them off
much longer!

32:55.674 --> 32:56.740
Walter, how are you on time?

32:56.742 --> 32:58.275
Because cabe is in big trouble.

32:59.210 --> 33:01.378
Happy, we're almost there.
Status?

33:01.380 --> 33:03.246
I'm dangling a human being
by a bed sheet.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.315
That is my status.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.733
All right, cabe,
we got her-- bug out.

33:31.676 --> 33:34.344
Cabe:
Coming in three, two...!

33:34.346 --> 33:36.380
One!

33:45.356 --> 33:47.257
Everyone okay?

33:47.259 --> 33:48.625
All right,
we gotta hurry.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.160
Sylvester ever
get set up?

33:50.162 --> 33:52.629
Just did it--
I'm on my way to the car!

33:52.631 --> 33:54.297
Okay.

34:02.040 --> 34:06.143
You messed with the wrong
group of people, my friends.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.822
Before you do anything rash,

34:18.824 --> 34:20.323
You should know...

34:20.325 --> 34:23.226
You recognize that gun?

34:23.228 --> 34:26.196
The motion sensor is calibrated
to not shoot anything

34:26.198 --> 34:28.465
Before the door,
but it will take out anything

34:28.467 --> 34:31.735
That moves on the other
side of it.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.504
And fortunately,
that's the side you're on.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.406
Happy:
I improved your gun.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.241
You so much as move
a trigger finger, you're dead.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.643
Lying <i>puta.</i>

34:43.414 --> 34:45.282
I can see you're all scared--
that's good.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.284
It means you won't
do anything stupid.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.086
Like move again.

34:49.088 --> 34:50.687
Cabe: So here's
how this is gonna go down.

34:50.689 --> 34:53.790
My friends and I are gonna walk
zoe right out that door.

34:53.792 --> 34:57.394
And none of you are gonna do
a damn thing about it.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.396
You try to intervene,

34:59.398 --> 35:02.632
It'll be the last thing
you ever do.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.634
Come on.
They can't hurt you.

35:06.137 --> 35:09.539
I've put a 24-hour battery
on the motion sensor,

35:09.541 --> 35:11.208
So, for your sake,

35:11.210 --> 35:13.310
I hope that you
and your men

35:13.312 --> 35:15.612
Are disciplined.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.614
Now remember...

35:17.616 --> 35:19.616
Your nose does not itch.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.617
Walter:
Toby.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.685
Coming.

35:27.325 --> 35:29.259
That was really cool.

35:29.261 --> 35:32.262
We should get a clear
signal in a few miles.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.397
We'll call
your dad, okay?

35:34.399 --> 35:36.733
Thank you.

35:41.372 --> 35:42.873
Stop the car.

35:42.875 --> 35:44.207
What? Why?

35:44.209 --> 35:46.443
Just stop the car up there.

35:53.217 --> 35:55.218
Give me your watch.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.687
This is a $5,000 watch.

35:57.689 --> 36:00.257
From the u.S. Ambassador
to paraguay.

36:00.259 --> 36:02.692
The kid saved my life.

36:11.702 --> 36:14.804
Sell the watch, buy a train
ticket, and move far away.

36:16.374 --> 36:18.441
<i>Gracias.</i>

36:29.854 --> 36:31.955
Okay-- vitals are good,
but you're still dehydrated.

36:31.957 --> 36:34.491
So drink up over
the next few days, okay?

36:36.394 --> 36:38.495
Dad...

36:42.200 --> 36:43.967
(whispering):
I'm sorry.

36:43.969 --> 36:46.203
I'm so sorry
about everything.

36:51.609 --> 36:55.345
Um... We should, uh,
give them a minute.

36:55.347 --> 36:57.714
Can I, uh...

37:02.353 --> 37:04.821
So, um...
Along the, um...

37:04.823 --> 37:07.457
Along the same lines of,
uh, reconciliation,

37:07.459 --> 37:11.861
I wanted to, uh, apologize
for the whole...

37:11.863 --> 37:13.863
Interview thing.

37:13.865 --> 37:16.900
I, uh, should
have made sure

37:16.902 --> 37:18.702
That you were
all included.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.537
Everyone.

37:20.539 --> 37:23.607
Uh... I just
wasn't thinking.

37:25.576 --> 37:28.645
Distance between family
is never good.

37:28.647 --> 37:31.748
I don't like fighting
with you guys.

37:31.750 --> 37:35.752
Yeah, I'm sorry
I was such a pip.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.420
Ditto.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.489
If we don't look out
for each other, who will?

37:39.491 --> 37:41.324
Right?

37:41.326 --> 37:43.693
I wasn't really fighting
with anybody, so I'm not sorry.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.963
But I'm glad
everyone's made up.

37:49.467 --> 37:50.767
Uh...

37:50.769 --> 37:53.303
That was evolved of you.

37:53.305 --> 37:55.438
So while you're in the spirit,
go talk to sylvester.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.307
Please--
he's dying inside.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.478
Hey.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.285
Why aren't I good
enough for your sister?

38:08.287 --> 38:10.520
I know the obvious--

38:10.522 --> 38:13.490
My stress, my anxiety, but...

38:13.492 --> 38:14.958
I'm a good person.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.527
Good should count
for something.

38:18.496 --> 38:20.497
It hurts me.

38:20.499 --> 38:24.367
Sylvester, you are, uh,
kind and generous

38:24.369 --> 38:27.904
And a better human being
than I will ever be.

38:29.507 --> 38:33.376
But I have spent a long time
preparing myself

38:33.378 --> 38:35.879
For the fact that megan
will very likely die.

38:35.881 --> 38:39.516
My research isn't going
as fast as I had hoped for.

38:39.518 --> 38:42.385
And I don't know
if I can save her.

38:42.387 --> 38:44.521
Now, I can handle
the fallout.

38:44.523 --> 38:47.757
But you are not designed

38:47.759 --> 38:50.527
To process the pain

38:50.529 --> 38:52.529
That you're gonna feel.

38:52.531 --> 38:55.532
Getting close to her
is-is dangerous.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.100
For you.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.369
But she calms me, walter.

39:01.772 --> 39:03.840
She makes me feel
good about myself.

39:07.445 --> 39:10.780
And I know there's risk.

39:10.782 --> 39:13.616
But if there's one thing that's
worth the risk, it's her.

39:16.587 --> 39:18.855
I'm glad she's found
such a good guy.

39:19.890 --> 39:21.124
Oh, okay.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.560
All right, buddy.

39:32.436 --> 39:34.437
Hey.

39:34.439 --> 39:35.905
Sylvester,
what are you doing here?

39:35.907 --> 39:37.974
I got you something.

39:39.577 --> 39:40.910
It's a cuckoo.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.846
Slightly used.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.814
Megan: (giggles)
I love it.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.484
It's very subdued.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.586
(funk music plays)
what are you doing?

39:50.554 --> 39:52.021
You like to dance.

39:52.023 --> 39:55.525
So I would be honored
if you would dance with me.

39:57.595 --> 39:58.895
â™ª

39:58.897 --> 39:59.996
(laughs)

39:59.998 --> 40:00.997
Love those moves.

40:00.999 --> 40:01.998
Oh, yeah.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.867
Get up on this.

40:03.869 --> 40:04.968
Sly, I can't.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.035
Yeah, you can-- come on.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.537
Sly, I can't.

40:07.539 --> 40:08.538
Come on.

40:08.540 --> 40:09.839
I can't.

40:09.841 --> 40:12.008
Put your feet on my feet.

40:25.489 --> 40:26.623
Oh, god.
I got you.

40:26.625 --> 40:29.492
Hey, hey.

40:29.494 --> 40:30.527
Hey.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.595
I'll support you.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.601
(laughs)

40:47.077 --> 40:49.112
(same music plays)

40:59.590 --> 41:02.459
I just want to
thank you...

41:02.461 --> 41:04.093
Again, before we leave.

41:05.596 --> 41:07.597
Of course.

41:09.934 --> 41:11.935
So what's all this?

41:11.937 --> 41:15.104
I'm working toward
the kÃ¡rmÃ¡n line prize.

41:15.106 --> 41:19.709
$15 million award for
aerospace development.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.711
I actually know the
anonymous benefactor.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.713
I'm on his board.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.715
I can put in a good word.

41:25.717 --> 41:26.850
Oh, I appreciate it.

41:26.852 --> 41:31.154
I'd-I'd prefer to win
fair and square.

41:32.790 --> 41:35.658
That shows integrity.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.894
How'd you like to come
work at my think tank?

41:37.896 --> 41:42.632
State-of-the-art equipment,
world-class labs.

41:42.634 --> 41:44.934
I'd be insane not to try
and bring you in.

41:48.906 --> 41:51.608
That's an incredible
offer, mr. Elia.

41:51.610 --> 41:54.677
â™ª
(chattering happily)

41:59.717 --> 42:01.584
I'm happy here.

42:01.586 --> 42:02.719
Okay.

42:02.721 --> 42:04.721
But please think
about it a spell,

42:04.723 --> 42:06.723
Because you never know--

42:06.725 --> 42:08.958
Maybe you could
be even happier.

42:14.899 --> 42:16.933
Thank you.
