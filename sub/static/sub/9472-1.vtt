00:08.548 --> 00:11.966
This week on VICE, Boko
Haram's campaign of terror

00:12.102 --> 00:14.051
spreads across Africa.

00:14.137 --> 00:15.887
(men shouting)

00:20.643 --> 00:22.810
Behind me is a compound

00:22.946 --> 00:25.062
which two days ago was the site

00:25.148 --> 00:26.981
of a suicide attack.

00:27.066 --> 00:29.317
And then, advances
with our genetic code

00:29.452 --> 00:33.287
are changing the future
of human evolution.

00:33.373 --> 00:35.823
We're at the National Resource
Center for Mutant Mice.

00:35.959 --> 00:39.160
<i>They're editing</i>
<i>the mouse embryos right here.</i>

00:39.295 --> 00:41.045
The couple wants
a baby with blue eyes.

00:41.164 --> 00:42.663
<i>They said, "Can we get a boy,</i>

00:42.749 --> 00:44.632
<i>and can the boy have</i>
<i>blue eyes?"</i>

00:50.590 --> 00:51.923

01:06.022 --> 01:08.489
The deadliest terror group
in the world today

01:08.575 --> 01:10.491
isn't ISIS or Al Qaeda.

01:10.577 --> 01:12.410
According to a recent report,

01:12.529 --> 01:15.696
it's the Nigerian
terrorist group Boko Haram.

01:15.832 --> 01:18.699
And even after six years
of war with the military,

01:18.835 --> 01:21.369
Boko Haram is as deadly as ever,

01:21.454 --> 01:23.287
finding new ways to implement

01:23.373 --> 01:25.790
their terror tactics
in the region.

01:34.434 --> 01:36.350
This pile of rubble
that I'm standing on

01:36.436 --> 01:39.303
was Mohammed Yusuf, the founder
of Boko Haram's mosque.

01:39.389 --> 01:40.805
Book Haram began

01:40.890 --> 01:43.891
right here at this very spot
as a religious movement.

01:44.027 --> 01:46.694
<i>Yusuf preached</i>
<i>hard-line Islam.</i>

01:46.779 --> 01:49.230
<i>The name "Boko Haram"</i>
<i>roughly translates</i>

01:49.315 --> 01:51.065
<i>to "Western education</i>
<i>is sinful."</i>

01:51.201 --> 01:53.067
<i>But he was also</i>
<i>an outspoken critic</i>

01:53.152 --> 01:56.604
<i>of government corruption</i>
<i>and was accused of leading</i>

01:56.706 --> 01:59.207
<i>violent attacks</i>
<i>against authorities.</i>

02:06.799 --> 02:10.918
<i>The police executed him</i>
<i>without trial in 2009.</i>

02:11.054 --> 02:13.170
<i>I wanted to get</i>
<i>the government's perspective</i>

02:13.256 --> 02:16.057
<i>on how Yusuf's death contributed
to Boko Haram's rise,</i>

02:16.142 --> 02:18.092
<i>so we spoke</i>
<i>to Nigeria's president</i>

02:18.228 --> 02:20.928
<i>Muhammadu Buhari.</i>

02:21.064 --> 02:24.065
(speaking English)

02:41.417 --> 02:44.535
<i>Boko Haram's new leader,</i>
<i>Abubakar Shekau,</i>

02:44.621 --> 02:47.872
<i>used that sense of injustice</i>
<i>to transform the group</i>

02:47.957 --> 02:50.341
<i>into a fearsome</i>
<i>paramilitary force</i>

02:50.460 --> 02:52.960
<i>that in 2015 controlled</i>

02:53.046 --> 02:57.131
<i>thousands of square miles</i>
<i>of Nigerian territory.</i>

02:57.267 --> 02:59.800
<i>When I reported on this
story in March last year,</i>

02:59.886 --> 03:02.436
<i>the Nigerian army was</i>
<i>engaged in a full-scale</i>

03:02.522 --> 03:05.439
<i>military campaign</i>
<i>against the group.</i>

03:13.032 --> 03:16.150
<i>Since that report, Boko
Haram has gone underground,</i>

03:16.235 --> 03:19.120
<i>embracing terrorist</i>
<i>guerrilla tactics instead.</i>

03:19.205 --> 03:22.623
<i>In 2015, thousands</i>
<i>of more people died</i>

03:22.709 --> 03:25.326
<i>in more than 230 attacks.</i>

03:25.461 --> 03:27.161
<i>So I went back to Nigeria</i>

03:27.297 --> 03:29.580
<i>to see how the face of
this conflict has changed.</i>

03:29.666 --> 03:31.499
<i>I spoke to Kashim Shettima,</i>

03:31.634 --> 03:35.469
<i>the governor</i>
<i>of the hardest-hit state.</i>

03:35.555 --> 03:38.389
How do you categorize
how the war,

03:38.508 --> 03:40.591
or the conflict, is progressing?

03:40.677 --> 03:43.477
(speaking English)

04:05.201 --> 04:07.084
Kaj Larsen:
<i>But that's a daunting task,</i>

04:07.203 --> 04:09.337
<i>considering how difficult</i>
<i>it is to figure out</i>

04:09.372 --> 04:11.622
<i>who actually is Boko Haram.</i>

04:11.708 --> 04:14.792
I'm in this heavily armed
convoy of about 30 vehicles,

04:14.877 --> 04:17.043
including an armored
personnel carrier.

04:17.180 --> 04:19.012
And this road, which has been

04:19.098 --> 04:21.048
frequently attacked
by the insurgents,

04:21.134 --> 04:23.050
leads to the Sambisa Forest.

04:23.136 --> 04:27.104
Sambisa Forest is the last known
stronghold of Boko Haram.

04:27.223 --> 04:29.056
<i>The governor had come</i>
<i>to this village,</i>

04:29.192 --> 04:31.058
<i>newly recaptured</i>
<i>from Boko Haram,</i>

04:31.194 --> 04:33.144
<i>to calm the local population.</i>

04:33.229 --> 04:34.695
<i>But the residents here</i>

04:34.781 --> 04:37.198
<i>had already taken matters</i>
<i>into their own hands.</i>

04:37.283 --> 04:39.400
(men shouting)

04:39.535 --> 04:42.703
I heard that they arrested four
Boko Haram in this village.

04:42.789 --> 04:45.039
They've put them,
like, on parade.

04:46.709 --> 04:48.292
What's wrong with these guys?

04:48.411 --> 04:50.327
What's wrong with his friends?

05:02.725 --> 05:04.925
Tell me about these guys.
Who are these guys?

05:06.896 --> 05:08.979
Why did they come?

05:13.352 --> 05:15.236
Larsen:
One of the key elements

05:15.321 --> 05:17.271
of fighting this
counter-insurgency

05:17.407 --> 05:19.190
has been civilian militia

05:19.275 --> 05:21.275
capturing a lot of the
members of Boko Haram

05:21.411 --> 05:23.444
and turning them over
to the military.

05:23.579 --> 05:25.362
You know him?

05:25.448 --> 05:26.697
How?

05:32.038 --> 05:33.359
Man: Many Boko Haram
they caught--

05:33.456 --> 05:35.122
they will mention
this particular person.

05:35.208 --> 05:37.124
Man #2: He's a bad
type, notorious.

05:37.260 --> 05:38.342
He's notorious?

05:38.461 --> 05:40.294
Man #3: Very dangerous,
very dangerous.

05:40.430 --> 05:43.214
Larsen: What has this guy
done that makes him so bad?

05:47.804 --> 05:50.471
He is their gang leader.

05:50.556 --> 05:52.973
He's killed people--
this guy?

05:55.144 --> 05:57.228
Yes, he is killing people.

06:01.701 --> 06:03.734
Larsen: <i>As government
forces detain more and more</i>

06:03.820 --> 06:05.619
<i>alleged Boko Haram members,</i>

06:05.705 --> 06:09.240
<i>innocent civilians are getting
caught in the middle.</i>

06:09.325 --> 06:11.826
<i>Auto mechanic Saleh Isa Babawo</i>

06:11.961 --> 06:13.828
<i>was arrested last year and taken</i>

06:13.913 --> 06:16.130
<i>to Giwa Barracks--</i>
<i>the local jail.</i>

06:22.505 --> 06:24.255
This is a burn?
Yeah.

06:26.425 --> 06:27.391
Fuck.

06:27.510 --> 06:29.593
What is this?
What happened here?

06:30.480 --> 06:32.012
Oh, from being tied up?

06:32.098 --> 06:34.482
It just ripped away your flesh?

06:34.567 --> 06:36.684
Do you think the conditions
in Giwa Barracks--

06:36.819 --> 06:39.770
the way they treat you
and other innocent people--

06:39.856 --> 06:44.074
has created a backlash
against the security forces?

06:50.783 --> 06:53.501
<i>Stories like this are just
the tip of the iceberg.</i>

06:53.586 --> 06:56.537
<i>Lucy Freeman, an investigator
for Amnesty International,</i>

06:56.672 --> 06:59.039
<i>says that in the hunt</i>
<i>for Boko Haram,</i>

06:59.125 --> 07:01.008
<i>the military has been committing</i>

07:01.093 --> 07:03.344
<i>mass atrocities of its own.</i>

07:03.429 --> 07:07.047
We recently released
a report documenting

07:07.183 --> 07:09.550
very serious human rights
violations by the military.

07:09.685 --> 07:11.886
We found that they had
committed war crimes.

07:11.971 --> 07:13.854
<i>One of the most horrific cases</i>

07:13.940 --> 07:15.856
<i>that we documented</i>
<i>in this report</i>

07:15.958 --> 07:18.058
<i>was on the 14th of March, 2014.</i>

07:18.160 --> 07:21.612
<i>There's a large military detention
center in Northeast Nigeria</i>

07:21.731 --> 07:23.397
<i>called Giwa Barracks.</i>

07:23.533 --> 07:25.199
<i>And on that day, Boko Haram came</i>

07:25.284 --> 07:26.817
<i>and attacked the barracks.</i>

07:26.903 --> 07:29.987
<i>They freed the prisoners
there, over a thousand people.</i>

07:30.072 --> 07:33.741
<i>A large number of people tried
to go home to their families.</i>

07:33.876 --> 07:36.877
<i>They were rounded up by the
military and the civilian JTF,</i>

07:36.963 --> 07:41.832
and we documented the execution
of at least 620 of them.

07:41.918 --> 07:44.885
<i>We received video footage</i>
<i>from that particular day,</i>

07:44.971 --> 07:48.639
<i>which showed these men lined
up next to a large pit.</i>

07:48.758 --> 07:51.508
<i>And a man dressed</i>
<i>in military uniform</i>

07:51.594 --> 07:53.811
<i>then cuts their throat.</i>

07:59.068 --> 08:01.852
None of those people have
been brought to justice.

08:01.938 --> 08:04.154
Larsen: <i>Abuses like
this only strengthen</i>

08:04.273 --> 08:05.689
<i>Boko Haram's resolve.</i>

08:05.775 --> 08:09.243
<i>In 2015, more than 10,000
people were killed,</i>

08:09.328 --> 08:11.829
<i>making it</i>
<i>the deadliest year yet.</i>

08:11.948 --> 08:14.615
<i>To get their point of view</i>
<i>on the Giwa Barracks raid,</i>

08:14.700 --> 08:16.500
<i>we gained unprecedented access</i>

08:16.619 --> 08:19.954
<i>to an active Boko Haram
commander and his deputy.</i>

08:20.039 --> 08:22.423
How many members do you have?

08:25.962 --> 08:28.045
What's wrong with your leg?

08:29.265 --> 08:32.216
You have a bullet?
How did that happen?

08:39.191 --> 08:41.775
Was this the attack
on Giwa Barracks?

09:02.131 --> 09:04.498
Larsen: <i>You're not afraid
to fight with soldiers?</i>

09:04.583 --> 09:06.750
You don't think
you'll be killed?

09:10.473 --> 09:12.389
Larsen: <i>We wanted to
know if the commander</i>

09:12.508 --> 09:15.843
<i>was involved in the group's
most infamous attack--</i>

09:15.928 --> 09:18.512
<i>the kidnapping</i>
<i>of nearly 300 girls</i>

09:18.648 --> 09:20.431
<i>from a school in Chibok,</i>

09:20.516 --> 09:22.733
<i>which sparked outrage</i>
<i>around the world.</i>

09:22.852 --> 09:26.437
Everybody is talking
about the Chibok girls.

09:28.607 --> 09:29.740
Where are they?

09:29.859 --> 09:31.525
(chuckles)

09:45.841 --> 09:48.676
So they're now
a bargaining chip?

09:57.186 --> 09:59.136
<i>While the Chibok girls</i>
<i>remain missing,</i>

09:59.221 --> 10:02.356
<i>this is far from</i>
<i>an isolated incident.</i>

10:02.441 --> 10:05.225
<i>In the town of Yola,</i>
<i>we met 16-year-old Zainab,</i>

10:05.361 --> 10:07.111
<i>who's one of thousands of women</i>

10:07.229 --> 10:09.396
<i>who have been abducted</i>
<i>by Boko Haram.</i>

10:36.592 --> 10:39.259
<i>But they don't just</i>
<i>marry these girls.</i>

10:39.395 --> 10:42.312
<i>They've begun using them</i>
<i>in their attacks.</i>

10:52.608 --> 10:55.359
(Zainab speaking)

11:00.783 --> 11:04.284
<i>Zainab escaped after five
months in captivity,</i>

11:04.336 --> 11:08.372
<i>but not before she was impregnated
by one of her captors.</i>

12:32.458 --> 12:34.875
Larsen: <i>As the cycle of
violence continues to build,</i>

12:35.010 --> 12:37.628
<i>it's now spilled outside</i>
<i>of Nigeria's borders.</i>

12:37.713 --> 12:40.714
Is Boko Haram spreading
to the region?

12:57.566 --> 13:00.450
<i>To see how far</i>
<i>the fight had spread,</i>

13:00.569 --> 13:02.236
<i>I traveled to N'Djamena, Chad,</i>

13:02.371 --> 13:05.956
<i>where the conflict shows</i>
<i>no signs of slowing down.</i>

13:06.075 --> 13:08.075
Behind me is a compound

13:08.210 --> 13:10.077
which two days ago was the site

13:10.162 --> 13:13.830
of a bloody
Boko Haram suicide attack.

13:13.916 --> 13:16.049
(flies buzzing)

13:33.018 --> 13:36.436
Did you find any materials or
anything, any bomb-making materials?

13:42.161 --> 13:44.278
Larsen: <i>What they found
was a small arsenal</i>

13:44.363 --> 13:47.281
<i>intended to launch more of
these attacks around Chad.</i>

13:47.366 --> 13:49.917
This is an RPG round right here.

13:50.002 --> 13:54.121
This bag has, I'd estimate, like,
15 to 20 RPG rounds in it.

14:02.214 --> 14:05.132
<i>As the hunt for Boko
Haram escalates in Chad,</i>

14:05.217 --> 14:08.635
<i>these soldiers say that militants
from around the region</i>

14:08.771 --> 14:12.055
<i>are still joining up</i>
<i>to wage jihad.</i>

14:12.141 --> 14:13.941
(whistling)

14:16.228 --> 14:19.363
Most of the Boko Haram--
they're Kanuri, right?

14:19.481 --> 14:21.982
(speaking English)

14:22.117 --> 14:23.233
Now it's everybody?

14:23.319 --> 14:25.235
From Mali,

14:25.321 --> 14:27.821
Bamako, Timbuktu?

14:27.957 --> 14:29.957
That's bad.

14:31.577 --> 14:33.493
<i>It gets worse.</i>
<i>Boko Haram,</i>

14:33.629 --> 14:36.997
<i>which killed more people in
terror attacks than ISIS in 2014,</i>

14:37.132 --> 14:39.883
<i>has actually pledged</i>
<i>allegiance to them,</i>

14:40.002 --> 14:41.668
<i>even renaming themselves</i>

14:41.754 --> 14:44.588
<i>the Islamic State's</i>
<i>West Africa Province.</i>

14:44.673 --> 14:47.341
<i>This new alliance between
Boko Haram and ISIS</i>

14:47.476 --> 14:50.143
<i>does not bode well</i>
<i>for the region.</i>

15:18.173 --> 15:20.540
Shane Smith: Since the
beginning of life on Earth,

15:20.626 --> 15:23.543
evolution has been steered
by the demands of survival

15:23.629 --> 15:25.512
in the natural world.

15:25.597 --> 15:27.464
However, today, new technology

15:27.549 --> 15:29.383
is completely upending
that process,

15:29.468 --> 15:32.969
allowing us to alter different
species as we go forward,

15:33.055 --> 15:35.555
including our own.

15:47.036 --> 15:49.317
So how is it that the mosquitoes
are genetically modified?

15:49.321 --> 15:51.988
What's different about these
guys than any other mosquitoes?

15:52.074 --> 15:54.791
(speaking English)

16:03.469 --> 16:05.869
Isobel Yeung: <i>These mosquitoes
have been genetically modified</i>

16:05.921 --> 16:08.472
<i>to breed with, and
eliminate, their own species</i>

16:08.590 --> 16:11.892
<i>in an urgent attempt to wipe
out carriers of dengue fever.</i>

16:11.977 --> 16:15.345
<i>Every week, 800,000</i>
<i>of these mosquitoes</i>

16:15.431 --> 16:17.731
<i>are being released</i>
<i>into the wild.</i>

16:17.816 --> 16:19.399
It's crazy to think

16:19.485 --> 16:21.902
that you're trying to solve
the dengue fever problem

16:21.987 --> 16:25.572
by releasing so many
mosquitoes into the wild.

16:29.078 --> 16:30.994
Yeung: <i>Neighborhoods
targeted by the program</i>

16:31.113 --> 16:33.029
<i>are seeing a more than</i>
<i>90% reduction</i>

16:33.115 --> 16:34.998
<i>in dengue-carrying</i>
<i>mosquitoes.</i>

16:35.117 --> 16:37.667
<i>These doctored mosquitoes are
part of a larger movement</i>

16:37.786 --> 16:40.420
<i>to produce animals that fight
the diseases they spread.</i>

16:40.506 --> 16:42.789
<i>In Scotland,</i>
<i>in the same facility</i>

16:42.925 --> 16:44.458
<i>that produced Dolly the sheep,</i>

16:44.593 --> 16:46.293
<i>the first-ever</i>
<i>cloned animal,</i>

16:46.378 --> 16:48.678
<i>Dr. Bruce Whitelaw</i>
<i>is trying to create pigs</i>

16:48.797 --> 16:50.931
<i>that are resistant</i>
<i>to African swine fever.</i>

16:51.016 --> 16:53.884
<i>He's an expert in a field</i>
<i>called transgenics.</i>

16:53.969 --> 16:56.470
So what "transgenic" means

16:56.555 --> 16:59.973
is that you've taken a gene which you
have constructed in the laboratory,

17:00.109 --> 17:03.226
and you've introduced it into
the genome of the animal.

17:03.312 --> 17:05.395
When you look
at this snout here,

17:05.481 --> 17:07.897
you'll see it's got
a yellow tinge to it.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.566
Yeung:
Hey, piggy, piggy.

17:09.651 --> 17:11.284
So what they've done is,

17:11.369 --> 17:13.537
they've taken
the fluorescent gene,

17:13.655 --> 17:15.906
which is naturally present
in jellyfish,

17:15.991 --> 17:19.159
and they've put it inside these
pigs as a little marker,

17:19.243 --> 17:21.211
so they know which ones
are transgenic or not.

17:21.329 --> 17:24.498
Yeung: <i>In the past, genetic
engineering technologies</i>

17:24.583 --> 17:26.500
<i>often used</i>
<i>visual markers like this</i>

17:26.585 --> 17:28.385
<i>to prove that they even worked.</i>

17:28.503 --> 17:31.972
<i>But the science has recently
taken a huge step forward.</i>

17:33.342 --> 17:35.425
<i>The breakthrough is</i>
<i>a molecular technology</i>

17:35.511 --> 17:37.344
<i>called CRISPR CAS-9.</i>

17:37.429 --> 17:39.563
<i>It's a protein</i>
<i>that uses molecular blades</i>

17:39.681 --> 17:41.431
<i>to make cuts in host DNA,</i>

17:41.517 --> 17:44.518
<i>replacing genes you don't
want with genes you do.</i>

17:44.653 --> 17:46.520
<i>It has the power to transform</i>

17:46.605 --> 17:48.438
<i>every form of life</i>
<i>as we know it.</i>

17:48.524 --> 17:52.192
It's all about a way of editing
genes, known as CRISPR.

17:52.327 --> 17:55.695
Female reporter: <i>CRISPR is being
described as a game changer.</i>

17:55.831 --> 17:57.697
Breakthrough Prize is awarded to

17:57.783 --> 18:00.834
Emmanuelle Charpentier
and Jennifer Doudna.

18:00.919 --> 18:03.670
<i>Jennifer Doudna, a leading
professor of chemistry and biology</i>

18:03.755 --> 18:06.373
<i>at UC Berkeley,</i>
<i>codiscovered CRISPR.</i>

18:06.508 --> 18:09.125
Really, what we're doing with
the CRISPR technology is,

18:09.211 --> 18:11.461
we're using it as a scalpel,

18:11.547 --> 18:13.547
a very precise cleaver,

18:13.682 --> 18:15.632
that makes breaks in the DNA

18:15.717 --> 18:19.386
where we as scientists
want to introduce changes.

18:20.772 --> 18:25.392
<i>DNA is the computer program</i>
<i>that runs the cell.</i>

18:25.527 --> 18:28.061
What if there's a mistake
somewhere in that code?

18:28.146 --> 18:32.616
<i>CRISPR technology</i>
<i>allows us to find the place</i>

18:32.734 --> 18:35.235
<i>where this mistake</i>
<i>has occurred in the DNA</i>

18:35.320 --> 18:38.455
<i>and allow the cell</i>
<i>to correct that mistake.</i>

18:38.574 --> 18:40.490
<i>And within just a few months</i>

18:40.576 --> 18:42.576
<i>of our publication</i>
<i>of our initial work,</i>

18:42.661 --> 18:46.079
<i>many scientists were testing
it in plants, animals,</i>

18:46.215 --> 18:49.666
and in all cases it was
working extremely well.

18:49.751 --> 18:52.419
We really have to actually
for the first time

18:52.554 --> 18:54.588
confront this possibility

18:54.723 --> 18:58.842
of being able to alter
human beings in the future

18:58.927 --> 19:01.761
and the wisdom of doing that.

19:01.897 --> 19:03.897
Yeung: <i>One reason
for that caution</i>

19:03.982 --> 19:06.766
<i>is that CRISPR edits are so easy
to apply across all species.</i>

19:06.852 --> 19:10.020
<i>At New York University,</i>
<i>researcher Michael Perry</i>

19:10.105 --> 19:12.689
<i>is looking at the genes that
affect butterflies' vision.</i>

19:12.774 --> 19:15.525
In this case, we're gonna
try to edit a gene

19:15.611 --> 19:18.695
that we think might be involved
in making the butterfly eye

19:18.780 --> 19:22.332
able to see more colors than
other types of insects.

19:22.451 --> 19:25.752
Okay, so now the needle
is in the egg.

19:25.837 --> 19:28.121
So now you can see some
yolk being displaced.

19:28.257 --> 19:29.923
Yeung: Yeah.
Okay, and that's it.

19:30.008 --> 19:31.675
It's as simple as that?
It's as simple as that.

19:31.793 --> 19:33.293
That's one edited gene?

19:33.378 --> 19:35.462
That is one edited genome.

19:35.597 --> 19:37.714
So how different
would this process look

19:37.799 --> 19:39.799
if you were injecting
human embryos?

19:39.935 --> 19:42.269
(chuckles)
Not my specialty.

19:42.354 --> 19:45.021
Yeung: <i>In theory,
applying CRISPR to humans</i>

19:45.140 --> 19:48.141
<i>could eliminate diseases</i>
<i>and steer our evolution.</i>

19:48.277 --> 19:50.527
<i>The problem is that so far,</i>

19:50.646 --> 19:52.812
<i>we can't always predict</i>
<i>what will happen.</i>

19:52.948 --> 19:55.031
The antennae is drooping.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.617
Its legs haven't
formulated properly.

19:57.703 --> 19:59.953
And the color is gone
on the wings.

20:00.038 --> 20:01.204
Michael Perry:
Right.

20:01.323 --> 20:03.490
We knew from research
in fruit flies

20:03.575 --> 20:06.576
that this gene played a role
in developing antennae

20:06.662 --> 20:08.828
and in producing
bristles on the legs,

20:08.914 --> 20:10.997
but we didn't expect
a role in wing pattern.

20:11.083 --> 20:13.403
And so, even in this gene that
was reasonably well studied,

20:13.418 --> 20:15.635
we could predict what some
of the effects would be.

20:15.721 --> 20:18.004
We did not expect
a role in color pattern.

20:18.090 --> 20:20.006
Do you think that
this kind of technology

20:20.142 --> 20:23.510
will fundamentally
impact our future?

20:23.645 --> 20:25.178
Everyone is excited
about CRISPR.

20:25.314 --> 20:27.897
I think it really is gonna
change biology in general.

20:28.016 --> 20:30.066
Yeung: <i>While CRISPR is
not yet considered safe</i>

20:30.185 --> 20:31.935
<i>to use on human embryos,</i>

20:32.020 --> 20:35.155
<i>genetic selection is already
happening in the US.</i>

20:35.240 --> 20:39.159
<i>Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg is
using a process known as PGD</i>

20:39.244 --> 20:41.111
<i>to genetically analyze embryos</i>

20:41.196 --> 20:43.196
<i>and allow parents</i>
<i>to screen for diseases</i>

20:43.281 --> 20:46.082
<i>and even choose favorable
traits in their children.</i>

20:46.201 --> 20:48.084
PGD starts for
Pre-implantation--

20:48.203 --> 20:51.087
before it goes back to Mom--
Genetic Diagnosis.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.373
And that way we're able
to make these decisions

20:53.508 --> 20:56.042
that the parents want to make
before they get the embryo.

20:56.128 --> 20:58.428
Mm-hmm, and so the purpose
of that is to identify

20:58.547 --> 21:00.847
certain diseases that might
exist in certain embryos...

21:00.932 --> 21:02.799
Exactly.
...and also the sex.

21:02.884 --> 21:04.434
Right, we can identify gender

21:04.553 --> 21:06.603
with almost 100% certainty.

21:06.722 --> 21:09.139
So what are we looking at here?
This is a PGD report.

21:09.224 --> 21:10.974
So this is a PGD report
from the laboratory.

21:11.059 --> 21:13.026
So these embryos were
biopsied yesterday.

21:13.111 --> 21:15.311
So here we have
an embryo--

21:15.397 --> 21:17.280
46 chromosomes, which is normal.

21:17.399 --> 21:18.948
XX means girl.

21:19.067 --> 21:21.901
The next one--
46 chromosomes, also normal.

21:22.037 --> 21:24.070
But it's XY instead of XX.

21:24.206 --> 21:26.539
So this is a normal male.

21:26.625 --> 21:28.491
The couple wants a baby
with blue eyes.

21:28.577 --> 21:30.910
They've got three girls. They
said, "Can we get a boy,

21:31.046 --> 21:32.545
and can the boy have
blue eyes?"

21:32.631 --> 21:34.497
And what we got back
was a report showing

21:34.583 --> 21:37.133
that embryo number five
and embryo number seven

21:37.252 --> 21:39.052
carry the genes for blue eyes.

21:39.137 --> 21:41.337
It's just a case of selecting which
ones you want to put in there.

21:41.423 --> 21:43.390
Exactly. Exactly.
So we asked Mom and Dad,

21:43.475 --> 21:46.593
"Here's what we've got.
What do you want?"

21:46.678 --> 21:49.262
Yeung: <i>We met with
Deborah and Jonathan,</i>

21:49.347 --> 21:51.731
<i>one of thousands of couples</i>
<i>across the country</i>

21:51.817 --> 21:55.235
<i>who have chosen to use PGD.</i>

21:55.320 --> 21:57.270
It sounds like
a no-brainer, you know,

21:57.406 --> 21:59.656
if you want to be able
to test for more diseases

21:59.775 --> 22:02.525
and have the healthiest
child that you can.

22:02.611 --> 22:05.195
And you also chose to have
sex selection, right?

22:05.280 --> 22:06.696
Yep, right.

22:06.782 --> 22:08.448
Yeah, we're picking a girl.

22:08.583 --> 22:10.333
We both want to have
a baby girl.

22:10.452 --> 22:13.169
Were there any other traits
that you were selecting for

22:13.288 --> 22:14.889
or that you had the option
to select for?

22:14.956 --> 22:17.457
I think we'll be
offered eye color.

22:17.592 --> 22:19.459
Well, when we met with
Dr. Steinberg, they're--

22:19.544 --> 22:21.544
the advances they're making
are pretty incredible.

22:21.630 --> 22:23.596
We had no idea about eye color,

22:23.682 --> 22:26.633
but that is something that he offers.
We're not doing eye color.

22:26.768 --> 22:30.854
You're going in for your actual retrieval
process tomorrow, is that right?

22:30.972 --> 22:34.190
How are you feeling?
Very nervous.

22:34.309 --> 22:36.276
So here we go, a little pinch.

22:36.361 --> 22:38.144
Just hold real still.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.063
Yeung:
<i>In Dr. Steinberg's clinic,</i>

22:40.148 --> 22:42.148
<i>Deborah's eggs were
removed to be fertilized</i>

22:42.284 --> 22:43.900
<i>and then genetically analyzed.</i>

22:43.985 --> 22:46.653
Steinberg: So we finished the first two.
We're gonna pass that off.

22:46.738 --> 22:48.204
So they've got the fluid now.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.406
They're gonna be taking a
look under the microscope

22:50.492 --> 22:52.659
and we'll find
that first egg for you.

22:55.797 --> 22:58.548
And here you can see what
these technicians are doing.

22:58.667 --> 23:00.667
This is an egg?

23:00.802 --> 23:02.135
Two eggs?

23:02.220 --> 23:04.471
A little pinch again.

23:04.556 --> 23:07.090
Yeung:
Here comes another one.

23:10.228 --> 23:12.345
Yeung:
Just egg-hunting.

23:12.430 --> 23:14.514
16 eggs.

23:14.649 --> 23:16.349
You did great.

23:16.485 --> 23:19.102
We're taking one sperm,
and we're injecting it

23:19.187 --> 23:21.688
into the yolk of the human egg.

23:21.823 --> 23:23.907
There's the needle.
You can see one little sperm

23:24.025 --> 23:25.859
swimming up
inside of the needle.

23:25.994 --> 23:28.695
And now he's very gently going
to push the tip of the needle

23:28.780 --> 23:33.032
into the yolk of the egg.

23:33.168 --> 23:35.034
Yeung:
So that's it?

23:35.120 --> 23:37.036
It's fertilized.
It's a fertilized egg.

23:37.122 --> 23:38.872
Wow.

23:38.957 --> 23:41.925
So where's this PGD technology heading?
What's next, after eye color?

23:42.043 --> 23:43.793
The next place that it's headed

23:43.879 --> 23:46.596
is towards being able to
diagnose more and more diseases.

23:46.715 --> 23:48.548
And the final place
that it's headed

23:48.683 --> 23:51.134
is into allowing us
to select more and more

23:51.219 --> 23:53.520
elective traits,
characteristics.

23:53.605 --> 23:54.687
Such as?

23:54.773 --> 23:56.856
Height, weight.

23:56.942 --> 23:58.808
How soon before we can
select for height?

23:58.894 --> 24:01.728
I mean, I can give you
a five-year estimate.

24:01.813 --> 24:03.733
Five years before we can select for height?
Yeah.

24:03.865 --> 24:06.950
Yeung: <i>The global push to
develop these technologies</i>

24:07.068 --> 24:08.952
<i>is only intensifying.</i>

24:09.070 --> 24:10.954
<i>So we spoke to Jamie Metzl,</i>

24:11.072 --> 24:13.456
<i>an expert in both genomics
and foreign policy.</i>

24:14.576 --> 24:16.910
Ultimately, humans are
a data set.

24:17.045 --> 24:19.128
And as our
computing power increases,

24:19.247 --> 24:22.665
we're able to look at these
extremely complex genetics

24:22.751 --> 24:24.968
and then pull
all the pieces together

24:25.086 --> 24:26.970
and do genome-wide
association studies

24:27.088 --> 24:29.556
to try to figure out
what genes do what.

24:29.641 --> 24:31.474
So does that mean
that the countries

24:31.593 --> 24:34.177
or the societies with the
most data on genetics

24:34.262 --> 24:37.263
are leading the way in terms
of national competitiveness?

24:37.349 --> 24:40.433
We are at the very early
stage of this revolution.

24:40.569 --> 24:42.569
And, like in any revolution

24:42.654 --> 24:45.104
and any transformation,
first movers

24:45.190 --> 24:47.857
always have
a strategic advantage.

24:47.943 --> 24:51.527
China has identified
biotechnology

24:51.613 --> 24:53.446
as a strategic pillar

24:53.582 --> 24:55.448
in their most recent
five-year plan.

24:55.584 --> 24:57.700
Yeung:
<i>That 2011 plan devoted</i>

24:57.786 --> 25:01.120
<i>more than $308 billion</i>
<i>to biotechnology.</i>

25:01.256 --> 25:03.172
<i>It's paving the way</i>
<i>for a large-scale,</i>

25:03.291 --> 25:05.592
<i>assembly-line approach</i>
<i>to decoding</i>

25:05.677 --> 25:07.961
<i>the specific functions of genes.</i>

25:08.096 --> 25:10.930
<i>In Nanjing, CRISPR
technology is now being used</i>

25:11.016 --> 25:14.801
<i>to edit the genes of mice, in an
effort to isolate desired traits.</i>

25:14.886 --> 25:17.687
We're at the National Resource
Center for Mutant Mice.

25:17.806 --> 25:20.023
This is where they edit
hundreds of thousands

25:20.141 --> 25:22.058
of different types of mice.

25:22.143 --> 25:24.560
What we're looking at
down these microscopes

25:24.646 --> 25:26.729
are tiny, tiny
little mouse embryos.

25:26.815 --> 25:28.948
And what they're doing is,
they're injecting them.

25:29.034 --> 25:31.401
So they're editing the
mouse embryos right here.

25:31.486 --> 25:33.820
(man speaking Chinese)

25:38.660 --> 25:40.960
Wow, that's a lot of embryos.

25:41.046 --> 25:43.713
(Cunxiang Ju speaking)

25:50.889 --> 25:51.888
Wow.

25:52.007 --> 25:54.057
What are they doing here?

25:54.175 --> 25:56.559
(man speaking Chinese)

26:08.239 --> 26:10.356
These guys here
are being edited,

26:10.442 --> 26:12.358
so the result is that
they're completely bald.

26:12.494 --> 26:14.694
These ones here--
they're missing

26:14.779 --> 26:16.529
the metabolism gene,

26:16.614 --> 26:18.531
which means that
they're very, very fat.

26:18.616 --> 26:20.667
In this room,
they could hold the key

26:20.752 --> 26:22.535
to curing aging,

26:22.620 --> 26:24.620
to curing diabetes,
to curing cancer.

26:24.706 --> 26:26.706
There's just so much possibility

26:26.791 --> 26:28.875
held in this room of rodents.

26:29.010 --> 26:32.428
<i>The mouse genome is 85%
similar to the human genome,</i>

26:32.547 --> 26:34.347
<i>so unlocking</i>
<i>their gene functions</i>

26:34.432 --> 26:37.383
<i>could be critical to
understanding our own traits.</i>

26:37.519 --> 26:39.268
<i>And that could be huge here,</i>

26:39.387 --> 26:43.389
<i>where pre-birth services are
already in massive demand.</i>

26:43.525 --> 26:45.391
<i>We watched as couples</i>
<i>lined up down the block</i>

26:45.477 --> 26:48.695
<i>for different types</i>
<i>of fertility procedures.</i>

26:48.780 --> 26:50.613
Some of these people
have been queuing

26:50.732 --> 26:53.149
outside this Beijing public
hospital since 2:00 a.m.

26:56.071 --> 26:57.954
It's like a stampede in here.

26:58.073 --> 27:00.373
Everyone's just racing
to get an appointment

27:00.458 --> 27:02.241
so they can hopefully see
an IVF doctor.

27:02.377 --> 27:04.243
<i>And as thousands and</i>
<i>thousands of couples</i>

27:04.379 --> 27:06.295
<i>choose the latest</i>
<i>available treatments,</i>

27:06.414 --> 27:09.132
<i>the future is</i>
<i>quickly approaching.</i>

27:09.250 --> 27:11.551
<i>Companies are now</i>
<i>developing sequences</i>

27:11.636 --> 27:14.170
<i>that decode genes</i>
<i>at record speeds.</i>

27:14.255 --> 27:16.923
<i>And all that data will
eventually be funneled here,</i>

27:17.058 --> 27:20.059
<i>into one of the largest</i>
<i>gene banks in the world.</i>

27:20.145 --> 27:22.011
In here, they're gonna be
storing

27:22.097 --> 27:24.063
1.15 million people's
human genomes.

27:24.149 --> 27:25.932
This is pretty representative

27:26.067 --> 27:28.601
of China's massive
commitment and big, big push

27:28.737 --> 27:30.937
for the genetics industry.

27:31.072 --> 27:32.855
<i>But as the industry grows,</i>

27:32.941 --> 27:35.575
<i>so does our concern</i>
<i>about where it's headed.</i>

27:35.660 --> 27:38.077
Outrage over the latest move
toward designer babies.

27:38.163 --> 27:39.996
For the first time,
Chinese scientists

27:40.115 --> 27:43.833
use new technology to alter
DNA in human embryos.

27:43.952 --> 27:47.003
Serious implications
of designer babies.

27:47.122 --> 27:49.872
It will take us
down a slippery slope.

27:51.376 --> 27:53.793
Yeung: <i>This technology
continues to advance.</i>

27:53.878 --> 27:56.045
<i>And with parents</i>
<i>potentially being offered</i>

27:56.131 --> 27:58.264
<i>more and more traits</i>
<i>for purchase,</i>

27:58.349 --> 28:00.266
<i>we may be altering the future</i>

28:00.351 --> 28:02.351
<i>of the human race itself.</i>

28:02.470 --> 28:03.936
So how much are we moving

28:04.022 --> 28:06.472
towards a future of genetic
haves and have-nots?

28:06.558 --> 28:09.358
Certainly, there is the danger

28:09.477 --> 28:13.312
of the more advantaged
people in society today

28:13.448 --> 28:15.865
becoming even more advantaged.

28:15.984 --> 28:17.867
And that's very dangerous.

28:17.986 --> 28:19.986
<i>The worst-case</i>
<i>scenario is</i>

28:20.071 --> 28:22.405
<i>that we get into some type
of genetic arms race,</i>

28:22.490 --> 28:26.125
where people are manufacturing
their-- their children.

28:26.211 --> 28:29.495
<i>After four billion years</i>
<i>of evolution,</i>

28:29.631 --> 28:31.330
<i>we are now beginning a process</i>

28:31.416 --> 28:34.884
<i>where we will take active
control of our evolution.</i>

28:35.003 --> 28:37.837
And the consequences
of that are incredible.

28:37.922 --> 28:39.722
If you had a time machine,

28:39.841 --> 28:42.008
and you traveled a thousand
years into the future

28:42.143 --> 28:43.882
and brought a child back
to today,

28:44.002 --> 28:45.881
that kid would be Superman.
