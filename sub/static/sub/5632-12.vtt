WEBVTT

00:00.922 --> 00:03.419
BOOTH: Yeah, there's another one.
This is worse than I thought.

00:03.420 --> 00:04.586
Thank you.
What are you looking at?

00:04.621 --> 00:06.419
What case?
Perhaps I can help.

00:06.420 --> 00:07.919
Yeah, I-I guess,
but you know what,

00:07.954 --> 00:09.219
I don't think
you're gonna like this.

00:09.255 --> 00:10.521
You know how
you've been watching

00:10.556 --> 00:12.056
the Flyer games with me lately?
Yes.

00:12.091 --> 00:13.457
Six out of the
last 12 games.

00:13.492 --> 00:16.093
If each viewing
were a goal,

00:16.128 --> 00:18.262
that would be
two hat-stands.

00:18.297 --> 00:20.064
It's a hat-trick.
Hat-trick.

00:20.099 --> 00:22.600
Anyways, this is not good.
You're bad luck.

00:23.609 --> 00:25.776
Impossible, there's no such
thing as luck, Booth.

00:25.811 --> 00:26.747
Numbers don't lie.

00:26.748 --> 00:28.389
Look at that, you're like
the curse of the Bones-bino.

00:28.390 --> 00:29.564
Well, I don't know
what that means.

00:29.588 --> 00:30.588
Hey.

00:30.904 --> 00:32.337
MONTENEGRO: Hey, guys,
sorry we're late.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.405
Well, let me help.

00:33.406 --> 00:35.273
No, no, no, Booth, sit, sit.
It's fine.

00:35.308 --> 00:37.442
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
My arms work fine.

00:37.477 --> 00:39.811
It's the rest of me
that's the problem.

00:39.846 --> 00:41.312
So, how was

00:41.348 --> 00:42.780
physical therapy progressing?

00:42.816 --> 00:43.748
Oh, uh...

00:43.783 --> 00:45.383
it's not.

00:45.418 --> 00:47.518
Hodgins hasn't done
any PT in over a week.

00:47.554 --> 00:48.920
BOOTH: Why?

00:48.955 --> 00:50.288
I thought you said
everything was going good.

00:50.323 --> 00:51.255
Oh, yeah, no.

00:51.291 --> 00:52.957
I did say that, but, uh,

00:52.993 --> 00:54.626
Hodgins hid the truth from me.

00:54.661 --> 00:56.628
His doctor told me

00:56.663 --> 00:59.097
that he has
no neural connectivity.

00:59.132 --> 01:01.466
So, you-you don't
feel anything?

01:01.501 --> 01:02.967
No, I have plenty
of feeling.

01:03.003 --> 01:05.937
Anger, rage, uh, biting sarcasm.

01:05.972 --> 01:07.271
Though I'm not sure
if that last one

01:07.307 --> 01:09.173
is a feeling or just
a really pissy attitude.

01:09.209 --> 01:10.942
It's an attitude.
Thank you.

01:10.977 --> 01:12.377
Yeah, thanks for
the clarification.

01:12.412 --> 01:14.545
Oh.
MAN: Oh, I'm sorry.

01:14.581 --> 01:15.719
BOOTH: Oh, that's...
Look, don't worry about it.

01:15.743 --> 01:16.982
Damn it.

01:16.983 --> 01:18.383
Hey, you know what,
I-I've had too much

01:18.418 --> 01:19.784
caffeine today, anyways.

01:19.819 --> 01:21.919
Let me just move you back
a little bit here...

01:21.955 --> 01:23.287
No, enough, Angela, it's fine.

01:23.323 --> 01:24.956
It's fine, please.

01:24.991 --> 01:26.524
You know what,
this is probably not

01:26.559 --> 01:28.192
the most
wheelchair-friendly environment.

01:28.228 --> 01:29.861
(phone rings) Let's just go
somewhere else.

01:29.896 --> 01:30.895
No, the Royal Diner's our spot.

01:30.930 --> 01:32.196
Don't change that

01:32.232 --> 01:33.798
because of me, I...

01:35.035 --> 01:36.968
Well, unfortunately,

01:37.003 --> 01:38.970
it looks like we're all
gonna have to get going.

01:39.005 --> 01:41.639
A body was found
inside a burned-out car.

01:41.675 --> 01:43.875
Okay, we'll just do
a rain check then.

01:43.910 --> 01:45.209
BOOTH: Look, hey,

01:45.245 --> 01:46.310
I tell you what,
why don't you come over

01:46.346 --> 01:47.612
later tonight
and we can watch

01:47.647 --> 01:49.313
the game together,
just the guys?

01:49.349 --> 01:51.616
Thank you for that,
but I think you've all done

01:51.651 --> 01:53.084
enough charity
work for one day.

01:59.492 --> 02:00.692
SAROYAN:
According to the police,

02:00.727 --> 02:02.950
the deceased was driving
on a remote road

02:02.974 --> 02:05.399
when his car went through
a guard rail and caught fire.

02:05.699 --> 02:07.398
Considering how
charred the skull is,

02:07.434 --> 02:10.300
facial reconstruction
won't be easy.

02:10.336 --> 02:12.270
These days, not much is.

02:14.140 --> 02:16.870
Though, we have solved
murders with less.

02:16.871 --> 02:18.744
True, but this is not
a murder investigation.

02:18.778 --> 02:20.111
No, it's just
your run-of-the-mill

02:20.146 --> 02:22.647
car crash where we need
to find an ID.

02:22.682 --> 02:24.782
FUENTES:
The rounded supraorbital margins

02:24.818 --> 02:26.184
suggest the victim was male.

02:26.219 --> 02:27.819
Yeah, well,
whoever he was...

02:27.854 --> 02:29.420
he was obviously poor.

02:29.456 --> 02:31.489
I mean,
look at this old clunker.

02:31.524 --> 02:34.525
This car was a piece of crap
even before the accident.

02:34.561 --> 02:35.526
BRENNAN:
Any chance

02:35.562 --> 02:37.195
the car can give us an ID?

02:37.230 --> 02:38.830
It could, if the VIN weren't

02:38.865 --> 02:40.264
burned beyond all recognition.

02:40.300 --> 02:41.933
FUENTES:
Judging by the wear

02:41.968 --> 02:44.869
on the mandibular teeth,
I'd place the victim's age

02:44.904 --> 02:45.837
at early 40s.

02:45.872 --> 02:46.971
SAROYAN:
Looks like the fire

02:47.006 --> 02:48.873
burned away most of the blood,

02:48.908 --> 02:50.675
but there should be
enough liver left

02:50.710 --> 02:52.643
to run a tox screen.
Oh, you're thinking

02:52.679 --> 02:54.278
he could have been
drinking at time of death?

02:54.314 --> 02:55.446
Hey, hold on a second.

02:55.482 --> 02:58.216
Looks like a new carburetor
was put in recently.

02:58.251 --> 02:59.617
Oh, if you can get
the serial numbers,

02:59.652 --> 03:00.685
then Booth should be able

03:00.720 --> 03:02.186
to track down
where it was sold.

03:02.222 --> 03:03.921
Yeah, great idea there, Angela.

03:03.957 --> 03:05.917
No way I would have thought
of that one on my own.

03:11.231 --> 03:13.798
(grunting)

03:17.170 --> 03:20.404
SAROYAN: Uh, Dr. Hodgins,
would you like a hand?

03:20.440 --> 03:22.373
No, but I could use
a new pair of legs.

03:24.677 --> 03:26.911
No fans of paraplegic humor?

03:26.946 --> 03:28.479
Tough crowd.

03:29.916 --> 03:32.250
Yeah, yeah, I remember
the guy who bought this.

03:32.285 --> 03:34.952
He was a tall dude,
light brown hair--

03:34.988 --> 03:36.120
Oh, my God.

03:36.156 --> 03:37.522
Wait, you are totally

03:37.557 --> 03:39.123
packing heat right now,
aren't you?

03:39.159 --> 03:41.392
Let's try to stay focused
on the case, okay, Allie?

03:41.427 --> 03:43.528
Am I, like, the star witness
or something?

03:43.563 --> 03:45.997
No, you're the person
who sold a carburetor

03:46.032 --> 03:47.365
to a man
who is now deceased.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.766
Yeah, but I'm still, like,

03:48.802 --> 03:50.768
instrumental to the case?

03:50.804 --> 03:52.270
Couldn't do it without you.

03:52.305 --> 03:53.571
(chuckles)

03:53.606 --> 03:55.940
Now, uh, do you remember
this guy's name?

03:55.975 --> 03:58.142
Beats me. I mean, dude
came into the store

03:58.178 --> 03:59.510
all the time for parts,
but he always paid cash.

03:59.546 --> 04:01.445
Okay, so he wasn't poor?

04:01.481 --> 04:02.446
Oh, hell no.

04:02.482 --> 04:03.815
I mean, at least he dressed

04:03.850 --> 04:05.049
and acted like a rich guy.

04:05.084 --> 04:06.884
You know, nice shirt,
fancy phone.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.452
Mm-hmm, anything else
you can tell me about him?

04:08.488 --> 04:09.453
Yeah.

04:09.489 --> 04:10.521
The guy was a major Wang.

04:10.557 --> 04:12.123
No, seriously, he was, like,

04:12.158 --> 04:13.591
our rudest customer ever.
He used to always

04:13.626 --> 04:14.992
talk down to me
'cause I'm a girl,

04:15.028 --> 04:16.761
like I couldn't
possibly know anything

04:16.796 --> 04:19.463
about multiport fuel injectors
just cause I have a hoo-ha.

04:19.499 --> 04:21.599
Okay, well,

04:21.634 --> 04:24.168
thank you, uh,
for your time, Allie.

04:24.204 --> 04:25.436
Wait, what, that's it?

04:25.471 --> 04:28.606
Well, unless you have
any more information.

04:28.641 --> 04:30.308
Well, no, i-i-it's just that--

04:30.343 --> 04:31.976
it is so sick being here,

04:32.011 --> 04:34.078
raked across the coals
by a real, live FBI agent.

04:34.113 --> 04:35.353
I-I-I didn't rake you across...

04:35.381 --> 04:37.281
Do you mind if I-I take
a selfie with you?

04:37.317 --> 04:38.683
It's just,
the guys at the store,

04:38.718 --> 04:39.851
they're never
gonna believe this.

04:39.886 --> 04:42.386

(chirping)

05:33.806 --> 05:36.307
(loud mechanical whirring)

05:38.011 --> 05:39.477
FUENTES: <i>Dr. Saroyan,</i>
<i>take a look at this.</i>

05:39.512 --> 05:42.113
I found
a circumferential fracture

05:42.148 --> 05:43.915
on the victim's
parietal bones.

05:43.950 --> 05:44.882
That's odd.

05:44.918 --> 05:46.217
Injuries to that area

05:46.252 --> 05:48.286
suggest the victim
hit the top of his head

05:48.321 --> 05:49.887
on the steering wheel.
Unless...

05:49.923 --> 05:51.355
the victim
wasn't conscious

05:51.391 --> 05:52.790
when the car went
through the guard rail.

05:52.825 --> 05:54.158
You are correct.

05:54.193 --> 05:55.660
The edges of the fractures

05:55.695 --> 05:57.828
on the victim's parietal
bone show no sign of

05:57.864 --> 05:59.730
hemorrhagic staining.
Suggesting they were made postmortem.

05:59.766 --> 06:01.565
This was no accident.

06:01.601 --> 06:03.801
Yeah, well,
that sounds good to me.

06:03.836 --> 06:06.103
Take a murdered, rich d-bag

06:06.139 --> 06:07.271
over a charity case
any day.

06:07.307 --> 06:09.774
Dr. Hodgins,
you used the lift.

06:09.809 --> 06:11.609
How was it?
It was exhilarating, Cam.

06:11.644 --> 06:13.010
If I'd known
I was getting one of those,

06:13.046 --> 06:14.312
I'd have crippled myself
months ago.

06:14.347 --> 06:16.647
I... get it.

06:16.683 --> 06:20.551
It's just nice to see you
back up here where you belong.

06:20.586 --> 06:23.054
Uh, you just said something
about the victim being rich.

06:23.089 --> 06:25.823
I'm worried that it is
too early to conclude this

06:25.858 --> 06:27.425
based solely on, uh, testimony

06:27.460 --> 06:29.327
of an auto parts clerk.
Really?

06:29.362 --> 06:30.461
What about this?

06:30.496 --> 06:31.829
I don't know too many paupers

06:31.864 --> 06:34.065
who have a key fob
for a brand-new Lexus.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.132
Why would someone

06:35.168 --> 06:36.500
who owns a luxury car

06:36.536 --> 06:37.935
drive a beat-up old junker?

06:37.971 --> 06:38.903
Who knows?

06:38.938 --> 06:39.870
The world is full

06:39.906 --> 06:41.238
of messed up people.

06:41.274 --> 06:42.673
I should know.

06:42.709 --> 06:44.976
I'm one of them.

07:20.216 --> 07:23.417
So, because of the fire damage,
I was only able to do

07:23.422 --> 07:26.610
a partial reconstruction,
but the good news is,

07:26.710 --> 07:30.779
I may have found
another way to get his ID.

07:30.814 --> 07:32.080
Is that the victim's
cell phone?

07:32.115 --> 07:34.317
Yeah, it's also
his wallet.

07:34.318 --> 07:35.784
It's one of those
two-in-one cases.

07:35.820 --> 07:38.687
Which means the
victim's driver's license

07:38.722 --> 07:40.589
may be somewhere inside.

07:40.624 --> 07:41.790
Yeah, that's why I borrowed
Hodgins' laser-cutter.

07:41.826 --> 07:44.660
It's sort of
old-school <i>Star</i> Wars,

07:44.695 --> 07:46.128
but it's the best way

07:46.163 --> 07:47.496

Well, then,
may the Force

07:49.767 --> 07:52.167
remain in your proximity.

07:52.203 --> 07:54.636
Yeah, sweetie,
something like that.

07:54.672 --> 07:57.272
I couldn't help
but notice Hodgins

07:57.308 --> 07:59.508
speaking to you
quite harshly today.

07:59.543 --> 08:02.911
Yeah, it's not great, but...

08:02.947 --> 08:04.246
I guess it's just, uh,

08:04.281 --> 08:06.815
one of the stages
of dealing with trauma.

08:06.851 --> 08:09.685
It seems unfair that you have
to endure such treatment.

08:09.720 --> 08:13.188
Well, we agreed to stand
by each other.

08:13.224 --> 08:15.557
For better or worse.

08:17.261 --> 08:18.827
Okay, blob,

08:18.863 --> 08:22.364
let's see what you've got.

08:28.105 --> 08:30.839
It appears the fire fused

08:30.875 --> 08:32.741
the victim's credit cards
into a giant amalgam.

08:32.775 --> 08:35.409
Yeah, you see that tiny piece
of metal in there?

08:36.514 --> 08:40.182
Let me just see
if I can extract it.

08:41.552 --> 08:43.184
Looks like a microchip.

08:43.220 --> 08:46.355
Yeah, many of the new credit
cards have them embedded now.

08:46.390 --> 08:49.224
I can just scan it.

08:56.033 --> 08:57.599
BRENNAN:
Emil Bradford.

08:57.635 --> 09:01.003
Looks like we found our guy.

09:03.374 --> 09:04.573
I hear you got an ID.

09:04.608 --> 09:07.476
Yeah, Emil Bradford,
43 years old.

09:07.511 --> 09:08.710
Divorced six years ago.

09:08.746 --> 09:10.045
No kids or family in the area.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.246
Angela said that

09:11.282 --> 09:12.981
the cell phone
was literal toast,

09:13.017 --> 09:14.716
so I figured I'd go ahead
and issue a warrant

09:14.752 --> 09:15.752
to get his phone records.

09:15.786 --> 09:17.719
Yeah, that's a good idea.

09:17.755 --> 09:19.595
At least then we can see
who he was talking to.

09:19.623 --> 09:21.523
Yeah. Oh!

09:21.559 --> 09:23.258
Almost forgot there.

09:23.294 --> 09:24.459
Got you a little something.

09:24.495 --> 09:26.495
Look at that. Donuts.

09:26.530 --> 09:28.664
There's over a dozen here.
What do you think I am, you?

09:28.699 --> 09:31.099
I figured some
emotional eating might help.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.368
It's been a rough couple weeks
for the Flyers.

09:33.404 --> 09:36.071
You know what, I'm pretty sure
Bones is causing it.

09:36.106 --> 09:37.172
You think Dr. Brennan is a jinx?

09:37.207 --> 09:38.941
I don't know,
you tell me, all right.

09:38.976 --> 09:41.410
The Flyers have
lost the last six

09:41.445 --> 09:42.444
when she's
watched with me.

09:42.479 --> 09:43.745
Oh, no, no, no, no,

09:43.781 --> 09:45.421
you need to nip this one
in the bud, okay?

09:45.449 --> 09:47.516
Trust me, as a lifelong
Cubs fan, jinxes are real.

09:47.551 --> 09:49.151
What am I supposed to do? Hmm?

09:49.186 --> 09:51.353
Tell her that she can't watch
the Flyer games with me?

09:51.388 --> 09:54.189
Well, uh, sounds
like a good start.

09:54.224 --> 09:56.858
Oh, wow, seriously.

09:56.894 --> 09:58.060
Bones is not gonna like
it if I put

09:58.095 --> 09:59.661
hockey before her.

09:59.697 --> 10:00.862
That's bad news.

10:00.898 --> 10:02.064
Well, let me remind you

10:02.099 --> 10:03.465
that my all-time
favorite baseball team

10:03.500 --> 10:05.601
hasn't made it to
a World Series since 1945.

10:05.636 --> 10:07.235
You want a postseason,

10:07.271 --> 10:08.604
you may not have a choice.

10:08.639 --> 10:10.505
These are good.
Right?

10:10.541 --> 10:12.941
FUENTES: There are remodeled
bilateral fractures

10:12.977 --> 10:14.576
on the nasal bones,

10:14.612 --> 10:18.080
zygomatics,
and around the orbital sockets,

10:18.115 --> 10:20.649
all appearing to
be five to ten years old.

10:20.684 --> 10:22.918
And the x-rays of the left

10:22.953 --> 10:24.653
radius and ulna
show evidence of remodeling

10:24.688 --> 10:26.688
from about
the same time period.

10:26.724 --> 10:29.658
That's in line with Bradford's
hospital records.

10:29.693 --> 10:32.060
It appears he had a series
of late-night ER visits

10:32.096 --> 10:33.462
just over
six and a half years ago.

10:33.497 --> 10:35.564
Well, must have been
a rough time in his life.

10:35.599 --> 10:36.599
It was.

10:36.634 --> 10:38.634
He was getting divorced.
Mm.

10:38.669 --> 10:41.670
Taken together, this
constellation of injuries

10:41.705 --> 10:44.272
is consistent
with domestic violence.

10:44.308 --> 10:45.874
But the victim...

10:45.909 --> 10:47.142
is a man.

10:47.177 --> 10:48.610
Yeah, surely, you know that men

10:48.646 --> 10:50.412
can also be the victims
of spousal abuse.

10:50.447 --> 10:52.648
Not real men.

10:53.584 --> 10:55.183
All I'm saying is the injuries

10:55.219 --> 10:56.551
could be from something else.

10:56.587 --> 10:58.787
Did the victim report being abused?
No,

10:58.822 --> 11:00.122
but that doesn't surprise me,

11:00.157 --> 11:02.157
given cultural biases,
like your own,

11:02.192 --> 11:04.292
men are often too ashamed
to admit it.

11:09.767 --> 11:12.734
Dr. Hodgins,
how is the car

11:12.770 --> 11:14.403
autopsy going?

11:14.438 --> 11:17.439
Or would it be an auto-topsy?

11:17.474 --> 11:19.307
I'd laugh, but the explosion
must have paralyzed

11:19.343 --> 11:21.643
my sense of humor
as well, but...

11:21.679 --> 11:23.211
at least I figured out
what started the fire.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.813
See that fuel line there?

11:24.848 --> 11:26.515
Yep.

11:26.550 --> 11:29.017
Well, it must have ruptured
when the car went off the road,

11:29.053 --> 11:30.986
basically turning
the inside of the vehicle

11:31.021 --> 11:33.555
into a convection oven,
and clearly

11:33.590 --> 11:36.692
fusing the trunk shut
in the process.

11:36.727 --> 11:39.428
This information will be
very useful for my project.

11:39.463 --> 11:40.862
Ah.

11:40.898 --> 11:43.265
You can leave those right there,
guys, thanks.

11:49.139 --> 11:50.972
What's with the animal parts?

11:51.008 --> 11:52.641
What, there's not enough blood
and guts here in the lab?

11:52.676 --> 11:54.176
You had to go out
and buy your own?

11:54.211 --> 11:56.945
Actually, I'm conducting
an experiment.

11:56.980 --> 11:57.946
Well, since when

11:57.981 --> 11:59.214
do you do experiments,

11:59.249 --> 12:00.348
especially ones that involve

12:00.384 --> 12:02.217
lamb shanks, a cow heart,

12:02.252 --> 12:04.519
and four bags of pig intestines?

12:04.555 --> 12:07.022
I'm trying to determine
when Emil Bradford's body

12:07.057 --> 12:08.857
was dumped.
By doing what?

12:08.892 --> 12:11.159
You gonna create a
pound-for-pound sausage replica

12:11.195 --> 12:12.961
of the victim, light it on fire,
and see how long it burns?

12:12.996 --> 12:15.897
That pretty much sums it up,

12:15.933 --> 12:18.500
but I could use your help
finding an enclosure

12:18.535 --> 12:20.368
to simulate the inside of a car.

12:20.404 --> 12:23.939
(groaning): Okay, nice try,
but I know what you're doing.

12:23.974 --> 12:25.674
Trying to solve a murder.

12:25.709 --> 12:27.776
Yeah, sure you are.
But you know what?

12:27.811 --> 12:30.078
You can just throw
your little pig man barbecue

12:30.114 --> 12:31.847
over there without my help
because I'm busy.

12:31.882 --> 12:34.983
Well, fine,
I didn't need you anyway.

12:35.018 --> 12:36.551
(groaning)

12:36.587 --> 12:38.520
(hammering)
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

12:38.555 --> 12:40.055
I'm having
the kitchen remodeled.

12:40.090 --> 12:41.456
Hey, Rob!

12:41.492 --> 12:43.492
Keep it down--
I have guests out here!

12:43.527 --> 12:44.392
Sorry about that.

12:44.428 --> 12:45.660
You want me to stop?
No.

12:45.696 --> 12:47.562
Just hammer quietly, okay?

12:47.598 --> 12:48.930
AUBREY:
Ms. Bradford,

12:48.966 --> 12:50.398
uh, when was the last time

12:50.434 --> 12:52.167
that you saw your ex-husband?
I don't know.

12:52.202 --> 12:53.668
A couple of months ago.

12:53.704 --> 12:55.470
The cheap son of a bitch
brought me to court trying

12:55.506 --> 12:57.038
to reduce his alimony.
Really?

12:57.074 --> 12:58.840
Yeah, I really see
you're strapped for cash.

12:58.876 --> 13:02.778
Emil had family money, and after
being married to that sad sack,

13:02.813 --> 13:04.446
I deserve every penny I get.

13:04.481 --> 13:06.081
Did you know that Emil

13:06.116 --> 13:07.749
didn't hold down a decent job

13:07.785 --> 13:09.025
the entire time
we were married?

13:09.052 --> 13:10.318
Is that why you beat him?

13:10.354 --> 13:12.487
Excuse me?

13:12.523 --> 13:13.755
Evidence on Emil's corpse

13:13.791 --> 13:14.823
suggests there was
domestic violence

13:14.858 --> 13:16.391
during your marriage.

13:16.426 --> 13:17.859
Maybe you two got into
an argument over alimony,

13:17.895 --> 13:19.261
things got
a little crazy...

13:19.296 --> 13:20.529
Why would I kill the man

13:20.564 --> 13:21.630
that was paying me
ten grand a month

13:21.665 --> 13:23.031
in alimony?

13:23.066 --> 13:24.366
Ms. Bradford,
it's clear that you

13:24.401 --> 13:25.767
and your ex weren't very close,

13:25.803 --> 13:27.002
but is there anything else
you can tell us

13:27.037 --> 13:28.003
about Emil's life

13:28.038 --> 13:29.304
after the divorce?

13:29.339 --> 13:30.672
As far as I know,

13:30.707 --> 13:32.107
there wasn't much of one.

13:32.142 --> 13:34.042
Everything he did
revolved around the stupid

13:34.077 --> 13:36.244
men's rights group
he started.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.046
Men-men's rights?
Yeah.

13:38.081 --> 13:39.381
It's called Men Now.

13:39.416 --> 13:40.549
Is that a legitimate
organization?

13:40.584 --> 13:41.550
Believe me,

13:41.585 --> 13:42.984
I'm as shocked as you are,

13:43.020 --> 13:45.487
but that group
was all he cared about.

13:45.522 --> 13:48.223
Men Now was Emil's whole life.

13:52.262 --> 13:55.063
Hodgins finally got
the trunk of the car open.

13:55.098 --> 13:56.932
He wanted me
to bring you this.

13:56.967 --> 13:59.835
(sighs) He couldn't
bring it himself?

13:59.870 --> 14:01.703
Evidently, he was too busy.

14:01.738 --> 14:02.838
If you want me

14:02.873 --> 14:04.439
to talk to him...
No.

14:04.474 --> 14:07.142
Trust me,
there's really no point.

14:10.914 --> 14:13.014
You're kidding, right?

14:13.050 --> 14:14.649
These papers
are like charcoal.

14:14.685 --> 14:16.351
They're way past
the point of recovery.

14:16.386 --> 14:17.386
Well...

14:17.421 --> 14:18.520
give it your best shot.

14:18.555 --> 14:19.855
If Emil spent
all his time at work,

14:19.890 --> 14:21.590
these may be valuable.
Yeah.

14:21.625 --> 14:23.024
Speaking of Emil,

14:23.060 --> 14:26.094
I did some digging around
in the manosphere.

14:26.129 --> 14:27.162
The what?

14:27.197 --> 14:28.597
Uh, it's the
online community

14:28.632 --> 14:30.565
of blogs and websites

14:30.601 --> 14:32.701
that focus on men's issues.

14:32.736 --> 14:34.669
Remind me why
we love the Internet?

14:34.705 --> 14:37.239
Now, apparently,
it's a burgeoning movement.

14:37.274 --> 14:39.207
You wouldn't believe
how many guys out there

14:39.243 --> 14:40.542
identify themselves

14:40.577 --> 14:42.210
as meninists.

14:42.246 --> 14:44.579
I thought human rights
organizations were supposed

14:44.615 --> 14:48.550
to empower people who
are marginalized or oppressed.

14:48.585 --> 14:51.052
Well, according to Men Now,
oppressed people

14:51.088 --> 14:53.321
include middle-aged white men.

14:53.357 --> 14:54.856
Look at this.

14:54.892 --> 14:57.125
This is a video posted
by the victim.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.660
These so-called feminists

14:58.695 --> 15:01.563
are nothing but a bunch
of Lez-banese man-haters,

15:01.598 --> 15:04.399
and the reason they're
always screaming about

15:04.434 --> 15:05.901
their reproductive rights

15:05.936 --> 15:08.970
is to distract us
from their real plot,

15:09.006 --> 15:12.374
which is getting rid
of the male species.

15:12.409 --> 15:13.808
Oh, good Lord.

15:13.844 --> 15:14.876
Yeah.

15:14.912 --> 15:17.746
And we get
to solve his murder.

15:21.369 --> 15:23.302
(Booth sighs)

15:24.872 --> 15:27.773
I'm sorry, we must be,
uh, at the wrong place.

15:27.808 --> 15:28.874
We're looking for Men Now.

15:28.909 --> 15:29.975
Congratulations,

15:30.011 --> 15:31.443
you've found us. (chuckles)

15:31.479 --> 15:32.611
I'm Karen.

15:32.646 --> 15:33.879
Please, come in.

15:33.914 --> 15:36.415
But y-you're a woman.

15:36.450 --> 15:37.450
Indeed.

15:37.485 --> 15:39.018
Yes, well, lots of us support

15:39.053 --> 15:40.452
the men's rights movement.

15:40.488 --> 15:43.036
Perhaps you would like
to see our brochures?

15:43.037 --> 15:44.028
No, I would not.

15:44.052 --> 15:45.492
BOOTH: We're here
on official business.

15:45.493 --> 15:48.494
FBI, Special Agent Seeley Booth.
And I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan.

15:48.529 --> 15:52.064
Your colleague Emil Bradford's
body was found this morning.

15:52.099 --> 15:53.932
(sighs)

15:53.968 --> 15:56.301
No, no, I-I-I don't believe it.
Oh, my...

15:56.337 --> 15:57.469
When was the last time
you saw him?

15:57.505 --> 15:58.637
It was last Thursday,

15:58.672 --> 16:00.406
here in the office.

16:00.441 --> 16:03.409
He, um, he didn't come in
on Friday, but I just assumed

16:03.444 --> 16:04.943
that he was working from home.

16:04.979 --> 16:06.945
Both he and Paul keep
flexible hours.

16:06.981 --> 16:09.181
Who's Paul?

16:09.216 --> 16:11.350
Um, i-it's my husband.

16:11.385 --> 16:13.819
He and Emil co-founded Men Now.

16:13.854 --> 16:16.088
And I-- you know, I drop
by the office when I can,

16:16.123 --> 16:17.956
but they're the only ones
who work full-time.

16:17.992 --> 16:20.092
Well, is he here now, 'cause
we need to speak with him.

16:20.127 --> 16:21.160
Yes.

16:21.195 --> 16:23.395
Um, but he's in the middle

16:23.431 --> 16:25.197
of a membership meeting
right now.

16:25.232 --> 16:26.498
Really,
because we're in the middle

16:26.534 --> 16:29.001
of a murder investigation.

16:30.438 --> 16:32.905
And I promise, we at Men Now

16:32.940 --> 16:34.740
will never give up the fight.

16:34.775 --> 16:39.011
Not until all fathers are given
equal custody, until women

16:39.046 --> 16:42.114
are required to sign up
for the selective service,

16:42.149 --> 16:46.251
and congress has abolished
all rape shield laws.

16:46.287 --> 16:49.354
(applause)

16:49.390 --> 16:51.156
This guy's gotta
be kidding, right?

16:51.192 --> 16:53.459
Well, actually, his point about
selective service is valid.

16:53.494 --> 16:55.527
Bones, there hasn't been
a draft in 40 years.

16:55.563 --> 16:56.762
Still, it's only fair
that both sexes

16:56.797 --> 16:58.230
be eligible should one occur.

16:58.265 --> 17:01.066
PAUL: And thanks to
the pro-female bias

17:01.102 --> 17:04.703
of the family court system,
the institution of marriage

17:04.738 --> 17:07.138
is now the greatest danger
that men face today.

17:07.174 --> 17:09.007
Let me ask you this...

17:09.042 --> 17:10.476
I don't know what's worse,
this speech,

17:10.511 --> 17:11.477
or the knuckleheads
who agree with him.

17:11.512 --> 17:12.578
Well, personally,

17:12.613 --> 17:14.113
I am not surprised,
considering

17:14.147 --> 17:16.315
that matriarchal societies

17:16.349 --> 17:18.416
held sway
from the Paleolithic era

17:18.452 --> 17:20.252
all the way up to 3000 BCE.

17:20.287 --> 17:22.387
Well, I want to punch
this guy.

17:22.423 --> 17:24.388
All I'm saying is,
if a woman is going

17:24.425 --> 17:27.425
to dress like a slut,
then she might as well

17:27.461 --> 17:30.929
wear a sign saying,
"Rape me now."

17:32.299 --> 17:33.799
I really want to punch this guy.

17:33.834 --> 17:36.401
Hey, you have something
for me to analyze?

17:36.437 --> 17:37.970
Presumably,
a piece of evidence

17:38.005 --> 17:39.938
you couldn't have
walked over to my office.

17:39.974 --> 17:41.974
I thought you'd prefer
if I didn't treat you with pity.

17:42.009 --> 17:43.009
Oh, wow.

17:43.043 --> 17:44.109
How considerate of you.

17:44.145 --> 17:45.410
Take a look at this

17:45.446 --> 17:46.411
blunt force trauma

17:46.447 --> 17:47.579
to the left anterior aspect

17:47.615 --> 17:48.780
of the frontal bone

17:48.816 --> 17:50.616
and also near
the coronal suture.

17:50.651 --> 17:51.750
All perimortem.

17:51.785 --> 17:52.851
I presume that means
that you want me

17:52.887 --> 17:54.486
to swab for particulates,

17:54.522 --> 17:57.156
which also must mean
that you have no clue

17:57.191 --> 17:59.358
what caused the damage.
Not yet,

17:59.393 --> 18:01.260
but according
to my measurements,

18:01.295 --> 18:03.862
those blows were made
by a triangle-shaped object.

18:03.898 --> 18:05.898
I gotta say, I'm not surprised

18:05.933 --> 18:09.101
a jackass like this
was attacked.

18:09.136 --> 18:10.102
I agree.

18:10.137 --> 18:12.471
He had it coming.

18:12.506 --> 18:14.706
Because a man who treats
a woman like dirt,

18:14.742 --> 18:16.241
he's not a man at all.

18:16.277 --> 18:18.076
Really?

18:18.112 --> 18:19.545
What do you call a man

18:19.580 --> 18:22.114
who not-so-subtly passes
judgment on a paraplegic?

18:22.149 --> 18:25.450
For being so honest,
I'd call him a friend.

18:27.288 --> 18:30.789
Tell Dr. Brennan that
I'll have her results shortly.

18:35.696 --> 18:38.030
(sighs)

18:38.065 --> 18:40.632
I, uh, I can't believe
he's gone.

18:40.668 --> 18:42.834
One of the big reasons
we've been growing so quickly

18:42.870 --> 18:44.002
is because of the wonderful

18:44.038 --> 18:45.871
online videos
that Emil and Karen

18:45.906 --> 18:47.873
have been putting together.

18:47.908 --> 18:49.308
We just love going viral.

18:49.343 --> 18:50.542
So do infectious diseases.

18:50.578 --> 18:52.945
BOOTH: Right, uh,
so I guess Men Now

18:52.980 --> 18:55.314
really is taking off.
I guess you'll just have to keep

18:55.349 --> 18:56.748
all those profits to yourself.
Please.

18:56.784 --> 18:59.017
Money means nothing to me.
Right,

18:59.053 --> 19:01.019
which is probably why you're
driving around in those junky cars.

19:01.055 --> 19:02.988
No, we bought those junk boxes

19:03.023 --> 19:05.624
because driving around
in nice cars got too expensive.

19:05.659 --> 19:07.192
I cannot tell you

19:07.228 --> 19:08.560
how many times some feminazi

19:08.596 --> 19:10.095
shattered their windshields

19:10.130 --> 19:11.496
or keyed their cars.

19:11.532 --> 19:13.031
BRENNAN:
Forensic evidence shows

19:13.067 --> 19:15.500
that Emil was struck
multiple times in the head.

19:15.536 --> 19:17.035
Do you know of anyone
who threatened him?

19:17.071 --> 19:18.503
As a matter of fact, I do.

19:18.539 --> 19:19.972
Leah Marino.

19:20.007 --> 19:22.541
She runs the D.C. chapter
of Women for Change.

19:22.576 --> 19:24.710
BRENNAN:
Really? I have been

19:24.745 --> 19:27.579
a member of that organization
since college.

19:27.615 --> 19:29.615
You have? Yes.
KAREN: Oh, well,

19:29.650 --> 19:31.049
that figures a person like you

19:31.085 --> 19:32.384
would be a member
of a sexist group like that.

19:32.419 --> 19:33.852
A sexist?

19:33.887 --> 19:36.755
Uh, WFC promotes equality
for all people.

19:36.790 --> 19:38.357
Everyone knows

19:38.392 --> 19:40.959
affirmative action takes jobs
away from qualified men.

19:40.995 --> 19:43.395
You know what,
why don't we just hold off here

19:43.430 --> 19:44.830
on the women's debate
lecture thing,

19:44.865 --> 19:46.164
and you can tell us
more about Leah Marino.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.232
Well, that woman's
been a thorn

19:47.268 --> 19:49.067
in our side from day one.

19:49.103 --> 19:52.471
Always making nasty
Internet comments,

19:52.506 --> 19:53.772
leading protests
outside our conferences,

19:53.807 --> 19:54.940
and just a few weeks ago,

19:54.975 --> 19:55.841
the bitch,

19:55.876 --> 19:56.975
she hacked, uh,

19:57.011 --> 19:58.744
our Men Now Web site.

19:58.779 --> 20:00.812
She knocked us offline
for two days.

20:00.848 --> 20:02.748
That's a terrible loss.

20:13.761 --> 20:15.894
Is Dr. Brennan back yet?

20:15.929 --> 20:17.629
I got my results
from the swab of the skull.

20:17.665 --> 20:18.597
I haven't seen her,

20:18.632 --> 20:19.965
but you're just in time.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.233
You have to check this out.

20:21.268 --> 20:23.568
If this works
like I think it should,

20:23.604 --> 20:26.338
then this glue will dry
into a solid sheet of rubber.

20:26.373 --> 20:28.407
It's a steel-graphite alloy.

20:28.442 --> 20:31.209
Oh, no, no, i-it's gonna
turn into rubber.

20:31.245 --> 20:32.344
Angela, try to keep up,

20:32.379 --> 20:33.679
all right? I'm talking about

20:33.714 --> 20:35.380
the particulates
that I found in the skull.

20:35.416 --> 20:37.749
That, combined
with the wound's

20:37.785 --> 20:39.117
triangular shape,
could actually point

20:39.153 --> 20:40.319
to a lot of things here, okay.

20:40.354 --> 20:41.553
Could be a nine-iron,

20:41.588 --> 20:43.989
or possibly a-a garden spade,
or maybe

20:44.024 --> 20:44.990
the back of a hammer.

20:45.025 --> 20:46.892
Okay, um, you do realize

20:46.927 --> 20:49.361
that I was right in
the middle of saying something.

20:49.396 --> 20:53.365
All right, and your point is?

20:53.400 --> 20:56.601
Look, I know that
this is hard for you,

20:56.637 --> 20:59.271
but you cannot
treat me like this.

21:00.607 --> 21:04.009
I'm not treating you
like anything.

21:04.044 --> 21:05.210
I'm busy.

21:05.245 --> 21:07.612
Okay.

21:07.648 --> 21:09.548
I just thought
this paper

21:09.583 --> 21:11.817
reconstruction process would be

21:11.852 --> 21:14.619
right up your alley.

21:18.826 --> 21:20.559
Look, see?

21:20.594 --> 21:22.494
It rubberized.

21:22.529 --> 21:24.563
Wow.

21:24.598 --> 21:27.065
Thank you, that was,
uh... (sighs)

21:27.101 --> 21:29.801
that was... really great.

21:40.447 --> 21:41.546
Ah, Dr. Hodgins,

21:41.582 --> 21:42.981
you're just in time.

21:43.016 --> 21:44.716
I was about to set
Pig Man on fire,

21:44.752 --> 21:46.785
but perhaps,

21:46.820 --> 21:49.321
you'd like to do the honors?

21:49.356 --> 21:51.923
Or I could just
do it myself.

21:55.729 --> 21:57.896
(gas hissing)

22:07.274 --> 22:10.709
Wow, that was bigger
than I thought.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.347
BOOTH: <i>You know, you never</i>
<i>told me you were a member</i>

22:15.382 --> 22:16.948
of Women for Change.

22:16.984 --> 22:18.283
I didn't think I had to.

22:18.318 --> 22:19.718
I've received
their monthly newsletter

22:19.753 --> 22:21.553
for the past 20 years.

22:21.588 --> 22:23.422
Who knew I married a bra burner?

22:23.457 --> 22:24.423
Okay.

22:24.458 --> 22:25.757
Women for Change is not

22:25.793 --> 22:28.493
a bunch of'60s radicals.

22:28.529 --> 22:30.529
Oh, yeah,
then why is Leah Marino

22:30.564 --> 22:32.597
leading a protest
down at the Sherborne Hotel?

22:32.633 --> 22:33.698
Because the Sherborne

22:33.734 --> 22:34.833
pays its female employees

22:34.868 --> 22:37.269
two-thirds what a male receives

22:37.304 --> 22:38.703
for the same job.

22:38.739 --> 22:40.906
It's discriminatory
and illogical.

22:40.941 --> 22:44.643
It makes about as much sense
as someone believing in jinxes.

22:44.678 --> 22:46.545
Okay, what about
the butterfly effect?

22:46.580 --> 22:48.246
You're referring
to chaos theory?

22:48.282 --> 22:49.247
That's right.

22:49.283 --> 22:50.715
I read all about it.

22:50.751 --> 22:52.083
A butterfly flaps its wings
in South America,

22:52.119 --> 22:53.585
and it rains in Central Park.
Booth,

22:53.620 --> 22:55.353
I've told you this before,

22:55.389 --> 22:57.789
skimming Wikipedia does not
bolster your arguments.

22:57.825 --> 22:59.491
Okay, look, just face it, Bones.

22:59.526 --> 23:01.159
You are the butterfly.

23:01.195 --> 23:03.195
You're the butterfly, Bones.
You watch the game here,

23:03.230 --> 23:04.630
and it creates chaos
for the Flyers.

23:04.665 --> 23:06.565
That's not even close
to how it works.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.933
Okay, how about we do
an experiment, then?

23:07.968 --> 23:09.401
I'll watch
the Flyers game alone,

23:09.436 --> 23:10.402
and we'll see how they do.

23:10.437 --> 23:12.237
Okay, your hypothesis being

23:12.272 --> 23:14.606
the Flyers will win
unless I'm there to watch?

23:14.641 --> 23:16.408
I got a great idea;
why don't we skip the game

23:16.443 --> 23:19.244
and I take you out
for a romantic dinner?

23:19.279 --> 23:21.146
You're that desperate
No.

23:21.181 --> 23:22.914
to keep me away from the Flyers?
Come on.

23:22.950 --> 23:25.150
It was worth a shot.

23:25.185 --> 23:27.018
PROTESTORS (chanting):
Wage equality now!

23:27.054 --> 23:28.587
Wage equality now!

23:28.622 --> 23:32.457
Wage equality now!
Wage equality now!

23:32.493 --> 23:33.925
Wage equality now!

23:33.961 --> 23:37.462
Wage equality now!
Wage equality now!

23:37.464 --> 23:39.179
This crowd's a lot bigger
and angrier than I thought.

23:39.180 --> 23:40.966
Wage equality now!
Well...age equality now!

23:41.001 --> 23:43.001
Women for Change
practices nonviolence.

23:43.036 --> 23:45.003
I'm sure it's
a peaceful demonstration.

23:45.038 --> 23:47.272
Right, because Leah Marino,
she is so peaceful.

23:47.307 --> 23:49.407
All right, what about
these tweets here?

23:49.443 --> 23:52.677
Ah, "Suicide is never an option
except for Emil Bradford."

23:52.713 --> 23:53.945
Oh, how about this one:

23:53.981 --> 23:56.248
"Raise your hand
if you want Emil Bradford

23:56.283 --> 23:57.782
to die a slow,
painful death."

23:57.818 --> 23:59.651
Oh. Booth, there she is.

23:59.686 --> 24:02.454
...and we'll stay here
till the Sherborne Hotel

24:02.489 --> 24:06.525
pays their female employees
the same wage it pays the men.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.560
(crowd cheering)

24:08.595 --> 24:11.029
Leah Marino, FBI,
Special Agent Seeley Booth.

24:11.064 --> 24:12.197
We need to talk to you.

24:12.232 --> 24:13.765
So, look what we have here.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.667
Looks like Sherborne wants
to play hardball, huh?

24:15.702 --> 24:17.035
BRENNAN:
This has nothing to do

24:17.070 --> 24:18.470
with, uh, equal pay.

24:18.505 --> 24:19.538
We need to speak to you
about the death of...

24:19.573 --> 24:20.772
I guess those

24:20.807 --> 24:22.440
corporate fat cats
at the Sherborne

24:22.476 --> 24:24.576
must be getting scared

24:24.611 --> 24:26.311
since they sent these FBI agents

24:26.346 --> 24:29.147
to come and arrest me.
(crowd booing)

24:29.182 --> 24:30.649
We're not here to arrest you.
No.

24:30.684 --> 24:32.083
I'm not scared
of these government goons,

24:32.119 --> 24:33.585
and you shouldn't
be scared either,

24:33.620 --> 24:36.288
because when it comes
to ending the wage gap,

24:36.323 --> 24:40.325
the only thing we should fear
is our own complacency.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.260
(crowd cheering)
So, if you have to arrest me,

24:42.296 --> 24:43.662
arrest me.

24:43.697 --> 24:45.163
Okay, let's go,
let's go, come on.

24:45.198 --> 24:46.932
Let her go!
Male oppressor!

24:46.967 --> 24:48.433
How's it feel working
for the man?

24:48.468 --> 24:49.901
Oh, no, no, no,

24:49.937 --> 24:52.003
I-I support you.
I-I'm actually a card-carrying

24:52.039 --> 24:53.572
member of Women For Change.

24:53.607 --> 24:54.873
I support you.

24:54.908 --> 24:56.575
Wage equality now!

24:56.610 --> 24:59.244
ALL (chanting): Wage equality now!
Wage equality now!

25:01.030 --> 25:05.192
Ms. Marino, reading the hateful
comments that you posted online,

25:05.292 --> 25:07.859
I'd say that you were at war
with Emil Bradford.

25:07.895 --> 25:10.462
I never intended
to stoop to his level,

25:10.497 --> 25:14.733
but I wasn't about to let
his nasty, uninformed rhetoric

25:14.768 --> 25:16.501
undo 50 years of progress.

25:16.537 --> 25:19.571
So, hacking the Men Now
Web site was, what,

25:19.607 --> 25:22.374
your way of extending
an olive branch?

25:22.409 --> 25:24.309
More like an act
of desperation.

25:24.345 --> 25:25.944
I thought if
I did something big,

25:25.980 --> 25:27.312
Emil would stop harassing me.

25:27.348 --> 25:28.348
I've read your tweets.

25:28.382 --> 25:30.148
You gave as good as you got.

25:30.184 --> 25:31.817
I'm not talking about
the online stuff.

25:31.852 --> 25:34.720
Emil got off on destroying
people's lives.

25:34.755 --> 25:36.788
I can't tell you
how many times he stood

25:36.824 --> 25:38.890
outside my home or my work,

25:38.926 --> 25:41.827
shouting insults
through his bullhorn.

25:41.862 --> 25:43.228
Once, he even showed up

25:43.264 --> 25:44.630
outside of
a restaurant.

25:44.665 --> 25:46.105
So, why not file
a restraining order?

25:46.133 --> 25:47.266
I was about to,

25:47.301 --> 25:49.368
then two weeks ago,
it all stopped.

25:49.403 --> 25:53.005
So, you're saying he just up
and left you alone.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.840
Why would he do that?
My guess is

25:54.875 --> 25:57.743
he found someone new to harass.

25:59.713 --> 26:03.382
Ah, his cell phone records show
that Emil's ex-wife was right

26:03.417 --> 26:06.218
about him not
having a normal life.

26:06.253 --> 26:07.519
It appears
the majority of his calls

26:07.554 --> 26:09.388
were made to
Karen and Paul Walters.

26:09.423 --> 26:11.523
Talk about somebody who needs
some decency beaten into him.

26:11.558 --> 26:13.859
While I agree
the Walters are infuriating,

26:13.894 --> 26:15.334
that's no excuse
for violence, Booth.

26:15.362 --> 26:17.529
Bones, I didn't say
I was gonna beat him up,

26:17.564 --> 26:19.298
I just like thinking about it,
that's all.

26:19.333 --> 26:20.832
I've been doing
some thinking as well

26:20.868 --> 26:22.200
about tonight's game.

26:22.236 --> 26:24.136
You thinking about not watching it?
No.

26:24.171 --> 26:25.068
I was thinking about
what pizza to order.

26:25.092 --> 26:26.606
Oh, come on, Bones,

26:26.607 --> 26:28.573
you gotta be kidding me, really?
You don't care about hockey

26:28.609 --> 26:30.375
your whole life,
and all of a sudden

26:30.411 --> 26:31.743
this one game comes up
and you just can't let it go.

26:31.779 --> 26:33.445
Perhaps it's you
who needs to relinquish

26:33.480 --> 26:35.180
your primitive superstitions.

26:35.215 --> 26:36.181
All right,
wait a second.

26:36.216 --> 26:38.283
I might have something here.

26:38.319 --> 26:40.719
The last signal picked up
was from a Wi-Fi

26:40.754 --> 26:43.322
account XYZ123

26:43.357 --> 26:44.489
Thursday night at 10:00 p.m.

26:44.525 --> 26:45.624
That's the last day

26:45.659 --> 26:47.092
that Emil was seen alive.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.560
Yeah, the only problem is

26:48.595 --> 26:49.928
it came from a hot-spot meaning,

26:49.963 --> 26:51.196
it came from
somebody else's phone.

26:51.231 --> 26:52.764
Well, if we can track down

26:52.800 --> 26:54.232
the person who owns
that hot-spot,

26:54.268 --> 26:56.335
we'll know who Emil
was with that night.

26:58.372 --> 26:59.905
Cam, if you can pull yourself

26:59.940 --> 27:02.040
away from the human sausage
for a second,

27:02.076 --> 27:03.342
I've got some actual data
to share.

27:03.377 --> 27:04.609
Sure, go right ahead.

27:04.645 --> 27:05.911
Turns out, the vehicle's head

27:05.946 --> 27:07.112
and taillights
weren't shattered

27:07.147 --> 27:08.313
in the accident.

27:08.349 --> 27:09.581
So, someone
smashed up Emil's car

27:09.616 --> 27:11.083
before it went off the road?
It looks that way,

27:11.118 --> 27:12.651
and when I swabbed
the glass for particulates,

27:12.686 --> 27:13.785
I found traces of steel alloy.

27:13.821 --> 27:15.487
The same material that caused

27:15.522 --> 27:16.755
the fractures to his skull.

27:16.790 --> 27:18.623
Nice work.
Yeah, I wish I could say

27:18.659 --> 27:20.025
the same for you,
because without proper

27:20.060 --> 27:21.593
ventilation for the build-up
of methane gas,

27:21.628 --> 27:23.395
your little male
chauvinist pig there

27:23.430 --> 27:25.094
is not gonna just cook,
he's gonna explode.

27:25.118 --> 27:25.832
‭Well...

27:25.833 --> 27:27.799
perhaps you'd like
to help me correct that?

27:27.835 --> 27:29.801
(scoffs)
Not a chance, uh-uh.

27:29.837 --> 27:31.703
No, I'm keeping as far away
from that pork balloon

27:31.739 --> 27:33.739
as possible.

27:38.545 --> 27:42.881
Oh, wow, uh,
I'm so sorry about that.

27:45.386 --> 27:47.052
(sighs heavily)

27:52.459 --> 27:55.260
So, after converting
the victim's burnt papers

27:55.295 --> 27:58.697
to a rubberized sheet,
I was able to scan and upload

27:58.732 --> 28:00.932
the image to a video
spectral comparator.

28:00.968 --> 28:02.734
Okay...

28:02.770 --> 28:04.069
are we supposed
to be seeing something?

28:04.104 --> 28:05.771
Yeah, in a sec.

28:05.806 --> 28:08.173
The carbonized image
can only be viewed

28:08.208 --> 28:11.176
by an infrared light source.

28:11.211 --> 28:13.378
FUENTES:
That's unexpected.

28:13.414 --> 28:15.280
I would have gone with creepy.

28:15.315 --> 28:17.115
MONTENEGRO: Yeah, that's why
I called you guys in here.

28:17.151 --> 28:19.217
Well, there has
to be something else.

28:19.253 --> 28:20.419
Yeah, I agree.

28:20.454 --> 28:21.420
Let me adjust

28:21.455 --> 28:23.789
the light spectrum.

28:23.824 --> 28:24.824
FUENTES:
"Right to choose?

28:24.858 --> 28:26.425
Some of us never
got the chance."

28:26.460 --> 28:27.392
Hold on...

28:27.428 --> 28:28.360
is that baby holding his...

28:28.395 --> 28:29.428
Mm-hmm.
Looks like it.

28:29.463 --> 28:30.529
"Men,

28:30.564 --> 28:31.596
"if you were circumcised

28:31.632 --> 28:32.731
"against your wishes,

28:32.766 --> 28:34.599
you can fight back."

28:34.635 --> 28:35.867
These flyers

28:35.903 --> 28:38.069
are targeted at a

28:38.105 --> 28:39.304
Dr. Pamela Gould.

28:39.339 --> 28:40.439
That explains
why the victim

28:40.474 --> 28:41.973
stopped targeting Leah Marino.

28:42.009 --> 28:43.408
Men Now was building

28:43.444 --> 28:46.044
a class-action lawsuit
against Dr. Gould

28:46.079 --> 28:47.779
for performing
these circumcisions.

28:47.815 --> 28:48.914
That can't really

28:48.949 --> 28:50.682
be a thing, can it?
I read about

28:50.717 --> 28:51.783
lawsuits like this.

28:51.819 --> 28:54.052
In each case,
the plaintiffs won.

28:54.087 --> 28:55.053
On what grounds?

28:55.088 --> 28:56.188
Apparently, all the former

28:56.223 --> 28:57.289
patients have to prove

28:57.324 --> 28:58.590
is that the circumcision

28:58.625 --> 29:00.325
was performed
without their consent.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.160
(scoffs)
What consent?

29:02.196 --> 29:05.096
We had Michael Vincent
snipped at two days old.

29:05.132 --> 29:06.298
That is a shame.

29:06.333 --> 29:08.834
In Cuba, very few boys
are circumcised.

29:08.869 --> 29:11.837
Did you know that having
a foreskin greatly enhances

29:11.872 --> 29:13.505
a man's sexual pleasure?

29:13.540 --> 29:15.941
There is no scientific proof
of that, Dr. Fuentes.

29:15.976 --> 29:20.378
No, but I have
ample anecdotal evidence.

29:20.414 --> 29:21.079
Mm-hmm.

29:21.114 --> 29:22.147
Mm.

29:22.182 --> 29:23.648
So, Dr. Gould

29:23.684 --> 29:25.417
must not have been happy
about Bradford

29:25.452 --> 29:27.452
distributing these flyers.

29:27.488 --> 29:29.054
Well, perhaps next time,

29:29.089 --> 29:30.589
she'll be more careful
with her scissors.

29:30.624 --> 29:32.591
You can laugh,
but a lawsuit like this

29:32.626 --> 29:34.326
could potentially bankrupt
a medical practice.

29:34.361 --> 29:35.327
Sounds like motive

29:35.362 --> 29:37.128
for murder to me.

29:45.809 --> 29:48.944
I talked to your secretary,
Dr. Gould.

29:48.979 --> 29:51.379
She said that she saw
Emil handing these out

29:51.415 --> 29:53.848
at the hospital's main
entrance last Thursday.

29:53.884 --> 29:55.617
It also happens to be

29:55.652 --> 29:57.953
one of the last times
anyone saw him alive.

29:57.988 --> 30:00.622
(sighs) That man was outside
the hospital every day

30:00.657 --> 30:02.290
for the last two weeks,
trying to recruit patients

30:02.326 --> 30:03.858
for that ridiculous
lawsuit of his.

30:03.894 --> 30:08.230
I've also got witnesses
who saw you confront Emil.

30:08.265 --> 30:10.565
We may have had a few words.

30:10.601 --> 30:11.733
So what?

30:14.438 --> 30:15.870
You recognize that?

30:15.906 --> 30:17.539
I believe that's the tire iron

30:17.574 --> 30:19.507
I keep in the trunk of my car.

30:19.543 --> 30:21.076
Coincidentally,
made from the same

30:21.111 --> 30:23.278
steel-graphite alloy
that we found

30:23.313 --> 30:25.313
in the victim's
headlights and face.

30:25.349 --> 30:29.084
Okay, I admit it, I hit his car,
but I swear I never touched him.

30:29.119 --> 30:31.152
I think you snapped.

30:31.188 --> 30:32.621
You couldn't bear
the thought

30:32.656 --> 30:34.522
of Bradford destroying
your medical practice,

30:34.558 --> 30:36.524
so you decided
to get rid of him first.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.261
Look, vandalizing Emil's car
was not my proudest moment,

30:39.296 --> 30:41.596
but that doesn't mean
I killed him.

30:41.632 --> 30:45.233
In fact, after I was done
taking out my aggressions,

30:45.269 --> 30:47.936
Emil and I had a nice little
talk about the whole thing,

30:47.971 --> 30:49.004
and he apologized.

30:49.039 --> 30:51.006
Emil Bradford apologized?

30:51.041 --> 30:52.974
After you smashed up his car?

30:53.010 --> 30:54.676
It was shocking, but yes.

30:54.711 --> 30:58.947
He claimed our talk helped him
see the error of his ways,

30:58.982 --> 31:00.782
and he was turning
over a new leaf.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.817
I'm telling you,
it's the truth.

31:02.853 --> 31:07.222
He even talked
about disbanding Men Now.

31:09.326 --> 31:12.060
If Emil was planning
to shutter Men Now,

31:12.095 --> 31:15.096
I imagine it would have driven
Paul and Karen Walters

31:15.132 --> 31:16.564
even crazier
than they already are.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.534
Are you implying Men Now
has no legitimate issues?

31:19.569 --> 31:20.835
Are you implying they do?

31:20.871 --> 31:22.003
Well, in some cases.

31:22.039 --> 31:23.772
For example,
I think that men

31:23.807 --> 31:27.842
are entitled to equal custody
in divorce settlements.

31:27.878 --> 31:28.910
Perhaps,

31:28.945 --> 31:30.645
but does it really justify

31:30.681 --> 31:33.948
the existence
of a men's rights group?

31:33.984 --> 31:36.017
Everyone knows
it's a man's world.

31:36.053 --> 31:37.919
Well, I think it
should be an equal one.

31:37.954 --> 31:39.187
Dr. Brennan,

31:39.222 --> 31:41.389
I've identified
evulsion fractures

31:41.425 --> 31:43.958
of the inferior margin
of the C4

31:43.994 --> 31:46.161
and the superior margin
of the C5 vertebrae.

31:46.196 --> 31:47.729
The extensive fracturing
from the fire

31:47.764 --> 31:48.863
must have obscured them.

31:48.899 --> 31:49.831
Looking at this

31:49.866 --> 31:51.232
pattern of damage,

31:51.268 --> 31:53.234
it's all beginning
to make sense.

31:53.270 --> 31:54.769
First, the victim

31:54.805 --> 31:56.137
was smashed in the face

31:56.173 --> 31:58.840
with a blunt, triangular object.

31:58.875 --> 32:01.109
Injuring his hands and forearms
as he tried to defend himself.

32:01.144 --> 32:02.510
Then, the force

32:02.546 --> 32:05.580
of the blows pushed him
backward and caused him

32:05.615 --> 32:07.449
to fall and hit his neck

32:07.484 --> 32:10.719
on something with a sharp,
horizontal edge.

32:10.754 --> 32:12.687
Given this scenario,
this damage to the vertebrae

32:12.723 --> 32:14.122
would have severed
the victim's spinal cord,

32:14.157 --> 32:15.323
causing death.

32:15.359 --> 32:16.658
But we still haven't identified

32:16.693 --> 32:17.859
the object that hit him

32:17.894 --> 32:20.495
or the location
where he was killed.

32:20.530 --> 32:21.730
If Emil was

32:21.765 --> 32:24.132
truly breaking
his ties to Men Now,

32:24.167 --> 32:26.568
I'm guessing it had something
to do with Paul Walters.

32:26.603 --> 32:28.470
Well, that is
a sexist assumption.

32:28.505 --> 32:30.271
The killer could be

32:30.307 --> 32:32.440
his wife, Karen.

32:32.476 --> 32:33.875
That was meant as a compliment.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.243
And I suppose

32:35.278 --> 32:37.579
you think that women
should feel flattered

32:37.614 --> 32:40.215
when they are catcalled
walking down the street?

32:40.250 --> 32:42.384
I know I do.

32:42.419 --> 32:45.220
Is this something that happens
to you frequently, Dr. Fuentes?

32:45.255 --> 32:46.688
Oh, yes.

32:46.723 --> 32:47.989
They either call to me,

32:48.024 --> 32:51.593
or simply make love to me
with their eyes.

32:52.496 --> 32:53.628
Though based on the

32:53.663 --> 32:55.029
daggers your eyes are sending,

32:55.065 --> 32:56.431
I will concede
that it is possible

32:56.466 --> 32:59.067
for a woman to be a killer.

33:07.477 --> 33:08.610
Wow.

33:08.645 --> 33:10.311
I guess one human bratwurst

33:10.347 --> 33:11.679
wasn't enough for you, huh?

33:11.715 --> 33:14.249
Well, I was hoping
to make Pig Man Two

33:14.284 --> 33:16.818
with your husband's
participation.

33:16.853 --> 33:18.653
I appreciate what
you're trying to do, Cam,

33:18.688 --> 33:20.388
but there is no helping Hodgins

33:20.424 --> 33:22.023
right now.

33:22.058 --> 33:24.392
You can take off those gloves.

33:24.428 --> 33:26.628
I haven't even loaded the entrails yet.
Oh, good,

33:26.663 --> 33:28.797
because the algorithm
that I came up with

33:28.832 --> 33:30.899
makes Sausage Boy

33:30.934 --> 33:33.201
irrelevant.
Oh, thank God.

33:33.236 --> 33:36.037
So, you figured out when
the victim's body was dumped?

33:36.072 --> 33:38.573
Based on my calculations,
it was last Thursday night,

33:38.608 --> 33:40.842
sometime between
midnight and 4:00 a.m.

33:40.877 --> 33:42.076
That's great.

33:42.112 --> 33:43.545
Though it would've been better

33:43.580 --> 33:45.246
had you told me two hours ago.

33:45.282 --> 33:46.815
Well, also, get this--

33:46.850 --> 33:51.586
I tracked down the owner
of that mobile hotspot, XYZ123.

33:51.621 --> 33:55.223
That's the last Wi-Fi signal
Emil's phone picked up?

33:55.258 --> 33:57.725
Yeah, and I traced it
to Karen Walters' phone.

34:00.897 --> 34:02.397
You know what, you lied to us.

34:02.432 --> 34:04.065
We have phone records that show
that you were with Emil

34:04.100 --> 34:05.733
right before he died.
BRENNAN: According to Dr. Gould,

34:05.769 --> 34:07.702
Emil was turning over
a new leaf,

34:07.737 --> 34:09.237
possibly shutting down Men Now,

34:09.272 --> 34:11.239
which must have made you
quite angry.

34:11.274 --> 34:12.474
Angry enough to kill.

34:12.509 --> 34:13.942
No, you have
this all wrong.

34:13.976 --> 34:16.311
Emil wasn't  going anywhere.
Dr. Gould

34:16.346 --> 34:17.946
was very precise
about the words Emil used.

34:17.981 --> 34:19.414
Yeah, well,

34:19.449 --> 34:21.382
I can quote them, too,
because I wrote them.

34:21.418 --> 34:22.951
That, the stuff
that Emil said about,

34:22.985 --> 34:25.553
"Seeing the error of his ways,"

34:25.589 --> 34:27.188
that was a line
that we would use

34:27.224 --> 34:30.625
whenever we had run-ins
with angry feminists.

34:30.659 --> 34:32.527
Turns out that lying
is a lot less painful

34:32.562 --> 34:33.695
than having
your face smashed in.

34:33.730 --> 34:35.295
Okay, assume
that we believe you.

34:35.331 --> 34:37.031
You still haven't
answered our question.

34:37.067 --> 34:40.835
What were you doing with Emil
the night that he died?

34:42.105 --> 34:43.438
Your husband was with you

34:43.473 --> 34:45.172
the last time we met,
Mrs. Walters.

34:45.208 --> 34:48.342
Perhaps you neglected to mention
your late night meetings

34:48.378 --> 34:53.481
with Emil
because the two of you

34:53.516 --> 34:56.618
All right,
you know what...

34:56.652 --> 34:58.052
Let our lawyers
handle this.

34:58.088 --> 34:59.387
You know what,
you need to step outside.

34:59.422 --> 35:00.955
The lawyers, they can stay.
Paul...

35:00.991 --> 35:02.590
I can take care of this.

35:02.626 --> 35:04.392
No, there's only one thing
you're going to do,

35:04.427 --> 35:05.693
and that's keep
your damn mouth shut.

35:05.729 --> 35:07.462
Mrs. Walters,
as a proponent

35:07.497 --> 35:10.398
for equality between sexes,

35:10.433 --> 35:11.933
I am shocked
you'd allow your husband

35:11.968 --> 35:13.501
to speak to you
like that.

35:13.537 --> 35:14.802
That one likes flapping
her gums, doesn't she?

35:14.838 --> 35:15.670
You might want
to get a muzzle on her.

35:15.705 --> 35:17.305
Outside.
That idea

35:17.340 --> 35:18.373
is not only misogynistic,

35:18.408 --> 35:20.408
it's downright sociopathic.

35:20.443 --> 35:21.609
What can I say?

35:21.645 --> 35:23.378
All bitches need
to be muzzled sometime.

35:23.413 --> 35:24.746
I suggest you
stop talking

35:24.781 --> 35:25.813
before I do something
we both regret.

35:25.849 --> 35:27.181
Booth, stop.

35:27.217 --> 35:29.450
You could lose your job
for striking a civilian.

35:29.486 --> 35:31.619
Whereas, I...

35:31.655 --> 35:33.721
might face
disciplinary action at most.

35:34.591 --> 35:35.990
I think his jaw is broken.

35:36.026 --> 35:37.325
We'll be filing charges
of criminal assault

35:37.360 --> 35:39.460
against this woman.
As well as a civil suit.

35:39.496 --> 35:41.329
I told you, she needs to be muzzled.
Back off.

35:41.364 --> 35:44.299
Actually, the problem isn't
my mouth, it's yours.

35:46.926 --> 35:48.874
I got to tell you,
Dr. Brennan's got

35:48.875 --> 35:50.469
a mean right hook
for a squint.

35:50.473 --> 35:51.683
Yeah, well,
I think my hand's

35:51.684 --> 35:53.151
gonna feel worse than hers

35:53.186 --> 35:54.986
after filling out
all these incident reports.

35:55.021 --> 35:56.587
Ouch.

35:56.623 --> 35:58.256
So, I take it Karen Walters
still isn't talking?

35:58.291 --> 35:59.824
Nope, not a word.

35:59.859 --> 36:01.692
What about the piece
of work she's married to?

36:01.728 --> 36:03.895
No, you know what,
his jaw is so swollen,

36:03.930 --> 36:05.730
he couldn't talk
if he wanted to.

36:05.765 --> 36:07.732
Okay, so, we know that
Karen and Emil were together

36:07.767 --> 36:10.034
a few hours before he
was killed, but the question is,

36:10.069 --> 36:11.736
if they weren't
having an affair,

36:11.771 --> 36:12.532
what the hell
were they doing?

36:12.556 --> 36:13.738
Well, it's got to be

36:13.740 --> 36:15.406
something illegal,
or she would talk.

36:15.442 --> 36:17.475
Unless Karen's our killer.

36:17.510 --> 36:19.744
My gut says no,
but something's definitely up.

36:19.779 --> 36:21.612
Well, so you know,
I talked to Karen's boss

36:21.648 --> 36:22.847
over at RGT Home
Security Systems.

36:22.882 --> 36:24.348
Now, he says that

36:24.384 --> 36:26.250
she clocked in at 9:00
the night of the murder,

36:26.286 --> 36:28.653
didn't punch out
until 6:00 a.m. the next day.

36:28.688 --> 36:30.888
Yeah, fine, I'll just get
a warrant for her work computer,

36:30.924 --> 36:34.058
'cause if she was working
that night, I want to know why.

36:34.093 --> 36:36.327
FUENTES:
If a male FBI consultant

36:36.362 --> 36:37.929
broke a suspect's jaw,

36:37.964 --> 36:39.864
I imagine he'd be sitting
in a jail cell by now.

36:39.899 --> 36:41.332
Well, if prison
had been an option,

36:41.367 --> 36:43.201
I would never have struck him
in the first place.

36:43.236 --> 36:45.670
But you will receive
some form of punishment?

36:45.705 --> 36:48.139
Booth has submitted
the proper paperwork,

36:48.174 --> 36:51.275
and it will receive
an unbiased review by the FBI.

36:51.311 --> 36:53.144
I can only imagine
the catcalls you're gonna get

36:53.179 --> 36:55.480
when you're picking up trash
on the side of the road.

36:55.515 --> 36:56.547
That...

36:56.583 --> 36:57.682
doesn't make any sense.

36:57.717 --> 36:58.816
I thought community service

36:58.852 --> 37:01.018
was a common
disciplinary action.

37:01.054 --> 37:02.220
Not that.

37:02.255 --> 37:03.387
The victim's frontal bone.

37:03.423 --> 37:06.090
It has a strange
burn mark on it.

37:06.125 --> 37:08.059
The body was in a car fire.

37:08.094 --> 37:09.193
There's not an inch of it

37:09.229 --> 37:10.228
that isn't covered with burns.

37:10.263 --> 37:12.497
But those were
made postmortem.

37:12.532 --> 37:14.532
When necrotized bone
is burned,

37:14.567 --> 37:15.800
there's usually evidence

37:15.835 --> 37:17.435
of linear
and longitudinal fractures.

37:17.470 --> 37:19.837
And when live bone
is burned,

37:19.873 --> 37:22.807
the fracture lines tend
to be crescent-shaped,

37:22.842 --> 37:24.141
like this.

37:24.177 --> 37:25.943
So, the victim was hit
repeatedly in the head

37:25.979 --> 37:28.079
with a blunt,
triangle-shaped object

37:28.114 --> 37:29.514
that was also burning hot?

37:29.549 --> 37:31.249
That's it, Dr. Fuentes.

37:31.284 --> 37:32.483
It is?

37:32.519 --> 37:35.286
The victim was struck
by an iron.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.154
Hey, so, Cam just called

37:37.190 --> 37:38.389
from Paul
and Karen Walter's house.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.024
No sign of blood on their iron.

37:40.059 --> 37:41.592
Any luck busting Karen's alibi?

37:41.628 --> 37:43.060
Well, her work computer confirms

37:43.096 --> 37:44.362
she was there the whole night,

37:44.397 --> 37:46.764
but I did find
something interesting.

37:49.135 --> 37:51.035
Okay, so, it looks like

37:51.070 --> 37:53.571
Karen shut down one of her
clients' home security systems

37:53.606 --> 37:56.941
between the hours
of 10:30 and 11:30 p.m.

37:56.976 --> 37:59.277
Yeah, and guess
whose house it was.

38:00.380 --> 38:02.480
That's Gail Bradford's
address.

38:02.515 --> 38:04.982
Karen used her job
at RGT Home Security

38:05.018 --> 38:08.019
to help Emil break
into his ex-wife's house.

38:08.054 --> 38:09.287
That explains
why Karen lied

38:09.322 --> 38:11.022
about being with Emil
that night.

38:11.057 --> 38:14.191
Shutting down
a client's security system

38:14.227 --> 38:15.793
isn't just grounds
it could get her arrested.

38:15.828 --> 38:16.994
Now the only question is

38:17.030 --> 38:18.030
why she did it.

38:18.064 --> 38:19.463
Yeah, something tells me

38:19.499 --> 38:20.965
Karen isn't going
to be giving that up.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.366
I think it's time
we have another chat

38:22.402 --> 38:24.702
with Emil's ex-wife.

38:24.737 --> 38:25.937
I'm getting déjà vu.

38:25.972 --> 38:27.338
Didn't we do this once already?

38:27.373 --> 38:29.013
Well, this time,
we have a search warrant.

38:29.042 --> 38:30.508
Which way is
your laundry room?

38:30.543 --> 38:32.009
Who said I had
a laundry room?

38:32.045 --> 38:38.015
I'll find it myself.

38:38.051 --> 38:41.719
(Booth whistles).

38:41.754 --> 38:44.155
And what possible reason
would he have to do that?

38:46.225 --> 38:48.459
(sighs)
Well, I don't know.

38:48.494 --> 38:50.261
Maybe these, uh, these shirts,

38:50.296 --> 38:52.730
these shoes here,
oh, look at that,

38:52.765 --> 38:54.065
these magazines.

38:54.100 --> 38:55.566
I like to read the articles.

38:55.602 --> 38:56.567
Right, don't we all?

38:56.603 --> 38:58.235
(scoffs)

38:58.271 --> 39:01.339
Emil shut off the security
system so he could get proof

39:01.374 --> 39:03.240
that you
and your contractor were

39:03.276 --> 39:04.537
(clicks tongue) shacking up.

39:04.538 --> 39:05.800
Why would he care
about me and Rob?

39:05.801 --> 39:08.379
Because if he could proof
that you two were shacking up,

39:08.414 --> 39:09.447
he wouldn't have
to pay you alimony.

39:09.482 --> 39:10.781
AUBREY:
Booth...

39:10.817 --> 39:11.983
I found the iron.

39:12.018 --> 39:13.184
It's got blood on it.
Blood?

39:13.219 --> 39:14.418
Gail, maybe we
should just

39:14.454 --> 39:15.920
tell them the truth.

39:15.955 --> 39:17.488
It might make them
go easier on us.

39:19.292 --> 39:21.125
"On us"?

39:21.160 --> 39:22.326
No.

39:22.362 --> 39:23.628
He's the one who did it.

39:24.864 --> 39:27.131
It was terrible,
the way he kept bashing

39:27.166 --> 39:28.933
Emil in the face,
and then he forced me

39:28.968 --> 39:31.202
to help him get rid of the body.
I didn't want to do it,

39:31.237 --> 39:32.536
but I was afraid
that if I didn't,

39:32.572 --> 39:34.372
that he would--
he would kill me, too.

39:34.407 --> 39:36.040
She's lying.

39:36.075 --> 39:37.074
Everything she said
is the exact opposite

39:37.110 --> 39:38.776
of what happened.
Yeah.

39:38.811 --> 39:40.211
Let's go.
She hits me, you know.

39:40.246 --> 39:41.445
Okay, you two
can bicker

39:41.481 --> 39:42.813
on the way down
when you get booked.

39:42.849 --> 39:44.682
Let's go.

39:51.357 --> 39:53.557
Hey, are you ready to...

39:53.593 --> 39:55.393
to go?

40:08.775 --> 40:10.107
HODGINS:
Angela.

40:10.143 --> 40:11.375
Hey.

40:11.411 --> 40:13.444
What are you doing?
Oh...

40:13.479 --> 40:14.912
I-I'm sorry, I-I didn't

40:14.947 --> 40:15.913
mean to, but...

40:15.948 --> 40:17.014
honey, that is--

40:17.050 --> 40:18.349
that's so great.

40:18.384 --> 40:20.484
You-you joined a support group.
Yeah, I did.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.753
It's nothing. Can we just,
can we go home now?

40:22.789 --> 40:26.557
Yeah, yeah, okay, but...

40:26.592 --> 40:28.492
why wouldn't you want
to share that with me?

40:28.528 --> 40:30.194
I am so proud
of you, honey.

40:30.229 --> 40:31.229
This is gonna help

40:31.264 --> 40:32.697
everything so much.
Angela...

40:32.732 --> 40:34.098
I really, really don't want

40:34.133 --> 40:35.700
to talk about it, okay?

40:35.735 --> 40:36.867
Look, I know

40:36.903 --> 40:38.002
this is a process,

40:38.037 --> 40:39.303
but you're doing the work,

40:39.338 --> 40:41.372
and... everything
is gonna be okay.

40:41.407 --> 40:44.041
No. It's not.

40:44.077 --> 40:45.876
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

40:45.912 --> 40:48.212
At least the people online,
you know,

40:48.247 --> 40:49.980
they're-they're honest,
you know.

40:50.016 --> 40:52.650
They-they know that
I'm not gonna just snap back

40:52.685 --> 40:55.753
and be the person
that I was before.

40:55.788 --> 40:57.788
Okay, um...

40:57.824 --> 40:59.990
I'm trying my best here,
Hodgins.

41:00.026 --> 41:01.292
Y-you do not have to yell at me.

41:01.327 --> 41:03.127
You think this is me
being hard on you?

41:03.162 --> 41:07.331
'Cause you have no clue
how much anger I'm holding back.

41:07.366 --> 41:10.267
So, you can either
deal with this, or go.

41:10.303 --> 41:11.669
You know what,
you should.

41:11.704 --> 41:13.537
Yeah, Angela,
you should, you should go,

41:13.573 --> 41:15.506
because I promise you

41:15.541 --> 41:18.109
this is not gonna
get any easier.

41:34.193 --> 41:35.893
All right, come on, Bones,
what are you talking about?

41:35.928 --> 41:37.161
Gail totally did it.

41:37.196 --> 41:38.596
Well,
anthropologically speaking,

41:38.631 --> 41:40.865
men commit
a disproportionately high number

41:40.900 --> 41:43.801
of violent acts
as compared to women.

41:43.836 --> 41:46.203
(groans) All right, okay,
that's just great,

41:46.239 --> 41:48.405
coming from somebody
who coldclocked the suspect.

41:48.441 --> 41:50.508
Well, uh,
an action which I regret,

41:50.543 --> 41:52.443
despite the enjoyment
I felt in the moment.

41:52.478 --> 41:53.778
All I'm saying is,

41:53.813 --> 41:55.412
no matter what,
the judge is probably gonna

41:55.448 --> 41:57.581
go easier on her
because she's a woman.

41:57.617 --> 41:59.283
Well, it's bias like that

41:59.318 --> 42:02.086
which fuels
the men's rights movement.

42:02.121 --> 42:03.454
You know, you are
a very complicated woman,

42:03.489 --> 42:04.889
you know--

42:04.924 --> 42:06.090
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what is all this?

42:06.125 --> 42:07.091
I have prepared

42:07.126 --> 42:08.459
a variety of snack foods

42:08.494 --> 42:09.960
all beginning
with the letter "F"

42:09.996 --> 42:11.495
that we can eat
while watching

42:11.531 --> 42:13.197
the Flyers game, plus...

42:13.232 --> 42:16.100
I read that a rally hat

42:16.135 --> 42:19.303
can be effective
in reversing a curse.

42:19.338 --> 42:20.771
All right, so you admit
that you're a jinx?

42:20.807 --> 42:22.306
No, there's no such
thing as a jinx,

42:22.341 --> 42:23.808
but I do want you
to be happy, Booth.

42:23.843 --> 42:25.075
Oh, I'm happy.

42:25.111 --> 42:26.551
Booth, if you want
the Flyers to win,

42:26.579 --> 42:28.479
you should reverse
your shirt as well,

42:28.514 --> 42:29.546
and also your pants.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.763
You want me to
take my pants off?

42:30.787 --> 42:31.816
Yes.

42:31.818 --> 42:33.851
That's what you want me to do?
Okay, that's sexist.

42:33.886 --> 42:36.520
Now you're looking at me like
I'm some kind of piece of meat.

42:36.556 --> 42:37.855
I would never
look at you like that.

42:37.890 --> 42:39.290
I'm a vegetarian.

42:39.325 --> 42:40.925
Well, it's okay,
don't worry about it.

42:40.960 --> 42:42.840
I tell you what,
how about a kiss for good luck?

42:44.130 --> 42:45.429
I didn't know kisses
were good luck.

42:45.464 --> 42:46.630
Of course,
they're good luck.

42:46.666 --> 42:47.965
Well, The Flyers
are going to win.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.800
All right, okay,
don't get too overconfident,

42:49.836 --> 42:50.801
then you're gonna jinx them.

42:50.837 --> 42:52.303
Just pass the fries.

42:52.338 --> 42:53.374
No, you should really try
a falafel, Booth.

42:53.398 --> 42:54.005
No.

42:54.006 --> 42:55.105
Come on, the puck's
about to drop.

42:55.141 --> 42:56.473
Here we go!
Try a falafel, Booth.

42:56.509 --> 42:57.875
That's all-- I'll pass.
What about a fajita?

42:57.910 --> 42:59.176
No fajita.
Veggie fajita.

42:59.212 --> 43:00.644
I tell you what,
just say, "Go, Flyers."

43:00.680 --> 43:02.079
I'm gonna put a little--
no, no, I'm not gonna say that.

43:02.114 --> 43:03.147
If you don't say, "Go, Flyers--"
Booth.

43:03.182 --> 43:04.942
All right, look,
their midgame is about to...

43:08.255 --> 43:14.755

<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

43:39.596 --> 43:40.961
What's that mean?
