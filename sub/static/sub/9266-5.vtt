[police sirens]

00:03.546 --> 00:05.313
- We are at
a crossroads right now.

00:05.348 --> 00:08.150
You are gonna cut
the tough guy crap.

00:08.183 --> 00:10.719
- My mother never took me
shopping for a pageant gown,

00:10.753 --> 00:12.053
And because of that

00:12.088 --> 00:14.456
I never placed at miss texas.

00:14.490 --> 00:15.657
- [chuckles]

00:16.091 --> 00:19.294
- Mrs. Saracen?
- [sobbing]

00:19.328 --> 00:21.963
- It's your dad.

00:21.997 --> 00:23.565
He was killed.

00:23.599 --> 00:26.835
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

00:29.104 --> 00:31.773
- It's late in the game
here at east dillon, folks.

00:31.807 --> 00:34.642
And once again, the lions
are going gently

00:34.677 --> 00:36.144
Into that good night.
- You understand me?

00:36.178 --> 00:37.946
All right, let's get some points
out of this thing.

00:37.980 --> 00:39.647
- Hey, water! Let's go!

00:39.682 --> 00:41.082
- Down 24,

00:41.116 --> 00:42.851
Another short gain
for east dillon.

00:42.885 --> 00:44.586
- They know what we're
gonna do before we do it.

00:44.620 --> 00:45.820
- What do you want me to do?

00:45.855 --> 00:47.822
- Let's run wildcat.

00:47.857 --> 00:49.357
- No, no, no.
Coach said we ain't ready.

00:49.391 --> 00:50.959
- I'm ready, all right?

00:50.993 --> 00:52.694
Let's go out there and get
some of our pride back,

00:52.728 --> 00:54.362
Some dignity.

00:54.396 --> 00:56.097
- All right, he's gonna kick
our asses all over the state.

00:56.131 --> 00:58.433
I hope you know that.
- Yeah, coach can't catch me.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.501
- Hey!

01:04.039 --> 01:05.306
- All right, guys,
we're gonna go with right--

01:05.340 --> 01:06.875
- Nah, nah, nah,
new play, new play.

01:06.909 --> 01:08.977
All right, we're gonna go with
spread texas "a," skinny max.

01:09.011 --> 01:10.178
- That's not what coach said.

01:10.212 --> 01:11.746
- Shut up. You get your ass
out to "x"

01:11.780 --> 01:12.981
And make some blocks,
all right?

01:13.015 --> 01:14.549
Listen, we're going
option right, all right?

01:14.583 --> 01:16.551
On one, on one.

01:20.422 --> 01:22.190

01:22.224 --> 01:24.659
Coach taylor's come out
in a texas spread, ace set.

01:24.693 --> 01:26.394
Cafferty to the outside.

01:26.428 --> 01:27.528
- What are you doing?

01:27.563 --> 01:28.663
- Here we go.
This could be fun, folks.

01:28.697 --> 01:30.131
- It's cafferty
on the counter.

01:30.165 --> 01:31.699
He cuts inside.

01:31.734 --> 01:35.837
Oh, wait a second, folks!
It's a pitch to vince howard.

01:35.871 --> 01:38.373
Oh, and he smokes the safety!

01:38.407 --> 01:41.075
One man to beat.
Oh, my! What a move!

01:41.110 --> 01:42.710
Howard taking it to the barn,

The free safety.

01:57.626 --> 01:59.260
- Good call, coach!

01:59.295 --> 02:02.463
- 54 yards--the best run
from scrimmage all season,

02:02.498 --> 02:05.566
And a hell of a read
from luke cafferty.

02:08.770 --> 02:09.904
- Come here!

02:09.939 --> 02:11.105
Come here!
Who called that?

02:11.140 --> 02:12.774
Who called that play?
- It happened so fast.

02:12.808 --> 02:15.043
- Who called the play?
- I blacked out, coach.

Cafferty, who called the play?

02:16.946 --> 02:19.213
- I don't know
who called the play.

02:19.248 --> 02:20.715
- Who called the play?

02:20.749 --> 02:23.051

Get out there. Let's go!

some more of that?

02:29.658 --> 02:32.360
- Yeah.

02:32.394 --> 02:35.863

Vince howard coming off the edge

02:49.745 --> 02:51.879
Oh, and he strips him

Ball's on the court,

02:58.821 --> 03:01.155

But a monster game

A little light for a team

Some of you know him

04:37.486 --> 04:39.954
A few of you have played
with him before.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.957
You might have heard that
his father passed away.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.927
The funeral's gonna be
in a couple days.

04:45.961 --> 04:47.929
Thought it'd be nice
if maybe we say a word for him

04:47.963 --> 04:49.764
And his family.

04:49.798 --> 04:51.099
Lands.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.968

05:40.149 --> 05:41.816
How was the game?

05:41.850 --> 05:43.885
- Uh, it was good.

05:43.919 --> 05:46.387
Twinkle toes over here
kicked two points.

05:46.421 --> 05:48.156
- Twinkle toes?
- Twinkle toes.

05:48.190 --> 05:49.323
- That is not my nickname.

05:49.358 --> 05:50.558
- I think it should be.

05:50.592 --> 05:52.093
- It's golden foot.

I think I like

06:13.515 --> 06:15.883
Hopefully,
by now you got it.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.852
This hat looks dumb.

06:17.886 --> 06:21.489

10:50.258 --> 10:51.792
- So you just have
to know, matt,

10:51.827 --> 10:53.327
That what your dad did--

10:53.361 --> 10:55.062
What your daddy did
was important.

10:55.096 --> 10:58.132
I mean, right now I know
it seems real far away,

10:58.166 --> 11:00.768
But we're over there
for a reason.

11:00.802 --> 11:02.837
And your daddy knew that.
- [sobbing]

11:02.871 --> 11:04.472
- He was a hero.

11:04.506 --> 11:06.273
And that will
give you strength.

11:06.308 --> 11:08.275
- Thank you, mr. Garrity.
- Remember that.

11:08.310 --> 11:09.577
- I will.
- Excuse me.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.985
- Matty, you haven't moved
from that chair in an hour.

11:18.019 --> 11:21.021
- I don't really need to.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.823
Everybody just keeps
coming up to me.

11:22.858 --> 11:25.493
All I gotta do
is say thank you.

11:25.527 --> 11:26.961
And grandma's over there.

11:30.765 --> 11:32.800
He stepped on an I.E.D.

11:35.203 --> 11:39.173
How long do these things
go for?

11:39.207 --> 11:40.508
- You know what?
Screw you, bull.

11:40.542 --> 11:43.811
The pageant goes
for another two days.

11:43.845 --> 11:46.080
You know what,
you can still get here.

11:46.114 --> 11:48.082
I don't care!

11:48.116 --> 11:50.284
I really don't care
if you're hauling pieces

11:50.318 --> 11:52.553
Of jesus' cross
back to bethlehem.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.388
You promised her
you were gonna be here,

11:54.422 --> 11:55.756
And you are gonna be here.

11:55.790 --> 11:57.057
This is so damn
typical of you, you--

11:57.092 --> 11:58.526
- Please.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.160
- Do you have any idea what
you're doing to this girl?

12:00.195 --> 12:01.829
Any idea?

12:01.863 --> 12:03.330
She was so disappointed today.

12:03.365 --> 12:05.399
She sang her heart out for you,
and you didn't hear anything.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.535
[phone rings]

12:07.569 --> 12:08.903
- Hello.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.437
- That new place that
just opened up by smitty's.

12:10.472 --> 12:12.006
- Excuse me, boys.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.240
Excuse me.

12:13.275 --> 12:14.875
It's the telephone
for you, tim.

12:14.910 --> 12:16.610
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:16.645 --> 12:17.912
- Why are you
getting a phone call?

12:17.946 --> 12:20.047
- I don't know.

12:20.081 --> 12:21.315
Hello.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.551
- Hey, tim.

12:23.585 --> 12:24.952
- Becky?

12:24.986 --> 12:27.187
- Well, I know.
I just--I tried your cell,

12:27.222 --> 12:28.989
And I tried you at work,
so I figured you must

12:29.024 --> 12:30.257
Be at matt saracen's.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.092
- What are you doing right now?
I'm at a wake.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.327
Do you know
what a wake is?

12:33.361 --> 12:34.962
- Yeah, I just--

12:34.996 --> 12:36.830
I figured that you weren't
close to the dead guy,

12:36.865 --> 12:38.933
But if you are, I'm sorry.
I'll hang up now.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.801
- What's the problem?

12:40.835 --> 12:42.836
What is it, the trailer's
on fire or what?

12:42.871 --> 12:46.206
- No, I just--

12:46.241 --> 12:49.677
I just wanted
to tell you that, um,

12:49.711 --> 12:52.246
Thanks for coming today.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.181
It meant a lot to me.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.588
- [sigh]
you're welcome.

13:00.622 --> 13:03.057
You did good,
and good luck.

13:03.091 --> 13:07.161
You'll probably win,
so don't blow it.

13:07.195 --> 13:08.896
- You really think so?

13:08.930 --> 13:11.865
- All right, I gotta go.

13:11.900 --> 13:14.568
- Oh, yeah.
Thanks, bye.

13:14.603 --> 13:15.970
- I'll see you around.

13:30.619 --> 13:32.920
- Wait, so your job

13:32.954 --> 13:34.989
Is, like, to see the bodies
home or something?

13:35.023 --> 13:37.091
- I'm a recruiter,
mostly here in west texas.

13:37.125 --> 13:39.093
But this is an honor job.

13:39.127 --> 13:41.061
- So you didn't
even know my dad?

13:41.096 --> 13:42.663
- No.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.565
But I do my best to find out
about every man.

13:44.599 --> 13:48.936
Heard he was quite the joker
in his unit.

13:48.970 --> 13:50.638
A funny guy.

13:50.672 --> 13:52.072
- My dad?

13:52.107 --> 13:53.607
- Yeah.

13:53.642 --> 13:55.609
He always kept up morale.

13:55.644 --> 13:57.978
Did practical jokes and such.

13:58.013 --> 13:59.313
It's important, matt.

13:59.347 --> 14:00.681
- Yeah, no, I'm sure it is,

14:00.715 --> 14:02.516
But I'm also sure
that wasn't my dad.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.985
I bet he was
a really good soldier

14:05.020 --> 14:06.620
And all that,
but he wasn't a funny guy.

14:06.655 --> 14:08.255
He was not funny ever.

14:08.289 --> 14:09.757
So maybe you talked
to the wrong people.

14:09.791 --> 14:11.025
Maybe it was another guy
who was the joker,

14:11.059 --> 14:12.292
But my dad was not,
all right?

14:12.327 --> 14:13.794
I've never even seen him
smile in his life.

14:13.828 --> 14:15.162
So I can't--
- excuse me, matt.

14:15.196 --> 14:16.397
I think someone's--
someone's asking for you.

14:16.431 --> 14:17.798
- Yeah, it was good
talking to you.

14:17.832 --> 14:20.100
- Yeah, you too.
Thank you for coming.

14:20.135 --> 14:21.602
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

14:21.636 --> 14:23.404
And I don't even understand
why they send this guy.

14:23.438 --> 14:25.239
He's never even seen my dad
before in his life.

14:25.273 --> 14:27.074
We all know that he was not
a very funny--

14:27.108 --> 14:28.409
- I know, I know.

14:28.443 --> 14:31.345
That's why the riggins clan
and myself,

14:31.379 --> 14:34.314
We're gonna take you
out of here tomorrow night,

14:34.349 --> 14:37.518
Away from all the death
and the dying

14:37.552 --> 14:39.019
And the deviled eggs.

14:39.054 --> 14:40.621
- Yeah, fine.
Whatever, fine.

14:40.655 --> 14:42.589
I just don't want...
[knock on door]

14:42.624 --> 14:44.324
Someone talking about
my dad anymore.

14:44.359 --> 14:45.826
- Okay.
- Hello.

14:45.860 --> 14:49.229
- Hey, matt.
- Our condolences.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.298
On behalf of the boosters--
- are you serious?

14:51.332 --> 14:53.067
- Excuse me?

14:53.101 --> 14:54.401
On behalf of the boosters

14:54.436 --> 14:55.669
And the entire
panther organization,

14:55.704 --> 14:57.204
We just--

15:00.675 --> 15:03.410
- Ah.

15:10.085 --> 15:11.652
[horn honks]

15:14.155 --> 15:15.789
- 'sup cafferty?

15:15.824 --> 15:18.459
- I'm running, man.

15:18.493 --> 15:20.694
- I think he's--
you know, I think he's mad

15:20.729 --> 15:22.830
That I'm co-conference
player of the week.

15:22.864 --> 15:24.231
- Yeah, that's what
I'm pissed about.

15:24.265 --> 15:26.133
- See this right here?
Look, hey, luke.

15:26.167 --> 15:27.634
That's me.
That's j.D. Mccoy right there.

15:27.669 --> 15:29.970
But I'm sharing this
with this guy.

15:30.004 --> 15:31.472
I don't know who this guy is.
What's his name, vince howard?

15:31.506 --> 15:32.840
Do you know a guy
by that name?

15:32.874 --> 15:34.341
- Yeah, come to think of it,
I do recall spending

15:34.375 --> 15:36.376
A couple hours in jail
with someone by that name.

15:36.411 --> 15:37.678
I don't know how I got there,

15:37.712 --> 15:40.247
Considering my friends
were with me at the time,

15:40.281 --> 15:42.349
Kevin and--what did you say
your name was, j.D. Mcdick?

15:42.383 --> 15:44.151
- Oh, come on, man.
Look, the cops were there, okay?

15:44.185 --> 15:45.385
We took off.
I'm sorry.

15:45.420 --> 15:46.520
- You're a jackass, dude.

15:46.554 --> 15:47.855
- Look, what do you
want me to do?

15:47.889 --> 15:49.089
You want me to get out
and get on my hands and knees,

15:49.124 --> 15:50.691
Is that what you want me to do?
I'll do it.

15:50.725 --> 15:52.359
- Look, man.
Buddy, we're both sorry.

15:52.393 --> 15:54.394
All right, but we're going
paintballing tomorrow night.

15:54.429 --> 15:55.829
We want you to come.

15:55.864 --> 15:57.197
It'll be fun, man.
Come on, please.

15:57.232 --> 15:58.732
- I'll think about it.
- Think about it.

15:58.767 --> 16:00.267
- All right, but hey, luke,
right here, man.

16:00.301 --> 16:01.435
Give it to me.

16:01.469 --> 16:03.003
- Luke, we'll see you
around, man.

16:03.037 --> 16:05.172
We're sorry.
Later, bud.

16:08.610 --> 16:09.743
- Julie will sit here
with you.

16:09.778 --> 16:13.280
- Good idea.
- Thank you, julie.

16:13.314 --> 16:14.782
- You don't think
she'll get hot in there?

16:14.816 --> 16:15.949
- No, she'll be fine.

16:15.984 --> 16:17.151
Julie's with her.
She'll be okay.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.418
Don't you worry, okay,
hon?

16:18.453 --> 16:19.720
- Uh-huh.

16:19.754 --> 16:21.889
- What you've got here
is what we like to call

16:21.923 --> 16:24.291
Our american hero
memorial package.

16:24.325 --> 16:26.160
Now, this comes
with your choice

16:26.194 --> 16:28.729
Of a mahogany
or cherry wood casket.

16:28.763 --> 16:30.531
The standard outer
burial container.

16:30.565 --> 16:32.900
- What--
what's that?

16:32.934 --> 16:35.869
- Well, over time,
the caskets themselves

16:35.904 --> 16:38.338
Deteriorate in the soil,
the moisture.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.606
- Oh.

16:39.641 --> 16:41.608
- And since veteran affairs
will be picking up

16:41.643 --> 16:43.744
Most of the bill,
you can honor your father

16:43.778 --> 16:46.079
In a manner he deserves.

16:46.114 --> 16:47.381
- Right, thanks.

16:47.415 --> 16:49.249
- So there's the embalming.

16:49.284 --> 16:53.453
- Is--is my dad here?

16:53.488 --> 16:55.923
- Oh, he's being prepared
right now.

16:55.957 --> 16:57.991
- Do I see him?

16:58.026 --> 17:00.961
- I think, in this case,

17:00.995 --> 17:03.297
A closed casket
is most appropriate.

17:03.331 --> 17:05.632
- Right, right.

17:05.666 --> 17:06.967
- Okay. So--

17:07.001 --> 17:08.167
- Actually, if that's
the case,

17:08.203 --> 17:09.403
Can I just ask
one quick question?

17:09.436 --> 17:10.704
Sorry to interrupt.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.906
This viewing/visitation day,

17:12.941 --> 17:15.008
Use of facilities,
use of staff, day prior.

17:15.042 --> 17:17.477
That wouldn't be necessary
if it's a closed casket,

17:17.512 --> 17:18.779
Is that right?
- Of course.

17:18.813 --> 17:20.781
- Okay, so we can
get rid of those charges.

17:20.815 --> 17:22.583
That would be great.
Thank you.

17:22.617 --> 17:25.618
- Now see,
the rest is laid out.

17:25.653 --> 17:27.788
This is for
the funeral service escort.

17:27.821 --> 17:29.223
- I don't understand
that either.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.825
The funeral service escort,
what does that mean exactly?

17:31.860 --> 17:33.160
- Well, those are the cars
that will--

17:33.194 --> 17:34.461
You know, for the family,
friends.

17:34.495 --> 17:36.530
- Well, they have cars.
I mean, we all have cars.

17:36.564 --> 17:38.832
- Yeah, and, um--

17:38.867 --> 17:40.634
And my grandma's
in the car right now.

17:40.668 --> 17:43.170
So can we just decide
whatever this is and--

17:43.204 --> 17:44.738
- You know, why don't you--
you go on out there.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.073
I can finish up with him.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.574
I think we're just about
at the end of it anyway.

17:47.609 --> 17:48.976
You go on out.
- You sure?

17:49.010 --> 17:50.510
- Yeah, I think so.
I think so.

17:50.545 --> 17:52.145
All right,
I think this is just--

17:52.180 --> 17:53.447
- Thank you.

17:53.481 --> 17:54.648
- You have any questions,
call me.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.016
- Yes, sir.

17:56.050 --> 17:57.818
Thank you.
- I'll be right there.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.521
I need to ask you
a quick question.

18:01.556 --> 18:03.490
With all due respect,
does that boy look like

18:03.524 --> 18:05.592
He can pay $9,000
to bury his father?

18:05.627 --> 18:07.794
- Well, veterans affairs
will be picking up--

18:07.829 --> 18:09.563
- You look me in the eye,
you tell me veterans affairs

18:09.597 --> 18:12.266
Is gonna pick up
a $9,000 bill.

18:14.035 --> 18:16.103
- No, not the entire $9,000.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.204
- Mm-hmm.

18:17.238 --> 18:18.672
- But they do pick up
a large portion.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.340
- Okay, well, I think--
we need to start over

18:20.375 --> 18:21.508
From the beginning, okay?

18:21.542 --> 18:22.910
And let's do this quickly,
please.

18:22.944 --> 18:24.478
Do you have another listing
you can give me?

18:24.512 --> 18:26.313
- Keep your hands
to yourself, man.

18:26.347 --> 18:28.215
We're looking
for old cars like this.

18:28.249 --> 18:30.017
- What is this, man?

18:30.051 --> 18:31.451
- Old models, man,
all right?

18:31.486 --> 18:32.719
You see when they stop
making the cars,

18:32.754 --> 18:33.921
They stop making the parts.

18:33.955 --> 18:35.722
It makes the parts worth more,
you feel me?

18:35.757 --> 18:37.324
- Like a bunch of junk parts in
here, man.

18:37.358 --> 18:38.825
- You see a new car,

18:38.860 --> 18:40.761
Think it's sharp,
think it's fly,

18:40.795 --> 18:41.828
You need to walk away.

18:41.863 --> 18:43.664
- Walk away? Why?

18:43.698 --> 18:46.266
- Oh, it's 'cause they got
that lojack, man.

18:46.301 --> 18:47.634
- Man, we're in west texas.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.136
Ain't nobody
got no lojack.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.138
You walk away
'cause half them new cars

18:51.172 --> 18:52.306
Got them steering locks.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.974
Lojack.
Man, what's wrong with you?

18:54.008 --> 18:55.809
- I told him his braids
too tight sometimes.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.511
He don't listen.
- Hey, man, watch out.

18:57.545 --> 18:59.212
- Watch out, what?
Watch out.

18:59.247 --> 19:01.014
- Yo, yo, both of you
need to shut up.

19:01.049 --> 19:02.416
This here is school,

19:02.450 --> 19:04.184
And the more you talk,
the more you miss.

19:04.218 --> 19:05.686
The more you miss, the more
likely your bitch asses

19:05.720 --> 19:07.287
Are gonna
do something stupid.

19:07.322 --> 19:11.224
All right, this place where
you put the keys in,

19:11.259 --> 19:12.726
It's called a tumbler.

19:12.760 --> 19:13.894
You stick your
screwdriver in it,

19:13.928 --> 19:15.162
Jiggle it a little bit.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.897
Sometimes the dashboard
might come on.

19:16.931 --> 19:18.799
Sometimes the engine.
Yo, don't panic.

19:18.833 --> 19:22.803
Be cool and get paid.

19:22.837 --> 19:24.972
[engine starts]

19:25.006 --> 19:26.340
Most of the times,
this ain't an option.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.275
Then you gotta
hot box the bitch.

19:28.309 --> 19:31.011
Come in closer.
This is the magic.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.512
- Honey, we're gonna leave
in just a minute.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.548
- Yeah, all right.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.821
Hey.

19:40.855 --> 19:44.124
- Hi.

19:44.158 --> 19:46.360
That was really nice
of your mom.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.762
I appreciate it.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.697
- She's good in crisis.

19:50.732 --> 19:53.767
She's pretty much
built for crisis.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.802
- Yeah.

19:59.007 --> 20:02.109
- She's invited you over
for dinner tonight

20:02.143 --> 20:03.343
If you want to come.

20:03.378 --> 20:05.345
I said you probably
had family stuff to do,

20:05.380 --> 20:08.582
But if you want to get away
for an hour or something,

20:08.616 --> 20:10.917
I'd love to see you.

20:10.952 --> 20:13.053
- Wkay.

20:13.087 --> 20:16.089
- Okay, you'll come or...?

20:18.259 --> 20:20.660
- Um...

20:20.695 --> 20:21.962
Yeah, okay, I'll--

20:21.996 --> 20:23.997
Okay, I'll come.

20:26.734 --> 20:28.969
- Are you all right?

20:29.003 --> 20:32.906
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I just--

20:32.940 --> 20:34.875
You know,
this stuff happens.

20:34.909 --> 20:37.277
Right now
it's happening to me.

20:37.311 --> 20:39.079
Someday it's gonna
happen to you.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.114
And--

20:43.384 --> 20:46.319
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

20:46.354 --> 20:48.855
That was a stupid thing
to say.

20:53.194 --> 20:56.029
- It's okay.

20:56.064 --> 20:59.299
- So what time
is this dinner?

21:02.270 --> 21:05.872
- Koala bears--
you know what they eat?

21:05.907 --> 21:07.674
Do you know
what koala bears eat?

21:07.708 --> 21:10.744
- And that's more than enough
for a first down.

21:10.778 --> 21:12.913
That makes it six carries
for 38 yards.

21:12.947 --> 21:15.348
I'm not saying
this young man's ready to start,

21:15.383 --> 21:16.850
But brian "smash" williams

21:16.884 --> 21:18.185
Is making the most
of this blowout.

21:18.219 --> 21:20.053
- Look at him run, huh?
Look at him go.

21:20.088 --> 21:21.354
- Hey.
- How 'bout that?

21:21.389 --> 21:24.224
- Look at y'all.
- Mmm.

21:24.258 --> 21:26.426
- Hi, sweet girl.

21:26.461 --> 21:27.594
Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?

21:27.628 --> 21:28.762
- Did y'all have fun?

21:28.796 --> 21:30.430
- It's almost time
for a nap for you.

21:30.465 --> 21:31.798
- Mm-hmm.
- How'd it go?

21:31.833 --> 21:34.835
- It went.
Somebody ready for a nap?

21:34.869 --> 21:36.236
- "no, no."

21:36.270 --> 21:39.272
- Maybe we'll both
lie down together for a nap.

21:39.307 --> 21:40.907
- [whispering] here, here, here,
here, here.

21:40.942 --> 21:44.478
Take that with you.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.513
- All right.

21:55.223 --> 21:56.656
- How's he holding up?

21:56.691 --> 21:58.692
- Um...

22:02.663 --> 22:04.798
He's trying.

22:06.801 --> 22:08.802
- Oh.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.792
I'm not going anywhere.

22:43.638 --> 22:44.604
- Who's your favorite
football player?

22:44.639 --> 22:45.605
- You ever heard
of johnny unitas?

22:45.640 --> 22:46.606
- Mm-hmm.

22:46.641 --> 22:48.041
- My old coach over there

22:48.075 --> 22:49.276
Used to tell me
about johnny unitas.

22:49.310 --> 22:51.278
Said I remind him a lot
of johnny unitas.

22:51.312 --> 22:52.412
See that old man
over there in the back,

22:52.446 --> 22:54.147
One of the oldest guys
in this room?

22:54.182 --> 22:55.382
[laughter]

22:55.416 --> 22:56.850
That's my dad.

22:56.884 --> 22:58.718
He taught me
everything I know.

22:58.753 --> 22:59.953
You gotta be fast.

22:59.987 --> 23:01.288
You gotta know
what plays you're calling.

23:01.322 --> 23:02.656
You gotta look around.
You gotta see everything moving.

23:02.690 --> 23:03.957
When I step to the line,

23:03.991 --> 23:05.759
I see everything happening
way before it happens.

23:05.793 --> 23:08.195
I'm a good one or two seconds
ahead of the coverage.

23:08.229 --> 23:10.263
- The boy scout's
pretty arrogant.

23:10.298 --> 23:12.532
- You guys are all the team,
okay?

23:12.567 --> 23:13.867
- He's got a hell of an arm.

23:13.901 --> 23:16.269
- All right, be a hero,
win championships.

23:16.304 --> 23:18.805
I see it in you.
All right?

23:18.839 --> 23:21.408
[applause]

23:21.442 --> 23:23.076
- Thank you, j.D.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.945
<i>Now for our other
dillon gazette</i>

23:24.979 --> 23:26.880

of the week,

23:26.914 --> 23:28.882
Vince howard
of the east dillon lions.

23:28.916 --> 23:30.917
[applause]

23:33.521 --> 23:35.822
Now some of you kids here,
this is your first year

23:35.856 --> 23:37.224
Playing pop warner,
but guess what.

23:37.258 --> 23:39.960
This is vince's
first year too.

23:39.994 --> 23:41.795
So pay attention,
all right?

23:41.829 --> 23:43.096
You've got a role model here.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.464
What do you say, vince?

23:44.498 --> 23:46.299
You got some words
for these players here?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.574
- What am I supposed to say?

23:54.609 --> 23:56.476
- Just talk about the game.

23:56.510 --> 23:58.178
Just tell 'em about it.

24:05.653 --> 24:08.388
- Don't panic,
all right?

24:08.422 --> 24:11.691
Stay cool,
and you'll get paid.

24:11.726 --> 24:13.493
- Yeah!

24:13.527 --> 24:15.829
[applause]

24:28.509 --> 24:29.976
- Stop.
- Hold on, one--

24:30.011 --> 24:31.945
- Seriously, get away from me.
- Two, say it.

24:31.979 --> 24:33.380
- No regrets.
- No regret.

24:39.153 --> 24:40.320
- Ahh!

24:40.354 --> 24:41.855
That feels good.

24:41.889 --> 24:43.323
- That was really close.

24:43.357 --> 24:44.724
- Hey, you guys remember
the state finals game

24:44.759 --> 24:46.593
Three years ago?
- Uh-uh.

24:46.627 --> 24:47.894
- No, billy.
- What game?

24:47.928 --> 24:50.163
- Who played in it?
- Stop messing with me, man.

24:50.197 --> 24:53.033
- Are you really reminiscing
about three years ago?

24:53.067 --> 24:54.067
- You guys remember,
there was, like,

24:54.101 --> 24:55.068
Ten seconds
left on the clock.

24:55.102 --> 24:56.703
We had matt "mayday" saracen

24:56.737 --> 24:59.673
Sitting back there
behind the center.

24:59.707 --> 25:01.508
- Never has he been called
"mayday."

25:01.542 --> 25:03.543
- Well, we need to come up
with a nickname.

25:03.577 --> 25:05.378
I like "cobra."
it's got a good sound to it.

25:05.413 --> 25:06.813
Hey, cobra, think fast.

25:06.847 --> 25:08.348
You're cobra.

25:08.382 --> 25:09.582
- Dude.

25:09.617 --> 25:12.018
- Why would you kill
cobra's beer?

25:12.053 --> 25:13.219
- I know.
Hey, let's see your hands.

25:13.254 --> 25:14.521
- You guys know
I have to give a eulogy

25:14.555 --> 25:16.489
At this thing tomorrow?

25:16.524 --> 25:20.760
I got to get up there
in front of everybody

25:20.795 --> 25:25.165
And say good stuff
about this man.

25:26.801 --> 25:29.269
And all I really
want to say is,

25:29.303 --> 25:31.871
"here lies henry saracen.

25:31.906 --> 25:34.507
"his mother annoyed him.

call you out on it.

26:13.247 --> 26:14.547
And you know what
the worst part is?

26:14.582 --> 26:15.982
Even if I did get up there
and say that,

26:16.016 --> 26:18.451
Even if I finally did, like,
say all that to him,

26:18.486 --> 26:20.186
I don't even know
if I'd be saying it to him

26:20.221 --> 26:22.555
Because I don't even know
if he's in that damn box.

26:22.590 --> 26:24.257
It's a closed casket.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.259
For all I know,
it's someone else.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.528
It's someone funnier.

Or a bunch of rocks.

26:35.136 --> 26:37.137

26:37.171 --> 26:40.240

to find out then.

26:42.243 --> 26:45.812
Right?

26:45.846 --> 26:47.347
Cobra, you got the key.

26:47.381 --> 26:48.848
- There's no key.

26:48.883 --> 26:50.717
- Break the window.
- There's probably a door--

26:50.751 --> 26:51.951
- Just break it.
- It's stuck.

26:51.986 --> 26:53.286

to be doing--

26:56.390 --> 26:58.591
- You're wasted.
- Where is he?

26:58.626 --> 27:00.059
Where is he?

27:00.094 --> 27:02.562

I saw him before.

- hey, hold on.

27:12.540 --> 27:15.308
- My friend wants to see
his old man.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.544
- I want to see my dad.

27:17.578 --> 27:19.879
- Um, well, I thought
we agreed earlier

27:19.914 --> 27:21.881
That that probably
wasn't a very good idea.

27:21.916 --> 27:23.817
- Look, buddy,
he wants to see his dad.

I want to see my dad. Now.

27:57.017 --> 28:00.353
That's him?
- Yeah.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.856
Son, I really don't think
this is a very good idea.

28:02.890 --> 28:05.291

28:05.326 --> 28:07.827
But please just open it.
- Okay.

- We are going to the field.

We're just getting
a little practice in first.

on my truck, man, come on.

a piece of crap anyways.

29:09.056 --> 29:10.557
Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, it's a piece of crap

We all know this.

to pretend it's not

we get to hang out,

That means I get to be the one
that you all look down on?

29:40.087 --> 29:42.255
- We don't look down on you.
- [scoffs]

29:42.289 --> 29:44.257
- We look down on you
with you.

29:44.291 --> 29:45.592
- [laughs] that's right.
That was a good one.

29:45.626 --> 29:47.560
- All right, jokers.
All right, that's funny.

29:47.595 --> 29:49.095
- What?
Come on, luke.

29:49.129 --> 29:50.730
- Get out.
- Why you gotta do this?

29:50.764 --> 29:51.898
- Get out of the truck.

29:51.932 --> 29:53.299
- What's your problem
tonight, man?

29:53.334 --> 29:55.602
- What's my problem?
You're my problem, idiot.

29:55.636 --> 29:57.437
- What are you doing?
- Ah, god!

29:57.471 --> 29:58.805
- What are you doing, dude?

29:58.839 --> 30:00.573
- I'm not going paintballing
is what I'm doing.

30:00.608 --> 30:02.442
- You know what,
screw you, luke.

30:02.476 --> 30:04.944
How's it feel being second best
on the worst team in texas?

30:04.979 --> 30:06.245
- All right,
better watch it.

30:06.280 --> 30:10.149
Ah!

30:10.184 --> 30:11.918
- Come on, man.

30:11.952 --> 30:13.186
Luke, I'm sorry.

30:13.220 --> 30:14.487
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry too.

30:14.521 --> 30:15.555
You're done, dude.
You're done.

30:15.589 --> 30:16.956
- Come on, luke.

30:16.991 --> 30:20.360
- Get off my truck!
Get off my truck.

30:21.428 --> 30:22.629
- Screw you, luke!

30:22.663 --> 30:24.931
[firing]

30:44.251 --> 30:46.185
- Hey.

30:49.757 --> 30:51.758
- Hey.

31:00.401 --> 31:03.136
How'd it go?

31:03.170 --> 31:05.304
- Second runner-up.

31:08.676 --> 31:12.011
- That's, um--
that's third, right?

31:12.046 --> 31:13.179
- Yeah.

31:13.213 --> 31:16.015
- Then I guess
it's not really--

31:16.050 --> 31:17.884
- Third place sucks.
- Yeah, it's crap.

31:20.320 --> 31:25.158
Yep.

31:25.192 --> 31:27.627
- So how was your day?

31:29.763 --> 31:32.165
- Weird.

31:32.199 --> 31:34.267
- Weird how?

31:37.171 --> 31:40.373
- I saw something that, uh--

31:43.444 --> 31:46.746
Or rather I saw someone
see something that...

31:51.719 --> 31:55.521
You ever just feel
completely useless?

31:55.556 --> 31:58.558
- You're not useless.

31:58.592 --> 32:01.260
- Right.

32:02.930 --> 32:07.166
- Close your eyes.

32:07.201 --> 32:08.901
Just do it.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.484
- [clears throat]

32:25.753 --> 32:28.287
No.

32:28.322 --> 32:30.990
This--

32:31.024 --> 32:32.425
This can't happen.

32:32.459 --> 32:35.261
I can't do this.

32:38.432 --> 32:39.766
Good night.

32:44.438 --> 32:52.345
âª âª

32:52.379 --> 32:53.446
- Hi.

32:53.480 --> 32:54.747
- You got I.D.?

32:54.782 --> 32:56.516
- Oh, it's for my mama.

32:56.550 --> 32:57.917
She ain't feeling too good.

32:57.951 --> 32:59.552
- I need to see I.D.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.120
- Okay, you know what,
I walked all--

33:01.155 --> 33:03.256
- Hey bud,
you're almost out of soap.

33:03.290 --> 33:06.092
Hey.
Becky, right?

33:06.126 --> 33:07.260
- Yeah.

33:07.294 --> 33:09.061
- There you go.

33:09.096 --> 33:10.363
- That doesn't look good.

33:10.397 --> 33:11.931
- Mm-mm.

33:11.965 --> 33:13.866
What do you think?

33:13.901 --> 33:15.902
- I think you ought
to buy something.

33:15.936 --> 33:20.039
- We're together.
This is my stuff.

33:20.073 --> 33:23.342
âª âª

33:23.377 --> 33:24.877
Here's my I.D.

33:26.613 --> 33:28.014
- Thanks.

33:28.048 --> 33:30.383
- Sure.

33:33.020 --> 33:35.521
- Well, thanks again.

33:35.556 --> 33:37.123
- Yeah, yeah.

33:37.157 --> 33:38.658
My name's luke.

33:38.692 --> 33:40.393
- I know who you are.

33:40.427 --> 33:41.861
- Oh.
Here you go.

33:41.895 --> 33:43.763
- Yeah.
See you later.

33:43.797 --> 33:47.633
- All right, night.

33:47.668 --> 33:49.335
Hey, you want to go
to a car wash?

33:49.369 --> 33:51.904
I got to go
to a car wash.

33:51.939 --> 33:54.173
Look at that thing.

33:57.644 --> 34:00.112
- Sure.
Why the hell not?

34:00.147 --> 34:02.548
- All right.
Why the hell not?

34:05.118 --> 34:06.152
[knocking at door]

34:06.186 --> 34:08.487
- You want to get that,
sweetie?

34:15.362 --> 34:16.529
- Hey.

34:16.563 --> 34:17.496
- Hey.

34:17.531 --> 34:19.599
- Sorry, um,

34:19.632 --> 34:22.935
I know I'm really late.

34:22.969 --> 34:25.771
- It's okay.

34:25.806 --> 34:28.206
We saved you a plate.

34:28.242 --> 34:29.976
- Thank you.
Thank you.

34:30.010 --> 34:31.643
Mrs. Taylor, I'm sorry.
I know that--

34:31.678 --> 34:33.913
- Oh, you're fine, honey.
We saved you a plate.

34:33.947 --> 34:35.614
We saved our dessert
for now.

34:35.649 --> 34:37.516
We'll have dessert with you.
You're fine.

34:37.551 --> 34:39.719
- Thank you.
- Come on, sit down.

34:39.753 --> 34:40.887
Don't you worry.
- You drive?

34:40.920 --> 34:42.722
- No, sir, no, no.

34:42.755 --> 34:44.489
I had a nice walk though.

34:51.565 --> 34:54.199
- Well?

34:56.168 --> 34:59.605
- You don't have to eat it
if you don't want to.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.741
- I'm hungry.

35:01.775 --> 35:04.043
- Well, do you want
something else, hon?

35:04.077 --> 35:06.245
You don't--
- no, it's--

35:06.280 --> 35:08.147
I'm sorry, mrs. Taylor,

35:08.181 --> 35:09.582
I don't like carrots.

35:09.616 --> 35:11.517
- Oh, well, then--

35:11.551 --> 35:14.687
- And I don't like when
they touch the meat so...

35:14.721 --> 35:16.188
- Well, I'll just
take it away then.

35:16.223 --> 35:17.957
- No, look, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.325
- No, no, no, no.
- No, it's fine.

35:19.359 --> 35:21.060
I'm being rude.
I'm sorry, I don't--

35:21.094 --> 35:22.495
- Honey, you're fine.

35:22.529 --> 35:24.864
- I don't like being rude.
I don't like being rude.

35:24.898 --> 35:26.098
- It's okay.

35:26.133 --> 35:28.401
- I'm just having
a moment here.

35:28.435 --> 35:31.003
I just--

35:31.038 --> 35:34.173
I'm just having a moment.
I don't think I'm okay.

35:34.207 --> 35:35.808
- Matt.

35:35.842 --> 35:37.810
- [sobbing]

35:41.448 --> 35:43.316
I hate him.

35:43.350 --> 35:46.152
And I don't--

35:46.186 --> 35:49.455
I don't like hating people.

35:49.489 --> 35:52.091
But I just put
all my hate on him

35:52.125 --> 35:54.927
So I don't have to hate
anybody else

35:54.962 --> 35:59.131
And so that I could be
a good person, you know,

35:59.166 --> 36:02.668
To my grandmother
and to my friends.

36:04.738 --> 36:06.973
To your daughter.

36:07.007 --> 36:08.341
That's all I want to say.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.876
I just want to tell him
to his face that I hate him.

36:13.413 --> 36:15.047
But he doesn't
even have a face.

36:16.583 --> 36:17.750
I'm sorry, mrs. Taylor.

36:17.784 --> 36:20.553
I'm--I'll see y'all
tomorrow.

36:20.587 --> 36:21.887
- Matt.

36:21.922 --> 36:23.122
Matt, you don't have to go.

36:23.156 --> 36:24.557
- It's all right.
- Matt!

36:24.591 --> 36:26.359
- Honey, honey.

36:26.393 --> 36:28.160
Come here, sweetie.
It's okay.

36:28.195 --> 36:29.495
- You're just gonna
let him go like that?

36:29.529 --> 36:30.963
- Shh.

36:30.998 --> 36:33.132
I'll get him.
I'll get him.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.967
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.

36:35.002 --> 36:36.669
Be all right.

36:36.703 --> 36:38.104
Be all right.

36:38.138 --> 36:39.972
- It's okay.

36:40.007 --> 36:41.974
- I have to do something.

36:42.009 --> 36:44.443
I can't just let him
hurt like that.

36:46.146 --> 36:47.747
- Matt.

36:47.781 --> 36:49.749
Matt!

37:14.107 --> 37:16.108
I'm gonna walk you home.

37:19.713 --> 37:21.981
- Okay.

38:02.489 --> 38:04.123
- Looks good.
- It's pretty.

38:04.157 --> 38:05.458
- Thank you.

38:53.206 --> 38:55.207
- The picture.
Look at his picture.

38:55.242 --> 38:56.408
- Yeah.

38:56.443 --> 38:58.077
- Lead us not
into temptation,

38:58.111 --> 38:59.678
But deliver us
from evil.

38:59.713 --> 39:02.748
For thine is the kingdom
and the power

39:02.782 --> 39:04.683
And the glory forever
and ever.

39:04.718 --> 39:05.818
Amen.

39:05.852 --> 39:08.254
Now, matt would like to share

39:08.288 --> 39:11.290
Some words of remembrance
with us.

39:16.463 --> 39:20.199
- Um...

39:20.233 --> 39:24.303
I'm just gonna tell you
one story I remember,

39:24.337 --> 39:28.274
And that'll be it.

39:28.308 --> 39:31.477
We were at the...

39:31.511 --> 39:33.379
Supermarket.

39:33.413 --> 39:38.050
It was me and my mom,

39:38.084 --> 39:39.385
Grandma...

39:43.523 --> 39:44.924
And my dad--

39:44.958 --> 39:47.660
All four of us,
our whole family.

39:47.694 --> 39:49.228
My dad was pushing the cart,

39:49.262 --> 39:52.031
And he stopped to grab
some toilet paper

39:52.065 --> 39:54.133
And put it in the cart,
and my grandma said,

39:54.167 --> 39:55.701
"no, that's not
the right one.

39:55.735 --> 40:00.005
That's not the right toilet
paper that we use."

40:00.040 --> 40:01.540
She grabbed
the right toilet paper

40:01.575 --> 40:03.108
And put it in the cart

40:03.143 --> 40:06.812
And stormed off.

40:06.846 --> 40:09.715
And my dad just kinda
stared off at her.

40:09.749 --> 40:12.651
And then he just started
grabbing all the toilet paper

40:12.686 --> 40:15.554
Off the shelf
and putting it in the cart.

40:15.589 --> 40:17.223
I mean, he just
stacked it full of--

40:17.257 --> 40:18.891
And it wasn't spiteful
or nothing.

40:18.925 --> 40:20.392
He--

40:20.427 --> 40:22.494
I don't know,
maybe you had to be there,

40:22.529 --> 40:24.697
But as a six-year-old,

40:24.731 --> 40:27.333
It was the funniest thing
I'd ever seen in my life,

40:27.367 --> 40:29.335
And I just laughed about it
for weeks.

40:31.871 --> 40:34.807
I guess...

40:34.841 --> 40:39.478
My dad was just a funnier
person than he really let on.

40:39.512 --> 40:41.513
He was kinda private
in that way,

40:41.548 --> 40:45.351
And I don't really know y.

40:47.821 --> 40:49.455
But one thing
that he wasn't private about

40:49.489 --> 40:51.223
Was his service.

40:51.258 --> 40:53.859
He was in the army
for 20 years,

40:53.893 --> 40:56.228
And that was something
that he was--

40:56.263 --> 40:58.831
He was proud of.

40:58.865 --> 41:01.800
And he missed--

41:01.835 --> 41:03.736
He missed
some of my birthdays,

41:03.770 --> 41:05.904
And he missed

41:05.939 --> 41:10.409
A lot of me growing up.

41:10.443 --> 41:14.480
But I think the point
is that I got to grow up.

41:14.514 --> 41:16.582
And I got to have
those birthdays.

41:18.885 --> 41:20.686
You know,
he went and did a job

41:20.720 --> 41:25.357
That not many people
want to do.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.261
Because of that,
we all get to be here,

41:29.296 --> 41:30.429
And we get to grow up,

41:30.463 --> 41:32.631
And we get to have
our birthdays.

41:38.204 --> 41:40.506
And I think that's
something to be proud of.

41:43.376 --> 41:45.744
So thank you
for being here.

41:45.779 --> 41:48.247
And my family thanks you.

41:48.281 --> 41:56.522
âª âª

41:59.759 --> 42:01.860
- On behalf of the president
of the United States

42:01.895 --> 42:03.262
And our grateful nation,

42:03.296 --> 42:05.731
For the faithful service
rendered by your loved one.

42:05.765 --> 42:08.367
- Thank you.

42:08.401 --> 42:09.702
Thank you.

42:12.605 --> 42:16.075
- Fire.
[gunshot]

42:16.109 --> 42:18.243
Fire.
[gunshot]

42:18.278 --> 42:21.714
Fire.
[gunshot]

42:21.748 --> 42:23.749
- Y'all are invited now

42:23.783 --> 42:26.085
To the saracen house
for a reception.

42:26.119 --> 42:28.654
So we hope to see you there.
