00:20.756 --> 00:22.154
I knew it.

00:24.888 --> 00:26.888
Come on. Get.

00:30.759 --> 00:32.092
Don't you die on me.

00:32.426 --> 00:33.900
Don't you dare die.

00:38.095 --> 00:39.767
Yeah. Come on, come on!

00:44.194 --> 00:45.218
Thank you.

00:45.382 --> 00:48.022
Never seen anybody
shoot like that before.

00:48.358 --> 00:50.710
Wait. I know you.

00:50.970 --> 00:53.846
You're SMILF...
Single Mom...

00:53.929 --> 00:55.975
...Is Losing Faith.
That's right.

00:56.272 --> 00:58.257
Well, you restored mine.

00:58.387 --> 01:01.346
SMILF, if there is
any way I can repay you...

01:01.514 --> 01:04.304
Well, we can start with
that nice reward on your head.

01:08.137 --> 01:10.054
Hitch her up
to the buggy.

01:18.846 --> 01:21.444
Hi, SMILF.

01:48.554 --> 01:50.512
What the fuck, Bridge?

01:50.596 --> 01:51.804
Shit.

01:51.888 --> 01:53.304
Oh, hey.

01:53.390 --> 01:56.249
I left this asshole
to hang out in the sun.

01:56.624 --> 01:58.022
Oh, this is your guy?

01:58.228 --> 02:00.019
Shit. I didn't think
I was gonna see you.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.638
You didn't think
you were gonna see me?

02:01.721 --> 02:03.679
- Bridge, this is selfish.
- What do you mean?

02:03.763 --> 02:06.471
I just rode for five days
to find this guy.

02:06.554 --> 02:09.095
You know because I couldn't
pay my exorbitant land taxes,

02:09.179 --> 02:10.943
this asshole took my till

02:11.030 --> 02:13.139
and my mules for Mr. Daddy?

02:13.225 --> 02:15.944
- Sounds rough.
- He's a coward and a thief.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.194
And he should be out there
getting eaten alive

02:18.280 --> 02:20.093
by them damn buzzards
where I left him.

02:20.186 --> 02:22.444
He's also worth
a lot of money.

02:22.929 --> 02:24.638
And you call yourself
a cowboy.

02:24.721 --> 02:26.679
I am a cowboy.

02:30.835 --> 02:32.889
Nice to see Daisy's
doing better.

02:32.975 --> 02:34.171
Oh, yeah.

02:34.296 --> 02:35.858
You know, she's living
her best life.

02:35.944 --> 02:37.319
Oh, God.

02:37.405 --> 02:38.779
You might want
to go around back

02:38.993 --> 02:40.134
and get him off
that way.

02:40.220 --> 02:41.796
That's a good idea.

02:41.882 --> 02:46.632
I know it's a good idea.

02:47.012 --> 02:48.173
Ah. All right.

02:48.259 --> 02:50.118
I'll meet you
at the saloon later.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.054
All right.
See you later.

02:52.137 --> 02:54.179
Oh! Oh, God.

02:54.262 --> 02:55.596
I might need
your help with him.

02:55.679 --> 02:57.304
I ain't helping you

02:57.387 --> 02:58.471
with shit.

03:03.846 --> 03:05.262
No, don't get up.

03:05.346 --> 03:06.725
I got it.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.635
Just stay there
in your comfortable chair.

03:10.061 --> 03:13.147
Oh! Man, that guy's heavy.

03:13.888 --> 03:16.249
- Who's this?
- You know who that is.

03:16.639 --> 03:17.929
Can't say I do.

03:18.012 --> 03:20.554
Sully "Pretty Boy" O'Grady.
I'm here to collect.

03:20.638 --> 03:21.850
Oh, would you look
at that?

03:21.936 --> 03:23.757
I was gonna go get him
meself this afternoon.

03:23.843 --> 03:25.405
Oh, well, it looks
like I beat you to it.

03:25.491 --> 03:27.471
But you're used to
my sloppy seconds, aren't you?

03:27.554 --> 03:29.374
Not sloppy the way I do it.
And this...

03:29.460 --> 03:31.176
Little messier job
than I would have done,

03:31.262 --> 03:32.949
but good effort...
Solid effort, solid effort.

03:33.035 --> 03:35.012
All right, let me see
what I got here for you.

03:36.596 --> 03:38.387
Okay...

03:40.304 --> 03:42.220
Kind of in a hurry.
Been gone for five days.

03:42.304 --> 03:44.596
Really like to see Larry
before his naptime.

03:45.069 --> 03:46.777
Speed it up maybe.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.983
The town of Boston
appreciates your effort.

03:50.069 --> 03:51.512
Thank you.

03:51.596 --> 03:53.163
Uh, maybe you don't know
how to count,

03:53.249 --> 03:55.707
- 'cause you shorted me 20.
- Oh, that's cowboy tax.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.613
- A cowboy what?
- Cowboy tax.

03:58.843 --> 04:00.574
I mean, it's lucky you're not
a cowboy of color.

04:00.660 --> 04:03.012
It would've cost you
15 extra buckaroos.

04:03.095 --> 04:04.975
I risked my life out there.

04:05.264 --> 04:06.929
Isn't the reward
in your heart enough?

04:07.012 --> 04:08.846
You saved the man's life.

04:09.866 --> 04:11.262
All right,
Sheriff Nelson,

04:11.436 --> 04:14.262
I really need that money for my
half of the preschool deposit.

04:14.346 --> 04:16.882
Oh, that's you and Rafi's
responsibility.

04:16.975 --> 04:19.718
You give a man a fish,
you feed him for a day.

04:19.851 --> 04:22.183
You teach a man to fish,
he learns now to fish,

04:22.269 --> 04:24.780
he catches that fish,
and gives it to his kid.

04:27.944 --> 04:29.804
You know, I'll find
that money somewhere else.

04:29.888 --> 04:32.468
- I'll win it tonight in poker.
- Okay.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.973
Have a good day.

04:35.846 --> 04:38.960
Hey, Alice,
got another roommate.

04:40.854 --> 04:42.313
<i>Hey, cowboy!</i>

04:51.012 --> 04:53.220
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hold your horses there.

04:53.304 --> 04:55.647
You know you got to nickel up.
Right. There you go.

04:55.733 --> 04:57.554
Hoo-eee!
That'll get you 30 minutes

04:57.638 --> 04:59.095
in a little piece of Heaven.

04:59.179 --> 05:00.970
Hey, Jackie.

05:01.054 --> 05:03.970
Fill these up and then
water 'em down like we do.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.304
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, babe.

05:06.387 --> 05:08.012
Hi, you.

05:08.095 --> 05:10.363
Hi. Want to give me kisses?

05:11.512 --> 05:13.137
What's the matter
with you?

05:13.220 --> 05:15.137
Huh? You okay?
What happened?

05:15.220 --> 05:16.512
Someone
touch your privates?

05:16.596 --> 05:18.346
Oh, Bridge, no, he's good.

05:18.429 --> 05:20.387
- Hair of the dog, Bridge.
- Sure.

05:20.471 --> 05:21.970
I mean,
look at that boy.

05:22.054 --> 05:24.179
He's perfectly fine,
and he's gorgeous, to boot.

05:24.262 --> 05:26.429
Ma, don't objectify him.
We talked about that.

05:26.512 --> 05:28.970
- Okay.
- Here you go, little Lar.

05:29.202 --> 05:31.827
Cheers. Mama's home.

05:36.613 --> 05:37.924
Something seems off with him.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.554
Well, you know what
they say, Bridgette.

05:39.638 --> 05:41.527
Broken home, broken heart.

05:41.660 --> 05:43.554
He'll be fine when he gets
into that city school

05:43.638 --> 05:44.916
and out of this place.

05:45.002 --> 05:47.554
You think that city school's
gonna solve every problem?

05:47.638 --> 05:48.965
Better than things
around here.

05:49.051 --> 05:50.988
- What are these?
- Pretty good toys.

05:51.074 --> 05:52.681
- Those are Lincoln Logs.
- You know what kind of toys

05:52.767 --> 05:54.127
- they have at the city school?
- No, I don't.

05:54.213 --> 05:55.658
Neither do I, but they're
better than these things.

05:55.744 --> 05:57.429
Well, I'm just telling you
right now, Bridgette,

05:57.512 --> 05:59.220
paying as much
as a plot of land

05:59.304 --> 06:01.179
for one year of pre-K is dumb.

06:01.262 --> 06:03.387
Rafi's paying half,
so it ain't that bad.

06:03.527 --> 06:05.580
Speaking of which,
I need to borrow 20.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.304
No way, Bridgette.
Get your hands out of there.

06:07.449 --> 06:09.137
- Come on, Mom.
- I work hard, Bridgette,

06:09.220 --> 06:10.804
in order to save every penny

06:10.888 --> 06:12.596
to try to buy this place
from Mr. D.

06:12.679 --> 06:14.721
Maybe you should raise
the prices around here.

06:14.804 --> 06:17.426
Listen, these are
townspeople, Bridgette.

06:17.512 --> 06:19.304
They can't afford
high prices.

06:19.387 --> 06:21.304
The only one who can
afford it is Mr. Daddy.

06:21.387 --> 06:23.054
But then he come in
every Sunday,

06:23.137 --> 06:25.304
and he drink what he like,
and he fuck what he like...

06:25.387 --> 06:27.054
Excuse my language...and then
he gets everything for free.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.429
How's that for irony?

06:28.512 --> 06:29.957
You know what irony is?

06:30.043 --> 06:31.504
It's like when people
have money,

06:31.590 --> 06:33.638
but then they always
never have the cash on 'em.

06:33.721 --> 06:36.054
- He knows what irony is.
- He ain't a dumb kid.

06:36.137 --> 06:38.220
Seen Rafi? He was
supposed to meet me here.

06:38.304 --> 06:39.882
- Nope.
- You seen your daddy?

06:39.991 --> 06:41.118
- No.
- I think I seen him

06:41.204 --> 06:43.301
over at the church crying
his pretty little eyes out.

06:43.554 --> 06:45.387
Men and their emotions.

06:45.471 --> 06:46.541
- Yes, indeed.
- Uh-huh.

06:46.627 --> 06:47.728
I'm gonna go find him.

06:47.814 --> 06:48.642
You want to come with me,

06:48.728 --> 06:50.072
- find your daddy?
- No.

06:51.763 --> 06:52.970
Keep an eye on him.

06:53.054 --> 06:54.596
Like a hawk.

06:54.679 --> 06:56.304

07:15.929 --> 07:16.970
on an empty audience.

07:17.054 --> 07:18.638
You stood me up.

07:18.721 --> 07:20.929
No, I-I was gonna come
a-and see you.

07:21.012 --> 07:22.846
- I-I just wanted...
- Rafi, quit stammering.

07:22.929 --> 07:25.054
I just don't got
the money for Larry, Bridgette.

07:25.137 --> 07:27.929
God damn you!
If you think for one second

07:28.012 --> 07:30.304
I'm gonna let you play house
with that sheriff

07:30.387 --> 07:32.721
while you forget
about your little boy,

07:32.804 --> 07:34.262
- you got another thing coming.
- It ain't like that.

07:34.346 --> 07:35.429
I've been saving
every nickel

07:35.512 --> 07:37.054
since I bought
that stupid ring.

07:37.137 --> 07:38.512
I just got bamboozled.

07:38.596 --> 07:40.679
- What?
- I got bamboozled.

07:40.763 --> 07:42.304
Oh, God.

07:42.387 --> 07:43.929
Don't start crying.

07:44.012 --> 07:46.012
Ruin your pretty face.

07:46.095 --> 07:48.387
Rafi, what'd you get
yourself into?

07:48.471 --> 07:50.888
I took a payday loan
from Mr. Daddy.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.512
I was gonna give you the money
as soon as I got home.

07:53.596 --> 07:55.179
I wanted to surprise you.
It's just...

07:55.262 --> 07:57.554
the interest was so high!

07:57.638 --> 08:00.137
A-and before I knew it,
they roughed me up.

08:00.220 --> 08:03.137
They took back everything
they loaned me and then some.

08:03.220 --> 08:06.137
You mean to tell me in trying
to get a little cash,

08:06.220 --> 08:08.596
you lost all the cash?

08:08.679 --> 08:11.179
All I have left
to my name is

08:11.262 --> 08:13.970
this canary-yellow ribbon.

08:14.054 --> 08:16.179
Jesus Christ.

08:16.262 --> 08:19.179
Men and money.

08:19.262 --> 08:20.554
I'm sorry, Bridgette.

08:20.638 --> 08:22.596
You know what?
Sorry's not gonna cut it.

08:22.679 --> 08:24.471
We got to put down
that deposit by tomorrow,

08:24.554 --> 08:26.220
or Larry's
gonna lose his spot.

08:26.304 --> 08:27.804
Oh, no, we can't
let that happen.

08:27.888 --> 08:29.471
No, we can't.

08:29.554 --> 08:30.888
- Well, what should we do?
- I don't know.

08:30.970 --> 08:32.679
- You got any ideas?
- Yes.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.679
I think we could...

08:34.763 --> 08:36.881
Maybe we...

08:37.304 --> 08:39.054
- No, I don't have any idea.
- Yeah, well, that's cause

08:39.136 --> 08:41.475
there's only one thing
we can do.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.471
What's that?

08:44.304 --> 08:46.757
I got to stick up
that payday loan office,

08:46.843 --> 08:48.346
and you got to
show me where it's at.

08:48.429 --> 08:50.554
Nuh-uh, I'm not doing that.
Uh-uh, that's dangerous.

08:50.638 --> 08:52.346
I've heard some
scary stories, Bridgette.

08:52.429 --> 08:54.387
I'm not scared
of no stories.

08:54.471 --> 08:56.137
- Let's go.
- Well, you know what?

08:56.220 --> 08:57.712
I think I'll just stay
and watch Larry...

08:57.798 --> 08:58.782
- Get up!
- Okay.

08:58.868 --> 09:00.743
- Let's go.
- Okay, all right.

09:01.012 --> 09:02.220
Bridgette!

09:14.471 --> 09:16.220
It smells delicious.

09:16.304 --> 09:17.846
You know rabbit foot's
good luck?

09:17.929 --> 09:19.471
Not for that rabbit.

09:19.554 --> 09:21.512
Hopefully for us tomorrow.
Here, it's all ready.

09:21.596 --> 09:23.346
- All right, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.095
My blood sugar
was in the basement.

09:26.471 --> 09:28.012
Don't burnt your tongue.

09:28.095 --> 09:29.804
Ahh...

09:29.888 --> 09:32.012
- Look at all them stars.
- Mm.

09:32.095 --> 09:33.679
Makes you feel
less alone, don't it?

09:33.763 --> 09:35.262
Sure do.

09:35.346 --> 09:37.457
Don't you start
counting them either.

09:37.607 --> 09:38.941
I know how you like to
do that.

09:39.027 --> 09:40.638
How many you reckon
are there?

09:40.721 --> 09:42.855
- I don't know. A lot.
- One hundred?

09:42.996 --> 09:44.596
I don't know, Rafi.

09:44.679 --> 09:46.605
I don't think
you could ever count 'em.

09:46.691 --> 09:49.262
- Two hundred.
- You really can't guess.

09:49.346 --> 09:50.846
There's at least 400 up there.

09:50.929 --> 09:53.471
Okay, that's enough.

09:53.629 --> 09:56.304
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Bridgette, what was that?

09:56.387 --> 09:58.452
My six-shooter's cocked!

09:58.616 --> 10:00.358
Now come out
with your hands up

10:00.444 --> 10:01.804
where I can see 'em.

10:03.471 --> 10:04.639
Ally?

10:04.725 --> 10:09.218
Bridge!
Oh, am I glad to see you!

10:09.304 --> 10:11.186
You're the last person
I expected to see here.

10:11.272 --> 10:14.780
Oh, I smelled that
from a literal mile away.

10:14.866 --> 10:16.483
Do you think I could
just have a little nibble?

10:16.569 --> 10:18.888
Yeah, sure, you can have some.
I-it's just a little bit hot.

10:18.970 --> 10:21.179
- You might want to wait for...
- Mm. It smelled so much better

10:21.265 --> 10:22.249
than it looks.

10:22.335 --> 10:25.554
Ugh, forget it.
I am exhausted.

10:26.288 --> 10:27.608
Ahh.

10:27.694 --> 10:30.444
What are you doing out here all
by your lonesome, Miss Ally?

10:30.530 --> 10:33.093
It's a sad, long story.

10:33.194 --> 10:34.944
I don't really feel like
getting into it.

10:35.030 --> 10:36.638
Well, we were about to
go to bed.

10:36.721 --> 10:38.471
- But since you asked...
- Okay.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.679
Mr. Daddy and I
have finally split up.

10:40.763 --> 10:43.512
So now I'm shacked up
with my kids down by the creek,

10:43.596 --> 10:45.888
which Ida insisted
has fish in it,

10:45.970 --> 10:47.512
but it doesn't have
fish in it.

10:47.596 --> 10:49.471
It only has cattail
and arrowroot,

10:49.554 --> 10:51.012
which tastes like shit!

10:51.095 --> 10:52.804
You mean to tell me
you got nothing

10:52.888 --> 10:54.561
from Mr. Daddy
in the separation?

10:54.647 --> 10:57.968
No. The minute that
I told him I was gonna file,

10:58.124 --> 10:59.468
he kicked me
out of the house.

10:59.554 --> 11:01.262
And then he went
and bought up

11:01.346 --> 11:03.804
every single damn lawyer
in this town.

11:03.888 --> 11:07.012
And he's frozen my line of
credit at the general store.

11:07.095 --> 11:09.304
I mean, I have nothing.

11:09.387 --> 11:11.888
You gave it all up for him
and got nothing in return.

11:11.970 --> 11:14.095
- Nothing!
- Nothing!

11:14.179 --> 11:15.596
And you're someone
who had everything.

11:15.679 --> 11:17.249
Yeah, I used to have
everything.

11:17.335 --> 11:18.843
- Didn't I, Bridgette?
- You had those kids.

11:18.944 --> 11:20.804
You had that nice house.
You have the degree,

11:20.888 --> 11:22.888
the clothes, the jewels,
that body.

11:22.970 --> 11:24.220
- Everything.
- Now you got nothing.

11:24.304 --> 11:25.721
- Nothing.
- And now all you're doing

11:25.804 --> 11:27.970
is living in a wagon
down by the river.

11:28.054 --> 11:30.721
Yes! It's a creek.
We prefer creek.

11:30.804 --> 11:33.233
You know what?
You should come with us.

11:33.319 --> 11:34.846
We're gonna get
my money back

11:34.929 --> 11:37.179
from your fella's
payday loan operation.

11:37.262 --> 11:38.858
- 'Cause we're outlaws.
- Yeah.

11:38.944 --> 11:40.772
It's about time you got yours.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.468
- And you know something?
- What?

11:42.554 --> 11:44.346
I used to be
the fastest gun in the West.

11:44.429 --> 11:45.710
How come you never
said nothing?

11:45.796 --> 11:46.929
Because I'm probably also

11:47.012 --> 11:48.888
the humblest person
in the West.

11:48.970 --> 11:50.596
Well, that's for sure.

11:50.679 --> 11:52.936
But I don't know...I mean,
that was a long time ago.

11:53.022 --> 11:54.471
It was before I had kids.

11:54.554 --> 11:55.663
Look what I got right here.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.832
- Why don't you give it a spin?
- Oh.

11:58.304 --> 12:00.554
All right, maybe I will
give it a swirl.

12:00.638 --> 12:02.429
Just like falling off a bike.

12:02.512 --> 12:04.012
- Whoo!
- Oh!

12:04.095 --> 12:06.596
- Huh.
- Anybody shot?

12:06.679 --> 12:08.721
You just...

12:08.804 --> 12:10.220
want to be careful
with these things.

12:10.304 --> 12:12.137
Yeah.
Well, maybe we shouldn't

12:12.220 --> 12:13.888
make any rash decisions
tonight.

12:13.970 --> 12:17.095
You know what we should do?
Let's drink!

12:17.179 --> 12:20.179
Oh, you know, we actually have
to get up at sunup tomorrow.

12:20.262 --> 12:21.721
- Yes.
- Can't we just have one drink?

12:21.804 --> 12:23.554
I mean, one drink
isn't gonna hurt anybody.

12:23.638 --> 12:25.763
I guess one drink can't hurt.

12:29.439 --> 12:30.731
Ah, shit.

12:30.970 --> 12:32.494
Shit! Nelson!

12:32.580 --> 12:33.658
I swear it's not

12:33.744 --> 12:35.205
- what it looks like.
- Shh!

12:35.291 --> 12:37.301
What it looks like 
is you and Bridge ran off

12:37.387 --> 12:39.970
and took a little tumble
in the cabbages.

12:40.054 --> 12:41.721
I can explain. It gets cold
out here on the plains,

12:41.804 --> 12:43.638
and I thought we could
use our bodies to keep warm.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.846
Did you know that adultery
is not just forbidden by God

12:45.929 --> 12:47.763
but by the law?
I could have you hanged.

12:47.846 --> 12:49.596
That's kind of extreme,
Sheriff.

12:49.679 --> 12:50.846
Well, jailed, then.

12:50.929 --> 12:52.137
Nonetheless,
you're under arrest.

12:52.220 --> 12:53.468
- Come on.
- Under arrest?

12:53.554 --> 12:55.970
No, wait a damn minute.
You can't arrest me.

12:56.054 --> 12:58.093
All I'm doing out here
is trying to get the money back

12:58.179 --> 12:59.749
from the bastards
that took it from this guy.

12:59.835 --> 13:01.780
Well, then you're under
arrest for vigilantism, too.

13:01.866 --> 13:04.220
You just think
you can ride on in

13:04.304 --> 13:05.888
with your little horse

13:05.970 --> 13:07.970
and just be Rafi's hero,
don't you?

13:08.054 --> 13:10.721
No. I could give
two shits about him.

13:10.804 --> 13:12.763
I'm doing this for my kid.

13:12.846 --> 13:14.220
- That's mean, Bridgette.
- She doesn't mean it.

13:14.304 --> 13:16.012
- Why would she say that?
- She doesn't mean that.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.970
Is that why you dropped
your knickers for him

13:18.054 --> 13:20.304
- the other night, then?
- I was hot. So sue me.

13:20.387 --> 13:22.179
And also, sometimes
I like to get naked

13:22.262 --> 13:23.929
when I'm angry, and your man
really ticked me off.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.804
You know what, Bridgette?

13:25.888 --> 13:27.804
Larry doesn't need
a better school.

13:27.888 --> 13:30.346
- He needs a better mother.
- Oh, shit!

13:30.429 --> 13:32.638
- Those are fighting words.
- Just get out the way.

13:32.721 --> 13:34.304
Stay down, bitch!

13:34.387 --> 13:36.346
Why do you women always
have to resort to violence?

13:36.429 --> 13:38.512
You little liar!

13:38.596 --> 13:40.929
- Aah!
- Ooh! Because it's fun!

13:41.012 --> 13:42.679
I'll fucking fight you,
you fucking dickhead.

13:42.763 --> 13:45.095
Oh, I wish I had
two cowboys fighting over me.

13:48.846 --> 13:50.429
I wouldn't
have said that...

13:50.512 --> 13:51.970
Ow!

13:53.179 --> 13:55.471
Oh, shit.
You shot me.

13:55.554 --> 13:57.346
I shot you in the foot.
I shot you in the foot.

13:57.429 --> 13:59.058
- You don't fight fair!
- I don't know what happened.

13:59.144 --> 14:01.054
- I just... I b-blacked out.
- I got to get out of here.

14:01.137 --> 14:02.929
- Bridgette, are you okay?
- Um, I'm okay.

14:03.012 --> 14:04.554
- Bridgette...
- I've never been shot before.

14:04.638 --> 14:06.304
- Don't walk on it.
- Where are you going?

14:06.387 --> 14:08.137
I've never been in more pain
in my entire life.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.721
Oh, people get shot in the foot
all the time.

14:09.804 --> 14:11.471
I don't think
you're in any condition...

14:11.554 --> 14:13.471
- I'm okay.
- ...to be walking right now,

14:13.554 --> 14:14.929
Bridgette...
I really don't, I think...

14:15.012 --> 14:16.721
- Nope, nope...
- Just stay away from me.

14:16.804 --> 14:18.888
- Oh...
- You and I need to have

14:18.970 --> 14:19.638
- a little chat, mister.
- About what?

14:19.721 --> 14:21.387
Sit down!

14:21.471 --> 14:22.929
- She cheated!
- Bridgette.

14:23.012 --> 14:24.970
Let me help you.
I'm here to help.

14:25.054 --> 14:26.512
- Take my hand. Bridge...
- I'm gonna survive.

14:26.596 --> 14:28.304
- I'm gonna survive.
- Oh. Oh, Bridgette.

14:28.387 --> 14:30.054
- They touched you?
- No.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.785
- They didn't rape you?
- Didn't rape me.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.343
They didn't fondle
your little butthole?

14:33.429 --> 14:34.596
As far as I know.

14:34.679 --> 14:36.471
All we had
was a relaxing night.

14:36.554 --> 14:39.512
You had an R&R?
That's even worse!

14:39.596 --> 14:41.554
- Is the wrong...
- Oh...

14:41.638 --> 14:42.929
Can I give you
a little boost?

14:43.012 --> 14:44.554
- A boost?
- Nope.

14:44.638 --> 14:46.095
- I got it.
- Oh...

14:46.179 --> 14:47.528
I made it up.

14:47.614 --> 14:49.169
I know you're worried,
but you got to...

14:49.255 --> 14:50.888
You got to ride
like the wind, okay?

14:50.970 --> 14:52.846
Come on.
Get me to the doc.

14:52.929 --> 14:56.346
You're gonna
ride it like that?

15:09.512 --> 15:10.888
Aah...

15:10.970 --> 15:12.804
Just a few more
stitches.

15:12.888 --> 15:14.471
Looks like Larry's gonna be
a townie after all.

15:14.554 --> 15:15.888
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

15:15.970 --> 15:17.262
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

15:17.346 --> 15:18.392
No, he ain't.

15:18.478 --> 15:19.642
You always thought
you were better than us.

15:19.728 --> 15:21.677
It's true, Bridge...you do think
you're better than us.

15:21.763 --> 15:23.346
- Yeah.
- Mm-mm.

15:23.429 --> 15:24.763
Well, you guys don't get it.

15:24.846 --> 15:26.304
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

15:26.387 --> 15:27.304
- We don't get it?
- No, you don't get it.

15:27.387 --> 15:28.846
You think if you send Larry

15:28.929 --> 15:30.596
to that fancy school,
he's gonna escape

15:30.679 --> 15:33.429
the fate given
to all of us.

15:33.512 --> 15:35.346
- Fine. You get it.
- Right.

15:35.429 --> 15:37.179
That school ain't
help me none.

15:37.262 --> 15:39.429
All I'm saying is things are
how they are, Bridgette.

15:39.512 --> 15:40.679
You try to change 'em,

15:40.765 --> 15:42.429
and you end up getting
shot in the foot.

15:42.512 --> 15:43.846
You ever
get shot before?

15:43.929 --> 15:45.970
- Not once.
- Oh. I'm gonna be sick.

15:46.054 --> 15:47.429
- You are?
- Bull...maybe the bullet

15:47.512 --> 15:48.846
- poisoned me.
- No.

15:48.929 --> 15:50.387
- Do I have the gangrene?
- No.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.054
Ah! Game!

15:52.137 --> 15:53.638
I did it!

15:53.721 --> 15:55.888
- You saved my life.
- I did, didn't I?

15:55.970 --> 15:57.721
- Yeah.
- I mean, it could go septic,

15:57.804 --> 16:00.602
and you could die, but...
I own that.

16:00.688 --> 16:02.063
You know, you're really
good at that.

16:02.149 --> 16:03.471
You got...you got
a delicate touch.

16:03.554 --> 16:05.929
I was good at Operation
as a child.

16:06.012 --> 16:08.471
Oof, it really hurts,
Doctor.

16:08.554 --> 16:10.429
Some herb for the pain.

16:10.512 --> 16:13.970
- That'll help.
- Some good old sativa for you.

16:15.929 --> 16:18.095
- All right.
- Where you going?

16:19.137 --> 16:21.679
I'm going to blow off
some steam...

16:21.763 --> 16:24.262
...with my friend upstairs.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.638
Come on.

16:30.721 --> 16:32.929
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

16:33.012 --> 16:35.387
Where are you today?
Come on.

16:35.471 --> 16:36.554
I don't know.
It's not working.

16:36.638 --> 16:38.012
Get off.

16:38.095 --> 16:39.888
I'll just do it myself.

16:39.970 --> 16:42.262
Yes. You don't want to
get stuck with blue clit.

16:42.346 --> 16:43.596
Ah, come on.

16:43.679 --> 16:45.596
Come on.

16:45.679 --> 16:47.137
You can...

16:47.220 --> 16:49.054
- Mm...
- There you go.

16:49.137 --> 16:51.429
God damn it!
I can't get hard.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.054
It's not something
to be ashamed of.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.095
It happens
to the best of them.

16:55.179 --> 16:56.970
Not to me, it don't.

16:57.054 --> 16:58.471
You know, we don't
have to do it

16:58.554 --> 17:00.804
every single time.

17:00.888 --> 17:03.095
Some cowboys
just pay me to listen.

17:03.179 --> 17:04.804
That wouldn't work for me.

17:04.887 --> 17:06.429
I'm a woman
of few words, George.

17:06.512 --> 17:08.804
I know.

17:08.887 --> 17:11.637
So try me.

17:11.721 --> 17:13.346
Hmm.

17:13.429 --> 17:15.846
I don't know.

17:15.929 --> 17:17.637
Maybe my mom was right.

17:17.721 --> 17:20.012
I shouldn't expect things
from Rafi, you know?

17:20.095 --> 17:22.596
Especially now
that he's marrying that cunt.

17:22.679 --> 17:25.054
- She is a cunt.
- Right?

17:25.137 --> 17:27.387
- The biggest cunt.
- Such a cunt.

17:27.471 --> 17:28.471
Massive, yeah.

17:31.012 --> 17:32.804
And if I'm honest
with myself,

17:32.888 --> 17:35.095
I can't give Larry
a better life.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.596
I mean, look what
it's brought me to.

17:37.679 --> 17:41.095
I get in a shootout
with my son's stepmom.

17:41.179 --> 17:42.846
There's no winning, is there?

17:42.929 --> 17:45.512
I might as well just accept it
and give up.

17:45.596 --> 17:47.137
No, no, no, no, no.

17:47.220 --> 17:48.220
- Bridgette.
- What?

17:48.304 --> 17:49.846
You do not give up.

17:49.929 --> 17:51.346
Oh, George.

17:51.429 --> 17:53.220
Look at my situation.

17:53.304 --> 17:55.179
I was granted safe passage
by Mr. Daddy.

17:55.262 --> 17:57.137
- Mm-hmm.
- He promised me a job

17:57.220 --> 17:59.262
as a messenger
for telegrams.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.929
I thought, I give people
good news.

18:01.012 --> 18:02.596
That makes me feel good.

18:02.679 --> 18:04.721
- That sounds nice.
- I love giving people

18:04.804 --> 18:06.888
good news...
I was very excited.

18:06.970 --> 18:10.012
And then I woke up drugged
and on a ship.

18:10.095 --> 18:13.679
And now here I am in Boston
working as sex for...

18:13.763 --> 18:15.888
hoping I can get
my freedom someday.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.512
Wait.

18:18.596 --> 18:20.679
You don't enjoy this?

18:21.804 --> 18:23.929
Oh. Oh! No, Bridgette.

18:24.012 --> 18:26.137
Oh, with you, I...
I love it.

18:26.220 --> 18:29.012
It's... the best
I've ever had.

18:29.095 --> 18:30.512
- Okay.
- You're very good.

18:30.596 --> 18:32.304
Oh. Thank you.

18:32.387 --> 18:34.638
But with all
of the other women...

18:34.721 --> 18:37.054
it causes me great pain.

18:37.137 --> 18:39.346
I'm so sorry.

18:39.429 --> 18:41.304
- He did this to you?
- Yes.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.304
Oh...

18:43.387 --> 18:46.012
I will have that
forever.

18:46.095 --> 18:49.888
And I will not stop
fighting

18:49.970 --> 18:51.804
and trying to get
my freedom back.

18:51.929 --> 18:53.179
I will not stop trying,

18:53.262 --> 18:55.554
and you cannot stop
trying either.

18:55.638 --> 18:59.012
You sweet,
beautiful dumb whore.

18:59.095 --> 19:01.429
Those are nice words,
George.

19:01.512 --> 19:03.846
Those are only words.

19:03.929 --> 19:06.679
The sooner you learn that,

19:06.763 --> 19:08.804
the better.

19:08.888 --> 19:10.346
Clean yourself up.

19:12.846 --> 19:14.095
Bye, cowboy.

19:22.095 --> 19:23.512
Stop crying.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.512
Go inside and wipe
those tears away.

19:25.596 --> 19:27.763
Okay, okay, okay.

19:31.095 --> 19:32.429
It's just that
we're family.

19:32.512 --> 19:34.137
I don't want you
around her.

19:34.220 --> 19:35.596
She's just trying
to get to me.

19:35.679 --> 19:37.970
Oh, she means well.
Families fight.

19:38.054 --> 19:40.262
Besides, it's not about you.
It's about Larry.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.970
Do it for me and Larry.

19:49.512 --> 19:51.596
Aw, shit.

19:51.679 --> 19:54.054
So what do you
think, Bridgette?

19:54.137 --> 19:55.679
Call.

19:55.763 --> 19:57.012
- What you got?
- Trips.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.137
Ah. Aces full.

19:59.442 --> 20:01.554
Shit. It's all right.

20:01.638 --> 20:03.679
You need the money more than
I do. Use it for the saloon.

20:03.763 --> 20:05.554
Oh? What about
your fancy school?

20:05.638 --> 20:08.095
Nah, took your advice. He's
gonna go to the townie school

20:08.179 --> 20:09.262
- like the rest of us.
- Mm.

20:09.346 --> 20:10.679
Well, then can I have
the money?

20:10.763 --> 20:12.471
'Cause my Evie
has the lead poisoning

20:12.554 --> 20:14.983
from the polluted well water
in Mr. Daddy's coal mine.

20:15.069 --> 20:16.512
Evie looks all right
to me.

20:16.596 --> 20:18.471
Yeah, I mean,
lead never hurt nobody.

20:18.554 --> 20:21.095
- Look at us. We're fine.
- I could use it, too.

20:21.179 --> 20:23.429
My niece is sitting in a cage
on the border

20:23.512 --> 20:25.638
- since her mom got deported.
- Yeah, right.

20:25.721 --> 20:27.679
Stop your lying.
This is America.

20:27.763 --> 20:28.888
- We don't put kids in cages!
- Come on, that is bull!

20:28.970 --> 20:30.471
Shit. I'm 25.

20:30.554 --> 20:33.429
All I want to do
is own my own cage.

20:33.512 --> 20:35.970
Mr. Daddy...he owns
all the housing stocks.

20:36.054 --> 20:37.679
- Asshole.
- Well...

20:37.763 --> 20:39.679
divvy it up however
you guys see fit.

20:39.763 --> 20:42.012
All righty.

20:42.095 --> 20:43.596
All right,
we gonna play again?

20:43.679 --> 20:45.429
Well, it's
a two-dollar buy-in, Bridge.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.012
Uh, in that case,
deal me out

20:47.095 --> 20:48.429
and pour me another.

20:48.512 --> 20:50.054
Not so fast.

20:50.137 --> 20:53.054
Oh, look, it's the Sheriff.

20:53.137 --> 20:55.262
What, did you come to shoot me
in the other foot?

20:55.346 --> 20:57.970
Came to cover you.

20:58.054 --> 21:00.095
Why would you do that?

21:00.179 --> 21:02.429
'Cause we're family.

21:04.387 --> 21:06.804
I don't know about all that,
but I'll take it.

21:06.888 --> 21:09.262
All right, deal me in.

21:09.346 --> 21:10.679
Ante up, everybody.

21:13.387 --> 21:15.804
- What the...
- What's that?

21:15.888 --> 21:18.888
Cowboy tax.

21:18.970 --> 21:21.054
I don't know what to say.

21:21.137 --> 21:23.136
- Let's play again.
- I don't want to play.

21:23.222 --> 21:24.554
Come on, Larry.

21:24.638 --> 21:26.137
I give up.

21:26.220 --> 21:27.721
Hey.

21:27.804 --> 21:30.137
What did you just say?

21:30.220 --> 21:31.304
- I give up.
- No, no, no.

21:31.387 --> 21:32.763
You can't give up.

21:32.846 --> 21:35.846
No, we don't give up
in this family.

21:35.929 --> 21:38.763
What'd I teach you
about the cowboy code?

21:38.846 --> 21:40.512
What's a cowboy code?

21:40.596 --> 21:42.346
You know what
the cowboy code is.

21:42.429 --> 21:44.137
It means
if you're down and out,

21:44.220 --> 21:46.387
you dust off your boots
and get back on that horse.

21:46.471 --> 21:49.095
Hey, look at me.
You hear what I'm saying?

21:49.179 --> 21:52.304
- Mm, no.
- Aw, come on, Lar.

21:55.596 --> 21:56.929
Aw, shit.

21:57.012 --> 21:59.679
Here the bastard comes now.

21:59.763 --> 22:01.970
Oh, Jackie,
line up the boys.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.804
- Well, what if you didn't?
- What do you mean?

22:04.888 --> 22:08.012
I Just mean what kind of
example are we setting, Ma?

22:08.095 --> 22:09.970
See what just happened?

22:12.804 --> 22:13.970
I'm a Bird.

22:14.054 --> 22:16.512
You are a Bird.

22:16.596 --> 22:18.346
And no cage ensnares us.

22:18.429 --> 22:19.846
Ain't that why our granny

22:19.929 --> 22:21.763
settled out here
in the first place?

22:21.846 --> 22:24.304
So we could live our lives
how we wanted to live 'em.

22:24.387 --> 22:26.429
Instead, we just ended up
as doormats

22:26.512 --> 22:28.095
for Mr. Daddy
to wipe his boots off on.

22:28.179 --> 22:31.054
I don't know about y'all,

22:31.137 --> 22:33.012
but that ain't why
I wear this hat.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.970
I put on this Stetson,
and I feel my ma.

22:38.054 --> 22:39.763
That's you.
And I feel my ma's ma.

22:39.846 --> 22:41.387
- That's Grandma.
- Yeah.

22:41.471 --> 22:44.846
I feel my grandma's ma
and my grandma's ma's ma

22:44.929 --> 22:48.137
and my grandma's ma's ma's
ma's ma.

22:48.220 --> 22:50.137
I love our grandma's
grandma's ma.

22:50.220 --> 22:51.679
- Yeah.
- All those women

22:51.763 --> 22:53.721
taught me what true grit
really was.

22:53.804 --> 22:54.970
Ain't that right, Ma?

22:55.054 --> 22:56.471
Well, yeah.

22:56.554 --> 22:58.596
I mean, they were fighters.

22:58.679 --> 23:01.970
They fought so we could have
a better life than they did.

23:02.054 --> 23:04.429
If we just roll over...

23:04.512 --> 23:06.679
kind of like pissing
on their tombstones.

23:06.763 --> 23:09.095
And I don't want to piss
on their tombstones no more.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.346
Me neither.

23:13.304 --> 23:16.763
A wise whore once told me
to never give up.

23:16.846 --> 23:19.012
So we can stay here,
let Mr. Daddy screw us

23:19.095 --> 23:20.804
six ways to Sunday,

23:20.888 --> 23:23.179
or we could go confront
his greedy ass,

23:23.262 --> 23:25.054
take back what's ours,
and live by a code

23:25.137 --> 23:25.970
worthy of this hat.

23:26.054 --> 23:27.846
So who's with me?

23:27.929 --> 23:29.346
- Whoo!
- Me too!

23:29.429 --> 23:31.763
#MeToo! Hell, yeah.

23:31.846 --> 23:33.736
We can shoot some shots,
though, first, right?

23:33.822 --> 23:35.429
- Yeah!
- Give me my gun!

23:35.512 --> 23:37.304
We're gonna need guns
and bullets.

23:37.387 --> 23:39.763
Load 'em up, boys.
Load 'em up.

23:39.846 --> 23:42.012
- Get off the street!
- Get off the street!

23:50.387 --> 23:52.763
Help me, help me!

23:56.220 --> 23:57.554
Get out
of that there saloon.

23:57.638 --> 23:59.304
Sorry! Sorry!
Excuse us!

23:59.387 --> 24:00.596
- Sorry!
- Excuse us!

24:03.554 --> 24:06.638
Well, look here, boys.

24:06.721 --> 24:09.262
Today, Mr. D.,
is collections day.

24:09.346 --> 24:11.804
No more damn freebees
at the saloon.

24:11.888 --> 24:13.638
Time's up.

24:13.721 --> 24:16.387
No more raping, pillaging,
murdering, stealing,

24:16.471 --> 24:18.137
philandering, deporting...

24:18.220 --> 24:19.512
There's so many.
What else is there?

24:19.596 --> 24:20.888
The poisoning.

24:20.970 --> 24:22.314
The poisoning.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.885
Yeah. It's about time
that you wrote us

24:23.971 --> 24:25.165
a big-ass check

24:25.251 --> 24:26.837
and got the hell up
out of this town.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.969
I'd suggest you ladies take
your hands off them holsters

24:29.055 --> 24:30.337
if you know
what's good for you.

24:30.423 --> 24:32.012
Last chance, Mr. Daddy.

24:34.387 --> 24:36.304
Okay, that's gross.

24:36.387 --> 24:37.763
And I'd suggest you comply,

24:37.846 --> 24:40.262
and may the Holy Mother
have mercy on your soul.

24:51.179 --> 24:53.846
- What the hell?
- What the fuck, Jackie?

24:53.929 --> 24:56.554
Seriously, I had no idea
how that happened.

24:56.638 --> 24:59.721
Draw, boys!

24:59.804 --> 25:02.137
Cover, cover, boys!

25:07.638 --> 25:10.512
I am Shiva,
Goddess of Destruction!

25:11.679 --> 25:12.929
You protect Mr. Daddy!

25:13.012 --> 25:15.220
Aah!

25:15.304 --> 25:18.012
Whoo!
Good burn, baby!

25:20.304 --> 25:22.179
Shit.

25:22.262 --> 25:24.471
Bridge,
we're outgunned.

25:24.554 --> 25:27.137
I know.

25:27.220 --> 25:28.846
Stay down, Evie!
Stay down!

25:30.137 --> 25:31.638
Hey...

25:31.721 --> 25:33.888
I'm sorry
about the lap dance.

25:33.970 --> 25:37.638
I get why you'd be hotter than
blue blazes over that, okay?

25:37.721 --> 25:40.596
And I'm sorry about the drunken
2 a.m. phone calls

25:40.679 --> 25:43.262
and the "throwing farts" game
we do.

25:43.346 --> 25:46.970
- And the "pet the kitty"?
- Yeah. That too.

25:47.054 --> 25:48.763
Oh, shit.
But I promise you...

25:48.846 --> 25:50.804
If we get out of here alive,
I'm gonna do better.

25:50.888 --> 25:51.846
- Okay.
- Okay?

25:51.929 --> 25:53.679
Okay. Okay.

25:53.763 --> 25:55.763
What's the plan now,
partner?

26:03.763 --> 26:06.429
There's only one thing
we can do.

26:06.512 --> 26:08.804
Give them bastards hell.

26:08.888 --> 26:10.179
Shit!

26:23.220 --> 26:25.179
End of the road,
ladies.

26:25.262 --> 26:27.596
- And I'm still standing.
- Bridge.

26:27.679 --> 26:29.262
You want to know why?

26:29.346 --> 26:32.137
'Cause I got a big
swinging peckerwood,

26:32.220 --> 26:34.012
and so long as I do,

26:34.095 --> 26:37.471
Jesus Christ Himself
couldn't shoot me down.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.234
So let this be a lesson
to the rest of you.

26:41.763 --> 26:43.596
Any last words?

26:44.929 --> 26:47.012
I got one.

26:48.304 --> 26:49.220
Ally?

26:49.304 --> 26:51.804
Vasectomy.

26:51.888 --> 26:53.012
Ooh!

26:54.804 --> 26:57.512
I still got it.

27:00.095 --> 27:01.721
Yeah, you do.

27:01.804 --> 27:04.387
Ugh.

27:04.471 --> 27:07.137
Damn it! Ow! Ow!

27:10.012 --> 27:11.679
Guess whose birthday
it is next week.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.763
It's Larry's birthday!

27:13.846 --> 27:15.846
TJ wants to throw him
this big old party,

27:15.929 --> 27:17.763
so we're gonna do it
at her house.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.638
- I hope you can come.
- Oh, I'd love to come.

27:19.721 --> 27:20.888
I really would.
I'll get him a pony.

27:20.970 --> 27:22.679
You're gonna get him a pony?

27:22.763 --> 27:24.179
Yeah, I was just gonna
get him a pony.

27:24.262 --> 27:25.888
Oh, oh,
then you get him one.

27:25.970 --> 27:28.095
No, no, it's okay. I can't
really afford one anyways.

27:28.179 --> 27:29.888
- You get him the pony.
- Go halfsies?

27:29.970 --> 27:31.554
You can get two
and just say one's from me.

27:31.638 --> 27:33.554
Sure. Yeah.
I'd love to do that.

27:33.638 --> 27:36.304
- You can pay me back later.
- A rainbow pony.

27:36.387 --> 27:37.970
He wants a rainbow pony.

27:38.054 --> 27:40.888
Where are we
gonna find one of those?

27:40.970 --> 27:42.429
You guys got everything?
You got enough to drink?

27:42.512 --> 27:43.596
All right, gonna dig in.

27:43.679 --> 27:45.304
Oh, uh... yep.

27:45.387 --> 27:46.638
We say grace in this house.

27:46.721 --> 27:48.012
I don't really do that.

27:48.095 --> 27:49.179
Oh, well, you can
always try.

27:49.262 --> 27:50.721
