(CHIP SPEAKING)

00:27.033 --> 00:28.233
You don't know the channel,

00:28.467 --> 00:31.267
it's best to have a marker
to apply your eyes to,

00:31.333 --> 00:32.600
so you can range yourself.

00:35.067 --> 00:36.600
(CHIP SPEAKING)

01:05.633 --> 01:08.300
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
are returning to camp
from a hunting trip,

01:08.733 --> 01:11.300
but without a marker
to guide them along
the treacherous river,

01:11.500 --> 01:13.867
their path home is uncertain.

01:13.933 --> 01:15.633
(SQUAWKING)

01:16.533 --> 01:18.300
CHIP: This is it right here.

01:21.667 --> 01:22.833
You see how hard that was?

01:22.900 --> 01:25.533
This is just inches off
the surface of the water.

01:25.767 --> 01:28.567
You see how much trouble
that was trying to figure out
where we were?

01:28.800 --> 01:30.833
That's why I was kind of
fudging along here thinking,

01:30.900 --> 01:33.000
I'm gonna take it slow
till I know exactly
where I'm going.

01:33.067 --> 01:35.667
We were having trouble
out in the, um, lagoon,

01:35.733 --> 01:38.367
trying to find the, uh,
mouth to the river.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.633
CHIP:
We came in really well
over the sandbars.

01:40.700 --> 01:43.600
It's these real high tides
that took away the marker
that was here.

01:45.033 --> 01:48.100
Oh, it was wood that
was staked down in here
and it had jerry jugs,

01:48.167 --> 01:49.333
red jerry jugs
hanging on it,

01:49.400 --> 01:50.767
and you could
see it for miles.

01:51.133 --> 01:53.633
It's gonna be important
you know where the mouth
of this channel is.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.567
This point is receded
quite a bit.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.333
The old marker's fallen over.

01:57.733 --> 01:59.867
The absolute best thing
we can do for ourselves
and other people

01:59.933 --> 02:01.067
would probably be
to put a marker here.

02:01.700 --> 02:04.167
AGNES: Me and him
know how to get into
this river and this area

02:04.433 --> 02:06.367
without any landmarks
or anything.

02:06.467 --> 02:09.900
But for the kids to learn
and to be comfortable
with coming here,

02:09.967 --> 02:12.700
it's good for them
to have something
to aim for and say,

02:12.767 --> 02:14.133
"Hey, I know where I'm at."

02:16.900 --> 02:17.933
I wanna put a tower here.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.400
We can use a tower
for multiple uses.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.400
We can use it
for orientating ourselves
to come in,

02:21.467 --> 02:23.967
we can use it
to orientate ourselves
in the wintertime

02:24.033 --> 02:26.667
when it's snowing
or when we're travelling
and it's foggy.

02:26.733 --> 02:27.867
And we'll also be
able to get up in it

02:27.933 --> 02:29.567
and look over and see
if the ocean is rough,

02:29.633 --> 02:32.233
and maybe even see a seal
or two if they're popping up
around here.

02:32.300 --> 02:35.600
Shouldn't take too long
to dig and chop and tie
something together

02:35.667 --> 02:37.733
that'd be very, very useful
to everybody around here.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.800
SUE: Coming up
with new ideas,
improvisation,

02:45.867 --> 02:48.067
that's the nature of living
out here in Alaska.

02:49.233 --> 02:50.967
(PLANE ENGINE WHIRRING)

02:54.533 --> 02:58.100
So that's the, uh, plane
that takes my nephew,
Jesse, home.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.733
-All right.
-All right, Auntie.

02:59.933 --> 03:00.933
(SUE SPEAKING)

03:03.133 --> 03:05.833
-No problem, Auntie.
-You did an amazing,
amazing job.

03:06.433 --> 03:09.700
SUE: He's definitely
been a big boon,
a big asset this year.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.700
I could not have made it
through the season
without him.

03:14.667 --> 03:17.267
Time for me
to get back to work,
get ready for winter.

03:17.533 --> 03:18.800
It's coming.

03:19.233 --> 03:22.300
Nobody here to help me,
and that's just the way
the cookie crumbles.

03:24.967 --> 03:26.667
NARRATOR:
With her nephew,
Jesse, gone,

03:27.900 --> 03:29.633
Sue Aikens
must rely on herself

03:29.700 --> 03:32.000
to survive the long
winter months ahead.

03:32.533 --> 03:35.133
Preserving
her winter meat supply
is a priority.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.533
Time for Susie
to look for some parts.

03:42.633 --> 03:44.333
Making a smoker's
pretty simple.

03:44.567 --> 03:47.933
You got your source of heat,
which creates the smoke,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.500
you send it up
into the smoker.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.800
It's not gonna go there
like a dog.

03:51.867 --> 03:54.133
You gotta channel it
using pipe.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.200
Here you go.

03:57.633 --> 03:58.633
(GRUNTS)

04:01.133 --> 04:02.867
Might be able to use that.

04:02.933 --> 04:06.700
This bone yard
is pieces and parts

04:06.767 --> 04:08.200
that I've taken apart
and changed.

04:08.267 --> 04:10.700
And as I change and update
and upgrade camp,

04:11.733 --> 04:13.300
this kind of stuff is extra.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.367
There's another
little elbow or two.

04:19.267 --> 04:21.700
This goes up into my smoker.

04:21.767 --> 04:22.933
Yay, smoke comes in.

04:25.867 --> 04:27.800
I am happy
with my little parts,

04:28.800 --> 04:32.767
and, uh, time for me
to get 'em together
and carry 'em in.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.400
(CLANKING)

04:39.000 --> 04:42.467
ERIK: This is the life
that I've chosen to live,
and it's just what we do.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.500
Martha and I
have been really busy
the entire summer

04:55.567 --> 04:58.233
running our fishing lodge,
and we're here
right at the end.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.667
Our last client
left yesterday.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.100
We're leaving Iliamna
for Wiseman in a few days.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.133
NARRATOR:
Erik and Martha Salitan

05:05.200 --> 05:07.600
have spent the summer
at their lodge in Iliamna,

05:08.000 --> 05:09.933
taking advantage of
the area's resources

05:10.000 --> 05:12.167
to maintain
their subsistence lifestyle.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.300
With dark winter approaching,

05:14.667 --> 05:17.400
the couple has one last chance
at harvesting salmon

05:17.467 --> 05:19.000
before they return
to Wiseman.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.533
You know,
Martha and I eat
a lot of fish.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.067
It's a real nice break,
to break up
our red meat diet

05:24.133 --> 05:25.433
that we primarily
eat up there

05:25.500 --> 05:26.933
with moose and sheep
and caribou.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.400
And, uh,
we just wanted
to get out here,

05:29.467 --> 05:31.233
put up a few fish of our own,

05:31.300 --> 05:32.633
and be able
to take those fish
home to Wiseman

05:32.700 --> 05:33.700
for the winter.

05:35.833 --> 05:38.400
Because Erik and I rely
a lot on subsistence,

05:38.467 --> 05:42.767
it's, uh, very important
that we take advantage
of what's in season,

05:42.833 --> 05:44.533
so right now salmon
are in season.

05:45.300 --> 05:48.800
ERIK: So these fish here
in the Iliamna drainage
are sockeye salmon

05:48.867 --> 05:50.267
that are locally
known as reds,

05:50.333 --> 05:52.300
one of the best
eating fish on earth.

05:52.367 --> 05:54.233
ERIK: I'm looking forward
to getting home to Wiseman.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.833
MARTHA: Yeah, me too.

05:56.367 --> 05:58.100
I'd like to put away
some salmon, though.

06:03.533 --> 06:05.067
MARTHA: Fish on!
ERIK: Fish on?

06:09.700 --> 06:10.800
MARTHA: It's foul-hooked.

06:11.733 --> 06:13.400
For salmon, you gotta
catch 'em in the mouth,

06:13.467 --> 06:15.167
you're not allowed
to keep 'em
unless you do,

06:15.233 --> 06:16.667
so when
you hook 'em
onto the fin,

06:16.733 --> 06:18.667
or anywhere else
on the body
besides the mouth,

06:18.733 --> 06:23.500
you have to let 'em go
'cause it's called a foul hook
and that's sports fishing.

06:23.567 --> 06:25.700
Well, let's head downriver
below the rapids.

06:25.767 --> 06:26.800
I think the fish are better.

06:26.867 --> 06:28.400
Even that one was
a little reddish,

06:28.467 --> 06:29.667
it's kind of turning.

06:30.133 --> 06:32.500
I think the fish
below the rapids are
far less beat up.

06:32.567 --> 06:33.633
Let me fish a couple more.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.100
Oh, you wanna fish more.
Okay.

06:39.033 --> 06:40.200
Girl loves to fish.

06:41.400 --> 06:45.167
MARTHA: The water coming
down the river right now
is all silty and glaciery,

06:45.267 --> 06:48.367
and it comes into
this little creek right here

06:48.433 --> 06:53.300
and then you can't see
the fish any more,
because it's all murky.

06:53.367 --> 06:55.867
Not to mention
that the rain makes it
hard to see,

06:55.933 --> 06:58.000
'cause it disturbs
the surface of the water.

06:58.700 --> 07:02.033
I told Martha,
like, 10 minutes ago,
like, let's go,

07:02.100 --> 07:05.333
and she agreed,
and she's still
over there fishing.

07:05.733 --> 07:07.433
The girl is obsessed
with fishing.

07:08.133 --> 07:10.500
Push the boat off here
and pick Martha up,

07:10.567 --> 07:12.367
since she refuses
to quit ever,

07:12.633 --> 07:15.267
and see if we can't
get on the fish
a little bit better.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.433
How am I supposed to get in?

07:24.167 --> 07:25.300
-Like that?
-Yeah.

07:32.567 --> 07:35.167
JESSIE: Any time
I get a chance to, like,
get out, go camping,

07:35.233 --> 07:36.567
and go hunting
and fishing,

07:36.633 --> 07:38.000
that's just, like,
everything to me.

07:38.067 --> 07:39.300
That's why I live up here.

07:42.433 --> 07:44.433
(DOGS BARKING)

07:49.433 --> 07:52.033
Well, I'm going up
into what I call
Bigfoot Country.

07:52.767 --> 07:55.300
I'm about to travel
100 to 110 miles

07:55.367 --> 07:57.500
through three to four
different rivers,

07:57.567 --> 08:01.400
just to kind of
get more in touch with
the country out there.

08:01.467 --> 08:02.567
That's the whole
purpose of this trip,

08:02.633 --> 08:05.200
is, uh, to go out here
in this time of year

08:05.267 --> 08:06.867
before moose hunting season

08:06.933 --> 08:09.033
and just kind of check
the country out and
get to know it better.

(ENGINE STARTS)

08:13.033 --> 08:15.333
NARRATOR:
Jessie Holmes is journeying
deep into the wilderness

08:15.400 --> 08:16.800
to scout for resources.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.100
Finding an area
to fish and hunt
for the fall season

08:20.167 --> 08:23.867
is crucial to feeding
himself and his sled dogs
through the winter.

08:25.267 --> 08:26.933
JESSIE: All right.
Daylight's burning.

08:33.233 --> 08:36.267
It's pretty important
to, like, be familiar with
the land around you.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.600
I don't really rely on
compasses or maps,

08:38.667 --> 08:42.400
so this is just all a part
of developing my intimacy
with the land out there.

08:43.267 --> 08:45.000
I feel like I'm going on
a great adventure,

08:45.067 --> 08:46.733
I feel like
I'm Jeremiah Johnson.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.133
But I ain't.
I'm Jessie Holmes,
the River Man.

09:07.233 --> 09:09.533
Well, I think this is
Ding Mac Puck's Slough.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.733
But I'm also thinking
this still might be
on the Tanana River.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.300
I'm just trying to sense
where I go as I go.

09:16.367 --> 09:18.700
I don't necessarily know
exactly where I'm at.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.067
I just know I'm on the river.

09:21.733 --> 09:24.333
We might still be on
the channel of the Tanana
and, like,

09:24.400 --> 09:26.433
Ding Mac Puck might be
up here around the bend.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.433
Only been here one time, so,

09:30.167 --> 09:32.067
I just kind of
gotta pay attention,
you know,

09:32.133 --> 09:34.467
it's really actually difficult
to navigate out here.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.633
It's what I call
a critical point
of the journey,

09:36.700 --> 09:38.233
knowing where
the hell you're going.

09:41.233 --> 09:42.800
Gotta make sure
about these things, man,

09:42.867 --> 09:45.233
you don't wanna spend
a bunch of gas going
in the wrong direction.

09:45.300 --> 09:47.467
I don't have a GPS,
I don't have a map.

09:50.167 --> 09:51.267
Find out one way.

09:54.733 --> 09:58.000
You have to
always constantly be aware of
the water and what it's doing.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.533
It's full of, like,
sandbars, logs.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.767
The river's been
dropping a lot lately.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.700
We're gonna be dealing
with shallow water.

10:17.633 --> 10:18.667
It's okay, fella.

10:18.733 --> 10:19.733
We're not bothering you,

10:19.800 --> 10:20.800
we're just trying
to get by you.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.700
Pretty shallow.
Hope we make it through here,

10:28.767 --> 10:30.100
'cause we already
came a long way.

10:30.167 --> 10:31.567
I don't wanna
turn back around.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.100
(ENGINE STARTS)

10:57.400 --> 10:58.433
Think I'm lost.

11:02.267 --> 11:04.267
Took a wrong turn
quite a ways back there,

11:04.333 --> 11:06.700
and I'm tired
of trying to battle up
this shallow water.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.233
I don't think I'm going
the right way.

11:09.433 --> 11:11.000
I've never even
been this way before,

11:11.067 --> 11:12.833
so looks like
I made a mistake,

11:12.900 --> 11:14.833
and now I'm gonna have
to turn around and go back.

11:17.567 --> 11:19.033
This isn't good.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.633
I'm gonna have to lose
a lot of time and gas
because of this.

11:21.700 --> 11:25.100
This is disorienting country,
you know, it's easy
to get lost out here.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.267
I have to make sure I have
enough gas to make it back.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.133
If I make another
big mistake like that,

11:31.200 --> 11:33.100
then I'm gonna have
to cut my trip short.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.200
It's frustrating
to go the wrong way,

11:35.267 --> 11:37.733
but these are just the kind of
things you deal with out here.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.700
When I come out here,
I'm out here by myself.

11:47.533 --> 11:49.467
I got my life in my own hands,

11:49.533 --> 11:51.600
because I'm way out
in the middle of nowhere.

11:52.033 --> 11:53.733
This is a place that makes
some people worry.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.967
This is a place that
makes me feel comfortable.

11:59.867 --> 12:01.000
That's a nice looking moose,

12:01.067 --> 12:03.167
so I guess I'm out in
the right country now.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.833
I love coming out here
and seeing animals,

12:05.900 --> 12:07.300
you know,
that's a good thing.

12:07.967 --> 12:10.133
That's what I'm looking for,
is animal country.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.033
It's getting late.

12:21.100 --> 12:24.533
Been travelling long today,
been about 10 hours,
11 hours on the river.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.133
So, I'm gonna
check this out

12:26.200 --> 12:27.667
for setting up camp
for the night.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.533
This looks like
a good enough spot
to camp to me.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.233
It's got the most
important essentials,

12:36.300 --> 12:38.567
easy to get up the bank,
it's got firewood.

12:39.733 --> 12:41.833
Tobias!
We're gonna camp here, buddy.

12:44.700 --> 12:47.433
The main thing I wanna do
right now is have a fire

12:47.900 --> 12:49.833
and relax and eat
and enjoy it.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.900
I personally would've
liked something
a little more scenic,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.800
but, you know,
you take what you can get.

12:58.900 --> 12:59.933
You like it here?

13:00.500 --> 13:01.833
You keep an eye out,
all right?

13:09.433 --> 13:11.567
Tobias, he's, uh,
pretty much retired.

13:11.633 --> 13:15.433
I've had him for 10 years
and he's done his duty,
he's won dog races.

13:15.500 --> 13:19.033
There ain't many dogs
in my kennel that can say
that they won a dog race.

13:21.800 --> 13:26.067
He's a critical leader for me
for many years
of getting started in mushing.

13:26.933 --> 13:30.867
'Course I'm gonna give
the oldest, best dog in
my kennel the respect

13:31.600 --> 13:33.533
and retirement
that he deserves.

13:39.267 --> 13:40.900
Spend some time
fishing tomorrow,

13:40.967 --> 13:43.167
and spend some time
exploring around also.

13:43.233 --> 13:44.667
See what I can't rustle up.

13:45.767 --> 13:48.000
It's just the excitement of
a new day out in the woods.

13:48.067 --> 13:49.800
Nothing's
a guarantee
out here.

13:51.067 --> 13:52.900
But I can guarantee you,

13:52.967 --> 13:54.233
if you're not willing
to work for it,

13:54.300 --> 13:55.400
you ain't gonna get nothing.

13:59.533 --> 14:01.833
Here you go, buddy.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.100
Good boy.
Sure glad you came with me.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.933
SUE: The biggest trait
you have to know

14:12.000 --> 14:15.567
is curiosity, ingenuity,
imagination.

14:18.967 --> 14:20.700
(SQUAWKING)

14:25.467 --> 14:26.467
(GRUNTS)

14:27.800 --> 14:29.767
I love projects.

14:32.267 --> 14:35.633
NARRATOR: In order
to preserve and flavour
her winter caribou meat,

14:35.933 --> 14:39.067
Sue is building a smoker
using salvaged materials.

14:39.500 --> 14:43.100
Preserving the meat
is critical to her survival in
the coming winter months.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.700
I get a little table.

14:48.067 --> 14:51.167
I can put these things on it,
utilise it when I'm done,

14:51.233 --> 14:53.633
clean it up, store it,
use it again next year.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Or try to make it,
it fails miserably,

14:57.067 --> 14:59.467
I grab a brewski,
laugh about it,

14:59.533 --> 15:01.200
and think of how I can
do it better next year.

15:02.633 --> 15:05.367
I don't have really
the right tools for the job,

15:05.433 --> 15:06.833
I don't have a hole saw.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.100
I have a drill bit.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.700
(WHIRRING)

15:16.600 --> 15:19.900
I drill the little holes and
then kind of play connect
the dot with my jigsaw.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.333
(WHIRRING CONTINUES)

15:25.900 --> 15:28.367
In a perfect world,
I'd maybe put it through
the bottom,

15:29.433 --> 15:32.400
but I just need
to inundate it,
it's a cold smoker.

15:32.467 --> 15:33.533
I'm not trying to cook it.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.433
I just wanna inundate it
with the smoke.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.767
Doing the cold smoking,
it's a flavour thing,

15:41.833 --> 15:44.767
and to make it unattractive
for pests and bugs.

15:44.833 --> 15:47.500
I'm not trying to cook it.
I'm trying to imbue a flavour.

15:53.733 --> 15:54.733
All righty.

15:54.967 --> 15:57.000
(PANTING)

16:01.867 --> 16:02.867
Now...

16:08.367 --> 16:09.733
This is my little stove.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.700
I use him for when
I'm going camping
in the winter.

16:12.633 --> 16:15.367
But he can have other uses.

16:21.233 --> 16:24.400
This is where
you kind of start playing
jigsaw pieces.

16:27.533 --> 16:28.533
Okay.

16:32.133 --> 16:33.300
Come on.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.733
You know you want to.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.700
Susie loves you.

16:40.900 --> 16:41.900
Come on!

16:44.200 --> 16:45.233
Nice.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.300
Okay.

16:48.367 --> 16:49.467
I'm gonna get
something in there

16:49.533 --> 16:50.567
and get it starting
to smoke.

16:50.633 --> 16:51.900
We'll see if it's gonna work.

16:55.067 --> 16:57.233
This is, uh, some meat
that got donated to me.

16:57.300 --> 17:00.733
It's here, it's fresh,
and I can get it right
in the smoker.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.867
Bam, bam.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.533
Just gonna
set that one inside,
go get another one.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.700
(FIRE CRACKLING)

17:21.433 --> 17:22.567
It is smoking.

17:23.033 --> 17:25.000
I had meat donated to me,

17:25.067 --> 17:28.867
and I did my little idea,
and funky as it is,
it seems to be working.

17:29.767 --> 17:31.400
Life is good in
the Kavik hood.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.333
CHIP:
Every year is different.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.500
Every time
I come down here

17:40.567 --> 17:41.733
there's something
different going on.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.133
This place surprises
me all the time,

17:43.200 --> 17:44.433
and I kind of look
forward to that.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.700
Tinmiaq? Carol?

17:56.367 --> 17:58.333
You two
got yourselves
squared away?

17:58.400 --> 18:00.567
-Ting, you got a rifle?
-Yeah.

18:00.633 --> 18:04.067
Today, we're going to go
put up a post marker

18:04.133 --> 18:06.600
at the mouth
of the river,

18:06.667 --> 18:07.900
so that we can
know where to go in

18:07.967 --> 18:09.233
when we're coming
through the channel.

18:12.867 --> 18:15.033
CHIP: I see a lot
of things that happen
to kids around here,

18:15.100 --> 18:16.867
is they get diverted.

18:16.933 --> 18:19.233
It's easier for them
to sit and play games
than it is to go cut fish.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.633
I want my kids to know
how to go up to a place
to get what they need.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.533
You know, you gotta eat.
You gotta be heated.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.800
You need shelter and clothing.

18:25.867 --> 18:27.500
And they can do it all
by getting these things.

18:27.567 --> 18:29.667
They can make money
to buy the things that
they can't get.

18:31.167 --> 18:32.167
Seal, seal!

18:33.633 --> 18:35.000
Right there on
the fucking grass!

(AGNES SPEAKING)

18:51.733 --> 18:52.767
You want to get closer?

18:53.533 --> 18:54.533
Go get closer.

18:54.900 --> 18:55.900
Go get closer.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.867
(AGNES SPEAKING)

19:06.367 --> 19:08.067
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

19:09.467 --> 19:10.633
(LAUGHS)

19:10.700 --> 19:12.333
Right over here was
a small ugruk check.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.633
And, uh,
my daughters jumped out
and decided to hunt it.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.467
Carol took a shot, missed it.

19:16.967 --> 19:18.333
No ugruk check.
(CHUCKLES)

19:18.400 --> 19:19.900
You know, right now,
we're gonna go get some wood.

19:36.033 --> 19:37.667
See, look,
really junky up here.

19:38.100 --> 19:40.267
Why don't you girls
spot us out some poles?

19:40.833 --> 19:42.300
We'll be digging down
a couple feet,

19:42.600 --> 19:44.733
and then we're gonna want them
up about six feet above us.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.400
Add about four feet to that.

19:46.467 --> 19:49.600
So, I would say probably
14, 15-foot-long poles.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.633
They can be a bit larger,
but we have to be able
to carry them.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.400
If you wanna just go
spot a few of those out,

19:53.467 --> 19:54.967
I'm gonna sharpen the saw

19:56.333 --> 19:57.800
and get things running
from this end.

19:57.867 --> 19:59.233
I would go
a bit further,
Ting.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.800
TINMIAQ: Okay.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.100
Go a bit further down there,
probably about 200 yards,
and start looking.

20:04.167 --> 20:07.267
It doesn't have to be that
tall to be a good marker here
because it's so flat.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.700
And whether
you're on the water

20:09.533 --> 20:11.667
at sea level
looking along here,

20:11.733 --> 20:13.833
or you're, um,
on a snow machine,

20:13.900 --> 20:16.733
which is at sea level
on top of the frozen water,

20:17.000 --> 20:18.567
it's good to have
a marker around here.

20:18.633 --> 20:19.767
TINMIAQ: Holy crud.

20:20.433 --> 20:21.567
Holy moly.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.133
Magic poles, Carol.

20:28.167 --> 20:29.167
Right there.

20:30.933 --> 20:32.300
All righty.

20:32.367 --> 20:33.567
CHIP:
When we're down here
it's like shopping, man.

20:33.633 --> 20:34.967
We just get
the resources
we need.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.400
We need heat.
There it is.

20:37.467 --> 20:39.367
We need building material.
There it is.

20:39.433 --> 20:41.000
We just skip
the money part
entirely.

20:41.933 --> 20:42.967
Right here, Carol.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.300
One, two, three!

20:55.233 --> 20:57.333
CHIP: I'm gonna cut
this pole right here.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.233
We have to get our wood
and stuff into the boat before
the tide changes,

21:00.300 --> 21:01.967
before it goes down,
so we can pull it out of here,

21:02.033 --> 21:06.400
'cause this is about
a quarter mile of, uh,
extremely shallow water.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.267
CHIP: We gotta
get out of here,

21:27.333 --> 21:28.967
'cause the tide's
just starting to turn.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.433
Got your jackets?

21:34.300 --> 21:36.033
So, I think we're timing
this out just right.

ERIK:
I came to Alaska
as a teenager.

21:43.667 --> 21:46.800
I was in search of
a sense of adventure,
and I guess I found it.

21:55.167 --> 21:56.933
NARRATOR:
Erik and Martha are
travelling upriver

21:57.000 --> 21:58.533
to fish for salmon.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.500
It's their last chance
to harvest fish
for meat and protein

22:01.567 --> 22:04.367
before they return to Wiseman
for dark winter.

22:04.433 --> 22:06.133
MARTHA: It's swift
out there right now.

22:06.533 --> 22:10.000
I've been fishing
at the same spot
since I can remember.

22:10.333 --> 22:13.600
Coming here for 24 years.

22:13.867 --> 22:16.000
I have a lot of good
memories over here.

22:16.067 --> 22:18.533
Fish come by this one rock
every single year,

22:18.600 --> 22:21.300
and it's the greatest
fishing spot for red salmon.

22:21.867 --> 22:22.933
Wow!

22:25.200 --> 22:26.467
There's a lot of fish.

22:27.233 --> 22:29.333
I still feel like a little kid
when I come out here.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.400
Of course you go
to the best spot.

22:32.267 --> 22:35.100
I love my wife,
but she's a game
and a fish hog.

22:40.167 --> 22:42.200
Look how
net-rashed
that one is.

22:45.133 --> 22:46.400
Yeah, the fish are just...

22:46.900 --> 22:49.167
Different days they run up
in different ways.

22:49.233 --> 22:50.833
We're foul-hooking
a bunch of them.

22:51.567 --> 22:53.400
It's one of those
kind of fisheries you...

22:53.867 --> 22:55.967
You can fish
all over the world
and be a great angler,

22:56.033 --> 22:58.500
and then you come up here
to Alaska and try this,

22:58.867 --> 23:00.200
and you gotta get dialled in.

23:00.900 --> 23:02.433
Haven't got dialled in yet,

23:02.500 --> 23:05.800
but once we get dialled,
we'll punch 'em out
pretty quick.

23:05.867 --> 23:07.533
MARTHA: Oh,
that was in the mouth!

23:07.600 --> 23:08.600
ERIK: Was it?

23:11.900 --> 23:15.233
That's the first salmon
of the day that we've caught
legally in the mouth.

23:15.567 --> 23:18.033
This is some really good,
good fresh meat.

23:18.400 --> 23:22.833
Meat like this sells
for $19.99 in supermarkets
across America.

23:23.867 --> 23:26.333
Found free,
here in the wilds of Alaska.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.500
Can't let 'em get
over the waterfall,

23:28.567 --> 23:30.500
if they get over
the waterfall,
you're done.

23:37.233 --> 23:39.700
If you don't use a net
while you're fishing
these salmon

23:39.767 --> 23:40.833
you lose a lot of 'em,

23:40.933 --> 23:42.733
so you gotta have control,

23:42.800 --> 23:44.933
even though
you see all the fish
in the water there.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.867
You just get the net ready
'cause it happens quick.

23:51.900 --> 23:52.900
Hey!

23:54.967 --> 23:56.033
ERIK: Now?
MARTHA: Yep.

24:02.833 --> 24:03.933
Nice job, honey.

24:04.333 --> 24:05.533
Keep it off the rocks.

24:08.033 --> 24:09.067
Nice!

24:09.700 --> 24:10.800
All right.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.100
We got the limit.

24:12.167 --> 24:14.767
So, this is the last fish
of our limit today.

24:17.133 --> 24:19.000
Martha and I had
the goal to put up

24:19.067 --> 24:21.300
a couple hundred pounds
of salmon for the winter.

24:21.633 --> 24:23.500
Got our last 10
in the Rubbermaid.

24:23.567 --> 24:25.633
We're gonna go home,
set 'em up, clean 'em.

24:26.700 --> 24:29.500
-Ship these fish to Wiseman.
-And have fish head soup.

24:29.567 --> 24:31.467
And definitely have
fish head soup tonight.

24:31.533 --> 24:32.533
I'm so hungry.

24:33.533 --> 24:34.700
Let's rock and roll, babe.

JESSIE: There's no way
a guy couldn't get by out here
if he wasn't determined to.

NARRATOR: To scout
for resources to survive
the coming winter,

24:56.167 --> 25:00.200
Jessie has journeyed more
than 100 miles from his home
into unknown wilderness.

25:02.267 --> 25:03.833
JESSIE:
Travelled a long way
to get here.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.200
First thing I'm gonna do
is start fishing right now.

25:06.267 --> 25:07.633
Then I'm gonna
be heading up,

25:08.133 --> 25:10.600
further up the river,
this evening.

25:11.167 --> 25:12.467
Deeper into the wilderness.

25:13.267 --> 25:15.400
Testing spots out
as I go along the way.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.533
For me this is just exploring
and broadening my range,

25:20.600 --> 25:23.500
you know, like, getting
a greater understanding
of the country.

25:24.467 --> 25:27.733
At this point in my life,
I wanna spend a lot of time
out in places like this.

25:28.867 --> 25:31.067
Make it to where
I can live better out here.

25:32.733 --> 25:34.700
I ain't seen a fish jump
since I've been here.

25:51.833 --> 25:53.200
All right.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.833
Come on, buddy.
Man, there that sucker goes.

25:57.900 --> 25:58.933
He's fighting now.

25:59.633 --> 26:00.900
Gotta wear him down
a little bit,

26:00.967 --> 26:02.033
where you can get him in.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Yeah.
Pretty good-sized one.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.267
Oh, yeah.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.000
That is a beautiful fish
right there.

26:14.233 --> 26:15.700
Son of a bitch!

26:19.400 --> 26:21.700
You've got to be kidding me.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.100
That was a huge fish!

26:24.767 --> 26:26.867
Yeah, I lost him.
Line snapped.

26:27.833 --> 26:28.833
Fish over.

26:30.300 --> 26:31.767
I saw another pike in there.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.233
It's a nice-looking
fish right there.

26:43.433 --> 26:46.167
Fish are feeding
at a certain time of day
and coming in and out.

26:46.233 --> 26:47.400
Sometimes
they're up in the lake,

26:47.467 --> 26:48.700
sometimes they're
down in the river.

26:48.767 --> 26:50.700
So, timing's everything here.

26:53.533 --> 26:55.333
We're in freaking
pike country.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.633
Yes!

26:58.700 --> 27:00.733
I saw that guy
jump out there
and I cast it.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.200
Got it!

27:02.267 --> 27:04.933
That's definitely
our biggest catch
so far out here.

27:05.167 --> 27:07.967
Yeah, look at that guy.
Great fishing out here.

27:08.167 --> 27:09.200
One more.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.333
Got him.

27:15.967 --> 27:16.967
There it is.

27:17.833 --> 27:20.300
You know, that's when
you're really getting ahead
in life up here.

27:20.367 --> 27:22.567
When you're
putting fish away
for the winter,

27:22.633 --> 27:24.067
when it's hard to catch fish.

27:26.867 --> 27:29.467
It's taking advantage of
this resource while it's here.

27:29.533 --> 27:31.633
A lot of people don't want to
work that hard for their food,

27:31.700 --> 27:34.100
but I don't want to do it
any other way.

27:34.400 --> 27:37.833
Main goal in life
is to be able to make
a life off the land

27:37.900 --> 27:40.100
and put food
that's wholesome
in your freezer.

27:40.333 --> 27:42.800
It takes a lot of resources
to be able to live like this.

27:43.067 --> 27:45.067
Takes a lot of time
and knowledge.

27:45.500 --> 27:48.100
Some people
like to do it with less,
I'm not that way.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.733
I want to do it right.

27:49.933 --> 27:52.367
Couldn't do this
if I hadn't worked at years
at getting prepared,

27:52.433 --> 27:54.433
got my own boat,
and my own motors,

27:54.500 --> 27:55.867
and my own everything.

27:56.833 --> 27:58.233
I earned every bit of this.

28:01.167 --> 28:02.933
Now it's time
to get camp set up

28:03.000 --> 28:04.833
and get fed
and get to bed.

28:04.967 --> 28:06.367
Rest up for the next day.

28:06.533 --> 28:07.533
(CLICKS TONGUE)

28:08.233 --> 28:12.067
We're out here
in some serious
wild country now.

28:12.133 --> 28:15.067
Travelled deep
into the wilderness over
the last couple days.

28:17.267 --> 28:19.367
I don't want to go around
out here without a gun.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.067
So, I'm looking forward
to getting further
into the wilderness

28:24.133 --> 28:25.400
and setting up camp tonight.

28:26.133 --> 28:27.667
You never know what's
gonna happen out here.

28:27.733 --> 28:29.700
Just got to put yourself
in the right situation.

28:34.900 --> 28:36.867
CHIP:
We get to teach our kids
how to live this way.

28:36.933 --> 28:38.733
We make 'em comfortable
and we make it acceptable.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.233
It's acceptable
to live in a tent.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.700
Well, at least the sky
is getting sunny.

28:48.767 --> 28:50.200
NARRATOR:
For the Hailstones,

28:50.267 --> 28:52.233
building a tower marker
will help them navigate

28:52.300 --> 28:54.633
the dangerous waters
of the Kiwalik River.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.167
CHIP:
I came down here
to take this wood.

28:57.233 --> 28:59.433
Dig some holes.
Chainsaw some wood.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.633
Tie some ropes together
and get her done.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.667
Yeah,
if you want to start
digging these holes,

29:03.733 --> 29:04.967
I was gonna show you
where I want 'em put.

29:05.033 --> 29:06.767
I want 'em put
in these different places.

29:06.833 --> 29:08.167
They gotta be oblong, too.

29:08.233 --> 29:09.267
They can't be
just perfectly round,

29:09.333 --> 29:10.833
you're gonna have
to make them oblong,

29:10.933 --> 29:12.367
'cause we're gonna put
two posts side-by-side.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.067
(CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

29:21.233 --> 29:22.500
We're getting the poles ready.

29:23.700 --> 29:25.067
If you go get the rope, yep.

29:25.133 --> 29:27.467
This is where
the platform part
to the top of it

29:27.533 --> 29:28.567
is gonna be placed,

29:28.867 --> 29:30.633
to hold it together
and give it some integrity.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.233
These didn't cost us much,
time, wood.

29:33.900 --> 29:35.967
Doesn't cost us much
to do these kind of things.

29:36.033 --> 29:37.433
This'll probably stand
for a few years,

29:37.500 --> 29:38.700
or at least
I would hope it would.

29:41.100 --> 29:44.400
We'll, uh, tamp it down
and put some crosspieces
up here.

29:47.033 --> 29:50.400
What this will do is probably
give me a good orientation
when I'm coming in here.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.967
Especially
when the tide is high

29:52.033 --> 29:53.500
and I can't really see
the land very well,

29:53.567 --> 29:54.900
I'll know right where
the mouth is.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.200
You know, we could put
a platform up here

30:05.267 --> 30:08.300
and the kids could sit up top,
and scout the place out,
get them a spotting scope.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.367
Maybe make a fire pit.

30:10.433 --> 30:11.700
Eat a little bit of lunch.

30:12.900 --> 30:14.400
I'm pretty happy
with this today.

30:17.467 --> 30:20.533
SUE: Life is just a series
of events you overcome.

30:20.900 --> 30:21.900
And succeed.

30:35.467 --> 30:36.800
(GASPS) Look at that!

30:37.333 --> 30:40.033
It's meat and it's not cooked,
you know?

30:40.100 --> 30:41.100
It's just smoked.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.167
Just gonna cut a little hunk.

30:49.100 --> 30:50.867
Spent quite a bit
of time there.

30:51.333 --> 30:54.300
And you have the smoke
look and flavour,

30:54.867 --> 30:57.033
but you can see it is
not the hot smoke

30:57.100 --> 30:59.567
where you're physically
cooking the meat.

30:59.633 --> 31:02.233
You're just flavouring
and keeping the bugs off it.

31:02.633 --> 31:04.300
So, let's go see
how yummy it is.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.567
Hmm.
Smells pretty tasty.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.467
(SIGHS)

31:12.833 --> 31:13.833
Doink.

31:14.100 --> 31:17.267
Bon appetit,
as Miss Child would say.

31:21.867 --> 31:23.067
That's pretty tasty.

31:25.533 --> 31:26.867
The season is done.

31:26.933 --> 31:28.667
It's been a tumultuous year.

31:29.900 --> 31:31.900
The injuries
I sustained last winter

31:31.967 --> 31:35.967
were just the injuries
that didn't want to let go and
just let me get on with life.

31:38.833 --> 31:41.267
You know, the injury
cost me some time

31:41.333 --> 31:43.233
and a little bit
of body parts.

31:43.633 --> 31:45.867
But, financially,
it's ruinous.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.967
Three or four weeks
of my busiest time of year

31:49.500 --> 31:50.567
had that much revenue.

31:51.133 --> 31:53.733
Nobody was here
to run the gens to keep
the food frozen.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.033
It all went bad.

31:55.100 --> 31:57.800
I lost all the food,
I lost all the appliances.

31:58.667 --> 32:02.033
You never get to pick and plan
when things break down.

32:02.100 --> 32:04.633
You pick and choose
how you react to that.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.967
And how do I always react?

32:07.033 --> 32:08.433
I jump right back
in the saddle

32:08.500 --> 32:09.633
and kick it
into high gear.

32:09.700 --> 32:11.067
That's just who I am.

32:12.333 --> 32:15.767
One last thing to do,
and then I'm done for the day.

32:20.967 --> 32:22.000
I'm back.

32:24.133 --> 32:27.400
Haven't seen
this little rat bastard
since I got hurt.

32:32.700 --> 32:33.700
(SIGHS)

32:34.200 --> 32:35.200
So...

32:38.700 --> 32:41.267
Say hello
to my little friend,
Susie's back.

32:42.233 --> 32:43.533
This is for my shoulder.

32:44.733 --> 32:46.100
This is just because.

32:47.167 --> 32:51.367
It turned out not to be
such a good fucking tool!

32:51.433 --> 32:53.100
It's a piece of machinery.

32:53.167 --> 32:54.933
It didn't have
any evil intent.

32:55.067 --> 32:56.533
But I tell you what,

32:57.300 --> 32:59.400
sometimes swinging
that frying pan

32:59.467 --> 33:01.267
and making contact
feels good.

33:02.100 --> 33:04.300
I'm not somebody
who gives up easily.

33:04.600 --> 33:09.933
I am not somebody
who finds it a strength
to say I need help.

33:10.167 --> 33:12.700
It's just been
the course of my life that,

33:12.767 --> 33:14.833
"So you can't get it done?
Draw a little deeper.

33:14.900 --> 33:16.833
"Dig a little harder.
Learn a little bit more."

33:17.167 --> 33:22.033
This injury taught me fear,
respect, some new limits.

33:23.133 --> 33:24.500
Whoops!

33:34.900 --> 33:36.300
Been waiting months
to do that.

33:37.367 --> 33:38.367
(CHUCKLES)

33:38.800 --> 33:40.100
Hurt me, will ya?

33:40.600 --> 33:42.200
I'm back, motherfucker.

33:44.233 --> 33:46.000
It's time to back
this bad boy up,

33:46.933 --> 33:48.500
and get him out of
my shop for good.

33:49.067 --> 33:50.867
I don't like seeing
the little rat bastard,

33:50.933 --> 33:53.500
but, you know,
I almost kind of want to make
a shrine out of it

33:53.567 --> 33:56.567
because
this one taught me something
I obviously needed to learn,

33:56.633 --> 33:57.867
a little bit of fear
and respect.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.133
And I'll never forget it
'cause I'm forever changed.

34:07.367 --> 34:09.000
ERIK: Life is good.
Life is busy.

34:09.067 --> 34:10.933
I like to get out and just
get my hands dirty.

34:22.533 --> 34:24.567
NARRATOR: After catching
their limit of salmon,

34:24.633 --> 34:27.200
Erik and Martha begin
to process the fish

34:27.267 --> 34:29.833
so they can be shipped to
their winter home in Wiseman.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.567
Let's get this
done and eat.

34:32.033 --> 34:35.433
Even though we use
the salmon to sell
and bring guests in,

34:35.900 --> 34:37.333
we also love to eat salmon.

34:38.533 --> 34:40.800
There's not
a whole lot of salmon
up in Wiseman.

34:41.200 --> 34:44.667
So every year,
when we leave Iliamna for that
at the end of the summer,

34:44.733 --> 34:46.833
we make sure that we bring
a couple hundred pounds
with us.

34:47.467 --> 34:50.933
You won't find
a filet much fresher than that
in your local supermarket.

34:51.433 --> 34:53.700
Every time Martha and I
go into a grocery store

34:53.767 --> 34:56.967
and we see
a sockeye salmon,
$19.99 a pound,

34:57.033 --> 34:58.167
and we laugh and we look.

34:58.233 --> 34:59.500
And we look at
one fish in there

34:59.567 --> 35:01.400
and think about
how that's $100,

35:01.933 --> 35:04.767
and we say,
"Man, just all you got
to do is go in the boat

35:04.833 --> 35:06.833
"and putt along a few minutes

35:06.900 --> 35:10.567
"and you're gonna come out
with several thousand dollars
in fish."

35:13.833 --> 35:16.100
We got these fish
all cleaned up, filleted,

35:16.167 --> 35:18.533
and now we're gonna go ahead
and vacuum seal these fillets

35:18.600 --> 35:20.500
and get them ready
to ship up to Wiseman.

35:21.233 --> 35:22.233
MARTHA: Oh, boy.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.767
What are we at
for poundage right now?

35:31.033 --> 35:32.467
ERIK: 50-pound mark.

35:32.533 --> 35:34.167
Last two.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.933
All right, where's that?
Can you grab that Sharpie?

35:37.000 --> 35:38.333
MARTHA: Sure.
Let me turn this off.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.867
Even though
we're leaving Iliamna,

35:39.933 --> 35:41.900
we're taking
a little bit of it with us,

35:41.967 --> 35:45.567
which is, uh, the red salmon
that we're vacuum sealing here
and bringing with us.

35:45.633 --> 35:48.333
So, in a couple months when
we're kind of missing Iliamna,

35:48.400 --> 35:51.433
we'll be able to break out
some of that salmon
and, uh, enjoy it again.

35:51.933 --> 35:53.667
ERIK: All right.
We're ready to roll, I think.

35:54.067 --> 35:56.600
Let's go ship this out.
Let's ship it to Wiseman
and, uh,

35:57.667 --> 36:00.000
go back to the lodge,
start breaking things down

36:00.067 --> 36:01.367
and close it up
for the season.

36:01.833 --> 36:03.100
I got the fish,
you got the door?

36:03.167 --> 36:04.233
Yep.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.133
JESSIE: You can't get a feel
for the country you're in

36:11.200 --> 36:12.633
unless you're willing
to get out in it.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.833
NARRATOR: Jessie
is scouting a remote location
for signs of resources.

36:29.267 --> 36:31.933
Locating areas that he can
hunt and fish in the future

36:32.233 --> 36:34.933
is critical to surviving
the harsh winter ahead.

36:35.533 --> 36:37.200
JESSIE: Worn down
moose holes here.

36:38.567 --> 36:40.333
This is where one's
bedded down at,

36:40.400 --> 36:41.900
all the grass is laid down.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.200
There's moose tracks
all over the place.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.733
By the looks
of this track here,

36:47.800 --> 36:49.633
I'd say it's
a really new track.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.633
A day or two at the most.

36:52.300 --> 36:54.200
Looking out for a good
moose hunting spot,

36:54.267 --> 36:56.900
that's one of the main
things I'm looking for,
is right here.

36:56.967 --> 36:58.167
A sign that they're here.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.400
A fresh sign.

37:00.867 --> 37:02.133
This is moose scat.

37:02.367 --> 37:04.133
Pretty happy with what
I'm seeing around here.

37:04.200 --> 37:06.467
That's why it's so important
for me to get out here

37:06.800 --> 37:08.700
and go walk all
of these areas.

37:09.700 --> 37:11.100
I might be trampling
through the brush

37:11.167 --> 37:13.500
and that seems, like, hard,
but to me that's just fun.

37:13.567 --> 37:15.633
I don't want to, like,
come out here
and blindly hunt,

37:15.700 --> 37:17.800
I want to come out here and
feel like this is my camp.

37:26.133 --> 37:28.267
The work is done,
we're in the moose country.

37:30.367 --> 37:32.267
I'm coming back here
and hunting for sure.

37:32.533 --> 37:36.300
Kind of just gives me
a better idea of how rich
this country out here is.

37:48.300 --> 37:49.500
There's some spruce chickens.

37:49.567 --> 37:50.567
(GUN COCKS)

37:55.267 --> 37:56.500
(SOFTLY)
Tobias, stay, stay, stay.

37:56.567 --> 37:58.400
Tobias, don't scare it off.
Come here, Tobias.

38:00.767 --> 38:01.767
(GUN COCKS)

38:03.133 --> 38:04.133
There he is.

38:14.467 --> 38:15.533
I love spruce hen.

38:15.933 --> 38:17.300
Especially this time of year,

38:17.367 --> 38:19.367
they're full of berries
just like everything else.

38:20.567 --> 38:22.467
You got to know
what you can eat and
what you can't eat

38:22.533 --> 38:24.167
and take every advantage
you can get.

38:34.967 --> 38:38.267
I want to go home
and cook this grouse up
and relax around camp.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.433
I've done a lot of
tramping around today.

38:44.967 --> 38:46.500
All right, now I'm home.

38:46.833 --> 38:48.967
That was a heck of
an adventure there.

38:49.033 --> 38:50.767
Found my happy
hunting grounds

38:50.833 --> 38:52.333
and this is definitely
gonna be where

38:52.400 --> 38:54.400
I come back to this fall
for moose hunting.

38:54.467 --> 38:55.867
You never know
what's gonna happen out here.

38:55.933 --> 38:57.167
You might get a bear, too.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.767
Well, right now,
I'm sitting out here in some
new country to me

39:06.833 --> 39:09.133
and feeling very inspired
of where my life's going.

39:11.200 --> 39:14.267
This year it's just all been
about my boat and the river.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.267
'Cause those are
my main providers.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.200
The fish wheel
has been stuck

39:21.267 --> 39:23.233
and looking like it would
never make it either.

39:24.967 --> 39:28.200
Got that unstuck
and came back and
got that thing going.

39:29.400 --> 39:33.000
That's a huge relief
to see that old piece
of equipment survive,

39:33.067 --> 39:34.500
hopefully another year here.

39:36.267 --> 39:37.833
Getting my dog yard set up.

39:37.900 --> 39:39.700
New doghouses, new chains,

39:39.767 --> 39:42.367
so I'm not stuck worrying
about this stuff
come wintertime,

39:42.433 --> 39:44.000
when it's time
to really get busy.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.267
Now I'm out here,
scouting new country,

39:50.333 --> 39:52.800
and, uh, finding
a nice place that I want
to come back to here.

39:52.867 --> 39:54.833
Come fall time,
put up some moose,

39:54.900 --> 39:57.233
berries,
and some peace
in my heart.

39:57.433 --> 39:59.000
This is a life of adventure,

39:59.133 --> 40:00.633
and that's why
it's the life for me.

40:04.133 --> 40:06.633
I'm not a sedentary person,
I'm a nomadic person.

40:07.267 --> 40:09.033
I mean, I got a lot
to learn out here.

40:09.100 --> 40:12.233
The reason
for coming up here
is to invest my time,

40:12.300 --> 40:13.867
going out into
some real country.

40:13.933 --> 40:16.467
That just intrigues me
and makes me feel small.

40:17.567 --> 40:18.767
I love that feeling.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.600
Feel very small out here,
I feel very on my own.

40:21.700 --> 40:22.700
(FIRE CRACKLING)

40:22.933 --> 40:24.533
A lot of negative
things can happen

40:24.600 --> 40:26.367
and a lot of things can be
thrown in your way,

40:26.433 --> 40:29.900
but it's your attitude
and outlook on life

40:29.967 --> 40:31.367
that control where you go.

40:32.600 --> 40:35.500
And that attitude
has brought me
to a place like this.

40:43.333 --> 40:45.267
CHIP: We have
12 and 16-hour days
out here.

40:45.333 --> 40:48.000
We will work
from the time we're awake
to the time we go to bed.

40:56.933 --> 40:58.500
AGNES: Well, here's our lunch.

40:59.033 --> 41:02.367
A few pieces of salmon from
the inisuk for our picnic.

41:02.433 --> 41:05.367
I built a tower marker
down at the mouth
of the river,

41:05.433 --> 41:06.667
and I'm gonna go
show it to my wife,

41:06.733 --> 41:08.200
and she wants to go down
there and go eat lunch.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.667
It's just another
wonderful day
in the Arctic.

41:10.733 --> 41:11.800
Okay, loves.

41:12.233 --> 41:14.333
We'll go take us
a little cruise down
the mouth of the river

41:14.400 --> 41:15.433
and see what we see!

41:27.567 --> 41:28.667
AGNES: I love it.

41:31.100 --> 41:33.800
Awesome.
You guys did an awesome job.

41:34.267 --> 41:35.567
CAROL: I'm gonna go up.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.533
I'm just putting
the finishing touches
on this thing.

41:38.600 --> 41:41.267
Seems like my wife likes it,
which is important to me.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.100
Well, this thing's
for everybody.

41:45.167 --> 41:47.633
It's for you,
it's for Buckland people,
it's for Deering people.

41:48.500 --> 41:51.100
Everybody'll see it,
if they're off the trail,

41:51.167 --> 41:53.067
they'll know which way
to get back to the trail.

41:53.133 --> 41:54.300
No problem-o.

42:00.567 --> 42:02.400
AGNES: Wow.
CHIP: There you go.

42:03.333 --> 42:06.400
We should just throw
all that wood in a pile
right here and start a fire.

42:06.467 --> 42:07.767
You could get
some tea built, huh?

42:08.000 --> 42:10.467
Yeah, sounds like a good idea.
Man, I'm hungry.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.500
CHIP: Did pretty good
on berries this year, huh?

42:14.767 --> 42:16.500
AGNES: Yeah. Yeah.

42:16.567 --> 42:20.100
CHIP: Down by the ocean,
we're down here all summer,
the resources are rich.

42:20.833 --> 42:23.133
It's just been a really
wonderful summer.

42:24.867 --> 42:27.267
I love the peace here,
it's always quiet

42:27.333 --> 42:29.600
and there's just me
and my family here.

42:30.133 --> 42:31.633
If the rest of world
would be here,

42:31.700 --> 42:33.633
I don't think it would
ever be the same.

42:34.300 --> 42:35.733
CHIP:
We're gonna be
going into winter,

42:35.800 --> 42:38.633
right now darkness is coming,
and it'll be dark winter.

42:38.900 --> 42:40.367
And then it'll be
light winter again,

42:40.433 --> 42:42.400
and we'll make our way
back down here in February.

42:42.867 --> 42:44.467
I see this has been
a pretty good year.

42:44.533 --> 42:45.967
Good spring, good summer.

42:46.033 --> 42:48.533
We got a lot of fish up,
we got a lot of smoked salmon.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.667
The women are picking berries,
and while they're doing that,

42:50.733 --> 42:52.333
I've been gathering wood
and building things

42:52.400 --> 42:53.667
and then, uh,
getting firewood,

42:53.733 --> 42:55.067
because that's
constantly being used.

42:55.300 --> 42:56.467
We're heading into fall.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.200
Yep, something
to look forward to.

43:04.433 --> 43:06.267
Well, I look forward
to going to Noorvik, huh?

43:06.333 --> 43:07.333
Don't you?
