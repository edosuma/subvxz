There's something bothering me alone

14:47.847 --> 14:52.347
You need three things. a
stone cold shower and a glass of whiskey.

14:52.381 --> 14:54.281
And an incantation.

14:55.225 --> 14:59.025
An incantation?
- Yes, incantation.

42:40.910 --> 42:43.010
It is not the job, is it?

42:46.697 --> 42:47.797

42:59.546 --> 43:01.646
I think you're great.

43:02.301 --> 43:04.801
I wanna be with you in the neighborhood

Where are you going?
- That you do not understand anyway.

48:00.945 --> 48:04.445
Give it a try, because I
am open to anywhere.

48:04.811 --> 48:06.411
Would you hit me, then?

48:07.117 --> 48:09.017
Come on! Hit me again!

48:13.310 --> 48:15.910
I'm calling the police.
- You do that ...

48:15.996 --> 48:18.597
Or rot in here, that would
a relief.

48:23.130 --> 48:27.330
Hey, all of you.
Why you are not dead.

48:31.850 --> 48:33.750
Come on! Drop dead!

49:59.252 --> 50:00.552
Elevator need?

50:01.569 --> 50:02.569
No, thank you.

50:03.094 --> 50:06.794
Come on, I'll take you home. you can
bike throw back.

50:06.975 --> 50:10.975
I do not think so.
- They said I had to tell you something.

50:11.346 --> 50:14.446
She told me that I had to tell you,
that they do is not necessary anymore.

50:14.559 --> 50:16.459
She wanted that I told you that.

50:16.906 --> 50:18.606
For Real?
- Yup.

50:20.533 --> 50:22.833
I want to hear from her.

50:27.991 --> 50:28.991
Hey!

50:30.908 --> 50:32.508
Get in the car!

51:25.292 --> 51:28.492
He asked me if I wanted a lift and then
he said, that you no longer needed me.

51:28.493 --> 51:31.893
And what did you say?
- I said that I wanted to hear it from you.

51:31.914 --> 51:35.214
Stay away from that guy.
- How could he find me?

51:35.612 --> 51:39.512
Do not worry, it's not about you.
It's all about me.

51:40.125 --> 51:43.225
One day he will be his
get salary.

51:47.472 --> 51:51.372
What is this for?
- A guy who wants his own funeral.

51:51.740 --> 51:52.940
Erin!

51:55.636 --> 51:58.636
I do not like coffins.
- Do not you all go?

51:58.996 --> 51:59.996
Yes but ...

51:59.997 --> 52:02.397
Erin! You must.

52:20.046 --> 52:22.446
Whatever you do,
do not give a peep.

52:22.553 --> 52:25.553
Some of these dogs,
have very good hearing.

52:25.566 --> 52:28.266
Today you will be watched,
you go out there agree?

52:28.355 --> 52:29.555
Brave young.

52:30.595 --> 52:34.295
This necklace is a
symbol of your soul.

52:35.264 --> 52:39.864
If I do this necklace to your neck,
love you to be human.

52:40.150 --> 52:41.950
You will be Bonnie.

52:43.666 --> 52:44.666
The bit careful.

53:08.874 --> 53:13.274
Can you make it this time, without my
Destroying new shoes?

53:14.113 --> 53:16.313
For your own sake, I hope it.

53:16.788 --> 53:17.788
Wait!

53:18.888 --> 53:19.888
Go!

53:23.741 --> 53:26.841
My God.
What did you do, Bonnie?

53:27.444 --> 53:31.145
You have spilled water on
my new shoes.

53:31.289 --> 53:34.489
Every time, when I new shoes
Buy, destroy them.

53:35.054 --> 53:36.254
Come On!

53:36.858 --> 53:38.058
Grab it!

53:41.564 --> 53:43.564
Brave young.

53:46.365 --> 53:47.965
Lick it clean!

53:50.753 --> 53:52.153
Lick it clean, I said.

53:52.450 --> 53:55.150
Not the ankle, Bonnie, the shoe.

53:56.904 --> 53:57.904
Good.

54:15.455 --> 54:18.155
I am also so,
as I get older?

54:18.566 --> 54:21.466
It could be worse, you could have a
social worker may be.

54:24.207 --> 54:26.207
Do you have a driver's license?

54:26.993 --> 54:29.893
I have lessons.
- That's a license

54:30.118 --> 54:31.318
Come on!

54:31.965 --> 54:34.765
I can only ride with someone who
has a license. Do you have that?

54:35.693 --> 54:37.493
But they have taken him.

54:37.585 --> 54:41.185
Marlene, Charlie?
Charlie, Marlene.

54:44.868 --> 54:47.168
I do not think I
Marlene can drive.

55:03.514 --> 55:05.114
What are we looking for?

55:05.335 --> 55:08.135
Still lame.
We wait.

55:20.397 --> 55:22.997
Can you talk to people,
who no longer lives?

55:27.379 --> 55:32.579
But beginning to talk,
they are everywhere.

55:37.391 --> 55:39.391
I do not know what to say.

55:39.705 --> 55:41.505
Who is it?

55:42.983 --> 55:44.383
My father.

55:48.908 --> 55:50.908
When did it happen?

55:52.032 --> 55:53.632
Three and a half weeks ago.

55:56.172 --> 55:57.472
Charlie.

55:59.180 --> 56:01.380
I think it's my fault.

56:07.786 --> 56:09.186
Come here!

56:14.805 --> 56:16.705
Close your eyes!

56:24.849 --> 56:26.349
Can you see him?

56:29.689 --> 56:31.689
Without a doubt.

56:37.343 --> 56:39.043
I see him.

56:42.438 --> 56:44.738
What would you ask him.

56:48.461 --> 56:51.061
I want to know if he's mad at me?

56:52.191 --> 56:54.991
So ... you have to ask him that.

57:07.302 --> 57:09.502
He does not talk to me.

57:11.700 --> 57:14.300
He does so,
he will give you a sign.

57:15.394 --> 57:17.094
I see the sign.

57:18.951 --> 57:20.751
Have patience.

57:22.649 --> 57:24.149
You'll see.

58:18.603 --> 58:20.403
You know one of these children?

58:27.497 --> 58:28.997
Let's go.

58:45.783 --> 58:47.583
Do you still need something else?

58:48.451 --> 58:49.451
Noo.

58:51.112 --> 58:54.312
I go once again to work.
- Do not do it.

58:59.095 --> 59:00.995
Let's do it.

59:10.040 --> 59:12.040
In the second from the bottom.

59:40.697 --> 59:42.897
In the bottom.

01:00:28.469 --> 01:00:30.169
You're so pretty.

01:00:48.246 --> 01:00:51.246
Now, your test is back.
He is negative.

01:00:51.451 --> 01:00:54.251
We have good news
your probation officer.

01:00:54.914 --> 01:00:58.314
And everything seems to relax you,
so it looks good.

01:00:58.642 --> 01:01:03.042
Our recommendation is that we have a date
prick, to recover custody.

01:01:03.055 --> 01:01:04.355
Thank u.

01:01:05.009 --> 01:01:07.109
Hey, Maggie, where are you?

01:01:21.421 --> 01:01:23.321
I had that drink problem.

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:28.290
I met a guy,
that sucked me along,

01:01:28.668 --> 01:01:30.168
in Paris.

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:33.962
And then, here we are
and moved to ...

01:01:35.293 --> 01:01:36.993
I can not leave.

01:01:40.732 --> 01:01:42.632
Why do not you leave?

01:01:47.669 --> 01:01:49.469
I babysat him.

01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:52.239
Our child.
He was my responsibility,

01:01:52.516 --> 01:01:56.016
but I slept every morning
my daze, so ...

01:01:56.093 --> 01:02:00.993
One day I came out of the room
and he was gone and ...

01:02:01.776 --> 01:02:03.976
I kept searching everywhere

01:02:04.025 --> 01:02:06.826
but I could not find him.
So ...

01:02:08.859 --> 01:02:12.059
He had gone out,
the street and he was ...

01:02:14.534 --> 01:02:16.834
hit by a motorcyclist.

01:02:16.951 --> 01:02:20.651
And he was on the street and kept
say, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

01:02:20.684 --> 01:02:23.684
As if it was his fault.
It was my fault.

01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:30.792
Immediately afterwards I took an overdose.

01:02:31.076 --> 01:02:34.076
I hoped that the
was an overdose.

01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:39.649
What happened to that child
and his mother.

01:02:42.443 --> 01:02:45.243
I was the mother, Charlie.

01:02:46.504 --> 01:02:48.504
The child was mine.

01:02:54.566 --> 01:02:56.566
I can not touch you.

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:02.376
I dress myself out.

01:03:10.992 --> 01:03:13.492
This is our first day,
I'm upset.

01:03:14.353 --> 01:03:16.553
I come here to be quiet.

01:03:31.251 --> 01:03:33.351
That does not work for me.

01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:36.230
Well ...

01:03:36.737 --> 01:03:38.537
there is a plan B.

01:04:06.133 --> 01:04:07.333
Right Here!

01:04:09.558 --> 01:04:10.658
See that?

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.700
Okay.
- If yes.

01:04:18.399 --> 01:04:19.899
If you ...
- No, this is better.

01:04:20.952 --> 01:04:22.352
Look, it works.

01:04:27.801 --> 01:04:29.301
Do you like it?

01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:44.669
Look they look.

01:04:46.962 --> 01:04:48.462
It's more like ...

01:04:53.304 --> 01:04:54.304
Cunt!

01:04:54.956 --> 01:04:56.756
I can not him
to face.

01:04:57.021 --> 01:04:58.821
Take me somewhere.

01:05:08.462 --> 01:05:11.762
Grab my hand.
- Yeah, I feel like 16 again.

01:05:13.462 --> 01:05:14.462
vagina! Sorry!

01:05:20.295 --> 01:05:24.095
My mother was in the room next to it.
Okay, wait here, I'll take that.

01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:25.921
Do not touch anything.

01:05:26.421 --> 01:05:28.021
I will not, sir.

01:05:34.189 --> 01:05:37.889
Try to stabbing the house on fire?
- Charlie...

01:05:41.747 --> 01:05:44.447
What do you do?
- That does not work.

01:05:50.131 --> 01:05:52.131
I'm so ashamed.

01:05:54.715 --> 01:05:57.115
I can not do this anymore.

01:06:01.568 --> 01:06:05.068
I told you not to touch anything.
- Your mother is in excellent condition, huh?

01:06:05.619 --> 01:06:07.519
Is that your dad?
- Do not you touch that.

01:06:10.661 --> 01:06:12.661
A cowboy, huh?

01:06:13.043 --> 01:06:14.643
Cowboy!

01:06:14.942 --> 01:06:16.742
Give it to me.
- No, come on.

01:06:18.786 --> 01:06:23.986
... You're out of control.
Just sit. Sit!

01:06:30.497 --> 01:06:32.397
Hey.
- Hey.

01:06:34.474 --> 01:06:35.774
Cheers.

01:06:43.083 --> 01:06:44.483
Come here!

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:53.230
You do not, but here?

01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:55.543
Noo.

01:06:59.451 --> 01:07:05.151
I'm just ...
attract something easier.

01:07:10.009 --> 01:07:11.809
What do you do?

01:07:12.694 --> 01:07:15.194
Nothing At All. Just ...
- Nothing At All?

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:24.939
What do you love behind your back?

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:27.870
Nothing At All.

01:07:30.086 --> 01:07:31.686
Only boxer shorts.

01:07:32.557 --> 01:07:35.057
And ...
In the other hand?

01:07:39.761 --> 01:07:41.161
Open up!

01:07:46.491 --> 01:07:48.391
Oh my goodness.
No, come on.

01:07:48.571 --> 01:07:51.171
I'm going to have sex with you.
- I ... I know, I know.

01:07:51.786 --> 01:07:54.686
Okay.
- I thought ... I thought you ...

01:07:54.924 --> 01:07:56.724
It was for the case
you think it was going to do.

01:07:56.787 --> 01:07:58.387
For the case?

01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:09.070
How did he die?

01:08:09.773 --> 01:08:11.873
He hanged himself in the garage.

01:08:18.131 --> 01:08:19.430
I found him.

01:08:22.567 --> 01:08:24.867
Do not blame yourself.

01:08:29.533 --> 01:08:31.634
Kiss me and make it better?

01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:35.828
No, you're not going to me
fooled.

01:08:38.572 --> 01:08:40.671
Would you leave me?

01:08:41.788 --> 01:08:45.189
There is a place where all women
with younger guys to go.

01:08:46.104 --> 01:08:51.203
Everywhere older women and younger guys.
- City of cougars.

01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:55.390
Come on, we seem normal there.
- I do not think it's ever normal.

01:09:02.459 --> 01:09:04.259
I love you, Maggie.

01:09:21.988 --> 01:09:23.589

01:09:23.941 --> 01:09:26.541
Hey ...
- I do not have time for this.

01:09:26.654 --> 01:09:30.154
I'd like to come along,
to see if you could use your help.

01:09:30.156 --> 01:09:33.956

Without me touching it.

01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:47.435
Like this?

01:09:55.012 --> 01:09:56.012
Noo.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.159

01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:26.790
All Of It.

01:10:28.124 --> 01:10:29.624
Please, mistress.

01:10:48.039 --> 01:10:50.339

Yup.

01:11:08.969 --> 01:11:10.669

But you know the rules, right?

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:20.941
You need to be punished,

01:11:21.291 --> 01:11:23.591
for touching me.

01:11:30.803 --> 01:11:31.803

01:11:34.432 --> 01:11:35.532
Okey.

01:11:35.719 --> 01:11:37.219
Maggie, that's enough.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.560

01:14:50.873 --> 01:14:53.473
I want you right in the face
say hello.

01:14:58.672 --> 01:15:01.472
What's wrong?
- It's over.

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:10.335
Why now?
- We have gone too far.

01:15:12.104 --> 01:15:14.404
Maggie, come back.
Where you going.

01:15:16.161 --> 01:15:18.561
We do not quit.
It's amazing.

01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:23.730
I'd rather kill myself than you
to lose. I will do.

01:15:25.311 --> 01:15:27.111
Not blackmailing me.

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.860
I do not cock. Not yours,
not from anyone.

01:15:30.871 --> 01:15:33.571
Maggie, wait.
- Go away.

01:15:33.615 --> 01:15:35.315
Maggie, wait.

01:15:39.614 --> 01:15:41.014
Maggie?

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:04.941
Mistress, may I come in?

01:16:14.796 --> 01:16:18.096
Hey, Maggie, what ...
What's going on, huh?

01:16:22.330 --> 01:16:23.330
Vagina!

01:16:32.147 --> 01:16:33.147
Maggie!

01:16:38.159 --> 01:16:39.159
<i>Maggie!</i>

01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:53.590
Drop dead!

01:17:09.336 --> 01:17:14.436
Hey, look, mistress! You cunt chairs
Located in the cunt pool, huh?

01:17:18.391 --> 01:17:22.591
There lies your cunt umbrella in
cunt pool. Cunt!

01:17:23.057 --> 01:17:26.657
Do you think I do that out,
for you? No way!

01:17:36.425 --> 01:17:38.025
Hey, come on down.

01:17:38.098 --> 01:17:41.499
<i> Come on, get down.
I know you're up there. </ I></i>

01:17:42.338 --> 01:17:43.338
<i>Hey?</i>

01:17:55.817 --> 01:17:56.817
<i>Maggie!</i>

01:17:57.502 --> 01:17:58.902
<i>Maggie!</i>

01:18:01.324 --> 01:18:05.424
Fine. Do not come down.
You, cunt bitch.

01:18:32.081 --> 01:18:33.681
Fuck you, Maggie!

01:19:08.284 --> 01:19:09.284
Well ...

01:19:10.305 --> 01:19:13.405
This is our last cup of tea, right?

01:19:17.524 --> 01:19:20.124
After this you come down here,
to the bank.

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:23.991
You make my clothes off.

01:19:25.024 --> 01:19:26.524
You Kiss Me.

01:19:27.579 --> 01:19:29.879
You touch me and
love me.

01:19:30.469 --> 01:19:33.769
You let me see all of your feelings,
the you say that you have.

01:19:34.788 --> 01:19:37.488
And then you'll say goodbye.

01:19:37.909 --> 01:19:40.309
And I want you to never
come back.

01:19:40.741 --> 01:19:42.541
Is that clear?

01:19:46.186 --> 01:19:47.786
Yes, mistress.

01:19:48.638 --> 01:19:49.738
Noo.

01:19:51.317 --> 01:19:53.717
Now it is between you and me.

01:19:54.344 --> 01:19:56.044
No more mistress.

01:20:06.479 --> 01:20:08.079
Well, come here.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.720
I want the two of us.

01:22:58.601 --> 01:23:01.101
Why are all the furniture
in the pool?

01:23:07.668 --> 01:23:09.268
Sit down.

01:23:41.196 --> 01:23:43.596
I give you nothing.

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:48.771
What are you talking about?
- It's over.

01:23:53.105 --> 01:23:55.005
And our plan then?

01:23:56.367 --> 01:23:57.767
Our plan.

01:24:00.523 --> 01:24:01.723
Over.

01:24:07.754 --> 01:24:10.054
Come on.
- Yeah, come on.

01:24:11.161 --> 01:24:13.461
Stand up.
Stand up!

01:24:13.855 --> 01:24:15.755
Do not touch me!

01:24:15.883 --> 01:24:17.283
Stand up!
- No.

01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:19.185
Hey, what are you doing?
You hurt her.

01:24:19.244 --> 01:24:21.444
You have no idea what deal
she made me.

01:24:21.445 --> 01:24:23.745
Come on!
- No, damn it!

01:24:28.724 --> 01:24:31.124
Maggie!
- Go away. I kill you.

01:24:43.931 --> 01:24:46.931
Get out of my life. Both!
Go away.

01:25:05.931 --> 01:25:07.731
Thanks for coming.

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:14.915
Let's do it right.
Uh, Charlie?

01:25:16.071 --> 01:25:17.971
Charlie, this is Ellis.

01:25:20.439 --> 01:25:22.839
She needs to talk to you,
about your girlfriend.

01:25:30.245 --> 01:25:32.045
Hallo, Charlie.

01:25:33.476 --> 01:25:35.076
I'm Ellis.

01:25:35.458 --> 01:25:36.858
Are you awake?

01:25:41.642 --> 01:25:47.042
Charlie, I need to ask you something.
Do you have a relationship with your girlfriend?

01:25:49.972 --> 01:25:52.272
I see that as a yes.

01:25:54.521 --> 01:25:56.621
What kind of relationship?

01:25:57.150 --> 01:25:59.950
A "you have nothing
to make "relationship.

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:05.589
Charlie, I do not ask much,
but it was a sexual relationship?

01:26:06.425 --> 01:26:08.125
I'm 16.

01:26:08.943 --> 01:26:10.743
I want to ...
- Bugger!

01:26:49.217 --> 01:26:50.217
Hey.

01:26:52.787 --> 01:26:54.687
I want you to come down here.

01:27:03.909 --> 01:27:04.909
Sit down!

01:27:15.683 --> 01:27:17.883
Take what you like.

01:27:23.245 --> 01:27:26.245
That's your father.
Just before he left England.

01:27:29.794 --> 01:27:32.094
You know, love is not
easy, Charlie.

01:27:33.156 --> 01:27:35.956
It is complicated.
It's messy.

01:27:37.484 --> 01:27:39.284
And it hurts.

01:27:39.881 --> 01:27:42.981
It hurts like hell, but
that does not mean that you stop.

01:27:43.934 --> 01:27:46.034
So I want you packed everything ...

01:27:48.361 --> 01:27:50.161
what you need.

01:27:52.036 --> 01:27:53.936
Because I want you to go.

01:28:03.427 --> 01:28:04.727
Because Of ...

01:28:08.596 --> 01:28:11.096
I can not live with someone,
who hate me.

01:28:16.597 --> 01:28:21.883
But when you come back ...
I will be here.

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.640
Since I've been here forever.

01:29:15.653 --> 01:29:17.453
Come on, Charlie.

01:29:19.377 --> 01:29:20.777
He is gone.

01:29:42.574 --> 01:29:46.275
It hurts so much.
- I know.

01:29:47.494 --> 01:29:48.994
I know.

01:29:51.177 --> 01:29:52.877
It'll be okay.

01:29:57.953 --> 01:29:59.353
Look, okay.

01:31:49.032 --> 01:31:50.032
Hey There.

01:31:50.323 --> 01:31:51.323
Hallo.

01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:58.080
Is everything okay, because ...
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:07.310
So you go away.

01:32:07.523 --> 01:32:09.923
I came back,
to retrieve the rest.

01:32:13.581 --> 01:32:15.281
You'll be fine.

01:32:28.619 --> 01:32:31.519
Who you also get,
will be very happy.

01:32:37.279 --> 01:32:39.579
I think we farewell
should take.

01:32:44.612 --> 01:32:45.912
I call you.

01:32:46.833 --> 01:32:48.433
Do not take on.

01:32:49.747 --> 01:32:52.147
I beg you to call me.

01:32:53.319 --> 01:32:54.819
Do not do it.

01:32:55.358 --> 01:32:57.658
I do not you walk past on the street.

01:32:58.502 --> 01:32:59.802
You know me.

01:33:01.373 --> 01:33:04.673
I will tell anyone that I like them
love, but you will not be.

01:33:20.245 --> 01:33:22.045
Thank you, Maggie.

01:33:24.154 --> 01:33:25.754
It's my pleasure.

01:33:55.841 --> 01:33:57.741
That was his favorite.

01:34:03.133 --> 01:34:07.885
I want to be happy,
for when I get older.

01:34:10.893 --> 01:34:12.093
Is that okey?

01:34:13.307 --> 01:34:14.307
Yup ...

01:34:14.712 --> 01:34:16.212
I think so.

01:34:52.746 --> 01:34:54.046
Come on, mate.
