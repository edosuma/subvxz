00:03.000 --> 00:04.750
Previously on MECH-X4:

00:04.834 --> 00:07.625
(Leo) The monsters are sent
by people. Terrible people!

00:07.709 --> 00:09.750
That's why I built MECH-X4.

00:09.834 --> 00:11.500
But you have to keep
your identity a secret.

00:11.583 --> 00:13.542
(Principal Grey) I want to know
exactly who they are

00:13.625 --> 00:15.458
and where that robot is.

00:15.542 --> 00:18.750
-And after that?
-Then we get rid of all of them.

00:18.834 --> 00:20.083
(Ryan)
Someone targeted us!

00:20.166 --> 00:22.542
Someone knows
that we're MECH-X4.

00:22.625 --> 00:23.834
Come on!
Go, go, go, go!

00:23.917 --> 00:26.208
(Davage) You have no idea
what you're up against.

00:26.291 --> 00:28.291
You and the robot
are coming with me!

00:29.291 --> 00:30.458
Mark! Mark, I gotta warn him!

00:30.542 --> 00:31.917
We have to get back!

00:37.250 --> 00:39.750
(roaring)

00:41.583 --> 00:43.250
No, no, no!

00:43.333 --> 00:44.834
Where's Mark?

00:44.917 --> 00:45.834
Is he inside the robot?

00:45.917 --> 00:47.291
Hold on!

00:51.125 --> 00:52.166
What are you doing?

00:53.709 --> 00:56.333
I'm trying to connect
with MECH-X4...

00:56.417 --> 00:58.166
through the robot's cameras.

00:58.250 --> 00:59.333
(grunting)

00:59.417 --> 01:02.583
I see Mark and...
and someone else!

01:02.667 --> 01:03.583
(screams)

01:03.667 --> 01:05.041
Mark!

01:05.125 --> 01:07.709
I can't lose
my focus again.

01:07.792 --> 01:10.834
I have to take control
of MECH-X4 and bring Mark back!

01:10.917 --> 01:13.917
But you've never tried
to control the robot from the outside!

01:14.000 --> 01:15.208
You don't know
what could happen!

01:15.291 --> 01:16.875
I have to try!

01:21.208 --> 01:23.291
I've almost got it!

01:23.375 --> 01:25.208
Almost!

01:26.458 --> 01:27.542
What's happening?

01:28.792 --> 01:30.834
(screams)

01:34.291 --> 01:35.542
It's gone.

01:36.542 --> 01:38.667
-You okay?
-(coughing) Yeah.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.250
What are we gonna do?

01:40.333 --> 01:41.875
They have the robot

01:41.959 --> 01:43.667
and they have my brother.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.875
I have to get them back.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.625
(theme music playing)

02:22.041 --> 02:24.834
-(sighs)
-Hey, are you okay?

02:24.917 --> 02:26.750
Yeah. I told you, I'm fine.

02:26.834 --> 02:28.542
I just... I feel
a little drained.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.834
Can we just...
hurry up and look around?

02:30.917 --> 02:32.250
Maybe Leo has some way

02:32.333 --> 02:33.583
to track MECH-X4, okay?

02:33.667 --> 02:34.875
Guys...

02:35.959 --> 02:37.166
what about this button?

02:37.250 --> 02:38.709
-(beep)
-(hisses)

02:38.792 --> 02:40.709
(screaming)

02:42.542 --> 02:44.000
Don't make it stink!

02:44.083 --> 02:45.542
Oh, dang, son!

02:45.625 --> 02:48.000
Out! Out, out, out, out, out!

02:48.083 --> 02:50.041
Go! Go to the light!
Go to the light!

02:51.375 --> 02:53.542
(Both)
Close the door!

02:53.625 --> 02:55.000
(sighing)

02:55.083 --> 02:56.709
(Spyder)
That was close.

02:56.792 --> 02:58.709
(Harris) Okay, back to
the task at hand.

03:05.834 --> 03:07.291
(Harris)
I got something.

03:07.375 --> 03:08.625
Hey, check this out.

03:08.709 --> 03:11.709
Looks like Leo's set up
some kind of transponder system.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.291
The robot's constantly
sending out a tracking signal

03:14.375 --> 03:16.333
on a secret frequency,
and the satellite dish

03:16.417 --> 03:18.417
on Leo's roof is
set up to connect to it.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.667
Let me see if I can
get the GPS coordinates.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.125
Well, good work, Harris!

03:24.375 --> 03:25.750
Oh, bad work, Harris!

03:25.834 --> 03:28.709
-What did you do?
-The robot must have gone out of range.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.917
The satellite's not strong enough
to reach that far.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.792
Great. How are we gonna
get MECH-X4 and find Mark?

03:33.875 --> 03:35.834
Yeah, they can be
anywhere in the world.

03:35.917 --> 03:38.417
Anywhere on planet Earth.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.750
I just said that.

03:39.834 --> 03:41.709
Wait, this is
planet Earth, right?

03:41.792 --> 03:43.208
This is Earth.

03:43.291 --> 03:44.750
I know that...

03:44.834 --> 03:46.583
now.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.750
And these are satellites

03:48.834 --> 03:50.667
directly above
the base of the area.

03:50.750 --> 03:52.458
They're strong enough
to pick up signals

03:52.542 --> 03:53.667
anywhere on the planet.

03:53.750 --> 03:56.709
Which means they can
pick up MECH-X4's signal

03:56.792 --> 03:58.041
and track it from anywhere!

03:58.125 --> 04:00.542
All I have to do
is take the satellite,

04:00.625 --> 04:01.792
point it at Bay City.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.583
-Let's do it!
-Yeah, let's go save Mark!

04:04.625 --> 04:06.125
-Aah!
-(squeaks)

04:07.291 --> 04:08.375
Okay...

04:08.458 --> 04:10.875
(Ryan and Harris)
Okay, okay...

04:11.000 --> 04:12.875
-It's all yours.
-(shrieks)

04:12.959 --> 04:14.458
Just turn out the lights
when you're done!

04:19.166 --> 04:20.875
(shuffling)

04:21.959 --> 04:24.083
Stop! Struggling!

04:24.166 --> 04:25.792
Stop breathing on me.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.667
You smell like milk
and protein drink.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.125
That's it!

04:29.208 --> 04:31.917
Did I give you
a termination order?

04:32.959 --> 04:34.291
-No.
-No.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.709
Then back off, Davage.

04:36.792 --> 04:39.667
"Davage." It has a name.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.625
Have you hacked into the robot's
operating system yet?

04:42.709 --> 04:45.000
-Uh...
-Weak! Worthless!

04:45.083 --> 04:46.500
Find me someone better.

04:55.583 --> 04:56.667
Principal Grey?

04:56.750 --> 04:58.041
Surprise.

05:09.709 --> 05:12.792
Wow, that's a lot of security.

05:12.875 --> 05:15.208
-What is this place?
-Ah, it's some government building.

05:15.291 --> 05:17.709
No, I told you guys,
it's the headquarters

05:17.792 --> 05:19.792
for Project Starry Night.

05:19.875 --> 05:22.625
They've got satellites
searching the universe

05:22.709 --> 05:24.208
for signs of intelligent life.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.000
Like... like aliens?

05:26.083 --> 05:28.375
Well, are they the friendly kind
or the proby kind?

05:29.792 --> 05:31.250
'Cause there's a difference.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.583
Let's add "proby"
to the list of words

05:33.667 --> 05:35.917
we never want to hear again.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.417
Harris, do your magic.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.542
Okay, the best entrance
is a side door.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.750
-(Harris) How do we get in?
-That guard won't cycle back

05:41.834 --> 05:43.542
for another 32 seconds.

05:44.750 --> 05:47.583
That's how long you'll have
to hack the lock.

05:49.375 --> 05:51.333
Oh, this is harder
than it looks!

05:51.417 --> 05:52.875
-So is jail!
-It's not that bad.

05:52.959 --> 05:55.542
Or, uh, so I've been told.

05:55.625 --> 05:57.083
You gotta hurry, dude!

06:01.250 --> 06:02.417
They're coming
around the corner.

06:04.583 --> 06:05.667
Ugh, I need more time!

06:06.750 --> 06:08.959
-You don't have it!
-I have...

06:09.041 --> 06:10.208
this.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.291
Uh...

06:24.208 --> 06:25.208
Got it!

06:31.375 --> 06:33.583
I thought there were only
three kids in MECH-X,

06:33.667 --> 06:34.959
but I guess
there were four.

06:35.041 --> 06:36.125
How did you find us?

06:36.208 --> 06:37.709
We're asking the questions!

06:38.875 --> 06:41.834
-(growls)
-I'm so glad you're here, Mark.

06:41.917 --> 06:46.333
I'm having trouble
activating the robot,

06:46.417 --> 06:48.375
so we're gonna
need you to tell us.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.709
-Or?
-Or you're done.

06:50.792 --> 06:52.250
Just like your brother.

06:52.333 --> 06:55.166
And that would be
a real shame

06:55.250 --> 06:56.583
because I was really hoping

06:56.667 --> 06:58.458
you'd take us
to State this year!

06:59.458 --> 07:01.000
Okay, wait, wait.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.125
What do you mean
by "done"?

07:02.208 --> 07:04.250
As in gone.

07:04.333 --> 07:06.625
I hired someone
to take out your brother

07:06.709 --> 07:09.750
and his little friends
on the camping trip.

07:09.834 --> 07:12.625
-You're saying Ryan's gone?
-Mm-hmm.

07:16.792 --> 07:19.792
(laughs)

07:21.166 --> 07:24.375
Have you heard from your flunky
since the campout?

07:26.208 --> 07:27.500
Thought so.

07:27.583 --> 07:30.125
My bro is way more dangerous
than you know.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.208
How is Ryan dangerous?

07:32.291 --> 07:34.875
Oh, don't worry, you'll find out.

07:34.959 --> 07:37.750
For a minute there,
I didn't think we were gonna make it.

07:37.834 --> 07:39.709
See, you know what?
That's your problem, Harris.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.959
-(Both) No! Spyder!
-Okay? No faith in your friends...

07:42.041 --> 07:43.750
-There's a pressure plate!
-(beeping)

07:43.834 --> 07:46.166
-(alarm wailing)
-(Officer) Move, move, move!

07:53.375 --> 07:54.625
(alarm wailing)

08:01.458 --> 08:03.834
All right, guys, the rented goons
are gone. Come out.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.208
We need to get to
the satellite control center.

08:07.291 --> 08:08.875
Harris?

08:08.959 --> 08:10.458
I got this.

08:10.542 --> 08:13.041
My sister spoke here
at a panel once.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.291
-It's this way.
-Wait. Hey, guys,

08:14.375 --> 08:16.959
watch out for pressure plates.
They come out of nowhere.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.959
Security camera! Fry it!

08:25.875 --> 08:27.792
(Principal Grey)
Hey, Mark. Hungry?

08:30.083 --> 08:31.917
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.375
Here. Here, eat.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.500
Is that cafeteria food?

08:38.583 --> 08:40.667
It smells like
yesterday's mystery meat.

08:40.750 --> 08:41.917
How do I know
it's not poisoned?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.667
(scoffs)
You're being paranoid.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.000
You wanna take
the first bite?

08:46.041 --> 08:48.458
No, you're right,
it's school food.

08:49.542 --> 08:50.625
(sighs)

08:51.750 --> 08:55.917
You know, I have always
liked you, Walker.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.667
Yeah. You are good at almost
everything you do.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.333
Almost?

08:59.417 --> 09:00.458
Italian.

09:00.542 --> 09:02.125
A C is still
a passing grade.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.500
Which you achieved
while being on every sports team

09:05.583 --> 09:07.667
and being in that robot.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.750
There's value in that.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.458
Tell me how
to operate MECH-X,

09:12.542 --> 09:17.041
and I'll see if I can
find a place for you in our...

09:17.125 --> 09:18.583
community.

09:18.667 --> 09:19.959
-(gasps)
-Mm-hmm.

09:20.041 --> 09:21.750
-You have a little club.
-Mm-hmm.

09:21.834 --> 09:23.291
Do you have nicknames too?

09:24.667 --> 09:25.959
Davage...

09:27.041 --> 09:28.125
make him talk.

09:30.709 --> 09:32.583
Everybody out!

09:32.667 --> 09:33.875
Here we go.

09:38.542 --> 09:39.875
So, it's, uh...

09:39.959 --> 09:42.041
it's just us, huh?

09:42.125 --> 09:44.375
(grunts)
Okay.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.208
How much are
they paying you to do this?

09:46.291 --> 09:48.625
Pay? I'm here because I believe.

09:48.709 --> 09:49.959
-Unlike you!
-Okay.

09:50.041 --> 09:52.917
Um... you wanna learn
how to pilot the robot?

09:53.917 --> 09:55.875
Listen close.
This is important.

10:05.208 --> 10:06.834
(growls)

10:10.875 --> 10:13.417
That. Grab it.
Put it in front of the door.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.083
Guys, this is it...

10:16.166 --> 10:18.417
the control center
for the satellites.

10:19.917 --> 10:21.917
Okay. Let's go to work.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.875
Okay, I'm getting the machines
to position the satellites

10:27.959 --> 10:29.750
faced towards Earth.

10:39.917 --> 10:41.500
(beeping)

10:48.667 --> 10:49.834
(Ryan)
Yes!

10:49.917 --> 10:52.041
Okay, I'm programming
the satellite to find

10:52.125 --> 10:54.125
the robot's secret frequency.

10:54.208 --> 10:56.959
And I'm typing random letters
so I feel involved.

10:57.041 --> 10:59.583
Where are you, Mark?

10:59.667 --> 11:02.583
Spread out. That kid's gotta
be around here somewhere.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.792
(guards yelling)

11:04.875 --> 11:06.000
(Guard)
Go, go, go!

11:12.542 --> 11:14.500
Power generator. Sweet.

11:14.583 --> 11:15.875
Okay, uh...

11:15.959 --> 11:17.250
these look important.

11:24.625 --> 11:26.083
(overlapping chatter)

11:26.166 --> 11:28.125
(Man) Check all systems,
check all systems.

11:29.959 --> 11:31.875
(guards yelling)

11:33.417 --> 11:34.792
Whoops.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.375
It's MECH-X4!

11:38.458 --> 11:40.458
Wait, so... so where is it?

11:40.542 --> 11:42.291
Triangulating now.

11:44.000 --> 11:44.959
(Harris)
Uh...

11:45.041 --> 11:46.291
it's the middle of nowhere.

11:46.375 --> 11:48.542
Wait, so how are we gonna
get all the way out there?

11:48.625 --> 11:51.834
I mean, we can't take the bus.
I'm banned for life.

11:51.917 --> 11:54.250
Oh, right.
Gas station sushi.

11:54.333 --> 11:56.750
-(door rattles)
-(Guard) They're in the command center!

11:56.834 --> 11:57.750
-Uh-oh.
-Open the door!

11:57.834 --> 12:00.250
-Let's go.
-Open up! Push it down!

12:00.333 --> 12:01.792
(officer continues shouting)

12:01.875 --> 12:04.542
Okay, you heard the man. Now!

12:05.792 --> 12:07.250
-Whoa!
-(guards grunting)

12:07.333 --> 12:08.417
Lights out!

12:08.500 --> 12:09.750
Let's go!

12:13.000 --> 12:15.834
Get these machines
back online, or...

12:15.917 --> 12:17.417
(phone chirps)

12:17.500 --> 12:18.875
Oh.

12:18.959 --> 12:20.375
Uh, sir!

12:20.458 --> 12:21.625
-(Leader) We clear?
-Yes!

12:21.709 --> 12:23.417
-Status?
-Oh, everything's fine.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.166
-I'll be there soon.
-Great. See you then.

12:27.291 --> 12:28.542
Everything isn't fine.

12:28.625 --> 12:30.458
Oh, really?

12:30.542 --> 12:32.834
I hadn't noticed everything
is going pear-shaped.

12:32.917 --> 12:35.375
The leader is gonna
be here any minute!

12:35.375 --> 12:36.834
So there's a leader.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.834
Walker is becoming
more trouble than he's worth.

12:38.917 --> 12:41.291
Get rid of him. Permanently.

12:50.458 --> 12:52.041
(Ryan)
Thanks for the ride, Mom!

12:53.125 --> 12:54.959
Guys, it's MECH-X4!

12:55.041 --> 12:56.125
Where?

12:59.250 --> 13:00.500
Seriously?

13:00.583 --> 13:03.625
I crack jokes in the face of fear.
You know that.

13:04.875 --> 13:06.542
Tents, guards,

13:06.625 --> 13:08.667
mobile labs?
Who are these people?

13:08.750 --> 13:10.291
You know, let's just get
inside the robot,

13:10.375 --> 13:12.750
find Mark, and get
the heck out of here!

13:12.834 --> 13:14.792
You know what?
That reminds me. Knock, knock.

13:14.875 --> 13:15.875
Knock it off.

13:19.291 --> 13:20.417
He's near.

13:23.542 --> 13:24.917
Come on. Come on.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.291
-Quietly.
-(Spyder) Whoa!

13:26.375 --> 13:27.667
Down!

13:30.166 --> 13:32.125
(powers up, stalls)

13:32.208 --> 13:34.333
We got this.

13:46.917 --> 13:48.291
Mark's not there.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.208
-(Guard) Hey! Gotcha!
-(Spyder) Busted!

14:16.291 --> 14:17.709
(guard laughs)

14:17.792 --> 14:19.417
Seems like you boys are lost.

14:20.583 --> 14:22.000
I found 'em... (groans)

14:25.041 --> 14:27.333
-What took you guys so long?
-Mark!

14:29.542 --> 14:31.291
Oh, uh...

14:31.375 --> 14:33.458
-(both chuckle)
-It's okay to have feelings, guys.

14:34.208 --> 14:35.458
Let's get out of here!

14:35.542 --> 14:36.625
(Guard)
Hey, there they are!

14:36.709 --> 14:38.875
-Oh, that's not good.
-(guards yelling)

14:38.959 --> 14:40.125
Aw, that's worse.

14:40.875 --> 14:42.166
(Ryan)
No, that's the worst!

14:42.250 --> 14:44.625
(Guard) Move out of the way!
Move! Clear!

14:44.709 --> 14:45.875
(guards yelling)

14:50.125 --> 14:51.125
Ryan!

15:08.375 --> 15:10.417
I didn't know you could control
the robot from outside.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.709
Yeah, neither did I.

15:11.792 --> 15:14.125
Spyder, give me a little chaos.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.834
Oh, you know
I love some chaos!

15:23.959 --> 15:25.000
(sighs)

15:28.291 --> 15:29.417
(gasps)

15:30.875 --> 15:31.875
(chuckles)

15:41.125 --> 15:42.750
Sir, come back!

15:42.834 --> 15:45.375
I can handle this. I have got
this under control... (screams)

15:58.917 --> 16:00.333
The bad guy
is Principal Grey?

16:00.417 --> 16:01.709
I knew it!

16:01.792 --> 16:04.458
I person who allows that many
pop quizzes must be a villain.

16:06.250 --> 16:07.291
(beeps)

16:10.875 --> 16:12.083
(roars)

16:20.583 --> 16:21.583
What was that?

16:32.834 --> 16:35.542
(gagging)

16:35.625 --> 16:38.667
-Oh, gross!
-What is that?

16:38.750 --> 16:39.750
I think I'm going blind!

16:42.000 --> 16:43.792
-Oh! Flaming hairballs!
-Look out!

16:53.875 --> 16:56.208
(grunting)

17:04.709 --> 17:07.375
(Ryan) Okay, guys, it's too hard
to fight that thing in the air!

17:07.458 --> 17:09.959
We have to bring it down or else we're
gonna get our butts kicked!

17:10.041 --> 17:12.583
What about that grippy-thing-thing
that pulls it in?

17:12.667 --> 17:14.583
Oh, yeah, the grippy thingy!

17:14.667 --> 17:16.208
I did not agree to call it
"the grippy thing."

17:16.291 --> 17:18.875
Mark! Hey, grappling grip!

17:18.959 --> 17:20.000
I can live with that.

17:28.875 --> 17:31.583
Reeling it in!

17:31.667 --> 17:33.792
-Huh?
-(Jaguarsaur growls)

17:33.875 --> 17:35.083
(screams)

17:36.166 --> 17:37.333
(All)
Oh!

17:37.417 --> 17:39.875
(screaming)

17:41.667 --> 17:44.709
(grappling grip clicks)

17:46.375 --> 17:48.834
-We're not out the woods yet.
-You know what time it is.

17:48.917 --> 17:50.792
Plasma punch!

18:01.083 --> 18:03.291
-Whoo! That's right!
-Who's bad?

18:03.375 --> 18:04.583
This is our house!

18:06.041 --> 18:08.250
Aw, man,
Principal Grey got away.

18:08.333 --> 18:11.458
Yeah, well, on the bright side,
she's the only one who knows

18:11.542 --> 18:13.458
I have 22 detentions racked up.

18:13.542 --> 18:14.834
Hey, wait, she knows
who we are.

18:14.917 --> 18:16.583
-She's still a threat.
-No, doubt it.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.375
Capturing us and the robot
was her last chance

18:18.458 --> 18:19.917
with this leader she reports to.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.166
We took 'em down
and you figured out

18:22.250 --> 18:23.542
a new way to use your power, dude.

18:23.625 --> 18:25.792
Come on, take a win.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.083
Yeah.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.417
Yeah, let's go home.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.083
-(door closing)
-(Grace) Mark? Ryan?

18:39.166 --> 18:40.375
Oh, no, just Ryan.

18:40.458 --> 18:41.792
Mark's out with friends.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.834
Ryan. We were
just talking about you.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.500
Sit down, Ryan.

18:49.583 --> 18:52.709
I thought it was time for a little
parent-teacher conference.

18:53.709 --> 18:55.792
Your principal tells me
your grades have been slipping

18:55.875 --> 18:58.125
and you've been cutting class.
That doesn't sound like you.

18:58.208 --> 19:00.333
I thought your mom should know.

19:00.417 --> 19:01.875
Thanks for stopping by.

19:01.959 --> 19:03.291
You need help finding the door?

19:03.375 --> 19:04.500
Ryan!

19:04.583 --> 19:06.291
It's okay, Grace.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.709
I remember what it's like
to be young.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.792
Just wanting to rebel
against anything,

19:11.875 --> 19:14.208
act tough, be cool.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.583
-(chuckles)
-(phone chirps)

19:16.625 --> 19:18.208
-(loud scrape)
-Oh...

19:21.500 --> 19:24.667
Uh, sorry, it's a...
a work thing.

19:24.750 --> 19:27.709
My food truck is catering
a cowboy-themed bar mitzvah.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.917
-Oh, please, take it.
-So not done talking about this, okay?

19:34.917 --> 19:36.834
-It is so nice to see you here.
-Mm.

19:36.917 --> 19:39.333
Saves me the trouble of hunting
you down and kicking your butt...

19:39.417 --> 19:40.417
again.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.542
Now that you've
ruined everything,

19:42.625 --> 19:44.625
my employer wants
to eliminate me.

19:44.709 --> 19:46.750
Oh, I'm real sorry about that.

19:46.834 --> 19:49.875
You know, I hear Antarctica
is really nice this time of year.

19:49.959 --> 19:51.083
Bring a coat.

19:51.166 --> 19:53.250
There is nowhere
I can hide.

19:53.417 --> 19:56.667
The leader plans to devastate
this entire planet.

19:57.750 --> 20:00.250
Now that he's turned on me,

20:00.333 --> 20:02.250
I need you
to help me stop him.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.375
(scoffs)
Wait, me?

20:04.458 --> 20:05.792
I'm not doing anything with you.

20:07.417 --> 20:09.375
Did you not hear
what I just said?

20:09.458 --> 20:12.834
He is going to destroy
everyone and everything.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.667
Your mom, your brother,

20:16.750 --> 20:18.500
your stupid little friends.

20:20.041 --> 20:21.834
Do you really want that?

20:34.333 --> 20:36.417
(theme music playing)

20:58.667 --> 21:00.000
(barking)
