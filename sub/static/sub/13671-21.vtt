WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:02.480
'Previously on St Elsewhere...'

00:02.480 --> 00:04.480
The City has decided
to sell St Eligius.

00:04.480 --> 00:05.840
We're on the auction block.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.280
A health maintenance organisation
like yours

00:08.280 --> 00:10.600
could operate St Eligius
very profitably.

00:10.600 --> 00:14.600
The HMO is sending someone up
from Baltimore to take inventory.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.600
I wonder what they've got
in store for us.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.480
Who would want to buy a
pig in the poke like St Eligius?

00:20.480 --> 00:22.840
The people of this hospital
will put themselves

00:22.840 --> 00:24.280
on the line to save this place.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.320
I'm going to sell.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.800
I suggest you start
looking for another job.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.360
It's final then.
The city has sold the hospital

00:30.360 --> 00:32.080
to Magna-Fujiyama Incorporated.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.080
They promised to preserve the
essential character of St Eligius.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.760
Hey, Jose! Where did you
learn to swab a deck?

02:23.760 --> 02:25.320
On the good ship Lollipop?

02:25.320 --> 02:27.960
You push the mop in front of you
and then before you draw it back,

02:27.960 --> 02:31.320
flip it over so you're always
working with a clean surface.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.680
It wouldn't hurt to have clean water
in the bucket, right?

02:34.680 --> 02:38.280
This place needs to look
spick and span for Ebenezer Wright -

02:38.280 --> 02:40.080
our liaison with Magna-Fujiyama.

02:40.080 --> 02:42.720
See, just push it out,
flip it over, then you

02:42.720 --> 02:44.760
pull it back with a clean surface.

02:44.760 --> 02:48.160
Oh, for crying out loud, lard butt!
I just mopped there.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.400
Forgive me, I'm on a quest
for Mark Craig.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.680
Erm...

02:51.680 --> 02:53.600
Mr Wright...

02:53.600 --> 02:55.800
No Mr, please. Call me Eb.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.080
You know, ever since the city
sold St Eligius

02:58.080 --> 03:00.680
to your health maintenance
organisation, our staff

03:00.680 --> 03:02.400
has been hopping from foot to foot.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.480
There's anxiety about the speech
you're going to make today.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.960
I can understand why but once
we see which way the wind's blowing,

03:08.960 --> 03:12.040
we'll be able to unleash
the falcon and see where it soars.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.240
Uh-huh...

03:13.240 --> 03:14.960
Who's going to clean up the mess?

03:14.960 --> 03:17.040
This is a metaphysical bird
we're flipping here.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.160
Oh, right!

03:18.160 --> 03:19.640
No, call me Eb.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.840
Erm...visitor's pass.

03:21.840 --> 03:25.840
VIP visitor's pass.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.520
Aeroplanes always freak my sinuses.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.200
Listen, Eb, did you get
a chance to look over

03:33.200 --> 03:36.320
the staffing and patient
projections I sent over?

03:36.320 --> 03:38.720
It's a needless act.
Paper's so much pulp.

03:38.720 --> 03:42.000
I intend to walk the halls
and from the feelings I sense,

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
I'll be able to understand the
direction St Eligius will take.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.120
I think there's a great future
here for all of us.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.760
The future is built upon the past.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.000
Whoa!

03:54.000 --> 03:56.440
Something the matter?

03:56.440 --> 04:00.440
Strong vibes. Very strange.

04:09.040 --> 04:13.040
Dr Auschlander. I give you the womb.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
A protective receptacle for
the regeneration of the species.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.640
May all who enter here feel safe.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.080
We need to talk.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.840
Probably routine maintenance.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.840
Let's take the staircase
to Dr Westphall's office.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.720
The climb is good for us.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.720
Confused relationships.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.440
I thought you and Roberta
worked out your problems.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.160
I wish. "Do this, do that.
Go there, stay here."

04:42.160 --> 04:45.440
Whenever someone tells me how
to run my life, I rear back.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.920
Try being taken for granted.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.040
How about being called a
jackass over the hospital PA system?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.560
I can still hear the snickering.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.280
She has no idea
what I do for a living.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.760
That's what happens when
you have nothing in common.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.480
Like her insisting on an
appearance at the fund-raiser

04:58.480 --> 05:00.040
after the kind of day
we put in today.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.360
Exactly! This relationship
is a big mistake.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.440
Like Napoleon's invasion of Russia
and the Watergate tapes.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.800
Not exactly true. She's a funny,
intelligent, sexy woman.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.640
Not exactly true. She's a funny,
intelligent, sexy woman.

05:10.640 --> 05:11.760
Worth a try.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.800
Craig says, "Once you're stuck,
you are stuck for good."

05:14.800 --> 05:16.720
What Craig thinks? It's not his life.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.800
You're right, man. That does it.
I'm going home to tell her.

05:19.800 --> 05:20.960
Tonight's the night.

05:20.960 --> 05:21.520
My mind's made up.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.600
My mind's made up.

05:22.600 --> 05:26.600
I'm getting divorced.
I'm getting married.

05:29.320 --> 05:33.320
Still huffing and puffing
from that trek upstairs.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.520
I thought selling the
St Eligius was just a rumour.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.120
No, they're treating
this like a cabaret.

05:42.120 --> 05:45.680
Is your relaxed attitude
typical of Magna-Fujiyama?

05:45.680 --> 05:49.680
Unfortunately, no. They've come
to rely on my hospital evaluation.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.560
They find my aura very pure.
This room, I can dig it.

05:53.560 --> 05:57.560
Peace, calm...wisdom.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.880
You've got one hell of a
nerve sticking your face

06:02.880 --> 06:05.120
in people's business -
family business.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.760
You beat up your son, O'Connor.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.960
What goes on between me and
my boys is no concern of yours!

06:09.960 --> 06:12.920
You smashed his nose, you broke
his ribs, he lost a kidney.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.320
You're lucky he didn't die.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.520
I know people like you.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.160
You think you're special,
better than people like me.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.480
Let me tell you, I love my boys.
What we've got, you can't touch.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.400
I've been a good father
since their mother died.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.240
Ain't a day gone by
they haven't had clean clothes

06:25.240 --> 06:26.760
and a decent meal
and it ain't been easy.

06:26.760 --> 06:30.760
I grew up with people like you.
I know how tough it's been for you.

06:30.800 --> 06:34.480
You're not be only one in this world
that ever lost a job or a wife.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.760
You talk about love
and family and respect.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.440
You don't even know what
the hell those words mean.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.920
All you know is you're angry.
You have to hit people.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.000
The sickest part is,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.960
you take it out on the people
you supposedly care about.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.800
Shove that dime store shrink talk!

06:47.800 --> 06:49.880
I hate people like you,
you know that?

06:49.880 --> 06:52.680
I'm tell you right now.
I'll do everything in my power

06:52.680 --> 06:55.320
to stop you from doing
any more damage to that boy.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.360
You jerk!

06:56.360 --> 06:58.760
You want to swing on me?
You want to hit me?

06:58.760 --> 07:01.360
Wouldn't you feel a little
more comfortable

07:01.360 --> 07:02.240
with a baseball bat?

07:02.240 --> 07:04.480
I learned to fight the same
place you did, pally boy.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.120
There's nothing I'd like better
right now than to tear you apart.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.160
Erm, I don't mean to bother you.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.480
The staff meeting, where, when?

07:12.480 --> 07:16.480
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.600
Jack, I got a call
from Paul Lockner.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.720
He's my counterpart
over at Porter General.

07:23.720 --> 07:24.920
I'm being traded.

07:24.920 --> 07:28.640
I'm afraid it's bad news, Jack.
Your wife has had an accident.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.720
An accident!

07:31.720 --> 07:35.400
Nina's dead, Jack.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.040
What?

07:37.040 --> 07:41.040
&lt; I can't tell you how sorry I am.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.240
What happened?

07:43.240 --> 07:46.880
Well, I'm...not sure of the details.

07:46.880 --> 07:50.880
Paul said she suffered a massive
cerebral haemorrhage from a fall.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.200
Where is she?

07:52.200 --> 07:56.200
She's still at Porter General.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.720
I want to see her.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.320
Why don't you let me drive you?

07:59.320 --> 08:00.680
No. You've got things to do.

08:00.680 --> 08:01.360
It's no trouble, Jack.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.960
It's no trouble, Jack.

08:04.960 --> 08:08.240
No, I have to see Nina.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.360
Oh, and I got to pick up the baby.

08:11.360 --> 08:15.360
Nina said she'd bring...
she had to work.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.840
She started back at the newspaper
last week, you know.

08:19.840 --> 08:21.960
Jack, sit down for a second.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.320
No, I should be going.

08:23.320 --> 08:26.760
Let me drive you.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.880
I'm fine.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.640
Really.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.240
Um...

08:34.240 --> 08:36.840
I'll need to get someone
to cover for me.

08:36.840 --> 08:40.840
I'll take care of it.

08:41.320 --> 08:45.320
I promise, this is not...

08:50.800 --> 08:53.520
So, she wants the wedding
to be Greek Orthodox?

08:53.520 --> 08:55.800
Shut up! You're the only
person I've told.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.720
Besides, there's nothing
orthodox about either of us.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.960
This party should celebrate
a relationship.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.120
Not our families getting
rid of an old maid.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.720
Luther, I'm telling you.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.160
He came to my apartment. He was in
the same room with my family.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.200
Go to the cops.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.640
What do I tell them?
He hasn't done anything yet.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.560
By the time he does,
it'll be too late.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.280
I think Detective Zito's
kind of cute.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.560
He's Italian too.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.120
Make my mum happy.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.200
He's too young for your mother.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.920
Anyway, the police aren't here for
the benefit of your social life.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.280
We have a mercy killer
running around.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.760
What are you looking for?

09:28.760 --> 09:31.720
Roxanne, I don't want her
to see me if I don't have to.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.880
Not bridging those troubled waters?

09:33.880 --> 09:37.240
Believe me, never fall in love
with people who you work with.

09:37.240 --> 09:41.240
Don't worry, I'm not that stupid.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.800
Is this thing on?
Today's a red letter day

09:46.800 --> 09:49.440
in the hallowed halls of St Eligius.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.080
A representative of
Magna-Fujiyama Incorporated -

09:52.080 --> 09:55.320
known throughout this country
for their quality health care

09:55.320 --> 09:57.800
and fine transistor radios -

09:57.800 --> 10:01.800
is here to give us an overview
of the company plans.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.720
So, without much ado,

10:04.720 --> 10:08.720
the vice-president of medical
facilities, Ebenezer B Wright.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.560
Eb, call me Eb.

10:12.560 --> 10:16.560
As I look around this room here,
I like what I see. Wavy gravy.

10:16.800 --> 10:20.800
A meal you can really
sink your teeth into.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.760
MAN SCREAMS, GLASS SMASHES

10:24.760 --> 10:26.480
Oh no, he's still here.

10:26.480 --> 10:27.640
What's the matter?

10:27.640 --> 10:29.840
This guy asked for spaghetti
and meat sauce.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.040
I tell him it's cold.
He says, "I don't care."

10:32.040 --> 10:33.520
I give him it. He goes bananas.

10:33.520 --> 10:36.320
This sauce has garlic in it.
I can't eat garlic.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.280
All spaghetti sauce
has garlic in it.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.960
Vampires can't stand the stuff.

10:39.960 --> 10:43.960
Help me, Dr Axelrod,
please. I beg you.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.680
I'm slowly losing the power
of reason. I can't help myself.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.440
Stop me!

10:49.440 --> 10:53.440
Stop me before I need to suck blood
from some poor, unsuspecting damsel.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.600
Get this guy up to psych
and admit him. He's your patient.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.280
Can't we just dump him
on the street somewhere

10:59.280 --> 11:00.680
or give him spaghetti with no sauce?

11:00.680 --> 11:04.680
Take it easy. Dr Axelrod is going
to take very good care of you.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.640
Why me? Why is it always me?

11:13.640 --> 11:16.640
It is cool that you're all
terrified that the concerns

11:16.640 --> 11:20.080
of a large corporation will change
the spirit of St Eligius.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.720
To be perfectly up front,
I want you people to know

11:22.720 --> 11:25.640
there are a lot of dead heads -
I don't mean Jerry Garcia -

11:25.640 --> 11:27.400
on the board of Magna-Fujiyama,

11:27.400 --> 11:30.400
who're pretty bummed out
behind this purchase.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.960
What I want you to know,
I'm your biggest fan.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.560
I really believe in what
you do here.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.120
In conclusion,
I'd like to say that...

11:39.120 --> 11:43.120
My chest is about to explode.

11:43.880 --> 11:44.920
Oh!

11:44.920 --> 11:46.280
He's blue.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.880
I'm a bit depressed myself.

11:47.880 --> 11:51.880
There's no pulse.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.760
Watch your backs!

11:54.760 --> 11:58.760
Coming through!

12:02.480 --> 12:06.480
CAR TOOTS HORN

12:17.640 --> 12:19.640
Can I get a hand here?

12:19.640 --> 12:21.160
Can I get a hand?

12:21.160 --> 12:25.160
He collapsed in the cafeteria.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.640
Got him back to normal
sinus rhythm...

12:27.640 --> 12:29.680
Still complaining of
severe chest pains.

12:29.680 --> 12:32.480
Get a 12 lead. CVC. Phil, gases.
Boomer, lights.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.120
Elliott, you just try
and stay out of the way.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.360
Sir, have you ever felt
pain like this before?

12:38.360 --> 12:42.360
Yeah, where were you?
August 8th, 1985.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.720
Get out of here...!

12:45.720 --> 12:47.520
Can you help me a second?

12:47.520 --> 12:49.320
I got it.

12:49.320 --> 12:50.520
Whose tail is this?

12:50.520 --> 12:51.640
It's big Snoopy's.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.160
And who are you?

12:52.160 --> 12:54.640
And who are you?

12:54.640 --> 12:55.720
This is an Emergency Room.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.360
It's an emergency!
Do you want thousands of kids

12:58.360 --> 13:01.640
to watch Big Snoopy die a slow death
on national television?

13:01.640 --> 13:02.920
Yeah!

13:02.920 --> 13:06.320
Daniels, Snoopy suture, stat.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.760
How is he?

13:08.760 --> 13:11.120
Not responding to morphine
and IV Nitro.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.720
EKG shows lateral ST elevations.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.560
I'll get the cath team ready.

13:15.560 --> 13:16.840
Why?

13:16.840 --> 13:20.840
The sun sets on us all.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.360
This isn't Stephen.

13:23.360 --> 13:27.360
This isn't my son.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.000
It's not him, Mark.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.240
Mark, we have to go
and find Stephen.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.680
If he's hurt,
you'll be able to help him.

13:35.680 --> 13:39.680
Valium, 10 milligrams, IM.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.840
Helen, it's not him.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.120
You know Stephen, he's handsome.

13:48.120 --> 13:52.120
My son has gorgeous green eyes
and he has hair that keeps falling

13:53.000 --> 13:55.600
on his face. His father
teases him all the time

13:55.600 --> 13:58.720
about getting a haircut.

13:58.720 --> 14:02.720
He left from our house tonight.
He's on his way to Columbus.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.840
He's a resident at OSU.

14:07.840 --> 14:10.440
Let's find some place
where we can talk.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.440
He's my only child! (SOBS)
He wouldn't leave me.

14:19.240 --> 14:23.240
Geodesic domes,
Whole Earth catalogues.

14:23.480 --> 14:27.480
Free Bobby and Huey
and Dewey and Louie...

14:28.960 --> 14:32.280
That's getting you talking!
You'd better turn it down.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.880
Can you hear that sound?

14:34.880 --> 14:36.960
Can you hear the music?

14:36.960 --> 14:40.960
It's a simple melody
of the butt horn!

14:42.760 --> 14:44.960
Which way are you headed?

14:44.960 --> 14:46.840
Up.

14:46.840 --> 14:50.840
Up! Well, I think you're going
to enjoy my next number. Hit it!

14:53.080 --> 14:56.040
# What goes up must come down

14:56.040 --> 14:59.600
# Spinning wheel got to go round

14:59.600 --> 15:03.600
# Talking 'bout your troubles
It's a crying sin

15:04.200 --> 15:08.200
# Ride a painted pony
Let the spinning wheel spin... #

15:11.480 --> 15:15.480
Oh! I forgot something
in the on-call room.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.720
Oh, sorry to wake you, Elliott.

15:18.720 --> 15:22.720
That's OK.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.360
BEEPING

16:24.920 --> 16:26.920
Hello?

16:26.920 --> 16:30.920
Hello?!

17:01.360 --> 17:04.720
MOUSE SQUEAKS

17:04.720 --> 17:08.720
ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYS

18:00.760 --> 18:04.760
GUITAR CONTINUES

18:08.240 --> 18:12.240
GUITAR VOLUME INCREASES

18:13.480 --> 18:15.320
No...

18:15.320 --> 18:18.840
No, no, no, no... No!
(SHOUTS) No!

18:18.840 --> 18:22.840
I hear old voices like
an Indian burial ground.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.400
Let me check your abdomen, Mrs...

18:27.400 --> 18:31.400
Ah! You lay a finger on me, butch,
I'll be calling Miami Vice.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.760
Nursing, my new career.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.240
I can't stand it.
The patients never shut up.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.560
"My back aches. The coffee was cold.
My tray's not right."

18:39.560 --> 18:41.600
Was it a big deal
to fluff my pillow?

18:41.600 --> 18:42.720
I'm not talking to you!

18:42.720 --> 18:45.560
The nurses went on strike cos
they don't like doing scud either.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.360
But they do it better than him!

18:47.360 --> 18:48.640
Lighten up, would you?

18:48.640 --> 18:52.000
I've had patients spit pills at me,
call me names. Throw up on me.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.320
It was only a little phlegm.

18:53.320 --> 18:56.080
Look, Dr Paul was called
out of town.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.720
I've been assigned to your case.
I'm Dr Chandler.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.240
You're my new doctor?

19:00.240 --> 19:01.000
Yes, ma'am.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.120
Yes, ma'am.

19:02.120 --> 19:06.080
Good morning, Mrs Huffnagel.
You're going to be OK.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.680
Don't you come near me.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.280
This man has tried to kill me
with rat poison.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.000
It was phenyl butezone
for her phlebitis.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.040
Rat poison!

19:14.040 --> 19:15.720
You're going down to X-ray.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.560
You'll be getting a barium enema.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.200
N-O!

19:20.200 --> 19:21.960
Nobody touches the booty.

19:21.960 --> 19:25.960
The thing I can't figure out is how
they can let you run a hospital.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.680
What do you mean?

19:27.680 --> 19:28.880
You're a jinx!

19:28.880 --> 19:29.640
Mrs Huffnagel...

19:29.640 --> 19:32.800
Mrs Huffnagel...

19:32.800 --> 19:35.840
Auschlander's about ready
to kick the bucket.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.040
Morrison got his degree
from a Crackerjack box

19:39.040 --> 19:43.040
and behind those sensible wrinkles,
your life's a mess.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.320
You have an aneurysm.

19:46.320 --> 19:50.240
It's a weakening in the wall of the
heart and it's extremely dangerous.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.320
I don't care if you did win

19:52.320 --> 19:56.320
the Cushing Left Anterior
Descending Artery Award...

19:56.680 --> 19:58.000
How do you know I won an award?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.760
How do you know I won an award?

20:00.760 --> 20:02.480
What were you doing in my office?

20:02.480 --> 20:05.000
I'm surprised they let you keep them

20:05.000 --> 20:07.240
after Eve Lighton's
heart went back to Nina.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.880
Ah, you Greeks are sure
a distrustful lot.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.320
Cradle of democracy, my eye!

20:13.320 --> 20:17.080
Don't tell me that Onassis
wasn't trying to make a run

20:17.080 --> 20:21.080
for the White House
by marrying Jackie.

20:28.880 --> 20:32.200
Anything for a laugh, huh,
Miss Huffnagel?

20:32.200 --> 20:36.200
Miss Huffnagel?

20:36.680 --> 20:39.040
Miss Huffnagel!

20:39.040 --> 20:42.000
Damn!

20:42.000 --> 20:43.680
Don't raise the bed, OK?

20:43.680 --> 20:46.480
I'm just checking your
blood pressure.

20:46.480 --> 20:50.480
Everyone gets the same treatment
here, don't they?

20:52.280 --> 20:55.840
But I told you they're going to
take pictures of my feet, didn't I?

20:55.840 --> 20:56.720
Yeah.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.640
So, what?
You're making a big to-do

20:58.640 --> 21:00.840
and upsetting everybody
and everything.

21:00.840 --> 21:01.880
I forgot.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.520
You'd forget your head if it
wasn't screwed on.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.720
Yeah.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.080
Where were you, anyway?

21:09.080 --> 21:12.520
I went to the shelter. I went to
look for Frank. He owes me a dollar.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.600
Did he pay you?

21:13.600 --> 21:14.800
He said, maybe tomorrow.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.000
Yeah, sure.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.240
Who smacked you?

21:18.240 --> 21:20.080
Huh?

21:20.080 --> 21:24.080
Who smacked you?
You've got a big thing on your head.

21:24.560 --> 21:28.560
That div, Charlie,
hit me with a bottle.

21:28.560 --> 21:32.560
Don't you have the sense to run?

21:32.720 --> 21:34.480
It didn't hurt much.

21:34.480 --> 21:37.760
They take your blood.

21:37.760 --> 21:41.760
They put it in bottles
and they sell it, Corey.

21:44.880 --> 21:48.880
It's not blood, Arnie.
That's medicine.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.200
Doctor said I'm very sick, Arnie.

21:55.200 --> 21:59.200
The doctor said my feet
got to be cut off.

22:00.640 --> 22:04.640
The feet are dead and they're
just poisoning my legs.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.120
This is what they do, Corey.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.440
This is what they do.

22:11.440 --> 22:15.280
No, it's not the hospital's fault.

22:15.280 --> 22:18.120
I could have run from Charlie.

22:18.120 --> 22:22.120
I could have run.

22:24.120 --> 22:27.280
Corey, Corey, please let's go home.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.880
I'll soak your feet.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.760
I'll take care of you.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.040
Please, Corey, please.
Let's go home.

22:34.040 --> 22:38.040
They're going to cut off my feet!

22:38.680 --> 22:41.160
Don't you understand anything?

22:41.160 --> 22:45.120
You can't go running around
like a chicken without a head

22:45.120 --> 22:47.720
because I can't chase
after you no more.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.400
I could have run.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.000
Oh!

22:51.000 --> 22:52.600
I could have run.

22:52.600 --> 22:56.600
Oh!

23:21.240 --> 23:25.240
Corey?

23:25.440 --> 23:28.240
Corey!

23:28.240 --> 23:32.240
Corey!

23:58.040 --> 24:02.040
Corey! Corey!

24:05.080 --> 24:09.080
Corey!

24:09.080 --> 24:13.080
Corey...

24:19.360 --> 24:20.880
Corey!

24:20.880 --> 24:24.880
HE CRIES IN FEAR

24:48.080 --> 24:50.520
Hey, Arnie, hey! &gt;

24:50.520 --> 24:54.520
Arnie, it's OK. It's OK. It's OK. &gt;

24:54.960 --> 24:58.960
Everything's OK. It's OK. &gt;

25:05.240 --> 25:08.400
Come on, come on.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.800
It's OK.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.920
Corey.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.080
Everything's OK.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.080
Corey.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.040
COREY!

25:19.040 --> 25:23.040
COREY!

25:30.920 --> 25:33.760
Mr Wright was presented

25:33.760 --> 25:36.880
in ventricular tachycardia
with unstable angina.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.240
A bypass is indicated.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.360
He's chosen to skip surgery.

25:40.360 --> 25:44.160
I'm not being cavalier about this.
This incarnation has run its course.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.400
It's time to change channels.

25:45.400 --> 25:49.080
It's a matter of attitude, Eb.
Be merry.

25:49.080 --> 25:53.080
Then you're going
to make it after all.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.920
Sue Anne!

25:57.920 --> 25:59.720
Sue Anne!

25:59.720 --> 26:01.120
The Happy Homemaker.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.240
I'm afraid you have me confused
with someone else.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.160
I'm Mary.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.480
You know?

26:08.480 --> 26:10.160
Mary!

26:10.160 --> 26:14.120
Sorry.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.360
Mrs Wright, if your husband
doesn't follow our instructions,

26:17.360 --> 26:19.760
it's very likely that his next
heart attack will kill him.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.360
I'm so glad Eb is here.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.280
He was really looking
forward to visiting you.

26:24.280 --> 26:27.240
I'm confident you'll
do everything to help him.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.480
Mrs Wright!

26:28.480 --> 26:29.680
Call me Marley.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.200
It's very important
that you convince your husband

26:32.200 --> 26:33.880
that this surgery is necessary.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.920
It won't be easy.

26:35.920 --> 26:39.920
Yeah, I know.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.160
It's time you started chemotherapy.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.440
I'm feeling all right, Donald.
Really I am.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.880
You collapsed in
the middle of rounds.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.800
I'm not a child to be
clucked over and cared for.

26:51.800 --> 26:55.720
I'm not an invalid to be
whispered about behind my back.

26:55.720 --> 26:56.160
Daniel!

26:56.160 --> 26:59.200
Daniel!

26:59.200 --> 27:02.600
Please have the decency
to pay me that respect.

27:02.600 --> 27:06.600
I've treated hundreds
of cases like mine before.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.920
Do you think maybe,
in this case,

27:10.920 --> 27:13.360
your vision might be
a little clouded?

27:13.360 --> 27:16.840
I'm as strong as I ever was.

27:16.840 --> 27:20.400
As alert. And as capable.

27:20.400 --> 27:24.400
No one's doubting that.

27:25.560 --> 27:29.360
Look, I appreciate your concern.

27:29.360 --> 27:33.360
I know it's terrifying. I know that.

27:41.080 --> 27:45.080
I can face the pain
that goes with the injections.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.640
The fever, the nausea and the
diarrhoea that goes along with

27:49.640 --> 27:53.640
chemotherapy. What I hate is that
as chemotherapy kills the cancer...

27:57.160 --> 28:01.160
I will grow weaker and weaker.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.920
You saw me on the
tennis court this morning.

28:03.920 --> 28:07.680
I played as well as ever - better.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.520
I'm not ready to put
my life in mothballs.

28:10.520 --> 28:14.520
What man wants to cease
to function as he chooses?

28:15.720 --> 28:19.720
What man wants to hand himself
over to such a life?

28:22.400 --> 28:26.400
The bottom line, my friend, is that
chemotherapy will buy you time.

28:27.080 --> 28:31.080
Advantage, Westphall.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.160
I'll do it.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.200
Excuse me.

28:44.200 --> 28:48.040
I think the Wrights
should be left alone.

28:48.040 --> 28:48.560
Honey!

28:48.560 --> 28:51.880
Honey!

28:51.880 --> 28:53.480
Spank the monkey?

28:53.480 --> 28:55.440
Oh, ducky!

28:55.440 --> 28:59.440
I'm puzzled by your behaviour.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.320
I do crosswords in pen.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.720
Do I look like someone
who needs help?

29:04.720 --> 29:07.360
Yes, come on. Try me.

29:07.360 --> 29:11.360
All right.
23 across, eight letters.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.920
Plastic silverware.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.920
Oh, oxymoron.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.920
A rhetorical figure in which
contradictory terms are combined.

29:20.880 --> 29:24.880
10 across, a named gadget
or trinket - six letters.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.240
Quawor.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.240
How do you spell that?

29:32.240 --> 29:34.640
Q-U-A-W-O-R.

29:34.640 --> 29:38.280
Yeah, that's what the Aboriginal
tribes of Borneo use for barter.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.360
Oh my, that's a scary place, Borneo.

29:40.360 --> 29:43.240
I lost a lot more there than
traveller's cheques.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.280
&lt; A little less.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.320
&lt; I said less, not green!
Don't you know the difference?

29:48.320 --> 29:50.200
Get up and fix the thing yourself.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.520
&lt; What's the matter with you?
I'm in a tent.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.560
&lt; I'm sick. You know that,
don't you?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.760
Your legs aren't broken.

29:56.760 --> 29:58.680
&lt; You're doing it again.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.800
Do you want me to leave?

30:00.800 --> 30:03.440
&lt; I'm telling you to leave.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.240
Wait a minute. First, put the TV
set back on and fix the colour.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.720
Good morning!

30:07.720 --> 30:11.720
I won't. I'll just go.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.200
How you feeling this
morning, Mr Milstein?

30:13.200 --> 30:14.520
Not good.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.480
Not good.

30:16.480 --> 30:20.080
Mr Millstein, I want you in your room
in an hour for pre-op medication.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.200
Is it going to hurt?

30:21.200 --> 30:24.800
Is it going to hurt? Listen to him,
I'm sick and he's complaining.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.800
Get off my back!

30:26.800 --> 30:28.440
Have you two always been like this?

30:28.440 --> 30:29.840
He's still mad about the time...

30:29.840 --> 30:30.920
Don't say it.

30:30.920 --> 30:33.560
It's true! You're still mad
about Niagara Falls.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.520
That's it. I'm going to teach him
a lesson.

30:35.520 --> 30:36.600
How do I get out of this?

30:36.600 --> 30:38.080
Take it easy now.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.280
I'll get leached.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.440
I'll go to Mexico and I'll eat
apricot pits

30:41.440 --> 30:43.120
but I'm not going to go through
with this.

30:43.120 --> 30:46.600
Let's call it off. Unzip the tent!
I don't want his damn bone marrow!

30:46.600 --> 30:49.760
Your brother is making
a big sacrifice for you.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.440
Yeah.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.960
Yeah.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.320
Yeah... It will?

30:54.320 --> 30:57.400
This is a risky business but I'm a
Top Gun and we'll cruise through.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.000
Put him under.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.800
My legs hurt.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.520
Get over here, Ehrlich.

31:04.520 --> 31:07.720
Victor Ehrlich?

31:07.720 --> 31:08.800
Thank you, sir.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.800
Could somebody take this?

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
Testicular cancer isn't a
joking matter for a man your age,
Dr Ehrlich.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.360
Do you examine yourself once a month?

31:21.360 --> 31:23.720
No.

31:23.720 --> 31:27.720
You should.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.080
Not now, Ehrlich.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.640
Yes, sir.

31:33.640 --> 31:37.640
Upstairs, when I was convincing
Ebenezer to have his operation,

31:39.080 --> 31:43.080
I had to make him understand
that life is just too beautiful

31:44.440 --> 31:48.440
to miss one multicoloured moment.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.320
I can attest.

31:53.320 --> 31:56.960
I told him we should
see our daughters grow.

31:56.960 --> 32:00.960
And our house with
two cats in the yard.

32:01.680 --> 32:05.680
Life used to be so hard.

32:05.760 --> 32:09.720
Besides, he only needs
two more years to qualify

32:09.720 --> 32:11.600
for the pension plan.

32:11.600 --> 32:15.600
Are you going to be all right down
here while the surgery's going on?

32:15.680 --> 32:18.520
Yes.

32:18.520 --> 32:22.520
You know, we've been
agnostic since '69.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.880
I never told Eb,

32:24.880 --> 32:28.880
but I kept this.

32:29.800 --> 32:32.920
You know, I think that,
in any other circumstances,

32:32.920 --> 32:35.520
you and I would probably
get along very well.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.320
Yeah.

32:37.320 --> 32:40.400
I don't think our views
on life are very different.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.680
Only our views on death.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.720
I know Sister Teresa's
going to a better place.

32:44.720 --> 32:48.720
You see, I don't even
believe in an afterlife.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.560
All I trust in is the here and now.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.760
When did you stop believing?

32:53.760 --> 32:55.480
When you became a doctor?

32:55.480 --> 32:59.480
No, it was a long while after that.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.840
My wife was in an accident -

33:01.840 --> 33:03.880
I call it an accident.

33:03.880 --> 33:07.880
The Church would call it
part of a greater plan.

33:08.520 --> 33:12.520
In any case, Maureen ended
up lying in a hospital bed

33:12.920 --> 33:16.040
and the only thing that told me
she was still alive

33:16.040 --> 33:20.040
was an electronic impulse
on a monitor.

33:20.400 --> 33:24.400
We had two small children and I was
scared. I didn't know what to do.

33:26.040 --> 33:30.040
So, I went to our parish priest and
he responded the same way you did.

33:31.240 --> 33:35.240
I put her life in God's hands
and I lost her.

33:36.680 --> 33:40.680
At the time, that seemed right.
I even grew to accept it.

33:41.680 --> 33:45.520
But in the years since then,
I've seen case after hopeless case,

33:45.520 --> 33:49.440
where patients, because of one
doctor's faith in medicine,

33:49.440 --> 33:51.440
came back to life.

33:51.440 --> 33:55.440
So, you see, the question that
keeps eating away at me is, why?

33:59.920 --> 34:03.920
Why was I so willing
not to trust what I knew?

34:04.280 --> 34:07.280
If I had waited, the only woman
I ever truly loved

34:07.280 --> 34:10.199
might still be here with me.

34:10.199 --> 34:13.679
Sure, if I do say so myself,
I'm doing a Crackerjack job.

34:13.679 --> 34:17.480
Could you start taking Mr Wright
off the bypass machine?

34:17.480 --> 34:21.480
And you stop shooting off
your mouth.

34:21.920 --> 34:25.920
Dr Morgan, read the history, please.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.400
Cause of death, severe head trauma,

34:29.400 --> 34:32.159
resulting in massive
brain haemorrhage.

34:32.159 --> 34:36.159
Admitted Porter General ER
9.17am, time of death 9.30am.

34:36.719 --> 34:40.320
Donor, white, female. Weight 125 lb.

34:40.320 --> 34:44.320
Age 28. Name, Morrison, Nina L.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.800
I should have been there.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.120
Jack! That's...

35:07.120 --> 35:09.480
If I'd been there, none of
this would have happened.

35:09.480 --> 35:10.520
But you weren't.

35:10.520 --> 35:13.880
Yeah. Because I was here.

35:13.880 --> 35:17.760
Like every other morning.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.560
While she was feeding Peter,

35:19.560 --> 35:23.560
getting ready to go to the sitter's,
so she could go to work, I was here.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.400
And for what?

35:27.400 --> 35:29.880
So I could be a big hot shot,
save people's lives.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.520
I couldn't even save my own wife.

35:31.520 --> 35:35.520
Jack, it was not your fault.

35:39.240 --> 35:43.240
She fell in the bathroom and hit
her head. It was a stupid accident.

35:43.960 --> 35:47.960
(SHOUTS) If I'd been there to help,
it would not have happened.

35:49.240 --> 35:53.240
She wouldn't have been running
around doing everything herself

35:53.240 --> 35:57.240
because I could have helped.

35:58.840 --> 36:02.840
I should have been there.

36:04.840 --> 36:06.360
Went better than expected.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.440
Super.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.160
Dr Craig!

36:08.160 --> 36:09.680
Dr Craig!

36:09.680 --> 36:11.760
Once again, St Eligius plucks
someone out of the jaws of death...

36:11.760 --> 36:13.880
Once again, St Eligius plucks
someone out of the jaws of death...

36:13.880 --> 36:15.160
What?

36:15.160 --> 36:16.720
Mr Wright's having a stroke.

36:16.720 --> 36:20.640
Get Neuro down here, stat!

36:20.640 --> 36:22.000
Do you want to take a break?

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
I'd love to.

36:29.160 --> 36:32.440
Sleeping?

36:32.440 --> 36:34.640
You're all working so hard for him.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.360
I really appreciate that.

36:36.360 --> 36:40.360
Dr Craig said the stroke could have
been caused by a number of things -

36:40.480 --> 36:42.920
blood clot in the heart,
brain lesions.

36:42.920 --> 36:46.720
I'm afraid your husband's
got a long way to come back.

36:46.720 --> 36:50.720
Let's go outside and get some air.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
BEEPING

37:38.680 --> 37:39.840
Come on! &gt;

37:39.840 --> 37:43.840
Elliott, this isn't working.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.480
Let's call it.

37:46.480 --> 37:50.000
Are you kidding? Be remembered
as the guy who killed Santa Claus?

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
Clear!

37:57.360 --> 37:59.360
I can see it in the history books
now.

37:59.360 --> 38:03.360
John Wilkes Booth, Sirhan Sirhan
Elliot Axelrod. Not this Jew.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.600
Clear!

38:06.600 --> 38:10.600
BEEPING

38:12.960 --> 38:14.600
Eb's dead.

38:14.600 --> 38:18.600
I'll send him down to the morgue.
I'll break the news to Westlake.

38:20.280 --> 38:22.000
Give my regards to your husband.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.200
Leonard died last spring.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.240
I'm sorry.

38:24.240 --> 38:28.240
He was walking over to Brigham's
with my beautiful Collie, Laddie,

38:28.840 --> 38:31.320
to pick me up a pint of Mocha Chip.

38:31.320 --> 38:34.200
Leonard liked vanilla himself.

38:34.200 --> 38:36.920
A simple man
deserves a simple ice cream.

38:36.920 --> 38:40.800
Coming back, they got
killed by a hit and run car. &gt;

38:40.800 --> 38:44.800
"Hit and run",
that's what the police told me.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.240
You never know.

38:47.240 --> 38:51.240
Now, at least my Laddie
is always with me.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.720
He's stuffed.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.520
SHE KNOCKS

38:56.520 --> 39:00.520
Did you have your husband
stuffed too, Miss Fletcher?

39:00.800 --> 39:04.160
Oh no! I had Leonard cremated.

39:04.160 --> 39:07.360
His ashes are on the mantle
in the living room.

39:07.360 --> 39:11.360
What do you think I am, sick?!

39:15.440 --> 39:17.040
You killed my husband!

39:17.040 --> 39:17.600
My dear!

39:17.600 --> 39:20.640
My dear!

39:20.640 --> 39:21.960
(SHOUTS INAUDIBLY)

39:21.960 --> 39:25.960
(SHOUTS)

39:27.280 --> 39:31.280
My dear!

39:33.080 --> 39:34.680
Seemed like a nice guy.

39:34.680 --> 39:35.760
I try.

39:35.760 --> 39:37.080
What?

39:37.080 --> 39:39.480
I didn't say anything.

39:39.480 --> 39:43.480
THUNDER

39:44.840 --> 39:46.520
Is Doc Fujiago here?

39:46.520 --> 39:49.000
No, he went to the health club.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.160
He was supposed to have the
results on the Nielson autopsy.

39:52.160 --> 39:55.480
The man who died sitting with
his family, watching television?

39:55.480 --> 39:57.760
Yeah.

39:57.760 --> 39:58.800
Here it is.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.800
Thanks.

40:01.800 --> 40:02.880
This is incomplete.

40:02.880 --> 40:03.960
Why?

40:03.960 --> 40:06.720
There's no indication of
which show he was watching.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.400
My guess is cable.

40:08.400 --> 40:10.960
They play all the really
good movies on cable.

40:10.960 --> 40:13.400
I love lying in bed watching.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.920
There are no interruptions.

40:15.920 --> 40:19.920
Aha! Um... Bye, Kath.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.680
Wayne, wait!

40:22.680 --> 40:24.240
THUNDER

40:24.240 --> 40:27.400
Have you ever seen
The French Lieutenant's Woman?

40:27.400 --> 40:29.000
It's on tonight.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.160
I saw it.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.760
Can you ever forget
the look on Meryl's face

40:32.760 --> 40:34.760
when she was standing on the quay.

40:34.760 --> 40:38.760
A lone figure on a windswept car
waiting for her man to return.

40:40.440 --> 40:44.440
And she turned. Jeremy saw her
for the first time.

40:44.520 --> 40:48.240
THUNDER

40:48.240 --> 40:49.720
Wayne, can I be frank?

40:49.720 --> 40:51.320
You can be anybody you want.

40:51.320 --> 40:55.200
Please, I want to bare
my soul to you.

40:55.200 --> 40:59.040
I saw the way you were looking at me
in the cafeteria -

40:59.040 --> 41:01.200
like you used to before.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.280
Oh damn it, Wayne.

41:02.280 --> 41:05.400
Ever since that night when
I walked out of your apartment...

41:05.400 --> 41:08.920
Kathy, you are not interested in me.
You are just obsessed with sex.

41:08.920 --> 41:11.800
THUNDER

41:11.800 --> 41:14.280
Yes, I am.

41:14.280 --> 41:18.280
But only with you, Wayne.
You're better than Tony and David.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.760
And Scott.

41:24.760 --> 41:26.480
And Steve.

41:26.480 --> 41:30.480
Even Gary.

41:30.800 --> 41:34.760
I still wear your heart
close to mine.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.840
Well, look, Kathy, I got to go.

41:36.840 --> 41:37.720
Please don't!

41:37.720 --> 41:40.680
Please don't!

41:40.680 --> 41:43.240
of a very nice relationship
with Shirley Daniels

41:43.240 --> 41:45.800
and anything between us right now
will screw that up.

41:45.800 --> 41:49.800
I don't want to screw that up.
No, Kathy, no, Kathy. Kathy...

41:52.440 --> 41:54.080
Kathy!

41:54.080 --> 41:58.080
Oh...

41:58.960 --> 42:02.920
The day will come when you shall
be called to account

42:02.920 --> 42:06.920
for what you have done to me.

42:20.960 --> 42:24.560
We go to the Corporation directors
and tell them what happened.

42:24.560 --> 42:26.240
We killed the poor man.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.800
Come on, Paulette.
You saw the autopsy report.

42:28.800 --> 42:32.200
Wright was injected with a
lethal dose of potassium chloride.

42:32.200 --> 42:36.200
Obviously by this mercy killer.

42:36.680 --> 42:39.520
He was our only ally
with Magna-Fujiyama.

42:39.520 --> 42:42.040
Mark, you're being very quiet.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.680
You're usually so opinionated.

42:44.680 --> 42:48.000
I'm the one who contacted the HMO.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.720
This is all my fault.

42:51.720 --> 42:55.720
Mrs Huffnagel's death was a direct
result of a surgical error.

42:58.280 --> 43:02.040
&lt; A small nick in the
mitral papillary muscle

43:02.040 --> 43:06.040
&lt; which gradually ruptured
during the post-op period.

43:10.480 --> 43:14.480
In other words, I'm responsible
for Mrs Huffnagel's death.

43:19.480 --> 43:23.480
My father always said, "one life".

43:25.040 --> 43:29.040
One day in that life
is as precious as any other.

43:34.480 --> 43:38.480
We lose patients for a lot of
reasons that we can't control

43:38.480 --> 43:42.480
but when we lose a patient
because of our own ineptitude,

43:44.200 --> 43:48.200
it's unforgivable.

43:51.960 --> 43:54.600
I apologise to you all.

43:54.600 --> 43:58.360
I made a mistake.

43:58.360 --> 44:02.360
I'm sorry.

44:05.520 --> 44:09.520
We'll proceed to the next case.

44:09.560 --> 44:13.560
Dr Cavanero...

44:15.440 --> 44:18.280
Mrs Wright's
going to sue us for malpractice.

44:18.280 --> 44:19.320
Oh, my God!

44:19.320 --> 44:21.440
That's the good news.

44:21.440 --> 44:22.360
&lt; The bad?

44:22.360 --> 44:26.360
&lt; The bad?

44:54.400 --> 45:05.000
