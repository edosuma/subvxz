00:21.388 --> 00:22.554
- Uh, that--

the smartest--

01:52.145 --> 01:54.180
- I did a fixer-upper on some.

And by the time I was finished,

01:54.213 --> 01:56.549

- Why'd you just throw

02:10.530 --> 02:12.650
your phone across the table?

02:12.979 --> 02:13.866
- Because things

02:12.979 --> 02:13.866
aren't going great

02:13.900 --> 02:16.689
with my sneaker business.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.689
- What do you mean?

02:16.102 --> 02:17.403
- I haven't sold one

02:16.102 --> 02:17.403
in a month,

02:17.437 --> 02:19.705
and the one I did sell,

02:17.437 --> 02:19.705
it's getting returned.

02:20.873 --> 02:22.141
- You know, Grayson started

02:22.175 --> 02:24.843
this online business

02:22.175 --> 02:24.843

02:24.877 --> 02:26.780

But starting a business

02:26.812 --> 02:28.848
is not easy.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.216
Why do you think

02:28.882 --> 02:31.216
your business isn't doing well?

02:31.251 --> 02:32.718
- I don't know.

<i>my kids struggle,</i>

02:35.879 --> 02:37.223
but with struggle comes growth.

02:37.257 --> 02:39.658
- And luckily for Grayson,

02:37.257 --> 02:39.658
he has me as his dad,

02:39.692 --> 02:41.728
and I have a lot

02:39.692 --> 02:41.728
of tricks up my sleeve

02:41.760 --> 02:44.296
when it comes to business.

02:44.329 --> 02:45.531
- I mean,

02:44.329 --> 02:45.531
everything was going good

02:45.564 --> 02:47.000
and I set up

02:45.564 --> 02:47.000
my social media accounts

02:47.099 --> 02:49.868
and then everything

02:47.099 --> 02:49.868
just started going downhill.

02:49.902 --> 02:51.638
- And when's the last time

02:49.902 --> 02:51.638
that you posted?

02:51.670 --> 02:52.906
- Like, a week ago?

02:52.938 --> 02:55.307
- You have to be posting

02:52.938 --> 02:55.307
constantly.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.376
- Yeah, at least--

02:55.341 --> 02:56.376
- Once a day.

02:56.408 --> 02:57.811
- Probably once or twice a day

02:57.843 --> 02:59.346
and post on your story.

02:59.378 --> 03:02.649
I mean, I could help you.

03:06.286 --> 03:07.854
- Let's see.

03:07.887 --> 03:11.909
See, like, they're good photos,

03:07.887 --> 03:11.909
but you just need to

03:11.123 --> 03:13.826
pick a theme and how you're

03:11.123 --> 03:13.826
going to showcase each shoe

03:13.860 --> 03:15.794
and keep it consistent.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.365
if I'd have had social media,

03:18.397 --> 03:20.466
I'd have put Heidi Fleiss

03:18.397 --> 03:20.466
out of business.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.967
- Who even is that?

03:22.680 --> 03:24.704
- One of the greatest

03:22.680 --> 03:24.704
American entrepreneurs ever.

03:24.737 --> 03:26.639
- Wasn't she a stripper

03:24.737 --> 03:26.639

03:26.673 --> 03:29.808

So I just helped Grayson

05:57.723 --> 05:59.591
kinda start

05:57.723 --> 05:59.591
getting the word out there

05:59.625 --> 06:02.279
and you know what, Chase?

05:59.625 --> 06:02.279
I mean, I knew I was good

06:02.279 --> 06:03.463
but, like, not this good.

06:03.495 --> 06:05.310
- Oh, my God, Savannah.

06:05.310 --> 06:07.800
You're also very humble.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.601
- I'm gonna take this

06:07.834 --> 06:09.601
to the post office for you.

06:09.636 --> 06:10.704
- Thanks.

06:10.737 --> 06:13.540
- You, going to

06:10.737 --> 06:13.540
the post office?

06:13.572 --> 06:14.908
- Savannah,

06:14.940 --> 06:17.543
I can remember when

06:14.940 --> 06:17.543
stamps were 10 cents each.

06:17.576 --> 06:19.579
- Who uses stamps anymore?

06:19.612 --> 06:21.470
- What are you talking about?

06:19.612 --> 06:21.470
How do you mail it?

06:21.470 --> 06:22.949
- This is like a paper

06:21.470 --> 06:22.949
that I guess you, like,

06:23.490 --> 06:25.218
prepay for online.

06:25.250 --> 06:26.252
[laughs]

06:26.286 --> 06:28.153
- Son, I'll take these,

06:28.187 --> 06:29.822
but you keep an eye on her.

06:29.855 --> 06:31.156
Love you.

06:29.855 --> 06:31.156
- Love you.

06:39.331 --> 06:41.670
<i>- Ready, Gray? Look straight.</i>

06:41.670 --> 06:42.836
You look cool, Grayson.

06:42.869 --> 06:45.471
Never thought I'd say that

06:42.869 --> 06:45.471
but you look kinda cool.

06:45.504 --> 06:46.740
- [kisses]

06:45.504 --> 06:46.740
- All right, wait.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.742
Oh, that's of me. Hold on.

06:48.774 --> 06:50.377
You know what, Gray,

06:48.774 --> 06:50.377
if there's one thing

06:50.409 --> 06:51.745
that I've learned from daddy,

06:51.778 --> 06:54.800
it's that you've gotta strike

06:51.778 --> 06:54.800
when the iron's hot.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.382
And right now, your iron's hot.

06:56.415 --> 06:57.951
- Please don't start

06:56.415 --> 06:57.951
acting like Dad

06:57.983 --> 06:59.319
or I'm gonna have to fire you.

06:59.351 --> 07:01.454
- All right, now,

06:59.351 --> 07:01.454
like, jump off

07:01.487 --> 07:03.189
and we can get

07:01.487 --> 07:03.189
some action shots, okay?

07:03.223 --> 07:04.891
- All right.

07:04.923 --> 07:07.127
- The models are here.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.694
- Yeah.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.694
- What's up?

07:08.728 --> 07:09.928
Ready? Pose, come on.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.970
- It took y'all long enough.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.365
- Savannah, what model

07:11.130 --> 07:12.365
do you know

07:12.399 --> 07:14.701
shows up on time?

07:12.399 --> 07:14.701
- Y'all are not models.

07:14.733 --> 07:15.802
- Where have y'all been?

07:15.834 --> 07:17.803
- We had to take

07:15.834 --> 07:17.803
Nanny some soup.

07:17.836 --> 07:19.720
- She wasn't feeling good,

07:17.836 --> 07:19.720
you know?

07:19.105 --> 07:20.673
Gotta keep the grandmother

07:19.105 --> 07:20.673
doing well.

07:20.706 --> 07:21.740
- Oh, my...

07:21.774 --> 07:22.809
- Gray, how much are the shoes

07:22.841 --> 07:23.877
that I've got on right now?

07:23.910 --> 07:24.877
They're comfortable.

07:24.911 --> 07:26.346
- Where'd y'all get those from?

07:26.379 --> 07:28.415
- We just got 'em.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.415
- Do you like these?

07:28.447 --> 07:30.582
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure

07:28.447 --> 07:30.582
I sold two pairs like that

07:30.617 --> 07:31.651
the other day.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.586
- Well, these were

07:31.685 --> 07:33.586
at Nanny's house.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.653
- What?

07:34.687 --> 07:36.560
- We saw all these

07:34.687 --> 07:36.560
boxes of shoes

07:36.560 --> 07:37.590
that were like halfway open

07:37.624 --> 07:38.792
and asked Nanny what they were.

07:38.824 --> 07:40.759
She said they were Dad's.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.961
- Well, did you see

07:40.793 --> 07:42.961
Grayson's name on the box?

07:43.629 --> 07:44.970
- I don't know, Savannah.

07:44.129 --> 07:45.331
As soon as I heard

07:44.129 --> 07:45.331
"Dad" and "shoes,"

07:45.365 --> 07:46.699
I blacked out and stole 'em.

07:46.733 --> 07:49.569
- Yeah, dropped off the soup,

07:46.733 --> 07:49.569
left with new kicks.

07:49.601 --> 07:50.836
- That doesn't even

07:49.601 --> 07:50.836
make any sense.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.305
- Maybe it's just

07:50.870 --> 07:52.305
a coincidence.

07:52.338 --> 07:53.505
- Yeah, I doubt that.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.807
Savannah,

07:53.540 --> 07:54.807
can you take me over there

07:54.841 --> 07:56.308
so we can see what's going on?

07:56.343 --> 07:57.911
- I mean, yeah, but--

07:57.944 --> 08:00.129
- Well, if y'all are going,

07:57.944 --> 08:00.129
we're definitely going too

08:00.129 --> 08:01.314
'cause I wanna see

08:00.129 --> 08:01.314
how this plays out.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.216
- Oh, of course you do.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.216
- I'm coming.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.685
I'd like to be a private dick;

- Well, I don't like

08:21.768 --> 08:23.403
hanging out here.

08:23.435 --> 08:24.603
- But you come

08:23.435 --> 08:24.603
four times a week.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.773
- Because you have

08:24.637 --> 08:26.773
lots of dry cleaning.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.542
please?

08:30.576 --> 08:31.911
- Thank you.

08:30.576 --> 08:31.911
- Be right back.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.613
- You did drop off

all those options

08:33.645 --> 08:36.115
that I put in there to be sent

08:33.645 --> 08:36.115
to the dry cleaner's, right?

08:36.149 --> 08:37.283
- I got it.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.650
- Good, 'cause

08:37.317 --> 08:38.650
I wanna figure out

08:38.684 --> 08:40.953
which one of these outfits

08:38.684 --> 08:40.953
I actually look

08:41.539 --> 08:43.288
not the best in.

08:41.539 --> 08:43.288
- What do you mean?

08:43.322 --> 08:45.759
- Because I agreed to do

08:43.322 --> 08:45.759
this damn bachelor auction

08:45.792 --> 08:47.326
for Mama at the senior center.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.428

08:47.360 --> 08:49.428
the prices down for you, Julie,

08:49.461 --> 08:51.530
because it's going to be

08:49.461 --> 08:51.530
a bidding frenzy.

08:51.563 --> 08:53.659
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

08:51.563 --> 08:53.659
- So you're going to have to

08:53.659 --> 08:54.466
outbid every one of them there.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.534
- What you mean "outbid"?

08:55.567 --> 08:57.269
Why am I even a part of this?

08:57.302 --> 09:01.640
- Julie, all you need to do

08:57.302 --> 09:01.640
is to show up and show out.

09:01.674 --> 09:04.277
Because these silver-haired

Why does everything have to be

09:06.679 --> 09:07.846
some kind of scheme with you?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.548
This is for charity.

09:09.581 --> 09:11.116
- The only scheme here

09:09.581 --> 09:11.116
is you helping me

09:11.150 --> 09:12.785
get out of an afternoon

09:11.150 --> 09:12.785
of housework.

09:12.818 --> 09:15.210

09:12.818 --> 09:15.210
put that on my to-do list

09:20.159 --> 09:21.695

You gotta come in there

09:27.466 --> 09:30.235

09:30.269 --> 09:31.705
Since you're on such a roll,

09:31.738 --> 09:33.673
I have another favor to ask.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.673
- Okay.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.575
- Here's your cleaning.

09:35.607 --> 09:36.643
the card on file, right?

09:36.676 --> 09:38.311
- We do, thank you.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.311
- All right.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.679
- So you need to go to Mama's

09:38.345 --> 09:40.679
and help her do that filing

09:40.713 --> 09:42.414

09:40.713 --> 09:42.414
- I got that.

09:42.448 --> 09:44.840

09:47.120 --> 09:49.221
- Okay, well, you can help

09:47.120 --> 09:49.221
with some of this?

09:49.254 --> 09:51.570
- No, I can't because

I've gotta go get waxed

11:05.649 --> 11:06.331
as fast as you wanted 'em to.

11:06.365 --> 11:08.967
- Doing it for me

11:06.365 --> 11:08.967
is not helping me.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.438
- I try to be a good father,

11:12.471 --> 11:15.240
so therefore I buy some

11:12.471 --> 11:15.240
of Grayson's inventory to,

11:15.274 --> 11:16.743
you know, grow his confidence.

11:16.775 --> 11:18.244
You know, make him feel good.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.846
You know,

11:18.278 --> 11:19.846
it's kind of motivational

11:19.879 --> 11:21.815
for him to see those sales

11:19.879 --> 11:21.815
going through.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.384
- Like I said, it's always

11:21.847 --> 11:24.384
gotta be a scheme with you.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.686
One day, you're trying

11:24.417 --> 11:26.686
to rig the senior center

11:26.720 --> 11:27.921
bachelor auction,

11:27.953 --> 11:30.523
now you're trying to run

11:27.953 --> 11:30.523
this tennis shoe line.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.919
- And if people

11:30.557 --> 11:32.919
would leave me alone,

11:32.919 --> 11:34.940
I would accomplish

11:32.919 --> 11:34.940
what I'm trying to do.

11:34.940 --> 11:35.861
- You need to make this right

11:34.940 --> 11:35.861
with Grayson

11:35.894 --> 11:37.730
without your credit card.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.832
- See, I resent that.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.869
- I know you had the best

11:39.865 --> 11:42.869
intentions for Grayson,

11:42.902 --> 11:45.105
but what you're doing

11:42.902 --> 11:45.105
is not working.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.373
- Let's just pause for a second

11:46.405 --> 11:48.173
because you didn't go

11:46.405 --> 11:48.173
buy all my candles.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.376
- I would have.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.376
- Yeah, but you didn't have to.

11:50.409 --> 11:53.712
Because I was not bailed out

11:50.409 --> 11:53.712
whenever I was 14, 15.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.582
I had to keep my nose down

11:53.746 --> 11:56.582
and work hard.

11:56.615 --> 11:58.283
Maybe you should

11:56.615 --> 11:58.283
stop being so soft.

11:58.317 --> 11:59.619
- Exactly.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.620
You need to let him

11:59.652 --> 12:01.620
learn on his own.

12:01.653 --> 12:03.222
- He's gotta put in

12:01.653 --> 12:03.222
that hard work

12:03.255 --> 12:04.823
in order to get

12:03.255 --> 12:04.823
where he wants to get.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.558
- Sometimes you gotta

12:04.857 --> 12:06.558
let somebody fail

12:06.592 --> 12:09.162
in order for them to grow.

12:06.592 --> 12:09.162
- Next thing you know,

12:09.195 --> 12:10.562
me and Savannah

12:09.195 --> 12:10.562
are writing a business book

12:10.596 --> 12:11.663
and a parenting book.

12:10.596 --> 12:11.663
- [snaps]

12:11.697 --> 12:13.899
- Bam.

12:11.697 --> 12:13.899
- [laughs]

12:15.634 --> 12:19.304
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

12:19.338 --> 12:21.408
- Okay, I need you

12:19.338 --> 12:21.408
to go file this.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.775
So that's for the cable.

12:22.808 --> 12:24.177
- Oh, my God.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.578
Who even has

12:24.210 --> 12:26.578
paper bills anymore?

12:26.613 --> 12:29.282
- Just put 'em in the filing

12:26.613 --> 12:29.282
cabinet and shut up.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.583
- [chuckles]

12:29.315 --> 12:31.583
- Look at this picture.

12:31.618 --> 12:34.120
This was Aunt Alice.

12:31.618 --> 12:34.120
- Mm-hmm.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.554
- She had a wooden leg.

12:35.587 --> 12:38.792
And she had the best

12:35.587 --> 12:38.792
knock-knock jokes.

12:38.825 --> 12:41.794
[laughter]

12:41.827 --> 12:44.230
She was precious.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.633
- Well, even though

12:44.264 --> 12:46.633
you're not feeling 100%,

12:46.665 --> 12:49.436
you still got your personality.

12:46.665 --> 12:49.436
- That's for sure.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.500
- Well, I appreciate you two

12:49.469 --> 12:52.500
coming over here

12:52.105 --> 12:53.405
and helping me today.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.542
Now, 'cause you know

12:53.440 --> 12:55.542
Todd is just useless.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.711
- Mm-hmm,

12:55.575 --> 12:57.711
it is a constant struggle.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.278
I mean, y'all wouldn't believe

12:59.312 --> 13:01.470
the stuff he has me doing

12:59.312 --> 13:01.470
some days.

13:01.470 --> 13:02.948
My day starts out with,

13:03.490 --> 13:04.250
"Oh, Julie,

13:03.490 --> 13:04.250
can you have me some

13:04.283 --> 13:05.884
"fresh juice squeezed, please?

13:05.918 --> 13:07.953
It's carrot apple ginger.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.953
Just a little bit of ginger."

13:08.539 --> 13:10.623
Then,

13:08.539 --> 13:10.623
"What am I gon' have for lunch?

13:10.657 --> 13:13.929
Well, you know,

13:10.657 --> 13:13.929
I don't really want that."

13:13.125 --> 13:14.827
- "I'm on a diet."

13:13.125 --> 13:14.827
- "I'm on a diet.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.730
"Oh, by the way, can you

13:14.860 --> 13:17.730
pick up my dry cleaning?

13:17.764 --> 13:20.659
"Oh, and did you see that

13:17.764 --> 13:20.659
spot on the floor out there?

13:20.659 --> 13:22.235
"And then what are you

13:20.659 --> 13:22.235
fixin' for dinner?

13:22.268 --> 13:24.971
'Cause it has to be homemade."

13:22.268 --> 13:24.971
I mean, it is nonstop.

13:25.710 --> 13:27.106
- Now listen, I know

13:25.710 --> 13:27.106
he ain't worth a nickel,

13:27.139 --> 13:29.308
but I gotta keep that to myself

13:29.341 --> 13:31.677
because I want people

13:29.341 --> 13:31.677
to bid on him

13:31.711 --> 13:34.547
at the bachelor's auction.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.547
- Oh, well, listen.

13:34.581 --> 13:38.118
He's told me that I've got to

13:34.581 --> 13:38.118
outbid everybody there

13:38.150 --> 13:40.919
'cause he doesn't want to get

13:38.150 --> 13:40.919
stuck with some old lady.

13:40.953 --> 13:44.323
- Well, listen, Todd's in

13:40.953 --> 13:44.323
for a rude awakening.

13:44.356 --> 13:47.860
Because the rules are you

13:44.356 --> 13:47.860
can't bid on family members.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.261
- What do you mean?

13:49.294 --> 13:50.764
- He's going home

13:49.294 --> 13:50.764
with somebody else.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.698
- [laughs]

13:52.731 --> 13:54.366
- Listen, I love this,

13:52.731 --> 13:54.366
and I'm gonna

13:54.400 --> 13:57.169
keep this little nugget

13:54.400 --> 13:57.169
of information to myself.

13:57.202 --> 14:00.399
We're gon' let him think that

13:57.202 --> 14:00.399
I'm gon' outbid everybody.

14:00.730 --> 14:02.341
And I cannot wait

14:00.730 --> 14:02.341
to see the look on his face

14:02.375 --> 14:05.412
when some little old woman

14:02.375 --> 14:05.412
in the corner grabs him.

14:05.445 --> 14:09.115
He is going to have a fit.

14:05.445 --> 14:09.115
It is going to be...

14:09.149 --> 14:11.840
my sweet revenge.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.840
- Sweet revenge.

14:11.116 --> 14:12.284
- Sweet revenge.

14:12.317 --> 14:14.653
- I'm disappointed

14:12.317 --> 14:14.653
that I'm gon' miss this.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.722
- Well, listen, it's more

14:14.687 --> 14:16.722
important that you rest

14:16.755 --> 14:18.191
and get to feeling better.

14:18.224 --> 14:20.759
- Sassy, I'ma give you $100

14:20.793 --> 14:24.230
and I want you to bid on me

14:20.793 --> 14:24.230
a nice piece of pie.

14:29.501 --> 14:31.971
<i>[bright music]</i>

14:32.871 --> 14:34.740
- Why are you picking me up

14:32.871 --> 14:34.740
and not Mama?

14:34.774 --> 14:36.275
- Because I wanted

14:34.774 --> 14:36.275
to pick you up

14:36.308 --> 14:38.211
so that we could go

14:36.308 --> 14:38.211
and have some fun today.

14:38.244 --> 14:41.347
And I wanted to apologize for

14:38.244 --> 14:41.347
interfering with your business.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.749
- What are we gonna do?

14:42.782 --> 14:44.317
- Um, whatever

14:42.782 --> 14:44.317
you wanna do, son.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.219
I mean, you wanna

14:44.350 --> 14:46.219
go have lunch?

14:46.251 --> 14:48.822
We can go have a facial.

14:46.251 --> 14:48.822
- No.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.123
- Hands and feet.

14:50.155 --> 14:51.457
- Daddy, stop.

14:51.490 --> 14:54.940
- Did you see your, um,

14:51.490 --> 14:54.940
what's in the back?

14:54.940 --> 14:56.796
- Oh, yeah, all my shoe boxes

14:54.940 --> 14:56.796
that you bought.

14:56.830 --> 14:58.865
Why don't you tell us

14:56.830 --> 14:58.865
why these are here?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.330
- Yeah.

15:00.330 --> 15:01.340
I'm pretty sure

15:00.330 --> 15:01.340
these are the shoes

15:01.340 --> 15:02.836
that Grayson sold last week.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.537
- I want you to know

15:02.869 --> 15:04.537
that I'm sorry

15:04.571 --> 15:08.409
for kind of butting in,

15:04.571 --> 15:08.409
but I was just trying to...

15:08.409 --> 15:09.442
give you a boost.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.510
- And I appreciate that

15:09.475 --> 15:11.510
but it's important to me

15:11.543 --> 15:13.645
to be successful

15:11.543 --> 15:13.645
and do it on my own.

15:13.679 --> 15:15.215
You gotta let me

15:13.679 --> 15:15.215
figure it out on my own.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.484
- Son, I'm proud of you

15:15.248 --> 15:17.484
for that.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.153
But I just don't want you to

15:17.517 --> 15:20.153
ever have to struggle.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.187
And I realize in order

15:20.186 --> 15:22.187
for you to grow,

15:22.221 --> 15:23.523
there's gotta be some struggle,

15:23.556 --> 15:26.590
but it's gonna be hard for me

15:23.556 --> 15:26.590
to stay in my lane

15:26.919 --> 15:29.328
when it comes to you

15:26.919 --> 15:29.328
because you're our baby.

15:29.361 --> 15:32.131
- Dad, have you ever actually

15:29.361 --> 15:32.131
stayed in your own lane?

15:32.164 --> 15:33.932
- Son, life is my lane.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.134
- Yeah, okay.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.710
- And I'm gonna ride it

15:35.168 --> 15:38.710
all night long.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.441
You know, Julie, after raising

15:39.505 --> 15:41.441
all these kids,

15:41.474 --> 15:42.808
you would think

15:41.474 --> 15:42.808
that it would get easier.

15:42.841 --> 15:45.311
But it gets harder every time.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.913
- And not to mention

15:45.345 --> 15:47.913
your tendency to over help

15:47.947 --> 15:50.182
gets worse every time.

15:50.216 --> 15:53.620
I mean, when they coined

15:50.216 --> 15:53.620
the phrase "bulldozer parent,"

15:53.653 --> 15:54.988
it was you they had in mind.

15:55.879 --> 15:56.990
- I don't think that

15:55.879 --> 15:56.990
I'm overbearing at all.

15:57.899 --> 15:58.725
I think that

15:57.899 --> 15:58.725
I'm one of the most selfless

15:58.758 --> 15:59.926
human beings out there.

15:58.758 --> 15:59.926
- Okay, most people that are

16:00.259 --> 16:03.289
overbearing don't think

16:00.259 --> 16:03.289
they are either.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.898
- So how are things going

16:03.629 --> 16:04.898
now that you're doing

16:04.931 --> 16:06.533
all the social media stuff?

16:06.566 --> 16:07.701
- They're going really good.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.690
I've had a couple

16:07.734 --> 16:09.690
of shoe fanatics

16:09.101 --> 16:10.870
try to tag my posts and stuff.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.407
- Well, I mean, you know,

16:12.339 --> 16:14.407
if you really wanted

16:14.441 --> 16:17.576
to make money and see the price

16:14.441 --> 16:17.576
of those shoes double,

16:17.610 --> 16:19.946
I could wear them

16:17.610 --> 16:19.946
for you one time

16:20.460 --> 16:23.783
and you could say,

16:20.460 --> 16:23.783
"Worn by Todd Chrisley."

16:48.774 --> 16:52.578
eligible bachelor in Nashville,

16:52.611 --> 16:54.799
Chase Chrisley!

16:54.799 --> 16:55.548
[both laughing]

16:55.581 --> 16:57.549
[cheers and applause]

16:55.581 --> 16:57.549
- Whoo, ladies! All right.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.200
He is 24, almost 25.

17:00.529 --> 17:03.230
He's got a new car

17:00.529 --> 17:03.230
to come pick you up in.

17:03.230 --> 17:06.259
And he loves "The Notebook"

17:03.230 --> 17:06.259
and candlelit baths.

17:06.589 --> 17:07.394
- Oh, yeah.

17:06.589 --> 17:07.394
- [laughing]

17:07.426 --> 17:11.640
- All right, Jeb Anderson

17:07.426 --> 17:11.640
is 58 and widowed.

17:11.970 --> 17:14.901
Up next, we've got John Smith.

17:11.970 --> 17:14.901
- Oh!

17:14.933 --> 17:16.803
- All right, Mr. Donald.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.405
Let's get the bids

17:16.836 --> 17:19.405
started at $15.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.807
- $15!

17:20.839 --> 17:22.842
- Ooh, all right.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.842
Let's say $40.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.576
- $40!

17:24.611 --> 17:26.246
- Ooh, number 11.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.246
All right, ladies.

17:26.278 --> 17:29.281
Can I hear $75?

17:26.278 --> 17:29.281
- Yeah.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.884
- $75, all right.

17:30.916 --> 17:33.920
Can I hear $200

17:30.916 --> 17:33.920
for Mr. Chase Chrisley?

17:33.952 --> 17:35.488
- [cheering]

17:33.952 --> 17:35.488
- 300 over here.

17:35.521 --> 17:38.324
Sold to 61! All right, ladies.

17:38.357 --> 17:39.792
[applause]

17:39.826 --> 17:42.162
Next we've got Todd Chrisley.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.162
[cheers and applause]

17:42.194 --> 17:45.731
All right, ladies,

17:42.194 --> 17:45.731
he is a father of five.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.567
He loves roller skating,

17:45.765 --> 17:48.567
long walks on the beach,

17:48.601 --> 17:50.436
and, well, talking on

17:48.601 --> 17:50.436
the phone very loudly.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.671
- Oh!

17:51.704 --> 17:54.708
- Let me get the bidding

17:51.704 --> 17:54.708
started at $5.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.769
- Look at you

17:54.740 --> 17:57.769
hamming it up on stage,

17:57.769 --> 18:00.460
fueling that bidding frenzy

17:57.769 --> 18:00.460
that you were so worried about.

18:00.799 --> 18:01.480
- Yeah, me and you.

18:00.799 --> 18:01.480
- All right, do I hear $5?

18:01.513 --> 18:03.490
- Well, it's all for charity.

18:03.829 --> 18:05.751
And besides, I'm just giving

18:03.829 --> 18:05.751
the crowd what they want.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.721
- Well, if they want you,

18:05.785 --> 18:07.721
they can have you.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.220
Come on, y'all.

18:09.549 --> 18:10.723
- $10 over here.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.250
$20?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.250
- Come on.

18:12.579 --> 18:13.492
- $20 in the back, all right.

18:13.526 --> 18:16.296
$25?

18:13.526 --> 18:16.296
- Come on, bid.

18:16.328 --> 18:18.298
- All right.

18:21.339 --> 18:22.469
- Julie,

18:21.339 --> 18:22.469
what are you playing at?

18:22.501 --> 18:24.700
This was not our agreement.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.806
- Well, there is a rule that

18:24.104 --> 18:26.806
you can't bid on family, so...

18:26.839 --> 18:28.807
- What?

18:26.839 --> 18:28.807
- [chuckles]

18:28.842 --> 18:31.877
- Can I hear $50

18:28.842 --> 18:31.877
for Mr. Todd over here?

18:31.911 --> 18:33.179
[cheering]

18:31.911 --> 18:33.179
- All right.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.814
- Y'all, he's great at chores.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.883
- Do I hear $100?

18:34.847 --> 18:36.883
- Yeah!

18:36.915 --> 18:38.518
- Over here. 150?

18:38.550 --> 18:39.853
Sold!

18:39.885 --> 18:42.388
Todd, you're going home

18:39.885 --> 18:42.388
with 75.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.857
- [laughs]

18:44.891 --> 18:46.393
- Julie, this is

18:44.891 --> 18:46.393
the ultimate betrayal

18:46.425 --> 18:48.609
and I'm not gonna forget it.

18:48.609 --> 18:51.640
- Something tells me

18:48.609 --> 18:51.640
you're gonna be just fine.

18:51.640 --> 18:52.432
- All right, ladies.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.500
We have Elliott Kennedy.

18:54.534 --> 18:57.700
All right, he is 26 years old,

18:57.700 --> 18:58.304
from Atlanta,

18:58.337 --> 19:00.673
and, well, he comes from

18:58.337 --> 19:00.673
a long line of Kennedys.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.107
[laughter]

19:02.142 --> 19:04.911
Can I get the bidding

19:02.142 --> 19:04.911
started at $25?

19:05.109 --> 19:06.179
- 25!

19:05.109 --> 19:06.179
- $50?

19:06.211 --> 19:08.140
- 50!

19:06.211 --> 19:08.140
- 150!

19:08.480 --> 19:09.348
- 150, all right.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.517
Can I see 200?

19:10.549 --> 19:12.251
- [screams]

19:10.549 --> 19:12.251
- Oh, my gosh!

19:12.285 --> 19:13.385
Yeah, he's all right.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.922
For that, can I see $500?

19:16.220 --> 19:18.910
- Nanny would have

19:16.220 --> 19:18.910
loved this!

19:18.124 --> 19:19.491
- 550 over here.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.560
All right, 600.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.163
650?

19:21.594 --> 19:24.163
- Uh, 700.

19:24.196 --> 19:25.164
- A thousand!

19:25.198 --> 19:28.434
- Oh, and sold, 76 sold!

19:28.468 --> 19:30.670
All right, ladies, oh, my God.

19:34.540 --> 19:37.344
- Todd, can you clean that pool

19:34.540 --> 19:37.344
with that phone in your hand?

19:37.376 --> 19:38.877
- Yes, ma'am.

19:37.376 --> 19:38.877
- Are you sure?

19:38.912 --> 19:40.512
- Yeah, I'm good.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.480
This is such bull[bleep].

19:42.480 --> 19:43.883
- There's some leaves

19:42.480 --> 19:43.883
over on this side.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.384
Just wanna make sure

19:43.916 --> 19:45.384
you grab 'em.

19:45.417 --> 19:47.529
- Get behind the stairs too,

19:45.417 --> 19:47.529
Todd.

19:47.529 --> 19:48.454
- Yeah, and then after that,

19:48.488 --> 19:51.825
there's a brush where you clean

19:48.488 --> 19:51.825
the sides of the pool.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.660
- Yes, ma'am.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.660
- 'Cause that needs to be done.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.295
- Yes, ma'am.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.295
- Also, Todd,

19:55.327 --> 19:57.497
make sure you clean out

19:55.327 --> 19:57.497
beside the filter.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.231
It's really dirty.

19:59.265 --> 20:00.666
- The--

19:59.265 --> 20:00.666
- Yeah.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.268
- So you want me to put

20:00.700 --> 20:02.268
my hands in it?

20:02.301 --> 20:03.936
- That's what I paid for, Todd.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.538
- [sighs]

20:03.970 --> 20:06.538
- [chuckling]

20:06.573 --> 20:08.407
- No, there's not really

20:06.573 --> 20:08.407
anything in here

20:08.441 --> 20:10.609
except some chlorine tablets.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.609
- No, it's dirty.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.178
I see stuff coming out of it.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.178
Clean it.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.146
You heard the fine young lady.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.146
- You need to shut up.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.582
- [chuckles]

20:15.615 --> 20:17.616
- Todd, you and Elliott,

20:15.615 --> 20:17.616
come on over here

20:17.650 --> 20:19.519
and pour us some lemonade.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.788
- I'm bummed that

20:19.551 --> 20:21.788
I missed the auction,

20:21.820 --> 20:23.256
but this is worth it all.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.458
- Miss Debra.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.458
- Thank you.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.460
- Ooh, that lemonade

20:25.491 --> 20:27.460
is calling our name.

20:27.493 --> 20:28.862
- There's nothing

20:27.493 --> 20:28.862
in that one, Mama.

20:28.894 --> 20:29.929
It's weak.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.564
- Well, I might not

20:29.962 --> 20:31.564
like it as good.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.432
- [chuckles]

20:31.597 --> 20:33.432
- Here you go, Elliott.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.835
- Oh, yes, ma'am. Thank you.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.137
- Oh, that feels so good.

20:38.171 --> 20:39.239
- Todd, me.

20:39.271 --> 20:40.507
You're supposed to be

20:39.271 --> 20:40.507
fanning me.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.608
- Okay.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.608
- [chuckles]

20:42.642 --> 20:44.243
And what'd you learn

20:42.642 --> 20:44.243
this week, Todd?

20:44.277 --> 20:46.413
- That you can't be trusted.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.413
- Try again.

20:46.445 --> 20:48.147
- I learned that sometimes

20:48.181 --> 20:50.316
I place too much

20:48.181 --> 20:50.316
pressure on you

20:50.349 --> 20:52.786
to do all the things that

20:50.349 --> 20:52.786
need to be done in our lives.

20:52.818 --> 20:54.653
And for that, I apologize.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.722
- See? Another valuable lesson.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.124
- Speaking of

20:56.756 --> 20:58.124
a valuable lesson,

20:58.157 --> 21:00.930
how the hell's Elliott

20:58.157 --> 21:00.930
go for $1,000

21:00.125 --> 21:01.661
and I go for 150?

21:01.694 --> 21:03.163
- Have you seen the way

21:01.694 --> 21:03.163
he cleaned that pool?

21:03.195 --> 21:06.432
It was worth every penny.

21:03.195 --> 21:06.432
- Oh, please.

21:06.465 --> 21:08.401
- Elliott, I need to

21:06.465 --> 21:08.401
go get my nails done.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.868
- Yes, ma'am.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.868
- You can drive me, right?

21:09.903 --> 21:11.403
- Oh, yeah, yes, ma'am.

21:09.903 --> 21:11.403
- I can do that with you

21:11.438 --> 21:12.939
'cause I need to have

21:11.438 --> 21:12.939
my feet done.

21:12.971 --> 21:14.606
- Uh, no, no, cutie.

21:12.971 --> 21:14.606
No, you stay here

21:14.641 --> 21:16.509
and get that

21:14.641 --> 21:16.509
pressure washing done.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.510
- All right, you, don't work up

21:16.542 --> 21:18.510
too much of a sweat.

21:18.545 --> 21:21.280
- 150, here you go, baby boy.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.849
- Fan me.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.353
- Yeah, bring that fan

21:23.883 --> 21:26.353
over here, pool boy.

21:26.385 --> 21:28.654
- [sighs]

21:26.385 --> 21:28.654
- I get hot too.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.624
- I'm sure you do.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.624
- [chuckles]
