WEBVTT

00:06.252 --> 00:09.252
ELEANOR: The only way to truly ensure
that the Urca gold doesn't return here

00:09.276 --> 00:12.477
is to eliminate everyone with the knowledge
of where it is and how to retrieve it.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.229
MAX:
Are you angry with Anne for leaving

00:14.315 --> 00:17.650
or are you angry with me for
offering her the opportunity?

00:17.735 --> 00:19.284
You think there's something valuable enough

00:19.370 --> 00:22.121
to make the British Navy forget
that you and I are pirates?

00:22.206 --> 00:23.956
Not what, who.

00:24.041 --> 00:26.909
Acquiring the partnership of a
plantation the size of Mr. Underhill's

00:26.994 --> 00:29.074
could help bolster commerce
on my side of the island.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.963
VANE:
Richard Guthrie betrayed Nassau.

00:31.048 --> 00:33.716
As far as you and I,
I was warned about you.

00:33.751 --> 00:35.718
Warned you would betray me.

00:35.753 --> 00:37.920
I made clear the price for the girl.

00:37.972 --> 00:40.756
You should know me well enough
to know I will claim it.

00:40.841 --> 00:44.226
My father said there would
be law in the Americas

00:44.261 --> 00:46.729
the day Captain Flint
swung over Charles Town.

00:46.764 --> 00:48.981
- You're Captain Flint?
- I am.

00:49.066 --> 00:51.150
And you wish an audience with Lord Ashe?

00:52.903 --> 00:53.936
Welcome to Charles Town.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:09.073 --> 03:10.989
I can't say enough, miss,

03:11.075 --> 03:14.743
how saddened we all are by this loss.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.495
All my life I was a pauper.

03:16.580 --> 03:19.414
With your father's help I plied a trade.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.917
I'll always be grateful for that.

03:28.092 --> 03:30.008
(Distant chatter)

03:34.515 --> 03:36.565
Do you need a respite, ma'am?

03:38.068 --> 03:39.818
(Sighs)

03:43.073 --> 03:45.941
(Chatter)

03:46.026 --> 03:47.943
(Sighs)

03:54.001 --> 03:57.619
Some bread and fruits from the girls.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.872
May I sit?

04:16.223 --> 04:17.723
Thank you.

04:19.276 --> 04:21.976
I can imagine how difficult this must be.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.698
Being the daughter they expect you to be.

04:26.784 --> 04:28.483
I would think that at least with me,

04:28.535 --> 04:30.152
you would know that I know the truth

04:30.237 --> 04:32.821
about how complicated
the situation is for you.

04:32.907 --> 04:35.874
Your relationship with him.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.577
Your relationship with Captain Vane.

04:38.662 --> 04:41.964
And because of that,
you would not pretend otherwise.

04:41.999 --> 04:44.967
And that that might bring
some small measure of comfort.

04:45.002 --> 04:47.970
There is no part of this
that is complicated.

04:48.005 --> 04:50.839
I crossed Charles, he retaliated.

04:50.925 --> 04:53.175
That is what happens in a war.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.977
A war?

04:55.012 --> 04:57.679
A state of affairs in
which resolution only comes

04:57.731 --> 04:59.431
when one side has suffered enough pain

04:59.516 --> 05:01.733
it's willing to concede its principles.

05:01.819 --> 05:04.736
I presume you've heard Charles's manifesto.

05:04.822 --> 05:07.072
I heard it's been read aloud on the beach.

05:08.692 --> 05:12.110
Everyone must take a side, he says...

05:12.196 --> 05:15.530
with him against
reconciliation with England

05:15.582 --> 05:17.950
or with me.

05:18.035 --> 05:20.585
Those people out there heard him

05:20.671 --> 05:24.289
and they came to my door
not to pay their respects,

05:24.375 --> 05:26.208
not because they loved my father...

05:28.212 --> 05:31.263
but because when this war begins,

05:31.348 --> 05:34.216
they want to make sure I don't
mistake them for enemies.

05:35.386 --> 05:37.552
Is that why you've come?

05:39.106 --> 05:41.606
Or have you yet to choose a side?

05:45.229 --> 05:47.980
MAN:
I'm interested to see what she does now.

05:48.065 --> 05:50.198
- (Chatter)
- (Goats bleating)

05:55.289 --> 05:57.239
How did that go?

05:58.993 --> 06:01.326
I have seen what Eleanor Guthrie can build

06:01.412 --> 06:03.295
when she is feeling ambitious.

06:03.380 --> 06:07.215
I have seen what she can
destroy when she is angered.

06:07.251 --> 06:08.917
Which of the two was she just now?

06:10.721 --> 06:13.138
She was something else entirely.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.309
How soon can you be ready to sail?

06:17.394 --> 06:19.394
Just finalizing the route,
sorting out supplies.

06:19.430 --> 06:22.230
I assumed we'd depart
tomorrow at some point.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.236
Leave as soon as possible.

06:28.272 --> 06:30.188
There are foul things brewing here.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.834
(Knocks on door)

06:42.920 --> 06:44.453
Yes?

06:44.538 --> 06:47.122
(Door opens)

06:53.464 --> 06:55.130
They're here.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.934
Do you know why you're here?

06:58.969 --> 07:00.552
Yes, ma'am.

07:02.139 --> 07:03.855
Good.

07:07.778 --> 07:11.063
Then we move at sundown.

07:13.283 --> 07:16.234
- (Bell tolling)
- (Chatter)

07:16.320 --> 07:20.072
The proposal that I have
come all this way to make

07:20.157 --> 07:23.742
is one that may at first
strike you as implausible.

07:23.827 --> 07:26.745
However, I ask that you remember that...

07:26.830 --> 07:30.165
(Clock ticking)

07:30.217 --> 07:32.384
I love my daughter.

07:33.637 --> 07:36.004
More than life itself.

07:36.090 --> 07:38.890
When I received that despicable letter

07:38.976 --> 07:41.476
I was given to dark thoughts, rage.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.480
A desire to visit revenge upon those men

07:45.516 --> 07:48.483
that put her through that ordeal.

07:48.519 --> 07:50.235
It would seem only reasonable, then,

07:50.320 --> 07:52.737
that I bear an equal measure of gratitude

07:52.823 --> 07:54.940
to the man who rescued her from it.

07:55.025 --> 07:58.860
Were it not for that gratitude,
you and I would not be speaking like this.

07:58.912 --> 08:03.865
You and Colonel Rhett would be
having a very different conversation.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.535
Because while I knew you once,

08:06.620 --> 08:08.620
called you friends once,

08:08.705 --> 08:11.706
I cannot fathom

08:11.758 --> 08:14.759
how those people I knew turned into you.

08:14.845 --> 08:17.262
Ask me, then.

08:17.347 --> 08:19.047
Anything you want to know.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.549
I will be truthful.

08:22.019 --> 08:23.602
Anything?

08:25.272 --> 08:27.722
When did you first arrive in Nassau?

08:27.808 --> 08:31.059
Two months after we saw you last in London.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.727
February, thereabouts.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.613
The first accounts of Captain Flint raiding

08:34.698 --> 08:36.648
shipping in the area began in June.

08:38.702 --> 08:40.869
You became the captain of a
pirate crew in four months?

08:40.904 --> 08:43.989
I became the captain of a
pirate crew faster than that.

08:44.073 --> 08:47.159
It took us four months to secure
our first significant prize.

08:47.244 --> 08:48.743
How did you manage that so quickly?

08:48.829 --> 08:50.078
I met a man in a tavern.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.797
Quartermaster of a well-respected crew.

08:52.883 --> 08:55.000
I persuaded him

08:55.085 --> 08:57.335
that I was someone worth listening to.

08:57.421 --> 08:59.421
A crew followed shortly thereafter.

08:59.473 --> 09:00.922
And how long after that was it

09:00.974 --> 09:04.509
that you decided to murder Alfred Hamilton?

09:07.514 --> 09:11.766
MIRANDA: I received a letter
from a former servant.

09:13.237 --> 09:14.903
She mentioned innocently

09:14.938 --> 09:17.906
that Alfred was travelling in secret.

09:17.941 --> 09:21.276
And she mentioned the name of the ship.

09:22.829 --> 09:25.697
I encouraged James to find him.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.116
And to kill him.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.787
If you're going to blame anyone for it,

09:32.873 --> 09:35.757
- please, blame me.
- (Gun cocks)

09:39.713 --> 09:41.630
The governor may know who you are.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.381
I only know what you are.

09:43.467 --> 09:45.684
Let us agree that if either one of you

09:45.769 --> 09:48.053
gets any closer to the
governor than you just did,

09:48.138 --> 09:50.722
I will be forced to consider
that a threat to his person

09:50.807 --> 09:53.141
and I will shoot you where you stand.

10:06.873 --> 10:08.957
I cannot stand before you

10:08.992 --> 10:11.960
and claim to be without sin.

10:11.995 --> 10:14.329
When we received that letter from you

10:14.414 --> 10:17.249
informing us of Thomas's death,

10:17.334 --> 10:19.501
the damage wrought by Alfred Hamilton

10:19.586 --> 10:21.469
was too much for us to bear.

10:24.341 --> 10:25.757
We were angry.

10:25.842 --> 10:30.061
We allowed that anger to
drive us to a dark deed.

10:31.598 --> 10:34.516
But I ask you not to
judge me by that one deed.

10:34.601 --> 10:39.187
Judge me by the ends that I
have come here in service of.

10:39.273 --> 10:41.406
The redemption of Nassau

10:41.491 --> 10:44.442
in accordance with the
principles that you and I

10:44.528 --> 10:46.695
and she and Thomas Hamilton

10:46.780 --> 10:49.914
committed ourselves to all those years ago.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.286
I ask nothing from you but your ear.

11:02.596 --> 11:04.212
I'm listening.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.803
- (Men shouting)
- (Birds calling)

11:16.226 --> 11:19.311
Footrope. Bitch of a spot.

11:19.396 --> 11:22.280
Fucking death trap if it isn't
fixed before we set sail.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.906
Let's try this again.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.743
You idiots are the fucking
riggers of this ship.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.494
So which of you would like to volunteer

11:36.580 --> 11:38.663
to repair our topsail yard footrope

11:38.749 --> 11:41.249
so that when Captain Flint returns,
he returns to a ship

11:41.335 --> 11:43.501
that can hoist its fucking
sails without fatalities?

11:43.587 --> 11:45.637
It's a bad omen.

11:46.723 --> 11:48.423
A man died on them ropes.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.892
Can't touch it till it's fixed.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.266
You're all good people.

12:11.415 --> 12:13.365
Tell me something.

12:13.450 --> 12:15.083
Is he going to find anything up there?

12:15.118 --> 12:16.701
What would he find?

12:16.787 --> 12:20.121
An indication that the rope
didn't just fray on its own.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.173
No. Absolutely not.

12:24.261 --> 12:26.044
It'd be almost impossible.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.800
What?

12:39.109 --> 12:42.026
(Birds calling)

12:49.119 --> 12:50.485
What is it?

12:50.537 --> 12:53.405
I thought I saw something in the water.

12:59.079 --> 13:02.831
Tell the watch on the main so
they can keep an eye on it.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.549
I'm sure it was nothing.

13:04.634 --> 13:06.551
Tell them anyway.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.394
(Bagpipes playing)

13:23.854 --> 13:27.522
LAMBRICK: The Lord is my shepherd.
I lack nothing.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.024
He makes me lie down in green pastures.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.577
Leaves me beside the quiet waters.

13:32.662 --> 13:34.362
Refreshes my soul.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.997
He guides me along the right path

13:36.032 --> 13:37.999
for His name's sake.

13:38.034 --> 13:40.201
Even though I walk through
the darkest valley,

13:40.287 --> 13:43.338
I will fear no evil, for You are with me.

13:43.373 --> 13:46.374
Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.

13:46.460 --> 13:49.711
You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.

13:49.796 --> 13:52.180
You anoint my head with oil.

13:52.215 --> 13:54.549
My cup overflows.

13:54.601 --> 13:58.136
Surely Your goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life

13:58.221 --> 14:01.189
and I will dwell in the
house of the Lord evermore.

14:01.224 --> 14:03.024
- Amen.
- ALL: Amen.

14:15.572 --> 14:17.489
Mr. Underhill.

14:20.076 --> 14:24.379
All his wealth, all his ambitions,

14:24.414 --> 14:27.966
yet here he rests.

14:29.886 --> 14:31.920
One might see a lesson in that.

14:34.925 --> 14:36.474
Before you return home,

14:36.560 --> 14:38.843
I had hoped that you and
I might share a word.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.814
Privately.

14:42.899 --> 14:45.683
What do you wish to speak about?

14:47.187 --> 14:49.020
Ambition, sir.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.656
Yours and mine.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.530
ASHE:
Total reconciliation?

14:58.615 --> 15:00.114
This is what you're suggesting?

15:00.200 --> 15:01.916
A return to colonial rule

15:01.952 --> 15:04.502
with an existing power structure in place.

15:06.256 --> 15:09.173
And I am to believe that
500 hardened pirate raiders

15:09.259 --> 15:11.459
will voluntarily step down,

15:11.545 --> 15:14.846
fall in line with this plan of
yours and volunteer their labor?

15:14.931 --> 15:17.632
Not all of them.
A lot of them. Most of them.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.767
Enough to resist those that won't.

15:19.803 --> 15:23.054
Enough to make it worth
giving them a chance.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.557
I made an appeal to my crew of 100 men.

15:25.642 --> 15:28.192
And better than 70 of
them are sitting right now

15:28.278 --> 15:31.362
just outside your harbor
in full support of it.

15:31.448 --> 15:34.482
It is exactly as Thomas proposed

15:34.534 --> 15:36.317
- all those years ago in London.
- Yes.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.986
But then we were talking
about less than half

15:38.038 --> 15:40.989
the number of criminals on the island.

15:41.041 --> 15:45.159
We were talking about a failing colony,
not a failed one.

15:45.211 --> 15:47.495
We also didn't have the
most respected captain

15:47.581 --> 15:50.748
on the island standing
in advocacy of our plan.

15:50.834 --> 15:52.133
Now we do.

15:52.168 --> 15:54.335
We didn't have the trade boss of the island

15:54.421 --> 15:56.504
actively working to reform operations then.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.172
Now we do.

15:58.224 --> 16:01.009
And we didn't have a man
who has established himself

16:01.061 --> 16:04.512
as the New World's most committed
pirate hunter endorsing it.

16:04.598 --> 16:07.682
(Ticking)

16:18.028 --> 16:20.995
The first thing that they
will ask for is a name.

16:23.617 --> 16:27.285
- FLINT: A name?
- ASHE: It is as true now as it was then.

16:28.538 --> 16:30.371
New Providence will only ever succeed

16:30.423 --> 16:32.624
insofar as its governor can make it so.

16:32.709 --> 16:34.842
(Clock chiming)

16:34.878 --> 16:37.929
Were I to make this case to
the men I know in Whitehall...

16:38.014 --> 16:39.764
(Voice fades)
the first question that they will ask

16:39.849 --> 16:42.717
is who will oversee all this?

16:42.769 --> 16:46.938
Who will be responsible
for its success or failure?

16:47.023 --> 16:48.940
You?

16:53.446 --> 16:58.032
There are things that I can do to
help protect the fledgling colony.

16:58.068 --> 17:02.070
I can help establish the militia.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.988
I can organize the navy.

17:04.074 --> 17:06.240
But beyond that,

17:06.291 --> 17:10.411
I don't think that there's a part
for Captain Flint in Nassau's future.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.246
Not with the blood on his hands.

17:15.417 --> 17:17.919
He will have to go away

17:17.971 --> 17:20.922
and leave James McGraw and Lady Hamilton

17:20.973 --> 17:24.175
to retire to the interior in peace.

17:26.596 --> 17:28.730
- (Knocks on door)
- ASHE: Yes?

17:28.765 --> 17:29.765
(Door opens)

17:31.484 --> 17:34.686
Father, Mrs. Tyler says it's time

17:34.771 --> 17:36.437
to turn the room over for dinner.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.439
Please ask Mrs. Tyler to arrange a room

17:38.525 --> 17:40.274
for our guests to retire to in the interim.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.537
- (Clock ticking)
- Something wrong?

17:55.592 --> 17:58.126
Nerves.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.128
I'm fine.

18:08.722 --> 18:11.606
- (Violin playing)
- (Men chatting)

18:32.829 --> 18:35.496
If we're so worried he's gonna
find something up there...

18:37.167 --> 18:39.167
what are we still doing here?

18:39.252 --> 18:42.220
SILVER:
Where exactly do you think we'd go?

18:42.305 --> 18:44.422
Charles Town is sleeping with one eye open

18:44.507 --> 18:47.175
and a knife under its pillow tonight.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.010
Any one of us sets foot on that sand

18:49.095 --> 18:51.062
absent an engraved
invitation from the governor

18:51.147 --> 18:53.564
is likely to greet the sunrise swinging.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.853
We arrived on this ship.

18:58.905 --> 19:03.191
Until and unless Captain Flint
is successful in his endeavor,

19:03.243 --> 19:05.526
this ship is the only
way we leave here alive.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.454
If he was suspicious,
he'd have come down by now.

19:17.540 --> 19:19.707
I'm going to find Randall.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.210
See who I can ridicule
for the crew's amusement.

19:24.347 --> 19:26.964
(Wood and metal creaking)

19:27.050 --> 19:29.600
(Whistling)

19:43.449 --> 19:45.449
(Silver sighs)

19:45.535 --> 19:47.401
Randall.

19:47.487 --> 19:50.571
Crew address is due at next bells.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.703
If you have anything new
for me by the way of gossip,

19:52.709 --> 19:55.076
now... would...

19:56.579 --> 19:58.462
be the...

20:01.718 --> 20:03.251
time.

20:10.927 --> 20:13.394
(Chatter)

20:27.360 --> 20:29.827
(Clattering)

20:35.368 --> 20:37.618
(Knife slicing)

20:37.670 --> 20:39.704
(Man groans)

20:54.304 --> 20:56.437
- (Groans)
- DeGroot!

20:56.472 --> 20:58.105
- (Men shouting)
- Danger!

20:59.309 --> 21:01.726
(Groans)

21:49.275 --> 21:52.193
(Grunting)

21:54.697 --> 21:56.330
(Shouting)

22:02.839 --> 22:04.505
(Groans)

22:23.476 --> 22:25.302
JENKS:
Secure!

22:26.562 --> 22:29.113
MAN: Tie 'em up.
Down in the well with 'em.

22:33.202 --> 22:36.620
- (Man shouting)
- MAN #2: Take them alive.

22:44.747 --> 22:47.581
He doesn't want to consider it.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.835
He spent so many years hardening
himself to these ideas.

22:52.922 --> 22:56.090
But I don't think he can
work out how to say no.

22:56.142 --> 22:59.427
If he says no, it means there's
a part of him that is no more.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.813
A part of him he doesn't want to let go of.

23:02.899 --> 23:04.515
Did you mean it?

23:07.437 --> 23:09.820
Earlier.

23:09.906 --> 23:12.940
You said Captain Flint
would have to disappear

23:12.992 --> 23:14.575
for this plan to work.

23:14.610 --> 23:17.111
Are you truly ready to let him go?

23:22.785 --> 23:25.202
Did I ever tell you where
that name came from?

23:26.873 --> 23:28.589
No.

23:31.294 --> 23:34.628
I told you of my grandfather who raised me.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.964
A fisherman in Padstow.

23:39.185 --> 23:42.386
Well, in his youth

23:42.472 --> 23:45.389
he was a deckhand on a privateer

23:45.475 --> 23:47.475
off the coast of Massachusetts.

23:47.527 --> 23:52.029
And one night he was
alone on the late watch

23:52.115 --> 23:53.898
at anchor in the Boston Harbor

23:53.983 --> 23:57.902
when he sees this man

23:57.987 --> 24:01.455
climbing out of the
water and onto his ship.

24:01.491 --> 24:03.240
A stranger.

24:04.827 --> 24:07.795
Now, my grandfather thought
about ringing the bell,

24:07.830 --> 24:10.881
but curiosity got the better of him.

24:13.002 --> 24:14.668
The stranger approaches my grandfather

24:14.754 --> 24:16.837
and asks him for a little rum.

24:16.889 --> 24:21.092
Man said that he'd fled
his fishing trawler.

24:21.177 --> 24:23.394
Accused of killing another man.

24:23.479 --> 24:26.013
And when asked his name,

24:26.099 --> 24:29.517
the man simply replied

24:29.602 --> 24:31.102
Mr. Flint.

24:34.657 --> 24:36.440
This stranger, he never said whether

24:36.526 --> 24:40.778
he was guilty of the killing
or why he chose that ship

24:40.863 --> 24:43.781
or where he was bound, he just...

24:45.334 --> 24:47.451
just sat there.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.455
Eventually, he asked my grandfather

24:51.541 --> 24:54.208
for a little more rum from below.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.293
My grandfather went off to fetch it,

24:56.379 --> 25:00.131
but when he returned...

25:01.884 --> 25:04.351
the man was gone.

25:04.387 --> 25:07.221
My grandfather was in Boston
for a month after that.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.023
Never heard a word about a killing

25:09.058 --> 25:12.526
or a fugitive at large.

25:14.697 --> 25:17.648
It was as if the sea had
conjured that man out of nothing

25:17.733 --> 25:21.235
and then taken him back

25:21.287 --> 25:23.871
for some unknowable purpose.

25:30.463 --> 25:32.413
When I first met Mr. Gates

25:32.465 --> 25:34.331
and he asked me my name...

25:37.420 --> 25:40.087
I feared the man I was about to create.

25:42.642 --> 25:45.509
I feared that someone
born of such dark things

25:45.595 --> 25:48.262
would consume me were I not careful.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.981
And I was determined only
to wear him for a while

25:51.067 --> 25:55.603
and then dispose of him when
his purpose was complete.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.022
And I thought of that story.

26:05.415 --> 26:08.299
Am I ready to let him go?

26:10.003 --> 26:11.503
(Sighs)

26:11.588 --> 26:13.087
Truth is...

26:14.975 --> 26:16.424
every day I've worn that name

26:16.510 --> 26:18.760
I've hated him a little more.

26:21.815 --> 26:24.933
I've been ready to return him
to the sea for a long time.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.605
James...

26:31.775 --> 26:33.775
(Knocks on door)

26:34.861 --> 26:36.327
They're ready for you downstairs.

26:46.590 --> 26:50.458
- (Metal creaking)
- (Breathing heavily)

26:50.544 --> 26:53.428
(Men shouting on deck)

27:23.743 --> 27:26.744
What the fuck do we do now?

27:26.830 --> 27:29.914
The moment this ship is clear of the area,
if not sooner,

27:30.000 --> 27:31.633
Captain Vane will put the crew
to the sword, yes?

27:31.668 --> 27:33.334
Most likely.

27:33.386 --> 27:37.505
Eventually,
they find us down here and do the same.

27:37.591 --> 27:40.725
So either we swim to the beach
and likely face the noose,

27:40.810 --> 27:43.344
or else do nothing,
in which case it's the sword.

28:17.047 --> 28:18.713
Come with me.

28:18.765 --> 28:20.214
Where are we going?

28:20.266 --> 28:23.217
To execute the third option.

28:23.269 --> 28:26.054
Persuade Captain Vane
to surrender the ship.

28:27.774 --> 28:29.307
- (Horse snorts)
- (Quiet chatter)

28:29.392 --> 28:32.560
UNDERHILL:
Governor Ashe? He's coming here?

28:32.612 --> 28:35.063
Plans are underway as we speak.

28:35.115 --> 28:38.066
When he arrives,
I propose that you and I greet him together

28:38.151 --> 28:41.235
and we explain to him our joint
venture to reclaim Nassau.

28:41.287 --> 28:45.239
My ships, your sugar.

28:45.325 --> 28:48.743
The return of legitimate
commerce and the return of law.

28:48.828 --> 28:51.996
For so many years

28:52.082 --> 28:54.549
I have watched you and your kind

28:54.584 --> 28:57.552
thieve and whore

28:57.587 --> 29:00.638
and kill like a plague upon this island,

29:00.724 --> 29:02.974
doing whatever you please because you can.

29:03.059 --> 29:05.843
I've heard your appeal.

29:08.765 --> 29:11.432
How could I be expected
to trust one of you?

29:11.484 --> 29:13.434
How could you trust a pirate?

29:14.487 --> 29:15.737
Exactly.

29:15.772 --> 29:18.439
I am no pirate, sir.

29:18.491 --> 29:20.241
I'm an Englishwoman.

29:20.276 --> 29:22.110
I'm my father's daughter.

29:22.195 --> 29:25.697
And I will be the end of piracy in
this place and it begins tonight.

29:26.783 --> 29:28.366
What do you mean?

29:28.451 --> 29:31.536
ELEANOR: I discovered a plan by
one of the crews on the beach

29:31.621 --> 29:35.206
to reclaim a prize that is so large
it would upset our world here.

29:35.291 --> 29:39.043
Embolden piracy for years,
possibly decades to come.

29:39.129 --> 29:41.262
I identified the members of that crew

29:41.297 --> 29:43.798
with the specific knowledge of
the whereabouts of that prize.

29:43.883 --> 29:47.468
And I have ended their
endeavor before it began.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.722
You've ended it? How?

29:55.395 --> 29:57.228
(Gurgling)

30:02.702 --> 30:04.652
(Muffled groaning)

30:07.373 --> 30:09.123
Shh.

30:09.159 --> 30:10.825
(Footsteps)

30:28.344 --> 30:30.261
You're back.

30:30.346 --> 30:32.230
Just landed.

30:44.277 --> 30:48.196
I shouldn't have left the way I did,

30:48.248 --> 30:49.997
without telling you.

30:51.701 --> 30:54.535
Wasn't your fault what happened.

30:54.621 --> 30:56.454
It was a hard fucking choice put on you.

30:56.539 --> 30:58.873
I didn't think I was gonna see you again.

31:01.377 --> 31:04.846
I thought you'd just get to Port Royal
and board a ship and never look back.

31:07.050 --> 31:08.633
I thought about it.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.941
But then I...

31:24.484 --> 31:25.650
What?

31:28.621 --> 31:29.987
Then I...

31:30.073 --> 31:31.405
(Gasps)

31:32.876 --> 31:33.876
(Shouts)

31:33.910 --> 31:35.576
(Anne shouts)

31:35.628 --> 31:37.211
(Groans)

31:38.248 --> 31:39.964
(Groans)

31:41.718 --> 31:43.384
(Grunting)

31:45.421 --> 31:47.922
(Groans)

31:48.007 --> 31:50.174
- (Screams)
- (Grunts)

31:54.931 --> 31:56.931
(Gasps)

31:57.016 --> 32:00.268
(Groans)

32:09.746 --> 32:11.662
(Ticking)

32:25.712 --> 32:28.296
My lord,

32:28.381 --> 32:30.715
I know there are many reasons
to say no to this, however...

32:30.800 --> 32:33.050
- Colonel Rhett.
- Yes, sir.

32:36.773 --> 32:38.856
I'd like everyone to clear the room.

32:38.942 --> 32:40.725
RHETT:
Sir?

32:42.362 --> 32:45.229
I'd like to speak with my
guests privately for a moment.

32:46.482 --> 32:48.282
Wait in the hall, please.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.887
I believe there is a
way that I can help you

33:09.973 --> 33:12.506
achieve your intentions
for the future of Nassau.

33:12.592 --> 33:15.426
And I am ready to do it.

33:17.563 --> 33:18.930
However,

33:19.015 --> 33:22.817
my plan will require an act of you,
Mr. McGraw,

33:22.852 --> 33:25.019
if it is to succeed.

33:28.608 --> 33:31.025
And I don't think you're going to like it.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.000
Are you hurt?

33:39.035 --> 33:40.701
Mostly unscathed, thanks to Anne.

33:48.211 --> 33:51.462
Mr. Stayton and Mr. Atz are dead.

33:52.849 --> 33:54.432
Jesus.

33:54.517 --> 33:57.184
MAX: It would be wise not
to tempt fate any further.

33:57.220 --> 34:00.137
Eleanor will be returning from
the interior sooner than later.

34:00.223 --> 34:02.523
Can you sail without those men?

34:06.362 --> 34:08.396
Yes.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.697
Fuck it.

34:10.733 --> 34:13.067
Fuck her.

34:13.152 --> 34:15.069
We leave now.

34:19.792 --> 34:22.376
Go get us our prize.

34:29.418 --> 34:31.552
- (Violin playing)
- (Chatter)

35:06.039 --> 35:08.289
MAN:
Shift capstan bars.

35:08.374 --> 35:10.374
Snap and go, boys.

35:10.460 --> 35:12.626
- MAN #2: Raise anchor.
- (Men grunting)

35:15.381 --> 35:18.933
Wait. You certain this is a good idea?

35:18.968 --> 35:22.103
Yes. We sever the forestay,
the ship can't sail till it's repaired

35:22.138 --> 35:23.898
- which could take hours, yes?
- Yeah, but...

35:23.973 --> 35:25.639
The longer Captain Vane
remains in this harbor,

35:25.725 --> 35:27.141
the more dangerous it is for him

35:27.226 --> 35:29.393
and the more likely it
is that Captain Flint

35:29.479 --> 35:30.978
might just win over the governor

35:31.030 --> 35:32.813
and bring his militia to
bear to retake the ship.

35:32.899 --> 35:36.033
I understand that, but the moment
you go out there to sever that line,

35:36.119 --> 35:38.536
they'll send a team of men down
here to clear the hold again.

35:38.621 --> 35:40.121
We evaded them once.

35:40.156 --> 35:42.873
Which makes trying it a second
time that much more insane.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.794
Perhaps.

35:58.841 --> 36:00.841
But I see no other way that I...

36:02.345 --> 36:05.012
we survive this ordeal.

36:05.098 --> 36:06.098
I can.

36:06.182 --> 36:08.566
We swim and hope for the best.

36:08.651 --> 36:12.103
It'd be dangerous,
but it wouldn't be suicide.

36:12.188 --> 36:13.604
Just tell me this,

36:13.689 --> 36:16.157
are you suggesting we do
this to save ourselves

36:16.192 --> 36:18.826
or are you suggesting we
do it to save the crew?

36:38.548 --> 36:40.464
(Ropes creaking)

36:53.896 --> 36:57.398
- (Metal creaking)
- (Footsteps)

36:57.450 --> 36:58.899
(Door opens)

37:10.913 --> 37:14.415
You're the boatswain.
Mr. Gates's boy, aren't you?

37:21.757 --> 37:24.592
I've got a confession to make.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.727
The Singleton affair,

37:26.762 --> 37:29.430
when Jack and I attempted to
alter the vote on your ship,

37:29.515 --> 37:31.849
see Flint deposed,

37:31.934 --> 37:36.437
it was intended to induce key
men on your crew to defect.

37:36.489 --> 37:39.773
Then to recruit them ourselves.

37:39.859 --> 37:42.693
But most specifically,

37:42.778 --> 37:45.079
it was with an eye toward recruiting you.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.781
We'd heard about you.

37:47.867 --> 37:49.814
Not some petty thief in it for coin.

37:49.899 --> 37:52.600
Not some coward

37:52.652 --> 37:55.853
in need of a bottle to find
his courage in a fight.

37:55.938 --> 37:58.272
A proper pirate

37:58.324 --> 38:00.358
committed to our way of things.

38:00.443 --> 38:02.243
Committed to a life free of the yoke...

38:02.278 --> 38:03.494
Fuck you.

38:05.281 --> 38:07.665
And loyal to a fault.

38:10.670 --> 38:13.371
You can see how that

38:13.456 --> 38:16.841
is a man we'd have wanted
on our side of things.

38:20.713 --> 38:23.130
A man I could still use now.

38:28.388 --> 38:31.138
You have no fucking idea
what's going on here,

38:31.190 --> 38:32.640
do you?

38:32.692 --> 38:35.276
Flint stole from me and
I'm making it right.

38:35.311 --> 38:37.862
Exactly. You hate Flint.

38:40.400 --> 38:41.649
I hate Flint.

38:43.653 --> 38:48.322
But right now he's talking about
how we survive what comes next.

38:48.374 --> 38:51.158
And you're talking about
what you think is yours.

38:51.244 --> 38:53.661
When the navy arrives,
they aren't gonna give a fuck

38:53.713 --> 38:55.796
what belongs to you or what belongs to me.

38:55.832 --> 38:59.800
Because to them,
there is no difference between you and me.

38:59.836 --> 39:02.586
He has you so afraid of an imagined threat.

39:02.672 --> 39:05.473
Nah. (Laughs)

39:05.508 --> 39:09.593
I saw it with my own eyes.

39:09.679 --> 39:12.012
The garrison on Harbour Island.

39:12.098 --> 39:14.682
Royal Marines, a full company of them.

39:14.767 --> 39:16.767
200 men in support.

39:16.853 --> 39:18.736
The Scarborough anchored.

39:18.821 --> 39:20.855
And a commander just waiting for the order

39:20.907 --> 39:22.690
to begin his assault against us

39:22.742 --> 39:24.525
and exterminate every last one us.

39:24.610 --> 39:27.411
There is nothing imagined about the threat

39:27.497 --> 39:29.864
we all face, I assure you.

39:29.949 --> 39:32.249
And right now your only
plan to reckon with it

39:32.335 --> 39:33.868
is to try and fight them head to head,

39:33.953 --> 39:36.704
each crew for themselves?

39:39.842 --> 39:43.094
Right now, Flint's plan is the only plan.

39:51.471 --> 39:53.387
(Sighs)

39:59.395 --> 40:01.228
(Grunting)

40:02.815 --> 40:05.733
(Rumbling)

40:09.906 --> 40:12.406
MAN:
Forestay!

40:12.492 --> 40:15.075
Forestay, Captain!

40:18.414 --> 40:20.831
(Chatter)

40:29.175 --> 40:31.759
- What's going on?
- We lost the forestay.

40:31.811 --> 40:33.761
Lost it? Fuck you mean, we lost it?

40:35.231 --> 40:38.349
Sabotage. We must have missed someone.

40:38.434 --> 40:39.767
Can we sail without it?

40:39.819 --> 40:42.436
Not without seriously
risking losing that mast.

40:42.488 --> 40:44.939
Drop the anchors. Repair the stay quickly.

40:44.991 --> 40:46.574
I'll get a team, clear the hold.

40:46.609 --> 40:48.108
No.

40:48.194 --> 40:49.860
I don't want to divert men
away from the prisoners.

40:49.946 --> 40:53.164
We can't leave a saboteur down there.

40:53.249 --> 40:54.748
I don't intend to.

40:58.538 --> 41:00.788
(Ticking)

41:06.262 --> 41:08.846
ASHE: There are men in Whitehall
who could potentially find

41:08.931 --> 41:11.966
a proposal such as yours to be plausible.

41:12.051 --> 41:16.020
On religious grounds, on economic grounds.

41:16.105 --> 41:18.055
I know some of these men.

41:18.140 --> 41:21.141
You could almost certainly
win them to your side.

41:21.227 --> 41:24.728
But there are other men who
will oppose it categorically

41:24.814 --> 41:28.816
for the same reason all men
refuse to do things they should.

41:28.868 --> 41:31.118
Pride.

41:33.072 --> 41:35.906
You think they're too proud
to put pardons on the table?

41:35.992 --> 41:37.491
I think they fear you.

41:37.543 --> 41:39.660
And to capitulate to something one fears

41:39.712 --> 41:43.330
is a humiliation that
powerful men cannot accept.

41:43.382 --> 41:46.667
If we are to persuade
them to ally with you,

41:46.719 --> 41:49.169
then we have to completely redefine

41:49.222 --> 41:51.472
their understanding of who you are,

41:51.507 --> 41:53.390
what you are.

41:54.844 --> 41:57.561
How do you propose we do that?

41:57.647 --> 41:59.730
With the truth.

41:59.815 --> 42:03.601
I will come with you to Nassau,
survey the situation.

42:03.686 --> 42:05.185
If it is as you say it is,

42:05.271 --> 42:09.156
you and I will sail to London together.

42:09.191 --> 42:11.442
And when we arrive,

42:11.527 --> 42:14.612
you will stand up

42:14.697 --> 42:16.363
and you will tell your story.

42:19.368 --> 42:21.285
My story?

42:23.706 --> 42:25.539
What part of my story?

42:25.625 --> 42:27.508
All of it.

42:31.881 --> 42:34.965
You will tell them about
the affair with Thomas.

42:37.553 --> 42:40.220
You will tell them how it ended.

42:40.273 --> 42:43.190
You will explain to them
what it drove you to do.

42:44.944 --> 42:46.560
You will reveal everything.

42:46.646 --> 42:49.063
And when you do,

42:49.148 --> 42:51.649
Captain Flint will be unmasked,

42:51.734 --> 42:53.484
the monster slain.

42:55.204 --> 42:59.540
And in his place will stand
before all the world a flawed man,

42:59.575 --> 43:01.909
a man that England can relate to

43:01.994 --> 43:04.912
and offer its forgiveness.

43:09.168 --> 43:11.085
(Sighs)

43:14.590 --> 43:17.224
(Clock ticking)

43:28.237 --> 43:30.938
What you're asking of me...

43:34.193 --> 43:35.693
I wish there were another way,

43:35.778 --> 43:38.612
but I have given it great
thought and I cannot find it.

43:43.452 --> 43:45.753
Tell me this is something
that you are willing to do,

43:45.788 --> 43:48.839
and you and I will walk
out of this house together,

43:48.924 --> 43:52.042
announce our partnership to the street,

43:52.128 --> 43:54.628
and prepare to set sail for Nassau.

44:15.701 --> 44:18.318
(Clock chiming)

44:30.583 --> 44:32.883
Your clock by the wall...

44:32.968 --> 44:35.002
where did you obtain it?

44:37.506 --> 44:38.839
What?

44:38.924 --> 44:41.091
It looks very much like
one that used to reside

44:41.177 --> 44:43.143
in my husband's parlor in London.

44:43.179 --> 44:45.179
Identical, in fact.

44:45.264 --> 44:47.147
I don't remember gifting it to you.

44:47.183 --> 44:48.649
It was there when I left.

44:48.684 --> 44:51.318
So I ask again,

44:51.353 --> 44:54.104
how is it you came to possess that clock?

44:57.076 --> 44:58.525
It was a gift.

44:58.577 --> 44:59.743
From whom?

45:07.920 --> 45:09.953
From Alfred Hamilton.

45:12.875 --> 45:15.542
The earl was no friend of yours,

45:15.628 --> 45:17.878
yet he grants you gifts from his own home.

45:17.963 --> 45:19.463
Why would he do that?

45:23.269 --> 45:25.636
All these years it never sat right with me

45:25.721 --> 45:29.189
how Alfred was able to turn
the navy against James.

45:29.225 --> 45:31.558
He was far too admired by his superiors

45:31.610 --> 45:35.562
for his career to be dashed
by solely on hearsay.

45:37.733 --> 45:40.451
Alfred would have known that.

45:40.536 --> 45:42.069
He wouldn't have gone to them

45:42.121 --> 45:45.739
armed only with unfounded suspicions.

45:45.791 --> 45:47.708
He would have needed a witness,

45:47.743 --> 45:51.662
someone who knew Thomas

45:51.747 --> 45:53.714
and James well enough

45:53.749 --> 45:56.083
to give the accusation credibility.

45:59.088 --> 46:01.555
Alfred came to you, didn't he?

46:01.590 --> 46:05.893
Asked you to betray Thomas
in exchange for which he'd...

46:05.928 --> 46:08.762
see you made a king in the New World.

46:17.439 --> 46:19.740
Perhaps this is an opportunity for us all

46:19.775 --> 46:21.441
to find a little forgiveness.

46:21.527 --> 46:23.327
Forgiveness?

46:25.114 --> 46:27.114
What forgiveness are you entitled to

46:27.199 --> 46:29.333
while you stand back in the shadows

46:29.418 --> 46:31.952
pushing James out in front of the world

46:32.004 --> 46:34.955
to be laid bear for the sake of the truth?

46:36.175 --> 46:38.375
Tell me, sir, when does the truth

46:38.460 --> 46:40.260
about your sins come to light?

46:40.296 --> 46:43.964
You know nothing of my sins.

46:44.049 --> 46:46.266
Were you there when
Alfred Hamilton threatened

46:46.302 --> 46:48.802
my family's standing, my daughter's future

46:48.888 --> 46:50.304
if I failed to cooperate?

46:50.389 --> 46:55.225
Were you there when I visited
Thomas at the hospital

46:55.311 --> 46:57.811
to confess my sins and heard him offer

46:57.863 --> 47:00.314
his full and true forgiveness?

47:00.399 --> 47:02.533
He knew I had no choice in the matter.

47:02.618 --> 47:05.485
- MIRANDA: No choice?
- A hard choice.

47:05.538 --> 47:07.704
Made under great duress,
but with the intent

47:07.790 --> 47:10.073
to achieve the least awful outcome.

47:10.159 --> 47:12.492
You wish to return to civilization.

47:12.545 --> 47:15.045
That is what civilization is.

47:20.920 --> 47:24.004
I am so very sorry for
what you have suffered

47:24.056 --> 47:26.173
and for any part I may have played in it.

47:26.225 --> 47:28.008
Please believe that.

47:28.060 --> 47:30.727
But at this point, the most important thing

47:30.813 --> 47:33.146
is what comes next, what we make of this.

47:33.182 --> 47:35.983
- You destroyed our lives!
- Miranda.

47:36.018 --> 47:38.235
- You caused our exile!
- I am sorry for what I did.

47:38.320 --> 47:41.521
- Thomas died in a cold, dark place...
- I am trying to help you.

47:41.607 --> 47:43.407
- What more do you want from me?
- What do I want?

47:43.492 --> 47:45.442
I want to see this whole goddamn city,

47:45.527 --> 47:49.863
this city that you purchased
with our misery, burn.

47:49.915 --> 47:52.833
I want to see you hanged
on the very gallows

47:52.868 --> 47:55.869
you've used to hang men for
crimes far slighter than this.

47:55.955 --> 47:58.205
I want to see that noose around your neck

47:58.257 --> 48:00.841
and I want to pull the fucking
lever with my own two hands!

48:00.876 --> 48:02.843
(Gunshot)

48:05.214 --> 48:06.797
(Gasps)

48:06.882 --> 48:08.131
This is not what I wanted.

48:08.217 --> 48:09.716
Do not shoot him.

48:09.802 --> 48:12.269
- (Shouting)
- ASHE: Don't shoot!

48:12.354 --> 48:13.971
(Grunting)

48:29.655 --> 48:32.139
- (Abigail screams)
- (Horse whinnies)

48:32.207 --> 48:34.124
(Snorting)

48:40.833 --> 48:42.582
We have a deal, then?

48:44.420 --> 48:45.752
Yes.

48:46.805 --> 48:48.422
(Sighs)

48:50.926 --> 48:52.926
We must get back before we're missed.

48:52.978 --> 48:54.594
We have much work to do.

48:55.931 --> 48:58.098
Your father...

48:58.150 --> 49:00.267
when he came to me seeking sanctuary,

49:00.319 --> 49:03.103
telling me he wished to resist the
continued presence of the pirates,

49:03.188 --> 49:07.357
he told me he'd repented for his past sins.

49:07.443 --> 49:09.076
He seemed so genuinely contrite.

49:11.196 --> 49:13.664
I knew his reputation.
I knew he was most likely

49:13.749 --> 49:16.783
telling me the story I wanted to hear,

49:16.869 --> 49:19.753
but his contrition was utilitarian at best.

49:19.788 --> 49:22.589
But you,

49:22.624 --> 49:25.509
you don't even seem to be
wanting to appear that way.

49:28.130 --> 49:30.797
The time for storytelling is past.

49:30.883 --> 49:33.216
Now is the time for cold, hard truths.

49:36.939 --> 49:39.856
- (Frogs croaking)
- (Crickets chirping)

49:42.811 --> 49:45.312
(Horse snorts, neighs)

49:47.616 --> 49:48.865
What is this?

49:48.951 --> 49:50.984
Who are you?

49:53.789 --> 49:55.205
Are you Underhill?

49:55.290 --> 49:58.658
- I am.
- Then I suggest you step aside, sir.

49:58.744 --> 50:00.327
We've no quarrel with you.

50:01.380 --> 50:04.715
However, we will be taking the girl.

50:11.173 --> 50:13.673
(Wind blowing)

50:27.906 --> 50:30.190
(Creaking)

50:56.802 --> 50:59.970
(Man whistles)
Launch approaching!

51:02.724 --> 51:05.892
(Bell ringing)

51:18.907 --> 51:20.740
Hello.

51:31.470 --> 51:32.752
Hello.

51:37.009 --> 51:39.176
Man your stations.

51:39.261 --> 51:41.094
Ready the guns.

51:43.348 --> 51:46.066
- What's happening?
- Shut the fuck up.

51:57.996 --> 52:00.280
So...

52:02.284 --> 52:04.951
what do you suppose happens next?

52:05.037 --> 52:07.838
MAN:
Pirate vessel!

52:07.923 --> 52:10.090
Pirate vessel!

52:10.125 --> 52:13.126
What follows is a message

52:13.178 --> 52:16.346
from the Lord Governor
of the Carolina Colony.

52:16.431 --> 52:18.548
"I trusted the good faith of your arrival

52:18.634 --> 52:21.134
and I accepted Captain Flint as my guest

52:21.220 --> 52:23.270
in the same spirit.

52:23.305 --> 52:25.605
But I now regret to inform you

52:25.641 --> 52:28.892
that he has violated that trust
in a most deceitful manner."

52:28.977 --> 52:32.812
- What?
- "Therefore I've placed him under arrest.

52:32.898 --> 52:36.149
This trial and its resulting sentence

52:36.235 --> 52:39.786
will be swift, just, and final.

52:39.821 --> 52:43.240
And it will reestablish
beyond any shadow of a doubt

52:43.325 --> 52:47.377
that the rule of law lives in Carolina,

52:47.462 --> 52:50.497
that the men and women of this place

52:50.549 --> 52:54.084
will not shrink from you, from any of you,

52:54.169 --> 52:56.670
from any like you,

52:56.755 --> 52:59.506
and that the death of
piracy in the New World

52:59.591 --> 53:03.426
has never been nearer than today.

53:03.512 --> 53:05.512
At the conclusion of this trial,

53:05.597 --> 53:10.066
if your ship remains,
I will seize or sink her."

53:15.941 --> 53:18.108
(Grunts)

53:19.861 --> 53:23.863
Now, let me tell you what happens next.

53:31.373 --> 53:34.207
(Men chattering)

54:01.570 --> 54:03.069
You were right.

54:08.243 --> 54:09.993
Right about what?

54:10.078 --> 54:13.330
They can't tell the
difference between you and I.

54:16.802 --> 54:20.971
Nassau is strongest when she's feared.

54:21.056 --> 54:23.139
And if what promises
to happen here tomorrow

54:23.225 --> 54:26.142
actually happens, a trophy

54:26.228 --> 54:30.263
made of one of her most notorious captains,

54:30.349 --> 54:32.816
she may never be feared again.

54:32.901 --> 54:36.736
So I suggest we do something about this.

54:36.772 --> 54:40.190
I suggest we...

54:40.275 --> 54:42.242
get him the hell out of there.

54:48.367 --> 54:50.583
(Footsteps)

54:50.619 --> 54:53.286
(Eleanor breathing heavily)

54:59.511 --> 55:01.344
HORNIGOLD:
Captain Hume.

55:03.632 --> 55:06.466
I understand you hold in
your possession 10 pardons

55:06.551 --> 55:11.187
for whomever was to deliver
you Captain James Flint.

55:11.273 --> 55:13.189
I wonder if I can't do better.

55:16.194 --> 55:18.361
(Muffled grunts)

55:24.119 --> 55:27.153
This is Eleanor Guthrie,
the trade boss of Nassau,

55:27.239 --> 55:30.957
the woman who lorded over
a savage pirate kingdom

55:30.992 --> 55:32.992
as if it were a plaything.

55:33.045 --> 55:36.463
And without whom it cannot function.

55:37.666 --> 55:39.749
Imagine, sir, how London would react

55:39.835 --> 55:42.335
to the arrival of the queen of thieves.

55:42.421 --> 55:44.804
Imagine the spectacle of her trial.

55:46.174 --> 55:47.974
Imagine the celebrity

55:48.009 --> 55:50.643
that'll be heaped upon her captor.

56:09.998 --> 56:12.499
(Muffled shouting)

56:34.222 --> 56:36.789
