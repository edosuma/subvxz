00:48.959 --> 00:51.336
In a fictional Canada,
a new government comes into power

00:51.461 --> 00:53.589
during the federal elections of 2015.

00:56.383 --> 01:00.596
Two months later, its cabinet
introduces the S-18 bill,

01:00.721 --> 01:04.558
aiming to amend
the Canadian health services policy.

01:06.810 --> 01:09.813
More specifically,
the highly controversial S-14 Bill

01:09.938 --> 01:13.108
stipulates that the parent of
a child with behaviour problems has,

01:13.233 --> 01:16.737
in a situation of financial distress,
physical and/or psychological danger,

01:16.862 --> 01:19.906
the moral and legal right
to put his children

01:20.032 --> 01:23.785
in the care of any public hospital,
without due process of law.

01:26.955 --> 01:29.249
This is the story
of Diane "Die" Després,

01:29.374 --> 01:37.374
a woman whose fate appears
to be intimately tied to this affair.

03:58.815 --> 03:59.775
You fuck!

04:04.154 --> 04:05.697
You cocksucker!

04:08.450 --> 04:09.284
Yeah?

04:18.668 --> 04:20.837
Love the pool.

04:20.962 --> 04:22.088
Sorry, Mrs. Després.

04:22.547 --> 04:24.424
We should've asked you
to bring your bikini.

04:24.966 --> 04:26.718
You a stand-up or something?

04:26.843 --> 04:28.637
You sign Steve's eviction form

04:28.762 --> 04:29.721
and you're both free.

04:30.388 --> 04:33.183
Free from what!
Are we gonna talk about this?

04:36.478 --> 04:38.230
Do you speak French?

04:38.355 --> 04:41.566
Just as good
as they do in France, yeah.

04:44.236 --> 04:47.864
At 12h1 5, your son
was in the cafeteria

04:47.989 --> 04:49.783
with four other residents,

04:50.408 --> 04:52.536
when a fire broke out.

04:53.328 --> 04:56.206
Little Kevin Julien was rushed
to the hospital,

04:56.331 --> 04:59.125
burned to the second,
if not third degree.

04:59.876 --> 05:02.712
Want me to draw you a picture too?

05:13.765 --> 05:15.517
Are those your kids?
They're cute.

05:17.477 --> 05:20.939
Your initials below mine,
and sign the second-to-last page.

05:51.261 --> 05:53.430
So what do we do now?

05:55.056 --> 05:56.641
There's no "we".

05:57.893 --> 06:00.145
You know what I mean.
Not you and me.

06:00.270 --> 06:01.855
Me and my son.
I'm not stupid.

06:02.856 --> 06:04.482
We gave Steve a chance.

06:04.900 --> 06:06.109
If you can't take him back,

06:06.443 --> 06:08.069
we'll send him
to our security department.

06:08.194 --> 06:09.112
Excuse me?

06:10.071 --> 06:12.991
Don't act surprised!
Come on!

06:13.116 --> 06:16.036
Your son has
a one-way ticket to jail.

06:16.828 --> 06:18.163
Are you insane?

06:18.288 --> 06:20.874
My boy ain't going to jail.
I know the drill.

06:20.999 --> 06:23.668
Once they're in,
they're done for.

06:23.793 --> 06:25.170
His educator says

06:25.295 --> 06:27.964
his positive attitude made progress.

06:28.548 --> 06:30.550
He keeps telling me
he's doing better.

06:31.176 --> 06:34.054
This is a detention centre.

06:36.848 --> 06:40.143
The kids do better...

06:40.644 --> 06:42.270
Until they don't.

06:43.897 --> 06:46.107
Have you given thought
to little Kevin Julien,

06:46.232 --> 06:48.234
scarred for life?

06:48.360 --> 06:50.153
Little Kevin, little Kevin...

06:50.278 --> 06:53.198
We gonna canonize the kid?
Shit him a statue?

06:53.323 --> 06:56.785
Tough luck! Next time, don't stick
your face in the microwave!

07:03.667 --> 07:06.086
- Jacqueline to Jacques.
- <i>I'm listening.</i>

07:06.753 --> 07:07.879
We're on our way.

07:09.839 --> 07:10.715
<i>Roger.</i>

07:17.263 --> 07:18.223
Listen...

07:18.682 --> 07:19.849
Diane...

07:21.893 --> 07:24.479
I've seen tons of kids
in and out of here.

07:26.106 --> 07:27.774
We save some,

07:27.899 --> 07:30.068
we lose some,
and that's the way of it.

07:30.694 --> 07:32.362
We tried helping Steve,

07:32.862 --> 07:34.239
as well as specialized schools,

07:34.364 --> 07:35.740
residential centres.

07:35.865 --> 07:37.534
Our centre tried helping him.

07:38.201 --> 07:39.452
Your turn.

07:41.079 --> 07:44.040
And what am I gonna do
with him all day long?

07:44.666 --> 07:46.459
I can't drag him to work.
I got a job.

07:46.584 --> 07:49.295
I can't dump everything
and go party with my kid.

07:49.421 --> 07:50.755
I'm broke.

07:51.631 --> 07:54.300
I'm this close to welfare
and welfare's a fucking no.

07:54.426 --> 07:55.176
When he turns 16,

07:55.802 --> 07:58.722
he'll be eligible
for youth detention.

07:58.847 --> 08:01.141
I ain't gonna send my son
to a jail for lil' punks

08:01.266 --> 08:05.020
waiting to be big punks!
They'll fuck him up.

08:08.606 --> 08:10.483
Did you...

08:10.900 --> 08:13.236
...consider the S-14 law?

08:17.032 --> 08:18.199
The new law.

08:19.617 --> 08:21.119
Forget about it.

08:21.244 --> 08:21.995
As a last resort.

08:22.370 --> 08:23.621
I'll never do that to my son!

08:32.589 --> 08:35.133
Don't consider him or yourself
invincible.

08:35.258 --> 08:38.178
That's the worst thing you could do.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.890
Loving people doesn't save them.

08:42.849 --> 08:44.642
Love has no say.

08:45.351 --> 08:46.644
Unfortunately.

08:49.939 --> 08:51.816
Skeptics...

08:52.358 --> 08:53.860
will be proven wrong.

08:56.780 --> 08:58.114
Good luck, Ma'am.

09:01.326 --> 09:04.913
<i>Jacqueline, it's Jacques.
We brought little Desprós</i>

09:05.038 --> 09:07.332
<i>to the isolation room
because he was out of control.</i>

09:07.749 --> 09:09.250
<i>Fucking son of a cunt!</i>

09:09.918 --> 09:12.045
<i>Don't ya touch me, bitch!
I dare ya, fucking homo!</i>

09:12.170 --> 09:16.800
- <i>I said calm down!</i>
- <i>Fucking suck-ass, ya flaming twat!</i>

09:17.342 --> 09:19.135
<i>Suck my dick, dipshit!</i>

09:19.260 --> 09:20.178
Roger.

09:22.222 --> 09:26.059
At least you fixed his bad language.

09:26.184 --> 09:27.519
You're stunning, babe!

09:27.644 --> 09:29.604
Every time, you're beautifuler!

09:29.729 --> 09:31.314
You look younger, too, that's dope!

09:31.439 --> 09:33.149
What's effin dope
is you starting a fire.

09:33.274 --> 09:35.026
That's real dope, boy!

09:35.151 --> 09:36.736
Fire's up my ass,
gotta let it out.

09:38.154 --> 09:41.324
Get your head out too,
once you're at it.

09:41.449 --> 09:42.617
Didn't ya miss me?

09:43.118 --> 09:45.203
I always think of ya, Mom!
You're always in my head!

09:45.328 --> 09:46.329
Your head's up your ass!

09:46.454 --> 09:48.498
Must be pretty dark in there.

09:48.623 --> 09:51.376
Dark as a black dude's ass
but I still see ya!

09:51.501 --> 09:52.919
Where the fuck's our ride!

09:53.044 --> 09:55.004
Ride's gone.
We'll take the bus.

09:56.381 --> 09:57.841
You're playing, right? LOL.

09:58.258 --> 10:00.760
LOL alright,
d'ya see the blood here?

10:00.885 --> 10:02.011
Who's the motherfucker?

10:02.887 --> 10:05.557
Some dumb-ass on Poirier Street.

10:05.682 --> 10:07.267
The car's an effin wreck.

10:07.392 --> 10:08.893
Can we sell the parts online?

10:09.018 --> 10:11.688
Fuck no.
Jeez, that foot hurts like a bitch!

10:11.813 --> 10:12.564
Gimme that.

10:13.690 --> 10:16.901
I couldn't stand
them fucking freaks anymore!

10:17.026 --> 10:18.153
Can I bum one?

10:19.070 --> 10:20.196
I smoke, here!

10:20.321 --> 10:21.823
Well, time to quit!

10:21.948 --> 10:23.575
I'm quitting too. On my birthday.

10:24.826 --> 10:27.412
You listen to me, Stevo!
Listen up!

10:27.912 --> 10:29.497
We gotta set some ground rules!

10:29.622 --> 10:31.416
You wanna live with Mom?
Stay outta trouble?

10:31.541 --> 10:33.168
You gotta help.

10:33.293 --> 10:35.253
That starts with mutual respect, bud.

10:35.378 --> 10:38.256
I don't wanna hear no more fuck yous,
am I clear?

10:40.258 --> 10:41.551
You deaf or what?

10:42.135 --> 10:44.721
- Where do we live now?
- St-Hubert, next to the 116.

10:44.846 --> 10:45.805
Sexy.

10:46.222 --> 10:47.432
I got my own room?

10:48.600 --> 10:51.060
I still got enough dough
for that, dimwit.

10:51.186 --> 10:52.770
I ain't gonna spoon at 40.

10:52.896 --> 10:54.314
- You're 46!
- Shut up!

10:54.439 --> 10:56.107
Don't look at the deco, eh!

10:56.232 --> 10:59.152
Tenant before, some old lady,
she died two months ago.

10:59.277 --> 11:01.237
There's so much tapestry in there

11:01.362 --> 11:02.363
we could start a shop.

11:02.697 --> 11:04.490
- I hate that ugly shit!
- I feel ya!

11:05.658 --> 11:07.160
You can get the last toke.

11:17.795 --> 11:19.547
You didn't even kiss me!

11:19.672 --> 11:20.840
First thing I did.

11:20.965 --> 11:21.925
I don't think so.

11:23.259 --> 11:24.510
You little shit.

11:24.886 --> 11:26.012
Come on, come on!

11:26.763 --> 11:29.057
You little shit!

11:29.182 --> 11:30.683
You're just like your father!

11:48.660 --> 11:50.620
Well, well!

11:51.287 --> 11:52.080
How is she?

11:52.455 --> 11:55.291
Same old! Hanging in there!

11:55.959 --> 11:57.085
Don't tell me that's your kid?

11:57.210 --> 11:58.544
You betcha!

11:58.670 --> 12:00.797
Just back from boarding school.

12:00.922 --> 12:02.548
- Paul.
- Steve.

12:03.758 --> 12:07.512
Great social skills, eh! So proud!

12:07.637 --> 12:10.181
Why don't you guys
come watch some TV?

12:10.306 --> 12:13.393
I'll fix some pine-nut pesto pasta
real quick!

12:13.518 --> 12:15.103
I dunno,

12:15.228 --> 12:16.145
some other time maybe,

12:16.896 --> 12:18.815
we're just gonna settle in
real smooth, ya know.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.525
Alright. Rain check, then?

12:24.445 --> 12:26.864
We gotta work
on that shit attitude, hon.

12:26.990 --> 12:28.533
"I'll fix some pasta..."

12:28.658 --> 12:30.493
Shut up!

12:30.618 --> 12:32.912
- Yo, who's that homo!
- A neighbour.

12:33.496 --> 12:36.582
Bitch, please!
He's obviousingly hitting on ya.

12:36.708 --> 12:40.211
"Obviousingly."
That ain't in the dictionary.

12:40.628 --> 12:41.421
We there?

12:44.132 --> 12:45.967
Not so five-stary, eh...

12:46.718 --> 12:48.052
Is that in the dictionary?

12:48.177 --> 12:49.595
This place's perfect, trust me.

12:49.721 --> 12:51.306
There's a big yard.
Big yard, big life.

12:51.431 --> 12:52.765
Two bathrooms, right?

12:52.890 --> 12:54.142
Sure!
Waterbeds and jacuzzis, too!

12:54.267 --> 12:55.310
Where's my room?

12:55.435 --> 12:56.853
Down there!

13:41.189 --> 13:43.816
Hey, Radio City Hall!

13:48.571 --> 13:51.657
Two radios at once!
Thanks but no thanks!

13:53.785 --> 13:54.744
What?

13:55.536 --> 13:58.247
Shut her trap, will ya!

13:59.082 --> 14:03.127
We got both of them playin,
it's a goddamn racket!

14:07.215 --> 14:10.176
Mom, I can't find my shit
in that mess.

14:10.301 --> 14:11.844
Where are dad's pics?

14:15.723 --> 14:17.266
Why d'you need that now?

14:19.477 --> 14:20.436
They're...

14:22.814 --> 14:26.234
They're in the bedroom!
I'm swimming in boxes, I dunno!

15:15.491 --> 15:16.701
No way...

15:18.870 --> 15:19.912
Crazy bitch...

15:27.670 --> 15:29.922
Fucking A!

16:07.251 --> 16:09.295
That's your last warning!

16:09.420 --> 16:13.007
That's another thing,
repeating myself again and again!

16:13.132 --> 16:14.425
That ain't in our contract!

16:15.051 --> 16:17.637
We gotta catch the 10h45 bus!
Otherwise we fall on AM shifts

16:17.762 --> 16:19.764
and we'll hit lunch traffic.

16:20.223 --> 16:21.182
Come on, get up.

16:21.307 --> 16:22.308
Fuck, man!

16:22.433 --> 16:23.643
Nice motel whiff, here...

16:24.060 --> 16:25.728
You're supposed
to knock <i>before,</i> fuck!

16:25.853 --> 16:27.855
You can be such a dumb-ass!

16:27.980 --> 16:28.856
Watch your mouth!
I knocked!

16:29.232 --> 16:31.943
Did not!
You just came in, fuck!

16:32.443 --> 16:35.071
24 hours you've been here
and this place is a slum!

16:35.196 --> 16:36.405
Tidy up!

16:36.531 --> 16:38.241
Can I jerk off in peace, before!

16:38.366 --> 16:39.867
Gimme your undies.

16:39.992 --> 16:42.245
The bunched-up tissues,
not so guest-friendly.

16:42.370 --> 16:44.288
So get your jizz together

16:44.413 --> 16:45.456
and we'll be in business.

16:45.581 --> 16:47.250
Gonna hold my dick when I piss too?

16:47.375 --> 16:55.375
If it helps you aim!

18:55.211 --> 18:56.170
Mommy?

19:12.895 --> 19:14.397
What's the matter, sweetie?

19:14.939 --> 19:16.649
"That we did win..."

19:16.774 --> 19:19.402
- Win what?
- The games?

19:19.985 --> 19:23.864
Plural form.
- So you put?

19:23.989 --> 19:26.409
An S.
- Very good.

19:39.505 --> 19:41.382
<i>$299.51, please.</i>

19:42.425 --> 19:43.509
Come again?

19:43.634 --> 19:44.927
It's $300.

19:51.100 --> 19:52.101
And what's this?

19:52.893 --> 19:54.145
A work of art?

19:54.520 --> 19:56.230
If it was 300 bucks
I wouldn't have rushed

19:56.355 --> 19:58.357
all the way here
to frolic in car jams!

19:58.482 --> 20:01.485
Ma, I gotta get those pens!
They're fucking dope!

20:01.610 --> 20:03.821
It's our Fall issue, come on, now!

20:03.946 --> 20:07.324
Oh really? So a schoolbook's price's
got a season now?

20:07.867 --> 20:09.410
Why of course, dear!

20:10.161 --> 20:12.246
"Why of course, dear, why of course!"

20:12.371 --> 20:14.165
How can I be so dumb!

20:14.290 --> 20:17.168
I bet it's written in pink
on every bitch's ass!

20:17.293 --> 20:20.671
Madam, our sales are valid
during the back to school period.

20:20.796 --> 20:22.339
Afterwards--
- I haven't got a choice...

20:22.465 --> 20:24.008
Smells like fucking strawberries!

20:24.133 --> 20:26.093
I'm writing shit
and it smells like strawberries!

20:26.218 --> 20:29.263
You don't need it, Stevie!
Stop moving things around!

20:29.388 --> 20:30.347
Try this one.

20:30.931 --> 20:33.309
Mom, wait up!
There's all this shit, too!

20:33.434 --> 20:34.477
I don't think so.

20:34.602 --> 20:35.561
But I need it!

20:36.353 --> 20:38.105
I'm home-schooling you,
not opening a stickers shop!

20:38.230 --> 20:38.898
Mom!

20:39.440 --> 20:41.108
Come on!
I'll be late for work.

20:41.233 --> 20:42.318
Bitch...

20:42.943 --> 20:45.446
You shouldn't talk to your mother
that way, young man.

20:46.697 --> 20:49.825
D'ya dip your bangs
in some ginger's ass or something?

20:50.201 --> 20:51.827
I don't buy cars online!

20:51.952 --> 20:54.538
I ain't gonna spend my life
at a mechanic's!

20:54.663 --> 20:57.458
You just gotta check your shit,
lowball the shit out of it!

20:57.583 --> 20:59.043
Look I know the market.

20:59.168 --> 21:01.128
You watch your suspensions, you--

21:01.253 --> 21:03.631
The market! Sure!
And I'm Marilyn Monroe!

21:03.756 --> 21:06.342
Well beats being the metro's bitch

21:06.467 --> 21:08.469
and spending mad cash on cab rides!

21:08.594 --> 21:11.847
Steve, lemme manage the budget
and focus on your beat-off schedule.

21:11.972 --> 21:14.683
Yo, respect me, girl!
Treat me like an adult!

21:14.809 --> 21:17.102
Mutual respect! Remember?

21:17.228 --> 21:20.606
Yo sir, can you cut the bongos,
it fucking sucks ass!

21:20.731 --> 21:23.359
Let the driver listen to his bongos!
We're almost there.

21:23.484 --> 21:24.527
Where the fuck are we!

21:24.652 --> 21:25.903
Sir, I said don't take that street,

21:26.028 --> 21:27.863
we'll get caught up in construction!

21:27.988 --> 21:29.698
You never said that.
You say that earlier!

21:29.824 --> 21:33.869
You kidding, right?
I said, "Don't take Ste-Hélène."

21:33.994 --> 21:35.079
That's as clear as it gets!

21:35.204 --> 21:36.914
And you still did, like a boss!

21:37.039 --> 21:38.707
Watch your mouth, boy!

21:38.833 --> 21:40.292
Sir, make a U-turn.

21:40.417 --> 21:41.502
I can't, my friend.

21:42.086 --> 21:44.088
- We're not your friends!
- Will you shut up, Steve!

21:44.213 --> 21:45.422
Sir, it ain't my problem.

21:45.548 --> 21:46.715
I told you DON'T go there.

21:46.841 --> 21:48.509
It's like all you want is to boost--

21:48.634 --> 21:51.095
What! You accuse me?
Telling me I'm trying to rip you off?

21:51.220 --> 21:51.887
Chill out!

21:52.304 --> 21:53.305
Look, you tell me I rip you off,

21:53.430 --> 21:55.558
you tell me I'm a crook,
with your son!

21:55.683 --> 21:57.226
You yell at me!
- Fuck off, Mamadou!

21:57.351 --> 21:58.143
Steve!

21:58.477 --> 22:00.229
What! Get outta my car! Now! Out!

22:00.354 --> 22:02.690
You idiots!
- Why don't ya shut your mouth!

22:02.815 --> 22:04.233
Imbeciles!

22:04.358 --> 22:06.360
Piece of shit!
Damn savages!

22:07.236 --> 22:10.114
That's quite a start, Stevo!
You gonna be my good luck charm.

22:10.239 --> 22:11.156
I could call the cops!

22:11.282 --> 22:13.367
I'mma call them too, dawg!

22:13.492 --> 22:14.743
I'll smash your face, little fucker!

22:14.869 --> 22:16.579
Teach your son some manners!
Bitch!

22:17.580 --> 22:19.832
- What'd you call my mom?
- Back off!

22:22.042 --> 22:24.753
What d'you just call my mom,
you big monkey!

22:25.170 --> 22:27.172
I ain't got time for pigs today!

22:27.298 --> 22:29.592
Motherfucking nigger!

22:30.301 --> 22:32.011
- Stop it!
- You shut your mouth, bitch!

22:32.136 --> 22:34.096
Fucking ratface!
Get out and fight me!

22:34.221 --> 22:36.807
Ratface! Nigger!
I think he got your point!

22:36.932 --> 22:39.059
Go back to your jungle
mixing coconut drinks!

22:39.184 --> 22:40.686
Not in my country!

22:40.811 --> 22:42.271
Stop being so racist!

22:42.396 --> 22:44.690
I'm not being racist!
He's a nigger!

22:44.815 --> 22:46.025
Sit your ass down.

22:46.150 --> 22:47.526
Hi, Diane. Unfortunately--

22:57.411 --> 22:59.038
Excuse me, Gilles, I'm so sorry.

22:59.163 --> 23:00.664
Forty minutes...

23:02.333 --> 23:04.043
Yes, Diane.
I'm so happy to see you.

23:04.460 --> 23:06.420
Mr. Gravel's on sick leave.

23:07.004 --> 23:09.548
I know, it's disappointing.
But by all means, sit down.

23:09.673 --> 23:11.967
What favour did you want
to ask my husband?

23:12.092 --> 23:15.179
I'm all ears
and I cannot wait to help you.

23:40.037 --> 23:40.996
Yo, girl!

23:41.872 --> 23:44.083
D'you want me to show ya
some sweet chill-out technique?

23:46.794 --> 23:49.380
I'd like to hear Gilles' opinion.

23:50.381 --> 23:52.216
I'm afraid I don't, doll.

23:53.258 --> 23:54.802
Don't call me doll.

23:55.427 --> 23:58.764
Gilles' gone, he can't
run the place and I'm in charge now.

23:58.889 --> 24:01.684
Sure he'd have been very moved
by your charms,

24:01.809 --> 24:03.060
but the decision's mine.

24:06.772 --> 24:08.148
You can't do this.

24:08.273 --> 24:10.192
The hell, I can.
You're not permanent.

24:10.317 --> 24:12.653
You'll be compensated.
100% legal.

24:13.904 --> 24:15.406
So no more Dear Abby?

24:15.739 --> 24:18.492
Yeah, only a real journalist
will write it.

24:22.871 --> 24:25.040
I'm talented; Gilles said so.

24:25.165 --> 24:26.333
He said I had great timing.

24:27.626 --> 24:31.171
I'm sure he loved the timing
of your tits in his face!

24:31.296 --> 24:35.092
But for me, your talent here
is to make photocopies

24:35.217 --> 24:36.927
and serve coffee four days a week.

24:37.052 --> 24:39.888
So if you got your son full time
and can't show up anymore,

24:40.014 --> 24:42.307
pack your shit
and sayonara, bitch!

24:44.852 --> 24:47.438
What are you doing in my bag?
Drop it.

24:47.855 --> 24:49.064
That's my stuff...

24:52.026 --> 24:55.863
It ain't our first ride,
Diane, is it?

24:57.197 --> 24:58.157
Look at me.

24:58.657 --> 25:01.660
We gonna be a team.
The two of us!

25:03.037 --> 25:04.371
I'm gonna control myself

25:04.496 --> 25:06.040
and I'll take care of you...

25:06.165 --> 25:07.207
I'mma protect you.

25:07.666 --> 25:10.335
Number one priority, school, ok?

25:10.461 --> 25:12.337
I was your age when I dropped out.

25:12.463 --> 25:14.548
And look at me now,
I'm a wreck!

25:14.673 --> 25:17.217
No diploma, no education, nada!
A fucking loser!

25:24.183 --> 25:25.225
What would Dad say?

25:25.726 --> 25:26.810
What he'd say?

25:26.935 --> 25:28.854
- I dunno.
- You know it.

25:28.979 --> 25:29.855
You know it, come on!

25:31.648 --> 25:33.400
Grab the future by the balls...

25:36.528 --> 25:38.489
- Fuck the past, in the ass.
- What?

25:39.073 --> 25:40.115
Fuck the past, in the ass.

25:42.785 --> 25:44.870
Yeah! It's fucking brilliant, eh!

25:45.245 --> 25:46.622
Alright, what's the damage...

25:46.997 --> 25:47.915
You're fine.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.374
I dunno 'bout fine!

25:49.708 --> 25:52.294
- You look great, promise.
- I look like a panda.

25:52.711 --> 25:55.130
Got shit running down my face.
Fucking hell!

26:00.844 --> 26:02.596
I always did that back at the Centre.

26:02.721 --> 26:06.517
Whenever I'd spazz
I'd hop in a bitching cold shower!

26:09.144 --> 26:11.438
Ma, you listening to me?

26:16.193 --> 26:18.237
What the hell...

26:52.354 --> 26:57.943
Your translator bailed last minute.
So I ended up translating...

26:59.486 --> 27:01.113
that kids' book, it was real cute...

27:01.238 --> 27:03.615
for a small collection...
Do you remember?

27:04.616 --> 27:08.537
That's it!
Exactly, yes, that's right.

27:11.081 --> 27:14.042
Yeah, so I've been thinking,
what if...

27:14.543 --> 27:16.003
A girl's gotta ask, right...

27:16.461 --> 27:17.838
if you had another...

27:19.131 --> 27:21.967
little contract like that for me.

27:22.384 --> 27:24.887
I mean, Marthe,
I know I don't have the résumé

27:25.012 --> 27:27.764
or the skills to translate some...

27:28.432 --> 27:30.184
2-foot thick Ken Follett!

27:31.727 --> 27:33.979
I know! Ken Follett!

27:34.396 --> 27:37.191
Yeah, as if! So huge!
It's too much for me.

27:37.316 --> 27:40.569
But you know, some kids thingy...

27:40.694 --> 27:44.364
I'm thinking, "Grab the Oxford
and Bob's your uncle."

27:44.907 --> 27:46.116
It's not...

27:51.580 --> 27:54.124
Just as a hobby... time killer...

27:54.958 --> 27:56.460
to kill some time.

28:09.306 --> 28:11.141
Of course I understand, Marthe.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.811
No! It's no big deal, of course!

28:16.647 --> 28:18.857
Things have been great.

28:18.982 --> 28:22.819
Steve's just moved back in.
We're starting...

28:23.570 --> 28:31.570
One chapter ends, another begins,
as they say.

30:55.389 --> 30:57.265
I'm back, baby!

31:00.477 --> 31:01.978
Where you been?

31:02.104 --> 31:03.730
I'm waiting like a fool
to home-school ya!

31:03.855 --> 31:05.232
Save it for tomorrow!

31:05.357 --> 31:06.858
I'm still catching up.

31:06.983 --> 31:08.318
'The hell's that crown?

31:08.443 --> 31:09.444
It's my new cap!

31:12.322 --> 31:13.990
And what's all this?

31:18.537 --> 31:19.871
Damn it...

31:22.791 --> 31:25.794
What's that cart, for God's sake!

31:25.919 --> 31:26.837
It's a cart!

31:27.546 --> 31:29.506
No shit, but why the fuck is it
in my driveway

31:29.631 --> 31:32.759
and why are you loading
my fridge with that stuff!

31:32.884 --> 31:36.054
Look at all the shitzels I got ya!
I'mma pimp this crib.

31:36.179 --> 31:37.097
Don't change the subject!

31:37.222 --> 31:38.265
It's goddamn food!

31:38.807 --> 31:40.642
I ain't gonna shove it under my bed!
But wait up!

31:45.355 --> 31:47.732
Told ya I'd take care of ya.

31:50.861 --> 31:55.407
You stupid motherfucking
dumb-ass idiot!

31:55.532 --> 31:57.909
How much did it cost?
- It ain't your business.

31:58.034 --> 31:59.453
The fuck it is

31:59.578 --> 32:01.580
when the pigs show up
'cause my son's a thief!

32:02.372 --> 32:03.707
I didn't steal it,
it's a gift.

32:03.832 --> 32:04.749
That's real sweet

32:05.375 --> 32:07.586
but that doesn't mean
you didn't steal it.

32:07.711 --> 32:08.795
Where d'ya steal that stuff?

32:09.296 --> 32:10.380
I didn't steal it!

32:11.131 --> 32:15.093
You tell me where you stole it all
and we're gonna bring it--

32:15.218 --> 32:18.638
I didn't steal it!
Are you fucking deaf, hoe?

32:18.763 --> 32:20.015
I didn't steal it!

32:20.140 --> 32:22.142
I ain't gonna repeat it,
stupid bitch!

32:23.351 --> 32:25.187
Calm down, don't throw a fit.

32:25.312 --> 32:27.939
Mommy isn't mad,
but we'll bring everything back--

32:28.064 --> 32:30.066
It's yours!

32:30.192 --> 32:32.277
We're not bringing back anything!

32:32.402 --> 32:35.614
It's yours!
Don't touch any fucking thing!

32:35.739 --> 32:38.867
Touch it, and I beat
the shit outta ya, you cunt!

32:40.118 --> 32:42.913
Steve, calm down, honey.
Calm down, honey.

32:43.038 --> 32:46.791
Don't you fucking "honey" me
to make up for things!

32:47.584 --> 32:50.212
Stop taking me for a fucking idiot!

32:50.337 --> 32:51.505
I got you a gift!

32:54.549 --> 32:57.761
Steve... it's a beautiful gift.

32:58.178 --> 33:00.764
Mommy likes your gift,
Mommy's happy.

33:00.889 --> 33:02.057
But now...

33:03.391 --> 33:06.353
you gonna calm down,
breathe nicely...

33:07.103 --> 33:09.856
...and you're gonna take your pill--
- Give me that...

33:09.981 --> 33:10.899
Stop!

33:11.525 --> 33:13.485
You gimme that shit
and I'mma fucking end ya!

33:13.610 --> 33:15.070
I'mma kill you all

33:15.195 --> 33:17.906
with your fucking meds!

33:18.031 --> 33:19.991
I'mma flush them meds
down the fucking drain!

33:20.116 --> 33:21.701
Got it?

33:21.826 --> 33:23.370
The meds and your head, girl--

33:23.495 --> 33:25.080
Stop!

33:29.543 --> 33:31.711
Mommy didn't wanna hurt you, baby.

33:31.836 --> 33:33.630
Mommy didn't mean wrong, okay?

33:33.755 --> 33:34.839
But Mommy...

33:35.507 --> 33:36.925
was choking.

33:37.050 --> 33:38.718
You were choking me, Steve.

33:40.470 --> 33:42.430
Show me your head,

33:42.556 --> 33:45.350
I'mma fix it and we gonna
calm down together.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.562
You attack me, you fucking snake?

33:49.688 --> 33:53.567
Mommy didn't do it on purpose!
Mommy was scared, OK?

33:54.609 --> 33:57.404
You wanna low blow,
you fucking whore?

33:57.904 --> 33:59.781
You wanna fight me?
Fine, me too.

33:59.906 --> 34:01.950
- Stop...
- 50-50!

34:02.075 --> 34:03.660
Wait till I get you!

34:03.785 --> 34:04.995
Stop, stop!

34:05.120 --> 34:06.496
Fight me you fucking wimp!

34:06.621 --> 34:07.706
Stop, Steve! Stop!

34:14.462 --> 34:16.715
You fucking cut me, bitch!

34:16.840 --> 34:18.925
I'm fucking bleeding!

34:23.722 --> 34:25.140
You gotta calm down,

34:25.265 --> 34:27.517
otherwise Mommy can't help.

34:27.642 --> 34:30.061
You're dangerous, you gotta chill,
you're in a state...

34:30.520 --> 34:32.355
Take your pill, okay?

34:33.273 --> 34:34.774
I'm fucking dizzy!

34:35.775 --> 34:39.112
Stop it, Steve, I swear...

34:39.946 --> 34:41.573
You can't do this to me!

34:41.990 --> 34:45.076
Mommy doesn't know what
to think anymore! I'm freaking out!

34:45.744 --> 34:50.040
You gotta be calm if I come out!
I don't wanna fight anymore!

34:53.376 --> 34:55.170
Answer me, I'm talking to you!

34:55.295 --> 34:56.630
I'm going fucking nuts!

34:59.174 --> 35:00.216
Answer me!

35:13.021 --> 35:14.105
Steve, you there?

35:14.230 --> 35:15.023
Fuck off!

35:32.415 --> 35:33.458
Are you alright?

35:37.337 --> 35:38.880
Feel dizzy?

35:52.644 --> 35:54.020
We should...

35:55.563 --> 35:57.941
We should really
get him to a hospital.

35:58.358 --> 36:00.068
No way, no hospital...

36:29.264 --> 36:32.809
Her ass smells like fucking roses.
It's written in the stars.

36:51.995 --> 36:52.954
Don't hurt him.

36:53.288 --> 36:54.914
- Don't try!
- Don't start!

37:00.545 --> 37:02.130
'The hell's that doobie?

37:02.255 --> 37:04.507
They give you that in hospitals
to kill the pain.

37:04.632 --> 37:08.344
Should we make your will?
Gimme that! Give it!

37:15.101 --> 37:15.935
You...

37:17.395 --> 37:18.521
I like you.

37:19.439 --> 37:20.815
But you're hurting me.

37:21.608 --> 37:23.401
But I love it when it hurts.

37:24.611 --> 37:27.197
Chill out, you're still my fave,
child-beater.

37:27.322 --> 37:28.448
Motherfuck!

37:28.573 --> 37:30.867
Take it easy, I'm just playing!

37:42.420 --> 37:43.755
What's your name?

37:55.850 --> 37:56.893
Kyla.

37:57.644 --> 37:59.229
Two syllables, better off that way.

37:59.354 --> 38:00.271
I'm kidding.

38:00.814 --> 38:01.773
Want some coffee?

38:03.066 --> 38:04.317
Juice? No?

38:05.527 --> 38:07.278
I got one of those kits too,

38:07.403 --> 38:09.781
somewhere in the boxes.
Didn't find it...

38:10.323 --> 38:13.117
I could've put some stitches
or whatever, but...

38:14.369 --> 38:15.829
Stupid kit.

38:16.329 --> 38:18.456
"If your child has trouble
with a subject,

38:18.581 --> 38:21.084
how can you take him
a step further?"

38:21.793 --> 38:23.211
As further away, please.

38:24.462 --> 38:27.590
A column matrix is a matrix
consisting of a single column...

39:28.610 --> 39:29.485
Hello.

39:29.611 --> 39:30.653
Hello!

39:31.362 --> 39:33.323
Nice to meet you, Diane Després,
from across the street.

39:33.448 --> 39:36.075
- OK. Hello...
- Hello!

39:36.910 --> 39:38.328
Is Kyla there?

39:38.453 --> 39:40.204
No... Yes...

39:40.330 --> 39:43.833
She's asleep.
You have a message for her?

39:43.958 --> 39:45.877
A message in a bottle, yep!

39:47.837 --> 39:50.089
She dropped by this afternoon...

39:50.757 --> 39:53.009
She was real nice.

39:53.134 --> 39:54.302
And I appreciate it.

39:55.511 --> 39:57.430
I wanted to give her this.

39:57.764 --> 39:59.182
What did she do?

40:01.309 --> 40:02.268
Nothing...

40:02.644 --> 40:05.229
Nothing... I mean... Anyway...

40:08.399 --> 40:12.403
I've heard it's a good one...

40:15.114 --> 40:15.907
Bye.

40:18.868 --> 40:22.664
If you got nothing tonight,
would you join us for a scoff?

40:27.126 --> 40:29.629
This is fucking boring!

40:31.714 --> 40:34.676
No more green veggies, 'ight,
you know I hate it.

40:34.801 --> 40:37.053
You father wasn't tall,
your mom ain't any better...

40:37.178 --> 40:39.889
If you wanna go past 5'7",
veggies are your friends.

40:41.224 --> 40:42.058
How are the onions?

40:42.809 --> 40:44.185
Brown. Ish.
I'm throwing in the veggies.

40:44.310 --> 40:45.478
That's right.

40:46.312 --> 40:48.481
<i>...at the General Hospital,
in an allegedly critical state.</i>

40:48.606 --> 40:50.149
<i>"A bloodcurdling death toll",</i>

40:50.483 --> 40:53.236
<i>says Maude Lajoie
from Montreal Police.</i>

40:55.989 --> 40:58.533
Don't smoke there,
it'll taste like ashes!

40:58.908 --> 41:01.869
It'll suck the odour in,
just like bread!

41:02.286 --> 41:04.414
Gimme that, you dork!

41:04.831 --> 41:06.082
<i>Indeed, the campus is,</i>

41:06.708 --> 41:08.459
<i>to say the least,
bathed in fear and distress.</i>

41:08.876 --> 41:09.627
Is it Kyla?

41:10.878 --> 41:13.464
<i>...troubled testimonies from
students who knew young Asselin.</i>

41:14.549 --> 41:15.842
Where's your man!

41:16.217 --> 41:17.343
The little neighbour was fun,

41:17.468 --> 41:18.970
I just wanted to play with her.

41:19.095 --> 41:22.140
- We were still in Laval, then--
- It's my story!

41:22.265 --> 41:25.184
Hun, you gotta give context,
put some meat around the bone!

41:25.309 --> 41:26.686
We're in fucking Laval, jeez!

41:26.811 --> 41:28.771
People speak English in Laval, 'ight?

41:32.358 --> 41:34.068
They speak English in Laval?

41:34.193 --> 41:35.486
More than you'd think.

41:35.611 --> 41:38.656
But I don't know a goddamn--

41:38.781 --> 41:40.992
Quit swearing! Goddamn, goddamn...

41:41.492 --> 41:44.370
Not a fucking word of English.
But when Mom and Dad

41:44.495 --> 41:46.414
didn't want me to get
what they were saying,

41:46.539 --> 41:47.582
they'd speak English.

41:48.082 --> 41:51.377
It'd always end with,
"Shut up! Fuck off!"

41:51.502 --> 41:53.504
So I'd tell Barbara
across the street,

41:53.629 --> 41:56.549
"Hey Barbara, come play with me!"

42:00.845 --> 42:02.764
No wonder he played alone.

42:03.514 --> 42:05.058
Great effin social skills!

42:06.059 --> 42:07.602
He always liked to mingle.

42:09.145 --> 42:10.772
D'you see that!

42:10.897 --> 42:12.273
You pig!

42:13.900 --> 42:15.318
Mingle!

42:26.037 --> 42:27.497
Do you like it, Kyla?

42:27.622 --> 42:29.457
Is mingle in the dictionary?

42:29.832 --> 42:31.125
Move on.

42:31.834 --> 42:33.211
Yes, thank you.

42:33.336 --> 42:34.295
Besides...

42:35.922 --> 42:39.926
Besides fixing my leg,

42:40.051 --> 42:41.511
what do you do in life?

42:45.973 --> 42:47.600
I'm on sabbatical.

42:48.017 --> 42:48.851
What the hell?

42:49.310 --> 42:51.020
Means time off. A break.

42:51.145 --> 42:52.271
A break.

42:52.396 --> 42:53.773
From what?

43:02.532 --> 43:04.492
What do you do, your job?

43:07.745 --> 43:08.746
Teacher.

43:09.122 --> 43:11.207
Yikes. Elementary, high school?

43:12.250 --> 43:13.084
High school.

43:14.669 --> 43:17.797
Kids your age.
From grade 7 to grade 9.

43:18.756 --> 43:20.049
You're getting better!

43:20.174 --> 43:22.218
Making long sentences.

43:22.343 --> 43:23.344
Idiot!

43:23.469 --> 43:24.470
What?

43:30.017 --> 43:31.144
Tough one, eh?

43:31.477 --> 43:34.730
I was always a bit shy, but...

43:38.734 --> 43:41.529
I've had my language problem
for two years.

43:43.281 --> 43:45.324
Seven-year cycle apparently,

43:45.449 --> 43:47.243
it comes and goes...

43:47.618 --> 43:49.912
It'll stop.

43:50.705 --> 43:52.665
I hope it doesn't, it's sexy.

43:53.499 --> 43:55.001
What? It is!

43:56.127 --> 43:57.712
What about you, Steve?

43:58.629 --> 44:00.298
I noticed the skateboard.

44:00.882 --> 44:02.425
It's not a skate, it's a longboard.

44:03.259 --> 44:04.760
You know the diff... No?

44:04.886 --> 44:07.013
The difference is that
the longboard--

44:07.138 --> 44:08.181
It's longer.

44:08.764 --> 44:10.641
Stay outta my story, jeez!
I'm a big boy, okay?

44:10.766 --> 44:12.018
I was talking to her.

44:12.894 --> 44:15.188
You're less mobile.

44:15.313 --> 44:17.815
- But--
- Stop! I'm explaining!

44:18.733 --> 44:20.818
I'm due for seconds! You?

44:22.236 --> 44:23.696
Another shot?
- Last one...

44:31.829 --> 44:32.914
Cheers.

44:34.081 --> 44:35.249
Cheer.

44:36.292 --> 44:40.630
So you... moved in the 450,

44:40.755 --> 44:42.965
you're on sabbatical...
What about your boyfriend?

44:46.469 --> 44:48.471
Computer programming.

44:49.472 --> 44:51.265
Big nerd, eh?

44:54.644 --> 44:56.646
Why did you leave Quebec City?

44:59.023 --> 45:00.608
Can I have one?

45:01.817 --> 45:02.860
You smoke?

45:02.985 --> 45:04.362
No, but...

45:06.239 --> 45:07.615
We're celebrating!

45:08.491 --> 45:10.284
Damn straight. Here.

45:10.409 --> 45:12.870
No holding back tonight.

45:12.995 --> 45:14.330
Be my effin' guest.

45:19.043 --> 45:23.130
It's my first night out
since we moved here.

45:26.425 --> 45:30.763
We're on transit
between Quebec and...

45:31.889 --> 45:33.474
God knows where.

45:35.476 --> 45:38.229
It depends on Patrick's job.

45:39.939 --> 45:41.357
What about your job?

45:47.738 --> 45:49.198
I'm...

45:50.241 --> 45:53.202
I'm not ready to work
with kids again, yet.

45:58.791 --> 46:02.628
We're trying something new, too.

46:07.216 --> 46:08.592
Steve has...

46:10.303 --> 46:11.387
ADHD.

46:11.721 --> 46:13.597
Disruptive, provoking...

46:14.557 --> 46:19.895
And apparently some...

46:21.105 --> 46:22.648
attachment disorder,

46:22.773 --> 46:24.692
or whatever it's called.

46:25.985 --> 46:28.779
He was okay when he was little.
We thought it was just...

46:31.782 --> 46:34.035
Hyperactivity.

46:35.995 --> 46:37.913
But his dad died
three years ago...

46:38.039 --> 46:40.541
D'you mind,
it reeks of smoke in here.

46:44.503 --> 46:46.047
The odor...

46:47.131 --> 46:49.383
Smells stale.

46:56.057 --> 46:57.475
By the way, Steve...

47:00.311 --> 47:02.355
About this afternoon...

47:04.106 --> 47:06.108
Steve's violent, eh?

47:07.360 --> 47:10.529
He's a sweet boy deep down,
loads of charisma...

47:11.614 --> 47:14.075
When he blows a fuse,
you best scram

47:14.784 --> 47:16.077
'cause it gets ugly.

47:18.204 --> 47:19.747
But I...

47:21.957 --> 47:24.043
...I don't touch my boy.

47:27.171 --> 47:28.381
I know that.

47:29.673 --> 47:32.218
They quickly jump to conclusions
at the hospital.

47:33.594 --> 47:35.471
I know the drill.

47:35.930 --> 47:37.807
Youth Protection, cops...

47:38.682 --> 47:42.728
They'd force him back
to George-Étienne Lemieux...

47:43.938 --> 47:46.357
But it ain't his place.
Right?

47:48.401 --> 47:50.403
You don't know him,
but you saw him.

47:52.738 --> 47:56.992
But I'm happy 'cause
it was tough being away from him.

47:59.120 --> 48:00.955
He's all mine now.

48:02.164 --> 48:03.457
And he's quite a number.

48:04.083 --> 48:06.001
You never get bored with Steve.

48:08.671 --> 48:12.007
Not a dull moment with Steve.

48:18.514 --> 48:20.266
There you have it.

48:20.391 --> 48:22.143
Fasten your seatbelt.

48:26.772 --> 48:27.982
Gawd help us all...

48:46.959 --> 48:48.002
You queen!

48:58.387 --> 49:00.931
That's from a mixtape his father
made a few years ago.

49:01.056 --> 49:02.308
All the songs

49:02.433 --> 49:04.185
from our road trip to Cali.

49:04.310 --> 49:06.854
We did the coast,
all the way down to L.A.

49:07.313 --> 49:08.772
He's got them on repeat.

49:09.899 --> 49:13.152
Effin' hell.
Alright, cake time.

49:16.864 --> 49:18.532
You smell like fucking heaven!

49:18.657 --> 49:20.868
<i>Eau Sauvage!</i> Christian Dior.

49:20.993 --> 49:23.037
My uncle gave me his leftovers.

49:23.162 --> 49:27.041
And I still wear it. Love the smell.
You know it, <i>Eau Sauvage?</i>

49:27.583 --> 49:29.210
Don't touch that, asshole!

49:39.220 --> 49:40.763
Whatcha doin'?

49:40.888 --> 49:44.433
Drop that shit for a sec,
come dance with your son!

49:45.601 --> 49:46.852
D'ya know the lyrics?

49:48.020 --> 49:49.021
It's rather...

49:49.146 --> 49:50.231
...rather famous.

49:50.773 --> 49:53.651
Come on, sing!
She's our effin' national treasure!

50:11.961 --> 50:14.922
There's our Kyla!
Lettin' her gospel out!

50:16.006 --> 50:24.006
You good, hun!

51:51.101 --> 51:53.437
Jesus H Christ...

51:54.772 --> 51:55.856
Oh boy!

52:34.103 --> 52:36.313
Hey, Kyla! This a bad moment?

52:36.438 --> 52:37.731
I just wanted to--

52:37.856 --> 52:38.816
I--

52:46.407 --> 52:50.119
I just wanted to tell you that...
yesterday was fun.

52:50.244 --> 52:52.705
Yeah, yeah, it was.
What a blast.

52:53.247 --> 52:54.164
Listen...

52:55.165 --> 52:57.960
D'ya think you could do me...

52:58.085 --> 52:59.837
a teeny-weeny favour?

54:04.568 --> 54:06.487
So, Die,

54:06.612 --> 54:09.948
I called Marty
right after you rang yesterday.

54:10.073 --> 54:12.993
Our junior section translator's
on leave with a couple gigs.

54:13.118 --> 54:14.870
One more, one less, he doesn't care!

54:15.579 --> 54:17.289
So timing-wise...

54:18.248 --> 54:19.458
You're dead on.

54:19.917 --> 54:21.919
Marthe, you're making my day.

54:22.044 --> 54:25.297
Well if it's a "hobby",
like you said...

54:25.422 --> 54:28.217
you were always
such a sweet neighbour!

54:28.342 --> 54:30.511
It's so nice to give back, isn't it!

54:32.679 --> 54:34.640
How's life treating you?

54:34.765 --> 54:36.141
How's Steve?

54:38.894 --> 54:40.187
Yawn!

54:40.729 --> 54:42.731
This shit is useless!

54:42.856 --> 54:44.233
We had an agreement.

54:46.485 --> 54:48.904
Agreement my ass.
That was your idea.

54:49.029 --> 54:50.113
I don't give a shit!

54:51.281 --> 54:52.825
The music...

54:52.950 --> 54:54.076
please turn it down.

54:59.498 --> 55:01.124
Where's the fucking O.J.

55:01.250 --> 55:03.085
In this motherfucking house!

55:05.587 --> 55:07.714
We have ten minutes left
out of our thir...

55:08.757 --> 55:09.758
Thirty!

55:10.759 --> 55:12.678
Thirty! Say it, for fuck sake!
Hang in there; you can do it!

55:14.096 --> 55:16.139
Steve... ten minutes!

55:16.932 --> 55:17.850
And then we dance.

55:21.270 --> 55:22.271
Ten minutes.

55:23.188 --> 55:24.982
And then we... we dance.

55:26.775 --> 55:27.985
Please calm down.

55:29.486 --> 55:31.864
Steve! Steve...

55:33.532 --> 55:34.741
No, Steve...

55:34.867 --> 55:36.618
I'm not gonna take this!

55:38.620 --> 55:40.664
Come on, fight me, fucking pussy!

55:41.206 --> 55:43.458
Smack that face!

55:44.293 --> 55:46.336
I'm doing this to help, okay?

55:49.590 --> 55:52.050
Cute girly necklace...

55:55.053 --> 55:56.722
Get off me, bitch!

55:56.847 --> 55:58.807
Shut your mouth!

55:58.932 --> 56:01.268
Shut your fucking mouth!
Get your hands off me!

56:01.393 --> 56:04.479
And give me that necklace back
before I crush your skull!

56:04.605 --> 56:07.649
You got it? You got it now?!

56:09.234 --> 56:11.236
That's what you want, eh?

56:12.321 --> 56:15.240
You love it that way, right?

56:31.214 --> 56:34.259
Do I bring up your dead father?

56:35.302 --> 56:37.220
Do I fucking bring that up?

56:40.891 --> 56:42.893
So shut it tight,

56:43.018 --> 56:46.855
sit your ass on the sofa,
and hold your fucking breath!

57:55.424 --> 57:56.675
Steve...

57:57.175 --> 57:58.927
Just go! I hate you!

58:17.863 --> 58:19.197
<i>Take your time, Diane.</i>

58:19.906 --> 58:21.033
<i>OK.</i>

58:22.451 --> 58:23.326
<i>What?</i>

58:23.702 --> 58:24.828
<i>It's nothing.</i>

58:25.412 --> 58:26.663
Come on, tell me.

58:26.788 --> 58:28.832
No, it's dumb, forget it.

58:28.957 --> 58:30.042
Come on, you tease!

58:30.167 --> 58:31.752
It's dumb...

58:31.877 --> 58:33.253
I'm not at the top of your list--

58:33.378 --> 58:34.713
Come on, you tease!

58:34.838 --> 58:36.757
You sneaky little tease!

58:36.882 --> 58:38.383
- It's dumb, forget it.
- No, no, no!

58:38.508 --> 58:39.760
It's nothing.

58:39.885 --> 58:41.011
Come on!

58:41.136 --> 58:43.138
It was a pleasure catching up.

58:43.263 --> 58:44.181
Tell me!

58:44.306 --> 58:46.058
You won't be disappointed.

58:46.183 --> 58:47.851
You gotta tell me right away.

58:48.560 --> 58:50.312
Tell me now,
cause I'll go to bed thinking,

58:50.437 --> 58:53.148
"Gee, what did she want?
Was it important, was it not imp--"

58:53.273 --> 58:54.858
I need an advance.

59:03.450 --> 59:04.701
$20 bills?

59:05.535 --> 59:08.371
Diane! $20 bills?

59:10.999 --> 59:13.627
Whatever's best for you.
What's it to me...

59:18.965 --> 59:20.217
$20 bills, then.

59:20.967 --> 59:22.427
All in $20 bills, please.

1:00:33.206 --> 1:00:34.833
I'm a good lad, ya know.

1:01:29.763 --> 1:01:31.139
Diane!

1:01:34.559 --> 1:01:35.477
Wait a minute!

1:01:41.816 --> 1:01:43.318
Wait up, lemme help!

1:01:49.824 --> 1:01:51.201
This isn't your day, eh?

1:01:51.660 --> 1:01:56.706
You win some, you lose some,
that's life.

1:02:00.126 --> 1:02:01.211
How are you guys?

1:02:01.670 --> 1:02:02.504
Us guys?

1:02:04.422 --> 1:02:05.632
You and your son.

1:02:06.591 --> 1:02:08.843
Same old, same old.

1:02:09.928 --> 1:02:12.389
And you? You been busy these days?

1:02:13.265 --> 1:02:15.350
There's always something going on
at the municipal court.

1:02:15.892 --> 1:02:17.936
You wouldn't believe the cases I get.

1:02:18.061 --> 1:02:18.979
I can imagine...

1:02:21.022 --> 1:02:22.232
Goddamn...

1:02:23.817 --> 1:02:25.151
Can's broken, awesome.

1:02:26.861 --> 1:02:28.029
Well, lemme tell ya...

1:02:28.822 --> 1:02:29.864
You're one...

1:02:30.407 --> 1:02:31.283
pretty...

1:02:31.700 --> 1:02:32.867
...pretty gal.

1:02:36.037 --> 1:02:39.291
Come on! Dressed up
like a dog's breakfast,

1:02:39.416 --> 1:02:41.418
on all fours, middle of the street!

1:02:41.543 --> 1:02:43.086
Nah, nah, don't try!

1:02:44.629 --> 1:02:46.256
See? That's it!

1:02:46.965 --> 1:02:48.425
That's what's sexy!

1:02:48.550 --> 1:02:49.843
Is you don't even know it.

1:03:00.854 --> 1:03:02.605
You're funny, Paul.

1:03:29.674 --> 1:03:31.634
Spic and span, eh!

1:03:42.479 --> 1:03:44.522
Fuckin' Last House on the Left,
what the hell...

1:04:02.123 --> 1:04:03.541
Are you guys outside?

1:04:06.127 --> 1:04:07.545
Surprise!

1:04:08.755 --> 1:04:12.050
Holy shit! You goddam crazies!
I almost had a heart attack!

1:04:12.175 --> 1:04:14.386
I wanted to piss
so I tied a knot in my dick

1:04:14.511 --> 1:04:16.179
just to see your face!

1:04:16.805 --> 1:04:20.058
We were done with math and chem
so we fixed a snack.

1:04:20.600 --> 1:04:21.976
D'ya notice how her stutter's better?

1:04:22.102 --> 1:04:24.562
That's the Steve touch, baby.

1:04:25.230 --> 1:04:26.564
They just can't effin resist me.

1:04:27.732 --> 1:04:28.775
Forgive him.

1:04:33.947 --> 1:04:35.448
Well, can I give a hand?

1:04:36.324 --> 1:04:39.494
Table's set, food's served, Jesus!

1:04:39.619 --> 1:04:40.829
You can relax.

1:04:40.954 --> 1:04:42.455
Relax, breathe!

1:04:45.542 --> 1:04:46.626
Can he?

1:04:46.751 --> 1:04:49.712
Look... what happens in Vegas...

1:04:54.426 --> 1:04:56.386
Well... thank you, Kyla!
Thank you!

1:04:58.179 --> 1:04:59.597
And I'm a piece of shit?

1:05:06.563 --> 1:05:09.232
You're no piece of shit, hell no...

1:05:15.780 --> 1:05:19.242
You're a prince, baby!
That's what you are!

1:05:19.742 --> 1:05:22.370
And we fixed you a royal brunch!

1:05:22.495 --> 1:05:25.373
We live like goddamn kings!
Is this Versailles or what?

1:05:25.498 --> 1:05:27.208
Have you seen this?

1:05:27.333 --> 1:05:28.877
Versailles!

1:05:29.002 --> 1:05:32.297
Those baloney rolls
are screaming my name!

1:05:33.089 --> 1:05:34.799
You guys, let's take a pic!
Come on.

1:05:34.924 --> 1:05:36.134
Let's do it, guys.

1:05:37.427 --> 1:05:40.138
You come here. Come, Kyla.
- Wait...

1:05:41.014 --> 1:05:42.640
But my hair...

1:05:43.141 --> 1:05:44.559
Your hair's sick.

1:05:44.684 --> 1:05:46.144
But that light's harsh, Stevo...

1:05:46.478 --> 1:05:48.438
Let's switch sides, alright...

1:06:20.053 --> 1:06:21.888
<i>We found out in March.</i>

1:06:23.056 --> 1:06:24.599
<i>End of March 2010.</i>

1:06:28.102 --> 1:06:30.396
Three weeks later,
I was signing papers for his casket.

1:06:30.522 --> 1:06:31.397
Bingo!

1:06:32.649 --> 1:06:34.108
That was something.

1:06:34.943 --> 1:06:37.862
First off, we moved.

1:06:38.655 --> 1:06:40.198
Left the burbs.

1:06:41.074 --> 1:06:43.618
Rich was up to his neck in debt.

1:06:43.743 --> 1:06:45.787
I sold the house,

1:06:45.912 --> 1:06:48.665
paid the bills,
set the counter straight.

1:06:49.123 --> 1:06:51.960
And that's when Steve...

1:06:52.085 --> 1:06:55.421
Vandalism, petty theft,
the crying and cursing...

1:06:55.547 --> 1:06:57.423
All that bullshit.

1:06:59.467 --> 1:07:04.055
Then he got diagnosed
and I placed him.

1:07:04.180 --> 1:07:05.348
I mean, I placed him.

1:07:08.309 --> 1:07:12.272
And what about you?
I did ask you before, didn't I?

1:07:12.981 --> 1:07:16.359
You used to live in Quebec City?
Why did y'all move here?

1:07:26.327 --> 1:07:27.579
I know Quebec, you know.

1:07:28.079 --> 1:07:31.165
We often went for Richard's job.
I always ended up there.

1:07:36.254 --> 1:07:38.089
What did Richard do?

1:07:40.049 --> 1:07:43.261
He worked in the inventors business.

1:07:43.970 --> 1:07:46.848
He...
He invented...

1:07:46.973 --> 1:07:48.182
I never really got it but...

1:07:48.308 --> 1:07:49.517
I mean, I did but anyway...

1:07:49.642 --> 1:07:52.812
It was a microwave thingy...

1:07:54.731 --> 1:07:57.191
He named it the Heater-Waver.

1:07:58.776 --> 1:08:00.612
You know it?

1:08:00.737 --> 1:08:03.156
The Heater-Waver, yes!

1:08:03.281 --> 1:08:06.159
Get outta here!
No effin way!

1:08:06.284 --> 1:08:08.036
It did good, yeah, it was a hit!

1:08:08.161 --> 1:08:10.955
Everyone had the Heater-Waver!
My sister, my sister-in-law!

1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:12.290
Really?

1:08:12.415 --> 1:08:13.458
Well, hello!

1:08:14.292 --> 1:08:17.462
We made a shitload of money
on that one, but it didn't last...

1:08:18.254 --> 1:08:20.965
Richie started thinking big,
next thing, I was thinking big...

1:08:21.090 --> 1:08:23.718
Of course... it was big!

1:08:23.843 --> 1:08:27.013
We all did, but better think big
than small, am I right or what?!

1:08:27.513 --> 1:08:30.391
And then...
the Americans called.

1:08:30.516 --> 1:08:33.478
- Americans are never far...
- They know best, don't they...

1:08:33.603 --> 1:08:34.979
When there's money to be made!

1:08:35.104 --> 1:08:38.608
So they got their hands on it...
and that's that.

1:08:38.733 --> 1:08:40.068
Effin bunch of crooks!

1:08:41.778 --> 1:08:44.030
Yup.
What's done is done.

1:09:00.672 --> 1:09:04.634
Are you looking for a job?

1:09:07.011 --> 1:09:10.598
One of my friends gave me
some translation gig.

1:09:10.723 --> 1:09:13.101
Not really my job, but...

1:09:14.352 --> 1:09:17.271
at least I'll make it
to the holidays, now...

1:09:18.940 --> 1:09:22.068
I mean, Christmas' right around
the corner... But then there's...

1:09:23.820 --> 1:09:27.448
All that clutter in the basement.
The old furniture.

1:09:27.573 --> 1:09:29.784
I've got no room for that here.

1:09:30.410 --> 1:09:31.661
And it's from another life...

1:09:31.786 --> 1:09:33.371
it's got nothing
to do with me anymore.

1:09:35.123 --> 1:09:38.292
I was thinking I could...
you know... sell it.

1:09:38.418 --> 1:09:42.797
Like a sort of
garage sale type-a-thing...

1:09:43.881 --> 1:09:45.550
I don't know what it's worth but...

1:09:47.343 --> 1:09:50.763
Must be worth something, at least.
Fancy dinner or some night out...

1:09:50.888 --> 1:09:53.433
Makes a lil' bundle of dough...
Bundle here, bundle there...

1:09:53.558 --> 1:09:54.892
We'll end up going somewhere!

1:09:58.229 --> 1:09:59.897
That little wine's not bad, eh?

1:10:00.940 --> 1:10:04.485
And you... is there anyone?
Anyone special, I mean?

1:10:06.446 --> 1:10:07.655
I'm a jingle lady!

1:10:11.033 --> 1:10:12.618
Sorry.

1:10:12.744 --> 1:10:15.580
I meant single.

1:10:15.705 --> 1:10:17.915
I'm surprised.
You're so pretty!

1:10:18.916 --> 1:10:20.042
You're pretty, Die.

1:10:20.168 --> 1:10:21.794
You're real sweet, but...

1:10:23.087 --> 1:10:26.466
Pretty won't getcha any!

1:10:27.300 --> 1:10:28.509
Life's like poker:

1:10:29.093 --> 1:10:30.970
If you ain't got a good pair,
you're in deep shit!

1:10:43.107 --> 1:10:44.776
Time to flat call, I guess!

1:10:48.613 --> 1:10:50.615
No hooters, no poker!

1:10:50.740 --> 1:10:53.493
Might as well play with myself!

1:10:56.412 --> 1:10:58.498
Or watch some TV!

1:10:59.165 --> 1:11:02.877
I don't even have a TV!
No TV, no candy, sweet fuck all!

1:11:03.795 --> 1:11:06.005
No bazookas in my 34A!

1:11:06.130 --> 1:11:07.840
But a big one in my mouth!

1:11:11.093 --> 1:11:13.429
Tastes good!
They're my favourite!

1:11:14.889 --> 1:11:16.098
That one was effin huge!

1:11:16.224 --> 1:11:18.726
Quite the mission!

1:11:20.603 --> 1:11:22.271
I got cramps in my face!

1:11:23.439 --> 1:11:25.191
I'mma help it down the drain!

1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:33.491
Stop it, Die!

1:11:33.825 --> 1:11:34.909
Sorry!

1:11:35.618 --> 1:11:37.870
You're gonna kill me, Die!

1:11:39.413 --> 1:11:40.998
Do you get it?

1:12:16.367 --> 1:12:18.995
Holy fuck!
Should've seen your face!

1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:20.746
You scared me...

1:12:22.206 --> 1:12:24.250
It's just me.
Don't worry, babe.

1:12:27.545 --> 1:12:29.422
Don't call me babe.

1:12:29.547 --> 1:12:31.132
'Ight. I won't.

1:12:34.427 --> 1:12:35.469
It's okay.

1:12:38.598 --> 1:12:40.308
Are you done with
your history homework?

1:12:40.433 --> 1:12:42.018
I was just about to,

1:12:42.143 --> 1:12:45.062
but I can't see shit
'cause of the blackout.

1:12:48.024 --> 1:12:48.941
There.

1:13:02.830 --> 1:13:05.082
I'm a fucking pro, eh?

1:13:06.542 --> 1:13:07.668
Mom?

1:13:08.544 --> 1:13:12.715
Dad wants to know where you put
the candles and flashlights.

1:13:20.181 --> 1:13:23.517
They're in a box in the basement.
He knows where!

1:13:24.727 --> 1:13:25.978
Thank you.

1:13:29.565 --> 1:13:30.942
I meant to tell ya...

1:13:33.361 --> 1:13:34.487
about earlier...

1:13:35.154 --> 1:13:37.156
about this morning.
I wanted to apologize, first.

1:13:38.532 --> 1:13:40.242
I'm sorry and...

1:13:45.790 --> 1:13:47.750
I like it when you teach me stuff.

1:13:49.502 --> 1:13:54.173
And... I get it
when you explain shit to me.

1:13:55.549 --> 1:13:57.635
For that reason,

1:13:57.760 --> 1:14:00.680
it makes me wanna ask you,
do you wanna keep doing it?

1:14:04.934 --> 1:14:07.353
Mom!
Dinner's ready!

1:14:14.193 --> 1:14:15.945
Thanks, I'm coming.

1:14:17.446 --> 1:14:19.740
That way...

1:14:19.865 --> 1:14:22.493
I could pass my exams
at the end of the year, and...

1:14:22.994 --> 1:14:24.620
'cause when I'm old enough,

1:14:24.745 --> 1:14:28.541
I'll apply to an Art school,
in the States.

1:14:28.666 --> 1:14:29.750
Juilliard.

1:14:32.128 --> 1:14:34.505
And I think Die likes you.

1:14:34.630 --> 1:14:36.966
We like you, we're chill.

1:14:37.842 --> 1:14:40.302
You're on sabbatical
so if you stay with me,

1:14:40.428 --> 1:14:44.348
she could find a day job
and we'd get it going again.

1:14:49.770 --> 1:14:57.770
I don't mean to interrupt
but the food's gonna get cold!

1:17:47.531 --> 1:17:48.991
Show me!

1:17:57.750 --> 1:17:58.834
Come back here, you dork!

1:17:58.959 --> 1:18:00.544
Get your ass here!

1:18:02.379 --> 1:18:04.506
Chill out!

1:18:05.841 --> 1:18:08.260
You goddamn stupid punk!
I'mma come and getcha!

1:18:14.767 --> 1:18:16.352
What the hell are you doing?!

1:18:21.023 --> 1:18:23.025
Stop encouraging him!

1:18:23.150 --> 1:18:25.486
I'm trying to raise that kid!

1:18:32.868 --> 1:18:34.328
I'm free!

1:18:34.912 --> 1:18:37.122
I am free!

1:18:43.170 --> 1:18:45.130
D'you like it al dente?

1:18:45.256 --> 1:18:47.716
I'm from a special school of thought.

1:18:47.841 --> 1:18:52.471
I like my pasta just a tiny tiny bit
harder than al dente.

1:18:52.596 --> 1:18:54.098
Well, it's al dente now!

1:18:54.223 --> 1:18:56.642
Strain them, illico pesto!

1:18:57.268 --> 1:19:00.229
- Fail! Keep your day job, please!
- Why don't ya shut it!

1:19:01.188 --> 1:19:03.691
Says here the mayo
may contain mustard.

1:19:03.816 --> 1:19:06.193
Yeah, they always write that BS,
even for cookies!

1:19:06.318 --> 1:19:07.111
I hate fucking mustard.

1:19:07.444 --> 1:19:10.239
Just put two spoonfuls, just two.

1:19:11.073 --> 1:19:12.032
What the...?

1:19:13.033 --> 1:19:15.577
Don't put the dressing yet,
it'll make the lettuce soggy.

1:19:15.703 --> 1:19:17.871
Kyla, start 'em pine nuts!
On low.

1:19:17.997 --> 1:19:19.456
So they don't burn!

1:19:24.044 --> 1:19:26.380
You've been served, ma'am.

1:19:27.131 --> 1:19:28.340
Good evening.

1:19:43.272 --> 1:19:45.649
It may contain traces of mustard.

1:19:46.233 --> 1:19:48.652
<i>...your son...</i>

1:19:48.777 --> 1:19:52.281
<i>...set fire to the cafeteria...</i>

1:19:52.406 --> 1:19:54.366
<i>This fire caused physical
and moral damages...</i>

1:19:54.491 --> 1:19:56.035
Pine nuts are ready!

1:19:56.160 --> 1:19:58.287
Take 'em out of the pan
so they won't burn!

1:19:59.038 --> 1:20:00.289
<i>...to our son Kevin Julien.</i>

1:20:00.414 --> 1:20:02.291
Put the lid on, so they stay moist.

1:20:05.252 --> 1:20:06.211
<i>75% of his face...</i>

1:20:06.337 --> 1:20:07.629
<i>...skin graft...</i>

1:20:07.755 --> 1:20:09.214
Can we change the subject?

1:20:12.092 --> 1:20:14.511
<i>Please act accordingly.</i>

1:20:44.291 --> 1:20:45.667
Pour the dressing.

1:20:45.793 --> 1:20:49.838
Stop poking my face with that shit!

1:20:49.963 --> 1:20:51.215
I'mma look like a slut!

1:20:51.340 --> 1:20:53.258
You already look like one!

1:20:54.009 --> 1:20:54.885
Stop it!

1:20:55.928 --> 1:20:57.679
That sweater's way too small.

1:20:57.805 --> 1:21:00.432
It's got a big spot, like you
slept in a pile of shit.

1:21:00.557 --> 1:21:01.934
Pile of shit, yourself!

1:21:02.059 --> 1:21:03.560
Mind your own, kiss ass!

1:21:03.894 --> 1:21:06.522
Is the kid that set the canteen
on fire a pile of shit?

1:21:06.647 --> 1:21:08.524
The kid whose mom's
meeting with the neighbour

1:21:08.649 --> 1:21:10.067
who's helping for free

1:21:10.401 --> 1:21:12.277
so you don't end up
at George-Étienne Lemieux?

1:21:12.403 --> 1:21:14.947
- I'm not going back!
- I know, you dumb-ass!

1:21:15.072 --> 1:21:17.282
But for fuck's sake,
we gotta lawyer our asses up.

1:21:17.408 --> 1:21:19.326
We can't just sit and wait for God

1:21:19.451 --> 1:21:21.912
to come down on an effin cloud!

1:21:22.037 --> 1:21:24.623
I have a bird-nest on my head!

1:21:25.207 --> 1:21:26.166
I'm not a tumbleweed!

1:21:26.291 --> 1:21:27.668
Wait...

1:21:28.544 --> 1:21:29.753
I'm getting there.

1:21:29.878 --> 1:21:30.838
I know.

1:21:38.846 --> 1:21:41.432
Fucking douche.

1:21:42.975 --> 1:21:45.269
10 max, I'm peacing out.

1:21:45.894 --> 1:21:49.189
No one's pissing till I say so.

1:21:49.314 --> 1:21:51.275
Steve, you have to do it.

1:21:51.400 --> 1:21:54.278
2-3 hours of your precious time,
suck it up.

1:21:54.403 --> 1:21:55.362
Fuck that shit!

1:21:56.155 --> 1:21:58.449
I'm done with that dirty mouth!
Fuck fuck fuck!

1:21:58.574 --> 1:21:59.575
Back off!

1:21:59.700 --> 1:22:01.368
I've had it 'bout up to here!

1:22:01.493 --> 1:22:04.163
We'll make a good impression tonight!

1:22:04.288 --> 1:22:06.582
Are you blind or you just dumb!

1:22:06.707 --> 1:22:10.627
That dick doesn't wanna help us,
he just wants in your panties!

1:22:23.056 --> 1:22:24.433
We'll be right out!

1:22:24.558 --> 1:22:25.809
No problemo!

1:22:29.062 --> 1:22:31.648
As usual...
Thank you.

1:22:36.570 --> 1:22:37.571
Good luck.

1:22:37.696 --> 1:22:38.947
We'll do what we can.

1:22:41.950 --> 1:22:43.827
You coming, cutie?

1:22:47.873 --> 1:22:48.999
You wait!

1:22:50.167 --> 1:22:51.126
Stay here.

1:22:54.755 --> 1:22:56.757
There's no two ways about it.

1:22:57.883 --> 1:22:59.801
Mom's got a couple gigs
here and there

1:22:59.927 --> 1:23:01.637
for bills and groceries.

1:23:02.763 --> 1:23:04.806
Not a lawsuit, not a lawyer.

1:23:06.141 --> 1:23:09.019
If we don't defend ourselves...

1:23:13.232 --> 1:23:14.775
We gotta put some water
in our wine...

1:23:15.817 --> 1:23:16.985
Huh, baby?

1:23:17.569 --> 1:23:20.280
Ever heard that expression?

1:23:22.407 --> 1:23:26.787
We stick together, tonight.
Mom's there for ya, and vice versa.

1:23:30.916 --> 1:23:31.792
We good?

1:23:49.810 --> 1:23:50.936
Wheeeeretoooooo!

1:23:52.938 --> 1:23:53.939
Alrighty!

1:23:54.815 --> 1:23:57.526
It's scary,
how nothing's changed here.

1:23:57.651 --> 1:24:00.862
That secret sauce
is what scares me!

1:24:00.988 --> 1:24:02.573
Those freaking secrets scare me.

1:24:03.490 --> 1:24:05.242
I don't get it.

1:24:05.826 --> 1:24:06.952
I just don't.

1:24:07.786 --> 1:24:09.496
I don't get them burgers!

1:24:09.621 --> 1:24:11.707
Who's into that stuff
except for tourists

1:24:11.832 --> 1:24:13.417
who've never seen flat bread?

1:24:13.917 --> 1:24:17.379
I was surprised
you brought up that place.

1:24:18.505 --> 1:24:22.843
Who'd be into swaggy homemade burgers

1:24:22.968 --> 1:24:24.886
with nice hot sauce

1:24:25.012 --> 1:24:29.349
and melting cheddar
when you got that effin orange cheese

1:24:29.474 --> 1:24:32.936
from some obese-packed
American dive, eh?

1:24:33.895 --> 1:24:36.690
I guess my dad was just
some random tourist.

1:24:41.778 --> 1:24:45.490
He sure knows how to liven it up.

1:24:55.417 --> 1:24:58.170
I hope you like karaoke, Steve.

1:24:58.295 --> 1:25:01.131
'Cause I got it all planned out!

1:25:01.256 --> 1:25:02.966
You kidding, we love it!

1:25:03.091 --> 1:25:05.177
I told ya on the phone, he sings!

1:25:05.302 --> 1:25:06.845
I don't sing, I dance!

1:25:08.430 --> 1:25:10.724
You can do both at once,
you're no dummy.

1:25:12.684 --> 1:25:16.938
You gonna smack like a cow
without manners all night, or what?

1:25:20.233 --> 1:25:23.278
Wait until I sing Eye of the Tiger,

1:25:23.403 --> 1:25:25.238
you'll loosen up.

1:25:26.448 --> 1:25:28.950
Freakin' blast from the past!

1:25:29.534 --> 1:25:31.286
I've been hooked since '82.

1:25:32.329 --> 1:25:35.832
I saw it maybe 11 times,

1:25:35.957 --> 1:25:37.834
and I keep forgetting how it ends!

1:25:39.836 --> 1:25:42.214
I have the Scarf ace poster
on my fridge.

1:25:45.133 --> 1:25:47.260
But about...

1:25:48.011 --> 1:25:51.056
about Steve...

1:25:51.932 --> 1:25:54.393
'Cause our Steve here got himself...

1:25:56.395 --> 1:25:58.897
in a fine mess...

1:26:00.774 --> 1:26:01.858
He's a pro.

1:26:03.110 --> 1:26:05.278
It's about time we...

1:26:06.113 --> 1:26:08.990
get to the bottom of things...

1:26:23.088 --> 1:26:27.384
- Whatcha gonna sing tonight, Steve?
- Yeah, what?

1:26:40.188 --> 1:26:44.860
Get the fuck out!
I just can't believe it!

1:26:44.985 --> 1:26:47.028
Eyes like this, jaw-dropped!

1:26:47.154 --> 1:26:49.197
He's standing frozen,
drooling on the floor.

1:26:49.322 --> 1:26:52.367
Poor girl's got her money's worth!

1:26:53.076 --> 1:26:55.495
Her dude shows up,
middle of the night!

1:26:55.620 --> 1:26:57.289
Busts her with the stripper,

1:26:57.414 --> 1:26:59.583
his schlong
sticking outta his speedo!

1:27:01.084 --> 1:27:02.711
One big schlong!

1:27:03.044 --> 1:27:04.171
Steve, buddy?

1:27:05.088 --> 1:27:06.465
What's our song, kiddo!

1:27:07.799 --> 1:27:08.842
You know what?

1:27:08.967 --> 1:27:10.552
Why don't we pick a song,

1:27:10.677 --> 1:27:12.179
and sing your mom some duet,

1:27:12.304 --> 1:27:14.139
a beautiful song
for a beautiful woman.

1:27:19.060 --> 1:27:23.106
Hey Missy! Same thing, here!
Die, seconds?

1:27:23.231 --> 1:27:24.107
Bring it on!

1:27:24.232 --> 1:27:26.151
Make that two!

1:27:26.485 --> 1:27:27.486
Thanks!

1:27:27.611 --> 1:27:29.738
So... my dear Paul...

1:27:32.491 --> 1:27:36.953
About Steve and that whole shebang,

1:27:37.078 --> 1:27:40.791
we better talk it through
before we're too wasted to speak!

1:27:41.416 --> 1:27:43.084
I'm never too wasted.

1:27:43.794 --> 1:27:45.629
Seriously, Paul,

1:27:45.754 --> 1:27:48.840
could you direct...

1:27:51.510 --> 1:27:53.887
our direction...

1:27:54.012 --> 1:27:57.057
in this crazy whatchamacallit?

1:27:57.182 --> 1:27:58.892
The only thing you gotta know

1:27:59.017 --> 1:28:01.102
is that when it comes to a lawsuit,

1:28:02.395 --> 1:28:06.191
it's all about the angle.
- Oh, yeah...

1:28:06.316 --> 1:28:08.068
What's your angle?

1:28:08.193 --> 1:28:10.153
Is it this one?

1:28:10.278 --> 1:28:11.196
Or this one?

1:28:11.321 --> 1:28:13.156
I dunno, you're the boss!

1:28:13.281 --> 1:28:14.115
Or this one?

1:28:14.241 --> 1:28:15.784
That ain't the same!

1:28:16.243 --> 1:28:17.619
That's another one!

1:28:17.744 --> 1:28:19.621
It's fragile, but it's the angle.

1:28:19.746 --> 1:28:23.625
Seriously, drop by my place
tomorrow morning.

1:28:23.750 --> 1:28:26.336
Doesn't feel right talking about it
with Steve around,

1:28:26.461 --> 1:28:28.588
we should be partying,
kicking back a few!

1:28:28.922 --> 1:28:30.507
Are you a cottage kinda girl?

1:28:30.632 --> 1:28:35.095
Well, cottage, just like that, eh?

1:28:35.220 --> 1:28:39.099
My cottage yeah, we could go
for a day, or two, or three

1:28:39.516 --> 1:28:43.061
whenever I don't have my daughter
and you uh... I dunno...

1:28:43.186 --> 1:28:44.020
I dunno...

1:29:07.419 --> 1:29:10.964
- Hey, you got Vivo Per Lei?
- Huh?

1:29:11.089 --> 1:29:12.299
Vivo Per Lei, the song.

1:29:12.424 --> 1:29:15.552
Andrea Bocelli, yup, I have it.

1:29:15.677 --> 1:29:19.347
You have the duet version,
the guy and the girl?

1:29:19.472 --> 1:29:21.975
- I do.
- You wouldn't sing it with me, eh?

1:29:22.100 --> 1:29:24.144
Sure! Could be fun!

1:29:24.477 --> 1:29:26.229
Go on, I'll be right up.
- Thanks.

1:29:44.456 --> 1:29:47.000
Hey, it's our International Steve!

1:29:48.001 --> 1:29:49.753
Steve's the shy type but,

1:29:49.878 --> 1:29:52.714
give him some time
and he's stealing the show!

1:29:53.381 --> 1:29:57.260
Steve's the mingle-type.

1:30:14.694 --> 1:30:18.531
I'm sure that ain't a favorite here!

1:30:20.283 --> 1:30:21.993
Canada's got talent, eh!

1:30:23.828 --> 1:30:26.081
Who's that homo!

1:30:58.863 --> 1:31:00.407
Check this out, guys!

1:31:46.453 --> 1:31:50.040
Sing, faggot, sing!

1:32:22.197 --> 1:32:25.575
You lemme sing my song
and shut your fucking cunt!

1:32:25.700 --> 1:32:29.370
You lemme sing
or I'mma fucking rip your face!

1:32:29.496 --> 1:32:32.123
- Chill out, man!
- Fuck off, asshole!

1:32:32.248 --> 1:32:33.666
Steve, stop right now!

1:32:33.792 --> 1:32:37.253
Motherfucker!
I'mma fucking kill you, ok!

1:32:39.506 --> 1:32:43.927
You punks get the fuck outta my sight
before I call the pigs!

1:32:44.052 --> 1:32:46.179
Come on, scram!

1:32:48.056 --> 1:32:50.391
- Steve, come here!
- I'm going home!

1:32:50.517 --> 1:32:53.311
Do what you want.
Fuck him, I don't give a shit.

1:32:53.436 --> 1:32:56.106
Listen to your Mom, come here,
we'll talk like adults.

1:32:56.231 --> 1:32:58.691
Adults who chugged 27 beers?
No thanks.

1:32:58.817 --> 1:33:01.486
We're doing this for you, son,
not for me!

1:33:01.611 --> 1:33:03.363
You're the one in trouble
with the law,

1:33:03.488 --> 1:33:04.697
we're looking for solutions here!

1:33:04.823 --> 1:33:06.407
In a Karaoke bar?

1:33:06.533 --> 1:33:08.868
Wake up, Diane,
he just wants to bone you!

1:33:08.993 --> 1:33:12.122
Hey you watch your mouth!
We're older than you!

1:33:12.247 --> 1:33:13.289
Older my ass!

1:33:13.414 --> 1:33:14.457
Stop it, Steve!

1:33:15.125 --> 1:33:18.461
Why? So I can sing while
that gaylord rubs his dick on ya!

1:33:18.586 --> 1:33:20.255
That's enough, you little shit!

1:33:20.380 --> 1:33:21.506
Don't start!

1:33:22.132 --> 1:33:23.925
- Watch your goddam mouth with her!
- We're all drunk--

1:33:24.050 --> 1:33:26.302
D'you even hear yourself?
Who d'you think you are?

1:33:26.427 --> 1:33:30.348
She's going through hell for ya!
Because of ya!

1:33:30.473 --> 1:33:33.685
She gives you everything,
her cash, her time, her whole life!

1:33:33.810 --> 1:33:36.020
And how d'you thank her, tonight?

1:33:36.146 --> 1:33:38.815
Spit in my face and start a brawl!

1:33:38.940 --> 1:33:40.024
Go fuck yourself bitch

1:33:40.150 --> 1:33:42.402
with your lame-ass shitty lawyer job!

1:33:42.527 --> 1:33:44.529
Come on! You just want
my mom to suck your cock--

1:33:45.488 --> 1:33:47.365
Motherfucker!

1:33:53.079 --> 1:33:55.582
Choke on your fucking loser problems.

1:33:55.707 --> 1:33:58.251
Yeah, get the fuck outta here!

1:34:00.837 --> 1:34:02.881
Fuck off!

1:34:10.763 --> 1:34:11.848
That guy...

1:34:13.391 --> 1:34:17.103
was gonna help us, you idiot.

1:34:17.645 --> 1:34:19.147
Help you.

1:34:19.272 --> 1:34:21.482
No one can help us.
They're all the same!

1:34:21.608 --> 1:34:24.611
It's just the two of us,
fuck the rest of 'em!

1:34:24.736 --> 1:34:27.071
I don't have any problems, alright?

1:34:27.197 --> 1:34:30.200
You know what my big problem is? You.

1:34:30.325 --> 1:34:33.745
No more job because of you.
No money! No life!

1:34:33.870 --> 1:34:36.080
Meds, bail, correctional centres,

1:34:36.206 --> 1:34:37.498
and now a lawsuit!

1:34:37.624 --> 1:34:40.919
Will someone gimme a fucking break?

1:34:41.044 --> 1:34:44.380
No! Steve-O, ladies and gentlemen!

1:34:44.505 --> 1:34:46.132
A break? What the fuck for!

1:34:46.257 --> 1:34:48.426
Dream on, Die, dream on!

1:34:49.052 --> 1:34:50.929
Daddy dug the grave,
sonny keeps digging!

1:34:51.054 --> 1:34:54.724
And I'm singing in the rain!
And it just goes on and on and on,

1:34:54.849 --> 1:34:57.685
'cause ya always find
a fucking brilliant way

1:34:57.810 --> 1:35:00.730
so it hits the fan full effin blast!

1:35:00.855 --> 1:35:03.024
And I just keep cleaning
the shit off the walls!

1:35:03.149 --> 1:35:08.029
Come on, wipe the retard's ass!
Just wipe that effin retard's ass!

1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:29.000
Now...

1:37:09.067 --> 1:37:10.360
What can I do for you?

1:37:11.402 --> 1:37:12.862
Where were you?

1:37:16.783 --> 1:37:17.658
When?

1:37:19.619 --> 1:37:21.079
When d'ya think?

1:37:23.039 --> 1:37:24.457
I was sleeping.

1:37:58.825 --> 1:38:00.284
Maybe, one day...

1:38:03.621 --> 1:38:05.248
you won't love me anymore.

1:38:07.667 --> 1:38:09.085
It's true.

1:38:10.002 --> 1:38:11.045
It happens.

1:38:15.675 --> 1:38:16.676
Me...

1:38:17.969 --> 1:38:19.762
I'll always be there for you.

1:38:21.347 --> 1:38:22.640
You...

1:38:23.724 --> 1:38:24.976
You're my priority.

1:39:02.054 --> 1:39:04.348
Aisle 2, aisle 3...
Jesus Christ!

1:39:04.474 --> 1:39:06.309
Is it too much
to put fucking signs up!

1:39:06.934 --> 1:39:09.312
Calm down, we'll find it.

1:39:09.812 --> 1:39:14.233
He's on a high. Some bad phase.
That ain't in the budget right now.

1:39:15.109 --> 1:39:16.444
- What?
- Don't touch anything!

1:39:16.986 --> 1:39:18.488
All phases have an end,

1:39:19.071 --> 1:39:20.281
he'll mellow out soon...

1:39:20.406 --> 1:39:23.242
Here, take half my list

1:39:23.367 --> 1:39:25.119
so we can get outta here.

1:39:25.244 --> 1:39:26.204
I'm going that way.

1:39:26.871 --> 1:39:27.955
Don't touch anything!

1:39:28.414 --> 1:39:30.917
I don't know your mom
like you do, but...

1:39:31.375 --> 1:39:33.377
I know what being a mom's like.

1:39:34.295 --> 1:39:36.589
She doesn't mean any harm.

1:39:36.714 --> 1:39:38.799
It's her fear talking.

1:39:39.342 --> 1:39:40.593
Fear drives people.

1:39:41.010 --> 1:39:43.387
I don't give a shit if she don't
want me anymore.

1:39:43.763 --> 1:39:47.016
Doesn't. She does want you with her.
Come on, please.

1:39:48.184 --> 1:39:49.727
You have to refocus.

1:39:50.853 --> 1:39:54.065
We'll focus on grades 10 and 11 ,
and then...

1:39:54.690 --> 1:39:55.858
when the time comes...

1:39:57.109 --> 1:39:59.362
we'll apply to Juilliard.

1:39:59.987 --> 1:40:03.658
One day we'll get a nice letter

1:40:03.783 --> 1:40:05.201
in a nice envelope,

1:40:05.326 --> 1:40:07.328
and your mom will be so proud.

1:41:17.815 --> 1:41:18.649
You can do it.

1:41:25.573 --> 1:41:27.783
Just say the fucking words.

1:41:33.456 --> 1:41:34.290
What?

1:41:40.004 --> 1:41:41.797
The hell d'you do?

1:41:48.596 --> 1:41:49.639
Come on...

1:41:55.978 --> 1:41:58.522
We still love each other, right?

1:41:59.106 --> 1:42:02.652
That's what we best at, buddy!
Let's go, c'mere!

1:42:03.194 --> 1:42:11.194
Grab the feet, Kyla.

1:45:07.419 --> 1:45:08.629
Are you coming home late?

1:45:11.465 --> 1:45:15.636
Are you cooking
or should I order?

1:45:23.394 --> 1:45:25.604
I'll be home for dinner
but order, yeah.

1:45:26.146 --> 1:45:27.940
I won't be in the mood.

1:45:28.732 --> 1:45:32.736
The box below contains 4 balls...

1:45:34.697 --> 1:45:37.157
Numbered from 1 to 4.

1:45:37.283 --> 1:45:42.872
Successively draw two balls
from the box without replacement.

1:45:43.455 --> 1:45:44.707
Balls...

1:45:46.667 --> 1:45:50.129
You don't return
the first ball in the box

1:45:50.254 --> 1:45:52.172
before drawing the second one.

1:45:52.631 --> 1:45:53.549
Balls...

1:45:56.677 --> 1:45:58.095
Go on.

1:45:58.554 --> 1:45:59.179
The result--

1:46:00.222 --> 1:46:01.932
What's that sexy white car
doing in my driveway?

1:46:14.278 --> 1:46:15.487
D'you like it?

1:46:16.655 --> 1:46:18.032
Where to, miss?

1:46:18.157 --> 1:46:20.743
It's got an ass-heater.

1:46:21.160 --> 1:46:22.328
See the button?

1:46:43.015 --> 1:46:46.060
A mother doesn't wake up one morning
not loving her son.

1:46:46.936 --> 1:46:48.228
Do you get that?

1:46:51.440 --> 1:46:52.524
Yeah, whatev...

1:46:56.070 --> 1:46:58.030
The only thing that's gonna happen...

1:46:59.365 --> 1:47:01.700
is I'll love you more and more.

1:47:04.453 --> 1:47:07.122
And you'll be the one loving me
less and less, but...

1:47:11.752 --> 1:47:13.420
Life works that way.

1:47:14.797 --> 1:47:16.382
We deal with it.

1:47:17.132 --> 1:47:20.803
It's the natural order of things,
you'll get that one day, bud.

1:47:22.554 --> 1:47:24.390
You know what I'm saying?

1:47:24.515 --> 1:47:25.975
D'you understand?

1:47:36.652 --> 1:47:38.696
D'ya pack your bags like I asked?

1:47:44.243 --> 1:47:46.203
D'you pack your shit or what?

1:47:51.500 --> 1:47:52.626
Don't tickle me!

1:47:56.964 --> 1:47:58.632
Don't forget the sandwiches!

1:47:59.800 --> 1:48:01.343
Look what I found in the fridge!

1:48:02.094 --> 1:48:03.012
Look!

1:48:03.721 --> 1:48:05.556
How the fuck is that my problem?

1:48:06.932 --> 1:48:08.517
Back door locked, eh?

1:48:15.899 --> 1:48:17.901
It's gonna be an effin trip!

1:48:18.027 --> 1:48:19.820
Do you want this with you, Die?

1:48:19.945 --> 1:48:21.238
Yeah, not in the trunk.

1:48:27.286 --> 1:48:28.829
We got everything?

1:48:29.163 --> 1:48:37.163
Didn't forget anything?

1:53:27.085 --> 1:53:28.086
It's green.

1:53:29.421 --> 1:53:30.339
You okay?

1:53:47.230 --> 1:53:48.857
I gotta use the washroom.

1:53:56.823 --> 1:53:58.033
Let's try this place.

1:55:18.029 --> 1:55:20.031
Mom's pissing?

1:55:43.013 --> 1:55:44.598
Am I squishing you?

1:56:59.089 --> 1:57:01.174
You motherfucking bitch from hell!

1:57:01.967 --> 1:57:03.718
Take it easy! Take it easy!

1:57:04.094 --> 1:57:05.679
Back off, asshole!

1:57:06.346 --> 1:57:08.848
Don't touch me, don't talk to me!
- Chill out, bro!

1:57:21.027 --> 1:57:22.988
- Easy, easy, easy...
- Relax, we're here to help.

1:57:24.739 --> 1:57:26.866
Why you doing this to me,
you bitch!

1:57:26.992 --> 1:57:29.828
It's for you own good, sweetie!

1:57:30.412 --> 1:57:32.372
My own good, you fucking traitor!

1:57:33.206 --> 1:57:35.542
You dump me here like goddamn trash!

1:57:35.667 --> 1:57:37.961
You got sick of me!
You're done with me!

1:57:44.217 --> 1:57:46.386
Don't be violent, Steve.
There's no point.

1:57:46.511 --> 1:57:49.055
Shut up!
You gonna taze my ass, bitch!

1:57:49.180 --> 1:57:51.474
You want 'em
to fucking electrocute me!

1:57:56.855 --> 1:58:00.233
I won't touch you if you come
in the hospital without resisting.

1:58:00.942 --> 1:58:02.569
No! I ain't mad!

1:58:02.694 --> 1:58:04.821
I ain't goin in a hospital!
Do I look fucking crazy?

1:58:04.946 --> 1:58:06.197
No one here's crazy, pal.

1:58:06.531 --> 1:58:10.035
Stop it! No! I won't go! Mom!

1:58:10.785 --> 1:58:12.662
I don't wanna go! I won't!

1:58:14.122 --> 1:58:16.791
Don't leave me here!
Don't do this to me!

1:58:18.835 --> 1:58:19.753
Mom!

1:58:23.089 --> 1:58:26.134
And you, you fucking wimp!
You too?

1:58:26.509 --> 1:58:28.970
You bitches are all against me!
All of you!

1:58:29.095 --> 1:58:30.513
I said back the fuck off!

1:58:32.307 --> 1:58:33.808
Is that fucking necessary!

1:58:33.933 --> 1:58:36.311
Let us do our job!

1:58:36.436 --> 1:58:38.647
- Drop that!
- You gonna fucking hurt me!

1:58:39.606 --> 1:58:40.940
Calm the fuck down, man!

1:58:41.066 --> 1:58:41.900
Calm down!

1:58:43.735 --> 1:58:44.653
Let me fucking go!

1:58:44.778 --> 1:58:45.779
Let him go!

1:58:47.280 --> 1:58:48.573
Son of a bitch!

1:58:51.201 --> 1:58:52.327
Let go of him!

1:58:53.328 --> 1:58:54.454
Son of a bitch!

1:58:54.579 --> 1:58:56.039
I'm just doing my job, ma'am!

1:58:56.164 --> 1:58:58.667
He hit my son!

1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:02.045
He hit him! He hit him!

1:59:02.170 --> 1:59:04.297
You signed the form!

1:59:04.422 --> 1:59:06.091
Let us do our job!
That's enough, ma'am!

1:59:06.216 --> 1:59:08.468
I didn't sign for you
to hit my son!

1:59:08.593 --> 1:59:10.178
Withdrawal clause ends
in 24 hours!

1:59:10.303 --> 1:59:11.805
Fuck your clause!

1:59:12.138 --> 1:59:15.141
- Come back in 24 hours, ma'am!
- Mom, he's hurting me!

1:59:15.475 --> 1:59:17.727
I'm his mother, I decide!

1:59:17.852 --> 1:59:18.812
Not anymore!

1:59:22.524 --> 1:59:25.318
What are they doing to him?
I changed my mind!

1:59:25.443 --> 1:59:27.028
Get out of the fucking way!

1:59:28.029 --> 1:59:36.029
Son of a bitch!

2:01:39.619 --> 2:01:41.663
There goes the forest...

2:01:42.831 --> 2:01:45.083
Forest again...

2:01:47.418 --> 2:01:49.462
And, now the beach, okay...

2:02:25.206 --> 2:02:27.792
<i>Hi, you've reached Diane's voice-mail.</i>

2:02:27.917 --> 2:02:28.918
<i>Leave a message</i>

2:02:29.794 --> 2:02:31.212
<i>and I'll call you back
as soon as possible.</i>

2:02:31.754 --> 2:02:33.172
<i>Thank you, bye, have a nice day.</i>

2:02:34.465 --> 2:02:36.092
Hey, it's me.

2:02:36.759 --> 2:02:39.512
I bet you must be
cleaning up your houses...

2:02:40.722 --> 2:02:42.932
I'm pretty bad-ass high...

2:02:44.309 --> 2:02:46.394
I was calling to say...

2:02:51.065 --> 2:02:53.234
Yo Die,
I'm so fucking ripped, serious...

2:02:54.903 --> 2:02:56.738
If you could see my face...

2:02:57.155 --> 2:02:59.532
You'd laugh your ass off!

2:03:02.076 --> 2:03:04.120
I thought you were gonna answer.

2:03:04.704 --> 2:03:06.205
I wanted to tell you...

2:03:10.501 --> 2:03:12.462
I just wanted to...

2:03:12.587 --> 2:03:14.964
thank you for your patience.

2:03:16.215 --> 2:03:19.177
I know I'm rough.

2:03:19.302 --> 2:03:21.471
Like Grandma used to say
when I was younger,

2:03:21.596 --> 2:03:22.722
that I was rough.

2:03:23.389 --> 2:03:25.767
Now I get it, why she said that.

2:03:26.976 --> 2:03:28.561
So... I'm sorry.

2:03:30.188 --> 2:03:31.397
And...

2:03:36.110 --> 2:03:37.153
And when...

2:03:38.112 --> 2:03:40.281
When I think about the times when...

2:03:42.742 --> 2:03:45.787
When I think about
how much maybe I hurt you...

2:03:47.538 --> 2:03:51.042
After, when I get my shit together...

2:03:53.920 --> 2:03:55.880
I'm so fucking sad because...

2:03:56.005 --> 2:03:58.758
you deserve so much better
than a fucking retard like me!

2:04:03.930 --> 2:04:04.973
So...

2:04:09.352 --> 2:04:13.731
What matters is... I'm thinking
about you here, and I love you.

2:04:17.902 --> 2:04:21.447
Tell Kyla I said hi.

2:04:29.163 --> 2:04:30.999
Was it okay?

2:04:35.378 --> 2:04:37.213
I mean, was it...

2:04:38.047 --> 2:04:39.799
I was okay? 'Ight.

2:04:46.556 --> 2:04:47.890
I rang.

2:04:48.641 --> 2:04:50.810
I didn't hear ya,
it must be broken.

2:04:54.397 --> 2:04:57.775
I'm cleaning up that shed,
it's a freakin' pigsty.

2:05:00.570 --> 2:05:01.946
Are you okay?

2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:03.865
Of course!

2:05:03.990 --> 2:05:06.451
You?
Long time no see, stranger!

2:05:07.493 --> 2:05:10.038
You wanna come in, have a beer?

2:05:10.163 --> 2:05:13.124
Watch some TV,
I finally plugged it in.

2:05:13.249 --> 2:05:14.709
It's just about time I did.

2:05:16.419 --> 2:05:17.378
Have a beer!

2:05:18.129 --> 2:05:21.591
We can have dinner too,
I'll fix some pasta...

2:05:22.592 --> 2:05:23.634
Come on!

2:05:24.802 --> 2:05:25.887
There!

2:05:28.056 --> 2:05:29.307
My good glasses...

2:05:43.613 --> 2:05:47.658
I came to tell you
we're moving to Toronto.

2:05:48.326 --> 2:05:49.744
For Patrick's job.

2:05:55.458 --> 2:05:57.001
Get outta here!

2:05:57.752 --> 2:06:00.379
Well, that ain't dull news, Toronto!

2:06:01.130 --> 2:06:02.381
Jeez, I only got beer!

2:06:03.049 --> 2:06:06.052
Had I known, I would have gotten
something more fancy! To party!

2:06:06.844 --> 2:06:08.596
I'll be damned!

2:06:09.430 --> 2:06:11.557
I lived in Toronto, once!

2:06:12.016 --> 2:06:13.810
Ages ago, though, but...

2:06:15.019 --> 2:06:17.438
Just before Steve, actually.

2:06:17.563 --> 2:06:21.609
I'd written down tons of addresses
and places and...

2:06:21.734 --> 2:06:25.947
in that huge, huge address book
I could give you...

2:06:26.739 --> 2:06:28.574
'Cause you can't tell right away,

2:06:29.742 --> 2:06:32.912
but Toronto can be an effin bore
if you dunno your way around.

2:06:33.579 --> 2:06:35.123
All of these places
I spotted, jeez...

2:06:35.456 --> 2:06:39.502
Restaurants, some good ones,
and cute shops, not tourist-traps.

2:06:40.378 --> 2:06:42.964
There's no way I threw that away!
Where the hell is it...

2:06:43.881 --> 2:06:45.424
When are you guys leaving?

2:06:45.967 --> 2:06:48.469
Well, two months from now,
originally,

2:06:50.304 --> 2:06:51.764
but then...

2:06:53.224 --> 2:06:57.270
they moved it
to two week-ends from now.

2:06:59.272 --> 2:07:00.815
But now...

2:07:00.940 --> 2:07:02.441
finally...

2:07:04.694 --> 2:07:07.446
we're leaving next weekend.

2:07:07.572 --> 2:07:09.198
Shit on a brick!

2:07:09.782 --> 2:07:11.033
Next weekend?!

2:07:11.659 --> 2:07:13.411
Wow!

2:07:17.498 --> 2:07:20.877
Talk about a big project!
Well, that's quite the adventure!

2:07:21.002 --> 2:07:23.963
You're moving to Toronto
next weekend!

2:07:25.339 --> 2:07:27.175
You must be over the effin moon!

2:07:33.347 --> 2:07:35.808
I didn't think you'd react that way.

2:07:39.145 --> 2:07:41.981
What the hell did ya expect!
It's such great news!

2:07:43.608 --> 2:07:46.527
It's awesome!
It's freaking awesome!

2:07:46.652 --> 2:07:47.778
You best write me, girl!

2:07:49.155 --> 2:07:52.200
If you don't, I'll visit you,
I swear I will, want it or not!

2:07:55.369 --> 2:07:57.663
I gotta go back to my boxes...

2:07:58.206 --> 2:08:00.458
Stay, grab a beer!

2:08:00.583 --> 2:08:02.585
Let's have dinner to celebrate!

2:08:02.710 --> 2:08:05.546
By the way,
bugs are eating up my apples,

2:08:05.671 --> 2:08:08.841
I gotta do something with them.
I could bake a pie.

2:08:08.966 --> 2:08:12.762
We'll have some pie. I got some
nice ice cream to put on top!

2:08:15.181 --> 2:08:17.600
I could come back later!

2:08:17.725 --> 2:08:20.061
Come with Patrick!

2:08:20.186 --> 2:08:21.145
And your daughter!

2:08:21.812 --> 2:08:22.730
They never came over!

2:08:37.453 --> 2:08:39.163
I don't want you to think

2:08:39.288 --> 2:08:42.333
these past few months
didn't mean anything to me,

2:08:43.251 --> 2:08:44.627
with you...

2:08:45.795 --> 2:08:47.004
Me too.

2:08:47.630 --> 2:08:49.966
They were important for me too!

2:08:50.091 --> 2:08:51.259
We had fun!

2:08:52.093 --> 2:08:54.637
A shitload of fun!

2:08:55.596 --> 2:08:58.307
You did us good, we loved having ya!

2:08:58.891 --> 2:09:00.101
In my life...

2:09:00.685 --> 2:09:02.603
You more of a pie girl
or crisp girl?

2:09:20.788 --> 2:09:22.915
I can't just abandon...

2:09:27.253 --> 2:09:28.504
...abandon my family...

2:09:41.851 --> 2:09:43.519
That's not what I meant.

2:10:00.494 --> 2:10:01.662
You know, Kyla...

2:10:05.082 --> 2:10:06.751
There's just so many ways to deal.

2:10:08.461 --> 2:10:11.130
You deal with your life,
I deal with mine. That's it.

2:10:18.095 --> 2:10:19.638
I sent him there...

2:10:23.726 --> 2:10:25.227
because I have hope.

2:10:27.188 --> 2:10:29.398
I'm full of hope, okay?

2:10:35.738 --> 2:10:37.865
This world ain't got tons of hope.

2:10:39.492 --> 2:10:41.035
But I like to think...

2:10:43.204 --> 2:10:46.832
that it's full of hopeful people,
hoping all day long.

2:10:50.336 --> 2:10:53.631
Better off that way 'cause us
hopeful people can change things.

2:10:54.632 --> 2:10:56.717
Hopeful world with hopeless people...

2:10:56.842 --> 2:10:59.095
That won't get us far.

2:11:01.430 --> 2:11:02.848
I did what I did...

2:11:07.561 --> 2:11:09.814
so that way, there is hope.

2:11:17.780 --> 2:11:18.989
So I win.

2:11:22.701 --> 2:11:23.953
All the way.

2:11:26.288 --> 2:11:29.625
It's a win-win.
For everybody.

2:11:34.171 --> 2:11:35.339
So...

2:11:36.215 --> 2:11:44.215
pie or crisp?

2:13:23.364 --> 2:13:26.575
Dr. Fawcett will pass by later,
for his meds' eval.

2:13:26.909 --> 2:13:28.827
Hopefully, we can relocate him--

2:13:28.953 --> 2:13:30.704
Nah, Micheline's off tonight.

2:13:31.372 --> 2:13:33.457
She left for St-Paul's
but she's back tonight.

2:13:33.582 --> 2:13:35.834
It's her Thursday.
- She's done with Thursdays.

2:13:36.252 --> 2:13:38.712
Not anymore.
Don't ask.

2:13:39.713 --> 2:13:41.215
Don't try to understand, bro.

2:13:42.633 --> 2:13:44.093
What can you do?

2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:45.886
She's happy with him.

2:13:46.679 --> 2:13:49.640
He started drinking again...
She's back with him, what can I say?

2:13:49.765 --> 2:13:51.892
Is she dumb,
she'll never understand?

2:13:52.017 --> 2:13:53.352
There's nothing to understand.

2:13:53.477 --> 2:13:55.229
She wants to save him.

2:13:55.854 --> 2:14:03.854
Fucking human nature, bro.
