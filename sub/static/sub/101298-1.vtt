00:01.469 --> 00:04.802
(soft futuristic music)

00:14.212 --> 00:16.244
(waves whooshing)
(birds chirping)

00:16.245 --> 00:19.578
(dark foreboding music)

03:09.241 --> 03:11.824
(gun blasting)

03:38.962 --> 03:40.627
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh yes, it is.

03:40.628 --> 03:41.461
- Aww, man.
- Ta-da.

03:41.462 --> 03:42.767
'Kay, so listen up.

03:42.768 --> 03:43.929
Listen up.

03:43.930 --> 03:47.329
When a stranger offers you
drugs, you say thank you.

03:47.330 --> 03:48.163
-  Yes.

03:48.163 --> 03:48.996
- You know why?
- You said it.

03:48.997 --> 03:51.212
- Because drugs are expensive.

03:51.213 --> 03:52.292
(man laughing)
- You said it.

03:52.293 --> 03:53.353
You said it.

03:57.070 --> 03:57.903
- Fuckin' whore.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.393
Can you maybe not do
this right fuckin' now?

04:04.190 --> 04:05.356
- I'm done, Toby.

04:05.357 --> 04:08.774
(soft foreboding music)

04:09.930 --> 04:11.529
- You're ridiculous.

04:11.530 --> 04:13.119
- I'm ridiculous?

04:13.120 --> 04:15.889
All this is completely ridiculous.

04:15.890 --> 04:18.059
You're just a bunch of coke heads.

04:18.060 --> 04:20.136
You're just standing around
flirting with these girls

04:20.137 --> 04:23.419
who are standing there like trophies.

04:23.420 --> 04:24.489
You're disgusting.

04:24.490 --> 04:25.529
- I'm disgusting.

04:25.530 --> 04:27.380
- Yeah, you've been high for two days

04:28.810 --> 04:31.228
and I saw you kissing that girl.

04:31.229 --> 04:36.229
(dark foreboding music)
(waves whooshing)

04:37.886 --> 04:41.809
You wanna know what your
friend Mark said to me?

04:41.810 --> 04:42.643
- Yeah, no.

04:42.643 --> 04:43.643
Not really but sure.

04:45.050 --> 04:46.050
Let's go.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.399
- He asked if I wanted to
go for a ride of a lifetime

04:50.400 --> 04:52.409
on his joystick.

04:52.410 --> 04:54.023
His joystick, Toby.

04:54.950 --> 04:57.169
- Are you really gonna fuckin'
do this again, right now?

04:57.170 --> 04:58.170
Yeah, I get it.

04:59.130 --> 05:01.229
You had a shitty childhood.

05:01.230 --> 05:02.230
Shitty.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.189
I had an awesome childhood.

05:05.190 --> 05:07.019
Awesome and I don't understand

05:07.020 --> 05:10.519
why I need to continuously
apologize for that to you

05:10.520 --> 05:13.006
and how you can just lay
blame on everybody else

05:13.007 --> 05:15.389
for your own insecurities, okay?

05:15.390 --> 05:17.090
That's just being a shitty person.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.633
It's fuckin' delusional, all right?

05:22.600 --> 05:25.669
Mark Anderson never hit on
you, I never kissed some girl.

05:25.670 --> 05:28.139
All I know is that it
doesn't matter where I am,

05:28.140 --> 05:30.659
what I'm doing or who I'm with.

05:30.660 --> 05:34.723
You end up being this
jealous fuckin' psycho.

05:37.970 --> 05:38.950
- Could you just lend me some money,

05:38.951 --> 05:40.759
so I have somewhere else to
stay for the rest of the week?

05:40.760 --> 05:41.949
I would appreciate that.

05:41.950 --> 05:45.319
- Seriously, that was your big plan?

05:45.320 --> 05:46.429
You're gonna take off on me

05:46.430 --> 05:48.059
and I'm gonna pay for your
hotel room somewhere else

05:48.060 --> 05:49.004
for the rest of the week?

05:49.004 --> 05:49.837
- I'll pay you back as soon as I get home.

05:49.838 --> 05:51.109
- How the fuck are you gonna do that?

05:51.110 --> 05:53.310
You can't even afford
your half of the rent.

05:55.630 --> 05:58.046
- Anything else you
wanna get off your chest?

05:58.047 --> 06:00.630
(Toby sighing)

06:03.029 --> 06:04.439
Can you just gimme enough money,

06:04.440 --> 06:06.369
so I can get a cab and I'll manage?

06:06.370 --> 06:07.370
- No.

06:09.210 --> 06:12.163
Hitchhike, fuckin' walk for all I care.

06:17.020 --> 06:20.903
Jade, I love you and
everything, but you're fucked.

06:22.402 --> 06:27.402
(dark foreboding music)
(waves whooshing)

07:10.916 --> 07:11.749
- Que paso?

07:11.750 --> 07:14.582
(water splashing)

07:16.100 --> 07:17.100
Is he breathing?

07:19.350 --> 07:20.700
- The hell happened to him?

07:22.122 --> 07:23.122
Jesus.

07:25.575 --> 07:28.908
(dark foreboding music)

07:40.480 --> 07:43.889
- So this guy thinks because
he's got his face plastered

07:43.890 --> 07:46.059
across 20 million teenagers' walls,

07:46.060 --> 07:48.109
he can screw us over and tell our clients

07:48.110 --> 07:50.919
to go fuck themselves 'cause
he's too tired and hungover

07:50.920 --> 07:52.129
to make it to his photo shoot.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.576
So I ring him up and I get
him on the phone and I say,

07:54.577 --> 07:55.410
"Listen, you little bitch.

07:55.411 --> 07:58.216
"I don't care if it's your
poor mother's funeral,

07:58.217 --> 08:00.217
"you're making it for your photo shoot."

08:01.260 --> 08:02.709
I shit you not.

08:02.710 --> 08:04.539
I get in the car and I rip across town

08:04.540 --> 08:06.909
and literally kick down the
door to his parent's place.

08:06.910 --> 08:08.834
- 'Cause of course the fucker
still lives with his parents.

08:08.835 --> 08:11.502
(both laughing)

08:14.230 --> 08:17.487
-  All right, who's up to bat first?

08:18.367 --> 08:21.131
-  I got good
download, so that's on you.

08:21.132 --> 08:22.299
That's on you.

08:23.232 --> 08:24.135
- That's on you.
- C'mon, big fella.

08:24.135 --> 08:24.968
Show 'em what you got.

08:24.969 --> 08:26.325
- Work it, girl.
- Show 'em what you got.

08:26.326 --> 08:27.428
- Work it.
- No mercy.

08:27.429 --> 08:29.735
- Work it.
- No mercy.

08:29.736 --> 08:30.569
(men chattering)

08:30.570 --> 08:34.778
(dark foreboding music)

08:34.779 --> 08:36.219
- Let's do it.

08:36.220 --> 08:37.491
(men shouting)

08:37.492 --> 08:40.075
(men clapping)

08:42.711 --> 08:44.269
(man laughing)

08:44.270 --> 08:45.496
-  C'mon buddy, swing it out.

08:45.497 --> 08:47.541
- All right, check the
wind and make it count.

08:47.542 --> 08:48.624
Here we go.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.379
Here we go, here we go.

08:50.380 --> 08:52.462
- I want a fucking chocolate.

08:52.463 --> 08:54.278
C'mon, c'mon.

08:54.279 --> 08:56.194
Bring it here.

08:56.195 --> 08:58.778
(men shouting)

09:02.483 --> 09:06.566
- Ooh, look at this.
- Look at this, look at this.

09:08.510 --> 09:11.843
(dark foreboding music)

09:15.245 --> 09:18.078
(waves whooshing)

10:07.480 --> 10:09.040
-  You're outta your fuckin' mind.

10:09.439 --> 10:10.629
- Dude.

10:10.630 --> 10:11.679
- It's 200 miles away.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.219
On these roads, he's gonna bleed to death

10:13.220 --> 10:14.659
before we get to the hospital.

10:14.660 --> 10:17.089
We are not taking him there on our own.

10:17.090 --> 10:19.723
It's a fucked up, stupid idea.

10:22.880 --> 10:23.880
- All right, bro.

10:35.407 --> 10:37.923
(birds chirping)

10:37.924 --> 10:40.769
(Mike grunting)

10:40.770 --> 10:42.905
- Hey, what's with the fuckin' attitude?

10:42.906 --> 10:44.219
- The whatitude?

10:44.220 --> 10:45.053
- Oh my god.

10:45.054 --> 10:46.599
- What is the problem?

10:46.600 --> 10:47.600
- You've been in bitchy mode

10:47.601 --> 10:49.909
since the second we left this morning.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.749
It's not my fault you don't
know how to change the tire.

10:51.750 --> 10:52.800
- I changed the tire.

10:54.640 --> 10:55.839
Okay, yeah if by bitchy mode

10:55.840 --> 10:57.629
you mean doin' everything you say

10:57.630 --> 10:59.579
and changing all of my plans
to suit you, then yeah.

10:59.580 --> 11:01.130
Sure, I've been in bitchy mode.

11:02.130 --> 11:03.729
I've been in bitchy mode
for like five months.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.609
- Okay see, that is exactly
what I'm talking about.

11:06.610 --> 11:08.249
You don't get to come here for free

11:08.250 --> 11:09.979
on a trip to tropical paradise

11:09.980 --> 11:11.342
and then whine about
Darcy and his partners

11:11.343 --> 11:12.599
like a spoiled little brat.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.169
- When did I whine about
Darcy and his partners?

11:14.170 --> 11:15.003
- When?
- When?

11:15.003 --> 11:15.836
- Right here.

11:15.837 --> 11:17.909
The text message to Brandon.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.536
- Don't go into my...
- "You're right, Brandon.

11:19.537 --> 11:21.016
"I really should be more grateful

11:21.017 --> 11:23.486
"for this amazing opportunity I get

11:23.487 --> 11:24.856
"to spend the week with my girlfriend

11:24.857 --> 11:26.916
"and a bunch of Hugh Hefner wannabees

11:26.917 --> 11:28.816
"who spend their time
funding plastic surgery

11:28.817 --> 11:31.344
"and buying drinks for
skinny-looking bunnies."

11:31.345 --> 11:32.303
- Don't go in my phone.

11:32.303 --> 11:33.197
You shouldn't go in my phone.

11:33.198 --> 11:36.219
(birds chirping)
(soft foreboding music)

11:36.220 --> 11:38.349
- Skinny-looking bunnies, really?

11:38.350 --> 11:40.699
- It's just lock-worth property.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.692
- You do realize that you clean
windows for a living, right?

11:43.693 --> 11:46.499
- I do not clean windows for a living.

11:46.500 --> 11:50.413
I own 50% of a window
cleaning business, okay?

11:51.442 --> 11:52.779
And unlike the Magnificent Six over there,

11:52.780 --> 11:54.089
I did not get it handed to me.

11:54.090 --> 11:56.049
I worked my ass off for this,

11:56.050 --> 11:58.279
unlike you who has
nothing working under you

11:58.280 --> 11:59.260
except for that big ass

11:59.261 --> 12:01.210
you're always showin' off on Instagram.

12:03.802 --> 12:04.849
It's not a big...

12:04.850 --> 12:05.850
You got a great ass.

12:07.510 --> 12:08.510
Goddammit.

12:11.297 --> 12:12.929
(Tanya sighing)

12:12.930 --> 12:16.189
(dark foreboding music)
(trunk slamming)

12:16.190 --> 12:17.990
- It's called the A-sail-o Syndrome.

12:20.090 --> 12:22.623
Sooner you come to terms
with it, the better.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.669
I understand you don't want to admit

12:26.670 --> 12:28.420
you're just like your mother and I.

12:31.710 --> 12:32.710
You're right, Jade.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.640
You're not.

12:38.690 --> 12:41.669
You're much worse than
the both of us combined.

12:41.670 --> 12:43.509
If jealousy was a superpower,

12:43.510 --> 12:46.060
there'd be a whole comic
book collection about you.

12:49.800 --> 12:53.879
You can't mask the pain by dropping acid

12:53.880 --> 12:55.163
and make it all better.

12:56.154 --> 12:58.904
(wind whooshing)

13:02.542 --> 13:05.393
I could hear you begging from a mile away.

13:07.030 --> 13:08.046
- Stop it.

13:08.047 --> 13:09.047
- "Daddy.

13:10.987 --> 13:12.777
"Daddy, what should I do?"

13:16.465 --> 13:18.477
Like the feint squeal of a rat.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.453
That same annoying fucking noise you make

13:23.454 --> 13:27.007
every time you feel betrayed.

13:27.008 --> 13:29.758
(wind whooshing)

13:39.763 --> 13:41.829
(birds chirping)

13:41.830 --> 13:43.809
-  So how's
things goin' with Jade?

13:43.810 --> 13:46.093
-  Yeah, we're not good.

13:49.639 --> 13:50.999
- Man, you brought sand to the beach.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.809
When are you gonna learn your lesson?

13:52.810 --> 13:54.239
- You're seriously gonna give me

13:54.240 --> 13:55.940
relationship advice right now?

13:55.941 --> 13:56.979
- Uh-huh.

13:56.980 --> 13:57.980
All boils down to

13:59.360 --> 14:00.619
four words:

14:00.620 --> 14:02.349
Be more like me.

14:02.350 --> 14:03.779
- 'Kay, there are many
things that I aspire to

14:03.780 --> 14:05.829
and none of them are becoming a manwhore.

14:05.830 --> 14:08.489
-  You say that
like it's a bad thing.

14:08.490 --> 14:09.589
- I do respect you.

14:09.590 --> 14:11.853
I mean you're rich, you're successful.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.999
You're always doing shit like this.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.039
I mean you seem to sleep with
a different woman every night.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.263
No one talks down to you
or tells you what to do.

14:21.204 --> 14:22.799
- Is that really what you
think my life is like?

14:22.800 --> 14:23.800
-  Yeah.

14:24.496 --> 14:25.719
(birds chirping)
(soft foreboding music)

14:25.720 --> 14:27.409
- 'Cause it isn't.

14:27.410 --> 14:29.569
I mean yeah, I get laid a lot.

14:29.570 --> 14:31.459
I do have a lotta toys and cars

14:31.460 --> 14:36.460
and helicopters and jets
and threesomes and orgies.

14:39.010 --> 14:41.069
I forget where I was goin'.

14:41.070 --> 14:43.068
Oh yes, yes.

14:43.069 --> 14:45.229
(chuckles) My life is
way better than yours.

14:45.230 --> 14:46.753
-  Jade thinks we need help.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.220
- What,

14:50.920 --> 14:52.613
in quoting a paranoid...
- Hey.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.010
- Ex-girlfriend who's
supposed to make me feel bad?

14:57.010 --> 14:58.709
-  She's seeing a shrink, all right?

14:58.710 --> 14:59.543
She's tryin' to get help

14:59.544 --> 15:02.064
and it's not like I'm gonna
wait around for her to do that.

15:02.065 --> 15:02.974
-  Yeah, (speaks faintly).

15:02.975 --> 15:04.469
- But it got me thinkin' that you know,

15:04.470 --> 15:06.799
maybe you and I should do the same.

15:06.800 --> 15:07.849
- It's a waste of time.

15:07.850 --> 15:11.979
I mean do you really
think that blaming dad

15:11.980 --> 15:14.099
or talkin' to some fuckin'
doll version of him

15:14.100 --> 15:15.600
is gonna make anything better?

15:16.700 --> 15:17.700
Forget about it.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.630
It's just not the hand we were dealt.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.729
Look, I won't be all
like big brother on you,

15:26.730 --> 15:28.630
but the bottom line is

15:29.830 --> 15:31.169
we are male whores.

15:31.170 --> 15:32.170
Deal with it.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.849
- Wes, you dropped this.

15:35.850 --> 15:36.850
Is that you?

15:38.110 --> 15:39.110
Wes.

15:40.390 --> 15:41.939
Dude.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.689
Feel like this fell
right of you, isn't it?

15:43.690 --> 15:44.993
- Yeah, here, here.

15:50.739 --> 15:55.739
(wind whooshing)
(birds chirping)

15:57.651 --> 16:00.318
(eerie howling)

16:02.910 --> 16:04.559
So you're sayin' that
you actually told her

16:04.560 --> 16:07.303
that she could hitchhike
or walk to the airport.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.397
- I'm not givin' that woman another dime.

16:12.664 --> 16:14.231
- That's spectacular.

16:14.232 --> 16:19.232
(birds chirping)
(eerie howling)

16:33.520 --> 16:35.770
- Hey, are you seein' this?

16:38.230 --> 16:39.469
-  See what?

16:39.470 --> 16:40.993
- Like that up there.

16:42.140 --> 16:43.239
-  What?

16:43.240 --> 16:44.397
What am I lookin' at?

16:46.590 --> 16:47.423
- I don't know, man.

16:47.424 --> 16:48.893
I must be trippin'.

16:50.660 --> 16:53.359
- I think what you did is
you looked in your pants

16:53.360 --> 16:55.193
and you realize you have an elf dick.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.233
- Elf dick?
- Elf dick.

17:00.918 --> 17:02.109
- All right.

17:02.110 --> 17:05.109
This is what you got
goin' on in your head,

17:05.110 --> 17:06.932
swimmin' around in there?

17:06.933 --> 17:11.933
(Wesley groaning)
(birds chirping)

17:21.930 --> 17:23.452
- Mike, I just don't think you understand

17:23.453 --> 17:25.409
how hard I worked for this.

17:25.410 --> 17:26.927
- I do.

17:26.928 --> 17:29.229
I do understand and I know
how important it is to you

17:29.230 --> 17:31.253
and I will try and enjoy it.

17:32.590 --> 17:36.112
But next year, next
year we're goin' skiing.

17:36.113 --> 17:38.173
- (chuckles) Yeah, we're not going skiing.

17:39.840 --> 17:40.673
- Why do you hate skiing?

17:40.673 --> 17:41.640
- We went through this, okay?

17:41.641 --> 17:44.249
I don't like snow and I don't
think any of my followers

17:44.250 --> 17:46.843
wanna see me wearing a ski
suit, so not happening.

17:49.810 --> 17:51.429
- Don't you just love
planning your vacation

17:51.430 --> 17:53.979
based on your girlfriend's
Instagram followers, Mike?"

17:53.980 --> 17:55.419
I do.

17:55.420 --> 17:57.979
I do 'cause there's nothing
more important to me

17:57.980 --> 18:00.579
than a bunch of fat losers who
think my girlfriend's sexy.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.789
- Okay, you know what?

18:01.790 --> 18:04.349
If this is your idea of
humor, then you can go ahead

18:04.350 --> 18:06.299
and get a ticket home right the fuck now.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.793
Because out here, nobody is laughing.

18:11.683 --> 18:14.089
(birds chirping)

18:14.090 --> 18:15.390
'Kay, where are you going?

18:17.350 --> 18:18.950
- I forgot something in the car.

18:20.870 --> 18:22.059
- Okay, well hurry up.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.162
I'll be inside.

18:23.163 --> 18:24.330
-  Sure.

18:41.333 --> 18:44.333
(animal screeching)

18:51.626 --> 18:54.376
(wind whooshing)

19:31.734 --> 19:33.466
- It's gonna be okay.

19:33.467 --> 19:35.793
- That what you told
yourself nine years ago?

19:39.130 --> 19:40.130
- Fine.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.414
It's the drugs kickin' in.

19:44.330 --> 19:47.963
- You're not fine and it has
nothing to do with the drugs.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.500
- I'm fine.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.398
Just gonna relax.

19:55.399 --> 19:57.242
It's gonna pass.

19:57.243 --> 19:59.110
- Yeah, right.

19:59.111 --> 20:01.861
(wind whooshing)

20:05.979 --> 20:08.896
(gravel crunching)

20:11.325 --> 20:14.658
(dark foreboding music)

20:17.762 --> 20:20.679
(eerie scratching)

20:30.595 --> 20:34.012
(eerie foreboding music)

20:38.244 --> 20:40.994
(wind whooshing)

21:05.974 --> 21:07.057
- I hate you.

21:10.355 --> 21:11.355
- I know.

21:13.221 --> 21:15.888
(siren wailing)

21:36.314 --> 21:38.897
(birds cooing)

21:42.935 --> 21:45.685
(doors slamming)

21:48.719 --> 21:51.386
(siren wailing)

22:06.078 --> 22:08.519
(dark foreboding music)

22:08.520 --> 22:09.530
- It's not real.

22:13.483 --> 22:14.650
It's not real.

22:18.235 --> 22:19.535
It's not real.

22:19.536 --> 22:22.203
(siren wailing)

22:27.701 --> 22:29.868
- It's fucking real, Jade.

22:33.577 --> 22:34.872
It's fucking real, Jade!

22:34.873 --> 22:36.623
It's so fucking real!

22:37.814 --> 22:40.814
(paramedic wincing)

23:04.866 --> 23:07.533
(eerie howling)

23:31.467 --> 23:36.467
(birds chirping)
(flesh squishing)

23:38.052 --> 23:43.052
(axe chopping)
(leaves rustling)

23:56.226 --> 23:59.059
(waves whooshing)

24:03.357 --> 24:08.357
(men chattering)
(eerie foreboding music)

24:14.812 --> 24:15.724
-  Work it.

24:15.725 --> 24:20.657
Work it, girl. (shouts)

24:22.706 --> 24:26.039
(dark foreboding music)

24:37.848 --> 24:40.515
(man shrieking)

24:56.543 --> 25:00.030
(motorcycle engines roaring)

25:00.031 --> 25:04.281
(man speaking in foreign language)

25:15.106 --> 25:18.470
(woman speaking in foreign language)

25:18.471 --> 25:20.048
(man speaking in foreign language)

25:20.049 --> 25:24.466
(woman speaking in foreign language)

25:25.668 --> 25:28.666
(man speaking in foreign language)

25:28.667 --> 25:33.107
(woman speaking in foreign language)

25:33.108 --> 25:37.358
(man speaking in foreign language)

25:39.617 --> 25:43.237
(eerie foreboding music)

25:43.238 --> 25:45.017
(man speaking in foreign language)

25:45.018 --> 25:45.851
- Gorgeous.

25:45.851 --> 25:46.840
Look at your long, flowing hair.

25:46.841 --> 25:49.346
I love it, the natural
wind passing through it.

25:49.347 --> 25:50.180
Beautiful.

25:50.180 --> 25:51.013
I love it, I love it.

25:51.013 --> 25:51.846
Yeah, keep it smiling.

25:51.846 --> 25:52.679
Keep it up, keep it up.

25:52.680 --> 25:56.093
Yup, smiling, laughing. (chuckles)

25:56.094 --> 25:57.409
Ooh papi, you're so stupid.

25:57.410 --> 25:58.350
You know, all that stuff.

25:58.350 --> 25:59.307
Yeah, yeah, I love it.

25:59.307 --> 26:00.300
That's good.

26:00.301 --> 26:01.489
Hey Darc, how do you say

26:01.490 --> 26:03.040
I think I'm in love in Spanish?

26:04.077 --> 26:06.407
(Darcy speaking in foreign language)

26:06.408 --> 26:08.257
(Harrison speaking in foreign language)

26:08.258 --> 26:10.617
(women chuckling)

26:10.618 --> 26:12.809
- You just called yourself a pig.

26:12.810 --> 26:14.969
-  That'll make a
woman raise an eyebrow, Harry.

26:14.970 --> 26:15.970
- Yeah, I guess so.

26:17.285 --> 26:20.612
(Darcy grunting)

26:20.613 --> 26:21.613
You fuck.

26:23.830 --> 26:25.430
- You gentlemen hear the latest?

26:27.370 --> 26:28.439
My little brother Toby here

26:28.440 --> 26:31.199
just literally told his
girlfriend to take a hike.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.509
I mean literally, as in hitchhike

26:32.510 --> 26:34.373
and walk to the fucking airport.

26:35.738 --> 26:38.239
He fuckin' threw her out because
she wouldn't stop bitchin'.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.459
You know, my mom, she used to joke

26:40.460 --> 26:43.049
and call him a little retard
'cause she had him in the 50s.

26:43.050 --> 26:44.059
Well I'll tell you somethin'.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.760
Yeah, he may be a little bit slow;

26:46.800 --> 26:47.710
but much like us,

26:47.711 --> 26:50.052
he'll never let anybody put a
fuckin' leash around his neck.

26:50.053 --> 26:51.083
- Good for you.

26:52.180 --> 26:54.209
But seriously, your brother
says good things about you.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.929
The company could use some fresh blood.

26:56.930 --> 26:58.749
How'd you like to sub in for Harrison?

26:58.750 --> 27:00.701
We're thinkin' of gettin' rid of him.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.399
- Yeah, you might wanna wipe
that smirk off your face, pal.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.689
Fisticuffs, huh?

27:04.690 --> 27:05.989
-  Yeah, let's go, bro.

27:05.990 --> 27:09.346
I like it.

27:09.347 --> 27:12.097
(wind whooshing)

27:13.400 --> 27:14.400
- You're pathetic.

27:15.310 --> 27:17.933
He's treating you like
trash and cheating on you.

27:18.790 --> 27:19.793
Everyone knows it.

27:20.770 --> 27:22.143
- It's just a stupid kiss.

27:23.820 --> 27:26.539
Barely counts as cheating, I don't care.

27:26.540 --> 27:28.509
-  Oh, but you do care.

27:28.510 --> 27:30.357
That's all you think about.

27:31.533 --> 27:32.623
It's in your DNA.

27:33.660 --> 27:35.279
And in every single one

27:35.280 --> 27:37.133
of our family's psychiatrist reports,

27:38.661 --> 27:40.533
what did the good doctor call it?

27:41.867 --> 27:45.619
Oh yeah, morbidly distrustful.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.530
-  You're just projecting

27:46.531 --> 27:49.149
your own self-blame and fears onto me.

27:49.150 --> 27:50.150
I don't care.

27:53.220 --> 27:56.560
- Whatever helps you get
out of bed in the morning.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.181
(waves whooshing)

28:18.328 --> 28:23.328
(glass shattering)
(Toby shouting)

28:23.879 --> 28:27.212
(dark foreboding music)

29:32.760 --> 29:35.559
- Hey, have you seen Toby?

29:35.560 --> 29:37.653
- Toby, Toby, Toby, Toby, Toby.

29:39.770 --> 29:40.870
Yeah, he's a cool guy.

29:41.930 --> 29:43.399
Not cool enough to lend you a few bucks

29:43.400 --> 29:44.500
to get to the airport.

29:46.119 --> 29:47.519
- Why don't you stick around?

29:47.520 --> 29:50.319
You're much better off
out here with us anyway.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.753
- You know, I'm gonna
actually prefer to walk.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.339
Get hit by a car while I'm at it.

29:58.340 --> 30:00.403
But thank you so much for the offer.

30:02.876 --> 30:07.269
- (laughs maniacally) Okay muchachos,

30:07.270 --> 30:09.719
who wants to go to town
and hit up the bars, huh?

30:09.720 --> 30:10.899
- I think the girls and I

30:10.900 --> 30:13.121
are gonna stick around
a little while longer.

30:13.122 --> 30:14.637
- Ooh, you lucky guapas.

30:16.870 --> 30:18.523
Darcy, Harrison, vamonos.

30:19.960 --> 30:21.033
- Yeah, let's do it.

30:24.122 --> 30:26.217
(man vocalizing)

30:26.218 --> 30:30.593
(woman speaking in foreign language)

30:30.594 --> 30:34.844
(man speaking in foreign language)

30:38.902 --> 30:43.319
(woman speaking in foreign language)

30:47.803 --> 30:52.053
(man speaking in foreign language)

30:58.813 --> 31:03.230
(woman speaking in foreign language)

31:04.411 --> 31:06.029
(birds chirping)

31:06.030 --> 31:08.329
- To be honest, they're
sayin' it really feels

31:08.330 --> 31:10.999
like you're goin' Vin Diesel
on us right about now.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.129
- No, bro.

31:12.130 --> 31:15.249
Look, this is basic courtesy, right?

31:15.250 --> 31:18.302
I mean who brought them
back in the first place?

31:18.303 --> 31:19.136
Me.

31:19.136 --> 31:19.969
- No, come on.

31:19.969 --> 31:20.802
You're sayin' there should be ground rules

31:20.802 --> 31:21.635
of finders keepers?

31:21.636 --> 31:22.894
- Yes, that's exactly
what I'm talkin' about.

31:22.895 --> 31:25.069
- Cute. (chuckles)

31:25.070 --> 31:26.499
-  Anyway in that case,

31:26.500 --> 31:28.705
I got the petite one, okay?

31:28.706 --> 31:32.039
(dark foreboding music)

31:34.770 --> 31:36.079
-  Are we really
gonna fuckin' do this again

31:36.080 --> 31:37.080
right now?

31:38.060 --> 31:39.899
-  If jealousy was a superpower,

31:39.900 --> 31:42.450
there'd be a whole comic
book collection about you.

31:44.166 --> 31:45.846
-  That's just
being a shitty person.

31:47.610 --> 31:49.553
It's fuckin' delusional.

31:49.554 --> 31:50.510
-  Yeah, he's a cool guy.

31:50.511 --> 31:51.979
Not cool enough to lend you a few bucks

31:51.980 --> 31:53.080
to get to the airport.

31:58.410 --> 32:01.659
-  You end up acting like
this jealous fucking psycho.

32:01.660 --> 32:04.603
Look, I love you and
everything, but you're fucked.

32:09.807 --> 32:12.640
(woman shrieking)

32:23.266 --> 32:26.099
(waves whooshing)

32:30.535 --> 32:32.854
(leaves rustling)

32:32.855 --> 32:35.605
(birds chirping)

32:41.760 --> 32:44.429
- Seriously guys, what
does Wes have that I don't?

32:44.430 --> 32:45.449
- 'Bout a foot and a half this way

32:45.450 --> 32:47.974
and about 80 pounds of muscle, bruh.

32:47.975 --> 32:49.286
-  Yeah, well keep talkin' like this,

32:49.287 --> 32:51.937
I'm gonna shove a foot and
a half up both your asses.

32:52.979 --> 32:54.547
Yeah, that's right.

32:54.548 --> 32:59.548
(both chuckling)
(dark foreboding music)

33:07.950 --> 33:08.810
- Hi.

33:08.810 --> 33:09.810
-  Hey.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.023
- Wait, I know you.

33:12.023 --> 33:13.023
We met before.

33:14.036 --> 33:15.469
You're Toby Hunter's girl, right?

33:15.470 --> 33:16.470
- Was.

33:17.168 --> 33:19.213
You're Tanya's boyfriend.

33:20.370 --> 33:22.133
- Yeah, I don't know.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.285
Maybe breakups are contagious around here.

33:26.286 --> 33:28.319
(branches snapping)

33:28.320 --> 33:29.320
Where are you goin'?

33:30.810 --> 33:32.260
- Hitchhiking to the airport.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.739
-  You're what, seriously?

33:35.740 --> 33:36.740
-  Yeah.

33:38.590 --> 33:40.539
- You know that's like 400 miles away.

33:40.540 --> 33:41.540
-  Yup.

33:42.550 --> 33:44.369
-  The ferry
doesn't leave 'til 8 a.m.

33:44.370 --> 33:45.370
-  Yup.

33:48.180 --> 33:49.233
-  Wait a minute.

33:51.970 --> 33:52.970
Hey, wait up.

33:54.950 --> 33:55.910
Hey, wait, wait.

33:55.911 --> 33:57.269
I'll come with you.

33:57.270 --> 33:58.103
We'll go in the morning.

33:58.104 --> 33:59.136
We'll get the ferry,

33:59.137 --> 34:00.777
but let's go back to the mansion for now.

34:01.261 --> 34:03.406
- That's very lovely of
you, but no thank you.

34:03.407 --> 34:04.479
- C'mon.
- I appreciate you

34:04.480 --> 34:06.029
tryin' to help and everything,

34:06.030 --> 34:07.269
but you are so much better off

34:07.270 --> 34:10.409
just tryin' to patch things up with Tanya

34:10.410 --> 34:13.729
than spending it with me, so enjoy.

34:13.730 --> 34:15.133
- Why, what's wrong with you?

34:16.230 --> 34:18.480
Are you into roadkill
taxidermy or something?

34:21.820 --> 34:24.853
Do you eat your own
skin, chew your toenails?

34:26.040 --> 34:27.040
That's okay.

34:29.732 --> 34:30.774
(Jade sighing)

34:30.775 --> 34:33.092
(dark foreboding music)

34:33.093 --> 34:33.970
-  Guys, I'm Jane Goodall right here.

34:33.971 --> 34:35.963
- This is the coolest thing.

34:37.253 --> 34:39.609
-  Look at how
he catches it, no problem.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.039
He looks like Jerry Rice.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.187
- Oh god, fuck.

34:42.188 --> 34:43.050
(monkey screeching)

34:43.051 --> 34:44.400
- Oh my god, this is great.

34:46.380 --> 34:47.380
- Hey.

34:52.233 --> 34:53.679
(eerie foreboding music)
(sap trickling)

34:53.680 --> 34:55.209
Goddamn, look how close we are.

34:55.210 --> 34:57.939
- I actually just launch
it right into him.

34:57.940 --> 34:58.940
You want it?

35:01.400 --> 35:02.902
- Little fuck, oh shit.

35:02.903 --> 35:04.039
- Hey, you're good.

35:04.040 --> 35:04.970
You gotta relax.

35:04.971 --> 35:06.343
This is the best.

35:06.344 --> 35:10.123
- It's so good.
- This is the coolest thing.

35:10.124 --> 35:14.124
-  We're surrounded
by monkeys right now.

35:19.807 --> 35:24.807
(radio chattering)
(birds chirping)

35:38.661 --> 35:42.078
(eerie foreboding music)

35:56.510 --> 35:58.146
- You guys look amazing.

35:58.147 --> 35:59.069
- What're you doin'?

35:59.070 --> 36:00.330
- What do you mean?

36:00.331 --> 36:01.364
I'm filming.

36:01.365 --> 36:03.659
What you guys, you camera shy or what?

36:03.660 --> 36:04.919
As Roosevelt once said...

36:04.920 --> 36:07.929
- Oh no, fuck off with
your fucking quotes.

36:07.930 --> 36:08.840
- Don't throw anything.

36:08.841 --> 36:10.599
Dude, just hear me out for one second.

36:10.600 --> 36:11.849
All right, guys?

36:11.850 --> 36:13.666
As Franklin Roosevelt once said,

36:13.667 --> 36:16.016
"There's a better life and a better world

36:16.017 --> 36:18.699
"beyond the horizon."

36:18.700 --> 36:21.669
Now three of us, we've known
this for a very long time now

36:21.670 --> 36:26.379
and to this day, we never
cease to expand our horizons.

36:26.380 --> 36:30.719
And I'm proud of us and I'm
immortalizing the moment,

36:30.720 --> 36:32.174
so shut up.

36:32.175 --> 36:34.242
- All right, you bring up a good point.

36:34.243 --> 36:35.659
I am proud of you.

36:35.660 --> 36:36.660
I'm proud of us.

36:37.940 --> 36:40.509
But we gotta do somethin'
about Harry's shirt.

36:40.510 --> 36:41.343
- Yeah.

36:41.344 --> 36:43.149
Oh good, I thought I was the only one.

36:43.150 --> 36:46.119
- No, this reflects poorly on us.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.739
- Wow, you guys just been saving this up

36:47.740 --> 36:48.573
the whole time, huh?

36:48.574 --> 36:49.939
-  Dude, turn it
inside out or something.

36:49.940 --> 36:52.007
- I think you need a few
more holes in that thing.

36:52.008 --> 36:53.284
(Darcy laughing)

36:53.285 --> 36:55.849
- Bro, the chicks dig the holes, man.

36:55.850 --> 36:57.309
It makes it look like I got shot.

36:57.310 --> 36:58.753
-  Ooh, you're a hero.

36:58.754 --> 37:01.459
(Toby laughing)

37:01.460 --> 37:02.759
- You guys are funny, man.

37:02.760 --> 37:03.750
- Peter Pan's in.
- Yeah, yeah.

37:03.751 --> 37:04.959
- He'd look so hot right now.

37:04.960 --> 37:05.840
- Bring it back.

37:05.841 --> 37:07.029
-  Come down off
this rock and say that to me.

37:07.030 --> 37:08.469
-  Yeah, no I'm comin'.

37:08.470 --> 37:09.720
Always with the fighting.

37:10.690 --> 37:11.720
- The fuck was that?

37:14.090 --> 37:17.590
(soft intriguiging music)

37:40.261 --> 37:41.428
- Guys, c'mon.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.015
Let's go.

37:44.016 --> 37:45.015
Enough games, all right?

37:45.016 --> 37:48.348
(soft intriguing music)

37:58.440 --> 37:59.483
Guys, come on!

38:08.039 --> 38:09.829
-  All I know is that
it doesn't matter where I am,

38:09.830 --> 38:12.489
what I'm doing or who I'm with.

38:12.490 --> 38:17.319
You end up being this
jealous fuckin' psycho.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.219
-  If jealousy was a superpower,

38:19.220 --> 38:22.563
there'd be a whole comic
book collection about you.

38:22.564 --> 38:24.069
-  Mommy?

38:24.070 --> 38:25.759
-  Yeah, I get it.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.849
You had a shitty childhood.

38:27.850 --> 38:30.066
Now that you call yourself a young adult.

38:30.067 --> 38:31.184
-  Mommy.

38:31.185 --> 38:32.018
-  And I don't understand

38:32.019 --> 38:35.099
why I need to continuously
apologize for that to you

38:35.100 --> 38:37.631
and how you can just lay
blame on everybody else

38:37.632 --> 38:39.929
for your own insecurities, okay?

38:39.930 --> 38:42.027
That's just being a shitty person.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.172
-  I love you, mommy.

38:43.173 --> 38:46.506
(soft foreboding music)

38:47.670 --> 38:49.170
I love you, mommy.

38:50.220 --> 38:52.919
(gun blasting)

38:52.920 --> 38:54.483
-  It's fuckin' delusional.

38:54.484 --> 38:57.234
-  I love you, daddy.

38:58.918 --> 39:01.177
(young Jade speaking faintly)

39:01.178 --> 39:03.928
(birds chirping)

39:07.113 --> 39:10.705
-  Hitchhike, fuckin'
walk for all I care.

39:10.706 --> 39:13.269
(young Jade muttering)

39:13.270 --> 39:15.009
- Hey guys, that's far enough!

39:15.010 --> 39:16.010
Let's go!

39:18.260 --> 39:20.643
We're wasting valuable time here, guys.

39:21.569 --> 39:24.319
(birds chirping)

39:33.601 --> 39:37.018
(eerie foreboding music)

39:40.930 --> 39:43.459
-  Jade, I love you.

39:43.460 --> 39:44.460
I do,

39:45.960 --> 39:46.960
but you're fucked.

39:52.778 --> 39:55.155
(gun cocking)

39:55.156 --> 39:57.845
(gun blasting)

39:57.846 --> 40:01.179
(dark foreboding music)

40:03.684 --> 40:07.569
- Look at this, guys.
- Guys, I think I'm in love.

40:07.570 --> 40:09.939
- Bruh, it's like the
third time in three hours.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.329
- Well we still got all night.

40:11.330 --> 40:13.099
- Yeah and I'm recruitin' mode, fellas.

40:13.100 --> 40:14.222
No rest for the wicked, all right?

40:14.223 --> 40:15.313
Just take some notes.

40:16.919 --> 40:19.669
(wind whooshing)

40:54.670 --> 40:56.620
-  You're a fucking cunt, Jade.

40:57.660 --> 40:58.760
Just like your mother.

41:00.380 --> 41:01.996
I despised you when you were 12

41:01.997 --> 41:06.049
and now the mere sight of
your ugly freckled face

41:06.050 --> 41:07.163
makes me wanna puke.

41:08.105 --> 41:10.855
(wind whooshing)

41:21.765 --> 41:24.515
(birds chirping)

41:25.390 --> 41:26.531
- Hi.

41:26.532 --> 41:28.319
-  Hey.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.320
- Wait, I know you.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.153
We met before.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.759
You're Toby Hunter's girl, right?

41:32.760 --> 41:33.949
I guess my deep flirt secret

41:33.950 --> 41:36.246
is my life is not that interesting.

41:36.247 --> 41:40.103
I like to work, I like to travel a lot.

41:40.968 --> 41:41.968
- Where do you work?

41:43.250 --> 41:45.169
- I'm part owner of a
window washing business.

41:45.170 --> 41:49.039
I bought it from the
old man we worked for,

41:49.040 --> 41:50.619
me and my partner.

41:50.620 --> 41:51.919
His sons didn't want it,

41:51.920 --> 41:54.020
so he made us an offer we couldn't refuse.

41:56.090 --> 41:57.090
- That's awesome.

41:58.590 --> 41:59.590
- Yeah?

42:01.140 --> 42:02.189
Thank you.

42:02.190 --> 42:03.949
- Yeah, you're own boss.

42:03.950 --> 42:06.329
That's what we all want.
- Exactly.

42:06.330 --> 42:07.633
Tanya thinks I'm so lame.

42:09.510 --> 42:12.632
- Tanya works for people who tell her

42:12.633 --> 42:15.769
how much to eat and what to wear.

42:15.770 --> 42:17.259
I don't think she has much room to talk.

42:17.260 --> 42:19.760
-  So you're not a
fan of models, I take it.

42:20.617 --> 42:22.371
-  They're not in my top 10.

42:22.372 --> 42:25.122
(birds chirping)

42:34.397 --> 42:35.397
- Mike?

42:47.570 --> 42:50.023
-  So go on, what
are you so fucked up about?

42:53.270 --> 42:54.270
You can tell me.

43:02.310 --> 43:07.033
-  I think I killed my
father and now he haunts me.

43:12.520 --> 43:13.520
-  Really?

43:15.690 --> 43:16.690
- Yup.
- Why?

43:17.377 --> 43:18.377
I'm sorry.

43:20.570 --> 43:21.430
- It was a long time ago.

43:21.431 --> 43:23.023
I don't really remember.

43:24.812 --> 43:26.236
I was just a kid.

43:26.237 --> 43:28.163
-  That's a lot.

43:28.164 --> 43:31.664
-  (chuckles) Yeah.

43:33.140 --> 43:34.633
- Do you wanna know what I think?

43:36.140 --> 43:37.140
- Sure.

43:38.780 --> 43:41.733
- I think you need to find
a way to forgive yourself.

43:43.246 --> 43:44.539
You were just a little
kid when it happened,

43:44.540 --> 43:47.180
so it's not your fault.

43:49.837 --> 43:52.287
- You sure you're in the
window washing business?

43:54.179 --> 43:55.179
- Yeah.

43:57.048 --> 43:58.129
But I also think that you can learn

43:58.130 --> 43:59.380
something from everybody,

44:01.317 --> 44:04.993
everybody who passes through your life,

44:06.300 --> 44:07.743
even a lowly window washer.

44:10.852 --> 44:12.304
- That's a load of crap.

44:12.305 --> 44:13.305
- Yeah?

44:14.268 --> 44:15.101
Yeah, maybe.

44:15.102 --> 44:16.675
It's a good line though, right?

44:16.676 --> 44:18.689
- (chuckles) It's a great line.

44:18.690 --> 44:19.979
Nailed it.

44:19.980 --> 44:22.730
(birds chirping)

44:23.930 --> 44:25.209
- Guys, I'm Jane Goodall right here.

44:25.210 --> 44:27.193
-  This is the coolest thing.

44:29.470 --> 44:31.265
- Peter Pan's in.
- Yeah, yeah.

44:31.266 --> 44:32.629
- It's so hot right now.
- Bring it back.

44:32.630 --> 44:34.009
-  Come down off
this rock and say that to me.

44:34.010 --> 44:34.997
-  Yeah, no I'm comin'.

44:34.998 --> 44:37.749
(birds chirping)
(soft foreboding music)

44:37.750 --> 44:39.000
-  Guys, c'mon.

44:40.080 --> 44:41.539
Let's go.

44:41.540 --> 44:42.740
Enough games, all right?

44:47.680 --> 44:49.209
Hey guys, that's far enough!

44:49.210 --> 44:50.210
Let's go!

44:54.632 --> 44:55.632
- Harrison!

44:57.049 --> 44:58.049
Harrison.

45:00.650 --> 45:01.650
Harry!

45:19.034 --> 45:24.034
(gun blasting)
(dark intriguing music)

45:28.305 --> 45:31.606
(wind whooshing)

45:31.607 --> 45:33.333
-  See, that was the wrong choice.

45:50.531 --> 45:53.281
(birds chirping)

46:33.072 --> 46:36.655
(intense foreboding music)

47:04.390 --> 47:06.429
-  It's over, Jade.

47:06.430 --> 47:08.080
But that's exactly what you want.

47:09.721 --> 47:14.721
You want to die. (chuckles)

47:15.722 --> 47:18.472
(birds chirping)

47:26.160 --> 47:27.879
-  Let's call the cops.

47:27.880 --> 47:28.713
- Really?

47:28.714 --> 47:30.439
Again, we're not callin' the cops.

47:30.440 --> 47:31.619
- I don't see another option.

47:31.620 --> 47:32.859
- Really?

47:32.860 --> 47:34.399
You don't see another fucking option.

47:34.400 --> 47:36.219
Darcy, how do you think
this is gonna play out?

47:36.220 --> 47:37.210
The cops are gonna show up,

47:37.211 --> 47:39.059
they're gonna find half a
million dollars worth of candy.

47:39.060 --> 47:40.669
What, we're all then just gonna high five?

47:40.670 --> 47:41.503
You know, snort a few lines

47:41.504 --> 47:43.029
and then they're gonna help us Harrison?

47:43.030 --> 47:43.863
- What's your suggestion:

47:43.864 --> 47:46.029
We stop lookin' and hope
Harrison shows up in the morning?

47:46.030 --> 47:47.030
- Yes.

47:48.143 --> 47:48.976
Fuck.

47:48.976 --> 47:49.809
- You know, I really wanna be there

47:49.810 --> 47:51.963
when Carmen dry fucks
your ass with a cactus.

47:55.631 --> 47:58.209
(both breathing heavily)

47:58.210 --> 48:03.210
(dark foreboding music)
(waves whooshing)

48:21.782 --> 48:25.307
- Shit!
- (shrieks) Go.

48:25.308 --> 48:28.141
(leaves rustling)

48:37.610 --> 48:41.027
(eerie foreboding music)

48:59.540 --> 49:02.957
(both breathing heavily)

49:04.782 --> 49:05.865
- Okay, okay.

49:41.554 --> 49:44.387
(eerie shrieking)

50:32.011 --> 50:37.011
(man wincing)
(dark foreboding music)

51:02.226 --> 51:04.893
(man shrieking)

51:15.138 --> 51:17.721
(axe chopping)

51:19.342 --> 51:22.675
(soft intriguing music)

51:35.422 --> 51:36.422
- Help!

51:37.801 --> 51:39.519
Help. (winces)

51:39.520 --> 51:44.520
Mike. (breathes heavily)

51:45.603 --> 51:47.873
- Dude, what is goin' on here?

51:49.414 --> 51:50.581
What the fuck?

51:52.961 --> 51:56.294
(dark foreboding music)

52:33.022 --> 52:34.022
What the?

52:35.030 --> 52:38.363
(dark foreboding music)

52:47.246 --> 52:48.246
Fuck!

53:04.324 --> 53:08.709
(birds chirping)
(eerie foreboding music)

53:08.710 --> 53:11.543
(waves whooshing)

53:45.611 --> 53:47.561
(grunts) You gentlemen hear the latest?

53:49.340 --> 53:50.409
My little brother Toby here

53:50.410 --> 53:53.159
just literally told his
girlfriend to take a hike.

53:53.160 --> 53:54.239
I mean literally,

53:54.240 --> 53:57.439
as in hitchhike and walk
to the fucking airport.

53:57.440 --> 54:00.239
He fuckin' threw her out because
she wouldn't stop bitching.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.449
You know, my mom, she used to joke

54:02.450 --> 54:05.019
and call him a little retard
'cause she had him in the 50s.

54:05.020 --> 54:06.029
Well I'll tell ya somethin':

54:06.030 --> 54:07.730
Yeah, he may be a little bit slow.

54:08.780 --> 54:09.740
But much like us,

54:09.741 --> 54:12.293
he'll never let anybody put a
fuckin' leash around his neck.

54:15.203 --> 54:18.620
(eerie foreboding music)

54:20.750 --> 54:22.773
-  Hey, have you seen Toby?

54:24.940 --> 54:27.223
- Toby, Toby, Toby, Toby, Toby.

54:29.160 --> 54:30.260
Yeah, he's a cool guy.

54:31.290 --> 54:32.759
Not cool enough to lend you a few bucks

54:32.760 --> 54:33.860
to get to the airport.

54:35.406 --> 54:36.899
Why don't you stick around?

54:36.900 --> 54:39.679
You're much better off
out here with us anyway.

54:39.680 --> 54:43.153
-  You know, I'm gonna
have to prefer to walk.

54:45.783 --> 54:47.709
Get hit by a car while I'm at it.

54:47.710 --> 54:49.763
But thank you so much for the offer.

54:51.688 --> 54:56.629
-  (laughs
hysterically) Okay muchachos,

54:56.630 --> 54:59.069
who wants to go to town
and hit up the bars, huh?

54:59.070 --> 55:00.759
-  I think the girls
are gonna stick around

55:00.760 --> 55:01.860
a little while longer.

55:03.301 --> 55:04.801
-  Ooh, you lucky guapas.

55:06.319 --> 55:11.319
(dark foreboding music)
(waves whooshing)

55:22.799 --> 55:27.799
(Howard chuckling maniacally)
(birds chirping)

55:50.645 --> 55:54.062
(Jade breathing heavily)

55:58.079 --> 56:00.286
- (shrieks) Go.

56:00.287 --> 56:02.897
(intense foreboding music)

56:02.898 --> 56:03.898
Stop!

56:07.523 --> 56:08.356
No.

56:08.357 --> 56:12.548
No, no. (shrieks)
(fist pounding)

56:12.549 --> 56:13.549
No!

56:17.256 --> 56:20.589
(dark intriguing music)

56:25.873 --> 56:29.290
(both breathing heavily)

56:31.628 --> 56:34.378
- (winces) Help.

56:57.607 --> 56:59.857
- C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
- Go.

57:05.261 --> 57:06.261
- C'mon.

58:00.258 --> 58:02.758
(man wincing)

58:52.613 --> 58:54.113
-  Let's go.

59:00.725 --> 59:04.308
(ambulance engine roaring)

59:22.577 --> 59:25.577
(ambulance bashing)

59:26.802 --> 59:27.635
-  Goddammit.

59:27.635 --> 59:28.468
Goddammit.

59:28.468 --> 59:29.301
- Why'd you stop?

59:29.302 --> 59:30.675
Don't, Mike, Mike, Mike.

59:30.676 --> 59:31.676
Stop!

59:34.017 --> 59:37.363
(gun blasting)

59:37.364 --> 59:40.697
(dark foreboding music)

59:42.302 --> 59:43.594
Mike?

59:43.595 --> 59:44.718
Mike.

59:44.719 --> 59:45.552
Mike!

59:45.553 --> 59:48.885
(dark foreboding music)

59:54.547 --> 59:55.547
Stop.

1:00:06.830 --> 1:00:09.413
(dogs barking)

1:00:10.485 --> 1:00:13.902
(Jade breathing heavily)

1:00:19.899 --> 1:00:22.649
(birds chirping)

1:00:50.256 --> 1:00:52.923
(Jade coughing)

1:00:54.790 --> 1:00:57.623
(chains rattling)

1:01:13.513 --> 1:01:16.013
(dog barking)

1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:20.240
- Let's talk.

1:01:21.020 --> 1:01:22.089
- Let's not, Howard.

1:01:22.090 --> 1:01:23.090
Please.

1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:28.633
- You're gonna call me dad, not Howard.

1:01:29.550 --> 1:01:30.583
And yes, now.

1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:34.225
You'll do whatever I tell
you to do until you die.

1:01:34.226 --> 1:01:36.853
- (breathes heavily) Is
that really what you want?

1:01:39.020 --> 1:01:40.020
- Yeah.

1:01:41.450 --> 1:01:44.549
- I'm your daughter, doesn't
that mean anything to you?

1:01:44.550 --> 1:01:46.560
- It did, but not anymore.

1:01:47.870 --> 1:01:49.459
I'm done crying.

1:01:49.460 --> 1:01:52.629
Now all I want is for
you to know how it feels.

1:01:52.630 --> 1:01:55.783
(pipes clanking)

1:01:55.784 --> 1:01:58.617
(chains rattling)

1:02:00.030 --> 1:02:01.580
They're fucking with you, Jade.

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:07.627
They wanna traumatize you.

1:02:09.420 --> 1:02:12.805
Bottom line: We all want you dead.

1:02:12.806 --> 1:02:15.723
(eerie screeching)

1:02:22.876 --> 1:02:25.626
(eerie clinking)

1:02:56.183 --> 1:02:59.386
(Jade breathing heavily)

1:02:59.387 --> 1:03:01.213
You never apologized.

1:03:02.680 --> 1:03:03.793
You could've saved me.

1:03:04.780 --> 1:03:05.780
- I was 12.

1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:09.380
- You knew exactly what she was up to.

1:03:11.936 --> 1:03:13.154
- No, I didn't.

1:03:13.155 --> 1:03:15.625
And even if I did, what could I have done?

1:03:15.626 --> 1:03:18.743
(eerie scratching)
(Jade gasping)

1:03:18.744 --> 1:03:19.744
- Run, Jade.

1:03:22.053 --> 1:03:24.803
(motor rumbling)

1:03:30.210 --> 1:03:35.210
(birds chirping)
(ambulance engine roaring)

1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:39.948
(man breathing heavily)

1:03:39.949 --> 1:03:42.449
(man wincing)

1:03:45.363 --> 1:03:48.280
(gravel crunching)

1:03:56.303 --> 1:03:58.803
(man wincing)

1:04:21.901 --> 1:04:24.734
(chains rattling)

1:04:52.618 --> 1:04:55.079
(twig snapping)

1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:57.747
(twig clanking)

1:05:00.666 --> 1:05:03.583
(eerie screeching)

1:05:04.887 --> 1:05:07.637
(eerie clinking)

1:05:17.237 --> 1:05:22.237
(birds chirping)
(Zumas cooing)

1:05:42.620 --> 1:05:47.620
Second she closed that door,
you should've said something.

1:05:59.379 --> 1:06:00.379
"Mommy?

1:06:02.167 --> 1:06:06.386
"Mommy, why'd you close the garage door?

1:06:06.387 --> 1:06:07.916
"The engine's still running.

1:06:07.917 --> 1:06:09.477
"Daddy's gonna die."

1:06:18.992 --> 1:06:19.992
Truth is

1:06:22.290 --> 1:06:24.423
I always knew she did it intentionally.

1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:29.203
You couldn't do anything
because you were too weak.

1:06:31.510 --> 1:06:32.510
And guess what?

1:06:34.557 --> 1:06:35.724
You still are.

1:06:40.160 --> 1:06:42.642
You're gonna die, Jade.

1:06:42.643 --> 1:06:43.726
Just like me.

1:06:44.934 --> 1:06:46.460
Finally.

1:06:46.461 --> 1:06:49.044
(loud banging)

1:06:53.089 --> 1:06:56.422
(dark intriguing music)

1:07:25.550 --> 1:07:30.550
(door squeaking)
(birds chirping)

1:07:30.781 --> 1:07:34.198
(Zuma breathing heavily)

1:07:38.803 --> 1:07:42.136
(dark foreboding music)

1:08:10.307 --> 1:08:12.746
(Jade shrieking)
(knife stabbing)

1:08:12.747 --> 1:08:17.747
(eerie screeching)
(birds chirping)

1:08:21.444 --> 1:08:26.444
(Jade shrieking)
(foot bashing)

1:08:26.750 --> 1:08:30.083
(dark foreboding music)

1:08:36.715 --> 1:08:41.715
(gun blasting)
(Jade wincing)

1:08:57.224 --> 1:09:02.224
(gun blasting)
(Jade coughing)

1:09:16.450 --> 1:09:19.783
(dark intriguing music)

1:09:29.214 --> 1:09:31.714
(man wincing)

1:09:35.539 --> 1:09:38.289
(birds chirping)

1:09:49.297 --> 1:09:52.630
(soft intriguing music)

1:10:53.596 --> 1:10:56.179
(gun blasting)

1:11:10.069 --> 1:11:11.069
I hate you.

1:11:12.020 --> 1:11:13.053
You're pathetic.

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:16.579
It's in your DNA.

1:11:16.580 --> 1:11:18.296
I despised you when you were 12.

1:11:18.297 --> 1:11:22.219
And now the mere sight of
your ugly freckled face

1:11:22.220 --> 1:11:23.333
makes me wanna puke.

1:11:25.271 --> 1:11:28.604
(dark foreboding music)

1:11:30.350 --> 1:11:31.569
-  A friend of mine once asked me

1:11:31.570 --> 1:11:33.923
for relationship advice.

1:11:37.347 --> 1:11:39.247
"What's the best way to find closure?"

1:11:40.590 --> 1:11:43.090
Now there are three types
of people I really hate:

1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:48.869
liars, cheaters and relationship experts

1:11:48.870 --> 1:11:52.457
who start every sentence
with, "Here's my advice."

1:11:53.420 --> 1:11:55.349
But now that I'm safe,

1:11:55.350 --> 1:11:57.039
I feel like I've earned my seat

1:11:57.040 --> 1:11:59.783
on the here's-my-advice-about-life.

1:12:01.180 --> 1:12:03.219
I actually only have two things to say

1:12:03.220 --> 1:12:05.369
and both I've learnt from someone

1:12:05.370 --> 1:12:07.020
who could've been a great friend.

1:12:08.370 --> 1:12:11.519
One: I really think we can learn something

1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:15.439
from absolutely everyone
that crosses our path,

1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:16.440
no exception.

1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:22.940
And two: Sometimes you
simply have no choice.

1:12:23.630 --> 1:12:26.079
You have to do whatever it takes

1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:29.159
to get that annoying
boyfriend or that ghost

1:12:29.160 --> 1:12:33.823
that's been forever haunting
you to shut the fuck up.

1:12:34.890 --> 1:12:38.223
(dark intriguing music)

1:13:30.478 --> 1:13:33.811
(soft foreboding music)
