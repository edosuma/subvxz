oh!

02:45.331 --> 02:48.100
wait, there's a bar!

02:48.168 --> 02:49.868
i'm with you!

02:56.009 --> 02:56.975
dude.

02:59.512 --> 03:03.415
you got bruce leroy,
you got jeff from jersey shore.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.516
hey, jeff?

03:04.584 --> 03:06.518
Taking shots, right?

03:06.586 --> 03:08.520
what kind of question is that?

03:08.588 --> 03:10.722
He's a little younger than a lot of
the people in the house, as is bruce.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.458
those are the two biggest
characters out right now.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.394
if you choke me, bro,
i'm going to sleep.

03:15.461 --> 03:16.595
i'm not tapping.

03:16.663 --> 03:18.363
you choke me, i'm going to sleep.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.532
well, what if the guy has
an arm bar? would you tap?

03:20.600 --> 03:24.036
no. it makes it easier,
once it's broke, to pull out.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.972
jeff definitely doesn't exude

03:27.040 --> 03:29.441
the professional mixed
martial artist attitude.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.415
i don't think smoking
and drinking every night

03:36.482 --> 03:37.983
is gonna really help
you in the long run

03:38.051 --> 03:39.851
for this type of sport, so...

03:39.919 --> 03:42.254
i drank 8 ounces of miller lite.

03:42.322 --> 03:43.589
i just did a few shots.

03:43.656 --> 03:45.324
i did like four, five,
six, seven shots,

03:45.391 --> 03:46.825
something like that.

03:46.893 --> 03:50.329
they see me smoking a cigarette,
doing whatever,

03:50.396 --> 03:52.497
let them think i got
no gas in the tank.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.233
You know, i got cardio for days.

03:57.003 --> 03:58.604
that's just

03:58.671 --> 04:00.105
i'm glad you brought that

04:00.173 --> 04:02.507
that's the bomb right there.

04:04.477 --> 04:06.778
bruce leroy is a character, man.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.680
he's got stories and
stories and stories,

04:08.748 --> 04:10.315
and none of them make any sense.

04:10.383 --> 04:12.384
- i killed an alligator.
- really?

04:12.452 --> 04:14.453
with my bare goddamn hands.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.055
the crazy stories,
the goofy smile on his face...

04:17.123 --> 04:18.757
i feel bad for the poor kid's mom.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.791
i wrestled a deer, but he got away.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.361
i was gonna snap its neck.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.329
How the did you
catch the deer, man?

04:24.397 --> 04:26.431
how'd you get the deer?
deers are super fast.

04:26.499 --> 04:30.402
you're getting in way
over your afro, dude.

04:30.470 --> 04:33.038
"the deer whupped my ass.
Alligators, you're first."

04:42.849 --> 04:45.217
trying to train and
get picked over teams.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.619
we're gonna get back
into the gym, man,

04:47.687 --> 04:48.920
and i think st. pierre and koscheck

04:48.988 --> 04:50.956
are gonna choose the
fighters for their teams.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.726
no idea, man.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.197
hopefully, koscheck picks me,

04:59.265 --> 05:01.700
and i think it'll benefit me
the most to be on his team.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.302
it'll definitely
benefit him the most.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.809
i'd rather be on gsp's team...
all-around fighter.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.611
i think he'll be better
for me in the long run.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.549
my picks are in.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.217
i got it.

05:19.285 --> 05:22.287
The process of us kind of,
you know, ranking the guys...

05:22.355 --> 05:23.822
we rank them 1 to 14.

05:23.890 --> 05:27.426
And you know, we had, obviously,
michael johnson number one.

05:27.493 --> 05:30.262
i think he's probably
<i>the</i> best athlete

05:30.330 --> 05:32.531
that we have here on the show.

05:32.598 --> 05:35.067
you know, we had marc
stevens number 2.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.569
that wrestler kid is gonna
be a freakin' character, too.

05:37.637 --> 05:38.937
you know?

05:39.005 --> 05:40.872
he's cocky.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.308
he's cocky. i like that.

05:43.376 --> 05:46.211
we had, uh,
psycho and sevak 3 and 4.

05:46.279 --> 05:49.247
so, you know,
we had a nice little rank.

05:49.315 --> 05:50.782
what did they do the last time?

05:50.850 --> 05:54.753
they let you pick first pick
or first fight, i believe.

05:54.821 --> 05:58.023
And i would go for person rather
than fight, in my opinion.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.524
that's the way we
did it with rashad.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.693
we were able to win the
fights and get control anyway.

06:01.761 --> 06:04.096
st. pierre: you know what?
I think if we get the first pick,

06:04.163 --> 06:05.864
it's gonna waste one choice.

06:05.932 --> 06:08.867
he's gonna take stevens
on this side right away.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.235
man #2: are you sure?

06:10.303 --> 06:11.503
i think they are buddies.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.205
i know koscheck probably knew

06:13.272 --> 06:15.741
that i knew that marc
stevens was his friend,

06:15.808 --> 06:18.176
so he knew that i was
not going to pick him.

06:18.244 --> 06:19.711
give me a piece of paper.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.947
i write down their name first,

06:22.014 --> 06:25.851
so when i'm next, i'll fake
it so koscheck can see.

06:25.918 --> 06:28.620
he's gonna think they're
my first choice.

06:28.688 --> 06:29.855
let's do this.

06:29.922 --> 06:31.690
he's gonna pick them before i do.

06:31.758 --> 06:34.926
So, what i did is i put
him in big character

06:34.994 --> 06:36.962
in my fake list number one.

06:37.029 --> 06:40.866
so, by doing so, he would
have lose one of his chances.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.434
you think he's gonna bite?

06:42.502 --> 06:44.569
We don't know,
but it's worth a shot.

06:44.637 --> 06:45.904
we'll see if he's smart.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.376
so, as we go into the team picks,

06:51.444 --> 06:53.845
i notice that georges st. pierre

06:53.913 --> 06:57.382
is holding his team
picks in his hand,

06:57.450 --> 06:58.884
and it's facing me and koscheck.

06:58.951 --> 07:03.288
you got all your
hanging out there, bro.

07:05.958 --> 07:09.294
on the top of gsp's list,
it says "stevens."

07:10.563 --> 07:13.432
so i see koscheck's list,

07:13.499 --> 07:15.500
and koscheck's list says
"michael johnson."

07:15.568 --> 07:18.503
and we're here first.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.372
one, two, three, you know?

07:20.440 --> 07:23.141
"stevens, phan, dane."

07:23.209 --> 07:25.177
stevens used to
wrestle for koscheck.

07:25.244 --> 07:27.179
so i guess koscheck's
thinking of this

07:27.246 --> 07:28.647
as kind of one of his guys.

07:28.714 --> 07:31.550
If i go first,
should i just go for it?

07:31.617 --> 07:33.385
'cause i think i can get them both.

07:36.556 --> 07:37.856
huge.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.061
okay?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.996
of course. they were

07:57.310 --> 07:58.844
good morning, guys,
and welcome to the team picks.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.278
i have this coin.

08:00.346 --> 08:03.148
yellow is koscheck...

08:03.216 --> 08:04.716
red is gsp.

08:07.854 --> 08:09.354
all right.

08:09.422 --> 08:10.989
josh koscheck wins the flip.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.557
team koscheck,
you either have the chance

08:12.625 --> 08:15.594
to pick the first fighter
or pick the first fight.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.128
the team that wins the fight

08:17.196 --> 08:20.832
keeps control and gets to
keep picking the fights.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.801
hmm.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.172
that just changed some things.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.573
Do we take the pick?

08:28.641 --> 08:30.542
take the pick. We'll take the pick.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.110
want to pick the
first fighter? Yes.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.979
okay.

08:34.046 --> 08:35.746
so you get to pick the first fight.

08:35.815 --> 08:37.249
all right? Okay.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.618
go ahead. pick your first fighter.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.630
we'll take, uh, marc stevens.

09:01.173 --> 09:03.542
all right, gsp,
who's your first pick?

09:03.609 --> 09:05.076
i pick michael johnson.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.817
so, he made koscheck
go after stevens first

09:12.885 --> 09:14.619
so he could get michael johnson.

09:14.687 --> 09:17.055
exactly.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.126
well played georges st.
pierre. well played.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.262
all right, josh?

09:24.330 --> 09:25.997
i'm gonna take sevak.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.802
i pick jonathan brookins.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.073
psycho.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.044
Want to pick spencer paige.

09:41.180 --> 09:41.980
andrew main.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.484
next pick is bruce leroy.

09:46.552 --> 09:47.819
alex.

09:51.123 --> 09:52.490
all right, koscheck.

09:52.558 --> 09:53.258
nam phan.

09:55.127 --> 09:56.661
i pick kyle watson.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.130
aaron wilkinson.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.901
i pick cody mckenzie.

10:05.404 --> 10:06.605
jeff lentz.

10:10.977 --> 10:13.078
i finally made it to this show.

10:13.145 --> 10:15.046
i'm so proud i made it to the show.

10:15.114 --> 10:18.350
but then it just kind of bites
me that i'm the last guy picked.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.151
i pick dane sayers.

10:20.219 --> 10:22.654
man, i'm gonna have to
prove these guys wrong...

10:22.722 --> 10:23.822
everybody here...

10:23.889 --> 10:25.457
I'm not some, like, chump.

10:25.524 --> 10:28.326
congratulations.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.695
one of the things i like
about this season already

10:30.763 --> 10:32.364
is i liked what i saw yesterday.

10:32.431 --> 10:35.867
and i'm really happy with
not only both coaches

10:35.935 --> 10:37.535
but the staff that they've
brought with them.

10:37.603 --> 10:41.406
you have literally the <i>best</i>
coaches possible.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.574
all right?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.242
welcome to "the ultimate fighter."

10:47.580 --> 10:48.747
being picked last doesn't mean

10:48.814 --> 10:49.714
remember that.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.391
st. pierre: you know what
would be my first speech?

10:59.458 --> 11:02.427
i'll do the sergeant hartman speech in
"full metal jacket."

11:02.495 --> 11:05.964
"when you ladies leave my office,

11:06.032 --> 11:08.566
"if you survive recruit training,

11:08.634 --> 11:12.103
"you will be a minister of war,
praying for war...

11:12.171 --> 11:14.739
"a minister of death
praying for war.

11:14.807 --> 11:17.342
"but until then, you're just puke.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.910
you're not even human beings."

11:26.552 --> 11:27.986
for me, i'm a coach.

11:28.054 --> 11:29.754
you know, i'm the
coach of the season,

11:29.822 --> 11:32.857
but i think i would be a
better use for this guy

11:32.925 --> 11:35.026
as a training partner than a coach.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.632
i let my coach coach my team.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.835
and i'm more like a training
partner with these guys.

11:57.416 --> 12:00.151
i will bring many
different coaches.

12:00.219 --> 12:04.022
greg jackson is a strategist...
the maestro.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.157
he's the guy that
makes the music play.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.197
make sure you keep your
mental acuity about you.

12:12.264 --> 12:13.865
right now, i have john danaher.

12:13.933 --> 12:18.136
and he's the smartest guy that
i've met in my entire life.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.004
he's like a... like a dictionary,

12:20.072 --> 12:22.841
like an encyclopedia of knowledge,

12:22.908 --> 12:24.242
not only of jujitsu.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.944
there's more than just victory.

12:26.011 --> 12:30.915
there's also an ideal
for a beautiful victory.

12:30.983 --> 12:32.584
that's what georges
always tries to espouse

12:32.651 --> 12:33.752
in his fighting philosophy.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.153
that's what a martial art is.

12:35.221 --> 12:37.055
that's when the "artist"
comes into play.

12:37.123 --> 12:38.656
we want to transform you in that.

12:38.724 --> 12:42.927
the main difference in me and
josh koscheck for this season,

12:42.995 --> 12:45.530
i choose my theme in
different criteria

12:45.598 --> 12:47.632
than most of the guys in the past.

12:50.035 --> 12:52.003
i did not choose a single fighter

12:52.071 --> 12:54.873
because he was the strongest

12:54.940 --> 12:56.841
or he had the best
pedigree on paper.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.576
I choose guys who are very good,

12:58.644 --> 13:01.446
but guys that i know,
by watching them,

13:01.514 --> 13:03.148
that i can help.

13:03.215 --> 13:04.649
when you will leave
the training here,

13:04.717 --> 13:06.651
at the end of this season,

13:06.719 --> 13:09.521
you will be a much better
fighter than when you start.

13:09.588 --> 13:11.790
that's something that
i can promise you.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.091
i promise you.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.860
this show, for me,
is not about winning.

13:15.928 --> 13:17.929
This show is not about me.

13:17.997 --> 13:18.963
i'm not selfish.

13:19.031 --> 13:20.732
this show, it's about the guys.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.067
it's their show.
it's their time to shine.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.343
team gsp.

13:32.411 --> 13:33.745
let's keep it red.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.313
yeah, let's keep it red.

13:40.386 --> 13:43.154
i think i have the edge
versus georges st. pierre,

13:43.222 --> 13:44.589
because i've been here.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.758
you know, i spent a long
time here on season one.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.560
it's been over six years,
and i'm back.

13:56.936 --> 13:59.604
i believe in mindless training.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.472
oh, yeah. yes.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.042
there you go. single,
single, single. single.

14:04.109 --> 14:05.443
go to the single.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.178
mindless training is, guess what,

14:07.246 --> 14:08.813
you guys just show up and train.

14:08.881 --> 14:10.248
i'll tell you what to do.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.884
and if you listen to me,
you'll achieve your goals.

14:12.952 --> 14:15.453
He peels it right off, okay?

14:15.521 --> 14:16.988
now look.

14:17.056 --> 14:20.592
i think that my coaching staff
is definitely world-class.

14:20.659 --> 14:21.926
we're gonna be doing
a lot of wrestling.

14:21.994 --> 14:22.861
'cause wrestling wins fights.

14:25.464 --> 14:28.132
bob cook is my head guy.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.568
what happens when his
head's over my head?

14:30.636 --> 14:32.270
i'm getting up.

14:32.338 --> 14:36.307
jujitsu, stand-up, striking...
he can pretty much do it all.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.543
The other way! come on!

14:38.611 --> 14:40.044
hyah! hyah!

14:40.112 --> 14:43.948
i brought teddy lucio.
he is my personal boxing coach.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.783
and i brought daniel cormier,

14:45.851 --> 14:48.419
who is a 2-time olympian wrestler.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.456
okay, fellas, let's push yourself.

14:51.523 --> 14:52.457
this is our cardio.

14:52.524 --> 14:54.025
go!

14:54.093 --> 14:57.095
i'm gonna have to be the guy
that carries the show...

14:57.162 --> 14:59.063
Me and my coaching staff...

14:59.131 --> 15:03.234
because, obviously,
the public already has me labeled.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.970
Nobody's expecting
from you from the u.k.

15:06.038 --> 15:08.640
you know, the heel of the ufc.

15:08.707 --> 15:11.075
You got something to prove
because i didn't pick you first.

15:11.143 --> 15:12.477
that should piss you off.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.245
that should motivate you. come on!

15:14.313 --> 15:19.417
but you just know,
labeling me is absurd.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.552
we're gonna get you
boys right today.

15:21.620 --> 15:22.854
huh!

15:22.922 --> 15:24.889
if you come and meet
me person-to-person,

15:24.957 --> 15:26.557
and we sit down and
have a conversation

15:26.625 --> 15:27.825
or you hang out with me,

15:27.893 --> 15:29.594
you'll fall in love with me,
guaranteed.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.467
no way i want to lose
to georges st. pierre.

15:36.535 --> 15:38.236
no way.

15:38.304 --> 15:40.238
i plan on beating georges st.
Pierre in this competition.

15:40.306 --> 15:42.440
no way those guys are
training this hard.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.542
that's my goal.
that's my coaches' goal.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.110
and that's all these fighters

15:46.178 --> 15:48.646
that i'm coaching and
training every single day,

15:48.714 --> 15:50.748
is for one reason...
one reason only...

15:50.816 --> 15:52.583
and that's to beat, that's to win.

15:52.651 --> 15:55.453
we got an opportunity...
opportunity to win.

15:55.521 --> 15:58.589
that's our slogan for
this whole camp, is "win."

15:58.657 --> 16:00.325
nothing other than that. 1, 2, 3...

16:00.392 --> 16:01.292
win!

16:15.174 --> 16:19.610
we are in control of the first
pick for the first fight.

16:19.678 --> 16:24.682
and from my team, i chose alex...

16:33.292 --> 16:35.426
...fighting jeffrey.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.167
alex wanted to have this fight.

16:43.235 --> 16:47.238
i want him to be happy,
so i'll give it to him.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.842
it was definitely my decision.

16:52.378 --> 16:53.911
i'm the freshest one ready to go,

16:53.979 --> 16:56.514
and i think it's gonna be
a good fight with jeff,

16:56.582 --> 16:58.549
because he likes to
keep it standing up,

16:58.617 --> 17:00.118
and that's where my world is,

17:00.185 --> 17:02.186
so think that was the
best choice for me.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.324
listen. i'd want the
fighters' input.

17:06.392 --> 17:09.359
You know, if i was gsp, i'd say,
"yeah, i want you guys' input,"

17:09.428 --> 17:11.561
but i would be the ultimate
decision-maker. you know?

17:11.630 --> 17:14.365
you know, i'm a control
freak, i guess.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.334
maybe that's just me,
and gsp isn't,

17:16.402 --> 17:19.670
but, you know, it's a
pretty interesting approach,

17:19.738 --> 17:23.340
to let the fighters pick
their own opponents.

17:25.411 --> 17:28.012
yeah, i think this matchup
is perfect for us.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.380
lentz has got good stand-up,

17:29.448 --> 17:31.249
and he's got crazy
ground and pound.

17:31.316 --> 17:33.017
So i think this is gonna
be a great matchup

17:33.085 --> 17:33.985
for us to gain control.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.622
it's gonna be a great matchup.

17:37.689 --> 17:38.890
you control your own destiny now.

17:38.957 --> 17:39.857
yes, sir.

18:00.145 --> 18:01.746
it all started for me

18:01.814 --> 18:03.981
when my father showed me
the first bruce lee movie,

18:04.049 --> 18:05.450
which was "enter the dragon."

18:05.517 --> 18:06.784
ever since that day,

18:06.852 --> 18:09.253
you know, i always wanted
to study martial arts.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.659
then again, we never
had too much money,

18:14.726 --> 18:17.228
so i could never really enroll
in a martial-arts school.

18:17.296 --> 18:19.797
very confident and comfortable.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.567
But none of it's any good.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.936
i finally got the
chance when i was 14

18:25.003 --> 18:26.671
and started wrestling.

18:26.738 --> 18:29.207
and i enrolled myself into
a martial-arts school,

18:29.274 --> 18:31.876
and they actually let
me train there for free.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.611
so i feel like that
opportunity was a blessing.

18:51.763 --> 18:53.498
alex came to me and said,

18:53.565 --> 18:56.200
"georges, i feel i
want to fight jeffrey."

18:56.268 --> 18:57.568
i said, "you know what,

18:57.636 --> 18:59.670
"if you have the motivation
to fight this guy,

18:59.738 --> 19:01.105
that means you're motivated."

19:01.173 --> 19:03.174
and a fighter who's motivated

19:03.242 --> 19:05.176
to do something is
always very dangerous.

19:07.412 --> 19:09.680
i am very confident that
alex will win the fight.

19:09.748 --> 19:11.549
i mean, i believe
he has more tools,

19:11.617 --> 19:13.885
and he's very unorthodox.

19:13.952 --> 19:16.487
matchup control... it's important.

19:16.555 --> 19:18.556
So to get an early victory,

19:18.624 --> 19:21.526
it would be very nice
to retain control

19:21.593 --> 19:23.427
of the matchmaking process.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.434
there is no certainty
in mixed martial arts,

19:30.502 --> 19:32.537
but i think the odds
are on our side.

19:32.604 --> 19:35.907
excellent. you did very well.

19:35.974 --> 19:38.576
nice. you okay? good. nice.

19:44.883 --> 19:46.117
my name is jeff lentz.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.752
6 and 1 as a pro,

19:47.819 --> 19:50.388
coming from kurt pellegrino's
mma in new jersey.

19:50.455 --> 19:53.824
I would say jersey produces some
of the toughest guys around,

19:53.892 --> 19:55.626
and i promise to be one of them.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.937
i'm trying to get in
there and put a on you.

20:06.004 --> 20:07.371
i'm trying to hurt you.

20:07.439 --> 20:10.141
I want to finish the fight early,
put it viciously.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.443
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:12.511 --> 20:14.712
hey, hey! there you go.

20:14.780 --> 20:18.182
Him and dane were sparring a
lot in the backyard yesterday.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.484
Every time he engages,
he taps his foot.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.522
he's telling you
that he's coming in?

20:24.590 --> 20:25.656
right here, the right hand.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.724
bam! every time.

20:32.998 --> 20:35.933
the strategy is to pretty much
try to go for the knockout.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.568
and if not, and he gets
the chance to get on top,

20:37.636 --> 20:38.603
ground and pound.

20:44.343 --> 20:45.977
lentz is a tough competitor,

20:46.044 --> 20:49.213
and i think that he got
a perfect opportunity

20:49.281 --> 20:51.449
to come out and show
who he is as a fighter

20:51.516 --> 20:54.218
and put on a show.

20:55.754 --> 20:56.854
nice!

20:56.922 --> 20:58.222
Game plan is to break him.

20:58.290 --> 20:59.890
My game plan is to hurt him so bad,

20:59.958 --> 21:01.158
he wants to go home tomorrow.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.195
1...2...3...

21:04.263 --> 21:05.529
get him!

21:09.101 --> 21:11.135
I got coffee on my jersey.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.837
you drink coffee before the fight?

21:12.904 --> 21:14.572
i drink coffee every day.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.974
i love coffee.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.577
coffee and cigarettes?

21:19.645 --> 21:21.712
huh? is that...

21:21.780 --> 21:24.215
is that the fighter's...
is that the fighter's role?

21:24.283 --> 21:27.285
Obviously, we had a little
concern with his smoking.

21:27.352 --> 21:29.220
you know, smoking the cigarettes.

21:29.288 --> 21:33.224
And then i don't get that,
but his training went well.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.159
jeff.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.461
relax, homey. sit down.

21:37.529 --> 21:39.330
i was just playing.
I was checking it out.

21:39.398 --> 21:40.798
go get a cig.

21:42.167 --> 21:45.036
chill, man. take a smoke break.

21:53.111 --> 21:54.211
me and my brother,

21:54.279 --> 21:56.480
we were walking through
a mall one day,

21:56.548 --> 21:58.883
and we passed this
oriental shop, actually.

21:58.950 --> 22:00.384
and we walk inside,

22:00.452 --> 22:02.987
and they had a whole bunch
of these formal chinese gis

22:03.055 --> 22:04.588
like bruce lee used to wear.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.090
i'm like, "oh, man, this is crazy."

22:06.158 --> 22:07.892
and i was already in love
with bruce lee at that point,

22:07.959 --> 22:09.093
and i had to buy one.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.330
ready for battle!

22:12.397 --> 22:15.333
looking good! looking good!

22:15.400 --> 22:16.567
look at you.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.969
wah! wah!

22:19.037 --> 22:21.238
i don't hit. it hits...

22:21.306 --> 22:22.907
...all by itself.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.577
whole a lot of people
try to be men, you know,

22:26.645 --> 22:27.645
but there's a whole lot of people

22:27.713 --> 22:28.979
that knew what i could do.

22:29.047 --> 22:30.848
so i actually avoided
a whole lot of fights

22:30.916 --> 22:32.016
wearing that gi, you know.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.217
what up with this?

22:33.285 --> 22:34.652
that's a power braid.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.886
Ah.

22:35.954 --> 22:36.921
i saw that earlier.

22:36.988 --> 22:38.489
That's the jedi braid right there.

22:38.557 --> 22:39.824
yeah, you need to cut that.

22:39.891 --> 22:42.793
the rest looks real good, though.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.838
you know, everybody
gets that last-minute

22:53.905 --> 22:55.106
little bit of nervousness.

22:55.173 --> 22:56.407
Get a little bit of scared.

22:56.475 --> 22:57.575
not scared to get hurt...

22:57.642 --> 22:59.110
more scared to lose,

22:59.177 --> 23:01.345
especially in front of millions
and millions of people.

23:01.413 --> 23:02.980
these fights here
are the first time

23:03.048 --> 23:04.682
i ever fought with
my mother not here.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.717
i always bring my mom
to the fights, you know,

23:06.785 --> 23:08.953
'cause who wants to lose
in front of their mom?

23:09.020 --> 23:10.955
that always drives me harder,
you know.

23:11.022 --> 23:13.858
my parents are always
nervous <i>for</i> me.

23:13.925 --> 23:15.192
you know?

23:15.260 --> 23:17.294
so only god knows what
they're thinking at home.

23:37.115 --> 23:40.284
a philosophy that would help
me in this fight, i believe,

23:40.352 --> 23:43.254
is being as if you're
sleeping but not dreaming,

23:43.321 --> 23:45.689
you know, but being ready.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.591
basically, it's kind of saying,

23:47.659 --> 23:49.794
you're being ready
but not too tense.

23:49.861 --> 23:52.329
And, you know, you're calm,
but you're not asleep.

23:52.397 --> 23:54.598
you know, you're
kind of in between.

23:54.666 --> 23:56.634
you're ready for whatever to come,

23:56.701 --> 23:58.269
and you're able to react to it.

23:58.336 --> 23:59.970
you know, adaptation.

24:04.009 --> 24:05.810
i'm a karate guy.

24:05.877 --> 24:08.012
i'm gonna show him
some crazy kung fu

24:08.079 --> 24:09.380
you can definitely be a karate guy

24:09.448 --> 24:10.915
without the gi and the jumpsuit.

24:10.982 --> 24:12.917
that's just some stupid
to get himself noticed.

24:12.984 --> 24:13.984
he's gonna need that,

24:14.052 --> 24:15.219
'cause once i put him to sleep,

24:15.287 --> 24:16.353
nobody's gonna remember who he is.

24:26.998 --> 24:30.100
jeff says that he doesn't
necessarily take me seriously.

24:30.168 --> 24:31.535
you know?

24:31.603 --> 24:33.604
he will tell me that he
thinks i'm probably a joke

24:33.672 --> 24:34.738
and he'll run through me.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.106
but i think, deep down inside,

24:36.174 --> 24:37.608
he's a little nervous
about this fight.

24:41.513 --> 24:43.047
I'm not worried about him.

24:43.114 --> 24:44.548
i'm intimidated by no one, sir.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.188
i'm so sick that i
get to fight first.

24:51.256 --> 24:52.723
pumped.

24:52.791 --> 24:58.062
can't wait to kick the
stupid look off his face.

24:58.129 --> 24:59.497
me either.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.570
they don't see a thing.

25:20.819 --> 25:23.053
the more that i remain calm...

25:23.121 --> 25:26.457
Not that i'm able to think more,
but i'm just able to flow.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.093
You know, i'm able to
relax and let things go.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.794
I'm not trying to tense up.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.264
i'm not trying to keep
things in control,

25:33.331 --> 25:34.832
because there are
certain aspects of life

25:34.900 --> 25:35.966
that you just can't control.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.868
and the winner... alex.

25:42.974 --> 25:46.110
just a character, man.
That's it. he's not tough.

25:46.177 --> 25:47.578
i doubt he fought
anybody like me, man.

25:47.646 --> 25:49.980
Every second i'm coming for you,
i'm trying to hurt you.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.515
i'm not just trying to finish you.

25:51.583 --> 25:52.917
i'm not trying to submit you.

25:52.984 --> 25:54.485
i'm trying to hurt you, viciously.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.021
what a character.

25:57.088 --> 25:59.189
showtime now. let's move.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.892
let's do it, man.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.905
i'll be smiling the whole fight,
because if i don't enjoy it,

26:14.973 --> 26:17.508
i won't perform as
well as i want to.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.543
it might look like i'm
not taking him seriously,

26:19.611 --> 26:20.911
though i am,

26:20.979 --> 26:22.446
just like some people,
when they're in danger,

26:22.514 --> 26:23.847
they laugh.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.816
i used to get smacked
around by my parents a lot,

26:25.884 --> 26:27.251
because every time
i get in trouble,

26:27.319 --> 26:28.619
i couldn't help but smile.

26:54.379 --> 26:56.614
i'm here to impress my fans,
put on a good show.

26:56.681 --> 26:58.782
i'm gonna show you guys what
it's like to hurt somebody.

26:58.850 --> 26:59.950
i want to hurt him so bad

27:00.018 --> 27:01.685
that he wants to go
home the day after.

27:01.753 --> 27:03.187
he's never gonna
want to fight again.

27:30.715 --> 27:32.950

27:38.857 --> 27:40.658
all right, this fight
is two 5-minute rounds.

27:40.725 --> 27:42.092
if at the end of the second round,

27:42.160 --> 27:45.295
the judges declare it a draw,
we go to sudden victory.

33:49.127 --> 33:52.262
st. pierre: get the center.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.631
alex, you're waiting
a little too long.

33:54.699 --> 33:57.167
you're waiting a little too long.

33:57.235 --> 33:58.668
nice, alex, nice!

33:58.736 --> 34:00.404
hey!

34:00.471 --> 34:01.838

34:04.075 --> 34:06.376

34:08.045 --> 34:10.013
control the wrist, alex.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.716
there you go.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.684
watch the knees.

34:20.257 --> 34:22.859
jeff. jeff, keep it up.

34:22.927 --> 34:23.760
head up!

34:28.132 --> 34:32.002
Alex, try to turn him
away from that cage.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.204
get off the cage. get off the cage.

34:34.272 --> 34:36.373
hey!

34:40.311 --> 34:43.580
drop your hip! drop your hip!
Drop your hip!

34:43.648 --> 34:46.416
relax, relax, relax.

34:46.484 --> 34:50.053
get back on your feet, alex!

34:50.121 --> 34:52.856
control. shoulder strike.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.623
let's bring that right knee up.

34:54.692 --> 34:56.560
elbow.

35:10.174 --> 35:12.342
work your way up, alex.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.981

35:20.518 --> 35:22.319
arms up. arms up.

35:27.758 --> 35:29.960
keep it, keep it, keep it!

35:46.310 --> 35:48.912
nice! nice! nice! nice!

35:48.980 --> 35:50.947
you got it! you got it, alex!

35:51.015 --> 35:52.449
keep it low, alex.

35:52.517 --> 35:53.850
yay!

36:04.695 --> 36:08.031
<i>this fight replay is brought
to you by burger king.</i>

36:08.099 --> 36:09.866
<i>have it your way.</i>

36:09.934 --> 36:11.601
so, bruce leroy comes
out in the first round,

36:11.669 --> 36:13.036
throwing some flashy kicks.

36:14.639 --> 36:18.241
jeff uses his size and his strength

36:18.309 --> 36:20.043
to stack alex against the fence.

36:23.080 --> 36:27.083
lentz gets a huge judo throw
at the end of the round

36:27.151 --> 36:29.753
to basically put an exclamation
point on the end of the round.

36:29.820 --> 36:32.455
he wins the round
very convincingly.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.324
i got you, buddy!

36:35.993 --> 36:39.029
so, second round, they come out,
lentz is going for the knockout.

36:43.768 --> 36:45.335
get off the cage.

36:45.403 --> 36:48.872
st. pierre: i was more happy
to see alex on the bottom

36:48.940 --> 36:52.542
against jeffrey than seeing
him stuck against the fence,

36:52.610 --> 36:55.345
'cause i know alex has
a good triangle choke.

36:57.315 --> 36:59.149
i knew, when i saw the
triangle at the end,

36:59.217 --> 37:01.418
he was hooking the wrong leg.

37:01.485 --> 37:04.588
hook the leg, alex! hook the leg!

37:04.655 --> 37:06.656
the other leg! the other leg!

37:08.759 --> 37:10.594
kind of almost saw it coming.

37:10.661 --> 37:12.195
it was like, "oh, there it comes."

37:12.263 --> 37:13.363
bam. triangle.

37:13.431 --> 37:15.131
knew he wasn't gonna get out of it,

37:15.199 --> 37:18.001
so, man, disappointing loss today.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.905
i just didn't handle things right.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.441
i got caught, and instead
of defending the right way,

37:24.508 --> 37:26.443
you know, i just figured
i'd muscle through.

37:28.813 --> 37:31.114
He had pretty good cardio,
i got to tell you that much,

37:31.182 --> 37:33.049
for smoking cigarettes and
drinking all the time.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.824
i don't really root for guys on here,
but i like this kid.

37:40.891 --> 37:43.860
i'll 100% admit i like bruce leroy.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.529
i like the kid's personality.
he seems like a good kid.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.098
so i was happy to see him win.

37:48.165 --> 37:50.700
winner... bruce leroy,
triangle choke.

37:54.338 --> 37:56.239
told you i'm tough enough.

37:56.307 --> 37:58.842
you didn't believe me,
but you were tough, too, man.

37:58.909 --> 38:00.810
You're a fighter.

38:00.878 --> 38:03.146
i let everybody down, man.
it happens.

38:03.214 --> 38:04.914
you know, what are you gonna do?

38:04.982 --> 38:06.850
sorry, mom, dad,
everybody back home.

38:06.917 --> 38:08.051
i didn't mean to lose.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.786
my apologies, you know?

38:09.854 --> 38:12.422
i'll be back to it soon.
don't worry.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.190
thank you, coach.

38:14.258 --> 38:15.659
you'll come back. don't worry.

38:15.726 --> 38:18.226
you might have a chance
to come back. Yes, sir.

38:19.363 --> 38:20.997
i feel amazing.

38:21.065 --> 38:23.633
it's incredible that i
could pick up this win,

38:23.701 --> 38:25.402
especially finish it
in the second round,

38:25.469 --> 38:27.103
when i was losing the first round.

38:27.171 --> 38:28.705
he was a tough

38:28.773 --> 38:30.740
and coming out fast,
coming out hard,

38:30.808 --> 38:33.943
and i just... i tried to
hang in there, you know.

38:34.011 --> 38:35.779
it's an awesome feeling
to finish this fight.

38:35.846 --> 38:38.648
St. pierre: you start come
with some kung fu, alex.

38:38.716 --> 38:40.850
A message to all those guys

38:40.918 --> 38:43.253
that are unlucky enough to
face me in the next round is,

38:43.321 --> 38:45.021
i'm bruce leroy, man.

38:45.089 --> 38:46.856
you better get ready
for a goddamn fight

38:46.924 --> 38:48.058
when i get in there,

38:48.125 --> 38:49.859
because i ain't handing
no free tickets.

38:49.927 --> 38:51.861
st. pierre: hey!

38:51.929 --> 38:53.330
what a character.

39:03.307 --> 39:06.976
<i>on the next episode
of "the ultimate fighter"...</i>

39:10.648 --> 39:14.818
<i>...alex caceres goes too far with
his post-fight boasting...</i>

39:14.885 --> 39:16.820
in a way, you were underestimating

39:16.887 --> 39:18.788
my talents and skills, you know.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.090
I got to give props to jeff

39:20.157 --> 39:22.792
for not stabbing bruce
in the eye with a knife.

39:24.895 --> 39:28.331
<i>...josh koscheck accuses his
team of losing focus...</i>

39:28.399 --> 39:29.532
i'm disappointed with the workout.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.468
complaining, crying.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.669
when we're in here,
we're in here to train.

39:32.737 --> 39:34.904
get your mind right.

39:34.972 --> 39:38.541
<i>boxing legend mike tyson stops
by the gym.</i>

39:38.609 --> 39:40.844
and i told you,
you were my idol, growing up.

39:42.847 --> 39:44.781
i'm just really happy to
be involved with this.

39:44.849 --> 39:47.050
<i>who will enter the cage</i>

39:47.118 --> 39:51.755
<i>for a shot at becoming the
next ultimate fighter?</i>
