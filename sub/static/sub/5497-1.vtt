01:00.294 --> 01:02.496
(Loud music on headphones)

01:13.641 --> 01:15.776
(Screams)

01:21.415 --> 01:23.083
(Growling)

02:30.551 --> 02:33.821
(Crows chirping)

02:33.854 --> 02:36.757
(Thunder rumbles)

02:42.396 --> 02:45.299
So...

02:45.333 --> 02:47.835
My place...

02:47.868 --> 02:49.303
Or yours?

02:58.446 --> 03:00.314
(Door opens)

03:02.616 --> 03:04.718
Make yourself at home.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.853
Thank you.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.670
Here you go.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.344
Here's one...

03:57.305 --> 03:59.340
So what do you do?

04:00.641 --> 04:01.875
I'm an investor.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.047
Mining.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.450
Diamonds.

04:11.652 --> 04:14.555
Actually, I'm more on
the human side of things.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.959
Where are you from?

04:18.992 --> 04:20.628
I'm from Paris.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.497
- Paris.
- Mm-hmm.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.399
I love Paris.

04:26.967 --> 04:27.935
(Laughs)

04:27.968 --> 04:29.403
My ex is from there.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.575
Are you looking
for a replacement?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.511
Only if you feed me

04:37.545 --> 04:38.712
with news.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.370
I'm Zoe Porter.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.038
And you're watching
avi world news.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.708
Here are the highlights
of the day.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.678
Dr. Danielle Laura,
financial advisor from Toronto,

05:10.711 --> 05:12.813
is among several
journalists missing

05:12.846 --> 05:16.384
after an alleged
vampire attack in Paris.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.420
It is speculated that drakula
is trying to scare the city

05:19.453 --> 05:20.754
into submission,

05:20.788 --> 05:23.557
a tactic used by drakula
and his cult members

05:23.591 --> 05:25.693
for centuries.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.696
Among the missing
is Ronnie keld from Paris

05:28.729 --> 05:31.432
who was traveling through
the carpathian mountains.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.701
We now go live
to Paris, France

05:33.734 --> 05:35.703
where our correspondent,
Beatrice arsenault,

05:35.736 --> 05:38.706
has the latest.
Hi, Beatrice.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.442
What can you tell us
about the missing victim?

05:41.475 --> 05:43.010
Hi, Zoe.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.646
It isn't clear
what drakula's motives would be,

05:45.679 --> 05:48.115
but there is a lot of
speculation that the victims

05:48.148 --> 05:51.619
were murdered because of
their connections to the media.

05:51.652 --> 05:55.389
There has been a lot
more exposure on drakula

05:55.423 --> 05:57.825
and the cult in recent times.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.928
And this attack
could be meant as a warning.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.398
Can you tell us anything about
the leaked video footage?

06:04.432 --> 06:05.866
The video
has been taken down,

06:05.899 --> 06:09.770
and avi news
has evidence

06:09.803 --> 06:12.139
against some of
the drakula cult members.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.141
Is our legal system
failing us

06:14.174 --> 06:16.076
when it comes to drakula
and his cult?

06:16.109 --> 06:17.911
Your thoughts.

06:17.945 --> 06:22.783
Well, Paris sentiment is that
it is time to ratify our laws

06:22.816 --> 06:24.785
so that we have
great authority

06:24.818 --> 06:29.056
to prosecute vampires
and vampire supporters.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.592
They are a cult
that has made it clear

06:31.625 --> 06:33.594
they have little regard

06:33.627 --> 06:36.196
for all victims...
And life itself.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.065
There are rumors...

06:38.098 --> 06:41.101
Hey, emmy, it's me.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.936
Pick up. It's urgent.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.705
Listen, I'm coming to Paris.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.973
Call me back.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.280
(Camera shutters clicking)

08:00.313 --> 08:02.783
(Reporters chattering)

08:20.701 --> 08:24.738
People need
vampires because...

08:24.772 --> 08:25.973
We are sad.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.612
Politics suck,

08:31.645 --> 08:33.513
country sucks.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.784
We need to see
drakula for...

08:37.818 --> 08:39.119
For fantasy,

08:39.152 --> 08:40.921
for...

08:40.953 --> 08:42.823
For laughing.

08:42.856 --> 08:46.193
For thinking
about love and...

08:46.226 --> 08:48.562
And, yeah...

08:48.596 --> 08:49.997
To dream.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.303
Drakula and his cult members
have been the prime suspects

08:56.336 --> 08:58.739
in many missing
persons cases.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.108
The mission
is normalization.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.977
This mission
is the new order.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.146
Drakula's stocks
are set to triple

09:06.179 --> 09:08.315
as he gains support.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.651
Drakula is seen
as a kind of superstar

09:10.684 --> 09:12.185
who is half crazy

09:12.219 --> 09:15.923
trying to get
the inside scoop for the case.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.659
The death toll from
the latest vampire attack

09:18.692 --> 09:20.327
continues to rise.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.599
I love watching vampires.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.835
I feel great when I see one.

09:31.304 --> 09:34.708
I feel very good inside.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.143
Like I'm somebody.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.792
You are the usual?

09:51.825 --> 09:52.926
Yeah.

09:54.662 --> 09:55.796
Watch the street.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.264
Sorry.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.378
(Speaks French)

10:17.217 --> 10:18.385
(Door buzzer buzzes)

10:21.288 --> 10:23.290
(Shower running)

10:30.698 --> 10:34.367
Oh, how nice to see you!

10:34.401 --> 10:37.070
Emmy!
Emmy!

10:37.104 --> 10:39.339
It's good to see you!
When did you get in?

10:39.372 --> 10:40.874
Yesterday.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.043
Valia didn't tell me
you were here.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.812
- I'm happy.
- (Moans)

10:46.346 --> 10:48.849
Thank you so much
for doing this with me.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.417
Hey, we're in
this together.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.338
You're gonna have
the adventure of a lifetime.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.372
Mm.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.841
Oh, you know,

11:13.874 --> 11:15.042
it's so good to work
with people

11:15.075 --> 11:17.010
who are interested
in vampires.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.979
- I'm stoked.
- Ugh!

11:19.012 --> 11:20.247
I'm just gonna
have a quick shower.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.348
I'm so jet-lagged.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.883
I got it.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.352
Hey, try to stay up
as long as you can.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.820
I'll try.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.690
(Police sirens)

11:36.429 --> 11:38.398
Oh, thank you.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.108
You want?

11:48.141 --> 11:50.077
It doesn't make sense.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.846
Who disclosed details
about the killings

11:52.880 --> 11:55.015
on social networking sites?

11:55.048 --> 11:58.151
And why were incriminating
photographs removed from sites?

11:58.185 --> 12:01.121
Paranoid and narcissistic
creeps, cult members,

12:01.154 --> 12:02.790
who intimidate people,

12:02.823 --> 12:05.793
savaging the reputation
of drakula's family

12:05.826 --> 12:07.027
and their lives,
protecting their

12:07.060 --> 12:08.929
whereabouts.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.831
I know that
the images are sensational

12:10.864 --> 12:13.400
and very explicit.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.436
There's every possibility
that it could get worse.

12:16.469 --> 12:20.774
According to my source,
what they have is amazing.

12:20.808 --> 12:21.942
Why this?

12:21.975 --> 12:23.310
Why now?

12:23.343 --> 12:25.445
I'm interested in
finding the truth.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.447
That you will
never get to sell.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.416
You know
that it's impossible.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.884
They will
finish you off

12:30.918 --> 12:32.552
like agina.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.822
There are things
you shouldn't interfere with.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.123
Go home or write
about something else.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.958
No, no.
You don't understand.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.927
I want to hear
their side of the story.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.029
It's a huge media interest.

12:45.032 --> 12:48.201
The mission is called
normalization.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.903
The term "normalization"

12:49.937 --> 12:51.839
is used by
this group of vampires

12:51.872 --> 12:55.008
to describe the sect
who kill with impunity

12:55.042 --> 12:57.978
resulting in
a civil unrest and demand.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.279
In their view,
this division

12:59.312 --> 13:00.814
is the new order.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.482
Uniting a family

13:02.515 --> 13:05.886
dedicated
to an heroic existence.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.989
Those alive,
those not yet born,

13:09.022 --> 13:11.391
and those already dead.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.793
Okay. So?

13:15.428 --> 13:18.331
So there's slow burn
in process at the castle.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.333
Put the media on.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.502
Ignore and move on.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.004
What's the issue really?

13:24.037 --> 13:27.040
This issue is privacy
not behavior.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.575
It's jealousy.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.211
The fuckers aren't as rich
and having as much fun?

13:31.244 --> 13:32.512
Surprise, surprise.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.547
It appears
history repeats itself

13:34.581 --> 13:36.984
and is a good fit
for the silly world

13:37.017 --> 13:37.951
of journalists.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.219
Mm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

13:39.252 --> 13:42.489
(Giggles)

13:42.522 --> 13:45.458
It's my job to cut through
the spirit of social rebellion

13:45.492 --> 13:48.028
so the rest of the world
can dignify it.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.897
But it's up to the world
to decide.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.865
I'm sure that the people
of transylvania will be happy

13:51.899 --> 13:54.334
the country
is being talked about...

13:54.367 --> 13:57.070
Famous once more.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.906
The issue is

13:58.939 --> 14:02.409
no people will criticize
drakula's family out of fear.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.278
The nominal role in society
is an insult to people

14:05.312 --> 14:08.315
who have generally risked
their lives or body parts

14:08.348 --> 14:12.185
because no one will dare to say
a bad word about the family.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.888
But drakula doesn't care
what you think

14:14.922 --> 14:17.424
and neither do the vampire.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.159
What the fuck
do you think it is?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.929
Twilight?
Sleeping in coffins?

14:21.962 --> 14:23.296
A stake through the heart?

14:23.330 --> 14:25.032
Oh, oh, I got it.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.299
Ah, ah, ah...

14:26.333 --> 14:28.568
It's changing
shapes and forms.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.270
Oh, I gotta go!

14:30.303 --> 14:31.504
(Chuckles)

14:38.611 --> 14:40.447
Text me pictures
of the cult?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.082
I want to see.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.417
You never listen, Hannah.

14:44.451 --> 14:45.452
(Scoffs)

14:45.485 --> 14:46.886
See you soon.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.423
(Thunder rumbles)

14:50.457 --> 14:52.492
(Police siren wailing)

15:07.740 --> 15:09.476
(Computer keys clicking)

15:09.509 --> 15:11.344
I'm hungry
for the new order.

15:13.013 --> 15:16.216
Yeah, we all news lovers
suffering from...

15:17.617 --> 15:19.586
Yes.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.622
I'm willing to risk fines
for my company if...

15:22.655 --> 15:24.291
Yeah,

15:24.324 --> 15:27.127
if the benefits for boosting
circulation and revenues

15:27.160 --> 15:30.130
outweighs any fines
for breaching the law.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.465
Okay.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.701
See you at the party.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.970
Okay, bye.

15:37.004 --> 15:39.472
Meeting with Christian
is set up.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.308
Who is he?

15:41.341 --> 15:43.243
This guy I met
in Vancouver.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.281
Is he a journalist?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.150
Nope,

15:50.183 --> 15:51.751
but I want him to help us.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.321
To get him involved.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.688
His money
and his connections

15:55.722 --> 15:58.125
could get us info on the cult.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.092
(Phone chimes)

16:01.194 --> 16:03.696
Hey, Nate arrives
tomorrow from Amsterdam.

16:03.730 --> 16:07.134
He is the journalist
I was talking about.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.769
Great.
Can't wait to meet him.

16:09.802 --> 16:13.640
Mm, did Xavier
send you the pictures?

16:13.673 --> 16:16.976
Uh-uh. He's going to
encrypt them first.

16:27.154 --> 16:30.057
- Glass of wine?
- Oh.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.325
That sounds lovely.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.172
(Bell tolling)

17:05.092 --> 17:08.095
(Horn honking)

19:29.569 --> 19:31.538
Oh, it's so
good to see you.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.408
You had a good trip?
Are you tired?

19:35.442 --> 19:36.809
No, no, no.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.647
But I do have to meet
Xavier in two hours.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.748
Cool.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.949
Hey, come on, let's go.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.617
Yeah, let's go.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.466
(Bell tolls)

20:02.469 --> 20:03.936
(Heavy exhale)

20:07.474 --> 20:08.808
(Exhales)

20:19.486 --> 20:20.587
(Growls)

20:22.455 --> 20:25.658
Isn't she beautiful?

20:33.466 --> 20:35.368
New visitors in town.

20:36.936 --> 20:40.540
What do they know?

20:43.310 --> 20:46.279
I don't know, Leon.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.915
Things could get

20:48.948 --> 20:52.785
out of hand, Corvinus.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.921
What do they want?

20:54.954 --> 20:57.657
(Moans)

20:57.690 --> 21:02.529
They want to be us.

21:02.562 --> 21:03.696
(Moans)

21:05.965 --> 21:10.337
We're going to have to find
a new environment for them,

21:10.370 --> 21:13.306
one in which
they can grant protection

21:13.340 --> 21:16.309
for lives
and the lives of others?

21:16.343 --> 21:18.311
(Moans)

21:26.386 --> 21:29.021
I'm going to send you
to transylvania.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.757
(Moans)

21:30.790 --> 21:32.825
You'll remain there
until we find a reason

21:32.859 --> 21:34.293
to make a change.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.733
(Moans)

22:04.857 --> 22:08.895
I wish to present Nate,
a good friend of mine.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.431
- Nice to meet you.
- Mm-hmm.

22:14.767 --> 22:15.968
(Speaking French)

22:29.649 --> 22:30.983
No.

22:36.756 --> 22:37.990
Let's see a price.

22:48.635 --> 22:50.570
(Laughs)

22:50.603 --> 22:51.871
(Speaking French)

23:07.854 --> 23:09.021
Okay?

23:09.055 --> 23:10.457
Okay.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.058
Okay.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.526
That's okay for you?

23:22.835 --> 23:25.572
No, just, uh,
I just want this key.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.542
I want to get cracking.

23:29.576 --> 23:30.877
You guys are heading out?

23:30.910 --> 23:32.679
- Yep.
- Well...

23:35.682 --> 23:37.684
It was a pleasure.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.498
- Bye, Nate.
- Merci.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.469
- Sure we can trust them?
- Yeah, we can.

23:56.503 --> 23:57.737
It's okay.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.527
(Chattering)

24:31.037 --> 24:32.605
Hey!

24:32.639 --> 24:33.773
- Hi!
- Hey.

24:33.806 --> 24:34.974
- Oh, my God!
- Look at you!

24:36.709 --> 24:38.745
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

24:51.824 --> 24:54.093
(Speaking French)

25:19.218 --> 25:22.054
(Laughs)

25:22.088 --> 25:25.057
(Gasping)

25:25.091 --> 25:27.927
(Panting)

25:30.096 --> 25:32.865
(Tapping)

25:43.142 --> 25:44.611
We have to talk.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.278
I have something
important to tell you.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.748
We have to be
in sync on this.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.617
We're in sync, baby.

25:50.650 --> 25:51.951
Yeah?

25:51.984 --> 25:53.119
Okay, then.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.159
- You're blushing.
- Me?

26:00.192 --> 26:01.694
- Yeah.
- No.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.596
- Yeah.
- (Giggles)

26:04.997 --> 26:06.198
That's a nice place.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.175
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.110
Cheers.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.112
(Speaking French)

26:23.850 --> 26:27.019
Ooh.
A hugger?

26:27.053 --> 26:28.921
- A kisser.
- Oh.

26:32.324 --> 26:33.660
Ask her.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.962
Do you mind if I
steal him for a bit?

26:35.995 --> 26:37.296
No, it's okay.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.765
No, it's all right.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.733
It's all right,
it's okay.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.034
Okay.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.036
I'm not into a foursome.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.739
After tonight,
you will be.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.141
Guys, meet Christian.

26:49.175 --> 26:51.177
Hey, I'm Nathaniel.
You can call me Nate.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.979
I stream video footage

26:53.012 --> 26:54.681
and broadcast
the best fucking footage

26:54.714 --> 26:55.982
you'll ever see

26:56.015 --> 26:57.016
or hear.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.685
(Chuckles)

26:58.718 --> 27:01.353
Hi. Emmy.
Editor for az magazine

27:01.387 --> 27:04.056
and I'll publish your
mother's ass off.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.792
My mother's ass?

27:05.825 --> 27:07.226
Hi, I'm Xavier.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.761
(Speaking French)

27:10.329 --> 27:12.164
Thanks, guys, for coming.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.966
And for helping me
with this project.

27:15.702 --> 27:18.237
It really means a lot to me.

27:18.270 --> 27:21.173
(Laughing, chattering)

27:47.399 --> 27:50.770
We need to look everywhere,
online, the fucking church,

27:50.803 --> 27:52.104
library...

27:52.138 --> 27:54.907
People, places, names.

27:54.941 --> 27:57.243
The bloggers on this...
Talk to people.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.277
What about
the government?

27:58.310 --> 27:59.712
The cult?

27:59.746 --> 28:02.214
Need a code or a sign.

28:02.248 --> 28:05.752
I promise
I will publish everything.

28:05.785 --> 28:09.088
It's a flattering
profile on the cult.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.423
We need information
and we need it fast.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.933
(Speaking French)

28:23.936 --> 28:26.806
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

28:26.839 --> 28:29.108
Made extra money.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.442
How much? How much?

28:30.476 --> 28:32.144
(Chuckles)
How much money?

28:33.980 --> 28:35.181
Big money.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.356
(Speaking French)

29:17.156 --> 29:20.092
I was part of the group
studying minerals in water.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.360
Cool.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.162
And did you see
those kids with...?

29:25.164 --> 29:26.032
Hey, Christian.

29:28.334 --> 29:31.037
Christian tells me
that he built a school

29:31.070 --> 29:33.339
in Africa? Romania?

29:33.372 --> 29:35.341
That's great.

29:35.374 --> 29:39.011
Maybe he can take us there.
We can blog about it.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.413
Well, I got to go.

29:41.447 --> 29:42.882
See you soon.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.150
Bye.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.157
Well...

29:51.190 --> 29:54.560
Let's have dinner
on Friday night and talk.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.432
- Deal.
- Deal.

30:20.419 --> 30:21.854
(Door opens)

30:23.956 --> 30:25.491
(Door closes)

30:25.524 --> 30:27.159
(Laughs)

30:40.572 --> 30:42.374
What are you looking at?

30:42.408 --> 30:45.044
- You.
- Hmm.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.513
- Are you drunk again?
- No, I'm not drunk.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.381
You're working too much.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.586
I'm a little bit drunk.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.898
Time, time,

31:05.932 --> 31:07.333
what can I do?

31:12.571 --> 31:16.943
We need a strategy
to control the enemy and...

31:16.976 --> 31:18.444
And compromise
their weakness.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.454
You can hack
into their email.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.023
Would it be safe?

31:31.057 --> 31:33.092
- Safe is boring.
- Yeah, I know.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.027
But we have
to communicate mostly by

31:35.061 --> 31:37.663
encrypted Internet chat.

31:37.696 --> 31:40.166
Melanie thinks
footage was leaked

31:40.199 --> 31:44.303
from a former cult member
to a finance journalist.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.105
- Melanie?
- Yeah.

31:46.138 --> 31:49.208
Nate and I met her
earlier tonight.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.277
(Goth music plays)

33:04.750 --> 33:07.053
(Goth music continues)

34:10.882 --> 34:12.484
(Groans)

35:04.803 --> 35:06.572
(Gasps)

35:15.947 --> 35:17.216
(Panting)

35:23.722 --> 35:26.425
(Sobbing)

35:36.568 --> 35:37.869
Why?

35:37.903 --> 35:41.207
Why did you do this?

35:41.240 --> 35:42.641
Stop.

35:56.388 --> 35:58.724
Why?

35:58.757 --> 36:01.827
Why did you do it?

36:01.860 --> 36:03.529
(Sobbing)

36:05.431 --> 36:07.733
Oh, my poor baby.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.668
You don't like my pleasure.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.461
(Gagging)

36:54.613 --> 36:57.883
(Bell tolling)

37:26.445 --> 37:28.414
This is not drakula's castle.

37:28.447 --> 37:29.815
This is vlad's castle,

37:29.848 --> 37:31.750
the real one.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.456
Seven castles
all claiming to be

37:37.489 --> 37:38.957
drakula's this,

37:38.990 --> 37:41.327
drakula's that,
drakula's...

37:41.360 --> 37:44.330
How the fuck
am I supposed to find it?

37:44.363 --> 37:47.666
Not all transylvanian sites
are associated with vlad.

37:47.699 --> 37:51.570
That guy was a
bad ass motherfucker.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.872
To join his legion,
each man had to let out

37:53.905 --> 37:57.543
blood into a glass
from which they all drank

37:57.576 --> 38:00.346
uniting the legion in death.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.314
To this day,
people claim they see him

38:02.348 --> 38:03.349
riding a horse

38:03.382 --> 38:05.417
in the carpathian mountains.

38:05.451 --> 38:08.019
- Where did you hear that?
- Oh, my dad is an historian.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.622
I grew up in those stories.

38:19.097 --> 38:22.000
(Reading names)

38:23.769 --> 38:27.473
They are painters.
Don't get it.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.007
You know what?

38:29.040 --> 38:31.510
Let's Cypher the names
and send it to Nate.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.611
You bet.

38:34.012 --> 38:38.417
Secret crimes.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.990
May...

38:45.023 --> 38:47.526
May... Me...

38:47.559 --> 38:49.528
It's a g.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.697
Gula.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.632
- Caligula.
- (Email tone)

38:53.665 --> 38:54.833
This is what Nate sent.

38:54.866 --> 38:57.569
Look.
Here.

38:57.603 --> 39:00.872
"The cult extorted
cash and property,

39:00.906 --> 39:03.942
facilitated human
trafficking for blood."

39:03.975 --> 39:07.779
"Over the past year,
the cult has launched

39:07.813 --> 39:10.048
one reality
television series."

39:10.081 --> 39:13.051
"The cult is filming
sacraments on drakula

39:13.084 --> 39:16.021
based in caligula"?

39:16.054 --> 39:18.056
The Roman emperor caligula

39:18.089 --> 39:21.793
who used vile means
to get to the throne.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.665
So the cult
is making films?

39:26.698 --> 39:28.967
They're doing remakes

39:29.000 --> 39:33.004
based on old cult classics.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.139
Let's go.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.128
It consists of more than
a hundred engravings...

39:57.162 --> 39:59.197
More than 50 drawings,

39:59.230 --> 40:01.099
- and encrypted Internet code.
- Okay,

40:01.132 --> 40:04.470
but is there anything on it
about the cult in transylvania?

40:04.503 --> 40:06.872
- I couldn't break the code.
- (Sighs)

40:06.905 --> 40:08.607
Nate, you have
to be careful.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.678
Good luck.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.523
I've decoded
some of Xavier's data.

40:57.556 --> 40:59.658
Looks pretty interesting.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.627
Oh, my proxy server's
being so slow today.

41:03.729 --> 41:05.263
You know, looks like
there's a lot of information

41:05.296 --> 41:06.798
here about the royals

41:06.832 --> 41:09.635
and some prince
of transylvania.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.603
Note to self.

41:11.637 --> 41:14.139
Some of the names
I was able to crack, however,

41:14.172 --> 41:16.875
looks like they are linked
to some sort of live footage.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.544
(Snapping fingers)
It's gotta be, um...

41:18.577 --> 41:21.179
Yes. A movie called
"secret crimes."

41:21.212 --> 41:22.648
Look for it.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.153
(Computer beeps)

41:28.186 --> 41:31.523
Judging by these names,
they could be doing films

41:31.557 --> 41:33.892
based on these peoples' work.

41:33.925 --> 41:36.061
Bathory.

41:36.094 --> 41:38.564
Mm, interesting.

41:38.597 --> 41:40.265
But Elizabeth Bathory
wasn't the painter.

41:40.298 --> 41:41.767
She was a serial killer...

41:41.800 --> 41:43.735
(Laughs)

41:43.769 --> 41:46.538
Bathing in her victim's blood
to retain her beauty and youth.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.608
That's
the fucking name.

41:49.641 --> 41:50.809
"Bathory."

41:50.842 --> 41:53.211
Encode it
and see what happens.

41:53.244 --> 41:56.047
Could be ciphered.
Type "countess."

41:57.583 --> 41:58.650
(Computer beeps)

42:02.788 --> 42:03.855
(Beep, beep)

42:07.225 --> 42:08.760
(Beeping)

42:08.794 --> 42:10.295
Bingo!
Hah!

42:10.328 --> 42:12.764
Okay, here.

42:12.798 --> 42:14.933
Type this in.

42:14.966 --> 42:16.234
See if it works.

42:16.267 --> 42:21.206
Uh, en dot walashia,
slash, movie.

42:25.744 --> 42:27.679
Nothing?

42:27.713 --> 42:29.180
Try zalia.

42:29.214 --> 42:30.548
(Beep, beep)

42:32.751 --> 42:34.886
- (Beep, beep)
- Ah, look at that.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.888
One-time conspirator
and cult leader

42:36.922 --> 42:39.891
planting fear
and physical terror.

42:39.925 --> 42:41.893
Fuck.

42:41.927 --> 42:43.161
- (Loud noise)
- (Gasping)

42:47.633 --> 42:50.035
Here are the codes and signs
you are looking for.

42:52.804 --> 42:55.774
Okay. The money
is in your account.

42:55.807 --> 42:56.975
Fuck.

42:57.008 --> 42:58.844
Thank you.

42:58.877 --> 43:00.712
You must be careful.

43:04.683 --> 43:05.651
(Beep)

43:10.689 --> 43:12.791
Is that the same drive?

43:12.824 --> 43:13.992
It all came from Xavier.

43:14.025 --> 43:15.026
(Computer beeps)

43:35.714 --> 43:37.148
Hey.

43:37.182 --> 43:39.250
Looks like LA Bella lomond

43:39.284 --> 43:42.120
hacked into the email
of some corvinas

43:42.153 --> 43:45.090
exposing the wrongdoings
of the cult.

43:45.123 --> 43:48.026
Who the fuck is corvinas,
and why are we following him?

43:50.028 --> 43:50.996
You're gonna
have to ask Xavier

43:51.029 --> 43:52.030
if he can get us

43:52.063 --> 43:53.131
into a high-tech
facility.

44:31.236 --> 44:33.271
(Knocking on door)

44:47.786 --> 44:49.220
Okay, you gotta be
kidding me, right?

44:49.254 --> 44:51.857
Oh, come on.
Old technology dies hard.

44:53.959 --> 44:56.061
- We're gonna die here.
- No.

44:56.094 --> 44:57.929
It's exactly
what we need.

44:57.963 --> 44:59.397
What? 1980's?

44:59.430 --> 45:03.134
No. 1980's, yes.
1970's, that thing,

45:03.168 --> 45:05.070
- if it works.
- Ah, cool.

45:05.103 --> 45:06.404
You guys wanna
see what I did?

45:06.437 --> 45:08.273
- Yeah.
- Come on.

45:08.306 --> 45:09.707
Now take a seat.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.485
(Computer keys clicking)

45:20.518 --> 45:22.487
(Beep)

45:22.520 --> 45:23.789
(Beep)

45:23.822 --> 45:25.223
Oh, click on the fish.

45:40.338 --> 45:41.840
Holy fuck.

45:50.882 --> 45:52.050
(Woman whimpers)

46:13.438 --> 46:15.406
(Whimpers)

46:25.851 --> 46:29.454
It's a tough life
being a messiah.

46:29.487 --> 46:32.958
Unfortunately, I can't be
your Mary magdalene

46:32.991 --> 46:36.461
and bathe your feet.

46:36.494 --> 46:39.197
- However...
- (Crying)

46:39.230 --> 46:41.432
I can save you from this

46:41.466 --> 46:43.134
if you give me
the name of your fellow

46:43.168 --> 46:45.837
investigative journalist.

46:45.871 --> 46:47.873
I don't know her name.

46:47.906 --> 46:49.174
Oh.

47:04.923 --> 47:08.393
I shall be guilty
of drinking your blood.

47:08.426 --> 47:10.261
Let me prove myself

47:10.295 --> 47:13.231
and so to let me
eat of your body,

47:13.264 --> 47:15.233
let me drink
of the cup.

47:15.266 --> 47:16.434
Oh...

47:19.004 --> 47:20.471
My martyr.

47:40.158 --> 47:42.460
(Church bell tolls)

47:50.936 --> 47:52.337
(Bell tolls)

51:36.794 --> 51:38.596
(Coughing)

52:11.729 --> 52:13.498
(Groans)

52:23.441 --> 52:25.743
(Laughs)

52:30.215 --> 52:32.317
(Shouts)

52:34.785 --> 52:37.655
Oh...

53:03.881 --> 53:05.316
Oh, my...

53:06.917 --> 53:07.952
What?

53:09.854 --> 53:13.224
Xavier was found dead.
It's all over the news.

53:13.258 --> 53:14.292
Look.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.502
(Sobbing)

54:04.342 --> 54:06.277
(Computer beeps)
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

54:06.311 --> 54:07.612
Take a look at this!

54:07.645 --> 54:08.813
Come here!

54:11.349 --> 54:13.418
My battery is very low.

54:13.451 --> 54:15.953
That's the missing girl
veronique!

54:15.986 --> 54:18.623
Please.

54:18.656 --> 54:20.257
Please help me.

54:22.327 --> 54:23.894
I've been abducted.

54:25.730 --> 54:27.698
I'm thirsty.

54:27.732 --> 54:29.600
I want blood.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.868
Hello.

56:26.951 --> 56:28.853
We have to find that place.

56:32.790 --> 56:34.158
(Laughs)

56:38.796 --> 56:40.931
Wanna do it here?

56:40.965 --> 56:41.999
Yep.

56:47.838 --> 56:50.608
There is a slow explosion
in the cult

56:50.641 --> 56:52.477
and a subject
of controlled silence

56:52.510 --> 56:54.779
by the dominant forces.

56:54.812 --> 56:56.213
There can be no motivation

56:56.246 --> 56:58.816
other than greed.

56:58.849 --> 57:02.219
Hannah David,
world news, Paris.

57:02.252 --> 57:03.454
Cut!

57:05.690 --> 57:07.558
Looks great, hon.
Good job.

57:07.592 --> 57:08.759
Okay, cool.
Let's go.

57:43.628 --> 57:45.963
(Growls, chuckles)

57:56.541 --> 57:59.677
(Woman screams)

58:22.700 --> 58:24.268
(Whimpering)

59:04.374 --> 59:05.943
(Growling)

59:58.162 --> 01:00:01.098
(Heavy breathing)

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:01.058
Is everything all right?

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:02.359
Yes.

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:03.794
Are you sure?

01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:18.709
I was lying on the sofa...

01:01:18.743 --> 01:01:20.711
Naked and it hit me.

01:01:20.745 --> 01:01:23.147
You have connections
in transylvania.

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:26.150
So...

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:31.455
What's the event?

01:01:31.488 --> 01:01:34.258
I want to find veronique,
a missing girl.

01:01:36.827 --> 01:01:38.095
A vampire.

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:39.997
Where?

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:43.033
In transylvania.

01:01:43.067 --> 01:01:45.903
How do you know
she's there?

01:01:45.936 --> 01:01:48.839
Sources.

01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:50.107
She can be anywhere.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.408
Trust me.

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.811
She's there...

01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:55.445
Somewhere.

01:01:55.479 --> 01:01:59.750
If I can leak this,
it will be a triumph.

01:01:59.784 --> 01:02:01.952
It could work.

01:02:01.986 --> 01:02:03.187
It will cost you.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:08.292
But I don't see why not.

01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:11.996
How much?

01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:14.131
10, 20 gs.

01:02:18.969 --> 01:02:20.971
I could help as well.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.209
- Hm?
- Really?

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:29.346
I will pay you
for the goods.

01:02:29.379 --> 01:02:30.981
I know you will like it.

01:02:31.015 --> 01:02:34.051
Best thing you'll ever do.

01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:47.264
I know of a woman with some
incredible legends to tell.

01:02:54.138 --> 01:02:57.007
She lives in
the carpathian mountains.

01:02:57.041 --> 01:02:58.909
In a castle?

01:02:58.943 --> 01:03:01.245
No, no, in a house.

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:04.014
But apparently,
she's a crone.

01:03:04.048 --> 01:03:07.317
My God!
I have goose bumps.

01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:09.319
Can I interview her?

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:10.487
I think so.

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:16.260
I'll make it happen.

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:45.455
(Chuckles)

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:58.668
I wanted to let you know
that I'm going to transylvania.

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:03.874
Done deal.

01:04:03.908 --> 01:04:06.376
Well, you're not going alone.

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:10.180
I don't wanna force you.

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:13.383
Christian is on board.

01:04:13.417 --> 01:04:15.252
And I'm in.

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:18.055
Of course.

01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:21.125
Hey, we're in
this together.

01:04:21.158 --> 01:04:24.128
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:25.395
All right.

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:39.276
Yeah, wait...

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:42.546
Behind the orthodox church.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:44.114
Okay, cool.

01:04:44.148 --> 01:04:45.415
See you there.

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:46.516
Okay, bye.

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:49.553
Okay, do you know
where that is?

01:04:49.586 --> 01:04:51.388
Uh, that street to the left.

01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:53.123
Okay, let's go.

01:04:54.658 --> 01:04:58.462
So, we agreed
to 2,000 Euros.

01:05:00.164 --> 01:05:02.632
And you tell them
what you know,

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:06.136
or what you don't know.

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:07.371
Got it?

01:05:09.306 --> 01:05:10.440
2,000?

01:05:12.176 --> 01:05:14.644
My underwear
costs more than that.

01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:17.047
So, uh...

01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:20.017
Five grand or I walk.

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:23.453
Two grand and you talk.

01:05:23.487 --> 01:05:25.622
Oh, they're coming.

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:28.993
You always do this to me.

01:05:30.995 --> 01:05:32.662
- Hannah.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:05:32.696 --> 01:05:34.098
- Hey.
- Nate.

01:05:34.131 --> 01:05:35.565
- Nate, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:37.701
- Emmy.
- Hello.

01:05:37.734 --> 01:05:39.603
Gabriella.

01:05:41.638 --> 01:05:46.977
Well, here we are
in beautiful transylvania.

01:05:47.011 --> 01:05:48.645
Great place for an interview.

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:53.450
Gabby will tell you everything.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:00.124
I was walking by
the fortified reformed church

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:02.326
on Parker street
here in cluj

01:06:02.359 --> 01:06:05.129
when I saw that woman
covered in blood.

01:06:05.162 --> 01:06:07.998
Her hair, her clothes.

01:06:08.032 --> 01:06:10.200
She told me
that she was robbed,

01:06:10.234 --> 01:06:12.002
but I know
that she was bitten

01:06:12.036 --> 01:06:15.039
by somebody
or something.

01:06:15.072 --> 01:06:18.108
She gave off
a magical aura.

01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:20.044
What happened after?

01:06:20.077 --> 01:06:21.478
I wanted to take her
to the hospital

01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:23.213
but she wouldn't.

01:06:23.247 --> 01:06:27.084
She was talking about
signs and types on buildings.

01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:31.055
Such as the synagogue,
the center of our predators.

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:33.257
But there are those
signs that are bad luck.

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:34.724
She was pretty out of it.

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:36.326
I thought she was crazy,

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:41.565
but when we got
to king ferdinand street,

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:43.333
there it was.

01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:48.505
A sign painted on
the side of a building.

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:50.407
It was very big.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.243
So which building?

01:06:53.277 --> 01:06:54.511
The yellow one.

01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:58.215
What was the sign.

01:06:58.248 --> 01:06:59.649
A raven.

01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:03.019
She was talking about
the COD and the prince.

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:06.690
The prince?
The prince of...

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:09.059
Prince of transylvania.

01:07:09.093 --> 01:07:11.095
Reckless, evil doings.

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:15.099
Like what?

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:17.501
She said the new order
and New York.

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:31.715
So, guys,

01:07:31.748 --> 01:07:36.120
this is the place
what I wanted to show you,

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:39.489
the most important,
the most special because

01:07:39.523 --> 01:07:43.593
this is the place where
I saw her for the last time.

01:07:43.627 --> 01:07:46.363
You know what I mean?

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:47.531
Come on.

01:07:55.639 --> 01:07:57.107
Watch for the bats.

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:02.446
So...

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:04.214
What do you
think about it?

01:08:04.248 --> 01:08:06.616
- Is this is where you got her?
- Yeah.

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:09.686
She was up there.

01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:12.256
Yeah, you can take
some pictures.

01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:13.790
That's what I'm doing.

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:16.626
Oh, my God!

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.295
Oh, shit!

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:33.609
(Gasps)

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.715
(Groaning)

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:27.796
Stay behind me,
stay behind me.

01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:29.366
Shh, shh, shh.

01:09:30.634 --> 01:09:32.202
(Squeals)

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.606
Hey!

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.396
(Phone rings)

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:00.597
Hey.

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:02.399
Bit of a problem.

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:05.001
The asset is
in another city

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:07.971
in a town called sighisoara.

01:10:10.607 --> 01:10:12.442
Are you sure you
wanna do this?

01:10:12.476 --> 01:10:15.279
Yeah, it's worth it, yeah.

01:10:15.312 --> 01:10:17.947
Hell, yeah,
I wanna meet 'em.

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:20.817
I wanna interview
with the fucking guy.

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:23.487
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:29.593
Yeah, they're fine, yeah.

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:31.261
Meet you where?

01:10:34.298 --> 01:10:35.932
Okay, cool.
See you soon.

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:37.501
Thank you.

01:10:37.534 --> 01:10:39.469
Okay, see you there.

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:58.422
Everything that gives rise
to the telling of this story

01:10:58.455 --> 01:11:00.790
occurs in drakula's
transylvania

01:11:00.824 --> 01:11:02.025
where he was raised.

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.342
Uh, where is Christian?

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:21.345
He's in the old clocktower
near there.

01:11:21.378 --> 01:11:22.912
Oh, okay.

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:28.752
(Bell tolling)

01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:39.396
(Phone rings)

01:11:40.664 --> 01:11:41.665
Hey.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:44.734
Okay.

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.939
Call you back in five.

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:58.047
Along here I saw her walking
out from that building.

01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:00.083
Blooded.

01:12:00.116 --> 01:12:01.918
Blooded, blooded.

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:04.888
Along here,
I saw her blooded

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:06.956
walking out
from that building.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.360
And what happened?

01:12:10.394 --> 01:12:11.895
I wanted to help her,

01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:13.497
but she says I can't.

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:15.732
No one can, no one can.

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:17.967
That's sounds pretty good.

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:20.437
Add a bit of paprika to it,

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:24.874
little village story,
the carpathians.

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:27.777
Well, come on.

01:12:27.811 --> 01:12:30.614
You're the shaman,
for fuck sakes!

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:31.881
How much you want?

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:36.352
- 1,000 Euros.
- (Laughs)

01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:38.822
No.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:40.356
500.

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:43.359
I'll tell them the truth.

01:12:45.562 --> 01:12:47.397
Okay, okay, 500, 500.

01:12:47.431 --> 01:12:49.999
- (Phone chimes)
- 500.

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:55.939
Along here, I saw her...

01:12:55.972 --> 01:12:57.741
Hey, man!
You shut up.

01:12:57.774 --> 01:13:00.176
Speak only in
Romanian with them.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:01.711
Make it 1,000, man.

01:13:01.745 --> 01:13:04.914
You made a lot of money
on the African deal.

01:13:04.948 --> 01:13:09.619
You have to figure out how
to benefit from the new order.

01:13:09.653 --> 01:13:10.954
You'll be great.

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:13.957
(Speaking Romanian)

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:15.158
Love it.

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:25.101
10 g.

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:30.674
Let's do this?

01:13:30.707 --> 01:13:33.677
Let's do it.

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:36.480
So what can you tell us
about vlad the impaler?

01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:50.927
(Speaking Romanian)

01:13:53.897 --> 01:13:56.099
It's a high Mountain pass
and it's dangerous.

01:13:58.134 --> 01:14:01.104
What do you know about
the order of the dragon?

01:14:03.673 --> 01:14:05.809
(Speaking Romanian)

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:11.648
To defend the cross
and fight the turks.

01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:15.018
I know, but I heard
that the dragon society

01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:17.487
has members in this town

01:14:17.521 --> 01:14:19.856
operating today.

01:14:19.889 --> 01:14:21.758
I don't know any members.

01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:27.997
I'll give you 10,000 Euros

01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:30.734
if you show me a member
and their symbol.

01:14:30.767 --> 01:14:31.935
He doesn't know shit.

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.172
You can see them at night.

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:37.774
Where?

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:40.877
They use
the covered staircase

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:42.579
which leads up to the church

01:14:42.612 --> 01:14:44.180
on the hill.

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:45.749
It can be anyone.

01:14:45.782 --> 01:14:48.885
They have a place in covasna

01:14:48.918 --> 01:14:52.155
named after a very famous
mineral water.

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:54.958
Okay, I go.

01:14:58.094 --> 01:15:01.064
What the fuck?
He's full of shit!

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:04.668
You know the place.
I know you do.

01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:07.170
When you didn't drink
your mineral water in Paris.

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:09.272
First time we met,
you said something about

01:15:09.305 --> 01:15:11.140
water in Africa.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:14.177
What the fuck
is going on here?

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:18.782
I paid you 10 grand, man!
What the fuck is going on here?

01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:21.818
It's not that easy.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.087
It's dangerous.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.624
I don't have the location.

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:29.826
- He's the shaman.
- You fucking liar!

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:30.894
Come on.

01:15:32.696 --> 01:15:33.863
I paid you!

01:16:50.406 --> 01:16:51.941
(Growls)

01:16:55.244 --> 01:16:58.181
You fuck!

01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:00.183
(Screams)

01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:34.317
(Gasping)

01:17:46.796 --> 01:17:48.765
(Crying)

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:53.870
(Screaming in distance)

01:18:17.861 --> 01:18:20.229
(Sobbing)

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:27.003
I don't know what to do.

01:18:31.407 --> 01:18:33.242
We move on.

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.551
(Speaking Romanian)

01:20:55.318 --> 01:21:00.556
Can you tell us about
the symbol at the entrance?

01:21:00.589 --> 01:21:02.025
(Speaking Romanian)

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:12.936
They use the symbol
marking the path

01:21:12.969 --> 01:21:15.171
so people don't fall
into treachery.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:17.907
Oh, we want to be safe.

01:21:23.179 --> 01:21:25.949
Do you recognize her?

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:28.551
Please help me.
I've been abducted.

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:31.020
Do you recognize this place?

01:21:31.054 --> 01:21:32.021
I want blood.

01:21:32.055 --> 01:21:33.556
(Speaking Romanian)

01:21:36.525 --> 01:21:38.394
She was told
about veronique.

01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:43.432
Seen her in a house
with the symbol of a fish.

01:21:50.039 --> 01:21:51.507
It's not far.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.309
Walking distance
to the village across

01:21:53.342 --> 01:21:59.015
either side.

01:21:59.048 --> 01:22:02.986
The path is dangerous.
My way is safe.

01:22:03.019 --> 01:22:06.022
We only need an interview
with veronique.

01:22:06.055 --> 01:22:08.191
And the prince.

01:22:13.696 --> 01:22:17.200
Look for a house with
the symbol of a fish.

01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:54.537
(Phone rings)

01:22:56.339 --> 01:22:58.174
Emmy?

01:22:58.207 --> 01:23:01.177
Yeah.

01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:04.380
No.

01:23:04.413 --> 01:23:06.615
No, I don't see it.

01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:07.683
No, nothing.

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:10.253
Nothing?

01:23:10.286 --> 01:23:12.455
Well, okay, where?

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:14.390
Okay.

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:55.631
Hannah?

01:23:55.664 --> 01:23:56.532
Hannah?

01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:00.403
Emmy, meet me up the hill.

01:24:00.436 --> 01:24:01.704
Do you hear me?

01:24:01.737 --> 01:24:03.472
I...

01:25:45.274 --> 01:25:46.242
(Wind howls)

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:51.214
(Screams)

01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:16.919
(Gasping)

01:29:20.656 --> 01:29:23.125
(Heavy breathing)

01:29:42.778 --> 01:29:44.780
(Groans)

01:29:46.449 --> 01:29:47.650
(Gasps)

01:30:00.963 --> 01:30:03.432
(Gasps)

01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:10.739
(Whimpers)

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.794
(Phone rings)

01:32:17.833 --> 01:32:20.135
(Sniffing)

01:32:45.694 --> 01:32:47.696
(Panting)

01:33:20.796 --> 01:33:22.597
(Shrieks)

01:33:26.001 --> 01:33:27.335
Christian, stop!

01:33:27.369 --> 01:33:29.705
Stop, please, stop!

01:33:29.738 --> 01:33:32.007
Please! No!

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.076
(Shrieking)

01:34:03.806 --> 01:34:05.741
Why?

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:08.944
Why, Christian?

01:34:51.253 --> 01:34:53.421
(Laughs)
