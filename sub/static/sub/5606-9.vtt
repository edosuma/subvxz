<i>Previously on</i> Hawaii Five-O...
Who you working for, Hank?

00:04.538 --> 00:05.703
HANK:
<i> Gabriel Waincroft.</i>

00:05.705 --> 00:07.438
STEVE:
<i> You're gonna get in contact</i>

00:07.440 --> 00:09.339
with Gabriel, and you're gonna
tell him everything went down

00:09.341 --> 00:11.341
just as you planned it,
and if you do that,

00:11.343 --> 00:13.109
maybe you won't spend the rest
of your life in prison.

00:13.111 --> 00:15.344
Fair enough.

00:15.346 --> 00:17.379
What about the software that he
uploaded onto our mainframe?

00:17.381 --> 00:19.247
We're gonna use it
to catch Gabriel.

00:19.249 --> 00:21.315
Inspector Abby Dunn,
this is Chin Ho Kelly.

00:21.317 --> 00:23.450

00:26.021 --> 00:27.086
You know, I really
appreciate you jumping in

00:27.088 --> 00:28.253
with both feet on this one.

00:28.255 --> 00:29.520
I was hoping
this trip was gonna be more

00:29.522 --> 00:31.488
than just show and tell.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.656
Oh, yeah? Well, what
do you think so far?

00:33.658 --> 00:36.525
I like what I see.

00:37.594 --> 00:41.095
Crime lab restored over 24 hours
of deleted video footage

00:41.097 --> 00:42.529
of a potential murderer.

00:42.531 --> 00:45.498
(laughing):
Yeah, that was all me.

00:45.500 --> 00:46.632
I'm sorry. I'm just...

00:46.634 --> 00:48.667
This is Eric Russo.
He's our new lab tech.

00:48.669 --> 00:50.735
He's also Detective Williams'
nephew.

00:50.737 --> 00:52.269
Oh, cool.

00:58.677 --> 01:00.777
(grunting, bones snapping)

01:04.616 --> 01:05.681

01:05.683 --> 01:07.582
This doesn't
change anything.

01:07.584 --> 01:09.417
(grunts)

01:09.419 --> 01:10.584
Can I help you?

01:10.586 --> 01:12.552
Yeah, I'd like to
report two murders.

01:12.554 --> 01:15.655
<i> You can find the bodies in the</i>

01:15.657 --> 01:16.622
How do you know this?

01:16.624 --> 01:19.791
Because I put them there.

01:21.261 --> 01:23.294

01:27.499 --> 01:28.564

02:04.729 --> 02:07.596
Yo. Overslept. Sorry.

02:07.598 --> 02:09.798
My bad. Next time that
you're late for my class,

02:09.800 --> 02:11.800
please don't
bother showing up.

02:11.802 --> 02:13.334
Okay?

02:13.336 --> 02:15.135
Have a seat. Thanks.

02:15.137 --> 02:17.737
All right, uh, so
I understand, uh,

02:17.739 --> 02:19.672
you've been covering
monopoly markets.

02:19.674 --> 02:21.874
So if nobody has any questions...
WOMAN: I have a question.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.742
Yes? What happened
to Professor Thomas?

02:23.744 --> 02:25.610
Is he, like,

02:25.612 --> 02:27.712
not gonna come back?

02:29.315 --> 02:31.715
No, I-I don't think
he will be coming back.

02:31.717 --> 02:33.717

02:33.719 --> 02:35.719
What is that?

02:35.721 --> 02:37.654
What are you guys eating?

02:37.656 --> 02:39.589
What's got you all riled up?

02:39.591 --> 02:41.557

02:48.764 --> 02:50.630

03:53.751 --> 03:55.584

What happened to the plans?

03:55.586 --> 03:57.886
HPD sent this across
this morning.

03:59.756 --> 04:01.756
Oh.

04:01.758 --> 04:04.759
Is that Hank Weber?
He's looked better.

04:04.761 --> 04:06.293
Yeah, somebody stabbed him

04:06.295 --> 04:07.727
28 times in the yard
this morning.

04:07.729 --> 04:08.894
Well, this is obviously

04:08.896 --> 04:11.763
the work of Gabriel Waincroft.

04:11.765 --> 04:14.632
Maybe he found out that
Hank told us about the virus

04:14.634 --> 04:15.866
he put in
his computer.

04:15.868 --> 04:17.434
But how could he possibly
know that?

04:17.436 --> 04:18.635
Well, my friend,

04:18.637 --> 04:21.204
that is a mystery
that will only be solved

04:21.206 --> 04:24.574
when we lock up
Gabriel Waincroft.

04:24.576 --> 04:26.409
We just lost the best chance
we ever had of doing that.

04:26.411 --> 04:28.411
You see, this is
a chess game to him.

04:28.413 --> 04:29.745
He just sent us
a very clear message

04:29.747 --> 04:32.814

So, body's this way, at
least what's left of it.

05:37.335 --> 05:38.767
Kono, I'm surprised
to see you here.

05:38.769 --> 05:40.635
I thought you and Adam
had an appointment

05:40.637 --> 05:42.336
with the prosecuting
attorney's office?

05:42.338 --> 05:43.437
Yeah, we
already did.

05:43.439 --> 05:45.005
They offered him
a deal-- 24 months.

05:45.007 --> 05:47.874
24 months? Goro's men kidnapped
him and tried to kill him.

05:47.876 --> 05:49.342
It was self-defense.

05:49.344 --> 05:50.376
That's not how
the PA sees it.

05:50.378 --> 05:51.911
To them, it's an opportunity

05:51.912 --> 05:53.445
to lock up the son of a Yakuza
boss on a double homicide.

05:53.447 --> 05:55.013
Yeah, self-defense or not,
they can still charge him

05:55.015 --> 05:56.414
with criminal possession
of a weapon.

05:56.416 --> 05:58.783
Yeah, you know the
worst part about this?

05:58.785 --> 06:00.451
Adam doesn't even seem
interested in fighting this.

06:00.453 --> 06:03.353
And so, he's thinking
of taking the deal.

06:03.355 --> 06:05.021
STEVE:
Chin, what do we got?

06:05.023 --> 06:07.390
Ranch hand came out
to feed the pigs, but found

06:07.392 --> 06:08.724
that they had already eaten.

06:08.726 --> 06:10.358
Max is working on an ID now.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.476
STEVE:
All right,

06:11.477 --> 06:12.593
remote location,
middle of the night.

06:12.595 --> 06:13.860
This wasn't
an accident.

06:13.862 --> 06:15.595
Definitely a
body dump.

06:15.597 --> 06:18.397
This is an old
organized crime trick.

06:18.399 --> 06:20.432
Pigs-- they can eat
through bone. They don't

06:20.434 --> 06:21.900
leave anything behind.

06:21.902 --> 06:23.768
Hey, Max,
how's it going in there?

06:23.770 --> 06:26.804
Well, I'm still looking
for some identifying markers,

06:26.806 --> 06:28.372
such as teeth or fingers.

06:28.374 --> 06:30.407
But I can tell you
our victim is male,

06:30.409 --> 06:31.941
approximately mid
to late forties.

06:31.943 --> 06:34.343
Fortunately, his
liver's intact, so,

06:34.345 --> 06:35.877
temperature suggests
T.O.D. to be

06:35.879 --> 06:37.044
between 10:00 p.m. and midnight.

06:37.046 --> 06:38.512
DANNY:
Aha.

06:38.514 --> 06:40.547
Was he a hot
or a cold meal?

06:40.549 --> 06:43.082
Well, if you're asking
whether the corpse was consumed

06:43.084 --> 06:46.885
post or antemortem, I don't have
an answer to that yet.

06:46.887 --> 06:49.320
Although...

06:50.389 --> 06:52.389
Eureka!

06:52.391 --> 06:54.557
I found a thumb!

06:54.559 --> 06:56.058
Did he just say
"Eureka?" Yes, he did.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.926
STEVE: All right, Max, we're
gonna need to get that

06:57.928 --> 06:59.327
back to the
lab right away

06:59.329 --> 07:00.461
and run the print
though AFIS.

07:00.463 --> 07:01.929
Way ahead of you, Commander.

07:01.931 --> 07:03.664
(beeping)

07:03.666 --> 07:05.365
(trilling)

07:05.367 --> 07:06.532
Ah! And we have a hit!

07:06.534 --> 07:08.534
(camera shutter clicking)

07:08.536 --> 07:10.569
Our victim's name
is Elliot Thomas.

07:10.571 --> 07:13.038
Appears to be on faculty

07:13.040 --> 07:14.506
at Oahu State.

07:14.508 --> 07:16.374
STEVE:
Guy's got no record.

07:16.376 --> 07:17.575
Not even a parking ticket.

07:17.577 --> 07:19.009
DANNY:
All right, so,

07:19.011 --> 07:21.378
how does a solid citizen
end up pig food?

07:21.380 --> 07:23.079
(growling) KONO: I don't know.

07:23.081 --> 07:25.481
But I think
I'm done eating bacon.

07:33.591 --> 07:35.591
MAN:
<i> When I heard what happened,</i>

07:35.593 --> 07:36.725
I notified the
campus police.

07:36.726 --> 07:37.858
They discovered
Professor Thomas' car

07:37.861 --> 07:40.428
had been here overnight.

07:40.429 --> 07:42.996
They also found some of his
belongings on the ground.

07:42.999 --> 07:45.899
He was abducted right here.

07:45.901 --> 07:49.569
Yeah, I guess that makes this
our primary crime scene.

07:49.571 --> 07:51.571
Dean Letoa,
I don't see any cameras around.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.572
We're undergoing
facility improvements.

07:53.575 --> 07:55.474
We just installed cameras
in the student lots,

07:55.476 --> 07:58.376
but we haven't quite
got to the faculty yet.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.378
GROVER:
Well, we're gonna need

08:00.379 --> 08:02.379
to establish a timeline,
so, um, do you have any idea

08:02.382 --> 08:04.715
what the professor's schedule
was last night?

08:04.717 --> 08:08.151
I know he had a lecture
that ended at 8:00.

08:08.153 --> 08:09.552
Hey.

08:09.554 --> 08:12.154
Look at this.

08:12.156 --> 08:14.089
Touch-up paint.

08:14.091 --> 08:15.523
Somebody key his car?

08:15.525 --> 08:17.791
Yes, uh, that happened
here last month.

08:17.793 --> 08:19.492
Professor Thomas
filed a report.

08:19.494 --> 08:21.660
Was that an isolated incident,
or does he have

08:21.662 --> 08:24.095
some kind of beef going on
with somebody on campus?

08:24.097 --> 08:26.530
Unfortunately,
there a quite a few people

08:26.532 --> 08:29.933
who had<i> issues</i> with him.

08:29.935 --> 08:32.035
Oh.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.474
CHIN:
<i> Okay, so, this Web site</i>

08:38.476 --> 08:40.809
ranks professors based
on student reviews.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.478
Now, Professor Thomas' approval
ratings were in the tank.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.947
By far the lowest of any teacher
in the whole place.

08:45.949 --> 08:47.949
And check out some
of the comments.

08:47.951 --> 08:50.084
GROVER:
"This guy's not a professor.

08:50.086 --> 08:52.820
"He's a dictator,
and his class

08:52.822 --> 08:54.655
is like a prison camp." Damn.

08:54.657 --> 08:56.423
"Professor Thomas
makes the dude

08:56.425 --> 08:57.791
"from<i> Whiplash </i>
seem warm and fuzzy.

08:57.793 --> 08:59.926
And he doesn't play
cool jazz music."

08:59.928 --> 09:01.827
(chuckles) These are
some of the nicer ones.

09:01.829 --> 09:03.428
Check this one out.

09:03.430 --> 09:04.695
DANNY:
"Thomas sucks."

09:04.697 --> 09:06.697
I'm into the whole
brevity thing, you know.

09:06.699 --> 09:08.865
Okay, well, it's clear
his students hated him.

09:08.867 --> 09:10.700
And given he was
grabbed on campus,

09:10.702 --> 09:12.768
we need to consider all
of them as suspects, right?

09:12.770 --> 09:14.035
KONO:
Hey.

09:14.037 --> 09:16.437
So I just got off the phone
with Duke.

09:16.439 --> 09:18.138
Professor Thomas' house
was vandalized last week.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.540
Someone tossed a brick through
the window with a note attached.

09:20.542 --> 09:21.941
That's called
a Sicilian love letter.

09:21.943 --> 09:23.776
What did it say?
Said, "Do the world

09:23.778 --> 09:25.161
a favor and die."

09:25.162 --> 09:26.545
GROVER: Oh, that sounds
like that could be our guy.

09:26.547 --> 09:28.813
Maybe he fired a shot
across the old professor's bow

09:28.815 --> 09:30.948
before he got up close
and personal with him.

09:30.950 --> 09:32.933
Well, the lab was able to
pull a print off the note,

09:32.934 --> 09:34.917
but there was no match in AFIS.
CHIN: I don't suppose we can just

09:34.920 --> 09:37.120
head down to campus and
fingerprint all of his students?

09:37.122 --> 09:38.488
Maybe we can.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.306
How?

09:40.307 --> 09:42.123
Well, it seems to me that
there's now an opening for a new

09:42.126 --> 09:44.693
economics professor at OSU,
and it just so happens

09:44.695 --> 09:46.928
that one of our own
minored in business

09:46.930 --> 09:48.195
at Seton Hall.

09:48.197 --> 09:50.063
How could you possibly
know that?

09:50.065 --> 09:51.731
That's not even
in my personnel file.

09:51.733 --> 09:52.765
STEVE: You think I'm
gonna take you on

09:52.767 --> 09:54.666
to be my partner
this whole time

09:54.668 --> 09:56.218
without doing
my homework?

09:56.219 --> 09:57.769
KONO: Wait. Boss, you've
been sitting on that

09:57.771 --> 09:58.970
for six years?

09:58.972 --> 10:00.071
GROVER:
That means he's probably got

10:00.073 --> 10:01.238
something on all of us.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.606
Whatever.
Especially you.

10:02.608 --> 10:03.985
Let's stay on point.

10:03.986 --> 10:05.363
We need somebody
on the inside, somebody

10:05.364 --> 10:06.741
to get intel and prints.
Danny, you make

10:06.745 --> 10:07.989
the most sense.
No.

10:07.990 --> 10:09.234
What do you mean, "no?"
No! I'm not gonna do it.

10:09.235 --> 10:10.479
It's ridiculous, first of all.

10:10.482 --> 10:11.914
Second of all,
even if I did do it,

10:11.916 --> 10:14.816
uh, nobody's gonna buy me
as a stuffy economics professor.

10:14.818 --> 10:17.118
GROVER: Oh, no. I don't know.
Oh, you don't?

10:17.120 --> 10:19.587
I don't know. You got a
little, uh, quick temper,

10:19.589 --> 10:20.788
kind of curmudgeonly.

10:20.790 --> 10:22.956
Curmudgeonly.
(laughter)

10:22.958 --> 10:24.757
Yeah, and you have an
opinion about everything.

10:24.759 --> 10:26.658
You're the grumpiest person I know.
All right, good.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.092
All right, so let's say
that this stupid idea is

10:28.094 --> 10:30.027
something that we can do. Maybe
I can get prints, but intel?

10:30.029 --> 10:31.661
I'm not gonna be able...
These kids are not gonna

10:31.663 --> 10:34.664
open up to me. STEVE: He's right.
They're not.

10:34.666 --> 10:35.865
We need somebody else
in there with you,

10:35.866 --> 10:37.065
somebody
who these kids can relate to,

10:37.068 --> 10:39.234
who looks like 'em,
who acts like them.

10:39.236 --> 10:41.803
So let me get this straight.

10:41.805 --> 10:43.704
You want me to leave this lab

10:43.706 --> 10:45.138
to go undercover
as a college student

10:45.140 --> 10:47.006
at the biggest
party school in the state?

10:47.008 --> 10:49.008
Yes.

10:49.010 --> 10:52.277
It was his idea, not mine.

10:53.246 --> 10:55.613
All right.

10:55.615 --> 10:57.648
If I'm gonna sell this,
though, I got to go all in.

10:57.650 --> 11:00.517

You look totally different,

11:43.119 --> 11:44.718
That's a great disguise.
Yeah?

11:44.720 --> 11:46.119
Thank you.
You, too, with the, uh,

11:46.121 --> 11:48.788
college idiot persona.
You are a natural.

11:48.790 --> 11:50.122
Okay, so,

11:50.124 --> 11:52.657
we're gonna have eyes and ears
on you at all times.

11:52.659 --> 11:55.726
Right.
So, hypothetically speaking,

11:55.728 --> 11:57.561
if I were to find myself
in a compromising position

11:57.563 --> 11:58.829
with one of these coeds

11:58.830 --> 12:00.096
and maintaining my cover
requires me

12:00.098 --> 12:01.997
to satisfy her sexually,

12:01.999 --> 12:03.198
that's cool,
right?

12:03.200 --> 12:04.732
This has "epic fail"
written all over it.

12:04.734 --> 12:06.834
You know that, right?
Okay, Eric,

12:06.836 --> 12:08.869
you need to focus
on memorizing

12:08.871 --> 12:10.704
the names and faces
of these students.

12:10.706 --> 12:12.639
Okay, you're gonna have
to get in with these kids,

12:12.641 --> 12:14.641
you know, embed
yourself, and find out

12:14.643 --> 12:16.142
who may have had it in
for Professor Thomas.

12:16.144 --> 12:18.844
I can foc... Holy smoke show.

12:18.846 --> 12:20.679
Check it out, Uncle D.

12:20.681 --> 12:22.214
That girl's
a legit ten.

12:22.215 --> 12:23.748
Hell, if we were back in Jersey,
she'd be a 12.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.383
I'm gonna be real honest here,
if she killed

12:25.384 --> 12:27.017
the professor, I wouldn't care.
I'd still marry her.

12:27.019 --> 12:28.985
Can I smack him? Do me a
favor, please, just try

12:28.987 --> 12:30.219
and act professional.
That's all. Okay.

12:30.221 --> 12:31.753
Guys, chillax, all right?

12:31.755 --> 12:33.688
I'm just getting into character.

12:33.690 --> 12:35.690
Mrs. Tiffany Russo.

12:35.692 --> 12:37.291
It's got a nice ring to it
though, don't it?

12:37.293 --> 12:38.859
Oh, boy.

12:39.828 --> 12:41.694
All right, uh,
so I understand, uh,

12:41.696 --> 12:43.862
you've been covering
monopoly markets.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.864
So if nobody has any questions...
I have a question.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.199
Yes. What happened
to Professor Thomas?

12:48.201 --> 12:51.202
Is he, like,
not gonna come back?

12:51.204 --> 12:53.971
No, I-I don't think
he will be coming back.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.739
(gasping, laughter, chatter)

12:55.741 --> 12:57.707
ERIC:
Oh, hey.

12:57.709 --> 13:00.743
Awesome news.

13:00.745 --> 13:02.745
Okay.
Uh, look,

13:02.747 --> 13:04.279
I need to gauge
where you people are.

13:04.281 --> 13:06.080
So there's gonna be a-a pop quiz

13:06.082 --> 13:08.382
right now. Yeah, I know. It's terrible.
(groaning)

13:08.384 --> 13:10.183
But the good news is...
Here, look, there's good news.

13:10.185 --> 13:11.250
When you're done
with the test,

13:11.252 --> 13:13.252
you can go directly
to your homes

13:13.254 --> 13:15.387
or wherever it is
that you choose to go.

13:15.389 --> 13:17.722
Just, uh, please hand
the test to me, okay?

13:17.724 --> 13:20.257
Yeah? Right when you finish.
I'll be right there waiting.

13:20.259 --> 13:23.326
Okay? It's gonna
be fun, everybody.

13:24.862 --> 13:27.729
(waves crashing)

13:35.405 --> 13:37.671
Hey.

13:39.741 --> 13:41.807
How you
doing?

13:45.646 --> 13:48.780
Kamekona said
you had a visitor yesterday.

13:48.782 --> 13:50.148
Then I guess he told you
about my father.

13:50.150 --> 13:51.983
You want to talk about it?

13:51.985 --> 13:54.752
There's not much

13:54.754 --> 13:56.353
to say.

14:03.661 --> 14:04.860
He wants custody?

14:04.862 --> 14:07.128
I haven't seen him
since I was eight.

14:07.130 --> 14:09.730
He thinks 'cause he writes
a couple of letters from prison

14:09.732 --> 14:12.265
and says he's sorry
that still makes him my father.

14:12.267 --> 14:15.735
And now I got to live
with this guy.

14:15.737 --> 14:17.670
This is a court hearing.
You know that, right?

14:17.672 --> 14:19.338
Nothing's been decided yet.

14:19.339 --> 14:21.005
I'd rather be back
on the streets than be with him.

14:24.111 --> 14:26.177
No chance he's changed?

14:28.681 --> 14:30.280
No.

14:35.286 --> 14:37.252
Thank you,

14:37.254 --> 14:39.254
Mr. Tucker.

14:39.256 --> 14:42.323
Thank you,
Ms. Reese.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.126
Thank you, Ms. Le-her?

14:46.128 --> 14:47.894
Ler-er? Lehrer. That's nice.
Lehrer.

14:47.896 --> 14:51.130
What is that, French?
So, will you  be keeping

14:51.132 --> 14:52.931
the same office hours
as Professor Thomas?

14:52.933 --> 14:54.332
'Cause...

14:54.334 --> 14:56.267
I could really use
some extra help.

14:56.269 --> 14:58.902
You know, one-on-one?

14:58.904 --> 15:01.771
Right. Well, look,
if you have any, um,

15:01.773 --> 15:03.839
questions that, uh,
pertain to the...

15:03.841 --> 15:06.141
the material, the-the work stuff
that we're doing,

15:06.143 --> 15:08.209
then you... my door's open.
(chuckles)

15:08.211 --> 15:10.844
Okay. Totally get
what you're saying.

15:10.846 --> 15:13.012
ERIC:
All right.

15:13.014 --> 15:15.280
Later, blood.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.252
Dude, I may have
bombed this quiz,

15:21.254 --> 15:23.387
but I am straight-up murdering
this undercover thing.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.722
Bad choice of words. But I'm
already piped into the scene.

15:25.724 --> 15:27.190
I got so much stuff
going on. I got

15:27.192 --> 15:29.392
coffee with Sienna, Ultimate
Frisbee in the quad, study group

15:29.394 --> 15:31.518
tonight, kegger after that.
Okay, all right.

15:31.544 --> 15:32.395
Slow down, please.

15:32.397 --> 15:34.063
Don't be too eager.
If you're too eager,

15:34.065 --> 15:36.065
it's gonna be suspicious,
you understand?

15:36.067 --> 15:38.267
Copy that. Maybe
I'll blow off Good.

15:38.269 --> 15:40.135
study group, see if I
can track down Tiffany.

15:40.137 --> 15:41.870
The, uh...
the Jersey 12?

15:41.872 --> 15:43.872
That's stalking. Don't stalk,
'cause that's illegal.

15:43.874 --> 15:46.140
Hey, hey, hey. You did not see
the look she gave me, all right?

15:46.142 --> 15:47.341
We have something
real going on here.

15:47.343 --> 15:48.875
Uh-huh.
All right, look,

15:48.877 --> 15:50.743
Jump Street, do me a favor,
all right?

15:50.745 --> 15:52.745
I-I can't believe that
I'm actually gonna say this,

15:52.747 --> 15:55.914
but your priority needs
to be that keg party tonight,

15:55.916 --> 15:57.982
okay? It's a high concentration
of students.

15:57.984 --> 15:59.984
Blood alcohol level is up,
guard is down.

15:59.986 --> 16:02.152
You dig? Got it.
Get 'em plastered,

16:02.154 --> 16:03.419
make 'em spill on
Professor Thomas.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.087
That's right. Oh, um,

16:05.089 --> 16:08.090
Dean Letoa is, uh, about to call
an assembly for, uh,

16:08.092 --> 16:10.425
Professor Thomas' students, to
tell 'em that he has passed on.

16:10.427 --> 16:12.026
I want you to be there,
observe and report.

16:12.028 --> 16:12.526
Will do.

16:12.528 --> 16:13.326
Okay, good.

16:13.328 --> 16:14.994
Hey, by the way,
Yeah.

16:14.996 --> 16:16.095
great class.

16:16.097 --> 16:17.029
Thank you.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.174
MAX:
<i> Inspector Dunn, I apologize</i>

16:30.176 --> 16:32.009
we weren't properly introduced
at the crime scene.

16:32.011 --> 16:35.345
No worries. You were elbow-deep
in human entrails. I get it.

16:35.347 --> 16:37.947
Speaking of which,
I was able to assemble

16:37.949 --> 16:40.149
what's left
of your victim.

16:42.019 --> 16:45.387
After cleaning off
the remains, I was able

16:45.389 --> 16:48.390
to discover
a single GSW to the chest.

16:48.392 --> 16:50.959
Unfortunately, I couldn't find
any exit wound,

16:50.961 --> 16:54.829
but, based on the trajectory,
I would assume Professor Thomas

16:54.831 --> 16:56.497
was shot in the heart.
Unfortunately,

16:56.499 --> 16:57.998
the heart was eaten.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.466
So you're saying the pigs...

16:59.468 --> 17:01.301
the pigs ate the bullet?

17:01.303 --> 17:03.903
Correct. Now, thankfully,
after digestion,

17:03.905 --> 17:05.905
we will be able
to excavate the evidence.

17:05.907 --> 17:07.907
So we have to wait
for the pigs to...

17:07.909 --> 17:09.208
poop the slug?

17:09.210 --> 17:11.210
Yes. And you will have
to monitor them closely,

17:11.212 --> 17:13.028
because, given the opportunity,

17:13.029 --> 17:14.845
swines will consume
their own excrement.

17:14.848 --> 17:17.248
Oh. Ugh, I'm glad
I'm a vegetarian.

17:17.250 --> 17:19.583
Okay. Well,
I can tell you right now

17:19.585 --> 17:21.585
that we won't be babysitting
the pigs.

17:21.587 --> 17:24.454
Jerry, hey. What are you doing?

17:24.456 --> 17:27.356
Hey, sorry, Jer, I know
it's not the most glamorous gig.

17:27.358 --> 17:28.841
Are you kidding me?

17:28.842 --> 17:30.325
I'm searching
for the magic bullet.

17:30.327 --> 17:32.327
You guys trust me.
This is real cop work.

17:32.329 --> 17:35.330
All right, well, remember,
when the bullet comes out...

17:35.332 --> 17:36.597
I know.

17:36.599 --> 17:39.299
Don't touch it. Call CSU.
Got it.

17:39.301 --> 17:41.834
Good luck.

17:41.836 --> 17:43.902
(pigs snorting)

17:57.316 --> 17:59.182
(chuckles)

17:59.184 --> 18:00.483
What?

18:00.485 --> 18:03.486
Nothing. It's just...

18:03.488 --> 18:06.255
You know the last time
somebody opened a door for me?

18:06.257 --> 18:09.391
It was... never.

18:09.393 --> 18:10.392
Oh, come on. Not even on a date?

18:10.394 --> 18:12.427
No.

18:12.429 --> 18:15.096
All right, well, I guess I was
just raised to be a gentleman.

18:15.098 --> 18:17.098
Yeah. It's a good thing.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.166
One of the things
I always admired about my dad

18:19.168 --> 18:20.901
was his sense of chivalry.

18:20.902 --> 18:22.635
I thought that had died out
with his generation.

18:22.638 --> 18:24.571
It's nice to see I was wrong.

18:31.446 --> 18:33.045
(phone rings)

18:33.047 --> 18:34.546
Hey, Danny. What's up?

18:34.548 --> 18:36.614
Hey. Where are you on the prints
that I sent over?

18:36.616 --> 18:39.183
Hmm, we're about halfway done.
Okay, do me a favor.

18:39.185 --> 18:41.618
Uh, pull up Brandon Aquino. Run
him next if you haven't already.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.886
Run Brandon Aquino right away.

18:43.888 --> 18:45.287
Eric just called.

18:45.289 --> 18:47.088
Apparently he ran out of
the assembly the second he heard

18:47.090 --> 18:49.356
that Professor Thomas was murdered, so...
Who is this kid?

18:49.358 --> 18:52.158
Starting point guard
for the basketball team, who was

18:52.160 --> 18:53.459
failing Professor Thomas' class,

18:53.461 --> 18:55.461
which makes him ineligible.

18:55.463 --> 18:58.430
Well, there's a motive.
(beeping)

18:58.432 --> 19:00.398
Yeah, we got a match.
He's our guy.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.665
Where is he now?

19:01.667 --> 19:04.401
Yo.

19:04.403 --> 19:06.236
He's, uh, in there with the coach.
AQUINO: What did you do?

19:06.238 --> 19:08.104
Sounds pretty ugly. I don't
know what you're talking about!

19:08.106 --> 19:09.405
You need to calm down!

19:09.407 --> 19:10.906
Calm down? STEVE: Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

19:10.908 --> 19:12.407
Both of you, shut your mouth!
Hey!

19:12.409 --> 19:14.175
Brandon Aquino,
we need

19:14.177 --> 19:16.277
to talk to you about the murder
of Professor Thomas.

19:16.279 --> 19:17.945
Whoa, you got the wrong
guy. Coach did it.

19:17.947 --> 19:19.012
He killed

19:19.014 --> 19:20.646
Professor
Thomas!

19:27.087 --> 19:28.986
STEVE:
<i> You threw a brick</i>

19:28.988 --> 19:30.220
through the professor's window.
It had a note on it

19:30.222 --> 19:32.322
with your prints
all over the note.

19:32.324 --> 19:34.023
You wanted him dead.
Now he's dead.

19:34.025 --> 19:36.325
I threw the brick. I was pissed.

19:36.327 --> 19:37.693
I worked my ass off
in that class,

19:37.695 --> 19:40.162
and no matter what I did,
it wasn't good enough.

19:40.164 --> 19:42.330
But I wouldn't kill him.

19:42.332 --> 19:44.598
That's a hell of an accusation
to have thrown at you, Coach.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.367
Why would I kill Professor Thomas?
AQUINO:<i> Coach Diggs</i>

19:47.369 --> 19:49.102
blew up when he found out
I was failing.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.037
He based his whole team
around me.

19:51.039 --> 19:53.039
We haven't won a championship
in over 30 years,

19:53.041 --> 19:55.041
and this season was
our best shot.

19:55.043 --> 19:57.076
He said not
to worry

19:57.077 --> 19:59.110
about it and he'd take care of it.
DIGGS:<i> I went to ask him</i>

19:59.113 --> 20:00.679
to cut Brandon some slack.

20:00.681 --> 20:03.081
But he wasn't interested
in having that conversation.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.083
I bet that pissed you off.

20:05.085 --> 20:07.085
Yeah. It did.

20:07.087 --> 20:09.487
So I talked
to the board of trustees,

20:09.489 --> 20:11.355
made them see the big picture:

20:11.357 --> 20:12.723
with Thomas
gone,

20:12.725 --> 20:14.091
Brandon can play.

20:14.093 --> 20:16.359
If Brandon plays, the team wins

20:16.361 --> 20:18.527
and so does the whole school.

20:20.097 --> 20:22.097
So you had him fired.

20:22.099 --> 20:25.233
It was supposed to be
his last semester.

20:25.235 --> 20:26.567
So you see?

20:26.569 --> 20:28.101
The guy was out.

20:28.103 --> 20:30.670
I had no reason to kill him.

20:32.407 --> 20:36.108
I am just so broken up about it,
Professor Jeffries.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.742
Oh. Ben.

20:37.744 --> 20:39.710
I mean,
I can call you that, right?

20:39.712 --> 20:41.578
No. I mean, life is
just so fleeting.

20:41.580 --> 20:45.615
You really have to make the most
of every opportunity.

20:45.617 --> 20:47.116
Yeah. That's, uh...
that's true.

20:47.118 --> 20:49.118
It's a very
interesting thought

20:49.120 --> 20:51.453
and probably something...
All this you should discuss

20:51.455 --> 20:53.455
with your grief counselor.
Yeah, but,

20:53.457 --> 20:58.526
I mean, you seem...
so approachable.

Maybe you're not
looking hard enough.

28:32.685 --> 28:34.985
So what, you just
show up to class

28:34.987 --> 28:36.419
whenever you want?

28:36.421 --> 28:40.021
Uh... or when I got a reason to.

28:42.425 --> 28:43.690
(chuckles)
Uh...

28:43.692 --> 28:45.658
pretty awful about
that professor, huh?

28:45.660 --> 28:48.761
No. Thank God he died.

28:48.763 --> 28:51.130
Whoa, that's a little harsh.

28:51.132 --> 28:53.132
You're right. I do
feel bad for the guy,

28:53.134 --> 28:56.468
but at least we got a shot
at passing his class now.

28:56.470 --> 28:57.702
(chuckles)

28:57.704 --> 29:00.004
Yeah, yeah.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.572
Have you seen

29:01.574 --> 29:03.090
Professor Jeffries?

29:03.091 --> 29:04.607
Adding him to my to-do list.

29:04.610 --> 29:07.077
(coughs) What, are you kidding me?
The guy's so old

29:07.079 --> 29:09.145
he went to Bon Jovi's
first concert back in '84.

29:09.147 --> 29:11.447
Okay, how would you
even know that?

29:12.583 --> 29:13.915
Facebook-stalked him.

29:13.917 --> 29:16.016
(phone rings)

29:19.054 --> 29:20.553
Go for E.

29:20.555 --> 29:22.054
DANNY:
Hey, can you talk?

29:22.056 --> 29:24.856
Oh, yeah, Ma.

29:24.858 --> 29:27.825
She-she worries about me.

29:27.827 --> 29:30.694
(all whooping, cheering)

29:33.699 --> 29:34.898
Okay, what's up?

29:34.900 --> 29:36.432
I'm sending you
a photo right now.

29:36.434 --> 29:38.100
Let me know you got it.

29:40.637 --> 29:41.936
Got it.

29:41.938 --> 29:43.871
Good. You recognize that kid?

29:43.873 --> 29:45.606
Sure, yeah,
that's One Buck Tuck.

29:45.608 --> 29:47.074
What does that mean?
What's One Buck Tuck?

29:47.076 --> 29:48.742
Well, his last name's Tucker.
He sells one blunt

29:48.744 --> 29:50.910
for one dollar during happy
hour, ergo One Buck Tuck.

29:50.912 --> 29:53.078
He's the pot dealer on campus.
Why, you think this is our guy?

29:53.080 --> 29:56.081
Maybe. Uh, apparently
he and Thomas were partners,

29:56.083 --> 29:59.017
uh, and they had a-a nail salon
that they were using as a front

29:59.019 --> 30:00.685
to launder money.
Now I have an idea

30:00.687 --> 30:02.086
where the money was coming from.

30:02.088 --> 30:04.154
So maybe the professor's murder
didn't have to do

30:04.156 --> 30:05.788
with him being a hard-ass
to his students?

30:05.790 --> 30:07.490
Maybe not.

30:07.491 --> 30:09.191
Maybe this was just
a disagreement between partners.

30:09.193 --> 30:11.593
Right.

30:16.766 --> 30:18.098
(knocking)

30:18.100 --> 30:19.699
If you're looking for Tuck,
he's not here.

30:19.701 --> 30:23.069
Just come back for your
medicinal needs later.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.904
(loud bang)

30:27.642 --> 30:29.008
I heard him say
to come in right in.

30:29.010 --> 30:30.876
I heard him say it, too.

30:30.878 --> 30:32.110
Where is he?

30:32.112 --> 30:33.611
I don't know. I just

30:33.613 --> 30:36.213
got back and
he wasn't here.

30:36.215 --> 30:38.648
I'm gonna search
all his stuff now.

30:38.650 --> 30:40.483
You got a problem with that?
No.

30:40.485 --> 30:43.919
Uh, go right ahead, I, actually,
uh, I have to go study.

30:44.855 --> 30:47.088
You got to study?

30:47.090 --> 30:50.024
(laughing)

30:50.026 --> 30:51.225
Anxious little dude.

30:53.729 --> 30:55.628
Ah, college dorm life:

30:55.630 --> 30:57.963
where personal hygiene

30:57.965 --> 31:00.532
and ramen noodles go to die.

31:05.004 --> 31:06.470
STEVE:
Yo.

31:06.472 --> 31:08.772
Look at that.

31:08.774 --> 31:11.107
An old, worn-out poster
stuck to the ceiling.

31:11.109 --> 31:12.741
That's not weird.

31:26.856 --> 31:28.956
Got 20 pounds
of weed up here.

31:28.958 --> 31:29.990
That's...

31:29.992 --> 31:31.725
that's a lot of smoke.

31:31.727 --> 31:35.061
Yeah, there's
something else, too

31:35.063 --> 31:38.697
Oh, grow lamp.

31:38.699 --> 31:40.899
Looks like Alfie and the
professor weren't just selling.

31:40.901 --> 31:44.869
You know, if there really is
20 pounds of weed up there,

31:44.871 --> 31:46.770
you know how many plants
that would take?  Yeah.

31:46.772 --> 31:49.239
Like a hundred.
And a big space.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.741
A lot of power. That's
well-hidden, right?

31:51.743 --> 31:52.908
Yeah.

31:52.910 --> 31:56.177
I think I know
where the place is.

31:59.916 --> 32:01.982
(clattering)

32:16.931 --> 32:18.997
Alfie, Alfie, Alfie!
Don't do it.

32:18.999 --> 32:20.865
Close the
lighter.

32:20.867 --> 32:22.066
Put the lighter
back in your pocket.

32:22.068 --> 32:25.235
Turn around.

32:25.237 --> 32:27.537
Get on your knees, put your
hands behind your head.

32:27.539 --> 32:29.605
Hands behind your head.

32:35.112 --> 32:37.178
<i> (buzzing, door unlocks)</i>

32:37.180 --> 32:39.246
(door opens, closes)

32:45.787 --> 32:47.086
Professor Jeffries?

32:47.088 --> 32:49.254
No, I am
Detective Williams.

32:49.256 --> 32:51.189
So you're not
really a teacher?

32:52.325 --> 32:53.957
No, I'm-I'm not

32:53.959 --> 32:55.558
really a teacher.
I definitely was not this stupid

32:55.560 --> 32:57.760
when I was in college.
Yeah, Don't Do Drugs

32:57.762 --> 32:58.961
just got a new mascot.

32:58.963 --> 33:00.062
Hey, that weed wasn't mine.

33:00.064 --> 33:02.064
I was just burning it
for a friend.

33:02.066 --> 33:03.932
Okay, first of all,
I don't believe that.

33:03.934 --> 33:07.768
But more importantly, we do not
care about the weed, okay?

33:08.737 --> 33:10.737
You don't?
No.

33:10.739 --> 33:11.938
We don't.
We just want to know

33:11.940 --> 33:14.006
why is it that
you killed your partner.

33:14.008 --> 33:15.340
What?!

33:15.342 --> 33:17.275
You mean Professor Thomas?

33:17.277 --> 33:19.710
No way. I had nothing
to do with that.

33:19.712 --> 33:21.812
Well, then why were you
trying to burn your crop?

33:21.814 --> 33:23.647
Because I didn't want
to be next.

33:23.649 --> 33:25.649
Next for what?
What do you mean?

33:27.085 --> 33:30.653
Look... all I wanted to do
was sell to my friends.

33:30.655 --> 33:32.855
It was never really
about money with me.

33:32.857 --> 33:35.958
But I was an idiot.
Did a handoff

33:35.960 --> 33:38.293
in the parking lot one day
and Professor Thomas saw me.

33:38.295 --> 33:41.963
I was pretty sure
he was gonna have me expelled.

33:41.965 --> 33:44.231
But he had this big idea.

33:44.233 --> 33:46.166
He said
I wasn't taking advantage

33:46.168 --> 33:47.867
of my position
in the marketplace,

33:47.869 --> 33:49.869
that he could help me
double my cash flow.

33:49.871 --> 33:52.204
So what, he was, uh,
he was, like, your advisor?

33:52.206 --> 33:54.005
More like business partner.

33:54.007 --> 33:56.741
Professor Thomas knew
he was getting fired.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.375
He said he never wanted
to teach again,

33:58.377 --> 33:59.876
that this could be
his retirement.

33:59.878 --> 34:02.378
So he helped me
expand the business.

34:03.848 --> 34:07.616
And that didn't go over so well
with some of our competitors.

34:07.618 --> 34:10.051
Okay, if you are saying
that one of them

34:10.053 --> 34:12.686
potentially killed him,
we need a name.

34:13.655 --> 34:15.187
Not happening.

34:15.189 --> 34:17.889
I'm not gonna end up
like Professor Thomas.

34:17.891 --> 34:19.290
You think burning
your inventory's

34:19.291 --> 34:20.690
gonna prove you're
out of the game?

34:20.693 --> 34:22.859
Because the people
we're talking about,

34:22.861 --> 34:25.928
they're gonna make sure you
never grow anything ever again.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.631
They're gonna
kill you.

34:31.368 --> 34:34.068
If I give you a name...

34:34.070 --> 34:36.736
you have to protect me.

34:38.906 --> 34:40.906
Sit down! Sit down!

34:40.908 --> 34:43.108
Have a seat!

34:46.079 --> 34:48.746
I never met no
Professor Thomas.

34:48.748 --> 34:51.315
Or this Alfie. What kind
of name is that, anyways?

34:51.317 --> 34:52.749
Sounds like a
couple of<i> haoles.</i>

34:52.751 --> 34:53.983
Yeah, it was
a couple of<i> haoles.</i>

34:53.985 --> 34:54.917
Now there's
only one<i> haole,</i>

34:54.919 --> 34:56.218
'cause you killed the other one.

34:56.220 --> 34:57.886
Why would I do that?
Because they started

34:57.888 --> 35:00.054
growing their own product,
and it was your territory--

35:00.056 --> 35:01.822
you couldn't have that, right?

35:01.824 --> 35:03.957
Grow? You talkin'
<i> pakalolo?</i>

35:03.959 --> 35:06.059
Braddah,
kush is about to be legal.

35:06.061 --> 35:09.328
Why waste time with that when
this whole island's a garden?

35:14.000 --> 35:15.165
(door buzzes)

35:15.167 --> 35:17.267
DANNY: Hey.
Hey. How'd it go in there?

35:17.269 --> 35:21.104
He denied all knowledge
of Alfie and the professor.

35:21.106 --> 35:22.872
His crew said the same thing.

35:22.874 --> 35:24.773
HPD did a sweep of their hang.

35:24.775 --> 35:27.008
Found a few weapons,
but no drugs.

35:27.010 --> 35:28.976
What?
I believe him.

35:28.978 --> 35:31.078
I'm just saying, it's
my gut-- I don't think

35:31.080 --> 35:32.846
he had anything to do
with this murder.

35:32.848 --> 35:34.914
Hey, so that was Chin.

35:34.916 --> 35:37.283
Ballistics came back on the
slug that Jerry recovered.

35:37.285 --> 35:39.184
Got a hit back
to a Beretta nine-millimeter

35:39.186 --> 35:41.953
registered to the Honolulu
Firearms & Range on Queen.

35:41.955 --> 35:44.822
Hmm.
Let's go.

35:46.725 --> 35:49.125
There's no way.
It's been here the whole time.

35:49.127 --> 35:50.359
Oh, it has, has it?
Yes.

35:50.361 --> 35:52.027
We're gonna need to see
a record of anybody

35:52.029 --> 35:54.095
who has used it in the last 48 hours.
I'll go

35:54.097 --> 35:55.996
print you a list right now.
Great. Off you go. Thanks.

35:55.998 --> 35:58.798
Actually, we're gonna hang on
to that for a minute.

36:01.936 --> 36:04.102
Hey, uh, Steve.

36:04.104 --> 36:06.170
Anybody look
familiar up there?

36:09.808 --> 36:11.774
ALFIE:
<i> You mean Professor Thomas?</i>

36:11.776 --> 36:13.709
No way. I had nothing
to do with that.

36:22.952 --> 36:24.251
DANNY:
<i> All right, so...</i>

36:24.253 --> 36:26.786
this is obviously you
right there, you see?

36:26.788 --> 36:28.120
And then that little nubby thing
right there,

36:28.122 --> 36:29.921
that is
a nine-millimeter Beretta.

36:29.923 --> 36:31.822
So what?

36:31.824 --> 36:33.324
So what?

36:33.325 --> 36:34.825
I shoot that gun at
the range all the time.

36:34.827 --> 36:36.793
Took it home by accident;
I returned it the next morning.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.995
That doesn't prove
I killed the professor.

36:38.997 --> 36:40.896
Actually, Alfie,
you're wrong.

36:40.898 --> 36:43.965
Ballistics proves that that gun was
the gun that killed the professor.

36:43.967 --> 36:46.200
And T.O.D.--
that's "time of death"--

36:46.202 --> 36:48.001
matches exactly
the window

36:48.003 --> 36:50.870
where you accidentally
borrowed it.

36:50.872 --> 36:53.038
DANNY: I like how you
used the gun range

36:53.040 --> 36:54.272
as a library.

36:54.274 --> 36:56.073
That's nice--
you take the murder weapon out,

36:56.075 --> 36:58.008
you return it the next day.
That's good.

36:58.010 --> 36:59.776
You know, I seem to
remember you saying

36:59.778 --> 37:01.744
this was never about the money.
My guess is,

37:01.746 --> 37:03.846
once you tasted
some real cash...

37:03.848 --> 37:06.014
you changed your view
on that, right?

37:06.016 --> 37:08.216
All of a sudden
the idea of splitting

37:08.218 --> 37:10.851
the take 50-50
wasn't so appealing.

37:10.853 --> 37:13.186
You're a smart kid, Alfie.

37:13.188 --> 37:15.388
I see what
the professor saw in you,

37:15.390 --> 37:16.956
but you made a mistake--

37:16.958 --> 37:18.857
you left out
one small detail.

37:20.794 --> 37:23.194
Pigs can't digest metal.

37:23.196 --> 37:25.929
Or, in this case,
lead bullets.

37:28.199 --> 37:30.933
ERIC: What do you
mean Alfie confessed?

37:30.935 --> 37:32.434
DANNY:
It means that

37:32.436 --> 37:34.903
he, uh, admitted to it,
he said, "I did it," okay?

37:34.905 --> 37:36.037
He confessed.

37:36.039 --> 37:37.538
And that's it?
I mean, you believe him?

37:37.540 --> 37:38.906
He's lied to you
about everything

37:38.908 --> 37:40.274
and now you trust him?
Okay, listen,

37:40.276 --> 37:42.142
I apologize,
but the fun is over, okay?

37:42.144 --> 37:43.776
The case is closed.
That's that.

37:43.778 --> 37:45.444
No, Uncle D, you're killing me!

37:45.446 --> 37:46.912
Call me Uncle D one more time

37:46.914 --> 37:48.914
and see what happens, okay?

37:48.916 --> 37:50.448
Sorry. I'm an idiot.

37:50.450 --> 37:52.283
Yes, you-you are an idiot.

you did a very good job.

Wow. Compliment? Thanks.
