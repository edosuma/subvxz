WEBVTT

00:09.509 --> 00:10.941
<i>I got Redis, son.</i>

00:10.972 --> 00:12.788
<i>Two for one,
two for one.</i>

00:12.803 --> 00:14.619
Got that Rasheed and Beno.

00:15.345 --> 00:16.393
Rasheed and Beno.

00:16.554 --> 00:17.993
Put some ice on his nuts.

00:18.383 --> 00:21.170
Tried and true, that shit
always bring a nigger back.

00:21.561 --> 00:23.500
Where we gonna
get ice from down here ?

00:24.516 --> 00:25.820
Walk him up to bon secours.

00:25.867 --> 00:27.916
Rasheed and Beno, Rasheed and Ben.

00:33.141 --> 00:34.440
Can we have an eight-ball ?

00:34.824 --> 00:35.637
An eight-ball  ?

00:38.078 --> 00:39.299
So, how you doin' today ?

00:39.830 --> 00:42.144
No offense, but could we
just get the eight-ball ?

00:42.787 --> 00:44.304
A-ight, a-ight, just bein' social.

00:44.465 --> 00:45.968
<i>Got it right here, yo.</i>

00:48.861 --> 00:49.518
Thank you.

00:50.019 --> 00:52.992
Yo, y'all hear about Mack Man jewelers
got took off las' night ?

00:54.893 --> 00:57.302
All this shit in that rowhouse.
Down yonder.

00:57.342 --> 01:00.345
Like a must-move situation.
15 on the dollar.

01:00.750 --> 01:04.479
Y'all want some slammin' ice,
go inside and tell my man Rafik sent you.

01:05.700 --> 01:08.564
Lighters, pipes, matches.
Pipes, lighters.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.722
You need 'em, I got 'em right here.

01:10.831 --> 01:11.289
Pipes.

01:12.056 --> 01:12.777
<i>Redis.</i>

01:13.622 --> 01:15.905
<i>Two for one, two for one.</i>

01:17.516 --> 01:18.986
As' me if it's loaded, bitch.

01:22.812 --> 01:24.235
<i>Redi-sons, two for one.</i>

01:29.086 --> 01:29.711
Anything up ?

01:30.494 --> 01:31.386
Just a good package.

01:31.839 --> 01:32.698
Three O.D.'s

01:32.870 --> 01:35.797
last one didn't look too good
before by the ambo came, neither.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:51.574 --> 01:52.731
There's more inside, Carv.

01:54.148 --> 01:54.992
Gah-damn !

01:55.072 --> 01:57.919
Can't yoever get a fucking poh-lice
'round here when you need one ?!

03:33.170 --> 03:34.968
Moral Midgetry

03:39.570 --> 03:40.760
Okay, on that burner ?

03:41.183 --> 03:43.404
I called Trac,
gave 'em the serial number.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.173
Trac Corporation tells me
that they sent it to Northland

03:46.204 --> 03:47.674
a purchasing corporation.

03:47.705 --> 03:51.261
Northland tells me they sent it
to their distribution center in Hagerstown.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.689
Hagerstown tells me they sent it
to buddy's Mondo Mart

03:55.017 --> 03:59.277
at one-four-four-o Propane Road,
Falls Church, Virginia

03:59.637 --> 04:01.639
that's where it went out
into the street.

04:02.187 --> 04:02.656
What ?

04:02.890 --> 04:06.519
Did buddy have them on display to the left
or the right of the cash register ?

04:08.426 --> 04:09.568
How would I know that ?

04:14.135 --> 04:14.902
Alright.

04:15.403 --> 04:17.601
As for the numbers
in the phone's speed dial

04:18.539 --> 04:19.978
we got one local number

04:20.119 --> 04:22.637
one number that tracks
to Bodie's grandmother's house

04:22.638 --> 04:23.750
on West Baltimore Street

04:23.921 --> 04:26.444
and six others numbers
that are all assigned

04:26.446 --> 04:28.620
to Trac disposable cell phones.

04:28.683 --> 04:31.093
And those phones were
all purchased outside the city.

04:31.733 --> 04:35.931
One each in Catonsville,
Laurel, Bethesda

04:36.245 --> 04:41.516
and stores in Virginia,
at Springfield, Dumfries and Lakeside.

04:42.190 --> 04:46.656
Everything is along I-95, from
here to almost Richmond.

04:47.814 --> 04:50.411
They're driving 200 miles
every couple of weeks

04:50.412 --> 04:51.851
out of sheer caution.

04:52.281 --> 04:53.234
It's beautiful.

04:55.942 --> 04:56.442
What is ?

04:59.006 --> 05:00.086
The discipline of it.

05:03.512 --> 05:06.030
In your life, did you think you
would ever again see

05:06.031 --> 05:07.456
Mount and Fayette like this ?

05:08.614 --> 05:10.279
Those ain't touts,
ya hearing, brother.

05:10.537 --> 05:11.848
Those are birds chirpin'.

05:12.395 --> 05:12.771
How ?

05:14.853 --> 05:15.822
I'll show you.

05:16.496 --> 05:18.967
You say no whistles,
no muscle, no flexin'.

05:18.983 --> 05:20.954
You supposed to be
all over that shit, man.

05:20.985 --> 05:23.637
You even said it's supposed
to be like the valley of eden.

05:23.668 --> 05:25.373
To serve, and protect,
motherfuckers.

05:25.404 --> 05:28.017
- Call it poetic injustice.
- I want to file a report.

05:28.299 --> 05:29.689
- Say what ?
- You heard me.

05:29.957 --> 05:31.662
You want to make
a complaint to us

05:31.932 --> 05:34.325
that you were selling drugs
and someone took your money ?

05:34.356 --> 05:35.044
Fuck yes.

05:42.984 --> 05:43.859
Fredericksburg ?

05:44.519 --> 05:46.538
They're going all
that way to buy cell phones ?

05:46.762 --> 05:49.238
One here, two there.
No wholesale purchases.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.746
They're dumping phones
every two weeks or so

05:51.828 --> 05:54.304
and still they're worried
about catching a wiretap.

05:55.228 --> 05:58.347
Just 'cause you're paranoid doesn't
mean someone's not out to get you.

05:58.358 --> 05:58.817
Right ?

05:59.931 --> 06:02.487
Be nice to know who's buying
all those cell phones, though.

06:07.039 --> 06:07.812
Oh, God.

06:31.163 --> 06:33.192
Yo, yo, yo, yo. You up, ol' man ?

06:33.740 --> 06:35.394
They do have a point though, right ?

06:36.155 --> 06:38.433
I mean, we tell 'em to comedown
here without the guns

06:38.445 --> 06:40.426
and then we fall down
on providing protection.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.959
It's like the stickup crews
have these hoppers feelin'

06:42.960 --> 06:44.215
like they live in a lamb pen.

06:44.929 --> 06:46.243
They see one more gun ?

06:46.607 --> 06:48.765
Gandhi-world falls apart,
this I guarantee.

06:49.516 --> 06:50.911
So what are you doing about it ?

06:51.192 --> 06:53.656
I sent a few of the vics
over to the district with Herc.

06:53.691 --> 06:56.361
Let 'em play with an ident-a-kit,
but you know how that goes.

06:56.760 --> 06:57.899
But can I be honest ?

06:58.603 --> 07:00.725
It's not just the wolves
circling the corral.

07:01.017 --> 07:03.637
We got 50, 60 kids on the inside

07:03.696 --> 07:06.001
been fight or flight since they
popped out of the chute

07:06.024 --> 07:08.301
and right now they're just
thumb-up-their-ass hangin'.

07:08.313 --> 07:09.954
All these ex-runners, ex-lookouts.

07:10.858 --> 07:13.508
That shit worries me as much
as any carnivores out there.

07:15.261 --> 07:17.056
If you want to neutralize a threat ?

07:18.405 --> 07:19.238
Give it a job.

07:20.458 --> 07:21.044
As ?

07:21.736 --> 07:22.722
Auxiliary cops.

07:23.601 --> 07:25.114
Keep an eye out for the predators.

07:25.759 --> 07:28.410
You got the dealers payin' 'em
to do nothing now anyway ?

07:28.760 --> 07:30.497
Kill two birds and all that.

07:30.521 --> 07:31.164
Right.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.120
Throw 'em some bikes,
maybe police radios.

07:34.390 --> 07:35.599
We could do that.

07:35.714 --> 07:36.864
I was being...

07:37.744 --> 07:38.506
you're serious ?

07:38.905 --> 07:40.735
What in God's name did you do here ?

07:42.506 --> 07:44.710
<i>W.M.D. Got them W.M.D.'s</i>

07:49.379 --> 07:50.422
Hey, how you doing ?

07:50.950 --> 07:52.711
We're looking for a guy
who came in here

07:52.735 --> 07:55.527
10, 11 days ago, dropped cash on
a couple of disposable phones ?

07:55.959 --> 07:57.202
10, 11 days ago ?

07:57.485 --> 07:58.991
Yeah. Black, most likely.

08:00.082 --> 08:01.419
That really narrows it down.

08:01.956 --> 08:04.270
How about we just check
on some of your security tapes ?

08:04.691 --> 08:05.548
From 10 days ago ?

08:06.404 --> 08:09.404
Unless there's an incident.
We re-use those video tapes every week.

08:10.074 --> 08:10.883
Every week ?

08:11.211 --> 08:12.501
It's Mondo Mart policy.

08:13.779 --> 08:14.788
That went well.

08:16.488 --> 08:16.926
Yeah ?

08:17.220 --> 08:18.709
<i>Brianna Barksdale called for you.</i>

08:18.732 --> 08:19.284
Who ?

08:19.894 --> 08:21.289
<i>D'angelo Barksdale's mother.</i>

08:21.853 --> 08:22.897
You get her number ?

08:23.637 --> 08:24.444
<i>You got a pen ?</i>

08:25.959 --> 08:30.506
<i>Four-one-oh, seven-one-eight,
nine-four-apple-three. Got it ?</i>

08:31.174 --> 08:31.632
Alright.

08:31.832 --> 08:32.864
<i>You gonna call her ?</i>

08:32.886 --> 08:33.450
I dunno...

08:33.791 --> 08:35.268
<i>- It's all yours.
- Thanks, Jay.</i>

08:36.181 --> 08:37.178
Hey, check it out.

08:37.645 --> 08:40.147
Mondo Mart, Mondo Mart,
Mondo Mart, Mondo Mart.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.422
We're fucked. Until we get here...

08:43.068 --> 08:45.132
Baba Jani Food Mart,
Dumfries, Virginia.

08:46.106 --> 08:47.592
We're gonna go 100 miles

08:47.603 --> 08:50.092
on the off-chance this guy
has a memory or a camera ?

08:50.432 --> 08:53.902
Do you really wanna go home early
and disappoint Lester Freamon ?

08:55.544 --> 08:56.788
Who was that who rang ?

08:56.885 --> 09:00.030
Guess who's calling homicide
looking for me on D'Angelo Barksdale ?

09:00.652 --> 09:01.532
His mama.

09:01.660 --> 09:02.177
Yeah ?

09:02.540 --> 09:04.757
Shit, I forgot I'd even tried
to press that thing

09:04.897 --> 09:06.810
and now she's
calling up asking questions.

09:06.820 --> 09:08.311
Waste of her time as it was mine.

09:11.043 --> 09:12.543
Kinda like this road trip.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.779
He do look natural.

09:24.896 --> 09:26.256
This motherfucker Marlo ?

09:27.921 --> 09:29.847
We gonna have to get
deep on this nigger.

09:33.801 --> 09:36.087
I mean it feels like
ain't shit change

09:36.147 --> 09:38.622
except for a growing
lightness in my wallet.

09:38.645 --> 09:41.890
Where's my letter of approval, man,
from the preservation motherfuckers ?

09:41.947 --> 09:43.779
My right-of-way agreement ?
My sign-offs.

09:43.804 --> 09:46.699
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
everything's right around the corner.

09:47.192 --> 09:50.675
We got both the plumbing and
the electrical inspectors on for tomorrow

09:50.838 --> 09:54.004
tuesday the fire department's coming out,
and that should do it, String

09:54.109 --> 09:55.271
you'll be on your way.

09:56.641 --> 09:59.798
And by the way, congratulations.

10:01.051 --> 10:04.793
You are now minority contractor
for light bulb supply

10:04.863 --> 10:07.009
to the Board of Education,
city of Baltimore.

10:09.004 --> 10:11.010
What the fuck I know
about light bulbs, man ?

10:11.082 --> 10:13.707
Do you know how to put the words
on a B-and-B letterhead ?

10:14.657 --> 10:18.058
Come on, man, relax,
white guy's doing all the work.

10:18.462 --> 10:20.691
You're just his beard
for the empowerment grant.

10:21.079 --> 10:24.305
That's an extra five g's a month
for just laying in the cut.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.064
See how it work ?

10:26.685 --> 10:28.775
I'm gonna bring you along,
String, but...

10:29.115 --> 10:30.745
it ain'tonna be an overnight thing.

10:31.874 --> 10:34.327
We spend this year
dealing with the city

10:34.619 --> 10:36.975
the next doing business
with the state.

10:37.610 --> 10:39.804
However, year three ?

10:40.731 --> 10:42.583
Then we go for the gold.

10:43.134 --> 10:44.801
Then we go federal.

10:45.165 --> 10:48.459
Then we see the man
with his hand on the faucet.

10:48.671 --> 10:49.516
What faucet ?

10:49.738 --> 10:53.358
The hud faucet, the money faucet.

10:53.604 --> 10:56.925
Look, man, I don't know why we got
to wait three years for that shit ?

10:56.949 --> 10:58.110
I'm ready to run now.

10:58.508 --> 11:00.033
No, you're not.

11:01.311 --> 11:03.303
I mean, forgive me, but...

11:03.596 --> 11:06.388
you still showin' a little bit of that
street corner mentality.

11:06.517 --> 11:08.711
buggin' about every dime you spend

11:08.723 --> 11:12.382
about the permits,
about setting up a pac

11:12.452 --> 11:16.029
about dropping cash
into re-election war chests

11:16.605 --> 11:18.682
which by the way,
is how i get my gravy.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.105
Look, it takes money
to make money, String

11:22.410 --> 11:24.370
otherwise, hell,
every pauper'd be a king.

11:25.016 --> 11:26.224
You know what I'm saying ?

11:27.173 --> 11:28.322
I'm ready to run now.

11:28.708 --> 11:29.603
Three years.

11:30.153 --> 11:34.915
Crawl, walk, and then run.

11:35.701 --> 11:38.085
Naw man, nappy up there
a little bit more.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.980
And the eyes.
He had little beanie eyes.

11:43.222 --> 11:45.205
What the fuck is beanie eyes ?

11:45.732 --> 11:47.858
You know, little rat-eyes.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.556
Yeah, a-ight.
Yo, put a mole on there.

11:51.225 --> 11:52.316
He didn't have a mole.

11:52.444 --> 11:53.500
He did too.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.986
You was just too busy shitting
yourself with that whistle

11:56.044 --> 11:57.697
to your dome
to see the motherfucker.

11:57.945 --> 11:59.294
Shit, fuck I did.

12:00.644 --> 12:01.992
How do you know how to do this ?

12:02.006 --> 12:04.237
Man, how you don't now
how to do this ?

12:05.398 --> 12:06.441
Make his ears stick out.

12:06.746 --> 12:08.434
- Why ?
- 'Cause I told you to.

12:10.651 --> 12:11.673
Ho shit, okay.

12:12.892 --> 12:14.238
Give him light eyes.

12:14.354 --> 12:16.455
- Why ?
- 'Cause I fuckin' told you to.

12:18.894 --> 12:20.924
Okay, can you make 'em cross ?

12:23.822 --> 12:24.843
This is fuckin' cool.

12:25.006 --> 12:27.224
Check out these knuckleheads
on the make-a-face.

12:36.412 --> 12:37.421
Fuck this shit.

12:38.983 --> 12:41.317
Look, I'm just tryin'
to make my district liveable.

12:41.798 --> 12:45.188
Write off a few blocks
in a few places but I save the rest.

12:45.445 --> 12:48.126
No offense, but you're like
the blind man and the elephant.

12:48.243 --> 12:50.332
It's a lot bigger than what
you got your hand on

12:50.345 --> 12:51.259
you just can't see it.

12:51.306 --> 12:51.974
See what ?

12:52.338 --> 12:54.425
A great village of pain,
and you're the mayor.

12:56.548 --> 12:57.864
Where's your drinking water ?

12:58.554 --> 13:01.687
Where's your toilets,
your heat, your electricity ?

13:03.295 --> 13:08.178
Where's the needle truck, the condom
distribution, the drug treatment intake ?

13:08.768 --> 13:10.633
Half these people
are dying on their feet

13:10.657 --> 13:12.934
and the other half's
gonna catch what's killin' 'em.

13:12.965 --> 13:15.860
Look, they ain't no worse off
than when they were all over the map.

13:16.224 --> 13:17.703
Now they just in one place is all.

13:17.713 --> 13:18.816
And that place is hell.

13:28.917 --> 13:30.231
Look, I'm a police.

13:30.805 --> 13:33.795
So I can lock a man up or I can
move his ass off the corner.

13:35.878 --> 13:37.507
Now, you want anything
more than that

13:37.919 --> 13:39.009
you're in the wrong shop.

13:41.145 --> 13:43.478
Hey, yo, make her hair
a little bit more straight.

13:44.723 --> 13:45.872
Make it long.

13:46.184 --> 13:47.227
With bangs.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.113
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

13:50.441 --> 13:52.893
Now chinese up them eyes,
like Beyonce.

13:53.444 --> 13:55.730
Get them cheekbones
up a little bit.

13:56.140 --> 13:57.638
Naw, man, that's too much.

13:57.674 --> 14:00.150
She startin' to look like
a pie tin with hair now, yo.

14:00.479 --> 14:01.218
Hang on.

14:02.355 --> 14:03.316
Yeah, alright.

14:03.492 --> 14:05.006
Pillow up them lips a little bit.

14:05.487 --> 14:07.127
Oh yeah, hook me up with that.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.757
Yo, you got one
of these does asses ?

14:15.173 --> 14:15.538
What ?

14:16.310 --> 14:18.317
Yeah, that's what's up, dang.

14:24.111 --> 14:24.860
Hey, guys.

14:26.938 --> 14:27.652
How you doing ?

14:28.164 --> 14:30.050
We're looking
for a cash purchase in here

14:30.051 --> 14:32.128
maybe a couple Trac phones,
week or so back.

14:32.233 --> 14:33.465
Black guy most likely.

14:33.570 --> 14:34.603
Oh sure, that guy.

14:35.025 --> 14:37.664
Every two weeks for him.
Last time, eight phones.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.108
Almost $900.

14:39.663 --> 14:41.226
That's a lot of ring dings, no ?

14:42.384 --> 14:43.006
Ring dings ?

14:43.535 --> 14:44.145
A joke.

14:49.012 --> 14:51.455
You got some kind
of transaction record ?

14:57.191 --> 14:58.949
Sikh and ye shall find.

15:00.803 --> 15:01.554
Hang on.

15:02.106 --> 15:02.868
Hang on.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.547
$927.24.

15:09.610 --> 15:11.087
Can we have the tape for that day ?

15:11.165 --> 15:12.960
No tape. I rewind every day.

15:17.545 --> 15:18.754
- Keep this ?
- Sure.

15:20.067 --> 15:21.441
The fuck do we do now ?

15:22.349 --> 15:23.933
Buy this guy a box of videotapes ?

15:24.496 --> 15:27.899
Or camp out in this shithole for a week,
hoping our boy runs the same route ?

15:34.261 --> 15:37.709
I just know, I got to put my mind
on something or I'm gonna slide back.

15:38.015 --> 15:40.629
Need to be in control of myself,
you know what I'm sayin' ?

15:40.723 --> 15:41.954
Take command of your life.

15:42.120 --> 15:42.662
Something.

15:43.214 --> 15:44.797
Cultivate some self-discipline.

15:44.844 --> 15:45.595
Or whatever.

15:46.394 --> 15:49.795
What if I told you that there's
a certain liberation

15:50.791 --> 15:52.856
not in command or in self-control

15:53.502 --> 15:54.475
but in surrendering ?

15:54.500 --> 15:56.786
Well, that depends on
who you're surrendering to.

15:59.438 --> 16:00.378
Oh, that.

16:01.892 --> 16:02.970
All due respect ?

16:03.227 --> 16:05.296
You can stow that patter
right here and now.

16:07.408 --> 16:10.693
Look, it ain't about me
doin' for me, I don't think.

16:11.408 --> 16:13.202
Might need to be
about more than that.

16:14.269 --> 16:17.961
So you're bringing in an overall decline
of two percent for the month

16:18.045 --> 16:20.941
but if I read this correctly,
almost half of that's coming from

16:20.953 --> 16:23.088
an eight percent drop
in the western district ?

16:23.123 --> 16:25.686
Major Colvin is himself
willing to acknowledge

16:25.687 --> 16:28.386
the possibility of a statistical
variation from the mean

16:28.387 --> 16:29.527
in his monthly stats.

16:30.016 --> 16:31.095
Variation, huh ?

16:33.184 --> 16:35.766
Gentlemen, if I look through
the western incident reports

16:35.813 --> 16:38.324
am I likely to find less crime,
or more incidents

16:38.347 --> 16:40.388
which have been
downgraded or unfounded ?

16:40.399 --> 16:44.154
Because this kind of variation
screams manipulation to me.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.358
And if I'm wrong about that

16:45.382 --> 16:47.235
if indeed there is
no manipulation involved

16:47.257 --> 16:49.700
I would like to know exactly
what it is that Major Colvin

16:49.724 --> 16:52.645
has learned about police work
that eludes the rest of your commanders.

16:52.656 --> 16:55.105
Councilman, I assure you
these stats are not massaged.

16:55.164 --> 16:56.005
We don't do that.

16:56.756 --> 16:57.647
I don't do that.

16:57.988 --> 16:59.733
And I won't allow
my people to do that.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.364
Our feeling is that
it's genuinely an aberration

17:02.844 --> 17:05.148
and if it repeats
itself next month

17:05.513 --> 17:07.592
then it bears closer
examination, otherwise...

17:07.605 --> 17:10.792
Moving on to new business then.
How are we fixed for witness assistance ?

17:10.992 --> 17:12.854
Does the department have
sufficient funds

17:12.877 --> 17:15.803
to ensure pre-trial security
for any endangered witnesses ?

17:18.025 --> 17:21.948
We have the resources that
the city can afford, I'm sure.

17:22.089 --> 17:24.567
I understand you're in no
position to criticize the Mayor.

17:24.589 --> 17:26.726
- Nor would I.
- Nor would you.

17:28.145 --> 17:29.705
So allow me to ask the question:

17:30.127 --> 17:33.172
What is this city willing to pay,
to make it possible for ordinary people

17:33.206 --> 17:35.753
to come down to the courthouse
and perform the civic duty

17:35.777 --> 17:38.056
of bearing witness against
gangsters and criminals ?

17:39.282 --> 17:42.197
What resources are commensurate
with that kind of commitment ?

17:44.589 --> 17:47.089
You can play the good soldier,
if you want, Commissioner.

17:47.124 --> 17:48.684
But I want to go on the record here

17:48.709 --> 17:51.863
in saying that this administration
has passed the buck time and again.

17:51.991 --> 17:55.562
And failed to protect those citizens
who demonstrate that kind of commitment

17:55.573 --> 17:58.096
and put their lives
and livelihood at risk.

17:59.421 --> 18:02.061
And I would only like to add,
that I feel as my colleague does

18:02.085 --> 18:05.497
that this administration has
failed this community miserably.

18:06.707 --> 18:08.442
And we need to do
something about this.

18:21.035 --> 18:22.138
Y'all are friends.

18:23.218 --> 18:24.180
Y'all like brothers.

18:26.243 --> 18:28.109
You lose that you lose
every damn thing.

18:35.777 --> 18:37.091
Kids messed up the good hoop

18:37.407 --> 18:39.700
now they got one looks like
the original peach basket

18:40.269 --> 18:41.899
an' they hangin' onto it like a tit.

18:43.812 --> 18:44.599
I don't know.

18:45.877 --> 18:48.070
Maybe I should get up
some kind of tournament.

18:48.811 --> 18:50.146
You play basketball ?

18:50.499 --> 18:52.295
Never was much
for balls and sticks.

18:52.854 --> 18:54.156
I was all about my hands.

18:54.274 --> 18:54.847
Boxer ?

18:55.096 --> 18:55.633
Yeah.

18:56.947 --> 18:57.488
Boxing.

18:58.965 --> 19:01.088
I know a place where
some of the kids go, but...

19:02.097 --> 19:03.787
it ain't nearly
close enough to here.

19:03.807 --> 19:05.413
I wouldn't mind
takin' a look at it.

19:06.375 --> 19:07.761
Get a mental picture at least.

19:09.309 --> 19:10.879
What the hell is goin' on here ?

19:12.392 --> 19:15.219
Police pushed all the action
down here and a couple other places.

19:15.230 --> 19:17.088
The Deacon thinks
that maybe some people

19:17.100 --> 19:19.387
should come in here
and take over this situation ?

19:19.469 --> 19:20.408
You that people ?

19:20.771 --> 19:22.097
One of 'em, maybe.

19:23.651 --> 19:24.495
Roman, man.

19:25.070 --> 19:25.798
Dennis.

19:38.326 --> 19:39.766
You should lay back on this one.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.726
Lemme go talk to Buford Pusser
in there alone.

19:42.607 --> 19:43.451
Excuse me ?

19:45.642 --> 19:48.269
And what it shows people
is that I know my business

19:48.281 --> 19:51.001
that I will hold people
accountable based on the facts.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.347
- This is about what's right.
- There you go again.

19:54.664 --> 19:55.156
What ?

19:55.509 --> 19:58.153
Do you think politics is only
about winning the argument ?

19:58.400 --> 20:01.062
That whoever has the right fact
at the right moment wins ?

20:01.905 --> 20:03.185
Clinton had facts.

20:03.430 --> 20:05.720
Kennedy had facts, yeah.
But Reagan ?

20:06.260 --> 20:08.757
He couldn't have summoned a fact
if his life depended on it.

20:08.769 --> 20:10.811
It's not just facts,
it's how you use them.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.263
And Tommy, when you
get hold of a fact or two

20:13.287 --> 20:15.201
you go smartass
and start beating on people.

20:15.222 --> 20:17.029
- That's because...
- Clinton and Reagan ?

20:17.051 --> 20:18.131
When they got up to speak

20:18.353 --> 20:21.562
they gave everyone in the room
comfort and confidence.

20:22.067 --> 20:23.006
You liked those guys.

20:23.018 --> 20:25.293
You were happy to think
that they even liked you.

20:26.782 --> 20:28.227
You're saying I'm not likeable ?

20:30.219 --> 20:30.644
Jen ?

20:32.605 --> 20:34.926
When you're at home, talking with me

20:34.927 --> 20:39.125
not the council, not the cameras,
you're great.

20:39.723 --> 20:42.440
When you tell me
what's really important to you

20:42.768 --> 20:43.988
I believe.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.359
You're smart and you're ambitious

20:46.360 --> 20:48.352
and you've got
a sharper tongue than most.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.017
You can hold court
and you can tell a good story

20:51.040 --> 20:53.374
and you can win
the argument if you want.

20:54.144 --> 20:55.867
All of that shows, Tommy

20:55.974 --> 20:58.448
and at a Baltimore
city council meeting it shows well

20:58.835 --> 21:00.183
but if you want to be mayor

21:00.418 --> 21:03.303
or senator, or governor one day...

21:04.497 --> 21:05.940
... show them something more.

21:09.377 --> 21:10.350
Baltimore, huh ?

21:11.264 --> 21:14.095
Went up there to the harbor with
my wife for our anniversary ?

21:14.565 --> 21:16.604
Charged us $12 for two beers.

21:17.449 --> 21:19.068
Shit, that's the least of it.

21:19.373 --> 21:22.046
The whole damn town's
gone to hell in a handbasket

21:22.700 --> 21:24.214
and guess who's running the show ?

21:24.401 --> 21:24.753
Who ?

21:25.670 --> 21:26.584
Who do you think ?

21:27.323 --> 21:29.833
The department, city hall, the courts.

21:29.962 --> 21:31.111
Shit, the courts ?

21:31.439 --> 21:33.064
You know what they call it when judge

21:33.098 --> 21:35.380
jury and perp all go
to the same family barbecue ?

21:36.294 --> 21:37.276
Catch and release.

21:38.248 --> 21:39.127
No shit.

21:39.397 --> 21:42.002
May God have mercy on any poor
white boy going to trial.

21:42.061 --> 21:45.204
That's when everybody's got their ass
in the air talking' about justice

21:45.221 --> 21:46.963
can't wait to throw away the key.

21:51.442 --> 21:54.000
I mean, they're not all so bad.

21:55.619 --> 21:57.483
Actually, there's a lot of good ones.

21:59.447 --> 22:01.158
I'm on the radio if you need me.

22:05.816 --> 22:07.868
My wife, Carol Ann.

22:09.627 --> 22:10.976
Some very good ones.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.276
Is there anything
specific I can help you with

22:13.288 --> 22:14.736
while you're down here, detective ?

22:14.765 --> 22:16.243
Or is this just a courtesy call ?

22:17.615 --> 22:20.073
You know, you should meet my partner.
You'd like her.

22:21.376 --> 22:23.206
Can't go through
the front on this boy.

22:23.615 --> 22:26.127
So I'm thinkin' we're gonna
have to creep around the back.

22:26.643 --> 22:27.781
Get Devonne on it ?

22:29.546 --> 22:31.235
I got this for that other problem.

22:36.010 --> 22:38.237
- Who this ?
- Remember Fat Face Rick, right ?

22:38.660 --> 22:40.712
Been going to them co-op
meetings with String ?

22:40.735 --> 22:41.812
That's his cousin, Trina.

22:41.835 --> 22:43.704
Oh you mean,
Trina with the big old ass.

22:43.716 --> 22:44.490
Yeah, you on it.

22:45.017 --> 22:47.880
That's her work number.
You know where she work nowadays ?

22:48.373 --> 22:50.681
She over at the department
of social services.

22:51.279 --> 22:52.978
So you thinkin' Omar gettin' a check ?

22:53.543 --> 22:55.795
Not now. But i mean
once upon a time, before...

22:56.592 --> 22:59.650
some fool gave lil' Omar
Little a shotgun, I mean

22:59.766 --> 23:01.621
cocksucker was
somebody's child, right ?

23:01.843 --> 23:03.932
So I'm thinking somewhere
down in them records

23:03.954 --> 23:05.667
is one or two names
of Omar's people.

23:05.960 --> 23:06.886
You feel me ?

23:07.239 --> 23:09.548
You sure you want us
on Marlo and Omar both ?

23:10.251 --> 23:13.020
I mean, Omar ain't come back
on us since we got his bitch

23:13.841 --> 23:16.069
- so maybe...
- Look, I'm home, Charles.

23:16.198 --> 23:17.067
I'm home.

23:19.368 --> 23:20.024
Was up ?

23:20.752 --> 23:22.229
Takin' care of business, String ?

23:25.726 --> 23:26.735
Me too, man.

23:27.320 --> 23:28.235
Me too.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.301
East side wasn't
ready for us, huh ?

23:49.263 --> 23:50.535
That's what I'm saying.

23:58.720 --> 24:02.203
Yeah, I know all about Baba Jani
and his 24-hour turnover.

24:02.531 --> 24:04.056
It's a real pain in my ass too.

24:04.889 --> 24:07.143
He's got a little problem
with the school kids there.

24:07.167 --> 24:08.221
Every afternoon come 3:00

24:08.233 --> 24:10.041
they go in there,
crowd him at the counter

24:10.380 --> 24:12.045
boost all the car
and gun magazines.

24:12.601 --> 24:14.326
That surveillance tape's
so grainy now

24:14.337 --> 24:16.636
it's like watching a herd
of buffalo in a snowstorm.

24:16.859 --> 24:19.416
But my insurance man, Bob ?

24:19.895 --> 24:22.700
Got him to turn this camera here
right on Baba's parking lot.

24:23.475 --> 24:25.188
Now anytime I have a real problem ?

24:25.330 --> 24:27.101
I just come to Bob
and pull his tape.

24:28.391 --> 24:30.503
I can get a copy of that
for you in the morning.

24:34.044 --> 24:34.676
Your...

24:35.895 --> 24:36.902
Your partner there ?

24:37.982 --> 24:39.472
Bit of an asshole.

24:41.115 --> 24:41.899
For real ?

25:15.194 --> 25:16.446
<i>Keep your right hand up.</i>

25:26.445 --> 25:27.512
You know what this is ?

25:28.040 --> 25:29.203
It's moral midgetry.

25:30.412 --> 25:32.008
Turn the fuckin' world upside down.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.294
Treat these braindead
corner yo's like princelings.

25:34.881 --> 25:36.443
You see how clean the corners are ?

25:36.759 --> 25:39.210
In every sector, street traffic
is half of what it was.

25:39.327 --> 25:41.520
Fuck that.
It's wrong, and it's wrong.

25:42.024 --> 25:44.604
Like the other way was right
because we were doing so well.

25:44.612 --> 25:46.119
And Colvin's answer is what ?

25:46.195 --> 25:48.753
Ride shotgun for hoppers ?
Drown them in cash money paid ?

25:48.778 --> 25:50.748
Colvin ?
He's always been good police.

25:50.782 --> 25:52.684
He's got to know
what a fuckin' heartbreaker

25:52.707 --> 25:54.959
it is to wake up every morning,
suit up for this shit.

25:54.978 --> 25:56.325
He's got to suit up too, man.

25:57.064 --> 25:59.209
Somebody should dime
the brass about this shit.

25:59.995 --> 26:00.935
Or the Sun papers.

26:01.040 --> 26:02.305
Let me ask you something.

26:02.987 --> 26:04.265
Anybody here ever get jammed up

26:04.288 --> 26:06.272
and not have Colvin
go to the wall for you ?

26:06.906 --> 26:08.218
The man is trying something.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.390
It may be hard to stomach,
but it's working.

26:10.730 --> 26:13.016
After 30 years don't you think
he's earned the right

26:13.028 --> 26:14.177
to some elbow room on this ?

26:14.224 --> 26:16.689
What the fuck. This thing is
on borrowed time anyhow.

26:17.631 --> 26:20.351
And when we do decide
to jump on the Hamsterdams

26:20.387 --> 26:22.967
they're just gonna go back to
their regular corners, right ?

26:23.049 --> 26:24.317
If we ever jump out on it.

26:25.571 --> 26:26.837
I don't know that we're gonna.

26:26.862 --> 26:29.098
All I'm sayin' is we give
the guy the same back-up

26:29.134 --> 26:30.589
he's always given us.

26:31.363 --> 26:32.583
That's all I'm sayin'.

26:38.210 --> 26:41.306
I swear as soon as the sun comes
up we grab the damn tape and go.

26:41.892 --> 26:43.404
This place makes me want to cry.

26:44.750 --> 26:47.025
Hey, I spent half my marriage
in rooms like this.

26:49.205 --> 26:50.240
How could you do it ?

26:51.987 --> 26:52.562
What ?

26:54.187 --> 26:56.114
Go non-stop hound
on your ex like that.

26:56.958 --> 26:57.603
It was easy.

26:58.178 --> 27:00.557
Just tell her I was on the road
working an extradition.

27:01.801 --> 27:03.126
Lots of extraditions.

27:04.112 --> 27:05.985
Brought back something
like 500 fugitives

27:05.996 --> 27:07.394
in a three-year period, I think.

27:08.155 --> 27:09.235
That's not what I meant.

27:10.642 --> 27:11.134
Right.

27:17.717 --> 27:19.441
So, you back in the house, huh ?

27:21.869 --> 27:23.804
Ate some shit
and she took me back, yeah.

27:25.899 --> 27:27.844
Ain't sure I even want
to be back, though.

27:33.922 --> 27:34.919
Extraditions, huh ?

27:37.632 --> 27:39.355
Cheryl'd see right
through that shit.

27:39.485 --> 27:40.411
Nah, it's easy.

27:41.890 --> 27:44.844
Just keep your cell off,
make sure she can reach your partner.

27:45.127 --> 27:47.767
Partner tells her:
"Kima's in court" or whatever.

27:48.473 --> 27:50.726
Partner calls you at the motel
gives you the heads up

27:50.738 --> 27:52.849
you call her back later like:
"hey, what's up ?"

28:00.600 --> 28:03.274
Ain't even have a quarter box
for magic fingers.

28:05.914 --> 28:07.859
Maybe you don't need
a quarter box for that.

28:09.408 --> 28:09.936
For what ?

28:11.861 --> 28:12.916
Magic fingers.

28:21.604 --> 28:22.730
Hey, you know me.

28:23.986 --> 28:26.414
<i>...we'll talk with a singer
songwriter who's burning up</i>

28:26.437 --> 28:28.900
<i>the charts with a hit
he'll perform for us tonight.</i>

28:45.528 --> 28:46.313
You hustlin' ?

28:46.887 --> 28:47.837
Educatin'.

28:50.697 --> 28:52.235
Charging for it or tuition-free ?

28:52.822 --> 28:55.906
Tuition will come back to him
ten-fold in acquired wisdom.

28:56.435 --> 28:59.241
Besides, nothing in the world's
more expensive than "free".

28:59.762 --> 29:00.746
S'all she wrote.

29:02.542 --> 29:03.632
Let's double it.

29:03.761 --> 29:06.764
Naw man, I don't like takin'
money from a church-goin' man.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.420
Triple it.

29:07.632 --> 29:08.699
Your break, Deacon.

29:14.390 --> 29:16.443
We need to talk
some more about Amsterdam.

29:16.606 --> 29:18.382
Look, man,
I never said it was pretty.

29:18.570 --> 29:20.552
Pretty don't even
come close to the problem.

29:21.992 --> 29:23.212
We need to talk.

29:27.309 --> 29:28.587
I've got comstat meeting.

29:30.194 --> 29:31.569
I'll drop by later on.

29:36.307 --> 29:37.620
So we good with the permits ?

29:37.680 --> 29:39.508
Yeah, this week, so far, so good.

29:39.682 --> 29:40.209
A-ight.

29:41.558 --> 29:42.356
Look at you.

29:43.049 --> 29:43.459
Who ?

29:44.058 --> 29:44.983
Chunky Coates.

29:45.888 --> 29:46.567
Who's that ?

29:46.675 --> 29:47.764
You don't know Chunky ?

29:48.398 --> 29:50.423
He's got the properties
down the block and over

29:50.447 --> 29:51.795
on the even side of Paca Street.

29:51.878 --> 29:54.775
When I first met that fat man,
he had an office so small

29:54.776 --> 29:57.003
you had to leave
the room to change your mind.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.934
Then two years ago he started running
with your man, Clay Davis.

30:02.477 --> 30:04.777
Look at you now,
you big sassy bitch.

30:06.244 --> 30:07.071
That better ?

30:09.415 --> 30:11.808
Hey, special agent Fitzhugh

30:12.067 --> 30:13.532
if that is in fact your real name.

30:15.550 --> 30:16.641
FBI in on this ?

30:17.967 --> 30:19.679
I am only loved for my toys.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.661
Lester called and I delivered.

30:21.730 --> 30:22.516
You got the tape ?

30:24.464 --> 30:27.630
Date of ten-ten-oh-four,
fifteen-oh-four hours

30:27.642 --> 30:29.973
30 seconds, by the register tape.

30:36.424 --> 30:37.363
Mama Barksdale ?

30:40.096 --> 30:41.269
D'Angelo's mother.

30:41.609 --> 30:44.553
She cold-called McNulty
about her son on the jailhouse hangin'.

30:45.527 --> 30:47.310
She's callin' us
on that weak shit ?

30:47.895 --> 30:48.881
Is this, uh...

30:49.045 --> 30:49.645
Brianna ?

30:51.019 --> 30:51.430
Right.

30:52.675 --> 30:54.984
You called about your son.
I'm returning that message.

30:58.914 --> 30:59.828
Nothing there.

31:01.124 --> 31:02.121
It's so tiny.

31:02.953 --> 31:04.513
No mere mortal can.

31:07.107 --> 31:08.468
You see what he just did ?

31:10.573 --> 31:12.356
What ? He did it again ?

31:12.990 --> 31:14.116
Who is this man ?

31:14.373 --> 31:15.534
Where does he come from ?

31:16.227 --> 31:18.467
Can anybody stop him ?
Please don't hurt us.

31:18.479 --> 31:22.909
Please my eyes, my eyes.
It's so big and clear and bright.

31:23.683 --> 31:24.598
I'll be at homicide.

31:25.665 --> 31:27.672
Sometimes, you still scare me,
you know that ?

31:35.891 --> 31:39.293
In my world, do you have
any idea what I had to do

31:39.655 --> 31:40.982
to get where I am today ?

31:42.192 --> 31:45.204
Now when I say i ready,
you best believe it.

31:49.758 --> 31:51.500
Through the effective
use of resources

31:51.630 --> 31:53.166
an increased police presence

31:53.718 --> 31:56.403
and an intensive reach
out into the community

31:57.578 --> 32:00.076
we've been able to have
a significant impact on these areas

32:00.521 --> 32:03.219
to the effect
of a 12% decrease overall.

32:03.981 --> 32:04.731
12%.

32:05.388 --> 32:06.092
Cumulatively.

32:06.831 --> 32:07.852
Over four weeks.

32:08.096 --> 32:10.032
Major, I know I gave you shit

32:10.115 --> 32:13.060
when your stats took
a jump a few weeks back

32:13.737 --> 32:16.177
but now you're gonna shove
the numbers right up my ass.

32:17.904 --> 32:19.579
It's kind of pouty of you,
isn't it ?

32:19.733 --> 32:20.388
12%.

32:21.305 --> 32:23.464
I didn't cook 'em then,
I ain't cookin' 'em now.

32:23.627 --> 32:26.512
Seriously, Bunny. I already got
the City Council asking questions

32:26.523 --> 32:28.730
about the eight percent drop
you posted last week.

32:29.539 --> 32:32.754
We just want to please the Mayor,
not go to jail behind this shit.

32:34.791 --> 32:36.608
Sometimes the Gods do listen, sir.

32:36.630 --> 32:37.923
Not in the Western they don't.

32:38.544 --> 32:39.471
Lieutenant Daniels.

32:39.928 --> 32:40.461
Sir ?

32:41.036 --> 32:42.947
You want to take credit
for any of this ?

32:43.287 --> 32:45.961
Your unit's been working in
that district a couple of weeks.

32:46.570 --> 32:47.979
We're barely up on anything.

32:48.472 --> 32:50.678
In fact, the crews we're
looking at are still beefing

32:50.829 --> 32:51.985
still dropping bodies.

32:52.339 --> 32:53.066
Amazing.

32:53.852 --> 32:56.397
Crime is down and no one
wants to take any credit.

32:56.432 --> 32:58.311
What is wrong with this picture ?

32:59.493 --> 33:01.483
You don't mind
if I have planning and research

33:01.507 --> 33:02.667
pull all your C.C. numbers

33:03.208 --> 33:06.399
make sure there's not a decimal point
missing between the one and the two ?

33:06.410 --> 33:07.480
Pull everything, Deputy.

33:08.124 --> 33:09.215
My number will stand.

33:11.046 --> 33:14.203
<i>Hey, tell Landsman, line
twenty-one-oh-three's for him.</i>

33:21.988 --> 33:24.497
I called because I heard
you went and visited Donette

33:26.104 --> 33:28.438
told her my son's death
couldn't have been no suicide.

33:28.461 --> 33:29.248
Is that right ?

33:30.749 --> 33:31.512
I did do that.

33:33.881 --> 33:35.770
D'Angelo hung himself.

33:38.035 --> 33:40.052
Not with the belt
they found around his neck.

33:40.368 --> 33:42.863
Not at that distance between
the doorknob and the floor.

33:44.714 --> 33:45.736
So what are you saying ?

33:47.918 --> 33:48.786
What am I saying.

33:50.042 --> 33:50.486
No.

33:52.070 --> 33:53.334
Nobody would've dared.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.690
My brother,
his uncle would have...

33:56.900 --> 33:57.594
I agree with you.

33:59.305 --> 34:00.596
Nobody would've dared.

34:02.435 --> 34:03.303
Unless...

34:05.486 --> 34:07.185
Avon and Dee was family.

34:07.818 --> 34:08.862
Family, right.

34:13.942 --> 34:15.467
This is just you talking, right ?

34:16.417 --> 34:17.835
I mean, anyone else saying that...

34:17.895 --> 34:18.693
Nah, just me.

34:19.913 --> 34:21.014
No one else cares.

34:22.036 --> 34:22.482
Right.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.764
It's just, I dunno, on the inside

34:27.103 --> 34:28.349
if somebody's going after you

34:28.360 --> 34:31.081
has got a beef, sees red,
they use a shank.

34:32.125 --> 34:33.627
It's quick and it's over.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.208
D'Angelo was strangled

34:37.810 --> 34:38.842
which is planned.

34:39.417 --> 34:41.599
You need the time,
you need the isolation.

34:44.706 --> 34:47.366
Look, I'm just sorry I brought
this whole mess up to begin with

34:47.378 --> 34:49.760
because frankly nobody's
gonna do shit about it anyhow.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.712
Whoever killed him wanted
to pass it off as a suicide

34:53.735 --> 34:56.663
and the cops are happy enough
to have one less murder to investigate.

34:56.697 --> 34:59.679
On top of that, the Anne Arundel
State's Attorney doesn't give a fuck

34:59.701 --> 35:01.438
I'm not supposed
to give a fuck, so...

35:03.996 --> 35:06.305
I guess your son just got
squeezed between the sides.

35:08.171 --> 35:09.825
Squeezed between what sides ?

35:11.055 --> 35:12.239
Look, two years ago

35:12.556 --> 35:16.123
we hung more wire
on your brother's crew than AT&T

35:16.450 --> 35:18.806
and at the end, D'Angelo was
this close to flipping.

35:18.830 --> 35:20.262
Giving up everybody, everything.

35:20.448 --> 35:21.832
But you know all that right ?

35:22.312 --> 35:24.646
You were the one who went down
to that detention center

35:24.658 --> 35:26.149
and talked your son out of a deal.

35:30.155 --> 35:31.705
I kinda liked your son, you know ?

35:34.308 --> 35:36.596
All things considered,
he was a pretty decent kid.

35:37.042 --> 35:39.353
And it grinds me that no one
ever spoke up for him

35:40.738 --> 35:42.485
and seems to me
that nobody ever will.

35:43.623 --> 35:45.077
But mostly at this point ?

35:45.124 --> 35:48.103
I'm sorry I bothered his girl
and I'm sorry she bothered you.

35:50.823 --> 35:51.657
Why go to her ?

35:53.547 --> 35:54.779
Why not come to me first ?

35:55.834 --> 35:56.467
Honestly ?

35:58.391 --> 36:00.684
I was looking for somebody
who cared about the kid.

36:01.511 --> 36:02.941
I mean, like I said...

36:03.796 --> 36:06.108
you were the one how made him
take the years, right ?

36:20.323 --> 36:21.755
<i>Red leader to red boys.</i>

36:23.350 --> 36:24.229
<i>Red two come in.</i>

36:25.895 --> 36:27.431
<i>Cheese steak has a problem, bitch.</i>

36:29.192 --> 36:30.516
Save me some fries, yo...

36:31.053 --> 36:31.880
<i>You want fries.</i>

36:32.180 --> 36:33.975
<i>I suggest you bring
some cash up here.</i>

36:35.324 --> 36:36.272
You believe this ?

36:37.493 --> 36:40.425
No muscle,
it's all out in the open.

36:42.558 --> 36:44.236
Naw naw naw, man...

36:45.057 --> 36:46.431
This right here, boy.

36:47.380 --> 36:48.423
This too good.

36:51.274 --> 36:53.789
Hey yo, this some kinda
full-tilt setup, man

36:53.828 --> 36:56.431
to catch some master-scoundrel,
Capone an' whatnot.

36:57.253 --> 37:00.327
Boy, they prob'ly got police behind
every one of those rowhouse windows.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.319
Hit this ?

37:02.586 --> 37:03.572
You must be trippin'.

37:04.709 --> 37:05.670
Home, James...

37:08.040 --> 37:09.961
I'ma tell you, boy,
you better keep your head

37:09.973 --> 37:12.352
back in the game or you gonna
land us both in the pokey.

37:50.489 --> 37:52.237
- What you lookin' at ?
- You.

37:54.008 --> 37:54.560
Yeah.

37:55.662 --> 37:57.174
I like you're eyes.

37:57.866 --> 37:59.427
They like cat's eyes.

38:00.131 --> 38:01.117
Who you here with ?

38:01.691 --> 38:02.300
Them.

38:04.235 --> 38:04.809
That's it ?

38:06.216 --> 38:07.238
What kind of cat ?

38:08.316 --> 38:08.844
What ?

38:09.408 --> 38:10.946
What kind of cat my eyes like ?

38:13.908 --> 38:15.070
A big cat.

38:18.449 --> 38:20.092
You here with them
and no one else ?

38:20.116 --> 38:20.725
I said that.

38:21.604 --> 38:22.824
You want to dance ?

38:23.340 --> 38:23.910
Hell, no.

38:25.023 --> 38:25.890
You want a drink ?

38:26.432 --> 38:27.711
No, don't do that neither.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.490
What do you do ?

38:51.821 --> 38:53.578
Gene, this spot
I'm telling you about ?

38:53.791 --> 38:59.165
We're talking TB, HIV, syphilis, herpes, lice...

38:59.670 --> 39:01.534
It's like a five-acre petri dish.

39:01.558 --> 39:02.613
You get in there now

39:03.235 --> 39:06.283
you can run every health program
or social program you want.

39:06.611 --> 39:08.032
Every kinda liberal-ass project

39:08.055 --> 39:09.898
never got off the page
it was written on.

39:10.765 --> 39:11.867
Jurassic park.

39:12.450 --> 39:14.974
So, you're saying this is a
sanctioned open-air drug market.

39:14.985 --> 39:16.697
No, it's not officially sanctioned.

39:17.342 --> 39:18.715
It's more like it's tolerated.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.963
That's why we came to
you and the public health school

39:21.987 --> 39:23.313
not the city health department.

39:23.321 --> 39:28.211
Needle exchange, drug outreach,
condoms, HIV-testing.

39:28.633 --> 39:31.145
Y'all ain't never gonna reach
more people in the same spot.

39:31.180 --> 39:33.449
So if the city doesn't know about it.
That makes it...

39:33.474 --> 39:34.248
Complicated.

39:34.461 --> 39:35.610
That means temporary.

39:35.892 --> 39:37.628
You move it or you lose it, boss.

40:02.392 --> 40:03.400
That was nice.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.191
Work for me.

40:10.545 --> 40:11.672
You free tomorrow ?

40:12.702 --> 40:13.498
Tomorrow ?

40:15.163 --> 40:18.659
You could come back to my crib,
nobody's there but my grandma.

40:19.563 --> 40:22.802
Get us a real bed,
take some time with it.

40:25.218 --> 40:26.438
Give me your number.

40:31.048 --> 40:32.937
The reason I'm sayin'
tomorrow not to push

40:33.019 --> 40:35.942
but day after that I got
to go visit my aunt in Florida.

40:37.454 --> 40:40.352
We hook up tomorrow,
I got something real nice

40:40.364 --> 40:42.698
to think about
on that long-ass bus ride.

40:46.653 --> 40:47.581
After you.

40:53.235 --> 40:54.360
What was it again ?

40:54.723 --> 40:55.687
Devonne.

41:18.551 --> 41:20.722
This guys running
his route every five days.

41:21.473 --> 41:22.785
That's a shitload of burners.

41:22.832 --> 41:23.525
I don't get it.

41:24.286 --> 41:26.538
They're were so careful
spreading out the purchases

41:26.550 --> 41:27.816
up and down the three states

41:28.110 --> 41:30.661
you'd think he'd also
switch up rental agencies.

41:31.387 --> 41:33.007
Maybe the guy felt bad for us.

41:34.260 --> 41:35.434
You got a copier, right ?

41:51.857 --> 41:53.640
Damn, girl,
what you lose some weight ?

41:54.051 --> 41:54.766
Excuse me ?

41:55.082 --> 41:56.349
It's just a compliment.

42:26.433 --> 42:27.464
Yo, at's Mrs. Omar ?

42:29.858 --> 42:31.137
Yeah, his grandmoms.

42:31.617 --> 42:33.707
So what, we jack her
an' make her talk ?

42:33.954 --> 42:37.063
Fool, she probably got no clue
where he lay his head.

42:39.725 --> 42:42.153
Naw, man,
we sit an' we wait, right ?

42:44.752 --> 42:46.382
Man, wait on what ?

42:52.776 --> 42:54.827
You see, if we go upstairs,
we'll spook him.

42:55.290 --> 42:56.277
So he's coming down.

42:57.274 --> 42:57.767
Alright.

43:12.152 --> 43:12.986
Russell Bell.

43:15.883 --> 43:18.544
I know B-and-B like I know
a thousand other outfits

43:18.991 --> 43:20.129
but I don't know him.

43:20.703 --> 43:21.878
Why should I talk to him ?

43:22.039 --> 43:23.599
Because Russell's a good man.

43:23.906 --> 43:26.087
And he's ready to run.

43:27.585 --> 43:28.733
Then let him run for you.

43:29.308 --> 43:29.883
Hang on.

43:30.482 --> 43:31.830
Wait a minute, partner.

43:32.101 --> 43:34.516
I don't think you know who
you're dealing with here.

43:34.644 --> 43:35.642
You know who that is ?

43:49.575 --> 43:50.864
Got your running shoes on ?

43:51.640 --> 43:52.272
You're in.

43:53.094 --> 43:54.197
That's the faucet ?

43:54.314 --> 43:57.199
Shit, as far as the federal money's
concerned, he's everything.

43:57.539 --> 43:58.630
The faucet, the goose...

43:58.653 --> 43:59.322
What goose ?

43:59.728 --> 44:01.830
The one that lays them golden eggs.

44:19.471 --> 44:21.101
Madison Square Garden it ain't

44:22.525 --> 44:23.850
but it could work.

44:27.310 --> 44:29.550
You're gonna need
a little help with the clean-up.

44:29.632 --> 44:30.793
I'll piece that together.

44:36.079 --> 44:37.358
This my trip, man.

44:38.930 --> 44:41.276
Need to go from
"a" to "b" all by my self.

44:43.387 --> 44:44.994
<i>... Am I likely to find less crime</i>

44:45.030 --> 44:48.066
<i>or more incidents that have
been downgraded or unfounded ?</i>

44:48.090 --> 44:50.777
<i>Because this kind of variation
screams manipulation to me.</i>

44:50.801 --> 44:52.044
Slow your words.

44:52.056 --> 44:53.885
<i>Indeed there is no
manipulation involved...</i>

44:53.909 --> 44:56.082
Try to lock your eyes
on whoever you talk to.

44:56.318 --> 44:58.289
Make them think they matter.

44:59.213 --> 45:02.910
Use open, warm phrases.
nothing sharp, nothing that bites.

45:02.992 --> 45:04.119
Where's the fun in that ?

45:05.008 --> 45:05.934
Do you want this ?

45:11.271 --> 45:12.668
<i>What is this city willing to pay</i>

45:12.704 --> 45:14.720
<i>to make it possible
for ordinary people to...</i>

45:14.756 --> 45:15.367
It's me.

45:15.436 --> 45:16.786
<i>Hey, how you cat eyes ?</i>

45:16.856 --> 45:18.195
When you say ya leaving again ?

45:18.240 --> 45:20.001
<i>Tomorrow, wanna
get together tonight ?</i>

45:20.023 --> 45:21.302
Yeah, we can hook up tonight.

45:22.299 --> 45:23.966
<i>How about coming over
to my crib ?</i>

45:24.974 --> 45:26.019
Naw, not your crib.

45:26.221 --> 45:26.959
<i>Where then ?</i>

45:27.546 --> 45:28.448
Go to a motel.

45:29.152 --> 45:30.254
<i>You want me to meet you ?</i>

45:31.205 --> 45:31.779
<i>Which one ?</i>

45:31.814 --> 45:32.871
I don't know which one.

45:33.750 --> 45:35.040
I'll tell you when I see you.

45:35.487 --> 45:36.822
<i>I'd like to see you soon.</i>

45:37.482 --> 45:39.370
Alright, you know the Lake Trout ?

45:39.662 --> 45:40.343
<i>Carryout ?</i>

45:41.002 --> 45:41.645
<i>Where ?</i>

45:41.870 --> 45:42.749
On Woodland.

45:42.785 --> 45:44.005
<i>Off Midtown Road.</i>

45:44.404 --> 45:44.966
That one.

45:45.119 --> 45:46.057
<i>Later this afternoon ?</i>

45:47.147 --> 45:48.001
<i>I'll be there.</i>

45:48.599 --> 45:50.125
<i>What time you want to meet ?</i>

45:50.464 --> 45:51.154
Like five.

45:52.259 --> 45:55.073
And five mean five.
I don't truck C.P. time.

45:55.402 --> 45:56.539
Five and change, I'm gone.

45:57.043 --> 45:58.030
<i>I ain't gonna be late.</i>

45:58.300 --> 45:59.015
Alright then.

45:59.534 --> 46:00.541
<i>See you then.</i>

46:05.609 --> 46:06.870
What you think about that ?

46:12.133 --> 46:12.883
I don't know.

46:14.572 --> 46:16.650
Might be walkin'
into something a little later.

46:17.522 --> 46:19.293
So I'm gonna need
for you to go up there

46:19.304 --> 46:20.300
get me a read up front.

46:30.178 --> 46:31.153
Where's my brother ?

46:31.163 --> 46:32.079
Shut the door, man.

46:34.461 --> 46:36.771
Yo, we at war right now, sis.
So he on that.

46:37.146 --> 46:38.249
I need to get with him.

46:38.849 --> 46:40.211
Well, he ain't on the cell phone

46:40.234 --> 46:42.639
soon as I speak to him,
I'll get him to you, alright ?

46:43.400 --> 46:44.562
Can't believe this shit.

46:49.652 --> 46:50.803
Heard from this cop.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.139
He sayin' Dee was murdered.

46:53.326 --> 46:55.438
Oh, that'd be McNulty.

46:56.809 --> 46:57.853
How you know ?

46:58.897 --> 47:01.124
Levy figured he couldn't
talk you out of that meet

47:01.148 --> 47:02.425
but I sure wish he'da tried.

47:03.855 --> 47:05.217
I need to get with my brother.

47:05.381 --> 47:06.132
Oh, c'mon.

47:07.622 --> 47:09.100
This fucking cop.

47:10.290 --> 47:12.025
He trying to drive
a wedge up in here.

47:12.284 --> 47:13.164
You can't see it.

47:19.839 --> 47:21.399
Look, I can imagine
how hard it is

47:21.424 --> 47:23.817
for a mother to have to deal
with some shit like that.

47:23.840 --> 47:26.902
No doubt. But the fact is,
these places, they press on niggers.

47:28.496 --> 47:30.806
Dee just figured a way
to get out of there early.

47:31.240 --> 47:33.142
Ain't nothing nobody
could do about that.

47:36.402 --> 47:38.538
I mean, how do you
protect a man from himself ?

47:39.299 --> 47:40.227
Where Avon at ?

47:40.778 --> 47:41.587
I'll go to him.

47:41.921 --> 47:45.006
I told you. We beefin' for corners
right now and as soon as I speak to him

47:45.030 --> 47:46.332
I'll get him to you, I promise.

47:51.117 --> 47:53.365
A cop shouldn't mess
with a mother's pain like that.

47:53.507 --> 47:54.362
No one should.

48:07.091 --> 48:09.106
Yeah, let me get
four trout on white

48:09.505 --> 48:12.310
extra mayo on one,
hot sauce on two

48:12.333 --> 48:14.805
and the other with ketchup,
and four orange sodas.

48:54.981 --> 48:57.714
This clown ass nigger went
and got four sammiches.

48:57.749 --> 48:59.356
Four sodas, you heard me ?

48:59.954 --> 49:00.599
Cool.

49:06.350 --> 49:08.953
Niggas don't roll out in a few
minutes, we on to something.

49:14.161 --> 49:15.872
<i>Drop one, get one.</i>

49:17.072 --> 49:18.786
Nah, baby, this one's sentimental.

49:19.315 --> 49:20.347
Here, it's bleach.

49:20.664 --> 49:22.632
Just soak your works
and you're good to go.

49:24.933 --> 49:26.316
<i>Drop one get one.</i>

49:28.501 --> 49:29.885
<i>Drop one, get one.</i>

49:31.539 --> 49:33.014
Get the other girls to come by.

49:36.581 --> 49:37.073
Or wait.

49:39.068 --> 49:40.991
Just pass these out for me, okay ?

49:44.730 --> 49:46.443
Yo, I get swoled up
from Peanut Butter.

49:46.466 --> 49:47.451
You got anything else ?

49:47.475 --> 49:49.322
The fuck I look like to you,
Chef Boyardee ?

49:49.334 --> 49:49.686
Who ?

49:49.704 --> 49:52.917
Hey, when all this bullshit falls apart,
I'm gonna kick your fucking... !

50:24.316 --> 50:25.265
Go by them slow.

50:46.156 --> 50:46.977
Oh shit !

50:48.467 --> 50:49.370
<i>Oh, my god !</i>

50:51.200 --> 50:51.658
You hit ?

50:52.384 --> 50:52.854
No.

50:53.007 --> 50:54.942
Drive, motherfucker,
get out of here !

51:13.714 --> 51:15.732
Your man better be
as good as his word.

51:16.659 --> 51:17.351
Or your word.

51:21.750 --> 51:24.459
If you are still in possession
of that kind of mentality ?

51:24.916 --> 51:26.558
Then you are definitely not ready.

51:27.380 --> 51:28.633
- String ?
- Not now.

51:28.857 --> 51:30.276
- It's Avon...
- Shut the door.

51:35.575 --> 51:36.255
Let's do this.

51:41.851 --> 51:42.894
I'll be in touch, partner.

51:46.154 --> 51:47.845
- What is it, man ?
- Avon's been hit.

51:47.856 --> 51:49.101
- Where ?
- In the shoulder.

51:49.124 --> 51:52.208
Tater got kilt, but Avon
still breathin', man.

51:53.173 --> 51:54.980
But Brianna all over me,
calling me, man.

51:54.991 --> 51:56.867
- I need to tell her.
- Naw, fuck Brianna.

51:56.915 --> 51:57.359
What ?

51:57.431 --> 51:59.543
Just keep the bitch
away from me, ya hear me ?

52:11.151 --> 52:13.158
If you put them
pitbull-style stitches in me

52:13.170 --> 52:14.507
the next patient's gonna be you.

52:14.953 --> 52:15.915
For real.

52:16.173 --> 52:17.617
What, you don't like rawhide ?

52:18.894 --> 52:20.138
Oooh, Marlo.

52:21.826 --> 52:23.833
We're finally gettin'
back to old times, baby.

52:34.748 --> 52:37.209
Hey, Anthony, where you at ?

52:38.987 --> 52:41.454
First-floor, 10-34 North Mount, sir.

52:44.301 --> 52:44.843
Good.

52:55.257 --> 52:57.133
They expecting us to hit back wild.

52:57.438 --> 52:58.854
That's what they just waiting for

52:58.855 --> 53:00.813
and we're gonna sit
back on it for awhile

53:00.814 --> 53:01.822
let 'em sweat on it.

53:02.127 --> 53:03.054
Yo, we gotta talk.

53:03.430 --> 53:04.050
Hold on.

53:05.177 --> 53:08.366
I mean, he got to come out on his corners,
that's how he make money, right ?

53:08.402 --> 53:10.585
We gonna see who got
the bigger war chest. Avon.

53:21.439 --> 53:23.032
Straight to the mattresses, huh ?

53:23.244 --> 53:24.546
Whatever, what you want, man ?

53:24.558 --> 53:26.166
War, man, we're past this bullshit.

53:26.506 --> 53:27.936
Oh yeah, I forgot.

53:28.416 --> 53:29.956
I knew I forgot something.

53:30.062 --> 53:31.083
We the Trump brothers.

53:31.810 --> 53:33.161
You don't give this shit up

53:33.710 --> 53:35.858
you're gonna turn
everything we built to shit.

53:36.174 --> 53:36.808
Naw.

53:38.028 --> 53:39.728
The chump brothers.

53:41.601 --> 53:43.771
You know what the difference's
between me and you ?

53:43.783 --> 53:44.849
I bleed red

53:45.319 --> 53:46.269
you bleed green.

53:46.866 --> 53:48.265
What you been building for us ?

53:49.168 --> 53:51.267
I look at you these days
you know what I see ?

53:51.512 --> 53:52.968
I see a man without a country.

53:54.104 --> 53:55.912
Not hard enough for this right here

53:55.970 --> 53:58.245
and maybe, just maybe

53:58.375 --> 54:00.416
not smart enough
for them out there.

54:00.476 --> 54:01.484
Not hard enough.

54:01.799 --> 54:02.738
No offense.

54:02.808 --> 54:04.486
I don't think you ever really were.

54:05.145 --> 54:07.632
You got skills, yeah,
no doubt, but... what ?

54:08.662 --> 54:10.597
What, 'cause I don't
shoot up a block

54:10.868 --> 54:12.603
indiscriminate I ain't hard enough ?

54:13.687 --> 54:15.081
Huh ? Because I think

54:16.021 --> 54:18.356
before I snatch a life,
I ain't into this bullshit ?

54:18.918 --> 54:19.680
Snatch a life.

54:21.664 --> 54:22.896
What life you snatch, huh ?

54:30.519 --> 54:33.286
You know Brianna went downtown,
man, saw that detective.

54:34.693 --> 54:38.600
Man stokin' her head sayin' that
D'Angelo's death was no suicide.

54:40.146 --> 54:41.366
Yeah, so...

54:43.395 --> 54:44.673
Man ain't wrong about that.

54:49.414 --> 54:49.718
What ?

54:55.618 --> 54:57.027
I knew you couldn't do it

54:58.552 --> 55:00.194
and Brianna wouldn't do that shit.

55:03.586 --> 55:05.966
But there goes a life
that had to be snatched, Avon.

55:19.809 --> 55:22.332
Yo man, I took that shit off you
and put it on me, man

55:22.354 --> 55:24.901
because that motherfucker
was out of pocket with that shit !

55:24.936 --> 55:26.720
20 years above his fucking head.

55:27.338 --> 55:29.789
He flip, man, they got you,
me and fucking Brianna !

55:29.801 --> 55:31.244
And no fucking way, man.

55:31.421 --> 55:32.135
Hell no !

55:32.768 --> 55:34.669
Now, I know you family.

55:35.009 --> 55:35.948
You loved that nigger.

55:35.970 --> 55:38.680
But you want to talk that blood
is thicker than water bullshit

55:38.702 --> 55:40.380
take that shit
somewhere else, nigger !

55:40.403 --> 55:41.941
That motherfucker woulda taken down

55:41.964 --> 55:44.181
the whole fucking show
starting with you, killer !

55:46.447 --> 55:48.874
It's fucking everything
and everybody !

55:55.524 --> 55:56.194
Let me up.

56:04.133 --> 56:04.672
Let me up.

56:10.900 --> 56:11.505
Shit.
