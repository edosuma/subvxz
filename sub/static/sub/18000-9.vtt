WEBVTT

00:02.033 --> 00:03.733
Hey, you know what
I was thinking about?

00:03.734 --> 00:06.234
What if we could put a bunch
of superheroes, like,

00:06.235 --> 00:08.335
into a house, like on
those reality shows,

00:08.336 --> 00:10.436
and uh, see all the drama
that goes on?

00:10.437 --> 00:12.437
Which superheroes would you
put on the house?

00:12.438 --> 00:14.338
You do yours first,
give me time to think.

00:14.339 --> 00:15.939
Tony Stark,
he's an alcoholic.

00:15.940 --> 00:18.440
Then you're talking about
like Superhero Rehab,

00:18.441 --> 00:21.541
not...
Superhero in the House.

00:21.542 --> 00:23.642
Allright, we're gonna like,
like, females.

00:23.643 --> 00:25.243
See their tension, the drama.

00:25.244 --> 00:26.744
- Sexual tension?
-Yes.

00:26.745 --> 00:28.245
He's right about that.

00:28.334 --> 00:30.664
The Stash has none
of this drama or sexual tension.

00:30.698 --> 00:31.998
That's what you think.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.301
You haven't been keeping a close
enough eye on those two.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.669
Did you know
they installed a hot tub

00:35.703 --> 00:37.137
Downstairs
in the storage room?

00:37.171 --> 00:38.472
Who? Me and Mike?

00:38.506 --> 00:40.374
Yeah.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.909
All right.

00:41.943 --> 00:43.933
Well, you know, obviously,
you've been thinking about this.

00:43.968 --> 00:45.436
This is your great idea.

00:45.470 --> 00:46.933
Who is the perfect female
for this idea?

00:46.968 --> 00:48.570
Oh, I've got to pick them?
Oh, man.

00:48.604 --> 00:50.606
How about, like,
Harley Quinn and Power Girl?

00:50.640 --> 00:51.742
Oh.

00:51.789 --> 00:52.756
- All right, I like that.
- Do you like that?

00:52.804 --> 00:53.826
- I like that.
- You like that?

00:53.860 --> 00:56.325
Lot of drama there.
Lot of tension...

00:56.359 --> 00:59.278
Trying to one-up each other,
scantily clad outfits.

00:59.312 --> 01:00.359
Look at him.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.192
- Right.
- Like this is real.

01:02.227 --> 01:05.290
He's about to fly off
that stool, man.

01:05.325 --> 01:06.694
I like this.

01:06.728 --> 01:07.976
It looks like you're ready
to go down in the basement

01:08.010 --> 01:09.477
And jump in that hot tub
right now.

01:11.042 --> 01:13.316
Power girl, I mean mike,
come on.

01:22.678 --> 01:26.678

01:49.648 --> 01:52.660
Hello and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,

01:52.694 --> 01:54.828
The only show
that believes that Clark

01:54.863 --> 01:56.497
could have saved
Kevin Costner from that twister.

01:56.532 --> 01:58.570
I'm Kevin Smith.

01:58.604 --> 02:00.209
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

02:00.243 --> 02:01.614
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

02:01.648 --> 02:03.586
All right, now,
all you guys are in the know,

02:03.620 --> 02:06.126
But only Walt knows everything.
What's going on this week?

02:06.160 --> 02:08.029
It took a customer
coming in

02:08.064 --> 02:11.037
To spark
a pretty good idea I had.

02:15.705 --> 02:17.542
Hey.
What can we do for you today?

02:17.576 --> 02:19.613
Hi. Yeah, I was looking
for a gift for my dad.

02:19.647 --> 02:21.482
He's a big Superman fan.

02:21.517 --> 02:24.492
What are we looking for,
we looking for Superman comics,

02:24.526 --> 02:27.931
Superman hardcover,
Superman statue, action figure?

02:27.965 --> 02:30.498
Probably some kind
of rare item, maybe like...

02:30.532 --> 02:31.633
You want something
on the rare side.

02:31.667 --> 02:33.405
- On the rare side.
- All right.

02:33.439 --> 02:35.244
Want to go grab that Clark Kent
figure from the back?

02:35.278 --> 02:36.247
Yeah,
the one in the glass, yeah.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.381
Wait until you check this out.

02:43.792 --> 02:47.635
May I, Ming?
You ever see this?

02:47.669 --> 02:49.471
- The Chemtoys Clark Kent figure.
- No.

02:49.506 --> 02:51.575
You can tell back then
that toy companies...

02:51.609 --> 02:52.578
Weren't concerned
with the likeness.

02:52.612 --> 02:54.015
Yeah.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.586
It's almost like the president
of Chemtoys was like...

02:55.621 --> 02:58.088
[deep breath]
"Good enough."

02:58.123 --> 02:59.822
[laughter]

02:59.857 --> 03:01.527
You have to forgive Chemtoys

03:01.562 --> 03:04.497
Because it was in the birth
of the action figure.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.766
They hadn't gotten
sculpting down right yet.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.871
It was the infancy of figures,
and thank God

03:09.906 --> 03:11.476
It came on a blister card
with a picture

03:11.510 --> 03:13.079
Of what Superman
really looks like,

03:13.113 --> 03:14.617
Or else you wouldn't know what...
[laughter]

03:14.651 --> 03:16.752
Yeah, like, what is this?
That's that? Okay.

03:16.787 --> 03:17.921
[laughter]

03:17.955 --> 03:19.290
How old's dad
going to be this year?

03:19.324 --> 03:21.661
My dad is going to be 75,
and the cool thing is

03:21.695 --> 03:24.100
It's also
Superman's 75th birthday.

03:24.134 --> 03:26.538
Oh, my God, that's right.

03:26.572 --> 03:28.006
So that's pretty cool.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.774
Your dad and Superman,
born the same year.

03:29.808 --> 03:31.109
Same year.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.111
Dude, you're looking
at Superbaby right here.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.380
[laughter]

03:33.414 --> 03:35.449
Look at that.

03:35.483 --> 03:38.221
This is definitely the gift.

03:38.255 --> 03:39.724
Definitely interested.

03:39.758 --> 03:41.628
Are you stuck on $150?

03:41.663 --> 03:42.697
Why, what are you
looking to spend?

03:42.732 --> 03:43.700
I'm looking to spend
about $50.

03:43.734 --> 03:45.671
$50? Wow.

03:45.705 --> 03:46.872
They call that a super insult.

03:46.906 --> 03:48.607
[laughter]

03:48.642 --> 03:50.179
I can see
where you're going.

03:50.213 --> 03:51.715
I can see what kind
of price range we're looking at.

03:51.749 --> 03:54.118
I can see where dad stands.

03:54.152 --> 03:56.590
You're looking for, like,
a super button for a dollar,

03:56.624 --> 03:57.859
It seems like.

03:57.893 --> 03:59.259
He would appreciate
the button, but you know,

03:59.294 --> 04:01.262
It is his 75th birthday,
so I really

04:01.296 --> 04:03.031
Want to get him
something special.

04:03.065 --> 04:04.801
Would you be willing
to do $80?

04:04.835 --> 04:06.636
$80. Oh.

04:06.670 --> 04:08.605
No, there's not
a chance, man.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.443
The dead lowest price
I could let this go for

04:10.477 --> 04:12.012
Is a buck and a quarter.

04:12.046 --> 04:15.616
And I'll throw the pin in too.

04:15.651 --> 04:17.653
I'll do it.

04:17.687 --> 04:19.822
- You'll do it? All right, man.
- Yeah, thanks.

04:19.858 --> 04:23.026
All right, man,
$5 is your change.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.461
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:24.495 --> 04:25.829
Hey, wish your dad a happy
birthday from us at the Stash.

04:25.864 --> 04:26.897
I will.
Thank you very much.

04:26.932 --> 04:27.899
A pleasure doing
business with you.

04:27.933 --> 04:28.901
- Thank you.
- He'll love it.

04:28.935 --> 04:29.903
See you later.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.104
Wow, you know what?

04:31.139 --> 04:32.238
I almost forgot
it was Superman's birthday.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.173
That guy's got me thinking,
though.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.308
I know we've had birthday
parties here in the past

04:35.343 --> 04:36.310
That didn't go so well.

04:36.345 --> 04:38.348
[children screaming]

04:38.382 --> 04:40.149
Ahh!

04:40.184 --> 04:41.384
What if this time
we did it right, though?

04:41.418 --> 04:43.686
- And we didn't invite kids.
- Okay.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.953
And we have this, like,
super extravaganza.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.354
You know?

04:48.388 --> 04:50.624
Like, we make it, like, we build
it up, we invite our customers,

04:50.659 --> 04:52.892
Maybe we even get
some local media press,

04:52.926 --> 04:55.425
You know, we get it
in the paper, you know.

04:55.459 --> 04:58.028
A party for superman
on his 75th birthday.

04:58.063 --> 05:00.030
I think we should... I think
we should even go all out...

05:00.065 --> 05:02.194
Like us at the Stash
go all out

05:02.228 --> 05:03.893
And dress
in Superman costumes.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.763
So, like, all of us will be
wearing tights and capes?

05:05.797 --> 05:07.265
Not superman costumes.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.068
Because we're not just
celebrating Superman's birthday,

05:09.102 --> 05:10.436
We're celebrating
Superman history.

05:10.470 --> 05:12.971
And that history includes
all those other characters

05:13.006 --> 05:14.640
That make up
Superman's universe.

05:14.674 --> 05:18.579
Costumes, decorations,
party food.

05:18.613 --> 05:20.145
A hundred middle-aged men
crammed in here,

05:20.177 --> 05:21.176
Dressed in tights.

05:21.210 --> 05:22.442
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

05:22.476 --> 05:23.944
Sounds like a good time.

05:23.979 --> 05:26.016
All right, so, okay, I'm gonna
put you on the decorations.

05:26.050 --> 05:27.250
Okay, I'm good
at decorations.

05:27.284 --> 05:29.351
- Mike, you know food.
- Food.

05:29.386 --> 05:30.787
You're the chef.

05:30.822 --> 05:34.328
I want you to make us
some super hors d'oeuvres.

05:34.362 --> 05:38.766
Whew, that is fancy.
[laughter]

05:38.800 --> 05:40.568
Wow, you even
pronounced it right.

05:40.603 --> 05:43.170
Very impressive.
That was impressive.

05:43.202 --> 05:46.869
I'm gonna try
to maybe secure

05:46.904 --> 05:48.537
A super guest.

05:48.572 --> 05:51.807
I want to have somebody in here
that will blow you all away,

05:51.841 --> 05:53.775
- That will blow your doors off.
- I am in.

05:53.810 --> 05:55.178
I'm always up for a party.

05:55.212 --> 05:57.814
All right, let's do this, man.
For Superman.

05:57.849 --> 05:59.314
For Superman.

05:59.349 --> 06:01.282
I called
about the Lois Lane comic book.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.752
Yes! Yes.

06:02.787 --> 06:05.090
- Ooh.
- We put it aside for you.

06:05.124 --> 06:06.090
I'm so excited.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.658
I mean, this is
your only chance

06:07.693 --> 06:09.827
To have this go home
with a black woman.

06:11.702 --> 06:13.103
All right, you know
I brought you guys here today

06:13.137 --> 06:17.041
To get the current status
of the Superman birthday party.

06:17.076 --> 06:18.276
Where are we at?

06:18.310 --> 06:19.543
I got the invitations
printed up.

06:19.578 --> 06:20.545
Check them out right here.

06:20.579 --> 06:22.581
Wow.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.583
Looks good, right?

06:23.617 --> 06:25.050
Look at this paper, man.

06:25.084 --> 06:28.185
This is absolutely,
definitely high end.

06:28.219 --> 06:30.956
Great job.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.493
All right, so, Mike,
what about you?

06:32.527 --> 06:35.065
I got... I'm working
on the hors d'oeuvres.

06:35.099 --> 06:37.434
I've got the cake ordered,
and I've got

06:37.468 --> 06:40.605
The perfect super punch
for this thing.

06:40.639 --> 06:43.641
And, bryan,
you have done what?

06:43.675 --> 06:46.610
I haven't eaten in the last
48 hours to save my appetite.

06:46.644 --> 06:49.715
[laughter]
for all the hors d'oeuvres.

06:49.749 --> 06:51.083
What about you?

06:51.117 --> 06:52.085
What about
this secret celebrity guest

06:52.119 --> 06:53.086
That you said
you were getting?

06:53.120 --> 06:55.121
- It's coming.
- Really?

06:55.155 --> 06:56.289
It's coming.

06:56.323 --> 06:58.493
[whispers] it's me.
[laughter]

06:58.527 --> 06:59.897
I mean,
that's what I expect.

06:59.932 --> 07:01.166
Where did you get
a celebrity guest?

07:01.200 --> 07:02.301
It sounds like you're...

07:02.335 --> 07:03.568
It sounds a hint of doubt
in that voice.

07:03.602 --> 07:05.267
Yeah, I mean, a little bit.

07:05.302 --> 07:08.404
I mean, like... I mean, you're not
entrenched with all these...

07:08.439 --> 07:09.738
These celebrity things.

07:09.772 --> 07:11.639
[grunting]

07:11.673 --> 07:13.941
I'm telling you,
I got a guest,

07:13.975 --> 07:16.777
And it's going to be super, and
you're going to crap yourself.

07:16.812 --> 07:17.979
Again.

07:18.013 --> 07:20.215
- [chuckles]
- It's going to be awesome.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.783
Super party of the season.

07:21.818 --> 07:26.321
That's what I want
to hear, baby.

07:28.557 --> 07:30.325
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

07:30.360 --> 07:32.360
I called
about the Lois Lane comic book.

07:32.395 --> 07:33.794
Yes! Yes.

07:33.829 --> 07:36.095
- Ooh.
- We put it aside for you.

07:36.129 --> 07:37.128
I'm so excited.

07:37.162 --> 07:38.528
<i>Lois Lane</i> 106.

07:38.563 --> 07:41.730
Lois lane turns
into a black woman.

07:49.542 --> 07:52.678
I'm a huge Superman fan, and
so when I read about this one,

07:52.712 --> 07:54.112
I had to get my hands on it.

07:54.147 --> 07:55.347
So Lois Lane switches from
white to black in this issue.

07:55.381 --> 07:56.714
Yes.

07:56.748 --> 08:00.018
Superman just happens to have
this kryptonian machine,

08:00.052 --> 08:02.684
Which can turn her
from white to black.

08:02.719 --> 08:04.853
It was called a plastimold.

08:04.887 --> 08:06.954
We have them on Earth.
They're called tanning booths.

08:06.988 --> 08:08.389
Yeah.
[laughter]

08:08.423 --> 08:10.592
Lois Lane, one of the world's
greatest journalists,

08:10.626 --> 08:12.293
Was going to see
what it was like

08:12.327 --> 08:13.995
To be a black woman
for 24 hours.

08:14.029 --> 08:16.800
It was intended to be
thought-provoking.

08:16.835 --> 08:19.871
But when you look at it now,
you're like... [groans]

08:19.906 --> 08:21.206
But think about it, though.

08:21.241 --> 08:22.977
Let's say that machine
really existed.

08:23.011 --> 08:27.312
Wouldn't it be great, you know,
if we were forced by Superman...

08:27.347 --> 08:28.779
[laughs]

08:28.813 --> 08:32.618
To spend 24 hours
in somebody else's skin?

08:32.653 --> 08:35.754
I think it would bring
all the ethnicities together

08:35.788 --> 08:38.491
Because we'd all be like,
"We got to stop this Superman

08:38.525 --> 08:41.892
Who keeps forcing us into this
machine like we're sneetches."

08:41.926 --> 08:43.193
But it's awesome.

08:43.227 --> 08:45.631
I mean, being a black woman
that loves comic books,

08:45.666 --> 08:48.635
I mean, we're like
the unicorns of the fanboys.

08:48.670 --> 08:50.002
[laughter]

08:50.037 --> 08:51.437
Another point
that I read about this one

08:51.471 --> 08:55.174
Was that even though she
went through all these changes,

08:55.209 --> 08:56.910
It was still the question of,

08:56.944 --> 08:58.911
"Will Superman still
love me if I'm black?"

08:58.945 --> 09:00.012
[groans]

09:00.046 --> 09:01.013
Like, it always
comes back to that.

09:01.047 --> 09:02.147
That's the full circle.

09:02.181 --> 09:03.448
No matter what she does,
it comes right back to,

09:03.482 --> 09:05.216
"Oh, will he still
love me if I'm this,

09:05.250 --> 09:06.883
If I'm that, if I'm that?"

09:06.918 --> 09:09.185
And I'm like, "you don't get it.
This guy loves you."

09:09.219 --> 09:11.287
This is the thing
that always bugged me the most

09:11.322 --> 09:12.856
About Lois Lane.

09:12.890 --> 09:14.757
She pines over Superman.

09:14.792 --> 09:16.926
But meanwhile Clark's
standing right next to her

09:16.960 --> 09:18.495
As the perfect choice, man.

09:18.529 --> 09:20.397
I never liked
that aspect of her.

09:20.432 --> 09:23.401
But, I mean, in her defense,
I mean, Superman is super sexy.

09:23.435 --> 09:24.803
Yeah, he's dreamy,
but, like, you know...

09:24.837 --> 09:27.905
This is getting super awkward.
[laughter]

09:27.940 --> 09:30.074
So shall I ring you up?

09:30.109 --> 09:33.214
Is there any way I can
get it a little bit cheaper?

09:33.248 --> 09:35.485
I'm thinking, like, $20?

09:35.519 --> 09:38.720
You know what, it's a little
bit better than a $20 book.

09:38.754 --> 09:40.655
How about $25?
Meet in the middle?

09:40.689 --> 09:44.994
Maybe $22?

09:45.028 --> 09:46.529
I mean,
this is your only chance

09:46.563 --> 09:48.031
To have this go home
with a black woman.

09:48.065 --> 09:52.872
How about, just so I can say
I fought really hard, $23?

09:52.906 --> 09:55.874
For your manhood,
for your pride, $23.

09:55.908 --> 09:57.342
You have to admire
his struggle.

09:57.376 --> 09:58.376
[laughter]

09:58.411 --> 10:00.213
His people,
the comic book nerds.

10:00.247 --> 10:02.250
- [laughter]
- Nice wallet.

10:02.284 --> 10:03.853
- Thank you.
- Superman.

10:03.887 --> 10:07.750
I told you I love him.
That's my guy.

10:07.784 --> 10:09.685
He's like Igor.
He's just like... [growls]

10:09.719 --> 10:12.188
- Man, you are awesome, mike.
- "Superman."

10:12.222 --> 10:15.719
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you. Thanks, guys.

10:16.989 --> 10:18.223
How's the crowd looking?

10:18.257 --> 10:19.226
I'm going to go let them in.
Let's go.

10:19.260 --> 10:20.462
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:20.496 --> 10:22.431
No one gets in
until my special guest arrives.

10:22.465 --> 10:26.036
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

10:26.071 --> 10:27.938
Superman!

10:27.972 --> 10:30.072
[cheers and applause]

10:31.287 --> 10:34.189
Which DC universe character
would you like to also see

10:34.223 --> 10:36.628
Put into
a future Superman movie,

10:36.662 --> 10:38.896
And who plays that person?

10:38.930 --> 10:40.696
- Krypto.
- Krypto.

10:40.730 --> 10:42.864
Superman's dog.

10:42.898 --> 10:44.465
Now, does he have a cape
as he does in the comic?

10:44.500 --> 10:46.401
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[laughter]

10:46.436 --> 10:47.937
But doesn't that give away
his identity?

10:47.971 --> 10:50.238
No, they're like, "There's
that idiot 40-year-old guy

10:50.273 --> 10:52.006
Walking his dog with a cape."

10:52.040 --> 10:54.841
[laughter]
no one really suspects.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.146
- What about you Ming-a-ling?
- I would love to see a Bizarro.

10:57.180 --> 10:59.515
- Bizarro Superman.
- That would be good.

10:59.549 --> 11:00.648
- Who plays him?
- I don't know.

11:00.682 --> 11:02.617
For whatever reason,
the name Jon "Hahm."

11:02.652 --> 11:04.890
- Jon "Hahm"?
- Jon "Hahm"?

11:04.924 --> 11:07.058
Yeah, you gotta ugly him up
a little bit,

11:07.093 --> 11:08.527
- You know, Bizarro him.
- Why not just me?

11:08.561 --> 11:10.529
I already look like Bizarro.
Like, give me a chance.

11:10.563 --> 11:12.764
Why does Jon Hamm
get all the breaks?

11:12.798 --> 11:15.903
Or Jon "Hahm," as you say.
[laughter]

11:15.937 --> 11:17.936
What about you, big?

11:17.971 --> 11:20.137
I think I would like
to join Walt in his menagerie,

11:20.171 --> 11:21.639
So I'm gonna go
with comet the horse.

11:21.673 --> 11:23.642
Who's going to play
the horse?

11:23.677 --> 11:26.043
Pick a horse, who cares?
[laughter]

11:26.078 --> 11:27.709
Yeah, but you know
comic book fans, dude.

11:27.743 --> 11:30.511
You pick the wrong horse, they
get all mad like with Batfleck.

11:30.545 --> 11:32.347
They're like, "boo!"

11:32.381 --> 11:33.681
Right, right.

11:33.716 --> 11:35.449
It's Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
in a horse costume...

11:35.484 --> 11:38.217
[laughter]

11:42.980 --> 11:46.045
[indistinct chatter]

11:52.289 --> 11:53.759
Look at this place, man.

11:53.793 --> 11:55.061
You really did it.

11:55.095 --> 11:57.198
- Yeah.
- I mean, it looks incredible.

11:57.232 --> 11:59.036
You did a wonderful job,

11:59.070 --> 12:02.140
But what does raggedy ann
have to do with Superman?

12:02.174 --> 12:04.243
No, I'm Jimmy Olsen,
Superman's best friend.

12:04.278 --> 12:07.449
Everything from the... from
the neck up says raggedy ann.

12:07.484 --> 12:09.683
Everything from the neck down
says Jimmy Olsen, I mean...

12:09.716 --> 12:10.915
This was the only wig
I could find.

12:10.950 --> 12:12.317
Look at Mike, huh?

12:12.352 --> 12:13.320
I mean, if there were a
contest, he would probably win.

12:13.354 --> 12:14.589
Bizarro, huh?

12:14.623 --> 12:16.192
Speak like Bizarro real quick.

12:16.227 --> 12:18.760
Get him, Raggedy Olsen.

12:18.795 --> 12:20.295
It's close enough, come on.

12:20.329 --> 12:21.697
I am not looking
for close enough.

12:21.732 --> 12:23.869
I want perfection tonight.
A la...

12:23.903 --> 12:25.906
Look at him.
For God's sakes, he's Jor-El.

12:25.941 --> 12:27.307
Huh?
Curt Swan Jor-El.

12:27.342 --> 12:28.608
We're talking
about the most important figure

12:28.642 --> 12:30.508
In Superman's life,

12:30.543 --> 12:31.911
The man who sent him to Earth

12:31.946 --> 12:33.414
To become
the world's greatest superhero.

12:33.448 --> 12:34.515
Yes.

12:34.549 --> 12:36.751
Without me,
Superman doesn't exist.

12:36.785 --> 12:41.555
- [laughter]
- Oh, my God.

12:41.590 --> 12:42.556
What are you supposed to be?

12:42.590 --> 12:44.223
Kryptonite.
What do you mean?

12:44.258 --> 12:45.224
[laughter]

12:45.259 --> 12:47.396
Kryptonite is a rock,
not a mushy pea.

12:47.431 --> 12:50.735
Well, it is from my planet,
you know?

12:50.770 --> 12:51.904
You look like
frickin' raggedy ann.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.038
- What are you talking about?
- I told you.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.906
I told you
you looked like raggedy ann.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.775
How's the crowd look
out there?

12:56.809 --> 12:58.310
I don't know. Ming?

12:58.344 --> 12:59.746
All right.
The crowd looks great.

12:59.780 --> 13:00.747
I'm gonna go let them in.
Let's go.

13:00.782 --> 13:01.982
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

13:02.017 --> 13:04.152
No one gets in
until my special guest arrives.

13:04.187 --> 13:07.022
I tasked myself with
the hardest job of all of them.

13:07.057 --> 13:10.596
My job was to secure
a super guest.

13:10.630 --> 13:11.663
Doesn't take a Brainiac
to figure out

13:11.697 --> 13:13.097
Who that might be, man.

13:13.132 --> 13:14.499
It's got to be
one of the Supermans.

13:14.534 --> 13:15.667
Let's do the math.

13:15.702 --> 13:17.666
How many people
have played Superman?

13:17.700 --> 13:20.568
Well, I mean,
you got to leave out

13:20.602 --> 13:21.702
George Reeves,
Christopher Reeve.

13:21.737 --> 13:23.169
They've passed on.

13:23.204 --> 13:25.804
Then you've got Henry Cavill,
who's playing him now.

13:25.838 --> 13:29.439
Brandon Routh,
who was in Superman Returns.

13:29.474 --> 13:33.010
Tom Welling, who played
Superman in Smallville.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.677
And then, I mean...

13:35.710 --> 13:38.477
- Oh, really?
- Oh.

13:38.512 --> 13:40.414
[cheers and applause]

13:40.449 --> 13:43.353
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

13:43.387 --> 13:45.219
Superman!

13:45.253 --> 13:47.721
[cheers and applause]

13:47.755 --> 13:50.159
Dean Cain!

13:50.193 --> 13:54.562
Hi.
How are you?

13:54.596 --> 13:57.896
Look at this.
I like that hair.

13:57.931 --> 14:00.097
- That's his natural hair color.
- Fantastic.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.265
Are you able to shake my hand?

14:01.299 --> 14:03.568
I can.
I'm not in costume.

14:03.603 --> 14:04.705
But if I didn't,

14:04.739 --> 14:05.707
Then the kryptonite
would definitely get me.

14:05.741 --> 14:06.942
Ahh, see?

14:06.976 --> 14:08.843
This I see this
in the mirror every morning.

14:08.877 --> 14:10.144
Well done.

14:10.178 --> 14:12.311
Let's get inside
and get this party started.

14:12.345 --> 14:13.511
- Let's do.
- All right.

14:13.546 --> 14:14.546
Hi, everybody.
How you guys doing?

14:14.580 --> 14:18.082
[cheers and applause]
All right.

14:22.722 --> 14:25.992
How you doing?
Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

14:26.026 --> 14:27.293
[indistinct chatter]

14:27.328 --> 14:28.295
Really?

14:28.329 --> 14:30.332
It's the real deal.

14:30.366 --> 14:31.567
[laughs]

14:31.601 --> 14:33.703
Hey, guys.
Hold up a second. Real quick.

14:33.738 --> 14:35.639
Can I get
everybody's attention?

14:35.674 --> 14:37.841
I just want to thank everybody
for coming out

14:37.875 --> 14:40.839
And helping us celebrate
75 years of Superman.

14:40.873 --> 14:44.377
[cheers and applause]

14:47.447 --> 14:48.780
Joining us here tonight
to help celebrate

14:48.814 --> 14:52.449
75 years of Superman
is Mr. Dean Cain.

14:52.484 --> 14:55.585
[cheers and applause]

14:55.620 --> 14:59.953
I don't feel a day
over 40-something.

14:59.988 --> 15:01.689
Dean Cain.

15:01.723 --> 15:03.992
Dean Cain was carrying
the flag for Superman

15:04.026 --> 15:07.296
When nobody cared
about superman anymore,

15:07.331 --> 15:11.201
Turned that into a number one
show about Superman.

15:11.235 --> 15:14.338
It was called Lois & clark:
The New Adventures of Superman.

15:14.372 --> 15:15.605
And he was great.

15:15.640 --> 15:19.410
He was a really charming
and bright-eyed Clark Kent,

15:19.444 --> 15:22.347
And he cut a dashing figure
as Superman.

15:22.382 --> 15:26.451
And if you summoned Superman,
then you're Jimmy Olsen.

15:26.486 --> 15:28.254
- Not this guy.
- [laughs]

15:28.288 --> 15:30.191
I'm Jimmy, Jor-El,
all wrapped in one.

15:30.226 --> 15:32.461
Jimmy Jor-El,
that's Walt's new rap name.

15:32.495 --> 15:34.962
[laughter]

15:34.996 --> 15:37.229
For me, it was the greatest
start to a career ever,

15:37.264 --> 15:39.602
And I loved playing the role.

15:39.636 --> 15:41.570
I think it's fun to be
associated with the character.

15:41.604 --> 15:45.242
That's why I'm here now,
and that's it.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.510
So thank you guys
for being here.

15:46.545 --> 15:47.977
Anybody have any questions?

15:48.011 --> 15:50.942
Because I'm happy to answer
any questions if you have them.

15:50.977 --> 15:52.442
Way in the back.

15:52.476 --> 15:54.373
Yeah, what's the...
what's the strangest gift

15:54.407 --> 15:57.239
You've ever gotten
from a superman fan?

15:57.273 --> 15:58.239
I would get like...
it wasn't gifts, though.

15:58.274 --> 15:59.506
It was like...

15:59.540 --> 16:01.005
I got some things that were
actually kind of scary.

16:01.039 --> 16:02.841
I got, like, contemplations...

16:02.875 --> 16:04.176
People like, you know,
"You're the only one

16:04.211 --> 16:05.645
Who can talk to my son,
Superman," and things like that.

16:05.679 --> 16:06.747
So it was actually
kind of scary.

16:06.781 --> 16:08.350
Hey, my dad
apologized for that.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.653
- [laughter]
- Your dad did say he was sorry.

16:10.686 --> 16:12.886
I got... I got grocery lists.

16:12.921 --> 16:14.555
"Would you please
get us some groceries?"

16:14.589 --> 16:16.626
And "these are the ones."

16:16.660 --> 16:19.664
I apologize for that.
[laughter]

16:19.698 --> 16:21.165
But then I made the comment...
I made the comment

16:21.200 --> 16:24.035
That, like, I hadn't gotten
any panties sent in the mail.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.871
And guess what
I got in the mail.

16:25.905 --> 16:27.973
[clapping]
Panties in the mail.

16:28.007 --> 16:29.575
- [laughter]
- Yeah.

16:29.609 --> 16:30.642
All you got to do is ask,
right?

16:30.677 --> 16:31.777
Yeah, you got to ask,
that's it.

16:31.811 --> 16:33.746
- Anybody else?
- Regarding Teri Hatcher...

16:33.780 --> 16:35.881
Were they real,
and were they spectacular?

16:35.916 --> 16:38.951
[laughter]

16:38.985 --> 16:41.787
That's a very
good question, sir.

16:41.822 --> 16:43.623
Uh...

16:43.657 --> 16:45.993
Happy birthday.
Huh?

16:46.027 --> 16:47.696
That's cool.
I did not expect this.

16:47.730 --> 16:48.698
[applause]

16:48.732 --> 16:51.434
And it is... oh!
Outstanding.

16:56.648 --> 16:57.716
Anybody else?

16:57.750 --> 16:58.951
Regarding Teri Hatcher...

16:58.986 --> 17:01.887
Were they real,
and were they spectacular?

17:01.922 --> 17:04.089
[laughter]

17:04.123 --> 17:06.691
That's a very
good question, sir.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.393
Uh...

17:08.428 --> 17:10.464
I'm going to answer that
with one answer.

17:10.498 --> 17:13.102
Yes.
[cheers and applause]

17:13.136 --> 17:14.470
Dean Cain!

17:14.503 --> 17:16.740
Yes, they were.

17:16.773 --> 17:18.208
Anybody else?

17:18.242 --> 17:21.143
Like, when you're getting
changed in the phone booth,

17:21.176 --> 17:23.345
How do you deal
with the smell of hobo urine?

17:23.378 --> 17:25.247
[laughter]

17:25.281 --> 17:26.747
Yes, that's where super senses
are not so great.

17:26.781 --> 17:29.084
- Yeah, right?
- Fortunately, you know what?

17:29.118 --> 17:32.154
Even by the time we did that...
we were 1993 to 1997...

17:32.188 --> 17:34.955
There were almost
no phone booths around.

17:34.990 --> 17:37.858
And now, if I say something,
like, to my son who's 13...

17:37.893 --> 17:39.326
If I say, "Hey, you know,
he would change

17:39.360 --> 17:40.527
In a phone booth
or something."

17:40.561 --> 17:42.061
He's like,
"What's a phone booth?

17:42.096 --> 17:43.263
Why wouldn't you use
a cell phone?"

17:43.297 --> 17:45.533
[laughter]

17:45.568 --> 17:48.104
All right, well, if there's
no more questions,

17:48.138 --> 17:49.571
We'd like to take
this opportunity

17:49.606 --> 17:52.674
To present to you a gift.

17:52.709 --> 17:54.143
All right.

17:54.177 --> 17:56.110
We can't give Superman
a birthday gift today,

17:56.144 --> 17:59.444
But we can give mr. Dean Cain,
who played Superman,

17:59.479 --> 18:02.312
A birthday gift, and that's what
we'd like to do right now.

18:02.347 --> 18:04.045
In honor of my 75th.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.243
No.
[laughter]

18:05.278 --> 18:06.244
Oh!

18:06.278 --> 18:07.245
There you go.
Happy birthday.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.182
- Outstanding.
- Huh?

18:09.217 --> 18:12.251
That's cool.
I did not expect this.

18:12.285 --> 18:13.384
That's kind of awesome.

18:13.418 --> 18:14.417
Can I... can I open it?

18:14.452 --> 18:15.887
- Yeah, open it up.
- Open it up.

18:15.922 --> 18:18.589
So we present Mr. Dean Cain

18:18.623 --> 18:20.688
With a present
from the Stash.

18:20.722 --> 18:23.191
He opens it up,
and I got to admit

18:23.225 --> 18:25.426
Even he was stunned
at what he got.

18:25.461 --> 18:28.458
It is a card...

18:28.492 --> 18:30.827
From Jay and Silent Bob's
Secret Stash,

18:30.861 --> 18:33.464
And it is...

18:33.498 --> 18:36.236
A $100 gift certificate.

18:36.370 --> 18:38.737
[cheers and applause]

18:38.772 --> 18:40.006
100 bucks.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.843
- No. Really?
- Yeah.

18:41.878 --> 18:43.244
We were all stunned.
[laughter]

18:43.278 --> 18:45.677
I'm sure he's like,
"I'm never coming back."

18:45.711 --> 18:46.844
[laughter]

18:46.879 --> 18:49.750
- Thank you.
- Who wants to have some cake?

18:49.784 --> 18:51.184
[cheers and applause]
Cake!

18:51.218 --> 18:52.918
Mr. Cain,
would you do us the honor

18:52.953 --> 18:54.153
Of, like, cutting
the first piece of cake?

18:54.187 --> 18:55.753
Cutting the cake.
Okay, I will cut the cake.

18:55.787 --> 18:58.490
- Absolutely.
- All right.

18:58.525 --> 19:02.729
[cheers and applause]
all right.

19:02.764 --> 19:05.804
That's a beautiful cake.

19:05.838 --> 19:08.041
There's kryptonite on it.
I shall start cutting.

19:08.075 --> 19:11.477
Here we go.

19:11.511 --> 19:13.579
I asked Dean if he would
do us the honors,

19:13.614 --> 19:16.281
And he went over there
and just cut through that cake

19:16.315 --> 19:19.216
Almost like
as if he had heat vision.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.384
- [chuckles]
- The honor was the 1st piece,

19:20.418 --> 19:23.221
The 5th piece,
the 20th piece...

19:23.255 --> 19:24.789
He wouldn't, like,
give him a break.

19:24.823 --> 19:26.959
- He made him cut the whole cake.
- Well, I felt, like, awkward...

19:26.993 --> 19:28.127
Why aren't you
doing it super fast?

19:28.161 --> 19:29.128
[laughter]

19:29.162 --> 19:30.463
My pleasure.

19:30.497 --> 19:33.368
Yes, sir, you got it.
There you go, brother.

19:33.402 --> 19:35.002
I'll cut them
as fast as I can.

19:35.036 --> 19:36.669
I guess I'm going
to cut all of them.

19:36.702 --> 19:39.403
There it is.

19:39.437 --> 19:41.439
Walt, do I just keep cutting?

19:41.473 --> 19:42.640
Keep going.
Keep cutting, Dean.

19:42.675 --> 19:43.909
All right.

19:43.943 --> 19:45.176
My thinking was
you get served

19:45.210 --> 19:47.442
A piece of cake by Superman
at a Superman party,

19:47.477 --> 19:49.778
You're going to take that
to your freaking grave.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.114
Yeah, that's true.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.451
So everybody at that party,
I wanted the privilege

19:53.485 --> 19:57.319
And the memory of being served
cake by Superman.

19:57.353 --> 19:59.621
I figure that's what
I'll think about on my deathbed.

19:59.655 --> 20:01.758
[laughter]

20:01.792 --> 20:04.027
Dean freaking Cain
is here, man.

20:04.061 --> 20:06.064
Yeah, yeah.

20:06.099 --> 20:08.935
In the history of the Stash,
where does this rank

20:08.970 --> 20:10.971
In the all-time greatest days
at the stash?

20:11.006 --> 20:12.139
Oh, it's got to be
up at the top.

20:12.174 --> 20:15.910
You know what,
we owe it all to Superman.

20:15.944 --> 20:17.311
- We do.
- Hell, yeah.

20:17.346 --> 20:18.981
Happy birthday, Superman.

20:19.015 --> 20:20.517
Happy birthday.

20:20.551 --> 20:21.751
It's good to hear that a guy

20:21.785 --> 20:23.386
That wrapped himself up
in the colors of Superman

20:23.420 --> 20:26.691
Still seems to live
by the Superman code.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.226
He's got time for everybody,

20:28.260 --> 20:30.996
He's shaking hands,
he's answering questions.

20:31.031 --> 20:33.233
I mean, the fact
that he even came is pretty...

20:33.267 --> 20:35.233
That's a pretty Superman thing
to do.

20:35.267 --> 20:38.839
You wear that cape,
you have a standard to uphold,

20:38.873 --> 20:40.808
And I'm here
to say that Dean Cain

20:40.842 --> 20:44.776
Is upholding that standard
to the tenth degree.

20:44.810 --> 20:47.379
Nice. And just like
a birthday present,

20:47.414 --> 20:48.780
That's gonna wrap it up
for Comic Book Men.

20:48.814 --> 20:49.781
I'm Kevin Smith.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.449
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.984
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.087
Remember, kids,
if someone asks if you're a God,

20:55.122 --> 20:56.554
You say yes.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.254
Good night.
