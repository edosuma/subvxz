WEBVTT

00:28.111 --> 00:31.865
OK, if movies have taught me anything,
it's that all dogs are good at basketball.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.826
Oh, come on, Johnny, not all dogs are--

00:34.909 --> 00:36.661
Somersault slam!

00:38.288 --> 00:41.124
OK, it's true. We're awesome.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.084
And that's why you gotta help me.

00:43.168 --> 00:47.297
It's basketball week in gym,
and everybody laughs cos I stink.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.548
Oh, you're not that bad.

00:48.631 --> 00:51.676
Now, just focus on that rim and sink it!

00:52.302 --> 00:54.637


00:56.055 --> 00:57.432
-

01:01.478 --> 01:05.106
-Sorry.
-You are a terrible coach!

01:05.899 --> 01:07.484
Help me get better at basketball!

01:07.567 --> 01:08.651
We're busy.

01:08.735 --> 01:12.072
Come on!
Invent me some Jam-slam sneakers

01:12.155 --> 01:14.074
or GPS shooting gloves!

01:14.157 --> 01:18.161
Johnny, we don't have time
because we're studying string theory.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.455
Not cool. But you know what<i> is</i> cool?

01:20.538 --> 01:23.416
Inventing mega-hands so I can block shots

01:23.500 --> 01:26.169
or slap Hoops McGee
when he makes fun of me!

01:26.252 --> 01:28.463
Attracting positive vibrations
throughout matter

01:28.546 --> 01:31.341
by amplifying them
in a single transponder…

01:34.677 --> 01:36.805
…is very cool.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.390
And now in English, please?

01:39.474 --> 01:44.729
You two are looking at the world's first
and fully functional good luck charm.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.941
That could turn Johnny's unlucky bounces
into lucky baskets!

01:48.024 --> 01:51.736
The vibrational waves are
too unpredictable for testing, Johnny.

01:51.820 --> 01:56.199
And if you even think of stealing it,
you're in for a…

01:57.617 --> 01:58.910
…shock.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.871
Well, we gave it a shot…

02:08.378 --> 02:09.963
Last week was gymnastics week.

02:10.046 --> 02:11.464
-Hyah!

02:11.548 --> 02:13.174
And karate week was before that.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.053
How are you so good at karate
and gymnastics,

02:17.137 --> 02:19.597
but so bad at basketball?

02:19.681 --> 02:22.308
A question I've asked myself many times.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.644
Now walk me to school, dog!

02:25.728 --> 02:29.399
I've got a bad feeling
about you stealing a good luck charm.

02:29.482 --> 02:33.403
One, it's not stealing if I get it back
before Susan and Mary get home.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.281
-And two, where's the good luck?

02:38.408 --> 02:39.534
Look out!

02:43.663 --> 02:45.582
Ooh, those are ice-pops!

02:45.665 --> 02:47.584
Don't you mean Good Luck-sicles?

02:47.667 --> 02:49.919
-Num!

02:50.003 --> 02:52.088
And tell your grumble-tummy
to relax and eat.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.339
That wasn't my stomach.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.303
That was psycho Dobermans!

03:00.471 --> 03:03.057
OK, where's the good luck now?

03:07.937 --> 03:09.480
Ha! It works!

03:09.564 --> 03:12.191
So, how's that "bad feeling" feel now?

03:12.275 --> 03:15.486
Let's just say, I'm gonna keep
an eye on you in gym today,

03:15.570 --> 03:17.447
and on these Good Luck-sicles.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.489
Heh heh.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.622
All right, class, it's basketball week!

03:25.705 --> 03:27.123
You know what that means?

03:28.458 --> 03:31.628
We make fun of Johnny all week
cos he stinks?

03:33.087 --> 03:34.339
That's right, Hoops!

03:34.422 --> 03:36.716
OK, let's play ball and laugh at Johnny.

03:41.137 --> 03:44.182
-So, still feeling lucky?
-We're about to find out.

03:44.265 --> 03:47.101
Hey, Test… Shoot it!

03:54.234 --> 03:55.193
Huh?

03:55.860 --> 03:57.779
Yes! I made a basket!

03:57.862 --> 04:01.282
Well, I bet you can't do that again!

04:03.701 --> 04:05.995
Test! How are you doing that?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.581
Oh, I don't know. Just lucky, I guess.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.794
Your luck can't last forever, Test.

04:12.877 --> 04:16.089
Oh, I bet it lasts all week.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.394
Test! The State Championship game
is tonight,

05:11.477 --> 05:13.521
and I'm moving you from gym class

05:13.604 --> 05:17.150
to my star shooter
on the Boys' Middle School Team.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.319
But I'm your star shooter.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.070
-Not anymore.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.780
What do you say, Test?

05:25.366 --> 05:28.202
"Johnny Test to play
in Championship Tonight!"

05:28.286 --> 05:31.706
You see that, dog?
I'm a serious baller now.

05:31.789 --> 05:33.833
-Do you see that?

05:33.916 --> 05:35.168
Johnny!

05:35.251 --> 05:36.878
You're in serious trouble now.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.963
Uh, why are you not in school?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.298
We are.

05:40.381 --> 05:44.719
We're field-testing Porkbelly's
abnormal seismological activity.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.804
And we should have known
you were behind it,

05:46.888 --> 05:48.931
because you stole the lucky charm!

05:52.143 --> 05:54.729
OK, it can't be called stealing
if you bring it back.

05:54.812 --> 05:58.608
Well, what is it called when you're going
around town causing horrible luck?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.943
What? It's causing great luck.

06:01.027 --> 06:06.449
Yeah. We found boxes of super-fun stuff,
escaped two psycho Dobermans…

06:06.532 --> 06:09.702
And I made the basketball team!

06:09.786 --> 06:12.705
And did you read any of the other stories?

06:12.789 --> 06:16.542
"Local delivery drivers fired
for losing boxes of fun stuff."

06:17.043 --> 06:21.506
"Sad Pet Owner pleads, 'Help me find
my lovable Dobermans.'"

06:22.215 --> 06:24.217
And what about this one?

06:24.300 --> 06:27.261
"Porkbelly rocked by earthquakes,
and they're getting bigger?"

06:27.345 --> 06:30.932
But for me, the charm caused good luck.
Boy confused.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.850
Super symmetry.

06:32.934 --> 06:36.938
For every vibrational node,
there's a corresponding anti-node.

06:37.021 --> 06:38.439
In English?

06:38.523 --> 06:40.525
Every time you receive good luck,

06:40.608 --> 06:43.194
the universe sends
everything else bad luck.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.368
Didn't you notice the huge cracks
when you used the pendant?

06:50.451 --> 06:54.080
How do you notice the ground
when sweet coats fall from the sky?

06:55.289 --> 06:57.625
OK, I'll stop wearing the charm,

06:57.708 --> 06:59.836
just as soon as I win
the basketball championship.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.675
-Guess again.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.807
I have to wear a<i> bad</i> luck charm?

07:14.267 --> 07:18.438
This way, you will attract
all the universe's negative vibrations.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.649
And reset Porkbelly's seismic balance
with good vibes.

07:21.732 --> 07:25.570
Why does doing the right thing
always feel so wrong?

07:26.696 --> 07:28.531
-Johnny! Johnny!

07:28.614 --> 07:30.533
Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!

07:30.616 --> 07:34.120
Test! With all the bad luck
in town lately,

07:34.203 --> 07:38.458
Porkbelly needs you to bring them
the one thing they truly need.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.377
I know, I know. Seismic balance.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.006
No. That shiny championship trophy.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.134
Now, go get 'em!

07:49.177 --> 07:52.388
All Johnny has to do
is wear the bad luck charm…

07:52.472 --> 07:55.892
Until all the cracks are gone
and the town is safe again.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.275
Oh, this is not gonna go well.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.616
Test! That was the wrong hoop!

08:26.172 --> 08:28.674
-Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

08:29.842 --> 08:30.885
What was that?

08:30.968 --> 08:35.556
Johnny's bad luck is even sending
good vibes to Porkbelly's team.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.684
You hear that, Johnny?
Keep getting pummeled!

08:38.768 --> 08:41.270
Got it.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.400
Test! What are you doing?

08:46.484 --> 08:48.069
Resetting all my bones!

08:48.152 --> 08:50.780
Thanks, Johnny! I can play again!

09:11.759 --> 09:15.221
How can I enjoy this game
when I lost my delivery job

09:15.304 --> 09:17.014
and can't pay my bills?

09:18.849 --> 09:21.060
-Jackpot!

09:21.143 --> 09:24.438
Come on, more bad luck for Johnny!

09:26.399 --> 09:29.485
Ooh, it's such a great game,

09:29.569 --> 09:32.822
but I still miss my Dobermans.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.200
Dallas! Craig!

09:37.326 --> 09:38.786
You're back!

09:41.122 --> 09:42.290
He did it!

09:42.373 --> 09:44.667
Porkbelly will not be destroyed!

09:44.750 --> 09:46.460
But look, Porkbelly is losing,

09:46.544 --> 09:49.130
and if they don't win,
they'll blame Johnny.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.053
And<i> he'll</i> be destroyed.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.724
OK, we only need one basket.

09:59.807 --> 10:02.977
So get the ball to anyone except Test!

10:03.060 --> 10:05.104
He's even worse than he used to be!

10:07.148 --> 10:08.858
Johnny!

10:08.941 --> 10:10.318
You can take off the--

10:10.401 --> 10:13.070
-What?

10:13.946 --> 10:15.698
You can take off the--

10:15.781 --> 10:17.158
Whoa-oh-oh!

10:17.241 --> 10:18.743
Oh! Whoa!

10:19.368 --> 10:21.370
Duh… did you say something?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.331
The town is saved!

10:23.414 --> 10:25.499
Now take off the charm!

10:25.583 --> 10:28.753
Yes! And bye-bye, bad luck!

10:30.087 --> 10:31.422
Phew!

10:34.925 --> 10:37.470
Johnny, shoot it!

10:51.025 --> 10:52.276
Hmm?

11:01.410 --> 11:03.746
Porkbelly wins!

11:07.041 --> 11:08.709
Yaaaaaah!

11:08.793 --> 11:11.128
-Yes!

11:11.212 --> 11:13.464
I had a little good luck left after all.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.260
-Uh-oh.
