-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:41.200
in a court of law.

00:43.133 --> 00:46.133
-Officer Hackett:
In Fontana we have, you know,
great camaraderie,

00:46.167 --> 00:47.567
great relationships
with each other.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.067
I-- I compare it
to the military,

00:49.100 --> 00:51.633
where you have brothers
and sisters you work with
every day,

00:51.667 --> 00:54.233
and, you know, we crack
on each other, make fun
of each other,

00:54.267 --> 00:55.967
but it's all in good fun,
and at the end of the day

00:56.000 --> 00:58.833
I would trust every one
of these men and women
with my life.

01:00.367 --> 01:03.467
Uh, right now calls for service
are kinda light,

01:03.500 --> 01:06.667
so I like to do
some extra patrols

01:06.700 --> 01:08.167
in these business parking lots,

01:08.200 --> 01:11.633
especially some of these
vacant businesses, you know,

01:11.667 --> 01:13.533
just wanna make sure no one's
trying to gain access

01:13.567 --> 01:16.400
to those buildings
or breakin' into any cars.

01:17.733 --> 01:19.767
There's a guy right here
walking back and forth.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.967
Just wanna check him out
and see what he's got goin' on.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.533
-Hey, what's up, homey?
-Hi.

01:25.567 --> 01:28.333
Come over here.
Go stand over there.
-Okay.

01:28.367 --> 01:29.700
You got anything illegal on you?

01:29.733 --> 01:32.067
-No.
-No? Can I search you
to make sure?

01:32.067 --> 01:34.433
-Okay.
-All right. Don't walk a--
stop, dude.

01:34.467 --> 01:36.167
Stop, man.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.667
Every time I talk to you,
you-- you keep tryin'

01:38.700 --> 01:40.733
to put your hands
in your pocket.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.067
-I wasn't putting
my hands in there.
I was pullin' my pants up, man.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.267
-Stop, dude. Stop. Stop.
-Are you all right, sir?

01:45.300 --> 01:47.067
-Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop, dude.

01:47.067 --> 01:49.367
Just stop messin' around.
-You all right?
Are you okay?

01:49.400 --> 01:51.100
-Are you okay?
-I don't know you.

01:51.133 --> 01:52.867
-All right.
-My name is dirt.

01:52.900 --> 01:56.400
-(chuckles) Okay.
-Are you okay? Oh, sir--

01:56.433 --> 01:59.100
Hey!
-Stop, dude!

01:59.133 --> 02:02.100
-I don't owe you anything.
(laughs)

02:02.133 --> 02:05.233
-Stop.
-All right, I'm good.
No. (laughs)

02:07.367 --> 02:08.433
(thuds)
Aah!

02:08.467 --> 02:10.433
-Stop!
-Hey, brother. (laughs)

02:10.467 --> 02:13.400
Hey! (grunts)
-You're done. Stop.

02:13.433 --> 02:17.167
-Let me go, bro.
Let me go! Hey! Hey, help!

02:17.200 --> 02:21.167
Help! Help!
Hey, get off me, cop!

02:21.200 --> 02:25.767
Aah! (bleep) you.

Help! Hey, help!

02:42.367 --> 02:45.300
Oww!
-Calm down.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.933
-I don't have anything
on me, sir.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.800
You can check me.
(coughs) I'm clean, bro.

02:50.833 --> 02:53.400
-I was tryin' to,
but you kept pullin' away, dude.

02:54.567 --> 02:57.567
-Ease up. (grunts)
-Stand up.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.267
Why'd you keep
pullin' away like that, man?

02:59.300 --> 03:01.500
-'Cause I don't have anything
on me.

03:01.533 --> 03:03.467
-Well, now you're goin'
to jail.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.233
-I didn't even do nothin' man.

03:07.533 --> 03:11.400
-Dude, I'm tellin' you,
stop pullin' back, dude.

03:11.433 --> 03:12.500
Chill out.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.800
Ow, you all right, man?

-Stop!

03:17.833 --> 03:19.400

Sit down.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.100
Sit down.

03:35.133 --> 03:36.800

-You're not goin' anywhere.
Don't bite me!

03:45.067 --> 03:47.100
Do you understand me?

03:47.133 --> 03:49.233
What is your problem?

03:49.267 --> 03:52.467
-Yo, you cuttin'

03:52.500 --> 03:53.667
Pig.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.500
-Don't try to grab my hand
like that.

03:55.533 --> 03:58.067
Stop.
-Get these cuffs off me, man.

03:58.067 --> 03:59.667
I don't have anything.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.900
I ain't even doin' anything.

04:03.233 --> 04:05.800
-We'll cut off his backpack
once we're over there.

04:07.567 --> 04:10.567
-Are you all right,
man? Uh, you guys--
-What's wrong with you?

04:10.600 --> 04:13.467
-There's nothin' wrong

do anything.

04:13.500 --> 04:17.667
I don't have anything
on me. Yo, you don't need
to cut my bag off.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.467
-I'm not gonna
take these cuffs off,
that's for sure.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.633
-Pat me down!
-I already patted him down.

04:22.667 --> 04:25.133
-Dude, I'm not gonna

04:25.167 --> 04:28.067

You need to let me out,

04:43.300 --> 04:46.667
-You're goin'
to jail for obstruction.
-Nothin' on me, dude.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.400
And these cuffs
is way too tight.

04:51.233 --> 04:54.067
-I've arrested this guy before.
-Yeah, I know. I've dealt
with him before.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.200
He was walkin' around,
actin' like--

04:56.233 --> 04:58.167
swingin' his arms around,
bein' all crazy.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.433
Went to pat him down,
tried to pull away.

05:02.567 --> 05:06.467
Once I had him in cuffs,
went to pull his backpack off,
tried to bite my hand.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.167
Just actin' crazy, dude.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.867
Jeron.
Wake up, bud.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.433
-Yes?

05:17.467 --> 05:19.800
-What--
what-- what happened
earlier, dude?

05:19.833 --> 05:23.867
-(mumbling)
-Wake up. Wake up, wake up.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.967
Talk to me.
You tried to bite me, dude.

05:27.733 --> 05:32.467
You don't remember that?
-What? I-- I didn't try
to bite you. I was yawning.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.800
-You were yawning?
-Yeah.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.167
-Okay.
-Okay.

05:37.133 --> 05:40.500
-His behavior and demeanor,
it's consistent with being
high on meth.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.933
He usually has a pipe on him,
but today he doesn't
have anything.

05:44.967 --> 05:47.867
And um, he's usually
really cooperative.

05:47.900 --> 05:50.900
T-- Today somethin'
just set him off,
I don't know.

05:50.933 --> 05:55.067
I don't know what, but...
there's nothin' in the bag,
so, right now

05:55.100 --> 06:00.200
he's bein' charged
with, uh, obstructing, so...
misdemeanor obstruction.

06:00.233 --> 06:02.867
Just for pullin' away from me
while I was tryin'
to search him.

06:06.067 --> 06:07.733
All right, Jeron.
It's all good?

06:07.767 --> 06:10.200
-No, my cuffs
are too tight, sir.

06:10.233 --> 06:13.500
-Okay.
-Step out, I'm gonna
check those cuffs for you, bud.

06:13.533 --> 06:16.633
-Ow.
-You're fine, you're fine,
you're fine.

06:16.667 --> 06:19.467
Turn around.
No, it-- it's plenty
loose, dude.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.300
-I'm sorry.
-Sit down.

06:21.333 --> 06:23.133
-Excuse me,
you were supposed to be
doin' somethin'.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.533
-I was checking your cuffs.
-Well, can you untighten
my--

06:25.567 --> 06:27.233
-Sit down, dude.
-Can you untighten
my wrists, sir?

06:27.267 --> 06:29.700
-Jeron... sit down
or I'm-- I'm gonna put you
back in the car.

06:29.733 --> 06:31.067
-Please untighten my--
-Sit down.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.933
-Ow! Oww!

06:32.967 --> 06:34.567
-There you go.
-You see what you're
doin', dude?

06:34.600 --> 06:37.333
-Sit up. Sit up, stand up.
-Unnecessary, sir,
I'm bein' appropriate--

06:37.367 --> 06:39.700
-There we go.
-Inappropriately treated.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.067
-There we go. You're fine.
-I'm tellin' on you guys.

06:43.067 --> 06:44.633
I'm suing.
-Okay. All right.

06:44.667 --> 06:49.767
-Damn simple. I'm suing
your police. Blah!

06:49.800 --> 06:53.567
People, rahh...

06:53.600 --> 06:56.667
'Cause that's my name!

06:56.700 --> 06:59.333

07:18.700 --> 07:20.433
Uh, I'm gonna try to locate him.

07:20.467 --> 07:23.500
Should be in the area
or pretty close.

07:23.533 --> 07:25.533
This is where it happened,
right here.

07:25.567 --> 07:28.433

-(radio chatter)
-Yes, sir, I got all that.

09:13.967 --> 09:15.667

Be careful, okay?

09:22.667 --> 09:25.167
I don't want you
to fall and hit your head
or anything.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.300
That's your insurance?
-Yes, sir.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.867

That's-- I just want you

09:37.367 --> 09:39.133
so you don't fall over,
that's what I'm worried about.

09:39.167 --> 09:42.133
-I don't want y'all
to do anything against me,
'cause, like...

09:42.167 --> 09:44.533
-I'm not doing anything
against you.

09:44.567 --> 09:46.100
Try to make sure
you're okay.

09:46.133 --> 09:49.367
Ooh-- Easy.
Did you know you were involved
in an accident?

09:49.400 --> 09:52.233
-Yeah, I know,
I understand, only,
is the car gonna pull back,

09:52.267 --> 09:55.133
against us?
-No, it's not.
Nobody's in it.

09:55.167 --> 09:57.233
It can't pull back.
It's in park.

09:57.267 --> 10:00.267
You put it in park.
It's not gonna roll anywhere.
-(exhales)

10:00.300 --> 10:02.833
-I'm gonna go make sure
there's no barricades
in the road, I'll be right back.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.867
-Okay.
What's your first name?

10:04.900 --> 10:08.133
-It is, uh, Daniel.
-Daniel?
D-A-N-I-E-L?

10:08.167 --> 10:10.300
-Yes, sir.

10:15.133 --> 10:16.833
-You were born in '33?

10:16.867 --> 10:19.967
-I'm 33, yeah.
-You weren't born
in '33, you look way younger.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.100
-I was--
-You have-- you have
aged very well.

10:23.133 --> 10:25.500
If you were born in '33.
-I have, I'm 23 years old, sir.

10:25.533 --> 10:28.300
-Oh, you're 23.
-I'm 23, yeah.

10:28.333 --> 10:31.333
-Gotcha.
-All right.
That's not '33, that's '93.

10:31.367 --> 10:32.733
You were about 70--
60 years off.

10:32.767 --> 10:35.167
-I'm-- I'm like, uh,
23 years old.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.567
-That's fine.
-It's all good.
I don't-- I don't worry

10:37.600 --> 10:39.800
about it, like--
I just wanna get
the people here

10:39.833 --> 10:43.267
in my car tonight,
like, try to get to their
own homes...

10:43.300 --> 10:45.133
-Well, who else
was in the-- was

10:45.167 --> 10:47.500
with you?
-Yes, they are, but like...
I want-- I want--

10:47.533 --> 10:51.200
I just wanna get them
to their own homes tonight.
-Where are they at?

10:51.233 --> 10:53.200
Did they get out the car
and go somewhere else?

10:53.233 --> 10:54.633
Did they get in the car
with somebody else?

10:54.667 --> 10:56.500
-No, they're still in there.
-They're still in there?

10:56.533 --> 10:58.967
-Still in there.
-Okay, well, let me go check
on them and make sure

10:59.000 --> 11:00.500
they're okay.
I understand.
-I wanna get 'em

11:00.533 --> 11:01.767
their own place, you know?

11:01.800 --> 11:03.667
-Do me a favor,
let's go step over here?
-Oh, yeah.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.400
-And we'll have
a conversation, all right?
-Oh, yeah.

11:05.433 --> 11:07.900
-He's a highly
intoxicated individual.

11:07.933 --> 11:10.067
Well, he's sayin'
there's other people
in the car.

11:10.067 --> 11:12.200
Um, obviously
there's nobody in the car.

11:12.233 --> 11:14.767
-Daniel, how much
did you have to drink tonight?

11:14.800 --> 11:17.400
-I had a good amount
of drinks tonight.

11:17.433 --> 11:19.067
-A good amount of drinks?

11:19.067 --> 11:21.333
What I need you to do
is turn around and put
your hands behind your back.

11:21.367 --> 11:23.600
You're being placed under arrest
for operating while intoxicated.

11:23.633 --> 11:25.567
-Lean against the car
so you don't fall down.
-There you go.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.600
There you go, boss.

11:26.633 --> 11:27.767
There you go.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.867
Look, I'm gonna
slide your sleeves up, okay?

11:29.900 --> 11:31.267
You're good, man.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.800
-All right, Daniel.
-Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

11:36.833 --> 11:38.567
-Look, we'll-
we'll all walk together, okay?

11:38.600 --> 11:39.933
-We're gonna take care of you,
all right?

11:39.967 --> 11:42.100
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

11:42.133 --> 11:43.967
-Let's go to the police car
over here, man.

11:44.067 --> 11:47.933
-It's-- it's like--

it's-- hang out with me, like--

11:47.967 --> 11:49.300
-Just him.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.733
-I-- I understand, like...
(mumbles)

11:52.767 --> 11:55.067
-You have to sit down
with your butt first.

11:55.100 --> 12:00.433
-(mumbling)
-Slide your legs back
this way, okay?

12:00.467 --> 12:02.267
-Slide your butt
to the sound of my voice.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.367
Keep comin' this way.
Keep comin' this way.

12:06.933 --> 12:08.967
Keep comin'.
Almost in.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.067
-I'm here.
-One more leg.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.700
-All right.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.833
-There you go.
-All right, that's good.
That's good. That's good.

12:15.867 --> 12:18.500
Right there.
Just hang tight
right there, okay?

12:18.533 --> 12:21.433
-Is this okay?
-Just hang tight, man.

12:23.067 --> 12:25.733
-You saw what happened?
-Aw, man, he-- (laughs)

12:25.767 --> 12:29.133
He flew through the-- (laughs)
He flew-- (laughs)

12:29.167 --> 12:32.133
He flew through
the barricades, like,
I guess he didn't realize--

12:32.167 --> 12:33.733
yeah-- it was barricaded,
I guess.

12:33.767 --> 12:35.800
-Was it just him
in the car or somebody else?

12:35.833 --> 12:37.267
-No, it was just him.
-Just him?

12:37.300 --> 12:38.567
-Okay.
-It was just him. Yeah.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.133
-Okay.
So the barricade just went
flyin' everywhere?

12:40.167 --> 12:42.067
-Yeah.
-And then he said, "I'm gettin'
outta here"?

12:42.067 --> 12:43.933
Would you mind fillin' out
a witness statement?

12:43.967 --> 12:45.600
-Yeah.
-Sayin' what you saw
and all that stuff?

12:45.633 --> 12:47.333
-Yeah, that's cool.
I'll do that.
-Okay.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.933
Um... all right.
Cool, man.
-Cool.

12:48.967 --> 12:50.367
-I appreciate it.
-All right.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.067
I'll be right back.
I'll get your wit--
your statement.

12:54.267 --> 12:58.067
-Mr. Daniel?
-I just wanna like go to sleep
tonight, but like...

12:58.067 --> 13:00.133
-Okay. Well,
you'll be able to go to sleep.

13:00.167 --> 13:02.433
All right, Mr. Daniel,
look, here's the deal.
You're-- You're gonna be

13:02.467 --> 13:04.700
goin' to jail tonight
for-- for OWI...

13:04.733 --> 13:07.167
hit-and-run
and careless operation, okay?

13:08.867 --> 13:09.933
Okay?

13:11.200 --> 13:13.267
All right. Watch your knee.
I'm gonna close the door.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.767
-I just wanna
go to sleep tonight.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.067
-Watch your head.
-(door shuts)

13:18.767 --> 13:21.100
-Deputy Anderson:
Bein' a cop in a small town,
it has its advantages.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.900
When we get dispatched
to an address,

13:22.933 --> 13:25.167
usually we know
who we're gonna be dealin' with,

13:25.200 --> 13:27.733
what the obstacles
we're gonna be facin'

13:27.767 --> 13:29.100
once we get there.

13:29.133 --> 13:32.433
Like with this call,
it's a domestic/
criminal mischief.

13:32.467 --> 13:35.900
It seems like somebody's
busted the windshield
out of someone's car.

13:35.933 --> 13:37.833
So, um, we're gonna
step it up a little bit,

13:37.867 --> 13:38.900
and see what we got.

13:40.267 --> 13:42.467
I know this address.

13:43.733 --> 13:46.467
-Hello!
-Hey, Erin, come here,
stay outta the car.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.900
Hey, what's goin' on, guys?
-Now hear me out.

13:48.933 --> 13:50.733
-Erin, come here.
-Here?

13:50.767 --> 13:52.600
-Erin, come here,
right here in front--
front of the car.

13:52.633 --> 13:54.833
Right here.
-Once again, here we go.
It's my fault.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Right here.

13:56.233 --> 13:57.533
-Hands up.
-Stop.

13:57.567 --> 14:00.067
-I'll put 'em on right here.
(mumbles)
-Stop.

14:00.067 --> 14:02.200
-Why am I always the one
in cuffs?
-Stop.

14:02.233 --> 14:04.600
-Come on!
-You gotta stop it.

14:04.633 --> 14:07.067
-I'm not actin' crazy,
man. I'm leanin' in.
I'm bein' patient.

14:07.100 --> 14:10.600
-Relax.
-My name's Erin,
and I like to drink,

14:10.633 --> 14:11.967
and I ain't drivin'.

14:12.067 --> 14:13.733
I did nothin' wrong.
We just come here
and just relax.

14:13.767 --> 14:16.067
-What's goin' on?
-And then they spit on me

14:16.067 --> 14:17.400
and break my heart.
-Okay.

14:17.433 --> 14:20.133
-And he bust
my (bleep) windshield, too.
(bleep) that!

14:20.167 --> 14:22.467
-Hey.
-Nah!

14:22.500 --> 14:24.900
-I don't roll like that.
I ain't nice!

14:24.933 --> 14:28.067
-How'd you get soaked?
-Because they sprayed me
with the water.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.700
I was like a mutt.
-Hey! Don't talk to them,
talk to me.

14:30.733 --> 14:33.133
-But he sprayed me
with a water hose.
The guy's a bitch.

14:33.167 --> 14:34.567
-When was the last time
you used?

14:34.600 --> 14:37.067
-You know what?
I got drunk today,
and I ain't drivin'.

14:37.067 --> 14:38.700
You ain't got nothin'
on me, period.
-What else?

14:38.733 --> 14:41.133
-Write my name, Erin,
say that I ain't that good,
and I have no paper on me.

14:41.167 --> 14:43.600
-Okay.
-I'm just really stressed out
right now.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.900
-Okay, why are
you stressed out?
-Look at my windshield,

14:45.933 --> 14:47.700
in my car, he d-- Eric!

14:47.733 --> 14:50.200
Y'all sit and watch the show,
eatin' your (bleep) chips.

14:50.233 --> 14:53.067
-Hey! Turn around.
-I take care of them
and they hurt me.

14:53.067 --> 14:55.867
-Turn-- relax.
-Are you eatin' popcorn?

14:55.900 --> 14:56.933
-What your guys' relationship?

14:56.967 --> 14:59.300
-He's my friend,
but his mother-- have to.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.367
-What's that?
-That's my best friend.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.633
-Okay, how long
you guys been friends for?

15:04.667 --> 15:07.233
-Since May of last year.
He held me tight and told me
it was gonna

15:07.267 --> 15:10.133
be all right,
with what I went through,
and you know that, right?

15:10.167 --> 15:11.633
-Stay right here.
Stay right here.
-Remember?

15:11.667 --> 15:13.167
-What do you mean,
he held you tight?

15:13.200 --> 15:15.800
-He laid with me
every night and told me
that I was gonna be okay,

15:15.833 --> 15:18.067
'cause of what happened
with me and what's-his-nuts,
you remember.

15:18.067 --> 15:20.700
When you were out
over there, and I was
over there, with dinner,

15:20.733 --> 15:21.933
whoa, whoa, whoa?

15:21.967 --> 15:23.533
-(radio chatter)
-When was the last time
you used?

15:23.567 --> 15:25.333
-I have got a lot goin' on,
so leave me alone,

15:25.367 --> 15:27.767
and don't ask me questions
like that, 'cause this has
nothin' to do with that.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.067
-Oh.
-What happened was
I called 9-1-1.

15:30.067 --> 15:31.967
Look at my windshield
of my car.

15:32.067 --> 15:33.767
-I know.
I will when my partner
gets here.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.533
-Look at my car.
And why aren't they
gettin' talked to

15:35.567 --> 15:37.533
about meth
and whoa, whoa, whoa.
-I'm going to in a minute.

15:37.567 --> 15:40.067
-(bleep) Hamburger Helper
with a burn barrel,

15:40.067 --> 15:41.133
and here I am in cuffs?

15:41.167 --> 15:42.600
-Okay. I'm gonna talk
to them in a minute,

15:42.633 --> 15:44.267
but I'm talkin' to you
right now.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.767
-I'm done!

15:45.800 --> 15:48.800
-Hey, Sarge?
Could you watch her real quick
so I can talk to them?

15:48.833 --> 15:50.433
-Sure.
-Can I get
my cigarettes back, sir?

15:50.467 --> 15:52.767
-No, you're gonna stay
right there.
-I know.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.967
-What's goin' on, guys?

15:54.067 --> 15:55.833
Is she usually like this?
-Both: Yeah.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.933
-Okay. What do you think
she's on right now, meth?

15:57.967 --> 15:59.333
It's somethin'.
-Yeah.

15:59.367 --> 16:00.767
-Woman:
No, I think it's the alcohol.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.967
-Man: It's the alcohol.
-What's your guys' relationship?

16:05.067 --> 16:07.167
-Well, we're friends.
-What-- What are your guys'
relationship?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.433
-I'm his mom.
-My mom.

16:08.467 --> 16:12.933
-Okay.
Have you guys ever dated?
-No.

16:12.967 --> 16:16.533
I mean...
what would you say?

16:16.567 --> 16:19.433
-Were you guys intimate?
-I guess you could say that.

16:19.467 --> 16:22.933
-Okay.
-But, I mean, she's been--
she's been stayin' here

16:22.967 --> 16:25.533
'cause, uh, I guess
she got kicked out
of her dad's...

16:25.567 --> 16:26.867
-Okay.
-...a couple times.

16:26.900 --> 16:29.500
-Was there any hands
put on each other?
Did she hit you?

16:29.533 --> 16:31.867
-Man: No, she didn't hit me.
She was trying to hit me.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.500
She pushed me once.
-Anderson: She did push you?

16:33.533 --> 16:37.067
How'd she get soaked?
-Woman: She was talkin'
her smack, and we just--

16:37.100 --> 16:39.733
-She kept running her mouth
and calling us all kinds of--
every name in the book.

16:39.767 --> 16:42.367
-All right.
-And we just took
the hose at her.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.567
-"Just go."
-Who sprayed her
with the hose?

16:44.600 --> 16:45.933
-It was me.
-Okay.

16:45.967 --> 16:48.933
-Who popped her windshield?
-What?

16:48.967 --> 16:51.367
-Who popped her windshield?
She said somebody busted
her windshield.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.400
-Something got swung around,
and, uh, she threw it,
and I bobbed outta the way,

16:54.433 --> 16:56.067
and it hit the windshield.

16:56.067 --> 16:58.367
-Do me a favor
and have a seat for me.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.467
Erin?
-Yes?

16:59.500 --> 17:00.867
-He sprayed you
with the hose, correct?

17:00.900 --> 17:02.667
-Yeah, he said,
"You look dirty."

17:02.700 --> 17:05.133
I was hot.
He had to cool me off.

17:05.167 --> 17:07.667
Is that what he said?
-Eric told me you pushed him,
and you busted

17:07.700 --> 17:10.267
your own windshield?
-Yep, I threw a helmet
at it. I got pissed.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.067
They all ganged up
on me at once!

17:12.067 --> 17:14.467
-Okay.
-Sorry for my language.
I'm just a little upset.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.433
-Well, don't cuss.
-And he did his part, too.

17:16.467 --> 17:19.333
-Who?
-He ain't no daddy.
He's a bitch.

17:19.367 --> 17:22.567
-Okay. Who?
-Huh, the father.
They all sit

17:22.600 --> 17:24.767
and watch the show,
and I take care of it.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.267
-Okay.

How'd you get a cut
on your eye?

17:29.067 --> 17:32.233
-My son's girlfriend
hit me right in the face
a little while ago.

17:32.267 --> 17:35.500
-She did?

17:35.533 --> 17:37.967
just causin' trouble,
screamin' and fightin'.

-Okay.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.900
Well, there we go.
-She ran over and hit me
right in the face.

17:41.933 --> 17:44.133
She even attacked my wife,

and myself.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.167
And she's not my son,
and she just has a lab.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.133
You know, I mean,
I'm sure anybody
that acts like that,

17:52.167 --> 17:54.700

you know, on something.

17:54.733 --> 17:56.133

18:17.633 --> 18:20.067
Don't talk to her.
-Okay. No, I don't wanna

I appeared on that ticket twice.

18:47.433 --> 18:49.667
All right. Mom's goin' to jail,

out of our agency,

18:51.467 --> 18:55.200

-(radio chatter)

19:10.267 --> 19:12.867
-You can't be sprayin' at people
with a water hose just 'cause
you're mad at 'em

19:12.900 --> 19:15.600
and want 'em to leave.
How'd you like if I sprayed you
with a water hose?

19:15.633 --> 19:17.133
-If I deserved it,
I'd probably take it.

19:17.167 --> 19:19.200
-Unfortunately,
in this situation,
all four parties

19:19.233 --> 19:21.367

Hey, Erin. All right,

19:24.067 --> 19:25.900
Everyone's goin'
to jail tonight...

no relationship.

-'Cause that caused everybody
to go to jail.

19:39.967 --> 19:42.667
-It's all good. Hey,
Mommy and Daddy ain't
gonna be there forever.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.533
