<b>1x06 - "Cat Fingers"</b>

00:03.510 --> 00:06.290
Almost done. 
Steven, get the hubcaps.

00:06.740 --> 00:07.540
Hubbin' it up!

00:09.500 --> 00:12.560
Hub it good. 
This is a high-profile job.

00:12.740 --> 00:14.870
You mean 'cause it's
the Mayor's election-mobile?

00:15.130 --> 00:17.890
If we do this right, we
might get political favors.

00:18.140 --> 00:20.860
I'm not sure what
that is, but I like it.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.690
Hey, hey, hey!

00:27.725 --> 00:30.860
I'm not paying for
father-son bonding here.

00:32.290 --> 00:35.200
- Universe! Control that kid!
- Steven!

00:35.630 --> 00:39.100
I'm sorry, Mayor Dewey.
Uh, this one's on the house.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.600
On the house, eh?

00:42.070 --> 00:44.530
I like the way you do
business, Universe.

00:45.900 --> 00:50.140
<i>Mayor Dewey! 
Mayor Dewey!</i>

00:50.210 --> 00:52.210
Political favors!

00:52.480 --> 00:55.500
Ah, you rascal. Enough
with the hose fights.

00:55.535 --> 00:56.620
Ah, okay.

00:58.130 --> 00:58.850
What the...

01:00.430 --> 01:01.310
Whoa!

01:03.780 --> 01:05.340
What is with this cat?

01:07.860 --> 01:10.980
- Ha-ha! Got you guys.
- Amethyst!

01:11.070 --> 01:13.280
Uh, pretty cool, Amethyst.

01:13.520 --> 01:16.410
Really cool. I wish I could
shapeshift like you.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.720
You could probably learn.

01:17.890 --> 01:18.400
Really?

01:18.780 --> 01:20.380
Sure. You got a Gem.

01:20.410 --> 01:23.120
Whoa! Magic stuff.
Should I get out of here?

01:23.150 --> 01:24.650
Is there gonna be an explosion?

01:24.860 --> 01:26.450
Ah, it's  no big deal, Dad.

01:26.660 --> 01:28.980
Yeah, it's fuuuun.

01:30.490 --> 01:31.740
<i>Hey, Pearl.</i>

01:34.700 --> 01:37.010
- Do more!
- Check it out.

01:42.380 --> 01:45.310
- Whoa!
- Amethyst, you are overdoing it.

01:45.460 --> 01:47.660
Uh, chill it, dude.

01:47.950 --> 01:51.250
Just because you can shapeshift
doesn't mean you should.

01:51.390 --> 01:53.740
- Can you shapeshift?
- Well, of course...

01:53.775 --> 01:58.110
Well, of course I can. I'm perfect.
Whomp! Whomp!

01:58.950 --> 02:01.790
All Gems have
shapeshift powers, Steven.

02:02.070 --> 02:06.330
We can turn into objects, we can
change parts of our bodies, or...

02:06.770 --> 02:07.840
we could do that.

02:08.110 --> 02:09.229
Whomp! Whomp!

02:09.389 --> 02:10.470
I want to try it all!

02:10.770 --> 02:13.510
Don't bite off more than
you can chew, Steven.

02:13.511 --> 02:16.239
- Whomp! Whomp!
- Ugh!

02:17.440 --> 02:20.300
All right! Show me how to
change into a huge lion!

02:20.630 --> 02:23.010
Actually, for once, Pearl is right.

02:23.350 --> 02:26.180
If you're gonna do this, you gotta
start with something easy.

02:26.510 --> 02:28.090
Like that cat you turned into?

02:28.430 --> 02:30.460
That sounds good.
Now follow my lead.

02:31.470 --> 02:35.780
First: think of what you wanna
be, and then just shake it out.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.510
See?
Now your turn.

02:39.830 --> 02:40.600
Okay.

02:41.810 --> 02:44.230
Ca-a-a-a-a-t.

02:44.380 --> 02:47.470
Nah, you're too tense.
Just relax and feel it.

02:49.070 --> 02:50.632
Biorhythms, yo'.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.580
Fe-e-e-e-el it.

02:54.050 --> 02:57.030
Eeeh, if you are not
ready, we can try later.

02:57.130 --> 02:58.420
No way. I can do it.

03:01.150 --> 03:03.560
Yeah. Yeah.

03:08.140 --> 03:09.610
Well, it was a good try.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.400
This is so cool!

03:19.560 --> 03:23.135
You should go show your Dad.
He's gonna freak out!

03:24.980 --> 03:26.280
<i>Dad, I'm back.</i>

03:26.640 --> 03:29.140
- Hey, Stu-ball.
- Check it out.

03:33.860 --> 03:38.140
- I shapeshifted my finger into a cat.
- Whoa!

03:39.030 --> 03:42.650
Is that a thing you can do now?
That's pretty cool.

03:42.685 --> 03:43.580
I know. Right?

03:43.930 --> 03:46.430
I'm gonna take this show on the road.

03:50.390 --> 03:52.230
<i>That'll be $1.05, Steven.</i>

03:52.680 --> 03:57.180
Mmm, okay. Here's a nickel.
And a buck!

03:58.430 --> 03:59.913
- Whaaaat?
- Whaaaat?

04:00.960 --> 04:02.900
Oh, Steven, that's adorable.

04:05.830 --> 04:09.500
- Are you making it purr?
- It kind of does what it wants.

04:09.710 --> 04:10.540
Really?

04:12.202 --> 04:15.031
- Ow!
- See what I mean?

04:15.040 --> 04:18.010
- Bad cat finger!
- Ah, I'm sure it just wants to play.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.570
You are right!
And he doesn't have any friends.

04:21.820 --> 04:25.619
Oh, my gosh!

Hey, Petey!

04:40.230 --> 04:42.540
Whoa! 
You work the deep fryer now?

04:42.890 --> 04:44.130
Make me some fry bits.

04:44.440 --> 04:48.620
Steven, I take my job seriously.
Please, use the actual menu.

04:48.810 --> 04:52.240
- Give me the bits. The bits!
- All right, listen. 

04:52.275 --> 04:54.370
It'll be over sooner if you
just give him what he wants.

04:55.470 --> 05:01.080
Whoa. Hey, hey! It's not for me.
It's for these guys.

05:03.020 --> 05:07.390
- What the...
- Uh, here's your... bits.

05:10.350 --> 05:13.530
- I can't look away.
- Steven, that is freakish.

05:13.910 --> 05:15.630
No, it's not. It's natural.

05:15.950 --> 05:19.370
Shake... it... out!

05:22.130 --> 05:24.043
- See?
- Wow!

05:24.078 --> 05:26.134
You know who would love this?

05:26.135 --> 05:28.190
Your older brother. Yo, Ronaldo!

05:28.450 --> 05:29.440
What's up, Dad?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.800
I gotta take a pic for
"Keep Beach City weird".

05:37.360 --> 05:39.430
- What's that?
- It's my blog!

05:39.630 --> 05:43.020
Keep... Beach... City... weird.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.550
Can I see the picture?

05:47.340 --> 05:49.670
Yikes!
Oh, ooh. Sorry, guys.

05:49.820 --> 05:54.150
I guess cat fingers don't
function well as... fingers.

05:55.740 --> 05:58.000
Shh!
I'm just getting a snack.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.715
- Whoa!
- Steven! Need some help?

06:05.920 --> 06:07.580
Nah, it's cool.

06:08.170 --> 06:10.460
Oh, good. See you later then.

06:10.720 --> 06:11.310
Huh?

06:11.820 --> 06:15.550
We're taking the Gem sloop out
to sea to fight a living island.

06:16.180 --> 06:16.590
What?

06:19.310 --> 06:22.450
Uh... Amethyst, wait!

06:23.510 --> 06:26.910
<i>I wanna go on the Gem sloop!
I want to see a living island!</i>

06:27.210 --> 06:28.960
<i>Wait, wait, wait!</i>

06:30.440 --> 06:31.030
Steven!

06:32.260 --> 06:34.510
Come on! You can make it!

06:38.610 --> 06:42.850
- Steven! What's going on?
- Uh... i-it's nothing.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.270
Uh, I just turned all
my fingers into cats.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.220
We have to stay and help Steven.

06:48.370 --> 06:51.210
We can't. This is a
tectonic emergency.

06:51.310 --> 06:52.880
We'll deal with Steven
when we get back.

06:53.680 --> 06:57.700
- Amethyst, I blame you for this!
- Eh, that's fair.

06:59.210 --> 07:03.060
<i>Steven! Just try to stay calm!</i>

07:06.310 --> 07:10.610
Enough! No more cat fingers.
I want Steven fingers!

07:11.210 --> 07:13.652
And I don't mean little
me-heads on fingers.

07:13.653 --> 07:15.280
I mean my regular fingers.

07:25.900 --> 07:26.690
Oh! Stop!

07:31.180 --> 07:34.750
Amethyst! Pearl! Garnet!

07:36.190 --> 07:36.880
Dad!

07:45.000 --> 07:46.840
Hello? Who's there?

07:47.810 --> 07:51.262
We're closed.
Come back tomorrow...

07:55.640 --> 07:56.750
Da-a-ad...

08:02.930 --> 08:05.430
- Steven?
- Dad!

08:08.210 --> 08:11.360
Help! The cat fingers
are taking over my body!

08:13.410 --> 08:13.990
Hold on!

08:15.240 --> 08:18.070
- I'll get you out of there!
- Dad!

08:19.120 --> 08:22.010
No! 
Bad! Bad cat fingers!

08:24.300 --> 08:25.780
Can't you make them go away?

08:25.850 --> 08:28.030
I tried, but it made it worse.

08:29.470 --> 08:33.090
<i>My life is over!
I can't go on magic adventures!</i>

08:33.140 --> 08:34.669
<i>I can't even open the fridge.</i>

08:34.909 --> 08:37.510
And I'll never get to have
another water fight with you, Dad,

08:37.700 --> 08:40.450
'cause these things hate...
water.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.120
They hate water!

08:42.750 --> 08:44.440
Dad, spray me again!

08:54.610 --> 08:56.430
It's not enough water!

08:57.710 --> 08:59.340
Turn on the superwash!

08:59.380 --> 09:01.920
No! I won't do it!
It's too dangerous.

09:02.240 --> 09:05.005
You've got to! I'm a monster!

09:05.006 --> 09:07.770
I'm an adorable cat monster!

09:07.990 --> 09:09.970
No, you're not! You're my son!

09:10.280 --> 09:12.200
Dad, please!

09:46.110 --> 09:46.700
Dad.

09:48.590 --> 09:50.059
We did it.

09:59.170 --> 10:01.960
Steven! 
Okay, let me see it.

10:02.790 --> 10:06.510
Well, you... you... you
got them to go away?

10:07.110 --> 10:12.370
It just goes to show - always listen
to me and never listen to Amethyst.

10:12.650 --> 10:13.340
That's fair.

10:13.790 --> 10:18.240
It goes to show - you should
have a little more faith in Steven.

10:18.680 --> 10:23.823
Yeah, that would've been
a total cat-tastrophe.

10:25.830 --> 10:28.960
But I'm feeling much better meow!

10:30.630 --> 10:33.030
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

10:33.060 --> 10:34.050
Okay, that's enough.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.820
Wait. I've been coming up
with cat jokes all morning.

10:36.980 --> 10:39.580
You guys, I'm feline fine!

10:39.860 --> 10:42.210
Everything's purr-fect!

10:43.050 --> 10:46.110
Oh, come on! 
I'm just kitten around!
