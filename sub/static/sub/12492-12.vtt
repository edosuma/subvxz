00:08.060 --> 00:10.100
Hey, charlie,
check this out.

00:10.100 --> 00:12.710
Here's something nobody has
ever seen before.

00:12.710 --> 00:15.920
<i>Gabe is brushing</i>
<i>his hair.</i>

00:18.280 --> 00:20.910
Do you have to videotape
everything we do?

00:20.910 --> 00:23.550
This isn't a reality show.

00:23.550 --> 00:26.860
Oh, I know it's not reality
because he took a shower
without being asked.

00:28.130 --> 00:31.340
You know what I think?
I think you like someone.

00:31.340 --> 00:33.670
What if I do?
No big deal.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.680
Are you kidding?
Your first crush
is a huge deal.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.950
Look, she is a girl.
I'm a guy.

00:38.950 --> 00:40.860
These things happen
every day.

00:40.860 --> 00:42.230
Not to you.

00:42.230 --> 00:44.370
I know.
Can you believe it?

00:44.370 --> 00:48.210
Hey, kids,
come on, let's go.

00:48.210 --> 00:50.820
P.J. Honey, can you
watch charlie after school?

00:50.820 --> 00:52.150
I have to work.

00:52.150 --> 00:53.590
I can't.
I'm working too.

00:53.590 --> 00:55.260
I can take charlie with me
if you want.

00:55.260 --> 00:57.800
You want to help
your big brother
deliver chicken?

00:57.800 --> 00:59.700
Or you could come
to the hospital

00:59.700 --> 01:02.340
And help mommy
change bedpans.

01:02.340 --> 01:05.340
You take her.

01:05.340 --> 01:08.350
Gabe, are you
wearing aftershave?

01:08.350 --> 01:10.080
A little.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.920
Why would you do that?
You're not shaving yet.

01:11.920 --> 01:15.360
As long as we're being logical,
why do you still have a comb?

01:17.100 --> 01:19.270

Is your sister home?

03:21.060 --> 03:22.760
Yes.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.160
Who was that?

03:29.160 --> 03:32.070
Mrs. Dabney with her
stupid questions.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.440
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

03:39.610 --> 03:41.950
I have a follow-up
question--

03:42.780 --> 03:45.320
May I speak
to your sister?

03:45.320 --> 03:47.620
What can I do for you,
mrs. Dabney?

03:47.620 --> 03:49.390
I'm going out of town
for a couple of days

03:49.390 --> 03:51.420
And I was wondering
if y'd be kind enough

03:51.420 --> 03:53.260
To look after
my cat caboodle.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.690
Oh, I don't know.
I'm awfully busy.

03:55.690 --> 03:57.420
I'll pay you
$20 a day.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.760
My schedule
just opened up.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.530
Mm-hmm.

04:01.530 --> 04:04.230
- I can trust you, right?
- Of course.

04:04.230 --> 04:08.770
You do seem to be
the least disturbed
of all the duncan kids.

04:09.970 --> 04:12.870
What an almost
sweet thing to say.

04:12.870 --> 04:14.970
You need to know
that caboodle

04:14.970 --> 04:16.980
Is the most important thing
in the world to me.

04:16.980 --> 04:18.610
How's mr. Dabney doing?

04:18.610 --> 04:21.149
Like I said,
love that caboodle.

04:28.420 --> 04:30.890

Kwikki chikki.

04:32.590 --> 04:36.020
- Oh, hello.
- Hi, it's $21.07.

04:36.020 --> 04:38.860
Oh, okay.
Who is this cutie pie?

04:38.860 --> 04:41.860
I'm p.J.

04:41.860 --> 04:44.400
I meant the other
cutie pie.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.230
Oh, this is charlie.
She's my baby sister.

04:47.230 --> 04:49.700
Why, isn't she
the most precious thing
in the whole world?

04:49.700 --> 04:53.400
Yeah, my mom's
at the hospital,
so I'm looking after her.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.040
Oh, you poor dear.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.400
Keep the change.

04:57.410 --> 04:59.770
Are you sure?
This is almost a $20 tip.

04:59.770 --> 05:01.780
Oh, you need it
more than I do,

05:01.780 --> 05:04.380
What with your mom being
in the hospital and all.

05:04.380 --> 05:07.310
Oh, you think
my mom is in--

05:09.480 --> 05:12.420
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It's been hard.

05:12.420 --> 05:15.190
Enjoy your chicken.

05:17.590 --> 05:21.390
Charlie, welcome to
the chicken delivery business.

05:26.230 --> 05:28.130
Give him dry food
twice a day

05:28.130 --> 05:30.460
And make sure
his water bowl
is always filled.

05:30.470 --> 05:33.270
Oh, and my sister virginia
is coming by later
for a play date.

05:33.270 --> 05:36.770
You want me
to have a play date
with your sister?

05:36.770 --> 05:39.540
Not you-- caboodle.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.840
Virginia brings
her cat stanley over.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.670
What a ridiculous name
for a cat.

05:43.670 --> 05:46.410
- Caboodle?
- Stanley.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.310
Oh, I should go.

05:50.310 --> 05:52.950
But so my little caboodie
won't make a scene,

05:52.950 --> 05:54.280
You need to
distract him.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.580
Should I pretend
to be a mouse?

05:56.580 --> 05:58.380
Yes.

05:58.380 --> 06:01.290
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.

06:01.290 --> 06:03.990
- The cat seems fine to me.
- I'm paying you.

06:03.990 --> 06:06.390
Now put him down
and act like a mouse.

06:11.130 --> 06:12.930
Squeak squeak.

06:12.930 --> 06:15.670
You can do better than that.
Bare your teeth,
wiggle your nose

06:15.670 --> 06:18.670
And act like you're eating
a piece of cheese.

06:22.810 --> 06:25.380
Now keep doing that
for 20 minutes,

06:25.380 --> 06:29.220
And he should be fine.
Goodbye, my caboodle.

06:33.450 --> 06:37.360
Teddy honey,
did you lose something?

06:37.360 --> 06:39.460
Only my dignity.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.530
Mom, can you help me
with something?

06:47.530 --> 06:49.570
Sure, honey.
What can I do for you?

06:49.570 --> 06:51.200
Well, I have this friend

06:51.200 --> 06:53.740
And he needs to know
how to talk to girls.

06:54.540 --> 06:57.000
Does this friend
have a name?

06:57.010 --> 07:03.280
No-orman.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.280
That's an odd name.

07:05.280 --> 07:09.550
Well, I think
he's from no-orway.

07:09.550 --> 07:13.290
Gabe honey,
I'm your mom.

07:13.290 --> 07:15.290
You don't have to
be embarrassed

07:15.290 --> 07:17.990
About telling me about
your first crushy-wushy.

07:17.990 --> 07:20.560
I'm just gonna go
look it up on the internet.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.530
No no no, it's okay.

07:22.530 --> 07:24.430
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

07:24.430 --> 07:27.900
Okay, so what have you
said to her so far?

07:27.900 --> 07:29.640
Um, I said,

07:29.640 --> 07:32.740
"that was juice,
not pee."

07:32.740 --> 07:34.810
And then
she walked away.

07:34.810 --> 07:37.370
Oh, no-orman.

07:37.370 --> 07:40.640
Every time
I get near her,

07:40.640 --> 07:43.280
My heart starts pounding,
my hands get all sweaty

07:43.280 --> 07:44.910
And I can't speak.

07:44.910 --> 07:47.820
Oh, you've got it bad.

07:49.450 --> 07:51.750
I remember
my first crush.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.020
Was it dad?

07:53.020 --> 07:56.020
Sure, why not?

07:56.020 --> 07:59.930
So what do I do?
How do I talk to her?

07:59.930 --> 08:02.690
Well, when you start
to get a little nervous,

08:02.700 --> 08:06.560
Just ask her questions.
Let her do the talking.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.370
Find things
you have in common.

08:08.370 --> 08:11.900
So just ask her stuff
and listen to the answers?

08:11.900 --> 08:13.170
That sounds easy.

08:13.170 --> 08:14.440
Sure.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.910
Relationships are
a piece of cake.

08:16.910 --> 08:19.810
That's why married people
are always so happy.

08:23.650 --> 08:26.180
Did dad ever get nervous
talking to you?

08:26.180 --> 08:28.080
Oh, when your dad and I
first started dating

08:28.080 --> 08:30.450
We didn't do
a lot of talking.
Mostly we just--

08:30.450 --> 08:32.890
Just what?

08:36.820 --> 08:40.159
Played checkers--

08:40.159 --> 08:43.100
Lots and lots
of checkers.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.740
- P.J.: <i>Hey, dad.</i>
- Hey.

08:53.740 --> 08:58.640
You're taking care of charlie
tomorrow afternoon, right?

08:58.640 --> 09:00.440
I believe I am.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.350
You know, I was thinking
maybe she should come
to work with me.

09:03.350 --> 09:04.680
Why?

09:04.680 --> 09:07.880
Because I feel I didn't
do enough to help out

09:07.880 --> 09:09.550
When teddy and gabe
were babies.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.820
Enough?
You didn't do anything.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.160
I know.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.160
And it haunts me.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.100
It haunts you?

09:20.100 --> 09:21.760
Yes.

09:21.760 --> 09:25.430
That's why I have to
make it up to you
with charlie.

09:25.430 --> 09:27.700
Okay.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.430
Love you, dad.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.340
Oh, that boy's
up to something.

09:37.340 --> 09:39.810
I should probably
get into this.

09:39.810 --> 09:42.440
Eh, he's all the way
upstairs.

09:56.260 --> 09:58.890
Gabe's voice:
<i>Listen and find</i>
<i>things in common.</i>

09:58.890 --> 10:01.160
<i>Listen and</i>
<i>find things in common.</i>

10:04.330 --> 10:07.530
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:11.070 --> 10:13.700
Tell me about yourself.

10:13.710 --> 10:15.440
Why?

10:15.440 --> 10:17.810
I mean,
only if you want to.

10:17.810 --> 10:19.980
Okay, what do you
want to know?

10:19.980 --> 10:22.780
Tell me about
your family.

10:22.780 --> 10:24.510
Oh, the family.

10:24.510 --> 10:27.080
Actually there's
not much to tell.
I'm an only child.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.420
Me too.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.050
Cool.

10:31.050 --> 10:32.590
What else?

10:32.590 --> 10:35.120
Well, my parents
are divorced.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.890
Mine too.

10:36.890 --> 10:39.790
- Who do you live with?
- Who do you live with?

10:39.790 --> 10:42.590
- My mom.
- Me too.

10:42.590 --> 10:44.660
Wow, we really have
a lot in common.

10:44.660 --> 10:48.330
You kn, I had
a eling we might.

10:48.330 --> 10:50.870
Want half of
a peanut-butter sandwich?

10:50.870 --> 10:53.200
No, thanks.
I'm allergic tpeanuts.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.970
Me too.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.150
You d'do much,
do you?

11:10.320 --> 11:13.850
Hey hey, catch.

11:14.790 --> 11:17.960
Or stay.

11:20.060 --> 11:21.960
Good cat.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.660
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

11:28.770 --> 11:30.800
Mrs. Dabney,
why are you back here?

11:30.800 --> 11:33.240
Oh, I'm not estelle.
I'm her sister virginia.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.970
Wow, you really look
like mrs. Dabney.

11:36.970 --> 11:41.840
Except for my laugh lines.
Estelle doesn't have
any of those.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.580
Gabe, this is mrs. Dabney's
twin sister virginia.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.220
This is my brother gabe.

11:47.220 --> 11:49.320
Oh, you look like
a nice little boy.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.750
Would you like
some candy?

11:50.750 --> 11:54.220
Only if you
eat one first.

11:54.220 --> 11:56.490
You're as cute
as the dickens.

11:56.490 --> 11:58.860
Okay, this is
dang freaky.

11:58.860 --> 12:01.490
Okay, stanley.

12:01.490 --> 12:04.330
Let's go play
with caboodle.

12:06.470 --> 12:08.570
Here we go.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.210
- Uh-oh.
- What's wrong?

12:15.210 --> 12:18.370
Caboodle always gets excited
when stanley arrives.

12:18.370 --> 12:21.740
He's just been lying
on the couch all day.
Do you think he's sick?

12:21.740 --> 12:24.780
You'd better hope not.
I'd hate to be in your shoes

12:24.780 --> 12:26.680
If something happened
to my sister's baby.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.580
Well, it's not my fault.
She'd understand that, right?

12:29.580 --> 12:32.850
Oh, yeah.
She's very understanding.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.660
Come on, caboodle,
perk up.

12:38.660 --> 12:40.760
This does not
look good.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.590
Oh, I know what will
cheer you up--

12:42.590 --> 12:45.630
Mr. Mouse, right?

12:45.630 --> 12:47.360
This does not
look good either.

12:55.530 --> 12:58.970
The whole family's
pitching in to help out
with charlie,

12:58.970 --> 13:02.710
Because my mom's
in the hospital.

13:06.340 --> 13:07.780
Thank you.

13:08.980 --> 13:11.080
And thank <i>you.</i>

13:13.680 --> 13:16.980
Used to be
her Halloween costume,

13:16.980 --> 13:18.480
But with mom
in the hospital,

13:18.480 --> 13:20.780
We can't afford to buy her
a winter coat--

13:22.150 --> 13:25.520
A new winter coat.

13:30.860 --> 13:33.590
- Is your mom any better?
- The same,

13:33.600 --> 13:36.430
But we're trying
to be brave.

13:36.430 --> 13:38.930
You poor thing.

13:38.930 --> 13:40.600
Aww.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.930
It's hardest
on the little ones.

13:42.940 --> 13:45.440
Whenever we visit mom
in the hospital,

13:45.440 --> 13:47.040
Charlie does this.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.870
Mama mama mama.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.880
Warren, get out here!

13:51.880 --> 13:54.410
And bring your wallet!

14:00.220 --> 14:03.050
Thanks for coming on such
short notice, dr. Tushy.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.320
It's pronounced "tushy."
you don't have to thank me.

14:06.320 --> 14:10.060
Caboodle dabney is one of
my favorite patients.

14:10.060 --> 14:13.130
I didn't know veterinarians
made house calls.

14:13.130 --> 14:15.230
Oh, they don't.
I'm a therapist.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.460
A therapist for cats?

14:17.460 --> 14:19.930
And birds.
But never at the same time.

14:19.930 --> 14:22.130
You only make
that mistake once.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.670
Uh-huh.
Huh.

14:30.780 --> 14:33.410
Oh.

14:33.410 --> 14:34.580
( sighs )

14:34.580 --> 14:36.780
So what's wrong
with caboodle?

14:36.780 --> 14:40.410
Well, his aura is off.
His chakras are out of line.

14:40.420 --> 14:42.850
How's his poop?

14:42.850 --> 14:45.120
Fine.
How's yours?

14:45.120 --> 14:48.220
Well, that's
a little personal,

14:48.220 --> 14:51.220
But since you ask,
super good and getting better.

14:53.090 --> 14:55.590
Maybe we should get back
to the cat, dr. Tushy.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.960
It's "tushy."

14:56.960 --> 14:58.560
Tushy.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.230
- Huh-uh, tushy.
- Tushy?

15:01.230 --> 15:04.400
Tushy tushy tushy.

15:05.770 --> 15:08.210
- Do you have
a first name?
- Tish.

15:08.210 --> 15:09.940
Tish tushy?

15:09.940 --> 15:11.140
"doctor."

15:11.140 --> 15:15.480
Anyway, can you fix him?

15:17.550 --> 15:19.320
No.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.750
But you can.
Caboodle is feeling
abandoned.

15:22.750 --> 15:25.450
He needs to know
he's safe and secure.

15:25.460 --> 15:28.590
Now close your eyes
and send him a thought

15:28.590 --> 15:30.760
To let him know
you care.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.860
Can't you give
him a shot or--?

15:32.860 --> 15:35.400
Send him a thought.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.470
Send him a thought.
Send him a thought.

15:38.470 --> 15:39.930
Do you have a thought?

15:39.940 --> 15:42.200
Oh, I'm having
a few of them.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.740
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

15:55.750 --> 15:58.020
- Kit.
- Hi, gabe.

15:58.020 --> 16:00.650
- What are you doing here?
- I told my mom all about you

16:00.650 --> 16:02.560
And we just wanted
to say hi.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.660
Yeah, it is so wonderful
that kit met someone

16:05.660 --> 16:07.660
With a family
just like ours.

16:07.660 --> 16:09.930
Okay.

16:09.930 --> 16:11.660
Do you mind
if we come in?

16:11.670 --> 16:13.900
Yeah, sure, I guess.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.930
Okay.

16:18.540 --> 16:22.570
You know, I'll actually
be right back.

16:22.570 --> 16:23.900
Okay.

16:26.210 --> 16:29.380
I have a big problem.
What are you doing?

16:29.380 --> 16:33.710
I'm readjusting
caboodle's aura.  Duh.

16:33.710 --> 16:35.850
- I'm in big trouble.
- What's wrong?

16:35.850 --> 16:39.080
- The girl I like
is here with her mom.
- What's wrong with that?

16:39.090 --> 16:41.020
I told her
mom and dad are divorced

16:41.020 --> 16:43.490
And I'm an only child.
What am I gonna do?

16:43.490 --> 16:46.260
Okay, the first thing
you're gonna do
is calm down.

16:46.260 --> 16:49.360
Your negative energy
is upsetting the cat.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.360
You gotta help me.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.000
Okay, relax,

16:53.000 --> 16:56.160
Or later you're gonna have
trouble with your poop.

16:56.170 --> 16:57.470
Teddy.

16:57.470 --> 16:59.270
Fine, I'll go
and get rid of them.

16:59.270 --> 17:00.840
Wait, they can't know
you're my sister.

17:00.840 --> 17:04.810
Right, so I will be
somebody else.

17:06.069 --> 17:10.109
Hi, I'm teddy,
the housekeeper.  See?

17:10.109 --> 17:12.750
Hi, I'm dana.
This is kit.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.750
Why are you
wearing a cat?

17:14.750 --> 17:18.819
Because in my country
we have a saying

17:18.819 --> 17:22.119
"the house looks its best
when a cat's

17:22.119 --> 17:23.890
On your chest."

17:23.890 --> 17:27.089
What country is that?

17:27.089 --> 17:29.090
Canada.

17:29.090 --> 17:33.300
Mrs. Duncan isn't home
and I have a house to clean,

17:33.300 --> 17:35.900
So as we say in my country,
"oot."

17:35.900 --> 17:37.530
"oot oot."

17:37.530 --> 17:39.570
Okay, could you just
tell her we stopped by?

17:39.570 --> 17:41.100
You betcha.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.370
Hey, everybody.

17:43.370 --> 17:46.110
- Who's that?
- That's the chicken
delivery guy.

17:46.110 --> 17:49.080
- Dude, what's with the cat?
- None of your business.

17:49.080 --> 17:52.180
And don't call me "dude,"
chicken delivery guy.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.250
Now come out
to the porch

17:55.250 --> 17:57.580
Where I will teach you
how to use a doorbell.

17:57.580 --> 18:01.350
You know what's weird?
He didn't have any chicken.

18:01.350 --> 18:04.720
He's just here
to take our order.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.890
Then another guy comes
and delivers it.

18:06.890 --> 18:09.960
It's not a good system.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.830
I'm the chicken
delivery guy.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.730
See?

18:14.730 --> 18:17.830
That is such
an adorable baby.
Is she--?

18:17.830 --> 18:20.100
Part of the promotion.
Right, p.J.,

18:20.100 --> 18:22.100
Which may or may not be
your name?

18:22.100 --> 18:24.710
That's right.
A promotion.

18:24.710 --> 18:27.010
Kwikki chikki
is introducing

18:27.010 --> 18:29.380
Baby back ribs.

18:29.380 --> 18:32.180
And they make you
carry around a baby?

18:32.180 --> 18:34.080
That comes
from corporate.

18:34.080 --> 18:38.050
They have no idea
what it's like
out in the field.

18:39.420 --> 18:42.620
Look who's here.
Who is here?

18:42.620 --> 18:46.260
- Hi, I'm bob.
- The exterminator.

18:46.260 --> 18:48.530
Yeah, I'm a little
more than that.
Why are you wearing a cat?

18:48.530 --> 18:51.700
Oh, forget the cat.
There is a skunk
in the backyard

18:51.700 --> 18:54.600
And I demand you go
exterminate it right now.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.640
What are you talking about?
Skunks don't come out
during the day.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.000
Well, then go out
and tell him that.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.070
Sorry about that.
He does good work,
but he's a little chatty.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.170
Mom?  No!

19:06.180 --> 19:08.270
Well, hello to you too.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.410
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm dana.
I'm kit's mom.

19:11.410 --> 19:13.950
- I'm amy.
- This baby is so cute.

19:13.950 --> 19:15.250
Isn't she?

19:15.250 --> 19:19.220
She sure makes me want
some baby back ribs.

19:20.590 --> 19:22.350
Beg pardon?

19:22.350 --> 19:24.990
- No skunk back there.
Oh, hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

19:24.990 --> 19:27.690
Wow, you're very friendly
with the exterminator.

19:27.690 --> 19:29.790
I do sleep next to him
every night.

19:29.790 --> 19:32.160
- I didn't realize
you had a boyfriend.
- She's got a what?

19:32.160 --> 19:34.160
The exterminator
is your boyfriend.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.060
The exterminator is
my husband.

19:36.070 --> 19:38.430
- So you remarried?
- I was never divorced.

19:38.430 --> 19:39.970
Well, kit told me
you were.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.070
Because that's what
gabe told me.

19:46.970 --> 19:50.180
I may have told
a teeny little lie.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.410
Sorry.
I just wanted you
to like me.

19:54.410 --> 19:57.050
Gabe, you should have
just told me the truth.

19:57.050 --> 19:58.680
I know.
And I promise,

19:58.680 --> 20:00.850
From now on I'll always be
completely honest with you.

20:00.850 --> 20:03.350
- I'm back.
- Now who's this?

20:03.350 --> 20:06.360
That's either virginia
who's nice and gives out candy

20:06.360 --> 20:08.420
Or mrs. Dabney--
her evil twin.

20:08.420 --> 20:11.060
We're out of here.

20:18.070 --> 20:21.170
Well, charlie, the good news is
caboodle's fine.

20:21.170 --> 20:24.210
Turns out all he needed
was a trip to the litter box.

20:24.210 --> 20:27.880
But the bad news is
gabe's romance with kit is over.

20:27.880 --> 20:31.710
Well, the good news is
I don't have to shower anymore.

20:31.710 --> 20:34.350
That's really good news.

20:34.350 --> 20:37.780
So if your brother gabe
goes to give you a hug,

20:37.790 --> 20:40.620
Well, good luck, charlie.

20:40.620 --> 20:43.620
Don't worry.
That won't happen.

20:46.290 --> 20:49.290
Hey, mom, charlie and I
have to work a double tomorrow.

20:49.300 --> 20:52.800
What?  Why do you keep
taking charlie to work?

20:52.800 --> 20:56.330
Because I love her.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.140
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

21:00.510 --> 21:02.610
Nobody?

21:08.780 --> 21:13.050
- May I help you?
- I just wanted to drop off
this casserole.

21:13.050 --> 21:14.380
Excuse me?

21:14.380 --> 21:17.480
Well, with p.J.'s mom
being in the hospital

21:17.490 --> 21:22.220
And him practically having to
raise charlie on his own--

21:22.220 --> 21:25.220
It's just so sad.

21:25.230 --> 21:27.190
You think--

21:27.190 --> 21:30.330
Gosh, that smells good.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.400
It is sad.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.340
- I find when people
are in need--
- thank you.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.400
Kids, dinner's ready.

21:55.910 --> 21:58.550
- <i>( doorbell rings )</i>
- It's open.

22:00.310 --> 22:02.950
There's another one?

22:06.490 --> 22:07.570
There's another one?

22:07.570 --> 22:09.300
- What?
- I don't know.

22:09.390 --> 22:12.390
We're the world famous queens
of ***, Winsconsin.

22:12.530 --> 22:15.230
We were the biggest news story of 1958. 

22:15.300 --> 22:17.880
This was supposed to be a family reunion.

22:18.270 --> 22:22.700
- What happened?
- Estelle kicked us out. That woman's not right.

22:23.340 --> 22:24.900
Tell me about it!
