<i> Previously on Transformers Prime...</i>

00:03.436 --> 00:06.636
Download of the Iacon database
may have been incomplete,

00:06.637 --> 00:10.139
but we now possess four sets
of coordinates decoded by the ship.

00:10.140 --> 00:14.240
If we are to have any hope
of recovering the Iacon relics

00:14.241 --> 00:18.135
before the Decepticons do
we must divide our resources.

00:18.170 --> 00:21.270
Dispatching multiple squads will enable us

00:21.271 --> 00:23.771
to pursue all four coordinates simultaneously.

00:23.772 --> 00:28.272
I will embark for the Antarctica.
As for you, old friend,

00:28.273 --> 00:30.773
I would prefer that you have
company on your mission.

00:30.774 --> 00:35.374
You can't be serious.
Wheeljack is insubordinate, a ruffian!

00:35.375 --> 00:38.275
Wheeljack is a highly capable warrior.

00:38.276 --> 00:41.676
You would be wise
to welcome the temporary alliance.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.380
The boss thought you need a backup, huh?

00:57.523 --> 01:02.724
If you must know Optimus feels
strongly that you require supervision.

01:03.534 --> 01:06.634
I'll be sure to be on my best behavior, Doc.

01:07.258 --> 01:09.658
Please, don't call me "Doc".

01:10.347 --> 01:12.947
Whatever you say... sunshine.

01:24.579 --> 01:29.580
So, all of team Prime's busy
chasing down for Iacon relics?

01:29.781 --> 01:33.381
- The four which are currently in play.
- There's more?

01:33.382 --> 01:37.482
Megatron maintains possession
of the entire Iacon database.

01:37.483 --> 01:40.083
We have yet to learn
how many more relics

01:40.084 --> 01:43.284
or the Decepticon weapons
of mass destruction it contains.

01:43.285 --> 01:45.785
No worries, Doc. I've got your back.

01:45.786 --> 01:47.386
My name is not "Doc"!

01:47.387 --> 01:49.987
And I do not require
anyone watching my back!

01:50.575 --> 01:53.675
I proved my metal during
the war for Cybertron.

01:53.676 --> 01:56.276
Then I'm lucky you're
alone for the ride, champ.

01:58.821 --> 02:01.221
'Cause we have a boogey on our tail.

02:54.487 --> 02:55.887
Soundwave! 

02:58.049 --> 02:59.949
Megatron's communications chief?

02:59.950 --> 03:02.050
He must be tracking
the same coordinates.

03:04.215 --> 03:06.215
You might want to grab on to something.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.180
Are you trying to send
us to the scrap yard?

03:45.704 --> 03:46.904
What's that?

03:46.905 --> 03:49.205
Soundwave's surveillance
drone, Laserbeak.

03:57.715 --> 03:59.315
Wheeljack, maintain pursuit!

03:59.316 --> 04:01.916
Soundwave is merely using
the drone to distract us.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.008
I welcome a good distraction.

04:13.238 --> 04:15.138
The hunter becomes the hunted.

04:15.804 --> 04:17.803
This is no time to be hunt dog.

04:34.687 --> 04:37.688
He is gone.
Now, we can go find Soundwave.

05:10.995 --> 05:12.395
What are you doing?

05:16.512 --> 05:20.013
Wheeljack?
Wheeljaaack!

05:28.694 --> 05:30.514
Took up that, Con!

05:31.045 --> 05:32.345
You did it!

05:57.850 --> 05:59.951
Right thrust is fried.

05:59.952 --> 06:03.652
If you had pursuit
Soundwave as I instructed...

06:03.752 --> 06:06.352
His little birdie was
still a bit pecking our tailpipes.

06:06.675 --> 06:10.676
Well, we need to resume our
search for the relic immediately.

06:10.677 --> 06:12.477
Soundwave may already have reached it.

06:12.478 --> 06:14.678
The Jackhammer is not going anywhere.

06:14.679 --> 06:17.379
If you wanna catch that Con,
we need to roll.

06:20.918 --> 06:23.918
Make up your mind.
Are we walking or are we driving?

06:32.384 --> 06:33.984
Wheeljack, keep your distance.

06:33.985 --> 06:36.185
Laserbeak is the eyes
and ears of Soundwave.

06:38.561 --> 06:40.161
Not anymore, it isn't?

06:59.713 --> 07:02.213
Operating system appears
functional but offline.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.714
However the crash clearly damaged
its optic and audio receptors.

07:06.715 --> 07:09.116
Guess someone's gonna need a new snitch.

07:09.117 --> 07:12.717
A minor victory and not
the one we're here to achieve.

07:15.564 --> 07:17.064
Hang on there, Doc.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.306
Situation's right for an old wrecker trick.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.948
I am... not sure I follow.

07:24.059 --> 07:27.007
Sooner or later Soundwave's
gonna come looking for his pet.

07:27.008 --> 07:31.510
We let them reunite and return
to base packing a light grenade.

07:31.610 --> 07:36.210
The first time 'Wave reaches inside,
it rips the bang and kaboom!

07:38.569 --> 07:40.769
Why plant a mere insanitary device?

07:40.770 --> 07:44.470
When we could plant
a more devastating bomb.

07:49.030 --> 07:50.830
A virus.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.796
Engineered to pass from
Laserbeak to Soundwave.

07:58.159 --> 08:02.459
Then directly into the
Decepticon warship's mainframe,

08:03.353 --> 08:07.653
where it will transmit the content
of the entire Iacon database...

08:08.355 --> 08:09.855
...to us.

08:11.441 --> 08:14.341
Sounds complicated.
Thought we're in a hurry.

08:14.342 --> 08:15.943
Optimus would agree.

08:15.944 --> 08:20.845
Risking the loss of one relic
to gain the rest is worth vile gamble.

08:21.109 --> 08:23.909
You really have a chance to
pull of that kind of programming?

08:25.231 --> 08:28.997
Not alone.
I will require backup.

08:41.546 --> 08:43.846
<i>Raphael. We have a situation.</i>

08:57.563 --> 09:00.263
<i>If you could write
a source code for the virus,</i>

09:00.264 --> 09:04.064
<i>my scanner will translate it to
Cybertronian script as it uploads.</i>

09:04.065 --> 09:05.065
I can do it,

09:05.066 --> 09:09.466
but if you wanna keep the virus in
from the 'Cons, you'll need a decoy,

09:09.467 --> 09:11.367
you know, like a second virus.

09:14.071 --> 09:16.771
Or something less complicated.

09:20.974 --> 09:25.175
A decoy as in... we wanted them
to find it but doesn't blow?

09:25.176 --> 09:26.676
Correct.

09:27.310 --> 09:30.310
Seems like a waste
of a perfectly good grenade.

09:38.285 --> 09:39.585
Wait a minute,

09:39.586 --> 09:42.286
a grenade inside of
Laserbeak inside of Soundwave.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.143
Like a "turducken".

09:44.993 --> 09:46.293
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

09:46.515 --> 09:50.615
It's a turkey stuffed with a duck,
stuffed with... nevermind.

09:53.166 --> 09:54.767
And where are you off to?

09:54.768 --> 09:56.668
To buy you some time,

09:56.768 --> 09:59.968
and who knows,
maybe to pick up a relic.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.952
You dropped something. 

10:46.738 --> 10:48.438
This should be fun.

11:57.627 --> 12:00.727
Here I go again...
sharing expectations.

12:02.505 --> 12:05.805
Rafael, ejecting the
Laserbeak's supplying transmitter.

12:06.098 --> 12:08.098
When you're ready
I will bring its operating system

12:08.099 --> 12:10.499
back online and note it
to receive the transfer.

12:31.617 --> 12:33.117
Any last words?

12:35.829 --> 12:37.729
Right, silent type.

13:03.664 --> 13:07.065
Ratchet, the virus is coded.
Commencing upload.

13:46.262 --> 13:47.862
Rafael, what is our progress?

13:50.104 --> 13:51.204
50 percent.

13:54.203 --> 13:55.203
<i>Doc.</i>

13:55.204 --> 13:57.904
Wheeljack, I told you not to call me that!

13:58.599 --> 13:59.899
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

14:00.741 --> 14:02.241
What's wrong, where are you?

14:03.611 --> 14:06.811
<i>Thinking you've got maybe...
two minutes.</i>

14:15.700 --> 14:17.100
More or less.

14:29.445 --> 14:31.045
Wheeljack, what is your condition? 

14:31.351 --> 14:32.551
Wheeljack!

14:34.316 --> 14:35.516
Rafael?

14:36.028 --> 14:37.428
<i>We're almost there.</i>

14:58.740 --> 14:59.640
Done.

15:35.423 --> 15:36.623
Scrap!

16:47.471 --> 16:49.471
Soundwave has taken the bait.

16:50.115 --> 16:53.901
Wheeljack.
Scrap.

17:05.034 --> 17:07.034
The resonance blaster!

17:07.035 --> 17:12.385
Crafted by Decepticon scientist
for maximum sonic devastation.

17:12.486 --> 17:18.214
Soundwave, you have performed
admirably unlike Dreadwing here

17:18.262 --> 17:21.744
who somehow managed to loose
the APEX armor to Starscream.

17:22.266 --> 17:26.266
However, two more decrypted
coordinates remain in play.

17:26.586 --> 17:29.286
And I have every confidence
that Knockout and I...

17:30.870 --> 17:33.870
Can you believe
what the autobots did to me?!

17:36.161 --> 17:39.662
- Did you retrieve the relic?
- No, master.

17:40.137 --> 17:43.637
Then I suggest you convince
me of your continue

17:43.638 --> 17:46.838
usefulness by examining Laserbeak, Doctor.

17:53.369 --> 17:54.569
Wheeljack!

18:02.238 --> 18:05.338
Just resting my optics.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.161
And my audio receptors.

18:16.006 --> 18:20.150
- What is it?
- An obstruction of some sort.

18:25.998 --> 18:27.398
Grenade!

18:31.473 --> 18:33.273
Ah, that is clever.

18:33.537 --> 18:38.738
Knockout, prepare to properly
dispose of the obstruction.

18:49.220 --> 18:50.420
Soundwave,

18:50.518 --> 18:54.118
if we're to maintain any
advantage over the Autobots,

18:57.433 --> 19:00.133
decoding the remainder
of the Iacon database

19:00.134 --> 19:02.434
must remain your top priority.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.660
Rafael, send the groundbridge.

19:10.764 --> 19:13.164
I still advice that you return to base.

19:13.165 --> 19:15.365
You require a thorough examination.

19:15.366 --> 19:19.266
The only thing I require right now
is some hole sealant.

19:19.583 --> 19:23.084
Trust me, the Jackhammer here
is more needing repair than me.

19:23.385 --> 19:25.185
Listen, Wheeljack.

19:25.186 --> 19:31.086
I want to... thank you...
for your backup.

19:31.878 --> 19:33.078
Yep.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.846
See you around, Ratchet.

20:11.691 --> 20:13.291
Ratchet, come here!

20:16.906 --> 20:18.706
The Iacon database?

20:19.021 --> 20:21.121
It's downloading to our mainframe!

20:23.300 --> 20:27.001
Rafael, you are a genius.

20:30.569 --> 20:32.469
Oh, believe me,

20:32.470 --> 20:36.870
Soundwave will provide
the coordinates to the remaining relics.

20:36.871 --> 20:42.671
Yes, we are fortunate
to have him on our side, lord Megatron.

20:42.672 --> 20:46.872
And see about repairing
his cracked visor, will you?

20:59.606 --> 21:01.506
Bulkhead is coming through,
Agent Fowler.

21:02.569 --> 21:04.869
I can't wait to share the news.

21:11.116 --> 21:12.316
No!
