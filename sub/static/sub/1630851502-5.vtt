04:00.631 --> 04:02.546
You know what

04:02.590 --> 04:05.593
To kind of put the pressure on.

04:05.636 --> 04:06.855
- I feel like
you're super lucky

to not have
all of this pressure

04:08.596 --> 04:11.642
and everyone constantly
staring at your stomach.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.905
- All I want from you
for my birthday is to hear,

04:13.949 --> 04:16.560
"Hey, Dad, you're going to be
a grandfather again."

04:16.604 --> 04:19.215
Oysters stimulate
your reproductive--

04:19.259 --> 04:23.567
- You brought me here to eat
oysters to stimulate sex?

04:23.611 --> 04:25.265
Like, if I eat a cheeseburger

I'm like, "No, I'm just
a little bloated." I'm like--

04:29.269 --> 04:30.748
- Yeah.
But it's on my mind too.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.663
I mean, I am thinking about
all of those things,

04:32.707 --> 04:34.230
even single and not married.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.362
So...

04:35.405 --> 04:37.407
Guess what
I am doing today.

04:37.451 --> 04:40.280
I have a consultation
with a fertility doctor

04:40.323 --> 04:41.890
to freeze my eggs.
- What?

04:41.933 --> 04:43.326
- Freeze your eggs?

04:43.370 --> 04:44.632
- Yeah. I just thought
it's a good idea,

04:44.675 --> 04:46.590
because everyone's
already got kids,

04:46.634 --> 04:49.985
Erin is trying for a kid,
and I am not married yet.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.769
So that takes the pressure

04:51.813 --> 04:54.511
off of trying
to meet somebody right now.

04:54.555 --> 04:57.253
Because when you turn 35,
your egg count goes down by,

04:57.297 --> 04:59.124
like,
60% or something like that.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.735
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.084
Clock's ticking.

05:02.127 --> 05:04.478
Have to be with somebody.
You have to get married.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.306
Have to have kids.
It's just too much stress.

05:06.349 --> 05:09.439
So I'm, like, gonna take that
off my plate, freeze my eggs.

05:09.483 --> 05:14.314
- Why am I thinking omelet?

05:14.357 --> 05:15.576
Yeah, we do it at the ranch.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.360
You know, we got 19 eggs.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.797
- Wait. 19 out of one mare?
- Really?

05:19.841 --> 05:22.147
- Uh-huh,
and 11 out of the other.

05:22.191 --> 05:25.325
- Yeah, I won't be going there
to do it, but...

05:25.368 --> 05:27.457
- I feel a little weird
about it.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.285
- I know it's uncomfortable.
- Yeah.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.375
Like, when your kids were young
and having those periods

05:32.419 --> 05:35.465

05:45.519 --> 05:47.042

05:47.085 --> 05:49.087

down there.

Shut your face.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.181

gonna wait before you--

05:56.225 --> 05:57.966

- You look awful pretty.

09:56.683 --> 09:57.597
- Oh, do I?
- You do.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.989
- Thank you.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.470
- Hello, beautiful.
Welcome to my party.

10:01.513 --> 10:02.906
- Oh, been here a while.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.255
- You look awful beautiful.

10:04.299 --> 10:05.779
- Thank you.
You're very handsome.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.128
- Hello, gorgeous,
welcome to my party.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.434
What have you been doing?

10:09.478 --> 10:13.569
- Well, I went
to my fertility appointment.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.485
Like, just went in to kind of
see, you know, like--

10:16.528 --> 10:17.921
- See what? See your eggs?

10:17.965 --> 10:19.270
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you see them?

10:19.314 --> 10:20.663
- Yep.
There weren't many of them.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.404
- How'd they look?

10:22.447 --> 10:26.016
- It was a lot lower
than what I had thought.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.236
- So this is your right ovary.

10:28.279 --> 10:31.631
We have about one
to two follicles on this side

10:31.674 --> 10:34.372
and about three on this side.

10:34.416 --> 10:37.201
Normally, we'd like to see
between 10 and 20 follicles.

10:37.245 --> 10:40.291
We're seeing about four
to five follicles.

10:40.335 --> 10:43.468
That means that freezing
your eggs right now

10:43.512 --> 10:44.774
is probably a good idea.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.863
- Yeah.

10:46.907 --> 10:51.302
- I hate comparing your eggs
to horse eggs,

10:51.346 --> 10:55.132
but we've got mares that can't
necessarily get in foal,

10:55.176 --> 10:57.134
but we harvest their eggs.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.702
And shoot, we've got tons
of eggs out of these old mares.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.312
- Technically, we were doing

11:01.356 --> 11:03.619
exactly the same process
that she's going through.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.229
- Right. Exactly.
- Yeah.

11:05.273 --> 11:06.883
- I tell you, if you'll
come here on Monday, Wednesday,

11:06.927 --> 11:09.973

with our reproductive doctor,

11:10.017 --> 11:11.975

what I'm saying.

11:12.019 --> 11:14.499
We're in the egg business here

out of these mares.

11:16.545 --> 11:17.981
This is what we do here.

a lot of things in my life,

11:20.201 --> 11:23.291

to a horse right now...

11:23.334 --> 11:25.510
- No.
- What?

11:27.512 --> 11:28.949
- Once you freeze them,
they can be frozen

11:28.992 --> 11:29.993
till the end of time.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.300
- We can keep them here.
- I--no.

11:32.343 --> 11:34.563
- We can put them
in our egg machine.

11:34.606 --> 11:37.174
- I don't want my eggs mixed in
with horse eggs. Thank you.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.523

It's a whole situation.

- Just go on in. It's fine.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.632
- You have to look at it.
- I can't.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.590
Ooh, it's warm.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.462
It's like
a big old warm tunnel.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.249
-
Don't--I'm not kidding.

20:08.859 --> 20:10.774
- Put this between
your fingers.

20:10.818 --> 20:14.169
- Push the semen in.
- You're doing fantastic.

20:14.213 --> 20:18.826
- Your whole arm goes up--
is that the butthole?

20:21.307 --> 20:23.309
I don't know.
It's all one big hole.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.615
- Well, when you breed--when
you breed a mare,

20:25.659 --> 20:27.574
you don't go up the butthole.
- Oh, it's not the butt.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.709
Whatever.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.755
- World champion.
- Right?

20:34.798 --> 20:38.324
- You've created life.
- Oh, my God!

20:38.367 --> 20:40.108
<i>I can't believe
I'm saying this,</i>

20:40.151 --> 20:42.719
but seeing
this whole horse process

20:42.763 --> 20:44.547
is actually making me
more comfortable

20:44.591 --> 20:46.027
with the fertility process.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.029
<i>- I'm really proud of you.</i>

20:48.072 --> 20:49.465
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.511
That's one thing great
about this family.

20:51.554 --> 20:54.340
We may bitch and argue
like every family does...

20:54.383 --> 20:55.993
- Yeah.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.343
- But by golly,
we've got each other's backs.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.301
- Yes, we do.
- And we're there for you.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.303
- Holy crap.

21:01.347 --> 21:02.913
- How about that, huh?
