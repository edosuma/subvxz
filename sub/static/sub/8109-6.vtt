00:01.293 --> 00:03.830
(ROCK MUSIC BLARING)

00:08.258 --> 00:11.000
Sure, let's give up now.
It's no big deal.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.551
It's just Pharmacide,
just their tour kick-off.

00:13.639 --> 00:17.803
I mean, who cares if
we miss the most insane
party in the world?

00:23.690 --> 00:26.272
Come on, Phoeb.
Victory or death.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.350
Or possibly cake.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.195
Look, I'm sorry.

00:32.449 --> 00:35.282
Sorry, your caffeine fix
is on its way.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.575
Will you hold on?

00:37.663 --> 00:40.621
Hi, we're the
DJ's assistants.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.538
(ALL EXCLAIMING HYSTERICALLY)

00:49.841 --> 00:51.126
Hold on.

00:52.219 --> 00:56.212
No. I said we both
work for him.

00:56.306 --> 01:00.049
You mean "her."
The DJ is a she-jay.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.976
It's okay, Dave,
she's my plus one.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.472
Make that plus two.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.995
You weren't worried,
were you?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.068
Yes.

01:20.163 --> 01:23.121
And there will be
punishment unless
you tell us everything.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.789
You've been here
all night?

01:24.876 --> 01:28.164
After the party, we went
up to the Presidential Suite
with the band.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.587
PHOEBE: It was ginormous,
like 10 rooms.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.414
We had a few drinks
and some weed,

01:32.509 --> 01:34.921
and played Drummer God
on this giant plasma TV.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.968
Which she rocked,
by the way.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.591
I think I hate you
right now.

01:38.682 --> 01:42.425
Colt took me up to the roof,
but by then the gate
to the pool was locked.

01:42.519 --> 01:48.480
So no one was up there.
So we just climbed over
and jumped down,

01:49.693 --> 01:51.684
and went skinny dipping.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.484
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

01:53.572 --> 01:54.607
Did you do it?

01:54.698 --> 01:57.280
No. He was so sweet.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.985
Later, he played his guitar
and he wrote a song for me.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.865
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

02:04.875 --> 02:06.331
KAITLIN:
Oh, my God.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.628
Jord, what happened
to your foot?

02:08.712 --> 02:10.828
AVERY: Maybe you
twisted your ankle
when you jumped.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.662
KAITLIN:
Or it could be
your allergies.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.669
My aunt was allergic
to some cold medication,

02:14.760 --> 02:18.127
and her hands swelled up
like the Marshmallow Man's.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.052
Jord, are you okay?

02:21.475 --> 02:22.681
Jordan!

02:58.720 --> 03:02.338
Foreman expects me
to read an x-ray on
this itty-bitty screen.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.048
He should have e-mailed
me a larger phone.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.883
Why are you packing?

03:08.271 --> 03:10.182
We're leaving
this afternoon for
the conference

03:10.273 --> 03:12.013
on pharmacology
and public policy.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.474
We?
We discussed this.

03:13.568 --> 03:14.899
It's been on your
calendar for weeks.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.066
So has Ramadan.

03:16.154 --> 03:20.397
Think of it as a vacation.
Nice, healthy Adirondack air.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.858
Or not, I don't care.
You're coming with.

03:22.953 --> 03:26.411
You should come with me.
State Pillow-Fighting
Championships.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.534
Dollar beers,
wet t-shirts.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.490
In the words
of the philosopher
Eddie Money,

03:30.585 --> 03:32.200
"I've got two tickets
to paradise."

03:32.295 --> 03:35.662
House, when you moved in,
I promised your therapist
I'd be here for you.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.749
I can't be here if I'm there,
unless you're there, too.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.050
So it's not a discussion.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.718
Fine.

03:41.805 --> 03:46.139
I'll let Foreman know that
the 16-year-old patient with
the severe edema can wait.

03:46.935 --> 03:50.553
Relax, I got no idea
what's wrong with her,
so odds are not fatal.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.682
(SIGHING)

03:51.773 --> 03:53.309
Still not going.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.147
She's got rhabdo.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.279
Who wants to come
to the Pillow-Fighting
Championships?

04:01.366 --> 04:02.947
Rutgers has
got a great
team this year.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.570
So glad their anchor
didn't turn pro.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.903
Sixteen-year-old girl
suddenly has the joints
of an 80-year-old.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.408
You think
we can discuss this
for a second?

04:09.499 --> 04:11.035
lt's rhabdo.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.115
Patient gave you
the answer.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.825
She fell down
and went boom.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.083
We have to leave
in an hour, so should
we eenie meenie?

04:17.174 --> 04:20.337
The fall would explain
the lower leg damage,
but not the swollen hands.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.213
Hard landing caused
crushed muscles,

04:22.304 --> 04:24.260
crushed muscles
released toxins into
the bloodstream,

04:24.347 --> 04:26.554
toxins caused swelling
in the hands and legs.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.883
Just another way of
saying it's rhabdo.
Fifty-nine minutes.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.184
She's a credit-card kid.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.763
Parents are architects.
They're working on
a project in Shanghai.

04:34.858 --> 04:38.396
Could you be sitting any
further away from Chase
and still be in the same room?

04:38.487 --> 04:39.693
It doesn't have
to be rhabdo.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.941
The swelling could
also be caused by
deep vein thrombosis.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.772
She has allergies,
could be anaphylaxis,

04:43.867 --> 04:45.277
or some heart condition
that we don't...

04:45.368 --> 04:48.781
It can't really be
any of those things
since it's rhabdo.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.363
I know it's rhabdo,
Foreman knows it's rhabdo,

04:51.458 --> 04:53.790
deep in his heart,
even Chase knows
it's rhabdo.

04:53.877 --> 04:57.040
Isn't it annoying when
everybody in the room knows
something you don't?

04:58.256 --> 05:00.338
l'll test for everything.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.633
He's an ass.

05:07.724 --> 05:08.964
Contrast is ready.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.300
She already thinks
I'm cheating on her.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.646
Maybe this is House's way
of telling you to talk to her.

05:13.730 --> 05:17.564
Sure. "How was your day,
honey? By the way,
I killed someone."

05:18.235 --> 05:22.148
If I tell her,
that's dumping a burden
on her forever.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.612
(SIGHING)

05:24.908 --> 05:26.239
Okay.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.565
(EXHALING)

05:28.578 --> 05:31.194
No sign
of obstructions
or clots.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.998
Tell me what you
came here for, House.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.754
I've got
a legitimate
medical reason.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.177
You must be so proud.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.504
I've forgotten it.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.011
I guess it's no big deal
since I was only using it

05:52.102 --> 05:55.094
as an excuse
to come check out
Patty and Selma.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.476
lfeelbad.
I haven't named
your testicles.

05:58.567 --> 06:01.775
Word on the street is
you set a new personal
best for low-cut.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.854
I don't know why
you chose to give them
the names of somebody's aunts.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.781
It's a compliment.
They're always smoking.

06:08.451 --> 06:12.694
I remember. I need you
to authorize the medical
discharge of a minor.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.496
That's why
I'm holding this
in my hand.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.955
Haven't finished
testing yet, but it's...

06:20.881 --> 06:25.420
Your outbox is three
times normal size.
That's not a metaphor.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.048
There's a lot to be done
before the weekend.

06:30.140 --> 06:34.975
You could take papers
home with you. Unless
you're not gonna be home.

06:35.645 --> 06:39.388
Unless you were,
for example, going
to a medical conference.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.767
I'm driving up
with Wilson.

06:40.859 --> 06:41.894
Me, too.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.441
You aren't on the
registration list.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.234
I love that you checked.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.021
That I have a case? Yeah.

06:48.116 --> 06:52.450
You're authorizing
the discharge right now.
That was a metaphor.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.335
I'm busy right now.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.291
Is he dying?
Yeah.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.760
In the next 10 minutes?

07:12.223 --> 07:15.260
Unfortunately, no.
He's in a lot of pain.

07:16.436 --> 07:20.145
I thought about it.
You're right, I should
go to the conference.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.971
You found out
Cuddy's going.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.978
Oh, God, no.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.442
She'll ruin everything.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.278
We leave in two hours.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.073
(SOFTLY)
Please, morphine.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.197
(GASPING)

07:42.087 --> 07:45.124
WILSON: I'm right here.
I'm right here, Joseph.

07:50.679 --> 07:54.092
Two days away.
You think I should
pack Bally?

07:54.766 --> 07:59.260
You can't leave.
You lit a fuse, you need
to watch the bomb go off.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.767
The bomb was gonna
go off on its own
if you kept quiet.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.314
So now you either
have to come up
with a convincing lie

08:05.402 --> 08:07.563
or tell her the truth.
Your choice.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.732
CK levels point
to rhabdo.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.984
Of course.

08:12.075 --> 08:15.863
Except for the part
where imaging shows
no sign of muscle crush.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.012
Hi. I'm your doctor,

08:33.096 --> 08:36.088
and this is Lars Ulrich,
greatest metal drummer
of all time.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.171
(HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING)

08:37.267 --> 08:38.848
You know the song?

08:39.436 --> 08:41.472
Good. Drumstick.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.853
Here's another drumstick.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.933
I want you to rock out
to the music, the way
you did last night.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.520
Come on.
This is a classic
medical test.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.026
Hippocrates used it.
Let's go.

08:59.122 --> 09:02.990
Come on, you gotta keep time.
Crossover on the high-hat.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.666
Let's head-bang.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.621
House, what
are you doing?

09:09.716 --> 09:11.832
Chart said her
potassium's low.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.757
Rhabdo elevates potassium.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.836
And the monkey drums.

09:16.473 --> 09:20.682
Ergo, her levels must have
been really low last night.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.475
Which causes...

09:23.271 --> 09:24.386
(SIGHING)

09:25.231 --> 09:27.062
I can't move them.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.228
(MUSIC STOPS)

09:29.694 --> 09:33.232
...temporary muscle
paralysis. Given this rate
of muscle fatigue,

09:33.323 --> 09:37.236
there's no way she could
have climbed stairs and
then a fence to the pool.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.694
Low potassium
means no jump,
means no trauma.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.121
Tests mean,
yes, rhabdo.

09:43.208 --> 09:47.372
Ergo, something else
caused both the rhabdo
and the low potassium.

09:47.462 --> 09:50.625
This time,
start by getting
an accurate history.

09:50.965 --> 09:54.173
Be careful,
our patient's
a big, fat liar.

09:58.389 --> 10:00.766
What did you
really do last night?

10:00.850 --> 10:03.102
CAMERON: We need
to find the cause of
your low potassium.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.928
You could have
a kidney disorder,
leukemia, adenoma.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.229
We need to know
about any drugs
or alcohol,

10:08.316 --> 10:10.523
anything that might
have threatened
your health.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.146
Come on, Jord.

10:14.489 --> 10:17.572
Okay, we didn't
spend the night
with the band.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.365
You can't tell
our friends.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.660
Have you heard of
Stiletto: Warrior
Queen of Space?

10:22.747 --> 10:23.862
It's a comic book, right?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.072
Thank you, yes...
Yeah.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.452
...and a freaking amazing
new sci-fi series,

10:27.544 --> 10:29.080
and they're filming
the motion picture now.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.081
It's a prequel.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.254
The other girls
wouldn't get it.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.297
Only Phoebe
understands
my passion.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.843
Only Phoebe understands
"the bushido of the heel."

10:38.930 --> 10:40.136
(SIGHING)

10:41.558 --> 10:43.674
So what actually
happened last night?

10:43.768 --> 10:44.974
JORDAN:
We were with our friends,

10:45.061 --> 10:47.677
trying to get into
the Pharmacide tour
party at the Adams.

10:47.772 --> 10:51.765
And then / found out
that Jeffrey Keener
was gonna be there.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.225
I follow his tweets.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.154
It's tragic that
I have to explain this.

11:05.832 --> 11:10.997
He’s the creator of Stiletto
issue number one
and the TV show.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.794
He's a god.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.713
So did you guys
go up to him?

11:15.800 --> 11:16.880
God, no.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.425
We keep
a 10-foot rule.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.094
It's not stalking
if you don't go up to the
person and bother them.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.218
So we just followed
him around.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.344
Discreetly.

11:25.435 --> 11:29.303
He ditched after half an hour
and went down to the hotel
restaurant for a late dinner.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.183
And you went with him?
Discreetly.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.275
We played it so cool.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.731
For two hours,
we lived his life.

11:40.825 --> 11:44.784
We did everything
he did, ate the exact
same meal he ate.

11:45.663 --> 11:46.994
Cool.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.783
CAMERON: The rest of
their story checks out.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.912
Hotel manager says Mom
and Dad were charged
for food and a room,

11:52.003 --> 11:54.369
three pay-per-view
episodes of Stiletto...

11:54.464 --> 11:57.956
You trying to kill yourself?
It's from the same batch
the girls ate.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.384
They ate what he ate,
and what 100 other
healthy people ate.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.962
Dig in, lunch is
on the Adams.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.672
What if food
is the answer?

12:06.768 --> 12:09.805
Not this food, any food.
Jordan says
she ate all of this.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.807
She's 16, all
about body image,

12:11.898 --> 12:14.014
and she obviously
worries about fitting in.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.814
Bulimia would account
for her symptoms.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.938
We should do
a barium swallow for
Mallory-Weiss tears,

12:18.029 --> 12:20.862
start her on nutritional
supplements,
get a psych consult.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.738
Why are you reading
my program guide?

12:25.828 --> 12:28.865
It's not like you plan
on attending any
of the presentations.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.164
I like to know how much
boredom I'm missing.

12:32.919 --> 12:37.629
"Patient perceptions
of complications in
end-stage chemotherapy."

12:37.715 --> 12:39.751
You didn't tell me
you were giving a paper.

12:39.842 --> 12:40.968
And that was wrong?

12:41.052 --> 12:42.337
The last time you
presented a paper,

12:42.428 --> 12:44.840
you gave me an advance copy
and asked for feedback.

12:44.931 --> 12:49.140
And you're wondering
why I wouldn't want to
repeat that experience?

12:49.227 --> 12:51.513
Oh, look, an '80s party.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.518
Just when you think you've
left Flock of Seagulls behind
in your rear-view mirror,

12:55.608 --> 12:57.940
suddenly it's up ahead
like an undead hitchhiker.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.608
Cuddy's going.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.651
Did you pack
my Iegwarmers?

13:03.741 --> 13:07.108
If you want her,
ask her out.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.864
My God, man.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.780
She's not some
floozy in a bar,

13:11.874 --> 13:13.910
she's the floozy
I work for.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.001
There's gotta be no
radical steps here,
gotta be subtle.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.794
We happen to attend
the same party,

13:18.881 --> 13:20.712
the chat happens
to turn personal.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.291
Like the frog
in gradually
boiling water.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.546
Exactly.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.049
SheJIbe
red and delicious
before she knows it.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.381
That's fun.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.054
What could possibly
go wrong?

13:35.398 --> 13:37.229
Chase went
to the gym five
times this week.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.477
Okay.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.354
One of those times,
I followed him.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.560
What?

13:42.572 --> 13:45.655
I followed him. And, yes,
I know how humiliating
that admission is.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.073
(SCOFFS)

13:47.410 --> 13:48.445
Where'd he go?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.072
The gym. That time.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.152
But I know
that something's...

13:51.247 --> 13:52.407
I'm stopping you
right there.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.205
This is a conversation
you should be having
with Chase, not me.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.204
I've tried having
this conversation
with Chase.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.832
No sign of tears.
It's not bulimia.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.082
Is he having an affair?

14:02.675 --> 14:03.835
No.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.545
Why should I believe you?

14:05.636 --> 14:07.763
You shouldn't.
You should believe him.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.765
Baby, how are you?
Sweetie.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.011
Jordan.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.607
Normal sinus rhythm.
Heart rate's fine.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.682
BP's dropping.
DEREK: What's
happening to her?

14:20.777 --> 14:21.812
No pulse.

14:21.944 --> 14:25.186
MICHELLE: Oh, my God.
You said her
heart rate was fine.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.318
Cardiac tamponade,
drain the fluid now.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.070
DEREK: What is going on?

14:30.787 --> 14:33.199
She's bleeding
around her heart.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.209
Blood constricted
her heart muscle.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.629
She's on antiarrhythmics,
but we don't know how long
we can keep her stable.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.215
Seemed to be triggered
by stress.
Her parents had just...

14:46.302 --> 14:48.759
Did her blood pressure
drop during the
barium swallow?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.753
Dropped to 50 systolic
in three minutes.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.133
Rules out
chronic conditions.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.095
Acute conditions
limit us to toxins,
infections...

14:55.186 --> 15:00.271
Could be anything. A gas leak,
arsenic in the wallpaper,
fungus in the shower...

15:00.358 --> 15:02.474
I'll get samples
from her room
and the restaurant.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.024
HOUSE: Talk to our
little Gossip Girl.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.894
You need to know
exactly where she's been

15:05.988 --> 15:08.821
and what she's done
in the last 24 hours.

15:08.908 --> 15:09.988
Oh, lthink...

15:18.167 --> 15:20.544
Welcome to
the convention,
Dr. Perlmutter.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.869
It's my 25th
consecutive year.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.256
Perlmutter loves the '80s.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.556
(SIGHING)
Do you need me
to leave, too?

15:39.647 --> 15:41.603
You might remember
stuff she doesn't.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.433
We didn't do anything
we haven't told you about.

15:44.527 --> 15:49.612
We hung out at Jordan's
all day, and then we called
a limo to go into the city.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.361
We stopped at Bruce
Springsteen's house.

15:53.202 --> 15:56.786
Jord, don't joke
around, okay?

15:56.873 --> 16:00.115
You're really sick.
Just tell him the truth.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.418
Bruce let me play
the first electric guitar
he ever owned.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.621
My God,
why are you lying?

16:06.716 --> 16:08.707
How can you
not believe me?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.133
Turn to your right.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.971
CAMERON: Mr. Keener,
I really appreciate
you coming.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.149
Oh, it's not that much
of a hike. My room's
only six floors up.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.353
Last night,
do you remember
two girls, about 16?

16:30.448 --> 16:32.359
That table right there.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.069
They made an impression.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.492
They were hard to miss,
with the giggling
and the staring.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.661
I'm sure that happens
to you a lot.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.080
I'm sure that happens
to you a lot more.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.336
FOREMAN:
She can't control it.

16:48.424 --> 16:52.588
A bleed in her brain
is affecting her thalamus,
causing her to lie.

16:52.678 --> 16:56.091
We need to know everything.
You two were never apart?

16:57.266 --> 16:59.598
Except for when
she went to go get ice.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.516
But that couldn't
have taken very long.

17:01.604 --> 17:02.593
You don't know?

17:02.688 --> 17:04.019
It was in the
middle of the night.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.267
I woke up when she came
back into the room.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.975
And she told you
she went to get ice?

17:11.447 --> 17:13.438
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

17:30.049 --> 17:31.459
CUDDY: House.

19808.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.592
Are you sure?
They weren't specific.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.890
How much did it
cost you to rent that?

17:40.977 --> 17:42.808
It was in Wilson's bag.

17:43.104 --> 17:46.813
Dr. Perlmutter.
I read your article on
neural degeneration.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.269
(LAUGHS)
You didn't really take
that seriously, did you?

17:49.360 --> 17:51.692
I just wrote that
for the money.

17:52.572 --> 17:56.235
Well, hey, there,
Jane Fonda, would you
care to dancercise?

17:56.325 --> 17:59.283
Sorry, we were just
about to hit the floor.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.701
Thank you.

18:01.747 --> 18:02.862
Your leg?

18:02.957 --> 18:06.165
I'm okay,
as long as you don't
expect rhythm.

(CUDDYLAUGHS)

18:26.564 --> 18:29.271
You remember
the last time
we danced?

18:29.900 --> 18:32.186
Med school.
The week we met.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.360
No.

18:35.197 --> 18:39.406
I saw you in Endocrinology,
tracked you down
to the hoe-down.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.698
I meant we
met before that.
In the bookstore.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.287
Ah.

18:47.251 --> 18:50.584
My third day of school.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.208
I hand my syllabus
to the guy behind
the counter.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.836
He barely looks at me,
just skims the sheet

18:55.926 --> 18:57.791
and tells me
I'm overly ambitious,

18:57.887 --> 19:01.220
I have a chip on my shoulder
and I know how to party.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.429
I'd forgotten you
knew how to party.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.188
I said, "You're
making that up."

19:08.272 --> 19:10.558
Then you said,
"Your class schedule
is overloaded,

19:10.650 --> 19:12.891
"but none of your classes
are before 11:00,

19:12.985 --> 19:18.321
"and no one takes Professor
Lamb's course unless they
have something to prove."

19:18.407 --> 19:21.991
Because Professor Siegal
covered the same ground
and was the easier grader.

19:22.078 --> 19:26.697
I tracked you down.
Endocrinology, the party.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.249
And one thing
led to another.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.660
And then it didn't.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.505
I was gonna call you.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.254
No, don't do that.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.673
There was no expectations.
I was just as into it...

19:41.764 --> 19:44.471
I was gonna
come see you.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.425
Figure out
where things would
go from there.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.177
That was the morning
I got the call
from the dean,

19:50.272 --> 19:54.311
and I was expelled
from my first med school.
There didn't seem any point.

19:57.780 --> 20:03.241
I should go to my room
and review papers for the
infectious disease panel.

it was the best thing that
could have happened, right?

Yeah. Ijust wish
I'd been there.

come in last night.

Yes, it was almost 9:30.

to a new phase.

I tell Cuddy that I've always
been interested in her, and
she walks out of the room.

WILSON: Well, either she
just wasn't ready for that,

21:12.855 --> 21:18.020
or maybe she was just
surprised and didn't
know how to react.

21:20.488 --> 21:21.603
What are you doing?

of guiltjust now.

I didn't want
your notes before,

21:52.144 --> 21:53.680

how long. Fast forward.

22:13.374 --> 22:16.366
Stop. Rewind. Back.

Wherever she went,
she was only gone
for like five minutes.

She's holding something.

claimed it belonged
to her.

for an excuse
to knock on his door.

you're gonna say.

one of the doctors
occasionally indicted,

22:52.246 --> 22:53.656
I guess it could
affect that.

22:53.747 --> 22:59.208
Someone needs to say
what life is really like, now,
for people who are dying.

22:59.295 --> 23:00.501
What doctors
have to go through.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.670
The decisions
we have to make.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.292
Alone.
Without guidance.

23:04.383 --> 23:08.626
Someone should say that,
in an unsigned
letter to the Times.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.178
I'd be telling the truth.
I'd be saying what
we're all thinking.

Who cares?

23:12.641 --> 23:14.893
The oncology department
is subsidized
by drug companies,

23:14.977 --> 23:16.842
they don't want it
run by a murderer.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.973
We're all murderers.
We just don't have
the guts to admit...

23:19.064 --> 23:20.804
And once again,
who cares?

23:20.900 --> 23:23.016
You won't be hirable.

If there's one thing
I've learned from you,

23:25.988 --> 23:27.899
it's that I should do
what I think is right,

23:27.990 --> 23:30.606
and not worry about
the consequences.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.331
Yeah, it's worked
out great for me.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.461
I don't mean to be rude,

23:48.552 --> 23:50.588
but I'm expecting
a notes call from LA.
Can we make this quick?

23:50.679 --> 23:52.465
Did Jordan
come to your room
the other night?

23:52.556 --> 23:56.720
Let me put it another way.
We know Jordan came
to your room the other night.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.187
Look, I've tried
to be helpful.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.648
I don't know why
you want to pretend
I'm lying to you,

24:01.732 --> 24:02.721
but this is getting
too weird for me.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.397
We need
to search your room.

24:04.485 --> 24:06.646
You don't, because
she was never here.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.936
Allison, calm down.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.152

at the expense
of someone's life?

We know
she brought up
yourjournal

That was helpful.

his marriage for a one-night
stand. With a teenager.

risk their marriage for
something more serious?

24:31.428 --> 24:32.588

Fine.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.464
He doesn't care
about his marriage,
what about his career?

24:36.558 --> 24:37.764
Statutory rape
would ruin it.

24:37.851 --> 24:40.308
It's admitting
statutory rape
that could ruin it.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.728
Which is why
we'll never hear
the truth out of him.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.476
Roofies OD explains
all her symptoms.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.693
We should
start treating her
with flumazenil.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.645
Isn't the MRSA
panel going on?

24:51.740 --> 24:54.026
We got kicked out.
She started crying.

24:54.118 --> 24:58.202
Yeah, well, discussions
of urinary catheterization
will do that to me, too.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.119
The babysitter
had an emergency.

25:02.084 --> 25:05.576
Oh, how did you
like '80s Night?

25:05.671 --> 25:06.786
House talked with you?

25:08.048 --> 25:12.257
I was being
subtle about it.
You left suddenly.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.173
I know House can be
a little much sometimes.

25:15.264 --> 25:19.052
He was sweet.
I just know better
than to rely on that.

25:20.978 --> 25:21.967
He's trying.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.472
Yeah. I know.

25:25.357 --> 25:30.317
I'm a mother now.
I need a guy I can count
on every single day.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.028
That's never been House.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.993
It's not roofies.
She's bleeding
behind her kidneys.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.325
We're transfusing
another two units
packed red cells,

25:46.420 --> 25:47.830
but she keeps
springing leaks.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.048
It looks like
a toxic reaction.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.713
Keener must have
given her something.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.462
The guy's
a comic book writer,
not a drug dealer.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.589
There's a lot that
wouldn't show up on
a standard tox screen.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.841
But he's never gonna
tell us the truth.

25:58.932 --> 26:01.594
We're not going
to get the truth
out of her either.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.596
We will if we drug her.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.558
Amobarbital would
suppress her thalamus.

26:10.652 --> 26:13.985
She's on antiarrhythmics.
Amobarbital could
stop her heart.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.904
She's already dying.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.733
You're angry at me.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.864
You're taking it out on
this guy 'cause you think
he's lying to you, too,

26:21.955 --> 26:24.788
and you're going
to kill our patient
in the process.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.457
We need
to know the truth.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.045
We should call House.

26:29.129 --> 26:32.337
Yeah, he'll recommend
we take the cautious approach.

Those are gonna show up
on my credit card
at seven bucks a bag.

26:44.144 --> 26:46.180
There's an all-you-can-
eat buffet downstairs.

26:46.271 --> 26:51.015
Studies show that $10 wine
tastes better if you're
told that it costs $90.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.685
I'm sure the same
thing must be true
of grape soda.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.690
Have one.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.908
We can toast
your impending
unemployment.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.695

27:08.710 --> 27:11.326
Yes, you can sit here
running up my hotel bill,

27:11.421 --> 27:13.878
or you can go
get the woman
of your dreams.

27:14.883 --> 27:17.135
I didn't know
Angela Merkel was
attending the conference.

27:17.219 --> 27:20.677
I just spoke with Cuddy.
She doesn't think
you're reliable.

27:20.764 --> 27:25.133
And you will remain
friend-zoned
until that changes.

27:25.227 --> 27:29.140
I can't convince her that
I've changed my entire
personality in a weekend.

27:29.231 --> 27:32.098
Yeah, but you could
make the first step.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.181
What does she need?

27:33.277 --> 27:35.063
Today, a babysitter.

27:39.449 --> 27:40.780
What are you
thinking about?

27:40.868 --> 27:41.948
Fjords.

27:42.035 --> 27:46.825
You see? Seriously,
I know this is out
of your comfort zone,

27:46.915 --> 27:50.908
but don't scheme, don't...
Just do the deed...

27:51.003 --> 27:52.834
You tell me that
I gotta show her
I've changed,

27:52.921 --> 27:55.879
and yet you act like
you don't believe I can.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.127
If I can't convince
my best friend...

27:58.218 --> 28:02.507
I'm sorry, and that's...
I didn't mean...
I didn't mean...

28:04.266 --> 28:06.052
I didn't mean...

28:09.396 --> 28:10.932
(SIGHING)

28:11.398 --> 28:12.934
You drugged me.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.485
She's better off
without you.

28:24.161 --> 28:26.152
Words can hurt,
you know.

28:27.915 --> 28:31.703
I thought truth serum was
only stuff they gave
people in lame spy movies.

28:31.793 --> 28:35.081
We know you're scared,
and we know you
want to tell the truth.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.878
We're going to
help you do that.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.672
What happened between
you and Keener the night
you went up to his room?

28:44.473 --> 28:47.385
JORDAN:
/ couldn’t believe
he even talked to me.

28:49.144 --> 28:52.056
/ told him how much
his work means to me.

28:55.192 --> 29:00.027
I figured I must
sound like a moron,
but he was nice about it.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.859
He said / was special.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.244
Heart rate's increasing.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.319
140's acceptable.
Let her talk.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.280
Did he give you
anything, a drink, pills?

29:11.375 --> 29:13.741
JORDAN:
He said it was Ecstasy.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.496
But it didn’t
look like Ecstasy.

29:15.587 --> 29:19.500
And it didn’t really
make me feel how
Ecstasy usually does.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.252
CAMERON: How did it
make you feel?

29:21.343 --> 29:23.254
It just made me
really tired.

29:23.345 --> 29:26.178
What did it look like?
A capsule? Tablet?

29:26.265 --> 29:28.756
It was a tablet.
Round.

29:28.976 --> 29:30.011
Could be lithium.

29:30.811 --> 29:33.052
JORDAN:
He just started
touching me.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.722
At first, it seemed
nice, but then...

29:38.360 --> 29:40.316
I didn't want
to insult him.

29:40.404 --> 29:41.564
That's enough.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.607
I'm so sorry.

Increased periorbital

30:03.552 --> 30:06.919
It means everything
she's been saying
has been a lie.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.176
Everything?

30:11.101 --> 30:14.468
So you still don't know
what's wrong with her?

the point where we could

how to use
the morphine pump.

too much morphine

the machine only
gives out so much.

To override it,
you need to enter
a special code.

that she did.
Boy, that's neat.

Oh. Thought the dad might
have been Australian, too.

There was nothing
wrong with the oysters.
All oysters have Vibrio.

36:53.128 --> 36:56.086
But almost no one
has hemochromatosis.

36:56.464 --> 37:00.377
It’d give her a unique
susceptibility to Vibrio,
cause the swollen joints.

37:00.468 --> 37:03.676
It got attributed to bulimia,
so she got supplements.

more bleeding, more blood.

37:32.876 --> 37:37.165
So, how did you
two crazy kids hook up?

37:37.255 --> 37:40.042
I suspected
someone in accounting
was skimming money,

37:40.133 --> 37:42.124
and I wanted to
investigate quietly.

37:42.218 --> 37:46.336
And since you introduced
me to the only
detective I know...

37:46.431 --> 37:48.171
One thing
leads to another.

37:55.064 --> 37:59.023
Why keep it a secret?
Were you protecting me
in my fragile state?

37:59.110 --> 38:00.486
You think I was
an unhinged loony

38:00.570 --> 38:03.903
who was about to
go off the rails at a
badly-timed bit of news?

38:03.990 --> 38:06.732
I just don't advertise
my personal life.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.363
I needed help
with the baby,
Lucas drove up.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.160
Yeah, she was worried.

38:13.541 --> 38:16.032
A little worried.
As a friend.

38:16.836 --> 38:21.500
I had to hide in our room
and be the dirty little
secret. Kind of sucked.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.290
I told her it
wasn't necessary.

38:23.384 --> 38:26.751
So you had some hallucination
about having sex with her.

38:26.846 --> 38:29.428
I don't think
we need to talk...

38:29.516 --> 38:33.634
I mean, I imagine having
sex with women all the time.
No big deal.

38:33.728 --> 38:38.267
Though I guess if they
knew what I imagined,
it could get awkward.

38:38.358 --> 38:43.148
And I guess it's different
because in the fantasy,
she was your savior.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.270
But I mean, that was
months ago, right?

38:45.365 --> 38:47.902
All the work that
you had to do
to get straight.

38:47.992 --> 38:51.280
You've been institutionalized,
you've had way bigger
stuff to deal with.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.077
I should shut up.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.323
(SIGHING)

38:58.002 --> 39:00.209
Can I buy you
a ginger ale?

39:01.840 --> 39:04.582
Ginger ale would
be good. With lemon.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.135
lnfection's
clearing up nicely.

39:10.223 --> 39:11.679
You should be out of
here in a few days.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.677
That is wonderful.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.099
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

39:16.604 --> 39:17.855
Jack, how are you?

39:17.939 --> 39:19.179
Sweetie,

39:19.274 --> 39:23.017
your father and I think
we should reward ourselves
with a little time off.

39:23.111 --> 39:25.227
DEREK: That meeting's
gonna have to wait
a couple of weeks.

39:25.321 --> 39:27.528
We're staying here.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.731
MICHELLE:
You should think about
where you'd like to go.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.942
Honey, they're saying
the specs are off for
the whole foundation.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.412
Can you at least
come talk to him?

39:33.496 --> 39:35.202
(SIGHING)
Let me see.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.757
No. Soil engineering
report was fine.

39:47.844 --> 39:49.254
I'm used to it.

39:49.345 --> 39:52.303
So, about what
happened that night...

39:57.478 --> 40:00.891
JORDAN: / never even
got up the courage to
knock on his door.

40:09.032 --> 40:11.694
MICHELLE: Well,
you'll have to send
me their numbers.

40:12.869 --> 40:14.405
(SIGHS)

40:15.830 --> 40:17.570
CUDDY: Yay!

40:17.999 --> 40:19.489
(RACHEL LAUGHING)

40:27.008 --> 40:28.339
DOUGLAS:
You want to go driving?

40:29.177 --> 40:31.543
He looks like a guy
who'd be there every day.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.506
Mini-bar's re-stocked.
I say we grab some
pretzels for the road...

40:36.601 --> 40:38.933
When you do what I did,

40:39.020 --> 40:42.683
it's not enough
to tell yourself
you did nothing wrong.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.639
You need to hear it
from someone else.

40:44.734 --> 40:51.731
If not God or society,
a friend, otherwise
you go crazy.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.032
What you said
to me up there...

40:57.872 --> 40:59.533
Thank you.

40:59.624 --> 41:03.287
You're a good friend.
Cuddy should know that.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.335
Yeah,
you should let her know
that I drugged you

41:06.422 --> 41:10.040
so you wouldn't
confess to murder.
Let's get out of here.

41:12.345 --> 41:14.677
Someone could have
recognized you.

41:14.764 --> 41:17.972
First US conference
I've attended in 15 years.

41:18.059 --> 41:19.344
Perlmutter?

41:19.435 --> 41:22.142
Toronto,
all weekend,
airtight alibi.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.116
I'm sorry.

41:35.994 --> 41:39.111
I don't know why
I always suspect
the worst.

41:40.581 --> 41:41.832
If you say you're
not having an affair,

41:41.916 --> 41:44.703
you're not
having an affair.

41:49.215 --> 41:50.796
(SIGHING)

41:53.594 --> 41:55.175
Oh, God. You are?
I'm not.

41:55.263 --> 41:57.629
Okay. Sorry. Again.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.305
(SIGHS)

42:04.814 --> 42:06.930
If you don't wanna tell,

42:08.651 --> 42:09.936
okay.

42:12.113 --> 42:13.944
But I could help.

42:15.116 --> 42:18.153
Whatever this is,
it's eating away at you.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.778
We could get
past it together.

42:25.126 --> 42:27.208
I love you
no matter what.

42:40.183 --> 42:42.344
We lose patients sometimes.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.304
One of those patients,

42:49.525 --> 42:50.981
Dibala,

42:52.737 --> 42:55.399
we didn't actually
lose him.

43:01.537 --> 43:03.038
I killed him.
