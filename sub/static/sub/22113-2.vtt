00:00.042 --> 00:02.179
Previously on The Last Man on Earth...

00:02.203 --> 00:03.228
I'm Pamela.

00:03.253 --> 00:05.898
In here, in here, or
in here, or in here...

00:05.923 --> 00:08.398
She's all over my husband.

00:08.960 --> 00:10.796
I overheard what you said
about cutting me loose.

00:10.821 --> 00:12.426
I'll take real good care of Tandy. Bye!

00:12.462 --> 00:13.861
Look on the bright side.

00:13.897 --> 00:17.265
We have our very own island.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.913
Well, hello there.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.182
Ah, I love this song.

00:34.217 --> 00:37.552
♪ Well, it's not far down to paradise ♪

00:37.587 --> 00:40.555
♪ At least it's not for me ♪

00:40.590 --> 00:42.890
♪ If the wind is right... ♪
Come on, sing with me.

00:42.926 --> 00:44.725
You wish.

00:44.761 --> 00:47.595
Fine, be a song-pooper.

00:48.115 --> 00:51.766
Open your mouth, 'cause
I'm gonna put an ear in it.

00:54.170 --> 00:57.405
Sorry, I know that was a little corny.

00:58.741 --> 00:59.974
Well, this guy liked it.

01:00.009 --> 01:01.876
I love that joke, heh-heh-heh.

01:03.012 --> 01:04.779
What's your endgame here, Pamela?

01:04.813 --> 01:06.884
You think if you feed me enough corn,

01:06.909 --> 01:08.449
I'm just gonna suddenly forget

01:08.484 --> 01:10.751
that you stranded my pregnant
wife on a deserted island?

01:10.787 --> 01:13.254
Need I remind you, your pregnant wife...

01:13.289 --> 01:14.789
If she is indeed pregnant...

01:14.824 --> 01:17.258
Was planning to ditch me
the second they hit land.

01:17.293 --> 01:20.561
Oh, please. If you think you
have any kind of shot with me,

01:20.597 --> 01:23.226
you're insizzy in the membrizzy.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.833
Then I guess you've never
heard of Stockholm syndrome?

01:25.869 --> 01:28.769
Of course I have.

01:28.805 --> 01:31.973
But, uh, for G-Gary,
will you explain it?

01:33.124 --> 01:34.175
Sure.

01:36.913 --> 01:41.015
Gary, Stockholm syndrome
is when a hostage

01:41.050 --> 01:43.317
starts to sympathize
with their captor...

01:43.353 --> 01:44.619
Uh, uh, with their captor!

01:44.654 --> 01:47.123
Yeah, uh-huh. Know it well.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.823
That's never gonna happen.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.759
Well, it is very common.

01:51.794 --> 01:57.298
In fact, sometimes people
even... fall in love.

01:57.528 --> 02:00.529
Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?!

02:02.771 --> 02:04.324
Wait a minute.

02:05.364 --> 02:08.042
She'd love that, wouldn't she?

02:08.077 --> 02:10.511
Gary, call the doctor

02:10.545 --> 02:13.314
and tell him to put on
a fresh pot of coffee,

02:13.349 --> 02:16.851
'cause the Tandyman's feeling
a little under the weather.

02:16.886 --> 02:20.988
Yeah, looks like I'm coming down

02:21.024 --> 02:23.391
with "Stocko syndome."

02:28.551 --> 02:30.655
Well, I can barely
see the yacht anymore.

02:31.367 --> 02:32.867
What do I do?! What do I do?!

02:32.902 --> 02:34.368
There's no time to panic.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.870
Just have to figure out a plan.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.204
Melissa's right. Okay, let's see.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.407
Erica, quick, hand me that fondue pot.

02:39.442 --> 02:41.542
Uh, Jasper, that chocolate bar.

02:41.577 --> 02:43.648
Now, has anybody seen any matches?

02:43.673 --> 02:46.047
Todd, are you sure
you're working on a plan?

02:46.082 --> 02:48.649
'Cause it sounds like you're
just making chocolate fondue.

02:48.685 --> 02:50.010
It's called brain food, Gail.

02:50.035 --> 02:52.486
I mean, it's like you
never made a plan before.

02:52.522 --> 02:54.155
You know. Am-am I alone on this?

02:58.861 --> 03:00.394
What the gol is that?

03:01.427 --> 03:02.430
Hello?

03:02.465 --> 03:04.532
Somebody there?

03:05.234 --> 03:06.600
Ow.

03:06.636 --> 03:07.802
Show yourself!

03:12.031 --> 03:14.041
Stay here. I'm gonna check it out.

03:15.537 --> 03:16.942
Be careful, Todd.

03:25.488 --> 03:27.054
Stop right there.

03:27.090 --> 03:28.889
Okay.

03:42.572 --> 03:44.171
What the hell is he doing?

03:48.344 --> 03:50.611
Good God, he's going right in there.

03:50.646 --> 03:52.980
Oh, I don't like the looks of this.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.091
It's okay, guys!

04:02.124 --> 04:04.981
He just wants to touch
everybody's faces.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.829
- No, no. - No,
no, no. - Ah...

04:08.865 --> 04:11.354
- Oh, you're real.
- Hey, guys,

04:11.451 --> 04:13.150
this is, uh, Glenn.

04:14.670 --> 04:16.504
I-I'm sorry, I just, I...

04:16.539 --> 04:19.305
I never thought this
day would come. I... I...

04:19.341 --> 04:21.959
I-I'm being... I'm being rescued.

04:22.234 --> 04:25.346
I'm going home. I'm going home!

04:28.834 --> 04:31.168
When does your boat come back?

04:35.388 --> 04:36.671
Guys?

04:52.341 --> 04:55.743
Okay, Gary, here goes nothing.

04:57.482 --> 04:58.846
Gary...

04:58.881 --> 05:00.981
how long have we been on this boat?

05:01.017 --> 05:04.136
I mean, it feels like months,
but that can't be right.

05:04.161 --> 05:06.554
I mean, I'm so disoriented.

05:06.589 --> 05:09.690
Up is down, day is night...

05:09.725 --> 05:11.425
hate is love.

05:11.667 --> 05:14.728
I feel so different in so many ways.

05:14.764 --> 05:16.297
Take, for instance, Carol.

05:16.332 --> 05:18.132
I mean, I care about her,

05:18.167 --> 05:20.568
but it's feeling more
like a friendship now.

05:20.603 --> 05:21.946
And you're not gonna believe this,

05:21.971 --> 05:25.005
but you know that woman
Pamela from the boat?

05:25.041 --> 05:29.029
Man, I'm crushing on
her so hard right now.

05:30.412 --> 05:32.098
Yes, it's a boner, Gary.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.047
You'd get one, too,

05:33.082 --> 05:35.015
if you couldn't stop
thinking about Pamela.

05:35.051 --> 05:37.351
Oh, God, I'm so confused.

05:37.386 --> 05:39.353
Look, until I can sort out my feelings,

05:39.388 --> 05:42.423
I'm just gonna keep on
pretending like I hate Pamela.

05:42.458 --> 05:45.192
Oh, my God, she's coming,
she's coming, she's coming.

05:45.699 --> 05:47.695
Tandy?

05:48.105 --> 05:49.363
You hungry?

05:49.671 --> 05:51.138
Get bent!

05:51.433 --> 05:54.011
Wow, you sound like
you're very upset with me.

05:54.036 --> 05:55.813
Duh, duh!

05:56.923 --> 05:59.540
Still thinking about... what's her name?

05:59.575 --> 06:02.109
Her name, for your information,

06:02.145 --> 06:04.778
is Pamela... uh, Karen... Carol!

06:04.814 --> 06:08.249
Oh, that's right...
Carol Andrew Pil-Pamela...

06:08.284 --> 06:10.084
Uh, basian! Pilbasian!

06:10.119 --> 06:11.886
Carol Pamela Pilbasian!

06:11.921 --> 06:14.088
Carol Andrew Pilbasian!

06:14.123 --> 06:17.858
Get out of here! Get out of here!

06:17.894 --> 06:20.361
All right, if that's what you want.

06:20.396 --> 06:22.963
That's what I want.

06:29.906 --> 06:31.906
The trap's been set.

06:32.582 --> 06:37.337
Looks like our mouse has
a weakness for cheese.

06:38.814 --> 06:40.748
Tandy cheese.

06:41.951 --> 06:45.564
Tandy! Tandy!

06:45.589 --> 06:47.980
So, this is my place.

06:48.005 --> 06:50.324
This is the main living
quarters over here,

06:50.359 --> 06:52.760
and I have a seating area right there.

06:52.795 --> 06:56.263
And my toilet's right
there, where Todd's standing.

06:56.299 --> 06:57.531
Geez.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.668
What's this?

07:01.294 --> 07:03.840
That is really nothing.

07:03.865 --> 07:06.407
Oh, gosh, I know what this
probably looks like to you,

07:06.442 --> 07:08.676
but this is not a sex doll.

07:08.711 --> 07:10.880
Okay, I was lonely, and I created her

07:10.905 --> 07:12.338
to have someone to talk to.

07:12.363 --> 07:13.147
Oh.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.348
And then the lines did blur,

07:14.383 --> 07:15.649
and she became a sex doll.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.619
But she did not start
as a sex doll, okay?

07:18.654 --> 07:20.803
And I think that that's
an important distinction.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.623
You can probably tell that I modeled her

07:22.658 --> 07:24.369
after Eva Mendes.

07:24.394 --> 07:26.160
Yeah, she was a beautiful woman.

07:27.017 --> 07:28.728
Was? What do you mean?

07:30.916 --> 07:32.800
Oh, no.

07:32.835 --> 07:34.868
She didn't have a bunch
of work done, did she?

07:34.904 --> 07:37.538
Uh... uh, Glenn,

07:37.563 --> 07:39.582
how long have you been on this island?

07:40.098 --> 07:41.715
About five years.

07:41.949 --> 07:43.377
Oh, my God.

07:44.067 --> 07:46.880
Is there something
you're not telling me?

07:46.916 --> 07:48.482
What happened to her face?

07:50.186 --> 07:51.291
It...

07:53.837 --> 07:55.856
- died.
- Yeah.

07:56.189 --> 07:59.326
And her body joined it.

07:59.362 --> 08:01.905
Oh, God, no. How did that happen?

08:02.124 --> 08:05.332
No, no, don't tell me. I
do not handle death well.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.702
Gosling must be devastated.

08:10.288 --> 08:12.406
Well, I hope your brows are ready...

08:12.441 --> 08:14.041
Latisse time.

08:15.396 --> 08:17.194
Hey, girl.

08:21.124 --> 08:22.916
I guess you're not mad at me anymore.

08:22.952 --> 08:25.123
Oh, I'm super mad!

08:25.148 --> 08:27.721
And I want to give you a spanking.

08:28.184 --> 08:29.923
Get over here.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.760
This is moving a little
faster than I thought.

08:34.136 --> 08:35.361
Yeah?

08:35.398 --> 08:38.832

Trix are for kids, and I'm 43 years old.

09:32.036 --> 09:34.054
I wasn't born yesterday, you know.

09:34.090 --> 09:37.858
Good, 'cause I would
never do this to a baby.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.132
Tandy. Tandy.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.500
Yes, my love?

09:46.972 --> 09:50.437
Do you think that
there's a chance that...

09:51.574 --> 09:53.507
that I bought any of that?

09:54.160 --> 09:56.176
Bought what, my love?

09:56.212 --> 09:57.206
Stop it!

09:57.231 --> 09:58.789
I was alone in a bunker for three years,

09:58.814 --> 09:59.980
so you'll excuse me if I'm

10:00.015 --> 10:02.173
Michael Jackson's doctor right now...

10:03.157 --> 10:05.774
All out of patience.

10:06.989 --> 10:08.622
Please don't shoot me. Please
don't... please, please...

10:08.657 --> 10:10.023
Let me be direct.

10:10.059 --> 10:12.926
You're mine now. No more games.

10:13.095 --> 10:14.327
Do you hear me?

10:14.664 --> 10:18.966
Loud, clear, and wet from urine.

10:22.163 --> 10:25.141
Think, Tandy, think.
Every minute that passes,

10:25.166 --> 10:28.300
you sail further away from
your wife and unborn child.

10:28.336 --> 10:33.105
Oh, Carol, everything
I see reminds me of you.

10:34.190 --> 10:36.842
Your various creams and ointments...

10:38.470 --> 10:40.370
your nipples, of course.

10:41.282 --> 10:44.617
Always giving me grief about
my razor-sharp toenails.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.987
Speaking of razor-sharp,

10:48.022 --> 10:50.589
I just need to find
something razor-sharp

10:50.625 --> 10:52.750
to cut through these damn ropes.

10:54.428 --> 10:56.428
Wait a minute.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.368
Bingo.

11:05.627 --> 11:06.639
Hey, Glenn?

11:06.674 --> 11:07.673
Hmm?

11:07.708 --> 11:08.774
You know, we-we have something

11:08.809 --> 11:11.010
pretty heavy we got to tell you.

11:12.491 --> 11:14.421
Sure. Go ahead.

11:14.446 --> 11:16.815
Well, y-you know, you seem
like an optimistic guy.

11:16.851 --> 11:19.184
You know, someone who
sees the bright side,

11:19.553 --> 11:23.567
even on the... darkest of days.

11:23.592 --> 11:26.663
Only 100% of the time.

11:26.688 --> 11:27.860
Good, trust me, 'cause.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.538
- And you know why?
- Wh...

11:29.563 --> 11:32.631
Because I always picture that moment...

11:34.543 --> 11:35.739
Moment?

11:36.176 --> 11:37.369
The moment I'm able to walk through

11:37.405 --> 11:39.412
my front door again.

11:41.245 --> 11:43.350
The first one to greet me is Tommy.

11:44.655 --> 11:46.687
He's my oldest.

11:46.714 --> 11:48.480
A little worker bee.

11:48.897 --> 11:51.951
Next, little Penny comes
bounding down the steps.

11:52.167 --> 11:54.234
She was our miracle baby.

11:54.259 --> 11:57.460
Doctor said she wouldn't
make it to her 19th birthday.

11:58.055 --> 12:01.126
I told that story at
her 19th birthday party.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.697
And then little Dougie
comes marching in.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.067
He was our surprise.

12:08.688 --> 12:10.502
Spitting image of his mom.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.671
Which is a little
painful, because she died

12:12.707 --> 12:14.907
bringing him into this world.

12:19.786 --> 12:20.959
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:20.984 --> 12:23.785
Uh, what was it you
wanted to talk to me about?

12:24.503 --> 12:25.632
Uh...

12:28.718 --> 12:30.055
I, uh...

12:33.056 --> 12:34.259
farted.

12:34.802 --> 12:36.101
Yeah.

12:36.126 --> 12:37.663
But it-it was a while ago, you know,

12:37.698 --> 12:39.465
so it's kind of a moot point now.

12:42.069 --> 12:45.270
Do you know that I farted
four times during that story?

12:45.306 --> 12:46.638
Yeah.

13:04.225 --> 13:06.191
Now I just got to, like, launch this

13:06.227 --> 13:08.027
over to the other side of the boat,

13:08.062 --> 13:09.895
and as she goes to check it out,

13:09.930 --> 13:13.399
then I grab the gun, and, boom...

13:13.434 --> 13:15.067
it's Tandy time.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.804
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

13:18.839 --> 13:20.639
What the hell?

13:20.674 --> 13:22.174
Oh, God, what do I do? What do I do?!

13:23.511 --> 13:26.412
Hold it right there.

13:27.205 --> 13:28.539
Put him down!

13:28.564 --> 13:31.984
Or what? You shoot me, he
goes right in the water.

13:32.322 --> 13:34.386
Fine. He's an excellent swimmer.

13:34.728 --> 13:36.755
Well, tell me, is he an excellent

13:36.791 --> 13:39.491
being-eaten-avoider?

13:39.999 --> 13:41.493
You wouldn't dare.

13:42.046 --> 13:44.696
Tell me you can look into those
sweet little eyes and do it.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.901
You're right.

13:48.936 --> 13:50.602
But that won't be a problem...

13:50.638 --> 13:52.938
if I start with his butt.

13:52.973 --> 13:54.273
Don't you dare eat his butt!

13:54.308 --> 13:55.674
I'm about to do it. I'm about to do it.

13:55.709 --> 13:56.675
Put him down, let him go.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.243
I swear, I love the taste of dog meat.

13:58.279 --> 13:59.244
I will shoot your face.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.180
I'll eat his butt. I will eat his butt!

14:01.215 --> 14:02.915
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Put the gun down!

14:02.950 --> 14:05.517
Okay, okay. Okay.

14:05.748 --> 14:07.080
Kick the gun over to me.

14:10.113 --> 14:11.512
Monster.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.959
Oh, thank God.

14:13.994 --> 14:15.918
Carol, I'm coming for you.

14:15.943 --> 14:18.797
Just got to get back to the island.

14:26.087 --> 14:28.675
Oh... farts.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.525
How you holding up, Carol?

14:36.884 --> 14:40.219
I'm starting to think that
we're never gonna get rescued.

14:40.609 --> 14:42.387
Don't give up hope.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.437
Sometimes that's all you got.

14:44.960 --> 14:45.891
Yeah.

14:46.341 --> 14:47.474
Look at me.

14:47.499 --> 14:50.128
I should've given up years ago.

14:50.164 --> 14:52.731
But I know that one day I'm
gonna see a plane out there

14:52.766 --> 14:54.473
or a passing ship,

14:54.498 --> 14:56.401
and I'm just gonna run up
to the top of that hill,

14:56.437 --> 14:58.136
and I'm gonna light my signal fire

14:58.172 --> 14:59.471
- and they're gonna...
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:59.506 --> 15:00.973
You have a signal fire?

15:00.998 --> 15:03.408
Well, what kind of man on
a deserted island would I be

15:03.444 --> 15:04.509
without a signal fire?

15:04.545 --> 15:05.811
We got to go light it for Tandy.

15:05.846 --> 15:07.980
Carol, that boat is long gone.

15:08.015 --> 15:09.915
You only get one shot
with the signal fire.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.583
We have to save it for
a plane or for a boat.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.518
But it's not gonna happen.

15:13.554 --> 15:14.753
Not with that attitude, no.

15:14.788 --> 15:15.988
No, it will never, ever happen.

15:16.023 --> 15:17.053
Okay, I'm done with your negativity.

15:17.078 --> 15:18.657
But please, just light the fire.

15:18.692 --> 15:20.092
Look, I know you're upset about
your husband, but we can't...

15:20.127 --> 15:21.493
But, Glenn, it is our only hope!

15:21.528 --> 15:24.630
- How do you know that?
- Because everyone on Earth is dead!

15:28.100 --> 15:30.285
There was a horrible virus...

15:31.305 --> 15:33.071
and it took the whole world.

15:35.075 --> 15:36.975
And we're all that's left.

15:40.183 --> 15:42.848
So there's no planes.

15:42.883 --> 15:44.716
There's no boats.

15:47.461 --> 15:49.328
Except that one.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.106
Oh, Jeremy.

16:08.142 --> 16:10.642
What have we become?

16:20.760 --> 16:23.368
I didn't want to have
to tell you like that.

16:25.344 --> 16:29.361
Five years without a
passing boat or a plane.

16:32.446 --> 16:34.012
I was just being foolish.

16:34.037 --> 16:36.805
You were being hopeful.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.837
And sometimes hope's all we have.

16:40.121 --> 16:43.073
I'm so sorry for taking yours away.

16:53.654 --> 16:55.751
I guess we have a fire to start.

17:03.464 --> 17:05.030
Jeremy.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.531
I knew I shouldn't have
given you that bowl of wine.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.301
What?

17:21.882 --> 17:23.749
Tandy.

17:25.752 --> 17:27.919
There's something you should see.

17:37.836 --> 17:39.627
Care Bear.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.335
Tandy!

17:44.268 --> 17:46.872
Tandy!

17:56.450 --> 17:59.351
Where are you, Tandy?

18:10.415 --> 18:12.264
Tandy.

18:12.299 --> 18:15.345
Tandy! Tandy!

18:15.370 --> 18:18.437
Tandy!

18:19.009 --> 18:20.197
Carol!

18:20.222 --> 18:21.355
Tandy!

18:23.019 --> 18:25.686
- Oh. Mmm.
- Mmm.

18:26.124 --> 18:27.932
I thought I would never see you again.

18:27.957 --> 18:29.256
I knew you'd give me a sign.

18:29.292 --> 18:31.025
Well, that was actually Glenn.

18:31.060 --> 18:32.452
Glenn?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.429
Hello, Tandy.

18:35.465 --> 18:37.398
I've heard nothing but
lovely things about you.

18:37.433 --> 18:39.867
- Thanks, Glenn.
- Hi.

18:50.980 --> 18:53.231
I say we leave her the hell here.

18:53.256 --> 18:54.949
You're asking me, that's
letting her off easy.

18:54.984 --> 18:57.184
Well, look, I'll do whatever
the group thinks is best,

18:57.220 --> 18:58.452
but just so you know,

18:58.488 --> 19:00.521
after I threatened to eat
her dog's butt to death

19:00.556 --> 19:02.056
and got the gun away from her,

19:02.091 --> 19:04.358
she turned into a real team player.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.627
So, what, are we supposed to just

19:05.652 --> 19:07.291
let her back on the boat, Tandy?

19:07.316 --> 19:08.963
That'd be like buying Freddy Krueger

19:08.998 --> 19:10.631
a condominium on Elm Street.

19:10.666 --> 19:14.702
I will never forgive that
woman, so my vote is a hard nay.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.237
Hi.

19:17.530 --> 19:19.306
Look, I know why you all hate me.

19:19.342 --> 19:20.975
Right now I'm not too
crazy about me, either.

19:21.010 --> 19:22.643
Bless you.

19:23.944 --> 19:27.782
To be honest, I'm not quite
sure why I did what I did.

19:28.317 --> 19:30.418
I'd love to blame it on being
in the bunker for so long,

19:30.453 --> 19:33.059
but the truth is, I had
problems before that, too.

19:34.832 --> 19:35.923
Starting to realize

19:35.958 --> 19:37.992
maybe I'm just not meant
to be around people.

19:39.167 --> 19:41.328
So I understand if you want to leave me.

19:41.353 --> 19:44.331
Um, I'd probably do the same.

19:44.367 --> 19:46.500
If I could just ask one favor.

19:46.536 --> 19:48.402
Could you please take Jeremy with you?

19:48.438 --> 19:49.570
He didn't do anything wrong.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.072
Please?

19:51.107 --> 19:53.193
Yeah, sure.

19:53.218 --> 19:54.992
Oh, thank you.

19:58.271 --> 19:59.847
Oh.

19:59.882 --> 20:02.197
Well, this is it.

20:02.222 --> 20:04.188
We've had so many... oh, there he goes.

20:04.554 --> 20:06.087
Okay.

20:07.424 --> 20:08.456
Well...

20:09.369 --> 20:10.659
safe travels.

20:12.727 --> 20:16.362
- Well, that made that decision easy.
- Yup.

20:16.387 --> 20:17.965
So, is that it?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.700
You guys just gonna leave her here?

20:19.735 --> 20:21.368
I mean, you lived here for years

20:21.404 --> 20:23.321
and look at you.

20:23.346 --> 20:25.654
I had the hope of being rescued.

20:25.990 --> 20:29.324
Can't imagine being left
here without that hope.

20:39.589 --> 20:41.404
Okay, fine, she can come.

20:42.425 --> 20:44.325
But on one condition.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.628
Thank you!

20:47.663 --> 20:50.261
Thank you! You won't regret this!

21:00.376 --> 21:02.510
It's a little cold out here.

21:06.719 --> 21:07.882
It's bumpy.

21:12.555 --> 21:14.155
Can someone hand me a blanket?

21:18.294 --> 21:20.027
S-So...

21:24.534 --> 21:26.000
Did I mention that I'm sorry?
