00:07.659 --> 00:10.314
<i>When the body's
exposed to rising temperatures, </i>

00:10.358 --> 00:14.275
<i>it has the ability
to cool itself down. </i>

00:14.318 --> 00:16.190
<i>We sweat,
our blood vessels dilate, </i>

00:16.233 --> 00:17.974
<i> and our heart rate increases...</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:20.063
Mom! Why don't we have
air-conditioning?

00:20.107 --> 00:21.717
Because
we live in Seattle.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.284
Please go get dressed.

00:23.327 --> 00:26.287
<i>...and our body releases
as much excess heat as it can. </i>

00:26.330 --> 00:28.941
I thought Gen Z was all about
climate conservation.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.769
Well, they're all about
speaking their minds

00:30.813 --> 00:33.598
and spot-on hashtags.

00:33.642 --> 00:36.732
Oh, and calling you "bestie"
as an insult.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.690
Do you know what the temperature
is in Minnesota right now?

00:38.734 --> 00:40.866
73 degrees.
No heat waves.

00:40.910 --> 00:43.086
You're as bad as the kids.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.001
Is it gonna be weird?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.481
I can't do Minnesota

00:46.524 --> 00:48.396
and be chief of
general surgery

00:48.439 --> 00:50.702
and be chief of
the residency program.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.400
Richard will
have to understand.

00:52.443 --> 00:54.706
Well, I'm not talking
about Richard.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.231
She's like my sister.
You're like my sister.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.623
I just --
I don't want it to be weird.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.234
Then stop making it weird.

01:00.277 --> 01:03.106
<i> But when the temperature starts
to inch above 100 degrees, </i>

01:03.150 --> 01:04.542
<i>our bodies have to
work overtime... </i>

01:04.586 --> 01:05.935
I have back-to-back
craniotomies,

01:05.978 --> 01:07.893
and then I have that video call
with Kai Bartley.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.112
<i>...leading to heat exhaustion.</i>

01:09.156 --> 01:11.114
I know --
I can't tell anyone.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.594
73 degrees, Mer.

01:12.637 --> 01:15.510
Maybe we just move to Minnesota
and become lake people.

01:15.553 --> 01:17.903
Moving to Minnesota?
Great.

01:17.947 --> 01:20.341
Not moving. Just might take
a few more trips there.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.125
Got it.
- Glad we discussed it.
- Mm.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.474
Uh, kiddie pool?

01:23.518 --> 01:25.215
Yes, thank you.
Out back.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.391
<i>We become nauseated,
dizzy, and confused. </i>

01:27.435 --> 01:30.481
It's one of Link's lifelong
dreams to cure Parkinson's.

01:30.525 --> 01:33.093
I know --
I can't tell anyone.

01:33.136 --> 01:36.444
<i>And we fight like hell to cool
down before it's too late. </i>

01:42.363 --> 01:44.756
Hey. I got the last window unit,
and I installed it myself.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.628
Oh.
More burn pits?

01:46.671 --> 01:48.586
Yeah, I found some
anecdotal accounts,

01:48.630 --> 01:51.154
but no official documentation
about pulmonary fibrosis.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.287
And Noah is still
not answering.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.419
Well, he was pretty clear that
he didn't want treatment.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.073
Yeah, I know.
I just...

01:57.117 --> 01:58.988
I can't stop thinking about how
it could have been us, you know?

01:59.031 --> 02:00.337
I know.

02:01.904 --> 02:03.949
It's over 100 degrees
outside.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.734
Did you not read
my e-mail?

02:05.777 --> 02:07.127
I mean, not only is today
grand rounds,

02:07.170 --> 02:09.085
but it is also
Silly Hat Day!

02:09.129 --> 02:10.913
Bailey said that she wanted
better morale around here.

02:10.956 --> 02:12.088
I said that
I agreed with her.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.656
So she appointed me
Ambassador of Fun.

02:14.699 --> 02:16.701
You?
Ambassador of Fun?

02:16.745 --> 02:18.442
I'm fun!

02:20.662 --> 02:22.490
Whoa.
Teddy...

02:22.533 --> 02:24.274
No. Okay.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.886
Hey, Teddy, come on.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.543
See?

02:32.587 --> 02:34.110
Fun.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.027
Who do you
think it is?

02:38.070 --> 02:39.724
Definitely someone big.

02:39.768 --> 02:42.684
Maybe it's
Pier Cristoforo Giulianotti.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.817
He pretty much invented
robotic surgery.

02:45.861 --> 02:48.124
Hey, Dr. Wilson, do you know
who's doing our grand rounds?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.517
Just because
I have to slum it

02:49.560 --> 02:51.432
in the residents' lounge
with all of you

02:51.475 --> 02:54.130
doesn't mean I can just give out
privileged information.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.350
You don't know who it is,
do you?

02:56.393 --> 02:58.656
I have important
work to do.

02:58.700 --> 02:59.918
Did you know that
excessive heat

02:59.962 --> 03:01.659
presents huge risks
in pregnant women?

03:01.703 --> 03:03.008
Including Braxton-Hicks.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.227
They announced who it is.

03:06.098 --> 03:07.839
You've got to
be kidding me.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.232
Oh!

03:10.755 --> 03:12.192
Mm!

03:13.497 --> 03:15.934
Good morning.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.414
Welcome back, Grey.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.633
Hey!
Woman over P.A.: <i>
Dr. Tracy Seip to Recovery.</i>

03:18.676 --> 03:20.112
How'd you know I was back?

03:20.156 --> 03:21.897
I had a feeling. <i>Dr. Seip to Recovery.</i>

03:21.940 --> 03:23.855
I saw you getting out of
your car in the parking lot.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.379
Oh.

03:25.422 --> 03:26.423
You brought me coffee.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.208
Hot coffee.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.774
In triple-digit weather.

03:29.818 --> 03:30.819
Iced coffee
isn't really coffee.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.821
It's just
coffee-flavored water.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.475
Not a fan of the heat,
I see.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.303
There's more sheep
than people in Ireland,

03:36.346 --> 03:38.435
so I like weather
that goes with hats and gloves

03:38.479 --> 03:39.349
and scarves
and the like.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.179
How's my friend Austin?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.050
No idea,
to be honest.

03:45.094 --> 03:46.313
Literally everything's
a secret on him.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.706
Basically not even
allowed to ask.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.839
I'm a few years
away from that,

03:50.882 --> 03:52.710
but I'm definitely not
looking forward to it.

03:52.754 --> 03:55.496
Well, enjoy your kids speaking
to you while you still can.

03:55.539 --> 03:58.499
Well, they're really mad at me
right now

03:58.542 --> 04:00.152
because they're adjusting
to the idea that

04:00.196 --> 04:02.067
I may spend half the week
in Minnesota.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.373
I'm adjusting to that idea,
as well.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.548
- Late!
- None of us like it.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.028
Late! Excuse me!
Late!

04:06.071 --> 04:07.682
<i>Cardio Tech Room 342.</i>

04:07.725 --> 04:10.946
- <i>Cardio Tech Room 342.
- Have you, uh,
told her yet?</i>

04:10.989 --> 04:12.382
No.

04:12.426 --> 04:13.688
Webber?

04:13.731 --> 04:16.343
No. And I don't like
this line of questioning.

04:16.386 --> 04:17.648
Thank you
for the coffee.

04:17.692 --> 04:18.867
Have a great day.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.833
- It's locked.
- Why would it be locked?

04:28.877 --> 04:31.619
Welcome to grand rounds.

04:31.662 --> 04:34.491
This is not your typical
grand rounds.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.014
There's no lecture hall.

04:36.058 --> 04:37.755
There are
no slide-show presentations.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.802
This is grand rounds
on its feet.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.194
What does that mean?

04:43.457 --> 04:47.504
It means...
you'll be coming with me.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.158
Nice to meet everyone.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.986
I'm Dr. Addison Montgomery.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.295
And you must be the group

04:55.338 --> 04:57.340
that's been
screwing up the program.

04:57.384 --> 04:58.733
Uh...

04:58.776 --> 05:00.343
Kidding.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.000
- Oh, my.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.349
Follow her, people!

05:06.393 --> 05:07.437
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

05:11.180 --> 05:12.529
Mm.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.804
- Ohh.
- Woman over P.A.: <i>Dr. Robinson
to Nuclear Medicine. </i>

05:26.848 --> 05:29.111
<i>Dr. Robinson
to Nuclear Medicine. </i>

05:30.591 --> 05:33.115
Do I look like a batch
of raw cookie dough to you?

05:33.158 --> 05:34.725
Why are you trying
to bake me alive?

05:34.769 --> 05:36.379
Let these
automatic doors close.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.382
Woman over P.A.: <i>
Dr. Mahoney to the ER.</i>

05:39.426 --> 05:41.341
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the ER.</i>

05:41.384 --> 05:42.733
Chief?

05:42.777 --> 05:45.606
Dr. Altman says that you put her
in charge of "fun"

05:45.649 --> 05:48.391
and that
I have to wear this.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.219
I'm starting to think

05:50.262 --> 05:54.136
the heat may have influenced
my decision-making.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.747
<i>Dr. Eisenberg, 4673.
Dr. Eisenberg, 4673. </i>

05:58.401 --> 05:59.446
Hold still, please.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.186
Dr. Lin,
how are you settling in?

06:01.230 --> 06:03.101
Besides being told
to wear a hat to work

06:03.145 --> 06:05.495
on a 100-degree day, just fine.
Thank you.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.279
Ow! Ow! Ooh!

06:07.323 --> 06:08.803
Dare I ask?

06:08.846 --> 06:10.457
Second-degree burns to
the buttocks and upper thigh.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.067
Needs debriding.

06:12.110 --> 06:13.503
My buddy dared me to fry an egg
on the sidewalk

06:13.547 --> 06:15.549
for our web channel,
NakedBroStuff.

06:15.592 --> 06:16.680
And I fell on my butt.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.290
- Naked.
- For more views.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.815
And it worked, bro.
That egg got full-on fried.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.730
Yeah, he also fried
through his epidermis.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.558
Epic fail because of the burns
and the blisters,

06:24.601 --> 06:25.733
but look at
how many likes we got.

06:25.776 --> 06:26.864
We're gonna go viral.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.258
Dude, check this out.

06:29.301 --> 06:30.955
Some chick gets shot off
the back of a Jet Ski

06:30.999 --> 06:31.956
and the water went
straight up her --

06:32.000 --> 06:34.002
"Some chick?"

06:34.045 --> 06:36.439
This will hurt a lot less
if you hold still

06:36.483 --> 06:38.485
and stop referring to women
as baby birds.

06:39.964 --> 06:42.227
Where are all of
the residents today?

06:42.271 --> 06:44.752
There's been monumental progress
made in infertility,

06:44.795 --> 06:46.667
but there is much
more work to be done.

06:46.710 --> 06:49.452
With my background in obstetrics
and medical genetics...

06:49.496 --> 06:50.888
And as one of
the foremost

06:50.932 --> 06:52.716
neonatal surgeons
in the country.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.675
...I will always endeavor
to find more options

06:54.718 --> 06:56.546
for women who want
to become mothers.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.243
Why isn't her grand rounds
for OB?

06:58.287 --> 06:59.462
Damn it!
Save me a spot.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.377
I'll be back.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.380
Fix your face.
It's Addison Forbes Montgomery.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.990
Apparently, she and Grey
have a "history."

07:06.034 --> 07:08.558
And whatever happened,
I'm Team Grey.

07:08.602 --> 07:11.822
I heard Dr. Grey cheated with
her husband, Dr. Shepherd.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.781
You mean Dr. Grey's husband,
Derek Shepherd?

07:13.824 --> 07:16.392
No. M-Maybe.
I'm confused.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.915
- Uh-huh.
- I heard he was married
to both of them.

07:17.959 --> 07:18.916
Probably not
at the same time.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.483
Would you guys shut up?

07:20.527 --> 07:21.571
You.

07:22.398 --> 07:24.356
Middle left.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.357
Yeah, you.

07:25.401 --> 07:26.794
What's your name?

07:26.837 --> 07:27.795
Schmitt?

07:27.838 --> 07:29.927
Is that a question?
No?

07:29.971 --> 07:32.016
Schmitt, what are the vessels
found in the broad ligament?

07:32.060 --> 07:33.801
Um, blood vessels
to the ovaries,

07:33.844 --> 07:35.716
fallopian tubes,
and uterus?

07:35.759 --> 07:37.369
Uterus --
not a question.

07:39.023 --> 07:40.503
Correct.
Congratulations.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.765
You're presenting.

07:45.334 --> 07:48.293
Today's case is
a groundbreaking procedure

07:48.337 --> 07:50.513
that has the potential
to change the game

07:50.557 --> 07:52.820
for both fertility
and childbirth.

07:52.863 --> 07:55.518
I will be performing
Grey-Sloan Memorial's

07:55.562 --> 07:58.652
first surgical
uterine transplant.

07:58.695 --> 07:59.609
Go ahead, Dr. Schmitt.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.263
Oh, on my feet.
Okay.

08:01.306 --> 08:04.309
Um...Tovah Freedman,
33 years old.

08:04.353 --> 08:07.356
G-4, P-zero.

08:07.399 --> 08:10.315
Had a complete hysterectomy
two years ago this January.

08:10.359 --> 08:12.535
Secondary to
a placental abruption

08:12.579 --> 08:14.232
in the second trimester.

08:14.276 --> 08:16.496
Taking out the uterus was
unavoidable with the hemorrhage.

08:16.539 --> 08:17.671
We couldn't save the baby,

08:17.714 --> 08:20.151
but Tovah really wanted
to be a mother.

08:21.109 --> 08:23.067
I was the youngest of five,
and, yet,

08:23.111 --> 08:25.330
I was always the mom
when we played house.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.813
And when I found out that
Jonathan was also one of five,

08:29.857 --> 08:33.556
it was... <i>
b'shert.</i>

08:33.600 --> 08:35.079
"Meant to be."

08:35.123 --> 08:36.603
In Yiddish.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.343
I had my first miscarriage

08:38.387 --> 08:40.432
about six months
after we were married.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.565
Then it was pretty much
one a year

08:42.609 --> 08:44.654
until we made it to
the second trimester,

08:44.698 --> 08:47.744
and I had the abruption
and lost the baby.

08:47.788 --> 08:50.007
And then it got worse.

08:50.051 --> 08:53.271
Jonathan was diagnosed
with malignant mesothelioma.

08:53.315 --> 08:56.884
And before he did chemo,
we froze his sperm.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.233
When Jonathan passed away,

08:58.276 --> 08:59.887
I couldn't imagine
being a parent without him.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.935
But then I heard about
Dr. Montgomery's clinical trial

09:04.979 --> 09:07.155
and I realized that

09:07.198 --> 09:10.550
I could be
the mom I was meant to be...

09:10.593 --> 09:12.943
and maybe even bring
my and Jonathan's baby

09:12.987 --> 09:15.163
into the world myself.

09:15.206 --> 09:17.731
Tovah is the last patient
in my trial,

09:17.774 --> 09:19.210
and her family's
here in Seattle,

09:19.254 --> 09:21.125
so she has
a solid support system.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.650
If all goes well,
I will have met my criteria

09:23.693 --> 09:26.087
to publish my first round
of patient results,

09:26.130 --> 09:28.002
which means
we're that much closer

09:28.045 --> 09:31.092
to changing fertility
all over the world.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.616
And one lucky resident
will be credited

09:33.660 --> 09:36.314
- when she publishes.
- Oh!

09:36.358 --> 09:38.665
Dr. Schmitt, you'll be scrubbing
in to assist me today.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.536
Good. Dr. Schmitt,
start your pre-op.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.581
Everyone else,
let's file out.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.412
Hi, hi,
uh, Dr. Montgomery.

09:47.456 --> 09:48.979
Are you an OB resident?

09:49.023 --> 09:50.502
Yes! Dr. Wilson.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.069
Great!
Can you get me some coffee?

09:52.113 --> 09:53.897
Black and sweet.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.294
Say it again.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.426
Rashida,
a donor kidney has been found,

10:01.470 --> 10:04.691
and it's on its way here
to Grey-Sloan for you.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.303
Did y'all hear that?

10:08.346 --> 10:10.653
Dr. Ndugu got it done.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.221
Say hi, Dr. Ndugu!

10:13.264 --> 10:15.223
Hey, followers!
Mm.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.746
Mnh-mnh.
Forget it, y'all.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.444
He's married.
Bye!

10:20.837 --> 10:22.230
Is this really happening?

10:22.273 --> 10:23.274
It's really happening.

10:23.318 --> 10:25.537
Ohh!

10:25.581 --> 10:27.844
I can't believe this.

10:27.888 --> 10:30.412
I want to thank the donor.
I want to thank their family.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.894
You can thank them by getting
well and living your best life.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.940
Who's doing the transplant?

10:36.984 --> 10:38.986
I am still
confirming that.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.118
But I'll be back soon,
alright?

10:50.998 --> 10:52.477
Hi.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.001
Oh, you're back.
Yes.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.264
Good, good. You know what?
I have so many ideas, you know?

10:56.307 --> 10:57.308
Ideas?

10:57.352 --> 10:59.528
Yeah, ideas, thoughts,
proposals.

10:59.571 --> 11:02.705
You and I are gonna update
this teaching program together.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.402
Okay. Well,
we should talk, because --

11:04.446 --> 11:06.274
Oh, and not just
grand rounds.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.929
I think we should bring in
visiting surgeons each week.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.017
And, also,
we should start

11:10.060 --> 11:11.627
video-recording
the surgeries again.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.889
I mean,
it's the best way to learn.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.630
They -- They can see
what went wrong

11:14.674 --> 11:15.936
and how the team adapted.

11:17.372 --> 11:18.678
Well, what do you think?

11:18.721 --> 11:19.722
I...

11:19.766 --> 11:21.202
It's a great idea.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.727
Come on. Come on.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.903
- Hi. Hey, Dr. Grey.
- Hi, Dr. Grey.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.731
- Welcome back, Dr. Grey.
- Missed you.

11:30.037 --> 11:31.342
Hunt.
My man.

11:31.386 --> 11:32.648
Hey.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.910
You are
a general surgeon.

11:33.954 --> 11:34.998
Mm-hmm.

11:35.042 --> 11:36.565
And you're skilled.

11:36.608 --> 11:37.914
And you might be
head of trauma,

11:37.958 --> 11:39.524
but don't you ever
think to yourself like,

11:39.568 --> 11:43.006
"Man, it sure would be cool to
not <i>just</i> do trauma"?

11:43.050 --> 11:46.357
You sound like a person
who's about to ask for a favor.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.708
I need you to do
a kidney transplant.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.448
Hmm.
Yeah, I know.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.973
Webber's got grand rounds,
and -- and Grey's got a surgery.

11:53.016 --> 11:55.584
And I-I definitely
can't ask Bailey.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.151
Why not?

11:57.194 --> 11:59.849
Well, because Bailey thought
there was no way

11:59.893 --> 12:03.592
to get my patient on
the transplant list, and I...

12:03.635 --> 12:05.289
came up with a way.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.291
Would I be committing
some kind of a crime

12:07.335 --> 12:08.336
if I did this favor?

12:08.379 --> 12:09.598
No, no.
Definitely not.

12:09.641 --> 12:10.642
But I will owe you one.

12:10.686 --> 12:12.035
Okay.
Alright.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.820
Thanks.
Thank you.

12:15.256 --> 12:16.170
What do we have?

12:16.213 --> 12:17.258
16-year-old female.

12:17.301 --> 12:18.433
Hemodynamically normal.

12:18.476 --> 12:20.261
Hydrostatic
pelvic injury.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.350
Water plowed up and cut through
her entire pelvic region.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.655
What? How?

12:23.699 --> 12:25.962
She fell off a Jet Ski.
Or was blasted off.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.659
Apparently,
it's all over the Internet.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.661
No!

12:29.705 --> 12:31.011
That video was for real?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.759
Tovah, eyes on me.

12:39.802 --> 12:40.977
Okay.

12:41.021 --> 12:42.631
We have you, okay?

12:42.674 --> 12:43.806
And the uterus?

12:43.850 --> 12:45.503
It's being prepped
as we speak.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.027
I hope it works.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.898
I'm going to do
my absolute best.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.987
And remember that whatever
happens is, um...

12:51.031 --> 12:53.468
<i>B'shert.
B'shert. </i>

12:53.511 --> 12:55.035
Mm-hmm?

12:58.212 --> 13:00.083
I heard
there were sex parties.

13:00.127 --> 13:03.173
Greys, Shepherds, Yangs --
all of 'em.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.914
And they survived a plane crash
together.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.350
What does that have to do
with Dr. Montgomery?

13:06.394 --> 13:07.787
Pretty sure
she was on the plane.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.963
She wasn't.
It was the Seattle Grace Six.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.008
Or Five.
Definitely not Seven.

13:12.052 --> 13:16.056
No --Groundbreaking surgery happening
below us right now, so shut up!

13:25.935 --> 13:28.590
Grand rounds on its feet
means that

13:28.633 --> 13:30.897
<i>you will be asked questions
during surgeries. </i>

13:30.940 --> 13:33.160
<i>All of you.</i>

13:33.203 --> 13:35.031
So maybe you want to
put away the chips.

13:37.555 --> 13:38.600
You ready?

13:38.643 --> 13:40.820
Ready.
Scalpel.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.867
Why is the uterine transplant
removed

13:44.911 --> 13:46.695
after one or two healthy babies
are born?

13:50.220 --> 13:51.569
Okay, if I don't get an answer
in five seconds,

13:51.613 --> 13:53.441
I'm clearing the gallery.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.095
You want to limit

13:55.138 --> 13:56.836
the immunosuppressive drugs
on the patient.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.098
Okay, Dr. Schmitt,
is she right?

13:58.141 --> 13:59.795
She is.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.971
I swear, my 8-year-old listens
better than some of these guys.

14:02.015 --> 14:03.364
You asked me
for an OR.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.192
I didn't tell you
it wouldn't come with a price.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.108
Now,
who can tell me where

14:08.151 --> 14:09.718
<i>the uterine arteries
are branched from? </i>

14:09.761 --> 14:10.850
Ooh, ooh!

14:14.027 --> 14:15.637
Hello, Lily.
I'm Dr. Hayes.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.986
How are you feeling?

14:18.205 --> 14:19.423
Oh.
Alright.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.425
There we go.

14:21.469 --> 14:22.905
I feel like that.
Mm-hmm.

14:22.949 --> 14:23.906
Sorry.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.690
Don't be.
I'm used to it.

14:25.734 --> 14:28.215
I've developed reflexes
like a cat.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.607
I'm seeing free fluid
in the abdomen.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.218
Mm-hmm.
Pressure looks stable.

14:31.261 --> 14:33.655
Lily, we need to get you
upstairs for a CT scan.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.309
Are your parents here?

14:35.352 --> 14:36.963
Lily!

14:37.006 --> 14:38.312
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

14:38.355 --> 14:39.879
I-I didn't even realize
she slipped off the back.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.097
- Is she okay?
- Hey, are you a friend?

14:41.141 --> 14:43.230
Yeah.
I'm -- I'm -- I'm Micah.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.579
Okay.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.929
Micah, uh, we're going to
take care of her,

14:46.973 --> 14:50.759
but Lily has had
the equivalent of a fire hose

14:50.802 --> 14:52.456
blasted up
her undercarriage,

14:52.500 --> 14:53.762
so we need to get ahold of
her parents right away.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.372
I need you to call them

14:55.416 --> 14:56.896
and tell them to
- get down here right now.
- No!

14:56.939 --> 14:58.636
She hates them, like,
really hates them.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.901
And, um...they don't know
she was meeting me IRL.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.641
Understood. I still need you
to call them -- IRL.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.426
No!

15:05.469 --> 15:07.210
Lily, your parents are going to
be worried sick about you.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.603
Not if they don't know.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.431
You're 16 years old.
We have to call your parents.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.128
Am I dying?

15:12.172 --> 15:13.956
- No.
- Then I'm not calling them.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.878
What is the benefit of using

15:22.922 --> 15:25.707
a deceased donor uterus
versus a live one?

15:25.750 --> 15:27.752
<i>The larger vessels
of the cadaver </i>

15:27.796 --> 15:29.058
<i>can be used
for the anastomoses, </i>

15:29.102 --> 15:30.538
simplifying the procedure.

15:30.581 --> 15:31.452
Is he allowed to answer?

15:31.495 --> 15:33.280
No.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.238
I've never done
one of these either.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.110
<i> Good dissection here.</i>

15:37.153 --> 15:38.024
<i> Ready for the uterus.</i>

15:46.206 --> 15:47.772
Oh, come on!

15:47.816 --> 15:49.426
- Shh!
- You shush!

15:51.602 --> 15:54.910
Dr. Schmitt, can you point out
the uterine artery and vein?

16:07.270 --> 16:08.968
What the hell was that?

16:09.011 --> 16:10.970
Noah,
this is Owen Hunt again.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.536
I've left you a few messages.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.451
Can you please call me back?
Thank you.

16:17.498 --> 16:20.022
Well...crap.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.679
You heard that, too,
right?

16:24.722 --> 16:27.160
Air-conditioning system
is overworked.

16:27.203 --> 16:28.509
A bit like the rest of us,
Chief, you know?

16:28.552 --> 16:29.901
Ugh.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.037
Jet Skis.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.473
Basically just
motorcycles on water.

16:36.517 --> 16:37.997
Nothing good
ever comes out of them.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.563
Except fun.

16:39.607 --> 16:40.912
Is it just me
or are all teenagers

16:40.956 --> 16:42.392
losing their minds
right now?

16:42.436 --> 16:44.394
Teenagers don't
have minds to lose.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.135
Micah?

16:46.179 --> 16:47.310
Micah?

16:47.354 --> 16:48.572
<i>He's in the waiting room,
Lily. </i>

16:48.616 --> 16:50.052
Just try and hold still,
okay?

16:50.096 --> 16:52.011
You know, I have OCD.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.316
I don't like germs.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.144
I don't like disorder.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.451
This world is full
of both of them.

16:57.494 --> 17:00.149
I wish I could
lock my kids in the house,

17:00.193 --> 17:02.934
away from all of it.

17:02.978 --> 17:05.546
But if you lock your kids up
too tight,

17:05.589 --> 17:08.462
you run the risk of
locking up their minds.

17:08.505 --> 17:11.073
Their wildly immature,

17:11.117 --> 17:14.381
under-developed,
overly hormonal minds.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.820
You know,
we've all been through a trauma

17:18.863 --> 17:21.040
this past year and a half,

17:21.083 --> 17:22.215
but the kids --

17:22.258 --> 17:24.391
they don't even know
how to ask for help.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.175
So they blast off
on Jet Skis

17:26.219 --> 17:28.699
with "friends" they met
on the Internet.

17:30.571 --> 17:32.094
She's got free air.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.965
I suspect
her rectum is perforated.

17:34.009 --> 17:36.490
Let's book her for an ex-lap
immediately.

17:42.278 --> 17:44.106
Optimum temperature
in the OR, Schmitt?

17:44.150 --> 17:46.978
Between
68 and 75 degrees?

17:47.022 --> 17:49.285
Correct. But it's really the
surgeon's personal preference.

17:49.329 --> 17:52.549
Oh, good. Then can we prefer
that we turn it down in here?

17:52.593 --> 17:54.073
66 degrees, please.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.076
The AC is out.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.381
The whole hospital is down.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.905
I need to start
transferring surgeries.

18:00.949 --> 18:03.995
Tseng, Ortiz, Chee,
you'll help.

18:04.039 --> 18:05.388
How long will it take you
to close Tovah?

18:05.432 --> 18:06.911
I'm halfway through
a complex

18:06.955 --> 18:09.000
end-to-side vascular
anastomosis, Richard.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.176
I can handle
a little heat.

18:10.219 --> 18:11.829
The HVAC system controls

18:11.873 --> 18:13.266
the air filtration
in the hospital.

18:13.309 --> 18:14.832
You'll need to close her
as soon as possible

18:14.876 --> 18:16.138
to prevent infection.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.966
I'm not stopping
Tovah's transplant.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.185
She's been waiting
months for this.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.621
Then find a way
to double your speed.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.318
Find me a set of hands
who's experienced in

18:22.362 --> 18:25.104
microvascular anastomosis
of the abdomen.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.931
Get me Meredith Grey.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.940
Get all available staff to put
portable AC units and fans

18:35.984 --> 18:38.508
in the ICU
and close any open window.

18:38.552 --> 18:39.988
It's cooler in here
than it is out there.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.381
For now.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.034
- What's going on?
- The HVAC's out.

18:43.078 --> 18:44.645
All surgeries are canceled
or postponed.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.212
We need to divert trauma.

18:46.255 --> 18:47.822
I have a kidney transplant.
It's already en route.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.998
Tell them to call
the next person on the list.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.609
Our patient is down to her last
access point for dialysis.

18:52.653 --> 18:55.221
She's at severe risk
for bacteremia or sepsis.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.874
I just got approval
from the transplant board

18:56.918 --> 18:58.528
to list her with
medically urgent status.

18:58.572 --> 18:59.703
I'm sorry, Winston.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.009
There is a protocol

19:01.052 --> 19:03.838
for when and if
the hospital HVAC blows out.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.622
I just never thought
we'd have to use it.

19:07.668 --> 19:08.669
Woman over P.A.: <i>
Nurse Kruger to the OR.
Nurse Kruger to the OR. </i>

19:08.712 --> 19:09.844
She can't wait
for the next one.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.498
She's getting sicker
every day

19:11.541 --> 19:13.369
because I made the decision
not to put in a permanent port.

19:13.413 --> 19:14.588
Why?
It's complicated.

19:14.631 --> 19:15.893
But she needs this kidney.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.765
She needs it,
and I need her to get it.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.419
Okay.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.290
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna save your kidney.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.688
Dr. Grey.

19:27.731 --> 19:31.082
Dr. Montgomery. Congratulations.
Uterine transplant.

19:31.126 --> 19:35.130
Congratulations to you, too.
Abdominal-wall transplant.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.697
<i>Dr. Grey also assisted on</i>

19:36.740 --> 19:39.047
<i>an abdominal-wall transplant
that included the penis. </i>

19:39.090 --> 19:41.484
Yes,
I read about that one, too.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.094
<i>She won
a Catherine Fox award, </i>

19:43.138 --> 19:44.705
<i>performed several
ALPPS procedures, </i>

19:44.748 --> 19:46.141
<i>and built mini-livers
in the lab. </i>

19:46.185 --> 19:49.057
Yes, Helm, we got it.
Thank you so much.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.843
Have you prepared
the external iliac on my side?

19:52.887 --> 19:54.497
I have.
8-0 Prolene.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.024
Thank you.

20:00.068 --> 20:02.201
Okay, so,
I closed us to trauma.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.246
I diverted the rigs
to Seattle Pres.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.987
Should we let the walk-ins know
about the situation?

20:06.030 --> 20:07.858
What do you mean
"outsourced"?

20:07.902 --> 20:10.209
You manage the facilities.
Uh --

20:10.252 --> 20:12.080
Hello?

20:12.123 --> 20:15.301
Apparently, our specialized
industrial HVAC company

20:15.344 --> 20:17.216
is overwhelmed with calls
from all over the city.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.652
You canceled
my double-knee replacement?

20:18.695 --> 20:20.349
It's 87 degrees
in OR 3.

20:20.393 --> 20:22.656
Well, it was hotter in Iraq.
Honestly, this is balmy.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.005
Yes, I'm still holding.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.267
I should go
check on Scout.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.008
Oh,
I was just in the daycare.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.879
Everyone's good.
They've got a snow-cone guy.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.229
Hopped up on sugar,
but good.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.100
I'm more worried about
the babies in the NICU.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.450
Immunocompromised and unable
to regulate their temperature?

20:34.494 --> 20:36.713
Yeah, should we consider
transferring them?

20:38.106 --> 20:39.803
No ETA
for our HVAC team.

20:41.501 --> 20:42.676
I could take a look.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.808
- Where is it?
- The HVAC?

20:44.852 --> 20:45.809
I'm good
at fixing things.

20:45.853 --> 20:48.029
Oh, oh.
I-I can assist.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.857
I just installed a window unit
this morning.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.472
Wow. That's it?
Yep.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.169
You're gonna do my surgery
on a Mack Truck?

20:58.213 --> 20:59.954
It's not a truck.
Or it is,

20:59.997 --> 21:01.651
but it's also
a fully operational OR.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.523
It was designed for emergency
surgeries in the field.

21:03.566 --> 21:04.915
It's incredible.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.743
I gotta warn you guys --
it's chilly in here.

21:06.787 --> 21:07.831
Do you guys have jackets?

21:07.875 --> 21:08.963
Ooh!
Is he single?

21:09.006 --> 21:10.312
Can I post live?

21:10.356 --> 21:11.879
No and no.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.750
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey...

21:13.794 --> 21:15.012
But if
the fire chief asks,

21:15.056 --> 21:16.405
I did not drive this here.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.320
And if your wife asks,
same.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.017
Are you serious?

21:20.061 --> 21:22.977
The way I see it,
we're in a Grey-Sloan annex.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.326
Let's go.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.327
Okay.

21:29.462 --> 21:31.638
Oh, my God.

21:31.681 --> 21:32.552
<i>Shepherd.</i>

21:32.595 --> 21:34.118
Dr. Bartley, hey!

21:34.162 --> 21:37.644
I am so sorry that
I missed our call earlier.

21:37.687 --> 21:38.949
What happened?

21:38.993 --> 21:40.124
<i> I had a complication
in the OR, </i>

21:40.168 --> 21:41.735
<i>and it took longer
than I expected. </i>

21:41.778 --> 21:43.345
Your head.
You hurt?

21:43.389 --> 21:44.912
<i>Oh, no.
I'm fine. </i>

21:44.955 --> 21:46.217
<i> Just incredibly hot.
</i>

21:47.393 --> 21:50.265
Uh, historic
Seattle heat wave.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.398
Even the hospital is not
as cool as it should be.

21:52.441 --> 21:55.662
Got it. I got the MRI scans
on the latest mice group.

21:55.705 --> 21:59.187
<i>And?74% showed that the transplanted
cells are functional.</i>

21:59.230 --> 22:01.407
Oh, my God!
That's fantastic news.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.279
<i>Meh. I see it as a need for
26% improvement. </i>

22:04.323 --> 22:05.976
I want to start another group
next week.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.370
Can you get up here by then, do
some trouble-shooting with me?

22:08.414 --> 22:10.851
I would be thrilled.
Absolutely, yeah. <i>
Thanks.</i>

22:10.894 --> 22:12.853
Close your eyes.

22:12.896 --> 22:16.335
Um...
Okay.

22:16.378 --> 22:19.686
<i>You're in Lake Superior
in late fall, </i>

22:19.729 --> 22:21.165
<i>right before
it freezes over. </i>

22:21.209 --> 22:24.081
<i>No wetsuit, no sunshine.</i>

22:24.125 --> 22:26.519
<i>It's the type of cold that
makes your fingers ache </i>

22:26.562 --> 22:28.738
<i>and your eyelashes frost.</i>

22:28.782 --> 22:31.654
Your whole body chatters,
not just your teeth.

22:34.657 --> 22:37.181
Uh...are you trying to

22:37.225 --> 22:39.270
guide-meditate me
into feeling cool?

22:39.314 --> 22:40.620
Did it work?

22:40.663 --> 22:42.230
I mean,
it didn't <i>not</i> work.

22:44.058 --> 22:46.234
See you next week,
Shepherd.

22:49.455 --> 22:50.630
Doppler.

22:51.979 --> 22:54.024
So, what's next,
Dr. Grey?

22:54.068 --> 22:56.636
Uh, just finishing up
this last stitch here.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.551
No,
I meant for you.

22:58.594 --> 23:01.554
I will win the Fox award this
year for uterine transplants,

23:01.597 --> 23:03.469
but what will earn you
second place?

23:03.512 --> 23:05.601
To be honest, I could give you
a run for first

23:05.645 --> 23:08.822
if I could get my logistics and
responsibilities here sorted.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.128
Have to have
some difficult conversations.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.130
Richard.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.002
- I'm not hearing a signal.
- What do you mean?

23:15.045 --> 23:16.090
I don't hear anything
on the Doppler.

23:16.133 --> 23:17.831
Anastomosis looks perfect.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.398
Damn it. There must be a clot
in the vessel.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.530
Okay, we'll have to
reopen the anastomosis.

23:21.574 --> 23:24.098
- You just finished.
- Well, it's all for nothing if
we don't get proper blood flow.

23:24.141 --> 23:26.056
Let's re-open the anastomosis.
Now, Schmitt.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.893
This is...
not a window unit.

23:38.765 --> 23:40.506
Nope.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.290
NICU babies.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.075
Let's give it a try,
then.

23:45.119 --> 23:46.599
Yeah.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.165
Uh...

23:48.209 --> 23:50.951
Hey, I'm -- I'm -- I'm sorry
about you and Amelia.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.085
Well, I'm sorry I didn't make it
to the wedding.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.609
Oh, please.
It was impromptu.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.828
I mean, 20 years in the making,
but impromptu.

23:58.872 --> 24:01.222
Oh, my God!

24:01.265 --> 24:03.137
What is it,
like, 120 up here?

24:03.180 --> 24:05.792
You know, my body adjusted to
extreme heat in Iraq.

24:05.835 --> 24:07.663
I'm not even sweating.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.491
That sounds more like
dehydration.

24:15.192 --> 24:17.412
So, what's the plan?

24:18.718 --> 24:20.241
Still coming up
with one.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.506
How about that?

24:24.550 --> 24:26.116
Careful.
Oh.

24:28.205 --> 24:32.688
Uh, lap pads for Lily
and my face.

24:32.732 --> 24:35.212
Catheter.

24:35.256 --> 24:37.519
I take it this isn't typical
summer weather in Seattle?

24:37.563 --> 24:39.129
You didn't live here
last summer?

24:39.173 --> 24:40.653
I don't remember seasons
during the pandemic.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.874
What is it
about closing the ORs

24:44.918 --> 24:46.528
that is so difficult
to understand?

24:46.572 --> 24:47.834
This patient should have
been transferred!

24:47.877 --> 24:49.183
And I chose
not to do that.

24:49.226 --> 24:50.576
My patient, my call.

24:50.619 --> 24:52.839
You're working with bowel.
The risk of infection --

24:52.882 --> 24:54.405
Did not outweigh the need

24:54.449 --> 24:56.538
for my patient to receive
immediate surgical care.

24:56.582 --> 24:59.280
And the longer you stand there
arguing with me about it,

24:59.323 --> 25:01.282
the longer it's gonna take
to get what you want,

25:01.325 --> 25:04.459
which is no operating
in this OR.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.982
Have anything else
to say about it?

25:07.375 --> 25:08.942
Eh!

25:10.944 --> 25:12.815
Didn't think
that would work.

25:12.859 --> 25:14.730
It works on my two teenage boys
every day.

25:14.774 --> 25:16.210
3-0 Vicryl.

25:19.343 --> 25:21.084
Okay, we've got good inflow.

25:21.128 --> 25:22.564
Heparinized saline.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.914
Won't the graft die
if this doesn't work?

25:24.958 --> 25:28.352
Not if Dr. Montgomery can
dissolve or dislodge the clot.

25:30.354 --> 25:31.486
Still no flow.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.096
- We should use a Fogarty.
- Fogarty Catheter.

25:39.581 --> 25:42.105
Inflate the cuff slowly.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.586
Pull back gently.

25:48.111 --> 25:49.852
Yes!

25:49.896 --> 25:51.637
Well done, team!

25:51.680 --> 25:53.508
You okay, Schmitt?

25:53.552 --> 25:54.770
Who? Me?

25:54.814 --> 25:57.164
I actually enjoy a <i>shvitz.</i>

25:57.207 --> 25:58.339
"Sweat" in Yiddish.

25:58.382 --> 25:59.340
Yeah, I know.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.738
Feels like old times --
you manning the anesthesia.

26:05.781 --> 26:07.217
Don't get used to it.

26:07.261 --> 26:08.741
Warren, I can't thank you
enough.

26:08.784 --> 26:10.786
I'm just happy that
somebody's using this thing.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.005
Well,
why'd it get benched?

26:12.048 --> 26:13.920
There was an incident
with my, um --

26:13.963 --> 26:15.835
with a junkie
with a gun.

26:15.878 --> 26:17.227
And the department didn't love
that there was

26:17.271 --> 26:19.229
a traveling target
for drug addicts

26:19.273 --> 26:20.970
who were desperate enough
to hijack us for fentanyl.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.624
Fair, but there must be
a solution.

26:22.668 --> 26:25.627
Trust me, I pled my case,
but, you know, no dice.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.368
Now it's just a very expensive
piece of machinery

26:27.411 --> 26:29.152
that sits out back
of the firehouse,

26:29.196 --> 26:31.328
waiting for the day when someone
will let me dust it off.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.766
Hmm. Or some stubborn surgeon
asks you to borrow it.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.551
And Grey-Sloan
paid for it, alright?

26:36.595 --> 26:39.032
Grey-Sloan can decide
what to do with it.

26:39.075 --> 26:40.163
Plus, you know,
no one ever

26:40.207 --> 26:41.295
accused us of
being rule followers.

26:41.338 --> 26:43.558
Well, I generally am
a rule follower,

26:43.602 --> 26:44.994
unless the rules mean

26:45.038 --> 26:47.388
my patient can't get
the kidney she deserves.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.390
Wait, wait, wait. Is this
an illegal kidney transplant?

26:49.433 --> 26:51.392
Okay, d-does my wife know
that I'm here?

26:51.435 --> 26:52.828
No, but she's the one
who told me

26:52.872 --> 26:54.656
to fight
the broken system.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.310
By breaking the rules?

26:56.353 --> 26:58.573
- No.
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.401
Anyway, no,
I didn't steal a kidney.

27:00.444 --> 27:02.316
And even if we had,
it wouldn't matter now,

27:02.359 --> 27:04.927
because there's urine
in the Foley.

27:04.971 --> 27:06.712
Rashida now has
a functioning kidney.

27:13.414 --> 27:14.676
Come on!

27:17.723 --> 27:19.768
Damn it!

27:21.509 --> 27:25.295
Sorry.
I'm...hot...

27:25.339 --> 27:28.734
and I just wanted to...
fix something.

27:30.213 --> 27:32.389
I just wanted
to fix something!

27:33.913 --> 27:36.002
Some things are harder to fix
than others.

27:36.045 --> 27:37.394
I'm in love with her.
I'm in love with her

27:37.438 --> 27:39.788
and I don't even think
she even thinks about me.

27:39.832 --> 27:42.095
She's planning trips
without me.

27:42.138 --> 27:44.619
She's -- She thinks
I'm old-fashioned.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.881
She...

27:45.925 --> 27:46.969
I mean,
I don't even know.

27:47.013 --> 27:48.492
She thinks I'm trying
to control her

27:48.536 --> 27:50.712
because I want some --
some commitment from her?

27:50.756 --> 27:52.279
I mean, I don't get it.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.063
I-I don't get it!

27:57.197 --> 28:00.635
This is not what I wanted
for my kid.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.028
This is -- This is --
This is what I had!

28:02.071 --> 28:04.073
This is not
what I want for Scout.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.423
I've been there.

28:06.467 --> 28:09.775
For whatever it's worth,
I have been right where you are.

28:13.517 --> 28:16.651
I'm sorry.
I'm just really hot.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.741
I made people put on hats.

28:19.785 --> 28:23.223
For fun on
the hottest day of the year.

28:25.834 --> 28:29.359
Yeah,
you want to do fun today...

28:29.403 --> 28:30.752
think cool.

28:37.803 --> 28:38.847
Zander, they're coming.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.370
So, what happened?

28:40.414 --> 28:41.850
Shh, shh, shh!

28:47.029 --> 28:48.814
Did they have it out
in the OR?

28:48.857 --> 28:50.467
No, but there
was tension.

28:50.511 --> 28:51.512
There was definitely
tension.

28:51.555 --> 28:52.774
We can hear you.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.608
Stairs.
Yes!

29:02.262 --> 29:03.219
Go, go!

29:26.503 --> 29:28.941
Oh.

29:33.728 --> 29:34.990
I thought...

29:37.079 --> 29:38.559
...coming back here...

29:41.170 --> 29:42.781
...to Seattle,
to Grey-Sloan,

29:42.824 --> 29:46.132
that, uh, he'd be here,

29:46.175 --> 29:49.526
that I would be able to feel
that he was still here...

29:51.877 --> 29:53.139
...in the city
that he loved,

29:53.182 --> 29:54.270
with the people he loved,

29:54.314 --> 29:56.229
but he isn't.

29:57.883 --> 30:00.755
And it's real.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.149
He's not here.

30:03.192 --> 30:05.020
And I'm really sorry
I'm doing this in front of you,

30:05.064 --> 30:06.979
because you're the one who had
to actually go through it.

30:11.766 --> 30:12.854
Addison...

30:18.599 --> 30:20.601
...he is here.

30:20.644 --> 30:22.821
And he's in
his children.

30:22.864 --> 30:26.346
And they are very real.

30:26.389 --> 30:29.828
And I would love for you
to come and meet them.

30:37.357 --> 30:38.967
Meredith...

30:42.275 --> 30:44.712
...you've never been one
to shy away from

30:44.755 --> 30:46.975
fighting for
what you love.

30:47.019 --> 30:49.673
So if you believe in
this next big thing,

30:49.717 --> 30:50.979
fight for it.

30:54.026 --> 30:55.984
Richard will understand.

31:20.574 --> 31:22.532
Grey made her cry,

31:22.576 --> 31:24.708
and I'm here for it.

31:30.105 --> 31:32.412
- Okay, thank you.
- Mm.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.414
Congratulations.

31:34.457 --> 31:36.938
So far, so good.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.548
There's minimal output
from her drains.

31:38.592 --> 31:39.985
Doppler studies
look good.

31:40.028 --> 31:42.944
But the true success will be
when she gets pregnant

31:42.988 --> 31:46.208
and, uh, we deliver
a healthy baby.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.951
I'm sorry about
the HVAC.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.693
It wasn't designed
to be pushed that hard.

31:52.736 --> 31:55.914
The Earth wasn't designed
to push this hard.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.089
And speaking of
pushing hard,

31:57.132 --> 31:59.004
your residents are almost there,
Richard.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.397
You made it sound
catastrophic.

32:01.441 --> 32:04.183
Well, they aren't like
you and Derek back in New York.

32:04.226 --> 32:07.099
I mean, I remember you two
were machines.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.840
All this generation wants to do
is complain.

32:09.884 --> 32:12.147
They're not complaining,
Richard.

32:12.191 --> 32:14.454
They're standing up
for themselves.

32:14.497 --> 32:17.196
They're not willing to be worked
to death by a system that,

32:17.239 --> 32:19.807
frankly, should have been
considered inhumane.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.548
I think that's progress.

32:21.591 --> 32:24.594
Doctors are overworked.

32:24.638 --> 32:26.161
You know, they're getting sick.
They're retiring early.

32:26.205 --> 32:28.381
There's a reason for that.

32:28.424 --> 32:30.078
You're saying
it's our fault?

32:30.122 --> 32:31.862
I'm saying that
we can do better.

32:31.906 --> 32:33.995
I'm saying...

32:34.039 --> 32:37.564
there's always room
for improvement.

32:37.607 --> 32:40.959
And, okay, yeah...

32:41.002 --> 32:42.438
sometimes
they're a little whiny.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.181
It's really good
to see you, Addie.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.359
It's good to see you, too,
Richard.

32:59.890 --> 33:01.196
She's not gonna die,
right?

33:02.241 --> 33:04.243
No.

33:04.286 --> 33:06.419
But she's got some
pretty serious injuries

33:06.462 --> 33:07.986
and a long road
ahead of her.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.033
So I need Lily's phone,
Micah.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.948
I need to talk
to her parents.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.036
Lily says
her parents don't know her.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.124
They just want to
track her phone

33:16.168 --> 33:18.518
and control
everything she does.

33:18.561 --> 33:20.999
Okay.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.262
But, on the other hand,
if she doesn't talk to them

33:23.305 --> 33:26.178
and if she keeps secrets
from them,

33:26.221 --> 33:28.832
how are they supposed
to know her?

33:28.876 --> 33:30.182
How are they supposed to
feel safe?

33:30.225 --> 33:31.270
How are they supposed to
even breathe?

33:31.313 --> 33:32.619
She says all they do
is yell at her.

33:32.662 --> 33:34.795
'Cause it's impossible.

33:34.838 --> 33:37.102
Because you've loved them really
well all their damn lives,

33:37.145 --> 33:38.755
and then, all of a sudden,
they turn 14

33:38.799 --> 33:41.193
and they don't want to have
anything to do with you.

33:42.716 --> 33:44.283
And you can see
that they're hurting.

33:44.326 --> 33:46.763
You can see their pain
and their fear, their panic.

33:46.807 --> 33:48.330
And they used to talk to you
about everything

33:48.374 --> 33:50.680
and cling to your leg.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.378
Now they just slam doors

33:52.421 --> 33:56.077
and stare at their phones
and tune you out.

33:56.121 --> 33:58.123
And, yeah, it's --

33:58.166 --> 34:00.951
it's really hard
being a teenager.

34:00.995 --> 34:02.127
I remember it.

34:02.170 --> 34:05.130
I remember how
my father used to shout.

34:05.173 --> 34:07.828
I remember how I used to
hate him sometimes.

34:07.871 --> 34:09.699
But do you know what,
Micah?

34:09.743 --> 34:13.094
It's also really hard being
the parent of a teenager.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.531
So if Lily's parents
have been controlling,

34:15.575 --> 34:18.578
maybe they have a reason
to be scared.

34:24.323 --> 34:25.933
Alright, Micah,

34:25.976 --> 34:28.457
Lily's gonna be crapping into
a bag for the next six months,

34:28.501 --> 34:30.720
so unless you're gonna be
the one to help clean that up,

34:30.764 --> 34:32.374
I suggest
you unlock her phone.

34:38.989 --> 34:41.079
Thank you.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.343
There you are.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.997
You saved
the grand rounds surgery.

34:47.041 --> 34:49.130
The HVAC team
finally got here,

34:49.174 --> 34:52.046
and the AC is on
in the ICU and the NICU.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.093
The whole hospital
should be back soon.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.355
Thank God.

34:56.398 --> 34:58.313
Can we talk about
the residency program?

34:58.357 --> 35:00.141
Yes! Ah!

35:00.185 --> 35:02.187
And I hope I'm not
stepping on any toes,

35:02.230 --> 35:05.015
but I really think the two of us
can revamp this whole thing.

35:05.059 --> 35:08.149
Except it won't be
the two of us.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.717
You're gonna take the job
in Minnesota.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.414
Yes and no.

35:12.458 --> 35:15.591
I was offered an opportunity
that I just cannot turn down.

35:15.635 --> 35:18.377
- Well, what is it?
- It's an opportunity
that I cannot turn down.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.553
Oh, I see.

35:20.596 --> 35:23.164
It is so good that
you can't even talk about it.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.253
I'll split my time
between here and there.

35:26.559 --> 35:29.083
And I'll stay on as
chief of general surgery,

35:29.127 --> 35:30.389
but I do have to
give up the residents.

35:30.432 --> 35:32.347
It would not
be fair to them.

35:32.391 --> 35:34.175
And, quite honestly, Richard,
I think it's wrong

35:34.219 --> 35:36.221
for anyone to have that job
but you.

35:36.264 --> 35:38.875
Yeah, you're just saying that
to make me feel better.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.399
So?

35:41.748 --> 35:45.491
So I will be honored
to stay in the role.

35:45.534 --> 35:48.015
I thank you.
Uh, Meredith,
uh, eventually,

35:48.058 --> 35:50.191
you will tell me what it is,
right?

35:51.410 --> 35:53.629
Right?!

35:55.588 --> 35:58.068
Her labs look incredible.

35:58.112 --> 35:59.983
And she's got a full bag
of urine.

36:01.594 --> 36:02.812
Did --

36:02.856 --> 36:04.988
Did it work?

36:07.165 --> 36:08.427
Do I have a kidney?

36:08.470 --> 36:09.515
It did.

36:09.558 --> 36:10.864
Everything looks great,
Rashida.

36:10.907 --> 36:13.780
Ooh!
Thailand, get ready.

36:13.823 --> 36:16.217
Yeah, you deserve to celebrate.

36:16.261 --> 36:19.655
And so do you
with your doctor-wife.

36:19.699 --> 36:21.527
And somewhere cool.

36:21.570 --> 36:24.660
Well, unfortunately,
she's out of town.

36:24.704 --> 36:27.489
But I did score an invite to the
coolest place in the hospital.

36:27.533 --> 36:30.492
Um...hello.
Where?

36:33.278 --> 36:35.410
Okay, it is definitely
cooler down here.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.240
The morgue?

36:39.284 --> 36:40.937
We got invited to the morgue?
Unh-unh. No.

36:40.981 --> 36:42.417
<i>I</i> got invited.

36:42.461 --> 36:43.853
You just followed me.

36:46.465 --> 36:48.162
Hey!
Come on in!

36:48.206 --> 36:51.165
Grab a snow cone,
cool off.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.862
Wow! This is weird.

36:52.906 --> 36:54.386
But fun, right?

36:54.429 --> 36:56.083
Sure. Thanks.

36:56.126 --> 37:00.000
I delivered two babies today
in 115-degree heat.

37:00.043 --> 37:01.741
I mean,
it's not a competition,

37:01.784 --> 37:05.135
but I did help out on
a successful uterine transplant.

37:05.179 --> 37:08.356
"It's not a competition, but
I did help out on a" bleh-bleh!

37:08.400 --> 37:10.489
Residents can feel like
they're being pulled

37:10.532 --> 37:13.056
in a zillion directions.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.971
You'll get in on
the next cool thing.

37:15.015 --> 37:17.757
Are you seriously telling me
how it feels to be a resident?

37:17.800 --> 37:20.238
<i>I tell you</i> how it feels
- to be a resident.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.196
Oh, b-b-but if Dr. Montgomery
comes back

37:22.240 --> 37:23.850
to deliver
Uterine Transplant's baby,

37:23.893 --> 37:25.460
put a good word in for me
so I can get in on it?

37:25.504 --> 37:28.158
Mm.
W--

37:30.204 --> 37:32.293
Ambassador of Fun.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.121
Yeah, nice job, Altman.

37:34.164 --> 37:35.992
Creepy, but
nice.

37:36.036 --> 37:37.603
People are dying
to get in here!

37:37.646 --> 37:39.082
No.

37:39.126 --> 37:40.693
They're not.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.220
<i>For me,
the boiling point is more about </i>

37:46.264 --> 37:48.004
<i>stuff bubbling up
from the bottom. </i>

37:49.789 --> 37:52.139
Oh, my God.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.275
Oh!

38:03.759 --> 38:06.196
Oh, my God! I have been waiting
for this moment all day.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.547
I was stuck over a brain when
the stupid AC went out.

38:08.590 --> 38:10.026
- I was over a uterus.
- Oh.

38:10.070 --> 38:12.115
Oh, good.

38:12.159 --> 38:14.553
The air is back on just as
we're leaving for the day.

38:14.596 --> 38:16.468
Typical of this place.

38:16.511 --> 38:18.078
Oh!

38:18.121 --> 38:19.253
So, where do you want
to go for dinner?

38:19.297 --> 38:21.255
Your place.
Meredith invited me over.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.691
She did?
Mm-hmm.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.476
Is that weird?

38:24.519 --> 38:25.868
Why would it be weird?

38:25.912 --> 38:27.479
No reason.

38:27.522 --> 38:29.524
Though I did hear that you guys
had a threesome one time.

38:29.568 --> 38:30.743
I heard
it was a foursome.

38:30.786 --> 38:33.485
Mm.
So...

38:35.138 --> 38:38.054
<i>It's about stuff you haven't
thought about in a while. </i>

38:38.098 --> 38:39.665
<i>It's about stuff
that's been heating up </i>

38:39.708 --> 38:41.406
<i>while you weren't even
paying attention. </i>

38:42.798 --> 38:44.670
Hey. Listen,
I know you're scared.

38:44.713 --> 38:47.629
No.
Noah...

38:47.673 --> 38:49.196
Noah,
I know you're scared.

38:49.239 --> 38:50.893
I know you're in pain.

38:50.937 --> 38:52.895
But you should also know that
there are so many others

38:52.939 --> 38:55.594
just like you who are also
scared and also in pain

38:55.637 --> 38:58.248
because the military doesn't
want to take responsibility.

39:00.860 --> 39:03.428
The only way to help all of you
is to at least try to fight,

39:03.471 --> 39:05.386
because
that is what we do.

39:05.430 --> 39:10.391
We fight for what is right
for as long as we can.

39:10.435 --> 39:14.177
And I will help you, Noah,
every step of the way.

39:21.489 --> 39:22.751
<i>The question is...</i>

39:22.795 --> 39:23.970
<i>...how well
can you contain things </i>

39:24.013 --> 39:25.580
<i>before they boil over?</i>

39:29.323 --> 39:31.238
What do you need from me?

39:31.281 --> 39:33.327
I need to know everything
that you know --

39:33.371 --> 39:36.374
what the V.A. said to you,
your story, and everyone else's.

39:41.944 --> 39:43.555
Okay.

39:45.905 --> 39:49.430
<i>The thing is, even if things
don't boil over completely, </i>

39:49.474 --> 39:51.519
<i>they can still simmer.</i>

39:55.305 --> 39:56.829
We're here!

39:56.872 --> 39:58.787
Come meet somebody,
guys.

39:58.831 --> 40:00.441
Hi!

40:00.485 --> 40:02.878
Hey. So, this is
Zola and Bailey.

40:02.922 --> 40:04.576
And the youngest one
is Ellis.

40:04.619 --> 40:06.229
She's upstairs,
in a mood.

40:06.273 --> 40:07.753
She gets it from me.

40:08.928 --> 40:10.451
Hi.

40:10.495 --> 40:11.757
Hi.
Hello.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.454
Were you
Daddy's friend?

40:13.498 --> 40:15.195
I was, yes.

40:15.238 --> 40:19.242
Uh, I'm, uh, I'm Addison.

40:19.286 --> 40:22.724
But he --
he called me Addie.

40:22.768 --> 40:25.510
<i>And as long as you're careful
how you handle yourself... </i>

40:25.553 --> 40:28.121
Want some ice cream,
Addie?

40:28.164 --> 40:30.297
I would.
I would love that.

40:36.477 --> 40:38.479
Oh, wow!
Look at this.

40:41.351 --> 40:43.484
Is this rainbow sherbet?

40:43.528 --> 40:45.921
Yeah, and guess what --
rainbow everywhere, too.

40:45.965 --> 40:47.140
I mean, and a pizza.

40:47.183 --> 40:48.402
And sprinkles.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.969
- Who doesn't like sprinkles?
- I know, right?

40:50.012 --> 40:51.623
Which topping
do you like the best?

40:51.666 --> 40:53.015
Um...

40:53.059 --> 40:54.626
Mini chips.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.018
- Yeah.
- Oh!

40:56.062 --> 40:58.412
- Skittles?
- Psych.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.022
<i>...you won't get burned.</i>

41:00.066 --> 41:01.894
You guys, guess what.

41:01.937 --> 41:03.809
I'm falling more in love
with you every second.

41:03.852 --> 41:05.463
- Thank you.
- Every stinkin' second.
