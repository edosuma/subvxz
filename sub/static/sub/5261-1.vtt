FRIDAY

03:40.960 --> 03:43.150
"When a student is ready to learn
a master appear"  Can I interrupt?

05:09.920 --> 05:12.300
I have to see a doctor.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.270
Why are you doing this?

05:18.160 --> 05:20.070
What are you going to do with me?

05:25.200 --> 05:27.190
I beg you.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.985
Not pray.

05:31.528 --> 05:34.271
Did not your mother teach you that's humiliating
?

05:49.120 --> 05:51.380
Hipolito Marsilio...

05:51.750 --> 05:56.042
was the first to use
sleep deprivation in their interrogations.

05:56.050 --> 05:59.710
- Did you know?
- I beg you, please.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.270
I told you once.

06:14.280 --> 06:17.390
Do not ever pray again.

06:33.242 --> 06:35.099
Hipolito Marsilio...

06:35.100 --> 06:39.642
he was was also the inventor of Chinese water torture.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.030
I admire for various reasons.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.870
No.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.390
You can take what you want.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.990
I will fast.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.128
Do not sleep.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.750
I want a cup of tea.
You want?

09:35.700 --> 09:38.030
Do not cry.
I have nine.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.490
Alison?

10:00.671 --> 10:02.030
Look.

10:14.328 --> 10:15.700
You're mine now.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.390
Not chamomile,
but is very good.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.728
Who knows...

11:08.640 --> 11:10.750
when you can fight...

11:13.840 --> 11:16.140
and when you can not...

11:17.320 --> 11:19.070
we will be victorious.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.230
Are you...?

11:24.680 --> 11:27.430
You know that phrase?

11:29.400 --> 11:30.957
It must be so.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.310
Perfectly expresses our unity.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.270
You can not fight.

11:50.920 --> 11:54.150
You need only chance of survival...

12:00.720 --> 12:02.750
it is if you give up.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.260
Give me what I want.

12:09.928 --> 12:12.442
And you and your husband will be free.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.957
What do you want?

12:22.640 --> 12:24.390
I want you to want me.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.180
As a loving wife...

12:30.385 --> 12:32.042
wants her man.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.790
No, but...

13:42.920 --> 13:44.870
naughty girl.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.790
Very naughty girl.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.870
Enter.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.110
- Happy?
- Crazy bastard.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.099
Burning far too hot.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.580
Please close the key.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.500
DesnÃºdate.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.190
And hurry.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.630
Off the water.
Please.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.585
Also that.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.430
Must be clean,
also take it off.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.670
What is this?
Do you recognize this?

15:47.760 --> 15:49.270
Come join this group.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.830
Carefully.

15:56.160 --> 16:00.070
- What do we say?
- Thank you.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.642
Welcome.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.510
I can not hear you rub.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.790
Tom, I'm going back as soon as possible
alarm.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.310
Will you help me?

16:30.480 --> 16:35.110
Not touch him.
- Even wash the blood.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.870
Away from her.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.710
Damn bastard.
Get away from her.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.580
Why are you doing this?

17:02.600 --> 17:03.950
Why not?

17:06.040 --> 17:07.180
Why not?

17:11.359 --> 17:13.660
Why you break up with us?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.510
Why us?

17:17.720 --> 17:19.950
Because you asked me.

17:27.760 --> 17:32.070
Try to sleep.
I have a weekend to you.

17:33.880 --> 17:37.990
Saturdays and Sundays
am the perfect husband...

17:38.160 --> 17:42.470
and you the perfect wife.
It will be a perfect weekend.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.390
Going to rape me, is not it?

17:49.040 --> 17:50.950
Why you just do it?

17:51.880 --> 17:53.710
Sleep now.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.670
We will have time for these questions later.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.870
SATURDAY

18:09.400 --> 18:11.630
Time to wake his wife.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.190
You do not have to do that.

18:49.814 --> 18:52.350
- I'm not leaving.
- I know.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.670
Not without Tom.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.030
That dedication makes you flexible.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.510
A useful feature for someone like me.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.728
No one else but you and me.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.720
Just us.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.300
This will be a very special weekend
.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.230
Do not you feel?

20:03.560 --> 20:05.630
Can I wear a robe
please?

20:09.480 --> 20:11.470
Course.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.830
I do not want you to be cold.

20:45.920 --> 20:49.270
What you got there?
Turn around. Ali.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.550
It will look much better on me
do not you think?

21:23.160 --> 21:24.830
Help me.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.470
Nice shirt, by the way.

21:40.680 --> 21:42.390
Did you choose?

21:50.680 --> 21:52.230
More adjusted.

21:54.600 --> 21:55.990
More adjusted.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.430
More adjusted.

22:02.720 --> 22:03.780
Do it.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.871
Come on.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.328
Do it.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.110
Ready?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.271
How do I look?

22:25.920 --> 22:27.310
Ali?

22:28.360 --> 22:31.110
- Do not call me.
- Why not?

22:33.560 --> 22:35.550
Only Tom tells me so.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.910
I'll do whatever you want.
Please.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.230
Have eight.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.128
Make sure you do not lose more.

23:52.480 --> 23:55.110
Cooking is not your strong point.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.150
Is of Tom?

23:59.520 --> 24:06.150
Or still you think a woman
belongs only to the kitchen or bed?

24:14.320 --> 24:16.110
Your husband must be hungry.

24:17.200 --> 24:22.470
Mira. If you are is sweet,
let you feed.

24:24.640 --> 24:28.340
You need to relax.

24:29.520 --> 24:34.670
The weekend will be much easier if you just accept
.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.630
If you hold me.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.230
Where is my phone?

25:24.600 --> 25:28.979
Pick up the phone,
tell them to call the police.

25:28.980 --> 25:30.980
Please call the police.

25:38.120 --> 25:42.100
Normally what you do in a
day like this, with your husband?

25:42.640 --> 25:44.310
Nothing special.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.790
- You choose.
- Really?

25:50.080 --> 25:51.710
Do you trust me?

25:56.920 --> 25:59.070
Do you trust your husband?

26:00.840 --> 26:02.590
Whatever he decides?

26:05.240 --> 26:09.830
And you trust me,
as you trust your husband?

26:12.200 --> 26:13.910
I trust you.

26:25.240 --> 26:30.430
12, 13, 14, 15...

26:34.680 --> 26:36.310
What is happening?

26:48.080 --> 26:49.830
What is happening?

26:54.640 --> 26:59.230
That's our song.
What went down?

27:02.160 --> 27:05.585
What a happy married couple
do in your spare time.

27:06.520 --> 27:11.230
Ali, what made you...
Did you touch my wife?

27:12.360 --> 27:16.190
- Continues.
- I asked you a question.

27:16.360 --> 27:20.750
Nothing happened.
Quiet, nothing happened.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.442
Yet.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.030
What are you waiting for?

27:37.200 --> 27:38.550
Key.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.590
Can you close it?

27:43.160 --> 27:45.870
If I do something for you
you do something for me?

27:46.960 --> 27:50.150
No.... Do not you dare say that.

27:51.360 --> 27:55.179
- Very good.
- Do not do anything for me.

27:55.180 --> 27:57.300
Do not do it for me.
Do not let it. Ali.

27:57.757 --> 28:01.520
Do not.
I beg damn.

28:01.700 --> 28:05.241
Do not give in. Do not go pee for him.

28:05.242 --> 28:07.719
Do not.
's A fucking psychopath.

28:07.720 --> 28:12.510
Do not do anything for us.
He is a...

28:12.680 --> 28:17.430
you're ruining the moment.
You scream like a stupid pig.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.950
Now I'll treat you like a pig.

28:21.120 --> 28:24.550
Fuck!
Fuck!

28:45.280 --> 28:46.830
Have a loving home.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.950
Perfect.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.728
Tom likes an orderly home.

28:55.640 --> 28:59.590
A love Tom, Tom
succeeds.

29:04.080 --> 29:09.270
You cook, you do the toilet.
're Very traditional.

29:16.120 --> 29:21.510
Then I guess Tom is the breadwinner.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.470
Where do you work?

29:30.000 --> 29:31.470
He is a writer.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.242
Technical Editor.

29:37.585 --> 29:40.442
Business is good.
Now you have an assistant.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.950
Good for Tom.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.350
Computer for Tom.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.390
Computer  for the wizard.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.790
But you want more.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.950
- A little.
- I see.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.230
What happened there?

30:27.040 --> 30:31.750
DEAR DAUGHTER EMILY

30:35.120 --> 30:36.790
Can we ignore that?

30:43.200 --> 30:44.710
Later, perhaps.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.270
- Please.
- Please what?

31:00.520 --> 31:04.350
- Do not make me wear this.
- Do not you want to put?

31:05.880 --> 31:07.585
Why did you buy it?

31:10.480 --> 31:11.830
I did not buy it.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.830
My husband bought it.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.030
Your husband wanted to see that.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.590
And now too.

31:30.920 --> 31:34.950
Well, well, well.

31:35.120 --> 31:38.510
Hermosa.
Go Go.

31:38.680 --> 31:40.790
Perfect.
Look at me.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.430
Perfect.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.420
I want to see your face.

32:04.640 --> 32:08.260
Okay.
Stand up, please.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.700
Good.
Beautiful.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.670
Wait.

32:15.880 --> 32:18.590
Can not you be more stylish?

32:19.960 --> 32:21.590
Can you?

32:21.760 --> 32:23.790
Okay.

32:24.760 --> 32:29.620
Okay.
Slow down.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.390
Slow down.

32:32.440 --> 32:35.270
Yes, very beautiful.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.900
Good, good.

32:38.080 --> 32:43.670
Well, lovely.
Now turn around.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.750
Slow down.
Turn around.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.590
Turn around.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.390
I said:
Turn around.

32:57.080 --> 33:00.590
Turn around.

33:00.760 --> 33:04.110
Great.
No smile?

33:05.240 --> 33:07.540
Thanks.
That beautiful.

33:15.800 --> 33:20.310
Grab the phone, is
backpack. Come on, Ali.

33:22.040 --> 33:24.270
Grab the phone.

33:27.320 --> 33:28.910
Come on, Ali.

33:36.560 --> 33:39.230
- What's the code?
- It's 1605.

33:39.400 --> 33:42.390
Hurry call the police.

33:50.520 --> 33:54.270
- I want you to go.
- Attack him. Come on.

33:54.440 --> 33:58.990
- What do you expect? Attack him.
- Get out of my house!

33:59.160 --> 34:04.470
Attack him. Let's do it.
Let entiÃ©rraselo.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.940
Do it.
You want to attack me?

34:11.120 --> 34:12.989
Leave her alone.

34:16.400 --> 34:20.020
You felt you could.
Now I will punish you.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.110
Open your mouth.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.190
Swallow it.

36:03.440 --> 36:06.150
Suck it up, suck it up.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.150
Do not tell me:
"No".

36:26.500 --> 36:28.271
Did you know that...?

36:29.014 --> 36:31.534
The physiological response in human sexual contact
...

36:34.680 --> 36:36.350
is involuntarily?

36:43.280 --> 36:45.710
It is very possible...

36:47.160 --> 36:49.990
that even though you say no...

36:52.160 --> 36:55.310
unconsciously body says yes.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.310
Is why many men abused...

37:02.360 --> 37:05.528
of that old nonsense.

37:06.900 --> 37:08.842
They really wanted...

37:08.920 --> 37:10.710
an excuse.

37:12.000 --> 37:17.070
Many people are too primitive to understand the simple
physiology.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.870
What is very interesting...

37:25.360 --> 37:29.510
Is it possible for a victim
men get an erection...?

37:30.480 --> 37:33.710
Or a woman have an orgasm...

37:36.040 --> 37:37.990
during an assault?

37:51.560 --> 37:53.642
It's not enough for me to have you.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.870
I want you to want me.

38:05.320 --> 38:06.830
That will happen.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.190
Before this week
finally finished.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.550
And if not...

38:17.160 --> 38:19.150
or if you try to escape again...

38:21.160 --> 38:24.614
you'll anyway.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.990
Understand?

38:31.200 --> 38:32.790
Open your mouth.

38:34.400 --> 38:37.430
Bigger.
Your tongue.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.242
Good.

38:42.614 --> 38:44.214
Good.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.071
Good girl.

39:04.120 --> 39:07.590
Your
taste is much sweeter when you're afraid.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.750
SARAH Single? XXXX

40:44.520 --> 40:47.230
- I NEED XX
- I XX

41:01.960 --> 41:07.350
- Come on, let's play the nurse.
- Later, Emily wake.

41:10.520 --> 41:14.430
Is always that stupid.

41:15.680 --> 41:19.190
- You do not...
- Well done.

41:19.360 --> 41:24.220
Stupid girl.
Back here right now!

41:24.400 --> 41:29.340
- Every fight is so stupid...
- Do not mourn Emily. Please.

41:33.300 --> 41:34.990
Shut up.

41:35.160 --> 41:38.310
Please.
I will play the nurse.

41:40.280 --> 41:44.230
- I will.
- Shut the hell up.

42:14.040 --> 42:16.340
I never had the privilege.

42:23.920 --> 42:26.110
I have not met anyone special.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.310
Explain this.

43:05.480 --> 43:06.910
Do you love her?

43:10.160 --> 43:11.510
Alison?

43:12.640 --> 43:15.710
Your wife?
You love her?

43:16.920 --> 43:18.590
You hit it, right?

43:19.640 --> 43:21.510
No.
- You do not know what love is.

43:21.680 --> 43:23.750
No...

43:27.400 --> 43:29.419
You treat her like a piece of meat.

43:29.420 --> 43:31.420
- No...
- Yes

43:35.120 --> 43:39.750
Why do you love her.?
What do you like about it?

43:41.720 --> 43:44.990
Why are you with her?
What she has...

43:46.080 --> 43:47.814
I told you about?

43:48.680 --> 43:54.780
I'll love Alison
like nobody's loved.

43:58.760 --> 44:00.671
Have you made love to this woman
?

44:05.585 --> 44:06.957
What?

44:12.320 --> 44:13.870
Bad answer.

44:55.160 --> 44:56.830
Change your clothes.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.750
What do you want me to wear?

45:14.600 --> 45:16.670
What you want to sleep.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.750
I have to go to the bathroom.

45:27.160 --> 45:31.110
This is blocked.
I'll fix it in the morning.

45:37.120 --> 45:39.910
SUNDAY

46:21.757 --> 46:26.670
My God, Tom.
What have you done now?

46:42.120 --> 46:45.350
- Where is he?
- I'm going to save us.

46:45.520 --> 46:48.557
You can not.

46:48.842 --> 46:51.185
You can not, Ali.

46:51.800 --> 46:56.550
He wants me at any time.
I have to make him believe that.

47:00.040 --> 47:07.700
- Have you been in bed with him?
- No, not yet so far.

47:07.757 --> 47:10.980
Not yet? Ali,
can not sleep with him.

47:11.160 --> 47:15.180
- He'll be back.
- I do not want them to.

47:15.185 --> 47:20.350
- Trust me. I can do it.
- No, do not.

47:20.520 --> 47:25.430
Silence. If we listen, we will kill
.

47:32.520 --> 47:34.150
I love you.

47:52.640 --> 47:56.550
Good morning, honey.
Breakfast in bed?

48:05.760 --> 48:08.190
- Thanks.
- You are welcome.

48:22.200 --> 48:23.471
Come.

48:39.471 --> 48:41.300
He will have.
That should be enough.

49:10.840 --> 49:12.390
Want some coffee?

49:29.071 --> 49:30.614
What happened to your daughter?

49:33.720 --> 49:35.590
The lost sight.

49:37.880 --> 49:41.310
Just for a moment.
That I lost.

49:43.280 --> 49:44.790
Where was Tom?

49:46.800 --> 49:48.270
In a business trip.

49:49.720 --> 49:51.757
Could not get on the day.

49:53.760 --> 49:55.110
Was it a car?

49:59.000 --> 50:00.630
A motorcycle.

50:04.480 --> 50:05.830
Sorry.

50:07.120 --> 50:09.310
She got quick feet.

50:14.920 --> 50:20.070
A few days the doctors thought she would survive.

50:24.400 --> 50:27.990
They said he was a fighter.

50:29.840 --> 50:34.550
I spent five days in bed
while working with it.

50:36.480 --> 50:39.242
Thrusting tubes and needles.

50:41.320 --> 50:46.790
I could not even hold her when she left.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.990
She's in a better place.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.030
I can not believe it.

51:03.160 --> 51:05.310
I can not believe in a God...

51:06.360 --> 51:09.470
that takes away a child to his mother.

51:09.640 --> 51:12.200
I would rather be her.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.614
O Tom.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.950
He has not come to visit.

51:22.800 --> 51:26.950
He said he could support her in that state.

51:29.880 --> 51:31.270
What about me?

51:33.200 --> 51:35.190
What about supporting his wife?

51:38.000 --> 51:41.350
I suffered and he did not notice.

51:42.720 --> 51:44.270
She never noticed.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.590
Was it what you wanted to hear?

52:02.120 --> 52:03.870
Almost forgot.

52:05.440 --> 52:07.470
You could hurt you.

52:12.720 --> 52:14.870
Should coffee?

52:22.400 --> 52:26.100
- What would you like to do today?
- I do not care.

52:27.680 --> 52:29.430
I have an idea.

53:16.640 --> 53:19.070
I noticed you fixed the mirror.

53:20.160 --> 53:21.550
Thanks.

53:24.840 --> 53:26.830
"Open the panel as they say."

54:04.840 --> 54:08.070
Where is my wife?
What did you do with Ali?

54:14.320 --> 54:17.790
- What have you done with my wife?
- You're good right?

54:19.600 --> 54:21.070
Give it time.

54:48.680 --> 54:50.430
You must be tired.

54:52.480 --> 54:54.710
How about a foot massage?

55:42.960 --> 55:44.510
Okay.

57:13.360 --> 57:16.110
- I'm cooking.
- What are you doing?

57:16.280 --> 57:21.590
I had to limit myself to what I had at home.

57:21.760 --> 57:23.985
I had this in mind.

57:24.760 --> 57:27.190
Do you have white wine vinegar?

57:29.000 --> 57:30.470
No.

57:31.760 --> 57:34.990
- Where did you learn to cook?
- Of my father.

57:59.520 --> 58:01.190
Board sex?

58:03.320 --> 58:11.185
This is nasty shit,
cheap stuff. You deserve something better.

58:12.840 --> 58:15.242
It is why I believe in the Japanese.

58:16.160 --> 58:19.830
They even raise slavery to art.

58:21.440 --> 58:25.470
Can you imagine another culture that
those beautiful buttons do you use?

58:27.000 --> 58:29.110
It is a beautiful culture.

58:31.600 --> 58:35.710
In ancient Japan, the neck was
an erogenous zone.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.270
There are few men who really appreciate the female form
.

58:42.440 --> 58:46.550
The lower back, knees.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.270
Collarbone.

58:50.720 --> 58:53.790
Much more sexy that shit there.

58:55.960 --> 58:58.328
Why I did for you yesterday?

58:59.240 --> 59:05.030
Well, yesterday
wanted to look like your husband.

59:05.200 --> 59:08.980
Today I want to be the man you deserve.

59:14.520 --> 59:16.270
What do you want me to wear?

59:17.360 --> 59:21.270
The lady choose.
Anyway you are overwhelming.

59:37.480 --> 59:39.270
Like?

59:44.800 --> 59:46.385
Does your husband likes?

59:47.928 --> 59:49.528
See what my husband likes.

59:51.200 --> 59:53.030
I designed it myself.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.590
I design underwear for an expensive brand.

59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.070
- Nothing special.
- On the contrary.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:08.070
You make women feel beautiful and you turn
desire...

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.310
in men.
You are very special.

01:00:21.242 --> 01:00:22.614
Do...?

01:00:24.328 --> 01:00:25.471
A Tom...

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.350
likes your design?

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.900
He does not want you to remember my work.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.510
My father always did this.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.980
- Should serve?
- As you like.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.430
How do you like your steak?
I like to "Bleu".

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.990
Elbows.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.150
Toast.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.310
By divine company.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.790
Eating and drinking do not go well together.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.230
Dance with me.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.910
- I can not dance.
- Everybody can dance.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.700
I do not dance.
Tom says I have two left feet.

01:03:17.871 --> 01:03:21.190
Really?
What he knows now?

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.230
Put your arms around my neck.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.230
Please.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.860
I love your eyes.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.310
Really?

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:47.928
You are a gift to the wrong man.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.300
Why do you want?
He treats you like meat.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.550
- He can be very friendly.
- When?

01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:01.310
- If he hits you almost to death?
- I want to talk about Tom.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.020
You must kill him, you know?
Otherwise he will kill you.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.980
- What's your name?
- My name is not important.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.390
It is to me.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.590
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I cleanse you.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:43.780
- I'll get something to clean it.
- Salt is best for red wine.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.630
- We think alike.
- In fact it is.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.550
Let me help.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:16.550
These are times when a family shares.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.630
If necessary,
buy a new carpet.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.630
Yes we can.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.590
I think you mean something.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.830
How do you know my name?

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:48.070
We met before.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.950
Yes?

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.950
Where?

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.790
Was more than once.

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.390
We speak.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.430
We had a conversation.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.150
I do not know...

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.070
Where?

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.990
That's not important.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.830
You said you were attracted to me.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.550
I saw it in his eyes.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.470
I needed.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.910
Just as you needed.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.390
Am I going to wake up tomorrow?

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.630
Only you can decide that.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:01.230
MONDAY

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:24.140
THANK YOU FOR A LOVELY WEEK END
. AARON

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:03.910
I am.

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:09.429
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:11.359
What?

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:14.029
- It is gone.
- QuÃ­tame this.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:15.760
Come on.

01:09:15.761 --> 01:09:17.760
I do it as fast as I can.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.702
I seek
the phone and call the police.

01:09:20.727 --> 01:09:22.573
Ali, take away these ropes.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:25.510
- Call the police later.
- They are not mobile.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:26.859
I'm going to release you.

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:28.859
How did you get the knife?
Where is the?

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.149
- How do you get the knife?
- Shut up and relax.

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:40.029
Quiet.

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:51.908
- Take it away. .
- Yes

01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:53.910
Please.
Dammit.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.190
- I'll help you.
- Dammit.

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:04.719
Help me out.
Bring me some bandages.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.471
What do you want?
Exit or bands?

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.630
Bring me a bandage.
Please.

01:10:53.871 --> 01:10:56.590
- Shit.
- I am so sorry.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.510
Why did you make?

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.470
- I'll take care of you.
- Since when?

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.830
I'm tied in the bathroom
and you're ready for it?

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.380
Why?

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:35.014
He just wanted a good meal
company?

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:43.150
Look at you now.
The cheap whore you are.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.070
Go with it!
Does he really fucked you?

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:49.350
What are you doing?
Stop.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:53.850
I had to pretend it was his fucking wife...

01:11:53.985 --> 01:11:56.630
not to rape me or kill us
.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.790
Sorry.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.270
Come here.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:05.470
All is well. Sorry

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.030
All is well

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.830
"
Thanks for a wonderful weekend."

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.230
Aaron.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.414
"Whatever happens,
give me the blame."

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:46.150
- Aaron.
- Do not do that, Tom.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:51.670
Relax, lie down and rest.
I'll find a phone and ask for help.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.310
Did you have sex?

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:04.950
- No. I did not.
- Do not?

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:08.030
He had a wonderful weekend.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.710
- I thought I could trust you.
- You can trust me.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.385
He slept in my bed.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.510
- Did you have sex?
- No...

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.430
Was it good?

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.470
Did you to come?
Did he have a big dick?

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.580
Did he take you? Do you mojaste?
That's enough for me, right?

01:13:49.185 --> 01:13:52.230
Me not you were running but he did.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.270
Me not you were running, do you Ali?

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.910
I do not even look
since Emily died.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.460
Back here.
I will clean your fucking mess.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.550
What are you doing?
Stop.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:21.780
's Dead, Alison.
Why I can not use my office?

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.550
Wait.
Why are you doing this?

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.950
Basta.
Stop.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.910
Survive just a weekend horrible.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.350
I survived this bloody weekend

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.830
You've had a wonderful weekend with your partner
shit.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.470
Why did you do it?

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.590
Why you fucked?
Do you want another baby?

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.950
I wanted to be pregnant again?
Do you want another baby?

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:03.430
You want a sperm donor?

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.160
Stupid whore.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.550
Slut.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.270
I'm not done with you.
Back.

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.310
Where are you going?

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:38.990
To love, honor and obey.
You know those votes yet?

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.550
Do you remember?
That promised me.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.180
You had promised not fuck with another man.

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:06.190
Photos were taken with my camera?

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.071
Did you like the catsuit?
That you did for me.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.420
Why was it so special?

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.380
Also they recorded video?

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:30.870
- It was not that.
- Dirty bitch. You're lying.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.550
I'm sorry. Affection.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:45.300
I'm sorry.
Look at me.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:52.580
That was not me.
I love you. Listen me.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.630
I'm sorry.
I love you.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.910
Seriously. That was not me, was not me.
Look what I did.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:08.550
- I love you.
- It is not true.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:12.950
So I'm not.
Look what I did.

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:16.870
I cut fingers.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:21.310
I did not want to hurt you.
I'm sorry.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:37.270
- Why do you hate me?
- I'll call an ambulance.

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:44.030
- Why do you hate me so much?
- Need help.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.350
I do not need.
Everything is fine.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:53.071
I love you.

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:57.310
All is well.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.270
I have to call an ambulance...

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.150
Basta.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:13.950
Ali, I just want to be with you.
I want to feel. I am so sorry.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.590
Basta.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.470
Stupid bitch.
I'll kill you.

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.710
I'll kill you.

01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:07.870
KNOW YOUR CHILD

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.950
LIAR

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:38.500
We are fixing the house.
Do not come today, Sarah.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:43.185
- Is the blood of Tom?
- You do not have to do this.

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:47.070
- What have you done?
- He hurt you.

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.700
- No, I know.
- How do I know?

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.720
My best friend fucking my husband.

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.790
This is your fault.
You're always working.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:02.470
- Heaven. Tom. Is dead?
- I hope so.

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:06.230
Do not say that.
Why do not you call an ambulance?

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.390
Tom had other plans.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.814
If it survives, can have it.

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:16.710
- What happened to you?
- I woke up.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.030
- What are you doing here?
- Emergency Service.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:44.609
Out of my house!
All are the same.

01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:51.950
All you want to fuck me like a stupid life...

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:04.230
are equal.
I will not let that happen. You asked for it.

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:08.180
I'll kill you fucking whore once.

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:12.670
Stupid whore.

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:26.030
What makes you think I have the right to fuck
my life?

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:29.230
- Basta.
- What will you do about it?

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:49.950
We'll go to jail.
I removed my baby.

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.157
We'll be fine.

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.120
A man kidnapped us this weekend.

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.470
He killed my husband.

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.510
What man?

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.830
Just a moment.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:22.830
Okay.
Take your time.

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.580
Hello.
How may I help?

01:23:27.985 --> 01:23:31.380
I want a duplicate of the key.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:36.710
- Would you like to wait or come back later?
- No, I think back.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:40.830
- So I do some shopping.
- No problem.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.528
Can you give me your name and address?

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:18.385
- We'll be ready in an hour.
- Okay. Thank you.
