00:01.400 --> 00:05.166
Previously on Elementary...
I have a daughter, Chivonne.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.067
When I was in Great Meadow
I wrote letters,

00:08.100 --> 00:09.636
birthday cards,
that sort of thing.

00:09.670 --> 00:12.468
And then my letters to Chivonne
started coming back unopened.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.330
I know he's a criminal.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.404
He was a criminal.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.271
And now he's
Just cured?

00:17.310 --> 00:19.244
He's ready to be
a father to Chivonne?

00:20.250 --> 00:21.376
Look, before you talk
to her, I think...

00:21.420 --> 00:24.218
I'm not going to talk to her.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.787
I want her in my life,
I have to earn it.

00:27.790 --> 00:29.758
*

00:29.790 --> 00:32.156
* And everyone else I know...

00:32.200 --> 00:34.350
Here you go.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.265
You can relax now.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.667
I promise no one followed you
and no one's watching you.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.407
I guess this whole undercover
thing got me on edge.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.499
Well, I can't imagine why.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.371
So how are things going
with Detective Guzman?

00:46.410 --> 00:47.707
Good, I think.

00:47.740 --> 00:50.846
He says I'm giving him
some good stuff.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.246
Did he give you an ETA on when
you're gonna move on the gang?

00:53.280 --> 00:54.417
Above my pay grade.

00:54.450 --> 00:57.180
Guzman says when it's time,

00:57.220 --> 00:59.586
I'll be the first to know.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.686
I got a text from my
daughter last night.

01:04.730 --> 01:05.754
Chivonne?

01:05.790 --> 01:07.826
I guess her auntie

01:07.860 --> 01:09.669
finally told her I was out.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.168
She wants to see me.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.698
What'd you tell her?

01:16.240 --> 01:17.639
I told her yes.

01:19.610 --> 01:21.828
Okay, Doc, you can say it.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.108
Look, I know that
she's the reason

01:25.150 --> 01:26.572
why you're doing this,

01:26.620 --> 01:28.611
that you want to be someone
that she can look up to.

01:28.650 --> 01:30.208
But seeing her right now

01:30.250 --> 01:32.218
could be really dangerous
for both of you.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.854
I know, but she asked to see me.

01:34.890 --> 01:37.882
After all this time,
she came to me.

01:37.930 --> 01:41.320
If I turn her down,
I might not get a second chance.

01:44.830 --> 01:46.229
Just be careful.

01:46.270 --> 01:49.501
Always.

01:49.540 --> 01:54.409
Hello, ol, and th, wasseo,
gamers and gamerettes.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.671
It's O.G. Pwnzr coming to you
live from New York City

01:57.710 --> 02:01.578
with your daily dose of...
(imitates explosion) knowledge.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.838
Today I'm gonna introduce you
to the newest champion

02:03.890 --> 02:07.314
for Skystrike Titans,
Vadrus Typhon.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.180
He is a complete badass,

02:09.230 --> 02:12.358
which is why all you rug rats
are gonna pay big bucks

02:12.400 --> 02:14.755
for this upgrade,
so you can do this...

02:14.800 --> 02:16.358
(laughs)

02:16.400 --> 02:19.631
"But how do I execute
that combo?" you ask...

02:19.670 --> 02:21.763
Okay, admit it,
this guy's hilarious.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.462
He's old. He's got to be,
like, 30.

02:24.510 --> 02:26.205
Yeah, but, like,
that's the whole point.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.470
He's been playing forever,
so he knows all the tricks.

02:28.510 --> 02:30.239
He's gonna be at the VGU Open
this weekend.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.215
I'm gonna play him.
I'm gonna kick his ass.

02:33.250 --> 02:35.309
I can't believe you're wasting
an entire weekend

02:35.350 --> 02:36.612
playing video games

02:36.650 --> 02:38.481
with sweaty nerdcore dweebs.

02:38.520 --> 02:39.885
Not all of them are dweebs.

02:39.920 --> 02:43.356
Challenge Uncle O.G.,
but be warned--

02:43.390 --> 02:45.255
you will be wrecked.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.224
There will be pwnage.

02:47.260 --> 02:50.263
Okay, kids,
don't try this at home.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.632
(grunts)

02:52.670 --> 02:55.195
What the hell?
Was that real?

02:55.240 --> 02:57.367
Wait, did somebody hit him?

02:57.410 --> 02:58.729
(phone rings)

02:58.770 --> 03:00.772
Yes, ma'am, we'll...
we'll look into it.

03:00.810 --> 03:03.301
Thanks.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.306
Hey, Marcus, my
niece just called.

03:05.350 --> 03:08.274
She was watching some
live video online,

03:08.320 --> 03:10.208
and she thinks she saw
this guy get assaulted.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.717
She's worried he
might be dead.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.548
A guy who uses
the name "O.G. Pwnzr"?

03:14.590 --> 03:16.421
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.

03:16.460 --> 03:17.552
She's not the only one.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.399
911's ringing off the hook.

03:19.430 --> 03:22.297
Apparently he was some sort
of online celebrity.

03:22.330 --> 03:24.628
Whatever happened,
it went viral.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.194
Look at the number
of Viewers.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.762
30,000 people
have seen this?

03:30.810 --> 03:33.404
Only no one knows
the guy's real name

03:33.440 --> 03:34.873
or where he was in New York
when this happened.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.775
If he's dead, there's
a murder scene out there,

03:36.810 --> 03:38.300
and no way to find it.

03:38.350 --> 03:40.341
(grunting)

03:43.950 --> 03:44.939
*

04:19.020 --> 04:21.318
Hey.
Hey. No Sherlock?

04:21.360 --> 04:22.850
He wasn't there when
I woke up this morning.

04:22.890 --> 04:24.858
I texted him, but
I haven't heard back.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.858
So do we know any more
about the victim?

04:26.900 --> 04:29.460
This is just what we were
able to dig up online.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.661
Still don't know where
the attack took place,

04:31.700 --> 04:32.997
or if he's alive or dead.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.565
We do know that "O.G."
is a pseudonym,

04:35.600 --> 04:38.068
and that he's good at keeping
his real name private.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.873
The company that hosts
his live stream

04:39.910 --> 04:41.832
does all their business
with him through a DBA,

04:41.880 --> 04:45.304
so we subpoenaed the IRS
to pull ownership records,

04:45.350 --> 04:46.749
but they're taking
their time, as usual.

04:46.780 --> 04:48.577
Mm. Are you sure
he was in New York?

04:48.620 --> 04:51.487
He said he was. He was supposed
to appear at a tournament

04:51.520 --> 04:53.351
this weekend
at the Javits Center.

04:53.390 --> 04:54.709
If you want the latest,
you should join the captain.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.988
He's about to get a briefing.

04:56.020 --> 04:57.453
From who,
the computer crime squad?

04:57.490 --> 04:59.594
His niece.

04:59.630 --> 05:01.621
He live-streams pretty
much every day.

05:01.660 --> 05:03.764
I mean, he covers a bunch
of different games,

05:03.800 --> 05:06.360
but I mostly watch
the Skystrike Titans ones.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.664
And he makes a living at this?

05:08.700 --> 05:10.702
Well, people donate money
if they like the stream.

05:10.740 --> 05:11.900
Plus, he has sponsors.

05:11.940 --> 05:13.669
He says he makes
even more doing this

05:13.710 --> 05:15.439
than he did when
he was a pro gamer.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.846
A professional
video game player.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.041
It's a big thing,
though, Uncle Tommy.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.719
I mean, these games make,
like, billions of dollars.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.048
There are hundreds of millions
of players all over the world.

05:25.090 --> 05:26.682
There are
corporate-sponsored teams,

05:26.720 --> 05:28.711
tournaments with
million-dollar prizes.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.057
They call it
"eSports," right?

05:30.090 --> 05:33.389
O.G. was a pro--
one of the first.

05:33.430 --> 05:36.058
But it's hard for older players
to stay on top.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.522
You know, their
reflexes slow down,

05:37.570 --> 05:38.821
they get this thing
with their thumbs

05:38.870 --> 05:40.667
where it locks from doing
the same motion

05:40.700 --> 05:41.689
over and over and over.

05:41.740 --> 05:43.662
Stenosing tenosynovitis.

05:43.710 --> 05:44.938
It's a repetitive
stress injury.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.107
That's what O.G. got,

05:46.140 --> 05:49.701
so he switched from playing
tournaments to streaming.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.445
He also worked as
a scout and an agent,

05:51.480 --> 05:52.811
so he would find
the best new players

05:52.850 --> 05:54.545
and then help them
negotiate their deals

05:54.580 --> 05:55.569
with the
corporate teams.

05:55.620 --> 05:57.144
So O.G. was acting as an agent

05:57.190 --> 06:00.489
in a brand-new sport with
no real regulation or oversight.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.829
How much are these deals worth?

06:02.860 --> 06:04.384
Tons. Millions.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.954
I mean, they say
it can get pretty crazy

06:05.990 --> 06:08.356
when two teams compete
over a hot new player.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.832
Do you think that's why
O.G. was attacked?

06:12.870 --> 06:15.498
(cell phone ringing)

06:15.540 --> 06:18.566
Oh. Excuse me, would you?

06:20.680 --> 06:22.648
Hey, where are you?

06:22.680 --> 06:24.102
HOLMES (over phone):
Where are you?

06:24.150 --> 06:26.141
The precinct. The captain
wanted to talk about...

06:26.180 --> 06:28.978
The violent assault
of one O.G. Pwnzr

06:29.020 --> 06:30.647
during a live
video stream, perhaps?

06:30.690 --> 06:32.817
You heard about it.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.112
An associate sent me video of
the attack just moments after.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.855
He was concerned that O.G.
might require

06:36.890 --> 06:38.084
medical assistance.

06:38.130 --> 06:39.688
So I began investigating
right away.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.755
And?

06:41.800 --> 06:42.767
I noticed an odd pattern
of lights

06:42.800 --> 06:44.062
in the corner of the video.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.897
I realized it was
two different billboards

06:45.930 --> 06:47.932
flashing outside O.G.'s window.

06:47.970 --> 06:49.608
I spent the last few hours
stalking midtown,

06:49.640 --> 06:51.961
searching for a location

06:52.010 --> 06:54.706
which faced two such billboards
at the right angles.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.037
My search was a success.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.206
You found the crime scene?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.478
That's the good news.

06:58.510 --> 07:00.046
The bad news is

07:00.080 --> 07:02.071
medical assistance
won't be reqUIred.

07:04.650 --> 07:06.618
So, as we know
from the live stream,

07:06.660 --> 07:08.651
the assailant,
likely a male

07:08.690 --> 07:10.783
with significant
upper-body strength,

07:10.830 --> 07:13.128
pistol-whipped O.G.,

07:13.160 --> 07:15.458
then smashed the camera,
ending the stream.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.491
He then secures O.G.
to the chair,

07:17.530 --> 07:19.498
using computer cables,

07:19.540 --> 07:21.030
and continued to beat him.

07:21.070 --> 07:22.935
So either someone really,
really didn't like the guy,

07:22.970 --> 07:24.767
or they wanted information
from him.

07:24.810 --> 07:28.029
These bruises would have taken
at least 30 minutes to develop.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.878
Implying that,
for reasons unknown,

07:30.910 --> 07:34.016
the killer paused his attack
for half an hour

07:34.050 --> 07:36.689
before delivering a final,
fatal series of blows.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.187
Well, these head wounds
aren't consistent

07:38.220 --> 07:39.915
with the butt of a gun.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.915
They are not.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.655
They were inflicted with

07:42.690 --> 07:45.022
a pointed metal object,
perhaps a hammer claw

07:45.060 --> 07:46.027
or garden trowel.

07:46.060 --> 07:46.992
Well, whatever it was,

07:47.030 --> 07:48.793
the killer took it with him
when he left.

07:48.830 --> 07:50.661
Who brings a gun
and a garden tool

07:50.700 --> 07:52.065
to commit a murder?

07:52.100 --> 07:54.933
Hopefully, this might
provide some insight.

07:54.970 --> 07:58.064
I resisted the temptation
to examine it

07:58.110 --> 08:00.203
before I could establish
proper chain of custody.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.037
You think it was
the victim's?

08:02.080 --> 08:04.105
There's one way
to find out.

08:09.020 --> 08:10.647
(phone beeps)

08:12.120 --> 08:15.578
_ Retina lock can still be
triggered hours after death.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.156
Ain't technology grand?

08:18.690 --> 08:20.749
O.G.'s real name is
Owen Tuchman,

08:20.800 --> 08:23.963
and he's i_nvolved_in at least
one dispute Via text.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.228
BELL:
"Do not cross me.

08:25.270 --> 08:28.091
Stay the hell
away from Tendu."

08:28.140 --> 08:29.164
Whatever that means.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.929
"Back off, or
I'll destroy you."

08:30.970 --> 08:33.029
These are all from
someone named Joey Ng.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.207
He's in contacts.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.049
Joey Ng of
ProFine Peripherals.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.570
Address in Williamsburg.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.847
Who's up for a drive?

08:41.880 --> 08:43.188
(school bell rings)

08:45.950 --> 08:47.713
SHINWELL:
Chivonne.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.557
I know you?

08:49.590 --> 08:51.080
I'm your...

08:51.130 --> 08:52.722
I'm Shinwell.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.819
You said you want
to talk?

08:54.860 --> 08:57.021
It's okay, guys.
Catch you later.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.133
You don't look like I remember.

09:01.170 --> 09:03.263
You, neither.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.335
What are you doing here?

09:05.370 --> 09:07.201
I texted you this morning; I
said I'll meet you after school.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.107
They don't let us have
our phones during school hours.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.043
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.741
If you're not ready
for this, then...

09:16.790 --> 09:17.745
It's okay.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.018
The truth is...

09:20.760 --> 09:23.228
...I'm in trouble,
and I need your help.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.251
Yeah, I sent those texts,

09:25.290 --> 09:27.224
but I didn't mean
anything by them.

09:27.260 --> 09:29.592
"Back off
or I'll destroy you."

09:29.630 --> 09:31.120
Three exclamation points.

09:31.170 --> 09:34.139
Well, I admit that was
a little over the top.

09:34.170 --> 09:35.899
Hey, guys, come on, focus.

09:35.940 --> 09:37.305
Don't worry
about this, okay?

09:37.340 --> 09:40.002
We got a tournament
coming up. Let's go!

09:40.040 --> 09:42.031
When we came here,
we were under the impression

09:42.080 --> 09:44.048
that this was your residence.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.173
Oh, it's a team house;
that's how we do it in eSports.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.314
I own the place,
and the team lives here

09:48.350 --> 09:50.386
so that they can practice
together all day.

09:50.420 --> 09:52.183
Yeah, we give them room
and board, salary, coaches,

09:52.220 --> 09:54.188
trainers, the works.

09:54.220 --> 09:55.619
According to O.G.'s
calendar app,

09:55.660 --> 09:56.786
he had several
meetings With you

09:56.830 --> 09:58.058
at this location
over the last week,

09:58.090 --> 10:01.059
all predating
your angry texts,

10:01.100 --> 10:02.727
and all on the subject
of something

10:02.770 --> 10:04.192
or someone called Tendu.

10:04.230 --> 10:07.063
They all go by nicknames,
and O.G. was Tendu's agent.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.636
So he found
this kid online,

10:08.670 --> 10:10.729
and he flew him down
from some nowhere town

10:10.770 --> 10:12.260
in northern Canada,

10:12.310 --> 10:13.777
and started shopping him
to teams.

10:13.810 --> 10:16.028
And O.G. and I,
we got into it.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.672
'Cause_Tendu wanted
to Sign With us,

10:17.710 --> 10:20.144
but O.G. kept trying to
steer him to one of our rivals.

10:20.180 --> 10:21.909
Joey, we're ready.

10:21.950 --> 10:23.212
Sorry. We're interrupting?

10:23.250 --> 10:25.639
Looks like we're the ones
interrupting.

10:25.690 --> 10:27.317
Uh, Anezka
and her friends

10:27.360 --> 10:29.828
are trade-show models
for the tournament this weekend.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.226
They're here to take publicity
photos with the team.

10:32.260 --> 10:33.693
You're police.

10:33.730 --> 10:35.027
Did Joey do something wrong?

10:35.060 --> 10:36.220
NG_:
No, we just...

10:36.260 --> 10:37.966
We're clearing up
a misunderstanding.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.298
Hey, why don't you, uh,
go hang out with the team, okay?

10:40.340 --> 10:43.662
I'll be right there.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.099
So, you were talking about
why you were angry with O.G.

10:46.140 --> 10:47.107
Right.

10:47.140 --> 10:48.368
Yeah, I was angry with him.

10:48.410 --> 10:49.968
ButI had no reason to kill him.

10:50.010 --> 10:51.375
I won.

10:51.410 --> 10:52.809
Tendu signed with Team ProFine.

10:53.880 --> 10:54.915
Now, O.G. was furious, okay?

10:54.950 --> 10:57.748
He kept badgering Tendu
to change his mind, but...

10:59.290 --> 11:01.679
Something wrong?

11:03.930 --> 11:06.251
Tendu was supposed
to be here by now,

11:06.290 --> 11:07.393
for the
publicity photos.

11:07.430 --> 11:10.399
Called him, like, an hour ago,
but he didn't answer.

11:10.430 --> 11:13.160
Wait, you don't think
whoever tried to kill O.G.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.929
went after him, also?

11:14.970 --> 11:16.801
We can't rule anything out.

11:16.840 --> 11:17.932
You know where
he was staying?

11:17.970 --> 11:19.779
I could send a car
to check on him.

11:19.810 --> 11:21.277
We need to talk
to him, too.

11:21.310 --> 11:22.470
I don't know for sure,

11:22.510 --> 11:24.899
but I bet he was
at the same hotel as O.G.

11:24.950 --> 11:28.010
There was only one room
registered under O.G.'s name.

11:28.050 --> 11:30.439
Then try looking under
Tendu's real name.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.412
I only learned it when we were
drawing up the contracts.

11:32.450 --> 11:34.179
It's Marcel Otolik.

11:34.220 --> 11:36.188
O-T-O-L-I-K.

11:36.220 --> 11:37.778
It's Eskimo or something.

11:50.140 --> 11:52.779
BELL:
All clear!

11:52.810 --> 11:54.437
No one's home.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.971
It's freezing in here. Is
there a window open somewhere?

11:57.010 --> 11:58.102
Yeah, in the bedroom.

11:58.150 --> 11:59.469
Otolik's an Inuit name.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.341
The address he registered
with the front desk

12:01.380 --> 12:03.484
is well north
of the Arctic Circle.

12:03.520 --> 12:07.012
So you can imagine he likes
things a little chilly.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.087
His companion,
on the other hand,

12:11.130 --> 12:14.054
might've preferred things
a bit warmer.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.328
His companion?

12:15.360 --> 12:16.497
Yeah, long brown hair.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.062
Looks like Tendu spent the night
in someone's warm embrace.

12:22.140 --> 12:23.903
Before they went out the window.

12:24.970 --> 12:27.234
Hand and shoe prints.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.812
HOLMES:
Male and female.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.148
So I find people rarely
exit rooms via windows

12:39.190 --> 12:41.556
when they're not fleeing
for their lives.

12:41.590 --> 12:44.354
Perhaps Owen Tuchman's killer
paid them a visit, too.

12:44.390 --> 12:45.823
That's one possibility.

12:45.860 --> 12:47.327
The other is that
they were worried

12:47.360 --> 12:49.089
that someone
would catch them with this.

12:50.530 --> 12:51.792
Looks like the murder weapon.

12:51.830 --> 12:53.036
BELL:
If that's a garden tool,

12:53.070 --> 12:55.038
it's not like one
I've ever seen.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.533
That is a hakapik.
(camera clicks)

12:57.570 --> 12:59.401
It's a seal-killing club

12:59.440 --> 13:00.771
favored by the Inuits.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.944
Judging by this inscription,
it is a going-away present,

13:05.980 --> 13:09.245
a little memento from home.

13:09.280 --> 13:12.386
This hook matches
O.G.'s head wounds.

13:12.420 --> 13:14.081
I'm gonna put out
a Finest Message.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.554
Looks like we got a suspect.

13:16.590 --> 13:17.557
By all means,
send your bulletin.

13:17.590 --> 13:18.989
We do need
to speak to Tendu.

13:19.030 --> 13:19.928
But not as a suspect.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.996
I mean, judging by
this murder weapon...

13:22.030 --> 13:23.019
I think he was framed.

13:31.940 --> 13:33.999
According to the lab, blood type
on the weapon is a match

13:34.040 --> 13:37.100
for Owen "O.G." Tuchman,
and this guy

13:37.150 --> 13:38.503
Tendu's prints
are all over it.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.871
But you two
still think he was framed?

13:40.920 --> 13:42.842
Well, circumstantial evidence
is a very triclq thing.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.118
It might seem to
point very straight

13:44.150 --> 13:47.415
to one thing, but if you shift
your own point of view a little,

13:47.460 --> 13:49.985
you may find it pointing in
an equally uncompromising manner

13:50.030 --> 13:51.349
to something entirely different.

13:51.390 --> 13:52.618
Well, I don't know
how you shift this.

13:52.660 --> 13:55.390
The blood matches the victim,
and the hook matches the wounds.

13:55.430 --> 13:57.864
The hook. Precisely.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.390
Tendu is an Inuit male

13:59.430 --> 14:01.159
from a traditional
Inuit village.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.532
Hence, he's likely killed
hundreds of seals.

14:03.570 --> 14:06.368
Only, seal hunters do not kill

14:06.410 --> 14:08.401
with the hook side
of the hakapik.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.102
That's used for hauling
seal carcasses onto the boats.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.414
To kill, the hunters
use the hammer.

14:13.450 --> 14:16.248
So if he had he swung this club,
Tendu would likely have killed

14:16.280 --> 14:20.011
O.G. with a single blow from the
hammer directly to the temple.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.551
Okay. So what went down?
From your shifted point of view.

14:22.590 --> 14:25.184
Well, imagine
for one moment that Tendu

14:25.230 --> 14:27.255
was the killer's
intended target.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.653
Only, he couldn't
find him.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.224
O.G. had taken pains

14:30.270 --> 14:32.966
to keep Tendu's whereabouts
a secret.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.231
O.G. himself, however, he'd been
out and about in the city,

14:36.270 --> 14:37.362
he'd been taking meetings,

14:37.410 --> 14:39.139
he'd been negotiating
for his clients.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.307
He_would've been
relatively easy to find

14:40.340 --> 14:41.534
and follow back to the hotel.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.172
BELL: We think
that's why O.G.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.474
was tortured
before he was killed.

14:45.510 --> 14:48.047
The perp wanted him to give up
Tendu's location.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.570
HOLMES:
O.G. submitted.

14:49.620 --> 14:52.214
The killer goes to Tendu's room,
tries to enter.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.582
He's delayed by
the security latch

14:54.620 --> 14:56.554
on the door.

14:56.590 --> 14:58.228
Fresh abrasions
on the metal suggest

14:58.260 --> 15:00.399
that it was forcefully engaged
and then defeated.

15:00.430 --> 15:02.398
Only, by that time,
Tendu had escaped.

15:02.430 --> 15:04.523
So the guy comes up
empty-handed, but he isn't ready

15:04.570 --> 15:06.697
to give up,
so he finds the kid's club

15:06.730 --> 15:08.937
and he takes it back
to Owen Tuchman's room.

15:08.970 --> 15:10.335
He couldn't kill Tendu.

15:10.370 --> 15:11.632
He settled for framing him.

15:13.510 --> 15:15.398
My niece mentioned that there's

15:15.440 --> 15:16.532
some big gaming tournament

15:16.580 --> 15:19.344
this weekend-- the first prize
is two million bucks.

15:19.380 --> 15:21.575
Maybe somebody wanted Tendu
out of the picture.

15:21.620 --> 15:24.418
We thought about that, but he
wasn't due to play this weekend.

15:24.450 --> 15:26.611
So him being dead, or on the run

15:26.650 --> 15:28.356
wouldn't have affected
the outcome.

15:28.390 --> 15:32.224
Hmm. What about this brunette
you think he was With?

15:32.260 --> 15:34.421
Any more on her?
HOLMES: Not yet.

15:34.460 --> 15:37.725
Watson's at home combing
through Tendu's social media.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.228
Hopefully, we'll have answers
to our questions soon.

15:41.270 --> 15:43.738
* Will you pray for the end?

15:43.770 --> 15:45.965
(death metal music
playing loudly)

15:47.680 --> 15:49.500
You're listening to Goatwhore?

15:49.540 --> 15:51.508
Trying to stay awake!
(music stops)

15:51.550 --> 15:55.111
Been going through this stuff
for five hours straight.

15:55.150 --> 15:58.119
It turns out Tendu isn't big
on words, but he loves photos.

15:58.150 --> 15:59.310
He posted a
few dozen a day,

15:59.350 --> 16:01.989
every day, for the
last five years.

16:03.690 --> 16:06.124
That's 30,000 pictures,
give or take.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.252
Unfortunately,
he only posted a few

16:07.300 --> 16:08.528
since he arrived in New York,

16:08.560 --> 16:10.118
none since
O.G.'s murder.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.523
Nothing with a new girlfriend,

16:11.570 --> 16:13.299
no hint that he might
be in trouble,

16:13.340 --> 16:15.558
or where he
might be hiding.

16:17.070 --> 16:18.401
He has quite the fan base.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.476
Yeah, over 100,000 followers.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.479
Some of these photographs
went viral

16:24.510 --> 16:26.671
before he became known
as an eSports star.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.177
Over 10,000 shares.

16:28.220 --> 16:29.209
What's so special
about that one?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.210
(phone chiming)

16:32.250 --> 16:33.751
Shinwell.

16:33.790 --> 16:36.350
He wants me to meet him
first thing in the morning.

16:36.390 --> 16:37.618
You should turn in
for the night.

16:37.660 --> 16:40.151
We're done here.
What? Just like that?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.088
Well, you're fatigued,
or else you would've noticed.

16:42.130 --> 16:45.167
Not only did Tendu's most
popular selfie likely motivate

16:45.200 --> 16:47.088
the attempt on his life,
but the comments section

16:47.140 --> 16:49.233
has also given us
a promising suspect.

16:53.210 --> 16:55.178
Ms. Lundquist, you promised
your client would come in

16:55.210 --> 16:56.575
on her own recognizance.

16:56.610 --> 16:58.749
I could send _
a couple of detectives.

16:58.780 --> 17:00.714
I'm sorry, Raina will be here.
And you'll see,

17:00.750 --> 17:02.615
she has nothing to do

17:02.650 --> 17:04.117
with Whatever this is.

17:04.150 --> 17:05.583
She's a good person.

17:05.620 --> 17:07.178
Can a fanatic be a good person?

17:07.220 --> 17:09.757
In my experience,
the answer's almost always no.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.280
She's not a fanatic.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.423
She's... devoted.

17:13.460 --> 17:14.597
Makes it hard for her

17:14.630 --> 17:16.598
to keep a schedule sometimes.

17:16.630 --> 17:17.790
Hi.

17:17.830 --> 17:19.661
I'm so sorry I'm late.
It's okay.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.736
It's okay.
I forgot to charge
my car last night.

17:21.770 --> 17:23.101
Hi, hi.

17:23.140 --> 17:25.665
I am so, so glad

17:25.710 --> 17:27.701
that you granted
my request for this meeting.

17:27.740 --> 17:30.743
We cannot wait to free
these gorgeous horses.

17:30.780 --> 17:31.849
Horses?

17:31.880 --> 17:33.643
Of course.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.376
We're here to discuss
the NYPD Mounted Unit, right?

17:36.420 --> 17:38.547
Ending equine slavery.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.581
While this meeting does
have to do with your position

17:40.620 --> 17:43.851
as CEO of the Animal Salvation
Fund, Ms. Karnow,

17:43.890 --> 17:46.427
horse emancipation is not
on the docket, I'm afraid.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.428
Rather, we would like
to discuss your campaign

17:48.460 --> 17:49.791
to end seal hunting.

17:53.870 --> 17:55.428
LUNDQUIST:
A selfie?

17:55.470 --> 17:57.563
Sealfie, actually.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.408
You and your group have branded
seal hunting barbaric.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.443
But the so-called barbarians,
in this modern day and age,

18:03.480 --> 18:05.345
well, they also have
access to cell phones

18:05.380 --> 18:07.416
and social media,
just like you do.

18:07.450 --> 18:09.645
LUNDQUIST:
You told me you wanted to
talk to Raina about a crime.

18:09.680 --> 18:10.886
I think you should cut
to the chase.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.547
As your client
well knows,

18:12.590 --> 18:15.514
the Sealfie movement
was started by the Inuits

18:15.560 --> 18:17.619
to counter outside pressure
to end seal hunting.

18:17.660 --> 18:19.525
Sealfies show
that the Inuit's very survival

18:19.560 --> 18:21.255
and culture depends
on the practice.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.518
The young man in this
photograph, for example,

18:23.570 --> 18:27.438
Tendu, he's wearing seal skin,
he's, uh, eating seal jerlq.

18:27.470 --> 18:28.494
BELL_: _He's also
a rismg star

18:28.540 --> 18:30.360
in the world of eSports.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.230
That made him
one of the movement's

18:32.270 --> 18:34.306
more visible proponents.

18:34.340 --> 18:37.548
His Sealfies went viral, causing
you a lot of embarrassment.

18:37.580 --> 18:39.798
You even _lost a few
of your celebrity supporters.

18:39.850 --> 18:41.545
And how did you respond?

18:41.580 --> 18:45.186
By threatening him in the
comments section of his posts.

18:45.220 --> 18:47.381
"If you continue to support
this senseless slaughter,

18:47.420 --> 18:50.719
you and your people deserve--"
in all caps-- "extinction."

18:50.760 --> 18:52.819
Two nights ago,
this man was murdered

18:52.860 --> 18:54.851
with a seal-killing club

18:54.900 --> 18:56.253
that belongs to Tendu.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.188
The person who did this

18:58.230 --> 18:59.822
was trying to frame him.

18:59.870 --> 19:01.269
HOLMES: Not quite
as drastic as killing him,

19:01.300 --> 19:03.734
but an effective way
to silence his voice.

19:03.770 --> 19:05.306
Okay, this is crazy.

19:05.340 --> 19:06.830
The posts that
you're referring to,

19:06.870 --> 19:09.304
Raina told me about
them weeks ago.

19:09.340 --> 19:12.309
She regretted them and thought
there might be consequences.

19:12.350 --> 19:13.942
But I'm gonna tell you
exactly what I told her.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.278
Not one word of What she
wrote was actionable.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.948
So if you think you're gonna
turn this into a basis

19:18.990 --> 19:20.685
_of a homicide
investigation...

19:20.720 --> 19:22.517
Tendu and I had a meeting.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.323
Two days ago.
What?

19:24.360 --> 19:25.759
Well, I didn't tell you
'cause I thought

19:25.790 --> 19:27.724
if an attorney was there,
it might scare him away.

19:29.330 --> 19:31.264
We met in my office,
and we made a deal.

19:32.330 --> 19:34.195
I promised to support
indigenous seal hunting

19:34.240 --> 19:36.697
_ if he would come out
against commerCIal seal hunts.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.469
Commercial hunts
killing 20 times

19:38.510 --> 19:40.307
as many seals as the Inuits.

19:40.340 --> 19:43.343
Yeah, last thing
I would want is Tendu dead

19:43.380 --> 19:44.506
or in some kind
of trouble.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.472
Can you prove any of this?

19:46.510 --> 19:48.717
I have a draft of the
agreement at my office.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.889
We both signed it.
I can send you a copy.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.615
You can ask other
people at the meeting.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.756
My assistant,
Tendu's girlfriend, Libena.

19:55.790 --> 19:58.588
Libena-- that's a Czech name.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.359
I guess so.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.925
I don't know,
she had a thick accent.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.666
Why? Is that important?

20:06.330 --> 20:07.638
(knocking)

20:10.810 --> 20:12.300
Thanks for coming.

20:12.340 --> 20:13.637
Of course.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.739
You okay?

20:15.780 --> 20:18.408
You don't look
so good.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.747
(lock clicks)

20:19.780 --> 20:21.919
I didn't get much
sleep last night.

20:21.950 --> 20:24.680
Why? Did something happen
with SBK?

20:24.720 --> 20:26.483
Nope.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.613
Something happened
with Chivonne.

20:36.430 --> 20:38.864
There's a banger.

20:38.900 --> 20:40.891
Lucien.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.965
He a player,
runs some corners.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.661
He got it in his head
that Chivonne

20:44.710 --> 20:46.507
is gonna be
his girlfriend.

20:46.540 --> 20:48.337
And he don't care What
she got to say about it.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.404
What do you mean?

20:49.440 --> 20:50.668
Happens sometimes.

20:50.710 --> 20:52.644
Youngblood sees something
he likes,

20:52.680 --> 20:56.047
decides it's his.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.844
Doesn't matter
that she don't like him.

20:58.890 --> 21:00.812
It don't matter
that she just 14.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.055
One way or another,

21:03.090 --> 21:04.057
he gonna get what he wants.

21:04.090 --> 21:09.790
Now, this boy, Lucien,
he keep coming at her,

21:09.830 --> 21:14.938
got his boys following her,
just making her life hell.

21:14.970 --> 21:17.404
Did she talk to the police?

21:17.440 --> 21:19.761
You mean did she snitch? No.

21:19.810 --> 21:22.699
She worried that it's gonna
come back on her and her aunt,

21:22.740 --> 21:24.503
and it would.

21:24.550 --> 21:25.949
That's Why she
came to me.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.811
What did she ask you to do?

21:27.850 --> 21:30.546
I wouldn't let her
say the words...

21:32.890 --> 21:36.451
...but I know What
she need me to do.

21:36.490 --> 21:39.926
And truth is... I want to do it.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.520
That's my baby girl.

21:42.560 --> 21:47.099
Anybody mess with her,
they deserve what they get.

21:47.130 --> 21:49.997
Crazy, huh?

21:50.040 --> 21:51.598
Everything I've been doing,
working with you,

21:51.640 --> 21:54.871
working with the police,
it was so, eventually,

21:54.910 --> 21:57.378
I can be a father to her.

21:59.150 --> 22:02.916
Turns out What she really need
is a gangster.

22:04.790 --> 22:07.611
I don't blame you for wanting
to protect your daughter.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.629
But if you hurt Lucien...

22:10.660 --> 22:13.049
you know What could happen
if his gang finds out

22:13.090 --> 22:14.796
What you did and why.

22:16.830 --> 22:18.889
Eye for an eye.

22:18.930 --> 22:20.636
They gonna come after me.

22:20.670 --> 22:23.935
Or worse,
take it out on Chivonne.

22:23.970 --> 22:25.631
That's Why I
asked you here.

22:25.670 --> 22:26.932
Talk me out of it,

22:26.970 --> 22:29.575
to help me find another way.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.770
Hey.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.071
What are you guys doing here?

22:36.120 --> 22:37.644
We were just having
an illuminating conversation

22:37.690 --> 22:38.918
with Anezka here.

22:38.950 --> 22:41.487
Thanks. You can go.
We'll be in touch.

22:47.090 --> 22:48.648
What's going on?

22:48.700 --> 22:49.724
HOLMES:
Were you aware

22:49.760 --> 22:51.466
that when Tendu disappeared,

22:51.500 --> 22:53.730
he was in the company
of a woman named Libena Havel?

22:53.770 --> 22:56.398
No. No, I wasn't.

22:56.440 --> 22:57.930
BELL: Apparently,
she's his girlfriend.

22:57.970 --> 22:59.665
When we heard her name,
it struck us

22:59.710 --> 23:02.474
that we'd already met
one Czech woman, Anezka.

23:02.510 --> 23:04.102
Having two different
Czechs wrapped up

23:04.150 --> 23:06.675
in the same case seemed like
more than a c0inCIdence.

23:06.710 --> 23:08.541
HOLMES: We wondered if she
and Anezka knew each other.

23:08.580 --> 23:10.639
If they did, Anezka could
help us find Libena,

23:10.690 --> 23:12.817
which, in turn, could
help us find Tendu.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.784
Anezka gave us this,

23:14.820 --> 23:17.186
from a gaming convention
a few months back.

23:17.220 --> 23:19.188
Sheidenﬁﬁed
this girl as Libena,

23:19.230 --> 23:21.198
another of your
trade show models.

23:21.230 --> 23:24.028
She said Libena and Tendu
met at a party last week,

23:24.070 --> 23:25.059
here at this house.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.021
Yeah.

23:26.070 --> 23:26.695
HOLMES: She also told us
that she and Libena

23:26.730 --> 23:28.459
were more than just models.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.535
They're prostitutes.

23:29.570 --> 23:31.959
BELL:
But you already knew that.

23:32.010 --> 23:33.807
They get close
to the players,

23:33.840 --> 23:36.707
flirt with them; when you get
the feeling a player wants more,

23:36.740 --> 23:38.207
you make sure it happens.
HOLMES: And the
players themselves,

23:38.250 --> 23:39.899
they don't know the truth.

23:39.950 --> 23:41.713
And that way, they're not just
more likely to stay,

23:41.750 --> 23:43.047
they're more likely
to recommend Team ProFine

23:43.080 --> 23:45.446
to other eSport stars.

23:45.490 --> 23:48.653
Anezka told us Libena
fell for Tendu, hard.

23:48.690 --> 23:50.749
She was thinking about telling
him the truth about herself.

23:50.790 --> 23:51.950
Say she did.

23:51.990 --> 23:53.594
Say it made him angry.

23:53.630 --> 23:56.190
He confronted you,
threatened to expose you.

23:56.230 --> 23:57.891
Your team could've been barred
from competition.

23:57.930 --> 23:59.625
Tendu had to go.

23:59.670 --> 24:01.490
Only, you didn't know
Where he was staying,

24:01.540 --> 24:04.509
so maybe you paid
Owen "O.G." Tuchman a visit.

24:04.540 --> 24:08.078
What?! No, that...
that's not What happened.

24:08.110 --> 24:09.805
Well, Anezka seems to think

24:09.840 --> 24:11.671
it's a quite likely
sequence of events.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.071
All right, look, you are right
about the girls,

24:16.120 --> 24:18.645
and you're right
that Tendu found out.

24:18.690 --> 24:21.557
Only, he didn't threaten me,
he came to me for help.

24:21.590 --> 24:22.682
With What?

24:22.720 --> 24:24.119
The escort agency
that we use,

24:24.160 --> 24:25.957
they're not good people. Okay?

24:25.990 --> 24:28.094
They bring these girls into the
country, then extort them for,

24:28.130 --> 24:30.223
like, tens of thousands
of dollars in immigration fees.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.125
They literally
hold the girls' passports

24:32.170 --> 24:34.866
and take 90% of What they earn
until their debts are paid.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.266
So, Tendu wanted to buy
Libena's freedom.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.574
He wanted to negotiate
with human traffickers?

24:40.610 --> 24:43.579
Yes. Then he tells me if
they don't want to play ball,

24:43.610 --> 24:45.874
he knows enough about computers
to track down the people

24:45.910 --> 24:47.002
behind the agency,

24:47.050 --> 24:48.711
and identify them to the police.

24:48.750 --> 24:50.240
And I told him,
look, trying to deal

24:50.280 --> 24:52.248
with people like that
is a bad idea.

24:52.290 --> 24:54.110
And then to threaten them?
That's even worse.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.617
So, I refused
to front him the money,

24:56.660 --> 24:58.127
because I didn't want
to encourage him.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.684
But maybe he did, anyway.

24:59.730 --> 25:00.992
If he did...

25:01.030 --> 25:04.989
The escort agency--
you got the address?

25:08.700 --> 25:11.828
Well, yeah, we need
everything you got.

25:11.870 --> 25:12.962
Sooner the better.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.705
What's going on?

25:14.740 --> 25:16.879
Your text said you were
looking into an escort agency.

25:16.910 --> 25:18.275
That was the idea.

25:18.310 --> 25:20.141
He's on the phone
with the fire marshal.

25:20.180 --> 25:21.772
Based on the weathering

25:21.820 --> 25:23.913
of this tape and the
graying of the ash,

25:23.950 --> 25:24.939
the place was burned
down two days ago.

25:36.930 --> 25:39.091
No question it was arson.
Agency's computers

25:39.130 --> 25:41.098
and paperwork were all covered
with gasoline and lit up.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.994
Problem is finding who did it.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.701
Agency employees all vanished.

25:44.740 --> 25:47.903
Paperwork's gone, and the names
that I could find are fake.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.828
The Whole thing was owned
by a shell company.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.871
Sounds like
organized crime.
Yeah.

25:51.910 --> 25:53.616
I wish I could
tell you which kind.

25:53.650 --> 25:54.912
Office manager was named

25:54.950 --> 25:56.611
Carla Petro,

25:56.650 --> 25:58.140
but nobody who met her
thought she looked Italian,

25:58.190 --> 25:59.919
and her name is as fake
as the rest.

26:00.990 --> 26:02.685
Is he okay?

26:02.720 --> 26:04.824
He's fine.

26:06.890 --> 26:08.858
Your arsonist was driving

26:08.900 --> 26:10.822
a fully-restored,
vintage Ford Mustang,

26:10.870 --> 26:13.259
model year 1965, '66, '67

26:13.300 --> 26:14.858
or '68.

26:14.900 --> 26:15.889
Color unknown.

26:15.940 --> 26:17.293
How can you know that?

26:17.340 --> 26:18.830
You say in your report

26:18.870 --> 26:20.030
you found a charred
wastebasket inside.

26:20.070 --> 26:22.277
You thought it was used to
splash petrol around the office.

26:22.310 --> 26:23.231
So?

26:23.280 --> 26:25.043
So, Why did the arsonist
use a waste basket?

26:25.080 --> 26:26.877
Why not a gas can?
I'll tell you why.

26:26.910 --> 26:28.969
Because the petrol didn't come
from a can, it came from a car,

26:29.020 --> 26:29.975
which was parked right here.

26:30.020 --> 26:31.317
It was siphoned.

26:31.350 --> 26:34.148
There's spilled petrol
on the floor here,

26:34.190 --> 26:37.318
and it has the distinct aroma
of additives used for

26:37.360 --> 26:39.328
fueling old cars
with modern unleaded.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.897
Additionally,
there are scratches here

26:41.930 --> 26:43.158
which could only have come

26:43.200 --> 26:45.725
from the three-bladed spinning
hubcaps of a classic Mustang.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.136
So, you said this garage was
leased by the agency, right?

26:48.170 --> 26:50.058
Yeah.
And the people
who worked here

26:50.100 --> 26:52.159
are the ones we think
started the fire?

26:52.210 --> 26:55.702
You want to put the Mustang
over the air, or should I?

26:57.110 --> 27:01.319
Yo, Ghostface,
I got that tuna you like.

27:01.350 --> 27:03.079
SHINWELL:
Your cat took off.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.816
I don't think
he liked the look of me.

27:05.850 --> 27:07.750
Who the hell
do you think you are?

27:07.790 --> 27:08.757
Shinwell.

27:08.790 --> 27:10.109
I'm Chivonne's father.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.354
Given the way
you've been treating

27:12.390 --> 27:13.857
my baby girl,

27:13.900 --> 27:16.824
stalking her,
making her life hell,

27:16.860 --> 27:18.168
by rights,

27:18.200 --> 27:19.690
you should be lying

27:19.730 --> 27:22.290
in a pool of your own blood
right now.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.308
That supposed to scare me?
No.

27:24.340 --> 27:26.228
You hard.

27:26.270 --> 27:29.831
Hard G's, you either drop
or you don't.

27:29.880 --> 27:34.010
Luckily for you, I'm trying
to live a peaceable life.

27:34.050 --> 27:36.371
I come to make you a offer.

27:36.420 --> 27:37.842
What kind of offer?

27:37.890 --> 27:38.948
I been looking
into you.

27:38.990 --> 27:43.154
You got three corners,
a decent amount of product.

27:43.190 --> 27:45.988
If you wasn't so damn stupid
when it came to the girls,

27:46.030 --> 27:47.452
you would have
a good thing going.

27:47.490 --> 27:49.856
Look, my business
is my business.

27:49.900 --> 27:52.425
Maybe it's time for you
to put your business first.

27:57.840 --> 28:01.139
SBK got two corners
near your territory.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.273
Now, I can arrange
for the dealers

28:03.310 --> 28:05.175
to move out.

28:05.210 --> 28:08.941
Your people can move in,
doubling

28:08.980 --> 28:10.140
your profit.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.114
Now, in exchange,

28:12.150 --> 28:14.948
I want you and yours
to leave my daughter alone.

28:16.460 --> 28:19.156
Forever.

28:19.190 --> 28:20.327
Or?

28:20.360 --> 28:21.896
No need for "or."

28:21.930 --> 28:25.263
You know a good deal
when you hear it,

28:25.300 --> 28:27.461
and I'm only
offering once.

28:34.410 --> 28:36.378
(door opens)

28:36.410 --> 28:39.072
Hello, Carla, or...

28:39.110 --> 28:41.374
do you prefer Amanda?

28:41.420 --> 28:44.947
Or Tasha?

28:44.990 --> 28:46.241
Carla is fine.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.212
Carla.

28:48.260 --> 28:51.923
Well, your prints tell
an interesting story, Carla.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.825
Multiple arrests
for prostitution

28:53.860 --> 28:57.296
under various aliases
dating back over 20 years,

28:57.330 --> 28:58.524
and then a gap.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.265
And then,
two years ago,

29:00.300 --> 29:02.791
a misdemeanor for
promoting prostitution.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.137
Looks like you went
into management.

29:04.170 --> 29:06.809
Made enough to buy
that vintage Mustang

29:06.840 --> 29:08.330
we pulled you over in.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.336
And now you
can add arson

29:10.380 --> 29:13.042
to your list of accomplishments.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.219
BELL: Maybe murder, as well.
This man...

29:15.250 --> 29:17.241
She's prepared to take
the fall for her crimes,

29:17.280 --> 29:18.383
Whatever they are.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.489
Likely due to
a combination of fear

29:19.520 --> 29:20.919
of her employers

29:20.960 --> 29:23.053
and the promise
of future compensation.

29:23.090 --> 29:25.229
Spent her Whole life
in the sex trade.

29:25.260 --> 29:27.228
_ She's used to
trading herself for money.

29:27.260 --> 29:29.490
Didn't ask you
how your emergency meeting

29:29.530 --> 29:31.122
with Shinwell went.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.523
Did you manage
to avert his crisis?

29:32.570 --> 29:35.937
Well, I tried to point him
in the right direction.

29:35.970 --> 29:37.835
GREGSON: We already have you
on the arson.

29:41.240 --> 29:44.243
I spilled gasoline by accident.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.248
I dropped a cigarette.

29:46.280 --> 29:48.419
Clumsy me.

29:50.550 --> 29:53.348
But I didn't send anyone
after the boy,

29:53.390 --> 29:55.255
Tendu.

29:55.290 --> 29:56.882
Neither did
the people I work for.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.558
They don't even know his name.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.251
GREGSON:
You had motive,

30:01.300 --> 30:03.291
and we have reason to believe
that Tendu uncovered

30:03.330 --> 30:05.423
the names of all your bosses.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.268
He threatened
to expose all of you.

30:08.300 --> 30:13.033
He did, but he also offered me
a deal, which I took.

30:14.310 --> 30:15.402
He's a nice boy.

30:17.140 --> 30:20.007
And I was happy for Libena.

30:20.050 --> 30:23.042
She found her Richard Gere.

30:23.080 --> 30:26.049
Girls from poor cities,
broken homes,

30:26.090 --> 30:29.389
they get into the trade
because they want to escape,

30:29.420 --> 30:30.387
make some money,

30:30.420 --> 30:33.526
and someday

30:33.560 --> 30:35.255
live the dream.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.996
Meet a wonderful man,
fall in love,

30:38.030 --> 30:39.566
live happily ever after,

30:39.600 --> 30:41.431
like Julia Roberts
from the movie.

30:44.070 --> 30:47.130
For most of us,
there is no Richard Gere.

30:47.170 --> 30:48.432
It's a fantasy.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.199
Libena and the boy
seemed to be in love,

30:51.250 --> 30:53.138
and he offered
to pay off her debt,

30:53.180 --> 30:58.914
so I gave them their chance
at the fairy tale.

30:58.950 --> 31:00.486
And then What?

31:00.520 --> 31:03.182
You figured if Tendu
was able to identify you

31:03.220 --> 31:05.188
and the agency's owners,
other people could, too?

31:06.430 --> 31:07.988
You burned down your office
to cover your tracks?

31:08.030 --> 31:11.067
$100,000 is more than enough

31:11.100 --> 31:13.625
to replace some old computers
and open a new office.

31:13.670 --> 31:15.558
GREGSON: Tendu said
he was gonna pay you

31:15.600 --> 31:17.192
a hundred thou?

31:17.240 --> 31:20.368
He didn't say he would do it.
He did it.

31:20.410 --> 31:22.275
Paid me on the spot.

31:22.310 --> 31:23.538
In cash?

31:23.580 --> 31:26.003
Brand new hundred dollar bills.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.211
Joey Ng told us he hadn't
given Tendu any money.

31:28.250 --> 31:29.979
Did he say Where he got it?

31:30.020 --> 31:32.386
Mm, sorry.

31:32.420 --> 31:35.651
When someone hands me money,
I don't ask where it came from.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.654
Force of habit.

31:40.390 --> 31:42.950
Fire marshals will be by
to talk with her next.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.997
Any impressions?

31:46.030 --> 31:48.237
IfI had to guess, I'd say
she was telling the truth.

31:48.270 --> 31:50.158
Where's Joan?
She's at your computer.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.636
Said she has a theory as to
how Tendu got his $100,000.

31:53.670 --> 31:55.171
What do you got?

31:55.210 --> 31:56.438
Oh, hey.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.277
So, this is one of
the last pictures

31:58.310 --> 32:01.575
that Tendu uploaded
to social media.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.679
Now, the logo belongs to
a company called AmpVX.

32:03.720 --> 32:06.188
They make top-of-the-line
headphones.

32:06.220 --> 32:09.053
According to this,
the headphones he's wearing

32:09.090 --> 32:10.978
haven't even been released yet.
A friend of mine

32:11.030 --> 32:13.055
who dated a Met once, she said
the guy never wore brand name

32:13.090 --> 32:14.489
unless he was
getting paid.

32:14.530 --> 32:16.953
Tendu is a professional
athlete now.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.627
Significant percentage
of the money athletes make

32:18.670 --> 32:20.319
is from
sponsorship deals.

32:20.370 --> 32:22.634
How do we get ahold
of someone from AmpVX?

32:22.670 --> 32:24.262
There won't be anyone in the
New York office until tomorrow.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.607
But?

32:25.640 --> 32:28.700
In Beijing...
it's already tomorrow.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.246
WATSON:
Hao.

32:33.650 --> 32:35.174
Your call went well.
It did.

32:36.320 --> 32:37.275
What is that?

32:37.320 --> 32:39.242
That's roasted huitlacoche.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.157
It's corn smut.
Do you want some?

32:42.190 --> 32:44.078
Ugh. No thanks.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.690
So, the VP at AmpVX's
Beijing headquarters said

32:46.730 --> 32:48.698
they signed Tendu
to a five-year,

32:48.730 --> 32:50.425
multi-millio_n dollar
sponsorship deal.

32:50.460 --> 32:53.395
He collected a $100,000 advance
from their New York office

32:53.430 --> 32:54.567
the day he bought
Libena's freedom.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.090
Explains the money.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.630
Ms. Jao also said that Tendu

32:57.670 --> 32:59.706
had the company Wire
$20,000 each

32:59.740 --> 33:01.435
to several people in his village

33:01.480 --> 33:02.708
in Maniitok, Canada.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.139
He wanted the payments
to continue

33:04.180 --> 33:05.374
for the life of his contract.

33:05.410 --> 33:08.311
But he also wanted to make sure
he could stop the payments

33:08.350 --> 33:11.080
if the recipients didn't fulfill
certain conditions.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.246
The payments were incentives.

33:12.290 --> 33:15.487
He wanted to ensure certain
prominent Citizens in Maniitok

33:15.520 --> 33:18.250
did something that they already
desperately wanted to do.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.588
How could you already know that?

33:20.630 --> 33:23.053
You tend to project
when you speak Mandarin.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.727
I overheard enough
to get the gist,

33:24.770 --> 33:26.362
so I contacted the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police

33:26.400 --> 33:27.367
in Maniitok to see

33:27.400 --> 33:28.662
if any of their officers

33:28.700 --> 33:30.531
could provide any insight,
and Officer Montcalm

33:30.570 --> 33:32.265
has been giving me
an overview of

33:32.310 --> 33:33.629
_ a certain situation
in Tendu's hometown.

33:35.180 --> 33:38.672
That, in combination with
the names of Tendu's payees

33:38.710 --> 33:40.473
and their views regarding

33:40.510 --> 33:42.114
the future of Maniitok,

33:42.150 --> 33:44.618
allowed me to deduce
the goal of the payments,

33:44.650 --> 33:46.743
not to mention Why
Owen Tuchman was murdered

33:46.790 --> 33:48.280
and Tendu framed.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.379
I don't get it.
Are you saying all of this

33:50.420 --> 33:53.218
is because of local politics
in an Inuit village?

33:53.260 --> 33:55.319
The local politics
are just a symptom.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.493
O.G.'s murder was ultimately
triggered by something

33:59.530 --> 34:00.758
far larger in scope.

34:00.800 --> 34:01.789
He died because of
global warming.

34:20.650 --> 34:22.083
Any sign of the guy?

34:22.120 --> 34:23.758
Not yet.

34:23.790 --> 34:26.327
Our techs pinged
his cell phone to a tower

34:26.360 --> 34:27.622
right around the corner.

34:27.660 --> 34:29.548
He's definitely
around here somewhere.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.192
You sure he's
our killer?

34:31.230 --> 34:33.528
Kurt Godwyn is a fixer
for Mather and Kline.

34:33.570 --> 34:36.437
He does all the dirty work for
an exceedingly dirty law firm.

34:36.470 --> 34:38.665
So, if they sent anyone
to kill Tendu three nights ago,

34:38.710 --> 34:40.666
I'll bet it was him.

34:40.710 --> 34:41.870
There he is.

34:41.910 --> 34:43.798
Brown jacket.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.307
That's him.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.102
I think I see a parking spot--

34:47.150 --> 34:49.471
What...
(car door closes)

34:49.520 --> 34:52.182
(car horns continue honking)

34:52.220 --> 34:54.211
*

35:18.280 --> 35:19.907
If you move, I'm gonna put
six rounds in your liver.

35:19.950 --> 35:20.871
Police!

35:20.910 --> 35:22.616
Are we clear?
Clear.

35:22.650 --> 35:24.538
Get your hands
up on the wall now.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.844
HOLMES:
Right pocket.

35:28.390 --> 35:29.550
Don't move.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.669
That isn't a gun.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.302
No, but you're under arrest.

35:46.340 --> 35:48.399
Couldn't wait for me
to park the car?

35:48.440 --> 35:50.806
I could see he was armed and
heading into this building.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.842
What's so special
about this building?

35:52.880 --> 35:55.178
Carla Petro was
arrested here once.

35:55.220 --> 35:56.949
It was thought that her
employers kept an apartment here

35:56.980 --> 35:58.948
so that the girls
could entertain clients.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.515
Just the kind of place
Libena might go to hide?

36:01.560 --> 36:02.913
You got this all wrong.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.689
I'm just here
to serve a summons.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.186
Yeah, right.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.897
Tendu? Libena?

36:09.930 --> 36:11.295
Police are here.

36:11.330 --> 36:12.661
You're safe.

36:13.970 --> 36:15.369
Show your badge.

36:30.280 --> 36:33.249
You gonna tell me why
I'm looking at a map of Canada?

36:33.290 --> 36:35.451
In a minute.

36:35.490 --> 36:37.481
We know what you do for
a living, Mr. Goden.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.852
Your business card may say
"legal investigator,"

36:39.890 --> 36:41.494
but you're a fixer.

36:41.530 --> 36:43.555
When your law firm
or their clients have a problem,

36:43.600 --> 36:44.897
you make the problem go away.

36:44.930 --> 36:47.569
HOLMES: You were
suspected in the sudden,

36:47.600 --> 36:50.489
inexplicable death of the jury
foreman on the Himmelman case.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.267
You were accused of
threatening Witnesses

36:53.310 --> 36:54.834
in Brust v. Zerakem,

36:54.880 --> 36:57.405
bribing a judge in
the LexGo Glass lawsuit.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.442
Three indictments,
no convictions.

36:59.480 --> 37:02.938
A winning streak which, I assure
you, is about to come to an end.

37:02.980 --> 37:05.289
Man named Owen Tuchman

37:05.320 --> 37:06.947
was beaten to death
late Thursday night.

37:06.990 --> 37:08.810
Surveillance cameras
recorded you

37:08.860 --> 37:11.454
in and around his hotel
at the time of the murder.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.026
And the gun we found
in your possession

37:13.060 --> 37:14.596
looks like a perfect match
for the one used

37:14.630 --> 37:15.858
to pistol-Whip the victim.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.891
It's not too late
to cut a deal.

37:17.930 --> 37:19.625
We still don't know
which of your firm's lavwers

37:19.670 --> 37:21.638
ordered the hit on Tendu.

37:21.670 --> 37:22.830
You give us a name...

37:22.870 --> 37:24.508
I don't know
What you're talking about.

37:24.540 --> 37:27.031
Why would anyone from my firm
want me to kill some Eskimo?

37:27.070 --> 37:29.436
HOLMES:
Global warming.

37:29.480 --> 37:33.007
Your presence here is the result
of, uh, let's call it, um...

37:33.050 --> 37:34.745
"the reverse butterfly effect."

37:34.780 --> 37:36.748
You may be aware, the
actual butterfly effect

37:36.780 --> 37:41.479
is small, local events having
strikingly large consequences.

37:42.690 --> 37:44.783
A butterfly flaps
its Wings in the Congo

37:44.830 --> 37:46.786
and triggers a hurricane
in New York.

37:46.830 --> 37:48.525
That kind of thing.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.391
But the inverse is also true.

37:50.430 --> 37:53.763
Large-scale events can have
small, local consequences.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.792
For example, fossil fuel
emissions melt arctic ice,

37:56.840 --> 37:59.331
opening Canada's formerly
ice-clogged Northwest Passage

37:59.370 --> 38:00.928
to commercial shipping.

38:00.970 --> 38:03.530
Cargo companies can, uh, save
billions of dollars a year

38:03.580 --> 38:05.901
on fuel now by exploiting
this new, shorter route.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.339
But only if they can
secure land rights

38:08.380 --> 38:09.870
along the Northwest Passage

38:09.920 --> 38:11.148
for new ports.

38:11.180 --> 38:13.683
BELL: We understand your firm
was hired to secure those ports.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.551
If they pull it off,

38:15.590 --> 38:17.956
the partners stand to
make millions in commissions.

38:17.990 --> 38:19.719
HOLMES:
Unfortunately for them,

38:19.760 --> 38:21.694
the indigenous residents
of the Northwest Passage,

38:21.730 --> 38:24.426
specifically the villagers
of Maniitok,

38:24.470 --> 38:26.961
are loath to relinquish
their ancestral lands--

38:27.000 --> 38:29.093
a fact which
led to you

38:29.140 --> 38:31.529
being ordered to shoot
a young Inuit in the head.

38:33.610 --> 38:36.101
Now, you can either let this
butterfly-induced hurricane

38:36.140 --> 38:37.778
land entirely on you,

38:37.810 --> 38:40.370
or you can point us
to Whichever lawyer

38:40.410 --> 38:44.039
flapped his or her wings
and blew you to Tendu's door.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.584
Well, sorry to sound like a
broken record, but like I said,

38:51.630 --> 38:53.382
Raina's not great
at being on time.

38:53.430 --> 38:56.991
Well, actually, Raina's not
gonna be joining us today.

38:57.030 --> 38:59.624
We've been doing some digging,
Ms. Lundquist.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.365
It turns out
your work at

39:01.400 --> 39:03.539
the Animal Salvation Fund
is completely pro bono.

39:03.570 --> 39:06.459
Your day job is contract law
at Mather and Kline.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.808
According to this,
your current assignment is

39:08.840 --> 39:10.899
to secure port locations
along the Northwest Passage

39:10.940 --> 39:13.738
for a company called
Newhall Transocean.

39:13.780 --> 39:16.146
Now, if you manage to succeed,
you're in line to make partner.

39:16.180 --> 39:17.943
GREGSON: A partner
at a white-shoe firm

39:17.980 --> 39:20.687
like Mather and Kline makes
millions of dollars a year.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.551
WATSON:
But securing the ports

39:22.590 --> 39:23.852
hasn't been easy, has it?

39:23.890 --> 39:25.551
The locals are poor,

39:25.590 --> 39:27.558
and they're attached
to their traditions.

39:27.590 --> 39:29.797
So you volunteered
your legal services

39:29.830 --> 39:31.695
to an animal rights group
here in New York

39:31.730 --> 39:35.461
and managed to convince them
to pursue a ban on seal hunting.

39:35.500 --> 39:36.831
GREGSON: Ban like
that would've wrecked

39:36.870 --> 39:38.804
the locals' traditional
way of life.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.467
They would've been forced
to either relocate

39:40.510 --> 39:41.977
or seek new income.

39:42.010 --> 39:43.500
You were hoping
that they'd fold

39:43.540 --> 39:45.474
and agree to
Newhall's port deal.

39:45.510 --> 39:48.149
WATSON:
But Tendu Otolik's Sealfies

39:48.180 --> 39:50.614
turned public opinion
against the ban.

39:50.650 --> 39:52.481
So, when you switched to Plan B

39:52.520 --> 39:53.919
and tried to
buy the village outright,

39:53.950 --> 39:56.612
he stopped that, too.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.685
He sent money home
in exchange for a promise

39:58.730 --> 40:01.028
from the village elders to never
agree to Newhall's port.

40:01.060 --> 40:04.518
No way were you gonna
make partner after that.

40:04.570 --> 40:08.097
Not unless you could
make Tendu go away.

40:08.130 --> 40:10.928
Which brings us to
your fixer, Kurt Godwyn.

40:12.970 --> 40:14.608
No, no, you see...

40:14.640 --> 40:16.676
Save it.

40:16.710 --> 40:19.440
We've already got a full
confession from Mr. Goden.

40:19.480 --> 40:21.846
You might want
to call your firm.

40:21.880 --> 40:23.916
You're gonna need a good lawyer.

40:32.730 --> 40:33.924
Hey.

40:35.130 --> 40:36.893
Hey.

40:36.930 --> 40:40.024
I wanted you to know
that boy Lucien

40:40.070 --> 40:42.095
won't be bothering
you no more.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.700
Me and him,
we had a... talk.

40:44.740 --> 40:45.934
A talk?

40:45.970 --> 40:48.507
Sometimes that's all it takes.

40:50.910 --> 40:52.468
Chivonne?

40:54.720 --> 40:57.041
You won't have no_more
problems With him.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.240
I promise.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.838
Thanks.

41:04.630 --> 41:07.190
I liked walking you home
the other day.

41:07.230 --> 41:10.757
I was thinking maybe
we can make it a habit.

41:11.930 --> 41:13.568
Don't.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.965
Don't what?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.262
I know What you want.

41:16.300 --> 41:17.836
For you and me.

41:17.870 --> 41:19.235
But I can't do it.

41:19.270 --> 41:22.000
What you did doesn't
change things between us.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.769
It doesn't make us family.

41:23.810 --> 41:25.744
I came to you because I had to.

41:25.780 --> 41:27.202
Do you understand?

41:29.220 --> 41:31.518
I understand.

41:31.550 --> 41:34.110
You do what you need to do.

41:34.150 --> 41:36.152
*

41:41.830 --> 41:45.197
* I'm guilty

41:45.230 --> 41:46.219
* I'm guilty, yeah.
