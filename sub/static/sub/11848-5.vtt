Episode 5
"Chocolate"

01:28.000 --> 01:30.600
Have you ever been in love?

01:31.100 --> 01:33.700
I have been married for 17 years.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.499
That isn't what I said.

01:36.500 --> 01:40.400
Have you ever been in love?
Really in love?

01:41.100 --> 01:42.500
Sure!

01:44.300 --> 01:46.699
Not like I have.

01:46.700 --> 01:50.000
Oh, no.
You're special.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.400
I mean it.

01:55.300 --> 01:59.600
No man ever loved a woman
the way I loved her.

01:59.900 --> 02:03.600
I could see that by all that
blood splatter all over your shirt.

02:04.600 --> 02:08.900
Oh fine. You can call it murder.
Doesn't matter.

02:11.900 --> 02:14.800
Just back up a little bit here.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.800
I'm still not clear how
this little thing started.

02:19.200 --> 02:24.200
- How many times do I have to tell it?
- Till it start to sound like the truth!

02:25.300 --> 02:27.600
Just you and me, okay?

02:28.100 --> 02:30.500
Start from the beginning.

02:32.300 --> 02:35.399
I got up. I got dressed.
I went to work.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.700
Where do you work?

02:37.200 --> 02:40.600
Cougar Culinary Labs in Chicago.

02:40.700 --> 02:44.500
I create artificial flavors
for the food industry.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.500
Who put the magic rocks
in the water cooler?

02:53.100 --> 02:55.700
Jesus, Wally!
Chilli and cheese "Fritos"?

02:57.600 --> 03:01.300
You could be in a crowded stadium
and know who farted.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.599
Maybe you didn't know,
but the "Frito"

03:04.600 --> 03:06.400
is natures perfect food.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.300
Particularly the chilli
and cheese variety.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.300
Particular. Low in carbs.

03:14.300 --> 03:17.600
There is just no way to perfectly
synthesize honeydew melon. It's impossible.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.500
You've been combing that all week.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.599
Came close to 98, but the test rats
gave birth to two headed offspring.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.000
Legal thought that was a
considerable drawback.

03:28.100 --> 03:31.600
Not much call the artificial
honeydew melon, anyway?

03:32.300 --> 03:36.200
- It's a challenge!
- Yeah, challenge, "mellenge".
Give them cantaloupe!

03:41.000 --> 03:43.399
Who gonna eat that rabbit food?

03:43.400 --> 03:47.199
I have to eat this rabbit food.
If not I'll blow up like a weather balloon.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.600
Not me, man.

03:48.700 --> 03:52.900
I can eat till I puke. Never gain
an ounce. High metabolism as I know.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.400
Fuck you!

03:55.800 --> 03:59.599
So mister newly single,
be all that you can be.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.999
How's your love life?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.299
Well, me and my left hand
are going steady now.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.300
All newly fit and fabulous
and no place to go, huh?

04:07.400 --> 04:10.099
I just need a little time to...

04:10.100 --> 04:11.800
you know, think about stuff.

04:11.900 --> 04:14.799
Hey, my band is playing tonight.
Why don't you come?

04:14.800 --> 04:17.899
Who knows. You might meet
some rock & roll nymphomaniac!

04:18.600 --> 04:19.899
I don't think I'm ready for that.

04:19.899 --> 04:23.100
Well, come on, man. We're
bachelor, man. It will be great.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.900
I don't think so.
Not tonight.

04:25.901 --> 04:29.099
Come on...
Make it the last time I ever play.

04:29.100 --> 04:32.400
Ah bullshit. You will sharpening
guitar until the day you die.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.800
Don't be so sure.
I just turned 45 on Wednesday.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.899
Really? Happy Birthday!

04:37.900 --> 04:39.029
Ain't it heartbreaking?

04:39.030 --> 04:42.891
What's more depressing than a 45
year old failed rock and roller?

04:43.000 --> 04:48.500
Well, how about: Child support, alimony
and an empty downtown apartment?

04:49.600 --> 04:51.900
- Alright. You win!
- Yeah.

06:24.700 --> 06:27.600
I miss you, baby boy.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.899
Chocolate!

06:57.900 --> 07:00.208
I thought it was some kind
of wish fulfillment dream

07:00.209 --> 07:02.415
after all those weeks of rabbit food.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.999
But the taste was still
in my mouth when I woke up.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.300
And I could smell it too.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.699
It was really good stuff.
Custom...

07:11.700 --> 07:14.599
Bitter sweet with just
a hint of jasmine tea.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.599
Really special.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.099
So how did you know it wasn't a dream?

07:19.100 --> 07:21.100
It wasn't a dream.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.300
I just kept tasting
someone else's chocolate.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.900
Gesundheit!

07:57.400 --> 08:01.200
- You're wearing "Roswell" again?
- No reason not to.

08:03.700 --> 08:07.200
I just came by to check in
on you and Booth.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.200
Come on in.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.299
- Are you okay?
- I'm alright.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.900
You look nice.
You going out?

08:26.900 --> 08:28.900
Gesundheit!

08:31.000 --> 08:32.500
Is that a "hickey"?

08:33.400 --> 08:36.299
- Daddy...
- Hey...

08:36.900 --> 08:40.400
- Are you moving back home now?
- Daddy is just visiting.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.499
You said that you were just testing.

08:43.500 --> 08:47.300
I know, that was a long time ago.
See now, the test parts over.

08:47.400 --> 08:51.000
And lucky you.
You've got two places to stay now.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.700
Just like a rich movie star!

08:52.800 --> 08:57.300
Do rich movie stars have a mummy in
one house and a daddy in another one?

08:57.800 --> 09:00.500
Most of them. Come on, honey.
You better get ready for class.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.188
- Class?
- Dance class. Yuck!

09:04.600 --> 09:07.099
Look, Jamie. I'm really glad you
stopped by but we gonna go.

09:07.100 --> 09:10.500
Sure. Yeah, I understand.
Can't be late!

09:10.800 --> 09:12.320
Listen, chuckles!

09:12.321 --> 09:16.572
You wanna maybe get together, play some
ball, making go do some hiking weekend?

09:16.607 --> 09:19.600
- I want to say no dancing.
- No... No dancing.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.600
I'll see you Saturday, moose.
Here's your key.

09:22.800 --> 09:23.999
Listen.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.900
If I'm not up, you come in
and get me up, okay?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.900
Love monster hug!

09:34.400 --> 09:37.000
- Love you daddy.
- I love you too.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.600
- Sorry Nessie.
- No sorrys.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.300
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

10:10.100 --> 10:10.899
Hey!

10:10.900 --> 10:13.699
Jamie, you made it!
Did you get the table up front?

10:13.700 --> 10:14.700
Yeah.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.700
- Hey, man. You want some Vitamin C?
- No thanks. I'm on a diet.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.200
Got to lose weight.

10:20.300 --> 10:23.400
Hey Jamie, do that thing with the quarter.
Watch this, everybody. He's great!

10:23.500 --> 10:25.300
You boys, let's go!

10:25.301 --> 10:27.038
Shit!
Show time?

10:27.400 --> 10:28.799
Okay, everybody.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.399
Remember:
We are the chosen ones!

10:31.400 --> 10:34.800
The Gods of Rock and Roll!...

11:04.200 --> 11:06.900
So, do that thing with the quarter?

11:07.700 --> 11:09.799
Oh no... that's...

11:09.800 --> 11:13.000
It's just a magic trick.
It's... you know. It's silly.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.000
Come on. I want to see it.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.200
Alright.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.400
(I can't hear you!)

11:41.600 --> 11:43.200
(What's wrong with you?)

11:43.300 --> 11:46.200
(I can't hear anything!)

11:46.400 --> 11:47.700
(What's the matter?)

11:47.800 --> 11:50.700
(I can't hear anything at all! )

12:23.700 --> 12:25.800
You really kicked ass tonight.

12:26.600 --> 12:29.600
We were pretty fucking
awesome, weren't we?

12:29.800 --> 12:33.499
The next thing you know
is MTV, babes in bikinis...

12:33.500 --> 12:36.099
Low boy leather pants
with your bums hanging out.

12:36.100 --> 12:39.500
- Anna says I got cute bones!
- I never said you didn't.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.300
What was with the fake mohawk?

12:49.800 --> 12:53.800
Covers my hair transplant
scalp... what else?

13:34.700 --> 13:36.200
Oh, shit!

13:39.000 --> 13:40.399
Wally?

13:40.400 --> 13:41.899
What's the matter?

13:41.900 --> 13:43.700
I can't see!

13:44.600 --> 13:46.300
I can't see!

13:46.700 --> 13:49.000
- What are you doing?
- I can't see!

13:49.600 --> 13:51.500
What are you doing! What
the fuck are you talking about?

13:51.600 --> 13:54.000
- Grab the fucking wheel!
- What the fuck!

14:08.600 --> 14:10.500
Wally?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.100
Wally, are you okay?

14:17.600 --> 14:20.153
It's fucking great!

14:53.000 --> 14:54.600
Who is there?

16:31.300 --> 16:33.100
Did I wake you?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.900
I do not know how
they can do it either?

17:18.300 --> 17:19.299
What's that?

17:19.300 --> 17:21.898
What I mean it is so easy
to eat food that is good for you.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.398
It even taste better.

17:23.400 --> 17:27.699
But they raise their kids on
chocotrees and *** tops so...

17:27.700 --> 17:29.699
that's what they like!

17:29.700 --> 17:34.599
Right, yeah... it's sausages and eggs
and hash brown for breakfast.

17:34.600 --> 17:38.499
Chilli dogs and cheeseburgers,
batted fries for lunch...

17:38.500 --> 17:41.699
and then deep fried chicken fingers
and macaroni and cheese

17:41.700 --> 17:43.600
for dinner with a
big bowl of ice cream.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.300
You know what else is just terrible?

17:48.500 --> 17:51.199
Mile high chocolate cake.

17:51.200 --> 17:55.899
Oh and double cheese pizza with
pepperoni and sausage. Yuck!

17:55.900 --> 17:58.512
And double chocolate
chunk cookies, still warm,

17:58.513 --> 18:01.489
so chocolate gets over
your fingers. Just awful!

18:01.500 --> 18:02.900
Yeah!

18:03.900 --> 18:07.200
So... how long have you been dieting?

18:07.900 --> 18:09.499
For God's sake, why?

18:09.500 --> 18:12.500
Ninety six days.
Hyperglycemia.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.800
I'm a pain for too many
years with double desserts.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.799
How about you?

18:20.800 --> 18:23.100
Forty-seven days.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.900
Vanity. There I said it loud.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.700
So you want to celebrate?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.200
So how do you feel?
How is your hyperglycemia?

18:46.300 --> 18:47.800
I feel great.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.999
You cured me.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.500
No. I think you cured me.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.999
Are you married?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.900
The white slit on your ring finger.

19:17.400 --> 19:21.500
No, I was. But the divorce
was final a few months ago.

19:23.700 --> 19:26.500
- I'm sorry.
- No. It's okay.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.500
Seven years of a monotonous
relationship. At least I'm safe.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.500
Really?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.600
For what?

20:01.600 --> 20:04.000
It's easy to be with you.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.200
What?
What is it?

20:13.700 --> 20:16.100
You get a sharp pain?

20:16.600 --> 20:19.000
I think I'll be okay in a minute.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.200
See if this helps.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.600
Guess that's what
I get for pinging out.

20:53.300 --> 20:56.000
Let's go to sleep.

21:02.900 --> 21:05.000
It's so weird!

21:29.700 --> 21:32.000
Can you wake up?

21:37.400 --> 21:39.300
It's happening!

21:40.300 --> 21:42.100
What's happening?

21:46.300 --> 21:49.600
How can anybody
look so good so early?

22:14.200 --> 22:18.700
God!
You're so fucking beautiful!

22:26.900 --> 22:28.700
Jamie? What is it?

22:32.200 --> 22:33.600
What's wrong?

22:40.600 --> 22:42.400
Jamie, stop it!

22:43.100 --> 22:45.200
Please. Just stop!

22:51.700 --> 22:55.000
Stop it! Stop it!
This isn't funny!

22:55.400 --> 22:58.600
Jamie? You're scaring me.
Stop it!

23:05.200 --> 23:06.700
Jamie?

23:07.500 --> 23:09.700
Jamie, someone at the front door.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.200
Jamie?

23:18.100 --> 23:19.300
Please, get up!

23:21.800 --> 23:23.199
Jamie? Somebody's coming!

23:23.200 --> 23:25.300
Rise and shine, Daddy!

23:26.900 --> 23:28.200
Oh my God!

23:28.400 --> 23:31.500
- Hey! Your family is here!
- It's not funny! Stop it!

23:31.600 --> 23:34.299
- What's the matter, daddy?
- Jamie, stop it!

23:34.300 --> 23:35.599
Leave my daddy alone.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.800
- Leave him alone.
I didn't do anything!

23:38.500 --> 23:40.800
I didn't do anything!

23:41.400 --> 23:43.600
Damn you, Jamie.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.500
It's a woman?

24:06.600 --> 24:08.000
Elaine?

25:01.800 --> 25:03.699
I love you.

25:03.700 --> 25:08.700
Those three words were suddenly
so potent and meaningful to me.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.899
Up until then,

25:10.900 --> 25:15.200
I didn't realized that you could
feel with your heart and your gut.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.900
It felt it so new and deep,
and good.

25:21.300 --> 25:26.200
Until that moment I didn't realized
how shallow my life had been.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.600
And it...

25:29.000 --> 25:31.600
Well, it humiliated me...

25:32.600 --> 25:34.600
It felt like...

25:35.700 --> 25:37.800
like growing up.

26:02.100 --> 26:04.800
No! Please don't go.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.400
You okay?

26:45.100 --> 26:47.300
Come back to me.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.000
Jesus!

28:49.300 --> 28:52.000
Wally, something really
weird is happening to me.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.100
You really been weird!

28:55.600 --> 28:57.200
You know, these...

28:57.500 --> 29:00.700
- These "spells" I've been having.
- Yeah, they getting worse?

29:02.300 --> 29:04.100
Well, it's...

29:04.800 --> 29:07.100
It's a woman.

29:09.400 --> 29:13.300
Excellent. Jamie,
congratulations! That's great!

29:14.200 --> 29:16.300
What's she like?

29:16.500 --> 29:19.400
She is the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.699
You got it bad.

29:23.700 --> 29:26.500
It isn't what you think.
It's like um...

29:28.600 --> 29:33.000
It's like I'm receiving
transmissions from somebody.

29:33.300 --> 29:35.399
What do you mean?
Like possessed!

29:35.400 --> 29:36.800
No.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.700
There is this woman...
I don't know who she is or where she is...

29:44.500 --> 29:48.599
But... I can see what she sees.

29:48.600 --> 29:52.099
I hear what she hears.
I can feel what she feels.

29:52.100 --> 29:55.200
- Then, what did she feel?
- Wally, I'm serious.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.500
Okay.

30:03.100 --> 30:05.400
How do you know it's a woman?

30:05.800 --> 30:07.900
Last night,

30:08.100 --> 30:10.299
the woman...

30:10.300 --> 30:13.000
she had sex...

30:14.700 --> 30:16.600
And I felt it!

30:16.900 --> 30:21.399
- Wow. You felt her... get fucked?
- Wally, I'm not crazy!

30:21.400 --> 30:23.500
This is for real.

30:29.100 --> 30:31.700
Never mind.
Forget it.

30:32.800 --> 30:36.100
Listen.
The twins are visiting my folks.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.800
So Anna wanted me
to invite you for dinner.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.900
I can't come tonight.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.600
Because of this girl.

30:44.400 --> 30:48.399
- Who you only met in your dreams.
- They are not dreams!

30:48.400 --> 30:52.099
Okay well, if you're
having hallucinations,

30:52.100 --> 30:53.795
don't you think you ought go
to see a doctor or something?

30:53.796 --> 30:56.271
What makes you think
I want it to stop?

30:58.700 --> 31:01.341
This woman...
I think she's calling me.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.800
I think maybe she needs me.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.700
Look what I got for us.

33:08.300 --> 33:09.600
Oh yeah...

33:11.200 --> 33:12.700
Come on.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.600
Get in with us.

33:18.600 --> 33:21.100
Doesn't she have a beautiful face?

33:24.300 --> 33:26.300
Look.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.700
Kiss her.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.700
You bitch!

33:51.200 --> 33:53.400
Who do you think you are?

33:58.300 --> 34:00.000
Leave her alone!

34:20.199 --> 34:21.500
What?

34:48.699 --> 34:53.300
I could feel his blood running all
down my arms, hot and sticky.

34:54.500 --> 34:59.299
I just felt so sick and filthy...

34:59.300 --> 35:02.099
and... I don't know.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.299
Depraved... like a murderer.

35:05.300 --> 35:09.900
I felt so empty and sick,
and scared inside.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.300
I just didn't know
how to feel anymore.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.999
And then all the visions
just... stopped.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.500
Everything went dead.

35:22.300 --> 35:24.300
I was in love with her.

35:24.900 --> 35:27.600
But this had me all fucked up.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.400
It's a coast.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.100
No.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.500
The West coast.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.700
The West Coast!

36:37.100 --> 36:39.163
No...
Oregon.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.900
Washington.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.500
West Coast... West Coast...

36:50.800 --> 36:53.300
Canada!

37:06.900 --> 37:08.600
That's it!

37:09.600 --> 37:12.499
You set off to Vancouver because
of a piece of a license plate?

37:12.500 --> 37:14.800
I just knew I had to find her.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.100
What do you expect to do
once you found her?

37:19.800 --> 37:22.699
I don't know...
I loved her.

37:22.700 --> 37:24.900
A murderer...

37:25.600 --> 37:28.799
Maybe it was just a dream we shared.

37:28.800 --> 37:31.100
Maybe it was self defense.

37:31.800 --> 37:35.100
I don't know, but I hope so.

38:04.300 --> 38:05.800
Sorry!

38:12.000 --> 38:13.899
Local artist found dead in studio.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.100
"Police Access Scene of Violent homicide."

38:18.300 --> 38:20.500
Want to buy your own?

39:00.900 --> 39:02.700
Plaisirs de Chocolat
FINE HANDMADE CHOCOLATES

40:12.800 --> 40:15.200
CRIME SCENE

41:14.600 --> 41:19.177
SQM-329!

42:23.700 --> 42:25.800
Just a minute!

42:28.200 --> 42:30.599
Sorry. I was in the shower.

42:30.600 --> 42:33.400
- Yes?
- Catherine Duprees?

42:34.100 --> 42:36.100
Yes.

42:36.300 --> 42:38.400
Do you know me?

42:40.200 --> 42:42.100
Ever met?

42:42.600 --> 42:45.600
Sorry.
No, I guess not.

42:46.300 --> 42:49.900
- I have a delivery for you.
- Really? What is it?

43:03.100 --> 43:04.600
Asshole!

43:05.200 --> 43:08.100
This reminds her of him.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.699
Why are you following me?

44:31.700 --> 44:34.500
- I'm not following you.
- Do you think I'm an imbecile?

44:34.600 --> 44:36.600
What do you want?

44:38.100 --> 44:40.499
I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

44:40.500 --> 44:42.700
Tell me why you brought
me those chocolates.

44:43.900 --> 44:46.499
I thought you'd like them.

44:46.500 --> 44:50.200
- And I needed to meet you.
- How do you know me?

44:50.700 --> 44:53.000
I saw you sketching at the zoo.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.200
A cougar.

44:55.900 --> 44:58.799
I'm a fan.
I really like your work.

44:58.800 --> 45:01.099
Then why didn't you just
come up and say hello?

45:01.100 --> 45:04.999
Why are you following me. I could call the
policeman and have you thrown in jail.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.399
I know... I'm really sorry.
I was stupid.

45:08.400 --> 45:11.799
- I just... I had to meet you.
- Well...

45:11.800 --> 45:15.399
- We have met.
- Yes. I like your paintings very much.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.999
- I think you're very talented.
- Thank you for telling me that.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.199
Look. I'm not one of those creeps
that follows beautiful women around

45:22.200 --> 45:24.700
and drives them crazy.
I'm not a stalker.

45:25.100 --> 45:29.200
I know I've made a mistake.
I'm really very, very sorry.

45:30.900 --> 45:33.900
I realize I make a
lousy first impression.

45:34.100 --> 45:36.099
Could I just talk with you?

45:36.100 --> 45:38.900
Lunch, some place nice.
Your choice.

45:39.400 --> 45:42.399
I'm glad you like my work, but I
don't think it would be a good idea.

45:42.400 --> 45:44.999
No please!
We need to talk.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.199
No! You need to talk.
I don't.

45:47.200 --> 45:49.900
Listen. I've came a
very long way to find you.

45:51.300 --> 45:54.399
Just lunch... a public place.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.399
My life is complicated
enough right now.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.700
- I know.
- What do you know?

45:59.000 --> 46:02.399
I mean, everybody's life
is complicated. Mine too.

46:02.400 --> 46:06.200
Why me? Why don't you go stalk
some movie star out somewhere?

46:08.200 --> 46:09.999
I know how special you are.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.500
- You don't know anything about me.
- Yes, I do.

46:12.700 --> 46:15.400
I know you wish I'd leave you alone.

46:16.300 --> 46:19.100
Look. I know how you feel
I don't blame you at all.

46:19.800 --> 46:23.900
And I promise I'll leave you alone and never
bother you again, if that's what you want.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.100
Just... let me take you to lunch first.

46:28.200 --> 46:30.100
Just once.

46:32.100 --> 46:34.300
Now you're right about one thing.

46:35.200 --> 46:38.200
You make a terrible first impression.

46:45.200 --> 46:50.000
You're just gonna keep staring at me?
Is that why you're following me around?

46:53.800 --> 46:56.700
I have to talk to you about something.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.600
What?

47:00.200 --> 47:03.300
I have to tell you the reason...

47:04.900 --> 47:07.600
why I love you.

47:08.300 --> 47:11.600
- What?
- I can't say it again.

47:12.900 --> 47:15.400
I know you better than you think.

47:16.100 --> 47:18.200
How long have you been spying on me?

47:18.300 --> 47:21.000
It's not what you're thinking, please.

47:21.200 --> 47:24.500
- Don't be afraid of me.
- I'm not afraid of you.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.900
Sometimes...

47:31.000 --> 47:33.499
I'm inside you.

47:33.500 --> 47:35.700
No! Please!
Listen to me.

47:35.900 --> 47:38.499
I'm not crazy.
I'm not a pervert.

47:38.500 --> 47:41.100
I'm on your side.
Trust me.

47:48.500 --> 47:50.799
Sometimes...

47:50.800 --> 47:54.699
I can feel what you feel.
I can smell what you smelling.

47:54.700 --> 47:57.999
I can even see what you see.
I can't control it.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.300
It just happens.

47:59.400 --> 48:02.057
I know I sound like
a lunatic, but it's true.

48:02.058 --> 48:05.028
It started when
I tasted the chocolate.

48:05.300 --> 48:09.900
And I thought it was a dream, but then
the park... with your paintings...

48:11.900 --> 48:17.300
For some reason, I got to know
you better than anybody knows you.

48:17.600 --> 48:20.800
Somehow, we're psychically linked.

48:21.200 --> 48:26.900
And I was hoping that
maybe you could feel me.

48:32.600 --> 48:34.900
I'd like to go home.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.900
I really rather be alone right now.

48:46.700 --> 48:49.021
Please just...
Please let me walk you to your door.

48:49.022 --> 48:51.534
Just leave me alone.

48:56.100 --> 48:58.200
Okay.

48:59.300 --> 49:01.400
I'm sorry.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.300
I understand.

49:12.400 --> 49:14.000
Quiet!
Quiet!

49:14.001 --> 49:17.200
There were cops.
You can't go home now.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.100
You have to trust me.

49:21.700 --> 49:23.700
What do you know about me?

49:24.700 --> 49:27.000
I know you had to do it.

49:27.300 --> 49:29.300
Let me help you.

49:33.200 --> 49:36.200
Out of millions of people, why you?

49:36.300 --> 49:39.700
You think I don't spent every
minute thinking about that?

49:40.500 --> 49:43.600
At first I thought it was
the chemicals at work.

49:43.800 --> 49:47.000
Or maybe it was her art
that brought us together.

49:47.900 --> 49:51.899
Or maybe it was just
that I was so empty.

49:51.900 --> 49:54.300
And she was so full.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.799
What do you want from me?

49:58.800 --> 50:00.900
Money?

50:02.300 --> 50:04.400
Sex?

50:05.300 --> 50:07.999
Everything I've told you,

50:08.000 --> 50:11.299
everything I will ever
tell you is the truth.

50:11.300 --> 50:14.800
I'll never lie to you.
I want to help you.

50:15.100 --> 50:17.400
Even knowing what I've done?

50:34.300 --> 50:37.000
I'm scared...

50:40.400 --> 50:43.200
I won't let anything happen to you.

50:54.800 --> 50:57.699
Will you take me home?

50:57.700 --> 50:59.899
Do you trust me?

50:59.900 --> 51:02.400
I have to.

52:00.400 --> 52:02.500
Come on in.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.400
Everything is gonna be okay.

52:20.900 --> 52:23.200
I love you.

52:25.300 --> 52:27.600
I know.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.900
Jamie.

52:33.500 --> 52:37.099
I did feel things.

52:37.100 --> 52:40.100
See things...

52:41.100 --> 52:45.400
I didn't know what it was...
I thought I was going crazy.

52:45.900 --> 52:48.700
No, Catherine.
You're not crazy.

52:49.700 --> 52:52.000
What did you see?
What did you feel?

52:52.001 --> 52:53.553
I don't know.

52:55.200 --> 52:58.600
Images... flavors...

53:00.500 --> 53:03.200
Faces...

53:05.400 --> 53:08.400
Loneliness.

53:13.500 --> 53:16.400
You're shivering.

53:23.500 --> 53:26.000
I could use something to drink.

53:26.100 --> 53:29.200
- Would you like something?
- Sure.

53:42.200 --> 53:44.800
I'm glad you're here with me.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.300
So am I.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.700
It's bitter!

54:42.800 --> 54:44.300
What?

54:45.700 --> 54:48.300
Just feel a little dizzy.

54:59.200 --> 55:02.800
What do you want! How long
have you been watching me?

55:03.100 --> 55:04.396
What are you waiting for?

55:04.397 --> 55:06.947
Why don't you just throw me
in the cell and get it over with?

55:07.200 --> 55:08.899
Don't you just want to fuck me?

55:08.900 --> 55:11.700
I'm not a cop and I'm not
trying to blackmail you.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.499
I love you!

55:14.500 --> 55:16.200
Do you?

55:16.700 --> 55:19.101
Could you feel it?
The knife.

55:19.102 --> 55:21.238
Could you feel it
plunging into his flesh?

55:21.900 --> 55:24.399
Did you feel him jerking and fighting?

55:24.400 --> 55:27.100
Could you feel the blood
running down your arms?

55:28.100 --> 55:30.300
Is that what made you love me?

56:06.400 --> 56:08.600
Catherine, no!

56:21.400 --> 56:23.799
I don't want to hurt you.

56:23.800 --> 56:26.099
You should have never come here.

56:26.100 --> 56:28.499
Catherine, please don't do this.

56:28.500 --> 56:31.699
- I only want to help you.
- You don't even know me.

56:31.700 --> 56:34.900
Catherine, no!
Don't make me do this...

56:36.100 --> 56:37.800
Catherine, please!

56:44.400 --> 56:46.100
Oh Jesus!

56:49.700 --> 56:51.600
Not now!

56:57.800 --> 57:00.500
It's happening now, isn't it?

57:02.500 --> 57:04.800
What do you see?

57:12.100 --> 57:14.400
You can't see me, can you?

57:16.600 --> 57:17.900
Catherine!

57:38.200 --> 57:41.500
And I knew what it felt like to die.

57:48.300 --> 57:51.500
You know that's not
an easy story to swallow.

57:52.600 --> 57:55.400
I can't do anything about that.

58:02.400 --> 58:04.600
Get him on the ambulance.
