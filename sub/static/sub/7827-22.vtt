We don't think you're slow,

it's not like you go to museums

02:17.637 --> 02:19.097
You think I don't want to?

02:19.180 --> 02:22.809
It's those TV networks, Marge.

-Oh, Homey.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.165
If you feel so bad

there's always things

02:49.085 --> 02:50.420
There's that.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.173
Or you could take
an adult education course.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.842
Oh, and how is "education"

02:55.925 --> 02:57.802
supposed to make
me feel smarter?

02:57.886 --> 03:00.430
Besides, every time I learn
something new,

03:00.513 --> 03:02.640
it pushes some old stuff
out of my brain.

03:02.724 --> 03:06.436
Remember when I took that home wine-making
course and I forgot how to drive?

03:06.519 --> 03:07.937
That's because
you were drunk!

03:08.021 --> 03:09.606
And how.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.659
One way to drive

03:21.743 --> 03:24.871
is to wear tight,

what I had to say.

10:32.715 --> 10:33.841
Mmm. I'm happy about that.

10:33.924 --> 10:35.926
But I think you
can be a good teacher

10:36.010 --> 10:37.845
and still respect our privacy.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.722
Look, Marge.
You don't know what it's like.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.891
I'm the one out there every day
putting his ass on the line.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.935
And I'm not out of order.
You're out of order!

10:45.019 --> 10:47.647
The whole freakin' system
is out of order.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.857
You want the truth?
You want the truth?

10:49.940 --> 10:52.234
You can't handle the truth!

10:52.318 --> 10:56.072
'Cause when you reach over
and put your hand into a pile of goo

10:56.155 --> 10:59.909
that was your best friend's face,
you'll know what to do!

10:59.992 --> 11:03.704
Forget it, Marge.
It's Chinatown!

11:03.788 --> 11:06.916
Homer, don't ever tell them
personal stuff about me again!

11:06.999 --> 11:08.084
(quietly) Yes, ma'am.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.752
Now, what is a wedding?

11:09.835 --> 11:13.089
Well, Webster's Dictionary
describes a wedding as

11:13.172 --> 11:16.676
"The process of removing
weeds from one's garden."

11:16.759 --> 11:18.469
(all groan)

11:18.552 --> 11:20.596
Tell us more
about you and Marge.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.432
This is a place of learning,
not a house of...

11:23.516 --> 11:24.975
hearing about things.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.770
-(students groan)
-Guess he's run out of stories.

11:27.853 --> 11:28.688
What a rip-off.

11:28.771 --> 11:32.733
I can't believe I paid $10,000
for this course.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.069
What the heck
was that lab fee for?

11:35.152 --> 11:36.904
No. Wait. Uh, um--

11:36.987 --> 11:39.156
Wait. I-- Yes.
(clears throat)

11:39.240 --> 11:42.952
I do have a story about
two other young marrieds.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.122
(students murmuring)

11:46.205 --> 11:50.876
Now, the wife of this couple
has an interesting quirk in the bedroom.

11:50.960 --> 11:55.756
It seems she goes wild with desire
if her husband nibbles on her elbow.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.843
-We need names!
-Well, let's just call 'em, uh,

11:58.926 --> 12:02.722
Mr. "X" And Mrs. "Y."

12:02.805 --> 12:04.473
So, anyway, Mr. "X" would say,

12:04.557 --> 12:07.560
"Marge, if this doesn't
get your motor running,

12:07.643 --> 12:09.812
my name isn't
Homer J. Simpson ."

12:09.895 --> 12:10.771
(all gasping, murmuring)

12:14.734 --> 12:15.735
-Huh?
-Ooh, Homer.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.278
Don't you have to get to class?

12:17.361 --> 12:18.946
Not tonight, Marge.

12:19.029 --> 12:22.408
Tonight we can eat a nice,
leisurely dinner at home.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.326
Oh. Well, that will be l--
(gasps)

12:26.579 --> 12:28.122
What the darn?

12:28.205 --> 12:29.790
Marge, you'll
never guess what.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.500
My whole class is here.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.419
They're going to observe
the human peep show

12:33.502 --> 12:35.546
that is our lives.

12:35.629 --> 12:39.341
Apparently, that disturbing odor
was the food.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.929
So, little Lisa,
apple of my eye,

12:44.013 --> 12:46.974
how are things down
at the old schoolhouse?

12:47.057 --> 12:50.728
I find this demeaning and embarrassing
beyond my worst nightmares.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.855
(chuckling)

12:52.938 --> 12:54.815
And how's my little
major leaguer?

12:54.899 --> 12:57.234
Catch any june bugs today?

12:57.318 --> 12:59.320
Well, me and Milhouse took
some mail from a mail truck

12:59.403 --> 13:00.613
and threw it down the sewer.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.865
Son, I know you meant well,

13:02.948 --> 13:05.201
but that wasn't
the right thing to do.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.744
What the hell are you
talkin' about?

13:06.827 --> 13:08.245
You're the one
who double-dared us.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.455
Why, you little--

13:09.538 --> 13:10.498
-(choking)
-CLASS: Ooh.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.499
Homer!

13:11.582 --> 13:13.417
-I'm outta here.
-Me too.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.127
(students murmuring quietly)

13:15.211 --> 13:17.797
(forced laughing)

13:17.880 --> 13:21.008
Well, now that the little ones
have toddled off to bed--

13:21.091 --> 13:24.553
I want this to end now.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.807
Hey, Homer.
Why don't you just nibble her elbow?

13:27.890 --> 13:31.018
That always melts her butter, right?
Heh, heh, heh.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.102
(gasps)

13:32.186 --> 13:33.521
All right.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.773
Okay.
Everybody out!

13:35.856 --> 13:38.025
Ooh,
she's gotta have it.

13:38.108 --> 13:42.488
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
Get out-out-out-out-out-out-out!

13:42.571 --> 13:44.281
All right, we're breaking early
tonight, class.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.450
For tomorrow, you should read
pages seven through 18

13:46.534 --> 13:47.451
in Lisa's diary.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.619
-You too.
-Huh?

13:48.702 --> 13:49.662
Get out!

13:49.745 --> 13:50.579
But I'm not
in the cla--

13:53.916 --> 13:55.626
Is any of this gonna
be on the test?

13:55.709 --> 13:57.711
'Cause I wasn't
payin' attention.

14:04.009 --> 14:08.764
Come on, Marge. Let me in!
There's crickets out here.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.395
Okay, Marge. Things were said.
Mistakes were made.

14:14.478 --> 14:17.648
Let's end this madness
and get on with our lives.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.900
You just don't get it,
do you, Homer?

14:19.984 --> 14:22.444
You told personal things
about our lives,

14:22.528 --> 14:24.154
even after
you promised you wouldn't.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.658
-I can't trust you anymore.
-But I learned my lesson.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.410
It'll never happen again.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.829
Hey, Homer.
What's the big brouhaha-ha?

14:31.912 --> 14:33.622
Ah, Marge is throwin' me out

14:33.706 --> 14:35.457
-for blabbin' about her elbow thing.
-(groans)

14:36.584 --> 14:38.460
Honey, the door blew shut.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.714
Oh. Fine.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.133
If that's what you want,
you've got it.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.761
This scene is gettin' old, man.
I'm hittin' the road.

14:47.845 --> 14:51.265
Maybe I'll drop you a line
someday from wherever I wind up

14:51.348 --> 14:53.267
in this crazy old world.

14:56.604 --> 15:01.525
Kids, your father and I are going
through a really tough time right now,

15:01.609 --> 15:03.819
and I don't know
what's going to happen.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.781
But just remember that both your mom
and your dad love you very, very much.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.286
Wow, I've never seen Mom
so mad at Homer before.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.121
I'll tell you
a secret, Bart.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.998
Every time I'm worried
about Mom and Dad,

15:16.081 --> 15:18.792
I go to the attic and add
to my ball of string.

15:20.878 --> 15:21.795
(screeches)

15:24.173 --> 15:26.425
Earth base, this is
commander Bart McCool.

15:26.508 --> 15:28.719
We are under attack by
the Zorrinid brain changers.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.388
Quickly, into
the safety dome, Milbot.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.223
(in monotone)
Affirmative, humanoid.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.560
BOTH: Ew!

15:36.644 --> 15:38.729
Don't mind me, boys.
Just scrubbin' my undies.

15:38.812 --> 15:42.316
Sorry, Bart.
Your dad kinda blew the fantasy.

15:42.399 --> 15:45.527
I only like it
when I'm pretend-scared.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.987
Keep up the roughhousing, son.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.740
Without a strong male
presence in the house,

15:49.823 --> 15:51.742
you could turn
sissy overnight.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.203
Oh, these stubborn
grass stains.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.083
Oh, good.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.834
Reverend Lovejoy will
make Marge take me back.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.045
He has to push
the sanctity of marriage,

16:03.128 --> 16:05.547
or his god will punish him.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.591
-Get a divorce.
-Mm-hmm.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.134
But isn't that a sin?

16:09.218 --> 16:11.595
Marge, just about
everything is a sin.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.931
You ever sat down
and read this thing?

16:14.014 --> 16:16.183
Technically, we're not
allowed to go to the bathroom.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.354
(sighs)

16:20.437 --> 16:22.147
(moans softly)

16:22.231 --> 16:24.566
Good night, Marge.
(kisses)

16:26.026 --> 16:28.278
Oh, why didn't I take
a picture?

16:28.362 --> 16:30.614
I had ten years
to take a picture.

16:30.698 --> 16:34.785
Hmm. Funny the way everything
reminds me of Homer.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.089
HOMER'S VOICE:
I love you.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.800
Will you marry me, Marge?

16:49.883 --> 16:52.177
You mean,
I'm gonna be a daddy?

16:52.261 --> 16:57.224
I hope we'll always be
together, together, together--

16:57.307 --> 16:59.018
-Together?
-(tires screech)

16:59.101 --> 17:00.561
(screams, grunting)
Ooh.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.485
Here, Dad. I brought you some nice--
(yelps)

17:08.569 --> 17:11.822
Good news, Lisa. I don't need
your mother anymore.

17:11.905 --> 17:16.243
I've created a replacement that's
superior to her in almost every way.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.704
Dad, that's just a plant.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.040
Lisa! You will respect
your new mother.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.124
Now, give her a kiss.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.585
Kiss her!
(yelps)

17:26.128 --> 17:28.881
Oh-my-God! Oh-my-God!
Oh-my-God! (panting)

17:28.964 --> 17:30.716
All right.
Let's get our stories straight.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.510
She tripped, right?

17:33.594 --> 17:36.263
Look. I brought you
some nice pudding.

17:36.346 --> 17:40.517
Ah, your flesh mother
used to bring me pudding.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.561
Oh, I miss Marge.

17:42.644 --> 17:46.065
Lisa, you're smart.
Help me trick her into taking me back.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.484
Dad, you can't trick somebody
into loving you.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.737
There's a reason two people
come together and stay together.

17:51.820 --> 17:52.863
There's something
they give each other

17:52.946 --> 17:54.615
that nobody else can give them.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.575
If you want to get Mom back,
you just have to remember

17:56.658 --> 17:59.036
what you give her
that nobody else can.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.997
I'll pay you $40
if you think of it for me.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.249
-No.
-Okay. 30.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.628
Good luck, Dad.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.047
All right, brain.
It's all up to you.

18:10.130 --> 18:13.133
If you don't think of what it is,
we'll lose Marge forever.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.968
<i>Eat the pudding. Eat the pudding.</i>
<i>Eat the pudding.</i>

18:15.052 --> 18:16.220
<i>Eat the pudding.</i>
<i>Eat the pudding. Eat the pudding.</i>

18:16.303 --> 18:17.387
<i>Eat the pudding.</i>
<i>Eat the pudding.</i>

18:17.471 --> 18:20.516
Okay, but then
we gotta get to work.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.726
(eating loudly)

18:22.810 --> 18:24.812
(moans softly)

18:26.939 --> 18:28.190
(doorbell chimes)

18:28.273 --> 18:30.109
(exhales)

18:30.192 --> 18:32.236
(clears throat)
Oh. H-hi, Marge.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.113
I heard you and Homer broke up,

18:34.196 --> 18:37.950
so I'm declarin' my intentions
to move in on his territory.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.536
Here, I, uh,
brung ya some posies.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.329
Oh, my.

18:42.412 --> 18:46.416
I'm very flattered, but
I'm not really interested.

18:46.500 --> 18:50.504
Sheesh. I come here,
I get dressed up all nice-like,

18:50.587 --> 18:55.259
put my heart on the line,
and I make a fool of myself.

18:55.342 --> 18:58.804
Oh, boy. Oh, I'm gonna
start bawlin' here.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.640
Hmm, why don't you come inside
for a drink of water?

19:01.723 --> 19:02.975
'Kay.

19:06.854 --> 19:10.274
Hmm. Clean house,
no silverfish.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.109
Could've been very happy here.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.652
(knocking)

19:13.735 --> 19:14.987
-Homer.
-Moe.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.074
-What are you doin' here?
-I, um-- Well, I--

19:19.158 --> 19:20.242
I never touched her, Homer.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.368
Homer, I swear,
I never touched her.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.995
MARGE:
Here's your water, Moe.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.037
I didn't ask her
for no water.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.205
She's lyin', Homer,
she's lyin'.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.707
She told me you were dead.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.793
That's the only reason I--
I didn't do nothin'!

19:29.877 --> 19:31.170
(glass breaking, Moe shouts)

19:31.253 --> 19:32.296
Bye, Moe.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.381
Homer,
what happened to you?

19:34.464 --> 19:38.135
Marge, I figured out what
I can give you that no one else can:

19:38.218 --> 19:41.805
A bouquet of po-- Ohhh.

19:41.889 --> 19:45.350
I give up. I don't deserve
to live with you.

19:48.645 --> 19:52.566
-Hmm.
-(table bumps against wall)

19:52.649 --> 19:55.903
Oh. My tattered rags

19:55.986 --> 19:58.822
are caught on
your coffee table.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.325
Oh, here.
Let me help you.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.248
(muttering softy)

20:08.332 --> 20:10.167
Wait a minute.
Wait, that's it.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.212
I know now what I can offer you
that no one else can:

20:13.295 --> 20:16.423
Complete and utter dependence.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.634
Homer, that's not a good thing.

20:18.717 --> 20:22.429
Are you kidding?
It's a wondrous, marvelous thing.

20:22.512 --> 20:26.433
Marge, I need you more than
anyone else on this entire planet

20:26.516 --> 20:28.393
could possibly
ever need you.

20:28.477 --> 20:31.813
I need you to take care of me,
to put up with me

20:31.897 --> 20:34.191
and most of all,
I need you to love me,

20:34.274 --> 20:35.859
because I love you.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.903
(sad grunt)

20:37.986 --> 20:40.656
But how do I know
I can trust you?

20:40.739 --> 20:43.450
Marge, look at me.
We've been separated for a day,

20:43.533 --> 20:45.702
and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.246
In another few hours
I'll be dead.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.957
I can't afford
to lose your trust again.

21:03.428 --> 21:08.058
I must admit,
you really do make a gal feel needed.

21:08.141 --> 21:10.018
Wait till my class
hears about this.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.770
Kidding!

21:11.853 --> 21:16.650
(sighs) Oh, it's great to be
indoors with my family.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.652
I'm really glad
you're back, Dad.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.112
I knew you could do it.

21:20.195 --> 21:22.864
Now don't screw it up.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.533
Look, Dad.
I missed you so much,

21:24.616 --> 21:27.244
I couldn't concentrate in
school and I got an "F."

21:27.327 --> 21:29.454
Hey, this is dated
two weeks ago.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.873
Oh. Sorry.
Here's a fresh one.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.584
And I have a special
present for you,

21:34.668 --> 21:37.087
but I'll give it
to you later tonight.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.840
Special present? I don't
wanna wait. I want it now!

21:39.923 --> 21:42.009
I want the children to see.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.136
Ooh.
Oh, right.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.847
Later.
(chuckling)

21:46.930 --> 21:49.433
So, Marge, are you
really happy? Really?

21:49.516 --> 21:50.892
-Hey, Moe.
