00:01.502 --> 00:03.671
Lady Luck
is on your side
from LA to Vegas.

00:03.704 --> 00:06.907
What, are you gonna put
a sock on the cockpit door?
Don't cockpit-block me.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.342
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.046
The Mick, The Last Man on Earth,

00:12.080 --> 00:13.247
and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.582
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.487
-Uh-uh.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.722
-Uh-uh.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.991
-And this... Oh, yep. Okay.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.895
Yeah. You have a serious abscess
on tooth number 18.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.698
How long has it been
since you last saw the dentist?

00:30.731 --> 00:33.867
-Um... four.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.337
Years?

00:36.370 --> 00:37.838
It's hard to find the time.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.840
My job schedule
is so unpredictable.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.709
But my tooth
has been killing me lately,

00:41.742 --> 00:43.411
so my friend referred me here.

00:43.444 --> 00:44.512
Really?

00:44.545 --> 00:45.813
Your friend referred you here?

00:48.048 --> 00:50.184
Well, she said
you have great lollipops.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.753
You are in luck. You've got the
best dentist in our practice.

00:52.786 --> 00:56.257
He's brilliant and gentle
and handsome.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.659
God, what I would give
to have him in my mouth.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.935
Oh... weird.
That looks like a young...

01:07.968 --> 01:10.571
Ronnie!

01:10.604 --> 01:13.541
Nope.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.642
PILOT :
Jackpot Airlines.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.544
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.547
*

01:27.087 --> 01:29.290
-Cheers!

01:29.323 --> 01:30.624
It's Ronnie!

01:30.658 --> 01:32.393
What happened the other day?

01:32.426 --> 01:33.894
Why did you run out on me?

01:33.927 --> 01:36.063
I'm sorry, Artem.
I was in shock.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.066
I had no idea that when you're
not gambling, you're a dentist.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.569
I just assumed you were
a guy who sold weird fruit

01:41.602 --> 01:43.404
out the back of a tire store.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.106
I'm sorry. Uh, did you say
Artem is a dentist?

01:46.140 --> 01:47.441
Yeah, pediatric dentist.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.776
Here's my card.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.110
Oh, the doll's head is there

01:50.144 --> 01:52.813
so you remember
I'm good with kids.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.283
Well, this will be hard
to ever, ever forget.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.084
So when are you gonna
reschedule?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.352
No need. It's all fixed now.

01:58.386 --> 01:59.487
Laughter and prayer.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.754
It turns out,
that's all you need.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.623
Well, that's good it's better,

02:02.656 --> 02:05.359
because if you still had
that abscess,

02:05.393 --> 02:08.929
flying now would be
excruciating.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.431
Uh... okay.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.266
E

02:12.300 --> 02:13.834
I'm asking for a friend.

02:13.867 --> 02:17.805
At higher altitudes,
trapped air in tooth expands

02:17.838 --> 02:21.275
against the nerve,
causing unbearable pain.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.777
And I don't know
why I'm telling you.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.646
-I should be telling this
to your friend.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.317
Are you this friend?

02:32.653 --> 02:34.188
Damn it, you're fast.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.856
I was captain of my high school
hand-slap team.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.024
No big deal.

02:37.057 --> 02:39.026
No, Alan, that is a big deal.

02:39.059 --> 02:41.028
I'm tired of you
selling yourself short.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.866
Hey. I had an idea.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.969
This flight, why don't
we keep our altitude, say,

02:49.002 --> 02:50.471
below 10,000 feet?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.906
Sorry, Ronnie. I don't tell
this old girl how high to fly.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.074
She tells me.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.476
That's not how it works at all.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.478
Alan, what did Dr. Becker say

02:57.511 --> 02:59.647
about contradicting me
in front of other people?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.148
It's like,
why do we go to therapy

03:01.181 --> 03:02.683
if you're not even gonna try?

03:09.690 --> 03:10.858
Beverage?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.160
Hello, Bernard.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.895
Captain Steve.

03:14.928 --> 03:15.996
Ow!

03:17.865 --> 03:19.500
Ah, what is your face made of?

03:19.533 --> 03:23.103
No, it's just "Steve" now,
ever since I got suspended

03:23.136 --> 03:24.672
for punching Captain Dave.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.839
I lost everything that day.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.942
My wife, my Miata, my mustache.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.344
I didn't deserve it anymore,

03:30.378 --> 03:32.012
so I shaved it off
and buried it in the backyard.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.180
Next to my dad.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.882
Oh, I'm sorry for your losses.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.517
So what are you doing here?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.786
I'm going to Jackpot HQ
to meet with the review board

03:38.819 --> 03:40.954
about getting reinstated
so I can get the life back

03:40.988 --> 03:42.523
that you all took from me.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.191
Well, we know you have
a choice of airlines

03:44.224 --> 03:45.959
when traveling to this or that
disciplinary hearing,

03:45.993 --> 03:48.396
so we thank you
for choosing Jackpot.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.101
Hey, that's weird.
Uh, what are you doing?

03:54.134 --> 03:57.070
Uh... I-I'm scanning my tooth
on the WebMD app.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.206
You're supposed to get
an instant diagnosis.

03:59.239 --> 04:03.110
And my tooth has...
Lou Gehrig's disease.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.546
Would it not be easier
just to go to the dentist

04:05.579 --> 04:06.614
every six months?

04:06.647 --> 04:08.549
What am I, the Queen of England?

04:08.582 --> 04:11.552
Every time I try to do something
for myself, something comes up.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.153
Like, I have to work
an extra turn

04:13.186 --> 04:14.822
or cover
for a sick flight attendant.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.223
Nichole gets it.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.791
We're both active professionals
on the go.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.493
We don't have time
for the dentist.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.595
Oh, no. I go to the dentist
every three months.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.063
Teeth are very important
to strippers.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.065
It's the first thing
customers notice.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.667
No. Breasts.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.068
It's breasts.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.503
Ronnie, we have a problem.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.605
Captain Steve is on the flight,
and he's very bitter.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.641
And not adorably bitter
like a late-in-life Lena Horne.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.909
Scary bitter
like a late-in-life Bette Davis.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.312
Love a reference from
this century once in a while.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.413
Hamilton.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.081
This is not good.
The last time

04:41.114 --> 04:42.850
Captain Steve and Captain Dave
were on a flight together,

04:42.883 --> 04:44.084
it did not end well.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.653
We can't let them anywhere
near each other.

04:45.686 --> 04:46.987
"We"? I've already done my part.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.356
I identified the problem,

04:48.389 --> 04:49.757
deflected it
with a withering bon mot,

04:49.790 --> 04:51.091
then kicked it over to you.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.595
O-Okay, just don't let Dave
anywhere near the cabin.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.863
I'll try, but...

04:55.896 --> 04:57.097
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.900
This just feels
so good right now.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.005
Hey there, passengers.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.174
If you find yourself in Vegas
on a Friday night,

05:07.207 --> 05:11.178
why not celebrate the Sabbath
the way Captain Dave does?

05:11.211 --> 05:14.348
Praying the night away
at Temple Beth Vegas,

05:14.382 --> 05:16.850
where you'll find the best
all-you-can-eat Oneg,

05:16.884 --> 05:20.354
and the loosest slots
this side of Haifa.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.690
I'm gonna go do my rounds.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.493
Kiss some hands
and shake some babies.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.028
Oh, hey, Bernie.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.963
Hey.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.198
What...?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.701
Can I, uh... get through?

05:33.734 --> 05:36.470
Um... you know
what I just realized?

05:36.504 --> 05:38.539
You never told me
what it was like going vegan.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.174
Oh, I am so glad you asked.

05:41.208 --> 05:45.145
You see, Bern, if you stretch
the human digestive tract

05:45.178 --> 05:48.148
and lay it next to that
of a true omnivore,

05:48.181 --> 05:51.218
like a grizzly bear,
there's only one conclusion:

05:51.251 --> 05:53.621
we're herbivores, my friend.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.156
Can I get through?

05:56.189 --> 05:58.492
Sorry, we're going to be doing
beverage service indefinitely.

05:58.526 --> 06:01.695
Why don't you sit down and go
back to your... Doobie Brothers,

06:01.729 --> 06:02.863
or whatever?

06:02.896 --> 06:04.197
Doobie Brothers? Please.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.199
This Discman only plays Seger.

06:06.233 --> 06:10.003
Mainly 'cause it's been
stuck closed since 2004.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.371
GORDON:
Excuse me, miss.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.873
Could I get a diet soda?

06:12.906 --> 06:15.743
Uh-huh.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.880
This is all foam.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.454
Okay, you know what?

06:26.487 --> 06:27.855
Why don't you just take the can?

06:27.888 --> 06:30.591
Beverage service today
is if you're thirsty,

06:30.624 --> 06:32.359
you should've thought about that
at the airport,

06:32.392 --> 06:33.761
and gotten something then!

06:35.929 --> 06:38.231
Of course, after eight days
of no erections,

06:38.265 --> 06:40.468
I realized I needed
some red meat.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.470
So I'm back on steak.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.505
And now, I wait.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.709
-Oh, no.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.210
We have a Ronnie down!

06:50.243 --> 06:51.278
Make way, I'm a captain.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.345
Make way,
I'm a captain.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.382
Captain Steve.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.050
Captain Dave.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.151
I'm okay.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.187
Oh, crap.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.794
DAVE: What the hell
are you doing on my plane?

07:06.827 --> 07:07.961
It's not your plane.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.597
Your name isn't Dave Jackpot.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.998
It is on several
dating Web sites.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.165
You don't know.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.567
I know you ruined me the moment

07:13.601 --> 07:15.669
you ran your weird face
into my fist.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.004
You're lucky
that was a sucker punch.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.472
If it had been a real fight,
I would've given you

07:18.506 --> 07:20.107
a one-way ticket to Pain Island.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.742
Population: you.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.677
I'm standing right here.
Now's your chance.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.178
No, I'm on duty.
Unlike some people,

07:25.212 --> 07:26.614
I don't fight my passengers.

07:26.647 --> 07:27.915
That's fine.
I can wait till we land.

07:27.948 --> 07:28.982
How long's your turnaround?

07:29.016 --> 07:30.150
-An hour.
-Perfect.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.351
Gives me a half hour to warm up,

07:31.384 --> 07:32.520
ten minutes to kick your ass

07:32.553 --> 07:34.488
and 20 minutes
to high-five all my fans.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.590
That is, of course,
unless you're scared.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.627
The only thing I'm scared of
is your naked under-nose.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.596
Have some respect,
and cover that thing up.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.131
-It's on.
-Oh, it's on.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.033
Lost luggage room, 3:00 p.m.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.968
Barring any weather delays.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.369
Oh, of course.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.004
-About 20 knots.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.039
That's not so bad.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.674
We could maybe push it to 2:50.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.543
The way I fly, make it 2:45.

07:55.576 --> 07:58.078
:
This is so dumb.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.555
Oh, no, this is worse
than I suspected.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.156
Your mouth looks exactly how

08:09.189 --> 08:10.791
other people are sure
my mouth looks.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.826
Artem, you have to help me.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.828
I cannot take
another flight like this,

08:14.862 --> 08:16.296
and my turn is in an hour.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.565
Is there anything you can do?

08:17.598 --> 08:20.568
Ronnie always help Artem
on the plane,

08:20.601 --> 08:23.236
so it would be an honor
to help you here on the ground.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.706
Ronnie. What are you gonna do
about this Steve

08:25.739 --> 08:26.874
We can't actually
let them fight.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.508
I have my own problems, Bernard.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.343
I have to get this tooth fixed
before our next flight.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.478
I don't have time to worry about

08:31.511 --> 08:32.846
what those two dummies
are doing.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.715
Forget them. I'm the dummy
I'm worried about.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.984
This fight could delay
our turn back to L.A.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.418
And I have a date
at Musso & Frank's

08:38.451 --> 08:40.320
with a married Swede
I met in a chat room.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.389
I'm sorry,
but I cannot always be fixing

08:42.422 --> 08:44.257
everybody else's stuff.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.760
If you want to stop the fight,
be my guest and stop the fight.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.428
Let's go, Artem.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.731
No, o-oh, just a moment,
I have to give Nichole

08:50.764 --> 08:54.467
my secret recipe for... queso.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.170
'Kay, so, there's gonna be

08:57.204 --> 08:58.872
a lot of action
on this pilot fight.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.240
#PilotFight.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.275
I have no time for bets,

09:02.309 --> 09:05.112
but as my protégé,
you are in charge.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.680
Artem, I'm so honored.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.015
Wait.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.583
We're gonna be splitting
that money 50

09:09.617 --> 09:10.851
Because I'm gonna need cash

09:10.884 --> 09:12.686
if I'm gonna start buying
freshwater lakes.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.354
It's what the wars of the future
will be fought over.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.522
Of course.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.124
We're equal partners.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.026
Hey, I have a strong feeling

09:19.059 --> 09:21.528
that Captain Dave
will win this fight.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.865
He has this sad rage in him.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.967
That means you have to encourage

09:27.000 --> 09:29.703
hefty bets on Captain Steve.

09:29.737 --> 09:30.804
You can count on me.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.439
-I know I can.

09:32.472 --> 09:35.976
That's why the little black book
is yours.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.310
Wow.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.480
Steffi Graf,
Angela Merkel, Sade?

09:40.513 --> 09:42.716
I'm sorry, that's the wrong
little black book.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.884
Here.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.919
Oh.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.421
BERNARD:
Dave?

09:48.455 --> 09:49.556
-You and I need to talk.
-We do.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.824
Which of these do you like?

09:50.858 --> 09:52.125
I'm looking
for something intimidating

09:52.159 --> 09:54.161
that breathes,
and doesn't skimp on style.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.428
You don't have to do this.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.496
You're the guy
who's still flying.

09:56.529 --> 09:57.831
You already won.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.332
And I'll be the real winner
when I'm sharing

09:59.366 --> 10:02.169
a shrimp cocktail with
my Swedish orthopedist Bjorn.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.336
The "J" is silent.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.838
Just like his love for me.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.239
Look, I have to fight Steve.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.008
My honor is at stake here.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.509
Like when I was a teenager,
my dad was gonna buy

10:09.542 --> 10:11.244
that ski resort
to turn into condos,

10:11.278 --> 10:13.246
until a scrappy ski instructor
beat me in that race

10:13.280 --> 10:14.682
down Devil's Backbone.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.449
So you were the villain
in an '80s ski movie?

10:16.483 --> 10:17.751
No, I was the good guy.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.753
Those condos would've been
state-of-the-art.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.588
Look, everyone that works
in this airport

10:21.621 --> 10:23.090
knows that Steve challenged me.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.958
If I back out now,
I'll lose their respect

10:24.992 --> 10:26.827
and maybe never get it back.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.195
I can't let them see me
as a coward.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.596
Colin, will you please
talk some sense

10:29.629 --> 10:31.699
and tell Dave this fight
won't solve anything?

10:31.732 --> 10:34.034
Well, actually,
it may solve quite a lot.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.036
As a university-trained boxer,

10:36.069 --> 10:38.338
I believe that physical
confrontation is an effective

10:38.371 --> 10:41.374
and downright zesty means
of conflict resolution.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.676
You know, I have some time

10:42.710 --> 10:44.144
before I pick my son up
from school.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.278
Maybe we could train together?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.313
I'll show you some tips.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.314
Let's do it then.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.349
Donna, put this on my tab.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.387
And here you stand, Bernard,
forsaken and alone.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.223
Like a young Hedy Lamarr's
Joan of Arc.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.892
With no around to tell you
they don't get that reference.

10:58.926 --> 11:01.494
All right, we don't have time to
go to a real dentist's office,

11:01.528 --> 11:03.163
so hopefully this place will
have to work.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.665
Oh, this is like a little
airport hospital.

11:05.699 --> 11:08.335
Is this where sick airplanes go?

11:08.368 --> 11:10.738
This is the Vegas airport
medical office.

11:10.771 --> 11:14.041
It's mainly used for hangovers,
stripper-heel ankle sprains,

11:14.074 --> 11:16.576
and people still tripping
from last night's EDM show.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.179
I need to lick something
or else I'll die.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.715
I just don't know if they have
any dentist stuff here.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.417
Don't worry, I got my own
dental emergency kit.

11:24.451 --> 11:28.221
I have some fun pokey things,
and some fun scrape-y things...

11:28.255 --> 11:31.091
Whatever. Just use all of it.
You have half an hour,

11:31.124 --> 11:32.926
so start scraping
and start poking.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.363
Okay, listen, one important
question before we start.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.833
Which tablet would you like
to use for cartoons?

11:39.867 --> 11:41.368
The panda or penguin?

11:41.401 --> 11:44.271
Artem, I'm not a child.
Penguin.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.638
Good choice.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.013
Okay, David, we are gonna start
with a simple combination.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.915
Jab, cross, then you slip
when I counter.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.385
Ow. That's not cool.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.787
That's okay. We'll go again.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.789
Remember to dodge
when I counter.

12:01.822 --> 12:04.124
-You don't have to tell me
twice. -Okay.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.059
Try again.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.898
Why don't you use your martial
arts training for this fight?

12:10.931 --> 12:13.901
Oh, I would never.
Muay Thai is a sacred discipline

12:13.934 --> 12:15.735
whose purpose is
the enrichment of the soul.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.304
And besides, they moved
my book club to Tuesday nights,

12:17.337 --> 12:18.806
so I had to make some
hard choices.

12:18.839 --> 12:19.973
Yeah, schedules can be
difficult.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.141
That's fine, we'll go again.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.876
Okay. Jab, cross, slip.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.778
Just... slip means
get out of the way.

12:24.812 --> 12:28.148
So, again, that's jab, cross,
get out of the way.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.985
Damn it.
This would be easier if I knew

12:32.019 --> 12:33.286
which hand you were
punching with.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.322
Just tell me, right or left,
and then I'll move.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.925
Steve's not gonna announce which
hand he's gonna punch you with.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.260
He will, if we make it a rule.
Like in pool.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.995
You call the pocket first.
Eight ball, corner pocket.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.663
Same thing:
left hand, your face.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.765
-Oh, God this is gonna be harder
than I thought. -Oh.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.734
Come on, man,
I was wiping my brow.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.103
Then do my rule-- call out
"left hand, wiping brow."

12:50.137 --> 12:52.772
Wait, so Captain Steve and
Captain Dave are gonna fight?

12:52.806 --> 12:55.843
Oh, yeah. We're calling it
"Pilot Pummel I: The Rematch."

12:55.876 --> 12:58.345
Ten to one Dave wins
in a knockout. Are you in?

12:58.378 --> 13:00.914
Hell yeah. With those odds,
put me down for $50 on Steve.

13:00.948 --> 13:04.517
Just $50? Come on.
If you put in $250,

13:04.551 --> 13:06.086
I'll make one of those
whisper videos

13:06.119 --> 13:09.022
where I talk real quiet
while I fold a napkin.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.924
-Deal.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.827
$250 on Steve.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.728
$100 on Steve.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.802
$500 on Steve.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.074
:

13:31.544 --> 13:34.581
*

13:39.086 --> 13:42.389
$1,500 on Steve...
and Dave falling in love?

13:42.422 --> 13:44.524
I'm a romantic.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.494
Steve, listen...

13:47.527 --> 13:49.529
*

13:52.599 --> 13:55.903
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.071
Listen, you, I'm calling off
this fight.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.806
Stay out of this, Bernard.

13:59.839 --> 14:00.908
Say my name again.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.043
No! This is crazy.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.411
You are two grown men.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.913
You shouldn't be settling
your differences

14:05.946 --> 14:07.580
in a lost luggage room
in the middle of the day.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.250
You're not fighting.
Now, say my name again.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.719
This is happening. There's
nothing you can do to stop it.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.254
You just got caught up
in the moment.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.089
Take a step back
and think about this.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.091
Think about this?
Please.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.760
That's all I've thought about
for months.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.896
I'm not meeting
with the Jackpot Review Board.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.198
The only reason
I was on that plane

14:25.232 --> 14:26.666
was to get Dave to fight me.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.369
I've spent every day
since that flight

14:29.402 --> 14:32.205
waiting, watching, training.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.442
White lightning.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.510
That's right, Bernard.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.946
This isn't gonna be a fight.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.882
It's gonna be a massacre.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.861
Okay, Ronnie, so I cemented

14:54.894 --> 14:57.197
the temporary cap
to your molar.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.799
I want you to bite down
on this cotton roll

14:59.832 --> 15:01.868
until the cement is dry, okay?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.070
Uh-huh.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.972
Ronnie. Problem.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.639
This pilot fight is getting
out of hand.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.075
Steve is gonna murder Dave.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.709
:
What are you talking about?

15:09.742 --> 15:12.412
I saw him warming up.
He's so powerful and raw.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.714
In my Revenant fantasy, he'll
now be starring as the bear.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.583
Hey. Captain Steve is gonna win?

15:16.616 --> 15:19.586
Yes. I need you.
This is not my department.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.754
This is like sporting goods,
and I'm men's fragrances.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.756
Oh, ah. If Dave is really
in trouble...

15:23.790 --> 15:26.826
-No-no-no, you're not going
nowhere. Open mouth. -Ah.

15:26.859 --> 15:29.429
Close it.
Today, you have to be patient.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.731
Both as a noun and adjective.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.932
-But I have...
-No buts!

15:32.966 --> 15:34.167
Dr. Artem's order.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.336
You have to wait here until
the cement is dry.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.106
It's gonna be, like, 20 minutes.
No moving, no talking.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.274
-I'll fix it.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.909
Okay, Captain Steve is
gonna win,

15:42.942 --> 15:45.345
so we have to change
the betting line immediately.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.913
This was your plan to handle it?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.582
Yes, because Nichole and I were
gonna lose money.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.984
Wasn't that everybody's concern?

15:51.018 --> 15:53.153
Artem, I've already taken

15:53.186 --> 15:55.522
thousands of dollars
of bets on Steve.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.291
Thousands? Oh, we have to
stop this fight.

15:58.325 --> 16:01.361
Bitch, I've been saying that
for the last half hour.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.834
So, what do you think?
Not too bad, huh?

16:07.867 --> 16:09.169
Well, you stopped
yelling "punch"

16:09.202 --> 16:12.439
every time you threw a punch,
so that's progress.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.540
Why don't we take a short break?

16:13.573 --> 16:15.442
-Okay, you catch your breath.
-Ah.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.676
Maybe put your affairs in order,

16:16.709 --> 16:17.810
and we'll meet back here
in five.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.479
How's that, champ?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.316
Punch, punch!

16:23.350 --> 16:25.618
-Ah! I'm doing it again.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.387
Quick update:
get here immediately.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.622
Is this about the fight? Artem
and Bernard are handling it.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.124
Right, nobody
is handling anything.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.992
Do you know how I know?
Because right now,

16:33.026 --> 16:34.961
I am watching Steve
walk into this room.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.396
RONNIE:
I am not supposed to move.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.997
I shouldn't even be talking.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.866
Look, Ronnie, I know
you don't want this role,

16:39.899 --> 16:41.734
but you are quite possibly
the only person

16:41.768 --> 16:43.303
in this entire airport

16:43.336 --> 16:45.538
capable of stopping
an imminent calamity.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.074
We need you.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.409
-Punch, punch! Whoo!

16:52.212 --> 16:54.314
So what are you saying?
He punched a wall?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.049
Big deal. I've punched
hundreds of them.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.851
Besides, Colin's been
training me. I'm good.

16:58.885 --> 17:01.088
No, you're quite literally
the worst boxer I've ever seen.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.222
You should walk away now,

17:02.255 --> 17:03.390
while you still
have the use of your legs.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.591
Yeah, you might die.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.326
Why the hell didn't you tell me
all this sooner?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.560
I can't back down now.

17:07.594 --> 17:08.861
Look at all these people
watching.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.430
I'll lose their respect forever.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.565
There is another way.
You could fight dirty.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.901
It's cheap and you'd have to
completely abandon your dignity.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.203
Great, let's do that then.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.738
So, stick to biting,
pulling hair,

17:18.771 --> 17:22.442
and if in doubt,
you throw sand in his face.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.411
Wait, you carry sand around
in your pocket?

17:24.444 --> 17:26.379
Yeah, it's a good thing
I do, right?

17:26.413 --> 17:28.348
You ready to rumble,
you son of a bitch?

17:28.381 --> 17:29.782
MAN:
Oh, did you hear that?

17:29.816 --> 17:32.285
-Go get 'em.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.721
-Okay.
-Yeah.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.430
-WOMAN: Come on, Dave!

17:45.064 --> 17:47.600
I've been dreaming about kicking
your ass for a long time, Dave.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.603
Well, that's not gonna happen,
so keep dreaming, Pam Ewing!

17:50.637 --> 17:52.439
-From Dallas.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.307
All of season nine
was Pam Ewing's dream.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.542
You never watched Dallas?

17:55.575 --> 17:58.044
I believe it's pronounced
"Da-yas."

17:58.077 --> 18:00.247
Say good night, Steve!

18:00.280 --> 18:03.150
Stop! That is enough.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.984
What the hell are you two doing?

18:05.017 --> 18:06.419
You're acting like children.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.488
Show me one child
with a mustache like this.

18:08.521 --> 18:09.956
Foreigners don't count.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.658
Oh, if you two idiots
could forget about

18:11.691 --> 18:13.726
this stupid grudge
for one minute,

18:13.760 --> 18:15.928
I bet you'd realize
you have a lot in common.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.265
Like what?

18:18.298 --> 18:20.767
Uh... well, um...

18:20.800 --> 18:23.270
Oh, Seger!

18:23.303 --> 18:26.173
You like Bob Seger.
So does Dave.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.007
I don't like Bob Seger.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.443
I love Bob Seger.

18:30.477 --> 18:34.147
Uh...

18:34.181 --> 18:35.182
Steve drives a Miata!

18:35.215 --> 18:38.751
Oh! You both love cars
marketed to women.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.588
What's wrong with a sporty car
that's tight around corners?

18:41.621 --> 18:43.990
My Pontiac Sunfire
used to have 'em screaming.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.525
Just ask my ex, Keisha.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.295
I dated a Keisha.
Distefano? -Berardi.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.663
BOTH:
Both Italian.

18:50.697 --> 18:53.933
Now do you see
what I'm talking about?

18:56.169 --> 18:59.539
This might be weird,
but do you also, um,

18:59.572 --> 19:00.873
sometimes feel like the sky

19:00.907 --> 19:02.342
is the only one
that understands you?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.377
Sometimes?

19:04.411 --> 19:06.346
Try all the time.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.215
My God.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.450
We're like the same person.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.819
You see? You were both
about to beat up

19:12.852 --> 19:15.655
the only other person
in the world who truly gets you.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.190
Friends?

19:17.224 --> 19:19.526
Brothers.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.898
Oh, my God, people.
Get a life!

19:25.932 --> 19:27.600
Fight already!

19:29.001 --> 19:31.238
MAN:
Oh!

19:31.271 --> 19:33.306
(indistinct announcement
on P.A.)

19:33.340 --> 19:36.743
Hey, champ.
How's the tooth?

19:36.776 --> 19:40.012
Oh... Artem has to redo
the whole thing.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.715
But luckily, the luggage
knocked out another tooth,

19:42.749 --> 19:44.984
-and that hurts a lot more.
-Well, even though

19:45.017 --> 19:46.185
it cost you a pair of teeth,

19:46.219 --> 19:47.820
at least you can feel good
knowing that,

19:47.854 --> 19:49.889
-yet again, you saved the day.
-Yeah.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.724
At least being the person
who fixes

19:51.758 --> 19:54.361
other people's screwups makes
my life seem less like a mess.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.696
Well, you're in luck,
because none of us

19:56.729 --> 19:59.966
are in any danger of getting
our acts together... ever.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.535
Hey, guys.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.003
You two must be happy.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.038
You narrowly avoided losing
heaps of money.

20:06.072 --> 20:09.776
Mm-mm. We lost a bundle.
To Alan.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.210
But the fight didn't
even happen.

20:11.244 --> 20:14.247
-Right. Because Steve and Dave
fell in love. -Mm.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.383
Ronnie, will you hold
this money for me?

20:16.416 --> 20:18.285
Otherwise, it'll go
right up my nose.

20:24.757 --> 20:28.227
I can't thank you enough for
helping me earn back my wings.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.963
Hey, we're brothers,
and I told those Jackpot suits,

20:30.997 --> 20:34.133
if my brother can't fly,
I can't fly.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.468
And now look at us.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.405
Two straight-up Norse gods
ready to conquer the sky.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.107
And to think,
I almost gave you a beatdown.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.942
Don't make me laugh, old man.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.444
I would've kicked your ass

20:44.477 --> 20:46.713
-from here to Da-yas,
Fort Worth.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.915
Well, time to fly.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.917
Let's do this.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.985
Uh, what are you doing?

20:53.019 --> 20:55.788
What do you mean? I'm the pilot,
you're the co-pilot.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.824
I don't "co" anything.
I'm the captain.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.293
You are loco in the cabeza
if you think

21:00.327 --> 21:01.528
you're gonna fly this thing.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.898
Out of my way!

21:05.932 --> 21:08.335
-No, get out of my way!
-Get out of my way!

21:13.039 --> 21:14.907
This is so dumb.
