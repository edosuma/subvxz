Yo, check this out. I'm hard-core.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.156
I had a lid on this game.
I had this sewed up, man.

05:05.376 --> 05:07.915
Then I heard these motherfuckers, CB4.

05:08.130 --> 05:12.959
These motherfuckers is real, G.
They show me their guns, G.

05:13.178 --> 05:17.423
What the fuck I'm supposed
to do now, man? Can't dance.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.218
Shit's fucked up.

05:20.060 --> 05:25.483
But I met 'em. Gusto stepped to me.
He said, "Yo, Ice. You down with CB4."

05:25.692 --> 05:27.601
I was blessed, man.

05:27.818 --> 05:30.904
If I had to choose one,
I'm Gusto all the way.

05:31.114 --> 05:34.567
It's those gold teeth that...
Something, I don' know.

05:34.785 --> 05:36.908
Gusto. Is that it?

05:37.121 --> 05:40.289
I saw Gusto one day.
We was at a park picnic.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.915
You know, he was with his family.

05:44.130 --> 05:48.423
I didn't wanna trip, you know, cos his
people was there. His pops was there.

05:48.633 --> 05:51.968
I didn't wanna trip. I just played
the background and kicked it.

05:52.180 --> 05:54.753
I'll catch him, you know,
at a swap meet or somethin'.

05:54.975 --> 05:59.554
[White] Question, Flav.
How does CB4 fit into the world of rap?

05:59.771 --> 06:02.346
Let me tell you somethin'.
They don't fit, you know?

06:02.567 --> 06:04.393
They're kinda wack. Word up, G.

06:04.611 --> 06:09.688
Yo, man, they perpetrators, man. The
whole nine. They real fuckin' fake, kid.

06:09.908 --> 06:14.487
I think It's unfair that Cell Block 4
is being picked on...

06:14.705 --> 06:19.332
At other concerts where they have
rat heads, cat heads being bit off,

06:19.544 --> 06:23.589
spittin' in a cup and passing it around,
gettin' it back and drinkin' it...

06:23.799 --> 06:28.428
First of all, motherfucker need
to cut that long shit he got drippin'.

06:28.639 --> 06:32.174
All that shit, you know. Cut it down
my size or somethin', you know.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.145
<i>The first time I heard
Sweat Of My Balls,</i>

06:37.190 --> 06:41.934
I was naked with the first black woman
I've ever made love to.

06:42.153 --> 06:43.695
[White] Ooh, kinky.

06:43.906 --> 06:45.815
How did that make you feel?

06:46.033 --> 06:49.284
There was actually sweat on my balls.

06:50.246 --> 06:54.458
<i>[White] Not everyone had the insight
to understand CB4's greatness.</i>

06:54.668 --> 06:57.539
Cell Black 4? Excuse me, Cell Block 4

06:57.754 --> 07:01.040
has polluted the airwaves
of this nation for too long.

07:01.258 --> 07:05.174
Their record of incitement,
lewdness, poor grammar

07:05.388 --> 07:09.387
will see them jailed, banned
and with their feelings hurt.

07:09.601 --> 07:13.812
As you've probably gathered, this
is notjust a movie about rap music.

07:14.022 --> 07:15.398
It's about much more.

07:15.608 --> 07:17.602
It's about this great nation of ours,

07:17.819 --> 07:20.359
and how it gives everybody
a chance to make it.

07:20.573 --> 07:24.902
It's about three ghetto kids' rise from
the mean streets to the sales sheets.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.159
- [man] Excuse me.
- From the world's most notorious...

07:27.371 --> 07:29.945
- [gunshots]
- Fellas, what are you doing?

07:30.166 --> 07:34.164
That must hurt. Give that back!
That's mine! I'm shooting...

07:35.505 --> 07:37.415
- [sighing]
- Oh, jeez!

07:38.218 --> 07:40.376
Fellas, guys, I'm sorry.

07:40.595 --> 07:44.426
That dumbhead editor!
He cut in the wrong take.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.635
A thousand apologies. I am so sorry.

07:46.852 --> 07:49.807
Why did we hire this other man
instead of the brother man?

07:50.022 --> 07:53.357
Because the other man is much cheaper
than the brother man.

07:54.193 --> 07:57.361
Guys, what I need,
what my documentary is missing

07:57.572 --> 07:59.612
is really quite simple.

07:59.824 --> 08:02.364
I need to know
who Cell Block 4 really is.

08:02.579 --> 08:05.947
I want to know how you guys think,
what you feel.

08:06.164 --> 08:10.959
What do you guys eat? I don't know that.
Do you like sandwiches, fondue?

08:11.171 --> 08:14.920
- How do you guys sleep at night?
- I'm outta here. You clown.

08:15.133 --> 08:19.179
- This motherfucker's bullshit.
- What did I say?

08:20.265 --> 08:22.056
Yo, chill.

08:22.267 --> 08:24.973
I'm gonna let him hang out
with me today, all right?

08:27.647 --> 08:29.558
Thanks. You're not gonna be sorry.

08:29.859 --> 08:33.561
OK, sorry.
Come on, Herb, grab your stuff.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.821
Corny ass motherfucker.

08:36.909 --> 08:40.741
Again, MC, I wanna thank you
for letting me hang with you today.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.575
It's gonna be fun. Look at that Jeep!

08:44.794 --> 08:49.705
Cool! I drive something sorta like that.
It's a big ol' Country Squire.

08:49.924 --> 08:52.130
It was my dad's car. It's sorta like it.

09:00.394 --> 09:03.679
What MC Gusto just did
was rip up a state-issued ticket

09:03.898 --> 09:08.062
which he has no plans of paying,
a natural act of defiance by rappers.

09:08.278 --> 09:11.315
He's putting in a new jam
for us to listen to and...

09:11.531 --> 09:14.403
Yo, White!
Chill on the blow-by-blow, all right?

09:14.618 --> 09:16.030
I'm sorry.

09:16.246 --> 09:18.403
<i># It feels like I'm living in a zoo...</i>

09:18.622 --> 09:20.912
I like this. Who is it?

09:22.586 --> 09:24.460
Gold, gold, gold.

09:24.672 --> 09:27.044
Another one goes gold.

09:27.259 --> 09:28.883

you can't Trustus.

<i>[man] You can trust
you're gonna be dead soon.</i>

09:39.481 --> 09:42.565
And guess who's next? CB4.

09:42.775 --> 09:44.815
<i>They ghost. [dial tone]</i>

09:51.702 --> 09:53.742
That was great!

09:53.955 --> 09:59.413
Gusto, does the whole idea of CB4
getting together in just two days

09:59.629 --> 10:02.795
kind of fill you with high anxiety?

10:03.006 --> 10:08.214
Do you actually think a brother who
was rollin' and controllin' Cell Block 4

10:08.429 --> 10:10.589
is worried about rockin' the mic?

10:10.807 --> 10:12.467
- Please!
- [car phone beeping]

10:13.309 --> 10:15.636
Must be one of my bitches. Hello.

10:15.855 --> 10:19.307
Hey, bitch, look in your
rear-view mirror, motherfucker.

10:19.526 --> 10:20.807
Shit!

10:21.571 --> 10:23.313
[White] What's happening?

10:25.073 --> 10:28.277
- Want me to hold the wheel?
- Get close to the motherfucker.

10:30.914 --> 10:32.787
It's my first drive-by.

10:33.916 --> 10:35.625
We gotta go.

10:38.088 --> 10:39.548
Get up on 'em, man.

10:42.385 --> 10:45.551
- My fuckin' radio!
- Need some new jams, bitch!

10:47.683 --> 10:49.758
Ma! Ma!

10:51.020 --> 10:53.060
[White] Cool turn!

10:55.649 --> 10:58.687
- Only a fool would follow me up here.
- Where are we going?

11:00.446 --> 11:02.239
Stop right here!

11:03.284 --> 11:05.988
- I'm crazy but I ain't no fool.
- I ain't no fool.

11:14.713 --> 11:17.250
Jeez, we got all shot up.

11:17.467 --> 11:21.713
There's only one word for
that kind of thing in my book. "Wild".

11:21.930 --> 11:24.173
You guys OK back there?

11:24.391 --> 11:26.798
MC, why were they shooting at us?

11:27.018 --> 11:29.177
Us? Us?

11:29.397 --> 11:32.314
They weren't shooting at us.
They were shootin' at me.

11:33.192 --> 11:37.321
I could've died today. It'd have gone
down as a simple-ass drive-by.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.616
- You know shit about Cell Block 4.
- No. That's not true.

11:40.826 --> 11:43.234
- I know you guys are...
- You got lots of tape?

11:44.665 --> 11:46.123
Good.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.372
Cos I'm gonna
let you in on something.

11:48.584 --> 11:51.159
OK, fine.
But keep it tight. I do the narrations.

11:51.379 --> 11:53.953
<i>[Albert] All my life

- Come on, Pops.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.489
- I already got it on one.
- Put it on negative one.

12:22.708 --> 12:25.791
Make us both happy and turn it off.

12:26.002 --> 12:29.501
I like this music. I like what
it's about. I like the way it sounds.

12:29.714 --> 12:33.049
Albie, I don't understand
this gangster-rap attitude

12:33.261 --> 12:35.135
you're so fascinated with.

12:35.347 --> 12:38.182
Why don't we listen to Lenny Kravitz?

12:38.392 --> 12:41.392
It's just music. You act
as if I was plannin' a drive-by.

12:41.602 --> 12:45.518
I'm gonna drive by and whip your ass
if you don't turn that music down.

12:45.733 --> 12:48.106
Why ain't you in school?
How come you home?

12:48.320 --> 12:51.569
- It's Saturday, Pops.
- So, go look at a school.

12:51.781 --> 12:53.989
Don't waste electricity
on that rap mess.

12:54.201 --> 12:57.202
- But Pop!
- Don't "but" me.

12:57.412 --> 13:00.782
I'll beat your ass in front of
your woman. No rap in my house.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.251
In our day, they sang.
That rap ain't nothin' but talkin'.

13:04.463 --> 13:08.129
It won't never last!

14:02.071 --> 14:08.109
As you can see, my loved ones
really respected my musical taste.

14:08.326 --> 14:12.491
Was Stab Master Arson
also middle class?

14:13.500 --> 14:17.248
<i>[Albert] Well, Otis came from
a different environment altogether.</i>

14:19.507 --> 14:22.176
Come on in, Albert.
We're just finishing dinner.

14:22.384 --> 14:24.877
I knew I should've came earlier.
How are you?

14:25.095 --> 14:28.679
- OK.
- [girl] Look, it's Albert! Hi, Albert!

14:30.352 --> 14:31.846
What's up, Tashana,

14:32.061 --> 14:36.107
Tawana, Tamika, Talona and Tee Tee?

14:37.610 --> 14:39.271
Hi, Albert.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.610
- What's up, O?
- What up, bro?

14:42.991 --> 14:46.360
- How long is Otis gonna be out?
- 'Bout 11.00.

14:46.579 --> 14:50.114
- He gotta help me with my homework.
- And relax my hair.

14:50.333 --> 14:54.415
- And play me in Nintendo.
- And sew me a new dress.

14:54.672 --> 14:57.756
- And program my computer.
- Check this out.

14:57.966 --> 15:00.007
Get outta here.
We got stuff to do.

15:03.306 --> 15:04.968
- Bye, Mom.
- [all] Bye, Otis!

15:05.309 --> 15:07.348
Leave my sisters alone.

15:09.855 --> 15:12.181
Otis, you are the man of the house.

15:12.401 --> 15:14.439
I gotta be, with all those sisters.

15:14.652 --> 15:18.353
Don't worry. Tonight we're gonna have
crazy fun! Let's pick up Rip.

15:18.573 --> 15:19.735
Rip is sick.

15:19.950 --> 15:22.987
- You see the new En Vogue video?
- Cindy is fine!

15:23.203 --> 15:26.490
Cindy's fine but she's not the one.
Teri's the one.

15:27.626 --> 15:31.326
- Then Cindy's the other one, man.
- She got them eyes!

15:31.547 --> 15:34.216
I wanna suck her like a neck bone.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.174
I wanna suck this like a neck bone.

15:37.387 --> 15:40.387
Correction. I wanna suck her
like a smoked neck bone.

15:46.897 --> 15:49.814
Euripides Smalls
was Dead Mike's real name.

15:50.026 --> 15:54.071
Rip came from a broken home which meant
he hustled for every dollar he made.

15:54.281 --> 15:56.321
Ooh, a hustler.

[man] OK, call again. Thank you.

16:21.895 --> 16:24.518
Hello, 976-FART. You fart, we smell it.

16:26.693 --> 16:28.484
I feel so slippery.

16:28.695 --> 16:30.984
976-SEXY

16:31.198 --> 16:34.068
- Yo, I wanna...
- Man, let's get out of here.

Kiss my fuckin' ass.

16:52.848 --> 16:54.756
Thank you. Call again.

16:54.975 --> 16:58.510
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where I might find Euripides Smalls?

16:58.730 --> 17:00.521
- Right down there.
- Thanks a lot.

Yeah, I'm lickin' your balls.

17:24.840 --> 17:28.425
Best balls I ever had.
You got King Kong balls.

17:30.891 --> 17:35.434
Your balls is so large...
Just big balls, I don't care.

17:38.984 --> 17:42.815
Peace! I hate this job.
This ain't no job for no black man!

17:43.029 --> 17:45.485
Yo, let's go down
to Gusto's, all right?

17:45.783 --> 17:47.822
We got some problems to lick.

17:49.412 --> 17:53.161
If you ask me,
George Jefferson was a sell-out.

17:53.374 --> 17:56.993
He thought success
was livin' in a white man's buildin'

17:57.211 --> 18:00.167
and disrespectin'
his African-American employees.

18:00.382 --> 18:04.333
No, you don't understand.
The cool thing about George Jefferson

18:04.554 --> 18:08.422
was he hated every white person he met,
unless they had a cheque for him.

18:08.642 --> 18:11.264
Tom Willis come over,
the door slammed in his face.

18:11.478 --> 18:15.560
But soon as somebody had a cheque for
him, "Hey, Weezie, fix him up a plate."

18:15.775 --> 18:18.480
- Ain't I right, Otis?
- Yeah, right and tight.

18:18.695 --> 18:20.772
That's a real role model to me.

18:20.989 --> 18:23.481
- Do you got the tape?
- Yeah, but I'm Run.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.944
- I'm DMC.
- Why can't I be DMC?

18:26.162 --> 18:29.412
- Cos you Jam Master Jay.
- I'm always Jam Master.

18:29.624 --> 18:32.745
Me and you will do DMC together,
is that all right with you?

18:32.962 --> 18:33.957
- All right.
- Cool.

Now, we were already a rap group,
but we had no direction.

- Every week we'd go down to Gusto's...
- No. Excuse me.

19:54.721 --> 19:58.969
Now you've got me completely scrambled
up here. I thought you were Gusto.

19:59.184 --> 20:01.890
Chill. You'll understand
everything in a minute.

20:03.563 --> 20:06.767
<i>Every week we go to Gusto's
and check out open mic nights.</i>

20:06.985 --> 20:11.113

20:27.842 --> 20:32.089

20:32.305 --> 20:35.970
<i>We met people at Gusto's
who would forever change our lives.</i>

20:37.393 --> 20:41.439
Brothers, my name is Baa Baa Ack.

20:41.649 --> 20:45.978
I carry the message to the black man
with me wherever I go.

20:46.195 --> 20:48.983
I got my message right here, black man.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.358
We don't need that back-to-Egypt shit.

20:51.577 --> 20:56.820
But between these pages lies the key
to the salvation of the race.

20:57.041 --> 21:02.119
Me myself, I am building a boat to carry
the sun people back to Africa.

21:02.965 --> 21:05.884
If you get with the programme,
you can get on the boat.

21:06.594 --> 21:09.761
You should stop by for additional
spiritual instruction.

21:10.932 --> 21:12.973
Thanks, brother. I'll do that, man.

21:13.185 --> 21:19.140
My proud black warrior,
the book costs $14.95 plus sales tax.

21:19.358 --> 21:23.191
Come on, brother! How come this
black power shit costs so much money?

21:23.864 --> 21:26.023
The revolution must be marketed.

21:27.994 --> 21:29.571
You're wastin' good money.

21:29.786 --> 21:32.954
I'm investing in my spirituality.
You need to do the same.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.835
The only thing I need
to invest in is getting paid.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.592
Shit!

21:42.802 --> 21:44.344
What's up, sweetness?

21:45.430 --> 21:48.764
Hi. I'm Sissy.

21:48.977 --> 21:50.303
S-S-S-S...

21:50.519 --> 21:51.633
The one and only.

21:51.854 --> 21:54.523
I done heard your name
on the lips of many rappers.

21:54.733 --> 21:57.141
That's how I like it.

21:57.361 --> 22:01.488
- Like what?
- Me on a lot of rappers' lips.

22:02.908 --> 22:05.280
I'm a businessman,
and this is a business.

22:05.494 --> 22:07.036
Hey, Trustus.

22:07.246 --> 22:11.660
Trustus! When you gonna let us book
Wackee Dee and Sun Shine in this joint?

22:11.876 --> 22:14.201
We got the hottest spot in all Locash.

22:14.422 --> 22:17.920
I have to admit
this is a wonderful place.

22:18.133 --> 22:22.926
But what you've got to remember
is Wackee Dee is more than a rapper.

22:23.139 --> 22:25.630
Wackee Dee is an entertainer.
Right, baby?

22:25.850 --> 22:30.265
Looky here, man. I plan on givin'
a big party in this place tomorrow.

22:30.523 --> 22:33.938
You understand?
And Wackee Dee is gonna be in the house.

22:34.152 --> 22:37.569
Give me a call tomorrow.
We can talk about it.

22:39.366 --> 22:42.866
Punk! All these record company punks
is a bunch of bitches.

22:43.078 --> 22:44.074
Bitches.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.410
Damn!

22:48.626 --> 22:53.455
I got my own personal photo gallery
of friends that I've met along the way.

22:53.673 --> 22:54.669
Oh, yeah?

22:54.882 --> 22:58.087
- Would you like to see?
- You know it.

23:02.644 --> 23:06.227
I like to photograph my friends
in a position to please.

23:06.439 --> 23:08.231
Vanilla Spice.

23:09.066 --> 23:11.106

23:14.906 --> 23:20.946
Get large, and maybe I'll let you
take a picture with me too.

23:22.290 --> 23:24.034
Maybe.

23:26.085 --> 23:28.043
Goddamn!

23:28.254 --> 23:31.955
- What you lookin' at, punk?
- Nothin'. I'm sorry.

23:33.137 --> 23:37.964
- What's your name, bitch?
- Albert. Albert Brown.

23:39.226 --> 23:43.356
Gusto, I just wanna say thanks a lot
for letting us perform here.

23:43.565 --> 23:45.639
I really appreciate it.

23:46.817 --> 23:48.228
Yeah, baby.

23:48.445 --> 23:50.438
I gots to get up in that.

23:55.203 --> 24:00.445
Silly-ass bitch. She only go out with
rappers, entertainers, shit like that.

24:00.667 --> 24:03.158
She don't know
where to get the real big dick.

24:03.378 --> 24:04.542
Big dick.

24:04.755 --> 24:09.881
Excuse me, Gusto. If Wackee Dee plays
here, could we be the opening act?

24:11.179 --> 24:13.302
- You dismissed.
- Come on, man.

24:13.514 --> 24:16.766
- We're gettin' our shit together...
- When I say "go" you go.

24:16.978 --> 24:19.136
Yo, what's going on?
What's up, man?

24:20.063 --> 24:22.769
What, your posse
'spose to be deep now?

24:26.030 --> 24:27.937
Brother, you seem easily upset.

24:35.414 --> 24:36.411
Damn!

24:39.169 --> 24:42.087
- Shit.
- I should fuck you up!

24:42.297 --> 24:43.578
Damn.

24:47.137 --> 24:49.806
You better have some cash.

24:50.014 --> 24:51.925
Come on, look.

24:53.478 --> 24:56.810
Fellas, come here! Let me talk to you.

24:57.023 --> 25:01.483
Look, you guys can rap,
but you got nothin' I can sell.

25:01.694 --> 25:04.186
If you get it together, give me a call.

25:05.574 --> 25:08.327
- Where were we?
- What's up, baby?

25:08.536 --> 25:11.537
You know who that was?
That was Trustus Jones!

25:11.747 --> 25:14.321
Trustus Jones,
the motherfuckin' mogul of rap!

25:14.542 --> 25:17.745
That's fine. Maybe in the future,
we can tap that resource.

25:17.962 --> 25:20.206
Right now we got
a very serious problem.

25:20.425 --> 25:24.886
Gusto's is the only place in Locash that
showcases rap. We need to get back in.

25:25.096 --> 25:28.762
You gotta take your Slim-Fast ass
back in there and apologise.

25:28.976 --> 25:31.135
- I don't wanna go in there.
- C'mon, man.

25:31.352 --> 25:33.262
Now, man. C'mon.

25:37.610 --> 25:38.606
Bitch!

25:40.573 --> 25:43.987
Tomorrow. Tomorrow, all right?

25:45.661 --> 25:48.745
"Now, listen, motherfucker.
I'm runnin' shit."

25:48.956 --> 25:50.238
Nope. He'll kill me.

25:50.459 --> 25:53.744
"Gusto, you need us, baby."
Nope. He'll slap me.

25:53.962 --> 25:57.663
"Check this out. I'm here to kiss
your ass. Show me where to pucker up."

25:57.883 --> 25:58.915
He's gonna kill me.

25:59.135 --> 26:03.179
Hope this shit is better than last time.
My name's attached to this shit.

26:04.349 --> 26:06.010
- It's good.
- Yeah, it's good.

26:06.226 --> 26:09.926
40 Dog, get on the door.
Show him the cash.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.933
That's enough for five birds.
Let's see 'em.

26:22.203 --> 26:26.282
- Hey, you got the time?
- Sure, 3.00.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.099
- No!
- Who the fuck is that?

26:49.317 --> 26:52.602
- Don't worry. That kid, Albert.
- What the fuck does he want?

26:52.821 --> 26:55.277
Probably just wanna kiss your ass!

26:55.491 --> 26:58.325
He is an ass-kissin' motherfucker.
It's cool.

26:59.078 --> 27:00.620
Ass-kickin' motherfucker!

27:05.086 --> 27:07.658
Hi, Mr 40 Dog.

27:07.879 --> 27:10.584
I was just wonderin'
if Gusto were around.

27:10.800 --> 27:15.712
Remember where it comes from,
who gets that kind of cash in Locash.

27:15.931 --> 27:19.263
- Gusto, how's it go?
- Freeze! Get down now!

27:19.475 --> 27:22.264
Freeze! Get down! Freeze!

27:23.147 --> 27:24.939
You too!

27:26.734 --> 27:29.985
- Well, happy birthday, Gusto.
- My birthday was last week.

27:30.197 --> 27:32.605
I wanted you to have
something to celebrate.

27:32.825 --> 27:35.495
- Fake-ass Bruce Willis.
- You can let him go.

27:35.704 --> 27:38.573
- He's OK.
- You set me up?

27:39.206 --> 27:43.039
- You set me up?
- I saw him talking to the cops.

27:43.254 --> 27:46.290
You dead, bitch. Better buy
a black dress for your mama.

27:46.507 --> 27:49.923
- Cell Block 4 is waiting.
- Ain't nothin' but brick and steel.

27:50.260 --> 27:52.718
That can't hold Gusto.
That can't hold Gusto!

27:53.055 --> 27:55.547
Gusto! Gusto! Gusto!

27:59.396 --> 28:01.305
[cop] Stay back!

28:09.949 --> 28:12.156
Let's go. Bring him out here.

28:12.369 --> 28:14.861
Gusto! Gusto! Gusto!

28:23.799 --> 28:25.258
I'm gonna get you, punk.

28:25.468 --> 28:29.418
Think it's over?
You embarrassed me like this?

28:29.640 --> 28:31.846
Gusto! Gusto! Gusto!

28:32.058 --> 28:35.973
<i>[Albert] Now, Gusto was no Nino Brown,
but he was large in Locash.</i>

28:36.189 --> 28:39.938
<i>When I heard them chant his name,
I figured he won't need it anytime soon.</i>

28:41.610 --> 28:44.696
- Brother, I don't know, man.
- Listen to me.

28:44.907 --> 28:49.485
We take Gusto's image,
make ourselves into hard-core rappers.

28:49.704 --> 28:52.112
Then we take stories from Gusto's life.

28:52.330 --> 28:55.286
- Get Trustus Jones to handle us.
- I ain't with it.

28:55.501 --> 28:58.954
- I'm the only one taking a real risk.
- How's that?

28:59.172 --> 29:02.589
Cos from now on
I'll be known as MC Gusto.

29:03.678 --> 29:07.012
We'll be Cell Block 4,
after the joint they threw Gusto in.

29:07.224 --> 29:10.676
You buggin'? You couldn't
pick a name besides that nigga Gusto?

29:10.938 --> 29:13.937
"Nigga"? You already
becomin' a gangster!

29:14.148 --> 29:17.435
No, cousin, I can't let you go
out like that. I'm not havin' it.

29:17.652 --> 29:21.485
- I say we vote on it, and I vote yes.
- I vote no three times.

29:21.699 --> 29:24.190
You only get one vote.
Otis, how you feel?

29:24.409 --> 29:27.245
Otis, you and I both
know it's suicide, man.

29:28.831 --> 29:32.367
Otis, what about Sissy?
Think about Sissy.

29:32.586 --> 29:36.250
I know you want to get in there. Sissy.

29:37.884 --> 29:41.050
That's it.
Assume the position, baby.

29:41.805 --> 29:43.085
I vote yes.

29:44.934 --> 29:47.970
- I wouldn't mind being large a minute.
- What you gonna do?

29:48.187 --> 29:51.188
It's crazy, crazy shit!

29:51.398 --> 29:56.107
Yo, listen. Excuse me, man.
Do you work in radio?

29:56.320 --> 30:00.402
- No, nigga.
- Wait a minute. An answering service?

30:00.617 --> 30:02.656
No, nigga.
Eat your big-ass biscuit.

30:02.870 --> 30:06.535
Hey, it don't have to be about all that.
It's your speaking voice.

30:06.749 --> 30:08.826
It's so... familiar.

30:11.422 --> 30:15.372
- Yeah.
- You brothers is all I got. I'm in!

30:15.594 --> 30:19.176
But I gotta tell you, if I get
something better to do, I'm steppin'.

30:19.389 --> 30:24.300
Nigga, please! We're gonna be so large,
make so much money, get so many girlies.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.308
By the time Gusto gets out ofjail,
we'll be so large,

30:27.522 --> 30:30.441
we'll write him a cheque
and tell him to chill.

30:30.651 --> 30:32.396
We can't be so exploitive, now.

30:32.612 --> 30:35.233
- No question!
- Cousin!

[Trustus] OK, guys, I love the image.

31:13.367 --> 31:15.609
But let me ask you one thing.

31:16.537 --> 31:20.700
Are you sure you wanna be Gusto? Why not
something like Ice Pick, Ice Coffee?

31:20.916 --> 31:23.243
- "Ice" is happening now.
- "Ice" my dick.

31:23.461 --> 31:25.205
We're Cell Block 4
and I'm Gusto.

31:25.422 --> 31:28.923
- Take it or leave it.
- All right, guys. Let's get started.

31:30.137 --> 31:34.514
So I want you to sign with us
and you want to sign with us.

31:35.517 --> 31:40.098
We want you to want to sign with us.
Let me ask you a couple of questions.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.983
- Do you cuss on your records?
- Yeah.

31:43.192 --> 31:46.609
- Do you defile women with your lyrics?
- Yeah.

31:47.448 --> 31:48.823
Do you...

31:50.827 --> 31:52.984
...fondle your genitalia on stage?

31:53.203 --> 31:54.996
- Yeah.
- Whenever possible.

31:57.333 --> 32:01.414
Do you glorify violence
or advocate the use of guns

32:01.631 --> 32:04.631
as a way of solving a civil dispute?
OK, final question.

32:04.841 --> 32:06.716
Do you respect anything at all?

32:06.927 --> 32:08.671
Not a goddamn thing.

32:09.765 --> 32:12.766
You've got a deal!
Welcome to the family.

a damn" hip-hop attitude. It's so real.

- Hey, excuse me.
- What's up, baby? How can I help you?

33:47.960 --> 33:52.254
I know you were hooked into the prison
seeing that you're from Cell Block 4.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.622
Yeah, I was runnin' shit up at CB4.

33:54.842 --> 33:59.255
I had a brother up at Folsom. He was
smoked by The Black Guerrilla Family.

They didn't have to leave him like that!

Baa Baa Ack the respect due him.

- It's Gusto, got it?
- That's exactly my point.

34:43.313 --> 34:47.858
None of this is real, so we got
to stay grounded in reality.

34:48.110 --> 34:52.572

about as fake as a bitch's hair weave.

- I gots to go first.
- Why you disrespect this sister?

35:07.884 --> 35:09.426
She just a groupie with a pen.

A pen is all you have in
your pants, it's out of ink.

35:12.389 --> 35:14.180
- Watch it, ho!
- Ho?

35:14.390 --> 35:18.140
This is not Christmas,
you slender slice of sexist slime,

35:18.353 --> 35:22.352
and I am not a girlie, a videho,
a skeezer, a prop, a hoochie or a stunt.

35:22.567 --> 35:25.686
And most certainly not a ho. Comprende?

35:26.279 --> 35:28.236
Princess is no joke!

35:28.449 --> 35:32.068
- Thank you, Euripides.
- It's my pleasure, sister Edwards.

35:32.287 --> 35:35.038
No, please, call me Eve.

35:35.247 --> 35:37.953
- You know...
- I am not a groupie.

35:38.168 --> 35:41.537
I am a journalist.
I take no shorts and I do my research.

35:41.756 --> 35:45.753
I can do a nice puffy feature
that reports exactly what you tell me,

35:45.968 --> 35:50.631
or I can delve so deeply
into your background

35:50.849 --> 35:53.471
with an eye for every inconsistency,

35:53.686 --> 35:57.351
your mother would disavow
any knowledge of your birth.

35:57.565 --> 36:03.070
Now, which would you prefer, Albert?

36:07.492 --> 36:10.162

36:16.920 --> 36:21.713
My left breast was prominently
featured in Eric B's last video.

36:21.926 --> 36:24.132
This video exposure is too come-and-go.

36:24.346 --> 36:27.511
What you need to do
is get yourself a Polaroid Instamatic.

36:28.140 --> 36:30.597
You see this watch?

36:30.811 --> 36:33.481
This is what the right picture
of the right man

36:33.689 --> 36:35.897

36:36.110 --> 36:39.063

we gotta go, gotta go.

36:39.278 --> 36:41.486
Yeah, we work for a livin'.

36:41.698 --> 36:44.272
You gonna keep workin',
the rate you goin'.

36:44.492 --> 36:49.488
It's fine and dandy to go out with these
guys and to drive around in their car,

36:49.707 --> 36:52.412
and have them take you
to an expensive restaurant.

36:52.627 --> 36:56.792
But if all you get out of it
is a fuck, then you's a ho.

36:58.758 --> 37:02.674
But you get yourself
a fabulous motor vehicle,

37:02.889 --> 37:07.304
a fine house and can afford
to pay for your own meals,

37:07.520 --> 37:10.141

37:39.848 --> 37:41.223

39:55.126 --> 39:56.158
Hey, Dad, CB4!

39:57.463 --> 40:00.036
Billings, I've got
all this paper in front of me.

40:00.257 --> 40:02.547
Charts, graphs, the works.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.963
What's the bottom line?
Am I gonna win?

40:06.181 --> 40:08.257
<i>Of course you're gonna winl</i>

40:08.476 --> 40:11.511
<i>But your only hope is to
create some kind of media event.</i>

40:11.729 --> 40:14.434
- Daddy!
- A media event? What do you mean?

40:16.985 --> 40:20.188
Dad! Daddy! Hello! This is CB4.

40:20.405 --> 40:23.276
Ben! It's just my kid.
Go ahead.

40:26.829 --> 40:28.573
Stop playin' me like a sucker.

40:28.790 --> 40:31.576
I want my CB4, you hear me?

40:31.793 --> 40:33.335
<i># Cos you're goin'on a long hike</i>

40:33.545 --> 40:35.419
<i># Off a cliff, I'm drivin'you over</i>

<i># Now you're there

<i># I'm the nigga waitin'for you

40:44.974 --> 40:46.766
<i># A bullet in the head

40:49.313 --> 40:50.937
<i># It's ten o'clock
Do you know where your momma's at?</i>

40:51.150 --> 40:53.306
I might have something.

40:55.695 --> 40:57.439
<i># Straight outta Locash</i>

41:01.410 --> 41:03.319
<i>Yo, this is MC Gusto of Cell Block 4.</i>

41:03.536 --> 41:06.492
<i>Tonight we're performing
at the Jackson Theatre.</i>

41:06.749 --> 41:07.948
Those motherfuckers!

41:13.299 --> 41:17.166
Look at this punk! He's walkin'
like me. He's tryin' to be me!

41:17.386 --> 41:21.551
I didn't know you do rap records, Gusto!
That's bad, man.

41:21.767 --> 41:25.300
That ain't him.
Stop bein' ignorant.

41:26.105 --> 41:30.483
Bust a little rhyme for me, man.
Come on! Go, go!

41:30.694 --> 41:34.940
Look, man, there's only one Gusto
and he ain't no rapper!

41:45.001 --> 41:47.836
That was a brand-new single
from Cell Block 4,

41:48.046 --> 41:51.498
<i>CB4 for those who know,
from their album Straight Outta Locash.</i>

41:51.717 --> 41:57.056
Why don't you holler at my
WWWW listeners? Give 'em a holler.

41:57.264 --> 41:59.637
Yo, what's up to the hard core?

42:00.561 --> 42:04.808
Peace to all the Nubians filled
with the new black consciousness.

42:05.025 --> 42:08.809
Yeah, the darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice.

42:09.029 --> 42:11.816
I'm lovin' this.
Why don't we go to the phone lines,

42:12.032 --> 42:15.946
talk to some brothers, let them
get to know you straight up in person?

42:16.162 --> 42:18.118
We got Susan from Gardena.

42:18.331 --> 42:20.371
Why don't you holler at CB4?

42:20.583 --> 42:23.040
<i>This question's for Dead Mike.</i>

42:23.253 --> 42:26.124
<i>I was reading Right On.
Your birthday's comin' up.</i>

42:26.340 --> 42:29.009
<i>I was wondering,
what's your favourite dessert?</i>

42:30.845 --> 42:32.755
Sister, my sister.

42:32.972 --> 42:37.053
It is uplifting to know
that a sister such as yourself

42:37.269 --> 42:39.725
still takes pride in her race.

42:39.939 --> 42:43.984
It's ice cream. Did you know
a black man invented ice cream?

42:44.194 --> 42:49.863
No, no! How the hell a black man gonna
invent ice cream in hot-ass Africa?

42:50.074 --> 42:52.567
- Tell me that.
- Ice cream, Africa.

42:52.787 --> 42:55.908
That's a great concept, guys.
I'm liking that. Next call.

42:56.124 --> 42:58.911
<i>[Gusto] OK, I got a question
for this so-called Gusto.</i>

42:59.126 --> 43:02.212
<i>If you set someone up
for the police then stole his name,</i>

43:02.423 --> 43:04.000
<i>didn't even say "excuse me",</i>

43:04.217 --> 43:08.085
<i>wouldn't you expect the injured party
to bust out of jail, hunt you down</i>

43:08.305 --> 43:11.175
<i>- and beat you like the dog you are?
- Nah!</i>

43:11.851 --> 43:14.970
The chickens have come home to roost.

43:17.482 --> 43:19.190
Open C block, comin' up.

43:20.818 --> 43:24.105
- [inmate 1] Hey, baby.
- [inmate 2] Single file, girls.

43:27.034 --> 43:28.446
Walk.

43:28.662 --> 43:30.487
[inmate] Girls.

43:32.540 --> 43:34.283
What are you doin'?

43:34.501 --> 43:36.577
I'm gettin' us outta here. Be quiet!

43:48.475 --> 43:50.634
- I'm in this one.
- You gonna have to go!

43:51.937 --> 43:53.645
Get in there.

44:06.287 --> 44:08.860
Man, you crazy with that
"I don't eat pork" shit.

44:09.081 --> 44:12.201
Personally, I'll eat a pig's ass
if they cook it right.

44:12.419 --> 44:15.504
Beloved, it's against
everything I now believe.

44:15.715 --> 44:19.083
You see, pork is the white man,

44:19.302 --> 44:21.924
and the white man is pork.

44:22.138 --> 44:26.053
If you spell "white man" backwards
what does it spell? Pork!

44:27.060 --> 44:30.680
If you can't see that,
they've got you brainwashed, brother.

44:30.899 --> 44:34.314
I must be brainwashed then.
You mean to tell me

44:34.526 --> 44:38.821
if you was thrown outta your apartment
and a pig offered to pay your rent,

44:39.033 --> 44:41.025
- you wouldn't take the money?
- No.

44:41.244 --> 44:44.659
Shit. I'd be
a-money takin' from a pig.

44:44.871 --> 44:47.364
That's the difference
between you and me.

44:47.584 --> 44:49.742
I got a place
and you live with your mother.

44:57.845 --> 45:00.881
Would you stop it? Albert!

45:01.100 --> 45:03.971
- Just a sip.
- I'm gonna smack you.

45:04.896 --> 45:07.136
Shit. More for me then.

45:08.025 --> 45:11.144
Albert, I don't like this scene.

45:11.361 --> 45:14.031
I definitely don't like
what's happening to you.

45:14.239 --> 45:19.116
Just because I got a little bit of cash,
why does everybody gotta start buggin'?

45:19.328 --> 45:21.997
No, no. We are not bugging.

45:22.206 --> 45:26.122
It's you who better take a look
in the mirror, Mr MC Gusto.

45:27.753 --> 45:30.958
You are not the sensitive man
you used to be.

45:31.175 --> 45:34.045
<i>- [romantic music]
- # I'm in love...</i>

45:35.681 --> 45:37.802
[Albert] Daliha!

45:43.898 --> 45:45.725
[gunshot, Albert screams]

45:46.109 --> 45:48.813
Give it to me! Albert!

45:49.653 --> 45:51.861
That girl is too wholesome.

45:52.074 --> 45:54.114
She's messin' with our program.

45:54.326 --> 45:59.035
Sissy, I want you to get in as many
pictures as possible with MC Gusto,

45:59.248 --> 46:01.491
kissin' him, huggin' him, whatever.

46:01.709 --> 46:04.829
- I planned on doin' that anyway.
- No, no, baby,

46:05.047 --> 46:07.503
I mean, with a
professional photographer.

46:07.718 --> 46:11.964
You should be what
Cell Block 4's all about.

46:12.930 --> 46:15.636
If I could just add
a personal note at this point.

46:15.851 --> 46:19.019
This was the year
when I first discovered CB4.

46:19.229 --> 46:23.773
Well, you three have been
inside my head ever since.

46:23.985 --> 46:27.272
- That's my personal thank you.
- You're very welcome.

46:27.490 --> 46:29.814
<i>[Albert] I only wish everyone
felt that way.</i>

46:30.034 --> 46:31.575
[applause]

46:31.785 --> 46:37.076
The home is the most important
institution in American life.

46:37.292 --> 46:41.241
It's our castle in a world
of demons and dragons.

46:41.463 --> 46:45.925
Since the mysterious
death of my wife,

46:46.135 --> 46:49.505
my son Ben and I had
bonded together in our home.

46:49.723 --> 46:53.055
I say "had"
because through rap music,

46:53.268 --> 46:56.720
evil influences invaded our castle,

46:56.939 --> 47:02.278
representatives of a demon culture
that must be stopped at all costs!

47:03.738 --> 47:07.523
Any person who'd
defile America's pastime

47:07.743 --> 47:10.947
by wearing a baseball cap backwards,

47:11.165 --> 47:13.785
well, that's an evil
that speaks for itself.

47:13.999 --> 47:16.041
[loud horn]

47:24.178 --> 47:29.091
See! See how those demons
have poisoned my seed!

47:29.309 --> 47:31.386
Ben! Ben!

47:34.898 --> 47:36.179
Ben!

47:36.401 --> 47:38.857
Ben! Come here, son!

47:41.114 --> 47:44.317
To some people, these fools
out here could be a problem.

47:44.535 --> 47:46.492
Bad for the image,
bad for sales.

47:46.705 --> 47:51.948
But you, brothers,
have created something so nasty,

47:52.169 --> 47:55.170
so vile, that the iller you get,
the better off we are.

47:55.463 --> 47:59.296
- Now go out there and have a good time.
- No problem.

47:59.511 --> 48:01.966
By the way,
I almost forgot to tell you.

48:02.181 --> 48:03.805
Gusto escaped from prison.

48:04.016 --> 48:07.016
He has vowed to dismember
everybody in the group.

48:07.227 --> 48:08.224
Knock 'em dead.

48:10.313 --> 48:12.806
Get back! Get back!

48:14.153 --> 48:15.978
Trustus? Trustus, hi.

48:16.196 --> 48:19.565
- Hi, Eve. I love the piece you did.
- You should thank Dead Mike.

48:19.783 --> 48:22.820
You aware they might be
arrested for indecency tonight?

48:23.038 --> 48:26.370
Cell Block 4 is not afraid to go
to jail. Cell Block 4 is from jail!

48:26.582 --> 48:29.953
It would be like sendin' 'em home!
Sissy? Baby, where are ya?

48:30.170 --> 48:32.079
There you are.

48:32.548 --> 48:35.632
Can I have your autograph?
Yeah, yeah, little kiddie.

48:35.844 --> 48:38.879
Stab Master, CB4.

48:39.096 --> 48:41.504
- Keep it as a souvenir.
- Thanks.

48:41.725 --> 48:44.643
- Let's go, baby.
- Come on, Dad. It's only an...

48:46.856 --> 48:49.691
Hey, hey, wait. Who is this?

48:49.901 --> 48:53.353
- She looks too cute to be your woman.
- Remember what time it is!

48:53.571 --> 48:57.025
- She's my cousin, my cousin.
- What?

48:58.159 --> 49:00.069
Are you OK?

49:04.584 --> 49:06.377
Man, look at this funky asshole.

49:06.587 --> 49:10.999
That bitch wouldn't give me the time
of day because I wasn't an entertainer,

49:11.217 --> 49:13.091
because I wasn't a star.

49:13.303 --> 49:16.424
Don't the bitch know that
we're the motherfuckin' stars?

49:16.640 --> 49:18.633
That's all right.

49:18.850 --> 49:21.971
Because now I'm gonna get
paid off from them. You know how?

49:22.187 --> 49:24.394
Pimp 'em like
the bitches that they are.

49:24.607 --> 49:26.267
Pimp them motherfuckin' hos.

49:27.944 --> 49:30.020
<i>[Albert] With Daliha out of the picture,</i>

49:30.238 --> 49:32.315

was all about.</i>

And we're one spot behind Wackee Dee.
Takin' out all that rap.

- I'm glad you happy, cos I'm not.
- Man, what's your beef?

52:47.922 --> 52:52.464
All this gangster mess, man.
People protestin'. That ain't for me.

52:52.676 --> 52:55.049
I like the music.
I like the fly-ass girlies.

52:55.262 --> 52:57.932
I also like when I help
my sisters around the house.

In my role as head of the Sacramento
City Council's Board of Decency,

I, Virgil Robinson,
am here to inform you that:

53:21.210 --> 53:25.457
"Under penalty of arrest
you cannot touch your genitalia.

53:25.672 --> 53:29.173
The word 'ho' can only be used
in reference to a garden tool.

53:29.385 --> 53:32.800
The word 'bitch' may only be used
when describing female dogs,

53:33.013 --> 53:35.054
and then only when in heat.

53:35.267 --> 53:38.185
The word 'blow job' can only
be used in describing a job

blowing up balloons
or children's animals."

the head off a pigeon, nothin' happen?

56:50.196 --> 56:53.731
I'm gettin' ready to go to jail
for a song about the sweat of my balls.

57:26.029 --> 57:28.782
Now, I may be in here
for malicious acts,

57:28.991 --> 57:31.030
I do have a sensitive side.

57:31.243 --> 57:33.817
So I'd like to read you
a poem. It's called

57:34.039 --> 57:37.039
- "I didn't do it".
- My man got a poem.

57:37.250 --> 57:42.672
"Just because I had the cash
doesn't mean I killed his ass.

57:42.881 --> 57:44.424
I didn't do it.

57:44.634 --> 57:47.837
Just because
the blood was in my hand

57:48.053 --> 57:49.882
doesn't mean I stabbed the man.

57:50.099 --> 57:51.343
I didn't do it."

57:51.558 --> 57:53.515
[footsteps]

58:23.261 --> 58:24.838
All right, all right!

58:25.055 --> 58:29.218
Welcome to the post-arrest conference
for the world's most dangerous band,

58:29.434 --> 58:30.465
CB4!

58:30.685 --> 58:34.934
- Yeah, they couldn't keep us in!
- All right, first question.

58:35.149 --> 58:38.484
<i>My name is Malik from the
Tan City Sun and I'd like to know</i>

58:38.696 --> 58:40.983
what you so-called brothers are doing

58:41.197 --> 58:43.868
to uplift the community
in economic terms.

58:44.076 --> 58:46.863
Man, I'm tired of these
black questions, man.

58:47.079 --> 58:49.750
Ask Michael J Fox
what he's doin' for the yuppies?

58:49.957 --> 58:53.328
Ask Sylvester Stallone
what he's doin' for the Italians?

58:53.546 --> 58:58.374
Brother, I'd like it to be known that I
am reinvesting in the black community.

58:58.593 --> 59:01.130
I am opening a chain
of beeper supply stores

59:01.470 --> 59:06.347
in Locash that will employ only
our disenfranchised black youth.

59:06.561 --> 59:09.515
MC Gusto,
my African-American women readers

59:09.732 --> 59:12.517
would like to know why
you refer to women as bitches.

59:12.733 --> 59:17.479
Yo, women, bitches, hos...
people with pussies.

59:18.031 --> 59:19.526
I love the pussy people.

59:19.742 --> 59:22.908
- Pussy for everybody.
- Yeah, pussies!

59:23.119 --> 59:24.781
- Know what I'm sayin'?
- I do not

59:24.998 --> 59:28.747
and neither would anyone with
respect for the English language.

59:28.960 --> 59:30.669
- Next question.
- Excuse me.

59:30.881 --> 59:33.796
In protest of our arrest
by the powers that be,

59:34.008 --> 59:37.793
we will answer no questions
from the white media!

59:38.012 --> 59:41.845
- Let's go.
- Press conference over!

59:50.026 --> 59:52.601
Well, that's the story so far.

59:52.821 --> 59:56.688
This is just incredible. It's amazing.

59:56.909 --> 01:00:00.528
Well, to use your words,
it's "all that".

01:00:00.746 --> 01:00:04.697
- It's gonna make a great video.
- I wouldn't unload my camera just yet.

01:00:04.917 --> 01:00:07.042
I still gotta deal with Gusto.

01:00:13.345 --> 01:00:14.624
- Later.
- All right.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.883
This bitch is really from the ghetto.

01:00:20.102 --> 01:00:22.807
Don't look like the ghetto to me, boss.

01:00:23.064 --> 01:00:25.554
"The smallest dog in
the world is the Chihuahua.

01:00:25.774 --> 01:00:28.812
It is named for a city in Mexico
where it became popular."

01:00:29.237 --> 01:00:32.737
Shut up, girl. You just think
you so smart cos you can read.

01:00:33.993 --> 01:00:35.536
Hey, baby!

01:00:35.744 --> 01:00:39.196
Give your grandma a big kiss!

01:00:39.416 --> 01:00:42.204
- So how you doin', Grandma?
- How you doin'?

01:00:42.419 --> 01:00:46.666
I heard you just broke out of the joint.
I didn't even know you was in there.

01:00:46.881 --> 01:00:48.756
It was just an overnight thing.

01:00:48.968 --> 01:00:52.053
Is the conjugal room still green?

01:00:52.764 --> 01:00:55.470
I wouldn't know about that.
It was just overnight.

01:00:55.685 --> 01:00:57.392
Mmm, you oughta know.

01:01:01.942 --> 01:01:06.236
- Hi, D.
- Hey, Albert. How was jail?

01:01:06.446 --> 01:01:11.155
Look, Daliha, that whole
cousin thing, I was wrong.

01:01:11.369 --> 01:01:16.578
I would never try
to hurt you, D. I love you.

01:01:16.792 --> 01:01:18.415
Look, I got you somethin'.

01:01:30.514 --> 01:01:34.976
Great. I'm sure that
Sissy girl would love these.

01:01:49.162 --> 01:01:50.785
Hey, there's a party inside.

01:01:52.665 --> 01:01:56.165
Your mother may have
time for a party, but me,

01:01:56.378 --> 01:02:00.045
- I got bills to pay.
- Why don't you take this to a carwash?

01:02:00.257 --> 01:02:02.832
We don't have money to take
the car to the carwash

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:05.508
every time it gets a little smudge.

01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:08.094
We ain't all big-time
rap stars like you.

01:02:13.814 --> 01:02:16.270
Son, what's on your mind?

01:02:16.484 --> 01:02:18.857
I work to get us
into a nice house like this,

01:02:19.071 --> 01:02:21.111
and you pretend to be a crook.

01:02:21.322 --> 01:02:22.983
- What, you ashamed of me?
- No.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.735
Why you go runnin' around
with gold-tooth, greasy-ass hair,

01:02:26.955 --> 01:02:31.285
holdin' yourjohnson like it's the
only one God created? You ain't tough.

01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:36.128
There are some real kids out there
who are gonna kick your narrow ass!

01:02:36.339 --> 01:02:39.009
You ain't from the street.
I'm from the street!

01:02:39.218 --> 01:02:43.050
And only somebody who wasn't
would think it was something to glorify!

01:02:48.604 --> 01:02:50.894
[40 Dog] That's a pretty little thing.

01:02:56.071 --> 01:02:58.741
This bitch got all the bitches.

01:03:17.137 --> 01:03:20.173
We was just readin'
about you, bitch!

01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:25.061
You know, your Ready-Rooter, funky-ass
truck-driving father was right.

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:28.474
You ought to be ashamed of
yourself taking advantage of me.

01:03:28.691 --> 01:03:30.400
Gusto?

01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:34.609
Boy, I'm three generations
deep in gangsterdom.

01:03:34.823 --> 01:03:36.530
Three generations!

01:03:39.537 --> 01:03:41.779
Albert, are you in there?

01:03:42.499 --> 01:03:45.251
And your woman?
She's real fine, you know.

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.786
I'd like to fuck her froggy style.

01:03:48.004 --> 01:03:50.757
- [Daliha] What did you say?
- I'll be out in a while.

01:03:50.967 --> 01:03:52.591
OK.

01:03:53.802 --> 01:03:58.097
- Tryin' to protect that ass?
- Protect that ass!

01:03:58.307 --> 01:04:01.974
- Welcome to the terrordome, bitch.
- Terrordome, bitch.

01:04:14.368 --> 01:04:16.576
What are you gonna do?

01:04:17.414 --> 01:04:20.783
- You want to be a gangster, right?
- Gangster.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.792
Come on, get out the car.

01:04:28.093 --> 01:04:32.221
Y'all know the routine. Yeah!
Get them goddamn clothes off!

01:04:35.475 --> 01:04:36.556
Do what he says.

01:04:36.769 --> 01:04:40.304
Mister, yo! Put your clothes back on!
CB4 is in the house!

01:04:40.522 --> 01:04:42.849
CB4! You know what I'm sayin'?

01:04:43.068 --> 01:04:46.603
- Get on the ground!
- [man] Don't shoot us.

01:04:46.822 --> 01:04:49.608
Stay on the goddamn ground!
You, get out there, man!

01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:53.571
Get over there, man, get over there.
Get on the ground, move.

Shut up, man.

01:06:12.795 --> 01:06:15.166
Now CB4 is over or you're dead.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:17.338
40 Dog, get rid of this trash, man.

01:06:19.635 --> 01:06:20.750
Punk!

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:28.889
I'm callin' this private,
emergency meeting.

01:06:29.104 --> 01:06:33.055
I've had it with how sloppy
you two have become.

01:06:33.278 --> 01:06:35.351
- What you talkin' about?
- Shut up.

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:38.774
You don't say the words
the way you're supposed to.

01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:41.363
You're too spiritual
to rock the crowd.

01:06:41.577 --> 01:06:45.492
And Otis, you used to be
the coolest virgin in the world.

01:06:45.706 --> 01:06:50.001
But now that you got a little pussy,
your mixing has fallen the fuck off.

01:06:50.212 --> 01:06:53.747
Gusto broke out ofjail, but that
ain't no reason for you to be buggin.

01:06:53.967 --> 01:06:55.924
- Shit.
- I'm not buggin'.

01:06:56.136 --> 01:06:59.053
I called this private meetin'
and look what happened!

01:07:00.056 --> 01:07:03.639
Hey, brothers, calm down.

01:07:06.148 --> 01:07:08.768
- You ain't fuckin' up on purpose?
- What?

01:07:08.982 --> 01:07:12.352
You and Bubba Ack wanna go solo.

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:15.110
But damn, nigga, don't sabotage CB4.

01:07:15.324 --> 01:07:18.858
Don't be so selfish, man.
You wanna step off, step the fuck off!

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:22.080
I don't know why you want me
to knock you out, but so be it!

01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:24.412
- What you want, man?
- Yo, you're fired!

01:07:24.626 --> 01:07:27.200
You can't fire me.
Vote me out like I was voted in!

01:07:27.422 --> 01:07:28.915
Otis, throw his ass out!

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:30.674
- Fuck this.
- Otis?

01:07:30.883 --> 01:07:34.252
All I wanted to do was make music
and hang out with women.

01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:37.222
When y'all get your
shit straight, come see me.

01:07:37.433 --> 01:07:39.389
That's it! Cell Block 4 is through.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.353
You're free to buy
that fool his boat back to Africa.

01:07:42.563 --> 01:07:44.935
You did this on purpose, didn't ya?

01:07:46.484 --> 01:07:47.729
I'm outta here, man.

01:07:53.242 --> 01:07:57.490
Here we go again. Weird Warren's
Video V-V-V-V-Video Countdown.

01:07:57.706 --> 01:08:01.536
Word on the street
is CB4, null and void?

01:08:01.751 --> 01:08:05.535
MC Gusto spotted in a record store,
armed robbery? What?

01:08:05.756 --> 01:08:09.457
<i>This hasn't stopped the rest of the

is even blacker than themselves.

of cultural overthrow
