00:34.531 --> 00:38.232
- Look at those pine trees.
- And that lake.

00:39.870 --> 00:42.195
I swear that's honeysuckle I smell.

00:42.372 --> 00:45.991
I swear that's a little orange blossom
thrown in.

00:46.168 --> 00:47.912
It's unbelievable.

00:48.087 --> 00:53.081
Growth exactly like that of Earth
on a planet half a galaxy away.

00:53.259 --> 00:55.335
What are the odds
of such duplication?

00:55.511 --> 00:56.792
Astronomical, captain.

00:56.971 --> 00:59.676
The relative size, age
and composition of this planet

00:59.849 --> 01:03.384
makes it highly improbable
that it would evolve similarly to Earth

01:03.561 --> 01:05.138
in any way.

01:07.899 --> 01:09.274
What in blazes is that?

01:12.320 --> 01:15.274
- Analysis, Spock?
- An alien metal of some kind.

01:15.448 --> 01:18.699
An alloy resistant to probe.

01:18.869 --> 01:22.617
Readings can't even
measure its age accurately.

01:27.461 --> 01:31.459
These incised symbols are fascinating,
evidently some form of writing.

01:31.632 --> 01:35.582
- Any theories about what it is?
- Negative, captain,

01:35.761 --> 01:37.635
but structures of this complexity

01:37.805 --> 01:40.426
require extremely sophisticated
building apparatus,

01:40.599 --> 01:45.143
the kind usually found in cultures
surpassing or equalling our own.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.807
Meadows and no meteor craters.

01:46.981 --> 01:49.650
The whole place is an enigma,
biologically and culturally.

01:49.817 --> 01:53.186
What's the nearest concentration
of life forms, Mr. Spock?

01:57.075 --> 02:00.989
Bearing 117, mark 4.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.993
And how much time did you say
we have to investigate?

02:04.166 --> 02:07.582
If we are to divert the asteroid which
is on a collision course with this planet,

02:07.753 --> 02:10.078
we must warp out of orbit
within 30 minutes.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.829
Every second we delay
arriving at the deflection point

02:13.008 --> 02:16.258
compounds the problem,
perhaps past solution.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.754
You did say 30 minutes.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.182
Yes, sir.

02:23.143 --> 02:28.185
Then let's go. Let's find out what life
forms are blessed by this environment.

02:42.455 --> 02:45.207
They look like...
I'd swear they're American Indians.

02:45.375 --> 02:46.454
They are, doctor.

02:46.626 --> 02:50.375
A mixture of Navajo,
Mohican and Delaware, I believe.

02:50.547 --> 02:53.833
All among the more advanced
and peaceful tribes.

02:54.009 --> 02:58.137
It's like discovering Atlantis.
Or Shangri-la.

03:00.641 --> 03:02.550
Mr. Spock, is it possible

03:02.726 --> 03:05.846
there's a more evolved civilisation
somewhere else on this planet?

03:06.021 --> 03:10.648
One capable of building that obelisk
or developing a deflector system?

03:10.818 --> 03:12.277
Highly improbable, captain.

03:12.445 --> 03:16.063
Sensor probes indicate
only one type of life form here.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.565
Shouldn't we contact them, Jim?
Tell them?

03:19.118 --> 03:22.618
Tell them what? An asteroid's coming
to smash their world into atoms?

03:22.789 --> 03:26.205
Too primitive to grasp the concept
of space flight, doctor.

03:26.376 --> 03:30.374
Our appearance here would only serve
to confuse and frighten them.

03:30.547 --> 03:34.212
We've got a job to do.
Let's get back to the Enterprise.

03:45.228 --> 03:48.265
- What's the matter, Jim?
- What? Oh, nothing.

03:48.440 --> 03:51.394
It's just so peaceful. Uncomplicated.

03:51.568 --> 03:55.946
No problems,
no command decisions.

03:56.657 --> 03:59.611
Just living.

03:59.785 --> 04:04.282
Typical human reaction
to an idyllic natural setting.

04:04.457 --> 04:05.619
Back in the 20th century,

04:05.791 --> 04:08.543
we referred to it
as the Tahiti Syndrome.

04:08.711 --> 04:10.870
It's particularly common
to overpressured leader types,

04:11.047 --> 04:13.289
like starship captains.

04:13.466 --> 04:18.128
Tahiti Syndrome.
Let's go take care of that asteroid.

04:18.303 --> 04:20.712
But first I want another look
at that obelisk.

04:27.981 --> 04:29.641
- Doctor?
- Yes?

04:29.816 --> 04:32.058
I suggest that any further research
on your part

04:32.236 --> 04:34.809
be delayed until after
we have diverted the asteroid.

04:44.290 --> 04:45.914
- Kirk to Enterprise.
- Yes, sir.

05:14.196 --> 05:17.612
Space, the final frontier.

05:23.205 --> 05:27.369
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

05:27.543 --> 05:31.541
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

05:31.714 --> 05:35.379
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

05:35.551 --> 05:38.967
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

06:19.638 --> 06:22.094
Captain's log, stardate 4842.6.

06:22.266 --> 06:24.722
First Officer Spock commanding.

06:24.894 --> 06:26.092
Numerous search parties

06:26.270 --> 06:28.180
and repeated sensor probes
of the area

06:28.356 --> 06:31.143
have failed to locate Captain Kirk.

06:32.443 --> 06:34.851
- Spock to Enterprise.
- Enterprise. Come in, Mr. Spock.

06:35.029 --> 06:36.358
Prepare to beam us up, Mr. Scott.

06:36.531 --> 06:37.610
We're warping out of orbit.

06:37.782 --> 06:40.783
Leaving?
You can't be serious, Spock.

06:40.952 --> 06:45.531
Doctor, that asteroid is almost as large
as your Earth's moon.

06:45.707 --> 06:46.738
Far enough away,

06:46.917 --> 06:50.784
the angle necessary to divert it enough
to avoid destruction is minute.

06:50.962 --> 06:52.920
But as the asteroid
approaches this planet,

06:53.090 --> 06:56.091
the angle becomes so great
that even the power of a starship...

06:56.260 --> 06:59.296
The devil with an asteroid! It won't
get here for two months, Spock.

06:59.722 --> 07:04.265
If we arrive at the deflection point
in time, it may not get here at all.

07:04.435 --> 07:05.715
In the meantime, what about Jim?

07:05.895 --> 07:07.437
Once the asteroid
has been diverted,

07:07.605 --> 07:09.562
we'll return here
and resume the search.

07:09.732 --> 07:12.650
That may be hours from now.
He may be injured or dying.

07:16.656 --> 07:18.150
Doctor.

07:19.033 --> 07:23.742
Assume this is the planet we're on.
This is the approaching asteroid.

07:23.913 --> 07:26.072
It we don't get
to that deflection point in time,

07:26.249 --> 07:30.543
it will become physically impossible
to divert this asteroid.

07:30.712 --> 07:36.336
In that case, everyone on this planet
will die, including the captain.

07:36.510 --> 07:38.337
Can a few more minutes matter,
Spock?

07:38.512 --> 07:41.347
In the time it has taken me
to explain the problem,

07:41.515 --> 07:45.050
the asteroid has moved
from here to here.

07:45.227 --> 07:46.686
The longer we delay,

07:46.854 --> 07:50.104
the less the likelihood
of being able to divert it.

07:59.659 --> 08:01.735
Beam us up, Mr. Scott.

08:10.712 --> 08:14.626
Where am I? What place is this?

08:24.434 --> 08:28.847
What are these?
I feel I should know.

08:29.064 --> 08:33.892
They're familiar, and yet unfamiliar.

08:35.529 --> 08:37.403
How did I get here?

08:38.741 --> 08:43.202
Who am I? Try to remember.

09:12.317 --> 09:13.598
Wait.

09:54.528 --> 09:56.022
Who are you?

09:57.989 --> 10:00.481
We are your people.

10:00.659 --> 10:03.613
We've been waiting for you
to come to us.

10:09.918 --> 10:13.418
Captain's log, stardate 4843.6.

10:13.589 --> 10:15.498
First Officer Spock commanding.

10:15.674 --> 10:19.126
We've been en route
to the asteroid for several hours.

10:19.303 --> 10:20.845
Our delay on the planet's surface

10:21.013 --> 10:24.180
has made it imperative that
we proceed at maximum warp speed

10:24.350 --> 10:28.430
for a period which exceeds
the recommended safety margin.

10:29.022 --> 10:31.809
I can't give you warp 9 much longer,
Mr. Spock.

10:31.983 --> 10:34.308
These engines are beginning to show
signs of stress.

10:34.486 --> 10:36.562
Stress or not,
we cannot reduce speed.

10:36.738 --> 10:39.110
I do not intend
to miss that deflection point.

10:39.282 --> 10:43.114
All right. But we're moving further into
the danger range all the time. Every...

10:43.286 --> 10:46.987
Objection noted, Mr. Scott.
Carry on.

11:01.388 --> 11:04.343
Miramanee has said
that you appeared to her

11:04.517 --> 11:07.518
and to her handmaiden
from the walls of the temple,

11:07.687 --> 11:09.929
just as our legend foretells.

11:10.106 --> 11:12.561
We do not doubt
the words of our priestess,

11:12.734 --> 11:17.277
but these are troubled times
and we must be sure.

11:17.447 --> 11:20.483
I'll answer anything I can,
but as I told you,

11:21.451 --> 11:23.907
many things are strange to me.

11:24.079 --> 11:26.866
He knows nothing about danger.
How can he save us?

11:27.040 --> 11:30.539
It is against custom to interrupt
a tribal elder at council,

11:30.710 --> 11:32.869
even for the medicine chief.

11:33.046 --> 11:36.581
Elder, words will not save us
when the skies darken.

11:36.758 --> 11:40.708
We must be certain.
I say he must prove he is a god.

11:42.431 --> 11:46.096
Our skies have darkened
three times since the harvest,

11:46.268 --> 11:48.938
the last time worst of all.

11:49.105 --> 11:51.477
Our legend predicts such danger

11:51.649 --> 11:55.694
and promises that the Wise Ones
who planted us here

11:55.862 --> 11:57.854
will send a god to save us,

11:58.030 --> 12:03.452
one who can rouse the temple spirit
and make the sky grow quiet.

12:04.078 --> 12:06.367
Can you do this?

12:13.046 --> 12:16.830
I came from the temple,
as Miramanee said,

12:17.008 --> 12:21.884
and it was a beginning for me.

12:22.055 --> 12:23.466
Here.

12:24.850 --> 12:28.978
But I came from the sky too.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.104
Only, I

12:32.274 --> 12:34.101
can't remember.

12:35.069 --> 12:38.070
I can't remember.

12:39.615 --> 12:42.189
Salish, a terrible thing
has happened.

12:42.368 --> 12:43.862
The boy was attending the fishnets

12:44.036 --> 12:46.907
and he became entangled in them
and sank to the bottom of the river.

12:47.081 --> 12:49.323
Lumo brought him up quickly,

12:49.500 --> 12:51.244
but he doesn't move.

12:58.426 --> 13:00.752
There is no sound in the body.

13:01.763 --> 13:03.008
There is no light in the eyes.

13:05.392 --> 13:08.227
- He will move no more.
- Wait a moment.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.221
Wait.

14:05.871 --> 14:09.869
- He'll be all right now.
- My people are grateful.

14:11.836 --> 14:15.086
It's a simple technique.
Goes way back...

14:19.093 --> 14:20.635
Way back...

14:21.346 --> 14:24.549
Only a god can breathe life
into the dead.

14:26.643 --> 14:28.766
Do you still question?

14:34.526 --> 14:37.693
Give him the medicine badge.

15:33.670 --> 15:35.829
Deflection point minus seven.

15:36.465 --> 15:37.544
Full power, Mr. Scott.

15:37.716 --> 15:40.088
The relays will reject the overload,
Mr. Spock.

15:40.261 --> 15:42.668
Then bypass the relays,
go to manual control.

15:42.847 --> 15:46.975
- Do that, we'll burn out the engines.
- I want full power, Mr. Scott.

15:47.143 --> 15:52.766
Aye, sir. All right, you lovelies,
hold together.

15:56.486 --> 15:58.028
Full power, Mr. Spock.

15:58.196 --> 16:01.695
- Magnification factor 12, Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, sir.

16:09.875 --> 16:12.330
Deflection point minus four.

16:12.878 --> 16:15.120
All engines stop. Hold position here.

16:21.261 --> 16:23.550
All engines stopped, sir.

16:23.722 --> 16:27.554
- Prepare to activate deflectors.
- Aye, sir.

16:34.567 --> 16:35.729
Power dropping, sir.

16:36.986 --> 16:40.735
Engineering, maintain full power.
Full power.

16:40.907 --> 16:43.694
Dilithium crystal circuit is failing, sir.
We have to replace it.

16:43.868 --> 16:47.700
- Not now.
- Zero. Deflection point. Now, sir.

16:47.872 --> 16:49.035
Activate deflectors.

16:54.963 --> 16:56.706
Power dropping, sir.

17:04.263 --> 17:06.339
Degree of deflection, Mr. Sulu.

17:06.517 --> 17:11.891
Not enough, Mr. Spock.
It's only 0.0013 degrees.

17:13.523 --> 17:14.769
Recircuit power to engines.

17:14.942 --> 17:19.900
- Max speed, heading 37, mark 010.
- Aye, sir.

17:20.071 --> 17:22.112
That will put us directly
in the asteroid's path.

17:22.282 --> 17:25.450
Correct, Mr. Chekov. I intend to retreat
in front of that asteroid

17:25.619 --> 17:28.371
until we can employ all power
on phaser beams.

17:28.539 --> 17:30.828
- What for?
- To destroy it.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.784
A narrow beam concentrated
on a single spot will split that mass.

17:34.963 --> 17:38.296
It might also cripple the ship, and we
would be crushed by the asteroid.

17:38.466 --> 17:42.085
Incorrect. We'll still be able to get out
of its path by use of impulse power.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.753
Jim won't be able
to get out of its path.

17:44.931 --> 17:48.976
That, doctor, is another calculated risk
we must take.

18:03.033 --> 18:04.576
Miramanee.

18:09.123 --> 18:10.783
What are you doing?

18:10.958 --> 18:14.541
I must see to the needs of the god,
as is my duty.

18:15.088 --> 18:16.914
You should be working on
our ritual cloak.

18:17.882 --> 18:20.919
There will be no ritual
between us now, Salish.

18:21.094 --> 18:23.667
What do you mean?
We cannot go against tradition.

18:25.306 --> 18:29.007
It is because of tradition
that I cannot marry you.

18:29.978 --> 18:32.184
But you are promised to me.

18:34.066 --> 18:35.809
That was before he came.

18:36.276 --> 18:40.689
Tribal priestess and medicine chief
are always joined.

18:40.864 --> 18:43.355
He is medicine chief now.

18:46.245 --> 18:47.953
Salish, choose another.

18:48.122 --> 18:51.705
Any maiden
would be honoured to join with you.

18:51.876 --> 18:54.367
I wish no other.

19:02.345 --> 19:04.670
You have no choice.

19:08.476 --> 19:09.970
Miramanee,

19:10.145 --> 19:12.303
if you could choose,

19:15.400 --> 19:16.728
would you choose me?

20:01.781 --> 20:04.451
Perhaps you would like
to bathe now.

20:06.369 --> 20:08.029
Miramanee,

20:09.748 --> 20:13.117
tell me about the Wise Ones.

20:13.293 --> 20:15.749
Tell? But a god knows everything.

20:16.380 --> 20:19.001
Not this one. Tell me.

20:20.050 --> 20:23.466
The Wise Ones brought us here
from far away.

20:23.637 --> 20:27.421
They chose a medicine chief
to keep the secret of the temple

20:28.476 --> 20:31.311
and to use it when the sky darkens.

20:33.481 --> 20:36.019
Secrets of the temple.

20:38.486 --> 20:41.155
There are no lacings.
How is this thing removed?

20:41.322 --> 20:46.779
The secrets were passed on
from father to son?

20:47.454 --> 20:49.162
Yes. How does this open?

20:49.331 --> 20:53.660
Well, why doesn't Salish use it?
Why are the people in danger?

20:54.711 --> 20:57.665
His father did not wish
to share his power too soon.

20:57.839 --> 21:01.006
He died before he told Salish
the secret.

21:18.486 --> 21:22.947
Our people rejoice,
and wish to honour your name.

21:23.116 --> 21:27.363
But I did not know
what you wished to be called.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.364
What may I tell them?

21:37.505 --> 21:39.000
Ki...

21:39.883 --> 21:41.211
Kir...

21:41.718 --> 21:44.043
K... Kirok?

21:53.439 --> 21:58.101
- Have we displeased you?
- No, no. Everything is fine.

21:58.277 --> 22:01.693
Then it must be ourselves,
the way we live.

22:01.864 --> 22:07.107
Perhaps we have not improved
as quickly as the Wise Ones wish.

22:07.286 --> 22:10.572
Your land is rich,
your people happy.

22:11.332 --> 22:13.621
Who could be displeased with that?

22:14.836 --> 22:18.252
But there is something. Tell us.

22:18.423 --> 22:20.250
We will change it.

22:21.468 --> 22:23.875
I can't tell you anything.

22:26.014 --> 22:28.635
All I can tell you is that I'm...

22:29.476 --> 22:34.019
...happy and peaceful here.

22:35.023 --> 22:40.065
I'm not sure, but I think
I've never felt that way before.

22:50.122 --> 22:53.289
Why are they so sure
I can help them?

22:53.459 --> 22:55.582
Well, you came
from the stone metal.

22:55.753 --> 22:59.833
- And did you not bring life to the child?
- Yes, but I...

23:05.513 --> 23:07.839
I need time to remember.

23:12.270 --> 23:14.643
Here, there is much time.

23:17.859 --> 23:19.852
For everything.

23:33.125 --> 23:39.246
- Coordinates, Mr. Chekov.
- Tau 8.7, Beta 0.041.

23:39.423 --> 23:42.341
That is our target.
The asteroid's weakest point.

23:44.679 --> 23:45.924
Almost dead centre, sir.

23:47.140 --> 23:50.723
Lock all phasers on that mark.
Maximum intensity, narrow beam.

23:50.894 --> 23:53.182
I want to split that fissure wide open.

23:53.354 --> 23:54.897
You sound like
you're cutting a diamond.

23:55.065 --> 23:58.350
- Very astute, doctor.
- All phasers locked, sir.

23:58.526 --> 23:59.606
We'll fire in sequence

23:59.778 --> 24:03.063
and continue firing as long
as Mr. Scott can maintain power.

24:03.240 --> 24:06.988
- Standing by, sir.
- Fire phasers.

24:07.828 --> 24:08.859
Phaser 1 firing.

24:10.706 --> 24:13.707
That Vulcan won't be satisfied
till these panels are a puddle of lead.

24:13.876 --> 24:15.038
Phaser 2 firing.

24:16.712 --> 24:18.372
Main relay's out again, Mr. Scott.

24:21.550 --> 24:22.879
Phaser 4 firing.

24:25.638 --> 24:29.718
- All phasers fired, sir.
- Rig for simultaneous firing, Mr. Sulu.

24:29.892 --> 24:32.181
Commence simultaneous
bombardment.

24:39.903 --> 24:43.817
My bairns. My poor bairns.

24:59.423 --> 25:01.879
The ritual cloak is finished.

25:03.052 --> 25:05.969
If it pleases you,
I would like to name the Joining day.

25:06.138 --> 25:07.169
The Joining day?

25:07.765 --> 25:11.929
I'm the daughter of the chief.
Tribal law betroths me to our leader.

25:12.937 --> 25:14.680
If there is another, I will step aside.

25:17.984 --> 25:23.109
No, Miramanee, there is no one else
in my mind or my heart.

25:26.868 --> 25:29.904
God's wish is above tribal law.

25:35.627 --> 25:37.833
Name the Joining day.

25:42.801 --> 25:45.921
The sooner
our happiness together begins,

25:46.096 --> 25:48.634
the longer it will last.

25:51.143 --> 25:55.223
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

26:00.069 --> 26:03.438
And don't ask for any more
warp 9 speeds, Mr. Spock.

26:03.614 --> 26:05.322
Our star drive
is completely burned out.

26:05.491 --> 26:07.365
The only thing we have left
is impulse power.

26:07.535 --> 26:11.948
- Estimated repair time.
- Hanging here in space? Forever.

26:12.415 --> 26:16.080
The only thing that will fix these poor
darlings is the nearest repair base.

26:16.336 --> 26:20.500
I've already surmised that.
Thank you, Mr. Scott.

26:22.342 --> 26:23.717
Well, Spock,

26:23.885 --> 26:28.844
you took your calculated risk in your
calculated Vulcan way and you lost.

26:29.016 --> 26:32.848
You lost for us, you lost for that planet
and you lost for Jim.

26:33.020 --> 26:34.894
I accept the responsibility, doctor.

26:35.064 --> 26:37.815
And my responsibility
is the health of this crew.

26:37.983 --> 26:41.483
You've been driving yourself too hard
and I want you to get some rest.

26:42.988 --> 26:47.532
Mr. Chekov,
resume heading 883, mark 41.

26:47.702 --> 26:50.703
Back to that planet without
warp speed? Lt'll take months, Spock.

26:50.872 --> 26:56.032
Exactly 59.223 days, doctor.

26:56.210 --> 27:01.169
And that asteroid will be
four hours behind us all the way.

27:01.591 --> 27:03.916
Well, then, what's the use?

27:04.094 --> 27:08.388
We might not be able to save
the captain even if he still is alive.

27:08.557 --> 27:13.017
We might not be able to save anything,
including this ship.

27:19.401 --> 27:20.895
You haven't heard a word I've said.

27:22.112 --> 27:26.062
All you've been doing
is staring at that blasted obelisk.

27:26.575 --> 27:32.080
Another calculated
Vulcan risk, doctor.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.756
This Joining means
the end of darkness.

27:40.923 --> 27:44.090
It's a time for joy for all my people.

27:51.226 --> 27:56.267
You will wait until I walk the holy path
to the earth lodge first,

27:56.439 --> 28:00.105
to give me time to tell the priestess
that you follow

28:00.277 --> 28:03.646
and that the Joining will take place.

28:12.915 --> 28:15.371
I have found paradise.

28:15.543 --> 28:19.078
Surely no man has ever attained
such happiness.

28:30.975 --> 28:32.470
Get out of my way, Salish.

28:32.644 --> 28:36.143
Even though you be a god, Kirok,
I cannot permit this Joining.

28:36.314 --> 28:39.897
- Nobody's asking for your permission.
- Then you must strike me dead.

28:40.068 --> 28:42.737
I have no intention
of striking you dead.

28:47.617 --> 28:49.326
You bleed.

28:50.495 --> 28:51.954
You bleed, Kirok.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.455
Behold a god who bleeds.

29:04.760 --> 29:07.797
Behold a god who bleeds.

29:32.664 --> 29:35.238
Kill me. Kill me, Kirok.

29:35.417 --> 29:40.459
For I will not rest until I prove
to my people that you are no god.

30:26.053 --> 30:27.713
I thought you were reporting
to Sickbay.

30:27.888 --> 30:31.138
There isn't time, doctor,
I must decipher those obelisk symbols.

30:31.308 --> 30:33.515
They're a highly advanced form
of cipher writing.

30:33.686 --> 30:36.521
You've been trying to do that ever
since we started back to that planet.

30:36.689 --> 30:39.180
- Fifty-eight days.
- I'm aware of that, doctor.

30:39.358 --> 30:41.684
I'm also aware
that when we arrive at the planet

30:41.861 --> 30:45.230
we'll have barely four hours
to effect rescue.

30:45.656 --> 30:48.444
I believe those symbols are the key.

30:48.618 --> 30:50.610
Well, you won't read them
by killing yourself.

30:50.787 --> 30:52.578
You've hardly eaten or slept
for weeks.

30:52.747 --> 30:54.621
Now, if you don't let up,
you're gonna collapse.

30:54.791 --> 30:56.700
I am not hungry, doctor.

30:57.585 --> 31:02.413
And under stress, we Vulcans
can do without sleep for weeks.

31:02.799 --> 31:05.836
Well, your Vulcan metabolism is
so low it can hardly be measured

31:06.011 --> 31:09.047
and as for the pressure,
that green ice water you call blood...

31:09.222 --> 31:13.885
My physical condition is not important,
doctor. That obelisk is.

31:14.061 --> 31:18.438
Well, my diagnosis is exhaustion
brought on from overwork and guilt.

31:18.607 --> 31:21.692
You're blaming yourself for crippling
this ship, just as we blamed you.

31:21.861 --> 31:23.937
Well, we were wrong. So were you.

31:24.113 --> 31:27.280
You made a command decision.
Jim would have done the same.

31:27.450 --> 31:28.481
My prescription is rest.

31:28.659 --> 31:32.443
Now, do I have to
call the security guards to enforce it?

32:14.081 --> 32:15.873
Miramanee?

32:22.674 --> 32:24.216
Come here.

32:32.475 --> 32:34.219
Miramanee?

32:46.865 --> 32:49.736
Each time your arms hold me
is as joyous as the first.

32:49.910 --> 32:53.860
I'm happy. I'm so happy.

32:56.834 --> 33:02.623
If it weren't for the dreams, my mind
would be completely at peace.

33:03.716 --> 33:06.468
I thought you no longer
had the dreams,

33:06.636 --> 33:10.550
that you no longer saw the strange
lodge which moves through the sky.

33:12.058 --> 33:14.466
They've come back.

33:15.812 --> 33:19.810
They were gone for a while,
but they've come back.

33:19.983 --> 33:25.689
And I see faces too.

33:25.864 --> 33:27.524
Very dim.

33:28.241 --> 33:33.663
I feel I should know them.

33:35.249 --> 33:39.710
I feel my place is with them.

33:39.878 --> 33:43.497
Not here.

33:43.674 --> 33:47.174
I don't deserve this happiness.

33:48.429 --> 33:50.801
I have a gift for you.

33:52.266 --> 33:54.259
A gift?

33:58.022 --> 33:59.564
What?

34:00.108 --> 34:02.433
It may make you happy.

34:03.445 --> 34:04.820
Wait.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.272
These last few weeks,

34:07.449 --> 34:11.909
my love for Miramanee grows
stronger with each passing day.

34:12.078 --> 34:15.411
However, the dreams return
every night.

34:15.581 --> 34:21.621
Fragments of memories.
I can almost get hold of them.

34:21.797 --> 34:23.375
And then...

34:31.306 --> 34:33.465
I bear your child.

34:41.984 --> 34:43.527
You.

34:59.836 --> 35:05.839
A canal. And with it,
we'll bring the water from the lake

35:06.802 --> 35:09.008
right to the lodge.

35:09.179 --> 35:12.014
And we can expand the system

35:13.183 --> 35:17.727
and irrigate the fields
and double the food supply.

35:18.689 --> 35:21.643
And with the power of the lamp...

35:21.817 --> 35:23.395
- Lamp?
- Lamp.

35:23.569 --> 35:25.396
- Which turns night into day,

35:25.571 --> 35:29.865
we can cook twice as much food
and, as you taught us, pre...

35:30.034 --> 35:33.320
- Preserve.
- Preserve.

35:33.496 --> 35:37.031
- Preserve. Famine.
- For times of famine.

35:38.376 --> 35:40.285
That is why
you made the lamp, Kirok.

35:40.462 --> 35:43.498
So that I would never know when it
was night and I'd be forever cooking.

35:43.673 --> 35:45.547
Oh, no. No, no, no.

35:45.717 --> 35:49.797
That's not why I made the lamp at all,
to keep you forever cooking.

35:56.895 --> 36:01.356
It's only the wind and the thunder.

36:02.067 --> 36:07.406
I act like a stupid child.
I have nothing to fear. You are here.

36:16.082 --> 36:19.166
- It is time.
- Time?

36:19.335 --> 36:20.995
To go to the temple.
People will be waiting.

36:21.170 --> 36:23.163
- Why?
- To save them.

36:23.339 --> 36:25.913
But it's only the wind.
The wind can't harm them.

36:26.092 --> 36:29.259
The wind is only the beginning.
Soon, the sky will darken.

36:29.429 --> 36:34.424
The lake will go wild and the earth
will tremble. Only you can save us.

36:35.644 --> 36:38.051
But I can't do anything
about the wind or the sky.

36:39.439 --> 36:41.895
If we do not go now,
it will be too late.

36:42.067 --> 36:45.519
You must go inside the temple
and make the blue flame come out.

36:45.696 --> 36:49.480
I don't know how
to get inside the temple.

36:49.658 --> 36:51.817
But you are a god.

36:53.621 --> 36:56.788
Kirok! Kirok!

36:58.251 --> 37:00.290
Why are you not
at the temple, Kirok?

37:00.461 --> 37:03.546
Soon, the ground will begin to tremble.
The people need your help.

37:05.425 --> 37:08.212
We'll go to the caves.
It will be safe there.

37:08.386 --> 37:13.132
The caves? Surely a legend
can do more than that for his people.

37:13.308 --> 37:16.475
When the ground trembles,
the caves are not safe, Kirok.

37:16.645 --> 37:19.895
If you do not rouse the temple spirit,
we will all die.

37:20.065 --> 37:23.434
There is nothing you cannot do,
my husband.

37:23.610 --> 37:27.655
Well, what do you wait for, god?
Your robes?

37:34.330 --> 37:36.655
Take care of Miramanee.

38:08.156 --> 38:10.647
I am Kirok!

38:11.868 --> 38:17.325
I have come! I am Kirok!

38:35.893 --> 38:39.725
- I prescribed sleep.
- You prescribed rest, doctor.

38:39.897 --> 38:43.812
The symbols on the obelisk
are not words, they are musical notes.

38:43.985 --> 38:46.737
Musical notes?
You mean, it's nothing but a song?

38:46.905 --> 38:50.737
In a way, yes. Other cultures,
among them certain Vulcan offshoots,

38:50.909 --> 38:52.569
use musical notes as words.

38:52.744 --> 38:55.414
The tones correspond roughly
to an alphabet.

38:55.580 --> 38:57.407
Were you able to make any sense
of the symbols?

38:57.582 --> 39:00.074
Yes, the obelisk is a marker,
just as I thought.

39:00.252 --> 39:04.297
It was left by a super race
known as the Preservers.

39:04.465 --> 39:07.335
They passed through the galaxy
rescuing primitive cultures

39:07.509 --> 39:09.004
which were in danger of extinction

39:09.178 --> 39:13.306
and seeding them, so to speak,
where they could live and grow.

39:13.474 --> 39:15.846
I've always wondered
why there were so many humanoids

39:16.018 --> 39:17.181
scattered through the galaxy.

39:17.353 --> 39:20.936
So have I. Apparently, the Preservers
account for a number of them.

39:21.107 --> 39:23.894
That's probably how the planet
has survived all these centuries.

39:24.068 --> 39:26.440
The Preservers put
an asteroid deflector on the planet.

39:26.612 --> 39:29.898
Which has now become defective
and is failing to operate.

39:30.074 --> 39:33.942
And we have to find that deflector
and put it back into working order.

39:34.120 --> 39:36.908
- Otherwise...
- Precisely, doctor.

39:40.001 --> 39:41.460
There's the false one!

39:42.462 --> 39:44.289
Die! Die!

39:46.466 --> 39:48.957
No! No! Don't hurt him!

39:50.304 --> 39:52.131
- Miramanee!
- Don't hurt him!

39:52.306 --> 39:55.307
- Go back!
- He's false!

39:56.435 --> 39:58.973
- I belong to him.
- Then go.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.811
Go die with your false god.

40:03.150 --> 40:05.439
- You'll be killed!
- Traitor!

40:06.237 --> 40:07.945
Kill him!

40:08.573 --> 40:10.814
Die as we all do!

40:11.325 --> 40:13.567
Die, impostor!

40:14.162 --> 40:15.786
- You lied to us!
- Kill him!

40:15.955 --> 40:18.078
You're not a god!

40:43.192 --> 40:45.231
I need Nurse Chapel.

40:46.779 --> 40:48.688
- Spock to Enterprise.
- Come in, Mr. Spock.

40:48.864 --> 40:50.275
We've located the captain.

40:50.449 --> 40:53.865
Beam down Nurse Chapel
with an emergency surgical kit.

40:57.457 --> 41:01.501
My wife. Is she all right?

41:01.794 --> 41:05.543
- Wife?
- Hallucinations? Jim.

41:06.800 --> 41:07.831
Miramanee.

41:13.682 --> 41:14.713
Miramanee.

41:36.205 --> 41:39.455
The nurse has given you something
to ease the pain.

41:39.625 --> 41:42.033
Why were you being stoned?

41:45.047 --> 41:50.753
Kirok could not get back
into the temple.

41:50.929 --> 41:54.629
Naturally,
since he did not come from there.

41:56.935 --> 41:59.805
I saw him come...

42:11.158 --> 42:14.776
- Does he recognise us?
- His brain is unimpaired.

42:14.953 --> 42:17.741
Everything else is functioning normally
except his memory.

42:17.915 --> 42:19.658
- Can you help him?
- It would take time.

42:19.834 --> 42:23.831
Time, Dr. McCoy, is the one thing
we do not have in abundance.

42:26.549 --> 42:29.040
- Spock here.
- Tracking report, sir.

42:29.218 --> 42:32.552
Sixty-five minutes
to end of safety margin.

42:32.722 --> 42:35.213
Report noted.

42:36.476 --> 42:40.094
Doctor, is he strong enough
for the Vulcan mind-fusion?

42:40.271 --> 42:42.809
We have no choice.

42:53.118 --> 42:56.285
I am Spock.

42:57.289 --> 43:00.658
You are James Kirk.

43:00.834 --> 43:04.784
Our minds are moving closer.

43:04.964 --> 43:10.171
Closer, closer, closer, James Kirk.

43:10.344 --> 43:12.420
Closer.

43:13.514 --> 43:14.759
No.

43:14.932 --> 43:17.684
- James Kirk.
- Miramanee!

43:17.852 --> 43:20.425
No. Miramanee.

43:20.605 --> 43:25.018
Our minds are one.

43:27.112 --> 43:33.993
- I am Kirok.
- Kirok.

43:34.536 --> 43:39.163
I am Kirok.

43:39.332 --> 43:42.867
I am Ki...

43:44.546 --> 43:49.089
l... I'm Kirok!

43:50.177 --> 43:53.048
- I am...
- Spock!

43:56.016 --> 44:00.394
- What is it?
- His mind.

44:00.563 --> 44:05.640
He's an extremely
dynamic individual.

44:14.786 --> 44:16.446
It worked.

44:24.421 --> 44:26.663
Captain,
were you inside this structure?

44:28.258 --> 44:32.303
Yes. What's inside is loaded
with scientific equipment.

44:32.471 --> 44:34.843
This obelisk is one huge
deflector mechanism.

44:35.015 --> 44:38.052
It is imperative
that we get inside immediately.

44:39.270 --> 44:42.271
Captain, we do not have much time.

44:46.736 --> 44:47.767
McCoy.

44:55.870 --> 44:57.115
I don't know how to get inside.

44:57.288 --> 44:58.948
If we are not able to gain entry

44:59.123 --> 45:02.124
and activate the deflector mechanism
within the next 50 minutes,

45:02.293 --> 45:05.129
this entire planet will be destroyed.

45:06.423 --> 45:09.507
The key must be in these symbols.
We've gotta decipher them.

45:09.676 --> 45:12.962
I already have to some extent, captain.
They are musical notes.

45:13.138 --> 45:14.466
You mean, entry can be gained

45:14.640 --> 45:16.798
by playing certain notes
on a musical instrument?

45:16.975 --> 45:18.220
That would be one method.

45:18.393 --> 45:20.766
Another would be a series
of tonal qualities

45:20.938 --> 45:22.646
spoken in their proper sequence.

45:22.815 --> 45:24.807
Give me your communicator.

45:25.818 --> 45:27.857
Tonal control.
Consonants and vowels.

45:28.028 --> 45:30.317
I must have hit it accidentally
when I contacted the ship.

45:30.489 --> 45:33.823
If you can remember
your exact words, captain...

45:37.955 --> 45:40.826
- Kirk to Enterprise.
- Aye, captain.

45:44.170 --> 45:47.124
Scotty, if the deflector
isn't activated within 20 minutes,

45:47.298 --> 45:51.296
get out of orbit. Get the Enterprise
out of the danger zone.

45:51.886 --> 45:55.671
The landing party is expendable.
The Enterprise isn't.

45:56.224 --> 45:57.849
Kirk out.

45:58.518 --> 46:00.013
Miramanee.

46:02.356 --> 46:05.025
Bones, stay with her.

46:05.192 --> 46:06.935
Do what you can.

46:17.663 --> 46:20.154
It is similar to deflector panels
I've seen, captain,

46:20.333 --> 46:22.574
but far more complicated.

46:22.752 --> 46:27.165
Careful. I must have
hit something accidentally.

46:27.715 --> 46:32.045
A beam caught me and that's when
I stopped remembering.

46:32.220 --> 46:36.218
Probably a memory beam. You must
have activated it out of sequence.

46:37.183 --> 46:40.387
More symbols. Can you read them?

46:40.562 --> 46:42.685
I do have an excellent eye
for musical notes, captain.

46:42.856 --> 46:46.688
They would seem to indicate
that this series of relays, activated in...

46:46.860 --> 46:49.896
Spock, just press the right button.

47:21.354 --> 47:26.265
- How is she?
- She had bad internal injuries, Jim.

47:26.818 --> 47:28.609
Will she live?

47:29.905 --> 47:31.280
No.

47:58.142 --> 48:02.472
Kirok. It is true. You are safe.

48:03.481 --> 48:06.268
And so are your people,
Miramanee.

48:08.653 --> 48:12.022
I knew you would save them,
my chief.

48:16.036 --> 48:17.993
When I am better,

48:19.498 --> 48:25.038
it will be as it was, will it not?

48:26.171 --> 48:28.045
If that's what you want.

48:30.926 --> 48:35.837
We will live long and happy lives.

48:37.516 --> 48:42.013
I will bear you many strong sons.

48:46.818 --> 48:51.065
I'll love you always.

48:53.575 --> 48:57.026
And I'll love you, Miramanee.

48:57.537 --> 48:59.280
Always.

49:11.718 --> 49:16.630
Each kiss is as the first.
