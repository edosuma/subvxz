00:02.280 --> 00:03.247
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.440 --> 00:06.250
He can't know that you're his father.
And nobody else can.

00:06.520 --> 00:10.081
Samantha, there is someone in my life now.
Please, don't make me keep this from her.

00:10.360 --> 00:12.761
You will if you want
a relationship with my son.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.765
I know who Oliver Queen
cares about more than anyone.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.445
Nora, honey,
there's someone I'd like you to meet.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.602
This is William.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.205
It's an implantable bio stimulant.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.448
This little piece of technology
is gonna help me walk again?

00:22.680 --> 00:24.603
After it's implanted in your spine. Yes.

00:28.760 --> 00:32.287
I can do this. I can do this.
I can so totally do this.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.445
Yes, you can.
But either way, we've got you.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.290
There's no pressure here, Ms. Smoak.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.284
Curtis' implant
is the longest of long shots.

00:43.560 --> 00:44.721
I was expecting
a little more encouragement

00:44.920 --> 00:46.649
from the husband of the genius
who invented the thing.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.882
My man works miracles with technology,

00:49.080 --> 00:51.481
but the human body
doesn't play by the same rules.

00:51.640 --> 00:52.641
Well...

00:53.240 --> 00:54.127
Here we go.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.322
Here we go.

00:55.560 --> 00:56.925
Here we go.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.481
Here we're going.

01:04.879 --> 01:07.565
Okay. It's okay.
Got you. Got you. Got you.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.241
Here we go.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.082
Well, that went nowhere.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.760
<i>- Curtis ever tell you how we met?
- Mmm-mmm.</i>

01:16.080 --> 01:18.481
He came in with an Achilles tendinitis.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.682
He was training to qualify
for the Olympics,

01:20.920 --> 01:23.400
- so all he cared about was results.
- Mmm.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.321
Took me weeks just to get him
focused on what really mattered.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.082
How handsome his therapist was?

01:29.640 --> 01:30.846
Healing.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.003
You gotta be patient with yourself.
These things take time.

01:43.160 --> 01:46.050
Are you sure
what Conklin told you was the truth?

01:46.200 --> 01:49.966
Conklin was dying.
He had no reason to lie.

01:50.160 --> 01:53.243
Whatever Reiter has planned,
he is gonna kill everyone here.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.771
Mr. Queen.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.010
It appears we are within
striking distance of my prize.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.768
I want you both at my side
when I claim it.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.281
I don't give a damn
about your superstitious crusade.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.848
Nevertheless,
you'll both bear witness to its fruition.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.565
You Okay?

02:20.760 --> 02:21.761
Me?

02:21.960 --> 02:24.247
I knew you were gonna ask me,
so I thought I'd beat you to the punch.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.090
Are you okay?

02:27.280 --> 02:29.760
A guy, a brilliant guy,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.925
says he can put a microchip
in my spine and I will walk again.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.246
I'm enough of a geek to know
science fiction when I see it.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.646
You're still disappointed.

02:39.480 --> 02:43.849
- Yeah. You know. It's stupid.
- No.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.321
Talk to me.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.489
I wanted to be able to walk down the aisle
on our wedding day.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.287
Aw, you two just melt my stone-cold heart.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.449
<i>You almost make me believe in love again.</i>

03:05.640 --> 03:08.166
Nice to see you, Mr. Queen.
How was your Christmas?

03:08.360 --> 03:09.407
Son of a bitch.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.483
Oh! You're so brave for a political
candidate and reformed party boy.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.682
Oh, sorry about the limo.
Love the wheelchair.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.048
Might I suggest motorized?

03:21.680 --> 03:24.286
We have extremely powerful friends.
You do not know who you're messing with.

03:24.480 --> 03:28.201
If it makes you happy,
the "messing" ends today.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.971
I tried to bring you
into the fold, Mr. Queen.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.844
I tried to kidnap
your nearest and dearest.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.168
I tried to kill you,
but none of that took.

03:35.400 --> 03:39.007
Like she said,
you don't know who you're messing with.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.123
I suspect that is true.

03:42.560 --> 03:47.726
But as they say... Well, or should,
the fourth time is the charm.

03:49.320 --> 03:52.369
Go ahead. Take a look. I'll wait.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.487
William thinks that
I'm friends with his mother.

04:00.680 --> 04:01.886
<i>Funny.</i>

04:02.720 --> 04:05.849
Anyhoo, 6:00 on Friday
you're going to hold a press conference

04:06.040 --> 04:07.451
and drop out of the mayoral race.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.286
Oh, that's 6:00 p.m., by the way.

04:10.520 --> 04:14.081
I'll be at home watching you
from my brand new television.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.842
What did he show you on your phone?
Who's William?

04:25.560 --> 04:27.403
He's my son.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.960
Please say something.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.362
Look, Felicity, I can explain...

04:41.560 --> 04:42.971
Stop.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.090
I cannot hear another lie.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.726
You know, it's more complicated than that.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.410
God, Oliver,
you are the only person on the planet

04:51.640 --> 04:53.244
that considers the truth complicated.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.647
Just to be clear,
I don't care that you have a child.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.166
I can't believe that you have a child
that you didn't tell me about.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.969
What does it say about our relationship

05:06.200 --> 05:08.931
if your first instinct
is to always hide the truth?

05:09.160 --> 05:10.571
William's mother made a condition

05:10.760 --> 05:14.082
that the only way I would be
allowed to meet my son

05:14.280 --> 05:16.169
is if I agreed to keep him secret.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.367
Even from you.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.289
Who even makes that kind of ultimatum?

05:20.480 --> 05:22.403
I just don't...
A mother who is trying to protect her son.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.602
And she thought that
the best thing for him

05:24.840 --> 05:26.490
was to keep his world separate from mine.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.929
After everything that's happened,
can you really say that she was wrong?

05:30.120 --> 05:31.690
Well, it didn't work, did it?

05:32.760 --> 05:34.250
Somehow Darhk still found out.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.091
Hey, we got your 911.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.362
<i>Darhk paid us a visit.
He's holding a 10-year-old boy hostage.</i>

05:41.560 --> 05:44.609
Says that he'll release him
if Oliver drops out of the mayoral race.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.926
<i>Let's get in touch with Alex.</i>

05:46.120 --> 05:48.327
Have him schedule a press conference
for Friday at 6:00 p.m.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.330
You are not actually
going for this, are you?

05:50.520 --> 05:52.602
The boy Darhk has, William...

05:53.800 --> 05:54.926
He's my son.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.770
<i>Yeah, I just found out, too.</i>

05:58.000 --> 06:01.163
Apparently, the only two people that knew
about William were Oliver and Darhk.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.370
Actually, I found out too.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.570
Um, what's our next plan?

06:07.840 --> 06:09.330
William lives in Central City, right?

06:09.520 --> 06:10.567
Yeah.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.962
I will call Barry.
See what the CCPD can do.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.884
Is it okay if I tell Barry
that William is your...

06:17.000 --> 06:18.525
Barry knows too.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.006
Let's also get in touch with Malcolm.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.282
He has an ax to grind after
what happened with the League, and, um...

06:25.040 --> 06:27.327
Malcolm knows as well.

06:27.520 --> 06:32.208
Maybe it would be easier to list the
people who don't know about your son.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.563
- Samantha's here.
- Who's Samantha?

06:39.520 --> 06:41.204
It's William's mother.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.487
Alex?

06:49.720 --> 06:51.006
She said her name was Samantha Clayton.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.725
The name struck a bell
from the million dollar check

06:52.920 --> 06:54.160
you told Thea
wasn't going to be a problem.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.930
It's not going to be a problem.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.167
Okay.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.328
Then why did I
just get a 911 text from Thea

06:59.560 --> 07:00.766
telling me that
you're pulling out of the race?

07:04.600 --> 07:06.364
Have you heard from William?
Do you know where he is?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.562
I don't, but I'm doing everything I can.

07:08.760 --> 07:09.761
I knew it.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.769
I knew it the second
I realized he was gone.

07:11.960 --> 07:15.646
I knew that you had to have
some sort of involvement in this.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.411
My God, what was I thinking
letting you get into his life?

07:19.360 --> 07:20.521
Two months later, and he's missing.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.768
Samantha, I need you to tell me
exactly what happened.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.968
No, Oliver. You need to tell me
what the hell is going on

07:25.160 --> 07:27.162
and you need to give me
my son back right now.

07:27.360 --> 07:31.001
I'm trying, but you need to tell me
what happened, please.

07:33.360 --> 07:36.728
I went upstairs to get him for dinner,
and he was gone.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.570
Gone.

07:38.760 --> 07:42.651
No... No note, no sign of struggle.
Just vanished.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.487
I called the CCPD,
and they've been looking everywhere,

07:45.680 --> 07:48.843
but it's already been
48 hours and still nothing.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.805
But then a crime scene technician
pulled me aside,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.162
and said that
I needed to talk to you about this.

07:54.360 --> 07:55.521
Barry Allen?

07:55.720 --> 07:56.926
Yes, that's the one.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.568
- Oliver, you promised.
- L...

08:00.760 --> 08:03.366
You promised me that
you wouldn't tell anyone about my son...

08:03.560 --> 08:05.801
Barry figured it...
That's not what's important right now.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.929
What's important is
I'm going to do everything,

08:08.120 --> 08:11.522
and I mean absolutely everything
in my power and we will get him back!

08:11.760 --> 08:12.807
What can you do, Oliver?

08:13.000 --> 08:16.163
What can you do that the entire
police force hasn't been able to do?

08:16.360 --> 08:17.930
Samantha...

08:20.600 --> 08:22.489
I'm the Green Arrow.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.650
This doesn't make any sense.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.889
Well, like I said,
I'm not the person that I used to be.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.962
Samantha, these are my friends and
they are going to help us find William.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.965
You probably remember...

08:39.480 --> 08:40.527
Laurel Lance?

08:41.159 --> 08:44.164
I'm so sorry
that you're going through this, Samantha.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.010
We will help you get William back.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.929
Look, Laurel... It was one time.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.289
And I knew that
you and Oliver were together,

08:54.480 --> 08:58.246
but I was young and stupid and selfish.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.610
And I should have been honest with you.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.167
No. Oliver should have been.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.120
Come on.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.644
Does CCPD have anything?

09:11.840 --> 09:13.729
No. it was a clean grab.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.924
Do we have any other angles we can work?
Other than Malcolm.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.766
Finding William isn't the problem.
Beating Damien Darhk is.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.522
Every time we've faced him
we have been beaten, thoroughly.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.324
It's because
we can't go against his magic.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.807
We just need to fight harder,
we need to fight smarter.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.041
No, Oliver.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.481
Insanity is doing
the same thing over and over again

09:30.680 --> 09:32.125
and expecting a different result.

09:33.760 --> 09:34.807
We need a new strategy.

09:35.000 --> 09:35.967
What about Constantine?

09:36.160 --> 09:37.321
He's in hell.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.681
Really? What's going on?

09:38.880 --> 09:41.690
I mean, he's actually literally in hell.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.001
Oh.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.204
But I might know someone else.
Her name is Mari McCabe.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.210
She possesses a totem
which is powered by magic.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.881
She calls herself Vixen.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.200
What the hell was that thing?

09:57.400 --> 09:59.289
Cerico doesn't pay us enough to find out.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.284
Come on out. Face us like a man.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.010
<i>I've got</i> a <i>better idea.</i>

10:34.960 --> 10:38.009
How about I kick your ass
like a woman instead?

10:38.240 --> 10:39.241
What the hell?

10:52.240 --> 10:53.730
- I had that under control.
- I know.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.408
What, not enough in Star City
to keep you busy?

10:58.360 --> 11:00.408
I need your help.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.769
I have got to get me one of these.

11:10.760 --> 11:13.001
- Mari.
- Laurel, hey.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.362
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.400
Mari, this is John Diggle
and my sister, Thea.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.647
Pleasure.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.360
It's nice to meet you.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.767
Sorry it's under
such horrible circumstances.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.803
You spoke to Felicity on the phone.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.280
_H€Y-_H€Y-

11:28.480 --> 11:31.131
And this is Samantha. William's mother.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.085
She's a friend.
A hero in Detroit they call "Vixen."

11:34.280 --> 11:37.329
Mari and I had
an animated encounter last year

11:37.520 --> 11:39.602
and we've stayed in touch ever since.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.842
How are you going to help me find my son?

11:42.320 --> 11:43.446
With magic.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.801
- Magic?
- Yeah.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.970
It's a long story,
but the short version is that this totem

11:50.160 --> 11:54.404
gives me the ability to channel
the ashe or the spirit of any animal.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.930
Do you have anything
of William's with you?

11:57.120 --> 12:00.169
Yes, I do. Just this. It's his favorite.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.127
Don't you dare
tell Barry about this.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.122
He's in the city. I think I can find him.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.731
Okay, good. Dig and I will cover you.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.129
Laurel, get in touch with your father,
we're gonna loop in the SCPD.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.163
Felicity, I need you to...

12:38.720 --> 12:40.404
Would it be all right
if you sat with Samantha?

12:40.600 --> 12:42.682
Working up a search profile. Sure.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.644
Thank you. Thea.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.683
Yeah, Malcolm's coming over.
I'll go talk to him.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.211
We're going to find him.
And he's going to be okay.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.526
Okay.

12:56.200 --> 13:00.569
Can you feel it? The energy. Primordial.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.201
What is that?

13:09.680 --> 13:11.887
Destiny, Mr. Queen.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.202
I know you're here.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.324
There's no need to lurk in the shadows
like the boogeyman.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.490
You haven't seen me in a while.
And I'm not the man I used to be.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.726
Yeah, I know.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.331
They told me.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.927
- Not pretty, is it?
- Mmm.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.725
It could have been a lot worse.
Could've chopped your head off.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.410
And I would've been better off for it.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.250
He took the League away from me
and gave it to Nyssa al Ghul.

14:05.440 --> 14:08.205
And that was more important
than saving your daughter's life?

14:09.680 --> 14:12.684
Yeah, heard about
that part of the story too.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.207
Refusing to bargain with Nyssa
to save me...

14:16.400 --> 14:17.731
My intention was to save your life

14:17.960 --> 14:21.123
and to keep my seat of power
for the betterment of the world.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.210
Did you tell Darhk about Ollie's son?

14:24.400 --> 14:25.845
Do you really think
I'd do something like that...

14:26.040 --> 14:27.644
Just answer the question.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.086
No.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.444
No, I won't.

14:32.160 --> 14:35.528
Because you should know me better
than to ask me the question.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.563
I know you all too well.

14:37.760 --> 14:38.761
You should know one thing, Thea,

14:39.320 --> 14:42.244
no matter what happens,
I will always love you.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.687
It's what fathers do.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.926
Crazy world we live in, huh?
Metahumans. Magic.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.845
Oliver Queen, father.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.526
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- No, man, I totally get it.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.285
Samantha put you in a tough spot.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.208
Couldn't have been
an easy decision for you,

15:17.400 --> 15:18.925
and I totally get why you made it.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.127
She was right.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.800
William was safer
when I didn't know about him.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.650
So maybe if I never found out I...

15:24.840 --> 15:26.808
Can't even go there, man.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.244
You'll eat yourself up inside with the
"What if this" or the "Maybe that."

15:32.040 --> 15:33.565
Part of being a parent.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.681
Most important thing now is focusing
on getting your boy back home safe.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.006
John“.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.083
How do you do it?

15:44.280 --> 15:46.362
I know where Sarah is every night, Oliver.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.402
I know what she's doing. Who she's with.

15:49.880 --> 15:53.282
She sees my face every single day

15:54.920 --> 15:56.285
I'm there for her.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.161
And she knows, and I know

16:01.720 --> 16:04.246
that I would never
let anything bad happen to her.

16:04.480 --> 16:08.371
I keep her close, man, and that's how you
keep your children safe.

16:12.840 --> 16:17.687
He was wearing a blue hoodie,
plaid shirt, gray corduroys,

16:17.880 --> 16:22.010
and, um, a Diamonds baseball cap.
He's a big fan.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.201
Oliver likes baseball too.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.449
Here's hoping that the innate
fatherly influence stops there.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.281
Um, does he have any
distinguishing features?

16:31.800 --> 16:33.802
Freckles, birthmarks, anything like that?

16:35.280 --> 16:38.523
Oliver told me that
there was someone in his life.

16:38.760 --> 16:39.886
Someone special.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.723
And her name was Felicity.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.288
He wanted to tell you
and I wouldn't let him.

16:47.480 --> 16:51.451
I didn't know who he was now.
I didn't know what kind of person he was.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.371
That's going around.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.442
Just try and remember
that I was the one that made him choose

16:57.640 --> 16:59.483
between you and knowing his son.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.211
All right, I've got the whole force,
what's left of them anyway,

17:06.400 --> 17:07.560
canvassing for William.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.125
Thank you.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.243
You don't seem as surprised as I expected.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.646
What, that party boy Oliver Queen
knocked up some girl?

17:14.880 --> 17:17.451
I'm amazed there isn't an army of
little Olivers running around out there.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.121
Well, there may be.
He certainly got around back then.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.601
Yeah.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.445
You okay?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.040
I don't know.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.929
It's the mother, Samantha.

17:28.319 --> 17:30.482
She was with him when I was with him.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.160
Baby...

17:34.400 --> 17:36.767
I don't know why it still stings.

17:37.720 --> 17:38.881
It was a million years ago

17:39.120 --> 17:41.566
and it's not like I didn't know
that Oliver cheated on me.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.728
Yeah, but that's one thing.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.763
Knowing he had a kid...

17:47.480 --> 17:48.481
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.207
- Come here.
- Thank you.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.440
It's Oliver.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.648
He knows where William's being held.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.489
I count four guards patrolling the roof.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.841
Mari's in position.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.962
I wondered how long it would take for
your buddy Oliver to drag you into this.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.202
- Where is the boy?
- Oh, he's fine.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.481
I had him moved about two minutes

19:03.680 --> 19:05.808
before you and your posse
disturbed my evening in.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.081
You know what?

19:07.320 --> 19:09.243
You might wanna learn
to be a little bit more discreet.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.843
Have you considered black
instead of green?

19:12.080 --> 19:14.651
- You tell me where you've taken him.
- Or what?

19:14.880 --> 19:18.089
You'll fire an arrow at me?
I think we've seen that movie before.

19:18.280 --> 19:21.045
Iwin. You lose. Rinse, repeat.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.241
This time's different.

19:22.640 --> 19:23.846
Oh, really?

19:28.400 --> 19:29.481
Where's the boy?

19:29.760 --> 19:33.560
You have some
very interesting friends.

19:36.760 --> 19:37.807
Atta boy.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.601
My, mY-

19:41.280 --> 19:43.282
I haven't seen that trinket
in a dog's age.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.926
M'Changa province, am I right?

19:50.600 --> 19:51.681
(Sta)'-

19:58.680 --> 20:01.081
Oh, I like you.
And I don't like many people.

20:24.760 --> 20:25.966
<i>I</i> QOt you.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.480
What happened? Where did he go?

20:36.640 --> 20:38.768
- I can't track him.
- Darhk's protected by magic.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.764
<i>No, not just Darhk.</i>

20:40.960 --> 20:42.485
I lost William.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.362
Where's William? What happened?

20:54.600 --> 20:56.523
We had a small setback,
but we're not giving up.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.767
"Setback"? What do you mean?

20:58.040 --> 21:00.008
Hey, blocked ID.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.001
Hello.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.003
<i>Oh, hi, Oliver.
How's your evening going?</i>

21:05.200 --> 21:08.010
Mine, somewhat eventful.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.090
Some of your friends stopped by
my place earlier, completely unannounced.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.441
Very rude.

21:12.680 --> 21:15.365
I wanna talk to my son, Darhk.
I wanna know that he's safe.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.522
Oh, this must be the first time
your son's been kidnapped

21:17.720 --> 21:19.961
'cause clearly you don't understand
how these things work.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.361
I make the demands.

21:21.520 --> 21:25.206
Well, you've made them and I've agreed.
Friday night I'm dropping out of the race.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.401
<i>Why wait?</i>

21:26.600 --> 21:28.648
Give your green friend
less time to botch things up.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.201
So, go find yourself a television camera.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.089
I wanna know that my son is safe!

21:33.280 --> 21:36.727
Oh, and by the way, you're going to
completely endorse Ruvé Adams.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.885
Save us all the trouble of those
pesky little write-in ballots.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.930
He moved up the timetable.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.406
He wants me to drop
out of the race tonight.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.886
Thea, let Alex know.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.561
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

21:52.240 --> 21:54.083
I know you brought me here
to fight magic with magic, but I...

21:54.240 --> 21:55.401
Mari, this isn't on you.

21:55.560 --> 21:58.404
There's still so much
that we don't know about Darhk's power.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.841
We don't... We don't even know
what the source of it is.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.081
Wait.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.925
I get my powers from this necklace.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.923
Without it,
I'm just a wannabe fashion designer

22:07.120 --> 22:08.770
who lives at home with her foster dad.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.685
So up to now, everyone I've gone up
against with mystical powers

22:11.920 --> 22:13.331
has had some sort of a totem like mine.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.251
What if Darhk has an object
that helps him with his magic?

22:16.400 --> 22:17.765
I think he does.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.129
I walked in on him once or twice
in front of this cabinet thing.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.924
And inside there is some kind of,
I don't know, idol.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.081
Can you draw it for me?

22:26.320 --> 22:27.446
Well, yeah, I'll give it a whirl.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.762
Okay, Oliver, what if this little
art project doesn't yield any results?

22:31.960 --> 22:33.803
- Well...
- And what if it takes too long?

22:34.040 --> 22:38.807
Mari and Captain Lance are working
on a way to eventually stop Darhk.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.762
Right now, I have to save William.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.441
What's he saying?

22:49.600 --> 22:51.967
Whatever it is, it's not good.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.491
We have to get out of here now.

23:09.120 --> 23:10.121
Reiter, what are you doing?

23:10.320 --> 23:11.651
Proving what I know about you is true.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.205
You can't leave us in here with it!

23:13.400 --> 23:14.561
Reiter!

23:25.880 --> 23:27.564
You...

23:31.800 --> 23:33.290
You are worthy to pass.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.126
Good evening.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.006
When I entered this race,

23:52.240 --> 23:55.801
it was because no one else
was willing to step into the spotlight.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.325
It has always been my hope
that my actions would inspire others.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.525
Four months later and they have.

24:03.720 --> 24:08.089
Knowing that, effective immediately,
I will be suspending my campaign

24:10.200 --> 24:13.886
and throwing my full support
behind Ruvé Adams.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.241
Now, I'd like to take a moment

24:16.440 --> 24:20.411
to thank all my supporters
for all of your hard work.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.848
What you've done will not be forgotten.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.211
Thank you.

24:39.480 --> 24:43.201
New numbers are out.
You were leading by 16 points.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.767
Alex, I'm sorry.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.163
I know that you put your heart and soul
into this campaign and...

24:49.680 --> 24:52.524
And your days of speech-making
are now behind you.

24:54.240 --> 25:00.930
Look, man. I don't want "sorry."
I just want an explanation.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.243
That's why I'm sorry.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.610
Sucks when you can't tell the truth.

25:19.640 --> 25:21.961
Samantha told me about her ultimatum.

25:22.880 --> 25:26.327
I just figured
that eventually she'd trust me.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.966
Yeah, you'd work your Oliver Queen charm.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.283
I didn't wanna be a part of William's life

25:31.480 --> 25:33.926
without the opportunity for you
to be a part of his life.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.003
John's made it pretty clear

25:37.200 --> 25:39.931
that, uh, I should've made more of an
effort to be a part of William's life.

25:40.800 --> 25:44.691
And that the best way to keep him safe
would've been to keep him close.

25:44.880 --> 25:48.282
Even with all of this.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.568
Your resignation's all over the news.
Have you heard from Darhk?

25:52.760 --> 25:55.047
Not yet.

25:56.360 --> 25:58.727
Speak of the devil. Literally.

25:59.720 --> 26:03.486
It's not Darhk. It's Mari.
She has something.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.448
I emailed Captain Lance's
drawing of Darhk's idol

26:07.640 --> 26:09.051
to a friend of mine at Detroit University.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.241
And did he recognize it?

26:10.440 --> 26:13.489
It's a Khushu idol.
Very rare. Very powerful.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.364
But its power
requires a constant connection

26:15.560 --> 26:17.050
to one of the Earth's ley lines.

26:17.760 --> 26:20.764
- I never thought I'd say this, but huh?
- Okay.

26:21.080 --> 26:25.847
Think Wi-Fi for magic.
And the idol is his Internet connection.

26:26.040 --> 26:29.169
If Professor Macalester's theory
is correct, and this map is accurate...

26:29.400 --> 26:32.529
Then Darhk must be holed up
near one of these ley lines

26:32.720 --> 26:33.767
in order for him to get
the strongest signal.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.611
I'll start cross-referencing all the
locations that we've encountered Darhk.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.690
You pulled out of the race.
Why isn't this man giving me my son back?

26:39.880 --> 26:41.405
He will and everything will be fine.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.887
You keep saying that,
but it hasn't been yet.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.281
You're doing everything you possibly can.

26:58.560 --> 26:59.891
You can't beat yourself up about it.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.048
Well, you don't know me very well, do you?

27:05.120 --> 27:10.047
Just before Christmas, Darhk took
Thea, Felicity, John, held them captive.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.889
We agreed that
I would trade myself for them,

27:14.080 --> 27:15.081
I did,

27:17.680 --> 27:20.411
and Darhk did not live up
to his end of the bargain.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.762
So you're worried
that's playing itself out again now?

27:24.760 --> 27:26.922
We're going to get William back, Oliver.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.844
But when we do,

27:29.080 --> 27:31.401
I think you should consider that...

27:33.760 --> 27:37.287
Maybe letting him go
isn't such a bad thing.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.161
What do you mean?

27:39.400 --> 27:44.247
Well, I heard what you told Felicity
about keeping him close.

27:45.280 --> 27:46.691
Owl ears.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.122
Uh, I never knew my real parents.

27:49.840 --> 27:55.688
I grew up in a foster home
and my whole life I wondered, "Who am I?"

27:56.640 --> 27:59.086
"Where did I come from?
Why didn't my real parents want me?"

27:59.320 --> 28:02.369
A boy should know who his father is.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.847
He should. And he will.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.130
But knowing what William
is going through right now

28:07.320 --> 28:09.766
I realize that
I wasn't ready for the answers.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.322
Learning about my heritage, my powers,

28:13.520 --> 28:16.922
the evil my mother fled our homeland
to protect me from,

28:17.120 --> 28:19.122
no child should have to carry that burden.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.726
I mean, look around you, Oliver.

28:22.760 --> 28:26.321
The best gift
you can give him is his childhood.

28:27.800 --> 28:30.770
Keep him as far away from your world
for as long as possible.

28:33.680 --> 28:36.160
I can't imagine a greater sacrifice.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.481
Isn't that what parenthood is?

28:44.280 --> 28:47.523
Hey, guys. I think we found something.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.806
Darhk moves his idol around,
which makes sense but...

28:52.040 --> 28:53.201
It makes him a whole lot harder to track.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.323
Right, but after referencing
a buttload of satellite feed,

28:55.520 --> 28:57.045
thermal imaging data in the ley line map,

28:57.240 --> 28:59.447
I think Darhk's located out
in a compound in Sky Woods.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.127
Hello?

29:03.320 --> 29:05.926
Very good speech.
You look great on television.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.690
<i>Nelson Plaza. Three hours.</i>

29:07.880 --> 29:09.041
William will be there.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.165
Darhk says he's going to release William
three hours from now at Nelson Plaza.

29:15.360 --> 29:17.681
There is no guarantee with Darhk.
This could be a trap.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.042
And now we have a chance
to take out his power idol thingy.

29:20.560 --> 29:24.042
Ollie, without his magic, he won't be able
to do this to anybody ever again.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.009
It will be game over.

29:26.800 --> 29:31.522
Samantha, he's your son. it is your call.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.891
He's your son too, Oliver.

29:36.840 --> 29:42.244
Get him back.
And take this son of a bitch Darhk out.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.764
I count 17 Ghosts.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.689
Copy. Black Canary?

29:57.880 --> 29:58.961
Ready.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.286
- Spartan?
- I'm set.

30:00.520 --> 30:01.567
<i>Let's do this.</i>

30:10.440 --> 30:11.680
Vixen, you're up.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.168
I'm guessing
your insurance won't pay for that.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.169
Cute. Buh-bye.

30:25.600 --> 30:29.161
When you're dead, I'll make sure
that totem gets put to better use.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.643
Took the words right out of my mouth.

30:42.080 --> 30:44.128
Well, that happened.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.170
Speedy, Canary, I can't get a clear shot.
Where are you?

30:51.360 --> 30:52.407
<i>On our way.</i>

31:17.040 --> 31:18.883
Find William. I'll take care of Darhk.

31:20.560 --> 31:24.042
I'm sorry. I can't hear you
with your throats closing up like that.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.561
Steady.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.847
I've got the totem.
Has it had any effect?

31:29.040 --> 31:30.007
Separating it from Darhk
didn't do anything.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.287
Go to plan B.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.164
What's plan B?

32:04.760 --> 32:05.841
Please don't hurt them.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.451
William.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.326
<i>Get</i> out of here.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.083
- Mom.
- William.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.401
Hi.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.003
Medics checked him out.
He's in perfect health.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.004
Oh, thank goodness.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.771
There's someone here
that you must have missed.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.521
What's wrong?

33:29.720 --> 33:30.846
I'm kind of over The Flash.

33:31.160 --> 33:33.162
I want a Green Arrow action figure.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.602
Well, the Green Arrow is pretty amazing.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.688
I will let you guys get reacquainted.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.361
Hey-

33:44.720 --> 33:45.687
ls everything okay?

33:45.880 --> 33:49.009
Detectives questioned William
while the docs were checking him out.

33:49.200 --> 33:52.204
Darhk didn't take him.
It was a guy with a missing hand.

34:02.880 --> 34:03.847
You son of a bitch.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.041
I assure you, Mr. Queen,

34:05.240 --> 34:07.925
I had all the faith in the world
that you would survive.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.849
Yeah? But what about everybody else?

34:10.040 --> 34:12.007
You are my only concern.

34:12.679 --> 34:14.523
We've gotten this far because of you.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.481
Let's finish it.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.405
<i>You too, Ms. Venediktov.</i>

34:19.600 --> 34:22.251
Mr. Queen seems to behave at his best
when you are around.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.567
- Is William gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

34:50.760 --> 34:52.091
He's a tough one.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.002
Just like his dad.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.328
Could not have done this without you.

34:59.480 --> 35:00.845
Thank you.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.371
Anytime.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.166
Have you thought any more
about what I said?

35:05.360 --> 35:07.488
You know, I just got him back.

35:07.680 --> 35:08.806
Let me just say,

35:09.040 --> 35:12.601
for all the frustrations I have
about my real parents giving me up,

35:13.760 --> 35:15.683
I am so grateful
I was raised in a situation

35:15.920 --> 35:18.002
where that was my biggest issue in life.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.565
The best thing my parents
ever gave me was that freedom.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.323
Well, that, and this totem
that makes me a total badass.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.291
You don't need a totem for that.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.286
Damn right, I don't.

35:32.160 --> 35:35.607
Take care of yourself, Oliver.
I'm just a phone call away.

35:36.240 --> 35:39.483
Me too, Mari. Me too.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.763
I heard you found the boy.
You can't believe how relieved I...

35:53.000 --> 35:54.684
- Cut the crap.
- Excuse me?

35:54.920 --> 35:58.891
I know it was you.
You took him. Out of spite.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.161
For us.

36:00.360 --> 36:02.328
You have to believe me. I did it for us.

36:02.520 --> 36:05.364
You purposely...
You put him in danger. How...

36:06.560 --> 36:07.607
You know what?

36:08.880 --> 36:10.928
I'm not doing this anymore.

36:11.120 --> 36:13.600
This song and dance
where you come over to my apartment

36:13.800 --> 36:15.723
and you whisper your lies...

36:15.920 --> 36:17.251
It is over.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.001
- Thea, I did it to protect us.
- Shut up.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.720
How could you possibly think
that there was an "us" to protect?

36:24.240 --> 36:26.288
<i>You know, sometimes I lay awake at night</i>

36:27.760 --> 36:30.525
and I wonder what Robert
would think about our relationship.

36:30.720 --> 36:34.042
He raised me. He loved me.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.801
And I threw that all away
the moment I became your daughter.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.520
Yes. Yes, you did. And it was your choice.

36:42.760 --> 36:44.728
And lwish I never did.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.002
Don't you dare speak to me like that.

36:47.200 --> 36:52.001
You would be dead 10 times over
if not for me.

36:53.160 --> 36:56.403
I taught you how to fight.
How to be strong.

36:56.600 --> 36:59.968
I turned you from
a delicate, spoiled brat into a warrior.

37:00.600 --> 37:04.571
And all I've ever gotten from you
in return is your venomous spite.

37:04.760 --> 37:06.603
For a very good reason.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.087
You have no idea what you are up against.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.760
You are incapable
of seeing the bigger picture,

37:12.000 --> 37:13.331
butlcan.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.280
And I would rather
you hate me and be alive,

37:17.480 --> 37:19.687
than love me and be dead.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.485
Hi, William.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.400
I hope you're well.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.450
And I hope you're safe.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.046
There is something that I wanna tell you.

37:38.520 --> 37:41.046
I wanted to tell you before, but...

37:44.720 --> 37:46.484
But this is better.

37:50.160 --> 37:54.290
I'm your father. Biologically, that is.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.284
As far as really being your father goes,

38:00.640 --> 38:02.244
I haven't earned that yet.

38:02.880 --> 38:08.250
<i>A father should be there for his child,
every day, no matter what.</i>

38:09.000 --> 38:12.971
<i>To make sure that they feel loved,
that they feel safe.</i>

38:13.320 --> 38:16.164
<i>And a child should be able
to rely on their father</i>

38:16.360 --> 38:21.161
<i>and go to him for
guidance and reassurance.</i>

38:23.680 --> 38:26.081
I have failed to do that for you.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.567
And now, I'm gonna tell you why.

38:35.200 --> 38:39.524
I'm the Green Arrow.
And my life is very dangerous.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.324
Which is why

38:42.600 --> 38:47.208
we decided to keep you out of it
for all of these years.

38:49.840 --> 38:54.641
What happened to you in Star City,
that was my fault.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.721
And I can't allow anything like that
to happen ever again.

39:02.280 --> 39:07.605
<i>That's why I have asked your mother
to move you far away,</i>

39:10.720 --> 39:12.643
and to not tell anyone
where she's taking you.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.410
Including me.

39:19.400 --> 39:22.563
That's also why I asked her to wait
to show you this message

39:24.960 --> 39:26.883
until after your 18th birthday.

39:31.320 --> 39:34.449
I wanted to give you a real childhood.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.243
I wanted to give you that gift.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.764
Goodbye, son.

39:47.280 --> 39:49.044
I sure hope it's not forever.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.088
How much of that did you hear?

40:00.520 --> 40:01.601
Enough.

40:03.640 --> 40:04.801
Oliver, we need to talk.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.726
About a number of things, I suspect.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.124
Let's start with...

40:18.960 --> 40:20.769
I can't do this.

40:21.360 --> 40:22.600
<i>When your son was in danger,</i>

40:22.800 --> 40:26.441
I had to table
what I was feeling about everything.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.930
But now that I've had some space,

40:30.280 --> 40:32.089
I realize I need space.

40:32.360 --> 40:33.407
Felicity.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.881
I know the position Samantha put you in.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.248
I know it was an impossible decision.

40:38.440 --> 40:42.161
But you were right,
you should have told me.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.288
Marriage is about inclusion.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.086
It's about

40:49.200 --> 40:53.967
leaning on your partner
when things get complicated.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.803
I don't think that
you know how to do that.

41:03.240 --> 41:04.321
I'm trying.

41:04.560 --> 41:09.248
And now you're sending William away
and I understand why.

41:10.360 --> 41:11.327
<i>You know that I do,</i>

41:11.520 --> 41:13.966
but once again,
you have left me out of the decision.

41:17.560 --> 41:18.800
Felicity?

41:29.880 --> 41:32.167
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

42:26.840 --> 42:27.841
English - SDH
