00:01.633 --> 00:02.833
No, no, no.

00:02.900 --> 00:04.966
Don't touch that dial.

00:05.033 --> 00:07.733
Here's what's on my mind
tonight.

00:10.266 --> 00:12.333
David Lander stars as Lenny.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.400
A lottery addict dying to win.

00:14.466 --> 00:16.200
Come on! Come on!
19.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.566
While his wife
plays other games.

00:18.633 --> 00:19.733
I killed him.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.233
But did Lenny die
with a winning ticket.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.266
Well, where is it?

00:23.333 --> 00:25.300
The suit that
Lenny was buried in.

00:25.366 --> 00:28.966
Or is his widow having
a $20,000,000 nightmare?

00:29.033 --> 00:30.400
Thanks a lot, guys.

00:30.466 --> 00:31.900
Find out on the next..

00:31.966 --> 00:33.166
She's my kinda ghoul.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.200
..."Freddy's Nightmares".

00:55.266 --> 00:57.800
If you're in Springwood now..

00:57.866 --> 00:59.633
...then you're all mine.

01:22.633 --> 01:23.700
'And the first number'

01:23.766 --> 01:27.000
'in our Super Lotto
jackpot draw is...six.'

01:27.066 --> 01:29.366
- Six! Yes!
- 'Number six.'

01:29.433 --> 01:31.800
'The second number is 14.'

01:31.866 --> 01:33.033
'That's one four.'

01:33.100 --> 01:34.566
Four. Come on, come on.

01:34.633 --> 01:36.633
Nineteen. One nine,
lucky 19.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.633
Come on, baby, 19.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.300
'Our third number is 19.'

01:41.366 --> 01:43.400
Yes! Yes!

01:43.466 --> 01:45.100
Hey, what is going on here?

01:45.166 --> 01:47.000
One more number
and we win $20,000,000.

01:47.066 --> 01:49.033
What?
Lenny, are you kidding me?

01:49.100 --> 01:51.033
Let me see the ticket.
W-what do we need?

01:51.100 --> 01:52.400
- 'And the final number..'
- Hush! It's the big one.

01:52.466 --> 01:54.133
Come on, come on.
Please, please.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.100
Give it to me, please.

01:56.166 --> 01:57.233
'Eighty eight!'

01:57.300 --> 01:59.833
Eighty eight! We win, we win!

02:01.166 --> 02:03.133
Twenty million dollars!

02:03.200 --> 02:04.433
Lenny, we're rich.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.166
We both are rich.

02:07.233 --> 02:09.233
'I love you, I love you,
I love you.'

02:13.400 --> 02:16.033
What did I tell you that
buying these stupid tickets..

02:16.100 --> 02:18.933
I'm sorry, Greta.
I really..

02:19.000 --> 02:20.933
You've been unemployed
for six months

02:21.000 --> 02:23.900
and you are throwing away
our money on these damn tickets.

02:23.966 --> 02:25.566
You're right. I swear
I'll never buy one ever again.

02:25.633 --> 02:27.100
Hey, as if you think
we're really gonna win

02:27.166 --> 02:28.366
somethin' with these things.

02:28.433 --> 02:30.666
No, no, no. You are,
you are absolutely right.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.300
It was really stupid.

02:32.366 --> 02:33.533
I'm telling you, Lenny.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.700
I can't live this way anymore.

02:35.766 --> 02:36.833
If you don't bring in
some money soon

02:36.900 --> 02:38.800
we're gonna lose the house
and then what?

02:38.866 --> 02:41.166
I-I know things have been
tough on ya.

02:41.233 --> 02:42.600
But, but things
are gonna change.

02:42.666 --> 02:44.300
I've been readin'
the "Classified"

02:44.366 --> 02:46.566
and, uh, well, there's
a whole new bunch of Ads

02:46.633 --> 02:48.233
and yes,
somebody's gotta hire me.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.333
You've been sayin'
that for six months.

02:51.933 --> 02:53.233
Whatever happened
to all that money

02:53.300 --> 02:55.233
you were supposed to inherit?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.533
Well, we're gonna get it.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.466
Soon, it's just that right now

02:58.533 --> 03:01.600
it's, uh, well, kinda tied up
in litigation.

03:01.666 --> 03:02.633
Anyway I don't even care

03:02.700 --> 03:04.233
if we don't get
a dime of that money.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.233
We can make it on our own.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.766
Oh, you'll see.

03:07.833 --> 03:09.433
You'll see.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.433
Someday I'm gonna make
all your dreams come true.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Please stop looking at me
like that.

03:20.466 --> 03:23.100
You are all I care about, Greta.

03:23.166 --> 03:24.800
If I lost you, I couldn't go on.

03:26.233 --> 03:28.600
Promise...you'll never leave me.

03:31.466 --> 03:33.700
- I promise.
- That's my girl.

03:34.766 --> 03:36.866
I love you.

03:36.933 --> 03:38.866
I love you too.
Now..

03:38.933 --> 03:41.400
N-now get out of here.

03:41.466 --> 03:43.866
'A-And don't come back
till you have a job.'

03:43.933 --> 03:45.933
Don't worry,
I won't let you down.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.533
Hello, young lovers.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.500
Whoever you are.

04:01.566 --> 04:02.666
Maybe I should say

04:02.733 --> 04:04.166
wherever you'll be

04:04.233 --> 04:06.533
'cause when I get done with
these two love birds..

04:09.466 --> 04:12.300
...there will be bits
and pieces everywhere.

04:20.433 --> 04:22.600
- 'Who is it?'
- 'Plumber.'

05:00.100 --> 05:02.366
No!

05:02.433 --> 05:04.600
"No", what do you mean?

05:04.666 --> 05:07.233
"No"..

05:07.300 --> 05:09.500
- I can't.
- What?

05:12.333 --> 05:14.300
Why not?

05:17.366 --> 05:19.333
You didn't tell him, did you?

05:20.700 --> 05:22.633
No.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.800
Baby..

05:25.866 --> 05:28.266
...you said that
you're finally gonna tell him.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.700
I-I couldn't.
It would break his heart.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.833
His heart?
Greta..

05:35.333 --> 05:37.700
...you don't love him.

05:37.766 --> 05:39.700
I know but..

05:42.800 --> 05:44.833
You love me.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.566
Oh!

06:07.633 --> 06:08.700
What, what's wrong?

06:08.766 --> 06:11.066
- Did you hear that?
- Hear, what?

06:11.133 --> 06:13.633
I-It sounded like
sort of a moaning.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.133
Are you sure, babe?

06:17.233 --> 06:18.533
Here it is again.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.733
Greta, you are hearing things.

06:22.933 --> 06:25.766
It's coming...from the closet.

06:25.833 --> 06:28.633
What you doin'?

06:28.700 --> 06:30.133
Are you nuts or what?

06:30.200 --> 06:32.500
Get back in bed.

06:43.266 --> 06:45.966
Lenny, what are you doing here?

06:46.033 --> 06:48.600
You broke my heart, Greta.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.166
Oh, God!

06:55.233 --> 06:57.833
It-it gets like this
all the time.

06:58.966 --> 07:01.000
I..

07:03.000 --> 07:04.933
Oh!

07:07.066 --> 07:09.333
Oh, no!

07:13.900 --> 07:15.000
Oh, my God.

07:15.066 --> 07:17.000
- You ready for round two, baby?
- No!

07:18.733 --> 07:20.033
What's with you, Greta?
Huh?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.566
Huh?

07:22.633 --> 07:24.600
Do you realize that you were
talkin' in your sleep again?

07:25.100 --> 07:26.333
About Lenny.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.166
- He was in my dream.
- Your dream.

07:28.233 --> 07:31.400
T-t, this, uh,
uh, guilt complex.

07:31.466 --> 07:33.333
Yeah that this is really
gettin' outta hand here.

07:34.266 --> 07:35.400
Do you hear what I'm sayin'?

07:36.966 --> 07:39.200
- I cannot handle this anymore.
- Hank, no!

07:39.266 --> 07:42.066
No, no, either you drop
that little twerp

07:42.133 --> 07:43.400
or you and me are history.

07:43.466 --> 07:45.133
I'll tell him tonight.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.700
When he comes home.

07:47.766 --> 07:49.866
Then what?

07:49.933 --> 07:51.933
Then..

07:54.566 --> 07:57.266
We'll live..

07:57.333 --> 07:59.333
...happily ever after.

08:11.633 --> 08:13.600
- Hank.
- Uh-huh.

08:14.366 --> 08:16.300
T-the phone's ringing.

08:16.366 --> 08:18.300
So what?

08:18.366 --> 08:20.500
So let me answer it.

08:29.933 --> 08:31.866
Hello.

08:31.933 --> 08:33.733
Yes, this is, um..

08:33.800 --> 08:39.766
This is Greta Nordhoff.

08:39.833 --> 08:41.800
Oh, what about my husband?

08:44.133 --> 08:45.833
Oh, my God.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.333
Oh, my God!

08:49.100 --> 08:50.566
What? What?

08:50.633 --> 08:52.833
Lenny just had
a massive heart attack.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.033
He's dead.

09:05.966 --> 09:08.433
This is too weird.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.600
Lenny just had a physical.

09:09.666 --> 09:11.933
The doctor said that
he was in perfect condition.

09:14.033 --> 09:16.000
Goes to show you
what doctors know, eh?

09:21.233 --> 09:23.733
Well, look, you know..

09:23.800 --> 09:25.033
If he had to go..

09:25.100 --> 09:27.033
...you got to admit
his timin' wasn't so bad.

09:27.933 --> 09:30.400
It's my fault.
I killed him.

09:31.133 --> 09:33.733
Sheesh..

09:33.800 --> 09:35.800
No, in my dream he was dead.

09:35.866 --> 09:37.166
He, he saw us making love

09:37.233 --> 09:39.800
and it broke his heart.

09:39.866 --> 09:42.666
Oh, there we go
with the dreams again.

09:42.733 --> 09:45.266
But what if that's what
really happened?

09:45.333 --> 09:46.566
What if, if Lenny found out

09:46.633 --> 09:49.133
that, that I was
cheating on him and..

09:49.200 --> 09:51.133
...it killed him.

09:53.133 --> 09:55.366
You know somethin', Greta?

09:55.433 --> 09:57.133
Maybe, uh..

09:58.433 --> 09:59.900
Maybe..

10:01.433 --> 10:04.566
Maybe, maybe you need to spend
couple of days with yourself.

10:04.633 --> 10:06.700
'You know what..
Get your head together.'

10:06.766 --> 10:08.333
I know, I know. Look, hon.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.100
I'm, I'm gonna
call you in a couple of days.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.833
- I..
- No. Hank, no.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.366
You can't leave me alone.

10:16.433 --> 10:18.533
Not now.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.900
I-I will be okay
once we burry Lenny.

10:21.966 --> 10:24.000
I'll forget all about him and..

10:24.066 --> 10:26.833
And then it'll be just
you and me.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.900
The way we always planned it.

10:30.866 --> 10:33.033
You still wanna marry me,
don't you, Hank?

10:34.066 --> 10:36.033
You're not having
second thoughts?

10:37.333 --> 10:39.300
Oh, you kid babe.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.400
I'm crazy about you.

10:54.100 --> 10:56.033
Mmm..

10:56.633 --> 10:58.566
Okay, honey.

10:58.633 --> 11:00.566
Listen, I am calling
the funeral home.

11:00.633 --> 11:02.733
We're making this short
and sweet, okay?

11:02.800 --> 11:04.733
- Yes?
- Yes!

11:04.800 --> 11:06.733
Yes, yes, yes.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.300
Well, I guess
this is it, Lenny.

11:43.766 --> 11:45.733
It was nice knowing you.

11:47.766 --> 11:49.700
I'm sorry if I wasn't
as good to you

11:49.766 --> 11:51.833
as I should have been.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.600
'You weren't really
such a bad guy after all.'

11:57.066 --> 11:58.233
'That's it?'

11:58.300 --> 11:59.633
That's the best you can do?

12:00.400 --> 12:03.200
I wasn't such a bad guy.

12:04.666 --> 12:07.466
'You never loved me,
did you, Greta?'

12:07.533 --> 12:09.566
And what did you see
in that other guy?

12:09.633 --> 12:10.633
What does Hank have

12:10.700 --> 12:12.733
that I...didn't?

12:13.766 --> 12:15.733
H-how do you know about Hank?

12:16.900 --> 12:18.833
'You saw us, didn't you?'

12:19.566 --> 12:21.533
What do you think?

12:24.033 --> 12:25.500
You know what, Greta.

12:25.566 --> 12:27.900
I want you to give somethin'
to Hank for me, would you?

12:29.066 --> 12:30.333
Give him my ring.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.833
No need for him to go out
and buy a new one.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.066
He just has to have

12:34.133 --> 12:36.100
'this one altered.'

12:38.766 --> 12:40.800
'My fingers are swelling
It's because of that'

12:40.866 --> 12:42.800
darn embalming fluid.

12:43.666 --> 12:46.700
But I won't be needing this..

12:46.766 --> 12:48.733
'...where I'm going.'

12:52.066 --> 12:55.066
Oh, Greta, Greta.
It's okay, baby.

12:55.133 --> 12:56.733
It's okay.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.133
It's all over.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.033
You can forget
all about Lenny.

13:06.466 --> 13:08.533
From now on, babe..

13:08.600 --> 13:10.533
...it's just you and me.

13:29.133 --> 13:30.866
'And to you, Greta,'

13:30.933 --> 13:33.266
'take this warm and wonderful'

13:33.333 --> 13:35.100
'human being'

13:35.166 --> 13:37.466
'to be your lawfully'

13:37.533 --> 13:40.300
wedded husband?

13:42.233 --> 13:43.833
I..

13:43.900 --> 13:46.066
And Greta,
do you take Hank Roscoe

13:46.133 --> 13:48.133
to be you lawfully
wedded husband?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.433
'Dear..'

13:53.500 --> 13:55.633
Huh, uh, I-I do.

13:55.700 --> 13:59.200
Then through the power vested
in me to our heavenly Father

13:59.266 --> 14:01.900
I pronounce you husband
and wife.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.533
You may kiss the bride.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.600
'Uh, congratulations.'

14:21.166 --> 14:23.133
Baby!

14:25.166 --> 14:26.933
This place is a pig sty.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.933
What did you say, honey?

14:30.866 --> 14:34.866
I said you're a filthy,
disgusting slob.

14:34.933 --> 14:37.233
At least Lenny cleaned up
once in a while.

14:37.866 --> 14:39.933
Lenny?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.333
Tell me something, honey.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.200
Why is it you still so hung up
on this, uh, little wimp?

14:44.266 --> 14:45.766
He's been dead for a month, huh.

14:45.833 --> 14:47.266
I'm not hung up on him,
it's just that I could

14:47.333 --> 14:49.300
use a little help now and then.

14:51.666 --> 14:53.900
- Is that a complaint?
- Huh!

14:53.966 --> 14:55.900
Don't be silly!

14:55.966 --> 14:58.233
I love cleaning up
after your hand and foot.

15:00.266 --> 15:03.266
Baby, what do you want from me?

15:03.333 --> 15:05.833
How about a little financial
security?

15:05.900 --> 15:09.100
You blew the last of Lenny's
insurance money at the track.

15:09.166 --> 15:10.900
We're broke, Hank.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.633
So?

15:12.700 --> 15:14.633
So what are we supposed
to live on?

15:17.400 --> 15:18.733
Sure as hell isn't love.

15:19.566 --> 15:21.533
Greta, wait, wait, baby.

15:23.533 --> 15:25.866
Bring me another beer.
Will you, please?

15:25.933 --> 15:28.066
He-he-he..
Honey!

15:28.133 --> 15:30.700
You know what, you are starting
to become a drag.

15:30.766 --> 15:32.733
Definitely.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.100
'And another news today.'

15:41.166 --> 15:43.233
'The fire department is asking'

15:43.300 --> 15:44.800
'Springwood residents'

15:44.866 --> 15:48.600
'to be extra careful from fire
in the upcoming month.'

15:48.666 --> 15:50.800
'The recent dry spell
has left Springwood'

15:50.866 --> 15:53.233
'extremely fire prone.'

15:53.300 --> 15:56.200
I'm sorry, baby!

15:56.266 --> 15:58.300
'What their asking
is that we all keep a close..'

16:01.100 --> 16:03.033
You know, I-I-I was
planning on

16:03.100 --> 16:05.033
goin' back to work,
you know, it's just..

16:08.700 --> 16:10.233
How do you know to get rid
of this cold here?

16:10.300 --> 16:14.300
'Springwood Zoo's
"Tiny" turned five today..'

16:14.366 --> 16:16.300
Do you mind doing
that some place else?

16:16.366 --> 16:19.266
'It was a special
birthday meal..'

16:19.333 --> 16:22.200
Come on, why don't
we just kiss and make up?

16:22.266 --> 16:23.833
Oh, come on!

16:25.900 --> 16:29.600
'It weighs in at 205 pounds..'

16:31.466 --> 16:32.466
- Do you mind?
- What?

16:32.533 --> 16:33.766
I was listening to the news.

16:33.833 --> 16:35.333
'As in the state capital..'

16:35.400 --> 16:37.400
'Today,
lottery officials reported'

16:37.466 --> 16:40.233
'that they still haven't heard
from the winner in last month'

16:40.300 --> 16:42.766
'twenty million dollar
Super Lotto draw.'

16:42.833 --> 16:45.900
'If no one claims the jackpot by
midnight tonight..'

16:45.966 --> 16:47.533
'...the money will..'

16:49.266 --> 16:50.900
'Records indicate that
the winning ticket'

16:50.966 --> 16:52.966
'was purchased right here
in Springwood.'

16:53.033 --> 16:55.300
'So once again those
lucky numbers are'

16:55.366 --> 16:58.033
'six, fourteen, nineteen'

16:58.100 --> 17:00.966
'and eighty eight.'

17:01.033 --> 17:03.600
That was the day
that Lenny and me got married.

17:03.666 --> 17:06.733
- What're you talkin' about?
- June 14th, 1988.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.166
'If you win that ticket, you've
them till midnight tonight'

17:09.233 --> 17:11.666
'to contact the lottery
commission.'

17:11.733 --> 17:14.233
'And now for an update for
the five day weather forecast.'

17:16.633 --> 17:18.600
That's were the numbers
that Lenny always got.

17:18.666 --> 17:20.600
They were his lucky numbers.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.800
You're saying,
he bought that ticket?

17:27.366 --> 17:29.300
Yeah.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.233
Well..

17:31.300 --> 17:33.233
...where the hell is it?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.333
I can't find it anyplace.

17:50.533 --> 17:51.500
It ain't in here.

17:51.566 --> 17:53.000
I don't know where else to look.

17:53.066 --> 17:54.133
- Did you check the garage?
- Yes.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.866
- The car? The laundry room?
- Yes, yes.

17:55.933 --> 17:57.966
But I'm telling you it's gone
I must have thrown it out

17:58.033 --> 17:59.000
I mean, who would have
thought of it?

17:59.066 --> 18:00.200
W-w-wait..

18:00.266 --> 18:02.300
When was the last time
you saw the ticket?

18:03.233 --> 18:04.600
T-the morning that Lenny died.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.833
Good. Where was it?

18:06.900 --> 18:09.333
- Uh.
- W-what room were you in?

18:10.100 --> 18:12.633
Look, close your eyes.

18:12.700 --> 18:13.933
Retrace your steps.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.733
It'll come back.

18:19.733 --> 18:21.300
...get a dime of that money.

18:21.366 --> 18:23.800
We can make it on our own.
You'll see.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.500
Lenny put it in his pocket
just before he left.

18:30.566 --> 18:32.500
What pocket?
What was he wearin'?

18:32.566 --> 18:34.566
The pocket of his suit.

18:34.633 --> 18:35.933
And where is it?

18:38.233 --> 18:41.033
Greta, do not tell me
you threw it away.

18:45.133 --> 18:47.600
It's in the suit
that Lenny was..

18:47.666 --> 18:49.800
...buried in.

18:49.866 --> 18:51.800
Huh?

19:19.966 --> 19:22.066
Ready?

19:22.133 --> 19:24.100
I guess so.

19:25.933 --> 19:27.900
Open sesame.

19:42.933 --> 19:45.633
Thank you, Lenny.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.700
Don't mention it.

19:49.300 --> 19:50.900
Where are you going?

19:50.966 --> 19:53.033
Hank? Help!

19:54.033 --> 19:57.066
You promised
you'd never leave me.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.500
Thanks a lot, guys.

20:01.566 --> 20:04.866
Hank, where are you going?
Come back, Hank.

20:04.933 --> 20:07.300
Don't go!

20:09.200 --> 20:11.300
Baby? You okay?

20:11.366 --> 20:13.533
Yeah. Yeah. I-I'm fine.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.100
I-I just dozed off, that's all.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.566
Yeah, it sounded
like you were having

20:18.633 --> 20:20.600
another one of those dreams.

20:38.033 --> 20:39.966
'Okay.'

20:40.033 --> 20:42.366
'I think the coast is clear.'

20:42.433 --> 20:44.000
- Hank?
- What?

20:44.066 --> 20:46.900
H-Hank, I-I'm-I'm not sure
that this is such a good idea.

20:47.966 --> 20:49.133
What do you mean?

20:49.200 --> 20:51.133
You were positive the ticket
was in his pocket.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.400
Well, yeah, I am,
but it's just that..

20:52.466 --> 20:53.866
But what?

20:53.933 --> 20:55.133
All of a sudden,
you don't wanna be rich?

20:55.200 --> 20:56.500
- Well, of course, I do, but..
- Then let's go.

20:56.566 --> 20:58.533
Come on, 'cause half
this 20 million is mine.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.433
What're you talkin' about?

21:00.500 --> 21:02.500
Community property, babe.

21:02.566 --> 21:04.600
We split right down the middle.

22:20.700 --> 22:22.433
Alright, so, uh..

22:24.633 --> 22:26.600
...where is he?

23:01.900 --> 23:04.033
Looks like
our lucky stiff, huh?

23:05.533 --> 23:07.500
Well, how's it goin', Lenny?

23:11.033 --> 23:13.100
Must get kind of lonely
in here, huh?

23:22.833 --> 23:24.800
I hope you're not ticklish, pal.

23:38.933 --> 23:41.300
You're, uh... gonna get
a big chunk.

23:41.366 --> 23:43.300
'Huh!'

23:44.066 --> 23:46.000
Like a cookie?

23:46.066 --> 23:48.033
You're really sick,
you know that?

23:51.400 --> 23:52.433
Cookie..

23:52.500 --> 23:54.466
It's just that right now,
it's, uh..

23:54.533 --> 23:57.600
It was kind of tied up
in-in litigation..

23:58.666 --> 24:00.000
Um..

24:00.066 --> 24:02.666
Wh-why-why don't you
check his pants?

24:02.733 --> 24:05.233
- The back pockets.
- His pants?.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.500
Yeah. Yeah, I think
I got somethin'.

24:12.566 --> 24:13.900
- I think I got it.
- 'You do?'

24:13.966 --> 24:16.533
Yeah. Yeah. Here.

24:18.266 --> 24:20.700
"Inspected by number 17."
Damn!

24:23.366 --> 24:25.500
Hey-get.. Wa-wait..
Get over here with that.

24:25.566 --> 24:26.600
Come on.

24:28.833 --> 24:31.800
Oh. Come on, Lenny, Lenny.

24:31.866 --> 24:32.933
Lenny..

24:35.733 --> 24:37.233
Nothin' here, babe.

24:37.300 --> 24:40.100
It's not here.
I've checked all the pockets.

24:40.166 --> 24:42.100
Well, any other bright ideas?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.333
Just one..

24:45.400 --> 24:47.333
...babe!

25:00.900 --> 25:03.233
So much for community property

25:03.300 --> 25:05.333
you greedy bastard!

25:06.700 --> 25:09.700
'Let me outta here.'

25:09.766 --> 25:13.333
Sorry, Hank.
I always hated having to share.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.766
Especially with a scum-ball
like you.

25:15.833 --> 25:17.866
'I can't breathe. Greta!'

25:17.933 --> 25:20.900
'Greta! Greta-a-a!'

25:41.766 --> 25:43.733
Yes!

25:55.300 --> 25:57.900
Hello? Lottery Commission.

25:59.033 --> 26:01.233
You'll never guess
what I just found.

26:05.433 --> 26:07.366
'Oops!'

26:07.433 --> 26:09.866
Oh, my, my, my

26:09.933 --> 26:13.200
caught with my hand
in the cookie jar.

26:14.366 --> 26:18.500
Nothing satisfies my sweet tooth
like a sweet..

26:20.166 --> 26:22.100
..heart.
Ha ha ha.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.733
Pump it up.

26:51.766 --> 26:53.700
Greta?

26:53.766 --> 26:57.066
Hank? You're alive.

26:57.133 --> 27:00.433
Looking for something,&lt;c

27:11.366 --> 27:13.333
You buried me alive

27:13.400 --> 27:15.333
and now it's your turn.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.333
Sweet dreams.

27:21.133 --> 27:24.366
So long, Greta. Rest in peace.

27:27.666 --> 27:30.633
Let me out. Let me out!

27:33.433 --> 27:36.600
Mrs. Roscoe, everything's
alright. I'm here.

27:36.666 --> 27:39.966
- Everything's alright.
- Lucy, it's you.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.733
You're having a bad dream, eh?

27:41.800 --> 27:43.833
Yes. Yes, I was.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.566
'Well, I'll fix you some
nice hot milk, okay?'

27:45.633 --> 27:46.600
Oh, no.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.200
Don't really? I-I'll be fine.

27:48.266 --> 27:50.533
- You sure?
- Yes. Thanks.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.533
Positive.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.233
What do we have today?

27:55.300 --> 27:56.666
Well, let's see, um..

27:56.733 --> 27:58.733
You're due
for a fitting at The Faria.

27:58.800 --> 28:02.033
and then you were gonna
test drive that new Maserati.

28:02.100 --> 28:06.100
Hmm. That seems like
such a waste of time.

28:06.166 --> 28:07.333
Why don't you just
call the dealer

28:07.400 --> 28:08.466
and tell him we'll take it

28:08.533 --> 28:10.000
Fine. Is there anything else?

28:10.066 --> 28:12.366
Yes, would you please run me
a nice hot tub?

28:12.433 --> 28:13.900
I'll get it started right away.

28:13.966 --> 28:16.866
- Thanks, Lucy.
- 'Oh, I almost forgot.'

28:16.933 --> 28:18.400
While you were asleep

28:18.466 --> 28:20.400
you received
a rather unusual phone call.

28:20.466 --> 28:21.533
Really? Who was it?

28:21.600 --> 28:23.366
A man who said
he was your husband.

28:23.433 --> 28:24.933
My husband?

28:25.000 --> 28:26.366
'I told him
he must be mistaken.'

28:26.433 --> 28:27.966
It must have been
a wrong number.

28:28.033 --> 28:30.166
I just thought you should know.

28:30.233 --> 28:32.200
Thank you, Lucy.

28:42.566 --> 28:45.466
Hey, you!
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you!

28:45.533 --> 28:47.500
Get over here!

28:47.566 --> 28:49.800
I said get over here!

28:51.900 --> 28:53.066
Better, chump.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.133
You know,
they say that money

28:56.200 --> 28:58.800
is the root of all evil.

28:58.866 --> 29:00.933
Oh, no wonder I love it so much.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.466
I love you! I love you!
I love you!

29:04.533 --> 29:07.033
Now, Greta would do anything.
She'd-she'd lie..

29:07.100 --> 29:09.100
Sh-she-she'd kill..

29:09.166 --> 29:13.466
...to get her scummy little
hands on a stack of bills.

29:13.533 --> 29:16.166
Me? I'd uh..
I'd do all that for free.

29:26.033 --> 29:28.000
Your bath's ready, Mrs. Roscoe.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.666
Thank you, Lucy.

29:30.733 --> 29:32.366
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

29:32.433 --> 29:33.933
Thank you, Mrs. Roscoe.

29:39.133 --> 29:40.833
'Will that be all, Mrs. Roscoe?'

29:45.966 --> 29:48.066
Oh, Lucy, please call me Greta.

29:48.133 --> 29:51.066
I hate being so formal
around the house.

29:51.133 --> 29:53.900
Oh, whatever you say
Mrs.. Greta.

29:53.966 --> 29:55.166
Is that hot enough for you?

29:55.233 --> 29:58.600
It's divine, Lucy.
Simply divine.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.266
Well, I'll get your breakfast
started right away.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.200
'Oh, and Lucy?'

30:02.266 --> 30:04.500
If that man calls..

30:04.566 --> 30:06.100
...the one who says
he's my husband..

30:06.166 --> 30:08.200
Well, I was sure
it was just a wrong number.

30:08.266 --> 30:10.333
Just in case..

30:10.400 --> 30:12.333
I would like
to talk with him.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.566
But why? Your husband's dead.

30:14.633 --> 30:16.800
'My first husband is dead.'

30:16.866 --> 30:18.800
Oh, there were two?

30:18.866 --> 30:20.800
Unfortunately, yes.

30:21.966 --> 30:24.933
I try to forget
I ever met the hairball.

30:27.166 --> 30:29.100
He was a plumber.

30:29.966 --> 30:31.900
I married him after Lenny died.

30:31.966 --> 30:35.633
He disappeared shortly
before I won the lottery.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.933
But I haven't heard from him
in months.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.933
Well, whatever happened to him?

30:42.766 --> 30:44.566
Nothing's on him, babe.

30:44.633 --> 30:47.300
It's-it's not in here.
I've checked all the pockets.

30:47.366 --> 30:49.500
Well? Any other bright ideas?

30:50.266 --> 30:52.633
Just one..

30:52.700 --> 30:54.866
...babe!

30:54.933 --> 30:56.900
'Greta-a-a!'

30:58.233 --> 31:01.500
I haven't the slightest idea
what happened to him.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.033
And frankly, I could care less.

31:06.100 --> 31:08.166
I may be lucky
when it comes to the lottery

31:08.233 --> 31:10.900
but not when it comes to men.

31:10.966 --> 31:13.466
But I've learnt
from my mistakes, Lucy.

31:13.533 --> 31:16.366
Two bad marriages
is enough for me.

31:16.433 --> 31:18.700
I'm a bachelorette for life.

31:18.766 --> 31:20.700
Can't say I blame you.

31:20.766 --> 31:22.800
Men are such a pain.

31:22.866 --> 31:24.033
Enjoy your bath.

31:24.100 --> 31:26.033
And if there's anything
you need, just call.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.933
Mm.

32:10.066 --> 32:11.700
Mrs. Roscoe, what is it?
What's wrong?

32:26.766 --> 32:28.933
Oh, yuck!

32:29.000 --> 32:31.033
God! That water's disgusting!

32:34.433 --> 32:35.566
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Roscoe.

32:35.633 --> 32:37.266
I had no idea '
the water was like that.

32:37.333 --> 32:39.800
The pipes must be rusty
or something.

32:39.866 --> 32:42.000
You relax and go back to bed.
I'll call a plumber.

33:00.233 --> 33:03.533
Lucy! Lucy, answer the phone.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.066
Hello?

33:13.133 --> 33:14.933
'Greta Roscoe, please?'

33:15.000 --> 33:16.433
This is Greta Roscoe.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.966
'Mrs. Roscoe, this is
Detective Oswald'

33:19.033 --> 33:21.200
'Springwood PD.'

33:21.266 --> 33:23.533
U-uh, wh-what can I do
for you, detective?

33:24.166 --> 33:25.500
'I'm not sure.'

33:25.566 --> 33:27.400
'See, we were wonderin'
if you could help us'

33:27.466 --> 33:29.433
'determine the whereabouts
of your husband.'

33:30.033 --> 33:31.500
Hank?

33:31.566 --> 33:34.233
Well, I haven't seen him
in months.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.700
'Is that so?'

33:35.766 --> 33:37.800
'He's made no attempt
to contact you?'

33:38.833 --> 33:41.100
No!

33:41.166 --> 33:44.400
Listen, detective, this really
isn't a very good time to call.

33:44.466 --> 33:46.433
Why don't you try tomorrow?

33:49.733 --> 33:51.700
He's not alive.

33:52.766 --> 33:54.733
He can't be!

34:05.233 --> 34:07.800
I told you
to call back tomorrow!

34:07.866 --> 34:09.233
'I beg your pardon?'

34:10.266 --> 34:11.200
Who is this?

34:11.266 --> 34:12.400
'Mrs. Roscoe?'

34:12.466 --> 34:14.833
'Herman Glimpsure, Springwood,
savings loan.'

34:14.900 --> 34:18.666
Oh, Herman. I-I'm sorry,
I thought you were someone else.

34:18.733 --> 34:20.900
'I was just calling to tell you
that your transaction'

34:20.966 --> 34:22.433
'has been completed.'

34:24.033 --> 34:26.900
What transaction?

34:26.966 --> 34:30.433
'Mrs. Roscoe, your husband just
withdrew $20 million from..'

34:30.500 --> 34:32.800
My husband? That's impossible.

34:34.166 --> 34:36.933
Thought you're gonna pull
a fast one on me, baby?

34:37.866 --> 34:39.166
What do you want?

34:39.233 --> 34:41.700
Oh, I got what I want, baby.

34:42.966 --> 34:45.533
I just came by to say&lt;TO2

34:48.233 --> 34:51.466
Greta! I knew
you'd come back to me.

35:08.266 --> 35:11.300
Hello? Hello?

35:11.366 --> 35:13.566
'Springwood savings loan,
Herman Glimpsure speaking.'

35:13.633 --> 35:15.566
This is Greta Roscoe.

35:15.633 --> 35:17.566
Was any money
withdrawn from my account?

35:17.633 --> 35:20.500
'Why, no.
Not to my knowledge.'

35:20.566 --> 35:22.733
'Let me check.'

35:22.800 --> 35:24.233
'Everything's in order,
Mrs. Roscoe.'

35:24.300 --> 35:25.666
'Your money is safe and sound.'

35:25.733 --> 35:27.666
Thank God!

35:27.733 --> 35:29.666
'Was there anything else?'

35:29.733 --> 35:31.666
No, no, tha-that was all.

35:31.733 --> 35:34.800
'By the way, I'm looking forward
to meeting Mr. Roscoe.'

35:36.733 --> 35:39.033
- Mr. Roscoe?
- 'Why, yes.'

35:39.100 --> 35:41.366
'Your husband just called
to talk about investing'

35:41.433 --> 35:43.366
'some of your venture capital.'

35:43.433 --> 35:45.400
'We set up a meeting
for next week.'

35:47.633 --> 35:49.833
You're supposed to be dead,
you bastard.

36:37.933 --> 36:39.900
Hello?

36:45.966 --> 36:47.933
Hank?

36:58.900 --> 37:00.933
Hello?

37:14.866 --> 37:16.800
Hank?

37:40.800 --> 37:42.900
This isn't very funny, Hank.

38:02.366 --> 38:04.333
Hank?

38:15.066 --> 38:17.000
It's just me, Mrs. Roscoe.

38:17.066 --> 38:19.933
Oh, God! Lucy, you scared me
half to death.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.933
What were you looking for?

38:22.000 --> 38:22.933
Nothing, I..

38:23.000 --> 38:25.200
...I was just turning off
the shower.

38:27.866 --> 38:29.866
Why don't you
come with me, Lucy?

38:29.933 --> 38:31.900
I wanna show you something.

38:43.900 --> 38:47.000
- Have you seen this man?
- No, not that I remember.

38:47.600 --> 38:48.700
Think hard.

38:48.766 --> 38:50.633
No, I've never seen him
before in my life.

38:50.700 --> 38:51.900
Liar!

38:51.966 --> 38:53.400
You're in arms with him,
aren't you?

38:53.466 --> 38:55.100
Mrs. Roscoe, I swear, I don't
know what you're talkin' about.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.000
Do you expect me
to believe that?

38:57.066 --> 38:59.166
Get out of my house,
you little tramp.

38:59.233 --> 39:01.233
Now!

39:10.966 --> 39:12.933
You, son of a bitch!

39:14.333 --> 39:18.300
I hate you, I hate you,
I hate you, I hate you!

39:26.700 --> 39:28.966
- Hey, babe.
- No!

39:29.033 --> 39:30.766
No, no.

39:30.833 --> 39:33.000
Oh, aah, ow, ah!

39:33.533 --> 39:35.666
You, damn. Ah!

39:38.466 --> 39:39.966
Where're you going, babe?

39:44.500 --> 39:46.033
Oh.

39:48.166 --> 39:50.100
Oh!

39:54.533 --> 39:56.866
Police, there's
someone at my house.

39:56.933 --> 39:58.466
He's trying to kill me.

39:58.533 --> 40:01.333
Yeah, 59/56 Maplewood Drive.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.333
Hurry!

40:22.533 --> 40:25.333
And guess who's back?

40:25.400 --> 40:27.333
Oh!

40:50.600 --> 40:52.533
Oh.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.200
Oh.

41:18.900 --> 41:20.833
Lucy!

41:21.866 --> 41:23.933
Lucy, is that you?

41:46.933 --> 41:48.333
I'm warning you.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.333
Whoever's down there,
I've called the police.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.333
They're on their way.

41:57.366 --> 42:00.966
Hank!

42:01.033 --> 42:03.966
I-i-it's not what you think.

42:04.033 --> 42:05.200
Listen, Hank, uh.

42:05.266 --> 42:08.100
Uh, I'm willing to cut a deal.

42:08.166 --> 42:10.033
''How much, how much
do you want?'

42:10.100 --> 42:11.200
'Ten million?'

42:11.266 --> 42:12.266
'Fifteen, uh?'

42:12.333 --> 42:13.333
Ha ha ha.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.066
Why am I being so selfish?

42:15.133 --> 42:17.100
You can have it all.

42:18.233 --> 42:19.766
Oh!

42:19.833 --> 42:22.200
Standin' pretty straight corpse.

42:22.266 --> 42:23.766
Who are you?

42:23.833 --> 42:25.833
I work at the cemetery.

42:25.900 --> 42:27.866
I'm a grave digger.

42:27.933 --> 42:30.100
Just like you.

42:30.166 --> 42:32.200
What are you talking about?

42:32.266 --> 42:33.733
I've seen you, missy.

42:33.800 --> 42:36.866
You and that other fella
foolin' around the mausoleum.

42:36.933 --> 42:39.666
Oh, he wasn't with you
when you come out.

42:39.733 --> 42:42.666
I didn't think nothin'
about it at first.

42:42.733 --> 42:45.966
Then when I've seen
your picture in the paper.

42:46.033 --> 42:47.966
...winnin' all that money.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.833
I got to figurin'..

42:49.900 --> 42:53.100
Maybe there were
two stiffs in that tomb.

42:53.166 --> 42:55.533
And so I opened her up.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.833
And sure enough..

42:57.900 --> 42:59.833
...I was right.

43:00.666 --> 43:02.600
So, uh..

43:02.666 --> 43:05.233
You were the one who made
all those phone calls.

43:05.300 --> 43:07.733
Spook you real good...huh?

43:09.633 --> 43:10.633
And now you, uh..

43:10.700 --> 43:12.933
...wanna blackmail me,
is that it?

43:14.966 --> 43:18.733
That ain't exactly
what I had in mind.

43:18.800 --> 43:21.866
Then what's all this about?

43:21.933 --> 43:24.766
I got a proposal for you.

43:24.833 --> 43:27.300
A proposal?

43:30.500 --> 43:33.766
You can keep all your money.

43:33.833 --> 43:37.533
And I won't breathe
a word to the police.

43:37.600 --> 43:40.366
Provided you..

43:40.433 --> 43:42.200
...become my wife.

43:42.266 --> 43:44.533
Your wife?

43:44.600 --> 43:47.166
Me...marry you?

43:47.233 --> 43:49.533
You must be crazy.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.533
Yeah, I'm crazy.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.666
Crazy like a fox.

43:53.733 --> 43:55.666
Ha ha ha.

44:23.033 --> 44:24.966
I'm one hell of a match maker.

44:25.033 --> 44:27.633
If I do say so of myself.

44:27.700 --> 44:30.966
Actually, I was sorta hopin'
Greta would stay single.

44:31.033 --> 44:33.033
She's my kinda ghoul.
Ha ha ha ha.

44:34.066 --> 44:35.566
Oh, ah.

44:35.633 --> 44:38.100
Oh, boy, it looks like I'm next.

44:38.166 --> 44:41.066
Better start lookin'
for a bride.

44:41.133 --> 44:42.533
She loves me.

44:42.600 --> 44:44.333
She loves me not.

44:44.400 --> 44:46.400
She loves me.
