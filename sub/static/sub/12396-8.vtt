- A MILD CONCUSSION?

09:48.950 --> 09:50.986
- HEY, HOW DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT THAT?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.910
- DUDE, WHEN I LEFI' THE WEDDING
LAST NIGHT,

09:53.020 --> 09:53.918
THESE WERE ALL GONE.

09:54.020 --> 09:54.952
DO YOU MIND?

09:55.060 --> 09:56.288
- [laughs]
GET UP IN THERE.

09:56.390 --> 09:57.322
- WHAT?

09:57.430 --> 09:58.886
- YEAH, IT WAS FUNNY.

10:00.230 --> 10:01.993
WAS THAT SILLY BISCOTI'I WRAPPER.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.864
YEAH, THOSE THINGS ARE MADE
WITH EDIBLE GOLD DUST.

10:04.970 --> 10:06.790
- [spits]

10:06.900 --> 10:09.801
DUDE, YOU KNOW I'M ALLERGIC
TO GOLD DUST.

10:09.910 --> 10:10.763
REMEMBER IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL

10:10.870 --> 10:13.179
I HAD TO SIT AT
THE GOLD DUST-FREE TABLE?

10:13.280 --> 10:16.704
- I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER
GRAMMAR SCHOOL, GUS.

10:16.810 --> 10:19.711
MY HEAD HURTS FOR SOME REASON.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.344
HEY!

10:24.020 --> 10:24.987
YOU ALL RIGHT?

10:25.090 --> 10:26.785
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:26.890 --> 10:27.959
- WOULD YOU LIKE SOME BISCO'I'I'I

10:28.060 --> 10:29.823
WITH REAL PIECES OF GOLD IN IT?

10:29.930 --> 10:31.352
- SHAWN, HOW CAN YOU NOT THINK
THIS IS A BIG DEAL?

10:31.460 --> 10:36.159
- UM, I-I-I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE
MAKING TOO MUCH OF THIS.

10:36.260 --> 10:39.024
- OUR ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP
IS BASED ON LIES.

10:39.130 --> 10:39.937
- AND LAUGHTER,

10:40.040 --> 10:42.338
AND LASER TAG,
AND LOVE.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.362
- BUT YOU KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH
TO KNOW HOW I FEEL.

10:44.470 --> 10:47.030
ESPECIALLY AFI'ER EVERYTHING
I WENT THROUGH WITH MY DAD.

10:47.140 --> 10:49.028
HONESTY IS EVERYTHING TO ME,
SHAWN.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.869
IT'S THE ONLY THING.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.402
- MR. SPENCER.

10:52.510 --> 10:55.775
- [clears throat]

10:55.880 --> 10:59.111
[quietly] YOU'RE--YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TELL ANYONE ABOUT THE--

10:59.220 --> 11:01.188
- DON'T WORRY.

11:01.290 --> 11:03.087
IS THAT ALL CARE ABOUT?

11:05.060 --> 11:07.221
- SO CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE
ON THIS GIRL.

11:07.330 --> 11:10.060
- SURE, CHIEF.
THIS IS A JANE DOE.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.922
AND THE DOCTOR STITCHED UP
SOME KNIFE WOUNDS

11:12.030 --> 11:13.759
THAT THEY SAID WERE
ASYM M ETRICAL.

11:13.870 --> 11:15.235
- BOWIE KNIFE WILL DO THAT.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.331
WE RECOVERED THE BODY OF
AN ERIK PALMA THE OTHER DAY.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.204
HE'D BEEN SHOT, BUT HE ALSO HAD
THOSE TELLTALE BOWIE MARKINGS.

11:20.310 --> 11:21.971
LOVE THAT KNIFE.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.172
COULD BE A LINK.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.770
- DO YOU GET ANY FEELINGS ABOUT
THIS GIRL

11:24.880 --> 11:25.949
OTHER THAN THE PLACE
YOU FOUND HER?

11:26.050 --> 11:28.211
- UH...

11:28.320 --> 11:32.882
SHE--SHE SEEMED NICE.

11:32.990 --> 11:34.787
HER SHOES ARE SUPER DOPE.

11:34.890 --> 11:37.427
- I MEAN, ARE YOU GETTING
ANY PSYCHIC SENSATIONS?

11:37.530 --> 11:40.897
- [laughs]
OF COURSE. UM...

11:41.000 --> 11:42.865
UM...

11:42.970 --> 11:45.359
- BIFLOD. BIFLOD.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.734
- UH, YES,
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.764
I BELIEVE WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A BEEF LOG,

11:50.870 --> 11:52.030
OR, UH, A BRATWURST.

11:52.140 --> 11:55.029
POSSIBLY A SALAMI CHUB.

11:55.140 --> 11:56.903
- HE HAS A MILD CONCUSSION.

11:56.950 --> 11:57.109
- MAYBE I SHOULD JUST TAKE YOU
ALL TO WHERE I FOUND HER.

12:02.550 --> 12:04.484
- SO I SAID, "IT'S RAINING MEN?

12:04.590 --> 12:07.252
HEY, LET'S OPEN THE ROOF
AND STAY IN BED."

12:07.360 --> 12:09.055
- [fake laugh]
THAT IS A GREAT STORY.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.856
AND LOOK WHO FINALLY SHOWS UP.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.097
WITH A DOG, NO LESS.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.761
- THIS IS NEW LASSIE.
- DON'T NAME IT.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.292
- JUST AS WE WERE CONNECTING.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.936
WELL, BACK TO WORK.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.838
OKAY.
THIS BODY CAME IN LAST NIGHT.

12:22.940 --> 12:23.907
BASIC JANE DOE.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.331
DEATH CAUSED BY BLOOD LOSS
DUE TO LACERATIONS.

12:26.440 --> 12:27.976
- THAT IS SOME CLASSIC
BOWIE KNIFE ACTION

12:28.080 --> 12:29.308
FOR YOU RIGHT THERE.

12:29.410 --> 12:30.308
HONEY OF A WEAPON.

12:30.410 --> 12:31.900
IT BUILT THE WEST.

12:31.950 --> 12:32.109
- THERE WAS A BODY FOUND
THE OTHER DAY

12:33.580 --> 12:34.979
WITH SIMILAR KNIFE INJURIES

12:35.080 --> 12:36.342
WHO'D ALSO BEEN SHOT.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.042
AN ERIK PALMA.

12:38.150 --> 12:39.014
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THERE'S A LINK.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.815
- SAID MY LI'I'I'LE SUPER COP.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.148
- [laughs]
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:42.260 --> 12:43.955
STOP--STOP IT!
[dog whimpers]

12:44.060 --> 12:45.129
- LASSIE, NO.

12:45.230 --> 12:46.356
- DON'T NAME IT!
[dog barks]

12:46.460 --> 12:47.859
- CARLTON, CURB YOUR DOG.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.469
- HMM. LIKES DEAD BODIES.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.265
MAYBE HE'LL TURN OUT TO BE
A CADAVER DOG.

12:53.370 --> 12:54.496
- IS THAT THE REASON

12:54.600 --> 12:55.931
THERE WERE NO GIFT BAGS
LEFI' FOR ME?

12:56.040 --> 12:57.769
- DAMN IT, STRODE,
IT WAS ONE PER GUEST.

12:57.870 --> 13:00.771
- OH.
WELL, THERE WERE NO SIGNS.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.074
BISCO'I'I'I?

13:02.180 --> 13:04.000
- TECH NICALLY,
THESE ARE MINE.

13:04.110 --> 13:05.873
- HEY, THAT'S
THE SAME CHINA PATTERN

13:05.980 --> 13:06.969
THAT MARLOWE AND I
REGISTERED FOR.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.513
- REALLY?
[laughs]

13:08.620 --> 13:11.418
THAT--THAT IS WHAT WE CALL
A COINKY-DINK.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.544
- LOOK, WHY DON'T
THE FOUR OF YOU--

13:12.590 --> 13:13.113
OKAY, THE FIVE OF YOU
GO BACK TO WHERE WE FOUND

13:16.020 --> 13:17.521
THIS GIRL'S BODY
AND INVESTIGATE?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.052
- [laughs]
SOUNDS GREAT, CHIEF.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.422
COME ON, SWEETHEART.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.054
- YOU KNOW, LASSIE,

13:22.160 --> 13:23.525
I THINK I'M ALLERGIC
TO YOUR DOG.

13:23.630 --> 13:26.793
I'M STARTING TO ITCH.
- IT'S NOT MY DOG.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.800
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, SPENCER?
YOUR THIRD EYE BLIND?

13:32.910 --> 13:35.071
- LET'S ALL REMEMBER
HE HAS A SLIGHT CONCUSSION.

13:35.180 --> 13:36.499
- LOOK, I KNOW SHE WAS HERE,
OKAY?

13:36.610 --> 13:38.874
RIGHT HERE ON THIS ROAD.

13:38.980 --> 13:41.915
I JUST CAN'T SENSE WHAT
DIRECTION SHE CAME FROM.

13:41.950 --> 13:42.109
I'M BLOCKED FOR SOME REASON.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.214
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PSYCHIC

13:45.320 --> 13:47.049
TO KNOW SHE PROBABLY CAME
FROM ONE OF THESE HOUSES.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.082
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD'S A CESSPOOL.
COME ON, O'HARA.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.394
- WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.024
WHA--WAIT.

13:55.130 --> 13:57.428
SHE CAME FROM THE WOODS.
I'M SURE OF IT.

13:57.530 --> 14:01.034
- FINE, LET'S GO TO THE WOODS.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.608
- YOU KNOW, IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS,

14:03.710 --> 14:06.338
BUT IT'S STILL PRETTY EFFECTIVE.

14:07.910 --> 14:09.946
- THIS IS WHERE THE GIRL'S BODY
WAS FOUND.

14:09.980 --> 14:10.139
- SHE MUST HAVE BEEN FLEEING ONE
OF THESE SHACKS INTO THE WOODS.

14:12.680 --> 14:17.913
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS THE EAST
ST. LOUIS OF SANTA BARBARA.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.621
- ACTUALLY, UM,

14:23.730 --> 14:25.948
I'M SENSING THAT
SHE CAME FROM THE WOODS.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.925
- NICE WORK, SHAWN.
- THANKS, BABE.

14:27.960 --> 14:28.119
- YEAH.

14:28.960 --> 14:29.119
IT'S DEFINITELY THE DOG.

14:30.330 --> 14:31.558
[dog whimpers]

14:31.670 --> 14:34.332
IT'S DEFINITELY THE DOG
MAKING ME ITCH.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.465
[clears throat]

14:36.570 --> 14:40.404
- COME ON, SPENCER.
ANYTHING?

14:40.510 --> 14:42.102
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:42.210 --> 14:43.370
ARE YOU ONLINE SHOPPING?

14:44.580 --> 14:45.444
- I'M TRYING TO ORDER THOSE
SHOES THE GIRL WAS WEARING.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.171
- YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
LADIES' SHOES.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.941
- SHH.
THEY'RE UNISEX.

14:48.980 --> 14:49.139
LOOK, MAN, YOU HAVE BEEN
SNEAKER-BLOCKED FOR FIVE YEARS.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.659
AND I'M HELLING FOR KJELLINS.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.113
- THAT MAKES NO SENSE, SHAWN.

14:57.190 --> 14:58.122
- YOU CAN ONLY FIND THEM
ON THIS SWEDISH WEBSITE,

14:58.930 --> 15:00.522
BUT IT'S IN THIS
STRANGE LANGUAGE

15:00.630 --> 15:01.995
THAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.988
- IT'S SWEDISH, SHAWN.
SWEDISH.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.294
- HUH.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.958
BUT I THOUGHT SWEDISH
WAS JUST LIKE ENGLISH

15:07.070 --> 15:08.367
BUT WITH AN ACCENT.

15:08.470 --> 15:11.359
YOU KNOW, LIKE THE BRITISH
OR IRE-LISH?

15:12.610 --> 15:14.578
- BIFLOD.
BIFLOD.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.375
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.038

16:04.260 --> 16:06.148
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IS IT, LASSIE JR.?

16:06.260 --> 16:07.750
- MAYBE HE GOT A SCENT OFF
THE GIRL'S BODY.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.152
- I THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.591
NICE WORK, DOG.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.015
- NICE WORK, SPENCER.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.020
- WHO'S A GOOD DOGGIE?
WHO'S A GOOD PUPPY?

16:41.530 --> 16:43.623
- DRIVER'S LICENSE
SAYS HE'S CORY WOLFE.

16:43.730 --> 16:45.163
36 YEARS OLD.

16:45.270 --> 16:46.259
HAS THE SAME KNIFE WOUNDS
AS THE BODY

16:46.370 --> 16:47.632
WE FOUND THE OTHER DAY.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.093
- WELL, I'M GUESSING
WHOEVER KILLED

16:50.170 --> 16:52.309
PALMA AND WOLF ALSO ATTACKED
SPENCER'S JANE DOE.

16:52.410 --> 16:55.538
[cell phone chimes]

16:55.640 --> 16:57.779
- HELLO?

16:57.810 --> 16:58.174
THANK YOU.

17:02.420 --> 17:05.048
JANE DOE JUST WOKE UP.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.082
- SO YOU GOT THREE BODIES,

17:07.020 --> 17:07.554
AND THE ONLY THING
LINKING THEM TOGETHER

17:08.260 --> 17:09.079
IS THE NATURE OF THEIR INJURIES.

17:09.660 --> 17:10.684
I HATE WHEN IT'S VAGUE.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.126
DON'T YOU, BUDDY?
DON'T YOU HATE WHEN IT'S VAGUE?

17:14.230 --> 17:16.494
- SHAWN, YOU SENSING SOMETHING?
- I'M SEEING SOMETHING.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.669
I'M SORRY, GUS,
WERE YOU BITTEN

17:17.770 --> 17:19.226
BY A CHIMP BACK THERE?

17:19.330 --> 17:21.264
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE
A TOUCH OF RAGE GOING ON.

17:21.370 --> 17:22.735
- IT'S LASSIE'S DOG.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.762
HE'S KILLING ME.
- COME ON, SON.

17:24.870 --> 17:26.428
YOU KNOW YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
ALLERGIC TO DOGS.

17:26.540 --> 17:30.078
- YOU CAN DEVELOP ALLERGIES
LATER IN LIFE, SHAWN.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.272
MY COUSIN BECAME ALLERGIC

17:31.380 --> 17:33.348
TO ANIMAL FUR
LATE IN HIS 30$.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.213
IT WAS TRAGIC.
THOSE FERRETS WERE LIKE FAMILY.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.618
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT.

17:41.790 --> 17:44.827
- HEY, GUYS.
I GOT SOMETHING.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.488
THERE'S A NAME IN IT.

17:46.590 --> 17:48.091
"MASON PASTERNAK."

17:48.200 --> 17:50.088
- IT'S A KID'S JACKET.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.565
- WE MAY BE LOOKING AT
A FOURTH VICTIM.

17:51.670 --> 17:55.197
I LIKED IT BETTER
WHEN IT WAS VAGUE.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.609
- YOU THINK--I THINK JULES
IS STARTING TO THAW.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.701
YEAH, I MEAN, I-I KNOW
ONE THING ABOUT WOMEN,

17:59.810 --> 18:01.471
AND THAT'S THAT
THEY DON'T HOLD GRUDGES.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.104
I MEAN, THEY'RE VERY EASY-BREEZY
THIS WAY.

18:03.210 --> 18:05.849
- I THINK YOUR CONCUSSION
JUST GOT UPGRADED TO SEVERE.

18:05.950 --> 18:07.815
- HI, THERE.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.115
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

18:10.220 --> 18:13.257
I AM THE VERY HEROIC MAN THAT
BROUGHT YOU HERE LAST NIGHT.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.659
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

18:16.760 --> 18:18.523
IT'S OKAY.
THEY'RE--THEY'RE BOTH WITH ME.

18:18.630 --> 18:22.828
THE BLONDE AND I ARE ACTUALLY
VERY MUCH IN LOVE.

18:24.800 --> 18:28.566
I AM SENSING THAT YOU
ARE FROM SWEDEN.

18:28.670 --> 18:31.639
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

18:31.740 --> 18:33.799
- WE'RE WITH THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.775
WE WANT TO FIND
WHO DID THIS TO YOU.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.778
CAN YOU TELL US YOUR NAME?

18:36.880 --> 18:38.472

LAST NIGHT?

18:41.820 --> 18:42.172

18:43.590 --> 18:45.478
I THINK I SHOULD PROBABLY
DO THE TALKING,

18:45.590 --> 18:48.184
CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL RAPPORT.

18:48.290 --> 18:50.827
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
LAST NIGHT, ELIN?

18:50.930 --> 18:54.149
- MY BOYFRIEND AND I WERE
ATTACKED BY A MAN

18:54.260 --> 18:56.490
WITH BLACK MASK.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.795
- BOYFRIEND?

18:58.830 --> 18:59.194
I'M AFRAID THIS MAY BE
DIFFICULT,

19:00.300 --> 19:04.168
BUT CAN YOU IDENTIFY THIS MAN?

19:04.270 --> 19:08.331
- THAT'S CORY, MY BOYFRIEND.
IS HE...

19:08.440 --> 19:11.898
- I'M AFRAID SO.

19:12.010 --> 19:13.841
- INTERESTINGLY,
WE FOUND A BODY

19:13.950 --> 19:15.542
WITH SIMILAR INJURIES
THE OTHER DAY.

19:15.650 --> 19:17.311
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ATTACKED

19:17.420 --> 19:19.479
BY THE SAME PERSON, SO I WANTED
TO SHOW YOU ANOTHER PICTURE.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.558
- OH, NO!
NO, THAT'S ERIK.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.924
WE DATED ONCE,
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.179
IT'S ANDERS.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.188
IT'S ANDERS.
HE DID THIS.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.689
I KNOW IT'S HIM.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.394
- WHO'S ANDERS?
- HE WAS A BOYFRIEND IN SWEDEN.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.195
- WHOA, SOMEBODY IS
A VERY POPULAR GIRL.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.437
[chuckles]
AM I RIGHT?

19:33.540 --> 19:38.330
BECAUSE OF THE BOYFRIENDS?

19:38.440 --> 19:40.601
AND WHY SHOULDN'T YOU BE
POPULAR?

19:40.710 --> 19:43.747
YOU'RE YOUNG,
AND YOU'RE FERTILE.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.875
INTERNATIONAL...
YOU'RE OPEN-MINDED.

19:45.980 --> 19:47.447
I MEAN, YOU'VE PROBABLY
BEEN WITH GIRLS.

19:47.550 --> 19:49.575
- SHAWN.

19:50.750 --> 19:53.480
- I'M SORRY.
PLEASE CONTINUE.

19:53.590 --> 19:56.582
- WHEN I BROKE OFF WITH ANDERS,
HE TOOK IT BADLY.

19:56.690 --> 19:58.226
HE THREATENED ME,
MY FAMILY.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.854
HE'S WHY I LEFT SWEDEN.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.849
AND NOW HE'S FOUND ME.
HE'S FOUND ME.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.723
- IT'S OKAY. WHY DON'T
WE CHECK WITH IMMIGRATION?

20:04.830 --> 20:05.899
SEE IF THIS ANDERS HAS ENTERED
THE COUNTRY.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.433
IN THE MEANTIME,

20:07.540 --> 20:08.837
LET'S HAVE HER DESCRIBE HIM
TO A SKETCH ARTIST.

20:08.940 --> 20:11.431
I WANT YOU TO STAY WITH HER.

20:11.540 --> 20:14.976
- I'LL MISS YOU.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.832
WELL, HERE'S
THE GOOD NEWS, ELIN.

20:16.940 --> 20:18.805
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

20:18.850 --> 20:19.202
I'M JUST SO GLAD THAT I WAS ABLE
TO BE THERE FOR YOU.

20:22.980 --> 20:25.949
AND I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING
THAT YOU HAVE

20:26.050 --> 20:28.610
A RELATIVELY LARGE FOOT
FOR A WOMAN.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.359
DO YOU MIND IF I MAKE A LITTLE
SIZE COMPARISON?

20:31.460 --> 20:32.984
- SHAWN.
- [chuckles]

20:33.090 --> 20:35.251
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

20:35.360 --> 20:37.260
MUST HAVE BEEN
A FORCED PERSPECTIVE

20:37.370 --> 20:39.361
FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING.

20:39.470 --> 20:41.335

THE RIGHT ADDRESS?

20:41.440 --> 20:43.567

21:22.040 --> 21:23.644

21:23.750 --> 21:28.972
PUT YOUR COAT IN THE HAMPER.

I WARNED HER.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.864

26:57.040 --> 26:58.905
TELL US, SHAWN.

26:59.010 --> 27:01.945
- WELL, SPENCER MIGHT BE RIGHT.
THERE WAS AN ABORTED 911 CALL.

27:02.050 --> 27:04.939
[suspenseful music]

27:05.050 --> 27:06.915
*

27:07.020 --> 27:07.952
[gun clicks]

27:09.260 --> 27:11.182
[knock on door]

27:11.290 --> 27:12.621
SBPD!

27:12.730 --> 27:13.992
[door creaks]

27:29.240 --> 27:30.946
- TORSTEN?

27:31.050 --> 27:33.302
- THAT'S RIGHT, JONAS.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.411
[knock on door]

27:38.520 --> 27:40.818
- DAD. GREAT.
I NEED YOUR HELP WITH A CASE.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.411
- HEY, THERE'S MY FUTURE
SON-IN-LAW.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.226
- STEP-SON-IN-LAW, LLOYD.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.786
- EITHER WAY,
RIGHTS OF INHERITANCE

27:46.890 --> 27:48.994
ONLY APPLY TO BLOOD RELATIVES.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.989
THIS WILL GIVE THEM ONE LESS
THING TO FIGHT OVER.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.124
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

27:53.230 --> 27:54.959
- SHAWN, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HEAD?

27:55.070 --> 27:55.968
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

27:56.070 --> 27:58.129
- OH, UH--
[laughs]

27:58.240 --> 28:01.004
THINGS GOT A LITTLE CRAZY
AFTER YOU LEI-T LAST NIGHT.

28:01.110 --> 28:03.032
THE GAZPACHO FOUNTAIN
GOT TURNED OVER,

28:03.140 --> 28:04.801
AND THE CHICKEN DANCE
TURNED INTO

28:04.910 --> 28:07.845
MORE OF A CHICKEN SCRUM.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.445
SERIOUSLY, I'M FINE.
LLOYD, YOU'RE HERE.

28:11.550 --> 28:13.017
- YUP.
- IN THE HOUSE.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.951
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THAT
THE MEXICO TRIP

28:15.060 --> 28:16.857
SORT OF PUT THIS RELATIONSHIP
TO BED.

28:16.960 --> 28:17.949
- WELL,
INAUSPICIOUS BEGINNINGS

28:18.060 --> 28:19.789
Ol-TEN YIELD SURPRISING RESULTS.

28:19.890 --> 28:21.824
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOUR DAD
TODAY ON THAT BOAT.

28:21.930 --> 28:23.056
HE'S JUST RAKING
IN THE SEA BASS.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.024
- I WASN'T RAKING.

28:24.930 --> 28:25.362
- SEE? YOU'RE DOING
THAT THING AGAIN.

28:25.870 --> 28:26.791
YOU'RE SO MODEST.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.834
I'M TRYING TO GET HIM TO ACCEPT
HIS BRILLIANCE.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.692
ARE YOU EVEN AWARE
OF WHAT YOUR FATHER HAS

28:30.810 --> 28:32.368
JUST BUBBLING UP INSIDE?

28:32.470 --> 28:33.869
- UNFORTUNATELY, I AM, LLOYD.

28:33.980 --> 28:34.935
I'VE SHARED A BATHROOM
WITH HIM.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.177
AND I'VE SEEN HIS NAVEL.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.145
YOU THINK I CAN GET ONE OF
THOSE BEERS?

28:38.250 --> 28:40.707
- ABSOLUTELY.
FROSTED, UNFROSTED?

28:40.820 --> 28:43.209
- SURPRISE ME, YOU BIG BOOB.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.849
- SHAWN,
YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:48.960 --> 28:50.450
- YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.982
[claps]
- SO WHAT DO YOU GOT?

28:52.090 --> 28:53.990
- WELL, I GOT A SUSPECT.

28:54.100 --> 28:57.092
KILLED TWO GUYS THAT HIS EX
WAS DATING IN A JEALOUS RAGE.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.997
AND THEN I DISCOVERED
THAT HE ALSO KILLED

28:59.100 --> 29:00.988
HIS MALE ROOMMATE, RIGHT?

29:01.100 --> 29:02.397
I'M JUST--I'M LOOKING FOR
MOTIVE HERE.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.900
- WELL, ANY PERTINENT DETAILS?
- YEAH.

29:04.940 --> 29:05.099
A 911 CALL FROM THE ROOMMATE
MINUTES BEFORE HIS DEATH.

29:09.110 --> 29:11.908
- WELL, MY GUESS IS
THE ROOMMATE FOUND OUT,

29:12.010 --> 29:13.102
HE ATTEMPTED TO CALL THE COPS,

29:13.210 --> 29:14.939
AND THE EX-BOYFRIEND KILLED HIM.
- MM-HMM.

29:15.050 --> 29:16.369
BET THAT'S IT.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.947
- THAT'S IT.
- MM-HMM.

29:18.050 --> 29:19.415
- YOU CAME OVER HERE FOR THAT?

29:19.520 --> 29:21.112
SHAWN, YOU COULD'VE FIGURED THAT
OUT FOR YOURSELF.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.255
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE?

29:22.360 --> 29:25.989
- YEAH,
BUT I GOTTA WARN YOU.

29:26.090 --> 29:27.352
I'M ESPECIALLY FRAGILE
RIGHT NOW.

29:27.460 --> 29:29.951
I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO PUT ON
THE KID GLOVES.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.925
- HERE IT IS--THERE'S ONE.

29:32.030 --> 29:33.930
- [laughs]
THAT'S FUNNY.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.838
- BEER'S COMING SOON.
I'M WASHING A GLASS.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.009
[water running]

29:38.110 --> 29:41.170
- SO JULES FOUND OUT.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.929
AND NOW SHE THINKS THAT
OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP

29:43.040 --> 29:44.507
IS A BIG LIE.

29:44.610 --> 29:46.100
- YOU IDIOT!

29:46.210 --> 29:48.371
- WHAT?
- I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.913
- I THINK MAYBE YOU NEED TO LACE
THOSE GLOVES A LITTLE TIGHTER.

29:49.950 --> 29:50.109
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT I'M GOING TO BE

29:51.290 --> 29:52.245
IMPLICATED IN YOUR LITTLE
CHARADE?

29:52.350 --> 29:53.988
DID YOU EVER STOP AND THINK

29:54.090 --> 29:55.512
FOR ONE SECOND
HOW THIS MIGHT AFFECT ME?

29:55.620 --> 29:57.053
- YEAH, IT WAS
THE FIRST THOUGHT I HAD

29:57.160 --> 29:58.957
AI-TER SHE ENDED
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

29:59.060 --> 30:00.925
- AH, SORRY, GUYS.
LIME? NO LIME?

30:00.960 --> 30:01.119
- LLOYD, GIVE US A MINUTE HERE,
WOULD YOU?

30:05.630 --> 30:09.999
- WELL, ALL CHARADES ASIDE,

30:10.100 --> 30:12.261
JULIET IS OBVIOUSLY VERY HURT
BY ALL OF THIS,

30:12.370 --> 30:13.906
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

30:13.940 --> 30:14.099
- WELL, DID YOU CONSIDER
GOING COSTANZA?

30:16.280 --> 30:17.531
- IT WAS MY FIRST MOVE.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.198
- SHE'S GOTTA COOL OFF, SHAWN.

30:19.310 --> 30:20.572
NOBODY STAYS MAD FOREVER.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.170
WHO YOU CALLING?
- HOSPITAL.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.384
YEAH, THIS IS SHAWN SPENCER.

30:24.490 --> 30:28.278
AGAIN, HAS THE POLICE DETAIL
ARRIVED FOR ELIN'S ROOM?

30:28.390 --> 30:30.927
THAT'S 1502.

30:30.960 --> 30:31.119
I SEE. AND--AND...

30:33.060 --> 30:35.392
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

30:35.500 --> 30:38.469
UH-HUH.
THANK YOU.

30:38.570 --> 30:39.969
SHE WAS DISCHARGED
EIGHT HOURS AGO

30:40.070 --> 30:43.062
TO A WOMAN NAMED
MARY PASTERNAK?

30:43.170 --> 30:45.968
BORROWING YOUR TRUCK.

30:48.440 --> 30:49.475
[door closes]

30:50.580 --> 30:52.070
- WHY DO YOU HURT ME?

30:52.180 --> 30:54.011
- BUDDY.

30:55.150 --> 30:57.914
- IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL HERE.

30:58.020 --> 31:00.113
- YEAH, IT
PHOTOGRAPHS BEAUTIFULLY.

31:00.220 --> 31:02.984
WHY WOULD SOMEONE SHOOT AND STAB
THE FIRST VICTIM

31:03.090 --> 31:06.423
AND THEN JUST STAB
THE SECOND ONE?

31:06.530 --> 31:09.454
- YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE KIND OF PLACE

31:09.560 --> 31:13.326
A GIRL WOULDN'T HATE BEING
PROPOSED TO.

31:13.430 --> 31:15.591
- AH.

31:15.700 --> 31:17.964
WELL, ASIDE FROM
THE FOUL STENCH OF DEATH,

31:18.070 --> 31:19.606
I'D SAY IT'S JUST ABOUT
IDEAL.

31:19.710 --> 31:21.200
BUT DON'T WORRY, SWEETHEART.

31:21.310 --> 31:25.076
I WILL FIND US A SWEET SPOT
JUST LIKE THIS.

31:27.110 --> 31:29.874
- [gaSPSJ

31:37.720 --> 31:39.153
- ARE YOU MARY PASTERNAK?

31:39.260 --> 31:40.955
- LIKE I'D TELL YOU.

31:41.060 --> 31:42.493
- MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.
AND I NEED TO SEE ELIN.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.261
- OH, YOU'RE THE GUY
THAT FOUND HER.

31:44.370 --> 31:45.667
SHE'S RESTING IN
THE GUEST HOUSE.

31:45.770 --> 31:47.192
THEY SAID IT WAS OKAY
TO BRING HER HOME.

31:47.300 --> 31:49.291
- OKAY, WELL, I-I THINK
SHE'S IN SERIOUS DANGER.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.630
HER--HER EX-BOYFRIEND
IS IN TOWN,

31:51.740 --> 31:53.162
AND I THINK HE'S POTENTIALLY
PSYCHOTIC.

31:53.270 --> 31:54.601
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

31:54.710 --> 31:56.473
- BECAUSE I AM A PSYCHIC
WITH THE SBPD.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.070
- PSYCHIC?
[scoffs]

31:58.180 --> 32:00.171
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE MY KID
LEI-T HIS JACKET?

32:00.280 --> 32:01.440
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

32:01.550 --> 32:02.949
YOUR ACERBIC MANNER
MAY BE AMUSING

32:02.980 --> 32:03.139
UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES,

32:04.650 --> 32:07.949
BUT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

32:11.760 --> 32:15.252
IT'S ANDERS.
HE HAS HER.

32:22.470 --> 32:24.609
UH, ALL RIGHT,
I'M SENSING THAT ELIN

32:24.710 --> 32:27.031
WAS YOUR SON'S AU PAIR?

32:27.140 --> 32:29.005
- NO, SHE WAS HIS WIFE.
SOME PSYCHIC.

32:29.110 --> 32:31.704
- CAN YOU BE HELPFUL?
- HER PHONE!

32:31.810 --> 32:33.402
I GOT HER A CELL PHONE
SO I COULD KEEP TRACK

32:33.510 --> 32:35.046
OF HER WHEN SHE HAD MASON.

32:35.150 --> 32:36.412
I KEPT TABS ON MY HUSBAND
THAT WAY TOO.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.078
- THAT'S TRUE LOVE.
- HERE.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.612
TAKE MINE.
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND ELIN.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.085
AND DON'T BE TOO CAREFUL
WITH IT.

32:41.190 --> 32:42.259
I WANTED TO GET A NEW PHONE
ANYWAY.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.385
- SIRI, FIND ELIN.

32:44.490 --> 32:45.957
- YOU'RE SURE
THIS IS THE ADDRESS

32:46.060 --> 32:47.288
REGISTERED TO THAT GUN
YOU FOUND?

32:47.390 --> 32:48.596
- ABSOLUTELY.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.191
- LASSIE.
WHERE'S LASSIE JR.?

32:51.300 --> 32:53.097
- HE'S IN FOR THE OLD
SNIP-AND-FIX.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.394
HE'S A LASSITER NOW.

32:54.500 --> 32:57.060
HE'S GOTTA STAY FROSTY.
- [laughs]

32:57.170 --> 33:00.105
GUS, JULES AND I ARE THINKING
ABOUT MAKING IT OFFICIAL.

33:00.210 --> 33:02.007
[knock on door]
- SBPD!

33:02.110 --> 33:04.601
- YOU'RE MY BEST MAN, RIGHT?
- OKAY.

33:04.710 --> 33:10.068
- ASSUMING OF COURSE THAT THIS
WHOLE THING CLEARS UP.

33:10.180 --> 33:11.181
- THAT'S NOT GOING
TO BE NEARLY ENOUGH.

33:11.290 --> 33:14.282
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:14.390 --> 33:16.517
- IS YOUR NAME TORSTEN?
- YEAH.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.986
- CAN YOU AND YOUR STUPID HAIR
LET US IN?

33:21.800 --> 33:27.466
- YOU HAVE ARRIVED
AT YOUR DESTINATION.

33:27.570 --> 33:31.199
- OH, NO.
ELIN.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.164
- THREE MEN ARE DEAD.
ONE WAS KILLED WITH YOUR GUN.

33:33.270 --> 33:35.135
- MY GUN IS HERE
WHERE IT ALWAYS IS.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.708
I NEVER TAKE IT OUT.

33:37.810 --> 33:42.372
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
IT'S--

33:42.480 --> 33:44.789
ANDERS.
- EXCUSE ME?

33:44.890 --> 33:48.018
- I KNOW WHO TOOK THE GUN.

33:53.490 --> 33:59.326
- HUH.

33:59.430 --> 34:01.136
ANDERS.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.697
[knife slashing]

34:03.800 --> 34:06.530
[grunts]

34:09.880 --> 34:12.371
- ANDERS WAS A FRIEND
FROM UNIVERSITY,

34:12.480 --> 34:13.708
A PSYCHIATRIST.

34:13.810 --> 34:15.448
HE WAS TRACKING
AN UNSTABLE PATIENT.

34:15.550 --> 34:17.711
THE PATIENT HAD A SUPER ABUSIVE
STEPFATHER BACK IN SWEDEN.

34:17.820 --> 34:21.153
ONCE ATTACKED A MAN
THAT RESEMBLED HIM.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.716
[landing blow]

34:22.820 --> 34:24.822
[honks horn]

34:24.930 --> 34:26.818
[horn blares]

34:26.930 --> 34:29.353
[slowed heartbeat]

34:29.460 --> 34:32.258
[horn blares]
HO--

34:32.370 --> 34:37.160
DIOS MIOS!

34:39.170 --> 34:41.206
- WHAT WAS HIS STEPFATHER LIKE?

34:41.310 --> 34:42.800
- OH, HE WAS VERY FAMOUS AUTHOR

34:42.910 --> 34:45.845
BACK IN SWEDEN, BUT MAYBE NOT
TOO MUCH OF A FAMILY GUY.

34:45.950 --> 34:48.145
APPARENTLY, HE REALLY GAVE HER
A COMPLEX.

34:48.250 --> 34:50.844
- HER? THE PATIENT WAS FEMALE.

34:50.950 --> 34:52.611
- YEAH. YEAH.

35:01.160 --> 35:04.163
both: IT WAS ELIN.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.124
- [clears throat]

35:06.230 --> 35:08.698
[sound of tape rewinding]

35:12.770 --> 35:14.738
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

35:17.740 --> 35:18.809
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

35:18.910 --> 35:21.845
- THERE YOU ARE.
I'VE BEEN CALLING.

35:21.950 --> 35:24.282
- WHAT TIME IS IT?

35:24.390 --> 35:26.119
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THE DARK?

35:26.220 --> 35:27.482
- UH, JUST WONDERING WHAT THINGS
MIGHT'VE BEEN LIKE

35:27.590 --> 35:29.683
IF I HADN'T GIVEN JULES
MY STUPID JACKET.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.779
- WHAT?

35:32.890 --> 35:34.323
- NO.

35:34.430 --> 35:36.352
GUS, DON'T--DON'T EAT
THE BISCOTTI.

35:36.460 --> 35:38.792
- I DIDN'T.
I'M ALLERGIC, REMEMBER?

35:38.830 --> 35:39.194
- OH, RIGHT.
- LOOK.

35:41.770 --> 35:43.169
LASSIE FOLLOWED UP
ON YOUR HUNCH

35:43.270 --> 35:44.862
AND CALLED THE HOSPITAL
IN STOCKHOLM.

35:44.970 --> 35:46.608
TURNS OUT OUR GIRL ESCAPED.

35:46.710 --> 35:48.575
AND SHE HAS SERIOUSLY STEP-DADDY
ISSUES.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.843
WE NEED TO FIND HER, LIKE, NOW.

35:51.950 --> 35:55.909
DUDE, ARE YOU OKAY?

35:59.920 --> 36:01.217
- HOSPITAL IN STOCKHOLM
SENT OVER

36:01.320 --> 36:02.617
ELIN'S PSYCHOLOGICAL HISTORY.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.654
APPARENTLY, HER STEPFATHER DID
A REAL NUMBER ON HER.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.819
- YEAH.
THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

36:06.930 --> 36:08.591
ELIN WAS OUT THERE FINDING GUYS

36:08.700 --> 36:09.928
THAT FIT HER STEPFATHER'S
PROFILE

36:10.030 --> 36:11.895
AND TAKING THEM OUT.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.160
SHE KILLED ANDERS BECAUSE
HE WANTED

36:13.270 --> 36:14.259
TO TAKE HER BACK TO SWEDEN.

36:14.370 --> 36:15.530
AND SHE STOLE THE GUN

36:15.640 --> 36:16.868
THAT ANDERS TOOK FROM TORSTEN,

36:16.970 --> 36:18.403
USED IT ON THE FIRST VICTIM,
PALMA.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.865
LOST IT IN THE STRUGGLE.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.507
SECOND VICTIM, WOLF, ACTUALLY
GOT IN A FEW DECENT LICKS

36:23.610 --> 36:24.508
BEFORE HE DIED.

36:24.610 --> 36:25.747
AND THAT'S WHEN SHE RAN

36:25.850 --> 36:28.444
OUT OF THE WOODS
IN FRONT OF MY CAB.

36:28.550 --> 36:30.245
WHEN SHE GOT OUT OF
THE HOSPITAL, SHE PANICKED.

36:30.350 --> 36:32.648
TRIED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
SHE WAS ABDUCT ED.

36:32.750 --> 36:35.218
AND THEN SHE KILLED TORSTEN
IN CASE HE KNEW TOO MUCH

36:35.320 --> 36:37.379
AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF
MOVING ANDERS'S BODY

36:37.490 --> 36:38.821
WHEN I TRACKED HER DOWN.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.249
IS EVERYBODY CLEAR?

36:40.360 --> 36:42.328
I THINK I JUST BLEW
MY OWN MIND.

36:42.430 --> 36:45.729
- WELL, LET'S PUT AN APB OUT ON
MISS ELIN.

36:45.830 --> 36:46.899
I WANT ALL TRANSPORT HUBS
COVERED.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.536
- YEP.

36:51.610 --> 36:54.204
- AND HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

36:54.310 --> 36:55.868
- I HAVE A SLIGHT HEADACHE.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.436
- I WILL MAKE YOU SOME TEA.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.747
- [groans]

36:59.850 --> 37:02.318
- ELIN'S DAD LEI-T HER WHEN
SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.445
AND HER MOTHER MOVED
TO SANTA BARBARA

37:04.550 --> 37:06.518
AND DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT
THAT WAS RULED A SUICIDE?

37:06.620 --> 37:07.939
THIS IS SOME BLEAK STUFF.

37:08.050 --> 37:09.915
- WHERE DID THE MOTHER DIE?

37:10.020 --> 37:11.829
- ON THE 192 OFF
MISSION RIDGE ROAD.

37:11.930 --> 37:16.651
- THAT'S WHERE ELIN DUMPED
ANDERS.

37:22.470 --> 37:23.892
- ELIN?
WE'RE APPROACHING.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.504
IT'S OKAY.

37:27.610 --> 37:29.669
- WHEN MY MOTHER LEI-T SWEDEN
FOR AMERICA,

37:29.780 --> 37:31.668
SHE PROMISED SHE'D GET US
A PLACE

37:31.780 --> 37:33.304
AND SEND FOR ME.

37:33.410 --> 37:35.970
- YEAH.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.968
I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR MOTHER.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.809
- IF I HAD BEEN A BETTER GIRL,

37:39.920 --> 37:41.911
MY REAL DADDY WOULDN'T HAVE
GONE AWAY.

37:42.020 --> 37:43.885
AND MY MOM WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.

37:43.990 --> 37:45.878
WE'D ALL BE TOGETHER.

37:45.990 --> 37:48.254
- WE KNOW WHAT YOUR STEPFATHER
DID TO YOU.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.793
- IT WAS MY FAULT.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.788
- NO, NO, NO.
IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT.

37:51.830 --> 37:51.989
LOOK, I HELPED YOU BEFORE.
YOU REMEMBER?

37:54.540 --> 37:55.859
IF I HADN'T GIVEN JULES
MY JACKET,

37:55.970 --> 37:57.858
WE WOULD HAVE FOUND YOU
IN THE MORGUE.

37:57.970 --> 38:00.803
AND GUS'S EYES WOULD'VE
SWOLLEN UP LIKE GRAPEFRUITS.

38:00.840 --> 38:00.999
- [imitates explosion]

38:03.610 --> 38:05.339
- AT LEAST THAT'S HOW IT ALL
PLAYED OUT IN MY HEAD.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.669
I'M PRETTY SlEIFIE IT TRACKS.

38:08.780 --> 38:10.668
- LET US HELP YOU AGAIN,

38:10.780 --> 38:13.840
BECAUSE YOU NEED HELP, ELIN.

38:13.950 --> 38:15.952
AND MAYBE A CHEESEBURGER.

38:16.060 --> 38:19.587
- AND MAYBE A HOSPITAL
DEDICATED JUST TO YOU.

38:19.690 --> 38:21.851
- PROBABLY A PRISON HOSPITAL.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.825
- OR MAYBE AN ISLAND PRISON
HOSPITAL.

38:23.860 --> 38:24.019
- OOH.

38:25.630 --> 38:26.767
- YEAH.

38:26.870 --> 38:27.894
- YES.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.868
LARGE, COMPASSIONATE,
MATRONLY WOMEN.

38:31.970 --> 38:36.339
- OKAY.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.873
HELP ME.

38:37.980 --> 38:41.347
- WHAT.
MAN, THAT'S HOW WE DO IT.

38:41.450 --> 38:44.840
WHAT THE--
[screams]

38:44.950 --> 38:46.838
- [grunts]

38:46.950 --> 38:48.884
- MY BEAUTIFUL BRAIN!
- GUS!

38:48.990 --> 38:52.050
THIS IS SOME CRAZY MONKEY-LIKE
STRENGTH, GUS!

38:52.160 --> 38:55.948
GUS!
I'M GOING TO LOSE!

38:56.060 --> 38:56.890
- DROP IT, ELIN!
[gun clicks]

38:57.000 --> 39:00.822
NOW!

39:00.930 --> 39:06.459
- YOU HEARD HER!

39:06.570 --> 39:07.935
- AH...

39:08.040 --> 39:10.429
- COME ON, LOONEY TUNES.

39:10.540 --> 39:11.905
- [crying]
THIS IS CRAZY.

39:12.010 --> 39:14.979
I'M OUT OF HERE.

39:17.150 --> 39:19.482
- YOU OKAY?

39:19.590 --> 39:21.615
- YEAH, IT'S--IT'S VERY
DIFFICULT

39:21.720 --> 39:26.589
TO HURT SOLID STEEL.
- HMM.

39:26.690 --> 39:28.999
- YOU RESCUED ME.

39:29.100 --> 39:32.126
- I'M A COP, SHAWN.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.939
- SHAWN.

39:52.050 --> 39:54.883
DON'T SAY ANYTHING UNTIL
I'M FINISHED.

39:54.990 --> 39:59.689
IF I HADN'T FOUND THAT
PIECE OF PAPER,

39:59.790 --> 40:01.599
WE WOULD'VE GONE ON LIKE
WE'D ALWAYS BEEN.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.520
HAPPY.

40:03.630 --> 40:06.497
BUT AT SOME POINT,
I'D HAVE TO FIND OUT.

40:06.600 --> 40:07.999
DON'T DENY IT.

40:08.100 --> 40:09.658
AND PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT
I MISUNDERSTOOD

40:09.770 --> 40:12.762
BECAUSE THAT JUST MAKES IT
WORSE.

40:12.870 --> 40:13.962
I TRUSTED YOU.

40:14.070 --> 40:17.608
THE ONE THING I ALWAYS KNEW
IN MY HEART

40:17.710 --> 40:19.974
WAS THAT I COULD TRUST YOU.

40:20.080 --> 40:24.540
AND THEN I FOUND THAT STUPID
PIECE OF PAPER.

40:24.650 --> 40:28.882
BUT I UNDERSTAND

40:28.990 --> 40:30.878
WHY YOU HAD TO KEEP IT
A SECRET.

40:30.990 --> 40:33.026
WHAT CHOICE DID YOU HAVE?

40:33.130 --> 40:35.826
MAYBE YOU WERE PROTECTING ME.

40:35.930 --> 40:37.693
AND IF YOU'RE NOT PSYCHIC,

40:37.800 --> 40:42.828
THEN YOU ARE
A REALLY GOOD COP.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.864
LIKE, MAYBE ONE OF THE BEST.

40:45.970 --> 40:47.858
NEXT TO ME.

40:47.970 --> 40:51.599
- SWEETHEART, I'M SO SORRY.
I'M SO--

40:51.710 --> 40:53.905
I'M SO SORRY.

40:54.010 --> 40:57.548
BUT I HAVE NEVER LIED ABOUT

40:57.650 --> 41:00.813
THE WAY I FEEL FOR YOU,
NOT EVER.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.808
GUS ON THE OTHER HAND,
I LIE TO DAILY.

41:02.920 --> 41:05.024
- [laughs]
- AND FREELY.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.086
BECAUSE HE CAN'T HANDLE
THE TRUTH

41:07.190 --> 41:09.454
ABOUT ANYTHING REALLY.

41:09.560 --> 41:10.925
- I LOVE YOU.

41:11.030 --> 41:13.999
- YEAH, YOU DO.

41:14.100 --> 41:16.864
GOD.

41:16.970 --> 41:18.801
- SHAWN.

41:18.910 --> 41:22.471
SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:22.580 --> 41:24.844
SHAWN.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.043
SHAWN!

41:28.780 --> 41:31.248
- [clears throat]

41:31.350 --> 41:33.215
I MUST HAVE NODDED OFF.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.754
LOOK, BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,

41:35.860 --> 41:38.579
I AM HAVE BEEN OBSESSIVELY
REPLAYING

41:38.690 --> 41:41.750
LASSITER'S WEDDING IN MY HEAD.

41:41.860 --> 41:47.765
AND IF I JUST HADN'T GIVEN YOU
MY JACKET, RIGHT?

41:47.870 --> 41:50.737
EVERYTHING WOULD
STILL BE OKAY.

41:54.580 --> 41:55.899
SWEETHEART, I AM SO SORRY.

41:56.010 --> 41:57.773
- BUT YOU DID GIVE ME
YOUR JACKET.

41:57.880 --> 41:58.904
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S A BIG DEAL,

41:59.010 --> 41:59.977
BUT THEN THE MORE I THINK
ABOUT IT,

42:00.080 --> 42:03.277
THE ANGRIER I GET.

42:03.380 --> 42:07.043
I THINK--

42:07.150 --> 42:10.017
NO.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.259
I KNOW I NEED SOME SPACE.

42:17.100 --> 42:20.126
- SO WH--WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
EXACTLY?

42:20.230 --> 42:22.937
- I THINK YOU SHOULD MOVE OUT.
