00:51.718 --> 00:54.687
l have an urgent message for Dr Nordlinger.

00:54.754 --> 00:56.585
l can deliver it.

00:56.689 --> 01:01.217
- l was asked to confirm he received it and...
- That's not procedure.

01:01.327 --> 01:05.388
..report back
Dr Nordlinger's acknowledgment.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.665
What's going on?

01:11.738 --> 01:15.538
There's some confusion as to
the proper procedure, Dr Nordlinger.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.848
l have a communication for you.

01:39.265 --> 01:43.133
Communication acknowledged
and confirmed, Captain.

01:44.370 --> 01:47.066
We're returning to base.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.909
- Officer Banford.
- Captain?

02:06.392 --> 02:10.226
Prepare to transmit
to operations commander.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.890
Transmit what, sir?

02:21.074 --> 02:24.009
Sir, what is the communication?

02:24.110 --> 02:26.772
We're coming in.

04:52.759 --> 04:56.456
- l'm sorry l'm late.
- Have a seat, Agent Reyes.

05:04.337 --> 05:08.671
Agent Reyes, l thought
we might have a little chat.

05:11.911 --> 05:15.847
Mr Skinner here has been trying
to help me put together

05:15.948 --> 05:19.008
the pieces of your X-Files investigation.

05:19.118 --> 05:20.983
Can we cut the crap?

05:21.087 --> 05:23.954
Can we? There's a lot of crap to cut through.

05:24.023 --> 05:29.086
Agent Reyes, you probably want to zip it
and try to cooperate.

05:29.929 --> 05:33.660
Like it or not, l'm charged
with the task of reining you in.

05:33.766 --> 05:36.599
Reining us in? For what?

05:36.669 --> 05:41.766
Unauthorized autopsies, breaking
and entering into a state water facility,

05:41.841 --> 05:43.832
willful misuse of your positions.

05:43.943 --> 05:46.878
l don't wanna go into this without my partner.

05:46.979 --> 05:53.214
Your partner. Your so-called partner, who's
running this circus, is nowhere to be found.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.549
What are you doing, Brad?

05:55.655 --> 06:01.719
Giving you and Mr Skinner the chance to put
a nice spin on this mess that Doggett's made.

06:01.828 --> 06:04.956
Agent Reyes, if you're not gonna zip it,

06:05.031 --> 06:10.526
at least recognize that
he's the only one who can help you.

06:14.807 --> 06:19.369
We were given a tip we believe
leads to a larger conspiracy.

06:19.912 --> 06:23.678
Conspiracy? lnvolving the FBl?

06:23.750 --> 06:27.982
John Doggett and l are running
a legitimate investigation into the FBl.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.386
- Neither one of us feels...
- Agent Reyes.

06:31.657 --> 06:35.889
l'm trying to help you keep yourjob.

06:35.995 --> 06:41.900
But that's not gonna happen if you insist
on chasing shadows, chasing conspiracies.

06:42.001 --> 06:45.164
How do you know there isn't one?

06:45.238 --> 06:51.108
You're taking on the entire FBl here, Monica.

06:53.246 --> 07:01.847
This witch-hunt isn't going
to expose anything but you.

07:02.855 --> 07:07.554
That is, unless you distance yourself
from John Doggett.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.363
What are you doing?

07:19.439 --> 07:24.877
l'm distancing myself, Brad.
From you. From your political games.

07:24.944 --> 07:29.574
- You just wanna get John Doggett.
- You're making a big mistake here.

07:29.649 --> 07:33.415
Yeah. l seem to make one
every time l walk in your door.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.931
Lie back, John. lt's OK.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.736
What the hell's this?

07:56.809 --> 08:03.442
lt's Shannon, Shannon McMahon.
We were together in Bravo Company, USMC.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.178
You tried to contact me.

08:06.285 --> 08:09.413
What the hell are you doing here now?

08:13.459 --> 08:16.257
Your lungs were full of water.

08:18.664 --> 08:22.600
- Pulled me under.
- l did what l had to.

08:22.668 --> 08:26.297
- You held me down. l remember.
- They would have caught you.

08:26.372 --> 08:30.672
They might have figured it out,
what you've started to figure out.

08:32.211 --> 08:34.679
What are you?

08:34.780 --> 08:37.476
You know what l am.

08:38.885 --> 08:42.650
l'm the product of
50 years of military science,

08:42.722 --> 08:46.180
the program your old friend
Knowle Rohrer told you about.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.721
l'm a bioengineered combat unit.

08:52.832 --> 08:56.962
l have no weaknesses. l don't sleep.

08:57.036 --> 09:02.702
l can breathe underwater.
That's how l saved your life, John.

09:05.011 --> 09:08.469
How do you know what l know?
What Knowle Rohrer told me?

09:08.548 --> 09:13.042
Knowle Rohrer and l were drafted
right out of Bravo Company together.

09:13.152 --> 09:15.552
We were...

09:15.655 --> 09:17.885
Adam and Eve.

09:17.990 --> 09:22.086
The program's first.
There are many more now.

09:22.194 --> 09:24.059
Knowle Rohrer is dead.

09:24.764 --> 09:27.494
You can't kill us. We can't be killed.

09:29.201 --> 09:32.728
Knowle Rohrer and l
are alike in almost every way.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.534
The difference is, l hate what l am.

09:38.844 --> 09:41.711
Why are you here telling me this?

09:41.781 --> 09:47.014
The program's expanding
in ways no one ever dreamed of.

09:47.086 --> 09:50.351
l need your help to stop it, John.

09:50.423 --> 09:54.723
You need my help? What can l do?

09:54.794 --> 10:00.130
Expose the deaths of those two men l killed,
what they were doing.

10:00.232 --> 10:04.293
- What were they doing?
- Preparing the water supply.

10:05.571 --> 10:07.971
Preparing it for what?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.614
What are you doing, Captain?

10:22.722 --> 10:26.624
Where are you going?
We're under strict orders not to leave ship.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.626
Look at us.

10:28.728 --> 10:33.392
They've got us tied up
at a civilian dock in Baltimore. Why?

10:34.667 --> 10:36.897
l think they may be onto us.

10:36.969 --> 10:40.905
You're only drawing suspicion if they're not.
You can't leave.

10:40.973 --> 10:45.740
We can't risk waiting.
We can't risk not making contact now.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.473
l'll be back.

11:12.104 --> 11:14.334
Hi. Sorry about the hour.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.671
l just put him down.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.173
l couldn't talk on the phone.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.014
What is it?

11:29.121 --> 11:33.023
l was told to leave this alone.

11:34.827 --> 11:40.390
You and Mulder asked me to leave it be,
to let Mulder disappear.

11:40.499 --> 11:44.663
We were concerned for the safety of the baby,
and for Mulder.

11:45.705 --> 11:50.039
Why am l risking that now? Why are you?

11:50.743 --> 11:54.179
Why are you getting mixed up
with Doggett's investigation?

11:54.246 --> 11:56.874
Something happened...

11:57.917 --> 12:00.215
with my baby.

12:00.319 --> 12:01.980
What?

12:05.091 --> 12:07.059
l can't explain it.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.020
lt's, uh...

12:12.264 --> 12:15.358
lt's unexplainable.

12:15.434 --> 12:19.530
lt's, uh... lt's not normal.

12:19.605 --> 12:25.510
Whatever it is,
l think you've made a terrible mistake.

12:27.880 --> 12:32.579
Letting Doggett pull you into this.
l mean, he's hellbent.

12:32.685 --> 12:36.382
And Agent Reyes is following
right in his tracks.

12:36.455 --> 12:39.185
l need answers.

12:39.258 --> 12:44.958
l need to know.
l can'tjust sit around wondering.

12:46.899 --> 12:52.064
lf you can't tell me, then get to Mulder.
Tell him what happened.

12:52.138 --> 12:55.266
No. Mulder can't know.

12:57.576 --> 13:02.707
He can't be brought back into this.
He can't be brought back to the FBl.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.910
lt's just too dangerous for him right now.

13:12.424 --> 13:15.552
lt's too dangerous for everyone.

13:32.845 --> 13:38.511
The EPA employee you are trying to reach,
Carl Wormus, is not available.

13:38.617 --> 13:42.781
lf you want to leave a voice mail,
stay on the line.

14:08.948 --> 14:11.007
Something's wrong.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.713
Very wrong.

14:14.820 --> 14:15.844
Sir?

14:19.124 --> 14:23.151
What is this? Where's Banford?

14:23.229 --> 14:28.189
Chief Petty Officer Banford
has been relieved of his post, sir.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.860
l'm your new second in command.

15:05.838 --> 15:09.069
l'm sorry if l woke you. lt's Monica Reyes.

15:13.579 --> 15:17.948
There's something you need to be aware of,
something you need to hear.

15:18.050 --> 15:21.713
Something l'm not sure l believe.

15:21.787 --> 15:23.448
l'm listening.

15:23.555 --> 15:26.683
lt's not me you need to hear it from.

15:33.432 --> 15:37.596
We may have some answers for you,
about your baby.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.280
Dana, this is Shannon McMahon.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.970
Let's start with the water.

16:12.071 --> 16:16.269
You're a scientist,
you'll appreciate the science involved.

16:16.342 --> 16:20.779
A new additive is being put in
the water supply. lt's called chloramine.

16:20.846 --> 16:25.749
lt's not news. Or let me say, it's been
reported but no one's asking questions yet.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.683
What should they be asking?

16:27.786 --> 16:33.656
To deliver something to everyone's home in
America, what better way than through water?

16:33.759 --> 16:36.785
l've had my fair share of conspiracy theories.

16:36.862 --> 16:41.162
So cut the mystery crap
and get to the science.

16:41.266 --> 16:44.633
Chloramine is just a substitute for chlorine.

16:44.703 --> 16:48.036
You can drink it and it's harmless.

16:48.140 --> 16:52.668
Unless someone were to quietly go
and change its molecular makeup.

16:55.347 --> 16:59.181
Who? And how?

17:00.319 --> 17:03.686
l think you'd be more interested in why.

17:03.789 --> 17:06.053
All right, then. Why?

17:06.157 --> 17:10.185
To prime a population to breed
a generation of super-soldiers.

17:10.295 --> 17:13.560
By adding something to our water?

17:13.665 --> 17:20.002
Something which promotes the mutation
of offspring and fertilization and pregnancy.

17:20.071 --> 17:22.233
What you're saying is absurd.

17:22.340 --> 17:25.401
ls it? No more absurd than l am.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.703
l am a first-generation prototype.

17:29.381 --> 17:33.579
Now they're seven stages advanced
on the science which created me,

17:33.685 --> 17:39.817
to the point where now they have given birth
to a super-soldier from a mutated egg.

17:49.001 --> 17:52.937
How can we trust any of this?

17:53.739 --> 17:56.367
Or you?

17:56.442 --> 17:59.377
What you say you are?

18:02.681 --> 18:05.775
We all have a standard mutation.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.870
What are you looking at?

18:28.273 --> 18:30.901
Ship's logs.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.740
Those logs are classified.

18:36.248 --> 18:40.412
As second in command,
l'm supposed to know the ship, sir.

18:40.486 --> 18:43.046
ln case something should happen to you.

18:47.893 --> 18:53.456
What is the greater mission of this ship?
lf l may ask. Sir?

18:56.301 --> 18:58.292
l don't ask.

18:59.438 --> 19:01.565
We don't ask.

19:12.784 --> 19:15.514
What's going on?

19:32.504 --> 19:35.632
lt's Banford, sir. Officer Banford.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.328
lt doesn't make any sense.

20:04.403 --> 20:07.702
lt doesn't hold up to
any argument either, does it?

20:07.806 --> 20:10.832
She drowned that man from the EPA.
She's drowned two men.

20:10.909 --> 20:15.039
She says they're part of the program,
working to spike Maryland's water.

20:15.147 --> 20:18.878
So she killed them as a way of
contacting you? You believe that?

20:18.984 --> 20:22.181
You saw that thing on her neck.
You said you saw it before.

20:22.254 --> 20:27.920
l think we're on to something. lt's freaky,
it's mind-blowing, but you gotta admit that.

20:28.026 --> 20:33.157
l'm not doubting what she is,
only what she says she's doing.

20:36.034 --> 20:39.197
- What? What'd you find?
- Nothing.

20:39.271 --> 20:42.035
Nothing more than
a small deformity of the spine.

20:42.107 --> 20:47.340
Physically, she seems absolutely normal,
as normal as you or l.

20:50.849 --> 20:53.511
l don't believe this.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.878
What don't you believe, Agent Doggett?

20:58.957 --> 21:02.017
l just examined her.

21:02.094 --> 21:06.258
That l'm here with both of you telling me
that you don't see what's in front of us.

21:06.365 --> 21:09.801
She's the key to everything in this case,
right to the FBl.

21:09.901 --> 21:12.131
For your sake, l hope so.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.972
But l hope not for mine.

21:25.250 --> 21:30.244
Agent Doggett, l don't wanna be making
this call, l really don't, but l'm forced to.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.790
What are you talking about?

21:33.625 --> 21:37.083
You wanna turf me now?
You gonna take my badge and gun?

21:37.162 --> 21:39.756
Agent Doggett, you just can't burst in here.

21:39.831 --> 21:45.428
How's it gonna look, you suspending me
right before l nail you as a co-conspirator?

21:45.504 --> 21:51.067
Glad you dropped in, Mr Doggett.
Assistant Director Follmer.

21:53.412 --> 21:54.674
You're Brad Follmer.

21:54.780 --> 21:58.841
l was just explaining
why you are being suspended,

21:58.950 --> 22:03.683
but l think your actions here
speak for themselves.

22:07.192 --> 22:11.993
l see what this is.
This is just a little bureaucratic pimp job.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.190
l'd watch your mouth, John.

22:14.299 --> 22:16.199
What this is,

22:16.301 --> 22:22.103
is a testament to your gross insubordination
and reckless disregard for the FBl.

22:23.041 --> 22:28.104
The orders start here and then
they come out your wishy-washy mouth?

22:31.817 --> 22:34.718
Paranoia must go with the job.

22:34.820 --> 22:39.223
You're starting to sound
just like Fox Mulder, Mr Doggett.

22:39.324 --> 22:42.350
Don't you ''Mr Doggett'' me.

22:42.461 --> 22:45.726
l don't answer to you. l answer to AD Skinner.

22:48.467 --> 22:52.301
The job suspension stands, Mr Doggett.

22:54.072 --> 22:56.506
Try and stop me.

23:21.666 --> 23:24.931
You never know
who'll come a-knocking, do you?

23:25.036 --> 23:28.938
- How'd you get in?
- Through the front door. How'd you get in?

23:29.040 --> 23:31.167
Through a security checkpoint.

23:32.177 --> 23:33.735
Kids' stuff.

23:35.547 --> 23:39.540
- What are you doing here?
- You sent us hacking on this investigation,

23:39.618 --> 23:42.109
only we had a small funding fiasco.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.245
They cut our lnternet service.

23:44.356 --> 23:47.757
Don't tell me you breached FBl security
just to log on.

23:47.859 --> 23:50.419
l think you wanna see this.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.929
Not this.

24:02.641 --> 24:05.576
OK, this is what we meant to show you.

24:05.644 --> 24:08.772
We are live in the EPA phone system.

24:08.880 --> 24:15.285
The numbers in red are calls to Deputy
Administrator Carl Wormus after he drowned.

24:16.221 --> 24:19.918
Who'd call him after it's
front-page news that he's dead?

24:19.991 --> 24:22.459
Someone who doesn't know it.

24:24.563 --> 24:29.591
Whoever it is, they're calling again
as we speak. Hook up a patch cord.

24:29.668 --> 24:31.295
Hurry.

24:36.408 --> 24:39.070
- Pick up the phone.
- What?

24:42.581 --> 24:44.640
Carl Wormus.

24:45.484 --> 24:49.477
l've been trying to reach you.
They've ordered us to port.

24:50.789 --> 24:54.850
One of my men is dead.
l think they suspect what we're up to.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.952
Right.

24:58.029 --> 25:01.658
What's it you need from us - me - on this end?

25:03.001 --> 25:06.767
Just like we talked about.
You're going to call the FBl.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.308
Right.

25:11.376 --> 25:16.678
l've gotta get to the FBl, tell them
about the lab they've got on board,

25:16.781 --> 25:19.181
about the horrors and the inhumanity.

25:19.284 --> 25:22.378
Expose these people for what they are.

25:35.467 --> 25:39.198
- l need to talk to you.
- l have an appointment.

25:39.671 --> 25:43.163
Don't do this to me, Brad.

25:47.913 --> 25:50.404
Give me two minutes.

25:53.919 --> 25:58.083
Here you are again, Monica,
walking through my door.

25:58.189 --> 26:01.989
- l need your help.
- l tried to help you.

26:03.161 --> 26:05.755
l'm asking you again.

26:07.432 --> 26:09.696
l'm listening.

26:09.768 --> 26:14.034
There's a woman at the
Department of Justice, Shannon McMahon.

26:14.105 --> 26:16.073
l need her case files.

26:16.174 --> 26:19.575
You say that like
it's something l can do. lt's not.

26:20.779 --> 26:22.713
lt's important to me.

26:22.781 --> 26:25.875
lmportant to Agent Doggett, in other words.

26:25.951 --> 26:29.079
You're on the wrong side of this fight.
l can show you.

26:29.187 --> 26:33.419
Trust me, l had it illustrated
by Mr Doggett himself today.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.460
Would you listen to me?

26:37.062 --> 26:42.728
People's lives are in danger here.
He's being set up. We're being set up.

26:42.801 --> 26:45.065
By who? The Justice Department?

26:45.136 --> 26:47.604
lt's why l need those files.

26:52.611 --> 26:59.244
l'd ask you to just do this for me.
But he's a good man.

27:00.251 --> 27:03.084
He believes he's in the right.

27:03.955 --> 27:08.483
And you? You always are?

27:20.739 --> 27:24.231
- Where's Shannon McMahon?
- Back at my house. Why?

27:24.309 --> 27:27.904
She's lying to you. She's not who you think.

27:27.979 --> 27:30.447
- Where'd you get this?
- Everywhere.

27:30.515 --> 27:35.782
She works for the Department of Justice.
Did you know that? l got her case files.

27:35.854 --> 27:40.655
Those men she killed? They'd contacted her
at DOJ, as whistle-blowers.

27:40.759 --> 27:43.751
She said they were part of the program.

27:43.828 --> 27:47.696
They were killed because
they wanted to expose the program.

27:47.799 --> 27:49.596
Why come to me?

27:49.668 --> 27:53.661
There's one man she can't pinpoint.
She wants you to lead her to him.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.797
Who are you talking about?

27:55.874 --> 27:59.037
He's captain of a navy ship
that spends all year at sea.

27:59.144 --> 28:03.046
He'd been in contact with both dead men
about a secret lab on that ship.

28:03.148 --> 28:06.049
Shannon McMahon's
the only sure thing we have.

28:06.151 --> 28:09.348
We go to this ship,
we risk coming out with both hands empty.

28:09.454 --> 28:12.116
lf this is true about this ship and this lab,

28:12.190 --> 28:17.321
there may be answers there
that l can't risk not knowing.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.854
Dr Nordlinger, a message for you, sir.

29:08.847 --> 29:15.753
l want every hard drive, all the data you've
got in this butcher shop you're running here.

29:40.378 --> 29:42.710
Where's this captain supposed to be?

29:42.781 --> 29:47.241
We're supposed to meet him at
a phone booth at 1am. lt's ten to.

29:47.318 --> 29:49.809
Somebody's already there.

29:51.156 --> 29:53.488
ls he calling or meeting you?

29:53.591 --> 29:56.754
l don't know. lt wasn't clear.

29:56.828 --> 29:59.228
He sees us.

30:00.665 --> 30:03.657
Hold up there.

30:08.573 --> 30:11.133
l said, hold up there.

30:16.181 --> 30:18.274
This ain't no captain.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.612
Who is it?

30:22.754 --> 30:25.154
Knowle Rohrer. Run.

30:26.424 --> 30:27.686
Now.

30:29.761 --> 30:31.319
Freeze! FBl!

31:23.581 --> 31:25.845
You didn't trust me.

32:42.727 --> 32:45.389
- You see anybody?
- Nobody.

32:49.567 --> 32:51.899
This can't be right.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.564
What happened to the captain?

33:24.969 --> 33:28.200
l think we found the captain.

34:10.514 --> 34:13.210
They're scuttling the ship.

34:27.764 --> 34:30.199
This must be it.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.422
ln here.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.588
- We gotta go.
- You see what this is?

34:57.695 --> 35:01.756
Agent Scully, we gotta go.
The ship's gonna blow.

35:01.866 --> 35:05.859
They're manipulating ova -
female eggs for transplantation.

35:11.075 --> 35:13.270
Look at these names.

35:13.377 --> 35:16.938
These are test subjects.

35:17.048 --> 35:19.448
Grab her. We got less than a minute.

35:19.550 --> 35:22.246
- Give me a second.
- We got no time.

35:22.320 --> 35:26.723
No, let go. Let me do this.
l have to see if l'm here.

35:28.559 --> 35:31.119
My name. My baby's name.

35:34.932 --> 35:39.232
You wanna see your baby again?
We got no time, Dana.

35:41.172 --> 35:43.800
We'll find another way.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.424
Deputy Director.

36:39.197 --> 36:42.724
My sources tell me
you wrapped up your investigation.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.858
l have my report ready, sir, yes.

36:51.075 --> 36:52.906
How do l come out?

37:06.924 --> 37:09.688
''Super-soldiers, a navy ship,

37:09.760 --> 37:15.699
and a woman at the Department of Justice
who drowned two men, all disappeared now,

37:15.766 --> 37:22.228
but which constitute a conspiracy
like a cancer in the US government.''

37:28.212 --> 37:31.113
Not a mention of my name, John.

37:31.215 --> 37:35.174
No, sir. l found nothing on you.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.916
Nothing damning
l could include in my report.

37:40.458 --> 37:43.427
And cos l got nothing to lose,

37:43.527 --> 37:48.726
let me say that l know your hands
are dirty on this thing, sir. Filthy.

37:48.799 --> 37:54.032
That's why you're here -
take a last wild punch before the bell.

37:55.473 --> 37:59.807
One thing l can't figure,
and then l'll be on my way,

38:00.878 --> 38:03.779
is why you put that obituary under my door.

38:03.881 --> 38:07.044
You think l did that?

38:07.118 --> 38:12.420
Over and over in my mind. lt had to be you.
You're the only one that had a reason.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.253
What's my reason?

38:14.325 --> 38:18.989
You tell me. You looking
just to get me fired or get me killed?

38:25.903 --> 38:29.805
- You ever hear of King George lll?
- You answer my question.

38:30.908 --> 38:36.005
He was King of England when
America declared independence in 1776.

38:36.113 --> 38:38.308
King George lll kept a diary.

38:38.416 --> 38:42.978
On July 4, 1776, he made an entry in it.

38:45.323 --> 38:48.690
''Nothing important happened today.''

38:49.994 --> 38:53.623
What the hell does that got to do with me?

38:53.698 --> 38:56.166
Revolutions start,

38:56.267 --> 38:59.202
things that change the world forever,

38:59.303 --> 39:03.535
and even kings can miss them
if they're not paying attention.

39:07.278 --> 39:12.011
Are you saying you left
that obituary to help me?

39:12.116 --> 39:15.608
To help me find the things that l found?

39:18.522 --> 39:20.956
Why would l believe that you'd help me?

39:21.025 --> 39:23.050
Agent Mulder believed me.

39:25.963 --> 39:29.330
What the hell are you talking about?
Mulder's long gone.

39:29.400 --> 39:33.803
Say l told Mulder that
he would be killed if he stayed.

39:33.871 --> 39:40.003
Same people who threatened me
if l didn't go along. Would you believe that?

39:40.077 --> 39:43.012
Mulder wouldn't hear it, not from you.

39:43.080 --> 39:46.208
l said l told him to go.

39:46.317 --> 39:49.081
l didn't say l persuaded him.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.983
Holy God.

39:56.026 --> 39:57.584
lt was Scully.

40:00.865 --> 40:04.232
Scully made him go. That's it, isn't it?

40:30.594 --> 40:33.085
You want the basement?

40:36.634 --> 40:40.764
Heard you got a stay of execution.
Congratulations.

40:41.639 --> 40:43.766
l'm sure you don't mean that.

40:43.874 --> 40:49.073
No. l'm sure the deputy director
has you just where he wants you.

40:50.548 --> 40:55.212
Don't get me wrong.
l'm a friend to the X-Files.

40:56.921 --> 41:00.823
lt's kind of a comfort,
having you down there,

41:00.925 --> 41:02.790
Mr Doggett.

41:12.903 --> 41:16.304
Just so long as you know where to reach us,

41:16.407 --> 41:18.841
Mr Follmer.

42:09.793 --> 42:12.023
Everything's gonna be OK.

42:12.730 --> 42:15.893
Go back to sleep.
