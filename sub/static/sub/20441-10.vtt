onto the Hooli-Con app?

00:07.269 --> 00:08.894
I mean, that's malware, Richard.

00:08.894 --> 00:11.477
Think of it more as forced
adoption through aggressive

00:11.477 --> 00:12.477
guerilla marketing.

00:12.894 --> 00:14.978
As a product of forced adoption,
I can assure you

00:14.978 --> 00:16.560
there are consequences.

00:21.978 --> 00:24.186

00:42.186 --> 00:43.144

00:44.103 --> 00:45.769
RICHARD HENDRICKS:
We have moved all....
of Melcher's data

00:45.769 --> 00:47.560

of mobile devices.

Oh! You only make that face
when your dick is on fire.

01:10.852 --> 01:12.394
So, you're certain?

01:12.394 --> 01:13.477
Definitively.

01:13.477 --> 01:16.519
The 36 HooliPhones
that blew up at Hoolicon

01:16.519 --> 01:19.144
and the 17 that blew up
around the US

01:19.144 --> 01:20.602
all had our code on them.

01:20.602 --> 01:23.310
Richard, these are
real people

01:23.310 --> 01:25.978
with real crotches,
and they're burning.

01:25.978 --> 01:28.686
We have to tell someone.
This was our fault.

01:28.686 --> 01:32.811
No. No, no.
Keenan's demo was built
to run on a $10,000 rig.

01:32.811 --> 01:35.686
Jack ported it
to a phone in four days.

01:35.686 --> 01:37.477
They wrote sloppy code
that's pinging

01:37.477 --> 01:39.477
the antenna constantly,
looking for the goggles.

01:39.477 --> 01:43.394
That had to have
caused the phone's antenna
to draw too much power...

01:43.394 --> 01:45.852
Which would overheat
the subpar battery.

01:45.852 --> 01:47.811
And when
we pinged our network
on top of all that...

01:47.811 --> 01:52.352
Dick fire.
Richard, what happened to being
Honest Abe from now on?

01:52.352 --> 01:54.602
We committed
a crime here.

01:54.602 --> 01:57.144
Barely, Jared.
The fact that
we hacked those phones

01:57.144 --> 01:59.352
works in our favor.
All of our code is hidden.

01:59.352 --> 02:03.477
Agreed. And when Hooli
launches a new software
update to fix the phones,

02:03.477 --> 02:06.477
our network
will still be functional,
Melcher will be happy,

02:06.477 --> 02:09.644
Monica will fund us,
and no one will ever know
what we did.

02:09.644 --> 02:12.936
I'll know!
Yes! I'll know too,
but I'm okay with it.

02:12.936 --> 02:14.310
I'm sorry.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.061
(rustling)

02:22.019 --> 02:23.144
What the fuck is this?

02:23.144 --> 02:25.394
I write three letters
every time I start a job...

02:26.560 --> 02:28.144
a personal action plan,

02:28.144 --> 02:30.144
a letter
to my 40-year-old self,

02:30.144 --> 02:32.560
and that,
a resignation letter.

02:32.560 --> 02:36.644
Uh, I'll be moving my things
back into my condo.

02:36.644 --> 02:39.352
What about your squatter?
Oh, he's been out for months.

02:39.352 --> 02:43.186
He left to go
sell cocaine at the Keystone
Pipeline protests.

02:43.186 --> 02:45.769
I've just been
staying in the garage
out of solidarity.

02:45.769 --> 02:47.144
You can't leave.

02:47.144 --> 02:49.228
Don't beg, Richard.
I'm not.

02:49.228 --> 02:51.894
According
to the employee handbook,

02:51.894 --> 02:55.352
which you wrote,
an employee cannot leave

02:55.352 --> 02:57.560
without giving
two weeks' notice.

02:58.936 --> 03:00.727
You-- you read
the handbook?

03:00.727 --> 03:04.560
Yeah, I did.
All right, fine.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.435
I'll fulfill my duties
under protest,

03:06.435 --> 03:08.936
but I will not do
anything illegal

03:08.936 --> 03:11.519
nor unethical,
and I will not lie.

03:11.519 --> 03:15.228
I already have upwards
of 50 burnt perinea
on my conscience.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.560
Richard, that's enough.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.936
Consider that
my two weeks' notice.

03:23.894 --> 03:26.894
(door opens)
All right.
Keep an eye on HooliNews,

03:26.894 --> 03:30.352
and let me know
when Jack announces
the HooliPhone update.

03:30.352 --> 03:33.978
What do you mean
you're not issuing
a software update?

03:33.978 --> 03:37.644
Who can say
why the phone Gavin Belson
brought to market

03:37.644 --> 03:43.103
started exploding
when we put Keenan Feldspar's
technology on it? Huh?

03:43.103 --> 03:46.602
Is it Gavin's fault?
Is it Keenan's fault?
Is it 50-50? Who knows?

03:46.602 --> 03:48.769
We need to change
the narrative here.

03:48.769 --> 03:51.686
Has anyone flown
commercial recently?

03:53.644 --> 03:57.186
Nor have I,
but apparently they're still
making the announcements

03:57.186 --> 04:00.978
at the gate
about Samsung Galaxy
Note 7 being banned.

04:00.978 --> 04:04.435
We can't have people
believing that our phones
blow up airplanes,

04:04.435 --> 04:08.228
no matter how much
Gavin and/or Keenan
may have wanted it.

04:08.228 --> 04:10.310
It's lethal PR.

04:10.310 --> 04:12.394
We need to get ahead
of this one,

04:12.394 --> 04:14.394
which is why I am
going to pull

04:14.394 --> 04:18.060
every last
affected HooliPhone
out of circulation

04:18.060 --> 04:20.310
and replace it
in the next three days.

04:20.310 --> 04:23.019
That's over
nine million devices.

04:23.019 --> 04:26.686
Gavin Belson had
to move heaven and earth
to get our China plants

04:26.686 --> 04:29.019
up to a capacity
of two million per day,

04:29.019 --> 04:32.435
and his negotiations with labor
were extremely delicate.

04:32.435 --> 04:35.852
Well, China has
never negotiated
with Jack Barker.

04:35.852 --> 04:38.894
What you're proposing
is staggeringly expensive

04:38.894 --> 04:41.061
and borderline impossible.

04:41.061 --> 04:42.186
We won't approve it.

04:44.394 --> 04:47.103
I see. Uh...

04:47.103 --> 04:50.352
Slight hitch.
I may have instructed
my comms team

04:50.352 --> 04:53.769
to issue a press release
announcing the recall...

04:53.769 --> 04:55.644
and it should
be going out at...

04:57.352 --> 04:59.186
Yeah, it's out.
Jack.

04:59.186 --> 05:02.686
I'll tell you what:
Let's just gas up
that HooliJet,

05:02.686 --> 05:07.103
and I am going to go ahead
and go to China!

05:07.103 --> 05:09.186
(theme music playing)

05:19.061 --> 05:24.019
So, every fucking HooliPhone
that we're on is being pulled
out of service and replaced

05:24.019 --> 05:25.894
with a new one
that doesn't have
our code on it.

05:25.894 --> 05:27.978
Half of our storage
capacity just gone.

05:27.978 --> 05:31.019
Where the fuck
are we gonna put
all of Melcher's data?

05:31.019 --> 05:35.269
Wait. We have a server farm
in the garage, right?

05:35.269 --> 05:38.894
Now, don't you think
if Anton could've saved our ass,
I would've suggested it by now?

05:38.894 --> 05:41.144
Why can't it work?
What are you,
fucking stupid?

05:41.144 --> 05:42.852
In order to hold
that much data,

05:42.852 --> 05:45.435
we would have to go
RAID zero, no backup,

05:45.435 --> 05:47.228
so if we lose
even one platter,

05:47.228 --> 05:49.394
we lose Melcher's data...
permanently.

05:49.394 --> 05:51.394
Plus, in Anton's
present condition,

05:51.394 --> 05:52.852
I'm afraid he might
totally melt down.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.686
We have to call Melcher.
No, we are
not calling Melcher.

05:55.686 --> 05:58.435
If we tell him
about any of this,
that would be suicide.

05:58.435 --> 06:00.269
Look, if we're gonna die,
let's just die.

06:00.269 --> 06:01.686
Why do we have
to take Anton with us?

06:01.686 --> 06:04.310
Jesus, man.
You know that thing's
not alive, right?

06:04.310 --> 06:06.435
Fuck your dumb machine.
Wait. Do you?

06:06.435 --> 06:08.061
Do you actually fuck
your dumb machine?

06:08.061 --> 06:09.769
Is that the secret
on your phone?
Fuck you.

Fuck you!
Do you raw-dog it?
Guys. Guys. Guys!

06:11.477 --> 06:13.978
Or do you put a condom
on your tiny penis and fuck it
in safe mode?

06:13.978 --> 06:16.228
Just fuck each other
and get it over with.
"Oh, Anton, fuck me!"

I'm sorry that you had
to witness that scene
in there.

07:04.269 --> 07:08.019
It probably gave you
the impression that the company
is in disarray,

07:08.019 --> 07:11.978
but I can assure you,
there's a very simple
explanation for that.

07:11.978 --> 07:14.519
It-- it is.
Sorry?

07:14.519 --> 07:18.394
