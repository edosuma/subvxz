01:27.901 --> 01:30.633
Oh, man. A fella
could get used to this.

01:31.501 --> 01:36.401
Ah, I'll bet the peanut inside
is all warm and toasty.

01:37.968 --> 01:41.266
Oh, Lord...

01:41.300 --> 01:44.500
bless this M&M...

01:44.534 --> 01:45.934
and the mighty cockroach

01:45.968 --> 01:48.533
I slain in battle to get it.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.301
Hi, honey.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.667
<i>You ruined my day,
you know.</i>

01:56.701 --> 01:58.133
Well, Peg, it's your own fault.

01:58.167 --> 02:00.734
Stop asking me
if you look old in the morning.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.200
Not that.

02:03.234 --> 02:05.400
Thanks to you, I had
a humiliating experience

02:05.434 --> 02:06.667
at the beauty
parlor.

02:06.701 --> 02:09.166
Your paycheck
fell out of my purse,

02:09.199 --> 02:11.267
and everyone saw it.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.266
I tried to pretend
it was Bud's,

02:14.300 --> 02:16.133
but no one
believed me.

02:16.167 --> 02:18.333
There it was,
just as plain as day:

02:18.367 --> 02:20.867
Al Bundy, 80 pesos.

02:21.634 --> 02:23.600
So I pretended
to laugh

02:23.634 --> 02:24.867
like I thought
it was funny,

02:24.901 --> 02:28.533
but inside,
I was dying.

02:31.567 --> 02:32.999
Mmm!

02:33.033 --> 02:35.567
The peanut's
all warm and toasty.

02:44.601 --> 02:45.934
Whoo!

02:45.968 --> 02:47.600
Oh, baby.

02:48.901 --> 02:50.233
What brought that on?

02:50.267 --> 02:52.468
Well, I was trying
to get my dinner back!

02:53.067 --> 02:55.166
Al, you're avoiding
the issue.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.800
Now, let's face it.
You're past 40.

02:57.834 --> 02:59.467
It's time you started
bringing home

02:59.501 --> 03:01.334
more money than Opie.

03:02.567 --> 03:05.767
Peg, Opie came home
to Aunt Bea's pies.

03:05.801 --> 03:09.533
Me, I come home
to Aunt Bea.

03:10.601 --> 03:12.366
Mom, Dad,

03:12.400 --> 03:14.333
I've got some
great news.

03:14.367 --> 03:16.667
What, they're starting
an all-you-can-eat buffet

03:16.701 --> 03:18.900
at the men's shelter?

03:18.934 --> 03:21.033
Good talking
to you, Dad.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.500
Mom, I've got
some great news.

03:23.534 --> 03:26.300
I've been selected one of five
Chicago-area students

03:26.334 --> 03:28.867
to go to the White House
and meet the president.

03:28.901 --> 03:30.467
Peg, did you
hear that?

03:30.501 --> 03:32.667
My boy's going to
meet the president.

03:32.701 --> 03:34.066
Son, do me a favor.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.999
I- if you meet
the white-haired old lady--

03:36.033 --> 03:37.700
You know, Mrs. President...

03:37.734 --> 03:40.433
She seems nice. Tell her
to go into the kitchen

03:40.467 --> 03:42.867
and fix something up,
and bring it home to old Dad.

03:42.901 --> 03:44.533
And, uh, while you're
at it, uh,

03:44.567 --> 03:47.900
bring me back some of that
presidential toilet paper.

03:47.934 --> 03:52.001
<i>Man, I'll bet
that stuff is smooth.</i>

03:53.200 --> 03:54.633
Yeah, sure, Dad.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.667
Mom, you want me to
grab a lamp or anything,

03:56.701 --> 03:58.033
if I have
a hand free?

03:58.067 --> 04:01.133
Well, I wouldn't
spit at a painting.

04:01.167 --> 04:04.400
Oh. Just Dad's
laundry, eh, Mom?

04:04.434 --> 04:07.233
Anyway, all I need
for the trip is 100 bucks.

04:07.267 --> 04:08.934
Hundred bucks?!

04:08.968 --> 04:12.500
For 100 bucks, we can get
the president to come here.

04:12.534 --> 04:15.033
Ah, what the hell.
Peg, uh, give me my checkbook.

04:15.067 --> 04:18.399
You want the personal
or the corporate account?

04:18.434 --> 04:21.033
I- I want the joint account.

04:21.067 --> 04:22.400
The one where
the checks say,

04:22.434 --> 04:23.400
"Mrs. Peggy Bundy and

04:23.434 --> 04:26.700
the nameless shoe salesman."

04:26.734 --> 04:28.467
Look, that was supposed
to be a joke.

04:28.501 --> 04:30.300
I had no idea
that they would actually

04:30.334 --> 04:32.101
put that on the checks.

04:35.067 --> 04:38.401
But at least they left out
the "witless" part.

04:40.467 --> 04:45.001
"Nameless
shoe salesman."

04:46.200 --> 04:47.300
Here you go, son.

04:47.334 --> 04:51.301
Now, this is
the Bundys' last $100.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.867
You're proud of me,
aren't you, Dad?

04:53.901 --> 04:56.767
I'm proud
of both my children.

04:56.801 --> 04:59.134
You guys,
I have great news!

05:02.901 --> 05:05.267
Was this couch
always here?

05:07.901 --> 05:09.533
Oh.

05:09.567 --> 05:11.533
Anyway...I have a chance

05:11.567 --> 05:14.366
to be
Miss Weenie Tot.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.867
Do you know what that means?

05:15.901 --> 05:17.233
It means that if I win,

05:17.267 --> 05:18.966
I get to go
to supermarkets

05:19.000 --> 05:21.767
and hold a tray of Weenie Tots
in front of a cold freezer,

05:21.801 --> 05:25.500
while a bunch of old men
look up my dress.

05:25.534 --> 05:29.366
I have dreamt about this
since I was a little girl.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.767
And, if I win, I get
a year's supply of Weenie Tots.

05:32.801 --> 05:35.034
Hey.

05:36.033 --> 05:37.500
What's a Weenie Tot?

05:37.534 --> 05:39.834
What's a Weenie
Tot?!

05:39.868 --> 05:42.066
Peg, a Weenie Tot
is a delicious,

05:42.100 --> 05:43.433
little hot-dog-type
meat

05:43.467 --> 05:47.934
wrapped in a breaded shell
and deep-fried in pure lard.

05:48.734 --> 05:51.400
It's nature's
perfect food.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.567
All I need is $100 for a new
dress to impress the judges.

05:54.601 --> 05:56.600
Well, can the pathetic
dreams, Kel,

05:56.634 --> 05:58.300
'cause I got Dad's
last 100 right here

05:58.334 --> 05:59.900
to meet the president--

06:01.000 --> 06:02.633
Can it be true?

06:02.667 --> 06:03.867
My little girl,

06:03.901 --> 06:05.800
the symbol of
this country's superiority

06:05.834 --> 06:07.533
in chemically-treated food?

06:07.567 --> 06:09.567
And bringing home
those little weenies

06:09.601 --> 06:11.433
to dear old Dad.

06:11.467 --> 06:15.500
And maybe Daddy could share
these little weenies with Mommy.

06:18.868 --> 06:22.434
Listen...Gomez, Morticia.

06:23.367 --> 06:26.333
Surely you can't compare
bimboing around with pig parts

06:26.367 --> 06:28.966
to my meeting the president
of our United States.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.867
Well, we've only
got $100 left.

06:31.901 --> 06:33.600
It's a tough call.

06:33.634 --> 06:37.033
One...is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

06:37.067 --> 06:38.767
And the other...

06:38.801 --> 06:42.467
meeting the president.

06:42.501 --> 06:44.300
Gee, Al.

06:44.334 --> 06:46.967
What's a parent to do?

06:58.968 --> 07:01.600
I can't believe
I'm actually in the place

07:01.634 --> 07:04.401
where they make
Weenie Tots.

07:07.868 --> 07:09.400
Daddy, did you notice

07:09.434 --> 07:11.233
that there are
no garbage cans outside?

07:11.267 --> 07:14.900
Well, a lot of places now
are into recycling, honey.

07:16.501 --> 07:17.966
Attention, everyone.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.700
Mr. Shnick, president
of Weenie Tot Incorporated,

07:20.734 --> 07:22.233
will be with you
in a moment.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.667
He's just briefing
his vice presidents.

07:24.701 --> 07:25.834
Okay. Okay.

07:25.868 --> 07:27.667
The girls are gonna
be in here any minute.

07:27.701 --> 07:30.366
Now, remember, remember.
You're all vice presidents.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.400
Yeah, yeah.
Boobies!

07:31.434 --> 07:32.400
Boobies!

07:32.434 --> 07:34.334
Johnson!

07:35.033 --> 07:37.333
Now, you calm down.

07:37.367 --> 07:39.700
Okay, get them
in here, Flopsie.

07:40.801 --> 07:43.033
Oh, there they are.
Aren't they lovely?

07:43.067 --> 07:44.900
Come right in. Come right in.
Come right in.

07:44.934 --> 07:46.400
Make yourselves
comfortable.

07:46.434 --> 07:48.133
Thank you, girls.
Thank you-- Thank--

07:48.167 --> 07:50.800
Uh, whoa. Whoa.

07:50.834 --> 07:52.800
Hey, I told you boys
in Janitorial,

07:52.834 --> 07:54.133
you wanna
look at the girls,

07:54.167 --> 07:56.934
you gotta go around
and peek in the windows.

07:56.968 --> 07:58.667
Hey, I'm one of the parents.

07:58.701 --> 08:01.099
Uh, I'd just like to say
how much I love Weenie Tots.

08:01.133 --> 08:03.133
And, uh...

08:03.167 --> 08:05.767
What's the secret
ingredient?

08:17.033 --> 08:19.300
We're not allowed
to tell.

08:19.334 --> 08:20.633
Ah, well.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.966
Kelly,
good luck, honey.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.200
Mwah.

08:23.234 --> 08:26.567
I'm gonna go outside
and play with Flopsie now.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.066
You may be
wondering

08:32.100 --> 08:33.732
what a 25-year-old
millionaire

08:33.767 --> 08:37.900
is doing with
an 18-year-old daughter.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.600
Not really.

08:39.634 --> 08:41.767
Anyway...um...

08:41.801 --> 08:42.833
both her parents,

08:42.868 --> 08:44.966
especially
her mother...

08:45.000 --> 08:47.433
died in a flaming
car wreck.

08:47.467 --> 08:50.134
Sir, you're
spraying me.

08:51.767 --> 08:54.266
My name
is Butter Lefkowitz,

08:54.300 --> 08:57.533
and I hope one day
to be a doctor.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.867
My name is Rhonda Rose,

09:00.901 --> 09:04.867
and I believe
we must stop pollution.

09:06.534 --> 09:09.567
I'm Kelly,
pronounced "Kel-ee," Bundy,

09:09.601 --> 09:13.800
and I think guys with hooks
for hands are cool.

09:17.534 --> 09:20.033
And now for the all-important
talent competition.

09:20.067 --> 09:21.734
Dance.

09:35.767 --> 09:38.500
Armed with only
a long knife...

09:38.534 --> 09:41.733
I slayed the beast
that crushed my wife

09:41.767 --> 09:44.767
and left me alone
in my mansion

09:44.801 --> 09:47.067
with the world's
largest diamond.

09:48.467 --> 09:51.700
Does it smell
like feet in here?

09:52.534 --> 09:55.468
I don't smell anything.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.967
Give me one!

10:06.300 --> 10:08.200
Ok, here's the truth:

10:08.234 --> 10:10.767
I'm not 25.

10:10.801 --> 10:13.266
I'm not a millionaire.

10:13.300 --> 10:16.967
And, uh...those were my feet.

10:17.801 --> 10:19.300
But, uh...

10:19.334 --> 10:22.001
here's the real story.

10:22.501 --> 10:25.500
I'm Joe Namath.

10:26.834 --> 10:30.001
'Sixty-nine Superbowl, babe.

10:30.634 --> 10:32.999
That was me.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.800
Nineteen sixty-nine?

10:35.834 --> 10:39.134
I wasn't even born yet.

10:58.467 --> 11:00.468
Oh, Lord...

11:01.367 --> 11:04.266
I know I've come to you
a time or two in the past.

11:04.300 --> 11:07.600
Of course...you've been
less than receptive.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.767
Well, you know,
the wife thing,

11:09.801 --> 11:12.266
the shoe thing,
the life thing...

11:12.300 --> 11:14.999
But, Lord,
this time I have a chance

11:15.033 --> 11:18.266
at winning a year's supply
of Weenie Tots here.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.533
You know
how good they are.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.700
They're made up
of all your creatures.

11:21.734 --> 11:24.099
So...

11:24.133 --> 11:25.333
please let Kelly win.

11:25.367 --> 11:26.934
And if you do, I'll--

11:26.968 --> 11:28.867
I'll be nice to everyone I meet

11:28.901 --> 11:30.500
forever and ever.

11:30.534 --> 11:33.001
Amen.

11:35.067 --> 11:37.767
Daddy, I won!
I won!

11:38.100 --> 11:39.600
Oh!

11:41.801 --> 11:44.500
Get out of the way,
behemoth!

11:51.067 --> 11:53.633
<i>And so continues
our special half hour</i>

11:53.667 --> 11:55.934
<i>on the four plucky,
Chicago-area youths</i>

11:55.968 --> 11:58.467
<i>who have captured
the hearts of the nation.</i>

11:58.501 --> 12:00.300
<i>The meeting
with the president today.</i>

12:00.334 --> 12:02.333
<i>The ride inAir Force One.</i>

12:02.367 --> 12:05.733
<i>The gifts showered on them
from corporate America.</i>

12:05.767 --> 12:08.800
<i>But you have to wonder about
the mysterious fifth youth</i>

12:08.834 --> 12:11.667
<i>who didn't make the trip.</i>

12:11.701 --> 12:16.434
<i>Well...I guess he had
better things to do.</i>

12:18.067 --> 12:19.533
Hi, Bud.

12:19.567 --> 12:21.633
Gee, why so glum?

12:21.667 --> 12:24.633
Is it that
president thing again?

12:27.567 --> 12:29.133
Now, baby, come on.

12:29.167 --> 12:30.733
There will be plenty
of other

12:30.767 --> 12:33.133
once-in-a-lifetime
opportunities.

12:33.167 --> 12:35.467
Now, I know what would
make up for this.

12:35.501 --> 12:37.966
Let's go get ice cream.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.700
Ice cream?

12:39.734 --> 12:42.266
Do you think some lousy
chocolate sprinkles

12:42.300 --> 12:43.633
can make up
for this?

12:43.667 --> 12:46.366
I could've ridden
inAir Force One.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.233
Could've had
a scholarship to Harvard.

12:49.267 --> 12:50.700
I could've
been playing Nintendo

12:50.734 --> 12:53.001
with Dan Quayle
in the War Room.

12:56.534 --> 12:58.500
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened--

12:58.534 --> 13:00.033
Guess what!

13:00.067 --> 13:02.633
The Weenie Tots
are here!

13:07.133 --> 13:08.533
This is
the greatest day

13:08.567 --> 13:10.033
in the history
of the Bundys.

13:10.067 --> 13:11.999
Son, here.
No one can look glum

13:12.033 --> 13:14.267
with a Weenie Tot
on their tongue.

13:17.334 --> 13:18.700
What's the matter
with him?

13:18.734 --> 13:19.800
Oh, I don't know.

13:19.834 --> 13:21.099
I know what would
cheer him up.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.966
Let's take him out
for some ice cream.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.767
Spare me your love.
I'm going out.

13:24.801 --> 13:25.834
Where you going?

13:25.868 --> 13:28.500
Just to take
a nice nap in traffic.

13:28.534 --> 13:30.867
Well, don't forget
your jacket.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.733
Peg...I gotta
get back to work.

13:34.767 --> 13:37.834
But at least I've got something
now to put in my lunch box.

13:42.968 --> 13:45.500
Oh, look, Al.
Weenie Tots is running

13:45.534 --> 13:47.934
a new scratch-and-sniff
sweepstakes.

13:47.968 --> 13:50.300
"If your card smells
like a weenie,

13:50.334 --> 13:53.099
you win $50,000."

13:53.133 --> 13:55.200
Hey, let's open them all up
and see if we won.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.900
Peg, no.

13:56.934 --> 13:59.099
Read the label.

13:59.133 --> 14:00.166
"No nutritional value."

14:00.200 --> 14:01.800
No, keep reading.

14:01.834 --> 14:03.600
"This is not a food-- "

14:03.634 --> 14:06.433
No, no, no.
The fine print.

14:06.467 --> 14:10.066
"Do not expose
Weenie Tots to air.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.999
"Will accelerate
disintegration process.

14:13.033 --> 14:15.200
Enjoy."

14:15.234 --> 14:16.600
I want to know
if we won.

14:16.634 --> 14:20.300
Well, I can tell you that.
We're Bundys. We didn't.

14:20.334 --> 14:22.366
Now, Peg,
I've got a year's supply

14:22.400 --> 14:24.133
of my favorite mock food.

14:24.167 --> 14:29.500
<i>It, like me,
is highly unstable.</i>

14:29.534 --> 14:31.633
Al, if you don't want me
to touch them,

14:31.667 --> 14:33.467
just say "Don't touch them."

14:33.501 --> 14:34.533
Don't touch them.

14:34.567 --> 14:36.600
Then I won't.

14:50.133 --> 14:53.201
The place smells
like rat droppings.

14:55.601 --> 14:56.867
Oh, no!

14:56.901 --> 14:58.733
Woman,
what have you done?

14:58.767 --> 15:00.300
My tots!

15:00.334 --> 15:01.600
My tots!

15:01.634 --> 15:03.967
My weenies
have been exposed!

15:04.767 --> 15:07.600
You've disintegrated
my tots!

15:07.634 --> 15:09.467
Al, we didn't
win.

15:09.501 --> 15:11.934
Look what you've done
to my tots!

15:11.968 --> 15:13.567
Would you think about me
for once?

15:13.601 --> 15:15.099
I've ruined
my fingernails,

15:15.133 --> 15:17.900
and I've had
six nosebleeds.

15:17.934 --> 15:20.934
Well, there's one box left.
I may as well open it.

15:20.968 --> 15:22.467
Hm! Peg.

15:22.501 --> 15:24.033
Now, can we cut out
the usual charade

15:24.067 --> 15:26.133
of "I forbid you,
and you totally ignore me"?

15:26.167 --> 15:27.333
So how about this?

15:27.367 --> 15:29.066
Can I eat
the last box in peace?

15:29.100 --> 15:31.600
Can you wait one stinking minute
while I go to the fridge

15:31.634 --> 15:33.200
and get a beer
to wash them down?

15:33.234 --> 15:36.401
Of course, honey.

15:42.701 --> 15:44.867
Congratulations, Peg.

15:44.901 --> 15:47.800
You just won
a trip to Disneyfist.

15:48.701 --> 15:49.867
Oh, my God!
What?

15:49.901 --> 15:51.500
We won!
Fifty-thousand dollars?

15:51.534 --> 15:53.567
We won!
No!

15:57.801 --> 16:00.233
Peg. Peg. Where
do you wanna go?

16:00.267 --> 16:01.400
Hawaii.

16:01.434 --> 16:03.166
Okay. Then I shall
go to Europe.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.734
I love you.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.233
We're wasting time.
Let's pack.

16:09.267 --> 16:11.067
Okay.

16:22.834 --> 16:23.867
What's
going on?

16:23.901 --> 16:26.366
Nothing.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.434
Don't gimme
that.

16:31.567 --> 16:33.133
Ah-ha.

16:33.167 --> 16:35.133
You've won
the Weenie Tot Sniffstakes.

16:35.167 --> 16:37.166
We were just coming out
to tell you--

16:37.200 --> 16:39.967
Spare me
your pork-scented lies.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.567
At this point,

16:42.601 --> 16:45.667
I'm practically
raising myself anyway.

16:45.701 --> 16:47.066
So I'll tell you what.

16:47.100 --> 16:50.066
Just give me the money you have
in your pockets right now...

16:50.100 --> 16:51.967
we'll call it even.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.166
Okay.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.633
Ingrate.

17:03.634 --> 17:06.233
Goodbye, son.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.134
Goodbye,
loving parents.

17:10.901 --> 17:12.500
Oh!

17:12.534 --> 17:13.900
By the way.

17:13.934 --> 17:15.599
Here's a little something
to chat about

17:15.634 --> 17:17.133
on the way back
from the airport.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.500
You can't win.
You're ineligible

17:19.534 --> 17:21.500
because your
microbrained daughter

17:21.534 --> 17:23.300
is now
a Weenie Tot employee.

17:23.334 --> 17:26.300
We'll be poor
for the rest of our lives!

17:27.501 --> 17:29.401
Bite on that weenie!

17:38.434 --> 17:39.867
Is he right, Al?

17:39.901 --> 17:42.066
I'm afraid he is, Peg.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.633
Oh, what to do,
what to do.

17:44.667 --> 17:47.101
Well, maybe Kelly
can help us out of this.

17:47.868 --> 17:50.633
Boy, am I beat.

17:50.667 --> 17:51.733
All day long,

17:51.767 --> 17:53.533
cut the ribbon, wave.

17:53.567 --> 17:55.099
Cut the ribbon, wave.

17:55.133 --> 17:59.533
Heavy is the head of she
who wears the crown.

17:59.567 --> 18:01.667
Cut the ribbon, wave...

18:02.033 --> 18:03.467
Well, this is
a fine mess.

18:03.501 --> 18:06.700
She's an idiot,
and the smart one's mad at us.

18:06.734 --> 18:08.700
Hm...

18:08.734 --> 18:10.800
What we need is a dupe.

18:10.834 --> 18:13.900
Someone dishonest enough
to cash this ticket for us,

18:13.934 --> 18:17.733
yet...honest enough
not to run off with the money.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.433
In other words...

18:19.467 --> 18:22.134
<i>someone
mighty stupid.</i>

18:28.334 --> 18:31.999
So we're talking
a 50-50 split.

18:32.033 --> 18:33.500
What do you say?

18:33.534 --> 18:36.733
This is the lowest idea
I have ever heard.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.266
If you want someone to
cheat an American business,

18:39.300 --> 18:41.099
then you have come to
the wrong people.

18:41.133 --> 18:42.867
What you need, Al Bundy,
is a criminal.

18:42.901 --> 18:45.999
And I'm no criminal.
And I don't know anyone who is.

18:46.033 --> 18:48.001
I'll do it.

18:53.167 --> 18:54.567
What do you mean,
"I'll do it"?

18:54.601 --> 18:58.467
What part of "I'll do it"
didn't you understand?

18:58.501 --> 19:00.300
Let's just put aside

19:00.334 --> 19:02.633
the dishonesty
of this for a minute.

19:02.667 --> 19:04.166
At least remember

19:04.200 --> 19:06.900
that you are
a white-collar criminal.

19:06.934 --> 19:08.834
This man, at best,

19:08.868 --> 19:11.999
is a ring-around-the-collar
criminal.

19:12.033 --> 19:14.934
Now, honey, you don't
want to be in league

19:14.968 --> 19:17.166
with someone whose
greatest accomplishment

19:17.200 --> 19:19.066
has been putting shoes
on his knees

19:19.100 --> 19:21.567
and sneaking into
the movies as a child.

19:22.234 --> 19:23.999
Besides...

19:24.033 --> 19:28.133
I don't wanna wind up Bonnie
to this man's "Clod."

19:28.167 --> 19:31.700
Marcie, we're talking
about $50,000 here.

19:31.734 --> 19:35.067
That buys a lot
of motion lotion.

19:38.167 --> 19:40.167
Deal.

19:42.467 --> 19:45.266
<i>And so, the four
Chicago wonder kids</i>

19:45.300 --> 19:48.066
<i>arrived in Geneva for their
summit with Russian leader--</i>

19:48.100 --> 19:51.099
Come on. Let's get
some real news on here.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.200
<i>And now, the unusual story</i>

19:53.234 --> 19:55.700
<i>of the winning
of the Weenie Tot Sniffstakes,</i>

19:55.734 --> 19:58.101
<i>which occurred
a short time ago.</i>

20:05.601 --> 20:07.033
Hey...

20:07.067 --> 20:09.200
it looks like
Jefferson's getting ready

20:09.234 --> 20:11.101
to blow town
with his wife.

20:12.033 --> 20:14.767
<i>He's supposed to
blow town with me.</i>

20:14.801 --> 20:17.567
I mean, us.

20:17.601 --> 20:19.333
As Miss Weenie Tot,

20:19.367 --> 20:23.200
I am pleased to present
this check for $50,000

20:23.234 --> 20:25.700
to Mr. Jefferson D'Arcy...

20:25.734 --> 20:28.300
a man that I have
never, ever met before...

20:28.334 --> 20:30.266
and, I might add,

20:30.300 --> 20:31.966
does not live
next door to me,

20:32.000 --> 20:33.733
and has
no prearranged plans

20:33.767 --> 20:36.867
to split the money
with anyone in my family.

20:38.701 --> 20:40.633
So, what do you
plan to do

20:40.667 --> 20:43.468
with my daddy's money,
Mr. D'Arcy?

20:44.734 --> 20:46.966
What Mr. D'Arcy intends
to do with the money

20:47.000 --> 20:48.500
is to make partial
reparations

20:48.534 --> 20:51.667
to the aged and stupid
people he defrauded

20:51.701 --> 20:56.133
in the notorious Lake
Chicamakomoko land scandal.

20:56.167 --> 20:59.567
Good. Good. I'm glad.
Glad, I say.

20:59.601 --> 21:00.800
I knew this would happen

21:00.834 --> 21:04.200
<i>the moment I heard
Al Bundy was involved.</i>

21:04.234 --> 21:06.033
That's B-U-N-D--

21:06.067 --> 21:08.266
Hey, hey. That's
my mother's bracelet!

21:08.300 --> 21:09.500
I'm not the criminal.

21:09.534 --> 21:11.967
Al Bundy
is the criminal.

21:17.334 --> 21:19.400
Hi, Daddy.

21:19.434 --> 21:21.934
Leave town-ay.

21:21.968 --> 21:24.767
The jig is up-say.

21:31.334 --> 21:33.400
Gee, Al, uh,

21:33.434 --> 21:34.567
maybe I made
a mistake

21:34.601 --> 21:37.734
in letting Kelly
in on the plans.

21:43.868 --> 21:45.999
Well, honey,
at least it's over.

21:46.033 --> 21:49.201
Uh, no, Peg.
It's not over.

21:54.434 --> 21:57.700
Now it's over.

21:59.434 --> 22:02.366
What's for dinner tonight
in the slammer, guys?

22:02.400 --> 22:04.600
Same thing
every night.

22:04.634 --> 22:07.167
Weenie Tots.

22:07.934 --> 22:10.468
Book me.
