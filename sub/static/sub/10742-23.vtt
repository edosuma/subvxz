             [♪♪♪]

00:04.271 --> 00:05.770
                Now?

00:05.806 --> 00:08.707
  Yes, I can-- I can bring them
         over right now.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.342
        At the country club.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.011
             Yes, sir.
         Right away, sir.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.448
         Would you mind knocking
             the next time?

00:16.484 --> 00:17.916
     Certainly,
      master.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.684
      Where shall
      we go first?

00:19.720 --> 00:20.886
                Oh, uh, Jeannie,
                   I'm sorry.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.554
               Something very
          important has come up.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.123
              I won't be able
          to take you out today.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.357
   But you promised.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.159
This is Saturday,
and you're not working.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.560
And you said
that you would spend

00:28.595 --> 00:29.561
the <i> whole</i> day with me.

00:29.596 --> 00:30.595
                     Yes,
                 I know I did.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.264
            But General Peterson
              wants me to bring

00:32.299 --> 00:34.566
      some very important papers
     to him at the country club.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.268
                     And he's
                 in a big hurry.

00:36.303 --> 00:37.302
     A big hurry?

00:37.338 --> 00:38.337
                  A big hurry.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.311
              Oh. Good morning.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.714
                Good morning.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.016
                   Jeannie...

00:52.052 --> 00:53.352
                   Jeannie!

00:57.624 --> 01:00.592
             [♪♪♪]

01:43.237 --> 01:46.338
             [♪♪♪]

01:51.512 --> 01:53.045
                 Jeannie.
                 Jeannie!

01:54.381 --> 01:57.015
        Ooh,
    this is nice.

01:57.051 --> 01:59.784
It reminds me of
the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

01:59.819 --> 02:01.420
               Yes. Yeah, uh,
               Jeannie, look,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.121
              I-I could be
       court-martialed for this.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.589
             I don't mind being
              out of uniform.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.425
       Would you mind getting me
            dressed, please?

02:09.329 --> 02:10.562
                  Oh, uh...

02:10.597 --> 02:12.431
          Uh, my-- My briefcase,
                  please.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.667
 What is this place?

02:15.702 --> 02:17.635
                Oh, this is a--
                A golf course.

02:17.671 --> 02:18.670
                 A country club.

02:18.705 --> 02:19.671
            They play golf here.

02:19.706 --> 02:20.972
   Ooh. Do you play
      this golf?

02:21.007 --> 02:22.107
                    No, I don't.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.808
             Jeannie, I have
         a very important report

02:23.843 --> 02:25.377
                      to get to
                    the general.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.479
         Uh, why don't you look
       around here or something.

02:27.514 --> 02:28.947
      Oh, all right,
         master.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.549
              Maybe later on,
          if he doesn't need me,

02:30.584 --> 02:31.716
                I could take you
                   for a drive

02:31.751 --> 02:32.717
                     down to
                 the beach, huh?

02:32.752 --> 02:33.785
          Ohh...

02:33.820 --> 02:34.953
    Thank you, master.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.754
                Okay. You just
             take a look around.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.789
      All right.

02:42.028 --> 02:43.528
          Uh, general.
          Dr. Bellows.

02:43.564 --> 02:44.629
                       Tony,
                   you must live

02:44.664 --> 02:45.997
                  right next to
                the golf course.

02:46.032 --> 02:48.567
      The route I took, sir,
    there wasn't much traffic.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.670
Strange. When I drove out here,
    it was bumper-to-bumper.

02:51.705 --> 02:52.871
           Uh, I have
       the reports, sir.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.873
     The correlation tables
    worked out more or less

02:54.908 --> 02:55.874
      the way we expected.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.275
       You'll be pleased.
                      Good.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.845
     I wanna go over them before
     the meeting Monday morning.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.112
           Thanks for
        bringing it over.

03:01.147 --> 03:02.113
    Thank you, sir. Doctor.

03:02.148 --> 03:04.048
Goodbye, Major Nelson.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.586
                    Doctor,
              we have a problem.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.787
 I know, sir.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.622
   I'm keeping
  an eye on him.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.691
      I'm talking about the fact
         that Admiral Tugwell

03:12.726 --> 03:14.559
         and his aide are flying
           down here next week.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.595
Oh. They're coming down
to inspect the base?

03:16.630 --> 03:17.596
                   Oh, don't be
                      naive.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.130
                    They've seen
                      the base.

03:19.165 --> 03:21.399
    The admiral is coming down
          for some golf.

03:21.434 --> 03:22.667
      We do this once a year.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.370
       And he's beaten me
      seven years in a row.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.505
                       This year

03:26.540 --> 03:27.839
     I intend to beat <i> him.</i>

03:27.874 --> 03:29.641
   I wish you luck, general.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.743
      Now, the admiral and
 his aide shoot in the low 70s.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.211
            So do I.

03:33.246 --> 03:36.181
  But I can beat them if I can
find the right man to play with.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.818
Well, now...how about Henderson
         or Lukerthon?

03:39.853 --> 03:42.621
       Well, they're good,
       but not good enough.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.123
           I need someone
        who's almost a pro.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.391
            And that's
        where you come in.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.793
            [LAUGHS]

03:47.828 --> 03:49.661
       I don't play golf,
            general.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.830
     But you have the files
   of every man on the base.

03:53.033 --> 03:56.434
     I want you to find me
    the best golfer we have.

03:56.469 --> 03:59.504
   I'm not gonna let the Navy
   beat the Air Force again.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.706
       I understand, sir.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.941
I'll just make
a phone call.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.142
                    You do that.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.243
  Excuse me,
   general.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.486
                [WHISTLES]

04:15.522 --> 04:17.522
            That looks like fun.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.890
Well, hello, major.

04:18.926 --> 04:19.891
     It is fun.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.291
         I'm Jerry Barber.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.593
         I'm the professional
                here.

04:22.629 --> 04:23.861
         How do you do?
         Very nice to...

04:23.897 --> 04:25.129
   Would you like to try one?

04:25.165 --> 04:26.998
           Oh. Oh, I don't
          play golf. Sorry.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.633
  Oh, come on.
   Go ahead.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.634
               Really?

04:29.670 --> 04:30.669
    Please do.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.080
      Where did I go wrong?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.649
Major, put your feet
a little farther apart.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.687
Put your hands on the club
a little over here.
                       Okay.

04:48.722 --> 04:49.955
Bend over a little.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.122
Try it again.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.063
          Well, I'm afraid I'm
          not much of a golfer.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.232
Try it again,
major.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.901
Feet a little
farther apart.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.603
Bend over a little
at the waist.
                    Yeah.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.038
Hands a little firmer
on the club.
                 Right, right.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.440
               It's a lot harder
                 than it looks.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.343
          I'd like to be able to
          knock this ball about,

05:12.379 --> 05:15.280
                 oh, 400 yards
               down the fairway.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.348
   Well, major, I'm afraid
   there's very few people

05:17.384 --> 05:18.483
       that have ever
         done that.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.091
    And you're one of them.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.727
   That was a 400-yard drive.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.664
                 I got his name,
                     general.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.966
                       It's
                 Edward Sheldon.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.067
                    He shoots
                 in the low 70s.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.235
      Forget it.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.070
     I got a man
who shoots in the 60s.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.638
                 In the 60s?
               Who's that, sir?

05:40.673 --> 05:42.507
   Major Nelson.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.075
                 Tony Nelson?

05:44.111 --> 05:46.611
                 Oh...general,
               I happen to know

05:46.646 --> 05:48.012
               he doesn't even
                  play golf.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.814
   You really got it
in for him, haven't you?

05:49.849 --> 05:51.082
               Not at all, sir.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.451
             It's not my fault
           he doesn't play golf.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.719
                   I saw him
              at a driving range

05:54.754 --> 05:56.154
                    one day
              with Major Healey.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.489
                  Oh, he was
                  terrible.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.824
    He's good enough
to beat Admiral Tugwell.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.292
 I've been waiting
  for this chance

06:01.328 --> 06:03.394
  for seven years.

06:03.430 --> 06:06.397
           General...if you want
             to win that match,

06:06.433 --> 06:08.899
         I assure you, you're
      making a terrible mistake.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.502
    I'm not only
   gonna win it.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.870
    I'm doubling
    the stakes.

06:12.905 --> 06:15.340
  A 400-yard drive.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.974
Could you do that
again, major?

06:17.010 --> 06:19.310
                Oh, no. Never
             in a million years.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.012
                 It's just
               a lucky fluke.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.813
How about
trying it?

06:22.849 --> 06:24.616
            Well, all right.
       If you really want me to.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.924
You did it again.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.459
That's the most
remarkable drive

06:34.494 --> 06:36.027
I've ever seen
in my life.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.363
That's easily
400 yards.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.798
      Well, I...guess I'm better
            than I thought.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.567
Major, I guess
maybe you are too.

06:42.602 --> 06:43.768
Will you excuse me,
major?

06:43.803 --> 06:44.936
I've got a lesson.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.137
                     Oh. Oh.
   I'll have to
     be off.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.272
                   Very--
   Good luck
   to you.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.241
        Thank you. And thank you
          for the instruction.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.475
Thank you.
               How about that.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.544
                    Well...

06:53.580 --> 06:55.613
       [LAUGHS]
                Hi, Jeannie.

06:55.648 --> 06:57.048
               Jeannie, what?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.116
                Did...?

06:59.253 --> 07:00.919
               Oh, I see.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.021
                   Hey.
             It's Dr. Bellows.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.622
                  Ahem.

07:09.629 --> 07:10.962
 Major Nelson.

07:10.997 --> 07:11.963
                       Oh,
                   Dr. Bellows.

07:11.998 --> 07:13.898
      Have you
   taken up golf?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.900
       No, I'm afraid I'll never
         become a golfer, sir.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.168
Well, that's
what I thought.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.804
And yet I wouldn't
want to be wrong again.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.039
               Wrong about what?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.107
    Oh, nothing.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.308
Oh, would you mind
hitting a ball for me?

07:24.344 --> 07:25.476
                 And what for,
                     sir?

07:25.511 --> 07:27.812
Well, I-I'd just like to
see you hit the ball.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.215
             Oh, sort of, test
           my reflexes, sort of?

07:30.250 --> 07:31.515
Oh, something
like that.

07:31.551 --> 07:32.550
                   All right.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.388
You see, uh, the important thing
   is to grip the club firmly,

07:37.423 --> 07:38.956
                   uh, bend over
                      slightly

07:38.992 --> 07:40.324
           and keep your feet
              wide apart.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.068
Uh-huh.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.471
                I'm afraid that
               wasn't very good.

07:53.506 --> 07:54.605
                    I'll give it
                    another try.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.007
Oh, no, no, no.
I've seen enough.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.909
General Peterson
would like you

07:57.945 --> 08:00.245
to stop by his office
this afternoon.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.246
                 I wonder why?

08:01.281 --> 08:02.847
      So do I.

08:02.882 --> 08:04.916
     So do I.

08:04.952 --> 08:05.951
    [CHUCKLES]

08:07.020 --> 08:09.153
     Be your golf partner
       in a tournament?

08:09.188 --> 08:11.022
           Well, I'm afraid
        that's impossible, sir.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.590
  Impossible?

08:12.626 --> 08:13.992
Why is it impossible?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.392
                    Well, uh,
                 for one thing--

08:15.428 --> 08:17.996
You're not turning
professional, are you?

08:18.031 --> 08:19.030
                  Professional,
                      sir?

08:19.065 --> 08:20.331
                 I couldn't even
                  make amateur.

08:20.366 --> 08:21.399
      Ah!

08:21.434 --> 08:22.667
The admiral got to you.

08:22.702 --> 08:23.835
                    Oh. No, sir.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.336
               I don't know
          who's been telling you

08:25.371 --> 08:26.337
             I'm a great golfer.

08:26.372 --> 08:27.438
                  But they're
                  kidding you.

08:27.473 --> 08:28.807
                My average drive
                 is three feet.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.108
          That is, if the wind's
                 with me.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.876
     Tony, I don't want to
      pry into your life.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.044
     If you've given up golf,

08:33.078 --> 08:35.113
         I'm sure you had
       a good reason for it.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.179
          Given it up, sir?

08:36.216 --> 08:37.381
Well, maybe
it's taken up

08:37.417 --> 08:38.381
too much
of your time,

08:38.418 --> 08:39.650
or you gave someone
a promise

08:39.686 --> 08:41.019
not to play anymore.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.020
                   No, no, sir,
                I-I assure you--

08:43.056 --> 08:44.889
I don't care
what your reasons are.

08:46.292 --> 08:49.027
You're my partner
in that golf match Saturday.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.529
I want to win that

08:51.564 --> 08:53.632
more than I want to win
anything in my life.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.134
      And you're asking me
    to be your golf partner?

08:56.169 --> 08:58.202
       I'm not asking you.
         I'm telling you.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.303
Oh...

08:59.339 --> 09:02.674
        someone's in for
    a big surprise Saturday.

09:02.709 --> 09:03.775
     [LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY]

09:05.112 --> 09:06.845
             Whatever made you
           do a thing like that?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.479
    You did.
                       Me?

09:08.515 --> 09:11.282
  Well, you said you wanted
  to hit the ball 400 yards.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.984
              Yeah, well, why do
              you listen to me?

09:13.019 --> 09:14.786
      Because I want to
       make you happy.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.020
                  You want to
                 make me happy?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.122
        At my own court-martial
      you want to make me happy?

09:18.158 --> 09:20.124
 Jeannie, if I don't play
  that game on Saturday,

09:20.160 --> 09:21.592
General Peterson's
gonna think

09:21.627 --> 09:23.061
I'm the poorest sport
of the year.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.929
              And if I do play,
             he's gonna kill me.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.665
     Do not worry,
        master.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.034
   I will see that
   you play well.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.635
               Now, Jeannie,
          that's just the point.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.872
             I can't let you
         do something like that.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.074
      I-I don't know how it was
     in Baghdad in the old days,

09:36.109 --> 09:38.743
      but we have something here
      called, uh, sportsmanship.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.012
              You-- You simply
           don't cheat at games.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.314
          You finally got me
   in a spot I can't get out of.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.350
   Oh, I'm sorry,
      master.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.284
                   ROGER:
            Hello. Anybody home?

09:48.287 --> 09:50.755
      [LAUGHS]
                          Oh.

                   Hi, Tony.
                  Hi, Jeannie.

                Hey, listen.

                Do you two
               wanna laugh?

09:53.893 --> 09:55.359
           Because you won't
             believe this.

09:55.394 --> 09:57.995
   There's a rumor going around
  the base that General Peterson

09:58.031 --> 10:01.933
   picked you for his partner
for the big golf match Saturday.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.267
           Ha. Is that wild?

10:03.302 --> 10:04.535
                       Oh, yeah.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.938
                       It's also
                         true.
                 Ah.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.206
         You're not serious,
              are you?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.274
          No, I'm not serious,
        but General Peterson is.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.475
     But you don't play golf.

10:11.511 --> 10:12.977
           I know I don't.
         That's what I tried

10:13.013 --> 10:15.146
     to tell General Peterson,
      but he wouldn't listen.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.514
        It is my fault.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.185

          [CLICKING NOISE]

10:23.090 --> 10:25.356
        Well...I guess
     I'll be running along.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.258
            Now, wait a minute.
          I'm in trouble, Roger.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.859
     I know. That's why
     I'm running along.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.761
     I don't wanna tangle
    with General Peterson.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.031
   He thinks of golf the way
  most people think of mother.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.532
      Roger, somebody needs to
              help me

10:34.567 --> 10:35.900
     think of a way out of this.

10:35.936 --> 10:40.004
Well, you could have Jeannie
break General Peterson's arm.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.239
              That's it.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.675
     You want me to break
    General Peterson's arm?

10:43.710 --> 10:45.009
           No. No. My arm.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.078
          You want me
       to break your arm?

10:47.113 --> 10:49.713
  No, Jeannie. I don't want you
     to break anybody's arm.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.816
    But what's to stop me
from putting a sling on my arm

10:51.851 --> 10:53.684
   and telling General Peterson
          that I hurt it?

10:53.720 --> 10:54.985
              Oh!
                        ROGER:
                      Brilliant.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.954
      You can't play golf
   with your arm in a sling.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.925
                Thanks, Jeannie.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.627
          Well, I better go tell
             General Peterson

11:02.662 --> 11:03.828
                  that he's just
                   gonna have to

11:03.863 --> 11:05.496
            pick another partner
                for Saturday.

11:05.532 --> 11:06.497
        Well, good luck.

11:06.533 --> 11:07.532
                       Oh, yeah.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.303
Are you telling me
that Major Nelson

11:12.338 --> 11:13.838
has broken his arm?

11:13.873 --> 11:16.473
               No, sir. His arm
              is perfectly fine.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.708
Well, he has it
in a sling.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.143
               That's right. Hm.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.945
            I was wondering
      how Major Nelson was gonna

11:20.980 --> 11:23.281
              get out of playing
             in that golf match.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.381
                   Now we know.

11:28.288 --> 11:31.122
Major Nelson is in
Dr. Bellow's office.

11:31.157 --> 11:32.190
   I want him.

           Yes?

11:37.063 --> 11:39.297
  General Peterson would like to
      see you in his office.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.464
     Oh. Thank you
      very much.

11:40.499 --> 11:41.598

                          Yep.

      No.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.739
           I just got the flash.
           They're ready to pick

11:48.774 --> 11:50.607
            the astronauts
     for the Apollo test flight.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.009
      What?

11:52.045 --> 11:54.545
   Yeah, and I think they'd like
      someone with two arms.

11:54.580 --> 11:57.581
         You'll be able to spot
        all the classic symptoms

11:57.616 --> 11:59.917
                of the faker
           immediately, general.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.386
     When he comes in that door,
        notice his expression.

12:02.421 --> 12:04.322
              It'll be listless.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.157
           And the way he moves,

12:06.192 --> 12:09.226
           as though he's racked
                 with pain.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.130
        General Peterson.
     You want to see me, sir?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.640
    Aw, you should have seen
         the expression

12:22.676 --> 12:24.108
     on Dr. Bellows' face.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.043
            How did you explain
            the sling, master?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.811
  Well, luckily, I didn't
     tell Dr. Bellows

12:27.847 --> 12:29.113
   I had had an accident.

12:29.148 --> 12:31.048
         He told me
     I'd had an accident.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.485
   I am pleased that everything
   turned out so well, master.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.888
            Oh, yeah,
    everything's just great...

12:36.923 --> 12:38.389
    except for one tiny detail.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.390
          What is that?

12:39.426 --> 12:40.491
  Oh, I'm in the same trouble

12:40.527 --> 12:42.627
    I was when I walked out
         this morning.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.995
        General Peterson
        still expects me

12:45.031 --> 12:46.431
      to play in that game
          on Saturday.

12:46.966 --> 12:47.965
                [DOORBELL RINGS]

12:53.206 --> 12:55.673
  Hi, Tony. Hi, Jeannie.
          Ha-ha.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.674
Well, Merry Christmas

12:56.709 --> 12:58.476
from your friendly
golf instructor.

12:58.511 --> 12:59.777
               Roger,
        wha-what's all this?

12:59.812 --> 13:01.345
This is a solution
to your problems.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.014
     I'm going to teach you
       how to...play golf.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.317
          You see, master,
       your problem is solved.

13:06.352 --> 13:07.885
       You really think
      you can do it, Roge?

13:07.921 --> 13:09.987
Well, at least when you
get out there Saturday...

13:10.023 --> 13:13.191
you won't make a complete
fool out of yourself.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.992
        Well, Roger, I certainly
            appreciate this.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.161
Well, let's see
how you can putt, huh?

13:17.197 --> 13:18.929
        Yeah.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.231
      Just follow
    my instructions,

13:20.267 --> 13:22.599
and you won't
have any problems.
                    All right.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.769
Just hold a club like this,
nice and relaxed.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.472
                  All right.
                  All right.
      Okay?

13:27.507 --> 13:28.906
Now, bend over.
                   Bend over.

13:28.941 --> 13:30.908
Head over the ball.
             Head over the ball.

13:30.943 --> 13:31.976
    Feet apart.
                  Feet apart.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.544
    Knees together.
                Knees together.

13:33.580 --> 13:34.878
Now, just...

13:34.914 --> 13:36.847
 relax the wrist.
                Relax the wrist.

13:36.882 --> 13:39.584
Right there. Now, just
a short backswing.

13:39.619 --> 13:40.684
              Short backswing.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.685
Follow through

13:41.721 --> 13:42.853
and hit the ball.
               Right.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.025
     Would you like me to move
       the cup to the ball?

13:48.060 --> 13:49.827
                      Jeannie.

13:49.862 --> 13:51.629
Well...you only
missed it by a room.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.531
           Naturally, it's gonna
           take me a little time

13:53.566 --> 13:54.532
             to get the hang
                 of it.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.866
Yeah, naturally,
naturally.

13:55.901 --> 13:57.502
           How long do you think
              it's gonna take

13:57.537 --> 13:58.869
               before I'm ready
                for the match?

13:58.904 --> 14:00.271
If you practice hard
every day?

14:00.306 --> 14:01.772
            Yeah, if I practice
              hard every day.

14:01.807 --> 14:03.674
 About 1985.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.813
             Golf clubs,
             golf shoes.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.115
             Got my golf tees.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.350
            Golf balls.
            Golf balls!

14:12.385 --> 14:13.451
Here they are,
master.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.753
             Oh. Thank you,
                Jeannie.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.121
             What are you
          all dressed up for?

14:17.157 --> 14:19.390
I'm going to
the tournament with you.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.558
                Oh. Oh.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.627
               Fine. Fine.

14:22.662 --> 14:23.861
You do not mind?

14:23.896 --> 14:25.463
                  No,
             of course not.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.497
        Uh, why should I mind?

14:26.533 --> 14:27.498
                 You could
                always, uh--

14:27.534 --> 14:28.832
             You could always
               caddy for me.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.236
Oh, I would be happy to.
Whatever that is.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.104
                Oh, well, it's
                 very simple.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.240
           Uh, you take a tee
    like this you see, and you--

14:36.276 --> 14:38.242
      Oh, would you mind getting
         that for me, please?

14:38.278 --> 14:39.477
   Oh, certainly,
      master.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.217
          I'm sorry about this,
                Jeannie,

14:46.252 --> 14:48.819
  but you're gonna have to stay
 in there until the game's over.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.587
            But you need me,
                master.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.256
     Yeah. Yeah, I know I do.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.891
     But the force of genies

14:53.926 --> 14:54.925
        aren't allowed.

14:58.364 --> 14:59.630
            Oh.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.270
  Hey, I think your partner's
       got cold feet

15:06.305 --> 15:07.538
    and isn't gonna
       show up.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.173
        Oh, he'll be along.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.008
          He doesn't know
      what sharks you two are.

15:11.044 --> 15:14.178
Well, we'll try and give him
a good game, general.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.179
             Sorry I'm late,
                  sir.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.280
                    Oh, this is
                   Major Nelson.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.515
                         Admiral
                        Tugwell.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.317
 Nice knowing you,
      major.
               Pleasure, sir.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.718
                     Commander
                      Davis.
How do you do?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.520
    What do you--
  What's your game?

15:22.555 --> 15:23.654
 What do you shoot?

15:23.689 --> 15:25.123
                 Well,
             quail mostly.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.625
                 PETERSON:
              He's too smart
          to give anything away.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.027
             You'll see when you
              put your money up.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.396
        Pete, would you like to
      double last year's stakes?

15:33.366 --> 15:34.598
                       Well,
                   I don't know.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.633
        You know, Major Nelson's
          not much of a player.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.734
                     He's, uh...

15:37.770 --> 15:38.735
                         Well,
                    he's kind of

15:38.771 --> 15:41.238
                   a last-minute
                    replacement,

15:41.274 --> 15:42.673
                        but, uh,
                        still...

15:42.708 --> 15:45.042
                     I'll double
                     the stakes.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.043
       Done.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.211
      Done?

15:47.247 --> 15:49.880
Sir, could I speak to you
a moment privately?

15:49.916 --> 15:52.850
       Major, no secret strategy
           meetings, please.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.618
                     I'll talk
                   to you later.

15:54.653 --> 15:55.720
          Yeah, I'm sure
            you will.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.487
             Well, come on.
        Let's get some practice.

16:13.873 --> 16:14.839
Hey,
nice drive.

16:14.874 --> 16:15.873
                     Good one,
                     commander.

16:15.908 --> 16:16.907
         Very good,
            sir.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.077
You think you can
follow that, general?

16:20.113 --> 16:21.112
                       Yeah.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.652
                 Good luck,
                    sir.

16:29.121 --> 16:30.555
       Oh, thank you,
           major.

16:34.293 --> 16:35.259
                   Very good,
                      sir.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.760
                      Very good.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.796
                [CHUCKLES]

16:38.831 --> 16:40.798
        You didn't come out here
          for nothing, did you?

16:43.303 --> 16:45.236
                   Well, anchors
                       aweigh.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.444
                 Nice shot, Roy.
    Oh, yeah. Very nice.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.349
         Oh, me.
                    TUGWELL:
               All right, major.

17:11.763 --> 17:12.796
                       Oh.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.137
            Ahem.

17:25.678 --> 17:26.978
                      Tricky
                   little devil.
       Oh, yes.

17:28.314 --> 17:30.414
  You're not going to use
  an iron, are you, major?

17:30.450 --> 17:31.415
         What, sir?

17:31.451 --> 17:33.016
                       Here,
                  use my driver.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.518
           Oh. Thank you.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.627
     I can't even see it.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.695
     The ball is still
        on the tee.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.466
             Ahem.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.670
           Sir, I'd l-- I'd like
             to explain. Um...

17:52.705 --> 17:53.838
You don't have to
explain.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.439
That was brilliant.

17:55.474 --> 17:56.440
                   Brilliant?

17:56.475 --> 17:57.675
Why didn't I
think of that?

17:57.710 --> 17:59.844
You just keep on pretending
that you're a dub.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.079
Then at the last minute
you'll come through,

18:02.114 --> 18:03.848
and we'll
wallop them.

18:05.317 --> 18:06.350
              [LAUGHS]
                Yes.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.173
                Don't overdo it.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.009
                   These guys
               are pretty smart.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.177
         They know that no one
           could be that bad.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.017
             We'll concede that,
                   major.

18:40.053 --> 18:42.653
         We do want to finish
       the 18 holes before dark.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.656
               That's all right,
                    major.

18:45.691 --> 18:47.758
                  You're only
              16 strokes behind.

18:50.229 --> 18:51.828
                      Ahem.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.365
Don't you think you
ought to start now, Tony?

18:54.400 --> 18:55.399
               I have started,
                    sir.

18:55.434 --> 18:57.167
             What you're seeing
                is my game.

18:57.202 --> 18:58.168
 All right.

18:58.203 --> 18:59.936
But don't keep it up
too long.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.010
         Ahem.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.316
Roger, what are you
doing here?

19:12.351 --> 19:15.452
    Well, I thought I'd stop by
   and see how my pupil's doing.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.487
My score is 29.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.822
            Oh, you're kidding.
On the third hole.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.393
        Are you keeping your eye
              on the ball?

19:22.428 --> 19:24.595
I'm keeping my eye on a jet
that'll take me to Brazil.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.230
Roger, I'm
getting slaughtered.

19:27.266 --> 19:28.766
I don't mind
so much for myself.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.967
But if we lose, it's
gonna kill General Peterson.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.670
           Yeah, and if it kills
             General Peterson,

19:32.705 --> 19:33.804
                 it's going to
                   kill you.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.238
               Why isn't Jeannie
                    helping?

19:35.274 --> 19:36.573
  Well, uh...

19:36.609 --> 19:37.874
you know how she is.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.677
            Yeah, she's great.
          She's here, isn't she?

19:39.712 --> 19:41.345
Roge, I don't want to
hold up the game.

19:41.380 --> 19:42.413
                Wait a minute.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.114
                 Why don't you
              have her help you?

19:44.149 --> 19:45.816
