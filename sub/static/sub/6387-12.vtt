This one's not
your lady anymore, Hank.

00:04.786 --> 00:06.870
If you absolutely have to be
with someone else,

00:06.905 --> 00:07.976
this is the right guy.

00:08.096 --> 00:10.371
It's great to see you,
I'm so glad you could make it.

00:10.491 --> 00:11.741
Loving that man-gina.

00:11.776 --> 00:13.415
It is fucking liberating.

00:13.449 --> 00:15.854
I think I made
a terrible mistake, you know?

00:15.889 --> 00:17.626
Having a pool is awesome.

00:17.661 --> 00:20.131
Having a husband
in rehab is even better.

00:20.166 --> 00:21.367
And you're fucking fired...

00:21.401 --> 00:23.172
as an agent and a friend.

00:23.207 --> 00:24.710
Bates is coming back tomorrow.

00:24.744 --> 00:28.047
So we've got tonight?

00:28.081 --> 00:30.654
I am letting go
and letting God.

00:30.688 --> 00:31.890
I'm gonna go.

00:31.925 --> 00:33.826
Oh, you have a little
flotsam and jetsam there.

00:33.860 --> 00:35.931
You just blew him again,
didn't you?

00:35.966 --> 00:38.137
What the fuck?

00:38.171 --> 00:40.573
Karen does not understand what
I'm going through right now.

00:40.607 --> 00:42.912
I'm just tired of always
keeping it together

00:42.946 --> 00:44.647
for someone else, you know?

00:44.681 --> 00:48.519
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

00:48.554 --> 00:50.479
I am a better,
younger version of you,

00:50.599 --> 00:53.159
so just fuck off, old man.

Karen...

03:33.909 --> 03:38.347
Karen, these last couple of
years have been absolute bliss.

03:38.381 --> 03:39.715
I mean, living here with you

03:39.749 --> 03:43.019
has been the most peaceful
chapter of my story to date.

03:46.157 --> 03:50.861
But, I mean, no matter
how beautiful the grounds...

03:50.895 --> 03:53.197
I mean, this place is a zoo.

03:53.231 --> 03:55.966
And I'm a wild animal.

03:56.001 --> 03:59.537
Sobriety...Sobriety is not
the answer for me.

03:59.571 --> 04:01.906
I-I need to be unleashed.

04:01.940 --> 04:05.810
I belong out there...
in the wilderness.

04:05.844 --> 04:08.512
Okay.

04:08.547 --> 04:11.582
So...
What are you saying?

04:11.616 --> 04:14.852
I'm saying that--
that you are the best thing

04:14.886 --> 04:17.454
that has ever happened to me.

04:17.488 --> 04:21.059
I will love you
till the very end of time.

04:21.093 --> 04:22.693
But I can no longer
be your husband.

04:22.728 --> 04:25.830
Oh, God.

04:25.864 --> 04:28.099
I'm so sorry, my love.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.668
No, I--
Oh, my God.

04:30.702 --> 04:31.869
I know it's upsetting.

04:31.903 --> 04:33.537
It's such a fucking relief!

04:33.572 --> 04:36.606
I know, right?
It's fucking liberating!

04:36.640 --> 04:39.542
- Oh, that's my cue.
- No, Hank, please stay.

04:39.576 --> 04:41.043
I have something
to say to you too.

04:41.077 --> 04:42.344
Please sit.

04:42.378 --> 04:44.980
Okay, this should
be interesting.

04:47.016 --> 04:49.784
Listen...

04:49.818 --> 04:53.655
Look, the three of us...

04:53.689 --> 04:57.358
We share something spectacular.

04:57.393 --> 04:59.093
We all love each other.

04:59.128 --> 05:00.595
I'm not having sex
with you, Bates.

05:00.629 --> 05:03.365
That's not what
I'm suggesting, Hank.

05:03.399 --> 05:05.767
But let me
tell you something, kitten.

05:05.802 --> 05:08.036
It would rock
your fucking world.

05:08.071 --> 05:10.005
I'm sure, I'm sure.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.407
Jesus.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.208
Look, our lives
are gonna be over

05:13.243 --> 05:15.311
in the blink of a fucking eye.

05:15.345 --> 05:17.413
I mean, this is why
I have to go.

05:17.447 --> 05:20.450
I-I can't live
a compromised life any longer.

05:21.786 --> 05:25.589
But you two,
there's still love here.

05:25.623 --> 05:27.691
I know it like I know myself.

05:27.725 --> 05:29.159
- No, no, no, but--
- No, no, no, no.

05:29.194 --> 05:30.527
- No buts!
- Listen to me.

05:30.561 --> 05:33.330
Karen, listen to me.

05:33.364 --> 05:38.867
And you, you know,
with all your shenanigans,

05:38.902 --> 05:41.770
man, it's just a way
to keep her at arm's length.

05:41.804 --> 05:43.471
- What?
- Because you're scared.

05:43.506 --> 05:44.806
What if I'm like you?

05:44.840 --> 05:46.574
You know,
destined to roam free?

05:48.009 --> 05:50.777
Hank, you're not like me.
You're not a warrior.

05:50.812 --> 05:53.080
Listen, if we were members
of the same tribe,

05:53.115 --> 05:54.749
I mean, I'd be out hunting
and gathering.

05:54.783 --> 05:57.619
You'd be home with the women.

05:57.653 --> 05:59.254
Well, that--that sounds
like a way better job.

05:59.289 --> 06:02.424
Exactly, because you're not
an adventurer.

06:02.458 --> 06:04.761
You're lazy and passive
and entitled and--

06:04.795 --> 06:07.130
- Okay, okay, I got it.
- No, no.

06:07.164 --> 06:11.167
But most of all,
and best of all...

06:11.201 --> 06:12.601
You are a lover.

06:20.376 --> 06:21.676
All right, that's it.

06:21.710 --> 06:23.544
I've said my piece.

06:23.578 --> 06:26.981
My wisdom's yours,
so do with it what you will.

06:27.015 --> 06:29.016
Come here.

06:34.356 --> 06:39.360
All right.
So, until we meet again...

06:39.395 --> 06:42.998
Lovers.

06:50.841 --> 06:54.477
- How you doing over there?
- I'm okay.

07:12.861 --> 07:16.831
This day is turning out to be
a lot cooler than expected.

07:16.865 --> 07:19.400
What you said.

07:19.435 --> 07:22.703
- Now what?
- I don't know.

07:22.738 --> 07:24.238
Picture this--

07:24.272 --> 07:26.774
We pack a bag,
and we drive to the airport.

07:26.808 --> 07:28.475
We buy two tickets
to paradise--

07:28.509 --> 07:30.043
maybe three,
if Becca wants to come with--

07:30.077 --> 07:31.845
and then we just go.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.848
We figure out the rest later.

07:34.882 --> 07:37.717
No.

07:37.751 --> 07:40.953
- No?
- No.

07:40.987 --> 07:43.355
- It's because...
- It was worth a shot.

07:43.390 --> 07:45.624
Your solution to everything
is to run away.

07:45.658 --> 07:47.792
- Mm.
- How about...

07:47.827 --> 07:50.462
You stay here,
stand still, don't move?

07:50.496 --> 07:52.230
Here, tonight,
have dinner with me...

07:52.264 --> 07:53.731
- Uh-huh.
- In this house.

07:53.766 --> 07:56.702
- Hey, that sounds heavenly.
- All right.

07:56.736 --> 07:58.304
Then what?
I don't know.

07:58.338 --> 08:00.473
We just wait,
and we see what happens.

08:00.507 --> 08:04.044
Cool. So we just
see what happens next.

08:04.078 --> 08:05.779
Well, I've got
a pretty good idea.

08:05.814 --> 08:09.617
- That was weird.
- I could see that one coming.

08:09.651 --> 08:12.453
Mmm.
Can I ask you a favor?

08:12.488 --> 08:15.323
- Isn't this a favor?
- Oh, this is a huge favor,

08:15.357 --> 08:17.926
but I also need
a little one too.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.695
- Can you call Becca for me?
- Right now?

08:22.197 --> 08:23.965
No, after is fine.

08:26.468 --> 08:28.837
You had to get mom
to do your dirty work?

08:28.871 --> 08:32.073
Well, I just want
to explain myself.

08:32.107 --> 08:33.875
You don't have to do that.

08:33.909 --> 08:36.010
So why are you still mad at me?

08:36.044 --> 08:38.346
Because violence wasn't
the way to solve the problem.

08:38.381 --> 08:40.048
It's my problem to solve.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.816
But your problem
is my problem, sweetie.

08:41.851 --> 08:44.552
Your work is done, dad.
I am who I am.

08:44.586 --> 08:46.988
I have to make my own mistakes.

08:47.022 --> 08:51.192
Okay, I get it.
I'm sorry.

08:51.227 --> 08:53.995
Apology half-accepted.

08:54.029 --> 08:56.965
So where does that
leave the two of you now?

08:56.999 --> 08:59.801
Like I said, I broke up
with him, told him to fuck off.

08:59.835 --> 09:01.602
And then he broke down,
said how sorry he was,

09:01.637 --> 09:03.671
how it was a huge mistake
and it would never happen again.

09:03.705 --> 09:05.673
Yeah.
Heard that before, huh?

09:05.708 --> 09:07.308
Said that before.

09:07.343 --> 09:09.144
It was a convincing case.
We made love.

09:09.178 --> 09:11.546
Ha, you're funny.

09:11.580 --> 09:14.115
- We did.
- Gross!

09:14.150 --> 09:16.985
Honey, why you got to do that?

09:17.019 --> 09:18.753
Sorry.

09:18.787 --> 09:21.489
I mean--no, it's okay.
It's not okay.

09:21.524 --> 09:23.391
I don't think--
I mean, I just...

09:23.425 --> 09:25.627
I'm never going
to get used to that shit.

09:25.661 --> 09:27.562
I won't.

09:27.596 --> 09:28.863
And then he asked me
to marry him.

09:28.897 --> 09:31.199
You are funny.

09:31.233 --> 09:33.635
- He did!
- He did? What a clown.

09:33.670 --> 09:37.674
I said yes.

09:37.708 --> 09:40.944
I think I'm going to be sick.
You know...

09:40.979 --> 09:42.980
I know I joke about that a lot,
but I'm serious.

09:43.014 --> 09:46.750
Seriously, I'm--

09:49.221 --> 09:51.656
Holy shit!
Dad, are you okay?

09:51.690 --> 09:55.593
No, of course I'm not okay.
I'm woozy.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.596
Look, just because he asked
and I said yes

09:57.630 --> 09:59.597
doesn't mean it's going
to happen anytime soon.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.432
- All right.
- And don't tell mom, okay?

10:01.466 --> 10:03.801
- I want to tell her myself.
- All right.

10:03.835 --> 10:06.103
Shit, break's over.
I gotta get back to work.

10:06.137 --> 10:07.404
Okay.

10:07.439 --> 10:10.241
- Love you, dad.
- Love you too.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.528
So what happened?

10:28.563 --> 10:32.232
- Uh...Lizzie quit.
- What?

10:32.267 --> 10:34.735
Yeah, fucking little bitch.

10:34.769 --> 10:36.837
She said something about
how she needed more time to...

10:36.871 --> 10:39.006
focus on her career.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.607
I had no idea.

10:40.642 --> 10:42.075
Oh, really?

10:42.110 --> 10:44.511
I'm surprised, what, with
you two being so fucking close

10:44.545 --> 10:46.246
and her blowing
other guys and all.

10:46.280 --> 10:50.251
Please, don't remind me.

10:50.285 --> 10:52.553
I know about Stu and Lizzie.

10:52.587 --> 10:54.422
Oh, thank God.

10:54.456 --> 10:57.058
It was so hard for me
to hold it in.

10:57.093 --> 11:00.228
So, so...
How are you handling it?

11:00.263 --> 11:03.832
Oh...
You didn't know, did you?

11:03.867 --> 11:05.067
But now you do.

11:05.101 --> 11:07.503
Yep.
Now I know!

11:07.537 --> 11:09.839
I'm so sorry, Marcy.
You tricked me!

11:09.873 --> 11:12.241
Well, why the fuck
didn't you tell me?

11:12.275 --> 11:13.675
Because in my advanced
middle age,

11:13.710 --> 11:15.177
I've learned one thing,

11:15.211 --> 11:16.911
and that's ignorance
truly is bliss.

11:16.946 --> 11:20.114
Oh, God damn it,
it's these hot, young skanks

11:20.148 --> 11:22.216
with their tight pussies
and their perfect tits.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.918
- It's a fucking epidemic!
- That is so true!

11:24.953 --> 11:27.321
They can't be stopped.
They're marriage killers.

11:27.355 --> 11:30.323
Oh, okay, okay, it's okay.

11:30.358 --> 11:33.226
No!
God damn it, Irma!

11:33.261 --> 11:34.828
Can you give us
a fucking minute?

11:34.863 --> 11:36.029
<i>Dios mio,</i> woman!

11:36.064 --> 11:38.833
I sorry, but the boy--
he talking!

11:38.867 --> 11:40.301
- Say--say again!
- Blow job!

11:42.404 --> 11:45.007
Blow job!

11:45.041 --> 11:46.642
That's so good.
You're talking!

11:46.676 --> 11:49.879
Oh, my baby!
He's so good!

11:49.913 --> 11:52.248
Don't ever say that word again.

11:52.282 --> 11:53.916
Not a nice word.

11:53.950 --> 11:55.317
What, where--
where are you going?

11:55.352 --> 11:57.452
- I'm going to the set because--
- Blow job.

11:57.487 --> 12:00.355
I have to see a soon to be
ex-husband about a blow job.

12:00.389 --> 12:02.590
- Well, it was two, actually.
- Blow job.

12:02.624 --> 12:04.058
- What?
- Blow job.

12:04.092 --> 12:06.360
- That's even worse.
- That's exactly what I said.

12:06.394 --> 12:07.861
And they told me
it was no big deal,

12:07.895 --> 12:09.029
that two was the same as one.

12:09.063 --> 12:11.397
- Blow job.
- That is fucking bullshit!

12:11.431 --> 12:13.599
I know, right?
Here, you're too upset.

12:13.634 --> 12:15.067
I'm going to drive you.
Let's go.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.736
Yes, okay.
Yes, I'm too upset.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.170
Blow job!

12:18.205 --> 12:21.073
Michael Bay would think
this is ridiculous.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.241
Michael Mann would think
this is ridiculous.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.677
Paul Greengrass would think
this is ridiculous.

12:25.711 --> 12:28.946
I don't care if we go
to 3-D or not.

12:28.980 --> 12:31.182
Bullshit still looks
like bullshit.

12:31.216 --> 12:32.316
Michael Bay?

12:32.351 --> 12:34.319
He would--
he would laugh at me right now.

12:34.353 --> 12:37.456
I'm sure he is
somewhere laughing at me.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.125
And I've got a fucking actor who
won't come out of his trailer?

12:40.160 --> 12:43.430
You're the director--you have
to show them who's boss!

12:43.464 --> 12:44.431
I'm scared.

12:44.465 --> 12:46.633
What the fuck?

12:46.668 --> 12:49.737
Holy shit.
God.

12:49.771 --> 12:51.372
Hank, thank God.

12:51.406 --> 12:53.073
You must have read
my fucking mind.

12:53.108 --> 12:55.776
- Did you call him?
- No, but I was just about to.

12:55.810 --> 12:57.177
What the fuck, Stu?
I told you!

12:57.212 --> 12:58.579
I told you
I never want to see his ass

12:58.613 --> 13:00.380
on one of my sets ever again.

13:00.415 --> 13:01.448
Oh, oh, excuse me.

13:01.482 --> 13:03.349
So this is your set
all of a sudden?

13:03.384 --> 13:05.351
Listen, this is
a producer-driven medium,

13:05.385 --> 13:07.253
you ineffectual
little shitbird.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.187
Shut the fuck up, both of you.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.356
I'm looking for that other
little shitbird Tyler.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.625
Well, you're not the only one
looking for him, Hank.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.161
Sam's got a big bug
up his ass about that guy.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.698
He won't come
out of his trailer,

13:18.732 --> 13:20.467
and we're, you know, scared
to go in there, so...

13:25.239 --> 13:27.040
Hey, Sam.

13:27.075 --> 13:30.211
If you missed me this much,
you could have called or sexted.

13:30.245 --> 13:32.646
You didn't have to cause
such a ruckus.

13:32.681 --> 13:34.348
This time I didn't bring
the ruckus, Moody.

13:34.382 --> 13:35.883
The fucking ruckus
came to me, man.

13:35.917 --> 13:38.885
All right, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.821
I talked to Stu
about giving Kali

13:40.855 --> 13:42.489
a small part
in this joint and shit.

13:42.523 --> 13:44.524
So I go over
to her trailer to talk

13:44.558 --> 13:46.526
about putting a baby
up in that ass, you know?

13:46.560 --> 13:48.761
She gonna tell me
we ain't fucking no more.

13:48.796 --> 13:50.463
She don't love me.
She ain't never gonna love me.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.831
Then she gonna tell me

13:51.865 --> 13:54.300
she fucking got
with Tyler last night, man.

13:54.335 --> 13:56.769
I fucking lost my shit, yo,
trashed her trailer.

13:56.804 --> 13:59.673
Now I gotta fucking kill
that little cracker, man.

13:59.708 --> 14:00.941
Or have somebody do it for me,

14:00.976 --> 14:03.144
which fucking sucks,
because I want the satisfaction

14:03.178 --> 14:04.679
of doing that shit myself,
you know?

14:04.713 --> 14:07.015
Don't do it.

14:07.049 --> 14:08.617
Just let it go.

14:13.389 --> 14:14.556
I don't know, man.

14:14.590 --> 14:15.924
You do something nice
for people--

14:15.958 --> 14:17.892
they take advantage of that
shit over and over again.

14:17.927 --> 14:19.860
- I'm a good dude, Moody.
- I know you are.

14:19.895 --> 14:21.962
You're just like me.
You're misunderstood.

14:21.997 --> 14:24.598
Exactly. And I can be pushed
to the brink, man.

14:24.633 --> 14:26.033
And when that shit happens,

14:26.067 --> 14:28.368
I don't give a fuck
about nothing or nobody, man.

14:28.403 --> 14:30.103
That's when
the apocalypse come out.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.871
That's how I got
that fuckin' name, my nigga,

14:31.905 --> 14:33.039
because, yo, I'm three seconds

14:33.073 --> 14:34.440
from blowing this whole
fucking world up.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.375
Yeah, okay, okay,
but--but think about it Sam.

14:36.410 --> 14:37.910
This is your moment--

14:37.945 --> 14:40.046
your Eddie Murphy
movie-star moment.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.615
Who gives a fuck about the Kalis
and Tylers of the world?

14:42.649 --> 14:43.783
They're nothing.

14:43.817 --> 14:46.552
But you're
Samurai fucking Apocalypse.

14:46.587 --> 14:48.921
That's all well and cool, man.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.656
I still think I should ice
that motherfucker.

14:50.691 --> 14:51.991
Please don't.

14:52.026 --> 14:53.693
My daughter loves
that floppy-haired mope.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.662
I'm not sure exactly why,
but she does.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.965
I got little girls, man.
I can relate to that shit.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.668
So what--
I don't kill this motherfucker,

15:02.702 --> 15:04.503
your daughter don't get
her heart broken?

15:04.537 --> 15:06.171
Exactly.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.739
Maybe that's the move, yeah.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.074
Oh, that's the move, Sam.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.076
Mos def...

15:11.110 --> 15:12.845
...initely.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.592
Let's fire this motherfucker
up, yo, come on.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.827
Yes! Yes!

15:28.862 --> 15:31.197
Yes! Yes!

15:31.231 --> 15:33.699
You, you're welcome.

15:33.734 --> 15:35.701
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I just saved your life.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.370
And you know how you're going
to repay the favor?

15:38.405 --> 15:40.039
You're going to stay the fuck
away from my daughter,

15:40.073 --> 15:41.307
and you're going to rescind

15:41.341 --> 15:43.675
that stupid fucking
marriage proposal, you hear me?

15:43.710 --> 15:46.045
All evidence to the contrary...

15:46.079 --> 15:47.780
I love her Hank.
I do.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.381
I believe you.
I do.

15:49.415 --> 15:50.682
But you're years away

15:50.716 --> 15:53.151
from having any kind
of real relationship with her.

15:53.185 --> 15:55.020
You're like a kid
in a candy store now.

15:55.054 --> 15:56.087
So--so go wild.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.257
Fuck two of everything.
Have fun.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.660
Just don't torture her
while you're doing it, okay?

16:01.695 --> 16:03.195
You're making a lot
of sense right now.

16:03.229 --> 16:05.164
Yeah, I'm having a good day...

16:05.198 --> 16:06.899
Putting out fires
left and right,

16:06.933 --> 16:09.001
wording to the wise.

16:09.035 --> 16:11.570
You wanna man-pound?

16:11.605 --> 16:14.407
Action!

16:26.755 --> 16:28.056
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

16:29.558 --> 16:30.859
Garfunkel!

16:30.893 --> 16:33.661
You got three seconds
to release her!

16:33.696 --> 16:37.065
One...

16:40.569 --> 16:42.270
You gotta be out of your mind.

16:42.304 --> 16:44.672
Killing bad guys
is my business,

16:44.707 --> 16:46.641
and business be
fuckin' crackin', yo!

16:46.675 --> 16:49.210
- Thank you, officer.
- You're welcome...

16:49.245 --> 16:50.245
Bitch!

16:50.279 --> 16:51.947
Uh, it's fine.

16:56.352 --> 16:57.853
Officer?

16:57.887 --> 16:59.355
Get the fuck out of here,
streetwalker.

16:59.389 --> 17:01.691
We working here.

17:03.728 --> 17:06.663
Thank you.

17:06.696 --> 17:07.964
It was really good, yeah.

17:07.999 --> 17:10.935
Still rolling!

17:10.969 --> 17:13.436
I'm not...

17:13.471 --> 17:16.140
That was one
fine-ass hostage, yo.

17:16.174 --> 17:20.010
She's a real heartbreaker,
all right.

17:20.044 --> 17:21.345
Seriously...

17:21.378 --> 17:23.046
No, I-I...

17:23.080 --> 17:24.681
Yo, what the fuck, man?

17:24.714 --> 17:26.782
Yo, I gotta bring down
the fucking apocalypse

17:26.817 --> 17:28.284
on these motherfuckers, right?

17:28.318 --> 17:30.252
Cut!

17:30.287 --> 17:31.454
Reset!

17:31.488 --> 17:33.055
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:33.090 --> 17:34.790
You think
you can fucking disrespect me

17:34.825 --> 17:36.125
in front of my cast and crew,

17:36.160 --> 17:37.727
and don't get your
fucking ass killed, nigga?

17:37.761 --> 17:39.528
I wasn't mocking you, Sam,
I swear!

17:39.563 --> 17:40.863
Yeah, well, you're over here
flirting and laughing

17:40.898 --> 17:42.966
while I'm trying to work,
motherfucker!

17:43.000 --> 17:44.534
You know what, you two
motherfuckers belong together--

17:44.568 --> 17:45.869
two unfaithful bitches!

17:45.904 --> 17:47.638
You little snotty
Hollywood motherfucker!

17:47.672 --> 17:49.340
I give you the chance
of a lifetime.

17:49.374 --> 17:50.841
What the fuck you do with it?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:50.875 --> 17:53.977
Don't worry, Tyler.
It's a fake gun.

17:54.012 --> 17:55.912
Biscuit.

17:55.947 --> 17:57.414
- Whoa!
- Shit!

17:57.448 --> 17:58.648
You got any more bright ideas?

17:58.682 --> 17:59.749
For a guy with
a gun to his throat,

17:59.783 --> 18:01.917
you're pretty fucking funny.

18:01.952 --> 18:03.786
Look, look, look, Sam,
if you're gonna shoot him,

18:03.820 --> 18:05.187
you're gonna have
to shoot me first.

18:05.221 --> 18:07.556
Moody, my brother, mind
your business right now, man.

18:07.590 --> 18:11.659
As much as it pains me
to admit it, Sam,

18:11.694 --> 18:13.261
I hooked up with Kali too.

18:13.296 --> 18:15.230
Get the fuck out of here, man.
You bullshittin', man.

18:15.265 --> 18:16.899
You my fucking boy.
You wouldn't do that, man.

18:16.933 --> 18:18.334
I am!

18:18.368 --> 18:19.969
But I did.
I didn't mean to.

18:20.003 --> 18:23.072
W-we met on the flight to L.A.,
and we smooched a little,

18:23.107 --> 18:25.842
and then I didn't think
I'd ever see her again.

18:25.877 --> 18:28.111
But t-there she was
at your place,

18:28.146 --> 18:30.047
looking fine as wine.

18:30.081 --> 18:32.016
Is this true, bitch?

18:32.050 --> 18:33.784
Yeah.

18:33.819 --> 18:37.021
So what--a little smooch
on the plane, man?

18:37.055 --> 18:39.523
- I can live with that.
- Yeah, well...

18:39.558 --> 18:41.192
What?

18:41.226 --> 18:43.027
You know,
once you kiss somebody,

18:43.061 --> 18:45.196
it's hard not to want
to do it again, right?

18:45.231 --> 18:47.031
So--so we did...

18:47.066 --> 18:49.200
And then some.

18:50.603 --> 18:55.473
God damn it,
the truth just sounds better.

18:56.842 --> 18:58.610
Kali, is this fucking true?

18:58.644 --> 19:02.214
Calvin, I never meant
to hurt you.

19:02.248 --> 19:04.316
So y'all been fucking
all along, right?

19:04.350 --> 19:05.651
No, just twice.

19:05.685 --> 19:06.885
- Twice, right?
- Yeah, just twice.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.287
Yeah, just the twice.

19:08.321 --> 19:11.323
Yeah, but both times
I accused y'all of fucking,

19:11.357 --> 19:12.991
you actually had been fucking!

19:13.026 --> 19:17.496
Yeah, it turns out you've got
quite the nose for sex, Sam.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.798
This is fucked up, man.

19:18.832 --> 19:21.834
You breaking
my fucking heart, man...

19:21.868 --> 19:24.337
Both of y'all.

19:24.371 --> 19:27.673
I can't believe this shit, man.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.708
Move, nigga.

19:31.878 --> 19:33.245
Whoa!

19:33.279 --> 19:36.015
What the fuck y'all
looking at, huh?

19:36.049 --> 19:37.683
What, you gonna fucking
videotape my shit

19:37.717 --> 19:39.185
and put it on YouTube?

19:39.220 --> 19:41.020
You wanna see
a fucking show motherfuckers?

19:41.055 --> 19:42.421
I'll show you a show!

19:45.525 --> 19:47.660
No!

19:50.730 --> 19:53.699
Charlie!

19:53.733 --> 19:55.768
Oh, shit.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.636
- Oh!
- It's getting dark.

19:57.671 --> 19:59.205
It's getting dark.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.474
Oh--oh,
that's much better.

20:01.508 --> 20:02.875
Thank you.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.845
Oh, God, I'm knockin'
on heaven's door here.

20:05.879 --> 20:08.014
Runkle, you okay?

20:08.048 --> 20:09.682
I didn't mean
to shoot you, man.

20:09.717 --> 20:11.384
I can't believe you shot at me.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.752
My head's all fucked up, man.

20:12.786 --> 20:15.221
Pussy do that
to a motherfucker.

20:15.255 --> 20:18.324
No more love no more, man--
just ass and grass.

20:18.358 --> 20:20.593
That's the spirit.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.563
Hey, Stu,
I think you should shut

20:23.597 --> 20:25.398
this motherfucker down, man,
and do a whole rewrite.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.699
I don't want to be contributing

20:26.733 --> 20:29.068
to the violence
in society no more.

20:30.337 --> 20:32.405
I think that
is a brilliant idea, Sam,

20:32.439 --> 20:34.006
but the studio--

20:34.041 --> 20:36.909
I don't think they're gonna want
to risk making you unlikable.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.412
Oh!

20:40.446 --> 20:42.447
Marcy, what the fuck?

20:42.481 --> 20:45.583
God damn it, Stu!
I know about the blowie!

20:45.617 --> 20:48.085
It was two, actually.
It was two.

20:48.119 --> 20:51.254
And you're gonna be hearing
from my attorney, motherfucker!

20:51.288 --> 20:53.857
Marcy, no! I was just making
memories, Marcy.

20:53.891 --> 20:55.158
Fuck you, Stu!

20:55.192 --> 20:57.861
I am so sorry!
I love you so much!

20:57.895 --> 20:59.195
- So much!
- Suck on this!

20:59.230 --> 21:01.598
So much, baby!

21:01.633 --> 21:05.702
I can't believe you'd
actually shoot somebody for me.

21:05.736 --> 21:07.704
That's one of the single
most romantic things

21:07.738 --> 21:09.271
anyone's ever done for me.

21:09.306 --> 21:10.673
What can I say, mama?

21:10.707 --> 21:13.376
You bring all that
shit out of me.

21:13.410 --> 21:14.377
Mm.

So are we good, Hank?

21:29.894 --> 21:31.261
- Are we good?
- Are we good?

21:31.295 --> 21:33.396
You just took a bullet for me.
Of course we're good.

21:33.431 --> 21:35.198
I told you I would,
Hank, didn't I?

21:35.233 --> 21:36.633
I told you
I'd take a bullet for you.

21:36.667 --> 21:38.468
You sure did,
and I love you for it,

21:38.502 --> 21:40.136
you stupid,
bald son of a bitch.

21:40.171 --> 21:41.738
I love you too, Hank.

21:41.772 --> 21:43.906
I love you,
and I love little Stuart.

21:43.941 --> 21:45.541
You tell him I love him, right?

21:45.575 --> 21:47.676
You tell him I tried
to be a good daddy, okay?

21:47.710 --> 21:49.077
No, no, you tell him yourself.

21:49.112 --> 21:51.180
You're going to be
a-okay, buddy boy.

21:51.214 --> 21:54.150
You're gonna live to humiliate
yourself another day.

21:54.184 --> 21:56.285
How about Lizzie?
Does she seem worried about me?

21:56.320 --> 21:57.887
Lizzie?

21:57.921 --> 22:00.223
Yes, already know that.

22:00.258 --> 22:02.492
Oh, yeah, yeah,
she looks pretty upset.

22:02.527 --> 22:04.528
That's nice, Hank.

22:04.563 --> 22:06.164
That's nice.

22:06.198 --> 22:08.700
- Hey, you got this?
- Yeah, I got this.

22:08.734 --> 22:10.202
Hey.

22:10.236 --> 22:12.137
What the fuck
were you thinking?

22:12.172 --> 22:13.872
You're jumping
in front of bullets?

22:13.906 --> 22:16.608
That little mutant needs
a father more than ever now.

22:16.642 --> 22:18.443
- Ow!
- Are you okay?

22:18.478 --> 22:20.445
Are you okay?

22:20.480 --> 22:22.514
Hey, you better not be calling
to cancel on me.

22:22.549 --> 22:23.682
You wish.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.384
No, I just--
you better bring some wine,

22:26.419 --> 22:29.388
'cause it's kind of
a-a dry household right now.

22:29.422 --> 22:30.789
Uh, will do.

22:30.823 --> 22:32.924
Yeah, I asked Stu to hook me up
with a bottle of the good stuff,

22:32.959 --> 22:34.526
but then Marcy had to go
and pistol-whip him.

22:34.560 --> 22:35.994
What?

22:36.028 --> 22:37.895
It's a long story.
I'll tell you over dinner.

22:37.930 --> 22:39.430
Okay,
I'm looking forward to it.

22:39.464 --> 22:40.531
Oh, oh, oh, a-and wait.

22:40.566 --> 22:42.433
Becca thinks
she's getting married.

22:42.468 --> 22:44.302
Okay, now I am gonna hang up.

22:44.336 --> 22:46.004
No, no, wait.
No, don't, don't, don't.

22:46.038 --> 22:47.204
Uh, just--

22:47.239 --> 22:49.406
Come on, tell me you love me,
just one time.

22:49.441 --> 22:51.442
Tell me.

22:53.878 --> 22:56.679
Just come home.

22:56.714 --> 22:59.015
Okay, I will. I just got
to swing by Charlie's first.

22:59.049 --> 23:01.183
Maybe I'll steal
a bottle of Manischewitz.

23:28.179 --> 23:30.981
- I saw that!
- Ah! Jesus fuck!

23:31.015 --> 23:32.849
No, it's just little old me.

23:32.883 --> 23:35.084
Carrie, what the fuck
are you doing here?

23:35.119 --> 23:36.419
I wanted to see you.

23:36.453 --> 23:38.353
I felt bad about the way
we left things.

23:38.388 --> 23:40.022
I said some
pretty harsh shit that night.

23:40.056 --> 23:41.957
Well, you know what?
A lot of it was true.

23:41.991 --> 23:45.026
You were right.
I-I-I deserved it.

23:45.061 --> 23:47.229
Well, thank you
for saying that.

23:47.263 --> 23:48.730
And maybe it was.

23:48.764 --> 23:51.366
And maybe you did,
but I still missed you.

23:56.372 --> 23:58.307
I lost my job.

23:58.341 --> 24:01.310
Oh, well,
I'm--I'm sorry to hear that.

24:01.344 --> 24:04.013
Yeah, I came out here
looking for another one--

24:04.048 --> 24:06.015
had a bunch
of shitty interviews

24:06.050 --> 24:08.852
and, um, thought
I'd look you up.

24:08.886 --> 24:11.021
Hey, can I ask you something?

24:11.056 --> 24:13.724
Yeah, but then
I got to go, okay?

24:13.758 --> 24:15.559
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:19.897 --> 24:22.865
Did you ever love me, Hank?

24:22.899 --> 24:26.034
Be honest.

24:26.069 --> 24:29.871
No.

24:29.905 --> 24:33.040
You just liked fucking me?

24:33.075 --> 24:35.743
I did like fucking you
very much, yes.

24:35.778 --> 24:38.847
I did.

24:38.882 --> 24:40.215
Well...

24:40.250 --> 24:41.617
Then lets fuck...

24:41.651 --> 24:42.918
- No.
- One more time.

24:42.953 --> 24:44.587
- No, no, no more times, okay?
- One more, come on.

24:44.621 --> 24:47.557
I'm sorry.
I can't. I'm sorry.

24:51.596 --> 24:54.498
What does she have
that I don't have?

24:54.533 --> 24:57.834
I don't--I don't know.
She...

24:57.869 --> 25:01.338
She's just my everything.

25:01.373 --> 25:04.742
C-c-can we not do this, please?

25:04.776 --> 25:06.344
It must be so nice.

25:06.378 --> 25:09.014
It must be so nice
to be loved like that.

25:09.048 --> 25:10.682
But okay, no, no.

25:10.716 --> 25:12.850
No more fucking.

25:12.885 --> 25:14.819
One drink, though...

25:14.853 --> 25:15.887
Please?

25:15.922 --> 25:17.122
And I'll be on my way.
I promise.

25:17.156 --> 25:18.490
- Just one drink, all right.
- Just one drink!

25:18.525 --> 25:20.559
- All right.
- Okay.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.109
Okay, right.

25:36.143 --> 25:37.877
Okay.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.048
There, one drink.
You happy?

25:44.918 --> 25:48.187
I'm the furthest
from happy I've ever been.

25:48.222 --> 25:49.889
I'm--I'm sorry, Carrie.
I just--

25:49.923 --> 25:51.657
I-I can't help you.

25:51.692 --> 25:52.759
No, you can--

25:52.793 --> 25:54.593
No, you can help me, Hank.
You can help me.

25:54.628 --> 25:56.996
You just--
you know, you're not going to.

25:57.030 --> 25:58.164
And not being loved--

25:58.198 --> 26:00.333
never, never, ever
being loved...

26:00.367 --> 26:02.668
That just really
takes a toll on a wo--

26:02.703 --> 26:04.503
Hey, whoa.

26:04.538 --> 26:06.004
- You all right?
- Yeah.

26:06.038 --> 26:08.006
- I think it's the pills.
- What pills?

26:08.041 --> 26:09.641
I probably
shouldn't be drinking.

26:09.675 --> 26:11.175
What pills?

26:11.210 --> 26:13.178
Oh, I, uh--I started
taking these antidepressants,

26:13.212 --> 26:14.746
um, a few months ago.

26:14.780 --> 26:15.780
Hey!

26:15.815 --> 26:18.349
I know!
It was after you dumped me!

26:18.384 --> 26:20.051
I mean, you know,
I had to do something.

26:20.085 --> 26:21.686
I set your apartment on fire.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.687
How fucking bonkers was that?

26:23.722 --> 26:26.023
How--how many of these
did you take?

26:26.057 --> 26:27.491
I don't know--a bunch.

26:27.525 --> 26:28.525
Okay, okay.

26:28.559 --> 26:30.026
They usually
make me feel better.

26:30.061 --> 26:31.728
- I shouldn't mix them with booze.
- I'm--I'm calling 911.

26:31.762 --> 26:34.231
No, no, no, no, that's silly.
Don't do that--stop it.

26:34.265 --> 26:36.300
Carrie, look, I need you to be
honest with me right now.

26:36.334 --> 26:37.868
How many of those pills
did you take?

26:37.902 --> 26:40.437
- How many?
- No more than you did.

26:40.471 --> 26:43.039
What do you mean?

26:43.073 --> 26:46.911
Hank, how are you feeling...

26:47.031 --> 26:48.624
right about now?

26:50.933 --> 26:52.918
What did--
what did you do?

26:53.038 --> 26:54.556
Carrie?

26:54.941 --> 26:55.869
Carrie.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.892
Hey, just think...

26:58.012 --> 26:59.728
When they find us...

26:59.848 --> 27:02.093
it'll look like to the world

27:02.127 --> 27:04.663
that we were
meant to be together.

27:04.697 --> 27:06.999
What did you do?

27:07.033 --> 27:09.001
Only what you made me.

27:12.067 --> 27:14.406
Tell me you love me.

27:17.775 --> 27:20.845
Tell me you love me.

28:04.793 --> 28:07.559
Tell me you love me.

28:08.498 --> 28:10.828
I love you.
