OF ALL THE BONEHEADED STUNTS
YOU'VE PULLED IN YOUR LIFE,

00:53.350 --> 00:55.318
THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT
THE DUMBEST.

00:55.350 --> 00:57.318
SHAWN, WHAT IN THE NAME
OF EVERYTHING THAT'S HOLY

00:57.350 --> 00:59.079
WOULD POSSESS YOU
TO DO SOMETHING

00:59.120 --> 01:00.712
SO INCREDIBLY STUPID?

01:00.760 --> 01:03.388
ALL THE KIDS FROM MY CLASS
WANTED TO SEE ME DO IT.

01:03.430 --> 01:06.228

01:19.810 --> 01:22.199
THEY CAME OUT HERE TO SEE YOU
CRACK YOUR HEAD OPEN.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.342
WHICH BASICALLY MAKES YOU
NO DIFFERENT

01:23.380 --> 01:26.508

SHOOT MILK OUT OF HIS EYE.

01:26.550 --> 01:28.848
DO YOU THINK I COULD BE
AS POPULAR AS HIM?

01:39.260 --> 01:40.591
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS, SHAWN.

01:40.630 --> 01:42.427
APPARENTLY YOU'RE UNAWARE
THAT SOME CHURROS

01:42.470 --> 01:44.563

05:15.680 --> 05:16.840
WE IGNORE THE TINY VOICE
IN OUR HEAD

05:16.880 --> 05:18.438
THAT TELLS US
NOT TO DO STUFF.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.811
THE TINY VOICE
IN MY HEAD SAYS

05:19.850 --> 05:21.818
THERE'S A REASON
I'M THE ONLY BLACK PERSON HERE.

05:21.850 --> 05:24.819

05:40.970 --> 05:42.506
SO THEY'RE BOUND
TO TRY AGAIN.

05:42.540 --> 05:43.939
HOW THE HELL ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT SOMEONE

HE IS IN DANGER.

06:08.760 --> 06:09.863
AND I SENSE FOUL PLAY.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.891

HAVE TO TRUST ME.

YOU LEFI' OUT
THE DAREDEVIL PART.

06:31.220 --> 06:32.448
AND THAT'S WHY HE KNOWS

06:32.490 --> 06:33.855
THE STUNT
WAS TAM PERED WITH.

06:33.890 --> 06:35.812
A PSYCHIC, HUH?

06:35.860 --> 06:36.952
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING,

06:36.990 --> 06:38.878
BUT YOU MIGHT BE
ON TO SOMETHING.

06:38.930 --> 06:41.558
MY DAD'S LAST TWO STUNTS
DIDN'T GO OFF RIGHT EITHER.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.421
AND I HAVE BEEN NOTICING
SOME WEIRD THINGS LATELY.

06:44.470 --> 06:45.528

LAST MONTH
WE SHARED THE BILL

07:03.820 --> 07:04.946
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO DUTCH THE CLUTCH IS?

07:04.990 --> 07:06.855
HE'S BEEN HICCUPPING
FOR NINE YEARS, SHAWN.

07:06.890 --> 07:08.687
IT'S A CANINE RECORD.
GUYS, PLEASE.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.950
LOOK, NO OFFENSE,
BUT MY DAD'S NOT GONNA LET

07:10.990 --> 07:12.924
SOME PSYCHIC GUY
HANG AROUND HIM.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.895
HIS CIRCLE'S AIR-TIGHT.

07:15.930 --> 07:19.229

07:38.890 --> 07:39.959
MM!

07:39.990 --> 07:41.855

TO THE BATHROOM

07:41.890 --> 07:43.858
AND DIDN'T COME BACK.

07:43.890 --> 07:46.825
SO EITHER IT WENT BADLY,
OR SHE'S STILL IN THE BATHROOM.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.794
OH, CARLTON, I'M SORRY.

07:48.830 --> 07:49.967

07:52.540 --> 07:55.566

07:55.600 --> 07:57.033
WHAT?
THAT IS A FUNNY STORY.

07:57.070 --> 07:58.139
CLOWNS ARE FUNNY.

07:58.170 --> 08:01.003
STORIES ABOUT THEM BEING
SHOT TO DEATH, NOT SO MUCH.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.132
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T DRAW

08:02.180 --> 08:03.807
A DIAGRAM
OF THE BULLET HOLES.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.670
WELL, THERE WERE CRAYONS
ON THE TABLE.

08:05.710 --> 08:06.847
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

08:06.880 --> 08:09.940

AN AGENT IN THE VALLEY?

08:19.960 --> 08:21.996
THIS IS DUTCH THE CLUTCH.
WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?

08:22.030 --> 08:24.567

FOR LESS THAN TWO GRAND.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.794
3,500.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.058
3,500, THAT'S IT.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.692
WOW.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.708
YOU KNOW,
THE ALLMAN BROTHERS

08:30.740 --> 08:32.708
GENERALLY TEND TO INHIBIT
MY PSYCHIC POWERS,

08:32.740 --> 08:33.968
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL ME.

08:34.010 --> 08:34.931
IS THERE ANYONE
THAT'D LIKE TO SEE

08:34.980 --> 08:36.800
YOUR DAD BITE THE BULLET?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.738
JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY

08:40.650 --> 08:41.947
AGAINST MY DAD?
YEAH.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.244
NO WAY.
EVERYBODY HERE LOVES HIM.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.713
CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE
WOULD WANT TO HURT HIM.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.011
IN FACT, I'VE BEEN TRYING

08:48.060 --> 08:49.015
TO GET HIM TO RETIRE
ALTOGETHER.

08:49.060 --> 08:50.982
WHY DOESN'T HE LISTEN?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.759
GIVE UP THE SPOTLIGHT?

08:52.800 --> 08:53.926
GIVE UP THE APPLAUSE,
THE LOVE?

08:53.960 --> 08:54.858
NEVER.

08:54.900 --> 08:58.927
BESIDES, WELL, MY DAD THINKS
HE'S UNKILLABLE.

08:58.970 --> 09:02.030
BUT HE'S WRONG.
HE'S FLESH AND BLOOD.

09:02.070 --> 09:03.332
MY FLESH AND BLOOD.

09:03.370 --> 09:04.268
THAT'S WHY
I'M COUNTING ON YOU BOYS.

09:04.310 --> 09:07.837
OKAY, LET ME--LET ME
INTRODUCE YOU TO MY DAD.

DO WE HAVE
OUR COVER STORIES YET?

09:09.010 --> 09:10.307
DON'T WORRY, I TAKE CARE

09:10.350 --> 09:12.045
OF ALL THE FINANCES
AND HIRINGS.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.810
POP, FOUND US THE TWO
NEW DIEHARDS YOU ASKED FOR.

09:14.850 --> 09:16.044
DAMN, ALREADY?

09:16.080 --> 09:18.844
ACTUALLY, I'M DIE-HARD.
HE'S DIE-HARDER.

09:18.890 --> 09:19.982
WE HAVE TWO OTHER GUYS
IN OUR CREW,

09:20.020 --> 09:21.282
BUT THEY AREN'T NEARLY
AS GOOD AS US.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.686
WELL, HOW THE HELL
YOU DO THAT SO QUICK?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.152
ESPECIALLY AFI'ER WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT LAST BUNCH?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.329
EXCUSE ME, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE LAST BUNCH?

09:27.360 --> 09:29.157
WELL, WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT
FOR LEGAL REASONS.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.861
ALL I KNOW IS
OUR ATTORNEY SAID

09:30.900 --> 09:31.798
THAT IT AIN'T
DECAPITATION

09:31.830 --> 09:35.095
IF THE HEAD
DON'T COME OFF ALL THE WAY.

09:35.140 --> 09:37.165
[laughter]

09:37.210 --> 09:40.077
I JOKE, I JOKE!

09:40.110 --> 09:41.668
HE BE'I'I'ER BE.
THAT'S MORBID!

09:41.710 --> 09:45.146
HI, I'M VIKI,
DUTCH'S WIFE.

09:45.180 --> 09:47.978
NOW YOU BOYS HAVE
EXPERIENCE, RIGHT?

09:48.020 --> 09:50.079
IT'S UP TO YOU
TO KEEP MY MAN SAFE.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.008
THAT'S RIGHT.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.950
HEY, WHAT'S THE MOST
DANGEROUS THING YOU BOYS DONE?

09:53.990 --> 09:57.778
WE EAT AT TACO JOHN'S
WITH SOME FREQUENCY,

09:57.830 --> 10:00.151
SO THAT PUTS US
RIGHT THERE ON THE EDGE.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.668
OH, WE GOT OURSELVES
A COUPLE OF COMEDIANS.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.692
I LIKE THAT!
OKAY, YOU BOYS GOT THE JOB--

10:05.730 --> 10:07.789
OH, DAMN!

10:07.840 --> 10:09.660
DID YOU JUST BREAK
YOUR WRIST?

10:09.710 --> 10:10.859
YEAH, WELL, IT'S OKAY.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.161
NOTHING BUSTED
THROUGH THE SKIN.

10:12.210 --> 10:13.234
DAD, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE A BREAK.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.872
I MEAN, YOU ALMOST
GOT KILLED TODAY.

10:14.910 --> 10:16.002
OH, COME ON, SON,

10:16.040 --> 10:17.177
YOU JUST WORRY
ABOUT YOUR OWN SAFETY.

10:17.210 --> 10:18.973
I'LL BE FINE.

10:19.010 --> 10:20.773
WELL, MAYBE LOUIS IS RIGHT.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.141
AND WE CAN FINALLY TAKE
THAT VACATION.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.317
TO DOLLYWOOD!
OH...

10:25.350 --> 10:27.056
UH, NOT TO OVERSTEP,
BUT I THINK

10:27.090 --> 10:28.785
YOU MAY STILL HAVE
A CONCUSSION FROM EARLIER.

10:28.820 --> 10:30.754
CONCUSSION?

10:30.790 --> 10:33.350
HELL, I'VE HAD A CONCUSSION
SINCE 1982.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.992
TRUE STORY.

10:35.030 --> 10:37.191
ANYBODY ELSE'S BEER
TASTE LIKE METAL?

10:37.230 --> 10:40.131
[laughs]

10:40.170 --> 10:42.434
(TV announcer)
SUNDAY, DON'T MISS EL DIABLO.

10:42.470 --> 10:45.064
WHO THE HELL
PUT THAT ON THERE?!

10:45.110 --> 10:46.338
OKAY, DID WE
MISS SOMETHING?

10:46.370 --> 10:48.179
HELL, THAT'S EL DIABLO.

10:48.210 --> 10:50.201
WHAT IS AN EL DIABLO?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.241
HE'S NOBODY.
JUST SOME WANNABE DAREDEVIL.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.315
NO ONE KNOWS WHO HE IS

10:53.350 --> 10:54.374
BECAUSE HE ALWAYS WEARS
A MASK.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.172
RIGHT THERE!
SEE THAT RIGHT THERE?

10:56.220 --> 10:58.245
THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T TAKE
NO DAMN VACATION.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.757
THAT SON OF A BITCH
IS RIGHT ON MY HEELS.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.212
RELAX, DAD.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.887
HE'S AMATEUR HOUR
COMPARED TO YOU.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.728
DUTCH, FORGET
ABOUT EL DIABLO.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.149
I GOT YOU THAT CANYON JUMP
IN SEPTEMBER.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.929
ROCK ON, MANNY!
OW!

11:09.970 --> 11:10.925
I TOLD YOU, CLUTCH.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.392
EXPLOSIONS, CRASH ES.

11:12.430 --> 11:13.897
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
PAY TO SEE.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.135
YOU KEEP THAT UP,
I'M GONNA GET YOU ON TV.

11:16.170 --> 11:17.706
AND IT WON'T BE
THAT INFOMERCIAL

11:17.740 --> 11:18.900
FOR THE HOME
STOMACH PUMP.

11:18.940 --> 11:20.202
THIS IS GONNA BE
ONE OF THOSE

11:20.240 --> 11:21.377
RAIN DELAY
FILLER SHOWS.

11:21.410 --> 11:23.241
DAD, PLEASE.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.770
IT'S TOO SOON
TO BE ADDING NEW STUNTS.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.402
OH, BULL PISS,
AIN'T NOBODY TELLING ME

11:26.450 --> 11:28.145
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
NO MORE.

11:28.180 --> 11:30.740
I THINK THAT WAS THE WORST
ENGLISH I'VE EVER HEARD.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.189
ALL RIGHT!

11:32.220 --> 11:34.211
$200 THAT I'M GONNA TAKE
A FALL!

11:34.260 --> 11:37.149
300!
350i

11:37.190 --> 11:39.158
400!
450!

11:39.190 --> 11:41.021
550!

11:41.060 --> 11:42.789
650!
HERE I GO.

11:42.830 --> 11:46.732
WHEE!

11:46.770 --> 11:48.738
UNH!

11:48.770 --> 11:51.967
[laughing]
GLEN CAMPBELL ROCKS!

11:53.180 --> 11:56.206
OH, DAMN.
I SPILLED MY BEER.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.800
IT MIGHT BE HARDER

11:58.850 --> 12:00.340
TO KEEP THIS GUY ALIVE
THAN I THOUGHT.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.184
YOU NEED ME, CHIEF?

12:06.220 --> 12:08.188
WHY IS SOMEONE
LODGING A COMPLAINT

12:08.220 --> 12:10.256
AGAINST MY HEAD DETECTIVE?

12:10.290 --> 12:11.257
THAT'S THE THIRD ONE
THIS MONTH.

12:11.290 --> 12:13.429
HE'S JUST GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH RIGHT NOW.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.098
HE'LL BE FINE.

12:15.130 --> 12:17.166
I THINK HE'S HAVING
SOME SERIOUS DATING PROBLEMS.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.464
OH.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.536
YOU KNOW, WHEN I USED
TO WORK VICE,

12:21.570 --> 12:22.901
MY PARTNER WAS
AN ALCOHOLIC.

12:22.940 --> 12:25.158
AND ONE NIGHT I WENT
OVER TO HIS HOUSE,

12:25.210 --> 12:28.134
HANDCUFFED HIM TO A RADIATOR,
AND MADE HIM DRY OUT.

12:28.180 --> 12:30.444
AND WHEN HE FINALLY
SOBERED UP,

12:30.480 --> 12:32.175
I GAVE HIM A CHOICE.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.775
OR CHEW YOUR HAND OFF
FOR FREEDOM."

12:35.820 --> 12:39.039
HE CHOSE THE PROGRAM.

12:39.090 --> 12:41.809
IS THAT A REAL STORY?

12:41.860 --> 12:44.954
MAYBE IT IS, MAYBE I SAW IT
ON AN OLD POLICE WOMAN RERUN.

12:44.990 --> 12:46.548
THE POINT IS, O'HARA,

12:46.590 --> 12:48.990
SOMETIMES IT'S UP
TO THE COP'S PARTNER

12:49.030 --> 12:51.225
TO KEEP THEIR HEAD
ABOVE WATER, HUH?

12:51.270 --> 12:53.295
TO DO WHAT'S NECESSARY
TO MAKE SURE

12:53.340 --> 12:54.432
THAT THEY STAY ON COURSE.

12:54.470 --> 12:55.960
GET ME?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.434
YES, CHIEF.

13:01.980 --> 13:04.198
HMM, THIS IS FOR YOU.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.070
WHAT'S WRONG?

13:06.110 --> 13:09.011
CHIEF JUST GAVE ME
SOME REALLY WEIRD ADVICE.

13:09.050 --> 13:10.847
WELL, WHAT DOES SHE WANT?

13:10.890 --> 13:13.415
WELL, I CAN'T
BE SURE, BUT...

13:13.460 --> 13:16.213
I THINK SHE WANTS ME
TO FIND LASSITER A GIRLFRIEND.

13:16.260 --> 13:19.821
OH.

13:19.860 --> 13:22.556
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.522
THAT MAKES SENSE.

13:24.570 --> 13:27.232
I GUESS.
THANKS, LOUIS.

13:27.270 --> 13:30.103
SO DUTCH DOESN'T
HAVE A WILL

13:30.140 --> 13:31.300
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
INVINCIBLE PEOPLE

13:31.340 --> 13:32.329
DO NOT NEED THEM.

13:32.370 --> 13:34.474
HMM.

13:34.510 --> 13:35.909
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.305
THOSE ARE FORMS
THAT MUST BE FILLED OUT

13:38.550 --> 13:40.245
JUST SIGN THEM.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.612
THESE "RELEASE THE EMPLOYER
FROM ANY LIABILITY

13:42.650 --> 13:46.017
IN CASE THE STUNT TESTER
IS...TORN TO SHREDS?"

13:46.050 --> 13:48.086
STUNT TESTER?
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.212
ARE YOU CRAZY?

13:49.260 --> 13:51.182
TRUST ME, AND BE COOL.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.288
WAIT, THIS ONE IS IN CASE

13:52.330 --> 13:53.422
WE'RE ACCIDENTALLY
CHEWED TO DEATH

13:53.460 --> 13:55.291
BY A MALFUNCTIONING ROBOT?

13:55.330 --> 13:57.867
OH, HELL NO!
RELAX, WE'LL BE FINE.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.539
DEBONED.
KILLED AND RE-KILLED.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.197
HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK?

14:02.240 --> 14:04.367
GUS, DON'T BE AN OLD SPONGE
WITH HAIR HANGING OFF IT.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.638
I'M ALL OVER THIS CASE.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.228
"MIMED TO DEATH."

14:07.280 --> 14:08.474
THAT'S CLEARLY A TYPO.
THEY MEANT "MAIMED."

14:08.510 --> 14:10.307
WHAT, ARE WE GONNA BE KILLED
BY MARCEL MARCEAU?

14:10.350 --> 14:11.908
MARCEL MARCEAU IS DEAD.

14:11.950 --> 14:13.269
SEE, THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.617
WE ARE SOLVING
THIS CASE, SHAWN,

14:14.650 --> 14:16.174
BEFORE WE HAVE TO DO
ANY OF THIS STUFF.

14:16.220 --> 14:17.949
FAIR.

14:17.990 --> 14:19.878
I'VE BEEN CHECKING OUT
THIS EL DIABLO GUY.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.217
HE ALWAYS ROLLS INTO TOWN

14:21.260 --> 14:22.511
THE DAY AFI'ER DUTCH.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.549
AND THEY'VE BEEN COMPETING

14:23.590 --> 14:25.148
FOR THE SAME GIGS
FOR ALMOST A YEAR.

14:25.190 --> 14:28.398
INCLUDING THAT CANYON JUMP
THAT DUTCH JUST GOT.

14:28.430 --> 14:29.294
ALL RIGHT, MOTIVE.

14:29.330 --> 14:32.026
WIPE OUT DUTCH
AND THE FIELD IS CLEAR.

14:32.070 --> 14:34.197
AND EL DIABLO IS
A DAREDEVIL,

14:34.240 --> 14:35.468
SO HE WOULD KNOW
HOW TO SABOTAGE THE STUNTS

14:35.500 --> 14:37.263
TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.299
I'LL BUY THAT.

14:38.340 --> 14:39.409
AND SOMEONE
AT THE PARTY TOLD ME

14:39.440 --> 14:40.976
THAT EL DIABLO PERFORMED
AT THE FAIR

14:41.010 --> 14:42.238
THE NIGHT BEFORE DUTCH.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.406
WHEN DUTCH'S TEAM
WAS NO DOUBT

14:43.450 --> 14:45.202
PREPPING FOR THEIR STUNT.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.649
YOU'RE SAYING THEY HAD ACCESS
TO DUTCH'S EQUIPMENT.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.545
I'M SOLD.
HE'S OUR GUY.

14:48.580 --> 14:50.047
SO WHERE IS HE?

14:50.090 --> 14:52.513
WHERE DO WE FIND
THIS EL DIABLO?

14:52.550 --> 14:53.687
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT CHECKING OUT

14:53.720 --> 14:56.359
SOME OLD
ANTIQUE MOTORCYCLES?

14:56.390 --> 14:58.654
THEY CALL THIS
A MOTORCYCLE SHOW?

14:58.690 --> 15:00.920
THERE'S, LIKE,
FOUR MOTORCYCLES HERE.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.689
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE
THE BIKE FROM BLUE THUNDER.

15:02.730 --> 15:04.994
THAT WAS A HELICOPTER.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.134
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WAS THINKING OF BLUE LAGOON.

15:07.170 --> 15:08.990
THERE WASN'T A BIKE
IN BLUE LAGOON.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.632
HOW'D THEY GET OFF
THE ISLAND, GUS?

15:10.670 --> 15:13.935
[scoffs]

15:13.980 --> 15:17.177
YO, EL DIABLO!
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

15:17.210 --> 15:18.347
SHAWN SPENCER.

15:18.380 --> 15:19.369
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
SQUIRTS MACINTOSH.

15:19.410 --> 15:20.411
JUST HAVE
A COUPLE SORT OF

15:20.450 --> 15:22.475
SERIOUS QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.612
ON, NO, NO, NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GET ON THE BIKE.

15:23.650 --> 15:25.447
[engine starts]

15:27.390 --> 15:28.618
DUDE, HE'S RUNNING.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.979
INTERNATIONAL SIGN OF GUILT.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.989
LET'S GO, QUICK.

15:34.030 --> 15:34.997
GET IN THE SIDECAR.

15:35.030 --> 15:36.327
ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND?

15:36.360 --> 15:37.998
I'M NOT GETTING
IN THAT THING.

15:38.030 --> 15:39.224
YOU GET IN THERE.
GUS, YOU HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

15:39.270 --> 15:40.294
HOW TO DRIVE
A MOTORCYCLE.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.466
GET IN THE SIDECAR.

15:46.410 --> 15:47.434
DUDE, IT'S LIKE
HIGH ROAD TO CHINA.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.606
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:48.640 --> 15:50.642
WE'RE GOING, WE'RE GOING.

15:53.550 --> 15:55.142
[coughs]

15:56.520 --> 15:57.987
OH!
HEY!

16:03.160 --> 16:04.388
HEY!
OH!

16:04.430 --> 16:06.421
JEEZ!

17:02.720 --> 17:05.109
LOUIS?

17:05.150 --> 17:15.196
YOU'RE EL DIABLO?

17:15.200 --> 17:23.266
YOU'RE EL DIABLO?

17:23.310 --> 17:24.607
LOUIS?!

17:24.640 --> 17:26.835
THAT IS THE SEXIEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

17:26.870 --> 17:29.236
SHUT UP, SHAWN.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.805
YOU'RE GUILTY
OF ATTEMPTED PATRICIDE.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.670
AND YOU TRIED TO KILL
YOUR OWN DAD.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.642
I NEVER TRIED
TO KILL ANYONE.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.386
YOU REALLY THINK
I'D HIRE DETECT IVES

17:37.420 --> 17:38.739
IF I WANTED TO BUMP OFF
MY OWN DAD?

17:38.790 --> 17:40.280
WHAT KIND OF PSYCHIC
ARE YOU?

17:40.320 --> 17:41.787
THE KIND THAT
LOVES BEES

17:41.820 --> 17:43.458
AND HISTORICAL NOVELS.

17:43.490 --> 17:45.128
THE KIND THAT KNOWS A LIE
WHEN HE HEARS ONE.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.492
AND KNOWS THAT ONLY
THE GUILTY MAKE A RUN FOR IT.

17:47.530 --> 17:49.851
THE ONLY THING
I AM GUILTY OF

17:49.900 --> 17:51.663
IS NOT TELLING MY DAD
THAT I DO THIS TOO.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.737
AND I RAN BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
YOU TWO EXPOSING MY SECRET.

17:54.770 --> 17:56.328
WHY HIDE IT?

17:56.370 --> 17:57.860
MY DAD FORBID ME
FROM BEING A DAREDEVIL

17:57.910 --> 17:59.707
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT ME
TO GET HURT.

17:59.740 --> 18:00.707
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE YOUR FATHER

18:00.740 --> 18:04.278
TELL YOU NOT TO FOLLOW
IN HIS FOOTSTEPS?

18:04.310 --> 18:05.607
[exhales]
I WISH.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.744
I DID THIS BECAUSE I CARE
ABOUT MY DAD.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.816
AS SOON AS EL DIABLO
STARTS MAKING SOME NOISE

18:10.850 --> 18:12.886
AND HE KNOWS I'M LEGIT,
THEN I'LL TELL HIM.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.184
THEN MAYBE HE'LL LET ME
TAKE OVER THE FAMILY BUSINESS

18:15.220 --> 18:16.448
AND FINALLY RETIRE.

18:16.490 --> 18:18.822
HOPEFULLY BEFORE
HE GETS REALLY HURT.

18:20.860 --> 18:24.466
WHOA!
PSYCHIC VISION INCOMING!

18:24.500 --> 18:27.833
I SEE COLORS ON YOUR HANDS,
ON YOUR BIKE.

18:27.870 --> 18:29.292
ON YOUR HANDS.

18:29.340 --> 18:32.832
MY DAUGHTER, MY SISTER,
MY FATHER THE HERO.

18:32.870 --> 18:34.701
YEAH, I REPAINTED
MY BIKE RECENTLY.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.628
I HAD PAINT ON MY HANDS.
REPAINTED WHY?

18:36.680 --> 18:38.477
BECAUSE YOU STOLE IT
FROM YOUR DAD?

18:38.510 --> 18:40.478
I BORROWED IT.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.272
DAD WAS SUPPOSED TO USE THIS
IN THE LAST JUMP.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.141
BUT MANNY GOT US A SPONSOR
AND A NEW BIKE.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.317
TECH SPECS SAID
THE NEW BIKE WAS WAY SAFER.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.782
LEFT THIS ONE FOR ME.

18:48.820 --> 18:49.889
WHO THE HELL IS MANNY?

18:49.920 --> 18:51.524
THE AGENT.
OH.

18:51.560 --> 18:52.879
LOOK, YOU GUYS AREN'T GONNA
TELL HIM WHO I AM, RIGHT?

18:52.930 --> 18:54.295
HMM.

18:54.330 --> 18:56.491
IT'S A SENSITIVE SUBJECT.

18:56.530 --> 18:58.293
HE WON'T UNDERSTAND IT
RIGHT AWAY.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.890
I JUST WANT HIM
TO COME TO GRIPS WITH...

19:00.940 --> 19:03.158
THIS IS WHAT I AM.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.735
I DIDN'T CHOOSE IT.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.738
YEAH.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.442
I HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE
WITH MY DAD

19:10.480 --> 19:12.209
WHEN I TOLD HIM I...

19:12.250 --> 19:14.309
WANTED TO TAKE GUS HERE
TO THE PROM.

19:14.350 --> 19:15.647
[Shawn chuckles]

19:17.820 --> 19:19.640
COME ON, YOU AND ME
AT THE PROM?

19:19.690 --> 19:21.510
[laughin
NO? g]

19:21.560 --> 19:23.881
MISFIRE?
OKAY.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.490
SO THE EXPLODING MOTORCYCLE

19:26.530 --> 19:27.849
WAS PROVIDED
AT THE LAST MINUTE

19:27.900 --> 19:29.424
BY DUTCH'S AGENT MANNY.

19:29.460 --> 19:30.529
WHO PROBABLY SLAPPED

19:30.570 --> 19:32.492
THOSE SPONSOR DECALS
ON HIMSELF.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.293
I'D SAY THAT WARRANTS
INVESTIGATION.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.568
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.465
WHY WOULD AN AGENT
RISK HIS CLIENT'S LIFE?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.932
ISN'T THAT
HIS MONEY TRAIN?

19:38.970 --> 19:40.403
REMEMBER THE AFTER PARTY?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.931
I TOLD YOU, CLUTCH,
EXPLOSIONS, CRASHES.

19:42.980 --> 19:44.538
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
PAY TO SEE.

19:44.580 --> 19:47.469
MANNY MAY NOT BE TRYING
TO KILL DUTCH...

19:47.520 --> 19:48.839
BUT HE'S MAKING
THE STUNTS MORE DANGEROUS

19:48.880 --> 19:50.939
TO ADD A LITTLE PIZZAZZ
TO DUTCH'S ACT.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.878
WHICH IN TURN
GETS DUTCH MORE GIGS.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.956
WHICH IN TURN IS ONLY
INCREASING MANNY'S 10%.

19:54.990 --> 19:56.719
WHICH IN TURN
MAKES ME WONDER

19:56.760 --> 19:58.853
WHY YOU WOULD USE
THE WORD PIZZAZZ.

20:06.370 --> 20:07.837
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:07.870 --> 20:09.929
I'LL GIVE YOU AN A-PLUS
FOR THE SKULKING,

20:09.970 --> 20:11.961
BUT A C-MINUS
FOR THE LEERING.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.831
I HAVE TO FIND LASSITER
A DATE FOR THE WEEKEND.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.303
I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO THREE
PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATES.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.009
JULES, WHY WOULD YOU
POSSIBLY WANT

20:18.050 --> 20:19.472
TO JUMP
INTO THAT SNAKE PIT?

20:19.510 --> 20:21.011
VICK ORDERED ME TO.

20:21.050 --> 20:21.971
ALL RIGHT.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.442
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GIVE
YOUR CANDIDATES

20:23.490 --> 20:24.445
THE PSYCHIC ONCE OVER?

20:24.490 --> 20:26.811
IF YOU HAVE TO.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.351
I'M SENSING IT'LL BE EASIER

20:28.390 --> 20:29.857
TO GET A STRANGER
TO GO OUT WITH HIM

20:29.890 --> 20:31.323
THAN SOMEONE HE WORKS WITH.
OR KNOWS HIM.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.327
OR HAS EVER HAD
A CONVERSATION WITH HIM.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.327
OR HE HASN'T SHOT.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.190
ONE MORE QUESTION.

20:34.230 --> 20:35.652
ARE WE LOCKED
INTO THE SAME SPECIES?

20:35.700 --> 20:37.998
ENOUGH ALREADY.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

20:38.030 --> 20:39.827
WE NEED A BACKGROUND CHECK
ON MANNY ROBERTSON.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.337
OH, I KNOW THAT NAME.

20:41.370 --> 20:43.304
YEAH, WE'VE HAD HIM
IN HERE A FEW TIMES

20:43.340 --> 20:44.466
ON SOME
GET-RICH-QUICK SCAMS.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.307
WHY HIM?

20:46.340 --> 20:48.331
I'M GETTING A VERY STRONG VIBE
OFF HIM

20:48.380 --> 20:51.349
ON THIS AWESOME DAREDEVILS
CASE WE'RE WORKING.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.847
[laughing]
DAREDEVILS, REALLY?

20:52.880 --> 20:54.017
THEY'RE STILL AROUND?

20:54.050 --> 20:55.813
DON'T...DON'T DO THAT.

20:55.850 --> 20:57.340
DON'T HATE ON THE DEVILS.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.779
I JUST--I-I NEVER
GOT IT PERSONALLY.

20:59.820 --> 21:02.550
I MEAN, "OOH, I CAN JUMP
OVER A FLAMING TRASHCAN."

21:02.590 --> 21:04.319
I MEAN,
WHY DO PEOPLE CARE?

21:04.360 --> 21:05.850
ALLOW ME.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.895
WHAT IS HE DOING?
WAIT FOR IT.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.365
[inhales]

21:18.410 --> 21:21.402
WAIT FOR IT.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.502
[yelling]
WHAT'S UP?

21:24.550 --> 21:25.949
[cheers and applause]

21:25.980 --> 21:28.073
(crowd
GUS! GUS! )GUS!

21:28.120 --> 21:31.089
[dramatic music]

21:31.120 --> 21:39.323
*

21:51.410 --> 21:52.331
OOH, OW.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.438
I'M OKAY, I'M OKAY,
I'M OKAY.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.347
NEED ANY MORE PROOF?
NO, I GOT IT.

21:58.380 --> 22:01.372
I'M FINE.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.589
WE NEED TO FIND MANNY
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

22:04.620 --> 22:06.941
WE SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE
BREATHING ROOM, ACTUALLY.

22:06.990 --> 22:08.389
IF MANNY'S OUR MAD SABOTEUR,

22:08.420 --> 22:10.354
HE WON'T STRIKE
UNTIL HE HAS AN AUDIENCE.

22:10.390 --> 22:11.652
DURING THE ACTUAL STUNT,
NOT DURING REHEARSAL.

22:11.690 --> 22:12.987
EXACTLY.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.062
NEXT STUNT'S TOMORROW.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.898
A JUMP, CLOSING NIGHT
OF THE FAIR.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.862
DUTCH SHOULD BE SAFE
TILL THEN.

22:22.900 --> 22:25.437
CLUTCH!

22:25.470 --> 22:29.873
[metal clatters,
glass shatters]

22:29.910 --> 22:31.446
OR NOT.

22:31.480 --> 22:35.541
[coughing]

22:35.580 --> 22:37.138
HOLY.

22:37.180 --> 22:38.442
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

22:38.490 --> 22:39.946
HUH?!

22:39.990 --> 22:41.457
[shouting]
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

22:41.490 --> 22:42.479
SHOULD WE CALL THE COPS
OR THE AMBULANCE?

22:42.520 --> 22:43.589
WHAT THE HELL FOR?

22:43.630 --> 22:44.858
I'VE DONE THAT STUNT
A THOUSAND TIMES.

22:44.890 --> 22:46.448
THAT WAS
JUST A REHEARSAL.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.119
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.469
COME ON, I GOT YOU SET UP
OVER AT THE STADIUM.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.530
(Shawn)
YOU KNOW, DUTCH,

22:58.570 --> 23:00.970
SEEING AS HOW GUS AND I
ARE JUST GETTING STARTED,

23:01.010 --> 23:03.444
A COUPLE QUESTIONS
ABOUT REPRESENTATION.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.505
NAMELY, YOUR AGENT MANNY.

23:05.550 --> 23:06.574
FIRST WE REHEARSE.

23:06.610 --> 23:09.613
THEN I GOTTA STRIP VIKI DOWN
AND OIL HER JOINTS.

23:09.650 --> 23:12.118
WOW, NOT TOO SHY
ABOUT YOUR WIFE, ARE YOU?

23:12.150 --> 23:13.515
I'M TALKING ABOUT MY BIKES.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.413
I NAME 'EM ALL
AFTER MY WIFE.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.610
MAYBE WE COULD JUST TALK
TO MANNY HIMSELF.

23:16.660 --> 23:18.059
WHEREABOUTS IS HE?

23:18.090 --> 23:19.125
I'LL CALL HIM LATER.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.958
AFTER I GIVE VIKI
A LUBE JOB AND PULL HER NUTS.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.422
HEY, GUYS, COME ON!

23:23.470 --> 23:25.620
WE GOTTA GET READY
FOR THAT CATAPULT STUNT!

23:25.670 --> 23:27.831
YOU BOYS READY TO WORK?

23:27.870 --> 23:30.566
STRIP AND PUT THESE ON.

23:34.010 --> 23:35.739
ALL RIGHT,
THIS ONE'S EASY.

23:35.780 --> 23:38.169
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS STAND HERE.

23:39.580 --> 23:41.070
HOW THE HELL
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HELP DUTCH

23:41.120 --> 23:42.075
WHEN WE'RE STUCK DOING
THIS STUFF?

23:42.120 --> 23:43.439
AS LONG
AS WE'RE MAKING SURE

23:43.490 --> 23:44.889
THE STUNTS ARE SAFE,
HE CAN'T GET KILLED.

23:44.920 --> 23:45.989
I'LL MAKE IT
SAFE FOR ME OUTSIDE.

23:46.020 --> 23:47.180
YOU NEED TO MAN UP.

23:47.220 --> 23:48.209
I'D PUT THESE MASKS ON
IF I WAS YOU.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.750
WHAT FOR?

23:49.790 --> 23:51.189
WHAT IS THIS, AN UNDERWATER
STUNT OR SOMETHING?

23:51.230 --> 23:54.154
WAIT, IS THAT GASOLINE?

23:54.200 --> 23:57.727
[both screaming]

23:57.770 --> 23:59.192
YOU MUST BE OUT
OF YOUR DAMN MIND!

23:59.230 --> 24:00.697
WELL, WE HAD TO SEE

24:00.740 --> 24:02.059
HOW FIRE RETARDANT
THESE SUITS WERE.

24:02.100 --> 24:03.135
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT

24:03.170 --> 24:04.660
BEFORE YOU TRIED
TO SET US ON FIRE?

24:04.710 --> 24:06.063
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GETTING PAID FOR?

24:06.110 --> 24:07.134
[horn honks]

24:07.170 --> 24:10.037
DUTCH, DUTCH!
GREAT NEWS, BABY.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.240
APPARENTLY SOME CRAZY FAN

24:11.280 --> 24:12.838
RAN EL DIABLO

24:12.880 --> 24:14.575
OFF THE ROAD
AT THE CLASSIC BIKE SHOW

24:14.620 --> 24:15.973
AND HE INJURED
HIS SHOULDER.

24:16.020 --> 24:17.009
HE CAN'T DO THE CLOCK TOWER
DEATH DROP STUNT

24:17.050 --> 24:18.540
AND I GOT IT FOR YOU.

24:18.590 --> 24:21.058
ROCK ON, MANNY!
OW!

24:21.090 --> 24:22.489
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO RIG THESE TWO UP

24:22.520 --> 24:23.851
AND DROP 'EM OFF
THE BUILDING FIRST.

24:23.890 --> 24:26.484
NO, NO, NO TIME TO REHEARSE.
THANK YOU, LORD.

24:26.530 --> 24:27.326
THE TIME OF THE EVENT
WAS ALREADY ADVERTISED.

24:27.360 --> 24:28.327
IF WE WANT IT,
WE GOTTA DO IT NOW.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.499
YOU UP FOR IT, DUTCH?
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

24:30.530 --> 24:33.260
HELL, ONE TIME I BUNGEE JUMPED
OFF A BUILDING

24:33.300 --> 24:34.631
TWICE AS HIGH
AS THAT TOWER.

24:34.670 --> 24:36.558
AND EVEN THOUGH
THE BUNGEE CORD SNAPPED

24:36.600 --> 24:37.828
ON THE WAY DOWN,
I STILL MADE IT

24:37.870 --> 24:39.531
TO THE GEORGE THOROGOOD
CONCERT THAT NIGHT.

24:39.570 --> 24:41.276
TRUE STORY.
YEE-HAW!

24:41.310 --> 24:42.971
YES, SIR!

24:43.010 --> 24:45.149
WE'RE GONNA MAKE
SOME MONEY, DUTCH.

24:45.180 --> 24:46.943
[laughter]

24:46.980 --> 24:49.210
NO REHEARSAL?
THAT'S CONVENIENT.

24:49.250 --> 24:51.548
MANNY'S RUSHING DUTCH
INTO ANOTHER STUNT UNPREPARED.

24:51.590 --> 24:53.046
ANOTHER STUNT.

24:53.090 --> 24:55.479
ANOTHER CHANCE
FOR SABOTAGE.

24:57.090 --> 24:59.650
WHAT IS GOING ON?

24:59.690 --> 25:00.918
APPARENTLY DUTCH IS GOING
TO JUMP FROM THE BUILDING,

25:00.960 --> 25:02.120
SPREAD HIS ARMS,

25:02.160 --> 25:04.594
AND GLIDE DOWN
TO THAT LARGE PILLOW

25:04.630 --> 25:08.634
ALL LIVE ON CAMERA
FOR SOME DAREDEVIL WEB SITE.

25:08.670 --> 25:10.297

25:10.340 --> 25:14.879

DUTCH! DUTCH!
DUTCH! DUTCH!

25:14.910 --> 25:17.037
YOU SEE THAT?
YES.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.843
NOW I'M IN THE MOOD
FOR SOME COFFEE.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.110
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:21.150 --> 25:23.641
COFFEE, SHAWN.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.089
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?
THE SAME THING
YOU'RE LOOKING AT.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.781
IT'S A DUNKIN' DONUTS
PATCH, GUS.

25:26.820 --> 25:28.014
AND THEY HAVE
EXCELLENT COFFEE.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.858
THEY HAVE ONE

25:30.890 --> 25:33.279
YOU KNOW WHAT, DUDE?
YOU ASTOUND ME.

25:33.330 --> 25:35.218
AND NOW I MUST HAVE
A BLUEBERRY CRUMB.

25:35.260 --> 25:37.091
IT'S TOTALLY TRIGGERED
MY DONUT LAUNCH SEQUENCE.

25:37.130 --> 25:39.564
WILL YOU FOCUS, SHAWN?
I CAN'T.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.931
[mouthing silently]

25:49.180 --> 25:51.648

25:56.120 --> 25:57.781

GOT YOU.

HOW ABOUT
MIND-BLOWING GENIUS?

26:28.750 --> 26:31.310
DUTCH, PLEASE.

26:31.350 --> 26:32.715
SPREAD YOUR ARMS
THE WAY YOU WOULD

26:32.750 --> 26:33.682
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE STUNT.

26:33.720 --> 26:36.848
I DON'T TAKE ORDERS
FROM NIMRODS LIKE YOU.

26:36.890 --> 26:39.324
DUTCH...DO IT.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.624
DO IT!

26:47.070 --> 26:49.163
[fabric rips]

26:53.340 --> 27:00.075
IF YOU WOULD'VE JUMPED,
YOU WOULD'VE DIED.

27:00.110 --> 27:01.179
(Dutch)
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF STUNT

27:01.220 --> 27:02.710
WAS THAT YOU TRIED
TO PULL OUT THERE?

27:02.750 --> 27:04.411
NOBODY STEALS
MY SPOTLIGHT, NOBODY!

27:04.450 --> 27:06.338
YOU'RE JUST DAMN LUCKY
MANNY PULLED ME OFF THAT ROOF

27:06.390 --> 27:07.755
BEFORE I GOT A CHANCE
TO THROW YOU OFF IT!

27:07.790 --> 27:10.156
DUTCH, I'M GONNA LEVEL
WITH YOU.

27:10.190 --> 27:11.919
WE'RE NOT REALLY
PROFESSIONAL STUNTM EN.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.894
NOW THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
ALL THE SCREAMING.

27:13.930 --> 27:15.659
SO WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

27:15.700 --> 27:18.669
UH, WE'RE, UM, UH--

27:18.700 --> 27:20.361
ANIMAL ACT IVISTS.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.697
RIGHT.
AND THAT IS THE TRUTH.

27:21.740 --> 27:22.866
WE ARE HERE TO STOP YOU

27:22.900 --> 27:24.106
FROM ABUSING ANY MORE

27:24.140 --> 27:27.439
LARGE. . .IMPRESSIVE EXOTIC GAME
IN YOUR ACT.

27:27.470 --> 27:29.836
SHAME ON YOU,
DUTCH THE CLUTCH.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.438
I AIN'T GOT NO ANIMALS
IN MY ACT!

27:31.480 --> 27:33.675
HUH!

27:33.720 --> 27:35.244
WELL, THAT SETTLES THAT.
YEAH.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.713
GUS AND I WILL BE GOING.
YEAH.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.741
(Dutch)
SIT DOWN!

27:38.790 --> 27:39.984
NOW THE NEXT THING
THAT COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH

27:40.020 --> 27:41.180
BETTER BE THE TRUTH.

27:41.220 --> 27:42.778
OTHERWISE WE'RE GONNA
START REHEARSING

27:42.820 --> 27:44.082
THAT BURY YOU ALIVE
STUNT.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.052
WE'RE DETECT IVES.
HE'S A PSYCHIC.

27:46.090 --> 27:47.079
WE WERE HIRED
BY YOUR SON.

27:47.130 --> 27:48.392
DAD, I CAN EXPLAIN.

27:48.430 --> 27:49.727
I'M A CHRISTIAN MAN!

27:49.760 --> 27:50.863
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO

27:50.900 --> 27:51.867
GETTING ME ALL MIXED UP

27:51.900 --> 27:52.992
IN THAT VOODOO
DARK FORCE STUFF?

27:53.030 --> 27:54.964
HE--

27:55.000 --> 27:56.092
WE THINK THAT SOMEONE
IS TRYING

27:56.140 --> 27:57.391
TO SABOTAGE YOUR STUNTS.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.101
LET'S JUST
HEAR 'EM OUT.

27:59.140 --> 28:00.778
HAVE YOU GUYS
FOUND ANYTHING?

28:00.810 --> 28:02.072
YES, WE THINK
THAT IT'S--

28:02.110 --> 28:05.807
WE'RE NOT SURE
WHO IT IS YET EXACTLY.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.772
THAT'S BECAUSE NOBODY'S
TRYING TO KILL ME.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.139
NEWS FLASH.

28:09.180 --> 28:10.215
ALMOST DYING'S
PAR FOR THE COURSE

28:10.250 --> 28:11.740
FOR MY LINE OF WORK.

28:11.790 --> 28:14.759
DUTCH, SOMEONE TAMPERED
WITH THAT GLIDING SUIT.

28:14.790 --> 28:16.280
THE SPIRITS
ARE SURE OF IT.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.323
THAT GLIDING SUIT TORE
BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT

28:19.360 --> 28:22.488
DURING THE GLIDING SUIT BOOM
IN 1977.

28:22.530 --> 28:24.088
AND THAT FALL
WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED ME!

28:24.130 --> 28:25.461
DAMN, ONE TIME
I JUMPED OUT A BLIMP

28:25.500 --> 28:26.967
500 FEET IN THE SKY.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.729
HAD A HEART ATTACK
ON THE WAY DOWN.

28:28.770 --> 28:30.806
TWO HOURS LATER,
I WAS EATING A BLT

28:30.840 --> 28:32.262
IN A RED ROBIN.

28:32.310 --> 28:36.178
TRUE STORY!

28:36.210 --> 28:38.906
DUTCH,
PLEASE LISTEN TO US.

28:38.950 --> 28:40.440
NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME,

28:40.480 --> 28:41.947
BECAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA
SAY IT ONE TIME.

28:41.980 --> 28:43.174
YOU'RE FIRED!

28:43.220 --> 28:45.142
RED, HELP THESE BOYS OUT.

28:45.190 --> 28:47.283
WAIT A SECOND--
WHOA, RED--

28:50.290 --> 28:52.986
HUH, SO WE'RE NOT
GONNA SHOOT GUS

28:53.030 --> 28:54.258
OUT OF A CANNON LATER?

28:54.300 --> 28:56.052
NO? OKAY, OKAY.
WHOA.

28:59.330 --> 29:01.764
[door slams]

29:09.140 --> 29:10.129
[camera shutter clicks]

29:11.310 --> 29:13.505
THERE'S SOMETHING I LOVE
ABOUT TH ESE LOW-RENT STAKEOUTS.

29:13.550 --> 29:15.211
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS SNAP SOME PICTURES

29:15.250 --> 29:16.444
OF A GUY WITH SOME
STOLEN MERCHANDISE.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.381
WHY DIDN'T YOU WEAR
THE BURGUNDY TURTLENECK?

29:19.420 --> 29:22.309
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME
TO CHANGE FOR A STAKEOUT.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.123
WHY?
NO REASON.

29:24.160 --> 29:27.459
I JUST--I REALLY LIKE YOU
IN THAT BURGUNDY TURTLENECK.

29:27.490 --> 29:29.151
AND WITH SHORT HAIR.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.394
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

29:30.430 --> 29:31.522
A LITTLE COLOGNE
WOULDN'T KILL YOU.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.367
ALL RIGHT, YOU THINK I DON'T
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

29:33.400 --> 29:36.836
LOOK, I'VE NOTICED
YOU'RE KIND OF...

29:36.870 --> 29:38.462
CHECKING ME OUT
AT THE SQUAD

29:38.510 --> 29:40.000
AND ASKING
ABOUT MY DATING HABITS.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.076
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
IT'S JUST--

29:42.110 --> 29:45.807
LISTEN, IT IS
PERFECT LY NORMAL

29:45.850 --> 29:49.069
FOR A JUNIOR OFFICER
TO DEVELOP...FEELINGS

29:49.120 --> 29:50.371
FOR HER SUPERIOR.

29:50.420 --> 29:52.285
SOMEONE SHE FEELS
IS A MENTOR AND--

29:52.320 --> 29:53.480
OH, NO!

29:53.520 --> 29:56.910
[laughing]
NO, NO!
OH, MY GOD, NO.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.518
O'HARA, IT'S OKAY.

29:58.560 --> 30:01.449
NO, NO, VICK ORDERED ME
TO FIND YOU A GIRLFRIEND.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.469
WHAT?
YEAH.

30:04.500 --> 30:07.424
YOU KNOW, WE'VE NOTICED
THAT YOU'VE BEEN ON EDGE LATELY,

30:07.470 --> 30:09.131
AND THOUGHT
IT MIGHT HELP.

30:09.170 --> 30:11.001
AND I HAVE THIS FRIEND
YOU CAN MEET LATER

30:11.040 --> 30:12.200
WHO LIKES COPS.

30:12.240 --> 30:15.038
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.968
THAT'S A TOTAL INVASION
OF MY PRIVACY.

30:17.010 --> 30:18.409
NOT TO MENTION
UNPROFESSIONAL.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.338
HMM.

30:20.380 --> 30:22.940
SO WHAT?
I SLEEP ALONE.

30:22.980 --> 30:25.540
SO WHAT IF I SAW
A FROZEN DINNER IN HALF

30:25.590 --> 30:27.285
BEFORE I MICROWAVE IT
EVERY NIGHT?

30:27.320 --> 30:28.309
SO WHAT IF
I SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED

30:28.360 --> 30:30.351
PLANTING EVIDENCE
ON MY WIFE'S NEW BOYFRIEND?

30:30.390 --> 30:34.099
I MEAN, THAT'S--
I COULD--JUST--

30:34.130 --> 30:35.859
OH, GOD,
I MAY NEED YOUR HELP.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.494
THAT'S ALL
I WANT TO DO.

30:38.530 --> 30:40.418
OH, DAMN, I'M NOT GETTING
A SIGNAL.

30:40.470 --> 30:42.028
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
GO FIND A HOT SPOT.

30:42.070 --> 30:43.094
AND THEN WHEN I GET BACK,

30:43.140 --> 30:44.903
I'LL TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT MY FRIEND.

30:44.940 --> 30:47.408
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL THEM ABOUT MANNY?

30:47.440 --> 30:48.532
BECAUSE IT'S NOT HIM.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.502
WHEN MANNY WAS ADJUSTING
DUTCH'S SUIT

30:50.540 --> 30:53.543
BEFORE THE STUNT, HE WHISPERED
SOMETHING IN HIS EAR.

30:53.580 --> 30:58.142
I, OF COURSE,
READ HIS LIPS.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.545
HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT HIM
WEARING THAT GLIDING SUIT.

31:00.590 --> 31:01.659
HE WANTED HIM TO WEAR
THE BLACK ONE

31:01.690 --> 31:03.385
BECAUSE IT WAS
FAR MORE SLIMMING.

31:03.420 --> 31:05.354
HMM.
AND THEN HE SAID...

31:05.390 --> 31:07.529
"PURPLE CAMEL
LAWNMOWER MAN."

31:07.560 --> 31:09.050
HOW THE HELL ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO HELP DUTCH

31:09.100 --> 31:10.419
NOW THAT WE'VE
BEEN BANISHED?

31:10.460 --> 31:12.018
MM-MM-HMM.

31:12.070 --> 31:15.494
I'M GONNA GO OVER THERE
AND START WORKING ON IT.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.064
YOU'RE WASTING ENERGY,
SHAWN.

31:17.100 --> 31:18.931
DO YOU SEE SOLAR PANELS
UP IN HERE?

31:23.440 --> 31:24.600
COME ON NOW,
YOU GUYS GOTTA HURRY.

31:24.650 --> 31:25.776
NEXT STUNT
IS COMING UP FAST.

31:25.810 --> 31:27.949
DAD'LL KILL ME IF HE FINDS OUT
I LET YOU BACK IN HERE.

31:27.980 --> 31:29.117
DON'T WORRY, LOUIS.

31:29.150 --> 31:31.209
WE'LL BE AS NONEXISTENT
AS AN ALDO NOVA FAN.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.324
SO WHAT ARE WE
LOOKING FOR?

31:38.360 --> 31:39.622
RED.

31:39.660 --> 31:40.991
WHEN HE GAVE US
THE HEAVE-HO,

31:41.030 --> 31:42.588
I SAW AN OLD TATTOO
ON HIS ARM.

31:42.630 --> 31:44.598
FIRST FOUR LETTERS
SPELLED "VIKI,"

31:44.630 --> 31:46.427
BUT IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FONT
FROM THE REST.

31:46.470 --> 31:48.461
SO?

31:48.500 --> 31:50.138
SO HE WAS
PROBABLY SEEING HER

31:50.170 --> 31:51.660
BEFORE SHE MARRIED DUTCH,
RIGHT?

31:51.710 --> 31:53.109
SHE LEAVES HIM.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.175
HE GETS A DIFFERENT
TATTOO ARTIST

31:54.210 --> 31:55.302
TO ADD THE "N-G-S"

31:55.340 --> 31:57.228
TO CONCEAL IT
FROM HIS BOSS.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.508
MAYBE RED'S TRYING
TO ELIMINATE THE COMPETITION.

31:58.550 --> 31:59.676
BINGO.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.184
[whispering]
OH, OH!

32:17.530 --> 32:21.660
LET ME GO FIRST.
I'M MORE STEALTHY.

32:21.700 --> 32:23.031
I'M AS GRACEFUL
AS A GAZELLE, SHAWN.

32:23.070 --> 32:25.300
YOU ARE NOT.
A JACKAL.

32:25.340 --> 32:28.275
DUDE, A JACKAL
IS NOT GRACEFUL.

32:28.310 --> 32:30.232
IT'S LIKE A RABID,
VICIOUS BADGER.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.372
SHH!

32:40.450 --> 32:42.088
NOW WHAT IS THAT?

32:45.530 --> 32:46.554
THIS IS IT.

32:46.590 --> 32:47.557
I BET YOU THAT'S A BOMB,

32:47.590 --> 32:48.557
AND HE'S GONNA PUT IT

32:48.600 --> 32:50.955
ON ONE OF THE BIKES.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.665
HMM.

33:05.710 --> 33:08.019
COME ON, RED.
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

33:10.450 --> 33:12.338
WHAT THE HECK?

33:16.420 --> 33:19.355
DUDE, WHY WOULD
SOMEONE TAKE...

33:19.390 --> 33:21.699
"GEMACETABINE"
OR "CAPSITONABINE?"

33:21.730 --> 33:24.267
WOW, YOU WERE NOWHERE CLOSE
ON THE PRONUNCIATION.

33:24.300 --> 33:25.597
WHAT ARE THEY FOR?
THOSE TWO TOGETHER?

33:25.630 --> 33:27.291
YOU PROBABLY GOT
PANCREATIC CANCER.

33:27.330 --> 33:28.729
PROGNOSIS?

33:28.770 --> 33:31.603
NOT GOOD.
IT'S PRETTY TERMINAL.

33:31.640 --> 33:38.478
HE'S DYING.

33:38.510 --> 33:39.602
SO RED'S NOT THE BAD GUY.

33:39.650 --> 33:41.117
HE WOULDN'T SMUGGLE IN DRUGS
TO HELP DUTCH

33:41.150 --> 33:42.117
AND THEN TURN AROUND
AND KILL HIM.

33:42.150 --> 33:43.378
THIS CASE IS BIZARRE.

33:43.420 --> 33:45.149
WHY KILL SOMEONE
IF HE'S ALREADY DYING?

33:45.190 --> 33:47.511
THAT BEGS THE QUESTION,
WHO KNOWS HE'S DYING?

33:47.550 --> 33:49.552
WE DON'T COME UP WITH SOMETHING
SOON, HE'S A GONER.

33:49.590 --> 33:51.251
WE NEED TO KNOW WHO STANDS
TO GAIN FROM DUTCH'S DEATH.

33:51.290 --> 33:52.359
AND FOR THAT,
WE NEED HIS WILL.

33:52.390 --> 33:55.120
BUT LOUIS SAID
THERE WAS NO WILL.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.219
HE DOESN'T KNOW
HIS DAD'S DYING, GUS.

33:57.260 --> 33:59.262
IF YOU WERE DYING OF CANCER,
WOULDN'T YOU HAVE A WILL?

33:59.300 --> 34:00.119
ARE YOU KIDDING?

34:00.170 --> 34:01.068
I'VE HAD MY ESTATE PLANNER
ON SPEED DIAL

34:01.100 --> 34:03.136
EVER SINCE WE STARTED
THIS STUPID BUSINESS.

34:03.170 --> 34:04.137
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES

34:04.170 --> 34:06.104
I'VE HAD A GUN SHOVED
IN MY FACE BECAUSE OF YOU?

34:06.140 --> 34:07.300
TH REE?

34:07.340 --> 34:10.173
WRONG ANSWER.

34:15.720 --> 34:18.382
WE'RE NEVER GONNA FIND IT.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.557
[exhales]

34:25.130 --> 34:27.257
WAIT A MINUTE.

34:27.290 --> 34:29.599
THERE'S SOMETHING WEIRD
WITH THIS TILE.

34:29.630 --> 34:30.654
LOOKS FINE TO ME.

34:30.700 --> 34:32.691
NO, NO, NO.
THE PATTERN'S OFF.

34:32.730 --> 34:33.697
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

34:33.730 --> 34:35.288
LIKE SOMEONE PRIED ONE UP

34:35.340 --> 34:37.296
AND PUT IT DOWN WRONG.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.137
OW!

34:42.180 --> 34:43.374
BINGO.

34:43.410 --> 34:45.401
IS THAT HIS WILL?

34:50.180 --> 34:52.512
IT'S JUST AS GOOD.
LIFE INSURANCE POLICY.

34:52.550 --> 34:54.279
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

34:54.320 --> 34:57.357
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

34:57.390 --> 34:58.789
DUDE, SERIOUSLY,
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.684
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS MEANS.

35:00.730 --> 35:03.255
YOU NEVER COULD
UNDERSTAND LEGALESE.
OH, REALLY?

35:03.300 --> 35:05.188
REMIND ME WHO IT WAS
THAT SET UP OUR PSYCH 401K?

35:05.230 --> 35:07.198
OH, YOU MEAN OUR 601Ks?

35:07.230 --> 35:09.266
BECAUSE INDIA
DOESN'T HAVE 401Ks.

35:09.300 --> 35:10.790
IT'S A GROWTH ECONOMY, GUS.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.660
WE'VE ALREADY MADE,
LIKE, 500 RUPEE.

35:12.710 --> 35:14.177
THAT'S $13.

35:14.210 --> 35:15.768
MAN, JUST TELL ME
WHAT I NEED TO KNOW.

35:15.810 --> 35:18.176
SHH--DO I RUSH YOU
WHEN YOU'RE DOING

35:18.210 --> 35:20.201
YOU WHOLE, "OOH, I'M SENSING
THIS, I'M SENSING THAT?"

35:20.250 --> 35:21.217
ALWAYS.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.649
AND YOU USUALLY
JAB ME IN THE RIBS

35:22.680 --> 35:23.715
WITH YOUR ELBOW.

35:23.750 --> 35:26.139
WHICH IS LIKE
A CHOCOLATE HARPOON.

35:26.190 --> 35:27.282
ARE YOU FINISHED?
MAYBE.

35:27.320 --> 35:28.685
ON FIRST READ,
IT SAYS

35:28.720 --> 35:30.278
IF DUTCH DIES
OF NATURAL CAUSES,

35:30.320 --> 35:31.548
THERE'S BARELY A PAYOUT.

35:31.590 --> 35:32.852
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE FOR SOMEONE

35:32.890 --> 35:34.653
WHO'S ALWAYS
PUTTING HIMSELF AT RISK.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.918
BUT DUTCH HAS A UNIQUE
INDEMNITY POLICY.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.461
IF HE DIES DURING
ONE OF HIS STUNTS,

35:38.500 --> 35:41.663
HIS BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE
$1.2 MILLION.

35:41.700 --> 35:44.806
WHO ARE THE BENEFICIARIES?

35:44.840 --> 35:47.832
HIS WIFE AND HIS SON.

35:47.870 --> 35:52.239
GUS...I KNOW
WHO OUR KILLER IS.

35:54.350 --> 35:56.648
(announcer on P.A.)
AND IT IS
A PACKED HOUSE HERE

35:56.680 --> 35:58.409
FOR TONIGHT'S MAIN EVENT,

35:58.450 --> 36:00.384
THE LEGENDARY
DUTCH "THE CLUTCH" JENKINS

36:00.420 --> 36:02.479
AND HIS MOST
DANGEROUS STUNT EVER.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.852
WE ARE MOMENTS AWAY
FROM SHOWTIME,

36:04.890 --> 36:06.585
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

36:06.630 --> 36:07.779
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

36:07.830 --> 36:11.459
I THOUGHT I FIRED
YOUR ASS.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.333
I JUST CAME TO APOLOGIZE
TO YOU, DUTCH.

36:14.370 --> 36:16.497
FOR WHAT?

36:16.540 --> 36:17.768
I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.337
ALL THIS TIME, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE THE KID

36:20.370 --> 36:22.338
WHO SHOT MILK
OUT OF HIS EYE.

36:22.380 --> 36:25.440
YOU KNOW, WILLING TO DO JUST
ABOUT ANYTHING FOR ATTENTION,

36:25.480 --> 36:27.368
REGARDLESS OF HOW IT EFFECTS
THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU.

36:27.410 --> 36:29.742
BUT THAT'S--THAT'S
NOT THE CASE, IS IT?

36:29.780 --> 36:30.974
SON, I'M GETTING TIRED

36:31.020 --> 36:32.817
OF THE SOUND
OF YOUR GUMS FLAPPING.

36:32.850 --> 36:36.752
YOU'RE ALL ABOUT FAMILY,
AREN'T YOU, DUTCH?

36:36.790 --> 36:38.849
YOU LOVE 'EM
MORE THAN LIFE.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.719
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN
TRYING TO KILL YOURSELF.

36:46.570 --> 36:51.963
I SENSED A DARK CLOUD
OVER YOU.

36:52.010 --> 36:55.002
YOU'RE TERMINALLY ILL.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.406
I'M SORRY, MAN.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.271
IT MUST BE
SO SCARY KNOWING

36:59.310 --> 37:00.277
THAT YOU'RE GONNA DIE,

37:00.310 --> 37:04.519
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE
ALL THAT YOUR FAMILY HAS.

37:04.550 --> 37:09.249
AND THAT'S WHY YOU TOOK OUT
THAT SPECIAL INSURANCE POLICY.

37:09.290 --> 37:12.623
THE ONE THAT
ONLY YOU KNOW ABOUT.

37:12.660 --> 37:16.448
NOW ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS MAKE SURE THAT YOU DIE

37:16.500 --> 37:17.956
IN THE MIDDLE OF A STUNT,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.423
AND YOUR FAMILY GETS
A WINDFALL.

37:20.470 --> 37:22.495
RIGHT?

37:22.540 --> 37:24.428
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN A SIMPLE
MATTER OF YOU SABOTAGING

37:24.470 --> 37:26.438
YOUR OWN STUNTS,
BUT, DUTCH,

37:26.470 --> 37:29.439
YOU'RE A VICTIM
OF YOUR OWN TALENT.

37:29.480 --> 37:32.040
YOU ACTUALLY ARE
A LITTLE UNKILLABLE.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.674
EVEN WITH ALL
YOUR FAULTY MECHANICS,

37:34.720 --> 37:36.347
YOUR INSTINCTS KICKED IN

37:36.380 --> 37:38.484
AND PREVENTED YOU
FROM FAILING.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.488
(announcer)
IT'S ALMOST SHOWTIME, FOLKS.

37:40.520 --> 37:41.987
DUTCH "THE CLUTCH" JENKINS
IS HERE

37:42.020 --> 37:44.659
TO PERFORM
A GRAVITY DEFYING SPECTACLE.

37:44.690 --> 37:47.352
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS
YOUR LAST STUNT FOR AWHILE,

37:47.390 --> 37:50.291
AND THAT'S MY FAULT.

37:50.330 --> 37:52.469
IF THIS DISEASE GETS YOU
BEFORE YOUR NEXT SHOW,

37:52.500 --> 37:53.660
YOUR FAMILY GETS NOTHING.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.634
SO I'M SURE WHATEVER
YOUR METHOD IS TONIGHT,

37:55.670 --> 37:59.367
IT'S FOOLPROOF.

37:59.410 --> 38:01.332
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

38:01.380 --> 38:03.905
NOTHING.

38:03.940 --> 38:05.999
I'M NOT GONNA TRY
AND STOP YOU.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.608
AND I WILL NOT SAY ANYTHING

38:07.650 --> 38:09.470
IF YOU GO THROUGH WITH IT.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.010
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

38:31.000 --> 38:36.028
JUST LET ME LEAVE YOU
WITH THIS, DUTCH.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.036
IT DOESN'T TAKE A PSYCHIC

38:38.080 --> 38:40.002
TO SEE HOW MUCH
PEOPLE LOVE YOU.

38:40.050 --> 38:42.974
YOUR SON CAME TO ME
AND HIRED A PSYCHIC

38:43.020 --> 38:45.045
AGAINST HIS BETTER JUDGMENT
TO KEEP YOU ALIVE.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.546
AND YOU DON'T
KNOW THIS YET,

38:46.590 --> 38:48.080
BUT ALL HE WANTS
IN THE WORLD

38:48.120 --> 38:50.111
IS TO BE MORE LIKE YOU.

38:50.160 --> 38:53.584
YOU GO TO YOUR SON,
OR YOUR WIFE,

38:53.630 --> 38:55.495
OR ANYONE ON YOUR CREW
FOR THAT MATTER,

38:55.530 --> 38:59.421
AND YOU ASK THEM
WHICH THEY'D RATHER HAVE:

38:59.470 --> 39:01.665
SIX MORE MONTHS WITH YOU

39:01.700 --> 39:03.565
OR A MILLION DOLLARS.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.669
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL
WHAT THEY'LL ANSWER,

39:07.710 --> 39:10.099
AND THEY WON'T HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT IT FOR A SECOND.

39:17.550 --> 39:18.949
IS THAT RIGHT?

39:21.660 --> 39:23.116
TRUE STORY.

39:25.460 --> 39:27.018
YOU'RE WRONG.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.160
I WAS THAT KID IN CLASS

39:35.200 --> 39:37.964
WHO SHOT MILK
OUT OF HIS EYES.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.002
AND I WAS DAMN GOOD.

39:42.140 --> 39:43.573
[engine starts]

39:50.620 --> 39:52.713
(announcer)
AND HERE HE IS NOW,

39:52.750 --> 39:57.517
DUTCH "THE CLUTCH" JENKINS!

39:57.560 --> 40:00.484
[cheers and applause]

40:00.530 --> 40:02.589
(crowd)
CLUTCH! CLUTCH!
CLUTCH! CLUTCH!

40:05.230 --> 40:08.119
CLUTCH! CLUTCH!
CLUTCH! CLUTCH!

40:08.170 --> 40:10.195
CLUTCH! CLUTCH! CLUTCH!

40:10.240 --> 40:13.459
(announcer)
AND HE'S OFF.
SPEEDING DOWN THE RAMP.

40:13.510 --> 40:15.432
HE'S PAST THE POINT
OF NO RETURN.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.539
IT'S ALL OR NOTHING.

40:21.550 --> 40:23.745
HE DID IT!
HE DID IT!

40:23.780 --> 40:25.486
A HUNDRED WAGONS.

40:25.520 --> 40:26.646
GIVE IT UP.
FANTASTIC.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.612
A VICTORY LAP AROUND THE ARENA.

40:28.660 --> 40:29.888
WHAT A NIGHT.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.979
YOU'VE WITNESSED HISTORY
HERE TONIGHT, FOLKS.

40:32.030 --> 40:40.563
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
LET'S HEAR IT...

40:40.600 --> 40:41.669
NO, REALLY?

40:41.700 --> 40:42.997
YOU--YOU GREW UP
YOUR WHOLE LIFE

40:43.040 --> 40:45.600
IN SANTA BARBARA?
YEAH.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.165
[Lassiter and woman
laughing]

40:48.210 --> 40:49.939
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT!
THAT'S AMAZING.

40:49.980 --> 40:52.608
THAT'S FASCINATING--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:52.650 --> 40:54.811
OH, I'M JUST TALKING
TO YOUR FRIEND BLAIR HERE.

40:54.850 --> 40:57.512
SHE--SHE'S GREAT.
WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON.

40:57.550 --> 40:58.744
SHE'S NOT MY FRIEND.

40:58.790 --> 40:59.984
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

41:00.020 --> 41:01.009
YOU DIDN'T SEND HER
DOWN HERE TO MEET ME?

41:01.050 --> 41:02.551
NO!

41:02.590 --> 41:05.081
I DON'T INVITE FRIENDS
TO DANGEROUS STAKEOUTS.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.859
BUT I KNOW HER.
SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.065
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE A HIT MAN.

41:12.100 --> 41:13.658
OH, CARLTON!

41:13.700 --> 41:17.158
SO ARE WE GONNA DO THIS
OR NOT?

41:19.910 --> 41:21.969
I GOTTA GO.

41:27.050 --> 41:29.746
SO I GUESS WE'RE NOT ON
