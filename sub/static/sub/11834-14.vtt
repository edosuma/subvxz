DOLE: <i>Previously</i>
<i>on "The Practice"...</i>

00:02.769 --> 00:04.538
His name is William Hinks.

00:04.571 --> 00:06.172
He's a serial
psycho head-chopper

00:06.206 --> 00:07.541
who just successfully
got acquitted.

00:07.574 --> 00:09.175
Now he's obsessed or something
with Lindsay.

00:09.209 --> 00:11.444
I just want you
to scare him.

00:11.477 --> 00:13.514
I'll take care of it,
Bobby.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.315
HINKS: Hello, Lindsay.
If you're getting this,

00:16.349 --> 00:18.318
it's at the instructions
of my probate attorney,

00:18.351 --> 00:19.820
which means I must be dead.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.388
That's unfortunate.

00:22.422 --> 00:24.324
I usually like to have
the last laugh.

00:24.357 --> 00:28.795
This is my little
insurance policy on that.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.296
Get out.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.397
-What?
-Go!

00:43.777 --> 00:45.646
-Can't go in there.
Can't go in there.
-I work there.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.380
-Get back.
-Let me through.

00:47.413 --> 00:48.582
Let me through!

00:48.615 --> 00:50.216
Look out!

00:50.250 --> 00:51.718
Lucy! Lucy!

00:51.752 --> 00:53.119
Look out.

00:53.153 --> 00:54.688
I'm going with her.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.690
WOMAN: All right, come on.
We got to get through here.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.559
-Step aside, please.
-People, get out of the way.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.193
Step aside.
Coming through.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.194
We got the get through here.
Move out of the way.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.495
Coming through.

01:05.131 --> 01:08.101
BOBBY: I'm right here.
You just stay calm.

01:08.134 --> 01:09.503
I'm right here.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.505
Can you tell me
her injuries?

01:11.538 --> 01:13.674
-MAN: Not yet.
-I'm okay.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.275
I'm right here with you.

01:15.308 --> 01:17.110
Heart stopped.
Get the paddles.

01:17.143 --> 01:19.546
Charging to 200.
Clear!

01:20.547 --> 01:21.515
Nothing.

01:21.548 --> 01:22.783
Charging to 360.

01:22.816 --> 01:23.817
Clear!

01:25.418 --> 01:26.787
Okay, she's back.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.523
She's back. Okay.

01:29.556 --> 01:32.125
20-year-old female.
B. P. is 120 over 90.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.126
Sir --

01:33.159 --> 01:34.528
I want to be with her.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.330
You can't, sir.
You have to wait here.

01:37.363 --> 01:39.800
WOMAN: What have you got?

01:39.833 --> 01:42.235
35-year-old female
in an explosion.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.337
-Went into full arrest.
-What's her blood pressure?

01:44.370 --> 01:46.139
80 over 0 response.
She's been unconscious.

01:46.172 --> 01:48.308
Sir, I'm sorry, but you cannot
go past this point.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.512
You learned
anything more?

01:51.545 --> 01:53.514
Just some... Explosion.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.815
That's all I got.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.550
Lucy was conscious.

01:56.583 --> 01:59.820
I--I think she's okay.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.725
Bec isn't.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.161
â™ª (theme)

02:56.476 --> 02:58.845
WOMAN (on P. A.):
Dr. Evans to
OR nurses' station.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.682
Dr. Evans
to OR nurses' station.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.350
Dr. Hoffman
to medical records.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.953
Dr. Hoffman to
medical records.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.955
Have you received
any threats or --

03:08.989 --> 03:10.557
To bomb us? No.

03:10.591 --> 03:11.592
Lucy Hatcher?

03:11.625 --> 03:12.593
That's us.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.294
She's okay.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.663
She suffered a concussion,
a couple of lacerations.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.231
Other than that,
just some bruises.

03:18.264 --> 03:19.866
The x-rays were all negative.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.902
-Can we see her?
-She's being stitched up.

03:21.935 --> 03:22.969
After that,
they'll bring her out.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.470
What about Rebecca Washington?

03:24.505 --> 03:25.506
The other doctors
are treating her.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.007
I'll check for you.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.610
Bobby!
Is she okay?

03:29.643 --> 03:30.777
We don't know.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.412
(sighs)

03:32.445 --> 03:33.647
The doctors
are still working on her.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.948
What happened?

03:34.981 --> 03:36.750
There was some kind of explosion
in the office.

03:36.783 --> 03:38.652
-What were her injuries?
-We're not sure yet.

03:38.685 --> 03:39.853
Is she conscious, or --

03:39.886 --> 03:41.588
I don't think so.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.924
ELLENOR: Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.458
Lucy.

03:45.491 --> 03:47.761
Whoa, whoa.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.330
Are you all right?

03:50.363 --> 03:52.699
Yeah. Just...
Some stitches.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.800
What happened?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.969
William Hinks.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.038
What?

03:58.071 --> 04:00.974
There was a tape recorder
with a message in it.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.777
Something about
him getting the last laugh,

04:03.810 --> 04:06.046
and...Bec said, "Run!"

04:06.079 --> 04:08.348
And then everything
just blew up.

04:08.381 --> 04:11.351
The voice --
He identified himself as Hinks?

04:11.384 --> 04:12.753
I know his voice.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.690
Jimmy.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.058
Lucy's okay.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.692
We don't know
about Rebecca.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.494
Hinks sent a bomb.

04:23.496 --> 04:27.834
Can I talk to you a bit
about this tape recorder?

04:27.868 --> 04:29.636
Yeah.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.739
I'd also like you to talk to
some people from our bomb squad.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.074
How'd it get there?

04:34.107 --> 04:35.909
Hinks' probate attorney
sent it over.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.744
Do you know his name?

04:37.778 --> 04:40.313
There might have been a letter,
but I don't remember.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.084
Rebecca Washington?

04:44.117 --> 04:46.086
That's my daughter.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.455
She suffered some pretty tough
internal injuries.

04:49.489 --> 04:50.891
There's also some swelling
in the brain.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.659
She's still unconscious,

04:52.693 --> 04:55.762
and probably will stay that way
until the swelling goes down.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.532
We need to repair her spleen,

04:58.565 --> 05:00.734
and it's possible
that she may lose a kidney.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.769
She's on her way
to the O. R. Now.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.672
Is she going to live,
doctor?

05:05.706 --> 05:07.508
Well, we're hoping
she will, yes.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.475
We're all hoping.
The question is, will she?

05:09.510 --> 05:11.477
Well, we'll know better
once we get in there.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.479
I'll come out
as soon as we're finished.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.748
Doctor.

05:14.781 --> 05:16.617
No transfusions.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.384
I'm sorry?

05:18.418 --> 05:20.120
My daughter,
she's a Jehovah's Witness.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.923
She can't have
any blood transfusions.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.525
She's not
a Jehovah's Witness.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.792
-She is.
-Helaine --

05:25.826 --> 05:28.394
Bobby, I know
my daughter's faith,

05:28.428 --> 05:30.396
and she would not want
a transfusion

05:30.430 --> 05:31.865
under any circumstances.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.935
Mrs. Washington, she's already
lost a lot of blood.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.937
To withhold a transfusion
at this point

05:36.970 --> 05:38.939
would pose a very grave risk.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.674
You can do the surgery.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.776
You can use
non-blood alternatives,

05:42.809 --> 05:44.978
but no blood.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.981
Are there any other
family members here?

05:48.014 --> 05:49.683
I'm her only family.

05:49.716 --> 05:50.684
Helaine, I think --

05:50.717 --> 05:52.586
Bobby, no.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.691
What are we facing?

05:57.724 --> 05:59.993
We can do auto-transfusions
for the surgery.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.461
What's that mean?

06:01.494 --> 06:03.429
We basically recycle
her own blood,

06:03.463 --> 06:05.899
but she's lost almost
3 liters coming in.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.968
The odds of her surviving
without a transfusion --

06:08.001 --> 06:09.102
Let me talk to her.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.103
Bobby.

06:10.136 --> 06:11.838
I said no.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.575
Do the surgery.
No blood.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.009
One second, Helaine.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.711
This is my daughter.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.079
One second.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.186
What do I need to do?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.487
I'm sorry?

06:27.521 --> 06:28.822
To authorize
the transfusion.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.190
You need to convince
the mother.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.758
The patient's intent --

06:31.792 --> 06:33.727
I can't take your word
over her mother's

06:33.760 --> 06:35.896
on what the patient's intent is.
I'm sorry.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.898
I'm going to go over
to the mother,

06:37.931 --> 06:39.733
then I'll come back to you
and tell you she consented.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.001
Then you'll be authorized
to give the transfusion.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.035
Then you'll be covered.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.504
This authorization

06:43.537 --> 06:44.838
isn't to technically
cover the surgeons.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.840
It's to protect
the patient's rights.

06:46.873 --> 06:49.042
How is this patient protected
if she's going to die?

06:49.075 --> 06:52.178
Mr. Donnell, the ethics
of this arena are perhaps

06:52.212 --> 06:53.980
a little different
than the one you're
used to playing in.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.949
Tell me, how does it
become more ethical

06:55.982 --> 06:57.951
to let her die
in your arena, Doctor?

06:57.984 --> 06:59.786
I'm sorry,
but this hospital needs more

06:59.820 --> 07:01.722
than your personal assurance

07:01.755 --> 07:03.189
to perform this transfusion.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.599
I'm going to court
first thing in the morning.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.701
In the meantime,
keep working on Helaine.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.169
Okay.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.975
(indistinct chatter)

07:22.008 --> 07:24.444
(police radio chatter)

07:31.585 --> 07:33.520
Watch your
step, sir.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.791
We found this correspondence
in the debris.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.225
It's from Roland Hofstra.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.795
He's a probate attorney.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.096
"Dear Ms. Dole,

07:43.129 --> 07:46.066
"My client bequeathed
this item to you.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.735
Sincerely,
Roland Hofstra."

07:48.769 --> 07:50.971
Lucy must have
thrown it away.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.272
She could've.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.976
She was kind of in a daze
over her rape case.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.277
How's Rebecca?

07:57.310 --> 08:00.547
She's still in surgery.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.983
Um, Bobby's going
to go into court.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.819
The mother
still won't budge?

08:05.852 --> 08:07.821
MAN: Detective?

08:09.289 --> 08:11.157
Ellenor?

08:12.859 --> 08:14.094
Kevin?

08:14.127 --> 08:15.662
My God, what happened?

08:15.696 --> 08:18.131
It looks like
a bomb went off.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.836
WOMAN (on P. A.):
Wheelchair to admitting.

08:22.869 --> 08:25.271
Wheelchair to admitting.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.875
Dr. Berenger to ER 3.
Dr. Berenger to ER 3.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.877
We repaired the spleen.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.946
Uh, no other internal organs
were damaged.

08:32.979 --> 08:34.815
We didn't have to
take the kidney.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.650
She came through
pretty well.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.652
The blood loss
is still a major concern.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.254
Her heart rate is 168.
It should be in the 70s.

08:41.287 --> 08:44.658
Right now our biggest worry
is that she could go into shock.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.560
Can I see her?

08:46.593 --> 08:47.928
She'll be taken to I. C. U.

08:47.961 --> 08:48.995
You can see her there
in about an hour.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.296
Thank you.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.699
She really needs blood,
Mrs. Washington.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.771
I'll have a nurse
bring you to I. C. U.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.879
Helaine, please.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.283
Eugene,
when she was in surgery

09:10.316 --> 09:13.854
you sat there for a long time
with your eyes closed.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.857
What were you doing?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.224
Praying.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.293
You turned to your faith.

09:20.326 --> 09:23.897
My daughter and I
would like to turn to ours.

09:30.303 --> 09:33.640
No warning, no hearing.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.309
Okay. Did you facilitate
the relationship?

09:36.342 --> 09:38.144
No! I knew about it,
but that's it.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.146
I was fired
because a fellow teacher

09:40.180 --> 09:43.149
had an affair with a student
and I didn't report him.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.285
That's the extent
of my participation,

09:45.318 --> 09:46.920
if you could even
call it that.

09:46.953 --> 09:49.155
Were you involved
in a cover-up?

09:49.189 --> 09:51.091
No! Ellenor, you know me.
I would nev--

09:51.124 --> 09:53.059
Okay.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.161
The teacher
who had the affair--

09:55.195 --> 09:56.797
He's a friend?

09:56.830 --> 09:59.232
Yes. That's probably
the problem.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.935
They're finding me guilty
by association.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.804
It's not right.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.672
I didn't do anything wrong.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.208
When's the hearing
with the school board?

10:08.241 --> 10:09.676
This afternoon.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.211
And you're coming to me now?

10:11.244 --> 10:15.181
I was going to have
my union rep do it, but...

10:15.215 --> 10:18.418
Kevin, one of my partners
just got critically injured.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.821
I don't think that I'm--

10:21.955 --> 10:23.289
Okay.

10:24.424 --> 10:28.194
Actually, the distraction...

10:28.228 --> 10:30.997
There's nothing
we can really do here.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.938
I'll do this.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.674
Let me take one shot
with the principal.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.008
What's he like?

10:42.042 --> 10:46.046
Usually fair,
but he's also stubborn.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.781
Is he at school now?

10:47.814 --> 10:49.049
I'm sure he is.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.084
Let's go.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.689
What do you expect me to do?

10:55.722 --> 10:57.323
Give me a court order.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.860
To override a person's
religious freedom?

10:59.893 --> 11:01.327
It's my opinion

11:01.361 --> 11:03.396
that Rebecca Washington
would want the transfusion.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.298
And that would mean something
if your opinion mattered,

11:05.331 --> 11:06.967
but it doesn't, Mr. Donnell.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.702
You have no standing here,
and you know it.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.336
I believe
an argument can be made

11:10.370 --> 11:12.272
to substitute my judgment
for the mother's.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.074
Even if that's true,

11:14.107 --> 11:15.876
that argument is certainly not
going to be made ex parte.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.410
Time is of the essence.

11:17.443 --> 11:19.445
Then why did you come here
without Mrs. Washington?

11:19.479 --> 11:21.247
She was in the hospital room
with you.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.315
Your honor --

11:22.348 --> 11:23.817
You came looking for a favor.

11:23.850 --> 11:24.918
Your honor, I believe --

11:24.951 --> 11:26.452
But I don't give them,

11:26.486 --> 11:28.989
and truth be told,
I'm offended that you'd think--

11:29.022 --> 11:31.324
I don't give a damn
whether you're offended or not.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.059
A person could die here.

11:33.093 --> 11:36.329
However close to her
you may be...

11:37.764 --> 11:41.101
If she doesn't get
the transfusion,

11:41.134 --> 11:43.837
she will die.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.175
I'll give you a hearing.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.979
With the mother.

11:53.013 --> 11:56.883
Give her notice right now,
and I'll see you in an hour.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.530
It's only a presumption
in favor of family members.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.231
It's not codified anywhere.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.133
Just print the cases.
I'll read them on the way over.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.135
The best ones
are from New Jersey.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.770
I highlighted
first circuit.

12:16.803 --> 12:17.971
You okay?

12:18.004 --> 12:19.773
Yeah, it's just
my stupid back.

12:19.806 --> 12:22.142
That was Eugene.
She's still unconscious.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.778
(sighs) Come on, Lindsay,
we should go.

12:24.811 --> 12:26.046
Are you okay?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.281
I'm fine.
Just go.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.785
I just thought,

12:31.818 --> 12:33.319
without trivializing
the infraction

12:33.353 --> 12:35.155
of a teacher having
a sexual liaison

12:35.188 --> 12:36.456
with a student,

12:36.489 --> 12:38.091
we can all agree

12:38.124 --> 12:40.894
Kevin Riley never condoned
Milton Buttle's actions.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.063
I don't think that we can
agree to that at all.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.532
Your client was complicit
with his silence, Ms. Tut.

12:45.566 --> 12:48.434
Excuse me, it's Frutt.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.537
And while we can question

12:50.571 --> 12:52.839
Kevin's decision
to remain silent,

12:52.873 --> 12:54.575
nothing in his behavior
suggests

12:54.608 --> 12:57.210
that he either approved
of the affair or even--

12:57.243 --> 12:59.012
Nothing in his behavior
suggests he disapproved of it.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.046
That isn't true, Steven,
and you --

13:00.080 --> 13:02.015
Kevin.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.384
A punishment must be
proportionate to the crime,

13:04.417 --> 13:05.852
wouldn't you agree there,
Mr. Harper?

13:05.886 --> 13:07.521
I would.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.355
Does this seem
proportionate?

13:09.389 --> 13:10.490
Kevin got the same sanction
as Milton Buttle.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.092
This sounds like an argument

13:12.125 --> 13:14.160
you should probably be making
with the school board.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.429
I was hoping it wouldn't
have to come to that.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.098
Well, I'm afraid it will.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.800
My decision is final here.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.538
You know,
my uncle's a teacher.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.107
Oh. Well, then by all means,
Mr. Riley, you're reinstated.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.577
We had no idea
Mr. Berluti had an uncle.

13:30.611 --> 13:33.580
I don't think we need
to get sarcastic.

13:33.614 --> 13:36.382
What I was about to say,

13:36.416 --> 13:39.953
my uncle, he keeps telling me
how we need good teachers,

13:39.986 --> 13:41.555
how there's
this big shortage,

13:41.588 --> 13:43.857
and here --
This is a good one.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.592
The reason we need
more teachers, Mr. Berluti,

13:45.626 --> 13:48.194
is that people are forsaking
the profession

13:48.228 --> 13:52.032
due to the continuing erosion
of respect for educators,

13:52.065 --> 13:54.334
which erosion
we will never stem

13:54.367 --> 13:57.237
until we begin to get serious
about weeding out the bad ones.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.139
-That's a bunch
of garbage, Scott.
-ELLENOR: Kevin.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.874
You think the teaching
profession will flourish

14:00.907 --> 14:02.943
with you
as the poster boy?

14:02.976 --> 14:05.278
Mr. Riley, if Lisa Grier
had been one year younger,

14:05.311 --> 14:07.147
your face might be
appearing on posters

14:07.180 --> 14:08.515
along with Milton Buttle's.

14:08.549 --> 14:10.350
-Oh, that's funny.
-ELLENOR: Okay.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.586
All right, look, this isn't
a decision we made easily,

14:12.619 --> 14:14.588
but it is one which was,
nevertheless, warranted,

14:14.621 --> 14:16.256
and I'll stick by it.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.591
If you want to take your case
to the school board,

14:17.624 --> 14:19.626
you are certainly free
to do so.

14:19.660 --> 14:22.863
Any other way I can
be helpful, Ms. Frutt?

14:24.030 --> 14:26.166
Well, maybe a tip.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.268
I've never appeared before
the school board before,

14:28.301 --> 14:29.903
so I was wondering,

14:29.936 --> 14:32.005
does your kind
of blatant condescension

14:32.038 --> 14:34.374
prove to be persuasive there?

14:35.408 --> 14:37.177
I think we're done.

14:37.210 --> 14:41.648
No, Mr. Harper,
we're not.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.353
I thought it was
a tape recorder.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.122
Where were you keeping it,
Mr. Hofstra?

14:49.155 --> 14:51.024
Look, I'm not comfortable
answering all --

14:51.057 --> 14:52.926
You're not going anywhere,
Mr. Hofstra.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.628
You will answer
these questions.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.429
Please sit.

15:00.601 --> 15:02.302
Where were you keeping it?

15:02.335 --> 15:04.204
In a safety-deposit box.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.572
And he instructed you

15:05.606 --> 15:06.673
to deliver it to Ms. Dole
upon his death?

15:06.707 --> 15:08.408
Yes.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.944
Why didn't you identify it
as coming from Mr. Hinks?

15:10.977 --> 15:13.213
That was one of the stipulations
in the codicil,

15:13.246 --> 15:15.115
that he didn't want
to be identified.

15:15.148 --> 15:18.018
Did you know Mr. Hinks
to be an alleged serial killer?

15:18.051 --> 15:21.387
Well, certainly
he talked about it, but...

15:21.421 --> 15:23.957
Ms. Gamble,
it was a will.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.059
I am a trust
and estates attorney.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.061
I--I thought
it was a tape recorder.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.230
I had it in my own safe.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.633
I never suspected it
to be a bomb.

15:36.637 --> 15:38.438
Place him under arrest.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.608
-What?
-Right now it's an accessory
to a felony.

15:41.642 --> 15:44.410
If Rebecca Washington dies,
that felony becomes murder.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.046
You can't be serious.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.247
Michael.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.716
Mr. Hofstra,
you can go.

15:49.750 --> 15:51.184
Richard --

15:51.217 --> 15:53.554
Do not leave the jurisdiction.
Now get out.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.626
Helen --

15:59.660 --> 16:02.262
Richard, a woman
is almost dead.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.698
You know me.
I like to arrest everybody.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.267
But the thing was in
his own safety-deposit box.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.369
He clearly didn't think
it was a bomb.

16:09.402 --> 16:12.005
It's still negligence!
He knows the guy to be a killer.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.607
And even if
there were a case,

16:13.640 --> 16:15.175
you essentially
just squashed it yourself.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.376
You didn't
Mirandize the guy.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.644
-Come on.
-Lawyer or not,

16:17.678 --> 16:19.212
he has to be
read his rights.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.714
Only if it's custodial.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.216
Which it became once
you wouldn't let him leave.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.756
Look, emotions
are running high here,

16:29.790 --> 16:32.759
but there's no case to be made
against this attorney.

16:32.793 --> 16:34.995
At least, not yet.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.435
Though there might be
a presumption

16:42.468 --> 16:44.738
in favor of family members,
it's not conclusive.

16:44.771 --> 16:48.308
I direct the court's attention
in re: 1987, case in New Jersey.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.578
There, the court wanted to vest
decisions of medical treatment

16:51.612 --> 16:53.714
with the most
concerned parties.

16:53.747 --> 16:56.049
Wouldn't it be tough
to beat the mother on that?

16:56.082 --> 16:58.585
Not when the mother
is refusing the transfusion,

16:58.619 --> 17:00.453
risking the patient's life.

17:00.486 --> 17:02.455
There are also
two other legal standards

17:02.488 --> 17:04.558
being employed by the courts.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.660
The best interests
of the patient --

17:06.693 --> 17:09.829
Here, again, saving her life
would be in her best interests.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.232
Your honor, this is about
a religious choice.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.835
The cases Mr. Donnell talks
about involve medical decisions.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.203
Certainly, if Mrs. Washington
were trying to impose

17:17.237 --> 17:18.571
her medical judgments,

17:18.605 --> 17:20.473
the doctors or the courts
could step in.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.208
That is not
what she is doing.

17:22.242 --> 17:25.411
She is exercising
a religious freedom.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.614
Yes -- The mother's freedom.

17:27.647 --> 17:31.084
This does not reflect
what Rebecca would want,

17:31.117 --> 17:32.318
which brings us to

17:32.352 --> 17:34.220
the substituted judgment
standard.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.089
In the absence of a clear
directive from the patient,

17:36.122 --> 17:39.159
the court can substitute
its judgment for that patient,

17:39.192 --> 17:40.160
and in looking to --

17:40.193 --> 17:42.162
Hold on, Mr. Donnell.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.164
Jehovah's Witnesses are against
blood transfusions.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.099
Is there any dispute
about that?

17:46.132 --> 17:48.835
It seems, then,
that the only question

17:48.869 --> 17:50.537
is whether or not
Ms. Washington is,

17:50.571 --> 17:52.606
in fact, a Jehovah's Witness,
because if she is --

17:52.639 --> 17:53.840
She isn't.

17:53.874 --> 17:55.576
We have the declaration
of her mother.

17:55.609 --> 17:57.443
I can also proffer
other Jehovah's Witnesses

17:57.477 --> 17:59.445
who have attended meetings
with her.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.515
Even if she is, I submit
there are Jehovah's Witnesses

18:01.548 --> 18:03.517
who would take the transfusion.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.285
Oh, come on, counsel.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.253
Just like there are Catholics
who favor birth control

18:07.287 --> 18:09.623
and Jews who believe in Jesus.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.892
Just because somebody subscribes
to a particular religion

18:11.925 --> 18:13.860
doesn't mean he or she accepts
all the tenets practiced.

18:13.894 --> 18:16.129
But certainly the presumption
would have to be

18:16.162 --> 18:17.363
that she wouldn't want
the transfusion.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.799
How can you make
that presumption

18:18.832 --> 18:20.701
when the likely result
is death?

18:20.734 --> 18:22.703
Shouldn't the benefit
of the doubt

18:22.736 --> 18:24.571
go to her surviving?

18:24.605 --> 18:26.472
Look, unless
you can demonstrate

18:26.507 --> 18:29.342
that Ms. Washington would
accept a transfusion...

18:30.844 --> 18:32.312
Can you?

18:32.345 --> 18:35.549
I believe with a short
evidentiary hearing

18:35.582 --> 18:41.421
we could prove that she would
want the transfusion, yes.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.525
Let's go, then.

18:44.558 --> 18:48.328
Well, we need an hour to...
Get our witnesses.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.796
You have an hour.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.870
What are you
going to do?

18:56.903 --> 18:58.672
I'm open to suggestions.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.541
Actually,
Rebecca told you once

19:00.574 --> 19:02.609
that she would want
the transfusion, right?

19:02.643 --> 19:04.678
No, Fox would see through that.
I think she told Lucy.

19:04.711 --> 19:05.679
Bobby --

19:05.712 --> 19:07.180
I can't just let her die.

19:07.213 --> 19:08.782
You're not going
to suborn perjury.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.450
Everybody can sue me
after she wakes up.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.952
No, Bobby,
I won't let you.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.354
What are we supposed
to do, Lindsay?
Sit back and--

19:14.387 --> 19:15.889
You're not gonna
lie to the court.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.733
Yes, she's right over there.

19:26.767 --> 19:29.202
WOMAN (on P. A.):
Dr. Blair, Dr. Hamilton...

19:35.909 --> 19:37.744
Eugene?

19:37.778 --> 19:41.214
No change.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.850
They just gave her
a cat-scan, yeah.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.954
The swelling in her brain
is going down.

19:50.256 --> 19:51.391
That's good.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.797
What happened in court?

19:56.830 --> 19:59.399
The judge wants a hearing.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.568
We have to go back.

20:06.507 --> 20:09.576
Why are all of you
doing this?

20:11.044 --> 20:13.479
We love her.

20:13.514 --> 20:15.849
I know you do, too.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.520
Everybody's just trying to do
what they think is right.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.993
She feels so cold.

20:27.027 --> 20:28.895
That's the blood loss,
Helaine.

20:28.929 --> 20:30.931
Her extremities
are getting cold--

20:36.703 --> 20:39.305
Can I ask...

20:39.339 --> 20:42.609
What's the harm
in giving her blood?

20:42.643 --> 20:47.447
It's a Biblical prohibition,
Eugene.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.723
I'm right here, baby.

20:58.592 --> 21:01.294
Your mother's right here.

21:19.613 --> 21:21.748
BAILIFF: All rise.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.623
Be seated.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.061
All right, Mr. Donnell,
let's hear from you.

21:35.095 --> 21:38.364
I'd like to call
a witness, your honor.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.534
Yes, I gathered as much.
Go ahead.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.469
I call Helaine Washington
to the stand.

21:43.504 --> 21:44.538
I'm sorry.
What is going on?

21:44.571 --> 21:45.839
We're trying to determine

21:45.872 --> 21:47.440
Rebecca Washington's
intent here.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.609
Her mother's claiming
she knows that intent.

21:48.642 --> 21:49.976
I'd like to explore.

21:50.010 --> 21:52.879
My client has faced enough
persecution, your honor.

21:52.913 --> 21:54.781
Her daughter is deathly ill,

21:54.815 --> 21:56.783
now she's forced
to be in court --

21:56.817 --> 21:57.951
Her daughter is deathly ill
because of this witness,

21:57.984 --> 21:59.085
and we're in court to --

21:59.119 --> 22:00.486
I object to that.

22:00.521 --> 22:01.822
Bobby...

22:01.855 --> 22:03.824
Mr. Donnell, I am not
going to allow you

22:03.857 --> 22:05.692
to beat answers out
of this witness to bolster--

22:05.726 --> 22:08.028
Am I allowed an evidentiary
hearing here or not?

22:10.063 --> 22:11.665
Forgive my breach
of decorum,

22:11.698 --> 22:13.900
but get your ass up
to this bench right now.

22:21.642 --> 22:23.677
With all due respect
to your emotion,

22:23.710 --> 22:25.612
and I know
it runs deep here,

22:25.646 --> 22:28.915
I will not allow you
to abuse this process,

22:28.949 --> 22:31.852
that woman, or me.

22:31.885 --> 22:34.420
Have you got that,
Mr. Donnell?

22:34.454 --> 22:35.589
Yes.

22:35.622 --> 22:38.992
You keep yourself in check
and in line.

22:40.727 --> 22:44.898
All right, Mrs. Washington,
please take the witness chair.

22:57.010 --> 22:58.979
That's
the superintendent there,

22:59.012 --> 23:01.447
Marsha Shinn,
known as the dragon lady.

23:01.481 --> 23:04.518
Well, we won't be
calling her that.

23:04.551 --> 23:05.919
Are they close?

23:05.952 --> 23:08.454
No. They're basically enemies.

23:08.488 --> 23:11.091
They don't look like enemies
at the moment.

23:11.124 --> 23:12.793
Okay, let's get started.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.928
This meeting
of the Winslow school board

23:14.961 --> 23:16.563
is hereby called to order.

23:16.597 --> 23:18.565
Karen sawyer
will be recording minutes.

23:18.599 --> 23:22.669
We are to review
Principal Harper's decision

23:22.703 --> 23:24.838
to terminate the employment
of Kevin Riley.

23:24.871 --> 23:27.173
Now, Mr. Harper,
we'll begin with you.

23:27.207 --> 23:29.943
Could you briefly state
the cause of the discharge?

23:29.976 --> 23:32.779
And please limit yourself
to three minutes.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.653
One of my teachers,
Milton Buttle,

23:39.686 --> 23:41.688
was sleeping with a student.

23:41.722 --> 23:44.024
Kevin Riley knew about it

23:44.057 --> 23:46.793
and sat on
the information.

23:55.802 --> 23:58.505
If I have any time left over,

23:58.539 --> 24:00.641
I'd like to give it
to Miss Frutt.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.847
How long have we known
each other, Helaine?

24:06.880 --> 24:08.214
More than 10 years.

24:08.248 --> 24:10.016
And over that time,
I've seen your daughter

24:10.050 --> 24:11.017
almost every single day,
haven't I?

24:11.051 --> 24:12.218
I'm sure that's true.

24:12.252 --> 24:14.054
How often do you see her?

24:14.087 --> 24:15.756
Not as much as I'd like.

24:15.789 --> 24:17.257
One day a week? Less?

24:17.290 --> 24:20.961
Less, but that doesn't mean
that we're not close.

24:20.994 --> 24:22.696
No, it doesn't,

24:22.729 --> 24:24.497
but can you make room
for the possibility

24:24.531 --> 24:25.498
that I know more
about her life

24:25.532 --> 24:27.000
then perhaps you do?

24:27.033 --> 24:28.602
I'm sure you know lots
of things about her I don't,

24:28.635 --> 24:30.704
but clearly
you had little idea

24:30.737 --> 24:32.706
as to her
religious beliefs.

24:32.739 --> 24:34.140
Which is odd, isn't it?

24:34.174 --> 24:36.209
Isn't it customary
for Jehovah's Witnesses

24:36.242 --> 24:38.078
to preach their faith
to others?

24:38.111 --> 24:40.146
Not all Jehovah's Witnesses
are comfortable doing that.

24:40.180 --> 24:42.215
Not all?
We're talking about Rebecca.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.551
Have you ever known Rebecca
to be shy

24:44.585 --> 24:46.553
or uncomfortable
expressing her opinion?

24:46.587 --> 24:49.289
No, but perhaps
she feared bigotry.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.825
Not everybody is as
open-minded as you, Bobby.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.560
Yes, let's talk
about bigotry.

24:53.594 --> 24:55.896
Have you ever known Rebecca
to be guilty of bigotry?

24:55.929 --> 24:57.664
No.
In fact,
I don't know anybody

24:57.698 --> 24:59.065
who rebels
against oppression

24:59.099 --> 25:00.734
or prejudice
more than her,

25:00.767 --> 25:01.935
do you?

25:01.968 --> 25:03.604
Probably not.

25:03.637 --> 25:06.239
How do Jehovah's Witnesses
feel about homosexuals?

25:06.272 --> 25:09.543
Homosexuality
is considered a sin.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.812
Have you ever known Rebecca
to condemn homosexuality?

25:11.845 --> 25:14.080
-No.
-What about divorce?

25:14.114 --> 25:16.016
Under your faith,
a married couple

25:16.049 --> 25:18.084
is only allowed to divorce
in cases of adultery.

25:18.118 --> 25:20.086
Anything else would be a sin,
am I right?

25:20.120 --> 25:22.055
-Yes.
-And yet Rebecca
has represented clients,

25:22.088 --> 25:24.825
negotiated,
even facilitated divorces

25:24.858 --> 25:26.827
in cases other than adultery.

25:26.860 --> 25:28.829
Is that consistent with being
a Jehovah's Witness?

25:28.862 --> 25:31.832
My daughter is against
blood transfusions.

25:31.865 --> 25:33.700
She said that to you
specifically.

25:33.734 --> 25:35.969
She didn't have to
say it specifically.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.104
It's fundamental
to our faith.

25:38.138 --> 25:39.706
Leviticus says,

25:39.740 --> 25:43.109
"Whatsoever man eateth
any manner of blood,

25:43.143 --> 25:46.312
he will cut him off
from among his people."

25:46.346 --> 25:48.181
So she might be
against transfusions,

25:48.214 --> 25:50.584
but not necessarily
homosexuals and divorce.

25:50.617 --> 25:51.818
Objection.

25:51.852 --> 25:53.353
Your honor,
Rebecca Washington's life

25:53.386 --> 25:56.022
is at stake here --
Her life.

25:56.056 --> 25:58.124
If there's even a question

25:58.158 --> 25:59.826
as to whether she really is
a Jehovah's Witness --

25:59.860 --> 26:01.862
There is no question.

26:01.895 --> 26:05.331
Rebecca has a problem
with bigotry,

26:05.365 --> 26:07.801
I grant you
she probably does disagree

26:07.834 --> 26:09.903
with the condemnation
of homosexuality, but--

26:09.936 --> 26:11.905
What about premarital sex?
That's a sin, too,

26:11.938 --> 26:13.373
according to
the Jehovah's Witness faith.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.942
Does your daughter condemn
premarital sex?

26:15.976 --> 26:19.145
I'm sure she may have issue
with some of our tenets,

26:19.179 --> 26:22.148
but as for our
fundamental ones,

26:22.182 --> 26:24.050
and this would be--

26:24.084 --> 26:25.351
When she became a lawyer,

26:25.385 --> 26:26.820
did you attend
her swearing-in ceremony?

26:26.853 --> 26:29.055
Yes, I did,
and you were there, too.

26:29.089 --> 26:31.291
I remember her pledging
allegiance to the flag.

26:31.324 --> 26:33.159
That's against your religion,
isn't it?

26:33.193 --> 26:36.329
As long as you don't
conscientiously participate --

26:36.362 --> 26:38.031
She was saying the words,

26:38.064 --> 26:40.734
pledging her allegiance
to an emblem.

26:43.937 --> 26:46.172
What about abortion?

26:46.206 --> 26:48.809
That's prohibited
by your religion, isn't it?

26:48.842 --> 26:50.343
Very.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.178
Would you consider that one
of the fundamental tenets?

26:52.212 --> 26:54.147
I would.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.782
Would Rebecca
ever have an abortion?

26:55.816 --> 26:57.183
Absolutely not.

26:57.217 --> 27:00.286
Did you know she had one?

27:05.792 --> 27:10.196
Did you know your daughter
had an abortion, Helaine?

27:14.434 --> 27:16.069
No, I didn't.

27:18.438 --> 27:21.975
Homosexuality, divorce,
premarital sex,

27:22.008 --> 27:23.977
saluting flags, abortion --

27:24.010 --> 27:25.979
Jehovah's Witnesses
are against all these things,

27:26.012 --> 27:28.982
yet Rebecca doesn't condemn
any of them.

27:29.015 --> 27:31.384
She is not
a Jehovah's Witness.

27:31.417 --> 27:35.756
She is, and she's against
blood transfusions.

27:35.789 --> 27:37.157
Why doesn't she carry
a blood card?

27:37.190 --> 27:38.959
Jehovah's typically carry
blood cards

27:38.992 --> 27:40.126
to prevent transfusions,
don't they?

27:40.160 --> 27:42.428
It is not a requirement.

27:42.462 --> 27:43.964
But if she
were really opposed

27:43.997 --> 27:45.999
to such a transfusion,
did she just forget

27:46.032 --> 27:47.133
to put it in her wallet,
Helaine?

27:47.167 --> 27:49.002
Objection!

27:49.035 --> 27:50.203
It's your own daughter,
for God's sake.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.204
Your honor!

27:51.237 --> 27:52.205
You're letting her die.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.807
Counsel!
Objection!

27:53.840 --> 27:56.276
Your own daughter!
You're letting this voodoo --

27:56.309 --> 27:57.711
Objection!

27:57.744 --> 27:58.745
Mr. Donnell!

27:58.779 --> 28:01.347
Your own daughter.

28:07.287 --> 28:09.389
As you go through
the teacher's handbook,

28:09.422 --> 28:10.724
the principal's bylines,

28:10.757 --> 28:12.893
and the board's
own directives,

28:12.926 --> 28:15.829
nowhere does it call
for a teacher's discharge

28:15.862 --> 28:17.363
for failing to report
the misconduct

28:17.397 --> 28:18.464
of another teacher.

28:18.498 --> 28:20.133
Are you claiming
that Mr. Harper

28:20.166 --> 28:21.935
had no authority
to fire Mr. Riley?

28:21.968 --> 28:24.304
I am saying
he had discretion,

28:24.337 --> 28:25.939
and given that,

28:25.972 --> 28:27.207
we should look
at Mr. Riley's record

28:27.240 --> 28:29.042
in its totality,
and in so --

28:29.075 --> 28:31.044
If you're admitting this is
discretionary, Miss Frutt,

28:31.077 --> 28:33.279
what's the basis
of your challenge?

28:33.313 --> 28:35.181
I am saying
Mr. Harper's decision

28:35.215 --> 28:36.917
was an abuse
of his discretion.

28:36.950 --> 28:38.351
To terminate --

28:38.384 --> 28:40.921
Do you agree Milton Buttle
should have been fired?

28:40.954 --> 28:42.455
Yes, but --

28:42.488 --> 28:44.925
What if Milton Buttle
had carried on this affair

28:44.958 --> 28:46.359
using Kevin Riley's apartment?

28:46.392 --> 28:48.094
That never happened.

28:48.128 --> 28:50.030
I'm asking you
what if it did,

28:50.063 --> 28:52.298
if Mr. Riley had offered up
the keys to his apartment?

28:52.332 --> 28:54.267
That might be
participation, but --

28:54.300 --> 28:56.302
What if he just offered
words of encouragement?

28:56.336 --> 28:57.838
"Go for it, Milt."

28:57.871 --> 29:00.273
Would he have crossed
the line there?

29:00.306 --> 29:03.376
I think, yes, but again
he didn't do that.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.311
Maybe not,
but saying nothing,

29:05.345 --> 29:08.014
can't that be construed
as tacit approval?

29:08.048 --> 29:10.216
He did say something
to Milton Buttle.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.786
He unequivocally
denounced the relationship

29:12.819 --> 29:14.154
and told him to end it.

29:14.187 --> 29:16.289
He only was silent
with Steven Harper

29:16.322 --> 29:18.491
and Scott Guber.

29:18.525 --> 29:22.328
Okay, I think we understand
your position.

29:22.362 --> 29:24.130
Mr. Harper?

29:24.164 --> 29:27.801
You know my position.

29:40.581 --> 29:43.449
The board votes
to discharge Kevin Riley.

29:43.483 --> 29:45.085
Thank you.

29:45.118 --> 29:46.419
This meeting is adjourned.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.054
Wait a second.
What's the rush?

29:48.088 --> 29:50.390
You have an appropriate remedy
with the court,

29:50.423 --> 29:52.058
should you choose to appeal.

29:53.426 --> 29:55.929
What the hell was that,
Steven?

29:55.962 --> 29:58.565
Kevin, the best thing
you could do now

29:58.599 --> 30:01.134
is start taking
responsibility.

30:02.603 --> 30:04.404
Miss Frutt, Mr. Berluti.

30:08.909 --> 30:13.279
I'm sorry.
That was in the bag.

30:16.449 --> 30:19.219
Virtually all the cases,
all of them,

30:19.252 --> 30:21.121
where the courts are trying

30:21.154 --> 30:23.323
to make
these tough decisions,

30:23.356 --> 30:26.860
they've involved comatose
or vegetative patients.

30:26.893 --> 30:30.096
The choice was basically death
versus vegetable.

30:30.130 --> 30:35.301
Here the choice is death
versus full quality of life,

30:35.335 --> 30:37.237
complete recovery.

30:37.270 --> 30:40.040
The same legal standards
can't apply.

30:40.073 --> 30:42.408
If there's any doubt,
I say it again --

30:42.442 --> 30:45.311
It has to be in favor
of Rebecca Washington's life.

30:45.345 --> 30:47.447
But, Counsel,
I would agree

30:47.480 --> 30:49.516
if this was
a medical decision,

30:49.550 --> 30:51.217
but again this involves

30:51.251 --> 30:53.319
a person's
religious freedom.

30:53.353 --> 30:55.155
And I submit she's not
a Jehovah's Witness,

30:55.188 --> 30:56.489
not for real.

30:56.523 --> 30:59.125
They've given me
an affidavit

30:59.159 --> 31:00.260
from her fellow
congregates.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.595
Her mother --

31:01.628 --> 31:04.631
Rebecca and her mother
were estranged years ago.

31:04.665 --> 31:06.499
Maybe she joined this church

31:06.533 --> 31:08.168
to work
on their relationship.

31:08.201 --> 31:09.302
You're groping.

31:09.335 --> 31:11.471
I have worked side by side

31:11.505 --> 31:14.074
with Rebecca Washington
for 12 years.

31:14.107 --> 31:15.375
I know her.

31:15.408 --> 31:16.610
She doesn't go around
preaching to people

31:16.643 --> 31:17.978
on the streets.

31:18.011 --> 31:20.080
She doesn't
condemn homosexuality.

31:20.113 --> 31:21.948
She doesn't object
to the national anthem.

31:21.982 --> 31:24.284
She doesn't denounce
premarital sex.

31:24.317 --> 31:27.187
She had an abortion herself.

31:27.220 --> 31:29.089
She represents clients
in divorce cases.

31:29.122 --> 31:30.624
None of this
is reconcilable

31:30.657 --> 31:32.458
with her being
a Jehovah's Witness,

31:32.492 --> 31:33.694
none of it,

31:33.727 --> 31:36.262
and if you want to
believe she is,

31:36.296 --> 31:38.632
you have to believe
she's the kind

31:38.665 --> 31:41.101
that doesn't subscribe
to all its tenets,

31:41.134 --> 31:43.469
and given that,
given the possibility

31:43.504 --> 31:45.171
that she
might not subscribe

31:45.205 --> 31:49.109
to the prohibition
on transfusions.

31:49.142 --> 31:52.078
If there's
any question here...

31:55.290 --> 32:00.954
Please give her
the benefit of life.

32:02.589 --> 32:04.390
I love this woman,

32:04.424 --> 32:06.492
but the doctors
can't save her

32:06.527 --> 32:09.095
unless you allow them to.

32:26.747 --> 32:29.082
No.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.717
Your honor,
may I be heard?

32:30.751 --> 32:33.053
You may.

32:38.224 --> 32:40.527
I know my daughter.

32:40.561 --> 32:45.465
We've talked many hours
about our faith.

32:45.498 --> 32:48.635
She is a Jehovah's Witness.

32:48.669 --> 32:51.037
For a Jehovah's Witness,

32:51.071 --> 32:54.240
it is against God's law
to accept blood.

32:54.274 --> 32:57.077
There is no question there.

32:57.110 --> 33:00.446
There is no dispute
about that.

33:00.480 --> 33:06.152
It is the most fundamental
of all our tenets.

33:06.186 --> 33:09.155
Bobby Donnell
gave himself away

33:09.189 --> 33:12.593
when he called
our faith voodoo.

33:12.626 --> 33:15.061
Now, I'm sure to him
it is voodoo,

33:15.095 --> 33:20.233
but freedom of religion
extends to all religions,

33:20.266 --> 33:22.769
whether Bobby Donnell

33:22.803 --> 33:26.507
considers them reasonable
or not.

33:50.863 --> 33:52.188
Best I can figure,

33:52.236 --> 33:53.499
Harper and Shinn
have butted heads all year

33:53.534 --> 33:55.836
and she's just trying
to show support.

33:55.869 --> 33:57.370
Does she control the board?

33:57.403 --> 33:59.239
-Pretty much.
-All right, look,

33:59.272 --> 34:00.641
in victory
you can catch people

34:00.674 --> 34:02.242
at their most gracious,

34:02.275 --> 34:03.644
so what I would
like to do

34:03.677 --> 34:05.478
is take one last crack
at Harper.

34:05.512 --> 34:07.447
If he's as fair-minded
as you say,

34:07.480 --> 34:10.449
although personally
I have not seen that yet --

34:10.483 --> 34:11.717
Any word?

34:11.752 --> 34:13.820
Her blood pressure
has dropped to 90

34:13.853 --> 34:16.222
and her heart rate
is still really high.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.725
Did Fox say
when she'd rule?

34:18.759 --> 34:20.360
She promised by tonight.

34:33.507 --> 34:35.375
BAILIFF: All rise.

34:39.379 --> 34:41.380
Be seated.

34:49.723 --> 34:53.293
People have a right
to refuse medical treatment

34:53.326 --> 34:55.495
on religious grounds.

34:55.529 --> 34:58.364
Whether or not
Rebecca Washington

34:58.398 --> 35:01.267
would refuse
a blood transfusion,

35:01.301 --> 35:04.538
the truth is nobody here
knows for sure.

35:04.571 --> 35:06.707
As a Jehovah's Witness,

35:06.740 --> 35:08.441
my suspicion is she would,

35:08.474 --> 35:11.377
and therefore I shift
the burden to Mr. Donnell

35:11.411 --> 35:12.646
to prove otherwise.

35:12.679 --> 35:16.182
The fact
that Miss Washington

35:16.216 --> 35:18.652
rejected other tenets
of this faith

35:18.685 --> 35:21.888
does not persuade me
she'd reject this one.

35:21.922 --> 35:25.792
The fact remains the tenet
on transfusions,

35:25.826 --> 35:28.629
that goes to the core

35:28.662 --> 35:30.396
of the Jehovah's Witness
religion

35:30.430 --> 35:33.299
in that God treats blood
as sacred.

35:34.701 --> 35:37.303
Mrs. Washington,
are you sure

35:37.337 --> 35:39.439
this is what
your daughter would want?

35:41.842 --> 35:44.310
I am, your honor.

35:46.446 --> 35:49.415
Petitioner's motion
for a court order is denied.

35:49.449 --> 35:51.852
She is going to die.

35:51.885 --> 35:53.286
We're adjourned.

35:53.319 --> 35:54.955
-She is going to die.
-Counsel --

35:54.988 --> 35:56.356
I don't care.

35:56.389 --> 35:57.591
You want to hold me
in contempt, do it.

35:57.624 --> 35:58.859
I don't care!
She is going to die!

35:58.892 --> 36:00.527
I will hold you
in contempt.

36:00.561 --> 36:02.663
I'm taking this
to the court of appeals now!

36:02.696 --> 36:03.697
Oh, my God!

36:03.730 --> 36:04.831
Lindsay?

36:04.865 --> 36:06.499
-Lindsay?
-Oh, God!

36:06.533 --> 36:08.334
Get the paramedics!

36:08.368 --> 36:09.369
I think
she's hemorrhaging.

36:09.402 --> 36:10.671
HELAINE: Let me see.

36:10.704 --> 36:11.972
Oh, God.
I think he's coming out.

36:12.005 --> 36:13.373
What? Get a doctor!
Somebody get a doctor!

36:13.406 --> 36:15.441
He's coming!

36:15.475 --> 36:16.977
If you don't have
medical training,

36:17.010 --> 36:17.978
get out of this room now,
and that's an order.

36:18.011 --> 36:19.279
I was a nurse.

36:19.312 --> 36:20.814
Lindsay, hold on.
Help is coming.

36:20.847 --> 36:23.283
No! My God, he's not waiting!
He's coming!

36:23.316 --> 36:24.518
He's not due for a month.

36:24.551 --> 36:26.286
Well, he doesn't know that.

36:26.319 --> 36:27.921
Get on your back, Lindsay,
on your back.

36:27.954 --> 36:29.289
Okay.

36:29.322 --> 36:31.658
Get on your back.

36:31.692 --> 36:32.926
Okay, okay.

36:32.959 --> 36:34.260
Aah!

36:34.294 --> 36:37.397
Okay,
now I want you to push

36:37.430 --> 36:38.832
on the count of three.

36:38.865 --> 36:41.401
1, 2, 3.

36:41.935 --> 36:43.236
Aah!

36:43.269 --> 36:44.571
Where are the paramedics?

36:44.605 --> 36:45.839
The baby's coming now,
Mr. Donnell.

36:45.872 --> 36:47.808
That-a-girl.

36:47.841 --> 36:50.410
Now 1, 2, 3.

36:50.443 --> 36:52.679
Aah!

36:52.713 --> 36:54.014
Just hold on, Lindsay.

36:54.047 --> 36:56.482
Good, good.
Breathe deep, Lindsay.

36:56.517 --> 36:58.585
Breathe deep and push.

36:58.619 --> 36:59.953
No. It hurts.

36:59.986 --> 37:01.321
Just hold on, Lindsay.

37:01.354 --> 37:02.422
1, 2.

37:02.455 --> 37:03.824
Oh, shut up.
You hold on.

37:03.857 --> 37:05.325
Good, good. Push.

37:16.870 --> 37:18.672
It's 8:00.

37:18.705 --> 37:19.773
I took a guess.

37:19.806 --> 37:21.341
From your weak social skills,

37:21.374 --> 37:23.510
I figured you to have
no personal life

37:23.544 --> 37:25.445
and that
you'd still be working.

37:25.478 --> 37:28.448
Oh, I like that.
Can I steal it?

37:28.481 --> 37:31.718
Feel free.

37:31.752 --> 37:34.454
Have a seat.

37:34.487 --> 37:39.626
I know you can,
but do you have to?

37:41.027 --> 37:43.530
You don't give up,
do you?

37:43.564 --> 37:44.965
Well, the book on you

37:44.998 --> 37:47.467
is that you are both
compassionate and stubborn.

37:47.500 --> 37:48.869
I've seen the stubborn.

37:48.902 --> 37:51.538
And the book on you is
you personalize your cases.

37:51.572 --> 37:53.473
Well,
Kevin is also a friend,

37:53.507 --> 37:55.742
and I thought
he was one of yours.

37:55.776 --> 37:58.478
Yeah, which would make
his lying to me

37:58.512 --> 38:00.013
even more egregious,
wouldn't it?

38:00.046 --> 38:02.482
Is that why we're here,
because he lied?

38:02.516 --> 38:04.651
I'm here trying
to run a school,

38:04.685 --> 38:07.654
you're here apparently
to try to tell me how to.

38:07.688 --> 38:10.023
I am only here to try
to get you to reconsider.

38:10.056 --> 38:11.758
Asked and answered.

38:11.792 --> 38:13.627
Isn't that how it goes?

38:13.660 --> 38:16.630
Look, I did not
come here to fight

38:16.663 --> 38:20.500
and I don't really
want to go to court.

38:20.534 --> 38:23.904
Two weeks suspension,
that way --

38:23.937 --> 38:26.740
I don't have the authority
to suspend him.

38:26.773 --> 38:28.374
Why not?

38:28.408 --> 38:30.511
He doesn't
work here anymore.

38:30.544 --> 38:31.945
He was fired.

38:35.949 --> 38:39.686
Do you want to go
to court, Mr. Harper?

38:39.720 --> 38:43.456
Is that what
you really, really want?

38:47.027 --> 38:49.329
Seems I do.

38:51.131 --> 38:52.566
Push hard, honey.

38:52.599 --> 38:54.635
1, 2, 3.

38:54.668 --> 38:57.738
Aah!

38:57.771 --> 38:59.740
Good. I see the head.

38:59.773 --> 39:01.041
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Where? Where?

39:01.074 --> 39:02.375
Where do you think?

39:02.408 --> 39:04.077
You're one
last push away, okay?

39:04.110 --> 39:06.479
Now I want you
to bear down and push.

39:06.513 --> 39:07.548
Okay.

39:07.581 --> 39:09.583
You can push hard.
Come on.

39:09.616 --> 39:10.617
Okay, okay.

39:12.519 --> 39:13.486
Aah!

39:13.520 --> 39:14.487
Push!

39:14.521 --> 39:15.722
Here he comes.

39:15.756 --> 39:18.124
Okay, here he comes,
here he comes,

39:18.158 --> 39:19.593
here he comes.

39:19.626 --> 39:20.827
Oh, my God.

39:20.861 --> 39:22.395
(baby crying)

39:22.428 --> 39:23.764
Oh, my God.

39:25.431 --> 39:26.867
Oh, my God.

39:26.900 --> 39:29.002
Oh, he's a beauty.

39:29.035 --> 39:31.037
Oh, he's a beauty.

39:31.071 --> 39:32.606
Is he okay?

39:32.639 --> 39:34.508
He's perfect.

39:34.541 --> 39:35.876
(baby crying)

39:35.909 --> 39:38.044
Isn't he perfect?

39:38.078 --> 39:39.780
Bobby?

39:41.548 --> 39:42.949
We have a son.

39:42.983 --> 39:45.018
We have a son.

39:45.051 --> 39:46.520
You were a big help.

39:48.822 --> 39:50.524
May I see him, please?

39:50.557 --> 39:51.992
Sure.

39:52.693 --> 39:54.027
Oh, oh!

39:54.060 --> 39:55.862
Oh. Hi.

40:08.675 --> 40:11.878
What? In the courtroom?

40:11.912 --> 40:16.416
My, my. And Lindsay?

40:17.751 --> 40:21.788
Are you guys coming here
to this hospital?

40:21.822 --> 40:27.127
Well, uh, I don't know
what to say, Bobby.

40:27.160 --> 40:30.130
Congratulations, man.

40:30.163 --> 40:33.133
Uh, she's doing the same.

40:33.166 --> 40:35.101
Well, I'm going to
give her this news.

40:35.135 --> 40:39.205
Maybe that will wake her up.

40:39.239 --> 40:41.441
Okay. See you later.

40:47.814 --> 40:50.951
You're not going to
believe this, Bec.

40:50.984 --> 40:54.020
Bobby and Lindsay
just had a baby boy.

40:54.054 --> 40:57.123
She had him right
in the courtroom.

40:57.157 --> 40:58.725
How about that?

41:01.728 --> 41:04.164
Mysterious ways, huh?

41:29.055 --> 41:31.191
Oh, my.

41:31.224 --> 41:32.292
Are you okay?

41:32.325 --> 41:34.661
I'm fine. Short labor.

41:34.695 --> 41:36.697
-Oh, God, look at him.
-Does he have a name?

41:36.730 --> 41:38.231
Robert.

41:38.264 --> 41:39.800
You named him after you?

41:39.833 --> 41:41.134
What a shock.

41:41.167 --> 41:42.903
Here's my pager.
I'm waiting for a call

41:42.936 --> 41:43.904
from the appeals court.
Any change with Bec?

41:43.937 --> 41:45.539
No.

41:45.572 --> 41:46.707
It's possible that we
can get in tonight.

41:46.740 --> 41:47.841
Where's Ellenor?

41:47.874 --> 41:49.209
-Bobby?
-I'll be right there.

41:49.242 --> 41:51.144
I need you and Ellenor
to get on Westlaw,

41:51.177 --> 41:52.713
see if there's
any new cases.

41:52.746 --> 41:55.616
All our research
is in here.

41:55.649 --> 41:58.719
Her heart rate
is still too high.

41:58.752 --> 42:00.721
Has it gone up anymore?

42:00.754 --> 42:02.122
No, it's still 140,

42:02.155 --> 42:04.858
but that's dangerous,
Mrs. Washington.

42:04.891 --> 42:07.761
But it hasn't
gotten any worse.

42:07.794 --> 42:09.129
No.

42:09.162 --> 42:11.732
Well, there's that then.

42:11.765 --> 42:14.300
Hey, baby.

42:26.913 --> 42:30.016
So, I hear you're
delivering babies now.

42:31.017 --> 42:34.688
No change?
No.

42:34.721 --> 42:35.822
Congratulations.

42:35.856 --> 42:36.990
Thank you.

Lindsay's fine?

42:40.861 --> 42:42.262
Yeah, she's in her room.

42:42.295 --> 42:44.297
You can go up and see her.

42:49.402 --> 42:54.908
Hey, Bec,
you're a Godmother now --

42:54.941 --> 42:58.211
7 pounds, 2 ounces.

43:00.146 --> 43:02.583
Thank you.

43:08.054 --> 43:12.893
Now we just need for you
to wake up.

43:12.926 --> 43:15.161
Would anyone like
to join me in a prayer?

43:40.787 --> 43:42.756

44:04.444 --> 44:06.212
You stinker!
