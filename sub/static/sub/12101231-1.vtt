00:10.706 --> 00:15.015
In ancient days,
gods, demons, and mortal men

00:15.015 --> 00:16.668
walked together on this earth.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.369
In time, their realms
became separate.

00:23.327 --> 00:26.026
Now all that remains
are the legends,

00:29.812 --> 00:31.596
and the keys to their realms.

00:54.141 --> 00:56.317
London, 1381.

01:01.148 --> 01:04.803
Plague and corruption have
spread throughout the land,

01:04.803 --> 01:07.893
and the innocent were taken
to the darkest of places.

01:12.681 --> 01:13.508
Newgate Prison.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.704
Newgate was said to
be like hell on earth.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.227
That's how Tyburn liked it.

01:39.142 --> 01:42.102
Ulrich Tyburn,
Governor of Newgate.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.194
For over 100 years,

01:47.194 --> 01:49.196
Tyburn was governor of
the infamous prison.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.677
- Bring the girl down.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.288
Using the
prisoners as slaves

01:54.288 --> 01:57.552
to carve out passageways
deep below the city.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.781
To a place known only to demons.

02:16.092 --> 02:19.443
Here, they built a great temple

02:19.443 --> 02:22.316
where Tyburn brought
his followers,

02:22.316 --> 02:24.013
Newgate's most evil prisoners

02:25.101 --> 02:27.799
who had sold him their souls,

02:27.799 --> 02:30.019
becoming slaves to his will.

02:33.153 --> 02:37.896
Using an ancient key,
Tyburn opened a doorway,

02:42.074 --> 02:43.815
a doorway to the underworld.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.342
Tyburn wanted to use
the armies of evil

02:48.342 --> 02:51.780
to conquer the world,
and, to free them,

02:51.780 --> 02:53.608
Tyburn had one final task,

02:56.045 --> 02:57.742
the sacrifice of an innocent.

02:59.483 --> 03:00.745
But Tyburn's
impatience had pushed

03:00.745 --> 03:02.443
the people of England too far.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.663
On the day of his
final sacrifice,

03:05.663 --> 03:08.666
a crowd gathered at
Newgate, demanding justice.

03:19.764 --> 03:20.591
- Tyburn!

03:21.723 --> 03:22.550
- You.

04:18.910 --> 04:19.737
- Tyburn!

04:22.262 --> 04:23.480
I have come for the girl.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.614
- Then you are too late.

04:26.614 --> 04:29.269
Soon, she will be dead.

04:30.226 --> 04:31.488
As will you.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.329
Morgan!

06:06.757 --> 06:07.802
- I see.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.283
Tell me more about
this fellow Tyburn.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.721
Do you feel he was to blame

06:13.721 --> 06:15.331
for your attack on Dr. Segalman?

06:17.028 --> 06:19.204
- I never meant to hurt her.

06:19.204 --> 06:21.293
That was a mistake, I was
trying to protect her!

06:21.293 --> 06:22.120
- From what?

06:23.208 --> 06:25.689
- The key, she found the key.

06:25.689 --> 06:26.864
- The key to what?

06:26.864 --> 06:28.562
- Tyburn's key, the key is evil.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.564
They will use it to free Tyburn.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.392
She needs my help!

07:07.078 --> 07:08.515
Kryssie.

07:08.515 --> 07:09.385
- Gregory.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.520
- So good to see you.
- And you.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.608
This is spectacular.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.131
- My London home.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.567
Come on in and I'll
show you around.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.258
Lord Woodrow.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.480
- Good evening.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.830
- This is Dr. Segalman,
the eminent archeologist

08:02.830 --> 08:04.571
who discovered the key.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.224
Kristina, this is Lord Woodrow.

08:06.224 --> 08:08.009
- Pleased to meet you.
- And you.

08:08.009 --> 08:10.794
I've been hearing some
wonderful things about you.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.666
- Lord Woodrow has
been very helpful to us

08:12.666 --> 08:14.581
on getting permission for our
dig beneath the Old Bailey.

08:14.581 --> 08:15.625
- Have you seen the key?

08:15.625 --> 08:17.409
No, not yet.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.194
- Well, look the party
hasn't really livened up yet,

08:19.194 --> 08:21.283
so why don't we take
a sneak preview?

08:25.113 --> 08:26.593
Oh!

08:26.593 --> 08:27.594
Oh, sorry.

08:27.594 --> 08:28.986
- Oh, that's all right.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.510
I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.120
Really should watch
where I'm going.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.556
Sorry, old boy, you okay?

08:33.556 --> 08:35.819
- Lester!
- I'm sorry.

08:35.819 --> 08:36.646
- Kryssie.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.822
- Lester Rossini.

08:40.824 --> 08:41.999
Is Addie around?

08:41.999 --> 08:43.348
- You two know each other?

08:45.133 --> 08:49.006
- Yes, I was engaged to
Lester's brother Addison.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.268
- Addie's not here.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.053
Last I heard, he was in Moscow.

08:52.053 --> 08:54.446
- Wheeling and dealing.
- As always.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.623
- Since when were you
interested in archeology?

08:56.623 --> 08:58.363
- I guess it runs in the blood,

08:58.363 --> 09:00.322
what with Addie so fascinated
with old treasures.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.237
- Yes, as I can remember,
that seemed to be

09:02.237 --> 09:04.848
all Addison was
ever interested in.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.546
- Lord Woodrow, this is Lester.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.809
He's accompanying my
daughter Phoebe at the party.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.114
Has she given you
the slip, old boy?

09:10.114 --> 09:11.289
- Seems that way.

09:11.289 --> 09:12.595
Actually, I better go find her.

09:12.595 --> 09:15.119
It's good to see you again.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.599
- And you.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.349
- Thank you, Gregory.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.985
Where
are you, Lester?

09:56.030 --> 09:58.206
- Lester, darling!

09:58.206 --> 09:59.120
Phoebe.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.166
- Are you going to
ask me to dance?

10:02.166 --> 10:03.603
We've hardly spent any
time together tonight.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.169
- Well, I-

10:05.169 --> 10:07.302
- Come on, Phoebe, stop
pestering the waiter.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.695
I need a dance.

10:10.914 --> 10:11.741
- Waiter?

10:37.462 --> 10:39.682
It's gotta be one of these.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.947
But not that one.

11:06.317 --> 11:07.188
Come on.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.122
- Trouble getting away
from Miss Van Husen?

11:28.122 --> 11:29.950
- Well, what can I say, Addie?

11:29.950 --> 11:33.257
One of us had to have the
old Rossini animal magnetism.

11:33.257 --> 11:34.737
Anyway, I feel like
a cad leading her on.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.391
She's a really nice girl.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.132
- Lester, her daddy's
a billionaire.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.786
Money's on the mind of
every man she meets.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.178
- It'd be nice to be
different for a change,

11:41.178 --> 11:42.092
that's all I'm saying.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.267
- No!

11:43.267 --> 11:44.747
We're here to steal the key.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.531
Her daddy might
care, but she won't.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.621
I can't believe you, Lester.

11:49.621 --> 11:50.448
- I guess.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.277
- Look, our timing's screwed.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.757
We better communicate
by radio now.

11:54.757 --> 11:55.758
Here, this is yours.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.281
- What, do we have to?

11:57.281 --> 11:59.109
I hate having this
thing stuck in my ear.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.720
As if I wasn't uncomfortable
enough wearing this tie.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.069
- Would you stop whinging?

12:06.769 --> 12:09.641
Right, what's that look for?

12:09.641 --> 12:11.208
What look?

12:11.208 --> 12:12.862
- Like I just parked
my car on your foot.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.429
- It's nothing, it's nothing.

12:14.429 --> 12:15.996
What is it?

12:15.996 --> 12:17.519
- Kryssie's here,
she's downstairs.

12:17.519 --> 12:18.999
I know.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.174
I see,
you're okay with that.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.175
- That's ancient history.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.742
We're here to do a job.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.352
- If you say so.

12:24.352 --> 12:26.223
Look, I better be going.

12:26.223 --> 12:27.398
I should return Gregory's
keys before they're missed.

12:27.398 --> 12:28.225
Right, play it cool.

12:28.225 --> 12:29.444
- Cool as ice.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.011
- Lester.
- What?

12:31.011 --> 12:32.055
Your fly's undone.

12:33.361 --> 12:34.449
- Oh, very mature.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.677
- The Key of Khnum.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.157
It's early Egyptian by origin.

12:48.985 --> 12:51.074
The key was brought back here
by knights after the Crusades.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.512
- If you look at
these hieroglyphics,

12:54.512 --> 12:56.776
you will see the
story of the key.

13:02.085 --> 13:06.133
The god Khnum was said to
have given up one of his eyes,

13:06.133 --> 13:10.224
which he fashioned into a
pendant as a gift for Osiris,

13:10.224 --> 13:11.660
the king of the netherworld.

13:13.096 --> 13:16.099
Using the eye, Khnum
tried to spy on Osiris

13:16.099 --> 13:18.319
in a plot to overthrow him,

13:18.319 --> 13:21.801
but Osiris uncovered his
plan, and, in his anger,

13:21.801 --> 13:24.455
trapped Khnum
inside the pendant.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.936
- But the pendant
in these pictures

13:26.936 --> 13:28.111
is different to this-

13:28.111 --> 13:29.809
- Well spotted.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.028
The pendant is
described as existing

13:32.028 --> 13:34.378
of two interlocking pieces.

13:34.378 --> 13:37.425
This part of the key, and
another part called the eye.

13:41.516 --> 13:42.734
How does
all of this lead you

13:42.734 --> 13:44.824
to the dig at the Bailey?

13:46.260 --> 13:48.828
- Well, as you know,
the Old Bailey's built

13:48.828 --> 13:51.482
on the site that was
formerly Newgate Prison.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.835
Recent findings in
Jerusalem suggest

13:55.835 --> 13:58.881
that a prominent figure
from the Knights Templar

13:58.881 --> 14:00.578
fled to England with treasures

14:00.578 --> 14:02.450
that may have included this key,

14:04.147 --> 14:05.279
and took residency here

14:11.459 --> 14:13.765
as governor of Newgate.

14:18.509 --> 14:21.251
C t .

14:23.427 --> 14:24.254
- Kryssie?

14:26.082 --> 14:26.909
Kryssie?

14:28.780 --> 14:30.826
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

14:33.176 --> 14:35.091
We should
be getting back.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.963
The rest of the guests will
surely have arrived by now.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.486
- Of course.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.705
Well, thank you both
for the history lesson.

15:30.712 --> 15:31.539
- Lester!

15:32.627 --> 15:34.324
Well, I'll be, you're growing

15:34.324 --> 15:35.935
more like your father every day,

15:37.980 --> 15:39.634
except you're thinner, paler,

15:43.725 --> 15:44.944
How's that brother of yours?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.119
You know, I always liked him.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.772
- Good to see you again, Major.

15:47.772 --> 15:48.991
Now will you excuse me?

15:48.991 --> 15:51.298
I'd like to-
- Nonsense.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.213
I'm not leaving you
here on your own.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.866
We've got so much to talk about.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.601
They wanted me to be in
charge of the operation.

16:33.601 --> 16:36.778
Times of action require men,

16:36.778 --> 16:40.477
not some fatheaded windbag,
full of his own importance.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.566
- Oh, yes, sir, real men.

17:45.586 --> 17:48.719
Not only were
all the gloves strewn,

17:48.719 --> 17:50.939
but the monkey had
to be destroyed.

17:52.636 --> 17:55.987
However, it was only
after I became suspicious

17:55.987 --> 17:57.859
that I discovered Lester here

17:57.859 --> 18:02.646
under his father's banana
tree, stark naked.

18:04.387 --> 18:05.997
Sir, we're
running low on champagne.

18:05.997 --> 18:08.261
May I have the keys for
the wine cellar, please?

18:08.261 --> 18:10.567
Oh, yes, of
course, I'll just get the key.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.005
- Phoebe, how about that dance?

18:15.529 --> 18:16.965
- Oh, bugger all.
- I'm so sorry.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.401
- Oh, sorry, Daddy.
- What luck.

18:18.401 --> 18:19.576
- Okay, old boy?
- That's okay, Lester.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.056
That's great, thank you, Lester.

18:22.536 --> 18:23.363
Excuse me.
- Sorry.

18:34.243 --> 18:35.375
I'll call you tomorrow.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.378
- Make sure you call me.

18:41.555 --> 18:42.382
- Can I borrow your car?

19:30.343 --> 19:31.170
- Lester?

19:34.434 --> 19:36.305
Fine, don't worry,
I've got the goods.

19:36.305 --> 19:37.350
On my way out.

21:21.715 --> 21:22.803
- Addie.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.253
- Right, we've got
him trapped now.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.299
Send the rest of the team.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.324
Get up there!

22:35.092 --> 22:38.052
- Ow!

22:45.059 --> 22:46.016
Kryssie?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.806
I haven't got time for this.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.373
- Then give me the key.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.548
- You know Julian's got it.

22:55.548 --> 22:57.680
If you want it, come and get it.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.160
- Fine.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.646
- Stop, just stop!

23:15.698 --> 23:17.700
- Stop or they'll shoot.

23:19.659 --> 23:21.138
- Thanks for the workout.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.139
- Drop dead.

23:23.924 --> 23:26.970
- Put the key on the floor
and your hands on your head.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.972
- Is that what you want?

23:30.060 --> 23:30.887
This?

24:23.462 --> 24:24.593
- Damn it!

24:35.996 --> 24:37.476
- What happened?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.347
- Slight deviation
from the original plan.

24:39.347 --> 24:41.088
- Yeah, I'd say.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.872
What about him?

24:42.872 --> 24:44.352
- He'll wake up with a headache.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.963
- Good show, we've got it.

24:48.138 --> 24:49.139
- Of course.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.320
What do you think?

24:56.320 --> 24:57.408
- Is that it?

25:00.324 --> 25:02.370
I wouldn't buy it.

25:02.370 --> 25:03.980
- Well, I want
you to deliver it.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.678
On my own?

25:05.678 --> 25:06.853
- All those years
of public school

25:06.853 --> 25:09.246
education, Lester, wasted.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.944
Yes, on your own.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.033
We're talking about a
million apiece here.

25:15.731 --> 25:16.558
- I suppose.

25:20.997 --> 25:23.260
- Like I said, all
those wasted years.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.087
- What?

25:30.616 --> 25:31.530
Right.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.708
- Still don't understand why
they need me to do the drop.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.536
- Take a left at
the fifth floor,

25:37.536 --> 25:39.494
third door on the left,
they'll meet you there.

25:39.494 --> 25:42.410
The contact name is Francis.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.977
- Francis.

25:43.977 --> 25:44.804
Got it.

25:46.283 --> 25:47.110
- Good luck.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.310
- Mr. Rossini.
- Yes?

26:16.575 --> 26:17.619
- You're on your own.

26:19.099 --> 26:21.580
I thought your brother
was supposed to join us.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.146
- He was?

26:23.146 --> 26:24.757
Yeah, he was.

26:26.628 --> 26:27.498
That case for me?

26:29.065 --> 26:30.632
- Yes.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.292
Don't you have something for me?

26:39.859 --> 26:40.686
- Oh, yeah.

26:42.688 --> 26:43.558
I nearly forgot.

26:50.347 --> 26:52.436
- Please, please, please.

26:54.134 --> 26:54.961
No, no.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.617
Please, no.

27:03.752 --> 27:04.623
- I'll take that.

27:20.116 --> 27:21.291
Get the cases.

27:26.340 --> 27:30.039
The car's out front,
I'll see you down there.

27:32.651 --> 27:37.307
- You'll never get out of
this building alive, you know.

28:05.858 --> 28:06.989
- Nice tie.

28:19.567 --> 28:20.699
- Get the car.

28:27.401 --> 28:28.968
- What the hell
were you thinking

28:28.968 --> 28:31.100
sending me in there
on my own like that?

28:31.100 --> 28:33.407
- I haven't got time to
explain that to you, Lester.

28:41.807 --> 28:42.721
Uh oh.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.591
- What?

29:01.478 --> 29:02.741
- Hold on tight.

29:12.446 --> 29:13.752
- That'll hurt his pay book.

29:30.420 --> 29:31.508
- Take that.

29:31.508 --> 29:32.509
- What for?

29:32.509 --> 29:34.163
- Take a wild guess.

29:34.163 --> 29:35.164
- All right!

29:42.955 --> 29:43.956
- Look out!

29:50.527 --> 29:52.355
- That's good shooting,
give that back to me.

30:31.612 --> 30:32.439
Morning.

30:32.439 --> 30:33.614
- Morning.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.050
Better get to work inside.

30:35.050 --> 30:36.225
The city engineers
have been on the phone.

30:36.225 --> 30:37.836
They're on their way down,

30:37.836 --> 30:40.142
and they may want to
close down the dig.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.492
- Can they do not?
- Oh, yes.

31:39.158 --> 31:41.116
- What way is this?

31:41.116 --> 31:44.380
It just keeps going
down and down and down.

33:35.839 --> 33:37.667
The body of the stone.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.594
200,000
pounds, it's all yours.

33:51.594 --> 33:53.205
- What, all of it?

33:53.205 --> 33:55.033
All of it.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.732
And a new passport, and details
of a new home in Valencia.

33:58.732 --> 34:00.299
- Valencia?

34:00.299 --> 34:01.952
What's going on, Add?

34:05.391 --> 34:07.349
- We're in over our heads
on this one, Lester.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.177
I shouldn't have
got you involved.

34:09.177 --> 34:12.093
It's my fault, I'm sorry, but
you have to leave tonight.

34:12.093 --> 34:14.095
- I can't just leave.

34:14.095 --> 34:17.055
- We're dealing
with professionals,
professional killers!

34:17.055 --> 34:19.144
They never intended to pay us.

34:19.144 --> 34:21.711
They wanted this trinket
and then us dead.

34:21.711 --> 34:23.365
Now, you have to leave tonight.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.151
Don't call Phoebe,
don't call anyone.

34:26.151 --> 34:27.413
Do you understand me?

34:27.413 --> 34:28.240
- Yeah.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.068
Yeah.

34:32.070 --> 34:32.896
- I'm sorry.

34:34.028 --> 34:39.033
I really am.

34:44.734 --> 34:46.867
- It doesn't look so bad now.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.869
I almost like the place.

35:04.493 --> 35:05.581
Five holes.

35:08.889 --> 35:11.761
Looks like some sort of
key is needed to open it.

35:11.761 --> 35:13.676
- Like the one we've lost.

35:15.765 --> 35:16.853
- Never mind.

35:21.031 --> 35:22.163
- Mr. Rossini.

35:23.947 --> 35:25.471
We have somebody here
that you might recognize.

35:30.693 --> 35:33.131
Of course you do, it's
your brother Lester.

35:35.089 --> 35:37.874
We have a proposition
for you, Mr. Rossini.

35:37.874 --> 35:39.137
You'll carry out
another robbery,

35:39.137 --> 35:40.529
and I'll be half this time.

35:42.009 --> 35:44.098
This is the item in question.

35:44.098 --> 35:45.665
A jewel-encrusted golden eye,

35:45.665 --> 35:47.710
currently in the care
of the British Museum.

35:49.364 --> 35:51.758
You'll find a building
layout, security arrangements,

35:51.758 --> 35:53.499
everything you need
for the successful

35:53.499 --> 35:56.371
planning of this operation
here on this desk.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.157
But I wouldn't spend too
long thinking about it

35:59.157 --> 36:01.289
if I were you, Mr. Rossini.

36:01.289 --> 36:04.249
You see, we're working to
rather a tight deadline.

36:05.859 --> 36:09.079
My employer needs
both the jeweled eye

36:09.079 --> 36:12.213
and that key you so skillfully
acquired the other night

36:12.213 --> 36:13.954
by dawn tomorrow.

36:13.954 --> 36:16.826
Now, if you fail to do this,

36:19.525 --> 36:21.396
things could go badly
for Lester here.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.183
- Sorry, Addie.

36:27.881 --> 36:32.712
Very badly, indeed.

36:45.420 --> 36:46.769
- Brother Sabec.

36:47.901 --> 36:48.989
- It is time.

37:41.128 --> 37:43.130
- You're looking well, Doctor.

37:43.130 --> 37:46.394
I'm not here to harm you,
but I will if I have to.

37:52.966 --> 37:54.533
- I know you think you're
here to save us all, but-

37:54.533 --> 37:55.708
- If the amulet falls
into the wrong hands,

37:55.708 --> 37:58.101
no one will be able to save us.

37:58.101 --> 37:59.886
- Please, don't go and make
things worse for yourself.

37:59.886 --> 38:02.715
- Things could get a lot
worse for both of us, Kryssie.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.586
Ow.

38:47.586 --> 38:48.587
- Addie?

40:00.615 --> 40:02.356
- The news isn't good, brothers.

40:02.356 --> 40:03.923
What about the eye?

40:03.923 --> 40:05.359
- Someone has intercepted it,

40:05.359 --> 40:07.230
but don't despair just yet.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.537
Brother Sabec has tracked
it down and is watching.

40:09.537 --> 40:10.712
We
should just kill him.

40:10.712 --> 40:12.453
- Patience, Brother.

40:12.453 --> 40:14.107
We don't know what his
motives are or what he intends

40:14.107 --> 40:17.066
to do with it.

40:27.337 --> 40:28.687
The time to act is upon us.

40:57.759 --> 40:59.195
- Hello, Francis.

41:00.196 --> 41:01.502
Guns down, down.

41:02.895 --> 41:05.550
- All of ya, put your guns down.

41:07.813 --> 41:10.337
- Where's my brother?

41:10.337 --> 41:11.338
Where is he?

41:12.687 --> 41:15.473
- Have you got something
for me, Rossini?

41:15.473 --> 41:17.213
- My brother first.

41:43.718 --> 41:46.112
You all right, Lester?

41:46.112 --> 41:46.939
- Yeah.

42:13.966 --> 42:15.315
Call me.

42:18.623 --> 42:21.364
I don't think so.

42:21.364 --> 42:22.714
- What are you doing here?

42:22.714 --> 42:24.237
Retrieving
stolen goods.

42:30.417 --> 42:31.244
- No!

42:32.767 --> 42:33.594
Stop!

42:35.814 --> 42:37.816
Put the gun down, Dr. Segalman.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.733
You were never meant
to be involved in this.

42:43.169 --> 42:45.084
- But why?

42:45.084 --> 42:47.521
- The treasure, Kristina,
the treasure of Templars.

42:48.914 --> 42:51.786
With this key, I can
open the secret chamber,

42:51.786 --> 42:53.309
have it all!

43:03.189 --> 43:04.364
- Get in the car!

43:23.862 --> 43:25.037
- Where's she going?

43:30.695 --> 43:31.870
Get to the cars.

44:25.140 --> 44:27.012
Lester, you okay?

44:27.012 --> 44:29.057
- I'm okay, are you okay?

44:31.712 --> 44:32.974
- I'm okay.

44:48.903 --> 44:50.296
Come on, hurry up!

44:50.296 --> 44:51.993
- I'm trying!
- Hurry up!

44:54.517 --> 44:55.867
- I got it!

45:15.582 --> 45:17.192
- If I don't get
to the Old Bailey,

45:17.192 --> 45:20.239
it'll be an unimaginable
catastrophe.

45:20.239 --> 45:21.370
Only I can stop it.

45:22.807 --> 45:23.982
- Are we going to
listen to this?

45:23.982 --> 45:25.723
This man is a mental patient.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.202
He stabbed me!

45:27.202 --> 45:28.726
Look!

45:28.726 --> 45:29.901
- Yeah, well, I felt
like stabbing you

45:29.901 --> 45:30.423
on more than one occasion.

45:31.511 --> 45:33.426
Now, listen, old man, all I want

45:33.426 --> 45:34.862
is the money that's owed to me.

45:34.862 --> 45:36.559
Maybe, as a bonus, get even

45:36.559 --> 45:38.736
with this Woodrow guy,
whatever his name is.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.827
I don't
like the sound of that.

45:42.827 --> 45:45.830
- Why are you hanging
around with these people?

45:45.830 --> 45:47.396
They will not help us.

45:47.396 --> 45:50.269
- Oi, I never asked
you to tag along.

45:50.269 --> 45:51.749
If we hadn't stopped
to collect you,

45:51.749 --> 45:54.969
you would've been shot,
or barbecued by now.

45:54.969 --> 45:56.492
- Time is running out.

45:56.492 --> 45:58.364
The demon will
soon have the key,

45:58.364 --> 46:00.496
and if he uses it
to open the door,

46:00.496 --> 46:03.935
he will release a curse
upon the whole of mankind.

46:03.935 --> 46:04.762
- What door?

46:06.241 --> 46:08.548
- A doorway to hell,
constructed by Tyburn.

46:10.811 --> 46:12.465
- Tyburn?

46:12.465 --> 46:14.119
- Ulrich Tyburn,

46:14.119 --> 46:16.686
a Knight Templar of
the First Crusade.

46:18.471 --> 46:20.865
When the Christian forces
of the West took Jerusalem,

46:22.344 --> 46:24.520
a desperate search began
for religious relics.

46:25.870 --> 46:28.046
Under the Temple of Solomon,

46:28.046 --> 46:30.613
we found treasures
beyond the imagination.

46:32.398 --> 46:36.315
Amongst these treasures was
a cup, the cup of Christ,

46:39.013 --> 46:40.058
the Holy Grail.

46:43.757 --> 46:46.281
But Tyburn had found
something else in the chamber,

46:48.109 --> 46:51.330
an ancient key from a
world long forgotten.

46:54.637 --> 46:56.683
In a ceremony at the
Temple of Solomon,

46:57.858 --> 46:59.425
we drank from the Grail,

47:04.038 --> 47:05.213
and, in doing so,

47:10.610 --> 47:11.829
received the gift

47:15.615 --> 47:16.616
of life eternal.

47:21.403 --> 47:24.580
But Tyburn's key was
cursed by an evil demon.

47:27.235 --> 47:31.631
It possessed his body
and poisoned his soul.

47:36.549 --> 47:40.118
Tyburn must rid himself of all
traces of his own humanity.

47:40.118 --> 47:42.903
In 1381, I saved his
own granddaughter

47:42.903 --> 47:44.600
from a death at his hands.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.733
Once again, he seeks his heir,

47:46.733 --> 47:49.431
the last of his
direct descendants.

47:49.431 --> 47:50.563
You, Kryssie.

47:52.173 --> 47:53.174
- What?

47:53.174 --> 47:53.871
- This is absurd.

47:55.611 --> 47:57.875
- There is a birthmark
on the back of your neck.

47:59.093 --> 48:00.573
Your mother had the same mark,

48:00.573 --> 48:02.792
as did her mother before her.

48:02.792 --> 48:04.316
- Right, enough!

48:04.316 --> 48:06.274
Woodrow and Francis
are at the Old Bailey.

48:07.667 --> 48:08.668
- Yes, I know.
- Well, that's where

48:08.668 --> 48:10.235
we're all headed.

48:10.235 --> 48:12.237
- I'm going to the
police, Addison.

48:12.237 --> 48:14.674
Do as you please.

48:21.115 --> 48:22.203
- No, let go!

48:34.041 --> 48:37.088
- All my life, I've
dreamt of the treasure

48:37.088 --> 48:40.265
of the Templars,
and, now, here it is.

49:15.474 --> 49:17.215
My God, it's amazing.

49:24.744 --> 49:28.878
Where's the treasure,
where's the treasure?

49:28.878 --> 49:30.750
Where is the treasure?

49:52.685 --> 49:54.513
- Cowardly mannered.

49:54.513 --> 49:57.081
I could smell your
fear as you slithered

50:07.004 --> 50:09.093
- We have long awaited
your return, Master.

50:11.051 --> 50:13.445
Your servants
await your command.

50:21.627 --> 50:22.454
- Stand.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.720
There is much to do.

50:29.678 --> 50:30.940
They'll
be in there now.

50:30.940 --> 50:32.681
Quickly, there's
no time to lose!

50:33.900 --> 50:35.032
- You all right in there?

50:35.032 --> 50:36.033
Let me out, you!

50:37.425 --> 50:38.731
- That's nice.

50:38.731 --> 50:39.993
Won't be long, honey.

50:39.993 --> 50:43.257
Just, yeah.
- How long?

50:48.480 --> 50:50.873
- Stay up here and
keep your eyes open.

50:50.873 --> 50:52.005
- Fine by me.

51:01.275 --> 51:02.972
- Where is he going?

51:06.063 --> 51:07.151
Where's he gone?

51:14.158 --> 51:16.421
- Where's the girl Kryssie?

51:17.813 --> 51:20.164
- She's behind you.
- Very funny.

51:21.078 --> 51:23.123
You're so dead.

51:36.049 --> 51:37.703
- How'd you get out of the boot?

51:37.703 --> 51:38.878
- Unlocked it.

51:46.146 --> 51:49.454
- No, Kryssie, get
out of here, now!

51:51.804 --> 51:53.980
There's no time, he can
sense your presence.

51:53.980 --> 51:55.982
Quickly, get out,
get her out of here!

51:55.982 --> 51:57.984
- Let's go, now!

51:57.984 --> 51:59.768
- Keep her safe
at all costs, go!

52:07.428 --> 52:09.952
- My old friend Morgan.

52:12.607 --> 52:15.480
So you've been waiting
for me all these years.

52:16.611 --> 52:17.438
Pathetic.

52:20.702 --> 52:25.707
You can't defeat me,
old man.

52:43.203 --> 52:44.987
We must
get her to safety.

52:44.987 --> 52:46.163
- It's locked!

52:47.686 --> 52:49.427
- Open the door!

52:53.996 --> 52:58.914
- Minion of darkness,
condemned souls of Newgate,

52:58.914 --> 53:02.266
servants of darkness bound
by your souls, hear me.

53:03.528 --> 53:04.355
Arise!

53:09.664 --> 53:11.579
- Open the door!

53:11.579 --> 53:13.320
- I've already tried.

53:24.244 --> 53:27.856
- Kill the men, bring
me the girl alive.

53:36.343 --> 53:37.562
- The servants of darkness?

53:37.562 --> 53:39.346
- That's my guess.

53:39.346 --> 53:40.608
Lester, open the door!

53:48.050 --> 53:49.269
- Don't worry,
Addie, I'm coming.

53:49.269 --> 53:51.358
- Lester, open the door.

53:53.273 --> 53:55.667
- Les, open the door!

53:55.667 --> 53:57.016
God.

54:02.282 --> 54:05.459
- Tyburn, Tyburn, turn around.

54:05.459 --> 54:06.286
Face me.

54:11.944 --> 54:16.253
Lester, open the door!

54:16.253 --> 54:18.167
- I'm trying, I really am!

54:52.419 --> 54:53.551
- Add, up there.

54:57.076 --> 54:58.120
- Looks good to me.

55:06.999 --> 55:07.869
Not bad.

55:20.578 --> 55:21.579
- No, Sabec!

55:31.110 --> 55:34.896
- It's not gonna
hold them for long.

55:34.896 --> 55:36.071
Where are you going?

55:36.071 --> 55:37.290
- This is the quickest way out.

55:50.956 --> 55:51.783
Now what?

55:54.438 --> 55:55.352
- Come on.

56:02.533 --> 56:05.318
- Don't worry,
Addie, I'm coming!

56:07.494 --> 56:08.756
What are you doing,
where's Addie?

56:08.756 --> 56:10.367
- They found another way out.

56:10.367 --> 56:11.498
- Well, where's your friend?

56:11.498 --> 56:12.804
And who's this behind the door?

56:23.249 --> 56:26.383
- They're all locked,
what are we gonna do?

56:26.383 --> 56:27.645
- I'm thinking.

56:31.039 --> 56:32.345
- Come on!

56:32.345 --> 56:33.955
- Thinking.

56:33.955 --> 56:35.043
- Well, hurry!

56:36.784 --> 56:38.046
- I'm thinking.

56:46.490 --> 56:47.578
Where am I?

56:53.627 --> 56:54.802
Hold that door for a minute.

56:54.802 --> 56:56.238
- What?

56:56.238 --> 56:58.153
- Hold the door!
- What?

57:06.379 --> 57:08.076
- Good, that's good.

57:14.953 --> 57:17.956
- Good thinking,
Einstein, we're trapped.

57:19.436 --> 57:21.350
Tell me you have a plan
to get us out of here.

57:21.350 --> 57:22.830
- Not yet.

57:22.830 --> 57:24.397
Well, hurry up!

57:45.244 --> 57:46.375
- Ah!

57:53.252 --> 57:54.732
I've got it!

57:57.735 --> 57:58.823
Tie this around your waist.

57:58.823 --> 58:00.389
- What are you doing?

58:00.389 --> 58:01.521
- I'm going to lower you
down to the pavement.

58:01.521 --> 58:02.696
Are you insane?

58:02.696 --> 58:05.003
- Have you got a better idea?

58:06.091 --> 58:07.484
Kryssie, we haven't got all day!

58:07.484 --> 58:09.964
Okay, okay, okay.

58:13.968 --> 58:15.883
- Okay, careful, careful.

58:21.715 --> 58:23.151
- What about you?

58:24.239 --> 58:26.067
- I've got a plan for me.

58:28.940 --> 58:31.290
- I'm not going without you.

58:32.334 --> 58:34.380
- Oh, yes, you are.

58:34.380 --> 58:36.034
Go!

58:59.274 --> 59:00.928
Addie, help!

59:00.928 --> 59:01.799
No!

59:25.692 --> 59:28.216
- Leave him, he's mine!

59:39.576 --> 59:40.489
No, no, no!

59:42.535 --> 59:44.276
Bring them to me!

59:44.276 --> 59:46.017
Bring them to me now!

59:50.412 --> 59:51.936
- What are you doing?

59:51.936 --> 59:53.241
We have to go back,
we have to help them.

59:53.241 --> 59:55.896
- Go back, I'm not stopping you.

59:55.896 --> 59:57.158
- Fine, I will.

1:00:02.599 --> 1:00:04.426
You're sure you're not coming?

1:00:04.426 --> 1:00:08.343
- I'll help, but I think
we need to get armed first.

1:00:09.823 --> 1:00:12.826
- What did I do to
deserve you again?

1:00:12.826 --> 1:00:15.437
- Why, you pigheaded, son of a!

1:00:17.483 --> 1:00:20.442
You steal my relics,
you lock me in a trunk,

1:00:20.442 --> 1:00:22.314
throw me out the window!

1:00:22.314 --> 1:00:23.663
- Would you just calm down?

1:00:27.232 --> 1:00:29.060
I'm gonna make a call.

1:00:42.073 --> 1:00:43.204
- Hello?

1:00:43.204 --> 1:00:44.379
- Lester.
- Where are you?

1:00:44.379 --> 1:00:45.685
- Yeah, we're on Suffix Street.

1:00:47.731 --> 1:00:49.733
- No problem, the cavalry
will be there in 10 minutes.

1:00:49.733 --> 1:00:51.560
Just hold on.

1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:53.650
- Carrying it like that,
you'll shoot the wrong person.

1:01:02.093 --> 1:01:02.920
- Don't look!

1:01:17.499 --> 1:01:18.326
Hang on!

1:01:35.343 --> 1:01:37.432
No, get off!

1:01:38.912 --> 1:01:40.697
Get it off,
get it off, get it off!

1:01:43.351 --> 1:01:44.222
Get him off!

1:02:32.096 --> 1:02:33.140
Hold on tight.

1:04:58.416 --> 1:05:00.418
- We're trapped!

1:05:06.119 --> 1:05:07.642
Addie, help, help!

1:05:11.603 --> 1:05:13.039
Addie, help!

1:05:41.502 --> 1:05:42.721
Back, back!

1:05:51.251 --> 1:05:52.949
- Now we're trapped.

1:06:02.959 --> 1:06:05.178
- There's no men after all.

1:06:07.224 --> 1:06:08.138
Come to me.

1:06:10.705 --> 1:06:12.620
- No!
- Kristina!

1:06:12.620 --> 1:06:14.535
- Addie!
- Kristina, no!

1:06:23.022 --> 1:06:25.155
- Oh, how touching.

1:06:25.155 --> 1:06:25.982
Kill him.

1:07:04.672 --> 1:07:05.630
- Are we done yet?

1:07:20.384 --> 1:07:21.776
I hate cashews.

1:07:22.951 --> 1:07:23.952
- Where is Kryssie?

1:07:23.952 --> 1:07:25.606
- They've taken her.

1:07:25.606 --> 1:07:27.695
- Then we must get her back.

1:07:27.695 --> 1:07:32.265
If Tyburn sacrifices Kristina,
it will complete his plan.

1:07:32.265 --> 1:07:34.441
Then the armies of evil
will consume the world,

1:07:34.441 --> 1:07:36.356
and all will be lost.

1:07:36.356 --> 1:07:37.531
- What are those things?

1:07:37.531 --> 1:07:39.055
This is holy water.

1:07:39.055 --> 1:07:40.665
I can use it to
injure the enemy.

1:07:40.665 --> 1:07:42.406
It burns them like
concentrated acid.

1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:46.888
- Great, well, bottle
one for me, will you?

1:07:46.888 --> 1:07:48.629
- So what's the plan?

1:07:49.717 --> 1:07:51.197
- There's another way in,

1:07:51.197 --> 1:07:53.069
a secret passage
into the catacombs,

1:07:53.069 --> 1:07:55.114
hidden beneath the
floor of this church.

1:07:56.115 --> 1:07:57.551
We sealed it in 1381.

1:07:59.336 --> 1:08:02.817
Sabec and his men reopened it
when Kristina found the key.

1:08:02.817 --> 1:08:04.558
- And once we're in?

1:08:04.558 --> 1:08:07.779
- We must send Tyburn through
the doorway into hell.

1:08:07.779 --> 1:08:09.520
- Oh, how, Morgan?

1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:11.565
- Until Tyburn
completes his ceremony

1:08:11.565 --> 1:08:14.612
and makes his sacrifice,
the forces of evil

1:08:14.612 --> 1:08:18.485
will be unable to break free
from their world into our own.

1:08:18.485 --> 1:08:20.835
Tyburn is now one
of these creatures,

1:08:20.835 --> 1:08:22.272
a demon, a beast of Satan.

1:08:23.664 --> 1:08:25.536
If we can force Tyburn
through the door

1:08:25.536 --> 1:08:29.148
before he kills Kryssie, he
will be trapped like the others,

1:08:29.148 --> 1:08:30.106
unable to escape.

1:08:31.368 --> 1:08:32.195
- Right.

1:08:33.239 --> 1:08:34.110
Let's go.

1:08:47.906 --> 1:08:49.473
- He escaped us, sir.

1:08:49.473 --> 1:08:52.215
- Well, then, what
are you doing here?

1:08:54.521 --> 1:08:57.350
It would seem that I have
overestimated your usefulness.

1:08:59.265 --> 1:09:00.919
I have no further use for you.

1:09:03.922 --> 1:09:05.402
Please,
don't kill me!

1:09:05.402 --> 1:09:06.925
- Then give me your soul.

1:09:11.582 --> 1:09:13.149
I want it.

1:09:19.372 --> 1:09:21.853
- Welcome to Newgate.

1:09:28.294 --> 1:09:28.947
- Here it is, help me
with this, will you?

1:09:34.561 --> 1:09:36.259
Hold this for me,
will you, Lester?

1:09:36.259 --> 1:09:37.434
- What is it?

1:09:37.434 --> 1:09:39.175
- It's yours if I don't return.

1:09:39.175 --> 1:09:40.306
- While we're down
there, you keep

1:09:40.306 --> 1:09:41.177
watching the main entrance.

1:09:41.177 --> 1:09:42.743
- No problem.

1:09:42.743 --> 1:09:43.918
- Don't go being a
hero, do you hear?

1:09:43.918 --> 1:09:46.399
You know me, Addie.

1:09:46.399 --> 1:09:49.881
Stop
it, no, stop it!

1:10:04.243 --> 1:10:05.157
- It stinks.

1:10:28.615 --> 1:10:30.878
- Spooky churchyard, night.

1:10:33.185 --> 1:10:35.796
I just need to get a grip.

1:10:35.796 --> 1:10:36.623
Oh, man.

1:11:29.763 --> 1:11:33.506
Now I've got you.

1:11:34.855 --> 1:11:36.074
- Don't be afraid.

1:11:37.858 --> 1:11:41.645
With the taking of your life,
everything will be changed.

1:11:41.645 --> 1:11:44.735
- I'll see you in hell, first.

1:11:44.735 --> 1:11:45.997
- Oh, without doubt.

1:12:16.419 --> 1:12:18.334
With this flame of
life extinguished,

1:12:20.248 --> 1:12:22.947
let total darkness
consume this world.

1:12:24.514 --> 1:12:26.559
My sacred task complete,

1:12:28.126 --> 1:12:31.085
bring me your armies
of eternal damnation!

1:13:53.167 --> 1:13:56.693
You're too late, Morgan, you
should not have come here.

1:14:04.614 --> 1:14:06.006
- Kryssie!

1:14:10.533 --> 1:14:11.534
- Kill them.

1:14:30.335 --> 1:14:32.468
- Addie, help, help!

1:15:30.003 --> 1:15:31.265
- Morgan!

1:15:39.883 --> 1:15:43.887
How long did you leave me in
this temple to rot, Morgan?

1:15:43.887 --> 1:15:46.411
In all that time, I
thought of a million ways

1:15:46.411 --> 1:15:47.891
in which to make you suffer.

1:15:49.414 --> 1:15:52.548
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

1:15:54.027 --> 1:15:56.464
- A mistake I will
not be making twice.

1:16:01.992 --> 1:16:04.516
- Addie, Addie, up here!

1:16:43.729 --> 1:16:45.731
- You have lost, Morgan.

1:16:47.385 --> 1:16:50.344
But I'm not going to
kill you quite just yet.

1:16:50.344 --> 1:16:55.349
Firstly, I want you to watch
as your friends die one by one.

1:17:01.268 --> 1:17:03.270
Watch them!

1:17:21.027 --> 1:17:22.463
- Holy water, anyone?

1:17:35.868 --> 1:17:38.610
- What are you
waiting for, stop him!

1:17:40.656 --> 1:17:42.353
- Addie, help!

1:17:45.399 --> 1:17:46.618
- Thank you, my son.

1:17:55.671 --> 1:17:56.889
- Idiot!

1:18:01.415 --> 1:18:02.895
- Lester, free Kryssie.

1:18:03.896 --> 1:18:05.681
No problem.

1:18:24.090 --> 1:18:27.485
- You have stood in my
way for the last time.

1:18:41.629 --> 1:18:44.458
- To hell with you, Tyburn.

1:18:56.427 --> 1:18:57.254
Oh, crap.

1:18:58.734 --> 1:19:02.694
- I think you need
a refill.

1:19:08.744 --> 1:19:11.485
Your deaths will
be slow, indeed.

1:19:34.465 --> 1:19:37.076
- Turn around, Tyburn.

1:19:48.566 --> 1:19:50.568
Well, what are you waiting for?

1:19:50.568 --> 1:19:51.874
Come and get me.

1:19:56.008 --> 1:19:57.096
- As you wish.

1:20:05.496 --> 1:20:06.323
No!

1:20:07.237 --> 1:20:08.238
- Kryssie!

1:20:08.238 --> 1:20:09.674
No, no!

1:20:16.246 --> 1:20:17.290
- Take my hand.

1:20:49.714 --> 1:20:51.716
- Let go of her, Ulrich.

1:20:54.240 --> 1:20:55.067
- Morgan!

1:21:14.043 --> 1:21:16.480
This place
is collapsing, let's go!

1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:17.916
Lester, come on!

1:22:12.884 --> 1:22:15.887
- There's nothing
you could've done.

1:22:17.454 --> 1:22:18.324
- I know.

1:22:28.595 --> 1:22:30.902
- Leave him to
it, he'll be okay.

1:22:44.350 --> 1:22:45.612
- So, now what?

1:22:48.354 --> 1:22:50.269
- Well, unless you
wanna get on a soapbox

1:22:50.269 --> 1:22:52.532
and explain all this,
I suggest we get going.

1:22:53.620 --> 1:22:54.970
- That's not what I meant.

1:22:56.014 --> 1:22:59.278
- What do you wanna do, tidy up?

1:23:02.151 --> 1:23:02.978
What?

1:23:04.805 --> 1:23:05.937
What?

1:23:10.986 --> 1:23:13.684
- Hey, Addie, there
is a treasure.

1:23:13.684 --> 1:23:15.599
According to Morgan's
book, it was buried

1:23:15.599 --> 1:23:19.559
500 years ago in a chamber
under Threadneedle Street.

1:23:20.952 --> 1:23:23.607
I wonder what's at
Threadneedle Street now.
