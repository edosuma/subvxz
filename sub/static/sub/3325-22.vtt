00:01.043 --> 00:02.249
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:02.420 --> 00:04.376
I almost bled out on a lacrosse field.

00:06.466 --> 00:08.707
Is he in pain?
I thought he'd be healing by now.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.882
You'll be giving power
back to the Nemelon.

00:11.095 --> 00:14.883
The nogitsune
feeds off chaos, strife, and pain.

00:15.099 --> 00:17.055
I need you to help me stop him.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.596
He is nogitsune now.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.564
You want to handcuff me?

00:34.827 --> 00:36.658
If my son is still here,

00:37.747 --> 00:40.705
if there's still a part of him
standing here in front of me,

00:41.250 --> 00:44.037
then he'll put these on willingly
and he'll come with me,

00:44.837 --> 00:46.452
because he knows

00:48.633 --> 00:49.873
I'm here to protect him

00:50.676 --> 00:53.543
from himself and from others.

01:20.706 --> 01:21.912
You're not my son.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.703
Argent, listen to me. Don't do this.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.702
Why not? I've done it before.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.617
Werewolves, berserkers.

02:08.838 --> 02:10.920
I can easily add a nogitsune to the list.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.676
You're not going to shoot my son.

02:17.847 --> 02:19.212
You said it yourself, Sheriff.

02:20.516 --> 02:21.801
That's not your son.

02:22.602 --> 02:23.808
Put it down.

02:25.730 --> 02:26.719
Put it down.

02:26.939 --> 02:29.021
Dad, he's going to shoot me.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.859
He's going to kill me, Dad.

02:31.027 --> 02:32.062
Don't listen.

02:32.278 --> 02:33.688
Put it down.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.398
Now! Do it!

02:35.823 --> 02:36.903
Put it down!

02:37.116 --> 02:38.322
Pull the trigger. Come on.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.445
Listen to me,
you put the gun down now!

02:40.661 --> 02:41.901
- Shoot me.
- Dad.

02:42.121 --> 02:43.110
- Shoot me!
- Put the gun down!

02:43.289 --> 02:45.029
- Shoot me!
- Argent, you put it down!

02:45.416 --> 02:47.873
- Strife.
- Put it down! Put it down!

02:51.005 --> 02:52.245
Put it down!

02:59.305 --> 03:01.967
Stop, stop it! This is what he wants.
This is exactly what he wants.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.218
Not exactly.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.471
l was kind of hoping Scott would be here.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.311
But I'm glad you all have your guns out.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.775
But you're not here to kill me.

03:16.447 --> 03:18.153
You're here to protect me.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.470
What happened?

04:33.691 --> 04:34.771
They disappeared.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.266
They literally just vanished.

04:39.405 --> 04:41.020
And so did Stiles.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.182
Why that kanji?

05:22.531 --> 05:23.737
Why "self"?

05:24.742 --> 05:27.449
To signify that he died as himself.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.744
Because Rhys wasn't a monster.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.657
Not like you.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.788
If I'm such a monster,

05:37.671 --> 05:39.753
why'd you call off the oni?

05:40.299 --> 05:42.164
What happened
to the woman who called out

05:42.384 --> 05:47.424
for chaos, strife and pain
to descend upon everyone and everything?

05:47.640 --> 05:48.971
What happened?

05:50.226 --> 05:51.432
I don't want that anymore.

05:52.061 --> 05:53.176
I do.

05:56.440 --> 06:00.149
Did you bring this here
thinking you could hide it from me?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.020
Bad idea.

06:16.836 --> 06:17.951
What have you done?

06:43.362 --> 06:45.148
Chaos is come again.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.629
Thanks for letting me stay.

07:49.845 --> 07:52.211
| just didn't want to go home yet.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.933
| feel like I don't even know them anymore.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.009
I can loan you a T-shirt if you want.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.385
I'm okay.

08:00.940 --> 08:03.647
Take the bed. l'll sleep in the chair.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.203
You okay?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.675
-ScoH?
- Hmm?

08:30.219 --> 08:32.130
I don't want you to sleep in the chair.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.678
I've woken up plenty of times in this thing.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.175
It's okay.

08:39.603 --> 08:40.979
Please don't sleep in the chair.

08:59.957 --> 09:03.074
We're going to save him. We'll figure it out.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.478
- Dad.
- Hmm?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.640
Were you really gonna
pull the trigger on Stiles?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.149
To be honest, I'm not sure.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.947
I'll check the firing pin.

10:23.874 --> 10:24.829
You removed it?

10:29.880 --> 10:32.087
That's why the women
are the leaders in our family.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.374
Get some sleep, sweetheart.

10:44.103 --> 10:45.718
What are you doing here?

10:48.857 --> 10:50.393
I thought I'd come see you.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.816
You didn't just walk out
of the hospital, did you?

10:53.237 --> 10:54.317
It's okay.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.271
| feel a lot better.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.650
All healed.

11:02.246 --> 11:05.033
Giving you the alarm code was a bad idea.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.050
What are you doing?

11:24.852 --> 11:27.059
And more importantly,
why aren't you healing?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.813
It's from one of their swords. It'll heal.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.399
By playing chess?

11:34.570 --> 11:38.734
Back in his room, Stiles had a board
with my name on one of the pieces.

11:38.949 --> 11:41.816
If this is a game to him,
then I need to figure out the plays.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.486
Not so easy to do
when it's a game without rules.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.117
What does that mean?

11:49.960 --> 11:51.200
You're dealing with the kind of spirit

11:51.420 --> 11:53.957
that's lived too long
to play by human rules.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.501
It's a fox spirit that
chose to become human.

11:57.718 --> 12:01.085
And supposedly, that's something
they can do only after about 100 years.

12:03.182 --> 12:04.797
If a kitsune is an annoying pain in the ass,

12:05.017 --> 12:08.885
then a nogitsune, which is a dark kitsune,

12:09.104 --> 12:11.060
is a freaking disaster.

12:14.026 --> 12:17.018
Besides, chess is Stiles's game.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.813
It's not the game of a Japanese fox.

12:21.325 --> 12:24.237
Do yourself a favor
and put something on that.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.031
Before it gets infected.

12:38.884 --> 12:41.466
I gotta say,
you definitely did well out there.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.543
You'll definitely make the team next spring.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.963
I mean, if you want to.

12:46.892 --> 12:47.847
I want to.

12:48.644 --> 12:49.679
Everything okay?

12:49.895 --> 12:50.850
Yeah.

12:51.855 --> 12:52.970
I mean...

12:54.900 --> 12:57.812
I kind of don't know
if this is the place for me.

12:59.071 --> 13:00.060
For us.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.666
I mean, is this you leaving school again?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.211
Is it about your brother?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.216
Yeah.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.216
It is, actually.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.053
It's always about my brother, isn't it?

13:31.603 --> 13:32.558
You all right?

13:37.234 --> 13:38.599
I think I'm just going to take a shower.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.016
Okay.

13:41.571 --> 13:42.560
So are you.

13:44.866 --> 13:45.821
Okay.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.484
Turn right
onto Gaffner Boulevard

13:49.705 --> 13:51.070
and continue for half a mile.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.160
You at least going to
tell me where we're going?

13:54.376 --> 13:55.832
I need to check on something.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.164
Who is Malia Tate?

13:58.672 --> 13:59.832
It's Malia.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.623
And you don't need to worry about it.

14:03.802 --> 14:06.509
Turn right onto Commerce Way
and continue for a quarter mile.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.680
Well, I'm actually a little worried
we're totally lost.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.301
Why do you think that?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.054
'Cause you just made your fourth right.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.761
And four rights make a circle.

14:15.981 --> 14:17.346
I did not.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.019
Did I?

14:21.445 --> 14:23.151
It's a brand-new car.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.694
The GPS was fine before.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.696
Maybe the GPS
would work better if it was on.

14:26.867 --> 14:27.822
What?

14:35.625 --> 14:36.614
Lydia.

14:36.877 --> 14:37.957
You okay?

14:38.879 --> 14:40.585
I need to stop.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.412
I need to pull over right now.

14:42.632 --> 14:43.587
Lydia.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.082
Lydia.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.838
Lydia, stop!

15:20.462 --> 15:21.827
There you are.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.588
What are you doing over there?

15:26.343 --> 15:28.129
There's still a lot of weapons here.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.552
I thought your new code
was about protecting.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.837
Most of them are non-lethal.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.394
This looks pretty lethal to me.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.561
But maybe you should keep them.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.936
There's still a few of us out there
who aren't quite so non-lethal.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.526
Like the twins.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.690
I thought we were
going to give them a second chance.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.278
They don't deserve it.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.952
Things are different now.
It doesn't have to be like that anymore.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.039
I had a feeling
you'd say something like that.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.624
Isaac, wait!

16:02.504 --> 16:03.710
Isaac!

16:09.010 --> 16:10.966
The couch, put him on the couch.

16:15.267 --> 16:17.724
Guys, this is crazy.
He needs to be in the hospital.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.177
Mom, remember what happened
last time he went to the hospital?

16:21.773 --> 16:23.104
It doesn't look like he's bleeding.

16:24.109 --> 16:27.146
- I think he might even be healing.
- You mean healing like we heal?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.821
That's good, right?

16:31.533 --> 16:32.818
For him, yes.

16:33.535 --> 16:34.570
Us?

16:35.871 --> 16:37.327
I'm not so sure.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.548
You've got some priorities
to attend to, Sheriff.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.842
McCall, trust me when I tell you
you don't have a clue

16:53.013 --> 16:54.378
about my current priorities.

16:54.598 --> 16:57.510
You don't show up to this preliminary
hearing, you'll be out of a job.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.061
Why are you bringing those?

17:05.066 --> 17:06.351
In case I'm turning them in.

17:09.779 --> 17:10.985
Well, if we're not going to kill him,

17:11.156 --> 17:13.021
why aren't we at least
tying him down with really big chains?

17:13.241 --> 17:14.651
I might have something more effective.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.803
Get him off me!

17:38.016 --> 17:39.176
Get him off me!

17:47.734 --> 17:49.770
Kanima venom. Nice touch.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.811
You know how they say
that twins get a feeling

17:53.031 --> 17:54.271
when the other one's in pain?

17:54.950 --> 17:56.736
You didn't lose that talent, too, did you?

17:57.327 --> 17:59.238
Oh, I hope not.

17:59.621 --> 18:00.656
You're going to need it.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.824
Okay, I'll give a little hint.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.586
Ethan's at the school.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.379
Go.

18:17.889 --> 18:20.005
Oh, I hope he gets there in time.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.803
I like the twins.

18:24.896 --> 18:27.478
Short tempers. Homicidal compulsions.

18:28.233 --> 18:31.851
They're a lot more fun than you bakemono
trying to save the world every day.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.857
Doc, you brought something
to paralyze his body.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.813
You got anything for his mouth?

18:37.033 --> 18:38.113
Yes, I do.

18:51.172 --> 18:54.414
As a reminder, Sheriff,
we're just here to talk.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.125
We want to review both the successes

18:58.388 --> 18:59.969
and the failures.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.680
Which pile is which?

19:07.522 --> 19:08.807
Sorry I asked.

19:09.524 --> 19:11.856
How much longer do you think we have?

19:12.902 --> 19:16.486
| wish I knew.
But if we don't figure out something soon,

19:16.698 --> 19:19.565
we're going to need to find
a better place to keep him.

19:19.784 --> 19:23.026
I think we're grossly
underestimating the danger here.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.533
He might be paralyzed,

19:25.749 --> 19:30.368
but it still feels like
he's got us right in the palm of his hand.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.637
I think he went to the school.
I tried to catch up, but he had a head start.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.131
I'm on my way.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.390
Derek, you all right?

19:51.358 --> 19:53.189
I need to show you something.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.660
Do you know who these belonged to?

20:04.454 --> 20:07.412
These claws are all
that was left of my mother

20:08.667 --> 20:12.876
after your psychotic sister burned her
and the rest of my family alive.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.225
Stiles.

20:48.623 --> 20:49.954
Really, Melissa?

20:52.043 --> 20:53.908
I shed one tear? That's all it takes?

20:55.255 --> 20:57.667
Come on now.
You can't crumble that easily.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.210
How are you going to hold up
when Scott knows the truth?

21:01.094 --> 21:02.174
What?

21:02.804 --> 21:05.261
When he finds out why his dad really left?

21:06.266 --> 21:08.257
You know he overheard it, right?

21:10.687 --> 21:12.052
You had no idea.

21:14.065 --> 21:16.477
You called Stilinski right after it happened.

21:16.693 --> 21:19.651
You didn't tell Scott,
but you told the Sheriff.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.816
But Stiles heard it like he hears everything.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.572
But you want to know why
he never told Scott?

21:29.164 --> 21:30.700
Because he knew

21:31.583 --> 21:33.323
that Scott would never forgive you.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.585
He knew how much he would hate you.

21:37.881 --> 21:39.417
This isn't you, Stiles.

21:40.383 --> 21:41.543
It is now.

21:49.309 --> 21:52.676
Is there anything that you would like to say
on your own behalf, Mr. Stilinski?

21:52.896 --> 21:57.390
As far as I know, it's still Sheriff
until you relieve me of this position.

22:00.737 --> 22:04.776
And if you do
decide to relieve me of said position,

22:05.033 --> 22:06.989
then get to deciding.

22:07.202 --> 22:11.821
Because this whole hearing crap
is a waste of time.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.414
I have a few words of my own.

22:15.627 --> 22:16.742
Fantastic.

22:18.087 --> 22:21.079
Let me make this
as short and succinct as possible.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.674
But the scroll said to change his body.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.544
That's it I translated it correctly.

22:28.932 --> 22:30.672
We're looking for a cure in something

22:30.892 --> 22:33.679
that might actually be nothing more than
a proverb or a metaphor.

22:33.895 --> 22:37.604
And what if he doesn't want it?
He's never asked to be a werewolf.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.472
What if it saves his life?

22:39.692 --> 22:42.308
- What if it kills him?
- I've never done this before.

22:43.238 --> 22:46.730
I mean, what if I bite him and accidentally
hit an artery or something?

22:46.950 --> 22:49.191
That venom
is not going to last long.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.784
Something needs to be done
sooner than later.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.616
I can try calling Derek again.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.370
Maybe we should call someone else.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.652
He doesn't look like
he would survive a slap across the face,

23:25.864 --> 23:28.150
much less the bite of a werewolf.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.076
You don't think it would work?

23:34.247 --> 23:36.363
This is more
a war of the mind than the body.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.747
There are better methods
to winning this battle.

23:44.424 --> 23:45.413
What kind of methods?

23:50.638 --> 23:52.424
We're going to get into his head.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.222
So, can I tell Coach
you're trying out for the team?

23:55.435 --> 23:58.347
- I'll think about it.
- Sounds like a yes to me.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.146
What?

24:07.739 --> 24:09.730
Trying out for the team?

24:09.949 --> 24:11.155
Why not?

24:13.870 --> 24:15.906
You have no idea
what's going on right now, do you?

24:16.122 --> 24:17.328
Why should I care?

24:17.540 --> 24:20.748
Scott's never going to trust us anyway.
You see the way he looks at us?

24:21.336 --> 24:22.872
Like dogs that bit the neighbor.

24:23.087 --> 24:26.045
One more little incident and he's either
going to let us go or put us down.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.248
I'm starting to think
the same thing about you.

24:32.388 --> 24:35.004
See? That's what I'm talking about.

24:35.892 --> 24:40.226
I'd probably be in his pack by now
if it wasn't for my psychotic brother.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.434
The one who has to kill everything in sight.

24:44.025 --> 24:45.686
Careful, Ethan.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.232
You're currently the only thing in my sight.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.334
I guess this is the part
where I say something witty.

25:14.389 --> 25:15.754
I'm not witty.

25:19.811 --> 25:21.426
But only if you help.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.187
And only if Scott doesn't know about it.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.941
So, do we have a plan?

25:34.158 --> 25:38.572
Scott is going to try and dig
through pale and sickly Evil Stiles's mind

25:38.788 --> 25:40.995
to unearth pale and sickly Real Stiles.

25:41.207 --> 25:44.415
Then guide him back
from the depths of his own subconscious.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.625
But he's not going to do it alone.

25:47.088 --> 25:48.043
What do you mean?

25:49.257 --> 25:51.168
Somebody needs to go in with you.

25:57.432 --> 25:59.798
Come on, Coach,
you gotta have a lighter.

26:00.018 --> 26:03.351
I'm gonna burn it down for Erica, for Boyd.

26:06.482 --> 26:07.733
For everyone.

26:08.526 --> 26:10.687
I'm gonna burn it. I'm gonna burn it.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.485
Nice sword.

26:26.753 --> 26:27.993
Isaac.

26:40.183 --> 26:41.969
- Was that a good idea?
- Probably not.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.476
They're not going to
kill each other, are they?

26:52.445 --> 26:53.901
I think they're going to try.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.824
So what do we do if we find him?

27:01.746 --> 27:04.237
You're going to have to
guide him out somehow.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.949
Try to give him back control
of his mind, his body.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.205
Could you elaborate
on the "somehow"?

27:11.798 --> 27:13.629
It's not feeling very specific at the moment.

27:14.675 --> 27:15.755
Improvise.

27:17.887 --> 27:20.094
What if this is just another trick?

27:20.306 --> 27:23.139
When are you people going
to start trusting me?

27:25.561 --> 27:26.971
I meant him.

27:27.188 --> 27:28.143
Oh.

27:28.773 --> 27:31.435
Scott, we're running out of time.

28:16.988 --> 28:18.228
Derek.

28:19.657 --> 28:22.069
Okay, listen. Listen to me.

28:22.577 --> 28:24.659
Whatever's gotten into your head,
this isn't the way to deal with it.

28:24.871 --> 28:27.613
You burn my family, I burn yours.

28:29.792 --> 28:30.781
In fact,

28:31.878 --> 28:35.712
I'll burn the whole
building down around you.

28:46.267 --> 28:49.851
That was Kate.
You know I had nothing to do with that.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.143
I'm not your enemy, Derek. Not anymore.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.600
Yeah, you are.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.523
You and Allison.

29:01.324 --> 29:02.734
Which is why,

29:04.410 --> 29:06.947
I'm not gonna light this yet. I'm not.

29:09.832 --> 29:11.868
We're going to wait until she gets home.

29:12.835 --> 29:14.541
And we're going to let her watch.

29:23.804 --> 29:26.136
- You just saved my job.
- Probably.

29:26.349 --> 29:27.589
Why?

29:31.604 --> 29:32.810
Two reasons.

29:33.022 --> 29:35.638
One, I don't think
Sherlock Holmes could figure out

29:35.858 --> 29:37.644
half the bizarre crap
happening in this town.

29:37.860 --> 29:41.023
I mean, this place is literally
the Bermuda Triangle of homicides,

29:41.239 --> 29:43.821
disappearances, and strange occurrences.

29:44.659 --> 29:47.150
I can't argue that. What's number two?

29:49.413 --> 29:52.496
Kicking you out of a job
is not why I came back here.

29:52.875 --> 29:54.285
It was an excuse to stay.

29:56.879 --> 29:58.790
You stalled the impeachment.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.382
That's right.

30:00.883 --> 30:02.384
Because you want to talk to Scott.

30:04.887 --> 30:05.842
That's right.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.847
You did me a huge favor today.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.476
Let me do you a small one.

30:15.898 --> 30:16.853
Tell him.

30:17.858 --> 30:21.817
The next time you see him,
just tell him everything.

30:31.789 --> 30:34.155
Do I actually need to remind you
that you're a werewolf?

30:35.668 --> 30:36.953
We're in Stiles's head.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.455
And you're a supernatural creature
with supernatural strength.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.205
Break free.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.476
What now?

31:04.405 --> 31:05.394
I don't know.

31:06.949 --> 31:09.031
This is my first time
in someone else's head.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.735
Just stay behind me.

31:24.300 --> 31:27.212
Scott? Scott!

32:13.891 --> 32:14.846
Jackson?

32:18.687 --> 32:20.143
Are you in here?

32:41.544 --> 32:43.580
Shh. You have to be quiet.

32:45.089 --> 32:48.832
- I thought! heard something.
- It's okay. You're with me. Everything's fine.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.877
We just have to be quiet. Really quiet.

33:11.574 --> 33:13.815
Look at that.
Do you see that? She's bleeding.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.321
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

33:16.537 --> 33:19.370
What's happening?
What is happening to her?

33:19.957 --> 33:23.449
Lydia, can you hear me?
Lydia, you're stronger than this.

33:23.669 --> 33:24.909
Okay, you need to concentrate.

33:25.087 --> 33:26.202
Lydia.

33:27.590 --> 33:31.208
Lydia!

33:44.064 --> 33:46.806
- Why are we in your closet?
- We're hiding.

33:47.026 --> 33:48.732
From who, your dad?

33:48.944 --> 33:50.445
Don't worry about it.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.322
Doesn't your dad know we're together?

33:52.740 --> 33:56.278
Shh. It's okay. Don't worry.

34:01.081 --> 34:02.161
Hold on.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.209
Allison,

34:05.753 --> 34:07.084
we're not together.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.833
What? What do you mean?

34:12.009 --> 34:13.715
We're not together anymore.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.763
This is wrong.

34:17.890 --> 34:20.347
This is a trick. It's a trick.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.891
Lydia!

34:25.773 --> 34:26.979
No!

35:09.149 --> 35:11.435
Remember.
Try not to kill them.

35:11.652 --> 35:13.062
I was just going to try to stay alive.

35:13.612 --> 35:14.897
That works, too.

35:38.512 --> 35:39.672
Stiles!

35:39.888 --> 35:41.014
Stiles!

35:41.223 --> 35:43.839
Stiles! Stiles, over here!

36:08.334 --> 36:09.323
Allison!

36:22.765 --> 36:25.131
Why shouldn't I kill you?
How many of us have you murdered?

36:25.893 --> 36:29.727
You're not my ally.
You're not my ally. You're a hunter.

36:32.483 --> 36:34.269
You're right. I am a hunter.

36:35.152 --> 36:38.394
Trained before I could even speak,
and trained others.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.366
Do you know
what the first lesson we teach is?

36:41.575 --> 36:44.408
We take our children,
we bind them in a chairjust like this.

36:45.162 --> 36:47.494
Then we wait for them to get out.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.955
Most of them, it takes hours. Others?

36:51.460 --> 36:52.495
Seconds.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.135
I don't want to kill you, Derek.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.638
Don't make me kill you. Please.

37:16.652 --> 37:18.188
Stiles is part of your pack.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.611
What? What do you mean?

37:21.115 --> 37:25.279
He's human.
But he's still part of the pack, right?

37:26.954 --> 37:27.909
Yeah.

37:29.039 --> 37:30.028
Yeah, of course.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.665
So how do wolves signal their location
to the rest of the pack?

37:43.721 --> 37:45.086
They howl.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.896
Did it work? Did it work?

38:35.105 --> 38:36.515
What happened?

38:37.483 --> 38:38.973
Why didn't it work?

38:39.193 --> 38:41.935
Because it's not science, Lydia.
It's supernatural. I did my part.

38:42.154 --> 38:44.110
Now give me the name.

38:44.865 --> 38:45.900
What name?

38:47.618 --> 38:48.698
What are you talking about?

38:48.911 --> 38:52.369
Lydia, a deal is a deal. Even with me.

39:05.552 --> 39:06.541
Malia.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.330
- Hold him.
- I'm trying.

40:32.598 --> 40:33.883
Wait, wait, wait!

40:49.281 --> 40:50.441
Scott?

40:53.243 --> 40:54.232
Scott.

41:02.461 --> 41:03.371
Where are they?

41:04.880 --> 41:05.790
Where are they?

41:05.964 --> 41:07.044
Lydia!

41:08.467 --> 41:09.752
Lydia!

41:10.802 --> 41:12.508
Lydia!
