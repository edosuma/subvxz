00:07.646 --> 00:11.783
<b>you can accidentally do in Vegas</b>

00:11.816 --> 00:14.719
<b>it always confuses me.</b>
<b>Do I tip the valet every time.</b>

00:14.753 --> 00:16.855
<b>Do I tip the mechanic</b>
<b>to tip the man</b>

00:16.888 --> 00:19.190
<b>who comes over each night</b>
<b>to tuck me into bed.</b>

00:19.791 --> 00:22.160
<b> He does a great job</b>

<b>all things that we thought</b>
<b>would be around forever</b>

01:11.943 --> 01:13.612
<b>but didn't quite survive.</b>

01:14.813 --> 01:17.716
<b>And now another longstanding</b>

01:17.749 --> 01:19.985
<b>may be on the way at work.</b>

01:20.018 --> 01:22.854
<b> Maybe going out of style</b>

01:22.887 --> 01:26.191
<b>The current marriage rate is</b>
<b>at its lowest point in a century</b>

01:26.224 --> 01:29.194
<b>and it's dropping.</b>
<b>Of course it's dropping.</b>

01:29.227 --> 01:30.996
<b> We're just finally</b>
<b>being honest with ourselves</b>

01:31.029 --> 01:32.931
<b>that it's not normal.</b>

01:32.964 --> 01:34.666
<b>You made a couple has been</b>
<b>married for 50 years</b>

01:34.699 --> 01:37.636
<b>and no one says Yeah chicks</b>
<b>that's par for the course.</b>

01:37.669 --> 01:42.507
<b>It's always</b>
<b>Oh my god. What's the secret.</b>

01:43.675 --> 01:45.410
<b>You always get</b>
<b>the same response.</b>

01:45.443 --> 01:48.079
<b>She says well it's all</b>
<b>about compromise.</b>

01:48.113 --> 01:51.683
{\an1}<b>And the guy chuckles and says</b>
<b>Yeah yeah she's always right.</b>

01:53.285 --> 01:56.087
<b>He looks down the floor</b>
<b>and a small portion of him dies</b>

01:58.723 --> 02:02.160
<b>and people say</b>
<b>Well marriage is hard work that.</b>

02:04.729 --> 02:06.197
<b> I don't want to come home</b>
<b>from work</b>

02:06.231 --> 02:10.969
<b>and have even more work or even</b>
<b>want to go to work for work.</b>

02:12.570 --> 02:14.572
<b> The problem with marriage</b>
<b>is that we've turned it</b>

02:14.606 --> 02:17.008
<b>into something</b>
<b>that was never intended to be.</b>

02:17.575 --> 02:20.345
<b> Historians divide marriage</b>
<b>in America</b>

02:20.378 --> 02:21.980
<b>into three different areas</b>

02:22.013 --> 02:25.016
{\an1}<b>and the first era was really</b>
<b>about helping people achieve</b>

02:25.050 --> 02:28.920
<b>their basic physiological</b>
<b>survival sorts of needs.</b>

02:28.954 --> 02:31.156
<b> And these days you need</b>
<b>someone to watch your back</b>

02:31.189 --> 02:32.590
<b>since most of you had days</b>
<b>was spent</b>

02:32.624 --> 02:34.726
<b>avoiding shit</b>
<b>that could kill you.</b>

02:34.759 --> 02:38.163
{\an1}<b>The marriage contract was like</b>
<b>hey quick you grab that potato</b>

02:38.196 --> 02:39.898
<b>and all look out</b>
<b>for Velociraptor.</b>

02:40.999 --> 02:45.704
<b> Till Death Do Us Part.</b>
<b>Oh that was that was quick</b>

02:45.737 --> 02:50.008

<b> Goudeau I can have</b>
<b>sex ending to.</b>

02:55.146 --> 02:57.115
<b> It wasn't until recently</b>
<b>that love</b>

02:57.148 --> 03:00.585
<b>was even part of the equation</b>
<b>the modern idea of marriage</b>

03:00.619 --> 03:03.121
<b>as being mainly about love</b>
<b>and companionship</b>

03:03.154 --> 03:05.690
<b>only emerged</b>
<b>in the last couple of centuries.</b>

03:05.724 --> 03:08.693
<b> The institution was</b>
<b>too sacred was too important.</b>

03:08.727 --> 03:11.529
<b>And so spouses were workmates</b>
<b>rather than soul mates.</b>

03:12.364 --> 03:14.666
<b> Where did this idea</b>
<b>come from that spouses</b>

03:14.699 --> 03:16.401
<b>had to be soulmates.</b>

03:16.901 --> 03:20.472
<b>Even if you're in love there's</b>
<b>no such thing as a soulmate.</b>

03:20.505 --> 03:22.707
<b>If they really truly</b>
<b>was only one person</b>

03:22.741 --> 03:24.309
<b>in the entire universe</b>

03:24.342 --> 03:26.578
<b>capable of loving you</b>
<b>you're right.</b>

03:29.014 --> 03:33.785
<b> The definition of marriage</b>
<b>has shames today.</b>

03:33.818 --> 03:36.588
<b> People who get married think</b>
<b>they're entitled to happiness</b>

03:36.621 --> 03:38.490
{\an1}<b>and fulfillment NOI bullshit</b>

03:38.523 --> 03:40.592
<b>and most of them</b>
<b>are in for a real shock</b>

03:40.625 --> 03:43.828
<b>when looking not only for love</b>
<b>and connection</b>

03:43.862 --> 03:45.864
<b>to the marriage</b>
<b>and sexual fulfillment of course</b>

03:45.897 --> 03:49.601
<b>but also for the more tricky</b>
<b>complicated sorts of</b>

03:49.634 --> 03:54.105
<b>need fulfillment needs like self</b>
<b>actualization personal growth</b>

03:54.139 --> 03:55.607
<b>and a sense of vitality.</b>

03:55.640 --> 03:58.710
<b>Because of this additional</b>
<b>complexity more of our marriages</b>

03:58.743 --> 04:01.146
<b>are falling short</b>
<b>leaving us disappointed.</b>

04:01.179 --> 04:05.383
<b> No one being disappointed</b>
<b>vitality in marriage.</b>

04:05.417 --> 04:09.020
<b>No one says I was gonna go</b>
<b>skydiving this weekend</b>

04:09.054 --> 04:12.324

<b>why Khula getting yelled at</b>

<b>Good evening.</b>

04:26.371 --> 04:28.707
<b> These are chuse institution</b>
<b>of marriage</b>

04:28.740 --> 04:31.977
<b>is an outdated relic</b>
<b>of a lesson and time.</b>

04:32.010 --> 04:33.612
{\an1}<b> Marriage is an institution</b>

04:33.645 --> 04:36.548
<b>has curtailed women's freedom</b>
<b>for centuries.</b>

04:36.581 --> 04:39.351
<b>I know feminists have taken</b>
<b>their husband's name</b>

04:39.384 --> 04:43.254
<b>because they say it's easier.</b>
<b>You're basically being branded.</b>

04:43.288 --> 04:46.891
<b>So anyone who sees</b>
<b>you name knows immediately</b>

04:46.925 --> 04:50.662
<b>who you belong to.</b>
<b>Women are property.</b>

04:53.064 --> 04:55.467
<b> Size. I just have to say</b>

<b>Women I. Would.</b>

05:00.272 --> 05:02.807
<b> Never make a woman change her</b>
<b>last name</b>

05:02.841 --> 05:04.542
<b>so people knows</b>
<b>she belongs to me.</b>

05:04.576 --> 05:05.910
<b>All they have to do</b>

05:05.944 --> 05:08.747
<b>is look for the disappointment</b>
<b>deep sadness in her eyes.</b>

05:09.481 --> 05:11.182
<b> She's a Geoffreys.</b>

05:12.550 --> 05:15.420
<b> If you're married</b>
<b>and you're happy that's great.</b>

05:16.054 --> 05:19.257
<b>But marriage is an easy ride</b>
<b>for a lot of people</b>

05:19.291 --> 05:21.893
<b>it doesn't mean</b>
<b>they can't enjoy relationships.</b>

05:21.926 --> 05:24.529
<b>Why does it have to be</b>
<b>for ever contract or nothing.</b>

05:24.562 --> 05:26.798
<b>There's no other option</b>
<b>for the rest of us.</b>

05:26.831 --> 05:30.268
<b>So I'm proposing</b>
<b>a new type of partnership.</b>

05:30.302 --> 05:32.203
<b>It's based on</b>
<b>the traditional wedding vows.</b>

05:32.237 --> 05:34.639
<b>It's called I love you</b>
<b>for better.</b>

05:39.177 --> 05:41.680
<b> It's a way to tell</b>
<b>the person you wish</b>

05:41.713 --> 05:43.882
{\an1}<b>that they are the one for you.</b>

05:43.915 --> 05:46.251
<b>At least for the moment</b>
<b>until you change your mind</b>

05:46.284 --> 05:50.956
<b>or find someone that until</b>
<b>someone stops closing the door</b>

05:50.989 --> 05:53.124
<b>they take a shit</b>
<b>because that's a</b>

05:53.158 --> 05:56.428
<b>at that point you've crossed a</b>
<b>line that cannot be crossed</b>

05:56.962 --> 05:59.698
<b>until your high school</b>
<b>crushes divorce is finalized</b>

05:59.731 --> 06:02.667
{\an1}<b>and you can get in a word chill.</b>

06:02.701 --> 06:04.336
<b>Why did you guys</b>
<b>completely blind.</b>

<b>I mean there are dogs</b>
<b>for that sort of thing</b>

<b>Oh I think you're gonna</b>

06:21.987 --> 06:23.688
<b>We'll be right back.</b>

06:30.106 --> 06:32.609
<b>The Trump administration is</b>
<b>already dealing with the border</b>

06:32.642 --> 06:35.778
<b>the Russian investigation</b>
<b>and potential and wood types</b>

06:35.812 --> 06:37.046
<b>actually on a side note.</b>

06:37.080 --> 06:38.781
<b>You know I've lived</b>
<b>in the U.S. for many years.</b>

06:38.815 --> 06:40.350
<b>I still don't know</b>
<b>what the N word is</b>

06:40.383 --> 06:44.153

06:44.187 --> 06:46.255
<b>It's a bad time</b>

06:47.957 --> 06:51.394
<b>And luckily Trump supporters</b>
<b>have responded on cue.</b>

06:52.795 --> 06:54.797
<b>You'll see why that's funny</b>
<b>in a second.</b>

06:55.498 --> 06:57.567
<b> Donald Trump put his name</b>
<b>on the political map</b>

06:57.600 --> 06:58.968
<b>with a conspiracy theory.</b>

06:59.002 --> 07:01.170
<b>Why doesn't he show</b>
<b>his birth certificate.</b>

07:01.204 --> 07:03.072
<b>And it's not the only time</b>
<b>he's gone do that.</b>

07:03.106 --> 07:05.174
<b> Well it found</b>
<b>the pillow water</b>

07:05.208 --> 07:07.644
<b>which is a pretty unusual place</b>

07:07.677 --> 07:10.413
<b>The beautiful child</b>
<b>went to have the vaccine.</b>

07:10.446 --> 07:11.714
<b>Now he's autistic.</b>

07:11.748 --> 07:13.816
<b> Recently many of Trump</b>

07:15.918 --> 07:18.354
<b> Those Trump supporters</b>
<b>you see waving around the letter</b>

07:18.388 --> 07:22.058
<b>Q are followers of q.</b>

<b>In which many base this</b>

07:25.161 --> 07:26.429
<b>on the Internet.</b>

07:26.462 --> 07:28.164
<b> So I drive deep</b>
<b>into the rabbit hole</b>

07:28.197 --> 07:30.800
<b>to talk to four prominent</b>
<b>Cuban researchers</b>

07:30.833 --> 07:34.737

<b> What is going on.</b>

07:38.074 --> 07:40.343
<b>Q And on is basically</b>
<b>a shadow civil war</b>

07:40.376 --> 07:42.145
<b>between rogue</b>
<b>intelligence agencies</b>

07:42.178 --> 07:45.181
<b>and good guys for lack</b>
<b>of a better term.</b>

07:45.214 --> 07:49.152
<b> We all agree on this.</b>
<b>Q Not 100 percent 100 percent.</b>

07:49.185 --> 07:53.189
{\an1}<b>Oh yeah. Here's a guy who's</b>
<b>on the internet. Not a guy.</b>

07:53.890 --> 07:55.291
{\an1}<b> Not a guy to group the people</b>

07:55.325 --> 07:57.527
<b>to have the full scope</b>
<b>of the picture is less than 10.</b>

07:57.560 --> 08:01.030
<b>We shouldn't be caught up on who</b>
<b>is Q it's more of what is it.</b>

08:01.064 --> 08:04.300
<b> He says that because</b>
<b>what's about to be revealed</b>

08:04.334 --> 08:08.838
<b>is that the Q is actually</b>
<b>JFK Jr. said JFK Jr. is alive</b>

08:09.372 --> 08:12.508
<b>and he brought the plan</b>
<b>to Donald pre 1989.</b>

08:12.542 --> 08:15.445
<b>It's more powerful when Trump.</b>
<b>Trump is a part of the new team.</b>

08:15.478 --> 08:18.181
<b>So he's he's just part</b>
<b>of the he's actually posted</b>

08:18.214 --> 08:20.550
<b>at least once</b>
<b>or twice at least twice</b>

08:20.583 --> 08:22.919
<b>and he said well</b>
<b>we didn't know that</b>

08:22.952 --> 08:26.456
<b>because he it signed us</b>
<b>for 10 20 that's Donald J Trump</b>

08:27.056 --> 08:28.691
<b>but you gotta understand</b>
<b>numerology to know</b>

08:28.725 --> 08:31.628
<b>that there was a tree</b>
<b>where everything in between</b>

08:31.661 --> 08:34.263
<b>is just regular</b>

<b>in the word reviews</b>
<b>all in caps.</b>

08:38.900 --> 08:41.004
<b> Look at the numerology</b>
<b>behind those words.</b>

08:41.037 --> 08:43.940
<b> And it comes out to number 17</b>
<b>and number seven plainly.</b>

08:44.607 --> 08:45.908
<b>Q But just means.</b>

08:45.942 --> 08:48.444
<b> Q It's the 17th letter</b>
<b>of the alphabet</b>

08:49.012 --> 08:52.515

<b> That's the tough thing about</b>

13:22.683 --> 13:27.488
<b>You're doing it wrong.</b>
<b>For our international viewers</b>

13:27.522 --> 13:29.957
<b>how tipping works</b>
<b>in the U.S. bartend</b>

13:29.991 --> 13:32.326
<b>is a dollar</b>
<b>a drink restaurants serve</b>

<b>as 50 15 percent</b>
<b>at the bare minimum strippers</b>

13:35.663 --> 13:38.199

13:41.869 --> 13:45.740
<b> In that case I Tibble extra.</b>
<b>That woman's going to family.</b>

13:47.842 --> 13:49.343
{\an1}<b>And then for everyone else.</b>

13:49.377 --> 13:52.847
<b> Who knows.</b>
<b>There's no logic to it.</b>

13:52.880 --> 13:55.416
<b>You don't tip a bus driver</b>
<b>but you do.</b>

13:55.450 --> 13:58.319
<b>If that bus is Tigi</b>
<b>from the airport to your car.</b>

13:59.020 --> 14:02.090
<b>You TIPA hairstylist</b>

<b>but not your dentist</b>
<b>who does the same thing</b>

14:04.992 --> 14:09.764
<b>but for a different bit</b>
<b>of your head. If not.</b>

14:11.299 --> 14:15.303
<b> Let me say it again.</b>
<b>I do tip generously many people</b>

14:15.336 --> 14:17.739
<b>who said so nicely</b>
<b>after I tip them</b>

14:20.708 --> 14:22.243
<b>but you should know</b>
<b>that when I'm doing it</b>

14:22.276 --> 14:23.478
<b>I think it's bullshit.</b>

14:23.511 --> 14:26.714
<b>I begrudge every second of it</b>
<b>at the end of every meal</b>

14:26.748 --> 14:29.450
<b>I have to conduct an impromptu</b>
<b>food employee evaluation.</b>

14:29.484 --> 14:30.952
<b>Like I like where</b>
<b>you brought me the water</b>

14:30.985 --> 14:32.320
<b>and you had good</b>
<b>communication skills</b>

14:32.353 --> 14:34.789
<b>and then you drew a competent</b>
<b>get wonky smiley face</b>

<b>on the jack.</b>
<b>So.</b>

14:37.592 --> 14:40.862
<b>I'm gonna give you a 20 percent.</b>
<b>Does that sound.</b>

14:42.397 --> 14:44.699
<b>And the service says sounds</b>
<b>like your finest president</b>

14:44.732 --> 14:47.301
<b>has his own TV show</b>
<b>and I have access to Twitter.</b>

14:47.335 --> 14:51.072
<b> And then I say good.</b>
<b> Let's get 50.</b>

14:55.743 --> 14:58.146
<b> The unspoken agreement</b>
<b>is that the timber man</b>

14:58.179 --> 14:59.347
<b>should relight</b>

14:59.380 --> 15:02.984
<b>the level of service</b>
<b>but that's not really true.</b>

15:03.017 --> 15:06.187
<b> Studies have shown</b>
<b>that different races different</b>

15:06.220 --> 15:08.423
<b>ethnic backgrounds cultures</b>
<b>tip differently.</b>

15:09.257 --> 15:13.661
<b>And guess who knows</b>
<b>this servers studies show</b>

15:13.695 --> 15:15.396
{\an1}<b>that men tip more than women.</b>

15:15.430 --> 15:17.965
<b> Boom is tip more than</b>
<b>millennials and Republicans tip</b>

15:17.999 --> 15:19.567
<b>better than Democrats.</b>

15:19.600 --> 15:23.071
<b>Democrats will pay extra for</b>
<b>a cage free grass fed free range</b>

<b>And then look. At.</b>

<b> About the person</b>
<b>who brought it to them.</b>

15:30.812 --> 15:33.514
<b> And that discrimination</b>
<b>goes both ways.</b>

15:33.548 --> 15:36.184
<b>People leave bigger tips</b>
<b>for a more attractive service.</b>

15:36.217 --> 15:39.087
<b>Not me.</b>
<b>As far as I'm concerned.</b>

15:39.120 --> 15:41.255
<b>Beautiful people</b>
<b>already have it too easy.</b>

15:42.056 --> 15:45.159
{\an1}<b>I prefer to give me big tips</b>
<b>to the Bagley's or the Wolf.</b>

15:46.060 --> 15:49.864
<b> Appreciate it more you</b>
<b>see them beady eyes swell up</b>

15:50.665 --> 15:54.469
<b>and then they try to mouth</b>
<b>words of appreciation.</b>

15:54.502 --> 15:59.574
<b>I feel like I'm paying attention</b>
<b>I'm distracted</b>

15:59.607 --> 16:01.776
<b>by the wobbly necks</b>
<b>they discussed the.</b>

16:06.447 --> 16:09.217
<b> Expectation that tipping</b>
<b>and serve is go ahead</b>

16:09.250 --> 16:11.986
<b>and it can cause a lot</b>
<b>of problems for female servers</b>

16:12.019 --> 16:13.254
<b>because their wages</b>

16:13.287 --> 16:15.656
<b>don't actually</b>
<b>come from their employer.</b>

16:15.690 --> 16:18.359
<b> They come from the like</b>
<b>just of the customers.</b>

16:18.393 --> 16:20.795
<b>They have to put up</b>
<b>with whatever the customers</b>

16:20.828 --> 16:23.631
<b>may do to them however they may</b>
<b>touch them or treat them</b>

16:23.664 --> 16:25.433
<b>which is why</b>
<b>the restaurant industry</b>

16:25.466 --> 16:27.535
<b>has the highest rates</b>
<b>of sexual harassment</b>

16:27.568 --> 16:29.570
<b>of any industry</b>
<b>in the United States.</b>

16:29.604 --> 16:32.673
<b> I don't know what disgusts me</b>
<b>more than massage Jany</b>

16:32.707 --> 16:35.309
<b>or the fact that some people</b>
<b>think for those</b>

16:35.343 --> 16:40.281
<b>is the amount it costs to touch</b>
<b>a woman made men look at me.</b>

16:40.314 --> 16:45.353
<b>It's why small triploid</b>
<b>didn't have it.</b>

16:47.989 --> 16:49.824
{\an1}<b> All but it does get worse.</b>

16:49.857 --> 16:52.527
<b>Racist restaurant owners</b>
<b>and race tipping</b>

16:52.560 --> 16:54.429
{\an1}<b>as a way to hire free slaves</b>

16:54.462 --> 16:57.331
<b>without actually having</b>
<b>to pay them any wages.</b>

16:57.965 --> 17:02.437
<b> So tipping was created as</b>
<b>a way to not pay freed slaves.</b>

17:02.470 --> 17:04.472
{\an1}<b>Has to be pretty disappointed.</b>

17:04.505 --> 17:06.941
<b>Well I can imagine</b>
<b>you're a newly freed slave</b>

17:06.973 --> 17:09.444
<b>and the first thing you think</b>
<b>is I'll take that vacation</b>

17:09.477 --> 17:14.582
<b>because let's face it you don't</b>
<b>travel around maybe check out</b>

17:14.615 --> 17:17.117
<b>that underground railroad</b>
<b>you heard so much about.</b>

17:17.652 --> 17:20.421
<b>And then when you finally</b>
<b>settle down and get a job</b>

17:20.454 --> 17:23.925
{\an1}<b>waiting tables your boss says</b>
<b>you have to do whatever I say</b>

17:23.958 --> 17:25.727
{\an1}<b>but I'm not going to pay you.</b>

17:25.760 --> 17:27.829
<b>So it's pretty much</b>
<b>the same as before</b>

17:27.862 --> 17:30.965
<b>except now you have to buy</b>
<b>your own uniform uniforms</b>

17:30.998 --> 17:32.533
{\an1}<b>were covered under slavery.</b>

17:32.567 --> 17:34.602
<b>That was one of the perks.</b>
<b>We never told you</b>

17:34.635 --> 17:40.775
<b>about things haven't gotten</b>
<b>much better since then.</b>

17:40.808 --> 17:42.710
<b> The federal minimum wage</b>
<b>is seven dollars</b>

17:42.744 --> 17:44.345
<b>and 25 cents an hour.</b>

17:44.379 --> 17:48.049
{\an1}<b>But in 43 states employers are</b>
<b>allowed to pay tipped workers</b>

17:48.082 --> 17:51.786
<b>less some as little as two</b>
<b>dollars and 13 cents an hour.</b>

17:51.819 --> 17:54.655
<b> Look on the bright side.</b>
<b>That's enough to make two</b>

17:54.689 --> 17:56.591
<b>guided saving</b>
<b>and pennies at the State Fair</b>

17:56.624 --> 18:01.195
<b>and still have 11 cents left.</b>
<b>Lucky you.</b>

18:01.963 --> 18:05.166
<b>In other countries that</b>
<b>actually pay servers properly</b>

18:05.199 --> 18:07.802
<b>and they bring in their food</b>
<b>because it's their job.</b>

18:08.503 --> 18:11.572
<b>They don't hold your dinner</b>
<b>hostage like a kidnapped heiress</b>

18:11.606 --> 18:13.307
<b>until you pay</b>
<b>the promised amount.</b>

18:14.275 --> 18:17.612
<b>What I'm saying is America</b>
<b>you're doing it wrong.</b>

18:17.645 --> 18:19.781
<b>Get rid of tipping.</b>
<b>Pay your staff.</b>

18:19.814 --> 18:24.652
<b>well. I don't care if the food</b>
<b>is a little bit more expensive.</b>

18:24.685 --> 18:27.522
<b>I don't want to do math</b>
<b>at the end of every meal.</b>

18:29.057 --> 18:30.758
<b> I don't have to. Good.</b>

18:32.260 --> 18:35.830
<b> So spare me the math and I</b>
<b>will eat at your restaurant.</b>

18:35.863 --> 18:38.232
<b>Three hundred</b>
<b>and sixty nine days a year.</b>

18:40.535 --> 18:42.236
<b> We'll be right back.</b>

18:47.824 --> 18:49.092
<b>That's our show, but before we</b>

18:49.125 --> 18:52.061
