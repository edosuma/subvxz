WEBVTT

00:06.753 --> 00:11.702
Here you go. One hot run delivered in Fifth
and Maple in a timely and courteous fashion.

00:11.793 --> 00:14.261
- That's my rock star.
- Are you kidding me?

00:14.593 --> 00:17.346
One package? That's it? All day?

00:17.593 --> 00:19.584
Quality not quantity, Max.

00:19.673 --> 00:23.871
It's what all men tell themselves.
Helps them sleep better at night.

00:24.593 --> 00:27.903
Greetings, y'all y'all.
Big news, my brothers.

00:27.993 --> 00:31.781
You're lookin' at the new reporter
for America's fastest-growing magazine.

00:31.873 --> 00:35.502
- The New World Weekly?
- You're not reporting on Jam Pony time.

00:36.873 --> 00:39.228
No worries. It's strictly freelance.

00:39.313 --> 00:42.385
I dropped my résumé off last month,
and they finally called.

00:42.473 --> 00:45.033
Said they'd give a hungry
young newshound a chance.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.104
What'll you be doin' for 'em?

00:47.193 --> 00:52.711
I'll hunt down mutants and immortalise
their horrible faces for tabloid posterity.

00:53.713 --> 00:55.943
- That's just great.
- Yeah.

00:56.033 --> 00:59.343
Except there are no mutants,
and that rag is full of lies.

00:59.593 --> 01:05.589
Wait till I get my first exclusive. In the
meantime, everybody, drinks on me at Crash.

01:14.833 --> 01:19.031
- This is not good.
- I'm as worried about exposure as you are.

01:19.193 --> 01:21.912
I'd believe that if you covered
your bar code better.

01:21.993 --> 01:25.781
Look, I seriously doubt White and
his merry band of transgenic hunters

01:25.873 --> 01:29.548
get their tips from New World Weekly-
and it's Sketchy we're talkin' about.

01:29.633 --> 01:34.024
What are the chances he finds a Manticore
alum stupid enough to let him snap a shot?

01:34.113 --> 01:36.752
Hey, guys.

01:39.113 --> 01:41.104
You were saying?

01:46.913 --> 01:49.666
- Yeah.
- Logan? It's Wendy White.

01:50.313 --> 01:52.873
I've tried to reach you, but your sister said...

01:52.953 --> 01:56.946
I know. I talked to her. She said
you were tracking down some leads on Ray.

01:57.393 --> 01:59.907
- Yeah. I have nothing solid yet.
- I found him.

02:00.633 --> 02:02.988
- What?
- I found Ray.

02:03.073 --> 02:08.271
- Is he with you?
- No, but I know where my husband took him.

02:08.353 --> 02:12.028
- You've gotta help me get him back.
- I will.

02:12.913 --> 02:17.031
But you have to promise me that you're
not going to do anything until I get there.

02:17.113 --> 02:20.583
I don't have to tell you how dangerous
the people who took your son are.

02:20.673 --> 02:22.823
Hurry, Logan. I think they're onto me.

02:23.393 --> 02:26.271
- Tell me where you are.
- Even the policeman I talked to...

02:26.353 --> 02:28.913
- Wendy, where are you?
- A little town...

02:31.073 --> 02:33.348
- Oh, my God.
- Wendy?

02:37.633 --> 02:39.624
Wendy?

02:47.913 --> 02:49.983
You shouldn't have come here.

02:50.073 --> 02:52.064
I want my son.

02:52.353 --> 02:54.423
He's not your son any more.

02:54.513 --> 02:56.583
He's one of us.

02:56.673 --> 02:59.187
Who are you people?

02:59.273 --> 03:02.709
- What are you doing to him?
- That is not your concern.

03:04.073 --> 03:07.429
We've protected ourselves
for thousands of years.

03:08.193 --> 03:10.832
And you should have left well enough alone.

03:10.913 --> 03:14.110
- Please.
- I loved you, Wendy.

03:14.193 --> 03:18.232
You were chosen for me.
But you should've forgotten about him.

03:19.513 --> 03:21.902
And you should've forgotten about me.

03:25.753 --> 03:30.508
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

03:30.593 --> 03:32.470
Then she escaped.

03:32.553 --> 03:36.865
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

03:36.953 --> 03:39.308
she is haunted by her past.

03:39.393 --> 03:44.672
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

04:22.953 --> 04:26.229
Hey. Only managed to score
about five gallons.

04:26.313 --> 04:30.067
- That should be enough to get us there.
- So you traced the call?

04:30.153 --> 04:34.704
She called from a town called Willoughby,
which is located three hours south of here.

04:34.793 --> 04:37.261
Why is Wendy trying to
track down Ray by herself?

04:37.553 --> 04:40.863
I mean, she knows how psycho
White and his cult pals are.

04:40.953 --> 04:43.865
I can't tell you how many times
I've tried to tell her that.

04:43.953 --> 04:48.708
She's called more than once
with what turned out to be bogus leads.

04:48.793 --> 04:51.432
- Think this might be another dead end?
- Did occur to me,

04:51.513 --> 04:54.983
until I heard someone bust in
and the line went dead.

04:55.593 --> 04:57.788
- Bingo.
- The address.

04:57.873 --> 05:00.546
Yeah, here we go.

05:00.673 --> 05:03.312
- Max is sick again?
- Up all night.

05:03.393 --> 05:06.783
I couldn't get her out of that bathroom.
I think it's cholera.

05:06.993 --> 05:10.781
- Or diphtheria.
- Aw, or maybe bubonic plague.

05:10.873 --> 05:12.909
I hear that's goin' around.

05:12.993 --> 05:16.872
You wanna cover her shift as well,
makes no never mind to me. Happy ridin'.

05:19.153 --> 05:22.589
- Is that goin' to Sector Three? Trade you.
- Whatever.

05:22.673 --> 05:25.631
I got a tip about a mutant
livin' in the sewers over there.

05:25.713 --> 05:28.273
Maybe I'll get lucky and snap a shot.

05:30.473 --> 05:32.464
What do you think?

05:33.793 --> 05:38.992
He'll slog around, come back empty-handed,
tired and smelling like garbage.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.502
Oh, my God.

06:34.793 --> 06:38.468
- Phone number's listed to this hotel.
- Which room did she call from?

06:38.553 --> 06:42.751
- Records didn't break it down that far.
- Well, let's go check it out.

06:42.833 --> 06:45.108
Wendy had the feeling
someone was onto her.

06:45.193 --> 06:47.468
We don't wanna tip the wrong person off.

06:47.553 --> 06:50.306
Well, that kinda makes things tough.

06:51.113 --> 06:53.547
Watch and learn.

06:57.593 --> 06:59.982
- Morning.
- Morning.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.862
Uh, we're here with the Conner party.

07:04.993 --> 07:09.225
- Conner party?
- Hunting weekend. Booked two rooms.

07:09.313 --> 07:11.304
No, sorry, is it under another name?

07:11.393 --> 07:16.308
You know, maybe Bill's girlfriend
used her name to check in. Uh, try...

07:19.273 --> 07:22.902
I can't remember her name.
I only met her once. God, it's embarrassing.

07:22.993 --> 07:26.952
- Maybe if I take a look it'll jog my memory.
- It's OK, we've a couple of vacancies.

07:27.033 --> 07:29.672
Oh, great. Well, then, we'll take a room.

07:29.753 --> 07:32.586
OK, well, then just fill that out.

07:33.433 --> 07:37.142
- I hate it when it's on the tip of your tongue...
- Yeah, I know the feeling.

07:37.233 --> 07:40.862
- Why don't you go ahead and take a look?
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

07:40.953 --> 07:43.262
I don't see anything. Do you?

07:46.073 --> 07:49.383
Well, pretty quiet week.

07:49.473 --> 07:53.591
Yeah, it's mostly a weekend place.
Folks hunting, like yourselves.

07:53.673 --> 07:55.664
So nobody, all week?

08:00.273 --> 08:04.551
That's, uh... that's what it says.

08:05.793 --> 08:09.866
- Here you go.
- Yeah, you're in 203. Back stairs.

08:09.953 --> 08:12.069
Thanks.

08:12.673 --> 08:14.982
Have a nice stay.

08:15.513 --> 08:17.947
I said "watch and learn", not "tip the guy off".

08:18.033 --> 08:20.183
I was just trying to make sure.

08:20.273 --> 08:23.424
Think he's one of White's
fellow travellers? Familiars?

08:23.633 --> 08:26.943
Maybe. Reception in this town is terrible.

08:27.033 --> 08:29.263
But there we go - it's ringing.

08:29.353 --> 08:31.344
- Hear anything?
- Not yet.

08:53.713 --> 08:56.102
New strike plate. Fresh coat of paint.

09:00.673 --> 09:02.152
A new phone jack.

09:02.233 --> 09:05.703
Someone went out of their way
to make it look like nothin' happened.

09:08.153 --> 09:11.828
Ten bucks for a soda?

09:11.913 --> 09:15.189
Honour-bar prices.
They'll gouge you any way they can.

09:15.273 --> 09:17.264
No honour in a broken world.

09:19.713 --> 09:23.228
Oh, look what I found.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.783
- Best place to keep film till you develop it.
- Think it's Wendy's?

09:27.153 --> 09:32.102
- Let's find out. Nice work.
- I watch, I learn, I steal sodas.

09:37.353 --> 09:40.425
Freeze! What the hell are you doin' here?

09:40.593 --> 09:43.187
There it is!

09:44.433 --> 09:47.664
Subject is headed for daylight.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.950
Damn it. All units,
form a perimeter above ground.

09:51.193 --> 09:52.945
Go! Go!

10:24.553 --> 10:26.783
Freeze! There he is!

10:50.353 --> 10:53.390
- Get these people outta here.
- All right, let's move it back.

10:53.593 --> 10:56.983
All right, let's go. Move back.
There's nothin' to see here.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.382
Throw a sheet over its ugly head.

10:59.473 --> 11:01.464
Get it to HQ ASAP.

11:09.793 --> 11:13.422
Just takes a few minutes and the photos,
they come out right there.

11:13.513 --> 11:15.663
Great. Thanks.

11:22.593 --> 11:24.902
Good afternoon.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.223
You folks stayin' at the hotel?

11:28.313 --> 11:31.589
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I heard we had visitors. Welcome.

11:31.873 --> 11:34.341
Just passing through.

11:35.873 --> 11:38.671
Well, you enjoy your stay.

11:44.393 --> 11:46.702
- What's that?
- Dunno.

11:49.553 --> 11:51.623
School uniforms.

11:53.033 --> 11:55.672
Could be a prep school nearby.

11:56.113 --> 11:58.946
Place looks pretty posh.
Must be exclusive.

12:06.353 --> 12:08.105
That's Ray.

12:08.953 --> 12:11.262
White must have stashed him here.

12:11.673 --> 12:13.948
You folks have a kid up at Brookridge?

12:14.033 --> 12:16.024
- No.
- Yeah.

12:16.793 --> 12:19.865
We just happened to drive by,
and we happened to see it,

12:19.953 --> 12:24.504
and we thought that it looked like the kind
of place that we might send our kid someday.

12:24.593 --> 12:26.584
- If we could afford it.
- Right.

12:26.673 --> 12:29.107
Just happened to see it?
Cos it's not near the road,

12:29.193 --> 12:32.663
so you gotta pull right up into the gate.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.267
Right, well, I took a wrong turn.

12:35.633 --> 12:38.466
- I gave him bad directions.
- She had the map.

12:39.433 --> 12:41.628
- Anyway, thanks.
- Yeah. Take care.

12:41.713 --> 12:43.192
Bye.

12:52.393 --> 12:54.349
Forgot one.

12:55.513 --> 12:57.504
Thank you.

13:03.633 --> 13:07.148
Keep walking. Act natural.
We're just passing through.

13:20.753 --> 13:23.825
I get the feeling this isn't
your average boarding school

13:23.913 --> 13:26.029
for rich kids with disciplinary problems.

13:26.113 --> 13:28.343
Think it's the cult's version of Manticore?

13:28.433 --> 13:34.269
If so, Willoughby's cult central, and we don't
know who's involved - sheriff, hotel clerk...

13:35.313 --> 13:38.908
- Let's get Wendy and Ray and get outta here.
- Works for me.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.587
It was probably designed
to be a worker-drone -

13:50.673 --> 13:54.905
good for hauling equipment,
digging foxholes, that kind of thing.

13:54.993 --> 13:59.305
- Does it talk?
- Talk. I can talk.

13:59.393 --> 14:02.544
Good. Then you'll understand
what I'm about to say.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.670
Give it a last meal.
We don't wanna seem inhospitable.

14:05.873 --> 14:10.628
Ship it out in tomorrow's transport. The boys
at forensics can take it apart at their leisure.

14:10.713 --> 14:12.544
Yes, sir.

14:14.993 --> 14:18.668
On another matter, sir,
we may have a situation.

14:18.753 --> 14:23.349
The team came across a kid in the sewers,
before the damn thing broke for the street.

14:23.433 --> 14:26.789
He had a camera. He may have
gotten off a couple of shots.

14:26.873 --> 14:28.864
Terrific.

14:31.833 --> 14:33.744
White.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.903
Yes, sir.

14:35.993 --> 14:40.032
Of course, but can it wait till tomorrow?
I've got a family situation.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.673
Very good, sir. I'll be there.

14:44.593 --> 14:46.709
That was the director.

14:47.673 --> 14:51.791
He wants to meet to talk about
today's little snafu.

14:51.873 --> 14:55.104
I do not want to have to tell him
that on top of everything else,

14:55.193 --> 14:57.627
we have a kid
runnin' around with photographs.

14:57.713 --> 14:59.704
We do have a lead.

14:59.793 --> 15:03.866
One of the men remembers that he was
wearing a backpack with a company logo.

15:03.953 --> 15:06.786
Find him. Find out what he knows.
Get rid of the film.

15:06.873 --> 15:10.513
- Yes, sir.
- And if he knows too much, get rid of him.

15:10.753 --> 15:14.382
Damn it. I was supposed
to have seen my kid today.

15:14.473 --> 15:17.067
Be lucky if I get out of town
before rush hour.

15:19.913 --> 15:23.349
What's up? You look like you ran
all the way from Sector Three.

15:23.433 --> 15:26.709
- And you smell like it, too.
- You will not believe what I just saw.

15:26.793 --> 15:30.024
A mutant. A real, live miscreation of science.

15:30.113 --> 15:32.581
And I got the photographic proof.

15:33.313 --> 15:36.783
Well, why don't you take a load off
and tell us all about it?

15:36.873 --> 15:40.946
OK. So, I'm trawlin' the area,
lookin' for the mutant.

15:41.033 --> 15:44.912
I come across this military action.
They had the fiend trapped in an alley.

15:44.993 --> 15:46.984
You should have seen him, dude.

15:47.073 --> 15:49.871
You're gonna see it as soon as
I get the film developed.

15:49.953 --> 15:53.548
Here. You wouldn't want that
fallin' into the wrong hands.

15:53.633 --> 15:56.545
I'm gonna take this to the paper
right after lunch.

15:59.313 --> 16:02.783
Poor little white boy.
He was excited about that story, too.

16:02.873 --> 16:05.182
Had to be done. Thanks.

16:05.473 --> 16:08.112
I did it for Max.

16:09.793 --> 16:11.351
But you're welcome.

16:11.993 --> 16:16.828
What were you thinking? Chasing
a Manticore escapee into broad daylight?

16:16.913 --> 16:19.381
He posed a danger to the public, sir.

16:19.473 --> 16:22.863
If you couldn't make the capture
under wraps, you should've let it go.

16:22.953 --> 16:25.865
Not flush it into the street,
where everybody could see it.

16:25.953 --> 16:31.107
- Perhaps I shoulda waited until it ate a child.
- You are out of line, Agent White.

16:31.353 --> 16:36.905
With respect, what's out of line is the way
this entire operation is being handled.

16:36.993 --> 16:40.429
- We're understaffed and underfunded.
- Your funding is off the books.

16:40.513 --> 16:43.505
We can't risk diverting any more
without raising eyebrows.

16:43.593 --> 16:46.790
Well, I thought that my job
was to capture transgenics,

16:46.873 --> 16:48.943
not to cover somebody's ass.

16:53.073 --> 16:58.227
If it got out that billions of tax dollars were
diverted to a secret government programme

16:58.313 --> 17:02.022
to build transgenic soldiers -
well, that would be bad enough.

17:02.113 --> 17:06.789
But if it got out that millions more were
being diverted to catch the damned things

17:06.873 --> 17:09.990
because they got away,
it would be a disaster.

17:12.353 --> 17:16.061
Damn it, Ames, it could
bring down the Committee itself.

17:18.073 --> 17:22.988
Bottom line - I don't care
what you do with these transgenics.

17:23.073 --> 17:27.031
Catch 'em, kill 'em, let 'em skulk around
in the sewer to their heart's content.

17:27.113 --> 17:30.230
You just keep them off the nightly news.

17:44.313 --> 17:49.023
Yeah? Hi, Ray. How's my big man?

17:51.953 --> 17:54.342
Well, I can't, you know.

17:54.433 --> 17:58.711
You know that parents aren't allowed
to be there until it's finished.

17:58.793 --> 18:04.231
But, but... don't worry. It's gonna be just fine.
You just do like you practised, right?

18:06.393 --> 18:08.384
And I'll see you soon.

18:09.313 --> 18:11.429
I love you too.

18:11.513 --> 18:13.629
OK. Bye.

18:23.473 --> 18:25.703
- Ready?
- Watch and learn.

18:26.273 --> 18:30.471
- If you're not out in an hour, I'm comin' in.
- Damn right you are.

18:43.353 --> 18:46.982
- Can I help you?
- I must've taken a wrong turn somewhere.

18:47.073 --> 18:49.985
I'm looking for, uh, County Road 4.

18:50.673 --> 18:53.710
Sure thing. Go back the way you came.

18:53.793 --> 18:58.105
Make a left at the drive.
About six or seven miles, you'll hit a light.

18:58.193 --> 19:00.388
- Make another left.
- Left.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.988
- And it's your first right.
- Maybe I should write this down.

19:04.073 --> 19:05.633
Have you got a pen?

19:05.633 --> 19:06.065
Have you got a pen?

19:07.433 --> 19:11.108
- Not on me. Let me get one.
- Uh, that's all right.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.423
I think I can remember. Thanks.

23:23.873 --> 23:25.864
Damn it.

23:39.353 --> 23:41.389
Just passin' through, huh?

23:53.393 --> 23:55.509
Yeah, I'll be there soon.

23:55.593 --> 23:57.948
- How's Ray?
- It's too soon to tell.

23:58.033 --> 24:00.024
But the symptoms have come fast.

24:00.913 --> 24:02.346
I see.

24:02.433 --> 24:05.345
We had an incident
involving one of the transgenics.

24:05.433 --> 24:10.063
- What?
- She tried to stop the ceremony and take Ray.

24:10.153 --> 24:12.872
- 452.
- We have her.

24:12.953 --> 24:15.421
She was cut with the kariff.

24:15.953 --> 24:18.228
It should take effect on her soon.

24:18.313 --> 24:20.304
I'll be there in an hour.

24:45.073 --> 24:47.826
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

24:48.793 --> 24:50.784
Except I want my money back.

24:50.873 --> 24:53.626
I asked for the heart
with the dagger through it.

24:53.713 --> 24:57.069
Why did you come here?
Did she send you, the mother?

24:57.513 --> 25:01.062
If you're trying to protect her,
don't bother. It's too late for that.

25:02.433 --> 25:05.186
What are you doing with Ray?

25:05.273 --> 25:08.071
- What is necessary.
- Could you be more specific?

25:08.153 --> 25:10.713
Cos I left my copy of
Wacky Cult Rituals for Dummies at home.

25:10.713 --> 25:12.112
Cos I left my copy of
Wacky Cult Rituals for Dummies at home.

25:14.233 --> 25:16.542
Ray is proving himself.

25:16.833 --> 25:20.064
Really? I'd like to see you prove yourself.

25:20.153 --> 25:22.144
I have.

25:23.713 --> 25:25.704
We all have.

25:27.113 --> 25:33.507
Yippee. So, after you pass the sacred snake
blood test, whaddaya get? A lollipop?

25:33.833 --> 25:35.824
You shouldn't have interfered.

25:37.673 --> 25:39.709
Sorry I spoiled the party.

25:40.313 --> 25:42.508
You will be sorry.

25:42.593 --> 25:44.584
Soon enough.

25:48.993 --> 25:51.143
We're closed. Come back tomorrow!

25:54.073 --> 25:56.268
Special Agent Otto Gottlieb, NSA.

25:56.433 --> 26:00.870
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- Sorry, didn't realise that, uh...

26:00.953 --> 26:03.103
I mean, you know, I never expected...

26:05.593 --> 26:08.790
Whatever. Reagan Ronald,
proud American, at your service, sir.

26:08.873 --> 26:11.307
- You run this place?
- Yes, as best I can, sir.

26:11.393 --> 26:15.352
We're lookin' for one of your messengers.
Male, long hair, ratty clothes.

26:15.433 --> 26:18.630
Tragically, you've just described
every young man in my employ.

26:18.793 --> 26:22.422
- He had a camera.
- Calvin Simon Theodore, AKA Sketchy.

26:22.513 --> 26:26.552
Six foot, roughly 180 pounds,
smells vaguely of rotten fruit.

26:26.633 --> 26:28.988
- What'd he do?
- That's classified.

26:29.113 --> 26:31.069
- Got it.
- Tell us where we can find him.

26:31.513 --> 26:33.822
Crash, 1313 Euclid. It's a bar.

26:33.913 --> 26:39.067
He and his fellow reprobates go there
after work to drink themselves into stupors.

26:40.553 --> 26:42.783
Glad I could help.

26:46.073 --> 26:48.462
I just don't... I don't get it.

26:49.193 --> 26:53.664
- Well, maybe you left the lens cap on.
- Or loaded the film in backwards.

26:53.753 --> 26:59.191
Or maybe I'm just a loser that can't do
anything right. That's what my editor thinks.

26:59.273 --> 27:01.389
These things happen, Sketch.

27:01.593 --> 27:04.346
- It just wasn't meant to be, that's all.
- I mean, come on.

27:04.433 --> 27:08.870
Do you really think you saw a mutant?
You know how these tabloid things work.

27:08.953 --> 27:11.706
Slap a weather balloon
on the cover and it's the aliens.

27:11.793 --> 27:17.026
A shot of a guy in a Hallowe'en mask
and say that there's monsters on the loose.

27:18.513 --> 27:22.791
Sketch, they make this stuff up.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.469
Yeah, I guess you're right.

27:25.553 --> 27:29.341
It's just I really wanted to believe it,
man. You know?

27:29.433 --> 27:31.947
My life's not that interesting, Alec.

27:32.033 --> 27:34.627
- I'm a bike messenger.
- We're all bike messengers.

27:34.713 --> 27:38.183
Yeah, but with you and Max and OC,
it's not all you are.

27:38.273 --> 27:41.709
If the mutant stories were true,
then life would be more interesting,

27:41.793 --> 27:46.344
and as a reporter bringing that story to
the world, then I would be more interesting.

27:46.433 --> 27:49.231
But I am what I am - a bike messenger.

27:51.153 --> 27:55.431
- It's not true, Sketchy.
- Well, it feels true.

27:58.353 --> 28:01.948
All right, thanks, you guys.
I'll go home now and puke.

28:06.633 --> 28:09.431
Tell me again how that had to be done.

28:10.713 --> 28:13.102
Had to be done.

28:18.553 --> 28:21.306
Calvin Theodore, you're coming with us.

28:26.793 --> 28:32.072
- I've got a permit for the gun. It's in my car.
- Look, I don't care about the permit.

28:32.153 --> 28:35.509
I'm interested in what
you were doin' up at the school.

28:42.513 --> 28:44.504
This is about the boy, isn't it?

28:44.593 --> 28:46.584
The boy in the picture.

28:48.473 --> 28:51.112
What did you think
you were gonna do? Take him?

29:00.033 --> 29:03.105
- You got it all wrong.
- Do I?

29:04.353 --> 29:08.790
Look, I make it my business to take care
of that school and everybody in it.

29:08.873 --> 29:10.753
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
What were you doin' up there?

29:10.753 --> 29:12.584
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
What were you doin' up there?

29:16.233 --> 29:19.350
- What are you lookin' at, you little freak?
- You.

29:21.313 --> 29:24.146
- How do you feel?
- What do you care?

29:24.233 --> 29:26.224
It should have started by now.

29:26.953 --> 29:30.309
- It's started with Ray.
- What's started? Is he OK?

29:30.913 --> 29:33.143
If he's one of us, he'll live.

29:33.713 --> 29:35.783
If he's sick, you should get a doctor.

29:35.873 --> 29:38.945
If he's not meant to survive,
no one can help him.

29:47.473 --> 29:49.748
It's gettin' hot in here.

29:49.833 --> 29:51.983
Can you turn down the heat?

29:52.073 --> 29:54.826
- It's begun.
- What's begun?

29:55.753 --> 29:58.347
That's why I'm here - to watch.

29:58.953 --> 30:01.467
Watch what?

30:01.553 --> 30:03.544
Watch you die.

30:10.193 --> 30:12.309
I said I was sorry about the shoes.

30:14.473 --> 30:17.863
- What were you doing down in that sewer?
- I was on assignment.

30:17.953 --> 30:20.228
I work for a newspaper.

30:21.233 --> 30:23.667
You had a camera. I want that film.

30:23.753 --> 30:27.268
- The pictures didn't come out.
- You expect me to believe that?

30:27.353 --> 30:29.742
What can I say, man? I screwed up.

30:29.833 --> 30:32.267
I'm bummed about it too.
It woulda made great copy.

30:32.353 --> 30:35.026
What would have? What did you see?

30:36.833 --> 30:40.462
Some loser in a Hallowe'en mask.
I don't know.

30:42.473 --> 30:44.543
What paper do you work for?

30:44.633 --> 30:47.193
- New World Weekly.
- It's a tabloid.

30:47.273 --> 30:50.390
Yeah, a picture of a weather balloon
and the aliens are coming.

30:50.473 --> 30:53.067
And if a kid pulls a hold-up
in a Hallowe'en mask...

30:53.153 --> 30:57.112
Mutants are on the loose. I'd have had
a cover if I hadn't messed up the film.

30:57.193 --> 31:01.471
Look, dude, I'll totally score you
a new pair of shoes. All right?

31:01.553 --> 31:03.544
Whaddaya think?

31:04.233 --> 31:06.747
He doesn't know anything. Let him go.

31:09.953 --> 31:14.344
There's something goin' on at that school.
Something dangerous.

31:15.353 --> 31:20.063
- What are you talkin' about?
- Haven't you ever noticed anything strange?

31:20.313 --> 31:21.513
What? Are you involved in
a custody dispute over that kid?

31:21.513 --> 31:23.310
What? Are you involved in
a custody dispute over that kid?

31:23.393 --> 31:29.184
You're a cop. It's your job to notice things.
You haven't noticed anything unusual?

31:33.673 --> 31:35.311
Maybe.

31:35.953 --> 31:37.750
Then hear me out.

31:38.833 --> 31:40.824
There's something in the blood.

31:44.233 --> 31:47.942
I'm so thirsty. I need water.

31:48.033 --> 31:52.151
- It won't do any good.
- I'm gonna die anyway.

31:52.233 --> 31:54.508
Please.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.713
I didn't know you would be here.

32:36.793 --> 32:39.102
I'm honoured.

32:42.553 --> 32:45.021
- How is he?
- He's weak.

32:45.113 --> 32:47.149
I'd be surprised if he survives.

32:47.953 --> 32:49.944
I am sorry, Ames.

32:50.753 --> 32:53.426
But we all have our destiny.

32:55.073 --> 32:57.064
Ray...

32:59.273 --> 33:01.264
He's my only son.

33:04.433 --> 33:07.027
This is how it's always been for us.

33:17.513 --> 33:20.505
You said you had some business with 452.

33:21.313 --> 33:23.429
I'll call you if there's any change.

33:30.073 --> 33:32.223
Please.

33:52.033 --> 33:54.149
Stop!

34:00.073 --> 34:01.825
I said "stop".

34:09.713 --> 34:12.147
You were just pretending to be sick.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.221
- Want me to put you down?
- It depends.

34:17.313 --> 34:20.908
If you hold me up here long enough,
will your head explode?

34:27.112 --> 34:29.752
- You can't win.
- Really?

34:31.033 --> 34:32.864
Not even if I do this?

34:38.913 --> 34:40.904
Made you look.

35:25.593 --> 35:27.823
Sweet dreams, bitch.

35:54.033 --> 35:56.024
Not another step.

35:58.833 --> 36:00.664
Put him down.

36:00.953 --> 36:03.103
You wanna shoot me through your own son?

36:03.353 --> 36:05.264
Put him down.

36:11.273 --> 36:14.310
Drop your gun. Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

36:28.753 --> 36:30.823
Max, hurry!

36:43.793 --> 36:45.943
Get in, Sheriff. Get in!

37:07.473 --> 37:11.785
Well, I expect the long arm of the law is
giving you a sound and deserved thrashing.

37:11.873 --> 37:15.627
- You tipped those goons I was at Crash?
- That I did.

37:15.713 --> 37:21.106
Whatever they suspected you of, I'm certain
you were guilty. Hot run, Ninth and Grand.

37:24.713 --> 37:26.943
- Hey, pal, you OK?
- Yeah.

37:27.033 --> 37:29.183
The weirdest thing happened last night.

37:29.273 --> 37:29.433
Some government suits grabbed me up.

37:29.433 --> 37:32.152
Some government suits grabbed me up.

37:32.233 --> 37:35.145
- Wanted to know what I saw.
- What did you tell 'em?

37:35.233 --> 37:38.669
That I saw some dude in a Hallowe'en mask.
Then they let me go.

37:38.753 --> 37:41.028
- Good man.
- But then I started thinkin'.

37:41.313 --> 37:43.304
- Thinking?
- What do you mean, thinking?

37:43.393 --> 37:47.147
If they were that spun about what
I mighta seen, then maybe I saw somethin'.

37:47.233 --> 37:50.145
- Yeah, a guy in a mask.
- Use your head, dude.

37:50.233 --> 37:53.225
Like they need to cover up
the existence of guys in costumes.

37:53.593 --> 37:57.188
I don't think so. They nabbed me
because they've got something to hide.

37:57.273 --> 38:02.063
The truth is out there, people.
The mutants exist, and I'm gonna prove it.

38:04.873 --> 38:08.627
- Well, that didn't go as well as I'd hoped.
- No, it did not.

38:09.153 --> 38:12.748
Course, the important question is,
who gets to tell Max?

38:12.993 --> 38:16.952
She was exposed. She not only survived,
she didn't even show symptoms.

38:17.033 --> 38:19.501
How is that possible?

38:19.913 --> 38:22.222
Sandeman.

38:22.433 --> 38:26.824
His work at Manticore must have
progressed further than we'd thought.

38:28.113 --> 38:30.786
We need to find out
if the others are immune as well.

38:30.953 --> 38:35.071
I'll deal with the other transgenics,
and I'll deal with 452.

38:35.153 --> 38:38.190
- But I have to find out what happened to Ray.
- Ames...

38:38.273 --> 38:41.822
- It's possible he survived.
- Possible, but doubtful.

38:43.153 --> 38:45.189
I need to know.

38:47.033 --> 38:50.628
- I have to be sure.
- You do whatever you have to do.

38:50.713 --> 38:53.511
You just find out what the hell is going on.

38:53.593 --> 38:57.188
This could jeopardise
everything we've worked towards.

39:01.833 --> 39:06.429
- It's a shame we have to leave this place.
- Can't be helped. We'll find somewhere else.

39:06.513 --> 39:08.390
Samuel.

39:21.193 --> 39:24.788
No worries. This isn't gonna hurt.

39:24.993 --> 39:28.906
But with any luck it'll kill ya.

39:34.233 --> 39:38.829
That was Sam Carr at the hospital.
Ray's blood work came back. He'll be fine.

39:38.913 --> 39:41.381
Doc have any idea what they exposed him to?

39:41.473 --> 39:45.625
Some kind of pathogen or viral agent
he's never seen before.

39:45.713 --> 39:50.070
Those snakes must be carriers,
hosts for whatever bug it is.

39:51.393 --> 39:56.148
Well, whatever it is, kid's immune system
kicked in with the right antibodies.

39:56.353 --> 39:59.743
That nutcase priestess bitch
said that he had to prove himself.

39:59.833 --> 40:02.870
Like this was some kind of test
to see if he'd survive.

40:02.953 --> 40:05.672
If he didn't, he wasn't one of them.

40:05.793 --> 40:08.626
You were exposed. You didn't get sick.

40:08.713 --> 40:11.432
Guess that makes me an honorary member.

40:12.033 --> 40:13.432
Congratulations.

40:13.633 --> 40:16.989
Think if I concentrated
I could make stuff fly around the room?

40:17.073 --> 40:21.669
I wouldn't count on it. My guess would be
that the kid that went all poltergeist on you

40:21.753 --> 40:24.426
was part of some kind of
special breeding line.

40:24.513 --> 40:28.586
Makes you wonder what other tricks
they have up their sleeves.

40:30.393 --> 40:32.384
Poor kid.

40:32.473 --> 40:35.431
Mom's gone. Dad's a freak.

40:35.633 --> 40:39.069
Not exactly the storybook ending
we were hoping for.

40:39.153 --> 40:41.542
At least we got him away
from those people.

40:41.633 --> 40:46.627
That's what Wendy wanted. I talked to her
sister, by the way. She's on her way down.

40:47.193 --> 40:52.221
Made arrangements to get her and Ray
on a plane, as far away from White as I can.

40:56.313 --> 40:59.669
- Hey, Ray. How you feelin'?
- OK.

41:00.993 --> 41:04.110
Did I pass? Am I strong?

41:06.993 --> 41:10.508
- You did fine.
- What do you need to be strong for, Ray?

41:10.993 --> 41:14.622
- For the Coming.
- The Coming? What's that?

41:15.593 --> 41:17.823
Nobody ever told me it.

41:17.913 --> 41:20.711
Except it's bad if you're not one of us.

41:51.153 --> 41:54.111
