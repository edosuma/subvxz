17:54.158 --> 17:56.201

18:10.924 --> 18:14.178

18:15.012 --> 18:17.931
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.519

18:24.897 --> 18:26.023
You murdered him.

Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...

Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr Stark was arriving.

round of my life...

21:14.358 --> 21:16.151

in the Army had never taught me.

the governments of the world

shall no longer be a private organization.

23:30.994 --> 23:32.204
Instead...

23:32.454 --> 23:34.581
they'll operate under the supervision

30:37.921 --> 30:39.214
No, but it's run by people

30:39.297 --> 30:40.673
with agendas, and agendas change.

were capable of in the wrong hands...

30:45.428 --> 30:47.028

our right to choose.

01:18:12.272 --> 01:18:14.316
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.

01:18:20.238 --> 01:18:23.533
As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.

01:18:24.826 --> 01:18:27.621
Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?

01:18:27.829 --> 01:18:29.581
Thrift store? Salvation Army?

01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:31.851
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?

01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:32.959
Yeah, I was...

01:18:33.043 --> 01:18:34.503
Anyway, look, um,

01:18:34.586 --> 01:18:36.306
I definitely did not apply
for your grant...

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:37.923
- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.

01:18:38.006 --> 01:18:40.509
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

01:18:41.843 --> 01:18:43.804
That's you, right?

01:18:44.179 --> 01:18:45.180
Um, no.

01:18:45.347 --> 01:18:46.827
- (STAMMERS) What do you mean?
- Yeah.

01:18:47.808 --> 01:18:49.434
Look at you go.

01:18:49.601 --> 01:18:52.729
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.

01:18:52.896 --> 01:18:55.649
That's not easy. You got mad skills.

01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:57.734
That's all on YouTube, though, right?

01:18:57.818 --> 01:18:59.319
That's where you found that?

01:18:59.486 --> 01:19:00.588
Because you know that's all fake.

01:19:00.612 --> 01:19:01.812
It's all done on the computer.

01:19:01.863 --> 01:19:02.906
Mmm-hmm.

01:19:02.989 --> 01:19:05.075
It's like that video. What is it?

01:19:05.242 --> 01:19:07.122
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?

01:19:07.202 --> 01:19:08.202
Exactly.

01:19:08.537 --> 01:19:09.830
Oh, what have we here?

01:19:11.206 --> 01:19:12.916
- Uh...
- (CLATTERS)

01:19:14.126 --> 01:19:15.335
(EXHALES)

01:19:18.964 --> 01:19:20.799
You're the Spider-ling.

01:19:20.966 --> 01:19:22.843
Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?

01:19:25.679 --> 01:19:27.264
Spider-Man.

01:19:27.639 --> 01:19:29.474
Not in that onesie, you're not.

01:19:30.016 --> 01:19:31.935
It's not a onesie.

01:19:33.353 --> 01:19:34.705
I don't believe this.
I was actually having

01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:36.523
a really good day today, Mr Stark.

01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:39.860
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...

01:19:40.485 --> 01:19:43.113
and Algebra test, nailed it.

01:19:43.905 --> 01:19:45.365
Who else knows? Anybody?

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:48.076
Nobody.

01:19:48.452 --> 01:19:50.454
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:51.913
No. No.

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.666
No! If she knew, she would freak out.

01:19:54.833 --> 01:19:56.543
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:58.835
You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.

01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:02.507
That tensile strength is off the charts.

01:20:02.591 --> 01:20:03.967
Who manufactured that?

01:20:04.259 --> 01:20:05.469
I did.

01:20:06.553 --> 01:20:08.138
Climbing walls, how you doing that?

01:20:08.305 --> 01:20:09.556
Adhesive gloves?

01:20:09.723 --> 01:20:11.016
It's a long story. I was...

01:20:11.641 --> 01:20:13.852
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

01:20:14.019 --> 01:20:15.020
Yes, I can.

01:20:15.187 --> 01:20:16.354
I'm blind!

01:20:17.314 --> 01:20:18.899
I can see in those.

01:20:19.065 --> 01:20:19.900
Okay?

01:20:20.066 --> 01:20:22.402
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...

01:20:22.486 --> 01:20:24.779
it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.

01:20:25.322 --> 01:20:29.618
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.

01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:32.204
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

01:20:32.287 --> 01:20:34.664
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

01:20:34.748 --> 01:20:35.874
That's why I'm here.

01:20:38.793 --> 01:20:39.920
Why you doing this?

01:20:41.338 --> 01:20:42.506
I gotta know, what's your MO?

01:20:42.589 --> 01:20:44.509
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?

01:20:45.133 --> 01:20:46.343
Because...

01:20:47.677 --> 01:20:48.762
(STAMMERS)

01:20:50.388 --> 01:20:52.349
Because I've been me my whole life,

01:20:52.432 --> 01:20:54.100
and I've had these powers
for six months.

01:20:54.559 --> 01:20:55.727
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:55.810 --> 01:20:58.188
I read books, I build computers.

01:20:59.397 --> 01:21:02.067
Yeah, I would love to play football,

01:21:02.150 --> 01:21:03.750
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.

01:21:03.944 --> 01:21:05.445
Sure, because you're different.

01:21:05.612 --> 01:21:08.532
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.

01:21:12.244 --> 01:21:16.540
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

01:21:18.959 --> 01:21:21.086
and then the bad things happen...

01:21:21.836 --> 01:21:23.463
they happen because of you.

01:21:28.134 --> 01:21:30.720
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?

01:21:30.887 --> 01:21:33.098
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?

01:21:33.348 --> 01:21:35.892
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.

01:21:36.893 --> 01:21:38.478
That's what it is.

01:21:45.735 --> 01:21:47.904
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.

01:21:51.741 --> 01:21:52.867
(TONY EXHALES)

01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:58.039
You got a passport?

01:21:58.123 --> 01:21:59.642
No, I don't even have a driver's license.

01:21:59.666 --> 01:22:01.126
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.

01:22:01.209 --> 01:22:02.210
Oh, you'll love it.

01:22:02.419 --> 01:22:04.337
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?

01:22:06.798 --> 01:22:08.008
I got homework.

01:22:08.675 --> 01:22:10.594
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

01:22:10.844 --> 01:22:12.905
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.

01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:14.049
Might be a little dangerous.

01:22:14.097 --> 01:22:16.257
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.

01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:20.645
Don't tell Aunt May.

01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:22.564
All right, Spider-Man.

01:22:26.192 --> 01:22:27.402
Get me out of this.

01:22:27.569 --> 01:22:28.612
Sorry. I'll get the...

(EXPLOSION)

01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:42.792
What is it?

01:22:42.959 --> 01:22:44.377
Stay here, please.

01:22:47.797 --> 01:22:48.798
(GASPS)

01:22:51.009 --> 01:22:52.510
Guess I shoulda knocked.

01:22:52.844 --> 01:22:56.097
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

01:22:56.264 --> 01:22:58.558
Disappointing my kids.

01:23:02.103 --> 01:23:03.855
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.

01:23:04.356 --> 01:23:06.149
Cap needs our help. Come on.

01:23:06.483 --> 01:23:07.484
Clint!

01:23:09.402 --> 01:23:10.695
You should not be here.

01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:14.282
Really?

01:23:14.783 --> 01:23:17.869
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.

01:23:18.119 --> 01:23:20.330
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.

01:23:20.497 --> 01:23:21.497
Okay, they're considered.

01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:22.707
(GROANS)

01:23:22.874 --> 01:23:24.376
Okay, we gotta go.

01:23:28.755 --> 01:23:30.048
It's this way.

01:23:30.507 --> 01:23:32.425
I've caused enough problems.

You gotta help me, Wanda.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.493
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

01:23:40.517 --> 01:23:42.560

you get off your ass.

01:23:51.152 --> 01:23:52.904

01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:11.005
I know I can't.

But she can.

01:24:14.718 --> 01:24:17.804
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.

01:24:18.722 --> 01:24:19.723
I'm leaving.

01:24:19.848 --> 01:24:20.974
I can't let you.

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.355
I'm sorry.

01:24:30.859 --> 01:24:32.694
If you do this...

01:24:33.153 --> 01:24:36.156
they will never stop being afraid of you.

01:24:37.615 --> 01:24:40.952
I can't control their fear, only my own.

01:24:53.173 --> 01:24:54.424

01:24:56.342 --> 01:24:58.803
Come on. We got one more stop.

01:24:59.637 --> 01:25:01.347
ATTACHE: It's just a matter of time.

01:25:01.431 --> 01:25:04.184
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,

01:25:04.267 --> 01:25:05.894
and behavioural pattern scans.

01:25:10.064 --> 01:25:12.609
Move or you will be moved.

01:25:13.902 --> 01:25:16.571
As entertaining as that would be...

01:25:16.738 --> 01:25:18.907
You really think you can find him?

01:25:19.407 --> 01:25:21.075
My resources are considerable.

01:25:21.242 --> 01:25:23.620
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...

01:25:23.703 --> 01:25:26.206
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

01:25:27.415 --> 01:25:29.083
You know where they are.

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:31.336

the concept of a getaway car.

It's low profile.

01:25:38.343 --> 01:25:41.095
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

01:25:42.931 --> 01:25:44.432
Can you move your seat up?

01:25:44.599 --> 01:25:45.725
No.

01:25:45.975 --> 01:25:47.018
I owe you again.

01:25:52.357 --> 01:25:54.108
You know, he kinda tried to kill me.

01:25:55.026 --> 01:25:57.737
Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.

01:26:01.074 --> 01:26:03.284
They're going to come looking for you.

01:26:03.368 --> 01:26:04.368
I know.

01:26:07.163 --> 01:26:08.540
Thank you, Sharon.

01:26:24.097 --> 01:26:25.098

if I had any other choice.

01:27:11.769 --> 01:27:13.354
He's rarin' to go.

01:27:45.094 --> 01:27:47.180
I know you know
a lot of super people, so...

It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.

some psycho-assassins?

Yeah, well, what else is new?

We should get moving.

<i>they haven't let me down.</i>

02:15:41.051 --> 02:15:43.553

let them down either.</i>

but maybe they shouldn't.</i>

02:15:52.771 --> 02:15:54.898
<i>I know I hurt you, Tony.</i>

02:15:55.065 --> 02:15:58.151
<i>I guess I thought by not telling you
about your parents...</i>

02:15:58.235 --> 02:16:00.570
<i>I was sparing you...</i>

02:16:00.737 --> 02:16:03.406

I was really sparing myself.</i>

02:16:03.907 --> 02:16:05.909

I can't trust my own mind.

02:18:53.535 --> 02:18:56.120
So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head...

02:18:56.287 --> 02:18:58.748
I think going back under
is the best thing.

You know, if they find out he's here...

02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:44.544
they'll come for him.
