00:02.255 --> 00:03.879
Hey. How was soccer?

00:03.913 --> 00:07.677
Ohh.
Another thrilling 0-0 tie.

00:07.711 --> 00:12.733
This is why soccer is
America's fastest growing sport.

00:12.760 --> 00:14.070
I don't know why
coach plays me in defense.

00:14.113 --> 00:16.314
I score tons of goals
in practice.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.594
Does he know you want
to play forward?

00:17.650 --> 00:18.738
He should.

00:18.773 --> 00:19.928
How? Did you tell him?

00:19.979 --> 00:21.569
No, but when he put me
at sweeper,

00:21.608 --> 00:23.980
I folded my arms
and made a face like this.

00:25.986 --> 00:28.783
So the coach is supposed
to know how you feel

00:28.842 --> 00:30.203
based on that look?

00:30.237 --> 00:32.610
Yes.

00:32.612 --> 00:33.838
If you want something, honey,

00:33.872 --> 00:35.241
you're gonna have
to speak up, you know?

00:35.290 --> 00:36.674
Sometimes
if a door doesn't open,

00:36.705 --> 00:38.424
you're gonna have
to break it down.

00:38.452 --> 00:41.434
You wanna play forward,
you gotta be forward.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.884
Like it says on your mug?

00:42.918 --> 00:44.458
Exactly.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.036
I don't want to take
someone else's position

00:46.070 --> 00:48.014
and hurt their feelings.
Hurt their feelings?

00:48.043 --> 00:50.101
Baby, this is what sports
are all about...

00:50.134 --> 00:51.975
hurting people's feelings.

00:52.020 --> 00:53.783
If you're not hurting
somebody's feelings,

00:53.785 --> 00:55.732
you're losing.

00:55.766 --> 00:58.255
Now there's your mug.

00:59.766 --> 01:00.940
Are you gonna speak up?

01:04.144 --> 01:06.572
Am I supposed to understand
what you mean by that?

01:06.606 --> 01:08.379
Mm-hmm.

01:10.146 --> 01:14.071
Made by Mikhel for subtitulos.es

Last Man Standing S01E05
"Co-Ed Softball"

01:17.005 --> 01:19.269
ohh. Morning.

01:26.020 --> 01:29.600
What's the matter?

01:29.634 --> 01:30.913
Don't engage her.

01:30.915 --> 01:33.654
She'll stop working
and start complaining.

01:33.656 --> 01:35.488
This is ridiculous!

01:35.522 --> 01:37.013
Too late.

01:37.063 --> 01:38.459
I don't get it.

01:38.478 --> 01:40.311
If colleges really wanted people
to go to their stupid schools,

01:40.342 --> 01:41.759
why do they make
their applications,

01:41.793 --> 01:43.890
like, 20 pages long?

01:43.999 --> 01:45.100
You know, some of the books
you'll read in college

01:45.134 --> 01:48.989
are actually
a little longer than that.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.355
How many of these applications
have you finished?

01:51.403 --> 01:53.688
Um, almost... one.

01:53.738 --> 01:54.689
<i>One?</i>

01:54.753 --> 01:55.856
Almost.

01:55.909 --> 01:58.144
- Ho ho!
- I recognize those forms.

01:58.163 --> 02:00.534
Your ticket out
of this joint.

02:00.584 --> 02:03.456
Yes, it must be miserable
living in this palatial cage

02:03.490 --> 02:06.043
with free food.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.210
So if you had your first choice,
where would you go?

02:08.419 --> 02:11.180
Um, to the recycling bin
with these.

02:11.216 --> 02:13.385
Mandy, college is important.

02:13.429 --> 02:16.857
Without college, there would be
no college football.

02:19.469 --> 02:22.056
Way to sell it.

02:22.103 --> 02:24.191
You know, Albert Einstein
never went to college.

02:24.233 --> 02:25.312
That's a myth.

02:25.346 --> 02:28.556
Well, khloe kardashian
never went to college.

02:28.610 --> 02:31.700
And she knew it was one
of those two.

02:31.747 --> 02:34.144
There's only one application
you need to fill out.

02:34.178 --> 02:35.321
You're going to Michigan.

02:35.355 --> 02:36.877
Ohio State.
Here we go.

02:37.066 --> 02:38.984
Maize and blue.
Scarlet and gray.

02:39.018 --> 02:40.293
You see this?

02:40.324 --> 02:41.328
You were supposed to go
to one of their stupid schools

02:41.362 --> 02:42.788
to satisfy them,
so thanks for nothing.

02:42.821 --> 02:44.326
You know that's actually
why I got pregnant...

02:44.360 --> 02:47.469
just to mess with you. Face!

02:47.496 --> 02:49.680
Ahem.
Dad, no. Please don't.

02:49.714 --> 02:52.082
¶ Hail! To the victors valiant
¶ in old Ohio

02:52.129 --> 02:54.998
¶ hail!

Ohio!

02:59.983 --> 03:00.928
<i>¶ Hail to the...
Dad.</i>

03:00.981 --> 03:02.069
What?
You know how you said

03:02.071 --> 03:03.525
I should speak up
when I want something?

03:03.559 --> 03:04.511
Yes.

03:04.545 --> 03:07.314
<i>I want this to stop.</i>

03:09.655 --> 03:12.721
All right, as you all know,
bow season has begun,

03:12.734 --> 03:14.485
and we are moving
the elkhorn series,

03:14.522 --> 03:16.687
especially the 1712, online.

03:16.721 --> 03:19.206
A lot of hits on this. The reps
are showing you how to use 'em.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.247
I want you to get out there
and push this product.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.495
I want the forests
in Colorado

03:23.528 --> 03:27.337
to look like a scene
out of "Braveheart." Yeah.

03:27.371 --> 03:30.126
What's "Braveheart"?

03:30.170 --> 03:34.876
"Braveheart."
"Braveheart." Mel Gibson.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.926
Right. The guy from, uh,
"what women want."

03:37.962 --> 03:42.930
It's bow season.
Let's butch it up a little bit.

03:42.966 --> 03:45.018
Hey, Mike.
It's not just bow season.

03:45.056 --> 03:46.590
That's right.

03:46.604 --> 03:48.482
It's also the sportsmen's
invitational softball tourney

03:48.528 --> 03:49.593
this Sunday...

03:49.618 --> 03:52.144
- Yeah!
-  All right!

03:52.195 --> 03:54.068
And we're gonna show
those guys at Ted's tackle box

03:54.102 --> 03:57.110
that their bait does,
in fact, stink.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.314
Yeah.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.988
Hey, you still pitching?

04:00.041 --> 04:01.100
You know it.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.874
You still be chomping down
corn dogs

04:02.900 --> 04:04.402
out there in right field?

04:04.436 --> 04:06.744
Yeah. It's a tradition.

04:06.778 --> 04:08.271
It is, isn't it?

04:08.291 --> 04:10.335
Well, softball, bow season.

04:10.383 --> 04:12.919
Ed is probably walking on air,
huh?

04:12.953 --> 04:16.081
I've never been so miserable
in my life.

04:16.115 --> 04:17.130
Gallstone?

04:17.168 --> 04:19.285
I wish.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.560
I'd give my left nut
for a gallstone.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.675
This is worse.

04:23.728 --> 04:25.424
The Parks Department
just called.

04:25.458 --> 04:26.591
If we're going to use
a public space

04:26.625 --> 04:29.511
for the tournament,
the teams have to be co-ed.

04:31.235 --> 04:32.931
Yeah.
Or what?

04:32.965 --> 04:35.017
Well, if we don't have
at least one lady on the field,

04:35.076 --> 04:36.407
they'll pull our permit.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.688
What's the big deal?

04:37.743 --> 04:39.645
My ultimate frisbee team
was co-ed,

04:39.654 --> 04:41.531
and we won the title.

04:43.577 --> 04:46.529
Well, we would have,
if we had kept score.

04:47.822 --> 04:49.492
Somebody get me a bat.

04:49.684 --> 04:51.001
Make it look like
an accident.

04:51.111 --> 04:52.956
I will.

04:52.990 --> 04:56.882
Look, I'm just psyched to play
softball with you guys,

04:56.921 --> 04:59.343
and if we don't go co-ed,
then we don't play,

04:59.382 --> 05:01.218
and if we don't play,

05:01.261 --> 05:04.046
you all have to spend Sunday
with your wives.

05:04.105 --> 05:06.443
Hippie has a point.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.943
All right, guys. Let's go.
Show of hands, show of hands.

05:08.969 --> 05:10.693
No, no, no.
Let's do a secret ballot,

05:10.718 --> 05:13.437
you know, to protect
the innocent and the timid.

05:13.482 --> 05:16.861
You're right. Secret ballot,
the way we voted to switch

05:16.894 --> 05:19.653
from bagels to doughnuts
in the break room.

05:20.816 --> 05:23.621
It was a high point
in democracy that day,

05:23.650 --> 05:24.784
only slightly overshadowed

05:24.823 --> 05:27.567
by that massive heart attack
curly had.

05:29.293 --> 05:31.959
All right, look,
we can count on me, you,

05:31.998 --> 05:33.634
the guys in guns and ammo,
right,

05:33.704 --> 05:35.744
forklift Frankie...

05:35.799 --> 05:38.879
Uh, but, you know,
I'm just a little worried

05:38.917 --> 05:41.977
about those fellas
in gift wrapping.

05:42.003 --> 05:43.339
It's, uh...
They know it's our team.

05:43.373 --> 05:44.837
They're gonna do
the right thing.

05:44.871 --> 05:45.841
Well, I hope so,

05:45.875 --> 05:46.899
because sports are
the last bastion

05:46.927 --> 05:48.933
of male camaraderie,
you know?

05:48.975 --> 05:50.355
I mean, we have to make
a stand.

05:50.389 --> 05:51.488
Women are banging
at the door,

05:51.511 --> 05:53.776
and we have to stop them
from kicking it in.

05:53.825 --> 05:57.015
All right. Uh, all right,
pass these around,

05:57.049 --> 05:58.933
- would you please, guys?
- Gentlemen...

05:58.983 --> 06:01.560
Just mark down,
uh, mark down "co-ed"

06:01.570 --> 06:03.906
if you want to play
with girls,

06:03.945 --> 06:07.692
and, uh, just "ed"
if you prefer men.

06:14.788 --> 06:16.454
That didn't come out right,
did it?

06:30.475 --> 06:32.497

06:32.540 --> 06:34.656

<i>Okay. Buy some tents.</i>

06:57.545 --> 07:00.263
- Hey, Mike.
- They're counting the votes.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.844
Ohh.

07:01.876 --> 07:05.430
All tied up
with one vote left to count.

07:05.461 --> 07:07.537
Mr. b., can I get a drumroll?

07:07.646 --> 07:09.386
What do you think?

07:09.428 --> 07:12.627
And the final vote is...

07:12.661 --> 07:15.684
Co-ed. All right! Yeah!

07:15.726 --> 07:17.388
We did it.

07:18.668 --> 07:19.942
Guys?

07:19.968 --> 07:22.812
Oh, come on. I know
half of you voted with me.

07:22.846 --> 07:25.002
Larry? Come on.

07:25.026 --> 07:27.606
Larry, you...

07:27.713 --> 07:30.642
Well, what's done is done, huh?

07:30.676 --> 07:32.358
The majority voted to go co-ed,

07:32.377 --> 07:34.812
and we have to honor
that decision.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.351
You're gonna hunt 'em down
like dogs, aren't you?

07:38.532 --> 07:40.753
Every last one of them.

07:48.358 --> 07:51.864
I hate writing
these essays.

07:51.875 --> 07:53.668
Oh, I remember it being
kind of fun.

07:53.702 --> 07:57.494
Mom and dad aren't listening.
You can be normal.

07:57.528 --> 08:00.088
Come on. Come on. I'm serious.
What's your topic?

08:00.143 --> 08:03.418
Um, I'm supposed to write
about someone who inspires me,

08:03.482 --> 08:06.719
but I'm worried they're not
gonna know who ke$ha is.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.885
Okay.

08:08.927 --> 08:11.255
Well, why don't you write
about your favorite author?

08:11.257 --> 08:12.708
Write about a writer?

08:12.740 --> 08:16.525
That's like painting
a painting of a painter.

08:16.559 --> 08:18.730
All right. Scoot over.
I'm gonna help you. Scoot over.

08:18.764 --> 08:20.219
Really? You're sure
you're not too tired from work?

08:20.235 --> 08:21.521
No, no, no. Come on.
It's exciting.

08:21.555 --> 08:22.604
There's so much to learn.

08:22.655 --> 08:24.444
<i>Ugh. You were always
so into it.</i>

08:24.483 --> 08:26.494
Yeah, well, I did plan
on becoming a doctor,

08:26.521 --> 08:29.081
and traditionally,
doctors go to college.

08:29.125 --> 08:30.872
Mm.

08:30.906 --> 08:32.857
Come on, Mandy.
You have to have dreams.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.111
I do.

08:35.164 --> 08:37.054
I want to be
a fashion designer.

08:38.203 --> 08:39.582
A shockingly young
fashion designer.

08:39.619 --> 08:40.943
If I go to school
for four years,

08:40.945 --> 08:44.463
I won't be
shockingly young anymore.

08:44.510 --> 08:47.058
Well, you'll still be
shockingly cute.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.206
Yeah?

08:48.240 --> 08:49.208
Yeah, so that's something.

08:49.242 --> 08:50.200
Yeah? Yeah?
You're right.

08:50.234 --> 08:52.041
Hey, stop fighting.

08:53.631 --> 08:54.791
We're not fighting.

08:54.852 --> 08:56.548
Yeah, we're totally
getting along here.

08:56.582 --> 08:59.136
Well, knock it off.

09:00.633 --> 09:02.136
How are you doing
on the applications?

09:02.188 --> 09:03.636
Ugh.

09:03.685 --> 09:06.811
Just do the Michigan one first.
You are gonna love Ann Arbor.

09:06.926 --> 09:08.100
Who's she?

09:08.143 --> 09:09.682
Ugh.

09:13.552 --> 09:17.819
Honey, I think sending Mandy
to Michigan is a reach.

09:17.856 --> 09:18.951
We gotta think
of something else...

09:18.978 --> 09:22.545
a trade school, the T.S.A.,
a short-order cook,

09:22.577 --> 09:25.767
or maybe even Ohio State.

09:27.959 --> 09:30.072
Yeah, I just don't know
if forcing Mandy

09:30.106 --> 09:32.335
to go to college
is the right move.

09:32.369 --> 09:33.476
Yeah, what horrible parents
we are,

09:33.511 --> 09:34.823
dropping 100 grand
so she can read books

09:34.870 --> 09:37.204
and meet boys.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.917
I mean, if she's not
into it, it's...

09:38.951 --> 09:40.631
not into it? A lot of things
that we're not into, we do.

09:40.674 --> 09:44.008
I'm not into kale, but it keeps
showing up on dinner plate.

09:47.751 --> 09:51.828
Wow. You are
in a snarky mood tonight.

09:51.882 --> 09:53.290
Snarky? Is that
what you come up with?
Yeah.

09:53.307 --> 09:54.665
Well, maybe I'm working
through something.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.631
Well, go get a bran muffin.

09:58.508 --> 10:01.172
It's not
that kind of problem.

10:01.231 --> 10:03.622
I want to play softball
with my buddies, right,

10:03.639 --> 10:05.122
but when people tell me

10:05.148 --> 10:07.342
my daughters can't do something
that I know they can,

10:07.391 --> 10:09.924
I feel like, you know,
punching 'em in the face,

10:09.958 --> 10:11.125
but I don't want to be a jerk,
and then, you know,

10:11.153 --> 10:12.425
I don't want
to punch myself in the face.

10:12.459 --> 10:14.751
That's... that's...
that's just weird.

10:16.152 --> 10:18.436
What the hell
are you talking about?

10:18.470 --> 10:20.403
You know
our corporate softball team?

10:20.439 --> 10:22.405
Master batters.

10:26.361 --> 10:29.370
We have voted to go co-ed.

10:29.415 --> 10:30.947
Really?
Yeah.

10:30.981 --> 10:35.376
Wow, and you're feeling guilty
'cause you voted against it.

10:35.490 --> 10:37.496
<i>Actually, I'm nervous
'cause I voted for it.</i>

10:37.520 --> 10:39.119
Yeah, you know...

10:39.153 --> 10:41.205
Wow. Wow.
And I don't think
Ed's gonna like it,

10:41.260 --> 10:42.957
and I'm afraid of what
he's gonna do when he finds out.
Mm.

10:42.991 --> 10:44.125
I think I'm gonna have
that bran muffin.

10:44.159 --> 10:45.878
Uh-huh.

10:51.662 --> 10:53.993
Boyd is sleeping with
that goofy smile on his face

10:54.010 --> 10:56.768
that lets me know
he is your grandson.

10:57.885 --> 11:00.298
I sleep with a smile
on my face, huh?

11:00.332 --> 11:01.765
Oh, you smile.

11:01.796 --> 11:04.337
You frown.
You yell at other drivers.

11:04.354 --> 11:07.013
It's a lot like
when you're awake.

11:08.151 --> 11:10.020
Ugh.

11:10.055 --> 11:12.648
Still feeling guilty
about how you voted?

11:12.682 --> 11:16.534
I thought he'd be
such a good president.

11:19.729 --> 11:23.530
Co-ed softball is gonna change
the whole dynamic at work.

11:23.563 --> 11:25.467
Well, does the woman have
to work at outdoor man?

11:25.488 --> 11:27.995
No, they've opened up
to family or friends.

11:29.404 --> 11:31.164
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

11:31.198 --> 11:32.572
Yeah, why don't I play?

11:32.619 --> 11:34.370
Yeah, right.
Eve, get in here a minute.

11:34.404 --> 11:36.042
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no. Why not?

11:36.073 --> 11:37.293
No. No. No.
She's all-league
in three sports.

11:37.328 --> 11:38.630
Come on. Why not?

11:38.667 --> 11:40.124
Why not what?

11:40.167 --> 11:42.526
No, your father
has this crazy idea

11:42.548 --> 11:43.698
that you would want
to play softball

11:43.738 --> 11:47.231
with a bunch
of gassy, beer-swilling slobs.

11:47.265 --> 11:48.773
Pfft. Heck, yeah, I do.

11:48.785 --> 11:49.767
Eve.

11:49.784 --> 11:51.114
Think it'd be fun.

11:51.154 --> 11:52.766
Good for speaking up.
This is great.

11:52.786 --> 11:53.952
You can't say "no" now.

11:53.987 --> 11:55.829
What kind of lesson would
that be teaching her?

11:55.869 --> 11:57.795
No, it's preposterous.
She is 13 years old.

11:57.821 --> 11:58.799
So what?

11:58.821 --> 12:01.444
Bam! She got you again.

12:06.338 --> 12:08.913
Mm.

12:08.947 --> 12:10.837
What are you reading?

12:10.889 --> 12:16.134
Mandy's college essay...
"My hero, Virginia Woolf."

12:16.171 --> 12:18.841
Hey, that's Kristin's
favorite author, isn't it?

12:19.010 --> 12:21.007
Mm-hmm.

12:21.112 --> 12:22.985
Did Kristin write this?

12:23.015 --> 12:26.151
Nice work, Castle.

12:28.131 --> 12:31.347
Hey, nice essay, Mandy.

12:31.397 --> 12:32.680
Thanks, mom. Thanks.
Yeah.

12:32.738 --> 12:34.349
Virginia Woolf...
impressive.

12:34.408 --> 12:35.740
Yeah, I've always loved
her work.

12:35.767 --> 12:37.434
Oh.
So...

12:37.468 --> 12:39.309
So, uh, do you have
a favorite?

12:39.324 --> 12:40.608
All of them.

12:40.642 --> 12:41.774
Mandy.

12:41.808 --> 12:42.970
Yeah?

12:42.986 --> 12:44.503
Name one.

12:44.708 --> 12:46.741
I couldn't choose.

12:46.843 --> 12:49.941
Spell "Woolf."

12:51.477 --> 12:53.832
I don't want to.

12:53.863 --> 12:56.981
Oh, you know you can't
submit this, right?

12:57.001 --> 12:57.985
Mom.

12:58.006 --> 12:59.293
Mandy, you didn't write it.

12:59.327 --> 13:00.676
When did you figure it out?

13:00.702 --> 13:04.375
The first "I" in "Virginia."

13:04.419 --> 13:05.486
Look, Kristin came home

13:05.517 --> 13:06.500
in the middle of working
a double shift.

13:06.513 --> 13:07.925
She took the time
to help me.

13:07.965 --> 13:09.843
If I didn't turn it in, it would
be totally disrespectful,

13:09.873 --> 13:12.849
and I wasn't raised
to treat people like that!

13:14.269 --> 13:18.011
She gets this from you.
She flees to avoid conflict.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.885
Mike!

13:24.400 --> 13:29.559
And then... there were six.

13:30.843 --> 13:33.562
Hey, ed. Look who I found
in the parking lot.

13:33.617 --> 13:35.234
All-league in three sports.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.397
All right.

13:37.455 --> 13:40.396
Eve of destruction,
how are ya, kiddo?

13:40.456 --> 13:42.906
Awesome, Mr. Alzate.
Thanks for letting me play.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.212
Oh, no. No problem.

13:44.246 --> 13:46.412
There's nothing better
than playing competitive sports

13:46.531 --> 13:48.907
- with...
- Girls.

13:50.791 --> 13:52.130
Come on.
We'll find you a uniform.

13:52.153 --> 13:54.663
Hey, Pete. Find her a uniform
in the back stockroom.

13:54.697 --> 13:56.992
See if we got something small
that will fit her.

13:57.026 --> 13:59.493
Look, nobody's happy
about this,

13:59.527 --> 14:00.719
but if we have to have
a woman doing it,

14:00.749 --> 14:02.700
why not have it be Eve?

14:02.714 --> 14:04.797
She's fast.
She's a great leadoff batter.

14:04.835 --> 14:06.554
I bat leadoff.

14:06.593 --> 14:09.420
Well, you'll still bat leadoff.
She'll just go first.

14:11.874 --> 14:15.845
Hey. This kinda ruins the spirit
of a secret ballot, doesn't it?

14:15.847 --> 14:19.175
The basque are known
for two things, all right?

14:19.209 --> 14:21.426
Delicious smoked meats

14:21.487 --> 14:24.564
and... revenge.

14:24.601 --> 14:29.530
A psychological profile
and a handwriting analysis?

14:29.564 --> 14:32.351
Are you getting close
to finding the traitors?

14:32.385 --> 14:33.827
Uh, a few are
still eluding me.

14:33.860 --> 14:35.689
Hey, you what they say...
if you don't get that perp

14:35.723 --> 14:38.694
in 24 hours, it's hopeless.

14:38.728 --> 14:39.832
Who says that?

14:39.862 --> 14:42.474
You know... people.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.670
I can't stop now, you see,
because that's treason,

14:46.701 --> 14:49.420
and you know what that means
for the guilty.

14:49.452 --> 14:52.341
Paintball-on-the-bare-leg
safety test.

14:52.379 --> 14:54.336
Tried-and-true.
No reason to mix it up.

14:54.370 --> 14:58.344
Hey, guys.
I've got some bad news.

14:58.381 --> 14:59.738
What is it, Kyle?

14:59.762 --> 15:01.428
You know the big plastic moose
out in front of the store?

15:01.456 --> 15:02.847
Yeah.
Well, those jerks

15:02.879 --> 15:07.510
from Ted's tackle box
painted a wiener on it.

15:08.626 --> 15:10.420
This is war.

15:10.442 --> 15:12.721
All right, all right.
What have you got in there?

15:12.755 --> 15:13.963
Oh. Ed asked for it.

15:14.016 --> 15:16.757
Oh, uh, you're
a good kid, Kyle.

15:16.774 --> 15:19.472
Now roll up your pant leg.

15:21.937 --> 15:23.754
Is it gonna hurt?

15:23.788 --> 15:26.104
Uh... have you ever had
a bee sting?

15:26.154 --> 15:27.266
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:27.287 --> 15:29.223
It's... it's like
a thousand of those.

15:39.405 --> 15:40.810
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys. Listen up.

15:40.815 --> 15:44.017
Old buckshot here is cool.
No need to change anything.

15:44.036 --> 15:46.187
We can all be ourselves
around here, all right?

15:46.204 --> 15:47.707
All right. Sweet.
Yeah.

15:47.735 --> 15:50.409
Hey, listen up, guys.
So, uh, a priest, a rabbi,

15:50.460 --> 15:52.752
and a very busty methodist
walk into a bar...

15:54.164 --> 15:56.797
Hey, Pete.
Shut your piehole.

15:56.838 --> 15:59.003
Okay. Okay.

15:59.037 --> 16:00.133
All right, guys.
Let's get ready.

16:00.168 --> 16:04.551
Are we ready to kick
some... opponent?

16:04.587 --> 16:06.511
Can I say something?

16:06.545 --> 16:07.982
Uh, rookies don't talk, kid.

16:08.018 --> 16:11.020
Just ignore him. He's being
crotchety to get some attention.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.228
Go ahead. Speak up.

16:12.268 --> 16:13.387
Nah, it's okay.

16:13.405 --> 16:15.265
Speak up.
Remember what we talked about?

16:15.322 --> 16:16.566
Stand up for yourself.

16:16.605 --> 16:21.119
Okay.  I was
just wondering, can I pitch?

16:25.273 --> 16:28.663
You heard what he said.
Rookies can't talk.

16:28.693 --> 16:30.226
Hold on. Just... just a second.
Just a second.

16:30.248 --> 16:33.334
Listen, uh, can you, uh,
throw strikes?

16:33.367 --> 16:36.241
All day long.

16:36.255 --> 16:37.750
I like what I'm hearing.

16:37.786 --> 16:41.011
She's just a 13-year-old girl.
I mean, how good could she be?

16:44.342 --> 16:46.546
Okay.

16:46.580 --> 16:48.850
All right, kid, let's see
how close you can come

16:48.879 --> 16:51.545
to that lamp on my desk,
all right?

16:57.781 --> 16:59.479
That's pretty close.

17:02.898 --> 17:05.701
Hey. How did it go?

17:05.740 --> 17:09.116
Great. We won.
Baxter pitched a great game.

17:09.125 --> 17:10.579
Ah, that's my man.

17:10.614 --> 17:12.099
Not that Baxter.
The other one.

17:13.458 --> 17:17.386
Mom, we had so much fun,
and then afterwards,

17:17.411 --> 17:19.656
we went out for ice cream
and bourbon.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.414
I had the ice cream.

17:23.448 --> 17:24.428
Yeah.

17:24.462 --> 17:25.481
None of this
would have happened

17:25.680 --> 17:27.230
if dad hadn't told me
to speak up for myself.

17:27.258 --> 17:29.457
Yeah.

17:29.475 --> 17:30.732
Oh.

17:30.766 --> 17:31.962
Thanks, daddy.

17:31.980 --> 17:33.460
You're welcome.

17:33.481 --> 17:35.792
You didn't mind
not pitching, did you?

17:35.815 --> 17:36.930
Of course not.

17:36.964 --> 17:39.573
I mean, you did awesome
in right field.

17:39.608 --> 17:42.111
Run along now.

17:45.353 --> 17:46.909
She's adorable.

17:46.942 --> 17:49.078
Maybe we should send her off
to boarding school.

17:49.107 --> 17:53.035
You know what's
great about having kids?

17:53.100 --> 17:54.171
Do tell.

17:54.204 --> 17:57.125
We get to take credit
for everything they do.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.460
Well, thank God
she's not robbing banks.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.708
- Come on.
- There must have been a moment

18:01.767 --> 18:05.506
when you were watching Eve pitch
that you felt pretty proud.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.160
Every single moment.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.434
Yeah.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.515
Ah, Mandy.
Mm?

18:12.556 --> 18:13.524
Did you redo your essay?

18:13.556 --> 18:14.693
Sent my applications in.

18:14.715 --> 18:16.349
Ah.

18:16.393 --> 18:19.280
That's not what I asked.
Is it your work or Kristin's?

18:19.315 --> 18:21.776
Uh, well, I couldn't have
done it without her.

18:21.820 --> 18:24.150
You are being obnoxiously vague.
What does that mean?

18:24.184 --> 18:25.280
It means what it means.

18:25.316 --> 18:26.620
I am gonna go watch some tv
in my room.

18:26.622 --> 18:28.211
You don't have a tv
in your room.

18:28.245 --> 18:29.421
Oh, yeah.
I know.

18:29.460 --> 18:30.669
I just wanted to make you
say that out loud

18:30.703 --> 18:33.379
<i>so you could hear
how cruel it sounds.</i>

18:36.169 --> 18:38.128
Oh, boy. What do we have?

18:38.167 --> 18:42.892
"Who is Virginia Woolf?"
Or "why I like shoes"?

18:42.927 --> 18:46.219
Neither.
Mandy rewrote her essay.

18:46.247 --> 18:48.937
"Even when
her own life didn't take

18:49.049 --> 18:50.688
"the path
she thought it would,

18:50.722 --> 18:53.236
"she always helped others
stay on theirs.

18:53.263 --> 18:57.016
She is the kindest person
I know."

18:58.441 --> 19:01.607
"She's my big sister."

19:03.727 --> 19:08.524
Oh.
You don't need to cry.

19:08.558 --> 19:11.359
Oh, come on.
You're a little misty, too.

19:11.393 --> 19:13.359
Nah, I was...
I was just remembering

19:13.393 --> 19:16.753
how sad I was that Pluto
is no longer a planet.

19:23.244 --> 19:25.708
Ed, can I talk to you
about somethin'?

19:25.742 --> 19:30.016
There's just one left.
One left, Mikey. Just one left.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.584
Yeah, that's what I want
to talk to you about.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.059
Mm.
I know it was you, Mike...

19:36.460 --> 19:38.479
But I forgive you.

19:41.220 --> 19:42.946
And you want to know why
I forgive you?

19:42.974 --> 19:45.705
Because we've had a great
friendship for three decades.

19:45.732 --> 19:47.327
No.

19:48.641 --> 19:50.284
Well, you understand
my predicament

19:50.316 --> 19:51.912
of raising daughters.

19:51.946 --> 19:54.246
Didn't even occur to me.

19:55.619 --> 19:57.742
Well, then why is it, ed?

19:57.776 --> 19:58.974
Because when
that little hothead of yours

19:59.004 --> 20:02.739
beaned that Jack-wang
from Ted's tackle box,

20:02.773 --> 20:06.965
it was the greatest
sports moment of my life, man!

20:07.000 --> 20:08.253
It was great, wasn't it?

20:08.287 --> 20:09.556
The guy's standing there,

20:09.592 --> 20:11.012
and his tooth fell out right
when he was looking at me.

20:11.062 --> 20:12.311
Yeah.
He goes, "ohh!

20:12.353 --> 20:15.225
It's just a game,
little girl!"

20:15.264 --> 20:17.053
I'm telling you!

20:17.087 --> 20:19.652
Oh, man. I can hardly wait
for spring training.

20:19.683 --> 20:20.730
Now you keep her
on a good regimen

20:20.764 --> 20:22.317
over the winter, all right?

20:22.346 --> 20:23.477
She'll probably grow
a couple inches,

20:23.532 --> 20:24.823
and she'll get a little zip
to that swing.

20:24.863 --> 20:27.912
Those S.O.B.s will never know
what hit 'em.

20:27.946 --> 20:30.275
Just roll up
your pant leg.

20:41.514 --> 20:42.841
What's up?

20:46.564 --> 20:48.479
I think I want to go
to college.

20:48.513 --> 20:49.722
I know, I know, I know.

20:49.724 --> 20:51.181
There's Boyd,
and it's really expensive,

20:51.193 --> 20:52.616
and I don't even know
if I deserve a second chance.
Kristin.

20:52.654 --> 20:54.309
It's just... it's just that
helping Mandy...
Kristin.

20:54.343 --> 20:56.120
Reminded me that
I still have dreams.

20:56.151 --> 20:57.159
Kris.
What?

20:57.193 --> 20:59.153
Great minds think alike.

20:59.187 --> 21:01.403
Look what I've been
looking at.

21:02.456 --> 21:03.549
Universities.

21:03.627 --> 21:05.375
I was just looking
at four colleges

21:05.404 --> 21:06.854
within an hour
of our doorstep,

21:06.911 --> 21:09.264
all of which are rated
higher than Ohio State.

21:09.298 --> 21:11.461
I heard that!

21:13.363 --> 21:15.926
You'd better get started
on your applications.

21:18.270 --> 21:20.171
Okay.

21:20.205 --> 21:22.561
Okay, well, here's
the essay question.

21:22.606 --> 21:24.120
If you could have dinner
with any historical figure,

21:24.218 --> 21:25.153
who would it be?

21:25.194 --> 21:26.664
Gandhi.

21:26.764 --> 21:27.661
Why?

21:27.692 --> 21:29.103
More food for me.
