04:21.293 --> 04:23.428
- Have a good day now.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.835
- Oh my god I'm so sorry.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.504
- No it's okay.

05:05.506 --> 05:09.074
I needed to cool off, I
guess I didn't know it.

05:09.076 --> 05:12.811
- Will say you're
sorry to the nice lady.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.982
Will, you sprayed her with
the hose say you're sorry.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.050
- I'm sorry.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.485
- It's okay, really.

05:21.854 --> 05:23.155
- I'm Jessica.

05:24.357 --> 05:25.524
- Hi, I'm Mary.

05:27.026 --> 05:28.960
- When did you move in?

05:28.962 --> 05:31.496
- We bought the
house a month ago

05:31.498 --> 05:33.999
but we haven't fully moved in.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.835
I've been here
for a couple days.

05:36.837 --> 05:41.673
Just barely in furniture
just the boxes I brought

05:41.675 --> 05:43.241
on my drive here.

05:44.310 --> 05:48.146
My husband is in
Seattle with the kids

05:48.148 --> 05:49.614
for another week.

05:49.616 --> 05:52.284
They're just
finishing up school.

05:52.286 --> 05:55.153
- Oh they must finish
late out there.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.522
- Yeah it's a charter school.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.827
- How old are your kids?

06:01.829 --> 06:03.095
- 13 and five.

06:04.630 --> 06:08.100
My, my oldest is from
my first marriage,

06:09.402 --> 06:10.802
I was so young.

06:11.871 --> 06:12.871
- Oh.

06:14.674 --> 06:18.643
- I'm from here
originally, I grew up here.

06:19.413 --> 06:20.912
Lot of memories.

06:23.049 --> 06:27.386
- I don't mean to pry
but why the move back?

06:27.388 --> 06:30.355
- My husband works
for a tech company

06:30.357 --> 06:33.625
and they opened up
an office downtown.

06:35.828 --> 06:39.064
- Do you still have family here?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.066
- No.

06:41.401 --> 06:45.837
I thought my kids might like
growing up in the suburbs,

06:45.839 --> 06:48.106
you know, small town life.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.275
- I sure do.

06:52.712 --> 06:56.314
Do you work Mary or
just inside the home.

06:58.384 --> 07:01.219
- I am a freelance writer.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.455
Mostly editorial blog stuff.

07:05.024 --> 07:07.459
- Oh like the Huffington post.

07:08.694 --> 07:09.861
- Yeah kinda.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.367
- Will.

07:15.369 --> 07:17.769
- Okay I should get going.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.772
I've got furniture
being delivered today,

07:20.774 --> 07:23.041
I should get changed.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.210
- Sorry again about that.

07:26.412 --> 07:28.246
I hope you and your husband

07:28.248 --> 07:31.483
can come over for
dinner sometime.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.485
- Yeah.

07:33.219 --> 07:35.053
Yeah that sounds nice.

07:35.955 --> 07:36.955
Okay.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.692
- Welcome to the
neighborhood Mary.

08:26.372 --> 08:29.107
- Hi, how's everything?
- Hey.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.342
- Good.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.610
- You guys on your
way to school?

08:31.612 --> 08:33.778
- Yup, today already.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.847
- How are you?
- I'm good.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.450
- I miss you guys though.

08:38.452 --> 08:40.519
- Awh,
we miss you too.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.655
- Did I tell you that
I got some chairs?

08:43.657 --> 08:46.558
- No,
what kind of chairs?

08:46.560 --> 08:49.628
- The biggest ones I
could fit in my car.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.732
- Great.

08:53.734 --> 08:57.369
- I met one of our
neighbors this morning.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.503
- Oh really?

08:58.505 --> 09:00.205
What are they like?

09:00.207 --> 09:03.975
- I can tell she's gonna
be real fuckin' nosy.

09:06.580 --> 09:09.147
- Making
friends already.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.016
What's her name?

09:11.018 --> 09:12.018
- Jessica.

09:13.252 --> 09:14.853
- Very nice.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.322
- Her son sprayed
me with a hose.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.558
- On purpose?

09:19.560 --> 09:21.192
- No not on purpose
he's like four.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.428
- Oh well yeah.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.564
- Did you know that we
had an ice cream truck?

09:25.566 --> 09:30.435
- Oh great, that's
what they need, more sugar.

09:30.437 --> 09:34.573
Well, it'll help with
the transition I guess.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.575
- No it was super weird.

09:36.577 --> 09:40.545
Felt like I was in a
time warp or something.

09:40.547 --> 09:43.848
Dunno, something about
him was so creepy.

09:45.585 --> 09:49.421
- Ew, how
was the ice cream?

09:49.423 --> 09:51.790
- No I didn't get anything.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.025
- Well look
we've gotta try it

09:54.027 --> 09:56.127
when we get there.

09:56.129 --> 10:00.699
- Eugh, I can't wait for
you guys to get here.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.367
- Us too.

10:02.369 --> 10:05.637
- I don't think I've
been alone since,

10:06.472 --> 10:09.374
god since Jakey was born.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.643
What did I do before kids?

10:12.411 --> 10:14.879
- I know right?

10:14.881 --> 10:17.115
- I should go out and
have some wild nights.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.485
You know, reclaim my
youth or whatever.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.587
- Yeah why
don't you go party

10:22.589 --> 10:24.456
with some soccer moms?

10:25.891 --> 10:26.791
- How are my babies?

10:26.793 --> 10:29.561
Can you put them on speaker?

10:29.563 --> 10:30.962
- Sure,
hey do you guys

10:30.964 --> 10:33.598
wanna say hi to your mom?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
- Hi guys.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.402
I can't wait to see you.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.405
Jacob are you so excited to
be almost done with school?

10:40.407 --> 10:41.840
- Yeah.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.776
- I can't wait to see you.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.177
- Okay.

10:47.780 --> 10:52.083
- Come on Jakey it'll be,
you'll love it out here.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.652
- Whatever.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.122
- Shelby, how are you?

10:57.124 --> 10:58.757
- Hi mommy.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.860
- How's my sweet girl?

11:01.862 --> 11:04.763
- Good, I miss you.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.865
- I miss you too baby.

11:08.367 --> 11:09.634
- Hey Shelby.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.636
- Hey I'm
almost at Jacob's school

11:11.638 --> 11:15.974
so I gotta let you go
but, how's the writing?

11:15.976 --> 11:17.442
How's it coming?

11:21.814 --> 11:23.348
Hello?

11:25.619 --> 11:27.118
- It's okay.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.821
I keep having these
great starts and then

11:29.823 --> 11:31.456
they fizzle out.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.526
I think I'm just
trying to force it.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.029
- Hey it'll come.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.698
- I know, thank you.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.400
- Okay I'm here.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.568
Okay, we'll call you later okay?

11:43.570 --> 11:44.836

12:19.205 --> 12:20.872

12:20.874 --> 12:21.973
- It's just me.

12:24.677 --> 12:25.677
- Um okay.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.949
Do you need me to sign anything?

12:39.960 --> 12:40.960
Cool.

12:49.735 --> 12:52.804
Do you work or just
inside the home?

13:01.581 --> 13:02.581
Excuse me.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.619
- Sorry I thought you
knew I was comin' in.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.053
- I did, I just...

13:13.425 --> 13:15.293
See some people knock.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.803
Right there is fine.

13:35.447 --> 13:36.848
- Hello new neighbor.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.783
Eugh I know, back

13:43.756 --> 13:45.323
- Well I know you're waiting
for your family to arrive

13:45.325 --> 13:49.027
so I wanted to invite
you over to a party

13:49.029 --> 13:50.995
that Christina here
is having tonight.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.831
- Yeah my son Max's graduation.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.767
We're barbecuing so
there'll be lots of alcohol

13:55.769 --> 13:57.168
and obnoxious teenagers.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.938
- Hi I'm Katie.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.773
It's nice to have some
new blood on the block.

14:01.775 --> 14:03.308
These bitches are a handful.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.310
- Katie!

14:06.879 --> 14:08.012
- Hi I'm Mary.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.181
- Oh I already told
them all about you.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.152
You shouldn't be cooped
up here all by yourself,

14:14.154 --> 14:16.688
come to the party, it'll be fun.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.122
I mean when was the last time

14:18.124 --> 14:21.326
you didn't have
your kids around?

14:21.328 --> 14:22.794
- 12 years.

14:22.796 --> 14:24.462
- Oh honey.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.999
You've been a mom since you
were a baby, you poor thing.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.001
- Yeah I had my
son really young,

14:30.003 --> 14:32.370
but I wouldn't change it
for anything you know?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.005
- Of course you wouldn't.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.373
Don't pay any
attention to Katie,

14:35.375 --> 14:36.841
she has foot and mouth disease.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.076
- Oh please.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.911
- Come on we wanna
show our new neighbor

14:39.913 --> 14:41.713
a little hospitality.

14:43.015 --> 14:44.148
- I don't know.

14:50.589 --> 14:52.090
- You don't even have furniture.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.391
Why don't you let
us cook for you?

14:53.393 --> 14:56.794
I bet you don't have
any food in the house.

14:58.497 --> 14:59.264
- Okay.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.266
- Okay!

15:07.874 --> 15:12.377
- I'll fill you in on all
the neighborhood gossip.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.846
- You'll have fun I promise.

15:40.739 --> 15:41.806
- 'Scuse me.

15:43.409 --> 15:44.709
- Yeah?

15:44.711 --> 15:46.477
- I'm all done.

15:46.479 --> 15:50.782
You wanna check that everything
is where you want it?

15:51.550 --> 15:52.550
- Sure.

15:56.555 --> 15:58.156
- That okay?

15:58.158 --> 16:01.993
I didn't know where
your TV was going.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.061
- It's fine.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.631
We can always move it.

16:10.936 --> 16:11.936
Okay?

16:13.906 --> 16:15.073
- Your bed's in your room

16:15.075 --> 16:17.041
if you wanna look at that.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.478
- No.

16:23.782 --> 16:24.749
- Are you sure?

16:24.751 --> 16:26.818
- I think we're all set.

16:38.130 --> 16:40.765
I'm gonna be late for something.

16:44.269 --> 16:46.404
Okay thanks of your help.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.908
- Are you staying
here all alone?

16:53.012 --> 16:54.278
- What?

16:55.447 --> 16:58.082
- Pretty lady all
by her lonesome.

16:59.985 --> 17:01.052
- No.

17:01.820 --> 17:04.288
My husband is on his way.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.125
- Just showing some concern.

17:07.127 --> 17:10.294
- Not that it's any
of your business.

17:12.064 --> 17:14.065
Thanks you should go.

18:07.352 --> 18:09.587
- Let's get outta here.

19:04.343 --> 19:06.410
You like to get high Mary?

19:06.412 --> 19:08.012

19:18.825 --> 19:22.126
I mean just don't tell your mom.

19:22.128 --> 19:26.130
- My mom's drug of choice is
Vicodin so, you're okay there.

19:26.132 --> 19:29.834
- Well, I don't
really touch pills.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.671
- I can't believe she's
really doing this.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.673
- I know.

19:39.445 --> 19:40.445
- Here.

19:44.383 --> 19:46.150
- Who's house is this?

19:46.152 --> 19:47.985
- It's the Worcer's house.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.755
Don't worry they're
at the party.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.063
- So where do you
guys go to school?

19:59.065 --> 20:00.231
- St. Ignatius.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.668
- Central.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.971
- Oh my god I went to
central, that's awesome.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.306
How is it?

20:08.308 --> 20:09.373
- It's okay.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.528
- Can I have a sip
of your beer please?

20:30.530 --> 20:31.530
Thank you.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.007
No thank you, I think I've
had enough for one night.

20:43.009 --> 20:43.941
I don't know how I'm gonna be

20:43.943 --> 20:46.377
in the social setting right now.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.946
- I wouldn't worry too bad,
they've been drinking all night,

20:48.948 --> 20:52.049
I don't think
they're gonna notice.

20:52.051 --> 20:55.786
- You so do not seem
like a grown up.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.188
- Tracy that is the nicest thing

20:57.190 --> 20:58.789
anybody has ever said to me.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.928
Hey do you have Mr
Stevens for English?

21:03.930 --> 21:04.996
- Yeah I do.

21:06.098 --> 21:09.900
- Will you tell him
that Mary marsh says hi?

21:09.902 --> 21:10.968
He was my favorite.

21:10.970 --> 21:11.970
- Okay.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.207
- Alright I'm gonna go be
neighborly now, wish me luck!

21:16.209 --> 21:18.442
Hey not a word of

21:21.046 --> 21:21.812
- Okay.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.614
- See you later, mom.

21:29.421 --> 21:30.421
She's cool.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.024
- A little bit.

22:13.465 --> 22:14.832
- Mary!

22:14.834 --> 22:18.769
- Oh Mary darling, we're so
happy you could come, welcome.

22:20.505 --> 22:21.806
- My pleasure.

22:21.808 --> 22:24.675
- Did you happen to see
my son Max round here?

22:24.677 --> 22:27.511
About 18, thinks he's the shit.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.848
- Uh, no no I haven't seen him.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.552
- Oh well my husband just
went looking for him.

22:34.554 --> 22:37.355
We wanna cut the cake.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.523
- You clean up nice.

22:39.525 --> 22:40.725
- Oh, thanks.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.796
- No Mary what can
I get you to drink?

22:48.333 --> 22:49.667

22:49.669 --> 22:53.604
- No no no, what's your drink

22:56.508 --> 22:58.409

22:59.712 --> 23:03.414
Come come, I wanna introduce
you to some people.

23:13.692 --> 23:14.692

23:20.532 --> 23:22.666
Come on we're gonna do the cake.

23:22.668 --> 23:24.835
- Dude, you should go.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.237
- Max!

23:31.042 --> 23:32.343
- Aren't you gonna come with me?

23:32.345 --> 23:35.012
- Hell no, I'm too
high for that shit.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.214
I'm just gonna finish my beer.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.984
- Well suit
yourself, I gotta go.

23:44.356 --> 23:47.758
- Max, come on we're
gonna do the cake.

23:49.694 --> 23:50.694
Max.

23:55.066 --> 23:56.534
- Coming dad, coming.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.868
- Where were you?

24:02.441 --> 24:04.041
- Lookin' for Tracy.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.609
- Did you find her?

24:06.945 --> 24:07.945
- Nope.

24:09.714 --> 24:11.282
- Come on graduate.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.284
- No.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.585
None of that "come
on graduate" stuff.

24:14.587 --> 24:17.455
No dad no, not around mom.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.956
You know how she gets okay?

24:18.958 --> 24:22.126
Just play it cool,

24:28.568 --> 24:30.835
- Hey, hey!

24:30.837 --> 24:32.603
Wait wait wait.

24:32.605 --> 24:33.605
Hey wait!

24:47.686 --> 24:49.987
- Good evening young lady.

24:51.022 --> 24:52.323
What'll it be?

24:53.492 --> 24:55.493
- Um, what do you have?

24:56.795 --> 24:59.430
- Oh we've got it all.

24:59.432 --> 25:02.633
- Do you have
nestle French bars?

25:02.635 --> 25:04.468
- I'm afraid not.

25:04.470 --> 25:05.603
I'm a purest.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.906
Just regular old ice cream.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.009
Cups, cones and shakes.

25:13.545 --> 25:16.213
No store bought
confections here.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.681
- Wow really?

25:17.683 --> 25:19.750
- This is the real deal.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.630
So.

25:33.465 --> 25:34.532
What flavor?

25:36.668 --> 25:38.802
- Uh I don't know.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.504
I usually just get the bars,

25:40.506 --> 25:43.541
I'm not really an
ice cream person.

25:43.543 --> 25:47.545
- Well, today's you're
lucky day then isn't it?

25:48.680 --> 25:51.482
Time to try something new.

25:51.484 --> 25:53.117
- Can I take a look?

25:55.086 --> 25:56.487
- Sure.

25:56.489 --> 25:57.489
Come on up.

26:07.532 --> 26:09.600
- Rum raisin's my favorite.

26:09.602 --> 26:11.535
- Ew what is that?

26:11.537 --> 26:14.705
- It's probably more of
an old fashioned flavor.

26:14.707 --> 26:18.275
But then again I am
an old fashioned guy.

26:23.181 --> 26:25.749
- Oh what's this one?

26:25.751 --> 26:27.952
- That's rainbow sherbet.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.287
- Yum.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.759
- There are a lot of choices.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.762
- Oh this
one looks good.

26:43.369 --> 26:44.768
- Does it?

26:44.770 --> 26:46.604
- What are you doing?

26:46.606 --> 26:49.607
- Just giving you the
personal experience.

26:49.609 --> 26:52.743
- Yeah, no thanks I
think I'll just go.

26:52.745 --> 26:56.013
- But you haven't
picked a flavor yet?

26:57.248 --> 26:58.649
- Let me out.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.317
- What I should
just walk you out?

27:00.319 --> 27:02.019
- Let me out!

29:38.443 --> 29:39.443
- Yay!

29:41.446 --> 29:43.380
Divine, got them all.

29:43.382 --> 29:44.782
- Thanks mom.

29:44.784 --> 29:46.817
- Um guys come on, come on.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.085
It's chocolate.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.052
- You need
to have this right?

29:49.054 --> 29:50.954
- Yeah yeah.
- On your own?

30:00.732 --> 30:01.899
- Havin' fun?

30:03.268 --> 30:04.268
- Yeah.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.805
- This isn't quite
your scene is it?

30:07.807 --> 30:09.006
- Sure it is.

30:09.841 --> 30:11.708
Just takin' it all in.

30:13.778 --> 30:15.846
- You miss your husband?

30:16.948 --> 30:17.948
- Yeah.

30:20.785 --> 30:22.953
- Well if you ever had
the desire to cheat

30:22.955 --> 30:25.722
now would be the time to do it.

30:30.628 --> 30:33.063
I have a really good vibrator.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.869
- Well if you'll
excuse me I have to go

30:38.871 --> 30:40.037
find my kids.

31:08.466 --> 31:09.466
- Hey mom.

31:10.668 --> 31:12.336
How's it going?

31:13.973 --> 31:15.272
- Oh it is going.

31:16.841 --> 31:17.841
- Suburbs.

31:18.810 --> 31:19.910
Weird huh?

31:21.212 --> 31:23.480
- Yeah, I forgot how much.

31:25.083 --> 31:27.284
- It's like a big bubble.

31:30.054 --> 31:34.057
- A bubble that means
well, but still a bubble.

31:35.193 --> 31:37.861
- I can't wait to
get outta here.

31:37.863 --> 31:40.831
- Don't be in too
much of a rush.

31:42.066 --> 31:44.868
Crazy resides everywhere.

31:44.870 --> 31:46.069
- Yeah right.

31:49.374 --> 31:51.008
- Where are you going to school?

31:51.010 --> 31:52.109
- State.

31:53.111 --> 31:56.680
- Another bubble,
a bigger bubble.

31:56.682 --> 31:59.316
- Bigger is always better right?

32:01.452 --> 32:04.955
- Not always but
you'll figure that out.

32:07.358 --> 32:08.358
- Yeah?

32:09.360 --> 32:11.828
- Not at first but you will.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.068
- Hey have you seen Tracy?

32:18.070 --> 32:19.070
- No.

32:21.639 --> 32:23.573
Not since the best
part of my night.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.345
- Come on over here.

32:29.747 --> 32:30.747
- My uncle.

32:31.582 --> 32:33.784
- He looks like an uncle.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.854
- Well, to be continued.

32:41.159 --> 32:45.462
Come on uncle west let's

33:05.084 --> 33:08.151

33:10.922 --> 33:14.658
- Well now that is
a shame, cause uh.

33:24.102 --> 33:27.037
- I've had enough for one night.

33:27.039 --> 33:28.039
- Oh.

33:28.940 --> 33:29.940
Okay.

33:31.042 --> 33:35.045
- Maybe we can talk about the
meaning of life another time.

33:35.047 --> 33:39.049
- Well if you want
anymore, you know,

33:39.051 --> 33:41.985

want yard work done.

33:41.987 --> 33:43.754
She'll let me know.

33:45.289 --> 33:47.357
- You're a grass worker.

33:48.893 --> 33:51.261
- Yeah I guess, I guess I am.

33:53.564 --> 33:55.132
See you later Mary.

34:51.054 --> 34:54.524
- I could've sworn I
left that light on.

39:00.771 --> 39:02.405
- Good morning Mary.

39:05.309 --> 39:06.776
You're a runner?

39:10.181 --> 39:11.681
- More or less.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.384
- Oh how do you find the time?

39:15.986 --> 39:19.189
- Well my family's
across the country

39:19.191 --> 39:22.692
so you can find time
for lots of things.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.627
- Ah, so it would seem.

39:27.531 --> 39:31.201
- Oh you know I
found this hairpin

39:31.203 --> 39:32.469
on the ground over there.

39:32.471 --> 39:35.872
I think it's um, is it Tracy's?

39:35.874 --> 39:37.006
Max's girlfriend?

39:37.008 --> 39:39.642
- Why do you think it's Tracy's?

39:41.879 --> 39:45.582
- I remember her wearing it
the other night at the party.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.785
I dunno I just
remember those things.

39:51.522 --> 39:53.890
Okay, uh yeah well hey.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.558
If you see her.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.695
Ask he if she lost a hairpin?

39:58.697 --> 39:59.763
- Okay sure.

40:00.831 --> 40:03.733
How are things
going in the house?

40:03.735 --> 40:04.735
- Oh,

40:05.703 --> 40:07.437
good, good.

40:07.439 --> 40:09.906
You know, I drove down
with all these boxes

40:09.908 --> 40:13.343
to set everything up for the
kids before they got here but.

40:13.345 --> 40:14.844
- You drove, alone?

40:17.348 --> 40:18.348
- Yeah.

40:18.350 --> 40:20.350
- Weren't you afraid?

40:21.419 --> 40:22.419
- No.

40:25.189 --> 40:27.157
I uh, I was looking for

40:29.026 --> 40:30.627
writing inspiration

40:30.629 --> 40:33.696
and I was listening to
these great podcasts.

40:33.698 --> 40:37.667
- Well I hope you were
carrying a gun at least.

40:40.471 --> 40:43.206
- No, I don't own a gun.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.542
- Well you need to go get one.

40:45.544 --> 40:49.179
There's a lot of crazies
out there you know?

40:50.381 --> 40:52.115
- Yes, yes there are.

40:53.484 --> 40:54.617
Mhm.

40:57.888 --> 41:01.891
Uh anyway, I can't wait
for the cable company

41:01.893 --> 41:03.593
to come and hook everything up

41:03.595 --> 41:06.563
because I'm losing
my mind in there.

41:06.565 --> 41:07.464
- Yeah.

41:07.466 --> 41:08.798
- And the yard's a total mess.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.166
- Well we know.

41:11.268 --> 41:14.003
- Wait, Max does
yard work right?

41:17.475 --> 41:18.641
- Yeah he does.

41:24.014 --> 41:28.184
- No really I need somebody
to clean up the yard.

41:29.453 --> 41:31.921
So how would I book him?

41:31.923 --> 41:34.858
- I'll just have him
and his friends come by.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.793
- Oh great, thank you.

41:36.795 --> 41:41.331
I'm just so fuckin'
tired of doin' yard work.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.565
Sorry, uh sorry.

41:44.201 --> 41:46.035
- 'Kay, well I gotta run,

41:46.037 --> 41:48.271
gotta go get carpool started so.

41:48.273 --> 41:49.506
- See you later.

43:24.134 --> 43:26.703
What is it about the suburbs?

43:28.272 --> 43:29.639
Hi Jessica.

43:29.641 --> 43:31.307
How are you doing this morning?

43:31.309 --> 43:32.875
- Oh just fine.

Your husband coming soon?

43:36.146 --> 43:37.614
- Not soon enough.

43:38.916 --> 43:42.852
Still two more days for
me to get into trouble.

43:53.397 --> 43:54.397
- Hi Mary.

43:55.933 --> 43:58.501
I heard you needed yard work.

43:59.903 --> 44:01.304
- Yes, yes I do.

44:05.075 --> 44:06.576
Oh no.

44:06.578 --> 44:09.178
I actually do need yard work.

44:10.681 --> 44:11.748
- Oh, sorry.

44:12.583 --> 44:14.684
- No it's okay.

44:14.686 --> 44:16.219
I'll take that too.

44:17.955 --> 44:19.522
- This is Nick and Joe.

44:19.524 --> 44:20.524
- Hey guys.

44:23.027 --> 44:25.194
- So what did you need done?

44:28.532 --> 44:29.699

44:34.204 --> 44:37.407
Just the front yard
cleaned up a bit.

44:38.776 --> 44:40.410
Lets go take a look.

44:45.049 --> 44:47.016
Yeah it's not too bad.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.619
There's barely any lawn.

44:49.621 --> 44:51.988
I can go check the backyard

44:51.990 --> 44:54.323
and see if there are
any weeds to pull.

44:54.325 --> 44:56.626
- That's easy enough.

44:56.628 --> 44:58.061
- How much do you guys charge?

44:58.063 --> 44:59.862
- 100 bucks.

44:59.864 --> 45:03.166
- Hey we'll throw in a
little Greens for the deal.

45:03.168 --> 45:05.702
- Alright cool, sounds perfect.

45:08.372 --> 45:09.372
So um,

45:10.741 --> 45:11.808
how's Tracy?

45:14.044 --> 45:15.445
- I don't know.

45:16.580 --> 45:18.715
I haven't heard from her.

45:18.717 --> 45:20.316
She's probably just mad at me.

45:20.318 --> 45:21.084
- Really?

45:21.086 --> 45:22.752
Why?

45:22.754 --> 45:25.822
- Well she won't text me
back, she bailed on my party.

45:25.824 --> 45:29.058
- Does she have a
reason to be mad at you?

45:29.060 --> 45:31.828
- Eugh, yeah probably.

45:31.830 --> 45:33.996
- He told her he wants
to be single in college.

45:33.998 --> 45:35.164
- I'm just bein' honest.

45:35.166 --> 45:37.266
- Yep well there you go.

45:37.268 --> 45:38.868
Uh let me think,

45:38.870 --> 45:42.271
what else can I have you guys
do while you're here, um.

45:42.273 --> 45:44.107
Do you guys clean pools?

45:44.109 --> 45:47.777
Just kidding, alright
let me check the back.

45:53.050 --> 45:54.851
- Not feelin' it today boys?

45:54.853 --> 45:56.853
- It's too fuckin'
hot for this shit man.

45:56.855 --> 45:59.122
- It's called summer.

45:59.124 --> 46:01.791
- Just got a text from
brie, I'm outta here.

46:01.793 --> 46:03.059
- What?

46:03.061 --> 46:05.561
- Just take my cut of the money.

46:05.563 --> 46:07.563
- Yeah but that's twice as
much work for both of us.

46:07.565 --> 46:09.732
- Gotta get some
ass, later dudes.

46:09.734 --> 46:10.767
- Oh thanks a lot.

46:10.769 --> 46:12.635
- Nick, c'mon.
- Sorry.

46:13.470 --> 46:14.904
- Where's he goin'?

46:14.906 --> 46:19.142
- What do you call the
opposite of a gentlemen caller?

46:19.144 --> 46:20.144
- Oh.

47:09.993 --> 47:12.495
- Hello there young fellow.

47:12.497 --> 47:14.764
- Are you kidding me?

47:14.766 --> 47:17.033
- Am I kidding you about what?

47:17.035 --> 47:18.734
- Uh, your shtick.

47:20.971 --> 47:24.941
- You know, some things
in this life are sacred

47:26.310 --> 47:29.579
the ice cream truck
being one of them.

47:31.281 --> 47:35.551
Is it so wrong to make it more
special for the little kids?

47:36.954 --> 47:40.156
- So what you're
always in character?

47:40.158 --> 47:42.725
- I guess you could say that.

47:44.127 --> 47:46.596
So, what'll it be my friend?

47:49.900 --> 47:50.900
Come on up,

47:51.869 --> 47:54.537
that's where all my coolers are.

47:58.475 --> 47:59.542
What flavor?

48:10.020 --> 48:12.989
Might I suggest
pralines and cream?

48:15.659 --> 48:18.294
- Uh two chocolate cones please.

48:19.429 --> 48:22.265
- Well doesn't that
sounds delicious.

48:23.433 --> 48:26.168
- A traditionalist I see.

48:26.170 --> 48:27.637
- Yeah whatever.

49:06.276 --> 49:07.276
Oh yeah.

49:08.278 --> 49:09.278
Thanks.

49:10.414 --> 49:11.714
- Don't you want your change?

49:11.716 --> 49:13.482
- You keep it.

49:29.099 --> 49:30.232
- For me?

49:30.234 --> 49:31.701
That's so sweet.

49:42.112 --> 49:42.979
- Oh here.

49:42.981 --> 49:44.680
- Thanks baby.

49:44.682 --> 49:46.849
My parents won't be
back until Monday.

49:46.851 --> 49:48.451
Should just say you're
staying at Max's.

49:48.453 --> 49:49.453
- Okay.

49:52.089 --> 49:54.590
God what are you
trying to do to me?

49:54.592 --> 49:55.424
- Nothing.

49:55.426 --> 49:56.492
- Uh.

50:00.698 --> 50:02.164
Who's coming over?

50:02.166 --> 50:03.166
- Nobody.

50:04.134 --> 50:05.601
- You sure?

50:05.603 --> 50:07.837
- Yeah, will you
answer the door?

50:07.839 --> 50:09.805
- No way I've got a huge boner.

50:09.807 --> 50:10.807
- Uh fine.

50:19.716 --> 50:21.250
- Hello young lady.

50:24.221 --> 50:27.590
Would you mind if I
used your bathroom?

50:28.658 --> 50:29.658
- What?

50:31.128 --> 50:33.896
- I don't have one
on the truck you see.

50:33.898 --> 50:35.064
- I don't think so.

50:35.066 --> 50:36.066
I don't know you.

50:38.236 --> 50:40.169
- Fuck, let go of her.

53:30.173 --> 53:31.840
- Are you guys done?

53:31.842 --> 53:32.842
- Yeah.

53:35.212 --> 53:37.146
- Here I wrote you a check

53:37.148 --> 53:39.348
it's um, made out to cash.

53:39.350 --> 53:40.350
- Okay great.

53:42.586 --> 53:44.253
- Thanks again guys.

53:48.825 --> 53:49.825
Hi Jessica.

53:53.363 --> 53:55.631
- She is such a nosy fuck.

53:57.701 --> 53:58.701
- Yes.

54:00.170 --> 54:02.671
Okay I'll see you guys later.

54:58.662 --> 54:59.662
- Hi.
- Hey.

55:02.165 --> 55:03.165
- Great.

55:11.741 --> 55:13.409
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

55:31.361 --> 55:32.928
- It's you.

55:32.930 --> 55:33.930
- Hi.

55:35.665 --> 55:37.933
- What are you doing here?

55:39.135 --> 55:42.237
- Thought you might
be bored, or lonely.

55:44.941 --> 55:46.208
Can I come in?

55:50.948 --> 55:54.216
I forgot to give you
your pot earlier.

56:05.895 --> 56:06.895
- Okay.

56:09.499 --> 56:10.733
Come in.

56:10.735 --> 56:11.735
- Okay.

56:22.078 --> 56:23.879
- Have a seat.

56:23.881 --> 56:25.948
Can I get you something?

56:26.916 --> 56:28.550
- What have you got?

56:28.552 --> 56:29.818
- Beer, vodka.

56:31.020 --> 56:33.021
Wait a second, I can't
give you any of that.

56:33.023 --> 56:37.860
- Oh come on spare me, like you
didn't drink in high school?

56:37.862 --> 56:39.561
- Of course I did.

56:40.530 --> 56:41.930
Being around you guys,

56:41.932 --> 56:46.435
it's like a constant reminder
of my high school days.

56:46.437 --> 56:48.537
- I bet you were cute.

56:48.539 --> 56:51.774
- Stop it, I am not
giving you alcohol.

56:51.776 --> 56:53.842
- Suit yourself mom.

56:53.844 --> 56:57.312
You know technically
I'm in college now.

56:58.681 --> 57:01.583
- How about we just
smoke some pot.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.291
And then I have to go.

57:15.031 --> 57:16.365
- Go where?

57:16.367 --> 57:20.436
- Go be an adult without
a teenager in my house.

57:32.248 --> 57:35.150
- Where's the
rest of your furniture?

57:35.152 --> 57:36.452
- Movers.

57:36.454 --> 57:38.654
And I got some new stuff.

57:40.089 --> 57:41.490
Change is good.

58:09.586 --> 58:13.288
- You should sit on
the couch closer to me.

58:13.290 --> 58:15.257
- I'm cool here thanks.

58:35.945 --> 58:36.945
Sorry.

58:37.714 --> 58:39.681
- It's all good.

58:39.683 --> 58:40.683
Oh hey.

58:44.687 --> 58:45.654
It's for you.

58:45.656 --> 58:48.023
- Ah thanks, it's exciting.

59:01.705 --> 59:03.472
- I love this song.

59:05.675 --> 59:09.444
- The only music I hear
these days is Disney.

59:19.656 --> 59:22.691
- Come on Mary, be
young, dance with me.

59:22.693 --> 59:24.326
- Be young?

59:24.328 --> 59:27.529
- I really didn't
mean it like that.

59:27.531 --> 59:30.198
Come on you're cool and hotter

59:30.200 --> 59:32.634
than most of the girls my age.

59:34.671 --> 59:35.671
- You're bad.

59:39.108 --> 59:40.108
- Am I?

59:44.681 --> 59:45.681
Come on Mary.

59:55.425 --> 59:57.359
- Oh okay, yep.

59:57.361 --> 01:00:00.562
You are too young to know
how to dance like this.

01:00:00.564 --> 01:00:01.563
- No I'm not,

01:00:01.565 --> 01:00:04.299
I was raised on
dancing with the stars.

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:05.767
- Don't remind me.

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:11.340
Okay it's time for
you to go trouble.

01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:15.611
- Trouble is relative.

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:18.780
- I'm not even gonna
respond to that.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.686
- Mary Mary quite contrary.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:31.126
- Goodbye my friend,
maybe in another lifetime.

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:08.930
What?

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:11.199
- I don't have your number.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.636
- Why do you need my number?

01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:16.004
- Just in case.

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.374
- Just in case what?

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:21.309
- Look you could have mine too,

01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:23.645
you know, if you need yard work.

01:01:25.149 --> 01:01:26.682
- No.

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:28.016
- Hey.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:31.887
I can call and text first,
or I can just show up.

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:39.194
- 206

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:44.199
8471.

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:48.303
- Well that is a shitty number.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:49.071
Couldn't you have
got some repetition?

01:01:49.073 --> 01:01:50.672
- Bye, bye Max.

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:52.207
- Hey I'll text you
so you have mine.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.209
- Cool.

01:02:57.306 --> 01:02:58.306
Max?

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.866
- Mommy!

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:27.335
- Hi baby.

01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:29.805
- I can't
wait to see you.

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:31.406
- Awh.

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:32.574
One more day.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:35.343
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:38.947
- I'll go
give you 100 kisses.

01:03:38.949 --> 01:03:41.583
- I'm gonna give you 101 kisses.

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:45.921
When do you guys land again?

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:48.323
- 2:35, you
don't have to pick us up

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.425
from the airport,
I'll get a car.

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:53.361
- Okay, I'll be here waiting.

01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:56.932
I'm so excited, I
miss you guys so much.

01:03:56.934 --> 01:03:59.968
- Us too, I can't wait

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:02.871
until we're all together again.

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:03.873
- Okay.

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:08.176
I'll talk to you later, call
me if you need anything.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:09.778
- Will do, bye.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.879
- Bye.

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:57.759
- Why hello there.

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:02.397
- Hi.

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:07.702
- Would the two of you like
something this fine evening?

01:10:09.672 --> 01:10:11.372
- No thanks.

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:12.374
- You sure?

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.479
How 'bout a shake?

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:22.383
- Um,

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:24.552
sure.

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:28.389
- What flavor?

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:30.992
No, wait.

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:33.895
Lemme guess,

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.064
vanilla.

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:40.301
You look like a
vanilla kinda gal.

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:46.407
Although, tonight, you look
like you might want something

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:49.611
a little more decadent.

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:56.384
Am I wrong?

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.355
Vanilla's fine thank you.

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:03.458
- Okay, super.

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:14.969
How about you young man?

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:18.406
You wanna taste something sweet?

01:11:18.408 --> 01:11:20.275
- Nah I'm cool thanks.

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:23.211
- I can see that.

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:37.258
- You look really good tonight.

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.260
- Shh.

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:06.421
- You kids be good now you hear?

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:27.508
- Come on, let' go
this way to the park.

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:01.309
I'm really glad you
came here tonight.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.469
How's the shake?

01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:34.575
- It's good.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.780
- Can I have a sip?

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:44.085
- You can kill it.

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:35.129
- That was awesome.

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:56.551
- Did you hear that?

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:03.724
- Yeah.

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:04.992
- What was it?

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:11.165
- I don't know, relax.

01:16:11.167 --> 01:16:14.435
Probably just a
squirrel or something.

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:22.710
Hey hey, hey.

01:16:22.712 --> 01:16:24.845
- We can't do this again.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:32.720
- Why not?

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:38.125
- Because I'm old enough
to be your mother.

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:41.228
- Not really.

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:42.663
- And I'm married.

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:48.135
- You are so sexy.

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:52.940
- If I were 18.

01:16:55.644 --> 01:16:56.711
But I'm not.

01:16:59.214 --> 01:17:00.781
Life is complicated.

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:06.487
- Can I at least still see you
when your family gets here.

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:13.694
- I don't think
it's a good idea.

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:27.108
I'm sorry.

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:32.680
- Are you okay?

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:44.592
- You made me feel young again.

01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:56.237
- What the fuck?

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.774
- What is he doing?

01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:01.042
- I don't know.

01:18:01.044 --> 01:18:03.611
Let's get the fuck outta
here though Mary come on, go.

01:18:05.948 --> 01:18:07.014
Go just run!

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:17.758
Mary go keep running,
I'll draw him away.

01:18:31.206 --> 01:18:32.707
- Max!

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:34.575
- Argh!

01:18:34.577 --> 01:18:35.577

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:43.084

01:18:43.086 --> 01:18:45.920
- No!

01:20:34.095 --> 01:20:35.095
Fucker!

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:43.604
- You whore.

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:00.574
- Hey buddy.

- Yup they did.

01:23:43.019 --> 01:23:44.985
- That's good.

01:23:44.987 --> 01:23:46.353
- This is Steve.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:47.454
- Nice to meet you.

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:48.222

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:53.994
- Well it's nice
to meet all of you.

01:23:53.996 --> 01:23:56.130
I was wondering how
you occupying your time

01:23:56.132 --> 01:23:57.331
all alone in there.

01:23:57.333 --> 01:24:00.134
- Oh you know, you
can always find ways

01:24:00.136 --> 01:24:01.902
to entertain yourself.

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:05.105
- I'm sure you can.

01:24:06.741 --> 01:24:08.242
- Hey there's a pool, let's go.

01:24:08.244 --> 01:24:09.410
- Okay go on.

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:16.917
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

01:24:16.919 --> 01:24:17.885
- Me too.

01:24:17.887 --> 01:24:19.987
- I really missed you.

01:24:19.989 --> 01:24:21.789
- I missed you too.

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:27.494
- Hey Mary!

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:30.664
Your family showed up!

01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:33.200
Welcome to the neighborhood.

01:24:33.202 --> 01:24:34.935
- Thanks, who's that?

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:38.105

Seems like a nice kid.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.112
- Yeah, he is.

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:52.619
- What's this?

01:24:52.621 --> 01:24:55.022
- Oh I was doing some yard work.

01:24:55.024 --> 01:24:57.391
- You should hire
someone to do that for you.

01:24:57.393 --> 01:25:00.327
- I know, I had a
ton of free time.

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:06.967
- Mom come on
