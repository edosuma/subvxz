05:53.135 --> 05:54.354
Kathi, that's enough.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.010
Give it to me.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.955
Hey, look.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.566
She's not with child.

08:06.529 --> 08:07.617
Kathi!

08:13.884 --> 08:15.582
It's a sin.

08:18.628 --> 08:21.501
If you sin,
the Trud is summoned.

08:24.547 --> 08:25.679
Come along.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.251
Now pray.

08:37.255 --> 08:41.042
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost,
amen.

08:41.085 --> 08:44.785
Our Father,
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

10:49.518 --> 10:50.693
Come.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.582
Come in.

11:14.412 --> 11:15.762
Stop.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.459
Come on!

11:43.311 --> 11:45.182
Do you feel it
already?

11:46.357 --> 11:48.925
It's still
much too early.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.187
You barred the door?

17:41.103 --> 17:42.191
What's wrong?

17:46.239 --> 17:48.023
What is it, Kathi?

17:50.156 --> 17:51.287
I'm so scared.

17:54.812 --> 17:57.206
Something heavy
was crushing me.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.693
Help me.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.612
What have you done?

18:16.791 --> 18:20.099
'Tis your guilt
that lures the Trud.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.666
Out with it.
What have you done?

18:27.367 --> 18:29.456
You'll bring misfortune
on us all.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.112
The goat
is on your conscience.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.898
Pray.
There's nothing else for it.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.253
Come, now.

24:24.375 --> 24:30.251
No. I don't like her style...

24:30.294 --> 24:34.385
You wear too much jewelry.
They must be heavy.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.914
But I'm so strong!

24:40.957 --> 24:43.612
- Excuse me?
You're "so strong"?
- Yup.

24:43.656 --> 24:46.572
Dear girl, okay, before I joined the program today,

24:46.615 --> 24:48.312
I had heard so much about you.

24:50.619 --> 24:52.491
People are curious about you.

24:52.534 --> 24:55.102
People are asking: Is this girl for real? Or is she just acting?

24:58.801 --> 25:01.021
Yup.

25:01.064 --> 25:04.198
I think you're acting. I mean, this is not the real you.

25:04.241 --> 25:06.548
I dance too, if that's what you're asking.

25:08.289 --> 25:09.725
Do you have siblings?

25:09.769 --> 25:13.729
I do. I have an elder and a younger.

25:16.079 --> 25:17.690
So you are the middle one.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.343
And you are also the problem child at home, I presume?

25:21.476 --> 25:23.739
Uh, I'm the favorite child.

25:23.783 --> 25:28.004
You are? But parents love all their children the same.

25:28.048 --> 25:30.529
My grandmother also loves me the most.

28:55.559 --> 28:59.520
Hello.
What's up?

29:02.305 --> 29:04.003
Mmm...

29:04.046 --> 29:06.919
Good.
When do you return?

29:09.965 --> 29:12.402
I'm afraid.
I told you.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.456
Okay, forget it.

30:21.689 --> 30:24.039
No! No, don't!

31:03.731 --> 31:05.907
Okay, you wait.

35:22.381 --> 35:25.949
Okay.
Okay, Mommy is here.

35:30.954 --> 35:32.130
Ah!

36:43.375 --> 36:44.419
No.

36:48.249 --> 36:50.904
-No. No.

38:01.975 --> 38:04.499
You shall become wise...

38:06.066 --> 38:09.069
learn all
the secrets of men...

38:10.853 --> 38:14.248
and win all wars...

38:14.292 --> 38:17.947
once you consume
three hearts...

38:20.428 --> 38:23.213
of the freshly deceased.

46:24.303 --> 46:25.565
I can...

46:28.263 --> 46:31.353
present the emperor
with a drum made of her skin.

46:32.790 --> 46:35.096
As soon as the drum
resounds in battle,

46:36.097 --> 46:38.056
he shall be unconquered.

48:38.306 --> 48:40.047
Hey, dude.

48:40.091 --> 48:42.310
- Hey.
-What are you drawing?

48:43.050 --> 48:44.704
A masterpiece.

48:44.747 --> 48:48.447
Hey, are you gonna
buy Mommy a house one day?

48:48.490 --> 48:50.579
I'm gonna buy Mama a truck.

48:50.623 --> 48:54.018
-Oh, you know what Mommy needs?

48:54.061 --> 48:56.324
A Cabernet.

48:56.368 --> 48:58.239
We'll be there soon, babe.

48:58.283 --> 48:59.762
You've been saying that.

49:12.862 --> 49:14.429
Okay.
Come on, kiddo.

49:40.455 --> 49:42.718
Arnold!
Come on, bud.

49:51.858 --> 49:53.991
Can I play outside?

49:54.034 --> 49:55.514
Yeah, bud.
Of course.

49:56.515 --> 49:58.952
You wanna
go with him?Yeah.

49:59.953 --> 50:02.738
Oh!
Oh, nice swing!

50:02.782 --> 50:05.045
Ready?

50:05.089 --> 50:07.265
Now, try and hit this,
okay?

50:07.308 --> 50:08.527
Ready?

50:13.401 --> 50:14.968
Hello? This is Macie.

50:58.316 --> 51:00.405
I'll play with you,
Arnold.

51:03.016 --> 51:04.887
Who are you?

51:04.931 --> 51:06.585
My name is William.

51:06.628 --> 51:09.022
Why are you hiding?

51:09.066 --> 51:11.372
I'm good at hiding.

51:11.416 --> 51:14.027
Do you wanna play
in the woods with me?

51:14.071 --> 51:16.073
My mom will be mad.

51:16.943 --> 51:19.772
Okay, Arnold.
Maybe later.

51:38.704 --> 51:41.881
Well, there you are.
You wanna go on a hike?

51:42.621 --> 51:44.144
A hike?

51:44.188 --> 51:46.799
Come on, you'll love it.
It's an old Navajo trail.

51:46.842 --> 51:48.279
Where's your mom?

51:48.322 --> 51:50.890
Um, I don't know.
On the phone?

51:50.933 --> 51:52.413
On the deck.

51:53.327 --> 51:55.982
-Oh. We're, uh--

51:56.025 --> 51:58.941
We're going for a hike.I'll be there
in a second.

51:58.985 --> 52:01.509
I thought we weren't
doing work stuff
this weekend.

52:01.553 --> 52:03.946
I just need to do
this one thing.

52:03.990 --> 52:05.905
Whatever.

52:05.948 --> 52:09.126
Uh, so, yeah,
Mommy's just doing her thing.

52:09.169 --> 52:11.084
You ever seen
a grown man do this?

52:17.134 --> 52:20.137
-What do you think
she's talking about?
-Perfume and stuff.

52:20.180 --> 52:21.529
Yeah,
that makes sense.

52:21.573 --> 52:25.185
Okay. Okay, I gotta go.
 Bye.

52:25.229 --> 52:27.492
Sorry, boys.Ay-yi-yi.

52:29.450 --> 52:31.278
So, what was
all that about?

52:32.018 --> 52:33.628
Oh, is this a guilt trip?

52:33.672 --> 52:36.414
Yeah.
I guess it is now.

52:36.457 --> 52:39.373
You know, I never said
I was gonna close myself off
to civilization this week.

52:39.417 --> 52:41.506
You just wanna fight.

52:41.984 --> 52:43.421
Fuck off.

52:45.292 --> 52:47.120
Where's Arnold?

52:48.252 --> 52:50.341
Fuck. Arnold!

52:50.384 --> 52:51.733
Arnold!

52:53.170 --> 52:54.388
Arnold!

52:54.432 --> 52:58.000
Arnold! Where are you?
Arnold?

52:58.044 --> 53:00.916
-Arnold! Arnold!
-Arnold? Arnold!

53:02.744 --> 53:04.181
Arnold!

53:05.225 --> 53:07.358
-You need help?
-Uh, yeah.

53:07.401 --> 53:09.360
Our boy, we lost him.
He was right here.

53:09.403 --> 53:11.971
Come on, buddy.Uh, Arnold!

53:12.014 --> 53:14.452
-How old is he?
-Uh, six.

53:14.495 --> 53:15.931
-Oh, shit.
-Arnold! Come out!

53:15.975 --> 53:18.804
-Arnold!
- I'm over here!

53:18.847 --> 53:21.023
Arnold.

53:21.067 --> 53:23.635
-I was peeing!

53:23.678 --> 53:26.246
You can't pee out there, son.

53:26.290 --> 53:27.682
Come on back, bud.

53:29.858 --> 53:31.860
Better watch your boy.

53:38.171 --> 53:40.042
You having fun, bud?

53:40.086 --> 53:42.654
I made a new friend
today.

53:44.351 --> 53:45.961
A friend?

53:46.658 --> 53:48.181
Who's your friend?

53:48.225 --> 53:50.488
William.
He hides in the woods.

53:52.403 --> 53:54.361
Uh--

53:54.405 --> 53:57.234
Uh, where did you meet
William, sweetie?

53:58.496 --> 54:01.586
In the backyard,
while you were on the phone.

54:02.978 --> 54:05.154
Did you see William?

54:05.198 --> 54:07.592
I could only see
a part of him.

54:07.635 --> 54:11.422
Well, which...
which part of him,
sweetie?

54:11.465 --> 54:15.252
His face was hard to see
and his clothes were all dirty.

54:15.295 --> 54:17.732
Is William a little boy?

54:19.168 --> 54:20.257
Yes.

54:21.301 --> 54:24.696
Okay, is...
is William imaginary?

54:24.739 --> 54:25.914
I don't think so.

54:27.612 --> 54:31.006
You remember
your friend Randy, right?Yeah.

54:31.050 --> 54:32.704
Is he like Randy?

54:33.792 --> 54:35.533
Not really.

54:35.576 --> 54:37.622
But kind of
like Randy?

54:37.665 --> 54:40.146
-Maybe a little bit.
-Okay.

54:40.189 --> 54:42.888
Well,
Randy was imaginary.

54:42.931 --> 54:45.412
Do you remember that?Yes.

54:45.456 --> 54:48.197
Yeah? Is that
what William is too?

54:51.462 --> 54:52.593
Yes.

54:54.291 --> 54:56.380
Okay. All right.

54:56.423 --> 54:59.557
Hey, it's okay
to have imaginary friends.

54:59.600 --> 55:01.820
We just wanna know
who they are.

55:01.863 --> 55:03.604
Okay, bud?Okay.

55:03.648 --> 55:05.214
Okay.

55:09.958 --> 55:12.134
Get in bed, sucka!

55:12.178 --> 55:14.311
Dad!I ain't kiddin' around.

55:14.354 --> 55:16.313
I got a surprise.What is it?

55:16.356 --> 55:18.053
I'll ask the questions
around here.

55:18.097 --> 55:21.318
Now, you get in bed
or you'll never know.Fine.

55:22.275 --> 55:23.929
What's my surprise?

55:24.582 --> 55:27.367
It's my...

55:27.411 --> 55:28.629
tablet!

55:28.673 --> 55:30.283
Cool!Yeah!

55:30.327 --> 55:33.330
Here. Just pop these things
in your ears there. Okay?

55:34.722 --> 55:37.508
All right?
And you're good to go.Okay.

55:37.551 --> 55:39.597
Good night, boss.Night.

55:44.384 --> 55:46.168
Hey, LensCrafters.

55:48.519 --> 55:50.216
You wanna mess around?

55:52.174 --> 55:53.393
Get over here.

56:27.514 --> 56:29.560
Arnold.

56:32.389 --> 56:35.087
Come play with us tonight,
Arnold.

56:35.130 --> 56:38.177
My mom and dad said
you're not real.

56:38.220 --> 56:40.309
Then they'll never know.

56:42.790 --> 56:44.836
What's wrong with your head?

56:44.879 --> 56:46.185
Nothing's wrong, Arnold.

56:48.753 --> 56:50.842
Let's go have some fun.

56:59.372 --> 57:01.461
Arnold? Arnold!

57:01.505 --> 57:03.332
Where the fuck is he?

57:03.376 --> 57:06.161
Chris!
Chris, come in here!

57:07.032 --> 57:08.337
Chris!

57:08.381 --> 57:10.035
Oh, fuck.What?
Jesus Christ!

57:10.078 --> 57:12.254
He's gone!
H-He's gone!

57:13.517 --> 57:14.605
Arnold?

57:15.997 --> 57:17.129
Call the cops.

57:26.834 --> 57:28.009
Arnold!

57:33.275 --> 57:34.494
Arnold!

57:36.975 --> 57:38.455
Arnold!

57:39.717 --> 57:41.022
Arnold!

57:41.066 --> 57:42.415
Arnold!

57:42.459 --> 57:44.373
Arnold!

57:44.417 --> 57:46.593
Arnold! Arnold!

57:46.637 --> 57:48.160
Arnold!

57:53.426 --> 57:54.732
Arnold!

58:05.569 --> 58:06.744
Arnold.

58:32.944 --> 58:34.902
Where is Arnold?

58:45.086 --> 58:47.785
What did you do to him?

58:49.134 --> 58:52.180
We crawled inside his brain,
Daddy.

58:58.752 --> 59:00.841
Good boy, William.

59:07.108 --> 59:10.416
Now, eat, little Arnold.
Let Daddy see.

59:11.765 --> 59:13.288
No.

59:16.944 --> 59:19.338
Arnold!

59:19.381 --> 59:23.255
Can you see your boy, Daddy?
He's doing very well.

59:26.867 --> 59:29.000
No. No!

59:29.043 --> 59:30.088
No!

01:00:45.424 --> 01:00:48.383
What happened to
Panagas the pagan?

01:00:51.212 --> 01:00:53.562
What the hell happened,
Panagas?

01:00:56.043 --> 01:00:58.132
What happened to us?

01:00:58.176 --> 01:01:01.353
It was Christmas.
Always fucking Christmas.

01:01:01.396 --> 01:01:04.661
We'd been drinking since
the break of dawn.

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:08.490
"We're gonna burn this island to the ground!"

01:01:08.534 --> 01:01:12.320
We screamed, "More wine!"

01:01:12.364 --> 01:01:16.498
Wine was sweating
from our pores.
Our minds had left us.

01:01:16.542 --> 01:01:21.590
Every stinking Christmas with Panagas, always the same.

01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:31.818
It was December of 1984
when the goblin sneaked
into our village...

01:01:31.862 --> 01:01:34.125
and into
our festive frenzies.

01:01:34.168 --> 01:01:36.997
He thought he could walk
unseen among us.

01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:49.357
Louder! Louder!

01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:54.188
Louder!

01:01:54.232 --> 01:01:57.670
You old deaf bastard!
Louder!

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:01.326
No more, Panagas.
I've had enough
and so have you.

01:02:01.369 --> 01:02:04.546
Go home to your woman,
if she'll have you.

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:07.332
Come on, old man!
Play the stupid thing!

01:02:11.553 --> 01:02:13.991
We've got a ghetto blaster!

01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:17.298
All the way up!

01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:19.736
Put it all the way!

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:42.541
You're gonna stand there
and eat alone, you bastard?

01:02:42.584 --> 01:02:44.499
Don't want to share?

01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:47.938
Who are you?
That you, Mr. Dimos?

01:02:47.981 --> 01:02:50.897
Shut up, Placenta.
Shut up.

01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:52.594
Mr. Dimos, my ass.

01:02:52.638 --> 01:02:54.988
Why don't you lose
the hood?

01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:57.686
Lose the hood
so we can feast on you.

01:02:58.383 --> 01:03:00.428
I got him! I got him!

01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:03.692
Get back here, man!

01:03:04.128 --> 01:03:05.694
I got you!

01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:09.046
Get over here.

01:03:09.089 --> 01:03:10.961
Who are you?

01:03:13.615 --> 01:03:16.531
Take it off.

01:03:18.055 --> 01:03:20.579
Come on. Take it off.

01:03:20.622 --> 01:03:23.147
Up! Up! Up!

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:27.281
Do I know you?

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.851
Where the fuck
did you come from?

01:03:31.895 --> 01:03:34.419
Holy shit.
Are you from the Land Below?

01:03:34.462 --> 01:03:37.422
Shut up, man.
You don't know
shit about shit.

01:03:37.465 --> 01:03:39.990
But you will.
You'll see!

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:51.305
A goblin! A goblin!

01:03:54.439 --> 01:03:57.224
- To the hole!

01:03:57.268 --> 01:03:59.966
Let's fuck that goblin up!

01:04:05.754 --> 01:04:09.846
They call it
"The Hole," "The Burrow,"
"The Land Below."

01:04:13.153 --> 01:04:16.330
They say a fire burns
blue there, a frozen flame,

01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:18.985
the place where the goblins, little devils,

01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:21.031
the children of
the Goat are born.

01:04:22.554 --> 01:04:25.905
In the Hole you are neither
dead nor alive.

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:28.038
Devoid of thought
and purpose.

01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:30.431
To love
the Blue Flame only.

01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:36.220
That's what they say,
but no one has ever
come back to tell the tale.

01:05:00.635 --> 01:05:02.507
To the Hole!

01:05:03.377 --> 01:05:05.205
To the Hole.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.576
Get him, Peristeri.

01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:33.407
Get to it, boy.

01:05:39.022 --> 01:05:40.327
To the Hole!

01:05:46.899 --> 01:05:50.163
-To the Hole!

01:06:03.916 --> 01:06:08.007
Don't cry about it
like a little girl.

01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:11.010
I can't even look at you.
Get out of my sight.

01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:12.794
Get out of here, Peristeri!

01:06:12.838 --> 01:06:14.796
Go get the priest!

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.624
Go fetch
Zolotas the priest!

01:06:16.668 --> 01:06:19.062
Go fetch
Zolotas the priest!

01:06:19.105 --> 01:06:22.761
The Hole is about to open up.
It's splitting.

01:06:51.572 --> 01:06:53.096
Priest Zolotas...

01:06:55.359 --> 01:06:59.319
They call him the White Man, the Exorcist, the Heretic.

01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:01.539
I call him a bastard.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:05.891
He's coming to fuck that goblin up, and he'll take his time too.

01:07:10.287 --> 01:07:13.116
They're all gonna
take their time
with the goblin.

01:07:15.814 --> 01:07:17.337
Like a communion.

01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:20.123
Like the Lord's supper.

01:07:21.428 --> 01:07:23.126
Take him.

01:07:23.865 --> 01:07:25.476
Take him.

01:08:04.776 --> 01:08:07.170
What do you want from me?

01:08:07.213 --> 01:08:10.651
Wine! Wine! Wine! Wine!

01:08:10.695 --> 01:08:14.307
Wine! Wine! Wine! Wine!

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:36.372
What do you want from me?

01:08:54.216 --> 01:08:58.046
Wine! Wine! Wine! Wine!

01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:00.136
Wine! Wine!

01:09:24.421 --> 01:09:27.598
They say
the blood of the goblin
drives you mad.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.469
They say it tastes
like Blue Flame.

01:09:31.776 --> 01:09:36.345
Where are you, Panagas?

01:09:38.348 --> 01:09:44.484
The Hole is open!

01:09:48.358 --> 01:09:52.144
Leave, Panagas!

01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:01.545
Where are you from,
brother?

01:10:01.588 --> 01:10:04.591
Did ou come from
the Land Below?

01:10:20.564 --> 01:10:23.871
Panagas!

01:10:58.341 --> 01:11:01.909
Panagas was our leader
and now he follows.

01:11:01.953 --> 01:11:05.043
He follows the Blue Flame.

01:11:05.086 --> 01:11:08.699
In muddy waters,
he's been baptized a pagan.

01:11:08.742 --> 01:11:12.355
Now, far away from
our sorrows and feasts.

01:11:20.319 --> 01:11:23.844
Nobody saw a goblin
on the island again.

01:11:28.893 --> 01:11:31.809
Panagas was gone too.
Vanished.

01:11:34.855 --> 01:11:37.467
He's in the Land Below now.

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:42.863
Deep inside the Hole.

01:12:31.651 --> 01:12:33.392
Of the events that took place

01:12:33.436 --> 01:12:36.656
during that summer of 1913
in West Bengal...

01:12:39.006 --> 01:12:41.182
I have no desire to speak.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.015
I am infected by those...
horrific events.

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.068
I cannot get them
out of my head.

01:12:57.111 --> 01:12:59.157
Come on, faster!

01:13:00.724 --> 01:13:03.422
You both
are being lazy.

01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:05.555
You could hardly
understand H.B. Gentry

01:13:05.598 --> 01:13:07.600
if you hadn't been
to India yourself.

01:13:08.949 --> 01:13:14.259
He craved this disturbing
paradise of exaggeration.

01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:19.090
I was his assistant
in those days.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:25.052
Gentry was an agent
for the American
Circus Corporation.

01:13:25.096 --> 01:13:31.189
He would ship Bengal tigers and whatever else he could find for the Ringling Brothers.

01:13:31.232 --> 01:13:34.322
So this king was utterly insane.

01:13:34.366 --> 01:13:36.716
He cut off pieces of himself

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.154
and sat on his throne
with most
of his body parts gone.

01:13:42.766 --> 01:13:44.245
Mumbo-jumbo.

01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:47.945
Two bloody days
had better be worth it.

01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:51.644
The king bring them
for his pleasure, Mr. Gentry.

01:13:51.688 --> 01:13:54.691
You can fill your circuses
with them.

01:13:55.387 --> 01:13:57.128
Who takes care of them?

01:13:57.998 --> 01:13:59.478
There it is.

01:14:01.611 --> 01:14:05.266
Barnum used to say
Gentry had this
incredible gift of sight.

01:14:09.749 --> 01:14:11.795
That he had the strength

01:14:11.838 --> 01:14:14.406
to look at things
that others
could not stomach.

01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:22.936
That's why
they sent him out there.

01:14:31.902 --> 01:14:33.207
Tell them...

01:14:34.992 --> 01:14:36.210
Sir!

01:14:36.254 --> 01:14:37.603
Come this way!
Come this way!

01:14:37.647 --> 01:14:39.431
Sir, we won't go any further.Come this way!

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:41.651
You'll get beaten up
if you throw tantrums.

01:14:57.928 --> 01:14:59.756
Sir! Listen, sir!

01:15:00.626 --> 01:15:03.542
-Listen, sir.
- What?

01:15:03.586 --> 01:15:05.718
Give us our money here
and we will go back.

01:15:05.762 --> 01:15:08.242
I'll give!
I'llgive! I'll give!

01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:11.419
We won't go, sir.
We won't go.
We are going back.

01:15:11.463 --> 01:15:15.249
- Don't create a fuss now.
- Oh, God!
No, we won't go, sir!

01:15:15.293 --> 01:15:17.034
Sir, we won't be able
to go ahead.

01:15:17.077 --> 01:15:18.688
That's a lot
of wild story.

01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:22.213
The freaks survived, Jim,
nd that's all that matters.

01:15:22.256 --> 01:15:24.911
We can't go ahead, sir.
We won't go!

01:15:25.782 --> 01:15:27.914
Listen! Both of you!No, no.

01:15:27.958 --> 01:15:31.701
It scares us.Rascals!

01:15:53.592 --> 01:15:56.203
Tell her.
Tell her that.

01:15:58.118 --> 01:16:00.817
They're saying
that the creatures
will be well taken care of.

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:02.775
These are God's children.

01:16:02.819 --> 01:16:04.603
What did she say?

01:16:04.647 --> 01:16:07.693
Can they buy them?
They'll pay good money.

01:16:09.956 --> 01:16:12.524
Tell her that
the creatures will be
well taken care of.

01:16:15.658 --> 01:16:18.225
Come on, James.
For God's sake.

01:16:18.269 --> 01:16:19.792
I didn't pay you
to be sick.

01:16:21.664 --> 01:16:23.927
Can they buy them?

01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:26.886
They'll pay good money.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.678
How much just to see them?

01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:38.158
Mr. Gentry,
don't waver now.

01:16:54.087 --> 01:16:55.132
Remarkable.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:57.700
Good Lord.

01:16:59.484 --> 01:17:01.225
Oh, God.

01:17:01.268 --> 01:17:04.097
Oh, my God.

01:17:16.066 --> 01:17:18.285
My God, what was that?

01:17:20.461 --> 01:17:21.593
Open it.

01:17:23.551 --> 01:17:25.379
Don't open that!

01:17:25.423 --> 01:17:28.731
Mr. Gentry,
there is a shrine inside.
It is not for us.

01:17:29.819 --> 01:17:31.821
Oh, for God's sakes,
you're a man of science.

01:17:31.864 --> 01:17:35.259
That houses a holy being.
One cannot worship it directly.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.654
I need to see it.

01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:40.177
Come on. Pay her.

01:17:42.092 --> 01:17:45.269
You cannot look
upon it. It is beyond what
human vision can take.

01:18:05.028 --> 01:18:07.421
This should be enough
for three years.

01:18:07.465 --> 01:18:10.076
We'll ship them
to London next week.

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.035
Would you travel back with us?

01:18:12.078 --> 01:18:14.080
Gentry says we stay
until the morning.

01:18:15.865 --> 01:18:18.694
I don't recommend
you and Mr. Gentry

01:18:18.737 --> 01:18:19.825
to stay back here.

01:18:35.754 --> 01:18:37.713
We'll do this tonight,
Jim.

01:18:39.889 --> 01:18:43.936
Their gods are real.
I'm not going to do it.

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:45.938
Goddamn you, Jim.

01:18:47.287 --> 01:18:48.767
I'm not paying you
a dime.

01:19:20.494 --> 01:19:22.148
I hated Gentry.

01:19:24.585 --> 01:19:28.372
His quest for novel scenes
and perverse spectacles

01:19:28.415 --> 01:19:30.766
was feverish and insatiate.

01:19:34.334 --> 01:19:36.162
I often wished him dead.

01:20:33.437 --> 01:20:35.265
If heaven is merciful,

01:20:35.308 --> 01:20:38.572
it will someday efface
from my consciousness...

01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:42.925
the sight
that I saw that night...

01:20:47.886 --> 01:20:50.410
and let me live
my last years in peace.

01:21:46.162 --> 01:21:47.293
Gentry!

01:21:48.555 --> 01:21:49.905
Gentry!

01:22:13.406 --> 01:22:15.974
Heaven be thanked
for the instinct
which led me...

01:22:17.367 --> 01:22:18.455
to a most...

01:22:19.238 --> 01:22:20.848
peaceful sleep...

01:22:23.547 --> 01:22:26.202
under the calm stars
of clear skies.

01:22:28.421 --> 01:22:31.294
God, I crave a sleep

01:22:31.337 --> 01:22:33.165
whose dreams
I should not remember.

01:22:35.689 --> 01:22:39.389
Now I lay me down to sleep.

01:22:39.432 --> 01:22:40.825
I close my eyes.

01:22:40.868 --> 01:22:42.653
I pray the Lord...

01:22:42.696 --> 01:22:45.569
When I opened them, I was in a Calcutta hospital...

01:22:45.612 --> 01:22:47.397
...my soul to keep.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.007
...singing a great deal.

01:22:49.051 --> 01:22:52.315
If I should die
before I wake...

01:22:52.358 --> 01:22:55.579
And laughing oddly,
but unable to sing.

01:22:55.622 --> 01:22:59.452
...I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

01:22:59.496 --> 01:23:01.367
Amen.

01:24:23.754 --> 01:24:24.972
Good boy, Wachter.

01:24:27.497 --> 01:24:29.803
Tomorrow we will
hunt something.

01:25:52.277 --> 01:25:54.714
Anni?

01:26:58.474 --> 01:27:00.040
My dearest.

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:27.198
Brother,
I had a terrible dream.

01:27:28.634 --> 01:27:30.897
Our cow Minka...

01:27:46.217 --> 01:27:48.306
Now the Drude bit you too.

01:28:31.088 --> 01:28:34.265
What if our last cow
dies as well?

01:28:35.266 --> 01:28:37.050
We will find a solution.

01:28:37.094 --> 01:28:40.358
You will not survive
another winter up here.

01:28:40.402 --> 01:28:42.578
Go down to the valley.
The snow will come soon.

01:28:42.621 --> 01:28:44.493
I will not leave you
here alone.

01:28:46.233 --> 01:28:48.323
Do you want to end up
like our parents?

01:28:50.281 --> 01:28:53.197
Do you know how much energy
it takes to control her?

01:28:55.155 --> 01:28:58.333
Soon nothing will be left
of the good Anni.

01:28:59.725 --> 01:29:02.728
There is only one way out.

01:29:08.386 --> 01:29:10.214
We need to put
an end to this.

01:29:40.113 --> 01:29:41.637
Wachter?

01:29:50.123 --> 01:29:52.952
-Wachter, come here!

01:29:54.127 --> 01:29:57.000
-Here, I said!

01:30:00.482 --> 01:30:02.788
-Begone!

01:30:02.832 --> 01:30:04.964
Shh!

01:31:02.979 --> 01:31:04.197
Wachter!

01:31:07.766 --> 01:31:09.681
Come here!

01:31:32.356 --> 01:31:34.140
My good boy.

01:31:50.026 --> 01:31:52.594
Did you take good care
of our cow Liesl?

01:31:54.291 --> 01:31:56.336
Leave me alone,
you witch.

01:32:50.608 --> 01:32:52.828
