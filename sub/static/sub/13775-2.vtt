WEBVTT

00:01.156 --> 00:04.368
Guys, football is back,
it's the first game of the season.

00:04.437 --> 00:06.371
It's like nothing else matters now.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.683
Yes, come on.

00:07.793 --> 00:09.596
Are you kidding me?

00:09.665 --> 00:10.597
Ogletree.

00:10.666 --> 00:13.706
This guy picks up Ogletree off the
waiver wire, then, boom, two touchdowns.

00:13.775 --> 00:14.655
I got a little system.

00:14.656 --> 00:15.938
Look, Pete, we all have systems.

00:16.006 --> 00:17.875
Yeah, but my system actually works.

00:17.944 --> 00:18.711
Really?

00:18.779 --> 00:20.859
Yeah, look, I just look at
all the players that are

00:20.860 --> 00:24.019
available, I give them plus
ones or minus ones for all the

00:24.087 --> 00:26.523
attributes, and it actually
kind of works for women, too.

00:26.592 --> 00:27.357
How so?

00:27.426 --> 00:29.960
Look, we all know, after the
draft, there's not too much

00:30.029 --> 00:32.063
talent left on the free
agency market, right?

00:32.131 --> 00:34.692
The same thing is true for women
after the age of 28 'cause all

00:34.693 --> 00:36.300
the good ones are basically taken.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.803
Yeah, they've been drafted
to other people's teams.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.774
And those who are left, myself
included, have a ton of baggage.

00:41.843 --> 00:44.778
Maybe it's a bad hamstring, maybe
she's got daddy issues, you know.

00:44.847 --> 00:47.287
This allows me to ferret it all
out and make the right pick.

00:47.356 --> 00:49.596
Wait a second, so you live
your dating life like you're

00:49.597 --> 00:51.554
just choosing someone off the waiver wire?

00:51.622 --> 00:52.422
Pretty much, yeah.

00:52.490 --> 00:53.770
I mean, look, here's an example.

00:53.771 --> 00:55.393
These three nice ladies over here.

00:55.461 --> 00:57.328
The one in the middle...
she's beautiful.

00:57.397 --> 00:59.597
That gives her a plus two,
but look closely under the

00:59.666 --> 01:01.467
fingernails... there's some chalk.

01:01.536 --> 01:03.656
Means she's probably a
teacher, has to get up early.

01:03.657 --> 01:05.272
That's a big minus one for me.

01:05.340 --> 01:09.143
Also, very expensive necklace... not
affordable on a teacher's salary.

01:09.212 --> 01:10.492
That means she's probably taken.

01:10.493 --> 01:12.846
That gives her a minus two,
which means I got to find

01:12.915 --> 01:15.317
another player to pick up.

01:15.386 --> 01:16.318
Wow.

01:16.387 --> 01:17.187
Hey there, I'm Pete.

01:17.222 --> 01:17.987
How's it going?

01:18.056 --> 01:19.089
Hey. Milana.

01:19.157 --> 01:21.397
No, I could never do this
because I'm not good at math.

01:21.427 --> 01:22.960
I'd lose track of the numbers.

01:23.029 --> 01:24.069
Can't believe that worked.

01:24.070 --> 01:25.964
Hold on, I'm gonna try this.

01:26.033 --> 01:29.602
I'm gonna pick up Kevin's
beer off the waiver wire.

01:29.670 --> 01:31.704
No, that's just stealing,
Taco, it's theft.

01:32.773 --> 01:35.641
I don't have time to teach
you how to play fantasy football.

01:35.709 --> 01:37.309
Plus one, minus one.

01:37.378 --> 01:39.312
And zero.

01:39.432 --> 01:44.339

01:44.625 --> 01:45.945
So, how's the new pediatrician?

01:46.071 --> 01:47.837
Dr. Levenson is fantastic.

01:47.906 --> 01:48.838
Good.

01:48.907 --> 01:50.240
Ellie has a rash, though.

01:50.309 --> 01:51.549
Probably gonna have to go back.

01:52.545 --> 01:54.825
And then next week we're
gonna have to bring Christopher

01:54.848 --> 01:55.947
in for his circumcision.

01:56.016 --> 02:01.199
What, wait... circumcision?

02:01.319 --> 02:02.475
We're, we're doing that?

02:02.595 --> 02:03.284
Why wouldn't we?

02:03.352 --> 02:05.920
Because we haven't even had
a discussion about it.

02:05.989 --> 02:07.154
What is there to talk about?

02:07.223 --> 02:08.389
What is there to talk about?

02:08.458 --> 02:10.792
I mean, you're taking a piece of him away.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.128
Yeah, then folding it back.

02:12.196 --> 02:16.399
No, chopped off and then taken
to some foreskin wonderland.

02:16.468 --> 02:17.268
Okay, you know what?

02:17.302 --> 02:19.236
We're not done discussing this yet.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.585
I haven't made my full argument.

02:20.653 --> 02:23.133
I'm gonna go to the restroom,
collect my thoughts, and when I

02:23.134 --> 02:24.934
come back, we'll continue
this conversation.

02:24.935 --> 02:27.245
Okay, you do that.

02:32.049 --> 02:33.085
Just one?

02:33.154 --> 02:35.090
I can do this in one.

02:35.091 --> 02:38.291
What's it like being counsel for Taco
Corp now that he actually has some money?

02:38.360 --> 02:40.680
There are more meetings, and
they're longer, and he keeps

02:40.681 --> 02:43.121
talking about some corporate
retreat, which I know is just a

02:43.122 --> 02:44.202
sweat lodge at Burning Man.

02:44.267 --> 02:46.167
Coming through.

02:46.235 --> 02:47.168
Hey, guys.

02:48.404 --> 02:50.605
I am loving this waiver wire stuff.

02:50.674 --> 02:51.754
What's with the bike, Taco?

02:51.755 --> 02:55.177
That was on some guy's front porch,
and I picked it up off the waiver wire.

02:55.246 --> 02:56.011
That's stealing.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.115
And now I'm going to pick this plate
up off the waiver wire as well.

02:59.183 --> 03:00.023
That's also stealing.

03:00.024 --> 03:00.783
Hey, guys.

03:00.852 --> 03:01.852
Hey, Sutton, how are you?

03:01.853 --> 03:02.518
Hey, what's up?

03:02.587 --> 03:03.353
Good to see you.

03:03.421 --> 03:04.187
How you been?

03:04.256 --> 03:05.021
Hey, good... hey.

03:05.090 --> 03:06.690
Hey, good to see... Andre, please.

03:06.758 --> 03:07.524
No, it's okay.

03:07.593 --> 03:08.358
Thank you.

03:08.427 --> 03:09.193
What's going on?

03:09.261 --> 03:11.021
I haven't seen you and
Roger around lately.

03:11.030 --> 03:12.863
Yeah, you guys don't know.

03:12.932 --> 03:13.697
We broke up.

03:13.766 --> 03:14.532
Sorry.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.533
Wow.

03:15.601 --> 03:16.721
No, no, I-it's totally fine.

03:16.736 --> 03:18.569
We, we just weren't right for each other.

03:18.638 --> 03:20.504
You guys are just having sex now?

03:20.573 --> 03:23.074
No, no, I... Clean break.

03:23.142 --> 03:26.310
Okay, well, anyhow, welcome to the
terrible world of being single.

03:26.379 --> 03:27.179
No, I am so excited.

03:27.213 --> 03:29.046
I can't wait to just get back out there.

03:29.115 --> 03:29.915
We'll catch up soon.

03:29.949 --> 03:30.715
Yeah, totally.

03:30.783 --> 03:31.823
It's good to see you guys.

03:31.824 --> 03:32.483
Good to see you.

03:32.552 --> 03:33.317
Yeah, see you.

03:33.386 --> 03:35.186
Bye.

03:35.254 --> 03:37.087
I'll, I'll bump you a text.

03:37.156 --> 03:40.023
Sutton is suddenly single, guys.

03:40.092 --> 03:41.591
So she's on the waiver wire.

03:41.660 --> 03:43.894
Yeah, and who will pick her up first?

03:43.962 --> 03:44.728
I got priority.

03:44.797 --> 03:45.717
She talked to me first.

03:45.786 --> 03:47.906
She hugged me, she grabbed
my elbow before she left.

03:47.907 --> 03:48.627
You're kidding me.

03:48.628 --> 03:49.432
I have priority.

03:49.501 --> 03:51.201
I haven't touched a boob in, like, a year.

03:51.269 --> 03:52.189
I should have priority.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.870
I masturbated to her, like, six years ago.

03:53.939 --> 03:55.699
Taco, you have a bike,
you have a sandwich.

03:55.734 --> 03:56.934
That's enough, okay? Honestly.

03:57.909 --> 03:58.708
You're disgusting.

03:58.776 --> 04:00.509
I dropped the sandwich.

04:00.578 --> 04:03.278
As your commissioner, I believe
that I should weigh in on this.

04:03.347 --> 04:05.113
You're not our life commissioner.

04:05.182 --> 04:08.142
I am indeed your life
commissioner, and in so I have

04:08.143 --> 04:09.383
decided that Pete has priority.

04:10.453 --> 04:13.020
Bullshit... no, no, no, no, you
can't tell me what to do.

04:13.089 --> 04:14.121
You're not a god.

04:14.189 --> 04:16.255
I'm the closest thing to
God you shits ever got.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.423
She wants to chop the top
of my son's dick off!

04:18.493 --> 04:20.059
Hello, Kevin, nice to see you, too.

04:20.128 --> 04:22.896
Jenny wants to rip the foreskin
off of baby Christopher.

04:22.964 --> 04:24.364
Chalupa Batman.

04:24.433 --> 04:26.800
Fine. You know, it's unthinkable to me.

04:26.869 --> 04:29.369
I mean, it's archaic and unnecessary.

04:29.438 --> 04:31.272
As a doctor, it is not archaic.

04:31.340 --> 04:32.106
It's very common.

04:32.175 --> 04:35.409
Foreskin is a McArthur family
tradition like alcoholism.

04:35.478 --> 04:36.444
Look, show you.

04:36.512 --> 04:37.445
What are you doing?

04:37.514 --> 04:38.446
Yeah, look at that.

04:38.515 --> 04:39.614
Just, just hold on.

04:39.683 --> 04:40.923
I'm just gonna give an example.

04:40.984 --> 04:43.284
Look how beautiful and smooth this looks.

04:43.353 --> 04:44.085
A hoodie.

04:44.154 --> 04:45.119
How do you wash it?

04:45.188 --> 04:45.820
It's easy.

04:45.889 --> 04:48.089
You just got to get in
there with soap and water.

04:48.158 --> 04:48.923
Scrub it up.

04:48.992 --> 04:51.792
Guys, guys, guys, I'm
not a human dick, okay?

04:51.861 --> 04:53.961
I think history has proven otherwise.

04:54.029 --> 04:54.869
But here's the thing.

04:54.870 --> 04:57.665
For me, why even bother with washing
it when it can be down here?

04:57.733 --> 05:00.067
I mean, that's what you want
to have sex with, right?

05:00.135 --> 05:02.402
You got a Corvette, you
rock it with the top down.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.605
Well, I like my hoodie up, like
Belichick on a cold December Sunday.

05:05.674 --> 05:08.114
All right, fine, The McAsterisk
boys have made their claims.

05:08.144 --> 05:09.743
Obviously, we know where we stand.

05:09.812 --> 05:10.845
Andre, where are you at?

05:10.913 --> 05:11.746
To each his own.

05:11.815 --> 05:13.621
Well, what are you, cut or uncut?

05:13.622 --> 05:14.582
You guys are ridiculous.

05:14.591 --> 05:17.431
Why are you sipping water like you're
testifying in front of Congress?

05:17.499 --> 05:20.299
'Cause it's personal and it's private
and it's none of your business.

05:20.300 --> 05:21.620
Andre, you blog about everything.

05:21.621 --> 05:23.165
I don't blog about everything.

05:23.166 --> 05:24.966
I blog about magic and
sometimes Don Henley.

05:24.967 --> 05:27.127
Is this weird that we've
known you for literally this

05:27.128 --> 05:29.168
long and we don't know what
your penis looks like?

05:29.232 --> 05:32.099
But you threw him in the lake
nude when we were in high school.

05:32.168 --> 05:33.835
Yeah, I wasn't looking at his crotch.

05:33.903 --> 05:35.637
You didn't want to cheat on Kevin.

05:35.705 --> 05:38.306
I've seen his balls a few
times, but never his dick.

05:38.375 --> 05:41.008
Guys, you're perverts, all
right, and it's none of your

05:41.077 --> 05:44.979
business and you'll never know,
and that's it, case closed.

05:45.048 --> 05:48.049
As the Commissioner, I demand to
know what your penis looks like!

05:48.118 --> 05:49.998
Okay, I'm recusing myself
from this situation.

05:49.999 --> 05:51.786
Thank you very much.

05:51.854 --> 05:53.848
And I'm taking your bike.

05:54.097 --> 05:56.062
No, no, no, you do not have priority.

05:56.182 --> 05:57.391
Thank you.

06:00.045 --> 06:00.959
What's with Ruxin?

06:01.079 --> 06:01.956
Is he walking again?

06:02.076 --> 06:06.089
Yeah, yeah, he's walking, sleeping
in a crypt, afraid of garlic.

06:06.325 --> 06:11.128
He came in last place in the league,
which, by the way, I won last year.

06:11.248 --> 06:12.614
I won the Shiva,

06:12.682 --> 06:13.448
Congratulations.

06:13.516 --> 06:14.215
Thank you.

06:14.284 --> 06:15.293
Also kind of creepy.

06:15.413 --> 06:16.813
No, you're taking it the wrong way.

06:16.814 --> 06:18.700
I won you! I own you!

06:18.820 --> 06:19.920
Way worse, in fact.

06:19.989 --> 06:20.921
Why?

06:20.990 --> 06:23.257
Kevin, your trophy is the Shiva.

06:23.325 --> 06:25.092
I am Shiva.

06:25.161 --> 06:29.297
I am not a sloppily made
symbol of your lost youth.

06:29.366 --> 06:30.699
Fine. I'm sorry.

06:30.768 --> 06:32.200
I didn't want this to be weird.

06:32.269 --> 06:34.470
I just came here to talk about foreskin.

06:34.994 --> 06:37.034
I thought you were here to
talk about the reunion.

06:37.035 --> 06:39.765
No, no, that was just a brilliant
ploy to get in the door.

06:39.833 --> 06:40.699
Of course it was.

06:40.768 --> 06:44.736
I need you to tell my wife that it's
better for my son to be uncircumcised.

06:45.472 --> 06:46.837
You can do this, right?

06:46.906 --> 06:48.405
No, I'm not doing that.

06:48.474 --> 06:49.314
That's inappropriate.

06:49.315 --> 06:51.008
I came up with this affidavit.

06:51.076 --> 06:52.242
If you would just sign it.

06:52.311 --> 06:55.879
Okay. "I, Shiva Komedi
Somakanakram, do by so solemnly

06:55.947 --> 06:58.615
swear that Kevin McArthur
and I had great sex"...?

06:58.683 --> 07:01.517
Kevin, we were 16.

07:01.586 --> 07:03.919
It was in the back of Pete's mom's car.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.120
Can I put down "satisfied"

07:05.189 --> 07:06.355
then?

07:06.423 --> 07:08.757
It didn't even last a
whole Aerosmith song.

07:08.825 --> 07:09.925
So, "acceptable"?

07:09.993 --> 07:11.126
All right?

07:11.195 --> 07:12.360
What?! Come on.

07:12.429 --> 07:14.549
This is something that you
should be talking to your

07:14.550 --> 07:16.565
pediatrician about, maybe a psychiatrist.

07:16.633 --> 07:17.766
I don't know. Maybe both.

07:17.835 --> 07:21.770
Well, Dr. Levenson is not on my team, so...
You guys are with Levenson?

07:21.839 --> 07:22.938
Yeah.

07:23.007 --> 07:23.939
He's really cute.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.140
Cute?

07:25.209 --> 07:26.209
Yeah. You met him, right?

07:26.276 --> 07:27.409
No, I haven't met him.

07:27.478 --> 07:28.638
Well, what does he look like?

07:32.882 --> 07:34.150
So cute.

07:34.218 --> 07:36.118
Yale grad, John Hopkins Medical.

07:36.187 --> 07:37.620
Such a catch.

07:37.689 --> 07:38.821
I got... I got to go.

07:38.890 --> 07:41.825
With-with your permission, I'm
gonna forge your signature on this.

07:41.894 --> 07:42.934
Do not have my permission.

07:42.935 --> 07:45.395
Thank you!

07:45.464 --> 07:46.184
Hi, babe. Wash up.

07:46.232 --> 07:47.831
You can help me with dinner, okay?

07:47.900 --> 07:48.465
Okay.

07:48.534 --> 07:49.099
Great.

07:49.168 --> 07:50.300
Hey.

07:50.369 --> 07:51.302
Hey.

07:51.370 --> 07:52.169
How was the doctor?

07:52.238 --> 07:53.437
I heard he's good-looking.

07:53.506 --> 07:54.471
He was great.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.106
Ellie still has this rash.

07:56.175 --> 07:58.909
No, no, I said "good-looking."

07:58.978 --> 08:00.777
What? He's a great doctor.

08:00.846 --> 08:04.680
He's wonderful with Christopher, and
Ellie loves him, don't ya, babe?

08:04.749 --> 08:08.184
Yeah, I also really like the perfume
that you wear to the doctor's office.

08:08.252 --> 08:10.986
The perfume you wear
to the doctor's office!

08:11.055 --> 08:12.654
I bet you smell magnificent!

08:12.723 --> 08:14.189
Ellie, come here for a second.

08:14.258 --> 08:17.993
Show me on this doll where
the doctor touches Mommy.

08:18.062 --> 08:18.928
Be specific.

08:18.997 --> 08:19.762
Kevin, stop it!

08:19.831 --> 08:21.030
Ellie, go wash up for dinner.

08:21.099 --> 08:23.333
You are being ridiculous!

08:23.401 --> 08:24.267
Am I?

08:24.336 --> 08:26.803
Yes, Dr. Levenson is
a wonderful doctor!

08:26.872 --> 08:29.473
You know, I'm beginning to put
this whole thing together.

08:29.542 --> 08:33.277
This is all a big ploy to get circumcised.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.613
You want our son to get a Levenson.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.615
You probably wish I had a Levenson.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.951
I can't believe you've turned
this whole thing into a

08:39.952 --> 08:41.152
conversation about your penis.

08:41.220 --> 08:43.721
You know what? I just figured
you enjoyed my leading man.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.557
I do. He's more of a character
actor, but I enjoy him.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.025
Fine. You know what?

08:48.094 --> 08:49.961
Character actors work all the time.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.196
I have the Stephen Tobolowsky of dicks.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.497
And that's wonderful.

08:53.566 --> 08:56.734
But for our son, I want
him to have a Brad Pitt.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.483
Well, he's gonna get a Stephen Tobolowsky.

08:58.484 --> 08:59.671
He's gonna get Brad Pitt.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.672
Tobolowsky!

09:00.741 --> 09:02.040
Brad Pitt.

09:02.108 --> 09:05.543
Well, you know, it's time to
make a decision about this.

09:05.612 --> 09:08.312
How are we gonna do that?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.381
We're playing each other this weekend.

09:10.449 --> 09:13.884
How about we play for our son's foreskin?

09:13.953 --> 09:16.220
Bring it on.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.588
Thank you.

09:17.657 --> 09:18.890
Sutton!

09:18.958 --> 09:19.991
Hey!

09:20.060 --> 09:20.825
This is crazy!

09:20.894 --> 09:21.893
What are you doing here?

09:21.962 --> 09:24.028
This is so weird to bump
into you twice here.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.563
It's absolutely insane.

09:25.632 --> 09:28.199
Except that it's not because
I've been having all of my

09:28.268 --> 09:30.268
lunches here since I found
out you work nearby.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.036
This is seriously my third sandwich today.

09:32.105 --> 09:32.904
You are late.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.372
I know, I had a meeting.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.607
A meeting. Okay.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.876
Well, I'm glad you brought that
up because, how do you feel

09:38.937 --> 09:39.777
about night meetings?

09:39.846 --> 09:40.911
You mean, like, a date?

09:40.980 --> 09:43.214
Well, those are your words,
not mine, but, but yeah.

09:43.282 --> 09:45.750
I mean, if you were free on
Saturday night, would you be

09:45.818 --> 09:47.952
interested in having a
night meeting with me?

09:48.021 --> 09:49.187
I can't.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.756
Is it, is it too soon with Roger and...?

09:51.825 --> 09:55.893
No, no, no, no, actually I'm
going out with your friend Taco.

09:55.962 --> 09:57.228
Taco?

09:57.297 --> 10:00.398
Yeah, I bumped into him outside my
apartment, and he asked me out.

10:00.466 --> 10:02.400
What was Taco doing
outside your apartment?

10:02.468 --> 10:03.100
I don't know.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.689
He said he worked for the phone
company, but it looked like he

10:05.690 --> 10:06.737
was just taking a nap.

10:06.805 --> 10:08.965
And you're going out with
this person Saturday night?

10:08.974 --> 10:10.440
I am, yeah. It should be fun.

10:10.509 --> 10:11.469
So I'll catch you later.

10:11.510 --> 10:12.442
Okay.

10:12.511 --> 10:13.443
Bye.

10:13.512 --> 10:14.644
Bring your wallet.

10:14.713 --> 10:18.248
Hi. I'm gonna put this back.

10:20.351 --> 10:21.991
Taco, you have three girlfriends already.

10:22.054 --> 10:22.986
I need a backup.

10:23.055 --> 10:24.087
People die all the time.

10:24.156 --> 10:26.056
A month ago, I had four girlfriends.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.077
Rest in peace, Oksana.

10:27.078 --> 10:28.158
Goddamn that mountain lion.

10:28.159 --> 10:29.599
Just throw me a bone, will ya, okay?

10:29.647 --> 10:30.607
You don't need this one.

10:30.623 --> 10:32.663
Girls are like kickers, you
can never have enough.

10:32.685 --> 10:34.205
Taco, you don't need a lot of kickers!

10:34.206 --> 10:36.086
When are you gonna get
that through your head?

10:36.134 --> 10:38.067
When I drop her, you can pick her up.

10:38.136 --> 10:39.435
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

10:39.504 --> 10:42.405
As your life commissioner,
I'd love to help out.

10:42.474 --> 10:45.676
So, in this case, I think Pete
needs a lady, and Taco could

10:45.745 --> 10:46.777
use a wide receiver.

10:46.846 --> 10:49.447
So maybe there could be a trade here.

10:49.516 --> 10:50.748
Actually, not a bad idea.

10:50.817 --> 10:51.316
Go on.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.085
What do you think about Golden Tate?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.352
That's my favorite cereal.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.255
â™ª Golden Tate, put it in your... â™ª

10:56.323 --> 10:57.423
Sounds like we got a deal.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.023
Nuh.

10:58.092 --> 11:01.827
Sutton is worth a lot more
than a mediocre wide receiver.

11:01.896 --> 11:05.599
I'd say that she's worth Greg Jennings.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.507
No, okay, look, Sutton
is an attractive girl.

11:07.570 --> 11:08.802
Is she Greg Jennings hot?

11:08.871 --> 11:11.004
No, but she might be Eric Decker hot.

11:11.073 --> 11:15.208
No-no-no-no-no, tell me more
about this Greg Jennings guy.

11:15.277 --> 11:17.477
Fine, fine, Greg Jennings.

11:17.546 --> 11:22.482
As Commissioner, I sanctify this
trade and so on and so forth.

11:22.551 --> 11:26.152
All right, listen, I need your help with
my lineup, or my son Chalupa Batman is

11:26.221 --> 11:28.121
gonna get the worst buzz cut of his life.

11:28.190 --> 11:29.690
What are you talking about?

11:29.758 --> 11:32.125
I am playing Jenny this
week for my son's foreskin.

11:32.194 --> 11:34.114
Wait, so we're in the
National Foreskin League?

11:34.115 --> 11:36.275
Yeah, we're all playing to
get into the Sheatha Bowl.

11:36.298 --> 11:37.397
Are we finished now?

11:37.466 --> 11:39.626
No, I'm sorry, you're finished
because there's no way

11:39.627 --> 11:40.867
you're beating Jenny this week.

11:40.868 --> 11:44.505
The over/under on your kid's
schwanz, is that kid getting

11:44.573 --> 11:46.340
his D shorn from base to tip.

11:46.409 --> 11:48.976
Poor little Chalupa is gonna
lose his crispy outer shell.

11:49.045 --> 11:51.645
Can you not speak of my son's
member as if it was fourthmeal?

11:51.714 --> 11:53.581
I'm doing everything I can do here, guys.

11:53.650 --> 11:57.084
I even made a pilgrimage to
see Shiva, who, by the way,

11:57.153 --> 12:00.254
is not happy that her picture
is still on the trophy.

12:00.323 --> 12:00.888
Really?!

12:00.957 --> 12:02.724
Yeah, I would consider that an honor.

12:02.792 --> 12:03.925
Washington Headskins!

12:03.994 --> 12:05.059
Nice.

12:05.128 --> 12:06.261
You have to excuse Taco.

12:06.330 --> 12:08.363
He's on a five-second tape delay.

12:08.432 --> 12:11.500
Guys, I just left a killer
message for Sutton.

12:11.569 --> 12:13.729
It looks like Andre's gonna
get a little date action.

12:13.738 --> 12:14.536
I don't think so.

12:14.605 --> 12:15.604
I just traded for her.

12:15.673 --> 12:17.572
What are you talking about
you traded for her?

12:17.641 --> 12:18.573
I have priority.

12:18.642 --> 12:19.374
It's been months.

12:19.443 --> 12:20.508
Come on. It's not fair!

12:20.577 --> 12:21.577
Talk to the commissioner.

12:21.578 --> 12:23.111
Look, Andre, I approved this trade.

12:23.179 --> 12:25.946
I think you're gonna have
to take care of yourself.

12:26.015 --> 12:27.248
Stop it, all right?

12:27.316 --> 12:30.083
It's a hoodie, I do not
look like a penis, okay?

12:30.152 --> 12:34.020
Give me a break, all right, 'cause
I got into a thing this morning.

12:34.089 --> 12:36.556
Hit my head on the car and...
You should sit.

12:36.625 --> 12:37.745
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here.

12:37.793 --> 12:39.593
You have a serious head injury, yeah.

12:39.661 --> 12:40.527
Come on, man.

12:40.596 --> 12:41.562
Poor you.

12:41.630 --> 12:45.232
You should rest your arms,
take a nice deep breath.

12:45.301 --> 12:47.702
Why don't you lower your head
to your chest just a little.

12:47.770 --> 12:48.403
But your chin.

12:48.424 --> 12:49.464
It'll help your breathing.

12:49.465 --> 12:50.105
Breathing. Okay.

12:50.132 --> 12:51.052
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:51.053 --> 12:51.773
Now you know what?

12:51.841 --> 12:53.081
Straighten him up a little bit.

12:53.103 --> 12:53.823
Straighten him up.

12:53.824 --> 12:55.877
Tell you what, let's get
this a little more erect.

12:55.945 --> 12:57.111
Work the helmets.

12:57.180 --> 12:58.646
Yeah, I should rub these helmets.

12:58.715 --> 12:59.547
How are you feeling?

12:59.615 --> 13:00.495
That feels good, yeah.

13:00.496 --> 13:01.983
Andre, straighten it up a little bit.

13:02.051 --> 13:02.883
Stiffen up a little.

13:02.952 --> 13:03.752
Does that feel good?

13:03.820 --> 13:05.920
Yeah, feels really good.

13:05.988 --> 13:06.887
Feels good?

13:07.824 --> 13:08.890
Perfect.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.258
You feel all right?

13:10.327 --> 13:11.093
I feel spent.

13:11.161 --> 13:12.994
Whoo! I got to hit the sack, I think.

13:13.063 --> 13:14.930
Okay, why don't you go take a little nap?

13:14.998 --> 13:15.797
Go take a nap.

13:15.866 --> 13:16.331
All right.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.733
We'll clean up for you, bud.

13:17.801 --> 13:18.300
All right.

13:18.369 --> 13:19.009
Congratulations.

13:19.036 --> 13:21.436
Yeah. Well, well... Look at this.
Look at that.

13:21.505 --> 13:22.805
Money shot.

13:22.873 --> 13:25.240
So, Shiva, I was in the
neighborhood and thought I'd

13:25.309 --> 13:28.110
come by and talk to you a
little bit about the reunion.

13:28.178 --> 13:31.914
Save it. Kevin was in here a few
days ago with the same excuse.

13:31.982 --> 13:32.747
Why was Kevin here?

13:32.816 --> 13:35.016
He wanted me to sign some
piece of paper that said I

13:35.085 --> 13:37.586
enjoyed having sex with him
because he wasn't circumcised.

13:37.655 --> 13:38.787
What a pig!

13:38.856 --> 13:41.824
But here we are, just a
couple gals chatting away.

13:41.893 --> 13:46.129
Why don't you just, like, dish to me
about what Andre's crank is like?

13:46.198 --> 13:47.797
His what?

13:47.866 --> 13:48.999
Yeah, his little Ed Hardy.

13:49.067 --> 13:51.268
His Mr. Magoo.

13:51.337 --> 13:52.080
Why do you care?

13:52.081 --> 13:54.121
Because he won't tell me,
and I think that's rude.

13:54.142 --> 13:56.662
Well, it's his penis, and he can
do whatever he wants with it.

13:56.663 --> 13:59.063
Look, I'm not asking for his
Social Security number, I just

13:59.112 --> 14:01.612
want the 411 on his little fatty.

14:01.681 --> 14:02.980
Why would I tell you this?

14:03.049 --> 14:05.850
Because I can have that
unfortunate picture of you from

14:05.919 --> 14:08.186
high school taken off of our trophy.

14:08.255 --> 14:09.520
How?

14:09.589 --> 14:10.455
Haven't you heard?

14:10.524 --> 14:12.857
I'm the commissioner.

14:15.895 --> 14:17.662
What are you doing, Green Bay?

14:17.718 --> 14:18.798
Wrap him up and tackle him.

14:18.799 --> 14:20.799
I will take any points
from Frank Gore right now.

14:20.867 --> 14:23.107
You know what? I can't wait
to tell little baby Chalupa

14:23.108 --> 14:28.372
Batman that the very nature of his donger
was determined by a garbage time TD.

14:28.441 --> 14:29.805
How's that Shiva bowl going?

14:29.806 --> 14:32.006
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
what happened to the hoodie?

14:32.007 --> 14:33.647
Okay, I'm not wearing the hoodie anymore.

14:33.648 --> 14:34.768
Had enough about the hoodie.

14:34.837 --> 14:37.277
Changed into something where you
can't make fun of me, okay?

14:37.340 --> 14:40.775
Andre, now it kind of looks like
your head's coming out of a vagina.

14:40.843 --> 14:43.123
Actually, I see what he's
talking about because you have

14:43.124 --> 14:46.280
a labia minora, labia majora...
Yes, it's called a polo shirt

14:46.349 --> 14:47.481
and a sweater, okay?

14:47.550 --> 14:49.710
And when did you guys become
gynecologists over here?

14:49.778 --> 14:50.818
Here's all the pubic hair.

14:50.819 --> 14:51.659
You got to trim this.

14:51.687 --> 14:53.527
What's that little button
on the front there?

14:53.589 --> 14:54.621
It's a clit.

14:54.690 --> 14:55.556
It's not a clit.

14:55.625 --> 14:56.457
It's a clasp.

14:56.525 --> 14:57.565
You like to twist that up?

14:57.566 --> 14:59.193
No, no, you don't twist it, babe.

14:59.261 --> 15:01.729
What you do, you take it, you
just give it a little flip.

15:01.797 --> 15:03.397
Take it from the bean flicking master.

15:03.466 --> 15:05.106
You got to get really aggressive with it.

15:05.134 --> 15:05.774
Stop, stop that.

15:05.775 --> 15:07.935
I like to rest my helmet
right on it and just rub it.

15:07.938 --> 15:10.618
You know what, you're all perverts.
You're all, you're disgusting.

15:10.619 --> 15:11.539
You're getting all wet.

15:11.541 --> 15:12.541
I'm gonna bring you home.

15:14.244 --> 15:15.476
Half!

15:15.545 --> 15:17.011
Shiva?

15:17.080 --> 15:18.213
What do you mean, half?

15:18.281 --> 15:19.547
Andre is half circumcised.

15:19.616 --> 15:20.982
What?

15:21.051 --> 15:21.849
What?

15:21.918 --> 15:24.052
Wait, how do you have half a foreskin?

15:24.120 --> 15:25.820
Guess that would make it a two-skin?

15:25.889 --> 15:26.855
Is that even possible?

15:26.923 --> 15:27.856
It is possible.

15:27.924 --> 15:31.893
Sometimes, when attempting to
circumcise a macrosomia... What's that?

15:31.962 --> 15:33.495
It's a big, fat baby.

15:33.563 --> 15:36.264
One encounters problems removing
the entire foreskin because of

15:36.333 --> 15:37.866
the super pubic fatty tissue.

15:37.934 --> 15:39.334
Baby fupa.

15:39.402 --> 15:40.501
Baby fupa!

15:40.570 --> 15:41.610
We call it a buried penis.

15:41.637 --> 15:43.170
I'm sorry, I misspoke.

15:43.239 --> 15:44.605
A buried penis.

15:44.674 --> 15:47.175
So basically, Andre's
doctor got what he could.

15:47.244 --> 15:51.446
Just like scraping the barnacles off
a boat blindfolded in rough seas.

15:51.515 --> 15:52.547
No.

15:52.616 --> 15:54.183
Thank you.

15:54.251 --> 15:55.517
Why would you do this?

15:55.586 --> 15:56.585
I thought we were cool.

15:56.654 --> 15:57.586
We are cool.

15:57.655 --> 16:00.556
It's just that Rodney promised
that, as commissioner, he would

16:00.625 --> 16:04.293
use his powers to take my
photo off of the trophy.

16:04.362 --> 16:05.194
What?

16:05.263 --> 16:06.262
Wait, what? No.

16:06.331 --> 16:07.291
I did not agree to that.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.360
Ruxin, you can't do that.

16:08.361 --> 16:10.299
You need a league vote
for something like that.

16:10.368 --> 16:11.467
You promised.

16:11.536 --> 16:12.602
Okay, come on, guys.

16:12.671 --> 16:13.436
No!

16:13.505 --> 16:14.270
I'm sorry, no.

16:14.339 --> 16:15.104
Can't do it.

16:15.173 --> 16:16.205
Tried my hardest.

16:16.274 --> 16:19.242
Sorry, Shivs.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.471
You're gonna double-cross me?

16:20.512 --> 16:22.945
You know what? This is bullshit.

16:23.014 --> 16:24.046
Hey.

16:24.949 --> 16:27.449
This league is a pain in my ass.

16:27.518 --> 16:30.252
I didn't ask to be a part
of it, and I want out.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.286
But you're the Shiva.

16:31.355 --> 16:32.654
That's right, I am the Shiva.

16:32.723 --> 16:34.555
Totally.

16:34.624 --> 16:37.625
And the Shiva is angry.

16:37.694 --> 16:40.762
This league does not have
the Shiva's blessing.

16:40.830 --> 16:43.664
This year will go badly for everyone.

16:43.733 --> 16:46.133
The Shiva has spoken.

16:48.637 --> 16:50.438
Hate the new furniture, Andre.

16:50.507 --> 16:52.774
A little dramatic for a
urologist, don't you think?

16:52.842 --> 16:54.075
I think that was a pox.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.176
I knew she was a witch doctor.

16:56.245 --> 16:58.445
Let's just get back to the game.

16:58.514 --> 16:59.780
Yes, Frank Gore!

17:00.849 --> 17:02.849
Garbage time TD.

17:02.918 --> 17:05.585
There goes baby Chalupa's foreskin.

17:05.654 --> 17:09.856
His name is Christopher, and because I
won, Belichick is losing the hoodie.

17:09.925 --> 17:13.027
This is me, so... Cool.

17:13.095 --> 17:13.961
Yeah.

17:14.029 --> 17:17.531
Well, that was really fun, and I look
forward to future meetings, and it was...

17:17.599 --> 17:18.365
Yeah.

17:18.434 --> 17:19.199
It's really...

17:20.269 --> 17:21.300
I just missed.

17:21.369 --> 17:25.872
This is awkward, I had a really
great time tonight, but, I just...

17:25.941 --> 17:28.642
I don't think that this is gonna work.

17:28.710 --> 17:29.877
You know that already?

17:29.945 --> 17:33.314
Yeah, I'm getting older, and I
feel like a lot of guys, they

17:33.382 --> 17:35.417
have baggage, so I've just, I've had to,

17:35.418 --> 17:37.451
Implement a system.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.453
Exactly, yes.

17:38.521 --> 17:39.287
I understand.

17:39.356 --> 17:42.457
All right, I hate to
ask, but how did I do?

17:42.525 --> 17:45.493
Okay, full head of hair, plus one.

17:45.562 --> 17:46.494
Confident, plus one.

17:46.562 --> 17:50.064
I like that you stalked me in the
food court for a while, plus one.

17:50.133 --> 17:50.898
This is good.

17:50.967 --> 17:51.732
You're thorough.

17:51.801 --> 17:53.901
But there's the immaturity, minus one.

17:53.970 --> 17:55.170
Fear of commitment, minus one.

17:55.171 --> 17:55.836
That's right.

17:55.905 --> 17:57.638
You had three drinks, minus one.

17:57.707 --> 17:58.472
You had four.

17:58.541 --> 18:00.508
You were in the bathroom
so long, minus one.

18:00.576 --> 18:03.144
Wait, wait, wait, there was a
line there; we discussed this.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.178
I stand by that.

18:04.247 --> 18:05.413
For the men's room? Come on.

18:05.482 --> 18:07.482
Bragging about how much
sleep you get, minus one.

18:07.484 --> 18:08.316
It's a nice quality.

18:08.385 --> 18:10.745
And you didn't have to tell me
what celebrity every single

18:10.746 --> 18:12.521
person in the restaurant looked like.

18:12.589 --> 18:14.869
I'm still convinced that guy
might have been Tony Danza.

18:14.870 --> 18:17.255
Minus one, and I'm not even
gonna get into the whole thing

18:17.256 --> 18:19.696
about how you're still friends
with my ex-boyfriend, and I'm

18:19.764 --> 18:21.765
sure you've talked about
what I'm like in bed.

18:21.833 --> 18:24.267
Sutton, I would never do...
All right, minus one.

18:24.336 --> 18:25.769
So that's minus seven.

18:26.939 --> 18:27.871
That's rough.

18:27.940 --> 18:28.905
Sorry, Pete.

18:28.974 --> 18:30.073
Good night.

18:30.142 --> 18:31.174
Well played, Sutton.

18:31.243 --> 18:32.208
You're out of my league.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.243
Hey, Pete.

18:33.311 --> 18:34.944
Taco, what the hell are you doing here?

18:35.013 --> 18:36.879
I'm gonna hang out with Sutton.

18:36.948 --> 18:38.614
Yeah, but... No, no, I know.

18:38.683 --> 18:39.448
I know the deal.

18:39.517 --> 18:40.383
No dating, just sex.

18:40.451 --> 18:44.253
Yeah, but... Independently
wealthy, plus eight.

18:47.096 --> 18:49.899
All right, Christopher, are you
ready for your first haircut?

18:49.967 --> 18:52.111
I'm not comfortable with this at all.

18:52.112 --> 18:53.272
It doesn't look very sterile.

18:53.273 --> 18:54.873
I saw some kid picking his nose outside.

18:54.942 --> 18:56.022
Have you met your daughter?

18:56.091 --> 18:57.251
What's that supposed to mean?

18:58.008 --> 18:58.473
Hey, hey!

18:58.542 --> 18:59.609
It's the MacArthur clan.

18:59.729 --> 19:00.703
How are you?

19:00.823 --> 19:02.044
Jenny, good to see you.

19:02.113 --> 19:03.461
Hi, hey.

19:03.581 --> 19:05.376
Mr. MacArthur, finally, we meet.

19:05.496 --> 19:06.047
Yes.

19:06.116 --> 19:06.882
You're a lucky man.

19:06.950 --> 19:07.790
Let me tell you this.

19:07.859 --> 19:09.859
Your wife does not look
like she just had a baby.

19:09.860 --> 19:12.142
Well, she had a baby,
'cause I put it inside her.

19:12.262 --> 19:12.755
Kevin.

19:12.823 --> 19:13.656
With my penis.

19:13.724 --> 19:14.556
Kevin.

19:14.625 --> 19:16.487
Okay, good.

19:16.607 --> 19:18.167
Hey, Ellie, how you doing there, kiddo?

19:18.168 --> 19:19.137
How's you rash going?

19:19.257 --> 19:20.430
What's going on here?

19:20.550 --> 19:21.190
There's no rash.

19:21.310 --> 19:22.150
What about your neck?

19:22.151 --> 19:22.872
It disappeared.

19:22.992 --> 19:24.128
How did it disappear?

19:24.248 --> 19:24.857
I don't know.

19:24.977 --> 19:26.402
Just one of those things, I guess.

19:26.522 --> 19:28.132
Top of his class,

19:28.252 --> 19:29.289
Okay, we're good to go.

19:29.409 --> 19:31.988
I've done thousands of these, so
please, you're in safe hands.

19:32.108 --> 19:33.928
I don't want you to worry about a thing.

19:34.048 --> 19:34.661
Easy does it.

19:34.781 --> 19:36.101
All right, this isn't a Benihana.

19:36.102 --> 19:38.315
You're not gonna pop his
foreskin into a shirt pocket.

19:38.435 --> 19:39.148
No.

19:39.217 --> 19:41.678
Okay, you guys have any last
questions before we go ahead?

19:41.798 --> 19:42.862
I'm good, I'm ready.

19:42.982 --> 19:47.881
I can't... We can't watch this.

19:48.001 --> 19:49.288
I... we should wait outside.

19:49.408 --> 19:53.218
Why do they do this to poor little
babies like baby Christopher?

19:53.338 --> 19:55.258
'Cause Daddy doesn't know
how to set a line up.

19:55.259 --> 19:55.632
Let's go.

19:57.192 --> 19:58.055
You ready?

19:58.175 --> 19:59.186
Yes, ready.

19:59.306 --> 20:00.269
Great.

20:02.768 --> 20:05.675
So there's convertibles and
then there are hardtops.

20:05.795 --> 20:10.370
Some people like the convertibles, but
trust me, hard tops are much better.

20:10.490 --> 20:11.584
It's a classic look.

20:12.191 --> 20:15.541
Did Mommy bring her special
perfume to the doctor's office again?

20:15.661 --> 20:18.180
No, she didn't want to wear it, but I did.

20:18.404 --> 20:19.673
Is it itching?

20:20.108 --> 20:21.190
Yeah.

20:21.662 --> 20:23.988
It's the perfume that's making you itch.

20:24.108 --> 20:25.157
I'm a genius.

20:25.277 --> 20:26.277
Okay, I'll be right back.

20:26.278 --> 20:27.229
I gotta go.

20:27.298 --> 20:29.665
Okay, I think we're all set to go.

20:29.785 --> 20:30.423
Let's do this.

20:30.543 --> 20:31.627
He's so brave.

20:32.037 --> 20:32.725
Boo!

20:32.845 --> 20:33.285
Geez.

20:33.405 --> 20:35.848
It was the perfume, bitches.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.776
And you call yourself a doctor?

20:38.965 --> 20:39.616
Oops.

20:39.736 --> 20:40.238
Oops?

20:40.358 --> 20:40.872
Oops?

20:40.992 --> 20:43.479
Oops, like that's the best job
you've ever done, oops, right?

20:43.548 --> 20:46.084
Please tell me you did
not just make a mistake.

20:46.204 --> 20:46.932
Well...

20:47.370 --> 20:49.176
Half a one.

20:49.466 --> 20:57.466
