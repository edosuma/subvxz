18:17.638 --> 18:22.177
And when you're back,
it'll be worse.

19:09.773 --> 19:12.856
(Negan whistling)

19:19.700 --> 19:20.940
(chuckles)

19:21.118 --> 19:23.951
(sighs)

19:24.121 --> 19:26.533
Are we pissing our pants yet?

19:40.804 --> 19:42.419
Who are you?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.304
Negan.

19:46.476 --> 19:49.309
Who are you?

19:49.479 --> 19:51.390
Negan.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.356
Who are you?

19:54.526 --> 19:57.268
All: Negan.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.437
(Negan chuckles)
You see that?

19:59.615 --> 20:02.027
I am everywhere.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.776
And this was your shot
to prove to me that

20:05.954 --> 20:08.331
that fundamental fact
was sinking in,

20:08.498 --> 20:09.783
and you failed.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.459
Which sucks,

20:11.627 --> 20:15.165
because your life
was about to get so much cooler.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.294
Am I right?

20:20.469 --> 20:21.584
Damn right.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.968
(chuckles)

20:33.982 --> 20:36.644
Now, Dwight gave you
some options.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.558
I don't think
you get it yet.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.274
So I'm gonna break it down
for you.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.949
You get three choices.

20:43.116 --> 20:46.108
One,
you wind up on the spike

20:46.286 --> 20:48.777
and you work for me
as a dead man.

20:48.956 --> 20:52.494
Two, you get out of your cell,
you work for points,

20:52.668 --> 20:55.125
but you're gonna wish
you were dead.

20:55.295 --> 20:58.708
Or, three,
you work for me,

20:58.882 --> 21:01.419
you get yourself
a brand-new pair of shoes,

21:01.593 --> 21:03.925
and you live like a king!

21:05.013 --> 21:08.301
Choice seems
pretty obvious.

21:08.475 --> 21:13.139
You should know,
there is no door number four.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.304
This is it.

21:15.482 --> 21:19.441
This is
the only way.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.564
(chuckles)

21:25.742 --> 21:28.074
Screw it.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.415
Wow!

21:36.795 --> 21:40.333
You don't scare easy.

21:40.507 --> 21:41.917
I love that.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.631
But, Lucille...

21:48.598 --> 21:50.429
well, it kind of pisses her off.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.843
She finds it
to be disrespectful.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.558
Lucky for you,

21:56.732 --> 22:00.645
she's not feeling
too thirsty today.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.731
But I am.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.570
So...

22:09.745 --> 22:12.236
I'm gonna go
get me a drink!

22:12.414 --> 22:14.279
(chuckles)

22:18.754 --> 22:21.541
(whistling)

22:26.053 --> 22:29.295
(walker growling)

22:52.329 --> 22:54.911
(walker growling)

23:06.551 --> 23:08.416
(growling)

23:08.595 --> 23:11.007
(grunting)

23:29.533 --> 23:30.898
Sherry: Daryl?

23:38.500 --> 23:42.243
There's so many things
I wish I never found out.

23:44.172 --> 23:47.164
| wish
I didn't try...

23:53.265 --> 23:56.302
Back in the woods...

23:56.476 --> 23:59.843
after I lost Tina...

24:01.940 --> 24:05.808
when we took your stuff,
when we decided to go back...

24:07.237 --> 24:10.149
I told you
I was sorry.

24:11.658 --> 24:15.071
And you said,
"You're gonna be."

24:19.166 --> 24:20.906
lam.

24:22.377 --> 24:25.119
(footsteps departing)

24:32.304 --> 24:33.510
I'm screwed up.

24:33.680 --> 24:34.886
My bike's screwed up,

24:35.056 --> 24:36.512
and you're going back
because you owe.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.924
And now you owe
a hell of a lot more.

24:39.102 --> 24:41.684
Was it worth it?

24:43.023 --> 24:44.763
Just let me go.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.022
I can't.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.858
Why?

24:52.949 --> 24:54.359
Shut up.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.407
We used to be friendly.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.450
Shut up.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.371
After everything
he did...

25:08.548 --> 25:11.585
to you,
to your wife...

25:11.760 --> 25:13.796
Don't talk about her.

25:13.970 --> 25:15.050
She's not my wife.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.553
Not anymore.

25:19.142 --> 25:21.929
Look, there's nowhere to go.

25:22.103 --> 25:25.937
Everything's his or will be.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.392
I know.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.648
Keep walking.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.316
I said keep walking!

25:37.494 --> 25:38.825
It's okay.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.328
What?

25:42.499 --> 25:44.706
It's okay
if you do it.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.787
I get it.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.793
Hell, I want you to.
Please.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.955
Shut up.

25:51.132 --> 25:52.963
Keep walking.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.294
I can't go back.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.300
You will.

25:56.471 --> 25:57.460
'Cause that's the only way.

25:57.639 --> 25:59.300
See, that's what
he tells us.

25:59.474 --> 26:02.466
That there's no choice,
no way but his way.

26:02.644 --> 26:05.602
Thug swoops in
with a baseball bat and a smile,

26:05.772 --> 26:10.015
and we're all so scared
that we gave up everything.

26:10.193 --> 26:11.979
Well, there's only one of him
and all of us,

26:12.153 --> 26:13.279
so why are we
living like this?

26:13.446 --> 26:16.313
Because look
where we are!

26:18.535 --> 26:19.650
Now we're not.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.443
(scoffs)

26:21.621 --> 26:24.328
You know...

26:24.499 --> 26:30.119
after me and Maria survived
those first few months...

26:30.297 --> 26:33.414
when we got there...

26:33.592 --> 26:36.299
we thought
it would be okay.

26:38.305 --> 26:41.217
We thought we knew
how to fight the monsters.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.524
Get up.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.359
It's okay, D.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.648
Get up!

26:59.826 --> 27:02.033
There's nothing
back there for me.

27:03.788 --> 27:07.030
This is the last time
I'm going to kneel.

27:07.208 --> 27:08.197
Get up!

27:08.376 --> 27:10.367
- You feel.
- Get up...

27:10.545 --> 27:12.046
I remember, D.

27:12.213 --> 27:15.046
...or I'll put every person
you ever talked to on the fence.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.003
|'|| blindfold them,

27:18.178 --> 27:19.543
and I'll make them
eat shit sandwiches

27:19.721 --> 27:22.463
for the rest of their short,
sorry lives.

27:24.225 --> 27:28.138
l'll dig up your dead wife
and feed her body to the crows.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.555
You feel that?
You feel it?!

27:31.733 --> 27:33.564
Okay, D.

27:37.113 --> 27:38.694
You won.

27:48.541 --> 27:50.918
But you know
there's nothing left.

28:29.416 --> 28:32.123
(gunshot, body thuds)

28:39.175 --> 28:43.760
(door opens, closes)

29:04.117 --> 29:05.823
Can I have one?

29:14.502 --> 29:15.708
(lighter clicks)

29:19.674 --> 29:22.006
(sighs)

29:31.019 --> 29:33.681
He good to you?

29:33.855 --> 29:35.265
Yeah.

29:38.318 --> 29:40.024
Good.

29:41.696 --> 29:43.527
- Are you, um...
- (clears throat)

29:43.698 --> 29:45.939
You happy?

29:48.369 --> 29:50.155
Yeah.

29:52.081 --> 29:53.412
That's good.

29:57.045 --> 29:59.081
I did the right thing.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.464
It's a hell of a lot better
than being dead.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.673
Yeah.

30:26.783 --> 30:30.071
(upbeat music playing)

30:44.759 --> 30:46.920
J‘ Let's have a moment
in the sun... .l‘

30:47.095 --> 30:49.086
(music shuts off)

30:49.264 --> 30:52.131
(lock clicks, door opens)

31:03.111 --> 31:04.772
Eat.

31:09.784 --> 31:12.241
You got your friend killed.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.994
I got Tina killed.

31:15.164 --> 31:18.156
And don't pretend
like you don't know the score.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.668
You should be dead.

31:29.846 --> 31:33.430
But Negan's taken a shine to you.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.136
You're lucky.

31:35.310 --> 31:38.393
Don't forget.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.358
Bon appetit.

31:45.528 --> 31:49.646
(door closes, lock clicks)

32:46.422 --> 32:49.038
J‘ l was all right .l‘

32:49.217 --> 32:51.503
J‘ For a while J‘

32:51.678 --> 32:56.263
J‘ I could smile for a while J‘

32:56.432 --> 32:58.514
J‘ But I saw you last night J‘

32:58.685 --> 33:01.267
J‘ You held my hand so tight J‘

33:01.437 --> 33:06.056
J‘ As you stopped to say hello J‘

33:06.234 --> 33:08.896
J‘ Oh, you wished me well J‘

33:09.070 --> 33:12.278
J‘ You couldn't tell J‘

33:12.448 --> 33:16.316
J‘ That I'd been crying J‘

33:16.494 --> 33:18.906
J‘ Over you J‘

33:19.080 --> 33:23.744
J‘ Crying over you J“

33:23.918 --> 33:28.287
J‘ When you said, "So long" J“

33:28.464 --> 33:32.753
J‘ Left me standing all alone J‘

33:32.927 --> 33:35.088
J‘ Alone and crying... J‘

33:35.263 --> 33:36.378
(crying)

33:36.556 --> 33:38.547
.l‘ Crying J‘

33:38.725 --> 33:40.932
.l‘ Crying J‘

33:41.102 --> 33:42.558
.l‘ Crying J‘

33:42.729 --> 33:47.268
J‘ It's hard to understand J“

33:47.442 --> 33:52.106
J‘ But the touch of your hand J‘

33:52.280 --> 33:55.272
J‘ Can start me crying J‘

33:57.285 --> 33:59.571
.l‘ I thought that I J‘

33:59.746 --> 34:02.328
J‘ Was over you J‘

34:02.498 --> 34:06.332
J‘ But it's true, so true... J‘

34:06.502 --> 34:09.665
(lock clicks, door opens)

34:23.728 --> 34:25.468
Dwight:
Step in.

34:26.814 --> 34:28.805
(chuckles)

34:28.983 --> 34:30.598
Ahh.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.859
Jesus.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.320
You...

34:36.491 --> 34:39.233
look awful.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.366
Don't you worry.

34:41.537 --> 34:43.368
We'll have Carson
fix you all up.

34:43.539 --> 34:46.497
You thirsty?
Here.

34:46.667 --> 34:49.158
Ah, hell, I forgot.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.248
Your mouth is all...

34:51.422 --> 34:55.006
puffed up
like a baboon's ass.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.882
Need a straw?

34:57.053 --> 34:59.510
D, give him a straw.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.887
What's wrong
with you?

35:04.852 --> 35:06.183
See that guy?

35:06.354 --> 35:07.343
He hustles.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.262
I like hustle.

35:10.691 --> 35:13.273
But believe it or not,

35:13.444 --> 35:16.277
things weren't always cool
between us.

35:18.991 --> 35:22.404
See, D here,
he worked for points,

35:22.578 --> 35:28.118
him and his super hot wife
and her super hot sister.

35:29.168 --> 35:32.035
But, see, sis,
she needed meds.

35:32.213 --> 35:35.205
And that shit is hard
to scavenge,

35:35.383 --> 35:36.748
so it cost more.

35:36.926 --> 35:39.212
Sis fell behind
on points,

35:39.387 --> 35:41.878
so I asked her
to marry me.

35:42.056 --> 35:44.468
Told her
I would take care of her

35:44.642 --> 35:46.052
in sickness
and in health,

35:46.227 --> 35:50.061
blah, blah, blah,
because lam a stand-up guy.

35:52.608 --> 35:55.725
She tells me
that she's gonna think about it.

35:55.903 --> 35:57.518
Next thing you know,

35:57.697 --> 36:00.734
I'm dealing with
an orange situation.

36:00.908 --> 36:04.275
Dwighty boy here
stole all the medication

36:04.453 --> 36:06.830
and took off
with his super hot wife

36:06.998 --> 36:10.331
and my super hot
maybe soon-to-be fiancée.

36:10.501 --> 36:12.241
(Lucille taps)

36:15.590 --> 36:18.081
So I had to send my guys
after him.

36:18.259 --> 36:22.753
Because I can't let
something like that stand.

36:22.930 --> 36:27.299
There... are... rules.

36:28.644 --> 36:31.681
Cost me an arm and a leg
going after him.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.723
And you know what,
Dwighty boy?

36:36.152 --> 36:37.892
(chuckles)

36:38.070 --> 36:39.935
He still got away.

36:40.114 --> 36:42.105
But here's the thing.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.569
D, he saw the light.

36:44.744 --> 36:45.950
He manned up.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.280
He came back.

36:47.455 --> 36:49.946
He asked for my forgiveness.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.615
I like that.

36:52.793 --> 36:55.409
Made me...
take notice.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.923
But Lucille...

37:01.093 --> 37:05.086
well, you know how she is.

37:05.264 --> 37:09.803
She is a stickler
for the rules.

37:09.977 --> 37:12.059
So, Dwight...

37:17.818 --> 37:19.149
which lthought
was kind of cute,

37:19.320 --> 37:22.403
so I wasjust
gonna kill him.

37:23.532 --> 37:26.490
But then Sherry says
that she will marry me

37:26.661 --> 37:28.572
ifl let Dwight live,

37:28.746 --> 37:31.488
which, if you think about it,
that's a pretty screwed-up deal,

37:31.666 --> 37:32.872
'cause I was gonna marry her sister

37:33.042 --> 37:35.875
until she wound up dead, but...

37:36.045 --> 37:39.378
Sherry is super hot.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.509
Anyways,
it was a start.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.886
But it wasn't enough.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.260
So Dwight...

37:51.310 --> 37:53.175
he got the iron.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.595
And then I married
his super hot wife.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.516
Ex-wife.

37:59.694 --> 38:05.530
And then after all that,
he still got on board.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.985
And now
look at him.

38:07.159 --> 38:08.239
Pow!

38:08.411 --> 38:11.369
One of my top guys.

38:11.539 --> 38:15.031
And we are totally cool.

38:15.209 --> 38:16.198
The point being,

38:16.377 --> 38:20.165
I think you can be that guy.

38:21.465 --> 38:25.208
I think you are ready to be that guy.

38:25.386 --> 38:26.375
You look around here.

38:26.554 --> 38:29.011
This?

38:29.181 --> 38:33.390
Well, it can all be yours.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.516
All you got to do

38:37.690 --> 38:41.729
is answer one simple question.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.568
Who are you?

38:49.702 --> 38:50.817
(Negan chuckles)

38:50.995 --> 38:52.576
What, does the cat
got your tongue?

38:52.747 --> 38:55.113
You're just overwhelmed
by the awesomeness of this?

38:57.460 --> 39:00.372
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

39:12.391 --> 39:14.177
Who are you?

39:34.955 --> 39:36.286
Daryl.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.072
- Oh.
- This is the only--

39:38.250 --> 39:40.241
Hey.
Sst, sst, sst.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.801
It's cool, D.

39:51.722 --> 39:54.429
He made his choice.

39:55.518 --> 39:59.227
Ain't my problem
if he made a dumbass choice.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.901
(grunts)

40:09.824 --> 40:11.655
You're gonna wind up
in that room

40:11.826 --> 40:14.112
or hanging
on the fence!

40:20.418 --> 40:22.329
Daryl:
I get why you did it.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.787
Why you took it.

40:29.969 --> 40:32.130
You were thinking
about someone else.

40:38.352 --> 40:40.343
That's why I can't.

40:48.487 --> 40:51.820
(walkers growling)

41:09.550 --> 41:11.256
(bottle shatters)

41:45.503 --> 41:48.836
(sighs)

41:59.934 --> 42:02.892
(music playing)
