03:06.448 --> 03:07.896
Honestly, at this point
in my life

03:07.965 --> 03:09.482
I don't think I've ever
experienced real love.

03:09.551 --> 03:12.241
I've never had, like,
actual unconditional love

03:12.310 --> 03:13.655
where they're gonna love you,
like, no matter

03:13.724 --> 03:16.172
if you up or ,like,
you make a mistake,

03:16.241 --> 03:17.620
they're still gonna stand
by you and love you,

03:17.689 --> 03:19.000
'cause, like,
that's what love is.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.275
Like, no matter how many times
you up,

03:20.344 --> 03:21.896
they're gonna stand

03:21.965 --> 03:23.482
- I felt like that too, Gus.

03:23.551 --> 03:27.517
I felt like, you know, Dillon,
like, my first relationship

03:27.586 --> 03:29.758
was so bad.
He was so mean to me.

03:29.827 --> 03:32.344
That's, like, why it didn't
take me long at all to get,

03:32.413 --> 03:35.000
like, get over him.
But with Dillon, I'm,

03:35.068 --> 03:37.172
like, struggling so bad,
because I'm like,

03:37.241 --> 03:40.137
"You know, even though
he has a bad problem,

03:40.206 --> 03:41.896
when he is sober,
he is such a great guy."

03:41.965 --> 03:44.758
- He's such a good guy.
- So I think that I struggle

03:44.827 --> 03:46.206
with that in the same sense.

03:46.275 --> 03:50.137
I'm like, "Do I know
what real love is?"

03:50.206 --> 03:52.448
Because someone
that really loves me

03:52.517 --> 03:54.068
wouldn't choose drugs
over me, right?

03:54.137 --> 03:55.379
- No. And wouldn't lie neither.

03:55.448 --> 03:57.655
That's, like, a thing
I struggle with too.

03:57.724 --> 03:58.896
Like, I feel like me

03:58.965 --> 04:00.379
and you both have really
bad trust issues

04:00.448 --> 04:01.965

like that. And so once--

04:02.034 --> 04:03.586
- We do.
- Yeah. So like, when somebody,

04:03.655 --> 04:05.034
like, lies to you,
it's a [bleep],

04:05.103 --> 04:06.482
like, dig to the heart
'cause it's like,

04:06.551 --> 04:07.965
"I care about"--
Like, if I care about you,

04:08.034 --> 04:10.000
I'm not gonna
lie to you. Like, I'm gonna--

04:10.068 --> 04:12.103

are so much alike,

04:12.172 --> 04:14.517

18:21.724 --> 18:23.137
- Okay. Oh!

18:23.206 --> 18:24.137
God damn it. I fell.

18:24.206 --> 18:27.241
- You're fine.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.586
- Hey, come on, buddy.
Come on.

18:29.655 --> 18:32.482
<i>I'm trying to get in the pen
and act like a goat.</i>

18:32.551 --> 18:36.793
Bah-ha-ha.
Bah-ha-ha-ha.

18:36.862 --> 18:38.620
Salutations, goat.

18:38.689 --> 18:40.068
- What does that even mean?

18:40.137 --> 18:41.620
- That [bleep]'s
got crazy eyes.

18:41.689 --> 18:44.103
One of these goats out here,
it has this,

18:44.172 --> 18:45.758
<i>like, all black,
and it's got</i>

18:45.827 --> 18:47.413
<i>the most piercing blue eyes</i>

18:47.482 --> 18:48.793
<i>that I've ever seen
in my life.</i>

18:50.172 --> 18:51.344
<i>Looks into your soul.</i>

18:51.413 --> 18:53.206
freaks me the out.

18:53.275 --> 18:54.793
I'm damn sure
not gonna kiss it.

18:54.862 --> 18:56.551
Look. You want to fetch?

18:56.620 --> 18:57.965
Look at this.
See it? Go get it.

18:58.034 --> 19:01.517
- Codi, it's not a dog.
- Go get it. Go get it.

19:03.758 --> 19:05.724
- There's something wrong
with these

19:07.620 --> 19:09.034
There's something
wrong with it.

19:09.103 --> 19:10.620
- Patricia and Horny Goat,
we're leaving,

19:10.689 --> 19:11.586
'cause you made us
feel not welcome.

19:11.655 --> 19:12.586
- Yeah.

19:14.448 --> 19:15.586
<i>- ♪ Do your thang,
do your thang ♪</i>

19:15.655 --> 19:17.241
<i>♪ Do your thang ♪</i>

19:17.310 --> 19:18.724

19:18.793 --> 19:21.034
<i>♪ It don't matter,

19:21.103 --> 19:25.241
- You don't know
what you're doing. Go outside.

19:25.310 --> 19:27.344
- What are you talking about?
- Go outside.

19:27.413 --> 19:28.724
No, you don't know
what you're doing.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.689
Stop.
Are you serious?

19:30.758 --> 19:32.172
I made that for all of us!

19:32.241 --> 19:35.482
Are you serious, Codi?

19:35.551 --> 19:37.758
- I was just nibbling.
- I just worked hard on those.

19:37.827 --> 19:39.482
You just ate a whole brownie.

19:39.551 --> 19:40.862
- I ate half of one.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.620
- Are you trying to
piss me off on purpose?

19:42.689 --> 19:43.862
- No. I--I had to try--

19:43.931 --> 19:45.517
- Do you really not give
a [bleep]?

19:45.586 --> 19:46.689
Go the outside.

19:46.758 --> 19:47.620
- I just saw a brownie
over there,

19:47.689 --> 19:49.827
and I wanted to have a bite.

19:49.896 --> 19:52.206
- Pissing me off. You just ate
a whole brownie.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.965
- Candace is getting mad at me
for eating her food.

19:55.034 --> 19:56.344
I'll set it right there.

19:56.413 --> 19:59.620
The food she cooked
for us to eat.

19:59.689 --> 20:02.620
- I ate half a brownie.
- I made enough for us.

20:02.689 --> 20:05.551
- I put half of it back.

20:05.620 --> 20:06.793
- Dinner time, baby.
Let's get it.

20:06.862 --> 20:08.862
- Ooh.

20:08.931 --> 20:10.172
Here I come.

20:11.551 --> 20:13.310
- Is he peeing?

20:13.379 --> 20:16.000
- No. Yep. I think he just did.

20:16.068 --> 20:18.344
- I mean, this place
is literally a pigsty.

20:18.413 --> 20:20.965
Like, it's an actual
pig sty now.

20:21.034 --> 20:22.724
- Thank you, Candace.

20:22.793 --> 20:25.068
- Lord God, I'm gonna ask
that you bless this food,

20:25.137 --> 20:26.758
that this food be nourishment
to our bodies.

20:26.827 --> 20:28.689
Lord God, good food,

20:28.758 --> 20:31.344
Good meat, good God, let's eat.

20:31.413 --> 20:33.068
- Amen.

20:33.137 --> 20:34.689
- I put a little
Cajun seasoning

20:34.758 --> 20:36.689
in the mac and cheese.
- It's good.

20:36.758 --> 20:38.275
- And I love it.

20:38.344 --> 20:40.517
- Nilsa, are you getting
excited to be a mommy?

20:40.586 --> 20:42.724
- I'm ready for him to be here.

20:42.793 --> 20:45.689
- So what was the whole
getting down on one knee

20:45.758 --> 20:47.965
proposal setup like?
What did he do?

20:48.034 --> 20:51.827
- We were at his papa's house,
and I had forgot my face wash.

20:51.896 --> 20:54.000
But he uses, like,
a similar-type face wash

20:54.068 --> 20:56.931
to me or whatever.
So I'm looking in his backpack,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.517
<i>and there's a little ring box
in his backpack,</i>

21:00.586 --> 21:03.172
<i>and I'm like,
"Oh, what is that?"</i>

21:03.241 --> 21:04.482
I want to look,
but I don't want to look,

21:04.551 --> 21:06.172
'cause I don't want to
ruin the surprise.

21:06.241 --> 21:08.517
And so I called Aimee,
and Aimee's like,

21:08.586 --> 21:11.758
"Don't you dare look in
that bag. Don't you dare look."

21:11.827 --> 21:13.827
She's like, "You are gonna
ruin the surprise."

21:13.896 --> 21:15.655
- Aimee would look though.
- Sure would have.

21:15.724 --> 21:17.758
- So then--the night
of my birthday,

21:17.827 --> 21:19.310
<i>he gets down on one knee,</i>

21:19.379 --> 21:22.172
and it was like my whole future
flashed before my eyes,

21:22.241 --> 21:26.655
like seeing Grey run in the
yard, us growing old together.

21:26.724 --> 21:29.724
And I was like, "Oh, my God.
It's really happening,"

21:29.793 --> 21:33.103
and then I saw the ring,
and I was like, "Oh, my God."

21:33.172 --> 21:34.551
I was like, "yeah."

21:34.620 --> 21:36.965
<i>- I'm so happy that Nilsa's
getting married.</i>

21:37.034 --> 21:39.103
She deserves all the happiness
in the world.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.551
<i>But it does make me think
about</i>

21:41.620 --> 21:43.000
my relationship with Dillon.

21:43.068 --> 21:44.620
<i>And it's sad.</i>

21:44.689 --> 21:45.896
- So then I was like,
"Yes, of course,"

21:45.965 --> 21:47.103
and I started, like,
tearing up,

21:47.172 --> 21:48.758
and I was like,
"Oh, my God."

21:48.827 --> 21:50.034
- You know, honestly I never

21:50.103 --> 21:51.551
thought Nilsa
was gonna be the first one

21:51.620 --> 21:54.344
to have a baby and settle down
and get engaged.

21:54.413 --> 21:57.241
- We're engaged.

21:57.310 --> 21:59.379
<i>- But hell,
if Nilsa can do it,</i>

21:59.448 --> 22:02.758
<i>it's almost like there's
a chance for all of us.</i>

22:02.827 --> 22:04.655
- Can I have another one?
- Yeah.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.689
<i>- It's just a matter
of growing up.</i>

22:06.758 --> 22:09.275
Aimee, do you want
some more macaroni and cheese?

22:09.344 --> 22:12.103
<i>On the other hand, maybe
some of us are not ready.</i>

22:12.172 --> 22:15.103
- Oh, man.
-

22:15.172 --> 22:16.137
- No, no!

22:16.206 --> 22:17.448
- Stop!

22:17.517 --> 22:19.068
- I'm not cleaning
any of this up.

22:19.137 --> 22:20.827
<i>- No, not the salad!</i>

22:37.482 --> 22:39.275
- No, no!
- Oh, I'm out of here.

22:39.344 --> 22:41.000
I'm not cleaning

22:41.068 --> 22:42.758
- Stop. Stop.
Nah, I'm not doing this.

22:42.827 --> 22:45.586
- Oh, [bleep]!

22:45.655 --> 22:47.172
<i>- It's our first

22:47.241 --> 22:48.413

22:48.482 --> 22:50.275
<i>I wasn't even done eating,</i>

22:50.344 --> 22:52.206
and we're gonna start
throwing food at each other?

22:52.275 --> 22:54.931
- Not the salad.
- Oh, hell no.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.172
- Not the salad.
I wanted the salad. Stop!

22:58.241 --> 22:59.793

- We are.

22:59.862 --> 23:02.137

23:02.206 --> 23:03.275

23:03.344 --> 23:04.206
- Didn't you throw
some food too?

23:04.275 --> 23:05.482
- I threw one thing.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.620
- Okay, well, then you'll
pick one thing up.

23:06.689 --> 23:08.068
- All right.
- one thing?

23:08.137 --> 23:09.586
My ass
- I picked it up.

23:09.655 --> 23:12.241
- Now this is starting to look
like a Floribama house.

23:12.310 --> 23:14.034
<i>You know,
there's food everywhere.</i>

23:14.103 --> 23:15.620
<i>There's
all over the walls.</i>

23:15.689 --> 23:17.517
<i>I mean, there's a whole salad
in the corner.</i>

23:17.586 --> 23:21.517
I mean, now this is like
a Floribama house, all right?

23:21.586 --> 23:22.827
- Ow.
- Sorry.

23:22.896 --> 23:25.586
- My God. Aimee, you got
this all in your hair.

23:25.655 --> 23:27.068
I don't know what to do, bitch.

23:27.137 --> 23:28.655
- What the
are you doing?

23:28.724 --> 23:30.896
- Look at how bad her hair is.

23:30.965 --> 23:33.068
- I'm gonna have to shave
my head bald.

- Help me.

23:43.689 --> 23:46.000

on the mac and cheese.

You did that--hey,

tumble out everywhere.

What did I do?
Candace.

24:37.862 --> 24:40.172
Candace, you got it on me?
I didn't do nothing.

24:40.241 --> 24:43.275
- It was 100%
a complete accident.

- Ahh...

24:45.137 --> 24:49.103

those brownies.

I'll get you one.

25:03.206 --> 25:05.000

25:05.068 --> 25:08.137
the biggest
farm animal in the house.

25:08.206 --> 25:10.379
- I got you a brownie.
It's my heart.

25:10.448 --> 25:11.931
- Codi swears
it was an accident.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
"I didn't do this.
I accidentally hit you.

25:14.068 --> 25:15.413
This. That."

25:15.482 --> 25:18.827
It's like, "Codi, we know
you're a capper, bruh."

25:18.896 --> 25:21.344
Hey, Codi, you're funny because
you're our "Sir Cap-a-lot."

25:21.413 --> 25:26.241
- Yeah, of course I am.
Sir Caps-a-Lot.

25:26.310 --> 25:27.758
- No way. Oh!

great to you.

25:41.172 --> 25:42.344

25:42.413 --> 25:44.206
- Hey, this is your chance
to kiss her.

25:44.275 --> 25:45.448
- I'm just playing.
- I know.

25:45.517 --> 25:47.758
- Kiss her. Make out. Make out.
Make out.

25:47.827 --> 25:49.034
- [bleep]'s in my eye for real.
My eye is burning.

25:49.103 --> 25:50.965
- Come here.
Let's put some water on it.

25:51.034 --> 25:52.000
Come here.
Let's put some water on it.

25:52.068 --> 25:53.413
Let's put some--ah!

25:53.482 --> 25:57.275
- Ahh!

25:57.344 --> 26:00.551
- So, Codi, after you done been
picking at me all day,

26:00.620 --> 26:03.724
you ruin my brownies.
You ruin dinner.

26:03.793 --> 26:07.275
Then you want to try to go in
and snatch a kiss?

26:07.344 --> 26:09.344
Codi, you nasty. You nasty.

26:09.413 --> 26:11.620
All right, Codi.
You got away with this one.

26:11.689 --> 26:14.241
You got your one little
smooch in, but that is it.

26:14.310 --> 26:17.206
He ain't getting no more.

26:17.275 --> 26:21.931
You nasty.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.137
- Oh, it got cold as hell.

26:27.206 --> 26:30.586
- Somebody needs to get the gin
and the lemonade.

26:30.655 --> 26:32.931
It feels good to be back
with the boys.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.379
<i>We're actually laughing,
having a good time.</i>

26:34.448 --> 26:35.965
This is what we came
for vacations for.

26:36.034 --> 26:38.793
- Hey, imagine if at this point
in time we had to go back

26:38.862 --> 26:41.758
and be in Panama and do
five nights a week at La Vila

26:41.827 --> 26:43.379
like we did the first vacation.

26:43.448 --> 26:45.758
- It's so crazy 'cause we
didn't know each other then.

26:45.827 --> 26:47.137
- Not at all. At all.

26:47.206 --> 26:52.172
- How do you work this thing?
- I don't know.

26:52.241 --> 26:55.206
- I just want to hire
a professional.

26:55.275 --> 26:57.275
- Now we're all brothers, bro.
- Yeah, for real though.

26:57.344 --> 26:58.655
- That's the best part
about all this

26:58.724 --> 26:59.965
- We had some
crazy-ass times.

27:00.034 --> 27:01.172
- That's what I'm saying.

27:01.241 --> 27:02.551
- I'm definitely grateful
for that.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.137
- And the way that all you guys
rallied around me

27:04.206 --> 27:06.689
after my grandfather passed,
I was so appreciative of that.

27:06.758 --> 27:09.344
- God, I just want to ask that
you uplift Jeremiah

27:09.413 --> 27:10.724
and his family right now.

27:10.793 --> 27:12.448
Bring us together in that
we're able to remember

27:12.517 --> 27:15.413
the value of life, Lord Jesus.
Amen.

27:15.482 --> 27:17.586
- We love you, dude.

27:17.655 --> 27:21.137
- Going back home for Christmas
this year, man, like,

27:21.206 --> 27:23.206
seeing my grandmother
and actually, like, making,

27:23.275 --> 27:25.172
like, Christmas dinner
with her and like that,

27:25.241 --> 27:27.482
that was like--it just--

27:27.551 --> 27:28.965
it brought flashbacks
of the moment

27:29.034 --> 27:31.103
where I realized, you know,
I wasn't alone

27:31.172 --> 27:32.448
at all in the house,

27:32.517 --> 27:34.931
you know, and I'll always
be grateful for that.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.896
I really am.

27:40.620 --> 27:43.862
I'm sick of being in
the middle of

27:43.931 --> 27:45.655
No, for real.
- I feel you, dude. I feel you.

27:45.724 --> 27:47.275
- I love you on a whole
different level,

27:47.344 --> 27:48.689
big brother level.

27:48.758 --> 27:50.586
I love you on a level
that we just--

27:50.655 --> 27:53.862
we're actually starting
to become friends and

27:53.931 --> 27:55.310
<i>- We need to look at it
as like,</i>

27:55.379 --> 27:57.724
"Look, we're all different.
We're different colors.

27:57.793 --> 27:59.517
"We're different races.
We're different religions.

27:59.586 --> 28:01.517
But we make it work
in this house."

28:01.586 --> 28:03.034
- Personally if I had
to be selfish,

28:03.103 --> 28:05.413
I would rather you all fix
things on a different level.

28:05.482 --> 28:08.068
I'm not saying that
it's too soon, whatever.

28:08.137 --> 28:10.344
But I'm saying
for this vacation,

28:10.413 --> 28:12.310
can we all do this
the whole time?

28:12.379 --> 28:13.310
- Yeah, dude.
I think we're both on the--

28:13.379 --> 28:14.517
- Can y'all agree on that?

28:14.586 --> 28:15.758

28:15.827 --> 28:17.275

28:17.344 --> 28:18.517

I'll dab you up on that.

28:18.586 --> 28:20.310

<i>- You know, I definitely feel
like this truce with Jeremiah</i>

28:21.758 --> 28:23.586
will actually last this time
only due to the fact

28:23.655 --> 28:26.206
that we've completely exhausted
everything

28:26.275 --> 28:28.034

28:32.724 --> 28:34.655

28:34.724 --> 28:36.758

28:36.827 --> 28:38.068

a good time here.

I mean, it's only day two,

the right path of it.

28:43.103 --> 28:44.586
