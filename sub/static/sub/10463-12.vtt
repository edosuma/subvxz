WEBVTT

00:02.256 --> 00:04.484
These glasses need to go
back into the drawer.

00:04.508 --> 00:05.768
All right, okay.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.229
Hey.

00:12.016 --> 00:13.076
Kirsten.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.234
Hi.

00:15.770 --> 00:16.987
Hi.

00:18.272 --> 00:20.282
God, it's good to see you.

00:21.484 --> 00:24.004
I called last week to thank you

00:24.028 --> 00:25.755
for bailing us out with
that social worker.

00:25.779 --> 00:26.997
Did you get my message?

00:27.072 --> 00:28.749
Um, did I?

00:29.408 --> 00:31.710
Yeah. Sorry.

00:32.203 --> 00:35.056
I just... It's been kind of...

00:35.080 --> 00:36.183
Is everything okay?

00:36.207 --> 00:38.050
What? No. Yeah.

00:39.043 --> 00:40.719
I was just in the neighborhood,

00:41.504 --> 00:43.722
and I thought maybe you'd
want to do something.

00:44.381 --> 00:45.599
Yeah.

00:46.550 --> 00:47.944
Sure. Of course.

00:47.968 --> 00:50.030
Great. Have you had lunch?

00:50.054 --> 00:51.897
Wait. You mean now?

00:52.431 --> 00:54.242
Oh, is that not...

00:54.266 --> 00:56.485
No, I'd love to.
It's just, uh...

00:57.269 --> 01:00.823
I mean, I just got here.
I've got to work.

01:01.106 --> 01:03.992
Of course. God, I'm
such an idiot.

01:05.277 --> 01:07.913
So maybe dinner?

01:08.906 --> 01:10.342
Dinner.

01:10.366 --> 01:12.751
Yeah. Dinner's great.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074

01:26.799 --> 01:28.267
What the hell is that?

01:28.425 --> 01:30.153
It's a double sleeping bag.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.271
My parents used to use
it on family trips.

01:32.388 --> 01:33.647
Romantic.

01:33.973 --> 01:35.075
Ah, well, not really.

01:35.099 --> 01:37.369
Actually, I was always
pretty freaked about bears,

01:37.393 --> 01:38.954
so I'd usually climb
in with them.

01:38.978 --> 01:40.112
Bears?

01:42.398 --> 01:43.782
Don't worry.

01:45.067 --> 01:46.535
I'll protect you.

01:48.863 --> 01:50.257
God, I can't wait
to get out there.

01:50.281 --> 01:51.665
I just love camping.

01:51.782 --> 01:53.552
Just don't act too
jazzed around my dad.

01:53.576 --> 01:54.970
He'll get suspicious.

01:54.994 --> 01:56.054
What, you didn't tell him?

01:56.078 --> 01:57.722
Oh, right. "Bailey and
I are going camping.

01:57.746 --> 01:59.599
Just the two of us in a
double sleeping bag."

01:59.623 --> 02:00.725
So, what's he think?

02:00.749 --> 02:02.843
That Sarah invited me to Tahoe.

02:03.043 --> 02:04.604
What if he talks to
Sarah's parents?

02:04.628 --> 02:06.013
They think I'm going too.

02:06.171 --> 02:07.566
Sarah's going to tell
them at the last minute

02:07.590 --> 02:08.806
that I got the flu.

02:09.049 --> 02:10.651
Well, what if they call to
see how you're feeling?

02:10.675 --> 02:12.060
Then I'm dead.

02:13.888 --> 02:15.949
You know, we can put
this off, Kate,

02:15.973 --> 02:17.784
till the weekend when you're
at your mom's or something,

02:17.808 --> 02:18.743
because I can go anytime.

02:18.767 --> 02:21.486
No, what am I gonna do, let
him completely run my life?

02:22.021 --> 02:23.322
You could.

02:23.606 --> 02:25.532
What's life without
a little risk?

02:25.733 --> 02:28.076
Risk? Blech.

02:28.861 --> 02:30.954
Yeah, right. Blech.

02:32.907 --> 02:34.426
How about a video game?

02:34.450 --> 02:36.084
Um, we don't have any.

02:36.535 --> 02:39.129
Too bad. Mortal Kombat
is the coolest.

02:39.455 --> 02:41.006
But I could get some.

02:41.916 --> 02:43.268
I should probably go.

02:43.292 --> 02:45.302
But I thought you were
gonna stay till 8.

02:46.253 --> 02:49.514
I mean, well, last
time you stayed.

02:49.632 --> 02:51.183
Karate starts tomorrow.

02:51.550 --> 02:52.976
I have to try on my gi.

02:53.636 --> 02:56.396
But we were going to play
the Paganini tomorrow.

02:57.222 --> 02:59.358
We said we were going
to practice together.

02:59.892 --> 03:02.912
Oh. Well, we'll do
it some other time.

03:02.936 --> 03:04.363
What other time?

03:07.107 --> 03:08.325
When?

03:08.692 --> 03:09.910
I don't know.

03:10.110 --> 03:11.536
Whenever.

03:13.197 --> 03:14.748
See you when I see you.

03:23.332 --> 03:25.008
"See you when I see you"?

03:25.751 --> 03:27.344
What kind of line is that?

03:28.045 --> 03:29.596
<i>That's your career line.</i>

03:29.880 --> 03:31.932
Oh, yeah? How's it looking?

03:32.049 --> 03:33.526
Well, put it this way.

03:33.550 --> 03:35.477
Can you say, "Would you
like fries with that?"

03:35.803 --> 03:38.146
Thanks. That's great.
That's great.

03:38.305 --> 03:41.858
Okay, okay, my turn.
Let's see here.

03:42.559 --> 03:43.995
Ooh, strong fingers.

03:44.019 --> 03:45.445
From typing?

03:45.938 --> 03:48.740
Let me guess. You're
working on a thesis.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.952
A thesis? You mean, for college?

03:52.152 --> 03:54.130
You don't have a ton
of silver rings on,

03:54.154 --> 03:57.791
so I would say SF State
rather than Berkeley, right?

03:58.575 --> 04:01.128
It's not palm reading if
you have to ask questions.

04:01.161 --> 04:03.005
You're right. You're right.

04:03.038 --> 04:04.715
Okay, let's see here.

04:05.833 --> 04:08.176
Uh-huh. Your dating line.

04:08.877 --> 04:10.230
I don't know that one.

04:10.254 --> 04:11.930
Well, it's right
here, plain as day.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.151
I see a very clear image
of you having dinner

04:15.175 --> 04:17.101
at that new restaurant
on Mason tonight.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.363
Tonight. Am I alone?

04:19.387 --> 04:21.648
No, interestingly enough, no.
No.

04:21.807 --> 04:23.702
Actually, will you look at that?

04:23.726 --> 04:24.985
You're with me.

04:25.102 --> 04:25.996
Imagine.

04:26.020 --> 04:27.738
Wait, wait, wait. There's
more, there's more.

04:28.188 --> 04:30.365
I see you behind the
wheel of a car.

04:30.482 --> 04:31.418
Really?

04:31.442 --> 04:33.994
Yeah, can you drive? Because
my car's in the shop.

04:35.904 --> 04:36.965
Me? Drive?

04:36.989 --> 04:37.966
Yeah.

04:37.990 --> 04:39.708
Sure. Sure, I can.

04:47.541 --> 04:50.562
<i>♪ Everybody wants to live ♪</i>

04:50.586 --> 04:52.105
<i>♪ Like they wanna live ♪</i>

04:52.129 --> 04:55.608

04:55.632 --> 04:57.318

04:57.342 --> 05:00.729

05:00.971 --> 05:05.994

05:06.018 --> 05:08.987

05:18.280 --> 05:20.675
So there are a few
small hurdles.

05:20.699 --> 05:22.260
Nina, I have to find a car,

05:22.284 --> 05:24.512
get a license, and learn
how to drive by 8:00.

05:24.536 --> 05:27.005
Those are not small hurdles.
Those are biggish hurdles.

05:27.081 --> 05:28.673
What am I thinking?

05:29.625 --> 05:30.685
I should just forget it.

05:30.709 --> 05:33.021
No. Look, you said you
liked him, right?

05:33.045 --> 05:35.430
But it's ridiculous. I mean,
he thinks I'm in college.

05:35.714 --> 05:37.182
So? You will be soon.

05:37.299 --> 05:38.568
Three years is soon?

05:38.592 --> 05:40.393
I don't know, the more
I think about it...

05:40.552 --> 05:42.521
You think too much, Julia.

05:42.805 --> 05:44.439
Just keep it simple.

05:45.098 --> 05:46.618
You have fun with him, right?

05:46.642 --> 05:47.901
Yeah.

05:48.685 --> 05:50.112
Okay, then.

05:53.065 --> 05:55.001
You know, last night
when I was leaving,

05:55.025 --> 05:56.753
he found this crushed
flower on the floor,

05:56.777 --> 05:58.254
and he picked it up
and wiped it off

05:58.278 --> 05:59.464
and put it in my lapel.

05:59.488 --> 06:01.341
Oh, cute.

06:01.365 --> 06:02.467
Really cute.

06:02.491 --> 06:03.959
Really cute!

06:05.869 --> 06:06.930
So I take a cab,

06:06.954 --> 06:08.755
and I tell him my car's
in the shop too.

06:09.498 --> 06:11.133
Attagirl.

06:12.167 --> 06:13.937
It'll be weird though, because
there's so many things

06:13.961 --> 06:15.387
I can't talk about.

06:15.671 --> 06:18.066
Well, maybe not telling
him everything

06:18.090 --> 06:19.850
will actually work for you.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.477
Men love mysterious women.

06:31.186 --> 06:32.529
Hi, Artie.

06:34.189 --> 06:36.491
How unexpected that
we should meet.

06:37.276 --> 06:38.618
What do you mean?

06:38.986 --> 06:40.380
I come here every day.

06:40.404 --> 06:42.257
Uh, hey, Artie. Mint chip?

06:42.281 --> 06:43.415
Yeah.

06:43.574 --> 06:45.093
Do you want something
too, Claudia?

06:45.117 --> 06:49.296
Maybe I do, and maybe I don't.

06:49.788 --> 06:50.682
What's with you?

06:50.706 --> 06:51.882
Why?

06:51.999 --> 06:54.217
Do I seem mysterious?

06:54.918 --> 06:56.052
Yeah.

06:56.587 --> 06:58.054
When you think about it,

06:58.714 --> 07:00.849
how well do you really know me?

07:01.425 --> 07:04.936
Think of all the hidden
depths to my character.

07:05.888 --> 07:07.105
Do I have to?

07:07.681 --> 07:09.149
Uh, here you go, Art.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.942
Oh. Thanks.

07:11.059 --> 07:12.277
Thank you.

07:12.853 --> 07:15.780
Well... See you.

07:23.030 --> 07:24.132
Just hang on a sec.

07:24.156 --> 07:25.967
We'll get plates and
eat like real people.

07:25.991 --> 07:27.135
Forget about the plates.

07:27.159 --> 07:28.428
Let's get primitive.

07:28.452 --> 07:30.378
Think of it as practice
for the weekend.

07:31.288 --> 07:32.547
Weekend?

07:34.917 --> 07:37.010
Sarah's family's
into roughing it.

07:37.669 --> 07:38.887
Hey, Mr. Bishop.

07:40.339 --> 07:41.399
Good to see you again.

07:41.423 --> 07:42.682
Likewise.

07:42.925 --> 07:44.809
You know, Patricia
made dinner for you.

07:45.260 --> 07:47.113
Oh, sorry. I didn't know.

07:47.137 --> 07:49.115
Katie, next time you
go out for a walk,

07:49.139 --> 07:50.909
I think you should put
some more clothes on.

07:50.933 --> 07:51.993
It's embarrassing
to think of you

07:52.017 --> 07:53.661
running around town
in your underwear.

07:53.685 --> 07:55.121
What? These are normal clothes.

07:55.145 --> 07:56.947
Well, I've got to run,
or we'll be late.

07:57.564 --> 07:58.949
This came for you today.

07:59.733 --> 08:01.451
I took the liberty
of opening it.

08:02.027 --> 08:03.286
It's good news.

08:03.612 --> 08:05.413
You should be very
proud of yourself.

08:11.161 --> 08:12.504
He opens your mail?

08:12.955 --> 08:14.965
You can't be surprised.

08:17.834 --> 08:20.220
So, what did we win?

08:20.337 --> 08:21.638
Damn.

08:22.881 --> 08:24.525
"Dear Miss Bishop, we are
pleased to inform you

08:24.549 --> 08:26.653
that you've been
accepted to Hotchkiss

08:26.677 --> 08:28.728
as a mid-year transfer student."

08:29.888 --> 08:31.439
Transfer student? What is this?

08:31.598 --> 08:32.899
It's his idea.

08:34.058 --> 08:36.611
Kate, the address on this
letter says Connecticut.

08:37.312 --> 08:38.414
It's a boarding school.

08:38.438 --> 08:40.823
Your father wants to send
you to a boarding school?

08:40.982 --> 08:42.741
How long have you
known about this?

08:42.775 --> 08:44.869
You saw me get the
letter right now.

08:45.195 --> 08:47.548
Well, this... this isn't,
like, real, is it?

08:47.572 --> 08:49.207
I mean, how serious is he?

08:51.034 --> 08:52.961
Did he look like he
was joking to you?

08:56.206 --> 08:58.351
So after a year of it,
my parents realized

08:58.375 --> 09:00.228
paying all that tuition
for me getting drunk

09:00.252 --> 09:02.021
wasn't really cost-effective,

09:02.045 --> 09:03.481
so they yanked me out of school,

09:03.505 --> 09:04.816
and they sent me to rehab.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.766
Wow. How long ago?

09:07.301 --> 09:08.653
Oh, let's see.

09:08.677 --> 09:12.699
Four years, eight
months, 15 days.

09:12.723 --> 09:13.825
Give or take.

09:13.849 --> 09:15.317
That's right.

09:16.101 --> 09:17.328
So you're not freaked
out by that?

09:17.352 --> 09:19.571
No. Everyone has problems.

09:19.813 --> 09:21.197
Thanks.

09:21.940 --> 09:23.334
So tell me something else.

09:23.358 --> 09:24.576
No.

09:24.735 --> 09:26.202
We've been talking
about me all night.

09:26.361 --> 09:27.746
You tell me something.

09:28.322 --> 09:31.134
Tell me, uh, your
deepest, darkest secret,

09:31.158 --> 09:33.710
something you've
never told anyone,

09:33.952 --> 09:36.306
like, uh, you're a bed-wetter.

09:36.330 --> 09:37.473
Oh!

09:37.497 --> 09:39.809
Or you're a really
convincing transvestite.

09:39.833 --> 09:41.926
I promise I'm not.

09:42.252 --> 09:43.637
You're a Republican.

09:46.715 --> 09:48.058
You're beautiful.

09:49.801 --> 09:51.561
But that's not a secret, is it?

10:04.358 --> 10:06.826
Can we, uh, go back
to your place?

10:08.028 --> 10:11.206
Oh, um... I live
with this family.

10:11.365 --> 10:13.792
Not my family, another one.
I work for them.

10:13.867 --> 10:15.386
Oh, what are you, like, a nanny?

10:15.410 --> 10:16.971
Yeah, like that,

10:16.995 --> 10:19.547
and they're kind of
funny about visitors.

10:20.123 --> 10:21.633
All right.

10:25.253 --> 10:26.930
So I'll call you tomorrow?

10:27.130 --> 10:28.390
Okay.

10:28.548 --> 10:29.849
All right.

10:31.343 --> 10:32.602
Hey!

10:34.262 --> 10:35.647
Thanks.

10:36.139 --> 10:40.151
Oh, um, this family's kind
of funny about phones too.

10:40.310 --> 10:42.580
So if anyone other
than me picks up,

10:42.604 --> 10:44.447
you should just hang up, okay?

10:45.524 --> 10:46.825
Wow.

10:48.068 --> 10:50.078
Can't come over and
can't leave messages.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.747
Guy's got to put up with
a lot for you, huh?

10:52.823 --> 10:53.925
Do you mind?

10:53.949 --> 10:55.551
No, not at all.

10:55.575 --> 10:56.677
Hmm.

10:56.701 --> 10:57.961
Bye.

11:03.083 --> 11:04.477
Oh, God!

11:04.501 --> 11:06.886
I guess I didn't get
around to cleaning. Sorry.

11:07.337 --> 11:08.763
It's okay.

11:08.922 --> 11:10.807
I've seen this place
a mess before.

11:11.341 --> 11:14.144
In fact, I've made
it a mess before.

11:15.554 --> 11:17.657
So... how are you?

11:17.681 --> 11:19.274
I finished my course work.

11:19.558 --> 11:20.817
Did I tell you that?

11:20.976 --> 11:22.694
Does that mean I have
to call you "doctor"?

11:23.311 --> 11:25.196
Not until I do my dissertation.

11:26.648 --> 11:28.324
If I do my dissertation.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.118
Why wouldn't you?

11:30.402 --> 11:32.078
No, I'll do it.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.207
Anyway.

11:36.950 --> 11:38.126
Anyway.

11:38.743 --> 11:40.429
You know what? I'm
such an idiot.

11:40.453 --> 11:42.589
I meant to cook, and then...

11:43.415 --> 11:44.591
It's okay.

11:44.666 --> 11:46.727
I'm really am... I'm sorry. I...

11:46.751 --> 11:48.970
Kirsten, it's okay.

11:51.047 --> 11:52.682
To be honest with you, uh...

11:54.593 --> 11:56.436
Dinner wasn't the big draw.

11:59.848 --> 12:01.649
I've really missed you.

12:02.893 --> 12:04.194
So hi.

12:04.352 --> 12:05.737
Hi.

12:36.426 --> 12:40.615
It think it's actually against
the law to be up this early.

12:40.639 --> 12:41.949
Damn.

12:41.973 --> 12:43.233
Hey...

12:44.017 --> 12:45.735
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

12:46.019 --> 12:48.206
This stupid dryer.

12:48.230 --> 12:49.248
What's wrong with it?

12:49.272 --> 12:51.324
I don't know. It
just keeps stopping.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.576
It's probably a short.

12:54.361 --> 12:55.963
If you come back to bed,
I'll fix it for you.

12:55.987 --> 12:57.497
I can't.

13:02.410 --> 13:03.753
Hey.

13:04.496 --> 13:05.473
What's going on?

13:05.497 --> 13:06.839
Nothing.

13:07.749 --> 13:09.717
Well, then slow down a sec.

13:14.839 --> 13:16.349
Where are my keys?

13:25.892 --> 13:27.443
What's the deal, Kirsten?

13:27.519 --> 13:29.538
No deal. I just started my day.

13:29.562 --> 13:30.539
Yeah, well, me too.

13:30.563 --> 13:32.073
I was hoping to
start it with you.

13:32.691 --> 13:33.584
What's going on?

13:33.608 --> 13:35.368
I just... I have to get going.

13:40.740 --> 13:42.417
Lock the door behind you, okay?

13:49.082 --> 13:50.476
Mrs. Remsen, hi.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.760
Bailey, what a nice surprise.

13:53.044 --> 13:54.522
I hope you, uh,
you don't mind me

13:54.546 --> 13:55.439
just dropping in like this.

13:55.463 --> 13:57.608
Not at all. I just hope
you're here to buy some art.

13:57.632 --> 13:58.985
Business has been awful.

13:59.009 --> 14:00.810
Ah. Well, maybe next time.

14:01.052 --> 14:02.437
What's up?

14:03.388 --> 14:04.814
Well...

14:05.557 --> 14:07.660
I probably shouldn't have come
to you about this, but...

14:07.684 --> 14:09.161
About what?

14:09.185 --> 14:10.903
It's about this whole
boarding school thing.

14:11.313 --> 14:12.488
Oh.

14:12.772 --> 14:14.500
And I know that you and Mr.
Bishop,

14:14.524 --> 14:17.285
that you're not exactly
buddies, but Kate...

14:18.320 --> 14:20.747
I think she's scared to talk
to him about it herself.

14:21.281 --> 14:23.968
Well, he can be pretty imposing.

14:23.992 --> 14:25.094
Right.

14:25.118 --> 14:28.212
Right. So I was thinking
that maybe you could.

14:28.496 --> 14:30.766
You know, because
Kate going away,

14:30.790 --> 14:32.342
I think it's a bad idea.

14:32.542 --> 14:33.936
I mean, it's just so far away.

14:33.960 --> 14:34.895
Oh, I know.

14:34.919 --> 14:37.106
Listen, I was ballistic
about it at first.

14:37.130 --> 14:38.316
What mom wouldn't be?

14:38.340 --> 14:39.474
So why...

14:41.051 --> 14:44.488
I mean, no offense, but how could
you not do something about it?

14:44.512 --> 14:46.907
Well, because, sweetie,
she's a big girl.

14:46.931 --> 14:48.826
I have to let her make
her own decisions.

14:48.850 --> 14:50.286
If this is what she wants,

14:50.310 --> 14:51.829
if it'll make her happy,

14:51.853 --> 14:53.664
I owe it to her
to be supportive.

14:53.688 --> 14:55.490
Wait a second, you think
it's what she wants?

14:55.565 --> 14:58.868
Well, she didn't send away for all those
applications for nothing, did she?

14:59.110 --> 15:00.536
She, uh...

15:05.033 --> 15:06.501
Yeah.

15:08.036 --> 15:09.545
No, I guess not.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.632
Why is there an apostrophe?

15:12.874 --> 15:14.342
Snackwell's?

15:17.003 --> 15:18.388
Why hasn't he called?

15:18.880 --> 15:20.358
It doesn't really make
any sense, you know.

15:20.382 --> 15:22.892
It's not like they're made by a Mr.
Snackwell or anything.

15:22.926 --> 15:24.143
Hey, Bill...

15:25.011 --> 15:27.865
I've been getting a lot of those
really annoying phone calls.

15:27.889 --> 15:29.732
You know, the ones where
the caller just hangs up.

15:29.849 --> 15:31.985
- Have you been getting them too?
- No.

15:33.311 --> 15:36.280
I mean, not a lot.
Maybe just one today?

15:36.564 --> 15:37.907
No.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.576
You know, I can't even remember
the phone ringing today.

15:43.863 --> 15:45.456
Well, then, why don't
you just call him?

15:45.490 --> 15:47.083
What about being mysterious?

15:47.283 --> 15:48.260
Forget it.

15:48.284 --> 15:49.762
It's established that
you're mysterious,

15:49.786 --> 15:52.056
so now there's nothing mysterious
about being mysterious.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.798
Nina, you're starting to bug me.

15:54.374 --> 15:55.591
Fine.

15:57.794 --> 15:58.938
All right.

15:58.962 --> 16:00.638
All right, what do I do?

16:00.880 --> 16:02.098
Call him.

16:02.799 --> 16:04.851
<i>Or better yet, go over there.</i>

16:04.926 --> 16:06.153
<i>He's not expecting me.</i>

16:06.177 --> 16:07.947
<i>Exactly. It's unpredictable.</i>

16:07.971 --> 16:11.065
<i>Men love that, women they
can't quite figure out,</i>

16:11.766 --> 16:13.901
<i>women who are full of...</i>

16:14.185 --> 16:15.695
Surprise!

16:15.895 --> 16:17.321
What are you doing here?

16:17.605 --> 16:18.865
You're not in this class.

16:19.149 --> 16:20.459
Exactly.

16:20.483 --> 16:22.660
I bet this is the last thing
you'd predict I'd do.

16:22.736 --> 16:24.746
This is advanced
beginner, Claudia.

16:24.779 --> 16:26.173
Only kids who took
karate last year

16:26.197 --> 16:27.957
get to be in advanced beginner.

16:29.159 --> 16:30.886
You have to go to
beginner beginner.

16:30.910 --> 16:33.013
But you're not in
beginner beginner.

16:33.037 --> 16:34.213
So?

16:35.039 --> 16:37.258
Class is starting.
You're in the way.

16:40.420 --> 16:41.897
Hyah! Hut!

16:41.921 --> 16:43.639
- Hyah!
- Hut!

16:43.757 --> 16:45.735
You had no right to
talk to her about this.

16:45.759 --> 16:47.027
Yeah, well, do I have
the right to know

16:47.051 --> 16:48.362
what the hell is going on here?

16:48.386 --> 16:50.364
God, Kate, here I am
thinking things are great,

16:50.388 --> 16:51.741
and you're applying
to boarding schools.

16:51.765 --> 16:54.785
Okay, first of all, we were not
together when I sent away for these.

16:54.809 --> 16:55.995
I did that after you
broke up with me.

16:56.019 --> 16:57.288
And you didn't think
that was information

16:57.312 --> 16:59.081
worth sharing with me once
we got back together?

16:59.105 --> 17:01.000
- No, it isn't about you.
- If it's not about me,

17:01.024 --> 17:02.585
then why'd you feel the
need to lie about it to me?

17:02.609 --> 17:04.410
I didn't want to hurt you.

17:04.569 --> 17:08.498
Oh, yeah? Well, oops.
Have fun in Connecticut.

17:08.531 --> 17:10.290
No, wait, Bailey. Wait.

17:10.532 --> 17:12.720
Would you for one second
stop thinking about yourself

17:12.743 --> 17:14.545
and just think about what
this would mean for me?

17:14.913 --> 17:17.724
If I go to Hotchkiss, I'll get to
spend every night in the same bed.

17:17.749 --> 17:19.059
No more schlepping
over here on Sundays,

17:19.083 --> 17:20.310
no more having to put up with

17:20.335 --> 17:21.854
my father's constant criticism.

17:21.877 --> 17:24.190
I mean, God, Bailey, I
am so sick of that.

17:24.214 --> 17:25.640
Well, so he's strict.

17:25.757 --> 17:27.308
That's why you're leaving?

17:27.884 --> 17:29.268
He's not strict.

17:29.677 --> 17:31.020
He's mean.

17:31.721 --> 17:32.939
He hates me.

17:33.097 --> 17:34.909
He does. He hates
everything about me,

17:34.933 --> 17:37.110
the way I dress, all my friends,

17:37.435 --> 17:38.954
and nothing I ever
do is good enough.

17:38.978 --> 17:42.166
I get straight As, but I am
not the first in my class.

17:42.190 --> 17:44.784
I run track, but I didn't
make the tennis team.

17:44.859 --> 17:47.245
I try so hard, but
it's never enough.

17:47.487 --> 17:49.163
I just can't stand it anymore.

17:49.364 --> 17:53.000
Well, so why don't you just
live with your mom full-time?

17:53.785 --> 17:55.628
They share me. Joint custody.

17:55.995 --> 17:58.506
So? Get it revoked or something.

17:59.332 --> 18:00.716
I can't do that.

18:05.129 --> 18:06.889
Bailey, he's my dad.

18:11.427 --> 18:13.604
Besides, Hotchkiss
is a great school.

18:13.805 --> 18:16.315
Every January, 12 seniors
take a trip to Paris.

18:17.725 --> 18:19.235
No kidding?

18:19.853 --> 18:21.320
Paris.

18:25.608 --> 18:26.669
Hi.

18:26.693 --> 18:27.920
Hey, what's up?

18:27.944 --> 18:28.879
The sun.

18:28.903 --> 18:30.580
It's perfect weather
for a picnic.

18:31.239 --> 18:34.375
Oh, listen, Julia, it's
kind of a bad time...

18:34.409 --> 18:35.636
We got chicken, we got fruit,

18:35.660 --> 18:37.805
we got potato salad, I
make great potato salad,

18:37.829 --> 18:40.256
and we've got candles in
case we stay out past dark.

18:40.582 --> 18:43.301
So throw on some jeans,
and we'll hit Mount Tam.

18:44.085 --> 18:45.303
Now?

18:45.378 --> 18:46.888
Before the ice cream melts.

18:47.046 --> 18:48.472
Oh, boy. Um...

18:48.590 --> 18:50.192
Come on. I went to
all this trouble.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.767
No, no, no. I...

18:51.843 --> 18:53.311
I can't.

18:56.431 --> 18:57.732
Is someone here?

18:57.891 --> 18:59.734
No, no. I'm...

18:59.893 --> 19:01.694
You know, I'm just working.

19:02.604 --> 19:03.831
Oh.

19:03.855 --> 19:06.073
Look, I'm... I'm really sorry.

19:06.649 --> 19:08.492
Can... can you
call me next time?

19:09.903 --> 19:11.287
Sure.

19:12.155 --> 19:13.414
Yeah.

19:17.076 --> 19:18.336
Kirsten!

19:24.751 --> 19:26.260
I know what you're doing.

19:26.878 --> 19:28.596
Charlie, what are
you doing here?

19:29.923 --> 19:31.390
It's payback, right?

19:32.050 --> 19:35.863
I cheated on you, you treat me
like dirt, and we call it a draw.

19:35.887 --> 19:37.188
What?

19:37.764 --> 19:38.782
You're punishing me.

19:38.806 --> 19:40.524
That's not what I'm doing.

19:41.976 --> 19:44.028
Then maybe you want to tell
me what you were doing,

19:44.354 --> 19:46.206
because you clearly were not
doing what I was doing.

19:46.230 --> 19:48.449
- Which was what?
- What do you think?

19:49.400 --> 19:51.077
I was...

19:51.694 --> 19:53.005
I was... I don't know.

19:53.029 --> 19:54.747
I was trying to make
this work again.

19:55.114 --> 19:57.458
Then I owe you an apology.

19:58.409 --> 20:00.503
Look, it was just one
of those things.

20:00.662 --> 20:02.630
I'm sorry if you thought
it was something more.

20:03.498 --> 20:04.757
That's it?

20:05.375 --> 20:06.676
It's the best I can do.

20:09.045 --> 20:11.148
Look, let's just forget

20:11.172 --> 20:12.974
last night ever happened, okay?

20:16.636 --> 20:17.738
Hey, Kirsten, wait a minute.

20:17.762 --> 20:18.938
What?

20:19.681 --> 20:21.107
Well...

20:22.100 --> 20:25.361
If it wasn't to pay
me back, then why?

20:26.437 --> 20:27.655
Just...

20:28.523 --> 20:30.199
Because, okay?

20:31.901 --> 20:34.203
Because it's getting
dark earlier, and I...

20:36.656 --> 20:40.418
I guess I just thought having
somebody else there...

20:40.535 --> 20:44.380
Hey. What's up?

20:44.455 --> 20:46.090
Nothing.

20:46.708 --> 20:48.217
Kirsten, talk to me.

20:49.252 --> 20:51.929
It's not a huge deal, okay?

20:52.005 --> 20:54.223
In fact, it might be nothing,

20:54.298 --> 20:55.818
and it's definitely not anything

20:55.842 --> 20:57.351
that you need to worry about.

20:59.220 --> 21:00.646
What is?

21:04.684 --> 21:07.111
I might be a little
sick, that's all.

21:15.695 --> 21:17.214
I was thinking it was nothing.

21:17.238 --> 21:19.582
I mean, women's bodies can
be pretty unpredictable.

21:20.158 --> 21:22.168
Then I started getting
this pain too,

21:22.326 --> 21:24.045
so I went to my doctor.

21:24.495 --> 21:25.556
Uh-huh.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.465
She said it was this mass.

21:28.541 --> 21:30.134
A mass?

21:31.169 --> 21:32.386
Really? Where?

21:33.337 --> 21:34.732
It was my gynecologist, Charlie.

21:34.756 --> 21:36.015
It's not in my throat.

21:36.841 --> 21:38.142
Right.

21:38.342 --> 21:39.278
Anyway, she's sending me

21:39.302 --> 21:40.936
to a bunch of other doctors.

21:41.262 --> 21:43.824
I guess I can look forward to
a mess of tests and diagnoses

21:43.848 --> 21:45.159
this holiday season.

21:45.183 --> 21:46.525
Fa la la la la.

21:50.938 --> 21:52.573
You know, it could
be a lot of things,

21:53.399 --> 21:55.242
but it could be the big thing.

22:00.531 --> 22:02.249
You don't want to hear this.

22:02.992 --> 22:04.877
No, of course I do.

22:08.206 --> 22:09.882
The big thing, huh?

22:10.249 --> 22:12.760
How big are we talking about?
Bigger than a bread box?

22:14.420 --> 22:15.971
Is that supposed to be a joke?

22:16.005 --> 22:17.223
No.

22:18.091 --> 22:19.517
I'm sorry.

22:26.516 --> 22:28.150
Why didn't you
just say something

22:28.684 --> 22:29.985
last night?

22:30.228 --> 22:31.705
Because I didn't want
to be with anyone

22:31.729 --> 22:34.490
who's looking at me like you're
looking at me right now.

22:38.903 --> 22:40.663
Listen, you should just go home.

22:42.406 --> 22:43.791
Okay.

22:47.286 --> 22:48.754
Are... are you sure?

22:48.913 --> 22:50.798
Do you not want to
be alone right now?

22:51.290 --> 22:52.601
No, I'll be fine.

22:52.625 --> 22:53.644
In fact, I'm really tired.

22:53.668 --> 22:55.687
I just want to take a
bath and get into bed.

22:55.711 --> 22:57.429
You sure you don't
want me to stay?

22:57.505 --> 22:59.682
No. I'd just fall
asleep on you anyway.

23:00.758 --> 23:02.017
Okay.

23:17.024 --> 23:18.460
I just... I can't believe it.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.202
I mean, he was so nice to me.

23:20.444 --> 23:22.872
At the restaurant, he held
my hand under the table.

23:22.989 --> 23:24.508
He didn't kiss me
or touch my leg

23:24.532 --> 23:26.500
or anything like that.
He held my hand.

23:27.034 --> 23:30.671
Well, maybe there wasn't
another woman there, Jule.

23:31.080 --> 23:32.808
Maybe there's some
other explanation.

23:32.832 --> 23:34.758
There was a woman there.
Trust me.

23:34.834 --> 23:36.478
Oh. You don't know that.

23:36.502 --> 23:39.180
Yes, I do. You should have
seen how embarrassed he was.

23:40.590 --> 23:42.141
I feel so stupid.

23:42.925 --> 23:44.059
Look.

23:45.469 --> 23:47.938
Maybe we should think of this
as a blessing in disguise.

23:47.972 --> 23:49.157
How?

23:49.181 --> 23:52.526
Well, maybe it wouldn't
have worked out anyway.

23:52.894 --> 23:54.162
He is a lot older.

23:54.186 --> 23:55.080
So what?

23:55.104 --> 23:57.656
Anna Nicole Smith's husband
could be her grandfather.

23:58.774 --> 24:01.702
I could have fallen in
love with him so easily.

24:02.945 --> 24:05.122
Wait a minute. You had one date.

24:05.281 --> 24:06.258
A great date.

24:06.282 --> 24:09.553
Yeah, but, Jule, you never
mentioned anything about love

24:09.577 --> 24:11.462
until you found out
he had someone else.

24:12.246 --> 24:14.933
I mean, people are
always more attractive

24:14.957 --> 24:17.468
when you think someone
else has them.

24:17.752 --> 24:19.470
<i>In fact, you know what?</i>

24:20.421 --> 24:22.389
<i>Maybe that's what he was doing.</i>

24:22.423 --> 24:23.442
<i>What?</i>

24:23.466 --> 24:24.975
<i>Just trying to make you jealous.</i>

24:26.761 --> 24:28.030
Like this?

24:28.054 --> 24:30.782
You're supposed to be my
boyfriend, not my father.

24:30.806 --> 24:31.950
You know, Claud,
this whole thing

24:31.974 --> 24:33.692
just feels a little funky to me.

24:33.768 --> 24:35.694
Just work with me
here, Will, okay?

24:38.314 --> 24:39.573
Excuse me.

24:40.107 --> 24:41.700
Oh, you.

24:43.736 --> 24:44.713
Hey, Claudia.

24:44.737 --> 24:46.914
Oh. Hi, Artie.

24:48.282 --> 24:50.876
So, what can I get you, honey?

24:51.535 --> 24:52.888
She likes Rocky Road.

24:52.912 --> 24:54.838
I used to like Rocky Road.

24:55.331 --> 24:58.133
Now I prefer a more
mature flavor.

24:58.501 --> 25:00.970
Mature, right. So, um...

25:01.337 --> 25:02.856
Cappuccino Crunch?

25:02.880 --> 25:04.390
Cappuccino Crunch?

25:04.423 --> 25:05.734
Exactly.

25:05.758 --> 25:07.226
He knows me so well.

25:07.718 --> 25:09.603
Yeah, so well.

25:11.055 --> 25:12.606
You know, Claudia,

25:12.848 --> 25:15.025
I don't think we should
practice together anymore.

25:16.185 --> 25:17.403
What do you mean?

25:17.895 --> 25:19.989
You're not as much fun
as you used to be.

25:20.064 --> 25:22.199
I'd kind of rather
practice by myself.

25:25.277 --> 25:27.371
Was that part of
the plan too, or...

25:29.699 --> 25:31.083
Jule!

25:31.492 --> 25:33.553
I hope you don't
mind my dropping by.

25:33.577 --> 25:34.805
I know you don't like visitors.

25:34.829 --> 25:35.806
What?

25:35.830 --> 25:37.339
- Morgan.
- Hey.

25:37.498 --> 25:38.882
Hi.

25:40.876 --> 25:42.553
I'm sorry, I didn't
catch your name.

25:42.878 --> 25:43.939
I'm Charlie.

25:43.963 --> 25:45.681
Charlie, Morgan.
Morgan, Charlie.

25:46.257 --> 25:47.933
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

25:48.926 --> 25:51.645
Uh, where's Bill?
Owen needs a bath.

25:52.054 --> 25:53.439
I'll do it.

25:53.556 --> 25:54.898
It's his job.

25:55.141 --> 25:56.118
Bill!

25:56.142 --> 25:57.119
I...

25:57.143 --> 25:58.328
I thought you were the nanny.

25:58.352 --> 26:01.196
Oh, I am for the others.
Bill's for the baby.

26:01.230 --> 26:03.917
That guy's got other kids?
Seems really young.

26:03.941 --> 26:05.868
Oh, he's not a parent.
He's a son.

26:06.068 --> 26:07.421
Kind of old to be
living at home.

26:07.445 --> 26:08.547
He's just visiting.

26:08.571 --> 26:12.467
Jule, if Mr. Curran calls
about a cabinet job,

26:12.491 --> 26:14.460
tell him I'll be back
around 10 or so.

26:16.871 --> 26:18.255
He visits a lot.

26:18.372 --> 26:19.715
Yeah.

26:20.374 --> 26:22.102
Listen, Julia, I came by

26:22.126 --> 26:23.937
because of what
happened yesterday.

26:23.961 --> 26:25.605
It wasn't what you thought.

26:25.629 --> 26:27.232
Look, don't lie to me, okay?

26:27.256 --> 26:28.734
It's just going to
make things worse.

26:28.758 --> 26:29.975
I'm not going to lie.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.186
Okay.

26:32.928 --> 26:34.271
So what's her name?

26:34.555 --> 26:36.774
Carrie. Carrie Latham.

26:37.725 --> 26:39.193
Oh, my God, you're married?

26:41.812 --> 26:43.906
She just turned two.
She's my daughter.

26:44.899 --> 26:46.158
Oh.

26:47.568 --> 26:48.795
So, what about the mother?

26:48.819 --> 26:49.963
Well, we're friends.

26:49.987 --> 26:52.331
We never really were much more.

26:53.032 --> 26:55.542
Not a Dan Quayle
situation, but it works.

26:57.369 --> 26:59.630
I wanted to tell you, really,

27:00.247 --> 27:01.892
but I never know how
it's going to go over.

27:01.916 --> 27:03.801
You know, relationships
are hard enough.

27:04.085 --> 27:05.844
I guess I thought
if you knew, you...

27:06.587 --> 27:08.389
You might not want
to see me again.

27:10.049 --> 27:12.184
Well, it is a pretty
big surprise.

27:12.426 --> 27:13.737
I should have said something,

27:13.761 --> 27:15.238
but I didn't tell you before,

27:15.262 --> 27:17.106
so I guess I panicked.

27:17.139 --> 27:18.992
It was wrong, and it was stupid,

27:19.016 --> 27:21.735
so... here I am.

27:22.436 --> 27:24.488
I don't know what to say.

27:24.939 --> 27:27.366
If you can't deal with
this, I'll understand,

27:27.525 --> 27:29.419
because I like you too much
to risk blowing everything

27:29.443 --> 27:31.203
because I was too scared
to tell you the truth.

27:36.826 --> 27:38.669
I think I want one
with auto focus.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.754
Got to have auto focus.

27:40.955 --> 27:42.182
Can't have blurry
pictures of Paris.

27:42.206 --> 27:43.308
You know what else
it should have?

27:43.332 --> 27:45.676
That timer thingy, so we can
take pictures this weekend.

27:46.210 --> 27:48.887
We don't have any pictures
of us, you know that?

27:49.046 --> 27:50.857
Yeah, you know, about...
about that...

27:50.881 --> 27:53.110
No whining about having
your picture taken.

27:53.134 --> 27:54.935
No, I mean, this weekend.

27:55.678 --> 27:57.688
I don't think I'm going
to be able to make it.

27:58.556 --> 27:59.731
What?

28:01.100 --> 28:02.911
I've got all this
homework I've got to do.

28:02.935 --> 28:04.486
It just kind of piled up,

28:04.812 --> 28:05.988
so...

28:06.772 --> 28:09.751
Bailey, it's our last chance to
go away together before I leave.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.295
Yeah, well, I'm sorry,
but I'm failing chem,

28:12.319 --> 28:13.839
and I've got to do
better this semester,

28:13.863 --> 28:16.248
or else Social Services is
going to be on our case.

28:16.574 --> 28:18.301
Why don't you just
trade off chores

28:18.325 --> 28:20.002
with Julia and
Charlie this week?

28:20.035 --> 28:22.379
Hey, don't organize
my life for me, okay?

28:22.872 --> 28:24.474
If I say I can't do
it, I can't do it.

28:24.498 --> 28:25.559
But it was just an idea.

28:25.583 --> 28:27.727
Is there something wrong
with me telling you an idea?

28:27.751 --> 28:30.846
Just don't tell me what to do.
You always do that.

28:31.463 --> 28:32.890
- No, I don't.
- Yes.

28:34.216 --> 28:35.819
You treat me like I'm
a kid or something.

28:35.843 --> 28:37.102
You're always...

28:37.344 --> 28:39.772
You're always, like,
fixing my collar

28:39.889 --> 28:41.408
or reminding me not
to forget the keys.

28:41.432 --> 28:43.192
You know, I can take
care of myself.

28:45.269 --> 28:47.446
You're trying to ruin
this, aren't you?

28:47.980 --> 28:49.541
How can you say that?

28:49.565 --> 28:50.959
I'm not the one who's leaving.

28:50.983 --> 28:53.911
Well, I'm not the one who's ruining
the time that we have left.

28:54.737 --> 28:57.174
What do you think, that it'll
hurt less when I leave

28:57.198 --> 28:58.425
if we're mad at each other?

28:58.449 --> 28:59.958
I don't need this.

29:05.539 --> 29:07.267
He said it wouldn't
hurt or anything,

29:07.291 --> 29:08.675
but still...

29:09.293 --> 29:10.270
Mm-hmm.

29:10.294 --> 29:11.438
What's it called again?

29:11.462 --> 29:13.180
I told you, "laparoscopy."

29:15.174 --> 29:16.568
You think they call
it "laparoscopy"

29:16.592 --> 29:18.310
because they make the
incision in your lap?

29:19.595 --> 29:21.188
I don't know.

29:22.515 --> 29:23.658
Oh.

29:23.682 --> 29:25.859
I feel like I should go out
or something, you know,

29:25.976 --> 29:28.246
because this might be my last
night without really bad news.

29:28.270 --> 29:29.905
But I'm not in the mood.
I'm tired.

29:30.564 --> 29:32.491
We could go to that
new bar on Telegraph.

29:32.566 --> 29:34.743
I just said I'm tired,
and I'm not in the mood.

29:35.027 --> 29:36.004
Right, but...

29:36.028 --> 29:38.205
Are you even listening
to me just a little?

29:38.572 --> 29:39.466
What? I...

29:39.490 --> 29:41.041
Just forget it, Charlie.

29:47.206 --> 29:48.632
I'm sorry.

29:48.791 --> 29:49.851
Just forget it.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.093
No.

29:51.627 --> 29:53.220
I am. I'm sorry.

30:05.432 --> 30:06.692
What?

30:07.059 --> 30:08.328
God, that is the last thing

30:08.352 --> 30:10.070
on my mind right now.

30:11.939 --> 30:14.918
Okay. So sorry.

30:14.942 --> 30:16.743
Look, no.

30:19.572 --> 30:21.091
This was a mistake,
me coming to you.

30:21.115 --> 30:22.541
This isn't going to work.

30:23.826 --> 30:25.136
Why not?

30:25.160 --> 30:27.472
Because right now,

30:27.496 --> 30:29.474
what you're good at,
it's not what I need.

30:29.498 --> 30:31.258
Then tell me what you need.

30:31.458 --> 30:34.970
I need someone to remember the
name of the damn test, okay?

30:35.504 --> 30:37.274
Who isn't sitting there
thinking about sex

30:37.298 --> 30:39.850
when my whole reality
is shifting here.

30:40.968 --> 30:43.061
I need someone to
take care of me.

30:44.263 --> 30:45.856
I need a friend.

30:47.766 --> 30:49.443
I could be your friend.

30:50.853 --> 30:52.205
Look, Charlie,

30:52.229 --> 30:54.323
you and me, that's not
really our dynamic.

30:56.442 --> 30:58.368
Which doesn't make
you a bad person,

30:59.028 --> 31:00.422
but, look, I've got
a lot of people

31:00.446 --> 31:02.080
that I can turn to.

31:02.823 --> 31:04.050
I called my family today,

31:04.074 --> 31:05.876
and my sister's
going to come out.

31:07.911 --> 31:09.963
So you don't have to
worry about me, okay?

31:10.956 --> 31:12.382
No guilt.

31:12.416 --> 31:13.926
You're off the hook.

31:24.470 --> 31:25.771
What happened?

31:26.430 --> 31:29.284
Some jackass slashed my tire,
so I had to change it,

31:29.308 --> 31:31.536
but, of course, the lugs were
stuck, so it took forever.

31:31.560 --> 31:34.071
Now I probably need a new
tire, which I can't afford.

31:34.271 --> 31:35.290
Do you need help?

31:35.314 --> 31:36.374
Does it look like I do?

31:36.398 --> 31:37.584
Bailey, please don't do this.

31:37.608 --> 31:39.461
Look, I really don't want to
talk about this now, okay, Kate?

31:39.485 --> 31:41.046
Please, don't say
no to this weekend.

31:41.070 --> 31:42.839
It could be our last chance
to spend time together

31:42.863 --> 31:44.924
for a really long time. I
don't want to give that up.

31:44.948 --> 31:47.177
Yeah? Well, you can't
always get what you want.

31:47.201 --> 31:49.888
- I know that. -No, you don't.
You don't, Kate.

31:49.912 --> 31:52.057
Because all along, we've done
whatever you wanted to do.

31:52.081 --> 31:53.674
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

31:53.791 --> 31:55.143
It is, and most of the
time, it was okay,

31:55.167 --> 31:56.269
but we both know

31:56.293 --> 31:57.646
that when what you
wanted and what I wanted

31:57.670 --> 32:00.013
were different things, I
did not get what I want.

32:02.341 --> 32:04.559
Well, okay, then. Okay.

32:06.762 --> 32:07.697
Okay, what?

32:07.721 --> 32:09.231
Okay, you're right.

32:10.307 --> 32:11.858
Okay, that's true.

32:13.936 --> 32:15.821
I think we should both
get what we want.

32:18.565 --> 32:19.950
What are you saying?

32:21.610 --> 32:23.578
I think that's what
this weekend should be.

32:23.946 --> 32:27.499
I think we should go away
and really be together,

32:29.034 --> 32:30.669
like you wanted to.

32:34.498 --> 32:35.882
You...

32:36.333 --> 32:39.219
You mean... "together" together?

32:39.628 --> 32:41.138
Really together?

32:41.672 --> 32:42.889
Yeah.

32:43.590 --> 32:46.393
I want us to. Before I go.

32:57.688 --> 32:59.698
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:01.191 --> 33:02.627
Something up?

33:02.651 --> 33:04.578
No. No, I just...

33:05.362 --> 33:07.080
kind of had a question.

33:07.948 --> 33:09.416
Shoot.

33:10.367 --> 33:11.793
Well, it's...

33:11.952 --> 33:14.222
It's not a question, really.
It's just something to ask,

33:14.246 --> 33:15.557
and it's kind of personal,

33:15.581 --> 33:16.808
so if you don't
want to answer...

33:16.832 --> 33:18.675
If I don't want to
answer, I won't answer.

33:20.502 --> 33:22.637
Okay, here's the thing.

33:23.505 --> 33:25.182
I was wondering...

33:25.716 --> 33:27.934
You know, when
you're with a girl,

33:29.052 --> 33:31.688
is there, like, a right
way and a wrong way?

33:33.974 --> 33:35.192
To...

33:36.226 --> 33:37.203
Not really.

33:37.227 --> 33:38.361
No.

33:38.562 --> 33:40.197
I mean...

33:40.898 --> 33:42.365
You just...

33:43.442 --> 33:45.660
It's just whatever
happens, you know?

33:45.986 --> 33:48.330
So you just know,

33:49.156 --> 33:52.260
like, when you're there,
what specifically

33:52.284 --> 33:54.044
to do, right?

33:54.703 --> 33:57.506
I mean, you want to make sure

33:57.956 --> 34:01.102
that, you know, she's cool
with what's going on too.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.312
Oh, yeah.

34:02.336 --> 34:04.596
Right. Yeah, of course.

34:06.340 --> 34:07.766
And how do you know that?

34:07.966 --> 34:09.391
You can tell if it's,

34:10.302 --> 34:12.071
you know...

34:12.094 --> 34:14.282
And if it's not,

34:14.306 --> 34:17.400
then you just... you
do something else.

34:19.311 --> 34:20.654
Okay.

34:21.980 --> 34:23.532
Thanks.

34:24.399 --> 34:25.742
Hey, Bay.

34:26.360 --> 34:27.920
The sex,

34:27.945 --> 34:31.123
that's the easy part.

34:31.739 --> 34:33.375
The sex, you'll figure out.

34:33.867 --> 34:35.668
It's everything
else that's hard.

34:44.670 --> 34:47.347
Well, maybe I left the wrong number,
and that's why he didn't call.

34:48.507 --> 34:49.891
Yes.

34:52.427 --> 34:54.646
No, that's right.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.575
Okay.

34:57.599 --> 34:58.984
Bye, Mrs. Baum.

35:00.519 --> 35:02.112
What was that about?

35:02.938 --> 35:04.239
Artie.

35:05.232 --> 35:07.001
He doesn't want to
be my friend anymore

35:07.025 --> 35:08.285
Why not?

35:08.443 --> 35:10.745
Because I made him think
Will was my boyfriend.

35:10.946 --> 35:12.340
Why?

35:12.364 --> 35:14.124
Because nothing else worked.

35:14.449 --> 35:16.209
I tried being mysterious.

35:16.410 --> 35:18.888
He got mad, so I tried
surprising him.

35:18.912 --> 35:22.507
He got mad. Everything
I did, he got mad.

35:23.083 --> 35:24.060
Of course he did.

35:24.084 --> 35:25.844
Sounds to me like you're
trying to mess with him.

35:26.128 --> 35:28.430
You don't mess with people
you care about, Claudia.

35:28.881 --> 35:30.223
What are you talking about?

35:30.340 --> 35:32.267
What about you and
what's-his-name,

35:32.634 --> 35:34.269
you know, the guy
that's too old?

35:34.553 --> 35:36.364
Like pretending
you're in college

35:36.388 --> 35:38.106
and that you drive and stuff.

35:40.017 --> 35:41.818
If you can do it, why can't I?

35:43.896 --> 35:47.782
Oh, my God, Claudia, we
really need to have a talk.

35:51.445 --> 35:52.662
There she is.

35:53.238 --> 35:54.623
Before you say anything,

35:55.032 --> 35:56.301
let me explain.

35:56.325 --> 35:57.886
Oh, it's you.

35:57.910 --> 35:59.419
Just hear me out.

35:59.494 --> 36:00.889
I'm sorry.

36:00.913 --> 36:03.182
I'm sorry about acting so weird.

36:03.206 --> 36:05.091
I'm sorry about coming
to your karate class,

36:05.334 --> 36:06.801
and that guy,

36:07.711 --> 36:09.679
he's not really my boyfriend.

36:10.464 --> 36:12.724
Gee, what a surprise.

36:12.883 --> 36:16.353
Well, I guess I was trying
to make you jealous.

36:16.929 --> 36:17.906
Why?

36:17.930 --> 36:19.991
Because you started karate,

36:20.015 --> 36:23.276
and you stopped hanging out
with me, and I guess...

36:23.685 --> 36:26.154
I guess I was trying
to get your attention.

36:26.855 --> 36:30.200
You know, so you'd want
to hang out more again.

36:30.901 --> 36:32.535
Why didn't you just say so?

36:33.362 --> 36:34.621
Okay.

36:36.698 --> 36:38.250
I want to hang out more.

36:39.034 --> 36:40.418
Okay.

36:40.452 --> 36:41.836
Sure.

36:49.211 --> 36:50.271
Do you have...

36:50.295 --> 36:51.721
Yeah, I brought some.

36:54.549 --> 36:56.027
Are you sure you're okay?

36:56.051 --> 36:57.695
Yeah, it's just... go on.

36:57.719 --> 36:59.187
Okay.

37:10.524 --> 37:12.575
You don't really want
to do this, do you?

37:13.276 --> 37:14.995
No, it's okay, you can.

37:16.697 --> 37:18.206
I can?

37:19.449 --> 37:20.426
Kate...

37:20.450 --> 37:21.876
What?

37:22.828 --> 37:24.713
I don't want to
make you do this.

37:25.163 --> 37:27.424
You're not. I told you.
I want us to.

37:27.624 --> 37:30.802
Why? Why are you doing this?

37:32.379 --> 37:34.848
Because I'm going away,

37:35.215 --> 37:38.310
and you're not going to be driving
me to school every morning,

37:38.885 --> 37:40.446
and you're not going to
be calling me every night

37:40.470 --> 37:41.896
before you go to bed anymore.

37:42.514 --> 37:45.317
I don't know, you know, we're not
going to have any of that stuff,

37:46.351 --> 37:48.194
and maybe you'll
forget about me,

37:49.479 --> 37:52.417
but if we have this, you know,
instead of all that other stuff,

37:52.441 --> 37:54.075
maybe you won't forget.

37:55.318 --> 37:57.120
Maybe it'll keep us together.

37:59.322 --> 38:00.582
God.

38:01.575 --> 38:03.001
Kate.

38:03.035 --> 38:04.294
What?

38:07.247 --> 38:09.257
This is not a reason to do this.

38:11.918 --> 38:13.511
You're mad.

38:14.713 --> 38:16.514
No. No.

38:19.217 --> 38:20.685
I'm sorry.

38:22.137 --> 38:23.521
Look,

38:23.930 --> 38:26.524
I don't know what's going
to happen with us, Kate,

38:27.184 --> 38:29.444
but you're going away
for a really long time,

38:31.146 --> 38:33.166
and, I don't know, I just...

38:33.190 --> 38:35.877
I have this image of
Hotchkiss being this place

38:35.901 --> 38:41.758
full of really good-looking,
athletic, smart guys,

38:41.782 --> 38:44.010
and they're gonna all
want to go out with you,

38:44.034 --> 38:46.961
and for you to give up
something that's so important

38:47.579 --> 38:49.881
just to try to hang on to me.

38:50.832 --> 38:52.884
It just doesn't make any sense.

38:54.711 --> 38:56.388
Because someday,

38:57.464 --> 38:59.108
you're going to want to
spend the rest of your life

38:59.132 --> 39:00.683
with a guy.

39:01.593 --> 39:03.571
And you know that you
want to look at him

39:03.595 --> 39:05.772
and tell him he's the only one.

39:09.309 --> 39:11.319
Maybe that guy will be you.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.699
Yeah, maybe.

39:31.957 --> 39:33.716
- Hi.
- Hey.

39:34.793 --> 39:36.261
For Carrie.

39:37.420 --> 39:39.180
So we're okay here? We're cool?

39:39.214 --> 39:41.975
Yeah. Very okay, very cool.

39:43.009 --> 39:44.904
Listen, can we go
talk somewhere?

39:44.928 --> 39:47.657
Uh, there's something I
need to tell you too.

39:47.681 --> 39:48.950
Yeah, sure, sure.

39:48.974 --> 39:50.201
Mr. Latham.

39:50.225 --> 39:51.786
Oh, Jule, can it wait one sec?

39:51.810 --> 39:53.246
I've just got to take
care of some stuff here.

39:53.270 --> 39:54.163
Sure.

39:54.187 --> 39:55.206
Thanks.

39:55.230 --> 39:56.614
What were you saying?

39:56.731 --> 39:59.335
Yeah, yeah, your liquor
licenses, they're all fine

39:59.359 --> 40:00.294
and up-to-date,

40:00.318 --> 40:03.339
and I just thought I'd do
an ID check on my way out.

40:03.363 --> 40:04.549
Well, everyone's all right here.

40:04.573 --> 40:06.801
I mean, our bouncer can
spot a fake a mile away.

40:06.825 --> 40:08.168
I'm sure he can.

40:08.702 --> 40:11.129
Well, what do you say
we start with...

40:11.329 --> 40:12.922
with you guys right
here at the bar?

40:21.339 --> 40:22.441
What are you...

40:22.465 --> 40:23.693
I was in bed.

40:23.717 --> 40:25.268
Okay, fine.

40:25.427 --> 40:27.187
Go ahead and get back in bed.

40:27.971 --> 40:29.606
I'm serious. Hop in.

40:29.848 --> 40:30.783
Charlie...

40:30.807 --> 40:32.025
Listen,

40:32.517 --> 40:33.902
this is the thing.

40:36.771 --> 40:40.376
It's Friday night, and
I'm at the supermarket,

40:40.400 --> 40:42.211
and I have this incredibly
long list of things

40:42.235 --> 40:43.953
that I have to do
for everyone else.

40:44.404 --> 40:46.299
I'm going along, feeling
sorry for myself,

40:46.323 --> 40:48.958
and suddenly, I see...

40:50.202 --> 40:51.304
A hair dryer.

40:51.328 --> 40:52.837
Yours is busted,

40:53.163 --> 40:56.174
and without even thinking about
it, I put it in the cart,

40:56.499 --> 40:58.593
and then I remembered
your toothbrush.

40:59.252 --> 41:00.521
I used it the other day,

41:00.545 --> 41:01.606
and the bristles

41:01.630 --> 41:02.732
are all raggedy, so...

41:02.756 --> 41:04.066
You got me a new one.

41:04.090 --> 41:07.560
Green. Match the walls
in your bathroom.

41:07.844 --> 41:10.364
And... tuna fish,

41:10.388 --> 41:11.856
because I know you like it,

41:12.015 --> 41:13.566
and it lasts forever.

41:13.767 --> 41:15.036
Charlie...

41:15.060 --> 41:16.245
You don't like my presents.

41:16.269 --> 41:17.654
No, I love them,

41:18.396 --> 41:20.124
but what's going on?

41:20.148 --> 41:21.125
Why are you doing this?

41:21.149 --> 41:24.827
Well, see, this is interesting.

41:26.488 --> 41:28.915
I wasn't exactly sure myself,

41:30.158 --> 41:32.303
but then I... I
realized something.

41:32.327 --> 41:35.004
I realized I love you.

41:38.083 --> 41:40.019
And, uh,

41:40.043 --> 41:43.638
I can't not be here for you, I
can't not take care of you,

41:44.381 --> 41:48.319
because when you love someone, and...
and they need something,

41:48.343 --> 41:49.946
you have to get it for them.

41:49.970 --> 41:52.105
It's, it's-... You
have no choice.

41:52.264 --> 41:53.407
It's weird.

41:53.431 --> 41:56.035
It's like this wave

41:56.059 --> 41:57.912
that propels you
over the Bay Bridge

41:57.936 --> 42:00.029
with your dopey
little tuna cans.

42:00.689 --> 42:02.448
It's... Ah.

42:03.441 --> 42:05.159
I love you, Kirsten.

42:06.695 --> 42:07.755
Charlie, I...

42:07.779 --> 42:10.123
And it has nothing
to do with sex.

42:12.200 --> 42:16.421
What you said about...
needing a friend,

42:17.122 --> 42:18.631
that's me.

42:19.708 --> 42:21.384
I am your friend.

42:22.294 --> 42:23.720
I mean, I just...

42:24.504 --> 42:28.224
You're scared, and I can't stand not
being able to try to make it better,

42:29.009 --> 42:31.185
whatever it is,
whatever happens.

42:34.180 --> 42:35.857
It's not cancer.

42:36.683 --> 42:38.401
I'm not going to die.

42:38.893 --> 42:40.278
I saw the doctor.

42:45.900 --> 42:47.327
But it is something?

42:52.073 --> 42:55.918
A malformation of
my fallopian tubes.

42:57.287 --> 42:59.005
Is that bad?

42:59.247 --> 43:00.590
Is that dangerous?

43:01.041 --> 43:02.300
What does that mean?
