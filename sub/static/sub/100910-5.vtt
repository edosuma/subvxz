WEBVTT

00:05.423 --> 00:06.924
Previously on Hightown...

00:06.966 --> 00:08.467
Remember when I was your snitch?

00:08.509 --> 00:09.468
Tell you what I'm driving,

00:09.510 --> 00:11.178
make it easier for you
when you tailing my ass.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.888
- Fucking following me?
- What are you doing?

00:12.930 --> 00:14.473
Tell me where Krista is!

00:14.515 --> 00:16.434
Plymouth Rock Motor Court in
Bourne-- fucking cunt.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.227
You know anything about a girl
named Krista Collins?

00:18.269 --> 00:21.105
I think she might know something
about that thing happened out in
Truro.

00:21.147 --> 00:22.565
You know what?
I'm gonna leave a note.

00:22.606 --> 00:23.899
- What?
- What the fuck?

00:23.941 --> 00:25.276
Did you tell
someone where I was?

00:25.317 --> 00:27.737
My friend died.
Fucking saw it, too.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.739
But, Scotty,
you can't tell anybody.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.324
- Yes.
- I am back, motherfuckers!

00:32.366 --> 00:34.076
- And I fucking found her, man.
- What?

00:34.118 --> 00:35.161
I found Krista.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.829
I went to rehab.
I'm sober.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.622
- Really?
- How about dinner tomorrow?

00:38.664 --> 00:39.874
Like a date?

00:39.915 --> 00:42.460
- Still not fucking you, Ron.
- Ah, your loss.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.191
Fuck.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.035
Oh, God.

02:40.077 --> 02:43.122
Ugh, dude, why are you naked?

02:43.163 --> 02:45.499
I'm a hot sleeper.
What?

02:46.333 --> 02:47.751
Fuck.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.837
Sorry.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.427
I feel like shit.

03:00.598 --> 03:02.766
Ugh, did I do
anything last night

03:02.808 --> 03:06.729
that I ought to know about,
like in front of Hunniker?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.814
You don't remember?

03:08.856 --> 03:11.150
What do you mean
I don't remember? What?

03:13.152 --> 03:15.529
Let's just say, nice rack, Jack.

03:15.571 --> 03:18.866
No.
Oh, fuck, no, no, no, no, no.

03:18.908 --> 03:21.076
What happened?

03:21.118 --> 03:22.912
You put your tits on the bar.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.371
- Oh!
- You were a fucking animal.

03:24.413 --> 03:28.250
Fuck me. Fuck!

03:28.292 --> 03:30.419
I'm just fucking with you.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.504
Jesus, you really don't
remember shit, do you?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.298
You're just--

03:34.340 --> 03:37.217
You know what?
You fucking asshole!

03:37.259 --> 03:39.720
Hey.
You were fine.

03:39.762 --> 03:41.263
Hunniker gave you
a second chance.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.307
You got your job back.
You're invincible.

03:43.349 --> 03:44.558
Must be nice to
be a pretty girl.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.226
Shut the fuck up.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.269
Oh, God.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.938
Ugh, so what you got
going on today?

03:48.979 --> 03:50.189
- You want to...
- Oh, Jesus!

03:50.230 --> 03:52.566
Go get some breakfast,
maybe we hang out,

03:52.608 --> 03:53.984
you know, weather the storm?

03:54.026 --> 03:55.653
No, just go home, Ron.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.863
- Well, can I take a shower
first? - No.

03:59.657 --> 04:04.036
Oh, fuck. No, no, no.
Oh, fuck me!

04:04.078 --> 04:06.246
Damn it, I was expecting
an important call.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.248
Hey, it's okay.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.625
I got a trick for that.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.386
Hey, Frances...

05:02.428 --> 05:04.555
Give me a Bloody Mary.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.309
- So Delgado, AKA--
- Osito.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.812
- Osito...
- Yes, Counselor.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.815
Works at O'Donnell's
Auto Services.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.734
Yes.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.569
No. Well, he's not actually
employed there.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.362
We believe that's where
he gets his vehicles.

05:21.989 --> 05:22.906
And the residence?

05:22.948 --> 05:24.867
Kathleen O'Donnell's residence,
his girlfriend.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.869
And he lives there?

05:26.910 --> 05:29.913
Stays there sometimes...

05:29.955 --> 05:32.041
we think.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.376
So you want to bug a residence
Delgado doesn't live in

05:34.418 --> 05:36.211
and a private business
where he doesn't work?

05:36.253 --> 05:39.381
Yes, and we'd also like to, uh,
put a state wiretap on his cell
phone.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.592
I don't see any judge
signing off on this.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.096
Well, why don't you tell me
what a judge will sign,

05:46.138 --> 05:47.681
and I'll just make sure
it's in there?

05:47.723 --> 05:50.392
No shortcuts, Sergeant.
You need to show exhaustion.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.187
Pole cams, controlled buys,
trash pulls-- let me see your
work.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.898
Okay, listen, with all due
respect, this guy's a fucking
killer.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.067
I don't have time to exhaust
every possibility.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.069
You DAs are so concerned
with batting .1000,

06:00.110 --> 06:01.570
you're not even willing to
take a fucking swing, are you?

06:01.612 --> 06:03.489
You're a good investigator, Ray,

06:03.530 --> 06:05.866
but your reputation
in the DA's office is

06:05.908 --> 06:08.077
that you're not effective
on the witness stand.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.204
What are you talking about?
Juries love me.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.581
No, they think
you're an asshole.

06:12.623 --> 06:15.084
Do your job, Sergeant,
then you can tell me how to do
mine.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.085
You know what?

06:16.126 --> 06:18.087
Thank you for meeting with us
on a Saturday, Amanda.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.213
Yep.

06:25.344 --> 06:29.556
You ever hear the expression
"you catch more flies with
honey"?

06:29.598 --> 06:32.893
Just once I'd like to see a DA
stick their neck out like we
fucking do every day.

06:32.935 --> 06:35.312
No, seriously,
you keep pissing off the brass,

06:35.354 --> 06:38.774
and one day,
they're gonna give me your job.

06:38.816 --> 06:43.320
Yeah, Sergeant Alan Saintille--
has a nice ring to it.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.697
You know what?
Go fuck yourself.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.824
So now what?

06:50.994 --> 06:52.579
We show her exhaustion.

07:07.511 --> 07:09.012
Well, lookee here.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.057
J to the Q, holding it down
at the P and J, huh?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.934
Hey, what's up?

07:13.976 --> 07:16.395
Not much, you?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.939
- Just fucking say it.
- What?

07:18.981 --> 07:20.399
I know you see me drinking
this beer.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.026
Oh, shit, that?
I didn't notice.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.903
Yeah.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.613
It was just a work
thing last night.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.240
It got a little out of hand.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.243
That happens, but you got
to get back on the horse.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.078
The judge is gonna fuck you
for reals.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.997
A felony DUI's no joke.

07:36.165 --> 07:37.708
Look, tomorrow
we're gonna get together.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.293
We're gonna start
working the steps.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.128
Yeah, listen, about that,
I got a lot on my plate, all
right?

07:41.170 --> 07:43.589
I got my job back.
I ju--I can't do AA right now.

07:45.174 --> 07:46.925
Are you still
on that Nancy Drew tip?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.719
I told you,
I already found her.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.345
Nancy Drew, my twat.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.347
You talk to her?

07:52.389 --> 07:54.641
No, not yet.
My phone's dead.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.436
Yeah, so, like, uh,
where is she?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.897
You don't have to pretend
like you still care about this,
okay?

07:59.938 --> 08:01.356
- I get it.
- All right, fine. Whatever.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.150
- Take care of yourself.
- Hey, hey, hey.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.652
Listen, I got a date
with Devonne later tonight,

08:05.694 --> 08:07.154
and I need a little something

08:07.196 --> 08:08.947
to get me back
into fighting shape.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.741
You got any blow?

08:10.782 --> 08:13.035
Jackie, I'm your
fucking sponsor.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.245
No, no, no.
I fired your ass.

08:15.287 --> 08:17.623
So now you're just Junior,
and you're a drug dealer.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.250
So deal some fucking drugs,
or I'm gonna get 'em somewhere
else.

08:20.292 --> 08:21.418
Nice try.

08:26.924 --> 08:30.219
- Hey, Frances, one more?
- You got it.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.851
Hey, Javi.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.103
It's Ray Abruzzo.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.357
- You got a problem here.
- Yeah, I'm with a customer.

08:43.398 --> 08:44.483
I'll be with you in a second.

08:44.524 --> 08:48.028
You take your time, man.
I got all day.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.822
- Your Jeep should be ready in a
few days. - All right.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.409
Hey, what's up?

08:54.451 --> 08:56.954
"What's up"?

08:56.995 --> 09:00.082
Emmanuel Delgado,
that's what's up.

09:00.123 --> 09:04.127
Osito...uses your place
as his personal rent-a-car,

09:04.169 --> 09:07.047
uses your fleet
to deal drugs, mule,

09:07.089 --> 09:09.007
commit a couple murders.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.676
You know what I'm talking about.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.471
All right, you want me to break
it down real simple for you?

09:14.513 --> 09:16.223
I'm State Police,
which means wherever you go

09:16.265 --> 09:18.183
in this whole goddamn
Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

09:18.225 --> 09:19.643
I can fucking find you.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.520
I'm the tip of the spear,
motherfucker,

09:21.561 --> 09:24.439
and I'm pointed right at you.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.899
What the fuck you looking at?

09:25.941 --> 09:28.235
You know I got ICE
on speed dial, right?

09:28.277 --> 09:29.945
You want to start pulling
green cards,

09:29.987 --> 09:31.488
we can go that route.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.948
You see what they do
these days, right?

09:32.990 --> 09:34.366
Kids in cages?

09:34.408 --> 09:36.243
Yeah, that's some
fucked-up shit, man.

09:36.285 --> 09:39.204
So, yo, here's
the scoop, Javier.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.290
You, you work for me now.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.625
You tell me
when Osito comes and goes.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.336
You tell me what car he's in
and who's in it with him.

09:46.378 --> 09:49.298
And you do that, maybe,
just maybe you stay out of jail.

09:49.339 --> 09:52.050
Oh, man, I'm fucking you
one way or the other,

09:52.092 --> 09:54.303
and it's up to you
if I use lube or not.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.473
Push a man hard enough,
he's got no choice

09:58.515 --> 10:00.225
- but to fight back.
- Hmm?

10:00.267 --> 10:03.395
Maybe break some little dealer
kid with that thick-dick act,

10:03.437 --> 10:05.772
but you come at me that hard...

10:05.814 --> 10:08.150
you know I got to tell you
to go fuck yourself.

10:08.191 --> 10:11.278
So go fuck yourself.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.530
And don't come back
without a warrant.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.743
Hey, it's your loss, my friend.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.952
See you later.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.893
So you distract him with your
best asshole impression?

10:42.934 --> 10:44.394
I tried.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.355
How we coming
with the surveillance cams?

10:46.396 --> 10:48.982
Almost done,
and Kathleen's place is up
already.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.401
All right.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.697
Hi, I'm Junior, alcoholic.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.702
Uh, y'all hear from me every
week, so I'm gonna keep it
short.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.163
Things are all right.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.957
I'm getting back with my girl,
seeing my kid again.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.793
So it's good.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.505
You know, that's what
I do it for, family.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.633
Something bigger than myself.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.552
It's not like I'm out here
alone, you know, floating in
space.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.638
If I was, you know,
it wouldn't matter, I could use.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.140
So what?

11:22.182 --> 11:26.019
But I'm not, so it's pretty-
it's pretty fucking good.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.106
Anyways, we got another speaker.
Give it up for my boy.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.323
Name is Osito...

11:38.365 --> 11:39.741
and I'm an addict.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.326
Hi, Osito.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.997
Meeting's over. Come on.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.958
- Let's go, ladies, move out.
- Let's go.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.460
Back in line.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.337
You too.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.929
Yo, this AA hustle is tight.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.265
Even got my felon
ass up in here.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.225
It's not just a hustle.
We're carrying the message.

12:05.267 --> 12:06.268
Enough.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.644
We need to talk
about this witness shit

12:07.686 --> 12:09.271
that Scotty told you about.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.439
What do you think, J?

12:12.441 --> 12:15.402
I-I don't know.
Uh, some chick talking?

12:15.444 --> 12:16.820
No big thing.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.616
And you?

12:21.658 --> 12:24.119
Probably nothing.

12:24.161 --> 12:26.329
You're half Haitian, right?

12:26.371 --> 12:27.998
Is that why you're
so fucking stupid?

12:28.039 --> 12:29.416
I'm locked up,

12:29.458 --> 12:31.501
and even I know that bitch
is running her mouth,

12:31.543 --> 12:34.671
said she saw some fat-ass
black guy shoot her friend.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.717
Sound like anyone we know?

12:38.758 --> 12:39.968
Huh, pendejo?

12:45.140 --> 12:46.099
You're right.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.645
We fucked up.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.898
We're gonna fix it.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.441
F-fix it how?

12:55.734 --> 12:57.777
Mátala.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.529
What the fuck does that mean?

12:59.571 --> 13:01.656
We can-we can talk to her,

13:01.698 --> 13:03.909
you know, tell her to keep
her mouth shut.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.828
Oh, shit, is he for real?

13:06.870 --> 13:09.539
Get her off the books.

13:09.581 --> 13:10.665
It's done, padrón.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.003
And this one won't float.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.338
No, fuck that.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.465
Serve her ass with a hot shot.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.718
Junkie ODs on The Cape,
cops barely even notice.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.930
What about that lady
asking questions in the rehab?

13:26.389 --> 13:27.849
You could do that, too.

13:27.891 --> 13:30.310
Wait, ho-ho-hold up.
"Too"?

13:30.352 --> 13:32.270
No, that's crazy.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.523
That lady,
she-she ain't nothing.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.775
How do you know?

13:36.816 --> 13:39.110
Got people in rehab,
looked into it.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.196
Turns out it's a lady I know...

13:41.238 --> 13:42.781
a fishery service agent.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.700
She's nobody,
fucking crazy bitch.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.244
You don't need to do anything
about that.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.703
Just take care
of the one thing,

13:48.745 --> 13:50.497
and the other isn't even
a problem anymore.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.084
Okay.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.585
Just the one.

13:57.295 --> 14:00.715
Kizzle's inside
on some bullshit assault thing,

14:00.757 --> 14:01.883
so take him.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.727
No fucking way.
I'm not going.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.771
You, like, six
steps behind, bro.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.899
You the one that's gonna do it.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.150
What?

14:19.192 --> 14:20.986
She saw me pop her friend.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.821
You think she gonna
let me into her room,

14:22.862 --> 14:24.406
take some junk off of me?

14:24.447 --> 14:26.658
- It's got to be you.
- No, I'm not a fucking killer.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.910
Yeah, but you a dealer.

14:28.952 --> 14:32.080
You think you never gave someone
the bag that took them out?

14:32.122 --> 14:33.456
Dope fiends be chasing the high

14:33.498 --> 14:37.210
that's gonna put them under,
chasing that fire.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.920
It's gonna happen
sooner or later.

14:38.962 --> 14:41.423
We just fast-forwarding
her life a couple weeks.

14:41.464 --> 14:45.218
You need to get it into your
head that this is what's gonna
happen.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.970
You fucked up last time,

14:47.012 --> 14:49.848
and this right here,
this is your chance to make it
right.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.392
So you best be saying
"please" and "thank you."

15:13.747 --> 15:15.582
I'm looking for a party.

15:15.624 --> 15:18.960
Dude, you got the wrong girl.

15:19.002 --> 15:22.422
You do Greek?
Huh?

15:22.464 --> 15:23.840
Pay extra for Greek.

16:16.017 --> 16:16.976
Fuck yeah.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.567
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mm, mm, here you go.

16:24.609 --> 16:25.985
Thank you.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.446
Uh, and let me get a--
let me get a shot of Jack.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.365
Sure.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.033
Haven't seen you in a while.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.618
Yeah, yeah,
I've been laying low,

16:33.660 --> 16:36.746
but, you know, sometimes
I decide that cocaine smells
good.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.333
Oh, shit.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.876
Hey, girl.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.921
So we gonna
still hang later, right?

16:44.963 --> 16:46.047
Of course.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.924
All right, cool.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.801
- Okay.
- Oh.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.469
Who's that?

16:51.511 --> 16:52.971
That's my roommate's friend.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.807
She just came up from Brooklyn.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.309
I forget her name, though.
Something basic.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.645
- Karen.
- That ass, though.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.147
Who you telling?

17:02.188 --> 17:04.774
But she's coming to my place
later, so you already know.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.693
- Hey.
- Throw me another one!

17:06.735 --> 17:07.986
What you doing later?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.070
- We're going out tonight.
- Pop, pop, pop.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.071
You want to come?

17:10.113 --> 17:11.239
Uh, I'm on my way
to see Devonne.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.907
We got a thing planned.
What's this, tequila?

17:12.949 --> 17:15.368
She took your ass back?

17:15.410 --> 17:17.078
Yeah, what are you talking
about? Why wouldn't she?

17:17.120 --> 17:18.705
My number!

17:18.747 --> 17:20.081
Ah, fuck, I don't have my phone.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.374
What time is it?

17:21.416 --> 17:22.709
6:10.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.294
Shit, shit, shit.
I got to go.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.254
All right, well, peace.
Tell your girl I said hey.

17:26.296 --> 17:28.423
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
Let me get another gram.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.929
God damn it.
This shit is low rent.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.848
Wrong cords and everything.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.224
Go to Best Buy.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.059
Oh, hell, no.
I got a kid thing, man.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.186
You can't do it?

17:41.227 --> 17:43.271
I got to meet with a CI.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.485
Hey, Patty.

17:48.526 --> 17:51.654
- How you doing?
- Okay.

17:51.696 --> 17:52.906
You want to help out with a case

17:52.947 --> 17:55.950
while I chase something down?

18:25.772 --> 18:28.942
Great to see you.
See you next time, okay?

18:28.983 --> 18:31.069
- Looking forward to it, okay?
- Okay.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.571
Bye.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.365
Hey.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.116
Hey.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.451
Are you happy to see me?

18:38.493 --> 18:40.328
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.080
I want to talk to you.
Come, sit down.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.799
Good shift, huh?

18:54.384 --> 18:57.387
What's that supposed to mean?

18:57.428 --> 18:59.597
- What? Nothing.
- Mm-hmm.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.349
You being weird about this?

19:01.391 --> 19:02.475
Me? No.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.102
Okay, 'cause you can't
be weird about this.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.436
- No, I'm not being weird.
- Okay.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.899
What did you want to talk about?

19:09.941 --> 19:12.026
Have dinner with me tonight.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.653
Are we allowed to do that?

19:13.695 --> 19:15.029
"Allowed"?

19:15.071 --> 19:16.322
You know what I mean.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.992
Let's just say it's
not encouraged.

19:19.033 --> 19:21.828
But who cares, right?
It'll be fun.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.913
Yeah.

19:23.955 --> 19:27.000
Yeah, I can do that.

19:27.041 --> 19:30.044
Why don't you pick
me up at 8:00?

19:30.086 --> 19:33.339
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:40.555 --> 19:43.182
I want you to fuck
the shit out of me tonight.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.896
I can do that.

19:49.898 --> 19:50.940
See you at 8:00.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.243
Hey. Hi.

20:02.285 --> 20:03.745
You look amazing.

20:03.786 --> 20:04.913
Sorry I'm late.
My phone's dead.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.331
I hope you weren't
trying to call me.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.042
Um, I hear that they've got
really good steak here,

20:09.083 --> 20:11.210
and they--oh, they-they've got
these, uh--

20:11.252 --> 20:12.712
This, uh, lava cake thing.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.339
It's fucking awesome.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.090
Wow, it's really fucking fancy.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.641
I am such an asshole.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.893
What are you talking about?
No, you're not. You're amazing.

20:26.935 --> 20:29.062
Look at me.

20:29.103 --> 20:31.689
I put on heels.
I put on makeup.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.943
I put on makeup,
thinking about how you changed,

20:34.984 --> 20:36.611
how nice it was all gonna be,

20:36.653 --> 20:38.237
how I always knew
the day would come

20:38.279 --> 20:39.822
when you cut it all
out and fly right.

20:39.864 --> 20:42.367
And just for a second,
I even let myself be surprised

20:42.408 --> 20:44.786
that you are
completely fucked up.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.079
No, no, no, no.
I'm not fucked up.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.664
It's fine.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.415
I'm not mad, not at you.

20:49.457 --> 20:52.043
You've been telling me
for years who you are.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.586
I'm the one
who hasn't been listening.

20:53.628 --> 20:54.837
Babe, hey, I--

20:54.879 --> 20:56.923
it's-it's just that
I got a lot going on.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.008
Remember that thing about
the girl on the beach and all of
that?

20:59.050 --> 21:00.009
There was this other girl--

21:00.051 --> 21:01.511
- Just stop.
- Hey, listen.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.221
- It's serious.
- Stop!

21:05.348 --> 21:08.226
Excuse me.
Can I get the check, please?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.438
Devonne...

21:16.651 --> 21:17.777
Okay, yeah.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.543
Hey, shot of Jack, please?

21:50.727 --> 21:54.981
Look, I'm already dressed.
You're really going to--

21:55.023 --> 21:56.232
Come in.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.029
Yeah.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.991
Fine.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.743
No, you know what?

22:06.784 --> 22:08.244
Forget it.

22:08.286 --> 22:09.829
Thanks for nothing.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.624
Hey.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.377
What's going on?

22:16.419 --> 22:18.171
My mom's a cunt.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.339
She, uh, changed her mind

22:20.381 --> 22:23.885
and said she can't take
Frankie, so...

22:23.926 --> 22:25.136
Oh.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.474
You got anyone else?

22:31.267 --> 22:32.810
No.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.063
Not on a Saturday night, so...

22:37.356 --> 22:39.859
Sorry, all right?
I fucked it up.

22:42.070 --> 22:44.072
I'm sorry, Ray.

22:48.910 --> 22:52.246
Look, if you're gonna yell,
just-just yell, all right?

22:52.288 --> 22:54.874
I don't--I don't do
the silent-treatment bullshit.

22:54.916 --> 22:56.334
Huh? What?
I'm sorry.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.503
I was just looking for a plan B.

23:00.922 --> 23:03.674
And there it is.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.885
Dirty Dancing playing
in Chatham.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.264
You want to go
see Dirty Dancing?

23:10.306 --> 23:13.518
Yeah, movie in the park.

23:13.559 --> 23:14.602
We can bring food.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.232
- With Frankie?
- Yeah.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.734
Is-is that appropriate?

23:21.776 --> 23:23.111
I don't know.
I've never seen it.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.362
You've--

23:24.403 --> 23:26.906
You've never seen Dirty Dancing?

23:26.948 --> 23:27.990
- No.
- Ever?

23:28.032 --> 23:29.283
- Ever.
- Oh, my God.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.619
- What?
- Well, we have to change that.

23:32.620 --> 23:36.624
Um, baby, how do you feel
about going to see a movie

23:36.666 --> 23:37.792
with me and Uncle Ray?

23:37.834 --> 23:39.460
Is it a girl's movie?

23:39.502 --> 23:42.421
No, no, totally for boys.
It's about dirt.

23:45.591 --> 23:46.926
Okay.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.971
Jack and Diet.

23:51.597 --> 23:52.890
Oh, you're drinking again.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.934
I'm not drinking.
I'm "dranking."

23:54.976 --> 23:56.519
Okay.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.897
I'm so tired of this
lesbian fucking drama.

24:01.816 --> 24:03.109
Devonne.

24:03.151 --> 24:05.903
I got a good job.
I got my own place.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.197
Compared to some of the
raggedy-ass dykes in this town,

24:08.239 --> 24:09.448
I'm a fucking catch.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.492
I'm not gonna argue with you.

24:11.534 --> 24:12.577
I mean, I get it.
I get it.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.620
I'm not a good girlfriend.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.205
I couldn't give her
what she wanted.

24:16.247 --> 24:18.291
Could you imagine
me putting a ring on it?

24:18.332 --> 24:20.251
But that's what she
wanted, I guess.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.422
I hurt her a lot.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.346
I don't know why I do that.

24:33.598 --> 24:35.558
Are you asking me?

24:38.686 --> 24:39.812
Give me a shot.

24:51.574 --> 24:54.243
I tried to explain to her
that I had a lot on my plate,

24:54.285 --> 24:55.661
and Devonne's not having it,
you know?

24:55.703 --> 24:58.164
She's stuck on this narrative
of what I did

24:58.206 --> 25:00.791
and whose fault it is.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.171
I know what I did.

25:05.213 --> 25:06.631
I got scared,
and I pushed you away,

25:06.672 --> 25:08.341
because if I push you away
and you come back,

25:08.382 --> 25:09.800
it means that you really care.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.386
And you always come back,
but this time you didn't.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.889
I-I just went too far,
and I hurt you.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.974
And I'm sorry.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.351
And I know that it's fucked up.

25:18.392 --> 25:20.561
You don't know what it's like
to wake up every day

25:20.603 --> 25:22.647
and know that you're
a piece of shit.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.440
But I'm gonna show you.
I'm gonna change.

25:24.482 --> 25:26.359
I promise you,
I am gonna change.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.693
I'm gonna do the right thing.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.195
I'm gonna do the right thing
because I love you.

25:29.237 --> 25:30.738
I fucking love you, okay?

25:30.780 --> 25:32.573
Call me back, all right?

25:32.615 --> 25:33.783
Fuck, you can't.

25:33.824 --> 25:35.201
All right, I'll try you later.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.119
Bye.

25:41.249 --> 25:42.583
Thank you so much.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.193
Hey!
Hey!

26:09.235 --> 26:10.861
Hey!
Hello?

26:10.903 --> 26:12.071
What the fuck are you doing?

26:12.113 --> 26:13.781
Yo, chill out, bro.

26:13.823 --> 26:15.741
That's my drink,
you sloppy bitch.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.618
Oh, fuck.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.704
I'm sorry, man.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.664
- No, she did not.
- Oh, it's a drink.

26:21.706 --> 26:23.124
Hey, hey!
Don't fucking--

26:23.165 --> 26:24.292
Yeah, you better--

26:24.333 --> 26:25.543
Get off me, man.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.628
- Get that--
- Get off of me!

26:27.670 --> 26:30.089
Get off! Let me go!
Get your hands off me!

26:30.131 --> 26:32.049
- You're high, bitch.
- Get your hands off!

26:32.091 --> 26:33.634
Let me go!
Get off of me! Get off me!

26:33.676 --> 26:35.052
Fuck you!

26:37.638 --> 26:38.973
Sylvia.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.558
Yes, Mickey?

26:40.599 --> 26:41.976
They're in love.

26:43.561 --> 26:45.855
They so are.

26:45.896 --> 26:47.481
And if he doesn't answer?

26:47.523 --> 26:48.649
Oh, lover boy.

26:48.691 --> 26:50.443
This scene is perfect,

26:50.484 --> 26:55.114
except he's about
to do air guitar.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.992
Don't do it, Patrick.
Don't do it.

26:58.034 --> 27:00.119
No, don't!

27:01.412 --> 27:03.247
It was a sweet move.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.457
Yeah, okay.

27:07.501 --> 27:08.461
How's that?

27:09.962 --> 27:11.380
Oh, this?

27:13.466 --> 27:15.968
Well, it's, uh--
it's a milkshake.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.970
So it's great.

27:18.012 --> 27:20.389
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

27:22.350 --> 27:25.144
You just never eat
whatever you want?

27:25.186 --> 27:27.730
- Nope, never.
- Hmm.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.565
- Being good sucks.
- Yep.

27:29.607 --> 27:30.775
- Yeah.
- It does.

27:33.361 --> 27:35.321
Well...

27:35.363 --> 27:38.282
when you're with me...

27:38.324 --> 27:42.370
I want you to pretend
like it's Christmas morning,

27:42.411 --> 27:45.081
and you can have
whatever you want.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.669
You know what I want.

27:50.711 --> 27:52.505
Hmm?

27:58.594 --> 28:00.304
Oh, fuck, that is good.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.555
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

28:01.597 --> 28:03.349
It's good.
Mm-hmm.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.647
Frankie Jr....

28:09.688 --> 28:11.315
come finish your
nuggets, please.

28:11.357 --> 28:14.110
Aw, Mom.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.028
Hey, hey.
It's okay.

28:16.070 --> 28:18.572
He had a few already.

28:18.614 --> 28:19.907
All right.

28:24.537 --> 28:25.955
Thanks for tonight.

28:25.996 --> 28:27.039
Of course.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.895
Yo, this isn't the way.

28:49.937 --> 28:53.107
We got to go off Cape
for a minute...

28:53.149 --> 28:55.860
to New Bedford--
get us a little something

28:55.901 --> 28:57.778
to help us sleep this chick.

28:59.488 --> 29:02.408
What is it?
You-you keep looking in that
rearview.

29:02.450 --> 29:04.952
A cop's sniffing
around the garage.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.620
Want to see if they
got a tail on us.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.914
A cop? You didn't say anything
about that to Frankie.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.750
Frankie knows there's cops.
Ain't no thing.

29:11.792 --> 29:12.626
No, no, no, man.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.336
If-if cops are after us,
we got-we-we got to chill out.

29:14.378 --> 29:15.713
We can't do this right now.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.965
First off, ain't nobody
gonna know shit.

29:18.007 --> 29:20.509
She just gonna be an OD.

29:20.551 --> 29:23.137
Second off, cops hanging around
is exactly why we got to do
this.

29:23.179 --> 29:25.347
- Mm-mm. We got to lay low.
- Lay low?

29:25.389 --> 29:27.433
Man, if we went and hid
every time there was heat,

29:27.475 --> 29:28.726
we'd never get anything done.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.895
What you think,
dealing was free money?

29:30.936 --> 29:32.438
This is the job, son.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.191
- Grab onto something.
- Huh?

29:39.403 --> 29:40.946
Look behind us.

29:40.988 --> 29:43.073
Anybody else turn?

29:43.115 --> 29:45.034
No.

29:45.075 --> 29:46.911
Learned that shit
from The Godfather.

29:47.828 --> 29:49.288
Now strap your nuts on for once.

29:49.330 --> 29:51.332
You over here acting like
a bitch-made sissy,

29:51.373 --> 29:53.250
and we about to go see
some real gangsters.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.805
We going in there.
Don't say shit.

30:08.098 --> 30:10.476
These Cape Verdean
motherfuckers don't play.

30:10.518 --> 30:14.104
Shit, these are Frankie's guys
in New Bedford, aren't they?

30:14.146 --> 30:16.565
You're taking me to meet
the connect.

30:16.607 --> 30:19.527
Shut the fuck up,
or stay in the car.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.712
What up, Charmaine?

30:38.754 --> 30:40.047
Hey.

30:42.132 --> 30:44.426
Hey, O.
What you doing here?

30:44.468 --> 30:45.636
And who's the white boy?

30:45.678 --> 30:47.304
Aileen, get yo ass back inside.

30:49.932 --> 30:53.018
So who is he?

30:53.060 --> 30:55.771
Don't worry about it.
I need to see your uncle.

30:55.813 --> 30:59.316
Charmaine, let the man in.

31:05.906 --> 31:08.200
Ah, what brings
you to New Beige?

31:08.242 --> 31:09.952
Ain't time to re-up.

31:11.412 --> 31:12.746
Needed a favor.

31:14.832 --> 31:16.959
What you need?

31:17.001 --> 31:18.335
Oh, it's all good.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.755
Them girls know better
than to run they mouth.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.008
I need a taste of that pure fire
y'all fuck with.

31:24.049 --> 31:28.137
Not a whole package,
just a pure taste.

31:28.178 --> 31:30.889
You stepping out on Frankie,
looking to make a change?

31:30.931 --> 31:32.850
'Cause, you know,
we can do that.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.184
Nah, that's not it.

31:34.226 --> 31:37.813
I just need a little bit
of that stronger than strong.

31:37.855 --> 31:40.107
All right, I got you.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.990
You know, we hooked up
with up that carfentanil now--

31:48.032 --> 31:49.283
straight Chinaman shit.

31:49.325 --> 31:50.659
You ain't even gonna need a lot.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.411
Just enough to
kill a dope fiend.

31:54.538 --> 31:58.125
So what,
is it "bring a white boy to
work" day?

31:58.167 --> 32:00.836
He harder than he looks.

32:00.878 --> 32:02.296
Are you?

32:04.715 --> 32:06.175
Fuck around and find out.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.513
He said,
"Fuck around and find out."

32:11.555 --> 32:14.391
All right, then.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.601
Be careful with this.

32:15.643 --> 32:19.271
Okay, girl, you did your bit.
Go on.

32:19.313 --> 32:20.731
She right, though.

32:20.773 --> 32:23.400
Cops be dropping
just getting it on they skin.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.693
And that's cut.

32:24.735 --> 32:27.112
You shoot it pure, that's it.

32:29.406 --> 32:30.824
What I owe you?

32:30.866 --> 32:33.035
Call it a professional courtesy.

32:33.077 --> 32:34.745
You think about
what I said, though.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.288
You know,
you want to move weight

32:36.330 --> 32:38.290
with somebody
who ain't locked up,

32:38.332 --> 32:39.833
you come see me.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.420
I'll think on it.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.588
Let's go.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.057
Listen.

32:55.099 --> 32:57.142
Folks on the Cape is soft.

32:57.184 --> 32:59.061
White boys practically
shit they pants

32:59.103 --> 33:01.063
when they come to the hood.

33:01.105 --> 33:02.981
We ought to get down there
and take over.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.233
- Yeah.
- Come on, man.

33:42.813 --> 33:44.022
Hey, this is Jackie.

33:44.064 --> 33:45.149
Do your thing.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.069
Hey, this is Krista.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.741
Krista Collins.

33:53.782 --> 33:56.577
You came to see me, and...

33:56.618 --> 33:59.621
um, I don't know why,
and I don't--

33:59.663 --> 34:02.166
I don't even really
care, I just...

34:02.207 --> 34:05.169
If you want to help me...

34:05.210 --> 34:06.587
that's awesome.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.674
Help.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.427
Thanks.

34:27.608 --> 34:30.194
Jackie, what are you doing here?

34:30.235 --> 34:32.696
If I call my own number,
can I check my voice mail?

34:32.738 --> 34:33.947
- What?
- Like, if I--

34:33.989 --> 34:37.743
Can I use your phone
to call my voice mail?

34:40.996 --> 34:43.457
Do you know
your voice mail password?

34:43.499 --> 34:46.210
Uh, no.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.589
Maybe you should go home.

34:53.050 --> 34:54.718
Yeah, maybe.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.637
Maybe.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.013
My phone's dead,

34:58.055 --> 35:00.140
and I'm waiting on a phone call.

35:00.182 --> 35:03.393
I'm sure it's probably fixed
by now.

35:05.729 --> 35:07.606
Yeah, okay.

35:07.648 --> 35:09.191
Yeah, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool.

35:09.233 --> 35:11.318
I'ma head out.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.195
I think she needs a line
for the road.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.448
Road line.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.085
I got the phone.
I'm holding the phone out.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.295
I'm like, "Bitch, you think I
give a fuck about your
marriage?"

35:30.337 --> 35:31.922
And I--for real, I thought
he was gonna, like,

35:31.964 --> 35:33.090
crack my head open, right?

35:33.131 --> 35:36.260
But I don't move,
and it's high noon

35:36.301 --> 35:37.719
in fucking Bourne.

35:37.761 --> 35:40.305
And the phone is ringing,
and he just goes,

35:40.347 --> 35:42.432
"Plymouth Rock Motor Court,
room 40!"

35:42.474 --> 35:44.184
- Oh, shit.
- You broke him.

35:44.226 --> 35:45.811
- I fucking broke him!
- So-so wait.

35:45.853 --> 35:47.437
So-so-so that--
so you found her?

35:47.479 --> 35:49.147
Yeah. No.
Yeah, I mean, like...

35:49.189 --> 35:50.482
I found her hotel room

35:50.524 --> 35:51.942
and I left her a note
and I told her to call me.

35:51.984 --> 35:54.945
- Did she call?
- Well, my phone is dead.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.446
Oh, yeah.
Wait.

35:57.990 --> 35:59.366
What if we go to Bourne?

35:59.408 --> 36:01.493
How far is Bourne?
What if we go get her?

36:03.495 --> 36:05.581
We could go get her.

36:05.622 --> 36:06.999
- Rescue--
- Rescue mission!

36:07.040 --> 36:08.750
- Rescue mission.
- Rescue mission.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.752
Slade, what do you think?

36:10.794 --> 36:14.506
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

36:14.548 --> 36:15.883
Rescue mission.

36:17.301 --> 36:19.303
Rescue mission.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.971
All right, all right, fuck it.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.306
- Yes!
- Rescue mission.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.057
- Yes.
- Yeah! Call a car.

36:24.099 --> 36:25.851
Krista Collins,
we got you, girl!

36:25.893 --> 36:27.060
- That's right!
- Rescue mission!

36:27.102 --> 36:28.896
- Rescue mission!
- Rescue mission!

36:40.324 --> 36:42.659
Hey, Renee.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.412
Hey, is he, uh--oh, is he...?

36:45.454 --> 36:47.414
Oh. Oh, shit. Yeah.

36:47.456 --> 36:48.957
- Here, give him to me.
- No, no, no, no, no.

36:48.999 --> 36:51.084
Better to let him finish.
I don't want it to get
everywhere.

36:55.672 --> 36:57.674
- I'm sorry.
- It's so not your fault.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.260
It's so not your fault.

37:00.302 --> 37:01.511
I mean, it's just kid pee,
you know?

37:01.553 --> 37:03.889
Kid pee's not even that gross.

37:03.931 --> 37:04.890
Yeah.

37:04.932 --> 37:06.266
Okay, all right,
I think he's done.

37:06.308 --> 37:07.893
- I think he's done.
- Yeah, I think he's done.

37:07.935 --> 37:09.394
Pass him to me.
Come here, buddy.

37:10.437 --> 37:11.772
Oof, there we go.

37:11.813 --> 37:13.190
Okay.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.193
Um, I'm gonna hose him off,

37:16.234 --> 37:20.113
and, uh, then I'm all yours.

37:27.454 --> 37:30.248
Yeah.

37:57.442 --> 37:58.652
Oh, my God.

38:01.363 --> 38:03.240
Yes.

38:05.993 --> 38:07.035
Oh, my God.

38:14.084 --> 38:17.713
Rescue mission!
Rescue mission.

38:17.754 --> 38:18.880
I don't have underwear on.

38:18.922 --> 38:20.257
You did not just say that.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.925
- Yes.
- No, she didn't.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.302
- Yeah.
- Let me have some of that, man.

38:24.344 --> 38:25.178
- No.
- Let me have s--

38:25.220 --> 38:27.514
give me some, you little bitch.

38:27.556 --> 38:29.808
You puke in here, it's $500.

38:29.850 --> 38:31.977
No, no one's puking
in your car, bro.

38:32.019 --> 38:34.563
It would smell better if we did.

38:35.772 --> 38:37.899
Way fucking better.

38:37.941 --> 38:42.738
Um, how much farther is it?
Um, I have to pee.

38:42.779 --> 38:44.364
Not too much farther.

38:44.406 --> 38:45.907
So-so what?

38:45.949 --> 38:48.493
So you're just--you're just
gonna knock on the door?

38:48.535 --> 38:50.495
Yeah.

38:50.537 --> 38:52.622
And then what?

38:52.664 --> 38:54.458
I don't know.
I'll figure it out.

38:56.585 --> 38:58.253
Yo, you can't smoke in here.

38:58.295 --> 39:01.381
Why?
It's just a piece-of-shit
Corolla.

39:01.423 --> 39:04.134
It's a fucking Civic.
You know what? That's it.

39:04.176 --> 39:06.344
You're smoking.
You're drinking. I can't have
it.

39:06.386 --> 39:07.804
Yo, what the fuck?

39:07.846 --> 39:09.681
You and your freak-ass friends
get out of my car.

39:09.723 --> 39:11.349
Fuck you, man.
Take us to Bourne.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.643
- I said get out of my fucking
car! - I said fuck you, man!

39:13.685 --> 39:17.022
- Out!
- Hey. Stop.

39:20.233 --> 39:22.235
Fuck, man.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.279
You know what? Ugh!

39:24.321 --> 39:26.823
Suck my dick, motherfucker!

39:26.865 --> 39:31.119
Wait.
Where are we even at, anyway?

39:31.161 --> 39:34.081
Uh...I'm not really...

39:34.122 --> 39:36.333
I'm not sure.
I think we're close.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.793
- How close?
- Fuck.

39:37.834 --> 39:40.045
Uh...a few miles.

39:40.087 --> 39:43.131
A few miles? I have to pee.

39:43.173 --> 39:44.883
And the bars about
to close soon.

39:44.925 --> 39:46.176
Wait.
What time is it?

39:46.218 --> 39:48.095
Almost 1:00.

39:48.136 --> 39:51.014
Wait. When do bars close
in Massachusetts?

39:51.056 --> 39:52.599
- 2:00!
- 2:00.

39:52.641 --> 39:53.892
2:00?

39:53.934 --> 39:56.144
What kind of Puritan
bullshit is that?

39:56.186 --> 39:59.439
I know, right?
Stupid shit.

39:59.481 --> 40:00.732
What are we doing?

40:00.774 --> 40:02.776
Let's go back to--
let's go back to P-Town.

40:02.818 --> 40:05.487
- Yeah.
- I'm-I'm gonna get the car,
okay?

40:06.947 --> 40:08.490
Fuck.

40:08.532 --> 40:12.244
I don't even have service.
Let me try...over here.

40:13.328 --> 40:15.413
It's just a few...

40:15.455 --> 40:18.750
It's a few more miles.
We could walk.

40:18.792 --> 40:19.876
We could just walk.

40:22.045 --> 40:25.173
Hey, are you coming?

40:44.234 --> 40:45.735
Room 40.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.070
Knock on the door.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.865
Tell her Scotty sent you.

40:49.906 --> 40:52.492
Give her the shit.

40:52.534 --> 40:54.327
Yeah, okay.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.121
You just need to stick
around long enough

40:56.163 --> 40:57.372
to watch her shoot it.

40:57.414 --> 41:00.292
Wait. What?
W-why do I got to stick around
now?

41:00.333 --> 41:01.960
No more loose ends.

41:02.002 --> 41:04.921
If we're not 100 the bitch is
dead, something could go wrong.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.507
So you just need to make sure
she goes to sleep.

41:07.549 --> 41:10.343
Just this time,
she doesn't wake up.

41:10.385 --> 41:12.846
Nobody cries, nobody cares.

41:16.308 --> 41:17.350
You good?

41:19.102 --> 41:21.354
- I said, you good?
- Yeah, yeah.

41:21.396 --> 41:24.024
Yeah, I'm good.

41:24.065 --> 41:26.359
The fuck you waiting for?

42:05.440 --> 42:06.983
Special delivery from Scotty.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.944
You're not Scotty.

42:08.985 --> 42:11.571
Yeah, I know, but he sent me
with a present...

42:11.613 --> 42:13.573
on the house.

42:27.212 --> 42:28.588
Come on in.

42:34.344 --> 42:36.388
So what does Scotty want?

42:37.681 --> 42:39.557
I'm Scotty's supplier.

42:39.599 --> 42:42.185
He's got a new batch,
trying to get the word out.

42:42.227 --> 42:43.979
Free sample.

42:44.020 --> 42:45.563
You're full of shit.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.607
Is this full of shit?

42:49.818 --> 42:52.153
All you got to do
is shoot some right now,

42:52.195 --> 42:53.863
tell me how it is.

43:08.670 --> 43:10.880
How'd I get so lucky?

43:13.717 --> 43:14.718
I mean, you're in a hotel.

43:14.759 --> 43:18.763
It's just convenient is all.

43:18.805 --> 43:21.391
All I need to know is
what you think of it.

43:21.433 --> 43:24.019
Why don't you do it yourself?

43:25.979 --> 43:29.649
I'm clean, about 3 1/2 months.

43:29.691 --> 43:30.692
For real?

43:33.403 --> 43:35.447
I just got out of rehab myself.

43:36.906 --> 43:39.617
I thought it was gonna
stick this time, but, uh...

43:39.659 --> 43:41.286
shit's been fucked up.

43:41.328 --> 43:43.538
You have no idea.

43:43.580 --> 43:46.124
It's working for you, though?

43:48.126 --> 43:50.670
So far, so good.

43:50.712 --> 43:52.714
That's great, man.

43:54.758 --> 43:57.469
I'm gonna go back next week.
I...

43:57.510 --> 43:59.804
It's got to stick
one of these times.

44:02.098 --> 44:05.727
Yeah, you ought--
you ought to go back.

44:05.769 --> 44:07.520
I just get tired
of it, you know?

44:07.562 --> 44:10.523
Like...maybe going
to meetings every day

44:10.565 --> 44:14.319
isn't the best way
to forget you're a junkie.

44:14.361 --> 44:16.112
Yeah, but you're not supposed
to forget, right?

44:16.154 --> 44:18.406
You're supposed to process it.

44:18.448 --> 44:21.326
Get down to the causes
and conditions, you know?

44:21.368 --> 44:23.536
Yeah.

44:23.578 --> 44:26.456
Yeah, I hear you.

44:26.498 --> 44:28.708
One day at a time.

44:28.750 --> 44:32.212
One day at a time.

44:32.253 --> 44:34.714
But, like, not today.

44:34.756 --> 44:37.050
You sure?
I can get someone else.

44:37.092 --> 44:38.051
- It's--
- Fuck that.

45:59.215 --> 46:02.302
You really just gonna watch me
shoot up?

46:02.343 --> 46:04.846
Yeah, just long enough
for you to tell me how it is.

46:07.015 --> 46:10.143
You know I'm not gonna
fuck you, right?

46:10.185 --> 46:12.854
Even after I get off,
I'm not into that.

46:12.896 --> 46:14.147
Yeah.
Yeah, fine by me.

46:14.189 --> 46:17.275
Just...just try it out,
and I'll-I'll bounce.

46:17.317 --> 46:19.360
No, you know what?
Maybe-maybe you ought to leave.

46:19.402 --> 46:21.321
I-I don't want to get high
in front of a sober dude.

46:21.362 --> 46:23.323
- I'm cool.
- No, you're not cool.

46:23.364 --> 46:24.657
You're freaking me out.

46:24.699 --> 46:26.367
Why do you want to watch me?
What are you gonna do?

46:26.409 --> 46:27.494
I'm cool. Just shoot it.

46:27.535 --> 46:28.495
- Okay, we're good.
- No, you're not cool.

46:28.536 --> 46:29.496
- You know what? Just leave.
- We're good!

46:29.537 --> 46:30.497
I don't wanna do this.
No, I don't want to do this,

46:30.538 --> 46:31.498
- free taste or not!
- Okay, just relax.

46:31.539 --> 46:32.916
Just get the fuck
out, all right?

46:32.957 --> 46:34.042
- I said get out!
- Okay. Okay!

46:34.083 --> 46:35.168
- Get the fuck out!
- Okay, okay.

46:37.420 --> 46:39.005
Oh, my God.

46:39.047 --> 46:40.798
Help!

46:42.133 --> 46:43.593
Can't even give a free junk
to a junkie?

46:43.635 --> 46:45.053
Get the shot.
We got to do this the hard way.

46:45.094 --> 46:46.262
- No.
- Come on, do it.

46:46.304 --> 46:47.305
Okay.

46:47.347 --> 46:48.348
No!

46:48.389 --> 46:49.682
Come on, stick her.

46:49.724 --> 46:51.226
Push it in!

46:51.267 --> 46:52.560
No.

46:55.563 --> 46:57.398
Fuck, the needle broke.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.775
Man, let's get out
of here, please.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.109
- Wait. Osito!
- No!

47:00.151 --> 47:02.153
No.

47:02.195 --> 47:03.780
No!

47:03.821 --> 47:06.157
Osito.

47:20.755 --> 47:22.840
We...

47:22.882 --> 47:24.884
best get the fuck
up out of here.

48:24.235 --> 48:26.404
I know that shit was fucked up.

48:29.490 --> 48:31.618
I ain't gonna act
like it wasn't.

48:33.453 --> 48:36.831
But you handled
it like a soldier.

48:36.873 --> 48:39.626
But you're not a soldier,
not yet.

48:46.758 --> 48:49.636
You know, I was 15
the first time I did someone.

48:51.846 --> 48:53.431
You believe that?

48:54.641 --> 48:56.601
Barely hair on my nuts.

49:02.649 --> 49:05.193
I was riding with my brother...

49:05.234 --> 49:07.278
riding shotgun, just cruising.

49:10.323 --> 49:13.534
And my brother seen this dude
just chilling in his car.

49:15.995 --> 49:17.622
He didn't even give
me time to think.

49:17.664 --> 49:19.749
He just put the cohete
in my hand,

49:19.791 --> 49:20.917
told me to go off.

49:28.508 --> 49:31.052
I can still see everything...

49:39.727 --> 49:41.437
How his face went away.

49:46.776 --> 49:49.779
I had dreams
about that motherfucker.

49:53.199 --> 49:56.661
I couldn't tell nobody about it.

49:56.703 --> 49:59.247
Gangsters don't have nightmares.

50:08.506 --> 50:11.092
But you know what?

50:11.134 --> 50:13.928
Fuck that.

50:13.970 --> 50:16.639
Nightmares let you know
you're not a psycho.

50:19.308 --> 50:21.728
So when that dark shit come

50:21.769 --> 50:25.106
and you let it come
and you let it go...

50:25.148 --> 50:27.024
that's when you know
that you a soldier.

50:27.066 --> 50:29.026
That's when you prove
what you made of.

50:31.070 --> 50:33.030
And for a while,

50:33.072 --> 50:35.700
you're gonna wake up
every day thinking...

50:38.745 --> 50:40.163
"I'm a killer."

50:42.206 --> 50:43.583
"I'm a killer."

50:46.252 --> 50:48.087
And one day...

50:51.132 --> 50:53.718
You gonna wake up, and...

50:53.760 --> 50:56.179
you gonna think about breakfast.

50:59.223 --> 51:00.683
And life goes on.

51:03.728 --> 51:06.522
You just need to remember
what you fighting for,

51:06.564 --> 51:09.275
handle your shit.

51:12.320 --> 51:13.946
You good?

51:16.032 --> 51:18.326
Yeah, I'm good.

53:56.150 --> 53:58.152
Yeah, Abruzzo.

54:00.321 --> 54:01.739
Yeah.

54:03.449 --> 54:05.159
I know where that is.

54:56.210 --> 54:57.336
Fuck.

55:16.313 --> 55:17.815
Yes.

55:23.529 --> 55:25.865
Hey, this is Krista.

55:25.906 --> 55:28.200
Krista Collins.

55:28.242 --> 55:31.662
You came to see me,
and, um, I don't know why,

55:31.704 --> 55:33.372
and I don't--
I don't even really care.

55:33.414 --> 55:36.792
I just--if you want to help me,
that's awesome.

55:36.834 --> 55:38.252
Help.

55:42.715 --> 55:43.758
Hello.

55:43.799 --> 55:45.509
Hi.
Is Krista there?

55:45.551 --> 55:47.261
Who's this?

55:47.303 --> 55:48.804
Jackie Quinones.

55:48.846 --> 55:50.473
Jackie Quinones?

55:50.514 --> 55:51.557
Yeah, who the fuck is this?

55:51.599 --> 55:53.309
Jackie, this is Ray Abruzzo.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.518
Ray!

55:54.560 --> 55:56.437
Oh, fuck.
Ray, you found her.

55:56.479 --> 55:58.105
It's about time.
What'd she say?

55:58.147 --> 55:59.398
She see the guy?

55:59.440 --> 56:01.233
Krista Collins is dead.

56:05.905 --> 56:07.073
I'm sorry.

56:11.744 --> 56:14.080
What-what do you mean?
What...?

56:15.289 --> 56:17.625
When did she die?

56:17.666 --> 56:19.168
Maybe 1:00 a.m.

56:21.420 --> 56:23.047
Oh, fuck!

56:24.840 --> 56:26.425
Ugh.

56:26.467 --> 56:27.676
Hello?

56:31.764 --> 56:33.349
Oh, fuck.

56:33.390 --> 56:34.975
Hello?

56:38.521 --> 56:39.897
Did I lose you?
