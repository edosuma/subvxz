the same thing

17:09.462 --> 17:12.030
About shellfish
and polyester blends.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.599
Mm. Well, maybe she'll
grow out of this phase

17:14.601 --> 17:17.535
If I take her
to my prayer circle,

17:17.537 --> 17:19.637
And they all lay hands
on her.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.472
[ prays in tongues ]

17:21.474 --> 17:23.608
Of course,
that's mostly women.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.443
That could do more harm
than good.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.812
Mom! It's not a phase.
All right?
Hmm.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.515
Rhonda is who she is,

17:30.517 --> 17:33.518
And I'm not asking you to change
how you vote or how you feel!

17:33.520 --> 17:35.653
But this is your daughter.
Mnh-mnh!

17:35.655 --> 17:37.522
My sister.
Mnh-mnh!

17:37.524 --> 17:41.059
And if you can't accept her,
then I can't accept you.
Mnh-mnh.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.693
Mnh --

17:42.695 --> 17:47.498
Then I suppose I have to go
and hug my grandbabies...

17:47.500 --> 17:50.068
For the last time.
[ sighs ]

17:52.671 --> 17:54.705
But I am taking this shrimp.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.075
Gay or no gay...

17:57.077 --> 18:00.078
I'm taking this shrimp!

18:00.080 --> 18:02.847
I still don't have anything
to give mom.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.516
It's okay. I'll come visit you
at the orphanage.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.685
Happy mother's day, mommy!

18:07.687 --> 18:09.620
Oh!
From me and only me.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.490
Oh, my goodness!
Thank you, baby girl!

18:12.492 --> 18:13.658
Can I open it?

18:13.660 --> 18:18.362
[ squeals ]
oh! Macaroni picture frame?

18:18.364 --> 18:21.132
Oh! I love it!
Elbow. Your favorite.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.768
[ laughs ] and a mug?
Yes. My idea.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.169
Oh, my goodness.

A classic.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.475
Sweetheart!
[ lowered voice ]
those are my gifts.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.610
Have a little dignity, friend.
You're better than this.
Aw.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.113
It's the least I can do, mommy,

18:35.115 --> 18:36.848
Because I love you.
Aw.

18:36.850 --> 18:39.117
Jack...Forgot.
[ crying ]

18:39.119 --> 18:41.853
I did forget, mommy!

18:41.855 --> 18:43.588
Oh...

18:43.590 --> 18:45.456
All I have is to tell you
how much I love you with...

18:45.458 --> 18:47.625
[ sobs ] this hug!

18:47.627 --> 18:51.295
Oh! Jack!

18:51.297 --> 18:55.399
Listen, a hug is better
than any gift.

18:55.401 --> 18:58.336
Oh, sweetie.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.275
Well...

19:04.277 --> 19:05.643
Everybody's mad at me,

19:05.645 --> 19:07.678
And my mother is leaving,
too.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.280
Stop smiling, bow.
Okay.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.749
Look, I'm serious.
This isn't a joke, bow.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.784
She said she's never
coming back.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.420
Not christmas, not easter,
ever.

19:16.422 --> 19:19.390
Stop dancing!

19:19.392 --> 19:20.758
Really? Bow, stop dancing.

Okay.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.862
[ laughs ] oh.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.631
What?
As much as I wish
that were true,

19:26.633 --> 19:28.366
I don't think we're getting
rid of her that easy.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.567
Look.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.569
They're talking?
They're talking.

Oh, okay.
Okay?

19:37.911 --> 19:39.577
Okay.
I wonder what
they're saying.

Well, you're still
my daughter.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.664
So I tell you what.

19:59.666 --> 20:03.301
You send me an invitation,
and I'll open it.

Well, if I have
your address,

And you still live there,
I wouldn't mind it.

Weird, right?
That I should have sex
with you?

20:23.923 --> 20:25.957
I know. I know it's weird.
So weird.
