go, Peter Rabbit.

00:01.780 --> 00:03.110
Go on and run.

00:03.110 --> 00:05.700
Run for our lives.

00:05.700 --> 00:08.200
We'll tear a hole in every
fence and every wall.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.170
Peter Rabbit!

00:09.170 --> 00:10.550
Run through the fields.

00:10.550 --> 00:14.900
Run wild and free and grab
a piece of every radish

00:14.900 --> 00:16.300

00:16.300 --> 00:17.290
Peter Rabbit!

Go day and night.

00:18.780 --> 00:21.270
Go for it all.

00:21.270 --> 00:22.260

made for going slow.

Give that back,
you horrible rabbits.

01:02.710 --> 01:04.790
Peter, you said
he wouldn't see us.

01:04.790 --> 01:05.990
That's what I
always say, Lily.

01:08.950 --> 01:10.220
The tunnel.

01:10.220 --> 01:10.920
Got it.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.600
Uh, I lost them.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.970
And I was going to have
that squash for my lunch.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.250
Here we are.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.910
The perfect spot for
a nice wormy lunch.

Lovely fresh worms.

[LAUGHS]

01:43.350 --> 01:46.350
Oh, no.

01:46.350 --> 01:47.530
Oh.

01:47.530 --> 01:48.229
My lunch.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.180
Good morning.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.020
You clumsy bunny brats.

01:55.020 --> 01:55.720
Whoa.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.720
My lunch!

01:58.720 --> 02:00.750
Oh.

02:00.750 --> 02:01.450
Oh.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.040
Got you.

02:05.040 --> 02:05.740
Oh.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.340
Oh, uh, uh.

02:10.340 --> 02:12.500
You thought you could
mess up my worm patch

02:12.500 --> 02:16.270
and get away with it, did you?

02:16.270 --> 02:17.120
Uh, yes.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.300
Wait!

02:18.300 --> 02:23.079
If it was worms you wanted,
why didn't you just say so?

02:23.079 --> 02:26.230
Because you just happened to
be looking at the woods' number

02:26.230 --> 02:28.530
one worm catches.

02:28.530 --> 02:29.230
Huh?

02:29.230 --> 02:31.300
Where?

02:31.300 --> 02:33.730
Oh, you silly.

02:33.730 --> 02:37.790
I mean, big, not
at all ugly badger.

02:37.790 --> 02:41.200
Sometimes we can catch
worms in our sleep.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.650
Sometimes we catch
so many worms,

02:43.650 --> 02:46.050
we don't even know
what to do with them.

02:46.050 --> 02:47.480
Yeah, right.

02:47.480 --> 02:48.280
Worms.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.579
That's so wriggly.

02:51.579 --> 02:53.620
So you let Benjamin
go, and we'll

02:53.620 --> 02:55.450
fill this bucket with worms.

02:55.450 --> 02:57.370
Deal?

02:57.370 --> 02:58.540
I'll tell you what.

02:58.540 --> 03:03.880
Fill that bucket with worms, and
then I'll let your friend go.

03:03.880 --> 03:08.110
And be back by lunchtime when
the sun's at its highest.

03:08.110 --> 03:09.060
Or else--

03:13.220 --> 03:14.390
Look out, worms.

03:14.390 --> 03:15.400
Here we come.

Here we come?

03:21.240 --> 03:24.680
Peter, we've never caught
a worm in our lives.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.380
True.

03:25.380 --> 03:26.230
True.

03:26.230 --> 03:29.270
But well, there's a first
time for everything.

03:29.270 --> 03:32.740
But a whole bucket
load by lunch time?

03:32.740 --> 03:34.650
Benjamin's really in trouble.

03:34.650 --> 03:37.090
He's not in trouble
because we can do this.

at them too fast.

04:15.510 --> 04:16.209
Here.

04:16.209 --> 04:18.130
While we're waiting,
make yourself useful

04:18.130 --> 04:21.019

Hurry, Peter.

04:28.270 --> 04:30.390
I'm telling you, Peter.

04:30.390 --> 04:32.950
There's no such thing
as a flying worm.

04:32.950 --> 04:34.520
But I just saw one.

04:34.520 --> 04:35.220
Shhh.

Ah!

04:39.250 --> 04:40.380
Oh.

Oh.

Sorry, Mr. Fisher.

04:43.470 --> 04:45.750
That's all right,

04:45.750 --> 04:49.110
Just relieved you
weren't a giant fish.

04:49.110 --> 04:51.140
I feared I was a
goner for a moment.

worms for Tommy Brock.

04:57.570 --> 05:01.470
Well, this worm is my
last piece of bait.

05:01.470 --> 05:04.920
But you're most welcome to it.

It's a start.

05:07.050 --> 05:09.500
Yeah.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.310
Oh.

05:11.310 --> 05:12.210
I know.

05:12.210 --> 05:15.840
Your father always said
there's only one place to go

05:15.840 --> 05:17.340
if you want to find worms.

05:17.340 --> 05:18.080
He did?

05:18.080 --> 05:18.780
Where?

was right about worms

better at catching worms

06:10.320 --> 06:13.820
than you are at juggling.

They'll do it.

We're never going to do it.

06:23.830 --> 06:26.280
Uh, a good rabbit
never gives up.

06:51.310 --> 06:54.460
Stamp again.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.920
Maybe we should be birds.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.230
The stamping brings
the worms out.

06:59.230 --> 07:00.880
I knew that for a fact.

Off you go 'cause you
can't afford to fail today.

Proceed with care, think
fast, and stay aware,

and you'll succeed on
what you're trying to do.

07:23.980 --> 07:25.910

You know, it's so much to
show we were born rabbits.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.120
Yeah.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.430
We do mean some
pretty great birds.

Oh, worms?

07:58.850 --> 08:00.200

Radish stealing not
going so well today?

08:03.860 --> 08:05.600
There's for someone
else, actually.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.700
Want a shame.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.710
You'll never get
to deliver them.

08:09.710 --> 08:10.940
We've no choice.

08:10.940 --> 08:13.370
Use the worms.

Uh, no.

[LAUGHS]

08:22.880 --> 08:24.150
That got rid of him.

08:24.150 --> 08:26.720
But it got rid of
all the worms too.

08:26.720 --> 08:27.920
Poor Benjamin.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.480
We've got to do something.

08:33.549 --> 08:36.340
Maybe there's something you
might just in case for him.

08:36.340 --> 08:37.990
Just in case.

08:37.990 --> 08:45.070
Acorn, envelope, spoon,
mitten, ball of string.

this is going to--

It looks just like a worm.

08:54.850 --> 08:56.330
Exactly.

08:56.330 --> 08:57.970
We'll still do the worms.

Your friends aren't coming back.

And if I'm not going
to have my worms, then

09:26.560 --> 09:28.510
at least I can have--

I can have--

09:35.720 --> 09:38.370
Uh, of-- of-- of course.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.080
Why didn't you say?

09:40.080 --> 09:42.910
I just run to the shop and--

09:42.910 --> 09:44.960
I'm the slippers, aren't I?

09:44.960 --> 09:47.520
Anyone for worms?

09:47.520 --> 09:50.210
I-- I don't believe it.

09:50.210 --> 09:51.530
Please believe it.

09:51.530 --> 09:52.650
Give that here.

09:52.650 --> 09:53.640
No way.

09:53.640 --> 09:54.730
You let Benjamin go first.

09:54.730 --> 09:55.430
But--

09:55.430 --> 09:56.240
That was the deal.

09:59.870 --> 10:00.950
Oh, all right.

10:00.950 --> 10:02.030
All right.

10:02.030 --> 10:04.610
He'd only make one
decent slipper anyway.

10:04.610 --> 10:07.340
Now, put the bucket down
and get out of here.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.080
I like to eat alone.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.040
Lunch for one.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.180
Coming right up.

10:11.180 --> 10:14.550
See you around, Tommy Brock.

10:14.550 --> 10:17.190
Where are you fluffy little--

10:17.190 --> 10:17.900
Huh?

10:17.900 --> 10:22.250
Tommy Brock, where did
you get that bucket?

10:22.250 --> 10:25.250
Made the rabbits
collect worms for me.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.700
And you think you're clever.

10:26.700 --> 10:29.380
[LAUGHS]

10:29.380 --> 10:30.900
Oh, you nincompoop?

10:30.900 --> 10:32.400
Those aren't worms.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.840
It's string.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.580
You've been tricked.

10:35.580 --> 10:37.290
Straight guy.

10:37.290 --> 10:38.370
Nice try.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.260
But you can't fool me.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.210
Those are worms.

10:42.210 --> 10:44.880
Now, give them back.

10:44.880 --> 10:45.620
Uh-huh.

10:45.620 --> 10:48.020
Rabbits!

10:48.020 --> 10:48.970
No.

10:48.970 --> 10:52.270
I think you can spell my
lunch and get away with it.

10:52.270 --> 10:55.330
Come back here, Mr. Tod

10:55.330 --> 10:56.030
No.

10:58.860 --> 11:02.240
So you tricked the brainless
badger out of his lunch.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.740
But nothing gets in
the way of my lunch.

11:05.740 --> 11:08.380
You stole my lunch.

11:08.380 --> 11:12.510
Time to get them paws dirty, Mr.
Tod, and dig me out some worms

11:12.510 --> 11:13.210
to eat.

11:16.010 --> 11:18.820
Oh, confounded worms.

11:18.820 --> 11:20.350
This is impossible.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.380
Less chop and
more worm catching.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.080
Thank you.

11:30.870 --> 11:32.290
Hey Mr. Tod.

11:32.290 --> 11:33.870
Try acting like a bird.

11:33.870 --> 11:36.010
It really helps.

11:36.010 --> 11:38.110
[LAUGHTER]

11:39.910 --> 11:40.810
[MUSIC PLAYING]

11:40.810 --> 11:44.310
(SINGING) Peter Rabbit.

11:44.310 --> 11:45.010
Peter Rabbit.

11:52.210 --> 11:54.310
Peter Rabbit.

11:54.310 --> 11:56.410
Peter Rabbit.

11:56.410 --> 11:58.260
Peter Rabbit.
