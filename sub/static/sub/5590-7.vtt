16:53.215 --> 16:54.447
Isn't that thoughtful?

16:54.449 --> 16:57.416
Look, what jeff did
wasn't rational.

16:57.418 --> 17:00.419
You and I both know
when someone's feeling that --
no!

17:00.421 --> 17:02.120
Look, I don't think he's been
feeling that way, okay?

17:02.122 --> 17:05.056
I've been thinking
a lot about it, and he just...

17:05.058 --> 17:06.624
[ voice breaking ]
he wouldn't have left me.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.025
Layla --
just stop, okay?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.292
Look,
it doesn't matter.

17:09.294 --> 17:11.259
Whatever happened,
he's still gone.

17:13.730 --> 17:16.397
[ sighs ]

17:16.399 --> 17:18.498
Do you think that kevin
will mind if you stay tonight?

17:21.302 --> 17:23.702
Uh, that --
it won't be a problem.

17:27.607 --> 17:30.474
Want to stop anywhere
on the way home?

17:30.476 --> 17:32.642
You know what? I think
I'm just gonna stay in a hotel.

17:35.046 --> 17:36.779
I'm real sorry
about mr. Fordham.

17:36.781 --> 17:38.480
I didn't get a chance
to know him well.

17:38.482 --> 17:40.482
Were you close?

17:40.484 --> 17:42.484
<i> What is wrong with you?!</i>

17:42.486 --> 17:44.385
No, not really.

17:49.124 --> 17:51.824
I'm sorry I bought a bar
without telling you.

17:51.826 --> 17:52.825
[ scoffs ]

17:52.827 --> 17:54.226
Sprung that one on you,
huh?

17:54.228 --> 17:55.126
A little bit, yeah.

17:55.128 --> 17:56.560
[ chuckles ]

17:56.562 --> 17:59.296
We really haven't had
a chance to talk, though,

17:59.298 --> 18:00.664
Since everything.

18:00.666 --> 18:02.732
I just want to make sure
you're okay.

18:02.734 --> 18:04.300
You're grieving,
you know.

18:04.302 --> 18:05.534
But this is helping.

18:07.070 --> 18:09.336
I wish you could've seen
this place in natchez.

18:09.338 --> 18:12.639
Beverly was like
[chuckles] a star there.

18:12.641 --> 18:14.073
I want that for her<i> here.</i>

18:14.075 --> 18:15.741
Yeah, I get it.

18:16.610 --> 18:18.176
[ smooches ]

18:37.363 --> 18:40.464
I got that prescription
for you.

18:40.466 --> 18:42.466
Thanks.
Just, um...

18:42.468 --> 18:44.734
Just leave it
on the table -- again.

18:47.638 --> 18:50.605
Am I taking you to see avery
and cadence before the concert?

18:50.607 --> 18:52.773
No, just pick me up
for sound check.

18:54.943 --> 18:56.108
Okay.

18:59.313 --> 19:02.147
[ door opens ]

19:02.149 --> 19:03.148
[ door closes ]

19:03.150 --> 19:04.382
It comes with parking?

19:04.384 --> 19:06.117
Two spots
and a storage unit.

19:06.119 --> 19:08.219
How's the park
up the block?

19:08.221 --> 19:10.054
It's great -- they just
redid the playground last year

19:10.056 --> 19:12.356
And put in
one of those splash zones,

19:12.358 --> 19:13.824
Which the kids love.

19:13.826 --> 19:15.625
Yes, they do.
Don't they?

19:15.627 --> 19:16.826
[ laughs ]
[ giggles ]

19:16.828 --> 19:19.695
Gosh, you look
just like your mama.

19:19.697 --> 19:21.863
I'm sorry --
I totally recognized you

19:21.865 --> 19:23.798
Because I'm a huge
juliette barnes fan.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.698
[ sighs ]

19:24.700 --> 19:27.000
Is she meeting you here?

19:27.002 --> 19:31.003
No. No, she's, uh...
She's pretty unavailable.

19:31.005 --> 19:33.071
Right, with the concert tonight
and all.

19:33.073 --> 19:35.673
So, are you two renting this
for grandparents?

19:35.675 --> 19:37.708
'cause I can show you
an a.D.A. Unit.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.911
No, thanks. Actually,
I'm running late for
another appointment.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.913
Well, let me know
if you have any questions,

19:42.915 --> 19:45.515
And please tell your wife we'd
love to see her around here.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.983
Okay.

19:51.822 --> 19:53.988
Oh, wow.

19:53.990 --> 19:57.191
Yeah, I thought
I'd get this started for you.

19:57.193 --> 19:59.660
Did I overstep? I just thought
it'd be best if, um...

19:59.662 --> 20:01.228
Everything was back
the way it was?

20:02.731 --> 20:05.031
No, it was
really nice of you.

20:05.033 --> 20:07.700
You must've been up all night
doing this.

20:07.702 --> 20:09.368
I needed the distraction.

20:09.370 --> 20:11.469
[ clears throat ]

[ knock on door ]

20:18.409 --> 20:20.275
Hey.
Hey, rayna.

20:20.277 --> 20:21.342
Nice to see you.

20:21.344 --> 20:23.477
[ sniffles ]

20:26.748 --> 20:28.581
Well, layla, I should --
I should get going.

20:28.583 --> 20:29.615
Thank you.

20:29.617 --> 20:33.051
Tell kevin thanks
for me, too.

20:33.053 --> 20:35.253
Yeah. I will.

20:37.056 --> 20:37.687
Bye.

20:40.425 --> 20:41.590
[ sighs ]

20:41.592 --> 20:42.891
It's just awful.
I'm so sorr--

20:42.893 --> 20:44.893
No, you know, I know that
you hated jeff. You don't --

20:44.895 --> 20:45.793
Listen,
none of that matters.

20:45.795 --> 20:47.928
Only thing I care about
is you

20:47.930 --> 20:50.129
And how I can support you
through this.

20:52.133 --> 20:54.799
His family won't even
acknowledge that I exist.

20:56.302 --> 20:59.236
They won't let me
into his house.

20:59.238 --> 21:01.605
I don't have
anything of his.

21:01.607 --> 21:04.240
They won't even tell me
where he's gonna be buried.

21:04.242 --> 21:07.243
It's like I'm not even allowed
to grieve him, you know?

21:07.245 --> 21:11.212
You played such
an important role in his life.

21:11.214 --> 21:13.647
And that deserves
to be acknowledged.

21:15.417 --> 21:17.650
So, you must've been on
the bigger, higher-end tours?

21:17.652 --> 21:20.753
Yeah, I started as a runner,
and I was lucky enough

21:20.755 --> 21:22.421
To be mentored
by some great sound guys.

21:22.423 --> 21:25.056
And what they always told me
was that even in a stadium,

21:25.058 --> 21:26.490
It all comes down
to monitors and house.

21:26.492 --> 21:29.459
Yeah, well, it's gonna
be pretty much the exact
opposite on this tour --

21:29.461 --> 21:30.827
Small venues, no perks.

21:30.829 --> 21:34.163
Trust me, pre-show sushi
does not make up

21:34.165 --> 21:36.098
For what some of the stars
like to put their crews through.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.232
Oh, I toured
with juliette, too.

21:37.234 --> 21:38.800
[ chuckles ]

21:38.802 --> 21:41.836
And you don't have to worry
about me and gunnar.

21:41.838 --> 21:42.870
I mean,
we're super-chill.

21:46.141 --> 21:47.673
Oh.

21:49.276 --> 21:51.309
Okay, I-I should go.

21:51.311 --> 21:54.278
Thank you for taking the time
to meet me.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.646
It was very nice
to meet you.

22:00.919 --> 22:03.352
Just so you know,
she's not my girlfriend.
It's just casual.

22:03.354 --> 22:05.320
Oh, I don't care if it's casual
or you're planning a wedding.

22:05.322 --> 22:06.788
I care about the tour,
and if I'm gonna

22:06.790 --> 22:08.489
Be hitting the road
with somebody for 50 dates,

22:08.491 --> 22:10.491
I want to know that they're
taking it as seriously as I am.

22:10.493 --> 22:12.993
Wait -- you don't think
I'm taking all this seriously?

22:12.995 --> 22:15.028
Scarlett, this has been my dream
longer than it's been yours.

22:15.030 --> 22:16.529
I know
what an opportunity this is.

22:16.531 --> 22:17.963
If you don't want to mess it up
for both of us,

22:17.965 --> 22:19.364
You make sure you can
concentrate on the music

22:19.366 --> 22:20.365
While erin is around.

Car's here.
Let's go.

22:26.372 --> 22:27.771
Yeah, I think
I'm gonna sit this one out.

22:27.773 --> 22:29.005
I don't want
an argument.

22:29.007 --> 22:30.106
And I don't want
to watch you lie to your fans

22:30.108 --> 22:30.873
Like you did to layla.

22:30.875 --> 22:31.840
I didn't lie to her.

22:31.842 --> 22:33.107
You didn't tell her
the truth.

22:33.109 --> 22:34.875
Son, we already talked
about this.

22:34.877 --> 22:36.209
Until we know
what happened --

22:36.211 --> 22:38.544
We know<i> exactly</i> what happened!
I saw it!

22:38.546 --> 22:40.479
Yeah, after you'd had
a hell of a lot to drink!

22:40.481 --> 22:43.014
And for the record,
juliette says she wasn't there.

22:43.016 --> 22:44.332
So you're gonna take her word
over mine?

22:44.333 --> 22:45.649
Why -- why do you even want me
to go to this stupid concert

22:45.651 --> 22:47.017
If you don't believe me?

22:47.019 --> 22:48.519
'cause you're not
staying here alone.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.020
So you don't believe me
<i> and</i> you don't trust me?

22:50.022 --> 22:52.489
You getting drunk
doesn't give me much reason to!

22:52.491 --> 22:54.057
So unless you want
to lose your phone,

22:54.059 --> 22:55.691
Your driving privileges,

22:55.693 --> 22:57.359
And any chance of seeing
the outside of this
house until you're 18,

22:57.361 --> 22:58.793
Get in the damn car!

23:12.141 --> 23:13.140
Hey.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.808
Hey.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.010
I thought you were gonna be
too busy to come watch me play.

23:17.012 --> 23:19.812
I don't think
I<i> can</i> come tonight, babe.

23:19.814 --> 23:22.047
Well, that's all right.
I mean, plenty of other nights.

23:22.049 --> 23:22.914

23:24.183 --> 23:27.250
You know...

23:27.252 --> 23:30.586
I-I don't think I'm gonna
be able to go into that bar.

23:30.588 --> 23:31.987
What are you
talking about?

23:31.989 --> 23:33.488
Deacon,
you're an alcoholic,

23:33.490 --> 23:36.057
And you've been fighting
this disease your whole life.

23:36.059 --> 23:37.024
Baby, listen to me.

23:37.026 --> 23:40.093
My sister died
giving me her liver.

23:40.095 --> 23:42.862
Do you honestly think I'm ever
gonna drink another drop again?

23:42.864 --> 23:45.197
Because I am not, okay?
You know that's not
the way it works.

23:45.199 --> 23:46.398
It's one day at a time.

23:47.834 --> 23:49.500
Can't you just have
a little bit of faith in me here

23:49.502 --> 23:50.601
That I know
what I'm doing, rayna?

23:50.603 --> 23:51.868
Of course
I have faith in you.

23:51.870 --> 23:54.203
This is me doing something
to honor beverly,

23:54.205 --> 23:56.371
And right now, there's a bar
with her name on it,

23:56.373 --> 23:58.840
And it's full of people
just waiting for me
to show up and to play,

23:58.842 --> 24:01.642
So whatever we do,
I got to go right now.

24:03.946 --> 24:05.445
[ sighs ]

24:05.447 --> 24:06.879
You know what? I'm gonna start
with the red one.

24:06.881 --> 24:07.746
I'm sick of all this
depressing black.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.185
Hey. I didn't expect
to see<i> you</i> here.

24:14.187 --> 24:15.386
Yeah, luke told me

24:15.388 --> 24:17.421
That there was a tribute
before the show for jeff,

24:17.423 --> 24:20.056
So I just figured
I'd...Come for it.

24:20.058 --> 24:22.124
You know, be with other people
who feel as lost.

24:22.126 --> 24:24.025
Tell me about it.
I got to get a new manager.

24:25.395 --> 24:26.494

had a little something going on.

Are you okay?

24:34.702 --> 24:36.201
No. Um...

24:36.203 --> 24:38.303
Look, I was just wondering
if you could do me a favor

24:38.305 --> 24:40.271
And reach out
to jeff's family for me.

24:40.273 --> 24:43.207
I want to find out
if I can attend his funeral.

24:43.209 --> 24:44.975
You need me to do that?
Why?

24:44.977 --> 24:46.876
You were
his biggest client.

24:46.878 --> 24:48.143
I mean,
you're the big star.

24:48.145 --> 24:49.644
They'd have to know
who you were to him.

24:49.646 --> 24:51.379

24:51.381 --> 24:52.913
They won't acknowledge me.

do you a favor...

24:55.784 --> 24:57.316
And<i> not</i>
contact his family,

24:57.318 --> 24:58.917
Because it's not
gonna do you any good.

24:58.919 --> 25:01.619
Okay, jeff's gone,
he's not coming back,

25:01.621 --> 25:03.621
And the best way
for you to get over him

25:03.623 --> 25:05.555
Is to just pretend that
the two of you never happened.

25:07.759 --> 25:09.358
[ sighs ]

25:10.761 --> 25:12.327
What?

[ door closes ]

25:13.330 --> 25:15.296
That was great advice.

25:15.298 --> 25:17.398
That's pretty.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.133
Oh.

25:19.135 --> 25:21.335
Noel had the stylist send over
a few things for the tour.

25:21.337 --> 25:22.269
[ sighs ]

25:22.271 --> 25:23.270
What are those?

25:23.272 --> 25:25.805
An apology.

25:25.807 --> 25:29.175
For being overly sensitive
about the tour last night.

25:29.177 --> 25:32.311
You don't have to say anything
about that.
I do. I do.

25:32.313 --> 25:33.712
Because I really want
to make this work.

25:34.981 --> 25:36.847
I took a look
at both of our schedules,

25:36.849 --> 25:40.150
And if we get really creative
with my frequent flyer miles,

25:40.152 --> 25:43.086
The longest that we'll have to
go without seeing each other

25:43.088 --> 25:44.287
Is 10 days.

25:44.289 --> 25:46.322
We are gonna crush
long distance.

25:46.324 --> 25:48.691
Yeah. [ laughs ]

25:48.693 --> 25:51.760
While I'm still here, you want
to try dinner again --tonight?

25:52.696 --> 25:54.629
I would love that.
[ chuckles ]

25:54.631 --> 25:57.765
So, scarlett cut her hair
and turned into a crazy person.

25:57.767 --> 25:59.032
What?

25:59.034 --> 26:01.100
And to accuse me
of not caring about this tour?

26:01.102 --> 26:02.301
I mean...

26:02.303 --> 26:03.935
Why would she say
something like that?

26:03.937 --> 26:06.804
Well, because she thinks
that I'll get distracted

26:06.806 --> 26:08.438
If erin runs sound
for us.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.173
Erin --
your "one-night stand
