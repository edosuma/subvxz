00:15.600 --> 00:18.760
What a great vacation getaway
in the Pegasus galaxy.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.440
Where is everyone?

00:20.960 --> 00:23.680
There is smoke from the chimneys,
they're inside.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.500
Can't say I blame them.
There's nothing I hate more than a damp cold.

00:27.510 --> 00:29.000
Let's check this out.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.280
Howdy folks.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.000
Who are you?

00:52.040 --> 00:53.320
Sheppard.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.520
This is Teyla, Ronon, McKay.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.000
You from Matira?

01:01.160 --> 01:02.200
No.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.319
Over the mountains then?

01:04.560 --> 01:06.160
A little further.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.720
Then you've come a long way.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.360
You'll be in need of food and drink.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.680
Sit.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.200
Take it, you don't get
many strangers around here?

01:27.240 --> 01:28.240
No.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.320
Especially not those who travel near dark.

01:31.360 --> 01:32.960
Why's that?

01:33.840 --> 01:36.000
- You really don't know?
<i>- Callum.</i>

01:40.000 --> 01:41.400
What's your business here?

01:41.480 --> 01:44.200
No business really, we're just travellers.

01:44.240 --> 01:46.440
Then you best keep travelling.

01:47.920 --> 01:48.920
Ya...

01:55.440 --> 01:56.680
Alright then.

01:56.880 --> 01:57.920
Wait!

01:59.200 --> 02:01.800
Goran, you can't send them out there.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.920
They look like they can take care of themselves.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.240
May not even start tonight.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.200
It's been three months,

02:11.240 --> 02:13.800
how much longer do you think it will wait.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.360
Hi, what are you talking about?

02:17.200 --> 02:18.640
The Daemus.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.640
Never heard of it.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.600
It lives in the forest, it'll be feeding soon.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.040
And it is some kind of an animal?

02:28.080 --> 02:31.080
It's a creature, that has the appearance of a man.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.760
<i>But it can suck the very life from your bones.</i>

02:33.800 --> 02:36.880
<i>Leaves only a dead, withered husk behind.</i>

02:38.080 --> 02:39.880
Sounds familiar.

03:45.380 --> 03:46.420
Look,

03:46.460 --> 03:49.620
we know you're not used to
deal with strangers, but

03:49.660 --> 03:52.540
we may be able to help you
with this little problem you're having.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.180
<i>We're used to deal with this kind of thing.</i>

03:58.140 --> 03:59.820
We call them the Wraith.

03:59.900 --> 04:03.260
These are the creatures from the old stories,
from the time of the cullings.

04:03.300 --> 04:04.660
So you have heard of them.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.700
Yes, but the histories of them are incomplete.

04:06.940 --> 04:11.260
They tell of the great ships that descended from the sky,
but there's no description of the Wraith themselves.

04:11.300 --> 04:14.340
<i>Although there were a few among us who
guessed the Daemus might be one of them.</i>

04:14.380 --> 04:15.380
Why?

04:16.820 --> 04:19.060
Because it too came from the sky.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.220
<i>It was about 10 years ago.</i>

04:28.820 --> 04:31.420
<i>A bright light appeared above the village...</i>

04:33.660 --> 04:35.780
<i>and crashed in the hills.</i>

04:36.860 --> 04:38.700
<i>We didn't know what that was,</i>

04:39.420 --> 04:41.620
<i>but the people were terrified.</i>

04:41.700 --> 04:43.500
Hurry, gate in the house.

04:45.580 --> 04:48.740
<i>I went with some of the other men to investigate.</i>

04:56.300 --> 04:57.900
<i>We found the wreckage,...</i>

04:58.540 --> 05:01.380
<i>a few wounded survivors,...</i>

05:03.580 --> 05:05.620
<i>we didn't know what they were.</i>

05:07.500 --> 05:09.900
<i>We decided to take no chances.</i>

05:24.060 --> 05:25.540
<i>We slaughtered them,</i>

05:26.140 --> 05:27.340
<i>burned the bodies.</i>

05:27.380 --> 05:28.580
Wise decision.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.380
Unfortunately, we didn't get them all.

05:31.700 --> 05:35.140
And although none of us saw,
evidently one of them survived.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.300
<i>It took it's first victim, that very night.</i>

05:46.300 --> 05:48.420
<i>We tried to hunt it down,</i>

05:48.460 --> 05:50.380
we couldn't find it.

05:51.020 --> 05:53.020
It's been out there ever since.

05:53.060 --> 05:55.860
It feeds three, four times a year.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.620
<i>Takes two or three people each time.</i>

06:01.220 --> 06:04.340
Two years after the crash it took my own son.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.700
That's it.

06:12.820 --> 06:14.620
One Wraith in the forest.

06:14.660 --> 06:15.740
Yes.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.380
I'll be done by morning.

06:18.980 --> 06:22.180
We all go together. In the daylight.

06:22.540 --> 06:24.180
Are you really going to help us?

06:24.300 --> 06:27.340
Like the man said, it's just one Wraith.

06:27.350 --> 06:30.350
It'd be downright unneighbourly if we didn't.

06:30.780 --> 06:33.260
In that case, drinks are on me.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.700
Well...

06:36.710 --> 06:38.190
let's not forget the food.

06:47.060 --> 06:48.140
What?

06:48.540 --> 06:51.220
Is it true?
You're going to hunt the Daemus?

06:51.260 --> 06:52.580
It looks that way.

06:52.620 --> 06:56.020
I heard it has two heads and
it can turn you into stone, just by looking at you.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.580
Well you heard wrong.

06:57.620 --> 07:00.420
My uncle say's it'll come and
take me if I don't do my chores.

07:00.460 --> 07:01.740
He said that?

07:01.740 --> 07:05.140
Well then, if we get rid of it,
you got nothing to worry about.
You'll never have to do chores ever again!

07:05.180 --> 07:08.460
- Really?
- Yes, look, go away!

07:11.740 --> 07:12.700
What?

07:13.340 --> 07:15.500
As far as we know, no-one was taken last night.

07:15.540 --> 07:17.820
But it will strike and soon.

07:17.860 --> 07:19.980
Well, we'll kill it before that happens.

07:20.020 --> 07:22.420
You must be great at parties.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.980
We're talking about 100's square miles of forest.

07:48.020 --> 07:51.900
Be patient. Ronon's been going up against the Wraith,
one on one, for the last seven years.

07:51.940 --> 07:53.980
If anyone can track this thing, it's him.

07:54.020 --> 07:56.700
And exactly how is he gonna do that?

07:57.340 --> 07:59.340
<i>I also have good hearing!</i>

08:00.340 --> 08:01.740
Right!

08:03.420 --> 08:04.940
Carry on!

08:15.820 --> 08:18.420
What about you?
You sensing anything?

08:18.900 --> 08:20.500
I am not sure.

08:20.620 --> 08:21.900
What do you mean?

08:22.740 --> 08:24.940
There is a presence here,

08:25.020 --> 08:27.220
but it is different.

08:27.580 --> 08:29.780
I cannot quite explain it.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.620
It's in there.

08:43.860 --> 08:45.060
Ronon!

08:45.460 --> 08:46.660
Dammit!

09:28.220 --> 09:29.420
It's in there.

09:29.460 --> 09:30.460
- It was a Wraith?
- Yeah.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.740
- Did you see it?
- No.
- Well, so how do you know?

09:32.900 --> 09:35.900
Ronon is correct.
I can definitely sense it now.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.300
A female!

10:09.340 --> 10:10.540
Ellia?

10:14.140 --> 10:17.020
- Get out of the way!
<i>- Please don't shoot!</i>

10:17.460 --> 10:19.340
<i>She's not what you think!</i>

10:21.620 --> 10:23.220
She's my daughter.

10:32.860 --> 10:34.460
She means you no harm!

10:34.500 --> 10:35.700
She's a Wraith.

10:35.740 --> 10:39.060
Maybe so.
But she's different, I swear to you.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.540
Let me guess.
A Wraith with a heart of gold?

10:41.580 --> 10:43.100
<i>She doesn't feed.</i>

10:43.140 --> 10:44.980
She's never taken a human life.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.900
How is that possible?

10:46.940 --> 10:48.380
Please...

10:49.020 --> 10:52.220
lower your weapons and
I'll explain it to you.

11:00.780 --> 11:01.980
It's alright.

11:02.020 --> 11:05.940
- Father.
- I won't let them hurt you.

11:10.020 --> 11:13.180
I raised her as my own.

11:13.220 --> 11:14.820
You live here?
Together?

11:14.940 --> 11:17.060
This was part of a mine,

11:17.100 --> 11:19.020
before the last culling.

11:20.420 --> 11:22.620
It's not much to look at, I know,

11:22.630 --> 11:24.820
but we don't have much choice.

11:25.740 --> 11:27.900
The people of the village would not understand.

11:27.940 --> 11:30.140
Gee! I wonder why.

11:31.820 --> 11:34.500
<i>The villagers told us
there was a Wraith in the forest.</i>

11:34.540 --> 11:37.340
It came here in a crashed ship, ten years ago.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.140
Ten years ago?

11:39.700 --> 11:42.100
Ellia was just a child.

11:42.380 --> 11:46.620
Do you really think that she could be responsible for
the deaths that happened immediately after the crash?

11:46.660 --> 11:48.700
So you know about that, then?

11:50.220 --> 11:51.620
I was there.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.620
I helped kill the survivors.

11:56.220 --> 11:57.140
<i>But...</i>

11:57.900 --> 12:03.340
<i>when I found a young female lying unconscious,
some distance from the crash,</i>

12:08.220 --> 12:10.420
<i>I couldn't bring myself to hurt her.</i>

12:10.700 --> 12:13.900
I brought her here to this cave to

12:14.260 --> 12:16.220
hide her from the others.

12:16.500 --> 12:22.300
To this day, the people of the village don't know
and you must promise not to tell them.

12:25.020 --> 12:27.780
She's not responsible for what's been happening!

12:27.820 --> 12:29.420
Well then who is?

12:30.140 --> 12:33.340
I believe another Wraith survived the crash.

12:33.380 --> 12:34.780
<i>An adult.</i>

12:35.940 --> 12:37.980
That's who you should be looking for.

12:38.100 --> 12:41.380
If she does not feed, how does she live?

12:42.740 --> 12:44.300
<i>At first I</i>

12:44.340 --> 12:46.940
<i>fed her as you would any child and</i>

12:47.140 --> 12:49.140
<i>that seemed to suffice.</i>

12:49.940 --> 12:52.340
But then something began to change.

12:52.860 --> 12:55.500
<i>The food no longer gave her any sustenance.</i>

12:55.540 --> 12:58.700
<i>There was a hunger growing in her
that would not be satisfied.</i>

13:00.140 --> 13:04.940
I heard the stories of the other creature.
Of what it did to survive...

13:05.420 --> 13:08.820
and I was afraid that was what Ellia would become.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.060
<i>And so I...</i>

13:11.500 --> 13:13.620
<i>started to experiment.</i>

13:14.740 --> 13:18.740
I have extensive knowledge of
the chemical properties of various...

13:18.780 --> 13:21.780
medicinal plants that grow in this forest.

13:22.740 --> 13:24.860
<i>Are you interested in science?</i>

13:25.180 --> 13:28.100
I'm not sure that's what I would call this,
but yes.

13:28.220 --> 13:33.100
Ellia's hunger was growing stronger every day and
I wasn't sure that I could do anything for her.

13:33.140 --> 13:34.140
But...

13:34.540 --> 13:35.780
eventually,

13:38.620 --> 13:40.620
I came up with this.

13:50.740 --> 13:53.820
A drug that allows the Wraith
to survive without feeding?

13:53.860 --> 13:56.620
- That's what he said.
- Is such a thing even possible?

13:56.660 --> 13:59.780
We don't know enough about Wraith
physiology to say for certain.

13:59.820 --> 14:04.740
Although I must admit,
it's intriguing that this Dr Zaddik claims
that this Wraith survived on normal food for a time.

14:04.780 --> 14:05.860
Why?

14:05.900 --> 14:09.340
Well, if he's telling the truth,
it might be the answer to a very puzzling question.

14:09.380 --> 14:12.820
Right now, our best guess is that
the Wraith evolved from the Eratus Bug.

14:12.860 --> 14:15.340
Like the one that attached itself
to my neck a year ago?

14:15.380 --> 14:17.500
- That's right.
- I hate those bugs.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.140
Trust me, I know.

14:19.660 --> 14:22.020
We speculated that they evolved into the Wraith

14:22.060 --> 14:25.500
when they began to take on the characteristics
of the humans they were feeding on.

14:25.540 --> 14:28.580
Now there are many aspects of human
physiology that are quite useful.

14:28.620 --> 14:32.220
Bipedal motion, opposable thumbs,
large brain capacity.

14:32.260 --> 14:36.580
But the human digestive system
serves no purpose in the adult Wraith.

14:36.620 --> 14:38.220
So why have one at all?

14:38.340 --> 14:40.540
Because they eat normal food when they're young.

14:40.580 --> 14:44.660
Exactly. Then at some point they lose
the ability to sustain themselves with that food.

14:44.700 --> 14:48.380
So it's a teenage thing.
Pimples, rebellion, life sucking.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.260
Something like that.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.580
The question is what causes it?

14:51.620 --> 14:53.500
If it's due to some chemical deficiency like

14:53.540 --> 14:58.420
a diabetics inability to process sugar, then it's
possible it may be addressed with some kind of drug.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.500
Zaddik could be telling the truth.

15:00.540 --> 15:02.740
I'd like to go to the planet and check into it.

15:03.300 --> 15:04.300
Is that really necessary?

15:04.340 --> 15:05.380
I'm sure we could get a sample.

15:05.420 --> 15:07.020
Bring it back here for you to analyse.

15:07.060 --> 15:09.100
It's not just the drug I'm interested in.

15:09.140 --> 15:11.700
This young Wraith could be very
important for our research.

15:11.740 --> 15:12.900
What research?

15:13.300 --> 15:16.580
We're working on a retrovirus
that would alter Wraith DNA.

15:16.620 --> 15:21.900
Essentially stripping out the Eratus
Bug elements of their genetic code and
leaving only the human aspects behind.

15:22.300 --> 15:25.900
- A drug that turns Wraith into humans?
- Effectively yes!

15:25.940 --> 15:27.500
But so far we haven't had much success.

15:27.540 --> 15:31.100
Apparently, because we lack the living tissue
and blood samples we need, to test it.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.340
You think this girl would be willing to provide them?

15:34.380 --> 15:36.940
Look, I realise we can't bring
her back to Atlantis, but...

15:36.980 --> 15:40.980
I could take the retrovirus and equipment
necessary for the analysis, with me to the planet.

15:41.900 --> 15:46.300
A few days with a cooperative test subject
could be worth months of theoretical research.

15:46.900 --> 15:47.700
Elizabeth.

15:47.900 --> 15:50.380
I don't have to tell you how
important this could be for us.

15:54.260 --> 15:55.420
Is she dangerous?

15:55.460 --> 15:56.740
She's a Wraith!

15:57.500 --> 15:59.780
<i>Although, I have to admit,</i>

16:00.500 --> 16:02.340
she does seem a little different.

16:08.700 --> 16:12.700
Now remember, the leaves must
be dried and finely ground.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.300
Like this?

16:14.500 --> 16:15.900
A little more.

16:17.900 --> 16:23.500
Now why is distillation an important step?

16:25.500 --> 16:29.100
To remove the toxins from the ferrison root?

16:29.700 --> 16:31.100
Precisely.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.300
We wouldn't want the serum to send
you into paralytic shock now, would we?

16:36.100 --> 16:37.700
No father.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.900
Seriously.
Have you ever seen anything like this before?

16:44.500 --> 16:48.700
No I have not.
She's unlike any Wraith I've ever encountered.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.500
What if it's all an act?

16:53.100 --> 16:55.660
If she were a killer, why would he protect her?

16:55.700 --> 16:57.700
Maybe the act is for his benefit too.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.900
No, they live here together, Rodney.

17:00.940 --> 17:03.700
If she were like other Wraith,
he would be her first victim.

17:03.740 --> 17:05.300
<i>Teyla, this is Sheppard.</i>

17:07.500 --> 17:08.500
Go ahead.

17:09.099 --> 17:10.700
I just got back with Beckett.

17:10.740 --> 17:14.099
Ronon's gonna take him up to the cave.
I'm gonna check in with the villagers.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.859
<i>What are you gonna tell them?</i>

17:15.900 --> 17:17.500
I'm still working on that.

17:30.260 --> 17:33.660
This equipment's remarkable.
Where did you get it?

17:33.700 --> 17:38.140
Oh, here and there.
Let's start by analysing that drug of yours, shall we?

17:38.180 --> 17:39.540
Yes, of course.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.700
Would you like some tea?

17:42.700 --> 17:43.900
Thank you

17:47.300 --> 17:48.700
Oh, no thank you.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.700
- Would you like some?
- No.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.700
Are you sure, it's very good!

17:55.300 --> 17:56.300
I said no.

18:05.620 --> 18:07.740
Maybe some biscuits? I baked them myself.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.100
<i>Gate away from me!!!</i>

18:10.700 --> 18:11.300
<i>Ronon!</i>

18:37.600 --> 18:40.600
It's alright. It's OK.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.480
They hate me, don't they father?

18:43.600 --> 18:45.000
No...

18:45.800 --> 18:47.800
They just don't know you.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.800
Was that really necessary?

18:53.840 --> 18:57.400
You can dress her up and teach her table manners,
but it's not gonna change who she is.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.000
<i>Teyla, this is Sheppard. Come in.</i>

19:07.120 --> 19:08.880
Go ahead, Colonel.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.800
<i>Is Ellia still in the cave?</i>

19:10.840 --> 19:11.400
<i>Yes.</i>

19:11.440 --> 19:12.960
Has she been there the whole time?

19:13.000 --> 19:13.760
<i>Yes, why?</i>

19:13.800 --> 19:15.840
I just found another victim.

19:15.880 --> 19:20.600
<i>Apparently, he's only been missing a couple of hours,
which means she couldn't have done it.</i>

19:21.400 --> 19:24.400
Looks as though Zaddik may have
been telling the truth after all.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.000
<i>We must defend ourselves!</i>

19:32.800 --> 19:35.560
Colonel Sheppard.
Is there any progress with this hunt?

19:35.600 --> 19:36.800
We're working on it.

19:36.840 --> 19:37.760
Maybe we could help you?

19:37.800 --> 19:38.640
That won't be necessary.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.160
We're sick of doing nothing.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.000
We're sick of being afraid all the time!

19:42.040 --> 19:43.840
That thing is hunting in daylight, now!

19:43.880 --> 19:44.840
We'll never be safe.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.240
Just be patient.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.640
We'll take care of it.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.800
See?
I told you she wasn't responsible for the killings.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.800
The serum makes it unnecessary for her to feed.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.800
Can you confirm that?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.960
Not yet. It'll be a while before
I can complete my analysis.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.800
Alright. Well, in the meantime,
there's another Wraith out there.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.800
I believe Ellia may be able
to help us find it.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.200
How?

20:15.200 --> 20:16.400
May I speak with her?

20:18.800 --> 20:19.800
Alright.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.000
<i>May I join you?</i>

20:36.200 --> 20:38.040
Ellia, we need your help.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.800
You can sense the other Wraith.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.640
It is alright.

20:49.600 --> 20:53.600
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
In fact, I have the same ability.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.640
Really?

20:56.200 --> 20:58.800
I sensed you in the forest,
when you were watching us.

20:58.840 --> 21:02.000
And I knew even then that you were different.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
<i>Your father has raised you well,
he has taught you right from wrong.</i>

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
You are not like the other one.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.400
I don't let him in.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I don't like what he shows me.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.400
<i>I know,</i>

21:20.200 --> 21:23.200
but you have to try now.
We need to find him.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.800
You don't understand.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.800
I have tried myself,
but I can get nothing.

21:32.000 --> 21:32.880
Please.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.200
Alright.

21:40.000 --> 21:40.800
Good.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.400
Now concentrate.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.600
Try again.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.280
I saw a river.

22:27.800 --> 22:28.800
<i>Zaddik?</i>

22:30.600 --> 22:32.000
Is there a river nearby?

22:32.200 --> 22:33.800
Yes, just to the East.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.840
Alright, let's go. McKay, stay here and help Beckett!

22:37.880 --> 22:40.880
- Medical research, not really my thing.
- And hunting Wraith?

22:40.920 --> 22:43.640
I mean, I could stay help Beckett.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.400
Never could get into biology.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.800
This is too much information about the human body.

22:51.840 --> 22:56.760
One time, when I was an undergrad,
I diagnosed myself with half a dozen separate medical
conditions, before I had to drop the class.

22:56.800 --> 22:57.640
Really?

22:57.680 --> 23:00.520
Yeah. Believe it or not,
back then I was a bit of a hypochondriac.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.920
You know, this does require
a certain amount of concentration.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.000
What?
Am I bothering you?

23:06.800 --> 23:08.200
Maybe I'll go get some air.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.600
This must be the river
she saw in her vision.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.600
Assuming she's telling the truth.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.400
<i>Just cos there's another Wraith,
doesn't necessarily mean you can trust her.</i>

23:32.800 --> 23:34.040
What have you got?

23:34.800 --> 23:36.800
Fresh tracks.
It's him.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.200
Now do you believe?

23:39.400 --> 23:42.600
I still think there's more to this
than she and Zaddik are telling us.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.200
He's heading upstream
into the hills.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.400
Let me ask you something.

23:56.400 --> 24:01.400
If you can prove to everyone that I'm telling
the truth, that Ellia no longer needs to feed.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.000
Do you think the villagers would accept her?

24:07.200 --> 24:08.720
That's what I'm afraid of.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.240
No matter how hard we try to convince them,

24:12.280 --> 24:14.940
they'll always see her as a monster.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.600
I'm getting old, Doctor.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.560
You've got lot's of time.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.200
Never have as much as we think we have.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.600
And when I'm gone,
she'll be alone.

24:32.000 --> 24:38.600
I try to teach her about love
and human companionship,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.400
but that's exactly what she'll never have.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.800
Zaddik, there's something I want to show you.

24:51.800 --> 24:55.000
I didn't say anything at first,
because I didn't want to get your hopes up.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.800
It's a retrovirus.
Something I've been working on.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.600
I don't understand.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.400
Oh God, how am I gonna explain this?

25:08.400 --> 25:10.800
Part of Ellia is human.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.800
And part of her comes from
a creature we call the Erratus bug.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.600
It's the part that makes her look the way she does

25:17.800 --> 25:20.000
and where her desire to feed comes from.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.600
Now it's possible,
by means of this retrovirus,

25:23.640 --> 25:28.200
we can strip away those parts
and leave only the human parts behind.

25:30.200 --> 25:33.000
You mean she'd be like you and me?

25:33.600 --> 25:34.600
Yes.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.400
Now I must warn you.
The retrovirus is still experimental.

25:38.440 --> 25:43.400
In fact it's only been tested on cell cultures
in a laboratory and so far without much success.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.200
I'm hoping,

25:46.400 --> 25:50.400
that what we can learn from your daughter
will help me perfect it.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.400
We got a problem.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.800
<i>Why didn't you just radio me?</i>

25:55.840 --> 25:57.000
<i>I wanted to radio but...</i>

26:43.700 --> 26:45.300
Looks like they decided to join the hunt.

26:45.340 --> 26:46.900
If they find Ellia, they'll kill her.

26:48.100 --> 26:48.900
<i>Sheppard, this is McKay.</i>

26:49.100 --> 26:50.300
What is it, Rodney?

26:51.100 --> 26:53.740
The villagers are on the move and
it doesn't look like they're gonna a picnic.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.500
<i>Are they heading for the caves?</i>

26:55.540 --> 26:57.460
Not at the moment, no.

26:57.900 --> 26:59.500
Alright, get back there and sit tight.

27:00.900 --> 27:01.900
We're losing time, guys.

27:08.700 --> 27:09.500
<i>Ellia?</i>

27:11.700 --> 27:12.500
<i>Ellia?</i>

27:13.900 --> 27:15.100
<i>She's not here.</i>

27:16.700 --> 27:17.900
Good Lord!

27:18.220 --> 27:19.060
What?

27:19.060 --> 27:20.940
She took the retrovirus.

27:20.980 --> 27:24.780
- You said it wasn't ready.
-  It's not! Not by a long shot.

27:24.820 --> 27:25.780
What'll it do?

27:25.820 --> 27:28.740
To be honest, I have no idea.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.420
<i>Colonel Sheppard, come in.</i>

27:37.460 --> 27:38.340
Go ahead.

27:38.341 --> 27:39.740
<i> We've got another problem.</i>

27:39.780 --> 27:43.260
Ellia's gone and she's injected
herself with the retrovirus.

27:43.300 --> 27:44.860
Why would she do that?

27:44.900 --> 27:46.780
<i>She must have overheard
us talking about it.</i>

27:46.820 --> 27:49.620
I told Zaddik it might be
the key to making her human.

27:49.660 --> 27:52.260
Please. You've got to find her before the villagers do.

27:52.261 --> 27:53.900
<i>Look, Ronon says we're close.</i>

27:53.940 --> 27:56.780
If we lose the trail now, we may never catch the Wraith.

27:56.820 --> 27:58.060
<i>Rodney and I will find her.</i>

27:58.100 --> 27:59.780
<i>Alright, but be careful.</i>

27:59.820 --> 28:00.820
Understood.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.260
I'll come with you.

28:02.261 --> 28:03.700
No, I think it's best if you stay here.

28:03.701 --> 28:07.740
<i>Look, is there anywhere that she liked to go?
Any favourite hiding spots or favourite places?</i>

28:07.780 --> 28:11.420
Yes, she often goes off
for hours at a time, up into the hills.

28:11.500 --> 28:13.180
I don't like it, but she doesn't listen to me.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.900
It's a start.

28:23.060 --> 28:27.020
You know, I thought it was pretty nuts, when
Ronon was trying to track a Wraith through this forest.

28:27.060 --> 28:29.060
Now that it's just us,
do you feel any better?

28:29.100 --> 28:32.220
Oh yeah. Supremely confident.

28:39.900 --> 28:40.980
Father.

28:42.060 --> 28:43.620
<i>Ellia.</i>

28:47.620 --> 28:48.900
Where did you go?

28:48.901 --> 28:50.500
I was hiding.

28:51.260 --> 28:54.260
I didn't want the others to know.

28:54.261 --> 28:56.260
To know what?

28:57.260 --> 29:00.340
Ellia! Why did you take the retrovirus?

29:00.380 --> 29:03.500
Because I don't wanna be this way anymore!

29:04.180 --> 29:06.300
I hate what I am.

29:06.860 --> 29:11.460
You heard what Dr Beckett said.
You know the retrovirus isn't ready.

29:12.420 --> 29:14.220
I have no choice.

29:15.180 --> 29:19.100
When they kill the other Wraith,
I won't be able to pretend anymore.

29:19.140 --> 29:21.020
Pretend what?

29:22.900 --> 29:26.580
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.

29:28.780 --> 29:32.020
Your serum doesn't work, father.

29:33.020 --> 29:35.300
It never has.

29:36.660 --> 29:38.380
That's impossible.

29:39.060 --> 29:41.540
It's been two years since you...

29:43.460 --> 29:46.300
since the last time.

29:47.380 --> 29:49.420
That wasn't your fault.

29:49.460 --> 29:51.220
It was my idea.

29:51.260 --> 29:53.860
I needed time to perfect the forumla.

29:53.900 --> 29:59.860
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just got worse.

30:01.460 --> 30:03.820
What did you do?

30:07.260 --> 30:10.020
I'm sorry father.

30:11.900 --> 30:14.260
No. No, that was the other one.

30:14.300 --> 30:16.460
It was both of us.

30:17.020 --> 30:19.300
I sensed him out there.

30:19.660 --> 30:24.260
I knew when he was feeding and
I would go out at the same time.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.860
No, it can't be.

30:27.300 --> 30:27.860
Ellia!

30:27.900 --> 30:28.980
Stay away!

30:28.981 --> 30:32.020
What is it? What's happening?

30:43.820 --> 30:45.300
Let me help you.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.900
Sheppard.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.300
This is where he's been making camp.

31:10.340 --> 31:12.580
He was here less than an hour ago.

31:24.100 --> 31:25.500
You hear anything?

31:27.620 --> 31:28.940
No.

31:29.660 --> 31:31.260
Me either.

31:54.820 --> 31:58.220
Easy now. You just went to all that trouble to
save my life, it would be a shame to kill me.

32:05.820 --> 32:07.600
Are you alright, Rodney?

32:08.540 --> 32:11.820
Yeah, I'm just peachy now.
What the hell was that?

32:11.860 --> 32:14.420
The retrovirus is having the
opposite effect, than we intended.

32:14.460 --> 32:16.100
I guess so.

32:16.620 --> 32:17.780
Oh God.

32:36.940 --> 32:38.260
Ellia?

32:40.020 --> 32:41.500
You poor girl.

32:41.740 --> 32:44.180
You never deserved this.

32:45.620 --> 32:48.540
I know part of you is still there.

32:51.180 --> 32:55.540
Ellia please! This isn't you!

33:17.700 --> 33:19.060
Zaddik!

33:20.260 --> 33:21.780
Are you alright?

33:22.100 --> 33:23.500
Don't try to move.

33:23.540 --> 33:27.620
It was Ellia.
But it wasn't her fault.

33:28.060 --> 33:30.020
<i>Over here! Come on.</i>

33:30.100 --> 33:34.100
No, no, you people need to go back
to the village. It is not safe here!

33:34.500 --> 33:36.300
Who is that?

33:42.660 --> 33:45.420
Don't you remember me?

33:47.060 --> 33:50.780
No. It can't be.

33:53.140 --> 33:55.540
You were taken by the Daemus.

33:55.660 --> 33:58.420
No father.

34:00.780 --> 34:05.100
Father? I don't understand.
You're his son?

34:05.140 --> 34:08.980
If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old.

34:09.300 --> 34:11.420
Precisely.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.340
There's another one of those things out there.

34:22.380 --> 34:24.820
Look what it did to Zaddik.
I say we go after it now!

34:24.860 --> 34:27.620
No-one's going anywhere.
We'll handle this!

34:27.659 --> 34:31.139
Stay calm. How is he?

34:35.340 --> 34:38.020
I've given him something for the pain,
but his injuries are too severe.

34:38.300 --> 34:39.620
He's not gonna make it.

34:39.621 --> 34:41.300
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

34:41.699 --> 34:43.699
It's not possible.

34:44.980 --> 34:46.580
I'm sorry.

34:49.580 --> 34:53.340
Don't blame Ellia.

34:53.380 --> 34:55.580
It was my idea.

34:56.739 --> 35:00.780
<i>You have to understand.</i>

35:01.720 --> 35:09.660
When I found her, I'd just lost
my own wife and son to a fever.

35:09.661 --> 35:14.420
She was just lying there helpless.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.940
When I saw her, I knew what I had to do.

35:25.500 --> 35:34.860
As I told you, in the beginning she survived
on food and water, like any young girl.

35:38.020 --> 35:40.500
Then the hunger came.

35:45.780 --> 35:47.140
It's alright. Take what you need.

35:47.180 --> 35:48.020
I can't!

35:48.060 --> 35:49.500
Yes you can.

35:55.180 --> 36:03.340
She took what she needed from me to survive,
until I perfected the serum.

36:09.420 --> 36:13.180
Father?
Father?

36:13.620 --> 36:16.660
I'm so sorry!

36:23.320 --> 36:26.340
She never fed on anyone, after that?

36:32.560 --> 36:34.300
No!

36:39.680 --> 36:42.520
Alright! Teyla, Ronon, you're with me.
The rest of you, stay here!

36:42.560 --> 36:46.720
Colonel! The retrovirus is acting quickly.
The human part of her is almost gone.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.520
You said she killed the other
Wraith and saved McKay's life.

36:49.560 --> 36:53.560
Yes, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing.
She's operating on a purely animal level right now.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.480
Is there nothing you can do for her?

36:55.520 --> 36:59.680
I might be able to reverse the effects, if you bring
her back alive. But I doubt she'll cooperate.

36:59.681 --> 37:03.760
She's also stronger and faster
than any Wraith I've ever seen.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.320
Great!

37:12.920 --> 37:17.360
All this time. We thought you were dead.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.400
There was no other way.

37:21.760 --> 37:26.720
They never would have accepted us.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.800
And I couldn't abandon her.

37:32.160 --> 37:33.440
Why?

37:36.480 --> 37:37.520
She...

37:38.320 --> 37:40.960
needed me.

37:47.440 --> 37:48.720
<i>Colonel, this is Beckett.</i>

37:48.760 --> 37:49.680
Go ahead.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.320
<i>Zaddik's dead.</i>

37:53.160 --> 37:54.800
Understood.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.080
She knows we're here.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.580
She's watching us.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.600
Ellia?

38:20.200 --> 38:22.960
We want to help you!

38:23.000 --> 38:26.880
Dr Beckett can make you better,
but you have to come with us.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.000
We will not hurt you!

38:50.760 --> 38:53.520
She took a blow to the head when Ellia hit her.

38:56.880 --> 38:57.640
Stay with her.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.320
- Sheppard!
- That's an order!

39:23.560 --> 39:25.080
Teyla.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.680
What happened?

39:28.600 --> 39:29.360
Where's Colonel Sheppard?

39:29.400 --> 39:30.960
He went after the creature.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.440
You let him go alone?

39:32.480 --> 39:34.720
He wanted me to stay with you.

39:35.160 --> 39:37.280
I am fine. Go.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.080
Aren't we supposed to follow his orders?

39:39.120 --> 39:41.760
Sometimes, we're allowed to make exceptions.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.240
And who decides when it's one of those times?

39:45.320 --> 39:47.600
- We do!
- That's good enough.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.320
Ellia!

40:05.360 --> 40:07.720
Don't make me do this.

40:40.800 --> 40:41.920
You OK?

40:42.440 --> 40:46.600
Yeah. She tried feeding on me.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.880
She wasn't gonna let us take her back.

40:51.920 --> 40:55.280
Yeah. I know.
