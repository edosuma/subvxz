00:19.386 --> 00:22.054
I just have to say,
it's starting to piss me off.

00:22.056 --> 00:22.955
What is?

00:22.957 --> 00:24.890
How it's the same
every time.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.625
Hello, two people, wow,

00:26.627 --> 00:27.726
clearly
they should be together,

00:27.728 --> 00:28.627
but you're gonna
have to sit there

00:28.629 --> 00:31.530
watching them for two hours
while they figure that out.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.965
The end.
Nothing happens

00:32.967 --> 00:34.733
except the one thing
we knew was gonna happen.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.469
Because it's a romantic comedy,
not "Anna Karenina".

00:37.471 --> 00:39.972
Great, Mom, now you've
ruined "Anna Karenina".

00:39.974 --> 00:42.341
Carter,
there's cookie dough,

00:42.343 --> 00:44.810
Fruity Pebbles,
ooh, crushed Oreos.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.979
I can't believe
I'm begging my child

00:46.981 --> 00:48.547
to eat crushed Oreos
for dinner--

00:48.549 --> 00:49.515
I am the worst mother.

00:49.517 --> 00:50.716
Mom, you know how I feel
about Gummi Bears.

00:50.718 --> 00:54.253
I do, which is why if I always
said if we ever get separated,

00:54.255 --> 00:57.189
I'll meet you by the nearest
tub of Gummi Bears.

00:57.191 --> 01:00.259
Sadly, that is my idea
of a safety tip.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.127

01:02.129 --> 01:03.662

01:03.664 --> 01:04.663
Oh, it's Max.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.697
I thought
you two broke up.

01:05.699 --> 01:09.535
Yeah, we did, he's just...
too lazy to find someone else.

01:09.537 --> 01:13.238
So what is this,
a booty call... hmm?

01:13.240 --> 01:14.606
Mom.
Yeah?

01:14.608 --> 01:17.109
No, he's just letting me know
everyone's hanging out.

01:17.111 --> 01:21.013
And please never use the phrase
"booty call" with me ever again.

01:21.015 --> 01:23.515
Go, be with your friends.

01:23.517 --> 01:24.149
No, this is our night.

01:24.151 --> 01:27.719
Oh, we saw a movie,
we had dinner, I'm good.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.421
You sure?
Yeah.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.257
You can see me any time.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.759
Okay.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.228
Oh, wait, here, take this.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.396
Mom, I'm fine.

01:37.398 --> 01:38.397
You might get cold.

01:38.399 --> 01:42.334
Please, let me
just do one mom thing.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.735
Fine.

01:43.737 --> 01:46.305
I love you.
Love you more.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.272
Not possible.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.841
Yes, possible.

Bye.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.946
Carter, where'd you learn
to do that?

01:53.948 --> 01:55.547
Carter, what would
we do without you?

08:44.925 --> 08:46.658

08:46.660 --> 08:48.527

any other family.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.495
Is that what she told you,
the monster that stole you

08:50.497 --> 08:52.330
from us?
She wasn't a monster.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.331
She took you.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.666
She brainwashed you

08:54.668 --> 08:56.868
when you were only
three years old.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.803
Do we know
who she was?

08:58.805 --> 09:00.572
Does she look familiar?

09:00.574 --> 09:02.274
She goes by the name
Lori Stevens.

09:02.276 --> 09:05.477
Can you please stop
saying "goes by"?

09:05.479 --> 09:08.346
Oh, my God, David.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.982
Oh, my God.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.651
We know her.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.235
(silent)

09:32.872 --> 09:35.040
That's impossible,
she must be in the system.

09:35.042 --> 09:38.243

was stealing my child,

09:38.245 --> 09:40.378
I don't think so.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.413
Sounds like a cop.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.548
She is a cop--
sorry, detective.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.116

has her pictures.

09:45.118 --> 09:48.987

car rental agents.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.489

there's a reward.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.123
$10,000.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.159
Who's paying that reward,
are we paying that reward?

09:54.161 --> 09:56.528
I want this woman caught,
isn't that what you want?

09:56.530 --> 09:57.195
You know I do.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.397
And you don't care
what I want?

09:59.399 --> 10:00.799
Of course.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.201
Okay, let me
call you back.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.504
So-- my mom.

10:06.506 --> 10:07.906
She was your friend?

10:07.908 --> 10:09.841
More like
acquaintances.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.344
She did in-home
hospice care.

10:12.346 --> 10:13.645
One of them lived
on our street.

10:13.647 --> 10:17.315
She told us
her name was Janet.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.050
Why can't I remember
her last name?

10:19.052 --> 10:21.653
She said we were
such a beautiful family.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.088
I thought she was
being sweet.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.055
You know
what else she said?

10:24.057 --> 10:26.524
"It's a shame you can't spend
more time with your girls."

10:26.526 --> 10:27.859
She was monitoring
my work hours.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.327
You didn't
spend time with us?

10:29.329 --> 10:31.029
Linden, your mom
had to work.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.064
She was helping
to support the family.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.399
No, but you're right.

10:34.401 --> 10:38.003
I'm gonna do it all
differently this time,
Linden.

10:38.005 --> 10:41.172
Well, you could start
by calling me Carter.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.441
I don't know
if I can do that.

10:43.443 --> 10:46.778
You have to understand,
that name...

10:46.780 --> 10:48.680
reminds us of
the worst part of our lives.

10:48.682 --> 10:52.050
Can you understand,
I just had my entire life

10:52.052 --> 10:53.618
ripped from under me.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.554
And my name is
all I have left.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.526
If that's what you want.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.795
We'll call you Carter.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.931
Thanks, you're a peach.

11:06.933 --> 11:10.201
Oh, no.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.536
What's going on?

11:11.538 --> 11:12.570
(chatter)

11:12.572 --> 11:15.073
No-- you let this go out
on the police scanner?

11:15.075 --> 11:17.308
No, because I didn't
want this to happen.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.743
(loud chatter)

11:18.745 --> 11:20.945
Guys, please,
step aside, let 'em out.

11:20.947 --> 11:24.482
Step aside, step aside,
ma'am, ma'am, step aside.

11:26.018 --> 11:26.885
Toby, you did this?

11:26.887 --> 11:29.220
Don't worry, this is
all under control.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.222
Get out of the way.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.057
Give us some room.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.658
Get back.
Linden, Linden!

11:33.660 --> 11:35.694
Oh, my God, it is
such an honor to meet you.

11:35.696 --> 11:36.094
Namaste.

11:36.096 --> 11:39.130
Hi, I'm your dad's literary
agent, I'm Toby de Moray.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.331
Not now, Toby.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.633
(overlapping chatter)

11:41.635 --> 11:43.068
(man)
Give us some space,
please.

11:43.070 --> 11:46.705
Okay, how about
a quick photo op?

11:46.707 --> 11:49.040
(Toby)
See you later.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.243
Linden.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.245
Buddy, Joan,
please, back off,

11:54.247 --> 11:55.480
she's not ready.

11:55.482 --> 11:59.184
The hell with that.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.419
Papa.

12:07.693 --> 12:10.929
Welcome home,
baby girl.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.330
Come here, please!

12:12.332 --> 12:16.134
Oh, you remember
your Grandma Joan, huh?

12:16.136 --> 12:18.837
Oh, well, you will
as soon as you taste

12:18.839 --> 12:20.138
a bowl of
my mac and cheese.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.940
[phone rings]
I make it extra gooey

12:21.942 --> 12:22.841
just like
you always liked it.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.375
Elizabeth, would you
put that phone down?

12:24.377 --> 12:25.910
She's trying to catch
the kidnapper.

12:25.912 --> 12:29.013
All right,
all right.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.250
Hi.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.119
Hi.

12:34.121 --> 12:37.489
Uh, so Taylor and...

12:38.958 --> 12:40.658
Do I have a brother?

12:40.660 --> 12:42.794
Oh, they didn't
mention me.

12:42.796 --> 12:43.895
I couldn't be
less shocked.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.965
Grant, this has been
an emotionally chaotic day.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.601
Could you keep
the sarcasm to a minimum?

12:49.603 --> 12:51.503
So obviously,
you were born after--

12:51.505 --> 12:54.239
Yes, I'm the
replacement child.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.073
Grant.

12:55.075 --> 12:55.974
You said to a minimum.

12:55.976 --> 12:59.544
I think that
entitles me to one line.

13:02.848 --> 13:05.250
Do you remember?

13:05.252 --> 13:05.950
Not really.

13:05.952 --> 13:10.355
We used to call you
little Linden and tiny Taylor.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.990
What are we gonna
call you now?

13:11.992 --> 13:14.025
Carter.
What?

13:14.027 --> 13:16.961
I would like
to be called Carter.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.497
Oh, I don't think so--
Mom, it's decided.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.833
I have an opinion...
All right.

13:24.370 --> 13:25.003
Back door was open.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.272
I need you,
two seconds,
two seconds?

13:27.274 --> 13:28.673
I promise.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.677
So he writes books.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.779
(Joan)
He's only
had one published.

13:34.781 --> 13:38.716
Well, but Joan,
it was a bestseller.

13:38.718 --> 13:41.553
Does she know
what it's about?

13:41.555 --> 13:44.422
Uh, no?

13:44.424 --> 13:46.658
It's about you.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.593
What about me?

13:48.595 --> 13:52.363
It's called
"Losing Linden."

13:52.365 --> 13:55.300
Well, I guess
I should read it.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.602
Right after I finish
"Anna Karenina."

13:57.604 --> 14:02.273
Are you reading
"Anna Karenina"?

14:02.275 --> 14:04.709
No.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.811
David,
what a godsend.

14:06.813 --> 14:07.812
I never thought
this day would come.

14:07.814 --> 14:10.014
Me neither. You should hear
who's on my voicemail--

14:10.016 --> 14:13.785
publishers, producers,
Brad Pitt's development person.

14:13.787 --> 14:15.453
My daughter is alive.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.454
She's home.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.289
That's the day
I was referring to.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.924
Obviously-- obviously.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.626
But you are looking at
a potential huge payday.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.762
And that could resolve your
current financial crisis.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.364
Do we have to
discuss this now?

14:26.366 --> 14:27.599
We haven't even
been home for ten minutes.

14:27.601 --> 14:29.400
It's my job
to be insensitive.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.368
You have a $500,000

14:30.370 --> 14:33.471
book advance that
has to be repaid.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.439
There's always
foreclosure.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.341
I mean, you could tell
Elizabeth, which--

14:36.343 --> 14:37.842
I still haven't.
Oh, you don't have to now

14:37.844 --> 14:39.978
because your solution just
walked through that door.

14:39.980 --> 14:44.115
That's your sequel,
"Finding Linden."

14:44.117 --> 14:46.851
Carter...
Huh?

14:46.853 --> 14:48.887
That's her name now.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.321
It can't be Linden?

14:50.323 --> 14:52.290
Oh, God,
it was so simple.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.992
Okay, on the other hand,
I like the twist.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.661
You lose a child,
but you find a stranger.

14:56.663 --> 15:01.733
"Finding Carter," that works,
okay, start taking notes.

can I come in?

15:32.933 --> 15:36.968
Yeah.
Just a sec.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.504
Okay, come in.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.806
Hey.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.509
Believe it or not,
I gave this a lot of thought.

15:44.511 --> 15:48.212
Your grandmother's out there
making waffles and omelets.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.248
But I didn't even
know what you liked,

15:50.250 --> 15:52.917
and I, I don't know
if you eat breakfast.

15:52.919 --> 15:56.187
You don't seem like the...
breakfast-in-bed type.

15:56.189 --> 16:00.591
I didn't wanna subject you
to another family onslaught.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.894
Those are tough for me,
and I know these people.

16:02.896 --> 16:06.297
(chuckles)
That's fine, thank you.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.932
Great. Okay.

16:07.934 --> 16:11.970
I was thinking that maybe you
and Taylor could take the car,

16:11.972 --> 16:13.671
and she could
show you around town

16:13.673 --> 16:16.874
and maybe introduce you
to some of her friends?

16:18.243 --> 16:19.978
Or, uh,
I could just go see

16:19.980 --> 16:22.981
the ones I already have?

16:22.983 --> 16:25.183
Back where you--
Yeah.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.218
Back where
I know people.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.588
What is that,
a two-hour drive?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.123
Sure, I can drive you.

16:32.125 --> 16:35.026
I'm 16, I don't need my mommy
to take me on play dates.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.961
You don't expect me
to just give you my car.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.430
That is exactly what
you just offered a minute ago.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.399
No, I said
you and Taylor.

16:41.401 --> 16:45.003
In other words, someone has
to be in the car with me.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.108
Listen...

16:56.081 --> 16:57.749
I'm willing to do
whatever it takes

16:57.751 --> 17:00.685
to make
this relationship work.

17:00.687 --> 17:04.055
But I need to know
that you want it, too.

17:05.457 --> 17:08.993
It would help a lot if
I believed you trusted me.

17:10.496 --> 17:14.599
(tires screeching)

17:16.135 --> 17:18.036
That was a joke!

17:18.038 --> 17:19.170
Good one.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.805
I'm actually
a very safe driver.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.840
We're not worried.

17:25.611 --> 17:26.844
Well, this is
unexpected.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.646
Would you let
the daughter we do know

17:28.648 --> 17:31.282
go on a road trip
with your car?

17:31.284 --> 17:32.517
No.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.085
Hey, Kyle,
she just left.

17:34.087 --> 17:34.752
The tracker's on.

17:34.754 --> 17:38.156
She should pass Denny's
in about two minutes.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.091
Are you having her
followed?

17:40.093 --> 17:42.393
Well, like you said,
we don't know her.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.261
Well, I do know this.

17:43.263 --> 17:47.131
She probably would not
want us spying on her.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.576
The owners closed it for
the rest of the season?

17:58.578 --> 18:00.578
Not because of us.
No.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.746
No, some four-year-old

18:01.748 --> 18:05.883
found a little joint on
one of the bench thingies.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.219

19:14.521 --> 19:16.888
You like 'em?

19:16.890 --> 19:19.056
I don't know,
it's weird.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.692

a "Bourne Identity"...

19:33.239 --> 19:35.306
that's a thing.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.374
You might be
an assassin.

19:36.376 --> 19:40.444
Max, I was abducted
when I was three.

19:40.446 --> 19:43.347
So you're probably
not an assassin.

19:43.349 --> 19:46.918
No.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.419
And I have a sister.

19:48.421 --> 19:52.523
A twin sister who...
I don't remember at all.

19:52.525 --> 19:56.427
But who I feel like
I know really well.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.995

20:40.773 --> 20:45.042
is watching us in
his side view mirror.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.578
Hey.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.254
She really can
do it all, huh?

21:30.256 --> 21:31.756
Actually, I made that.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.624
I do most of
the cooking around here.

21:33.626 --> 21:37.094

Grant makes a soup.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.129
What,
we don't eat those?

21:38.131 --> 21:42.900
One had a dollar bill
floating in it, so, no.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.169
This is fantastic.
Thanks.

21:45.171 --> 21:48.039
I actually, um,
I like to bake.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.006
Yeah?

21:49.008 --> 21:50.408
I'm a big fan
of dessert.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.476

it's all I eat.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.377

Self-serve, all different
kinds of toppings.

21:58.618 --> 21:59.884
Uh-huh.
Oh, my God,
can we go?

21:59.886 --> 22:02.386
As soon as you're done.
I'm done.

22:02.388 --> 22:03.821
I'll just tell my mom,

22:03.823 --> 22:06.991
uh, our mom... Mom.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.560
It's fine,
you can have her.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.395
Hey.
You're back.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.397
According to the FBI,
this is where I live now.

22:13.399 --> 22:16.300
Was it fun to see
your friends?

22:16.302 --> 22:18.202
Yeah, loads of fun.

22:18.204 --> 22:20.204
Even made a new one.

22:20.206 --> 22:21.405
Guy in a silver Subaru

22:21.407 --> 22:24.308
who sat in his car
all day watching me.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.443
Oh, my God.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.478
I hope you got
his license.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.313
As a matter of fact,

22:29.315 --> 22:31.449
I did.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.250
You can find him,
right?

22:33.252 --> 22:34.885
Or, uh...

22:34.887 --> 22:36.987
maybe you already
know who he is.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.289
How would I possibly?

22:38.291 --> 22:40.124
Well, you were nervous.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.059
I took your car.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.961
Maybe you
had me followed?

22:43.963 --> 22:47.365
No, she--
she would never.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.467
Would you?
Of course not.

22:49.469 --> 22:54.071
You said that you needed me
to trust you and I did-- I do.

22:55.907 --> 22:58.042
Okay, well, uh...

22:58.044 --> 22:59.744
Let me know
if you find anything.

22:59.746 --> 23:02.279
Absolutely,
I'll look into this.

23:02.281 --> 23:04.548
Carter wants yogurt.

23:04.550 --> 23:08.686
Great.
Go, have fun.

23:11.523 --> 23:13.357
(door opening)

23:13.359 --> 23:15.025
I know.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.061

23:22.567 --> 23:26.203
Hey, yo,
try some Fro-Yo.

23:32.010 --> 23:35.179
Do you know
what you want?

23:35.181 --> 23:36.747
Um, yeah, yeah, I do.

23:36.749 --> 23:40.584
I'll meet you inside.
Okay.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.354
Excuse me, hi.

23:43.356 --> 23:44.054
Um...

23:44.056 --> 23:47.425
who do I talk to about
getting a job here?

23:47.427 --> 23:48.826
That'd be me.

23:48.828 --> 23:51.429
Listen, Zubin.

23:51.431 --> 23:52.630
You want me
to work here.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.800
Trust me, it is
the opportunity
of a lifetime.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.334
Really?
Um-hmm.

23:57.336 --> 23:58.369
What's so great
about you?

23:58.371 --> 24:01.739
I want it to be a surprise when
I show up for work tomorrow.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.374
2:00 sound good?

24:03.376 --> 24:04.041
I guess?

24:04.043 --> 24:07.945
I'll, uh,
I'll see you then, Zubin.

24:09.347 --> 24:12.049
This is my friend Gabe.

24:12.051 --> 24:15.085
This is Carter,
my long lost sister.

24:15.087 --> 24:15.920
Hi.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.856
So welcome home,
I guess.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.324
Yeah, thanks.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.793
It's been kind of
an abrupt transition.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.262
She didn't know until yesterday
that she'd been kidnapped,

24:25.264 --> 24:27.565
and she doesn't
remember any of us.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.166
Holy crap,
you must be

24:29.168 --> 24:31.569
majorly freaked out.

24:31.571 --> 24:34.138
Yeah, to be honest,
I'm trying not to think about

24:34.140 --> 24:36.707
how freaked out I am.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.478
Hey, there's a party.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.314
Would it help
to go to a party?

24:43.316 --> 24:43.814
Yeah.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.150
Party pretty much
solves anything.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.018
At least for
a couple hours, right?

24:48.020 --> 24:51.822
I don't know, I've...
never been to one.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.824
You've never been
to a party?

24:53.826 --> 24:56.961
Not that didn't
have a goody bag.

24:56.963 --> 24:57.728

26:40.433 --> 26:42.266
Well, you're happy
she's back, right?

26:42.268 --> 26:43.968
Yeah, of course
I'm happy.

I don't know how happy
she is, though.

probably tell--

because you can't
keep your eyes off her--

26:54.580 --> 26:56.780
my sister was having

29:13.152 --> 29:15.352
Yeah, we're friends

29:15.354 --> 29:17.221

Hi, Mrs. Wilson.

29:30.836 --> 29:31.635
Mr. Wilson.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.570

what time it is?

29:33.572 --> 29:34.471

29:34.473 --> 29:36.306

It's okay,
she's just drunk.

29:39.245 --> 29:42.346
(Carter)
And she may have had
a pot brownie or two.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.348

Oh, Tay-Tay, sweetie,

29:44.350 --> 29:46.517
let me get you inside,
come on.

29:46.519 --> 29:48.752
Oh, can you stand up?

29:48.754 --> 29:50.587
I'll get her inside.

29:50.589 --> 29:51.655

30:06.705 --> 30:08.105
Me too.

30:08.107 --> 30:11.275
And I'd like
to do it again.

30:13.511 --> 30:16.713
We'll see.

30:16.715 --> 30:18.882
Is she still
standing there?

30:18.884 --> 30:19.917
Yup.

30:19.919 --> 30:23.353
Ugh.
(car starting)

30:23.355 --> 30:26.790
Obviously, I'm happy
for you two to get along.

30:26.792 --> 30:28.225
But I'd prefer if
you didn't pass on

30:28.227 --> 30:30.394
your bad habits
to Taylor.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.196
My bad habits?

30:32.198 --> 30:37.267
So there are already things
about me that you don't like?

30:37.269 --> 30:38.602
What are they?

30:38.604 --> 30:39.570
What I meant to say
was that--

30:39.572 --> 30:42.406
Just name one or,
I don't know,

30:42.408 --> 30:46.443
you could name something
about me that you do like.

30:47.145 --> 30:50.380
Name anything that
you know about me at all.

30:52.217 --> 30:53.851
I am trying
to get to know you,

30:53.853 --> 30:57.154
but you're doing everything
you can to avoid me!

31:00.225 --> 31:02.693
That's because
you're stiff,

31:02.695 --> 31:06.096
you're humorless,
you're a control freak.

31:06.098 --> 31:10.167
You operate from
this place of fear.

31:13.738 --> 31:15.305
You know...

31:15.307 --> 31:19.610
My mom used to tell me
every day that she loved me.

31:21.145 --> 31:24.481
And I haven't
heard you say it once.

31:24.483 --> 31:28.652
Not to any member
of your family.

31:32.490 --> 31:35.225
(door opening/closing)

31:39.998 --> 31:42.299
(exhaling)

31:43.601 --> 31:45.702
Please tell me
you didn't hear that.

31:45.704 --> 31:46.770
I hear everything.

31:46.772 --> 31:50.641
That's one advantage to people
not remembering you exist.

31:50.643 --> 31:52.809
So I'm not wrong?

31:52.811 --> 31:57.014
That woman has
the personality
of a refrigerator.

32:01.519 --> 32:04.054
She's not the Hallmark
commercial, for sure,

32:04.056 --> 32:05.956
but it's because of us.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.024
What did we do?

32:07.026 --> 32:09.359
Nothing on purpose.
You were kidnapped,

32:09.361 --> 32:11.528
I was born
ten weeks premature.

32:11.530 --> 32:12.663
What?

32:12.665 --> 32:15.332
Yeah. I was,
like, this big.

32:15.334 --> 32:18.302
Doctor said ten-to-one
I wouldn't make it.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.437
Mom--
Elizabeth, please,

32:20.439 --> 32:24.274
I am... not
on board with "mom."

32:24.276 --> 32:26.677
She kind of cracked.

32:26.679 --> 32:27.945
All she wanted
was to hold a baby,

32:27.947 --> 32:30.113
but instead it looked like
she was about to have

32:30.115 --> 32:31.248
another dead kid
on her hands--

32:31.250 --> 32:35.752
which, sorry,
everyone thought
you were.

32:35.754 --> 32:40.190
Yeah, that--
that would be rough.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.259
But I think it'll help

32:42.261 --> 32:44.294
having you back...

32:44.296 --> 32:46.096
maybe.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.832
I would not
hold my breath.

32:48.834 --> 32:49.900
I know.

32:49.902 --> 32:52.869
Although, I can hold my breath
for a really long time.

say it like that.

don't worry.

40:32.264 --> 40:35.899
You were right,
Lori Stevens was here.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.534
She risked her life

40:37.536 --> 40:41.104

for five seconds.

40:41.106 --> 40:45.208
