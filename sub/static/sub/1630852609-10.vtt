WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.170
This is not RuPaul's
Best Friend Race.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.705
I feel very attacked!

00:04.705 --> 00:07.741
If you don't have star quality,
get the fuck outta here.

00:07.741 --> 00:10.477
Oh, my God.

00:10.477 --> 00:14.281
RuPaul: This is Untucked,
backstage at the competition

00:14.281 --> 00:18.285
to become America's
next drag superstar.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.187
Girl, if you're not watching
Untucked,

00:20.187 --> 00:22.689
you're only getting
half the story.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.030
RuPaul: Thank you, ladies.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.333
This concludes
our investigation.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.203
While you untuck backstage,

00:36.203 --> 00:39.072
the judges and I
will deliberate.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.981
Oh, my God,
this was the one challenge

00:47.981 --> 00:50.250
that I prayed
I would get through,

00:50.250 --> 00:54.087
and the fact that
I could possibly win this

00:54.087 --> 00:57.557
is a monumental moment
in itself.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.693
Yay-ya!

00:59.693 --> 01:01.895
Oh, my fucking God.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.363
Not only does it feel like

01:03.363 --> 01:06.366
I didn't have
a successful moment,

01:06.366 --> 01:08.969
but I disappointed Ru,

01:08.969 --> 01:13.774
and it's kind of embarrassing
to feel like it was that bad.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.208
It's disheartening.

01:15.208 --> 01:18.145
I am shook.

01:18.145 --> 01:19.579
Am I asleep?

01:19.579 --> 01:21.915
Is this just, like,
a really bad nightmare

01:21.915 --> 01:23.750
because I've been
so stressed out?

01:23.750 --> 01:26.753
Like, anything is possible.

01:26.753 --> 01:30.157
You just don't know
at this point.

01:30.157 --> 01:32.392
Untucked cameras
to the werkroom.

01:32.392 --> 01:35.963
Sending the queens
in three, two, one.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.698
Ooh, girl.

01:37.698 --> 01:41.802
I have a feeling this is gonna
be a so-fizz-ticated Untucked,

01:41.802 --> 01:42.903
if you know what I mean.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.604
-Look at this.
-Well, well, well.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.206
This looks so fun.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.741
Gorgeous.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.377
-Cheers.
-Yes!

01:50.377 --> 01:51.845
Let's get sipsy!

01:51.845 --> 01:53.880
-Yes!
-Yes!

01:53.880 --> 01:57.751
Thanks, Bubly Sparkling Water!

01:57.751 --> 02:00.520
I did not expect that.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.989
Not amused, darling,
not amused.

02:01.989 --> 02:03.023
Not amused at all.

02:03.023 --> 02:06.293
Ugh! Normally
I love a good spanking.

02:06.293 --> 02:10.097
Well, shout-out to Miss Thing,
who emerges unscathed.

02:10.097 --> 02:12.165
-Bitch!
-DeJa!

02:12.165 --> 02:13.967
To the only good one.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.669
Yes, she survived!

02:15.669 --> 02:18.939
Finally!

02:18.939 --> 02:22.909
I think we all saw that coming,
because you fucking killed it.

02:22.909 --> 02:25.412
You killed Lil Jon.
You were sexy as hell.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.914
Thank you.

02:27.914 --> 02:30.650
Going into this, me and Daya,
kind of the same page.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.919
We were dreading Snatch Game.

02:32.919 --> 02:36.356
Like, this was the one challenge
in years past

02:36.356 --> 02:37.624
that when I auditioned
I was, like,

02:37.624 --> 02:40.227
this is the challenge
that I'm gonna go home in.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.863
And I not only got past,
I got complete praise,

02:42.863 --> 02:44.431
and I can't fucking believe it,

02:44.431 --> 02:46.333
and I should have
never worn those shoes.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.601
But other than that--

02:47.601 --> 02:50.871
I got completely shredded
down to the bone.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.773
Oh, we're going straight
to Jasmine. Okay.

02:52.773 --> 02:53.974
I mean, if--I mean--

02:53.974 --> 02:55.242
-Your time's over, bitch.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,

02:55.242 --> 02:56.810
So fuck my drag.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.779
No, if you wanna finish
your sentence, go ahead.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.614
Oh, my God.
And, like, I very much--

03:00.614 --> 03:02.115
like, I do wanna get
to all of you guys,

03:02.115 --> 03:04.518
but I'm very much--
I really have to kind of be

03:04.518 --> 03:05.786
slightly selfish in this moment.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.220
-Bitch, be selfish!
-It's your moment!

03:07.220 --> 03:08.255
Yeah!

03:08.255 --> 03:11.558
It feels like
complete validation.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.126
Again, winning
isn't everything, but--

03:13.126 --> 03:14.428
-It is here.
-Yes it is, girl.

03:14.428 --> 03:17.364
It feels pretty damn
fucking good, you know?

03:17.364 --> 03:18.365
But thank you guys so much,
honestly.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.433
Yes, bitch.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.534
Enough about me.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.835
DeJa, you're gonna win

03:21.835 --> 03:23.670
and the rest of us are gonna
fucking go home today.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.138
[laughs]

03:25.138 --> 03:26.973
Don't fucking put that
in the universe.

03:26.973 --> 03:29.643
I don't think it's just gonna
two people lip syncing today.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.678
-I do slightly kind of agree.
-Oh, God.

03:31.678 --> 03:34.581
I feel like it would either
be all eight of us--

03:34.581 --> 03:36.216
No, not you.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.451
Or I think, like, at least--

03:37.451 --> 03:39.586
-You'll be the only safe one.
-Well, not you.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.122
Yeah, just be you
in the back, like...

03:42.122 --> 03:44.091
No, bitch, I'm--
gimme some money,

03:44.091 --> 03:45.225
so I can throw it on you ho's!

03:45.225 --> 03:46.860
She's in the back,
like, "Yay-ya!"

03:46.860 --> 03:49.129
Who the fuck knows,
seriously?

03:49.129 --> 03:50.997
I've been trying to figure out

03:50.997 --> 03:52.866
what went wrong
with my Snatch Game,

03:52.866 --> 03:54.835
because I felt really confident
in it, going into it.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.337
Dove said it perfectly.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.439
I just felt like energetically,

03:59.439 --> 04:01.174
I could feel your
insecurity about it,

04:01.174 --> 04:03.710
and I could feel you
looking to Ru

04:03.710 --> 04:06.012
for the approval of your jokes.

04:06.012 --> 04:10.217
The hardest part of Snatch Game
was the volleying,

04:10.217 --> 04:12.152
and I feel like out
of everyone, Lady Camden,

04:12.152 --> 04:13.487
you did that the best.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.955
Yeah, you did a great job.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.090
In my mind, I sort of
thought of, like, you know,

04:17.090 --> 04:18.792
the queens in the past
who volley back and forth.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.228
And then as I was doing it
and as I kind of heard silence,

04:21.228 --> 04:24.064
I just sort of thought,
oh, is this normal?

04:24.064 --> 04:26.266
It did feel a little weird,

04:26.266 --> 04:29.069
like, kind of when to do it,
you know?

04:29.069 --> 04:30.504
Like, it's different
when you see them, like,

04:30.504 --> 04:32.439
you know, we're watching it
from at home.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.740
But actually being on the set,

04:33.740 --> 04:36.309
you almost, like, don't
wanna step on Ru's toes

04:36.309 --> 04:39.212
if she's talking, or you feel
like you gotta wait.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.381
I don't know.
It's a mind fuck.

04:41.381 --> 04:43.183
It's, like,
a weird middle ground

04:43.183 --> 04:44.217
that you're trying
to figure out.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.352
What I took away from it

04:45.352 --> 04:47.254
is that, like, the rules
that were set there

04:47.254 --> 04:50.690
were there to guide us,
but if you are funny,

04:50.690 --> 04:53.827
they don't give a fuck
if you broke the rules.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.095
They did seem to think
that, like,

04:55.095 --> 04:57.397
all of you are quick enough
and smart enough

04:57.397 --> 05:00.033
to be able to do something,

05:00.033 --> 05:02.035
and you didn't find
the right vehicle,

05:02.035 --> 05:05.939
"rules be damned" is kind of
how I interpreted it.

05:05.939 --> 05:09.442
This was just a hard week
for us mentally anyway.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.278
Like, we were all
stressed the fuck out

05:11.278 --> 05:15.415
because of Snatch Game
being such a huge challenge.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.918
I think we all just
got really...

05:17.918 --> 05:19.553
-In our heads.
-...comboozled.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.954
You know what I'm saying?

05:20.954 --> 05:22.322
Kombucha'd.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.191
If they do pull something

05:24.191 --> 05:25.959
where we're all gonna
have to fucking lip sync,

05:25.959 --> 05:27.327
stay the fuck away from me,

05:27.327 --> 05:29.129
because I don't know how
the hell I'm gonna move.

05:29.129 --> 05:32.566
What about you, Miss Jorgie?

05:32.566 --> 05:33.767
I know I'm in the bottom,

05:33.767 --> 05:35.869
so I'm just very content
about everything.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.205
I'm at peace
with everything and--

05:38.205 --> 05:40.607
They get two weeks of us, girl.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.609
Honestly, I'm really,
like, eh.

05:42.609 --> 05:45.178
I'm really tired.
I'm fucking tired.

05:45.178 --> 05:49.549
And, like, I feel like I
keep on trying, trying, trying.

05:49.549 --> 05:50.984
It's never enough.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.019
Like, these acting challenges,
oh, my God, the death of me.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.922
The fucking death of me,
and... [sighs]

05:57.624 --> 06:00.493
But you're not giving up, right?

06:00.493 --> 06:02.762
No, of course not.
I'm just tired.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.798
-Okay.
-Ugh, like...

06:04.798 --> 06:07.701
-Hi, Jorgeous!
-Hi, Jorgeous!

06:07.701 --> 06:09.236
We all are so proud of you.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.705
I remember when we used to
watch these shows together

06:11.705 --> 06:13.673
when you were young,
and I told you

06:13.673 --> 06:15.141
you were gonna be there,
and you're there.

06:15.141 --> 06:18.378
All your family and friends
love you so much.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.181
Keep being you,
beautiful and amazing.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.716
Love you, mijo, miss you.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.417
Have fun living your dream.

06:24.417 --> 06:25.852
Hi, Jorgeous.

06:25.852 --> 06:29.055
I just wanna say
that I'm so proud of you.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.490
I remember when
we started this journey

06:30.490 --> 06:32.392
when you were 14 years old,

06:32.392 --> 06:34.027
and look at where you're at now.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.930
I'm honestly so lucky
I have a gay older brother

06:36.930 --> 06:39.165
who paved the way for me,
you know.

06:39.165 --> 06:42.736
He used to go to the clubs
in our hometown

06:42.736 --> 06:44.838
and record, like, the queens
that would perform.

06:44.838 --> 06:48.441
And, girl, there was so many
great dancing divas,

06:48.441 --> 06:50.810
and I was like,
"That's what I wanna be."

06:50.810 --> 06:53.647
I just wanna make 'em proud,
I really do.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.283
I cannot wait for the world
to see your talent.

06:56.283 --> 06:57.951
I love you very much.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.986
Hi, superstar.

06:59.986 --> 07:01.221
Happy and proud of you.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.189
Grandma loves you
mucho, mucho. Mwah.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.592
Work hard
and achieve your dreams, bro.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.960
I love you, Jorgie.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.262
Growing up, I always knew
you were gonna be something big.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.997
Hi, Jorgie.
I'm very proud of you.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.767
I love you very much,
and keep reaching for the stars.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.669
Get it, Jorgeous!

07:15.669 --> 07:18.438
All: Bring home the crown!

07:18.438 --> 07:22.108
[sobs]

07:34.888 --> 07:38.024
I miss them so much!

07:38.024 --> 07:43.229
I miss them so much, and, like,
not being able to talk to them.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.364
Like, they're all my rock.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.800
And like... [sobs]

07:46.800 --> 07:50.303
I'm battling all these things
about myself, and...

07:56.710 --> 08:02.716
I wanna do it for them so bad,
but it's so hard.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.485
You know they're
so proud of you, though.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.486
You know what I mean?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.288
Like, no matter how well
you do in this,

08:08.288 --> 08:09.456
whether you go home today

08:09.456 --> 08:10.824
or whether you win this shit,

08:10.824 --> 08:14.094
like, overall,
they're so fucking proud of you.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.396
-And they're proud of you now.
-Do you know what I mean?

08:16.396 --> 08:18.498
They won't "be" proud of you,
they're proud of you right now.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.533
Yeah, girl, just fuck,
you made it here.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.469
They're so proud of you.

08:22.469 --> 08:25.271
This is such a special moment
for Jorgeous.

08:25.271 --> 08:29.976
I can feel that she needs this
little boost from her family,

08:29.976 --> 08:33.446
and to see all of them
sitting there,

08:33.446 --> 08:35.715
you can tell that
she is their little superstar,

08:35.715 --> 08:39.719
and to see that support for her
is just really beautiful.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.521
And she needs this right now.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.456
She needs a little bit of love,

08:43.456 --> 08:46.092
a little bit of oomph
from her family.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.794
I'm so grateful for them.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.397
I wouldn't be here without
their love and support,

08:50.397 --> 08:55.301
because, girl, it was a lot
to get here, it really was.

08:55.301 --> 08:57.971
And... [sighs]

08:57.971 --> 08:59.139
You can, like, see that, like,

08:59.139 --> 09:00.940
your dad, like, really
loves you, like, a lot.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.409
-You know?
-And your grandma.

09:02.409 --> 09:06.079
Your cute, awesome grandma?
Oh, my God.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.680
If I go home today,
I'm gonna be so disappointed,

09:07.680 --> 09:10.483
because I shouldn't be acting
like this, you know, and, like--

09:10.483 --> 09:11.651
You as a person,
I think you just need

09:11.651 --> 09:13.286
to give yourself
some more credit right now.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.287
-I agree.
-You know what I mean?

09:14.287 --> 09:16.322
Like, this is fucking hard.

09:16.322 --> 09:17.891
Everyone's got bullshit
going on in their head.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.993
If they say that there isn't,
they're lying, you know?

09:19.993 --> 09:22.495
Myself included.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.631
I just wanna say thank you
to each and every one of y'all.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.733
Like, y'all have been there
for me,

09:26.733 --> 09:28.168
like, ever since this started.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.969
I'm not gonna lie. I thought
coming into this competition

09:29.969 --> 09:32.405
there was gonna be
some fucking bitches here.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.807
Like, I was so fucking worried.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.443
-Well, we are bitches.
-Yes, y'all are, but--

09:36.443 --> 09:39.512
But y'all have been so amazing.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.314
I love you all.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.249
-You said your brother was gay?
-Yes.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.485
Okay, great.
[all laugh]

09:45.485 --> 09:47.587
Yes, bitch!

09:47.587 --> 09:49.055
So fine!

09:49.055 --> 09:50.723
Oh, my God!

09:50.723 --> 09:52.625
Honestly, drag queens
in the past

09:52.625 --> 09:56.896
have always tried to, like,
flirt with my brother.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.832
Like, girl, drag queens
love my brother,

09:58.832 --> 10:00.233
and he loves the attention.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.534
He loves it.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.269
I'm coming to Nashville.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.637
Oh, my God, y'all are nasty.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.372
I was wondering who that was,
but you had--

10:06.372 --> 10:08.942
I was like, I don't wanna
be that bitch that--

10:08.942 --> 10:10.710
Nice change of mood,
Bosco, bitch,

10:10.710 --> 10:12.278
because in a minute I thought
we was gonna be like

10:12.278 --> 10:13.913
how we was
in the super-tease, bitch.

10:13.913 --> 10:16.115
[fake wailing]

10:16.115 --> 10:21.321
No, we are some lusty,
horny bitches. [laughs]

10:21.321 --> 10:23.056
Can we talk about Raven, though,

10:23.056 --> 10:25.158
how she looked
in the Snatch Game?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.259
Bitch, beautiful.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.795
Oh, no, she was
absolutely gorgeous, yeah.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.331
She was the funniest person on
that fucking panel, I'm sorry.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.866
Other than you, bitch.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.133
No, she was the funniest.

10:34.133 --> 10:39.005
Now, Raven, what is your secret
to looking so fabulous?

10:39.005 --> 10:41.274
Six hours
and a lot of duct tape.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.543
[all laugh]

10:43.543 --> 10:47.480
Here's the thing.
Bitch, I had fun.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.148
Raise your hand
if you had fun.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.683
-Mm.
-Eh.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.519
You had fun?
Did you have fun?

10:52.519 --> 10:55.054
Like, I feel, like,
bitch, I had fun.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.257
That's why I think
it's, like, so weird,

10:57.257 --> 10:59.926
because there's been challenges
I felt, like, nervous doing,

10:59.926 --> 11:01.494
and in this one, I'm having fun,

11:01.494 --> 11:02.962
and they're like,
"You did awful."

11:02.962 --> 11:05.098
I'm like, well, damn, bitch.

11:05.098 --> 11:08.201
Honestly, I love the judges'
critiques and getting feedback,

11:08.201 --> 11:09.836
but I just wanna know,
like, what you all think,

11:09.836 --> 11:12.805
because we've, like, bonded,
and we, like, know, like,

11:12.805 --> 11:15.542
what's happening in the brain
behind the wheels.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.609
And we were there in real-time.

11:16.609 --> 11:17.877
So it's like
we all give each other

11:17.877 --> 11:19.512
little glances
a lot of the time.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.481
It's like, what the hell
is going on?

11:21.481 --> 11:23.116
It just makes it more fun.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.084
That's what I did literally
right after Snatch Game.

11:25.084 --> 11:26.219
I went to Bosco, I was like,

11:26.219 --> 11:27.186
"I need you to be blunt
and honest with me.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.354
Tell me how I did."

11:28.354 --> 11:30.823
Sometimes I'm delusional.
Y'all know this.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.859
I need somebody
who would, like, check me.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.661
And she was very honest with me.

11:34.661 --> 11:37.697
I would have been on sky-high
thinking I was good.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.065
[all laugh]

11:39.065 --> 11:40.600
That's easier said
than done, bitch.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.335
You're like,
"Oh, be a character."

11:42.335 --> 11:44.337
Because I feel like
Bosco's choice

11:44.337 --> 11:47.740
was Gwyneth as a character.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.409
And they're like oh, no.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.711
We just kind of
wanted more Gwyneth.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.880
And it was like, oh, well...

11:53.880 --> 11:56.249
Like, I planned the literal
shit out of it,

11:56.249 --> 11:58.051
but you either, like, strike oil

11:58.051 --> 11:59.886
or like, lightning strikes
or it doesn't.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.355
And there's not, like,
a formula to break it down.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.690
No.

12:03.690 --> 12:06.926
I'm just happy that I
at least got into Snatch Game.

12:06.926 --> 12:10.063
That was my goal, so...

12:10.063 --> 12:11.164
Betsy DeVos.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.232
Betsy DeVos.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.401
I kind of feel bad,
because I fucking hate her,

12:15.401 --> 12:18.137
and I didn't wanna do her any
justice, you know what I mean?

12:18.137 --> 12:19.272
You didn't.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.708
[all laugh]

12:21.708 --> 12:23.509
Reading is important.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.446
Don't worry about that, girl.
You're fine.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.680
You beat me to it, DeJa.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.483
I fucking love y'all
so fucking much.

12:30.483 --> 12:31.851
I feel like I cursed us

12:31.851 --> 12:34.387
because there was one time
we were on the couch,

12:34.387 --> 12:35.888
after the soap opera,

12:35.888 --> 12:37.323
and then we were all just
like, "We're so amazing."

12:37.323 --> 12:38.791
And I was like, "Just you watch.

12:38.791 --> 12:41.194
There's gonna be one challenge
where we all fail."

12:41.194 --> 12:42.829
[all laugh]

12:42.829 --> 12:46.633
It's kind of insane
to hear RuPaul say yet again

12:46.633 --> 12:49.135
how freaking good we all are.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.437
There's gonna be one challenge
we're all gonna bomb.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.939
Yeah.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.042
You all go home.
[all laugh]

12:56.042 --> 12:58.344
It's your fault!

12:58.344 --> 12:59.412
Thanks, Willow.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.614
Sorry, everybody.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.751
[screaming]

13:06.586 --> 13:09.389
♪ Oh, my God ♪

13:09.389 --> 13:13.126
Dove Cameron
is, like, the sweetest,

13:13.126 --> 13:16.763
most genuine, beautiful,
ethereal goddess.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.098
Hi, you guys!

13:19.098 --> 13:20.433
-Hi!
-Hey!

13:20.433 --> 13:22.535
I want so badly to come up
and, like, touch you all.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.870
I'm very sad.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.104
Vicariously through air.

13:25.104 --> 13:26.172
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, I can feel it.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.273
This ensemble
is just stunning.

13:27.273 --> 13:28.708
-Like, stunning.
-Oh, my God.

13:28.708 --> 13:32.111
This is, like, my dream, that
I can be this close to you guys.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.680
We're glad you're
this close to us.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.548
[all laugh]

13:35.548 --> 13:38.151
You guys are such a fucking
phenomenal group of queens.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.952
Thank you.

13:39.952 --> 13:42.121
Yeah. How is everybody feeling?

13:42.121 --> 13:44.724
I mean, not the best,

13:44.724 --> 13:47.827
but I think there's kind of
a calmness right now,

13:47.827 --> 13:50.129
because we have no idea
what the fuck is going on.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.330
You know what I mean?

13:51.330 --> 13:52.732
Yes, I know that feeling,
when you're like,

13:52.732 --> 13:53.733
well, fuck it,
it's over now.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.468
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.769
I'm already,
like, in the mindset

13:56.769 --> 13:57.904
that I am gonna be
in the bottom again,

13:57.904 --> 13:58.971
which I'm fine with,

13:58.971 --> 14:00.306
because
I'm a really good lip syncer,

14:00.306 --> 14:01.607
and I can't wait to show you.

14:01.607 --> 14:04.210
Ooh, she said "I'm a really good
fucking lip syncer,

14:04.210 --> 14:05.845
and I'm not afraid."

14:05.845 --> 14:07.113
She did say she was delusional
earlier, though.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.948
Yes, I did say I was delusional,
so that, too, yeah.

14:08.948 --> 14:11.517
You know what, though?
That's a fucking blessing.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.687
Like, delusion is my go-to.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.689
It helps.
It keeps you in this bubble

14:16.689 --> 14:18.491
where, like, you just don't know
what's going on,

14:18.491 --> 14:20.026
and it makes you feel
a lot better about yourself.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.794
Well, actually, you know what?

14:21.794 --> 14:25.264
I got this tattoo recently that
says, "None of this is real."

14:25.264 --> 14:26.332
-Yes.
-I love it.

14:26.332 --> 14:27.967
Because that's the thing, right?

14:27.967 --> 14:30.303
Like, how much of life
is what we make it,

14:30.303 --> 14:33.039
and how much of it is,
like, an agreed-upon reality.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.209
An element of delusion is
kind of always to your benefit,

14:36.209 --> 14:37.577
where you can really be, like,

14:37.577 --> 14:40.046
actually, I'm gonna rewrite
this narrative for myself.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.581
None of this is real.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.949
Like, obviously, it's difficult

14:42.949 --> 14:45.451
when there is, like,
an actual line of human beings

14:45.451 --> 14:47.320
being like, no,
this is what happened.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.288
You fucked up.

14:49.288 --> 14:50.590
[all laugh]

14:50.590 --> 14:53.092
It's like, you're kind of
like, all right, well...

14:53.092 --> 14:54.327
But also, at the end of the day,

14:54.327 --> 14:56.028
like, it is really only
your opinion that matters

14:56.028 --> 14:58.698
when it comes to
then what you do next.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.801
An element of delusion is
kind of always to your benefit,

15:01.801 --> 15:03.569
where you can really be like,

15:03.569 --> 15:05.905
actually, I'm gonna rewrite
this narrative for myself,

15:05.905 --> 15:07.507
and what I do next

15:07.507 --> 15:10.009
can either be coming
from a place of defeat

15:10.009 --> 15:13.212
or I can completely
shift this around.

15:13.212 --> 15:16.883
This is such an expression
of your truth and your humanity.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.552
I think that, like, everything
about you as a human being

15:19.552 --> 15:20.620
goes into your drag,

15:20.620 --> 15:23.556
goes into your performance.

15:23.556 --> 15:24.657
You guys blow me away.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.293
Truly, I'm, like, bowled over.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.662
You have such wisdom.
Oh, my gosh.

15:29.662 --> 15:30.730
You do.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.198
Even though
you're young as fuck,

15:32.198 --> 15:33.299
you have a wisdom about you.

15:33.299 --> 15:34.333
-You better werk it.
-Thank you.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.334
You guys are beautiful.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.903
Like, I could actually cry.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.504
I won't.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.273
[all laugh]

15:40.273 --> 15:43.442
Because my makeup artist
isn't here today, so...

15:43.442 --> 15:45.678
But, yeah, you guys
are so stunning,

15:45.678 --> 15:48.614
and I just think this is such
a pressure-cooker environment.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.484
And as performers, like,
if you're not feeling vulnerable

15:51.484 --> 15:53.452
and you're not failing
sometimes,

15:53.452 --> 15:54.754
then you're not really
putting yourself out there.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.189
So I think that
this is actually a win,

15:56.189 --> 15:57.423
even if it doesn't feel like it.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.760
I'm sorry, it's time
to go back to main stage.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.295
I really, really love you!

16:02.295 --> 16:04.397
We love you!
Energy hug!

16:04.397 --> 16:06.899
Yeah, everybody, let's put
an energy hug in the center.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.168
Ahh!
Mwah!

16:09.168 --> 16:10.670
-I wanna be her.
-Oh, my God.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.071
She's, like,
the cutest little thing.

16:12.071 --> 16:14.140
It's nice to hear someone
come in here

16:14.140 --> 16:15.908
and just to give you
that reassurance.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.009
We all fail.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.778
It's what you do
with the failure.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.346
And, like, we forget that,
because like she said,

16:20.346 --> 16:22.181
it's a fucking pressure cooker.

16:22.181 --> 16:23.516
Well, whatever comes next,

16:23.516 --> 16:25.351
we know that we're
walking into it together.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.552
Yes.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.054
DeJa's just laughing at us.

16:28.054 --> 16:30.890
DeJa's like, "I don't understand
why y'all are so down!"

16:30.890 --> 16:32.758
[all laugh]

16:32.758 --> 16:34.360
Cheer up, buttercup!

16:34.360 --> 16:37.797
I was speaking for the room.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.799
You were?

16:39.799 --> 16:41.300
Do it in your Betsy.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.603
[imitating Betsy DeVos]
You were?

16:45.605 --> 16:47.506
Well, it didn't work last time.
Don't do it now.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.876
Aah, you stupid bitch!

16:49.876 --> 16:52.612
Ladies, ladies,
five minutes.

16:52.612 --> 16:53.613
Five minutes.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.248
-Okay.
-Yes.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.549
Imma get this retied
on my body.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.317
Yeah, let's get off
this couch.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.625
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.227
It may be, like,
a three-person lip sync.

17:08.227 --> 17:10.730
And, you know, my track record
ain't been good,

17:10.730 --> 17:14.634
so I need to show the judges
I deserve to stay.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.869
I'm feeling so scared
right now.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.904
I really wanna stay here.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.106
I feel like
I have a lot to prove.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.207
I need to do it for my family,

17:21.207 --> 17:22.975
who's rooting for me
back at home.

17:22.975 --> 17:26.979
My batteries are recharged now,
and I'm ready, bitch.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.347
All right, ladies.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.917
Time for main stage.
Come on out.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.151
Okay. Let's do it.

17:32.151 --> 17:33.586
Let's do this, yo!

17:33.586 --> 17:35.488
Ugh!

17:35.488 --> 17:37.590
RuPaul:
Welcome back, ladies.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.026
I've made some decisions.

17:40.026 --> 17:43.496
DeJa Skye, con-drag-ulations.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.798
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.

17:45.798 --> 17:49.335
The rest of you
snatched our attention,

17:49.335 --> 17:53.005
but for all the wrong reasons.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.707
Jasmine.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.043
Angeria.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.711
Willow.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.513
Daya.

18:00.513 --> 18:01.514
Jorgeous.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.050
Lady Camden.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.651
Bosco.

18:05.651 --> 18:08.821
You are all up for elimination.

18:08.821 --> 18:12.158
Next week,
you are cordially invited

18:12.158 --> 18:16.662
to a Lip Sync
Lollapa-Ru-Za smackdown

18:16.662 --> 18:22.401
to determine which one of you
will sashay away.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.838
Oh, my God.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.441
This is insane.

18:28.441 --> 18:32.178
It feels like we are all
marching off to meet our maker.

18:32.178 --> 18:36.549
I think we're all collectively
shitting our pants right now.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.384
Are we gonna be doing this
in pairs?

18:38.384 --> 18:40.252
Are we gonna be doing solos?

18:40.252 --> 18:42.021
Who are we gonna be
lip syncing against?

18:42.021 --> 18:43.556
Because that
changes everything.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.625
I'm terrified right now.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.661
I don't wanna have to lip sync,

18:48.661 --> 18:51.831
because that's why
I went home the first week.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.300
We don't know anything
about Lollapa-Ru-Za.

18:54.300 --> 18:58.104
All we know is we're basically
all up for elimination.
