I feel the spirit of the lord

-Amen!

02:33.254 --> 02:37.823
Now, today, we honor
a true servant of god.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.725
A young woman
who has committed herself

02:39.827 --> 02:43.462
to the service of people
here at bethel.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.898
Everything from preaching
in my absence,

02:46.000 --> 02:50.769
to organizing ministries.
She is your assistant pastor.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.771
[chuckles] but she's my baby.

02:54.275 --> 02:57.376
I'm so proud to announce
that olivia will be leaving us

02:57.478 --> 03:01.413
to pastor her very own church
in greenwood, texas!

03:01.515 --> 03:04.082
Won't he do it?

03:04.185 --> 03:05.450
I said, won't he do it?

03:22.403 --> 03:23.936
My own church?
When were you gonna tell me?

03:24.038 --> 03:27.472
Sweetheart, we've been talking
about this for years.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.575
I'm not ready, mom, there's
still so much I have to learn--

03:29.677 --> 03:31.543
livi, livi, stop, stop.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.312
God has prepared you for this.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.682
Your father and I have given you
everything that you need.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.117
Trust and believe in you.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.419
I'm not sure if I can.

03:40.521 --> 03:43.322
Then trust in god.

03:43.424 --> 03:47.259
And believe in your mama,
I got your back.

03:47.361 --> 03:52.431
Listen, listen, it's a small
church in a small town.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.968
God has given you the gift
of leadership and service.

03:56.070 --> 03:58.270
Go serve the king.

03:58.372 --> 04:01.173
Besides, that's in your blood.

04:01.275 --> 04:06.278
Going all the way back
to your great-great-grandfather.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.150
Okay.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.356
What's the name of the church?

04:17.458 --> 04:20.092
-You ready?
-No.

04:20.194 --> 04:22.160
[chuckles]

04:22.263 --> 04:25.230
genesis baptist church.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.533
-New beginnings.
-Mm-hmm.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.968
I like that.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.571
Wait, how did you even find out
about the position?

04:32.673 --> 04:35.974
Miss corrine, a friend of mine
from my spelman days.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.909
She and I got to chatting
about a few things,

04:38.012 --> 04:40.279
and one thing lead to another.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.348
And here we are.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.618
Okay. When do I leave?

04:46.720 --> 04:49.388
-Two days.
-Two days?

04:49.490 --> 04:51.290
I'm gonna miss christmas!

04:52.893 --> 04:54.426
I know.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.967
Daddy, how am I supposed
to pack up my entire life

05:02.069 --> 05:03.802
in two days?

05:03.904 --> 05:07.105
Just take what you need,
and we'll send the rest later.

05:12.146 --> 05:15.447
Livi, talk to me, sweetheart.

05:15.549 --> 05:18.483
-What's going on?
-I'm so used to assisting mom.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.852
Not actually being her.

05:22.156 --> 05:27.859
Hm, that's the thing,
you are not her, you're you.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.463
And this church
will love you for you.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.399
-[door shuts]
-who's hungry?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.802
I bought someone's favorite.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.738
I know that smell a mile away.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.340
Yes! Thank you!

05:41.442 --> 05:42.941
Livi...

05:43.043 --> 05:47.179
I have something
very special just for you.

05:47.281 --> 05:49.715
The family bible.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.118
This bible has been passed down

05:53.220 --> 05:57.322
to each pastor in our family
for generations.

05:59.426 --> 06:02.227
Your grandpa wesley
gave me this bible

06:02.329 --> 06:04.162
when I first started
preaching and singing,

06:04.264 --> 06:07.399
and now I'm giving it to you.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.001
The next singing-pastor in line!

06:10.104 --> 06:12.070
Can we just stick to pastor?

06:12.172 --> 06:14.840
Livi, stop denying your roots.

06:14.942 --> 06:17.743
You can't let one moment
stronghold you

06:17.845 --> 06:18.744
for the rest of your life.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.679
It was a very traumatic moment,
mom.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.748
Then go tell it, livi.

06:22.850 --> 06:26.351
Let it set you free.

06:26.453 --> 06:29.020
But you are a singing pastor.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.125
[olivia] "let your faith be
bigger than your fears."

06:33.227 --> 06:35.594
ah, hebrews 13:6.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.996
Actually, mom,
I think the scripture reads,

06:38.098 --> 06:41.333
"the lord is my helper,
I will not be afraid."

06:42.269 --> 06:44.936
it's the essence
of the scripture.

06:45.038 --> 06:50.275
See, you were born to lead.

06:50.377 --> 06:53.412
Always remember that.
And sing.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.647
-Mom.
-Unh-uh. Mm-mm.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.582
Bring it in, come on.

06:57.684 --> 07:01.019
Bring it in, hug your mama.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.389
-I love you.
-I love you more, baby girl.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.792

08:13.894 --> 08:16.561
I'm gonna run these

08:16.663 --> 08:18.163
It was a pleasure meeting you.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.233
You, too.

08:33.814 --> 08:36.615
Pastor richard!

08:36.717 --> 08:37.916
Welcome to genesis!

08:38.018 --> 08:39.551
-Hello, you must be--
-dorothea deeds.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.786
But everybody calls me miss dee.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.389
Let me be the first to welcome
you to greenwood, texas.

08:44.491 --> 08:48.260
We're small, but mighty!

08:49.630 --> 08:51.496
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Uh-hmm.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.131
The decorations are fantastic!

08:53.233 --> 08:55.233
That just warms my heart,
pastor.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.801
-You did this?
-Yes, ma'am.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.003
Not only am I the
administrative assistant,

08:58.105 --> 09:00.906
but I'm also
the resident decorator.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.974
I wear a lot of hats
around here, pastor.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.610
Luke 12:48...

09:05.712 --> 09:07.746
-"too whom much is given..."
-"much is required."

09:07.848 --> 09:10.315
amen, pastor.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.717
You'll get the hang of things
around here soon enough.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.152
Now, let me show you
to your office.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.687
Okay.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.625
Well, normally, I handle
the day-to-day operations

09:20.727 --> 09:22.260
so that you can just focus
on the ministries

09:22.362 --> 09:23.562
and grow our church.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.330
Well, that was the agreement

09:25.432 --> 09:26.331
between pastor byrd and me.

09:26.433 --> 09:29.367
It's totally okay
if you wanna change it.

09:29.469 --> 09:31.269
Oh, no, no.
In the spirit of pastor byrd,

09:31.371 --> 09:34.205
let's, let's just keep it
the way it is.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.841
Do miss that man.
He was a great pastor.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.844
Big shoes to fill.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.048
But you'll be all right.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.284
Here's your office, pastor.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.424
Oh.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.966
[chuckles]

10:01.068 --> 10:02.200
welcome to your new office,
pastor.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.969
I got a little fun and free
back here.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.905
It's, it's so festive.

10:07.007 --> 10:10.008
Thank you, pastor! I was so
proud of the way it turned out.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.310
I had to put it
on the social medias.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.212
It's just a little more
than I anticipated.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.781
I-I'm more simple,

10:16.883 --> 10:19.684
modest, clean lines, you know.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.621
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

10:22.723 --> 10:23.955
Oh, don't worry about that,

10:24.057 --> 10:26.825
brother carl is working
on your name plate.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.028
That's pastor byrd.
I'm so sorry.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.498
-I'll take it out immediately.
-It's okay.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.101
-And this?
-That's the winter jamboree.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.268
It's the highlight of
greenwood's christmas season.

10:37.371 --> 10:40.772
Every christmas eve,
genesis opens up the festival.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.008
-It's tradition!
-I love tradition.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.243
Gonna miss mine this year.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.911
Well, who said you couldn't
bring your tradition

10:47.014 --> 10:49.514
to greenwood, pastor?
What's your favorite tradition?

10:49.616 --> 10:52.217
-The christmas party.
-Oh, I love a good party.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.518
We're gonna circle back
around to that.

10:53.620 --> 10:57.288
Okay. Did pastor byrd
direct the choir?

10:57.391 --> 10:58.890
Oh, pastor, our choir was fire!

10:58.992 --> 11:00.659
Pastor byrd took great pride
in it.

11:00.761 --> 11:04.195
Next to the almighty himself,
music was his true love.

11:04.297 --> 11:08.767
-A singing pastor.
-Oh, he did it all.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.969
But I know you got this!

11:11.071 --> 11:13.438
[whispering] I don't know, god.

11:13.540 --> 11:17.042
-You say something, pastor?
-U-um, uh-hmm.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.744
-The parsonage?
-Oh, yes! Well... No.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.713
There was no saving
the parsonage.

11:21.815 --> 11:25.750
So until we find you a place,
you're staying with me.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.453
-Oh, no, um, miss, miss--
-no, ma'am.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.989
It's settled.

11:34.428 --> 11:36.928
Oh, what has momma done.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.635
[bell rings]

11:45.572 --> 11:47.672

welcome to selah's.
What can I do you for?

11:56.116 --> 11:57.582
Well, I hear you have
the best burger in town.

11:57.684 --> 12:00.118
-And you heard right.
-Nice.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.519
-With or without cheese?
-Without.

12:01.621 --> 12:02.654
Coming right up. Uh...

12:02.756 --> 12:06.024
Your money's no good here,
pastor.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.127
[chuckles] it's a small town.
Word travels quick.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.996
It'll be up in a minute.
Find yourself a seat.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.965
Thank you.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.202
Pastor olivia?

12:17.304 --> 12:20.271

12:21.708 --> 12:23.441
Sure.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.546
[instrumental music]

12:31.084 --> 12:33.685
I didn't expect to see you again
so soon.

12:35.288 --> 12:38.056
I wasn't looking for you,
I'm-I'm just saying...

12:38.158 --> 12:38.790
Y-you... Yeah.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.358
Well, this is a small town,

12:40.460 --> 12:41.993
I'll probably see you
two more times

12:42.095 --> 12:42.427
by the end of the night.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.229
Really?

12:44.331 --> 12:47.966
-Stella, this is--
-pastor olivia.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.567
Come on, ashton, catch up!

12:49.669 --> 12:53.471
-Now, you two, enjoy.
-Thank you.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.944
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.815
Oh, so you... You gonna eat that
with a knife and fork?

13:03.917 --> 13:06.751
It's a burger.
You're supposed to pick it up

13:06.853 --> 13:10.588
with your hands
and bite into it.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.892
Ooh, look at the...
You have a...

13:13.994 --> 13:15.794
-It's supposed to be messy.
-Uh-huh.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.229
I would prefer to keep my sauce
on my burger.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.165
[chuckles]

13:20.267 --> 13:22.400
whatever.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.669
I can get you a knife and fork
if you really want.

13:24.771 --> 13:25.970
Uh, no, thank you.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.740
-You're somethin' else.
-Oh...

13:29.976 --> 13:32.243
[laughing]

13:33.513 --> 13:34.846
I was just like...

13:34.948 --> 13:37.182
Oh, my god.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.817
I didn't realize
how much time had passed.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.785
I'm sure miss dee
is worried about me.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.353
-You at dee's?
-Yeah.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.089
That's right around the corner.
I'll walk you.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.358
-Okay.
-Okay.

13:49.596 --> 13:53.064
So, what brings you
to greenwood?

13:53.300 --> 13:57.101
-[sighs] my mother.
-Mm.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.838
Yeah, she got to talking with
her old spelman friend,

13:59.940 --> 14:02.240
miss corrine and, uh,

14:02.342 --> 14:04.042
the two of them devised this
plan to get me here.

14:04.144 --> 14:08.379
Wow, so your mother
and miss corrine

14:08.481 --> 14:08.913

14:09.015 --> 14:12.417
-Nope.
-I know.

-No, no, no option there.
-No.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.623

so effortlessly.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.659
How am I supposed to be like
her? Or pastor byrd?

14:21.761 --> 14:25.864
Just, just some
huge shoes to fill.

14:25.966 --> 14:29.234
Well, maybe you're just supposed
to be like you.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.036
I'm all too familiar with trying
to be something I'm not.

14:32.138 --> 14:35.406
Oh. And what was that?

14:37.010 --> 14:39.811
Well, lookie here,
we have arrived.

14:39.913 --> 14:44.015
Pastor, it has been my pleasure
spending my afternoon with you.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.417
Please just call me olivia.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.052
And the pleasure was all mine.

14:48.154 --> 14:51.122
-Maybe I'll see you tomorrow?
-It's a small town.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.457

and to grow--

you think you know
the first thing

18:02.916 --> 18:06.250
about running a church,

-Oh.

We ain't got no time to try.

you fail the church.

this is your trial period.

18:46.526 --> 18:49.360

bring a word on Sunday.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.119
Hmm, I know you're gonna be
just as strong

20:22.222 --> 20:24.055
and powerful as your mother.

20:24.157 --> 20:28.092
Hmm, and ain't nothing like
a singing pastor.

20:28.194 --> 20:31.295
-Singing?
-Uh, yes, ma'am.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.398
The church wanted
another singing pastor.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.969
And if you can sing
anything like your mother,

20:38.071 --> 20:39.904
we gonna be all right.

is looking for a place to stay.

21:06.199 --> 21:08.499

on Sunday, pastor.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.535
Yes, ma'am.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.274
Mother?

21:17.377 --> 21:20.544
Okay, so you are a man
of many hats.

21:20.647 --> 21:23.714
Man of many hats

21:25.852 --> 21:28.119

[instrumental music]

21:37.130 --> 21:38.829
etta...

21:45.872 --> 21:48.406
I have to sing
to keep my job, mom.

21:48.508 --> 21:51.442
<i> -Well, hello to you too, livi.</i>
-Why would you do that?

21:51.544 --> 21:54.078
Why would you send me here
knowing I don't sing?

21:54.180 --> 21:57.281
<i> Livi, you do sing.</i>

21:57.383 --> 21:59.684
yeah, mom, I don't wanna
hear that, okay?

21:59.786 --> 22:03.754
I'm not you. No one can be
the great pastor etta richard.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.624

sing, not me!

but right now, I just...

22:26.946 --> 22:28.813
I gotta go.

22:37.457 --> 22:41.659
I did not put my best foot
forward today.

22:41.761 --> 22:45.029
My mother has never been late
for a leadership meeting.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.898
She always says, "the church is
a direct reflection

22:48.000 --> 22:51.502
of its leadership,
inadequate shepard, lost sheep."

22:51.604 --> 22:55.506
your mother is a
powerful preacher.

22:57.243 --> 22:59.410
You've heard my mom preach?

22:59.512 --> 23:03.614
Corrine dragged me to chicago
a few times to hear her.

23:03.716 --> 23:07.952
Now, your momma
can bring the word. And sing.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.620
I can't wait to hear
that voice on you!

23:09.722 --> 23:11.088
-I don't sing.
-Well, sure, you do.

23:11.190 --> 23:14.759

23:29.142 --> 23:30.808

23:30.910 --> 23:32.410
I've been thinking
about that list

23:32.512 --> 23:34.211
sister ida was rattling off,

23:34.313 --> 23:36.147
and it's intimidating.

23:36.249 --> 23:37.248
I don't wanna fail the church.
And god knows,

23:37.350 --> 23:40.684
I-I cannot fail my mom.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.953
Look, you're right,

23:43.055 --> 23:45.856
it's intimidating.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.759
But you got a calling, pastor.

23:48.861 --> 23:52.062
So, we'll take it
one step at a time.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.899
-"we?"
-yes.

23:55.001 --> 23:58.002
I'm with you all the way.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.771
And don't think pastor byrd
had it all together.

24:00.873 --> 24:04.008
His first year was a mess.
Girl, he almost quit.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.911
Now, back to that list.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.345
On Friday, brother carl's
gonna drop off

24:08.448 --> 24:09.880
the box of christmas cards.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.582
And the christmas committee
has already organized

24:11.684 --> 24:13.050
"the wrap it up"
toy wrapping party.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.152
-That's next Saturday.
-Next Saturday. Okay.

24:15.254 --> 24:18.856
-Just show up. Oh, on time.
-Mm-hmm.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.459
[laughs]

24:21.561 --> 24:26.630
now, tell me about the sermon
you're preparing for Sunday.

24:26.732 --> 24:28.699
Well...

24:29.669 --> 24:33.604
It's about turning...

24:33.706 --> 24:36.173
-Let the church say, amen!
-Amen.

24:36.275 --> 24:37.341
Amen, amen!
Before we begin,

24:37.443 --> 24:39.243
I want to take a moment
to thank miss dee--

24:39.345 --> 24:43.147
you're welcome, pastor.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.114
Thank you so much, miss dee.

24:44.217 --> 24:46.717
I understand
it is tradition for her

24:46.819 --> 24:49.587
to do the decorations
around the holidays.

24:49.689 --> 24:52.590
I also understand it is
tradition to count down

24:52.692 --> 24:54.625
to the glorious jamboree!

24:54.727 --> 24:56.727
[cheering]

24:59.632 --> 25:01.765
hallelujah! Now on that note,

25:01.868 --> 25:04.969
the word says to "make a joyful
noise unto the lord."

25:05.071 --> 25:06.637
[cheering]

25:06.739 --> 25:07.404
it says to serve
the lord with...

25:07.507 --> 25:10.140
-Gladness!
-Hallelu...

25:10.243 --> 25:12.243
It says to come before his
presence with singing.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.245
Come on, choir,
bless us through song.

25:14.347 --> 25:18.082
-All right, praise jesus.
-Praise jesus.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.684
Yes, god!

-No.

Sister ida is mean.

And somebody should tell her.

Oh, no, honey, god's got to a

And he knows my heart
and I ain't it.

27:19.755 --> 27:21.755
I thought pastor was gonna sing
during her sermon.

27:21.857 --> 27:26.126
She will.
In god's time, not in our time.

27:27.096 --> 27:30.064
Well, it's nice having
a female leader.

27:31.801 --> 27:34.768
Is she gonna be okay?
Make it to the new year?

27:34.870 --> 27:37.037
Yeah, just give her some time.

27:37.139 --> 27:40.741
Just give her some time.

30:45.995 --> 30:48.829
-Oh. I play a little.
-A little?

30:48.931 --> 30:50.898
You should be sharing this gift
with the world.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.668
Well, I should be. But maybe
god saw it differently.

30:54.770 --> 30:58.205
-That didn't work out.
-Oh, I can't believe that.

30:58.307 --> 31:00.440
So, why didn't it work out?

31:00.543 --> 31:02.709
What didn't work out?
The singing? The playing?

31:02.811 --> 31:04.344
Because your gift--

31:04.446 --> 31:06.914
are you trying to pastor me
right now?

31:07.216 --> 31:09.550
-Please don't.
-No, I-I...

31:09.652 --> 31:10.851
I wasn't trying to pastor you.

31:10.953 --> 31:13.987
I was genuinely interested.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.457
I'm sorry.

31:17.560 --> 31:19.393
You didn't deserve that.

31:21.163 --> 31:22.629
I failed as a musician.

31:22.731 --> 31:25.399
My motto is
"you gotta be all in."

31:25.501 --> 31:28.635
'cause that's how you
gotta live life.

31:28.737 --> 31:30.370
So, I moved to houston,
and connected

31:30.472 --> 31:32.205
with some of auntie ida's
old band members

31:32.308 --> 31:35.242
and started gigging.

31:35.344 --> 31:36.710
Everything was going great.

31:36.812 --> 31:40.247
We were making money,
packing the house,

31:40.349 --> 31:42.182
working on a record deal.

31:43.285 --> 31:45.218
And then the bottom fell out.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.488
The deal just disappeared.

31:50.159 --> 31:55.028
So, I turned to what I know,
real estate.

31:55.130 --> 31:56.463
And I stayed in houston
until I finally got that call,

31:56.565 --> 32:01.468
"your father is ready to retire,
turn the business over to you."

32:01.570 --> 32:05.472
so started packing,
and now I'm here.

32:07.209 --> 32:09.142
I'm not mad to be home...

32:10.312 --> 32:13.113
'cause dope things
can happen anywhere.

32:20.956 --> 32:24.625
-You should play with us.
-Play with who?

32:24.727 --> 32:26.226
You should play for the church.

32:26.328 --> 32:28.462
Yeah, the-the church needs
a choir director,

32:28.564 --> 32:30.597
you need to be making music,
and I need somebody

32:30.699 --> 32:32.532
to whip that choir into shape.
Come on!

in that church in years.

it would be ideal

over as the choir director.

you got it from here.

weeks, but no pressure.

33:44.006 --> 33:46.339
You got this!

33:46.442 --> 33:49.576
Well, I thought we'd start off
with an old hymn.

-Knock knock! Howdy, pastor?
-How's the choir?

33:52.081 --> 33:53.780
-Here you go.
-Oh, wait, you...

You were supposed to deliver
those last Friday.

-It's Tuesday.
-I'm late.

do we have?

-What?

in the women's restroom.

to the community center.

for the community to see...

donated all of these toys.

bigger and bigger.

It's crazy, just five years ago
auntie ida started this drive.

Wait, sister ida
started the toy drive?

35:10.726 --> 35:13.527
Yep, a little girl
walked up to her,

35:13.629 --> 35:15.462
asked her for some change
for her family.

35:15.564 --> 35:16.930
Auntie says she looked around,
realized

35:17.032 --> 35:19.099
she was in the middle
of a homeless encampment.

35:19.201 --> 35:22.102
There was a small christmas tree
and nativity scene.

35:22.204 --> 35:25.172
And right then she just knew.

35:25.274 --> 35:27.274
-Sister ida?
-Mm-hmm!

35:27.376 --> 35:30.243
Yeah, she just bought up
a bunch of toys,

35:30.345 --> 35:32.779
gave some to the little girl and
started passing out the rest

35:32.881 --> 35:33.947
to the church members in need.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.649

yeah, kinda of became a thing.

35:35.751 --> 35:37.150

35:37.252 --> 35:39.286
We're talking about that,
that one,

35:39.388 --> 35:41.721
that sister ida started this?

-She's grieving.
-She's grieving.

35:45.027 --> 35:47.027
Okay, sister ida.

35:50.432 --> 35:52.199
Excuse me, everyone,
if I could have your attention

35:52.301 --> 35:54.434
for a moment?

35:57.639 --> 35:59.639
When I found out
that the toy wrapping party

35:59.741 --> 36:02.375
was a genesis tradition,
it warmed my heart.

36:02.477 --> 36:06.613
And it really made me miss the
christmas traditions from home.

36:06.715 --> 36:10.016
Miss dee said I didn't have to
leave my traditions in chicago,

36:10.118 --> 36:10.617
she said I could
bring them here.

36:10.719 --> 36:13.420
So, at mount bethel,

36:13.522 --> 36:14.855
we have the giving wreath.

36:14.957 --> 36:17.557
It does come with one rule,
in order to take something,

36:17.659 --> 36:19.059
you must leave something.

36:19.161 --> 36:22.329
A token, a small handmade
something, a card.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.231
Anything that will allow it
to continue to give

36:24.333 --> 36:27.167
throughout the advent season.

36:27.269 --> 36:30.370
Just a special way to continue
to celebrate each other.

36:30.472 --> 36:33.940
So, please enjoy the wreath
that keeps on giving!

-oh, I'm going first!
-No.

36:38.413 --> 36:40.513
[laughter]

36:42.050 --> 36:44.818
well, that is so great.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.721
Yeah, my dad loves christmas.

36:47.823 --> 36:49.656
He made up this tradition.

36:49.758 --> 36:52.425
He wanted the church to give
back to the community more,

36:52.527 --> 36:53.927
during the season.

36:54.029 --> 36:56.630
Okay, well, since
we're sharing traditions,

36:56.732 --> 36:58.732
how about I introduce you
to greenwood's

36:58.834 --> 37:00.133
annual cookie hop
tomorrow night?

37:00.235 --> 37:02.168
A cookie hop?

37:02.271 --> 37:05.672
-Sounds fun.
-It is.

37:05.774 --> 37:07.774
So it's a date?

37:15.050 --> 37:18.118
Ah, saved you a piece
of christmas pie.

37:18.220 --> 37:19.719
Yes!

37:20.989 --> 37:25.425
[sighs] so, about that hot date
tomorrow night.

37:25.527 --> 37:27.560
I should've known
you were listening.

37:27.663 --> 37:29.296
Oh, pastor, it's not my fault
your business

37:29.398 --> 37:30.297
is the talk of the town.

37:30.399 --> 37:31.898
The town?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.199
Aww, don't be embarrassed.
What else we gone talk about?

37:33.302 --> 37:35.669
It's the juiciest thing
we got going on.

37:35.771 --> 37:40.307
And the cookie hop, such a
public and festive evening out.

37:40.409 --> 37:43.576
-Everybody's gonna be there?
-Oh, everybody, pastor.

37:43.679 --> 37:44.811
So, what are we wearing?

37:44.913 --> 37:50.083
Well, I-I was thinking this,
but in a different color.

37:51.086 --> 37:53.887
Pastor, it's a date,
not a baptismal.

37:53.989 --> 37:56.323
Show a little shoulder.

37:56.425 --> 37:58.425
Oh, now, come on, grab that
wreath and the hot glue gun.

37:58.527 --> 38:01.795
-Okay.
-And let's talk cookie hop.

38:01.897 --> 38:03.897
[both laughing]

38:10.372 --> 38:13.606
-ashton?
-Oh, wow.

38:13.709 --> 38:17.477
[chuckles] you look absolutely
beautiful.

38:19.114 --> 38:21.414
Your hand, please.

38:21.516 --> 38:23.817
I got us wrist bands so we can
sample all the cookies.

38:23.919 --> 38:25.585
Mm-hmm?
Now what is a cookie hop?

38:25.687 --> 38:28.722
Okay. So every christmas,

38:28.824 --> 38:30.957
all the bakers, professional
or not, they all compete

38:31.059 --> 38:32.559
for the "best cookie in town"
title.

38:32.661 --> 38:35.929
Oh. See, we don't have that
in chicago,

38:36.031 --> 38:38.198
so this is gonna be fun.

38:38.300 --> 38:41.735
Uh, come on.

38:42.270 --> 38:45.872
[instrumental music]

38:45.974 --> 38:48.875
[indistinct chatter]

38:59.421 --> 39:01.254
wait, so let's talk about
that perfect chord you

39:01.356 --> 39:02.188
hit the other day.

39:02.290 --> 39:03.490
I don't know
what you talking about.

39:03.592 --> 39:04.824
-Yes, you do.
-Unh-unh.

39:04.926 --> 39:08.862
-So you play a little?
-A little.

39:08.964 --> 39:10.463
I come from a family
of musicians and singers.

39:10.565 --> 39:13.166
My mother, grandfather,
great-grandfather.

39:13.268 --> 39:16.736
-All singing pastors.
-Wait, so you sing.

39:16.838 --> 39:19.005
-Let's hear it!
-Nope. My mother sings.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.774
-I listen.
-Mm, come on, let me hear you.

39:20.876 --> 39:23.910
I don't sing. I don't.
Plus, we're at a cookie hop.

39:24.012 --> 39:28.081
Nah, I'm with you.

39:28.183 --> 39:30.717
-So tell me why you don't sing.
-Ashton, come on.

39:36.091 --> 39:37.924
Fine.

39:40.328 --> 39:41.861
Being a preacher's kid is a lot,

39:41.963 --> 39:44.431
but being a pk under
my mother's shadow,

39:44.533 --> 39:47.200
even now,
it's a ton of pressure.

39:47.302 --> 39:49.936
-And?
-And...

39:50.038 --> 39:51.204
[chuckles]

39:51.306 --> 39:53.206
it was my first solo.

39:53.308 --> 39:55.108
It's kind of a rite of passage
in our family.

39:55.210 --> 39:57.077
I had to be like 15 or 16.

39:57.179 --> 40:00.513
And there I was
shaking like a leaf.

40:00.615 --> 40:03.817
And I did it
and I was so proud of myself,

40:03.919 --> 40:05.819
until the room got quiet.

40:05.921 --> 40:12.292
I open my eyes and the choir
director comes to me and says,

40:12.394 --> 40:15.061
"you're supposed to be
pastor richard's daughter

40:15.163 --> 40:16.429
and that's all you got."

40:16.531 --> 40:19.032
wow.

40:20.335 --> 40:25.004
I just stood there ashamed
and in disbelief.

40:26.108 --> 40:28.608
I'm sorry to hear that.

40:29.878 --> 40:32.278
-Church hurt is real.
-Yeah.

40:33.748 --> 40:34.347
But I still wanna hear you sing.

40:34.449 --> 40:36.416
-Boy!
-I'm just saying.

40:36.518 --> 40:38.017
I mean, look,
this is all we got.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.452
-You gotta be all in.
-All in.

40:39.554 --> 40:41.754
-Yes, I know your motto.
-Right. Yup, all the time.

40:41.857 --> 40:44.958
Wait, hold up.
Did she keep her job?

40:45.060 --> 40:46.559
Did she... No, no!

40:46.661 --> 40:48.862
-She was gone the next day.
-All right.

40:48.964 --> 40:50.396
All right.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.466
You got a little...

40:55.904 --> 40:58.371
[instrumental music]

41:08.383 --> 41:11.651
[sighs] trust in the lord
with all your heart

41:11.753 --> 41:14.921
and do not lean
on your own understanding.

41:16.625 --> 41:18.925
[cellphone chimes]

41:32.040 --> 41:33.840
[groans]

41:41.716 --> 41:42.916
[indistinct chatter]

41:43.018 --> 41:46.619
sister ida, it would be nice
to hear some good news from you.

41:46.721 --> 41:48.721
Dee, don't you use that tone
with me, little girl.

41:48.823 --> 41:51.658
I know your mama.
I'm just sayin',

41:51.760 --> 41:55.428
I got strong numbers on that
board ready to vote her out.

41:55.530 --> 41:59.966
We're looking
for a singing pastor. A leader.

42:05.974 --> 42:10.376
Ashton, play my song. I need a
little holiday joy up in here.

You snooze, you lose.

49:06.928 --> 49:08.461
Oh, you ain't right.

49:08.563 --> 49:10.696
[chuckles]
ah! Nice move.

49:10.798 --> 49:11.998
Ah!

49:13.134 --> 49:14.266
You know...

49:15.169 --> 49:18.204
I'm starting to like
being just olivia.

49:18.306 --> 49:21.273
-Tic-tac-toe! I win!
-Wh... What?

49:21.376 --> 49:24.310
[both laugh]

49:26.881 --> 49:28.714
I like just olivia.

49:39.877 --> 49:44.413
"in his glorious name...

49:45.350 --> 49:46.415
Pastor olivia."

49:46.517 --> 49:49.618
[chuckles softly]
they may not be on time,

49:49.721 --> 49:50.453
but they are in god's time.

49:50.555 --> 49:52.221
-You want me to help?
-No, no.

49:52.323 --> 49:55.491
Pastor byrd did it, so can I.

49:55.593 --> 49:58.694
A little secret,
I helped him.

49:58.796 --> 49:59.862
[chuckles]

49:59.964 --> 50:02.398
-[sighs] I'm gonna head out.
-Okay.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.800
Want me to pick you up
a coco-lada shake?

50:04.902 --> 50:07.236
-Yes, please.
-See you in a bit.

50:07.338 --> 50:07.770
Bye.

50:07.872 --> 50:10.206
Okay.

50:16.414 --> 50:19.081
-Yes...
-They're late.

50:19.951 --> 50:20.583
Yes.

50:20.685 --> 50:22.485
They will be late this year,

50:22.587 --> 50:25.688
but they'll get there.

50:25.790 --> 50:27.656
I'm starting to get
a handle on things.

50:27.759 --> 50:30.092
-Mm-hm.
-Did you hear the choir Sunday?

50:30.194 --> 50:32.695
Oh, they sounded amazing.

50:32.797 --> 50:34.797
[chuckles] I think
they're going to be ready.

50:34.899 --> 50:39.468
You think they're going to be
ready for exactly what?

50:39.570 --> 50:40.970
The winter jamboree.

50:41.072 --> 50:43.839
Ah, the same winter jamboree
that I told you

50:43.941 --> 50:45.641
it was imperative to
turn in the paperwork.

50:45.743 --> 50:48.677
-That winter jamboree?
-Yes.

50:48.780 --> 50:52.715
Then where in god's name
is the church on this flyer?

50:52.817 --> 50:55.518
Surely, not the headlining act.

50:55.620 --> 50:57.787
No, it can't be, be...

50:57.889 --> 51:00.990
This can't be, because I-I
definitely turned it in.

51:01.092 --> 51:02.191
-I know I did...
-[ida] oh.

51:02.293 --> 51:05.561
[ida] this is you
handling things?

51:05.663 --> 51:08.764
Well, I'm gonna call an
emergency leadership meeting.

51:08.866 --> 51:14.236
I think we need to seriously
discuss your trial period.

51:16.641 --> 51:18.340
Why do you hate me?

51:20.812 --> 51:22.611
I don't hate you.

51:23.781 --> 51:25.581
You, you don't belong here.

51:25.683 --> 51:28.384
And you're not a leader
like my brother.

51:28.486 --> 51:31.287
Your brother was a
great man of god...

51:31.389 --> 51:36.392
And you better never forget.

You must be here to volunteer.

Oh, no. No.
I'm olivia.

over at genesis.

52:26.577 --> 52:27.710

-Hi.

52:27.812 --> 52:30.813
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear
about pastor byrd.

52:30.915 --> 52:32.414
That man had a heart for giving.

52:32.517 --> 52:34.750
And his choir, oh!
You know, it's a shame

52:34.852 --> 52:36.318
they won't be participating
this year.

52:36.420 --> 52:38.487
Actually, that's what I'm
wanting to discuss.

52:38.589 --> 52:39.255
We want to participate.

52:39.357 --> 52:41.190
Oh, pastor, I'm sorry.

52:41.292 --> 52:43.459
That paperwork had to be
in a week ago.

52:43.561 --> 52:45.094
I mean, normally pastor byrd
would've had it

52:45.196 --> 52:47.663
in a month in advance,
and since I didn't hear anything

52:47.765 --> 52:49.965
from the church, I had to
book another act.

52:50.067 --> 52:53.502
Mr. Hanks, I need a win here.
Okay?

52:53.604 --> 52:55.604
I-I can't go back to that choir
and tell them that

52:55.706 --> 52:57.706
all of this hard work they've
been doing is for naught.

52:57.808 --> 52:59.808
I forgot to turn in
the paperwork,

52:59.911 --> 53:02.578
that's on me, not them.
Please just...

53:02.680 --> 53:05.314
In the spirit of christmas,
let them perform.

53:05.416 --> 53:08.551
Pastor, I wish I could, but the
lineup's already booked.

53:08.653 --> 53:11.086
There just isn't any room.

53:11.822 --> 53:14.190
Just like with mary and joseph.

53:14.292 --> 53:18.794
But this is the season
for miracles.

-Stop, just...
-[ashton] no, seriously.

It's like you told me, you,

55:27.658 --> 55:29.191
you got to share this
with the world.

55:29.293 --> 55:32.861
Uh-uh. No.
What are you doing here?

55:35.766 --> 55:36.865
You talked to your auntie.

55:36.967 --> 55:38.901
[scoffs] of course, she couldn't
keep that to herself.

55:39.003 --> 55:43.105
I cannot believe I forgot
to turn in the paperwork.

55:43.207 --> 55:46.842
I don't understand how my mother
juggles this responsibility.

55:46.944 --> 55:48.444
Why didn't you
just ask for help?

55:48.546 --> 55:49.945
[olivia chuckles] uh-uh. No.

55:50.047 --> 55:52.514
And give sister ida, your
auntie, more ammunition?

55:52.616 --> 55:55.250
You know how she loves pointing
at my grave mistakes.

55:55.353 --> 55:56.518
Oh. Come on, olivia, no.

55:56.620 --> 56:00.155
-She's...
-She's grieving. I know.

56:02.626 --> 56:04.660
But I think I have an idea.

56:05.196 --> 56:07.963
Come up, I'll show you.

56:11.052 --> 56:12.718
[olivia] come on. Okay.

56:12.820 --> 56:15.387
So I found the band on the
flyer that's headlining.

56:15.489 --> 56:17.823
It's a rock band,
but it's gonna work. Trust me.

56:17.925 --> 56:20.526
I trust you,
but is it gonna work?

56:20.628 --> 56:22.694
I've done my research.
Come on, where's my support?

56:22.797 --> 56:24.630
We got this.

56:24.732 --> 56:28.000
[upbeat music]

56:43.317 --> 56:46.785
right.
So, what do you think?

56:46.887 --> 56:48.887
-They sound great.
-I know.

56:48.989 --> 56:51.190
Do you think they'll be
down to play gospel?

56:51.292 --> 56:53.725
Oh, ye of little faith. Red.

56:53.828 --> 56:55.727
-Hey. What's up?
-Hey. Hi, I'm olivia.

56:55.830 --> 57:00.232
-And this is... Ashton.
-Wassup?

57:00.334 --> 57:01.667
-[chuckles]
-right.

57:01.769 --> 57:04.770
And you were looking for a
band to play at your church?

57:04.872 --> 57:08.006
Not exactly.
I wanted to pitch an idea.

57:08.109 --> 57:11.110
So, you know the choir that
normally opens the jamboree?

57:11.212 --> 57:13.812
Oh, yeah.
Their sound is sweet.

57:13.914 --> 57:15.414
Yeah. It is.

57:15.516 --> 57:17.216
I'm actually kind of nervous
that, ah, we're replacing them,

57:17.318 --> 57:18.851
'cause we don't sing,
and you know,

57:18.953 --> 57:20.119
people want to hear singing.

57:20.221 --> 57:23.355
Well, you know, since you
don't sing and we do,

57:23.457 --> 57:25.491
how about we perform together?

57:25.593 --> 57:26.925
Do what now?

57:27.027 --> 57:30.629
Look, I'm the new pastor
at genesis and I...

57:30.731 --> 57:31.730
I forgot to submit
the paperwork.

57:31.832 --> 57:34.533
-[chuckles]
-I know. Yes, that's on me.

57:34.635 --> 57:35.834
But I figured
it was worth a shot

57:35.936 --> 57:36.602
to see if we could collaborate.

57:36.704 --> 57:38.403
Ah, but it's one week.

57:38.506 --> 57:41.673
Plus, I don't know.
Rock and gospel?

57:41.775 --> 57:45.043
Yeah. I'm hearing a whole
other sound all together.

57:45.146 --> 57:46.945
Yeah, and we don't sing,
so voices could be cool.

57:47.047 --> 57:49.948
And you said yourself,
people want to hear singing.

57:50.050 --> 57:52.184
-[laughing] I did say that.
-That's the "gotcha."

57:52.286 --> 57:54.553
[chuckles]

57:54.655 --> 57:55.888
yeah.

57:55.990 --> 57:57.523
[ida] rock and roll?

57:57.625 --> 57:59.458
Assistant pastor,
is this is your solution?

57:59.560 --> 58:00.859
Now, wait a minute, ida.
Give her a chance to explain.

58:00.961 --> 58:03.962
Yes. It is my solution.

58:04.064 --> 58:05.597
Look, I know
I failed the church.

58:05.699 --> 58:07.866
But god has given us an
opportunity for the choir

58:07.968 --> 58:09.668
to perform and for us
to minister.

58:09.770 --> 58:11.770
I'm not gonna
turn my back on that.

58:11.872 --> 58:14.506
Besides, I believe pastor byrd
would be honored.

58:14.608 --> 58:16.942
Don't bring my brother
into this.

58:17.044 --> 58:18.043
He is this.

58:18.145 --> 58:20.546
He is the embodiment of
the christmas spirit.

58:20.648 --> 58:22.714
He was the servant for the king,
he loved the people

58:22.816 --> 58:25.651
and the people loved him. And I
think this is a beautiful way

58:25.753 --> 58:27.452
to celebrate his legacy.

58:27.555 --> 58:31.690
Well, you may be on to something
there. But rock-n-roll?

58:31.792 --> 58:36.361
Ain't nothing wrong with a
little prince for the prince.

58:36.463 --> 58:37.963
[stella chuckling]
yeah, sister ida.

58:38.065 --> 58:40.399
I mean, kirk franklin
had a rock song.

58:40.501 --> 58:43.468
Well, you know I love me
some kirk. He's a bad boy.

58:43.571 --> 58:45.571
But don't you all be bringing
the prince up in here,

58:45.673 --> 58:48.273
'cause the only dove that's
going to be crying in here

58:48.375 --> 58:50.008
is the prince of peace.

58:50.110 --> 58:54.346
Aww, bunny, you know you like
a little controversy.

58:54.448 --> 58:56.582
[ida] stop, boy. Stop, boy!

58:56.684 --> 59:01.053
What'd I tell you about
calling me "bunny" in public?

59:03.123 --> 59:05.123
Let us never discuss that.

59:05.226 --> 59:06.458
-[stella] okay.
-Agreed.

59:06.560 --> 59:10.195
[chuckles] pastor,
this is going to be epic!

59:10.297 --> 59:12.864
You on to something, pastor.
[chuckles]

59:13.701 --> 59:16.468
your mother would be so proud.

59:17.538 --> 59:19.838
Proud.

59:22.910 --> 59:24.209
Thank you.

59:25.312 --> 59:28.447
[indistinct chatter]

59:28.549 --> 59:30.082
all right, everybody,
let's have a seat.

59:30.184 --> 59:32.551
Now let's talk about
this jamboree.

59:32.653 --> 59:36.054
We goin' to put a little funk
in<i> o come all ye faithful!</i>

59:36.156 --> 59:37.889
[stella giggling]

59:37.992 --> 59:40.926
-so sorry. Proceed.
-Stella is correct.

59:41.028 --> 59:43.228
We're going to collaborate with
red and his rock band.

59:43.330 --> 59:44.796
And stella's going
to sing the lead.

59:44.898 --> 59:47.733
-Really?
-Come on, y'all.

59:47.835 --> 59:49.468
Pastor just forgot to turn in
the jamboree paperwork.

59:49.570 --> 59:51.937
-Oh!
-What?

59:52.039 --> 59:54.206
Yes... I...
Okay. Yes, I did.

59:54.308 --> 59:57.609
I did. But god led me to ask
red if we could collaborate.

59:57.711 --> 59:59.211
Not only in memory
of pastor byrd,

59:59.313 --> 1:00:01.480
but in the spirit of christmas,
and he said yes.

1:00:01.582 --> 1:00:04.549
We got our own
christmas miracle.

1:00:04.652 --> 1:00:06.184
So on that note, let's jump
on this rehearsal.

1:00:06.287 --> 1:00:09.688
Y'all, this is gonna be epic.
I can feel it.

1:00:09.790 --> 1:00:11.223
That's right.

1:00:11.959 --> 1:00:13.792
Aw, thanks, mom.

1:00:13.894 --> 1:00:17.029
Yeah, I feel...
I'm feeling much better.

1:00:17.131 --> 1:00:19.765
Uh, oh, I-I got dad's new
golf clubs for christmas,

1:00:19.867 --> 1:00:21.733
and I know every year I ask you
what you want,

1:00:21.835 --> 1:00:23.702
but I figured that
I would just gotta...

1:00:23.804 --> 1:00:26.705
-[laughing] look at me.
-This is what you bought?

1:00:26.807 --> 1:00:28.540
All right, all right, all right.

1:00:28.642 --> 1:00:30.175
[destiny] oh, my god!

1:00:30.277 --> 1:00:31.310
I'm sorry, mom.
What'd you say?

1:00:31.412 --> 1:00:34.846
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

1:00:37.651 --> 1:00:40.585
[dramatic music]

Oh, you will know the truth,

1:12:18.001 --> 1:12:19.500
and the truth will set you free.

-Pastor...
-[olivia] no.

1:12:35.352 --> 1:12:37.285
-The congregation needs you.
-Okay, don't do this.

1:12:37.387 --> 1:12:38.486
-Look, you got to go on.
-Stop it.

1:12:38.588 --> 1:12:41.389
-[olivia] just stop it, okay?
-Now's the time to lead.

1:12:41.491 --> 1:12:43.825
Please, stop asking me.
Don't ask me again.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

-I didn't mean to upset you.
-Yeah, well, you did.

1:13:01.244 --> 1:13:02.877
And you embarrassed me.

1:13:04.214 --> 1:13:06.080
Don't you think I want to be
there for the church?

1:13:06.182 --> 1:13:08.416
-Save my job?
-Livi...

1:13:08.518 --> 1:13:10.184
That's what they want, right?
A singing pastor.

1:13:10.286 --> 1:13:11.953
I-I... I don't sing.

1:13:12.055 --> 1:13:14.222
-Yes, you do.
-I cannot be "all in" like you.

1:13:14.324 --> 1:13:16.691
-I'm not wired that way.
-Yes, you are.

1:13:16.793 --> 1:13:19.060
What do you say to the
congregation every Sunday?

1:13:19.162 --> 1:13:20.862
"let your faith be bigger
than your fears."

1:13:20.964 --> 1:13:24.465
-not now, ashton.
-Absolutely now, livi.

1:13:24.567 --> 1:13:27.335
Look, that choir,
they need you.

1:13:27.437 --> 1:13:29.470
I need you.

1:13:29.572 --> 1:13:31.739
Now I'm sorry that choir
director embarrassed you,

1:13:31.841 --> 1:13:36.244
hurt you, but now, you get to
stand up to her.

1:13:36.346 --> 1:13:38.179
And I told you
I've got your back.

1:13:38.281 --> 1:13:41.582
Even if it means
giving you a push.

1:13:41.684 --> 1:13:42.350
A push?

1:13:42.452 --> 1:13:44.018
Yes, out of your comfort zone,

1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:47.021

young man, you did a fantastic
job with this choir.

1:23:09.685 --> 1:23:11.719
[sighs] thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1:23:11.821 --> 1:23:14.321
And those voices,
they need to go on the road.

1:23:14.423 --> 1:23:15.923
You know, I was thinking
the same thing.

1:23:16.025 --> 1:23:18.626
-First stop, chicago.
-Absolutely.

1:23:18.728 --> 1:23:22.529

1:23:29.939 --> 1:23:33.073
The church needed me.
I couldn't let them down.

1:23:33.175 --> 1:23:36.644
You needed me.
I couldn't let you down.

1:23:36.746 --> 1:23:38.612
