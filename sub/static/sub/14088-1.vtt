03:00.847 --> 03:04.021
With the power vested in me
by nobody in particular...

03:04.226 --> 03:09.448
I hereby crown you Princess Kuda,
ruler of the seven seas.

03:43.348 --> 03:47.353
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, my loyal subjects.

03:48.812 --> 03:53.113
Ladies and jellyfish,
let us celebrate my coronation...

03:53.316 --> 03:55.193
with a royal ball.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.872
Let joy be unconfined!

03:59.072 --> 04:01.791
May I have this dance, milady?

04:01.992 --> 04:04.620
Charmed, I'm sure.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.966
- Lumina?
- Aah.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.142
- Uh-oh.
- Aah!

04:28.185 --> 04:30.608
Lumina?

04:31.188 --> 04:32.690
Lumina.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.525
What was that commotion?

04:34.941 --> 04:35.988
Um...

04:36.610 --> 04:40.331
Oh, we were just playing
coronation, Aunt Scylla.

04:45.911 --> 04:49.290
Were you using your
pearl magic outside?

04:49.498 --> 04:50.715
Um...

04:50.916 --> 04:53.419
Well, maybe, just a little.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.722
Lumina,
I've told you and told you...

04:56.922 --> 04:59.175
- keep your powers private.
- Powers private.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.976
I know, Aunt Scylla.
I'm sorry, really.

05:02.177 --> 05:04.225
You have a very special gift...

05:04.429 --> 05:05.851
but if word got out...

05:06.056 --> 05:09.356
Well, all kinds of bad people
might come looking for you.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.902
But I don't understand.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.647
Who's gonna see me way out here?

05:13.855 --> 05:15.277
You don't need to understand.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.031
Please, just do as I say.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.206
Hello, Kuda.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.000
Hi, Aunt Scylla. Ha, ha.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.124
Ah. Great.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.925
Now your aunt's mad.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.173
And I've got clam dents in my head.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.255
Oh, you look fine.

05:38.463 --> 05:42.184
Hmm. Except for your hair.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.474
Uh-oh.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.898
Hmm.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.937
Uh-uh.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.240
Hmm.

06:11.746 --> 06:15.000
No. Still not right.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.260
I think that's the one.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.183
Let's see.
You need something to wear.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.243
There.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.621
Now you look like a princess.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.628
Hmm?

07:07.928 --> 07:11.353
And now we both look
like princesses.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.361
I wonder what a real
princess looks like.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.813
Yeah.

07:18.021 --> 07:21.070
And the royal castle.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.657
And all the beautiful mermaids
and their elegant clothes.

07:24.861 --> 07:28.206
Can you imagine the dances
they must have there?

07:28.406 --> 07:32.206
Kuda, you think we'll ever
really get to see the castle?

07:32.410 --> 07:33.878
Maybe.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.877
Someday.

07:36.081 --> 07:39.085
I bet it's just the most
wonderful place ever.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.717
I bet everyone there
is happy all the time.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.340
Your Gracious Majesties.

07:45.757 --> 07:50.354
All I ask is that you consent to
appear in public just one night.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.351
Your subjects need you.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.478
Your kingdom needs you.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.105
Dare I say it...

07:58.019 --> 07:59.817
I need you.

08:00.021 --> 08:04.743
Caligo, as I've told you many
times, Queen Lorelei and I...

08:04.943 --> 08:07.492
Of course, of course.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.448
And like you...

08:09.656 --> 08:14.002
I am inconsolable over
the lost princess.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.923
But we simply must face the fact...

08:18.123 --> 08:21.423
that with you and the
queen having no heir...

08:21.626 --> 08:25.506
the kingdom will one day pass
to your nephew, my son.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.926
Hello, <i>Neocrinus decorus.</i>

08:29.134 --> 08:31.853
And how are we today? Aah!

08:36.433 --> 08:38.231
I'm afraid Caligo is right.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.775
Perhaps it is time.

08:40.979 --> 08:44.859
Excellent! And since he'll also
need to choose a suitable wife...

08:45.066 --> 08:46.989
we'll give a royal ball.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.491
We'll invite only the
most beautiful...

08:49.696 --> 08:52.245
and eligible young
mermaids of the kingdom...

08:52.449 --> 08:57.797
for a chance to be my son's queen.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.999
Huh?

09:02.709 --> 09:04.256
Aah!

09:12.761 --> 09:16.015
Aah, aah, aah...

09:20.268 --> 09:21.315
Oh.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.773
Perhaps we should
invite all the maidens.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.654
And throw in a door prize.

09:26.858 --> 09:29.407
Whoa. Ugh.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.316
Yoo-hoo!

10:07.982 --> 10:09.450
Hmm.

10:09.818 --> 10:10.865
Aah!

10:11.069 --> 10:12.161
Oh, dear me.

10:12.362 --> 10:15.866
Did I frighten you? Ha-ha-ha.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.827
Who are you? What do you want?

10:19.369 --> 10:24.626
I go by many names,
but you may call me Murray.

10:24.833 --> 10:30.556
I come bearing an eel-mail from
an old friend of yours, Caligo.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.266
Hey!

10:33.633 --> 10:34.680
Out!

10:38.888 --> 10:42.267
I admit tracking you down
was a particular challenge.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.070
But my Bottom Feeders
Network came through.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.898
All right, you've found me.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.574
What is it you want?

10:49.774 --> 10:52.948
Ah, that famous hag hospitality.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.530
A simple request, really.

10:54.737 --> 11:00.540
My employer is once again in need
of your, um, professional services.

11:00.743 --> 11:04.373
Services? What services?

11:04.581 --> 11:07.926
Caligo convinced His Majesty to open
up the castle for a royal ball...

11:08.126 --> 11:11.471
at which time the king will confer
the Pearl of the Sea medallion...

11:11.671 --> 11:13.514
onto Caligo's son.

11:13.715 --> 11:19.393
His Majesty will then toast the boy
from a cup of merberry nectar.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.816
- Which Caligo wants me to poison.
- Exactly.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.815
The king croaks, the son is
crowned, everybody wins.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.191
Well, maybe not the king.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.648
Don't you love a happy ending?

11:29.856 --> 11:34.202
Well, you can tell your employer that
I'm no longer in the poisoning business.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.245
So unless you're
interested in buying...

11:36.446 --> 11:41.043
some gill glistener or
scale brightener, get out!

11:41.492 --> 11:42.618
He said you'd say that.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.501
I am, therefore, authorised
to issue the following threat:

11:46.039 --> 11:50.294
Do it or I'll tell everyone you
killed the princess. Ha-ha-ha.

11:50.501 --> 11:51.923
You wouldn't dare.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.801
He said you'd say that too.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.474
I am, therefore,
authorised to respond:

11:56.674 --> 11:58.722
Would so.

12:00.595 --> 12:01.642
Fine.

12:01.846 --> 12:06.568
If it's poison Caligo wants,
it's poison he'll get.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.190
A wise decision.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.867
Here, you'll need this
invitation to the ball.

12:15.985 --> 12:19.740
We'll leave the sordid details
in your expert hands.

12:19.948 --> 12:24.545
After all, it's really
all in the execution...

12:24.744 --> 12:26.712
wouldn't you agree?

12:28.164 --> 12:30.758
Now, don't be late, 8 p.m.,
Saturday, at the castle.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.961
- Castle?
- Huh?

12:33.336 --> 12:34.838
What about the castle?

12:40.551 --> 12:43.350
Well, well. And who is this?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.857
- Hmm.
- Hi. I'm Lum...

12:46.057 --> 12:48.105
- Late again for dinner.
- Aah!

12:48.309 --> 12:50.403
Our guest was just leaving.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.900
But, Aunt Scylla...

12:52.272 --> 12:53.569
Aunt Scylla?

12:53.773 --> 12:56.117
I assumed you lived alone.

12:56.317 --> 13:00.117
- Maybe I should...
- You assumed wrong. Get out!

13:00.613 --> 13:01.990
Aah!

13:05.410 --> 13:07.253
Hmm.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.429
Aunt Scylla.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.847
Hey!

13:24.262 --> 13:27.482
What was your friend talking about?
Did he mean the royal castle?

13:27.682 --> 13:28.899
Are you going there?

13:29.100 --> 13:30.693
Can I go? Can I go? Can I go?

13:30.893 --> 13:33.191
- Please?
- Lumina.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.741
I heard it has golden doors
and pearl chandeliers...

13:36.941 --> 13:39.364
and a beautiful throne,
and it must be wonderful.

13:39.569 --> 13:43.164
And I've always wanted to
go there, and so does Kuda.

13:43.364 --> 13:46.493
Absolutely not. I've told you
how dangerous the journey is.

13:46.701 --> 13:51.298
I do it to sell my potions, but it's
far too risky for a young girl alone.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.591
But I wouldn't be alone.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.252
I'd have you. And Kuda.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.213
And burning fire coral...

13:58.421 --> 14:01.391
and vampire squid and
poisonous stonefish.

14:02.842 --> 14:07.598
Lumina, neither of you has ever
been an inch outside this reef.

14:07.805 --> 14:08.852
Believe me...

14:09.057 --> 14:12.482
you wouldn't last two seconds,
even with me to keep an eye on you.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.655
- But...
- It's out of the question.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.404
Uh, I think that's a "no."

14:22.612 --> 14:25.832
I kind of stopped listening
after vampire squid.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.745
Now, you be good.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.580
I'll be back in a few days.

14:32.789 --> 14:36.919
And please, both of you,
stick close to home.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.712
Mm-hm.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.343
That's a good girl.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.138
Bye!

14:44.509 --> 14:46.352
Goodbye.

14:59.482 --> 15:02.452
I guess we're never gonna
get to see the castle, Kuda.

15:05.905 --> 15:09.705
Hey, wanna play tail tag? Huh?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.661
- You're it.
- Heh.

15:15.832 --> 15:16.879
Huh?

15:22.797 --> 15:25.721
Hmm. What's this?

15:28.636 --> 15:30.263
It's an invitation.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.314
She's not just going to the castle.

15:32.515 --> 15:35.189
She's invited to a royal ball.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.690
And she can't get in without this.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.069
Huh?

15:41.649 --> 15:44.368
Aunt Scylla! You forgot your...!

15:49.407 --> 15:51.125
Hmm.

15:56.164 --> 16:01.967
Kuda, we really should bring
this to her, don't you think?

16:02.670 --> 16:04.388
No, I don't think.

16:04.589 --> 16:07.012
Well, after all, she'll need
it to get into the ball.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.469
So when you think about it...

16:09.677 --> 16:12.476
it's really our duty
to go after her.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.183
All the way to the
castle if we have to.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.813
Lumina, no!

16:17.018 --> 16:18.611
She'll be furious.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.154
Were you listening to Scylla?

16:20.354 --> 16:22.027
- The dangerous journey?
- Psh.

16:22.190 --> 16:25.160
You mean the burning whatchamacallit
and the poisonous thingamapoo?

16:25.359 --> 16:29.159
It was the burning fire coral
and poisonous stonefish.

16:29.363 --> 16:32.116
Don't you see?
This is our big chance.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.043
Oh, Kuda, we've got to go.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.369
We've just got to.

16:35.578 --> 16:38.297
But... But... But...

16:38.748 --> 16:39.840
But... But... But...

16:40.041 --> 16:41.964
This has to be the right way.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.970
I've seen Aunt Scylla head this
way every time she goes to town.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.431
Unh.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.226
It's a dead end.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.026
Oh, darn. Oh, well, that's that.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.729
We gave it our best. Let's go home.

17:00.937 --> 17:04.066
Hmm. I just don't underst...

17:04.857 --> 17:06.450
Huh?

17:07.359 --> 17:08.703
Lumina.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.696
Wait for me!

17:20.455 --> 17:22.333
Oh, look, an opening.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.011
I bet that's her shortcut
through the coral.

17:25.211 --> 17:28.214
Follow me, Kuda. Don't be afraid.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.641
Make up your mind. I can't do both.

17:40.184 --> 17:45.657
Uh, Lumina, you do realise
we're inside a someone, right?

17:45.856 --> 17:48.484
Come on, Kuda. I bet the
end is right down here.

17:49.527 --> 17:52.326
Look at this. These are ribs.

17:52.530 --> 17:57.377
We're in a beast.
A big, huge... Uh-oh.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.168
Aah!

18:08.254 --> 18:09.676
This is not fun!

18:10.881 --> 18:12.098
Lumina!

18:12.300 --> 18:13.927
Swim!

18:14.135 --> 18:15.933
The invitation.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.659
Huh?

18:34.864 --> 18:36.036
Whoa!

18:40.953 --> 18:43.047
- Ha. Got it.
- Ahh.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.500
Okay, let's go.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.802
Oh, no.

18:55.176 --> 18:56.974
No, no, no!

18:57.595 --> 18:58.767
Oh, no!

19:09.774 --> 19:11.776
Know any more handy shortcuts?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.531
Aah. Oh, no.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.613
The invitation, it's gone.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.539
There.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.492
All right.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.000
A narwhal?

19:24.205 --> 19:27.175
- Now what?
- Come on, we just need to follow him.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.628
Here we go again.

19:32.672 --> 19:36.267
But, Father,
do I have to go to the ball?

19:36.467 --> 19:39.437
Yes, Fergie, because
it's being given for you.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.732
But I've told you,
I don't want to be king.

19:42.932 --> 19:46.152
I want to be a botanist.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.775
Forget about plants.

19:49.271 --> 19:53.492
You're going to be king and
that's the end of it, understood?

19:54.151 --> 19:57.405
Now, get back to
your waltz lessons.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.411
- Yes, sir.
- Hmph.

19:59.615 --> 20:03.119
Forgive me, <i>Neocrinus decorus.</i>

20:07.581 --> 20:08.628
Ah.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.256
The Pearl of the Sea medallion.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.588
- Soon it will be mine.
- Miss me?

20:13.796 --> 20:14.968
Aah!

20:15.172 --> 20:18.096
I wish you'd stop doing that!

20:18.300 --> 20:21.930
He, he. Me too.
But I don't think I can.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.811
Well? Did you find Scylla?

20:25.015 --> 20:28.019
I did, and she agreed to do it.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.945
Excellent.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.899
And once she's poisoned
the king at the ball...

20:33.107 --> 20:36.486
then I will rise up
in righteous fury...

20:36.694 --> 20:38.696
and finish off the old hag.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.874
Presto, I'm hailed as
a national hero...

20:42.074 --> 20:46.750
and my son is crowned
king of Seagundia.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.958
My, you have thought of everything.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.419
I make it my business to.

20:52.626 --> 20:59.180
And once my son is king, I will wield
the real power in the kingdom.

20:59.383 --> 21:05.732
And now comes the hard part,
finding someone to marry him.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.808
Perhaps you should talk to Scylla.

21:08.017 --> 21:11.146
You know, she has
quite a lovely niece.

21:11.645 --> 21:12.897
Aah!

21:13.105 --> 21:14.277
Niece?

21:14.482 --> 21:18.703
Goodness me,
did I fail to mention that?

21:19.236 --> 21:22.456
Blond, about 17 years old.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.455
Interesting coincidence,
don't you think?

21:25.659 --> 21:26.785
What?

21:26.994 --> 21:29.873
I'm guessing that's a "yes."

21:30.080 --> 21:31.127
Murray...

21:31.916 --> 21:34.044
bring me that girl.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.424
I want to ask her a few questions.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.597
Ha-ha-ha. Uh-huh.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.222
Hmm.

21:49.350 --> 21:53.230
This forest goes on forever.

21:53.437 --> 21:54.814
And it's getting kind of dark.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.535
Hey. There!

22:02.279 --> 22:03.496
Quick, after him!

22:16.961 --> 22:18.008
Lights?

22:18.212 --> 22:19.885
The city.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.933
Lumina, wait up!

22:25.594 --> 22:27.892
- Whoa.
- Aah!

22:34.895 --> 22:36.488
Huh?

23:00.337 --> 23:02.055
Oh, no.

23:08.429 --> 23:09.772
Aah!

23:12.016 --> 23:14.610
Oh, no. Aah!

23:16.812 --> 23:19.656
Uh, Lumina?

23:24.111 --> 23:25.203
Huh?

23:27.323 --> 23:30.167
Move away from the rock.

23:30.701 --> 23:31.827
What?

23:32.036 --> 23:35.290
Move away from the rock.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.003
Why?

23:42.087 --> 23:43.430
Huh?

23:45.174 --> 23:46.676
That's why.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.010
A stonefish.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.141
One of the most poisonous...

23:50.346 --> 23:52.098
The most poisonous!

23:52.306 --> 23:55.776
Make that the most
poisonous fish in the sea.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.153
That's right, lady.

23:58.354 --> 24:01.028
You are looking at the
face of certain doom!

24:01.231 --> 24:03.108
Nice to meet you, Mr. Doom.

24:03.317 --> 24:06.070
That is one powerful
voice you have.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.786
Aren't you gonna move it?

24:10.908 --> 24:12.751
I vote with him.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.329
Aren't you listening?

24:17.581 --> 24:22.963
Each one of my poisonous spikes
means a terrible, horrible end.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.881
Hmm.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.188
There. Much prettier.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.941
Hmm? Huh?

24:40.145 --> 24:43.115
What? What have you done to me?

24:44.441 --> 24:47.035
Yeah, what have you done to him?

24:47.236 --> 24:48.988
I just de-spiked your spikes.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.948
Now no one needs to
be scared of you.

24:51.156 --> 24:54.376
Oh. Great.

24:54.785 --> 24:56.253
Just great.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.672
Now what am I supposed to do?

24:58.872 --> 24:59.919
Just be nicer.

25:00.124 --> 25:01.751
Stop trying to frighten everyone.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.302
Get to know your fellow fish.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.595
Easy for you to say.

25:05.796 --> 25:08.049
But everyone runs from me.

25:08.257 --> 25:11.477
Once no one's afraid of you,
I bet you'll have loads of friends.

25:11.677 --> 25:12.724
I don't know.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.976
It all seems wrong for a stonefish.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.683
And I'm not so good
at friendliness.

25:17.891 --> 25:20.861
We're heading to the city.
There's lots of fish there, Mr. Doom.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.610
You could practise being
friendly on them.

25:24.898 --> 25:26.992
The name's Spike.

25:27.192 --> 25:30.822
- You don't mind me coming along?
- I'd be honoured.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.533
And I'd be nervous.

25:33.741 --> 25:36.244
But I'll give it a shot.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.227
Candygram!

25:54.511 --> 25:56.309
Eel Scout cookies!

26:06.523 --> 26:08.321
Aha.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.573
Garth, Wormwood.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.714
Let's go.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.173
Huh?

26:31.799 --> 26:33.096
Hmm.

26:35.177 --> 26:36.349
"Aunt Scylla.

26:36.553 --> 26:40.649
You left behind your invitation,
so we're bringing it to you.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.226
See you at the castle.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.152
Love, Lumina." Hmm.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.234
Victims...

26:47.439 --> 26:49.487
never there when you need them.

26:49.691 --> 26:52.365
As long as I'm here...

26:58.909 --> 27:00.161
Uh-uh.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.257
- Ha.
- Ooh. He-he-he.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.558
- Ooh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.510
- Ha.
- Unh.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.436
Oh.

27:18.929 --> 27:20.522
Hmm.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.274
Ooh.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.022
Well, well, well.

27:25.227 --> 27:27.446
Hello.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.156
And the remora said:

27:33.360 --> 27:36.785
"I don't have to outswim the shark.
I just need to outswim you."

27:39.741 --> 27:41.288
Huh?

27:42.661 --> 27:44.914
Aah. Help! Kelp!

27:45.122 --> 27:46.715
- Help!
- Are you yelling "kelp"?

27:46.915 --> 27:48.337
Or "help"?

27:48.542 --> 27:51.136
Whoa. She swam right
into a bed of snarly kelp.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.555
That stuff never lets go.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.056
Spike, quick!

28:06.518 --> 28:07.565
Aah!

28:11.273 --> 28:12.320
Hold still.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.822
You gotta hold still.

28:27.497 --> 28:28.544
Scylla was right.

28:28.749 --> 28:31.127
We'll never make it in
one piece to the... Huh?

28:31.335 --> 28:32.382
Aah!

28:33.754 --> 28:35.301
The castle.

28:35.505 --> 28:38.224
Whoa.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.444
- Aah.
- Ooh.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.446
Ooh.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.087
Whoa.

29:12.292 --> 29:16.593
Look at the pretty dresses,
Kuda. Ooh.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.725
Huh?

29:22.844 --> 29:25.472
Hey, out of the way!

29:29.268 --> 29:31.362
- Sorry! Unh.
- Hah!

29:31.561 --> 29:33.939
- Excuse me.
- Tourists.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.696
Boy, everyone's in
such a big hurry.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.073
Where did Spike go?

29:42.990 --> 29:45.869
Spike, will you please stop hiding?

29:46.076 --> 29:48.374
You have nothing to worry about.

29:48.870 --> 29:53.000
Okay. But now you're gonna hear
some real yelling and screaming.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.758
Hey, love your pearls.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.547
You do?

29:58.755 --> 30:02.259
Oh, yeah. Great look.

30:02.968 --> 30:07.189
That colour is great on you.

30:14.521 --> 30:15.943
Lumina, look.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.025
It's your Aunt Scylla.

30:18.233 --> 30:19.951
But we don't have the invitation.

30:20.277 --> 30:22.746
Oh, no, she's never
gonna believe us.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.948
She'll be angry we left the reef.

30:25.157 --> 30:28.252
Well, I'll just explain that we
were trying to help out and...

30:28.452 --> 30:30.204
And you'll be grounded for a year.

30:30.579 --> 30:31.671
Come on.

30:31.872 --> 30:33.624
Wait. What about Spike?

30:34.791 --> 30:35.838
He's doing fine.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.008
Quick. In here.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.763
Oh, thank goodness.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.814
This way, sweetie. I'll get you set up.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.484
But I think you must
have the wrong...

30:52.684 --> 30:55.244
So do y'all have references?
Do you have a resume?

30:55.437 --> 30:59.112
Do you have a hairpin?
Because my bun's coming undone.

30:59.316 --> 31:01.193
Can I get you a refreshment?

31:01.401 --> 31:02.527
Oh, Madame Ruckus.

31:02.736 --> 31:05.740
Now, are you sure this blush
is right for the royal ball?

31:05.947 --> 31:09.497
Trust me, honey,
that colour is you.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.714
That'll be 52.95, sugar.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.503
Shampoo!

31:15.916 --> 31:17.714
Heads up!

31:19.086 --> 31:20.133
Huh? Unh.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.226
Now, let's see what y'all can do.

31:28.929 --> 31:30.021
About what?

31:31.640 --> 31:32.983
Hang on, sugar.

31:33.183 --> 31:35.277
Salon Du Mer.
Madame Ruckus speaking.

31:35.477 --> 31:39.402
Uh-huh. You bet, ma'am.
We can squeeze y'all in before the ball.

31:39.606 --> 31:42.200
Well, of course your eyes
are all puffy, sugar.

31:42.401 --> 31:47.908
You need to put sea cucumbers
on them every Tuesday. Mm-hm.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.207
- Bye-bye.
- Huh?

31:50.826 --> 31:52.954
Salon Du Mer.
Madame Ruckus speaking.

31:53.161 --> 31:56.836
Oh, I'm so sorry, we're completely
booked on the Saturday.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.713
- Why, certainly.
- Oh, Madame Ruckus.

31:59.084 --> 32:03.089
Hang on, honey, I can only
do eight things at once.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.305
Lumina, this is our
chance to leave.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.683
Oh, Scylla's coming.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.764
Uh, disguise hair.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.418
- Whew.
- Argh.

32:33.618 --> 32:34.665
That was close.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.122
Wow.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.797
You got the job.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.045
A job?

32:39.249 --> 32:41.092
I have a job.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.842
Uh, what's a job?

32:44.045 --> 32:47.470
But tell your friend the
wig's not a good look.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.221
Huh?

32:50.802 --> 32:51.928
Aah!

32:52.137 --> 32:54.515
And here's your first customer.

32:54.723 --> 32:57.192
Lunch break's at 1, we close at 5.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.861
By the way, what's your name, hon?

33:00.020 --> 33:03.069
Uh... It's Lumina.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.235
Okay, Scylla's gone.

33:06.443 --> 33:08.571
Let's get out of here.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.371
But I have a customer.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.415
Remember the royal castle?

33:12.616 --> 33:15.335
The reason we came
here in the first place?

33:15.535 --> 33:17.708
You're right. But she needs me.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.256
Just look.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.172
We'll leave right after this, Kuda.

33:23.376 --> 33:27.097
Isn't it exciting? My first job.

33:27.631 --> 33:29.804
So you're the new stylist, huh?

33:30.008 --> 33:31.976
Well, newbie, I got two rules:

33:32.177 --> 33:36.728
Keep your hands out of my tip jar, and
don't ever touch my lucky brush, okay?

33:36.932 --> 33:38.855
Tip jar?

33:39.059 --> 33:40.561
Don't let her scare you, honey.

33:40.769 --> 33:41.861
That's Sandrine...

33:42.062 --> 33:44.281
and she's half barracuda. Ha, ha.

33:44.481 --> 33:45.653
And this is Cora.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.484
She does nails and tails.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.320
Hi. I'm Lumina.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.202
This is my friend Kuda.

33:52.405 --> 33:54.783
Hi. We're just passing through.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.369
Well, it's nice to meet you anyway.

33:57.577 --> 33:58.624
Whoo, I am beat.

34:02.666 --> 34:04.168
Salon Du Mer.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.550
Of course. When would y'all
like to come in, ma'am?

34:07.754 --> 34:09.427
Got it. Mm-hm.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.850
Can you do my hair like her?

34:12.050 --> 34:13.848
Well, okay, if you want.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.601
But you know what might
look even better on you?

34:16.804 --> 34:18.148
I wanna look like her.

34:18.348 --> 34:19.600
Piece of advice, newbie.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.185
Just give them what they want.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.987
Trust me, they're all
wearing the same hairstyle.

34:29.818 --> 34:32.286
Certainly, certainly. Mm-hm.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.121
Lumina. No.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.793
Hmm. Let me see your eyes.

34:58.179 --> 35:02.184
That is so totally awesome!

35:02.392 --> 35:03.769
I knew you'd like it.

35:03.977 --> 35:05.103
Like it?

35:05.312 --> 35:07.610
I love it!

35:09.107 --> 35:11.187
- Isn't that different!
- It's wonderful.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.828
- I want something like that!
- I can't believe it.

35:14.404 --> 35:15.781
Thank you.

35:15.989 --> 35:18.117
You're welcome.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.420
Ugh. Okay, so you got lucky.
Nobody saw that.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.748
- Now can we go?
- Next.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.917
I want my hair just
like you did hers.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.172
Are you sure?

35:28.376 --> 35:30.799
How about something
special, just for you?

35:31.004 --> 35:32.051
Really?

35:39.095 --> 35:41.018
Have you briefed the
men about the ball?

35:41.222 --> 35:45.523
Yes, sir. Don't worry,
they know exactly what to do.

35:45.727 --> 35:48.025
Splendid.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.245
Everything is arranged.

36:03.453 --> 36:06.457
The rest is up to you.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.049
You will take the steward's
place at the ball...

36:12.253 --> 36:15.257
and serve the merberry
nectar to the royal party...

36:15.465 --> 36:18.014
including His Majesty.

36:19.344 --> 36:22.769
The king will present the
Pearl of the Sea to my son...

36:22.972 --> 36:25.350
then drink the toast...

36:25.558 --> 36:26.980
then die.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.732
I have what you need.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.941
All that remains is
to mix the brew.

36:32.148 --> 36:35.243
You rid me of one pest
many years ago...

36:35.443 --> 36:38.413
now you'll rid me of another.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.752
Oh, by the way...

36:43.952 --> 36:47.081
I understand you have a niece.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.504
I have a goldfish too. What of it?

36:50.709 --> 36:55.806
Please, give my regards
to both of them.

37:03.888 --> 37:07.188
That is amazing.

37:18.153 --> 37:22.283
Kuda, I'm gonna need
a lot more pearls.

37:23.032 --> 37:24.659
Huh?

37:25.952 --> 37:27.204
More pearls, more pearls.

37:27.412 --> 37:28.789
Always more pearls.

37:28.997 --> 37:32.718
Are you sure you can make
my hair look like hers?

37:32.917 --> 37:34.134
Yeah, yeah, no worries.

37:34.335 --> 37:37.054
I could do that style in my sleep.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.384
You know, I've got an idea.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.265
How about I try something new?

37:42.469 --> 37:44.142
A little different?

37:44.345 --> 37:45.562
- Oh. No, no, I want...
- Hey.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.233
If she can do something
different, so can I.

37:48.433 --> 37:52.108
- But I wanted...
- And you're gonna love it, understand?

37:52.312 --> 37:54.155
Uh, okay.

37:57.484 --> 37:58.861
What?

37:59.068 --> 38:00.194
Oh, look.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.538
Baby dolphins.

38:02.739 --> 38:04.207
That is so cute.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.250
I didn't even know
you could do that.

38:07.702 --> 38:10.330
I never tried it before.

38:11.873 --> 38:15.594
They're gone?
What do you mean she's gone?

38:15.794 --> 38:16.841
You know, gone.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.844
Vanished, abracadabra.
Now she's here, now she's not.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.300
The place was empty.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.306
Blast!

38:23.510 --> 38:27.390
Hmm. Someone must
have tipped her off.

38:27.597 --> 38:28.644
I don't think so.

38:28.848 --> 38:31.772
She left a note saying she
was coming to the city.

38:31.976 --> 38:35.651
- And I found this.
- Hmm.

38:36.523 --> 38:38.776
The royal crest.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.319
Then it is her.

38:41.528 --> 38:45.533
That old hag double-crossed me.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.868
The princess is alive.

38:48.076 --> 38:50.044
And yet you don't seem overjoyed.

38:50.245 --> 38:51.872
This could ruin everything.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.253
We've got to get rid of her.

38:54.457 --> 38:55.754
Search high and low.

38:55.959 --> 39:01.432
Get all your slimiest, sleaziest,
creepiest cronies together.

39:01.589 --> 39:04.058
Heh-heh.
That's the only kind I know.

39:04.259 --> 39:07.433
And find that girl!

39:11.599 --> 39:14.318
I can't seem to make heads
or tails of this map, Dolphin.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.985
Ah. Perhaps this good woman
can be of some assistance.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.744
- Excuse me, ma'am, but could you...?
- Why, thanks. You're a doll.

39:26.948 --> 39:30.373
Just plop them down inside.
I'll grab some more.

39:35.415 --> 39:37.543
Finally, the delivery's here.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.048
Did you bring some styling gel?

39:40.253 --> 39:41.300
Uh...

39:41.504 --> 39:42.801
Styling gel?

39:43.006 --> 39:44.508
Aha! Here it is.

39:44.716 --> 39:48.562
Sorry, heh-heh-heh,
I'm afraid I'm a bit new to all this.

39:48.761 --> 39:51.731
It's okay.
This is my first job too.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.649
I'm Lumina.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.227
Pleasure to meet you, Lumina.

39:55.435 --> 39:58.188
- I'm Delphin.
- Dolphin?

40:00.356 --> 40:02.324
Now, now, how would she know?

40:02.525 --> 40:03.902
We've just met.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.453
It's Delphin.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.200
We get that a lot.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.129
I hope to see you again.

40:16.581 --> 40:17.628
He's handsome.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.051
Well, aren't you the lucky one?

40:20.668 --> 40:23.046
You're the new stylist in town?

40:24.589 --> 40:25.886
Yes, sir. Lumina.

40:26.090 --> 40:29.264
Whatever.
I hear you're a miracle worker.

40:29.469 --> 40:31.722
Can you do something with this?

40:33.598 --> 40:35.646
I'm sure I can.

40:35.850 --> 40:38.194
Good luck. You'd be the first.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.782
Is that a <i>Robena grandiflora?</i>

40:42.982 --> 40:45.155
Hmm. I'm not sure.

40:45.360 --> 40:48.079
Hey, Cora,
what kind of plant is this?

40:48.279 --> 40:51.123
Um, green?

40:51.616 --> 40:55.120
Oh. She's beautiful.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.966
I'll introduce you when we're done.

41:07.507 --> 41:09.680
Ooh.

41:12.428 --> 41:13.725
Come on.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.318
Hello, I'm Fergie.

41:22.522 --> 41:23.774
I'm Cora.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.034
- Do you like plants?
- Um...

41:27.235 --> 41:28.987
- I have a fern.
- You do?

41:29.195 --> 41:32.620
Have you ever tried feeding it a
mix of bone meal and phosphorus?

41:32.824 --> 41:35.247
It'll do wonders for the seedlings.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.374
Heh-heh. I'll give it a try.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.586
Fergie.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.550
Ladies, hold onto your hairpins.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.973
I've got bodacious news.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.801
I just ran into a dear old
friend on the royal staff...

41:52.010 --> 41:53.557
and guess what she gave me.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.139
- An invitation?
- To the royal ball?

41:56.347 --> 41:59.066
- Tonight?
- For the whole salon staff.

42:02.353 --> 42:06.483
I found more pearls, but I
didn't have time to unwrap them.

42:07.567 --> 42:09.911
Kuda. The royal ball.

42:10.111 --> 42:11.533
At the castle.

42:11.738 --> 42:13.866
- Oh, no.
- This is terrible.

42:14.073 --> 42:15.199
It is?

42:15.408 --> 42:17.661
- What are we gonna wear?
- What are we gonna wear?

42:20.663 --> 42:23.542
<i>Splish, splash, the water's perfect</i>

42:24.042 --> 42:27.387
<i>You, me, and the deep blue sea</i>

42:27.837 --> 42:30.932
<i>Tails in the air like you just don't care</i>

42:31.132 --> 42:33.430
<i>It's an underwater fantasy</i>

42:33.968 --> 42:35.015
<i>Yeah</i>

42:35.219 --> 42:38.018
<i>Splish, splash, the water's perfect</i>

42:39.098 --> 42:41.066
<i>You, me, and the deep blue sea</i>

42:42.852 --> 42:45.901
<i>Tails in the air like you just don't care</i>

42:46.105 --> 42:50.281
<i>Yeah, yeah, it's a mermaid party</i>

42:50.860 --> 42:54.034
<i>It's a mermaid party</i>

42:54.614 --> 42:57.083
<i>Mermaid party</i>

42:58.326 --> 43:00.670
<i>It's a mermaid party</i>

43:03.748 --> 43:07.298
<i>Bubble up
'Cause tonight will be a good night</i>

43:07.502 --> 43:09.425
<i>Everyone's swimming through</i>

43:11.089 --> 43:14.764
<i>Spin around, change your gown
The future's so bright</i>

43:14.967 --> 43:18.187
<i>You know that's how we do</i>

43:18.513 --> 43:20.436
<i>Everybody 'round the world</i>

43:20.640 --> 43:22.142
<i>All my girls, grab your pearls</i>

43:22.350 --> 43:24.148
<i>Let me hear you singing, yeah</i>

43:24.352 --> 43:25.774
<i>Yeah</i>

43:25.978 --> 43:27.901
<i>Everybody 'round the world</i>

43:28.106 --> 43:29.779
<i>All my girls, grab your pearls</i>

43:29.982 --> 43:31.655
<i>Let me hear you singing, yeah</i>

43:31.859 --> 43:33.782
<i>Yeah</i>

43:35.238 --> 43:38.617
<i>Splish, splash, the water's perfect</i>

43:39.075 --> 43:42.329
<i>You, me, and the deep blue sea</i>

43:42.829 --> 43:45.332
<i>Tails in the air like you just don't care</i>

43:45.540 --> 43:47.133
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

43:47.333 --> 43:48.676
<i>It's a mermaid party</i>

43:49.085 --> 43:50.928
<i>Put your fins up</i>

43:51.129 --> 43:52.972
<i>It's a mermaid party</i>

43:53.172 --> 43:54.845
<i>Party, party down</i>

43:55.049 --> 43:56.471
<i>It's a mermaid party</i>

43:56.676 --> 43:58.144
<i>Put your fins up</i>

43:58.344 --> 44:00.438
<i>It's a mermaid party</i>

44:00.638 --> 44:02.356
<i>Party, party down</i>

44:02.557 --> 44:03.854
<i>It's a mermaid party</i>

44:04.058 --> 44:05.901
<i>Everybody 'round the world
All my girls</i>

44:06.102 --> 44:07.900
<i>- It's a mermaid party
- Grab your pearls</i>

44:08.104 --> 44:10.027
<i>- Let me hear you singing, yeah
- Yeah</i>

44:10.231 --> 44:12.905
<i>- Mermaid party
- Everybody 'round the world</i>

44:13.109 --> 44:15.532
<i>- All my girls, grab your pearls
- It's a mermaid party</i>

44:15.736 --> 44:19.081
<i>Let me hear you singing, yeah
Party, party down</i>

44:21.325 --> 44:24.374
<i>Come to the party</i>

44:31.836 --> 44:35.010
Yoo-hoo. Cora.

44:38.134 --> 44:40.262
Heh-heh-heh. Aah!

44:40.678 --> 44:43.648
The <i>Robena grandiflora.</i>

44:44.015 --> 44:45.562
It's radiant.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.609
And so are you.

44:47.810 --> 44:50.689
Well, thank you, Fergie.

44:52.481 --> 44:54.575
I wore a flower too.

44:54.775 --> 44:56.448
- It's a sulphur lily.
- Fergie.

44:57.195 --> 44:58.742
Why aren't you dancing?

44:58.946 --> 45:01.415
You're supposed to be finding a bride.

45:01.616 --> 45:05.837
I've tried, Father. Really, I have.
But no one will dance with me.

45:06.037 --> 45:09.007
They mostly swim away
screaming when I get near.

45:10.458 --> 45:11.505
Shoo.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.336
Oh. No wonder.

45:13.753 --> 45:16.802
What is that stink?

45:17.006 --> 45:19.384
Oh, that's my <i>Quidest fetere.</i>

45:19.592 --> 45:20.969
It's quite rare, you know.

45:21.177 --> 45:24.101
In fact, you can only find
it in the coral reefs.

45:24.305 --> 45:26.148
Well, lose it.

45:26.349 --> 45:28.568
Now get out there and dance.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.534
Does he always speak
to you that way?

45:36.734 --> 45:37.986
What Way?

45:38.194 --> 45:39.411
Oh, there's the music.

45:39.612 --> 45:41.990
Excuse me, Father says
I have to go dance.

45:42.198 --> 45:45.577
Well... You know, I like to dance.

45:45.785 --> 45:47.458
Really?

45:48.371 --> 45:49.463
You wouldn't mind?

45:49.664 --> 45:52.463
And I thought your
flower was beautiful.

45:52.667 --> 45:53.793
I know.

45:54.001 --> 45:56.379
Wasn't it awesome?

45:57.964 --> 46:02.686
And Their Majesties will be drinking
the merberry nectar reserve tonight.

46:07.640 --> 46:11.520
And the clam said, "I couldn't play
because I pulled a muscle."

46:16.649 --> 46:18.276
Hey.

46:22.530 --> 46:23.998
Narwhal.

46:24.365 --> 46:25.412
Unh.

46:25.616 --> 46:28.620
Miss Lumina, welcome.

46:28.828 --> 46:32.628
I must thank you. You did
absolute wonders with Fergie.

46:32.957 --> 46:35.301
I almost didn't recognise him.

46:40.131 --> 46:45.638
- Then, sadly, I did.
- Uh... You're welcome.

46:45.845 --> 46:48.018
Excuse me, General Caligo.

46:48.222 --> 46:49.940
I call the first dance.

46:50.141 --> 46:53.020
Of course, Prince Dolphin.

46:54.478 --> 46:56.071
- It's Delphin.
- Whatever.

46:56.272 --> 46:58.070
Prince Delphin?

46:58.274 --> 47:00.823
And you deliver hair supplies too?

47:01.027 --> 47:02.904
It's more of a hobby
than anything else...

47:03.112 --> 47:05.991
when not performing
my more princely duties.

47:06.407 --> 47:07.954
You're joking, right?

47:11.620 --> 47:12.837
And what about you?

47:13.039 --> 47:15.838
Hairstylist by day,
princess by night?

47:16.208 --> 47:17.300
Princess?

47:17.501 --> 47:18.718
Who me?

47:18.919 --> 47:21.138
I'm the furthest thing
from a princess.

47:21.339 --> 47:22.511
Now who's joking?

47:24.383 --> 47:25.430
Dolphin, right?

47:25.634 --> 47:26.931
I'm Kuda. Heh.

47:30.306 --> 47:32.149
You don't say much, do you?

47:36.604 --> 47:38.106
Huh.

47:41.317 --> 47:43.069
Finally.

47:43.277 --> 47:45.905
Had that sardine stuck
in my throat for weeks.

47:46.113 --> 47:47.786
I'm sorry. Now what
were you saying?

47:54.872 --> 47:55.998
- Whoo!
- Aah!

47:56.207 --> 47:57.709
Would you not?

47:59.293 --> 48:00.340
Sorry.

48:00.544 --> 48:03.093
- Everything going as planned?
- Like clockwork.

48:03.297 --> 48:05.800
Their Majesties will grace
us with their presence...

48:06.008 --> 48:07.180
15 minutes from now...

48:07.385 --> 48:10.514
for what will be the
king's final appearance.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.268
What about the girl?

48:12.473 --> 48:13.599
We're zeroing in.

48:13.808 --> 48:15.310
Every crawly creature in town...

48:15.518 --> 48:18.897
is now looking for a 17-year-old
blond girl named Lumina.

48:19.522 --> 48:22.446
Don't worry, we'll get her.

48:24.193 --> 48:25.820
Named what?

48:27.363 --> 48:28.535
Lumina.

48:28.739 --> 48:31.037
It was on her note.

48:31.242 --> 48:33.586
Is that her?

48:36.163 --> 48:39.463
Why, yes, so it would seem.

48:40.251 --> 48:42.629
Dancing in the castle.

48:42.837 --> 48:44.589
I never would have believed it.

48:44.797 --> 48:47.846
You dance as if you've
done it a hundred times.

48:49.510 --> 48:52.184
- Thank you.
- I'll get us some refreshments.

48:52.388 --> 48:53.480
Promise me the next dance?

48:54.932 --> 48:56.900
I promise.

48:58.436 --> 49:02.316
Oh, General Caligo. I already promised
Prince Delphin the next dance.

49:02.648 --> 49:05.322
But I can dance with
you after that.

49:05.526 --> 49:07.199
Huh?

49:08.737 --> 49:13.413
Tell me, Miss Lumina,
are you here with your parents?

49:13.617 --> 49:15.164
My parents?

49:15.369 --> 49:17.463
Actually, I was raised by my aunt.

49:17.663 --> 49:19.916
Hmm. I see.

49:20.374 --> 49:24.345
One of life's little secrets.

49:26.154 --> 49:30.851
Some secrets are best
kept under wraps.

49:33.596 --> 49:35.348
Hey! What do you
guys think you're...?

49:35.556 --> 49:36.853
No witnesses.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.526
Yikes!

49:42.229 --> 49:44.732
Unh. Oh.

49:48.944 --> 49:51.038
Where do you want them?

49:51.655 --> 49:53.578
The castle dungeon.

49:53.782 --> 49:57.787
This time, I'm going to make
sure the job is done right.

50:08.464 --> 50:09.511
He's cute.

50:09.715 --> 50:11.058
Ha!

50:16.597 --> 50:21.398
Ah. Get out of my way,
you oversized pincushion.

50:22.436 --> 50:24.234
Well, excuse me.

50:24.855 --> 50:27.825
I wouldn't want you to
be poisoned. Yeesh.

50:28.734 --> 50:30.202
Poison?

50:30.694 --> 50:32.947
What do you know about the poison?

50:33.155 --> 50:36.500
You were almost skewered
by my poisonous spikes.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.708
Oh.

50:40.371 --> 50:44.922
Holy mackerel, somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the seabed. Argh.

50:49.505 --> 50:50.631
Argh.

50:50.839 --> 50:52.432
Haven't eels ever
heard of mouthwash?

50:56.387 --> 50:58.731
What do you want with us?

51:01.600 --> 51:04.069
Patience. Patience, my dear.

51:04.270 --> 51:06.068
You'll find out soon enough.

51:07.898 --> 51:11.744
Wait. I remember you,
from the reef.

51:11.944 --> 51:13.867
Aren't you a friend of my aunt?

51:14.071 --> 51:16.540
Oh, I'd hardly say a "friend."

51:16.740 --> 51:20.461
Your aunt and I are more
business associates.

51:22.288 --> 51:25.212
Uh, what kind of business?

51:25.416 --> 51:29.296
- We're exterminators of a sort.
- Aah!

51:29.503 --> 51:34.555
Yeah. And in five minutes, your
aunt's gonna exterminate the king.

51:34.758 --> 51:37.386
Right. She's gonna poisonate him.

51:40.222 --> 51:41.314
Hey. Ow!

51:41.515 --> 51:42.812
That's crazy.

51:43.017 --> 51:45.611
Aunt Scylla would never
poison anyone.

51:45.811 --> 51:48.155
Uh-huh.

52:13.047 --> 52:15.846
I see you got stuck dancing
with Fergie. Sorry.

52:16.050 --> 52:19.270
I don't know.
I think he's kind of sweet.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.268
Oh, really?

52:21.472 --> 52:22.519
Where's Lumina?

52:22.723 --> 52:26.853
She's probably fawning over the
tablecloths or sconces or something.

52:27.061 --> 52:29.359
Lumina, what are we gonna do?

52:29.897 --> 52:31.194
Hmm.

52:37.905 --> 52:40.454
Ha, bribery. Good thinking.

52:40.658 --> 52:43.662
Not exactly.

52:54.088 --> 52:55.840
- May I have another card, please?
- Go.

52:56.048 --> 52:58.722
"May I have another card?"
Thank you for asking politely.

52:58.926 --> 53:02.396
- Nope, it's my turn right now.
- Huh?

53:04.890 --> 53:06.483
Hmm.

53:14.566 --> 53:16.068
Everything ready, captain?

53:16.276 --> 53:18.028
Just awaiting your word, sir.

53:18.237 --> 53:20.740
Excellent.

53:26.161 --> 53:28.129
Did you see, Father? Did you see?

53:28.330 --> 53:31.379
I was dancing with a real girl.

53:31.583 --> 53:35.713
Good.
I'm thrilled it wasn't a plant.

53:36.964 --> 53:39.137
Heh-heh-heh. Hit me.

53:39.717 --> 53:41.390
- Hit me.
- I don't want to hit you.

53:41.593 --> 53:42.810
I want to play cards.

53:43.011 --> 53:45.730
Please just ante up.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.734
- Aah.
- Huh?

53:53.522 --> 53:55.115
Nah.

53:55.691 --> 53:57.614
Phew.

53:58.569 --> 54:00.071
- Hit me.
- I'm gonna hit him...

54:00.279 --> 54:01.872
if he says hit me one more time.

54:02.072 --> 54:05.042
- Hit me.
- No, no one's hitting each other.

54:08.579 --> 54:09.831
- Give me three.
- Okay, three.

54:10.038 --> 54:14.839
Oh. Now what? How do we
distract the Noodle Brothers?

54:19.882 --> 54:21.930
Hey! What did you do that for?

54:22.134 --> 54:24.182
Do what? I didn't do nothing.

54:25.012 --> 54:26.355
Ow!

54:26.555 --> 54:27.681
Have you lost your mind?

54:27.890 --> 54:31.520
- No, I swear. He must've done it.
- Did not.

54:31.769 --> 54:34.488
- You started it.
- Cut that out.

54:34.688 --> 54:35.985
- You hit me first.
- Did not.

54:36.190 --> 54:38.443
- Did too.
- Yes, you did.

54:38.776 --> 54:40.699
- Hey.
- What?

54:46.325 --> 54:47.542
Shall we?

54:47.743 --> 54:48.835
Let's.

54:49.036 --> 54:51.755
Grab them!

54:52.623 --> 54:54.876
That way, you idiots. All together.

54:55.083 --> 54:57.085
One, two, three. One, two, three.

54:59.171 --> 55:02.516
Uh, is it too late to make a deal?

55:08.472 --> 55:11.772
Your nectar for the toast, sir.

55:25.989 --> 55:27.741
Mm-hm.

55:44.174 --> 55:48.179
You don't believe what those slimeball
eels said about Scylla, do you?

55:48.929 --> 55:50.306
I don't know what to believe.

55:50.514 --> 55:53.518
But if Aunt Scylla's in some kind
of trouble, we've got to help her.

55:53.725 --> 55:55.227
Whoa!

56:03.277 --> 56:05.200
Halt!

56:10.951 --> 56:13.170
Full speed ahead.

56:18.584 --> 56:21.383
I know, Lorelei, I know.

56:21.920 --> 56:25.220
We wanted so much for the
Pearl of the Sea and the kingdom...

56:25.424 --> 56:29.224
to someday go to our little girl.

56:29.469 --> 56:31.517
Try to be brave.

56:32.931 --> 56:36.231
Come, come, woman. You can't
hold on to things forever.

56:36.435 --> 56:38.904
That belongs to the king and queen.

56:39.104 --> 56:41.106
What? What did you say?

56:41.315 --> 56:44.444
The nectar.
You should be serving it.

56:44.651 --> 56:48.121
Oh, yes, you're right.

56:48.322 --> 56:51.201
You're very right.

56:55.078 --> 56:58.002
Give me that, Caligo.
I'm done poisoning people.

56:58.206 --> 57:00.584
Aha. So I was right.

57:00.792 --> 57:05.548
No, thanks. I'll just hang on
to this one, if you don't mind.

57:05.756 --> 57:08.054
Caligo, I'm trying to save your...

57:08.258 --> 57:10.977
Oh, I know what
you're trying to do.

57:11.178 --> 57:13.306
You think I'm a fool?

57:13.513 --> 57:16.187
Fine. It's your funeral.

57:16.558 --> 57:19.983
She thinks she can outsmart me.

57:20.187 --> 57:23.942
Unless that's just what
she wants me to think.

57:50.342 --> 57:53.016
Loyal citizens of Seagundia...

57:53.220 --> 57:57.691
we gather today to present our
kingdom's most treasured symbol...

57:57.891 --> 57:59.564
the Pearl of the Sea...

58:00.978 --> 58:05.529
to a fine young lad who will
one day inherit our throne.

58:08.318 --> 58:09.365
Ugh.

58:09.569 --> 58:11.571
Oh, right.

58:20.664 --> 58:22.132
Quick. This way.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.388
Oh, no.

58:32.884 --> 58:34.261
Aah!

58:48.442 --> 58:51.992
Caligo, is this my cup?

58:55.615 --> 58:58.459
And now a toast.

58:59.995 --> 59:04.375
Come, Caligo, will you not
toast your own son?

59:04.583 --> 59:07.382
Oh, uh, yes.

59:07.586 --> 59:09.554
Of course.

59:09.963 --> 59:12.182
Citizens, honoured guests.

59:13.800 --> 59:17.020
To the future ruler of Seagundia...

59:17.220 --> 59:20.941
who will someday guide
our kingdom's destiny.

59:21.141 --> 59:26.773
To my nephew, our dear brother-in-law
Caligo's pride and joy...

59:26.980 --> 59:31.110
his only son and heir
and our next monarch.

59:31.318 --> 59:32.615
To Fergie.

59:33.028 --> 59:35.656
To Fergie!

59:39.868 --> 59:41.962
Oh, forgive me. I'm so sorry.

59:42.162 --> 59:45.166
Please, Your Majesty, take mine.

59:45.582 --> 59:48.256
- Aah.
- Of course. Think nothing of it.

59:48.585 --> 59:51.384
Aah! No!

59:57.677 --> 59:59.350
Oh, no.

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:04.693
Aunt Scylla.

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.487
The eels were right.

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:15.533
Again, let us toast to Fergie.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.250
Lumina?

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:26.498
- What are you doing?
- What's happening?

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:29.172
She tried to attack the king.

01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:32.220
Guards, arrest her.

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:35.465
- You can't take her.
- Yeah, she's never even hurt a krill.

01:00:35.674 --> 01:00:37.176
You take your hands off of her.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:38.893
Let her go.

01:00:39.094 --> 01:00:40.971
She saved the king.

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:42.431
There was poison in his cup.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.276
Poison?

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:47.773
How do you know that?

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:53.030
Because I'm the one
who put it there.

01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:56.786
No. Don't listen to her.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:00.874
Why on earth would you
want to poison me?

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.335
I didn't want to.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:04.627
I was forced to.

01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:07.915
Forced to by...

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.508
Aah!

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.096
- Oh, no.
- Aunt Scylla!

01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:18.178
- Oh, no.
- Will she be all right?

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:19.741
What happened to her?

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:21.223
She fell on a stonefish spike.

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:25.274
Poor woman. That stonefish
venom will finish her for sure.

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:26.690
What have I done?

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:29.236
You all heard the old crone.

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:33.066
She tried to poison
our beloved king.

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:37.244
And if this girl knew,
she must be an accomplice.

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:38.536
Take her away.

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:43.375
Please, sir, just give us a moment.

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.206
Back off!

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:49.672
Mm-mm.

01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:53.131
The lady said to give her a moment.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:56.054
Don't make me ink you.

01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:59.133
Uh, sure. Uh, no problem.

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:02.098
Aunt Scylla, please stay with me.

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:03.804
Please be all right.

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:07.858
Lumina, I need to tell you.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.356
Shh. Save your strength.

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:15.653
Long ago,
I took you from your parents.

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:18.944
I did it to protect you.

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:23.373
But all these years,
they were suffering.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.575
I should have told them...

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:28.628
but I was afraid of losing you.

01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:32.002
Please forgive me.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:37.717
Spike, your venom,
there must be an antidote.

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:39.468
Something that can cure her.

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:40.890
I'm sorry.

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:43.640
There's only one thing I
know of: the sulphur lily.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:46.517
But it's extremely rare.

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:48.223
I've never even see one.

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:51.355
Fergie, do you know that plant?

01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:54.817
No, I don't.

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:58.776
You heard the boy.
He said it's hopeless.

01:03:02.237 --> 01:03:04.535
No, Father, it isn't.

01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:09.207
The sulphur lily is the common name
for the <i>Quidest fetere.</i>

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:11.709
And there's one right here.

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:16.376
Thank you, Fergie.

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:19.087
All you need are two petals.

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:23.971
No!

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:26.928
Guards, grab her.

01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:37.315
Lumina, get out of here.

01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:32.828
Aunt Scylla, stay with me.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:39.713
Please stay.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.758
Aah. Lumina?

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:47.717
Aah. Aunt Scylla.

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:02.027
- Phew.
- Whoo! Ha, ha!

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:07.329
Your Majesty, what we've just seen
proves how dangerous these two are.

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:12.251
As commanding general, I insist on
placing them both under arrest.

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:15.086
It was him.

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:16.959
Caligo.

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:19.632
He's the one who ordered
me to poison Your Majesty.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:22.962
He wanted the throne
for his son now.

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:26.215
The old hag is delusional.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:28.346
I believe her, Your Majesty.

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:30.602
You fool.

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:32.179
You could have been king.

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:36.984
I keep telling you, Father,
I don't want to be king.

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:39.857
I want to be a botanist.

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:42.484
- Why, you...
- Oh, Fergie.

01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:54.202
The pearls, have you always
been able to do that?

01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:57.037
Sure. I guess. Why?

01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:04.587
Because you have the royal
gift, the pearl magic.

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.637
Is it possible?

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:10.183
Could you be our daughter?

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.557
She is.

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:15.638
I am?

01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:19.150
- Aah.
- But... But how?

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.068
Caligo, again.

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:26.947
Years ago, he paid me to do
away with your daughter.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.778
But I couldn't do it.

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:35.083
So I raised her instead,
away from him.

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:39.459
In that case,
I think this is Lumina's.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:21.831
Your Majesties,
I am so, so sorry...

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.666
keeping her from you
all these years.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.799
I thought I did it to protect her.

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:32.303
But the truth was
I just couldn't give her up.

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:35.477
The important thing
is she's here now.

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:39.977
Lumina, welcome home.

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:43.355
Home? You mean, the castle?

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.187
Here?

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:49.150
But it won't be home if Aunt Scylla
and Kuda aren't here with me.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:54.325
No, it wouldn't be right.

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:56.247
Of course it would.

01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:58.290
You're her family too.

01:08:03.454 --> 01:08:06.628
But this is still a royal ball,
is it not?

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:09.552
And now it's a homecoming as well.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:14.428
Ha, ha. Music, maestro, please.

01:08:23.474 --> 01:08:27.319
In that case, I believe you
owe me a dance, princess.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.397
As promised.

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:01.062
- Excuse me a moment, Dolphin.
- Of course.

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:02.354
I'll be right...

01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:03.788
<i>When I was younger yesterday</i>

01:10:05.118 --> 01:10:08.713
<i>Things were simple
Things were safe</i>

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.458
<i>I never dreamed that I could see</i>

01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:14.340
<i>A better life for you and me</i>

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:18.765
<i>Everyone told me to stay</i>

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:23.057
<i>I held my breath, I made the leap</i>

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:28.191
<i>Opened a door I'd never seen</i>

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:30.818
<i>I took a chance, I made it through</i>

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:33.692
<i>Now everything is coming true</i>

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:39.528
<i>And this is what it's like to be</i>

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:44.242
<i>Out of my shell, just like a pearl</i>

01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:49.171
<i>Luminous, rare
Light up the world</i>

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.338
<i>Riding the swell</i>

01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:54.008
<i>Still the same girl</i>

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:59.009
<i>Making things better,
better, better</i>

01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:03.263
<i>Light up the world</i>

01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:09.482
<i>Changing colours, making waves</i>

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:14.358
<i>Something new in every day</i>

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:16.865
<i>Wide awake, I live the dream</i>

01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:19.738
<i>Beneath the stars under the sea</i>

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:23.321
<i>And now the current carries me</i>

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:27.909
<i>Out of my shell, just like a pearl</i>

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:32.793
<i>Luminous, rare
Light up the world</i>

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:34.965
<i>Riding the swell</i>

01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:37.635
<i>Still the same girl</i>

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:42.466
<i>Making things better,
better, better</i>

01:11:42.673 --> 01:11:45.176
<i>Light up the world</i>

01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:49.730
<i>You know, make it your home</i>

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:52.150
<i>Come home</i>

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:55.229
<i>Light up the world</i>

01:11:55.436 --> 01:12:02.445
<i>And feel the glow</i>

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:07.499
<i>When I was younger yesterday</i>

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:14.248
<i>- Out of my shell, just like a pearl
- Out of my shell, just like a pearl</i>

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:16.423
<i>Luminous, rare
Luminous, rare</i>

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:19.002
<i>Light up the world
Light up the world</i>

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:21.133
<i>Riding the swell
Riding the swell</i>

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.965
<i>Still the same girl
Still the same girl</i>

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:28.519
<i>Making things better,
better, better</i>

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:31.222
<i>Light up the world</i>

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:36.607
<i>Inside your heart</i>

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:40.649
<i>Make this world your home</i>

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:44.828
<i>Inside your heart</i>

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:46.700
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:50.329
<i>- Make this world your home
- Out of my shell</i>

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:52.752
<i>Just like a pearl</i>

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:57.924
<i>Luminous, rare
Light up the world</i>

01:12:58.124 --> 01:12:59.842
<i>Riding the swell</i>

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.465
<i>Still the same girl</i>

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:07.346
<i>Making things better,
better, better</i>

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:11.054
<i>Light up the world</i>

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:15.437
<i>Light up the world</i>

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:20.321
<i>Light up the world</i>

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.032
<i>Light up the world</i>

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:30.456
<i>Light up the world</i>
