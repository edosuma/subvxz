Isabelle.

01:26.987 --> 01:29.254
Please.

01:29.936 --> 01:32.691
Please, not today, Sebastian.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.195
Please.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.944
No! No!

01:58.185 --> 02:00.154
No! No!

02:00.254 --> 02:03.190
No! No! No, Sebastian!

02:03.290 --> 02:05.122
No!

02:05.893 --> 02:07.394
No, please.

02:07.494 --> 02:10.898
No! No! No!

02:10.997 --> 02:12.531
Please, Sebastian, no.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.098
Where are you?

03:18.498 --> 03:20.799
Where are you? Where are you?

03:35.849 --> 03:38.852
What did you say? You said yes, right?

03:38.952 --> 03:41.922
I don't know, it was late,
there were drinks.

03:42.022 --> 03:46.157
Hannah, come on.
Best friends get to hear first.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.681
Okay, if you must know...

03:50.264 --> 03:52.619
I've been tamed.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.337
Congratulations.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.340
- Thank you.
- I'm so happy for you.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.343
Who starts an engagement story
and then runs off laughing?

04:02.443 --> 04:04.828
She said yes.

04:05.112 --> 04:08.951
- I think more drinks are in order.
- Drinks!

04:09.451 --> 04:12.183
Hannah's getting hitched!

04:15.689 --> 04:19.958
- Hannah, where are we going?
- Just come on.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.998
Well, this is romantic.

04:33.374 --> 04:38.011
I don't know if you've heard,
but I'm getting married.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.315
Yeah, that's the word on the street.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.617
And I have a couple
of positions to fill.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.454
Like what?

04:46.554 --> 04:51.155
Like bartender, DJ...

04:51.692 --> 04:54.331
maid of honor?

04:58.465 --> 04:59.931
You want the gig?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.503
But...

05:02.603 --> 05:06.271
No buts. Just yes.

05:08.375 --> 05:12.210
- Yeah, I'm in.
- Good.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.568
I gotta pee.

05:15.668 --> 05:19.786
Always classy. You know you can't
do that in a wedding dress, right?

05:19.886 --> 05:22.766
I'll have to prove you wrong.

06:21.648 --> 06:26.417
Madison.

06:30.189 --> 06:31.024
Oh, God.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.493
That's it, you're all right.
You're all right. You're okay.

06:33.732 --> 06:35.629
Hey. You're okay. You're okay.
You're all right. You're all right.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.397
What happened? What happened?

06:37.497 --> 06:40.433
- You fell into the lake.
- You hit your head. Let me see.

06:40.533 --> 06:44.237
- No, no, no. There was something...
- No, no, no, you're okay.

06:44.706 --> 06:46.907
That's it. That's it.
I think you've had enough for tonight.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.509
- It's okay.
- We should go to the hospital.

06:48.609 --> 06:52.312
- Hey, look at me. You're okay.
- Okay, she's fine. Show's over, people.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.248
Maddie, you're okay. It's okay.

06:54.348 --> 06:56.350
We should get her warm.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.083
That's it. You're okay.

07:32.152 --> 07:35.088
Are you fucking serious?

07:35.188 --> 07:36.924
For one night,

07:37.024 --> 07:40.060
for one very important night,

07:40.160 --> 07:44.362
you couldn't just suck it up
and act like a normal human being?

07:44.865 --> 07:49.299
I have entertained these issues
for the past year.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.303
Your ups and downs.

07:56.576 --> 07:59.746
It's not going to kill you, okay?

07:59.846 --> 08:02.813
You're not gonna drown from it.

08:05.886 --> 08:11.294
I understand what you went through,
Maddie. I was there, but...

08:11.494 --> 08:12.557
fuck.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.461
- Hannah...
- I don't want to hear it.

08:18.365 --> 08:21.239
You need to deal with this.

08:21.401 --> 08:24.435
I talked to the other girls.

08:26.373 --> 08:29.541
And this was supposed to be my night.

08:32.879 --> 08:36.850
Tomorrow... tomorrow,
we're gonna deal with this.

08:37.782 --> 08:40.287
I tried, okay? I just...

08:40.386 --> 08:44.024
You just missed my wedding, Maddie.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.391
You're my maid of honor...

08:47.528 --> 08:50.263
and you just missed my wedding.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.333
What can I do to make it up to you?

08:53.999 --> 08:57.067
No! No!

09:01.708 --> 09:03.944
Be at my house tomorrow.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.405
8:00 PM.

09:58.665 --> 10:02.733
So I've never seen a bride
punch out a groomsman before.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.304
Yeah, that happened.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.075
Dabrowsky, during his speech.

10:12.446 --> 10:16.980
He called you the "afraid of honor."

10:18.485 --> 10:20.899
It sort of became
the running joke of the night.

10:20.999 --> 10:24.288
Hannah did not find it funny.

10:24.925 --> 10:28.984
I wanted to be there. I...

10:29.462 --> 10:34.231
I just felt like something bad
was gonna happen.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.568
Something bad did happen.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.672
You missed her wedding.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.774
Be there tonight.

10:51.185 --> 10:54.218
What's happening tonight?

11:01.461 --> 11:02.979
Hey, guys.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.414
Hey.

11:28.514 --> 11:30.957
This is Cathryn, Kobie's friend.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.994
She's gonna be helping us out tonight.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.864
I hope you don't mind, Maddie. Kobie's
been telling me what's been going on

11:37.964 --> 11:41.201
and I have a bit of experience
in the field.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.067
In what field?

11:44.871 --> 11:47.720
Contacting the other side.

11:50.176 --> 11:51.478
What?

11:52.582 --> 11:54.350
Don't worry, Maddie.

11:54.450 --> 11:58.219
Just take a seat
and we'll fill you in, okay?

12:09.562 --> 12:11.531
You guys, I...

12:11.631 --> 12:17.104
I wanted to say that I'm...
I'm so sorry about yesterday.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.439
Look, Maddie,
we appreciate your apology,

12:19.539 --> 12:23.276
but we've all heard it before
and nothing changes.

12:23.576 --> 12:28.224
We're all here because we love you.
Don't worry about me.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.918
This is an intervention, Maddie.

12:32.018 --> 12:36.022
You need to understand
that this is just a phobia.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.625
I know that it's a strong one.

12:38.725 --> 12:42.993
People overcome their fears
all the time.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.732
It's not just that.

12:45.832 --> 12:48.166
That's why I'm here, Maddie.

12:49.035 --> 12:52.038
You know, from what I've heard,
you might be experiencing hauntings.

12:52.138 --> 12:55.308
Let's not call them hauntings, okay?

12:55.408 --> 12:58.309
No, Hannah, these could be hauntings.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.950
I've been researching
various methods of cleansing.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.685
We're gonna try and make contact
with the entity you're seeing.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.991
Now, if it's an especially
evil entity, then we...

13:11.091 --> 13:15.192
I'm sure it's something
that can be easily helped.

13:18.431 --> 13:22.302
I've seen some malevolent spirits
in my line of work.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.938
Entities that can do anything
from blowing curtains

13:26.038 --> 13:28.274
to setting fires.

13:28.374 --> 13:32.813
There's a whole world beyond us
that most people don't believe in,

13:32.913 --> 13:36.683
a dangerous place
where tortured souls go to die

13:36.783 --> 13:39.419
- full of pain and...
- Cathryn?

13:39.519 --> 13:42.820
Can I speak to you
in the other room for a minute?

13:44.624 --> 13:48.059
- Well, we're about to get started here.
- It will only take a minute.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.132
Listen, take it easy
with the hauntings shit.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.268
Look, we want this to look real,
but don't go overboard.

13:55.368 --> 14:00.206
- Kobie said that you want to make contact.
- Yes, but this isn't an exorcism.

14:00.306 --> 14:04.444
Look, just wave some incense around
and tell her that whatever it is

14:04.544 --> 14:09.349
that's keeping her up at night is gone
so that she can move on with her life.

14:09.449 --> 14:14.387
Look, the last thing I need is you
putting more crazy ideas in her head.

14:14.487 --> 14:17.790
She has a mental illness.

14:19.926 --> 14:23.130
- What if she's...
- Listen, it's not real.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.666
Last time I'm gonna say it.

14:25.766 --> 14:30.768
Look, this was Kobie's idea and
I reluctantly agreed to go along with it.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.771
Don't make me regret my decision.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.642
The room's set up.

14:44.784 --> 14:48.553
Cathryn's done this before.
You don't need to worry.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.125
You guys, I'm... really not comfortable.

14:52.225 --> 14:58.031
Maddie, you are going, like,
full-blown crazy and it needs to stop.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.679
You're here to do this,
and nobody's going to leave this house

15:00.779 --> 15:02.732
until we give it a try.

15:02.832 --> 15:04.835
Try what?

15:07.974 --> 15:10.007
We'll show you.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.347
No, please, no, no.

15:13.447 --> 15:17.350
Don't worry. We would never make you do
anything you didn't want to.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.052
Okay? But tonight you can prove to us

15:19.152 --> 15:22.856
that you're at least
willing to try to get past this.

15:22.956 --> 15:26.359
Guys, please. I can't do this.

15:26.459 --> 15:31.030
Maddie, listen to me.
We're all here for you.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.800
But you have to confront this tonight

15:33.900 --> 15:37.170
so you can see that there's nothing
trying to hurt you.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.406
You'll be fine, I promise.

15:39.506 --> 15:42.142
This is how you make it up to her.

15:42.242 --> 15:47.013
You can either face it here with us
or let it ruin you alone.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.880
Because after tonight...

15:50.617 --> 15:53.198
we're not gonna be here.

16:06.366 --> 16:09.399
Come on. It's okay.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.536
Cathryn?

16:12.636 --> 16:15.742
We need a conduit
if you're going to make contact.

16:15.842 --> 16:18.545
The bathtub will act as a bridge
to the other side.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.812
It's okay. We're all here.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.598
Everyone, relax.
Take a few deep breaths.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.802
We want a comfortable environment
to welcome our guest.

16:45.305 --> 16:49.375
You guys, I can't stress how much
of a bad idea I think this is.

16:49.475 --> 16:53.977
Maddie, it's okay.
Cathryn's a professional.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.852
Okay, here we go.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.548
We open ourselves up
to communicate with whoever it is

17:05.647 --> 17:08.661
that wishes to speak to Madison.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.364
We welcome ourselves to this spirit.

17:11.464 --> 17:16.465
If you are here with us,
please show us a sign.

17:32.385 --> 17:36.420
That's good.
We have someone here with us.

17:37.957 --> 17:42.062
Whoever you are,
we are here to make peace.

17:42.162 --> 17:46.199
We are reassuring Madison
that you are not here to harm her,

17:46.299 --> 17:49.066
but just a lost soul.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.702
If you do wish Madison any harm...

17:53.506 --> 17:57.382
show us a sign now.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.252
Well, that's good news.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.993
No, no, no. Don't break the circle.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.429
- What the fuck, guys?
- That wasn't me.

18:16.729 --> 18:20.266
- This is done. Maddie, relax.
- What?

18:21.133 --> 18:23.069
- It was all a hoax.
- No, it's...

18:23.169 --> 18:24.737
No, it was a hoax.

18:24.837 --> 18:28.741
Sorry, we thought if we could
convince you that nothing was wrong...

18:28.841 --> 18:30.476
we just thought it would help.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.412
Thanks for taking this seriously,
you guys.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.914
Maddie, sorry.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.946
Look, we probably shouldn't have, but...

18:38.046 --> 18:40.720
we can't keep watching you
do this to yourself.

18:40.820 --> 18:45.591
I'm not trying to do this.
I don't know what to do.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.266
Nothing helps.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.621
Look, if you really
want to get better...

18:53.966 --> 18:56.800
we have to do something radical.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.320
Do you want to get better?

19:07.313 --> 19:09.382
You'll be safe.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.152
We're all here and we won't let
anything happen to you.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.606
I can feel him.

19:38.239 --> 19:39.412
He's here.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.910
No, he's not.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.485
He's not real.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.447
Just face it, Maddie.

19:53.326 --> 19:57.061
Just lean back into our arms
and you'll see once and for all.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.033
Don't let me go, okay?

21:12.905 --> 21:15.309
Pull her out! Pull her out!

21:16.409 --> 21:17.877
I can't!

21:17.977 --> 21:20.812
- She's gonna drown! Get her out!
- I can't!

21:23.382 --> 21:25.015
Get out of the way!

21:28.254 --> 21:30.257
Maddie!

21:30.957 --> 21:35.091
God, Maddie. Maddie? Maddie?

21:40.446 --> 21:42.499
Oh, shit.

21:42.735 --> 21:45.733
Maddie? Maddie?

21:46.806 --> 21:48.341
Maddie? Maddie?

21:48.441 --> 21:52.011
Maddie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Maddie?

21:57.283 --> 22:00.084
Maddie, what just happened?

22:02.054 --> 22:03.696
- Who is that?
- What?

22:03.796 --> 22:05.916
Oh, my God, someone's here.
I just saw him.

22:06.016 --> 22:09.362
- Enough!
- No, I swear, someone was right there!

22:09.462 --> 22:13.533
You think playing mind games with her
is okay? Were you holding her under?

22:13.633 --> 22:16.536
No, I didn't.
I swear someone was right there.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.071
No more fucking games. Get out now!

22:23.576 --> 22:28.048
Maddie, I'm so sorry.
That was supposed to help.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.981
Can I go home now?

22:37.590 --> 22:39.559
After a traumatic experience,

22:39.659 --> 22:43.229
the mind can have all sorts
of different reactions.

22:43.329 --> 22:48.000
The visions you're having,
you've created subconsciously.

22:48.100 --> 22:51.804
Like any phobia, it's the brain's
manifestations that do the most harm.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.140
This fear is the same.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.375
I get what you're saying.

22:56.475 --> 22:59.745
But this is different.
What I'm seeing, it's...

22:59.845 --> 23:02.434
It's in your head.

23:03.049 --> 23:06.132
I know you feel
what you're going through,

23:06.232 --> 23:08.158
it's different.

23:08.258 --> 23:11.025
But trust me, I've seen it before.

23:12.291 --> 23:15.320
You have episodes when you're close
to what you're afraid of.

23:15.420 --> 23:17.096
That's normal.

23:17.196 --> 23:20.281
It's your mind personifying your fear.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.866
Yeah.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.942
We can deal with this together,

23:30.042 --> 23:33.112
but I need you to embrace
what I'm telling you.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.848
The longer you tell yourself
these visions are real,

23:35.948 --> 23:38.481
the longer you're going to struggle.

23:39.251 --> 23:43.478
Do you really want to go through life
taking your liquids through a tube?

23:46.058 --> 23:48.806
I know you've had a hard time
growing up without a family, but...

23:48.906 --> 23:52.929
you have one now with your friends.

23:53.332 --> 23:56.502
Don't let these issues
ruin those relationships.

25:26.659 --> 25:27.960
Hello?

25:28.060 --> 25:32.462
Hi, I'm looking for Henley Jacobs.

26:00.593 --> 26:03.963
So probably gonna go... orange?

26:04.063 --> 26:06.596
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

26:08.267 --> 26:11.838
This is Butter. It's from London.
So that's probably gonna blend in well...

26:11.938 --> 26:14.307
Hi, you've reached Kobie.
I can't get to the phone right now,

26:14.407 --> 26:17.409
but just leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

26:17.509 --> 26:22.206
Hey, Kobie.
You haven't returned my calls.

26:23.683 --> 26:26.216
Please get back to me.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.052
It's important.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.501
Shit.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.835
Hello?

29:04.935 --> 29:07.010
Maddie?

29:09.181 --> 29:12.415
What, you're not answering
your phone now?

29:14.053 --> 29:15.721
Maddie?

29:15.821 --> 29:18.588
Hey, talk to me.

29:19.091 --> 29:23.696
I'm sorry about last night, okay?
I'm just trying to help you get past this.

29:23.796 --> 29:24.997
I'll get past this on my own.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.433
Maddie, please.
You're sick and you need help.

29:27.533 --> 29:30.169
Stop saying that, okay?

29:30.269 --> 29:34.173
Have you ever even asked yourself,
"Maybe she's not crazy"?

29:34.273 --> 29:35.925
I don't know,
maybe that's something a best friend

29:36.025 --> 29:39.211
should at least want to consider.
I was just leaving.

29:39.411 --> 29:43.212
Maddie, please. I'm sorry, okay?

29:44.183 --> 29:45.822
Where are you going?

29:45.922 --> 29:48.718
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

29:50.923 --> 29:53.012
I'll do it.

29:53.592 --> 29:56.125
Okay? I'll admit it.

29:57.196 --> 29:59.890
Last night freaked me out.

30:02.368 --> 30:07.436
I've been trying to
and I can't explain what happened.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.575
You got me, okay?

30:11.977 --> 30:14.514
What if you're telling the truth?

30:14.614 --> 30:17.910
- Let me by, please.
- Let me help.

30:19.618 --> 30:24.156
Look, whatever you wanna do,
wherever you want to go, no questions.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.374
I promise.

30:27.459 --> 30:32.629
Look, Maddie, I messed up, okay?
But just let me help.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.565
Please.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.201
Fine.

30:40.772 --> 30:43.292
Okay, I'll drive.

30:58.057 --> 31:01.090
Can you at least tell me
who we're meeting with?

31:01.560 --> 31:04.719
His name is Henley Jacobs and...

31:04.819 --> 31:08.364
he knows something
that might be able to help me.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.136
That's all you need to know.

31:11.236 --> 31:14.937
Okay, Hannah, please just
don't make this difficult.

31:17.309 --> 31:20.619
- So what does he know?
- Hannah, please.

31:20.719 --> 31:24.381
Sorry, I'm done. I'm done.
I'm a fly on the wall. Fly on the wall.

31:29.988 --> 31:31.323
Who is it?

31:31.423 --> 31:35.992
Hey, it's... it's Madison.
We spoke on the phone earlier.

31:37.296 --> 31:41.064
Come in and close the door.

31:43.736 --> 31:47.203
So what are you two young ladies
doing in my house today?

31:49.739 --> 31:53.058
I wanted to ask you about the Drownsman.

31:53.758 --> 31:55.178
Of course you do.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.981
What can you tell me about him?

31:59.685 --> 32:01.353
Nothing.

32:01.853 --> 32:06.155
I've wasted too many years
discussing that topic.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.226
Please, sir...

32:10.562 --> 32:12.223
I'm seeing this man.

32:21.090 --> 32:22.749
How are you seeing him?

32:26.211 --> 32:28.767
In visions.

32:31.950 --> 32:35.554
Okay, out. Get out. Time to go.

32:35.654 --> 32:39.925
Sir... sir, please. It's getting worse,
and I don't know how to stop it.

32:40.025 --> 32:44.527
Forget about it. Don't let it
do to you what it did to me.

32:45.497 --> 32:48.898
- Come on, Maddie, let's go.
- No.

32:49.835 --> 32:51.901
Please.

32:52.438 --> 32:55.471
I'm sorry for what happened.

32:57.676 --> 33:00.192
He killed your daughter.

33:00.746 --> 33:03.880
He killed other girls, too.

33:04.783 --> 33:07.218
What stopped him?

33:09.621 --> 33:10.888
Isabelle.

33:12.191 --> 33:16.093
She was to be one of his victims.

33:17.563 --> 33:20.296
But she drowned him.

33:20.900 --> 33:26.004
Drowned him in the same place
that he drowned the other women.

33:26.104 --> 33:27.771
Where is she now?

33:29.241 --> 33:31.543
You don't want to speak to her.

33:31.643 --> 33:34.086
Please, sir, I think we would.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.886
Soon after she killed him,

33:40.986 --> 33:44.121
she said she also had visions.

33:44.857 --> 33:48.727
- How did she stop them?
- She didn't stop them.

33:48.827 --> 33:53.362
She burned down her house,
she burned the neighbor's house down.

33:54.633 --> 33:59.435
She killed the man
who killed my daughter.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.583
Sir?

34:18.056 --> 34:22.594
Three, four times a day
he would take me to the basin.

34:22.694 --> 34:27.666
I struggled until I realized
he wasn't trying to drown me.

34:27.766 --> 34:31.103
It's not until your last breath is taken

34:31.839 --> 34:34.179
can you cross over.

34:40.946 --> 34:43.282
These are all the answers I could find.

34:44.532 --> 34:47.384
Did the police ever find his body?

34:49.521 --> 34:53.389
Just bones. All female.

35:02.801 --> 35:05.802
Take these memories.
I don't need 'em anymore.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.654
Hey, how's our crazy little friend?

35:23.754 --> 35:24.990
Yeah, she's okay.

35:25.090 --> 35:27.593
When I got up this morning,
I went downstairs

35:27.693 --> 35:31.063
and I poked my head into her room.
She looks like she's losing her mind.

35:31.163 --> 35:33.365
Look, when are you coming home?

35:34.154 --> 35:38.103
- I'm just finishing up here, why?
- Just get home, okay? We need to talk.

35:38.203 --> 35:40.804
Yeah, okay, sure.

37:48.194 --> 37:50.667
Oh, Jesus.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.406
You okay?

38:07.219 --> 38:10.286
So they're ramblings of a madman.

38:11.323 --> 38:14.426
Okay, like, "Last night,
I spent the evening

38:14.526 --> 38:19.428
trying to drown myself in the bathtub
in hopes he would take me."

38:19.528 --> 38:20.764
This guy's a nut.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.692
Okay, sorry.

38:25.792 --> 38:27.603
Got it.

38:28.206 --> 38:32.685
- It's just, why would...
- Just please keep looking.

38:32.785 --> 38:34.605
Okay.

38:42.854 --> 38:46.958
Okay, so a number of women
go missing over the years

38:47.258 --> 38:49.294
and then all of a sudden,
one of them shows up...

38:49.694 --> 38:52.864
Saying that she's killed him, escaped,

38:52.964 --> 38:54.931
but the police can't find a body.

38:56.868 --> 39:00.636
Well, the woman sounds crazy.
Why would they believe her?

39:03.671 --> 39:05.608
They didn't.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.335
Oh, shit.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.470
What?

41:18.777 --> 41:20.874
Shit!

41:34.159 --> 41:35.694
Hello?

42:45.229 --> 42:47.326
What's that?

42:49.934 --> 42:54.539
"The only records I've been able to find
on Sebastian Donner are about his birth.

42:54.639 --> 42:57.294
On July 30th, 1954,

42:57.494 --> 43:01.646
Louise Donner passed away
giving birth to an 18-pound baby.

43:01.746 --> 43:05.514
She had been pregnant with him
for over 19 months.

43:06.351 --> 43:09.421
As a boy, Sebastian claimed
he could vividly remember

43:09.521 --> 43:12.254
the sound of his mother's heartbeat...

43:12.657 --> 43:15.191
while in the womb."

43:23.702 --> 43:25.934
- You good to close up still, Kobie?
- Yeah, of course.

43:26.034 --> 43:28.608
- See ya.
- Bye.

43:41.319 --> 43:43.455
Kobie, please,
you need to get out of here.

43:43.555 --> 43:45.256
What are you doing here?

43:45.356 --> 43:46.891
I seriously don't
want to see you right now.

43:46.991 --> 43:50.793
Something's after us. All of us.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.199
I saw him.

43:54.299 --> 43:57.101
Oh, my God, Cathryn.

43:57.201 --> 43:59.821
I vouched for you last night.

44:00.105 --> 44:03.278
I told them
that you could sell it, but...

44:03.378 --> 44:06.107
instead you made it so much worse.

44:06.207 --> 44:08.646
Yes, I made it worse.

44:08.746 --> 44:13.518
We opened something,
a gateway to something evil.

44:13.618 --> 44:16.955
I don't know what to do.
I don't know how to stop it.

44:17.255 --> 44:22.294
Madison isn't making this up. We need
to tell her. I'm here to warn you.

44:22.394 --> 44:27.198
Jesus, just leave me
and my friends alone.

44:27.298 --> 44:30.575
I wouldn't be surprised
if your friends are already dead.

44:37.776 --> 44:40.428
I wish I was lying.

44:40.528 --> 44:42.445
Get out.

44:47.719 --> 44:51.900
I wasn't holding her under.
I wasn't even near the tub.

44:52.003 --> 44:56.094
Kobie, I wasn't holding her under.
You know I wouldn't do that.

44:58.229 --> 45:00.598
Help me! Help me!

45:01.298 --> 45:03.635
Help me! Help! Help!

45:03.735 --> 45:06.894
Help! Help me!

45:06.994 --> 45:08.239
Help me!

46:05.730 --> 46:08.284
Where are you?

46:18.743 --> 46:21.142
Show yourself.

46:27.986 --> 46:32.190
Terra ignus aqua. All three.

46:32.290 --> 46:34.855
Keep thy enemy away from me.

46:35.755 --> 46:38.964
Earth by divinity, divinity by earth.

46:39.064 --> 46:41.130
Keep thy enemy away from me.

46:49.673 --> 46:51.509
Please, no.

46:51.609 --> 46:53.437
Please.

47:56.507 --> 47:59.878
Okay, Isabelle.
Let's start with his basement.

47:59.978 --> 48:02.180
Tell me about it.

48:02.280 --> 48:07.149
I remember the smell. It was horrible.

48:07.919 --> 48:11.020
Under the baseboards,
he would keep the dead girls.

48:13.091 --> 48:16.524
I pretended I wanted to be with him.

48:17.161 --> 48:22.733
As I held him under, I swear
I could feel his heart break.

48:22.833 --> 48:24.769
Then he was gone.

48:25.385 --> 48:28.436
But his soul would live on...

48:28.806 --> 48:31.009
in my womb.

48:32.843 --> 48:34.679
He raped her.

48:34.779 --> 48:38.447
He raped Isabelle, left her with a baby.

49:36.174 --> 49:38.351
Hannah, don't. Don't.

49:38.451 --> 49:40.912
Hannah, please.

49:41.012 --> 49:43.714
Hey, it's Lauren.
Leave a message after the beep.

49:46.751 --> 49:50.041
Hey, this is Lauren's ph...

49:58.963 --> 50:02.398
That bastard.
I felt bad for him some days.

50:05.970 --> 50:10.741
...even through all his evil...
his pain could be seen.

50:10.841 --> 50:14.394
His suffering. I'd see it for moments.

50:15.446 --> 50:19.115
Then it's back to the terrible,
sick monster that he was.

50:22.250 --> 50:25.223
Maddie, I saw him!

50:35.766 --> 50:39.446
Who is that?
Cathryn said to stay away from water.

50:39.546 --> 50:41.503
Where is she now?

50:43.207 --> 50:45.810
- No.
- How?

50:45.910 --> 50:49.147
No, no. This isn't happening.
There's got to be an explanation for this.

50:49.347 --> 50:51.582
She was trying to warn us.

50:51.682 --> 50:54.037
We have to get out of here.

50:54.137 --> 50:56.690
Where are we going?

51:05.330 --> 51:09.258
I know what you guys are gonna say...
but shouldn't we call the police?

51:10.685 --> 51:12.971
Kobie, my best friends
wouldn't even believe this is real.

51:13.071 --> 51:16.007
- You think the police are going to?
- Maybe they've heard of something like this.

51:16.107 --> 51:20.475
Maybe they haven't, okay?
And then who are they gonna blame?

51:39.030 --> 51:41.263
What are these?

51:59.718 --> 52:02.153
That night at the lake...

52:02.253 --> 52:04.487
my accident, this is what I saw.

52:10.928 --> 52:12.895
Look.

52:18.002 --> 52:22.837
Dr. Malcolm to ward three.
Dr. Malcolm to ward three.

53:06.617 --> 53:08.152
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

53:08.252 --> 53:10.987
I'm looking for the whereabouts
of a former patient of yours.

53:11.087 --> 53:13.100
- Her name is Isabelle Heller.
- Isabelle?

53:13.200 --> 53:15.685
- Yes, do you know her?
- Yes, she's still here.

53:15.785 --> 53:17.695
Could we see her?

53:17.795 --> 53:22.600
She hasn't had a visitor in a long time.
It might be good for her.

53:22.700 --> 53:26.937
Oh, I have to ask you... do you have
any matches, lighters, anything flammable?

53:27.037 --> 53:28.306
- No.
- No.

53:28.406 --> 53:30.272
Good, Carter.

53:32.610 --> 53:35.079
Isabelle Heller has some guests.

53:35.179 --> 53:37.515
- You're here to see Isabelle?
- Yes.

53:37.715 --> 53:41.132
- Do you have anything flammable on you?
- I already asked.

53:41.232 --> 53:43.267
Okay.

53:43.367 --> 53:45.721
- Well, then, follow me.
- Okay, thank you.

53:49.960 --> 53:52.963
We've had to be pretty careful
after her incident.

53:53.063 --> 53:54.198
What happened?

53:54.298 --> 53:59.103
A few years back,
Isabelle stole a lighter from a nurse.

53:59.203 --> 54:02.907
She lit the whole east wing on fire.

54:03.007 --> 54:05.240
We almost lost her.

54:18.889 --> 54:20.765
Isabelle Heller?

54:24.895 --> 54:27.665
We were wondering if we
could ask you some questions.

54:27.865 --> 54:32.066
Please, it's an emergency.

54:35.039 --> 54:38.091
We want to know about Sebastian Donner.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.945
Sebastian.

54:45.149 --> 54:48.886
They said he spent too long in the womb,

54:48.986 --> 54:52.284
and when he held me under,

54:52.384 --> 54:54.659
he could feel my heartbeat...

54:54.759 --> 54:58.389
echo through the water...

55:00.164 --> 55:02.927
like a baby child

55:03.027 --> 55:05.569
in its mother's belly.

55:05.669 --> 55:08.072
We've seen this man.

55:08.172 --> 55:12.307
First just me,
but now he's after my friends.

55:12.476 --> 55:14.379
He took them.

55:14.479 --> 55:17.547
He first came to me in visions.

55:18.283 --> 55:21.285
He would come for you.

55:21.385 --> 55:23.888
I'm surprised you lasted this long.

55:24.479 --> 55:28.023
- Wait, what do you mean "lasted this long"?
- Madison, come over here.

55:30.661 --> 55:33.130
How do you know my name?

55:33.230 --> 55:35.900
It means...

55:36.000 --> 55:38.657
gift from God.

55:40.638 --> 55:43.371
I gave it to you.

55:45.943 --> 55:48.972
There were too many fires.

55:49.680 --> 55:52.981
Mostly while you were still in my belly.

55:54.218 --> 55:59.620
But I just wanted to keep him
away from you.

55:59.890 --> 56:02.440
My baby girl.

56:04.028 --> 56:06.361
You're my mother?

56:12.269 --> 56:15.134
So beautiful.

56:17.374 --> 56:18.666
Soft...

56:20.344 --> 56:23.378
and untouched.

56:25.683 --> 56:28.734
Even from his seed.

56:30.154 --> 56:32.590
He... he's m...

56:32.690 --> 56:35.291
He wants his daughter.

56:36.994 --> 56:39.763
You do not let him get her!

56:39.863 --> 56:41.999
No!

56:42.099 --> 56:44.335
Isabelle, please.

56:44.435 --> 56:48.038
- Please, we need to know how to stop him.
- He's always waiting.

56:48.138 --> 56:53.275
He's always waiting
to reach out for you! For me!

56:54.011 --> 56:57.980
A broken heart! He's so angry!

56:59.483 --> 57:03.316
- He will take you there, all of you!
- Calm down.

57:03.516 --> 57:05.790
He wants his baby!

57:05.990 --> 57:07.158
- Time to rest.
- No!

57:07.258 --> 57:09.860
- Time to rest, Isabelle.
- No, he will get you!

57:09.960 --> 57:12.563
- Time to leave, girls. Go, now!
- No, don't let him get her!

57:12.663 --> 57:16.067
- Isabelle, it's okay! Relax.
- Code white!

57:16.167 --> 57:21.012
...'cause he will get you!
He will get all of...!

57:51.601 --> 57:55.419
It's gonna be okay, Maddie.
We'll get through this.

57:59.777 --> 58:02.321
Get up on the railings now!

58:13.025 --> 58:16.091
- Hannah!
- What do we do?

58:34.645 --> 58:36.103
Kobie!

58:37.615 --> 58:38.756
Hold on!

58:42.486 --> 58:46.221
- I can't hold on!
- Please, don't let me go!

58:51.696 --> 58:53.332
I can't hold on!

58:55.332 --> 58:57.267
Please! Please don't let me go!

58:57.367 --> 59:00.270
- Kobie!
- No, Kobie!

59:25.763 --> 59:28.727
Oh, my God, Kobie.

59:33.571 --> 59:35.716
No, Kobie.

59:38.542 --> 59:42.277
This is where he takes them.
She'll be there.

59:46.283 --> 59:50.199
Sebastian Donner's house.
This is where we go.

59:52.055 --> 59:55.123
Hey, hey.

59:57.161 --> 59:59.130
Let's go find her, okay?

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.266
Okay. Okay.

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:20.254
Maddie?

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:32.591
No.

01:00:49.046 --> 01:00:50.848
No.

01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:53.183
No.

01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:07.331
No!

01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:09.597
No!

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:27.785
Die.

01:02:06.038 --> 01:02:08.059
It's close.

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:11.093
All those fires that she started.

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:15.463
- She did it to keep him away.
- What?

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:20.802
What are you looking for?

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.287
Fire.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:42.399
Okay, Maddie,
I want you to stay calm, okay?

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:47.431
No, no.

01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:50.663
Maddie, stay calm. We're almost there.

01:02:54.338 --> 01:02:57.441
I know I haven't said it before, but...

01:02:57.841 --> 01:03:00.635
I am so, so sorry.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:06.947
I should have at least considered
the possibility that it was real...

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:10.050
what you were seeing.

01:03:10.587 --> 01:03:16.123
To be honest, I didn't really
believe it myself until tonight.

01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:20.528
Look, we watch each other's backs
in there, okay?

01:03:27.605 --> 01:03:29.604
We're here.

01:04:02.973 --> 01:04:04.872
To keep him away.

01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:11.344
You gonna be okay in there?

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:16.119
Hey, we'll be strong
if we stick together.

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:17.967
Yeah.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.781
Let's come back, okay?

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:34.802
We have to go now.

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:40.277
Ready?

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.758
Not even close.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:21.018
He brings them to the basement.
We need to find it.

01:05:21.118 --> 01:05:24.351
Hey, just stay close, okay?

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:58.253
Hannah?

01:07:29.846 --> 01:07:32.136
Are you okay?

01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:35.782
Okay, I'm coming down.

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:38.622
- Help, Maddie!
- Hannah?

01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:41.024
- Maddie, help!
- Hannah?

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.182
Hannah?

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:51.632
Hannah?

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:55.070
Where are you?

01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:03.346
Hannah?

01:08:06.483 --> 01:08:09.016
Just take me.

01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:15.879
- Hannah! Hannah!
- You gotta get me out!

01:10:28.758 --> 01:10:31.261
Please. Hannah, please.

01:10:34.096 --> 01:10:35.330
Hannah, come on.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.768
Madison, help me! Help me!

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:48.004
Hannah?

01:11:48.204 --> 01:11:51.408
Hannah, please. Please, Hannah, please.

01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:54.433
Please, Hannah. Hannah.

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:01.551
Come on. Hannah, please wake up.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:04.552
Please. Go again. Okay, okay.

01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:26.910
God.

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:44.421
No.

01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:46.456
Please.

01:13:46.556 --> 01:13:48.055
Let me say good-bye.

01:13:50.493 --> 01:13:53.260
No. Father!

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:09.544
I'm sorry.

01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:15.549
You've been like a sister to me.

01:14:29.365 --> 01:14:31.366
I love you.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:30.854
It's not until your last breath is taken

01:16:30.954 --> 01:16:33.520
can you cross over.

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:46.013
Okay.

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:42.872
The police were here.

01:20:43.472 --> 01:20:47.040
And they questioned me
about the girls you were with.

01:20:49.745 --> 01:20:50.909
They're dead.

01:20:52.815 --> 01:20:54.882
Yes.

01:21:06.162 --> 01:21:07.363
It's okay.

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:12.101
- No. No, no.
- He's gone.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:13.681
I killed him.

01:21:15.938 --> 01:21:18.402
No.

01:21:18.502 --> 01:21:21.541
He hasn't been killed.

01:21:22.679 --> 01:21:25.178
He's been waiting.

01:21:32.288 --> 01:21:36.692
Isabelle.
