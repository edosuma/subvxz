01:43.038 --> 01:45.206
You have one new message.

01:45.971 --> 01:47.572
Hello, Mary, this is Harris

01:48.338 --> 01:49.939
l'm just reminding you
l have a class tonight.

01:50.004 --> 01:52.539
l'll be out at eight.
l'll call you then.

02:02.270 --> 02:03.738
What time is your class?

02:04.670 --> 02:05.270
Seven.

02:06.770 --> 02:08.204
You come home aftewards?

02:08.436 --> 02:10.172
l don't know. l may be seeing Mary.

02:11.370 --> 02:12.938
You haven't seen her this week.

02:14.203 --> 02:14.870
No.

02:16.402 --> 02:21.874
No. She's been busy. l've been busy.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.805
Her mama says she's seeing someone else.

02:28.435 --> 02:29.770
He lives in Raleigh.

02:30.202 --> 02:31.503
They don't like him.

02:32.869 --> 02:34.937
-Do they know him?
-No.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.735
Well how do they know
they don't like him?

02:40.101 --> 02:41.302
They like you.

02:42.268 --> 02:44.269
They like her to go steady with you.

02:46.735 --> 02:50.171
You used to go steady. In high school.

02:52.201 --> 02:54.002
Well, we're not in high school now.

02:57.801 --> 03:00.802
You don't think going to law
school at night is too much for you?

03:01.267 --> 03:02.468
l don't think so, Mama.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.669
l don't want to be a cop
for the rest of my life.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.936
A law degree will do you no
good if your health is ruined.

03:09.800 --> 03:10.934
l've got to go, Mama.

03:24.432 --> 03:29.337
This house was built
in 1923 by my father.

03:29.499 --> 03:33.970
He had built the first of his
tobacco warehouses by that time.. .

03:35.032 --> 03:37.001
buying and selling tobacco.

03:37.966 --> 03:41.402
And early on, he became rich doing it.

03:42.733 --> 03:45.167
My father was his own auctioneer.

03:45.598 --> 03:47.833
And he was known as a superb one.

03:48.865 --> 03:52.268
His idol was James Buchanan Duke.

03:52.965 --> 03:57.736
His ambition was to be
as rich as Mister Duke.

03:59.465 --> 04:05.770
When l was born, he wanted he named
after Mister Duke's daughter, Doris.. .

04:05.797 --> 04:07.465
but my mother said no.

04:09.697 --> 04:17.071
Here's a picture of Mister
Duke and his daughter, Doris.

04:17.564 --> 04:20.767
And over here is a
picture of me and my papa.

04:21.497 --> 04:26.134
-Did you ever meet the Dukes?
-No. My papa did, of course.

04:26.564 --> 04:29.465
And l never got tired
of hearing about them.

04:30.529 --> 04:31.998
Especially Doris.

04:32.796 --> 04:42.572
l used to collect every picture and
article about her l could find.. .

04:43.996 --> 04:44.730
Later,

04:45.029 --> 04:50.501
when growing and selling tobacco
got to be a losing proposition.. .

04:50.595 --> 04:54.298
everybody including
my papa was wiped out.

04:55.762 --> 04:56.996
Except the Dukes.

04:58.995 --> 05:00.730
l asked my papa about that one time and

05:00.762 --> 05:03.231
he said, well that's
because they're Dukes.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.063
What did he mean by that?

05:05.129 --> 05:08.098
He meant, l suppose that
they were invincible.

05:08.562 --> 05:12.464
Of course they weren't. Is anybody?

05:15.694 --> 05:20.365
They told me at the office that you
were thinking about selling the house.

05:20.394 --> 05:24.531
Well, that's the right idea,
but l go back and forth about it.

05:24.694 --> 05:29.065
lt is expensive to keep
up, the taxes are high,

05:29.094 --> 05:31.729
and it's much too large for one person.

05:33.393 --> 05:35.328
But l've lived here all my life.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.361
And when l think about leaving.. .

05:40.693 --> 05:41.927
l just can't.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.627
You have the warehouse, too.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.861
That's still in good
condition, l'm told.

05:48.293 --> 05:50.795
Yeah, that holds up pretty well.

05:51.760 --> 05:56.997
l've been renting it out, which doesn't
make me rich. But it does pay the taxes.

05:57.225 --> 06:00.128
lf you decide to sell your house
or warehouse, will you let me know?

06:00.192 --> 06:01.826
l will. l certainly will.

06:24.391 --> 06:26.526
-Councilman Early.
-Yes, Mister Mayor.

06:26.791 --> 06:29.660
Anything to report on
our downtown project?

06:35.925 --> 06:39.661
What about those men that bought all
those Liggett & Meyers warehouses?

06:39.723 --> 06:42.493
l'm always hearing about how someday
they're going to tear them down.. .

06:42.523 --> 06:46.728
or turn them into apartment houses or
something, and then another year goes by.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.991
We keep in touch with
them, but so far.. .

06:49.023 --> 06:53.128
l drop in on them from time to time
and ask if there's any progress.

06:53.723 --> 06:55.258
And what do they say?

06:55.424 --> 06:58.460
That you can't rush a
project as big as this.

06:58.523 --> 07:02.126
But ten years? It's almost
been ten years, hasn't it?

07:03.056 --> 07:05.691
More than that. And now this economy?

07:05.856 --> 07:08.992
How to get people to move back
into the city is the problem.

07:09.123 --> 07:10.591
There are no stores left

07:10.789 --> 07:13.525
so eveybody's moving
out to be near the malls.

07:13.589 --> 07:14.723
lt's a shame.

07:15.389 --> 07:18.525
What about the Thanksgiving
Day Parade for downtown?

07:18.656 --> 07:20.190
Are we going to repeat it this year?

07:20.989 --> 07:24.358
Or have a Christmas
parade in December instead.

07:25.021 --> 07:28.024
Time is getting short if we intend
to have a Thanksgiving parade.

07:31.021 --> 07:32.323
Well, to be brutally honest,

07:32.388 --> 07:35.424
l don't know if a parade of
any kind will get us anywhere.

07:35.488 --> 07:37.356
Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years.

07:38.122 --> 07:40.491
Last year, the attendance was pitiful.

07:40.622 --> 07:43.024
l couldn't even get my own kids to go.

07:43.987 --> 07:46.089
Do we have to make a decision tonight?

07:47.321 --> 07:49.623
Can't we postpone this
till our ne_ meeting?

07:50.954 --> 07:53.423
l personally would like a
little time to think it over.

07:54.154 --> 07:55.421
That's okay with me.

07:56.321 --> 08:00.558
Do l hear a motion that we postpone
any decision until ne_ week?

08:00.587 --> 08:01.888
l so move.

08:02.487 --> 08:04.956
-All in favor?
-&ye.

08:48.085 --> 08:49.718
-Hi, Harris.
-Mary.

08:49.784 --> 08:51.051
l was just about to call you.

08:51.117 --> 08:53.687
l made reservations for
tonight. You said you'd be free.

08:54.851 --> 08:57.420
l know. l'm sorry. l already
made a date for tonight.

08:58.084 --> 09:00.119
l'm sorry. A friend from work.

09:00.851 --> 09:02.118
l miss seeing you, Mary.

09:03.117 --> 09:05.420
-l miss seeing you, too.
-Have a good night.

09:18.116 --> 09:19.117
You look pretty.

09:21.783 --> 09:23.117
Doesn't she look pretty, Frank?

09:24.183 --> 09:25.284
She always does.

09:26.683 --> 09:27.617
Thank you.

09:28.883 --> 09:30.251
What time is he picking you up?

09:30.517 --> 09:33.285
His name's Howard, Frank.
He's not picking me up.

09:33.749 --> 09:34.783
l'm meeting him at a restaurant halfway

09:34.849 --> 09:36.450
between here and Raleigh.

09:43.215 --> 09:44.617
lt's driving me crazy.

09:48.516 --> 09:51.185
She lets him treat her any old way.

09:53.715 --> 09:55.316
l bet she ends up marrying him.

09:55.781 --> 09:56.882
Why do you say that?

09:59.148 --> 10:00.315
You don't know that.

10:01.248 --> 10:02.248
l do know that.

10:07.348 --> 10:10.017
Sometimes l think l lose
my mind from worrying.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.748
-Can l help you?
-Hi. Reservation for Howard Mercer.

10:39.446 --> 10:42.182
Oh, he's not arrived yet.
May l seat you at his table?

11:04.145 --> 11:06.280
Hi, this is Mary. Leave a message.

11:08.245 --> 11:11.014
Hello, Mary. This is Harris again.

11:12.211 --> 11:13.713
Are you free tomorrow night?

11:27.077 --> 11:29.279
Please forgive me for being late.

11:29.944 --> 11:32.513
Something came up at the last minute.

11:33.311 --> 11:34.311
Anything good?

11:35.877 --> 11:38.412
Looks like it. l'm just getting a salad.

11:39.011 --> 11:40.045
Do you want a drink?

11:41.911 --> 11:43.912
Oh. No, thanks. l had a Coke.

11:47.243 --> 11:49.511
Have you thought any more
about moving to Raleigh?

11:50.276 --> 11:51.443
Honestly, no.

11:51.910 --> 11:53.711
Will you promise me
you'll think about it?

11:56.743 --> 11:57.844
Yes, l will.

12:06.076 --> 12:08.777
l thought l heard you
come in. Did you call Mary?

12:09.775 --> 12:10.375
Yeah.

12:15.075 --> 12:16.910
How much longer are you
going to study, Harris?

12:16.942 --> 12:20.111
Not much longer, Mama.
You go on back to bed.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.879
Mrs. Taylor told me yesterday that
the law was very competitive.. .

12:25.942 --> 12:29.344
and that it was important to go to
certain schools to get your degree.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.175
l went to the only school
l could afford, Mama.

12:31.241 --> 12:33.710
She said lawyers here
are a dime a dozen.. .

12:34.441 --> 12:36.943
and are having a hard time
just like everybody else.

12:37.041 --> 12:40.310
Mama, go on to bed now. l
want to finish my studying.

12:41.374 --> 12:43.342
l worry so about you.

12:44.874 --> 12:47.610
l know you do. l wish you wouldn't.

12:48.207 --> 12:49.509
l'm gonna be all right.

12:51.473 --> 12:53.341
You're all l have, Harris.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.207
That's not so, Mama.

13:03.606 --> 13:04.641
You have Pete.

13:05.773 --> 13:07.007
But where is Pete?

13:08.673 --> 13:10.241
Wandering around the world?

13:12.639 --> 13:14.774
When was the last time l saw Pete?

13:19.239 --> 13:21.441
Please go to bed now, Harris. It's late.

13:22.605 --> 13:24.808
l worry about you staying up so late.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.807
Yes, Ma'am. l'm going
to bed in a little.

13:28.739 --> 13:29.673
Promise me.

13:30.839 --> 13:31.839
l promise.

14:18.536 --> 14:20.037
-Auntie?
-Willa?

14:22.003 --> 14:23.337
Were you in bed?

14:24.669 --> 14:25.903
Is something wrong?

14:26.036 --> 14:29.639
-No, no, l 'm all right.
-Oh, thank goodness.

14:29.936 --> 14:35.408
Well, to tell you the truth,
l feel a little uneasy.

14:35.469 --> 14:40.706
-Is there any reason?
-No, no apparent reason. l just.. .

14:41.235 --> 14:42.502
You want me to come over?

14:42.568 --> 14:44.503
Oh, l hate to ask you,

14:46.268 --> 14:47.969
but l would appreciate it.

14:48.002 --> 14:49.870
l'll come right away.

14:50.435 --> 14:51.769
Thank you, precious.

15:03.501 --> 15:05.569
You damn fool. Do you want
to burn this barn down?

15:06.034 --> 15:08.669
l told you it's in my contract there
is to be no smoking in this warehouse.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.135
lf you want to smoke, you go outside.

15:15.367 --> 15:17.702
Excuse me. l'm a little jumpy tonight.

15:22.801 --> 15:25.269
The Company would like to
establish themselves here.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.634
lf we help them to do that,

15:29.266 --> 15:31.201
they will look favorably on all of us.

15:32.033 --> 15:33.968
How did you find this warehouse?

15:34.333 --> 15:35.000
Luck.

15:37.766 --> 15:39.234
The Company sent me to look for towns

15:39.266 --> 15:42.369
or cities that might
benefit from our services

15:43.333 --> 15:44.900
Durham was on my list.

15:46.698 --> 15:49.902
And when l came here l found all
these empty tobacco warehouses.

15:51.399 --> 15:54.001
l took pictures of them, and l sent
the pictures back to the powers that be.

15:54.032 --> 15:57.301
And they got in touch with me and
told me to try to rent this warehouse.

15:57.899 --> 16:02.870
The owner was anxious to rent, as long as we
understood that no smoking was allowed here.

16:04.698 --> 16:08.334
She had seen a number of warehouses
set on fire by careless smokers.

16:10.531 --> 16:12.966
And l don't want the two of you speaking

16:13.031 --> 16:14.132
anything but Spanish
while we're in Durham

16:14.731 --> 16:16.732
Anybody ask you a question in English,

16:18.131 --> 16:19.565
pretend you don't understand.

16:21.097 --> 16:23.266
Yeah, what if they ask
those questions in Spanish?

16:24.664 --> 16:25.598
Come and get me.

16:27.064 --> 16:28.031
l'll answer.

16:29.997 --> 16:31.765
The Company wants me
to do all the talking.

16:51.462 --> 16:52.429
Where's Mama?

16:53.729 --> 16:56.598
She went to bed with a sick
headache worrying about you.

16:58.195 --> 17:01.098
She's afraid you'll be
swept off your feet like

17:01.129 --> 17:02.630
she was and marry the wrong person.

17:03.362 --> 17:05.097
Who said anything about getting married?

17:06.229 --> 17:08.130
Where did you meet
this... what's his name?

17:08.662 --> 17:10.430
-Howard.
-Where did you meet him?

17:11.829 --> 17:15.097
He's a lamer.. .at the firm.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.963
Why don't you bring him by the
house some time so we can meet him?

17:19.094 --> 17:21.196
Your mama thinks you're ashamed of us.

17:21.694 --> 17:23.096
l'm not ashamed of you.

17:23.127 --> 17:24.561
Well, your mama thinks so.

17:27.295 --> 17:28.329
Well, l'm not.

17:29.161 --> 17:30.629
Your mama likes Harris.

17:32.461 --> 17:33.528
l like Harris.

17:35.460 --> 17:38.429
His mama says he's going to
law school just to please you.

18:03.793 --> 18:04.627
Auntie?

18:11.993 --> 18:12.893
Auntie?

18:14.493 --> 18:17.796
Isn't this the craziest
you ever heard of?

18:18.325 --> 18:20.694
A woman as old as

18:21.192 --> 18:23.527
l am... here alone most of my life...

18:23.891 --> 18:25.660
is suddenly in a panic.

18:27.425 --> 18:29.460
l am so ashamed.

18:31.891 --> 18:33.760
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

18:34.958 --> 18:36.826
l'm here now and you're perfectly safe.

18:38.292 --> 18:39.426
Well, God bless ya.

18:51.191 --> 18:54.227
-Auntie?
-Yes, Ma'am.

18:56.124 --> 18:58.059
Who did you rent your warehouse to?

18:59.157 --> 19:02.659
l don't remember his
name. He seemed very nice.

19:02.690 --> 19:04.658
-Why?
-Was he a Mexican, Ma'am?

19:05.990 --> 19:07.858
l don't think so. Why?

19:08.889 --> 19:11.359
Because when l was passing
your warehouse just now.. .

19:11.990 --> 19:15.827
There were two Mexican men in front.. .

19:15.889 --> 19:17.691
sitting in chairs, smoking
cigarettes and drinking beer.

19:17.756 --> 19:21.659
Oh my heavens. l
particularly made a point

19:21.690 --> 19:26.193
in telling him smoking in or around
the warehouse was absolutely forbidden

19:27.789 --> 19:31.325
l think l'm going to call him right
now and makes sure he understands that.

19:31.388 --> 19:33.958
-lt's twelve o'clock, Auntie.
-Well l'll wake him up.

19:34.155 --> 19:36.323
l feel very strongly about this.

19:46.521 --> 19:47.755
Please leave a message.

19:48.454 --> 19:50.455
This is Georgiana Carr.

19:51.488 --> 19:55.959
Have Mr. Leroy.. .call me
immediately when he gets this message.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.389
it's about my warehouse.

20:00.721 --> 20:03.657
l got his answering service.

20:03.721 --> 20:07.523
His name is Leroy. l'll have
it out with him in the morning.

20:10.620 --> 20:12.088
Did he pay you by check?

20:13.653 --> 20:16.689
-Uh, no. Cash.
-Cash?

20:16.787 --> 20:19.222
Yes, that's the way he wanted it.

20:20.086 --> 20:23.590
Oh, l'm exhausted. Are you tired?

20:25.253 --> 20:26.387
Yes, Ma'am.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.853
You have one new message.

20:54.584 --> 20:57.454
Hello, Mary. This is Harris again.

20:58.751 --> 21:00.085
Are you free tomorrow night?

21:36.082 --> 21:38.118
Sit down. l have your
breakfast ready in a minute.

21:38.183 --> 21:39.450
l can't. l m late.

21:40.483 --> 21:41.517
l overslept.

22:06.248 --> 22:08.583
Good morning. Who's in charge here?

22:08.615 --> 22:09.482
No comprendo.

22:10.081 --> 22:13.218
Is Mr. Leroy in the warehouse?

22:32.147 --> 22:33.815
What is Mr. Leroy's first name?

22:33.847 --> 22:36.282
l don t know. He just
said, ''Leroy speaking''.

22:36.347 --> 22:38.415
He didn't say if it was first or last.

22:38.481 --> 22:40.882
-He didn't say if it was first or last.
-How do you know that?

22:40.946 --> 22:44.516
He told me. From near
Brownsville, l think he said.

22:44.546 --> 22:46.347
The town's called Vernon.

22:46.413 --> 22:48.882
Let's go into town and
bring the police out here.

22:54.913 --> 22:56.714
Gus Leroy. Thank you for seeing me.

22:58.746 --> 23:00.314
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

23:01.613 --> 23:03.747
l'm with the Environmental
Services Corporation.

23:03.812 --> 23:05.747
In Vernon, Texas, we have
a thriving business there.

23:05.779 --> 23:07.447
And in Gilyas, Louisiana.

23:07.945 --> 23:09.112
What is it you do?

23:09.279 --> 23:10.947
l'm in the business
of disposal of waste.

23:11.012 --> 23:11.746
We go around the county.. .

23:11.779 --> 23:13.347
looking for firms in
need of our service.

23:13.412 --> 23:14.913
-Do you know how many pounds...
-What do you want from me?

23:15.245 --> 23:18.314
l have very little authority
Actually, quite the opposite.

23:18.345 --> 23:21.981
l'm not asking you for anything.
Do you know Miss Georgiana Carr?

23:22.045 --> 23:23.446
-Yes.
-You know of her warehouse?

23:23.479 --> 23:25.913
-Yes.
-l just rented that for six months.

23:26.211 --> 23:27.312
Your company?

23:27.377 --> 23:29.246
Yes sir. l did. For my company.

23:30.744 --> 23:32.212
What do you intend to do with it?

23:32.278 --> 23:34.380
We just, last night,
placed fifty canisters...

23:34.411 --> 23:35.812
of hazardous waste there.

23:36.344 --> 23:39.714
Good god. Does Miss Georgiana know this?

23:39.744 --> 23:41.579
Well, we tried to tell her
when we leased the space.. .

23:41.611 --> 23:43.512
but she was never
interested or concerned ...

23:43.544 --> 23:45.379
with what the tenants put
in her warehouse, she said.

23:45.444 --> 23:48.479
-Is it legal what you're doing?
-Yes, sir. We checked very thoroughly.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.778
There are no environmental
laws in the City of Durham.. .

23:50.810 --> 23:53.045
or the State of North
Carolina that we are breaking.

23:53.177 --> 23:54.344
Please don't be alarmed.

23:54.610 --> 23:56.945
The waste is transported in
the kind of canisters approved

23:56.977 --> 23:58.611
by all Federal agencies.

23:59.110 --> 24:01.111
-When did you get in?
-Last night.

24:01.277 --> 24:03.812
l travel usually at night. Less traffic.

24:04.576 --> 24:06.912
Anyway, l won't take
up more of your time.

24:08.542 --> 24:11.211
One day, I'd like to discuss a plan.

24:11.242 --> 24:12.743
My company would like
you to think about.

24:13.409 --> 24:16.545
-Is this about hazardous waste?
-In a sense.

24:18.242 --> 24:19.476
Oh, l don't know, sir.

24:20.142 --> 24:21.776
We're very conservative here.

24:22.342 --> 24:24.577
l don’t think we're ready
for anything like that.

24:24.642 --> 24:27.544
l understand. But remember this.

24:27.809 --> 24:29.377
Someone has to address the problem

24:29.409 --> 24:31.576
if all categories of
waste continue to grow.

24:32.041 --> 24:35.477
Someone has to take responsibility
to find a solution to this problem.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.076
Our plant in Vernon,

24:37.108 --> 24:39.143
Texas, has rejuvenated a dying town

24:39.308 --> 24:40.676
And from all l've observed here,

24:40.708 --> 24:42.676
l'm confident it could
be the same for Durham.

24:42.941 --> 24:45.143
We have no unemployment
in Vernon now.. .

24:45.308 --> 24:47.643
And it's shrinking every day
in our... plant in Louisiana.

24:48.108 --> 24:49.909
-No unemployment?
-No.

24:52.207 --> 24:53.708
Mr. Mayor, l hate to interrupt you,

24:53.740 --> 24:55.741
-but your next appointment is here.
-Thank you.

24:56.840 --> 25:00.376
-We'll talk about this later, Mr....
-Gus. Gus Leroy.

25:01.573 --> 25:04.410
l think you should know
that Durham is one.. .

25:04.440 --> 25:06.909
of several cities in the South where my
company's considering opening a branch

25:07.607 --> 25:11.110
Thank you for telling me. l will
be in touch with you very soon.

25:25.539 --> 25:26.840
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

25:27.406 --> 25:29.808
-l want to file a complaint.
-Yes, Ma'am.

25:29.872 --> 25:32.575
My aunt here has a warehouse.. .

25:32.639 --> 25:34.207
near her property which
she rents out for storage.

25:34.239 --> 25:39.810
And she just recently rented it out to
a Mr. Leroy from Brownsville, Texas...

25:39.938 --> 25:42.740
at which time he gave her
cash payments for six months

25:42.938 --> 25:44.372
Excuse me, Willa.

25:44.638 --> 25:49.342
l don't believe Mr. Leroy
is from Brownsville, Texas.

25:49.405 --> 25:53.308
He's from Vernon, which
is near Brownsville.

25:54.805 --> 25:58.741
Well, wherever he's from, he gave
her cash payments for six months.

25:58.771 --> 26:01.707
He has two Mexican men
guarding the property.

26:01.937 --> 26:04.673
Who don't speak English,
or pretend they don't.

26:04.737 --> 26:06.371
And when we went over
there this morning.. .

26:06.437 --> 26:08.906
-What was his name?
-Whose?

26:08.971 --> 26:10.972
The man your aunt is
renting the property to.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.204
l told you. Leroy.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.239
Is that the first name or the last one?

26:16.537 --> 26:19.071
l don't know. And my
aunt doesn't either.

26:22.569 --> 26:24.004
Now, what would you like me to do?

26:24.703 --> 26:27.305
Have someone go over to the warehouse.

26:27.903 --> 26:30.505
And tell Mr. Leroy and his men...

26:31.036 --> 26:33.738
That Miss Carr has the right

26:34.569 --> 26:38.073
to inspect her warehouse
any time she wishes

26:38.270 --> 26:43.807
And there is to be no
smoking in the warehouse ever.

26:44.102 --> 26:46.103
l am very firm about that.

26:46.802 --> 26:47.602
All right.

26:50.202 --> 26:55.507
l'll go out to your warehouse just as soon as
l finish here, and l'll see what's going on.

27:01.002 --> 27:01.869
Thank you.

27:18.434 --> 27:23.205
-How's Durham?
-Oh, about the same.

27:28.933 --> 27:29.900
Be careful, honey.

27:31.967 --> 27:32.767
What do you mean?

27:33.967 --> 27:35.568
Just be careful is all. .

27:37.533 --> 27:38.667
What do you mean, be careful?

27:45.500 --> 27:48.735
How about dinner again tonight?
l promise not to be late.

27:50.299 --> 27:53.535
-l can't. l have an engagement.
-Break it.

27:53.932 --> 27:55.066
-l can't.

27:56.199 --> 27:58.301
Break it. For me.

28:00.966 --> 28:03.068
l'm sorry. l just can't.

28:15.398 --> 28:17.666
He's soon after every
new girl that works here.

28:18.965 --> 28:21.233
And when he's through
with them, they're fired.

28:24.531 --> 28:25.798
He has a wife and two children,

28:25.864 --> 28:28.834
but that's a well kept
secret around here.

28:46.063 --> 28:47.098
Are you married?

28:49.430 --> 28:50.164
Yes.

28:52.696 --> 28:54.464
l also have two children.

28:55.562 --> 28:58.432
And for the sake of the
children, we all live together.

28:58.496 --> 29:01.265
-Oh no.
-Neither of us are very happy.

29:02.996 --> 29:05.832
When the children are grown...
the marriage will be dissolved.

29:06.796 --> 29:08.097
Any other questions?

29:09.963 --> 29:10.530
No.

29:12.029 --> 29:13.764
Don't be too hard on me, Mary.

29:15.595 --> 29:18.431
l do the best l can in a
very difficult situation.

29:27.228 --> 29:29.830
-Oh, Mr. Leroy.
-Hello, Miss Georgiana Carr.

29:29.962 --> 29:32.764
l got your message. l
was about to call you.

29:32.861 --> 29:35.964
When l'm finished here this morning,
l'll be over to your house, if l may.. .

29:36.027 --> 29:37.762
to talk about extending our lease.

29:38.461 --> 29:39.695
You've been well, l hope.

29:40.127 --> 29:41.495
Yes, thank you.

29:41.694 --> 29:45.397
This is my niece, Willa Jenkins.

29:48.894 --> 29:49.694
How do you do?

29:50.494 --> 29:53.263
-Hello.
-And you've been well, l hope?

29:53.927 --> 29:56.396
Well enough, considering
the business l'm in.

29:56.894 --> 30:00.029
What business are you in, Mr. Leroy?

30:00.160 --> 30:02.128
Hazardous waste disposal.

30:02.293 --> 30:03.027
Spent half the night

30:03.093 --> 30:05.695
getting our canisters settled
in your beautiful warehouse.

30:05.760 --> 30:11.832
You mean to tell me you have hazardous
waste stored in my aunt's warehouse?

30:11.960 --> 30:14.062
Yes. But don't be concerned.

30:14.093 --> 30:15.761
They're stored in
canisters specially designed

30:15.793 --> 30:17.594
according to government regulations.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.126
Would you like to see them?

30:21.292 --> 30:22.893
Uh, no thank you

30:24.592 --> 30:25.426
Miss Willa?

30:26.358 --> 30:29.295
-Yes, l would.
-Come along.

30:39.759 --> 30:40.926
Here are the canisters,

30:40.959 --> 30:43.427
all properly labeled
listing the contents.

30:46.024 --> 30:48.426
-Where did these come from?
-Louisiana

30:49.291 --> 30:51.192
We're hoping in a week
we'll find room for these

30:51.224 --> 30:52.458
in our treatment plant in Texas.. .

30:52.491 --> 30:54.826
where they'll be made
safe for permanent storage.

30:54.924 --> 30:57.626
-Where will that be?
-Some place in Texas.

30:58.357 --> 31:01.394
Finding a final resting place
gets more difficult all the time.

31:14.657 --> 31:17.726
What do these things look like up close?

31:17.790 --> 31:19.491
Like nothing, really.

31:19.556 --> 31:22.026
l mean, you can't see inside
the canisters, of course.

31:22.090 --> 31:25.926
They have tags on them
saying ''hazardous waste''

31:25.956 --> 31:27.290
which gives me the creeps.

31:27.355 --> 31:30.992
Anyway, l'll feel better
when they're out and gone.. .

31:31.055 --> 31:32.757
and l hope you won't let him come back

31:32.789 --> 31:34.824
and store more of
them in your warehouse.

31:35.089 --> 31:37.825
What does it mean, hazardous waste?

31:37.855 --> 31:41.459
-What do you think it means?
-Dangerous.

31:41.522 --> 31:43.757
More than dangerous. More than.. .

31:46.055 --> 31:48.757
These two ladies are allowed to go in

31:48.821 --> 31:49.454
and out of the ware house at any time.

31:49.488 --> 31:52.057
And you may speak English to
them if they ask you a question.

31:52.155 --> 31:53.322
l'll see you ladies later.

31:56.288 --> 32:01.893
They brought them from Louisiana.
They're sending them to Texas in a week.

32:02.054 --> 32:08.795
Only to be buried, so they
say, if Texas will have them.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.722
What has the world come to?

32:20.353 --> 32:21.288
What's in there?

32:22.587 --> 32:23.354
Death.

32:25.887 --> 32:26.520
Ma'am?

32:27.154 --> 32:28.021
Death.

32:37.286 --> 32:38.687
What's in these canisters?

32:39.486 --> 32:40.753
They're all labeled.

32:44.052 --> 32:47.289
-Hazardous waste.
-lt's harmless in the canisters.

32:47.886 --> 32:50.255
The ladies that were just
here filed a complaint.. .

32:50.352 --> 32:52.954
that they were not allowed
earlier in her warehouse.

32:53.085 --> 32:57.289
And there has to be no smoking
around or in the warehouse.

32:58.985 --> 33:02.688
l understand, Officer.
It's all taken care of.

33:15.050 --> 33:16.552
What are you thinking about?

33:17.251 --> 33:19.086
Mr. Leroy and my ex-husband.

33:19.951 --> 33:23.421
-What, do you think they look alike?
-No, not at all.

33:24.284 --> 33:27.153
lt is the way he assumed
you'll be delighted

33:27.217 --> 33:30.286
by anything he chooses to
do no matter how outrageous.

33:35.550 --> 33:39.020
l certainly hope you have no
intention of extending his lease.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.218
-Well...
-l don't want to tell you what or

33:41.250 --> 33:45.220
But in my opinion... the sooner
you get him out of your warehouse

33:45.283 --> 33:46.817
Well, how can l do that?

33:47.049 --> 33:50.553
By saying he got the warehouse
under false pretenses.

33:50.616 --> 33:52.651
He didn't tell you what he
was going to store in there.

33:52.716 --> 33:56.553
Well he tried to tell me, but
l said l wasn't interested.

33:57.816 --> 34:02.586
Well, if you had known what you know
now would you have rented it to him?

34:02.649 --> 34:04.717
-Well, l suppose not.
-Well?

34:08.848 --> 34:10.617
Do you ever hear from your husband?

34:11.947 --> 34:14.251
Why on earth do you bring him up?

34:15.748 --> 34:19.585
Well, l didn't bring him up.
You mentioned him first, honey.

34:21.813 --> 34:22.581
No.

34:23.914 --> 34:26.716
l never hear from him,
and l hope l never do.

34:30.714 --> 34:32.081
So, if you agree with me,

34:32.148 --> 34:36.518
that it would be the better...
part of wisdom to break his lease,

34:36.714 --> 34:39.683
l think we should go to a lamer
and explain the circumstances.

34:39.748 --> 34:43.484
l'm sure he'll tell you you'll
have no trouble asking.. .

34:43.913 --> 34:46.382
him to leave as long as you
return the money he has paid you.

34:46.446 --> 34:47.815
All in cash, right?

34:50.612 --> 34:52.414
Yes, that' s right.

34:55.846 --> 34:58.082
So, why don’t' we go and
see a Iawyer right now?

35:01.013 --> 35:04.248
Would you mind if l
didn't go this afternoon?

35:04.279 --> 35:08.816
l'm tired and it's been quite
a strenuous morning for me.

35:09.246 --> 35:12.582
Sure. Do you mind my going?

35:15.012 --> 35:17.114
No. Certainly not.

35:47.910 --> 35:49.878
-Hey, Kate.
-What can l do for you?

35:50.677 --> 35:52.045
l need the use of a computer.

35:52.110 --> 35:53.911
l'm looking for something
on hazardous waste.

35:54.310 --> 35:56.278
Okay. take your pick.

35:57.210 --> 35:58.010
Thanks.

36:32.542 --> 36:35.711
-Is Mr. Leroy here?
-No, Ma'am.

36:36.508 --> 36:39.878
-Do you know when he'll be back?
-l don't know, Ma'am.

36:42.542 --> 36:45.311
-Do you know who l am?
-Yes, Ma'am.

36:46.875 --> 36:50.278
-Did you know l own the warehouse?
-Yes, Ma'am.

36:51.108 --> 36:54.076
-Do you know what they did here at one time?
-No, Ma'am.

36:56.207 --> 36:59.543
-They bought and sold tobacco.
-Yes, Ma'am.

37:01.207 --> 37:04.643
-You didn't know that, did you?
-No, Ma'am.

37:07.474 --> 37:10.243
There were several tobacco
companies here then.

37:11.541 --> 37:16.811
Every day taking tobacco leaves, grinding
them up and making them for cigarettes.

37:17.740 --> 37:24.613
By five o'clock the dust from the ground
up tobacco would just cover the town.

37:25.073 --> 37:26.541
lf you were out of doors,

37:27.073 --> 37:29.875
your face and hands would
be covered by the dust.. .

37:29.906 --> 37:31.774
till you turned a shade of brown.

37:37.072 --> 37:40.975
l want to go inside.
l want to see it again.

37:42.205 --> 37:43.005
Yes, Ma'am.

37:56.739 --> 37:59.474
The last time l was here
l was with my father.

38:02.471 --> 38:05.640
He hadn't been feeling well all winter.

38:06.038 --> 38:08.039
lt was our first spring day.

38:08.204 --> 38:09.972
A lovely spring day.

38:11.138 --> 38:16.443
He said to me, ''take a walk
with me over to the warehouse''.

38:17.371 --> 38:20.073
l want to see whether
or not l should sell it.

38:21.737 --> 38:24.473
lt would break my heart to sell it.

38:25.903 --> 38:29.373
But what good will it do me or you...

38:30.137 --> 38:32.973
now that tobacco no longer makes a dime.

38:33.670 --> 38:36.873
My father has this
warehouse built, you know.

38:38.037 --> 38:42.040
Eight years before l
was born. Or was it ten?

38:43.736 --> 38:45.204
Or was it seven?

38:48.102 --> 38:51.104
Anyway, it was a long time ago.

38:54.636 --> 39:00.475
l don't want them in the
warehouse. But l need money.

39:01.369 --> 39:03.504
l don't want them in any warehouse.

39:04.334 --> 39:06.136
Willa says they mean death.

39:09.535 --> 39:12.571
l certainly don't want
death anywhere near me.

39:18.068 --> 39:20.036
Certainly not in my warehouse.

39:22.101 --> 39:26.971
But how long can l
keep it? l don't know.

39:31.267 --> 39:32.301
l don't know.

39:41.867 --> 39:42.934
You're going to have to hustle.

39:43.134 --> 39:45.569
Vernon just called me. They have
an opening for our canisters.

39:45.734 --> 39:48.469
They want them there in two days. l'm
expecting another hundred tomorrow.

39:51.099 --> 39:53.768
-Yes?
-Gus Leroy? It's the Mayor speaking.

39:54.066 --> 39:58.470
l was wondering if l could call
a meeting with the council.. .

39:58.533 --> 40:00.434
and a few people
around the community.. .

40:00.499 --> 40:04.135
who have expressed interest in what
you can tell us about your Vernon plant.

40:04.199 --> 40:06.935
Yes, sir. How about tomorrow
night at seven o'clock?

40:07.199 --> 40:09.067
-Thank you.
-l'll be there.

40:21.331 --> 40:25.736
l had a nice talk with the
attorney, Bruce Jackson.

40:40.330 --> 40:41.999
Are you all right, Auntie?

40:44.297 --> 40:46.932
Are you worried about
your warehouse? Don't.

40:47.497 --> 40:50.399
We'll be free of Mr.
Leroy, l'm sure of that

40:51.097 --> 40:53.399
The lamer says you will have no trouble

40:53.531 --> 40:55.431
getting out of your deal with him.

40:55.463 --> 40:58.699
Just say that since you were not,
at the time of the contract.. .

40:58.763 --> 41:00.631
aware of how he was going
to use your warehouse.. .

41:00.663 --> 41:02.698
you would like to void the agreement.

41:03.396 --> 41:07.466
And you'll return the money he gave
you. That's good news, isn't it?

41:09.163 --> 41:11.498
-Willa.
-Yes, Ma'am.

41:14.429 --> 41:17.899
-You have to know something.
-What is it, Auntie?

41:18.229 --> 41:20.364
-l'm ashamed to tell you.
-Why?

41:21.362 --> 41:22.463
Because l am.

41:28.095 --> 41:30.197
l have very little money, Willa.

41:30.828 --> 41:33.932
l know that. l have little money too.

41:34.029 --> 41:35.964
But you have your trust fund.

41:36.029 --> 41:37.230
-l know it's modest, but surely

41:37.262 --> 41:39.563
-Willa.
-Yes.

41:42.028 --> 41:48.067
l was told last week. There
are no funds in my trust.

41:49.427 --> 41:50.796
When l heard that,

41:52.494 --> 41:56.631
l called Crosby Gaige
about selling the house.

41:57.361 --> 41:58.095
l don't know.

41:58.894 --> 42:03.664
But that morning, Mr. Leroy
came about renting the warehouse.

42:03.727 --> 42:07.497
And he gave me cash. So l
postponed selling the house

42:10.393 --> 42:13.262
So l postponed selling the house.

42:13.960 --> 42:17.763
l paid my bills and for
that dental work l had done.

42:18.393 --> 42:22.329
And l needed some.. .whatever.

42:25.925 --> 42:29.629
l have practically
nothing left to return.

42:34.692 --> 42:37.694
Oh, l should have sold
this house a long time ago.

42:40.492 --> 42:42.894
lt was pride that kept me from doing it.

42:44.958 --> 42:50.063
l couldn't bear to have my friends.. .

42:51.725 --> 42:54.994
know that l had to give up my home.

42:59.625 --> 43:03.962
Then last night, l though
what friends are left?

43:04.091 --> 43:05.724
They're mostly dead.

43:07.290 --> 43:08.290
Mostly.

43:13.323 --> 43:18.495
When our troubles first began,
and so much money was lost.

43:18.557 --> 43:23.795
And the tobacco empire was broken up
and there was bankruptcy everywhere.

43:25.024 --> 43:30.895
Papa used to say it was a
curse put upon us for our sins.

43:32.489 --> 43:37.493
What sins?' l asked him. The sin
of buying and selling tobacco?

43:39.389 --> 43:40.690
No, he said.

43:42.756 --> 43:44.390
For the sin of pride.

43:47.623 --> 43:50.658
The sin of thinking
we were invulnerable.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.857
That our good fortune
would last forever.

43:56.655 --> 44:01.326
Because we deserved our good
fortune. And it would never ever end.

44:02.855 --> 44:06.825
Well.. .it did end.

44:10.088 --> 44:16.126
And every night in the year Papa
died, l would hear him in his room.

44:18.287 --> 44:20.155
Asking God to...

44:21.687 --> 44:23.388
forgive him for his sin of pride.

44:33.486 --> 44:35.321
l'll sell my house now.. .

44:40.686 --> 44:42.154
and start over.

44:45.586 --> 44:48.322
l'll explain to Mr. Leroy what happened.

44:48.520 --> 44:51.623
But l'll give him his money
as soon as my house is sold.

44:55.585 --> 45:01.757
And then maybe l'll sell the warehouse.

45:05.818 --> 45:06.586
Maybe.

45:14.552 --> 45:15.419
Can l come in?

45:15.652 --> 45:17.586
In school l was taught when
you ask can' in a question.. .

45:17.618 --> 45:19.753
you're asking, am l able to come in.

45:19.784 --> 45:21.585
And may means, do l have permission.

45:21.651 --> 45:23.319
Didn't you learn that in school, Mother?

45:23.884 --> 45:29.055
No, l'm afraid l didn't, honey. l
barely went to the fifth grade, remember?

45:30.551 --> 45:33.220
l didn't learn much except
for what life has taught me.

45:33.817 --> 45:35.953
l was married to your
father when l was fifteen.

45:36.018 --> 45:38.285
Had you when l was
seventeen. Divorced...

45:38.316 --> 45:39.885
Oh, l was teasing. Forgive me.

45:40.750 --> 45:42.084
You are forgiven.

45:48.017 --> 45:50.819
-l've been fired, Mama.
-What?

45:51.416 --> 45:55.487
l've been given my notice
and two weeks severance pay.

45:56.450 --> 45:58.185
-Why?
-Why?

46:00.649 --> 46:02.183
l don't know why.. .

46:06.216 --> 46:07.550
except for Howard.

46:08.782 --> 46:11.050
He asked me if l would
go out with him again,

46:11.082 --> 46:12.616
and l refused, and he asked why.

46:12.682 --> 46:15.317
l said because I'd been
told he has a wife.. .

46:16.782 --> 46:20.485
and two children.

46:21.881 --> 46:22.881
Was he married?

46:24.215 --> 46:24.782
Yes.

46:26.181 --> 46:27.815
And were there children?

46:32.615 --> 46:33.349
Yes

46:35.448 --> 46:36.382
Mercy.

46:42.515 --> 46:43.215
Mama.

46:45.447 --> 46:46.347
Yes?

46:48.813 --> 46:50.882
l don't want to stay in Durham.

46:55.214 --> 46:56.515
l want to go away.

47:01.714 --> 47:04.917
l'm twenty four. l've never
been further than Raleigh.

47:07.079 --> 47:09.347
The Wiggins twins are in Atlanta.

47:09.412 --> 47:10.447
They say l can come stay with them until

47:10.479 --> 47:14.082
l find work and a place of my own.

47:18.113 --> 47:19.481
When do you want to leave?

47:20.613 --> 47:21.413
Tomorrow.

47:25.746 --> 47:26.780
Tomorrow?

47:34.378 --> 47:35.378
Yes, Ma'am.

47:52.810 --> 47:55.813
-Oh hello, Mr. Leroy. Please come in.
-Thank you.

47:59.577 --> 48:04.515
-Hello, Miss Georgiana.
-Hello, Mr. Leroy. Won't you sit down.

48:04.810 --> 48:05.545
Thank you.

48:18.309 --> 48:21.513
l won't be long. l've just
gotten word from Vernon.

48:21.543 --> 48:23.444
They would like the
canisters there in two days...

48:23.510 --> 48:25.411
and we're getting a new
batch here from Louisiana.

48:31.309 --> 48:34.378
-lt's been a beautiful day, hasn't it?
-Yes.

48:35.475 --> 48:38.211
Estaquio tells me you were
over looking at your warehouse.

48:39.875 --> 48:42.544
l don't know how long it's
been since l was inside.

48:42.575 --> 48:45.344
l am very satisfied with your
warehouse, Miss Georgiana.. .

48:45.408 --> 48:48.912
and I'd like to extend my
lease for another six months

48:49.808 --> 48:51.577
and for five years beyond that.

48:51.709 --> 48:53.110
l have authority from my company

48:53.142 --> 48:55.176
to redo the financial arrangement...

48:55.241 --> 48:58.243
and l think you'll find them much more
favorable to you than they are at the present.

48:58.307 --> 49:01.344
What are they paying you now,
like 500 dollars a month, yes?

49:01.708 --> 49:05.478
Well, l think you should get a lamer
to negotiate the five year contract

49:05.841 --> 49:09.511
Cause my company's going to need
to get a sense of the potential.. .

49:10.041 --> 49:12.977
to sense if the city will be
friendly to an operation like ours.

49:13.041 --> 49:15.276
-Mr. Leroy...
-All this takes time and money.

49:15.341 --> 49:18.276
But you will have a
friend in court in me.

49:20.273 --> 49:22.274
Because l think the
opportunities here are tremendous.

49:22.340 --> 49:24.542
They just need to have
the imagination to see it.

49:24.573 --> 49:26.074
l have a feeling they will.

49:28.306 --> 49:30.242
So to get down to
more practical matters.

49:32.673 --> 49:38.878
l would suggest that the ne_ six
months of the lease should start now.

49:40.805 --> 49:44.643
And instead of six hundred a
month... as l believe it calls for,

49:44.672 --> 49:46.040
let's raise it to a thousand.

49:47.872 --> 49:51.575
So, should we start our
new partnership together.. .

49:51.639 --> 49:53.874
by my drawing up an agreement
for the ne_ six months?

49:54.905 --> 49:56.941
Then tomorrow, l promise you,

49:57.006 --> 50:01.075
l will make you an offer for the use...
of the warehouse for the ne_ five years.

50:02.304 --> 50:05.307
Well thank you for your very kind offer.

50:05.904 --> 50:11.944
But l don't really want to
extend your contract, Mr. Leroy.

50:15.904 --> 50:17.840
When l rented you the warehouse,

50:17.904 --> 50:20.274
l had no idea what you'd
be putting in there.

50:20.304 --> 50:23.940
l tried to tell you what l was hoping to bring
here, but you said you didn't care to know.

50:23.970 --> 50:28.774
Still, l had no idea, no earthly
idea, that you would bring in those...

50:29.570 --> 50:31.972
-what do you call them?
-Canisters.

50:32.004 --> 50:34.172
No, l know about that. But, l
mean, what do you put in them?

50:34.237 --> 50:36.672
-Hazardous waste.
-Yes.

50:37.303 --> 50:41.508
See, l would want
them removed right now.

50:41.570 --> 50:45.139
But if you've made arrangements
for them to be here for a week.

50:45.203 --> 50:48.072
Well, l was indeed counting
on it for the ne_ six months.

50:48.136 --> 50:51.005
-That's what my contract says.
-l know and l'm sorry.

50:51.036 --> 50:53.104
l have contractual obligations on

50:53.169 --> 50:54.503
our end based on our agreement.

51:02.169 --> 51:03.970
You really insist on doing this?

51:13.868 --> 51:19.707
l have no alternative but to get
me a lamer and take you to court.

51:20.702 --> 51:23.471
l will find a way to refund your money.

51:23.535 --> 51:25.236
l don't care about the money.

51:25.301 --> 51:29.071
l care about all the work and
planning that's gone into this.

51:31.400 --> 51:33.603
Miss Willa, don't you think
your aunt is being unreasonable?

51:33.667 --> 51:37.237
No, l don't. l think
she's being very sensible.

51:37.300 --> 51:40.504
How dare you threaten her
with the law? How dare you?

51:43.900 --> 51:45.802
Have you ever heard of Vernon, Texas?

51:46.167 --> 51:46.834
No.

51:48.800 --> 51:51.169
Well, it's a town of maybe 800 people.

51:52.466 --> 51:54.134
And it was dying on the vine.

51:54.933 --> 51:57.001
Young people were leaving in droves.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.335
My company went to
the town officials.. .

51:59.366 --> 52:01.901
and offered to build them a
park and a swimming pool.. .

52:01.933 --> 52:05.269
if they would let us come in and
establish a hazardous waste facility.

52:05.833 --> 52:06.833
They agreed.

52:07.799 --> 52:11.170
And we were careful in the
planning and location of our system.

52:12.765 --> 52:15.067
We used local people whenever possible.

52:15.132 --> 52:18.535
And the town is prospering
and the people have jobs.

52:20.632 --> 52:24.936
l feel strongly about the responsibility you
take on when you get involved in all this.

52:26.398 --> 52:29.869
lf we let people who are interested
only in profits take hold.. .

52:29.932 --> 52:33.434
no one will be safe in
time. Not you, not your aunt.

52:34.198 --> 52:36.300
Not me. No one.

52:38.297 --> 52:40.566
Now l'm not saying that our
record in Vernon is perfect but.. .

52:40.598 --> 52:43.334
mistakes are corrected as
soon as they are uncovered.

52:45.331 --> 52:48.801
Well, you look at Durham's
downtown. It is dying. Literally.

52:49.797 --> 52:53.535
Now l told my company that l believe
there is an opportunity here in a place.. .

52:53.564 --> 52:56.699
that needs help, and l think
they're very interested.

52:57.130 --> 52:59.699
They're just waiting to see
how this first phase works out.

53:03.097 --> 53:07.668
l'm not your enemy, Miss
Willa... and l don't want to be.

53:13.463 --> 53:15.498
Let's stay away from lawyers and courts.

53:19.696 --> 53:20.730
Give me a month.

53:21.262 --> 53:23.697
Let me send on this bunch
of canisters to Vernon...

53:23.729 --> 53:25.697
and bring in the next
one from Louisiana.

53:26.129 --> 53:28.498
Let me talk to the city
about the plans l have.

53:29.829 --> 53:30.896
And at the end of the month.. .

53:30.929 --> 53:36.000
if you still think l'm just...
a mercenary and opportunistic,

53:36.162 --> 53:37.296
then l'll go away.

53:38.096 --> 53:41.064
l'll leave you, your
aunt and your warehouse.

53:41.128 --> 53:42.996
And you'll never hear any more from me.

53:46.428 --> 53:49.831
l'm going to go into the ne_
room And you talk it over.

53:50.828 --> 53:54.298
And then when you come to a decision
about what you want to do, you call me.

54:02.893 --> 54:04.462
Tell me what to do, Willa.

54:04.527 --> 54:07.062
No, l won't do that.
It's your warehouse.

54:09.660 --> 54:12.029
A month isn't a very long time.

54:12.694 --> 54:14.762
Would you be angry with me

54:14.827 --> 54:17.930
if l agreed he could stay on?

54:17.994 --> 54:18.627
No.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.127
Would you think l was weak?

54:23.259 --> 54:24.960
No. Not that either.

54:25.426 --> 54:27.561
The town is dying.

54:28.526 --> 54:30.694
Do you remember what it was like,

54:30.759 --> 54:33.261
how splendid it was...
when you were a girl?

54:34.926 --> 54:35.626
Yes.

54:38.826 --> 54:43.730
l thought he was very impressive when he
was talking about Vernon, Texas. Didn't you?

54:43.792 --> 54:46.194
Yes, l was impressed.

54:50.025 --> 54:54.062
Then l will agree to have
him stay for one month.

54:54.658 --> 54:56.860
-Do you agree?
-l agree.

55:04.358 --> 55:05.726
Mr. Leroy?

55:08.424 --> 55:12.861
We have decided we want
you to have your month.

55:14.857 --> 55:18.560
Thank you. You won't
regret this. l promise you.

55:22.324 --> 55:22.991
Yep.

55:24.257 --> 55:25.358
Harris is here.

55:25.824 --> 55:27.725
He said you asked him to come over.

55:28.223 --> 55:29.791
Yes, l did.

55:31.690 --> 55:32.924
He's in the living room.

55:34.256 --> 55:35.256
All right.

55:42.256 --> 55:44.992
You were a senior in high school
when this was taken, right?

55:46.090 --> 55:46.723
Yes.

55:47.823 --> 55:49.624
You haven't changed
much since high school.

55:50.888 --> 55:51.923
Oh, yes l have.

55:51.989 --> 55:53.724
Well, you can't tell by
looking at your picture.

55:56.022 --> 55:58.357
-Haven't you changed?
-l guess so.

56:02.522 --> 56:04.891
-How's law school?
-A lot of work.

56:05.888 --> 56:07.991
Still thinking about practicing here?

56:08.489 --> 56:10.357
Yeah. l do.

56:15.954 --> 56:17.889
-Harris...
-Yeah?

56:18.454 --> 56:19.655
l'm leaving Durham.

56:20.921 --> 56:23.723
-Moving to Atlanta.
-Why?

56:24.421 --> 56:27.423
l have my reasons. l'll
tell you about them someday.

56:28.354 --> 56:30.622
I’d like you to do me a favor.

56:30.854 --> 56:33.223
l want you to take me to
the airport tomorrow night.

56:33.287 --> 56:38.025
-All right. What time are you leaving?
-Nine o'clock.

56:40.520 --> 56:41.988
Why aren't your parents taking you?

56:43.786 --> 56:47.857
They'd like to, but
they're both very upset.

56:48.487 --> 56:50.956
And l think it would be
easier if we say goodbye here.

56:51.953 --> 56:53.154
Isn't this kind of sudden?

56:54.286 --> 56:55.787
Yes, l guess.

56:56.519 --> 56:58.254
When did you decide you wanted to leave?

56:58.419 --> 56:59.653
-Today.
-Today?

57:01.086 --> 57:02.086
Why Atlanta?

57:02.819 --> 57:05.621
l remembered the Wiggins twins
are there, and l called them.

57:06.452 --> 57:08.987
They said I’d have no trouble
finding a job there.. .

57:09.119 --> 57:11.387
and l could stay with
them until l did find one.

57:12.752 --> 57:14.186
What if you don't like Atlanta?

57:15.752 --> 57:17.153
Then l won't stay.

57:18.918 --> 57:22.421
l'll try Houston or New Orleans.

57:22.618 --> 57:24.686
You know anyone in
Houston or New Orleans?

57:25.451 --> 57:25.984
No.

57:26.284 --> 57:28.654
What if you don't like
Houston or New Orleans?

57:31.784 --> 57:34.454
Then l'll have to come
back here and find a job.

57:37.985 --> 57:40.086
Don't look at me like that, Harris.

57:40.150 --> 57:41.885
You're worse than Mother and Frank.

57:44.350 --> 57:48.887
Haven't you ever wanted to
leave? Are you so content?

57:50.950 --> 57:52.451
l bet if you didn't have.. .

57:56.917 --> 57:57.751
Never mind.

57:58.184 --> 58:01.319
-What were you going to say?
-Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing.

58:06.249 --> 58:07.984
l want to know what
you were going to say.

58:08.849 --> 58:11.017
l bet if you didn't have your
mother dependent on you.. .

58:11.049 --> 58:12.850
you'd be thinking about leaving too.

58:15.282 --> 58:17.852
What kind of future
is there for you here?

58:18.183 --> 58:21.553
A cop. Thirty thousand a year.

58:22.049 --> 58:24.517
-Only losers settle for that.
-You calling me a loser?

58:24.548 --> 58:27.284
l'll call you that if you stay
here, Because that's what you'll be.

58:27.381 --> 58:29.951
A loser cop. A loser lamer.

58:33.082 --> 58:34.383
Thanks a lot, Mary.

58:38.315 --> 58:39.049
Harris...

58:42.748 --> 58:43.415
Harris!

58:45.081 --> 58:45.848
Harris!

58:49.081 --> 58:50.449
l didn't mean it like that.

59:00.547 --> 59:01.881
l'm going to have to call you back.

59:05.414 --> 59:08.048
-Busy at work?
-Yes. We're shipping them out.

59:09.013 --> 59:10.948
We're expecting out ne_
shipment tomorrow night.

59:11.680 --> 59:15.417
-Will you be busy here tonight?
-No.

59:16.213 --> 59:18.582
Would you be able to have
dinner at Aunt Georgiana's?

59:18.646 --> 59:22.049
She's decided to sell her house.
She thinks it'll sell right away.. .

59:22.846 --> 59:24.847
and this is the last chance
for her to cook in her kitchen.

59:24.913 --> 59:28.483
She would be so pleased
if you could join us.

59:28.646 --> 59:31.781
-What time?
-What time is good for you?

59:33.179 --> 59:33.879
Six.

59:43.945 --> 59:46.881
Tomorrow night, l have an appointment
with the Mayor and the City Council.

59:46.945 --> 59:48.079
I’d like it if you can be there

59:48.112 --> 59:49.780
and let me know how you
think the meeting went.

59:50.079 --> 59:51.712
-What time will that be?
-Seven.

59:53.244 --> 59:54.144
l'll be there.

01:00:02.578 --> 01:00:04.079
-Hello?
-Miss Willa?

01:00:04.144 --> 01:00:06.279
-Yes.
-lt's Crosby here from the real estate office.

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:07.445
How are you Crosby?

01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:10.314
Oh, l'm very well, thank
you. l'm sorry to trouble you.

01:00:10.377 --> 01:00:13.513
May l have a word with your
aunt? l'll just be a second.

01:00:13.577 --> 01:00:14.444
l'll get her.

01:00:15.743 --> 01:00:17.077
lt's for you, Auntie

01:00:24.743 --> 01:00:26.744
-Yes.
-Miss Georgiana?

01:00:27.577 --> 01:00:28.277
Yes?

01:00:28.343 --> 01:00:31.112
l have a Miss Lucy Calhoun who's
interested in viewing tomorrow night.

01:00:31.177 --> 01:00:33.212
-Oh good heavens.
-She's very rich and knows the house.

01:00:33.276 --> 01:00:37.480
Why does she want to come tomorrow night?
Why doesn't she come in the daytime?

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:39.077
That's what works for her.

01:00:40.942 --> 01:00:43.044
Oh, all right. Thank you.

01:00:43.875 --> 01:00:48.080
Well, he has this very rich
lady who passes the house often.

01:00:48.142 --> 01:00:49.810
She has lots of money.. .

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:52.845
and she wants to come tomorrow
night and go through my home.

01:00:52.909 --> 01:00:56.278
-What time will that be?
-Seven o'clock.

01:00:56.941 --> 01:01:00.377
l would be ever indebted to you
if you could be here with me.

01:01:00.441 --> 01:01:03.277
Well, I’d like to be here,
Auntie, but l promised Mr. Leroy...

01:01:03.341 --> 01:01:07.344
I’d be at his meeting with the Mayor
and the City Council tomorrow at seven.

01:01:07.374 --> 01:01:09.910
Oh, honey, don't leave me
alone here, tomorrow night.

01:01:09.975 --> 01:01:13.611
l will be ever in your debt if
you'll just do this one thing for me.

01:01:13.641 --> 01:01:15.776
All right, all right.
Don't worry. l will.

01:01:26.907 --> 01:01:28.108
You're very prompt.

01:01:28.174 --> 01:01:32.845
l can't be with you tomorrow night
at the meeting after all, Mr. Leroy.

01:01:33.074 --> 01:01:36.377
Auntie has a rich lady
interested in her house...

01:01:36.807 --> 01:01:38.475
and she can only come
to see it tomorrow night.

01:01:39.074 --> 01:01:40.007
Auntie was in a panic

01:01:40.039 --> 01:01:41.840
over being alone with her
and the real estate agent.. .

01:01:41.872 --> 01:01:44.475
-and l promised her I’d be here.
-l understand.

01:01:45.239 --> 01:01:50.143
Well, l'll come over after the meeting
if l may and tell you how l think it went.

01:01:50.839 --> 01:01:51.873
I’d like that.

01:01:52.439 --> 01:01:56.643
Mr. Leroy. l'm so glad
you could be with us.

01:01:56.939 --> 01:02:01.043
At this may be the last meal
l'll ever cook in this house.

01:02:01.306 --> 01:02:04.141
Come in. l have soup waiting for us.

01:02:10.105 --> 01:02:16.010
Now, Mr. Leroy, you can sit at the head
and we'll sit on either side of you.

01:02:28.071 --> 01:02:28.971
Thank you.

01:02:51.103 --> 01:02:52.804
This is delicious, Miss Georgiana.

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:54.870
Oh thank you, sir.

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:07.403
You're selling your house?

01:03:10.868 --> 01:03:11.703
Yes.

01:03:17.135 --> 01:03:20.705
l'm sorry. Forgive me. Forgive me.

01:03:22.835 --> 01:03:24.536
l feel so stupid. Maybe l better go.

01:03:24.602 --> 01:03:27.371
No, please don't. l'll go see her.

01:03:27.435 --> 01:03:30.303
My aunt is very emotional
about selling the house.

01:03:30.367 --> 01:03:35.005
She was born in this house, you
know. She's never lived anyplace else.

01:03:52.967 --> 01:03:57.604
That was her father. My
grandfather, James Wilfred Carr.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.136
-Were you born in this house too?
-No. No.

01:04:02.667 --> 01:04:04.602
-Were you born in Durham?
-Yes.

01:04:06.233 --> 01:04:08.702
My mother and Aunt
Georgiana were sisters.

01:04:08.766 --> 01:04:11.035
l left here at 22 when l got married.

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.701
Went to live in Texas.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:16.636
-Texas?
-Yes. Were you born in Texas?

01:04:16.666 --> 01:04:19.735
-Yes.
-Your family there?

01:04:19.799 --> 01:04:22.334
No. No, my mother and father are dead.

01:04:23.599 --> 01:04:27.336
l have no brothers or
sisters. l'm divorced too.

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.333
My work, l guess, is my family.

01:04:35.098 --> 01:04:35.832
Mr. Leroy.. .

01:04:35.898 --> 01:04:41.036
Please don't call me Mr.
Leroy and Mr. Gus. Call me Gus.

01:04:41.898 --> 01:04:45.301
-Gus it will be.
-Thank you, Willa.

01:04:46.431 --> 01:04:47.932
You're welcome, Gus.. ..

01:04:51.731 --> 01:04:53.499
-Gus...
-Yes?

01:04:57.263 --> 01:04:59.165
Never mind. l'll ask you later.

01:04:59.897 --> 01:05:01.765
You still worried about the canisters?

01:05:03.863 --> 01:05:06.533
Yes. How safe they are.

01:05:06.597 --> 01:05:08.231
lf l get interest from
the Council tomorrow,

01:05:08.263 --> 01:05:10.032
and my company likes
what they have to say.. .

01:05:10.064 --> 01:05:11.598
things can move very fast.

01:05:11.997 --> 01:05:14.199
-l'm sure.
-l'm going to need an assistant.

01:05:16.164 --> 01:05:18.332
Do you know of anyone
you could recommend?

01:05:19.229 --> 01:05:21.764
l would prefer someone who
knows Durham and its people.

01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:25.199
-How old?
-Someone mature and dependable.

01:05:25.229 --> 01:05:28.465
Would be interested in what
we're hoping to achieve here.

01:05:28.596 --> 01:05:31.398
Well, let me think on it. No
one comes to mind right off.

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:36.830
Would you be interested?

01:05:39.463 --> 01:05:44.967
Why heavens. l don't know.
It never occurred to me.

01:05:47.761 --> 01:05:49.663
I’d be interested in working with you.

01:05:52.395 --> 01:05:54.730
Well goodness. l'm very flattered.

01:05:55.495 --> 01:06:00.933
l don't know. l know so
little about all of this.

01:06:01.895 --> 01:06:04.730
-Would you think about it?
-Well, yes, l suppose so.

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:08.130
-l mean seriously think about it.
-l will certainly.

01:06:09.927 --> 01:06:11.428
When would you need to know?

01:06:20.694 --> 01:06:22.796
l promise not to do that again.

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:39.228
-All right. See you tomorrow.
-Maybe.

01:06:39.993 --> 01:06:42.628
-lt's supposed to rain tomorrow.
-That's right.

01:06:47.659 --> 01:06:48.459
Harris.. .

01:06:54.892 --> 01:06:57.928
-l didn't mean you were...
-l know what you meant.

01:07:05.825 --> 01:07:07.493
l'm too sensitive for my own good.

01:07:09.257 --> 01:07:10.692
And l want to tell you something.

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:14.293
l think we're both too
sensitive for our own good.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.590
-Yes.
-Miss Georgiana? Crosby here.

01:08:25.654 --> 01:08:31.093
Oh hello Crosby. Isn't this
rain something? Oh goodness me.

01:08:31.554 --> 01:08:34.424
l'm sorry, but our lady's
temporarily canceled.

01:08:35.287 --> 01:08:37.322
She's unable to make
it out in this rain.

01:08:37.819 --> 01:08:40.455
-l see.
-My apologies.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.522
But you think she's
definitely interested?

01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:45.555
Most definitely she is!

01:08:46.987 --> 01:08:49.889
Oh. Well, thank you for calling me.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.888
That was Crosby.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:58.022
Seems our lady customer has canceled.

01:08:58.086 --> 01:09:01.421
Too much rain, she says, to venture out.

01:09:01.886 --> 01:09:05.356
But he says she's still very interested.

01:09:07.019 --> 01:09:08.987
Oh, l'm so disappointed.

01:09:12.252 --> 01:09:14.488
Why risk flying in this rain?

01:09:14.953 --> 01:09:16.453
Can't she wait until tomorrow?

01:09:18.118 --> 01:09:22.654
-No, she's determined to leave.
-What if her flight is canceled?

01:09:22.718 --> 01:09:24.185
She says she'll take the bus.

01:09:24.685 --> 01:09:25.952
God she's stubborn.

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:31.221
-You raised a stubborn daughter.
-You raised her too.

01:09:31.285 --> 01:09:33.053
Why does she want Harris
to take her to the airport?

01:09:33.085 --> 01:09:34.319
Why can't we take her?

01:09:34.385 --> 01:09:36.620
She says she wants to
say goodbye to us here.

01:09:37.984 --> 01:09:40.220
Oh Frank, l'm going to miss her.

01:09:40.252 --> 01:09:41.685
Now, Miriam, come on.

01:09:42.651 --> 01:09:44.752
Please.. .Come on.

01:09:45.484 --> 01:09:46.350
lt's Harris.

01:09:49.984 --> 01:09:50.651
Come on in.

01:09:53.151 --> 01:09:56.254
-Hello folks.
-Mary! Harris is here.

01:09:58.151 --> 01:10:00.219
Frank, go help her with her bags.

01:10:00.751 --> 01:10:01.618
Yeah.

01:10:09.483 --> 01:10:12.519
Were you surprised when
you heard she was going?

01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:16.185
Yes, Ma'am. l was.

01:10:19.283 --> 01:10:21.151
Promise me you'll call
when you get to Atlanta.

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:23.184
- l don't care what time it is.
-Yes, Ma'am.

01:10:23.983 --> 01:10:24.916
l love you both.

01:10:43.848 --> 01:10:45.417
lt's a terrible night tonight, isn't it?

01:10:47.047 --> 01:10:49.083
Yeah. It is.

01:10:55.414 --> 01:10:56.281
They're gone.

01:11:00.814 --> 01:11:02.282
She's on her way.

01:11:13.947 --> 01:11:16.649
Gus Leroy.. ..Yes, Mr. Bob.

01:11:19.113 --> 01:11:21.081
l had the Louisiana
team start very early

01:11:21.113 --> 01:11:23.782
because of the rain. Around five.

01:11:25.747 --> 01:11:28.149
lt wasn't daylight yet
when they left Louisiana

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:29.447
and hadn't started raining.

01:11:32.279 --> 01:11:33.647
Yes, sir, it's raining now.

01:11:37.045 --> 01:11:38.247
l'll keep you posted.

01:11:47.979 --> 01:11:50.948
Thank you all for coming
on such a rainy night,

01:11:50.979 --> 01:11:52.379
and on such short notice.

01:11:53.211 --> 01:11:58.049
But l felt it was important for the
well being and prosperity of our city.. .

01:11:58.344 --> 01:12:00.814
that we listen to what
this gentleman has to say.

01:12:00.945 --> 01:12:04.114
-Where is he?
-Well, he'll be here in a few minutes

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:07.114
and l want him to explain...

01:12:07.311 --> 01:12:09.046
who he is and why he
wants to come here.. .

01:12:09.311 --> 01:12:11.713
and what he thinks he
can do for our city.

01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:26.045
-You look very pretty.
-Thank you.

01:12:26.343 --> 01:12:27.311
You had a bath?

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:30.178
Yes, l feel so much better.

01:12:34.177 --> 01:12:36.711
How long do you think
that meeting will be?

01:12:37.209 --> 01:12:40.612
l have no idea. l presume
no more than an hour.

01:12:40.842 --> 01:12:43.478
What if they turn his project down

01:12:43.909 --> 01:12:46.478
and say he can't start a plant here.

01:12:46.842 --> 01:12:51.280
Do you think he'll still be able
to rent my warehouse for five years?

01:12:51.342 --> 01:12:52.143
l don't know.

01:12:54.076 --> 01:12:56.044
l've begun to worry about that.

01:13:01.341 --> 01:13:03.277
l feel they won't turn him down.

01:13:03.308 --> 01:13:07.545
Well, if the meeting only lasts one
hour, then he should be here pretty soon.

01:13:07.875 --> 01:13:09.643
lf he comes right away.

01:13:10.242 --> 01:13:11.977
He may have to stay and talk to people.

01:13:13.875 --> 01:13:16.210
Do you think l'll find
a buyer for my house?

01:13:16.242 --> 01:13:17.209
l think so.

01:13:17.875 --> 01:13:21.277
Crosby Gaige has total
confidence that l will.

01:13:21.441 --> 01:13:22.441
He should know.

01:13:22.741 --> 01:13:25.944
Crosby says that a lot of his customers
buy houses, pay all kinds of money.. .

01:13:25.974 --> 01:13:29.577
for them, and then tear them
down and build a new one.

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:32.575
Are you listening to me?

01:13:33.941 --> 01:13:37.344
l'm sorry. l was thinking
about Gus and his meeting.

01:13:37.574 --> 01:13:38.942
Gus. Who's Gus?

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:42.674
Mr. Leroy?

01:13:44.573 --> 01:13:45.373
Yes.

01:13:45.873 --> 01:13:49.142
Well, since when did you
start calling him Gus?

01:13:49.606 --> 01:13:50.640
He asked me to.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:57.942
Are you interested in him, Willa?

01:13:58.906 --> 01:14:00.774
What do you mean interested?

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.175
l mean interested.

01:14:04.372 --> 01:14:05.206
l don't know.

01:14:06.538 --> 01:14:10.075
-What do you mean you don't know, honey?
-l mean, l don't know.

01:14:17.472 --> 01:14:20.141
Yes l do. l am.

01:14:20.605 --> 01:14:22.840
Is he interested in you?

01:14:23.939 --> 01:14:24.906
l don't know.

01:14:30.971 --> 01:14:32.172
l think he is.

01:14:34.238 --> 01:14:35.205
l hope so.

01:14:41.471 --> 01:14:45.007
Frank thinks it's foolish
flying in weather like this.

01:14:45.071 --> 01:14:48.239
But he'd think it was foolish my
leaving if the sun was shining.

01:14:51.536 --> 01:14:54.773
-He's my stepfather, you know.
-Yeah, l knew that.

01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:56.871
l knew it, Mary.

01:15:00.103 --> 01:15:01.804
l never knew my real father.

01:15:05.303 --> 01:15:07.204
He's dead now, Mama says.

01:15:14.469 --> 01:15:16.470
Well, l couldn't have had
a better father than Frank.

01:15:20.369 --> 01:15:22.537
How old were you when your father died?

01:15:24.469 --> 01:15:25.436
Five.

01:15:26.636 --> 01:15:27.737
Do you remember him?

01:15:28.502 --> 01:15:30.637
l think l do, but 'm never really sure.

01:15:32.901 --> 01:15:34.435
Were you named for your father?

01:15:36.368 --> 01:15:38.403
No. My brother Pete was named for him.

01:15:40.201 --> 01:15:41.468
Where is Pete?

01:15:42.834 --> 01:15:45.671
l don't know. Pete's a wanderer.

01:15:46.968 --> 01:15:48.469
We always finally hear from him.

01:15:48.534 --> 01:15:50.403
lt may be six months or a year.

01:15:51.101 --> 01:15:52.335
And then we'll get a letter or a card

01:15:52.368 --> 01:15:55.703
saying he misses us and sends his love.

01:16:08.134 --> 01:16:08.834
Mary?

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:13.801
Yes, Harris?

01:16:17.766 --> 01:16:18.900
l'm in love with you.

01:16:27.032 --> 01:16:28.167
Always have been.

01:16:31.766 --> 01:16:33.300
l'm in love with you too.

01:16:37.598 --> 01:16:39.333
Always have been.

01:16:47.165 --> 01:16:49.734
l'm here to talk about what l like
to talk about more than anything.

01:16:49.765 --> 01:16:51.299
Managing our waste.

01:16:52.531 --> 01:16:56.602
Well, first of all, I’d like you to
know that l am a paid employee, and proud

01:16:56.632 --> 01:16:59.567
to be of the Environmental
Services Corporation.

01:16:59.731 --> 01:17:01.966
We have offices in Houston, San Antonio,

01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:03.732
and a plant near Vernon, Texas...

01:17:03.764 --> 01:17:06.266
a small Texas town of about 800 people,

01:17:06.697 --> 01:17:08.598
that made me and my company welcome.

01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:10.865
As some of you also may know.. .

01:17:11.764 --> 01:17:15.300
we were able to lease the
warehouse of Miss Georgiana Carr.. .

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:18.901
to store some of our canisters
containing hazardous waste.

01:17:20.163 --> 01:17:24.967
l've sat here so many days and
nights listening to the rain.

01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:37.834
l'm getting used to the idea
that my days here are almost over.

01:17:38.829 --> 01:17:40.565
Now we go all over the Unit_ States...

01:17:40.596 --> 01:17:43.564
looking for products to bring
back to our Vernon plant.. .

01:17:43.929 --> 01:17:46.398
which converts toxic waste into a form

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:49.731
that may be safely
buried or disposed of.

01:17:56.662 --> 01:18:01.633
We would like in time to build
a sister plant here in Durham.

01:18:02.195 --> 01:18:04.262
l've seen weddings in this room

01:18:06.861 --> 01:18:08.762
and funerals start from here.

01:18:12.461 --> 01:18:15.997
Your mama and daddy were
married in this room.

01:18:16.527 --> 01:18:18.196
l was the maid of honor.

01:18:18.928 --> 01:18:22.164
Now l know the question on all of
your minds is how safe is all this?

01:18:23.661 --> 01:18:25.662
Well, let me begin that
discussion by reminding you.. .

01:18:25.694 --> 01:18:29.496
that we now live in a nuclear
age and all of its complexity.

01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:35.096
No house pictured
here is still standing.

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.196
The atomic bomb locked
up is of no danger.

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.961
The danger only comes when it's dropped.

01:18:41.026 --> 01:18:42.995
Therefore, waste of any kind

01:18:43.193 --> 01:18:45.194
hazardous, toxic or nuclear

01:18:45.227 --> 01:18:48.162
cannot harm you if it
is properly managed.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:55.297
In gratitude to our friends in
Vernon, for their cooperation.. .

01:18:55.325 --> 01:19:00.364
we have built them a beautiful new
park and a community swimming pool.

01:19:01.459 --> 01:19:02.827
To show our appreciation.

01:19:03.726 --> 01:19:06.195
And they have almost full
employment in that town.

01:19:06.559 --> 01:19:09.827
And old Durham itself
is half demolished.

01:19:11.925 --> 01:19:14.093
Where did the houses go?

01:19:17.491 --> 01:19:19.392
Where did the city go?

01:19:19.725 --> 01:19:22.260
l want to say to you what l
say to my friends in Vernon.

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:25.695
l refuse to live in the
past. l look to the future.

01:19:27.824 --> 01:19:30.093
Emergency 1 183. Hazmat.

01:19:30.158 --> 01:19:31.958
All units on duty respond.

01:19:32.124 --> 01:19:35.961
-What in the world is that about?
-l have to see. I'm sorry.

01:19:36.157 --> 01:19:38.058
Car 104. 1017.

01:19:39.957 --> 01:19:43.493
l would like to say l am very
impressed with what l just heard.

01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:46.559
And as a member of Council,
l would like to recommend.. .

01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:50.860
that we get in touch with
whoever we need to in Vernon...

01:19:50.924 --> 01:19:54.026
Texas, and let them know of
our serious interest in this.

01:19:54.889 --> 01:19:59.159
Will the Council members that agree
with Shirley's request raise their hands?

01:20:17.588 --> 01:20:18.689
You stay here, Mary.

01:20:19.422 --> 01:20:22.591
l don't want to stay here by
myself. l want to go with you.

01:20:24.321 --> 01:20:27.491
All right. Come on. But
stay where it's safe.

01:20:33.088 --> 01:20:34.689
Were you at the scene of the accident?

01:20:35.155 --> 01:20:38.357
No, sir. All l know is the reports
l've been getting on my scanner.

01:20:38.921 --> 01:20:40.455
Are you going as fast as you can?

01:20:40.654 --> 01:20:41.254
Yes, sir.

01:20:52.454 --> 01:20:53.922
Are you all right lady?

01:20:57.087 --> 01:21:00.923
No one was killed. l'm
grateful to my maker for that.

01:21:03.586 --> 01:21:06.255
These trucks were
transporting hazardous waste.

01:21:06.353 --> 01:21:07.954
Get the Hazmat team from Raleigh.

01:21:07.986 --> 01:21:09.420
l'll see to the canisters.

01:21:09.553 --> 01:21:12.756
We got a couple of guys on the ground
that are going to need immediate attention.

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.120
Jesus. Jesus.

01:21:41.085 --> 01:21:43.419
-Mister Leroy.
-Yes.

01:21:44.118 --> 01:21:46.019
Are you wondering about your canisters?

01:21:47.017 --> 01:21:48.519
The Hazmat team from Raleigh

01:21:48.551 --> 01:21:50.719
came as soon as they were
summoned... and inspected them.

01:21:52.118 --> 01:21:53.919
They say they haven't been hurt at all.

01:21:55.151 --> 01:21:56.852
They want us to get
them in to your warehouse

01:21:56.884 --> 01:21:59.086
as soon as possible. l
understand it's empty.

01:21:59.584 --> 01:22:03.721
lt is. Do you have men
to help you move them?

01:22:03.784 --> 01:22:05.885
We do. We got in touch
with your supervisors

01:22:05.917 --> 01:22:07.451
Jose and Estaquio.

01:22:07.483 --> 01:22:09.885
They hired a team of men to move
the canisters into the trucks.. .

01:22:09.917 --> 01:22:11.485
and unload them at the warehouse.

01:22:15.183 --> 01:22:16.484
Then l'm not needed?

01:22:16.883 --> 01:22:20.753
No, sir. Not really.

01:22:46.549 --> 01:22:47.683
Here you are, sir.

01:22:47.815 --> 01:22:51.552
-Thank you. Be well.
-Be well.

01:22:54.581 --> 01:22:55.281
Thank you.

01:24:03.378 --> 01:24:04.112
Hello.

01:24:07.478 --> 01:24:08.145
Hello.

01:24:11.778 --> 01:24:13.779
l'm so sorry about the accident.

01:24:15.478 --> 01:24:16.744
l may be fired.

01:24:18.911 --> 01:24:20.279
lf there had been any fatalities.. .

01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:21.912
or if any of the
canisters had been damaged,

01:24:21.944 --> 01:24:23.245
l surely would have been.

01:24:24.911 --> 01:24:28.414
Now l'm being accused of negligence...

01:24:30.444 --> 01:24:33.346
and the company will decide
later today whether l can stay on.

01:24:37.776 --> 01:24:38.843
l'm sorry.

01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:50.911
Back home l knew of an old man

01:24:51.076 --> 01:24:52.977
that l only saw once from a distance.

01:24:54.210 --> 01:24:56.045
He had a room at the local hotel.

01:24:58.476 --> 01:24:59.609
l was a paperboy then.. .

01:24:59.642 --> 01:25:01.610
and l used to bring
his paper to his room.

01:25:03.342 --> 01:25:04.609
When l announced who l was.. .

01:25:04.675 --> 01:25:07.811
he opened the door just wide enough
to stick his hand out to get his paper.

01:25:10.675 --> 01:25:11.876
He never left his room.

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:15.743
He had all his meals sent up there too.

01:25:16.909 --> 01:25:19.344
When he was a young man, he had
an accident that happened to him.

01:25:20.642 --> 01:25:22.509
No one could remember what it was.

01:25:24.774 --> 01:25:27.576
But it frightened him so
he'd never leave his room

01:25:27.641 --> 01:25:29.109
for fear of another accident.

01:25:32.874 --> 01:25:35.009
Last night has given
me a fear of accidents.

01:25:38.041 --> 01:25:39.942
Fear of the deadliness of accidents.

01:25:41.908 --> 01:25:44.109
You should see what an
accident did to those trucks.

01:25:46.473 --> 01:25:48.241
What it might have
done to the canisters.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.075
How do you pass a law against accidents?

01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:01.877
Suppose all the canisters held
up in this crash, but one didn't?

01:26:05.772 --> 01:26:07.173
Well you know what would happen.

01:26:15.372 --> 01:26:17.240
So l'm going to resign from the company.

01:26:20.672 --> 01:26:22.306
l'm tired of being a cheerleader.

01:26:25.672 --> 01:26:27.139
l'm going to be a truth teller.

01:26:28.405 --> 01:26:31.474
The truth is, accidents happen.

01:26:32.304 --> 01:26:36.075
Rainy days. Sunny days.
Always the unexpected.

01:26:37.371 --> 01:26:38.805
l'm going to have to
tell your aunt that.

01:26:48.904 --> 01:26:53.642
Mr. Leroy. l'm sure Willa has told you

01:26:53.937 --> 01:26:56.506
how distressed we were
over what happened.

01:26:57.237 --> 01:26:57.870
Yes.

01:26:58.604 --> 01:27:01.006
Crosby's customer is buying my house.

01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:03.338
Her name is Lucy Calhoun.

01:27:03.404 --> 01:27:06.306
We've signed all the papers and
l've received the down payment.

01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:09.473
And she's lovely, Lucy
Calhoun. She's just lovely.

01:27:09.537 --> 01:27:11.537
l feel as if l've known her all my life.

01:27:12.069 --> 01:27:15.405
Oh, and she said the sweetest thing

01:27:15.936 --> 01:27:20.073
That our being brought together
in such a harmonious way.. .

01:27:20.236 --> 01:27:24.473
she felt was surely divine intervention.

01:27:24.936 --> 01:27:28.205
-Not just an accident.
-Certainly not.

01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:34.540
l never would have thought of it if
dear Lucy Calhoun hadn't brought it up.

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:40.339
Look. Look. The sun is out.

01:27:43.301 --> 01:27:45.103
The rain is gone.

01:27:50.702 --> 01:27:53.571
Oh, what a lovely day it will be.

01:28:04.467 --> 01:28:06.202
This city, like many in America

01:28:06.867 --> 01:28:08.668
has come to a rough
moment in its history.

01:28:09.767 --> 01:28:12.970
A city, after all, is just a
collection of houses and buildings ...

01:28:13.467 --> 01:28:16.702
hopes and dreams that depend on
the fortune and determination...

01:28:16.733 --> 01:28:18.367
and the faith of its residents.

01:28:19.966 --> 01:28:22.968
The future, uncertain at best, can be

01:28:23.033 --> 01:28:25.201
fearful or full of promise.

01:28:27.066 --> 01:28:28.467
lt's all in how you see it.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:40.000
<i><b><font color="blue" size=50>...:::: SiliconChip ::::...</font></b></i>

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:37.500
