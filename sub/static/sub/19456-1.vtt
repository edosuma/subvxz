SUSAN:
It's not easy spending a day in the city

02:01.720 --> 02:04.076
with two kids around Christmastime,

02:05.440 --> 02:09.229
even if you have taken them
to a matinee and outdoor skating.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.600
I'd had to fight with them,
with Danny in particular,

02:13.760 --> 02:18.715
to get them aboard the 3:55 back
to the suburbs in time for dinner.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.115

03:22.320 --> 03:23.879

03:24.040 --> 03:26.790

03:27.320 --> 03:28.356

You, not hungry?

03:42.640 --> 03:43.710
You're always hungry.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.909
Did you get them something to eat

03:47.120 --> 03:48.349
when you were out?

03:48.640 --> 03:49.756
Just hot chocolate.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.798

- Nope.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.752
No, I skipped it.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.239

untouched again, you know.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.356
Really?

05:26.920 --> 05:30.798
He was probably sneaking junk food
in the cafeteria or something.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.436
I think we should make
an appointment with Dr. Weller.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.673
Maybe he's coming down with something.

05:42.680 --> 05:46.155
I'm sure it's just some stunt he's pulling
to get out of going to school.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.635
I wouldn't worry about it.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.754
Well, I am starting to get worried.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.880
Look, he doesn't have a fever.

05:52.960 --> 05:57.156
And even if he has the flu, there's nothing
Dr. Weller can do for him anyway.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.795
I guess so.

ROBERT:
Listen, buddy, you gotta eat something.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.872
Danny, why didn't you eat
the lunch I made you today?

06:21.720 --> 06:23.120
I didn't feel like it.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.596

06:27.920 --> 06:29.115

It better not be the chickenpox.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.879
Amanda Dewsbury had the chickenpox,

06:50.040 --> 06:52.351
and she didn't show up for school
for, like, an entire week.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.916
She was covered in, like,
these disgusting, oozing sores...

06:55.080 --> 06:58.754

and hopefully, uh,
it'll give us a clearer picture.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.392

- No.
- No.

some emotional problems.

that I can recommend for you.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.913
No, a therapist, and don't worry.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.270

get to the bottom of this.

is to call me every day

10:56.440 --> 10:58.837

doing, if he's eating.

That's the... what you're supposed to say.

42:01.440 --> 42:04.113
Older than that,
predates Native Americans for sure.

before the Native Americans

42:15.120 --> 42:16.839
be called Native Americans?

42:51.560 --> 42:52.710
It's nice.

that I booked in the... in the park,

42:57.160 --> 42:58.640
that was also really nice.

42:58.840 --> 43:00.035
That had showers.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.271
And it had screaming children.

43:02.440 --> 43:05.274
And paths where you can walk
and not get lost and...

43:05.440 --> 43:08.954

Natural Ice cans from frat bros.

You are. You always...

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.037
(SHOUTS) I'm more than that, Mom!

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.836
Sometimes, I just wanna hurt you...

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.640
rip you to pieces.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.393
Don't say things like that.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.233
I have dreams

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:05.711
of an empire of misery.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.600
Oh, honey, please stop
saying things like that.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.160
I want you to kneel.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.511
What?

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.908
I said kneel.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.035
Kneel before me.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:41.470
That's it.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.229
Now crawl to me.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.110
Oh, honey.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.273
I wanna go live with Dad now.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.069
You're my boy.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.437
You'll always be my boy.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.638
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.680
I've got you, honey.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.280
- Don't look at him.
- (FLIES BUZZING)

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.874
Just close your eyes.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.440
Listen to the story.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.513
At first, you made me so unwell.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.076
God, I had never felt so awful
as those first three months.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.238
I ate raw liver and saltines, and other
than that, I couldn't keep a thing down.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:01.874
You just took the life out of me,
and you took and took

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.872
until one day, I said, "I've had enough."

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.236
And I swear, honey,

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.196
deep in my belly, you heard me cry.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.956
You heard how much pain I was in,

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.358
because you and I are bonded,

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.759
no matter who your father is.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.792
(SIGHS) The perversion.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.957
It's something unholy they did to me.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.714
And when I found out those sick people
wanted you for their own,

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.440
I went to the doctor
I should have seen in the first place,

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.396
and I told him our crazy story,
and Andy, Andy, he believed me.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.438
And he gave us enough money
to leave the city,

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.711
and we've been running ever since.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:40.672
That doctor's kindness,
that's proof of God, Andy.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.797
(SPUTTERING)

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.875
I had never learned to take care
of myself until that day,

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.794
that day I found out
they wanted you for their own.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.874
I had to choose my old life or you,
and I chose you, Andy.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.679
I'm choosing you again now.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.600
Please...

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.160
it's too big, Mom.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.955
He's too big.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:07.116
Through the new schools and the chickenpox
and the loneliness, where was he?

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:11.313
He never made an appearance, only now,
now that I've done all the heavy lifting.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.914
Well, I'm not finished.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.470
He doesn't get to make the choice.

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.720
You make it.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.113
You make it.
