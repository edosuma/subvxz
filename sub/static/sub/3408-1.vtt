00:02.660 --> 00:07.340
"Beautiful memory, most precious
and most treacherous sister.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.380
"What temples must we build for you?

00:10.480 --> 00:14.700
"And even then,
how belatedly you open to us.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.644
"Even then, with what exuberance
you cross us."

02:16.591 --> 02:18.860
Hi. Thanks for coming.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.020
I'm gonna read from...

02:21.520 --> 02:23.540
a series of poems.

02:23.640 --> 02:27.620
They're written in long lines to...

02:27.720 --> 02:32.180
give a feeling of... how we
actually speak to each other.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.100
"I slip up on her, hook her narrow neck,

02:39.200 --> 02:40.820
"haul her to me,

02:40.920 --> 02:44.444
"hold her for a moment, let her go.

02:45.420 --> 02:48.364
"Maybe the right words
were there all along.

02:49.980 --> 02:53.045
"Complicity. Wonder.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.210
"How pure we were then.

02:58.600 --> 03:02.220
"Before Rimbaud, before Blake.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.921
"Grace, love.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.660
"Take care of us.

03:08.505 --> 03:09.781
"Take care of us.

03:10.706 --> 03:11.820
"Please."

03:20.380 --> 03:21.260
Move your hand.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.060
Let 'em do their thing.
They're thinking...

03:23.160 --> 03:25.100
- That's the thinking vein?
- Yes.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.020
- Move your hand.
- No, don't touch it.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.500
Let me see. Move your hand.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.140
If I think about veins,
I'm gonna pass out.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.420
- Okay, let me see.
- Oh, my God.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.780
- You got me thinking about 'em.
- Let me see!

03:38.967 --> 03:42.540
Well, how about you...

03:43.040 --> 03:46.500
- stop thinking?
- Yeah, and?

03:46.600 --> 03:50.366
And pay attention to me.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.580
Like literary things. Like I walk down
the street and I have a purpose.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.380
I am... I have a mission.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.300
You walk down the street and you go,

04:05.400 --> 04:07.900
"Oh, look at that. Shiny things and..."

04:08.000 --> 04:09.700
Shiny things? What? I don't...

04:09.800 --> 04:14.460
Yeah, or just a light will hit a wall
and you'll stare at it for a while.

04:14.560 --> 04:19.220
You get distracted easily.
Or inspired, however you want to say it.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.459
Feel like I maybe
just got you a little mad.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.940
- No, just...
- Are you sure?

04:23.040 --> 04:24.420
No, no, whatever.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.860
- Where's the pots?
- I'll get them out in a second.

04:27.960 --> 04:32.760
Hey. Hey! Come here.
I'm totally kidding, I promise.

04:32.864 --> 04:37.720
Hey. I'm so sorry.
I am. I'm so, so, so sorry.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.983
Alright, so you put your hands like this.
Don't ask me why. Are you getting old?

04:50.083 --> 04:53.500
I know, it's your hips. Alright, here we go.
Ready? And you go like this.

04:59.525 --> 05:01.963
Ai! Not so hard.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.660
If I do it, I'm gonna do it hard.

05:03.760 --> 05:07.500
No. Why can't you ever listen to me?

05:07.600 --> 05:10.960
- I do listen to you.
- No, you don't! You never listen to me.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.120
What do you mean?

05:14.160 --> 05:17.460
What? Sit around, don't do anything...

05:17.560 --> 05:19.100
It's fun.

05:19.200 --> 05:23.221
Yeah, but, you know,
I have things I want to do.

05:26.480 --> 05:30.166
- What, and I don't?
- I don't know. Do you?

05:32.160 --> 05:37.020
I don't think that we always have to be
on the go. I just don't share that. I don't.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.280
I think it's okay to sometimes just stop
and breathe for two seconds.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.384
I don't see anything wrong with it.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.730
I'll be back.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.904
Good evening.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.100
My name is C.K. Williams.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.100
And...

06:47.600 --> 06:50.685
these are poems that I wrote...

06:51.460 --> 06:52.540
in my 20s...

06:52.840 --> 06:57.921
loosely based on experiences I've had.

06:58.720 --> 07:01.820
This one's called 'My Mother's Lips'.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.140
"Until I asked her
to please stop doing it

07:05.240 --> 07:07.208
"and was astonished to find..."

07:11.135 --> 07:13.660
"Until I asked her
to please stop doing it..."

07:13.760 --> 07:15.450
"Until I..."

07:23.080 --> 07:25.721
'My Mother's Lips'.

07:26.340 --> 07:29.758
"It's endearing to watch us again
in that long-ago dusk,

07:29.858 --> 07:33.103
"facing each other, my mother and me.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.900
"I've grown to her height,
or just past it."

07:42.337 --> 07:45.180
- Okay.
- "Now the unison suddenly breaks.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.500
"I have to go on by myself.

07:47.600 --> 07:51.980
"No maestro, no score to follow.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.940
"There are our lips moving together..."

07:55.040 --> 07:57.122
'My Mother's Lips'.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.060
You want pancakes?

08:04.934 --> 08:06.020
No.

08:06.830 --> 08:09.366
- Eggs?
- No.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.243
Remember what happened last night?

08:26.280 --> 08:28.801
I don't want to talk about it.

08:28.901 --> 08:29.945
Okay.

08:36.059 --> 08:37.789
Eat.

08:47.720 --> 08:51.800
Daddy! Daddy!

08:57.485 --> 08:58.889
What is it, Charlie?

09:00.720 --> 09:03.361
I need you to go to sleep.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.820
Please!
For the love of God, go to sleep.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.820
I don't want you to wake up
until tomorrow morning.

09:09.020 --> 09:11.980
Listen to me. Hey.
I want you to go to sleep, alright?

09:12.080 --> 09:13.460
Okay? I'm getting tired
of this, Charlie.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.467
Hey, Charlie! Come on.

10:06.140 --> 10:09.100
How many times did I tell you
to keep up with me, son?

10:09.700 --> 10:11.500
I want you to stay with me, alright?

10:11.600 --> 10:14.251
You want me to hold your hand?
Do I need to hold you?

10:18.720 --> 10:21.287
Can you walk? Very good.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.900
I'm gonna count to 10. 10!

10:39.000 --> 10:41.840
If you aren't out here
by the time I hit 10,

10:41.940 --> 10:45.600
boy, you're gonna get a whooping so hard,
you won't know what the hell hit you.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.580
One, two,

10:49.265 --> 10:52.420
three, four,

10:52.520 --> 10:56.460
five, six...

10:56.560 --> 10:59.780
seven, eight,

10:59.880 --> 11:02.008
nine, ten.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.820
"Although it's quiet now, not a sound,

11:13.920 --> 11:16.600
"it's hard not to cry out.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.660
"The boy doesn't know why.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.820
"He doesn't know why,
but it's hard not to cry out.

11:22.545 --> 11:25.700
"It's so hard not to cry out."

11:35.360 --> 11:37.169
No!

12:03.000 --> 12:04.889
Daddy!

12:11.820 --> 12:13.749
Baby.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.300
Ooh, line it up.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.180
- Aw.
- Rats.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.420
You did it. That counts.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.809
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.962
- I did it!
- You did too.

12:35.240 --> 12:37.720
- And these rocks...
- Yep?

12:37.820 --> 12:40.700
...do you throw it at any animals?

12:41.384 --> 12:44.580
- No.
- What do you do with the rocks?

12:44.680 --> 12:47.540
- I hit them at the dumpster.
- At the dumpster?

12:52.800 --> 12:56.422
- You don't shoot it at any kids?
- No.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.024
You know what you should shoot at?

13:01.800 --> 13:04.601
You should shoot at your bad dreams.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.363
Mom? Mom?

13:52.640 --> 13:55.980
- I didn't know there was a pool here.
- Neither did I.

13:56.080 --> 13:59.081
It's great. It's great.

13:59.181 --> 14:02.605
- Did you unpack yet?
- Yeah.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.767
- No.
- No. No, I didn't.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.407
Dad'll be here tomorrow.
I think he'll like it here.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.340
- You're getting in?
- Yeah.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.480
I think I'm gonna practise my dive.

14:21.580 --> 14:24.180
I mean, I've been practising a lot,

14:24.280 --> 14:26.140
and...

14:26.240 --> 14:28.020
now I think I can get it,

14:28.620 --> 14:29.860
get it right.

14:30.796 --> 14:33.319
I know I can get it right this time.

14:33.419 --> 14:38.001
- I can get it really...
- Perfectly straight.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.300
"My mother, all through my childhood,

14:49.600 --> 14:53.540
"when I was saying something to her,
something important,

14:53.640 --> 14:56.860
"would move her lips as I was speaking

14:56.960 --> 14:59.060
"so that she seemed to be saying
under her breath

14:59.160 --> 15:02.700
"the very words I was saying
as I was saying them.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.040
"All she was really doing, of course,
was mouthing my words

15:06.140 --> 15:09.500
"a split second
after I said them myself.

15:09.900 --> 15:14.300
"But it wasn't until my own children were
learning to talk that I really understood how

15:14.400 --> 15:17.260
"and understood too
the edge of anxiety in it,

15:17.360 --> 15:20.660
"the wanting to bring you along
out of the silence,

15:20.760 --> 15:22.460
"the compulsion to lift you again

15:22.560 --> 15:26.521
"from those blank caverns
of namelessness we encase."

15:34.626 --> 15:38.060
- Mom? I think my watch stopped.
- Your watch stopped.

15:38.660 --> 15:41.340
Can you please stop repeating
what I'm saying?

15:41.440 --> 15:45.089
Okay. Alright, honey. Okay.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.320
"I breathe it still, that breeze.

16:23.638 --> 16:26.420
"I breathe it still, that breeze.

16:26.852 --> 16:30.780
"And not knowing how I know
for certain that it's that.

16:31.180 --> 16:33.860
"Although I know it is.

16:34.360 --> 16:39.440
"I don't know then that the place,
a mile from anywhere,

16:39.540 --> 16:43.020
"and day, brilliant, sultry, balmy,

16:43.520 --> 16:47.125
"is intensifying everything I feel."

16:48.340 --> 16:50.525
Whoa. Stop. No. Don't do that.

16:50.625 --> 16:51.940
Don't.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.246
Stop it.

17:06.599 --> 17:09.627
"Hm. I must be 12.

17:09.928 --> 17:12.480
"She a little older, 13, 14."

17:12.579 --> 17:16.227
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

17:19.463 --> 17:21.249
I don't know.

17:51.334 --> 17:52.569
It's so cold.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.029
- Don't look.
- What?

18:00.129 --> 18:01.603
Look away.

18:03.220 --> 18:04.884
You don't want to see this.

18:11.680 --> 18:15.063
Now that I've seen it,
it's gonna hurt worse.

18:22.287 --> 18:24.027
Squeeze.

19:03.059 --> 19:06.460
"I don't know then that the place,

19:06.560 --> 19:09.220
"a mile from anywhere,

19:09.320 --> 19:13.900
"and day, brilliant, sultry, balmy,

"I breathe it still, that breeze.

19:28.989 --> 19:31.783
"I breathe it still, that breeze.

19:32.780 --> 19:36.820
"And not knowing
how I know for certain that it's that.

19:36.920 --> 19:41.405
"Although it is, I know, exactly that."

20:51.156 --> 20:52.863
Sarah?

21:00.220 --> 21:01.929
Sarah?!

21:08.386 --> 21:10.029
Here.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.965
"I breathe it still, that breeze.

23:08.015 --> 23:11.580
"Stay still. Stay still. Here.

23:12.481 --> 23:13.980
"Stay still.

23:14.663 --> 23:16.180
"Stay still here."

23:34.852 --> 23:35.885
Irene!

23:45.411 --> 23:47.309
Can you drive?

23:47.880 --> 23:50.686
I have a couple of times with my dad.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.695
I don't know.

24:31.097 --> 24:32.959
You can.

24:33.548 --> 24:35.459
Play with your hair.

24:36.794 --> 24:38.924
Make 'em kiss you.

24:39.224 --> 24:41.148
I love you.

24:46.880 --> 24:51.961
"Stay. Still. Here.

24:53.140 --> 24:53.841
"Stay."

25:37.360 --> 25:40.677
"I knew something, surely.
I'd have had to.

25:40.777 --> 25:44.960
"What I really knew, of course,
I'll never know again

25:45.060 --> 25:49.700
"Beautiful memory, most precious
and most treacherous sister

25:49.800 --> 25:52.660
"What temples must we build for you?

25:52.760 --> 25:56.900
"And even then,
how belatedly you open to us

25:57.000 --> 26:02.128
"Even then, with what exuberance
you cross us."

26:05.040 --> 26:06.720
"It was cold,

26:06.820 --> 26:10.220
"but not enough to catch
or clear your breath.

26:10.520 --> 26:13.420
"Uncertain clouds, unemphatic light.

26:13.920 --> 26:17.820
"All that held now was that violated,
looted country,

26:17.920 --> 26:20.440
"the fraying fringes of the town,

26:20.540 --> 26:23.660
"those gutted hills, hills by rote,

26:23.760 --> 26:25.483
"hills by permission,

26:25.583 --> 26:28.860
"great, naked wastes of wrack and spill,

26:28.960 --> 26:31.060
"vivid and disconsolate,

26:31.960 --> 26:35.927
"like genitalia shaved
and disinfected for an operation."

26:41.280 --> 26:44.480
They're Japanese.
You get 40 miles to a gallon.

26:44.580 --> 26:46.140
- No way.
- Yeah way.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.660
- BS. They're lying.
- They're not lying.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.900
- They are lying.
- I'm thinking of buying one.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.800
You're a traitor, then.
Are you from Detroit or not?

26:53.900 --> 26:56.100
You get eight miles
a gallon in your Galaxy.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.780
That's right. That's how it starts.

26:57.880 --> 27:01.060
- What do you mean how it starts?
- That's how the un-American thing starts.

27:01.160 --> 27:03.540
You're unbelievable.
So, what, are you gonna buy a Gremlin?

27:03.640 --> 27:05.661
- A Gremlin's not a bad little car.
- It's a piece of junk.

27:05.761 --> 27:09.460
They're wide. You can put a submarine
sandwich all the way across sideways in it.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.080
Do you live in Detroit, yes or no?

27:11.180 --> 27:13.660
- Yeah, I do.
- Buy an American car.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.620
- God's sake.
- You're unbelievable.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.660
Have you been to Lafayette lately,
Coney Island?

27:17.760 --> 27:19.300
- What about it?
- It sucks.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.140
Why does it suck? I was there last week.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.860
It's cheaper. It's more expensive
and it's worse meat.

27:23.960 --> 27:26.100
How can it be worse meat?
It's already bad meat.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.100
I'm telling you, it's not the same.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.140
I had a horrible heartburn
when I was there.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.700
- And you don't normally?
- No.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.820
From their chilli cheese dog
with fries on the side?

27:34.920 --> 27:36.740
- Been at Woodward lately?
- No.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.360
- South of Davidson?
- No!

27:38.460 --> 27:39.740
- It's all screwed up.
- Really?

27:39.840 --> 27:42.140
They tore it up,
torn up into a million pieces.

27:42.240 --> 27:46.480
- Man. I got to go to Allen Park now.
- You ain't gonna get to Allen Park.

27:46.580 --> 27:47.920
You're gonna have to go
all the way around.

27:48.020 --> 27:51.020
- The gas is $1.20 a gallon.
- You got a customer.

27:51.120 --> 27:54.660
- What can I do for you, sir?
- Just this and a cup of coffee.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.040
- Okay. Cream, sugar?
- No.

27:57.140 --> 27:58.900
That'll be 65 cents.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.340
You guys are the only place
open around here.

28:01.440 --> 28:05.380
I'll be here until the end,
until God tells me to pull the switch.

28:06.079 --> 28:09.184
- I grew up around here.
- Where?

28:09.784 --> 28:11.640
- Birmingham.
- Birmingham. Hoity-toity.

28:11.740 --> 28:12.980
- Hoity-toity.
- Nice.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.860
- Where do you live now?
- Paris. France.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.740
- What the hell do you do there?
- France?

28:17.840 --> 28:20.320
- I'm a writer.
- They speak French there.

28:20.420 --> 28:23.700
- What do you write, French?
- Nah, just poetry.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.900
Poetry. I'm a poet.
But I didn't know it.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.420
But my feet show it.
They sure are long fellows.

28:30.744 --> 28:32.491
- Alright.
- Not bad.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.045
Mom!

29:26.040 --> 29:28.811
You alright? Come on.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.283
Come on in, fellas.

30:24.560 --> 30:28.489
Will you shut that door behind you?
Okay.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.180
So, here we are, men.
This is my humble abode.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.700
My stomping ground, home, you know?

30:39.800 --> 30:43.900
I'll tell you what, I'm really happy
that you guys decided to come along.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.325
- We're excited.
- Yeah.

30:46.625 --> 30:49.720
Do me a favour, man.
Usually we have no smoking in here.

30:49.820 --> 30:53.032
- Can you put that out for me?
- Sorry about that.

30:53.132 --> 30:54.726
Okay.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.340
You fellas make yourself at home. I'll be
right back in just one moment, alright?

31:00.440 --> 31:02.365
- Alright.
- Okay.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.282
Baby, you up?

31:22.520 --> 31:25.370
You been sleeping since I left?

31:33.880 --> 31:36.682
Would you like me
to make you some dinner?

31:37.525 --> 31:39.474
How many?

31:39.774 --> 31:41.102
Two.

31:42.280 --> 31:44.503
Put cheese in my eggs.

31:45.803 --> 31:48.580
Listen, baby, I brought you some water.

31:48.680 --> 31:51.323
It's right there. I'll be right back.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.084
You ready? Hey. Come here. You ready?

32:09.200 --> 32:11.050
$2.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.525
Sit down.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.960
- You ready?
- Yeah.

32:49.701 --> 32:52.289
You don't look like you're ready.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.020
Would you like something to eat?

33:23.120 --> 33:26.490
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm not really hungry.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.796
You're up.

35:38.880 --> 35:41.332
Get off me. Get off me.

35:41.832 --> 35:43.487
Fuck this, man.

35:54.860 --> 36:00.140
"A gas station, Route 22.
"I remember exactly... Route 22 curved.

36:00.540 --> 36:05.650

37:01.000 --> 37:02.979

37:03.668 --> 37:06.111
Come on, man. We gotta go.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.844
Charlie, come on.

37:28.920 --> 37:31.243
You're a fucking animal, Dan.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.284
Go home.

37:38.940 --> 37:40.530
Fucking...

37:56.220 --> 37:59.277

were there all along.

37:59.977 --> 38:02.900
"Complicity. Wonder.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.589
"How pure we were then.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.610
"Please."

39:34.707 --> 39:36.554
Unlock it!

39:37.084 --> 39:38.727
Lift it.

39:40.200 --> 39:43.820
Why did you lock it?
There. Come here, silly!

39:43.920 --> 39:46.160
Well, I want to go for a last time.

39:46.260 --> 39:50.080
No, it's just gonna be
one more time, okay? Gimme a kiss.

39:50.180 --> 39:53.220
- Can I count 'em one more time?
- Gimme a kiss first.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.069
- Love you.
- Love you.

39:57.540 --> 40:01.802
- Can I count to 20 this time?
- No, you cannot count to 20 this time.

40:07.200 --> 40:11.100
"The last party before I left,
I was at loose ends,

40:11.700 --> 40:14.500
"and although
I didn't like admitting it,

"chronically adrift and lonely."

maniacally mindless about it.

that intense, that lunatic.

- Hey.

- Come in.
- Thanks.

Mother has baked some streusel cake.

46:43.260 --> 46:45.328

Great.

so strenuous, aggressive.

"This is what she wanted somehow.
Only this. Yes. Only this."

49:54.938 --> 49:57.181
Is that a compliment?

49:59.380 --> 50:00.580
I think so.

50:00.680 --> 50:03.580
Baby? You think so?
Did you say you think so?

50:03.680 --> 50:06.884
- There are plenty of people...
- What?

50:06.984 --> 50:09.451
...that would die for that nose.

50:13.120 --> 50:14.761
I come in here to cheer you up...

of cartoon characters that...

50:17.960 --> 50:20.340
- ...have that nose.
- No. Stop. Stop.

50:20.440 --> 50:23.400
Stop while you're ahead in that one.

50:28.800 --> 50:31.520
- Your best smile.
- Yeah?

50:31.872 --> 50:33.922
That's cool.

- What?
- No. I'm just glad to see you.

Alright.

53:51.920 --> 53:54.179
How long are you gonna be here for?

53:54.279 --> 53:56.460
I don't know.

53:56.560 --> 53:58.855
Taking my time and...

53:58.955 --> 54:02.089
It's a great deal.
I just take care of the horses and...

54:07.760 --> 54:12.192
- Didn't know you liked animals.
- I do, I do. I've never ridden a horse.

54:12.957 --> 54:15.451

- Yeah. Fingers out.
- Don't take my fingers.

54:22.200 --> 54:26.300
Alright. If he gets... If he goes...
Keep your hands flat.

54:26.500 --> 54:29.080
- Feels funny.
- Don't give it to him till...

54:29.180 --> 54:32.980

kinda hobbling about.

54:43.480 --> 54:47.050
I keep him in the smaller pen
so he can't walk around so much.

55:15.863 --> 55:17.367
You okay?

55:41.160 --> 55:43.024
Come on, this way.

55:46.020 --> 55:48.320
So here it is.

55:48.420 --> 55:50.762
They said they can level it with stones.

55:50.862 --> 55:53.542
They just need three layers,

55:53.642 --> 55:56.251
then they can start
putting in the pillars.

55:56.640 --> 56:02.665
One'll go... out here,
one there and there and there.

56:02.960 --> 56:05.262
How long is that gonna take?

56:06.640 --> 56:09.022
They said about six months.

56:09.860 --> 56:11.450
Oh.

What?

56:17.600 --> 56:19.429
No, it's great.

and get some water.

57:57.412 --> 57:59.284

it wasn't an accident.

01:02:01.221 --> 01:02:03.198
- Yeah.
- How'd you like that?

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.060
Do you think we should shave
all of Daddy's hair off?

01:02:07.837 --> 01:02:09.460
No?

01:02:10.041 --> 01:02:12.620
"Surely we suspect now
we're being lied to."

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.039
...is still occurring inside the primary...

01:02:15.139 --> 01:02:18.180
"I remember the President
in his absurd protective booties

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.820
"looking absolutely unafraid...

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.620
"the fool."

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:27.500
"But in the meantime,
there are the roofers.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.060
"I never realised
what brutal work it is,

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.060
"how matter-of-factly
and harrowingly dangerous.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.940
"And there I am at my window, gawking."

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.696
...radiation from the facility
approximately 20 minutes ago...

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.300
...opt to stay indoors
as a precautionary measure,

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.780
you know, until they hear further...

01:02:48.692 --> 01:02:50.420
A lot of people are leaving
the Harrisburg area...

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.708
"However much we didn't want to,
however little we would do about it,

01:02:53.808 --> 01:02:55.580
"we'd understood...

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.340
"we were going to perish, all of us,

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.580
"if not now, then soon,

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.808
"if not soon, then some day."

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.780
"Be here now," she said.

01:03:48.216 --> 01:03:49.928
Just be here.

01:03:54.774 --> 01:03:56.048
Just be here.

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:23.060
"I think I know,
though I might rather not,

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.600
"why my roofers stay so clear to me

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.490
"and why the rest dims some."

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:34.240
...to leave the area
within a five-mile radius

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.740
of the Three Mile Island facility
until further notice.

01:04:38.247 --> 01:04:39.760
Let me stress once again

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:44.480
that the historic record of nuclear power
has been an excellent one.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:48.820
This is the first significant
nuclear accident

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.940
that we have experienced...

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.594
You okay?

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.569
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:20.500
It's okay.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.380
I don't know.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.168
Look, I'm... I'm sorry...
it's taken so long.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.343
I love you.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.050
I'll see you soon.

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:10.380
"No comfort here.
Nothing to say, to try to say.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.769
"Nothing for anyone.

01:08:18.154 --> 01:08:20.380
"Her silence,

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.680
"how to begin to speak of it?

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:26.920
"I think sometimes
I must have simply gaped.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:32.180
"There were harmonies in it,
progressions, colours, resolutions.

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:35.939
"It was a symphony, a tone poem.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.899
"I seemed to live in it.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.340
"It was always with me,

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:44.660
"a matrix, background sound,

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:48.009
"surf, wind.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:53.808
"Also, I'd found a girl
to be in love with.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.165
"All we wanted was to live together.

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.408
"So we did."

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.982
Thank you.
