00:27.853 --> 00:29.246
Who are you?

DISPATCHER:
911. What's your emergency?

00:57.970 --> 00:59.363
[whispers]:
Help me.

01:00.364 --> 01:01.626
You beat us here.

01:01.670 --> 01:02.845
Yeah, I was in the neighborhood
on another call.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.064
How you doing?

01:04.107 --> 01:06.109
A lot better than
this guy's doing.

01:06.153 --> 01:09.678
We got two entrance wounds,
no exit.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.854
ID says Charles Wright.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.116
28 years old.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.118
What was he doing in this area?
No coat...

01:15.162 --> 01:17.294
My guess is that he was
pushed out of a car.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.037
Maybe get some answers
from that.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.865
Anything interesting?

01:22.908 --> 01:24.171
Let's see.

01:24.214 --> 01:25.824
According to his last text,

01:25.868 --> 01:27.261
he was going to make
a gun buy at 2:00.

01:27.304 --> 01:30.133
621 118th Street.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.179
We've got just enough time
to get there.

01:32.222 --> 01:35.051
All right, you get the warrant,
I'll put the pedal to the metal.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.711
That look like two guys
headed to a gun buy?

01:42.754 --> 01:44.887
He's got that gun out
in broad daylight.

01:44.930 --> 01:47.150
I see it.We waiting for backup?

01:47.194 --> 01:49.152
No, we're not. Let's go.

Hey, Eddie.

Heard you guys caught this one.

02:33.805 --> 02:35.242
Hope you skipped lunch.

02:35.285 --> 02:37.113
That bad?It's a massacre.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.159
Mom's in the kitchen, Dad.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.987
The son,

02:42.031 --> 02:44.120
Robert Watkins.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.948
He left a
message for us.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.210
"Max"?

02:47.254 --> 02:49.125
Any idea
who Max is?

02:49.169 --> 02:52.041
The daughter Sarah, 18,
she's the only survivor.

02:52.084 --> 02:54.261
She was too traumatized
to answer questions.

ABETEMARCO:
No kidding.
Oh, Erin,

02:56.176 --> 02:58.265
this is Felix Evans,
he's with ATF.

Erin Reagan.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.311
Another Reagan? Any relation?

03:01.355 --> 03:02.878
Erin's my sister-in-law.

03:02.921 --> 03:03.966
They're the law
enforcement mafia,

03:04.009 --> 03:06.403
so you better watch
your Ps and Qs.

03:06.447 --> 03:07.926
I'm Investigator
Anthony Abetemarco

03:07.970 --> 03:09.972
from the D.A.'s office.

03:10.015 --> 03:11.800
So why is ATF involved?

03:11.843 --> 03:13.236
We're investigating
a gunrunning operation

03:13.280 --> 03:14.498
down in Georgia
that had similar murders.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.805
And you think they're connected?

03:16.848 --> 03:18.241
Pretty certain it's
the same shooter.

03:18.285 --> 03:19.373
Based on what?

03:19.416 --> 03:21.201
Family massacred
in the same manner,

03:21.244 --> 03:22.854
and my partner had a lead

03:22.898 --> 03:25.161
on this young man
who was killed here,

03:25.205 --> 03:26.554
believed to be part
of their operation,

03:26.597 --> 03:28.164
and that's just too
much of a coincidence.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.253
You got anyone named Max
on your radar?

03:30.297 --> 03:31.298
I do now.

03:31.341 --> 03:32.951
And if the current
pattern holds,

03:32.995 --> 03:35.519
this won't be the last time
we hear from him.

03:39.523 --> 03:43.832
Three precincts in particular
have come to our attention.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.095
The 6-5, 8-5 and 1-16
have all had huge spikes

03:46.138 --> 03:47.488
in assaults and robberies.

03:47.531 --> 03:48.663
And the Posthas
already called twice,

03:48.706 --> 03:50.186
asking for a comment.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.057
The comment is no comment.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.117
I'm in a stash house
in Manhattan working a homicide

04:08.160 --> 04:10.554
when I recognize
one of three perps.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.643
Joe Hill.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.561
He's working undercover?

04:17.605 --> 04:19.084
[sighs]

04:19.128 --> 04:22.958
Yes. He's on loan to ATF.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.742
And you knew about this
way back,

04:24.786 --> 04:26.266
when he didn't show up
for family dinner?

04:26.309 --> 04:30.922
No, but he reached out
soon after.

04:30.966 --> 04:35.013
And Danny, I sure as hell
had no idea he was in Manhattan.

04:35.057 --> 04:38.843
Okay. Anyone else know
he's working undercover?

04:38.887 --> 04:42.586
Jamie's been working
as his handler.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.284
Jamie.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.851
Nothing personal.Oh.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.114
But I should talk to Jamie about
the fact that my partner or I

04:49.158 --> 04:51.900
could have killed my nephew,
your grandson,

04:51.943 --> 04:53.293

Man, it is good
to hear your voice.

said you're in the city.

Guessing he told you
about our run-in with Danny?

05:21.321 --> 05:22.844
Yeah.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.802
Everyone's been on edge since.

You want to call this off?

05:26.238 --> 05:27.718
Not yet.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.807
We just heard from the boss.
He wants to meet with us.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.157
I don't know,

I might have been made.

Well, where's the meeting?

06:10.935 --> 06:12.981

the 35 guns confiscated?

06:13.024 --> 06:14.722
That was kicks and giggles, too?

06:14.765 --> 06:17.377
Yeah, I don't know where
they're from or who owns them.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.726
You think this is funny?

06:18.769 --> 06:20.510
Think it's funny that
you think I'm stupid enough

06:20.554 --> 06:22.904
to cooperate with cops.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.427
So, you're too smart
to cooperate with cops,

06:24.471 --> 06:27.909
but too dumb to realize
the 35 guns you had

06:27.952 --> 06:30.912
are gonna land you
15 to 20 in prison?

06:30.955 --> 06:32.740
So maybe you want to tell us
about the other guys

06:32.783 --> 06:34.394
and where the guns are headed.

06:34.437 --> 06:36.265
And if you do,
maybe we'll talk to the D.A.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.441
about getting you some leniency.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.574
What kind of leniency?The kind of leniency

06:40.617 --> 06:42.445
that will ensure
you're not on Social Security

06:42.489 --> 06:44.316
when you walk out of prison.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.318
Okay.

But I talk
to the D.A.'s office. Not you.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.936
Mm-hmm. Good.

06:54.979 --> 06:56.764
Do you know someone named Max

06:56.807 --> 06:58.592
that may have a connection
to your family?

06:58.635 --> 07:00.942
Robbie worked
for a guy named Max.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.291
Doing what?

07:02.334 --> 07:04.467
Robbie was kind of vague
about it.

07:04.511 --> 07:07.688
But I'm pretty sure
Max was into something bad.

07:07.731 --> 07:08.950
What makes you say that?

07:08.993 --> 07:11.474
Because Robbie told me

07:11.518 --> 07:14.651
he wanted to get away from him
because he was trouble.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.917
I wish I didn't hide.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.658
[crying softly]

07:21.702 --> 07:23.660
He would've killed you, too.

Rachel Weber, ATF.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.760
Let's have her.

07:38.545 --> 07:41.461
I know what you're gonna say,
and I didn't know Detective Hill

07:41.504 --> 07:43.637
had come into the city.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.508
You sat in this office

07:45.552 --> 07:48.337
and promised me
that he would not be working

07:48.380 --> 07:50.078
within the confines
of the five boroughs.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.384
Commissioner, I was
as surprised as you

07:52.428 --> 07:53.995
when I was notified he was
making a sale in New York City.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.997
So that's your excuse?
You don't know?

07:56.040 --> 07:57.651
He decided to come
to the city on his own,

07:57.694 --> 07:58.869
without prior consent.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.002
Now, that seems
a little reckless to me,

08:01.045 --> 08:02.612
but it comes with the territory.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.527
What's that supposed to mean?

08:04.571 --> 08:06.573
There's a reason he made
detective at 25.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.444
It wasn't for standing
in the shadows.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.839
He could've been shot today,
by his own people.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.536
It's an undercover operation.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.103
We don't know where he's going
to be minute to minute.

08:15.146 --> 08:18.410
I understand that. But...

08:19.803 --> 08:23.546
What, do you micromanage every
undercover in your department,

08:23.590 --> 08:26.549
or is there something special
about Detective Hill?

08:28.856 --> 08:30.771
Nothing is more important to me

08:30.814 --> 08:33.034
than the safety
of my own people.

08:33.077 --> 08:35.515
Me, too, so you're gonna
have to trust me.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.691
Well, I don't trust anyone,
and at this moment,

08:37.734 --> 08:39.388
least of all you.

08:39.431 --> 08:43.000
I appreciate your concerns,
but this is an ATF operation.

08:43.044 --> 08:47.091
With an NYPD detective
in a lynchpin position.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.398
Do you or do you not

08:49.441 --> 08:51.705
have eyes or ears on him
at this moment?

08:51.748 --> 08:53.837
I can't share sensitive
information with you.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.099
It's on a need-to-know basis.

08:55.143 --> 08:56.579
Well, I need to know.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.625
Commissioner,
you need to stay out.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.426
Uh-huh.
20 of the guns

09:17.469 --> 09:20.560
go back to a Dayton's Gun
Shop on the Georgia border

09:20.603 --> 09:23.084
and 15 of them are
from various gun shows.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.086
What, so they buy them
legally in Georgia,

09:25.129 --> 09:27.001
then come up here
and sell them illegally?

09:27.044 --> 09:28.785
For five times as much.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.134
Yeah. Got it.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.094
How's it going?

09:33.137 --> 09:36.619
Fine. We're just working.I can see that.

09:36.663 --> 09:39.753
I was hoping to have a word
with you privately.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.798
Yeah, I'll go take a
walk. I'll be back.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.583
Okay.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.674
What can I do for you?

09:47.717 --> 09:49.458
Look, I know you're upset
about this whole thing,

09:49.501 --> 09:51.068
how it went down.You mean,

09:51.112 --> 09:53.941
how you and Dad pretended that
Joe walked out on the family

09:53.984 --> 09:56.552
but you were working together
with him the whole time. That?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.119
I'm worried about him.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.947
Why?Because he called me

09:59.990 --> 10:02.036
and told me he's under suspicion
because of your takedown.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.168
[laughs]:
Oh, 'cause of my takedown?

10:04.212 --> 10:05.779
My takedown never
would've happened

10:05.822 --> 10:07.781
if you'd have told me
what was going on.
Yeah...

10:07.824 --> 10:09.826
So I'm supposed to
feel bad about this?No, not at all.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.567
I'm just wondering
how the whole thing went down.

was on his way to a gun buy.

would be the seller.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.597
They're not mine.They were in
your possession,

10:41.641 --> 10:43.599
and 12 of those weapons

10:43.643 --> 10:45.035
were purchased in your name.

10:45.079 --> 10:46.602
Purchased legally.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.952
In Georgia for personal use.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.171
Not for resale
in New York City.

10:50.214 --> 10:51.694
But judging
from the number

10:51.738 --> 10:53.653
of weapons you've purchased
over the past two years,

10:53.696 --> 10:55.263
I think you already know this.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.873
So?

10:56.917 --> 10:58.701
DANNY:
So...

10:58.745 --> 11:01.269
you tell us who killed
Charles Wright,

11:01.312 --> 11:03.271
and she'll talk to you
about a deal.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.839
Just like you requested.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.537
What's the deal?

11:08.580 --> 11:10.887
Well, that depends on what
kind of information you have.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.802
But if it's
significant, I can

11:12.846 --> 11:14.586
knock those charges down
to criminal possession

11:14.630 --> 11:15.849
in the second degree.

11:15.892 --> 11:18.242
You'll be facing
three and a half to 15.

11:18.286 --> 11:21.202
[exhales]
I'm not for sure who killed him.

11:21.245 --> 11:22.725
But I think I know why.

11:22.769 --> 11:23.900
Why?

11:23.944 --> 11:25.206
He's one of our gunrunners.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.164
You know, he brings the guns up.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.905
But boss found out
he was skimming.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.211
Now who's the boss?

11:30.254 --> 11:31.734
Well, that's above
my pay grade.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.736
But I know
who carries out the hits.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.957
Max Fagan.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.744
Do you know a Robert Watkins?

11:41.788 --> 11:44.181
I heard Max done
took care of him, too.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.883
[sighs]

11:56.106 --> 11:59.588
What's your lucky number?

11:59.631 --> 12:01.633
Thirty-three.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.766
Larry Bird.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.768
What are you doing?

12:05.812 --> 12:08.031
I always play
the lottery.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.642
Especially when I'm nervous.

12:10.686 --> 12:12.644
What, you're nervous
about the boss?

12:12.688 --> 12:13.950
He sounded pissed.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.691
He say anything?

12:15.735 --> 12:16.910
[door opens]

12:16.953 --> 12:18.781
You better have
some good answers

12:18.825 --> 12:20.914
to how the cops
get my hardware.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.611
DICKSON: Swear to God,
I don't know.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.091
Maybe your friend knows.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.094
What, you think
we tipped off the cops?

12:27.137 --> 12:28.617
You tell me.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.793
I swear to God, we didn't
tip off anybody, Kenny.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.664
Give me your phone.

12:33.927 --> 12:34.928
Boss...

12:34.971 --> 12:36.930
Give me your damn phone.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.074
Who's Jimmy Reilly?

12:51.118 --> 12:52.162
My brother.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.208
He's your brother, huh?Yeah.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.906
What, is he a lawyer?
He's a cop?

12:56.950 --> 12:58.821
Neither, no.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.954
But he's the first guy
you call 15 minutes

13:00.997 --> 13:02.782
after you get raided
by the cops?

13:02.825 --> 13:04.131
Yeah. So?

13:09.136 --> 13:10.354
[line ringing]

13:11.399 --> 13:13.401
[phone ringing]

13:18.841 --> 13:20.147
Hello?

13:20.190 --> 13:22.236
Who's this?

13:22.279 --> 13:23.977
Who are you?

13:24.020 --> 13:26.109
You don't need to know who I am.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.895
What do you want?

13:28.938 --> 13:30.331
How do you know Joe Reilly?

13:31.462 --> 13:33.290
I'm his brother.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.861
Hey, hey, whoa! Whoa!

13:38.905 --> 13:40.254
Come on, man, he's clean.His brother, huh?

13:40.297 --> 13:42.386
What kind of car
do you drive,

13:42.430 --> 13:45.302
Joe Reilly's brother?

13:45.346 --> 13:46.782
Wha-- Who is this?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.088
You don't answer
right now,

13:48.131 --> 13:49.916
I'll put a bullet in his brain.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.700
Please, Kenny, I can vouch!

13:51.743 --> 13:53.745
I drive a '71 Chevelle.

13:56.357 --> 13:59.751
What kind of car
does your brother drive?

14:02.015 --> 14:04.278
A '71 Chevelle.

14:09.283 --> 14:10.327
Who is this?

14:10.371 --> 14:12.068
What the hell is this about?

14:12.112 --> 14:14.418
[line clicks]

14:18.466 --> 14:19.815
See?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.121
You see, he's clean.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.906
He's clean.
There's no problem.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.473
I'm now down two guys.
We have a big shipment

14:25.516 --> 14:26.778
coming in Wednesday.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.911
We'll handle it.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.915
I find out one of
you tipped the cops,

14:32.959 --> 14:35.222
you'll end up on the
front page of the paper,

14:35.265 --> 14:37.311
like that Watkins family.

14:38.312 --> 14:39.487
You don't have
to worry about us.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.489
Where is the shipment coming in?

14:41.532 --> 14:43.186
You don't need to know that yet.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.845
But there's someone
I want you to work with.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.240
Guys...

14:53.283 --> 14:55.982
this is Max.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.811
You're gonna be working
with him from now on.

15:11.171 --> 15:14.087
Here we go, Max Fagan,
greatest hits.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.916
Criminal possession
of a weapon, assault.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.962
He was even acquitted
of murder after trial.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.790
Great, let's collar him.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.400
We don't have enough.

15:23.444 --> 15:25.011
What are you talking about?
You just said he killed

15:25.054 --> 15:27.317
an entire family
and he killed our vic.

15:27.361 --> 15:29.450
We don't have
probable cause for arrest.

15:29.493 --> 15:30.973
We got a witness
who just told us--

15:31.017 --> 15:33.193
He said he heard it
was Max-- hearsay.

15:33.236 --> 15:34.542
Oh, my...

15:34.585 --> 15:36.805
This guy's gotten off
for murder once before.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.502
These charges got to stick.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.809
Okay, genius, what'd you
find at the crime scene?

15:40.852 --> 15:43.290
Half a dozen shell casings,
that's about it.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.813
DANNY:
Yeah, not much. Look.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.293
It's obvious
these cases are connected.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.903
We gotta get this guy
off the street

15:47.947 --> 15:49.122
before he kills someone else.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.428
Great, you guys can
work it together.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.303
I talked to our guys
working with ATF.

15:56.346 --> 15:59.393
Word is that Weber doesn't
trust her own shadow.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.917
I kind of got that
from our meeting.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.137
But, by all accounts,
she's good at her job,

16:04.180 --> 16:05.486
and well respected.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.836
Well, my concern

16:07.879 --> 16:10.317
is keeping my grandson alive.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.145
His boss called me,
checking up on him.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.495
So they're definitely
sniffing around.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.845
You think he's been made?

16:16.888 --> 16:18.499
I think I put him at ease.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.936
But... they're raised up.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.504
Maybe we need to pull him out.

16:23.547 --> 16:24.418
Problem is
that I haven't been able

16:24.461 --> 16:25.985
to reach him since yesterday.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.335
What about the GPS on his car?

16:28.378 --> 16:31.512
It stopped transmitting shortly
after Danny ran into him.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.864
Could be he's just laying low.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.909
[sighs]

16:37.953 --> 16:39.911
Or he's in trouble.

16:40.912 --> 16:43.219
We noticed you got a security
camera in the building.

16:44.220 --> 16:45.526
Yeah?

16:45.569 --> 16:47.528
We need to see the footage
from yesterday morning.

16:47.571 --> 16:48.877
It's on a hard drive.

16:48.920 --> 16:49.921
We'll wait.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.447
Max Fagan live
in this building?

16:53.490 --> 16:56.058
Yeah, he's a model tenant.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.408
You see him at all
yesterday morning?

16:58.452 --> 17:00.454
SAM:
Yeah, saw him walking his dog.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.195
DANNY:
What time was that?[dog barks]

17:02.238 --> 17:05.198
MAX:
Hey, Sam?

17:05.241 --> 17:07.330
Everything all right?

17:07.374 --> 17:08.897
Yeah, hey, these detectives

17:08.940 --> 17:10.290
are asking me about you.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.465
Well, here I am.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.467
So now you can ask me directly.

17:13.510 --> 17:16.078
DANNY: Detective Reagan,
Detective Abetemarco.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.601
We're investigating, uh,

17:17.645 --> 17:19.647
some robberies

17:19.690 --> 17:21.083
in the area.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.345
ABETEMARCO: Where were
you yesterday morning

17:22.389 --> 17:24.608
between the hours
of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.?

17:24.652 --> 17:26.393
In my apartment.

17:26.436 --> 17:29.396
Might've stepped out
to walk my dog.

17:29.439 --> 17:30.571
Can anyone verify that?

17:30.614 --> 17:32.442
CHARLOTTE:
I can verify.
And who are you?

17:32.486 --> 17:34.575
I'm his girlfriend. Charlotte.

17:36.272 --> 17:37.317
Why? Am I a suspect?

17:37.360 --> 17:38.405
No, we were
just wondering

17:38.448 --> 17:40.146
if you saw
anything unusual.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.017
Nope.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.019
Sorry, guys,
the memory card is full.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.152
I don't have any footage
from yesterday.

17:47.153 --> 17:50.025
That's too bad, but I'll be
sure to keep my eye open

17:50.069 --> 17:52.506
for anything suspicious.
Come on.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.290
You do that.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.426
[rapid scratching]

17:59.469 --> 18:02.298
I think the boss was
thinking one of us is a cop.

18:02.342 --> 18:05.171
Yeah, that's
crazy, right?

18:05.214 --> 18:07.216
He's paranoid, but, still,
he's not the kind of guy

18:07.260 --> 18:08.609
you want questioning
your loyalty.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.741
I've seen what he does
to people.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.441
Damn!

18:14.484 --> 18:16.443
Try this.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.488
It's my lucky medal.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.231
Saint Jude?

18:22.275 --> 18:23.667
Yep.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.105
Patron saint
of hopeless cases.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.629
It was my dad's.

18:28.672 --> 18:30.457
"JR"? That's his initials?

18:30.500 --> 18:32.589
Yeah, Joe Reilly.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.548
I was named after him.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.639
So this guy Max...

18:38.682 --> 18:40.467
What do you know
about him?

18:40.510 --> 18:42.164
He's Cook's muscle.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.645
Anybody that crosses Cook,
Max takes them out.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.560
Hmm.
Never to be see again.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.997
So how do you know he's not
planning something for us, then,

18:49.040 --> 18:50.433
having us work with him?

18:50.477 --> 18:52.522
[laughs]
It worked.

18:52.566 --> 18:55.134
I won four bucks--
I can buy two more of these.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.613
Why do you play these?

18:56.657 --> 18:58.354
If I hit it rich,
I can quit.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.400
Okay, and then what?

19:00.443 --> 19:03.054
Open a crepe place.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.361
Crepes?Yeah, when I was little,
my nana used to take me

19:05.405 --> 19:07.363
to Coney Island.
There was a little

19:07.407 --> 19:09.322
hole in the wall spot there,
sold crepes.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.324
Every day there was
a line around the corner.

19:11.367 --> 19:14.196
So how'd you end up
running guns, then?

19:14.240 --> 19:16.155
My dad got me into it.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.593
I got into this
'cause of my dad, too.

19:22.639 --> 19:25.381
Well, maybe after this
next buy, I can walk away.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.342
You might want to do it
while you still can, man.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.257
You never know
what might happen.

19:32.606 --> 19:35.217
That's why I don't
trust anybody.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.568
Except you.

19:48.839 --> 19:52.234
Max Fagan's girlfriend,
Charlotte, confirms his alibi.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.367
ABETEMARCO:
We're checking their phones
to see if it gives us

19:54.410 --> 19:56.238
their location
at the time of the murders.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.066
[knocking]

19:58.109 --> 19:59.502
Hi.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.156
Hope I'm not interrupting.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.767
Special Agent Evans, this is
Detective Reagan, my brother.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.769
Also working the case.I just met

20:05.813 --> 20:07.728
your sister-in-law yesterday.
How many of you are there?

20:07.771 --> 20:09.164
A whole bunch of us.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.600
Agent Evans is ATF.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.689
Mm-hmm, so you're
following the gun?

20:12.733 --> 20:14.778
And the shooter.
As I'm sure Erin

20:14.822 --> 20:16.258
already told you,
we think

20:16.302 --> 20:17.433
Max is responsible for at least

20:17.477 --> 20:18.739
five murders down in Georgia.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.567
Mm, too bad you're not good
at catching him.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.395
Well, I guess you're not,
either.

20:22.438 --> 20:25.224
I would've caught him already,
but my hands are tied.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.442
Can we stay focused, please?Mm-hmm.

20:26.486 --> 20:27.574
How can I help you?

20:27.617 --> 20:29.097
Ballistics compared
the bullets

20:29.140 --> 20:30.272
from our homicides

20:30.316 --> 20:31.752
to the Watkins
family murders.

20:31.795 --> 20:34.145
It's a match.

20:34.189 --> 20:35.582
So ballistics tie
the murders together,

20:35.625 --> 20:38.324
but don't tie it to Max Fagan.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.108
DANNY: Okay, but there's
got to be something

20:40.151 --> 20:42.589
at the Watkins family
crime scene that connects

20:42.632 --> 20:44.417
Max Fagan.
Hairs were found.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.853
Which turned out
not to be human.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.333
DANNY:
Great.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.160
And the family didn't
have any pets.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.163
The familydidn't have any pets.

20:53.817 --> 20:56.429
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

20:56.472 --> 20:57.778
Max has a dog.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.301
DANNY:
Yes, he does.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.912
Okay, so you know
what you have to do.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.352
I got nothing.

21:06.395 --> 21:07.570
Why'd you have to
bring up dog hairs

21:07.614 --> 21:09.137
at the crime scene anyway?

21:09.180 --> 21:11.270
This is brutal.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.184
You're telling me.

21:13.228 --> 21:14.795
There's only one left.

21:14.838 --> 21:15.883
Well, I'm not digging in it.

21:15.926 --> 21:16.884
Well, I'm not either.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.581
Fine, we'll flip for it.

21:18.625 --> 21:19.626
That's fine.

21:20.801 --> 21:23.456
Call it.
Tails.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.458
Heads.
Son of a bitch!

21:25.501 --> 21:26.633
[chuckles]

21:26.676 --> 21:29.157
[groans]Knock yourself out.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.811
Why is it every time
I have a case with you

21:30.854 --> 21:32.334
I'm sifting through garbage?

21:32.378 --> 21:33.814
Well, you got a nose
for garbage.

21:33.857 --> 21:36.164
Every bet I make
with you I lose.

21:36.207 --> 21:39.559
Well, that's because I have
a two-headed coin.

21:39.602 --> 21:40.734
You bastard.

21:40.777 --> 21:43.389
[laughs]:
Keep digging.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.870
Ah.

21:48.742 --> 21:50.657
Got it.

21:50.700 --> 21:51.701
There you go.

21:51.745 --> 21:54.530
That wasn't so bad, was it?

22:01.885 --> 22:05.411
HENRY:
Pass the potatoes, please.

22:05.454 --> 22:06.499
SEAN:
Sure thing, Pops.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.501
It's really good, Erin.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.851
I like these
roasted potatoes.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.200
Thank you.

22:12.243 --> 22:13.201
SEAN: Yeah, well,
there's gonna be

22:13.244 --> 22:14.681
a lot of leftovers,
especially

22:14.724 --> 22:17.684
because Grandpa, Dad and
Uncle Jamie are barely eating.

22:17.727 --> 22:19.555
And barely talking.

22:19.599 --> 22:20.861
JANKO:
I don't know what's worse,

22:20.904 --> 22:23.559
you guys arguing
or not saying a word.

22:26.475 --> 22:27.650
Anyone care to fill us in?

22:27.694 --> 22:28.912
DANNY:
Don't ask me.

22:28.956 --> 22:31.480
Talk to Dad or Jamie.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.264
They're the ones keeping
all the secrets.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.488
Okay, what's going on?

22:39.532 --> 22:41.795
DANNY:You're not gonna get
nothing out of them.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.536
I'll just say that
gun trafficking

22:43.579 --> 22:45.712
operation we're working--

22:45.755 --> 22:46.713
you know, the one with the
family that was massacred?

22:46.756 --> 22:48.236
Mm-hmm.Yeah.

22:48.279 --> 22:51.282
There's been a man on
the inside the whole time.

22:51.326 --> 22:53.589
ERIN:
Great.DANNY: Yeah, great.

22:53.633 --> 22:54.721
Except you won't
think it's great

22:54.764 --> 22:55.939
when you find out
who it is.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.987
You're so anxious to share.

23:00.030 --> 23:01.945
Just tell 'em.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.731
Fine. Since you won't, I will.

23:04.774 --> 23:07.255
You guys know the Reagan
that we never even knew

23:07.298 --> 23:08.735
existed, who showed up

23:08.778 --> 23:10.911
and then vanished without
a trace or an explanation?

23:10.954 --> 23:12.434
Well, now we know why.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.436
Joe Hill is the man
on the inside.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.003
What?

23:17.831 --> 23:19.006
Joe's working undercover?

23:19.049 --> 23:20.747
Don't ask me.
Ask your husband.

23:20.790 --> 23:22.575
He's known the whole time.

23:22.618 --> 23:23.706
Is this true?

23:23.750 --> 23:25.404
Yes.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.624
Just like his dad.

23:28.668 --> 23:31.279
I don't need you
to remind me, Sean.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.367
How long?

23:32.411 --> 23:33.368
Six months.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.587
SEAN:
So right around the time

23:34.630 --> 23:37.024
you told us that he was
taking time off.

23:38.765 --> 23:39.940
You lied to us.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.332
Nobody lied.

23:42.812 --> 23:45.772
Joe reached out to me
about a week after that.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.469
ATF had contacted him.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.340
He wanted to work undercover.
That's it.

23:49.384 --> 23:51.734
Great, so nothing
too dangerous.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.564
How long have you known?

23:55.608 --> 23:56.783
Since the beginning.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.306
You didn't
tell anyone?

23:58.349 --> 23:59.394
You couldn't tell me?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.352
He shouldn't,
so he couldn't.

24:01.396 --> 24:02.963
Come on, Eddie,
you're a cop.

24:03.006 --> 24:05.966
You've gotta know
if he could share that weight

24:06.009 --> 24:08.751
he's carrying on his shoulders,
he would.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.797
DANNY:
Okay, how about the weight
we would have felt

24:10.840 --> 24:13.452
if Joe would have died
the same way his father did?

24:13.495 --> 24:16.498
Killed by a cop while he
was working undercover.

24:16.542 --> 24:17.978
And what if I was the cop?

24:18.021 --> 24:19.066
I could have been.

24:19.109 --> 24:20.459
If we knew he was working
in the city,

24:20.502 --> 24:21.503
we would have told you.

24:21.547 --> 24:22.548
Yeah, well, you didn't.

24:22.591 --> 24:23.810
If you were his handler, Danny,

24:23.853 --> 24:25.768
you would have done
the exact same thing.

24:25.812 --> 24:27.509
How could you let him do this?

24:27.553 --> 24:28.771
Joe asked to do it.

24:28.815 --> 24:31.513
So what?He's a grown man.
It's his choice.

24:34.385 --> 24:37.824
Look, it's as simple
as it is complicated.

24:37.867 --> 24:41.523
It is my job to keep
my people safe.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.526
And none of you had
a need to know.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.920
Excuse me.

25:02.065 --> 25:04.067
♪

25:14.600 --> 25:17.428
So how's that weight
on your shoulders?

25:20.910 --> 25:24.523
To be honest, it's, uh...

25:24.566 --> 25:26.437
getting heavier.

25:29.789 --> 25:32.400
I remember.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.533
It freights on you
until you have no choice

25:34.576 --> 25:37.405
but to come out from under it.

25:41.888 --> 25:44.891
You made the right decision,
Francis.

25:46.588 --> 25:47.981
He's a good cop.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.855
Like his father.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.770
Yeah.

25:58.426 --> 26:01.647
Rest of the family,
they'll come around.

26:01.690 --> 26:04.867
They're just scared for him,
that's all.

26:10.438 --> 26:12.005
They're not the only ones.

26:14.747 --> 26:17.445
[sighs]

26:17.488 --> 26:19.490
You've got to stop
doing this, Jamie.

26:19.534 --> 26:21.841
What?Retreating into yourself.

26:21.884 --> 26:22.929
That's not what I'm doing.

26:22.972 --> 26:24.670
That's what
you're all doing.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.410
Did it sound like anyone
at that family dinner today

26:26.454 --> 26:27.455
was retreating?

26:27.498 --> 26:28.978
Listen, I love you guys,
I do.

26:29.022 --> 26:32.721
But whenever anything hits
a little too close to home,

26:32.765 --> 26:34.897
you all just find some way
to bottle it up.

26:34.941 --> 26:37.378
[exhales] Thank you, Dr. Phil.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.727
I'm being serious, Jamie.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.903
This happened to me

26:40.947 --> 26:42.862
and my family
when my dad cheated.

26:42.905 --> 26:45.299
We never talked
about any of it.

26:45.342 --> 26:47.649
Those wounds, they don't...
they don't go anywhere.

26:47.693 --> 26:48.998
They just fester.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.870
And that's why
we could not forgive him.

26:52.611 --> 26:56.615
I would hate to see that
happen to you.

26:59.356 --> 27:00.923
The dog hairs
from both crime scenes

27:00.967 --> 27:03.447
match Max's dog.

27:03.491 --> 27:05.493
So, unless the dog is
the murderer,

27:05.536 --> 27:07.800
that puts Max at both scenes.

27:07.843 --> 27:10.498
So can we arrest this guy now?

27:10.541 --> 27:12.935
It's still circumstantial.

27:12.979 --> 27:13.980
DANNY:
Oh, my God.

27:14.023 --> 27:15.938
You're kidding me.

27:15.982 --> 27:17.592
ERIN: Look, it ties
the murders together,

27:17.636 --> 27:20.900
but it doesn't tie Max Fagan
to either directly.

27:20.943 --> 27:23.467
Let me arrest him
on anything.

27:23.511 --> 27:25.295
It'll buy us some time

27:25.339 --> 27:26.645
that we need.

27:28.342 --> 27:31.519
We can't arrest this guy
for nothing.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.001
Please.

27:37.351 --> 27:38.831
Do it.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.313
[sighs]

27:43.357 --> 27:44.706
[door opens]

27:44.750 --> 27:47.317
She's back, and she's pissed.

27:47.361 --> 27:48.971
Want to let her cool off?

27:49.015 --> 27:51.887
Nah.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.983
You want to tell me
what's going on?

28:04.987 --> 28:06.859
I'm not sure I know
what you mean.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.512
Did you order
Detective Hill

28:08.556 --> 28:10.427
to only communicate
with Sergeant Reagan?

28:10.471 --> 28:12.691
It is too dangerous
for him to have

28:12.734 --> 28:13.953
multiple points of contact.

28:13.996 --> 28:16.042
That is not your call.

28:16.085 --> 28:18.000
It's his, and he made it.

28:18.044 --> 28:20.524
You are interfering
in a federal investigation.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.744
[scoffs]: We want to shut down
this organization

28:22.788 --> 28:25.399
as much as you do,
but not at the expense

28:25.442 --> 28:26.617
of my detective.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.532
Your detective has been
under my command

28:28.576 --> 28:30.839
for the last six months
without incident.

28:30.883 --> 28:33.450
I don't mind working together
with you, Commissioner,

28:33.494 --> 28:35.365
but you think now
you're gonna tell me

28:35.409 --> 28:36.802
how to run my operation?

28:36.845 --> 28:40.414
Only in how it relates
to Detective Hill.

28:47.595 --> 28:50.729
If something happens to him,
it's gonna be on you.

I don't know.

[exhales]

29:14.970 --> 29:18.539
Evans, you take the back.
Abetemarco, you take mine.

Detectives.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.110
How can I help you?DANNY: You can't.

29:24.153 --> 29:25.546
We're going to see Max.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.548
Actually, he left here
about an hour ago.

29:27.591 --> 29:28.810
Had a couple of suitcases
with him.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.594
Where the hell'd he go?Don't know.

29:30.638 --> 29:32.553
It seemed like he was
in a hurry.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.470
Let's go.

29:36.513 --> 29:38.124
[tire wrench whirring]

29:40.474 --> 29:42.824
I'm telling you, man,
this thing has a bad aura.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.086
Come on.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.001
It's only my second flat.

29:46.045 --> 29:48.569
Plus the time you had
engine trouble.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.745
Buy you some sage or something.[laughs]

29:50.789 --> 29:52.007
Yeah, you do that.

29:52.051 --> 29:53.443
Buy me some sage.

29:53.487 --> 29:56.055
Almost done.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.883
Thanks.

29:57.926 --> 29:59.928
You mind taking a look
under the hood while we're here,

29:59.972 --> 30:02.452
just to make sure
everything's okay?Sure thing.

30:02.496 --> 30:04.933
What do you think of
the power train on this guy?

30:04.977 --> 30:06.456
[hood unlatches]

30:06.500 --> 30:08.023
3.6 V6 Pentastar.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.895
You're thinking of the 300S.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.853
The Chrysler 300c has got

30:11.897 --> 30:16.031
the 6.4 liter hemi. V8.

30:16.075 --> 30:18.817
Mm.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.688
I gotta take a leak.

30:24.997 --> 30:26.476
I talked to my dad.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.956
We want to pull you
off the operation.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.958
What are you talking about?

30:30.002 --> 30:31.264
It's getting too dangerous.

30:31.307 --> 30:33.614
Jamie, I'm good. We're about
to make a huge buy.

30:33.657 --> 30:36.878
There's a new guy, Max Fagan.

30:36.922 --> 30:39.141
He's orchestrating
a purchase of 75 guns

30:39.185 --> 30:40.577
he'll bring up from Georgia.

30:40.621 --> 30:42.014
Well, what do we know
about this new guy?

30:42.057 --> 30:43.711
We're meeting him at 2:00
tomorrow to go to the deal.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.669
After that, I'll come in.

30:45.713 --> 30:48.629
All right, make sure
you go in your car, okay?

30:48.672 --> 30:50.587
They're replacing the GPS
tracker on it now.

30:50.631 --> 30:51.806
Copy that.Give me your phone.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.504
I got you one
with a transmitter.

30:54.548 --> 30:55.984
All right. Joe,

30:56.028 --> 30:59.858
If anything doesn't feel safe,
just walk away.
