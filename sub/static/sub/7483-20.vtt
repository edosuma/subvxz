WEBVTT

00:04.005 --> 00:05.104
You got a
problem, Walinski?

00:05.106 --> 00:06.371
(grunting)

00:06.373 --> 00:08.005
Congratulations,
Walinski.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.306
You'll be begging
for some sun.

00:09.308 --> 00:10.707
What are you looking at?!
Get back to work!

00:10.709 --> 00:13.209
You can go back under
when this is done.

00:13.211 --> 00:14.610
Yeah, if we didn't blow
our cover coming out.

00:14.612 --> 00:16.211
Well, that's on you two,
isn't it?

00:21.550 --> 00:23.616
(grunting)

00:32.660 --> 00:34.726
(sighs)

00:42.235 --> 00:45.369
Ugly bastards too scared
to take me on one at a time.

00:45.371 --> 00:49.473
GUARD: You got a real
mouth on you, Callen.

00:49.475 --> 00:52.309
(grunting)

00:52.311 --> 00:56.479
Is that all you got?
(grunts)

00:56.481 --> 00:58.347
(lock buzzes)

00:59.583 --> 01:01.649
Lucky day.

01:01.651 --> 01:04.518
You're going back
to general population.

01:04.520 --> 01:06.586
Let's go.

01:08.122 --> 01:10.188
(indistinct chatter)

01:26.806 --> 01:29.673
Looking pretty good
for six months in the SHU.

01:33.445 --> 01:35.511
Welcome back, Walinski.

01:37.114 --> 01:38.446
Good to see you, brother.

02:02.438 --> 02:04.438
You remember FBI Special Agent
Lisa Rand.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.522
Agent Blye,
Detective Deeks.

02:05.523 --> 02:06.605
Nice to see you.
Hi.
Nice to see you, too.

02:06.608 --> 02:08.174
SAM: All right,
let's go.

02:08.176 --> 02:10.342
Bring 'em up to speed.

02:10.344 --> 02:14.245
RAND: Last year, after a naval
hospital in San Diego closed,

02:14.247 --> 02:16.580
it was discovered that the
facility had been robbed

02:16.582 --> 02:19.849
of its remaining
medical nuclear material.

02:19.851 --> 02:22.284
Left-behind cesium
and cobalt-60.

02:22.286 --> 02:24.552
Now, our CIs tell
us that this man,

02:24.554 --> 02:28.155
Aryan Supreme Alliance Commander
Dallas Alder, has possession

02:28.157 --> 02:29.322
of the material.

02:29.324 --> 02:31.691
He was incarcerated
in Oakville Prison.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.259
Last summer,
Callen successfully infiltrated

02:33.261 --> 02:37.429
the ASA prison gang,
got close to Dallas.

02:37.431 --> 02:38.696
This is when you and Callen
were pulled off the assignment

02:38.698 --> 02:39.697
for the dark net case?

02:39.699 --> 02:41.198
Exactly.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.699
Which was particularly
unfortunate,

02:42.701 --> 02:44.701
considering that Dallas
was subsequently released.

02:44.703 --> 02:46.669
And now all
chatter indicates

02:46.671 --> 02:48.871
that the Aryan Supreme Alliance
is planning

02:48.873 --> 02:54.142
a bombing that will "have more
impact than Oklahoma City."

02:54.144 --> 02:56.577
The fear is
it could be a dirty bomb,

02:56.579 --> 02:59.646
made with the stolen nuclear
material.

02:59.648 --> 03:02.615
Agent Callen was reinserted
into Oakville last week.

03:02.617 --> 03:04.617
The ASA's income is generated
by well-executed

03:04.619 --> 03:07.720
bank robberies
in California and Idaho.

03:07.722 --> 03:09.655
So Callen was accepted into
the gang because of his record

03:09.657 --> 03:11.790
of successful bank robberies.
So, if Dallas

03:11.792 --> 03:13.858
was released, why did
we put Callen back in?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.726
Had to. Last time they saw him,

03:15.728 --> 03:18.528
he was assaulting a guard
and being dragged into solitary.

03:18.530 --> 03:19.695
HETTY:
So the question is,

03:19.697 --> 03:23.231
how do we get Agent Callen out?

03:25.535 --> 03:27.601
(indistinct chatter, grunting)

03:31.607 --> 03:33.940
Walinski!

03:33.942 --> 03:35.441
Charlie.

03:35.443 --> 03:37.309
What's up?
How you been?

03:37.311 --> 03:39.644
Good. I'm okay, you know?

03:39.646 --> 03:43.648
Glad to have you back, man.
It's good to be back,
my man.

03:43.650 --> 03:47.318
Where's, uh...
where's Dallas?

03:47.320 --> 03:48.786
Ah, you know, man.
He did his time.

03:48.788 --> 03:51.288
Got out just after they
threw you in the SHU.

03:51.290 --> 03:53.823
Huh. Lucky bastard.

03:53.825 --> 03:55.291
Right?

03:55.293 --> 03:57.359
You hear from him at all?

03:57.361 --> 03:59.227
Yeah, yeah.
You know, he's got all the guys

03:59.229 --> 04:00.795
watching my back, so...

04:00.797 --> 04:02.530
JIMMIE RAY: Man, you'd be
someone's pretty little wife

04:02.532 --> 04:05.799
by now, if it wasn't
for Dallas and the ASA.

04:05.801 --> 04:08.301
I can take care
of myself.

04:08.303 --> 04:10.369
(chuckles)
Hell, man,

04:10.371 --> 04:12.471
I was born in prison.

04:12.473 --> 04:14.473
Moms had me while she
was doing time up in Folsom.

04:14.475 --> 04:16.575
JIMMIE RAY:
She's not your moms.

04:16.577 --> 04:18.476
She didn't raise you.

04:18.478 --> 04:20.478
Your family's
the Alliance.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.747
We're your mommy,
your daddy, your grandma,

04:23.749 --> 04:25.749
all rolled up into one.

04:25.751 --> 04:27.817
Yeah, I never saw
my moms again.

04:29.754 --> 04:32.421
JIMMIE RAY:
Hey...

04:32.423 --> 04:34.456
my boys
that just got out of the SHU,

04:34.458 --> 04:38.326
they said they never heard
you say one word in there.

04:38.328 --> 04:39.927
(chuckles)
They thought

04:39.929 --> 04:41.428
you'd kilt yourself,

04:41.430 --> 04:43.563
nobody came
and checked the cell.

04:43.565 --> 04:45.865
(chuckles)
Just...

04:45.867 --> 04:47.867
left him hanging there
for his body to rot.

04:47.869 --> 04:49.602
(chuckles)

04:57.478 --> 04:59.478
Another day
in the hot sun.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.413
After six months in SHU,

05:01.415 --> 05:04.015
I'm actually looking
forward to working outside.
(driver groans)

05:04.017 --> 05:05.583
Help me!

05:05.585 --> 05:06.850
Hey, something's wrong.

05:06.852 --> 05:08.318
GUARD:
What's wrong?

05:08.320 --> 05:09.519
Pull over.

05:10.388 --> 05:11.787
Brake! Brake!

05:15.259 --> 05:16.658
(inmates groaning)

05:16.660 --> 05:18.493
(hissing)

05:18.495 --> 05:20.495
If I can get us out
of these cuffs,

05:20.497 --> 05:22.497
you got someone
that can pick us up?

05:22.499 --> 05:24.632
Yeah, my people could be here
in 15 minutes.

05:24.634 --> 05:26.500
You got a phone, genius?

05:26.502 --> 05:27.801
The guard might.

05:32.406 --> 05:34.472
(grunting)

05:38.044 --> 05:39.810
CHARLIE:
Hey, unlock mine.

05:44.416 --> 05:47.450
(inmates murmuring, shouting)

05:47.452 --> 05:48.684
Come on, get up!
INMATE: Yo! Take me!

05:48.686 --> 05:49.951
What about mine?

05:49.953 --> 05:52.520
(inmates murmuring, grumbling)

05:52.522 --> 05:54.522
Bingo.

05:54.524 --> 05:55.489
Yeah. Go.

05:55.491 --> 05:57.557
(inmates shouting)

06:26.520 --> 06:27.952
JIMMIE RAY:
Take these...

06:27.954 --> 06:29.520
out back and burn 'em.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.555
Got it.

06:32.958 --> 06:34.958
King.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.960
You fat bastard.

06:36.962 --> 06:38.962
How the hell are you, brother?

06:38.964 --> 06:40.897
Ginny's got food ready inside.

06:40.899 --> 06:42.565
He a brother?

06:42.567 --> 06:44.833
Not yet. He's good, though.

06:44.835 --> 06:47.936
Walinski, King.

06:58.781 --> 07:01.348
Anybody else want more?

07:01.350 --> 07:03.350
I'm good.
JIMMIE RAY:
Understood.

07:03.352 --> 07:06.353
Got it.
See you soon, brother.

07:06.355 --> 07:07.354
So...

07:07.356 --> 07:09.356
Dallas will be
home tomorrow.

07:09.358 --> 07:10.724
Says he wants
this place clean.

07:10.726 --> 07:15.095
You should shower,
wear something nice.

07:15.097 --> 07:17.630
All right, the timing
could not be better.

07:17.632 --> 07:19.965
The boys here been working
on a bank job,

07:19.967 --> 07:21.967
a big one,
out in Woodland Hills.

07:21.969 --> 07:24.569
Been planning for months.

07:24.571 --> 07:27.004
So Dallas needs another man.

07:27.006 --> 07:28.005
You in?

07:28.007 --> 07:30.374
Yeah, I'm in.

07:31.977 --> 07:34.043
Hey, Kens.

07:37.948 --> 07:39.814
Kens...

07:39.816 --> 07:41.882
Hey.

07:42.818 --> 07:46.019
Sorry.
(clears throat)

07:46.021 --> 07:48.821
He's been going at it
like that for over an hour.

07:48.823 --> 07:51.056
(grunting)

07:51.058 --> 07:54.025
Can you blame him? His partner's
in the wind without overwatch.

07:54.027 --> 07:56.761
White supremacists aren't
exactly his favorite people.

07:56.763 --> 07:58.696
Well, they're not on
my Christmas card list either.

07:58.698 --> 08:01.498
You know,
he once told me

08:01.500 --> 08:04.634
he just wanted a world
without them for his kids.

08:04.636 --> 08:06.736
For all of our kids.
(Sam's phone ringing)

08:06.738 --> 08:09.405
(Deeks' phone ringing)

08:09.407 --> 08:10.606
Something's going on.

08:10.608 --> 08:11.807
Hey.

08:11.809 --> 08:12.908
ERIC:
Callen was able to make a call.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.776
We have an address.
Yeah, I got it.

08:14.778 --> 08:16.511
All right. I'll relay it.
Thanks, brother.
Okay.

08:16.513 --> 08:18.412
What's up?
Callen made contact.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.580
Eric's got a location.
You're up.

08:20.582 --> 08:22.114
All right.

08:22.116 --> 08:24.082
Hey, partner...

08:25.852 --> 08:27.651
Be safe.

08:27.653 --> 08:30.453
Of course.

08:33.191 --> 08:35.457
(engine rumbling)

08:47.070 --> 08:48.569
Hey.

08:48.571 --> 08:51.104
Hey, baby.
How you doing?

08:51.106 --> 08:53.172
(chuckles)

08:54.441 --> 08:57.175
(whispers):
They're following me.

08:57.177 --> 08:59.477
(quietly):
Anything on the bomb?

08:59.479 --> 09:01.479
They got timers and C-4,

09:01.481 --> 09:03.013
but no sign of the
nuclear material.

09:03.015 --> 09:05.015
Okay.
They're also planning
a bank robbery

09:05.017 --> 09:07.584
somewhere in Woodland Hills.

09:07.586 --> 09:10.453
Hetty wants us to solve this
and get out as soon as we can.

09:10.455 --> 09:12.121
Dallas isn't here yet.

09:12.123 --> 09:13.989
(clears throat)

09:13.991 --> 09:16.458
Who's this?

09:17.227 --> 09:19.227
This is Sage.

09:19.229 --> 09:21.696
It's my girl.

09:21.698 --> 09:23.764
No outsiders until
they're cleared with us.
Hey,

09:23.766 --> 09:25.232
I just spent six months
in the SHU,

09:25.234 --> 09:28.602
staring at cinder block walls
with cameras on me 24/7.

09:28.604 --> 09:30.203
We gonna have
a problem?

09:30.205 --> 09:32.205
We're not gonna have a problem.

09:32.207 --> 09:34.207
Let's take it
inside, Romeo.

09:34.209 --> 09:37.075
Hope you boys don't mind
a little noise.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.879
(quietly):
We take turns sleeping,

09:41.881 --> 09:44.282
one of us always on watch.
Oh, yeah.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.817
<i> (knocking on door)</i>

09:46.819 --> 09:48.318
JIMMIE RAY:
Walinski, wake up!

09:48.320 --> 09:51.254
Dallas is here.

09:51.256 --> 09:53.022
Let's go.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.694
(Dallas speaking
indistinctly)

09:59.696 --> 10:01.762
Dallas.

10:06.334 --> 10:08.000
Good to see you again.

10:08.002 --> 10:11.036
SHU didn't hurt you one bit.
No, keep me

10:11.038 --> 10:13.338
in there ten years,
they're not gonna change me.

10:13.340 --> 10:16.007
You should consider joining
the ASA.

10:16.009 --> 10:18.275
Become brothers with us.
Well...

10:18.277 --> 10:20.277
I'm a little bit of a lone wolf,

10:20.279 --> 10:23.013
but, uh, I'll think about it.

10:23.015 --> 10:24.781
You do that.

10:24.783 --> 10:27.283
Hi. I'm Dallas.

10:27.285 --> 10:28.284
Sage.

10:28.286 --> 10:29.618
Why don't you help Ginny

10:29.620 --> 10:30.952
get some breakfast for us.

10:30.954 --> 10:32.753
Charlie, set the table.

10:35.357 --> 10:37.056
Anything you need.

10:38.025 --> 10:39.290
So...

10:39.292 --> 10:41.625
who wants to rob a bank?

10:41.627 --> 10:42.225
Hell, yeah.

10:42.227 --> 10:43.226
Van's loaded.

10:43.228 --> 10:45.027
Just like it'll be on the day.

10:45.029 --> 10:47.763
I figure after we eat,
do a little dry run.

10:47.765 --> 10:50.665
Let's do it.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.368
DALLAS:<i> We put a lot of work</i>
<i> into this.</i>

10:54.370 --> 10:55.869
I got a man on the inside.

10:55.871 --> 10:59.405
He's sympathetic to our cause.

10:59.407 --> 11:02.775
Told us the bank gets a delivery
of cash every Thursday

11:02.777 --> 11:04.309
for a Friday payday.

11:04.311 --> 11:06.644
We're gonna hit it
a week from today.

11:06.646 --> 11:08.712
(phone rings)

11:09.848 --> 11:11.113
MAN (over phone):
Hey.

11:11.115 --> 11:13.648
I was just talking about you.

11:13.650 --> 11:16.017
(man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

11:16.019 --> 11:18.819
I'll call you back.

11:18.821 --> 11:19.920
What is it?

11:19.922 --> 11:22.656
The guard is throwing up
in the bathroom.

11:22.658 --> 11:24.658
The new one is
20 minutes out.

11:24.660 --> 11:25.959
You thinking we go now?

11:25.961 --> 11:28.294
DECKER: It's Friday.
They got the cash.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.262
We got the masks, the ammo?

11:30.264 --> 11:31.930
All here.
Ready to roll, brother.

11:31.932 --> 11:33.965
We don't want to miss
this opportunity.

11:33.967 --> 11:35.800
CALLEN:
It's a bad idea.

11:35.802 --> 11:37.334
Location's no good--
there's too many stoplights

11:37.336 --> 11:38.868
between here and the freeway.

11:38.870 --> 11:40.936
We don't need an escape route.

11:40.938 --> 11:42.170
What do you mean?

11:43.673 --> 11:46.373
Well, why run
when you can kill hostages?

11:46.375 --> 11:48.141
DECKER: We've worked
a long time for this.

11:48.143 --> 11:50.209
Let's do it now.

11:50.211 --> 11:52.077
All right.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.344
We go.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.245
You coming?

12:01.219 --> 12:04.086
¶ ¶

12:22.939 --> 12:24.405
(phone line ringing)

12:24.407 --> 12:26.707
WOMAN:
911. What's your emergency?

12:32.781 --> 12:34.013
Go!

12:36.317 --> 12:38.083
(people gasping, screaming)
Move!

12:38.085 --> 12:40.418
Back up! Back up! Go!

12:40.420 --> 12:42.253
Step away from your drawers!

12:42.255 --> 12:43.787
(people screaming)
Now! Back up!

12:43.789 --> 12:45.421
Don't you move!

12:46.390 --> 12:47.722
Back up!

12:47.724 --> 12:49.457
Back it up!

12:51.761 --> 12:53.894
Anybody moves, you die!

12:53.896 --> 12:57.163
I see a cell phone, you die!

12:58.366 --> 12:59.264
(screaming)

12:59.266 --> 13:02.400
Keep screaming, you die!

13:10.042 --> 13:12.008
MAN:
Don't shoot!

13:13.244 --> 13:15.811
I got the keys.
(guard groaning)

13:17.014 --> 13:18.847
Cameras down.

13:21.151 --> 13:24.986
DALLAS:
This is a bank robbery!

13:24.988 --> 13:27.188
All you need to know is this:

13:27.190 --> 13:29.323
We<i> love</i> killing people
who don't listen,

13:29.325 --> 13:31.258
especially...

13:31.260 --> 13:34.427
black, brown and
yellow ones!

13:34.429 --> 13:36.762
(people gasp, shout)

13:54.848 --> 13:57.215
CHARLIE: Put 'em in the bag.
Put 'em in the bag. Come on.

13:57.217 --> 13:58.849
Cell phones.
Cell phones. Come on.

13:58.851 --> 14:00.450
Put 'em in the bag!
Come on. Cell phones.

14:00.452 --> 14:02.151
Find a room to put 'em all in.

14:02.153 --> 14:03.152
Teller stations.

14:03.154 --> 14:05.354
Vault, with me.

14:11.327 --> 14:12.793
Not that one!
That's a dye pack.

14:12.795 --> 14:14.261
Leave the bottom bill
in every drawer,

14:14.263 --> 14:15.362
otherwise you'll
set off the alarm.

14:15.364 --> 14:17.931
Vault's locked.
CALLEN:
Guys!

14:17.933 --> 14:20.033
We got three minutes before the
cops get here! Let's move it!

14:20.035 --> 14:21.801
I came for the vault.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.571
That vault requires a
key and an iris scan.

14:26.573 --> 14:28.339
The head teller has the key.

14:28.341 --> 14:31.174
The manager has the eyeball.
I know what I'm doing.

14:33.545 --> 14:36.279
Who's the head teller?

14:37.248 --> 14:38.480
Good.

14:38.482 --> 14:39.581
You have the key?

14:39.583 --> 14:40.915
Yes.

14:40.917 --> 14:42.182
And who's the manager?

14:42.184 --> 14:44.250
He left just before you came in.

14:44.252 --> 14:45.884
(people gasping)

14:45.886 --> 14:48.052
(sirens approaching)
They got here too fast.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.453
Get up, blondie!

14:49.455 --> 14:51.021
Get up!
Ow! Aah!

14:51.023 --> 14:52.255
Move!

14:52.257 --> 14:55.391
(sirens wailing,
tires screeching)

14:56.327 --> 14:57.959
(tires screech, sirens stop)

15:03.365 --> 15:05.431
(gunfire continues)

15:05.433 --> 15:08.467
We have hostages,
and we will kill them

15:08.469 --> 15:10.869
with a smile
on our faces!

15:10.871 --> 15:13.204
Stay the hell back!

15:13.206 --> 15:16.273
(sobbing)
Get back to the herd!

15:16.275 --> 15:19.342
Dal... I got a room
we can put 'em in.
Good boy.

15:19.344 --> 15:20.509
Move the hostages inside.

15:20.511 --> 15:22.177
Lock the doors!

15:22.179 --> 15:23.845
Cover the fire exit!

15:23.847 --> 15:25.213
Everybody up!
Hurry up!

15:25.215 --> 15:26.948
CALLEN: Let's go, move it!

15:26.950 --> 15:28.416
Move it!

15:28.418 --> 15:29.450
Got it.

15:29.452 --> 15:31.185
FBI Agent Rand
just got a call

15:31.187 --> 15:33.620
about a bank robbery in progress
in Woodland Hills.

15:33.622 --> 15:36.022
She believes Callen's inside.

15:36.024 --> 15:37.623
I'll call Sam.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.191
(anxious sigh)

15:39.193 --> 15:40.325
Get in the room!

15:40.327 --> 15:42.260
Move! Move!

15:43.329 --> 15:44.961
Where's the head teller?

15:44.963 --> 15:46.629
You got the keys?
Yes.

15:46.631 --> 15:47.896
Now, look...

15:47.898 --> 15:49.464
no heroes here, okay?

15:49.466 --> 15:51.365
You do what I say,

15:51.367 --> 15:53.400
you're gonna get out of here.

15:58.073 --> 16:00.006
I didn't come here
to kill anyone.

16:00.008 --> 16:01.240
Did you?

16:03.377 --> 16:05.510
Good.

16:05.512 --> 16:07.912
Stay with the hostages.

16:08.881 --> 16:11.248
(door opens, closes)

16:11.250 --> 16:13.316
(sirens wailing,
engines revving)

16:19.056 --> 16:21.322
(officers and agents shouting)

16:24.427 --> 16:26.427
Get me connected
to the bank.

16:26.429 --> 16:28.295
Patch it through
to NCIS Ops.

16:28.297 --> 16:29.996
You guys will get the
feed in your comms.

16:29.998 --> 16:32.264
I'll talk to 'em.
Connect me.
TECH: Yes, sir.

16:32.266 --> 16:33.265
(line rings)

16:33.267 --> 16:35.400
(phone rings)

16:35.402 --> 16:38.302
Get your pizza in 20
minutes, or it's free.

16:38.304 --> 16:40.904
You're surrounded-- put down
your weapons and walk out.

16:40.906 --> 16:43.539
I pray to God you're white,
for everybody's sake.

16:43.541 --> 16:45.073
Italian.

16:45.075 --> 16:46.474
FBI Agent Gallow.

16:46.476 --> 16:47.641
That close enough for you?

16:47.643 --> 16:49.109
Barely.

16:49.111 --> 16:51.611
I'll go slow,
so you can keep up.

16:51.613 --> 16:54.647
I need the manager sent in here
so I can stick his eye

16:54.649 --> 16:56.315
in the scanner
and open the vault.

16:56.317 --> 16:59.551
Running voice prints against
recorded prison conversations.

16:59.553 --> 17:02.453
You are speaking
with Dallas Alder.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.354
Hey, Dallas...

17:04.356 --> 17:07.257
Yeah, that's right,
we know who you are.

17:07.259 --> 17:09.425
You're working with Jimmie Ray
Easton and Charlie Conner

17:09.427 --> 17:10.692
and Steven Walinski.

17:10.694 --> 17:12.126
Be smart. Come on.

17:12.128 --> 17:13.727
Live to fight
another day.

17:13.729 --> 17:16.229
Don't tell me about smart--
you're one chromosome away

17:16.231 --> 17:18.097
from being a monkey,
you greasy

17:18.099 --> 17:19.364
piece of garbage.

17:19.366 --> 17:21.432
That's very nice, very classy.

17:21.434 --> 17:23.767
Why are we even talking?

17:23.769 --> 17:26.402
You've got ten minutes
to send in the manager.

17:26.404 --> 17:29.538
After that,
every life I take is on you,

17:29.540 --> 17:30.572
Agent Gallow.

17:30.574 --> 17:32.440
(hangs up)

17:32.442 --> 17:34.175
How the hell are we
getting out of here?

17:34.177 --> 17:36.510
(chuckles)

17:40.415 --> 17:42.782
Can't believe you never
went to school for this--
they're so good.

17:42.784 --> 17:45.050
Oh, Dallas
wouldn't let me.

17:46.219 --> 17:48.619
This is the...
the logo that I designed

17:48.621 --> 17:50.754
for the ASA.
It's an honor,

17:50.756 --> 17:52.689
I guess.

17:52.691 --> 17:54.223
Yeah.

17:54.225 --> 17:56.258
It's good.
It's powerful.

17:56.260 --> 17:58.392
(music playing)

18:02.064 --> 18:03.496
What's this?

18:03.498 --> 18:05.231
Dallas wanted
a picture,

18:05.233 --> 18:08.500
um, of a pile of dead Jews
and blacks with...

18:08.502 --> 18:11.102
a bulldozer
burying the bodies.

18:14.207 --> 18:17.675
Seems like Dallas is
getting ready for a war.

18:17.677 --> 18:20.544
What's he planning?

18:20.546 --> 18:23.780
Oh, I... he doesn't
tell me anything.

18:23.782 --> 18:27.150
Why do you stay with him?

18:28.419 --> 18:31.520
He told me, uh, the only way
I was gonna leave him

18:31.522 --> 18:33.488
was in a body bag.

18:37.694 --> 18:38.826
Connect me.

18:38.828 --> 18:40.527
Mm-hmm.

18:40.529 --> 18:42.095
(line rings)

18:42.097 --> 18:44.097
(phone rings)

18:44.099 --> 18:46.532
Tell me you're sending
in the manager.

18:46.534 --> 18:48.300
SAM:
I'm sending in the manager,

18:48.302 --> 18:49.567
but you got to give me
five hostages.

18:49.569 --> 18:50.868
You get two.

18:50.870 --> 18:52.536
(hangs up)

18:52.538 --> 18:54.604
DEEKS: Come to me,
come to me, come to me.

18:54.606 --> 18:56.623
You're okay. Come to me.

18:56.624 --> 18:58.641
Keep going. You're all right.
Right behind these cars.

18:58.643 --> 18:59.541
You're okay.
(phone rings)

18:59.543 --> 19:01.342
Okay. It's them.

19:01.344 --> 19:03.143
Gallow here.

19:03.145 --> 19:04.777
You have the hostages--

19:04.779 --> 19:06.612
send in the manager.

19:06.614 --> 19:07.846
Sending him in.

19:09.850 --> 19:12.150
Are you willing
to go back into the bank

19:12.152 --> 19:14.652
and open the vault?

19:14.654 --> 19:16.887
Those are my people
in there. Sure.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.656
You boys know
how to do this.

19:22.660 --> 19:24.526
(beep, whirr)

19:24.528 --> 19:26.461
(three beeps, lock clanks)

19:36.706 --> 19:38.772
¶ ¶

19:43.811 --> 19:46.444
(phone rings)

19:46.446 --> 19:48.312
You get what you want?

19:48.314 --> 19:51.548
DALLAS: I get a bus,
you get a third of the hostages.

19:51.550 --> 19:53.683
We go to the airport,
get on a plane,

19:53.685 --> 19:55.685
you get another third
of the hostages.

19:55.687 --> 19:58.220
We land in a country
to be named later,

19:58.222 --> 20:00.422
you get the rest
of the hostages.

20:00.424 --> 20:02.723
You have four hours
to put it together.

20:06.261 --> 20:08.227
Aryans want to purify America,
rebuild it--

20:08.229 --> 20:10.562
why would they want to go
to another country?

20:10.564 --> 20:11.763
I don't know...

20:11.765 --> 20:13.397
but we're on the clock.

20:13.399 --> 20:14.564
How far out is Hostage Rescue?

20:14.566 --> 20:15.765
20 minutes.
It may be easier

20:15.767 --> 20:16.832
to deal with the bad guys

20:16.834 --> 20:18.684
if we get them
outside of the bank.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.535
Get a third of the hostages.
I mean,
I could drive the bus.

20:20.537 --> 20:23.738
That would get me and Callen
on the inside.
Couldn't we rig

20:23.740 --> 20:26.307
the bus with cameras
and let HRT do their thing?

20:26.309 --> 20:28.475
No. That could go bad
ten different ways.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.676
You got anything else?

20:30.645 --> 20:31.677
SAM: Exactly.

20:31.679 --> 20:33.678
Let's do it.

20:36.482 --> 20:37.681
Hey.

20:37.683 --> 20:39.582
Hey. What's going on?

20:39.584 --> 20:41.584
At some point here...

20:41.586 --> 20:43.719
you're gonna have to do
the right thing.

20:43.721 --> 20:46.488
What do you mean, right thing?
I can't tell you that.

20:46.490 --> 20:47.956
You're gonna have
to figure it out yourself.

20:47.958 --> 20:49.624
(door opens)

20:49.626 --> 20:52.393
Walinski,
get back out here.

20:53.729 --> 20:56.529
You don't want to die today,
Charlie, do you?

20:58.199 --> 20:59.698
Good.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.933
'Cause neither do I.

21:04.671 --> 21:06.570
(door opens, closes)

21:12.577 --> 21:14.510
All right...

21:14.512 --> 21:17.312
bus is ready, but HRT
and SWAT both said
they haven't detected

21:17.314 --> 21:18.946
any movement or sound
inside the building

21:18.948 --> 21:20.747
for the last 60 minutes.

21:20.749 --> 21:22.982
Try 'em again.

21:22.984 --> 21:27.519
(line ringing)

21:27.521 --> 21:29.721
Still not answering.
We haven't heard
from them

21:29.723 --> 21:31.339
in almost two hours.

21:31.340 --> 21:32.956
Do you think that Callen
would try to take them?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.825
Did you hear gunshots?
No.

21:34.827 --> 21:35.859
Then he didn't.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.628
Okay. We need to breach.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.731
Something happened,
something changed in there.

21:41.733 --> 21:44.600
Okay, I'll alert HRT.

21:44.602 --> 21:46.368
Let's do it.

22:04.954 --> 22:07.020
He's the only guy in here.

22:14.796 --> 22:16.629
(hostages gasping, murmuring)

22:16.631 --> 22:18.263
Shh...

22:18.265 --> 22:19.697
Hostages are secured.

22:19.699 --> 22:20.731
DEEKS:
Let's roll.

22:20.733 --> 22:21.998
One,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.533
two, three...

22:24.535 --> 22:26.434
(grunts)

22:27.036 --> 22:29.703
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

22:34.976 --> 22:37.910
Sam, you're never going
to believe this.

22:48.321 --> 22:50.487
(indistinct talking)

22:50.489 --> 22:51.721
This runs
to an old sewer tunnel.

22:51.723 --> 22:53.206
They followed that
about a hundred yards

22:53.207 --> 22:54.690
and then bored through
eight feet of soil

22:54.692 --> 22:55.791
to get to the bank's foundation.

22:55.793 --> 22:57.759
It was pre-dug.
All they had to do

22:57.761 --> 22:59.694
was break through a layer
of flooring in the bank.

22:59.696 --> 23:01.062
They must have been working
on it for months.

23:01.064 --> 23:03.030
They needed time, money
and building schematics.

23:03.032 --> 23:04.798
I mean,
this is a professional job.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.183
SAM:
Threatening to kill hostages

23:06.184 --> 23:07.567
was just a ploy to keep us
from coming inside.

23:07.569 --> 23:10.570
They got away with
over $2.5 million.

23:10.572 --> 23:12.505
Get Blye. We need to talk
to the girlfriend

23:12.507 --> 23:14.157
and get inside that house.

23:14.158 --> 23:15.808
See if there's any evidence
of the nuclear material.

23:15.810 --> 23:17.843
On it.

23:17.845 --> 23:19.344
What we know at this point is
(phone ringing)

23:19.346 --> 23:20.678
a little after 1:00 p.m.,

23:20.680 --> 23:22.513
several men entered
the Certified National Bank.

23:22.515 --> 23:23.780
KENSI:
Hey.

23:24.749 --> 23:26.548
No, it's not going
to be a problem.

23:26.550 --> 23:28.583
Mm-hmm. Door's open.

23:28.585 --> 23:30.651
(reporter continues
indistinctly)

23:32.087 --> 23:35.655
Ginny, I've got to
tell you something.

23:35.657 --> 23:37.957
I'm not really Steven's
girlfriend.

23:37.959 --> 23:40.659
I'm a federal agent
investigating ASA.

23:40.661 --> 23:43.028
(door opens, Ginny gasps)

23:43.030 --> 23:44.897
(door closes)

23:44.898 --> 23:46.765
We're going to have
to take you in.

24:01.948 --> 24:04.748
DALLAS:
Decker, King,

24:04.750 --> 24:06.983
take turns watching
the front.

24:06.985 --> 24:09.018
KING:
I'll go first.

24:09.020 --> 24:11.120
Take this spool,
run it to the outside,

24:11.122 --> 24:12.721
see if we get a signal.

24:13.690 --> 24:15.523
I'll go with him.

24:15.525 --> 24:17.791
Give me the gun, Walinski.

24:17.793 --> 24:18.925
Why?

24:18.927 --> 24:20.126
'Cause it's mine.
I gave it to you.

24:20.128 --> 24:21.760
I want it back.

24:23.797 --> 24:26.497
(clears throat)

24:30.536 --> 24:32.502
Let's go.

24:37.075 --> 24:39.742
What's your plan
after this?

24:39.744 --> 24:41.744
I don't know.

24:41.746 --> 24:43.011
I might be able to help
get you a job.

24:43.013 --> 24:45.078
Get your life on track.

24:48.550 --> 24:51.083
Why do you keep trying
to help me?

24:52.052 --> 24:54.852
I never knew my mom
or dad either.

24:54.854 --> 24:58.856
Look, even if you have to walk
away from this with no money...

24:58.858 --> 25:01.024
you got to get out of this life.

25:01.026 --> 25:03.726
There's a better ways to live
than to hate the whole world.

25:03.728 --> 25:06.228
DALLAS:
Walinski, you get that run yet?

25:06.230 --> 25:07.696
Yeah, just about.

25:07.698 --> 25:08.930
Charlie, take the car

25:08.932 --> 25:11.799
and dump it about four
or five miles from here.

25:11.801 --> 25:13.734
Use the bus when you come back.

25:13.736 --> 25:16.069
Walk the last mile.

25:16.071 --> 25:18.004
Why don't you, uh, let me
finish, I'll go with him.

25:18.006 --> 25:20.873
No, no,
I want you to stay close.

25:20.875 --> 25:22.541
Charlie's less conspicuous.

25:22.543 --> 25:25.610
You know what "conspicuous"
means, don't you, Charlie?

25:25.612 --> 25:26.811
Yeah, you told me once.

25:26.813 --> 25:28.245
Um...

25:28.247 --> 25:29.846
something you notice?

25:29.848 --> 25:32.982
Yeah, that's exactly right,
something you notice.

25:32.984 --> 25:34.750
Go get rid of the car.

25:35.719 --> 25:37.785
Let's finish this up.

25:39.989 --> 25:42.255
Why don't you, uh,

25:42.257 --> 25:44.190
tell me again
what happened back there.

25:44.192 --> 25:46.091
I told you.

25:46.093 --> 25:47.525
Yeah, I know,
but we were running,

25:47.527 --> 25:49.860
so I-I didn't really get
all of it.

25:49.862 --> 25:51.995
You guys ran down the tunnel.

25:51.997 --> 25:53.129
I went back to check
and make sure

25:53.131 --> 25:54.997
that the hostages
were all locked up.

25:54.999 --> 25:57.065
Jimmie Ray said
he saw something

25:57.067 --> 25:59.634
moving by the front door,
so he went to check it out.

25:59.636 --> 26:00.935
Sniper must have got him
through the glass,

26:00.937 --> 26:04.037
because next thing I know...

26:05.707 --> 26:07.940
...the, uh, FBI SWAT

26:07.942 --> 26:09.975
was hauling towards
the front door.

26:09.977 --> 26:12.010
You didn't check to see
if he was alive?

26:12.012 --> 26:13.644
I didn't have time.

26:13.646 --> 26:15.712
I was running for the tunnel.

26:16.681 --> 26:19.165
Let's get the TV on.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.650
Maybe they'll say something
about Jimmie Ray being alive.

26:22.619 --> 26:25.219
Yeah, let's do that.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.991
(claps loudly)
Stay with me, genius.

26:30.993 --> 26:33.026
Why do you think you were
left behind, Jimmie Ray?

26:33.028 --> 26:35.728
Me and Walinski
were last in the bank.

26:35.730 --> 26:38.097
He told me to go
check on the hostages.

26:38.099 --> 26:41.100
Next thing I know, I wake up
zip-tied to the vault.

26:41.102 --> 26:43.635
You were left behind
as a bread crumb

26:43.637 --> 26:46.070
so we could find Dallas.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.806
The man you know
as Steven Walinski

26:48.808 --> 26:50.941
is actually an
undercover agent.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.309
Hey, I know you.

26:54.845 --> 26:56.711
You're a guard at Oakville.

26:56.713 --> 26:58.079
And on the bus.

26:58.081 --> 27:00.114
It's all smoke and
mirrors, Jimmie Ray.

27:00.116 --> 27:01.982
You've been played
top-to-bottom, inside and out

27:01.984 --> 27:05.085
by a black federal agent.

27:05.087 --> 27:07.821
We got you signed, sealed and
delivered back to prison.

27:07.823 --> 27:10.757
You want less time,
you got to start talking now.

27:10.759 --> 27:12.725
Because I need to know
where Dallas is.

27:12.727 --> 27:13.959
When the white revolution
comes...

27:13.961 --> 27:15.160
It's not gonna happen, Jimmie.
Yes, it is.

27:15.162 --> 27:17.162
No, it ain't.
Know why?

27:17.163 --> 27:19.163
Because of all the poor
white men in this country

27:19.166 --> 27:20.965
with no jobs,

27:20.967 --> 27:22.633
no hope.

27:22.635 --> 27:25.802
You see, you and your
African president

27:25.804 --> 27:28.638
have already taken
everything from us.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.906
So now...

27:30.908 --> 27:34.109
we got nothing to lose.

27:34.111 --> 27:36.377
You know, that's funny...

27:36.379 --> 27:37.978
because...

27:37.980 --> 27:41.647
that sounds just like
poor black men to me.

27:44.652 --> 27:47.352
I got this. Thanks.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.760
Look at these
for me, Ginny.

28:00.064 --> 28:01.396
All these women

28:01.398 --> 28:04.065
are from various
white supremacist groups.

28:04.067 --> 28:06.000
They stood by their men

28:06.002 --> 28:07.134
and now they're doing
ten-plus years

28:07.136 --> 28:09.236
in prison
because of it.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.040
I want you to do something
for me.

28:14.042 --> 28:16.375
Okay, Ginny?

28:16.377 --> 28:20.078
I want you to value yourself.

28:22.182 --> 28:25.883
Where did Dallas plan on going
after he hit the bank?

28:25.885 --> 28:27.851
I... I don't know.

28:27.853 --> 28:28.985
You must have overheard
something.

28:28.987 --> 28:30.686
He always made me
leave the room.

28:30.688 --> 28:32.921
Told me to do the dishes

28:32.923 --> 28:34.322
or-or make the bed.

28:34.324 --> 28:36.257
He... he'd pull the little hairs
on the back of my neck

28:36.259 --> 28:37.658
if he caught me sitting idle.

28:37.660 --> 28:38.859
Just think.

28:38.861 --> 28:41.127
You must've heard a street name,

28:41.129 --> 28:42.695
a neighborhood.

28:42.697 --> 28:44.430
Come on, help me help you.

28:44.432 --> 28:46.965
I don't know, I don't know.

28:46.967 --> 28:48.833
Why, why, why?

28:48.835 --> 28:52.102
Why are you with a person
like Dallas?

28:52.104 --> 28:55.672
Isn't it obvious?

28:57.942 --> 29:00.442
Look at me.

29:00.444 --> 29:04.012
Who else would want me?

29:04.014 --> 29:06.880
(crying)

29:10.185 --> 29:11.684
REPORTER: When the FBI entered
the building,

29:11.686 --> 29:13.452
the masked men
were no longer inside.

29:13.454 --> 29:15.921
The bank robbers somehow
got out of the bank,

29:15.923 --> 29:17.088
past the FBI and police.

29:17.090 --> 29:18.856
(turns off TV)

29:18.858 --> 29:23.026
I'm not hearing anything about
FBI shooting or killing anybody,

29:23.028 --> 29:24.827
or storming the bank.

29:24.829 --> 29:28.096
The FBI controls the information
that's fed to the press.

29:33.469 --> 29:35.302
You don't believe me?

29:35.304 --> 29:36.870
What do you think I'm hiding?

29:36.872 --> 29:38.905
I don't know.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.439
But I'm going to find out.

29:40.441 --> 29:42.040
(grunts)

29:43.376 --> 29:45.376
(grunting)

29:45.378 --> 29:47.444
(blows thudding)

29:58.890 --> 30:01.757
When Dallas would leave,
how long would he be gone for?

30:01.759 --> 30:03.759
He would leave
at different times.

30:03.761 --> 30:06.294
When he would come home,
he'd take a shower,

30:06.296 --> 30:07.846
I'd do the laundry.

30:07.847 --> 30:09.397
You'd do the laundry
because his clothes were dirty?

30:09.399 --> 30:10.731
Yeah. They were covered
with dirt.

30:10.733 --> 30:12.032
Okay, he and his men

30:12.033 --> 30:13.332
were digging a tunnel
but they also had to figure out

30:13.335 --> 30:16.469
a hideout, somewhere to go
after the robbery.

30:16.471 --> 30:19.939
How long would he be gone
when his clothes weren't dirty?

30:21.409 --> 30:23.409
It might tell us how far
away he was travelling.

30:23.411 --> 30:25.411
Was there a pattern to it?

30:25.413 --> 30:28.380
No, he would come and go at
different times, different days.

30:29.349 --> 30:31.449
(sighs)

30:32.819 --> 30:35.753
When he came home
when his clothes were clean,

30:35.755 --> 30:38.422
he always brought me paper
to do my drawings.

30:38.424 --> 30:40.123
(laughs softly)

30:42.961 --> 30:44.260
Have Deeks send over
Ginny's drawings

30:44.262 --> 30:45.961
from the house, quickly.

30:45.963 --> 30:47.495
On it.

30:47.497 --> 30:48.996
Hey, Deeks,
we need the drawings.
Yeah? Drawings.

30:48.998 --> 30:50.263
Yeah.
Okay, got it.

30:50.265 --> 30:51.442
Yeah, all of them.
What else?

30:51.443 --> 30:52.620
Any other material
you might find...

30:52.621 --> 30:53.798
Detective, you should see this.
Hold on a second.

30:53.801 --> 30:55.267
Is that what I think it is?

30:55.269 --> 30:57.102
It's called a PIG.

30:57.104 --> 30:59.437
It's leadlined,
used for safely holding

30:59.439 --> 31:01.105
highly radioactive compounds.

31:01.107 --> 31:03.040
Assistant Director, we found
the missing nuclear material.

31:03.042 --> 31:04.341
Good.

31:04.343 --> 31:06.109
This mission is now about
one thing--

31:06.111 --> 31:07.276
finding and extricating
Agent Callen.

31:07.278 --> 31:08.377
DEEKS:
Got it.

31:08.379 --> 31:09.511
Ah, excuse me.

31:09.513 --> 31:11.145
I've almost got this,

31:11.147 --> 31:13.380
but, uh, what do
you like better,

31:13.382 --> 31:15.782
the pencil skirt
or the mini?

31:15.784 --> 31:16.983
Jimmie Ray does have
excellent legs.

31:16.985 --> 31:18.351
You got to flaunt them,
Mr. Beale.

31:18.353 --> 31:19.452
Miniskirt, definitely.

31:19.454 --> 31:21.887
All right.
I'll get it over to Sam.

31:21.889 --> 31:23.521
We are going to find Dallas,

31:23.523 --> 31:26.123
we're going to dump you
back into prison

31:26.125 --> 31:29.392
and put the word out that you
told us where Dallas was.

31:29.394 --> 31:31.060
Now, you do that, boy.

31:31.062 --> 31:32.995
Those are my brothers.

31:32.997 --> 31:34.529
They'll know I never did that.

31:34.531 --> 31:36.130
ERIC (over earphone):
Sam, on your phone.

31:36.132 --> 31:38.198
(phone chimes)

31:42.370 --> 31:44.069
(chuckles)

31:44.071 --> 31:45.070
You're right.

31:45.072 --> 31:46.971
It's just talk.

31:46.973 --> 31:50.808
But a picture is worth
a thousand words, huh?

31:54.947 --> 31:57.380
And there's more.

31:57.382 --> 31:59.416
Don't get me wrong.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.685
I mean, I have nothing against
men wearing women's clothing.

32:02.687 --> 32:05.521
It's a free country, it's
the American Way, but...

32:05.523 --> 32:07.422
I can't imagine
the Aryan Brothers

32:07.424 --> 32:10.091
being as open-minded as I am.

32:10.093 --> 32:12.026
The man you know
as Steven Walinski

32:12.028 --> 32:14.528
is my partner.

32:14.530 --> 32:16.563
My brother.

32:16.565 --> 32:19.098
So, understand this.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.533
I will not hesitate

32:21.535 --> 32:24.235
to throw you back to the hyenas.

32:24.237 --> 32:26.537
You understand me?

32:26.539 --> 32:31.241
Now, where's Dallas planning
to go after the robbery?

32:31.243 --> 32:33.509
I just got out of prison
a day ago, man.

32:33.511 --> 32:35.544
I was never part
of the planning.

32:35.546 --> 32:37.178
Give me something, Jimmie.

32:37.180 --> 32:38.512
(groans)
I need more than that.

32:38.514 --> 32:41.381
He said something
about an abandoned factory.

32:41.383 --> 32:42.448
Still not enough.

32:42.450 --> 32:44.266
It's all I got.

32:44.267 --> 32:46.083
Well, that's not going
to be enough to save you,

32:46.086 --> 32:49.220
if something happens
to my partner...

32:49.222 --> 32:51.255
boy.

32:52.224 --> 32:54.591
If we ever cross paths
on the street...

32:54.593 --> 32:56.359
Yeah?

32:56.361 --> 32:59.295
I want to kill you...

32:59.297 --> 33:02.197
like the animal you are.

33:06.603 --> 33:09.036
When you're back
in that box,

33:09.038 --> 33:13.540
I want you to hold onto
the hate real tight,

33:13.542 --> 33:17.009
because that's all you got.

33:20.381 --> 33:22.547
(beep)
Eric, Nell...

33:22.549 --> 33:24.181
did you figure out where
the paper came from?

33:24.183 --> 33:26.616
No. We analyzed the weave,
the type of fiber

33:26.618 --> 33:28.517
and the dye used
to make the paper,

33:28.519 --> 33:30.418
which did lead us
to the manufacturer.

33:30.420 --> 33:31.753
But then, we
hit a dead end.

33:31.754 --> 33:33.087
Turns out that company's
been out of business

33:33.089 --> 33:34.254
for almost two years.

33:34.256 --> 33:35.421
SAM:
Wait a second.

33:35.423 --> 33:37.389
Jimmie Ray said
Dallas told him something

33:37.391 --> 33:39.457
about going
to abandoned factory.

33:39.459 --> 33:40.491
KENSI:
So, what if Dallas

33:40.493 --> 33:42.192
didn't buy the paper at a store?

33:42.194 --> 33:44.394
What if it's leftover stock
from the abandoned factory?

33:44.396 --> 33:46.529
Send the addresses
to our phone. Come on.

33:46.531 --> 33:47.630
Meet you there.

33:49.667 --> 33:52.534
The police entered the building
shortly after 4:15 p.m.

33:52.536 --> 33:55.637
They were expecting a gun
battle, but no shots were fired.

33:55.639 --> 33:58.206
And we're confirming all
of the hostages were rescued

33:58.208 --> 33:59.407
and are uninjured...

33:59.409 --> 34:00.608
(grunts, gasps)

34:00.610 --> 34:03.410
DALLAS:
Wake up, Walinski.

34:03.412 --> 34:06.613
They're still not
saying anything about

34:06.615 --> 34:08.281
Jimmie Ray being alive.
(groans, gasps)

34:08.283 --> 34:09.749
TV REPORTER:
The FBI does know the identities

34:09.751 --> 34:11.016
of some of the suspects...

34:11.018 --> 34:12.717
It'll come out...
I promise you.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.618
(on TV): We're going to be
giving you a number

34:14.620 --> 34:15.969
to an FBI hotline.

34:15.970 --> 34:17.319
We'll have that
in a few minutes.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.422
Bill, the scene here
brings back the...

34:19.424 --> 34:22.491
You know, according
to the news...

34:22.493 --> 34:24.626
they didn't even enter the bank

34:24.628 --> 34:26.427
until 90 minutes
after we left.

34:26.429 --> 34:28.128
Oh...
(stammers, gasps)

34:28.130 --> 34:30.130
For all we know, Jimmie's...

34:30.132 --> 34:31.698
Jimmie's still alive, you know?

34:31.700 --> 34:34.067
I mean, he'd be talking to 'em.

34:34.069 --> 34:35.768
They wouldn't want us
to know that.

34:35.770 --> 34:39.371
I had all of my boys talk
to everybody in the SHU.

34:39.373 --> 34:42.807
Not one person heard your voice
in there.

34:42.809 --> 34:45.209
I keep my mouth shut,

34:45.211 --> 34:48.244
so that makes me a liar?

34:51.382 --> 34:53.515
Yeah. I think it does.

34:53.517 --> 34:55.049
Come on, man.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.251
Fumes could ignite.

34:57.253 --> 34:59.519
Why would I lie?!

34:59.521 --> 35:03.556
'Cause I think you're a cop.

35:09.497 --> 35:11.530
Hi. Hi.

35:11.532 --> 35:13.431
I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm a little lost.

35:13.433 --> 35:14.832
I was wondering
if you could help me.

35:14.834 --> 35:16.834
My GPS is not working properly
on the phone.

35:16.836 --> 35:18.569
I just don't know
what to do with it.

35:18.571 --> 35:21.071
Do you think that you could
help me get to the 110?

35:44.162 --> 35:46.529
(grunts)
Aah! Oh!

35:46.531 --> 35:48.664
(groans)
Oh.

35:52.770 --> 35:54.202
(knife clicks, slides;
muffled groan)

35:54.837 --> 35:56.536
(sighs)
(grunts)

35:58.573 --> 35:59.838
I think he broke my leg.

35:59.840 --> 36:02.106
Shh. I got this.

36:02.875 --> 36:04.574
(panting)

36:08.146 --> 36:09.645
You know, we did this

36:09.647 --> 36:12.681
once before, to a Mexican kid,
when we were bored.

36:12.683 --> 36:15.617
Funny thing is,
after he was burned,

36:15.619 --> 36:18.553
and the flames went out,
thought he was dead.

36:20.590 --> 36:23.891
Then he started moving,
asking for his mamacita.

36:23.893 --> 36:27.361
How do you even sleep at night?

36:27.363 --> 36:29.496
So, you<i> are</i> a cop.

36:29.498 --> 36:31.564
(Callen gasps)

36:31.566 --> 36:34.300
Even worse.

36:34.302 --> 36:36.635
A federal agent.

36:36.637 --> 36:40.872
You know, it's very brave of you
to confess that.

36:40.874 --> 36:43.174
Not really.

36:44.610 --> 36:46.610
'Cause now...

36:46.612 --> 36:48.678
he's gonna shoot you.

36:55.319 --> 36:57.319
Don't move.

36:57.321 --> 36:59.387
Don't twitch.

36:59.389 --> 37:01.288
Don't even breathe.

37:01.290 --> 37:03.690
You shoot me,
the cigarette drops.

37:03.692 --> 37:06.259
You have to decide
whether you want to live or die.

37:06.261 --> 37:08.327
Toss the cigarette away.

37:08.329 --> 37:11.596
Are you prepared for the
consequences of your actions?

37:11.598 --> 37:14.699
Are you prepared for a black man
to take you out of this world?

37:14.701 --> 37:17.601
You gonna come visit him
when he looks like a hot dog

37:17.603 --> 37:19.603
been left on the grill too long?

37:19.605 --> 37:21.170
Stop moving.

37:23.807 --> 37:25.373
Charlie...

37:25.375 --> 37:27.208
Drop your gun.

37:27.210 --> 37:29.376
Charlie, don't.

37:29.378 --> 37:30.777
This is my friend,
Charlie.

37:30.779 --> 37:32.812
This is my partner.

37:32.814 --> 37:34.814
DALLAS:
They're Feds, Charlie.

37:34.816 --> 37:36.649
Shoot him
and let's get out of here.

37:36.651 --> 37:37.850
Charlie, don't do it.

37:37.852 --> 37:40.719
You remember what
we talked about?

37:40.721 --> 37:43.221
This is it.

37:43.223 --> 37:45.656
The time to do the right thing.

37:45.658 --> 37:47.591
What the hell are you doing?
I said, shoot him!

37:47.593 --> 37:49.626
CALLEN:
Charlie...

37:49.628 --> 37:51.628
Don't do it, Charlie.

37:51.630 --> 37:53.863
I love you, Charlie.
You're like my son.

37:53.865 --> 37:55.698
CALLEN:
No, he doesn't, Charlie.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.599
Don't listen to him.

37:57.601 --> 37:58.866
Charlie...

37:58.868 --> 38:01.535
I can't, Dallas.

38:01.537 --> 38:02.869
I'm really sorry.

38:02.871 --> 38:04.637
(gunshot, Charlie grunts)

38:05.740 --> 38:08.474
(grunting)

38:08.476 --> 38:11.443
Go ahead, move.
(whimpers)

38:11.445 --> 38:12.577
I'll sleep great tonight.

38:12.579 --> 38:15.446
(groaning)
Turn over.

38:15.448 --> 38:17.281
You okay?
Yeah.

38:17.283 --> 38:19.283
(Charlie gasping weakly)

38:19.285 --> 38:20.751
CALLEN:
Charlie?!

38:20.753 --> 38:23.386
Callen, Sam, you good?
CALLEN:
Get me out of these.

38:23.388 --> 38:24.920
Deeks, get an ambulance!

38:24.922 --> 38:26.521
Eric, uh, we got
a gunshot victim.

38:26.523 --> 38:27.722
We need an ambulance.
ERIC:
Got it.

38:30.626 --> 38:32.792
DEEKS: Callen, ambulance
is six minutes out.

38:32.794 --> 38:34.360
Charlie...

38:34.362 --> 38:36.695
Hang in there, Charlie.

38:38.799 --> 38:40.799
I don't understand.

38:40.801 --> 38:42.901
It's okay.
Keep... keep breathing.

38:42.903 --> 38:44.469
(shallow, weak breathing)

38:44.471 --> 38:46.304
CALLEN:
Come on, stay with me.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.306
(gasping)

38:49.308 --> 38:50.840
Keep breathing, Charlie.

38:50.842 --> 38:52.508
Look at me!

38:52.510 --> 38:53.542
(panting)

38:53.544 --> 38:55.644
Charlie?!

38:55.646 --> 38:57.445
(panting)

38:57.447 --> 38:59.013
Callen, he's gone.

38:59.015 --> 39:01.281
(sighing)

39:13.528 --> 39:15.528
Agent Callen...

39:15.530 --> 39:17.429
he was a known felon

39:17.431 --> 39:20.298
who had a gun aimed
at a federal agent's head.

39:20.300 --> 39:22.300
Are we good?

39:22.302 --> 39:24.535
Yeah, we're good.

39:42.621 --> 39:44.988
Hetty said you'd be here.

39:49.694 --> 39:51.760
This thing really
tearing you up?

39:53.697 --> 39:55.763
This racist kid?

39:57.466 --> 39:59.599
(tires screeching, thudding,
siren blaring)

39:59.601 --> 40:02.969
(groans, panting)

40:11.512 --> 40:13.778
G, why are we here?

40:15.314 --> 40:18.915
I ran away
from my last foster family.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.350
I robbed a storage locker,
I got caught.

40:21.352 --> 40:24.720
I spent three weeks in juvie.

40:24.722 --> 40:27.789
It was hell.

40:27.791 --> 40:30.992
So I escaped, I stole a car,

40:30.994 --> 40:32.793
and I crashed

40:32.795 --> 40:34.628
into that pole.

40:34.630 --> 40:36.730
(grunting)

40:36.732 --> 40:40.166
My whole life was over...
right here.

40:40.168 --> 40:43.068
<i> And then, the...</i>

40:43.070 --> 40:45.804
hand of God intervened.

40:51.044 --> 40:54.444
I just keep asking
myself, why me?

40:57.715 --> 40:59.915
Charlie was on that same path.

41:01.785 --> 41:05.453
Now he's dead
before he ever got started.

41:05.455 --> 41:06.787
Maybe it has something to do

41:06.789 --> 41:09.790
with the content
of your character.

41:09.792 --> 41:12.459
No.

41:12.461 --> 41:14.694
No, Hetty saved me.

41:20.500 --> 41:24.534
<i> Everything I am today</i>
<i> is because of her.</i>

41:26.104 --> 41:28.104
Well,

41:28.106 --> 41:31.073
you should tell her.

41:33.877 --> 41:35.776
Come on.

41:35.778 --> 41:37.477
Korean barbecue.

41:37.479 --> 41:39.479
Kensi and Deeks
are meeting us.

41:39.481 --> 41:41.547
I'm starving.

41:45.886 --> 41:48.686
(sighs heavily)

41:50.856 --> 41:52.989
OFFICER:
<i> I don't know who you are,</i>

41:52.991 --> 41:54.623
<i> or what strings you pulled,</i>

41:54.625 --> 41:58.760
but this kid just crashed
though two LAPD cruisers.

41:58.762 --> 42:01.796
That is an assault on a officer
with a deadly weapon.

42:01.798 --> 42:03.631
He should be tried as an adult.

42:03.633 --> 42:05.265
Your objections are noted.

42:10.137 --> 42:11.803
What?

42:11.805 --> 42:14.639
Very impressive, Mr. Callen.

42:14.641 --> 42:19.509
Very impressive, indeed.

42:21.212 --> 42:23.278
You're really short.

42:24.247 --> 42:26.981
(laughs)

42:28.584 --> 42:30.817
You taking me back
to Social Services?

42:30.819 --> 42:33.986
No.

42:33.988 --> 42:36.621
You're never
going there again.

42:36.623 --> 42:40.725
You can stay with me...

42:40.727 --> 42:42.259
for as long as you like.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.597
I've been watching you...

42:47.599 --> 42:50.732
for quite a while.

42:54.003 --> 42:56.736
You have great potential.

42:58.940 --> 43:01.807
And I have a plan
for you, Mr. Callen.
