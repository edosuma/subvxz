1 degree to overlap.

00:16.082 --> 00:18.107
Stand by to photograph.

00:24.124 --> 00:25.386
Now.

00:34.167 --> 00:37.659
Three days of this now, sir.

00:37.771 --> 00:41.832
Other ships must have
made star maps of some of this.

00:41.941 --> 00:42.999
Negative, Lieutenant.

00:43.109 --> 00:45.270
We are the first
to reach this far.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.505
[Beeping]

00:47.614 --> 00:49.343
Sir, contact with an object.

00:49.449 --> 00:50.780
It's moving toward us.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.784
No visual contact yet.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.353
Deflectors, full intensity.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.012
It's coming at light speed.

00:56.122 --> 00:57.521
Collision course.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.319
Evasive maneuvers, Mr. Sulu.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.451
Object changing
direction, too, sir.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.553
Keeps coming at us.

01:06.499 --> 01:08.091
No signal from it, sir.

01:08.201 --> 01:10.101
Still collision course.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.962
Deflectors aren't stopping it.

01:13.073 --> 01:13.971
Sound alarm.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.974
It's slowing down,
Mr. Spock.

01:16.076 --> 01:16.974
Countermand alarm.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.635
All engines full stop.

01:19.979 --> 01:21.537
Visual contact.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.007
Ahead slow.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.669
Steer a course
around it, Mr. Sulu.

02:18.037 --> 02:19.334
It's blocking the way!

02:19.439 --> 02:21.771
Quite unnecessary to raise
your voice, Mr. Bailey.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.502
All engines stop.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.339
Sound the alert.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.810
Bridge to all decks--
condition alert.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.976
All decks--
condition alert.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.816
Captain Kirk to the bridge.

02:43.463 --> 02:47.627
Space--
the final frontier.

02:47.734 --> 02:51.226
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.998
Its five-year mission--

02:53.106 --> 02:56.234
to explore
strange new worlds...

02:56.342 --> 03:00.244
to seek out new life
and new civilizations...

03:00.346 --> 03:03.838
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

03:37.016 --> 03:39.985
Captain's Log,
star date 1512.2.

03:40.086 --> 03:42.486
On our third day
of star mapping,

03:42.589 --> 03:43.817
an unexplained cubical object

03:43.923 --> 03:45.356
blocked our vessel's path.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.584
On the bridge,

03:46.693 --> 03:49.093
Mr. Spock immediately
ordered general alert.

03:49.195 --> 03:50.719
My location--sick bay.

03:50.830 --> 03:53.196
Quarterly physical check.

03:53.299 --> 03:54.857
Whew!

03:54.968 --> 03:56.663
Just a few seconds more.

03:56.769 --> 03:59.533
Just a few seconds more.

03:59.639 --> 04:00.970
[Grumbling]

04:05.878 --> 04:07.778
That's a boy. Keep it up.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.711
A little sweat
will do you good.

04:09.816 --> 04:11.249
You're killing me.

04:19.158 --> 04:20.557
You're killing me.

04:26.299 --> 04:27.288
Stop.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.796
Winded?

04:31.904 --> 04:34.771
You'd be the last one I'd tell.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.748
Kirk here.
What's going on?

04:45.852 --> 04:47.752
Have a look at this, Captain.

04:55.595 --> 04:56.425
What's that?

04:56.529 --> 04:57.587
Undetermined.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.097
Whatever it is,
it's blocking our way.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.131
When we move, it moves.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.496
A vessel of some kind?

05:02.602 --> 05:05.093
Negative.
More some type of device.

05:05.204 --> 05:06.603
I'll be right up.

05:08.207 --> 05:10.107
You could see
the alarm lights.

05:10.209 --> 05:11.608
Why didn't you tell me?

05:11.711 --> 05:13.269
Finally finished
a physical on you.

05:13.379 --> 05:17.281
What am l, a doctor
or a moon shuttle conductor?

05:17.383 --> 05:20.284
If I jumped every time
a light came on,

05:20.386 --> 05:22.581
I'd end up
talking to myself.

05:22.689 --> 05:24.589
All decks alert.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.090
[Alarm Sounds]

05:27.894 --> 05:29.293
All decks alert.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.072
Bridge.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.478
Captain to Bridge.

05:47.580 --> 05:48.478
Spock here.

05:48.581 --> 05:49.411
Any changes?

05:49.515 --> 05:50.482
Negative.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.813
It seems to want
to hold us here.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.318
Any indication of danger?

05:54.420 --> 05:55.819
Negative.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.321
I'll change first then.

05:57.423 --> 05:58.321
Captain out.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.262
All decks have reported green,
Mr. Bailey.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.287
Yes, sir.

06:06.399 --> 06:08.765
The captain will expect
a full report on--

06:08.868 --> 06:10.267
The cube's range
and position.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.770
I'll have it by then.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.271
Raising my voice back there

06:14.374 --> 06:17.775
doesn't mean I was scared
or couldn't do my job.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.777
It means I have
a human thing

06:19.879 --> 06:21.278
called an adrenaline gland.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.780
It sounds most
inconvenient.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.941
Have you considered
having it removed?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.278
Very funny.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.788
You try to cross
brains with Spock,

06:30.890 --> 06:33.484
he'll cut you to
pieces every time.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.494
Captain to Bridge.

06:37.597 --> 06:38.495
Spock here.

06:38.598 --> 06:39.462
Signs of life?

06:39.565 --> 06:40.497
Negative.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.931
Have you tried all
hailing frequencies?

06:42.034 --> 06:42.864
Affirmative.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.061
No answer.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.468
Have the department heads
meet me on the bridge.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.470
Already standing by.

07:00.019 --> 07:01.247
[Beeping]

07:10.863 --> 07:11.761
Reporting, sir.

07:11.864 --> 07:13.525
Sensors show
it is solid,

07:13.633 --> 07:16.033
but its composition
is unknown to us.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.033
Lieutenant Uhura.

07:17.136 --> 07:19.434
Hailing frequencies
still open, sir.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.530
I get no message from it.

07:27.780 --> 07:28.974
Navigation.

07:29.081 --> 07:33.245
Distance from us--
1,593 meters, position constant.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.288
Each of its edges
measures 107 meters.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.291
Mass, a little under
11,000 metric tons.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.451
Scotty.

07:41.561 --> 07:42.960
Mode of power.

07:43.062 --> 07:44.962
Beats me what makes it go.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.793
I'll buy speculation.

07:46.899 --> 07:49.299
I'd sell it if I had any.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.460
That's a solid cube.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.470
How it can sense us coming,

07:52.572 --> 07:54.301
block us, move when we move--

07:54.407 --> 07:55.339
it beats me.

07:55.441 --> 07:57.409
That's my report.

07:59.579 --> 08:00.739
Life sciences.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.109
Same report.

08:02.215 --> 08:05.241
Sir, we going to just let
it hold us here?

08:05.351 --> 08:06.249
We've got phaser weapons.

08:06.352 --> 08:07.751
I vote we blast it.

08:07.854 --> 08:10.254
I'll keep that in mind,
Mr. Bailey,

08:10.356 --> 08:12.153
when this becomes a democracy.

08:19.699 --> 08:23.567
Captain's Log,
star date 1513.8.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.364
Star maps reveal no indication

08:25.471 --> 08:27.268
of habitable planets nearby.

08:27.373 --> 08:29.705
Origin and purpose of the cube

08:29.809 --> 08:31.003
still unknown.

08:31.110 --> 08:34.510
We've been here,
held motionless, for 18 hours.

08:34.614 --> 08:35.910
Anything further, gentlemen?

08:36.015 --> 08:39.678
I believe it adds up
to either one of two possibilities.

08:41.888 --> 08:45.881
First, a space buoy
of some kind.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.118
Second?

08:49.095 --> 08:50.027
Flypaper.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.632
And you don't recommend
sticking around.

08:54.734 --> 08:55.632
Negative.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.636
It would make us
appear too weak.

08:59.906 --> 09:02.397
It's time for action,
gentlemen.

09:02.508 --> 09:03.440
Mr. Bailey--

09:03.543 --> 09:05.238
Bridge to Phaser Gun Crew--

09:05.344 --> 09:06.606
Countermand.

09:06.712 --> 09:07.906
I'll select what kind of action.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.345
I'm sorry, sir.
I thought--

09:09.448 --> 09:10.574
Are you explaining?

09:10.683 --> 09:12.310
I haven't requested
an explanation.

09:12.418 --> 09:15.216
Now, as I was about
to say, Navigator,

09:15.321 --> 09:17.414
plot a spiral course
away from the cube.

09:17.523 --> 09:18.615
Yes, sir.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.919
We'll try pulling away from it.

09:22.862 --> 09:23.954
Helmsman to Engine Room,

09:24.063 --> 09:24.961
stand by.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.463
All decks alert.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.466
We're going to try pulling away.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.809
Course plotted and laid in, sir.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.183
Engage, Mr. Sulu.

09:46.285 --> 09:47.479
Quarter speed.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.986
.25, sir.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.827
Still blocking us, sir.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.830
Let's see if it'll give way.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.229
Ahead half speed.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.495
.50, sir.

10:14.814 --> 10:16.372
[Beeping]

10:25.224 --> 10:28.284
Radiation from the short end
of the spectrum increasing.

10:28.394 --> 10:29.759
All stop. Hold position.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.540
It's still coming toward us.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.269
Range--190 meters.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.577
Radiation increasing.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.177
Power astern, half speed.

10:57.556 --> 10:58.454
Half speed.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.426
Radiation nearing
the tolerance level.

11:07.533 --> 11:08.431
Still coming.

11:08.534 --> 11:09.762
Gaining on us.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.427
Engines astern, full speed.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.198
Full speed.

11:30.556 --> 11:33.150
Range--125 meters now.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.265
Helm, give us warp speed.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.164
Warp one, sir.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.396
Radiation at
the tolerance level.

11:46.639 --> 11:47.628
Warp two, sir.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.606
Speed is now warp three.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.547
Radiation passing
the tolerance level,

11:58.651 --> 12:00.016
entering lethal zone.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.679
Range--51 meters
and still closing, sir.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.017
Phaser Crew stand ready.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.456
Phaser Crew
reports ready, sir.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.474
Growing. We can take
only a few more seconds.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.770
Lock phasers on target.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.804
Mr. Bailey, lock phasers!

12:29.915 --> 12:32.076
Phasers locked
on target, sir.

12:32.184 --> 12:34.584
At point-blank range
and closing.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.279
Fire main phasers.

12:56.142 --> 12:59.043
Captain's Log,
star date 1514.0.

12:59.145 --> 13:00.976
The cube has been
destroyed.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.105
Ship's damage--minor.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.115
But my next
decision--major.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.947
Probe on ahead
or turn back.

13:08.053 --> 13:09.042
Nothing, Captain.

13:09.155 --> 13:12.647
No contacts, no objects
in any direction.

13:12.758 --> 13:15.488
Care to speculate
on what we'll find

13:15.594 --> 13:17.323
if we go on ahead?

13:17.429 --> 13:18.987
Speculate?

13:19.098 --> 13:20.497
No.

13:22.101 --> 13:24.001
Logically, we'll discover
the intelligence

13:24.103 --> 13:26.003
which sent out the cube.

13:26.105 --> 13:28.505
Intelligence
different from ours

13:28.607 --> 13:30.575
or superior?

13:30.676 --> 13:31.870
Probably both.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.810
And if you're asking
the logical decision to make--

13:34.914 --> 13:36.404
No, I'm not.

13:36.515 --> 13:37.914
The mission of
the Enterprise

13:38.017 --> 13:40.451
is to seek out
and contact alien life.

13:42.855 --> 13:44.254
Has it occurred to you

13:44.356 --> 13:46.722
that there's
a certain...inefficiency

13:46.826 --> 13:48.726
in constantly
questioning me on things

13:48.828 --> 13:51.126
you've already made up
your mind about?

13:51.230 --> 13:53.790
It gives me
emotional security.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.770
Navigator,
set a course ahead.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.170
Plotted.

14:02.274 --> 14:03.605
Laid in, sir.

14:06.812 --> 14:07.710
Engage.

14:07.813 --> 14:08.973
Warp one, sir.

14:09.081 --> 14:09.877
Mr. Bailey--

14:09.982 --> 14:11.210
Phaser crews
were sluggish.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.148
You were slow
in locking them

14:13.252 --> 14:14.184
into your directional beam.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.344
Helmsman,

14:15.454 --> 14:17.945
engineering decks
could have been faster, too.

14:18.057 --> 14:19.957
Program a series
of simulated attacks

14:20.059 --> 14:21.219
and evasion maneuvers.

14:21.327 --> 14:22.726
Keep repeating
the exercise

14:22.828 --> 14:23.954
until we're proficient,
gentlemen.

14:24.063 --> 14:24.995
Yes, sir.

14:25.097 --> 14:26.086
Yes, sir.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.995
Your timing is lousy, Jim.

14:31.837 --> 14:33.236
Your men are tired.

14:33.339 --> 14:34.237
Captain's quarters.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.602
Don't you always say

14:35.708 --> 14:38.233
a little suffering
is good for the soul?

14:38.344 --> 14:39.242
I never say that.

14:39.345 --> 14:40.539
This is the bridge.

14:40.646 --> 14:41.738
Prepare for simulated attack.

14:41.847 --> 14:43.747
I'm especially
worried about Bailey.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.750
Navigator's position's
rough enough for a seasoned man.

14:46.852 --> 14:48.752
I think he'll cut it.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.253
Oh? How so sure?

14:50.356 --> 14:53.189
Because you spotted
something you liked in him,

14:53.292 --> 14:54.316
something familiar,

14:54.426 --> 14:56.826
Like yourself, say about,
oh, 11 years ago?

14:56.929 --> 14:58.328
On the double, deck five!

14:58.430 --> 14:59.954
Give me a green light.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.693
Why, Doctor, you've been
reading your textbooks again?

15:02.801 --> 15:04.200
I don't need textbooks

15:04.303 --> 15:06.703
to know you could've
promoted him too fast.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.204
Listen to that voice.

15:08.307 --> 15:09.706
Condition alert.
Battle stations.

15:22.021 --> 15:24.216
Engineering,
deck five, report.

15:24.323 --> 15:27.724
Phaser crews, come on,
let's get with it.

15:27.826 --> 15:30.727
Phaser station two,
where's your green light?

15:33.332 --> 15:34.230
What's next?

15:34.333 --> 15:36.233
''They're not machines, Jim''?

15:36.335 --> 15:37.233
Well, they're not.

15:37.336 --> 15:38.735
After what
they've been through--

15:38.837 --> 15:40.737
Dr. McCoy, I've heard you say

15:40.839 --> 15:43.740
that man is ultimately superior
to any mechanical device.

15:43.842 --> 15:45.742
No, I never
say that, either.

15:45.844 --> 15:48.745
I could've sworn
I heard you say that.

15:48.847 --> 15:49.745
[Communicator Signal]

15:51.717 --> 15:52.615
Kirk here.

15:52.718 --> 15:55.448
Exercise rating, Captain--94%.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.385
Let's try for 100, Mr. Spock.

15:57.489 --> 15:58.979
Agreed.

16:02.861 --> 16:05.955
What are you going
to do with that 6%?

16:06.065 --> 16:09.967
I'm going to take it,
and I'm going to--

16:10.069 --> 16:11.468
Excuse me, sir.

16:11.570 --> 16:14.471
It's past time you had
something to eat, sir.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.646
What the devil is this?

16:21.747 --> 16:23.374
Green leaves?

16:23.482 --> 16:24.608
It's dietary salad, sir.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.912
Dr. McCoy changed your diet card.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.179
I thought you knew.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.120
Your weight was up
a couple of pounds. Remember?

16:31.223 --> 16:34.784
Will you stop hovering
over me, Yeoman?

16:34.893 --> 16:36.861
I'll change it
if you don't like it.

16:36.962 --> 16:38.793
Bring some
for the doctor, too.

16:38.897 --> 16:42.333
No, no. I never eat
until the crew eats.

16:44.236 --> 16:45.464
Thank you, Yeoman.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.129
You're welcome, sir.

16:47.239 --> 16:48.467
[Bailey]
This is the bridge.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.804
All decks prepare
to better reaction time

16:50.909 --> 16:52.137
on second simulated attack.

16:52.244 --> 16:54.144
When I find the
headquarters genius

16:54.246 --> 16:56.180
that assigned me
a female yeoman--

16:56.281 --> 16:58.249
What's the matter,
don't you trust yourself?

16:58.350 --> 16:59.647
Battle stations.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.582
Engineering decks alert...

17:02.688 --> 17:05.088
I've already got
a female to worry about.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.156
Her name's the Enterprise.

17:06.258 --> 17:08.021
Engineering decks alert.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.560
Phaser crews, let's--

17:09.661 --> 17:10.593
[Sulu]
Countermand that.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.095
All decks to battle stations.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.165
This is not a drill.

17:14.266 --> 17:16.358
Repeat--this is not a drill.

17:16.468 --> 17:17.695
Kirk here.

17:17.803 --> 17:19.634
[Spock]
We're picking up an object, sir.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.637
Much larger, coming toward us.

17:21.740 --> 17:22.637
Coming.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.844
Exceptionally strong contact.

17:29.948 --> 17:31.279
Not visual yet.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.614
Distant spectrograph.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.660
Metallic, similar to cube.

17:42.761 --> 17:45.025
Much greater energy reading.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.058
There, sir.

17:56.041 --> 17:56.939
Half speed.

17:57.042 --> 17:58.441
Prepare for evasive action.

17:58.544 --> 18:00.444
Reducing to warp two, sir.

18:02.981 --> 18:04.380
Tractor beam, Captain.

18:04.483 --> 18:05.882
Something's grabbed us--hard.

18:05.984 --> 18:06.882
Engines overloading.

18:06.985 --> 18:07.883
All engines stop.

18:07.986 --> 18:08.884
All engines stopped, sir.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.221
Phaser crews stand ready.

18:13.325 --> 18:15.623
Bridge to phaser crews,
stand ready.

18:15.727 --> 18:17.888
Forward phaser, will comply.

18:17.996 --> 18:20.487
All weapons at operational ready.

18:43.522 --> 18:44.682
Fascinating.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.762
What's its mass, Mr. Spock?

18:51.864 --> 18:53.422
Reading goes off my scale.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.466
Must be a mile in diameter.

18:55.567 --> 18:56.966
Over 5,000 meters away,

18:57.069 --> 18:59.697
and it still fills the screen.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.703
Reduce image.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.637
Let me see all of it.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.376
Magnification 2.5, sir.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.210
Magnification 18.5, sir.

19:27.866 --> 19:29.265
Ship to ship.

19:29.368 --> 19:31.802
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.805
This is
the United Earth ship Enterprise.

19:34.907 --> 19:37.808
We convey greetings
and await your reply.

19:54.693 --> 19:55.625
What is it?

19:55.727 --> 19:57.354
A message...

19:57.462 --> 19:59.862
coming over my navigation beam.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.000
Pick it up.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.431
Switching, sir.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.936
...And trespassed
into our star systems.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.007
This is Balok,

20:09.107 --> 20:11.007
commander of
the flagship Fesarius

20:11.109 --> 20:13.100
of the First Federation.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.112
Your vessel,
obviously the product

20:15.214 --> 20:19.275
of a primitive
and savage civilization,

20:19.384 --> 20:21.784
having ignored
a warning buoy

20:21.887 --> 20:23.946
and having then destroyed it,

20:24.056 --> 20:29.460
has demonstrated your
intention is not peaceful.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.962
We are now considering
the disposition of your ship

20:33.065 --> 20:34.965
and the life aboard.

20:35.067 --> 20:35.965
Ship to ship.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.161
Hailing frequencies
open, sir.

20:38.270 --> 20:40.500
This is the captain
of the Enterprise speaking.

20:40.606 --> 20:43.973
The warning nature
of your space buoy was unknown to us.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.304
Our vessel was blocked.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.139
When we attempted to disengage--

20:47.246 --> 20:48.474
[Static]

20:52.084 --> 20:53.312
Captain, we're being invaded

20:53.418 --> 20:55.443
by exceptionally
strong sensor probes,

20:55.554 --> 20:56.486
everywhere--

20:56.588 --> 20:58.317
Our electrical systems,
our engines--

20:58.423 --> 21:01.221
No further communication
will be accepted.

21:01.326 --> 21:04.921
If there is the slightest
hostile move,

21:05.030 --> 21:07.931
your vessel will be
destroyed immediately.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.940
They're shutting off
some of our systems, Captain.

21:22.047 --> 21:23.446
Brilliant.

21:23.548 --> 21:25.948
Extremely sophisticated
in their methods.

21:26.051 --> 21:28.952
Does the recorder marker
have this on its tapes?

21:29.054 --> 21:30.453
Enough to warn
other Earth ships.

21:30.555 --> 21:32.318
Mr. Bailey, dispatch
recorder marker.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.461
Mr. Bailey.

21:42.567 --> 21:45.434
Uh, recorder marker
dispatched, sir.

21:45.537 --> 21:46.435
Marker on course.

21:46.538 --> 21:47.971
Heading back
the way we--

21:52.077 --> 21:55.638
Your recorder marker
has been destroyed.

21:55.747 --> 21:58.545
You have been examined.

21:58.650 --> 22:02.086
Your ship must be destroyed.

22:02.187 --> 22:06.624
We make assumption
you have a deity or deities

22:06.725 --> 22:10.217
or some such beliefs
which comfort you.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.422
We therefore grant you

22:12.531 --> 22:15.932
10 Earth time periods
known as minutes

22:16.034 --> 22:17.831
to make preparations.

22:21.573 --> 22:24.474
Might be interesting
to see what they look like

22:24.576 --> 22:27.477
if I can locate
where that voice is coming from.

22:39.891 --> 22:40.789
Balok's message--

22:40.892 --> 22:43.292
It was heard
all over the ship.

22:50.769 --> 22:52.168
Captain to crew.

22:52.270 --> 22:55.671
Those of you who have
served for long on this vessel

22:55.774 --> 22:57.298
have encountered
alien life-forms.

22:57.409 --> 23:00.310
You know the greatest danger
facing us is ourselves,

23:00.412 --> 23:02.744
an irrational fear
of the unknown.

23:02.848 --> 23:04.748
But there's no such thing
as the unknown--

23:04.850 --> 23:06.078
only things
temporarily hidden,

23:06.184 --> 23:07.208
temporarily not understood.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.685
In most cases
we have found

23:09.788 --> 23:12.313
that intelligence
capable of a civilization

23:12.424 --> 23:14.858
is capable of understanding
peaceful gestures.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.861
Surely a life-form
advanced enough for space travel

23:17.963 --> 23:19.260
is advanced enough

23:19.364 --> 23:21.264
to eventually
understand our motives.

23:21.366 --> 23:23.960
All decks stand by.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.195
Captain out.

23:26.304 --> 23:27.328
Ship to ship.

23:27.439 --> 23:29.270
Hailing frequencies
open, sir.

23:29.374 --> 23:32.935
This is the captain
of the U.S.S. Enterprise.

23:33.044 --> 23:34.341
We came seeking friendship.

23:34.446 --> 23:36.505
But we have no wish to trespass.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.242
To demonstrate our goodwill,

23:38.350 --> 23:41.683
our vessel will now
return the way it came.

23:41.787 --> 23:42.685
We--

23:42.788 --> 23:44.449
[High-pitched Sound]

23:54.399 --> 23:56.799
Lay in a course ahead,
Mr. Bailey.

23:56.902 --> 23:57.800
What?

23:59.070 --> 23:59.968
A course?

24:00.071 --> 24:01.902
Plotted and laid in, sir.

24:02.007 --> 24:03.565
Engage, warp factor one.

24:03.675 --> 24:04.573
Warp factor--

24:06.011 --> 24:07.410
There's no response.

24:09.014 --> 24:10.914
Switch to impulse.

24:11.016 --> 24:12.916
All engine systems show dead.

24:13.018 --> 24:14.144
And weapon systems.

24:14.252 --> 24:15.412
Switching to screen.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.613
I believe I can
get something visual.

24:44.549 --> 24:47.450
You are wasting time
and effort.

24:47.552 --> 24:50.953
There is no escape.

24:51.056 --> 24:55.459
You have
eight Earth minutes left.

25:03.201 --> 25:06.034
I was curious to see
how they appeared.

25:06.137 --> 25:08.935
Yes, of course you were.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.908
I don't understand this.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.911
Spock's wasting time.

25:15.013 --> 25:18.176
Everybody else
just sitting around.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.410
Somebody's got
to do something.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.417
Easy, Bailey.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.421
What do they want?
Let's find out.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.423
They want us
to lose our heads.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.425
We've only got
eight minutes left.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.926
7 minutes
and 45 seconds.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.427
He's doing a countdown!

25:31.530 --> 25:32.929
Practically end of watch.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.931
Are you all
out of your minds?

25:35.033 --> 25:36.432
End of watch?

25:36.535 --> 25:37.934
It's the end of everything.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.436
What are you, robots?
Wound-up toy soldiers?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.063
Don't you know
when you're dying?

25:42.173 --> 25:43.936
Watch and regulations
and orders--

25:44.042 --> 25:44.940
What do they mean?

25:45.043 --> 25:46.237
Bailey, you're relieved!

25:48.713 --> 25:50.340
Escort him
to his quarters, Doctor.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.452
Let's go.

26:12.504 --> 26:13.903
Ship to ship.

26:14.005 --> 26:15.563
Hailing frequencies
open, sir.

26:17.375 --> 26:20.401
This is the captain
of the Enterprise speaking.

26:20.512 --> 26:22.912
It is the custom
of Earth people

26:23.014 --> 26:24.914
to try and avoid
misunderstanding

26:25.016 --> 26:25.846
whenever possible.

26:25.951 --> 26:27.418
We destroyed your space buoy

26:27.519 --> 26:29.578
as a simple act
of self-preservation.

26:29.688 --> 26:31.918
When we attempted
to move away from it,

26:32.023 --> 26:35.459
it emitted radiation
harmful to our species.

26:35.560 --> 26:38.927
If you've examined
our ship and its tapes,

26:39.030 --> 26:41.294
you know this to be true.

26:41.399 --> 26:43.526
[Electronic Humming]

26:50.375 --> 26:54.072
You now have
seven minutes left.

27:10.862 --> 27:12.386
4 minutes, 30 seconds.

27:12.497 --> 27:14.897
You have
an annoying fascination

27:15.000 --> 27:18.595
for timepieces,
Mr. Sulu.

27:26.811 --> 27:27.903
Jim...

27:30.015 --> 27:31.915
Four minutes.

27:34.019 --> 27:36.920
What's the matter
with them out there?

27:37.022 --> 27:39.923
They must know
we mean them no harm.

27:40.025 --> 27:41.925
They're certainly
aware by now

27:42.027 --> 27:44.928
that we're totally
incapable of it.

27:45.030 --> 27:47.931
There must be
something to do,

27:48.033 --> 27:49.933
something
I've overlooked.

27:51.269 --> 27:52.930
In chess,

27:53.038 --> 27:55.939
when one is outmatched,
the game is over.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.442
Checkmate.

28:00.545 --> 28:02.376
Is that your
best recommendation?

28:03.982 --> 28:05.882
I'm sor--

28:07.986 --> 28:11.888
I regret that I can find
no other logical alternative.

28:21.499 --> 28:24.400
Assuming we get out
of this, Captain--

28:24.502 --> 28:25.901
Nobody's given up yet.

28:29.507 --> 28:30.906
Well, then about Bailey.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.409
Let me enter it
in my medical records

28:33.511 --> 28:34.409
as simple fatigue.

28:34.512 --> 28:35.410
That's my decision,
Doctor.

28:35.513 --> 28:36.411
And your mistake.

28:36.514 --> 28:37.913
You overworked him,
pushed him,

28:38.016 --> 28:39.415
expected too much
from him--

28:39.517 --> 28:40.916
I'm ordering you
to drop it.

28:41.019 --> 28:43.180
I have no time for you,
your theories,

28:43.288 --> 28:44.414
your quaint
philosophies...

28:44.522 --> 28:47.423
I intend to challenge
your actions in my records.

28:47.525 --> 28:49.425
I'll state
that I warned you.

28:49.527 --> 28:50.425
That's no bluff.

28:50.528 --> 28:54.191
Any time you can
bluff me, Doctor--

28:56.301 --> 28:58.428
Three minutes.

29:03.975 --> 29:05.374
All right, Doctor.

29:05.477 --> 29:08.878
Let's hope we have time
to argue about it.

29:21.993 --> 29:23.893
Not chess, Mr. Spock.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.330
Poker.

29:31.002 --> 29:32.629
Do you know the game?

29:35.507 --> 29:36.906
Ship to ship.

29:37.008 --> 29:38.908
Hailing frequencies
open, sir.

29:42.514 --> 29:45.415
This is the captain
of the Enterprise.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.917
Our respect
for other life-forms

29:48.019 --> 29:50.783
requires that we give you
this warning.

29:50.889 --> 29:53.414
One critical item
of information

29:53.525 --> 29:55.425
that has never been
incorporated

29:55.527 --> 29:58.223
into the memory banks
of any Earth ship.

29:58.329 --> 30:00.923
Since the early years
of space exploration,

30:01.032 --> 30:03.933
Earth vessels have had
incorporated into them

30:04.035 --> 30:06.435
a substance known as...

30:06.538 --> 30:07.470
corbomite.

30:07.572 --> 30:09.938
It is a material
and a device

30:10.041 --> 30:13.272
which prevents attack on us.

30:13.378 --> 30:16.472
If any destructive energy
touches our vessel,

30:16.581 --> 30:18.947
a reverse reaction
of equal strength

30:19.050 --> 30:20.813
is created, destroying--

30:20.919 --> 30:23.945
You now have two minutes.

30:24.055 --> 30:26.455
Destroying the attacker!

30:28.560 --> 30:30.460
It may interest you to know

30:30.562 --> 30:32.962
that since the initial use
of corbomite

30:33.064 --> 30:35.658
more than two
of our centuries ago,

30:35.767 --> 30:40.261
no attacking vessel
has survived the attempt.

30:40.371 --> 30:43.966
Death has little meaning to us.

30:44.075 --> 30:46.976
If it has none to you...

30:47.078 --> 30:49.137
then attack us now.

30:50.415 --> 30:53.043
We grow annoyed
at your foolishness.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.938
However, it was well played.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.944
I regret not having learned
more about this Balok.

31:22.046 --> 31:24.241
He was reminiscent
of my father.

31:24.349 --> 31:26.180
May heaven have
helped your mother.

31:26.284 --> 31:27.945
Quite the contrary.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.952
She considered herself

31:30.054 --> 31:33.182
a very fortunate Earth woman.

31:38.563 --> 31:39.461
Doc...

31:40.865 --> 31:41.957
Sorry.

31:42.066 --> 31:44.967
For having other things
on your mind? My fault.

31:45.069 --> 31:49.165
I don't how you keep
from punching me in the face.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.309
One minute.

31:55.847 --> 31:57.178
I knew he would.

32:20.505 --> 32:23.941
If anyone's interested...

32:24.042 --> 32:25.304
30 seconds.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.537
Request permission
to return to post, sir.

32:34.052 --> 32:35.349
Permission granted.

32:50.001 --> 32:50.899
11...

32:52.070 --> 32:53.230
10 seconds.

32:53.338 --> 32:54.464
9...

32:54.572 --> 32:55.561
8...

32:55.673 --> 32:56.970
7...

32:57.075 --> 32:58.167
6...

32:58.276 --> 32:59.743
5...

32:59.844 --> 33:01.402
4...

33:01.512 --> 33:02.945
3...

33:03.047 --> 33:04.446
2...

33:04.549 --> 33:05.447
1.

33:41.552 --> 33:45.545
A very interesting game,
this poker.

33:45.656 --> 33:49.285
It does have advantages
over chess.

33:49.394 --> 33:51.453
Love to teach it to you.

33:52.897 --> 33:55.457
This is the commander
of the Fesarius.

33:55.566 --> 33:57.966
Here it comes.
Is it raise or call?

33:58.069 --> 34:00.299
The destruction
of your vessel

34:00.405 --> 34:02.930
has been delayed.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.805
We will relent
in your destruction

34:05.910 --> 34:09.902
only if we have proof
of your corbomite device.

34:10.014 --> 34:11.413
Hold on that.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.916
Let him sweat for a change.

34:23.527 --> 34:24.927
Ship to ship.

34:25.029 --> 34:26.428
Hailing frequencies, sir.

34:26.531 --> 34:27.929
Request denied.

34:29.699 --> 34:31.690
I have visual contact, Captain.

34:48.820 --> 34:51.447
We will soon inform you

34:51.556 --> 34:55.117
of our decision
regarding your vessel.

34:55.226 --> 34:58.957
And having permitted
your primitive efforts

34:59.063 --> 35:00.462
to see my form,

35:00.565 --> 35:05.229
I trust it has pleased
your curiosity.

35:05.336 --> 35:06.667
And now,

35:06.771 --> 35:11.037
another demonstration
of our superiority.

35:22.787 --> 35:26.188
I thought the power
was off in the galley.

35:26.290 --> 35:29.987
I used a hand phaser,
and zap--hot coffee.

35:34.999 --> 35:36.159
Something's going on, Captain.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.705
It's a small ship.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.302
About 2,000 metric tons.

35:51.115 --> 35:52.707
It has been decided

35:52.817 --> 35:55.718
that I will conduct you
to a planet

35:55.820 --> 35:57.720
of the First Federation

35:57.822 --> 36:00.222
which is capable of sustaining

36:00.324 --> 36:02.224
your life-form.

36:02.326 --> 36:05.659
There you will disembark
and be interned.

36:05.763 --> 36:08.288
Your ship will be
destroyed, of course.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.060
Engine systems
coming on, Captain.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.157
Do not be deceived

36:11.269 --> 36:13.760
by the size of this pilot vessel.

36:13.871 --> 36:17.807
It has an equal potential
to destroy your vessel.

36:19.477 --> 36:20.637
Tractor beam again.

36:20.745 --> 36:22.178
So that you may sustain

36:22.280 --> 36:24.748
your gravity and atmosphere,

36:24.849 --> 36:27.511
your systems are now open.

36:27.618 --> 36:29.677
Escape is impossible

36:29.787 --> 36:32.688
since you are being taken
under our power

36:32.790 --> 36:34.382
to your destination.

36:34.492 --> 36:38.053
Any move to escape
or destroy this ship

36:38.162 --> 36:41.620
will result in
the instant destruction

36:41.732 --> 36:44.428
of the Enterprise
and everyone aboard.

36:46.304 --> 36:47.771
We're being towed, sir.

37:41.292 --> 37:43.760
Captain's Log,
star date 1514.1.

37:43.861 --> 37:46.694
The Enterprise is in tow.

37:46.797 --> 37:48.196
To this point,

37:48.299 --> 37:50.199
no resistance has been offered.

37:50.301 --> 37:51.700
My plan?

37:51.802 --> 37:52.928
A show of resignation.

37:53.037 --> 37:55.062
Balok's tractor beam has to be

37:55.172 --> 37:57.436
a heavy drain of power
on his small ship.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.907
Question--
Will he grow careless?

38:00.011 --> 38:03.003
He's pulling out
a little ahead of us.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.514
He's sneaked power
down a bit.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.021
Our speed is down
to .64 of light.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.522
I want a right angle course.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.023
Shear away from him

38:15.126 --> 38:17.026
no matter which way he turns.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.528
Maximum acceleration
when I give the word.

38:19.630 --> 38:20.528
Yes, sir.

38:42.486 --> 38:43.384
Engage.

39:17.588 --> 39:19.522
It's a strain, Captain.

39:19.623 --> 39:21.250
Engines are overloading.

39:22.626 --> 39:23.558
More power.

39:23.661 --> 39:25.526
We're superheating.

39:25.629 --> 39:29.030
Intermix temperature,
7,400 degrees.

39:30.134 --> 39:31.032
75...

39:32.636 --> 39:33.534
76...

39:36.640 --> 39:38.198
8,000 degrees.

40:52.983 --> 40:54.575
Shear away, Mr. Bailey.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.304
2,000 degrees above maximum.

41:18.409 --> 41:19.535
84...

41:21.145 --> 41:22.305
85...

41:23.547 --> 41:24.445
86...

41:25.549 --> 41:27.141
She'll blow soon!

41:27.251 --> 41:29.583
Now, Mr. Sulu.
Impulse power two.

41:51.742 --> 41:53.300
We're breaking free, sir.

42:04.121 --> 42:05.520
All engines stop.

42:07.124 --> 42:08.751
All engines stopped, sir.

42:10.127 --> 42:11.526
Engines need work badly, Captain.

42:11.629 --> 42:13.529
Can you hold it here
a few hours?

42:13.631 --> 42:15.030
That may not be wise.

42:15.132 --> 42:17.032
He signaled
to the mother ship.

42:17.134 --> 42:19.034
Then we're not home yet.

42:21.639 --> 42:23.038
A signal, Captain.

42:23.140 --> 42:24.539
It's very weak.

42:24.642 --> 42:26.371
It's Balok.

42:26.477 --> 42:29.537
It's a distress signal
to the Fesarius.

42:29.647 --> 42:32.548
His engines...are out...

42:32.650 --> 42:35.050
His life-sustaining system

42:35.152 --> 42:36.312
isn't operating.

42:36.420 --> 42:38.320
The message
is repeating, sir.

42:38.422 --> 42:39.286
Any reply?

42:39.423 --> 42:41.323
Negative. His signal
is growing weak.

42:41.425 --> 42:44.656
Sir, I doubt
the mother ship heard it.

42:44.762 --> 42:47.560
Plot a course for it,
Mr. Bailey.

42:48.966 --> 42:50.558
For it, Captain?

42:50.668 --> 42:51.965
Dead ahead.

43:02.179 --> 43:04.010
This is
the captain speaking.

43:04.114 --> 43:06.514
First Federation vessel
is in distress.

43:06.617 --> 43:08.016
We're preparing to board it.

43:08.118 --> 43:10.018
There are lives at stake--

43:10.120 --> 43:12.020
by our standards,
alien life--

43:12.122 --> 43:14.022
but lives nevertheless.

43:14.124 --> 43:15.022
Captain out.

43:15.125 --> 43:17.855
Course plotted
and laid in, sir.

43:17.962 --> 43:19.930
Mr. Scott, ready
the transporter room.

43:20.030 --> 43:21.361
Aye, sir.

43:21.465 --> 43:23.729
Mr. Sulu, bring us
to within 100 meters.

43:23.834 --> 43:24.732
Ahead slow.

43:26.136 --> 43:27.535
Ahead slow, sir.

43:31.141 --> 43:32.540
Jim, don't you think--

43:32.643 --> 43:35.043
What's the mission
of this vessel, Doctor?

43:35.145 --> 43:38.046
To seek out
and contact alien life

43:38.148 --> 43:40.048
and an opportunity
to demonstrate

43:40.150 --> 43:42.618
what our high-sounding words mean.

43:42.720 --> 43:44.551
Any questions?

43:44.655 --> 43:46.555
I'll take two men
with me--

43:46.657 --> 43:50.058
Dr. McCoy to examine
and treat the aliens if necessary,

43:50.160 --> 43:51.684
and you, Mr. Bailey.

43:55.366 --> 43:57.095
Sir?

43:57.201 --> 43:58.896
The face of the unknown.

43:59.003 --> 44:02.996
I think I owe you
a look at it.

44:03.107 --> 44:04.904
Yes, sir.

44:06.577 --> 44:07.771
Captain,
request permission to--

44:07.878 --> 44:09.277
Denied. If I'm wrong,

44:09.380 --> 44:12.281
if it's a trap,
I want you here.

44:26.897 --> 44:27.795
Transporter ready?

44:27.898 --> 44:29.798
Well, yes, sir,
but it's risky.

44:29.900 --> 44:32.300
We're locked into
their main deck.

44:32.403 --> 44:33.370
Air sample?

44:33.470 --> 44:34.801
Breathable. In fact,

44:34.905 --> 44:37.806
a slightly higher
oxygen content than our own.

44:37.908 --> 44:39.034
Communicator...

44:40.411 --> 44:41.309
phaser weapon.

44:41.412 --> 44:43.312
Thank you, Scotty.
Ready, Doctor?

44:43.414 --> 44:46.315
No, but you won't
let that stop you.

44:48.519 --> 44:49.816
Bend low, gentlemen.

44:49.920 --> 44:52.354
It reads pretty cramped
over there.

44:55.826 --> 44:57.088
Ready to transport.

44:57.194 --> 44:58.320
Energize.

45:34.898 --> 45:37.298
It's a...dummy.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.301
A puppet of some kind.

45:39.403 --> 45:40.802
I'm Balok.

45:40.904 --> 45:42.303
Welcome aboard.

46:03.861 --> 46:05.260
I'm Captain Kirk.

46:05.362 --> 46:07.762
And McCoy and Bailey.

46:07.865 --> 46:08.763
Sit.

46:08.866 --> 46:10.458
Be comfortable.

46:13.871 --> 46:15.270
Go ahead.

46:15.372 --> 46:16.771
Be seated.

46:25.382 --> 46:26.781
We must drink.

46:26.884 --> 46:28.784
This is tranya.

46:28.886 --> 46:32.447
I hope you relish it
as much as I.

46:39.930 --> 46:41.295
Commander Balok...

46:41.398 --> 46:43.298
I know, I know.

46:43.400 --> 46:45.800
A thousand questions.

46:45.903 --> 46:49.168
But first, the tranya.

46:59.650 --> 47:00.810
Gentlemen.

47:05.789 --> 47:06.983
Ahh...

47:19.503 --> 47:21.767
Commander, that puppet...

47:21.872 --> 47:24.204
My alter ego, so to speak.

47:24.308 --> 47:25.775
In your culture,

47:25.876 --> 47:29.277
he would be Mr. Hyde
to my Jekyll.

47:29.379 --> 47:31.279
You must admit
he's effective.

47:31.381 --> 47:34.214
You would never have been
frightened by me.

47:34.318 --> 47:36.786
And I thought
my distress signal

47:36.887 --> 47:38.218
quite clever.

47:38.322 --> 47:40.722
It was a pleasure
testing you.

47:40.824 --> 47:42.382
Testing us?

47:42.492 --> 47:44.221
I see.

47:44.328 --> 47:47.559
I had to discover
your real intentions.

47:47.664 --> 47:49.131
But you probed
our memory banks.

47:49.233 --> 47:50.791
Your records
could have been

47:50.901 --> 47:52.596
a deception on your part.

47:52.703 --> 47:53.692
And your crew?

47:57.908 --> 48:00.342
I have no crew, Doctor.

48:00.444 --> 48:01.877
I run everything,

48:01.979 --> 48:05.380
this entire complex,
from this small ship.

48:05.482 --> 48:07.416
But I miss company.

48:07.517 --> 48:09.382
Conversation.

48:09.486 --> 48:12.114
Even an alien
would be welcome.

48:12.222 --> 48:14.952
Perhaps one of your men

48:15.058 --> 48:17.151
for some period of time.

48:17.261 --> 48:20.890
An exchange
of information, cultures.

48:20.998 --> 48:23.762
Yes. Both our cultures
would benefit.

48:27.304 --> 48:31.764
Do you know where we can
find a volunteer, Mr. Bailey?

48:31.875 --> 48:33.672
Me, sir.
I'd like to volunteer.

48:33.777 --> 48:35.267
Ah.

48:35.379 --> 48:37.813
You represent
Earth's best, then.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.280
No, sir, I'm not.

48:39.383 --> 48:41.010
I'll make
plenty of mistakes.

48:41.118 --> 48:43.780
But you'd find out
more about us that way,

48:43.887 --> 48:46.788
and I'd get
a better officer in return.

48:50.060 --> 48:52.290
I see.

48:52.396 --> 48:54.796
We think much alike,
Captain,

48:54.898 --> 48:56.297
You and l.

48:58.902 --> 49:01.803
Now, before I bring back
the Fesarius,

49:01.905 --> 49:04.237
let me show you my vessel.

49:04.341 --> 49:07.242
It is not often
I have this pleasure.

49:10.347 --> 49:13.248
Yes, we're very much
alike, Captain.

49:13.350 --> 49:15.750
Both proud of our ships.

49:16.305 --> 49:22.300
