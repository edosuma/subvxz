00:49.801 --> 00:50.969
Moonee!

00:52.220 --> 00:53.388
Scooty!

00:53.972 --> 00:55.557
What?

00:55.724 --> 00:56.808
Moonee!

00:59.686 --> 01:00.937
Scooty!

01:01.563 --> 01:03.857
What?

01:04.107 --> 01:06.025
Moonee!

01:08.445 --> 01:10.405
Scooty!

01:10.488 --> 01:14.868
What?

01:16.369 --> 01:17.787
Freshies at the Future!

02:30.360 --> 02:33.488
- Scooty, wait up!
- No, guys, this way. Come on.

02:43.623 --> 02:45.834
That one over there. The blue one.

02:58.596 --> 03:00.181
I can get it farther than you, Moonee.

03:00.265 --> 03:01.850
Yeah, right.

03:07.939 --> 03:09.732
I got two points ahead of you, Moonee.

03:09.983 --> 03:12.277
- I got...
- No. I got 100 points.

03:12.485 --> 03:13.695
That's not possible.

03:16.531 --> 03:18.783
Bet you...

03:19.909 --> 03:22.036
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna get the front.

03:25.248 --> 03:26.833
- Ooh!
- I got the windshield.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.209
I got the top.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.630
What the fuck is... What?

03:33.172 --> 03:34.172
Hey!

03:34.424 --> 03:36.175
Stop that!

03:36.801 --> 03:38.177
Come on. Are you kidding me, guys?

03:38.261 --> 03:40.889
- Go home, ratchet bitch!
- That's my car!

03:40.972 --> 03:42.307
- Hey!
- Go on, shit! Shit!

03:42.682 --> 03:44.225
You are shit!

03:45.727 --> 03:47.896
Get your ass down here right now
and clean it up.

03:47.979 --> 03:49.689
Shit! Shit! Shit!

03:49.772 --> 03:53.985
I'm not playing with you. Get your fucking
ass down here right now and clean it up.

03:54.861 --> 03:57.572
- Clean this shit up right now.
- You're not the boss of me!

03:57.655 --> 03:58.781
Where your parents at?

03:59.657 --> 04:00.700
Hey! Hey!

04:00.783 --> 04:02.702
Oh.

04:03.077 --> 04:07.290
- He spit on me.
- It wasn't him. It was me, stupid thot!

04:07.373 --> 04:08.976
I'm gonna go up there
and tell your parents.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.419
Try it, biotch. I don't live here!

04:11.502 --> 04:12.754
Ratchet!

04:12.837 --> 04:15.423
- Hey!
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

04:15.506 --> 04:16.548
Hey!

04:19.344 --> 04:21.178
Stay right there. Hey!

04:21.262 --> 04:22.472
Go, go, go, go.

04:23.348 --> 04:26.017
- Moonee.
- Hey! Get over here!

04:26.684 --> 04:28.770
Come clean this shit up right now.

04:28.853 --> 04:29.854
Dicky!

04:31.356 --> 04:33.107
Get your ass upstairs right now.

04:33.399 --> 04:35.360
- Dad!
- Now!

04:36.277 --> 04:38.029
Hey! Is that your kid?

04:38.571 --> 04:40.891
- Him and his friends just spit on my car.
- Get over here.

04:46.996 --> 04:49.123
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.547
Yeah. Yeah.

04:56.631 --> 04:58.216
Yeah.

04:59.801 --> 05:02.595
Mmm, yeah. Mmm, yeah. Mmm, yeah.

05:14.482 --> 05:15.482
Thanks.

05:19.946 --> 05:20.947
Whoo!

05:27.328 --> 05:28.579
Hey, hey, hey.

05:28.788 --> 05:29.998
Take your shoes off.

05:30.623 --> 05:32.333
- Both of you.
- Hey, where's the Slinky?

05:32.417 --> 05:33.501
Got it.

05:33.584 --> 05:35.211
Here... Like this.

05:38.756 --> 05:41.676
- I wanna speak to the manager right now.
- May I help you with something?

05:41.759 --> 05:42.760
Are you the manager?

05:45.638 --> 05:47.056
- Yeah?
- Coming!

05:52.061 --> 05:54.063
- Yeah?
- Gotta talk to your mom.

05:55.606 --> 05:58.359
- Moonee, who was that?
- Nobody.

06:01.988 --> 06:04.949
- Shit, Moonee. What did you two do?
- Nothing.

06:05.950 --> 06:08.036
Yeah?

06:08.119 --> 06:10.079
Halley, this woman's from next door,

06:10.163 --> 06:12.790
and she said Moonee
did something to her car.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.333
You in 322?

06:14.417 --> 06:15.918
No, FutureLand.

06:16.002 --> 06:16.919
- Oh.
- Okay.

06:17.003 --> 06:20.423
Her and her friend Scoot
spit all over my kid and my car.

06:20.506 --> 06:23.801
- It's Scooty!
- It's Scooty, not Scoot.

06:24.177 --> 06:25.678
You saw them do this?

06:25.928 --> 06:26.928
Yes, I did.

06:26.971 --> 06:29.616
And their friend's father told me
that they're always pulling this shit.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.683
That's not true.

06:30.767 --> 06:31.601
Which friend?

06:31.684 --> 06:34.604
Whatever. They spit on my car,
and they spit on my kid.

06:34.687 --> 06:36.355
Okay. Okay. Okay.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.484
Halley... One, sort this out.

06:39.901 --> 06:43.029
Two, you smoke in the room again,
you're out of here.

06:43.112 --> 06:44.822
- I'm not smoking.
- Bye, Bobby.

06:44.906 --> 06:47.450
- Last warning, Halley.
- Yeah, well, I'm not.

06:48.326 --> 06:49.327
Asshole.

06:49.911 --> 06:52.413
Come on, you two.
Go get some paper towels.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.084
- Whoa.
- Bertha!

06:56.542 --> 06:59.962
We need paper towels!
We need paper towels!

07:06.636 --> 07:07.636
Okay.

07:18.940 --> 07:20.024
These two yours?

07:20.483 --> 07:22.401
These? No. They're not mine.

07:23.945 --> 07:25.363
Well, they're mine now.

07:26.656 --> 07:29.242
My daughter made me a grandmother
when she was 15.

07:30.118 --> 07:34.330
So I'm just taking care of them until
she stops acting like her stupid father.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.210
When'd you move in, Grandma?

07:39.919 --> 07:41.838
That's my goober. My goober!

07:44.423 --> 07:46.342
Oh, my God!

07:47.802 --> 07:48.970
You got another one of those?

07:58.521 --> 08:02.066
- Hey, girl!
- Hey!

08:02.150 --> 08:04.193
- You had another one?
- Yeah.

08:04.652 --> 08:05.945
When was this?

08:06.237 --> 08:08.030
- Stop!
- Hey. Hey, guys.

08:08.114 --> 08:10.658
You're having too much fun,
and it's not supposed to be fun.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.160
It's supposed to be work, okay?

08:12.243 --> 08:14.203
- It's summer, let them have fun.
- Get on it.

08:14.287 --> 08:15.927
- No worries.
- Let them have a good time.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.958
- It's summer, what do you want?
- I think it was very disrespectful.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.710
Very disrespectful.

08:20.793 --> 08:21.836
This is not okay.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.021
Clearly we have different
versions of disrespectful.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.672
- What's your name?
- Jancey.

08:24.755 --> 08:28.134
Jancey? What kind of name is Jancey?

08:28.217 --> 08:30.636
Hey, Jancey.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.265
It would be a whole lot easier
if someone were to help us.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.743
- They're doing you a favor.
- I am ashamed for you right now.

08:36.767 --> 08:37.894
Are you serious?

08:38.102 --> 08:39.812
- Doing me a favor.
- Okay, well...

08:39.895 --> 08:41.981
It didn't need that kind of car wash.

08:42.063 --> 08:45.026
Hey, hey.
Jancey, honey, what are you doing?

08:45.109 --> 08:47.361
- I'm cleaning up!
- Yeah!

08:47.445 --> 08:50.615
Jance, let them clean it up by themselves,
okay? That's not your job.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.618
No. They ask-ed me to, so I'm gonna do it.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.204
- No, I don't want you doing that. Okay?
- Let her help.

08:56.287 --> 08:59.332
We should clean the inside, too.
It's a mess.

08:59.415 --> 09:02.293
You think they're gonna get along
if they're not gonna, like, socialize?

09:02.376 --> 09:04.837
- That's what they do here.
- Yeah. Social kids, like you.

09:04.921 --> 09:07.340
Yep, like me.
What are you trying to say, lady?

09:07.423 --> 09:09.634
I'll spark you up,
'cause you seem stressed.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.135
I will help you out.

09:11.219 --> 09:12.845
Maybe that's what I need.

09:12.929 --> 09:16.974
I need to lighten up, I need to light up,
and I need to get laid.

09:18.184 --> 09:20.186
Same here, girl. I feel you.

09:20.895 --> 09:22.939
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

09:23.022 --> 09:24.690
- My turn.
- Okay.

09:24.774 --> 09:26.317
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

10:01.978 --> 10:02.978
Yo!

10:19.078 --> 10:20.621
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, mama.

10:20.705 --> 10:21.831
Hi, Miss Ashley.

10:22.331 --> 10:23.332
Here you go.

10:23.416 --> 10:24.416
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

10:24.709 --> 10:28.921
Hey, yo, my mom wants to know
if you want to go to OBT tonight.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.756
- It's Saturday, right?
- Yeah.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.049
Okay, then, we're gonna go.

10:32.591 --> 10:33.591
Bye, guys.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.112
- Bye.
- Go have fun. Be careful, okay?

10:35.136 --> 10:36.345
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.349
No maple syrup.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.727
- She didn't pack any for you?
- No.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.814
My mom makes mistakes all the time.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.567
Well, you need to let her know
we like the maple syrup.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.028
I always tell her, and then she forgets.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.198
Oh, look!

11:03.164 --> 11:06.584
- Middle finger!
- You're a wild animal.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.300
Hey.

11:14.383 --> 11:15.968
Hey, guys!

11:16.052 --> 11:18.387
- Hey, girl!
- Thank you so much!

11:18.471 --> 11:20.973
No problem. Of course, of course.

11:21.057 --> 11:22.409
- Let me know if they misbehave.
- Of course.

11:22.433 --> 11:24.935
Guys, behave, okay? Seriously.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.438
<i>- How you been?
- I've been good.</i>

11:27.521 --> 11:29.732
I've been good. Working, you know.

11:29.815 --> 11:32.151
Taking care of the baby. You already know.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.069
- Hi, babe!
- Hi!

11:33.152 --> 11:33.986
So good to see you.

11:34.070 --> 11:37.114
Hey!

11:40.868 --> 11:42.036
Hey!

11:42.328 --> 11:43.996
What's popping, Don?

11:56.592 --> 12:00.429
- They fucking chose Simone.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

12:01.222 --> 12:04.850
I know, right? I've been there way longer
than that bitch. I can't even believe it.

12:06.602 --> 12:07.686
Fuck that!

12:07.895 --> 12:12.399
The second that I'm manager,
you're totally hired, Ma. I got you.

12:13.818 --> 12:17.238
Don't be tight. Let's just have
a good night. Let's have a good night.

12:19.490 --> 12:20.658
Smile!

12:21.617 --> 12:24.703
Most of those ratchet-ass bitches
were doing extras, you know?

12:24.954 --> 12:25.996
In the backroom?

12:26.455 --> 12:27.957
I'm not doing extras.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.918
I'm dancing for tips. That's what I do.
I said no.

12:31.544 --> 12:34.296
Two days later, with no warning,
Hector fires me.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.882
After not letting me up on stage
all fucking night.

12:37.258 --> 12:39.098
- Halley, I'm sorry, but...
- Fucking bullshit.

12:39.260 --> 12:42.054
Okay. I'm sorry to say
that's gonna affect your TANF.

12:42.138 --> 12:43.639
No shit. That's why I'm here.

12:44.265 --> 12:47.268
Okay, Halley. Please make
a concerted effort to put in 30 hours.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.812
Ha! You find me 30 hours.

12:49.895 --> 12:53.065
I have applications in at every shithole
up and down the strip.

12:53.149 --> 12:54.859
And the parks ain't gonna hire me.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.819
Okay. So can you please
control your language

12:56.902 --> 12:58.421
in front of her and everyone else in here?

12:58.445 --> 13:01.049
Can you just give me some bus passes?
Why did I even come out here?

13:01.073 --> 13:02.575
Halley, please. I'm trying to...

13:18.215 --> 13:21.385
Hi. Could Dicky come out and play?

13:21.468 --> 13:23.971
After what you guys pulled,
he's punished for a week.

13:27.725 --> 13:30.311
- Where are we going?
- Just come on.

13:36.942 --> 13:39.278
Like, lady, open it!

13:40.321 --> 13:41.405
Hello there.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.488
What?

13:42.656 --> 13:44.074
Could Jancey come out and play?

13:44.575 --> 13:46.845
What, you're gonna take her
to spit on someone else's car?

13:46.869 --> 13:48.871
No. We're just playing.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.331
Yeah. Just playing.

13:51.081 --> 13:54.043
- What are you playing?
- We're just playing!

13:54.126 --> 13:55.044
Okay, what are you playing?

13:55.127 --> 13:57.167
You didn't answer my question.
What are you playing?

13:58.672 --> 14:02.843
- Relax, your daughter is safe in my hands.
- And my hands, too.

14:05.054 --> 14:08.474
Jance? Do you wanna go play
with the kids from the purple place?

14:11.477 --> 14:12.477
I wanna play.

14:12.770 --> 14:14.438
I wanna play, too.

14:19.068 --> 14:20.068
Whoa!

14:30.079 --> 14:31.997
Hey, guys, don't you live over here?

14:32.957 --> 14:35.542
Yeah but, we have more things
to show you.

14:35.626 --> 14:36.626
Come on!

14:38.963 --> 14:41.173
I don't... I don't love oranges.

14:41.257 --> 14:43.259
I don't love oranges.

14:43.968 --> 14:46.553
I... I love orange soda.

14:47.763 --> 14:48.764
We squoosh...

14:52.309 --> 14:57.231
But the only thing
I don't like about oranges is the lid.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.358
- You mean the peel?
- The lid.

14:59.441 --> 15:01.151
Yeah, that's called a peel.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.032
Don't you think
we're going too far?

15:07.908 --> 15:11.996
No. Just come on.
Don't be a... Don't be a loser.

15:12.663 --> 15:15.499
Don't call me that. But, okay!

15:18.335 --> 15:21.130
And this is where we get free ice cream.

15:21.505 --> 15:22.881
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.008
Follow me.

15:25.134 --> 15:27.177
- Could we have some money?
- Some change?

15:28.095 --> 15:30.597
- Do we have enough?
- I'm counting.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.272
Let's go.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.778
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, miss.

15:44.862 --> 15:48.073
Could you give us some change, please?
We need to buy ice cream.

15:48.282 --> 15:51.368
'Cause we don't have any money.
We just have five cents.

15:51.452 --> 15:54.955
- Yeah. We just have five cents.
- And the doctor said we have asthma,

15:55.039 --> 15:57.082
- and we gotta eat ice cream right away.
- Yeah.

15:57.166 --> 15:59.043
- Yeah, my doctor too.
- Ice cream.

15:59.418 --> 16:00.294
Guys.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.296
- We're not lying.
- It's fine.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.673
- Thank you very much!
- Here you go.

16:04.882 --> 16:05.883
- Come on.
- Let's go.

16:05.966 --> 16:06.966
Come on!

16:07.634 --> 16:10.763
- Whoo!
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Hello?

16:13.015 --> 16:15.351
Oh. Ew!

16:18.812 --> 16:20.147
Get that thing, girl.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.859
- I feel like I'm...
- Okay. Wanna see the boss?

16:26.236 --> 16:28.155
Hey!

16:30.991 --> 16:31.992
My turn.

16:34.745 --> 16:38.082
And because you're new,
I'm going to give the last bite to you.

16:40.542 --> 16:44.797
The man who lives up here
fought in some wars. And he drinks beer.

16:45.047 --> 16:48.008
This guy has a disease
that makes his feet large.

16:48.342 --> 16:52.221
Oh, and no one uses
the elevator 'cause it smells like pee.

16:52.304 --> 16:55.224
The man who lives in here
gets arrested a lot.

16:55.307 --> 16:59.520
This... This woman in here
thinks she's married to Jesus.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.563
Oh, watch out, watch out for the water.

17:01.647 --> 17:04.400
'Cause guess what.
I went to the hospital one time.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.444
These are the rooms
we're not supposed to go in.

17:08.487 --> 17:09.905
But let's go anyway!

17:17.329 --> 17:18.329
Oh, fuck!

17:20.040 --> 17:21.040
Bobby!

17:34.847 --> 17:36.640
What's going on?
Where's the power?

17:37.057 --> 17:39.560
Bobby!

17:40.185 --> 17:43.397
Hey, what the fuck, man?
I pay my rent, $1,000 a month.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.190
Can't fucking get electricity.

17:45.274 --> 17:47.109
I'm on it! I'm on it! Folks, come on.

17:47.693 --> 17:49.236
Come on, give me a minute.

17:49.445 --> 17:51.947
- It's gonna be all right.
- It's the hottest day.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.241
I'm gonna get your power working.
I know. I know.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.660
I can't rush any faster than I'm going.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.495
- What's wrong?
- What did Bobby do now?

18:14.928 --> 18:18.307
Trauma's over, folks.
You got your power back.

18:19.349 --> 18:23.812
Can use your TVs, VCRs, AC, what have you.

18:24.897 --> 18:26.023
Have a nice day!

18:26.523 --> 18:27.941
Love you, Bobby!

18:29.109 --> 18:30.277
I love you too.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.531
Try paying the bills, Bobby.

18:35.199 --> 18:36.700
You're due too, brother.

18:40.996 --> 18:44.833
Crock pots, hot plates. These rooms are
not designed for extended stay, Gloria.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.418
You know that, for fucking sake.

18:46.502 --> 18:48.146
- What do you want us to do?
- I pay a lot of...

18:48.170 --> 18:50.064
The electric was out
for five minutes, that's it.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.924
Yeah, I want a discount for this week.

18:52.007 --> 18:54.727
Why don't you just check out
and go down to the fucking Wishing Star?

18:58.472 --> 19:00.432
Hmm.

19:02.726 --> 19:04.686
Mm-hmm.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.857
I like Whale. He's nice.

19:10.526 --> 19:12.486
Well, he's not nice to me!

19:13.362 --> 19:15.072
Look.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.657
Daddy...

19:23.789 --> 19:25.149
Moonee, you're not gonna get that?

19:27.376 --> 19:29.586
- Yeah?
- Halley, open the door.

19:30.128 --> 19:32.130
Fucking A. What'd you do now?

19:33.382 --> 19:34.758
Open the door, Halley.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.176
Yeah?

19:38.178 --> 19:43.058
I got a videotape of the kids
illegally entering the utility room.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.685
Don't act guilty, okay?

19:45.561 --> 19:49.565
Hey, Scooty? Did you hear
what I just said to her? Okay.

19:49.648 --> 19:51.233
I got it. Imma talk to her.

19:51.942 --> 19:53.819
Happens again, you're outta here.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.280
It's only the second week of the summer,

19:56.363 --> 19:59.074
and there's already been
a dead fish in the pool...

19:59.157 --> 20:02.786
We were doing an experiment.
We were trying to get it back alive!

20:02.869 --> 20:05.622
- That wasn't my idea.
- And water balloons thrown at tourists.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.040
You can't fuck with tourists.

20:07.124 --> 20:09.209
- They didn't tip us.
- Are you serious?

20:09.293 --> 20:11.837
- No...
- Oh, my God, this is unacceptable.

20:12.170 --> 20:15.716
I've failed as a mother, Moonee.
You've disgraced me.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.135
- Halley...
- Yeah, Mom. You're a disgrace.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.762
And, I'm gonna talk to Ashley, by the way.

20:21.305 --> 20:24.391
When your friend
puts you in charge of her kid,

20:25.017 --> 20:27.978
that kid becomes your responsibility.

20:28.312 --> 20:29.938
You ain't taking responsibility.

20:30.022 --> 20:32.182
And you got that one too.
She's from FutureLand, right?

20:32.232 --> 20:34.735
Oh, whatevs. You gotta relax, my man.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.279
You gonna redo my expense reports
with your whatevs?

20:37.529 --> 20:40.073
Your kid killed my night.
I wanted to watch the ballgame.

20:40.157 --> 20:42.826
You gonna pay me for three hours
that I gotta work later?

20:43.702 --> 20:46.413
Hey, guys,
pay the man for his three hours.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.707
I don't have any money.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.208
We don't have any money.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.502
- You're shit outta luck.
- Speaking of which...

20:53.211 --> 20:54.963
You haven't given me this week's rent yet.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.132
You don't think I know that? Chill.

21:09.519 --> 21:10.519
Thank you.

21:11.605 --> 21:13.774
- You done here?
- Yeah.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.069
- Thank you.
- Watch those kids.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.572
I think I wanna go home now.

21:26.078 --> 21:29.665
Wait. Uh, hold on. I, uh...
Sir, I think we're at the wrong place.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.708
This the address you gave me.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.336
What did he say?

21:34.419 --> 21:38.340
No, I-I-I... There's a problem.
Uh... This is not where we're staying.

21:38.632 --> 21:40.217
Hey, you wanna check the address?

21:41.968 --> 21:44.763
We are going to the Magic Kingdom...

21:44.846 --> 21:48.308
You said you booked a hotel
at the Magic Kingdom.

21:48.975 --> 21:52.646
That everything was taken care of.

21:52.729 --> 21:55.440
What is this,
we are not even on Disney property.

21:55.524 --> 21:57.484
Shit. Joao booked it for me. I don't know.

21:58.652 --> 22:01.780
You had your assistant
book our honeymoon hotel?

22:01.863 --> 22:04.491
What's going on? How can I help?

22:04.658 --> 22:07.119
Look. They made the reservation online...

22:13.208 --> 22:14.459
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.507
Hey, what's up, man?

22:22.092 --> 22:23.092
Yeah!

22:24.469 --> 22:26.012
Ooh. Nice bags.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.808
- Are those guys tourists?
- Hey, man.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.102
I'm gonna have to charge you wait time.

22:32.185 --> 22:33.270
I'm missing calls.

22:35.939 --> 22:38.942
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll get the new address. One second.

22:39.401 --> 22:42.237
Look, just call the company, all right?
Just call the company...

22:47.200 --> 22:48.952
- She looks pretty.
- Yeah.

22:49.661 --> 22:52.330
But I feel bad for her,
'cause she's about to cry.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.127
I can always tell
when adults are about to cry.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.382
You can tell that?

23:02.841 --> 23:04.760
Yep. 'Cause look what I'm drawing.

23:08.597 --> 23:10.223
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

23:10.307 --> 23:11.391
What's up, Bobby?

23:11.475 --> 23:13.268
- It's almost midnight.
- Get your bags.

23:13.351 --> 23:16.313
The only room you're gonna find
is a single along this stretch.

23:16.396 --> 23:19.566
I offered them a AAA discount.
She doesn't want...

23:19.649 --> 23:22.736
See my wife, there? Okay? She's Brazilian.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.571
Brazilians love Disney.

23:24.654 --> 23:26.758
She's been coming here
since she was a kid, all right?

23:26.782 --> 23:29.326
And her dream
is to have her honeymoon at Disney.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.703
- Everybody...
- Ma'am, they're just trying to get a tip.

23:31.787 --> 23:33.079
Yeah, tips are grateful.

23:33.163 --> 23:33.997
- Hey, kids. Kids.
- What are these stray children

23:34.080 --> 23:34.915
rummaging about?

23:34.998 --> 23:36.875
- Come on.
- This is a welfare, slum motel.

23:36.958 --> 23:38.060
- Leave her alone.
- We're spending our honeymoon

23:38.084 --> 23:39.669
in a gypsy project?

23:39.753 --> 23:42.214
Find another place.

23:42.297 --> 23:44.299
Check the Polynesian first.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.926
Or the Grand Floridian.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.052
I told you.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.988
- Leave her alone.
- We're spending our honeymoon

23:49.012 --> 23:49.846
The resorts are booked.

23:49.930 --> 23:51.431
I'm not staying here.

24:10.242 --> 24:11.576
Does this have to be here?

24:14.663 --> 24:17.415
Guests come through this door,
for Christ's sake, Bobby.

24:18.959 --> 24:21.169
Will you go talk to her?
Tell her to go to the back.

24:21.253 --> 24:22.253
Yes, sir.

24:24.464 --> 24:25.298
Excuse me.

24:25.382 --> 24:26.609
- Um, hi.
- Who's in charge here?

24:26.633 --> 24:27.467
Yeah, that's me.

24:27.551 --> 24:28.385
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.512
Could you move the van
to the back of the building?

24:31.012 --> 24:32.132
To the back of the building.

24:32.180 --> 24:34.850
- So right behind these stairs right there.
- Excuse me! Excuse me!

24:35.016 --> 24:37.203
- What would you like?
- I want that. I want that. I want that.

24:37.227 --> 24:38.227
You got it.

24:38.353 --> 24:40.033
- Enjoy your day.
- Thanks, thanks, thanks.

24:40.105 --> 24:44.776
- I want... that. That, that, that. Thanks.
- Of course. Yeah.

24:44.860 --> 24:47.445
And I'll take the raspberry croissants.

24:48.321 --> 24:49.906
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Thanks.

24:49.990 --> 24:50.866
Have a nice day.

24:50.949 --> 24:53.410
Have a blessed day, sir.
Thank you so much.

24:53.869 --> 24:55.096
Okay. Yeah. Let's get it packed up.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.480
Okay. Let's go. Show me the books.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.417
Watch. Watch this. Watch. Watch.

25:00.500 --> 25:04.754
Watch, watch, watch. Watch. Watch!

25:04.838 --> 25:05.839
Stop!

25:12.178 --> 25:15.265
Ooh, spider. Let's see if it farts.

25:18.226 --> 25:19.269
Oh, fuck.

25:20.937 --> 25:23.064
I would have worn gloves
if I knew there was bedbugs.

25:23.481 --> 25:24.316
What?

25:24.399 --> 25:26.680
I would have worn gloves
if you told me there was bedbugs.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.366
Well, the purple looks nice.

25:34.159 --> 25:36.494
- Yeah.
- How much did that put you back?

25:36.661 --> 25:40.290
Well, Narek spent about 20k on it.

25:40.957 --> 25:42.542
You can't afford an exterminator?

25:43.919 --> 25:45.837
- Huh?
- I don't know.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.010
Hey. Hey.

25:52.344 --> 25:55.889
Uh, you should be using longer strips.
It works better.

26:04.564 --> 26:07.484
- Whatcha doing?
- Top secret.

26:08.276 --> 26:11.071
- Really?
- Guys, I need you outta here.

26:11.154 --> 26:13.990
- You guys are boring anyway.
- Yeah, I know.

26:14.616 --> 26:15.616
Catch ya later.

26:31.508 --> 26:32.509
Fuck.

26:36.346 --> 26:37.389
Shit.

27:03.331 --> 27:06.209
- I wanna play it.
- Guys, share.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.961
Share. Come on. Let her play it one time.

27:08.336 --> 27:10.463
- You gotta...
- Help her though.

27:11.006 --> 27:12.966
- Let me help.
- No, hold on.

27:13.216 --> 27:14.718
- Let her figure it out.
- No, stop.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.001
Scooty, let her figure it out.

27:16.052 --> 27:18.847
No. she gotta play that game
that we were playing. That...

27:18.930 --> 27:19.973
No, I don't.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.600
No, she doesn't.
Let her do whatever she wants.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.127
Thanks for calling The Magic Castle.
It's Amber.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.547
Yeah. We sure do.

27:53.381 --> 27:54.591
Thirty-eight dollars a night.

27:57.552 --> 27:58.720
Well, we're here all night.

28:00.221 --> 28:01.221
Yeah.

28:02.223 --> 28:03.558
All righty. Thanks a lot.

28:06.061 --> 28:07.353
- Okay, out.
- But...

28:07.437 --> 28:10.732
- I warned ya, one drip and you're out.
- Oh, come on!

28:10.815 --> 28:13.693
- Out, now.
- It's gonna melt outside.

28:13.777 --> 28:16.446
Obviously, it's melting inside, too.

28:16.529 --> 28:17.529
- But, Bobby...
- Out.

28:19.115 --> 28:21.367
Thank you very much.

28:21.451 --> 28:22.786
You're not welcome!

28:26.664 --> 28:28.500
Bobby could be such a shitty.

28:29.334 --> 28:30.334
True.

28:36.883 --> 28:40.261
Gloria!

28:42.347 --> 28:44.891
I wanna knock, I wanna knock,
I wanna knock.

28:46.476 --> 28:49.270
- We need Jancey.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoa!

28:49.354 --> 28:51.397
One light knock will do, guys.

28:51.481 --> 28:52.565
I see her!

28:53.233 --> 28:54.818
Come on, Jancey, come on!

28:57.779 --> 29:01.157
Remember last time, she fell
in the pool 'cause she was dancing?

29:02.325 --> 29:03.409
Come on, Scooty!

29:05.537 --> 29:06.537
Come on!

29:07.038 --> 29:08.665
Come on Moonee, come on!

29:09.415 --> 29:11.042
- Coming!
- Scooty!

29:12.043 --> 29:13.043
Hey, look!

29:14.295 --> 29:17.465
No, we have to...

29:20.552 --> 29:22.137
They look so funny.

29:24.514 --> 29:28.309
I'm doing the tango.
I'm doing the jango.

29:28.935 --> 29:29.978
Guys!

29:30.562 --> 29:32.355
- Guys.
- Come on!

29:32.772 --> 29:33.940
Guys, wait!

29:35.316 --> 29:37.694
Come on! I see her.

29:41.030 --> 29:43.950
Right there.
Hey, let's see what she's doing.

29:44.492 --> 29:46.161
- Stretching her legs.
- Guys!

29:46.244 --> 29:47.787
Guys, she's stretching her legs.

29:48.329 --> 29:52.041
- Moonee. Moonee, come on. Moonee.
- Coming!

29:52.584 --> 29:57.172
- Look at her.
- Hey, guys, come on. Right there.

30:00.008 --> 30:01.008
Come on!

30:04.304 --> 30:05.305
Look.

30:08.850 --> 30:14.189
Boobies. Boobies.
Boobies. Boobies.

30:14.355 --> 30:18.151
Hey! Her boobies are so big
that I can rub my face in them.

30:22.655 --> 30:25.783
Banana boobs, banana boobs, banana boobs.

30:25.867 --> 30:28.661
- Guys, Bobby!
- Bobby! Duck!

30:28.745 --> 30:29.787
Oh, no!

30:30.622 --> 30:32.498
Get down. Scooty.

30:37.170 --> 30:38.421
Gloria.

30:38.713 --> 30:40.882
We talked about this before. Cover up.

30:40.965 --> 30:43.509
- Cover what up?
- You know what I'm talking about.

30:43.593 --> 30:45.845
- I do not know.
- These kids don't need...

30:45.929 --> 30:49.974
- What kids are here? There's no kids here.
- Kids are right over there.

30:52.018 --> 30:55.980
- Oh. They should be in school, kids.
- It's summer break.

30:58.274 --> 31:00.860
- Did he catch us?
- I think he did.

31:00.944 --> 31:02.487
Can you read? What's that say?

31:02.570 --> 31:04.656
- "Pool rules."
- No, the other one.

31:04.948 --> 31:10.536
- Oh. No tits allowed. No, what?
- No alcoholic beverages in pool area.

31:10.620 --> 31:14.040
Okay, I'll do that, but I still wanna
go topless with my big titties.

31:14.123 --> 31:14.999
Gloria.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.125
Oh!

31:16.793 --> 31:18.586
I think she's having a talk with him.

31:19.462 --> 31:21.005
Let me go look, guys. Get down.

31:21.089 --> 31:23.633
No, I will... I'll go.

31:23.716 --> 31:25.009
You're a beautiful woman...

31:25.093 --> 31:27.178
Oh, no. Bobby's gonna make her...

31:28.721 --> 31:33.351
- Just put them away. Cover them up.
- Cover the fuck up, you cover yourself up.

31:33.685 --> 31:35.019
Does this happen all the time?

31:35.603 --> 31:37.605
Yep. And it's great.

31:38.106 --> 31:40.191
- This is what you gotta do.
- Ah!

31:40.275 --> 31:41.752
- Hey! Uh-oh.
- That's the way it works here.

31:41.776 --> 31:43.987
Uh-oh, he's about... Call the sheriff.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.446
- He just touched my tit.
- Bobby!

31:45.530 --> 31:48.241
Bobby, boobies.

31:48.324 --> 31:51.119
- Go back to your room. Go.
- He molested me, Officer.

31:51.202 --> 31:52.829
I'm gonna sue this fucking motel,

31:52.912 --> 31:56.207
with this fucking pervert
that just touched my fucking titties.

31:56.291 --> 31:58.543
Hey, Gloria, rub 'em.

31:58.626 --> 32:03.464
- Rub your boobs on his face so he can ge...
- Get the hell outta here!

32:12.849 --> 32:15.435
Kids, out.

32:16.019 --> 32:17.186
Stop!

32:17.478 --> 32:18.604
- He in?
- Yeah.

32:21.816 --> 32:23.568
No, that's not how you do it.

32:24.777 --> 32:27.613
- Ice machine.
- Yeah, well, it can't be fixed. But I'm...

32:27.697 --> 32:29.449
- Three months.
- We need ice!

32:29.824 --> 32:31.302
- Three months. Three months.
- I know.

32:31.326 --> 32:32.493
Uh, Patrice?

32:33.369 --> 32:37.790
Uh... Keep an eye on 151. There's been
traffic in and out of there all day.

32:39.876 --> 32:43.087
- Really?
- Okay, okay.

32:43.379 --> 32:45.089
I'll take care of it in the morning.

32:45.423 --> 32:48.593
- I can't whistle.
- You can't whistle?

32:49.177 --> 32:51.471
You're going to have to train him, Bobby.

32:51.554 --> 32:53.014
Stop it!

33:14.577 --> 33:15.577
Time to go.

33:19.957 --> 33:22.043
Come on. Let's go.

33:23.836 --> 33:26.798
What the fuck is you talking about?
I paid my room for a week now.

33:26.881 --> 33:29.175
I'm not leaving the property.
I don't care.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.594
- You're breaking the rules.
- Nobody's breaking rules.

33:31.677 --> 33:32.553
What are you talking about?

33:32.637 --> 33:34.490
How would you like it
if I called the sheriff's office?

33:34.514 --> 33:35.348
Oh, yeah?

33:35.431 --> 33:37.451
- You're gonna call the sheriff's office?
- Then we can figure things out.

33:37.475 --> 33:40.853
- Oh, really? Really?
- Your man knows what the story is.

33:41.813 --> 33:43.231
Mom, can we get this one?

33:43.856 --> 33:45.650
No, we're gonna gotta get the <i>fugazi</i> ones.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.402
We have to look at these boxes, okay?

33:50.988 --> 33:53.658
If I buy more than 20,
can you give me a discount?

33:54.951 --> 33:56.744
This is wholesale.

33:57.078 --> 34:00.164
Mom, what about this one?
You can smell like Justin Bieber.

34:08.755 --> 34:11.509
Hey, hey. We're selling perfume.

34:11.759 --> 34:13.302
- Yeah, this one.
- No, listen...

34:13.511 --> 34:15.596
It'll make your wife smell really good.

34:18.141 --> 34:21.393
- You have Jimmy Choo?
- Yeah, it's amazing. It's only $20.

34:21.726 --> 34:25.022
They're so much more expensive
in the store, it's a really good deal.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.567
- Do you wanna buy some perfume?
- Ma'am?

34:27.650 --> 34:30.735
- Do you wanna buy some perfume?
- Not really. She might.

34:30.820 --> 34:34.657
No? It smells like designer.
We're having a really good deal.

34:35.158 --> 34:36.033
Yeah.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.886
- This one...
- Would you like to buy some perfume?

34:37.909 --> 34:40.705
Yeah. This one will make all the girls
flirt on you.

34:41.289 --> 34:45.083
I have samples if you wanna try some, but
we have a whole bunch of different ones.

34:45.168 --> 34:47.628
Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

34:47.712 --> 34:50.422
- Yes!
- Girl! Woot, woot!

34:51.966 --> 34:53.842
Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:55.094 --> 34:58.973
Seriously, if you're gonna be late again,
you gotta let me know.

34:59.348 --> 35:03.561
- It was due yesterday.
- Yeah, that's right. It was due yesterday.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.481
Whatevs. Why you gotta count it,
like I'm broke?

35:08.649 --> 35:11.527
- I just gotta make sure.
- Gotta make sure what?

35:12.028 --> 35:14.030
It's the right amount.
It's a simple thing.

35:14.113 --> 35:16.574
I just counted it. I can't count?
You think I can't count?

35:16.908 --> 35:20.536
Listen. Honey. Honey. I trust you.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.122
- Do you?
- Yep. Uh...

35:23.581 --> 35:26.042
So then put that in your...

35:26.125 --> 35:27.335
May I count it?

35:27.710 --> 35:28.836
May I count it?

35:29.378 --> 35:33.132
Good girl, you got your rent.
Let me count it. Get outta here.

35:33.216 --> 35:34.425
- Bye.
- Bye.

35:37.845 --> 35:40.806
Dicky! You wanna say bye to your room?

35:41.265 --> 35:42.600
- Nah.
- You good?

35:43.351 --> 35:46.103
That's right, player.
That's right. Awesome.

35:46.687 --> 35:48.564
Hey, Dicky, I can't take this.

35:49.565 --> 35:51.045
Look, there's no room in here at all.

35:51.442 --> 35:54.403
I'm gonna buy you new toys when we get
to New Orleans, okay? I promise.

35:54.487 --> 35:56.007
Come on, guys. Take whatever you want.

35:57.031 --> 35:58.471
Grab whatever you want out of there.

35:59.909 --> 36:01.702
- Here you go, guys.
- I got the gun.

36:02.370 --> 36:04.997
- Dad! Please.
- Here, here, here.

36:05.790 --> 36:08.209
All new stuff, kid. All new stuff.

36:08.543 --> 36:10.711
- Just imagine, all new stuff.
- Fine.

36:10.795 --> 36:12.588
My mom said, "Have fun."

36:13.005 --> 36:15.424
All right guys. Here.
You can have the whole box.

36:15.508 --> 36:17.028
Take the whole box with you, go ahead.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.803
Bye, Joyce. Bye.

36:19.303 --> 36:20.763
Yo, T. Take care, bro, all right?

36:21.389 --> 36:23.808
You hold this place down for me
while I'm gone, you hear?

36:24.100 --> 36:25.726
- You be good, okay sweetie?
- Okay.

36:26.352 --> 36:28.354
- Bye Dicky!
- See you later!

36:45.496 --> 36:49.208
- Hey, you wanna see something cool?
- Yeah.

36:50.334 --> 36:53.045
- Okay. Make sure you don't tell anyone.
- Okay.

36:53.921 --> 36:56.340
Look. And it has a naked girl on it.

36:58.968 --> 37:01.220
Did you steal that?

37:02.638 --> 37:03.638
Eh.

37:04.557 --> 37:05.891
Moon, Scoot!

37:06.475 --> 37:08.185
Yeah, Mom?

37:08.269 --> 37:10.938
Get off your butts
and go get some waffles.

37:11.230 --> 37:14.317
- My mom wanted extra maple syrup.
- It's in there.

37:15.401 --> 37:17.862
- Okay, guys, go. Have fun, be careful.
- Okay.

37:17.945 --> 37:20.406
Hey, Scooty, it's actually for me.

37:22.658 --> 37:24.368
- What are you, twerking over here?
- Yeah.

37:27.038 --> 37:30.708
- Let me see. Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Mommy. Mom... Mommy.

37:33.002 --> 37:36.547
Oh, wow. You got some twerk skills, girl.

37:36.964 --> 37:39.550
- Yass!
- Now watch me shake my booty.

37:39.633 --> 37:42.595
- Ooh!
- Now watch me shake my booty.

37:53.397 --> 37:55.399
Yo, you heard this song, bitch?

37:55.483 --> 37:56.817
It's mad lit.

38:00.905 --> 38:04.158
Wait. Hold up. Wait. Bitch,
did that guy from OBT ever call you?

38:04.742 --> 38:06.786
- Yeah.
- What's good with that?

38:07.620 --> 38:09.622
He's mad fucking whack.

38:09.705 --> 38:11.082
I tried to chill with him.

38:12.124 --> 38:13.292
He doesn't like kids.

38:14.585 --> 38:18.839
Oh. Goodbye. Good night.
Take several seats.

38:18.923 --> 38:21.175
- Who you telling?
- Face it.

38:23.010 --> 38:27.181
Yo, by the way,
you gotta do me a fucking favor.

38:28.015 --> 38:32.269
Next time Moonee comes to you to get food,

38:32.895 --> 38:35.231
don't give her no fucking maple syrup.

38:35.564 --> 38:38.234
This bitch has been farting...

38:38.317 --> 38:40.194
Good night, bitch. I love you!

38:40.277 --> 38:41.862
Love you. Night, bitch.

38:48.953 --> 38:50.037
Mm, mm, mm.

38:50.121 --> 38:51.497
I'm gonna kiss it.

38:53.624 --> 38:56.252
Can I have a bite on the ice cream then?

39:01.507 --> 39:04.260
- Mm, mm, mm.
- Pretty good.

39:04.343 --> 39:08.973
Hey, kids! How many times have I told you
that you can't be hanging out there?

39:09.056 --> 39:10.558
We're paying customers.

39:10.641 --> 39:12.494
I don't care.
You can't be bothering my customers.

39:12.518 --> 39:15.062
- Go. Get out.
- No. You don't tell us what to do.

39:15.146 --> 39:16.146
Hey!

39:16.981 --> 39:19.316
- Yeah, lady!
- Be quiet!

39:19.525 --> 39:22.653
Hey. Hey, girls, come on.

39:22.736 --> 39:26.073
- We're hiding! This is serious, Bobby.
- I'm working.

39:26.157 --> 39:29.243
We need to hide, we need to hide.
We need to hide. Go, go, go, go.

39:29.326 --> 39:30.369
No, not back...

39:30.453 --> 39:31.787
- We don't care.
- Now be quiet.

39:32.538 --> 39:34.415
And watch those wires down there.

39:36.417 --> 39:39.753
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch the wires down there, girls!

39:39.837 --> 39:40.837
No, no, no, no.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.636
Have you seen Moon... Yes!

39:48.220 --> 39:49.430
Don't blow our cover.

39:50.097 --> 39:51.390
Where's Moonee and Jancey?

39:53.225 --> 39:55.060
I got you! I got you!

39:55.436 --> 39:57.146
I got you! I got you guys!

39:57.480 --> 39:59.982
- Move, Bobby!
- Excuse me.

40:15.498 --> 40:18.167
Have a safe trip!

40:18.459 --> 40:19.793
Hallelujah!

40:20.377 --> 40:23.380
Hallelujah! Thank you, Lord Jesus!

40:24.048 --> 40:25.633
No boys allowed!

40:25.716 --> 40:26.759
No!

40:26.842 --> 40:28.093
No boys!

40:28.511 --> 40:30.346
Do that one more time, and...

40:37.228 --> 40:38.062
Hi, kids.

40:38.145 --> 40:39.980
- Okay! I'm gonna...
- Hey! Go ahead.

40:40.814 --> 40:41.690
You having fun?

40:41.774 --> 40:43.609
This is the girl's table.

40:57.456 --> 40:58.456
Oh!

40:59.291 --> 41:02.836
- Fuck! Shit! What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, buddy.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.064
- It was an accident.
- You almost hit me.

41:04.088 --> 41:05.172
- I...
- Fuck, man.

41:05.256 --> 41:07.174
Okay. I'm sorry, man.
Punk ass bitch.

41:07.258 --> 41:08.467
Whoa. Whoa!

41:11.929 --> 41:13.722
Ah. What's your name?

41:14.181 --> 41:15.599
Excuse me, can I help you?

41:16.016 --> 41:19.144
- Uh... No, that's okay.
- What's okay?

41:19.770 --> 41:23.315
Moonee, get off that picnic table.
People eat on that thing. Come on, girl.

41:24.733 --> 41:25.734
You're a guest here?

41:26.110 --> 41:30.406
Uh. No... I'm looking for...
a soda machine.

41:31.282 --> 41:33.826
You come to a motel to get a soda?

41:34.201 --> 41:36.996
Yeah. Uh... It's okay...

41:37.079 --> 41:39.582
- I appreciate it.
- No. Come on, come with me.

41:39.665 --> 41:40.541
Come with me.

41:40.624 --> 41:42.064
I know where there's a soda machine.

41:42.543 --> 41:43.603
- No, no.
- Just come with me.

41:43.627 --> 41:46.171
You want a soda, right?

41:46.839 --> 41:49.675
Yeah, yeah. I was passing by
on the highway...

41:49.758 --> 41:51.385
Get off that picnic table!

41:52.303 --> 41:54.179
- I was just passing by...
- Yeah?

41:54.263 --> 41:57.474
And, and I wanted to get a soda
'cause uh... I needed a soda.

41:57.558 --> 41:58.726
You were parched, huh?

41:59.393 --> 42:03.272
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- You wanted to wet that palate, right?

42:04.064 --> 42:08.527
Yeah. I never did get used
to the humidity here.

42:08.611 --> 42:11.363
It's okay. Uh... The machine's up there.

42:12.072 --> 42:16.118
- So you like soda, huh?
- Uh, yeah, yeah. It's good.

42:16.535 --> 42:22.833
You know, I read in a magazine that soda's
not so good for quenching your thirst.

42:23.208 --> 42:26.420
- I agree. Yeah. Yeah.
- You noticed that? You know what's better?

42:26.503 --> 42:27.671
- What?
- Tea.

42:27.755 --> 42:29.548
- T-Tea?
- Tea. Hot tea.

42:29.632 --> 42:31.800
- Hot tea. Like...
- Yeah, yeah, I drink that.

42:31.884 --> 42:34.094
- You do? Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

42:34.428 --> 42:38.182
No, no. It's... It's right up here.
Just a little more ways.

42:38.265 --> 42:40.684
You came for a soda,
we're gonna get you a soda. Right?

42:41.477 --> 42:44.980
Yeah, but I-I... I wanted to...
I-I had to have a walk.

42:45.064 --> 42:46.607
Yeah, well, you're gettin' a walk.

42:47.149 --> 42:52.112
It's right up here. You'll get your soda.
And you can have a walk.

43:11.340 --> 43:13.926
What a choice.

43:14.843 --> 43:16.470
- Okay, thank you.
- Hey.

43:18.013 --> 43:20.015
- I thought you were thirsty.
- Yeah.

43:20.099 --> 43:21.433
Aren't you gonna drink it now?

43:23.143 --> 43:24.561
Yeah. Yes.

43:29.775 --> 43:30.775
Good?

43:31.527 --> 43:32.527
Sure.

43:33.320 --> 43:34.446
Get the fuck outta here.

43:35.322 --> 43:38.826
You come on this property again, and you
won't be leaving it. You understand?

43:38.909 --> 43:40.469
I don't know what you're talking about.

43:40.494 --> 43:44.123
You don't know what I'm talking about?
You gonna play it that way, huh?

43:48.377 --> 43:49.377
Hey.

43:50.087 --> 43:51.087
- Hey!
- All right.

43:52.339 --> 43:54.091
Charlie Coachman...

43:55.217 --> 43:56.760
of Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

43:57.177 --> 43:58.737
You can't keep that, that's my license.

43:59.179 --> 44:02.599
I'm gonna call your name in
to the county sheriff.

44:02.975 --> 44:05.436
Now you get the fuck outta here!

44:10.441 --> 44:13.652
Get going. Get going!

44:16.363 --> 44:19.616
Don't you stop!

44:34.465 --> 44:36.216
I'm making a sand castle.

44:36.759 --> 44:39.720
- Excuse me, do you wanna buy some perfume?
- I'm sorry?

44:39.803 --> 44:41.096
Do you wanna buy some perfume?

44:41.180 --> 44:43.932
- We're selling perfume.
- I don't have cash on me.

44:44.183 --> 44:45.392
Okay. Thank you.

44:46.769 --> 44:49.104
- No, thank you.
- This will make you handsome!

44:49.480 --> 44:52.191
Come on. Actually... Actually, sir?

44:52.733 --> 44:55.402
Can you just give us a couple bucks?
Just for me and my kid,

44:55.486 --> 44:57.029
if you're not gonna buy the perfume?

44:57.237 --> 44:58.781
- Look...
- Please.

45:02.075 --> 45:04.536
- Have a great day.
- Thank you so much!

45:04.953 --> 45:06.121
Yass!

45:06.997 --> 45:08.582
Let your head back.

45:08.665 --> 45:10.292
Let your head back.

45:17.633 --> 45:21.929
- Do you want to get splashed?
- No. No. No!

45:28.310 --> 45:31.688
Jancey. This is gonna be scary.

45:32.105 --> 45:34.358
Yeah!
There's ghosts in there.

45:35.943 --> 45:39.696
- Are we going in there?
- No. You'll see.

45:42.699 --> 45:46.703
- It's spooky.
- Spooky.

45:58.173 --> 46:00.384
- Hey, you wanna see a joke?
- What?

46:02.928 --> 46:05.264
- Ready?
- Voilà!

46:05.764 --> 46:07.432
Wait for me, guys.

46:07.516 --> 46:09.726
What a gentleman you are.

46:18.694 --> 46:19.694
Yeah.

46:20.863 --> 46:23.115
Scooty, will you marry me?

46:23.490 --> 46:25.242
Well... Not right now.

46:26.743 --> 46:30.455
- You may kiss the bride.
- I said not right now! Ew.

46:30.789 --> 46:31.957
Ew.

46:32.791 --> 46:35.836
- What is this place?
- The "abandids".

46:36.253 --> 46:40.424
One... Two... Three!

46:48.056 --> 46:50.183
Hey, you know there's alligators in there?

46:51.059 --> 46:52.102
Really?

46:53.645 --> 46:57.691
Look, if I had a pet alligator,
I would name mine Anne.

47:01.069 --> 47:03.238
Ha. Ooh, look, a pillow!

47:04.907 --> 47:05.991
Cool.

47:07.034 --> 47:11.622
I bet this house was built
hundreds of years ago.

47:11.705 --> 47:13.206
Oh! This could be a dance room!

47:13.498 --> 47:15.000
Party with beer.

47:15.083 --> 47:18.545
Party with beer.
Party with beer.

47:19.004 --> 47:20.756
Party with beer!

47:21.340 --> 47:24.009
Oh, my gosh! Come here Jancey!

47:24.092 --> 47:25.594
Ghost poop.

47:26.261 --> 47:29.306
- Ew!
- Yeah!

47:34.102 --> 47:36.521
This would be my bed.

47:37.189 --> 47:39.149
And that would be my bookshelf.

47:39.608 --> 47:44.154
No. Actually, my bed would be
right in the middle. And lots of toys!

47:48.617 --> 47:49.618
Scooty!

47:49.910 --> 47:52.412
- What are you breaking?
- The wall.

47:57.459 --> 47:59.461
Good luck!

48:03.131 --> 48:04.131
Woo-hoo!

48:10.097 --> 48:12.641
Oh. The fireplace.

48:13.141 --> 48:14.851
I have the best idea.

48:15.185 --> 48:18.397
Scooty! We need your lighter!

48:18.480 --> 48:21.566
- Push it in.
- This is going to be the best fire ever.

48:21.650 --> 48:24.861
- Light it up, Scooty!
- Yeah. Light it up!

48:33.662 --> 48:36.164
Whoa, guys. Whoa. Whoa.

48:36.331 --> 48:38.750
- We're gonna be in so much trouble.
- No!

48:38.834 --> 48:42.295
Um, just... Jancey, go home. Bye.
Don't tell anyone.

48:42.379 --> 48:43.380
Don't tell your grandma.

48:43.463 --> 48:44.881
- Okay. Bye. Bye.
- Okay.

48:46.425 --> 48:48.635
- Don't tell anyone!
- Okay!

48:50.470 --> 48:55.350
- Scooty, don't tell your mom, okay?
- Okay.

48:58.061 --> 48:59.104
Excuse me.

49:00.439 --> 49:03.817
Moon, the old condos are on fire.
You wanna go check them out?

49:10.032 --> 49:11.074
Whoo!

49:17.789 --> 49:20.292
Scooty, come on.
Don't you wanna see the burning house?

49:21.001 --> 49:24.254
No. I just wanna stay here and watch TV.

49:25.922 --> 49:27.299
- Scooty?
- Hurry up, bitch.

49:27.382 --> 49:29.009
I don't wanna miss this.

49:30.886 --> 49:32.971
- I'll meet you there.
- Hurry up, bitch.

49:42.689 --> 49:46.234
Look at me.
You tell me the truth right now.

49:47.277 --> 49:49.905
Do you understand what will happen to us
if you did this?

49:50.739 --> 49:53.200
Do you want the fucking DCF
down here, Scooty?

50:02.709 --> 50:06.755
- You need to tell me the truth right now.
- I didn't do it.

50:07.130 --> 50:09.633
Don't lie to me. Please don't lie to me.

50:13.553 --> 50:17.099
This isn't a game, Scooty. This is not
a joke right now. I need to know.

50:26.650 --> 50:29.611
- Hey, girl!
- Hi!

50:29.694 --> 50:33.240
Aren't you excited?
This is so much better than TV.

50:33.573 --> 50:35.992
Can I take a picture of you?
I wanna send it to Ashley.

50:36.076 --> 50:37.160
Stand right there.

50:37.953 --> 50:39.579
Smile, girlfriend.

50:40.997 --> 50:43.375
It used to be a big crackhead spot.

50:43.458 --> 50:47.587
Prostituting and all that.
Let it burn. Let it burn.

50:54.678 --> 50:55.838
You got another one of those?

50:57.305 --> 50:58.640
For you?

51:00.934 --> 51:02.477
- Here, babe.
- Thanks.

51:07.732 --> 51:10.485
- You just like me for my cigarettes now.
- No.

51:10.861 --> 51:11.861
That's right.

51:11.903 --> 51:13.714
- You wouldn't have even said hello...
- That's not so.

51:13.738 --> 51:16.283
- ...if I didn't have cigarettes.
- That's not true.

51:16.366 --> 51:17.617
No wonder I don't like you.

51:18.451 --> 51:19.703
Could've been arson.

51:21.538 --> 51:23.582
- Could've been.
- I don't know.

51:23.665 --> 51:27.294
They were so fucking ugly,
I was thinking of burning them down.

51:39.181 --> 51:40.181
Ashley?

51:42.100 --> 51:46.897
- Hi, Miss Ashley. Is Scooty here?
- Moonee, tell your mom no more food. Okay?

51:48.273 --> 51:50.775
- Okay. Is...
- I have to go work, okay?

51:50.859 --> 51:52.360
- Is Scooty here?
- No, he's not.

51:52.444 --> 51:55.363
- Well, he's not at home.
- Yeah, I know. He's with my friends.

51:56.406 --> 51:58.742
Well, could you please
give me the address?

51:59.284 --> 52:01.161
Look, you can't come around anymore.

52:01.411 --> 52:03.971
And I don't want you hanging out
with Scooty anymore, you got it?

52:04.998 --> 52:05.999
I have to go.

52:16.384 --> 52:17.469
Yass!

52:17.552 --> 52:19.888
Hey, do you fucking see this shit?

52:24.851 --> 52:26.394
Come on. Come on.

52:26.686 --> 52:27.729
God!

52:28.021 --> 52:30.565
World star!

52:30.649 --> 52:31.858
How 'bout this?

52:32.442 --> 52:35.403
No more letting people
run over other people

52:35.487 --> 52:37.131
in the fucking parking lot.
How 'bout that?

52:37.155 --> 52:40.367
- Bobby, I didn't... I couldn't do anything.
- What's wrong with you?

52:40.450 --> 52:41.993
'Cause this, this can't be happening.

52:42.077 --> 52:45.205
I fucking knocked that
little fucker out. You fucking kiddin' me?

52:50.335 --> 52:52.254
Go run and get some waffles, baby.

52:53.546 --> 52:55.131
And where the fuck is Scooty?

53:08.395 --> 53:09.854
- Yo.
- Hi, Scooty.

53:09.938 --> 53:11.022
Hi, Halley.

53:11.106 --> 53:13.506
Moonee's gonna hit the pool,
does Scooty wanna come with her?

53:15.110 --> 53:17.362
Ashley doesn't think that's a good idea
right now, sorry.

53:17.445 --> 53:18.863
The fuck does that mean?

53:18.947 --> 53:20.240
Halley, calm down, calm down.

53:28.665 --> 53:30.333
Hi. Here you go.

53:31.835 --> 53:33.420
I want her to take my order.

53:36.589 --> 53:39.968
Oh, it's you.
Never seen you inside before.

53:41.678 --> 53:43.013
Okay. Hold on.

53:44.389 --> 53:45.389
Ashley.

53:51.563 --> 53:52.647
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

53:54.482 --> 53:57.319
- What do you want, Halley?
- What's going on?

53:58.695 --> 53:59.695
What do you mean?

53:59.904 --> 54:02.384
You've been telling my daughter
she ain't welcome here no more.

54:04.743 --> 54:09.873
Look, she can come in here,
but I can't keep giving out free food.

54:10.790 --> 54:12.208
Shit. You got in trouble?

54:12.292 --> 54:16.963
And I don't want Scooty hanging out
with her or that new kid from FutureLand.

54:18.006 --> 54:21.593
Okay. So you ain't get in trouble.
What's going on?

54:22.886 --> 54:25.221
Nothing. Nothing to discuss.

54:26.389 --> 54:28.600
- Really?
- Really.

54:31.102 --> 54:36.149
Yo! What type of service is that?
You gonna come take my order?

54:42.155 --> 54:47.369
Moonee, order whatever the fuck you want.
We're staying here all fucking day.

54:47.452 --> 54:53.792
Yes. I want strawberry waffles
with extra, extra warm syrup.

54:53.875 --> 54:57.837
And I want eggs, bacon, and strawberries.

54:57.921 --> 55:03.009
And blueberries. And Coke,
root beer, and lemonade. Sprite.

55:04.552 --> 55:05.552
You?

55:06.137 --> 55:09.391
You sure that's it? You could order more.
I told you, anything you want.

55:10.183 --> 55:12.394
I actually want extra bacon.

55:13.228 --> 55:14.813
Lots of bacon.

55:15.313 --> 55:19.651
- And fresh jelly. Don't forget that.
- You got all that?

55:20.068 --> 55:21.319
You got money to pay for this?

55:21.694 --> 55:23.780
Don't worry about my pockets. I got money.

55:24.155 --> 55:26.741
- Okay.
- And I got money, too!

55:28.743 --> 55:30.662
- Mmm!
- I have an idea.

55:30.745 --> 55:32.747
You wanna have a burping contest?

55:33.373 --> 55:36.668
- Are you serious?
- I know you wanna have a burping contest.

55:36.751 --> 55:38.336
- You go first.
- Okay.

55:47.762 --> 55:49.639
That was a good one.

55:49.722 --> 55:51.724
- You got another one?
- Yeah.

55:51.808 --> 55:53.309
Here it goes, here it goes...

55:59.566 --> 56:01.401
- Oh, my God.
- You try to burp.

56:04.863 --> 56:06.322
I want the rest to go.

56:14.789 --> 56:15.999
You gonna pack this up for me,

56:16.082 --> 56:18.482
or do I gotta tell Simone
what I feel about the service here?

56:21.504 --> 56:22.504
Yeah.

56:27.510 --> 56:29.304
Say hi to Scooty for me.

56:37.395 --> 56:39.564
Mom, why did you do that?

56:41.733 --> 56:44.736
Ah! I told you, you gotta spin it.

56:44.819 --> 56:48.031
- I am.
- No, no. Clockwise.

56:48.114 --> 56:50.200
- I am! This is clockwise.
- Oh, oh.

56:50.283 --> 56:52.285
- No. I guess counterclockwise.
- Jesus.

56:54.412 --> 56:55.412
Come on.

56:56.915 --> 56:57.915
Pull, pull, pull.

57:01.544 --> 57:03.296
- You gotta spin it.
- I am.

57:14.766 --> 57:17.060
By the way,
I told her happy birthday for you.

57:18.686 --> 57:20.188
- But I didn't.
- Come on, push.

57:20.271 --> 57:21.606
- But I didn't. I didn't.
- Push.

57:21.689 --> 57:23.441
Why'd you do that? Why would you do that?

57:25.318 --> 57:28.029
Now you call her and tell her I didn't.

57:28.696 --> 57:29.697
Come on, please.

57:29.781 --> 57:32.909
Hey. First...
First, you get her on the phone,

57:33.826 --> 57:35.906
and you tell her
I didn't wish her anything, damn it.

57:42.460 --> 57:43.586
Okay.

57:49.884 --> 57:52.011
You know what? Keep the money.

57:53.805 --> 57:54.847
- Keep it.
- No.

57:54.931 --> 57:57.850
- I thought you appreciated the extra work.
- Okay.

57:58.560 --> 58:00.979
No. It takes an hour and a half
just to drive here.

58:02.063 --> 58:04.691
You totally screwed up my Saturday.
I don't need the extra work.

58:06.234 --> 58:07.819
Give the money to him, he needs it.

58:08.778 --> 58:10.572
Or tell your boss to hire an extra hand.

58:13.658 --> 58:16.202
Please just take the money.
I really don't need it.

58:16.619 --> 58:18.913
I can't do this anymore. I'm done.

58:19.706 --> 58:24.419
Okay. But, just...
help me bring this downstairs.

58:27.672 --> 58:31.384
Come on. Finish what you started.

58:43.980 --> 58:45.773
- You gonna press the button?
- Oh, yeah.

58:50.987 --> 58:52.280
Fuck.

59:07.378 --> 59:09.797
This one smells really good.

59:11.716 --> 59:12.842
- No.
- No?

59:12.925 --> 59:13.925
No. Thank you.

59:13.968 --> 59:15.261
Okay, thank you.

59:15.345 --> 59:17.639
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh, fuck.

59:18.056 --> 59:21.267
Excuse me, lady. Hey!

59:22.727 --> 59:24.270
- Hey!
- We're leaving.

59:24.354 --> 59:26.514
- I need you guys to come back inside.
- We're leaving.

59:27.148 --> 59:28.816
- Do you hear me?
- We're leaving.

59:29.984 --> 59:30.984
Come on.

59:31.319 --> 59:33.519
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You were soliciting in our building.

59:33.571 --> 59:35.531
- You can't do that.
- You're not even a real cop.

59:35.573 --> 59:36.759
Hey, I'm just doing my job here, alright.

59:36.783 --> 59:38.510
You can't do that on our property.
I've already called the cops.

59:38.534 --> 59:39.845
You gotta go back inside with me.

59:39.869 --> 59:42.914
Get off your power trip.
You're riding a golf cart, okay?

59:42.997 --> 59:44.183
I need you to come back right now.

59:44.207 --> 59:45.887
If you're leaving,
I gotta confiscate that.

59:45.917 --> 59:47.085
I need you to... Gimme...

59:47.919 --> 59:48.979
- Fuck!
- Are you serious right now?

59:49.003 --> 59:50.546
You fucking bitch!

59:51.130 --> 59:52.256
Come back here!

59:53.883 --> 59:55.843
Why'd you let her have our perfume?

59:56.386 --> 59:57.970
It's complicated, baby.

59:58.388 --> 59:59.430
But why?

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.684
I can't get arrested again.

01:00:03.434 --> 01:00:05.144
Could we go for ice cream?

01:00:06.896 --> 01:00:08.898
You're walking too fast.

01:01:11.127 --> 01:01:12.879
I don't wanna watch this anymore.

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:15.631
- Where's the iPad?
- Sold.

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:18.801
- What?
- I had to sell it.

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:25.266
- Why?
- Whatever, Moonee, this room costs money.

01:01:27.685 --> 01:01:30.646
- You know I like pepperoni.
- Pepperoni costs money.

01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:37.403
Don't wipe that on the sheets.
Gotta sleep there.

01:01:37.987 --> 01:01:41.115
This is my pillow.
I can wipe my hands on my pillow.

01:01:44.285 --> 01:01:45.453
Are you gonna wash it then?

01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:50.333
I'll have Bertha wash it.

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:52.919
I'm not gonna explain it to you again.

01:01:53.753 --> 01:01:56.798
I ain't gonna let you, or anyone else,
establish residency.

01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.718
Don't think I think you're as dumb
as you want me to think.

01:02:02.178 --> 01:02:03.387
You're gonna screw me over.

01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:08.392
You don't wanna do this, you can go.
I'm serious.

01:02:09.894 --> 01:02:12.396
But who's gonna know if we even did this?

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.155
And I'm being straight with you.

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:23.866
You gotta settle up by Friday.

01:02:50.393 --> 01:02:51.435
Come on.

01:03:02.989 --> 01:03:03.990
Hey, April.

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:08.785
Come on, Moonee.

01:03:09.912 --> 01:03:12.456
- What are you taking pictures for?
- New policy.

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.959
Narek wants me to document the vacancy.

01:03:15.585 --> 01:03:16.669
Moonee, come on.

01:03:25.344 --> 01:03:28.723
Good night, ladies. See you in 24 hours.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.861
I'm right across 192 at The Magic Castle.

01:03:41.944 --> 01:03:44.155
I come here once a month,
and the rate's 35.

01:03:44.739 --> 01:03:46.991
Yes, well, our policy has changed.

01:03:47.074 --> 01:03:49.702
- You can't just change the policy.
- I certainly can.

01:03:50.077 --> 01:03:52.705
- Fuck this right now.
- What are you doing?

01:03:52.913 --> 01:03:53.956
Don't worry about me.

01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:56.143
- Who are you calling?
- Mind your business.

01:03:56.167 --> 01:03:58.210
- Can't you see I'm in charge here?
- I don't care.

01:03:59.795 --> 01:04:01.922
<i>- Hello. Bobby.</i>
- Hey, Bobby.

01:04:02.465 --> 01:04:07.762
These fuckos at The Arabian
are trying to charge me...

01:04:08.638 --> 01:04:11.223
- Forty-five.
- Forty-five bucks.

01:04:11.307 --> 01:04:13.100
Can you tell them it's 35?

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.770
<i>- Now that's not right.</i>
- Hey, listen, Bobby...

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:17.521
<i>- Where's Jimmy?</i>
- It's me, Jimmy, Bobby.

01:04:17.605 --> 01:04:18.790
We're not honoring the deal anymore.

01:04:18.814 --> 01:04:20.608
<i>- Hey, Jimmy, How's it going?</i>
- Yeah, good.

01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:22.360
- Hello?
<i>- Uh, who is this?</i>

01:04:22.443 --> 01:04:25.071
Any arrangements or deals you had
with the previous owner...

01:04:25.154 --> 01:04:27.073
Give us a break, lady!

01:04:27.156 --> 01:04:29.356
...are no longer being honored
or recognized. Thank you.

01:04:42.254 --> 01:04:45.591
We've had an agreement
in place for a while

01:04:45.883 --> 01:04:49.011
where we give a little break
to each other's...

01:04:49.095 --> 01:04:52.348
I'm well aware of the arrangement
you used to have.

01:04:52.682 --> 01:04:56.435
But as I have said five times now,
this is no longer being honored.

01:04:56.644 --> 01:04:59.244
We just went through with this whole thing
with The Enchanted Inn.

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:04.610
- Look, can't you make an exception?
- No.

01:05:05.695 --> 01:05:07.363
This is not up for discussion.

01:05:07.613 --> 01:05:08.864
You see what I'm saying, Bobby?

01:05:11.617 --> 01:05:13.369
Duh, lady! Duh!

01:05:17.957 --> 01:05:19.959
Magic Castle discount, there you go.

01:05:20.334 --> 01:05:22.086
- Excuse me.
- Aw, you're so sweet, Bobby.

01:05:22.169 --> 01:05:24.422
We don't need your business.
Please take your money.

01:05:24.505 --> 01:05:27.049
- What?
- All of you kindly leave, please.

01:05:27.133 --> 01:05:28.968
- Thank you.
- You can't do that.

01:05:29.385 --> 01:05:31.762
I have the 45. Are you fucking serious?

01:05:32.096 --> 01:05:33.764
Listen to you. And your child.

01:05:34.223 --> 01:05:36.142
No wonder you're in this situation.

01:05:36.559 --> 01:05:39.478
Please leave the property.
Right now. Leave.

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:45.443
- What is wrong with you?
- Hey, come on.

01:05:45.526 --> 01:05:47.528
Are you crazy out of mind?

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:52.074
You better come back here and clean
this up. Come back here.

01:05:52.158 --> 01:05:53.284
Fuck you.

01:05:53.826 --> 01:05:55.828
Do not ever come back to this property!

01:06:18.934 --> 01:06:22.438
Damn, girl.
This shit looks fucking fancy in here.

01:06:22.521 --> 01:06:23.856
Thank you, thank you.

01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:27.067
How do you got it like that?
You an interior decorator or some shit?

01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:29.653
Shit is mad cozy.

01:06:30.613 --> 01:06:32.323
- Guys, you want cheesies?
- Yeah.

01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:34.283
- Yeah?
- What's that big thing over there?

01:06:34.366 --> 01:06:35.618
That's a turkey roaster.

01:06:35.701 --> 01:06:37.787
What the fuck is it,
Thanksgiving over here?

01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:40.164
You got some cranberry sauce too? Shit.

01:06:40.247 --> 01:06:44.210
I make some things, but Lunchables
are like one dollar, you know?

01:06:44.293 --> 01:06:46.462
Grandma, can they sleep
over here every night?

01:06:46.545 --> 01:06:50.174
- Yeah. You trying to cook us dinner.
- Oh, I don't know about every night.

01:06:50.257 --> 01:06:53.177
- Why not?
- We can sleep together like a big family.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.094
Yeah!

01:06:54.178 --> 01:06:55.906
I'll pull out a mattress
on the floor or something like that,

01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:57.330
but y'all ain't sleeping in my bed.

01:06:57.598 --> 01:07:01.852
No, you sleep on this side.
And I'll sleep on that side.

01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:04.396
This is gonna be
the funnest sleepover over.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.564
Yeah!

01:07:05.648 --> 01:07:09.026
Since it's bedtime, can we finally go
fucking smoke a blunt outside?

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:38.305
Can you tie me up?

01:07:39.849 --> 01:07:41.308
Are we going swimming?

01:07:41.559 --> 01:07:46.105
- No, we're gonna take swimsuit selfies.
- Swimsuit selfies!

01:07:47.147 --> 01:07:49.567
Okay, ready? Let's take a selfie.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.409
Stick your tongue out.

01:08:01.245 --> 01:08:02.245
Cute.

01:08:02.288 --> 01:08:04.206
Tell me how to look pretty, Moonee.

01:08:05.082 --> 01:08:06.166
Wait. Hold on.

01:08:09.253 --> 01:08:11.046
My turn!

01:08:11.505 --> 01:08:13.173
Get out there and take a picture of me.

01:08:17.469 --> 01:08:18.554
Perfect.

01:08:23.642 --> 01:08:26.562
Plip, plop, plip, plop.

01:08:31.734 --> 01:08:35.821
It's going to be a big surprise! And...

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:39.073
- Open!
- Whoa!

01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:42.077
At the end of the rainbow is gold!

01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:45.997
I know, but a leprechaun
is on the end with the gold.

01:08:46.332 --> 01:08:47.957
And it wouldn't let us keep it.

01:08:48.876 --> 01:08:50.836
I wish that leprechaun was nice.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.296
Let's go beat it up. Come on!

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:06.810
Hmm.

01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:12.316
Hey. This Slinky is old.

01:09:15.277 --> 01:09:16.277
Whoa!

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:19.823
<i>Hip-hop.
That's the way we do it.</i>

01:09:19.907 --> 01:09:23.827
<i>Power 95.3, Orlando's number one
for commercial free hip-hop.</i>

01:09:24.536 --> 01:09:26.663
Sorry to interrupt.

01:09:27.288 --> 01:09:30.459
I just wanted to pay you
for the week, sir.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:33.127
- It's good.
- Duh.

01:09:56.777 --> 01:09:59.655
- Hi!
- Hi, Bobby!

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:01.740
Hi, bossy guy.

01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:05.703
Good kids. Most of the time.

01:10:09.581 --> 01:10:10.666
- Bobby.
- Yeah.

01:10:10.749 --> 01:10:12.418
- Come here.
- Yup.

01:10:14.128 --> 01:10:16.672
Okay. See? This is all finable.

01:10:16.922 --> 01:10:18.966
- What?
- These bikes blocking the walkway.

01:10:19.049 --> 01:10:20.217
Okay. Okay.

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.428
- You have to make a flyer.
- All right.

01:10:22.511 --> 01:10:25.639
It has to say, "Please move your bikes
and lock them in the back."

01:10:25.723 --> 01:10:26.932
Okay. Uh, in the...

01:10:27.016 --> 01:10:28.017
- Okay?
- Way in the back?

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.101
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:10:29.727 --> 01:10:32.104
Give them one week deadline,
otherwise we'll cut them off.

01:10:32.187 --> 01:10:34.398
- Okay. All right.
- "Thank you, Management."

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.745
Soap in my eyes.

01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:56.128
Let me wash my hair again
without this soap in my eye.

01:10:58.839 --> 01:11:00.716
I'm gonna cook lasagna!

01:11:00.799 --> 01:11:04.094
- What are you gonna cook?
- I'm gonna cook alien food!

01:11:04.178 --> 01:11:06.305
Yeah!

01:11:06.597 --> 01:11:09.683
Here you go, aliens! Eat it up!

01:11:31.955 --> 01:11:33.707
You're a good hummer, Jancey.

01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:39.004
Oh, wait.

01:11:39.338 --> 01:11:41.799
- Mommy, look at us.
- Girls, we got one.

01:11:42.382 --> 01:11:43.382
Yes!

01:11:44.384 --> 01:11:46.136
We're just going straight. Is that okay?

01:12:03.946 --> 01:12:06.156
- You ready, Jancey?
- Can I put it in?

01:12:07.032 --> 01:12:09.201
- It's on.
- Be careful, 'cause it has fire.

01:12:10.244 --> 01:12:11.453
Don't want you to get burned.

01:12:29.972 --> 01:12:31.849
Make a wish, big girl.

01:12:34.768 --> 01:12:36.061
Whoa!

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:44.903
- Happy birthday, Jancey!
- Whoa!

01:12:44.987 --> 01:12:46.905
- That's for you.
- I love it!

01:12:47.239 --> 01:12:48.949
Whoa.

01:12:52.452 --> 01:12:53.954
Halley, save us, 'cause I don't...

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:56.373
- Did you make your birthday wish?
- Yeah.

01:13:07.342 --> 01:13:08.343
Okay.

01:13:41.877 --> 01:13:43.462
- Oh, come on.
<i>- Hola.</i>

01:13:43.795 --> 01:13:46.298
Come on. Pardon me.

01:13:46.381 --> 01:13:48.592
Excuse me. Pardon me.

01:13:48.675 --> 01:13:51.470
- Excuse me, pardon me.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

01:13:51.553 --> 01:13:53.555
- Come on, ladies.
- Excuse me, dude.

01:14:16.245 --> 01:14:18.163
- Get it, get it, get it.
- It's hard, Moonee.

01:14:18.664 --> 01:14:20.415
- What?
- It's really hard, Moonee.

01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:23.293
- Yeah, I know.
- Hey. Wait a minute.

01:14:23.377 --> 01:14:24.711
I didn't get jelly.

01:14:25.212 --> 01:14:26.505
Tricky jar.

01:14:27.422 --> 01:14:31.385
- Tricky, tricky. Tricky, tricky...
- Tricky jar.

01:14:32.261 --> 01:14:35.222
- Wiggly, wiggly.
- Well, here you go.

01:14:35.305 --> 01:14:36.431
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

01:14:36.515 --> 01:14:37.808
Thank you!

01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:42.270
Mm.

01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:54.825
Kind of like that, don't ya?

01:14:57.369 --> 01:14:59.830
This is the best jelly I ever eaten.

01:15:01.581 --> 01:15:05.502
Do you know... Do you know why
this is my favorite tree?

01:15:05.585 --> 01:15:06.585
Why?

01:15:08.005 --> 01:15:09.339
'Cause it tipped over.

01:15:11.758 --> 01:15:13.176
And it's still growing.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.970
That's pretty cool.

01:15:15.512 --> 01:15:16.512
Mm-hmm.

01:15:35.991 --> 01:15:37.159
All yours, Scooty.

01:15:37.242 --> 01:15:38.869
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey.

01:15:53.675 --> 01:15:56.803
Ashley, have you been spotting Halley
on the rent?

01:15:57.346 --> 01:16:01.308
What? Why would I do that?
I don't even talk to that bitch.

01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:04.519
- Okay. Thanks. Have a nice swim.
- Thank you.

01:16:10.442 --> 01:16:12.194
Can I go swimming with Scooty?

01:16:13.653 --> 01:16:15.906
You're not going swimming
while that bitch is down there.

01:16:26.166 --> 01:16:27.709
Why can't I?

01:16:31.338 --> 01:16:32.964
Tickle monster.

01:16:37.594 --> 01:16:39.346
Moonee, get ready for a bath, okay?

01:16:41.973 --> 01:16:43.392
What kind of car you driving?

01:16:45.352 --> 01:16:47.771
All right. Room 323, babe.

01:17:10.585 --> 01:17:12.671
Oh. Hey, there's a kid in here.

01:17:12.754 --> 01:17:14.714
Dude, I told you
the bathroom was off-limits.

01:17:14.798 --> 01:17:16.341
- I had to piss.
- Out.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.653
- Pull the curtain, Moon.
- You have a fucking kid in here?

01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:20.095
Whatever. Out.

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:22.639
Moon, I'll be right back, okay?

01:17:24.808 --> 01:17:27.394
<i>...Orlando's
number one for commercial free hip-hop.</i>

01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:51.501
Do I look like a ticket scammer?

01:17:51.585 --> 01:17:53.438
I don't know.
What does a ticket scammer look like?

01:17:53.462 --> 01:17:55.064
- I'm just not interested.
- Not like me, though.

01:17:55.088 --> 01:17:56.298
If I was scamming tickets,

01:17:56.381 --> 01:17:59.509
I would not be coming in here with
my daughter, trying to give you a deal.

01:18:05.682 --> 01:18:07.392
- Hey, you going in there?
- Yeah.

01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:10.854
Don't buy from those places.
They'll rope you into buying timeshares.

01:18:10.937 --> 01:18:12.939
- I got some I'm trying to sell.
- Ah. No, thanks.

01:18:13.023 --> 01:18:16.151
Dude! They'll make you do a two-hour tour
and hard sell you.

01:18:16.234 --> 01:18:18.153
You really wanna do that shit
on your vacation?

01:18:18.987 --> 01:18:20.614
You're selling ticket bands?

01:18:20.697 --> 01:18:23.575
Well, I have four. They're 164 per day.

01:18:23.658 --> 01:18:27.704
So that's, like, $600 in cash.
I could do... $400.

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:30.707
And these still work, no tricks?

01:18:31.041 --> 01:18:32.417
They're completely unused.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:35.879
My family had to cancel our vacation,
and they don't give out refunds.

01:18:35.962 --> 01:18:37.602
But they're totally unused, they'll work.

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:41.718
Look, I'll even come with you to the front
gate or whatever so you know I'm for real.

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:44.596
- And these are Park Hoppers, yeah?
- Of course!

01:18:45.847 --> 01:18:48.642
All right. Should we say
350 for the four, then?

01:18:49.017 --> 01:18:50.227
- Cash?
- Yeah.

01:18:51.978 --> 01:18:54.606
Lowest I can do is 400. That's a steal.

01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:58.568
- All right.
- Thanks.

01:18:59.653 --> 01:19:00.820
Give him the bands, Moon.

01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:03.031
Give the man the bands.

01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:04.783
- Have a great time.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.535
Thank you. Come on, baby.

01:19:07.536 --> 01:19:10.664
Whoo!

01:19:13.124 --> 01:19:15.043
Oh, look, look.

01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:17.546
That one's beautiful!

01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:18.629
I want that one.

01:19:19.589 --> 01:19:22.884
- We can give Jancey one.
- Let's buy it. Give me that.

01:19:22.968 --> 01:19:24.469
- Look at what else they have.
- Hey!

01:19:24.553 --> 01:19:26.096
- Cotton balls?
- Yeah.

01:19:26.179 --> 01:19:27.055
Okay.

01:19:27.138 --> 01:19:28.598
Toys!

01:19:28.682 --> 01:19:30.850
Seriously, girlfriend?

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:34.729
- Money. I'm rich. I'm rich.
- You got money!

01:19:41.152 --> 01:19:42.696
Look, there's a flute!

01:19:52.372 --> 01:19:54.291
Yeah!

01:19:56.376 --> 01:19:58.503
- Back in the workforce?
- Say what?

01:19:59.629 --> 01:20:01.089
- New job?
- Yeah!

01:20:02.424 --> 01:20:03.592
Interesting hours.

01:20:04.259 --> 01:20:05.259
What?

01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:11.558
One, I see you dressed in PJs
all day, every day.

01:20:11.641 --> 01:20:13.143
Am I wearing PJs now?

01:20:13.226 --> 01:20:16.980
Two, if you're working,
who's looking after Moonee?

01:20:18.732 --> 01:20:20.609
Mind your own business, bro.

01:20:21.318 --> 01:20:23.612
Get that stolen cart off the property.

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:35.915
Yeah?

01:20:36.207 --> 01:20:37.417
Who is it?

01:20:43.882 --> 01:20:45.634
Go away, asshole,

01:20:45.717 --> 01:20:47.302
or I'm gonna call the cops.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.096
Why you calling the cops?

01:20:54.476 --> 01:20:56.227
I'm not going away.

01:20:57.228 --> 01:20:58.688
Mom, who's outside?

01:20:58.772 --> 01:21:00.440
Nobody, baby. Don't worry about it.

01:21:06.613 --> 01:21:07.697
Hey, hey!

01:21:08.156 --> 01:21:10.176
- Hey, what's going on?
- It's none of your business, bro.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.370
It is my business. I'm the manager here.
What's going on?

01:21:13.453 --> 01:21:15.955
Okay, yeah. The girl in there,
she's got something of mine.

01:21:16.039 --> 01:21:17.290
I... I want it back.

01:21:17.499 --> 01:21:19.167
- The six-year-old?
- The...

01:21:19.584 --> 01:21:20.919
No, man. The mom.

01:21:26.049 --> 01:21:29.302
Halley, it's Bobby.
We got a situation here. Open up.

01:21:33.056 --> 01:21:36.643
- Yeah?
- This guy says you have something of his.

01:21:36.935 --> 01:21:39.813
- I don't know who this guy is.
- She doesn't know who you are.

01:21:40.105 --> 01:21:42.691
You got the wrong girl.
We gotta talk, now.

01:21:43.233 --> 01:21:46.152
You know, you gotta leave the premises
if you're not staying here.

01:21:46.236 --> 01:21:48.822
I'm not going anywhere
without my four MagicBands, okay?

01:21:48.905 --> 01:21:51.574
She went in my bag,
she took four fucking MagicBands.

01:21:51.866 --> 01:21:54.452
What the fuck is a magical band?

01:21:54.536 --> 01:21:56.256
I don't know what this guy
is talking about.

01:21:56.329 --> 01:21:57.807
She don't know what you're talking about.

01:21:57.831 --> 01:22:00.250
She went in my stuff,
she lifted four fucking bands.

01:22:00.333 --> 01:22:02.520
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- She don't know what you're talking...

01:22:02.544 --> 01:22:04.003
You do know what I'm talking about.

01:22:04.129 --> 01:22:07.090
Okay? I want them back now. That's $1700.
That's grand larceny, bitch.

01:22:07.173 --> 01:22:08.341
Hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy.

01:22:09.718 --> 01:22:12.929
I'm happy to call the cops right now,
and we can fill out a report.

01:22:13.763 --> 01:22:17.100
And you can tell them
what your business was on the premises.

01:22:17.934 --> 01:22:19.018
Four bracelets?

01:22:20.228 --> 01:22:23.273
I imagine they were for your wife
and children, yeah?

01:22:28.528 --> 01:22:31.823
I suggest you leave
the premises right now.

01:22:37.996 --> 01:22:39.748
This isn't a premises,
it's a fucking dump.

01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:42.834
About time you make yourself useful.

01:22:49.007 --> 01:22:50.467
Did he have to pee again?

01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:51.718
Don't worry about it, Moon.

01:23:08.318 --> 01:23:09.318
What now?

01:23:09.611 --> 01:23:13.823
From now on, all visitors are required
to check in at the front desk. Got it?

01:23:13.907 --> 01:23:14.741
What?

01:23:14.824 --> 01:23:18.453
You have a guest, they check in with me
at the front office.

01:23:18.536 --> 01:23:21.456
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- You heard me.

01:23:21.539 --> 01:23:23.124
Get back inside, Moonee.

01:23:23.208 --> 01:23:25.710
When I say register, I'm talking about ID.

01:23:25.794 --> 01:23:28.546
They gotta leave the ID right there,
with me, in the office.

01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:32.008
You can't just not let me have guests.
What gives you the authority?

01:23:32.091 --> 01:23:35.553
What? The authority?
Uh, my job title: manager.

01:23:35.929 --> 01:23:38.932
- I have friends though.
- Hey, watch those glasses on the walkway.

01:23:39.015 --> 01:23:41.351
Yeah. We all got friends.
We all got friends.

01:23:41.434 --> 01:23:44.145
But this is a special rule for you.

01:23:45.688 --> 01:23:46.815
Okay. But, Bobby...

01:23:46.898 --> 01:23:50.652
I do follow rules. Just 'cause they're not
your rules doesn't mean anything.

01:23:50.735 --> 01:23:54.572
No, they... They're the company's rules.
They're the motel's rules.

01:23:54.656 --> 01:23:56.592
- That's the way it is. I'm a very fair...
- Fuck you looking at, Tina?

01:23:56.616 --> 01:23:57.951
- Hey!
- Don't listen, don't...

01:23:58.034 --> 01:24:00.954
- Hey, people are leaving.
- You're not my fucking father.

01:24:01.037 --> 01:24:04.082
- I don't wanna be your father.
- You can't fucking treat me like this.

01:24:04.165 --> 01:24:07.085
- This isn't a fucking jail.
- Listen... Hey! Calm down!

01:24:07.168 --> 01:24:08.711
- Calm down!
- This isn't a jail!

01:24:08.795 --> 01:24:10.689
- No, no. It's a place where people live.
- You're gonna chase my friends away?

01:24:10.713 --> 01:24:13.317
- And you gotta... You gotta calm down.
- That's a fucking invasion of privacy.

01:24:13.341 --> 01:24:15.343
It's like the fucking
Fifth Amendment or something.

01:24:15.426 --> 01:24:17.321
- I've had it. That's it! That's it!
- You can't fucking do that.

01:24:17.345 --> 01:24:19.722
- That's it!
- Who do you think you are, Bobby Big Shot?

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:25.228
Fuck you, Bobby!
I don't have to listen to you!

01:24:25.311 --> 01:24:26.311
Out!

01:24:27.772 --> 01:24:30.483
I want you out of this lobby!
I'm gonna count to three.

01:24:30.567 --> 01:24:34.529
And if you don't leave this lobby,
you're out of here tonight!

01:24:35.905 --> 01:24:36.905
One.

01:24:37.991 --> 01:24:38.991
Two.

01:24:40.201 --> 01:24:41.619
Three!

01:24:47.125 --> 01:24:49.168
Oh. Nice!

01:24:51.129 --> 01:24:53.798
Moonee, why'd you take me
on this adventure?

01:24:53.882 --> 01:24:57.969
- I didn't know it was going to rain.
- Did you not even watch the news?

01:24:58.052 --> 01:25:01.014
I never watch the news. It's so boring!

01:25:01.097 --> 01:25:03.808
I watch the news. It's not that boring.

01:25:27.123 --> 01:25:29.876
- Whoo!
- Careful of the pooey.

01:25:31.753 --> 01:25:35.465
See, I took you on a safari.

01:25:56.319 --> 01:25:58.738
Hey. These two are still busted,

01:25:58.821 --> 01:26:00.949
but I'll be done with that one
in like two minutes.

01:26:03.952 --> 01:26:04.952
Okay.

01:26:27.934 --> 01:26:29.185
Mom, it's Halley.

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:37.859
- Hey.
- What?

01:26:41.823 --> 01:26:45.868
I know Moonee probably did some shit,
and I'm sorry about that.

01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:51.708
But I don't think that shit should,
you know, affect us.

01:26:51.791 --> 01:26:53.167
You know, they're kids.

01:26:54.252 --> 01:26:55.252
Is that it?

01:26:57.130 --> 01:26:58.172
Yeah, well...

01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:02.677
Could you spot me my rent this week?
I'm maxed out.

01:27:02.927 --> 01:27:04.887
What?

01:27:07.849 --> 01:27:09.517
I think you got that covered.

01:27:10.309 --> 01:27:11.519
What are you talking about?

01:27:13.146 --> 01:27:17.608
You don't think everybody knows
what's up, Halley? Like, everybody.

01:27:18.067 --> 01:27:20.403
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:27:20.737 --> 01:27:22.405
Bitch...

01:27:26.242 --> 01:27:29.704
<i>Seems pretty clear to me.
Step aside, soldier!</i>

01:27:31.456 --> 01:27:34.292
- That's you.
- That's not me.

01:27:37.879 --> 01:27:41.424
Those are your tats, bitch.
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:27:42.216 --> 01:27:47.305
And I swear to God, if Scooty was ever
in the room while you were whoring off,

01:27:47.388 --> 01:27:48.931
I'll fucking kill you.

01:27:52.685 --> 01:27:53.978
- Fuck you, bitch!
- No!

01:27:54.062 --> 01:27:55.063
Get the fuck outta here.

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.706
Mom, are you okay?

01:28:17.335 --> 01:28:18.461
Mom?

01:28:22.548 --> 01:28:24.759
Uh, are you okay, Mom?

01:28:33.309 --> 01:28:35.978
You're not going to like it.
Because guess what?

01:28:36.062 --> 01:28:38.606
- What?
- No fun stuff in the classroom.

01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:41.567
I heard in school you get recess.

01:28:41.651 --> 01:28:46.239
And recess is fun. You get to go outside,
you get on the playground, it's fun.

01:28:46.322 --> 01:28:49.534
It's just recess! Nothing else!

01:29:06.008 --> 01:29:08.344
Well, my grandma sometimes
does that to me,

01:29:08.427 --> 01:29:10.388
but I trick her that I fall asleep.

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:14.767
- But then I just wake up...
- I think something's happening at my room.

01:29:17.645 --> 01:29:20.022
Did Ashley fucking call DCF on me?

01:29:20.106 --> 01:29:22.150
Ma'am, we got a call,
and it doesn't matter who...

01:29:22.233 --> 01:29:24.735
From who? Who the fuck called you then?

01:29:24.819 --> 01:29:26.195
- Ma'am...
- Who called you?

01:29:26.279 --> 01:29:27.589
- We were called to investigate.
- Who called you?

01:29:27.613 --> 01:29:30.074
You fucking tell me who called,
and I'll tell you why.

01:29:30.491 --> 01:29:32.952
If it was Ashley, she's hype
'cause I fucking beat her ass.

01:29:33.035 --> 01:29:34.120
Girls.

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:38.207
Don't fucking touch me.
Don't ask me questions.

01:29:38.291 --> 01:29:40.168
- I don't fucking want...
- Listen to me.

01:29:40.668 --> 01:29:41.668
Uh...

01:29:42.128 --> 01:29:44.755
- You wait right here, okay?
- Why is my mom yelling?

01:29:45.214 --> 01:29:48.426
Uh, she's just talking to these ladies.
Jancey, you go home.

01:29:48.509 --> 01:29:49.427
- You go home now.
- Okay.

01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:50.928
- Bye, Moonee.
- Bye.

01:29:51.012 --> 01:29:52.847
You're not coming into my fucking place.

01:29:53.556 --> 01:29:55.183
I'm not doing anything wrong.

01:29:55.266 --> 01:29:57.476
You're literally coming onto
my fucking property.

01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:58.895
You're not coming into my room.

01:29:58.978 --> 01:30:01.397
You don't have a fucking court order.
Let me see paperwork.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.274
So then can you help us
so that we can go...

01:30:03.357 --> 01:30:05.067
Can I help you about what?

01:30:05.151 --> 01:30:06.527
Why's my mom upset?

01:30:06.944 --> 01:30:08.696
You know, I don't know, but, uh...

01:30:08.779 --> 01:30:10.899
They're just talking.
They gotta figure something out.

01:30:11.115 --> 01:30:14.577
What are... What do they have to
figure anything out with?

01:30:14.827 --> 01:30:19.999
Um, I don't know. It's some sort
of confusion. But it'll be fine. Okay?

01:30:20.958 --> 01:30:22.043
- Mom!
- Uh...

01:30:23.336 --> 01:30:25.096
You're doing this
in front of my fucking kid?

01:30:36.307 --> 01:30:38.184
Can I go back to my room now?

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.102
In a little bit.

01:30:40.770 --> 01:30:42.480
- A couple minutes, okay?
- Yup.

01:30:45.233 --> 01:30:47.526
Just... Just... Moonee.

01:30:49.195 --> 01:30:52.448
Talk to the lady.
She's just got some questions for you,

01:30:52.531 --> 01:30:54.867
and then you can go back to your room.
All right?

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.520
Can you tell me what kind of stuff
you do every day, Moonee?

01:31:04.043 --> 01:31:05.670
Do you ever go swimming in the pool?

01:31:07.463 --> 01:31:08.463
Yeah?

01:31:10.633 --> 01:31:13.233
What else? What kind of stuff do you like
to do with your friends?

01:32:08.232 --> 01:32:09.859
What's going on?

01:32:11.277 --> 01:32:13.112
Nothing, baby. Go back to bed.

01:33:00.534 --> 01:33:03.871
- Whatcha doin' all wet, Mom?
- Nothing.

01:33:09.502 --> 01:33:10.795
<i>Come here.</i>

01:33:22.181 --> 01:33:23.307
Tag, you're it.

01:33:26.227 --> 01:33:27.645
It's very good.

01:33:28.771 --> 01:33:30.731
Tickle monster!

01:33:31.065 --> 01:33:34.151
I'm the tickle monster!

01:33:44.495 --> 01:33:47.581
If there are any boxes over there
that are less than half-full,

01:33:47.665 --> 01:33:49.208
throw them out, okay?

01:33:50.084 --> 01:33:51.127
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:52.753 --> 01:33:54.004
Ooh, ooh.

01:33:54.713 --> 01:33:55.713
- Ooh-ooh.
- Ooh-ooh.

01:33:55.756 --> 01:33:57.633
Girl, those are from the outside.

01:33:57.716 --> 01:34:01.095
Your grubby little fingers
trying to unlock this window.

01:34:01.679 --> 01:34:03.180
You better clean that.

01:34:10.354 --> 01:34:11.514
Don't do that, don't do that.

01:34:11.814 --> 01:34:14.608
If DCF has a fucking problem
with that, eff them.

01:34:14.775 --> 01:34:15.775
What?

01:34:16.026 --> 01:34:18.571
Dirty.

01:34:20.489 --> 01:34:22.450
You better clean up those underpants.

01:34:22.783 --> 01:34:24.618
Thank you.

01:34:30.499 --> 01:34:32.585
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:34:32.793 --> 01:34:34.211
- What's up?
- You need towels?

01:34:34.795 --> 01:34:35.796
No.

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:40.801
- Hmm. Sometime, a little bit.
- I have a present for you.

01:34:41.343 --> 01:34:43.762
This is for you,
but make sure you smoke all of it.

01:34:44.138 --> 01:34:46.432
- Like, all of it.
- Yes.

01:34:47.224 --> 01:34:48.642
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:34:50.728 --> 01:34:52.062
Enjoy that shit, girl.

01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:53.730
Thank you. Hey!

01:34:55.316 --> 01:34:57.818
And don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

01:34:58.903 --> 01:35:00.488
I promise. It's gonna be okay.

01:35:22.718 --> 01:35:26.472
- I don't know why we just, like...
- Just look at them.

01:35:27.681 --> 01:35:28.766
Okay.

01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:33.771
What's your...
What's your favorite thing to watch on TV?

01:35:38.192 --> 01:35:41.362
Boys. Good morning.

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.115
Yeah. You gotta go home.

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.577
There's cars coming through here.
We got guests.

01:35:52.831 --> 01:35:54.208
No harm, no foul.

01:35:55.042 --> 01:35:56.043
"No foul."

01:35:56.794 --> 01:35:58.629
There's a joke in there somewhere.

01:35:59.797 --> 01:36:00.923
All right, fellas.

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:05.010
All right. Have a good day.

01:36:46.218 --> 01:36:47.970
Wow!

01:36:50.055 --> 01:36:53.726
- Moonee, come get a plate.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:36:54.226 --> 01:36:57.187
Mm... Good.

01:36:59.023 --> 01:37:02.818
I'm going to eat a strawberry
and a raspberry at the same time.

01:37:11.619 --> 01:37:13.454
Man, oh, man, that's gross.

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.541
I wish they made forks out of candy.

01:37:22.046 --> 01:37:24.965
Then you could eat the fork
after your meal.

01:37:33.724 --> 01:37:35.017
I love this.

01:37:41.899 --> 01:37:42.941
Ahh!

01:37:43.525 --> 01:37:46.153
Oh, I feel like I'm going to burp.

01:37:48.614 --> 01:37:50.366
Wish I had a bigger stomach.

01:37:50.824 --> 01:37:51.867
Like I was pregnant.

01:37:52.576 --> 01:37:54.161
I'd fit food in there.

01:37:57.539 --> 01:37:59.166
We gotta come here again.

01:38:02.378 --> 01:38:03.962
This is the life, man.

01:38:04.588 --> 01:38:06.423
Better than a cruise.

01:38:07.466 --> 01:38:09.051
I mean, there's...

01:38:09.343 --> 01:38:12.346
There's not a cruise
made out of all this food.

01:38:12.429 --> 01:38:13.889
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

01:38:13.972 --> 01:38:15.412
May I have your room number, please?

01:38:15.641 --> 01:38:18.727
- 323.
- Thank you. Have a great stay.

01:38:20.437 --> 01:38:22.277
Excuse me,
can I have your room number, please?

01:38:31.407 --> 01:38:34.201
Hi, there. I need to speak
with the manager, please.

01:38:34.410 --> 01:38:35.494
Bobby...

01:38:37.246 --> 01:38:38.246
I know.

01:39:11.196 --> 01:39:12.614
Mom, what's going on?

01:39:13.615 --> 01:39:16.160
- It's okay, baby.
- What's okay?

01:39:25.836 --> 01:39:28.213
That's actually what we have
in our paperwork.

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:29.380
Oh, okay.

01:39:31.592 --> 01:39:32.968
- Excuse me.
- Hi, Halley.

01:39:33.051 --> 01:39:34.636
- Thank you.
- Hi, Moonee.

01:39:41.727 --> 01:39:42.728
Can I help you?

01:39:42.811 --> 01:39:46.106
Halley, these DCF officers
are here in regards to Moonee.

01:39:47.441 --> 01:39:49.485
You wanna inspect my room, be my guest.

01:39:52.738 --> 01:39:54.740
You wanna shake my boxes?

01:39:54.823 --> 01:39:56.325
You wanna look inside my fridge?

01:40:01.038 --> 01:40:03.499
- Halley.
- What?

01:40:03.582 --> 01:40:04.708
We have security footage

01:40:04.792 --> 01:40:07.503
showing nine different men
entering and exiting your room.

01:40:07.586 --> 01:40:12.257
Why don't you take Moonee outside
so we can talk to Halley privately?

01:40:13.175 --> 01:40:15.552
- What's going on?
- Um...

01:40:17.179 --> 01:40:20.557
Well, you know what? We just wanna
make sure that you're safe, okay?

01:40:20.933 --> 01:40:23.435
We've also obtained
this online classified ad

01:40:23.519 --> 01:40:25.813
soliciting customers for sexual activities

01:40:25.896 --> 01:40:27.439
with your phone number attached.

01:40:27.523 --> 01:40:30.818
Well, you're gonna go somewhere
really fun, and we're gonna have toys...

01:40:30.901 --> 01:40:32.361
But how many days?

01:40:32.611 --> 01:40:35.989
- It'll only be temporary, okay?
- What's temporary?

01:40:36.073 --> 01:40:38.575
Temporary means
just for a little bit of time.

01:40:39.243 --> 01:40:42.830
- Can we do that?
- I guess so.

01:40:42.913 --> 01:40:45.916
Okay. Thank you. You're such a big girl.
You know that?

01:40:46.667 --> 01:40:47.543
No.

01:40:47.626 --> 01:40:50.355
...that's able to take her. But luckily,
we have a family in Polk County

01:40:50.379 --> 01:40:53.257
that can take her for the entire course
of the investigation. Okay?

01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:55.634
Could I say goodbye to my friend Scooty?

01:40:56.343 --> 01:40:59.096
- Uh...
- He's down in 223.

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:01.473
We just need to check
to see if that's okay.

01:41:02.224 --> 01:41:04.518
She wants to say goodbye
to her friend Scooty.

01:41:04.601 --> 01:41:07.121
- It's okay for her to say goodbye, right?
- I'll take her down.

01:41:07.563 --> 01:41:11.066
We don't say goodbye.
But you could give your friend a hug.

01:41:11.483 --> 01:41:14.069
And you'll see them real soon. Okay?

01:41:15.112 --> 01:41:17.281
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go. Come on.

01:41:17.364 --> 01:41:19.926
My colleague's gonna take Moonee
downstairs to say goodbye to her friend.

01:41:19.950 --> 01:41:22.887
And in the meantime, it'd be great if you
could pack a bag with necessities.

01:41:22.911 --> 01:41:24.538
Also, maybe a favorite doll or toy.

01:41:56.528 --> 01:41:57.362
Yes?

01:41:57.446 --> 01:42:00.657
Hello, miss. My name is Susan Watson.
I'm with DCF.

01:42:01.158 --> 01:42:01.992
We have a quick favor to ask...

01:42:02.075 --> 01:42:04.536
Ashley, what happened to your face?

01:42:08.999 --> 01:42:13.754
...little cinnamon on it. The right
temperature, take your breath away.

01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:17.549
Okay. We can do a hug or a high-five.

01:42:17.883 --> 01:42:20.886
- Come here, Moonee.
- Thank you so much.

01:42:22.846 --> 01:42:25.265
- I hope your eye feels better.
- Thank you, babe.

01:42:26.683 --> 01:42:29.144
All right. Thank you so much. Okay?

01:42:29.227 --> 01:42:31.521
My mom said you're going
to another family.

01:42:31.605 --> 01:42:32.481
- Scooty.
- What?

01:42:32.564 --> 01:42:33.564
Thank you.

01:42:34.358 --> 01:42:36.985
Why did he say
I was going to another family?

01:42:37.069 --> 01:42:39.589
You're just gonna go live with a family
just for a little while.

01:42:47.037 --> 01:42:50.248
- Just temporary, okay?
- Moonee, we're going to your room, okay?

01:42:50.791 --> 01:42:51.917
Okay.

01:42:54.211 --> 01:42:55.253
Watch the steps.

01:43:02.594 --> 01:43:05.180
Are those cops going to take my mom away?

01:43:05.555 --> 01:43:08.433
- No, they're not.
- Are they gonna take me to another family?

01:43:08.517 --> 01:43:11.478
I'm gonna take you to a nice family
where you're gonna be okay,

01:43:11.561 --> 01:43:12.956
just for a little while. Is that okay?

01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:14.481
- Well, I don't want to.
- Moonee.

01:43:14.564 --> 01:43:16.650
- I don't want to go.
- Moonee, I know.

01:43:25.242 --> 01:43:26.469
- Moonee, will you please listen?
- Stop.

01:43:26.493 --> 01:43:27.929
- Honey, your mom knows all about it.
- Stop!

01:43:27.953 --> 01:43:29.204
Your mom said it was okay.

01:43:42.467 --> 01:43:45.804
- Do you want me to get super angry?
- No, I don't. That's why...

01:43:46.763 --> 01:43:50.517
Hey, I'm gonna... fix those machines
by the end of the week.

01:43:52.394 --> 01:43:53.394
Okay.

01:43:55.897 --> 01:43:57.583
- Would you please go get her parent?
- Yes, okay.

01:43:57.607 --> 01:44:00.402
- Stop!
- Honey, honey. She's gonna... Calm down.

01:44:02.487 --> 01:44:04.489
- Halley?
- Jesus Christ!

01:44:04.573 --> 01:44:07.576
- Sweetie, come on...
- You are... I'm not your sweetie!

01:44:07.659 --> 01:44:09.578
Being very emotional right now.

01:44:11.079 --> 01:44:14.166
You want me to help you
take my child away?

01:44:14.249 --> 01:44:16.877
- I am so sor...
- Are you retarded? You're stupid, right?

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:19.087
- I don't have to go.
- Take a breath. Sweetie.

01:44:19.921 --> 01:44:23.842
You're literally asking me to help you
take away my fucking kid!

01:44:23.925 --> 01:44:25.403
- This is what's best right now.
- Halley, calm down.

01:44:25.427 --> 01:44:27.137
Calm down? Calm down?

01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:30.265
You want me to fuckin' help, right?
You want me to fuckin' help, right?

01:44:30.348 --> 01:44:32.434
- Get the fuck outta my house!
- Hey, calm down.

01:44:32.517 --> 01:44:35.103
Stop! You're such a liar!

01:44:35.687 --> 01:44:37.522
You're such a liar!

01:44:37.731 --> 01:44:39.524
You're a fucking... Don't touch me!

01:44:39.608 --> 01:44:41.168
- Stop.
- She just went to get your mom.

01:44:41.193 --> 01:44:43.653
You have to stop!

01:44:44.404 --> 01:44:45.864
I don't wanna go!

01:44:47.741 --> 01:44:49.201
- Liar!
- Moonee!

01:44:50.619 --> 01:44:52.329
Shut the fuck up! Don't touch...

01:44:54.498 --> 01:44:55.499
Moonee!

01:44:56.792 --> 01:44:59.795
Moonee! Oh, my God. Officer!

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:05.008
...fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!

01:45:05.842 --> 01:45:06.842
Officer!

01:45:08.386 --> 01:45:10.764
- I don't care!
- The child's running!

01:45:15.769 --> 01:45:18.688
No! No. That way. Towards the highway!

01:45:18.772 --> 01:45:21.233
- 81, I got a child running eastbound...
- What's going on?

01:45:21.316 --> 01:45:22.317
I don't know. Just...

01:45:26.530 --> 01:45:29.950
- DCF...
- Jesus Christ.

01:45:31.618 --> 01:45:32.702
I tried to hold her.

01:45:32.786 --> 01:45:34.579
You let her just run away?

01:45:34.663 --> 01:45:37.582
- Halley, will you please just...
- And I'm the one who's unfit?

01:45:39.376 --> 01:45:41.711
Fuck you!

01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:44.380
Jancey!

01:45:52.472 --> 01:45:53.472
Hi, Moonee.

01:45:53.515 --> 01:45:54.933
Here you go, honey.

01:45:55.308 --> 01:45:57.352
Jancey. Come, honey. It's time to eat.

01:45:58.478 --> 01:46:00.647
We're just about to have lunch,
are you hungry?

01:46:00.730 --> 01:46:02.482
Moonee, you want a bowl, honey?

01:46:09.322 --> 01:46:10.365
Moonee, what's wrong?

01:46:11.741 --> 01:46:14.494
Lucy! <i>Por favor</i>, look at this!

01:46:17.706 --> 01:46:18.706
Please!

01:46:20.458 --> 01:46:22.002
You're scaring me, Moonee.

01:46:22.085 --> 01:46:27.132
You're my best friend, and this may be
the only time I'm going to see you again.

01:46:27.215 --> 01:46:28.466
What's going on?

01:46:29.134 --> 01:46:31.261
Just wait right here, okay? Don't move.

01:46:51.281 --> 01:46:53.325
I can't say it.

01:47:00.749 --> 01:47:02.417
Bye!
