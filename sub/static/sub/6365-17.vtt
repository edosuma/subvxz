00:01.568 --> 00:03.268
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
Leith: <i>I don't care</i>

00:03.270 --> 00:04.570
What they say.
I want you.

00:04.572 --> 00:05.637
Bash:
<i>How did you heal</i>

00:05.639 --> 00:06.739
That woman's son?

00:06.741 --> 00:08.140
I laid hands on him.

00:08.142 --> 00:11.643
Mary: <i>I have hired an agent</i>
<i>to gather intelligence for me.</i>

00:11.645 --> 00:13.545
I need to know
which harbors are safe to land

00:13.547 --> 00:15.614
In scotland and which areas
have not been infiltrated

00:15.616 --> 00:17.383
By elizabeth's troops.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.751
I will go to
scotland with you.

00:18.753 --> 00:21.620
You may remain at court
with condÃ© with my protection.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.623
Francis has had a change
of heart. He's not going
to stand in our way.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.226
When this is over, you will be
running for your life.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.661
<i>Be sensible.</i>
<i>Meet with elizabeth's envoy.</i>

00:29.663 --> 00:31.697
<i>Build a future controlled</i>
<i>by you.</i>

00:31.699 --> 00:33.632
Nostradamus:
<i>I saw your son's future.</i>

00:33.634 --> 00:37.703
<i>His union with mary.</i>
<i>She will cost francis his life.</i>

00:39.706 --> 00:42.341
You there.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.410
What's your rush?

00:44.412 --> 00:46.211
Tell me your name.
Collins.

00:46.213 --> 00:50.149
You were cheated back
there at the card table,

00:50.151 --> 00:52.684
But I think you knew that.
I've never had luck
on my side.

00:52.686 --> 00:56.055
You'd think it'd stop me from
betting on cards, but, uh...

00:56.057 --> 00:58.590
What business do you
have in le havre,

00:58.592 --> 01:00.592
Mr. Collins?

01:00.594 --> 01:02.227
A port town of this size,

01:02.229 --> 01:03.629
Surely you see your share
of outsiders.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.631
We do. Most of them

01:05.633 --> 01:08.634
More than happy
to submit to my questions.

01:12.472 --> 01:14.373
(grunting)

01:29.722 --> 01:31.523
(muffled shouting)

01:36.830 --> 01:37.729
(shouting stops)

01:48.141 --> 01:50.776
And what news do you bring us...

01:50.778 --> 01:53.779
From mary, queen of scots?

01:54.814 --> 01:57.282
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

01:59.752 --> 02:02.521
â™ª they all need something

02:02.523 --> 02:07.392
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

02:07.394 --> 02:10.729
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

02:10.731 --> 02:14.733
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

02:14.735 --> 02:18.137
â™ª

02:26.379 --> 02:29.214
Forgive the sins of my body,
o lord,

02:29.216 --> 02:32.885
As they give my heart
the strength it needs to heal.

02:38.925 --> 02:40.626
Conde:
Were you followed?

02:40.628 --> 02:44.163
No. But it's getting harder
to find moments

02:44.165 --> 02:45.664
When no one's watching.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.567
I tried to get away
from the girl who brings

02:48.569 --> 02:50.302
My breakfast by telling her
I had a cold.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.871
Now the kitchen has me
on a steady diet of plain broth

02:52.873 --> 02:54.806
And foul-smelling herbs.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.809
The lies are piling up.
They are.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.745
For me, too.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.580
But you're here now.

03:05.952 --> 03:08.320
Promise me you'll be careful.
Bash: You don't need
to worry about me.

03:08.322 --> 03:11.256
Not anymore.
That's a wife's duty.

03:11.258 --> 03:14.560
I am still your wife.

03:14.562 --> 03:17.763
Perhaps in name only, but I will
always worry for your safety.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.902
That's the last of it.
While I'm gone, I'll have
the rest of my things

03:23.904 --> 03:27.239
Brought to the commander's
quarters in the south keep.
I can set up

03:27.241 --> 03:29.441
Your rooms for you.
Make them nice.

03:30.944 --> 03:34.746
Uh, kenna, I have something that
I wanted to talk to you about.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.349
Promise me...

03:37.351 --> 03:39.785
You will resist the urge
to annul our union.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.621
Why would I?
For another.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.389
Bash,

03:44.391 --> 03:46.425
Apart from you,
I've only been lied to

03:46.427 --> 03:48.627
And betrayed by men.
Who want you.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.262
They always do.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.730
Kings and everyday bastards
alike.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.998
You prefer kings.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Bash.
Eventually a man
will come along

03:55.002 --> 03:57.603
With enough power to
make you feel safe.

03:57.605 --> 04:01.907
But until then, you or any woman
is better off wed.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.942
Allow my name
to protect you.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.278
I will.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.947
â™ª I, I can't find a way
to breathe... â™ª

04:08.949 --> 04:10.816
You are kind.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.318
And strong.
And the only man

04:13.320 --> 04:14.987
Who's ever put my needs
above his own.

04:14.989 --> 04:17.956
And yet we both know

04:17.958 --> 04:19.391
I'm not the man for you.

04:19.393 --> 04:22.828
â™ª my tears all wear me down

04:22.830 --> 04:28.033
â™ª oh, who's gonna save me now?

04:28.035 --> 04:31.003
I can't keep living
like this.

04:31.005 --> 04:32.838
The lies, the hiding.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.874
Facing my husband every day,
knowing his thoughts

04:35.876 --> 04:39.378
Must be consumed by images
of you and I together.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.380
We must leave France
sooner rather than later.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.982
We are leaving.
Your agent ridley and his men

04:43.984 --> 04:45.951
Are set to land in scotland
in one week.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.953
With his help, we'll know
for sure if buckhaven

04:47.955 --> 04:50.722
Is a safe port of entry
under catholic control.
And your men

04:50.724 --> 04:53.025
Are prepared to accompany us?
They wait only

04:53.027 --> 04:54.326
For my word.

04:55.595 --> 04:58.930
â™ª oh, who's gonna save me now?

04:58.932 --> 05:02.834
Promise me that when the day
comes, we'll get on that boat

05:02.836 --> 05:04.970
And you'll leave
all this behind.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.638
Yes.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.907
For my country and for you.

05:08.909 --> 05:12.511
Mary, we're so close.

05:14.580 --> 05:15.881
Good morning.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.449
Catherine, good morning.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.018
Mary?

05:20.020 --> 05:22.688
Oh, you look flushed.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.656
Are you feverish?
I'm sure it will pass.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.957
Thank you for your concern.

05:28.461 --> 05:31.430
Find out

05:31.432 --> 05:34.533
How many times our pious queen
has taken

05:34.535 --> 05:37.035
Her morning prayers in
the chapel this week.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.004
Without arousing suspicion.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.376
Advisor:
<i>Though our forces have had</i>

05:44.378 --> 05:46.878
Great success
in tamping down extremists,

05:46.880 --> 05:48.914
I'm afraid
the few remaining only

05:48.916 --> 05:51.016
Grow more militant.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.119
I would like
to divert more forces

05:54.121 --> 05:56.788
To rouen and la rochelle.

05:56.790 --> 05:57.989
Why?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.725
Rouen is teeming
with protestants,

05:59.727 --> 06:02.027
But their protests
remain largely peaceful.

06:02.029 --> 06:05.364
Uh, the king would prefer
a thorough review of the subject

06:05.366 --> 06:06.665
Before making a decision.

06:09.936 --> 06:11.870
What is it?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.739
A hospitality matter.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.640
The duke and duchess of berry

06:15.642 --> 06:16.708
Have arrived
and with them something

06:16.710 --> 06:18.410
Of a panic among the servants.

06:18.412 --> 06:19.878
You'll excuse me?

06:23.383 --> 06:25.016
(clears throat)
out.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.119
Now.

06:30.656 --> 06:31.990
Why are you so distracted?

06:31.992 --> 06:33.492
This isn't like you.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.826
This needs your attention.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.896
Where is your head?

06:37.898 --> 06:40.132
No one knows or understands
better than me

06:40.134 --> 06:42.100
What went wrong
in your marriage.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.902
And mary has been through

06:43.904 --> 06:46.505
Considerable trauma.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.940
But prince condÃ©
lingers at court

06:48.942 --> 06:50.675
With no pressing reason
to be here.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.078
He is our cousin and negotiates
for his region at court.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.647
He harbors feelings
for your wife.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.083
Your recently separated wife.
Oh, careful, mother.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.119
You need to be careful.
I've been watching mary.

07:01.121 --> 07:04.089
She's visited the chapel four
times in the last five days.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.759
Do you know what would happen
to them if they got caught?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.761
Mary's infidelity
calls into question

07:09.763 --> 07:11.763
Our alliance with scotland,

07:11.765 --> 07:13.999
It weakens you in the eyes
of elizabeth

07:14.001 --> 07:16.001
And your enemies abroad.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.003
There are nobles here

07:18.005 --> 07:20.005
Who would call for her head.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.007
Mary has always been
honest with me.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.775
(laughs)
despite the distance
between us.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.777
She has no interest in condÃ©.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.112
She is loyal.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.181
To me and to France.
(murmurs)

07:29.183 --> 07:30.215
Not another word
of this nonsense.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.751
Not to mary or to anyone.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.753
Certainly that
trauma you refer to

07:34.755 --> 07:37.222
Has earned her respite from
your petty allegations.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.029
Servant:
<i>Some refreshment,</i>

07:44.031 --> 07:45.197
Lord burgess?

07:45.199 --> 07:47.098
As expected, queen elizabeth

07:47.100 --> 07:48.533
Was pleased to learn
of your eagerness

07:48.535 --> 07:49.701
To foster a marriage alliance.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.770
Hmm. Well, eagerness aside,

07:51.772 --> 07:54.072
I am willing to wait patiently
for her decision.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.707
I would never want
the queen of England

07:55.709 --> 07:57.943
To think I'm rushing her.
You're not.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.912
Her majesty wants to
make your acquaintance.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.948
We sail for England in two days.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.884
A trip to England this soon

08:05.886 --> 08:08.487
Is not what I'd expected.
Mm, well,

08:08.489 --> 08:10.188
Elizabeth's advisors
have convinced her

08:10.190 --> 08:11.790
It's in her best interest
to settle on a husband

08:11.792 --> 08:13.058
Without delay.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.626
Now, a young woman ruling

08:14.628 --> 08:15.961
Without a man to
turn to for answers?

08:15.963 --> 08:17.229
To govern her in turn?

08:17.231 --> 08:19.498
It's unnatural
and worrisome

08:19.500 --> 08:21.833
For England's nobles.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.802
Prince condÃ©?

08:23.804 --> 08:25.003
To an objective observer,
it would seem

08:25.005 --> 08:26.137
That you're stalling for time.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.506
Not at all.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.040
But we would need

08:29.042 --> 08:31.109
Time to settle terms.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.644
What lands I'd be gifted,
what...

08:32.646 --> 08:33.678
"terms"?

08:33.680 --> 08:35.113
The terms here are simple.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.116
To be considered as the next
king consort of England,

08:38.118 --> 08:40.218
Queen elizabeth would
like to lay eyes on you.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.154
One's physical attributes

08:43.156 --> 08:44.990
Are of some importance
to her majesty.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.225
Then send her my portrait.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.761
Hmm. You will sail with me

08:49.763 --> 08:51.530
In two days' time...

08:51.532 --> 08:53.598
Or give up

08:53.600 --> 08:56.134
Any hope you have of
becoming king of England.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.674
Prince condÃ©,
what a pleasure.

09:02.676 --> 09:03.808
Won't you join me?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.212
Where on earth have you been?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.947
I had business
in the village.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.315
Ridley, our advance man,
is dead.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.151
He never reached scotland.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.254
I received a coded message from
mcnabb, his second in command.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.257
He found ridley's body
robbed of his possessions,

09:19.259 --> 09:20.859
Including the letters
to the lords

09:20.861 --> 09:22.661
At both potential ports
in scotland.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.262
Louis, those letters

09:24.264 --> 09:25.864
Bore my seal.
They were a calculated risk.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.933
The only way for ridley to prove

09:27.935 --> 09:29.134
The legitimacy of his mission.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.136
I need you
to seek out mcnabb.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.038
Find out what really
happened that night.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.273
He's the only one who might
be able to help us

09:35.275 --> 09:37.809
Find ridley's killer,
and I can't risk him

09:37.811 --> 09:39.244
Being spotted here at court.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.712
If it was a spy for England,

09:40.714 --> 09:41.947
We would sail into a
trap with or without

09:41.949 --> 09:43.014
Ridley's intelligence.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.316
And if it was a spy for France?

09:44.318 --> 09:47.218
If proof of your plan
gets back to francis,

09:47.220 --> 09:49.220
We might both lose our heads,

09:49.222 --> 09:51.890
Whether francis wants it or not.

09:59.165 --> 10:01.166
Claude:
Surprise.

10:01.168 --> 10:04.636
(sighs)

10:04.638 --> 10:05.971
Oh.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.339
It's you.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.975
You were expecting
someone else?

10:09.977 --> 10:12.177
If your mother knew
you were in my bed,

10:12.179 --> 10:14.079
She would not be happy.

10:14.081 --> 10:17.282
A fact of which you, claude...

10:17.284 --> 10:19.284
Are well aware.

10:25.324 --> 10:29.227
Does this technique
typically work for you?

10:29.229 --> 10:31.363
Pursuing a man who has

10:31.365 --> 10:34.265
Already politely declined?

10:34.267 --> 10:36.167
Of course it does.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.202
I tend to get

10:37.204 --> 10:39.371
Whatever it is that I want.

10:39.373 --> 10:40.705
Well...

10:40.707 --> 10:42.207
(gasps)

10:42.209 --> 10:43.308
...Not today.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.846
Greer:
<i>The salt cod</i>

10:47.848 --> 10:49.214
Was a splurge,

10:49.216 --> 10:51.383
But one can only force down
so much guinea pie.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.785
Salt cod,
a splurge?

10:53.787 --> 10:56.221
You used to call it
"peasant food."

10:56.223 --> 10:58.256
That was when I
could only dream

10:58.258 --> 11:00.358
Of walking through the
village with you on my arm.

11:02.228 --> 11:05.096
I am amazed at your
resiliency, greer.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.331
I knew you had
it in you.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.799
I didn't.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.968
Well, I'm glad
you were right.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.169
Ooh! (giggles)

11:11.171 --> 11:13.271
(knock at door)

11:13.273 --> 11:15.173
I'm ever so sorry to interrupt,

11:15.175 --> 11:17.108
But we're dealing
with a bit of an emergency.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.277
I've got a willing bloke
downstairs

11:19.279 --> 11:20.712
And no place to, um...

11:20.714 --> 11:22.847
Ply my trade.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.949
What about your room?
Well, I gave
that to gigi.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.251
She's been at it for hours

11:26.253 --> 11:27.786
With that handsome fellow
in from the coast.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.020
Tell your customer

11:29.022 --> 11:30.355
It'll just be a moment.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.124
Last night,

11:33.126 --> 11:35.126
She wakes us from
a dead sleep

11:35.128 --> 11:36.327
Because she
needs a gown

11:36.329 --> 11:38.329
For a john who has a
penchant for taffeta.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.699
Aren't people so strange
and fascinating?

11:40.701 --> 11:42.400
Maybe at first.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.868
Aren't you getting
tired of this?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.136
This--

11:45.138 --> 11:46.438
Gigi and sharlene,

11:46.440 --> 11:48.339
Salt cod and guinea pie--
is my life now.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.376
I'm saving to rent a townhouse,

11:51.378 --> 11:53.344
But until then...

11:53.346 --> 11:54.846
Well, you knew what
you were getting into

11:54.848 --> 11:56.848
And I won't apologize for it.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.216
Well, what if I could marry you?

11:59.418 --> 12:00.819
Leith, I'm already married.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.120
To a protestant.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.055
Protestants believe in divorce.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.390
Do you really think
it's that easy?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.392
I can't even get a letter
to my husband

12:07.394 --> 12:08.793
While he suffers in prison.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.295
He couldn't agree
if he wanted to.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.463
Well, an
annulment, then.

12:11.465 --> 12:12.931
You could do it
without his agreement.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.432
You were married
in a catholic ceremony,

12:14.434 --> 12:15.967
It-it could
work.
Annulments require

12:15.969 --> 12:17.302
The consent of the vatican--

12:17.304 --> 12:19.237
Money, power...
We have powerful
friends.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.906
No, leith. No.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.742
Please, I beg of you, let it go.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.478
My past life
is in ruins,

12:26.480 --> 12:30.148
And I'm only just now starting
to pick up the pieces.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.417
So much has been taken from me.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.319
Do you know what it feels like

12:34.321 --> 12:36.020
To be reminded of
what I can never have?

12:36.022 --> 12:38.323
(sighs)

12:38.325 --> 12:41.459
You're an honorable,
decent man

12:41.461 --> 12:43.361
Who seeks an honorable,
decent life.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.864
It's why I've always loved you.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.800
But all I can offer you is me.

12:48.802 --> 12:51.102
And you're enough.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.005
I'm sorry.

12:59.211 --> 13:00.879
We never even made it
out of France.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.381
Ridley led us
as far as le havre.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.383
We'd taken rooms
at an inn.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.385
Ridley got in on a game
of three card brag.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.254
In the morning, I found his body

13:09.256 --> 13:11.289
In an alley
outside the tavern.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.391
By then, the letters were gone.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.859
A victim of common thieves?

13:14.861 --> 13:16.528
A card game gone wrong?

13:16.530 --> 13:17.862
Port towns are thick
with dodgy characters.

13:17.864 --> 13:19.264
They're also hubs for espionage.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.933
We did our best
to appear inconspicuous,

13:21.935 --> 13:25.370
But to a trained eye, a royal
operative is easily made.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.405
I think ridley
was killed deliberately.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.074
That there were spies
amongst us that night.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.110
Then I need you to find out
who they answer to:

13:32.112 --> 13:33.878
England, France,
or someone else.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.280
Yes, lord condÃ©.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.415
Francis:
I hear you're leaving us.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.118
What business
do you have in the north?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.586
It's a neglected
part of your realm.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.454
And on the way,
I'm going to check in

13:43.456 --> 13:45.924
On a corrupt deputy
who I've long owed a visit.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.525
I worry that may not be

13:47.527 --> 13:49.294
The only reason for
your sudden departure.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.095
Careful, brother.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.097
Today may not be the day
to embark on a long

13:53.099 --> 13:55.533
And dangerous journey.
And why is that?

13:55.535 --> 13:57.969
Well, if you're looking
for a fight,

13:57.971 --> 13:59.237
You'll surely find one.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.339
Is that what
you're doing?

14:01.341 --> 14:03.608
(sighs)

14:03.610 --> 14:05.443
To lose a wife
is a difficult thing.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.079
As you well know,
from the look of you.

14:08.081 --> 14:11.482
I suppose condÃ©'s relishing
the distance between you

14:11.484 --> 14:13.885
To further his romantic agenda
with mary.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.186
Mary's smarter
than that.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.089
She's given condÃ© a wide berth.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.494
When I return,

14:23.496 --> 14:27.098
See that a drink is waiting
for me, won't you?

14:33.005 --> 14:34.472
Francis:
Did you honestly think that
you could get away with it?

14:34.474 --> 14:35.907
She knows.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.442
My mother knows.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.645
Perhaps I was delusional
for believing that you might

14:40.647 --> 14:43.615
Exercise restraint
or possibly even reconsider

14:43.617 --> 14:45.116
Taking condÃ© into your bed.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.053
Is this happy news?
You look relieved.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.588
Of course not.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.523
I begged you for discretion.
I'm sorry, francis.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.392
And now I am lying for you,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.594
Lying even to
my brother,

14:56.596 --> 14:58.296
Protecting you as
you take comfort

14:58.298 --> 14:59.564
In the arms of another.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.932
This is not
what I wanted.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.301
I only wanted to find...
Happiness.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.535
I know.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.104
Your happiness.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.673
But I don't know how much longer

15:08.675 --> 15:10.208
I can maintain this charade.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.478
I made you
a promise,

15:13.480 --> 15:15.113
And it's one
I won't break.

15:15.115 --> 15:18.616
You are free to be with condÃ©.

15:20.552 --> 15:23.254
But I can't control my mother's
appetite for vengeance.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.658
Conde:
We need to leave for scotland.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.660
Right now. Today.
Mary:
How?

15:28.662 --> 15:31.496
Catherine will have spies
watching my every move.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.231
There's no time to waste.
If francis doesn't

15:33.233 --> 15:34.499
Have your letters, that doesn't
mean he won't, and soon.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.501
We'll be found out,
by him or somebody else.

15:36.503 --> 15:39.037
Louis, don't you see?
I'm scared.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.538
I made a choice,

15:40.540 --> 15:42.640
And I thought I had the strength
to face the risks head-on.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.043
But our plans are crumbling
around us.
So we do nothing?

15:45.045 --> 15:47.645
We wait until what?
Until francis knows?

15:47.647 --> 15:49.547
Until we're discovered
and it's too late

15:49.549 --> 15:50.648
To run for our lives, mary?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.150
Run where?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.085
Ridley's man mcnabb
is certain

15:54.087 --> 15:55.520
That a spy took
my letters.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.722
Francis doesn't have them.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.524
If the spy is english
and not french,

15:59.526 --> 16:01.025
Then elizabeth will be

16:01.027 --> 16:02.593
Bolstering her troops
in scotland.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.529
Without intelligence,

16:04.531 --> 16:06.731
Solid intelligence, we would be
sailing right into an ambush.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.334
It's too late for me,

16:09.336 --> 16:10.969
But your name isn't
on those letters.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.705
If we end our mission now,
I can still save you.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.009
There may still be a way.

16:19.345 --> 16:21.346
I have an english contact,

16:21.348 --> 16:23.314
A high-ranking negotiator.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.582
He serves elizabeth in France

16:24.584 --> 16:27.018
And abroad...
And scotland.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.586
He might have information

16:28.588 --> 16:30.121
About England's
military strategy there.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.456
Who?

16:31.458 --> 16:34.192
His name's lord burgess.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.427
He was sent here to negotiate
a marriage alliance

16:36.429 --> 16:37.695
Between queen elizabeth...

16:39.031 --> 16:40.732
...And me.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.467
You?

16:42.469 --> 16:44.335
I've been taking secret
meetings with him

16:44.337 --> 16:46.404
As recently as this morning.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.642
You... You encouraged
such an alliance?

16:51.644 --> 16:52.643
At first, but not anymore.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.579
"not anymore"?

16:54.581 --> 16:56.647
And when did you have
this change of heart?

16:56.649 --> 16:59.650
When you were professing
your love for me?

16:59.652 --> 17:01.652
When you pledged
to stand by my side?

17:01.654 --> 17:03.021
I'm saying no,
without regard for
elizabeth's retribution,

17:03.023 --> 17:04.589
Because I believe in us.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.724
I trust you.
You're a liar!

17:07.659 --> 17:09.293
I trusted you!
I opened my heart

17:09.295 --> 17:11.095
To a liar!
Mary, please understand...

17:11.097 --> 17:13.097
I do understand, louis.

17:14.099 --> 17:16.467
I understand
that you doubted me.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.603
You doubted that we'd
even get to scotland,

17:18.605 --> 17:20.071
Because you weren't convinced

17:20.073 --> 17:21.305
That I would leave francis
in the end.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.074
When I was prepared

17:23.076 --> 17:24.742
To give you everything.

17:24.744 --> 17:28.146
I will find a way
to see you home.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.715
To prove to you
that I have no doubts

17:30.717 --> 17:32.116
That it's you who I want.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.587
Even if you could...

17:36.589 --> 17:39.791
What makes you think
I'd take you with me?

17:48.467 --> 17:49.767
Deputy:
My region is happy to
welcome the king's deputy,

17:49.769 --> 17:51.502
No matter
the inquiry.

17:51.504 --> 17:52.637
Please, come inside;

17:52.639 --> 17:54.105
You've been
riding for hours.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.339
The journey was long.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.341
But the rumors of a man

17:57.343 --> 17:59.510
Who swore allegiance
to the crown, bending the laws

17:59.512 --> 18:01.446
To line his own pockets,

18:01.448 --> 18:03.481
Made it necessary.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.715
You must be
mistaken.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.818
I've policed this territory
for years

18:06.820 --> 18:08.653
And have heard no complaints.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.421
Perhaps because
you've silenced

18:10.423 --> 18:12.757
The people's voices.
A visitor?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.692
Should I stoke the fire?

18:14.694 --> 18:16.327
Back inside
with you. Now.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.528
Take your hands off her.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.664
Who left those marks
on your face?

18:19.666 --> 18:20.798
Her face is
my business.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.433
And she earns every
mark she gets.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.835
(woman gasps, deputy grunts)

18:23.837 --> 18:27.205
Take this and go
to the castle.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.440
Use my name. They'll give
you shelter and a job.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.542
Oh, thank you, but...
Go inside and
gather your things.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.844
I'll make sure
someone rides with you.

18:33.679 --> 18:35.680
They are born as women

18:35.682 --> 18:36.881
Into a world that
casts them aside.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.416
And then men like you,

18:38.418 --> 18:41.686
Bullies, liars,
think you own them.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.421
Their king and master.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.823
These women, who trusted you
enough to care for you,

18:45.825 --> 18:48.226
To marry you,
become your playthings.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.760
Your punching bag.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.896
You are no king.

18:54.733 --> 18:57.768
Don't even think
of going after her.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.771
You are hereby
stripped of your title

19:00.773 --> 19:02.807
By order of the king of France.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.313
Lola:
You've been out here for hours.

19:09.315 --> 19:12.750
The cold air
does me good.

19:15.187 --> 19:17.288
Mary, you know
you can tell me anything.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.860
Lola, I feel so trapped here.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.495
So alone.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.564
You and francis, I...

19:26.566 --> 19:27.798
I know how painful

19:27.800 --> 19:29.867
Your estrangement must feel.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.802
But you have to know that,

19:31.804 --> 19:33.204
No matter your choices,

19:33.206 --> 19:34.672
You still have
a husband who would do

19:34.674 --> 19:36.941
Anything to make you happy.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.744
He told you.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.779
About louis.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.182
You know about our affair.
Francis trusted me

19:44.184 --> 19:46.651
Because he knows
I will support you, always.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.952
Do you?

19:47.954 --> 19:49.587
Oh...

19:49.589 --> 19:51.889
If condÃ© is the man
who can free you

19:51.891 --> 19:53.891
From the pain
I have watched you suffer,

19:53.893 --> 19:56.327
Then yes.
Be with him.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.563
Who am I to judge?

19:58.565 --> 20:00.798
Louis and I are done.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.734
He betrayed me.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.237
He's been secretly entertaining

20:06.239 --> 20:08.973
A marriage proposal from
queen elizabeth for weeks.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.209
From elizabeth?

20:11.211 --> 20:13.911
I was set to sail home.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.981
To reclaim my throne
with louis at my side.

20:20.452 --> 20:22.253
The risk you two are taking...

20:22.255 --> 20:24.989
CondÃ©, to defy
elizabeth...

20:26.925 --> 20:29.227
You do realize that,
if he turns her down...

20:29.229 --> 20:31.929
He said he was going to.
...It will provoke her.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.465
He'll become an enemy
of the queen of England,

20:34.467 --> 20:35.933
And I'm sorry,

20:35.935 --> 20:37.368
But for what future?

20:37.370 --> 20:40.538
You're a married queen.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.473
Can you blame him
for his doubts?

20:43.976 --> 20:45.643
Are you still going to scotland?

20:45.645 --> 20:49.280
Our plans have suffered
a terrible setback.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.016
There's no hope now
of making the journey safely,

20:52.018 --> 20:55.286
And... Lola, I'm afraid.

20:58.857 --> 21:00.858
When I came to
this country,

21:00.860 --> 21:05.529
I left my family
behind, my life.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.531
I was terrified.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.534
And I was just your lady,
with little responsibility

21:10.536 --> 21:12.536
Other than standing
at my friend's side.

21:12.538 --> 21:16.540
But you, you
were fearless.

21:16.542 --> 21:19.877
Standing up to the rulers
of France again and again

21:19.879 --> 21:21.879
With a fire that
I'd never seen.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.315
Fighting for
us, for aid,

21:24.317 --> 21:27.818
For troops,
for scotland.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.021
Mary, you have been
waiting for so long

21:30.023 --> 21:31.956
For the day when you
can take your throne.

21:31.958 --> 21:35.960
It may not be my throne
by the time I get there.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.763
And that girl

21:38.765 --> 21:41.666
Who knew no fear,

21:41.668 --> 21:43.668
I am not her anymore.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.869
No.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.871
You are wiser

21:46.873 --> 21:49.874
And stronger.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.876
Remember that strength

21:51.878 --> 21:54.078
That so many have
tried to take from you.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.915
It is in you
still, my friend,

21:57.917 --> 22:00.751
My queen.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.653
Go.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.655
And if condÃ© can aid
you on your journey,

22:04.657 --> 22:08.759
Forgive him, keep
him at your side.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.639
I had a visitor to my
chambers this morning.

22:21.641 --> 22:22.940
Your daughter.

22:24.443 --> 22:26.043
It was unannounced

22:26.045 --> 22:28.879
And not the first of its kind.

22:28.881 --> 22:29.980
Mm.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.982
She comes to me
to annoy you.

22:31.984 --> 22:35.519
Because she sees that
we've grown closer.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.054
Admit it.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.090
You enjoy my company.

22:39.092 --> 22:41.392
You are a necessary evil

22:41.394 --> 22:43.127
Whose orbit I can't
seem to escape.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.929
Who stands by you

22:44.931 --> 22:47.965
And protects your family's
interests at every turn.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.701
Well, we share
a mutually beneficial

22:50.703 --> 22:51.936
Political
relationship.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.972
To read more into it
would be a foolish mistake.

22:54.974 --> 22:57.575
Your bedroom
activities

22:57.577 --> 23:00.044
And who you engage in them with
are of no concern.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.546
Don't announce them to me.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.048
All right then.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.450
I won't.

23:06.452 --> 23:09.954
I shall do as I please
as silently and respectfully

23:09.956 --> 23:12.857
As any political
associate of yours would.

23:14.793 --> 23:16.093
As any colleague

23:16.095 --> 23:19.096
With a penchant

23:19.098 --> 23:21.098
For beautiful women,

23:21.100 --> 23:25.102
Or as any man who bears
his inexplicable appeal

23:25.104 --> 23:28.139
To young
lusty royals.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.578
(door opens)

23:39.418 --> 23:41.419
This is not
a reconciliation, louis.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.587
I realized
you were right.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.589
The only way to escape
the repercussions

23:45.591 --> 23:48.959
Of the discovery of my letters
is to leave for scotland.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.595
Unannounced and as swiftly
as possible.

23:51.597 --> 23:54.432
I will use elizabeth's
envoy, lord burgess,

23:54.434 --> 23:56.834
To get the information I need
to sail home safely.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.537
But I will need your help
getting it from him.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.506
Helping you means betraying
the queen of England.

24:02.508 --> 24:05.509
All for a woman who doesn't know
if she wants to be with me,

24:05.511 --> 24:07.511
Who may not even
take me with her.

24:09.014 --> 24:11.182
I love you, mary.

24:11.184 --> 24:15.019
I'll do anything to
prove my loyalty,

24:15.021 --> 24:17.221
But I need you
to be very clear

24:17.223 --> 24:19.990
About what it is
you're asking of me.

24:21.026 --> 24:24.094
Where can I find
the envoy?

24:27.199 --> 24:30.000
(rustling)

24:32.070 --> 24:33.103
(rustling)

24:33.105 --> 24:35.105
Who's there?

24:36.475 --> 24:37.608
Deputy:
A friend.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.677
(gasping)

24:46.117 --> 24:48.819
Your brother, the king,
can't protect you now.

24:58.797 --> 25:00.898
You called for me,
your majesty.
Leith bayard.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.134
(chuckles) I need someone
for a special position.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.670
Someone trustworthy, discreet.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.573
You can view it
as a promotion.

25:09.575 --> 25:12.776
It's the post of personal
bodyguard to princess claude.

25:14.212 --> 25:15.212
The princess...

25:15.214 --> 25:17.047
Mm-hmm.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.283
...Is such a refined
and-and worldly young lady,

25:19.285 --> 25:22.253
I-I fear she would find
my company boorish.

25:22.255 --> 25:24.255
You need to be at her side
at all times.

25:24.257 --> 25:26.223
And find a way
to keep her occupied.

25:26.225 --> 25:29.126
You want me to take her on walks

25:29.128 --> 25:30.928
Or horseback riding?

25:30.930 --> 25:32.596
Claude isn't
very sporty.

25:32.598 --> 25:36.600
(chuckles) she's very
spirited, passionate,

25:36.602 --> 25:39.236
And, uh, it'll be
your responsibility

25:39.238 --> 25:42.239
To see that she has a safe
receptacle for all that...

25:42.241 --> 25:43.908
Energy.

25:43.910 --> 25:47.211
Make sure she doesn't end up
in the bed of some nobleman

25:47.213 --> 25:48.746
Or a stable boy.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.548
Or your own.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.249
I need someone
comely enough

25:52.251 --> 25:54.251
To keep the
princess' attention

25:54.253 --> 25:56.253
And smart enough
to know his place.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.055
Do we understand each other?

25:58.057 --> 26:00.624
Uh, you don't want a guard,
you want...

26:00.626 --> 26:02.192
A babysitter?!
I've just been informed

26:02.194 --> 26:04.261
I'm no longer allowed
outside the castle,

26:04.263 --> 26:05.930
Or anywhere really,
without a personal guard.

26:06.932 --> 26:08.933
By order of the queen mother.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.936
When will you stop trying
to control me?

26:11.938 --> 26:14.038
When you stop behaving like
you need to be controlled.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.306
It's not going
to work.

26:15.308 --> 26:16.941
I don't care what ogre
you've entrusted

26:16.943 --> 26:18.676
This ridiculous job to...

26:20.145 --> 26:22.846
Oh, hello.

26:22.848 --> 26:25.249
I'll leave you two
to get acquainted.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.851
Uh...

26:27.853 --> 26:29.286
So...

26:29.288 --> 26:32.356
You're my new keeper.

26:37.295 --> 26:39.597
(groans)

26:41.232 --> 26:44.268
(screams)

26:53.044 --> 26:55.179
An annulment
for greer?

26:55.181 --> 26:56.380
I want to marry her.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.215
I'm hopeful it will
bring her a better life.

26:58.217 --> 27:01.018
Since her dismissal from court,
she's fallen hard.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.654
And I'm not without
compassion for her.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.656
But her husband did fund
an attack on this castle,

27:05.658 --> 27:07.257
However honorable
his intentions.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.659
She is labeled
as treasonous.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.094
It's not a label
I gave her,

27:10.096 --> 27:11.729
But it is one that
she is stuck with.

27:11.731 --> 27:12.730
She made mistakes,

27:12.732 --> 27:14.264
But she has paid
for them.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.300
You are choosing a hard road
by standing at her side.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.302
Protect yourself
and your future.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.638
Your own status is on
the rise; reach for more.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.773
But I love her.

27:22.775 --> 27:26.210
Your majesty, I love her.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.811
Greer's husband is imprisoned.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.647
She'll likely never
see him again.

27:29.649 --> 27:32.249
We could have a family,
legitimate children.

27:32.251 --> 27:35.019
That is the future
I seek.

27:36.988 --> 27:39.990
As a king, I often want to
solve the world's problems.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.959
And I would certainly
love to solve yours.

27:41.961 --> 27:45.763
But obtaining annulment
is no easy task,

27:45.765 --> 27:48.666
Even when a king
does the asking.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.668
Every favor from the
vatican comes with a price,

27:50.670 --> 27:54.104
And god only knows what
they would want for this.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.939
Leith, my friend.

27:56.941 --> 27:58.442
Let her go.

28:02.380 --> 28:03.747
It's a nippy one.

28:03.749 --> 28:06.016
You want to warm yourself
on my dumplings?

28:06.018 --> 28:09.420
The vulgar blooms
of France cannot compare

28:09.422 --> 28:11.689
To the subtle grace
of an english rose.

28:14.092 --> 28:17.094
Still, it would be a shame
to leave France

28:17.096 --> 28:19.196
Without sampling
its goods.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.199
Guard:
Stay where you are, sir.

28:23.935 --> 28:25.302
What is the meaning of this?

28:25.304 --> 28:26.437
You are arrested
by order

28:26.439 --> 28:28.105
Of her majesty, queen mary.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.343
Mary: <i>I know you are</i>
<i>in France at the behest</i>

28:33.345 --> 28:34.945
Of your queen,
elizabeth.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.081
I am in France of my own accord.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.882
Did you not think
I would find it suspicious?

28:38.884 --> 28:41.318
A high-ranking diplomat avoiding

28:41.320 --> 28:43.821
An appearance at my court
during his visit?

28:43.823 --> 28:45.823
What is this little
english vole doing,

28:45.825 --> 28:48.992
Scurrying about in secret
in my country?

28:48.994 --> 28:50.360
I'm hardly here in secret,
your majesty.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.462
I've rented rooms in town.

28:51.464 --> 28:53.464
Where my guards have
witnessed you

28:53.466 --> 28:56.166
Breaking bread with known
protestant sympathizers.

28:56.168 --> 28:57.167
What?

28:57.169 --> 28:59.169
Including
victor caron.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.404
Your majesty, no.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.005
No, none of this is true.

29:02.007 --> 29:03.407
I assure you,
I have never met...

29:03.409 --> 29:05.409
Do not presume to think
that you can lie

29:05.411 --> 29:08.979
To the queen of France and
scotland without consequences.

29:08.981 --> 29:11.982
As a feared and militant
protestant revolutionary,

29:11.984 --> 29:14.051
Victor caron is under
surveillance at all times.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.053
And your meeting with him
can only mean

29:16.055 --> 29:17.521
That elizabeth has sent you...

29:17.523 --> 29:19.056
No.

29:19.058 --> 29:20.491
...To fund and organize
a religious revolt

29:20.493 --> 29:22.760
Against the french crown.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.194
Hear me now.

29:24.196 --> 29:27.831
I will respond to any threat
to my sovereignty

29:27.833 --> 29:30.033
With swift
and brutal measures.

29:30.035 --> 29:33.403
If you do not confess
by tomorrow morning,

29:33.405 --> 29:37.441
I will send elizabeth
that basket

29:37.443 --> 29:39.243
With your head in it.

29:42.914 --> 29:45.349
We need burgess to believe
his life is truly in danger

29:45.351 --> 29:46.784
For this to work.

29:46.786 --> 29:47.785
Do you think
he bought it?

29:47.787 --> 29:49.186
I know he did.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.522
I wasn't just
play-acting, louis.

29:51.524 --> 29:54.124
I will spill blood to
defend what's mine.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.260
In that regard, I
meant every word.

30:02.367 --> 30:04.368
Water. Please, some water.

30:04.370 --> 30:05.569
Shut your mouth.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.571
You'll be dead soon enough.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.306
(muffled screaming)

30:15.146 --> 30:17.147
No, no, please!

30:17.149 --> 30:19.149
No, no.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.918
Shh!

30:20.920 --> 30:21.985
We have to move.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.954
Now.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.522
Come. Come.

30:27.125 --> 30:28.559
Burgess:
Where are we going?

30:28.561 --> 30:30.294
This passage leads
outside the castle.

30:30.296 --> 30:32.129
I'm a negotiator sent to
foster a marriage alliance.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.497
Now queen mary suspects
me of conspiring

30:33.499 --> 30:34.565
With protestant
militants?

30:34.567 --> 30:35.966
Doesn't matter--
you're safe now.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.569
When the guards
find me missing,

30:38.571 --> 30:40.571
They'll search every ship
bound for England.

30:40.573 --> 30:43.173
That's why you're not going
to England, not directly.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.842
I secured you passage
on a ship sailing

30:44.844 --> 30:46.310
To the port of buckhaven
in scotland.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.178
From there you can make
your own way home on land.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.547
Thank you.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.549
Your queen would
have had my head.

30:52.551 --> 30:55.552
England and I owe
you a great debt.

30:55.554 --> 30:59.523
But can you order your ship's
captain to-to dock at aberdeen,

30:59.525 --> 31:00.858
A port to the
north, instead?

31:00.860 --> 31:02.593
That's
a longer route.

31:02.595 --> 31:05.362
But buckhaven is a catholic
stronghold, loyal to mary.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.998
I thought scotland was nearly
under elizabeth's control.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.399
With queen mary
safe in France,

31:09.401 --> 31:11.268
There's no need to
rush a takeover.

31:11.270 --> 31:14.271
Scotland's infighting may soon
solve that problem for us.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.273
Until then, port
aberdeen is controlled

31:16.275 --> 31:19.877
By compatriots who, like
you, are loyal to England.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.144
Consider it done.

31:26.551 --> 31:31.255
It is a tragedy that your son
died without last rites.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.090
But if you want
his soul to enter

31:33.092 --> 31:36.093
Into the kingdom of heaven
unencumbered by sin,

31:36.095 --> 31:39.529
The cost of that indulgence
is eight livres,

31:39.531 --> 31:41.298
Not two.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.399
Please, your eminence!

31:42.401 --> 31:44.601
Please!

31:44.603 --> 31:47.471
My servant says you have
a message from court.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.106
What is it?

31:49.108 --> 31:50.607
There is no message.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.476
I lied so I could gain

31:52.478 --> 31:53.911
An audience with you.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.545
Cardinal desjardin,
I've come to ask

31:55.547 --> 31:58.048
For an annulment
for a friend.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.583
(laughs)

31:59.585 --> 32:02.586
The dissolution
of a marriage,

32:02.588 --> 32:04.955
Like lying to an officer
of the church,

32:04.957 --> 32:07.057
Is an affront to god.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.525
I am told that
the vatican

32:08.527 --> 32:11.595
Does grant annulments to
those who are deserving.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.697
Or who can prove
their loyalty.

32:13.699 --> 32:16.633
Please, what can I
do to prove mine?

32:16.635 --> 32:19.303
I am a reverent man,
and I will pay any tithe.

32:19.305 --> 32:20.604
You will pay tithes?

32:20.606 --> 32:23.974
I'm sorry, my son,
but with what coin?

32:23.976 --> 32:25.642
I am a captain in
the palace guard

32:25.644 --> 32:27.077
And a man on the rise.

32:27.079 --> 32:29.012
Well, I-I am a
friend to the king!

32:29.014 --> 32:30.681
I saved his life!
Please, your eminence!

32:30.683 --> 32:32.716
This girl, I love her!
Tell me more

32:32.718 --> 32:36.687
About your time spent
in the service of the king.

32:41.392 --> 32:43.393
I got your message, renaude.

32:43.395 --> 32:46.630
Lord narcisse.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.332
You've kept me waiting.

32:48.334 --> 32:49.633
Well, we could have
done this at court

32:49.635 --> 32:51.668
Over dinner and fine wine.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.670
What I have to say is
for your ears only.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.339
You've always been cautious.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.174
Even when you were
commanding my army.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.276
When I had an army.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.411
I came across a
scotsman in le havre.

33:01.413 --> 33:04.014
This man, collins, he
entered into a card game

33:04.016 --> 33:06.616
With a group of locals,
and was clearly cheated.

33:06.618 --> 33:09.453
I have no use for information
about a petty swindler.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.355
Collins just let it happen.

33:11.357 --> 33:12.589
No confrontation.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.291
Gave up his coin and left.

33:14.293 --> 33:15.625
Eager to avoid attention.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.594
Exactly.

33:17.596 --> 33:20.163
When I tried to ask him
a few simple questions,

33:20.165 --> 33:21.999
He pulled a knife.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.500
His mistake.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.136
When I went through
his things, I found out

33:26.138 --> 33:27.537
His real name was ridley.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.439
And that he is someone
of great import

33:29.441 --> 33:31.141
To the queen.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.110
Queen mary?

33:33.112 --> 33:35.178
What makes you say that?

33:43.321 --> 33:44.688
My god.

33:44.690 --> 33:48.458
Is this the queen
of scots' seal?

33:52.630 --> 33:55.198
A secret campaign
to retake scotland?

33:55.200 --> 33:56.633
Mm.

33:56.635 --> 33:57.801
Mary was leaving France?

33:57.803 --> 34:00.670
Leaving my son?

34:00.672 --> 34:01.671
A brazen move.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.373
No doubt encouraged by that

34:03.375 --> 34:06.376
Bourbon usurper at her side.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.612
I thought she was unfaithful.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.747
I had no idea the depth
of her betrayal.

34:10.749 --> 34:13.550
I've already arranged
for mary's letters

34:13.552 --> 34:15.719
To be returned to them,
seals intact.

34:15.721 --> 34:19.556
Mary and condÃ© will
believe all is well,

34:19.558 --> 34:21.625
And their false sense of
security will give them

34:21.627 --> 34:24.094
Just enough rope
to hang themselves.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.129
No, that's the last thing
that I want.

34:26.131 --> 34:29.099
The enmity between you and mary

34:29.101 --> 34:30.667
Since she returned to
court is known to all.

34:30.669 --> 34:32.636
Mary is not
the same foolish girl

34:32.638 --> 34:33.770
Who was forced
into our care.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.572
And I have come
to care for her.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.708
She has faced many trials here
at court as queen.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.777
She's grown.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.313
She's stronger.
Braver... Clearly.

34:43.315 --> 34:46.650
Sometimes bravery leads
to foolish choices.

34:46.652 --> 34:49.186
And this is one
from which there

34:49.188 --> 34:50.287
Is no turning back.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.655
I have no desire to destroy

34:51.657 --> 34:53.590
Mary or her reputation.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.326
We have to stop her.

34:56.328 --> 34:59.196
Francis must stop her.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.698
(gasping)

35:06.704 --> 35:08.338
Don't move.

35:08.340 --> 35:11.575
You'll lose more blood.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.410
Sister delphine.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.178
Where are we?

35:15.180 --> 35:17.747
You're not...
Wearing your habit.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.382
I'm not really a nun.

35:19.384 --> 35:22.219
I laid hands on you.

35:22.221 --> 35:23.720
Death is coming.

35:23.722 --> 35:26.423
Aah! God.

35:26.425 --> 35:29.226
Help me. The pain.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.694
You know there could be a price.

35:30.696 --> 35:33.730
The blind boy
in the village.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.799
(yelling)

35:37.401 --> 35:38.702
Save me!

35:38.704 --> 35:41.304
I want to live.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.772
That's what they all choose.

35:42.774 --> 35:46.610
Every time.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.282
(rapid gasping)

35:52.284 --> 35:54.451
(screaming)

36:03.528 --> 36:05.529
How did you find the letters?
I've been in contact

36:05.531 --> 36:07.864
With the deputy in le havre,
where ridley was killed.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.467
He and his men captured
and killed a common highwayman

36:10.469 --> 36:12.669
Who had been robbing people
passing through town.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.804
You think this highwayman
killed ridley?

36:14.806 --> 36:17.474
Ridley's effects were found
among his possessions.

36:17.476 --> 36:21.611
Everything was there,
the letters unopened.

36:21.613 --> 36:24.247
Then the secret
of our mission is safe.

36:24.249 --> 36:27.317
Your loyalty will
not go unrewarded.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.556
Everything is in place.

36:32.558 --> 36:33.924
Your trade delegation

36:33.926 --> 36:35.458
Can be quickly assembled.

36:35.460 --> 36:36.860
And thanks to lord burgess,

36:36.862 --> 36:38.428
We know that buckhaven is
a safe port of entry.

36:38.430 --> 36:39.596
Yes.

36:39.598 --> 36:40.964
There is only one
outstanding matter

36:40.966 --> 36:43.934
Before you retake scotland.

36:43.936 --> 36:45.769
Whether you still
want me to come.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.811
There's something you
must know about mary.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.546
And condÃ©.

36:58.583 --> 37:01.585
Lord burgess is safely
headed back to England.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.687
He and queen elizabeth
will remain unaware

37:03.689 --> 37:05.488
That you helped me.

37:05.490 --> 37:08.558
That his arrest and his
rescue was all for me.

37:10.561 --> 37:13.496
You've been playing both sides
for some time now, louis.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.398
It can't go on like this,
not anymore.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.567
You can trust me.
Not until you

37:17.569 --> 37:18.802
Make a choice.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.870
Right now.

37:20.872 --> 37:22.606
Elizabeth or me.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.007
Catherine:
<i>If mary leaves with condÃ©,</i>

37:24.009 --> 37:25.809
France loses not
just a queen,

37:25.811 --> 37:27.344
But scotland, any
claim to England.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.446
You will be left playing
a weak cuckold!

37:29.448 --> 37:32.582
I suspected mary of infidelity.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.284
But this is treason.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.619
Mary:
Consider your choice carefully.

37:35.621 --> 37:39.289
Elizabeth can offer
you marriage,

37:39.291 --> 37:42.692
England, power,
a life of security.

37:42.694 --> 37:45.595
I know that together

37:45.597 --> 37:47.530
We face an uncertain future.

37:47.532 --> 37:50.934
But I still see it...
In scotland,

37:50.936 --> 37:52.602
I still see it.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.671
There's always a choice,
and sometimes that choice

37:54.673 --> 37:56.606
Is so difficult
that it's a leap...

37:56.608 --> 37:59.609
A leap of a fool's faith.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.945
But my heart tells me
that this is it.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.847
This is the moment.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.682
You are my choice.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.651
If you'll still have me.

38:07.653 --> 38:08.918
Catherine:
<i>She won't listen to reason.</i>

38:08.920 --> 38:10.654
She will listen to you.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.489
Francis?

38:12.491 --> 38:13.857
Francis! Francis, you-you...

38:13.859 --> 38:15.358
You must stop her!

38:15.360 --> 38:17.594
For both of your sakes!

38:17.596 --> 38:19.629
Francis?

38:19.631 --> 38:20.797
Francis.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.699
No.

38:22.701 --> 38:23.867
Help... Help! Help!

38:23.869 --> 38:25.335
The king!

38:25.337 --> 38:28.038
My son... My son...

38:28.040 --> 38:29.939
Mary:
<i>I thought I needed you.</i>

38:29.941 --> 38:32.509
Needed us, together in scotland.

38:32.511 --> 38:35.712
To find the person I was.

38:35.714 --> 38:39.616
I convinced myself that in order
to heal I needed you by my side.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.385
But now I know.

38:42.387 --> 38:44.587
Before you dare

38:44.589 --> 38:46.656
To trust anyone else,

38:46.658 --> 38:48.758
You must first trust yourself.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.360
Your own power.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.362
That strength
I'd thought I'd lost,

38:52.364 --> 38:54.364
I haven't.

38:54.366 --> 38:55.765
It's in me still.

38:58.402 --> 39:00.704
Elizabeth may be
the wiser choice.

39:00.706 --> 39:04.507
But I can give you my heart.

39:04.509 --> 39:07.811
My full, strong heart.

39:07.813 --> 39:09.779
(short laugh)

39:13.751 --> 39:16.052
Narcisse:
What is it?

39:16.054 --> 39:18.755
Francis. He's dying.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.757
He's leaving me.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.092
The physicians said
he merely fainted.

39:22.094 --> 39:23.827
He may have an
ear infection,

39:23.829 --> 39:25.995
You have nothing
to worry about.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.063
The vision!

39:27.065 --> 39:28.765
Nostradamus' vision.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.834
He saw how francis died.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.969
He foresaw it--
francis' death.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.537
It's all coming true!

39:34.539 --> 39:36.005
What exactly
did he see?

39:36.007 --> 39:37.674
I can't lose him.

39:37.676 --> 39:39.676
I can't.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.678
I'll be alone!

39:41.680 --> 39:44.647
Charles, henry,
they're too young to rule.

39:44.649 --> 39:47.751
I'll be regent.
I-I... I'm not ready!

39:47.753 --> 39:49.719
The country,
it's too weak.

39:49.721 --> 39:50.854
The pieces are not in place.

39:50.856 --> 39:52.722
I'm hated by everyone.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.457
They want me gone.

39:54.459 --> 39:55.759
They'll do everything
in their power

39:55.761 --> 39:58.128
To make that happen!
Stop it!

39:58.130 --> 40:00.797
This is not like you.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.532
You're worrying about nothing.

40:02.534 --> 40:04.467
You have no idea what
it's like to be a woman.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.636
To be a mother having
to face this world alone.

40:06.638 --> 40:07.837
If you believe anything,

40:07.839 --> 40:09.873
Believe this.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.942
You are not alone.

40:36.734 --> 40:40.003
We should stop now.

40:40.005 --> 40:42.739
I don't want to stop.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.908
I will wait for you.

40:44.910 --> 40:47.210
As long as it takes
until you're ready.

40:47.212 --> 40:50.747
I am ready.

40:50.749 --> 40:53.049
To take back my life.

40:53.051 --> 40:56.586
The courage to give
myself to someone else.

40:56.588 --> 40:57.720
To you.

40:57.722 --> 41:00.623
It's as you said.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.559
You are my choice.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.627
And this is our moment.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.996
Now, louis.
