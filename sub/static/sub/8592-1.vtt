WEBVTT

00:43.400 --> 00:45.607
I have a nice load of ladies
for you this morning.

00:45.680 --> 00:49.048
Them city dick turd packing hookey
motherfuckers have drafted...

00:49.120 --> 00:52.681
my main man away.
They'll send you off to kill Chinks.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.481
Who's gonna take care of
the vineyards for me on the street?

00:55.560 --> 00:57.483
Look son, I don't care
what you mother says.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.406
You're doing the right thing by joining up
now. Get the service out of the way.

01:01.480 --> 01:06.805
You're fighting a real war over there,
boy. It's not like your make up stories.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.489
You're always bragging about
how you ran off and joined up.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.085
It's good enough for you.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.450
- Vinnie...
- Come on, Jill.

01:14.520 --> 01:16.602
Vinnie, I've got work to do.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.566
You've got work to do?
What am I, going to a picnic?

01:19.840 --> 01:21.330
Hey, where you going?

01:22.280 --> 01:25.409
Excuse me, Inspector. You think
J. Edgar Hoover would fire you?

01:25.520 --> 01:27.090
Well, the cuffs have got to stay on.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.927
Bets, about last night, I...

01:31.760 --> 01:34.081
Well, I just...
I want you to know...

01:34.160 --> 01:36.481
Don't worry, Billy.
I wanted to.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.769
It'll make me feel closer
while you're away.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.602
Well, take care of your ass, nigger.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.646
Take care.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.963
You take care of yourself, you hear.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.163
You relax, just relax.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.489
I'll get out of this.
I'll kiss the sergeant or something.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.609
Hey, peace, man.
Make love, not war, man.

01:59.080 --> 02:03.005
August 27, 1967.
We took the oath this morning.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.769
Tyrone Washington, Chicago, Illinois.

02:08.840 --> 02:12.162
Billy Ray Pike, Galveston, Texas.

02:13.480 --> 02:16.484
Me, Alvin Foster, Emporia, Kansas.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.770
Vinnie Fazio, Brooklyn, New York.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.926
Dave Bisbee, Seattle, Washington.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.124
And a bunch of other guys
from all over the country.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.690
I decided to keep a journal...

02:29.760 --> 02:32.730
and write about our experiences
in the Marine Corps.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.121
Maybe I can get it
published some day.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.925
That is if anybody even wants
to read about what happens...

02:38.000 --> 02:41.721
to a bunch of guys
they're gonna send to Vietnam.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.851
- Hey, look at them guys march.
- What?

02:45.680 --> 02:47.682
Hey, you think we're gonna get
machine guns?

02:47.760 --> 02:51.606
I don't know. What do I look like,
an information booth over here?

02:51.680 --> 02:53.444
- Just guys are marching.
- Hey, my name's Alvin.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.761
Hey, Alvin, I'm Vinnie.
Vinnie Fazio.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.330
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to know you.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.765
- Hey?
- What?

02:59.120 --> 03:01.600
- You ever shot a machine gun?
- Have I ever shot a machine gun?

03:01.680 --> 03:02.886
- Yeah.
- I'm from Brooklyn.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.440
- We play ball on the streets, you know.
- You play baseball?

03:05.520 --> 03:06.169
Yeah.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.208
All right, you people, listen up.

03:11.280 --> 03:15.922
You are now at the US Marine Corps
recruit depot San Diego, California.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.521
When you left home, you were under
your mother's care, you are now...

03:18.600 --> 03:21.922
under mine. From now on, you will not
eat, sleep, blow your nose...

03:22.000 --> 03:24.810
or scratch your ass
until someone tells you to do so.

03:24.880 --> 03:28.123
I am going to give you approximately
30 seconds to fall out of this bus...

03:28.200 --> 03:31.921
and god help the last man off because
you better give your soul to god...

03:32.000 --> 03:34.810
because your ass is mine.
Do you understand?

03:34.880 --> 03:37.167
- Yes!
- I can't hear you.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.207
Yes!

03:38.320 --> 03:41.085
Are you a bunch of old ladies?
I still can't hear you.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.288
- Yes, sir!
- Move!

03:43.920 --> 03:45.445
Move. Get out. Get out.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.761
You get out of the bus right now.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.004
God dammit!

04:01.320 --> 04:05.166
What the fuck has the goddamn
recruiters given me now?

04:06.160 --> 04:07.730
Holy shit!

04:07.800 --> 04:11.088
I've never seen a bunch fucking
walking garbage heap in my life.

04:12.160 --> 04:16.051
You look like a bunch of sorry
son of a bitches if I ever saw them!

04:17.200 --> 04:20.204
Mister, you got something
tickling up your ass?

04:20.320 --> 04:22.766
What the fuck are you
bouncing up and down at rest for?

04:22.840 --> 04:26.287
What are you looking at, Hollywood?
Straight eyes.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.769
I don't owe you no money.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.247
Man, we got
Jesus Christ with us today.

04:33.320 --> 04:36.085
What are you looking at? You
should be looking at your father...

04:36.160 --> 04:38.322
God, not me.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.882
Do you find something funny?
Get on fucking knees...

04:41.960 --> 04:43.928
and you be his disciple.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.011
You freaking...
You find again something funny, huh?

04:47.560 --> 04:48.891
Listen, man...

04:49.120 --> 04:51.088
- Listen, man?
- I don't want any hassles.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.844
I mean, I like you. I like you.

04:52.920 --> 04:56.049
I ain't gonna give you no hassle,
I like you too.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.327
- Okay.
- Maybe you love me?

04:58.440 --> 05:01.011
- Yeah, I love you. I love everybody.
- Very good.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.289
I love you, too.
Maybe one day we'll get married.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.404
If you don't get your shit together,
you ain't even have to worry...

05:07.480 --> 05:09.369
about getting engaged!

05:10.320 --> 05:11.924
Okay?
What?!

05:12.040 --> 05:14.884
- All right, sir!
- Thank you very much!

05:18.240 --> 05:20.083
You find something funny?

05:20.160 --> 05:22.447
- Did you eat shit this morning?
- No, sir.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.490
Then why the fucking shit eating grin?
What do you mean?

05:25.560 --> 05:28.609
Don't even start to explain yourself.
You're a bad fucking excuse.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.969
Get up on your goddamn feet,
you shit head!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.365
Come on, snap to!

05:34.600 --> 05:36.364
Hollywood, what are you looking at?

05:36.480 --> 05:39.723
Take off those goddamn glasses
before I yank them off you.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.561
Hey, god dammit.
You, with the fucking pretty face.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.324
What are you spitting
on the ground for?

05:45.400 --> 05:47.562
- What is that shit in your mouth?
- Chewing tobacco, sir.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.563
- it's what?!
- Chewing tobacco, sir!

05:49.640 --> 05:52.849
What the hell are you doing,
chewing tobacco in your mouth?

05:53.160 --> 05:55.162
I don't know sir.
I chew when I play baseball.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.971
Do you think this looks like
a baseball stadium?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.724
- No sir, it doesn't.
- Then what the hell...

05:59.800 --> 06:02.565
are you chewing tobacco for?
You got on the wrong fucking train?

06:02.640 --> 06:05.530
- Or did they draft you?
- No, sir. I enlisted, sir.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.604
- You did what?!
- I enlisted in the marines, sir.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.803
What the hell did you do
a thing like that for?!

06:12.640 --> 06:15.246
- Answer me, god dammit!
- I wanna be a marine, sir.

06:15.320 --> 06:16.924
What the hell for?

06:18.920 --> 06:21.400
- So I can fight for my country, sir.
- You fucking turd!

06:21.960 --> 06:24.691
Right now I can't stand
to look at you.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.604
Sergeant, get this shit
out of my fucking face.

06:27.760 --> 06:28.966
I'm Sgt. Loyce.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.123
I'm your drill instructor for the next
two fucking months, maggots.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.729
Jesus. How in the hell do they
expect me to train fucking marines...

06:35.800 --> 06:40.089
when they won't even send me
human goddamn beings to start with!

06:40.160 --> 06:43.209
Sergeant, get these fucking people
through receiving barracks.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.284
I'm gonna help you out. I don't wanna
drop any of their fucking civilian...

06:46.360 --> 06:48.761
slime on the way through. Jesus!

06:49.080 --> 06:52.721
When you are told to do so,
you will reach down by your right foot...

06:52.840 --> 06:56.640
...pick up your bags, empty the contents
on the table in front of you.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.323
You will empty your pockets and place
the contents of your pockets...

07:00.440 --> 07:01.805
on the table in front of you.

07:01.920 --> 07:02.967
Do it, now!

07:04.680 --> 07:06.125
What do you got
in your back pocket?

07:06.200 --> 07:08.646
- A diary.
- Contraband, get rid of it!

07:08.880 --> 07:12.965
What do you got in your pocket?
All right, Technicolor rubber.

07:13.160 --> 07:17.245
- I bet you're a virgin, aren't you?
- I lost it when I was 13.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.688
- What?
- I lost it when I was 13, sir!

07:20.760 --> 07:21.841
Contraband, get rid of it.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.884
- What's in the plastic there, private?
- Cookies from my girlfriend, sir.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.281
Bullshit, contraband,
put it on the table.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.085
Oh, what do we have here?
A little faggot, huh?

07:30.160 --> 07:32.970
Get your jewelry off there,
sweetheart, and put it on the table.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.089
What do you have in your
pocket there, lipstick?

07:36.720 --> 07:40.281
Jesus.
Put the goddamn thing on the table!

07:41.240 --> 07:43.322
You will answer
the following questions.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.404
Have you ever had any sexual act
with another man?

07:46.480 --> 07:49.211
With an animal?
Do you wet your bed?

07:49.320 --> 07:53.370
Do you like to wear women's clothing?
How often do you masturbate?

08:00.600 --> 08:02.568
- Where's your belt, private?
- What?

08:02.640 --> 08:05.564
- Where's your belt?
- Well, I don't know. Where's his?

08:05.640 --> 08:07.404
I'm asking you private.
Where's your belt?

08:07.480 --> 08:09.562
I must have left it in my bed.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.291
You get your belt and you better report
back to me when you're through.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.521
- You understand?
- Okay.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.921
- You get your belt too.
- Yes, sir.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.049
Unhook.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.689
Move it out, guys.
Get out there.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.410
Move it out.
Move it out.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.610
Go, go, go, go.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.160
Asshole!
Get up there.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.126
Move it up to the private
in front of you in file.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.283
Platoon 163 here.
First five privates, get on the chair.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.885
Move it up. Hurry!
We don't have all day, private.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.962
Move it up.
Hold it up there, little man.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.561
Get out of here.
Move.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.369
Move it up.
We're late.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.801
We don't have all day, ladies.
Anytime, anytime.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.609
Move it up.
Next five. Next five.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.410
Come on up, quickly!

09:14.360 --> 09:16.966
Get in here.
Get in there, Jesus.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.209
I want you to do a special job
on Jesus for me there, huh.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.287
Very nice.
Yeah.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.569
Do Jesus real good there for me.
I want to see Jesus' bald head.

09:28.840 --> 09:30.330
Huh, Jesus? Huh?

09:30.600 --> 09:31.886
Very cute.

09:32.880 --> 09:33.927
Sexy.

09:34.800 --> 09:35.961
Very nice.

09:36.840 --> 09:37.921
Cute.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.442
Try to stay in step with the private
in front of you.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.005
Keep your head always up.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.090
Move it up.
Get in there.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.806
Move. Move. Move.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.641
All right, you maggots.
Listen up.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.611
We're gonna say
your Marine Corps prayer.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.251
You will repeat after me.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.328
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

10:02.600 --> 10:06.491
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

10:06.720 --> 10:10.566
I will fear no evil...

10:10.880 --> 10:14.601
for I am the biggest, baddest,
meanest motherfucker in the valley.

10:14.680 --> 10:19.049
For I am the biggest, baddest
meanest motherfucker in the valley.

10:19.240 --> 10:23.450
When I tell you to prepare to mount
you will say "Prepare to mount" after me.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.124
You're will say "Aye, aye, sir."

10:25.200 --> 10:28.090
Then you will do it
as I give you the command.

10:28.160 --> 10:32.563
- Prepare to mount.
- Prepare to mount, aye, aye, sir.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.201
Do it.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.086
At attention worms.
At attention.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.044
You will repeat after me.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.881
- Gung ho.
- Gung ho.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.167
- Louder!
- Gung ho!

10:46.280 --> 10:48.647
- Gung ho.
- Gung ho.

10:49.360 --> 10:55.686
- Good night, Chesty, wherever you are.
- Good night, Chesty, wherever you are.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.367
Revelry you at 0430.

10:58.440 --> 11:01.011
You boneheads go to sleep.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.568
Who the fuck is Chesty?

11:10.160 --> 11:11.605
Who's gung ho?

11:17.160 --> 11:19.925
Hey, what do you think,
we're gonna get to shoot tomorrow?

11:20.000 --> 11:24.244
Oh, great, they got bizzaro over there,
one of those gung ho types.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.088
Hey, what the hell is that?

11:28.880 --> 11:31.087
It's the only paper
I could find to write on.

11:31.160 --> 11:32.161
Oh, yeah?

11:32.240 --> 11:35.164
Tell me, what are you writing,
a note to your asshole?

11:36.200 --> 11:39.602
- No, it's sort of like a journal, sort of.
- Oh, a journal, huh?

11:40.440 --> 11:43.205
Why don't you write in your notebook
or something like that?

11:43.280 --> 11:45.567
You saw them,
they took my notebook.

11:45.680 --> 11:46.886
They did?

11:47.800 --> 11:51.407
What's that under your pillow then,
Swiss cheese? What?

11:52.720 --> 11:54.563
- Hey, that's it.
- Hey...

11:54.960 --> 11:56.405
This is mine.
This is my notebook.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.891
That's right.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.729
- Hey, how'd you get it?
- I don't reveal my sources.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.849
I didn't register because I figured
if they got you, they got you.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.729
If they don't, they don't.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.165
Well, they got me.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.491
I guess that's my karma
coming out the Marines.

12:12.560 --> 12:13.891
Shoot

12:14.280 --> 12:18.444
I knew the Army could draft you, but
did you know the Marines can draft you?

12:18.520 --> 12:23.208
The guy at the recruiting office told me
that if I can prove myself as a writer...

12:23.280 --> 12:25.681
he could get me assigned
to public information in the Marines.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.568
- Oh, yeah?
- Right.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.729
So I can write about all the stuff
we do around here. And then...

12:29.800 --> 12:32.929
if we get sent to Vietnam
I can get into combat information...

12:33.000 --> 12:34.604
...write about the war.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.045
- Combat?
- Yeah.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.885
- You wanna get into combat?
- I'm gonna write about it.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.566
What, are you kidding me?
Listen, I'll tell you something.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.325
The only thing I wanna get into is
how I'm gonna get the hell out of here.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.562
And Vinnie Fazio is
gonna get his ass out of here.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.166
- Out of boot camp?
- Yeah, out of boot camp.

12:49.240 --> 12:52.050
- Good luck.
- Good luck?

12:52.240 --> 12:53.765
Hey, listen.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.604
You gotta know the angles.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.682
I've seen a golf range
on the base on the way in.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.001
All the hoi polloi use the golf range.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.050
All you gotta do is move in,
get with the people that can help you.

13:03.120 --> 13:04.724
That's what I'm talking about.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.203
Well, you're gonna have
to do it without me.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.849
I'm not going.
I'm getting out of here.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.888
- I'm not killing anybody.
- Hey...

13:12.960 --> 13:14.803
What's the matter with you,
you chicken?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.120
Shit.

13:18.760 --> 13:19.807
Pussy.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.369
Hey, what are you doing, son?

13:23.480 --> 13:24.606
And what are you doing, son?

13:24.680 --> 13:26.603
You're gonna get warts, boy?

13:26.680 --> 13:28.330
Hey, stop shouting, you jerk!

13:28.400 --> 13:30.164
Jerkin' himself off!

13:30.240 --> 13:31.685
Give me back my blanket.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.091
Shut up!

13:38.560 --> 13:42.007
You listen to me dip shit.
And I ain't gonna repeat myself.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.208
Don't mess with me.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.487
Don't mess near me.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.483
Don't bring no heat down on me.

13:48.920 --> 13:52.641
You're all headed for a fall and
I ain't taking the ride. Do you dig?

13:53.040 --> 13:55.884
You just stay clear of Tyrone.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.570
Because your all a bunch of fuck ups.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.128
And you're all gonna die.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.926
Every last one of you.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.727
You too, dipshit.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.451
Platoon 163.

14:54.640 --> 14:59.601
Sir, Platoon 163.
Aye, aye sir.

14:59.680 --> 15:00.920
Get on the road.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.368
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

15:06.440 --> 15:08.124
Hurry up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.440
What are you doing on my grass,
private, huh?!

15:11.520 --> 15:13.010
Move, move, move.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.084
You wanna rest on that grass?
Get in line!

15:17.320 --> 15:18.924
Move it down.
Move it down.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.650
Oh, what do we have here?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.370
Nice fucking move sweetheart.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.290
When we come out of the village
we're fully dressed, you understand me?

15:25.400 --> 15:26.686
Do I make myself clear?!

15:26.760 --> 15:28.410
Oh, Christ, my nuts!

15:29.720 --> 15:32.200
- Do you like your nuts?
- Let go, man, what are you doing?!

15:32.280 --> 15:33.930
You don't talk to me like that.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.650
- Do you like your nuts?
- Yeah.

15:35.720 --> 15:36.926
- You want some?
- Shit, yeah.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.889
- Do you wanna keep them?
- Yeah.

15:38.960 --> 15:42.203
All of you son of a bitches,
grab your fucking nuts.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.248
Right now, grab your nuts!

15:44.440 --> 15:45.805
You too, you freak.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.088
All of you guys grab your nuts.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.322
- Grab your fucking nuts.
- Get a hold of them.

15:50.400 --> 15:54.689
- Do you like them?
- Yes, sir.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.922
- Do they feel good to you?
- Yes, sir.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.685
If you fucking guys
wanna keep them son of a bitches...

15:59.760 --> 16:02.206
...you better listen to your
drill instructors.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.725
I'm trying to help you keep them.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.082
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

16:06.400 --> 16:10.200
Do you think your girlfriends is gonna
love it if you come back without them?

16:10.320 --> 16:11.082
No, sir.

16:11.160 --> 16:15.290
If you come back without your balls
they're gonna find another guy.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.249
Did you understand
what I'm saying to you?

16:17.320 --> 16:18.207
Yes, sir!

16:18.520 --> 16:21.000
I've got eight weeks to train you...

16:21.120 --> 16:24.249
to think, to act, to be one.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.408
I'll have to make you
depend on each other.

16:29.080 --> 16:32.448
I have to make you
a fighting Marines unit.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.969
Look around you.
You like the man next to you?

16:36.360 --> 16:40.206
You think he's a nigger or
that one's a Jew or that one's a spik!

16:40.680 --> 16:42.205
I don't care.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.961
That motherfucker
is gonna save your life one day!

16:45.560 --> 16:48.370
And you better depend on you buddy.
And you're buddy's buddy.

16:49.360 --> 16:52.523
- You understand what I'm saying to you?
- Yes, sir.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.051
Sergeant!

16:54.720 --> 16:56.927
Explain your two tours
to these people...

16:57.000 --> 16:59.890
and clean this shit off
the fucking street.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.931
I spent 26 months in Vietnam.

17:03.360 --> 17:06.204
And I can tell you
right goddamn now, privates...

17:06.280 --> 17:09.568
if you don't pay attention to what's
happening here in the recruit training...

17:09.640 --> 17:14.567
and learn, you're gonna come back from
Vietnam in a goddamn plastic body bag.

17:14.960 --> 17:19.363
Right now the casualty rate for
young Marines is over 50 percent.

17:19.640 --> 17:24.487
If you don't pay attention, you are
gonna be that private in the body bag.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.531
September 1, 1967.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.569
We can't seem to do anything right.

17:29.880 --> 17:33.043
In fact, half of us don't even know
our right from our left.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.966
Sgt. Loyce says if Uncle Sam
is counting on our platoon...

17:37.040 --> 17:40.283
to win the war for him,
he's betting on the wrong side.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.442
Without my rifle I am useless.

17:47.240 --> 17:50.881
Undoubtedly, you people have set
some kind of a new record today.

17:50.960 --> 17:54.043
You have fucked over
these weapons so goddamn bad...

17:54.120 --> 17:56.168
they'll probably never fire again!

17:56.240 --> 17:57.287
Let's move.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.528
Oh, come on, baby, pull that out.
Get out of here!

18:07.040 --> 18:07.882
Peace!

18:07.960 --> 18:09.041
Kill, kill, kill!

18:10.520 --> 18:12.841
Come on, Alvin.
Protect yourself, Alvin.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.569
Alvin, get up, get up.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.324
- Come on man, get up now.
- Come on Alvin, get up.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.208
Protect yourself!

18:18.280 --> 18:20.487
Come on Alvin, get up.
Protect yourself.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.321
- Pop it!
- Hey, man!

18:22.400 --> 18:24.448
Why'd you get on my foot, boy?

18:25.880 --> 18:28.201
All right, move it up.
Quickly. Quickly.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.683
Jesus, get your ass back there.
Go over that goddamn bar.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.607
Let see a little goddamn teamwork.
Quickly!

18:34.680 --> 18:36.603
God damn it, you're in combat!

18:36.680 --> 18:38.921
AK-47s are firing over your head.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.765
They'll tear your asshole
the size of a goddamn basketball.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.368
Move it up.
Get over there. Get over there.

18:44.640 --> 18:48.281
- How's my time, sir?
- Good work, but you lost, dummy.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.409
You left the half of your goddamn
platoon behind the enemy lines!

18:51.480 --> 18:53.130
Come on, get moving.
Don't wait.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.804
Don't you wait for him.
Shit!

18:54.880 --> 18:57.042
Faster private!

18:57.120 --> 19:01.045
God damn it, Washington, you just
put two private's on a trip wire.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.482
You just wiped out everybody
in a 50 meter radius, you dummy.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.561
You wiped me out!

19:05.760 --> 19:06.761
Go!

19:07.720 --> 19:09.449
God damn it, teamwork.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.249
You're all dead!

19:11.480 --> 19:14.245
Get in the fucking water.
Get in the water.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.288
Get in the fucking water.

19:16.360 --> 19:17.441
You're all dead.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.885
Get over there Washington, quickly.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.405
You're dead!

19:21.000 --> 19:23.685
The VC just heard you
and you're dead!

19:23.840 --> 19:25.490
And you can thank that man.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.843
Washington, you're instructors
have been telling you for weeks...

19:28.920 --> 19:32.686
...to pull together, pull together.
But he let you get wiped out.

19:32.760 --> 19:35.445
That's all it takes,
one fuck up.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.368
You look like shit.

19:40.560 --> 19:45.521
So I'm going to give you a shit detail
that will help you pull together.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.363
Let's get this goddamn aircraft loaded.
Let's get this aircraft loaded.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.202
Get them moving.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.202
Hey, Billy Ray Pike.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.240
Billy the Vile.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.882
Damn, you ain't Smoke Spaulding,
are you?

20:03.960 --> 20:06.361
In the flesh, bro, in the flesh.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.886
You know, I got me
a nice soft desk job here.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.043
I'm the company clerk. You know,
I thought that was your name I saw...

20:12.120 --> 20:14.521
- on that telegram I got the other day.
- What telegram?

20:14.600 --> 20:16.682
Your D.l.'s got it, man.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.809
Betsy's up at Ocean side,
and the Marines...

20:19.880 --> 20:22.121
- Wait man, Betsy's here?
- What a hole in the wall!

20:22.240 --> 20:24.686
- Full of sailors.
- Shit man. She might need me bad.

20:24.760 --> 20:27.001
Hey man, you gotta...
Can I get to see her?

20:27.120 --> 20:28.849
- Can you give me a pass?
- Hold your horses.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.922
Don't get your balls in an uproar.
Look...

20:31.040 --> 20:33.884
I gotta take some stuff op tomorrow
and I'm gonna a private to help me...

20:36.520 --> 20:37.885
Goddamn shit.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.530
Oh, my god!
Christ Almighty!

20:40.640 --> 20:42.130
Shit! God, no!

20:52.400 --> 20:55.051
- Who's in charge here?
- The Lieutenant, sir.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.770
The Lieutenant.
Is that your Lieutenant?

20:56.840 --> 20:58.205
Leave me. Leave me.
Get away.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.608
- Are you all right?
- Alvin...

21:02.840 --> 21:04.808
- What the hell.
- I'm okay, nothing happened.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.731
Damn bastards.
Just trying to make fools of us.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.768
I knew they were just
trying to scare us.

21:09.840 --> 21:13.128
They did a good job on you, Billy Ray.
You almost pissed in your pants.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.201
Bullshit.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.444
Good afternoon, Lieutenant.
What seems to be going on here?

21:17.520 --> 21:20.364
Well, sir, it looks like we just
wiped out your entire platoon here.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.727
We got an airplane
and two trucks beside.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.161
Now, sir, I'm afraid
there has been mistake.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.924
These people die at my command.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.085
Excuse me, you gentlemen are all dead.
Will you please lie down?

21:31.920 --> 21:34.207
I'm their drill instructor.
This a recruit platoon...

21:34.280 --> 21:35.884
Are you all right?

21:36.200 --> 21:38.885
All right? Hey, I knew they were
blanks the whole time.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.884
El Toro called up and they said
they had an emergency shipment...

21:41.960 --> 21:44.327
...that had to go to Vietnam.
I volunteered my privates...

21:44.400 --> 21:46.721
to come up here and now
they are involved in some kind...

21:46.800 --> 21:49.451
- of a silly ass war game.
- Excuse me, sir.

21:49.520 --> 21:50.646
This is not a game.

21:50.720 --> 21:55.726
This is an advance combat tactical
exercise and these men are all dead.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.167
Now, lay down, that's an order!

21:58.240 --> 22:00.368
Come here, Lieutenant.
May I have a word with you?

22:00.440 --> 22:02.442
You're dead. You're dead.
Get down.

22:02.520 --> 22:03.806
Get down!

22:10.320 --> 22:12.209
What is all this stuff anyway?

22:12.280 --> 22:16.490
- HQ111 Marine Air Force, Da Nang.
- RVN. What's RVN?

22:16.680 --> 22:18.170
Republic of Vietnam.

22:18.360 --> 22:20.931
This stuff is going to Vietnam, Alvin.
What is this?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.161
Ouch!

22:23.560 --> 22:25.085
What the hell is this?

22:25.160 --> 22:26.207
I don't know.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.129
Hey, Fazio.

22:28.320 --> 22:30.607
- Foster, what is this stuff?
- We don't know.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.523
I think it's a giant rubber.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.967
Put it over your head,
Pike, you're a big prick.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.320
Shit.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.449
Hey, look here, man.
Looks like an airbag or something.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.124
I don't think so.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.922
Hey, I got it, you sleep in it.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.571
It's a lightweight, sleeping bag.
Look at this!

22:48.520 --> 22:51.683
Hey, look at this.
It's for sleeping, man.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.171
I can sleep all night in this thing.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.080
Hey, Billy...

22:55.280 --> 22:59.330
Billy, if you fall asleep in that,
you won't wake up.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.851
It says it's a body bag.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.963
What's a body bag?

23:04.040 --> 23:07.761
What's a body bag?
That's what they ship the stiffs in.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.604
Damn, the zipper is stuck.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.761
Get me out of here.
Get me out!

23:13.960 --> 23:15.962
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, take it easy.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.121
Hey, Alvin, are you still writing
about that creepy shit?

23:34.200 --> 23:36.885
Listen, I'm gonna show this
to the public information officer.

23:36.960 --> 23:39.804
This is a story
I can really say something about.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.048
I mean, the way they stick somebody
in one of those bags...

23:42.120 --> 23:44.248
...seal it up and send it off?

23:44.600 --> 23:47.171
It's like a neat little convenient
package.

23:47.360 --> 23:50.330
And nobody even thinks
about what's inside.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.720
Yeah?

23:51.880 --> 23:53.962
Nobody ever looks inside.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.843
Alvin, Alvin, look at this.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.969
This is that driving range I was
telling you about. Look at this.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.566
And look, look at the full bird
colonel out there.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.325
And look at the legs
on the chick his playing with.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.210
Well, I'm gonna be that guy's Caddie.
I'm not fooling around here, no more.

24:12.280 --> 24:13.930
- Hey, Vinnie, no, no...
- Hey, hey, listen...

24:14.000 --> 24:15.684
You only got one shot, right?

24:15.760 --> 24:18.366
I mean, it's not like you got forever,
you know what I mean?

24:18.440 --> 24:21.887
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Okay, see you.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.644
Take it easy, man.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.291
Stupid motherfucker.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.402
What else can we do?

24:33.200 --> 24:34.281
You know...

24:34.360 --> 24:35.691
You see...

24:36.600 --> 24:39.888
I heard about, you know,
down in Tijuana...

24:40.360 --> 24:43.125
they got real doctors.
They ain't like it as here.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.850
You're allowed to...

24:45.160 --> 24:46.764
You know. I mean...

24:47.520 --> 24:50.967
- I can get the money.
- I have the money.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.211
It's just ain't the right time now.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.931
It's just not the right time.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.409
You see?

25:08.720 --> 25:10.245
I see.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.048
Baby...

25:17.760 --> 25:19.762
I gotta go.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.288
Please don't leave yet.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.881
Halt. Who goes there?
Hey, you!

25:32.960 --> 25:35.770
Goddamn! Oh, Goddamn!

25:35.840 --> 25:37.490
Jesus!

25:37.840 --> 25:39.808
You son of a bitch,
you didn't have to shoot me.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.644
Well, you scared
the shit out of me, asshole.

25:41.720 --> 25:42.721
Goddamn!

25:46.840 --> 25:51.164
Sir, here are the agents of Hanoi who
have come to fuck the Marine Corps, sir.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.402
Which one is the Dago, Fazio?

25:55.000 --> 25:56.525
Ain't he the cute one?

25:56.600 --> 25:59.809
It says here, he was trying to get his
end in with the Colonel's daughter...

25:59.880 --> 26:01.450
...out on the driving range.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.409
Let me tell you this, private.

26:03.480 --> 26:06.370
We'll take care of your
overactive sex drive in here.

26:07.040 --> 26:11.125
We got us a Foster, Alvin,
apprehended by public information...

26:11.200 --> 26:13.965
...for disseminating classified
and subversive material.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.883
- No, sir, that was...
- Quiet, Billy Ray.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.404
AWOL and resisting arrest.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.482
Sir, private's wounded, sir.

26:20.560 --> 26:24.565
Quit your whining you candy ass turd!
You ain't got nothing but a scratch!

26:24.640 --> 26:27.325
And you, what are you doing
bleeding all over my floor?

26:27.400 --> 26:31.007
Sir, this prisoner
is by nature a filthy hippie.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.651
He was trying to desert,
but he was so high on marijuana...

26:33.720 --> 26:36.451
that he tripped and fell
into the barbed wire, sir.

26:36.520 --> 26:37.806
That's a lie.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.208
I'm sorry.
That's a lie, sir.

26:42.280 --> 26:44.442
Don't you wanna be
n the Marine Corps, Private?

26:45.200 --> 26:47.601
Don't you want
to fight for your country?

26:47.680 --> 26:52.561
Sir, the war in Vietnam
is a purely, internal, civil war.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.723
- Do you believe that crap?
- Yes, I believe that.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.969
You're all fucking communists.
Sergeant...

26:59.040 --> 27:02.761
Get this faggots out here. See if you
can teach them how to walk around...

27:02.840 --> 27:05.320
without falling down and
hurting themselves all the time.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.007
About face!
Move out!

27:24.000 --> 27:27.561
Hey, there Jethro, what for
they stick us in this outfit?

27:27.640 --> 27:32.089
They got more niggers in this platoon
than the Oakland fucking Raiders.

27:33.160 --> 27:37.245
Sambo, why don't you get some of that
whitewash on your black ass there?

27:39.960 --> 27:42.850
Hey, boy, what you going
inside for there, boy?

27:42.920 --> 27:45.605
I thought the hot sun
don't bother you.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.801
Sir, Private Washington requests
permission to speak with...

27:50.880 --> 27:52.848
- the drill instructor, sir.
- Speak.

27:52.920 --> 27:56.367
Sir, Private Washington requesting
permission to enter the duty office, sir.

27:56.760 --> 27:57.841
Enter.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.405
Sit down.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.408
You've met our four new
replacements yet?

28:05.480 --> 28:07.926
Their drill instructors call them
the four fucking stooges.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.287
Replacements?
Man, I ain't no fool.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.329
Those fucks won't last
a week out there.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.722
And anybody who's gotta depend
on them is already dead meat.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.366
I don't believe that.

28:17.440 --> 28:21.286
But I'll tell you what, Washington.
I respect your judge of character.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.045
You think they're anymore fucked ups
in the rest of the shit we got in this...

28:24.120 --> 28:25.531
- goddamn platoon?
- No, shit.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.688
Why don't you just march
the whole fucking platoon right here...

28:27.760 --> 28:29.603
blow their damn brains out right here...

28:29.680 --> 28:31.284
cause you're gonna end up
killing all of us.

28:31.360 --> 28:34.682
I'm not the goddamn one, Washington,
that's killing these people.

28:34.760 --> 28:37.161
It's you, asshole.
You're the one!

28:37.240 --> 28:39.368
- Not me.
- That's bullshit. That's Bullshit.

28:39.440 --> 28:40.771
That's bullshit!

28:40.840 --> 28:42.763
Let me tell you something,
Washington.

28:43.240 --> 28:46.528
I've got one hell of a shitty
goddamn job here.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.809
They send me 60 to 80 buckets
of civilian shit...

28:50.160 --> 28:53.801
and expect me to train them to become
combat-goddamn-ready marines.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.611
I've got to send these people
to Vietnam.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.523
I'm the one that has to send them.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.089
They're gonna come back in bags.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.525
They're gonna come back in
wheelchairs.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.647
They're gonna be maimed.

29:03.760 --> 29:06.809
They're gonna be fucked up people
when they come back.

29:07.160 --> 29:09.367
It's up to me how they come back.

29:09.440 --> 29:13.126
And you, asshole,
Washington, you're not motivated.

29:13.200 --> 29:17.125
You're not motivated at all.
You can fucking help me.

29:18.080 --> 29:19.081
But no, hell no.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.925
You've got your goddamn
head up your ass all the time.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.924
You're playing your own
silly ass goddamn game.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.050
But I tell you one thing, hippie,
you're gonna start playing my game...

29:29.160 --> 29:32.323
or you're gonna find yourself
in combat in Vietnam...

29:32.400 --> 29:34.448
and you're gonna have Charlie
shooting at you from the front...

29:34.520 --> 29:37.205
and the four Stooges are gonna be
shooting at you from the rear.

29:37.280 --> 29:40.011
Sir, are you talking to me
man to man?

29:40.320 --> 29:41.810
Yeah, I'm talking to you,
man to man.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.611
Then will you remove your hat, sir
so I could face you eye to eye.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.047
I don't mind at all, Washington,
if it's gonna help you out.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.690
Okay, sir, what do you want me
to do, huh?

29:48.760 --> 29:51.240
I mean, what the fuck
do you want me to do, man?

29:51.320 --> 29:53.163
You want me to...
You want me to be a good nigger...

29:53.240 --> 29:56.369
so you can march those boys
out of the brig, is that it?

29:56.480 --> 30:00.690
No, Washington, I don't want...
Goddamn, I don't want a good nigger!

30:00.840 --> 30:04.083
I want a goddamn man
that's out there pushing these people.

30:04.160 --> 30:07.721
Somebody they can trust, somebody
that they know is trying to help them.

30:07.800 --> 30:11.282
I want somebody
that they can count on in Vietnam.

30:11.360 --> 30:13.124
I don't want them to be afraid
to fall down...

30:13.200 --> 30:15.407
because they know somebody's
behind them to pick them up

30:15.480 --> 30:17.721
and stand them back up
on their goddamn feet.

30:18.760 --> 30:22.003
I got eight fucking weeks
to teach these goddamn people...

30:22.080 --> 30:24.048
what it took you to 20 years
to learn on the streets.

30:24.120 --> 30:27.090
Now, you show me
that kind of a goddamn nigger...

30:27.160 --> 30:30.528
and I'll give you a platoon
that will stand by you.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.803
A platoon that will save your ass
in combat, Washington.

30:33.880 --> 30:35.723
And they will
save their own asses, too.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.167
Teamwork, goddamn it.
Teamwork.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.765
Yes, sir.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.565
Sir...

30:47.800 --> 30:49.484
Can you get them back?

30:49.560 --> 30:53.645
Yeah, I can get them back. But I'll you
one fucking thing right now, hippie.

30:53.840 --> 30:56.571
You start this lone wolf shit
again on me...

30:56.640 --> 30:59.769
and I'll stick you with a maggoty ass
bunch of goddamn shit...

30:59.840 --> 31:02.684
you've ever seen in your life.
You are bound to get fucking killed...

31:02.760 --> 31:05.445
in the first week in Vietnam.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.171
Get them back.

31:09.240 --> 31:12.722
- I got your goddamn word?
- You got my goddamn word.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.290
All right.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.323
Go out there and get rid of that...

31:18.400 --> 31:22.803
Those four fucking scumbags.
Send them beck where the fuck they came from...

31:22.880 --> 31:24.803
and I'll go down to the brig
and I'll pull some strings...

31:24.880 --> 31:27.486
- and I'll get our people back.
- Thank you. Sir.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.922
You don't have to thank me.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.725
Oh, shit.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.561
Hey, boys, here comes our
pickaninny friend again.

31:37.640 --> 31:40.325
What's the matter boy, they quit
giving away fried chicken in there?

31:40.400 --> 31:43.006
Excuse me sir, but do you mind moving
your asshole downwind of me?

31:43.080 --> 31:45.208
- You said what?
- Oh, I'm sorry, that's your mouth.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.851
I didn't see the teeth. Hey man,
anybody could have made a mistake.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.931
October 7, 1967.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.889
Now we can't seem
to do anything wrong.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.849
We're good and we know it.

32:08.040 --> 32:11.522
We're the biggest, baddest,
meanest mothers in the valley.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.882
I still don't know
if we can win the war single-handed.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.247
But I feel sorry for anyone
who gets in our way.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.767
Harch!

32:19.600 --> 32:21.602
Rifle salute.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.923
Harch!

32:25.320 --> 32:27.641
Arms at ease!

32:29.320 --> 32:32.005
Perfect. Perfect.
Outstanding, girls.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.370
Haarch!

32:38.080 --> 32:40.242
Hold on in front,
you're running away.

to call you marines.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.806
At 1400 hours you will
receive your orders...

34:16.880 --> 34:19.645
assigning you to advance training.

34:20.440 --> 34:23.284
Due to an urgent demand
for additional Marine manpower...

34:23.360 --> 34:25.806
by the Navy's Mediterranean fleet...

34:26.280 --> 34:30.967
only half this series will be
assigned to combat duty in Vietnam.

34:31.080 --> 34:33.128
The other half will receive orders
for sea duty.

34:33.639 --> 34:37.326
Drill instructors take charge

34:40.400 --> 34:42.641
Attention.

Platoon 163 dismissed.

Platoon 163 dismissed!
Aye, aye, sir!

34:55.040 --> 34:56.849
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.

34:57.240 --> 35:00.005
Come on. You got a 50-50 chance
to go on a sea duty.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.050
What are you talking about? Buford's
been looking at me the same way...

35:03.160 --> 35:05.481
he looked when he found out
I was trying to hump his daughters.

35:05.560 --> 35:08.211
I wound up in the brig, right?
I'll only wind up in Vietnam.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.727
No, no, no, listen. He can't change
orders, they're already written.

35:11.920 --> 35:12.967
Honest, listen.

35:13.040 --> 35:16.328
In two weeks, you'll be in a beach
somewhere in Italy, take my word.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.925
God, sea duty.
I got to get it.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.128
All right, man. Well, just think
good thoughts. Think good karma...

35:20.200 --> 35:23.647
and you will get it man, sea duty.
Sea duty, think sea duty, you know.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.724
- Sea duty, sea duty, sea duty.
- Spaulding, man, he could swing it.

35:27.640 --> 35:30.883
Yeah, you say things
are dry on the street.

35:31.080 --> 35:34.721
Hey, man, well, before you know,
traffics gonna start to flow.

35:35.680 --> 35:40.811
It will be coming in on a C-130
and Uncle Sam is paying the postage.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.885
Is it safe?!

35:43.200 --> 35:46.761
Spoon, it's air-tight and waterproof.

35:46.960 --> 35:50.487
With Marine guards
and a band to boot.

35:51.120 --> 35:52.451
I love it.

35:52.760 --> 35:53.966
All right.

35:54.480 --> 35:56.164
You too, brother, easy.

35:56.480 --> 35:59.290
All right, last two people
for sea duty.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.289
Daugherty M.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.285
Fazio V.

36:03.360 --> 36:04.850
You did it! That's it!

36:04.960 --> 36:07.008
What's the matter, garlic breath,
you don't like boat?

36:07.080 --> 36:10.323
- You get seasick?
- Oh no, I love boats. I love boats!

36:10.400 --> 36:12.641
Boats, the Mediterranean Alvin!

36:13.120 --> 36:15.282
Sorry, Sir, but we got
a change of orders.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.768
- Private Vincent Fazio...
- Fazio, that's me.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.411
-I'm out of here man.
Signed by Colonel Buford...

36:20.480 --> 36:22.323
- a new friend of yours.
- Buford?

36:22.400 --> 36:25.961
Don't be getting your nut off yet,
private. Get back in formation.

36:26.040 --> 36:29.362
You are now an O-300.
Col. Buford doesn't like people...

36:29.440 --> 36:31.681
to come around and get
a little pussy off of his daughters.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.524
- What's O-300?
- He just changed your orders.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.490
- O-300, basic infantryman.
- Does that mean Vietnam?

36:36.560 --> 36:37.402
Yeah.

36:37.480 --> 36:40.404
Goddamn right, it means Vietnam,
numb nuts.

36:40.480 --> 36:44.166
Goddamn it,
O-300 is basic infantryman.

36:44.240 --> 36:48.689
O-3 fucking hundred
is the United States Marine corp.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.888
Goddamn, bag of shit.

36:50.960 --> 36:54.931
Now, I want you people over here
to get in this truck over here.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.368
We're going to Pendleton. And you,
people, from here on over...

36:58.440 --> 37:02.286
jump in the 6 by 8 it's by right here.
Quickly, let's get it done.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.249
Come on girls.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.808
Washington, come here.

37:09.120 --> 37:13.011
I just want you to know,
Washington, I'm watching you.

37:13.160 --> 37:16.209
You're under surveillance all
the time. You fuck up in Vietnam...

37:16.280 --> 37:18.044
somebody's gonna tell me.
I swear to god...

37:18.120 --> 37:20.088
I'll jump up on a goddamn
troop transport...

37:20.160 --> 37:24.324
and come over and straighten your
ass out. Now, get in the fucking truck.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.324
- Bye, girls.
- Bye, Sergeant.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.771
♫ I'm the sergeant,
Loyce's my name. ♫

37:37.840 --> 37:40.411
♫ Took the job 'coz he's insane. ♫

37:40.480 --> 37:42.881
♫ Stars and stripe,
they give me class. ♫

37:42.960 --> 37:45.042
♫ He just like to kick our ass. ♫

37:45.120 --> 37:47.851

37:58.920 --> 38:01.241
♫ Shipped our ass to Vietnam. ♫

38:01.320 --> 38:03.721
♫ Good marines, they never die. ♫

38:03.840 --> 38:06.320

♫ Sound off... ♫

38:14.240 --> 38:16.561
January 4, 1968.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.969
Vinnie finally got his boat ride.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.122
And I finally have some time
to catch up with my journal...

38:21.200 --> 38:25.000
after three tough months of advanced
training. The Marine Corp...

38:25.080 --> 38:28.004
prepared us for everything except
our new company commander.

38:28.080 --> 38:31.163
It's easy to see what's in your minds
as we steam for far-off angry shores.

38:31.240 --> 38:34.961
So I'd like to share with you some
figures that have come my way. Gunny?

38:35.920 --> 38:40.369
From 1961 until this past summer 1967,
only 13,000 Americans...

38:40.440 --> 38:43.762
have died in combat in Vietnam.
You, you step forward.

38:45.120 --> 38:45.928
That means...

38:46.520 --> 38:49.364
of the 110 men in C company,
the chances are only two...

38:49.440 --> 38:53.490
will die. I find that pretty
reassuring. Thank you, men.

38:54.320 --> 38:57.563
I have a theory as to why we aren't
doing as well as we might in Vietnam.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.850
Our thinking is shaped
by the games we grow up with.

39:00.920 --> 39:04.447
The VC don't play by our rules. They
grew up with a game that demands...

39:04.520 --> 39:06.966
constant movement
and fluid shifting strategy.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.522
Now while you're on the ship,
you will all learn to play their game.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.001
And, gentlemen,
their game is soccer.

39:13.440 --> 39:14.362
Soccer?

39:14.440 --> 39:16.522
Kiss my ass.

39:16.680 --> 39:19.331
All right, you catch up with the ball
and kick it into the goal...

39:19.400 --> 39:21.482
before it hits the white line.
You ready? You got to run. Go!

39:21.560 --> 39:23.688
Come on, Fazio. Go.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.450
Lt. Archer, sir?

39:28.240 --> 39:32.086
Sir, some of the men were talking
about Captain Collins' theory.

39:32.160 --> 39:35.130
And I was curious about
what you think of it.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.448
Well, Foster...

39:40.360 --> 39:42.840
I... I think it's bullshit.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.201
January 9, 1968.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.761
Maybe Lt. Archer is right
about the Captain 's theory...

39:48.840 --> 39:52.003
on how soccer can help us beat the
enemy. But at least, playing soccer...

39:52.080 --> 39:54.560
keeps us from thinking about
the Captain's other theory...

39:54.640 --> 39:58.361
and wondering if he's right that only
two guys in the company will die.

39:58.440 --> 40:01.046
Anyways, he's get me
keeping stats on the team...

40:01.120 --> 40:03.566
but I'm using the time to write
in this journal. Vinnie says...

40:03.640 --> 40:07.486
if I play my cards right, this journal
could prove my writing ability...

40:07.560 --> 40:10.484
and get me a desk job, behind
the lines, writing propaganda.

40:10.560 --> 40:14.167
But what I wanna do, is get in to
combat and write about the real thing.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.810
I guess I won't have to wait
much longer.

40:15.880 --> 40:19.362
We're docking at Cam Ranh Bay,
Republic of Vietnam.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.081
Hello, you darlings.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.162
Dave, how do you say
"how much"?

40:26.960 --> 40:31.090
- She says 300 Piestas.
- 300 Piestas? What am I, the bank?

40:31.600 --> 40:34.649
- How much is 300 Piestas?
- That's about three bucks.

40:35.480 --> 40:38.131
Three bucks... to get laid?!

40:38.200 --> 40:39.008
Hey!

40:39.720 --> 40:41.563
That's what I'm talking about!

40:43.040 --> 40:44.565
Come on, man.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.963
Keep your hands off my girl.

40:51.480 --> 40:52.527
Hey, watch it.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.724
You big asshole.

41:00.560 --> 41:04.531
General quarters.
All hands man your battle stations.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.570
Come on, come on, up.

41:06.680 --> 41:10.605
Look out, we're the bad ass boys of
Company C are coming to save you ass.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.728
Go, go, go.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.730
Move, move, move.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.962
Come on, come on, come on.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.523
Al! Al!
I got the price down to two bucks.

41:26.720 --> 41:29.849
What's the fuck is wrong with you?
Get out of here now! Let's move!

41:30.080 --> 41:31.081
- Wait.
- Move!

41:31.160 --> 41:32.366
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

41:33.640 --> 41:37.281
Goddamn it, come on!

41:37.760 --> 41:39.330
Leave it, damn it!

41:39.400 --> 41:41.004
Hurry! It's coming in here.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.650
Captain, in here!

41:54.920 --> 41:56.922
We've got to check
on transportation.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.368
Lieutenant, get them all there.
I gotta check on the transportation.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.169
Go on! In here, in here!
Move, move, move!

42:02.240 --> 42:05.722
Come, you guys, let's go.
Move it, line up. Come on, move.

42:05.800 --> 42:07.211
Move, line up!

42:07.280 --> 42:08.930
Let's go, let's go.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.366
Let's go, on the double!

42:12.440 --> 42:14.408
Get your ass inside there!

42:14.520 --> 42:15.407
Move!

42:15.640 --> 42:17.768
- OK, go back.
- Fazio, what the hell are doing?!

42:17.840 --> 42:21.049
- I got it down to one buck.
- Get the hell inside!

42:21.120 --> 42:22.963
Move people move.

42:23.320 --> 42:26.529
Pull in the rear. Attention!

42:27.320 --> 42:29.926
Now, drop your duffle bags.

42:32.720 --> 42:36.042
Drop your pants,
this won't last a second.

42:36.320 --> 42:39.881
I am going to have to insert this,
take a little sample.

42:39.960 --> 42:42.691
- It won't hurt.
- OK, I speak English.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.251
You've got cold hands, little lady.

42:47.320 --> 42:50.449
- It's Lieutenant.
- Sorry, Sir... Miss. Whatever.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.887
What's the fuck's going on here?

42:53.400 --> 42:56.006
With all due respect, sir,
this is an army matter.

42:56.080 --> 42:58.651
These people are under quarantine
and will not be returned to the States...

42:58.760 --> 43:00.888
until they've been checked
and treated for VD.

43:00.960 --> 43:03.725
We must consider the loved ones
and wives back home.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.723
That's absolute bullshit.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.962
- People, please put on your trousers.
- Sir, I said the right...

43:08.040 --> 43:12.648
Sergeant! These people just got
in the country five minutes ago!

43:12.720 --> 43:15.007
They're United States Marines,
not the goddamn army.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.208
Men, the airbase is shut down
by incoming rockets.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.687
Looks like we're gonna be
stranded here for a couple of days.

43:19.760 --> 43:23.162
Now, there is a vital army convoy
leaving for Long Khe in the morning.

43:23.240 --> 43:26.687
General Dearborne up there is goddamn
anxious to get it through safely...

43:26.760 --> 43:29.127
and I volunteered Company C
to ride shotgun.

43:29.200 --> 43:32.409
We're gonna show that Army General
what a few good Marines can do.

43:32.480 --> 43:34.482
Get in bed early.
We leave first thing in the morning.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.847
What the hell
are these nurses doing in here?

43:36.920 --> 43:39.321
- You won't believe me if I told you sir.
- Well get them out of here before...

43:39.400 --> 43:41.767
somebody jumps them,
for Chrissakes.

43:43.240 --> 43:45.607
January 10, 1968.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.888
The convoy staffed at dawn.

43:47.960 --> 43:50.691
Before we left, this army major
gave us a big speech...

43:50.760 --> 43:53.650
on how vital and urgent it was
to get the convoy through safely...

43:53.720 --> 43:56.087
to General Dearborne
up at Long Khe.

43:56.360 --> 43:58.601
The country is beautiful,
it's so quiet.

43:58.680 --> 44:00.523
It's herd to believe
there's a war going on.

44:01.360 --> 44:03.966
- Do you play guitar?
- Oh yeah, you kidding me?

44:04.600 --> 44:05.647
- Here.
- You do?

44:05.720 --> 44:07.961
- Hold on, Fazio.
- Hold my rifle for me.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.127
I got it.

44:09.240 --> 44:11.561
Come on, Tom, you and do me do
some blues. Give me some of that...

44:11.640 --> 44:12.801
West side Chicago stuff.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.685
Well, you play like
you've got some black in you.

44:20.560 --> 44:21.891
- He does.
- Come on, baby.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.442
♫ Hey, streets of Chicago... ♫

44:26.480 --> 44:29.086
♫ that gets cold at night... ♫

44:29.920 --> 44:32.571
♫ We've learned some good things... ♫

44:32.640 --> 44:35.211
♫ and it's good to learn to fly... ♫

44:35.680 --> 44:37.523
The pause that refreshes.

44:39.720 --> 44:41.768
While we were stopped,
the Captain spotted some...

44:41.840 --> 44:44.810
Vietnamese kicking a ball around
here. That was all he needed.

44:45.760 --> 44:48.923
Billy is really a hotshot.
The Captain calls him twinkle toes...

44:49.000 --> 44:52.482
and says with e star like Billy
we could put together e greet team.

44:53.240 --> 44:56.164
What good that would do us,
nobody seems to know.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.527
The Captain keeps getting lost.

44:58.600 --> 45:00.489
But we 're not complaining.

45:00.640 --> 45:03.371
And every time we stopped,
someone tries to sell us something.

45:04.240 --> 45:05.480
We're having a great time.

45:06.200 --> 45:09.443
But I just keep wondering about those
poor army guys sweating it out...

45:09.560 --> 45:11.130
waiting for us up at Long Khe.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.487
Get on that radio
and get a recovery vehicle down.

45:13.560 --> 45:15.881
And get this road clear
on the double. Do it now.

45:21.680 --> 45:24.524
I've got a working party. Get this
thing cleared in a minute, skipper.

45:24.600 --> 45:28.446
Don't touch anything at all. This whole
goddamn place could be boobied.

45:28.520 --> 45:30.090
We've got to get out of here.

45:30.160 --> 45:32.845
Hey, Alvin, goddamn it! Put
the camera away. Are you crazy?

45:33.600 --> 45:34.726
I don't like it.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.484
I don't like it at all,
we're sitting ducks.

45:36.560 --> 45:38.369
All right get back in here.
We're moving out, back it up!

45:38.440 --> 45:40.124
No, Captain, you're gonna
bunch us up!

45:40.200 --> 45:43.090
We can turn around in that clearing
and let's get the fuck out of here.

45:43.160 --> 45:44.730
- Go, go!
- Keep your interval.

45:44.800 --> 45:47.485
Do not bunch up.
Keep your distance.

45:48.800 --> 45:50.484
Back, back, back.

45:51.880 --> 45:54.724
All right, people, get down
and men the flanks.

45:56.160 --> 45:58.208
Keep your distance,
keep your distance.

45:58.280 --> 46:00.362
Don't bunch up.
Do not bunch up.

46:00.440 --> 46:02.841
Keep your interval.
You must keep your interval.

46:05.920 --> 46:07.968
Dismount, people, get out of here.

46:09.160 --> 46:10.969
Get the hell out of the way, damn it!

46:12.440 --> 46:13.771
Dismount, people.

46:13.840 --> 46:15.365
Keep your distance, people.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.367
Get on my shoulder man
and you be cool here.

46:21.440 --> 46:24.046
I'm gonna make a tourniquet for your
leg. And you hold on to it...

46:24.120 --> 46:26.248
you hold it tight, or you're gonna die!

46:34.320 --> 46:36.527
I see him. You wanna fight?

46:36.600 --> 46:39.729
Come on, Lieutenant,
let's stay on this motherfucker.

46:41.440 --> 46:44.842
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

46:46.280 --> 46:49.762
Delta 1, this is Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, please. Over.

46:50.440 --> 46:53.330
Delta 1, this is Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, please. Over.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.880
The boys have been hit hard.
Better call the MEDEVAC in.

46:55.960 --> 46:58.566
No time for a goddamn MEDEVAC.
We're getting the shit blown out of us.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.768
If I don't get some air cover,
we will be blasted.

47:24.840 --> 47:27.207
You son of a bitch!

47:29.280 --> 47:30.486
Asshole!

47:31.080 --> 47:33.606
You... you motherfucking goop!

47:35.160 --> 47:38.084
Delta 5, this Bravo Alpha 5.
Come in, over.

47:38.240 --> 47:41.449
- Where's my RTO?
- He got hit, skipper.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.091
I don't believe this.
Delta 1, this is Bravo Alpha 5.

47:44.160 --> 47:44.968
Come in, over!

47:45.720 --> 47:47.404
He's gone.

47:48.040 --> 47:49.963
Must have had a tunnel.

47:54.120 --> 47:56.043
Lieutenant, you're sure
he's not still there?

47:56.120 --> 47:58.646
What the hell do you mean,
are you sure he's not still there, man?

47:58.720 --> 48:01.803
You come bursting across the damn
field with that big ass gun.

48:01.880 --> 48:03.882
We had him trapped,
we had him cornered.

48:03.960 --> 48:06.088
We were gonna maim
that motherfucker.

48:06.360 --> 48:08.408
One MEDEVAC is not is
not enough, goddamn it!

48:08.480 --> 48:12.041
We're bleeding, we need more! Why
can't I get what I want around here?!

48:12.120 --> 48:14.202
Jesus christ!

48:14.440 --> 48:15.851
Captain!

48:16.200 --> 48:18.646
- You got your two dead men.
- Easy, private.

48:18.720 --> 48:21.326
Private, I don't have to take that shit
from you. Now listen to me!

48:21.400 --> 48:25.564
It could not be helped. This is a war and
people die! Now we got a job to do.

48:25.680 --> 48:29.526
We are taking a convoy to Long Khe
and it's vital and it's urgent.

48:29.640 --> 48:34.009
This convoy will save hundreds of men
and two lives are a small price to pay!

48:34.120 --> 48:35.485
- Easy, baby.
- Bullshit!

48:35.640 --> 48:37.608
- Bullshit?!
- Bullshit, Captain!

48:37.720 --> 48:39.131
At ease!

48:40.400 --> 48:42.721
Is that your fucking vital supply, sir?

48:44.040 --> 48:46.486
How many lives is this gonna save?

48:46.600 --> 48:47.840
You son a bitch!

48:51.440 --> 48:52.805
We're dying out here...

48:52.920 --> 48:57.528
so that some shit bird general
can have his fucking pork steak!

48:58.960 --> 49:00.962
Come on. Take it easy.

49:11.680 --> 49:14.490
We must be having
a vital and urgent sale...

49:14.560 --> 49:17.086
a vital and urgent sale
at the PX, huh, Captain?!

49:19.760 --> 49:21.842
Out, out! Get it all out.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.926
Happy birthday, Gen. Dearborne.

49:30.080 --> 49:32.208
Here is your new
mobile whorehouse.

49:32.320 --> 49:34.448
Compliments of Charlie Company!

49:37.400 --> 49:39.801
Was it worth all this, Captain?
Was it worth it?

49:39.880 --> 49:40.802
I didn't know.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.848
Is it the Captain's job
to kill his own men?!

49:42.920 --> 49:45.571
- Son of a bitch!
- The Major told me it was urgent.

49:45.640 --> 49:49.929
- I didn't know! Son of a bitch!
- Come on. We gotta call in...

49:50.000 --> 49:54.449
I didn't know! God damn it.
What the fuck? I did not know!

49:55.800 --> 49:58.371
I never saw a dead body before.

49:58.640 --> 50:00.051
They look real small.

50:01.400 --> 50:03.209
You've never seen a stiff, huh?

50:04.600 --> 50:06.887
- Did you?
- Yeah.

50:08.840 --> 50:13.209
Well, not in real life, you know.
Just... on TV.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.771
It's not the same.

50:17.360 --> 50:19.647
January 11, 1968.

50:19.720 --> 50:22.769
Our vital Army convoy finally got
through to the U.S. Army Base...

50:22.840 --> 50:25.730
at Long Khe.
General Dearborne commanding.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.769
The Captain says that since
we've shown the general...

50:27.840 --> 50:31.731
what e few good marines can do,
he's given us 24 hours liberty.

50:31.840 --> 50:34.923
T24 hours to eat,
drink, smoke and screw.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.890
After what we've been through,
I don't know if we've got the energy.

50:38.440 --> 50:41.683
But I know we left two guys back there
who'd have wished they had a chance.

50:41.800 --> 50:43.962
Hey, do you want to buy
some ears, man?

50:44.040 --> 50:46.566
I'm just glad I'll never be able to see
the sorry looking bunch...

50:46.640 --> 50:48.847
of Army fuck-ups
that they died for.

50:48.920 --> 50:52.003
Look at this!
Esther Williams Swimming Pool...

50:52.080 --> 50:54.321
Beauty Parlor and Bowling.

50:54.400 --> 50:55.925
That figures.

50:56.080 --> 50:58.481
Hey, Albert. Albert!
The Nikon's here.

50:58.560 --> 51:00.483
Trade in that toy now
and get a real camera.

51:00.560 --> 51:01.527
I think I'm gonna.

51:01.600 --> 51:04.365
Madame Cocos Steam Bath,
Massage and Health Club!

51:04.440 --> 51:06.408
- Where?
- Follow the arrows.

51:06.480 --> 51:10.087
- That's nothing. Look at here.
- Prime Cut Steak House...

51:10.160 --> 51:14.290
home of Armed Force Television,
Channel 4, movie theater, snack bar.

51:14.360 --> 51:17.091
Hey, man, now that ain't gonna be se
bad. Everything you ever wanted...

51:17.160 --> 51:20.209
in a whole fucking world
is right here, on this base.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.726
Hey man, I wonder where
the Base Hospital is?

51:22.800 --> 51:24.211
Let's get out of here.

51:24.280 --> 51:26.089
- Yo, Vinnie!
- What?

51:26.160 --> 51:27.810
- Where is the Base Hospital?
- Hospital?

51:27.880 --> 51:29.848
- Hospital?
- You take care of my shit.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.730
I'm gonna go out here
and check out this new turf.

51:32.960 --> 51:35.122
Oh, look at this, more stuff.

51:35.400 --> 51:37.289
Now what am I, a closet?

51:37.960 --> 51:40.201
Oh, don't do anything.
Just stand there, Alvin.

51:40.280 --> 51:41.441
That's right.

51:41.520 --> 51:43.761
Okay, you're ready to go out there
and show them what's what?

51:43.840 --> 51:45.604
- Alight!
- I thought you're gonna sleep though.

51:45.680 --> 51:48.411
I can't sleep, you know. I've been
sitting so long I get all cramped up.

51:48.480 --> 51:51.051
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

51:51.120 --> 51:53.885
All right, let's go. Let's have action.

51:58.160 --> 52:00.447
You should have joined the Army,
Bisbee.

52:00.520 --> 52:02.329
I didn't join, sir.

52:05.080 --> 52:08.323
I told you already, I can't refill
that prescription. It's a narcotic.

52:08.400 --> 52:11.006
Come on, it's just some little pills
they gave me back in boot camp.

52:11.080 --> 52:13.924
Look, Private, I'm off duty.
Sick call's in the morning.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.082
Hey, you got to give me something.

52:16.160 --> 52:18.731
Wait a minute, goddamn it.

52:25.960 --> 52:30.522
Come here, man. I'm not gonna talk to
you out on the street. Come on.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.323
I want you to do
some of this stuff, man.

52:34.400 --> 52:36.687
I mean, this is gonna
set you right partner, no lie.

52:36.840 --> 52:40.208
Oh, man, are you crazy? I ain't gonna
shoot none of that shit in my veins.

52:40.320 --> 52:43.927
Oh, I don't blame you, man.
I mean, I hate needles myself.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.331
You just...

52:45.440 --> 52:49.240
Now, I don't do drugs.
I don't want to get hooked on dope.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.685
I just... I've been taking
some little pills that's all.

52:52.760 --> 52:55.650
They gave them to me in boot camp
for pain. Demerol.

52:55.720 --> 52:56.960
Demerol?

52:57.200 --> 52:59.248
And what you think Demerol is?
Some guy in a lab...

52:59.360 --> 53:02.443
he cooks this stuff up into little pills,
he sticks it in a bottle...

53:02.520 --> 53:05.649
- it's the same as this.
- Yeah, like hell it is.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.321
Well, there's just one way
to find out, huh, sport?

53:08.400 --> 53:12.450
I need enough to circulate
in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles.

53:12.520 --> 53:14.761
Everybody's out, everything is dry.

53:14.840 --> 53:17.366
I'm here to represent
all the dryness there.

53:17.440 --> 53:20.125
I need to meet the big man, here.
Beaucoup.

53:20.200 --> 53:22.965
I'm taking about the big money,
dollars...

53:24.320 --> 53:27.449
Motherfucker, do you
understand English?

53:27.560 --> 53:29.688
Don't poke sticks!

53:30.080 --> 53:32.401
OK, huh?!

53:39.840 --> 53:43.128
Guns are different.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.564
I am Col. Long Dong...

53:52.640 --> 53:56.326
district chief and commandant
of the National Police Field Force.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.721
- I suspect you know why you're here.
- Look, man.

53:58.800 --> 54:01.246
I only went into that dump
to have myself a drink.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.561
I took the wrong turn
when I was looking for...

54:03.640 --> 54:07.406
Corporal, you're conspiring
to traffic heroin, don't deny it.

54:07.480 --> 54:09.767
I wonder of you were aware
of the Vietcong bringing heroin...

54:09.840 --> 54:12.844
down the Ho Chi Minh Trail and
that the profits support guerilla forces!

54:12.920 --> 54:14.126
- I had no idea...
- Doesn't it bother you...

54:14.200 --> 54:16.487
to harm your own troops?
Does it bother you...

54:16.560 --> 54:18.881
to put money in the pockets
of your enemies?

54:21.480 --> 54:22.766
No?

54:26.360 --> 54:27.441
Good.

54:28.600 --> 54:30.045
Doesn't bother me either.

54:31.240 --> 54:34.687
Men of conscience have
no place in our business.

54:34.840 --> 54:38.208
I understand you'll be stationed
in I Corps.

54:38.560 --> 54:41.882
My brother-in-law, Col. Trang,
is District Chief there.

54:41.960 --> 54:44.406
If we are to do business,
he will visit you.

54:44.480 --> 54:45.447
What's the big "if"?

54:45.760 --> 54:48.730
You understand that everything
you ship back to your country...

54:48.800 --> 54:52.486
- is searched thoroughly?
- There's one thing that isn't.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.764
What is that?

54:54.920 --> 54:55.967
The body bags.

54:56.280 --> 54:57.520
Oh...

54:57.760 --> 54:59.364
Oh, Alvin...

54:59.480 --> 55:01.289
Look at the tits on number 40.

55:04.040 --> 55:05.451
Give her a 10.

55:05.520 --> 55:07.568
All right, a 10?

55:08.600 --> 55:11.080
- Nine and three quarters.
- Nine and three quarters.

55:11.200 --> 55:14.522
While you're at it, write something down
and we'll get you the hell out of here.

55:14.600 --> 55:16.648
I don't want to get out of here, Dave.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.489
Al, it's true.

55:22.120 --> 55:25.010
Half of your fucking problem
is no fucking!

55:25.120 --> 55:26.087
Come on!

55:26.160 --> 55:28.208
Hey, listen now, once you find out
that your pecker is good...

55:28.280 --> 55:31.170
for more than goosing with, you won't
be so quick to want to get it shot off.

55:31.240 --> 55:32.401
Yeah, yeah, all right, all right.

55:33.360 --> 55:35.761
♫ Happy birthday to you... ♫

55:36.040 --> 55:38.520
♫ Happy birthday to you... ♫

55:43.920 --> 55:46.969
♫ Happy birthday, General Dearborn,
Happy birthday, fuck you. ♫

55:47.760 --> 55:49.364
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

55:50.600 --> 55:53.410
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

55:53.480 --> 55:56.290
I got some money for everybody.
Hang on, baby.

55:56.920 --> 55:58.445
There you go.

56:04.760 --> 56:07.525
Sound off!
1-2...

56:12.360 --> 56:14.089
Al, look at this!

56:14.360 --> 56:16.681
Hey! It's Mickey Mouse Mantle
over here.

56:16.760 --> 56:18.603
Doesn't look like
he can handle his stuff, huh?

56:18.680 --> 56:23.720
- What he needs is a little more of this.
- You get that bottle out of his face!

56:25.240 --> 56:28.562
Oh, my god, this boy is OD-ing
on some heavy shit.

56:28.640 --> 56:31.405
If we don't get him up right now,
he'll be cold in half an hour.

56:31.480 --> 56:33.801
All right, everybody up.
Hold on to this, Alvin.

56:34.160 --> 56:36.527
Hold on. Here we go.
Everybody up!

56:37.880 --> 56:40.690
What's this guy bringing,
potatoes in a bag?

56:40.840 --> 56:43.571
Stop fucking up. If you're not
gonna help, get out of the way!

56:43.640 --> 56:45.483
This guy's dying, goddamn it.

56:47.840 --> 56:50.320
it's over. You get down.

56:51.880 --> 56:53.041
Sandbag!

56:53.120 --> 56:56.408
The enemy blew up the General's trailer!
We'll go through over the wire!

56:56.480 --> 56:58.209
- There's VC all over the place!
- Pike!

56:58.280 --> 56:59.884
Wake up!

57:00.960 --> 57:02.291
What?!

57:02.360 --> 57:04.761
The enemy blew up
the General's trailer.

57:05.120 --> 57:08.090
All the world is exploding.
Jesus Christ!

57:10.080 --> 57:12.731
♫ Happy Birthday,
General Dearborn... ♫

57:13.320 --> 57:15.163
Jesus h. christ!

57:16.400 --> 57:18.721
Hey, Al!
Pike is sleeping like a log.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.480
Bisbee, get down,
you stupid motherfucker.

57:21.560 --> 57:23.642
Get over here and sit down.
Sit down!

57:24.400 --> 57:25.561
Pike!

57:25.640 --> 57:26.801
Oh, god...

57:27.160 --> 57:29.891
Damn it! The VC are fucking having an
attack on us, and you're out there...

57:29.960 --> 57:32.042
- playing your music.
- They're not VC.

57:32.120 --> 57:34.646
I put a Claymore
under the General's trailer.

57:37.080 --> 57:38.809
You put one more round
into the god damn mortar...

57:38.880 --> 57:41.167
I'm gonna blow up
whatever brains you got left!

57:41.240 --> 57:43.163
- There's 10,000...
- Asshole!

57:43.240 --> 57:45.641
You and your freaks are the only ones
shooting anything around here.

57:46.160 --> 57:48.208
Come here. Come here.

57:48.720 --> 57:49.846
Come here!

57:51.800 --> 57:55.486
Oh, man... I can't keep you
alive by myself.

57:55.560 --> 57:58.609
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?

57:58.880 --> 58:01.929
I cannot keep you alive by myself!

58:02.040 --> 58:04.520
You're gotta wanna live.
Come on, man.

58:04.600 --> 58:05.726
I can't feel my legs.

58:05.800 --> 58:08.565
What do you mean you can't feel
your legs? You're dying, man.

58:08.640 --> 58:11.371
You're fucking dead meat, man.
You're fucking dying!

58:11.560 --> 58:14.166
You understand me?
Look at your eyes.

58:14.240 --> 58:17.289
Your eyes are like
two fucking pin holes in the snow.

58:17.560 --> 58:21.281
Come on, Pike. Come on.

58:21.360 --> 58:24.967
Come on, Pike. Come on.
Come out of it.

58:25.200 --> 58:27.487
Come on, Pike.
You gotta help me, man.

58:27.560 --> 58:29.130
You gotta want to live.

58:29.240 --> 58:31.971
You son of a bitch,
you ain't gonna die on me!

58:32.040 --> 58:34.008
You gotta wanna live,
goddamn it!

58:35.320 --> 58:38.005
January 12, 1968.

58:38.080 --> 58:40.321
We're on our way to the Division
Headquarters at Da Nang.

58:40.800 --> 58:43.485
The Captain can't prove that Dave
blew up the General's trailer.

58:44.240 --> 58:47.528
I just hope he hasn't noticed that
one of our Claymore mines is missing.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.648
Billy seems to be fine now.

58:49.800 --> 58:52.644
But Tyrone is still really pissed off
at him. I can't see why.

58:52.720 --> 58:55.326
I mean, it wasn't Billy's fault
he got all messed up.

58:55.400 --> 58:58.961
I sort of wonder what's really bugging
Tyrone. I know whet's bugging Vinnie.

58:59.440 --> 59:01.727
He picked up a dose of clap
from those hookers.

59:01.800 --> 59:04.280
And now he thinks I must have
it even worse than he does...

59:04.360 --> 59:07.045
because I had three of those girls
come up to my room.

59:07.120 --> 59:09.202
The only thing I did
was talk to them.

59:09.280 --> 59:11.760
And I got some great stories
for my journal.

59:11.840 --> 59:13.205
Of course,
how could I tell Vinnie that?

59:13.280 --> 59:14.805
Look! Al!

59:14.960 --> 59:18.009
Al, that's triage.
That's a hospital, Al.

59:18.120 --> 59:19.804
- So what?
- So what?

59:19.880 --> 59:23.726
So we gotta go see a doctor, Al, before
our peckers run off and crawl way.

59:23.880 --> 59:26.804
Look, I'm dripping like a Good Humor
in July, you know what I mean?

59:26.920 --> 59:29.048
What are you talking about?
I feel fine.

59:29.160 --> 59:31.527
You feel fine? Hey, if I got the clap
from one of them...

59:31.640 --> 59:33.563
you got it at least three times
as bad, right?

59:33.680 --> 59:35.887
Now, listen, Archie went that way.
We go this way.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.002
Keep your mouth shut. Come on.

59:38.120 --> 59:41.442
Pike, look at that. That's The Dragons.
They're the soccer champs of I Corps.

59:41.560 --> 59:42.971
Flashy devils, ain't they?

59:43.080 --> 59:45.048
How'd you like
to beat the shit out of them?

59:45.160 --> 59:47.811
You think what that would do
for morale.

59:49.960 --> 59:52.440
All right, people set it down in here.
Take five.

59:52.560 --> 59:54.881
Okay, Jarines listen up here.

59:55.320 --> 59:57.561
It is your job to make sure...

59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.604
that when a coffin contains
a body bag...

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.564
marked "remains non-viewable"...

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.926
that no one...

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.241
especially the next of kin...

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:11.484
will open that body bag
under any circumstances.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.405
Okay, load them up.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.723
But make sure that the coffins
are loaded with the head down...

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.684
otherwise embalming fluid
will collect in the feet...

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.963
and the body will begin
to decompose.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.929
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.761
January 14, 1968.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.885
We've been assigned to the combat
base at Con Thien...

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.810
up near the DMZ.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.281
We 're what they call
a Replacement Company.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.050
All the guys are trying
not to think about...

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.600
what happened to the company
we 're replacing.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.000
I'm not worried about that.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.488
I just hope we get there
in one piece.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.524
This is supposed to be
a pacified area...

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:49.964
but after what happened in the last
convoy, the guys are all pretty jumpy.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.681
They see Vietcong
behind every rice pile.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.246
And Vinnie almost shot
a water buffalo.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:02.290
Captain Collins has been so busy
looking out for another ambush...

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.846
he's gotten us lost
three times already.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.248
Bisbee, get on the horn and find out
what the hell he's stopping for!

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.201
- Yeah, I think you're right there.
- There! Over there!

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.682
Wait a minute!
Goddamit!

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.970
Who gave the order to shoot?

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.050
Get a hold of Archer. Get Archer.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.564
- What's everybody shooting at?
- What the hell are you pointing at?

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.041
I was pointing at the road
to Con Diem!

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.081
Oh, shit.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.800
Gentleman, welcome to Con Diem.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.970
Your company commander tells me...

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.281
you've already had some
seasoning under fire.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:55.207
Here, at the first battalion will take
a lot of pride in a high body count.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.288
Now the company you're replacing
had the highest kill ratio...

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.731
in the whole damn division.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.010
And I'd be mighty proud of any unit that
fought and died half as courageously...

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.242
as they did.
Now to back you up...

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:12.565
we got fire support on hill 609,
614, and right here.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.768
And we can hit any damn spot
in the valley.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.286
Charlie can, too!

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.001
Captain, get your people
on the Northeast perimeter.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.687
I wanna see all officers, staff, NCOS
in the command bunker now. Move it!

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.331
Let's go! Let's move!
Go! Go! Go!

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.010
Move! Let's go!

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.286
Move! Move!

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.325
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:55.166
Squad leader! First squad to the tree
at the first bunker!

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.960
Second squad to the first part
of the second bunker!

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.724
- Fire power!
- Lieutenant!

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.810
God damn it! The Colonel wants
your ass in the CT now!

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.166
On the double!

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.322
- Get somebody to watch that position.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.768
Hold your fire! Stop shooting!
Those are our own troops!

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.646
Shit, the VC's got them
pinned down!

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.685
Get the lieutenant. Tell him they got
pinned down by enemy sniper!

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.326
Oh my god! They're being shelled
by our own artillery!

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.880
Tell them, man, they're being shot at
by our own artillery!

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.201
- Our own artillery is...
- What the hell he's saying?

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.731
Says it's out of his hands.
The Colonel's in charged of this.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.040
What do you mean,
it's out of his hands?

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.043
The colonel can't fucking see
what's happening man!

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.010
What the he'll are they doing
in that god damn hole!

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.445
God damn it!

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.045
You can't stop this!

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.443
Lieutenant...

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.643
Get the hell out of here! Not a goddamn
thing you can do in here right now!

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.882
Lieutenant, but you don't know
they're blowing away our own men.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.042
The Colonel knows what he's doing,
goddamit!

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.168
They're walking the artillery back to
the tree line so that they can...

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.562
- zap the snipers and free our patrol.
- But he's walking it right over our men!

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.961
And you know that, man, you could
see that if you weren't hiding...

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.690
down in this god damn hole!

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.570
Man, you gave us all the jive
about playing Charlie's games...

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.768
by Charlie's rules, and you're
fucking down here...

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.683
staying in this place
from the god damn bench...

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.167
...like Charlie's standing still
waiting for the ball to be snapped.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.527
- Back it up, man!
- Go ahead, kill me, man!

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.931
Harry!

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.810
Keep your goddamned mouth shut,
Washington, just for a goddamn minute?

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.564
Captain... Captain...

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.529
Call off the artillery.
Give me a few men...

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.204
I'll go up and get those gooks
out of that tree line.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.251
Lieutenant, the colonel has decided he'd
rather commit firepower than risk manpower.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.242
Just shut up!

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:42.166
And you get your black ass beck on that
line before I court martial you both.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.730
Jesus Christ!

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:48.406
These assholes are not gonna help us.
Now go ahead now. Go ahead!

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.524
Hey, Red, I need this man.
I owe you a favor.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.841
Later.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.047
I need this shit, man.
I will give it back to you later.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.362
Come on, Pike!
Here, Fazio.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.171
Bisbee! Get you're ass over here
and follow me, on the double!

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.690
Keep low!

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:26.968
OK. Everybody stay down
and stay quiet.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.963
Don't you fire
until I give you the signal.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.882
Pike? Don't fuck this one up.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.361
Now!

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.766
Yeah! I did it!
And I hope I got your mama!

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.161
Hey...

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.368
I wonder if any of our guys
are still alive.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.486
OK, Washington, I just got my ass
chewed up by the old man.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.404
We're going out on patrol tomorrow.
Your ass is going to be on the point...

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.960
right in front, And I'm going to
guarantee you some action.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.566
Because thanks to you, I had to promise
the Colonel a bigger body count...

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.769
- than the company we replaced.
- Yeah? I got you a head start already.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.764
And that is the only thing
keeping your big mouth out of the brig.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:26.131
Do you mind if I get this men some help
before he bleeds to death... Sir?

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.326
Corpsman,
Can we get some help please?

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.965
Watch his face.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.883
- You people okay?
- Yeah.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.088
You got that patrol on time.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.209
Next time don't waste time
going to captain first, right?

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:44.330
Next time I'll make sure
I'll get the captain out of my way first.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.522
Well, you did good.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.811
Pike! Are you fucking
with pills again?!

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.163
Hey... hey... hold up!!!

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.210
Lieutenant, it's okay.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.810
Fucking told your ass I don't want
no junkie on my back. Didn't I?

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:07.327
Yeah, well the captain gave me these.
Goddamit, 'cause my fucking foot hurts.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:11.166
And he also said I don't have to be
in your shitty squad anymore.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.687
- it's okay.
- I know it's okay.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.201
I'm cool.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.290
Stay away from me!

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:22.251
You stay the fuck away from me, man.
If I ever catch you near me again...

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:25.369
I'm going to put my foot
upside your ass... sideways.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:28.006
Line of departure,
lock em' and load em'.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.724
Now keep those canteens full.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:33.009
I don't want half empty sloshing around.
VC will hear, there'll be an ambush.

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.162
Yeah, you can see this line
a mile away.

01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.481
Get to the point Washington,
right at the point.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:40.211
I'm sorry, Sergeant.
What am I, Charles Atlas?

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.521
- Stop it, Fazio.
- Get up front, move.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.968
Lieutenant, keep them off the roads,
they're fully mined.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.321
Captain, I'm gonna take it a little easier
today. Half my people still have the shits.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.561
All right.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.600
- Pike.
- Yes, Sir?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.240
Get the hell with that...

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:55.005
- How's that kicking foot?
- Better. Thanks for set-up.

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.367
All right, you step right next to me.

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:02.651
Well, today is the start
of a new body count month.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.411
I don't have to remind you...

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.327
that the company, that leads...

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.925
the highest body count...

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:16.323
will get three days of R&R
at China Beach.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.644
- Hey, Vin, you know I'm just thinking?
- Yeah.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.642
How tough it is to hump this stuff
in this muddy swamp here.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:32.169
No, this isn't a swamp,
These are rice fields.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:35.488
This is an engineering marvel,
thousands of years old.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.484
They terrace the land,
so that the water flows evenly...

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.769
from one paddy, to the next,
to the next, to the next.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.684
Like this whole valley
was one giant fountain.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.247
Hell, I hate rice.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.644
I don't even eat Rice Krispies.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.287
You've got a heavy load right there,
take it easy.

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:57.131
I wish I didn't have this M-16
to tow around.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.691
The gun doesn't weigh anything, Bisbee.
The radio weighs about 40 pounds.

01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:06.250
- You won't kill anybody with a radio.
- Say what?

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:09.365
Can't kill anybody with a radio, sir.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.929
Damn it, Pike, put that letter away.
It's ankle breaking territory.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.049
Yes, sir. See, I read the damn thing
20 times anyway.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.640
Don't worry, she'll wait for you.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.167
It ain't that.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.211
She says some damn freshman broke
one of my high school track records.

01:09:26.279 --> 01:09:27.884
I ain't afraid of getting killed today

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.606
so much as what's going
to happen after, I mean.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.848
Ain't nothing except a couple
of damn trophies at school...

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.725
and then next year, somebody hit more
homeruns than you did and then they...

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:41.327
change the damn names on the trophy.
There ain't nothing left at all.

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:43.801
Don't you worry, we'll get you into
a soccer game with the Dragons...

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.770
and get a whole shitload of new
records. Yep.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.641
Did anybody hear a click?

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:59.083
No, no. That's just me.
I'm just taking some pictures.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.881
Oh. You idiot. Will you put that camera
away and watch out for trip wire?

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.166
Sorry.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.646
Al, I'm dying of thirst over here,
I'm parched. I can't believe...

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.451
we can't take a drink because of this
no sloshing canteens ruling.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.767
No sloshing... we sound like
a bunch of plumbers out here.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.241
Foster...

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.923
- Did you just take a picture?
- No.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.520
Everybody stop!
Be still.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.083
Everybody just be cool.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.521
What're you doing?

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.524
I'm taking a bath really.

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.530
Oh, come on, I'm serious!
What're you doing?!

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.568
- I'm on a mine.
- What?

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.560
What do I do?

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.927
The fuck you mean, what?
Get the hell out of the way!

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.800
All right, it's a mine!
Everybody retrace your steps!

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.561
Retrace you steps!
Back! Back!

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.928
Damn it, don't go near that man.
Leave him alone, he is a dead man!

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.525
Back it up! Back it up!

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.690
Damn it! That's an order!

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.969
Do not move, Washington.
It's a pressure release device.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.408
It will not detonate
unless you take your weight off it.

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.050
Like I'm going somewhere.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.802
- Do not move! Do not breathe!
- Move, Lieutenant. That is an order!

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.765
Get those ammo cases.
Get those ammo boxes.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.046
Right now!

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.441
Goddamit, Pike!
I will not lose another life!

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.045
Now, come on back here!

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.566
Pressure release device. Gotta
replace Washington's weight...

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.768
with the weight of ammo boxes.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.526
Find the plate, seek out the plate.
Find it first.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.330
Very carefully.
Do not move Washington.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.004
Do not move at all.

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.930
Very carefully Pike, That's it!

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.286
Very carefully.

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:43.966
Will you get the fuck away from me,
Pike? I'll kick you in your ass.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.202
Shut up, you big lummox.
If you do any kicking...

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.163
you'd better do it with your
god damn right foot.

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.361
Let him work, Washington!

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.122
You find it?
You find it, Pike?

01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.086
All right. Take that first box, and
you put it on the edge of the panel.

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.322
Very carefully, very softly.
As he does so, Washington...

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.803
you move your foot, slowly removing
the amount of weight he's replacing.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.283
All right, here comes the first one.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.486
Easy.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.086
Ease off.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:33.411
- Man, will you just get out of my life!
- Just shut up, you make me nervous.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.801
You both better shut up
if you wanna live!

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.449
Put that second box down there,
Pike.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.408
I may not get a chance
to tell you this...

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.051
but you're the biggest goddamn bastard
I have known in my life.

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.361
Yeah? But your mama like it,
you motherfucker!

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:01.122
All right, now, very slowly,
on the count of three...

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.965
remove your foot and run like hell.
Do you understand me, Washington?

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:04.802
OK, let's go.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:07.209
One, two, three...

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.406
Let's go!

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.243
We are going on the road. This whole
area and all these paddies are mined!

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.489
Dipshit!

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.771
Well, I ain't gonna kiss
your skinny lips, quaker.

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.450
Yeah, we're even.

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.883
So fuck off.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.286
Can you imagine being
on one of those mines?

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.603
- Go nuts in five seconds.
- What are sweating about, Al?

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.001
Fazio would have you
off there like that.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.851
- Hey, you'd risk your life for me?
- Of course, I would.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.684
- Would you do the same for me?
- Yeah.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.250
Well, we're buddies.

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.091
Washington?

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.129
Slow down, Washington, we're not
running any race around here.

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.369
Lieutenant, did you see
the Captain's face?

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:03.287
- See his face when?
- When I was standing on that mine.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.728
What are you talking about,
Washington?

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:10.649
Was the son of a bitch smiling?

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.005
Son of a bitch is running.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.369
You want these back, stay out of trouble
and start taking care of yourself.

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:24.886
- Sir, it's the Colonel again.
- You're worth shit to me!

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.800
It's Collins here, sir.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.325
Lieutenant!

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.684
All right, I want two scouting details.
Check out the left hand side...

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.649
and the right hand side
of the river next to the bridge.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.290
Lieutenant, what the hell
is going on now?

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.601
I'm sending some people to checkout
the river, find us a place to cross.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:38.727
We haven't got any time.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.928
That minefield caused a delay
in our operations timetable...

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.368
now the Colonel is on my ass to
hump into ambush position by sunset...

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.444
- so we can get some body counts.
- I understand that, sir.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.648
There's a risk factor involving
crossing the goddamn bridge.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.530
Don't you see it's a toss up anyway
we play it. Intelligence tells us...

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.210
the road is mined, to stick with
the paddies.

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.328
The paddies are mined, we're back
on the road. And you want me...

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.051
- to send men back into the bush again.
- Yes, I do, sir. It's my opinion...

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.441
Well, you forget your opinion,
because I'm in charge here...

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.808
and it is my opinion that
the risk factor is minimal.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:08.601
I'll stake my bars on it.
I'll cross that goddamn bridge myself.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.611
Freeze!
You stay where you are.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:13.524
At least let me get the people
to clear the bridge for you!

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.643
Goddamn that son of a...

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.849
Give me two 60s on either flank
right now and four riflemen with them.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.967
Foster, Washington...

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.724
C'mon, move out!

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.370
Harry, get up here.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.402
Go!

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:29.245
Let's go, Lieutenant!

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.845
Bring them over.
Bring them over.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:34.846
Two at a time. Keep your interval,
do not bunch up on that bridge.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.131
Jesus, don't take all night.
Get them moving!

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.930
- Let's go.
- Two at a time.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.329
Let's go!
Let's go!

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.971
Goddamit, it's taking all night.
Move them over.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.162
All of them at a time.
Let's go!

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.484
- Everybody, move it. Move it out.
- Hey, we gotta send them two at a time!

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.126
You heard him!

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.924
That son of a goddamn bitch.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.847
- The M79!
- Yes, Sir! It's right here.

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.290
Give it to me right now!

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.485
- Over there!
- Yes, yes.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.642
Pike!

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.290
Move your ass out of there.
Go on!

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.723
Move your ass out of there!

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.610
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.402
- Get that.
- Niner.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.287
Let's see what we got, Washington.
Let's move!

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.927
Hold fire! Hold fire!

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.600
Hold fire!

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.247
Lieutenant!

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:54.529
I want you to give me a body count
on the double! Let's go, go, go!

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:58.321
All right. My IDO has been hit.
Get battalion on the line.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.647
Pike, how are you doing?
Are you all right?

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.845
Hurry it up, Lieutenant!

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.446
Goddamit. I could
kick the shit out of him.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.804
All right, here you are.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.281
All right, Colonel, we've engaged
the enemy on the bridge and we're...

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.125
expecting a big body count.
If you just hold it a minute, Sir.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.366
What's going on? Come on!

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.523
- I need that body count, goddamit!
- It's a tunnel!

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:24.411
Colonel, we'll delay on that body count,
we've got a tunnel.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.051
We're gonna have to track it down
and I'll be right back to you...

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.845
as soon as we find the source.
I got a good idea where they're going.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.649
Yes, sir.
Yes.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.601
Shit!

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.967
- Where do you think they're going?
- I've got a goddamn...

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.361
good idea where.
Right over there...

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.808
we got us a VC village and we're gonna
light it up like the fourth of July.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.042
You get me artillery,
I'll feed you some coordinates.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.804
Sir, there are probably
a couple hundred people in there...

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.770
Jesus Christ! That is an enemy village.
Will you get me artillery?!

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.763
Where the hell am I?
3... 3-3-6.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.525
- Sorry, sir, I can't do that.
- 4-7-2. What can't you do?

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.729
- 3-3-5.
- I'm not gonna do it with a rifle...

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.484
and I'm not gonna do it
with the radio, sir.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:01.643
- What wouldn't you do?
- Murder another human being, sir.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.722
Bisbee, you get me that artillery...

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.929
or your ass is in the brig
in Da Nang and that is a direct order.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.924
Sir, I must respectfully
refuse to obey that order.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.480
Goddamit, you're in big trouble!

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.768
War Eagle,
this is Charlie One, over.

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.082
War Eagle,
this is Charlie One, over.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.362
War Eagle, I got
a firing mission for you.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.684
Request 105 assistance.
Coordinates are 3-3-5, 4-7-2.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.609
The target is an enemy village.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.802
I want this man placed
under field arrest.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:32.967
What happened now?

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.290
He refused to obey my direct order
to call artillery on an enemy position.

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.851
I had to do it myself,
the son of a bitch.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.200
What enemy position, Captain?

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.806
Goddamit, that village,
that is a VC village!

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.844
- What in the fuck are you talking about?
- That is where the tunnels come out.

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.247
It's right where
the tunnels come out.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.803
Bisbee, get on the horn, call artillery
and tell them to disregard that order.

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.729
Now, just wait a fucking minute.
You're in trouble!

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.888
Goddamit, you're going
out of your mind, man!

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.647
- You're going out of your mind!
- I don't need to take that shit from you!

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.842
- We don't need to take that village!
- We got to take that reaper out??

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.122
I want a body count, goddamit!

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.767
Holy shit...

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.684
Washington, would you mind
getting your ass on the point?

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.406
Lieutenant, I want you to keep
a running body count.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.689
All right, keep alert, I want you to
all be watching for a tunnel opening.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.290
Keep watching all over!

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.161
That tunnel's around here somewhere.
The man who finds it...

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:53.171
gets an in-country R&R,
three days at China Beach.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.931
Goddamit, will you put that down?
Everything could be boobied.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.646
Put it down!
Come on, back in the line.

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:05.767
Lieutenant, you get a count yet?

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.525
Yes, sir, two chickens and a duck.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.923
All right, Gunny, let's break
the men into details.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.611
We'll search and clear all the hooches,
the rice piles, everything.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.165
Let's see what we can uncover.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.251
- You got anything, Lieutenant?
- The village is deserted, sir.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.443
The hell it is. You just
don't know where to look yet.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:25.326
- What do you got up there?
- It's snakes, sir.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:26.566
Shit.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.365
- Captain?
- Yeah.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.128
We got some bodies here, sir.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.970
He's got his goddamn bodies.

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.129
Here's your body count, Captain.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.329
But I guess it doesn't really count.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.242
All these people are alive.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:46.762
Hey, Skipper,
look what I found out here.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.365
All right, you little gook.

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.681
I wanna know where that tunnel is and
wanna know where your friends are...

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.644
'cause you did not blow
the shit out of us by yourself.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.848
- He can't understand a goddamn thing.
- He can talk English...

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.445
as good as you or me.
Let me work on him.

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.722
Harry, get on the radio
and get someone from S2.

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:07.531
I wanna interrogate a prisoner on the
double. Get out there, go on.

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.324
Jesus Christ.

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.569
All right, did he have a weapon?

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:13.960
It's just this club.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.041
Captain.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.964
Forget it. If this man had been digging
a tunnel before coming here...

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.247
...his hands wouldn't be as clean as
they are, but dirtier than mine.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.322
Shit, we took so long to get here
and he could have a shower.

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.607
Captain, this ain't a weapon,
it looks like a baseball bat.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.523
They know from baseball like
I know from polo.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.921
Who do you think won
the Little League World series?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.809
Damn chinks from Taiwan.

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.167
Hey buddy, do you play baseball?

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.805
- Grenade!!
- Grenade!

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.564
Hey, let me see this.

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.642
Hey, you play baseball!

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.882
Come on, buddy.
Come on, little buddy, let's go.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.440
Here's the bat.
All right, buddy.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:45.442
All right. Let's go.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:55.440
Come on! You're pitching
like your granny, Fazio.

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.851
Hit that ball!

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.171
Colonel Trang.

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.966
He's out!
He's out!

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:07.328
He's out! Out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:09.927
It's over!

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.927
All right, men, this is Colonel Trang
from the National Police Field Force.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.368
And this is Major Royal, Special
Forces adviser. They are here...

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.602
- to take care of the interrogation.
- What interrogation?

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:22.170
Hell, he ain't no VC!

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.561
He's just a kid who plays baseball
better than most.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.688
Don't worry!
Don't worry!

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.046
Shut it up!

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.605
Don't worry.

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.649
Nothing will happen to him.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:34.769
If he is no VC, no worry.

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:38.561
-I'm telling you he's not the enemy.
.-That's right, I'm with him.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:42.605
Relax!

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:46.251
Look, these are
Colonel Trang's people.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.609
He understands how to deal with them.
We just take the kid, check his story out.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.006
That's strictly routine.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:55.004
That good enough for you, Pike?
You got the Major's word as an officer.

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.811
- Absolutely.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.809
All right, we're gonna move it out.
Gunny, get them going.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.724
Washington, you're on the point.
Let's get moving! Out! Let's go!

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:06.164
Goddamn body count. We'll have
to be out here again tomorrow.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.844
Let's fill those ranks in.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.089
Hey, wait a minute.
What was that?

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.122
Let's move.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.646
I heard something, dammit.
Hootie, shut that radio off.

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.046
Pike...

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:21.369
Would you get your ass back
into the column. Come on.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.241
- I'm going back.
- You just wait a minute!

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.127
Now, wait a minute.
Listen to me.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:33.602
I want you to take these back
and we'll forget about this morning.

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.648
Come on, take them,
because I've got big plans for you.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.165
Now, don't you blow it.
Come on!

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:40.367
- I ain't playing soccer for you.
- Yeah?

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:43.330
Well, you do that and you're gonna
let down the whole goddamn team!

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.722
You think what that could do for morale
if we beat the dragons. Don't blow it!

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.642
Take these.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.563
I wouldn't play for you
if my life depended on it.

01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:51.688
Well, it does.
You need me, Pike.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.526
A junkie needs all the help he can get.
Now, you do exactly what I tell you...

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.729
or else you're a dead man. Now stuff
some of these down your throat. Go on!

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.565
You're the one who's dead,
goddamit!

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.646
You wouldn't have done that
if that was a white boy back there.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:19.281
Yeah, but to you he's just nothing but
a gook. He's just a yellow nigger.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.091
- He is the enemy.
- No, you're the enemy!

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.483
Well, he finally did it, didn't he, Al?

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.403
That son of a bitch
finally got a body count.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.728
And you're an asshole.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.007
If you're gonna be dumb enough
to pull a gun on a man...

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.289
you better be smart enough
to pull the trigger.

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.283

Gonna be joining the combined
action platoon, Tam Bak Hamlet.

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.444
You're gonna be guarding the rice.

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:22.841
Get your stuff, get on the jeep,
you move it out right now.

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.570
Thank you, Captain.

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.771
They're taking them away.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.810
You got anymore of this pound cake
in your C rations there? I'm almost out.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.565
Didn't you hear me? They're taking
Pike and Bisbee away in a jeep.

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.967
Yeah, I heard you, Alvin.
Now, did you hear me?

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.044
I want more pound cake
in your C rations there.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:45.648
Hey, you think they'll drive them
all the way to Da Nang in a jeep?

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.605
I don't know.

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.725
I'll tell you one thing I do know though.
Old Fazio over here is gonna...

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.327
get himself a jug and drink his money
down before gun gets his mitts into it.

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.801
That's what I'm talking about.
You coming?

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.200
No.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.410
I wanna write down everything
that happened today.

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.331
But who the fuck would believe it?

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.566
Well...

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.120
I told the Colonel not
to send them to the brig.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:26.329
Wouldn't mind if we got
a discipline problem around here.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.446
The old Captain jumps in
and sends them to guard the rice...

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.443
in Tam Bak Hamlet.

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.324
Well...

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.241
At least that's better
than going to the brig.

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:45.844
Do you happen to notice those guys in
the bags over there they were placing?

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.967
Charlie mines the paddy every night.

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.323
And every morning someone else
gets blown to shit.

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:55.930
They're lucky if they last a week.

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.845
Hey, buddy.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.610
Moon juice. Check it out.

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:03.287
- They've got a still over there.
- I see you found your jug.

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.725
That ain't all I found.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.923
You know those guys in Delta company
got down in their hooch?

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.445
- A hooker.
- You're kidding!

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:13.127
I swear to god. She's 15 and she's
a knockout and I may be in love.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.282
Hey, Superman,
let's you and me get laid, huh?

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.408
Why don't you go?
I'm sort of busy.

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:21.208
You can't let a chance like this pass you
by. You owe it to Pike and Bisbee.

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:23.726
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean, "What do I mean?"

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.529
Remember what I told you.
It ain't like you got forever.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.762
- You grab it as it goes by, Al.
- Nah, nah, nah.

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:30.491
I don't feel like
grabbing anything today.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:40.408
- What is that shit you got on?
- Oh, thinking about recipes for C rations.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.443
You know, like cooking.
Stuff like that.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.363
- Cooking?
- Yeah.

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:49.051
Hey...

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:53.523
- You got checked up by the doc yet?
- No, I told you I feel fine.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:57.162
Hey, I'm pissing razor blades over here
and I just biffed one of them.

01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.050
You fucked three of them,
you feel fine?

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.966
Boy... you must be the wonder
of the medical world, Al.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.847
Either that or maybe you
didn't even touch them, huh?

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:10.327
- Swapping recipes with them in there?
- No!

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:13.290
- Hey, Vinnie, I never said anything...
- I don't think you fucked any of them.

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.601
I don't think girls turn you on.
Hey!

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.445
I think you might be a little
hotel-motel, right?

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.285
What are you talking about?
I thought you were my friend.

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:25.968
I don't care what you thought.
I ain't that kind of friend, you know?

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.206
Just stay the fuck away from me,
Foster. And I mean it.

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:33.011
Yes, sir, Captain.
I think I see the enemy out there.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.684
Yes, sir. OP4.

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.684
Be right down?
Thank you, sir.

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.244
VC! Down right there!

01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.721
Here comes the enemy.
Come on.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.723
Come on, Captain,
you motherfucker.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.122
Clear the boxes. Come on.
A little bit more. Yeah!

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.361
You think that's gonna get
Pike and Bisbee back?

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:12.482
I'm gonna get that motherfucker. I'm
gonna kill that sadistic son of a bitch.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.846
You probably would.

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:16.686
But I'm not gonna watch it.
Because it's bullshit.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:20.003
Bullshit! Like everything else that's
going on around this goddamn place.

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.890
Radio Hanoi.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.527
And just a reminder that the weather
is sweet at this time of year.

01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:29.166
It's really cool, boy.

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.843
Your two minions say you
wanna see me.

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.647
Well, you see me.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.690
I'm sorry I did not see you
at the village.

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:57.446
When your company was there today.

01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.724
But you see...

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.051
I was indisposed.

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:07.165
I'm Colonel Trang, district chief.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:11.283
My brother-in-law has told me
of your proposition.

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.363
Fascinating...

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:18.371
this little tag mark...

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:21.326
"remains non-viewable".

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:28.322
It will help us to keep prying eyes
from intervening with our business.

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:34.007
So as soon as your contact deposits
the capital, we can begin.

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:40.128
Unless, of course, we run out
of non-viewable remains.

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:44.683
You jive ass motherfucker.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.603
What kind of games
you trying to run on me?

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.208
I don't understand.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:56.482
- Is your name not Washington?
- Yeah, man, my name is Washington.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:00.770
Half the niggers in the Marine Corps
name is Washington.

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:03.320
You got the wrong man.

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:32.929
The son of a bitch
is stuck in the goddamn sand!

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:35.408
Everybody out right now, people.

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:37.523
On the beach. Spread out.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:41.400
January 23, 1968.
For once we know where we're going.

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:44.370
Intelligence located
a Vietcong tactical operation center...

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.885
and we're supposed to knock it out.

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:48.088
The Captain thinks we 're
gonna ring up a big body count.

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:51.607
But he's not going with us. I guess
after what happened the other day...

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:55.605
he wants to be sure that when we start
counting bodies, his isn't one of them.

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:58.650
Vinnie isn't still talking to me,
but I can understand that.

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:02.122
I think he was really upset about Pike
and Bisbee going down to that village.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:05.682
And he was drunk and all. So I guess
he had to take it out on somebody.

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.489
- He wants to go on foot, Harry?
- Yeah.

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:10.206
That's a goddamn minesweeper
without a three quarter-inch armour...

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.089
through a goddamned coconut grove!

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.607
- I don't like the way it smells, it stink's!
- You keep these people here and down.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.887
I'm gonna take Washington in there
and sniff around there. You got that?

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:19.325
- You be careful.
- All right.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.289
Washington, let's move out!

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.730
Get your asses down there.
Down! Down!

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.686
All right, Washington.

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:35.048
You keep your eyes on the tree tops,
I'm gonna watch the ground.

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:38.131
This is nice, sir.
I'm gonna take a picture.

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.487
Down! Get your ass down!

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:43.525
Hey, Vinnie, isn't that beautiful?

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:51.048
Oh! God Oh!

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.282
Al! Al! Shit, Al!

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.602
Corpsman! Corpsman!

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.848
Get your fucking cover here,
right now!

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.202
- Get him a medic.
- How is he?

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.201
Goddamn it!

01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:07.602
- Don't you fucking die on me, Al.
- Get us a Cobra in here.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:14.769
- Fuck. There's one over there.
- Take it easy.

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:20.011
Fuck that, you're wasting it.

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.124
Get out! Go!

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:27.969
Colonel, you let my buddy die,
I'll out your fucking heart out!

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.289
Goddamn bomb, I cant believe...

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:41.243
Harry, shut up. Dammit!

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.080
That's it, Washington.

01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:59.130
All right, squad leaders.

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.601
Detail your people to envelope
and contain that position...

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.001
according to bravo plan,
you got that?

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.842
Washington, let's reconnoiter.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.247
- Are you okay?
- I'm gonna be fine.

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.802
Goddamit, I need a...
I need a corpsman up here.

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:18.451
Goddamit I... I need
a corpsman...

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:28.966
All right.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:32.808
Third squad's in position,
fourth squad's got the back door.

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.441
People?

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:37.129
We'll flush them out now.

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.726
I want you to keep
your goddamn eyes wide open...

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.402
'cause Charlie may have
a network of tunnels up here...

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:46.530
and he could come out anywhere.
I want you to be ready for anything.

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:51.324
All right, Washington,
light that son of a bitch up.

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:02.091
All right, people, talk to me now.
Talk to me!

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:03.721
God...!

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.962
That looks like nobody's home.

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.608
May not be anybody home,
Washington.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:11.251
Some schmuck's gonna have
to walk over there and prove it.

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:12.446
Let's go.

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.885
You're listening
to the cool sound of radio Hanoi.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.849
Radio Hanoi?

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.049
God fuck it!!

01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:00.041
All the people we lost today, for what,
for a goddamn relay booster...

01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:03.044
for motherfucking Radio Hanoi?

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:08.324
Intelligence swore it was a goddamn
enemy communications center!

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.890
Hire ups and goofballs tell them
any goddamn thing they want to hear...

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.601
and they listen to him because they're
fuck heads. Goddamn fuck-heads!

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.323
Washington, do you know why
we're on this goddamn mission?

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.688
You have a battalion sitting on top
of that hill watching down at us...

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.289
...because we're gonna draw fire,
Washington. We're bait.

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:28.165
We're goddamn
motherfucking live bait!

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:31.091
It's all we are.

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:34.243
We draw them out of the bush
and those bastards on that hill...

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:38.211
...are gonna let loose with that big
fancy ass million dollar hardware.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:41.045
They can get a nice, big,
juicy body count.

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:42.886
Washington...

01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:45.129
if that's what those
motherfuckers want...

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:48.283
that is precisely what those
motherfuckers are going to get!

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:50.044
Come on, Washington.

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.328
Come on out here, Washington.

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.408
Give me the coordinates
of that hill over there.

01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:56.845
Ain't nothing on that hill.

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.729
You have been out in the bush
too long, 'cause I can clearly see...

01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.609
a whole tactical operation centre
up there.

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.808
An enemy communication centre too
and it's all being defended...

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:05.201
by an entire battalion
of MVA regulars...

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.248
- You can see that now, can't you?
- That's right!

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:08.924
- thought you would.
- I see it.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.004
You ever think what it would be like
to spend a million goddamn dollars?

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:15.289
You know something?
I think about it all the time.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.250
You'll find out what it's like right now
Washington, today.

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:21.722
Washington, what in the fuck does it
smells so bad around here?

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:26.288
Sir, you and me.

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.409
We ain't taken a bath
since Da Nang!

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.407
That's it!

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:44.848
I want more of that goddamn stuff.
More of it. Beautiful!

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.204
Oh, I love that, goddamn!

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:55.800
It's a shame the Captain
isn't here to see all those fireworks.

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:58.531
And it's also a shame that he wasn't
here to catch one of those bullets...

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:01.251
- fragged up his ass in this fireworks...
- You know something, Washington?

01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.561
It's about time we stopped talking about
blowing out someone's nuts off...

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:05.404
and start listening
to what he's saying.

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:06.845
- Listen to the Captain?
- The Captain.

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:09.008
And that bullshit he's been talking
about playing soccer to understand...

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.684
what the enemy thinks?

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:13.604
And all that bullshit about
beating that gook team, the Dragons...

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.125
- so we'd be the soccer champs?
- Right.

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.727
Be good for morale. Do you have any
idea how good for morale that'd be?

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:19.847
No.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.765
Washington, if we're
the soccer champs...

01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:25.161
we don't find our ass
in combat no more.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:26.082
Right.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.606
If we're the soccer champs, we don't
tour around the country fighting.

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:31.843
We tour around the country playing
and behind the lines.

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:35.170
Now you can call that son of a bitch
yellow bellied coward if you want.

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.762
But you don't call in MEDEVAC
for bruised shin or damaged knee.

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:41.327
And maybe that's the one thing
what we're out here for.

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:44.131
Maybe it's the only goddamn thing
we can accomplish out here.

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:47.443
Just get these little peckerwoods
out of here in one piece.

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.241
Yeah, but you see you're talking
about a soccer team now.

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.249
And we ain't got Pike.

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:57.087
And you got to face the fact.
Pike is the soccer team.

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.685
WOW!!!

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.891
Pike ain't gonna play
for the Captain.

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:08.291
You don't understand
what I'm talking about.

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.442
- You don't. We need Pike.
- We need Pike...

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:11.931
- and he's not gonna play for the Captain.
- Right.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.367
But you're gonna talk
to him into playing for us.

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.408
- You.
- I'm gonna talk him into...

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.451
You, Tyrone Washington, is gonna talk
him into playing for us. That's your job.

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.887
- My job?
- Yeah, that's your job, Washington.

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:28.610
Now let's just watch the show
and stop talking now, man.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:56.607
♫ This is what we call a soap.
It's not for eating, no, no, no. ♫

01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.084
♫ This is what we call the soap
on a cold and frosty morning. ♫

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:12.641
- What're you doing?
- I don't know. What are you doing?

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:15.405
- Jesus! Good to see you!
- You're making soap commercials, man.

01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.209
- Welcome to my community.
- This is great.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:20.409
- Beautiful. These people are so great.
- This isn't happening. I love it.

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.767
Lucy San. Lucy San.
Come here...

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:24.763
I'd like you to meet these people.

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:27.926
- Lucy San... this is Ty.
- Who?

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.207
- Lucy?
- Lucy San. This is Ty.

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.362
- And her brother Koi.
- Koi. What's happening, man?

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:35.848
This is a very good friend of mine.
Don't need to be shy, he's a great guy.

01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.083
Where's a...
Where's Dipshit? Where's Pike?

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.771
He's out there in the fields.

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:45.646
The dumb farmer looks right at home.

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:48.644
How'd you like to take a trip
to the big city, old country ass boy?

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:51.087
Damn, what the cat dragged in..

01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:55.529
The Captain's got a big soccer game
set up for us. For the championship.

01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:58.002
Us against those bad ass Dragons.

01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:00.811
And all we have to do is kick
the shit out of them...

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:04.009
and we'll be out of this shooting gallery
for the rest of our lives.

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:05.889
Well fuck him, man.

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:10.768
- I ain't playing for that son of a bitch.
- It's not for the Captain, Dipshit.

01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:14.407
It's for us. It's for the guys.
It's for the Company.

01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:17.764
The Lieutenant has fixed a way
so the whole fucking company...

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:25.530
Not just the soccer team, the whole
company can get out of combat.

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:27.445
If we win.

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.406
But how in the hell can we win
if you don't play in the game?

01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:33.010
It don't matter.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.050
We're all dead anyway.

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:36.531
That's bullshit.

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:40.481
We're gonna be sliding in and
out man. From one game to another.

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.688
Okinawa, Taiwan, Japan.

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.326
We got a chance to get out
of this goddamn Vietnam!

01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:50.051
But what the hell do you know, huh?
You're smoking that shit.

01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.487
You're so high on that shit
you don't understand nothing!

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.171
That's right.

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.926
And when I get hit man,
I ain't feeling nothing.

01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.846
Yeah?

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:01.445
Let's see if you feel this.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:23.209
You're pathetic.

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:30.051
Here's your mail.
You and Bisbee.

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.487
Get this stiff out of my jeep.

01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:40.042
Move it. On the double.

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:43.408
I'm gonna be a father!
Hey, man, I'm gonna be a father!

01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:46.165
Betsy, she's having my kid!
She's gonna have my kid!

01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:47.884
- I thought you sent her to Tijuana?
- I did!

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:50.361
I mean, I did, but I didn't.
I mean, she didn't go!

01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:53.324
- Congratulations!
- Don't you know?

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:56.051
No matter what happens, there's gonna
be something left of me in this world.

01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:58.088
A little Billy Ray Junior!

01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:00.483
- God bless you man.
- Don't stand there drooling...

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.528
like Pavlov's pups, come on,
let's get moving!

01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:03.408
What?

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:05.687
Hell, we got a soccer game
with the Dragons, man.

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.121
If we win we're out of combat.

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:10.282
Can I take Missy and Koi?

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:12.528
- Get them.
- All right!

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:15.211
This is the luckiest day
of our lives, man.

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:19.646
Damn, that's something, ain't it?

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:23.046
Pike, if you can be a father...

01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:26.371
...I guess there's hope for the world.

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:29.804
Let's move it!

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:32.326
Here you go, buddy.
Kick some ass!

01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:34.289
Bring them little yellow
piss-ants on! Go!

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.403
Forward march!

01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:49.046
Vinnie...

01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:51.203
We need you out there
today, man.

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:55.089
You gotta understand that what
happened to Foster is not your fault.

01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:56.646
Hell, it ain't.

01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:00.170
- We're gotta win this goddamn game...
- Look, I'll play okay.

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.730
I'll play. Just get off me.

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:09.848
You think we got a hope in hell?

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:12.682
I don't know shit about this game,
Captain.

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.089
Goddamn, I ain't done
with you, man!

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:23.642
Hardcore championship soccer,
the Muthuhs and the Dragons.

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:26.570
And so far, the Muthuhs are off
to a slow start. Gunny?

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:30.042
I knew there was gonna be a slow
start, but they're strong on the finish.

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.884
Shit!
Pass the motherfucker here!

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.402
Fuck you!

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:35.244
OK, Fazio, that's good!

01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:37.402
Hey, Vinnie! Vinnie Fazio!

01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:40.691
Which one is the Dago Fazio?!

01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:43.084
- Alvin!
- Smile!

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:47.004
Alvin, you're beautiful.
Look at you.

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:49.162
I can't believe it,
look at his face.

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:52.968
The ball is still in play.

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:04.769
We've got a game! We're playing
a game! Get the fuck out of here!

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:08.003
Hey, Alvin!
Al, this one's for you...

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:09.206
- my man!
- What?!

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:12.045
- Come on, do it!
- Goddamn, will you play the game?!

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:18.888
When I was in the hospital, I heard
about this game. I couldn't believe it!

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.566
How did the Captain get a game
with the Dragons?

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:24.326
- Remember that day you got hit?
- Yeah.

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.880
Well, we stormed up
that hill that day.

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:29.281
We wiped out an entire battalion
of MVA regulars.

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:32.483
We got the highest body count
in Division for the whole month.

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:34.688
The general was so pleased with us.
Well, he just pulled a few strings...

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:36.046
we got the match.

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.441
You wiped out a whole battalion?

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:45.087
You believe that Foster?

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:46.764
Yeah, yes, sir.

01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:50.610
Then they probably
ought to make you a general too.

01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:58.330
Hell, yeah, that's terrific!

01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:04.522
- Hey, Metcalfe, that's more like it.
- These are my boys, sir.

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:08.730
- They worked very hard for this.
- Where's the goddamn photographer?

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.689
There he is, sir, right here.

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:13.489
That'll look good for you, sir.

01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.328
Pike, I'm in the clear!
Come on!

01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:32.247
We're in the lead!
We're in the lead!

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:38.527
That's it!
That's it! Go, Pike!

01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:43.965
Goddamn it.

01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:53.487
What a terrific play
by Pike out there on the field.

01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:56.848
The score is now 3-1.
The whistle blows, it's half time.

01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:59.241
Like I told you, the boy starts slow,
the other side doesn't win.

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.364
We have got them by the balls
and that is the name of the game.

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:04.920
Jesus, get them to the locker room
and I'm gonna go see Gen. Sloan.

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.405
Goddamn!

01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:20.567
Let's check your package!

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:24.045
There seems to be some strange body
language going out there in the field.

01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:25.087
What is that?

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:28.004
Well, it's probably the most intelligent
question that you've ever asked me.

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:30.845
Lieutenant, we got the point.
Check your package!

01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:34.527
See, when Washington sees a good
looking woman point at his hot bottom...

01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:35.931
he checks his package.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.321
That shot was like
a good looking woman.

01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:40.323
A thing of beauty,
so he checked his package.

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.482
Checked his package.

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:46.930
Washington checks his package.
The boys check their packages.

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:50.169
And I'm checking my package.
Now you little white face...

01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:52.447
disloyal fuck,
are you checking your package?

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:53.931
Or do you have a package?

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:59.327
I want to talk to General Sloan.
Bring me to General Sloan!

01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:02.922
Well, Colonel, I think we'll find him
right over here in the grand stand.

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:05.723
Dragons, 1.

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.051
Let's go, Muthuhs!
Let's hear it for the Muthuhs!

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.645
Hooray for the Muthuhs!

01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:26.324
A little Buddha, huh?

01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:29.529
You rub his belly, you say,
for good luck?

01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:31.406
All right.

01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:33.847
Everybody, listen up!
Gather around, listen up!

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.923
All right, now, Gen. Sloan...

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.243
is so proud the way the Muthuhs
played the first half...

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.800
that he's gone ahead and arranged
the exhibition tour and the first stop...

01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:45.167
- is Saigon.
- All right!

01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:48.451
After that it's Bangkok
and then Tokyo!

01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:51.245
All right, that's what I'm
talking about, Tokyo.

01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.041
Now, there's only one small change
in plans: We're not supposed to win.

01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:58.086
- What are you talking about?
- What the hell does that mean?!

01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.650
We throw the goddamn game?!

01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:02.610
Now, you just wait a minute.
There's another way of looking at this.

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:06.890
Now, the Vietnamese go for winners.
And right now they happen to think...

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.008
-that that's the Vietcong.
That's a crock of shit.

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:12.602
Now, it's our responsibility to build up
their confidence in their government...

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:14.364
and their army
and their athletic teams.

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:17.444
- So we go around losing.
- That is a wrong way to look at it!

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:19.124
They go around winning!

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.202
Now, what's good
for the Allies is good for us.

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:24.204
I know this is not easy
because we're Marines.

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:25.566
But this is a question of priorities.

01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:28.850
Now if you're gonna disappoint
the General by beating them...

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:31.002
then we will rejoin the battalion.

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:33.526
And they're being called up
to an area called Khe Sanh.

01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:35.841
- Khe Sanh? Where the fuck is it?
- I heard about it.

01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.729
- What about it?
- It's a meat grinder.

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:38.847
A meat grinder?

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.367
All right.

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:43.681
Now we got a job to do.
We gotta be out of here by 4:00.

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:46.684
That's all the time the General has.
Let's go.

01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:50.007
Go!

01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.920
Who gives a shit who kicks
the little ball into the net more times?

01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:06.321
Come on, are you playing?

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:11.006
Come on.

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:14.888
If he's playing, I'm playing.
Let's go.

01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.441
Weren't you the man that said...

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:29.609
...that getting your guys out
in one piece...

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:32.488
...that's all that counts?

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.731
Washington...

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.490
You gotta do what's right for you.

01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:41.160
Me?

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:45.366
Man, do you really believe
that I'm doing this for me?

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.368
I never lost at anything
in my goddamn life.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:03.601
Don't fall down!
You're making it look too obvious!

01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:13.925
Oh, Jesus! You're making it
look too easy!

01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:26.802
Come on. Make them work for it!
Make it look that way!

01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:41.881
I tell you what, I'm gonna give them
one more, you hear me?

01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:44.611
- Make it 4:3 and we hold it.
- That's good enough for me.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.367
The Dragons have tied it up
at 3:3.

01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:50.523
Send my compliments to Cpt. Collins
for doing a beautiful job.

01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:56.291
All right, that's more like it.
That is more like it.

01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:57.361
All right, listen, Pike!

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:01.967
It's gorgeous, fine. Everything
just fine, don't worry about it.

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:04.008
They're gonna make one more goal.
2 would be great...

01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:06.686
- 3 would be the best we could get.
- Like hell I am.

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:10.249
Wait a minute, Pike. I don't want you
to make this into a personal problem.

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:12.527
You get that?
No personal problems.

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:15.205
Alvin, get me some water.

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:16.441
Shit, man, the Dragons is...

01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:18.045
- his fucking team.
- Who?

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:22.011
That's the son of a bitch who killed
the kid I was playing ball with!

01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:24.724
Doping kids.

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:28.409
- Look man, don't do nothing stupid.
- Stupid?

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:30.967
If winning this game is good for him,
how can it be good for us?

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:34.010
I know, I know, I know. Let's just
lose this game and go home.

01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:37.323
Dammit, man, I'm a dumb ass, right?
I'm a dumb ass.

01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:40.882
I've done some stupid things since I've
been here. I was scared shitless.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.048
The pills and all that man, I know.

01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:45.361
But I ain't never in my life done
something I'd be this ashamed of.

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:48.125
Every guy in Nam is listening
to us, man, on the radio.

01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:50.567
- Gettin' out ass whupped every game?
- Hey, man...

01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:52.847
I know how you feel. OK?

01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:56.283
- I don't wanna lose.
- Damn, its hard man.

01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:57.885
I know it's hard.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.082
But what you gonna do?
You want us to die?

01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:03.721
You want to lose people in the fucking
war, or do you wanna lose the game?

01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:06.201
Just lose the game, OK?
It's OK.

01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:09.048
- Goddamit, it's hard, man!
- I know.

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:11.484
We lose the game.

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:13.841
I heard about teamwork,
but his is ridiculous, right?

01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:15.365
- Come on.
- OK.

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:16.965
- Think of your baby, OK?
- All right.

01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:18.849
Think of your baby,
you're already a winner.

01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:20.843
- Let's lose!
- All right!

01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:23.364
All right. Let's lose this game then.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.446
All right, now they got the lead,
let's give them some insurance.

01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:32.529
Hey, look at that!
They're making fools of us.

01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:37.447
You think you got us whipped?
Come on, you little yellow piss-ants!

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:42.762
Pike!

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:43.807
Jesus!

01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:45.166
What is he doing?

01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:49.641
Little bastard!
How many times I've gotta tell ya?!

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:50.568
Pike!

01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:00.687
You see that?! You beat that!
You piss-ants!

01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:04.246
All right, all right!
Coolidge, you get ready to play!

01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:05.321
Pike, you've had it!

01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:07.323
Major, get the General!

01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:10.727
He seems to have
forgotten something!

01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:13.411
Wait, Coach Collins,
is substituting for Pike.

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:16.131
The Muthuhs will have to go ahead,
without their star player...

01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:19.090
You beautiful, disloyal fuck.

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:21.362
Just couldn't resist it,
could you, twinkle toes?

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:24.205
Well you just pulled a hamstring and
you're on your way to Khe Sanh.

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:26.044
- Just fine!
- How do you like that?!

01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.691
And the rest of you, you wanna play like
Pike again, you can join him there too!

01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:31.764
You know a tie was not in the deal.
The Dragon need another goal...

01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:33.922
let's go and give it to them!
And, Washington...

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.241
I'm holding you
personally responsible.

01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:38.964
Hey, Captain, how much
you got put in the game?

01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:41.540
- We don't wanna blow the point spread.
- Are you taking him out?

01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:44.166
Just 'cause he's the only guy
in this team with some principles?!

01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:46.641
- Fuck him! That's why I hate that guy.
- You idiot!

01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:49.166
Why don't we just make the goals
for them? It's easier.

01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:51.208
You really liked it
when he made that score.

01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:52.406
You're fucking right!

01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:55.211
I felt really good. How about you?
You're gonna bullshit everybody here...

01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:58.807
telling them you didn't dig it?
We can kick their ass like that!

01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:02.202
Tell everybody here, you big fucking
tree trunk, how you feel?

01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:05.801
You know, I had you guys
all pegged wrong.

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:09.484
You're not smart enough
to be fools and fuck-ups!

01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:13.127
But you're just about dumb enough
to try and be fucking heroes.

01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:15.202
Okay, we can look at it this way.

01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:19.928
Uncle Sam is paying us a 137 bucks
a month, to kick some ass. Right?

01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:22.005
- Huh?!
- Yeah.

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:23.606
OK.

01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:26.488
- Let's kick some ass!
- Yeah!

01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:30.407
It's coming down to the wire. The team
that scores next will be the champs!

01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:35.091
Jesus, Bisbee, let it go in!
Goddamit!

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:38.721
Bisbee saves, the Muthuhs have
the ball, with only 20 seconds to play!

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:41.486
Wait a minute.

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.410
Oh, Christ, almighty!

01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:52.481
- Come on, that's it!
- Do it, Washington, baby!

01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:53.686
Come on, do it.

01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:58.361
Yeah!

01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:04.521
Washington!

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:07.206
Missy, Koi, did you see that?
I'll be right back! I'll be right back!

01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:10.131
That's our man there!

01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:19.128
Just listen to that fireworks.

01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:20.884
Fireworks, hell! It's incoming!

01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:24.121
Incoming!
Move, move, move!

01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:28.451
All officer's into the air raid
shelter, now! Go, go!

01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:32.728
Protect Colonel Trang!
Form a human shield!

01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:35.645
Grab someone!
Protect Colonel Trang!

01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:38.405
Don't let him die!
Form a human shield!

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:43.087
Squad leaders,
get your people weapons.

01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:45.891
There's one on that roof top!
And another over there!

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.446
- Hey, you seen Missy and Koi?
- No, man.

01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:50.249
Look, we can't find anybody
in this mess!

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:51.486
I ain't seen nobody.

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:54.251
- Hey there, man!
- I can't find them!

01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:05.921
Get away from Col. Trang!
Get away, or I'll shoot!

01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.009
Stop that girl! Stop her!

01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:13.723
- Where the fuck are they?
- Up there, Lieutenant!

01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:15.171
On the building.

01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:16.885
- Lieutenant!
- Where?

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.809
Over there!

01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:25.967
- Captain Collins!
- Pike, get back to your squad!

01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:28.208
Collins, goddamit, stop running!

01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:30.322
I gave you an order, goddamn it!
Now go and do it!

01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:32.807
You're trying to save our own ass
by selling us out!

01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:34.604
Now you're gonna go into
that goddamned hole?!

01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:37.809
I gave all of you a chance to save
yourselves! What more can I do?!

01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:39.610
You can fight.
Stay with your men!

01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:41.805
Collins!

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:48.405
Oh, Jesus.

01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:51.882
You son-of-a-bitches!

01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:58.002
Oh, please, god, no!
Oh, god, Missy ....

01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:05.165
And that bastard did it!
That fat man!

01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:08.284
- Who did it?!
- That man!

01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:17.169
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you, you son-of-a-bitch!

01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:28.845
Doctor said, before he died he wanted
somebody tell his Mama what happened.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.163
And how he couldn't have
done all this in Canada.

01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:34.801
I don't get it, what did he mean?

01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:38.006
No matter what he meant,
the man's dead.

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:42.850
Come on, keep writing now.

01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:45.201
Get everything down,
don't leave nothing out.

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:49.162
You're gonna get it published too, you
got Vinnie Fazio's personal guarantee.

01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:50.611
What are you writing
in my book right now?

01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:54.044
- See that ambulance over there?
- Yup.

01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:58.330
You're getting on it, you get to a
hospital... and you just disappear.

01:59:58.440 --> 02:00:01.330
I told you once and I meant it.

02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:04.611
I ain't gonna do nothing
I'm gonna be ashamed of.

02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:07.127
I'm gonna tell you
what you got to be ashamed of.

02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:09.447
You're gonna have a little bastard
running around calling...

02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:13.690
somebody else "daddy". Now that's
what you've got to be ashamed of.

02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:16.008
- Gunny!
- Uh-uh.

02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:17.924
- Gunny!
- Tyrone...

02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:20.971
We got a man here with brain damage,
he's got a concussion.

02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:23.765
- And he won't go to a hospital.
- That's cute, man, that's real cute.

02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:25.484
You leave me no other choice.

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:27.568
I just gotta tell them there ain't
nothing wrong with me.

02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:29.728
Nobody listens to a man
with brain damage.

02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:32.605
I can't use no man
with a bruised brain.

02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:34.884
Now get on the ambulance...

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:37.283
disloyal fuck.

02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:39.130
- You got it?
- Yes, sir!

02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:44.642
You big lummox.

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:53.647
Now you don't deserve this.
You son-of-a-bitch.

02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:57.687
Now you take care of it.

02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:01.362
You take care of it, too.

02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:13.320
Old country ass boy.

02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:15.841
- Hey, Vinnie, what's his name?
- You're not gonna believe this...

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:18.042
the guy's name is Hung.
What kind of a name is Hung?

02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:20.891
We'll name him Tony, something
like that. You put that down there.

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:23.407
"Hung is now Tony."
You listen to this one, are you ready?

02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:28.087
Hey, I think there's a grenade down!
Get those kids out of the way!

02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:34.161
Al, are you all right?
Al?

02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:36.891
Al?

02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:38.406
Alvin!

02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:42.167
What did you do to yourself, Alvin?

02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:45.602
Oh, Alvin, no, no, no!

02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:47.006
God...

02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:52.920
Oh, no!

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:56.762
Oh, god...

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:10.084
Oh, no!

02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:13.130
Please.

02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:16.405
Vinnie, you're gonna go
with Washington now.

02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:19.046
Wh're gonna round up our people,
and wh're moving out.

02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:21.401
You're still alive, you hear me?

02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:24.685
All right...

02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:26.762
Bring him along, Tyrone.

02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:29.681
- Gunny!
- Yes, Sir?

02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:32.128
Get our goddamn people together,
we're moving out!

02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:33.247
Yes, sir.

02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:37.968
Oh, please, don't let them see me.
Please don't.

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:41.647
Boy, you're a man. You can cry
any goddamn time, you get ready.

02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:44.366
January 30, 1968.

02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:47.689
I don't know why I should even bother
to write in this journal anymore.

02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:51.566
Because after what happened today,
who the hell is ever gonna believe it.

02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:54.809
We actually had a chance
to get out of this goddamn war.

02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:57.890
All we had to do is
throw the game and walk away.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.129
But for some reason we just
couldn't. For some reason...

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:05.643
winning that stupid game was
more important than saving our ass.

02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.607
So I guess we just keep on walking
into one bloody mess after another...

02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:13.803
until somebody finally figures out
that living...

02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:16.685
has got to be more
important than winning.

02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:19.326
Left right, right and left.

02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:22.371
