WEBVTT

00:03.253 --> 00:05.021
Cal hartley,
eccentric gazillionaire--

00:05.088 --> 00:07.123
And my future sugar daddy--
mwah!--

00:07.174 --> 00:09.124
Saved the company from famine

00:09.176 --> 00:11.544
With a generous infusion
of cash.

00:11.611 --> 00:14.346
Yes, the seemingly preposterous
rumors are true--

00:14.414 --> 00:17.116
People are actually eating
at "mode."

00:17.184 --> 00:18.584
Yikes.

00:18.652 --> 00:21.353
(mouth full)
what? i like doughnuts.

00:25.507 --> 00:27.125
Mmm... chocolate.

00:27.209 --> 00:29.277
(hilda) ugh. please don't
be one of those

00:29.328 --> 00:31.796
"kiss with food in the mouth"
couples. that's just gross.

00:31.880 --> 00:34.582
It's such a relief that things
are finally better at meade.

00:34.633 --> 00:36.934
(betty) also, today is
our annual performance review.

00:37.019 --> 00:39.454
And i think i'm gonna ask
for a promotion...

00:39.521 --> 00:40.938
To editor.

00:41.023 --> 00:42.757
(gasps)
all right!

00:42.824 --> 00:44.826
Bravo, mija. bravo!
plus, you still have
your y.e.t.i. final project,

00:44.893 --> 00:48.146
So you'll get some
job interviews from that, too.
so will you.

00:48.230 --> 00:51.532
I know, but we were
talking about you.
wait. you're not leaving
"mode," are you?

00:51.583 --> 00:54.052
Because that's the only reason
why popular girls invite me

00:54.136 --> 00:56.854
To get manicures with them.
i'm not leaving.

00:56.939 --> 00:58.506
It's just good
to have options.

00:58.573 --> 01:01.592
I mean, she's like
manny ramirez last winter.

01:01.660 --> 01:04.278
Yeah, i don't know
what that means.

01:04.346 --> 01:06.781
A free agent? you know,
she can leverage offers

01:06.832 --> 01:08.966
Against each other,
try to get the best--

01:09.051 --> 01:11.602
Yeah, i should really
know my audience.
welcome to my world.

01:11.687 --> 01:13.654
Thanks, ignacio.
(chuckles)

01:19.311 --> 01:21.446
Oops.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.375 --> 01:34.959
Good morning, boss.

01:35.043 --> 01:37.278
I'm here
for my performance review.

01:37.329 --> 01:38.763
Good morning.

01:38.847 --> 01:40.248
Right on time, employee,

01:40.299 --> 01:44.819
Which leads nicely into...
punctuality--excellent.

01:44.886 --> 01:46.954
Attitude--excellent.

01:47.022 --> 01:50.541
It kills me to say this,
but across the board,

01:50.626 --> 01:52.994
You... are adequate.

01:53.061 --> 01:55.780
(sighs) oh, willie!

01:55.864 --> 01:58.132
You have never said that
to me before.

01:58.183 --> 02:00.518
I want to hug you.
dial it back, sister,

02:00.586 --> 02:03.121
Or i'll drop you
right back down to "subpar."
of course.

02:03.205 --> 02:06.591
Excellent. initiative--
oh, speaking of,
i booked you ten tans

02:06.675 --> 02:09.310
To get ready
for the summer.

02:09.377 --> 02:11.979
We don't want the "post"
calling you pasty again.
oh. when did they
call me pasty?

02:12.030 --> 02:13.464
Oh, last june.

02:13.549 --> 02:16.067
But you didn't see it
because i threw it away.

02:16.151 --> 02:18.119
Oh! another example
of initiative.

02:18.187 --> 02:21.322
I was hoping, in light
of my recent adequacy,

02:21.373 --> 02:24.809
That we might talk
about my... future here.

02:24.877 --> 02:27.361
Well, uh, actually,

02:27.429 --> 02:30.331
There is something
you need to know.

02:30.399 --> 02:33.167
A hiring freeze?
what does that mean?

02:33.235 --> 02:35.686
It was part of the deal
we made with hartley.

02:35.771 --> 02:38.356
We got to hire back
everyone we let go,

02:38.440 --> 02:40.241
But until someone leaves...

02:40.309 --> 02:43.311
(clears throat)
there are no new positions.

02:43.378 --> 02:46.264
And everyone
just got hired back,

02:46.348 --> 02:48.299
So why would they want
to leave?

02:48.383 --> 02:50.635
I'm so sorry, betty.

02:50.719 --> 02:53.237
Look, the thought of losing you
absolutely kills me,

02:53.322 --> 02:55.223
But i know you have
bigger aspirations than...

02:55.290 --> 02:57.191
(scoffs) booking my tans.

02:57.259 --> 03:00.077
But if an opportunity
arises at y.e.t.i.,

03:00.162 --> 03:03.581
No one will sing your praises
louder than i will.

03:19.648 --> 03:21.265
(sighs)

03:36.262 --> 03:39.264
Thanks so much for helping me
with my hair.

03:39.332 --> 03:42.518
I'm meeting your father later,
and i want to look good.

03:42.602 --> 03:45.287
Why? so he can feel worse
when you break his heart?

03:45.372 --> 03:47.556
I found this.

03:47.624 --> 03:50.359
What are you doing
going through my mail?

03:50.427 --> 03:53.345
What are you doing looking
for "nurse educator" positions

03:53.396 --> 03:54.847
In chula vista--

03:54.914 --> 03:56.815
A country
i've never even heard of?!

03:56.866 --> 03:58.917
Chula vista's
in california.

03:58.968 --> 04:01.203
And i wasn't looking
for anything.

04:01.287 --> 04:03.288
I just took
an informational meeting

04:03.340 --> 04:05.240
When i was visiting family.
(paper rustles)

04:05.325 --> 04:07.493
I never thought anythi
would come of it.

04:07.544 --> 04:11.280
So you're just gonna, what,
you're just gonna leave?
no.

04:11.348 --> 04:14.366
Ay! come on, i don't know.

04:14.417 --> 04:16.769
It's a really good job.

04:16.836 --> 04:19.704
It'd be a new challenge,
a raise.

04:19.773 --> 04:23.625
Ignacio's
a really great guy.

04:23.710 --> 04:26.095
Well, you gotta tell him
what's going on.

04:26.179 --> 04:27.963
He deserves to know.

04:28.031 --> 04:29.915
You're right.

04:29.966 --> 04:32.634
Plus, i have
a really big mouth.

04:32.719 --> 04:34.620
So if you don't tell him,

04:34.671 --> 04:37.389
He might
just find out, anyway.
(sighs)

04:37.457 --> 04:39.858
(wilhelmina) okay, let's run
through the bridal issue

04:39.926 --> 04:41.343
One last time.

04:41.428 --> 04:43.762
If anyone has any notes,
i don't care.

04:43.813 --> 04:46.098
Oh, cal,
what are you doing back?

04:46.166 --> 04:48.667
I thought
you were in siberia.
oh, they had
a damn earthquake.

04:48.718 --> 04:51.320
As soon as they clear
the bodies, i'll be back.

04:51.404 --> 04:53.405
Well, if you need
any work space,

04:53.456 --> 04:57.743
Marc will set you up.
actually, i'd rather see
what you're doing here.

04:57.810 --> 04:59.561
No pressure.

04:59.646 --> 05:02.648
Hmm.
just looking for something
to make me smile.

05:02.716 --> 05:04.249
I'm not smiling.

05:04.317 --> 05:06.718
Now i'm not saying

05:06.770 --> 05:09.238
That you have to change
your whole concept,

05:09.322 --> 05:13.242
But the wedding dresses
aren't popping.

05:13.326 --> 05:15.494
Now what if we put...
(both mouth words)

05:15.545 --> 05:18.714
The cherry 7up antioxidant ad...

05:18.798 --> 05:22.584
Between these photos?

05:22.669 --> 05:25.687
There. very nice.
breathe. i have pictures of
all of this. we will rebuild.

05:25.772 --> 05:27.256
"cherry pick
your antioxidants."

05:27.340 --> 05:29.541
See? now that's clever.
(chuckles)

05:29.592 --> 05:31.994
Excuse me, where do you
think you're going?

05:32.061 --> 05:35.247
(french accent) uh, i would
like a cherry 7up antioxidant.

05:35.314 --> 05:37.750
Well, in america,
we just say "7up."

05:37.801 --> 05:40.068
But it contains vitamin e,
a powerful antioxidant.

05:40.153 --> 05:43.856
Oh, for god sake, will you talk
like a normal person? sit down.

05:43.907 --> 05:47.309
Yeah, see, my eye still isn't
being drawn to the clothes.

05:46.393 --> 05:49.112
I don't know.
maybe we have to reshoot.

05:49.196 --> 05:51.064
(chuckles) if i may...
what?

05:51.131 --> 05:52.365
Uh, marc?
yes.

05:52.416 --> 05:54.317
It--it's not that simple.

05:54.401 --> 05:56.786
We've been working
on this concept for months.

05:56.871 --> 05:59.506
This is a little
black wedding dress.

05:59.557 --> 06:02.392
My dear friend, reem acra,
designed some things personally,

06:02.476 --> 06:03.927
As a huge favor.

06:04.011 --> 06:06.763
I think it is our best
wedding issue as of yet.

06:06.847 --> 06:10.300
All right, you don't have
to take my ideas.

06:10.384 --> 06:13.820
Of course,
you did takey money.
(claire) are you going
to be much longer?

06:13.887 --> 06:17.557
I booked this conference room
for a "hot flash" meeting.
yes, yes, yes,
your irritable bowel issue.

06:17.608 --> 06:20.360
Yeah, claire, come here.
we need another opinion.

06:20.411 --> 06:24.481
Now tell me, what do you
think of this concept?

06:24.565 --> 06:27.750
I like the idea
of doing something

06:27.818 --> 06:29.719
Other than a white wedding,

06:29.804 --> 06:31.938
But black in fashion
is just as clichÃ©.

06:31.989 --> 06:35.024
In--in europe, they're showing
color in their bridal gowns.

06:35.109 --> 06:38.044
Maybe we could try that.
see, that makes me smile.

06:38.111 --> 06:41.381
You know, maybe you can help
wilhelmina work up some...

06:41.432 --> 06:43.900
New version
of this spread, huh?
what?

06:43.984 --> 06:46.052
I'll clear my calendar.

06:47.605 --> 06:49.589
(gasps)

06:55.643 --> 06:58.612
Oh, there's something i want
to show you on the light board.

06:58.679 --> 07:01.031
I think you'll get
a kick out of it.
okay.

07:01.082 --> 07:03.416
Daniel, hey, since i don't have
a direct supervisor,

07:03.501 --> 07:05.452
I wrote
my own performance review.

07:05.536 --> 07:08.538
I am "super excellent"
in every category.

07:08.606 --> 07:10.223
Would you just sign here?
oh!

07:10.308 --> 07:12.626
Oh, my god.
i can't believe this.

07:12.693 --> 07:15.462
(romantic instrumental music
playing)
yes!

07:15.530 --> 07:17.480
Oh, i love you.

07:17.548 --> 07:19.499
(kisses)
i love you so much.

07:19.567 --> 07:21.968
Wow... it's just paula abdul
yelling at a mailbox.

07:22.053 --> 07:24.938
I was hoping for maybe
a little chuckle or something.

07:25.022 --> 07:28.308
(music warbles and fades)

07:28.392 --> 07:31.394
Oh, no, molly.
you thought i was...

07:31.445 --> 07:33.830
(sighs)
i'm sor--i'm sorry.
no.

07:33.881 --> 07:36.800
It's for
the wedding issue, obviously.

07:36.851 --> 07:39.302
Oh, no. she definitely
thought you were proposing.

07:39.353 --> 07:43.557
Yikes. that is
really embarrassing.

07:43.641 --> 07:47.644
(jodie)
and tom, carson and rita

07:47.711 --> 07:49.746
Are team three.
(laughs)

07:49.797 --> 07:53.617
Three! also the number
of martinis i had last night

07:53.668 --> 07:56.753
After my boyfriend dumped me,
but i digress.

07:56.804 --> 08:01.557
And team four
is marc, betty...

08:01.609 --> 08:03.760
And chair.

08:03.811 --> 08:05.779
Oh. "chair" is matt.

08:05.863 --> 08:07.264
He's not here.
he's coming.

08:07.331 --> 08:09.449
But he's very invested
in all of this.

08:09.533 --> 08:11.635
Uh-huh. they say
they're invested,

08:11.702 --> 08:13.904
And then they go back
to their wife.

08:13.971 --> 08:16.523
Ugh. can i get
a new team?

08:16.591 --> 08:19.092
If you like,
i could be your partner.

08:19.176 --> 08:22.195
Give you a taste of someone
with experience.

08:22.263 --> 08:24.614
Uh, i'm good with betty
and "chair."

08:24.665 --> 08:26.182
(chuckles)

08:26.250 --> 08:28.068
(door opens and closes)

08:28.152 --> 08:30.103
Hey, sorry.

08:30.187 --> 08:32.772
She's assigning final projects.
where were you?

08:32.857 --> 08:35.241
There was this amazing exhibit
at the whitney.

08:35.326 --> 08:37.277
I just lost track of time.

08:37.345 --> 08:39.361
In this bag is the key
to your future.

08:39.413 --> 08:41.831
Your final assignment
is to do a photo shoot

08:41.881 --> 08:43.316
And feature article

08:43.400 --> 08:46.252
For whatever type of magazine
you draw.

08:52.408 --> 08:53.641
"music."

08:53.726 --> 08:56.828
Hey, you didn't
screw it up.
cool!

08:56.895 --> 08:59.381
Draw again.

08:59.465 --> 09:01.349
(paper rustles)

09:01.417 --> 09:03.785
"physical sciences."
ugh.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.487
Which one's our topic?

09:05.554 --> 09:08.490
Both. you didn't think
i'd make this easy, did you?

09:08.557 --> 09:11.642
I like to spice things up.

09:13.429 --> 09:16.914
Now... i have some bad news.

09:16.966 --> 09:20.518
Due to the number
of hiring freezes

09:20.569 --> 09:22.904
In the industry this year,

09:22.988 --> 09:25.790
Y.e.t.i. will only be able
to set up job interviews

09:25.841 --> 09:27.275
For three people.

09:27.359 --> 09:30.928
That means...
only the winning team

09:30.980 --> 09:34.032
Will be getting interviews.
(people groan)

09:34.083 --> 09:36.701
What?
that was our only chance
of moving up.

09:36.752 --> 09:38.153
I'm sorry.

09:38.237 --> 09:40.922
This is just the reality
you have to deal with.

09:41.006 --> 09:42.941
And sometimes reality sucks.

09:42.992 --> 09:46.111
Okay. .

09:46.178 --> 09:48.913
All right, well, then we're
just gonna have to make

09:48.981 --> 09:51.048
The best music/physical science
magazine ever.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.851
Group hug?

09:52.918 --> 09:55.386
Oh.
ooh! aah!

09:58.491 --> 10:01.142
Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com
Thx to YYeTs.net for the transcripts.

10:07.143 --> 10:10.143
Alright, the physical science and music.
Piece of cake.

10:11.460 --> 10:14.179
Easy-squeezy.
okay, but let's start
with the visuals.

10:14.246 --> 10:15.647
Because words--
who cares?

10:15.698 --> 10:17.666
Well, uh, hmm, astronomy
is a physical science.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.185
And there's a jazz club
not too far from here.

10:20.252 --> 10:22.621
We could shoot the musicians
playing, uh, telescopes

10:22.672 --> 10:24.622
Instead of instruments.
okay, yeah,
that's something.

10:24.674 --> 10:27.092
(snores) that's nothing.

10:27.159 --> 10:30.195
We have to do something
amazing, like, eye-popping.

10:30.246 --> 10:33.364
Oh! u2 on a space shuttle.
that definitely doesn't
sound easy-squeezy.

10:33.416 --> 10:35.850
(gasps) oh, my god, you guys
have to come check out

10:35.935 --> 10:37.752
This youtube video.
some lady called 9-1-1

10:37.837 --> 10:41.006
Because they ran out
of chicken nuggets.
ooh, i heard
about that.

10:41.073 --> 10:43.959
Oh, what if we did something
at the planetarium?

10:44.043 --> 10:46.578
Ooh, and maybe use
their laser light show?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.046
But how about,

10:48.113 --> 10:50.348
Instead of pink floyd,
we use somebody current

10:50.399 --> 10:53.335
And then we style them
'70s glam rock?
and--and the article
could be about

10:53.402 --> 10:55.754
How we search to be connected
in this vast universe

10:55.805 --> 10:59.341
And music unites us.
i have no idea what that
means, but it sounded great.

10:59.425 --> 11:02.310
You write it.
great. and i'll also start
working on the logistics.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.329
You know,
booking a photographer,

11:04.380 --> 11:07.732
Getting a caterer,
that sort of stuff.
and i'll get the band.
it's only five degrees

11:07.783 --> 11:09.935
Of gay separation
from anyone good.
(amanda and matt laughing)

11:09.986 --> 11:12.770
I'm worried that
mr. "short attention span"

11:12.822 --> 11:14.623
Over there
isn't focused.

11:14.707 --> 11:16.775
Oh, don't worry.
he heard everything.

11:16.826 --> 11:19.995
Is there something
you'd like to oversee?
sure, sure, i know somebody
at the planetarium.

11:20.062 --> 11:24.015
I can give her a call.
see? all righty,
let's talk specifics.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.084
Okay, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

11:26.135 --> 11:29.253
We're about to watch a gopher
make a dramatic face.
(gasps)

11:29.305 --> 11:31.940
(dramatic music plays)

11:32.024 --> 11:33.842
Great. talk soon.

11:33.876 --> 11:35.777
(telephone rings)

11:35.861 --> 11:37.629
(betty) i got james boyd
to do our shoot.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.964
And also, my dad's gonna
do our catering.
and i can get us

11:40.016 --> 11:42.450
The new york hall of science,
but only if i act fast.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.253
So i'm just gonna go aad
and book it, okay? bye.
no, wait, marc!

11:45.338 --> 11:47.672
But matt has a contact
at the planetarium.
i know, but--

11:47.740 --> 11:49.624
(telephone rings)
oh, hold on.
i have another call.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.643
Hey.
uh, i'm on the phone
with betty.

11:51.694 --> 11:54.412
Oh, good, so we can play that
game where we forget about her

11:54.480 --> 11:56.381
And see how long
she stays on?
(click)

11:56.448 --> 11:58.349
Okay, you may not be able
to see this

11:58.401 --> 12:00.335
Because you've got
your love-blinders on,

12:00.419 --> 12:02.553
But i don't think
we can count on matt.
what?

12:02.605 --> 12:04.956
Well, one, he's been showing up
late to y.e.t.i., and two,

12:05.024 --> 12:08.259
He spent last night watching
a man build a nest on youtube.

12:08.327 --> 12:10.228
We only have four days
to put this together,

12:10.295 --> 12:12.196
And we can't afford to have
anything bringing us down.

12:12.248 --> 12:13.982
Marc, that's ridic--
(telephone rings)

12:14.050 --> 12:16.985
Oh, hold on.
daniel meade's office.
hey.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.004
(click)
look, i know
he was acting

12:19.071 --> 12:21.940
A little weird last night,
but he is just as committed

12:22.007 --> 12:25.243
To this as we are.
okay, but the "fine dining
and autos" group

12:25.311 --> 12:30.382
Already had to kick out
one of their slackers.
what is that
supposed to mean?

12:30.433 --> 12:32.684
I'm saying it's a dog eat dog world
and matt's looking a lot like lunch.

12:36.504 --> 12:39.756
I don't know. i-i can't
decide on a ring.

12:39.823 --> 12:42.259
Molly's not one
for something showy,

12:42.310 --> 12:44.744
But i cat exactly get her
something cheap, right?

12:44.812 --> 12:48.198
I don't know. am i crazy
for even talking about this?

12:48.249 --> 12:50.500
As a mother,
i think so, yes.

12:50.551 --> 12:53.136
Seeing a son getting ready
to marry a dying woman--

12:53.204 --> 12:56.472
I just hate to see you
in that much pain.

12:56.524 --> 12:59.709
Come on, it's gonna be painful
whether we get married or not.

12:59.777 --> 13:02.245
If i can make one of molly's
biggest dreams come true,

13:02.296 --> 13:04.881
I-i can't think of anything
better than that.

13:07.101 --> 13:09.185
You're absolutely right.

13:11.772 --> 13:14.407
Whatever ups and downs
your father and i had,

13:14.492 --> 13:18.695
And we had
an awful lot of both...
(chuckles)

13:18.746 --> 13:22.949
I always loved him.

13:31.175 --> 13:34.778
When the time is right,
you give that to molly.

13:39.967 --> 13:42.552
(speaking indistinctly)

13:42.603 --> 13:44.537
I think
the time is right.

13:44.605 --> 13:46.072
(betty) daniel...

13:46.140 --> 13:49.058
What? why did he just
give me the--i hate the--

13:49.110 --> 13:51.127
You, too?
(door opens)

13:51.178 --> 13:55.131
(speaking indistinctly)

13:55.182 --> 13:57.634
Oh, my god, is he...

14:03.574 --> 14:05.725
(sighs)

14:05.810 --> 14:07.327
Oh.

14:08.863 --> 14:10.513
(laughs)

14:10.581 --> 14:14.584
(people cheering
and applauding)

14:14.635 --> 14:18.655
Oh, it's so romantic,
right?

14:18.706 --> 14:21.457
Now when molly
is all losing her hair,

14:21.509 --> 14:24.110
Daniel has no choice
but to stay by her side.

14:24.195 --> 14:25.729
Hilda.

14:25.796 --> 14:28.448
What? i wish i had somebody
who would love me

14:28.532 --> 14:30.517
If i was all bald.
hmm.

14:30.584 --> 14:33.670
Well, i need to do my e-mail
when you're done.
y.

14:33.721 --> 14:35.455
Hi...
hi, papi.

14:35.539 --> 14:37.190
Aw, the sympathy "hi."

14:37.274 --> 14:39.943
I take it you all know
about elena.

14:39.994 --> 14:42.412
Has she made up her mind
about the job yet?

14:42.463 --> 14:44.881
No.

14:44.932 --> 14:48.068
I really
don't want her to go.

14:48.152 --> 14:50.520
Papi, you just have
to let her know

14:50.571 --> 14:53.256
That she has something
worth staying for.
yeah.

14:53.323 --> 14:55.325
What do you mean?

14:55.393 --> 14:58.528
If you like it, then you
shoulda put a ring on it.

14:58.595 --> 15:01.414
BeyoncÃ© knows.
he is right. you have got
to step up your game.

15:01.499 --> 15:03.400
(ignacio) i want
to step up my game.

15:03.467 --> 15:06.986
I ju thought you guys wod
have a problem with that.

15:07.054 --> 15:10.306
You ren't exactly on board
with her in the beginning.

15:10.358 --> 15:12.225
Well, we are now.
yeah.

15:12.293 --> 15:15.261
So... what are we saying?

15:15.346 --> 15:18.381
That we want a future
with elena?

15:18.432 --> 15:19.549
Uh... yeah.

15:19.616 --> 15:21.735
Duh.
hello.

15:21.819 --> 15:23.670
Gracias.

15:23.754 --> 15:27.440
Oh, my god.
we're getting engaged!

15:27.508 --> 15:30.026
(squeals) yay!
(ignacio) whoo!

15:30.094 --> 15:31.894
(hilda laughs)

15:37.365 --> 15:39.350
Oh, my god,
you're not gonna believe it!

15:39.435 --> 15:41.419
2-time grammy-award-winning
english songbird adele

15:41.503 --> 15:44.806
Agreed to do our shoot!
oh, my god!
that's amazing!

15:44.873 --> 15:46.891
You got adele?
i love her!

15:46.975 --> 15:49.694
I was able to secure it
in five degrees.

15:49.778 --> 15:51.996
The cute guy
from my cardio strip class

15:52.081 --> 15:53.981
Was a mall elf
with david sedaris,

15:54.032 --> 15:56.951
Who lives in the same building
as kevin bacon--not gay,

15:57.002 --> 15:59.337
But you always need him--
who was playing tennis

15:59.421 --> 16:01.322
With rachel maddow--
i hate to admit it,

16:01.390 --> 16:04.292
But the lesbians count--
la maddow is a huge adele fan.

16:04.359 --> 16:07.995
VoilÃ¡, winning y.e.t.i. project!
doo doo doo doo doo!
yay!

16:08.046 --> 16:10.014
Okay, i told adele's people
that we were shooting

16:10.099 --> 16:12.984
At the planetarium,
so don't let me down.
actually, uh,
it--itell through.

16:13.068 --> 16:14.469
What?
what?

16:14.536 --> 16:16.237
When i called this afternoon,

16:16.288 --> 16:18.539
They said they'd booked it
for something else.
you! (grunts)

16:18.590 --> 16:20.608
Marc!
you waited
until this afternoon?

16:20.659 --> 16:23.077
You should've left
a message last night,

16:23.128 --> 16:25.463
Followed up this morning,
sent flowers and then waited

16:25.547 --> 16:28.349
Outside their office until they
either gave you the planetarium

16:28.400 --> 16:30.851
Or had you arrested
for stalking!
look, i'm--
i'm really sorry.

16:30.903 --> 16:33.671
Sidebar!

16:36.141 --> 16:40.661
Look, we'll figure
something out.
it is too late.
lives are at stake.

16:40.712 --> 16:42.914
We are voting him
off the island.

16:42.998 --> 16:44.882
He is the weakest link!
shh!

16:44.967 --> 16:47.468
Auf wiedersehen! that's it!
good-bye! he's fired.

16:47.536 --> 16:49.704
Um, i-i can hear you,
you know.
that was the point!

16:49.755 --> 16:51.722
This was just
for dramatic effect.

16:51.807 --> 16:54.976
Do, uh, do you want
to fire me, too?

16:55.027 --> 16:56.961
No.

16:57.029 --> 16:59.964
But, matt, this is
really important to us,

17:00.048 --> 17:02.483
And i know how capable
you are.

17:02.551 --> 17:04.452
But for whatever reason,

17:04.520 --> 17:06.887
It just seems like
you don't care.

17:06.954 --> 17:09.190
You're right.

17:09.241 --> 17:11.375
You're, uh,
absolutely right.

17:11.460 --> 17:14.145
I'm gonna, uh...
get out of your way.

17:14.229 --> 17:16.731
Bye!
wait, no, matt!

17:16.799 --> 17:17.949
No!

17:20.537 --> 17:21.970
Matt, don't go!

17:22.021 --> 17:24.306
What's going on?

17:24.374 --> 17:26.392
(sighs) i didn't know
how to tell you.

17:26.476 --> 17:29.445
I've been wanting to tell you
for a while now.

17:29.496 --> 17:32.414
It's been killing me.
but i just feel like...

17:32.465 --> 17:35.634
I'm losing my passion
for publishing.
what?

17:35.702 --> 17:37.987
I think i should
leave y.e.t.i.

17:38.054 --> 17:39.955
Wait,
hold on, what happened?

17:40.023 --> 17:42.824
You're really good at this,
and i thout you loved it.

17:42.876 --> 17:44.777
I did, i did.

17:44.861 --> 17:48.297
I've just been feeling...
drawn to something else.

17:48.365 --> 17:50.132
Oh.

17:50.183 --> 17:51.951
Uh, well, like what?

17:52.035 --> 17:54.870
Art.
art?

17:54.921 --> 17:57.306
Specifically, i-i want
to paint. oil paint.

17:57.357 --> 18:00.693
Oh, well, that's sort of
out of left field.

18:00.760 --> 18:03.078
Actually, i've always been
terested in painting.

18:03.129 --> 18:05.080
And i just
can't stop feeling

18:05.131 --> 18:07.883
That maybe i got on
the wrong path.

18:07.934 --> 18:10.286
There are some night classes
i want to take.

18:10.353 --> 18:12.921
They start next week.
are you freaked out?

18:12.973 --> 18:15.975
You seem freaked out.
no, no. no, i'm not.
i'm fine. it just--

18:16.059 --> 18:18.527
It's just a lot to process,
but, you know,

18:18.578 --> 18:20.996
If you're passionate
about art, then... great.

18:21.047 --> 18:23.148
I support you 100%.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.583
(chuckles softly)

18:24.668 --> 18:26.435
Wow.

18:26.486 --> 18:28.671
That is so nice to hear.

18:28.738 --> 18:32.040
My family doesn't t-tend
to see things the same way.

18:32.092 --> 18:34.393
So... we're okay?

18:34.477 --> 18:38.063
Yes, of course we're okay.

18:38.131 --> 18:40.866
(betty) it's just
a little bit confusing.

18:40.934 --> 18:42.935
(daniel) publishing can't be
the only thing

18:43.019 --> 18:46.388
You like about him.
no, of course not.
i mean, he's sweet and--

18:46.456 --> 18:48.991
And goofy, and his bad jokes
make me laugh.

18:49.042 --> 18:51.460
And things are just better
when he's there.

18:51.511 --> 18:53.645
Yeah, well,
none of that's changed.

18:53.730 --> 18:56.281
Even though he doesn't do
the same thing as you,

18:56.366 --> 19:00.252
He's still the guy you
fell in love with, right?
wow, you've gotten all wise
since you've been engaged.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.721
(laughs) yeah.
kinda weird, right?

19:02.806 --> 19:05.691
The new york hall of science
is now saying no,

19:05.775 --> 19:07.710
And judging
by the restraining order

19:07.777 --> 19:10.462
They sent me this morning,
they mean it.
well, what are we
gonna do?

19:10.547 --> 19:13.465
(sighs)
we can't just paint stars
in your apartment

19:13.550 --> 19:15.284
And call it the planetarium.

19:15.335 --> 19:17.452
I mean, this is adele,
not amy winehouse.
(cell phone rings)

19:17.504 --> 19:20.723
Wow, betty,
that was really funny.
thank you. betty suarez.

19:20.774 --> 19:23.359
We're never
gonna be editors.
yeah, of course
i can be there today.

19:23.410 --> 19:26.729
I'm gonna go
kill myself now.
thank you.
we got the planetaum!

19:26.796 --> 19:29.498
Oh, my god,
that is great!
i just have to go down
and sign the contract.

19:29.566 --> 19:33.034
Okayi'll--
i'll go with you
(wilhelmina)
are you out of your mind?!

19:33.086 --> 19:35.187
Maybe not.
go. go, go.

19:35.271 --> 19:37.823
(wilhelmina) oh, her bust
looks nonexistent.

19:37.891 --> 19:39.375
For god sake, claire,

19:39.442 --> 19:42.511
Put your bifocals on.
she looks hideous.
how insensitive of me.

19:42.562 --> 19:44.746
The love of your life
stole all your money

19:44.798 --> 19:48.083
And fled the continent
just to get away from you.

19:48.134 --> 19:51.553
So no wonder you don't like
a happy wedding dress.
she looks like
a baboon's ass.

19:51.604 --> 19:54.406
She didn't mean that.
oh, stop talking
to the props, amateur.

19:54.491 --> 19:57.409
Would anyone like
a nice, warm scone?
you might not remember
your wedding

19:57.477 --> 19:59.428
Because it was
5,000 years ago,

19:59.495 --> 20:01.764
But when i married your husband,
it was all about class.

20:01.815 --> 20:04.450
And this dress
has none of it.
well, no wonder

20:04.534 --> 20:06.635
You prefer to put brides
in black dresses,

20:06.686 --> 20:08.804
Since you killed your groom
at the altar.

20:08.855 --> 20:10.722
(whispering) we're gonna
get you out of here.

20:10.807 --> 20:12.708
Just wait for my cue.
(sighs) take off
the dress.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.409
Don't touch that dress.

20:14.461 --> 20:17.529
Don't touch my model.
you let go
of my model.

20:17.597 --> 20:20.866
All right! all right! now!
move! move! move!

20:20.934 --> 20:22.651
Serpentine, serpentine!
you let go!

20:22.702 --> 20:25.137
Just get over here!
(grunts)

20:25.205 --> 20:27.156
(whimpers)

20:27.207 --> 20:29.191
Such a shame.

20:33.060 --> 20:36.413
Yeah, my goal is to give you
the perfect wedding,

20:36.497 --> 20:38.097
And, groom, little hint--

20:38.149 --> 20:40.400
"perfect" means
whatever she wants. yeah.

20:40.451 --> 20:43.920
Understood.
what kind of venue
did you have in mind?

20:43.988 --> 20:46.723
Hotel bora bora, on the beach
under the stars.
"stars."

20:46.791 --> 20:48.575
Outside?
what if it rains?
groom.

20:48.642 --> 20:50.427
Ouide's perfect.

20:50.511 --> 20:52.345
Right.
and i want it
to be like a party.

20:52.396 --> 20:54.848
Tacos and margaritas instead
of lobster and champagne.

20:54.916 --> 20:56.850
And a band
with everyone dancing.

20:56.901 --> 21:00.403
Is this too much?
no. i want you to have
whatever you want.

21:00.488 --> 21:02.789
Well, it all looks
very doable.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.925
So what date
did you have in mind?

21:04.976 --> 21:07.127
We were kind of thinking
as soon as possible.

21:07.194 --> 21:09.079
Like--like the end
of the month.

21:09.147 --> 21:10.747
This month?
mm-hmm.

21:10.832 --> 21:12.732
Mr. meade,
a-a wedding like this

21:12.800 --> 21:15.285
Would normally take at least
eight or nine months.

21:15.369 --> 21:18.238
But it is what she wants.

21:18.289 --> 21:20.557
Let's just make it happen.

21:20.641 --> 21:22.843
Okay. a-absolutely.

21:36.224 --> 21:38.058
Hello?

21:39.594 --> 21:42.028
Hello?

21:42.079 --> 21:44.130
Hello?

21:44.198 --> 21:47.717
(richard strauss' "also sprach
zarathustra" playing)

21:47.785 --> 21:51.137
Hello, betty.

21:56.410 --> 21:58.178
Mrs. hartley.

21:58.229 --> 22:00.163
What are you doing here?

22:00.248 --> 22:02.916
I'm here to see you.

22:06.971 --> 22:09.272
So when i heard
you needed this space

22:09.357 --> 22:11.742
For your y.e.t.i. project,
i called my friend bitsy,

22:11.809 --> 22:13.560
Who's on the board
of the planetarium,

22:13.627 --> 22:15.579
Reminded her
of a few things i saw

22:15.663 --> 22:17.631
At last year's
christmas party...

22:17.682 --> 22:19.899
(chuckles)
and it's yours.
wow, um...

22:19.951 --> 22:22.368
Why are you doing this
for me?

22:22.420 --> 22:25.672
I mean, we didn't exactly
get off to a great start.

22:25.740 --> 22:27.140
Excellent observation.

22:27.208 --> 22:29.393
Now don't choke
on your adult braces.

22:29.477 --> 22:31.728
I'm dimming the lights.

22:31.813 --> 22:34.247
We put this together
last year...

22:34.315 --> 22:36.967
For an intervention
the family did for matt.

22:37.034 --> 22:39.119
An intervention?
(projector clicks)

22:39.186 --> 22:42.656
Here's matt at mile 25 of
the new york city marathon.

22:42.723 --> 22:44.891
Wow. i didn't even know
he ran a marathon.

22:44.959 --> 22:48.678
He didn't.
a marathon is 26.2 miles.

22:48.763 --> 22:50.731
Mile 25 is when matt
developed a new passion...

22:50.798 --> 22:52.282
(click)
for karate.

22:52.350 --> 22:54.918
Here's matt getting
his brown belt.
(click)

22:54.986 --> 22:57.921
And here he is on his way
to develop his new passion...

22:57.989 --> 23:00.056
Pottery.

23:00.124 --> 23:01.458
(click)
and here--

23:01.542 --> 23:04.211
Oh, that's your mushroom cap
on my painting.

23:04.262 --> 23:06.847
How did that get in there?
(click)

23:06.898 --> 23:10.016
Ah. here is matt
with a cow.
i don't get it.

23:10.067 --> 23:12.586
He was studying to be
a large-animal vet.

23:12.653 --> 23:16.039
His dream was to heal
an elephant. his dream died.

23:16.124 --> 23:18.024
So did tiny.
(click)

23:18.092 --> 23:19.793
Why are you
showing me these?

23:19.844 --> 23:22.145
Well, it does seem odd, given
th i don't care for you,

23:22.230 --> 23:24.448
But in this case,
your plucky immigrant zeal

23:24.532 --> 23:26.433
Could be a good thing.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.301
I want matt back
in y.e.t.i.

23:28.369 --> 23:31.621
Well, he's pretty passionate
about art now.

23:31.706 --> 23:34.240
He always starts
that way.

23:34.292 --> 23:37.511
I don't want matt to be one
of those incredibly rich men

23:38.312 --> 23:40.213
Who never accomplish
anything.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.832
I think if he finishes
this program,

23:42.900 --> 23:44.850
He'll stick with publishing.

23:44.935 --> 23:47.036
Of course,
i can't tell him that.

23:47.104 --> 23:50.506
It has to come
from you.

23:50.574 --> 23:52.108
Uh, mrs. hartley,

23:52.159 --> 23:55.211
I-i really don't feel
comfortable doing that.

23:55.278 --> 23:57.513
I understand.

23:57.581 --> 24:00.349
Well,
enjoy the planetarium.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.985
I know how important
this project is for you

24:03.036 --> 24:04.554
And your career.

24:06.605 --> 24:09.974
It'd be such a shame
if anything went wrong.

24:13.161 --> 24:15.095
(marc) wake up and smell
the quid pro quo.

24:15.146 --> 24:17.047
Of course she's gonna
take it away

24:17.115 --> 24:20.017
If we don't get matt
back in.
well, i don't know
what to do.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.485
On one hand, it seems
like i'm using matt

24:21.570 --> 24:23.471
To finish the project.
not seeing the problem.

24:23.538 --> 24:25.473
And then on the other hand,

24:25.524 --> 24:27.425
I really do want to
help matt finish something.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.393
We all do. we want
to help him commit.

24:29.478 --> 24:31.412
But then on the other hand,

24:31.463 --> 24:33.881
I'm only hearing his
mother's side of the story.

24:33.932 --> 24:37.184
Maybe matt has
a whole different story.
and now you got
three hands,

24:37.235 --> 24:40.604
Which in a weird way,
balances out your two heads.
marc, help me.

24:40.689 --> 24:44.158
Okay, look. i don't care
about your relationship.

24:44.225 --> 24:46.127
What i care about
is my future,

24:46.194 --> 24:48.112
And if we don't have matt
in the group,

24:48.196 --> 24:50.531
Then we don't get
the planetarium,

24:50.582 --> 24:52.633
And then our entire
final project is dead.

24:52.684 --> 24:54.702
Look, we're out of options
at "mode."

24:54.769 --> 24:57.838
Just make it work.

24:57.906 --> 25:00.307
(elena) it's so nice of you
to make me lunch.

25:00.375 --> 25:03.510
What's the occasion?
since when do i need an occasion
to make my girlfriend a meal?

25:03.562 --> 25:06.280
Oh! oh, i'm so sorry.
it's okay.

25:06.331 --> 25:08.382
Oh! smooth, 'nacio.

25:08.450 --> 25:12.052
Let me get that.
no, it's o--
i'll get it.

25:12.104 --> 25:13.587
Are you okay?

25:13.655 --> 25:16.140
(sighs) no.

25:16.224 --> 25:19.026
I know you're considering
that job, but...

25:19.093 --> 25:20.494
I love you, elena.

25:20.545 --> 25:22.796
And i think we have
a future together.

25:22.848 --> 25:27.651
At least,
i hope we do.

25:27.719 --> 25:30.187
(sighs)

25:30.272 --> 25:32.323
Will you marry me?

25:37.145 --> 25:39.613
Oh, my god.

25:39.664 --> 25:42.266
You're leaving me
hanging here.

25:42.350 --> 25:45.152
If--if it's about the ring,
i promise, it's coming.

25:45.220 --> 25:48.939
Shut up and kiss me.

25:51.126 --> 25:52.793
Is that a "yes"?

25:52.844 --> 25:54.912
Yes.
(laughs)

25:54.996 --> 25:56.997
Yes.

25:57.048 --> 25:59.366
Yes, yes.

25:59.417 --> 26:01.635
(both laugh)

26:03.622 --> 26:05.055
Art books.

26:05.123 --> 26:07.024
Wow.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.059
Matt, i've been thinking--

26:09.144 --> 26:11.061
And don't hate me
for saying this--

26:11.146 --> 26:14.314
But do you think maybe it would
be worth it to finish y.e.t.i.

26:14.366 --> 26:16.667
Before moving on
to the next thing?
oh, boy.

26:16.751 --> 26:18.736
I mean, there's only
one week left,

26:18.820 --> 26:20.704
And i really miss
having you there.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.222
And besides, your art class

26:22.274 --> 26:24.124
Doesn't even start
till next week,

26:24.176 --> 26:26.944
So i just
don't see a downside.
wow, you sound
like my mother.

26:27.028 --> 26:29.947
Oh, no, no,
i'm--i'm sorry.
no, it's okay, it's okay.
somehow, coming from you,

26:30.031 --> 26:32.900
It doesn't make me
want to break things.

26:32.968 --> 26:35.553
And maybe i was
a little... selfish,

26:35.637 --> 26:37.738
Leaving you guys
in the lurch like that.

26:37.805 --> 26:40.941
So... you'll come back?

26:40.992 --> 26:44.528
Well, when you do that cute
squinty thing with your eyes,

26:44.613 --> 26:47.665
How could i say no?
yay!

26:47.749 --> 26:50.634
And don't worry.
you're nothing like my mother.

26:56.379 --> 26:58.280
A little, uh,
a little less bouffant.

26:58.348 --> 27:00.265
We're going more, um,
'70s and '60s,

27:00.316 --> 27:02.251
And, you know, some of
the aliens are sweating.

27:02.335 --> 27:04.553
Can you, uh, take a look
before we shoot?
uh-huh.

27:04.637 --> 27:07.022
Hi. you ready to go?
you're really good at this.
i'm glad you're back.

27:07.106 --> 27:09.541
Me, too. oh, uh, you know,
we need to test those lights.

27:09.609 --> 27:12.344
I don't want them to interfere.
i think they're strobing.

27:12.411 --> 27:15.681
Betty, this is dave sheehan,
adele's manager.
(gasps)
oh, my god. hi.

27:15.732 --> 27:17.766
I am such a huge fan
of adele.

27:17.834 --> 27:20.018
We are so happy that
she's doing our shoot.

27:20.086 --> 27:22.321
Yeah. no. me, too.
real happy. whoo.

27:22.388 --> 27:25.190
So what is this--some kind
of, uh, school project?

27:25.241 --> 27:28.159
It's y.e.t.i.,
the young editors--
whatever. you know, i could
kill her for doing this.

27:28.211 --> 27:30.112
Okay.

27:30.196 --> 27:32.080
Maybe you're getting
some lens glare.

27:32.165 --> 27:34.232
We're gonna be taking shots
from this side of the--
hi.

27:34.284 --> 27:36.335
Mom, um, what--
what are you doing here?

27:36.402 --> 27:38.437
Well, i just had lunch
with bitsy.

27:38.488 --> 27:40.822
As usual, hers was liquid.
(chuckles)

27:40.907 --> 27:43.875
But she said you were here,
finishing your y.e.t.i. project.

27:43.926 --> 27:46.962
I was sure it was
drunken ramblings, but...

27:47.030 --> 27:48.897
Here you are.

27:48.982 --> 27:51.333
I'm proud of you.

27:51.417 --> 27:53.068
I'm just glad that you're--

27:53.152 --> 27:55.821
That you're
seeing something through.

27:55.872 --> 27:59.174
Now i'm gonna go before i ruin
our little mother-son moment.

27:59.258 --> 28:03.495
(indistinct conversations)

28:03.546 --> 28:05.430
(speaking inaudibly)

28:05.498 --> 28:07.532
(whispers) thank you.

28:07.583 --> 28:10.736
(indistinct conversations)

28:10.787 --> 28:12.270
Betty...

28:12.338 --> 28:14.623
Did my mother
put you up to this?

28:18.778 --> 28:20.529
Wow.

28:20.596 --> 28:22.531
(chuckles) hey,
you ready for lunch?

28:22.615 --> 28:24.566
Hey, perfect timing.

28:24.634 --> 28:27.803
Brent was just walking me
through the wedding gift guide.

28:27.870 --> 28:30.489
Maybe he can give us
a few ideas.
you guys
are getting married?

28:30.556 --> 28:33.458
Mm-hmm.
that is so great... that
you're allowed to do that.

28:33.526 --> 28:37.279
You should totally register
for this copper-lined cookware.

28:37.363 --> 28:42.150
You two will be cooking with
these for the next 50 years.

28:44.053 --> 28:49.041
That's a long time.
oh, please. the first year
of marriage flies by...

28:49.108 --> 28:50.909
Or so i hear.

28:50.977 --> 28:52.994
Anyway, then you'll be
having babies.

28:53.079 --> 28:54.980
So look at this.

28:55.048 --> 28:59.785
Jeanette valois is
the "it" artist for nurseries.

28:59.836 --> 29:02.220
If you're even thinking
about having kids,

29:02.288 --> 29:04.906
You should book her
right now.

29:04.974 --> 29:07.859
This is a mistake.
i can't get married.
molly.

29:07.910 --> 29:10.095
I'm just gonna
go grab lunch.

29:10.146 --> 29:12.898
Hey...
oh, my god. i can't
believe i let myself

29:12.949 --> 29:16.268
Get caught up
in all this.
stop. hey.

29:16.319 --> 29:18.053
We can do this.

29:18.137 --> 29:21.189
Look...

29:21.274 --> 29:25.043
You've been able to give me
a lot of things,

29:25.094 --> 29:28.280
But you can't give me
more time.

29:32.349 --> 29:35.968
(telephone rings)

29:36.053 --> 29:37.236
(sighs)

29:37.321 --> 29:38.604
(ring)

29:38.689 --> 29:40.206
Hello.

29:40.290 --> 29:42.341
No. elena doesn't
work here anymore.

29:42.426 --> 29:44.877
But i can give her
a message.

29:44.945 --> 29:46.245
Hang on.

29:46.313 --> 29:48.831
(opens drawer
and pulls out objects)

29:48.898 --> 29:50.383
Okay.

29:54.504 --> 29:56.322
Well...

29:56.406 --> 29:59.759
I'll be sure to ask her.

29:59.843 --> 30:01.761
(hangs up receiver)

30:01.845 --> 30:03.746
I can't work like this.

30:03.797 --> 30:06.682
I run the top fashion magazine
in the world,

30:06.750 --> 30:08.651
And claire meade
does a dinky insert

30:08.718 --> 30:10.419
For menopausal old ladies.

30:10.470 --> 30:12.855
My dinky little insert
improves "mode's" circulation

30:12.922 --> 30:14.924
Every time it runs,
and--
shh!

30:14.991 --> 30:17.476
Cal, you kept me
because i'm the best

30:17.561 --> 30:19.462
In the business,
and as the best,

30:19.529 --> 30:21.714
There are three c's
that i avoid...
(sighs)

30:21.798 --> 30:24.183
Collaborion, compromise
and claire.

30:24.268 --> 30:26.819
And trust me, i chose
the nice "c" there.

30:26.903 --> 30:29.672
And what do you have
to say?

30:29.739 --> 30:31.974
She's absolutely right.

30:32.025 --> 30:33.876
And while i think
i actually did fix

30:33.943 --> 30:36.212
Her bizarr little
black wedding dress concept,

30:36.280 --> 30:38.197
The spread
is never going to get done

30:38.282 --> 30:41.167
With both of us working on it,
so for the sake of "mode,"

30:41.251 --> 30:43.552
I'd like to take myself
off this project.

30:43.603 --> 30:45.938
What game
are you playing?

30:46.006 --> 30:47.406
No game.

30:47.974 --> 30:49.992
Life's too short.

30:50.043 --> 30:53.728
So i guess
you're offhe project.

30:53.780 --> 30:56.131
Well, thank you.

30:56.199 --> 30:59.334
Claire, i'd like to have
a word with you.

31:01.988 --> 31:04.907
I just--i-i-i can't believe
that you went behind my back

31:04.958 --> 31:07.309
And met with my mother.
matt, it wasn't
li that.

31:07.377 --> 31:09.828
Because it seems to me like
you got me to rejoin y.e.t.i.

31:09.913 --> 31:12.831
Just so you could have
this stupid planetarium.
no, matt, i thought that
i was helping you.

31:12.899 --> 31:14.800
Oh, wait, let me guess,
let me guess.

31:14.884 --> 31:17.603
She show you
the slide show?
well, yes.

31:17.687 --> 31:19.221
Look,
tiny didn't die, okay?

31:19.288 --> 31:21.690
My mother was manipulating you.
that's what she does.

31:21.757 --> 31:23.675
How could you
believe her?
matt, i'm sorry,

31:23.760 --> 31:26.178
But some of what she said
actually made sense.

31:26.262 --> 31:28.480
You are passionate about
a lot of different things.

31:28.565 --> 31:31.450
Uh-huh, and maybe i'm that way
because i like a challenge.

31:31.534 --> 31:34.035
Did that even occur to you?
look, i'm not just
gonna keep quiet

31:34.087 --> 31:36.939
If i think you're making
a mistake.
god. betty, do you
even hear yourself?

31:37.006 --> 31:39.374
Not everybody has
their life planned out

31:39.442 --> 31:41.209
The way that you do.
that's not the point!

31:41.261 --> 31:45.097
You start things
that you d't finish.
oh, what,
like a y.e.t.i. project?

31:45.164 --> 31:47.699
Don't say it like that. you know
that this is important to me.

31:47.767 --> 31:50.285
And it was important to you
until it wasn't.

31:50.336 --> 31:53.088
Yeahwell, so i changed
my mind. so what?
so what?

31:53.139 --> 31:55.557
So how's that supposed
to make me feel about us?

31:55.608 --> 31:57.960
Are you just gonna
change your mind someday?

31:58.027 --> 32:00.062
Hey! we lost adele.

32:00.129 --> 32:02.364
What?
her manager heard you
two fighting

32:02.415 --> 32:04.883
And called this amateur hour.
i agreed with him

32:04.968 --> 32:07.502
And then offered to give adele
a foot massage,

32:07.554 --> 32:10.439
Which didn't work, either,
so she's gone.
well, who are you calling?

32:10.490 --> 32:12.374
Jodie.
she's my only hope.

32:12.425 --> 32:13.625
Hey, jodie...

32:13.710 --> 32:15.460
(deepens voice) this is,
uh, marc st. james.

32:15.528 --> 32:17.579
I was wondering
if you wanted to grab a beer

32:17.647 --> 32:19.264
And watch straight porn.

32:19.349 --> 32:22.234
So you're just gonna leave?
yeah, well, i might as well

32:22.318 --> 32:25.187
Live up to my reputation
for not finishing things.

32:25.255 --> 32:27.172
(indistinct conversations)

32:27.257 --> 32:28.991
(sighs)

32:36.306 --> 32:38.808
Hey, i thought i'd come by
to support you, but...

32:38.859 --> 32:41.661
It looks like i'm too late.
what happened?

32:41.745 --> 32:43.746
We lost adele,
marc stormed off,

32:43.797 --> 32:46.415
And i got into a fight
with matt,

32:46.466 --> 32:48.901
So there goes
my y.e.i. project,

32:48.986 --> 32:50.836
My professional future

32:50.904 --> 32:53.055
And my rationship.

32:53.106 --> 32:56.425
Wow. it actually sounds
like you might've had

32:56.476 --> 32:58.561
A worse day than i did.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.763
Molly canceled our wedding.

33:00.830 --> 33:02.281
What?

33:02.366 --> 33:06.385
It was too much to get done
and not enough time.

33:06.470 --> 33:09.471
Oh, betty.

33:09.523 --> 33:11.440
I mean,
the wedding planner quit.

33:11.508 --> 33:13.642
The hotel was booked
until the winter.

33:13.694 --> 33:16.579
I just--i wanted it to be
perfect for her, but...

33:16.646 --> 33:18.581
God, if it was up to me,

33:18.632 --> 33:20.716
I would just forget about
all this stuff

33:20.767 --> 33:23.519
And marry her right now.
really?

33:23.570 --> 33:26.405
Well, why don't you?
right here.
(laughs) yeah.

33:26.490 --> 33:28.074
No, i'm serious.

33:28.141 --> 33:30.359
Daniel, we have
this ven all night.

33:30.410 --> 33:33.562
There's a photographer,
wedding gowns at "mode."

33:33.613 --> 33:35.464
And tacos are coming.

33:35.515 --> 33:38.017
You said molly wanted tacos...
and stars.

33:38.101 --> 33:41.437
I mean, maybe it's not
perfect, but...

33:41.504 --> 33:43.856
Maybe "perfect" just looks
a little different

33:43.940 --> 33:46.659
Than you imagined.
what about your
y.e.t.i. project?

33:46.743 --> 33:49.261
Uh, i don't have
a y.e.t.i. project.

33:49.346 --> 33:51.514
And this is
way more important.

33:51.565 --> 33:53.766
I don't know. really?

33:53.834 --> 33:56.085
Yes. go. get molly.

33:56.136 --> 34:00.322
I can take care
of everything else.
okay, all right.

34:07.029 --> 34:09.614
(woman) do you, molly,
take daniel

34:09.665 --> 34:11.833
To be your
lawfully wedded husband,

34:11.917 --> 34:14.119
For richer, for poorer,

34:14.186 --> 34:16.204
In sickness
and in health,

34:16.288 --> 34:18.973
For as long
as you both shall live?

34:19.058 --> 34:20.475
I do.

34:20.543 --> 34:22.877
And do you, daniel,
take molly...

34:22.962 --> 34:25.346
I don't mean to cast doubt
on this lovely ceremony,

34:25.431 --> 34:28.666
But is this
legally binding?
oh, yeah, she was
an ordained minister

34:28.717 --> 34:31.302
Before she decided to become
an actress/model.

34:31.353 --> 34:33.036
How perfect is that?

34:33.088 --> 34:35.356
(woman) for richer,
for poorer...
a mother's dream.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.308
In sickness
and in health,

34:37.359 --> 34:40.460
For as long
as you both shall live?

34:40.545 --> 34:42.630
I do.

34:42.715 --> 34:47.135
Then by the power vested in me
by the state of new york

34:47.219 --> 34:49.603
And the supreme ministry
of exlon-4...

34:49.688 --> 34:51.272
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

34:51.340 --> 34:54.708
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.094
(mendelshn's "wedding march

34:57.162 --> 34:58.863
From "midsummer night's dream'"
playing)

34:58.931 --> 35:01.166
(cheers and whistles)

35:01.217 --> 35:04.919
(music continues)

35:09.558 --> 35:11.776
(yeah yeah yeahs)
? shake it ?

35:11.844 --> 35:14.612
? like a ladder
to the sun ?

35:14.663 --> 35:16.564
(indistinct conversations)

35:16.649 --> 35:18.016
Hello.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.735
Mm.
isn't this
a wonderful night?

35:20.803 --> 35:24.138
Yes, yes, yes, you're finally
marrying off your man-whore.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.757
(chuckles)

35:25.824 --> 35:28.459
Oh... you haven't heard.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.428
Cal liked
my creative instincts.
(sighs)

35:30.479 --> 35:33.164
He also liked
that i put the magazine

35:33.232 --> 35:36.317
Ahead of my own ego.
isn't there
anmpty shot glass

35:36.402 --> 35:40.238
You could be
blathering into?
so he made me senior
vice president of meade.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.373
I report only to him.

35:42.424 --> 35:45.960
I also have a say in all
of meade publications,

35:46.045 --> 35:47.495
Including "mode."

35:47.580 --> 35:49.998
So try and clear some time
on monday

35:50.082 --> 35:52.800
To pitch me your ideas.

35:52.868 --> 35:56.221
This really is
a wonderful night.

36:03.045 --> 36:05.146
Out of my way, alien!

36:09.752 --> 36:11.703
(screaming inaudibly)

36:11.770 --> 36:14.505
(big band music playing)

36:14.573 --> 36:17.441
(man) ? if it wasn't for you ?

36:17.493 --> 36:20.077
? what can i say? ?

36:20.129 --> 36:22.447
You really throw
one hell of a wedding.

36:22.514 --> 36:26.150
Well, thank you. i'm just
glad it all worked out.

36:26.218 --> 36:27.552
And you were right.

36:27.620 --> 36:30.888
"perfect" doesn't always
look like you'd imagine.
hmm.

36:30.956 --> 36:35.443
(clears throat)
um, may i, uh, cut in?

36:35.527 --> 36:36.928
Mm-hmm.

36:36.979 --> 36:39.097
? darling, i had no clue ?

36:39.164 --> 36:41.749
Uh, look, if i step on your
toes, it's nothing personal.

36:41.834 --> 36:44.719
Remember, i'm not
a very good dancer.
if i step on your toes,

36:44.803 --> 36:47.272
It's probably because
i'm still mad at you.

36:48.339 --> 36:52.142
Look, i know it must be hard
for someone like you

36:52.209 --> 36:55.112
To date a guy like me,
but i want

36:55.179 --> 36:57.531
Exactly the same thing
that you do--

36:57.615 --> 37:00.384
To have something
that i'm passionate about.

37:00.451 --> 37:04.338
And i don't know why
i haven't found my thing yet,

37:04.405 --> 37:06.122
But i'll keep trying.

37:06.174 --> 37:09.609
Just please
don't give up on me.

37:09.677 --> 37:11.278
!

37:11.362 --> 37:13.263
That was my toe.
ooh... i warned you.

37:13.314 --> 37:16.066
Hey, matt, is this the girl
you were telling me about?

37:16.134 --> 37:18.085
Aah! oh, my god.
that's adele.

37:18.169 --> 37:20.504
What is she doing here?
what are you doing here?

37:20.555 --> 37:23.506
Your photo shoot,
i believe.
mm-hmm.

37:23.558 --> 37:25.525
And i heard i was getting
a foot massage.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.461
Never had one before.
oh, my god,
me neither.

37:27.528 --> 37:30.297
We have that in common. i have
something in common with adele.
(chuckles)

37:30.381 --> 37:33.383
Well, very nice to meet you.
i bett get started.
oh, i prioritize
work, too.

37:33.434 --> 37:35.652
We have two things
in common.

37:35.703 --> 37:37.788
Ta-ra! take care.
ta-ra!

37:37.855 --> 37:39.940
Matt, i don't even know
what to say.

37:40.024 --> 37:43.777
Well, i may not be committed
to publishing anymore,

37:43.861 --> 37:46.279
But i di't want there
to be any doubt

37:46.364 --> 37:48.582
About my commitment
to you.

37:48.666 --> 37:51.051
I love you.

37:51.135 --> 37:56.323
(etta james) ? at last ?

37:58.593 --> 38:00.077
? my love ?

38:00.111 --> 38:02.496
I guess we're next.

38:02.580 --> 38:06.666
I do have something
for you.

38:06.751 --> 38:08.719
? my lonely days ?

38:08.786 --> 38:11.772
Wow, that was quick.

38:11.856 --> 38:14.441
?

38:14.525 --> 38:17.160
A plane ticket.

38:17.211 --> 38:18.729
I don't understand.

38:18.780 --> 38:21.531
They, um, called
from the hospital.

38:21.599 --> 38:24.484
They said you haven't
turned the job down yet.

38:24.569 --> 38:26.219
Ignacio...

38:26.304 --> 38:28.655
Shh, shh, shh.

38:28.740 --> 38:31.124
Getting married now, i...

38:31.209 --> 38:33.927
(sighs)
it's not the right time.

38:34.011 --> 38:36.880
? ...are blue ?

38:39.016 --> 38:40.917
? my heart... ?

38:41.002 --> 38:42.903
This is
a great opportunity.

38:44.987 --> 38:47.572
I still love you.

38:47.656 --> 38:49.758
But if i'm committed
to you,

38:49.825 --> 38:52.811
Then it has to be about
what's right for you...

38:52.878 --> 38:54.429
Not me.

38:56.465 --> 38:59.584
Well, we'll still see
each other...

38:59.668 --> 39:01.953
Long-distance.

39:02.021 --> 39:04.556
Yeah.

39:04.623 --> 39:06.841
Sure.

39:06.892 --> 39:09.527
? a thrill that i... ?

39:09.595 --> 39:12.564
(adele's "right as rain"
playing)

39:14.450 --> 39:18.636
? who wants to be
right as rain? ?

39:18.704 --> 39:22.323
? it's better
when something is wrong ?

39:22.374 --> 39:25.443
? you get excitement
in your bones ?

39:25.528 --> 39:29.063
?nd everything you do
is a game ?

39:29.115 --> 39:32.450
? when night comes
and you' on your own ?

39:32.535 --> 39:34.886
? you can say
i chose to be alone ?

39:34.954 --> 39:36.371
(camera shutter clicks)

39:36.438 --> 39:39.174
? who wants to be
right as rain? ?

39:39.241 --> 39:42.944
? it's harder
when you're on top ?

39:43.012 --> 39:46.881
? 'cause when hard work
don't pay off and i'm tired ?

39:46.949 --> 39:50.068
? there ain't no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned ?

39:50.152 --> 39:52.754
? so wipe
that dirty smile off ?

39:52.821 --> 39:55.056
? we won't be making up ?

39:55.123 --> 40:00.411
? i've cried my heart out,
and now i've had enough ?

40:00.496 --> 40:05.049
? of love, oh, oh ?

40:05.134 --> 40:07.101
(camera shutter clicks)

40:07.169 --> 40:10.788
(jodie) so...
a couple getting married...

40:10.873 --> 40:14.692
A space alien...

40:14.777 --> 40:17.278
A crazy woman
smashing planets...

40:17.329 --> 40:20.281
And adele.

40:20.349 --> 40:23.334
I love it. it's weird.

40:23.419 --> 40:25.153
It's thought-provoking.

40:25.204 --> 40:27.822
And the piece you wrote
about music

40:27.873 --> 40:31.359
Being the great uniter
in the vast universe...

40:31.410 --> 40:33.878
It's brilliant.

40:33.963 --> 40:37.365
You are
the y.e.t.i. winners.

40:37.416 --> 40:39.317
Yeah! (laughs)
oh! yay!

40:39.401 --> 40:42.470
Oh, god.
you are the future
of publishing.

40:42.521 --> 40:46.024
And it's completely due
to your work.

40:46.108 --> 40:48.660
It has nothing to do
with anything extracurricular

40:48.744 --> 40:51.329
One of you may have done
last night.

40:51.413 --> 40:52.730
(clears throat)

40:52.815 --> 40:54.716
Matt, thank you.

40:54.767 --> 40:57.101
It wouldn't have happened
witht you.

40:57.186 --> 40:59.487
Well, we make a great team.

40:59.538 --> 41:03.724
So i am going to
a sing-along.

41:03.776 --> 41:07.261
(chuckles)
and, um, you know
that the men

41:07.313 --> 41:10.198
Who generally go
to sing-alongs are...

41:10.266 --> 41:12.166
A catch.

41:12.218 --> 41:15.186
I love sing-alongs.

41:16.755 --> 41:19.541
We certainly have
a lot in common.

41:19.608 --> 41:22.577
(chuckles)

41:22.628 --> 41:25.379
You are putting
