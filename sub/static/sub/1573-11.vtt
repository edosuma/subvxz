<b>6x11 - "Voices" </b>

00:23.258 --> 00:24.967
<i>Jedi mystery!</i>

00:25.009 --> 00:28.555
<i>A lightsaber was found
on the moon of Oba Diah,</i>

00:28.597 --> 00:30.223
<i>belonging to Sifo-Dyas,</i>

00:30.265 --> 00:34.561
<i>a Jedi responsible for
the creation of the clone army.</i>

00:34.603 --> 00:37.397
<i>The Jedi have learned
that before the start of the war</i>

00:37.439 --> 00:39.608
<i>Count Dooku murdered Sifo-Dyas</i>

00:39.649 --> 00:42.485
<i>and skillfully manipulated
the Republic</i>

00:42.527 --> 00:44.279
<i>into the galactic conflict,</i>

00:44.320 --> 00:48.742
<i>intending for the Jedi to fight
with the clones at their side.</i>

00:48.784 --> 00:50.577
<i>Now as the Jedi Council meets</i>

00:50.619 --> 00:52.454
<i>to discuss the purpose
of this deception,</i>

00:52.495 --> 00:55.624
<i>Master Yoda meditates
deep into the Force</i>

00:55.665 --> 00:57.959
<i>in search of answers.</i>

01:03.172 --> 01:04.882
<i>Yoda...</i>

01:04.925 --> 01:08.344
Hear you I do.

01:08.386 --> 01:11.389
Who are you?

01:11.431 --> 01:14.100
My imagination it must be.

01:14.142 --> 01:19.871
<i>No.
It is I, Qui-Gon Jinn.</i>

01:19.898 --> 01:23.443
That cannot be.
Dead you are.

01:23.485 --> 01:27.113
<i>No.
I am part of the Living Force, Yoda.</i>

01:38.291 --> 01:39.835
Impossible.

01:43.630 --> 01:45.882
I am not sure this Council is admitting

01:45.924 --> 01:48.259
how grave a situation we are in.

01:48.301 --> 01:49.845
What are you saying?

01:49.886 --> 01:53.640
That Dooku is not the Sith Lord;
merely an apprentice.

01:53.682 --> 01:57.477
That, like many things,
remains unclear.

01:57.519 --> 02:01.982
Master Yoda, your thoughts
on these revelations?

02:02.023 --> 02:06.277
Hmm?
Oh, oh, yes, yes.

02:06.319 --> 02:08.989
Forgive me,
deep in thought I was.

02:13.910 --> 02:15.912
You were saying?

02:15.954 --> 02:19.374
Master Ki-Adi-Mundi
is worried.

02:19.415 --> 02:22.878
Yes, worried we all should be.

02:22.919 --> 02:25.213
Lies and mistrust surround us
in the Senate,

02:25.254 --> 02:29.634
and perhaps even within these walls.

02:29.676 --> 02:30.760
Hmm.

02:30.802 --> 02:34.305
On the precipice we are, yes.

02:34.347 --> 02:38.768
The growing dark side
endangers us all.

02:42.981 --> 02:44.399
Excuse me, everyone.

02:44.440 --> 02:47.610
Master Kenobi,
may I speak with you in private?

02:47.652 --> 02:49.153
Of course.

02:58.914 --> 03:01.875
There is great turmoil
within Master Yoda.

03:01.917 --> 03:04.210
Yes, we all sensed it.

03:04.252 --> 03:08.214
For something to affect Yoda
this deeply concerns me.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.967
We must keep an eye on our old friend.

03:11.009 --> 03:14.345
The war has taxed all of us
to our limit.

03:14.387 --> 03:17.306
I suppose we're just surprised
that Master Yoda has one.

03:17.348 --> 03:19.726
I hope it's that simple,

03:19.768 --> 03:22.687
but I feel the shadow
of something greater

03:22.729 --> 03:24.731
on our horizon.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.121
<i>Yoda.</i>

03:44.918 --> 03:45.877
Oh!

03:45.919 --> 03:47.128
Master Yoda.

03:47.169 --> 03:49.338
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

03:49.380 --> 03:51.967
Is everything okay?

03:52.008 --> 03:55.595
Encountered something...
difficult, I have.

03:55.637 --> 03:58.640
Difficult?
For you, Master?

03:58.681 --> 04:03.144
Spoke with Master Qui-Gon Jinn
on Mortis did you not?

04:03.185 --> 04:04.938
Yes...

04:04.980 --> 04:06.314
So did Obi-Wan.

04:06.355 --> 04:07.732
However, since he's dead,

04:07.774 --> 04:10.151
we don't think it was actually him.

04:10.192 --> 04:11.903
Rather an illusion...

04:11.945 --> 04:15.031
A mind trick formed out
of our memories.

04:15.073 --> 04:17.700
That's what Obi-Wan believes...

04:17.742 --> 04:19.368
Why do you ask?

04:19.410 --> 04:21.829
Perhaps nothing it is.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.706
Everything that we know about
the Force

04:23.748 --> 04:25.166
tells us that an individual

04:25.207 --> 04:28.962
retaining their identity
after death is impossible.

04:29.004 --> 04:31.422
Everything that we know, yes.

04:31.464 --> 04:33.925
But what about what we know not?

04:33.967 --> 04:35.802
Hmm?

04:35.844 --> 04:37.846
Master Yoda, are you suggesting

04:37.887 --> 04:40.640
that you have spoken
with Master Qui-Gon?

04:40.682 --> 04:42.892
Suggest this I am not.

04:42.934 --> 04:47.229
Rest I need.
Yes, rest.

04:47.271 --> 04:49.816
Then speak with the Council I shall.

04:54.612 --> 04:58.240
Sense something
that I have not before.

04:58.282 --> 05:00.076
Impossible it seems.

05:00.118 --> 05:03.997
Trust my feelings, I do not.

05:04.039 --> 05:06.749
The voice I hear
does not come from within

05:06.791 --> 05:10.045
but speaks from beyond.

05:10.086 --> 05:12.296
Know I must if I am alone,

05:12.338 --> 05:15.257
or if any of you can hear it as well.

05:15.299 --> 05:19.303
Then together we shall meditate.

05:57.425 --> 06:01.345
Hmm.
Hear the voice I did not.

06:03.848 --> 06:07.393
I also sensed nothing.

06:07.435 --> 06:10.146
Answers we will not find.

06:10.188 --> 06:12.314
Tired I am.

06:12.356 --> 06:14.192
Rest I must.

06:14.234 --> 06:18.320
We have to consider that this
may be a deception by the Sith.

06:18.362 --> 06:20.240
Surely you're not suggesting

06:20.280 --> 06:23.952
Master Yoda is susceptible
to such manipulation.

06:23.993 --> 06:25.494
Master Yoda,

06:25.536 --> 06:29.207
you are older
and wiser than any living Jedi,

06:29.249 --> 06:31.793
but this does not mean
you are beyond the corruption

06:31.834 --> 06:33.669
of the dark side.

06:33.711 --> 06:35.337
Agree I do.

06:35.379 --> 06:38.424
A possibility we must consider it is.

06:38.466 --> 06:42.095
Clouded so much of our vision
the dark side has,

06:42.137 --> 06:45.807
deceived I may be.

06:57.860 --> 06:59.654
All I can tell you is,

06:59.695 --> 07:01.156
I have scanned Master Yoda
three times

07:01.197 --> 07:03.241
and I find nothing wrong with him.

07:03.283 --> 07:05.409
I am not an expert on his biology,

07:05.451 --> 07:09.497
but from my point of view,
he is in perfect health.

07:09.538 --> 07:11.624
And his mind?

07:11.666 --> 07:14.877
No signs of any degeneration.

07:14.919 --> 07:18.840
This section of the brain
is particularly active,

07:18.881 --> 07:21.509
more than I have seen
in any other Jedi.

07:21.550 --> 07:24.762
Probably what happens
when you approach 900 years old.

07:24.804 --> 07:27.556
I think we are overlooking
an obvious thread.

07:27.598 --> 07:29.475
Which is...

07:29.517 --> 07:31.644
Count Dooku was Yoda's apprentice,

07:31.686 --> 07:34.647
and Count Dooku has fallen
to the dark side.

07:34.689 --> 07:37.233
All of us have apprenticed
to Master Yoda.

07:37.275 --> 07:40.195
He cannot be held accountable
for Dooku's descent.

07:40.236 --> 07:43.114
But they are connected, profoundly.

07:43.156 --> 07:44.699
Whoever the Sith Lord is,

07:44.740 --> 07:46.659
he may be using this relationship

07:46.701 --> 07:48.452
as a direct link to Yoda.

07:48.494 --> 07:49.662
Impossible.

07:49.704 --> 07:51.413
Are you so sure?

07:51.455 --> 07:53.124
If the Sith Lord wanted to attack

07:53.166 --> 07:55.084
the Jedi Order from within,

07:55.126 --> 07:58.087
Master Yoda would be
the perfect choice.

07:58.129 --> 08:02.091
I fear we are more vulnerable
than we think.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.593
I would like
to suggest something:

08:04.635 --> 08:06.721
a deprivation ritual.

08:06.762 --> 08:07.930
It is a dangerous procedure

08:07.972 --> 08:09.515
but one that will without question

08:09.557 --> 08:12.560
allow Yoda to go to the source
of this voice...

08:12.601 --> 08:15.521
whatever, whoever it may be.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.856
I'm sorry to bother you,

08:16.898 --> 08:18.316
but the Chancellor's requesting

08:18.358 --> 08:20.943
that Master Yoda attend
an emergency meeting.

08:20.985 --> 08:22.695
I will go.

08:22.737 --> 08:24.239
What about the treatment?

08:24.280 --> 08:26.657
Ask Master Yoda what he wants to do.

08:26.699 --> 08:29.869
Only he can decide now.

08:40.629 --> 08:42.590
The chamber works
to deprive the patient

08:42.631 --> 08:45.218
of any stimulation except from within.

08:45.260 --> 08:49.013
Master Yoda will be taken
into an induced meditation.

08:49.055 --> 08:51.391
This allows the patient
to go deeper than anything

08:51.432 --> 08:53.309
we can achieve by ourselves.

08:53.351 --> 08:56.645
Master Yoda, you don't have to do this.

08:56.687 --> 08:59.023
Solve this puzzle I will.

08:59.065 --> 09:01.734
But it could be more dangerous
than you realize.

09:01.776 --> 09:04.362
The danger is not to know the truth.

09:04.404 --> 09:07.365
See clearly I must.

09:07.407 --> 09:09.742
Help this will.

09:18.626 --> 09:21.003
Life signs are normal.

09:21.045 --> 09:22.964
Beginning the procedure...

09:42.775 --> 09:44.277
What are you doing?

09:44.319 --> 09:46.279
By reducing the flow of oxygen,

09:46.321 --> 09:49.157
the body will be forced into
a deep meditative state.

09:49.198 --> 09:52.368
It will take him as close
to death as possible.

09:52.410 --> 09:53.828
I don't like this.

09:55.913 --> 09:59.459
<i> Yoda.
No, this is not the way.</i>

10:03.004 --> 10:04.964
<i>Come to Dagobah.</i>

10:05.006 --> 10:07.758
<i>The answers you seek are here.</i>

10:09.344 --> 10:11.095
But why?

10:11.137 --> 10:13.348
<i>You must complete what I could not.</i>

10:13.389 --> 10:15.350
His vital signs are dropping too low.

10:15.391 --> 10:18.853
- But the test.
- I want him out of there now!

10:18.894 --> 10:20.646
Master Yoda!

10:20.688 --> 10:24.650
<i>Master Yoda, wake up!
Come back to us!</i>

10:24.692 --> 10:27.778
<i>Speak of this to no one.
 Trust no one.</i>

10:27.820 --> 10:30.114
<i>Come to Dagobah alone.</i>

10:31.449 --> 10:35.203
<i>Master Yoda.
Master Yoda, wake up!</i>

10:39.874 --> 10:41.709
Welcome back, old friend.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.294
Thought we lost you there.

10:44.545 --> 10:49.509
Speaking to the dead I was,
friends long gone.

10:49.550 --> 10:51.593
Good friends.

10:54.889 --> 10:56.682
How did the procedure go?

10:56.724 --> 10:58.142
We're not certain.

10:58.184 --> 10:59.810
Yoda seems to be under the impression

10:59.852 --> 11:04.606
he contacted the dead
and spoke with them.

11:04.648 --> 11:06.484
What are your thoughts
on this, Doctor?

11:06.526 --> 11:08.110
Medically Yoda seems fine,

11:08.152 --> 11:11.613
but I cannot speak
to his spiritual balance.

11:11.655 --> 11:14.450
What Yoda claims is not possible.

11:14.492 --> 11:17.078
As far as we know.

11:17.119 --> 11:19.455
The dead are part
of the Cosmic Force

11:19.497 --> 11:21.581
and lose their individuality.

11:21.623 --> 11:24.335
I fear Yoda is under attack
by the Sith,

11:24.377 --> 11:27.629
though how remains unknown
to us.

11:27.671 --> 11:29.924
Until what's going on is clear,

11:29.965 --> 11:33.511
I want temple guards placed
in the medical bay.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.106
I am prescribing nothing
but bed rest

11:45.147 --> 11:47.358
for you now, Master Yoda.

11:49.944 --> 11:52.154
I will leave you two alone.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.326
You asked for me, Master?

11:57.368 --> 11:58.536
Yes.

11:58.578 --> 12:00.079
Friends, we are?
Hmm?

12:00.121 --> 12:01.414
Of course.

12:01.456 --> 12:03.291
A choice you must make.

12:03.332 --> 12:05.042
Worried for you I am.

12:05.084 --> 12:06.335
Why is that?

12:06.377 --> 12:08.588
Do for me something you must.

12:08.628 --> 12:11.382
Blamed you will be.

12:11.424 --> 12:14.051
What?
What must I do?

12:14.093 --> 12:16.554
Help me to escape.
Yes.

12:16.596 --> 12:19.765
Escape?
But you're not in prison.

12:19.807 --> 12:23.352
No, perhaps,

12:23.394 --> 12:26.564
but perhaps I am.

12:26.606 --> 12:29.358
Already, all around us
the cage may be.

12:29.400 --> 12:33.070
A journey I must make alone.

12:33.112 --> 12:35.948
The Council will not want
you to travel at all,

12:35.990 --> 12:37.699
alone even less.

12:37.741 --> 12:41.120
Disobeying the Council
your expertise is.

12:41.162 --> 12:43.663
That is why I ask
for your help.

12:43.705 --> 12:46.125
It is the spontaneity you find so easily

12:46.167 --> 12:48.043
which others do not.

12:48.085 --> 12:50.588
That is what sets you apart.

12:50.630 --> 12:53.174
Now, a walk you will take me on.

12:53.215 --> 12:55.801
Come, come.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.429
Where are you going?

12:58.471 --> 13:01.723
Some fresh air I require.

13:01.765 --> 13:04.143
It's okay.
He's with me.

13:04.185 --> 13:05.186
I'll watch him.

13:09.524 --> 13:12.026
I hope I don't regret this.

13:23.037 --> 13:25.665
Hey, Artoo,
I have a mission for you.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.458
Doctor Nema is gonna notice
Yoda is missing

13:27.500 --> 13:28.876
any minute now.

13:28.917 --> 13:31.920
Get him to his ship as fast as
possible and get him out of here.

13:50.398 --> 13:53.359
Where's Master Yoda?
What have you done?

13:53.401 --> 13:55.986
Hey, for once,
none of this was my idea.

14:50.332 --> 14:53.586
Yes, stay with the ship you may.

14:53.628 --> 14:57.005
This task, for me alone it is.

15:20.529 --> 15:22.239
Here I am.

15:22.281 --> 15:25.660
Ready for my next instruction,
Master Qui-Gon.

15:29.079 --> 15:33.626
<i> Yoda, my old friend,
you have come at last.</i>

15:33.668 --> 15:36.962
Qui-Gon Jinn.
Really you, it is?

15:37.004 --> 15:38.297
<i>It is.</i>

15:38.339 --> 15:40.675
Losing my mind I am not?

15:40.716 --> 15:43.302
<i> No, my friend. No.</i>

15:43.344 --> 15:45.680
Why have you brought me here?

15:45.721 --> 15:47.973
<i>Follow the light.</i>

15:48.015 --> 15:50.309
<i>The light will be your guide.</i>

16:10.579 --> 16:13.165
Strong this planet is
with the Force.

16:13.207 --> 16:16.794
<i>It is one of the purest
places in the galaxy.</i>

16:22.299 --> 16:24.134
How are you here?

16:24.176 --> 16:26.846
<i>I am a manifestation of the Force,</i>

16:26.887 --> 16:30.265
<i>a Force that consists of two parts.</i>

16:30.307 --> 16:33.018
<i>Living beings generate
the Living Force,</i>

16:33.060 --> 16:36.313
<i>which in turn powers the
wellspring that is the Cosmic Force.</i>

16:44.530 --> 16:47.074
Show yourself, can you?

16:47.115 --> 16:50.745
<i> I cannot.
My training was incomplete.</i>

16:50.786 --> 16:53.455
<i>All energy from the Living Force...</i>

16:53.497 --> 16:55.875
<i>from all things that have ever lived,</i>

16:55.916 --> 16:58.210
<i>feeds into the Cosmic Force,</i>

16:58.252 --> 17:00.838
<i>binding everything
and communicating to us</i>

17:00.880 --> 17:03.131
<i>through the midi-chlorians.</i>

17:03.173 --> 17:06.343
<i>Because of this
I can speak to you now.</i>

17:06.385 --> 17:08.887
See the future, you can?

17:08.929 --> 17:13.392
<i> I exist where
there is no future or past.</i>

17:13.434 --> 17:17.020
Know you who the Sith Lord is?

17:17.061 --> 17:18.646
<i>I can only show you a place</i>

17:18.689 --> 17:21.400
<i>where the answers
will be revealed to you.</i>

17:43.714 --> 17:45.716
<i>Be wary.</i>

17:45.758 --> 17:48.302
<i>Give power to that which you fear,</i>

17:48.343 --> 17:50.554
<i>and it will show itself to you.</i>

18:32.638 --> 18:34.640
No!

18:41.522 --> 18:44.107
No.
No.

18:44.149 --> 18:48.779
You will die.

18:48.821 --> 18:50.781
Sidious.

18:53.826 --> 18:56.036
Sidious.

18:56.077 --> 18:58.121
Sidious.

18:59.289 --> 19:00.749
Join me.

19:00.791 --> 19:05.212
There is no other way.

19:05.253 --> 19:07.756
No.

19:07.798 --> 19:08.799
No!

19:35.784 --> 19:38.662
<i>Yoda.
Come back to us.</i>

19:38.704 --> 19:40.539
<i>Yoda.</i>

19:46.045 --> 19:48.088
Such darkness.

19:48.129 --> 19:51.425
Such evil.

19:51.466 --> 19:53.552
When will this happen?

19:53.594 --> 19:55.721
<i>It is happening right now.</i>

19:55.763 --> 19:57.765
<i>It has always been happening.</i>

19:57.806 --> 19:59.934
<i>With each day the Clone War wages,</i>

19:59.975 --> 20:02.519
<i>evil is growing in its power.</i>

20:02.561 --> 20:04.271
<i>What you felt in the cave</i>

20:04.312 --> 20:08.275
<i>is merely a portion of
what the dark side now holds.</i>

20:08.316 --> 20:10.736
Such power.

20:10.778 --> 20:14.531
Any hope that the Jedi
can prevail is there?

20:14.573 --> 20:17.076
<i>There is always hope, my friend,</i>

20:17.117 --> 20:20.370
<i>though it often comes in forms
not looked for.</i>

20:20.412 --> 20:22.330
<i>The key is knowing how to see it</i>

20:22.372 --> 20:24.917
<i>and seizing that opportunity.</i>

20:24.959 --> 20:27.836
<i>I have been tasked
with guiding you forward.</i>

20:33.801 --> 20:36.053
<i>There can be many outcomes,</i>

20:36.095 --> 20:38.346
<i>but your path is clear, Yoda.</i>

20:38.388 --> 20:42.476
<i>You have been chosen,
as I was before you.</i>

20:42.517 --> 20:44.853
For what chosen am I?

20:44.895 --> 20:47.606
<i>You will learn
to preserve your Life Force,</i>

20:47.648 --> 20:49.942
<i>and so, manifest a consciousness</i>

20:49.984 --> 20:52.694
<i>which will allow you
to commune with the living</i>

20:52.736 --> 20:55.864
<i>after death.</i>

20:55.906 --> 20:57.324
How?

20:57.365 --> 20:59.076
<i>Dark times are ahead,</i>

20:59.118 --> 21:02.203
<i>and forces of light must remain.</i>

21:02.245 --> 21:06.000
<i>This is the path of only a few Jedi.</i>

21:06.041 --> 21:10.671
<i>You will travel to one of the
origins of all life in the galaxy.</i>

21:10.712 --> 21:13.214
This place is where?

21:13.256 --> 21:16.093
<i>The Force will be your guide.</i>

21:18.553 --> 21:20.514
<i>Good-bye, my friend.</i>

21:26.103 --> 21:28.981
Yes, my friend.
All right I am.

21:30.524 --> 21:34.903
No, back to Coruscant
we are not going yet.

21:36.363 --> 21:40.784
Afraid only begun
our long journey has.
