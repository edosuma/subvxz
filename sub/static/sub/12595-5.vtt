00:03.937 --> 00:06.206
<b> <i>eight new and veteran artists</i> </b>

<b> <i>In the flash challenge,</i> </b>
<b> <i>rival alliances vied for power.</i> </b>

00:15.549 --> 00:17.284
<b>- How come you shaped it</b>
<b>like a heart?</b>

00:17.384 --> 00:19.520
<b> <i>- I've started an alliance with</i> </b>
<b> <i>two of the strongest players.</i> </b>

00:19.620 --> 00:22.222
<b>If I can't get this skull pick,</b>
<b>hopefully, one of them will.</b>

00:22.322 --> 00:25.893
<b>- The winner of the flash</b>

00:25.993 --> 00:26.994
<b>[together]</b> <b>Oh.</b>

00:27.094 --> 00:28.295
<b>- Now it's payback.</b>

00:28.395 --> 00:29.663
<b>- So if you have your eyes</b>
<b>on anybody,</b>

00:29.763 --> 00:30.763
<b>who would you choose?</b>

00:30.797 --> 00:32.866
<b>- I'd say Christian.</b>

00:32.966 --> 00:34.168
<b>- If you take out</b>
<b>the heart of the lion...</b>

00:34.268 --> 00:35.569
<b>- Cut off the head,</b>
<b>and they'll fall.</b>

00:35.669 --> 00:38.739
<b>- I think it's time we take</b>
<b>some of these rookies out.</b>

00:38.839 --> 00:42.309
<b> <i>announcer: In the elimination</b>
<b>tattoo, Matti Hixson returned.</i> </b>

00:42.409 --> 00:45.045
<b>- Ooh!</b>
<b>- I thought I smelled sausage.</b>

00:45.145 --> 00:46.947
<b> <i>announcer: And the veterans</b>
<b>were determined</i> </b>

00:47.047 --> 00:49.850
<b> <i>to turn the tables</i> </b>
<b> <i>on the new artists.</i> </b>

00:51.451 --> 00:53.091
<b>- I got the guy</b>
<b>who wanted a redwood tree,</b>

00:53.120 --> 00:53.787
<b>a mask, and a flower.</b>

00:53.887 --> 00:55.522
<b> <i>I hate this challenge.</i> </b>

00:55.622 --> 00:57.291
<b>Detail, detail.</b>

00:57.391 --> 00:59.193
<b>I hope I put enough in.</b>

00:59.293 --> 01:00.727
<b>- Alex just bitches and bitches.</b>

01:00.827 --> 01:02.062
<b>I can't take it anymore.</b>

01:02.162 --> 01:04.897
<b>I just want this little dick</b>
<b>to go home tonight.</b>

01:05.065 --> 01:06.567
<b>- Shut the [bleep] up,</b>
<b>you douchebag.</b>

01:06.667 --> 01:08.235
<b>- A lack of disrespect.</b>
<b>- A lack of [bleep].</b>

01:08.335 --> 01:09.536
<b>I'll [bleep] knock</b>
<b>your fat ass out, bitch.</b>

01:09.636 --> 01:13.473
<b>- A lack of disrespect.</b>
<b>- What's up, mother[bleep]?</b>

01:13.574 --> 01:17.077
<b> <i>announcer: In the elimination,</b>
<b>Alex, Megan,</i> </b>

01:17.177 --> 01:19.680
<b> <i>Anthony, and Picasso</i> </b>

01:19.780 --> 01:21.882

<b> <i>- Nobody can tell</i> </b>

01:23.350 --> 01:24.718
<b> <i>with this tattoo.</i> </b>

01:24.818 --> 01:25.953
<b>- Alex.</b>

01:26.086 --> 01:28.188
<b> <i>- What this lacks</i> </b>
<b> <i>is artistic flow.</i> </b>

01:28.288 --> 01:29.456
<b>It's very cut and paste.</b>

01:29.556 --> 01:31.525
<b>- Anthony.</b>

01:31.625 --> 01:33.465
<b> <i>- Realistically,</i> </b>
<b> <i>your tattoo is one of the ones</i> </b>

01:33.493 --> 01:35.128
<b>that has the least amount</b>
<b>of detail.</b>

01:35.229 --> 01:36.496
<b>- Picasso.</b>

01:36.597 --> 01:37.664
<b> <i>- Whether we like the artwork</i> </b>
<b> <i>or we don't,</i> </b>

01:37.764 --> 01:40.200

<b> <i>that smooth execution.</i> </b>

<b> <i>See that left hook</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the horn on the top?</i> </b>

01:43.303 --> 01:44.438
<b> <i>There's, like,</i> </b>
<b> <i>a thousand pickups.</i> </b>

01:44.538 --> 01:46.340
<b>- I feel like this is</b>
<b>the best one I've done.</b>

01:46.440 --> 01:49.376
<b>- Picasso, you do not have what</b>
<b>it takes to be an Ink Master.</b>

03:28.242 --> 03:29.676

04:01.508 --> 04:03.377
<b>we return</b>
<b>to the legendary Coney Island.</b>

04:03.477 --> 04:07.414
<b> <i>Since the Coney Island</i> </b>
<b> <i>Freak Show opened in 1880,</i> </b>

04:07.514 --> 04:10.384
<b> <i>contortionists have been one</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the most popular acts,</i> </b>

04:10.484 --> 04:13.687
<b>and this week they'll also</b>

04:15.055 --> 04:16.290
<b>Let's meet them.</b>

04:20.726 --> 04:21.661
<b>- They're ripped as [bleep].</b>

04:21.762 --> 04:23.664
<b>Any challenge</b>
<b>with half-naked women</b>

04:23.764 --> 04:25.299
<b>is an awesome challenge with me.</b>

04:25.399 --> 04:27.968
<b>- Contortionists combine art</b>
<b>and science</b>

04:28.068 --> 04:29.203
<b>by bending their bodies</b>

04:29.303 --> 04:32.072
<b>into creative</b>
<b>and sometimes shocking shapes.</b>

04:32.105 --> 04:36.076
<b>Today you must once again</b>
<b>work in teams of two.</b>

04:36.143 --> 04:37.845
<b>Each team</b>
<b>will be randomly assigned</b>

04:37.945 --> 04:39.780
<b>a pair of contortionists.</b>

04:39.880 --> 04:40.914
<b>You must first</b>
<b>pose your canvases,</b>

04:41.081 --> 04:42.983
<b>and then use body paint</b>

04:43.083 --> 04:46.353
<b>to transform them</b>
<b>into something else completely.</b>

04:46.453 --> 04:50.490
<b>This week you are being</b>
<b>judged on color theory.</b>

04:51.692 --> 04:53.126
<b>- Color theory</b>
<b>is taking different colors</b>

04:53.227 --> 04:56.129
<b>and making</b>
<b>them complement each other</b>

04:56.230 --> 04:57.197
<b> <i>so that in the end</i> </b>
<b> <i>they look great.</i> </b>

04:57.297 --> 05:00.100
<b>- You must use</b>
<b>a dynamic color palette</b>

05:00.200 --> 05:02.269
<b>to distract and direct the eye,</b>

05:02.369 --> 05:04.905
<b>creating</b>
<b>a mind-blowing illusion.</b>

05:07.374 --> 05:10.143
<b>Cleen, you won</b>
<b>the last elimination tattoo.</b>

05:10.244 --> 05:12.513
<b>That means you get</b>
<b>to assign the teams.</b>

05:12.613 --> 05:15.148
<b>Advantages</b>
<b>are few and far between,</b>

05:15.249 --> 05:16.409
<b>so make the most of this one.</b>

05:19.887 --> 05:21.722
<b>- The only one I'm trying</b>
<b>to help right now is myself.</b>

05:21.822 --> 05:24.825
<b> <i>I'm gonna try and screw over</i> </b>
<b> <i>as many of these guys</i> </b>

05:24.925 --> 05:26.165
<b> <i>as I possibly can, 'cause I need</i> </b>

05:26.226 --> 05:27.794
<b> <i>all the advantage I can get.</i> </b>

05:27.895 --> 05:30.631
<b> <i>- Cleen's headstrong, man,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and I know he's here to win.</i> </b>

05:30.731 --> 05:32.065

<b>of those skulls</b>

<b>please read the number</b>

05:35.636 --> 05:38.105
<b>on the bottom of your skull</b>
<b>to determine your team.</b>

05:38.205 --> 05:39.640
<b>- One.</b>

05:39.740 --> 05:41.775
<b>- Four.</b>

05:41.875 --> 05:44.311
<b>- One.</b>

05:44.411 --> 05:45.078
<b> <i>- Cleen chose me</i> </b>

05:47.114 --> 05:48.515
<b>Winner, winner, chicken dinner.</b>

05:48.615 --> 05:51.385
<b>- Team three.</b>
<b>- Three.</b>

05:51.485 --> 05:52.885
<b> <i>- I'm pairing up Megan</i> </b>
<b> <i>with Sausage,</i> </b>

05:52.953 --> 05:54.421

05:54.521 --> 05:55.756
<b>He's a good artist.</b>

05:55.856 --> 05:58.625
<b>If I paired Megan up</b>
<b>with Alex, she would kill me.</b>

05:59.493 --> 06:00.160

06:00.260 --> 06:02.796
<b> <i>- Alex, really, Cleen?</i> </b>

06:02.896 --> 06:04.598
<b>This guy has checked</b>

06:04.698 --> 06:07.367
<b>- Number two.</b>
<b>- Two.</b>

06:07.467 --> 06:09.903
<b> <i>- This could be</i> </b>

06:10.037 --> 06:12.372
<b>Anthony and I both primarily</b>

06:13.807 --> 06:17.611
<b>It's one of the first</b>
<b>smart moves Cleen's made.</b>

06:17.711 --> 06:19.111
<b>- The winners</b>
<b>of the flash challenge</b>

06:19.146 --> 06:21.849
<b>will have the power</b>
<b>to assign all human canvases</b>

06:21.949 --> 06:24.284

06:24.384 --> 06:26.186

06:38.065 --> 06:40.505
<b>- That would be freaking awesome</b>
<b>if I knew what to do with it.</b>

06:40.534 --> 06:42.014
<b> <i>- First of all,</i> </b>
<b> <i>you have to figure out</i> </b>

06:42.069 --> 06:43.403
<b> <i>how to position</i> </b>
<b> <i>these contortionists.</i> </b>

06:43.504 --> 06:43.904

06:44.071 --> 06:45.939
<b>- Stable.</b>

06:46.073 --> 06:47.207
<b> <i>- Second of all,</i> </b>
<b> <i>they have to disguise</i> </b>

06:49.610 --> 06:51.378

06:52.880 --> 06:56.116
<b>- Not only are we dealing</b>
<b>with weird-ass contortionists...</b>

06:56.216 --> 06:58.218
<b>- That's a little better.</b>
<b>- What could it be?</b>

06:58.318 --> 06:59.419
<b>But I've never, ever</b>
<b>airbrushed before in my life.</b>

06:59.520 --> 07:02.656

07:02.756 --> 07:04.358
<b>What do you think about</b>
<b>the idea of a snake?</b>

07:04.458 --> 07:06.126
<b>What about an Adam</b>

07:06.226 --> 07:08.295
<b>Oh, dude, her boobs as an eye?</b>

07:08.395 --> 07:08.896
<b>Is that a ship?</b>

07:09.029 --> 07:11.031
<b>- As an eye?</b>

07:11.098 --> 07:12.766
<b>We are talking way too much</b>
<b>and losing valuable time.</b>

07:12.866 --> 07:15.702
<b>- That's an awful little head</b>
<b>for a great big swan, brother.</b>

07:15.802 --> 07:19.039
<b>- If we don't win this challenge</b>
<b>and get a skull pick,</b>

07:19.072 --> 07:21.608
<b>I don't see us turning the tide</b>
<b>at all in our favor.</b>

07:21.708 --> 07:24.578
<b>- I'm just at a [bleep]</b>
<b>loss here on this one.</b>

07:25.646 --> 07:27.281
<b>- We can do, like,</b>
<b>an alligator head.</b>

07:27.381 --> 07:28.615
<b>I was thinking, like, a swan.</b>

07:28.715 --> 07:31.718
<b>- Every idea falling out</b>
<b>of Alex's mouth right now</b>

07:31.818 --> 07:32.653
<b>is absolutely horse [bleep].</b>

07:32.753 --> 07:34.421
<b>We should try to do</b>
<b>like a macaw.</b>

07:34.521 --> 07:37.090
<b>- I have no idea</b>
<b>what that bird looks like.</b>

07:37.191 --> 07:38.058
<b>- Oh, it's fine.</b> <b>I got it.</b>

07:38.158 --> 07:39.426
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- Don't worry about it.</b>

07:39.526 --> 07:41.126
<b>I have to take the lead</b>
<b>in this challenge</b>

07:41.195 --> 07:43.430
<b>because Alex doesn't have</b>
<b>anything to bring.</b>

07:43.530 --> 07:45.065
<b>This is the one, dude.</b>
<b>This is the winner.</b>

07:45.098 --> 07:45.933
<b>If we get that skull pick,</b>
<b>we could [bleep]</b>

07:46.066 --> 07:48.435
<b>totally take over.</b>

07:48.535 --> 07:52.339
<b>I've got 99 problems,</b>
<b>and they're all Alex.</b>

07:52.439 --> 07:54.174
<b>- I'm imagining it's like</b>
<b>some body styles,</b>

07:54.274 --> 07:55.554
<b>like, say, like,</b>
<b>she's bent over.</b>

07:55.642 --> 07:57.544
<b>- Yeah, yeah.</b>
<b>- Her head's here.</b>

07:57.644 --> 07:58.912
<b>I started to get some sort of,</b>
<b>like, a clown face.</b>

07:59.079 --> 08:00.514
<b>- The clown idea is [bleep]</b>
<b>killer.</b>

08:00.614 --> 08:01.815
<b> <i>- We're at Coney Island.</i> </b>

08:01.915 --> 08:05.552
<b>A laughing clown</b>
<b>seems perfect subject matter.</b>

08:05.652 --> 08:08.355
<b>- We're gonna have our</b>
<b>contortionist actually twerk,</b>

08:08.455 --> 08:09.815
<b> <i>so it's gonna</i> </b>
<b> <i>make the clown laugh.</i> </b>

08:09.890 --> 08:12.292
<b>This is gonna be awesome.</b>

08:12.392 --> 08:13.727
<b>- I think, like,</b>

08:13.827 --> 08:16.063
<b>a spider would be, like,</b>
<b>a really badass...</b>

08:16.163 --> 08:18.131
<b>- Or what I'm thinking is,</b>
<b>like, one arch this way</b>

08:18.232 --> 08:19.333
<b>and one arch this way.</b>

08:19.433 --> 08:21.602
<b>Would that not give you</b>
<b>kind of a scorpion shape?</b>

08:21.702 --> 08:24.438
<b>- I need to see them</b>
<b>in their positions again.</b>

08:24.538 --> 08:26.406
<b>- That was a scorpion.</b>

08:26.507 --> 08:27.674
<b>- Yes.</b>

<b>makes this thing awesome.</b>

30:11.055 --> 30:12.623
<b>Christian.</b>

30:12.723 --> 30:13.691
<b>- Your color theory in this,</b>

30:13.791 --> 30:15.092
<b> <i>using that purplish and blue,</i> </b>

30:15.193 --> 30:17.261
<b> <i>and then coming off</i> </b>
<b> <i>with that hot yellow,</i> </b>

30:17.361 --> 30:20.765
<b>and then going back</b>
<b>to the green, it's a nice blend.</b>

30:20.865 --> 30:23.100
<b>You have the red which then</b>
<b>balances everything out.</b>

30:23.201 --> 30:24.335
<b> <i>Aesthetically it's pleasing.</i> </b>

30:24.435 --> 30:26.537
<b>It just doesn't knock new school</b>
<b>out of the park.</b>

30:29.040 --> 30:32.210
<b>- Megan Jean.</b>

30:32.310 --> 30:34.312
<b>- This tattoo's</b>
<b>definitely weird.</b>

30:34.412 --> 30:36.547
<b> <i>It's solid, it's bright,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but it's hard to read exactly</i> </b>

30:36.647 --> 30:38.950
<b>what's going on,</b>
<b>especially from a distance.</b>

30:39.050 --> 30:40.651
<b> <i>The perspective</i> </b>
<b> <i>you chose is weird,</i> </b>

30:40.751 --> 30:42.153
<b> <i>because you don't see</i> </b>
<b> <i>enough of the body</i> </b>

30:42.253 --> 30:43.154
<b> <i>to see what's going on.</i> </b>

30:43.254 --> 30:44.155
<b>It's just hard to read.</b>

30:44.255 --> 30:45.389
<b>- I wanted that perspective.</b>

30:45.490 --> 30:46.858
<b>I think it's tough</b>
<b>but interesting.</b>

30:46.958 --> 30:47.925
<b>- But if you look at depth,</b>

30:48.059 --> 30:49.393
<b>and the richness, and the punch</b>

30:49.494 --> 30:50.661
<b>that some of the other tattoos</b>
<b>in the room have,</b>

30:50.761 --> 30:54.866
<b>you really missed it.</b>

30:54.966 --> 30:58.503
<b>- Anthony.</b>

30:58.603 --> 30:59.904
<b>I like this tattoo.</b>

31:00.004 --> 31:01.539
<b> <i>It's a weird thing</i> </b>
<b> <i>that she asked for,</i> </b>

31:01.639 --> 31:05.042
<b> <i>purple dinosaur that's</i> </b>
<b> <i>a unicorn blowing bubbles,</i> </b>

31:05.143 --> 31:06.777
<b>yet I know what it is.</b>

31:06.878 --> 31:10.515
<b> <i>This is legible and readable,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and it's a solid job, man.</i> </b>

31:10.615 --> 31:13.818
<b>- Because you stuck to doing</b>
<b>one thickness of an outline,</b>

31:13.918 --> 31:15.286
<b> <i>the tattoo looks very clean,</i> </b>

31:15.386 --> 31:17.788
<b>and in the end it's a really</b>
<b>nicely wearable tattoo.</b>

31:20.625 --> 31:22.827
<b>- Alex.</b>

31:22.927 --> 31:24.362
<b>- What's going on with the color</b>

31:24.462 --> 31:26.197
<b> <i>that you kind of split</i> </b>
<b> <i>this guy in half?</i> </b>

31:26.297 --> 31:28.257
<b>- Just a hard light source</b>
<b>on the back side of it.</b>

31:28.299 --> 31:30.701
<b>- It's a little bit weird.</b>
<b>Huge head. Weird little body.</b>

31:30.802 --> 31:32.537
<b> <i>Oh, is that a surfboard</i> </b>
<b> <i>down there; Maybe it is.</i> </b>

31:32.637 --> 31:34.077
<b>- There's a lot</b>
<b>of missed opportunity</b>

31:34.138 --> 31:34.872
<b> <i>in the water and the background.</i> </b>

31:35.039 --> 31:36.040
<b> <i>You fall flat on drawing.</i> </b>

31:36.107 --> 31:39.110
<b>For a guy who was</b>
<b>at the bottom last week,</b>

31:39.210 --> 31:41.245
<b>you need to be drawing</b>
<b>a lot harder and stronger.</b>

31:41.345 --> 31:43.114
<b>Do you still want to keep</b>
<b>pushing in this place or what?</b>

31:43.214 --> 31:44.816
<b>- Hell, yes, I wanna be here.</b>

31:44.916 --> 31:47.051
<b>This is it, man.</b>
<b>I want to be here.</b>

31:47.118 --> 31:48.519
<b>- That drawing's</b>
<b>got to reflect it.</b>

31:48.619 --> 31:50.655
<b>It's not about surviving.</b>
<b>It's about winning.</b>

31:52.623 --> 31:56.561
<b>- St. Marq.</b>

31:56.661 --> 31:58.162
<b> <i>- The color theory</i> </b>
<b> <i>on this tattoo,</i> </b>

31:58.262 --> 31:59.564
<b> <i>there's not a lot of wow factor.</i> </b>

31:59.664 --> 32:00.998
<b> <i>There's some areas of transition</i> </b>

32:01.065 --> 32:02.467
<b> <i>from one color to the next</i> </b>

32:02.567 --> 32:03.901
<b> <i>where it's just not really</i> </b>
<b> <i>super smooth and blendy.</i> </b>

32:04.001 --> 32:06.871
<b>- You just didn't capitalize on</b>
<b>the color theory of the day.</b>

32:07.004 --> 32:09.106
<b> <i>It is pretty weak and patchy</i> </b>
<b> <i>in a lot of areas</i> </b>

32:09.207 --> 32:11.742
<b> <i>where you really</i> </b>
<b> <i>needed to ramp up,</i> </b>

32:11.843 --> 32:12.910
<b>and you could have used black.</b>

32:13.010 --> 32:14.245
<b>It would have been</b>
<b>your friend in this.</b>

32:14.345 --> 32:15.680
<b>- I definitely did take it</b>
<b>a little easy on the black,</b>

32:15.780 --> 32:18.416
<b> <i>because I was worried that I</i> </b>
<b> <i>was gonna muddy my color up,</i> </b>

32:18.516 --> 32:20.218
<b>and maybe that was</b>
<b>a gamble I lost.</b>

32:20.318 --> 32:22.019
<b>- Compared to the rest</b>
<b>of the room, a lot of people</b>

32:22.119 --> 32:23.387
<b>either know new school</b>

32:23.488 --> 32:25.356
<b>and really hit the new</b>
<b>school part of the challenge</b>

32:25.456 --> 32:27.425
<b>or did a lot of</b>
<b>really bright color saturation</b>

32:27.525 --> 32:28.860
<b>and showed a good color theory.</b>

32:29.026 --> 32:31.506
<b>I feel like you kind of missed</b>
<b>a little bit of both marks here.</b>

32:35.166 --> 32:36.100
<b>- All right, judges,</b>
<b>time to determine</b>

32:36.200 --> 32:39.036
<b>who had</b>
<b>the best tattoo of the day.</b>

32:39.070 --> 32:40.304
<b>- Just judging</b>
<b>on the challenge today,</b>

32:40.404 --> 32:43.641
<b>drawing, detail, new school,</b>
<b>color theory, everything,</b>

32:43.741 --> 32:46.410
<b>the best final product</b>
<b>is Sausage.</b>

32:46.511 --> 32:49.280
<b>- No, my vote's for Cleen.</b>
<b>It's just massive.</b>

32:49.380 --> 32:50.848
<b> <i>It has everything to it.</i> </b>

32:50.948 --> 32:52.717
<b>It's what Sausage did and more.</b>

32:54.252 --> 32:56.320
<b>- I like them both.</b>
<b>I like both applications.</b>

32:56.420 --> 32:58.623
<b> <i>I think Sausage had a little</i> </b>
<b> <i>bit more breathability,</i> </b>

32:58.723 --> 33:01.626
<b>which appeals to me,</b>
<b>so I vote for Sausage.</b>

33:01.726 --> 33:02.760
<b>The judges have decided.</b>

33:02.860 --> 33:05.630
<b>The best tattoo of the day</b>
<b>goes to Sausage.</b>

33:09.267 --> 33:11.803
<b>The human canvas jury</b>
<b>is deliberating right now,</b>

33:11.903 --> 33:15.106
<b>and their vote will put</b>
<b>one artist up for elimination.</b>

33:15.206 --> 33:16.407
<b>Head back to the loft.</b>

<b>One of you is about</b>
<b>to pack your machines.</b>

33:22.079 --> 33:24.115
<b>- I'm gonna fight to stay here.</b>

33:24.215 --> 33:25.183
<b>- You screwed</b>
<b>the pooch today, buddy.</b>

33:25.283 --> 33:27.251
<b>- I've been faced</b>
<b>with eight guys</b>

33:27.351 --> 33:29.520
<b>who have a singular vision</b>
<b>to [bleep] me.</b>

33:29.620 --> 33:33.024
<b>- Well, that's everybody.</b>
<b>I've gotten [bleep] canvases.</b>

33:33.090 --> 33:35.450
<b>- I mean, if the new artists</b>
<b>are able to take out a veteran,</b>

33:35.493 --> 33:36.694
<b>that'll be a feather</b>
<b>in their cap for sure.</b>

33:36.794 --> 33:39.363
<b>- And you're letting down</b>
<b>the veteran artists right now.</b>

33:39.464 --> 33:40.744
<b>- I definitely dropped the ball.</b>

33:40.832 --> 33:42.033
<b>- Yeah, I don't think</b>
<b>you dropped the ball.</b>

33:42.099 --> 33:43.401
<b>I don't think</b>
<b>you ever picked it up.</b>

33:43.501 --> 33:44.735
<b>- I don't want</b>
<b>to let you guys down.</b>

33:44.836 --> 33:47.338
<b>- If there's ever a time</b>
<b>to inflate your balls,</b>

33:47.438 --> 33:49.078

<b>today we're testing color theory</b>

33:58.571 --> 34:00.873
<b>with new-school dinosaurs.</b>

34:00.974 --> 34:02.275
<b>Alex did</b>
<b>a very new-school design</b>

34:02.375 --> 34:05.645
<b> <i>with great color theory here,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but very little detail.</i> </b>

34:05.745 --> 34:07.380
<b>It almost looks</b>

34:07.480 --> 34:08.815
<b> <i>- It's all just very flat.</i> </b>

34:08.915 --> 34:09.983
<b> <i>- His drawing</i> </b>
<b> <i>and St. Marq's drawing</i> </b>

34:10.083 --> 34:12.251
<b> <i>are two of</i> </b>
<b> <i>the worst drawings of the day.</i> </b>

34:12.351 --> 34:15.154
<b>- There's tons of discrepancies</b>
<b>in just the dark purple,</b>

34:15.254 --> 34:17.657
<b> <i>and this is</i> </b>
<b> <i>the weakest color palette.</i> </b>

34:17.757 --> 34:19.359
<b> <i>That belly is just not doing it.</i> </b>

34:19.458 --> 34:21.027
<b>- I think that Megan Jean</b>
<b>hit the challenge</b>

34:21.127 --> 34:22.161
<b>better than St. Marq.</b>

34:22.261 --> 34:24.163

<b> <i>is just so bland.</i> </b>

34:29.435 --> 34:30.103
<b>I'm not a fan</b>
<b>of her tattoo at all.</b>

34:30.203 --> 34:32.304
<b>- No.</b>

34:32.405 --> 34:33.406
<b>- Well, we never know which way</b>
<b>the human canvas jury</b>

34:34.474 --> 34:36.643

<b>- We're here to determine who</b>
<b>has the worst tattoo of the day.</b>

34:39.545 --> 34:41.748
<b>- This is my tattoo,</b>
<b>and Alex was my artist.</b>

34:41.848 --> 34:43.949
<b>- I'm like,</b>
<b>pregnant belly, wham.</b>

34:44.050 --> 34:46.619
<b>- I mean, he's even got</b>
<b>the little lines in there</b>

34:46.719 --> 34:48.054
<b>like it's got stretch marks.</b>

34:48.154 --> 34:49.922
<b>- The shading goes from, like,</b>
<b>yellow to green pretty hard.</b>

34:50.023 --> 34:52.659
<b>- I like all</b>
<b>the different colors in there.</b>

34:52.759 --> 34:53.826
<b>- It looks like</b>
<b>he's split in half.</b>

34:53.926 --> 34:54.994
<b>It could almost pass for a snake</b>

34:55.094 --> 34:56.228
<b>if you look at it quickly.</b>

34:56.329 --> 34:57.997
<b>It's a snake</b>
<b>that just ate a rat.</b>

34:58.097 --> 35:00.900
<b>- This is my tattoo,</b>
<b>and my artist was St. Marq.</b>

35:01.000 --> 35:02.969
<b>- What are the dots</b>
<b>up behind him supposed to be?</b>

35:03.069 --> 35:04.604
<b>- Gels for stage lighting.</b>

35:04.704 --> 35:06.839
<b>- To me, it looks like</b>
<b>it's brass knuckles up there.</b>

35:06.939 --> 35:08.441
<b>- I don't like the way</b>
<b>he's doing the peace sign.</b>

35:08.541 --> 35:10.343
<b>- That's not a peace sign.</b>
<b>That's a devil horns.</b>

35:10.443 --> 35:12.803
<b>You got to think, man, they</b>
<b>don't have five fingers like us.</b>

35:12.845 --> 35:14.125
<b>- And that orb</b>
<b>throws me off too.</b>

35:14.180 --> 35:15.148
<b>- That's supposed</b>
<b>to be a power button.</b>

35:15.248 --> 35:17.216
<b>- It doesn't seem like</b>
<b>it fits in at all.</b>

35:18.951 --> 35:20.887
<b>- That's my tattoo.</b>
<b>My artist was Christian.</b>

35:20.987 --> 35:22.188
<b>- I don't like the stance.</b>

35:22.288 --> 35:24.991
<b>I see a dinosaur hunchback</b>
<b>like it has scoliosis.</b>

35:25.091 --> 35:27.560
<b>- He's in position</b>
<b>to get ready to swing.</b>

35:27.627 --> 35:28.695
<b>- Well, I feel sorry for you,</b>

35:28.795 --> 35:30.630
<b>because that green background</b>
<b>is disgusting.</b>

35:30.730 --> 35:33.099
<b>It looks like your artist can't</b>
<b>even do any vibrant colors.</b>

35:33.199 --> 35:34.600
<b>St. Marq at least attempted it.</b>

35:34.701 --> 35:36.436
<b>- Mine looks totally way better.</b>

35:36.569 --> 35:38.271
<b>- Come on, man,</b>
<b>it's all just stiff and rigid.</b>

35:38.371 --> 35:42.275
<b>Mine at least has chill</b>
<b>bone under the crown.</b>

35:43.943 --> 35:45.211
<b>I'd be pretty worried</b>

35:45.311 --> 35:46.379

<b>It is vibrant.</b>

37:39.759 --> 37:41.639
<b>But if you can't produce</b>
<b>a more dynamic drawing,</b>

37:41.728 --> 37:43.329
<b>you don't have a hope</b>
<b>of winning this thing.</b>

37:43.429 --> 37:46.099
<b>- I believe that it is a better</b>
<b>drawing than St. Marq's.</b>

37:46.199 --> 37:47.333
<b>- This is the third time</b>
<b>he's been down here.</b>

37:47.433 --> 37:50.103
<b>You were self-described</b>
<b>as this being your jam,</b>

37:50.203 --> 37:50.970
<b>like, new school is your thing.</b>

37:51.070 --> 37:53.539
<b>- And I think it clearly shows</b>

37:53.640 --> 37:55.675
<b>that it's more mine</b>
<b>than it is yours.</b>

37:55.775 --> 37:57.243
<b>He did, like, "Puff the Magic</b>
<b>Dragon" on some kid's leg.</b>

37:57.343 --> 37:58.578
<b>- It's your [bleep] thing.</b>

37:58.678 --> 38:00.179
<b>- He's probably</b>
<b>gonna get it lasered off.</b>

38:00.279 --> 38:01.948
<b>- Marq, fundamentally,</b>
<b>yours looks patchy.</b>

38:02.048 --> 38:03.249
<b>Your line work looks sketchy.</b>

38:03.349 --> 38:04.829
<b>Your background</b>
<b>doesn't look finished.</b>

38:04.917 --> 38:07.117
<b>The whole thing was about color,</b>
<b>and purple, and orange,</b>

38:07.153 --> 38:09.422
<b>and gray</b>
<b>is not aesthetically pleasing.</b>

38:09.522 --> 38:11.557
<b>- St. Marq, not hitting</b>
<b>the new-school thing,</b>

38:11.658 --> 38:13.192
<b>that's kind</b>
<b>of the expected miss.</b>

38:13.292 --> 38:14.292
<b>Color theory also weak.</b>

38:14.327 --> 38:16.696
<b>But your application</b>
<b>in this, Marq,</b>

38:16.796 --> 38:18.364
<b>is where you fall the shortest.</b>

38:18.531 --> 38:20.800
<b>I think the basic fundamental of</b>
<b>the way Megan's tattoo</b>

38:20.900 --> 38:23.569
<b>is laid out is a bad idea.</b>

38:23.670 --> 38:25.872
<b>It's not</b>
<b>a well-constructed drawing.</b>

38:25.972 --> 38:27.573
<b>- I was wrong in assuming</b>

38:27.674 --> 38:28.941
<b>that with new school I had</b>
<b>a lot more wiggle room.</b>

38:29.042 --> 38:31.277
<b>- You have wiggle room</b>
<b>to do whatever.</b>

38:31.377 --> 38:33.497
<b>You can play with proportions</b>
<b>and make it unrealistic,</b>

38:33.546 --> 38:34.614
<b>but it always</b>
<b>wants to look appealing.</b>

38:34.714 --> 38:36.549
<b>- It's misshapen,</b>
<b>so all that blue just</b>

38:36.649 --> 38:37.750
<b>makes it look</b>
<b>like a big blue circle.</b>

38:37.850 --> 38:39.952
<b>- Still a much more</b>
<b>solid tattoo than you did.</b>

38:40.053 --> 38:41.321
<b>- You have your opinions, man,</b>
<b>but I mean,</b>

38:41.421 --> 38:42.922
<b>that's what we're talking about.</b>

38:43.022 --> 38:44.290
<b>- It is factually more solid.</b>

38:44.390 --> 38:46.259
<b> <i>As far as ink application</i> </b>
<b> <i>to the skin,</i> </b>

38:46.359 --> 38:49.996
<b>on a technical side, Marq,</b>
<b>yours is the weakest.</b>

38:50.096 --> 38:51.597
<b>But, Megan, your drawing today</b>

38:51.698 --> 38:53.700
<b>is the one</b>
<b>that is the most troubling.</b>

38:53.800 --> 38:55.068
