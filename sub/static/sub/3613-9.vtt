00:30.054 --> 00:32.925
- Matthew?
- Hello, Melinda.

00:33.474 --> 00:35.016
Why?

00:35.184 --> 00:36.595
Why did you betray me?

00:38.229 --> 00:40.186
You got what you deserve.

00:41.232 --> 00:43.936
So you never loved me?

00:44.109 --> 00:46.861
All the passion? All the heat?

00:47.071 --> 00:49.443
I had to make you trust me.

00:49.615 --> 00:52.284
It was the only way
to share your powers.

00:53.285 --> 00:55.574
And so now you have them.

00:55.746 --> 00:58.912
So why would you turn me in?
You know I'll burn.

01:00.626 --> 01:02.748
Had to keep my secret.

01:03.086 --> 01:05.293
Well, you can keep your trinkets too.

01:10.010 --> 01:13.426
- I'll find another witch to give it to.
- Maybe not.

01:16.057 --> 01:17.468
What magic is this?

01:17.684 --> 01:20.222
I'm taking back the powers
you stole from me.

01:21.312 --> 01:24.516
<i>Outside of time, outside of gain</i>

01:24.691 --> 01:27.727
<i>Know only sorrow, know only pain</i>

01:28.111 --> 01:29.819
No!

01:59.850 --> 02:01.309
Rex.

02:02.227 --> 02:03.425
Good morning, Prue.

02:03.604 --> 02:05.680
I've left a few things for you
to catalogue.

02:05.898 --> 02:08.436
A marvellous shipment
from an estate back east.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.726
- I'll get right on it.
- Thanks.

02:27.585 --> 02:29.245
At last.

02:30.130 --> 02:32.003
Freedom.

02:32.966 --> 02:34.793
The world has changed.

02:36.719 --> 02:38.214
What time is this?

02:39.514 --> 02:41.886
- Excuse me?
- Where am I?

02:42.100 --> 02:44.341
- Who are you?
- Matthew Tate.

02:45.311 --> 02:47.980
And if you freed me from that locket,

02:48.147 --> 02:51.148
you are a descendant
of Melinda Warren.

02:58.824 --> 03:01.576
- Thank you.
- For what?

03:04.413 --> 03:08.363
I tricked you into using
your power on me.

03:08.542 --> 03:10.748
Now I have it.

03:18.594 --> 03:20.752
Behind you, witch.

03:22.306 --> 03:25.093
- How did you do that?
- I can share your powers,

03:25.267 --> 03:27.259
but you can't share mine.

03:28.019 --> 03:32.516
- What do you want?
- I want what Melinda took from me.

03:32.691 --> 03:35.360
I want all three powers back.

03:38.446 --> 03:42.147
Defend yourself. Stop time.

03:42.534 --> 03:44.407
I can't.

03:44.744 --> 03:47.449
So you're not alone.

03:47.622 --> 03:49.780
There are others.

03:54.003 --> 03:56.459
And the family name
is now Halliwell.

03:56.964 --> 03:58.459
Prue? Are you okay in there?

04:13.189 --> 04:14.599
Hey. Did you see that?

06:24.525 --> 06:26.814
I was just sitting there, you know,
reading sports,

06:26.986 --> 06:28.895
having a cup of Joe, and bam,

06:29.113 --> 06:33.027
this guy comes flying out of nowhere,
you know. Weird clothes,

06:33.200 --> 06:35.489
bad manners.
Nearly fell right on top of me.

06:35.661 --> 06:37.618
- When you say "fell"...?
- I mean fell.

06:37.788 --> 06:40.659
You know, like from way up there,
I guess. I don't know.

06:40.875 --> 06:43.994
- That's a ten-story drop, sir.
- Twelve.

06:44.211 --> 06:47.545
And you're telling us that he just got up
and walked away without a scratch?

06:47.715 --> 06:50.751
- That's what you're saying?
- Got a better explanation?

06:51.802 --> 06:53.261
Excuse us.

06:57.349 --> 06:59.092
All right, Trudeau.

06:59.267 --> 07:02.767
Pull out your secret ghost hunter
decoder ring, and let's hear it.

07:02.938 --> 07:04.313
Look, Morris, I don't know, okay?

07:04.481 --> 07:07.601
All I know is whatever happened
started up there in that office.

07:08.610 --> 07:12.690
- So let's find out whose office it is.
- I already know.

07:12.864 --> 07:15.022
It's Prue's.

07:17.786 --> 07:22.282
So I suggested we add crab satay
to the lunch menu, and it was great.

07:22.499 --> 07:24.076
Sold out. Do you like crab, Leo?

07:24.292 --> 07:26.913
- You know what I'd love, Piper?
- What's that?

07:27.128 --> 07:30.248
Is the ratchet extension.
Could you hand that to me?

07:30.465 --> 07:32.042
Sure.

07:37.930 --> 07:39.970
I know that.

07:40.182 --> 07:41.511
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

07:44.770 --> 07:45.801
Go away.

07:45.980 --> 07:49.230
- Be right back, Leo.
- No problem.

07:50.818 --> 07:53.309
- Stop it.
- My sentiments exactly.

07:53.529 --> 07:55.854
Stop hinting around
and ask him out already.

07:56.031 --> 07:57.988
- Give him your crab.
- Don't be disgusting.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.905
- Don't be so shy.
- What if he says no?

08:01.120 --> 08:03.112
- Yeah, like that'll happen.
- No, I'm serious.

08:03.330 --> 08:06.580
- So am I.
- I'm very serious. I've never...

08:07.251 --> 08:08.579
...you know...

08:09.711 --> 08:12.202
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

08:12.422 --> 08:14.000
You've never asked
a guy out before?

08:14.216 --> 08:15.674
Not on a real date, no.

08:15.884 --> 08:19.751
Am I the only person in this family who
inherited the take-a-chance gene?

08:20.055 --> 08:22.510
Probably, because if I remember
my biology correctly,

08:22.682 --> 08:25.719
it's attached to
the can't-mind-my-own-business gene.

08:25.935 --> 08:27.311
Go!

08:31.483 --> 08:33.974
Well, part of the pipe is stuck,
but I'm almost finished here.

08:34.152 --> 08:35.812
Terrific. Can I get you some tea?

08:36.029 --> 08:38.270
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Okay.

08:40.658 --> 08:44.157
- What would be great?
- Nothing.

08:45.538 --> 08:47.447
Leo!

08:48.749 --> 08:50.541
Leo?

08:50.751 --> 08:53.159
Frozen. Quick,
have your way with him.

08:53.379 --> 08:55.039
Do you never stop?

08:55.506 --> 08:59.420
- Looks like a Kodak moment to me.
- Phoebe, you're such a help.

08:59.593 --> 09:01.385
Smile.

09:05.599 --> 09:07.307
You guys, we are in serious trouble.

09:10.145 --> 09:12.815
- Hi, Leo.
- Hey, Prue.

09:13.315 --> 09:16.186
Hey. Sisters, upstairs. Now.

09:23.575 --> 09:25.817
Webster. Hannah Webster.

09:26.036 --> 09:28.325
You said you heard some noises
in here. What kind?

09:30.123 --> 09:31.452
It's hard to say.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.748
It almost sounded like

09:33.919 --> 09:36.456
a struggle of some sort.

09:36.630 --> 09:39.880
- A fight, perhaps.
- Yeah, and then we heard a crash.

09:40.050 --> 09:43.050
And I assumed that was
the window breaking,

09:43.219 --> 09:46.220
and we came in to check on Prue,

09:46.389 --> 09:48.014
and then she just went running out.

09:48.224 --> 09:49.932
What did she say? What happened?

09:50.143 --> 09:53.927
Nothing, actually. She just left.

09:54.147 --> 09:56.104
She was quite agitated too.

09:56.315 --> 09:58.273
She didn't say where she was going,
did she?

09:58.442 --> 10:00.400
No. No, sorry.

10:01.362 --> 10:02.821
Okay. Thanks, Mr Buckland.

10:02.989 --> 10:06.025
CSI will be done with the windows
soon, and you can have them fixed.

10:06.242 --> 10:08.863
Believe me, inspector,
I really don't care about the window.

10:09.036 --> 10:10.411
I only care about Prue.

10:16.126 --> 10:20.456
Look, maybe you ought to ask
the captain to assign somebody else.

10:20.631 --> 10:23.501
Prue and I aren't dating anymore.
There's no conflict, okay?

10:23.675 --> 10:25.668
I'm fine with this.

10:27.554 --> 10:28.835
Okay.

10:30.974 --> 10:32.053
Okay.

10:33.310 --> 10:37.058
I thought that went exceedingly well,
didn't you?

10:37.606 --> 10:40.357
You may have proven
the legend of the locket true

10:40.525 --> 10:43.277
and that the little witch is charmed,

10:43.445 --> 10:46.730
but now we have a 17th-century
warlock running around.

10:46.906 --> 10:48.864
I think he'll stick out.

10:49.034 --> 10:52.319
Yep. But then again,
if the legend does hold true,

10:52.495 --> 10:54.737
Matthew's got a one-track mind...

10:55.999 --> 10:58.240
...just like we do.

10:58.418 --> 11:00.909
He won't be difficult to find.

11:01.087 --> 11:03.459
Stop worrying, Hannah.

11:04.007 --> 11:07.091
You're gonna get wrinkles
on your horns.

11:09.887 --> 11:12.010
What did he say his name was?

11:12.640 --> 11:13.968
Matthew Tate.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.929
And somehow he knows that
we're related to Melinda Warren.

11:17.687 --> 11:20.224
<i>The Book of Shadows Melinda?
Our ancestor?</i>

11:20.606 --> 11:23.275
The one who burned at the stake
and started this whole mess.

11:23.484 --> 11:25.690
Yeah, he came out of the locket.

11:25.861 --> 11:27.984
And he has strong powers,
stronger than mine.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.278
I mean, he did the weirdest thing.

11:30.449 --> 11:34.032
One minute, he was in front of me,
the next, he was behind me,

11:34.203 --> 11:36.776
and then 12 stories down.
Landed right on his feet.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.405
If it walks like a warlock
and talks like a warlock...

11:39.583 --> 11:41.706
Yeah, well, he's powerful,

11:41.877 --> 11:44.831
and he means business, and he wants
all three of our powers.

11:45.047 --> 11:46.755
Can I see the locket?

11:47.799 --> 11:50.966
We have to figure out who he is
before he finds the two of you.

11:53.722 --> 11:55.180
No!

11:57.934 --> 12:00.721
You said Matthew came out
of the locket?

12:00.895 --> 12:03.730
I think I just saw Melinda
put him in.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.138
You saw the past?

12:06.025 --> 12:09.809
- But you only see the future.
- Not anymore.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.106
We always knew that our powers
would grow.

12:12.323 --> 12:16.985
Yes, but somehow I thought
I was gonna get to fly.

12:22.416 --> 12:23.579
They wanna countersue?

12:23.918 --> 12:26.456
Fine, bring it on. I'll eat them alive.

12:26.629 --> 12:29.583
Plus, we can double-bill
and get away with it.

12:32.093 --> 12:33.587
Excuse me.

12:33.761 --> 12:36.252
Are you Arnold Halliwell?

12:37.139 --> 12:39.132
Yeah.

12:39.308 --> 12:40.932
And who are you, Robin Hood?

12:46.774 --> 12:49.146
Tell me where your sisters are.

12:49.860 --> 12:51.936
What sisters?

12:52.529 --> 12:54.273
I'm an only child.

12:55.616 --> 12:58.735
Let me go, or I'll sue you.

13:02.497 --> 13:05.617
Lawyers have not changed.

13:09.629 --> 13:12.796
I was right.
It was Melinda in my vision.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.709
Isn't she beautiful?

13:16.136 --> 13:18.591
She kind of looks like Mom.

13:18.805 --> 13:21.759
Listen to this. "And because
the warlock had stolen her love,

13:21.933 --> 13:24.803
she cursed him into the pewter heart
where he could spend eternity

13:24.978 --> 13:27.054
knowing the sting of betrayal."

13:27.730 --> 13:31.313
- That must be what I saw.
- And I let him out early. Great.

13:31.526 --> 13:34.811
You're not kidding. The legend says
that the warlock must never be freed,

13:34.987 --> 13:38.154
or he will destroy the Warren line.
That'd be us.

13:38.324 --> 13:41.823
Well, he'll have to take a number and
get in line behind the other warlocks.

13:41.994 --> 13:44.829
We've never been up against
anyone like him before.

13:45.039 --> 13:46.533
- So, what do we do?
- I say we hide.

13:46.707 --> 13:49.376
No, we have to find out exactly
what we're up against.

13:49.543 --> 13:52.295
And we start with the locket
and how it wound up on my desk.

13:54.298 --> 13:56.041
Prue, your work's on the news.
Check it out.

13:56.216 --> 14:00.214
<i>Witnesses claim they saw a man
fall 12 stories. The twist?</i>

14:00.429 --> 14:03.595
<i>He apparently got up
and walked away unharmed.</i>

14:03.807 --> 14:05.681
We gotta find him
before he hurts anybody else.

14:05.851 --> 14:07.642
Especially an innocent.

14:07.811 --> 14:10.480
- There's that I word again.
- Look, Andy's on TV.

14:10.689 --> 14:14.105
<i>This has been the most unbelievable
thing I've ever seen.</i>

14:14.276 --> 14:15.438
He's here too.

14:15.652 --> 14:20.148
<i>And this guy, he just landed
out of nowhere.</i>

14:22.158 --> 14:24.116
Andy. What a surprise.

14:25.078 --> 14:28.114
- How you been?
- I need to talk with Prue, Phoebe.

14:28.331 --> 14:31.367
Prue? Wow, how out
of the loop am I?

14:31.543 --> 14:33.535
And here I thought
you guys broke up.

14:33.711 --> 14:35.953
It's not about that.
It's police business.

14:36.214 --> 14:39.547
Oh, well, she's not home.
She's at work.

14:39.759 --> 14:41.301
No, she's not.

14:41.511 --> 14:42.839
Then I don't know where she is.

14:43.012 --> 14:46.547
<i>But I'll tell her that you
stopped by, okay? Ciao.</i>

14:47.391 --> 14:51.389
A man fell out Prue's office window,
which is suspicious enough,

14:51.812 --> 14:53.604
but then a man matching
the same description

14:53.773 --> 14:55.646
went and killed a lawyer
down the street.

14:55.816 --> 14:57.192
A lawyer named Halliwell.

14:58.110 --> 15:00.731
Now, I know she knows who he is.

15:01.113 --> 15:03.734
One more time, Phoebe.
Where's your sister?

15:05.743 --> 15:07.071
Where's your warrant?

15:18.839 --> 15:23.086
Great, so now I'm being hunted by
a warlock and the San Francisco P.D.

15:23.260 --> 15:25.383
Nobody ever said you led
a boring life, Prue.

15:25.846 --> 15:29.179
- Maybe Andy can help.
- You wanna have that conversation?

15:29.349 --> 15:30.760
"Hey, Andy, I hate to bother you,

15:30.934 --> 15:35.596
but a 17th-century warlock is trying to
kill me and my sisters. Any thoughts?"

15:35.814 --> 15:38.768
Okay, it was a bad idea,
but the point is, we need help.

15:38.983 --> 15:41.605
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
more than Andy can give.

15:41.820 --> 15:44.655
What we need is someone
who's done this before.

15:44.822 --> 15:46.614
Someone like Melinda Warren.

15:47.784 --> 15:49.657
Okay, so what are we
supposed to do?

15:49.827 --> 15:52.532
Reach back in time, grab her
and tell her that we need her help?

15:52.914 --> 15:56.496
Yes. And I know exactly how to do it.

15:56.667 --> 16:00.914
As long as you both don't mind
losing a little blood.

16:01.088 --> 16:02.832
Am I the only one
having second thoughts?

16:03.007 --> 16:04.916
- Yes.
- We don't really have other options.

16:05.092 --> 16:07.630
But aren't we, like, raising the dead?
What if she's all...?

16:07.803 --> 16:09.926
<i>I read the Book of Shadows
very carefully.</i>

16:10.097 --> 16:13.015
She will come back as a real,
live person, flesh and blood.

16:13.184 --> 16:16.683
She will have her powers too.
Our powers.

16:16.854 --> 16:18.182
What's that for?

16:18.355 --> 16:20.929
Well, the spell works by
blood calling blood.

16:21.108 --> 16:23.599
So it shouldn't hurt much.

16:24.528 --> 16:26.485
I lied. I lied.

16:27.739 --> 16:30.657
Okay, come on, you guys, it'll be
just like that summer by the lake.

16:30.826 --> 16:34.870
Remember? We made a blood oath
to be friends forever, not just sisters.

16:35.038 --> 16:38.205
- I remember my finger got infected.
- Yeah, but the oath worked.

16:38.416 --> 16:41.417
And I couldn't go in the water for three
weeks. Don't hand me that knife.

16:41.628 --> 16:43.621
- How are you gonna cut yourself?
- I'm not.

16:44.965 --> 16:47.965
- Piper?
- I can't stand the sight of blood.

16:48.176 --> 16:50.501
Evil beings have blown up in our attic.

16:50.720 --> 16:53.425
Disintegrated to dust right
before our very eyes.

16:53.765 --> 16:55.804
And you're afraid of
a little drop of blood?

16:56.017 --> 16:58.223
- Okay, just cut my finger.
- You do it.

17:03.191 --> 17:04.270
Okay, here.

17:16.037 --> 17:19.536
<i>Melinda Warren, blood of our blood</i>

17:19.707 --> 17:22.910
<i>Our great- great- great- great-
great- great- grandmother</i>

17:23.085 --> 17:25.041
<i>We summon thee</i>

17:38.851 --> 17:40.428
Blessed be.

17:51.279 --> 17:55.229
No, don't rip the dress
to make it fit me.

17:55.408 --> 17:59.323
Oh, no, I'm not ripping it.
It's called a zipper. See?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.704
A wise witch made this.

18:03.875 --> 18:07.042
Yeah, and wise witches in this century
keep a low profile.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.667
You slip this dress on,
you'll blend right in.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.757
It's so odd to be here again,

18:12.925 --> 18:15.926
to breathe and feel.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.179
What sheep has wool so soft?

18:19.348 --> 18:21.886
A synthetic one.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.312
So did it take you long
to make the dress?

18:25.479 --> 18:27.887
Make it? No, I bought it.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.188
Oh, you must be rich.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.150
Oh, she's got credit cards.

18:32.319 --> 18:35.237
- Oh, wow, Melinda, you look great.
- Oh, thank you.

18:35.406 --> 18:38.822
- How do you keep your legs warm?
- We drink coffee.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.739
Oh, sorry, I let myself in,
and it didn't occur to me that...

18:42.913 --> 18:44.491
Leo, oh, it's okay.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.707
- This is...
- Our cousin Melinda.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.835
- Nice to meet you.
- Leo's fixing our plumbing.

18:51.171 --> 18:54.836
- What's that?
- We've got to go now.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.503
To work with one's hands
is a great gift.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.923
Well, I am a true labourer:
I earn that I eat, get that I wear.

19:02.098 --> 19:04.886
Owe no man hate,
envy no man's happiness.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.634
- Shakespeare.
- Shakespeare.

19:07.979 --> 19:10.684
Wasn't that fun? Okay, let's go now.

19:16.070 --> 19:18.063
He is a treasure, Piper.

19:18.239 --> 19:20.232
Why are you telling me?

19:28.291 --> 19:29.701
Well, hello, Matthew.

19:29.876 --> 19:31.999
We've got to do something
about his clothes.

19:32.211 --> 19:34.334
Who are you?
How do you know me?

19:34.630 --> 19:37.086
The short answer is,
we're the ones that gave the witch

19:37.258 --> 19:38.835
the locket that had you freed.

19:39.051 --> 19:41.673
I suppose you could say
that we're partners.

19:42.304 --> 19:45.424
- I work alone.
- No, not in this century, you don't.

19:45.599 --> 19:47.473
You're new in town,

19:47.643 --> 19:49.766
new in time.

19:49.979 --> 19:51.770
You need our help.

19:53.607 --> 19:57.106
I see you've been shopping.
Find what you're looking for?

19:57.444 --> 20:00.362
I want Melinda Warren's children.

20:01.073 --> 20:03.611
Talk about your coincidences.

20:03.784 --> 20:07.069
You see, we have the means
to find them for you,

20:07.245 --> 20:10.994
and you have the ability
to take their powers.

20:11.208 --> 20:12.618
Come.

20:14.586 --> 20:16.210
What?

20:16.421 --> 20:17.702
How'd you find me?

20:17.923 --> 20:20.248
Prue Halliwell, the Halliwell attorney,
now here.

20:20.425 --> 20:22.583
You are leaving a trail, my friend.

20:22.761 --> 20:24.552
And that has got to stop.

20:28.975 --> 20:30.884
Once Matthew had what he wanted,

20:31.060 --> 20:34.227
he told the town council
I was a witch...

20:34.897 --> 20:36.605
...and they arrested me.

20:37.150 --> 20:39.475
Then they burned me at the stake.

20:39.652 --> 20:41.810
Why didn't you save yourself?

20:41.988 --> 20:44.111
Yeah, why didn't you use
your powers to escape?

20:44.740 --> 20:46.947
I had a daughter.

20:47.660 --> 20:49.320
Her name was Prudence.

20:50.746 --> 20:52.620
She meant everything to me.

20:53.833 --> 20:56.999
If I had used my powers,
I would've proven Matthew's charge.

20:57.169 --> 20:58.961
And Prudence would've burned too.

20:59.922 --> 21:01.831
No, I thought,

21:02.049 --> 21:03.709
"I'll accept this

21:03.884 --> 21:07.253
and pray some kind soul will take pity
on my daughter

21:07.429 --> 21:09.007
and raise her in a safe home.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.843
Only then can
the Warren line continue."

21:13.018 --> 21:16.683
And it must've worked,
because here you are.

21:17.397 --> 21:19.971
Why do Warren witches lose their
moms so early?

21:21.860 --> 21:26.486
Phoebe, I can't change the past,
but I think I can protect the future.

21:26.698 --> 21:30.743
How? Matthew is so strong,
and he has this wild power.

21:30.911 --> 21:33.283
He can be at one place
and then another.

21:33.496 --> 21:35.536
- In the blink of an eye?
- Exactly.

21:36.041 --> 21:37.321
It's called blinking.

21:37.834 --> 21:40.455
He must've copied it
from another witch.

21:40.628 --> 21:43.166
I stripped him of all the powers
he copied from me,

21:43.381 --> 21:45.623
but who knows what
other powers he still has.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.508
What do you mean,
copied from you?

21:47.969 --> 21:50.674
Matthew's gift is to copy
the power of a good witch

21:50.847 --> 21:52.341
when it's used against him.

21:52.557 --> 21:53.967
Then he definitely has mine.

21:54.142 --> 21:58.056
Once he's copied a power,
it has no effect on him.

21:58.229 --> 22:01.265
Should he gain all three powers,

22:01.440 --> 22:03.812
he will be impossible to vanquish.

22:04.110 --> 22:08.902
- So, what do we do?
- We curse him back into the locket.

22:09.281 --> 22:10.740
And if we can't?

22:19.958 --> 22:23.410
Are these pants
meant to be so tight?

22:24.379 --> 22:26.039
Absolutely.

22:26.215 --> 22:28.207
No wonder your men frown
all the time.

22:28.383 --> 22:29.961
It's a wonder they can even walk.

22:30.135 --> 22:32.377
- So is this right?
- Oh, yeah.

22:33.305 --> 22:35.593
If it pleases you to look, look.

22:37.976 --> 22:40.099
I wasn't looking...

22:40.270 --> 22:41.930
...much.

22:42.564 --> 22:45.600
Why the false modesty?

22:45.775 --> 22:47.649
I don't understand.

22:48.778 --> 22:53.606
Well, it's a very complex issue
these days.

22:53.783 --> 22:58.659
I mean, there's political correctness,
sexual harassment.

22:58.830 --> 23:00.906
Don't get me started.

23:01.874 --> 23:04.544
What a strange time this is.

23:04.710 --> 23:11.128
So open, yet so closed,
where even a warlock feels shame.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.127
Hannah...

23:13.678 --> 23:16.928
- What the devil?
- Rex, I told you I'd get him dressed.

23:17.139 --> 23:19.511
Yeah. Ten minutes ago.

23:20.309 --> 23:25.101
We've tried on many things.
She says it is difficult to choose.

23:25.314 --> 23:27.223
Playtime's over, big boy.

23:27.399 --> 23:29.807
You have a job to do.

23:31.320 --> 23:34.523
Remember, he goes back
from whence he came

23:34.698 --> 23:37.070
once his task is completed.

23:37.367 --> 23:40.285
I can't believe I don't remember
all the ingredients.

23:40.454 --> 23:42.197
It's been a while since
you cursed Matthew.

23:42.372 --> 23:43.653
Yeah, like 300 years.

23:43.832 --> 23:46.121
Whatever you don't remember
should be in the book.

23:46.334 --> 23:48.126
<i>The Book of Shadows.</i>

23:48.295 --> 23:50.916
Oh, my, it's gotten so thick.

23:51.131 --> 23:53.456
- It wasn't always?
- No. No,

23:53.633 --> 23:55.875
but obviously, each generation
of Warren witches

23:56.052 --> 23:58.460
has added to it over the years
and has made it so.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.263
Have you added anything?

24:00.682 --> 24:02.970
Us? Are you kidding?
We're new at this.

24:03.143 --> 24:05.847
We can't just make up our own spell...
Wait, can we?

24:06.020 --> 24:09.105
All things in time, Phoebe.

24:09.315 --> 24:10.644
The book will grow as you grow.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.771
And sometimes you add to it,
sometimes it teaches you.

24:13.945 --> 24:15.653
Oh, here's the curse.

24:20.243 --> 24:21.820
Just start writing.

24:22.453 --> 24:25.370
- No ink?
- No.

24:31.086 --> 24:32.996
Grams must've added this one.

24:33.964 --> 24:36.123
To increase patience.

24:36.300 --> 24:39.550
I bet she used that spell a lot
raising us, huh?

24:39.720 --> 24:41.677
We weren't
all troublemakers, Phoebe.

24:41.847 --> 24:44.005
I was not a troublemaker.
I was just...

24:44.224 --> 24:45.635
A pain.

24:45.851 --> 24:47.808
- A free spirit.
- A handful.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.348
A Warren.

24:49.563 --> 24:51.223
It's a family trait.

24:51.440 --> 24:54.773
So are the short tempers,
the great cheekbones,

24:54.943 --> 24:58.644
the strong wills and,
of course, the powers.

24:58.822 --> 25:00.316
All blessings.

25:00.490 --> 25:02.981
All signs of where you came from.

25:03.410 --> 25:05.402
This book is your connection.

25:05.620 --> 25:07.079
And it began with me.

25:07.539 --> 25:09.662
Well, let's make sure
it doesn't end with us.

25:09.833 --> 25:11.825
We need to get going.

25:15.255 --> 25:17.496
This is Prue.

25:17.715 --> 25:18.996
You've already met.

25:19.175 --> 25:23.504
This is Piper, and this is Phoebe.

25:23.680 --> 25:26.005
Such marvellous paintings.

25:26.182 --> 25:28.221
You cannot feel the brushstrokes.

25:28.434 --> 25:29.597
Yeah.

25:29.769 --> 25:32.390
Remind us to take you to the movies
when this is all over.

25:32.605 --> 25:36.021
This is the address of Quake.
Piper works there.

25:36.192 --> 25:40.024
May I suggest that you go there next
and take her power?

25:41.822 --> 25:44.194
Hannah will drive you.

25:50.456 --> 25:52.365
The curse is really simple,

25:52.583 --> 25:54.789
as long as you have
the ingredients I need.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.712
Phoebe can do the spices,
and I'll chop the scallions.

25:57.880 --> 26:00.417
This is so cool.
We've never done a curse before.

26:00.591 --> 26:03.508
Oh, I'm glad.
They're not to be taken lightly.

26:03.677 --> 26:07.377
I just feel like there's so much
we could be learning or doing

26:07.556 --> 26:09.429
if we had the right teacher.

26:09.599 --> 26:13.679
Well, I'd savour my first gift before
I move on to the next one.

26:13.854 --> 26:16.605
I see pictures. What's to savour?

26:16.773 --> 26:21.269
No, but you see visions
of the future and the past

26:21.444 --> 26:24.611
that'll allow you to protect
and to heal.

26:25.615 --> 26:26.990
Did you hear that, Prue?

26:27.367 --> 26:30.617
Prue, stop looking for Andy.
He should be long gone by now.

26:31.329 --> 26:33.654
Yeah, he'll be back.
Probably with a warrant.

26:33.831 --> 26:37.081
Yeah, like Andy
would ever arrest you.

26:37.627 --> 26:40.628
So do we have everything?

26:40.797 --> 26:42.540
Actually, there's a few herbs
we don't have,

26:42.715 --> 26:44.209
but I can get them at the restaurant.

26:44.383 --> 26:48.084
Yeah, the only problem is the feather
from a spotted owl.

26:48.304 --> 26:51.139
- Is that a problem?
- Well, they're an endangered species.

26:53.100 --> 26:55.638
Certain animals from your time
aren't really around anymore.

26:55.853 --> 26:59.981
- Why?
- Deforestation, pollution...

27:00.149 --> 27:02.474
It's a long story.

27:02.651 --> 27:04.145
Do you think they have one
at the zoo?

27:04.361 --> 27:06.484
What's a zoo?

27:06.739 --> 27:09.276
In theory, it's this big
garden kind of place

27:09.450 --> 27:11.691
where all the animals
are caged, and it's...

27:11.910 --> 27:13.654
You know what?
I'll work on the feather.

27:13.870 --> 27:15.863
Piper, can you handle the herbs?

27:16.039 --> 27:18.910
Yeah, after I get to Quake, though
I might have a problem getting out

27:19.084 --> 27:21.041
because I'm supposed to work
the night shift.

27:21.211 --> 27:24.331
Well, I'll come with you and bring back
the stuff if you get hung up.

27:24.506 --> 27:26.333
No, you can't leave the house.

27:26.508 --> 27:28.500
You are the two Matthew needs.

27:29.010 --> 27:31.845
Yeah, we'll be fine. How could
Matthew even know about Quake?

27:38.102 --> 27:41.518
I have waited over 300 years
for my revenge.

27:41.898 --> 27:46.476
As soon as Piper gets here,
I shall have it.

27:50.490 --> 27:51.865
You go ahead into the kitchen.

27:52.033 --> 27:54.440
I'm gonna cough on Martin
and tell him I'm highly contagious

27:54.619 --> 27:56.161
- so I can go home.
- Love the plan.

27:56.329 --> 27:58.405
Hey, Piper.
Did your sweetie find you?

27:58.998 --> 28:01.037
- My what?
- That guy with the English accent.

28:01.250 --> 28:04.500
He called earlier to see
if you were working today.

28:16.765 --> 28:18.972
Now I have your power.

28:19.143 --> 28:21.978
And I see Melinda's here. Good.

28:22.146 --> 28:24.518
She will die at my hand.

28:27.901 --> 28:29.941
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

28:30.112 --> 28:33.148
It was Matthew. He's gone.

28:33.323 --> 28:36.075
But he copied my power.

28:41.623 --> 28:44.992
All right, I found a spotted owl at the
museum where I used to work, stuffed.

28:45.168 --> 28:46.995
But we only need one feather.

28:47.170 --> 28:49.328
Good. Maybe that'll keep it down
to a misdemeanour.

28:49.506 --> 28:52.423
- Look, I'll be back as soon as I can.
- Okay.

29:32.881 --> 29:34.755
Come on, answer.

29:37.302 --> 29:39.509
<i>Hi, we're not home.
You know the drill.</i>

29:40.597 --> 29:42.673
Prue, pick up.

29:42.849 --> 29:44.094
Phoebe?

29:44.309 --> 29:47.310
- Are you guys there?
- Phoebe, I'm here.

29:47.521 --> 29:49.312
<i>Okay, you guys need
to be really careful.</i>

29:49.481 --> 29:51.308
<i>- Phoebe?
- Matthew was here.</i>

29:51.483 --> 29:54.519
<i>- He could be on his way.
- The machine is off.</i>

29:55.320 --> 29:57.194
Line went dead.

30:02.202 --> 30:04.159
Matthew.

30:04.329 --> 30:06.998
- We meet again.
- Yes.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.828
And the sight of you
still makes me ill.

30:10.209 --> 30:14.503
Funny, the fact that I can now
destroy your line forever

30:14.672 --> 30:17.507
makes you so much
more appealing.

30:18.509 --> 30:21.427
- You think I won't stop you?
- How?

30:21.596 --> 30:24.466
You made your curse before,
and you still burned.

30:24.807 --> 30:27.013
And yet I'm here now, aren't I?

30:27.226 --> 30:28.851
You're nothing more
than a dead witch

30:29.019 --> 30:32.305
watching over stupid girls
who are about to die themselves.

30:32.731 --> 30:35.020
- You won't touch them.
- Too late.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.392
I already have two of their powers.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.028
I just need the third.

30:39.196 --> 30:42.197
I believe her name is Piper.

30:42.408 --> 30:46.191
- Unless you wanna freeze me.
- Go to hell, where you belong.

30:57.631 --> 31:00.038
So that's why
they brought you back.

31:00.217 --> 31:01.675
Isn't it?

31:01.843 --> 31:04.215
You think you can curse me again.

31:05.555 --> 31:08.342
Hell, I might just kill you now.

31:08.516 --> 31:10.058
Go ahead.

31:10.226 --> 31:13.346
- I've already given them the curse.
- You're lying.

31:13.563 --> 31:15.888
Am I?

31:18.401 --> 31:21.852
The one with the feather,
where is she now?

31:22.071 --> 31:23.613
Where's Prue? Tell me!

31:23.781 --> 31:25.857
- She's at...
- Yes?

31:26.451 --> 31:27.779
The zoo.

31:29.078 --> 31:31.865
Then that's where I'll kill her.

31:32.039 --> 31:34.744
And then I'll come back
for the other two.

31:35.167 --> 31:38.417
That way, you can watch them die...

31:39.672 --> 31:42.127
...and I can watch you suffer.

31:50.432 --> 31:52.341
And then...

31:52.518 --> 31:54.427
...you'll be next.

32:10.660 --> 32:11.740
You lost him.

32:12.495 --> 32:15.615
We've had this conversation before,
Rex. Please stay out of my mind.

32:16.374 --> 32:19.874
- Well, did he copy Piper's power?
- I have no idea.

32:20.045 --> 32:23.544
Something happened in the restaurant,
though, because he just took off.

32:23.715 --> 32:24.995
And so did they.

32:26.050 --> 32:27.331
And why didn't you follow him?

32:27.510 --> 32:29.669
I tried. Why don't you just follow them
right now?

32:29.887 --> 32:33.256
Because I haven't mastered
that ability yet, unfortunately.

32:36.144 --> 32:39.180
We need Matthew to provide us
with the sisters' powers.

32:39.355 --> 32:41.431
Otherwise, we don't stand
a chance in hell.

32:43.192 --> 32:45.149
Find him.

32:49.907 --> 32:52.480
- Prue? Melinda?
- In here.

32:54.995 --> 32:57.451
- Are you okay?
- It was Matthew, wasn't it?

32:57.623 --> 32:59.865
Yes. But don't worry, he's gone.

33:00.084 --> 33:02.325
He found us at the restaurant,
and he copied my power.

33:02.544 --> 33:04.288
He said he was gonna kill you,
and I was...

33:04.463 --> 33:05.922
It's all right, Phoebe.

33:06.090 --> 33:08.296
But we've got to hurry
before Matthew gets back.

33:08.467 --> 33:09.961
Did you get all the herbs?

33:10.135 --> 33:11.795
Yeah, all we need now
is the feather.

33:11.970 --> 33:14.508
Good. Prue's taken care of that.

33:15.599 --> 33:17.259
How?

33:42.750 --> 33:44.542
Andy, what are you doing here?

33:44.752 --> 33:47.587
You're gonna have
to come with me, Prue.

33:52.844 --> 33:55.216
- I found Matthew.
- I can see.

33:55.429 --> 33:57.386
I need to find Prue and stop her.

33:57.598 --> 34:00.303
No, you're supposed to be after
Piper and Phoebe.

34:00.476 --> 34:03.477
- I don't under...
- I got the power of premonition.

34:03.646 --> 34:06.896
With it, I saw the eldest
working on the curse.

34:07.107 --> 34:09.313
- Help me find her.
- No.

34:09.485 --> 34:12.355
No, no, this is no time
to be distracted.

34:12.529 --> 34:14.438
You must stay on track.

34:14.614 --> 34:16.690
You must obtain the last power.

34:16.909 --> 34:19.234
But the curse will end me.

34:19.411 --> 34:21.949
They brought Melinda Warren
back from the dead to do it.

34:22.164 --> 34:24.869
- They did what?
- I will not go back to oblivion.

34:25.083 --> 34:26.992
Listen.

34:27.168 --> 34:28.627
Just listen to me.

34:29.087 --> 34:31.578
If they're planning to send you back,

34:31.757 --> 34:33.464
they'll have to cast the spell
at home.

34:33.632 --> 34:35.341
So?

34:35.510 --> 34:37.254
So Prue will have to return there
to do it.

34:37.469 --> 34:39.510
Which is where you can thwart her...

34:39.681 --> 34:41.719
...and then gain the power to freeze.

34:41.933 --> 34:45.467
I've already tried.
They'd rather die than give me that.

34:55.780 --> 34:58.152
Try again.

35:06.540 --> 35:10.408
Now, for the last time, Prue,
why the feather?

35:10.628 --> 35:13.000
I told you, I already had it
from before.

35:13.214 --> 35:14.293
Before what?

35:15.049 --> 35:17.587
You can say it, "Before breaking
and entering the museum,"

35:17.760 --> 35:19.966
which, of course, you did
after you obstructed justice.

35:20.429 --> 35:22.505
How did I obstruct justice?

35:22.723 --> 35:24.597
Come on. Don't play dumb.
I know you too well.

35:24.767 --> 35:26.344
You're in a lot of trouble here.

35:26.518 --> 35:28.844
Trouble which I can't help you out of
unless you help me.

35:29.062 --> 35:32.266
- Maybe I should talk to a lawyer.
- You really wanna go there?

35:32.441 --> 35:35.561
You really want me to arrest you,
is that it?

35:35.736 --> 35:39.650
What's the matter with you, Prue?
This isn't a game.

35:39.865 --> 35:41.323
This is very serious.

35:41.533 --> 35:43.822
Andy, please, you have to let me go.

35:44.286 --> 35:46.112
No.

35:46.288 --> 35:48.031
I can't look the other way
anymore, Prue.

35:48.248 --> 35:50.869
This isn't just me.
It's Piper and Phoebe.

35:51.084 --> 35:52.412
Just tell me what's going on.

35:52.585 --> 35:55.456
For once in your life,
will you just trust me?

35:56.172 --> 35:57.797
It's your only choice, Prue.

35:58.007 --> 36:00.130
Andy, I'm sorry,
but I really have to go.

36:00.552 --> 36:03.885
No, you can't. Prue...

36:06.182 --> 36:09.931
Prue, get back here.
You don't know what you're doing!

36:16.234 --> 36:18.855
We're ready now.
All we need is the feather.

36:19.028 --> 36:20.937
And Prue. What's keeping her?
You don't think...?

36:21.113 --> 36:23.651
No, she should be fine.
Matthew already copied her power.

36:23.824 --> 36:25.781
Besides, I sent him to the zoo.

36:25.951 --> 36:28.027
She's probably stuck in traffic.

36:28.204 --> 36:31.240
When she returns, we'll add
the feather and seek out Matthew.

36:31.457 --> 36:33.615
Do you think he's gonna
be hard to find?

36:33.792 --> 36:35.951
Not at all.

36:36.420 --> 36:39.670
I've waited too long
for this moment to hide.

36:39.882 --> 36:43.416
This is our battle, Matthew.
Leave them alone.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.251
I will have what I came for.

36:48.432 --> 36:51.468
Your powers and your death.

36:51.685 --> 36:52.965
Piper!

36:53.478 --> 36:55.934
- Freeze me, witch.
- In your dreams.

36:56.106 --> 36:57.766
I said, freeze me.

36:58.275 --> 36:59.769
Save yourself.

37:00.569 --> 37:03.439
No? Then save your sister.

37:03.613 --> 37:05.985
- Phoebe!
- Save yourself.

37:08.410 --> 37:10.532
Give me that feather.

37:21.005 --> 37:22.334
Piper, now.

37:24.300 --> 37:27.217
<i>Outside of time, outside of gain</i>

37:27.553 --> 37:31.337
<i>Know only sorrow, know only pain</i>

37:32.266 --> 37:34.472
- No!
- It's what you deserve!

37:34.685 --> 37:37.721
This is not the end!

37:48.198 --> 37:50.689
Yes, it is.

37:51.535 --> 37:53.409
This is for eternity.

37:58.458 --> 38:02.123
- I followed him, he failed.
- Bloody hell.

38:02.295 --> 38:03.494
What do we do now?

38:04.756 --> 38:06.879
I don't know.

38:07.050 --> 38:09.126
We're gonna have to think
of something fast, though.

38:09.302 --> 38:12.505
He's gonna be none too pleased
to learn that we have failed.

38:12.681 --> 38:14.507
It wasn't a complete failure, right?

38:14.724 --> 38:18.140
I mean, we outed them,
proved they're the Charmed Ones.

38:18.311 --> 38:19.592
I mean, that has to count.

38:19.938 --> 38:22.263
It'll buy us a little bit of time,
but precious little.

38:22.440 --> 38:23.721
You should've listened to me.

38:23.942 --> 38:26.563
We should've taken care
of them ourselves.

38:26.736 --> 38:29.523
Yeah. You're right, Hannah.

38:29.697 --> 38:31.654
We should've done.

38:34.619 --> 38:37.288
You're gonna wake a judge up
at this hour? Are you nuts?

38:37.455 --> 38:39.780
I'm getting an arrest warrant, Morris.
End of discussion.

38:39.957 --> 38:41.831
Based on what?

38:42.585 --> 38:44.412
Stealing a feather?

38:44.629 --> 38:47.665
He'll bust your rank. You'll be cleaning
out parking meters for a living.

38:47.882 --> 38:49.506
So I should just let it go, is that it?

38:49.675 --> 38:52.083
What about evading arrest?
Am I supposed to let that go too?

38:52.303 --> 38:54.461
Damn right.
Unless you wanna tell the judge

38:54.638 --> 38:58.054
exactly how that little lady
got away from you.

38:58.225 --> 39:00.930
By the way, exactly how did
she get away from you?

39:01.145 --> 39:03.932
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Trudeau.

39:04.106 --> 39:08.186
Take my advice. Let it go.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.816
Don't embarrass yourself.

39:20.247 --> 39:22.654
Leo? You're here.
Why are you here?

39:22.874 --> 39:26.077
I thought I'd work on the plumbing
in the downstairs bathroom.

39:26.294 --> 39:27.670
Oh, now's not really a good time.

39:27.837 --> 39:30.838
We're getting our cousin Melinda
ready to go away.

39:31.007 --> 39:33.498
Can you come back later?
Like, tomorrow?

39:33.718 --> 39:36.589
- Sure. No problem.
- Leo?

39:37.180 --> 39:38.259
Yeah?

39:39.140 --> 39:41.465
Would you like to go out sometime?

39:41.643 --> 39:43.053
With me, that is?

39:43.686 --> 39:45.478
I'd love to.

39:45.646 --> 39:48.517
- Give me a call.
- Okay.

39:54.614 --> 39:57.650
- Who was it?
- It was Leo.

39:57.867 --> 40:00.405
- Is he gone?
- We're perfectly safe.

40:00.578 --> 40:02.570
Then let's begin.

40:03.706 --> 40:06.078
- We can't take those back.
- Why not?

40:07.167 --> 40:09.919
Because that means you're leaving.

40:10.087 --> 40:13.123
- But I have to go.
- Why?

40:13.298 --> 40:16.798
Why can't you stay here and have
the life that you should've had?

40:17.010 --> 40:20.095
Because this isn't my time.
It's your time.

40:20.264 --> 40:22.221
And Prue's and Piper's.

40:22.683 --> 40:24.592
We don't mind sharing.

40:26.436 --> 40:28.927
You three give me great joy.

40:29.898 --> 40:32.021
I've seen the Charmed Ones.

40:32.192 --> 40:36.653
Good witches,
women of strength and grace.

40:43.411 --> 40:44.740
Tell me what you see.

40:49.918 --> 40:52.325
I see the future.

40:52.503 --> 40:57.379
Many more generations
of my beautiful daughters.

40:59.051 --> 41:01.424
I see my dreams fulfilled.

41:02.346 --> 41:04.422
Oh, thank you for that.

41:24.243 --> 41:26.070
<i>Melinda Warren</i>

41:26.245 --> 41:28.486
<i>Blood of our blood, we release you</i>

41:31.708 --> 41:34.745
Blessed be, my daughters.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.245
I love you.

41:50.894 --> 41:52.886
I'm gonna miss her.

41:53.730 --> 41:55.272
Me too.

41:57.275 --> 41:59.600
We can always bring her back.
