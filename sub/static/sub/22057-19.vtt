Previously onHawaii Five-O:This is a setup.

00:03.786 --> 00:05.396
I mean, you guys
get an anonymous tip, then you

00:05.440 --> 00:06.919
pull Adam over,
and you find a dead body

00:06.963 --> 00:08.225
in the trunk of his car?

00:08.269 --> 00:09.705
It's not just any
dead body.

00:09.748 --> 00:10.880
It's Hideki Tashiro.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.577
ADAM:
My task force
was committed

00:12.621 --> 00:14.057
to finding the person
who murdered

00:14.101 --> 00:15.058
Agent Fischer and his family.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.494
My intel suggested that it

00:16.538 --> 00:18.714
wasn't Hideki;
it was someone above him.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.237
A new player
pulling the strings.

00:20.281 --> 00:21.717
Who?

00:21.760 --> 00:23.153
I don't know yet.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.242
When the M.E. was
conducting the autopsy

00:25.286 --> 00:28.419
on Hideki's body, they
found some foreign DNA,

00:28.463 --> 00:31.640
and it did turn up a
familial match-- to you.

00:31.683 --> 00:34.251
We also know the sample
came from a female.

00:34.295 --> 00:35.992
Adam, you understand what
all this means, right?

00:36.036 --> 00:37.428
I have a half-sister.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.169
And somehow she's involved

00:39.213 --> 00:40.997
in everything that's
been going on.

Hello, Mr. Davis.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.612
Sorry to keep you waiting.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.184
STEVE:
I'm sorry, just...

02:21.228 --> 02:23.404
you said what

02:23.447 --> 02:24.492
Seventeen.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.755
STEVE:
17 fire code violations?

You sure about that?

02:28.017 --> 02:29.192
STEVE: I don't...
That doesn't make

02:29.236 --> 02:30.672
any sense.
How... What do you mean?

02:30.715 --> 02:32.239
Yeah, are we talking
about the same place?

02:32.282 --> 02:35.067
Chinatown, small little
Italian restaurant? Very small.

02:35.111 --> 02:36.243
The one you're trying
to renovate?

02:36.286 --> 02:37.418
Yeah.
Yes.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.071
STEVE: You mean small
infractions, right?

02:39.115 --> 02:40.943
Like... like a dead battery

02:42.640 --> 02:44.338
a thing over it or whatever?

02:44.381 --> 02:46.557
Well, those are both issues,
but you've got bigger problems,

02:46.601 --> 02:48.080
starting with
your electrical work.

02:48.124 --> 02:50.213
Whoa. What-what-what's wrong
with the electrical system?

02:50.257 --> 02:51.562
For one thing,
your breaker panel's

02:51.606 --> 02:53.042
dangerously overloaded.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.436
You've got open splices
in the ceiling,

02:55.479 --> 02:56.872
frayed wires
in the weather-head.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.221
It's a mess.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.788
I don't know what to say.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.529
You know whose fault this is?

03:01.572 --> 03:03.095
Yes, I do-- Uncle Vito.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.097
Yours, not Uncle Vito's.
Your fault.

03:05.141 --> 03:06.577
What do you mean, mine?

03:06.621 --> 03:08.362
Uncle Vito has been
systematically trying

03:08.405 --> 03:10.015
to destroy our dream
since he landed here.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.234
How is this
my fault?

03:11.278 --> 03:12.279
DANNY:
Well, it's your
fault because

03:12.322 --> 03:13.758
you gave him the number to use

03:13.802 --> 03:15.107
for the electrician.
That's why it's your fault.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.413
He's a great guy,
and he's-he's a great...

03:16.457 --> 03:18.110
Look at the... look at the work
he did in here.

03:18.154 --> 03:19.416
This place was
torn apart by bullets.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.549
Look at it--
it's perfect.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.246
Excuse me.
Did you say

03:23.290 --> 03:27.207
the same electricians also did
the work on these offices?

03:27.250 --> 03:28.991
What?

03:29.034 --> 03:30.601
Was that work permitted?

03:30.645 --> 03:33.256
He'll tell you.Well, I mean...

03:33.300 --> 03:35.215
FIRE INSPECTOR:
I think I need to look around.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.261
Are you stupid?
What's the matter with you?

03:38.305 --> 03:40.263
It just came out. I...When your brain stops working,

03:40.307 --> 03:41.438
you should shut your mouth.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.485
Hi.
Hi. Please...

03:44.528 --> 03:45.834
please tell me you have
something to, uh,

03:45.877 --> 03:47.444
take me away
from this situation.

03:47.488 --> 03:48.967
Actually, yeah, I do.
There's a man downstairs

03:49.011 --> 03:50.055
who wants to talk to you.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.840
All right. We know
what it's about?

03:51.883 --> 03:53.755
Saying it's about your father.

03:53.798 --> 03:56.192
My father?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.280
DAVIS:
You had yourself

03:57.324 --> 03:59.239
quite a career, didn't you?

03:59.282 --> 04:01.545
Yeah, it was something.
I mean, I'm just proud

04:01.589 --> 04:03.504
I was able to serve
my country, you know?

04:03.547 --> 04:04.635
It was an honor.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.550
How about you, Mr. Davis?

04:07.595 --> 04:08.639
Leroy.

04:08.683 --> 04:09.814
Okay.

04:09.858 --> 04:12.469
I... I did one tour in Vietnam.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.515
Oh, is that how
you knew my father?

04:14.558 --> 04:16.212
No, sir.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.214
You guys work together?

04:20.912 --> 04:24.829
I guess you could say
we knew each other through work.

04:24.873 --> 04:27.354
But did we
work together?

04:27.397 --> 04:29.573
No.

04:31.096 --> 04:34.448
I was employed by the
Hawaiian Syndicate

04:34.491 --> 04:36.841
in the '70s and '80s.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.937
I'm sorry, did you just, uh...

04:45.981 --> 04:49.201
did you just tell me you were
involved in organized crime?

04:49.245 --> 04:51.291
I painted houses.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.162
Not literally, of course.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.685
I know what the term means.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.252
You were a hit man?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.471
That's right.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.386
And yet somehow
you're sitting in my office

04:59.429 --> 05:02.171
instead of a six-by-eight cell
somewhere. How's that?

05:02.214 --> 05:04.216
I was very careful.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.348
Mmm.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.176
It also helped
that there were

05:07.219 --> 05:08.873
so many corrupt cops

05:08.917 --> 05:11.136
during the years
that I was active.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.574
The guys that weren't,
well, they were

05:13.617 --> 05:15.880
too scared to
come after me.

05:15.924 --> 05:18.274
Except for one.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.102
My father.

05:20.145 --> 05:22.496
Day I met him...

05:22.539 --> 05:25.368
I knew he was going
to be trouble.

05:33.028 --> 05:36.292
[chatter continues;

06:08.193 --> 06:10.108
Next one's in you.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.374
Hey!

06:14.417 --> 06:15.723
You hear what I said?

06:15.766 --> 06:17.333
Yeah.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.943
And I don't doubt
you're telling the truth.

06:18.987 --> 06:20.423
You already killed
one cop this week.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.294
You seem to think you know
something about me.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.296
My name's John McGarrett.

06:24.340 --> 06:27.082
Detective John McGarrett.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.953
I'm the guy that's going
to put you in jail

06:28.997 --> 06:30.128
for the rest of your life.

06:30.172 --> 06:32.957
I guess he was wrong about that.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.307
He was right about the
other thing, though.

06:35.351 --> 06:39.399
I did kill Detective Ozuki
earlier that week.

06:39.442 --> 06:43.098
All this that you're telling me,
if all of this is true...

06:43.141 --> 06:45.143
why you coming forward now?

06:45.187 --> 06:47.798
I'm an old man.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.497
Been carrying this
around long enough.

06:51.846 --> 06:55.153
If your father was here,
I'd be doing this with him.

06:55.197 --> 06:59.462
But since he's not,
well, I figure...

06:59.506 --> 07:02.334
you're the next best option.

07:02.378 --> 07:04.293
So...

07:11.518 --> 07:14.129
Shall we get on with it?

07:16.523 --> 07:18.916
Go on. Open it.

07:30.972 --> 07:33.409
How'd you get this
past my security?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.802
Like I said,

07:34.845 --> 07:36.499
I'm very careful.

07:36.543 --> 07:37.848
Are these yours?

07:37.892 --> 07:39.415
They were.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.505
But now they're evidence.

07:42.549 --> 07:45.247
Commander McGarrett,
I'd like to confess

07:45.290 --> 07:49.773
to the murder
of Detective Jake Ozuki.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.864
And 17 others.

Commander, say it.

08:45.873 --> 08:48.571
Whatever it is
you're doing today...

08:50.007 --> 08:52.140
I don't know whether you're
trying to make amends

08:52.183 --> 08:54.142
or you're looking for
some kind of atonement...

08:55.709 --> 08:57.667
...but if that's it,
you're way off.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.277

on this island, why this one?

11:57.368 --> 11:59.414
Remote, of course.

12:01.285 --> 12:04.636
But still plenty
of access to the roads.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.771
And the earth is soft.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.642
Mmm. Uh...

12:11.731 --> 12:13.428
Up top.

12:28.269 --> 12:29.923
This is it.

12:30.967 --> 12:34.057
Buried the first body here.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.028
Hey, Noelani, listen.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.465
I just sent you
a dropped location pin

12:50.508 --> 12:52.467
from the Ewa Forest Reserve.

12:52.510 --> 12:55.122
I need you to get out here
as quickly as possible.

12:55.165 --> 12:57.298
Bring a bunch of people.
We need to exhume a body.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.952
Make sure they bring plenty
of shovels.

12:58.995 --> 13:01.345
There's six more buried here.

13:03.130 --> 13:06.176
Bring as many people as you can.

13:07.177 --> 13:08.439
Yeah.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.180
Thank you.

13:13.923 --> 13:15.795
Six more, you say?

13:17.013 --> 13:18.319
Well, that makes seven.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.408
You said there were 18 bodies
altogether.

13:20.451 --> 13:21.583
There are.

13:21.626 --> 13:24.499
They're not all buried here.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.370
Where are they?

13:27.676 --> 13:29.634
Patience, John.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.375
Patience.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.988
What did you say?
What did you just say?

13:39.731 --> 13:43.779
I said have patience.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.065
Inside.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.899
♪

14:24.037 --> 14:25.734
Move.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.520
Gonna go out on a limb here
and say

14:29.564 --> 14:32.306
this is not an
official FBI meeting.

14:32.349 --> 14:34.090
That's a good guess.

14:34.134 --> 14:36.092
So what is this?

14:36.136 --> 14:38.878
You still convinced
I'm the one behind it all?

14:38.921 --> 14:40.705
The gang violence,
the hit on Fischer,

14:40.749 --> 14:42.533
the attack on the warehouse?
What, are you gonna...

14:42.577 --> 14:44.753
you gonna force a confession
out of me

14:44.796 --> 14:46.059
WOMAN:
Don't be ridiculous.

14:46.102 --> 14:49.453
He knows you had nothing
to do with any of that.

14:50.541 --> 14:53.196
Hello, Adam.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.458
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

14:54.502 --> 14:55.459
No.

14:55.503 --> 14:56.852
But I know you.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.549
We've never met, of course,
but you've been

14:58.593 --> 15:00.725
a presence in my life
since I was a child.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.946
I always knew one day
we'd come face-to-face.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.643
I just never imagined

15:05.687 --> 15:08.429
it would be under
these circumstances.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.344
Then again,
life is unpredictable.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.693
Wouldn't you agree?

15:11.736 --> 15:14.130
Yeah, I would.

15:14.174 --> 15:17.829
I mean, I for one never
knew I had a sister.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.789
So you know who I am.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.965
I was only recently made aware.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.141
Must have come as quite a shock.

15:25.185 --> 15:26.969
Yeah, it did.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.450
But you're not just
my sister, are you?

15:29.493 --> 15:32.235
You're also the one I've
been after this whole time.

15:32.279 --> 15:34.020
The one who killed
Agent Fischer.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.804
That's right.

15:35.847 --> 15:39.112
Brother, you and I have led
very different lives.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.941
You were given everything.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.551
I learned
from an early age,

15:43.594 --> 15:45.945
if I want something,
I have to take it.

15:45.988 --> 15:50.775
And if anyone gets in my way,
if anyone even poses a threat...

15:54.170 --> 15:55.258
I have to eliminate them.

15:55.302 --> 15:56.781
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.009
Please,

16:07.053 --> 16:08.619
make yourself
comfortable.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.970
We have much to catch up on.

16:33.905 --> 16:36.691
I was eight when I discovered
my father had another family.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.954
That I had two brothers.

16:41.391 --> 16:44.090
I was ten when I realized
I was never going to meet them.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.093
Our father
would make sure of that.

16:49.704 --> 16:52.750
My mother and I were
his dirty little secret.

16:52.794 --> 16:55.666
And he intended
to keep it that way.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.147
So he kept me
in the shadows.

16:58.191 --> 17:01.585
For much of my life,
that was painful.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.892
But it turns out,
in my line of work,

17:03.935 --> 17:06.286
being in the shadows
has its advantages.

17:07.374 --> 17:08.940
Of course,
thanks to Agent McNeal,

17:08.984 --> 17:11.030
those advantages are now lost.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.510
What exactly did he do?

17:15.121 --> 17:17.732
Tell me something--
how did you learn about me?

17:19.560 --> 17:22.867
Your DNA was found
on Hideki Tashiro's body.

17:22.911 --> 17:26.175
When they ran it, it came back
a familial match to mine.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.394
That's right.

17:28.395 --> 17:29.787
Thing is, I didn't kill Hideki.

17:29.831 --> 17:33.791
I gave the order, yes,
but I didn't pull the trigger.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.880
In fact, I hadn't even been
in the same room

17:35.924 --> 17:37.447
with the man in several weeks,

17:37.491 --> 17:41.060
so there's only one way my DNA
could have ended up there.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.278
It was planted.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.280
By someone who had
access to both me

17:44.324 --> 17:46.065
and the lab where
the testing was done.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.109
But why would he do that?

17:47.153 --> 17:50.547
Leverage

17:50.591 --> 17:53.202
Agent McNeal no doubt wanted
the upper hand

17:53.246 --> 17:54.247
in our future dealings.

17:54.290 --> 17:55.552
I'm sure he would
have offered

17:55.596 --> 17:58.468
to make the evidence go away
for a price.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.732
Unfortunately for him,
I discovered his betrayal.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.343
Unfortunately for me,

18:03.386 --> 18:06.128
I've now been exposed,
which means I need to disappear.

18:06.172 --> 18:09.827
But such a feat
takes resources.

18:09.871 --> 18:11.742
Resources you will provide.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.222
I don't understand.

18:13.266 --> 18:14.963
The money, Adam.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.747
Michelle Shioma's
20 million.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.923
You're gonna get it
and hand it over.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.100
I already went over this
with Hideki.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.102
I-I don't know
how many more times...

18:23.145 --> 18:25.974
Hideki is gullible and weak.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.455
You'll find I'm neither.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.555
Do you recognize
this place?

18:43.296 --> 18:45.124
No. Should I?

18:45.167 --> 18:47.517
It's a motel
in Amarillo, Texas.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.303
How do you know
where my wife is?

18:50.346 --> 18:51.521
Is that important?

18:51.565 --> 18:53.871
What matters is I have
people there right now

18:53.915 --> 18:55.612
waiting to hear from me.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.224
As are my men in San Francisco.

18:58.267 --> 19:01.792
You'll be happy to know
that Chin Ho, Abby and Sara

19:01.836 --> 19:05.622
had a nice breakfast at the
Seven Seas Diner this morning.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.450
Chin doesn't think
it holds a candle

19:07.494 --> 19:10.323
to the Wailana Coffee House,
but Sara loves it.

19:10.366 --> 19:11.802
Sweet little girl.

19:11.846 --> 19:14.457
I also know about your C.I.All right.

19:14.501 --> 19:15.676
You've made your point.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.547
But how many more times
can I say this?

19:17.591 --> 19:20.550
You have six hours
to get me the money.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.639
If I were you, I wouldn't
waste any more time

19:22.683 --> 19:24.467
standing here lying to me.

19:28.384 --> 19:29.733
MAN:
Hey.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.608
You heard the lady.

19:39.526 --> 19:40.831
GROVER:
Got an updated report

19:40.875 --> 19:42.137
on the guns in the briefcase.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.530
Leroy's prints
are all over the place,

19:43.573 --> 19:45.227
including the magazines.

19:45.271 --> 19:46.794
The iron's definitely his.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.317
Where are we at with ballistics?

19:48.361 --> 19:49.623
In the works.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.712
Tani's over at HPD
pulling files on everyone

19:51.755 --> 19:54.018
who went missing
during Leroy's active years.

19:54.062 --> 19:56.760
You know, just in case
the old bastard

19:56.804 --> 19:58.588
can't remember all
of his victims.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.329
Keep me posted, all right?

20:00.373 --> 20:01.722
Yeah.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.293
Turn here.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.773
It's on the right.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.491
You okay?

20:31.534 --> 20:33.884
I've been here before.

20:38.193 --> 20:39.629
How long you lived here?

20:41.283 --> 20:43.198
Since '82.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.374
I bought this
right after I got married.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.115
Raised my kids
in this house.

20:47.158 --> 20:48.290
That pergola...

20:48.334 --> 20:50.858
wasn't always
there, was it?

20:52.860 --> 20:54.514
How do you know that?

20:59.997 --> 21:02.609
This is only gonna
take a second.

21:16.362 --> 21:20.366
My dad used to drive me home
from school this way a lot.

21:20.409 --> 21:23.107
Guess he was
keeping tabs on me.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.935
Can't say I'm surprised.

21:24.979 --> 21:28.809
Like I said, your old man--
he was relentless.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.600
How's it going?

21:37.644 --> 21:39.254
Well, he's been taking
a bunch of notes

21:39.298 --> 21:40.299
and shaking his head

21:40.342 --> 21:41.952
and frowning a lot.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.954
So I'm gonna go
with: "not well."

21:43.998 --> 21:45.304
Well, they all do that.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.872
Maybe it's not that bad.

21:48.916 --> 21:51.962
You know, some people have
naturally dour disposition.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.834
I'm gonna go talk to him.

21:54.878 --> 21:56.184
Aloha.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.273
Welcome to Five-O.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.579
I'm Captain Lou Grover.

21:59.622 --> 22:01.494
How you doing, buddy?
What's the good word?

22:01.537 --> 22:04.410
This place is a death trap.Huh?

22:04.453 --> 22:08.022
You've got hundreds of feet
of exposed wires in the walls.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.937
This gun cabinet needs to be

22:09.980 --> 22:12.809
at least 18 inches
from an overhead sprinkler.

22:12.853 --> 22:15.159
And then there's
the ventilation system.

22:15.203 --> 22:16.509
What's wrong with the
ventilation system?

22:16.552 --> 22:18.859
Looks like it hasn't
been cleaned in years.

22:18.902 --> 22:20.034
He's right.

22:20.077 --> 22:21.165
No one's been up there

22:21.209 --> 22:22.515
since the Russians
pumped that...

22:22.558 --> 22:25.692
Would you shut it?
Listen, um, Inspector, uh...

22:25.735 --> 22:27.389
Romero.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.956
Uh, this is an old building.

22:28.999 --> 22:31.698
Now, come on. It's been around
since the 1800s.

22:31.741 --> 22:35.571
I'm sure you could, you know,
kind of grandfather that in.

22:35.615 --> 22:36.833
You're funny.

22:36.877 --> 22:40.707
I need to go count
your fire extinguishers now.

22:42.970 --> 22:45.102
We even have fire extinguishers?

22:45.146 --> 22:46.495
Depends.

22:46.539 --> 22:49.063
Do we count the one
that Danny uses as a doorstop?

22:55.461 --> 22:57.288
We need to talk.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.380
JESSIE:
Well, this is just great.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.120
Your half-sister's daddy issues

23:03.164 --> 23:04.948
turned her
into a stone cold psycho,

23:04.992 --> 23:07.473
and now anyone connected to you
is in her crosshairs.

23:07.516 --> 23:09.475
I'm going to fix that.

23:10.563 --> 23:11.738
All right, Jessie,
I'm sorry.

23:11.781 --> 23:12.869
This operation,

23:12.913 --> 23:14.305
what I've asked you to do--

23:14.349 --> 23:16.482
if I knew it would
have come to this...

23:16.525 --> 23:19.006
It's not your fault.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.964
Just tell me
what our next move is.

23:21.008 --> 23:23.227
I assume you have a plan?Yeah.

23:23.271 --> 23:25.491
It's simple--
I go get the money.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.581
Okay. How?

23:28.624 --> 23:31.801
You know some other rich dude
you can extort for 20 million?

23:31.845 --> 23:34.195
Preferably someone who won't
decide to eat a bullet first.

23:34.238 --> 23:36.240
No, that won't
be necessary.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.329
I know where the money is.

23:38.373 --> 23:40.070
What?

23:40.114 --> 23:42.029
Shioma's money?

23:42.072 --> 23:43.509
You know where that is?

23:43.552 --> 23:45.206
Yeah.

23:45.249 --> 23:47.338
Have you known this whole time?

23:47.382 --> 23:48.688
Yes.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.429
I gave you a beat-down
and watched Hideki

23:50.472 --> 23:52.648
put a gun to your head
and almost pull the trigger.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.520
Why the hell
didn't you hand it over then?

23:54.563 --> 23:56.086
Because handing over that money

23:56.130 --> 23:58.262
would have created a whole
other set of problems.

23:58.306 --> 23:59.655
Problems a thousand times worse

23:59.699 --> 24:01.483
than owing a debt
to Hideki Tashiro.

24:01.527 --> 24:03.267
And now?Now I have no choice.

24:03.311 --> 24:04.965
People I care about
are in danger,

24:05.008 --> 24:07.097
and I have no other options.

24:08.142 --> 24:09.360
All right.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.101
Let's do this.
Not us.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.494
You're staying here.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.017
Chivalry.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.671
That's sweet.

24:15.715 --> 24:17.281
But you and I
started this thing together,

24:17.325 --> 24:18.935
and we're gonna end it
the same way.

24:21.329 --> 24:21.938
Okay.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.685
♪

24:45.484 --> 24:46.572
Hey.

24:46.615 --> 24:48.008
Got any family left
on this island?

24:48.051 --> 24:49.009
You're looking at 'em.

24:51.098 --> 24:53.883
My wife passed on
ten years ago.

24:53.927 --> 24:55.189
Kids moved
to the mainland.

24:55.232 --> 24:57.104
Haven't been back since.

25:04.372 --> 25:06.505
Yeah, Junior, what do you got?

25:07.593 --> 25:08.637
We've exhumed two bodies.

25:08.681 --> 25:10.726
GPR confirms five more.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.773
Each one was buried
exactly where Mr. Davis said.

25:13.816 --> 25:14.948
All right, do me a favor.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.558
Have the lab run that DNA,
all right?

25:16.602 --> 25:18.995
We need I.D.'s on these people
as soon as possible.

25:19.039 --> 25:20.214
Actually, sir, it looks like

25:20.257 --> 25:22.433
we already have an I.D.
on one of them.

25:22.477 --> 25:23.478
Which one?

25:25.045 --> 25:28.614
Badge number confirms,
HPD Detective Jake Ozuki.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.572
The badge was found
with the remains.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.139
All right, just, uh,
get back to me

25:32.182 --> 25:34.489
with the other I.D.'s
as soon as possible, all right?

25:34.533 --> 25:35.882
You got it.Thank you.

25:38.362 --> 25:40.321
You mind if we
make a quick stop

25:40.364 --> 25:42.845
by my neighbor's
before we move on?

25:44.891 --> 25:46.327
LEROY:
Hey.

25:46.370 --> 25:47.720
Here you go.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.373
These are my babies.Okay.

26:16.270 --> 26:18.011
Let me ask you
a question.

26:19.055 --> 26:20.970
Why'd you kill Jake Ozuki?

26:21.014 --> 26:22.972
Uh... the cop?

26:23.016 --> 26:26.236
Yeah. What'd he do that
deserved a bullet?

26:27.673 --> 26:32.329
I never asked my employers
why they wanted someone dead.

26:32.373 --> 26:33.940
I just pulled the trigger.

26:33.983 --> 26:35.637
I didn't need a reason.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.987
But with my dad,
you actually had a reason.

26:38.031 --> 26:39.206
Didn't you?

26:39.249 --> 26:41.034
You said so yourself
you had a good reason.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.341
You knew he'd eventually
catch up with you.

26:44.385 --> 26:46.517
However, you let him live. Why?

26:46.561 --> 26:50.783
I only killed
when I was ordered to.

26:50.826 --> 26:54.264
Though I admit,
in the case of your father...

26:55.831 --> 27:00.575
I came very close
to making an exception.

27:10.237 --> 27:12.369
DISPATCH :
Central calling 143.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.633
Detective McGarrett,
do you copy?

27:16.722 --> 27:18.680
This is McGarrett. Over.

27:18.724 --> 27:22.423
Detective, you've got
an urgent request for backup.

27:22.466 --> 27:25.034
Copy. What's the situation?

27:25.078 --> 27:27.036
It's your wife, Doris.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.256
She's going into labor, sir.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.435
I'm on my way.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.877
LEROY:
So, after that night, I...

27:41.921 --> 27:44.793
stopped using the forest
as a dumping ground.

27:47.709 --> 27:50.233
I guess, in a way...

27:50.277 --> 27:53.062
you saved your father's life.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.938
All these folks went missing
during the years

27:58.981 --> 28:01.680
that Leroy Davis was active?TANI: So what we did

28:01.723 --> 28:03.899
is we prioritized the cases
that are linked

28:03.943 --> 28:05.727
to organized crime,
and according to the logs,

28:05.771 --> 28:07.424
John McGarrett looked
into all of them.

28:07.468 --> 28:08.904
And the bodies from the forest?

28:08.948 --> 28:11.646
Yeah, lab found DNA matches
to all seven victims.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.517
Here they are.

28:13.561 --> 28:16.085
Aside from the fact that they
all vanished without a trace,

28:16.129 --> 28:19.741
there appears to be no link
between any of the victims.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.569
Seven people,

28:21.612 --> 28:24.354
each one of them with loved
ones, and then one night,

28:24.398 --> 28:27.053
they just didn't come home,
never to be seen again.

28:27.096 --> 28:29.403
Got 11 more just like
them still out there.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.535
So, what about the
guy who used to run

28:31.579 --> 28:32.841
the Syndicate
back in the day?

28:32.885 --> 28:34.190
What do we know
about him?

28:34.234 --> 28:36.062
The guy that Leroy
answered to,

28:36.105 --> 28:37.280
Gary Kahele.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.021
So, whatever happened to him?

28:39.065 --> 28:42.024
TANI:
Nothing. He's very much
alive and on the island.

28:42.068 --> 28:44.287
But according to HPD, he's been
out of the game for years.

28:44.331 --> 28:47.464
Yeah, well, we need to go pay
Mr. Kahele a little visit,

28:47.508 --> 28:51.860
make sure he knows it's just not
gonna be that easy to walk away.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.174
Afternoon, Mr. Kahele.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.655
Can I help you?

29:04.699 --> 29:07.136
Yeah, you can start by putting
your hands behind your back.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.356
What the hell is this about?This is about

29:09.399 --> 29:11.706
your ordering the murder
of 18 innocent people.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.751
Says who?

29:12.794 --> 29:14.753
Says the guy
who pulled the trigger.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.537
You're coming with us.
Shut your mouth.

29:32.379 --> 29:33.510
Kimura-san.

29:33.554 --> 29:36.905
Adam Noshimuri.It's good to see you.

29:36.949 --> 29:38.689
Yeah. Yes, yes.Hey.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.735
Jessie, this is Mr. Kimura.

29:40.779 --> 29:41.910
He's an old friend
of my father's.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.520
I've known him
since I was a little boy.

29:43.564 --> 29:45.261
How's it going?

29:45.305 --> 29:46.436
Pleasure.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.134
Let me guess.

29:48.177 --> 29:49.831
You're here to see your juniper.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.790
You still have that?

29:51.833 --> 29:54.270
Of course.
I'd be a fool to sell it.

29:54.314 --> 29:56.055
Follow me.

29:59.754 --> 30:02.801
[relaxing Japanese music
playing]

30:02.844 --> 30:06.587
When I was 11, he had me look
after that juniper for a year.

30:07.588 --> 30:09.024
Yamadori.

30:09.068 --> 30:11.331
Very rare.

30:11.374 --> 30:14.464
And quite old.

30:14.508 --> 30:17.859
252 years, to be exact.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.992
Damn.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.124
Yes.

30:22.168 --> 30:24.387
And with proper care,

30:24.431 --> 30:27.434
it should outlive someone
even as young as you.

30:28.478 --> 30:29.915
This thing could die tomorrow,

30:29.958 --> 30:32.047
and there's a good chance
it could still outlive me.

30:32.091 --> 30:35.050
Actually, we're here
on another matter.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.749
Oh?

30:38.793 --> 30:40.273
What is that?

30:40.316 --> 30:42.405
I need to make a withdrawal.

30:44.451 --> 30:46.148
Oh.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.673
I see.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.588
How much?

30:51.632 --> 30:53.634
All of it.

30:57.812 --> 30:59.683
That would be unwise.

30:59.727 --> 31:00.684
I know.

31:00.728 --> 31:03.122
You understand what will happen?

31:04.732 --> 31:06.342
Yes.

31:07.517 --> 31:09.519
As you wish.

31:15.177 --> 31:17.353
All right, spill.

31:17.397 --> 31:19.268
What the hell is this place?

31:20.574 --> 31:23.490
It's sort of an unofficial bank
for the Yakuza.

31:23.533 --> 31:27.102
The only one
that serves all the clans.

31:27.146 --> 31:29.888
Like a normal bank,
Kimura-san accepts deposits,

31:29.931 --> 31:32.325
extends credit, makes loans.

31:32.368 --> 31:34.327
Unlike a normal bank...

31:34.370 --> 31:36.807
Let me guess-- he
also washes money.

31:36.851 --> 31:40.246
Yeah. Among other services.

31:40.289 --> 31:43.075
This operation has been
in his family for generations.

31:43.118 --> 31:45.164
It's been around longer
than the oldest plants in here.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.992
And for good reason.

31:47.035 --> 31:50.821
Kimura-san is loyal,
trustworthy, discreet.

31:50.865 --> 31:52.998
And this is where Shioma
kept the money?

31:54.390 --> 31:56.001
No.

31:59.091 --> 32:01.006
This is where I keep it.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.141
Michelle had it
hidden away on Kauai.

32:06.185 --> 32:08.491
After she died,
I went looking for it.

32:08.535 --> 32:11.016
Didn't take me long
to figure out where it was.

32:11.059 --> 32:14.671
Once I had my hands on it,
I had to put it somewhere safe.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.717
And no one could know about it.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.545
Not McGarrett, not even my wife.

32:18.588 --> 32:19.981
Why?

32:20.025 --> 32:22.331
Because Hideki wasn't the only
gangster looking for it.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.681
If having this money
is so dangerous,

32:24.725 --> 32:26.857
why did you go after
it in the first place?

32:26.901 --> 32:29.512
When my father died,
he left behind certain debts--

32:29.556 --> 32:32.602
financial and otherwise--
to some not-so-nice people.

32:32.646 --> 32:34.474
As long as the money is here,

32:34.517 --> 32:36.867
those people know that
the debts will be paid down.

32:36.911 --> 32:39.131
So, what happens now that
you're taking it out?

32:39.174 --> 32:42.090
Those payments won't get made.

32:42.134 --> 32:44.571
Which will incur
certain penalties.

32:44.614 --> 32:46.747
What kind of penalties?

32:54.624 --> 32:57.584
The money's being arranged.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.238
It shouldn't take long.

33:10.814 --> 33:12.338
All right.

33:18.126 --> 33:19.606
Here.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.789
♪

33:37.406 --> 33:39.713
That was the last one.

33:39.756 --> 33:42.672
You know, Commander,
I must admit,

33:42.716 --> 33:45.110
killing was never easy.

33:45.153 --> 33:49.070
Even when I wore the uniform.

33:49.114 --> 33:51.377
Come on, man.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.640
I don't buy it, Leroy.

33:53.683 --> 33:55.685
Why would I? I mean...

33:55.729 --> 33:58.036
look, if killing
was so unpleasant for you...

33:58.079 --> 34:00.081
Why did I do it for
the Syndicate?

34:00.125 --> 34:01.909
Yeah. Why'd you do it
for the Syndicate?

34:01.952 --> 34:04.042
You know, you're lucky.

34:05.391 --> 34:10.091
You never felt what it was like
to fight for your country

34:10.135 --> 34:13.921
only to come home
and have your country treat you

34:13.964 --> 34:16.097
like the enemy.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.491
See, when I came
back from Vietnam,

34:18.534 --> 34:22.277
nobody wanted to
hire a baby killer.

34:22.321 --> 34:23.844
So I took
the one thing

34:23.887 --> 34:26.238
that the Army taught
me how to do,

34:26.281 --> 34:28.588
and I put it...

34:28.631 --> 34:31.765
I put it to use.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.462
My old man fought
in that same war.

34:33.506 --> 34:34.681
You know that, right?

34:34.724 --> 34:36.291
My old man fought
in that same war,

34:36.335 --> 34:38.511
and he came home
to the same country

34:38.554 --> 34:41.122
and was spat at by the
same people that spat at you.

34:41.166 --> 34:44.082
He didn't go off and become
a professional killer.

34:44.125 --> 34:46.388
So, why don't you save
that story for someone else.

34:46.432 --> 34:48.651
That was your choice.

34:49.870 --> 34:52.351
John was a better
man than me.

34:52.394 --> 34:54.222
Yeah, well...

34:56.529 --> 34:58.444
You ever catch
who killed him?

34:58.487 --> 35:00.315
Yes, I did.
Good.

35:00.359 --> 35:02.535
At least one of
you got your man.

35:15.722 --> 35:17.506
That's all six.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.117
Ready?

35:20.205 --> 35:22.120
Just give me a minute.

35:28.213 --> 35:29.736
Kimura-san.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.003
Thank you for helping me
with this.

35:36.046 --> 35:39.049
Trust me, if there
was any other way...

35:39.093 --> 35:40.834
I understand.

35:42.183 --> 35:43.619
Be careful, Adam.

36:31.754 --> 36:33.147
Yeah.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.975
Have you lost your mind?
What the hell are you doing?

36:35.018 --> 36:36.629
What I probably should have done
weeks ago.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.108
I'm getting out.

36:38.152 --> 36:40.633
In case you forgot, there's now
a contract on my head.

36:40.676 --> 36:42.025
I told you,
as soon as we pay Noriko...

36:42.069 --> 36:43.026
How do you know

36:43.070 --> 36:44.376
she won't kill us anyway

36:44.419 --> 36:45.377
I get that you're scared.

36:45.420 --> 36:46.552
I am, too.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.336
But if you run,
she will find you.

36:48.380 --> 36:49.903
Take it from someone
who's gone into hiding--

36:49.946 --> 36:51.774
the world is a lot smaller
than you think.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.036
You'll never be safe.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.299
You need to trust me, Jessie.

36:54.342 --> 36:55.343
Turn the car around.

36:55.387 --> 36:56.823
I did trust you.

36:56.866 --> 36:58.041
Look where it got me.

36:58.085 --> 36:59.739
Jessie, you do this,
and my family dies.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.088
Do you get that?

37:01.131 --> 37:02.916
They're cops, right?

37:02.959 --> 37:04.222
They can handle themselves.

37:04.265 --> 37:05.223
Jessie, please.

37:05.266 --> 37:06.485
I'm sorry.

37:09.096 --> 37:10.358
Please, Jessie.

37:10.402 --> 37:12.578
Jessie!

37:15.929 --> 37:17.235
Adam, hey.ADAM: Hey. I'm trying

37:17.278 --> 37:19.237
to get a hold of McGarrett.
Are you with him?

37:19.280 --> 37:21.195
No, he's working a case.
Why

37:21.239 --> 37:22.936
I need you to track
a cell for me.

37:22.979 --> 37:23.937
Is everything okay?

37:23.980 --> 37:25.025
No.

37:32.075 --> 37:33.729
We can take him
from here, Steve.

37:39.387 --> 37:41.911
I think it's
something your father

37:41.955 --> 37:43.870
would have enjoyed doing.

37:45.611 --> 37:49.571
Leroy Davis, you're under
arrest for murder.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.573
You have the right to
remain silent. Anything you say

37:51.617 --> 37:54.359
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

37:54.402 --> 37:55.664
Hello, John.

37:58.798 --> 37:59.973
Is today the day?

38:00.016 --> 38:02.323
No.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.369
Then what can I do for you?

38:04.412 --> 38:06.545
STEVE: If you can't
afford an attorney,

38:06.588 --> 38:09.069
one will be provided for you
at government expense.

38:09.112 --> 38:10.940
Thank you.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.072
You're welcome.

38:12.115 --> 38:13.334
Let's go.

38:16.729 --> 38:18.818
Hey. Hey, Leroy?

38:21.211 --> 38:23.039
It wasn't just
because of my father

38:23.083 --> 38:24.606
you did all this, was it?

38:24.650 --> 38:26.304
No.

38:26.347 --> 38:27.827
I did it for Jack.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.657
Jake. You mean Jake Ozuki.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.223
No.

38:33.267 --> 38:35.182
I mean Jack.

38:35.225 --> 38:37.227
Jake's son.

38:38.751 --> 38:41.362
I never forgot his name.

38:42.668 --> 38:45.497
Your father made sure of that.

38:49.022 --> 38:51.894
JOHN:
Know who that is?

38:53.331 --> 38:54.767
Can't say that I do.

38:56.856 --> 38:59.424
That's Jake Ozuki's family.

39:00.512 --> 39:02.818
You know, the
detective you killed?

39:02.862 --> 39:04.690
That's his wife, Linda.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.475
And his son, Jack.

39:07.519 --> 39:11.392
They come here every year on
the anniversary of Jake's death.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.133
Talk about everything
that's happened

39:13.176 --> 39:15.570
in their lives over
the past year.

39:15.614 --> 39:18.051
Trouble is...

39:18.094 --> 39:20.749
they're visiting an empty grave.

39:22.142 --> 39:24.362
But you already knew that.

39:27.321 --> 39:30.280
What's the point of this, John?

39:30.324 --> 39:33.545
Every murder has two victims:

39:33.588 --> 39:36.374
the deceased...

39:36.417 --> 39:38.985
and the family
left in the wake.

39:55.697 --> 39:57.699
DOCTOR:
Mr. Davis has

39:57.743 --> 39:59.397
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.529
It's a rare brain disorder,

40:01.573 --> 40:03.618
characterized
by rapidly progressive dementia.

40:03.662 --> 40:06.404
And what's the prognosis
on something like this?

40:06.447 --> 40:09.189
The condition
is invariably fatal.

40:09.232 --> 40:12.453
I estimate he has
three to six months.

40:13.846 --> 40:15.413
All right.
Thank you very much, Doctor.

40:15.456 --> 40:16.979
I really...
I really appreciate your time.

40:17.023 --> 40:18.633
Of course.All right, thanks.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.204
Commander?

40:24.247 --> 40:25.684
Yeah, just...

40:25.727 --> 40:28.164
Sorry, I just noticed
the picture.

40:28.208 --> 40:30.515
"Jack." Is that your boy?

40:30.558 --> 40:31.690
Yes.

40:31.733 --> 40:33.866
He was six when
he drew that.

40:33.909 --> 40:35.694
STEVE:
That's nice.

40:35.737 --> 40:37.260
Thank you.

40:37.304 --> 40:39.393
NOELANI: I've identified
all the remains.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.569
HPD has notified the families.

40:41.613 --> 40:43.615
Well, I, uh...

40:43.658 --> 40:46.400
Thank you. I know how
much work went into this.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.836
You don't need to thank me,
Commander.

40:47.880 --> 40:48.968
The families of these victims

40:49.011 --> 40:50.970
have been waiting years
for answers.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.321
I don't want them
to wait any longer.

40:58.891 --> 40:59.935
Commander McGarrett?

40:59.979 --> 41:01.197
Yes, sir.

41:01.241 --> 41:02.460
Sergeant Jack Ozuki.

41:04.418 --> 41:05.811
Jack Ozuki. Of course.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.597
Mahalo, Commander.

41:09.641 --> 41:11.991
Yes, sir.

41:13.819 --> 41:14.994
Thank you.

41:15.995 --> 41:17.344
Thank you.
