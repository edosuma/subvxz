00:03.545 --> 00:06.256
Man, how much do you
love the cereal bar?

00:06.339 --> 00:07.799
Right?

00:07.882 --> 00:10.385
I never thought I needed
a cereal bar in my life,

00:10.468 --> 00:13.138
but now I can't imagine
ever going back to boxes.

00:13.221 --> 00:15.306
I'd be like, "How does this work?

00:15.432 --> 00:18.268
How does what's
in here go in here?"

00:18.351 --> 00:19.185
[all laugh]

00:19.769 --> 00:24.607
-You see, it's funny because the box--
-[sighs] Don't mansplain me.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.693
And why stop at
a cereal bar?

00:26.776 --> 00:28.695
I wish I had
a cereal car.

00:30.238 --> 00:32.866
Just a station wagon full
of Choco Yum Yum Flakes.

00:32.949 --> 00:35.118
Every red light, I'd be like--
[imitates car screeching and eating]

00:39.914 --> 00:40.749
[laughing]

00:41.624 --> 00:44.711
And-- and when I'm running low,
I'd stop at the milk station.

00:44.794 --> 00:49.215
"Fill 'er up, Skip!
The 2% today, I'm feelin' wild!"

00:51.259 --> 00:53.136
And what's up with this foam pit,
am I right?

00:53.219 --> 00:55.638
I mean, seriously, foam pit?

00:55.722 --> 00:57.390
More like arm pit.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.184
Has anyone smelled
this thing lately?

01:00.560 --> 01:02.145
This guy knows
what I'm talkin' about.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.939
I do, it smells
so bad in there.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.734
And what's the deal
with this swing?

01:07.817 --> 01:09.694
What's it doing
inside the house?

01:09.778 --> 01:11.363
Is there some
sort of mix up?

01:11.446 --> 01:13.948
Is there a playground
out there where a parent

01:14.032 --> 01:16.034
is pushing their kid
on a toilet?

01:17.619 --> 01:19.662
-[toaster dings]
-Oh! That's my bagel.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.539
I'll be here all week...

01:21.623 --> 01:23.041
'cause I live here.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.506
Frankie, that
was so funny!

01:29.589 --> 01:31.549
Thanks! It's always great
to get a couple laughs.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.802
Couple? You killed!

01:33.885 --> 01:37.514
Oh, I mean, obviously, I don't like to use
that sort of violent language,

01:37.597 --> 01:39.849
but I-I know it's what
people say so I'm trying to be supportive.

01:39.933 --> 01:40.892
Thanks, Paige.

01:40.975 --> 01:43.478
You murdered everyone
in the house, Frankie!

01:43.561 --> 01:45.647
You're a total murderer!

01:45.730 --> 01:48.149
Okay, can you please
stop yelling that?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.860
I mean, you've always
wanted to try stand-up comedy.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.904
It's the whole reason
you have that comedy notebook.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.614
You know about
my comedy notebook?

01:54.698 --> 01:56.241
Oh, I thought
it was your diary.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.034
I read it once to see
if you think I'm nosy.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.787
I think you just answered
your question.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.915
Frankie, you're ready to give this
stand-up thing a shot, for real.

02:03.998 --> 02:07.002
Oh, um, what about
that cafe we always walk by

02:07.085 --> 02:08.712
with the open mic night?
You should try it!

02:08.795 --> 02:10.880
Thanks, Paige,
but I-I'm not ready.

02:10.964 --> 02:15.260
All right, but maybe we
could at least go watch an open mic night.

02:15.343 --> 02:18.096
Help you get a feel for it
and gain more confidence?

02:18.138 --> 02:19.806
I wanna say no, but...

02:19.889 --> 02:23.101
my gut is telling me that
you're not gonna drop this...

02:23.184 --> 02:24.019
so, yes.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.354
You are correct and yay!

02:29.399 --> 02:31.443
Hello? Open Mic Night?

02:31.526 --> 02:35.363
I'd like to sign up
Frankie Wong to perform comedy...

02:35.447 --> 02:37.782
is what I will say once
I find the phone number

02:37.866 --> 02:40.118
for this place, call them,
go down there,

02:40.201 --> 02:42.579
and find out how a person actually
signs up another person

02:42.662 --> 02:44.581
for an open mic night.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.459

-[grunting in frustration]

03:02.766 --> 03:08.396
Man, Grandma really loves those bloody
vampire huntin' video games, huh?

03:08.480 --> 03:11.191
She says they remind her
of her childhood.

03:11.274 --> 03:14.361
I like not knowing
what that means.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.197
So, what do you got
goin' on today?

03:17.280 --> 03:18.573
I think Horse Face Guy and I

03:18.656 --> 03:20.492
are gonna go out
and get some hand-burgers.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.704
Uh...

03:24.788 --> 03:28.041
Did you say
"hand-burgers"?

03:28.124 --> 03:30.418
Uh, yeah. That's what
they're called.

03:30.502 --> 03:34.130
Uh, no. They're called
"hamburgers."

03:34.214 --> 03:37.592
[laughs]
Oh, Amelia.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.552
Let me tell you
why you're wrong.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.681
See, you don't eat
a burger with your ham.

03:42.764 --> 03:47.686
You eat it with your hand,
hence the name, hand-burger.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.021
You wanna bet on it?

03:50.105 --> 03:51.564
Oh, you're on.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.358
But, let's make
this interesting.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.902
When I win, one time
over the next month,

03:55.985 --> 03:57.362
whenever I want,

03:57.445 --> 04:00.532
I can make you do
the Chicken Dance.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.283
Anywhere. Anytime.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.370
Hmm...

04:05.453 --> 04:08.665
but, wouldn't it be
even more embarrassing

04:08.748 --> 04:10.709
if, instead of
saying the lyrics,

04:10.792 --> 04:15.171
the loser has to say,
"I'm a dummy dumb dumb" over and over?

04:15.255 --> 04:19.509
Bernard, she's clearly playing with you.
I'd back out.

04:19.592 --> 04:22.178
Grandma, please,
the adults are talking.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.263
Shake on it?

04:24.764 --> 04:28.059
Great. Now, we'll just look up the word
"hand-burger."

04:28.143 --> 04:30.478
And it says...

04:31.646 --> 04:35.150
"Did you mean hamburger,
'cause that's not a word"-- agh.

04:36.234 --> 04:40.530
Oh, get ready to dance,
Bernie Schotz.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.450
Anywhere. Anytime.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.746
What did we learn today, Bernard?

04:47.829 --> 04:48.705
[sighs]
When I talk, I lose.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.459
Good.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.626
And before you eat,
wash your hams.

05:00.592 --> 05:01.843
You know,
I wasn't into this,

05:01.926 --> 05:04.262
but I'm glad you suggested
we go to an open mic night.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.890
Watching people do stand-up
is gonna be great for me.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.058
Me too!

05:08.141 --> 05:11.478
I'm so excited to see
"people" do stand-up.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.063
You said that weird.
But...

05:13.146 --> 05:15.690
you say a lot of things weird,
so I'll let it slide.

05:16.691 --> 05:17.525
[cafe crowd claps]

05:19.361 --> 05:21.821
Hi, everyone.
We're your hosts.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.115
I'm Brittany,
and this is Whitney.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.659
We're best friends.

05:26.743 --> 05:30.580
Our friendship is based
on a deep, deep connection.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.915
Our names rhyme!

05:33.083 --> 05:35.377
Yeah, I met Whitney,
and instantly thought,

05:35.460 --> 05:39.089
"Wow, horrible personality,
terrible breath...

05:39.172 --> 05:40.465
but her name
sounds like mine,

05:40.548 --> 05:41.800
so besties for life."

05:43.218 --> 05:45.178
Let's get to our first open mic-er.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.431
This comic was
so excited to perform

05:48.515 --> 05:50.308
she called here
10 times today

05:50.392 --> 05:52.644
to beg to be in the show.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.230
[sing-songy]
Embarrassing.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.565
Give it up for Frankie Wong!

05:57.649 --> 05:58.525
-[cafe crowd claps]
-What?

06:00.235 --> 06:01.486
Surprise!

06:01.569 --> 06:03.655
Paige, I told you
I wasn't ready.

06:03.738 --> 06:04.906
I don't have
anything prepared.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.408
I didn't even bring
my comedy notebook.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.534
I did!

06:08.368 --> 06:11.996
Frankie, you're the
funniest person I know.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.498
You can do this.

You're doing great!

06:25.969 --> 06:32.892
So, uh... who here has
a cereal bar in their kitchen?

06:35.645 --> 06:41.151
Right, well, how cool would it
be to have a cereal car?

06:41.234 --> 06:44.112
So you could eat cereal
every time you stop.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.655
Like...

06:47.282 --> 06:49.951
-[Paige laughs]
-[heckler] I don't get it!

06:50.035 --> 06:53.747
Is the car full of cereal,
or made of cereal?

06:53.830 --> 06:56.207
Uh... I'm not sure.

06:56.291 --> 06:59.711
Ha.
I do know it runs on milk!

07:01.212 --> 07:05.008
Nothing? Okay, um...

07:07.093 --> 07:11.222
Don't you hate it when your
foam pit smells like arm pit?

07:11.306 --> 07:12.140
[Paige laughs]

07:12.682 --> 07:14.934
What's a foam pit?

07:15.018 --> 07:19.814
Also, I still need closure
on the cereal car thing.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.275
Uh...

07:24.486 --> 07:27.947
I'm sorry, guys.
I wasn't ready for this.

07:28.031 --> 07:31.659
The only reason I'm up here
is because my friend Paige signed me up.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.496
Paige is one of those
overly positive people.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.332
If she got hit by a car, she'd say,
"At least, it wasn't a bus."

07:37.415 --> 07:40.043
And if she got hit by a bus, she'd say,
"At least the car thing's over."

07:40.126 --> 07:43.963
-[crowd laughs]
-Oh, okay, uh...

07:45.382 --> 07:48.218
That's the thing when you have
a friend who's so positive,

07:48.301 --> 07:50.220
you never know how
you're actually doing.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.348
Because, according to Paige,
you're always doing great!

07:53.431 --> 07:56.351
You got parsley in your teeth?
You're doing great!

07:56.434 --> 07:58.770
You stubbed your toe?
You're doing great!

07:58.853 --> 08:01.690
You got abducted by aliens
and they're sucking out your brains?

08:01.773 --> 08:03.692
You're doing great!

08:06.194 --> 08:10.448
This is so relatable!
I have an annoying friend, too.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.535
I mean, I wouldn't call optimism
an annoying quality--

08:13.618 --> 08:15.370
Sh-sh-sh-sh.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.622
All right, that's all I got.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.207
You were a pretty
mediocre audience.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.792
But as Paige would say...

08:20.875 --> 08:21.835
[crowd]
You're! Doing! Great!

08:23.169 --> 08:24.504
Yeah, ya are!

08:24.587 --> 08:26.923
I'm Frankie Wong,
thanks for making me work for it.

08:27.007 --> 08:27.841
[cheering and applause]

08:30.677 --> 08:33.972
Whoa, that went so much
better than I expected.

08:34.055 --> 08:37.350
Thank you so much
for signing me up!

08:37.434 --> 08:42.230
Yeah, ha.
You're doing great.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.232
You said it wrong.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.901
It's, "You're! Doing! Great!"

08:46.985 --> 08:47.819
You'll get it.

08:54.951 --> 08:55.869
Hey, Frankie.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.371
Amelia, it's me, Paige.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.332
Oh my gosh.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.126
I just saw
defeated posture

09:03.209 --> 09:05.920
and felt a wave of angry
energy radiating off you,

09:06.004 --> 09:07.881
and assumed
you were Frankie.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.050
What's wrong?

09:10.133 --> 09:14.346
Frankie did her whole
open mic night routine about me.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.638
She kinda made fun of me.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.806
[sucks air through teeth]
Whoa...

09:18.391 --> 09:20.352
Sounds like you
need some advice.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.687
And advice is Paige's thing.

09:22.771 --> 09:23.605
But you're Paige.
[gasps]

09:24.439 --> 09:26.024
What happens when
Paige needs Paige?

09:26.107 --> 09:28.651
<i>Just nod and act like</i>
<i>you're listening,</i>

09:28.735 --> 09:29.903
<i>even though you're not.</i>

09:32.614 --> 09:35.742
Mm-hmm,
interesting...

09:35.825 --> 09:37.202
<i>Not to me!</i>

09:37.285 --> 09:38.953
Oh, right, sorry.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.999
Should I... leave?

09:47.879 --> 09:50.423
Okay, let's give
this a shot.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.177
Now what did Frankie
say about you?

09:54.260 --> 09:55.804
I don't know,
she did, like,

09:55.887 --> 09:57.389
this weird
impression of me,

09:57.472 --> 09:58.556
and people laughed.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.976
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm...

10:02.060 --> 10:04.979
And how did this make
your feelings...

10:06.690 --> 10:08.400
feel?

10:08.483 --> 10:11.695
Um, I guess it made me
self-conscious and awkward.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.114
And did you tell Bernie
how you feel--

10:14.197 --> 10:16.241
-Frankie.
-Frankie?

10:16.324 --> 10:18.910
I can't! She had
so much fun up there.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.579
I don't want to be a downer
and take that away from her.

10:21.663 --> 10:22.872
So, what do you think
I should do?

10:24.332 --> 10:27.252
<i>Mm-mm. You're in way</i>
<i>over your head, girl!</i>

10:27.335 --> 10:28.586
<i>I'm out.</i>

10:28.670 --> 10:30.213
I'm in way over
my head, girl!

10:30.296 --> 10:31.256
I'm out.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.427
Hey, Paige. I, um,

10:35.510 --> 10:37.429
I just wanted to check in
about last night.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.098
I didn't ask if I could
talk about you on stage.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.100
And I... I was
just nervous.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.144
And people were laughing,
so I kept going.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.979
I-I-I just want to make sure
you're cool with it.

10:46.062 --> 10:49.941
Cool? Pfft, yeah,
totally cool.

10:50.025 --> 10:52.277
I'm-I'm no downer.
You were hilarious.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.529
Great. 'Cause, uh,
Brittany and Whitney asked me

10:54.612 --> 10:56.614
to perform again tonight
and do more Paige jokes.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.283
What?!

10:58.366 --> 11:00.201
I mean, great!

11:00.285 --> 11:01.870
I get "what" and "great"
mixed up.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.330
Hey, um, tonight

11:04.414 --> 11:05.498
you should do some jokes
from your notebook.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.251
Nah, the crowd really
loved my Paige jokes.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.294
Really?

11:09.377 --> 11:10.295
[laugh]
Oh, now, that's great.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.423
I'm gonna put that in my act.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.800
"Reeaally?"
Genius.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.219
Oh, by the way, thanks
again for encouraging me

11:18.303 --> 11:19.429
to do stand-up.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.390
I wouldn't be up there
doin' you if it weren't for you.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.438
Hey, Horse Face Guy.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.732
Do you have a second?
I could really use someone to talk to.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.485
<i>Oh. Oh no.</i>

11:33.568 --> 11:35.070
<i>Don't drag me into this.</i>

11:35.153 --> 11:37.280
<i>You think your own</i>
<i>thoughts, horsie!</i>

11:43.912 --> 11:45.288
Hey, Bernie.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.248
Nice shirt.
You look good in blue.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.753
Oh, I see what's
going on here.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.046
No, you cannot
have this shirt.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.798
You have to buy your own.

11:54.881 --> 11:55.715
[laughs]
You're so funny.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.009
Funny looking!

11:58.093 --> 11:59.386
Wait...

12:00.053 --> 12:01.471
Well... see ya, Bernie.

12:04.432 --> 12:08.395
Dude, way to go!
Lindsey is totally into you.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.730
Huh? You mean
my shirt, right?

12:10.814 --> 12:12.107
She's totally
into my shirt.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.858
No. She was complimenting
your shirt

12:13.942 --> 12:15.568
because she wanted
to talk to you.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.736
That's what girls do
when they like a guy.

12:16.820 --> 12:21.533
Whoa... Lindsey's
totally into me.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.201
W-what do I do now?

12:23.284 --> 12:24.160
Do I get a ring and propose?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.245
Do I meet her
parents first?

12:25.328 --> 12:27.372
What if her dad
asks me to join the family business?

12:27.455 --> 12:29.207
This is a lot of pressure.
I-I'm feeling smothered.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.667
Maybe Lindsey
and I need a break.

12:32.544 --> 12:36.840
Bernie, calm down. Just--
just go over and talk to her.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.633
Ask if she wants to hang out
after school some time.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.969
Okay, thanks, Paige.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.471
Hey, you don't see
Amelia around, do you?

12:43.555 --> 12:45.557
Um, no, I think she
went home, why?

12:45.640 --> 12:47.267
Let's just say
I really don't feel like

12:47.350 --> 12:49.060
chicken dancing right now,
you know what I mean?

12:50.228 --> 12:51.688
No...

12:54.149 --> 12:56.901
Lindsey!
Long time, no see.

12:56.985 --> 12:57.902
[laughs]
That's hilarious.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.071
We literally just
saw each other.

13:00.155 --> 13:02.907
Yeah. Hey, so, uh,
do you like movies?

13:02.991 --> 13:05.618
No. I love them!

13:05.702 --> 13:09.039
My favorites are comedies,
dramas, dramedies...

13:09.122 --> 13:10.540
[Bernie thinking]
<i>This is going really well.</i>

13:11.166 --> 13:12.667
<i>I think I'm gonna</i>
<i>ask her to hang out.</i>

13:12.751 --> 13:14.627
<i>She's cute,</i>
<i>she's fun...</i>

13:14.711 --> 13:16.463
<i>we both like movies</i>
<i>and my shirt...</i>

13:17.714 --> 13:20.633
<i>Wait. Why does that fake</i>
<i>janitor look like Amelia?</i>

13:22.510 --> 13:24.596
<i>Oh no, it is Amelia!</i>

13:24.679 --> 13:26.931
<i>She's gonna embarrass you</i>
<i>in front of Lindsey!</i>

13:27.015 --> 13:29.601
<i>Quick, think of one of</i>
<i>your masterful plans!</i>

13:29.684 --> 13:30.977
Ahh!

13:32.562 --> 13:34.022
[school bell rings]

13:34.773 --> 13:36.608
Okay... bye.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.822
Oh, hey, Amelia.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.327
You got lucky this time,
Chicken Boy.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.913
But I'm comin' for you.

13:49.996 --> 13:54.542
Remember:
Anywhere. Anytime.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.546
I can't live in fear
like this.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.591
Amelia could dummy dumb dumb me
at any time, anywhere.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.051
It's psychological warfare!

14:03.134 --> 14:07.222
You just had to know the word hamburger,
Bernard. Hamburger!

14:09.057 --> 14:09.891
Look...

14:09.974 --> 14:11.810
-I'll help you fix this.
-How?

14:11.893 --> 14:15.188
We'll put you in
a made-up, embarrassing situation.

14:15.271 --> 14:18.650
Amelia will see you, think it's the
perfect time to cash in on the bet.

14:18.733 --> 14:22.487
You'll do your stupid dance,
but you won't care 'cause it's all fake.

14:23.488 --> 14:26.825
Wow, Grandma. That was
surprisingly detailed.

14:26.908 --> 14:27.992
Have you done
this before?

14:28.076 --> 14:31.413
Let's just say making dumb bets
runs in the family.

14:31.496 --> 14:32.580
Ask your sister.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.583
But I don't have a sis--

14:37.210 --> 14:39.963
Oh, my gosh!

14:40.046 --> 14:42.215
I'm joking!

14:45.885 --> 14:47.470
[crowd laughing]

14:47.554 --> 14:50.515
My, uh, my friend Paige
does this thing

14:50.598 --> 14:52.892
where whenever
she says the word "really,"

14:52.976 --> 14:56.479
her voice gets super high.
Like, [high-pitched] "really?!"

14:58.064 --> 15:00.817
"I like your top"
[high-pitched] Really?!

15:00.900 --> 15:03.153
"I love this song."
[high-pitched] Really?!

15:03.236 --> 15:06.114
"I robbed a bank and framed you for it."
[high-pitched] Really?!

15:08.324 --> 15:10.660
I don't even know why they
make car alarms anymore.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.454
They should just
use Paige's voice.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.914
[imitating shrill car alarm]
Really?! Really?! Really?!

15:16.332 --> 15:18.001
That's not what I sound like!

15:18.084 --> 15:19.502
Hey! There's Paige!

15:19.586 --> 15:20.920
Whaddya think?
Should we get her up here?

15:21.004 --> 15:22.380
[crowd cheers, applause]

15:23.298 --> 15:24.132
[laughs awkwardly]

15:24.924 --> 15:26.217
Uh, no, um, that's okay.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.344
Oh, c'mon!

15:27.427 --> 15:28.845
"You're doing great!"

15:28.928 --> 15:30.805
[all chanting] "You're doing great!
You're doing great!

15:33.016 --> 15:35.685
-You're doing great!"
-[cheering and applause]

15:37.562 --> 15:38.897
Say hi, Paige.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.191
Hi, Paige.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.277
Look who's getting
the laughs now.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.446
Maybe she should have
the mic instead of me.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.489
-[Frankie] Yeah?
-[applause]

15:48.907 --> 15:49.991
Maybe I should.

15:51.076 --> 15:53.370
You know, uh, I'm surprised
Frankie's even doing comedy.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.455
She's actually kinda lazy.

15:55.538 --> 15:58.625
Like if she won the lottery,
it'd be like, "Frankie, congratulations!

15:58.708 --> 16:00.126
You won 50 million dollars!

16:00.210 --> 16:01.878
All you have to do
is sign your name."

16:01.961 --> 16:05.507
And she'd be all,
"F-R-- Ugh, it's too hard, forget it."

16:06.925 --> 16:09.511
Yeah, well, I might be lazy,

16:09.594 --> 16:13.014
but compared to Paige,
a hummingbird is lazy.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.433
He'd be all, "Hey guys, where are the
flowers, I need breakfast."

16:15.517 --> 16:16.601
And she'd be all,
"Where ya been?

16:16.685 --> 16:17.977
I already had breakfast,
lunch, and, dinner!"

16:19.688 --> 16:22.899
Yeah, well, I may be a hummingbird,
but Frankie's like a bear.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.277
All she does is sleep,
sleep, sleep, then she wakes up, and goes,

16:26.361 --> 16:27.195
[growls]
"I'm angry!"

16:29.823 --> 16:31.324
Also, her feet
smell like lasagna!

16:33.535 --> 16:34.994
Speaking of cheesy,

16:35.078 --> 16:38.081
Paige cried for a month
when her goldfish died.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.291
You know who didn't cry?
The goldfish.

16:40.375 --> 16:44.129
He was going down the toilet like,
"I'm freeeeeee!"

16:46.047 --> 16:47.507
-Frankie eats her scabs!
-[crowd] Eww! Gross.

16:48.758 --> 16:49.801
[Brittany and Whitney laughing]

16:51.052 --> 16:53.930
Well, that got super uncomfortable.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.600
Yeah, looks like we
just found two new peeps

16:57.684 --> 17:00.145
for our Diss Battle
later tonight.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.980
Two comics going
head to head,

17:02.063 --> 17:04.315
tearing each other apart.

17:04.399 --> 17:06.317
Who thinks Paige
and Frankie should come back

17:06.401 --> 17:08.236
and duke it out later?

17:11.406 --> 17:12.991
What do you think, Frankie?
You wanna battle,

17:13.074 --> 17:14.868
or does it sound
like too much work?

17:14.951 --> 17:16.202
I don't know, I think
we're doing great.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.669
What the heck was that?

17:24.753 --> 17:26.254
Oh, yeah?
You don't like it so much

17:26.338 --> 17:27.547
when the jokes are
about you, do you?

17:27.630 --> 17:28.715
What?

17:28.798 --> 17:30.550
Are you mad that I
was talking about you on stage?

17:30.633 --> 17:32.385
Of course I am!

17:32.469 --> 17:34.637
I clearly told you that
I didn't want you making jokes about me.

17:34.763 --> 17:35.680
No, you didn't!

17:35.764 --> 17:37.682
You said it was cool
and it was fine.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.851
Well you should know me
well enough to know that

17:39.934 --> 17:43.271
when I say things are fine,
they're not fine.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.731
Paige, that's crazy.

17:44.814 --> 17:45.940
You should've just
told me the truth.

17:46.024 --> 17:48.068
Oh, so now I'm
a dishonest crazy person?

17:48.151 --> 17:49.736
Why don't you put that
in your stupid act?

17:49.819 --> 17:51.696
Oh, so now
my act is stupid?!

17:51.780 --> 17:54.741
Whoa, ladies.
Save it for the stage.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.035
The Diss Battle doesn't
start for another hour.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.621
C'mon, I'll give you
some diss coaching.

17:59.704 --> 18:00.997
Yeah, you need
some coaching!

18:01.081 --> 18:02.499
Yeah, I'll coach your face!

18:02.582 --> 18:04.584
All right, we'll work
on your comebacks.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.380
I can give you
some pointers, too.

18:08.463 --> 18:09.631
After you're
done with Paige,

18:09.714 --> 18:11.675
she's gonna crawl home
crying to mommy.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.594
Actually, she'll probably end up crying to
me, 'cause we live together.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.931
[laughs]
Well, that's not gonna last.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.724
What do you mean?

18:19.808 --> 18:21.518
Well, Brittany and I used
to live together.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.686
Used to?

18:22.769 --> 18:25.105
Yeah. We used
to be best friends.

18:25.188 --> 18:27.816
Now, we just act like it.
It's pretty convincing, right?

18:29.025 --> 18:30.902
Wait, you're not
actually best friends?

18:30.985 --> 18:32.404
How can we be?

18:32.487 --> 18:34.823
I mean, when you're up
on that stage all the time

18:34.906 --> 18:37.909
insulting each other, you're bound to say
things you can't take back.

18:37.992 --> 18:41.579
You can't do diss comedy and be friends
with the person you're dissing.

18:42.414 --> 18:43.790
So, why do you do it?

18:43.873 --> 18:46.376
Duh, for the laughs.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.379
So big deal,
you lose a best friend.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.464
If the crowd's laughing,
it's worth it.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.299
Hey, Whit?

18:53.383 --> 18:56.344
Just want to tell you,
I still don't like you.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.269
Okay, Amelia
will be home soon,

19:04.352 --> 19:06.396
and I paid these guys
to act like your buddies.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.773
So, you ready to do
the Chicken Dance?

19:08.857 --> 19:10.942
I guess. I mean,
it is still pretty embarrassing

19:11.026 --> 19:12.694
to do in front of
all these tough guys.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.029
[laughs] Pfft. These wimps?
Hey, Tank.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.450
After this, you wanna go down
to the basement and tussle?

19:18.533 --> 19:20.452
No way, Roz.

19:20.535 --> 19:23.663
Doctor said you damaged most of
my organs last time.

19:23.747 --> 19:26.499
That's what I thought.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.753
Would you rather
pay the bet off in front of strangers

19:29.836 --> 19:31.463
or in front of Lindsey?

19:31.546 --> 19:33.089
She is cute...

19:33.173 --> 19:35.300
I'll be the judge of that.

19:35.383 --> 19:38.970
-[door closes]
-Oh! Amelia's home! Places, people!

19:40.013 --> 19:41.389
[sighs] Bernie?

19:43.058 --> 19:46.061
-What's all this?
-Oh, hey, Amelia.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.438
I invited some of my bros
from the gym over

19:48.521 --> 19:50.023
for a lift sesh.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.316
I greatly value
their opinion,

19:51.399 --> 19:53.777
and feel very
vulnerable right now.

19:55.612 --> 19:59.991
Well, it's clearly a perfect time for
you to pay off our bet.

20:01.076 --> 20:04.287
Yep, looks like I'm gonna
be doing some dancing.

20:06.039 --> 20:06.873
[Tank] Whoa! [laughing]

20:08.416 --> 20:10.168
That was embarrassing!

20:10.251 --> 20:13.129
None of us are very smart,
but we've never done that.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.676
Well, that works out.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.803
I was gonna make you
do the Chicken Dance,

20:19.886 --> 20:22.055
but you already
embarrassed yourself,

20:22.138 --> 20:24.683
so... I'll save it
for another time.

20:24.766 --> 20:27.185
Amelia, no, I can't
take this anymore!

20:27.268 --> 20:30.063
We faked this whole
thing to trick you.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.691
There's a girl at school
who might actually like me,

20:32.774 --> 20:34.567
or maybe just
my shirt, but...

20:34.651 --> 20:36.444
I didn't want you to
embarrass me in front of her.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.280
Oh, my gosh...

20:39.364 --> 20:40.865
I'm so sorry.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.451
I didn't know this was
torturing you so much.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.329
Tell you what.
I'll call the bet off.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.082
Really?
Thanks, Amelia.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.418
Sorry I was such a jerk
about the whole hand-burger thing.

20:52.711 --> 20:54.212
Tell you what.
I'll text Lindsey

20:54.295 --> 20:55.755
and see if she wants to go
to the Paige and Frankie

20:55.839 --> 20:56.715
diss battle.
You wanna come?

20:56.798 --> 21:00.510
Yeah, it smells like
gross dude sweat in here.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.430
Thank you!

21:06.725 --> 21:08.268
[crowd laughing]

21:08.351 --> 21:12.230
Now, I don't want to say
that Brittany's not smart,

21:12.313 --> 21:13.481
only because those
words are too big,

21:13.565 --> 21:15.233
and she won't
understand them!

21:17.861 --> 21:19.988
Good to hear
you guys laughing.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.574
You know laughter
is the best medicine,

21:22.657 --> 21:28.455
which means Whitney's
face must be curing the world.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.874
That's it for us.

21:30.957 --> 21:34.294
But up next, two girls who are
gonna tear into each other.

21:34.377 --> 21:38.173
-Paige and Frankie!
-[applause, cheering]

21:39.924 --> 21:42.594
-You were terrible out there.
-You're terrible everywhere.

21:46.681 --> 21:48.433
Hey. What's wrong, Frankie?

21:48.516 --> 21:50.101
Gettin' cold feet?

21:50.185 --> 21:51.353
I'll even let you go first.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.731
Yeah, I wanna go first.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.734
You guys want to hear
something juicy about Paige?

21:57.817 --> 21:58.651
[crowd] Yeah!

21:59.027 --> 22:02.197
Oh, this is gonna be good.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.366
Paige Olvera...

22:05.533 --> 22:09.204
is the best friend
a girl could ever ask for.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.456
Huh?

22:11.539 --> 22:12.457
Um...

22:12.540 --> 22:13.375
[crowd murmuring]

22:14.125 --> 22:15.460
Oh, yeah?
Well...

22:15.543 --> 22:17.462
you guys wanna hear
the worst thing about Frankie?

22:17.545 --> 22:18.755
[crowd]
Yeah!

22:18.880 --> 22:20.924
You're gonna have
to ask someone else

22:21.007 --> 22:23.843
'cause I can't think of anyone
I'm a bigger fan of.

22:23.927 --> 22:27.305
Their tone is angry,
but their words are nice.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.349
Yeah, I've known these
girls for three years,

22:29.432 --> 22:31.851
and I still can't
figure 'em out.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.896
I got more.
Paige is so cheap...

22:34.979 --> 22:37.065
[crowd]
How cheap is she?

22:37.148 --> 22:39.150
She's so cheap
she can't afford

22:39.234 --> 22:41.152
to lose a best friend like me,

22:41.236 --> 22:45.156
who would loan her money if she ever
desperately needed it.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.074
-[mic drop]
-[crowd boos]

22:48.660 --> 22:51.663
What does that even mean?!

22:51.746 --> 22:56.251
It means Frankie Wong
is my best friend and she always will be.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.795
And she's gonna be
a huge stand-up comedian one day.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.130
If that's what she wants.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.923
She could also be
a Supreme Court justice.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.091
A funny one!

23:03.174 --> 23:05.385
Because now, more
than ever, we need that.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.889
-Love you.
-Love you more.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.561
[applause]

23:16.438 --> 23:17.689
That was really fun, Bernie.

23:17.772 --> 23:18.857
Thanks for inviting me.

23:18.940 --> 23:21.484
Thanks for coming.
I had a great time.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.194
Me, too.

23:23.278 --> 23:24.696
Do you think we'll
hang out again soon?

23:24.779 --> 23:27.699
Maybe. I guess we'll just
have to play it by year.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.452
[laughs] You mean
"play it by ear."

23:30.535 --> 23:32.912
Uh... no.

23:32.996 --> 23:36.124
The expression is definitely
"play it by year."

23:37.208 --> 23:38.918
Care to make it
interesting?

23:41.796 --> 23:43.048

23:50.180 --> 23:53.183
Let's give him a hand.
