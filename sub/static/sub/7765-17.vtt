THIS HAS ALL BEEN VERY NICE,

10:08.760 --> 10:10.940
BUT I MUST BE GETTING TO
"WIN THAT PRIZE" NOW.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.040
( As Scabby Grossman )
AFTER I WAS DONE WITH THAT,

10:12.560 --> 10:14.380
IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO GO ON
"WIN THAT PRIZE."

10:14.480 --> 10:17.160
YOU EVER BEEN ON THAT SHOW?
IT'S A BLAST.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.500
POâOâOâOâOâOâOâPS!

10:21.600 --> 10:23.860
( GLUG GLUG GLUG )

10:23.960 --> 10:26.380
JOLLY GOOD SHOW.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.620
JOLLY GOOD SHOW, INDEED.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.540
( LAUGHS )
