07:54.025 --> 07:55.544
get into the finals, and
win this competition.

07:55.647 --> 07:56.441
Great.

07:56.545 --> 07:57.615
Milly, what's on the menu?

07:57.718 --> 08:00.100
Green bean casserole,
lobster mac and cheese.

08:00.203 --> 08:01.135
Lobster mac and cheese.

08:01.239 --> 08:02.309
Nick, what's going
through your mind?

08:02.412 --> 08:03.690
Peppercorn-crusted filet.

08:03.793 --> 08:06.140
My husband loves peppercornson everything, so.

08:06.244 --> 08:07.176
Good.

08:07.279 --> 08:08.418
Benjamin, describe
your dish, please.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.903
BENJAMIN: I'm going to
do a chestnut stuffing

08:10.006 --> 08:12.768
on the salmon, bring a littleflavoring out with the cabbage.

08:12.871 --> 08:15.253
My mom has made braised
cabbage every holiday

08:15.356 --> 08:16.288
since I was a kid.

08:16.392 --> 08:17.980
That's as holiday
as it gets to me.

08:18.083 --> 08:20.120
GORDON RAMSAY: Michelle,how you cooking the venison?

08:20.223 --> 08:25.090
I'm going to sear it andbaste it with holiday flavors.

08:25.194 --> 08:26.264
Holiday flavors, great.
Milly.

08:26.367 --> 08:27.161
Yes, Chef.

08:27.265 --> 08:28.335
That looks very homely, Milly.

08:28.438 --> 08:29.509
MILLY: Yes, Chef.

08:29.612 --> 08:30.993
NICK: I'm a little scaredfor Milly right now.

08:31.096 --> 08:33.133
This is maybe a
little too casual.

08:33.236 --> 08:34.065
This is not the buffet.

08:34.168 --> 08:34.997
This is Hell's Kitchen.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.723
Just under four minutes, yes?

08:36.826 --> 08:37.896
Yes.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.071
Coming down to the wire,
I'm jammed up on top.

08:40.174 --> 08:43.246
I got to plate lobster mac andcheese, zucchini corn bread,

08:43.350 --> 08:45.525
mashed potatoes and gravy,green bean casserole,

08:45.628 --> 08:46.664
and saut ed spinach.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.528
That's five things,
three plates.

08:48.631 --> 08:50.426
That's 15 fuckin' items.

08:50.530 --> 08:55.396
GORDON RAMSAY: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.708
And stop, guys.
Well done.

08:56.812 --> 08:57.571
Let's go.

09:00.712 --> 09:02.921
Who better to judge this
incredible challenge

09:03.025 --> 09:05.234
than your own family members?

09:05.337 --> 09:06.407
Benjamin's wife Rossanna.

09:06.511 --> 09:07.443
[applause]

09:08.548 --> 09:10.860
Michelle's sister Lizzy.

09:10.964 --> 09:13.311
Nick's mom Jeanne.

09:13.414 --> 09:15.762
And Milly's girlfriend Natisha.

09:15.865 --> 09:18.454
An elite panel of
judges, as you see.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.904
Please take a seat.

09:20.007 --> 09:20.939
Thank you.

09:21.043 --> 09:22.769
BENJAMIN: My wife
is a former chef.

09:22.872 --> 09:25.288
She's worked at four-starJames Beard restaurants.

09:25.392 --> 09:27.325
Damn it, I know that my wife'sgoing to be super tough.

09:27.428 --> 09:28.947
GORDON RAMSAY: Let'sbring out our first dish,

09:29.051 --> 09:30.086
please, a seared venison loin.

09:30.190 --> 09:31.018
Oh my God.

09:31.122 --> 09:32.364
GORDON RAMSAY: Now, chefs.

09:32.468 --> 09:35.126
A peep out of any of you guys,instant disqualification.

09:35.229 --> 09:36.058
Understood?

09:36.161 --> 09:37.128
CONTESTANTS: Yes, Chef.

09:37.231 --> 09:38.578
Ladies, please dig in.

09:38.681 --> 09:39.475
Mm.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.133
Bon appetit.

09:42.236 --> 09:43.962
How does that venison pop?

09:44.066 --> 09:46.033
Does it melt in your mouth?

09:46.137 --> 09:47.276
A little too rare.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.311
It's still good, though.

09:48.415 --> 09:49.796
You can still taste the flavor.

09:49.899 --> 09:52.177
MILLY: Natisha, all she
know how to do is eat.

09:52.281 --> 09:53.454
She can't judge no food.

09:53.558 --> 09:54.352
She can't cook.

09:54.455 --> 09:55.456
I like it.

09:55.560 --> 09:56.941
It kind of reminds
me of a little forest

09:57.044 --> 09:58.632
with the deer running
through, you know?

09:58.736 --> 09:59.529
GORDON RAMSAY: Yeah.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.427
JEANNE: No, it looks good.

10:00.530 --> 10:03.188
[chuckling]

10:03.292 --> 10:04.500
GORDON RAMSAY: Quiet
in the background.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.916
The flavors, they're
definitely festive.

10:07.020 --> 10:07.848
Christmas-y.

10:07.952 --> 10:08.815
GORDON RAMSAY: Great.

10:08.918 --> 10:09.747
Lizzy.

10:09.850 --> 10:10.851
Um.

10:10.955 --> 10:12.715
MICHELLE: My sister
and I are pretty close,

10:12.819 --> 10:16.098
so I'm like mentally tryingto tell her, like, sister,

10:16.201 --> 10:17.030
come on, it's my dish.

10:17.133 --> 10:18.065
Sister, it's my dish.

10:18.169 --> 10:19.308
Little rarer than
I would usually eat.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.481
GORDON RAMSAY: Slightly under.

10:20.585 --> 10:24.106
But I would eat that
whole thing right now.

10:24.209 --> 10:25.486
Dish number two, please.

10:25.590 --> 10:28.731
This is an incrediblepeppercorn-encrusted filet

10:28.835 --> 10:29.939
mignon.

10:30.043 --> 10:31.907
NICK: I was cooking formy husband and not my mom,

10:32.010 --> 10:35.531
so I have no idea what
to expect from her.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.326
ROSSANNA: The pur e,
it's a little salty.

10:37.429 --> 10:38.568
GORDON RAMSAY: Pur e's
a little salty.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.087
Yeah.
GORDON RAMSAY: Yeah.

10:40.191 --> 10:41.951
I think I like a little
rarer for my taste.

10:42.055 --> 10:43.297
So it's a little bit
overcooked for you.

10:43.401 --> 10:44.402
For me, yes, it is.

10:44.505 --> 10:45.679
GORDON RAMSAY: Yeah,
that's interesting.

10:45.783 --> 10:47.370
NICK: I like mine a littlemore medium rare to rare.

10:47.474 --> 10:50.270
My mom is loving being able tocritique on everyone's food.

10:50.373 --> 10:51.651
She thinks she's a star.

10:51.754 --> 10:53.238
NATISHA: It is a little
salty, but I think

10:53.342 --> 10:54.964
the potatoes balance it out.

10:55.068 --> 10:56.379
- Does it scream holidays?- No.

10:56.483 --> 10:57.277
LIZZY: No, not at all.

10:57.380 --> 10:58.174
GORDON RAMSAY: Interesting.

10:58.278 --> 10:59.072
Right.

10:59.175 --> 11:00.452
Mom!

11:00.556 --> 11:04.525
GORDON RAMSAY: Number three,the chestnut-crusted salmon.

11:04.629 --> 11:06.976
I guess it's holiday-esque.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.391
GORDON RAMSAY: Yeah?

11:08.495 --> 11:09.289
I love this.

11:09.392 --> 11:10.462
All goes together well.

11:10.566 --> 11:13.155
Maybe something I would
order in a restaurant.

11:13.258 --> 11:15.157
I think the salmon
is a little dry.

11:15.260 --> 11:16.537
GORDON RAMSAY:
Salmon's a little dry.

11:16.641 --> 11:17.987
Ay-ay-ay.

11:18.091 --> 11:19.506
It is good, though.

11:19.609 --> 11:20.403
GORDON RAMSAY: Rosanna.

11:20.507 --> 11:21.439
Um.

11:21.542 --> 11:23.234
BENJAMIN: Please,
Rossanna, please.

11:23.337 --> 11:25.685
Like my dish.

11:25.788 --> 11:28.308
The colors are a little weird.

11:28.411 --> 11:29.447
GORDON RAMSAY: Colors are weird.

11:29.550 --> 11:32.139
MILLY: Benjamin's wife
is killing his dish,

11:32.243 --> 11:33.175
and I love it.

11:33.278 --> 11:35.556
GORDON RAMSAY: Fourth
and final dish,

11:35.660 --> 11:37.627
a lobster tail mac and cheese.

11:37.731 --> 11:40.320
LIZZY: The lobster was a littlechewy, but it had good flavor.

11:40.423 --> 11:41.217
Big portion.

11:41.321 --> 11:42.322
GORDON RAMSAY: Mm-hmm.

11:42.425 --> 11:43.564
The flavors are all good.

11:43.668 --> 11:44.600
It looks a little messy for me.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.981
Yeah.

11:46.084 --> 11:47.810
MILLY: You know damn well that'show you eat on the holidays.

11:47.914 --> 11:49.294
Don't act like that, Nick's mom.

11:49.398 --> 11:50.399
I liked it.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.296
I like lobster.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.884
GORDON RAMSAY: Yeah?

11:52.988 --> 11:56.992
Natisha, nominate
your top two dishes.

11:57.095 --> 11:57.889
NATISHA: Number one.

11:57.993 --> 11:58.856
GORDON RAMSAY: The beef.

11:58.959 --> 11:59.753
NATISHA: Yes.

11:59.857 --> 12:00.892
GORDON RAMSAY: And
the second one.

12:00.996 --> 12:02.066
[inaudible]

12:02.169 --> 12:03.101
GORDON RAMSAY: And the salmon.

12:03.205 --> 12:04.378
Jeanne.

12:04.482 --> 12:06.380
Salmon and the venison.

12:06.484 --> 12:08.693
GORDON RAMSAY: Salmon
and the venison.

12:08.797 --> 12:09.798
NICK: We'll see
after this if I'm

12:09.901 --> 12:10.902
going to cook a filet for her.

12:11.006 --> 12:12.317
Lizzy, top two.

12:12.421 --> 12:14.526
Definitely the venison
and then the salmon.

12:14.630 --> 12:15.976
GORDON RAMSAY: Venison
and the salmon.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.840
Rossanna.

12:17.944 --> 12:20.118
The venison and the steak.

12:20.222 --> 12:21.257
BENJAMIN: Oh my God.

12:21.361 --> 12:23.639
Everybody but my wife
seems to like my dish.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.261
GORDON RAMSAY: We're tied.

12:25.365 --> 12:27.850
It's between the
venison and the salmon.

12:30.922 --> 12:33.960
I brought you in to
make sure that I didn't

12:34.063 --> 12:35.030
have to make this decision.

12:35.133 --> 12:37.757
[dramatic music]

12:47.111 --> 12:50.286
I brought you in to
make sure that I didn't

12:50.390 --> 12:51.425
have to make this decision.

12:51.529 --> 12:53.876
NARRATOR: In today's
holiday dish challenge,

12:53.980 --> 12:56.845
the chef's family membershave judged all four dishes

12:56.948 --> 12:58.778
and are deadlocked
between Michelle's

12:58.881 --> 13:00.849
venison and Benjamin's salmon.

13:00.952 --> 13:02.160
[sighs]

13:02.264 --> 13:03.955
NARRATOR: The decision
now falls to Chef

13:04.059 --> 13:06.716
Ramsay, who will break the tie.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.202
The individual
who cooked the dish

13:09.305 --> 13:11.929
that I think has all
the technical attributes

13:12.032 --> 13:14.828
of a festive dish is Benjamin.

13:14.932 --> 13:16.002
Congratulations.

13:16.105 --> 13:17.210
BENJAMIN: Thank you.

13:17.313 --> 13:18.625
GORDON RAMSAY: And saygoodbye to our loved ones.

13:18.728 --> 13:20.351
Quick, you can go
and give him a hug.

13:20.454 --> 13:21.248
Oh, boy.

13:22.629 --> 13:24.596
BENJAMIN: I haven't all-outwon the challenge yet,

13:24.700 --> 13:26.150
so it feels amazing.

13:26.253 --> 13:27.634
Everybody seemed toenjoy it, except my wife.

13:27.737 --> 13:28.566
Bye.

13:28.669 --> 13:30.085
- Kiss the boys for me.
- I will.

13:30.188 --> 13:31.189
Fist bump.
- All right, love you.

13:31.293 --> 13:32.121
[inaudible]

13:32.225 --> 13:34.641
Mm, love you.

13:34.744 --> 13:37.230
GORDON RAMSAY: Look afterPepper, will you please?

13:37.333 --> 13:38.127
Benjamin, congratulations.

13:38.231 --> 13:39.266
Thank you, Chef.

13:39.370 --> 13:41.165
Today, I've arranged
a big surprise for you.

13:41.268 --> 13:42.373
You're going to
spend some quality

13:42.476 --> 13:45.376
time with an incrediblethree Michelin star chef--

13:45.479 --> 13:46.273
me!

13:46.377 --> 13:48.172
[chuckling]

13:48.275 --> 13:50.415
We'll take a scenic
drive through the canyon

13:50.519 --> 13:53.522
to one of my favoritespots, Saddle Peak Lodge,

13:53.625 --> 13:55.386
in my Ferrari.

13:55.489 --> 13:56.905
Benjamin, go get changed.

13:57.008 --> 13:58.561
See you shortly.

13:58.665 --> 13:59.528
Thank you, Chef.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.770
Congratulations.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.221
Right, well, we have a bigdinner service tonight.

14:03.325 --> 14:07.225
This tree and Christmas
decor needs to go.

14:07.329 --> 14:10.297
But before that, as I wascoming in this morning,

14:10.401 --> 14:12.610
I noticed that our Hell'sKitchen SUVs have got rather

14:12.713 --> 14:15.164
dirty, so I need those
things absolutely

14:15.268 --> 14:16.096
cleaned, vacuumed, detailed.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.132
[groans]

14:17.235 --> 14:18.305
GORDON RAMSAY: Head
back to the dorms.

14:18.409 --> 14:20.411
We'll call you
when they're ready.

14:20.514 --> 14:21.515
MICHELLE: Ah, man.

14:21.619 --> 14:23.207
I was so close to
winning this challenge.

14:23.310 --> 14:25.174
Nick, why didn't your
mom vote for my dish?

14:25.278 --> 14:26.210
I don't know, ask her.

14:26.313 --> 14:27.970
She didn't
[inaudible] over mine.

14:28.074 --> 14:30.352
90 more seconds on thatvenison and I would've won.

14:30.455 --> 14:31.732
Good job, Ben.

14:31.836 --> 14:33.217
I knew Tish was going to votefor you because she don't

14:33.320 --> 14:34.839
even know what venison is.

14:34.943 --> 14:36.151
[sighs]

14:36.254 --> 14:37.980
Ah, fucking feels good.

14:38.084 --> 14:40.741
This is like aonce-in-a-lifetime experience,

14:40.845 --> 14:44.953
to have my idol talk to meand hang out in his Ferrari.

14:45.056 --> 14:46.506
That means the world.

14:46.609 --> 14:47.679
I'll even admit it.

14:47.783 --> 14:50.027
I think I have a huge
crush on Chef Ramsay.

14:50.130 --> 14:54.617
Hopefully, this is a precursorof future to come, you know?

14:57.620 --> 14:58.690
Let's go.

14:58.794 --> 14:59.968
Guys.Have a good one, thank you.

15:00.071 --> 15:00.900
See you later.

15:01.003 --> 15:02.211
All right, y'all
have a good day.

15:02.315 --> 15:03.281
Benjamin, jump in, please.

15:03.385 --> 15:04.558
Hey, guys, watch the
water, please, yeah?

15:04.662 --> 15:05.525
Don't want to splash the car.

15:05.628 --> 15:06.975
That's cold.

15:07.078 --> 15:08.562
Thank you.

15:08.666 --> 15:09.460
Look at this.

15:09.563 --> 15:10.806
MILLY: [chuckles]

15:10.910 --> 15:12.083
- Seriously?
- Oh my gosh.

15:12.187 --> 15:13.774
- Are we ready?
- Yes, Chef.

15:13.878 --> 15:14.741

22:42.430 --> 22:43.638
Read the ticket first.

22:43.741 --> 22:45.433
Last line of defense.

instead of lobster.

24:10.345 --> 24:11.139
What's the big deal?

24:11.242 --> 24:12.381
That should not be a hard one.

28:16.211 --> 28:17.005
GORDON RAMSAY: Focus.

28:17.109 --> 28:19.594
Check everything.

28:19.698 --> 28:20.699
NICK: Milly, nicely cooked.

28:20.802 --> 28:22.045
Thank you.

28:22.148 --> 28:23.736
Stop.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.565
It's a veal chop.

28:25.669 --> 28:27.464
Oh, fuck.

28:27.567 --> 28:29.915
Sabotage number
one, I just missed.

28:30.018 --> 28:31.123
I didn't notice
that it was veal.

28:31.226 --> 28:32.641
GORDON RAMSAY: Eyes
wide open, young man.

28:32.745 --> 28:36.542
To go home on something assilly as a missed veal chop

28:36.645 --> 28:39.062
is mind blowing to me, so I'mnot going to think about that.

28:39.165 --> 28:41.478
Going forward, I reallyneed to make sure everything

28:41.581 --> 28:42.375
is just perfect.

28:42.479 --> 28:43.273
Benjamin.

28:43.376 --> 28:44.308
BENJAMIN: Yes, Chef.

28:44.412 --> 28:46.276
Salt. Please.

28:46.379 --> 28:47.760
Yes really-- salt.

28:47.864 --> 28:49.175
Fucking hell.

28:49.279 --> 28:50.659
Come on, Nick, we're
getting flooded now.

28:50.763 --> 28:52.178
NICK: Chef Christina,
I need those garnishes.

28:52.282 --> 28:53.110
30 seconds, Chef.

28:53.214 --> 28:54.284
Duck garnish, 30 seconds.

28:54.387 --> 28:55.457
NICK: Right now.

28:55.561 --> 28:56.665
CHRISTINA: Duck garnish

28:56.769 --> 28:57.666
Duck garnish.

28:57.770 --> 28:58.564
GORDON RAMSAY: Let's go.

29:02.292 --> 29:03.086
Chef Christina.

29:03.189 --> 29:04.328
CHRISTINA: Yes?

29:04.432 --> 29:06.020
NICK: I need creamedleeks, not creamed spinach.

29:06.123 --> 29:07.228
I love the idea--- Heard that, heard that.

29:07.331 --> 29:08.885
Love the idea, but let's
get creamed leeks up.

29:08.988 --> 29:10.369
Thank you for
the feedback, Chef.

29:10.472 --> 29:11.404
GORDON RAMSAY: You're
absolutely right.

29:11.508 --> 29:12.509
Well done catching
the creamed spinach.

29:12.612 --> 29:13.821
Thank you, Chef.

29:13.924 --> 29:15.305
Come on, Michelle,
I need that lamb.

29:15.408 --> 29:16.513
Walking your lamb.

29:16.616 --> 29:19.619
On your right.

29:19.723 --> 29:20.517
Michelle.

29:20.620 --> 29:21.621
Yes, Chef?

29:21.725 --> 29:22.933
I need lamb sauce.

29:23.037 --> 29:23.831
This is duck sauce.

29:23.934 --> 29:25.349
Oh, my bad.

29:25.453 --> 29:26.834
Oh, Jesus Christ.

29:26.937 --> 29:27.731
Come on, Michelle.

29:27.835 --> 29:28.732
Seriously?

29:28.836 --> 29:29.871
I need harissa in
that [inaudible],,

29:29.975 --> 29:30.838
please, no cherries.

29:30.941 --> 29:32.149
That's for your duck.

29:32.253 --> 29:33.841
This is the last thing
that I need right now.

29:33.944 --> 29:34.738
Come on, Michelle.

29:34.842 --> 29:35.912
I need that jus right now.

29:36.015 --> 29:36.913
10 seconds, Chef.

29:37.016 --> 29:38.017
It's not hot.

29:38.121 --> 29:39.778
I'm trying to get this
meat station going,

29:39.881 --> 29:41.814
but it's just hard when youhave to jump on someone else's

29:41.918 --> 29:43.160
station and try to finish it.

29:43.264 --> 29:45.231
NICK: Guys, don't forget myegg with my halibut, please.

29:45.335 --> 29:46.163

NICK: Come on, guys.

29:47.268 --> 29:48.096
Pick up the speed.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.167
Shrimp, sauce, egg.

29:50.271 --> 29:51.065
How's that, Milly?

29:51.168 --> 29:51.962
GORDON RAMSAY: Oh, man.

29:52.066 --> 29:52.998
Egg is beautiful.

29:53.101 --> 29:53.895
NICK: What is this?

29:53.999 --> 29:54.793
The egg is fucked.

29:54.896 --> 29:56.622
GORDON RAMSAY: It's over.

29:56.725 --> 29:58.175
Milly, show a bit
of fucking respect.

29:58.279 --> 29:59.452

GORDON RAMSAY: Come on.

30:04.699 --> 30:06.459
We're up to our
eyeballs in shit now.

30:06.563 --> 30:08.013
Can we poach a fucking egg?

30:08.116 --> 30:10.878
[dramatic music]

30:17.850 --> 30:20.335
NARRATOR: It's over two hoursinto the final black jacket

30:22.855 --> 30:24.788
NARRATOR: --that will helpdetermine which two chefs

30:24.892 --> 30:25.996

30:26.100 --> 30:27.584
NICK: Milly, the egg is fucked.

30:27.687 --> 30:28.481
I need one more egg.

Egg in 30 seconds.

but he has an"eggs-traordinary" problem.

30:41.046 --> 30:42.012
You're killing me right now.

30:42.116 --> 30:43.634
Milly, what is this?
This is shit.

30:43.738 --> 30:44.532
We're all-stars.

30:44.635 --> 30:45.533
Get it together.

30:45.636 --> 30:46.534
I'm not asking for much.

30:46.637 --> 30:47.431
Let's go.

30:47.535 --> 30:48.881
MILLY: Right now.

30:48.985 --> 30:49.986
I'm sorry, Nick.

30:50.089 --> 30:52.367
All right, Milly.

30:52.471 --> 30:53.265
Much better, Milly.

30:54.266 --> 30:55.129
Thank you.

30:55.232 --> 30:56.682
GORDON RAMSAY: Service, please.

30:56.785 --> 30:57.614

30:57.717 --> 30:58.511
NICK: Thank you.

30:58.615 --> 31:00.341
GORDON RAMSAY: Last table, guys.

31:00.444 --> 31:02.067
Two halibut, two
lobster Wellington, yes?

31:02.170 --> 31:03.068
ALL: Yes, Chef!

31:03.171 --> 31:04.586
We've been pushed
so hard in service

31:04.690 --> 31:07.486
tonight, working
the pass, sabotages.

31:07.589 --> 31:08.383
I mean, it's a lot.

31:08.487 --> 31:09.419
Come on, Michelle.

31:09.522 --> 31:11.179
Where's that Wellie?
- Walking!

31:11.283 --> 31:12.525
NICK: Chef Ramsay's
trying to break us,

31:12.629 --> 31:13.630
but it's not going to happen.

31:13.733 --> 31:14.873
Let's go.

31:14.976 --> 31:16.012
Well done, Nick.
Stay down.

31:16.115 --> 31:17.565
- Yes, Chef.
- Follow, guys.

31:17.668 --> 31:18.462
Stove off.

31:18.566 --> 31:20.913
Yes, Chef.

31:21.017 --> 31:22.742
Mm.

31:22.846 --> 31:23.847
- Yummy.
- Great job, y'all.

31:23.951 --> 31:24.744
Thank you.

31:24.848 --> 31:27.437
Man, that was intense.

31:27.540 --> 31:29.749
Definitely the most intensedinner service I've had.

31:29.853 --> 31:30.785
In both seasons.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.994
[sighs]

31:33.098 --> 31:40.105
Listen, I want this job sobad for my girl, for my kids,

31:40.208 --> 31:41.520
for their hood.

31:41.623 --> 31:45.282
I want all of the little kidsin every hood to say, no longer

31:45.386 --> 31:46.628
do I want to be president.

31:46.732 --> 31:50.943
I want to be a great
chef like Chef Milly.

31:51.047 --> 31:51.840
GORDON RAMSAY: Listen up.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.533
First of all, that was tough.

31:54.636 --> 31:55.948
Nobody had a perfect night.

31:56.052 --> 31:57.605
Understand that.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.607
I want all four of you
to head to the dorm

31:59.710 --> 32:02.196
and come to a
consensus on the chef

32:02.299 --> 32:05.785
you think deserves to bealongside you in the finale.

32:05.889 --> 32:07.511
Is that heard?
ALL: Yes, Chef.

32:07.615 --> 32:08.443
Get out of here.

32:11.136 --> 32:14.139
BENJAMIN: Do I
feel safe tonight?

32:14.242 --> 32:16.658
There's no way we canall come up in a consensus.

32:16.762 --> 32:18.591
No, not really.

32:18.695 --> 32:22.009
There's definitely a season14 connection going on.

32:22.112 --> 32:23.389
[groans]

32:24.804 --> 32:25.598
Milly, do you want go?

32:25.702 --> 32:26.565
Yeah.

32:26.668 --> 32:29.430
So looking at the
last challenge,

32:29.533 --> 32:31.639
to get up at that pass
and see if somebody

32:31.742 --> 32:36.506
can go harder than me,
I've got to keep it 100.

32:36.609 --> 32:39.026
I want to go at Nick.

32:39.129 --> 32:42.788
Standing at the pass, lookingover, he was tireless.

32:42.891 --> 32:46.274
If you don't go up against thebest, you a pussy, and nobody

32:46.378 --> 32:47.689
respects that.

32:47.793 --> 32:50.520
Just like if you beat up on akid that don't want to fight,

32:50.623 --> 32:52.763
you don't get no
cool points for that.

32:52.867 --> 32:54.489
BENJAMIN: Milly, you got alot of heart and passion.

32:54.593 --> 32:56.250
Your food has a ton
of fucking flavor.

32:56.353 --> 32:57.596
Nick is cool as a cucumber.

32:57.699 --> 32:58.769
I know you don't
cook on the line,

32:58.873 --> 33:00.288
but there's times wepushed you in the kitchen

33:00.392 --> 33:01.841
and you're totally cool.

33:01.945 --> 33:04.120
It's harder to judge on youbecause I didn't watch you.

33:04.223 --> 33:05.121
You're on the red team.

33:05.224 --> 33:07.778
I didn't give a shit.

33:07.882 --> 33:12.680
The person I want to goagainst, I would pick Nick.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.130
OK.

33:14.233 --> 33:15.131
Benjamin is Benjamin.

33:15.234 --> 33:16.753
He can vote however he wants.

33:16.856 --> 33:18.789
But the fact of the
matter is, I've only

33:18.893 --> 33:20.584
worked with these guys
for two dinner services,

33:20.688 --> 33:22.207
so they can't really judge me.

33:22.310 --> 33:24.968
Kind of feel like the
odd woman out right now.

33:25.072 --> 33:25.865
Ooh.

33:25.969 --> 33:27.005
Can we move over there?

33:27.108 --> 33:28.834
MILLY: Yeah, it got a
little crazy over here.

33:28.937 --> 33:29.973
MICHELLE: I really,
really, really

33:30.077 --> 33:30.974
want to win "Hell's Kitchen."

33:31.078 --> 33:32.251
I was so close last time.

33:32.355 --> 33:33.839
I know I can do it this time.

33:33.942 --> 33:35.047
I'm not going to
psych myself out.

33:35.151 --> 33:36.876
I'm not going to letanyone else psych me out.

33:36.980 --> 33:38.844
Y'all are voting based
on the entire season,

33:38.947 --> 33:40.708
and you've only worked withme in two dinner services--

33:40.811 --> 33:42.572
Well, you said today wasyour worst dinner service.

33:42.675 --> 33:44.160
Today was my worst
dinner service.

33:44.263 --> 33:46.783
And then yesterday was
my best dinner service.

33:46.886 --> 33:48.129
Yeah, but you
weren't busy yesterday.

33:48.233 --> 33:49.889
Yeah, you wasn't
that busy last night.

33:49.993 --> 33:51.650
BENJAMIN: I mean, howmany fish did you pick up?

33:51.753 --> 33:52.582
I don't remember.

33:52.685 --> 33:53.893
It was fucking yesterday.

33:53.997 --> 33:55.481
And you missed the sauceon the halibut each time.

33:55.585 --> 33:56.448
OK, well--

33:56.551 --> 33:57.552
BENJAMIN: I mean,
I'm just saying.

33:57.656 --> 33:58.933
Those are facts.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.521
I don't think Michelle hadreally a good service tonight.

34:00.624 --> 34:02.592
I thought her service
was kind of poor.

34:02.695 --> 34:04.007
I mean, it was a
fucking nightmare.

34:04.111 --> 34:04.904
Who's your decision?

34:05.008 --> 34:07.321
Who do you choose?

34:07.424 --> 34:08.839
Nick.

34:08.943 --> 34:09.840
[chuckles]

34:09.944 --> 34:11.325
MICHELLE: Wait a second.
- Let her think.

34:11.428 --> 34:12.464
BENJAMIN: You just lookedat him like that, as--

34:12.567 --> 34:13.982
MICHELLE: Well, I'm
looking at each of you.

34:14.086 --> 34:15.329
[chuckles]

34:15.432 --> 34:17.676
I mean, I want
to go against Nick.

34:17.779 --> 34:18.642
Surprise.

34:18.746 --> 34:19.712
So you're safe, Nick.

34:19.816 --> 34:20.610
You gotta be.

34:20.713 --> 34:21.956
No, I don't.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.820
Chef Ramsay could easily belike, that's cute that you

34:23.923 --> 34:25.718
guys picked him, but too bad.

34:25.822 --> 34:26.961
No, I don't feel safe.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.894
Just because three of
my fellow competitors

34:28.997 --> 34:31.379
have chosen me to be the personthey want to go up against

34:31.483 --> 34:32.725
doesn't make me feel safe.

34:32.829 --> 34:33.933
OK, Nick, who are you picking?

34:34.037 --> 34:36.246
I need to think for a second.

34:36.350 --> 34:37.765
BENJAMIN: It's really
up to Chef Ramsay.

34:37.868 --> 34:39.249
[sighs]

34:40.354 --> 34:43.219
[tense music]

34:49.777 --> 34:51.123
An amazing journey.

34:51.227 --> 34:55.645
All four of you have beenvery worthy competitors.

34:55.748 --> 35:01.271
I am not looking forwardto sending two of you home.

35:01.375 --> 35:06.276
Milly, which chef would you wantto go up against in the finale?

35:06.380 --> 35:09.417
I think Nick deserves to bein the final with me, Chef.

35:09.521 --> 35:12.731
GORDON RAMSAY: Why do you
think you deserve a spot

35:12.834 --> 35:14.767
in the "Hell's Kitchen" finale?

35:14.871 --> 35:19.151
Since the last time I seeyou in 14, I've grown so much.

35:19.255 --> 35:21.429
I feel like I'm just socomfortable in the kitchen,

35:21.533 --> 35:23.431
running the pass,
working stations.

35:23.535 --> 35:26.193
Tonight, I just kept fighting,kept fighting, kept fighting,

35:26.296 --> 35:27.953
and I could have just
kept going all night,

35:28.056 --> 35:31.405
showing that I am
a consummate chef.

35:31.508 --> 35:32.371
Nick.

35:32.475 --> 35:34.477
Two words-- fight
and composure.

35:34.580 --> 35:36.789
I think that I'm the
most composed chef here.

35:36.893 --> 35:38.550
I think that I
can handle my own.

35:38.653 --> 35:40.241
I don't melt under pressure.

35:40.345 --> 35:41.587
I keep fighting.

35:41.691 --> 35:44.694
I just come to cook, and Ithink I've proven that to you.

35:44.797 --> 35:45.764
Benjamin.

35:45.867 --> 35:47.731
Which Chef do you
think deserves to be

35:47.835 --> 35:49.802
alongside you in the finale?

35:49.906 --> 35:51.459
I'd want to cook
against Nick, Chef.

35:51.563 --> 35:54.152
I deserved to go in the finalebecause I'm technically sound.

35:54.255 --> 35:55.360
I'm a true leader.

35:55.463 --> 35:56.637
I have found my voice.

35:56.740 --> 35:59.502
I can be your chef forHell's Kitchen in Las Vegas

35:59.605 --> 36:01.020
and beyond, chef.

36:01.124 --> 36:04.058
I can handle the pressure.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.646
And finally, Michelle.

36:05.749 --> 36:07.510
Chef, I deserve
to be in the finale

36:07.613 --> 36:09.995
because every single day I'vebeen here, I've brought it.

36:10.098 --> 36:13.757
I have had to overcome
a lot of obstacles, all

36:13.861 --> 36:15.103
the bullshit in the red team.

36:15.207 --> 36:18.590
I'm the last woman standingbecause I held my composure

36:18.693 --> 36:20.730
and I stayed true to myself.

36:20.833 --> 36:22.421
I have even more to show you.

36:22.525 --> 36:24.009
And if I can get
into the finale,

36:24.112 --> 36:25.873
I think I'm going to blowyou away with everything

36:25.976 --> 36:28.841
that I can do here.

36:28.945 --> 36:30.188
Thank you, Chefs.

36:30.291 --> 36:34.675
This is a tough one.

36:34.778 --> 36:36.884
But it's time to tell you.

36:36.987 --> 36:42.614

confidence are what

37:23.413 --> 37:24.828

It's extraordinary.

37:25.829 --> 37:27.486

38:32.965 --> 38:34.726
We riding through clouds.

38:34.829 --> 38:36.314

38:36.417 --> 38:37.729
I've never seen
this many lights.

38:37.832 --> 38:39.040
I've never seen
this much energy.

38:39.144 --> 38:41.457
I ate caviar by a lake.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.837
I rode a horse.

38:42.941 --> 38:44.494

40:34.777 --> 40:38.366
This was so hard for
me, and it was so close.

40:38.470 --> 40:43.406
But I'm sorry to
say you are going

40:43.510 --> 40:44.718
to have to stay a while longer.

Thank you.

41:05.773 --> 41:06.740
Oh my God.

41:06.843 --> 41:08.569
I literally was like
an emotional roller

41:08.673 --> 41:09.708
coaster for me.

41:09.812 --> 41:11.192
I don't even know how to
process this right now.

41:11.296 --> 41:12.746
Yay!

41:12.849 --> 41:14.195
Good job.

41:14.299 --> 41:16.853
MICHELLE: I got to kick it into,like, seventh gear, 10th gear.

41:16.957 --> 41:19.235
Whatever gear-- how many gearsthere are, I have no idea.

41:19.338 --> 41:20.650
Oh my God, I was
devastated for a moment.

41:20.754 --> 41:21.720
I know.

41:21.824 --> 41:22.928
I almost started crying
for you because I

41:23.032 --> 41:23.929
know how badly you fought.

41:24.033 --> 41:26.484
This is so amazing.

41:26.587 --> 41:29.038
I worked my ass off
this season to get here.

41:29.141 --> 41:30.177
I couldn't be more
proud of myself.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.178
MICHELLE: Oh my God.

41:31.281 --> 41:32.904
This is-- how is
this going to work?

41:33.007 --> 41:34.561
How are we going to do three?- I don't know.

41:34.664 --> 41:35.596
I'm freaking the fuck out.

41:35.700 --> 41:36.079
MICHELLE: How are
we going to do this?

41:36.183 --> 41:37.218
Oh my God.

41:37.322 --> 41:38.806
I am in the finals.

41:38.910 --> 41:40.083
I fought for my life tonight.

41:40.187 --> 41:41.499
It's going to be a
tough competition,

41:41.602 --> 41:43.466
but I feel like I'm
the best chef here,

41:43.570 --> 41:45.917
and I am going to prove
it to Chef Ramsay.

Send that recipe
straight to Vegas.

42:33.585 --> 42:34.724
[chuckles]

42:34.828 --> 42:36.657
I can't believe that Iheard Chef Ramsay say that.

42:36.761 --> 42:38.486
My mind is absolutely blown.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.592
NARRATOR: And who
will be left behind?

42:40.696 --> 42:41.489
That's really good.

Thank you, Chef.

42:42.870 --> 42:45.632
I want to start gettingpeople out of this competition
