00:56.042 --> 00:59.455
You can take your time figuring
out the pass code, lieutenant.

00:59.495 --> 01:01.937
It look like she's gonna be a minute.

01:13.558 --> 01:16.487
Why won't this butler guy open the gate?

01:16.558 --> 01:18.894
Anyone know why he didn't
show up at court this morning?

01:18.934 --> 01:20.997
No. But he's almost 70.

01:21.027 --> 01:23.799
Picking him up shouldn't
be a big problem.

01:24.389 --> 01:26.524
He's the defendant in a
murder trial, sergeant.

01:26.564 --> 01:28.024
I have a bench warrant for his arrest.

01:28.064 --> 01:29.775
He's already been a big problem.

01:29.815 --> 01:31.547
He's probably fled the country.

01:31.587 --> 01:32.835
Why isn't tactical here?

01:32.875 --> 01:34.396
Oh, there's all sorts of
stuff going on this morning.

01:34.436 --> 01:36.036
There's a shootout in the valley.

01:36.076 --> 01:38.553
There's some nut
driving crazy on the 101.

01:38.593 --> 01:40.818
It's just one of those days.

01:41.090 --> 01:42.590
Do we own this block?

01:42.620 --> 01:44.231
Is the press going to suddenly appear?

01:44.271 --> 01:46.375
Well, we've got it sealed
off in every direction,

01:46.415 --> 01:48.872
though you can expect helicopters

01:48.913 --> 01:52.275
when the freeway chase winds down.

01:56.392 --> 01:59.674
Who are those people standing
with lieutenant Provenza?

01:59.714 --> 02:01.959
Those are the Dutton
kids. They grew up here.

02:01.999 --> 02:04.908
We called them in to help us out
with the pass code for the gate.

02:04.948 --> 02:06.630
How'd they get locked
out in the first place?

02:06.670 --> 02:07.445
A will.

02:07.475 --> 02:10.304
All right. Call for the battering ram.

02:10.354 --> 02:11.975
Why don't we just call lieutenant Tao?

02:12.015 --> 02:16.371
–I bet you he could just hot-wire the gate.
–That'll take forever.

02:16.820 --> 02:18.809
Pardon me. Gentlemen,

02:18.841 --> 02:21.013
do any of you have a
key to that patrol car?

02:21.053 --> 02:22.189
Yes, ma'am.

02:22.231 --> 02:24.829
Thanks. Thank you.

02:24.829 --> 02:28.666
I do not like the looks of this.

02:31.254 --> 02:33.011
Chief.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.358
Don't drive mad.

02:50.701 --> 02:53.349
Excuse me, chief, what are you doing?

02:54.313 --> 02:57.002
Taking the shortcut, sergeant.

03:03.192 --> 03:05.832
One of you should stay with the Duttons.

03:13.664 --> 03:16.809
There's a bit of a drop.

03:18.524 --> 03:20.155
I don't climb.

03:48.568 --> 03:50.407
Go ahead.

04:24.734 --> 04:29.488
Call it in, sergeant. Make
sure he's here by himself.

04:31.180 --> 04:32.651
And let's see if we
can get those gates open

04:32.691 --> 04:34.422
for lieutenant Provenza.

04:34.463 --> 04:36.214
Yes, ma'am.

04:39.407 --> 04:42.550
Leave it to Albert to
hang himself outside.

04:42.730 --> 04:45.700
Probably concerned about
the mess he'd leave.

04:47.144 --> 04:49.886
I guess the guilt finally got to him.

04:49.946 --> 04:51.698
Wouldn't you say so, Deanna?

04:51.738 --> 04:54.570
Well, obviously, Dennis.

04:56.272 --> 04:58.403
Proud of his job to the end.

04:58.433 --> 05:00.155
Starched shirt.

05:00.195 --> 05:02.377
Is that his regular tie, Devlin?

05:02.407 --> 05:05.530
Yes. Just a little tighter than usual.

05:05.550 --> 05:08.572
I don't think I've ever
seen the man out of uniform.

05:08.612 --> 05:13.367
But then, he was hardly the
type to shop at J. C. Penney…

05:13.707 --> 05:17.321
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

05:17.621 --> 05:18.942
Right.

05:19.042 --> 05:21.084
Thank you for identifying the body.

05:21.124 --> 05:25.808
Sir, could you please take
the Duttons to the foyer?

05:31.173 --> 05:33.305
Excuse me. Chief Johnson. Yes.

05:33.345 --> 05:34.656
Deputy DA. Thomas Yates.

05:34.696 --> 05:35.692
Nice to meet you.

05:35.732 --> 05:38.640
This is James Bloom,
attorney for the deceased.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.271
Oh, I'm so sorry about your client, sir.

05:40.311 --> 05:45.766
Yes, yes. When Albert didn't
show up in court today, I…

05:46.186 --> 05:47.357
Uncle James…

05:47.397 --> 05:49.149
It's mine.

05:54.614 --> 05:56.165
Mind if we talk for a minute?

05:56.205 --> 05:57.736
Could this wait, Mr Yates?

05:57.776 --> 06:00.349
We really should get Mr
Turner down from up there

06:00.389 --> 06:02.621
before the helicopters
start swarming around.

06:02.661 --> 06:04.502
Well, because of the
legal issues involved,

06:04.542 --> 06:07.425
I'd rather the DA. 's
investigators deal with the body.

06:07.465 --> 06:10.648
And if there's coffee anywhere
in the general vicinity,

06:10.688 --> 06:12.309
that would be fantastic.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.281
Uh, chief Johnson, I
wonder if you're aw…

06:14.321 --> 06:15.332
Uh, pardon me, sir.

06:15.372 --> 06:19.005
Mr Yates, the fact that we're
investigating the death of the butler

06:19.045 --> 06:22.078
doesn't mean you can treat the
L. A. P. D like your own personal maids.

06:22.118 --> 06:23.909
I hate to interrupt…

06:23.929 --> 06:26.211
You stay out of this!

06:26.291 --> 06:30.205
I am trying Mr Turner for murder.

06:30.235 --> 06:32.897
Well, that seems like a colossal

06:32.937 --> 06:35.439
waste of your time, Mr Yates,

06:35.469 --> 06:37.221
but we are running
him down the flagpole,

06:37.261 --> 06:38.732
and that's all there is to it.

06:38.772 --> 06:39.933
If you want to examine the body,

06:39.973 --> 06:42.786
you may do so after I'm done.

06:54.346 --> 06:56.077
I'm done.

06:59.511 --> 07:01.823
Since we have glass in the mix,

07:01.853 --> 07:06.047
I don't want anyone but the morgue
attendants touching this body.

07:06.087 --> 07:07.648
Sergeant Gabriel, if you could see to it

07:07.688 --> 07:10.091
that we get an autopsy right away.

07:10.121 --> 07:13.213
And, lieutenant Provenza, if
you could secure the crime scene

07:13.253 --> 07:16.516
until we get an official
ruling of suicide.

07:16.546 --> 07:19.999
Mr Yates, so nice to meet you.

07:20.179 --> 07:23.612
Mr Bloom, if you could come
by my office tomorrow afternoon.

07:23.652 --> 07:24.503
Thank you.

07:24.523 --> 07:27.256
Thanks. Thank you all so much.

07:27.306 --> 07:28.216
Bye!

07:28.246 --> 07:29.798
Thank you.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.975
I'm glad he's dead,

07:38.015 --> 07:40.325
'cause that would have really hurt.

07:48.702 --> 07:52.723
Well, of course, if the
coroner insists it's suicide,

07:52.763 --> 07:56.174
but I always thought
Albert reasonably stable.

07:56.204 --> 07:57.185
Stable?

07:57.225 --> 07:59.145
He was indicted for
killing Mr Dutton's widow.

07:59.185 --> 08:01.146
But not convicted.

08:01.186 --> 08:03.056
He was never considered a flight risk.

08:03.096 --> 08:03.947
He was on bail.

08:03.987 --> 08:07.638
He was taking care of the house.

08:07.678 --> 08:10.559
And drinking. He was
drinking more than usual,

08:10.599 --> 08:13.249
but other than that, I…

08:13.269 --> 08:14.690
And you represented Albert

08:14.730 --> 08:17.561
because of your personal
relationship with him?

08:17.601 --> 08:20.572
Yeah. That and with the Dutton family,

08:20.602 --> 08:25.473
my entire practice exists
solely to handle their affairs.

08:25.503 --> 08:26.954
And, of course, the
children were anxious

08:26.994 --> 08:29.324
that Albert get the
best possible defense.

08:29.364 --> 08:32.575
Yeah. They seem like caring kids.

08:32.605 --> 08:35.596
Did your client seemed
depressed or anxious lately?

08:35.635 --> 08:38.457
He was a defendant in a
murder trial, Ms Johnson.

08:38.496 --> 08:40.388
That tends to be a bit unnerving

08:40.428 --> 08:42.717
even when the charges are ludicrous.

08:42.758 --> 08:44.080
Really?

08:44.100 --> 08:46.921
I was looking over the trial transcript,

08:46.961 --> 08:49.031
and it seemed to me that the deputy DA.

08:49.071 --> 08:50.662
had built a good case
against your client.

08:50.702 --> 08:54.493
Albert hated Mr Dutton's second wife…

08:54.523 --> 08:56.594
Angelina. Ah. Yes.

08:56.634 --> 08:58.364
Well, he's not alone in that regard.

08:58.404 --> 08:59.755
We all despised her.

08:59.805 --> 09:01.265
And she cost him a great deal of money.

09:01.305 --> 09:06.127
Everybody lost out in Mr Dutton's
last will because of Angelina.

09:06.147 --> 09:12.168
The children went from inheriting
an estate of approximately $2 billion

09:12.188 --> 09:14.429
to a paltry $10 million a piece,

09:14.469 --> 09:16.680
which was a stipend in their universe.

09:16.720 --> 09:20.001
Albert was the only one who knew
what it was like to work for a living,

09:20.041 --> 09:23.822
and his job was guaranteed for life.

09:23.872 --> 09:26.253
Maybe it wasn't enough.
Maybe he got greedy.

09:26.293 --> 09:29.914
My client was innocent,
and he was going to go free.

09:29.934 --> 09:33.395
And I know this because
the DA. offered us a deal.

09:33.415 --> 09:36.416
A deal? What kind of deal?

09:37.216 --> 09:40.117
I think maybe you should
ask Mr Yates the terms.

09:40.157 --> 09:42.518
I'm bound by privilege.

09:42.538 --> 09:43.938
But I took the offer to Albert.

09:43.978 --> 09:45.248
I advised him to pass,

09:45.288 --> 09:50.100
because “not guilty”
beats a plea every time.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.431
If your client didn't
kill Angelina Dutton,

09:54.461 --> 09:56.522
who do you think did?

09:56.562 --> 10:01.013
Oh, I wouldn't want to
speculate on something like that.

10:01.073 --> 10:03.474
But I empathize with poor Albert.

10:03.504 --> 10:08.551
We both spent our careers
straightening up after the Duttons.

10:29.274 --> 10:32.126
You haven't returned any of my
messages, and I wondered why?

10:32.166 --> 10:35.320
Maybe that's because I
didn't want to talk to you.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.353
You came to my house! Why
did you come to my house?

10:38.393 --> 10:40.492
Look, we got off on the
wrong foot yesterday.

10:40.532 --> 10:42.933
Maybe that's because
it was in your mouth.

10:42.973 --> 10:45.474
Here's what I should
have said at the time.

10:45.514 --> 10:49.883
I don't believe Albert
Turner killed himself.

10:54.845 --> 10:57.774
So you… had a party or something?

10:57.794 --> 11:00.573
No. I just don't get around to housework

11:00.593 --> 11:03.172
every single day of my life, is all.

11:03.232 --> 11:05.182
Right. Right.

11:05.231 --> 11:08.980
Well… glad to pitch in.

11:09.150 --> 11:13.029
So, I will start at the beginning.

11:13.049 --> 11:15.798
You can dry. All right.

11:15.818 --> 11:17.767
Near the end of his life,

11:17.786 --> 11:19.656
billionaire Roland Dutton

11:19.677 --> 11:21.885
fell deeply in sex with a stripper.

11:21.925 --> 11:24.014
To whom he left his fortune.
I just heard all this.

11:24.054 --> 11:25.744
The children challenged everything.

11:25.784 --> 11:27.263
And lost. And then…

11:27.273 --> 11:30.222
Just as Angelina got complete
control of the estate,

11:30.262 --> 11:33.102
she miraculously died of an overdose.

11:33.141 --> 11:34.920
Oh. You, uh…

11:34.941 --> 11:37.770
You missed a little spot.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.718
Honestly?

11:41.748 --> 11:44.658
I never thought Albert did it.

11:49.365 --> 11:51.454
You thought he was covering
up for someone else.

11:51.494 --> 11:54.513
Which is why you offered him a deal.

11:54.553 --> 11:56.713
So Mr Bloom told you about that.

11:56.743 --> 11:58.322
Yeah.

11:58.702 --> 12:00.931
Yeah, Albert was an easy target.

12:00.961 --> 12:03.260
He was alone in the house
when Angelina overdosed,

12:03.300 --> 12:04.770
he didn't have an alibi,

12:04.810 --> 12:06.879
he was fumbling in his
interviews with the police,

12:06.919 --> 12:08.378
and he had a motive.

12:08.398 --> 12:10.398
He'd lost his inheritance, too.

12:10.438 --> 12:14.117
And I'm positive he knew who did it.

12:14.147 --> 12:15.657
“Just gimme a name,” I told him.

12:15.697 --> 12:17.186
“Gimme a name, and I'll let you go,

12:17.226 --> 12:20.714
as long as all you did
was look the other way.”

12:20.755 --> 12:23.754
So, you put the butler on trial,

12:23.774 --> 12:27.892
hoping he would blab on which kid?

12:27.943 --> 12:30.491
Dennis Dutton has a history of violence.

12:30.531 --> 12:32.890
10 years ago, he was dating a girl.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.100
She broke up…

12:34.120 --> 12:35.750
She broke up with him, and she ended up

12:35.790 --> 12:38.198
getting clubbed to death with a 9-iron.

12:38.238 --> 12:41.207
Two days later, he was
on a plane to Switzerland

12:41.247 --> 12:43.956
and did not come back until
our best witness against him

12:43.996 --> 12:45.716
dies in a car accident.

12:45.746 --> 12:49.715
Well, this is all very
interesting, Mr Yates.

12:49.744 --> 12:53.013
Sounds like you've got a
lot of inference and innuendo

12:53.053 --> 12:55.013
for your investigators to follow up on.

12:55.053 --> 12:57.822
But as far as I'm concerned,

12:57.851 --> 12:59.661
the ME. returned a finding of suicide,

12:59.701 --> 13:01.310
so I don't see how this concerns me.

13:01.350 --> 13:04.349
Well, that finding has
convinced my boss and the press

13:04.389 --> 13:06.268
that Albert was guilty.

13:06.299 --> 13:07.988
But…

13:08.058 --> 13:10.947
Wait. Wait. Here. Use this.

13:11.667 --> 13:15.165
If you could get the cause of
death changed to homicide…

13:15.205 --> 13:17.054
Listen. Listen.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.624
If Albert didn't kill himself,

13:18.664 --> 13:19.934
then someone in the Dutton family

13:19.974 --> 13:21.333
is getting away with murder,

13:21.373 --> 13:25.611
and I hate to think this case is
closed and the killer got away.

13:27.901 --> 13:29.570
Look…

13:31.110 --> 13:33.149
I dried your dishes.

13:33.199 --> 13:34.938
And?

13:35.208 --> 13:37.327
And?

13:38.907 --> 13:40.206
I'm sorry.

13:40.246 --> 13:42.645
For?

13:44.384 --> 13:48.233
For being a condescending
asshole yesterday.

13:48.283 --> 13:51.453
If you could help me in any way…

13:56.618 --> 14:00.945
I took miss Angelina's
nightly scotch and milk.

14:00.975 --> 14:03.054
She took it with a low-dose
valium to help her sleep.

14:03.094 --> 14:05.083
Watch the interview
and judge for yourself.

14:05.123 --> 14:07.790
'Cause as far as I'm
concerned, I nailed this guy.

14:07.830 --> 14:09.420
About how long do you think that took?

14:09.460 --> 14:11.918
Less than 10 minutes.

14:12.667 --> 14:16.575
Housekeeper says you were
in her room for over an hour.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.774
That's impossible.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.972
Mrs Lydell had left the house before…

14:22.002 --> 14:24.620
Housekeeper says she waited for an hour

14:24.660 --> 14:26.039
for her daughter to pick her up.

14:26.079 --> 14:27.078
This is where he starts to crack.

14:27.118 --> 14:29.837
You never came out
of Mrs Dutton's room?

14:29.897 --> 14:31.545
No.

14:32.295 --> 14:34.943
No. I took the back
exit to my own quarters.

14:34.983 --> 14:38.580
Oh, well… ha ha… the back exit.

14:38.651 --> 14:40.100
Did anyone see you?

14:40.150 --> 14:43.299
I waited until I could see Mrs…

14:47.006 --> 14:49.645
Might I have a lawyer, please?

14:52.454 --> 14:56.945
I've waited my whole career to say this.

14:57.705 --> 15:00.676
The butler did it.

15:01.396 --> 15:03.897
Buzz, could you rewind for a minute?

15:03.926 --> 15:05.678
Say when.

15:05.987 --> 15:07.247
When.

15:09.558 --> 15:13.039
Right there. On the back of the chair.

15:13.089 --> 15:15.199
Isn't that a cane?

15:21.413 --> 15:23.155
That's disturbing.

15:23.186 --> 15:24.341
Was I right?

15:24.362 --> 15:26.299
That's what's disturbing. Look here.

15:26.339 --> 15:28.294
Advanced osteoarthritis.

15:28.315 --> 15:30.483
A degenerative joint disease.

15:30.524 --> 15:31.396
The socket is shut.

15:31.436 --> 15:34.538
This man was a candidate for
an immediate hip replacement.

15:34.578 --> 15:36.161
Now, that explains the amount of alcohol

15:36.201 --> 15:37.468
and painkillers in his bloodstream,

15:37.508 --> 15:39.353
but it doesn't change my finding.

15:39.393 --> 15:41.310
The man died of
suffocation due to ligature.

15:41.350 --> 15:42.454
Now, without evidence of murder,

15:42.494 --> 15:44.359
I'm gonna have to call this a suicide.

15:44.399 --> 15:46.171
So, tell us, doc,

15:46.202 --> 15:47.944
with a hip like that,

15:47.974 --> 15:50.088
would Albert have been able
to drag a 30-pound ladder

15:50.128 --> 15:52.494
from the garage to the house?

15:52.532 --> 15:54.586
And climb up the rungs
without any assistance?

15:54.626 --> 15:56.028
And crawl out on the flagpole?

15:56.068 --> 15:57.842
Maintaining his balance
while drunk off his ass?

15:57.882 --> 15:59.636
While tying a knot to the furthest end?

15:59.676 --> 16:02.159
Before leaping to his death?

16:05.515 --> 16:09.561
After a thorough review
of my initial findings…

16:10.153 --> 16:11.385
I declare that Albert Turner

16:11.425 --> 16:13.199
was the victim of a homicide.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.103
Thank you. Thank you so much.

16:16.134 --> 16:17.580
Thank you.

16:20.201 --> 16:22.367
Our first order of business

16:22.398 --> 16:26.669
is to find out everything
we can about the victim.

16:26.700 --> 16:30.811
I also want to have another look
at the Angelina Dutton murder.

16:30.851 --> 16:34.443
It's not unreasonable to think
that these two deaths are related.

16:34.483 --> 16:36.849
Lieutenant Provenza should be
particularly helpful with this

16:36.889 --> 16:38.485
since it was originally his case.

16:38.525 --> 16:41.349
Sgt. Gabriel, what is going
on with S. I. D and that ladder?

16:41.389 --> 16:45.620
Could you please tell them to
hurry up that prints report?

16:45.661 --> 16:48.385
I also want to talk to
the Dutton children again.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.400
I don't think James Bloom
is gonna let them talk to us.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.257
Well… I won't ask him.

16:52.296 --> 16:53.914
What's on your mind, chief?

16:53.954 --> 16:56.439
Deanna, Devlin and Dennis.

16:56.468 --> 16:58.963
They all have a lot of
money and a lot of time.

16:59.003 --> 17:00.799
And you know what they
say about idle hands.

17:00.839 --> 17:04.242
I'm always reading about Deanna being
bombed out of her mind somewhere,

17:04.281 --> 17:05.659
and she's got some DUI's.

17:05.699 --> 17:08.723
Yeah, and all those charges
have been dropped before trial.

17:08.763 --> 17:10.050
Yeah, but it indicates a pattern.

17:10.090 --> 17:12.476
Yeah, and Devlin likes
prostitutes of all kinds.

17:12.516 --> 17:13.854
I mean, it's like an addiction for him.

17:13.894 --> 17:15.739
Vice is always warning him about it.

17:15.779 --> 17:17.256
These aren't major crimes, chief.

17:17.296 --> 17:19.601
I'm not looking to put them
away for life, detective Sanchez.

17:19.641 --> 17:21.298
I just want to have them arrested

17:21.338 --> 17:23.395
so I can bring them in
and have a little chat.

17:23.435 --> 17:25.540
What about, uh, Dennis?

17:25.570 --> 17:28.775
I did the workup on the golf
club that killed his girlfriend.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.121
Pictures were gruesome.

17:30.161 --> 17:31.613
That was 10 years ago.

17:31.629 --> 17:33.354
There's no statute of
limitations on murder.

17:33.394 --> 17:35.111
We can pick him up for
questioning anytime we want.

17:35.151 --> 17:38.393
How many times are we
gonna solve this case?

17:53.555 --> 17:55.165
Hey, there.

17:55.375 --> 17:59.235
Anything I could do to
convince you to share?

17:59.835 --> 18:03.445
Obviously, you don't know who I am.

18:03.495 --> 18:06.215
Oh, but, um, I do.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.745
You're Deanna Dutton.

18:08.765 --> 18:10.875
Hmm. And you would be?

18:10.905 --> 18:13.935
Detective Irene Daniels, L. A. P. D

18:13.955 --> 18:17.805
You're under arrest for possession
of a controlled substance.

18:17.845 --> 18:19.715
That's a buzz kill if I ever heard one.

18:19.755 --> 18:21.635
Hand it over, Ms Dutton.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.071
Thank you. Vial, too.

18:23.085 --> 18:24.335
All right!

18:26.355 --> 18:27.745
Hands behind your back.

18:27.785 --> 18:29.655
Okey-dokey.

18:35.874 --> 18:37.324
How long you been working vice?

18:37.364 --> 18:38.394
Two years.

18:38.424 --> 18:39.964
You like it?

18:39.994 --> 18:42.354
Except for the hours.

18:42.384 --> 18:44.984
I can't believe how young you look.

18:45.054 --> 18:47.434
I bet you drive your
boyfriend crazy in that outfit.

18:47.474 --> 18:50.734
You coming on to me? We're on duty.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.144
I'm paying you a compliment.

18:52.184 --> 18:54.354
There's nothing wrong with that.

18:55.694 --> 18:56.494
Here he comes.

18:56.534 --> 18:59.914
I told you. If he comes,
this is always the time.

18:59.924 --> 19:02.036
His mood varies, so be prepared.

19:02.064 --> 19:03.684
For what?

19:03.724 --> 19:05.485
Excuse me.

19:05.515 --> 19:07.905
Is this hot young thing with you?

19:07.965 --> 19:10.075
–No.
–Really?

19:10.105 --> 19:11.715
So you're here by yourself?

19:11.755 --> 19:13.195
Yep.

19:15.095 --> 19:17.865
We'd like to be alone.

19:19.445 --> 19:23.705
Excuse me, boys. Have a nice night.

19:24.945 --> 19:27.305
I'm Devlin. What's your name?

19:27.345 --> 19:28.215
It's Julio.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.485
Ah! Julio!

19:29.505 --> 19:31.855
Me and Julio. That's our song.

19:31.885 --> 19:32.995
Jack and coke for me,

19:33.035 --> 19:35.245
and whatever my friend
Julio here would like.

19:35.285 --> 19:37.455
I'm good. I'm good. I'm working tonight.

19:37.495 --> 19:38.725
Really?

19:38.755 --> 19:40.375
So, Julio,

19:40.405 --> 19:43.414
what exactly are you into?

19:44.864 --> 19:48.064
Well… depends.

19:48.994 --> 19:51.614
What do you got in your pants?

19:51.944 --> 19:56.444
In my left pocket, I've got $2,000.

19:56.484 --> 19:59.982
Now what do you think I
could get you to do for that?

20:01.214 --> 20:03.864
You could get me…

20:03.894 --> 20:05.174
to arrest you.

20:05.194 --> 20:06.364
Let's go.

20:06.404 --> 20:10.124
Go ahead. Cuff me.

20:10.554 --> 20:12.732
And if you change into a uniform,

20:12.734 --> 20:15.614
I'll stop at an ATM on
the way to the station.

20:15.654 --> 20:18.524
Oh! Oh! Julio!

20:18.554 --> 20:20.104
Let's go.

20:28.964 --> 20:31.644
Not much to help you
with these interviews,

20:31.684 --> 20:34.744
although our butler was
negotiating with a London realtor

20:34.784 --> 20:38.694
to buy an apartment in the Mayfair
district while he was on trial.

20:38.734 --> 20:40.294
Are you feeling all right?

20:40.334 --> 20:43.124
No. I have a migraine.

20:43.154 --> 20:46.484
He was awfully optimistic
for a suicide victim.

20:47.594 --> 20:48.854
Thank you.

20:49.735 --> 20:53.325
Can I get a complete
financial on this guy?

20:59.124 --> 21:00.954
Lieutenant, thank you.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.584
You are harassing my clients.

21:06.624 --> 21:08.544
Why didn't you let
them call me last night?

21:08.584 --> 21:10.054
Mistakes were made.

21:10.084 --> 21:11.294
That's what happens when you arrest

21:11.334 --> 21:12.954
a bunch of people with
the same last name.

21:12.994 --> 21:15.074
If you want, I'll talk to the press.

21:15.114 --> 21:16.894
Stooping to blackmail on top of it.

21:16.934 --> 21:17.804
No, sir…

21:17.844 --> 21:19.494
–Chief.
–Yes. One second.

21:21.394 --> 21:24.494
I found out why we can't find Dennis.

21:24.514 --> 21:28.014
What? You're looking for Dennis, too?

21:28.064 --> 21:31.224
The… ahem… district attorney's
office picked him up last night.

21:31.264 --> 21:32.914
Thank you! What?

21:32.954 --> 21:35.804
Thomas Yates! How
could he do that to me?

21:41.171 --> 21:43.197
You sure you don't want
to wait for your attorney?

21:43.237 --> 21:47.263
I'm perfectly capable of ignoring
your questions without him.

21:49.746 --> 21:52.662
Mr Yates, may I have a moment, please?

21:52.691 --> 21:54.708
How did you beat me? I left first.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.485
Yeah, well, when you don't
have to stop for red lights,

21:56.525 --> 21:58.152
L. A. 's a pretty easy
place to get around.

21:58.192 --> 21:58.901
May I?

21:58.931 --> 22:01.407
Mr Yates, a sidebar, please?

22:01.886 --> 22:03.423
Excuse me.

22:08.575 --> 22:10.960
You cannot ask me to
investigate this murder

22:11.000 --> 22:12.757
And then interview the
suspects without me.

22:12.797 --> 22:14.225
You're overreacting.

22:14.255 --> 22:16.291
And just so you know,
you are not my boss.

22:16.331 --> 22:17.689
All right. And just so you know,

22:17.729 --> 22:21.053
I have the other two Duttons
in the holding tank as we speak.

22:21.093 --> 22:23.589
So if you attempt to
interview Dennis without me,

22:23.629 --> 22:25.935
not only will I release
Deanna and Devlin,

22:25.975 --> 22:28.221
I'll help them escape.

22:34.951 --> 22:36.758
I'll let you participate
in this interview

22:36.798 --> 22:38.095
if you let me participate in yours.

22:38.135 --> 22:39.902
I'm a little bit past
the “I'll show you mine

22:39.942 --> 22:42.228
if you show me yours” stage of life.

22:42.268 --> 22:45.343
Let's just open the door
and see what happens.

22:46.691 --> 22:48.658
Thank you.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.179
I'm sorry to hear that Albert's death

22:56.219 --> 22:58.129
has been determined to be a homicide.

22:58.169 --> 23:00.468
But you have no evidence,

23:00.498 --> 23:02.528
either physical or circumstantial,

23:02.568 --> 23:04.388
to connect my client to the crime.

23:04.428 --> 23:05.708
Can I just bottom-line it for them?

23:05.748 --> 23:08.098
You are to explain nothing, Dennis.

23:08.128 --> 23:11.797
No, no, no. Uncle James, they
have every right to be suspicious.

23:11.837 --> 23:14.687
But I'm way too smart
to have killed Albert,

23:14.727 --> 23:17.177
and my brother and
sister are way too stupid.

23:17.217 --> 23:19.557
Most criminals are stupid, Mr Dutton.

23:19.597 --> 23:20.696
That's why we catch them.

23:20.736 --> 23:22.386
Just because you got
away with murder once

23:22.426 --> 23:23.716
doesn't mean that you can
get away with it again.

23:23.756 --> 23:25.846
All right. That's enough.
Thank you. Let's go.

23:25.886 --> 23:27.316
No, no. Uncle James…

23:27.356 --> 23:29.776
Sit down. I'm not finished yet.

23:31.525 --> 23:33.595
I said sit down!

23:38.895 --> 23:42.804
Now, look, I liked Albert.

23:42.864 --> 23:45.874
And as far as Angelina is concerned…

23:46.014 --> 23:47.454
I don't know. Frankly,
I couldn't care less.

23:47.494 --> 23:49.554
I never even met the young lady.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.594
Thanks to people like Mr Yates here,

23:51.634 --> 23:56.253
I lost an entire decade of
my life living in Geneva.

23:56.423 --> 23:59.203
Oh, my god, is that lake boring.

23:59.243 --> 24:02.342
Albert was killed around
midnight on Sunday.

24:02.382 --> 24:04.232
Any idea where you were around then?

24:04.272 --> 24:06.582
Don't answer that question.

24:07.792 --> 24:10.052
You know, you are sounding
like a broken record.

24:10.092 --> 24:11.722
Mr Yates,

24:11.752 --> 24:13.911
I was in the very, very best of company

24:13.951 --> 24:16.331
because I was at home alone.

24:16.371 --> 24:20.352
I'm having a fabulous time,
you see, stone cold sober.

24:20.382 --> 24:25.331
I find myself… absolutely fascinating.

24:29.551 --> 24:33.450
Ok. This has been fun, hasn't it?

24:33.480 --> 24:36.580
We will have to do this again sometime.

24:36.610 --> 24:40.010
Uh, Mr Dutton, how did
you get by in Switzerland?

24:40.050 --> 24:42.140
I don't see you punching a time clock

24:42.180 --> 24:44.809
at the Geneva branch of
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

24:44.849 --> 24:48.079
Did you have a work
visa? Were you employed?

24:48.119 --> 24:49.059
Are you kidding?

24:49.099 --> 24:51.409
I handled Dennis' financial affairs.

24:51.449 --> 24:54.398
The money transfers
were completely legal.

24:54.428 --> 24:56.828
If you wish to speak
to Deanna and Devlin,

24:56.868 --> 24:59.378
I'd like you to wait until I arrive.

24:59.408 --> 25:01.858
Dennis, come along.

25:01.888 --> 25:04.388
He's so bossy, isn't he?

25:07.967 --> 25:09.897
That's your idea of an interview?

25:09.937 --> 25:13.377
You just pick someone up and
hope they tell you something?

25:13.417 --> 25:15.636
What's wrong with that?

25:18.826 --> 25:22.206
My client is in no physical
condition to talk to you.

25:22.246 --> 25:24.316
I just need an hour or two. I, uh…

25:24.356 --> 25:26.215
I overindulged a little bit last night.

25:26.255 --> 25:29.775
Speaking of overindulging,
uh, Angelina overdosed.

25:29.815 --> 25:31.105
Tell me, Deanna,

25:31.125 --> 25:33.175
if I were to get a search
warrant for your house,

25:33.215 --> 25:35.594
would I find recreational drugs there

25:35.634 --> 25:39.424
or some of the vicodin Albert
was taking for joint pain?

25:43.034 --> 25:46.573
I'll tell you what. I'll
make a deal with Mr Bloom.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.893
You give me an alibi for Sunday night,

25:48.933 --> 25:50.943
something airtight that I can check,

25:50.983 --> 25:52.343
and I won't arrest you for possession

25:52.383 --> 25:54.763
of whatever you have in
your medicine cabinet.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.432
You're gonna take my stash?

25:56.472 --> 25:57.512
Yes, I am.

25:57.552 --> 25:59.712
You're as bad as uncle James.

25:59.742 --> 26:01.393
You judgmental bitch!

26:01.413 --> 26:04.793
Why won't anyone let me be happy⁈

26:06.073 --> 26:09.252
I can provide an alibi for her.

26:11.262 --> 26:13.432
On Sunday, at the time in question,

26:13.472 --> 26:17.531
Deanna was finishing up her
30-day detox at a local rehab.

26:17.561 --> 26:20.601
She just got out yesterday morning.

26:23.421 --> 26:26.071
I hope you kept the receipt.

26:27.780 --> 26:29.230
Arraign him or let him go,

26:29.270 --> 26:30.656
but he's not talking.

26:30.680 --> 26:33.850
Now, now, that's awful
hasty of you, uncle James.

26:33.890 --> 26:36.280
I think I'd have quite a lot to say,

26:36.310 --> 26:37.710
if…

26:37.740 --> 26:40.249
they brought in Julio to question me.

26:40.279 --> 26:44.119
We formed an intimate
and immediate connection.

26:44.149 --> 26:46.329
I'm soul mates with detective Sancho.

26:46.369 --> 26:48.159
–Sanchez.
–Whatever.

26:48.189 --> 26:49.658
Devlin, take this seriously.

26:49.698 --> 26:51.378
You can't talk to them.

26:51.408 --> 26:53.548
I'll even say, “please.”

26:54.418 --> 26:55.618
She's gonna do it.

26:55.638 --> 26:57.428
Pucker up, Julio, baby.

26:57.488 --> 26:58.727
Yeah, I'd hop in for you, brother,

26:58.767 --> 27:00.917
but I don't think I'm his type.

27:05.637 --> 27:08.097
Well, he is the arresting officer.

27:09.067 --> 27:10.056
I hate all of you.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.596
It's dangerous in there, Julio.

27:11.636 --> 27:13.456
Watch your ass!

27:14.346 --> 27:16.414
Mr Yates, pardon me.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.678
May we continue?

27:29.728 --> 27:31.929
Do you think Albert Turner
killed your stepmother?

27:31.969 --> 27:33.567
No.

27:33.970 --> 27:35.266
Hi, Julio.

27:39.106 --> 27:41.800
Look at the twinkle!

27:42.965 --> 27:45.560
And you know Albert
was murdered, as well?

27:45.600 --> 27:48.103
Uh-huh. Hey, Julio?

27:48.153 --> 27:50.063
When I'm all done here, would
you like to come over for a while?

27:50.103 --> 27:52.546
Mr Dutton, may I have your
attention for a moment, please?

27:52.586 --> 27:54.284
One second.

27:54.757 --> 27:57.119
I wanna make detective
Sancho here an offer.

27:57.159 --> 27:59.179
I mean, as long as we're
here for solicitation,

27:59.219 --> 28:01.541
I might as well go for broke.

28:01.742 --> 28:04.215
My house, 24 hours,

28:04.235 --> 28:06.808
$50,000.

28:06.828 --> 28:09.713
And normally, I have a
really, really big party

28:09.753 --> 28:10.929
for that kind of money.

28:10.969 --> 28:12.759
Your father's will is in probate.

28:12.799 --> 28:16.166
You don't have control of the
$2 million your father left you,

28:16.206 --> 28:18.810
so where are you getting
the money for Deanna's drugs

28:18.850 --> 28:22.016
and your indiscriminate
sexual addiction?

28:22.036 --> 28:23.594
He doesn't have to answer that.

28:23.634 --> 28:27.544
No, no. A deal's a deal, uncle James.

28:28.338 --> 28:31.082
The Duttons are back on the
board of Dutton industry,

28:31.122 --> 28:32.942
a worldwide real estate company

28:32.982 --> 28:36.942
with perfectly above-board profits
from our global investments.

28:36.982 --> 28:40.892
And, to answer your next question,

28:40.922 --> 28:43.677
I was with my brother
the night Albert died.

28:43.717 --> 28:45.948
Really? That's not what he said.

28:45.978 --> 28:48.019
He says he was alone.

28:49.265 --> 28:53.718
Well, I asked him to
lie. He is so unreliable.

28:56.877 --> 28:58.741
Actually…

28:59.638 --> 29:02.459
I was with a hustler
that I met on-line.

29:02.489 --> 29:05.533
Give me a pen, I'll give you his number.

29:08.606 --> 29:10.128
How long were you with this guy?

29:10.168 --> 29:13.473
A matter of hours? Days?

29:14.199 --> 29:16.688
More a matter of inches, 8 to be exact.

29:16.728 --> 29:18.482
Don't get insecure.

29:18.542 --> 29:23.389
Sunday night, Monday
morning until 3:00 a. m.

29:23.812 --> 29:25.364
There, call him. Check it out.

29:25.404 --> 29:29.430
Now I've answered all your
questions honestly and completely.

29:29.466 --> 29:33.094
What do you say, Julio?
Shall we give it a go?

29:33.134 --> 29:35.341
You know what, Mr Dutton?

29:35.371 --> 29:39.230
I'd pay you $50,000
to go screw yourself.

29:39.976 --> 29:42.220
What do you think about that, huh?

29:44.763 --> 29:48.240
The Duttons don't take
rejection very well.

29:48.300 --> 29:50.093
That's a picture of Christine Barringer,

29:50.133 --> 29:53.367
taken a few hours after
she broke up with Dennis.

29:58.120 --> 30:02.138
I appreciate you sharing this
information with me, Mr Yates,

30:02.168 --> 30:04.082
and your passion for
getting the Duttons,

30:04.122 --> 30:07.799
but the MO. for Christine's murder is

30:07.829 --> 30:10.465
for more violent than those
of Albert and Angelina.

30:10.505 --> 30:13.150
Less planned, more a crime of passion.

30:16.196 --> 30:17.809
Damn it.

30:17.879 --> 30:20.926
Albert was our key, and I was this close

30:20.956 --> 30:23.201
to getting him to make a deal.

30:23.681 --> 30:25.796
It's not right, is it?

30:26.066 --> 30:27.559
People like the Duttons
get away with murder

30:27.599 --> 30:30.569
because they can
out-lawyer us at every turn?

30:32.791 --> 30:36.419
Well, now that we're sharing
information and all that,

30:36.439 --> 30:37.769
I'm sure we'll do better.

30:37.809 --> 30:39.589
I won't give up, and I know you won't.

30:39.629 --> 30:42.247
So let's just agree to call each
other whenever we know something.

30:42.287 --> 30:44.307
Ok. Good. Ok. All right.

30:44.327 --> 30:46.506
After you, sir. Thank you.

30:46.536 --> 30:48.826
–Thank you.
–Thank you.

30:49.035 --> 30:51.814
Tao's found something.

30:52.634 --> 30:55.443
With a little help from
forensic accounting.

30:55.483 --> 30:58.143
The Duttons deal with
banks throughout Europe.

30:58.183 --> 31:01.331
The kids keep themselves at a
remove from the day-to-day finances

31:01.371 --> 31:04.751
by giving James Bloom their
durable power of attorney

31:04.791 --> 31:06.360
to handle their business affairs.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.689
In effect, he runs the company.

31:08.739 --> 31:09.889
And they get the cash.

31:09.929 --> 31:12.019
Yeah, and they have plenty of it, too.

31:12.059 --> 31:14.339
Look what you gave up, Julio.

31:14.368 --> 31:16.838
Knock it off, lieutenant Tao, ok?

31:17.228 --> 31:20.337
Lieutenant Tao, you were saying?

31:20.377 --> 31:24.135
Our butler Albert Turner
had an account in Geneva

31:24.155 --> 31:28.074
opened by wire 2 weeks
after Angelina died.

31:28.114 --> 31:32.093
$5 million held in
certificates of deposit,

31:32.123 --> 31:34.782
automatically renewed every 90 days.

31:34.822 --> 31:36.112
But the will is still in probate.

31:36.152 --> 31:37.671
That money didn't come from the estate,

31:37.711 --> 31:39.380
Nor did it go back to it.

31:39.410 --> 31:41.509
Last Friday afternoon just before it was

31:41.549 --> 31:43.349
supposed to automatically
roll over again,

31:43.389 --> 31:44.779
it was transferred out.

31:44.819 --> 31:47.888
Where did it go? Dennis Dutton.

31:47.918 --> 31:51.106
So… Angelina dies.

31:51.137 --> 31:53.756
The butler gets $5 million in cash.

31:53.786 --> 31:55.545
The DA. offers him a deal,

31:55.575 --> 31:57.115
and the butler's money vanishes.

31:57.155 --> 31:58.964
And 2 days later, he's found dead.

31:59.004 --> 32:03.543
Ok, everybody, mark the date.

32:05.722 --> 32:07.451
I was wrong.

32:08.981 --> 32:11.110
Fingerprint analysis.

32:11.350 --> 32:14.719
I know the guy spent his
life cleaning up after people,

32:14.759 --> 32:17.738
but I don't think he
wiped the ladder clean

32:17.778 --> 32:20.257
after he jumped.

32:20.867 --> 32:22.987
But someone did

32:23.016 --> 32:26.375
because there aren't
any prints anywhere.

32:26.406 --> 32:27.675
Nope.

32:27.735 --> 32:30.164
Oh, god. I can't believe it.

32:30.194 --> 32:32.404
I've gotta arrest those
awful Dutton children again.

32:32.444 --> 32:33.453
How am I gonna do that?

32:33.493 --> 32:36.343
Well, this might help.
We just a got a report

32:36.383 --> 32:38.872
of shots fired at the Dutton house.

32:38.882 --> 32:42.925
Well, today's my lucky day. Thank you.

32:44.541 --> 32:48.145
We could make all sorts of arrests here.

32:48.175 --> 32:51.299
Disturbing the peace. Discharging
a weapon in a residential area.

32:51.339 --> 32:53.051
The one I like best is attempted murder.

32:53.091 --> 32:54.723
So let's try talking it through.

32:54.763 --> 32:56.427
And, Mr Bloom, if you'd
like to counsel them

32:56.467 --> 32:58.239
on remaining silent, I'd be happy

32:58.279 --> 33:01.113
to cuff them again, take them downtown.

33:03.766 --> 33:05.769
So, y'all can spend
another night in jail,

33:05.809 --> 33:09.934
or you can explain to me what
the hell is going on here.

33:09.954 --> 33:11.956
Well, Devlin started it.

33:11.986 --> 33:13.678
He figured out the
pass code to the gate,

33:13.718 --> 33:15.140
and he was here stealing our stuff.

33:15.180 --> 33:16.742
Ignore her. She's stoned.

33:16.782 --> 33:19.235
It's my fault. I was driving by,

33:19.256 --> 33:20.536
and I saw their cars here

33:20.576 --> 33:22.319
and I thought they were
divvying up the artwork.

33:22.359 --> 33:23.631
You tried to kill me!

33:23.671 --> 33:25.663
Not true. You're still alive.

33:25.694 --> 33:28.116
I fired a warning shot, and I hit

33:28.136 --> 33:31.661
that grossly expensive
portrait of my ex-stepmother,

33:31.690 --> 33:34.233
improving it in the
process, and I apologized.

33:34.273 --> 33:36.267
Did you get your ear
clipped by a bullet?

33:36.307 --> 33:38.529
No. She bit me! Oh!

33:38.559 --> 33:40.943
He called me a coke whore,

33:40.963 --> 33:42.695
and he was provoking Dennis.

33:42.735 --> 33:44.006
Shut up, Deanna.

33:44.047 --> 33:47.891
But it's true. He kept saying
that one of us had to be…

33:50.114 --> 33:51.115
One of you had to be what?

33:51.155 --> 33:52.737
Don't answer that!

33:52.767 --> 33:55.230
Mr Bloom, I warned you.
Read them their rights.

33:55.270 --> 33:57.223
–Big mouth!
–Peasant!

33:57.243 --> 34:00.346
I will not allow you to
pit them against one another

34:00.386 --> 34:02.099
by interrogating them individually.

34:02.139 --> 34:04.172
A group therapy session
sounds fine to me,

34:04.212 --> 34:07.696
but someone is confessing
tomorrow, counselor,

34:07.716 --> 34:09.696
and that's all there is to it.

34:12.210 --> 34:15.989
Do you realize what I had
to sleep on last night?

34:17.759 --> 34:19.018
You guys ever shut up?

34:19.059 --> 34:19.879
Never.

34:19.909 --> 34:22.068
–Stop with that pen.
–Screw you, Den.

34:22.108 --> 34:24.418
Stop it. Just the two of you stop it.

34:24.458 --> 34:26.016
Thank you, sarge…

34:27.678 --> 34:29.157
Thank you, sergeant.

34:29.197 --> 34:31.726
Detective. Lieutenant.

34:31.797 --> 34:32.867
This is deputy chief.

34:32.907 --> 34:34.266
Get your feet off the furniture.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.536
What is Mr Yates doing here?

34:36.576 --> 34:39.282
I'll explain that in
a minute, but first…

34:40.676 --> 34:43.126
I'm going to make some assumptions.

34:43.156 --> 34:45.846
I'm going to assume that
whoever murdered Albert

34:45.886 --> 34:47.065
also murdered Angelina,

34:47.105 --> 34:49.675
and that's a good assumption
for your clients, Mr Bloom,

34:49.715 --> 34:51.534
because if I'm right,
that'll be more money

34:51.574 --> 34:54.185
for the innocent to split between them.

34:54.235 --> 34:56.164
Really?

34:56.554 --> 34:57.864
Is that a rule or something?

34:57.904 --> 34:59.454
No, it's a law, you idiot!

34:59.494 --> 35:02.024
Listen, carefully…
Listen, carefully…

35:02.073 --> 35:05.713
Quiet! Now listen to me. This isn't…

35:05.743 --> 35:09.502
Listen! This is not something
you can just laugh off.

35:09.502 --> 35:13.002
Whoever committed these crimes,
did so with careful thought.

35:13.042 --> 35:15.822
Which rules you out.

35:15.852 --> 35:18.291
Which means, it is murder

35:18.322 --> 35:20.191
with special circumstances.

35:20.221 --> 35:22.051
It could lead to the death penalty.

35:22.091 --> 35:24.120
Your lives could be at stake.

35:24.140 --> 35:29.130
So… when I ask you to be quiet,

35:29.169 --> 35:30.790
let me talk,

35:30.810 --> 35:33.579
please oblige me.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.188
Thank you.

35:37.188 --> 35:38.708
We've already verified

35:38.748 --> 35:41.398
that Deanna was sequestered
at a rehab in Malibu

35:41.438 --> 35:43.767
when Albert's murder took place.

35:43.787 --> 35:45.038
Yay. So I can go?

35:45.068 --> 35:47.857
No, no, no. Because that
doesn't rule out conspiracy,

35:47.897 --> 35:49.776
and unfortunately we found lots

35:49.816 --> 35:52.077
and lots of vicodin in Albert,

35:52.106 --> 35:53.747
and when we served our search warrant,

35:53.787 --> 35:55.946
Deanna, looking for drugs, we found

35:55.986 --> 35:58.476
lots and lots of vicodin in your house.

35:58.516 --> 36:02.755
Wait. You took my refills?
I just got those yesterday.

36:02.785 --> 36:04.275
So how do we know you didn't pass off

36:04.315 --> 36:05.604
those pills to your brothers

36:05.644 --> 36:07.205
and they didn't use them to drug Albert?

36:07.245 --> 36:09.594
Well, for one thing, Deanna
won't share drugs with anyone.

36:09.634 --> 36:12.453
Dennis, be quiet. Be quiet.

36:12.484 --> 36:14.503
You can know it wasn't Deanna's vicodin

36:14.543 --> 36:17.073
because I removed all
the drugs from her house

36:17.113 --> 36:19.802
last month when I
dropped her off at rehab.

36:19.842 --> 36:21.462
Just like I did the month before

36:21.502 --> 36:22.602
and the month before that.

36:22.642 --> 36:24.712
It's a little ritual we go through,

36:24.752 --> 36:28.582
and I will testify to that in court.

36:29.562 --> 36:31.972
Well, that's good enough
for me, then Deanna.

36:32.012 --> 36:34.352
You go wait in the hallway.

36:37.281 --> 36:40.650
Uncle James, if it's a matter of alibis,

36:40.680 --> 36:41.780
I've already provided one.

36:41.820 --> 36:44.210
Yes, but you've also proven

36:44.260 --> 36:45.570
that you had the pass codes

36:45.610 --> 36:46.840
to the gates in your house,

36:46.880 --> 36:49.279
so you could get in and out.

36:49.299 --> 36:52.069
May I ask a question
that goes to motive?

36:52.089 --> 36:55.559
Why would Devlin kill the family butler?

36:55.599 --> 36:57.548
If Albert overdosed Angelina,

36:57.558 --> 36:59.947
he also made the
children fabulously rich.

36:59.987 --> 37:02.927
Well, how's this for motive?

37:02.958 --> 37:06.527
Albert migh've known who
actually murdered Angelina.

37:06.567 --> 37:07.536
He might've been bribed to keep

37:07.576 --> 37:09.167
that information to himself,

37:09.207 --> 37:11.386
and to suffer through a murder trial

37:11.426 --> 37:13.526
that he was promised he would win.

37:13.566 --> 37:16.715
And then, Albert might
have changed his mind.

37:16.765 --> 37:19.145
He might've decided that the deal

37:19.185 --> 37:21.705
that was being offered by
Mr Yates wasn't so bad,

37:21.745 --> 37:23.514
and the person he was
protecting might have thought,

37:23.554 --> 37:25.715
“Gee, looks like Albert's
getting cold feet.

37:25.755 --> 37:27.284
”Maybe I should hang him from a flagpole

37:27.324 --> 37:29.314
on the back terrace. "

37:29.734 --> 37:31.473
So you have an alibi, yes,

37:31.513 --> 37:32.924
but who's to say that you didn't give

37:32.964 --> 37:35.513
those pass codes to Dennis
and let him do your dirty work?

37:35.553 --> 37:37.922
Devlin did not have the pass codes.

37:37.942 --> 37:39.202
He was able to get into the gate

37:39.242 --> 37:41.222
because he stole the remote control

37:41.262 --> 37:42.522
when you found Albert's body.

37:42.562 --> 37:45.212
He only gave it back to me
after Dennis shot at him.

37:45.252 --> 37:46.321
And I suppose you'd be willing

37:46.361 --> 37:48.490
to swear to that in court as well?

37:48.530 --> 37:50.670
I would.

37:51.260 --> 37:53.350
Well, then, Devlin,

37:53.500 --> 37:56.210
you can wait in the
hallway with your sister.

37:56.250 --> 38:00.189
Heh. Looks like you're
left with Dennis the menace.

38:05.778 --> 38:08.909
So, Mr Dutton…

38:08.969 --> 38:12.339
last Friday, 2 days
before Albert was killed,

38:12.369 --> 38:15.858
$5 million was wired into your
bank account in Switzerland.

38:15.898 --> 38:17.178
Where did that money come from?

38:17.218 --> 38:19.158
Don't answer that.

38:19.198 --> 38:20.678
No, really, uncle James,

38:20.718 --> 38:24.596
I think just this once
you should let me explain.

38:24.627 --> 38:26.597
Absolutely not.

38:26.626 --> 38:28.776
Chief Johnson, Mr Yates,

38:28.806 --> 38:33.135
after the distressing incident
involving his ex-girlfriend,

38:33.155 --> 38:37.015
Dennis was never allowed direct
access to company funds again.

38:37.055 --> 38:38.485
His father wouldn't allow it,

38:38.525 --> 38:41.444
therefore I had to be
responsible for all transactions

38:41.484 --> 38:44.594
to and from his accounts.

38:44.624 --> 38:47.004
And would you agree to sign this waiver

38:47.044 --> 38:49.983
allowing us to check
the validity of that?

38:50.233 --> 38:51.969
Happily.

39:01.258 --> 39:03.008
Well, then, Mr Dutton,

39:03.018 --> 39:06.567
would you mind waiting
outside for a moment, please?

39:07.017 --> 39:08.586
Of course.

39:10.226 --> 39:10.986
Really, uncle James,

39:11.026 --> 39:13.930
I'd forgotten how good
you were at all this.

39:20.132 --> 39:21.541
Congratulations, sir.

39:21.933 --> 39:24.241
Once again, you've
helped a murderer go free.

39:24.281 --> 39:26.752
Well, not exactly.

39:26.823 --> 39:28.434
If you'd been listening carefully,

39:28.474 --> 39:31.806
actually, someone just confessed.

39:33.527 --> 39:35.268
Who?

39:35.419 --> 39:37.600
Why, Mr Bloom.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.472
Excuse me.

39:40.641 --> 39:42.713
To what did I just confess?

39:42.754 --> 39:44.555
To the murder of Albert Turner.

39:44.595 --> 39:45.565
Because, thanks to you,

39:45.605 --> 39:49.037
the Dutton children all have
concrete, unbreakable alibis.

39:49.077 --> 39:54.461
And you are the only one left with
the motive, means, and opportunity.

39:56.253 --> 39:58.384
My god.

39:58.875 --> 40:02.156
You took the pills from Deanna's house.

40:02.217 --> 40:06.659
Only you and Albert had
the pass codes to the gate.

40:06.699 --> 40:07.830
And you just admitted

40:07.870 --> 40:08.781
that you were the only person

40:08.821 --> 40:12.293
who could transfer money into
and out of Dennis's account,

40:12.333 --> 40:13.395
and you signed this waiver,

40:13.435 --> 40:15.095
allowing us to check
the validity of that.

40:15.135 --> 40:18.117
So… what do you want to bet

40:18.146 --> 40:20.659
we discover that you
gave Albert $5 million?

40:20.699 --> 40:22.650
That was an advance on his inheritance.

40:22.690 --> 40:25.232
Then why did you take it away?

40:25.282 --> 40:27.983
After Mr Yates here
offered Albert a deal,

40:28.023 --> 40:30.315
you transferred that money
out of Albert's account

40:30.355 --> 40:31.706
and into one held by Dennis,

40:31.746 --> 40:32.736
and why would you have done that

40:32.776 --> 40:36.039
unless you knew Albert was going to die?

40:38.900 --> 40:41.061
You are the one who made the assumption

40:41.101 --> 40:43.454
that whoever killed Albert
also killed Angelina.

40:43.494 --> 40:45.704
It was the children who had the motive

40:45.744 --> 40:47.786
to benefit from her death, not me.

40:47.826 --> 40:49.577
Everyone lost out in that last will.

40:49.617 --> 40:50.978
You said so in my office.

40:51.018 --> 40:52.098
So I checked it out.

40:52.138 --> 40:54.280
Angelina was liquidating the company,

40:54.320 --> 40:56.813
hiring all new attorneys.

40:56.851 --> 41:00.834
You spent your entire
life… how did you put it?

41:00.945 --> 41:03.866
Straightening up after the Duttons,

41:03.886 --> 41:06.428
always around the family,
but never really part of it.

41:06.468 --> 41:08.309
That's hard, I know.

41:08.329 --> 41:11.082
But killing people, Mr Bloom?

41:11.122 --> 41:13.373
Maybe a real Dutton could
get away with murder,

41:13.413 --> 41:15.224
but not you.

41:16.285 --> 41:19.477
Now, you're a good attorney.

41:19.497 --> 41:22.329
You know what we're going to find.

41:23.800 --> 41:26.661
I'm gonna trace all these cash transfers

41:26.682 --> 41:28.793
to and from Albert..

41:28.932 --> 41:31.054
right back to you.

41:31.224 --> 41:33.062
Aren't I, James?

41:39.802 --> 41:43.591
Will you take the death
penalty off of the table?

41:43.721 --> 41:47.901
If you confess to
both murders right now.

41:54.617 --> 41:57.594
The only thing I really regret,

41:57.643 --> 41:58.756
besides killing Albert.

41:58.796 --> 42:00.314
That… that was too bad.

42:00.330 --> 42:03.627
I'm… I'm gonna miss him.

42:04.940 --> 42:07.125
But I'm really sorry

42:07.135 --> 42:08.949
that I never got the opportunity

42:08.989 --> 42:12.619
to knock off those horrible children.

42:19.394 --> 42:22.193
Is there a chance I
could plead insanity?

42:31.496 --> 42:33.823
Do you mind?

42:35.211 --> 42:36.649
No.

42:41.213 --> 42:43.481
Well, um…

42:45.029 --> 42:48.864
I just wanted to say that despite
the somewhat unusual circumstances

42:48.904 --> 42:51.940
that I've enjoyed our time together.

42:52.509 --> 42:55.645
Hard to imagine uncle James
gave himself away like that.

42:55.685 --> 42:57.343
Of course, he's not a real uncle.

42:57.383 --> 42:58.950
It's just a term of endearment, really.

42:58.990 --> 43:02.176
Yeah, you seem like the real
endearing type, I can tell.

43:02.216 --> 43:05.013
Do I detect a touch of sarcasm?

43:05.033 --> 43:07.410
Well, perhaps you and I should
spend a little more time together.

43:07.450 --> 43:09.886
I might alter your opinion of me.

43:09.916 --> 43:13.122
I saw pictures of your last girlfriend.

43:13.152 --> 43:15.499
Kind of a big turn-off for me.

43:16.568 --> 43:22.761
Well, I guess that rumor
will always follow me around.

43:22.781 --> 43:24.998
It's a shame really.

43:25.427 --> 43:27.265
Wish you'd concentrated
on finding her killer

43:27.305 --> 43:30.780
as hard as you did finding
Albert's and Angelina's.

43:31.450 --> 43:33.397
How do you sleep at night, Mr Dutton?

43:33.437 --> 43:36.213
Sleep is overrated.

43:37.592 --> 43:42.136
Besides, I now have over 600
million new reasons to stay awake.

43:44.802 --> 43:49.356
You know, I realize we come
from very different worlds,

43:49.376 --> 43:53.521
but there are so few
people that I find…

43:53.561 --> 43:55.938
really interesting.

43:55.968 --> 43:58.295
Is it too much to hope

43:58.325 --> 44:02.829
that you and I might
cross paths again one day?

44:03.748 --> 44:07.233
Be careful what you
wish for, Mr Dutton.

44:09.760 --> 44:12.524
Till then, miss Johnson.
