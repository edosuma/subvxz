00:24.676 --> 00:27.810
They're going to miss my
perfect packing presentation.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.116
Huh?

00:29.159 --> 00:31.161
My perfect packing presentation.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.336
Your what?

00:32.380 --> 00:35.818
Perfect! Packing!

00:35.861 --> 00:38.864
Presentation!

00:38.908 --> 00:41.693
I'm going to show you all how
to pack your bags perfectly

00:41.737 --> 00:44.131
for the big road trip tomorrow.

00:44.174 --> 00:45.871
Bruh, we knows how to pack.

00:45.915 --> 00:48.396
All you know is how to
throw junk into a bag.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.180
It's sloppy and dangerous.

00:50.224 --> 00:53.096
Don't you remember

01:14.509 --> 01:16.293
Yeah, but look at us now.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.123
I'm done waiting for those two.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.821
My perfect packing
presentation starts now.

01:22.865 --> 01:24.388
This better not be boring.

01:24.432 --> 01:28.044
I think you shall find it
to be quite the opposite.

01:32.483 --> 01:36.183
Yo, yo, yo!
What's up, Titans Tower?

01:36.226 --> 01:38.359
Y'all having a good time?

01:39.969 --> 01:43.103
I can't hear you!

01:43.146 --> 01:45.540
That's what I'm talking 'bout!

01:45.583 --> 01:48.325
Hey, you kids think
packing ain't cool?

01:48.369 --> 01:50.197
Packing is for grandmas, right?

01:50.240 --> 01:51.763
Wrong.

01:51.807 --> 01:55.550
Packing is the new
funky fresh way to be, boy-ee!

01:55.593 --> 01:57.247
Let's open this bad boy up,

01:57.291 --> 01:59.423
and find out how to fold shirts

01:59.467 --> 02:01.643
so they can take up less space.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.036
Hello!

02:04.080 --> 02:06.865
You have found our hiding spot
with your seeking.

02:06.909 --> 02:09.477
I'm in the middle of my
perfect packing presentation.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.349
Forget that, dude.
You're the big winner!

02:16.136 --> 02:18.660
Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech!

02:18.703 --> 02:21.445
I can't believe it.
It's finally happening.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.099
This is such an honor.

02:24.883 --> 02:27.799
To think I started out
as just a little...

02:27.843 --> 02:31.151
Just a little circus boy,
alone and misunderstood.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.937
He thinks that trophy is real.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.376
You two need to grow up!

02:39.420 --> 02:42.249
He does not believe we are
the fully grown adult persons.

02:42.292 --> 02:43.989
What?

02:44.033 --> 02:45.077
Please.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.601
Huh?

02:53.042 --> 02:54.130
Uh-uh.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.653
Uh-huh!

02:55.697 --> 02:58.352
We are grown-ups, bro.
You don't even know.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.747
Uh-oh. Beast Boy.

03:02.791 --> 03:05.663
Aw. You need to go
potty, potty, potty?

03:06.316 --> 03:08.144
I'll take you.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.711
The potty, potty, potty
can wait!

03:09.754 --> 03:12.496
We are leaving for a road trip
tomorrow at 5:00 AM sharp.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.281
I want everyone in bed ASAP.

03:14.324 --> 03:17.501
Bags packed perfectly, so we're
ready to go in the morning.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.373
And you two, right to bed!

03:19.416 --> 03:21.679
Show me you can be adults, okay?

03:21.723 --> 03:23.986
- You got it.
- Understood.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.860
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

03:30.122 --> 03:31.776
Quack, quack, quack.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.169
Quack, quack, quack.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.353
Go to sleep!

03:43.397 --> 03:47.227
How can we? With these crazy
birds making all this racket?

03:47.270 --> 03:49.272
You are making those noises!

03:50.926 --> 03:54.103
Quiet down, you dog!
We're trying to sleep.

03:55.539 --> 03:58.238
Oh! Shush-shush, Mr. Horsey.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.500
Grow up!

04:22.784 --> 04:24.655
Those filthy animals kept me
up all night and I overslept.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.701
We're late!
Get a move on, Titans.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.659
Up and at 'em!
Come on, let's go.

04:29.965 --> 04:33.925
I just want to go back to bed.

04:33.969 --> 04:36.276
Come on, come on, come on. Let's
get this show on the road.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.365
Beast Boy, give me a headcount.

04:38.408 --> 04:42.282
One, two, three, four, five.
Five heads.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.501
Good, we're all here.
Let's get this road trip started.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.764
We got to make up some time.

04:51.769 --> 04:55.469
The good morning to you.
Friend Titans?

04:55.512 --> 04:58.080
Hello? Friend Titans?

04:59.647 --> 05:02.084
Cyborg, the other
Titans are gone!

05:02.127 --> 05:03.651
Well, there's no way
they would've forgotten us.

05:03.694 --> 05:06.306
Perhaps they were eaten
by the monsters?

05:06.349 --> 05:08.046
- Monsters?
- Yes.

05:08.090 --> 05:11.311
The monsters in the closet
and under the beds.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.791
From the shadows they crept...

05:13.835 --> 05:17.578
And they used their horrible
monster mouths to swallow them whole.

05:19.841 --> 05:22.104
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness!

05:22.147 --> 05:23.540
What are we gonna do?

05:23.584 --> 05:26.543
Friend Robin said
we need to up our ages.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.153
And prove that
we can be grown-ups.

05:28.197 --> 05:31.026
Then let us make our dearly
departed friend Robin proud

05:31.069 --> 05:34.290
by protecting ourselves and
the Tower from the monsters,

05:34.334 --> 05:36.118
by becoming the adults.

05:36.161 --> 05:38.642
So, how do adults protect
themselves from monsters?

05:40.383 --> 05:41.645
Booby traps!

06:03.188 --> 06:04.364
Shh...

06:26.647 --> 06:29.606
Oh, no! We forgot them!

06:29.650 --> 06:34.350
- You mean...
- Yes! We forgot the tangerines.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.873
The tangerines!

06:35.917 --> 06:37.179
Tangerines!

06:37.222 --> 06:39.616
How could we overlook
something so obvious?

06:39.660 --> 06:41.444
I'm starting to panic!

06:41.488 --> 06:42.837
I'm panicking, too.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.012
Tangerines!

06:44.055 --> 06:45.405
I need some Vitamin C.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.494
Ahhh!
I think I got scurvy, yo.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.713
Tangerines.

06:49.757 --> 06:52.150
Oh, we'll never survive
out here.

06:52.194 --> 06:53.543
Oh. Here they are.

06:57.721 --> 07:01.246
Dear madam,
say hello to my speciality,

07:01.290 --> 07:05.120
sweet meat lasagna.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.078
Ooh! The fancy.

07:07.122 --> 07:12.170
Let us enjoy this adult-style
meal in the style of the adults.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.869
Check me out, using a napkin.

07:16.392 --> 07:18.916
And I am using the utensils.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.485
Lovely. This is edamame.

07:22.529 --> 07:26.315
With a fine chocolate
cherry reduction.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.448
Eba-da-mame is my favorite.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.016
Excellent.

07:32.060 --> 07:35.803
Here, refresh your palatay
with this fizzy water.

07:35.846 --> 07:38.196
I do enjoy the fizzy water.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.676
Don't ask how it got fizzy.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.765
How did it get fizzy?

07:41.809 --> 07:44.464
I said not to ask.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.779
We're here.

07:55.823 --> 07:58.608
Sweet. That car was
smelling rank, yo.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.131
Whose fault was that?

08:00.175 --> 08:02.612
Oh, mine.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.180
Beast Boy,
wake up Starfire and Cyborg.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.662
Guys?

08:09.227 --> 08:11.099
Star? Cyborg?

08:11.142 --> 08:12.274
Where you at?

08:12.840 --> 08:14.189
Bro?

08:14.232 --> 08:15.538
Huh.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.366
They're not in the car.

08:17.409 --> 08:20.630
What? How did you two
not notice that until now?

08:20.674 --> 08:22.806
I don't know how
it could've slipped by me.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.765
They must be alone in the Tower.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.550
We have to get home before they
destroy the place or hurt themselves.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.210
Oh, the tum-tum is on the fire.

08:35.253 --> 08:38.082
Perhaps the candied lasagna,
eda-ba-mame,

08:38.126 --> 08:41.738
and the fizzy water were not
the best of the ideas.

08:41.782 --> 08:45.568
Being a grown-up
is much harder than it looks.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.745
The monsters!

08:48.789 --> 08:50.355
They're going to eat us!

08:54.403 --> 08:55.578
Who are we kidding?

08:55.622 --> 08:56.927
We don't know how
to be grown-ups.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.973
Are our booby traps
even gonna work?

08:59.016 --> 09:01.758
We must try, Cyborg.
It is time...

09:02.629 --> 09:04.152
To adult.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.196
Boo-ya!

09:05.240 --> 09:07.764
Come on, come on,
come on. Huh?

09:10.506 --> 09:12.813
Oh, come on!

09:19.907 --> 09:22.431
You will not eat us,
the monsters!

09:22.474 --> 09:24.172
Let's get grown up.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.397
D'oh!

10:07.476 --> 10:08.738
Ah!

10:22.447 --> 10:25.842
We did it! We saved the Tower
from those horrible monsters.

10:25.886 --> 10:28.410
We are truly the grown people.
