00:03.600 --> 00:07.265
Captain's log, stardate 45397.3.

00:07.395 --> 00:12.519
Two days ago, Starbase 514 lost
contact with the research vessel Vico

00:12.649 --> 00:16.148
which was sent to explore
the Black Cluster.

00:16.277 --> 00:18.270
We are en route to investigate.

00:19.488 --> 00:21.611
Captain, we're entering Sector 97.

00:21.740 --> 00:24.575
I am picking up
gravitational fluctuations.

00:24.701 --> 00:27.239
- Take us out of warp, Ensign.
- Yes, sir.

00:27.370 --> 00:30.157
The Black Cluster
is within visual range.

00:30.289 --> 00:32.031
- On screen.
- Aye, sir.

00:35.585 --> 00:38.158
Let's find that ship.
Full sensor sweep.

00:38.296 --> 00:39.790
Aye, sir.

00:39.922 --> 00:41.713
What a sight.

00:41.841 --> 00:44.924
One of the most ancient formations
in the galaxy.

00:45.093 --> 00:48.296
I have located the Vico.
It appears to be adrift.

00:48.430 --> 00:49.924
Let's see it.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.067 --> 01:06.186
- Life signs?
- Nothing, Commander.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.862
Damage report, Mr Data?

01:07.988 --> 01:10.443
Outer and inner hulls
have been breached.

01:10.573 --> 01:13.194
Decks seven to 12
are exposed to space.

01:13.326 --> 01:16.326
Set up a translink
to their computer core.

01:16.453 --> 01:20.237
I cannot.
The emergency bulkheads are in place.

01:20.373 --> 01:22.745
Our signal cannot penetrate them.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.500
Structural status?

01:24.627 --> 01:28.244
Stress readings indicate pressure
on the transfer supports.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.289
Stable enough for an away team?

01:30.423 --> 01:33.874
Yes, sir, but the risk of collapse
is high.

01:34.010 --> 01:38.837
Have transporter room one
maintain a lock on the away team.

01:38.972 --> 01:42.886
Take us to 15,000 metres.
Data, you're with me.

03:14.970 --> 03:17.093
This station is inoperable, sir.

03:17.222 --> 03:21.433
- This one is stuck in a loop.
- Tap into the computer.

03:21.559 --> 03:23.847
The ODN junction is down here.

03:34.778 --> 03:35.692
Data?

03:41.159 --> 03:43.032
Core transfer is engaged.

03:44.078 --> 03:46.450
Exchange protocol verified.

03:46.580 --> 03:49.746
The files are intact.
At least, some of them.

03:53.044 --> 03:55.036
Stay here, Geordi. Data.

05:00.976 --> 05:04.012
Space, the final frontier.

05:05.689 --> 05:09.768
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

05:09.900 --> 05:14.147
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

05:15.238 --> 05:18.773
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

05:19.951 --> 05:23.782
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

06:21.127 --> 06:23.167
Captain's log, supplemental.

06:23.296 --> 06:25.869
A young boy,
shielded from sensor scans,

06:26.006 --> 06:29.126
has been discovered
pinned beneath a fallen beam.

06:29.259 --> 06:33.126
The damage to the Vico
is making rescue difficult.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.264
Transporter room one,

06:37.391 --> 06:40.178
can you transport him directly
to sickbay?

06:40.310 --> 06:44.142
I'll try, Captain.
But there's a lot of shielding.

06:44.814 --> 06:46.972
Acknowledged. Picard to Crusher.

06:47.942 --> 06:49.270
Sickbay here, Captain.

06:49.401 --> 06:52.520
- Prepare for emergency transport.
- Yes, sir.

06:52.654 --> 06:54.646
- Crusher out.
- Picard to Riker.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.405
Is the boy ready?

06:56.532 --> 06:59.023
- Ready, sir.
- It's your signal.

06:59.159 --> 07:00.701
Aye, Captain.

07:00.828 --> 07:02.950
It's going to be OK.

07:03.788 --> 07:05.448
Here we go.

07:09.251 --> 07:10.532
Energise.

07:16.090 --> 07:19.673
- Ensign, do we have him?
- The lock is holding.

07:19.802 --> 07:22.921
I just can't resolve
the matter stream,

07:23.055 --> 07:25.379
not with all that victurium alloy.

07:30.436 --> 07:32.843
Cmdr Riker,
get him into the corridor.

07:32.980 --> 07:34.438
I could move the beam.

07:34.564 --> 07:37.767
But it may initiate
the collapse of the supports.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.893
I recommend you and Geordi return.

07:43.447 --> 07:45.273
Agreed. La Forge.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.703
I'm locked onto them.

08:00.837 --> 08:03.505
I'll energise
once they clear the bulkheads.

08:03.631 --> 08:05.837
- Whenever you're ready.
- Yes, sir.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.675
Are you gonna lift that?

08:09.719 --> 08:12.922
Yes.
Then I will take you to the corridor.

08:13.055 --> 08:15.925
We will transport
to the Enterprise from there.

08:16.600 --> 08:20.264
- How can you pick that up?
- I am an android.

08:20.395 --> 08:23.265
My strength is many times
that of a human.

08:24.482 --> 08:27.055
It is going to be OK.

08:33.864 --> 08:38.442
I will count to three.
One, two, three.

08:52.922 --> 08:54.202
Energise.

09:06.267 --> 09:07.595
Don't be afraid.

09:11.563 --> 09:13.390
Captain's log, supplemental.

09:13.523 --> 09:17.022
A search of the Vico has revealed
no additional survivors.

09:17.151 --> 09:20.816
We have begun counselling the boy
about the tragedy.

09:22.906 --> 09:25.194
We were in the Black Cluster.

09:27.535 --> 09:30.025
I don't know where they came from.

09:32.622 --> 09:34.247
They had a big ship.

09:36.918 --> 09:39.455
They kept shooting at us.

09:39.587 --> 09:41.709
Then they beamed over.

09:41.839 --> 09:45.883
They had purple helmets on
and phaser rifles.

09:48.511 --> 09:51.084
I saw them. They didn't see me.

09:51.221 --> 09:53.510
You're safe now, Timothy.

09:53.640 --> 09:57.091
I'm sorry for what happened.
It's gonna be alright.

09:58.186 --> 10:02.052
I bet you're hungry.
Would you like something to eat?

10:09.904 --> 10:12.395
I must join La Forge in Engineering.

10:12.531 --> 10:14.191
If you will excuse me.

10:17.285 --> 10:20.985
Timothy, would you like Data
to stay a little longer?

10:33.591 --> 10:37.339
Sections of the primary
and secondary hulls were torn off.

10:37.469 --> 10:40.672
The shearing planes
are here, here and here.

10:44.016 --> 10:47.266
How much longer
till we can access their logs?

10:47.394 --> 10:48.852
Almost an hour.

10:55.484 --> 10:57.061
The boy was here.

10:57.194 --> 11:00.313
The hallway outside
the computer core.

11:00.447 --> 11:02.984
His mother was the systems engineer.

11:03.116 --> 11:07.278
The second away team
found her body inside the core.

11:07.828 --> 11:10.365
- And his father?
- Ship's second officer.

11:10.497 --> 11:14.541
He was most likely on the bridge
when it was exposed to space.

11:16.919 --> 11:18.543
Most likely.

11:30.931 --> 11:33.338
He'll sleep for a few hours at least.

11:34.976 --> 11:39.103
I don't need to keep him here
but I need to see him tomorrow.

11:41.398 --> 11:44.482
You've got your work cut out for you.

11:51.323 --> 11:56.068
His world is gone. We have to
help him build a new one.

12:03.917 --> 12:06.953
This is not good.
Whatever hit the Vico

12:07.086 --> 12:10.585
set up an EM pulse that flashed
through their computer banks.

12:10.714 --> 12:13.964
Nearly 83 percent of their records
have been lost.

12:14.092 --> 12:15.586
All their sensor logs.

12:15.719 --> 12:18.589
Let's use what we got
from our own sensors.

12:18.721 --> 12:22.588
I'll call up the structural analysis
and the surface scans.

12:26.478 --> 12:33.013
Geordi, as a child, did you ever
experience a traumatic event?

12:36.987 --> 12:39.857
- You're wondering about Timothy?
- Yes.

12:54.293 --> 12:58.041
I was caught in a fire once.

12:59.464 --> 13:05.217
I must have been,
I don't know, about five, I guess.

13:05.344 --> 13:08.048
It was before I got the first visor.

13:08.722 --> 13:14.759
And it was only a couple of minutes
before my parents pulled me out.

13:15.978 --> 13:20.141
And nobody got hurt,
but I tell you...

13:21.983 --> 13:25.850
...that was the longest
couple of minutes of my life.

13:28.655 --> 13:33.696
It was a while before I could let
my parents get out of earshot.

13:35.161 --> 13:42.076
It was like I absolutely needed
to know that they were there,

13:42.208 --> 13:43.619
you know?

13:46.921 --> 13:49.672
Timothy no longer has that support.

13:49.798 --> 13:50.794
Yeah.

13:54.552 --> 13:58.134
"Dara and her brother
found themselves in Tagas,

13:58.264 --> 14:02.095
where the ruler, Elamos the
Magnificent, proclaimed as law,

14:02.225 --> 14:05.724
No children will be tolerated
within the great kingdom."

14:05.853 --> 14:09.103
"When Dara saw the proclamation,
she laughed and said,

14:09.231 --> 14:13.062
How magnificent a ruler,
to be frightened by us!"

14:14.152 --> 14:17.983
- We're done with sculpture.
- It's not finished.

14:20.741 --> 14:24.785
We'll come back to it.
Why not pick up your mythology book?

14:25.286 --> 14:26.911
But it's not finished.

14:37.588 --> 14:41.087
Magnetic analysis confirms
the Vico was definitely attacked

14:41.216 --> 14:42.758
inside the Black Cluster.

14:42.885 --> 14:46.300
Graviton wave fronts pushed it
to where we found it.

14:46.429 --> 14:49.632
- No signs of phaser burns?
- No, sir.

14:49.765 --> 14:53.632
Torsional-stress levels point
to a disruptor-style weapon.

14:55.479 --> 14:59.558
Fracture points indicate
a range of less than 3,000 metres.

15:00.816 --> 15:04.516
That's a strategy
consistent with a cloaked vessel.

15:05.195 --> 15:07.234
Romulan.

15:07.364 --> 15:10.814
Or Klingon. But we're
a distance from their territories.

15:10.950 --> 15:13.275
The Breen have outposts
in this sector.

15:13.410 --> 15:18.072
The attack is consistent with their
battle tactics and their technology.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.541
Thank you.

15:22.585 --> 15:27.246
But what would the Breen be doing
inside the Black Cluster?

15:28.215 --> 15:33.125
The boy described a boarding party
with helmets and phaser rifles.

15:33.260 --> 15:36.344
Boarding party?
I don't think that's likely, sir.

15:36.471 --> 15:37.752
Counsellor.

15:39.724 --> 15:42.890
There was no evidence of anyone
coming aboard the Vico.

15:43.019 --> 15:45.141
We'd have a transporter-field trace.

15:45.271 --> 15:46.978
Or in the entry ports,

15:47.105 --> 15:51.814
we would have found an electrostatic
differential, and we didn't.

15:51.943 --> 15:54.101
Could Timothy have imagined that?

15:54.236 --> 15:56.443
Or could he be lying?

15:57.531 --> 16:00.282
If he's lying, I haven't sensed it.

16:00.408 --> 16:03.325
Perhaps his emotional-trauma level
is too high.

16:03.453 --> 16:05.409
Why wouldn't he tell the truth?

16:05.538 --> 16:10.033
He's in shock. It's hard to know
what's going on in his mind.

16:10.167 --> 16:13.915
I'll check the readings again,
but we won't find anything.

16:14.045 --> 16:15.954
- Thank you, Geordi.
- Data.

16:18.674 --> 16:22.291
Captain, we should ask Data
to spend time with him.

16:22.844 --> 16:26.426
- I do not understand.
- I'm worried about his behaviour.

16:26.555 --> 16:29.924
What I just heard
doesn't make me feel better.

16:30.058 --> 16:33.972
You're the only one
he's reached out to. You rescued him.

16:34.104 --> 16:36.677
We can use your relationship
to help him.

16:36.814 --> 16:40.432
Would Timothy be inclined
to tell Data the truth?

16:40.567 --> 16:42.394
It's a possibility.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.857
Proceed with Timothy
as the Counsellor suggests.

16:47.990 --> 16:49.484
Aye, sir.

16:51.368 --> 16:54.369
Counsellor,
exactly how shall I proceed?

16:54.496 --> 16:57.033
Just be with him.

16:57.165 --> 17:01.078
Your presence he trusts.
That's what he needs most now.

17:16.388 --> 17:17.503
What?

17:20.268 --> 17:21.382
Data.

17:21.519 --> 17:23.760
Hello, Timothy. May I enter?

17:23.896 --> 17:25.058
Yeah.

17:29.692 --> 17:31.731
You are attempting to recreate...

17:32.820 --> 17:35.145
...the Dokkaran temple
of Kural-Hanesh?

17:36.239 --> 17:38.113
Isn't it great?

17:38.241 --> 17:41.277
There's the big hallway
the teacher told us about.

17:41.410 --> 17:43.782
That's where everybody came in.

17:43.912 --> 17:47.162
That's where they stood.
That's where the altar was.

17:47.290 --> 17:48.950
What do you think?

17:52.878 --> 17:54.787
Do you wish a frank evaluation?

17:56.715 --> 18:01.376
It lacks the harmony of the temple,
and Dokkaran culture in general.

18:06.640 --> 18:11.218
- You hate it.
- No. I am not capable of hatred.

18:12.437 --> 18:14.144
I can't do anything right.

18:14.271 --> 18:17.023
You are making
an unwarranted extrapolation.

18:17.149 --> 18:20.600
I was offering an aesthetic analysis
of this model.

18:26.782 --> 18:28.691
The base appears quite sturdy.

18:44.672 --> 18:46.083
I told you!

18:46.215 --> 18:48.504
May I suggest a different approach?

18:48.634 --> 18:53.129
You were constructing the upper level
before the supports were in place.

18:53.263 --> 18:54.508
Observe.

18:55.598 --> 18:57.507
La Forge to Data.

18:58.184 --> 18:59.215
Data here.

18:59.351 --> 19:01.758
I need help with the modulators.

19:01.895 --> 19:04.350
I will join you in a moment.

19:04.481 --> 19:06.805
Lt La Forge requires my assistance.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.536
Incredible.

19:37.008 --> 19:38.206
Data.

19:40.428 --> 19:42.171
How come you can do that?

19:42.304 --> 19:46.136
I am designed to exceed human
capacity, mentally and physically.

19:46.266 --> 19:48.175
Androids are better than humans?

19:49.310 --> 19:51.931
"Better" is a highly subjective term.

19:52.062 --> 19:56.724
I do not possess the ability
to experience emotion as humans do.

19:59.736 --> 20:01.894
No emotions?

20:02.029 --> 20:05.528
You mean,
you can't be happy or sad?

20:06.450 --> 20:08.987
- That is correct.
- Why not?

20:09.702 --> 20:13.996
My positronic brain is not able
to generate those conditions.

20:14.998 --> 20:16.243
Goodbye.

20:20.670 --> 20:21.666
Data!

20:23.297 --> 20:26.002
Can we build something else later?

20:26.133 --> 20:27.793
That would be acceptable.

20:31.346 --> 20:32.460
Bye!

20:59.911 --> 21:02.616
I am designed
to exceed human capacity.

21:06.876 --> 21:08.535
That is correct.

21:17.593 --> 21:20.759
The Black Cluster was formed
nine billion years ago

21:20.887 --> 21:24.470
when hundreds of protostars collapsed
in close proximity.

21:24.599 --> 21:28.976
The gravitational forces
are both violent and unpredictable.

21:29.103 --> 21:30.645
To get near the centre,

21:30.771 --> 21:34.685
we have to push through
the graviton wave fronts.

21:34.816 --> 21:36.939
I've adjusted our shields.

21:37.068 --> 21:40.436
The gravitational forces
will affect sensor accuracy.

21:40.571 --> 21:43.322
Detecting an enemy vessel
will be difficult.

21:43.448 --> 21:47.148
Maybe the Vico didn't see anything
until it was too late.

21:47.285 --> 21:50.784
Counsellor, has the boy volunteered
any information?

21:50.913 --> 21:53.997
No, but I do have
an appointment with him.

21:54.124 --> 21:58.203
If there's a possibility of getting
more from him, pursue it.

21:58.336 --> 22:01.040
But we need to continue
our investigation.

22:01.172 --> 22:04.457
We'll enter the Black Cluster
at 0700 hours tomorrow.

22:04.591 --> 22:05.836
Dismissed.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.758
Hello, Timothy.
Are you ready to go?

22:16.893 --> 22:20.309
- Yes. I am ready.
- How are you feeling?

22:22.022 --> 22:24.774
I am functioning
within established parameters.

22:24.900 --> 22:28.268
Established parameters?
You sound like Data.

22:29.904 --> 22:31.528
I am an android.

22:32.698 --> 22:36.398
I see. Well, let's go for our walk,
shall we?

22:37.953 --> 22:39.779
That would be acceptable.

22:47.544 --> 22:49.453
So, what would you like?

22:54.341 --> 22:57.425
Androids do not need to eat or drink.

23:04.975 --> 23:07.976
However, we sometimes like
to taste things.

23:08.103 --> 23:11.472
A Tamarian frost, please.
Would you like anything?

23:11.606 --> 23:14.690
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- As you wish.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.851
So, you're no longer human?

23:20.447 --> 23:23.780
- I'm an android.
- When did this happen?

23:25.159 --> 23:27.151
I've always been an android.

23:27.953 --> 23:30.111
What's it like, being an android?

23:30.247 --> 23:32.868
I am designed
to exceed human capacity,

23:32.999 --> 23:35.324
both mentally and physically.

23:35.460 --> 23:40.287
- But I do not experience emotions.
- You don't? No emotion at all?

23:41.756 --> 23:43.132
That is correct.

23:43.758 --> 23:46.379
- An android?
- I know it sounds unusual.

23:46.511 --> 23:48.586
But it is understandable.

23:48.721 --> 23:51.342
Technically,
it's called enantiodromia,

23:51.473 --> 23:53.382
conversion into the opposite.

23:53.516 --> 23:56.636
Timothy went from human to machine,

23:56.769 --> 23:59.342
from being emotional
to being emotionless.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.267
But the underlying trauma
is still there.

24:02.399 --> 24:05.316
He's just found
a new way to suppress it.

24:07.612 --> 24:08.940
Counsellor.

24:10.322 --> 24:13.358
How long will this behaviour last?

24:13.492 --> 24:18.449
As long as he needs it to.
Timothy is rebuilding his identity.

24:18.871 --> 24:22.951
The android persona
is just one step along the way.

24:23.083 --> 24:26.950
As soon as he feels stronger,
it should drop away.

24:27.420 --> 24:30.919
This is not the time
to confront him about his ship?

24:31.048 --> 24:33.373
Not yet. The best thing we can do now

24:33.509 --> 24:36.379
is let Timothy take us
where he wants to go.

24:36.511 --> 24:39.465
We should support the process,
even encourage it.

24:41.182 --> 24:46.092
Data, make Timothy
the best android he can possibly be.

25:03.951 --> 25:07.615
Timothy, your head movements
are counterproductive.

25:07.746 --> 25:10.830
- Can you be still?
- But you do it.

25:12.625 --> 25:16.669
The mechanisms in my neck
approximate human movements.

25:16.795 --> 25:19.961
I did not realise
the effect was so distracting.

25:20.090 --> 25:21.749
I like it.

25:27.012 --> 25:30.262
Data, are there any other androids
in Starfleet?

25:30.390 --> 25:33.509
No, I am the only one.

25:33.643 --> 25:35.600
How come you're not captain?

25:35.728 --> 25:39.595
My service record
does not yet warrant such a position.

25:41.608 --> 25:43.018
Data.

25:45.945 --> 25:49.111
What's the scariest thing
that ever happened to you?

25:49.239 --> 25:52.608
Fear is not a quality that I possess.

25:52.742 --> 25:55.778
- Because it's an emotion?
- Correct.

25:59.123 --> 26:02.871
But what if you had a nightmare?

26:03.001 --> 26:07.045
I have never had a nightmare.
I do not require sleep.

26:12.968 --> 26:14.378
Timothy.

26:15.136 --> 26:17.627
Are you having disturbing dreams?

26:21.016 --> 26:23.174
I do not require sleep.

26:35.987 --> 26:37.730
Is that satisfactory?

26:43.618 --> 26:44.994
It's perfect.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.527
Transfer circuits are functioning.

26:47.664 --> 26:51.079
- Within established parameters?
- Absolutely.

26:51.208 --> 26:54.292
Input processing,
pattern recognition,

26:54.419 --> 26:56.744
all within established parameters.

26:58.715 --> 27:00.256
Thank you, Doctor.

27:30.908 --> 27:34.858
- I ran out of red ochre.
- You may use mine.

27:35.329 --> 27:36.871
Thank you.

27:48.423 --> 27:51.128
Perhaps you should
return to your quarters.

27:52.093 --> 27:53.504
I'm fine.

27:55.638 --> 28:00.215
The mechanisms in my mouth
approximate human movements.

28:05.146 --> 28:06.889
That is not bad.

28:07.690 --> 28:09.183
Thank you.

28:15.112 --> 28:17.899
It is very expressive.

28:20.242 --> 28:21.866
Thank you.

28:21.993 --> 28:25.196
Is your painting
representative of something?

28:26.747 --> 28:28.740
It's just a painting.

28:32.502 --> 28:36.084
Timothy, you understand
that you may speak to me

28:36.214 --> 28:39.084
about anything you wish?
Any subject?

28:40.008 --> 28:41.384
I understand.

28:43.720 --> 28:49.722
At times, l, too, find it difficult
to share my thoughts with others.

28:49.850 --> 28:53.100
I am not always confident
that I express myself

28:53.228 --> 28:55.897
in a manner
which humans can comprehend.

28:56.022 --> 28:57.516
But I know...

29:44.605 --> 29:48.056
We are approaching the perimeter.
Picking up wave fronts.

29:48.817 --> 29:51.307
Engage forward shields 35 percent.

29:51.444 --> 29:52.689
Shields up.

29:58.033 --> 30:00.523
- Drop to one-quarter impulse.
- Yes, sir.

30:07.374 --> 30:08.749
Bridge to Engineering.

30:10.335 --> 30:12.411
Adjusting shield frequencies now.

30:12.545 --> 30:15.545
We'll have this smoothed out
in just a second.

30:24.764 --> 30:27.433
- Adjust course for any deviations.
- Yes, sir.

30:27.558 --> 30:29.799
- Resume one-third impulse.
- Captain.

30:29.935 --> 30:33.635
I am reading something at 400,000
kilometres off starboard.

30:33.771 --> 30:35.680
- Possibly a ship.
- Red alert!

30:37.274 --> 30:40.725
- Take us to visual range.
- Adjusting course.

30:40.861 --> 30:43.102
Sensor readings have disappeared.

30:43.571 --> 30:44.567
Wait!

30:45.406 --> 30:49.818
I have another reading at
400,000 kilometres off the port bow.

30:51.369 --> 30:55.414
It's gone. No.
It is back to starboard.

30:55.540 --> 30:57.995
The cluster
is distorting the sensors.

30:58.125 --> 31:01.790
We are picking up our echoes
reflecting off the wavefronts.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.747
Cancel red alert.

31:03.880 --> 31:06.453
Mr Worf, adjust sensors
to compensate.

31:06.591 --> 31:07.789
Aye.

31:09.301 --> 31:13.963
Sensor difficulties have been
reported, but never this extreme.

31:14.097 --> 31:16.718
That formation
is seven times more massive

31:16.849 --> 31:20.846
than any explored previously.
That could explain the difference.

31:21.728 --> 31:24.931
- Resume previous course.
- Yes, sir.

31:40.828 --> 31:42.238
He laughed.

31:42.371 --> 31:45.739
Yes. It's nice to see, isn't it?

31:45.874 --> 31:49.289
It is certainly not consistent
with his android persona.

31:49.752 --> 31:53.619
I'd say he's beginning
to let go of that fantasy.

31:54.298 --> 31:57.002
Then my work with him is done.

31:57.759 --> 32:00.925
No, I don't think it is, Data.

32:01.053 --> 32:04.801
A laugh is one step
in the right direction.

32:04.932 --> 32:07.303
We need to help him take more steps.

32:07.434 --> 32:08.844
How, Counsellor?

32:09.435 --> 32:13.895
I'd like you to talk to him
about your fascination with humanity.

32:14.690 --> 32:18.604
If you explain to Timothy
the appeal that humanity has for you,

32:18.735 --> 32:22.186
he might find it easier
to become a boy again.

32:35.374 --> 32:37.746
This is great. How is yours?

32:40.920 --> 32:44.336
The polysaccharides
in reaction with the carbon dioxide

32:44.465 --> 32:48.379
produces an unusual combination
of texture and effervescence.

32:48.885 --> 32:52.088
But how does it taste? Is it good?

32:52.972 --> 32:56.388
I am not capable of tasting
in the manner you suggest.

32:56.517 --> 32:59.850
However, I can analyse
the composition of a dessert

32:59.978 --> 33:03.975
and make comparative conclusions
about its effect on the palate.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.776
But I neither like it nor dislike it.

33:08.819 --> 33:10.396
I didn't realise that.

33:10.529 --> 33:15.107
I often wonder what it must be like
to have one's mouth water

33:15.241 --> 33:18.158
in anticipation of a confection,

33:18.285 --> 33:22.033
or to feel the pleasure I observe
in humans as they consume it.

33:22.497 --> 33:25.616
You sound like
you don't want to be an android.

33:25.750 --> 33:29.450
I am an android.
That will never change.

33:33.381 --> 33:36.797
But if you could change, would you?

33:40.012 --> 33:42.550
I have often wished to be human.

33:42.681 --> 33:46.844
I study people in order to
approximate human behaviour.

33:46.976 --> 33:49.811
Why? We're stronger and smarter
than humans.

33:49.937 --> 33:51.764
We can do more.

33:51.897 --> 33:54.388
But I cannot take pride
in my abilities.

33:55.108 --> 33:58.192
I cannot take pleasure
in my accomplishments.

34:00.946 --> 34:03.615
But we never have to feel bad,
either.

34:06.159 --> 34:09.362
I would gladly risk
feeling bad at times

34:09.495 --> 34:13.991
if it also meant
that I could taste my dessert.

34:24.216 --> 34:27.964
Gravitational-wavefront intensity
is increasing steadily.

34:28.094 --> 34:30.382
1100 standard G units and rising.

34:36.935 --> 34:39.426
Let's see if anyone's out there.

34:40.188 --> 34:43.224
Mr Worf,
attempt a wide-range sensor sweep.

34:43.357 --> 34:44.732
Aye, sir.

34:46.525 --> 34:48.815
Gravitational distortion
is too great.

34:48.945 --> 34:52.277
The scanning signal
is again being reflected.

34:52.907 --> 34:56.774
I'm unable to compensate.
The sensors are useless.

34:56.909 --> 34:59.579
- Mr Data to the bridge.
- Acknowledged.

34:59.704 --> 35:03.867
Adjust sensors to short range.
Attempt a limited positron scan.

35:05.209 --> 35:09.954
- The distortion is still in effect.
- Better jacket the scanning beam.

35:11.589 --> 35:14.673
The secondary beam
is being distorted as well.

35:15.801 --> 35:20.427
Mr Data, our sensors are rendered
ineffective by the distortion.

35:20.555 --> 35:22.346
I want your analysis.

35:22.474 --> 35:24.181
Mr Worf.

35:25.601 --> 35:29.100
Fire phasers, maximum intensity,
limited spectrum.

35:29.229 --> 35:32.395
001, mark 045.

35:32.524 --> 35:36.058
- An experiment, Captain?
- Exactly, Number One.

35:36.193 --> 35:37.735
Firing phasers.

35:49.121 --> 35:50.912
Explanation, Mr Data?

35:51.039 --> 35:53.874
Phaser energy
was reflected by the wavefronts.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.665
It is similar to the phenomenon
distorting our sensors.

35:58.379 --> 36:01.083
Phasers and sensors both useless?

36:02.382 --> 36:04.707
Mr Data, this reflection phenomenon,

36:04.843 --> 36:07.843
would it have the same effect
on a disruptor?

36:07.970 --> 36:10.342
Yes. Disruptors would be ineffective.

36:10.472 --> 36:14.220
- The ship's cloaking field?
- Difficult to maintain, sir.

36:15.185 --> 36:21.518
Mr Data, is it likely that the Vico
was attacked inside the cluster?

36:21.649 --> 36:26.393
Given these effects, the probability
is exceedingly remote, sir.

36:29.363 --> 36:32.613
- Picard to Counsellor Troi.
- Yes, Captain?

36:32.741 --> 36:35.446
Counsellor, bring Timothy
to my ready room.

36:37.370 --> 36:40.406
Can you tell us
what happened to your ship?

36:40.539 --> 36:41.535
I did tell you!

36:41.665 --> 36:44.037
- Tell us again.
- We were attacked.

36:44.168 --> 36:47.334
That is highly unlikely.
Our investigations...

36:47.462 --> 36:49.953
We were attacked!

36:50.089 --> 36:51.548
Timothy.

36:52.341 --> 36:55.295
Androids do not lie.

37:00.056 --> 37:01.550
It was me.

37:02.391 --> 37:03.969
Please explain.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.393
It was me.

37:09.731 --> 37:11.273
I did it.

37:13.234 --> 37:14.977
I killed them all.

37:25.244 --> 37:27.153
Everything was shaking.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.698
I lost my balance.

37:33.584 --> 37:36.668
I was just trying
to hold on to something.

37:39.172 --> 37:41.129
I didn't mean to do it.

37:43.092 --> 37:45.298
What didn't you mean to do?

37:46.804 --> 37:50.967
My arm hit the computer panel.

37:52.642 --> 37:54.765
That's what destroyed the ship.

37:54.894 --> 37:58.559
The ship was damaged
when your arm hit the computer panel?

38:00.607 --> 38:02.516
Timothy, listen to me.

38:03.026 --> 38:04.603
The damage to your ship

38:04.736 --> 38:09.231
might have occurred at the same time
your arm touched the panel.

38:09.365 --> 38:11.855
But it was only a coincidence.

38:12.826 --> 38:14.617
This wasn't your fault.

38:14.744 --> 38:17.828
- Yes, it was!
- It is not possible.

38:17.955 --> 38:20.825
The on-board control systems
for every starship

38:20.958 --> 38:23.164
require a user-code clearance.

38:23.293 --> 38:26.911
You could not inadvertently affect
the Vico's systems.

38:27.046 --> 38:29.453
Your computer had safety precautions.

38:29.590 --> 38:33.124
There is nothing you touched
that would damage your ship.

38:33.260 --> 38:36.628
You're not responsible
for what happened to your parents.

38:37.847 --> 38:39.756
But if it wasn't me...

38:39.890 --> 38:42.891
We are trying to determine
what happened right now.

38:43.018 --> 38:46.433
If there is anything you can remember
that might assist...

38:48.606 --> 38:53.516
That's just how it was
when it started on the Vico.

39:05.954 --> 39:08.112
Wavefront intensity has increased.

39:08.248 --> 39:11.118
- Increase shields to 75 percent.
- Aye, sir.

39:15.337 --> 39:18.172
- Damage, Worf?
- Minimal. Shields are holding.

39:19.048 --> 39:21.290
Ensign, full about. Go to warp two.

39:23.636 --> 39:26.209
The gravitational distortion
is too high.

39:26.346 --> 39:29.015
We can't maintain a warp field.

39:29.140 --> 39:31.216
- Full shields.
- Aye.

39:33.394 --> 39:36.098
Captain, impulse power
has been disrupted.

39:36.230 --> 39:38.138
The helm won't respond.

39:38.648 --> 39:40.308
We couldn't get out either.

39:40.441 --> 39:43.644
Timothy, perhaps we should go below,
out of the way.

39:43.778 --> 39:45.485
- No!
- La Forge.

39:45.612 --> 39:48.447
- More power to the shields.
- Stand by.

39:48.573 --> 39:51.490
That's what they kept saying.
"More shields."

39:51.618 --> 39:54.737
- "More shields."
- Timothy, accompany me, please.

39:59.291 --> 40:03.751
Recall everything said aboard
the Vico before it was destroyed.

40:03.878 --> 40:06.166
I don't know. Just "more shields".

40:09.216 --> 40:13.427
Captain, I've transferred fusion
reactors into the shield array.

40:13.553 --> 40:15.260
That doubles shield strength.

40:15.388 --> 40:18.886
Wavefront intensity has increased
by an order of magnitude.

40:19.016 --> 40:22.384
Impact in three, two, one.

40:25.021 --> 40:27.262
Wavefront intensity is increasing.

40:27.398 --> 40:30.398
Structural over-pressure
exceeding 180 percent.

40:30.525 --> 40:33.063
- La Forge?
- I don't understand.

40:33.194 --> 40:35.863
We could run it off the warp drive.

40:35.988 --> 40:37.103
Go ahead.

40:37.239 --> 40:41.283
Initiating warp-transfer pathways
now.

40:41.410 --> 40:43.947
Diverting warp power to the shields.

40:44.621 --> 40:48.867
Warp power to the shields.
They said that, too. I'm positive.

40:52.461 --> 40:55.627
Wavefront intensity
has increased by a factor of ten.

40:55.755 --> 40:57.629
Contact in 31 seconds.

40:57.757 --> 41:00.876
Without more power to the shields,
the hull will not hold.

41:01.010 --> 41:04.212
- La Forge!
- Transfer to the shields complete.

41:04.346 --> 41:06.504
That's as strong as they'll get.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.467
Impact in 15 seconds.

41:09.975 --> 41:13.142
- Sir, drop the shields.
- That's suicide, Data!

41:13.854 --> 41:16.344
Captain, drop the shields.

41:22.236 --> 41:24.358
- Make it so!
- Aye.

41:37.290 --> 41:40.493
Our shields caused the increases
in the wavefronts.

41:40.626 --> 41:43.627
We experienced
a harmonic-amplification effect.

41:43.754 --> 41:47.004
The more energy to the shield,
the worse the impact.

41:47.132 --> 41:50.500
Precisely.
That is also what destroyed the Vico.

41:50.635 --> 41:54.086
When Timothy remembered
similar procedures on his ship,

41:54.221 --> 41:57.637
I analysed shield output
to wavefront amplification

41:57.766 --> 41:59.557
and discovered a correlation.

42:01.561 --> 42:06.899
If we had transferred all that power,
it would have torn the ship apart.

42:11.236 --> 42:12.433
Status?

42:13.446 --> 42:16.363
- Navigation is back on line.
- Full about.

42:16.490 --> 42:20.404
One-quarter impulse.
Take us out of here.

42:41.761 --> 42:44.845
Timothy is a boy feeling great pain.

42:44.972 --> 42:47.261
But he is a boy again.

42:51.978 --> 42:54.267
Is this difficult for you, Data?

42:55.189 --> 42:56.648
Difficult?

42:56.774 --> 43:01.269
To watch him moving away
from being like you?

43:01.403 --> 43:05.400
That would require an emotional
context which I cannot provide.

43:05.531 --> 43:08.532
OK, everybody, let's go. Come on.

43:17.750 --> 43:19.209
Hello, Timothy.

43:20.336 --> 43:22.624
Hi, Data. How are you?

43:24.923 --> 43:28.754
I am operating within established
parameters. How are you?

43:30.052 --> 43:31.676
I miss my parents.

43:33.805 --> 43:35.963
But, I'm OK.

43:39.518 --> 43:43.847
I guess you thought I was silly
when I had my hair like yours.

43:45.565 --> 43:49.099
I have been told that imitation
is the highest flattery.

43:53.405 --> 43:57.817
Can we still do things,
even if I'm not really an android?

43:57.951 --> 43:59.943
I have many human friends.

44:00.077 --> 44:02.912
I would be pleased
to count you among them.

44:03.038 --> 44:04.781
That would be...

44:07.000 --> 44:08.375
...acceptable.
