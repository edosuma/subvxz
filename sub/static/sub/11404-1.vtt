By Stevie Wonder)

00:07.874 --> 00:09.398
(buzzer sounds)

00:13.780 --> 00:16.180
(man) Times are changing.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.011
I'm Ed Sullivan. And this is Broadway.

00:19.085 --> 00:22.145
# Baby. Everything is all right

00:22.222 --> 00:26.181
- # Uptight. Out of sight
- (whistle blows)

00:26.259 --> 00:28.227
I have a dream.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.794
# I know I'm just an average guy

00:32.866 --> 00:35.664
- # No football hero or smooth Don Juan

00:35.735 --> 00:37.168
I am the greatest!

00:37.570 --> 00:39.504
# I'm a poor man's son

00:39.572 --> 00:41.597

of their character.

00:41.674 --> 00:48.580
# Everything is all right. Uptight
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah. Baby...

00:48.648 --> 00:51.276
(whistle blows/applause)

00:52.752 --> 00:55.846
(man with Texas twang)
Hey. You guys are playing like girls.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.856
Are you kiddin' me?

00:57.924 --> 01:01.189
Hey, hey, Winnaker,
do you want me to get you a skirt?

01:01.261 --> 01:03.729
I'll get you a skirt
if you keep playing like a girl.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.322
There it is, there it is.
Come on, set it up.

01:06.399 --> 01:09.334
Bring it down, bring it down.
Set it up! Set it up!

01:09.402 --> 01:13.463
There it is. Pop the ball.
Pop it in there, pop it in there.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.974
All right, good. There it is.

01:16.042 --> 01:18.033
(buzzer goes off)

01:18.111 --> 01:22.605
# Ooh-hoo. Ooh-hoo-hoo.
Ooh-hoo. Ooh-hoo-hoo

01:23.183 --> 01:24.912
Congratulations, Coach.

01:24.984 --> 01:26.747
# Ooh-hoo. Ooh-hoo

01:26.820 --> 01:28.913
# Ohh-hoo-hoo

01:28.988 --> 01:30.853
# Ooh-hoo. Ooh-hoo-hoo

01:30.924 --> 01:33.654
# Ooh-hoo. Ooh-hoo-hoo

01:33.726 --> 01:34.420
Unh!

01:34.961 --> 01:37.088
# Ooh-hoo. Ooh-hoo-hoo

01:37.163 --> 01:38.357
# Ooh-hoo. Ooh-hoo

01:38.431 --> 01:42.128
- (coach) That's good. That's perfect.
- (boy) OK. You do that.

01:42.202 --> 01:45.171
(# "Rave On" by Buddy Holly over radio)

# Rave on. This crazy feelin'

01:50.477 --> 01:53.605
Get your arm up. There it is.
That's good, that's perfect.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.046
You go like this.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.981
- (baby babbles)
- Shush.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.042
All right. Here you go.

02:00.253 --> 02:03.711
- (boy) My dad can slam-dunk it.
- (boy #2) Let me do it. Let me do it, Dad!

02:03.790 --> 02:07.226
Great. All right, Mark, that's good.
That's good ball-handling.

02:07.293 --> 02:10.091
Brent, you ready? This is a bounce pass.

02:11.764 --> 02:12.992
Ohh!

02:13.066 --> 02:14.966
(Brent cries)

02:15.034 --> 02:17.832
- It's all right. You'll live.

- It wasn't me. It was Dad.
- Traitor.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.302
I'm not getting in trouble.

02:23.376 --> 02:25.640
Catch it with your hands,
not your arms.

02:25.712 --> 02:28.044
(telephone rings)

02:28.114 --> 02:29.672
Hello.

02:30.683 --> 02:31.775
This is Don.

02:31.851 --> 02:35.981
(man) We know you blew out your knee.
It's tough, giving up a dream, starting over,

02:36.055 --> 02:39.889
but I'm glad to hear you're interested
in a coaching position, Mr. Haskins.

02:39.959 --> 02:42.393
McCarty here says you're a winner.

02:42.462 --> 02:46.330
I sure appreciate that.
Now, my style of coaching is one that...

02:46.399 --> 02:50.165
You played for Mr. Iba, so you know
how to reign in these unruly boys.

02:50.236 --> 02:53.899
Sir, I do believe in discipline.
Now, my basketball philosophy is...

02:53.973 --> 02:58.933
Mr. Haskins. You know, we're a small
school and we can't pay very much.

02:59.012 --> 03:02.971
So we're gonna need you to live
in the men's dorm with your family

03:03.049 --> 03:06.485
and keep those boys in line over there.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.851
But your meals are free at the cafeteria.

03:08.922 --> 03:15.157
And you got plenty of Texas sunshine.
So... how's it sound?

03:18.798 --> 03:22.131
If that's what it takes
to coach Division I basketball, then...

03:22.202 --> 03:24.500
ha-ha-ha, that's all right with me.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.804
It's just a dusty old cow town.

03:27.874 --> 03:31.503
Yeah, but if it's got a court with a roof
and uniforms that match,

03:31.578 --> 03:35.070
then I wanna coach there.
I wanna play against the best.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.844
I just wanted to thank you
for bringing me on.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.509
Us Aggies gotta stick together.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.578
- (Don) You've been here a few weeks.
- Yeah.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.555
What you think?

03:44.624 --> 03:49.823
It ain't much, but we can do something
with it. Here we go. Ready?

03:49.896 --> 03:52.797
This is where you're gonna be living.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.423
Hey, Coach.

03:54.500 --> 03:58.027
Ross Moore, team trainer
and spiritual advisor.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.937
We're gonna need some of that.
This is my wife, Mary.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.305
Hi, Mrs. Haskins. Come on in here.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.503
- Hate to put you out.
- Oh, no.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.773
You ain't putting me out.
Don't think about it.

04:07.847 --> 04:11.112
I'm thinking about leaving
this prize gator here for you.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.880
- Makes a fine ceiling ornament.
- Cool.

04:13.953 --> 04:15.511
You hear that? I made up my mind.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.716
That little boy love that gator.
I'm gonna leave him there.

04:19.291 --> 04:22.089
I've been checking the cupboard.
It's a little bare.

04:22.161 --> 04:25.528
We got Baudoin outta Albuquerque,
20 points a game last year.

04:25.598 --> 04:30.729
Got us a Missouri boy. Fast and tough
on defense - a kid named Armstrong.

04:30.803 --> 04:32.771
(creaking)

04:32.839 --> 04:36.866
David Palacio,
he's the top prep scorer in El Paso.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.036
Waiting on junior-college transfers.

04:39.112 --> 04:43.446
And Jerry in Housing says
on taco night, we get a real good crowd.

04:43.516 --> 04:45.211
Taco night?

04:45.518 --> 04:46.951
Taco night.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.686
What's the budget for recruiting?

04:51.758 --> 04:54.659
Ross says the budget's in the lights.

05:02.502 --> 05:05.596
How can I have a winning team
with no budget for recruiting?

05:05.672 --> 05:09.574
Now, listen, Coach. Football is king here.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.167
And basketball sucks hind tit.

05:12.245 --> 05:16.477
I'll shake down the boosters for a few more
bucks, get a couple more scholarships.

05:16.549 --> 05:17.982
A few more bucks?

05:18.051 --> 05:21.714
I gotta go find players. How can I recruit
with one or two scholarships?

05:21.788 --> 05:26.122
Do you forget where you come from, Don?
Coaching high school girls.

05:26.192 --> 05:30.094
Take a look around you.
This ain't Kansas, Duke, Kentucky.

05:30.163 --> 05:34.361
We're a poor school that counts
every penny to pay for a river rat's dream

05:34.434 --> 05:35.958
of a college education.

05:36.035 --> 05:38.435
We're lucky to put a decent team
on the court.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.029
Well, decent don't cut it with me.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.801
Duke's where you wanna go.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.676
Hey, how you doing?
Don Haskins, Texas Western.

05:48.748 --> 05:50.648
How you doing? Don Haskins.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.621
- See anyone you like?
- What about number three over there?

05:55.688 --> 05:59.021
Jason Stevens out of Chicago.
18 points a game.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.925
Hasn't signed a letter of intent yet.

06:01.994 --> 06:03.791
Jason!

06:03.863 --> 06:05.797
Beating a dead horse there, Don.

06:05.865 --> 06:09.198
- Jason, Don Haskins, Texas Western.
- Western Union?

06:09.268 --> 06:11.463
Texas Western, down in El Paso.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.904
After the game, I'd like to talk to you
about playing for me.

06:14.974 --> 06:20.241
Play for you at Texas Western?
Thanks, Coach, but I'm partial to winning.

06:24.217 --> 06:28.483
How about that big ol' tall boy?
Made All-Jayhawk Conference last year.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.523
Gonna sign with Kansas.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.692

07:00.787 --> 07:03.517
You wanna talk to Bobby Joe Hill?

07:03.589 --> 07:06.387
Son, you can't win playing nigger ball.

07:06.459 --> 07:09.587
Sure, they can jump, but they can't lead.

07:09.662 --> 07:12.426
Can't handle the pressure.
Don't have enough intelligence.

07:12.498 --> 07:15.592
That boy in particular.
No-account smart-mouth.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.260
Just tell me where I can find him.

07:20.406 --> 07:24.536
Excuse me. I'm the basketball coach
down at Texas Western.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.738
- I'd like to talk to you about playing there.
- No, thanks.

07:27.814 --> 07:31.614
I'm done playing this game.
They hardly put me on the floor tonight.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.879
- I'm offering a full scholarship.
- Uh-huh.

07:33.953 --> 07:37.821
You sign me up like your token Negro,
bury me at the end of the bench.

07:37.890 --> 07:40.620
I'd rather hang it up. Do something else.

07:40.693 --> 07:44.424
Be the next Smokey Robinson.
I might even run for president.

07:44.497 --> 07:47.830
You got a real talent, son.
Why throw it away?

07:48.935 --> 07:53.395
I'll tell you why. Ever since I was a kid, I
only loved one thing - that was playing ball.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.931
Do you understand what that's like,
to have that ball in your hand?

07:57.009 --> 07:59.477
It's like making sweet music
with your game.

07:59.545 --> 08:03.174
Only thing is,
you don't wanna hear the song.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.983
You talk a good game, Hill.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.625
I didn't come here to find a player
I could sit on the bench.

08:13.693 --> 08:17.527
I intend to start you -
start NCAA Division One ball.

08:17.597 --> 08:22.034
What is it with you, mister?
I've accepted it. What are you smoking?

08:22.768 --> 08:25.066
I ain't smoking nothing, son.

08:26.205 --> 08:31.973
Now, you just told me about a big old
dream you have. I can let you play.

08:32.044 --> 08:37.311
I can help you make your dream come true
faster than a twister'll take your socks off.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.178
You talk funny.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.487
So do you.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.993
You gonna let a black player play
from the get-go?

08:49.061 --> 08:53.327
I don't see color. I see quick,
I see skill, and that's what you have.

08:53.399 --> 08:56.732
And that's what I'm putting on the court.

09:03.976 --> 09:07.707
So, what is this team, anyway?

09:07.780 --> 09:10.715
All right, that New York recruiter,
Hilton White.

09:10.783 --> 09:14.014
He's got three boys up there now.
They're just playground kids.

09:14.086 --> 09:16.384
He said they could play with anybody.

09:16.455 --> 09:21.017
Every one of these players
you're looking at is colored, Don.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.923
How many are you recruiting?

09:23.996 --> 09:27.454
We need seven players on this team
who can put it in the hole and rebound.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.899
Now, if they're colored, well, fine.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.832
Well, then now, Coach,
let me try to paint you a little picture.

09:34.907 --> 09:38.502
There are no coloreds playing
Division One basketball in the South.

09:38.578 --> 09:43.413
Not in the SEC, not in the ACC
and not in the SWC.

09:43.482 --> 09:45.950
But you go and put seven of 'em
on our team.

09:46.018 --> 09:49.283
Am I losing my hearing?
Do I need a darn hearing aid?

09:49.355 --> 09:52.256
No, Ross. I intend to win.

09:53.192 --> 09:56.787
Shoot. You carrying on like Negroes
gonna be the future of basketball.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.762
Could you imagine that?

09:59.565 --> 10:01.897
There are rules. Unwritten rules.

10:01.968 --> 10:06.428
You play one at home, two on the road
and three if you're losing.

10:06.505 --> 10:09.941
Lord have mercy. Loadin' up
on Negroes, that just ain't done.

10:10.009 --> 10:15.311
You gonna put your career at risk,
my career at risk and Moe's career at risk.

10:15.381 --> 10:19.249
(Moe) If that wasn't bad enough, we ain't
even got enough gas money to get home.

10:19.318 --> 10:21.809
Ain't it lucky you don't got
to worry about that?

10:21.887 --> 10:24.947
'Cause you'll be out on the first bus
to New York tomorrow.

10:25.024 --> 10:29.654
You're sending me there for schoolyard
players? You gotta be out of your mind.

10:29.729 --> 10:32.527
And who's paying for all this,
if you don't mind me asking?

10:32.598 --> 10:36.762
(Haskin) You wanna win. You gotta
recruit. That's how the big boys do it.

10:45.678 --> 10:47.111
It was a good game, man.

10:47.179 --> 10:49.204
Hey, kid, you got a minute?

10:49.281 --> 10:52.250
Mama baked a pie. One piece left,
it's got my name all over it.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.219
Hey, kid, you got a minute?

10:56.989 --> 10:59.822
- You know that guy?
- What? No.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.292
Kid, you got a minute?

11:02.361 --> 11:04.420
Run. Run!

11:08.768 --> 11:10.759
Hey, Charlie!

11:15.007 --> 11:18.909
Hey, Mama. You're not gonna believe
what just happened to me and Alvin.

11:18.978 --> 11:22.038
Almost got jumped
by a couple of crackers.

11:22.114 --> 11:24.446
I'm just dying for a piece of that...

11:24.517 --> 11:27.247
...pie.
- Ma'am, this pie is so good,

11:27.319 --> 11:29.583
it makes me mad at my mama.

11:29.655 --> 11:33.056
This is Mr. Haskins.
He come all the way from El Paso, Texas.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.457
He want you to play basketball
on a scholarship.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.520
Texas? To get lynched?

11:38.597 --> 11:43.830
Now, El Paso's not like the rest of Texas.
It's, um... It's more cosmopolitan.

11:43.903 --> 11:46.269
Pops already got me a good job
at the factory...

11:46.338 --> 11:49.535
- I always wanted an education for Harry.
- They got schools here.

11:49.608 --> 11:53.442
I don't feel comfortable
sending my boy that far away

11:53.512 --> 11:55.980
and trusting him to a stranger.

11:56.048 --> 12:01.418
I know. I understand. I will look
after him like he's one of my own.

12:01.487 --> 12:05.719
- You ate my pie.
- We're church people around here.

12:05.791 --> 12:08.089
Are you?

12:12.364 --> 12:14.628
I won't lie.
I hadn't been to church in so long,

12:14.700 --> 12:18.192
I can't remember
which day of the week it falls on.

12:18.270 --> 12:21.535
I'm ashamed to say I'm... I'm just a wretch.

12:23.776 --> 12:24.765
Well...

12:24.844 --> 12:29.110
We all fall short.
And we're saved by grace.

12:29.181 --> 12:32.810
- Tell me more about El Paso.
- No, Mama. Mama, come on, now.

12:32.885 --> 12:38.221
It's lovely, ma'am. It's right on the banks
of the Rio Grande. It's a little oasis.

12:41.227 --> 12:42.819
Nah.

12:42.895 --> 12:44.522
- I got plenty of offers.
- Yeah?

12:44.597 --> 12:48.727
From who? Duke? Kansas?

12:50.436 --> 12:53.928
- I'm playing for the Globetrotters.
- It's probably for the best.

12:54.006 --> 12:58.807
You're better off with the Trotters
playing its team of patsies every night.

12:58.878 --> 13:04.441
You can't get past an average defender in
our league with that fancy dribble of yours.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.384
Man, no offense, but that's bull.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.978
Hey, brother, no offense,
but without work,

13:10.055 --> 13:12.922
I don't think you'd get past
a beat-up old-timer like me.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.459
(laughter)

13:14.527 --> 13:16.722
Get past you?

13:18.097 --> 13:22.431
I would go past you, through you,
over you, under you, around you.

13:22.501 --> 13:25.231
As a matter of fact,
I'll spin you like a top,

13:25.304 --> 13:28.933
eat your lunch, steal your girl
and kick your dog at the same time.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.066
(scoffs)

13:30.142 --> 13:31.336
Get past you.

13:31.410 --> 13:35.744
- Come on, Orsten!
- Hey, come on.

13:35.815 --> 13:36.839
(girl) Do your thang.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.816
- You fouling me.
- You call that a foul?

13:38.884 --> 13:41.819
My three year old calls that a love tap.

13:44.056 --> 13:45.887
(girl) Ooh! Come on, man.

13:45.958 --> 13:48.654
Hey, hold it, hold it.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.924
You expect me to react to all
that head-shake and body gyration?

13:51.997 --> 13:54.488
It's activity without accomplishment.

13:54.567 --> 13:58.230
You got the ball in front of you.
You ain't going anywhere without it.

13:58.304 --> 14:02.070
Try this. It's called a rocker step.
You ready? Get in your stance.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.268
OK?

14:04.343 --> 14:07.141
The difference between me and you
is I got the ball protected.

14:07.213 --> 14:10.512
It looks like I'm starting to dribble,
so you react, and when you do,

14:10.583 --> 14:13.347
cross over, dribble right by you.

14:14.119 --> 14:19.785
Try it. It's simple, but it'll make
that pretty little shot of yours work.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.019
(cheering)

14:25.097 --> 14:27.156
First time. There it is.

14:29.668 --> 14:31.397
Excuse me!

14:31.470 --> 14:33.563
I'm looking for three guys. Uh...

14:33.639 --> 14:36.665
Names of Nevil Shed,

14:36.742 --> 14:40.337
Willie Worsley and Willie Cager.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.846
They're colored boys.
You know them?

14:42.915 --> 14:45.383
- Did he say "colored"?
- He said what I think he did.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.611
Yeah.

14:46.685 --> 14:51.315
And I don't think he was talking
about no television set, neither.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.085
He got a nice car.

14:53.158 --> 14:56.525
These New York kids may be
from the street, but they sure can play.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.358
Little guard plays like a giant.

14:58.430 --> 15:01.126
Forward runs like an antelope.
Never seen anything like him.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.964
- How long till you can have 'em out?
- A week maybe.

15:04.036 --> 15:06.834
How's it with Lattin?
These boys play big, but they ain't big.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.271
Hey!

15:08.340 --> 15:10.934
You want me to fill this thing up?

15:11.010 --> 15:13.171
I called his coach, but he run me off.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.713
I still got one more roll of these dice,
though.

15:15.781 --> 15:17.772
And one more little thing, Don.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.943
I had a little misunderstanding here.

15:20.019 --> 15:22.749
Do you think you could wire me
another hundred dollars?

15:37.536 --> 15:40.164
Where on earth's this coach taking us?

15:40.239 --> 15:43.902
I don't think we're even
on earth anymore, brah.

15:43.976 --> 15:45.773
- Say, Willie.
- Yeah.

15:45.844 --> 15:47.744
- You got a dime?
- For what?

15:48.480 --> 15:52.416
I gotta call my mama.
Tell her I'm an astronaut.

15:52.484 --> 15:54.884

on the moon.

15:56.755 --> 15:59.053
What's this dead stuff
on the side of the road?

15:59.124 --> 16:02.218
Players from last year's team
trying to crawl back to New York.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.455
We driving into hell, plain and simple.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.966
El Paso, Texas! Ain't no place like it.

16:08.400 --> 16:12.734
Big ol' west Texas sun shining down
about 330 days a year.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.830
Yes, sir, you're in God's country now.

16:14.907 --> 16:19.241
If this is God's country, obviously
the good Lord don't want no neighbors.

16:23.382 --> 16:26.249
Say, man,
this place looks like Bonanza.

16:26.318 --> 16:29.845
Hey, look, just smile at 'em
and say "howdy."

16:29.922 --> 16:31.116
Howdy.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.754
To him you gotta say "hole-ah."
Like this, see.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.263
Hole-ah!

16:39.331 --> 16:43.427
- Man, what this "hole-ah" mean?
- It means, "Hello, Puerto Ricans."

16:43.502 --> 16:46.300
You've signed some black players, Don?

16:46.372 --> 16:47.600
That's right.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.107
Seven of them?

16:50.175 --> 16:51.164
(chuckles)

16:51.243 --> 16:55.839
I'm not sure that all the boosters
are gonna like it. All right?

16:55.914 --> 16:59.179
It's a little different
than what they're used to.

16:59.251 --> 17:02.084
You hired me to put a team together -
that's what I'm doing.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.714
No, Don.

17:04.790 --> 17:08.089
I hired you to ride herd
on the athletic dorm.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.391
I've got a little more
than I bargained for.

17:13.398 --> 17:15.230
Those our new teammates?

17:15.300 --> 17:17.733
(man) Ross said things
were gonna be different.

17:17.803 --> 17:20.795
Doesn't look like he was kidding.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.400
- I ain't never seen one of them before.
- One what?

17:24.476 --> 17:26.773
One of them - a colored.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.745
You've gotta get off the farm more.

17:28.814 --> 17:32.545
I'll have some of that and some of this
and some of that.

17:32.618 --> 17:35.416
- Save a brother some scraps.
- Back off, midget.

17:35.487 --> 17:37.978
Who you calling midget?
You big-toothed clown.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.890
Grab your red hat and lantern
and get back on the front lawn.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.984
I'll let you know
when the full-sized men are done eating.

17:43.062 --> 17:47.795
Easy, choppers. I seen Pontiacs with
smaller grilles than those teeth of yours.

17:47.866 --> 17:51.927
- Taco, nacho, burrito?
- No. I'm looking for hot dog-o.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.996
Taco, nacho, burrito?

17:55.074 --> 17:57.668
No, no. Hot dog-o.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.438
Hot dog-o.

17:59.511 --> 18:01.342

18:14.993 --> 18:19.930
What are you lookin' at?
Ain't you never seen a black man before?

18:22.067 --> 18:25.230
Yeah, I've seen plenty of folks like you.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.198
So, are you from Harlem?

18:29.274 --> 18:32.732
- You think all blacks are from Harlem?
- Are all of you from Mayberry?

18:32.811 --> 18:36.372
- Take it easy. He didn't mean nothin'.
- Mind your business, man.

What is he talking about,

22:11.496 --> 22:16.593
You're here to learn fundamental,
disciplined defensive basketball.

22:16.668 --> 22:20.900
Now, that means discipline
both on and off the court.

22:20.972 --> 22:22.963
No girls.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.532
No booze. No late nights.

my butt out there for him anymore.

Why do you need to know my name?
You ain't gonna be usin' it.

My friends call me Bobby Joe.

27:33.918 --> 27:37.445

And I go to the same school you do.

27:37.522 --> 27:41.515
And I'm not about to fall

- Your mama don't even know me.

She said watch out for pretty boys

- I'm just wondering.

28:39.751 --> 28:45.348
You looking a little tired. All that fancy
footwork of yours tire you out yesterday?

28:45.423 --> 28:47.914
Or was it something else?

28:48.860 --> 28:52.227
Now, because some of you were bitten
by the evil worm last night,

28:52.297 --> 28:55.357
this morning, all of you are gonna run.

28:55.433 --> 28:59.096

- Hundred lines! Let's do it! Let's sprint!

Are you kiddin' me? Are you kiddin' me?

Hill, get your butt down.

29:15.820 --> 29:21.019
There's 31 days before the season starts,
and you're gonna run every one of 'em.

Oh, that was pretty.
Hey, that was real pretty.

29:24.295 --> 29:28.254
Everybody see that behind-the-back?
The circus has come to town.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.733
- What are you doing?
- I'm just playing my game.

29:30.802 --> 29:34.704
We're playing my game here.
All that other stuff's just insecurity.

29:34.773 --> 29:42.475
Great players make simple, basic,
easy plays. Showboating's just insecurity.

29:43.314 --> 29:46.306
He didn't want us playing our game?
Why'd he bring us here?

29:46.384 --> 29:50.047

- I don't need this, man!

29:50.121 --> 29:53.249
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Yes, you do.

This ain't basketball. You killing us!

you don't got much to bargain with.

30:07.705 --> 30:09.605
What?

30:10.642 --> 30:12.667
You wanna quit?

30:13.945 --> 30:16.243
You wanna quit?

30:16.314 --> 30:20.944
You quit right now,
you'll quit every day the rest of your life.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.185
Watch.

30:55.520 --> 31:00.150
Don't worry.
Gunsmoke wasn't that good tonight.

31:00.225 --> 31:02.284
How was the practice?

31:04.929 --> 31:07.227
That good, huh?

31:07.832 --> 31:11.825
Come on! Move those feet!
Move the ball, faster! Faster!

Knock it off! Knock it off!
Knock it off! Knock it off!

31:25.884 --> 31:29.342
You'd done that in a game,
it'd be a technical foul for fighting.

31:29.420 --> 31:32.514
Both of you'd be ejected.
Probably cost us the game, son.

31:32.590 --> 31:36.287
Baseline, everybody. Y'all gonna run
'cause of their selfishness.

31:36.361 --> 31:38.886
Two weeks before the game,
and you still don't listen.

all the minerals in your boxes.

31:43.301 --> 31:48.705
I'll be passing around to your stations,
so if you have any problems, let me know.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.646
This team does not play playground ball.

32:00.718 --> 32:04.916

defensive basketball.

how to make a shot.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.629
There you go.

32:17.101 --> 32:19.194
- You want me to do that?
- Mm-hm.

32:19.270 --> 32:23.036
Come on, Coach. What about my stylin'?
I got way too much style to do that.

32:23.107 --> 32:28.477
You leave the styling for the barber shop.
Just show me you belong in the NCAA.

But these grades ain't pulling the truck
up the hill.

32:50.902 --> 32:54.929
It's just that every class is about rocks,
and I'm a black man. I don't do rocks.

32:55.006 --> 32:56.337
Mm-hm.

32:56.407 --> 33:00.571

33:46.991 --> 33:49.289
Can anybody tell me
how they are formed?

33:49.360 --> 33:52.329
Yes, ma'am. Harry can.

33:54.665 --> 33:57.532
- By slow cooling plutons?
- And what is a pluton?

33:57.602 --> 33:59.297
Harry.

34:00.238 --> 34:04.868
It is a deep-seated igneous intrusion
with no visible floor.

40:50.047 --> 40:54.882

At forward, from Eagleville, Missouri,

41:22.980 --> 41:24.914

41:25.616 --> 41:29.643
Three of 'em, Wallace. They look like
the damn Tuskegee Institute out there.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.655
Just when did we become
a colored school?

41:32.723 --> 41:34.987

41:35.059 --> 41:38.460
(sparse applause/whistle blows)

41:38.529 --> 41:40.690
The Miners win the tip-off
to start the season.

41:40.764 --> 41:43.699
- Go, Hill. Set it up. Take your time.
- Set it up!

41:48.372 --> 41:50.363
Hey, protect the ball.

41:51.041 --> 41:53.100
(Milton) Not a good start for the Miners.

41:53.177 --> 41:56.772

just scored on you?

41:56.847 --> 41:58.610
Mitch, over here, over here!

41:58.682 --> 42:01.879
- Hill spins to the basket. Puts it up for two!
- Stop showboating!

42:01.952 --> 42:05.786
Fundamental basketball, Hill.
Watch your base.

42:05.856 --> 42:08.689
You didn't have a base -
that's how he went around you.

42:08.759 --> 42:14.220
Coach Haskins trying to mold these guys
into team players... Cager for two.

42:14.298 --> 42:16.960
Cager, just lay the ball off the board.

42:20.037 --> 42:23.495
Get your hand in his face, son!
You gotta challenge that shot.

42:23.574 --> 42:26.042
Right here, over here. Shoot it.

42:26.110 --> 42:28.704

42:29.914 --> 42:32.144
Hill wheelin' and dealin'.
The ball's loose!

42:32.216 --> 42:35.014
- That's why I don't want you showboating.
- Let's go!

42:35.085 --> 42:38.020
Hey, Armstrong. Hey, Flournoy.
Are you kiddin' me?

42:38.088 --> 42:41.319
Lattin, you're ankle-deep in the floor, son.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.860

42:47.898 --> 42:49.092
Hey, I saw it, son.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.396
And the Miners lead by four.

42:52.169 --> 42:53.727
They need one stop now.

42:53.804 --> 42:56.671
Good defense, Armstrong!
Good defense!

42:56.740 --> 43:01.074
So the Don Haskins era begins
in victory. A four-point win

43:01.145 --> 43:04.205
over a less-than-impressive squad
from Eastern New Mexico.

43:04.281 --> 43:06.010
But the real story tonight -

43:06.083 --> 43:10.042
Coach Haskins putting three Negro
players into the starting lineup -

43:10.120 --> 43:14.420
a move that's sure to stir things up
both on and off the court this season.

I just wanna stay in one place for a while.

You got what it takes, Bobby Joe?

44:21.625 --> 44:22.614
(coughs)

44:23.794 --> 44:27.025
- Hey, Coach, I can't go no more!
- I think you can go some more.

44:27.097 --> 44:30.794
You got energy for all kind of nonsense
instead of putting it in your team!

44:30.868 --> 44:33.996
Instead of demonstrating some respect
and being a leader!

44:34.071 --> 44:36.062
I ain't got no team!

44:36.140 --> 44:39.439
We ain't going nowhere! You telling us
all the time how bad we are!

44:39.510 --> 44:43.606
We know we ain't gonna win!
What do I got to respect?

44:51.689 --> 44:55.455
My old man drove a truck
for the better half of his life.

44:55.526 --> 44:59.860
Now, there ain't nothing wrong with that...
other than the fact he hated it.

44:59.930 --> 45:02.524
That's the only way he knew
how to put food on the table

45:02.599 --> 45:06.933
and give his kids a chance
to do something they loved.

45:07.004 --> 45:10.701
I love this game. I love this game.

45:11.675 --> 45:13.870
I never was the greatest player.

45:13.944 --> 45:18.347
But I busted my butt,
and I outworked better players.

45:18.415 --> 45:22.909
I ain't the smartest coach, but I bust
my butt and I outwork smarter coaches.

45:22.986 --> 45:28.947
And when I see the talent you got
and I see you wasting it, ticks me off.

45:29.026 --> 45:34.328
Now, if you couldn't get in the gym,
if you didn't have the opportunity,

45:34.398 --> 45:36.662
there'd be nothing for us to talk about,

45:36.734 --> 45:40.830

Times are different. You're in the gym.

45:40.904 --> 45:45.341
And if you're in the gym, you step out on
that floor, you better respect my father, me,

45:45.409 --> 45:49.812
and you better respect yourself
and play some basketball.

45:52.449 --> 45:55.009
Midway through the first half.
Iowa playing well.

45:55.085 --> 46:00.387
Of course. That's to be expected. They're
undefeated. Number four in the country.

46:02.893 --> 46:07.353
Iowa. Always a contender in the Big Ten.
And there's a bucket for the Hawkeyes.

46:07.431 --> 46:11.629
Coach Haskins is not happy.
It's an eight-point game right now.

46:12.936 --> 46:15.234
Hey! Tighten up out there!

46:17.641 --> 46:19.404

- Shed, would you box out?

46:29.386 --> 46:32.446
That's it! We got 'em now.

46:32.523 --> 46:36.619
Texas Western struggling to score
against this tough Hawkeyes' defense.

46:36.693 --> 46:39.025
And there's a great block
just before the half.

46:39.096 --> 46:40.154
(buzzer signals end of half)

46:40.230 --> 46:44.894
I've seen a lot of rough halves in
basketball. But the Miners are struggling.

46:44.968 --> 46:48.836
They'll go to the locker room
down by 16 points.

46:49.706 --> 46:53.335
Say it, Hill.
Come on, Hill, say it.

46:53.410 --> 46:58.109
We can't play like this!
They're better than us at your game.

46:58.182 --> 47:00.650
You need to let us loose!

47:00.717 --> 47:03.481
Just stick to the plan, Bobby Joe.

47:03.554 --> 47:06.717
You want fundamental basketball, right?

47:08.725 --> 47:10.124

47:10.194 --> 47:14.858
Iowa is just flat outplaying Texas
Western. It's been a difficult game so far.

47:14.932 --> 47:17.696
Ain't our night, Coach.

47:17.768 --> 47:20.566
Hey, Hill. Time-out.
Time, time, time!

47:20.637 --> 47:22.537
Time-out, white.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.506
Coach...

47:28.345 --> 47:31.143

47:36.587 --> 47:40.887
All right, Hill, you play your game.
And you play my game.

47:42.759 --> 47:45.489
- You ready to play?
- Yeah, let's do it.

47:53.971 --> 47:57.463
And the Miners have a couple of baskets
back to back.

47:57.541 --> 47:59.532
Still. Though. A huge deficit.

48:02.980 --> 48:08.145
Orsten Artis with a steal. Bounce pass to
Bobby Joe Hill. He drives it in for two!

48:08.218 --> 48:12.587
Well. The Miners have really turned it up
a notch defensively.

48:15.993 --> 48:18.757
Now it looks like Iowa is the team
that's struggling.

48:18.829 --> 48:22.196
This full-court pressure by the Miners
has the Hawkeyes rattled.

48:22.266 --> 48:24.530
Go to the basket! Go!

48:30.474 --> 48:32.032
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

48:34.645 --> 48:37.045
Whoo! Whoo!

48:42.319 --> 48:46.415

Down 16 at the half. Texas Western
has clawed their way back into this game!

49:24.194 --> 49:29.757

in the game. They have a shot to win this.

55:07.337 --> 55:09.532
Well, we're undefeated.

55:13.743 --> 55:15.734
Whoo, man.

55:15.812 --> 55:18.144
- It's blazin' out there.
- I'm starving.

55:18.214 --> 55:20.739
(# "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"
over radio)

55:24.854 --> 55:28.551
Hey, man. I gotta hit the john.
Order me some huevos rancheros.

55:28.625 --> 55:32.288
Man, will you save that for El Paso?
I'm ordering us some pancakes.

55:32.362 --> 55:35.092
Whatever you get, get me something
with salsa on it, OK?

55:35.165 --> 55:37.998
- I already know what I'm gonna order.
- Hey, y'all, pass the menus.

55:39.369 --> 55:44.329
Hey. Great game last night.
Never seen anybody play like that.

55:45.108 --> 55:46.302
Oh, good morning.

55:46.376 --> 55:50.005
I need eggs. I need some sausage.
Sausage.

55:50.080 --> 55:51.377
Unh!

55:52.349 --> 55:55.443
- It must be a New York thing.
- That's cool.

55:55.518 --> 55:57.042
Unh!

55:57.120 --> 55:58.951
Are you guys ordering pancakes?

55:59.022 --> 56:01.957
Don't get your black stink on me, boy.

56:02.592 --> 56:05.288
# Deck the halls with boughs of holly

56:05.362 --> 56:07.887
# Fa la la la la la la la la

56:07.964 --> 56:11.058
- Hold on!
- Give it a good scrub, huh?

56:11.134 --> 56:14.467
Have a merry Christmas, though.
And have a good day. All right?

56:21.644 --> 56:25.273
Hey, man, you see them eggs up there?
Man, them a little plastic.

56:25.348 --> 56:28.647
- I don't know, man.
- Man, you can't see it.

56:38.228 --> 56:40.128
Shed!

56:40.196 --> 56:43.359
Shed, what happened?
Something's wrong.

56:43.433 --> 56:46.561
What happened, son?
Shed, what happened?

56:48.405 --> 56:51.238
- (Ross) Help me out here.
- What's going on? You all right?

56:51.307 --> 56:52.774
- Help him.
- Who did this?

57:04.187 --> 57:06.121
Anybody see 'em?

57:06.189 --> 57:10.489
Son, get on this bus. Let's go.
Look at me. Look at me. Get on the bus.

57:11.261 --> 57:12.592
- Baudoin.
- Who did this?

57:12.662 --> 57:15.995
- We ain't going nowhere!
- Get on the bus! Everyone get on there!

57:16.065 --> 57:18.465
- (Don) That everyone?
- Move.

57:21.671 --> 57:25.937
- I could kill a honky tonight.
- Ain't nobody killing nobody.

57:26.009 --> 57:27.704
I'm gonna start carrying a knife.

57:27.777 --> 57:30.143
You show a blade,
they gonna pull a shotgun.

57:30.213 --> 57:32.579
What are we supposed to do?
Just take it?

57:32.649 --> 57:36.176
Look, we can't all live the Dr. King rule.
What you want us to do?

57:36.252 --> 57:40.018
- Get slapped, turn the other cheek?
- Hell, no. I'm saying we think.

57:40.089 --> 57:43.252
When we go to the South,
we gotta go in twos.

57:43.326 --> 57:49.231
We're always on the lookout for each other.
Don't turn your back on them crackers.

57:50.900 --> 57:55.303
Shed, you ain't gotta be embarrassed.
Could have happened to any one of us.

57:55.371 --> 58:00.308
I tell you right now, they won't catch us
alone no more. I promise you that.

58:00.376 --> 58:03.607
They come after one of us,
they gonna have to fight all of us.

58:18.528 --> 58:20.120
Mary?

58:20.196 --> 58:25.190
You're really late, Don.
Don't come home late without calling.

58:25.268 --> 58:27.862
You know, things happen to people...

58:27.937 --> 58:31.168
- Lemme get your plate and I'll heat it up.
- Honey, what is it?

58:31.241 --> 58:35.200
- Lemme get it. It'll only take a minute.
- Mary, just talk to me. What is it?

58:35.278 --> 58:37.769
Hey, what is this?

58:37.847 --> 58:40.042
Honey, what is this?

58:51.160 --> 58:54.288
- This the first?
- No, I...

58:54.364 --> 58:56.958
I throw them away
as soon as I get them.

58:57.033 --> 59:01.493
- Why didn't you say something to me?
- I don't know. I just...

59:05.008 --> 59:11.072
My family's most important. How can I
protect you if I don't know what's going on?

59:11.981 --> 59:13.505
Don.

59:13.583 --> 59:17.713
Basketball's been our whole life.
But it's just a game.

59:19.522 --> 59:22.082
I don't know if it's worth this.

59:27.697 --> 59:29.995
No, neither do I.

59:32.435 --> 59:37.566
This is more than just a game now.
And I sure as hell can't quit on it.

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:13.000
(Bobby Joe) Nothing ever
bothered me before.

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:16.807
It's like things,
they rolled right off my back.

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:19.245
I just didn't care.

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:24.820
Now I care.
That scares the heck outta me.

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:28.015
I don't wanna want something
I can lose.

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.793
Baby.

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:34.887
There's nothing you can't lose.

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:40.425
But no one can ever take your desire
away from you. No one.

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:42.095
Ever.

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:48.706
You know, Scoops, man, sometimes I don't
even feel like going back out there again.

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:52.578
Look. You can't let them take basketball
away from you, man.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.776
You can't let them win.

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:59.584
I just don't know how much more of this
I can handle, man. I ain't like you, all brave.

01:00:59.613 --> 01:01:03.947
Sweet Pea, as long as I known you,
you been stronger than you think.

01:01:09.556 --> 01:01:11.820
Hey, you OK, Scoops?

01:01:11.891 --> 01:01:13.688
Yeah, I'm fine, man.

01:01:15.762 --> 01:01:19.163
Hey, man. Hey, tell me
what's goin' on, man. You OK?

01:01:19.232 --> 01:01:22.429
- (teacher) Be ready, please. Thank you.
- (bell rings)

01:01:34.781 --> 01:01:36.772
Scoops, you got a minute?

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:41.753
Says you got something called
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

01:01:41.821 --> 01:01:44.221
My heart's too big.

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:46.417
Ain't that something?

01:01:47.761 --> 01:01:50.628
How long you known, Scoops?

01:01:50.697 --> 01:01:53.564
Well, I...

01:01:53.633 --> 01:01:57.626
I started fainting
when I was in high school, Coach.

01:01:57.704 --> 01:02:00.195
So my mom being who she is,
she took me to the doctor.

01:02:00.273 --> 01:02:03.208
They ran a few tests. That's how
I found out. But it doesn't matter.

01:02:03.276 --> 01:02:06.643
You're a fool. You're a dang fool.
You could have died out there.

01:02:06.713 --> 01:02:09.113
Coach, I'll die if I don't play.

01:02:10.316 --> 01:02:14.685
Look, Coach. My whole life
I only loved playing basketball.

01:02:14.754 --> 01:02:18.087
That's it. But you see,
I could never play in high school,

01:02:18.158 --> 01:02:22.185
because I had to work
to support my mom and my sisters.

01:02:24.364 --> 01:02:30.166
But I never stopped playing in the street.
Never. 'Cause to not play, Coach, man...

01:02:30.236 --> 01:02:34.730
Man. That was like letting something
just crawl up and die in me.

01:02:34.808 --> 01:02:37.368
Far as this heart thing goes,
I can still play.

01:02:37.444 --> 01:02:41.676
My heart's good. This heart thing
ain't nothing. I lived with it this long.

01:02:41.748 --> 01:02:44.080
- That's why you gotta play me.
- I can't do it.

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:45.879
- The doctor said I could.
- I can't.

01:02:45.952 --> 01:02:49.353
He said I could play a few minutes here
and there. Why you won't let me?

01:02:49.422 --> 01:02:52.016
I know what the doctor said, Willie.

01:02:52.092 --> 01:02:56.893
But I can't take a chance with your life.
I can't do that.

01:02:56.963 --> 01:02:59.523
Now, you're still on the team.

01:03:00.133 --> 01:03:02.328
We're gonna need you, Cager.

01:03:02.402 --> 01:03:04.836
We're gonna need your courage.

01:03:05.672 --> 01:03:07.537
(Don chuckles)

01:03:08.475 --> 01:03:11.603
We're gonna need that big heart of yours,
all right?

- You got basketball on your mind, Hill?
- Yeah, Coach. Nothing but.

01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:10.894
Coach Haskins. Matt Pavelar,
Dallas Morning News.

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:12.665
You're playing a lot of coloreds.

01:04:12.739 --> 01:04:16.800
Are you concerned as to whether
the Negro player can handle the pressure

01:04:16.876 --> 01:04:19.777
at the national level?

01:04:19.846 --> 01:04:22.280
My team plays defense, rebounds.

01:04:22.348 --> 01:04:26.580
- (Matt) What statement are you making?
- I'm a coach. I don't make statements.

01:04:26.653 --> 01:04:30.089
- (man) Kentucky's here.
- Thank you, Coach.

01:04:30.857 --> 01:04:32.518
Coach Rupp. Coach Rupp.

01:04:32.592 --> 01:04:34.583
Coach Rupp. Coach Rupp!

01:04:34.661 --> 01:04:36.151
(overlapping chatter)

01:04:36.229 --> 01:04:40.859
Coach Rupp, great game. Take us to the
last 20 seconds. What'd you tell the boys?

01:04:40.934 --> 01:04:43.425
(Rupp) I knew it was 20 seconds.
I gave them a good play.

01:04:43.503 --> 01:04:48.702
Something in our playbook we used for
years. The boys performed it to perfection.

01:04:48.775 --> 01:04:50.538
I'm gonna introduce myself.

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:52.976
...and I know you're gonna let me go.

01:04:53.046 --> 01:04:54.809
- Figures.
- Thank you, Coach.

01:04:55.415 --> 01:04:57.713
- Coach.
- No more interviews. Thank you.

01:04:57.784 --> 01:05:01.447
Don Haskins.
I'm the coach over at Texas Western.

01:05:03.089 --> 01:05:05.148
Just wanted to introduce myself.

01:05:05.225 --> 01:05:08.661
Congratulate you
on another great year and...

01:05:08.728 --> 01:05:11.322
- These your boys?
- Yes, sir.

01:05:11.397 --> 01:05:13.695
Yes, sir, my players.

01:05:15.802 --> 01:05:19.704
Well, you had a fine season.
See you down the road.

01:05:26.613 --> 01:05:28.376
(booing)

01:05:28.448 --> 01:05:32.544
- (man) Losers!
- (man #2) We don't want your kind!

01:05:32.619 --> 01:05:35.782
Ignore all this trash!
Just get out on the court.

01:05:35.855 --> 01:05:37.880
(heckler) Don't you come in here!

01:05:37.957 --> 01:05:40.949
(heckler #2) Look at all
these stupid kids!

01:05:42.695 --> 01:05:45.186
Let go of me, boy!

01:05:45.265 --> 01:05:48.200
(Armstrong) Don't listen to 'em.
Come on, focus.

01:05:48.268 --> 01:05:51.533
- That's easy for you say.
- Don't listen to 'em.

01:05:52.472 --> 01:05:56.169
In spite of a hostile crowd.
The Miners have played well tonight

01:05:56.242 --> 01:05:58.107
as they look to close out East Texas.

01:05:58.177 --> 01:06:02.511
And there's a block. And a fast break
opportunity for the Lions.

01:06:02.582 --> 01:06:05.016
And Jason Stevens puts it up for two.

01:06:05.084 --> 01:06:09.487
Could have been in a Miners' uniform
if Coach had been able to recruit him.

01:06:09.555 --> 01:06:12.683
I see Coach must be clearing the bench,
huh?

01:06:13.393 --> 01:06:18.456
And Stevens. With the hot hand here in the
second half. Being guarded by Baudoin.

01:06:23.269 --> 01:06:24.964
Coach sends his best.

01:06:25.038 --> 01:06:30.408
This has been a hard-fought game
on both sides. Miners lead by five.

01:06:30.476 --> 01:06:33.343
Takes it in to Big Daddy.
Who's pushed to the floor!

01:06:33.413 --> 01:06:35.313
- Are you kiddin' me?
- It is getting rough.

01:06:35.381 --> 01:06:39.147
Let's see who the foul's on.
They call it on Lattin! I can't believe this!

01:06:39.218 --> 01:06:41.345
Lattin's gotta watch his temper here.

01:06:41.421 --> 01:06:44.788
He's already fouled
out of ten games this year.

01:06:44.857 --> 01:06:47.189
(referee) Technical foul.

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.423
Just sit down. You never let your anger
get the better of you.

01:06:50.496 --> 01:06:51.963
- He stuck his knee out!
- I know.

01:06:52.031 --> 01:06:56.559
- Lattin's temper is gonna cost the Miners.
- You gotta hold yourself together.

01:06:56.636 --> 01:06:59.867
- He's sticking his knee out!
- You hold yourself together.

01:06:59.939 --> 01:07:04.433
Keep that anger inside you and I'll let you
know when you can let it go, understand?

01:07:06.212 --> 01:07:09.045
At the beginning of the season.
No one could have imagined

01:07:09.115 --> 01:07:11.310
that we would wind up
where we are now:

01:07:11.384 --> 01:07:13.682
Number four in the nation.

01:07:13.753 --> 01:07:17.416
Close on the heels of powerhouses
like Kentucky and Kansas.

01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:20.857
Now. With two weeks to go
before the NCAA tournament starts.

01:07:20.927 --> 01:07:23.020
We're not a secret anymore.

01:07:28.101 --> 01:07:30.934
(chatter)

01:07:31.004 --> 01:07:32.995
Been this cold before.

01:07:41.714 --> 01:07:43.682
Man!

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:45.877
Ross, Coach, hurry!

01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:01.525
- (Ross) Oh, man.
- (Don) Moe, get us checked out.

01:08:03.269 --> 01:08:07.171
Listen, we're gonna get on the bus
and go to Seattle tonight, all right?

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.334
Get your stuff, pack up
and let's get on the bus.

01:08:15.481 --> 01:08:17.415
Hey, man.

01:08:17.483 --> 01:08:19.781
You ever get scared?

01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:27.024
When I was a kid in Houston...

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:33.421
a white gang strung me on a fire escape
till I peed my pants.

01:08:35.401 --> 01:08:37.698
I came back down and...

01:08:39.238 --> 01:08:41.934
took nothing from nobody ever again.

01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:47.546
Took it to every honky on the block...

01:08:47.613 --> 01:08:51.014
till they left Big Daddy D alone.

01:08:54.554 --> 01:08:58.046
But this is different.

01:09:00.158 --> 01:09:02.059
This is worse.

01:09:06.499 --> 01:09:08.933
This is the whole world.

01:09:09.836 --> 01:09:15.240
- Everything all right, Coach?
- Oh, what'd I get these guys into, Ross?

01:09:18.478 --> 01:09:21.379
You did the right thing.

01:09:21.447 --> 01:09:25.941
You think about what these boys had
to overcome just to get here.

01:09:26.018 --> 01:09:32.354
You think about how they've been
degraded and humiliated,

01:09:32.425 --> 01:09:36.622
just 'cause they black,
by all these "civilized" folks.

01:09:38.363 --> 01:09:41.457
- Shame on us.
- (thunder rumbles)

01:09:42.535 --> 01:09:46.995
WTSM. 1380 broadcasting live
from Seattle. Washington.

01:09:47.073 --> 01:09:51.908
Hi, Miners fans. Thanks for joining us
at a packed house in the Pacific Northwest.

01:09:51.978 --> 01:09:56.540
The question: Will the Miners. In the last
regular season game here in Seattle.

01:09:56.616 --> 01:10:00.347
Take the number-one spot
in the NC 2A polls?

01:10:00.419 --> 01:10:06.153
Adolph Rupp's fabled Wildcats dropped
a nail-biter to Tennessee last night.

01:10:06.225 --> 01:10:09.661
And that will allow the Miners.
If they win here tonight.

01:10:09.729 --> 01:10:12.562
To take the number-one spot
in the nation.

01:10:13.966 --> 01:10:18.630
Hey, Lattin, you didn't jump high enough
to get toilet paper under your shoe.

01:10:20.039 --> 01:10:22.269
The Chieftains go down
for an easy lay-up.

01:10:22.341 --> 01:10:26.277
Miners making it a little too easy
for the Chieftains at this point.

01:10:26.345 --> 01:10:28.245
Armstrong down low.

01:10:28.314 --> 01:10:33.877
Armstrong's wide open. Flournoy looks
down there. Will not pass the ball.

01:10:33.953 --> 01:10:36.888
He wants to go it alone.
Launches a 20-footer. It's off the mark.

01:10:36.956 --> 01:10:39.049
Come on, man, I was wide open.

01:10:46.199 --> 01:10:47.689
Hill, we're in orange tonight.

01:10:47.767 --> 01:10:51.168
- Come on, Shed, meet the pass.
- Don't worry about me.

01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:59.707
The Miners are just playing flat.

01:10:59.779 --> 01:11:01.906
Your guy just got by you, Hill.

01:11:01.981 --> 01:11:05.883
There's no chemistry. No energy.
It's every man for themselves out there.

01:11:05.952 --> 01:11:09.888
They're not playing like a team.
That jump was no good.

01:11:14.794 --> 01:11:18.924
- Coach, you're in my chair.
- I like the view better down here.

01:11:20.633 --> 01:11:22.897
Eight minutes to play.
And I hate to say this.

01:11:22.969 --> 01:11:25.995
But it looks like
our Miners have given up.

01:11:36.649 --> 01:11:38.344
(no audio)

01:11:38.417 --> 01:11:40.408
They've got only themselves
to blame.

01:11:40.486 --> 01:11:42.920
They didn't play together
or find the open man.

01:11:42.989 --> 01:11:47.119
And the Miners' perfect season
is slipping away.

01:11:49.462 --> 01:11:52.158
(woman humming)

01:12:07.947 --> 01:12:09.244
Ohh!

01:12:14.353 --> 01:12:17.220
(buzzer signals end of the game)

01:12:21.627 --> 01:12:24.061
You stunk out there tonight!

01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:27.588
Squeaky could have played better D
than you did.

01:12:27.667 --> 01:12:30.431
And, Shed, are you kiddin' me?

01:12:30.503 --> 01:12:34.599
That was the same ol' weak,
scared Shed out there.

01:12:34.674 --> 01:12:39.839
Maybe you thought what used to be
an undefeated record meant something.

01:12:39.912 --> 01:12:42.540
That we could just waltz
our way in the tournament.

01:12:42.615 --> 01:12:46.711
- Maybe these crackers is getting to us.
- Why you looking at me, Bobby Joe?

01:12:46.786 --> 01:12:49.584
You a cracker, ain't you?

01:12:49.655 --> 01:12:52.954
Coach, the more we win,
the harder it is for us out there.

01:12:53.025 --> 01:12:56.517
What do you suggest we do, Shed?
Lose?

01:12:56.595 --> 01:12:58.426
Give them what they want?

01:12:58.497 --> 01:13:02.490
You think basketball is everything, Coach.
And that's easy for you to say.

01:13:02.568 --> 01:13:05.366
But you don't have rednecks
in your face all the time.

01:13:05.438 --> 01:13:10.603
None of you white boys get it because you
don't have people breaking into your room

01:13:10.676 --> 01:13:12.303
or shoving your head in toilets.

01:13:12.378 --> 01:13:13.777
(Armstrong) It's not us.

01:13:13.846 --> 01:13:16.747
White is white, Green Acres,
and that means you too.

01:13:16.816 --> 01:13:21.082
Yeah, I'm white. And you've never been
able to see past that! We're not like them!

01:13:21.153 --> 01:13:24.145
Think we haven't had heat
come down on us?

01:13:24.223 --> 01:13:27.954
You're the ones out there skating by,
while we're out there sweating blood.

01:13:28.027 --> 01:13:33.329
You think it's easy being on this team?
Taking a backseat to you every day?

01:13:33.399 --> 01:13:37.165
We came here to play basketball,
just like you guys!

01:13:37.236 --> 01:13:40.535
Now it's like we don't even count.
We're the minority!

01:13:40.606 --> 01:13:44.975
I don't wanna hear that from you. I have
been the minority every day of my life.

01:13:45.044 --> 01:13:50.414
And you're crying because you spent
the last few months in our shadows?

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:57.480
Welcome to the back of the bus,
white boy.

01:13:57.556 --> 01:14:02.220
I wish y'all would just sit back here
and listen to yourselves.

01:14:02.895 --> 01:14:09.767
It's worse than losing the game.
You've all forgotten what you're doing here.

01:14:12.271 --> 01:14:16.207
What do you wanna do?
You wanna quit?

01:14:16.275 --> 01:14:21.076
- They're trying to take our dignity from us.
- Your dignity's inside you.

01:14:21.147 --> 01:14:25.083
Nobody can take something away from you
you don't give them.

01:14:26.218 --> 01:14:27.446
Hey.

01:14:29.522 --> 01:14:31.615
Hold your heads up.

01:14:33.192 --> 01:14:35.558
Hold your heads up.

01:14:36.162 --> 01:14:38.687
You wanna shake off that hate?

01:14:41.567 --> 01:14:46.561
It's your choice, Harry Flournoy.
It's your choice, Jerry Armstrong.

01:14:46.639 --> 01:14:48.334
Togo.

01:14:48.407 --> 01:14:51.274
Cager, Hill, it's your choice.

01:14:51.343 --> 01:14:53.971
Shut them up.

01:14:54.046 --> 01:14:55.445
Win.

01:14:56.382 --> 01:14:58.976
The NCAA Tournament gets off
to a rip-roaring start

01:14:59.051 --> 01:15:03.317
as the powerhouse Kansas Jayhawks
take on the upstart Texas Western Miners.

01:15:03.389 --> 01:15:06.415
(Cager) Thank you
for keeping us together.

01:15:06.492 --> 01:15:10.929
Lord, we ask that you see us through,
no matter what the obstacles.

01:15:10.996 --> 01:15:13.794
No matter how high the mountains.

01:15:14.767 --> 01:15:17.634
- Amen.
- (all) Amen.

01:15:17.703 --> 01:15:19.967
(Cager) Let's go, guys.
Let's get this game.

01:15:19.971 --> 01:15:24.601
While the Texas Western club has turned
heads across the country with this roster,

01:15:24.676 --> 01:15:27.736
it's safe to say that Haskins' experiment
should end tonight.

01:15:37.822 --> 01:15:40.655
- Coach?
- You must be Mrs. Cager.

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:46.920
- Thanks for seeing me before the game.
- I know you come a long way, so...

01:15:46.998 --> 01:15:50.525
You have too.
You know, you're all he talks about.

01:15:51.169 --> 01:15:56.698
"Coach said this" and "Coach said that."
So I said, "Let me meet this man."

01:15:56.775 --> 01:16:00.267
Well, Mrs. Cager, your son's
all a coach could ever ask for.

01:16:00.345 --> 01:16:03.712
He's hard working, he's unselfish.

01:16:03.782 --> 01:16:08.947
Tell you the truth, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Willie.

01:16:09.621 --> 01:16:13.148
Mr. Haskins, I came to ask you
to let him play.

01:16:17.162 --> 01:16:20.791
Mrs. Cager, the thing is,
his condition is just...

01:16:20.865 --> 01:16:24.130
I know about it better than anyone.

01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:28.530
This is his time.

01:16:28.606 --> 01:16:31.905
These are the last games
he'll ever play.

01:16:33.078 --> 01:16:36.946
I don't care if it's just five minutes
or five seconds.

01:16:37.015 --> 01:16:40.917
Just... let him play.

01:16:45.957 --> 01:16:49.654
Led by all-American JoJo White.
The number-six Jayhawks are. With Duke.

01:16:49.728 --> 01:16:54.165
The favorites to challenge Rupp and
Kentucky for basketball's holy grail.

01:16:54.232 --> 01:16:56.257
That's the all-American.

01:16:56.334 --> 01:16:58.598
All press clippings.

01:16:58.670 --> 01:17:01.764
- Think so?
- He's all talk too.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:05.276
(cheerleaders cheer in background)

01:17:16.087 --> 01:17:21.548
Bobby Joe Hill will set up
the Texas Miner offense in the front court.

01:17:22.227 --> 01:17:24.058
Stolen! JoJo White.

01:17:24.129 --> 01:17:26.597
(commentator #2) Tremendous
anticipation defensively by White.

01:17:26.664 --> 01:17:29.633
Easy pass and a dunk,
and a four-nothing Jayhawk lead.

01:17:29.701 --> 01:17:32.670
You gotta protect the ball, Hill!

01:17:32.737 --> 01:17:34.728
Ball in to Wesley.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.374
He just overpowers Lattin.

01:17:37.442 --> 01:17:40.741
(commentator #2) Wesley trying to
intimidate Lattin early on in the game.

01:17:40.812 --> 01:17:43.007
(crowd) Defense! Defense!

01:17:45.183 --> 01:17:47.981
(commentator) White extends
the Jayhawk lead to five.

01:17:48.053 --> 01:17:51.750
(commentator #2) But more importantly
now Kansas has all the momentum.

01:17:51.823 --> 01:17:54.986
(commentator) It looks like Haskins
is going to go to his bench.

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:56.925
He's calling for Willie Cager.

01:17:56.995 --> 01:18:00.123
(commentator #2) Cager missed
half the season with heart problems.

01:18:00.198 --> 01:18:03.599
But the Miners sure could use
a lift right now.

01:18:06.404 --> 01:18:09.271
(commentator) Now Cager
from the top of the key.

01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.830
It's good!

01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:16.440
Hey, welcome home, son! That's a good
play, Cager! Way to be out there!

01:18:16.514 --> 01:18:18.505
- That's my son.
- Plays good.

01:18:20.185 --> 01:18:23.621
(commentator #2) JoJo White
into the front court. 22-footer.

01:18:23.688 --> 01:18:25.178
It's good!

01:18:25.256 --> 01:18:27.884
Bobby Joe Hill looking to answer
for the Miners.

01:18:27.959 --> 01:18:29.017
And he'll score!

01:18:29.094 --> 01:18:33.190
(commentator #2) And these two point
guards are really putting on a show.

01:18:33.264 --> 01:18:36.995
(commentator) It's JoJo's turn.
From the wing. He looks unstoppable!

01:18:37.068 --> 01:18:38.763
And Coach Haskins calls time.

01:18:38.837 --> 01:18:42.796
Y'all are paying so much attention
to their jerseys that you're playing tight.

01:18:42.874 --> 01:18:47.538
JoJo's having a big night, so I'm making a
change. Armstrong, you're in for Worsley.

01:18:47.612 --> 01:18:51.275
Now, if you can stop him, bottom line is
we're gonna win this game.

01:18:51.349 --> 01:18:54.716
- Don't worry. I'll take care of him.
- Let's go to work.

01:18:54.786 --> 01:18:56.777
On three.

01:18:56.855 --> 01:18:58.584
- Let's go, team.
- One, two, three!

01:18:58.656 --> 01:19:00.180
Miners!

01:19:10.201 --> 01:19:11.532
That's good D, son.

01:19:12.637 --> 01:19:17.131
(commentator) Lattin. Back door to Shed.
And he'll lay it in for two.

01:19:23.548 --> 01:19:25.243
(grumbles)

01:19:27.819 --> 01:19:31.516
(commentator #2) Here in the second half.
Armstrong has shut down JoJo White.

01:19:31.589 --> 01:19:34.490
We need a stop!
We need a stop!

01:19:37.362 --> 01:19:40.229
(commentator) Kansas scores.
And they lead by two!

01:19:40.298 --> 01:19:42.596
- Seven seconds! Push the ball!
- Seven seconds!

01:19:42.667 --> 01:19:45.158
No time-outs for the Miners!

01:19:50.008 --> 01:19:52.636
Long inbound to Lattin.

01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:56.544
Back out to Hill. To the basket!

01:19:56.614 --> 01:19:58.514
Cager! He got it!

01:19:59.918 --> 01:20:01.613
(commentator #2) What a play!

01:20:01.686 --> 01:20:06.055
He wasn't expected to play tonight.
But he saved the season for the Miners!

01:20:06.124 --> 01:20:10.686
Overtime! Hey, you got an overtime!
Hey, get in here! We got an overtime!

01:20:10.762 --> 01:20:14.630
(commentator #2) And we'll play overtime
to settle this one!

01:20:19.637 --> 01:20:21.798
That's the way to go! That's it!

01:20:25.076 --> 01:20:28.534
(commentator) Just seconds remaining.

01:20:28.613 --> 01:20:30.604
Artis. Up to Lattin.

01:20:30.682 --> 01:20:34.584
It's good! And the Miners win!
The Miners win!

01:20:34.652 --> 01:20:39.180
(commentator #2) They're calling it
hanging on the rim! I can't believe it!

01:20:39.257 --> 01:20:42.226
(commentator) A foul called
against David Lattin.

01:20:42.293 --> 01:20:45.524
The basket will count
and Kansas will shoot two free throws

01:20:45.597 --> 01:20:48.589
to try to send the game
to a second overtime.

01:21:05.516 --> 01:21:09.282
(commentator) JoJo makes both.
And we're going to a second overtime.

01:21:09.354 --> 01:21:10.946
All right, bring it in!

01:21:11.022 --> 01:21:13.616
Oh. Is this a game for the record books!

01:21:13.691 --> 01:21:15.625
We got a great mismatch, a little low.

01:21:15.693 --> 01:21:19.288
So we're gonna swing in the ball
and let him take his man one on one.

01:21:19.364 --> 01:21:21.195
You got it? All right, let's do it.

01:21:22.333 --> 01:21:24.301
(buzzer signals start of second overtime)

01:21:24.369 --> 01:21:29.363
OK, here we go. The winner moves on
for the national championship.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:32.034
Lattin. Cross-court pass to Artis.

01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:34.670
He'll drive the baseline and score!

01:21:34.746 --> 01:21:38.341
The Jayhawk defender really bit
on that fake. And the Miners lead by one.

01:21:38.416 --> 01:21:40.884
Kansas needs a basket to win.
Where they going?

01:21:40.952 --> 01:21:43.819
(commentator #2) Everyone knows
who will take this shot -

01:21:43.888 --> 01:21:46.550
it's their all-American JoJo White.

01:21:49.694 --> 01:21:52.492
(commentator) Ball goes in to JoJo!

01:21:52.563 --> 01:21:54.326
From the sideline!

01:21:56.301 --> 01:22:00.067
It's good! Kansas wins! Kansas wins!

01:22:03.908 --> 01:22:07.935
(commentator #2) Wait a minute. Ralph!
It looks like he stepped on the line.

01:22:08.012 --> 01:22:10.810
I think the official's going
to wave the basket off.

01:22:10.882 --> 01:22:16.047
(commentator) It's no good! And Texas
Western's improbable story continues

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:20.580
with an 81-80 double overtime win
over the Kansas Jayhawks.

01:22:28.066 --> 01:22:30.694
Have you seen this?
Have you read this already?

01:22:30.768 --> 01:22:31.962
(Don) I read it.

01:22:32.036 --> 01:22:36.302
It says, "The selfless support of Texas
Western's booster Wade Richardsons,

01:22:36.374 --> 01:22:40.902
which has made this breakout team's rise
a true phenomenon in the sports world."

01:22:40.978 --> 01:22:44.379
Well, they got you down,
didn't they, sir?

01:22:44.449 --> 01:22:46.849
Just forget all that stuff I said before.

01:22:46.918 --> 01:22:51.514
I've been selling more dinettes than
I've sold in the last four years combined.

01:22:51.589 --> 01:22:54.490
(overlapping chatter)

01:22:54.559 --> 01:22:58.893
You're 24 hours from the biggest game
in college basketball. How do you feel?

01:22:58.963 --> 01:23:00.726
You know, I've been here before.

01:23:00.798 --> 01:23:03.596
It's been some time now,
but I've had some success here

01:23:03.668 --> 01:23:06.762
and I feel like I'm coming home, really.

01:23:06.838 --> 01:23:09.068
I'm just glad to be here.

01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:12.132
I'd like to ask you
about your controversial win over Kansas.

01:23:12.210 --> 01:23:17.807
There's no controversy. JoJo White
stepped out of bounds. They lost, we won.

01:23:26.524 --> 01:23:30.824
Coach Haskins, how do you plan on
stopping Louie Dampier and Pat Riley?

01:23:30.895 --> 01:23:34.854
Ask Coach Rupp how he plans on
stopping David Lattin and Bobby Joe Hill.

01:23:34.932 --> 01:23:35.899
Who?

01:23:35.967 --> 01:23:37.559
(reporters chuckle)

01:23:37.635 --> 01:23:39.262
You have to admit. Coach Rupp.

01:23:39.337 --> 01:23:43.398
That the Negro player is changing
the game of basketball.

01:23:43.474 --> 01:23:44.463
Oh?

01:23:44.542 --> 01:23:51.243
Well, as far as I know, basketball's about
taking the basketball, putting it in the hoop.

01:23:51.816 --> 01:23:56.344
And you can quote me.
I don't think that's going to change.

01:23:56.421 --> 01:23:59.185
(woman) That horrible man,
playing those coloreds.

01:23:59.257 --> 01:24:01.817
And where are you from, sweetheart?

01:24:01.893 --> 01:24:06.557
El Paso, Texas. I'm married to that
horrible man you were just talking about.

01:24:06.631 --> 01:24:10.931
Coach Rupp, what do you think of their
lightning-quick guard, Bobby Joe Hill?

01:24:11.002 --> 01:24:14.597
He's a good boy. But there's lots
of good boys out there this year.

01:24:14.672 --> 01:24:17.732
Well. This good little boy led us
to 23 and one.

01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:21.642
Well, I think you understood my point.

01:24:21.712 --> 01:24:27.116
My point is that we at Kentucky don't worry
about the boys in other uniforms.

01:24:27.185 --> 01:24:28.675
We play our game.

01:24:31.656 --> 01:24:37.151
Don't pay them any mind.
It's just how some people were raised.

01:24:37.228 --> 01:24:40.026
Well, they weren't raised right.

01:24:40.097 --> 01:24:42.292
I guess not.

01:24:43.901 --> 01:24:47.234
But not everybody thinks like that.

01:24:48.573 --> 01:24:51.508
My name is Esther.

01:24:51.576 --> 01:24:53.669
Esther Rupp.

01:24:54.378 --> 01:24:59.008
Nice to meet you. Mary Haskins.

01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:02.949
Let's get this game over with
so we can get back to Memphis.

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:07.719
Well, one thing's for sure -
can't no five niggers beat five white boys.

01:25:08.693 --> 01:25:12.993
Yeah. Just black trash, that's all they are.
They think they belong here.

01:25:13.064 --> 01:25:14.497
Harris. That's enough.

01:25:14.565 --> 01:25:18.228
- Wait, I'm just getting started here. Hold it.
- (laughter)

01:25:18.736 --> 01:25:22.832
(Don) Maybe old Coach Rupp still
has a thing to learn about basketball.

01:25:22.907 --> 01:25:27.037
These boys are playing
for more than just the championship.

01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:31.810
When I came here...

01:25:34.585 --> 01:25:36.849
I didn't wanna come.

01:25:38.890 --> 01:25:41.723
I didn't wanna be a part of this.

01:25:43.227 --> 01:25:45.752
But I was wrong, Don.

01:25:46.797 --> 01:25:48.958
I was wrong.

01:26:41.152 --> 01:26:43.882
You know, my dad called.

01:26:43.955 --> 01:26:49.723
He said everybody in town's going to
Thelma's Steakhouse to watch the game.

01:26:53.264 --> 01:26:55.755
He said he was proud of me.

01:26:55.833 --> 01:27:01.271
It was always just a game to me. But now
it feels like a lot more than a game.

01:27:01.339 --> 01:27:06.367
Yeah, I know what you mean, brother.
Feels like my whole life.

01:27:06.444 --> 01:27:10.403
My folks are driving down
with Willie's parents.

01:27:10.481 --> 01:27:13.814
My old man's coming too.

01:27:13.884 --> 01:27:20.687
He was always a baseball fan.
But I think he's finally liking basketball.

01:27:20.758 --> 01:27:23.158
Bobby Joe. You hear me, man?

01:27:24.095 --> 01:27:28.156
This ain't gonna be nothing.
It's just a day at the playground.

01:27:28.232 --> 01:27:30.223
(telephone ringing)

01:27:35.506 --> 01:27:36.632
Hello?

01:27:44.482 --> 01:27:46.848
Take a look out there.

01:27:47.852 --> 01:27:50.412
We can't win tomorrow night.

01:27:52.523 --> 01:27:55.390
You're not a championship team.

01:27:56.327 --> 01:28:01.060
You've been lucky so far,
but tomorrow your luck's gonna run out.

01:28:04.001 --> 01:28:07.164
To win at this level, you gotta have a...

01:28:09.707 --> 01:28:13.438
intelligence inside you out on that court.

01:28:14.245 --> 01:28:16.645
You gotta be able to think.

01:28:16.714 --> 01:28:20.115
We just got too much
of the wrong complexion.

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.055
You're athletes, sure.

01:28:26.123 --> 01:28:29.149
But so are monkeys.

01:28:31.996 --> 01:28:33.054
Mm-hm.

01:28:33.130 --> 01:28:35.963
You can run. You can jump.

01:28:36.033 --> 01:28:39.696
Maybe even hit the occasional outside shot
with the right training,

01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:42.568
but to compete against a real team...

01:28:46.177 --> 01:28:53.083
Well, should I go on, or you as sick
of this same old tired line of BS as I am?

01:28:57.888 --> 01:29:03.884
I'm so sick of it, tonight I made a decision
that we're gonna put a stop to it forever.

01:29:07.331 --> 01:29:09.765
Lattin.

01:29:09.834 --> 01:29:11.324
Flournoy.

01:29:11.402 --> 01:29:13.962
Artis, Cager, Worsley, Hill.

01:29:15.506 --> 01:29:16.666
Shed.

01:29:19.477 --> 01:29:22.002
Five starters, two subs.

01:29:22.079 --> 01:29:24.138
40 minutes, seven players.

01:29:24.215 --> 01:29:29.084
I'm only gonna play the black players
in the final game tomorrow.

01:29:29.153 --> 01:29:31.383
Just you.

01:29:31.455 --> 01:29:33.821
Togo, Armstrong, Palacio,

01:29:33.891 --> 01:29:36.359
Myers, Baudoin.

01:29:37.394 --> 01:29:41.558
I know how hard every one of you worked
to get here. I don't wanna hurt any of you.

01:29:41.632 --> 01:29:44.931
Coach. I can't lie.

01:29:45.002 --> 01:29:47.197
I wanna play.

01:29:48.105 --> 01:29:50.938
I do. We all wanna play.

01:29:54.645 --> 01:29:58.604
But I just wanna say one thing.

01:30:01.452 --> 01:30:03.443
Tomorrow night,

01:30:03.521 --> 01:30:10.324
y'all go out there and show 'em how bad
five brothers can be on the court.

01:30:12.763 --> 01:30:14.754
OK?

01:30:16.967 --> 01:30:22.303
Flournoy, if you don't get back and play
defense, I'll be all over your black butt.

01:30:33.984 --> 01:30:37.215
Good evening and welcome
to the Cole Field House for the finals

01:30:37.288 --> 01:30:39.813
of the NCAA Championship game

01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:44.987
between the University of Kentucky
and Texas Western College.

01:30:45.062 --> 01:30:47.553
And here come the Miners.

01:30:57.775 --> 01:31:00.573
When this tournament began.
Virtually everybody

01:31:00.644 --> 01:31:02.612
could have predicted one of our finalists.

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:05.478
But I don't think anyone
could have predicted the other.

01:31:05.549 --> 01:31:09.110
It's Texas Western College
against the University of Kentucky

01:31:09.186 --> 01:31:11.711
for the NCAA Championship.

01:31:11.789 --> 01:31:14.417
A little mining college from
out in West Texas.

01:31:14.491 --> 01:31:18.552
A scrappy bunch with an unusual lineup
going against basketball royalty.

01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:23.066
The Baron of the Bluegrass
and his four NCAA men's championships.

01:31:23.133 --> 01:31:25.931
If there was ever more of a mismatch,
I don't remember it.

01:31:26.003 --> 01:31:29.336
Here's tonight's starting lineup
for the Kentucky Wildcats.

01:31:29.406 --> 01:31:32.569
At guard number 30, six-three,
Tommy Kron.

01:31:32.643 --> 01:31:35.043
The Cats are led
by two great all-Americans.

01:31:35.112 --> 01:31:40.106
First of all. Sharp-shooting Louie Dampier
and the high-scoring Pat Riley.

01:31:40.184 --> 01:31:42.345
These guys play with speed.

01:31:42.419 --> 01:31:46.321
They play with poise
and they play with intelligence.

01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:50.121
(announcer) And the coach of
the Kentucky Wildcats. Adolph Rupp.

01:31:50.194 --> 01:31:54.597
Now here's the starting lineup
for the Texas Western Miners.

01:31:54.665 --> 01:31:59.830
At guard. Out of Detroit. Michigan.
Number 14. five-ten. Bobby Joe Hill.

01:31:59.904 --> 01:32:03.965
At the other guard, number 24,
five-six Willie Worsley.

01:32:04.041 --> 01:32:09.035
At center. From Houston. Texas.
Number 43. six-seven. David Lattin.

01:32:09.113 --> 01:32:12.844
At forward. Number 44. six-five.
Harry Flournoy.

01:32:12.917 --> 01:32:16.045
At the other forward. Number 20.
Orsten Artis.

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:20.022
And the coach of the Texas Western
Miners. Don Haskins.

01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:22.957
(commentator) We have a
David-versus-Goliath match-up.

01:32:23.027 --> 01:32:27.327
Texas Western against Kentucky
for the NCAA Championship.

01:32:27.398 --> 01:32:30.697
You had a great season, Coach.
You must be thrilled to be here.

01:32:33.137 --> 01:32:35.401
- One, two, three.
- (all) Miners!

01:32:36.307 --> 01:32:39.037
You three guards are in there
to stop their fast break.

01:32:39.109 --> 01:32:41.202
Make them have to walk it down the court.

01:32:41.278 --> 01:32:44.714
You saw who they put on the floor.
They're gonna try to run against us.

01:32:44.782 --> 01:32:48.980
In an unprecedented move, Coach
Haskins is starting five Negro players.

01:32:49.053 --> 01:32:52.682
- That's a spit in the face.
- A first in NCAA Championship history.

01:32:52.756 --> 01:32:56.920
Now I want you to get angry. Go out there
first time you get the ball and dunk it.

01:32:56.994 --> 01:32:59.963
I don't care if you have
to run someone over to do it.

01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:01.793
We're faster.
We can spit right back.

01:33:01.865 --> 01:33:03.526
Send 'em a message. Get in there.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.330
They're the one that got a chip
on their shoulder, not us.

01:33:06.403 --> 01:33:09.429
It ain't about nothing except basketball.
One, two, three!

01:33:09.506 --> 01:33:10.996
Miners!

01:33:11.075 --> 01:33:14.977
Dampier's a great ball handler. You try
to take it from him, he's gonna burn you.

01:33:15.045 --> 01:33:17.809
- Come on, Coach.
- Some say he's the best guard.

01:33:17.881 --> 01:33:20.782
If I had a choice between him and you,
I'd choose you.

01:33:20.851 --> 01:33:23.843
That's good, 'cause you know
he wouldn't have chose me.

01:33:23.921 --> 01:33:25.218
(horn blows)

01:33:25.422 --> 01:33:26.912
(cheering)

01:33:30.027 --> 01:33:33.690
The opening tap.
Big David Lattin against Pat Riley.

01:33:38.335 --> 01:33:41.133
And the tap is controlled
by Texas Western.

01:33:41.205 --> 01:33:45.403
Worsley gives it to Bobby Joe Hill.
Now Hill rockets a pass into Lattin.

01:33:45.476 --> 01:33:47.341
And he dunks it over Riley.

01:33:47.411 --> 01:33:49.572
Aah!

01:33:49.646 --> 01:33:50.704
Yeah!

01:33:50.781 --> 01:33:52.874
(cheering)

01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:57.387
- He was making a statement with that.
- And Adolph Rupp looks disgusted.

01:33:57.454 --> 01:34:01.823
Now Kentucky on offense for the first time.
The ball in the hands of Louie Dampier.

01:34:01.892 --> 01:34:04.588
Texas Western in a man-to-man.
He gets it to Conley.

01:34:04.661 --> 01:34:08.427
He's got a mismatch on Worsley. Backs
him down and scores. We're tied at two.

01:34:08.499 --> 01:34:12.367
Conley, that's gonna be there
all night long.

01:34:12.436 --> 01:34:16.930
The Miners work the ball into David Lattin.
He spins outta the double team. Scores.

01:34:17.007 --> 01:34:18.235
There it is. There it is.

01:34:18.308 --> 01:34:22.677
(commentator #2) It's six-seven. 240
pounds of a powerhouse in the middle.

01:34:22.746 --> 01:34:25.544
Wildcats get the ball to the high post.
Thad Jaracz has it.

01:34:25.616 --> 01:34:28.380
- Slow it down. Set it up.
- Lattin, get physical.

01:34:28.452 --> 01:34:31.216
They cut off him.
He puts it on the floor. Goes to the hoop.

01:34:31.288 --> 01:34:33.916
And he is fouled
and fouled hard by David Lattin.

01:34:33.991 --> 01:34:37.256
That's a flagrant foul!
You gonna call that, ref?

01:34:37.327 --> 01:34:41.627
That's a flagrant foul! You want there to be
a melee? Someone's gonna get hurt here.

01:34:41.698 --> 01:34:43.256
I'll call the foul. Two shots.

01:34:43.333 --> 01:34:45.358
A pair of free throws ties the game
at 12.

01:34:45.436 --> 01:34:48.166
But the Baron is not happy
on the Kentucky bench.

01:34:48.238 --> 01:34:51.469
Texas Western very disciplined
against this Kentucky zone.

01:34:51.542 --> 01:34:54.636
They work the ball down low to Lattin.
He goes up for the shot.

01:34:54.711 --> 01:34:59.171
No good. Offensive rebound.
Flournoy. And he is down and hurt.

01:34:59.249 --> 01:35:00.944
(official) Stay down.
Coach.

01:35:01.018 --> 01:35:02.451
Ohh!

01:35:05.722 --> 01:35:07.952
Where'd he hurt? Harry.

01:35:08.025 --> 01:35:11.017
How'd you come down?
Did it go out or in? Hold still.

01:35:11.095 --> 01:35:13.996
Well, that's one less thing
to worry about.

01:35:17.101 --> 01:35:19.092
Cager, you're in.

01:35:22.339 --> 01:35:25.365
And it looks like Flournoy has
to come out of this game.

01:35:25.442 --> 01:35:28.468
This will be a huge blow
to the Miners if he can't return.

01:35:28.545 --> 01:35:30.012
He's through for the night.

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:34.141
Oh. Boy. This will be tough because he's
a great rebounder for Texas Western.

01:35:34.218 --> 01:35:39.815
At six-five. He is one of the best.
And it'll be a disaster if he can't continue.

01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:42.222
Tough break, son.

01:35:46.396 --> 01:35:49.229
Ten minutes gone
in this fast-paced first half.

01:35:49.299 --> 01:35:52.996
Kentucky with the ball and the lead.
Here's a backdoor cut by Riley.

01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:55.061
He goes up and is slammed to the floor.

01:35:55.139 --> 01:35:57.937
And that'll be number three
on Big David Lattin.

01:35:58.008 --> 01:36:02.342
That really hurts the Miners because this
big guy's been carrying Texas Western

01:36:02.412 --> 01:36:04.209
with his strong inside play.

01:36:04.281 --> 01:36:08.149
Now Don Haskins will have to take
the very physical Lattin out of the game.

01:36:08.218 --> 01:36:09.742
I can't let you foul out.

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:14.484
And it looks like Nevil Shed is replacing
him. But they're giving up something here.

01:36:14.558 --> 01:36:20.019
Riley's first free throw is good. And Coach
Haskins wants a word with Bobby Joe Hill.

01:36:20.797 --> 01:36:24.494
The Wildcats by four now with a chance
to stretch their lead.

01:36:24.568 --> 01:36:27.560
Here's Tommy Kron
bringing the ball up for Kentucky.

01:36:27.638 --> 01:36:30.300
Orsten Artis all over him.
And here comes Hill!

01:36:30.374 --> 01:36:33.901
He strips it away
and he's going in for the lay-up!

01:36:33.977 --> 01:36:36.502
(commentator #2) What a pair of hands.

01:36:37.414 --> 01:36:39.405
(commentator) What a steal by Hill.

01:36:39.483 --> 01:36:41.075
That happens when you don't talk
to each other.

01:36:41.151 --> 01:36:45.485
This time Louie Dampier with the
basketball. He's played by Bobby Joe Hill.

01:36:45.556 --> 01:36:48.047
He steps in and steals it again!
Holy mackerel!

01:36:48.125 --> 01:36:52.061
Bobby Joe Hill picked the lock
on the Fort Knox hands of Louie Dampier.

01:36:52.129 --> 01:36:56.566
And he's got back-to-back steals and
lay-ups. And like that. We're tied again.

01:36:56.633 --> 01:36:58.328
Time-out. Time-out!

01:36:58.402 --> 01:37:02.133
- (commentator #2) Kentucky wants time.
- (blows whistle) Time-out. White.

01:37:02.206 --> 01:37:03.138
Yes.

01:37:07.044 --> 01:37:09.945
Hey, those are two big-time plays, Hill.

01:37:10.013 --> 01:37:12.447
- Are you scared?
- No, sir!

01:37:12.516 --> 01:37:15.246
I know someone who's not scared.
Conley's not.

01:37:15.319 --> 01:37:17.446
We don't teach scared
at the University of Kentucky.

01:37:17.521 --> 01:37:20.888
I need you standing there waiting for 'em
when they come outta time-out,

01:37:20.958 --> 01:37:22.653
like a force, like a wall!

01:37:22.726 --> 01:37:26.287
Don't let that guy crowd you!
Get him out of there.

01:37:26.363 --> 01:37:30.060
This the national championship.
Are you surprised? They come to play.

01:37:30.133 --> 01:37:34.126
So we got to play back. We know how
to play this game better than anybody.

01:37:34.204 --> 01:37:35.967
Play the game. Let's go.

01:37:36.039 --> 01:37:37.836
Over here!

01:37:40.844 --> 01:37:42.641
Yeah!

01:37:44.648 --> 01:37:46.138
Set it up, set it up.

01:37:46.216 --> 01:37:49.743
(Wildcat player) Defense, defense!
Watch Hill. Inside!

01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:51.185
Whoa! Whoa!

01:37:55.058 --> 01:37:57.356
That's it. That's what I want.

01:38:03.166 --> 01:38:05.191
(cheering)

01:38:07.237 --> 01:38:08.226
Whoo!

01:38:10.507 --> 01:38:12.873
Inside of ten seconds to go. First half.

01:38:12.943 --> 01:38:17.039
Jaracz with the ball. High post.
Looking for Riley. Running off a screen.

01:38:17.114 --> 01:38:19.344
Here's a shot at the buzzer.

01:38:19.416 --> 01:38:21.111
It's good!

01:38:25.589 --> 01:38:28.353
(commentator) We're all a little shocked.

01:38:28.425 --> 01:38:31.223
Texas Western is leading Kentucky
at the half.

01:38:31.295 --> 01:38:34.093
(commentator #2) But the smart money
has to be on Kentucky

01:38:34.164 --> 01:38:37.327
'cause they were firing on all cylinders
to end the half.

01:38:37.401 --> 01:38:39.164
The Miners did have some big plays.

01:38:39.236 --> 01:38:42.228
But must be concerned with the three fouls
on David Lattin

01:38:42.306 --> 01:38:44.433
as well as the injury to Harry Flournoy.

01:38:44.508 --> 01:38:46.066
He will not return.

01:38:52.215 --> 01:38:55.048
- Yo, hurry up, you late.
- Close the door. Come on.

01:38:55.118 --> 01:38:57.586
They're getting ready
to start the second half.

01:38:57.654 --> 01:38:58.916
... crowning a champion.

01:38:58.989 --> 01:39:01.981
Don't let that cocky kid set a tent up
under the basket.

01:39:02.059 --> 01:39:06.086
If he gets position on you, it'll throw down
every time. Get him out of there!

01:39:06.163 --> 01:39:11.191
I'm putting you in with three fouls, Lattin.
You gotta play smart and protect the paint.

01:39:11.268 --> 01:39:15.102
He's trying to figure out how to get you
to foul out, so keep your feet on the ground.

01:39:15.172 --> 01:39:18.266
- Get a body on him. I want him outta there.
- OK? You ready?

01:39:18.342 --> 01:39:20.708
- Are you the University of Kentucky?
- Yes, sir.

01:39:20.777 --> 01:39:22.836
What has the Baron designed
for his Wildcats?

01:39:22.913 --> 01:39:26.508
- Come on, number ten.
- Wildcats give the ball to Louie Dampier.

01:39:26.583 --> 01:39:27.607
Get your hand up!

01:39:27.684 --> 01:39:30.175
- Here's his long jump shot.
- There it is.

01:39:30.253 --> 01:39:32.448
And the Kentucky fans are on their feet.

01:39:32.522 --> 01:39:33.955
Come on, get back!

01:39:34.024 --> 01:39:37.516
The Miners feed it inside to Lattin.
And Riley steals it away.

01:39:37.594 --> 01:39:40.461
Now Kentucky looks to break.
Tommy Kron on the point.

01:39:40.530 --> 01:39:43.761
Feeds it to Riley. Who beats Lattin
to the basket and lays it in for two!

01:39:43.834 --> 01:39:45.927
Now. That is Kentucky basketball.

01:39:46.002 --> 01:39:47.492
That's it, that's it.

01:39:47.571 --> 01:39:51.632
Kentucky trapping outta their zone.
And Kron takes it away from Worsley.

01:39:51.708 --> 01:39:55.371
The Wildcats look to run again.
Fast break ahead to Riley.

01:39:55.445 --> 01:39:58.243
And that is back-to-back hoops
for the all-American.

01:39:58.315 --> 01:40:02.376
I don't know what Coach Rupp told his
team at halftime. But they are on fire.

01:40:02.452 --> 01:40:05.046
This is how the number-one team
in the nation plays.

01:40:05.122 --> 01:40:08.558
Here's Riley on the move to the basket.
And Lattin fouls him again.

01:40:08.625 --> 01:40:11.219
(referee) Foul. Miners, number 43!

01:40:11.294 --> 01:40:14.991
And that will send the big center
to the bench with his fourth foul.

01:40:15.065 --> 01:40:16.464
That's aggressive play.

01:40:16.533 --> 01:40:20.162
The Miners are hanging in.
But that's gotta hurt on both ends.

01:40:20.237 --> 01:40:23.001
Hey, there's a lot of ball on that, ref.

01:40:27.411 --> 01:40:31.370
I know Lattin's out. But you can't do this
all by yourself. Just slow it down.

01:40:31.448 --> 01:40:33.006
OK? Get everybody involved.

01:40:35.318 --> 01:40:38.651
And Kentucky leads by eight
with ten minutes to play.

01:40:38.722 --> 01:40:40.713
Ball! Ball, ball!

01:40:41.992 --> 01:40:45.189
Bobby Joe Hill will fire one up
from 25 feet.

01:40:45.262 --> 01:40:46.286
And he got it!

01:40:46.363 --> 01:40:47.523
Check him! Check him!

01:40:47.597 --> 01:40:48.757
Whoo!

01:40:48.832 --> 01:40:51.164
Defense, now, defense!

01:40:57.007 --> 01:40:59.475
Way to penetrate. That's what I want.

01:41:02.012 --> 01:41:03.502
Ah, ha-ha!

01:41:08.919 --> 01:41:10.011
Yes!

01:41:22.766 --> 01:41:25.860
Cager's spun it off the glass.
And the Miners lead by three!

01:41:25.936 --> 01:41:29.702
Time. Time! Time-out, Wildcats!

01:41:30.574 --> 01:41:32.132
Coach Rupp calls time.
He's seen enough.

01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:37.406
Miners lead at 64-61.
Just two minutes left.

01:41:44.688 --> 01:41:49.352
All season, when you had nothing left,
you come up with it. And you had success.

01:41:49.426 --> 01:41:51.291
You did it, you did it.

01:41:51.361 --> 01:41:54.819
And that's how we got here, from your
efforts. From your efforts, we're here.

01:41:54.898 --> 01:41:59.164
We are two minutes from a championship.
Lattin, I'm putting you back in.

01:41:59.236 --> 01:42:02.069
Right now it's not about talent -
it's about heart.

01:42:02.138 --> 01:42:05.539
It's about who can go out there
and play the hardest and the smartest.

01:42:05.609 --> 01:42:07.668
This team's a special team.

01:42:08.945 --> 01:42:11.175
Special team.

01:42:12.516 --> 01:42:14.279
You're gonna win this game.

01:42:14.351 --> 01:42:15.909
- You hear that?
- Yes, sir.

01:42:15.986 --> 01:42:20.389
You're gonna win this game.
So go out there and make me a prophet.

01:42:20.457 --> 01:42:22.948
They've been here before -
they won't give it to us.

01:42:23.026 --> 01:42:27.053
We gotta go out there and we gotta take it!
Right? Take it! Take it!

01:42:27.130 --> 01:42:30.031
I want you to go out there and take it!
One, two, three!

01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:31.533
Take it!

01:42:37.641 --> 01:42:42.044
Two minutes to go. And the Miners lead
Adolph Rupp and Kentucky by three.

01:42:42.112 --> 01:42:44.046
Defense! Defense!

01:42:44.114 --> 01:42:45.103
Four-two.

01:42:45.181 --> 01:42:48.309
Louie Dampier guarded tightly
by Bobby Joe Hill.

01:42:48.385 --> 01:42:50.979
He reverses his dribble and fires.
It's good!

01:42:51.054 --> 01:42:52.043
There it is.

01:42:52.122 --> 01:42:54.590
That was a big shot.

01:42:54.658 --> 01:42:56.649
Miners look to answer.

01:42:59.396 --> 01:43:00.954
Yes!

01:43:01.031 --> 01:43:03.591
Wildcats into the front court.
Needing a score.

01:43:03.667 --> 01:43:05.862
Riley breaks free.

01:43:11.708 --> 01:43:13.608
Set it up! Set it up!

01:43:13.677 --> 01:43:16.009
Now who will answer the bell
for the Miners?

01:43:16.079 --> 01:43:18.240
Artis passes it to Cager
at the foul line.

01:43:18.315 --> 01:43:22.479
He slashes around Jaracz.
Takes it right down Main Street.

01:43:26.423 --> 01:43:30.052
So it comes down to this.
18 seconds remain.

01:43:30.126 --> 01:43:32.424
Wildcats with the ball.
In need of a score

01:43:32.495 --> 01:43:35.931
to keep their hopes
of a fifth national championship alive.

01:43:35.999 --> 01:43:40.436
Kentucky looking inside for a mismatch
against the shorter Worsley.

01:43:41.972 --> 01:43:43.997
Stolen away by Bobby Joe.

01:44:04.961 --> 01:44:08.192
Desperation time now for Kentucky
in the final seconds.

01:44:08.264 --> 01:44:11.859
Here's a miss by Kron.
Lattin has the rebound for Texas Western.

01:44:11.935 --> 01:44:16.167
He gives it to Bobby Joe. Looking
at the clock. Watching it count down.

01:44:16.239 --> 01:44:19.037
Ten. Nine. Eight...

01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:22.545
The Miners are on their way to victory.

01:44:23.913 --> 01:44:26.245
(buzzer signals the end of the game)

01:44:29.853 --> 01:44:32.378
Whoo! Whoo!

01:44:32.455 --> 01:44:33.683
(gibberish)

01:44:41.164 --> 01:44:45.100
This is the greatest upset
in NCAA history!

01:44:45.168 --> 01:44:49.502
Texas Western is
the new national champion!

01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:07.213
Whoo!

01:45:07.290 --> 01:45:10.088
National champion!

01:45:21.371 --> 01:45:24.431
Mama, I'm a national champion.

01:45:25.241 --> 01:45:28.039
I'm a national champion.

01:45:28.111 --> 01:45:29.703
Whoo!

01:45:37.153 --> 01:45:39.815
Where is he?
I can't see! Where is he?

01:45:39.889 --> 01:45:42.119
(squeals)

01:45:44.327 --> 01:45:46.591
I love you, Mama. Thank you.

01:49:10.867 --> 01:49:16.772
# To a sun shining through

01:49:16.839 --> 01:49:22.277
# One of these days

01:49:22.345 --> 01:49:25.473
# This song is gonna be true

01:49:25.548 --> 01:49:28.312
# And the world

01:49:28.384 --> 01:49:30.511
# The world

01:49:30.586 --> 01:49:33.749
# Is gonna be brand-new

01:49:33.823 --> 01:49:37.224
# Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Check it out. Y'all

01:49:37.293 --> 01:49:42.595
# One of these days I'm gonna wake up

01:49:42.665 --> 01:49:46.294
# And I'm gonna feel fine

01:49:47.537 --> 01:49:52.668
# One of these days I'm gonna wake up

01:49:52.742 --> 01:49:57.679
# And my dreams are gonna be mine

01:49:57.747 --> 01:50:03.151
# One of these days

01:50:03.219 --> 01:50:06.313
# This song is gonna be true

01:50:06.389 --> 01:50:09.187
# And the world

01:50:09.258 --> 01:50:11.317
# The world

01:50:11.394 --> 01:50:15.262
# Is gonna be brand-new

01:50:15.331 --> 01:50:16.389
# Yeah. Yeah

01:50:16.466 --> 01:50:21.301
# It's gonna sound like music

01:50:21.371 --> 01:50:24.898
# Oh. Sweet music

01:50:27.710 --> 01:50:31.806
# And everybody's gonna want

01:50:31.881 --> 01:50:36.978
# Is gonna sing this song

01:50:37.053 --> 01:50:38.816
# They're gonna say love

01:50:38.888 --> 01:50:44.690
You know, Kentucky's so big,
and Adolph Rupp's name was so big,

01:50:44.761 --> 01:50:49.721
that, I guess,
that made it more significant.

01:50:49.799 --> 01:50:53.394
The initial thought was,
"Do we really have a chance here?"

01:50:53.469 --> 01:50:56.233
We felt their presence
at the beginning of the game,

01:50:56.305 --> 01:50:59.866
when they came out
with this incredible effort and zeal.

01:50:59.942 --> 01:51:05.312
I think the most significant...
It's when David Lattin made his dunk shot -

01:51:05.381 --> 01:51:07.212
that's what really got us going.

01:51:07.283 --> 01:51:11.481
And I went up, and he grabbed it,
and he just kept going up and up and up.

01:51:11.554 --> 01:51:13.545
And he just dunked it
over the top of me.

01:51:13.623 --> 01:51:17.559
He put it down with such ferocity
that it intimidated me.

01:51:17.627 --> 01:51:22.462
And I did tell David before the game,
if he hadn't run over somebody,

01:51:22.532 --> 01:51:25.933
that I wanted him to tear the rim off
a couple of times.

01:51:26.002 --> 01:51:32.168
But those two steals by Bobby Joe Hill
broke our back

01:51:32.241 --> 01:51:36.439
and reinforced what the reality was.

01:51:36.512 --> 01:51:39.879
And the reality was this:

01:51:39.949 --> 01:51:42.110
They were bigger and they were better

01:51:42.185 --> 01:51:46.121
and they were more talented and they were
quicker. They were a better team.

01:51:46.189 --> 01:51:49.750
Kentucky was kind of a tough team
to match up against.

01:51:49.826 --> 01:51:52.659
See, that was a very, very quick team.

01:51:52.728 --> 01:51:57.927
And I played the guys
that I felt we could win with.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.731
We ran out there.
And what I saw was wall-to-wall people.

01:52:03.139 --> 01:52:06.870
The reporter was white.
The cheerleaders was white.

01:52:06.943 --> 01:52:09.707
The referee was white.
The camera people was white.

01:52:09.779 --> 01:52:15.240
It was an atmosphere that could have been
real hostile for us if we allowed it to be.

01:52:15.318 --> 01:52:21.814
I feel that this game was probably
the Emancipation Proclamation of 1966.

01:52:21.891 --> 01:52:27.386
And it wasn't until history started to talk
about this game, you know, in that context,

01:52:27.463 --> 01:52:30.455
that we realized we were part
of something that was bigger

01:52:30.533 --> 01:52:32.694
than just five blacks and five whites.

01:52:32.768 --> 01:52:37.102
Black ballplayers were thought of
as inferior.

01:52:37.173 --> 01:52:42.941
You know, can't work under pressure. You
know, rip 'em a little bit, and they'll fold.

01:52:43.012 --> 01:52:47.540
That was the way that a white person
was thinking back then,

01:52:47.617 --> 01:52:51.075
that we couldn't compete
with the white players.

01:52:51.154 --> 01:52:54.317
We experienced a lot of racism
during that season.

01:52:54.390 --> 01:53:01.728
People would spit at you,
and fans would call us niggers, coons...

01:53:02.965 --> 01:53:08.096
And the world looked at it
in that perspective -

01:53:08.171 --> 01:53:12.437
the white team verses this black team.
For us.

01:53:12.508 --> 01:53:15.534
We were playing for much more
than what they were playing for.

01:53:15.611 --> 01:53:18.546
They were playing
for just another championship.

01:53:18.614 --> 01:53:22.948
We were playing to prove that it doesn't
make any difference what color you were -

01:53:23.019 --> 01:53:27.718
if you're given the opportunity,
you could do anything.

01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:31.749
If I could turn back the hands of time,

01:53:31.827 --> 01:53:38.596
I would have love to have gone over
to the Kentucky players

01:53:38.668 --> 01:53:40.795
and shaken their hands.

01:53:40.870 --> 01:53:43.805
Not to patronize them, you know?

01:53:43.873 --> 01:53:47.809
And not to say,
"Thank you for giving me an opportunity."

01:53:47.877 --> 01:53:51.369
You didn't give us this opportunity.
We earned this, see.

01:53:51.447 --> 01:53:56.475
I'm proud to be part of this portrayal
of a great, great man in Don Haskins

01:53:56.552 --> 01:54:01.080
and, you know, players
who simply cared about being great

01:54:01.157 --> 01:54:04.422
and wanting to separate themselves
from the pack

01:54:04.493 --> 01:54:09.089
and wanting to do something unique.

01:54:09.165 --> 01:54:13.261
And to leave footprints in the sand.
They've done that, man.

01:54:13.336 --> 01:54:15.463
They've done that.

01:55:29.812 --> 01:55:33.213
(# "I Will Make the Darkness Light"
