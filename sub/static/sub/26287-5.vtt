02:41.662 --> 02:43.030
Oh, it's nothing fancy.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.132
You know, it's some baked eggs
with chorizo

02:45.132 --> 02:46.833
in a fire-roasted tomato ragout.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.635
Mmm.
Maybe it's a little fancy.

02:48.635 --> 02:49.736
Come here.

02:58.278 --> 03:00.313
Morning, guys.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.683
Ooh, I smell chorizo.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.820
Cole, Maya doesn't leave for
school for another 30 minutes.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.622
Ooh, that looks delicious.
I know, I know.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.625
I just wanted to come early and
bring you your birthday gift.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.227
Wow.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.763
You really didn't
have to do this.

03:16.763 --> 03:19.232
When Nat and I first met...
He doesn't want
to hear this.

03:19.232 --> 03:22.135
No, it's fine.
I-I do. Go on.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.171
Well, Nat was treating me
in a medical tent in Kashmir,

03:24.171 --> 03:26.306
and she kept complaining
about the shampoo.

03:26.306 --> 03:30.310
So I used my CIA connections to
get her some alshier alsihariu,

03:30.310 --> 03:33.713
which is Arabic
for "Magic Hair."

03:33.713 --> 03:35.248
Hmm.

03:35.248 --> 03:38.885
He can tell a story.
I'm gonna get Maya ready.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.888
Mm.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.624
He's such a sweetheart.
What are you doing?

03:44.624 --> 03:47.727
What? Me bringing you shampoo
on your birthday is our thing.
No, Cole,

03:47.727 --> 03:49.096
there is no thing.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.730
I have a serious boyfriend,

03:50.730 --> 03:52.799
who already feels
uncomfortable around you.

03:52.799 --> 03:53.900
What do you mean?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.136
He's got it in his head

03:56.136 --> 03:59.005
that you're this real-life
action hero

03:59.005 --> 04:00.674
that I had this torrid
love affair with.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.276
Which is ridiculous.
Yes, but kinda flattering.

04:03.276 --> 04:06.379
Listen to me. I really
like this guy, okay?

04:06.379 --> 04:07.914
Please don't mess it up.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.082
Andrew and I just need
to rap a little bit

04:09.082 --> 04:10.350
and get to know each other.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.152
Okay? I'll just
swing by the hospital later.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.186
Do not.

04:13.186 --> 04:16.323
It never ends well
when you try to fix things.

04:16.323 --> 04:17.924
Which is why I'm due.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.926
I'm kidding.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.428
Wait for Maya
in the car, please.

04:21.428 --> 04:25.665
Sure, but if you're not going
to use the Magic Hair...

04:25.665 --> 04:28.168
Thank you.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.906
Are you guys gonna
eat all that?
Cole.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.674
See you later.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.213
RIANA:
Please, Mom.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.282
TRISH:
The answer is no, Riana.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.850
RIANA:
You're being so unfair.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.218
TRISH:
How am I being unfair?

04:45.218 --> 04:47.187
RIANA:
'Cause you're not
listening to me.

04:47.187 --> 04:50.957
TRISH:
I'm listening, you just
don't like the response.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.462
No need to knock.
Thank you.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.264
RIANA:
No, you haven't.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.466
TRISH:
Well, then you're the one
who's not listening.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.967
RIANA:
Ugh! You're the one

05:00.967 --> 05:02.802
who's not listening.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.671
I hate it here.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.877
What's that?

05:10.877 --> 05:13.046
Hey, baby, what's-what's
going on with you

05:13.046 --> 05:14.314
and your mother
up there?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.049
Why did you order
a bilge pump?

05:16.049 --> 05:17.751
I thought you got rid
of your boat.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.819
Well, that's a...

05:19.819 --> 05:22.489
an interesting story...
Oh, my God, you
still have it.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.090
Shh! Shh!

05:24.090 --> 05:26.359
Mom is going to freak.
No, she's not,

05:26.359 --> 05:28.028
because you're not going
to say anything.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.263
Really?

05:30.263 --> 05:32.098
Riana...

05:32.098 --> 05:34.501
not another word
about that concert.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.770
Oh, but you haven't
even asked Dad.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.505
Oh, well there is no need.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.973
We are on the same page.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.775
You'd be surprised.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.044
Riana wants to go see Migos

05:44.044 --> 05:45.946
in concert
this Thursday,

05:45.946 --> 05:47.280
even though she has school
the next day.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.016
And so do my friends,
but they're all going.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.117
And your point is?

05:51.117 --> 05:52.285
I'm just pointing out that

05:52.285 --> 05:53.853
we're all in the same boat.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.755
Right, Dad?

05:59.025 --> 06:01.928
Well, a-actually, honey,
uh, Riana makes a point.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.363
Maybe we can just, uh,

06:03.363 --> 06:04.898
make an exception this one time.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.033
Yes! Thank you so much.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.769
Oh, you're messing with fire.

06:09.769 --> 06:11.071
Thank you.

06:11.071 --> 06:14.808
That-that kid, you know.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.977
Look, I know you may think

06:16.977 --> 06:19.079
that I undercut your authority,

06:19.079 --> 06:21.047
but it's just this one time.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.917
And i-if I reverse my decision,

06:23.917 --> 06:26.086
then I undercut
my own authority.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.288
You see the conflict?

06:29.789 --> 06:31.091
Which is what I'm gonna do,

06:31.091 --> 06:33.793
because I was wrong

06:33.793 --> 06:35.362
in the first place.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.931
Exactly.
Tell her soon.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.332
Yes, ma'am.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.537
You try and set an example
for your kids,

06:44.537 --> 06:46.806
and they turn around
and try to blackmail you.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.942
How's lying about having a boat
setting a good example?

06:48.942 --> 06:52.145
Do you think I really want
to be challenged right now?

06:52.145 --> 06:53.813
Okay, well, if it makes
you feel any better,

06:53.813 --> 06:56.149
my ex just told me that I make
her boyfriend uncomfortable.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.051
I think he's worried
that I'm still into her.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.520
Are you?
No.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.554
Why do you ask?

07:01.554 --> 07:05.091
I don't know, I... you're always
talking about her.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.961
And I've never heard you
hit on another woman.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.130
Well, maybe I haven't
met one worth hitting on.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.832
Or you don't have game.

07:14.934 --> 07:15.935
I have plenty of game.

07:15.935 --> 07:16.936
What do you think, Bailey?

07:18.038 --> 07:19.873
I'm sorry. Cole with game?

07:19.873 --> 07:21.841
I don't know. I've never
seen him hit on anyone.
What?

07:21.841 --> 07:23.143
Right? Exactly.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.844
Info on the
hijacked truck.

07:24.844 --> 07:26.246
The crew swapped the cabs

07:26.246 --> 07:28.982
because the original one
had a tracking system in it.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.251
Detective Murtaugh and Cole,

07:31.251 --> 07:32.986
this is Lena Bechara.
She works

07:32.986 --> 07:35.588
for the owner of the art that
was stolen, Victor Halderman.

07:35.588 --> 07:38.191
Nice to meet you.
COLE:
You studied in England,

07:38.191 --> 07:40.126
but you grew up in Jordan.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.528
No. Lebanon.

07:41.528 --> 07:42.629
I beg your pardon?

07:42.629 --> 07:44.130
I like
to guess people's accents.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.598
I kind of have an ear for it.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.567
Well, I suggest
you get it checked,

07:47.567 --> 07:49.035
because you're wrong
on all fronts.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.870
Are these two my only option?

07:50.870 --> 07:54.007
Trust me, Ms. Bechara,
you're in very good hands.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.142
I'll believe that when
we get our art back, officer.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.879
Here's a list
of the items on board.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.583
I'm sorry
about the accent comment.

08:03.583 --> 08:07.153
I, uh, just spent some
time in those countries.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.955
With the military?

08:08.955 --> 08:10.990
More or less.
I see.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.093
Well, I hope
you're as good at finding things

08:13.093 --> 08:15.195
as you are at destroying them.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.901
No game.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.903
Nope.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.307
♪ ♪

08:32.178 --> 08:34.481
What's the chief
doing here?

08:34.481 --> 08:36.483
Victor Halderman must have
friends in high places.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.185
The art needs to be returned

08:39.185 --> 08:40.620
in one piece,
is that clear?

08:40.620 --> 08:43.556
Don't worry. My officers
are always cautious.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.992
Are you and Cole not
on the case anymore?

08:45.992 --> 08:48.328
You've been very snarky lately.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.929
Halderman is
sailing back

08:49.929 --> 08:52.332
from Central America and
should be in L.A. by 4:00.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.334
I'd love to have
some positive news for him.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.036
Absolutely. We're on it.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.437
Thanks, Captain Ainsley.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.611
These cases...
That's right.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.713
Apparently, the chief
does not know my name,

09:06.713 --> 09:07.647
and do you know why?

09:07.647 --> 09:10.250
Because you haven't given him
reason to.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.719
That's why we need wins,
starting now.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.155
So what do we know
about this case?

09:15.155 --> 09:17.090
Relax, Cap.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.658
We ran the background
on the two dead crew members.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.360
Both of them did
minor jail time.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.996
Also, large traces
of titanium dioxide--

09:22.996 --> 09:25.031
a chemical used to make paint--
was found on their clothing.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.133
What about the driver?
Well, he's in critical

09:27.133 --> 09:28.401
but stable condition.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.537
Cole volunteered
to go question him.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.005
Good. Well,
let's keep digging.
Yes.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.406
Let's find that truck.
I want a win.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.276
You got it, Ainsley.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.279
Too soon, Bailey.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.116
Her snarkiness--

09:43.116 --> 09:44.350
off the charts.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.157
MAN:
Then I turned

09:51.157 --> 09:52.559
and he fired.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.294
Got it.

09:54.294 --> 09:57.030
Is there anything else you
can tell us about these guys?

09:58.998 --> 10:01.301
I remember hearing
the name Gatanas.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.037
Gatanas.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.309
I'm sorry. With a... with a G?

10:09.309 --> 10:11.277
As in Gwen Stefani?

10:11.277 --> 10:13.680
Sure.
Yeah, great.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.216
Anything else
Keep thinking about it.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.017
I'll be back.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.686
BAILEY: What's up?

10:19.686 --> 10:21.354
He overheard the name Gatanas.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.224
Hold on. That sounds familiar.

10:24.224 --> 10:28.027
Yes. One of the truck hijackers
was a former cellmate

10:28.027 --> 10:29.362
with a Petros Gatanas.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.464
Great. Try to get an address.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.338
Hey, Andrew.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.173
Cole.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.641
What are you doing here?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.476
I was just in the area,
and I was just wondering

10:43.476 --> 10:45.078
if it was a good time to chat?

10:45.078 --> 10:47.714
Um, Cole, I'm at work,
and we're in an elevator.

10:47.714 --> 10:50.083
Don't worry. Just take a minute.

10:54.053 --> 10:56.356
Cole, y-you're making me
a little nervous.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.392
Exactly.
Hence the reason for my visit.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.295
Andy, we need to get more
comfortable around each other.

11:02.295 --> 11:05.431
Agreed. Uh, maybe we can start
by pushing that button.
Sure,

11:05.431 --> 11:08.101
sure, after we rap a bit.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.437
So...

11:11.437 --> 11:13.506
Game of Thrones.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.508
How cool is that show?

11:15.508 --> 11:18.411
Cole, I really don't do well
in closed spaces.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.387
Oh, ow.
Man.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.856
Cole, did you just head butt me?
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.091
It was an accident.
I was reaching for this...

11:33.393 --> 11:34.494
...engagement ring?

11:40.366 --> 11:42.869
It's gorgeous, by the way.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.071
Princess cut?

11:47.707 --> 11:50.810
MURTAUGH:
So you went to fix the problem
and ended up

11:50.810 --> 11:53.780
making it worse.
Natalie calls it
"pulling a Cole."

11:53.780 --> 11:56.749
Yeah, well...

11:56.749 --> 11:59.352
I'm sorry about the ring.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.287
That's tough.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.822
Why? I'm totally happy for them.

12:02.822 --> 12:04.891
Over the moon, in fact.
:
Yeah.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.894
I can tell by the giant
vein bulging in your neck.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.629
You're totally
at peace with it.

12:13.199 --> 12:16.769
So, we're supposed to just drive
around looking for Gatanas?

12:16.769 --> 12:19.405
Bailey said that he's somewhere
in the Warehouse District

12:19.405 --> 12:23.209
based on her triangulation
business that she does.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.845
Did she say that there was
chemicals used to make paint

12:25.845 --> 12:28.381
on the two crew members
who were shot during the heist?

12:28.381 --> 12:30.583
Yeah, why?

12:38.891 --> 12:40.493
MAN:
Two of my men got killed, okay?

12:40.493 --> 12:42.228
You paid us
to get you your art,

12:42.228 --> 12:43.496
and we got it.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.232
Now, I want my damn...

12:46.232 --> 12:47.834
Okay, someone hired him.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.669
MAN: You hear me?
No. H-Hold on.

12:49.669 --> 12:50.903
If there's a firefight,
paint thinner

12:50.903 --> 12:52.405
in those tanks
could blow up

12:52.405 --> 12:53.873
the whole collection.
I don't care

12:53.873 --> 12:55.575
about no collection.
What about us?

12:55.575 --> 12:57.377
Exactly, it's a lose-lose.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.945
So, then, what's your plan?

12:58.945 --> 13:01.247
Okay, here's the plan. I'm gonna
go in there and draw him away

13:01.247 --> 13:03.650
from his gun. You go in
when I give you the signal.

13:03.650 --> 13:04.884
Okay, which is what?

13:04.884 --> 13:06.252
You'll know when you see it.

13:06.252 --> 13:07.353
No, I want to know now.

13:07.353 --> 13:08.521
You'll know. You'll know.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.690
Tell me, tell me,
tell me. No, no.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.526
Excuse me.

13:13.526 --> 13:17.230
Hi. I, uh, I'm on my
way to the Laker game,

13:17.230 --> 13:20.633
and I would love to paint
my entire body gold first.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.269
I was wondering if you could
help me out with that.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.471
Swish.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.639
Okay, is that the signal?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.274
We're not open.

13:28.274 --> 13:30.677
COLE:
Aw.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.412
That is so disappointing.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.713
You sure you can't, uh,

13:33.713 --> 13:36.315
slip me a gallon on the QT?
Is that it?

13:36.315 --> 13:37.950
Purple also works.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.952
That's not it.
I mean, if I show up like this,

13:39.952 --> 13:42.288
I'm gonna look like an idiot.
You know what I'm talking about.

13:42.288 --> 13:45.258
Right

13:45.258 --> 13:47.326
Oh, that's it.
No, that's not it.

13:48.294 --> 13:49.696
Roger. Roger.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.702
LAPD, put it down!

13:59.439 --> 14:01.007
COLE:
Roger, the art!

14:01.007 --> 14:02.809
MURTAUGH:
I'm working on it.

14:49.889 --> 14:50.990
Oops.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.727
Okay.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.365
Yeah, so, we messed up
a few paintings, but overall,

14:59.365 --> 15:01.701
not that bad.
Who says we don't get wins?

15:06.773 --> 15:09.776
Avery's gonna be pissed.
Big-time.

15:12.044 --> 15:15.348
Oh, this is a classic:
fire damage and bullet holes.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.717
What the hell happened?
We had a communication issue.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.419
If you wanted the signal
to be a fist,

15:20.419 --> 15:21.554
you should have said that.

15:21.554 --> 15:22.789
I thought it was pretty obvious.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.358
MURTAUGH:
No, a loud whistle is obvious.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.327
Or even a "ca-caw, ca-caw"
is obvious.

15:28.327 --> 15:29.796
But a fist...

15:29.796 --> 15:31.798
I don't know what that is.
What is this, Captain?

15:31.798 --> 15:33.466
COLE:
I actually don't "ca-caw."

15:33.466 --> 15:34.534
For personal reasons.

15:35.535 --> 15:36.869
Congratulations.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.538
I heard your shock
and awe campaign

15:38.538 --> 15:40.072
against our art was a success.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.408
I'm sorry, and you are?
This is Lena Bechara.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.043
She works for Victor Halderman.
AVERY:
Right, of course.

15:44.043 --> 15:46.579
We are so sorry.
Please assure Mr. Halderman

15:46.579 --> 15:47.780
we'll catch
the person responsible.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.550
I'm sorry, will catch?

15:50.550 --> 15:51.784
So you neither
protected the art

15:51.784 --> 15:53.452
nor caught the person
that stole it?

15:53.452 --> 15:54.687
Did I get that right, Captain?

15:54.687 --> 15:55.922
Ainsley.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.523
Where are the pieces now?

15:57.523 --> 15:59.091
I want to see them immediately.
Right. I'm sure

15:59.091 --> 16:00.860
one of these officers
will happily take you.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.995
Detective Cole?
He just made a fist.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.096
He's...

16:04.096 --> 16:05.464
Officer Cole.

16:05.464 --> 16:10.469
I don't think I made a fist.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.472
Don't worry, Captain.
We're gonna get this fixed.
I hope so,

16:13.472 --> 16:17.443
because I am so tired of not
getting any respect around here.

16:17.443 --> 16:20.513
RIANA: What's up, Dad?
MURTAUGH: Hey.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.981
You-you remember when I said

16:21.981 --> 16:23.749
that you could
go to that concert?

16:23.749 --> 16:25.551
Well...

16:25.551 --> 16:26.786
what I had meant...

16:26.786 --> 16:28.387
I hope you're not
changing your mind,

16:28.387 --> 16:31.123
because it would be unwise
to rock the boat

16:31.123 --> 16:33.726
at this point,
if you know what I'm saying.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.562
I know exactly
what you're saying.

16:36.562 --> 16:39.732
And do you think you're gonna
get away with this, young lady?

16:39.732 --> 16:42.068
I could ask you
the same question.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.905
Okay.

16:45.905 --> 16:48.975
Maybe there's an arrangement
that can be made.

16:48.975 --> 16:52.645
What if I bought
all the Mugo albums?

16:52.645 --> 16:55.514
It's Migos, and nice try.

16:55.514 --> 16:59.051
I want tickets to see them
this Saturday in San Diego.

16:59.051 --> 17:00.887
Fine.

17:00.887 --> 17:03.589
For me and five friends.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.924
Are you kidding me?

17:04.924 --> 17:06.559
And they'd have to be

17:06.559 --> 17:07.627
great seats.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.662
General admission.
Floor.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.696
Upper level.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.131
Floor.

17:12.999 --> 17:15.768
You know that this is extortion.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.003
I can have you arrested.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.871
You know that?
Thanks, Daddy. Love you.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.473
MURTAUGH: You don't...

17:20.473 --> 17:22.942
...me. Love doesn't
hurt their d... Hello?

17:22.942 --> 17:24.944
What's she got on you?
You know what,

17:24.944 --> 17:26.946
Bailey,
this is a snark-free zone.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.915
Let's keep it that way.
Fine.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.950
But it turns out
Gatanas was paid

17:30.950 --> 17:33.552
from an offshore account
the day before the robbery.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.655
I traced the IP address,
and guess what it's linked to?

17:35.655 --> 17:37.223
Halderman's gallery.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.693
So Halderman robbed himself
so he can collect the insurance.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.495
Okay.

17:42.495 --> 17:45.898
Maybe it's time to pay him
a visit down at the marina.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.709
Hey, can I give you a hand?

17:56.709 --> 18:00.980
Thanks, but the goal is
to not destroy any more artwork.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.691
Where is that?

18:11.691 --> 18:12.992
Anfeh Beach.

18:12.992 --> 18:15.728
My mother used
to take me there as a child.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.596
In Lebanon's Koura District.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.864
I've been there.

18:18.864 --> 18:20.833
You've been to Anfeh?

18:20.833 --> 18:24.837
Yeah, long time ago.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.640
You are from Lebanon.
You lied to me.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.843
I just didn't feel like being
hit on at a police station.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.012
I wasn't hitting on you, okay?

18:33.012 --> 18:34.914
I just have an ear for accents.

18:34.914 --> 18:38.084
Fine. My apologies.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.786
Anfeh's gorgeous, by the way.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.555
It's very romantic.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.825
Well, next time you
should bring someone.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.293
I did, actually.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.863
We're not together anymore.
She's getting proposed to.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.999
An anesthesiologist.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.167
I'm over the moon about it.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.740
I'm afraid
I misjudged you, Cole.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.809
You'd be crazy not to.
And if it makes you
feel any better,

19:03.809 --> 19:05.644
no woman's excited
to marry someone

19:05.644 --> 19:07.079
who puts people to sleep
for a living.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.882
I've never had that problem.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.184
I bet you haven't.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.029
MURTAUGH:
Mr. Halderman.

19:23.029 --> 19:26.065
LAPD. Like to ask you
a few questions.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.666
Uh
About what--

19:27.666 --> 19:29.568
the millions your department
just torched?

19:29.568 --> 19:31.771
Come with us downtown,
and we'll explain.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.106
Oh, I prefer to stay
on my giant yacht,

19:34.106 --> 19:36.909
but, uh, thanks.
Suit yourself.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.844
We know that you're
committing fraud.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.179
Oh, fraud?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.581
Oh.
Sounds more illegal
when he says it.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.183
And how exactly
have I been doing that?

19:44.183 --> 19:47.053
Your gallery wired money
to the man responsible

19:47.053 --> 19:48.754
for the theft of your art
two days ago.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.122
Uh-huh.
I believe this is

19:50.122 --> 19:52.058
your signature on
the approval form?

20:01.767 --> 20:03.002
Not even close.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.870
And two days ago
I was in Panama,

20:04.870 --> 20:06.205
scouting artifacts.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.107
Does anybody else
have access to that account?

20:08.107 --> 20:11.577
Yeah. One person.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.181
COLE:
I mean, I do have to confess,

20:15.181 --> 20:16.949
I might have been flirting
with you this morning,

20:16.949 --> 20:18.217
like, a little bit.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.886
I have a confession, too.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.555
I kind of liked it.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.159
Sorry, it's my partner.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.129
What's up?

20:30.129 --> 20:32.631
Are you with Lena?
Yeah, and she's

20:32.631 --> 20:34.100
loving me, okay?

20:34.100 --> 20:36.135
Who's got game now, buddy?
This guy.

20:36.135 --> 20:39.038
She's the one who hired Gatanas.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.173
Arrest her.
What?

20:44.877 --> 20:46.312
Sorry, Cole.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.216
Murtaugh.

21:25.417 --> 21:26.685
Hang on.

21:44.203 --> 21:46.138
Hey, you okay?

21:46.138 --> 21:48.140
Never better.

22:04.223 --> 22:07.393
Huh. I guess she's
the one that got away.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.966
To recap, you guys destroyed
most of Halderman's art,

22:13.966 --> 22:15.801
falsely accused him of fraud
and let the real thief escape.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.403
I'd worry you were trying
to destroy my good name,

22:17.403 --> 22:19.138
but luckily,
the chief doesn't know it.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.242
So, what do we know
about this Lena?

22:23.242 --> 22:26.145
Uh, not much,
because it's not her name.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.080
Lena Bechara died
a year ago at 80.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.082
It was a phony identity.
Great. So we've got nothing.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.917
Well, we know that
she's originally from Lebanon,

22:31.917 --> 22:33.953
and that she has an
emotional tie to the painting.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.322
If we learn more about it, then
we'll learn more about her.

22:36.322 --> 22:38.224
Sure, run with it.

22:38.224 --> 22:40.459
Oh.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.862
That's Trish.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.799
Look, I'm still
not convinced that

22:46.799 --> 22:49.768
Halderman's hands are
clean in all of this.

22:49.768 --> 22:51.403
Yeah, Trish.

22:51.403 --> 22:53.839
Oh, yeah,
he's right here.

22:53.839 --> 22:56.175
I don't know
why he didn't answer.

22:57.977 --> 23:01.814
: I know that you're
frustrated, but this is petty.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.082
Answer the phone.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.451
Hey, Trishy.

23:05.451 --> 23:09.822
Uh, yes. N-No.
I'm in a bad area.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.190
I-I know. I'm in

23:11.190 --> 23:13.192
the captain's...
but I'm under a beam.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.261
Okay, I'll be right there.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.405
Roger.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.107
Good evening.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.409
Did you buy

23:30.409 --> 23:34.280
$1,500 worth of tickets

23:34.280 --> 23:37.950
to see Migos this Saturday
in San Diego?

23:37.950 --> 23:39.451
Uh... yes,

23:39.451 --> 23:43.289
because they
are terrific,

23:43.289 --> 23:44.990
and I figured
it would be fun

23:44.990 --> 23:48.127
if you and I went and
just made a weekend of it.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.529
Roger, what's going on?

23:52.464 --> 23:54.900
Okay, you want the truth?
I do.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.402
The truth is that...

23:56.402 --> 23:58.137
Dad still has his boat.
Wait.

23:58.137 --> 24:00.372
What Roger.

24:00.372 --> 24:01.540
Okay, it's true,

24:01.540 --> 24:04.276
and she used that information

24:04.276 --> 24:06.345
to blackmail me.

24:06.345 --> 24:07.579
TRISH:
To wh...?
Mm-hmm.

24:07.579 --> 24:09.148
Riana.
Get on her.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.016
Okay, okay.

24:11.016 --> 24:14.520
Let's deal with one awful
decision at a time, shall we?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.355
Go.

24:16.355 --> 24:18.557
Why don't we deal
with hers first?

24:19.958 --> 24:21.327
Okay, look,

24:21.327 --> 24:23.262
I just couldn't
get rid of her.

24:23.262 --> 24:26.098
I mean, Lucille
is my sanctuary.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.399
Sanctuary from what?

24:27.399 --> 24:28.934
From all of this.

24:28.934 --> 24:30.302
I mean, sometimes,
all I get

24:30.302 --> 24:31.904
is grief from you people.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.272
You people?

24:33.272 --> 24:34.440
You Murtaugh people.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.175
The Murts.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.477
Listen, Lulu

24:38.477 --> 24:43.449
is one of the few places
where I can go and be alone.

24:43.449 --> 24:46.318
Well, maybe now's a good time
to pay her a visit.

24:52.124 --> 24:55.227
So, um, if you aren't
gonna use those tickets...

24:55.227 --> 24:57.429
Uh.
I'll be upstairs.

25:04.636 --> 25:07.239
COLE:
Thanks for staying late, Bailey.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.007
Oh, please.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.443
Once I take an airbag
to the face, I'm all in.

25:12.244 --> 25:13.479
Wait. There. That's it.

25:13.479 --> 25:16.382
Shati Bahr by Aleah Khudari.

25:16.382 --> 25:19.485
What can we learn about her?

25:22.621 --> 25:24.857
What exactly are
we looking for?

25:26.558 --> 25:28.627
That one.

25:28.627 --> 25:31.397
This is an obituary from 2000.

25:31.397 --> 25:33.065
"Aleah Khudari,
a prominent

25:33.065 --> 25:35.367
"local artist, was killed
during a rebel attack

25:35.367 --> 25:37.202
"near her home in Tripoli.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.938
She's survived by her daughter
Layla, age ten."

25:39.938 --> 25:41.640
So today, Layla
would be...

25:41.640 --> 25:44.977
28. Let's see
if she has a passport.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.945
Layla Khudari.

25:47.946 --> 25:50.682
Layla Khudari.

25:50.682 --> 25:53.685
Find out if she's booked
on any international flights.

25:53.685 --> 25:55.554
Where do you think
she's going?

25:55.554 --> 25:57.189
Well, my guess is now
that she's got the painting

25:57.189 --> 25:59.525
from Halderman, she
wants to take it home.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.414
COLE:
Who would have thought
running from the cops

26:22.414 --> 26:24.450
on a racing bike
could be so dangerous?

26:29.588 --> 26:31.590
Drop the gun, Layla.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.295
You need to go to the hospital.
I need to go home.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.470
No one was supposed to die
in that robbery.

26:45.504 --> 26:47.673
I just wanted
what belonged to me.

26:49.007 --> 26:50.175
I believe you.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.412
I know all about
your mother's painting,

26:53.412 --> 26:55.314
but you have to drop the gun.

26:57.616 --> 27:02.187
I won't take you to a hospital,
but I can get you help.

27:02.187 --> 27:04.189
But you got to trust me.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.626
Do you trust me?

27:16.168 --> 27:18.537
I was in the middle
of my birthday dinner.

27:18.537 --> 27:19.705
This better be
an emergency.

27:19.705 --> 27:22.074
She needs your help.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.517
Okay, all done.
Thank you.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.519
You should try to
get some sleep.

27:33.519 --> 27:36.755
Here you go.

27:41.793 --> 27:43.695
Do you have a minute?

27:43.695 --> 27:44.730
She has a bad wound.

27:45.731 --> 27:48.100
Possibly a broken rib.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.135
You should get her
to a hospital for X-rays.

27:50.135 --> 27:52.871
I will. Thank you so much.

27:52.871 --> 27:54.506
Cole, what is going on?

27:54.506 --> 27:57.809
Did you just tag me into
a really weird first date?

27:57.809 --> 28:01.947
No, that-that's not what's
happening, okay? Trust me.

28:01.947 --> 28:03.582
Then what is it?

28:03.582 --> 28:05.884
Is she like an international
art thief or something?

28:05.884 --> 28:08.053
:
Yeah, right.

28:08.053 --> 28:10.155
Tell me what's going on.

28:10.155 --> 28:12.791
You've interrupted my birthday
twice now.

28:12.791 --> 28:14.993
I can't.

28:14.993 --> 28:16.995
You can't.

28:16.995 --> 28:18.797
Of course you can't.

28:18.797 --> 28:20.799
Our entire relationship

28:20.799 --> 28:22.768
was built on
that phrase.

28:22.768 --> 28:24.403
You should put it
on your tombstone.

28:28.574 --> 28:29.875
Nat.

28:31.443 --> 28:32.644
I'm just trying to protect you.

28:35.781 --> 28:40.052
That's the woman you went
to Anfeh Beach with, right?

28:51.663 --> 28:52.864
Who's there?

28:52.864 --> 28:55.100
Whoa. Relax.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.868
I've been calling
you all morning.

28:56.868 --> 28:58.904
Did you sleep here?

28:58.904 --> 29:00.205
It's actually
quite comfortable.

29:00.205 --> 29:02.674
Is it? It doesn't
look comfortable.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.943
Can I help you with something?

29:04.943 --> 29:07.112
We were right
about Halderman.

29:07.112 --> 29:08.947
The gallery in Colombia
that he was shipping to

29:08.947 --> 29:12.217
is actually a shell corp set up
by people who are associated

29:12.217 --> 29:14.086
with a Colombian guerrilla group
called BACRIM.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.122
Doesn't sound like art
aficionados. Where's Cole?

29:17.122 --> 29:19.558
I don't know.
He won't answer, either.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.228
COLE:
So,

29:23.228 --> 29:25.263
last night you mentioned
Halderman was responsible

29:25.263 --> 29:27.566
for your mother's death.
How so?

29:29.534 --> 29:32.237
He was doing business with
the rebel group that killed her.

29:32.237 --> 29:34.039
Whoa.
And her painting

29:34.039 --> 29:35.140
ended up in his possession.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.975
What would you think?

29:42.247 --> 29:44.750
I'm sorry.
One minute. Roger.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.518
I've got an update.
MURTAUGH:
Me, too.

29:46.518 --> 29:49.888
Halderman's last art shipment
was going to BACRIM.

29:49.888 --> 29:51.857
BACRIM?
The Colombian gang?

29:51.857 --> 29:52.991
MURTAUGH:
No,

29:52.991 --> 29:54.026
as in the boy band.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.994
Yes, the gang.

29:55.994 --> 29:57.162
Who are you talking to?

29:57.162 --> 29:58.530
Is that Lena?

29:58.530 --> 29:59.898
Don't worry.
She's not going anywhere.

29:59.898 --> 30:01.166
Halderman's
whole business

30:01.166 --> 30:03.001
is dealing with
rogue military groups.

30:03.001 --> 30:04.603
What's he providing them?

30:04.603 --> 30:07.305
I'm not exactly sure,
but it's expensive.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.808
BACRIM paid him ten million
for that art

30:09.808 --> 30:11.643
even though it's worth
no more than two.

30:11.643 --> 30:12.944
I can't hear you.

30:12.944 --> 30:14.179
Put us on speaker phone.

30:36.568 --> 30:39.337
I think I just figured out what
Halderman is really selling.

30:39.337 --> 30:41.206
MAN:
Where are my chips?!

30:41.206 --> 30:43.008
Relax. Relax.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.711
We paid you a lot
of money for them.
All right, relax.

30:45.711 --> 30:47.179
Relax, man. Relax.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.214
Come on, they're all
in tubes at LAPD, you know?

30:49.214 --> 30:51.349
I'm-I'm confident
I'll get 'em back soon.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.652
One, however, was taken, but

30:53.652 --> 30:55.353
the second
that this is activated,

30:55.353 --> 30:58.123
we're gonna know precisely
where it is. There.

30:58.990 --> 31:00.659
Huh?

31:00.659 --> 31:02.360
Yeah.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.695
Yeah. See?

31:19.311 --> 31:20.979
LAYLA:
What did you find?

31:20.979 --> 31:23.315
This is a plan for an RDD.

31:23.315 --> 31:26.318
These animals are trying
to build a dirty bomb.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.886
Roger?

31:31.223 --> 31:33.358
If you guys wouldn't mind
removing your shoes

31:33.358 --> 31:35.861
before entering,
I'd really appreciate it.

31:39.164 --> 31:41.700
Looks like Cole was right.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.136
All of these tubes
have chips in them.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.337
That's him now.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.706
Hey. Where the hell
have you been?

31:47.706 --> 31:49.841
We got the rest of the chips.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.276
Yeah, about that, Roger.

31:51.276 --> 31:54.346
I got a new friend
who wants to talk to you.

31:58.183 --> 32:00.819
I believe you have my paintings.

32:00.819 --> 32:03.088
Who the hell is this?

32:03.088 --> 32:04.656
And what are you doing
with my partner?

32:04.656 --> 32:06.725
I want you to deliver them
to me within the hour,

32:06.725 --> 32:08.927
on the water
so we know you're alone.

32:08.927 --> 32:12.097
If not, we will chop up him
and his friend

32:12.097 --> 32:14.266
and feed them to the sharks.

32:16.034 --> 32:17.335
Sharks don't feed until dusk,

32:17.335 --> 32:20.238
so... we have
at least four hours.

32:20.238 --> 32:22.007
Granted, that's not
quality time.

32:22.007 --> 32:24.309
Do you always joke
when your life's in danger?

32:24.309 --> 32:26.812
That's how I cope.

32:26.812 --> 32:28.213
Please stop coping.

32:28.213 --> 32:30.282
Don't worry.
My partner's on his way.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.417
He knows exactly what to do.

32:34.252 --> 32:35.921
You're in neutral.

32:35.921 --> 32:37.322
Wait, wait, wait.

32:37.322 --> 32:39.124
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wrong direction!

32:39.124 --> 32:41.459
Wrong direction! Go back!
Back, back, back, back, back!

32:41.459 --> 32:43.395
Have you ever driven
this thing before?

32:43.395 --> 32:45.997
I'm not even
supposed to have it.

32:45.997 --> 32:49.067
Okay, maybe we
should call Avery.
No.

32:49.067 --> 32:50.368
I got to go this alone.

32:50.368 --> 32:53.872
Besides, I got this.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.308
Whoa...

32:56.308 --> 32:57.709
Murtaugh...

32:57.709 --> 33:01.279
Murtaugh, do you know
what you're doing?

33:12.257 --> 33:14.492
Stay out of sight.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.361
And be ready to drive off

33:16.361 --> 33:18.029
if things go south.

33:18.029 --> 33:19.831
Good luck. And thank you.

33:19.831 --> 33:20.966
For what?

33:20.966 --> 33:22.467
The fresh air.

33:22.467 --> 33:24.336
Ahoy there, Cap'n.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.422
Did you bring them?

33:50.262 --> 33:51.429
Watch out! Watch out!

33:56.034 --> 33:57.869
What was that?

34:00.906 --> 34:02.707
We're taking on water.

34:06.444 --> 34:08.780
MAN:
Give me the chips!

34:34.339 --> 34:36.074
Help!

34:45.016 --> 34:46.484
Cole.

34:46.484 --> 34:48.486
Cole...
No!

34:49.587 --> 34:51.923
No!

35:26.157 --> 35:28.126
Bailey! Go!

35:47.912 --> 35:50.015
♪ ♪

36:14.506 --> 36:16.574
You see?
A fist is the perfect signal.

36:16.574 --> 36:19.044
BAILEY:
Uh, guys?

36:19.044 --> 36:21.513
The bullets ripped a
hole through the boat.

36:21.513 --> 36:22.580
We're going down.

36:22.580 --> 36:25.050
My first and last voyage.

36:25.050 --> 36:26.584
We need a plan.

36:26.584 --> 36:28.219
You got a bilge pump?

36:29.454 --> 36:32.290
This great city
trusts you to keep it safe,

36:32.290 --> 36:33.692
and today you more than
met that challenge. That's why

36:33.692 --> 36:36.361
I wanted to thank you
for foiling

36:36.361 --> 36:39.464
this international
arms deal.
Thank you, sir.

36:39.464 --> 36:40.932
MAN: Good job, Murtaugh.
WOMAN: Good job, guys.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.467
WOMAN: Way to go.
Um...

36:42.467 --> 36:45.070
...here's a few expenses

36:45.070 --> 36:47.238
that you accrued
in the process.

36:51.176 --> 36:53.078
A boat?

36:53.078 --> 36:54.946
Her name was Lucille, sir.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.581
Lulu, I called her.

36:56.581 --> 36:59.517
Anyway, uh, Captain Avery said

36:59.517 --> 37:01.119
that I should clear
any reimbursements

37:01.119 --> 37:02.087
with you, Chief.

37:02.087 --> 37:04.255
Who the hell's Captain Avery?

37:04.255 --> 37:05.523
Exactly.

37:23.541 --> 37:25.143
Can you give
us a minute?

37:30.748 --> 37:33.118
Are you going to miss me?

37:34.652 --> 37:37.689
Well... hopefully,
you won't be gone long.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.724
I'm betting that
they're gonna give you

37:39.724 --> 37:41.693
a reduced sentence
for cooperating.

37:43.161 --> 37:45.096
Thank you, Cole.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.531
For everything.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.136
And when you get out,
your mother's painting

37:51.136 --> 37:54.372
will be waiting for you at the
National Museum of Lebanon.

37:54.372 --> 37:56.941
Where it belongs.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.394
You need to tell her, Cole.

38:16.394 --> 38:18.096
Tell who?

38:18.096 --> 38:20.498
The one you took to Anfeh.
Your ex.

38:20.498 --> 38:24.569
Tell her you still have feelings
for her before it is too late.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.756
The boat is gone.
Hmm.

38:44.756 --> 38:47.425
I've heard that before.

38:47.425 --> 38:49.594
Well, this time...

38:49.594 --> 38:53.097
it sleeps with the fishes.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.233
Honey...

38:55.233 --> 38:57.735
I am sorry about
your sanctuary.

38:57.735 --> 38:59.771
It wasn't really
about that.

38:59.771 --> 39:03.741
Besides, any grief
that I feel from you guys

39:03.741 --> 39:08.213
is tiny compared to the grief
I feel when we're apart.

39:08.213 --> 39:12.283
Then... why was it
so important to you?

39:12.283 --> 39:16.254
My entire life,
I've only been one place.

39:16.254 --> 39:19.090
And even though I never
took the boat anywhere,

39:19.090 --> 39:21.793
just knowing that I could...

39:21.793 --> 39:24.262
was enough.

39:25.663 --> 39:28.266
Well, you just
say the word,

39:28.266 --> 39:30.868
and I will go
anywhere with you,

39:30.868 --> 39:33.404
Roger Mayfield Murtaugh.

39:33.404 --> 39:35.807
And besides...

39:35.807 --> 39:38.142
you are going somewhere.

39:38.142 --> 39:39.344
Oh?

39:39.344 --> 39:40.478
Mm-hmm.
Where?

39:40.478 --> 39:41.679
Mm.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.348
To see Migos...

39:43.348 --> 39:44.682
in San Diego

39:44.682 --> 39:46.317
with your daughter

39:46.317 --> 39:50.655
and five
of her screaming friends.

39:52.423 --> 39:54.192
Wine?

39:54.192 --> 39:55.693
:
Yeah.
Okay.

39:55.693 --> 39:57.262
Lots.
Lots of wine.

39:58.663 --> 40:00.298
:
Natalie, there's something

40:00.298 --> 40:02.300
I haven't been totally honest
with you about.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.168
No.

40:04.168 --> 40:07.372
Natalie... there's something
I have to tell you.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.174
Cole.

40:10.174 --> 40:11.809
Hey.

40:11.809 --> 40:13.745
We meet again.

40:13.745 --> 40:14.812
Andrew.

40:14.812 --> 40:16.381
Is, uh, is Natalie here?

40:16.381 --> 40:18.182
She's not, actually.
She's not home yet.

40:18.182 --> 40:21.185
Is there something I
can pass on for you?

40:21.185 --> 40:24.322
No, just...
some Maya scheduling stuff.

40:24.322 --> 40:26.457
I'll call her.

40:26.457 --> 40:28.493
Hey, Cole.

40:28.493 --> 40:30.328
Before you go...

40:31.195 --> 40:33.231
I just want to say thank you.

40:33.231 --> 40:36.467
For not telling
Natalie my...

40:36.467 --> 40:38.303
secret.

40:38.303 --> 40:39.804
No problem.

40:39.804 --> 40:42.774
Yeah. I'm actually really
nervous about the whole thing.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.609
I'm doing the traditional thing,
you know, roses,

40:44.609 --> 40:46.344
champagne, a walk on the beach.

40:46.344 --> 40:47.845
I...

40:47.845 --> 40:50.348
I don't know, do you
think she'll like that?

40:50.348 --> 40:53.318
I only ask because
you two go way back.

40:53.318 --> 40:55.520
I think she'll love that.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.754
Yeah?
Yeah.

40:56.754 --> 40:57.822
Good luck.

40:57.822 --> 41:00.258
Thanks.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.530
Cole.

41:05.530 --> 41:08.366
What are you doing here?

41:09.200 --> 41:11.803
I-I just came to...

41:11.803 --> 41:13.304
thank you...

41:13.304 --> 41:15.807
for being there
for me last night.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.576
Oh. Always, Cole.

41:18.576 --> 41:20.278
You know that.

41:20.278 --> 41:22.647
That's why I love you.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.336
MURTAUGH:
Hey. What are you up to?

41:45.336 --> 41:47.538
Oh, I just went to my ex's house
to confess my feelings,

41:47.538 --> 41:48.639
and I got cold feet.

41:48.639 --> 41:49.907
How about you?

41:49.907 --> 41:51.876
Mm, well,
I'm sorry to hear that.

41:51.876 --> 41:53.978
Maybe you shouldn't be alone
this weekend.

41:53.978 --> 41:56.247
What do you got in mind?

41:56.247 --> 41:58.883
Me, you, concert,

41:58.883 --> 42:01.986
San Diego, ladies.

42:01.986 --> 42:03.588
Sounds awesome.

42:03.588 --> 42:04.889
There's a catch.

42:04.889 --> 42:07.658
If you touch the ladies,
I'll kill you.

42:07.658 --> 42:08.993
That sounds less awesome.

42:08.993 --> 42:10.595
There's more.

42:10.595 --> 42:13.698
Are you familiar
with this group, the Mugos?

42:13.698 --> 42:14.932
Roger, some alone time

42:14.932 --> 42:16.734
actually sounds nice.

42:16.734 --> 42:19.871
No, no, no. You owe me
for the "bilge pump" comment.
