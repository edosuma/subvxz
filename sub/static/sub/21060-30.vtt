"Cops" is filmed on location

with the men and women
of law enforcement.

All suspects are innocent

-Ortiz:
Been on the job two and a half
years for the city of Fontana,

00:45.689 --> 00:49.241
and best advice
a field training officer
has always given me is

00:49.275 --> 00:51.310
"Always keep your eyes open
in the back of your head,

00:51.344 --> 00:55.482
and "Any moment,
a calm situation
can turn deadly,"

00:55.517 --> 00:57.793
and that'’s something
that sticks with me to the day

00:57.827 --> 00:59.931
and what every officer
that works these days

00:59.965 --> 01:02.172
needs to learn and understand.

01:03.586 --> 01:06.689
All right, right now we'’re
en route to a disturbance

01:06.724 --> 01:08.310
at the neighbor'’s home,

01:08.344 --> 01:12.689
saying that several subjects
are out on the street, fighting.

01:12.724 --> 01:15.655
And our partner, just went 97.
-[radio chatter]

01:15.689 --> 01:17.344
-So she'’s out
with the subjects fighting,

01:17.379 --> 01:20.241
and she is calling
for another back, code 3.

-Ortiz: Come here.

01:34.068 --> 01:35.586
-I'’ll beat
your ass, so shut up!
-Turn around.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.206
-Don'’t touch me.
I ain'’t turning around nothing.

01:37.241 --> 01:38.896
I'’ll beat your ass.
-Get on the ground.

-I'’ll take you on too.
I'’ll take you on too.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.689

-I'’ll take
the two of you on too.
-Lay down on the ground.

01:44.965 --> 01:47.034
-That Taser ain'’t gonna help.
That billy club ain'’t
gonna help.

01:47.068 --> 01:49.206
That ain'’t gonna help.
I'’ll tell you right now.

01:49.241 --> 01:51.137
-I don'’t wanna Tase.
-I'’ll tell you, try it! Try it!

01:51.172 --> 01:54.137
Try it! Try it, all right?

-Lay down on the ground.

I'’m not doing nothing.
-What'’s going on?

02:00.620 --> 02:03.310
-I ain'’t doing nothing,
'’Cause my hands are
folded right here,

02:03.344 --> 02:05.655

Try it if you want to.
Try it if you want to.

02:13.103 --> 02:16.068
All your weapons--
it'’s simple, out here,
I'’ll beat your ass up.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.965
You ain'’t gonna help--
-Lay down on the ground

02:18.000 --> 02:19.931
or I'’m gonna hit you
with this baton.
-No, I'’m not.

02:19.965 --> 02:22.586
I'’m not! Try it if you want to!
-Lay down on the ground or I'’m
gonna hit you with this.

Get on the ground!
-Look here, look here.

02:30.172 --> 02:33.620
-Get on the ground!
-Look here, look here.
I'’m on the ground.

02:33.655 --> 02:35.655
-Lay on your stomach now!
-No, that'’s it.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.241
-Lay on your stomach now!

02:37.275 --> 02:39.103
-That didn'’t help,
and I didn'’t do nothing.

02:39.137 --> 02:41.379
No, I'’m cooperating.
I'’m fully cooperating.

02:41.413 --> 02:44.862
I'’m fully cooperating.
[grunts]

02:44.896 --> 02:47.551
I'’m fully cooperating,
so ain'’t no need for that.

02:47.586 --> 02:50.689
Ain'’t no need for that.
I'’m fully cooperating.

02:50.724 --> 02:52.172
I'’m fully cooperating...

02:53.206 --> 02:54.448
so ain'’t need for all that.

02:55.931 --> 02:57.620
I'’m fully cooperating.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.379
Y'’all tried it,
it obviously didn'’t work,

02:59.413 --> 03:01.965
and I'’m fully cooperating,
so ain'’t need for that.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.862
-Box 2, we got
one detained and one--
-That'’s what I'm talking about.

03:04.896 --> 03:07.482
No, it'’s not. No, it's not.
-Hey, see what her problem
is for a minute?

03:07.517 --> 03:08.862
-No, it'’s not. She lying.

03:08.896 --> 03:10.413
She lying.
I'’m telling you, she lying.

03:10.448 --> 03:12.931
-So, what'’s going on tonight?
-Uhh... [sighs]

03:12.965 --> 03:15.689
-How do you know him?
-A friend. He'’s from Fontana.

03:15.724 --> 03:17.241
I'’m from Fontana.
This is my uncle'’s house.

03:17.275 --> 03:19.413
He'’s-- he's
from this neighborhood.

03:19.448 --> 03:21.965
He'’s a friend--
-Is he friend, family, or what?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.655
-He'’s not blood relation
to me, but yeah, he'’s a friend
of my family.

03:24.689 --> 03:28.068
-Okay. Yeah.
-He'’s related to my kids--
my kids. Related to my kids.

03:28.103 --> 03:29.551
-Man: I ain'’t trying
to talk to you.

03:29.586 --> 03:32.172
-So what'’s he doing tonight?
Is he drunk? Drugs? What'’s his--

03:32.206 --> 03:34.689
-I don'’t know. I don't know.
I don'’t know what's
wrong with him.

03:34.724 --> 03:37.551
-Who'’s he arguing with out here?
-Everybody. The whole--

03:37.586 --> 03:39.137
he'’s disturbing everybody.

03:39.172 --> 03:41.034
-Anything physical, like--
-This is his cousin right here.

03:41.068 --> 03:42.827
-Is he hitting anybody
or anything like that?

03:42.862 --> 03:45.413
-No one'’s involved
with him. No, he'’s not involved
in a physical altercation.

03:45.448 --> 03:46.931
He'’s just trying
to push him back.

03:46.965 --> 03:49.275
-Trying to keep him
away from you guys? Okay.

03:49.310 --> 03:51.344
-Me.
-Trying to figure out
what'’s going on, okay?

03:51.379 --> 03:53.620
Listen. You'’re not
cooperating right now.
-Look, look. Thank you.

03:53.655 --> 03:55.448
-You'’re welcome, but--
-Thank you and I'’m not tripping.

03:55.482 --> 03:56.793
And I'’m not tripping.
And you see that?

03:56.827 --> 03:58.482
-Yeah.
-And so you know
I'’m not tripping.

03:58.517 --> 04:00.620
I'’m letting y'all
do everything I want,
so you know I'’m not tripping.

04:00.655 --> 04:02.896
-All right. Give me a sec.
Let'’s figure out what's
going on, okay?

04:02.931 --> 04:04.206
-Thank you.
-All right.

04:04.241 --> 04:06.206
-That'’s all I ask.
That'’s all I ask.
-All right.

04:06.241 --> 04:08.000
-Woman:
He just started with--
a fight with everybody.

04:08.034 --> 04:09.551
He just wanted to start
a fight with everybody.

04:09.586 --> 04:10.758
-Just like you saw with us?

04:10.793 --> 04:12.482
-That'’s all right there.
That'’s all right there,

04:12.517 --> 04:14.379
except he was charging at me.
-He was charging at you?

04:14.413 --> 04:17.172
-Yeah, my people was breaking
him up, like, "Back up,"
trying to separate us.

04:17.206 --> 04:20.758
-You guys have
some... relationship?
What'’s the deal?

04:21.827 --> 04:23.206
-Long time ago.
-Just friends?

04:23.241 --> 04:25.137
-Long time ago.
Just a friend of the family.

04:25.172 --> 04:27.275
-That'’s what I said,
so he took my keys.
-He took your keys?

04:27.310 --> 04:29.827
-Yeah, he got my keys.
Those are my keys right there.
-How'’d he get your keys?

04:29.862 --> 04:31.344
-He snatched them from me,
out of my hand.

04:31.379 --> 04:34.034
-You had '’em in your hand?
He yanked '’em out of your hand?

04:34.068 --> 04:36.034
'’Cause you were trying to leave?

04:36.068 --> 04:37.724
-Because I was trying
to lock the door.

04:37.758 --> 04:39.310
Lock him--
yeah, trying to lock him

04:39.344 --> 04:41.551
up out of the house,
and he snagged my keys.
-Okay.

04:41.586 --> 04:45.344
-"Leh-mond," is that your name?
"Leh-mond," am I pronouncing
that right?

04:45.379 --> 04:46.896
-"Lee." Lemond.
-Lemond.

04:46.931 --> 04:48.413
-Lemond. Y'’all see
what'’s going on?
-All right.

04:48.448 --> 04:49.965
-I'’ll tell y'all everything
that'’s going on.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.206
-I get that there may have been
an argument out here,

04:52.241 --> 04:54.172
but why didn'’t you want
to listen to us?

04:54.206 --> 04:57.068
-It was on me,
because I wasn'’t doing
what they were saying

04:57.103 --> 04:59.793
and they were doing it like,
"We already called the police
because we want to.

04:59.827 --> 05:02.034
"No matter how much you see,
we gonna try to set you up

05:02.068 --> 05:03.448
and make you seem
how we want to."
-Uh-huh.

05:03.482 --> 05:05.310
-I said, "When they get here,
I ain'’t going nowhere."

05:05.344 --> 05:07.862
Then finally, I said,
"I'’m not going anywhere.
I'’m gonna wait till they come."

05:07.896 --> 05:10.689
-How come when
we got here, you couldn'’t listen
and follow our commands?

05:10.724 --> 05:12.517
-I was trying to,
but I already knew
what they did.

05:12.551 --> 05:14.000
-Okay, why couldn'’t
you listen to us,

05:14.034 --> 05:15.655
regardless of what they did?
-I was trying to.

05:15.689 --> 05:18.000
I put my hands up, and I was
like, "I'’m not tripping.
I'’m not tripping.

05:18.034 --> 05:19.827
I'’m not acting out.
I'’m not doing nothing."

05:19.862 --> 05:21.862
-So when
you said you were gonna--
you were gonna fight us--

05:21.896 --> 05:24.034
-No, I wasn'’t,
because I was trying
to cooperate at the same time.

05:24.068 --> 05:25.551
-Well, why'’d you say
you were gonna fight me?

05:25.586 --> 05:26.931
-Because I was
trying to cooperate,

05:26.965 --> 05:28.724
and at the same time y'’all
weren'’t listening to nothing.

05:28.758 --> 05:30.827
-You were trying
to cooperate by saying
you were gonna fight me?

05:30.862 --> 05:32.103
-No, I wasn'’t.
I was cooperating.

05:32.137 --> 05:33.793
My hands was up.
"I'’m not doing nothing."

05:33.827 --> 05:36.517
At the same time,
y'’all was like, "No, no,"
they was like, "This is him,"

05:36.551 --> 05:38.103
and y'’all read it
how you wanted to.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.896
-Lemond, the paramedics
are gonna look at you,

05:39.931 --> 05:41.827
'’cause you got Tased,
and you got hit with the baton.

05:41.862 --> 05:43.655
-So what? I'’m okay.
-Okay, well, do you--

05:43.689 --> 05:46.448
are you gonna be okay--
cool with them to look
at you real quick?

05:46.482 --> 05:48.689
-Yes, I am. I'’m okay.
-All right. Not gonna have
any more issues?

05:48.724 --> 05:50.655
-No.
-You know what
that gets you, right?

05:50.689 --> 05:52.413
-I know.
-The back of a police car.

05:52.448 --> 05:54.103
-As I said, I don'’t have
no problem with that.

05:54.137 --> 05:56.827
-All right.
-That'’s it. Y'all tried to
get me, I said, "Don'’t do that.

05:56.862 --> 05:59.862
I'’m gonna cooperate."
-When'’s the last time
you smoked meth, Lemond?

05:59.896 --> 06:02.827
-I don'’t smoke meth.
I don'’t [bleeps] with meth.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.758
-Well, when'’s the last time
you messed with meth?

06:04.793 --> 06:06.758
-I don'’t mess with meth,
and it'’s not my choice.

06:06.793 --> 06:09.034
I don'’t [bleeps] with it.
-So what-- what do you do?

06:09.068 --> 06:12.862
-I don'’t [bleeps] with it.
I smoke weed, I drink beer

06:12.896 --> 06:14.379
and maybe some liquor.

06:14.413 --> 06:17.482
-Okay. Well,
that white cake-like substance
on your-- on your tongue

06:17.517 --> 06:20.137
and the fluttering
of your eyes when--
when you close your eyelids

06:20.172 --> 06:23.379
and you tilt
your head back, tells me
you'’re on some sort of...

06:23.413 --> 06:25.758
upper, as some
people like to say.
-Okay. Okay, if I am-- if I am,

06:25.793 --> 06:27.758
I don'’t know nothing about it.
Somebody slipped it to me,

06:27.793 --> 06:29.655
and that'’s what I'm telling you,
honestly, to God.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.344
-Okay. All right.
-You know I'’m not lying.

06:31.379 --> 06:33.655
-Lemond,
get your knees in there.
I don'’t wanna bump 'em.

06:33.689 --> 06:35.413
Here you go.
-Come on, man.
I don'’t want that.

06:35.448 --> 06:38.758
-Lemond, you just gotta
lay off the juice and you
gotta lay off the drugs, okay?

06:38.793 --> 06:41.379
'’Cause no,
you didn'’t admit to it,
but I know you'’re using drugs.

06:41.413 --> 06:44.896
All right? You got a long
list of-- rap sheet of what
you'’ve been arrested for.

06:44.931 --> 06:47.241
-Okay, what that is,
I ain'’t on today.

06:47.275 --> 06:49.206
That'’s why
I ain'’t been back
to jail in how long?

06:49.241 --> 06:51.000
-Well, we'’re gonna try
and get you some help, okay?

06:51.034 --> 06:53.862
But now you'’re
under arrest for resisting,
public intoxication.

06:53.896 --> 06:56.344
-When was I trying to resist?
-Threatening to fight the police

06:56.379 --> 06:58.724
and putting your hands up
with balled fists counts
as resisting.

06:58.758 --> 07:00.517
-I put my hands up
in a guarding manner.

07:03.103 --> 07:04.551
-Green: I think
you come in to make

07:04.586 --> 07:06.275
a positive difference
in your community.

07:06.310 --> 07:07.896
It'’s definitely
a challenging career.

07:07.931 --> 07:11.275
Oftentimes,
you'’re dealing with people
in their worst moments,

07:11.310 --> 07:13.862
but I honestly believe
that I come to work

07:13.896 --> 07:15.758
with the best people
as coworkers,

07:15.793 --> 07:18.000
and they'’re people that have
become family to me.

07:18.034 --> 07:20.068
And that'’s what keeps me
coming into work.

07:22.482 --> 07:25.137
A subject I know
just took off on a bike.

07:25.172 --> 07:28.206
He has a warrant,
so we'’re just trying
to catch up with him here.

07:30.931 --> 07:34.620
-[radio chirps]
-2858, got a wanted guy

07:34.655 --> 07:36.310
taking off from me on a bike.

07:36.344 --> 07:38.206
He'’s McLoughlin at Division.

07:39.310 --> 07:41.758
He just went up
the pedestrian pathway,

07:41.793 --> 07:43.517
so I'’m have to drive around,
so I lost sight of him,

07:43.551 --> 07:44.965
but he'’s got a warrant.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.517
He'’s male, white,
black clothing,

07:47.551 --> 07:49.310
about six feet tall,

07:49.344 --> 07:51.793
and he'’s got "JPS" tattooed
on his neck.

07:54.862 --> 07:56.862
-[indistinct radio chatter]

08:00.793 --> 08:01.827
[radio chirps]

08:04.206 --> 08:05.827
-Stop your bike right now, dude.

08:05.862 --> 08:09.275
-[man speaks indistinctly]
-It'’s-- I've told you your name.

08:09.310 --> 08:11.310
-[man shouts]
-[radio chirps]

08:11.344 --> 08:12.965
-It'’s not me, man.
-I'’m with him.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.241
We'’re going northbound
on McLoughlin.

08:19.862 --> 08:21.448
Stop your bike, man.
-[man shouts]

08:23.827 --> 08:26.310
-I ain'’t Biggers!
I ain'’t Biggers!

08:26.344 --> 08:28.758
My name'’s not Biggers!

08:28.793 --> 08:30.310
-Get on the ground, dude.
-My name'’s--

08:30.344 --> 08:33.068
-I'’m gonna Taser--
get on the ground right now!

08:33.103 --> 08:35.896
Get on the ground!
-[panting] My name'’s--

08:35.931 --> 08:38.310
-On your stomach!
-Okay.

08:38.344 --> 08:41.689
-Arms out. Arms out!
-They'’re out. They're out.

08:41.724 --> 08:44.172
-There you go.
Cross your ankles.
-Enough, dude.

08:44.206 --> 08:47.275
-Stay right there.
-I really have to pee.

08:47.310 --> 08:49.344
-I'’m with him at the tracks.

08:49.379 --> 08:52.000
Just come south on McLoughlin,
and you'’ll see my car.

08:53.137 --> 08:55.379
And we'’re code 4 right now.

08:55.413 --> 08:56.931
Don'’t move
or you'’re gonna get Tased, okay?

08:56.965 --> 08:58.517
-Don'’t wanna get Tased, bro.
-What'’s that?

08:58.551 --> 09:00.344
-Don'’t wanna get Tased.
-Okay.

09:01.620 --> 09:03.517
-What'’s the warrant for, dude?

09:03.551 --> 09:05.931
-I don'’t know. You tell me.
-I don'’t know.

09:05.965 --> 09:08.172
-You gotta stop lying
about your name, dude.

09:08.206 --> 09:10.103
Stay down on the ground.

09:10.137 --> 09:12.000
-Can I get my breath, please?
-Stay down on the ground.

09:12.034 --> 09:13.689
-I just wanna get
my breath too, please.
-I know.

09:13.724 --> 09:15.551
We'’ll take care of that
when another cop shows up, okay?

09:17.344 --> 09:18.689
-Man: What'’s that
warrant for, dude?

09:18.724 --> 09:20.034
-Green: I'’ll tell you in a sec.

09:20.068 --> 09:22.724
-I gotta-- I gotta, please,
stand up a little bit.

09:22.758 --> 09:24.620
-What'’s that?
-I'’m having trouble
catching my breath, bro.

09:24.655 --> 09:25.965
-I know.
-All right?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.275
-It'’s all right.
-[man mumbles]

09:28.310 --> 09:29.724
-All right.
We'’ll get you up.

09:29.758 --> 09:31.137
-You'’re done though, right?
-Huh?

09:31.172 --> 09:32.724
-You'’re done though, right?
-No more, man.

09:32.758 --> 09:33.758
-All right.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.586
-You good?
-Yeah.

09:36.620 --> 09:38.448
-I'’m not playing.
-We'’ll get you up.

09:38.482 --> 09:40.482
Stand up, man.
-Just having trouble
catching my breath.

09:42.862 --> 09:44.448
-Get his backpack off.
-Yeah.

09:47.517 --> 09:49.931
-No needles
or anything like that, right?
-Uh-uh.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.724
-My bike tool.
-What'’s up?

09:51.758 --> 09:54.931
-My bike tool, my phone.

09:54.965 --> 09:57.448
-Nothing hidden on you?
Nothing in your socks?
-No. No.

09:57.482 --> 09:59.793
-Can you hold your waistline--
or your hands up so I see
your waistline?

09:59.827 --> 10:00.827
All right.

10:02.379 --> 10:03.965
You have the right
to remain silent.
-Right.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.758
-Anything you say
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

10:06.793 --> 10:08.034
You have the right
to talk to a lawyer

10:08.068 --> 10:10.000
and have them present
while you'’re being questioned.

10:10.034 --> 10:12.931
If you cannot afford to hire
a lawyer, one will be appointed
to represent you at no expense.

10:12.965 --> 10:15.586
Do you understand your rights?
Do you understand your rights?
-[mumbles] I do.

10:15.620 --> 10:17.758
So what am I being held for?
-You got warrants.

10:17.793 --> 10:19.413
-Warrants for what?
-I'’ll tell you in a minute.

10:19.448 --> 10:21.103
-Okay.
-So, why'’d you run?

10:21.137 --> 10:23.448
-Huh? I didn'’t run at all.

10:23.482 --> 10:25.482
You told me to take off.
-You mean when I was
saying, "Stop"?

10:25.517 --> 10:27.379
-You told me to take off.
-Oh yeah, that'’s what I said.

10:27.413 --> 10:28.724
-Huh?
-Come on.

10:28.758 --> 10:31.655
-So what are the warrants for?
-I gotta go look right now.

10:31.689 --> 10:34.206
You know that
I'’ve talked to you in the past,
arrested you in the past, right?

10:34.241 --> 10:35.862
You know I know who you are.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.758
-I-- I think you know who I am.

10:37.793 --> 10:40.137
-So tell me
who you are.
-Huh?

10:40.172 --> 10:42.310
-I'’m not talking,
man, till you tell me--
-So tell me who you are.

10:42.344 --> 10:44.413
-I'’m not talking, man,
'’cause you falsely
arrested me, dude.

10:44.448 --> 10:47.758
-Fa-- I'’m just looking
for honesty. That'’s it.
-Huh?

10:47.793 --> 10:49.724
Looking for honesty?
-Uh-huh.

10:49.758 --> 10:52.310
You know who I am, man.
-We ask the questions we already
know the answers to,

10:52.344 --> 10:54.103
trying to get
a little honesty, all right?

10:54.137 --> 10:56.310
-You know who I am, man.
-You say your name is James
or something

10:56.344 --> 10:59.034
when I talk to you,
and then you take off.

10:59.068 --> 11:01.689
-You told me to take off, dude.
-Oh, okay. Sit tight for a sec.

11:03.379 --> 11:05.827
Obviously
he didn'’t recognize me,
but I recognized him

11:05.862 --> 11:08.655
and knew immediately
he was lying about his name.

11:08.689 --> 11:11.965
He'’s on paper for burglary,
so-- and that'’s what
the warrant'’s for,

11:12.000 --> 11:16.413
so see if there'’s
any evidence of further burgs
that he'’s done...

11:18.241 --> 11:20.965
which having a lot
of cellphones probably indicates

11:21.000 --> 11:22.413
he'’s a car prowler
or something,

11:22.448 --> 11:26.310
but that might be affiliated
with burglaries, though.

11:26.344 --> 11:28.517
Let'’s go see
what'’s up with him.

11:28.551 --> 11:31.344
-Man: Cut to the chase, man.
-"Cut to the chase"? Okay.

11:31.379 --> 11:34.275
-PB'’s out on me?
-Yeah, for burglary.

11:34.310 --> 11:36.206
Well, you know,
I'’ve arrested you before, right?

11:36.241 --> 11:38.379
-I just don'’t remember where.
-You don'’t remember?

11:38.413 --> 11:40.000
Underneath the Burnside Bridge.

11:40.034 --> 11:43.068
-Oh yeah, you guys
got me [bleeps]. Yeah.
Yes, you did.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.034
-[laughing]
-That'’s good.
That'’s good. Very good.

11:45.068 --> 11:47.896
-Yeah, I know.
So, why you run?

11:47.931 --> 11:50.137
-I really didn'’t run.
You told me to go.

11:50.172 --> 11:52.724
-How'’d I tell you to go?
You'’re saying your
name'’s Johnson,

11:52.758 --> 11:55.206
I was saying,
"If your name'’s Johnson,
then take off."

11:55.241 --> 11:57.724
-Listen, your verbatim was--

11:57.758 --> 11:59.586
you said , "If you'’re Steve...
then get outta here."

11:59.620 --> 12:01.689
-No, I said, "If your name'’s
Johnson, take off."

12:01.724 --> 12:03.931
I to-- I told you who you were.

12:03.965 --> 12:06.000
-I think there was
a mix-up in words then.

12:06.034 --> 12:08.206
It makes me worry.
I'’m not sure if it was
on your part or my part.

12:08.241 --> 12:10.482
-Well, I'’m yelling out
the window for you to stop.
Why don'’t you stop?

12:10.517 --> 12:12.172
-[bleeps] bike ain'’t got
no brakes on it, man.

12:12.206 --> 12:14.206
You'’re not stopping
because it didn'’t have
any brakes?

12:14.241 --> 12:16.275
-Uh-huh.

12:16.310 --> 12:19.482
-Then when you'’re up on McLough
and you poke out down the other
side of the pedestrian trail

12:19.517 --> 12:21.655
and you don'’t go down there
'’cause we're sitting there.

12:21.689 --> 12:22.965
-I had every intention
to stop for you.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.344
-You had
every intention to stop?

12:24.379 --> 12:25.655
See if it was safe
for me to stop.

12:25.689 --> 12:27.862
All right, well, you'’re going
to jail for the warrant

12:27.896 --> 12:30.793
and probably interfering
with a peace officer--

12:30.827 --> 12:32.931
-Come on, man.
Cut-cut-- cut me loose, dude.

12:32.965 --> 12:35.034
-Cut you loose?
I can'’t cut you loose.
You got a warrant.

12:35.068 --> 12:37.482
-No, no, I'’m talking
about interfering
with a peace officer, dude.

12:37.517 --> 12:39.482
I'’m not [bleeps]
causing menace to you.

12:39.517 --> 12:42.172
I don'’t [bleeps]
sell drugs. I don'’t do none
of that stuff, man.

12:42.206 --> 12:43.551
-Okay. What are
you out here doing?

12:43.586 --> 12:45.344
-[bleeps] I was trying
to find my wife, dude.

12:45.379 --> 12:47.793
-Where'’s your wife?
-We got in a big fight
yesterday morning again,

12:47.827 --> 12:50.689
boundaries.
-So you'’re beefing with her?

12:50.724 --> 12:53.448
-[mumbles]
-Are you on the streets
right now?

12:53.482 --> 12:56.344
-Um, we would be...

12:56.379 --> 12:58.862
but we got some kind people
watching out for us now.

12:58.896 --> 13:01.517
-You got people
looking out for you? Good.

13:01.551 --> 13:03.724
Streets aren'’t a place for you.
Are you using?

13:03.758 --> 13:05.172
-Yeah, I am.
-What? What?

13:05.206 --> 13:06.862
-Yeah, I am.
-Yeah?

13:06.896 --> 13:10.034
Do you got any meth hidden
on you or in your backpack
I didn'’t find?

13:10.068 --> 13:12.275
-I really don'’t want
to be charged, man.
-What'’s that?

13:12.310 --> 13:13.931
-I really don'’t want
to be charged.

13:13.965 --> 13:15.896
-I appreciate
your honesty now.

13:15.931 --> 13:18.000
All right, man.
-[car door closes]

13:20.517 --> 13:22.896
-Hixson:
So, I'’m originally from
a small town in Tennessee,

13:22.931 --> 13:25.379
and I did four years
in the Marine Corps.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.689
As I was getting out,
a good friend of mine,

13:27.724 --> 13:30.689
he'’s like,
"Hey, Colton PD is hiring,
so why don'’t you try it out?"

13:30.724 --> 13:33.586
So, 12 days after I got out
of the Marine Corps,

13:33.620 --> 13:35.310
I started at the police academy,

13:35.344 --> 13:38.413
and I'’ve been
at Colton PD ever since.

13:38.448 --> 13:41.758
Following this car right now.
It'’s registration is expired,

13:41.793 --> 13:44.068
so we'’ll try
to get up here and stop her

13:44.103 --> 13:47.172
and see what'’s going on
with her registration.

13:47.206 --> 13:50.241
They'’re pulling into a--
into a house right here.

13:52.275 --> 13:53.482
-[door opens]

13:55.172 --> 13:59.034
-[indistinct chatter]

13:59.068 --> 14:00.758
-[car door closes]
-Hixson: Stay in the car.

14:00.793 --> 14:02.172
Sir, can you go
somewhere else please?

14:02.206 --> 14:04.103
-I had her pull the car up,
'’cause I was working on it.

14:04.137 --> 14:06.379
-Hixson:
Okay, just stay up there.
Do you live here?

14:06.413 --> 14:07.793
-No, he was working on my car.

14:07.827 --> 14:09.275
-Are you on parole
or probation right now?

14:09.310 --> 14:12.827
-I had a probation,
but it was just for an old DUI.

14:12.862 --> 14:15.172
-Do you have a driver'’s license?

14:15.206 --> 14:16.689
-No, I don'’t.
-You don'’t have one.

14:16.724 --> 14:18.068
-How old are you?
-I'’m 26.

14:18.103 --> 14:19.965
-Do you have something
with your name?
-Yes.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.827
Do you mind if I get my son?
-No, just hang out and then

14:22.862 --> 14:24.655
and when we'’re done,
you can go do what
you need to do.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.517
Is there anything in the car
you'’re not supposed to have?

14:26.551 --> 14:28.000
-No.
-Nothing at all?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.793
-No.
-No pipes, no dope,
nothing like that?

14:29.827 --> 14:31.448
-No.
-So you don'’t mind
if I check?

14:31.482 --> 14:32.551
-No.
-Okay.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.241
Go ahead and step for me.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.793
Whose car is this?
-It'’s my stepdad's.

14:37.827 --> 14:39.586
Put your hands up
on the top of the car.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.310
Hands on top of the car.

14:41.344 --> 14:43.896
Anything on you
where I can'’t check?

14:43.931 --> 14:45.344
-No.
-Okay.

14:45.379 --> 14:47.241
Spin for me. Spin.

14:47.275 --> 14:49.068
I want to see your waistband,
make sure you don'’t have

14:49.103 --> 14:50.862
some gun or pistol tucked
or nothing like that.

14:50.896 --> 14:53.551
-No.
-Okay, just go stand
over here by my car.

14:53.586 --> 14:56.793
So you are still on probation?
But you don'’t have any
warrants right now,

14:56.827 --> 14:58.896
so whatever classes
or whatever you missed,

14:58.931 --> 15:01.862
you need to take care of that
before they do issue warrants,

15:01.896 --> 15:04.344
especially if you have
a baby, all right?

15:06.551 --> 15:08.689
Is this all you have?
-What?

15:08.724 --> 15:11.551
-Is this all the dope you have?
-Um, yeah.

15:11.586 --> 15:12.931
-Where'’s the rest of it?

15:14.931 --> 15:17.068
Because you told me
you didn'’t have any
earlier at all,

15:17.103 --> 15:18.965
and now there'’s
a little bit here.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.586
Is there anything else
I'’m gonna find in there?

15:21.620 --> 15:24.103
-Woman: No.
-Hey, Nadine,
I'’ll be real honest with you.

15:24.137 --> 15:26.655
I'’m an honest person,
so I want you to be
honest with me.

15:26.689 --> 15:29.724
Is there anything else?
-I have been honest. I told you
about the ones, so.

15:29.758 --> 15:31.689
-You didn'’t tell me
about the dollar bill

15:31.724 --> 15:33.034
with the little bit
of dope in there.

15:33.068 --> 15:34.689
That'’s not much.
It'’s still a misdemeanor.

15:34.724 --> 15:36.137
Is there anything else in there?

15:36.172 --> 15:38.103
Because if you tell me, "No,"
and I think there is,

15:38.137 --> 15:40.689
then I'’m gonna search
the whole car, and I'’m gonna
pull the whole thing apart.

15:40.724 --> 15:43.068
-Yeah, there'’s some in my purse.
-There'’s some more what?

15:43.103 --> 15:44.689
There'’s some more dope?
-Mm-hmm.

15:44.724 --> 15:46.068
-Okay. How much?

15:49.103 --> 15:51.620
-Umm, maybe a gram?
-Okay.

15:53.551 --> 15:56.551
So inside this dollar--
she had it folded up
in a little bundle.

15:56.586 --> 15:58.551
It'’s pretty common.
Just one way they carry it.

15:58.586 --> 16:01.517
It'’s not much at all.
Whatever she had,
she'’s already used it.

16:01.551 --> 16:03.172
Here'’s another little baggie.

16:03.206 --> 16:05.517
She'’s buying and using
methamphetamine,

16:05.551 --> 16:08.034
so she'’s saying that
there'’s some more in here.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.965
We'’ll check it out and see.

16:11.896 --> 16:13.379
This is real typical...

16:14.758 --> 16:17.965
stuff you'’ll find
on these people
who use these.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.896
Where'’s the rest
of it at, Nadine?

16:19.931 --> 16:21.551
Do you know where
in your purse you keep it?

16:21.586 --> 16:24.448
-Um, the separate black one,
the one right there.

16:24.482 --> 16:25.551
-In here?
-Yeah.

16:25.586 --> 16:26.896
-Do you work, Nadine?
-I'’m sorry?

16:26.931 --> 16:28.344
-Do you work?
-No.

16:28.379 --> 16:31.275
-Here'’s gonna be
the other little gram
she was talking about,

16:31.310 --> 16:34.724
just your basic usable amount
of methamphetamine.

16:34.758 --> 16:37.172
But the sad part
is the first thing
you talked to her,

16:37.206 --> 16:39.724
she says, "Oh,
let me get my baby. I have
a one-year-old baby," but...

16:41.448 --> 16:43.827
she'’s driving around
with no driver'’s license

16:43.862 --> 16:45.344
in an unregistered car...

16:46.482 --> 16:48.344
with a purse
full of cash and dope.

16:48.379 --> 16:50.620
She has no job, so...

16:51.724 --> 16:53.241
It'’s sad, but you see it a lot.

16:53.275 --> 16:56.448
She has kids,
but obviously her first
priority isn'’t her kids.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.206
Turn around for me, Nadine.

17:00.448 --> 17:02.000
Turn around.
Put your hands
behind your back.

17:02.034 --> 17:03.758
-Can I figure something out
for my kids, please?

17:05.206 --> 17:07.034
-Now you'’re worried
about your kids?

17:07.068 --> 17:09.241
-What do you mean, "Now"?
-It'’s 12:30 at night,

17:09.275 --> 17:10.896
you'’re out driving
with dope and no--

17:10.931 --> 17:13.172
-I'’m not driving
around with dope.
He was working on my car.

17:13.206 --> 17:14.724
-Right, at 12:30 at night.

17:14.758 --> 17:16.034
-He-- I'’ve been here
for a while.

17:16.068 --> 17:17.344
It didn'’t take 10 minutes.

17:18.724 --> 17:21.275
Oh my god.

17:21.310 --> 17:24.000
-We'’re wanted to believe
that you'’re working on your car
in the middle of the night?

17:24.034 --> 17:25.931
-I swear.
Look, he told me to take it

17:25.965 --> 17:28.206
around the block
for a test drive. I swear.

17:28.241 --> 17:30.862
-Here, have a seat.
-I can'’t just leave
my kids here.

17:30.896 --> 17:32.517
-How many kids
do you have here?
-Two.

17:34.103 --> 17:37.586
-How old are they?
-Eight and two.

17:37.620 --> 17:40.551
-Eight and two?
So, you knew you had
dope in the car.

17:40.586 --> 17:42.758
You knew if you got pulled over,
you were gonna go to jail,

17:42.793 --> 17:44.206
and your car was
gonna get towed.

17:45.586 --> 17:48.241
Then you'’re still driving
around with no license--

17:48.275 --> 17:51.482
that'’s a 30-day tow--
with dope.

17:51.517 --> 17:54.620
I can book you into West Valley,
and we can have CPS come
pick up your kids.

17:54.655 --> 17:56.793
I know what
goes on in this house,
so when you pulled up here,

17:56.827 --> 17:59.586
I knew what you had in the car.
You know you shouldn'’t be here.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.379
You'’re gonna end up
losing your kids over dope...

18:02.965 --> 18:04.517
'’cause you don't care
about them.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.379
So if you don'’t care about them,

18:06.413 --> 18:08.172
then maybe if they'’re
in the system somewhere,

18:08.206 --> 18:11.068
maybe they'’ll end up
in a home where someone
does care about them.

18:12.413 --> 18:14.103
Stop using dope.

18:14.137 --> 18:16.724
All right, Nadine,
we got a couple of options.

18:16.758 --> 18:19.344
One, tow the car,
take you to West Valley,

18:19.379 --> 18:22.344
have CPS come get your kids.
-[crying] Please don'’t do that.

18:22.379 --> 18:24.620
-Well, then what--
what do you expect me to do?
-[sobbing]

18:26.310 --> 18:29.620
-If you were in my shoes,
what would you do?

18:29.655 --> 18:32.586
Throw the dope on the ground,
let you go home, tell you,
"Don'’t do it again"?

18:32.620 --> 18:34.448
You need to straighten
your life up, ma'’am.

18:34.482 --> 18:37.551
'’Cause that's fair to all
the other people I'’ve arrested
for the same thing.

18:37.586 --> 18:40.241
-Do you care about your kids?
-Nadine: Yes.

18:40.275 --> 18:42.965
-Do you care about '’em enough
to get off of dope?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.103
-Yeah.
-What-- what steps have
you taken to get off dope?

18:48.620 --> 18:51.137
-I tried, but--
-How-- how did you--

18:51.172 --> 18:52.689
-I mean, I know
I can'’t tell you guys.

18:52.724 --> 18:56.862
You... guys don'’t know.
-No, tell me. T-- try me.

18:56.896 --> 18:59.413
-But when you try--
when you get off of it,

18:59.448 --> 19:00.931
all you can do is sleep it off,

19:00.965 --> 19:03.689
and I can'’t sleep and have
my kids all the time.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.896
-That doesn'’t last forever.
-I know it doesn'’t.

19:07.931 --> 19:10.068
-So, get some family members
to help you out.

19:10.103 --> 19:12.551
-I'’ll give you another option,
you tell me which one
sounds better.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.896
All right?
You go get your kids right now,

19:14.931 --> 19:17.586
you put '’em
in the car, you get outta here,
and you don'’t come back here.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.793
-I wanna get my kids.
-Stop using dope.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.551
I don'’t do this.
I usually take people to jail,

19:23.586 --> 19:25.448
but I'’m not tonight,
because of your kids.
-Okay.

19:25.482 --> 19:26.758
I'’m giving you
a chance tonight.

19:26.793 --> 19:27.896
I'’m gonna
let you take your kids,

19:27.931 --> 19:29.448
I'’m gonna write you
a cite for the dope,

19:29.482 --> 19:30.793
'’cause it's only
a misdemeanor.

19:30.827 --> 19:32.206
I'’ll give you
a court date for it.

19:32.241 --> 19:33.344
All right. Step out.

19:34.896 --> 19:37.482
Let this be a lesson.
-Definitely.

19:37.517 --> 19:39.137
-You have no felonies.
You can get a job.

19:39.172 --> 19:41.172
You can go to school
before you ruin your life.

19:41.206 --> 19:43.413
-Yeah, you'’re right.
-There'’s programs out there
that can help you.

19:43.448 --> 19:46.241
You need to make efforts,
so think about your choices.

19:46.275 --> 19:48.241
And if you can'’t
do it for yourself,
do it for your kids.

19:50.275 --> 19:52.448
-132 and Bush,
I'’ve got him at gunpoint.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.413
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.448 --> 19:55.586
Cover is code three.

19:55.620 --> 19:58.551
-[overlapping
police radio chatter]

20:04.724 --> 20:06.655
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'’ll still send
a code three.

20:06.689 --> 20:07.862
-[theme music playing]
