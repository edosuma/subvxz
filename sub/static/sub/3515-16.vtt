Have I done something wrong?

00:04.000 --> 00:05.081
Actually, yes,

00:05.840 --> 00:07.410

No!

MEISNER: Not exactly, but he can
point them in the right direction.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.361
I suggest you move,
and the sooner, the better.

00:16.440 --> 00:17.521
That's not gonna be easy.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.761
There's three of us now.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.361
The only thing you
have to worry about now

is that we find them.

something appears

00:43.040 --> 00:45.281
that is so horrible, so vicious,

00:46.480 --> 00:48.403
it cannot be tamed,

00:48.480 --> 00:52.405
for this beast is
the demented turmoil

00:52.480 --> 00:54.642
of man himself,

00:54.720 --> 00:59.169
hidden from view
until it is too late.

Do not be fooled by
the way he looks now.

No.

On both sides.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.324
My parents were
married in the Cascades.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.561
In the mountains?

03:57.840 --> 03:59.880
Yeah, from what I hear,
it wasn't too bad of a hike.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.048
My parents got married
next to a waterfall.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.691
My dad likes to joke
he couldn't hear the vows.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.770
Anyway, we're thinking
somewhere up on Mount Hood.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.924
Don't worry,
somewhere we can drive.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.363
Well, That...

04:18.839 --> 04:21.684

04:21.760 --> 04:23.888
to the ulterior
motive for tonight.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.290
I want to thank you

04:32.360 --> 04:34.124
for changing my life,

04:34.360 --> 04:35.964
because if it
hadn't been for you,

04:36.040 --> 04:37.963
I never would have met Rosalee,

04:39.360 --> 04:42.204

I am truly grateful.

have to answer right away.

Dude, you brought us together.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.846
I mean, you are kind of
the responsible party here.

the maid of honor,

05:32.240 --> 05:33.520
since you've never been married.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.847
Of course.
That means so much to me.

to be his best man, but...

I don't think
they're supposed to.

13:57.640 --> 14:01.247
No one's taking this as real.
They all think it's a trick.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.011
Now, every so often,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.447
something appears
that is so horrible,

14:07.760 --> 14:10.604
so vicious, it cannot be tamed.

14:11.120 --> 14:14.522
For this beast is
the demented turmoil

14:14.600 --> 14:16.125
of man himself,

14:16.680 --> 14:20.241
hidden from view
until it is too late.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.084
Do not be fooled by
the way he looks now.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.446
Show us. Show us what you are.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.521
Show us!

14:39.480 --> 14:42.131
I command you to show us!

15:10.000 --> 15:11.286
He's dead.

15:12.840 --> 15:16.049
Let this be a warning to you,
ladies and gentlemen,

15:16.480 --> 15:20.849
that there are monsters
amongst us in the world.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.963
Beware. Beware.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.724
Isn't this where
Sebastien left us?

15:51.840 --> 15:54.525
Yes. I was hoping it's the
last place they look.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.930
Wait, what are you gonna do?

16:02.200 --> 16:03.565
We need a car.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.040
Stay here.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.571
I'm gonna get you to a doctor.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.368
No, no, you must go.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.601
Yes.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.810
For helping me?

(SIGHS)

17:50.040 --> 17:51.041
What are you doing?

17:51.400 --> 17:52.606
Making up for what I've done.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.200
Stay in the car.
We're leaving.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.727
I'm not. They will
have heard the shots.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.321
Give me his gun.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.487
Go.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.685
We're just gonna leave him?

18:23.440 --> 18:25.283
He's doing what he has to do.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.280
MAX: Listen,
this is a great idea.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.566
You just should
have let me go with it.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.051
You should have let
me go into the crowd.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.485
I could've just...
Max, please.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.125
Get right in their face...
Enough!

18:47.560 --> 18:50.723
This is my show.
No one tells me what to do.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.728
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

18:55.080 --> 18:56.081
You?

19:00.080 --> 19:01.081
You?

19:04.240 --> 19:05.526
We have company.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.207
I'm sorry,
no one's allowed back here.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.521
I'm detective Griffin.
This is detective Burkhardt.

19:10.760 --> 19:11.761
You Hedig?

19:11.840 --> 19:13.842
The one and only.
Is there a problem?

19:14.440 --> 19:17.489
We're investigating the death of two
women who were here last night.

19:17.880 --> 19:18.927
You recognize 'em?

19:20.920 --> 19:23.730
Don't remember them, no.
Sorry.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.805
Look, we'd love to help,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.240
but we perform in front of
a lot of people every evening.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.970
You can't expect us to remember
two faces out of a crowd.

19:38.680 --> 19:42.002
This is a nice trick
you guys do onstage.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.286
Want to tell me how you do it?

19:43.960 --> 19:44.961
Magic.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.765
Really?
Gentlemen,

19:46.960 --> 19:49.122
it's how we earn a living.
Illusion's important.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.487
Without it, we'd be
left with what? Reality.

19:51.960 --> 19:55.726
And as you know, reality
can often be not very pretty.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.603
And I assure you, whatever
magic we do in the show

19:59.880 --> 20:01.120
did not kill those women.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.805
We're gonna need a list
of all your employees.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.724
Of course, yes, yes.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.610
My records are in my trailer.
Would you like to follow me?

20:12.560 --> 20:13.971
Max, did...

20:19.400 --> 20:20.447
NICK: How long
you been doing this?

20:20.560 --> 20:21.760
HEDIG: Ever since I was a kid.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.490
I ran away from
home when I was 13,

20:23.560 --> 20:26.530
even though it wasn't much
of a home to run away from.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.485
I worked for
the man who started this,

20:28.560 --> 20:32.849
Major William John Beeman.
He was a real performer.

20:32.960 --> 20:34.280
I bought it from
him 10 years ago.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.722
Ever have problems
with your employees?

20:36.800 --> 20:39.121
Of course, it's
the nature of our business.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.002
Here's the list of
all the people that work here.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.847
Now, just because
some of my people

20:45.920 --> 20:47.081
have been in
trouble in the past,

20:47.160 --> 20:49.481
it doesn't mean to say
they're in trouble now.

20:50.680 --> 20:54.162
You know, those masks you use,
they seem so real.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.280
It's all part of the illusion.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.971
You make them?

20:58.080 --> 20:59.525
No, they're made in China.

20:59.680 --> 21:03.162
It's a tradition that goes back
4,000 years of mask making.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.045
These people are real craftsmen.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.691
Thank you for your time.
If we need anything else?

21:10.760 --> 21:14.048
Please.
We are here through Sunday.

21:30.880 --> 21:33.724
Please tell me you don't know
what happened to those girls.

21:34.640 --> 21:36.051
I don't remember.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.209
It's just...
Answer me.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.368
All I remember is drinking
with them, that's all.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.211
That's not all.
They're dead.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.725
I don't remember.
I don't remember.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.644
Hedig is working you too hard.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.245

about any of us.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.765

23:04.960 --> 23:06.007
He didn't mean it!

23:06.080 --> 23:07.650
He didn't know
what he was doing.

You idiot,
you'll be the ruin of us all.

23:18.760 --> 23:21.809

can't go on stage like this.

24:14.960 --> 24:15.961

24:16.040 --> 24:17.804
Ever been to one?
No.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.531
It's not something the community
is particularly proud of,

24:20.600 --> 24:22.170
but they still exist.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.050
They aren't as
common as they used to be,

24:24.120 --> 24:28.728
but it goes all the way back to Rome,
from Circus Maximus to P.T. Barnum.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.928
Long history of
Wesen exploitation.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.642
Forcing Wesen from
all over the world

24:33.720 --> 24:36.166
to woge for the cheap thrill
of a paying audience.

24:36.280 --> 24:38.806
Which is offensive
on so many levels.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.082
Well, the Council doesn't have
a problem with that?

24:41.720 --> 24:44.166
The performers present it
as one big magic trick,

24:44.240 --> 24:47.323
so it technically doesn't go
against the Code of Swabia,

24:47.400 --> 24:50.609
but in situations like this,
it's recommended

24:50.680 --> 24:54.366
that local Wesen perform
a sort of intervention.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.726
Why?

24:56.360 --> 24:59.170
The real danger isn't
the exploitation of Wesen.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.129
It's the umkippen.

If we force ourselves to woge
over and over again,

25:12.200 --> 25:15.090
the Wesen side can,
like, take over.

25:18.280 --> 25:21.250
Leaving us at
the mercy of our primal urges,

25:21.320 --> 25:23.891
which is a little problematic
for civilized society.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.163
If someone in this show is
suffering from the umkippen,

25:27.520 --> 25:29.090
they are a ticking time bomb.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.446
And they could've
killed the two victims.

25:30.640 --> 25:31.721
Absolutely.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.808
Why do you think it was
one of these performers?

25:34.360 --> 25:36.567
They got pretty tight-lipped
when we started asking.

25:36.880 --> 25:39.645
The Blutbad seemed a little
more worked up than the others.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.327
Now, if someone did
have this umkippen,

25:42.400 --> 25:43.561
would you be able to tell?

25:43.680 --> 25:44.806
Eventually, yeah.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.123
Look, when there's not
a shred of humanity left,

25:47.200 --> 25:49.441
it's pretty obvious.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.086
And in the meantime, it's a
pretty intense struggle.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.200
Could there be a pattern
of violent behavior?

25:54.800 --> 25:55.801
Yes.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.321
We gotta get to the precinct and do
some background checks. Thank you.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.721
You got it.

26:04.640 --> 26:05.880
We should check that place out.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.401
What? No... Why?

26:08.600 --> 26:10.240
I hate carnivals,
they give me the creeps.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.481
But we would be able

26:11.560 --> 26:13.562
to tell if someone is
suffering from the umkippen.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.847
If they are, they need our help.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.684
Even if they've killed somebody?

26:18.160 --> 26:19.160
Then, we tell Nick.

26:19.200 --> 26:22.727
Okay, why don't we just
bring Nick with us, at least?

26:23.600 --> 26:26.843
Because he's a Grimm. It would
only make things worse.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.247
Fine.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.367
RENARD: How many? NICK:
Four murders, three years,

26:36.440 --> 26:37.851

26:37.960 --> 26:39.610
Checked the carnival's
show dates.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.206
Each murder took place when
the carnival was in the area.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.169
How far back did you track it?

26:44.240 --> 26:45.446
We're working on it.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.204
We're gonna get a subpoena
to get the earlier records.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.327
If they even keep them.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.801
The problem is the employees
don't last very long.

26:50.920 --> 26:53.446
Some of them, couple years,
others, a few weeks.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.808
And they've all been arrested, everything
from disorderly conduct to assault.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.803
Except this guy, he's been there

26:58.880 --> 27:00.928
for all four murders,
and he's Blutbaden.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.530
RENARD: Max Robbins.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.722
A couple of DUls
doesn't make him a murderer.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.685
Where was he before
he joined the carnival?

27:06.760 --> 27:09.650
Don't know yet, still waiting for
the IRS to give up his tax returns.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.764
The carnival packs
it up in two days.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.002
If we don't charge somebody,
they're gone.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.491
If we charge someone
without sufficient evidence

27:15.560 --> 27:16.925
to hold them,
they may disappear for good,

27:17.000 --> 27:20.925
so you've got two days to make
sure you find something solid.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.765

We need to talk with
one of the performers.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.128

the others will know.

they'll talk to us.

I'm not disturbing you.

Why?

28:04.200 --> 28:05.929
Because we're simpatico.

No simpatico.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.882
What do you think you're
doing back here? Uh...

28:19.960 --> 28:21.485
Auditions are in the tent.
Hurry up, let's go.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.125
We don't have a lot of time.
Whoa, wait a minute!

28:23.200 --> 28:25.123
Look, I don't have a minute, okay?
You wait out front.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.645
She gets the part,
you get a free pass.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.484
Turn around.
Let's go, come on.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.081
Let's go.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.640
Hello?

28:47.880 --> 28:50.042
HEDIG: Show us what you got,
bright eyes.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.164
I'm sorry, I...

28:54.480 --> 28:55.811
I don't know what you want.

28:55.920 --> 28:58.002
HEDIG: Woge for me,
or get out.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.850
Do we have all day?
No, we don't.

28:59.920 --> 29:03.481
There's a show to do,
so let's see it.

29:10.280 --> 29:14.171
Great. Turn around.
Go ahead.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.171
Keep going.

29:18.880 --> 29:22.601
Keep going.
Keep going.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.040
Keep going.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.524
(CLAPPING)

29:32.080 --> 29:33.525
Brilliant.

29:33.600 --> 29:38.322
You are hired,
and you're working tonight.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.762
What am I supposed to do?
What you just did.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.451
Don't sweat it, Genvieve
will fill you in on the rest.

29:43.760 --> 29:46.366
Sid, take her to the tent.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.522
Welcome to show business.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.802
I'm gonna make you a star.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.728
Come on, sweetheart. Come on.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.486
(CHUCKLING)

30:15.720 --> 30:17.848
You made the Verrat
turn the gun on himself.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.770
I was trying to
make him drop it.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.964
I'm still a little rusty.

30:25.760 --> 30:26.886
Thanks.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.126
You're welcome.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.731
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

30:32.720 --> 30:34.006
Yes?
How close are you to Zurich?

30:34.080 --> 30:35.411
MEISNER: About half an hour.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.168
Tavitian found someone to
transport Adalind and the baby.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.242
Do we know who?
No.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.926
But if Tavitian set it up,
they can handle it.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.923
Where are they taking them?
I don't know.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.162
I'm gonna send you coordinates
to an airstrip north of Zurich.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.886
Get there as soon as you can.
The plane won't wait.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.291
And...

30:52.480 --> 30:53.561
Tell her to be careful.

30:56.160 --> 30:58.128
Sean found somebody
to take you and the baby out.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.723
You aren't coming with us?

31:02.200 --> 31:03.964
No. My fight is here.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.601
Here's your new bunkmate.

31:15.720 --> 31:19.964
What? Hedig wants you to get
her ready for the show.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.086
Make it quick.

31:26.840 --> 31:27.841
(SIGHS)

31:28.520 --> 31:29.601
Hi.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.605
I'm Rosalee.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.130
Good for you.

31:34.320 --> 31:37.449
Costume's hanging right there.
Get ready.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.449
What am I supposed to do?

31:40.320 --> 31:41.481
You're a Fuchsbau, right?

31:41.560 --> 31:42.561
Yeah.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.290
Ever been on the stage?
(LAUGHS)

31:45.080 --> 31:46.491
Not since I was eight.

31:46.560 --> 31:47.561
What were you doing?

31:47.640 --> 31:50.246
Sound of Music.
Oh. That'll help.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.680
What happened to your leg?

31:54.840 --> 31:57.002
I fell on some broken glass,

31:57.080 --> 31:58.525
which is why you're here.
Get ready.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.161
This is it?

32:09.840 --> 32:12.605
Look, you seem like a nice girl,

32:12.680 --> 32:14.921
and I'm sure joining a carnival
looks like a lot of fun,

32:15.000 --> 32:16.684
but let me just
tell you right now,

32:16.760 --> 32:18.250
you do not want to be here.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.527
Is that because of the umkippen?

32:22.640 --> 32:24.130
What do you know about that?

32:24.200 --> 32:26.009
I know that it can be dangerous.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.771
Then walk away
while you still can.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.769
This is no life for a Wesen.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.170
Has it affected you?

32:35.480 --> 32:37.209
You ask a lot of questions.

32:37.440 --> 32:39.488
I don't mean to pry,
it's just that

32:39.600 --> 32:41.523
if we don't look out
for each other, then...

32:41.720 --> 32:43.449
It's affected all of us.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.085
Why don't you quit?
I can't.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.804
Maybe I can help you.

32:46.920 --> 32:48.524
It's not me.

32:48.720 --> 32:49.721
Then who?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.490
My boyfriend, Max.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.000
He's in the show?

32:55.640 --> 32:58.723
He's the star of the show,
Hedig's biggest attraction.

32:58.880 --> 33:00.086
(SIGHS)

33:00.720 --> 33:02.131
You must love him a lot.

33:03.160 --> 33:05.561
Hedig pushes him too hard.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.130
I'm scared for him.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.206
I'm scared for me.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.084
Okay, where's Max now?

33:13.440 --> 33:16.205
Quit asking questions.
Get dressed.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.486
If Sid comes back here
and you're not ready,

33:17.560 --> 33:18.971
he's going to tear into me.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.241
Go.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.648
What the hell are you doing?
Get outta here!

33:32.720 --> 33:34.449
No, I can't leave, Monroe,

33:34.520 --> 33:35.806
it is so much
worse than we thought.

33:35.920 --> 33:37.001
What?

33:37.080 --> 33:38.320
It's Max.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.929
Who's Max?
From the show.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.207
He's the one suffering
from the umkippen.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.806
Oh, my God,
why is it always the Blutbad?

33:46.400 --> 33:47.731
That is not cool.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.520
That is even more
reason to get out of here.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.369
You are not safe.
SID: Where is she?

33:51.480 --> 33:53.520
SID: Is she dressed? It's show time.
Go, go, go, go.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.604
No time to be shy, honey.
Get in that costume.

33:57.720 --> 33:58.801
You're on in 10.

34:06.280 --> 34:07.520
Something doesn't make sense.

34:07.600 --> 34:08.726
What do you got?

34:08.800 --> 34:11.371
Three more unsolved homicides
going back 10 years,

34:11.440 --> 34:13.568
all towns the carnival
has gone through,

34:13.639 --> 34:15.679
only Max hasn't been with
the carnival for 10 years.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.324
Well, none of them have.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.565
Except...

34:20.280 --> 34:21.281
NICK: Hedig.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.608
MAX: Where is Genvieve?

34:35.679 --> 34:39.161
Because I'm not gonna do this.
I'm not going on without...

34:40.560 --> 34:41.891
Where's...
Where's Genvieve?

34:41.960 --> 34:43.563
She's hurt, remember?

34:47.520 --> 34:49.362
So, you think that
you can take her...

34:50.679 --> 34:52.523
(GROWLING) Don't push me!

35:00.720 --> 35:02.688
You don't go
anywhere near the new girl.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.364
You hear me? Get in the cage.

35:04.440 --> 35:05.805
Get in the cage!

35:12.960 --> 35:14.689
And take a good
look at these bars,

35:15.000 --> 35:16.240
'cause that's where you'd be
if it wasn't for me

35:16.320 --> 35:17.970
cleaning up your messes.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.282
You can't treat me this way.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.609
I own you. I can
treat you any way I want.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.570
If I hadn't stopped those girls

35:26.640 --> 35:28.369
or any of the others
from calling the cops,

35:28.480 --> 35:30.369
what do you think
would've happened?

35:30.840 --> 35:32.683
It was...
You killed those girls.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.731
Well, that doesn't matter.

35:35.200 --> 35:40.570
What matters is who the cops think killed
them, and right now, all things point at you.

35:43.520 --> 35:45.010
It's all a show,

35:45.720 --> 35:47.722
and it's been going on
a lot longer than you,

35:47.800 --> 35:49.165
so shut up and do your job!

35:49.240 --> 35:50.241
Places, everyone.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.369
He can't go on. He's sick.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.087
We all are, sweetie.
Come on.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.651
Everyone,

36:05.600 --> 36:07.250
have a great show.

36:10.680 --> 36:12.921
MONROE: Come on,
come on, pick up.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.081
NICK: Monroe.

36:14.160 --> 36:17.687
Hey, Nick. Remember that
carnival we talked about?

36:18.320 --> 36:20.846
Yeah, well, Rosalee and I
thought we'd, you know,

36:20.920 --> 36:23.002
check it out for ourselves,
and I think we might have

36:23.080 --> 36:24.650
gotten in a little
over our heads here.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.125
You're at the carnival?

36:26.440 --> 36:28.761
Yes, and the umkippen issue
is worse than we thought.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.211
You need to get
the hell out of there.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.282
I know, but see, that's where

36:33.360 --> 36:36.603
the "in over our heads" part
comes in, 'cause...

36:36.680 --> 36:39.206
Rosalee kind of got herself
put into the show.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.691
What?

36:40.800 --> 36:42.643
But we found out who's got the
umkippen, and you were right,

36:42.760 --> 36:43.921
it's the Blutbad, Max.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.763
We're almost there.
Good.

36:46.840 --> 36:48.126
(WHIP CRACKING) I gotta go.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.202
HEDIG: A warning, my friends.

36:50.280 --> 36:54.808
What you're about to see will
live in your fear for years,

36:55.120 --> 36:57.566
for this is no nightmare,

36:57.640 --> 37:01.725
and truth truly is
stranger than fiction.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.368
Oh, my God.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.723
Behold Damien, the last of the
dragons on God's green Earth,

37:07.800 --> 37:11.930
whose ferocious nature
proves that we are lucky

37:12.040 --> 37:14.486
they did not devour us all.

37:21.880 --> 37:25.123
Witness the vile Ivan.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.844
The beautiful Rosalee,

37:36.480 --> 37:39.689
who proves that
beauty is but skin deep

37:39.760 --> 37:42.650
and that a beast
resides within us all.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.451
HEDIG: Rosalee...

37:46.680 --> 37:47.806
Show us.

37:49.640 --> 37:50.971
Rosalee!

37:51.200 --> 37:52.201
(SNARLING)

37:54.760 --> 37:56.410
Max, this is not your cue.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.321
(MAX SNARLING)

38:05.080 --> 38:07.845
But every so often,
something appears

38:07.920 --> 38:11.049
that is so vicious, so
terrible, it cannot be tamed.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.288
For this beast,

38:13.360 --> 38:14.646
this beast...

38:14.720 --> 38:15.721
(GROWLING)

38:16.880 --> 38:18.006
Back!

38:18.080 --> 38:19.411
Get back!

38:19.800 --> 38:20.801
(GUNSHOT)

38:21.400 --> 38:22.447
Get out!

38:24.040 --> 38:26.566
I don't think
that's part of the show.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.723
Max! Oh, my God, no!

38:29.840 --> 38:31.330
Max, stop!

38:31.680 --> 38:33.170
(AUDIENCE SCREAMING)

38:37.600 --> 38:39.250

38:43.240 --> 38:44.241
(SCREAMING)

38:45.520 --> 38:47.045
Move!

38:50.040 --> 38:51.451
(GROWLING) Grimm!

38:58.680 --> 39:00.045
Monroe, stop!

39:00.240 --> 39:03.210
No, stop! Stop, he's sick.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.604
We have to help him.

39:12.280 --> 39:15.284
Oh, my God.
What happened? What did I do?

39:15.680 --> 39:18.604
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.450
You're gonna be okay.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.248
(CRAZED LAUGHTER)

39:45.400 --> 39:47.402
DISTORTED VOICE: Hedig.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.081
Hedig.

39:54.320 --> 39:55.651
Hedig.

39:58.920 --> 40:01.127
The cop, he's a Grimm.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.440
He'll kill us all.
You need to get me out.

40:03.680 --> 40:05.330
You pushed Max too hard.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.291
And you were going to
let him take the fall

40:08.360 --> 40:10.362
for something you did.

40:11.440 --> 40:14.569
And we can't let you
get away with that.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.610
I did it for you.

40:17.640 --> 40:19.244
I did it for all of you.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.324
You'd be gutter
trash without me.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.649
I gave you a life.
I gave you purpose.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.443
I gave you a family.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.844

40:47.880 --> 40:50.200
RENARD: Well, it may not be
justice in the eyes of the law,

40:50.560 --> 40:52.760
I don't think that would matter
to the people he killed.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.840
Close it.
Nothing we can prove here.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.961
I called the place
you recommended.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.690
They've got a bed
waiting for Max.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.645
How's he doing?

41:06.720 --> 41:08.600
We're gonna make sure
he gets the help he needs.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.005
It's gonna take some time.

41:10.160 --> 41:12.731
If we don't take care
of each other, who will?

41:19.680 --> 41:20.681
Thank you.

41:53.800 --> 41:54.926
Rosalee?

41:56.240 --> 41:59.005
ROSALEE: In the bathroom.
I'm getting dressed.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.691
Getting dressed for what? I
thought we were going to bed.

42:08.440 --> 42:09.441
Not yet.
