ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S BEEN SHOT.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.208
- YEAH.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.546
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.648
- BACON.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.756
[crunching]

08:11.859 --> 08:14.327
LET'S DO IT.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.170
- MAEVE'S IN.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.371
SHE'S MEETING US THERE.
- PERFECT.

08:24.404 --> 08:25.806
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
- [laughs]

08:25.839 --> 08:28.809
[cell phone rings]

08:28.842 --> 08:30.711
- YEAH?
- HEY, YOU ALONE?

08:30.744 --> 08:31.879
- NO, WHOLE GANG'S HERE.
WHY?

08:31.912 --> 08:33.380
- PUT YOUR POKER FACE ON.

08:33.413 --> 08:34.548
- OH.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.487
I AM LADY GAGA, BABY.
WHAT'S UP?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.155
- THERESA AND I
ARE GETTING MARRIED.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.891
- WHAT?
- POKER FACE, ASSHOLE!

08:43.924 --> 08:45.826
- OKAY, YES.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.227
NO, I-I KNEW THAT ALREADY.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.429
SHE HAD TOLD ME
WHEN WE GOT BACK TO--

08:49.462 --> 08:51.999
I'M LADY GAGA AGAIN.
WHAT THE HELL?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.366
- OKAY, I NEED YOU TO MEET US

08:53.400 --> 08:55.335
AT THE COURTHOUSE
ON WEST WASHINGTON.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.704
DON'T TELL ANYBODY. DON'T RUSH
OUT THE DOOR LIKE A MANIAC.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.438
JUST BE COOL.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.240
- IS THIS PAYBACK
FOR THE SKIN-CREAM PRANK?

09:00.273 --> 09:01.541
- TELL HANK IT'S NOT PAYBACK.
- IT'S NOT PAYBACK.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.210
- GOD DAMN.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.112
- LADY GAGA, PLEASE,
NOT A PEEP.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.614
AND WHEN YOU LEAVE,
TAKE BRIAN WITH YOU,

09:06.647 --> 09:07.948
SO NOBODY GETS SUSPICIOUS.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.951
- 10-4.
- NOT A WORD TO ANYONE--NO ONE.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.586
- OH, YOU AIN'T GOT
TO WORRY, BROTHER.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.789
I AM CIA ON THIS BITCH.

09:15.823 --> 09:18.391
- WHAT'S UP?

09:18.425 --> 09:19.927
- SO WE CAN'T GET MARRIED
FOR AT LEAST 24 HOURS?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.561
- NO.
MAYBE IT'S A SIGN.

09:21.595 --> 09:22.930
- THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO IT?
- NO!

09:22.963 --> 09:24.097
THAT WE SHOULD GO
TO VEGAS AND DO IT.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.365
- SORRY WE'RE LATE, BRO.
- HEY.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.700
- LOOK, THEY FIGURED OUT
SOMETHING WAS UP

09:26.734 --> 09:27.935
WHILE I WAS TALKING TO YOU.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.202
- I THOUGHT YOU
HAD YOUR POKER FACE ON.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.537
- IF THAT WAS HIS POKER FACE,

09:30.570 --> 09:31.772
WE GOT TO START PLAYING
SOME GODDAMN CARDS

09:31.805 --> 09:33.106
AROUND THE DEPOT, MAN.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.942
- DID WE MISS EVERYTHING?
- NO--

09:34.975 --> 09:36.576
- JESUS, MAEVE,
YOU CALLED BILLY?

09:36.610 --> 09:38.445
- I COULDN'T GO TO A WEDDING
WITHOUT A DATE.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.814
- WAIT. THIS IS A DATE?
HELL, YEAH.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.616
HEY, I'M ALL BETTER NOW,
THERESA.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.151
- WE GOT SEVEN WITNESSES
AND NO WAY TO GET MARRIED.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.919
- YEAH, THE LAW SAYS
WE HAVE TO WAIT 24 HOURS.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.655
- WAIT, I GOT A WAY. MY UNCLE
RUNS A CHURCH ACROSS TOWN.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.289
IT'S PENTECOSTAL.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.891
- YOU THINK HE'D DO IT?
- REALLY?

09:50.924 --> 09:52.826
- HE'LL DO ALMOST ANYTHING
IF YOU GOT THE CASH.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.394
I'LL CALL HIM REAL QUICK.
- WHAT'S THIS WITNESS BULLSH--?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.163
- WE NEED TWO WITNESSES.
- I KNOW THAT, ASSHOLE.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.564
YOU GOT A SH--LOAD
OF WITNESSES.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.266
I NEED A TITLE, BRO,
LIKE BEST MAN.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.500
- NO, WE'RE NOT DOING
ALL OF THAT.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.135
- NO.
- HEY, WHEN YOU SAID

10:02.169 --> 10:03.904
TWO YEARS AGO YOU WAS THINKING
ABOUT GETTING MARRIED,

10:03.937 --> 10:05.138
THAT HANDS DOWN, I WAS
THE ONLY CHOICE FOR BEST MAN.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.139
- YOU STILL ARE.
- YOU WERE THINKING

10:06.173 --> 10:07.908
ABOUT MARRIAGE TWO YEARS AGO,

10:07.941 --> 10:09.509
AND YOU DIDN'T THINK
TO SAY ANYTHING TO ME?

10:09.542 --> 10:10.944
- IF HE GETS TO BE BEST MAN,
I'M MAID OF HONOR.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.112
- NO, WE'RE NOT
DOING THAT SH--, MAEVE.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.947
- THAT WAS JUST IDLE CHAT.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.783
WE WERE JUST BULLSH--TING
IN THE RIG ONE DAY, YOU KNOW?

10:15.816 --> 10:17.084
- CAN I BE A GROOMSMAN?
- IDLE CHAT ABOUT MARRYING ME?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.752
- BABE, NOT RIGHT NOW.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.253
- CAN WE BE BRIDESMAIDS?
- I LOVE THAT MOVIE.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.521
- HEY, YOU SAID "BULLSH--TING."

10:21.554 --> 10:22.790
SO WERE YOU BULLSH--TING
ABOUT MARRYING ME?

10:22.823 --> 10:24.291
- HEY, HOW ABOUT USHERS?

10:24.324 --> 10:25.793
YOU GOT GROOMSMEN.
HOW ABOUT A COUPLE USHERS?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.094
- DOES THIS LOOK
LIKE I'M BULLSH--TING YOU?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.428
- I DON'T KNOW.
YOU TELL ME.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.263
- BUT THERE WON'T BE
ANYONE TO USH.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.498
- IT'S NOT ABOUT WHO I USH
OR WHO I DON'T USH.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.200
IT'S ABOUT THE POSITION.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.802
- TWO SECONDS AGO, YOU WANTED
TO THROW IN THE TOWEL.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.670
- BULLSH--.
WHEN?

10:36.704 --> 10:38.438
- I AM THE BEST MAN.
BRIAN, YOU'RE THE GROOMSMAN.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.140
- YES!
- I THOUGHT WAITING 24 HOURS

10:40.173 --> 10:41.608
WAS A POSITIVE SIGN.
YOU THOUGHT

10:41.641 --> 10:42.876
IT WAS A NEGATIVE SIGN.
- NO.

10:42.910 --> 10:44.477
- WHAT'S BILLY GONNA BE?

10:44.511 --> 10:45.946
- BILLY SHOULD BE AN USHER.
- STEP OFF, BITCH.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.715
I AM THE BEST MAN.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.049
I'M THE BOSS OF ALL THE MEN
IN THE WEDDING PARTY,

10:49.082 --> 10:50.784
NOT THE GROOMSMAN.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.986
BILLY IS AN USHER.
- WE SHOULD GET DRESSES.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.855
- NO! WE'RE NOT GETTING
DRESSES, MAEVE!

10:54.888 --> 10:56.824
- THEN I'M THE HEAD USHER.
- THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF YOU!

10:56.857 --> 10:58.191
- I'M NOT HAVING EQUAL BILLING

10:58.225 --> 10:59.893
WITH SOME DIM-WITTED
SPECIAL-ED REJECT.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.161
NOW, EITHER I'M THE HEAD USHER,

11:01.194 --> 11:02.730
OR I AIN'T
NO GODDAMN USHER AT ALL.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.364
- [speaking Spanish]

11:04.397 --> 11:05.532
OKAY, YO, HE SAID
HE'S GONNA DO IT, Y'ALL.

11:05.565 --> 11:06.900
[all cheering]
- REALLY?

11:06.934 --> 11:07.968
- SO HE'S GOT
AN OPENING IN AN HOUR,

11:08.001 --> 11:09.703
BUT WE GOT TO BE ON TIME,

11:09.737 --> 11:11.004
BECAUSE HE HAS
AN EXORCISM RIGHT AFTER THAT.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.472
AND IT'S GONNA
BE 200 BUCKS CASH.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.007
- 200 BUCKS?
- WHAT KIND OF CHURCH IS THIS?

11:14.041 --> 11:15.175
- IT'S CALLED
IGLESIA PENTECOSTAL

11:15.208 --> 11:16.209
ESPIRITU SANTO DE KOSTNER.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.645
- COSTNER--
AS IN KEVIN COSTNER?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.013
- HOLY SH--,
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.715
NAH, THAT'S JUST
THE STREET THAT IT'S ON.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.050
- OKAY.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.484
- BUT MY UNCLE
REALLY DID LIKE TIN CUP.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.020
CHEECH MARIN, YO--
THAT MAN IS RIDICULOUS.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.860
- BILLY,
DON'T START CRYING AGAIN.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.828
- OKAY, KOSTNER STREET,
EVERYBODY, LOCK AND LOAD.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.329
T AND I ARE GONNA STOP
AT THE CASH MACHINE.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.766
THIS--HONEY, THIS IS
A POSITIVE SIGN, RIGHT?

11:38.799 --> 11:40.033
- MM-HMM.
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.701
- OKAY.
- LET'S GO.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.904
- COME ON, WHAT DO YOU--
- NOW IT'S GONNA BE A WEDDING.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.005
WE GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME.
- WHAT KIND OF CHURCH IS THIS?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.373
- THIS IS GONNA BE
A GOOD WEDDING!

11:46.406 --> 11:47.674
- WHAT KIND OF CHURCH?
- THEY GOT SOME KIND

11:47.707 --> 11:49.009
OF EXORCISM.
DON'T NOBODY KNOW.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.277
LOOK, WE GONNA DO THIS RIGHT.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.045
- THEY COULD HAVE CHICKENS
FOR USHERS, MAN.

11:52.079 --> 11:52.813
- CHICKENS?
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT NO CHICKEN.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.552
- WHAT?

11:59.586 --> 12:01.955
- HEY, DID MAEVE BLAB THIS
TO YOU GUYS?

12:01.989 --> 12:03.223
- YES, BABY.
OH, MY GOD.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.258
CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.961
- YES, YES, CONGRATULATIONS
MY ASS, OKAY?

12:07.995 --> 12:09.930
IF YOU THINK THAT MY DAUGHTER
IS MARRYING THIS KID

12:09.963 --> 12:12.199
IN THIS FLEABAG FAKE
FRIGGIN' CHURCH,

12:12.232 --> 12:13.200
YOU'RE ALL OUT
OF YOUR GODDAMN MINDS.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.802
- LANGUAGE, JERRY.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.136
- I DIDN'T SAY
SH--HOLE, BRIDGET.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.070
- DAD!
- EXCUSE ME, SIR.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.605
MY CHURCH IS FULLY LICENSED.

12:18.638 --> 12:19.940
- YEAH, BY WHO?
THE PUERTO RICAN

12:19.973 --> 12:21.975
COCKFIGHTING ASSOCIATION?
- STOP IT.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.077
- THE JOINT'S A DUMP, PADRE.
- HEY, STAY OUT OF THIS, MIKE.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.645
YOU STAYED OUT OF OUR LIVES
FOR 15 YEARS.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.280
WE MANAGED JUST FINE.
- MA!

12:27.314 --> 12:29.482
- HEY, ME AND JOHNNY MADE UP.
YOU KNOW, I APOLOGIZED.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.418
NOW WE TALK, AND WE HANG OUT.
WE DO STUFF.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.787
WE'RE LIKE, UM, UH--
- FATHER AND SON?

12:33.821 --> 12:36.223
- VERY FUNNY, I WAS THINKING
MORE LIKE STARSKY AND HUTCH.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.958
LISTEN, KID,
WE GOT TO THINK THIS OVER.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.492
- LET ME TAKE A PICTURE.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.760
I'VE GOT ONE
OF THOSE NEW SMARTPHONES.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.329
- IT'S NOT UP TO YOU, HUTCH.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.563
- IT SURE AS HELL
AIN'T UP TO YOU, PAL.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.832
- GET CLOSER TOGETHER.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.133
- WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

12:46.166 --> 12:47.667
- CLOSER, SCRUNCH IN.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.836
- IT MEANS THAT MY DAUGHTER'S
A TEN, BIGFACE.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.603
- BIGFACE?
- YOUR FACE IS HUGE.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.906
THIS IS NEWS TO YOU,
SECRETARIAT?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.441
- LET ME GET IN, FATHER.
- SURE.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.009
- SCRUNCH IN, SCRUNCH IN.
SAY "CHEESEBURGER."

12:56.043 --> 12:57.310
- YOU ADD TO THAT THE FACT
THAT SHE'S A HERO COP...

12:57.344 --> 12:59.279
- CHEESEBURGER.
- THAT'S A 13.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.314
AND SHE'S MARRYING WHAT?

13:01.348 --> 13:04.017
THIS GUY WHO'S WHAT?
MAYBE--NOT FOR NOTHING--A FOUR?

13:04.051 --> 13:05.752
- YOU ASSHOLE.
MY SON AIN'T NO FOUR.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.987
- YEAH, YOU TELL HIM.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.621
HE'S AT LEAST A FIVE.
- WHAT?

13:08.655 --> 13:10.190
WELL, ADD THREE POINTS
'CAUSE HE'S AN E.M.T.,

13:10.223 --> 13:12.125
AND THAT MAKES HIM AN EIGHT.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.793
YOUR DAUGHTER'S A TEN, MINUS
TWO POINTS FOR BEING A COP.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.295
- WHAT?
- THAT MAKES HER AN EIGHT TOO.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.297
SO IT ALL EVENS OUT HERE.
- I'M CONFUSED.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.932
WHY IS SHE LOSING TWO POINTS?

13:18.966 --> 13:20.300
- 'CAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT EVERY FIREFIGHTER AND COP

13:20.333 --> 13:22.369
HAVE IN COMMON?

13:22.402 --> 13:24.004
THEY BOTH WANT
TO BE FIREFIGHTERS.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.605
[laughter]
- OKAY, THAT'S--

13:25.638 --> 13:27.274
- THAT'S FUNNY.
- LET'S--LET'S NOT--

13:27.307 --> 13:28.675
- ONE MORE.
- MOM, COME ON.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.477
- COME ON, EVERYBODY, COME ON.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.711
- QUICK, QUICK, QUICK, QUICK,
LET'S JUST GET IT DONE.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.346
- SCRUNCH IN.
- ONE MORE, EVERYONE IN.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.315
- HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN
A FIREFIGHTER HAS PASSED AWAY?

13:35.348 --> 13:37.617
HE DROPS THE REMOTE CONTROL.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.887
- OH, THAT'S ENOUGH!
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

13:39.920 --> 13:42.489
- PLEASE STOP!
- HEY, GUYS, LISTEN UP, HEY!

13:42.522 --> 13:43.823
- THE WEDDING--
- HEY, LISTEN!

13:43.857 --> 13:45.058
THIS IS OUR DAY...
- RIGHT.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.526
- NOT YOURS.
- RIGHT.

13:46.559 --> 13:47.727
- AND I AM MARRYING
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

13:47.760 --> 13:49.629
WHO IS NOT A 4 OR A 5.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.231
HE IS A FRICKIN' 15.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.665
- OH!
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

13:52.699 --> 13:53.901
- WELL, YOU WERE NEVER
TOO GOOD AT MATH, HONEY.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.236
MY CHIN IS SO WEIRD IN THIS.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.305
WE NEED ONE MORE.
FATHER, JUST ONE MORE.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.373
ONE MORE, THANK YOU.
- HEY, WHERE'S CASH AND THEM AT?

14:00.407 --> 14:01.841
- THEY'RE SEATING
ALL THE GUESTS.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.510
both: GUESTS?

14:03.543 --> 14:04.844
- YEAH, THERE'S, LIKE,
35 PUERTO RICANS IN THERE.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.914
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

14:06.947 --> 14:07.981
- HERE AT THE IGLESIA DEL
ESPIRITU SANTO DE KOSTNER...

14:08.015 --> 14:08.982
- COME ON, LET'S GO.
- FINE!

14:09.016 --> 14:10.750
- ONE MORE!

14:10.783 --> 14:12.319
MY NECK LOOKED FUNNY.
- WE HAVE TO GET IN THERE.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.753
- WE LIKE TO FILL THE PEWS.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.256
IT MAKES THE OCCASION
MUCH MORE JOYOUS.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.025
[camera shutter clicks]

14:18.058 --> 14:20.193
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
YOU HAVE THE $400?

14:20.227 --> 14:21.828
both: WHAT?
- I THOUGHT IT WAS $200.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.931
- 200 FOR THE SERVICE,
200 FOR THE JOY.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.865
- CAN WE GET
AN ITEMIZED RECEIPT FOR THIS?

14:25.899 --> 14:27.600
- I ONLY HAVE $200.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.336
DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY MONEY?
- UM...

14:29.369 --> 14:31.104
- DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I AIN'T THE FATHER OF THE BRIDE.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.205
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ME FOR?

14:32.239 --> 14:33.740
- GET IN THERE!

14:33.773 --> 14:35.242
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, MR. KELLY.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.044
- HE'S A COP.
HE AIN'T USED TO THIS.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.512
USUALLY WHEN CASH CHANGES HANDS,
HE'S ON THE RECEIVING END.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.181
- HEY, I HEARD THAT, PAL!
[overlapping shouting]

14:41.214 --> 14:42.715
YOU WANT TO START WITH ME?

14:42.749 --> 14:45.352
- NO, DAD!
- YOU'LL BE LOCKED UP, PAL!

14:45.385 --> 14:46.186
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

14:46.219 --> 14:47.420
- ABSOLUTELY.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.888
- LOOK, I JUST NEED YOU
TO KNOW--

14:48.922 --> 14:50.423
I GOT THE RIG GASSED UP
AND READY TO GO.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.791
WE CAN THELMA & LOUISE
THIS SH-- RIGHT NOW.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.426
- NOT NECESSARY, BRO.
I'M GOOD.

14:53.460 --> 14:54.928
- OKAY.
- YOU REALIZE THEY DIE

14:54.962 --> 14:56.196
AT THE END OF THAT MOVIE,
RIGHT?

14:56.229 --> 14:57.897
- WHO GIVES A SH--?
BRAD PITT LIVED.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.232
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

14:59.266 --> 15:00.467
- THIS IS
YOUR BEST MAN SAVING...

15:00.500 --> 15:02.069
- [gasps]
- YOUR SORRY WHITE ASS.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.104
- IS THIS REAL?
- $8,000 REAL.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.406
- AAH!
HOLY SH--.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.375
JESUS, HANK--
- I ADVISE AGAINST IT.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.310
- LOOK, THREE MONTHS' SALARY
IS A NORMAL AMOUNT OF MONEY

15:10.343 --> 15:11.311
TO SPEND ON A WEDDING RING,
NUMBNUTS,

15:11.344 --> 15:13.213
FOR SOMEONE YOU TRULY LOVE.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.048
- THERESA'S NOT REALLY
AN $8,000-RING KIND OF GIRL.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.749
THAT'S WHY I LOVE HER.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.986
- DOES SHE HAVE TITS?
- SHE'S GOT FABULOUS TITS.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.287
- THEN WATCH AND LEARN,
ASSHOLE.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.888
- HOLY SH--!

15:21.921 --> 15:23.123
[gasps]
IS THAT REAL?

15:23.156 --> 15:25.125
- YES, IT IS.
- OH, MY GOD!

15:25.158 --> 15:26.960
I LOVE YOU!
- OH, GOD.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.262
- MOM, LOOK AT THIS RING!
- OH, MY--OH, MY GOD!

15:29.296 --> 15:32.232
- AW.
IT'S AMAZING.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.068
I KNOW MORE ABOUT PUSSY THAN
YOU TWO DIPSH--S PUT TOGETHER,

15:35.102 --> 15:37.237
AND I AIN'T EVEN SEEN ONE
SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.107
- WHO'S IN THE LIMO?

15:44.211 --> 15:47.447
- OH, SH--. WAIT. WHO IS THAT?
IS THAT THE DRIVER?

15:47.480 --> 15:49.849
- OH, MY GOD, MAEVE!

15:49.882 --> 15:52.185
YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
- THANKS. HI.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.486
- OH.
- OH, MY GOD.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.022
LET ME GET A PICTURE.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.456
SAY "CHEESEBURGER."
- CHEESEBURGER.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.025
- CHEESEBURGER.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.960
- WHO'S THE DRIVER?
- MY SON RAMON.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.596
WE RUN A WEDDING STORE,
AS WELL AS THE CHURCH.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.432
- YOU GOT 'EM
COMING AND GOING, HUH?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.335
I GOT MY EYE ON YOU,
FATHER DAMIEN.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.437
- RAMON GOT US A GREAT DEAL.
- IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.172
BESIDES,
WHEN I SAW THIS TUX,

16:12.205 --> 16:13.940
I THOUGHT,
"BILLY! BILLY, BILLY!"

16:13.973 --> 16:17.144
[laughter]

16:18.578 --> 16:20.547
- WE'RE CATHOLIC,
AND I'M SO GLAD

16:20.580 --> 16:22.482
TO SEE A CHURCH
THAT ACCEPTS THE GAYS.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.952
- RAMON IS NOT GAY.
HE'S CREATIVE.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.188
- YOU CALLED MOM AND DAD?

16:28.221 --> 16:31.524
- I WANTED 'EM TO SEE ME
IN THIS DRESS.

16:31.558 --> 16:32.892
- I SAID NO DRESSES, MAEVE.

16:32.925 --> 16:36.129
- OH, MY GOD, THERESA,
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.731
- HA!
- THAT IS SO SMALL...

16:38.765 --> 16:41.668
JUST LIKE MY ASS
IN THIS HOT LITTLE DRESS.

16:41.701 --> 16:45.038
[chuckles]
WHO'S GOING TO FAT CAMP NOW?

16:46.539 --> 16:49.576
- HEY, I'M SORRY, T.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.517
- * HE IS GATHERED
HERE AMONG YOU *

16:57.550 --> 17:00.353
* AT THE CALLING
OF YOUR HEARTS *

17:00.387 --> 17:04.224
* REST ASSURED
THIS TROUBADOUR *

17:04.257 --> 17:07.060
* IS ACTING ON HIS PART

17:07.094 --> 17:10.230
* THE UNION
OF YOUR SPIRITS HERE *

17:10.263 --> 17:13.233
* HAS CAUSED HIM TO REMAIN

17:13.266 --> 17:16.436
* FOR WHENEVER
TWO OR MORE OF YOU *

17:16.469 --> 17:18.538
* ARE GATHERED IN HIS NAME

17:18.571 --> 17:22.275
* THERE IS LOVE

17:22.309 --> 17:23.543
[trembling]

17:23.576 --> 17:25.878
* EL HOMBRE DEJA SU MADRE *

17:25.912 --> 17:29.749
* Y LA MUJER DEJA SU CASA *

17:29.782 --> 17:35.222
* LOS DOS JUNTOS VAN A IR
HACERSE UNA PERSONA *

17:35.255 --> 17:37.124
THAT MEANS YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA BE ONE.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.225
[crying]

17:38.258 --> 17:41.194
[rooster crows]

17:41.228 --> 17:44.264
[sniffling]

17:44.297 --> 17:46.399
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.869
JOHNNY, MAN,
I JUST LOVE YOU, MAN.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.572
- I LOVE YOU TOO, BILLY.
- THANKS, BILLY.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.642
- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME,
I WILL KEEP MY REMARKS BRIEF.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.444
WE GATHER TODAY
TO WITNESS THE JOINING

17:57.477 --> 17:59.879
OF TWO LOVING PEOPLE

17:59.912 --> 18:03.783
AS THEY EMBARK
ON THE JOURNEY OF MARRIAGE.

18:03.816 --> 18:08.087
IT HAS BEEN SAID
BY ONE GREATER THAN ME,

18:08.121 --> 18:10.457
"WHEN A DEFINING MOMENT
COMES ALONG,

18:10.490 --> 18:12.592
"YOU MUST DEFINE THE MOMENT,

18:12.625 --> 18:16.062
OR THE MOMENT
WILL DEFINE YOU."

18:16.095 --> 18:19.266
- ISN'T THAT FROM THE MOVIE
BULL DURHAM?

18:19.299 --> 18:21.634
- NO, TIN CUP, WHEN COSTNER'S
TALKING TO CHEECH MARIN.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.270
- NO, IT'S BULL DURHAM.
- TIN CUP.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.504
- SHH!

18:24.537 --> 18:27.440
- "I BELIEVE IN THE HEART.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.442
"I BELIEVE IN THE SOUL.

18:29.476 --> 18:34.447
"I BELIEVE IN LONG, SLOW,
DEEP, SOFT, WET KISSES

18:34.481 --> 18:37.417
THAT LAST FOREVER AND EVER."

18:37.450 --> 18:39.519
- THAT'S BULL DURHAM,
HORSEFACE.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.088
- [grunting like a horse]

18:42.121 --> 18:43.490
- QUIET.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.192
- DO YOU, JIMMY FARRELL...
- JOHNNY.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.327
- TAKE THIS WOMAN, THERESA,
TO BE YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE,

18:47.360 --> 18:49.962
TO HAVE AND TO HOLD
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH?

18:49.996 --> 18:52.599
- I DO.
- AND DO YOU, THERESA KELLY,

18:52.632 --> 18:56.369
TAKE THIS MAN, TOMMY, TO BE
YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED HUSBAND,

18:56.403 --> 18:58.471
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH?

18:58.505 --> 19:02.342
- YES, JOHNNY, I DO.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.378
- IF THERE IS ANYONE AMONGST YOU
WHO KNOWS OF ANY REASON

19:05.412 --> 19:08.014
WHY THERESA AND DONNY

19:08.047 --> 19:10.283
SHOULD NOT BE JOINED TOGETHER...
[rooster crows]

19:10.317 --> 19:13.320
SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER
HOLD YOUR PEACE.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.121
- OH, I DO.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.524
THERE'S AN ENTIRE BARN'S WORTH
OF FIGHTING BIRDS

19:17.557 --> 19:19.892
LOCKED UP DOWN IN THE BASEMENT

19:19.926 --> 19:21.894
AND A FULLY EQUIPPED
COCKFIGHTING RING,

19:21.928 --> 19:24.397
AND YOU, FATHER JULIO,
ARE UNDER ARREST.

19:24.431 --> 19:27.033
- AY, DIOS!
- WHAT?

19:28.235 --> 19:30.169
- RAMON!

19:30.203 --> 19:32.872
MARICON!
- W-W-W-WHOA.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.975
- [gasping in pain]
- OH, NO, NO!

19:36.008 --> 19:37.877
[concerned chatter]
- HEY, BRIAN, GET THE A.E.D.

19:37.910 --> 19:41.180
- OH, OH, OH! AH!
- THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT!

19:41.214 --> 19:42.315
EVERYONE
OUT OF THE GODDAMN WAY!

19:42.349 --> 19:44.417
[rooster crows]

19:44.451 --> 19:47.687
[sirens wailing]

19:47.720 --> 19:51.358
- VITAL SIGNS
STABILIZING FAST.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.059
- HE'S CONSCIOUS.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.994
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL
WITH US, PADRE,

19:55.027 --> 19:56.496
'CAUSE YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

19:56.529 --> 19:58.765
FOR RUNNING
AN ILLEGAL GAMBLING OPERATION.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.233
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT,

20:00.267 --> 20:01.668
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.236
- THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THIS PHONE.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.438
I DON'T HAVE BAGS
UNDER MY EYES.

20:05.472 --> 20:08.007
- SO WHAT EXACTLY
DO WE CALL OURSELVES NOW, HMM?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.276
ENGAGED?

20:09.309 --> 20:12.245
STILL ON A BREAK
FROM EACH OTHER? WHAT?

20:12.279 --> 20:13.780
- HOW ABOUT ROOMMATES?

20:13.813 --> 20:15.748
- YOU'RE GONNA MOVE IN WITH ME?
- MM-HMM.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.584
- YOU CAN COMMIT TO THAT?

20:17.617 --> 20:20.753
- YEAH, 'CAUSE I LOVE YOU.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.422
AND BASED ON THE PRICE
OF THAT RING,

20:22.455 --> 20:24.123
I CAN'T REALLY AFFORD TO LIVE
BY MYSELF ANYMORE, SO...

20:24.156 --> 20:26.058
- LOOK, SO SHINY.
- [laughs]

20:26.092 --> 20:29.396
- I'D SAY VISIT ME
IN PRISON...

20:29.429 --> 20:33.466
BUT I'LL PROBABLY BE JUGGLING
A FEW GUYS BY THEN.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.635
[siren wailing]

20:35.668 --> 20:38.070
- I DON'T SEE WHAT
THE HOOPLA IS ABOUT A RING.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.907
ANYBODY CAN GO TO A MALL
AND WALK OUT WITH A RING.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.875
BUT IT TAKES
A SPECIAL KIND OF MAN

20:42.909 --> 20:45.778
TO FIND THE SEVERED DIGIT
OF A REAL, LIVE PERSON,

20:45.812 --> 20:47.647
CAREFULLY PACKAGE IT UP,
CARRY IT ACROSS THE CITY,

20:47.680 --> 20:50.383
AND PRESENT IT AS A GIFT
TO ANOTHER REAL, LIVE PERSON,

20:50.417 --> 20:52.719
LIKE YOU DID FOR ME.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.954
THAT WAS VERY, VERY DEEP.

20:54.987 --> 20:58.291
IT CREATES A UNIQUE
AND LASTING BOND.

21:02.595 --> 21:06.165
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T PROCURE YOU
ANY MORE BODY PARTS, RIGHT?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.736
- NORTH CICERO'S
GONNA BE JAMMED,

21:09.769 --> 21:11.604
SO MAYBE CUT DOWN WEST KINZIE
TO SOUTH CENTRAL.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.606
- BABE, I DRIVE FOR A LIVING.
I THINK I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.408
- AND I DON'T?

21:15.442 --> 21:17.444
CUT DOWN KINZIE.
- I'M NOT CUTTING DOWN KINZIE.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.446
- OH, I AM GOING TO THROW THIS
GODDAMN RING OUT THE WINDOW.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.647
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- CUT DOWN KINZIE!

21:20.680 --> 21:22.615
- I'LL CUT DOWN KINZIE.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.317
THERE. HAPPY NOW?

21:24.351 --> 21:26.853
- YEP. [laughs]
- OH, SH--.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.788
IT'S WIDE OPEN.
- SUCKER.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.957
- YOU WERE RIGHT.
- TAKE A LEFT ON LARAMIE.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.925
- I WILL. I WAS GONNA.
- NO, YOU WEREN'T.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.461
- I ALWAYS
TAKE A LEFT ON LARAMIE.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.795
- YOU NEVER TAKE LARAMIE.
- LARAMIE IS MY STREET.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.296
I SHOWED YOU LARAMIE!
- OH, REALLY?

21:37.330 --> 21:39.699
- I'VE KNOWN LARAMIE FOR YEARS.
YOU KNOW THAT.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.468
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE
ALL YOUR STUFF.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.470
WHEN DO YOU WANT TO MOVE?

21:43.503 --> 21:44.837
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT TO ANYMORE.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.439
I'M JUST KIDDING.
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.376
