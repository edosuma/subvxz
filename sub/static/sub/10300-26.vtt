01:16.040 --> 01:18.110
Last week on Married With Children:

01:18.360 --> 01:22.512
Al and Bud were being hunted
by killers from two different towns...

01:22.760 --> 01:26.673
...each wanting to kill them
in their respective villages.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.480
Bud was warned by some new friends.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.950
You will die in the morning.

01:32.200 --> 01:36.796
And if things aren't bad enough,
their only hope of rescue is Kelly.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.229
Marcie and Jefferson have sought
salvation elsewhere.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.829
Bad Americans.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.196
And for you Buck fans...

01:47.440 --> 01:51.228
Would it have killed them to pay
an extra dollar so I could eat?

01:51.440 --> 01:54.591
And now,
Married With Children continues.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.234
Hang them high
Hang them high

01:57.440 --> 01:59.749
Hang them till they thirst and die

01:59.960 --> 02:02.110
Hang them high
Hang them high

02:02.320 --> 02:04.754
Hang them till they thirst and die

02:06.320 --> 02:11.917
I welcome you all here on this
wonderful Lower Uncton afternoon...

02:12.120 --> 02:17.114
...to witness the deaths
of the hated Bundy males.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.117
Their excruciating deaths
will usher in...

02:22.320 --> 02:26.836
...a new era of prosperity
and sunlight...

02:27.040 --> 02:29.679
...on this peaceful village.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.593
Kill! Kill! Kill!

02:32.840 --> 02:35.479
Kill! Kill! Kill!

02:35.680 --> 02:36.999
Listen to them, Peg.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.716
They're chanting "Al, Al, Al."
Just like my old Polk High School days.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.229
These people have been so nice.
During my speech...

02:44.440 --> 02:46.271
...I'm throwing in
an old football story.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.914
Why don't you tell them about
your 3.25 an hour?

02:49.120 --> 02:51.156
That'll wow them.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.794
You're just jealous because
I'm a god here.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.309
Watch this.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.070
How do you like that, babe?

03:02.280 --> 03:07.229
They'll stop screaming when you lower
your arms, Al. Most people do.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.000
Heavy is the head that
wears your mother, son.

03:10.200 --> 03:13.078
Dad, don't you sense
there's something wrong here?

03:13.280 --> 03:16.078
I'm not talking about the ghosts
who danced around my room...

03:16.280 --> 03:18.510
...removing their heads
and telling me to get out.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.190
I mean, haven't you noticed
it's daytime and yet there's no sun?

03:23.520 --> 03:25.397
Time to go.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.515
Sorry, madam, no women allowed.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.279
Well, thank God they don't have
that attitude in Paris.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.918
Son, I could die
a happy man right now.

03:38.120 --> 03:42.716
Al Bundy, have you any words
for the assembled villagers here?

03:51.160 --> 03:53.594
My people...

03:54.280 --> 04:00.833
...today I feel like the luckiest man
on the face of the earth.

04:02.160 --> 04:05.869
As you know,
I played high school football.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.515
I was great.

04:08.720 --> 04:13.999
And I know you kids out there would
like to be just as great as I was...

04:14.200 --> 04:15.838
...but beware.

04:16.440 --> 04:20.149
There's a killer out there.
A temptation.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.397
It infests your country
the same as mine.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.912
It'll eat up your money
and your will to live.

04:28.120 --> 04:33.069
I know you've heard about it before,
but you can't hear about it enough.

04:33.280 --> 04:38.718
Kids, please just say no to marriage.

04:39.640 --> 04:42.473
Dad, I've got a gut feeling
they're gonna kill us.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.113
I'm trying to talk here, son.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.711
- Football builds men.
- Enough of this football drone.

04:48.920 --> 04:49.989
Kill them!

04:50.200 --> 04:55.069
Kill them. Kill them.
Kill them. Kill them.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.874
Son, I'm beginning to think
you were right.

05:00.080 --> 05:03.436
Forsooth, woodsmen,
spare those men.

05:03.640 --> 05:07.838
Fear not, Daddy, there's no business
like show business.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.476
Hi-yo Silverware, away!

05:23.640 --> 05:25.835
Well, I just saved
your worthless hides...

05:26.040 --> 05:29.271
...and I think I deserve a hearty
"Good job, Kelly, thank you."

05:29.480 --> 05:31.277
You might have gotten
a nice thank you...

05:31.480 --> 05:34.517
...if you didn't say we'd travel faster
if we lightened the load...

05:34.720 --> 05:36.472
...then unhitched the horse.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.716
Well, he did go faster, didn't he?

05:38.920 --> 05:42.151
So should we,
because here they come.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.589
Kill the Bundys! Kill the Bundys!
Kill the Bundys! Kill the Bundys!

05:48.800 --> 05:52.554
Kill the Bundys! Kill the Bundys!
Kill the Bundys! Kill the Bundys!

06:10.280 --> 06:11.998
They've stopped.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.713
We must be safe.

06:13.920 --> 06:17.549
Well, we are safe.
A man told me to bring you here.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.678
What man?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.877
That man...

06:22.320 --> 06:26.438
...holding a gun and pointing it at us
with a whole load of townspeople.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.588
Don't worry, Al.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.473
Whatever happens,
I'll be right by your side.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.837
The women are free to go.
We only want to kill the men.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.515
Have a nice life, Al.

06:41.040 --> 06:45.352
I hope your death is less painful
than your life. Bye, Daddy.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.679
Hey.

06:48.680 --> 06:52.309
Come over to our side.
Your death will be quicker.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.596
No. Come to our side.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.394
At least we won't eat you afterwards.

06:57.640 --> 07:01.838
That is an ugly rumour
started by people who are jealous.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.709
Besides, it's dark over here.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.276
We couldn't tell.
It's hard to know what we're eating.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.110
- Why aren't they killing us, Dad?
- I don't know, son.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.114
We must be on the borderline.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.669
Right, then. I'll settle this.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.918
Now then, come over here
or your wife and daughter are through.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.709
You fool, that didn't work
with the other Bundys, either.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.593
All right, we'll just wait them out.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.631
Thank you.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.076
It was really nice
meeting you. Thanks.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.718
Thanks.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.275
Thanks for such a good time.

07:49.480 --> 07:53.439
Now, you really must come to America
and experience our theatre.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.312
Jefferson, come on.

08:01.080 --> 08:04.834
I'm sick of the theatre, Marcie.
Let's go get something to eat.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.594
There's a place across the street.
The Whipped Puppy.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.471
Sounds good to me.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.875
Now listen, I have wired my mother
for money...

08:13.080 --> 08:14.957
...but this was
the only address I had...

08:15.160 --> 08:17.230
...so I guess we'll just
have to sit and wait.

08:17.440 --> 08:21.399
But that could take hours. What are
we gonna do in the meantime?

08:21.640 --> 08:23.517
Bad Americans?

08:24.520 --> 08:26.078
Bad Americans.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.239
Dad, I just want to say
it was brave of you to say:

08:41.440 --> 08:43.874
"Take me and let the boy go free."

08:44.640 --> 08:46.437
I didn't say that, son.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.677
Don't you think it would be
a good time to do it?

08:50.040 --> 08:51.632
Why would I say that?

08:51.840 --> 08:55.071
What better way to die
than with my only son?

08:55.440 --> 08:57.032
I love you, Dad.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.671
Yeah, right.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.634
But I feel this is the right time
for a final father-son chat.

09:03.840 --> 09:08.072
Great. Much better than
my dream of dying in the saddle.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.477
Don't make me push you
off the borderline.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.511
I won't be able to die in peace...

09:13.720 --> 09:18.032
...until I've been able to pass down
the accumulated wisdom of my lifetime.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.073
So listen, son, and listen good.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.758
Never mind.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.752
We're getting nowhere.

09:27.960 --> 09:31.396
Let's just beat them with clubs and
see which side they collapse on.

09:31.640 --> 09:37.078
Oh, no. What if one of them fell your
side and one of them fell our side?

09:37.280 --> 09:39.236
Be in a fine pickle then,
wouldn't we?

09:39.960 --> 09:42.997
I'm sure we could work out
something mutually beneficial.

09:43.240 --> 09:44.593
Oh, right.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.758
We have them killed on your side
and you promise to share.

09:47.960 --> 09:51.589
But you won't, will you?
You can't trust a light-dweller.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.553
- Moon people.
- Sun people.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.394
Maybe we're taking rather
a narrow view of this.

09:57.600 --> 10:02.469
Maybe we should be looking at it from
the point of view of true entrepreneurs.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.148
All right, look, it's the grave
of the Bundy...

10:05.360 --> 10:09.956
...whose death ended
a 400-year-old curse.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.478
That's gotta be worth a little bit.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.392
- Custard sales.
- Right.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.312
Banners.

10:16.520 --> 10:20.559
"My Dad saw Al Bundy killed and all
I got was this lousy T-shirt" T-shirts.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.193
I love it.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.994
- Partners.
- Partners.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.873
Peace has been found
after all these years.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.718
Kill them.

10:33.960 --> 10:38.192
Wait, wait, guys, before you shoot,
I just want to say one thing.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.879
The blond over there is a boy.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.797
Come on.
It's not that dark over here, lad.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.597
Well, excuse me.

10:47.800 --> 10:52.078
While we're all in such a jovial mood,
may I offer just a little suggestion?

10:52.280 --> 10:53.952
See, I think a great idea would be...

10:54.160 --> 10:56.355
...pretending to have killed
the last Bundy.

10:56.640 --> 11:00.110
Yes, well, I'm sure something
could be worked out.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.276
I mean, we're not barbarians.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.232
We're not the French.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.993
Well, I demand vengeance.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.272
Shamus McBundy insulted
my great-great-great-grandmother...

11:09.480 --> 11:12.472
...and I want revenge.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.271
Hey, I'll buy you an Orange Julius
in London, buddy.

11:16.520 --> 11:17.873
That's a brilliant idea. Okay.

11:18.080 --> 11:23.473
Igor, you kill the big one and in a
typical rush of English bloodlust...

11:23.680 --> 11:26.797
...we all kill the rest of them.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.435
Wait a second. That's not fair.

11:30.640 --> 11:34.110
I was once a mighty athlete
and I demand to go out like a man.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.636
All right. What about
a medieval joust?

11:37.840 --> 11:41.037
Just think
of the promotional possibilities.

11:41.240 --> 11:45.438
Buttons. Fanny packs.
Videotapes for the spectators.

11:45.680 --> 11:50.800
Hey, Igor. Before you kill him,
try and do something funny with him.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.719
Then we can sell a separate
wacky blooper reel.

11:53.960 --> 11:57.509
Oh, Al, do it. I love those.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.479
A medieval joust it is then.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.238
They will fight to the death
in Upper Uncton.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.078
Why Upper Uncton?

12:07.320 --> 12:11.393
Well, we could hardly film ever
in your village, now could we?

12:13.160 --> 12:14.559
Was that another "dark" crack?

12:14.800 --> 12:18.759
Let's not get testy.
We've got a man to kill.

12:22.360 --> 12:25.511
- AI, I'm afraid.
- Don't worry, babe.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.757
This Igor don't look too tough to me.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.076
Well, it's not him I'm worried about.

12:31.320 --> 12:36.110
They're gonna be filming and I left
my bright-sun makeup in the castle.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.674
And you guys thought you were cursed.

12:48.040 --> 12:51.794
I can't believe my life depends
on Dad's ability to joust.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.833
Well, it's better that than
his ability to earn a living.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.635
And besides, who says
Igor's any good at this jousting stuff?

13:28.960 --> 13:31.633
So long, Tiny Toon.

13:32.640 --> 13:36.030
Come on, Al. It's time to go.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.231
What could that man
be doing in there?

13:38.440 --> 13:40.749
I think he's getting
into his battle gear.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.717
Let's joust.

14:08.680 --> 14:12.116
Al, honey, before your death...

14:12.680 --> 14:15.513
...I mean, certain victory...

14:15.720 --> 14:18.439
...there's really something
that I must say to you.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.392
What is it, babe?

14:21.200 --> 14:23.111
Do you have our return tickets?

14:23.320 --> 14:27.518
You know, just in case you lose them
during your victory dance.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.551
Don't worry about me, babe,
I played high school football.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.478
Besides, if I should die...

14:33.680 --> 14:37.309
...it will comfort me greatly to know
you'll be stuck here for life.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.268
Wish me luck, kids.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.115
What good would it do?

14:43.360 --> 14:45.157
Pumpkin, what do you have to say?

14:46.440 --> 14:48.954
Daddy's dying.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.191
Well, that's comforting.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.837
Let the tournament commence.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.751
Pennants. Get your Igor pennants.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.191
Get your "I saw Al Bundy die"
T-shirts.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.153
Here you are, sir, one for the lady wife.
Here you go.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.237
A couple for the kiddies.
Lovely, smashing.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.953
That's it.

15:16.440 --> 15:21.070
Ladies and gentlemen...

15:21.280 --> 15:26.195
...let's get ready to rumble!

15:28.920 --> 15:33.072
Welcome to the thumping
in Upper Uncton.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.314
On my left...

15:37.520 --> 15:44.073
...five-time all-European
undefeated jousting champion...

15:44.280 --> 15:46.271
...going by the name of...

15:46.480 --> 15:52.112
...Igor "The Truth" Deathshire.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.599
And on my right...

16:00.640 --> 16:04.189
...from the Windy City of Chicago...

16:04.600 --> 16:06.716
...USA...

16:07.640 --> 16:13.192
...AI "Stink-foot" Bundy.

16:18.760 --> 16:22.548
When I say begin, begin.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.188
Begin.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.713
Go back to England, Igor.

17:34.840 --> 17:38.719
- I can't look. How's he doing?
- He's doing great.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.235
What do you mean,
Dad's doing great?

17:44.440 --> 17:47.432
Dad? I thought you meant Igor.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.113
Okay.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.990
Enough Rope-a-Dope.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.075
Let's rock.

18:02.360 --> 18:06.433
Now for the death blow.

18:10.280 --> 18:16.230
Next time you play a man's game,
wear a man's uniform.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.872
And the next time you insult
an American...

18:22.080 --> 18:25.117
...make sure he didn't play
high school football.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.309
Now let's rock.

18:43.560 --> 18:45.949
You stink, Bundy.

19:05.520 --> 19:09.354
You did it! You did it!
It was so great.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.073
- Oh, Al.
- Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.508
What do we do now?

19:14.760 --> 19:18.878
Well, I suppose we'll just have to flip
a coin to see which side we kill him on.

19:19.120 --> 19:23.910
Look, it's the sun.
It's coming out over Lower Uncton.

19:29.440 --> 19:33.433
The curse must have been lifted
when Bundy defeated Igor.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.274
Hooray for Al Bundy!

19:37.040 --> 19:38.951
Oh, Al.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.678
This is terrible.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.872
We've always prospered
as a tourist attraction.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.675
"The town next to the land
of darkness." Now we have nothing.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.309
What about us? I mean,
now you can see. Look.

19:53.520 --> 19:57.069
We've got no crops.
There's no paint on the stores.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.278
We're just a couple of little burgs
in the middle of nowhere.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.471
We can't sell any T-shirts now.

20:02.720 --> 20:06.952
We can't even sell
the bloody video we made.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.832
He's ruined everything, he has.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.640
- Let's kill him.
- Why not?

20:11.840 --> 20:14.354
Let's kill the whole bloody
lot of them.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.276
Vacation's over.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.113
Thank your father, kids.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.390
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks, Dad.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.596
Americans coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse us.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.233
- Americans coming through.
- Move.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.919
- Excuse us. Excuse us.
- Move.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.712
- Excuse us.
- Excuse me, pardon me.

20:44.920 --> 20:48.071
Americans coming through.
Excuse us... Oh!

20:48.280 --> 20:50.396
- Hi, you made it.
- Hi.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.672
- So how did you enjoy London?
- Oh, it was great, Peggy.

20:53.880 --> 20:58.476
We managed to take in
a lot of... theatre.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.078
Oh, my goodness.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.838
Someone has switched our luggage...

21:13.040 --> 21:16.077
...and given us many
erotic forms of punishment.

21:17.920 --> 21:22.869
But rather than hold these good people
up, we'll be glad to pay the duty.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.992
Do you have anything to declare?

21:33.240 --> 21:36.596
Yes. My husband is an idiot.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.833
- Come on, kids.
- Mom, what happened to Dad?

21:42.040 --> 21:47.160
He got caught stealing a hotel towel.
Like he'll ever use it.

21:47.360 --> 21:51.035
- What do you think they'll do to him?
- Oh, please, it's a hotel towel.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.798
What can they do?

21:59.160 --> 22:00.559
What are you in for?

22:00.760 --> 22:04.309
Stole an ashtray from the Ritz.

22:06.360 --> 22:09.716
- You?
- Towel from the Savoy.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.874
- What do they feed you in here?
- Bread and water.

22:19.480 --> 22:23.109
Then it's truly the best vacation
I've ever had.
