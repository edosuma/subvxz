The world
will have to deal with us.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.320
<i>Previously on The 4400...</i>

00:45.600 --> 00:47.080
I took the shot.
I'm fine.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.600
Mom, what's wrong?

00:48.720 --> 00:50.480
Someone help, please!
Mom!

00:50.760 --> 00:52.120
Isabelle's in Promise City.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.120
<i>As soon as she gets close
to Collier, she'll move.</i>

00:54.200 --> 00:55.520
<i>She knows
not to damage him, right?</i>

00:55.600 --> 00:57.360
For a while there,
I believed you'd changed.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.760
<i>- So did I.
- We're not gonna make you</i>

00:58.840 --> 01:00.360
a martyr to your cause, Jordan,

01:00.480 --> 01:02.440
we're going to make you
a traitor to it.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.360
<i>Once you're marked,
you'll single-handedly</i>

01:04.480 --> 01:05.800
<i>destroy the movement
you created.</i>

01:05.920 --> 01:08.480
I don't know what lessons you
took in bodysnatching school, but...

01:08.600 --> 01:10.000
you make
a terrible Tom Baldwin.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.680
If we really want to kill
that thing inside him,

01:12.760 --> 01:13.920
we're gonna have
to kill Tom, too.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.080
- Don't make me shoot you.
- You going to fix me, Diana?

01:16.160 --> 01:18.520
- Going to get your old Tom back?
- Goddamn it, Tom, stop!

01:32.400 --> 01:33.520
Oh, my god, Tom?

01:33.800 --> 01:35.320
He pulled a gun.
I had to fire.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.040
- Where's Shawn?
- He's waiting in the car. I'll get him.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.080
We can't do it here.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.000
He's in bad shape.
We have to move him.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.480
Uncle tommy?

01:45.600 --> 01:47.760
I need to heal him now.
He's losing blood too fast.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.000
Not yet.
That's not Tom.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.760
We need to get rid of that thing
inside of him first.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.680
- Everybody out.
- Here's the polonium...

01:55.760 --> 01:58.000
We need to inject it
directly into his spine.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.800
I can't lie to you, Tom,
this is going to hurt.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.040
But it's going to kill
that thing inside you.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.560
We lost pulse.

02:23.800 --> 02:24.920
Mom?

02:26.240 --> 02:27.840
Is she dead?
Is my mom dead?

02:27.960 --> 02:30.080
We don't know yet.
Sir, you need to let us work.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.200
You can wait inside.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.240
You did everything
you could.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.120
I think you need to prepare yourself
for some bad news.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.600
- Your mom's a textbook case.
- A textbook case of what?

02:46.040 --> 02:47.240
- Promicin death.
- No...

02:47.440 --> 02:49.000
She landed
on the wrong side of 50-50.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.440
My mom didn't take the shot!

02:53.080 --> 02:54.040
Are you okay?

02:54.600 --> 02:55.560
Sir?

02:58.160 --> 02:59.720
Are you okay? Help!
Wait... Sir!

03:15.480 --> 03:16.520
Come on, uncle Tom.

03:24.880 --> 03:25.840
Dammit!

03:28.320 --> 03:29.280
I can't.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.320
It's too late.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.360
I think I killed people.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.880
I think I killed people, Diana.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.760
We can talk about that later.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.920
Right now,
you need to rest.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.160
Don't know what happened.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.920
I was talking to the guy
and he collapsed.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.760
Kind of like what
happened with my mom.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.200
Mr. Farrell...

04:21.880 --> 04:23.200
I need some information.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.040
Do you know who your mother's
insurance carrier is?

04:26.160 --> 04:27.120
No.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.320
Ma'am?

04:31.680 --> 04:32.960
Oh, my god, ma'am!

04:50.800 --> 04:52.560
Somebody!

04:57.120 --> 04:58.080
Are you okay?

05:57.920 --> 06:01.120
[ www.seriessub.com ]

06:15.840 --> 06:16.960
What happened?

06:17.160 --> 06:18.680
I can barely
remember anything,

06:18.920 --> 06:20.840
And the few things I do,
they're all...

06:22.000 --> 06:23.080
They're all bad.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.800
How am I supposed to live
with what I did?

06:26.880 --> 06:28.800
How can I even be positive
that thing is gone?

06:28.920 --> 06:31.520
Well, we're going to
watch over you until we're sure.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.240
You're going to
recover yourself,

06:35.160 --> 06:37.640
and when you do,
you'll tell us who the Marked are.

06:37.720 --> 06:38.680
All of them.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.160
And after that,
whatever you did...

06:43.080 --> 06:44.680
We'll deal with it, okay?

06:48.480 --> 06:51.040
Nobody's getting into
or out of St. Ambrose.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.960
Seattle police have it
under strict quarantine

06:53.040 --> 06:55.040
and we have tactical agents
reinforcing them.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.280
No one knows exactly
what happened in there yet, but...

06:57.360 --> 06:59.680
I did manage to get on the phone
with a doctor who's trapped inside,

06:59.760 --> 07:01.640
and he has personally seen
dozens of deaths.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.520
How is that possible? There's no way
all those people took the shot.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.360
Maybe someone's going around
injecting patients, like...

07:07.640 --> 07:08.840
an orderly or a doctor.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.840
No, it'd take time to force the shot
on all those people.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.520
- This is spreading way too fast.
- What if it's a virus?

07:13.840 --> 07:14.960
You know,
someone took the shot,

07:15.040 --> 07:17.720
and the ability they developed
is to spread promicin like...

07:17.880 --> 07:18.840
I don't know, the flu.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.400
- God...
- Well, if that's true,

07:20.480 --> 07:22.720
we have more than just a bunch
of victims on our hands.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.040
50-50. For everyone who died
in that hospital,

07:25.120 --> 07:28.040
someone else survived, Someone
who'll develop a brand new ability.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.560
How many people do you think
are trapped inside that hospital?

07:31.240 --> 07:33.280
500?
1000?

07:33.520 --> 07:34.920
Whatever the number,
we'll deal with it,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
but at least there haven't been
any reports of deaths

07:37.080 --> 07:38.200
outside the hospital.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.240
Your brother danny's outside.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.760
Tell him to come in.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.320
I can't.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.080
He's out in the gardens,
and he won't come inside.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.360
It's a little strange,
to be honest.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.040
He's not letting anybody
near him.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.840
What's going on?
You're making everybody nervous.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.400
Everyone's dying, Shawn.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.120
- Everyone around me is dying.
- What are you talking about?

08:12.280 --> 08:13.320
That hospital?

08:13.800 --> 08:15.160
I killed all those people.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.360
Danny, what do you mean?
How? What?

08:17.480 --> 08:18.440
It's the shot.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.280
My ability.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.160
I think I'm infecting people
with promicin.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.840
And I don't know
what to do.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.600
I've been hiding out
all night in a park,

08:26.840 --> 08:29.400
and I can't even turn myself in
without making more people sick.

08:30.560 --> 08:33.600
Okay, you can't infect anyone
who's already promicin positive, right?

08:33.720 --> 08:34.720
I don't think so.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.760
So you're going to come inside.
I'm going to clear everyone else

08:36.840 --> 08:37.919
out of the building.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.640
Dr. Burkhoff can probably get his hands
on some of the inhibitor.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.280
Come inside.
We're going to suppress your ability.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.600
We'll figure this out together.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.280
Okay?

08:52.080 --> 08:53.040
Come on...

08:56.800 --> 08:57.840
Mom's dead, Shawn.

08:59.480 --> 09:00.440
What?

09:01.800 --> 09:02.960
It happened last night.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.200
It was my fault.
I killed her.

09:07.960 --> 09:08.920
I'm sorry, Shawn.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.640
I'm sorry.

09:11.720 --> 09:12.960
I didn't mean to hurt her.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.360
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.680
I wanted you to hear something
while you're still you.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.400
When Kyle brought me to you,
I wasn't lying.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.800
I really did want to change.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.560
I tried,

09:37.480 --> 09:39.440
but I'm not meant to lead
a normal life,

09:40.040 --> 09:41.680
and it was stupid
to think I could.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.400
Isabelle, everyone is in charge
of their own destiny.

09:45.040 --> 09:47.120
You may not have liked
the choices you had.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.160
Still, you made one.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.840
I was created to do a job.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.320
I fought it for a while, but...

09:54.560 --> 09:56.400
now I know
I have to do what they want.

09:59.000 --> 09:59.960
Kill me.

10:01.680 --> 10:02.760
Kill me right now.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.080
Don't let them use me
to end this movement.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.280
You were told
not to speak to Collier.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.360
Don't worry.
It won't happen again.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.240
Because I'm ready
to get out of here.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.560
You've got collier.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.640
I did what you asked me to do.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.680
Now you can let
my father go.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.040
No.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.480
Not yet.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.120
Your father will be released

10:32.240 --> 10:34.520
when everything's arranged
exactly as we want it.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.000
That is not what we agreed to.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.520
I don't really feel
like arguing about it.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.440
I like having
my abilities back.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.200
I'll go get
my father myself.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.120
I don't think so, Isabelle.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.320
I think you're forgetting.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.960
We took out a little
insurance policy on you

10:51.080 --> 10:52.160
while you were in prison.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.360
You remember that kill switch
that Tom told you about?

10:55.720 --> 10:57.200
You're feeling it right now.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.760
If you insist on disobeying us,
I won't hesitate to use it...

11:01.000 --> 11:01.960
Fully.

11:05.280 --> 11:08.200
<i>I wanna make a statement on behalf
of everyone who lives in Promise City.</i>

11:08.840 --> 11:10.040
We had nothing to do

11:10.760 --> 11:12.720
with the deaths
at St. Ambrose hospital.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.800
Forcing people to take promicin
goes against everything...

11:16.000 --> 11:17.760
Jordan Collier stands for.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.040
If Jordan were here,
he would tell you himself.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.160
But, unfortunately,
he is missing.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.760
He was abducted
by enemies of the movement.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.000
We are working to find him,
but while we do,

11:32.320 --> 11:34.200
we'd like to extend
a gesture of goodwill

11:34.280 --> 11:35.400
to the city of Seattle.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.120
The residents of Promise City...

11:39.680 --> 11:41.200
are already promicin positive.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.840
We're not vulnerable
to what's happening in the hospital.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.040
We'd like to offer our services
to the authorities.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.440
<i>We will not move out into the city
without an invitation,</i>

11:51.120 --> 11:52.960
<i>but we do stand ready
to help.</i>

11:53.920 --> 11:56.040
<i>All the government
has to do is ask.</i>

11:56.360 --> 11:59.040
So, ready to hand over
control of the city to Collier's army?

11:59.120 --> 12:00.640
We might need them
before this is over.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.560
I'm not sure, Meghan.
I didn't even know Collier was missing

12:02.640 --> 12:03.600
until just now.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.120
Has Tom been able
to tell you anything?

12:07.680 --> 12:10.920
Let me know if he starts to remember.
I'll call you if anything changes here.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.320
<i>Everything's gone silent
within St. Ambrose</i>

12:13.440 --> 12:15.440
<i>and we just had word
that authorities</i>

12:15.680 --> 12:18.200
<I>are considering sending in
the first relief team.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.200
How would you like to have
that job, huh?

12:20.280 --> 12:22.160
- How are things at the hospital?
- It's quiet.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.320
Whatever happened in there,
I think it's over.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.080
At least, the screaming has stopped.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.160
Guys...

12:27.720 --> 12:28.720
Look at this.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.800
<i>Authorities tell us that...</i>

12:41.200 --> 12:42.680
- What just happened there?
- I'm not sure.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.160
We need to talk
to the agents on site, right now.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.040
They told us
it was contained.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.360
Everybody,
get away from her!

12:55.960 --> 12:56.960
Get away from her.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.400
We need to
seal this place off, now!

13:03.120 --> 13:04.320
It's not fair.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.320
I didn't even take the shot.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.040
Ok! Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

13:20.140 --> 13:21.380
I was five feet from him...

13:21.980 --> 13:22.940
and I lived.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.340
It doesn't seem right.

13:25.340 --> 13:26.980
What's going to
happen to us now?

13:27.860 --> 13:29.500
I mean, everyone
who survived...

13:29.580 --> 13:31.420
are we going to
develop abilities?

13:33.980 --> 13:34.980
You two okay?

13:36.820 --> 13:38.140
What's going on out there?

13:38.340 --> 13:39.540
We're picking up the pieces.

13:40.540 --> 13:42.420
The worst is over,
for us, anyway.

13:43.420 --> 13:45.060
Someone must have gotten out
of that hospital

13:45.140 --> 13:46.380
and infected everyone
on the perimeter.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.980
The sickness is spreading
through the neighborhood

13:48.060 --> 13:49.060
near St. Ambrose.

13:49.260 --> 13:50.580
And the police,
emergency services,

13:50.660 --> 13:52.300
their people must have
brought the virus back

13:52.380 --> 13:54.420
from the barricade, too.
They've been devastated.

13:54.780 --> 13:56.260
So who's watching over the city?

13:56.340 --> 13:57.340
Right now, no one.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.420
The army has Seattle surrounded.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.700
The entire district
is under quarantine.

14:01.820 --> 14:03.660
How far is this thing
going to spread?

14:04.820 --> 14:06.260
We don't know.
But right now,

14:06.380 --> 14:09.660
I want to keep focused on this building.
Marco, we gave everyone promicin tests.

14:09.740 --> 14:11.860
- Have the results come in yet?
- Yeah, um...

14:12.380 --> 14:13.820
They're preliminary, but...

14:14.060 --> 14:16.020
It looks like everyone
who survived is positive.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.060
Except for one person.

14:19.420 --> 14:20.380
You.

14:20.900 --> 14:21.860
Me?

14:22.700 --> 14:23.660
Why?

14:24.500 --> 14:25.860
It's just a guess, but...

14:26.900 --> 14:30.620
you know, last year, Dr. Burkhoff forced
an early version of promicin on you.

14:30.860 --> 14:32.420
You didn't get an ability, but...

14:32.500 --> 14:35.700
it looks like your body developed
a resistance to promicin exposure.

14:35.780 --> 14:37.820
There's no chance
that I could infect anybody?

14:37.900 --> 14:39.580
No.
I mean, I don't think so.

14:41.820 --> 14:42.780
How do you feel?

14:43.380 --> 14:44.340
Tired.

14:44.460 --> 14:45.420
What did you give me?

14:45.980 --> 14:49.780
I included a sedative in the sample of
the inhibitor I mixed up.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.380
We won't know
if your ability's suppressed for...

14:52.700 --> 14:53.660
a few hours.

14:54.180 --> 14:55.140
I don't want to sleep.

14:55.780 --> 14:56.740
I want to help.

14:57.220 --> 14:58.740
There's nothing
you can do right now.

14:59.020 --> 15:00.380
Just close your eyes, buddy.

15:13.340 --> 15:14.740
Have you given any thought

15:14.980 --> 15:16.100
to what you want to do?

15:16.740 --> 15:18.140
I'm gonna give Danny to NTAC.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.420
I think I have to.

15:20.860 --> 15:21.860
I think so, too.

15:23.300 --> 15:24.580
They have to study your brother.

15:24.660 --> 15:26.780
He may be the only way
to find an antidote.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.580
Once the government has him,

15:28.700 --> 15:30.260
who knows
if they'll ever let him go.

15:30.740 --> 15:33.620
I don't want to lose my brother
and my mom on the same day.

15:40.820 --> 15:42.780
Jesus, my mom is gone...

15:51.580 --> 15:53.340
The virus got into city hall.

15:53.940 --> 15:55.740
The mayor's down,
half the city council,

15:55.820 --> 15:57.460
police, paramedics.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.660
People are abandoning
their posts in droves.

16:00.820 --> 16:02.740
I think we need to take
Kyle Baldwin up on his offer,

16:02.820 --> 16:04.860
see if his positives
can't restore some order.

16:05.020 --> 16:06.340
Are you ready
to cross that line?

16:06.460 --> 16:07.620
We don't have a choice.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.460
The federal government
is focused on containment.

16:09.580 --> 16:11.180
They're basically
writing Seattle off.

16:11.780 --> 16:12.980
We can't let that happen.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.540
I'm going to Promise City.

16:15.940 --> 16:18.100
Well, you can't just
drive across town. Let me go.

16:18.220 --> 16:20.140
I'm the one who's supposed to be
resistant to this thing.

16:20.220 --> 16:22.300
That's why you're going
to the 4400 center.

16:22.580 --> 16:23.620
You could be the key
to ending this.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.820
If someone could figure out
why you're not vulnerable,

16:25.940 --> 16:28.180
maybe they could replicate the effect
and create a vaccine.

16:28.260 --> 16:29.820
Okay, well,
we're not doing it,

16:29.900 --> 16:31.540
Because NTAC medical's
shut down.

16:31.620 --> 16:34.420
Shawn farrell is not developing
that compatibility test on his own.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.660
Someone is doing the research,
someone with a scientific background.

16:37.860 --> 16:39.060
Someone like Kevin Burkhoff.

16:39.580 --> 16:40.700
My sister's dead.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.540
That was shawn.
Susan was in that hospital. She's dead.

16:44.780 --> 16:45.860
Oh, my god, Tom.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.220
I'm so sorry.

16:50.140 --> 16:51.300
You should lie down.

16:52.660 --> 16:54.420
I can't imagine
what you're feeling now.

16:56.460 --> 16:57.900
No, no, I'll mourn later.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.460
Where'd you put my gun?

16:59.700 --> 17:01.060
I remember it all now.
Everything.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.500
The marked have Jordan Collier.
I know where they're keeping him.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.980
OK, tell us where he is,
and I'll put together a task force.

17:06.060 --> 17:08.540
It has to be me. Isabelle's there.
She has her abilities back.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.980
They think I'm one of them.
I'll walk in, I'll get Collier,

17:11.099 --> 17:13.660
I can find out what they're planning
next. Let me do this, please.

17:14.579 --> 17:15.700
I have to.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.380
I've been authorized to accept
your offer of assistance.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.660
What did you have in mind?

17:30.100 --> 17:32.180
We need to restore order
to the streets.

17:33.140 --> 17:35.980
I would like to use your people
as a temporary security force.

17:37.020 --> 17:38.300
The first thing we need to do

17:38.380 --> 17:40.820
is write a list of all the abilities
at your disposal.

17:41.420 --> 17:43.420
Then we can figure out
how to deploy them.

17:43.540 --> 17:46.620
Look, there's no reason to make a plan.
Jordan already has one in place.

17:47.220 --> 17:49.580
I know exactly what we have
at our disposal,

17:50.140 --> 17:52.580
and I know where to send them
to take control of the city.

17:54.380 --> 17:56.820
I'm glad you're so prepared
to take over Seattle,

17:57.820 --> 18:00.100
but when this is over,
I want my city back.

18:02.300 --> 18:05.140
The whole world is terrified
of what's happening here.

18:05.340 --> 18:06.540
That's an opportunity.

18:06.740 --> 18:07.740
Once this is over,

18:07.860 --> 18:09.980
we use all our influence,
here and abroad,

18:10.060 --> 18:12.220
and push for all-out
war against the positives.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.340
This time, we will be heard.

18:14.980 --> 18:15.980
Yes.

18:16.340 --> 18:17.340
Great.

18:17.740 --> 18:19.020
Funny how things happen.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.020
You've got Collier,
but you're losing Seattle.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.500
You're wrong.

18:23.740 --> 18:26.500
I'm not going to stand by
and watch a militia

18:26.700 --> 18:28.900
of positives
take command of this city.

18:29.220 --> 18:31.660
We thought the movement would
fall apart. Once we had Collier,

18:31.780 --> 18:32.980
but that didn't happen.

18:33.220 --> 18:35.380
Someone stepped in and took his place.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.700
- You're talking about Kyle?
- That's right.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.500
He has to be stopped.

18:40.340 --> 18:41.380
You have to stop him.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.060
You're going back
into Promise City

18:44.740 --> 18:47.220
and you're going
to kill Kyle Baldwin.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.540
Kyle's your only real connection

18:52.740 --> 18:56.780
to your past, this idea of yourself
that you've been hanging onto.

18:56.860 --> 18:58.700
Once he's gone, you'll let it go.

18:59.140 --> 19:01.220
You want him dead.
I'm your weapon.

19:02.420 --> 19:03.420
I get it.

19:10.780 --> 19:12.540
You've been out of contact
for a long time.

19:12.620 --> 19:14.500
- Where have you been?
- I was doing damage control.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.340
Skouris has been telling people
I'm marked.

19:16.460 --> 19:17.540
Do they believe her?

19:18.380 --> 19:19.580
My boss doesn't.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.380
Meghan Doyle cares about Tom Baldwin.

19:21.500 --> 19:22.700
I brought her around.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.620
Anyway, their hands are full.

19:24.740 --> 19:26.260
The virus got into NTAC.

19:26.740 --> 19:27.980
It killed Baldwin's sister, too.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.300
I had to shed a few tears
just for appearance's sake.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.060
This thing has gotten out of control.

19:34.180 --> 19:35.780
Half of NTAC is developing
new abilities.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.020
How are we responding?

19:37.300 --> 19:38.660
Collier's been marked.

19:39.780 --> 19:41.460
We're waiting for him to turn.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.300
In the meantime,
I sent Isabelle to Promise City,

19:45.460 --> 19:47.260
to deal with the new
leader of the movement,

19:48.460 --> 19:49.460
Kyle Baldwin.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.260
Good.

19:57.860 --> 20:00.420
Your body produces
abnormal amounts

20:00.540 --> 20:02.940
of an enzyme
called Ubiquinone.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.820
It's a compound that
boosts the immune system,

20:05.940 --> 20:10.500
and overproduction of it
made you resistant to promicin.

20:12.260 --> 20:14.580
If we replicate that effect,
can we make a vaccine?

20:14.660 --> 20:16.500
People are dying right now.
We don't have time

20:16.580 --> 20:19.060
to mass-produce some enzyme
and get it to people.

20:19.180 --> 20:21.220
We don't have to
mass-produce anything.

20:21.300 --> 20:24.620
Ubiquinone is already
available as a supplement.

20:24.780 --> 20:27.260
They sell it in pills in health
food stores, pharmacies.

20:27.380 --> 20:30.060
If you take enough of them,
can you develop a resistance quickly?

20:32.340 --> 20:34.660
I just checked in on your brother.
He doesn't look good.

20:38.020 --> 20:39.780
We have to get word
out about these pills.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.060
You go.
I'll start making phone calls.

20:45.540 --> 20:46.900
The inhibitor is working.

20:47.660 --> 20:49.100
You're no longer contagious,

20:50.380 --> 20:53.220
but your body is still
producing promicin, and...

20:54.300 --> 20:58.540
since it can no longer disperse it
into the air via your ability,

20:59.500 --> 21:01.260
it's building up in your system.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.220
I'm choking on the stuff.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.780
It's all right, Danny,
we're going to figure it out.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.420
So, what can we do to help him?

21:09.860 --> 21:12.300
We could take him off the inhibitor.

21:12.940 --> 21:14.820
Physically, he'd be fine.

21:15.060 --> 21:16.420
But I'd be contagious again.

21:17.540 --> 21:19.540
- Exactly.
- No way.

21:20.060 --> 21:21.340
- That's not an option.
- Danny!

21:21.460 --> 21:22.500
No, Shawn.

21:22.620 --> 21:24.660
What happens
if I stay on the inhibitor?

21:27.340 --> 21:28.460
You saying I'll die?

21:47.940 --> 21:49.220
I'm getting you out of here.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.460
That thing inside you.
There's a way to get rid of it.

21:51.820 --> 21:52.820
How?

21:53.340 --> 21:55.300
You can worry about that
once you're out of here.

21:55.900 --> 21:57.460
No matter what happens to me,
don't stop

21:57.580 --> 22:00.140
until you're through the front door.
My car's right outside.

22:00.260 --> 22:02.820
If anything happens to me,
you need to call Kyle right away.

22:03.420 --> 22:04.900
Parrish sent Isabelle after him.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.180
If you're an NTAC agent again,

22:07.820 --> 22:09.260
what happens once we're outta here?

22:10.180 --> 22:11.780
You mean, am I going to arrest you?

22:12.140 --> 22:14.140
I'd love to,
but that's not the plan.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.300
As much as it hurts me to admit it,
this city needs you right now.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.180
Are you ready?

22:39.860 --> 22:42.820
You flinched when I told you
Isabelle was going after your son.

22:43.220 --> 22:46.060
No one's ever managed
to get rid of a mark before.

22:46.140 --> 22:48.060
You're going to have
to tell me how you did it.

22:48.420 --> 22:49.460
Later.

22:50.460 --> 22:52.780
All our teams are in place.
We already have Ravenna under control.

22:52.860 --> 22:53.860
Beacon Hill's quiet, too.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.980
Good, let's move some of
your people into Northgate.

22:56.060 --> 22:58.180
See if we can stop the looting.
We can't start distributing

22:58.260 --> 23:00.580
these Ubiquinone supplements
until the city is calm.

23:06.780 --> 23:07.900
Hi, Kyle.

23:27.560 --> 23:28.600
Close your eyes.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.680
No.

23:33.560 --> 23:34.960
If you're going to do
what I think you are,

23:35.080 --> 23:36.520
you have to look me in the eye.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.240
You couldn't kill me.

24:18.760 --> 24:19.800
You're human.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.240
There's so much of
the world that I never saw.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.760
So much that's beautiful.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.440
You have time.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.320
You can see whatever you want.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.080
We can.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.520
You have a good heart, Kyle.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.600
Goodbye.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.800
These pills are the way that
we can stop anyone else from dying.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.200
I'm proud to say
that the 4400 center

25:06.320 --> 25:08.080
is working in conjunction
with the government

25:08.200 --> 25:09.680
and residents of Promise City

25:09.800 --> 25:11.840
to distribute this
over-the-counter product

25:12.040 --> 25:13.680
to every neighborhood in Seattle.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.080
If you haven't already been infected,
these will either save your life,

25:17.240 --> 25:19.040
or they will keep you
from getting an ability.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.680
The goverment is also working
with relief agencies

25:21.760 --> 25:24.440
to air-lift supplies
of Ubiquinone into the city,

25:24.840 --> 25:26.360
so there'll be enough for everyone.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.880
People are wondering what
seattle is going to look like

25:29.080 --> 25:30.800
when this is all over,
how many people...

25:31.120 --> 25:32.640
will have lost their lives,

25:32.800 --> 25:35.880
how a city with so many unwanted
new abilities Is going to function.

25:36.560 --> 25:37.600
The truth is,

25:37.880 --> 25:39.200
we don't have any answers,

25:39.560 --> 25:42.400
but this city has survived a lot,

25:43.200 --> 25:44.360
and it will survive this.

25:45.360 --> 25:48.080
Thank you all for coming.
You risked a lot to get this message out

25:48.200 --> 25:49.760
and do not forget
to take your pills.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.880
Shawn... Thank you.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.960
None of this is going to mean anything
unless that air-lift happens right away.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.080
We're working on it.
I'm coordinating distribution

25:58.160 --> 26:00.680
between the CDC, FEMA
and the Red Cross.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.080
Look, I know that you're
dealing with a lot,

26:03.440 --> 26:04.800
but you helped keep this contained,

26:04.880 --> 26:07.360
and you were the right face
to put in front of the public.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.600
Yeah, buddy, I'm right here.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.160
It really hurts.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.160
It hurts to breathe.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.080
I'm going to fix that.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.400
- Make you feel better for a little bit.
- No...

26:35.360 --> 26:36.360
Don't.

26:37.320 --> 26:38.760
You did that an hour ago.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.360
Look at me.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.600
Danny...

26:42.840 --> 26:44.480
we're going to take
you off the inhibitor,

26:44.720 --> 26:46.560
and we're going to put you
in isolation...

26:46.800 --> 26:48.240
- It's too dangerous.
- Not anymore.

26:48.360 --> 26:49.720
We know about those pills now.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.520
What if they don't work around me?

26:52.720 --> 26:55.480
Or what if in a week from now,
my ability gets stronger?

26:56.280 --> 26:57.880
The whole thing could start again.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.080
Too many people are
dead because of me, Shawn.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.080
It's not your fault.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.560
I know, but I have to live with it.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.400
I'm not going to make
it through this, Shawn.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.160
I know it.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.240
You're not going to die, Danny.

27:17.320 --> 27:19.560
- I'm not going to let you.
- It's okay.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.360
But I need you
to do something for me.

27:25.480 --> 27:26.960
Just make it stop hurting.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.040
Just make the pain go away
for good, okay?

27:30.160 --> 27:32.480
Oh, Danny, no,
I'm not going to do that.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.800
I'm not going to do that.
You're my little brother.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.720
Then I'm begging you, brother.

27:36.840 --> 27:39.040
- Don't.
- Please, Shawn.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.280
Let me be the last victim.

27:44.560 --> 27:45.800
Please do it.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.680
Please...

27:49.720 --> 27:51.400
Please, Shawn, I beg you.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.720
Please, shawn, do it.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.960
I love you.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.480
Please! I can't breathe.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.320
You made your choice.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.040
You were our only hope
for the future!

29:36.640 --> 29:38.120
Your future's dead now.

30:21.480 --> 30:22.640
You're free now.

30:24.920 --> 30:26.880
Make this world
better than it is.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.960
You understand what you have to do
to get rid of that thing inside you?

30:49.680 --> 30:51.560
You'll have to mend fences
with Shawn.

30:52.160 --> 30:54.440
Well, I'm more than willing.
I hope he will be, too.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.640
Jordan...

30:57.120 --> 30:58.320
there's one more thing.

30:59.080 --> 31:01.040
There's seven names there.
The rest of the marked.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.120
They're going to need
the same treatment you get.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.120
These are powerful people.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.440
That's why NTAC can't handle it.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.000
We'd never be able to get
them through official channels.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.200
I can't help but wonder
when we walk back into the city,

31:18.280 --> 31:19.760
who's going to be in charge,

31:20.480 --> 31:21.760
my side or yours?

31:24.480 --> 31:25.600
I think, soon...

31:26.480 --> 31:28.120
that distinction
won't mean a thing.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.000
Be well, Tom.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.120
We are gathered here
today to pay our respects

31:47.240 --> 31:48.920
to Susan and Danny Farrell,

31:49.440 --> 31:51.480
a wonderful mother
and a loving son.

31:51.680 --> 31:52.920
They will be missed,

31:53.040 --> 31:54.400
as will so many others.

31:54.720 --> 31:57.160
The entire city is
grief-stricken today.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.960
We're all asking ourselves
the same question...

32:00.320 --> 32:03.480
Are we going to deal with
all this lost, all this pain?

32:03.920 --> 32:05.320
But I believe that in that question,

32:05.480 --> 32:08.000
relies our answer to salvation.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.800
Because it is a shared lost,
it is a shared pain,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.120
that only together,
with your sympathy,

32:13.200 --> 32:15.240
with your understanding,
with your love,

32:15.280 --> 32:17.360
we could realize all this tragedy.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.600
Shawn, I'm sorry.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.200
I'm so sorry, man.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.240
Thank you.

33:01.560 --> 33:02.960
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.560
Jordan told me everything
that happened.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.520
You okay?

33:08.680 --> 33:09.880
Yeah, I'll get there...

33:11.520 --> 33:14.360
And I know you cared about Isabelle.
I'm sorry she's gone.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.600
I know how you're feeling
right now, Shawn.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.840
You're thinking that everyone's gone,
that you're alone.

33:31.760 --> 33:32.840
But you're not.

33:33.800 --> 33:34.800
I'm here.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.520
So's Kyle,

33:36.880 --> 33:38.920
And we're going to help
each other get through this.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.280
We're going to figure out
how to be a family, okay?

33:55.760 --> 33:58.080
I just got a revised
estimate of the tally so far.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.480
We know the city's
lost 9,000 people.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.960
That's just confirmed dead.
It's not a final count.

34:04.880 --> 34:08.000
So we're looking at 9,000
new abilities at the very least.

34:08.120 --> 34:10.600
A lot of those abilities are gonna
belong to people we know.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.480
NTAC, police, paramedics.

34:12.719 --> 34:15.080
I mean, we were the first
ones exposed to this thing.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.800
What are we gonna do,
arrest ourselves?

34:16.920 --> 34:18.320
No one's arresting anybody right now.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.520
Every city agency's
operating on a skeleton crew,

34:21.199 --> 34:23.199
and we won't have federal
help until they lift the quarantine.

34:23.280 --> 34:24.960
That'll be a week, maybe more.

34:25.159 --> 34:26.480
So we're still on our own.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.080
The loudest voice
of authority in Seattle

34:29.159 --> 34:30.679
right now is Jordan Collier's.

34:30.840 --> 34:33.960
Well, his p-positives are the most
effective law and order we've got.

34:34.199 --> 34:36.480
And when quarantine's lifted,
what happens?

34:36.639 --> 34:39.719
Are Collier's people gonna stand down?
Will they give the city back to us?

34:40.320 --> 34:41.440
Would you?

35:22.400 --> 35:23.880
The time has come...

35:24.920 --> 35:26.960
for this city to begin healing.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.480
I never intended...

35:29.800 --> 35:31.600
promicin to spread this way,

35:32.520 --> 35:35.080
but the sacrifices
of the past few days

35:35.760 --> 35:37.200
have not been in vain!

35:38.600 --> 35:39.760
This tragedy,

35:40.480 --> 35:42.120
terrible as it may have been,

35:43.160 --> 35:44.200
had meaning,

35:44.480 --> 35:45.800
and those who died...

35:49.840 --> 35:52.960
are the heralds of a new age!

36:01.720 --> 36:05.480
Thousands upon thousands
of you have new abilities,

36:06.520 --> 36:09.240
and in time, you will all
contribute to this movement,

36:10.160 --> 36:11.360
a movement...

36:12.200 --> 36:15.280
that now claims all Seattle
as its home!

37:11.080 --> 37:12.240
Who are you?

37:13.240 --> 37:15.520
I'm Jed Garrity.
Who the hell are you?

37:52.240 --> 37:54.040
We stood by the city...

37:54.800 --> 37:56.240
in its hour of need,

37:57.360 --> 38:00.680
and we will now guide
this city into the future.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.840
<i>We're all miracles.</i>

38:03.920 --> 38:05.080
<i>Every one of us,</i>

38:05.720 --> 38:08.440
<i>and together,
we will do wondrous things.</i>

38:08.960 --> 38:11.600
See?
I told you he was a good guy.

38:13.360 --> 38:16.400
Maia, can't you see
what's happening?

38:17.080 --> 38:20.000
Jordan Collier is naming himself
dictator of Seattle.

38:20.120 --> 38:21.680
There's nothing good about that.

38:22.760 --> 38:23.800
You're wrong, mom.

38:25.360 --> 38:27.000
We're in charge now.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.240
It's better that way.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.760
I've spoken to the world before...

38:35.880 --> 38:37.240
of heaven on Earth.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.560
Many of you thought it impossible,

38:41.240 --> 38:42.280
But now,

38:43.040 --> 38:44.520
I'm convinced...

38:45.040 --> 38:47.120
we will see it in our lifetimes!

39:25.480 --> 39:27.000
There's a way to live with it.

39:29.520 --> 39:30.640
You killed people.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.640
Even though it wasn't really you,
you still feel responsible.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.160
Believe me, I have been there.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.000
2 people are dead. They're not Collier.
They're not coming back.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.680
But you're still here.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.400
You have to figure out
how to move on.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.120
How?

40:03.880 --> 40:05.160
Dad, it's time.
