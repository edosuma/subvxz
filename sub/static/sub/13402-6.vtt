at the back of the paper?‘

The cops
are withholding details.

- You're staying here?
- Doctor's orders.

You're Sara Harvey, aren't you?
I'm Jenna Marshall.

00:09.740 --> 00:11.708
(Caleb)
We need to get
that jacket to AD.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.001
How can I fix this?

00:17.010 --> 00:18.204
Maybe you can start
by figuring out

00:18.210 --> 00:19.700
why you're wearing
one guy's ring

00:19.720 --> 00:21.415
when you might na ve

00:21.420 --> 00:23.445
- Have you guys met?
- No, I don't think we have.

00:23.450 --> 00:26.248
This is Detective Marco Furey.
He is my new supervisor.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.818
Elliot Rollins was last seen
In Baltimore.

00:27.820 --> 00:30.186
We deliberately pointed
the police towards Philly.

00:30.190 --> 00:31.726
'That's where the trail
was supposed to end.‘

00:31.730 --> 00:33.027
Somebody knows what I did.

00:33.030 --> 00:34.258
Will you marry me?

[pop song playing]

00:42.870 --> 00:45.100
Aria, I called you last night

00:45.110 --> 00:47.328
after you went to Ezra's.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.979
Yeah. I'm sorry
I didn't get back to you.

00:49.980 --> 00:51.299
Well, is everything okay?

00:51.310 --> 00:53.005
Did he find out
about the Nicole call?

00:53.020 --> 00:54.942
No, he didn't.

00:54.950 --> 00:56.372
Everything's fine.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.813
Will you just focus
on living enemies

00:58.820 --> 01:01.459
instead of dead ones, please?

01:01.460 --> 01:03.485
What are you talking about?

01:03.490 --> 01:05.458
Hanna thinks that Rollins
could still be alive.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.322
That detective told Ali

01:09.330 --> 01:11.867
he saw a photo of
Elliot Rollins in a rental car.

01:11.870 --> 01:15.966
Hey, last time I checked, ghosts
don't show up in photographs.

01:15.970 --> 01:18.803
Okay. We were all there
that night, Hanna.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.107
The man is dead.

01:20.110 --> 01:22.305
You killed him,
and we buried him.

01:22.310 --> 01:23.868
Now, somebody knows.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.199
So, frankly, that's bad enough

01:25.210 --> 01:26.609
without having to go
all "Walking Dead."

01:26.620 --> 01:28.315
She's right about
the traffic cams, Spence.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.776
If there's a photo of him--

01:29.790 --> 01:31.485
Yeah, that could have
easily been manufactured.

01:31.490 --> 01:32.787
You find a Rollins look-alike
and you stick him

01:32.790 --> 01:34.485
behind the wheel
of a mid-size sedan.

01:34.490 --> 01:36.981
The important thing
is that A.D.'s fake..

Thank you.

01:39.030 --> 01:40.918
A.D.'s fa_ke Rollins trail
picks up

01:40.930 --> 01:42.488
exactly where ours left off.

01:42.500 --> 01:46.561
Yeah. This has to be
Rollins' partner in crime.

01:46.570 --> 01:48.390
Mary or Jenna knows
that we killed him

01:48.400 --> 01:51.164
and they're helping cover it up.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.307
You call that helping?

01:52.310 --> 01:54.631
"A" never does anything
for free.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.507
Okay? Not test scores
and definitely not a cover-up.

was working with Rollins

01:59.250 --> 02:00.899

what we did

02:00.920 --> 02:03.616
she could be grooming Sara to
become her new seeing-eye dog.

02:03.620 --> 02:05.247
No, there is no
grooming involved.

to the grave

02:39.290 --> 02:44.489

you won't tell what I said

'Cause two can keep a secret

02:47.230 --> 02:49.619
If one of them is dead

02:50.870 --> 02:54.067
We had no choice, okay?
A.D. was gonna kill him.

02:54.070 --> 02:55.435
A.D. wanted Charlotte's killer

02:55.440 --> 02:57.431
and we, we thought
that you were guilty.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.907
Well, you were wrong.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.764
I know, but you had already
checked yourself into Welby

03:00.780 --> 03:01.769
and we all thought that

03:01.780 --> 03:03.270
Elliot was gonna be able
to protect you.

No, okay, you thought that

Hanna's life _
was worth more than mIne.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.575
Hey, in case you forgot,
Hanna just ran over the guy

03:09.590 --> 03:11.717
who really is to blame
for all of this.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.439
We did everything
we could to save you, All.

Just like we did everything
we could to save Hanna.

- Well, I'm coming with you.

that you're pissed at us.

the opportunity to sneak

it's Mary Drake,
who's sleeping one room over.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.222
We all should have followed her.

03:51.230 --> 03:52.481

04:02.670 --> 04:05.468
She's going to Ali's house
to keep eyes on Mary Drake.

04:05.470 --> 04:06.835
So, now, we're back on Mary?

04:08.280 --> 04:10.999

I'm gonna keep tabs on Jenna.

Rollins' burner phone?

I'll let you know
ifI hear anything.

Hey.

Hi.

Yeah. Fine.

thank you so much for waiting.

Not a problem at all,
Miss DiLaurentis.

- Hello, again.
- Hi.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.814
- Please, have a seat.
- Yeah.

04:53.820 --> 04:55.310
Miss DiLaurentis..

04:56.260 --> 04:58.057
...this person that you married

04:58.060 --> 05:01.427
is actually a man
named Archer Dunhill.

05:01.430 --> 05:02.749
He's 32 years old.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.556
'Born in Wales.‘

05:04.570 --> 05:05.889
What else do you know about him?

05:05.900 --> 05:08.095
He's wanted in the UK
for several counts

05:08.100 --> 05:09.829
of petty theft and fraud.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.533
Uh, what about the rental car?

05:13.540 --> 05:15.132
The traffic camera photo?

05:15.140 --> 05:16.778
Uh, we're looking into it.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.702
Officer Cavanaugh
has been dispatched to meet

05:18.710 --> 05:20.849
'with a number of witnesses
personally.‘

05:23.420 --> 05:25.388
Now, there was a rental car

05:25.390 --> 05:27.119
in Rollins' name.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.850
Now, we don't believe
that Archer Dunhill was in it.

05:29.860 --> 05:33.023
But we do suspect
that the car rental

05:33.030 --> 05:36.989
train ticket, all this was
created to divert our attention

05:37.000 --> 05:38.922
from what really happened.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.396
What really happened?

05:43.410 --> 05:45.105
Uh, we're not exactly sure.

05:45.110 --> 05:46.600
But you have a theory.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.278
Why continue using
the credit cards

05:49.280 --> 05:51.475
if you've already disappeared?

05:51.480 --> 05:54.244
'We suspect he wanted us
to find those charges'

05:54.250 --> 05:55.877
to follow that trail.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.747
He's making it look like
Archer Dunhill's long gone

05:58.750 --> 06:01.856
when, in fact, he could be
much closer than we thought.

06:02.620 --> 06:05.748
Why? Why would he do that?

06:05.760 --> 06:07.978
Perhaps he's got
unfinished business here.

06:09.470 --> 06:12.291
We do believe that
Alison's still in danger.

06:12.300 --> 06:13.494
Oh, my God.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.263
Now, you have 24-hour
police protection

06:15.270 --> 06:17.465
and we're doubling
our efforts to find him.

06:17.470 --> 06:20.598
Miss DiLaurentis,
I give you my word

06:20.610 --> 06:22.430
we will get this guy.

Um..

06:47.470 --> 06:50.132
- Moment?
- Yeah.

06:50.140 --> 06:51.289
I obviously did not know that

06:51.310 --> 06:52.800
you were a police officer
at the time.

06:52.810 --> 06:54.505
And you have a problem
with law enforcement?

06:54.510 --> 06:56.375
- No. I--
- Yeah, no?

06:56.380 --> 06:58.348
[chuckles]
Okay, yeah.

06:58.350 --> 07:01.342
Uh, you're investigating
my friend's husband.

07:01.350 --> 07:04.114
I wouldn't want anything
to get complicated.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.014
Not that you're at all
interested in anything with me

07:08.020 --> 07:10.580
Ijust, um.. Just saying.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.059
Okay.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.452
Is there anything
she could be holding back?

07:17.470 --> 07:19.927
Anything that would help
the investigation?

07:19.940 --> 07:23.694
No. No, I think
s-she told you everything.

- Yeah.

Ali was dead too, remember?

11:30.490 --> 11:32.708
(Aria)
'No sign of Hanna,
but she just spotted Sara'

11:32.720 --> 11:34.017
'going up to Jenna's room.‘

11:34.020 --> 11:35.783
Well, either Jenna
or Mary orchestrated

11:35.790 --> 11:37.314
_ that call
to Rollins' burner phone

11:37.330 --> 11:39.184
and all of those bogus charges
to his credit card.

11:39.190 --> 11:41.021
So, ifI can find
his credit card information

11:41.030 --> 11:43.396
inside the Lost Woods,
maybe I can convince Hanna

11:43.400 --> 11:45.994
_that "The Rev_enant"
was just a really tWIsted movie.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.797
(Aria)
'It was based on
a true story, Spencer--'

11:47.800 --> 11:49.233
Whatever.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.389
'Maybe you should wait'

11:50.410 --> 11:51.536
'till you get backup.‘

11:51.540 --> 11:52.939
It's not me
that I'm worried about.

11:52.940 --> 11:54.862
Besides, I've already broken
into this place.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.677
I can get in and out
without being detected.

11:56.680 --> 11:59.399
- 'Just be careful.‘
- Yeah, just find Hanna.

12:03.620 --> 12:05.986
[intense music]

12:05.990 --> 12:07.685
[gasps]

12:07.690 --> 12:09.954
Spencer.
I thought you were Elliot.

12:09.960 --> 12:13.384
You scared me half to death.
Inside. Come on!

12:17.670 --> 12:19.422
All that security at Alison's.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.125
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's a good thing

12:21.140 --> 12:23.233
but I'm the one who broke ranks
with the bastard.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.434
It's me he wants.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.904
So you believe them?
The police?

12:27.910 --> 12:30.174
That Archer Dunhill's
still in the area?

12:30.180 --> 12:31.238
Yes.

12:36.650 --> 12:39.016
- Have you heard from him?
- No.

12:40.390 --> 12:41.982
He's not in there.

12:41.990 --> 12:43.753
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

12:43.760 --> 12:45.284
You're looking for Elliot?

12:45.290 --> 12:48.054
Yeah, I just.. I thought that
if you and he worked together

12:48.060 --> 12:50.119
then he would know this place
inside and out

12:50.130 --> 12:51.688
and it would be
a good place for him to hide.

12:51.700 --> 12:55.636
Well...if he were here,
I'd probably be dead already.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.609
That man has a temper
like you've never seen.

12:58.610 --> 13:00.999
And you cross him..

13:01.010 --> 13:03.069
Let's just say he handled All
with kid gloves

13:03.080 --> 13:04.809
compared to what he'd do to me.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.469
Then why are you still here
if you're so afraid?

13:08.480 --> 13:11.017
I needed to get a few things
to take back to Alison's.

13:11.890 --> 13:13.744
[clattering]

13:13.760 --> 13:15.955
[intense music]

13:17.190 --> 13:20.023
Spencer, wait. He's dangerous.

13:20.030 --> 13:21.850
Don't go out there empty handed.

13:23.530 --> 13:24.827
Okay.

13:38.980 --> 13:41.175
It's okay.
There's no one out here.

13:41.180 --> 13:42.545
[sighs]

13:49.760 --> 13:51.648
Hanna?

13:51.660 --> 13:52.786
Please tell_ me
you didn't just--

13:52.790 --> 13:54.451
Don't worry,
I didn't go in.

13:54.460 --> 13:55.529
[sighs]

13:55.530 --> 13:57.828
I wanted to,
but I've just been sitting here.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.492
So I talked to Spencer.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.491
She's starting to believe
Mary's story.

14:06.270 --> 14:08.204
So that leaves us with Jenna.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.448
Wow, it's like we never left.

14:15.620 --> 14:16.871
I know.

14:18.420 --> 14:20.445
Why couldn't we have been
one of those people?

14:21.820 --> 14:23.481
I'm not saying
their lives are perfect.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.227
'I don't need perfect.‘

14:27.030 --> 14:28.554
'I'd settle for boring.‘

14:29.800 --> 14:31.256
FuncﬂonaL

14:31.270 --> 14:34.023
You couldn't be boring
if you tried.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.305
Ezra proposed.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.773
Marriage? When?

14:42.780 --> 14:44.133
Last night.

14:47.580 --> 14:48.945
You said no?

14:48.950 --> 14:51.373
I said I have to think about it.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.016
I-I can't promise Ezra forever

14:57.030 --> 15:00.227
when my future could be spent
behind bars.

15:00.230 --> 15:02.721
We killed someone, Hanna. We
can't just walk away from that.

15:02.730 --> 15:04.994
And now A.D. knows.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.218
Ezra wants a marriage, a wife.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.130
Not conjugal visits.

15:10.140 --> 15:12.358
Maybe that's not
your decision to make.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.231
Maybe it's his.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.499
Does that mean you told Jordan
what happened?

15:23.250 --> 15:27.141
I mean, I-I guess that's why I,
I texted you earlier.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.981
I mean, if you guys
can make it work, then maybe..

15:29.990 --> 15:31.309
- Hanna! What are you..
- No.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.025
- It's over.
- It's a diamond.

15:33.030 --> 15:34.554
No, it's not.

15:36.260 --> 15:37.397
[sighs]

15:38.230 --> 15:39.993
I gave Jordan his ring back

15:40.000 --> 15:42.560
and I bought a fake one

15:42.570 --> 15:44.959
so I wouldn't have
to tell people the truth.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.138
We broke up.

15:51.180 --> 15:53.375
You didn't want Spencer to know.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.642
Or my mom.

15:56.650 --> 15:59.210
Or our caterer. I mean,
she was really invested.

15:59.220 --> 16:01.438
- Han..
- Listen to me..

16:02.520 --> 16:06.388
Jordan and I
were not...meant to be.

16:07.030 --> 16:08.486
I know that now.

16:09.830 --> 16:13.288
But you and Ezra,
that's a whole different story.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.729
Don't let this be how it ends.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.139
Come on.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.751
[indistinct chatter on radio]

16:46.630 --> 16:48.029
Hey.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.059
Hey, Caleb.

16:50.070 --> 16:51.890
- Am I interrupting?
- Oh, no, no, no.

16:51.910 --> 16:53.639
Take a seat.

16:53.640 --> 16:54.766
What's with the bag?

16:54.780 --> 16:56.429
Are you coming or going?

16:56.440 --> 16:58.328
Uh, I'm trying
to figure that out actually.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.899
I got my car, thinking I might
head back to DC or New York.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.979
And you ended up
back in Rosewood.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.242
Yeah. Funny how that happens.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.551
What about you and Spencer?

17:12.930 --> 17:14.181
We, uh..

17:15.460 --> 17:17.928
I don't know. I don't know
what we are right now.

17:17.930 --> 17:19.261
Because of Hanna?

17:20.970 --> 17:22.631
Because of a lot of things.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.264
You know, sometimes,
I think I know everything

17:27.280 --> 17:28.907
about this place.

17:28.910 --> 17:31.276
And that other times, I feel
like you could write me a book

17:31.280 --> 17:32.804
about everything I don't know.

17:32.810 --> 17:35.108
[sighs]
Yeah.

17:35.120 --> 17:38.248
Well, I'll let you know when
I'm ready to write the sequel.

17:39.590 --> 17:42.354
Don't you feel
like that, though?

17:42.360 --> 17:45.523
Like, there's something
they're not telling us.

17:45.530 --> 17:46.622
Like what?

17:48.160 --> 17:50.720
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.565
And what about you?
How's your novel coming?

17:56.740 --> 17:58.367
Good, I think.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.530
I'm, uh..

18:00.310 --> 18:01.709
...on my last round of notes.

18:02.740 --> 18:04.276
There a happy ending?

18:06.350 --> 18:09.410
Yeah. I'm working on it.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.616
[flute music]

18:27.200 --> 18:28.667
(Jenna)
'It's open'

18:33.170 --> 18:35.161
You can set it
on the coffee table. Thank you.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.481
[music continues]

19:02.370 --> 19:04.429
I left him a message.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.834
Hello, Emily.

19:09.110 --> 19:11.533
Emily? What are you doing here?

19:11.550 --> 19:13.541
She was looking
at your computer.

19:13.550 --> 19:16.246
Someone is threatening us again.

19:16.250 --> 19:19.117
- And I think it's you.
- Really?

19:19.120 --> 19:20.280
How come?

19:20.290 --> 19:22.212
'Cause you're here in Rosewood.

19:22.220 --> 19:23.585
And you're putting on
a concert for her.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.922
We're not threatening you,
Emily.

19:25.930 --> 19:27.249
'I know you don't believe me'

19:27.260 --> 19:28.955
'but I really was
looking out for you.‘

19:28.960 --> 19:30.325
'I care about you.‘

19:30.330 --> 19:31.399
And all we're doing is looking

19:31.400 --> 19:32.662
for the same thing you are.

19:32.670 --> 19:35.127
Stop talking, Sara.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.233
'That's enough.‘

19:37.240 --> 19:39.367
What Sara meant to say is..

19:40.440 --> 19:45.002
Mind your own
damn business, Emily.

19:45.010 --> 19:46.568
This is my business, Jenna.

19:46.580 --> 19:49.117
What I'm confused about
is how you're involved.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.917
Elliot Rollins is a fraud.

19:50.920 --> 19:54.515
'And somehow, you knew his real
identity before anyone else.‘

19:54.520 --> 19:57.250
'The police are looking
for anyone with information.‘

19:57.260 --> 19:58.750
I can give them your name

19:58.760 --> 20:01.354
or you can explain to me
what the hell is going on.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.852
The truth?
Charlotte was my friend.

20:07.640 --> 20:11.736
So, everything's working out
well with you two?

20:12.370 --> 20:14.031
It certainly is.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.928
We have you to thank.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.601
[phone ringing]

20:19.350 --> 20:21.204
Doctor Rollins speaking.

20:22.420 --> 20:23.819
I'll be right there.

20:25.150 --> 20:26.811
Duty calls, I'm afraid.

20:29.390 --> 20:31.210
[sighs]
Wait here.

20:33.230 --> 20:34.788
Archie, wait.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.799
Can't thank you enough
for being here.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.223
I don't know
what I would have done if you..

20:40.240 --> 20:42.868
I know. But I'm here now.

20:43.670 --> 20:44.864
And I love you.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.371
- So..
- So..

20:58.390 --> 21:00.642
I was hoping to bring you
more good news.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.651
About my birth mother,
did you find her?

21:02.660 --> 21:06.881
No, nothing yet, but I-I
promise you I will find her.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.994
She's coming today
to meet the new doctor.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.837
Alison?

21:16.840 --> 21:20.560
She's not the person
that you remember.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.332
Archie needs to win her trust.

21:22.340 --> 21:25.229
Convince her
that I'm doing better.

21:25.250 --> 21:28.174
Alison is the only chance that
I have of getting out of here.

21:28.180 --> 21:30.068
Well, he's a charmer.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.514
He should throw in
a few compliments.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.909
Ali loves a suck-up,
always has.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.581
Archer can handle it.

21:36.590 --> 21:38.558
He knows everything about me.

21:39.430 --> 21:42.524
My family, my upbringing..

21:43.430 --> 21:45.352
...everything I've done.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.628
Everything.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.193
And he loves me.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.939
He wants me out of here
as much as I do.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.565
Well, you're lucky.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.674
That kind of love is rare.

22:00.250 --> 22:02.047
I'm lucky to have you too.

22:06.090 --> 22:08.046
So you got Archer into Welby.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.709
I knew someone..

22:09.720 --> 22:12.211
...who helped Archer
get a passport, a new identity

22:12.230 --> 22:13.720
so they could be together.

22:13.730 --> 22:16.324
And how exactly did your
friendship with Charlotte begin?

22:16.330 --> 22:18.719
I read about her, Emily.

22:18.730 --> 22:20.766
Wasting away in that hospital.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.193
So I reached out.

22:23.200 --> 22:26.328
'I figured she'd welcome
a visit even from a stranger.‘

22:26.340 --> 22:29.935
But you see,
I wasn't a stranger.

22:29.940 --> 22:32.079
Mona had told her
everything about me

22:32.080 --> 22:35.072
I was...a celebrity.

22:36.380 --> 22:38.871
'But she's gone now.‘

22:38.890 --> 22:40.619
'Murdered.‘

22:40.620 --> 22:43.009
A few weeks after it happened,
I reached out to Archer.

22:43.020 --> 22:47.582
And guess who answered
his cell phone?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.819
You think the cops
wanna talk to me?

22:50.830 --> 22:52.593
As far as I can tell,
you and your little friend

22:52.600 --> 22:56.468
are the last people to see
Archer before he just...poof!

22:56.470 --> 22:57.698
He disappeared.

22:58.810 --> 23:03.531
Maybe they should ask
you
where he is.

23:03.540 --> 23:05.701
Well, your guess
is as good as mine.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.544
You should go, Emily.

23:18.660 --> 23:21.356
- Do not come back here.
- Is that a threat?

23:21.360 --> 23:23.055
I'm trying
to keep you safe, Emily.

23:23.060 --> 23:26.689
I want you to be safe.
Please, don't come back.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.395
Okay, look,
I'm not afraid of Jenna.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.628
I'm not talking about Jenna.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.437
- I'm talking about--
- Sara!

23:32.940 --> 23:34.407
I need you.

23:36.410 --> 23:38.002
'Now.‘

23:42.380 --> 23:44.018
[phone chimes]

23:46.790 --> 23:48.610
(Caleb)
'You need to take that?‘

23:49.560 --> 23:51.653
No. That's alright.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.527
I'm so sorry, Spencer.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.809
And you were right.
I am confused.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.009
- I never meant--
- I know.

24:18.250 --> 24:20.138
Look, we both made mistakes.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.581
And I'm not saying
that it's okay.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.053
But I really don't
regret trying.

24:31.430 --> 24:32.897
You don't?

24:37.470 --> 24:38.869
When Toby and I broke up..

24:40.210 --> 24:43.134
...I didn't date anyone
for a really, really long time.

24:45.610 --> 24:48.647
And nothing serious anyways,
you know, it's just

24:48.650 --> 24:50.641
nothing ever stuck.

24:52.290 --> 24:54.144
Nothing ever measured up.

24:55.590 --> 24:56.852
'It was like my..'

24:58.630 --> 25:00.928
...my heart had just stopped.

25:04.630 --> 25:07.098
And I felt that way
for a really long time..

25:08.640 --> 25:10.130
Euunﬂlyouﬂ

25:13.770 --> 25:16.671
- Oh, Spence--
- No, it's good.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.500
I'm saying, it's a good thing.

25:18.510 --> 25:20.569
Okay, 'cause, I've, I hurt.

25:20.580 --> 25:22.445
[chuckles]

25:22.450 --> 25:23.849
Believe me, I hurt.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.719
'But I..'

25:28.660 --> 25:31.584
I get to remember
what it felt like..

25:33.460 --> 25:35.087
...to be in love again.

25:44.170 --> 25:46.161
[sighs]

25:47.140 --> 25:49.199
[exhales forcefully]

25:53.010 --> 25:55.046
I think that
you should probably go.

25:58.220 --> 25:59.619
Okay.

26:13.230 --> 26:15.289
- Bye, Caleb.
- Bye.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.748
(Alison)
Welcome back.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.921
You went through my bags.

26:46.930 --> 26:49.763
You should know better
than to take my mom's things.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.604
We both know the conditions
of your release from Welby

26:54.610 --> 26:55.838
but if you want me gone..

26:55.840 --> 26:58.502
I'd like you to explain
a few things.

26:58.510 --> 27:00.341
Gaps in your story.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.043
You said
you never met Charlotte.

27:05.050 --> 27:06.085
Yes.

27:07.190 --> 27:10.114
When I met her,
she went by a different name.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.212
CeCe Drake.

27:12.690 --> 27:13.918
I wonder how she got
the name Drake

27:13.930 --> 27:15.283
if she never met you.

27:16.560 --> 27:19.199
Charlotte called
herself CeCe Drake?

27:22.040 --> 27:24.235
I.. No, I didn't know that.

27:25.540 --> 27:27.360
Oh, I honestly..

27:29.080 --> 27:30.707
We never met.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.268
Truly.

27:32.280 --> 27:35.374
'I don't know how
she ended up with that name.‘

27:37.320 --> 27:39.481
Except that maybe..

27:39.490 --> 27:41.344
...maybe she knew about me.

27:43.390 --> 27:45.210
'Jessica told her.‘

27:45.230 --> 27:47.425
'Or she found out,
I don't know.‘

27:58.210 --> 28:00.007
This is from Charlotte.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.671
From her birth.

28:03.680 --> 28:06.171
'The doctor was impatient.‘

28:06.180 --> 28:09.274
After a while,
he just cut me open

28:09.280 --> 28:11.976
and...took the baby out.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.379
[crying]
I didn't even
get to hold him.??

28:19.090 --> 28:22.389
Jessica took my child from me.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.925
She took my baby just like
she took everything else.

28:24.930 --> 28:27.865
Just like she took that necklace
when we were children.

28:36.610 --> 28:37.975
[knock on door]

28:41.980 --> 28:44.778
- Hey.
- 'Hey, come in.'

28:44.790 --> 28:47.111
I'm sorry
I didn't call you back.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.281
Well, you-you're here now.

28:53.630 --> 28:55.450
Can I just say something?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.992
I thought we were in
a different place than we are

29:01.000 --> 29:02.490
and that is okay.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.559
We could take a step back.
We-we don't have to get married.

29:04.570 --> 29:06.037
We can just be together--

29:06.040 --> 29:07.234
Ezra.

29:08.810 --> 29:10.334
I want to marry you.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.976
I wanna say yes,
more than anything.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.514
But something happened.

29:19.890 --> 29:22.757
And it, it's something
that might make you wish

29:22.760 --> 29:24.512
you never asked me
that question.

29:25.690 --> 29:27.988
You can tell me anything, Aria.

29:29.760 --> 29:33.321
Yeah, well, the thing is,
I can't un-tell you.

29:37.710 --> 29:39.530
We should probably sit down.

29:46.180 --> 29:48.171
[sighs]
I'm so sorry.

29:48.180 --> 29:51.013
She lied to me.
She lied about everything.

29:52.690 --> 29:55.887
Doctor...Mary Drake..

29:56.620 --> 29:59.088
...being friends with Jenna.

29:59.090 --> 30:01.854
That doesn't mean that
Charlotte didn't love you.

30:01.860 --> 30:03.691
[scoffing]
Love me?

30:03.700 --> 30:05.850
I didn't even know
she had a boyfriend.

30:05.870 --> 30:07.690
And then I married him.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.497
Because, Ali, it went too far.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.195
He took matters
into his own hands.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.735
I thought we were sisters, Em.

30:13.740 --> 30:16.300
'I wasn't her confidant
or her friend.‘

30:16.310 --> 30:17.675
I was just this..

30:17.680 --> 30:20.342
...stepping stone so she could
get out of that place.

30:27.120 --> 30:29.384
We had our first kiss
right here.

30:32.090 --> 30:34.524
It was Christmas Eve.

30:34.530 --> 30:36.953
'Elliot somehow got
the hospital board'

30:36.960 --> 30:39.190
'to approve Charlotte
staying overnight.‘

30:40.100 --> 30:42.091
He made me think
it was my idea.

30:45.170 --> 30:47.161
That Charlotte could live here.

30:48.410 --> 30:50.105
That together
we could convince the judge

30:50.110 --> 30:52.169
that she was stable
and in good hands.

30:53.610 --> 30:55.475
- Ali--
- Don't.

31:01.090 --> 31:03.115
You don't have to go
through this alone.

31:05.260 --> 31:07.421
I know you're upset
we gave your jacket to AD.

31:08.760 --> 31:11.194
Spencer already explained
it to me.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.020
Well, she left something out.

31:14.570 --> 31:17.130
We are so sorry.

31:17.140 --> 31:20.405
I...am so sorry, Ali.

31:22.140 --> 31:23.209
I know.

31:27.580 --> 31:28.649
[sighs]

31:30.580 --> 31:32.411
I'll call you later, okay?

31:42.530 --> 31:43.929

32:22.900 --> 32:24.697
(Spencer)
You didn't have to do that.

32:25.910 --> 32:27.434
You didn't have to pretend.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.099
(Hanna)
I know.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.268
Didn't work anyway.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.474
No.

32:37.420 --> 32:38.671
Are you okay?

32:40.620 --> 32:42.588
I absolutely will be.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.524
You should tell him.

32:48.530 --> 32:51.192
You should tell Caleb
that you and Jordan broke up.

32:55.470 --> 32:57.688
I haven't told anyone
about this.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.606
I had a dream about you.

33:01.610 --> 33:03.669
'When I was in that place
with A.D.'

33:06.050 --> 33:08.200
I was so tired and scared.

33:10.050 --> 33:11.711
I wanted to give up.

33:13.390 --> 33:15.142
'And then suddenly,
there you are.‘

33:16.490 --> 33:17.980
You were all smart

33:17.990 --> 33:19.981
and preppy and..

33:19.990 --> 33:22.185
...ready to hatch
an escape plan.

33:25.430 --> 33:28.069
I really wish I could
have been there, Hanna.

33:28.070 --> 33:29.423
I wish that I could
have helped you.

33:29.440 --> 33:32.136
You did. That's what I'm saying.

33:32.140 --> 33:35.667
You and...all you've
taught me over the years.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.246
[cell phone ringing]

33:41.250 --> 33:43.241

33:44.790 --> 33:46.143

34:05.210 --> 34:07.030
[sighs]
Ali, thank God, where are you?

34:07.540 --> 34:09.098
Home. Why?

34:09.110 --> 34:11.431
'Are the police still
outside your house?‘

34:11.450 --> 34:13.202
Um, yeah.
What's going on, Hanna?

34:14.110 --> 34:15.441
We think AD.
is heading your way.

34:15.450 --> 34:17.441
He might even be there already.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.439
You mean Jenna and Sara.

34:20.450 --> 34:22.611
No, he, as in Elliot Rollins.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.087
The same guy
who put a muzzle over you

34:24.090 --> 34:25.387
and fed you crazy pills.

34:25.390 --> 34:26.823
'_He crawled out of
his own damn grave'

34:26.830 --> 34:27.956

34:27.960 --> 34:29.450
Ali, it's Spencer.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.098
Look, Hanna might be right,
so just make sure that

34:31.100 --> 34:32.749
that cop doesn't leave your
side, and we are on our way.

34:32.770 --> 34:34.067
Oh, my God.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.533
Officer.

34:40.240 --> 34:41.764
Can you please come inside?

34:52.490 --> 34:54.378
My friends think that Archer
Dunhill could be on his way

34:54.390 --> 34:57.587
so if you could just
wait in here until backup comes.

34:57.590 --> 34:58.989
Spence.

34:58.990 --> 35:00.855
Yeah, yeah, he's inside now.

35:02.260 --> 35:04.455
Okay. I will.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.058

wasn't at his post.

- Where is she?

- Where's Ali?
- It's okay, Spencer.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.699
She's okay. Alison's upstairs.

36:16.700 --> 36:17.894

I'm okay.

I'm just glad
that you guys are here.

36:32.990 --> 36:35.117
What happened?

36:35.120 --> 36:36.883
He was dressed up like a cop.

36:37.930 --> 36:39.511
He had on another mask.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.079
He could have killed me,
but I think

36:43.100 --> 36:44.920
the police sirens
scared him off.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.565
It was really him, wasn't it?

[cell phone beeps]

36:58.850 --> 37:00.340

could still be out there.

the record collection.

from the attic.

I'd push you away
