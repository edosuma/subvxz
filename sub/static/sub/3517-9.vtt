01:12.868 --> 01:14.870
Hey, Freddy! How ya doing?

01:14.870 --> 01:17.080
- Hey.
- All right, that's what I like to hear.

01:17.080 --> 01:21.001
- My man.
- Catch you later, brother.

03:43.685 --> 03:45.770
I spoke to everyone
I know at the <i> Daily.</i>

03:45.770 --> 03:47.897
Nobody's naming sources,
but it has to be Remy.

03:47.897 --> 03:50.316
- Is Galloway going on the record?
- He wouldn't.

03:50.316 --> 03:52.902
- Not without speaking to us first.
- Let's be sure about that.

03:52.902 --> 03:55.822
- I'll talk to Adam.
- Maybe it's smarter to avoid contact.

03:55.822 --> 03:58.575
Somebody has to respond,
whether it's him, or us, or both.

03:58.575 --> 04:00.452
We have to coordinate,
and do it carefully.

04:00.452 --> 04:02.620
Let me take care of this.

04:02.620 --> 04:04.330
Well, let's just
think this through.

04:04.330 --> 04:09.586
- I've got it covered, Francis.
- OK.

04:09.586 --> 04:11.379
What should I do?
Head back to the office?

04:11.379 --> 04:13.590
You should work here.
We can't avoid the press if you leave.

04:13.590 --> 04:15.508
- All right. You hold down the fort.
- Yes, sir.

04:15.508 --> 04:17.969
- And you follow Claire's lead.
- We'll shut this down, sir.

04:17.969 --> 04:20.555
- There can't be any doubt.
- Let's walk through a timeline.

04:20.555 --> 04:22.849
- So you first met him when?
- Whitney Biennial...

04:22.849 --> 04:24.392
This hurts us both.

04:24.392 --> 04:26.603
But it's not my wound to suture.

04:26.603 --> 04:28.188
Claire must be the surgeon.

04:28.188 --> 04:30.607
Only she can stop the bleeding.

04:32.442 --> 04:35.236
You know we got
them plates in there.

04:35.236 --> 04:37.030
All the changes
you asked for.

04:37.030 --> 04:39.407
Gave you five more points
on the post-recoupment share.

04:39.407 --> 04:41.910
Approval over all the
marketing materials.

04:41.910 --> 04:45.121
Approval over the staff hires of the
flagship in Silver Spring.

04:46.748 --> 04:49.542
- So, what next?
- You sign.

04:49.542 --> 04:52.587
- And I get my $95,000?
- By the end of the week.

04:52.587 --> 04:55.715
Just have to wire it from our
main account into the LLC,

04:55.715 --> 04:57.675
cut a cashier's check for you.

04:57.675 --> 05:00.219
Oh. I want to show you this.

05:00.219 --> 05:02.263
It's a mockup of
the bottle design.

05:02.263 --> 05:06.142
And we already started
on the concept layouts

05:06.142 --> 05:09.062
for the
Silver Spring location.

05:11.356 --> 05:15.777
- Why's that linoleum peeling up?
- To make it seem real.

05:17.070 --> 05:19.280
Well, I wanted it
to look nicer than this.

05:19.280 --> 05:24.118
We can scratch the peeling linoleum,
but we don't want it to look too nice.

05:24.118 --> 05:26.871
You want them white folks
to feel like they slummin' it.

05:26.871 --> 05:30.750
- No, to have an authentic atmosphere.
- And I get to play the nigger.

05:30.750 --> 05:33.002
Look, Freddy,
you know how this works.

05:33.002 --> 05:35.338
They don't just want the ribs,
they want the experience,

05:35.338 --> 05:37.548
but without having
to leave the suburbs for it.

05:37.548 --> 05:40.134
We're not selling
candlelit dinners here.

05:40.134 --> 05:44.222
But I promise, nothing gets
built without your signing off.

05:54.023 --> 05:55.566
<i>So,</i>
<i>what do you want me to do?</i>

05:55.566 --> 05:59.153
- I need you to deny it.
-<i> The affair?</i>

05:59.153 --> 06:02.865
The affair, taking the
photograph, everything.

06:02.865 --> 06:06.494
We have a public history.
I donated work for your...

06:06.494 --> 06:08.454
<i>You can say we had</i>
<i>a business relationship,</i>

06:08.454 --> 06:10.998
<i>but that you didn't</i>
<i>take the picture of me</i>

06:10.998 --> 06:13.334
in the bed.

06:13.334 --> 06:17.630
It was Photoshopped.
Whatever it is you need to say.

06:17.630 --> 06:21.551
I'm so sorry, Claire.
I only have one print and it's still here.

06:21.551 --> 06:24.804
<i>You have to destroy</i>
<i>it. The digital file also.</i>

06:24.804 --> 06:27.974
<i>- But e-mail us a copy first.</i>
- Why?

06:27.974 --> 06:31.769
We need to make sure that there's nothing
in the image that links to your studio.

06:31.769 --> 06:34.313
<i>Whatever</i>
<i>you think is best.</i>

06:35.189 --> 06:36.399
Thank you, Adam.

06:40.361 --> 06:42.196
I watched you...

06:42.196 --> 06:45.616
<i>...when you did</i>
<i>the CNN interview.</i>

06:45.616 --> 06:50.371
<i>I promised myself I wouldn't,</i>
<i>but I couldn't help it.</i>

06:50.371 --> 06:55.209
<i>It's a shame it takes this</i>
<i>for us to talk to one another.</i>

06:55.209 --> 06:58.337
You're well, besides this?

06:58.337 --> 07:02.633
<i>Yeah. I spent three months in Colombia
after you came up here to work,</i>

07:02.633 --> 07:04.802
<i>but also to get away.</i>

07:04.802 --> 07:08.598
<i>- I met someone.</i>
<i>-</i> Oh.

07:08.598 --> 07:12.560
<i>She's from Bogotá.</i>
<i>She's working for an NGO there.</i>

07:12.560 --> 07:16.731
<i>Her name's Inez.</i>
<i>She's living with me now.</i>

07:16.731 --> 07:20.443
Wow. That...
Things happened quickly.

07:20.443 --> 07:23.988
<i>Yeah. They did.</i>

07:25.698 --> 07:26.866
I should go.

07:26.866 --> 07:29.202
So I won't talk to the press

07:29.202 --> 07:31.120
until I get instructions.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.873
<i>That's right.</i>

07:33.873 --> 07:38.211
- It's good to hear your voice.
- You too.

07:44.008 --> 07:46.385
- You finished?
- Yeah.

08:11.077 --> 08:14.372
- Smack, crack, blow.
- No, thanks.

08:14.372 --> 08:16.457
Come on, old man.
We got what you need.

08:16.457 --> 08:18.250
I don't need anything.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.544
Gotta buy somethin'
if you want to get inside.

08:20.544 --> 08:23.923
- Get out the way.
- What?

08:23.923 --> 08:28.344
For real. You need to get
the fuck on outta my way.

08:29.887 --> 08:31.472
I'm just fuckin'
with you, nigga.

08:32.807 --> 08:34.933
Chill the fuck out.

08:53.619 --> 08:57.373
- Who are you?
- Your grandfather.

08:57.373 --> 08:59.333
Open up.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.961
<i>- What's your plan?</i>
- Work from home.

09:01.961 --> 09:04.505
You don't need me dragging
this circus to the White House.

09:04.505 --> 09:06.340
<i>I mean in terms</i>
<i>of a statement.</i>

09:06.340 --> 09:08.592
We're drafting one.
Short and sweet.

09:08.592 --> 09:11.137
<i>Forgive me, Frank,</i>
<i>but you know I have to ask.</i>

09:11.137 --> 09:13.305
If it were true,
I would tell you, sir.

09:13.305 --> 09:15.891
<i>Would you like me to go on</i>
<i>record? Say I stand beside--</i>

09:15.891 --> 09:18.519
No, no, no. I appreciate that,
Mr. President, but you shouldn't

09:18.519 --> 09:21.147
dirty your hands
with this sort of garbage.

09:21.147 --> 09:27.111
If the press corners you, just tell them
you don't engage in gossip mongering.

09:27.111 --> 09:30.781
Sir, it seems Mr. Galloway
is about to appear on television.

09:30.781 --> 09:32.908
<i>Go. Let me know if there's</i>
<i>anything I can do.</i>

09:32.908 --> 09:34.660
Thank you, sir.

09:34.660 --> 09:37.329
<i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>I have very little to say.</i>

09:37.329 --> 09:40.249
<i>Only that I never had any</i>
<i>romantic involvement</i>

09:40.249 --> 09:43.169
<i>with Claire Underwood,</i>
<i>and that I did not take</i>

09:43.169 --> 09:45.463
<i>the photograph printed</i>
<i>in the</i> DC Daily.

09:45.463 --> 09:47.673
<i>I'm sorry that the vice</i>
<i>president and his wife</i>

09:47.673 --> 09:49.884
<i>have to go through</i>
<i>this ridiculous ordeal.</i>

09:49.884 --> 09:54.930
<i>And I would ask that the media leave
both my fiancée and me out of it.</i>

09:54.930 --> 09:56.348
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:56.348 --> 09:59.310
You'll be ready
in an hour?

09:59.310 --> 10:01.270
- Yes. We'll be ready.
- Uh...

10:01.270 --> 10:02.771
You might want to change
into something more...

10:02.771 --> 10:04.690
- Conservative?
- Uh, yes.

10:04.690 --> 10:07.026
I'm gonna go throw
the hounds a bone.

10:09.695 --> 10:14.158
- I know it's demeaning...
- Not another word.

10:14.158 --> 10:16.202
I should've been
more careful.

10:16.202 --> 10:20.080
We'll put this behind us,
just like we've always done.

10:21.624 --> 10:26.378
- Part of me wishes...
- What?

10:26.378 --> 10:29.256
That you'd be more upset.

10:31.175 --> 10:33.928
Tusk came after you
because of me.

10:33.928 --> 10:36.639
It's you who
should be upset.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.728
Wasted energy, isn't it?

10:42.728 --> 10:44.813
For both of us.

10:46.398 --> 10:48.609
Shall we rehearse?

10:51.528 --> 10:54.156
- I don't need your help.
- This ain't a handout.

10:54.156 --> 10:57.868
You have to pay me back
over time. Work for it.

10:57.868 --> 11:01.288
Work for you?

11:01.288 --> 11:03.582
I'm gonna get the
house either way.

11:03.582 --> 11:05.709
Whether you choose
to live in it is up to you.

11:05.709 --> 11:07.711
Yeah, just what I need.
You in the easy chair,

11:07.711 --> 11:09.797
laying into me every time
I come in and out the door.

11:09.797 --> 11:15.261
The place is for you and DeShawn.
I'm gonna be at my own apartment.

11:15.261 --> 11:17.304
You sure this nigga ain't
just sellin' you smoke?

11:17.304 --> 11:22.184
Says it right in the contract,
95 Gs no matter what.

11:24.103 --> 11:27.106
I don't know, man.

11:27.106 --> 11:30.609
I mean, five years I don't see you,
then you come knockin' on the door,

11:30.609 --> 11:32.569
- talking about you got 95 Gs?
- Your choice.

11:32.569 --> 11:34.947
You didn't want me
to visit you no more in jail

11:34.947 --> 11:37.241
- and you didn't want to see me after.
- Still don't wanna see you.

11:37.241 --> 11:38.742
Well, here I am.

11:38.742 --> 11:41.412
Get the fuck outta here,
old man.

11:43.247 --> 11:46.875
You listen to me, boy.

11:46.875 --> 11:48.877
I never had nothing
to give you.

11:48.877 --> 11:53.048
I didn't have no money,
and you didn't want whatever I had.

11:53.048 --> 11:55.509
But we talking
about a house.

11:55.509 --> 11:59.430
DeShawn deserves to live better
than in a place like this.

11:59.430 --> 12:03.017
This ain't about him.
It's about you.

12:05.352 --> 12:07.312
You know where to find me.

12:09.231 --> 12:11.233
See you, kid.

12:15.237 --> 12:17.156
- Less than 30 minutes.
- Are they going to deny?

12:17.156 --> 12:19.658
I'm gonna let the vice president
and his wife speak for themselves.

12:19.658 --> 12:23.328
- Have they been in contact
with Mr. Galloway? - No, they haven't.

12:23.328 --> 12:25.414
Why has it taken them
almost a full day to respond?

12:25.414 --> 12:28.417
I'm sure you can understand they
wanted to consult with legal counsel first

12:28.417 --> 12:30.002
regarding defamation
and slander.

12:30.002 --> 12:32.087
You're saying they
will deny the affair.

12:32.087 --> 12:33.589
I'm saying they'll
be out here in 30 minutes

12:33.589 --> 12:35.257
and you can quote them
instead of me.

12:35.257 --> 12:36.800
Thank you all very much
for your patience.

12:36.800 --> 12:40.471
- I hate this.
- What, waiting?

12:40.471 --> 12:44.975
No, the affair. It's bullshit.
I feel like a tabloid hack.

12:44.975 --> 12:49.313
You'd rather be stuck
at the White House all day?

12:49.313 --> 12:52.191
- Fuck this.
- Where are you going?

12:52.191 --> 12:55.652
To do something
meaningful with my time.

12:58.572 --> 13:01.241
Hey, I need you to book me
a flight to St. Louis.

13:01.241 --> 13:04.077
Tonight, if you
can find something.

13:13.253 --> 13:18.008
No Q&A, so don't even try.
Behave yourselves, people.

13:21.929 --> 13:26.767
I find it very painful
that anyone would suggest

13:26.767 --> 13:31.730
I'm capable of being unfaithful to
my husband, whom I love dearly.

13:31.730 --> 13:36.902
<i>I've known Adam Galloway</i>
<i>for years. We both have.</i>

13:36.902 --> 13:38.987
<i>When I ran the</i>
<i>Clean Water Initiative,</i>

13:38.987 --> 13:41.323
<i>I commissioned him to do</i>
<i>a series of photographs</i>

13:41.323 --> 13:44.243
for the marketing campaign.
And he was extremely generous

13:44.243 --> 13:47.412
by donating work for our
fund-raising auctions.

13:47.412 --> 13:52.042
So I'm not sure why he would
deny taking the photograph.

13:54.127 --> 13:57.881
<i>I love Adam's work, so I asked
him to take this portrait.</i>

13:57.881 --> 14:03.095
We did it here, at the house. Francis
was there during the shoot.

14:03.095 --> 14:07.307
It was a birthday present. Claire asked me
what sort of portrait I wanted,

14:07.307 --> 14:09.268
and I said I want
one of her sleeping,

14:09.268 --> 14:13.188
<i>because she's so very beautiful</i>
<i>when she's sleeping.</i>

14:13.188 --> 14:15.607
<i>It hangs in my office</i>
<i>on the second floor.</i>

14:15.607 --> 14:17.859
They're fucking lying.

14:17.859 --> 14:22.781
<i>So I can only assume that Adam</i>
<i>was intimidated by the media attention,</i>

14:22.781 --> 14:26.159
<i>- and he needed to distance himself.</i>
- What?

14:26.159 --> 14:29.496
<i>But really, all we have here</i>
<i>is a very talented photographer</i>

14:29.496 --> 14:34.918
<i>- and a prized possession. Thank you
all very much.</i> <i>- Thank you.</i>

14:34.918 --> 14:38.714
Because it would've seemed too clean
otherwise, like we were--

14:38.714 --> 14:42.342
<i>You made me</i>
<i>look like an idiot.</i>

14:42.342 --> 14:47.180
If we had the same story, the media
would assume we were coordinating.

14:47.180 --> 14:50.392
- It needed to look messier.
<i>- This was supposed to go away, Claire.</i>

14:50.392 --> 14:53.145
I've got twice as much press
outside the building now.

14:53.145 --> 14:55.480
<i>- Adam...</i>
- I've gotta keep the lights off

14:55.480 --> 14:58.442
'cause they're on the roof
across the street trying to film us inside.

14:58.442 --> 15:02.571
You just need to confirm
that you took the photo for us.

15:02.571 --> 15:06.533
Confirm our version.
Say you lied because you were scared.

15:06.533 --> 15:09.536
I don't know why you didn't just tell me
this is what you were intending to do.

15:09.536 --> 15:15.083
<i>Because I know you, and you
would've refused. You have too much pride.</i>

15:15.083 --> 15:19.337
- I don't want to speak to the press again.
<i>- Listen.</i>

15:19.337 --> 15:21.965
<i>If you say nothing, they're not going</i>
<i>to leave you alone.</i>

15:21.965 --> 15:24.176
<i>They will just camp out</i>
<i>for weeks on end--</i>

15:24.176 --> 15:27.637
This is... it feels wrong,
Claire. It feels...

15:27.637 --> 15:30.265
I'm sorry I lied.

15:30.265 --> 15:32.893
<i>I wasn't trying to be</i>
<i>manipulative--</i>

15:32.893 --> 15:38.607
- I have to go.
- Adam? Adam?

15:41.443 --> 15:43.779
I think he'll
do the right thing.

15:43.779 --> 15:46.823
I don't know. I hope so.

15:48.617 --> 15:53.121
- Cigarette?
- No. I'm gonna turn in.

15:53.121 --> 15:55.540
Wake me if he goes on TV.

16:04.674 --> 16:07.761
- <i> Sir.</i>

16:07.761 --> 16:13.767
- Doug, why don't you and Seth come over?
-<i> Yes, sir.</i>

16:13.767 --> 16:16.394
Should we consider a lawsuit
against the paper?

16:16.394 --> 16:19.815
- Show we won't tolerate this
sort of gossip? - They won't settle.

16:19.815 --> 16:22.442
They'll fight it in the courts because
it'll generate more news.

16:22.442 --> 16:24.778
And what about the president?
He offered to say something.

16:24.778 --> 16:26.822
- Draws attention.
- President isn't a bad idea,

16:26.822 --> 16:28.406
if we phrase
a statement for him.

16:28.406 --> 16:29.616
He becomes the headline.

16:29.616 --> 16:30.867
We can't control
his press operation.

16:30.867 --> 16:32.369
If we coordinate
with them--

16:32.369 --> 16:33.662
Coordination looks bad.

16:33.662 --> 16:35.705
So it's your job
to conceal it.

16:35.705 --> 16:38.208
If Seth doesn't think the president
should make a comment,

16:38.208 --> 16:41.044
we should defer to his judgment.
I'm gonna get another beer.

16:41.044 --> 16:43.338
- I can go grab you one.
- No. I feel like stretching my legs.

16:43.338 --> 16:45.215
- Doug, Diet Coke?
- I'm fine, thank you, sir.

16:45.215 --> 16:47.592
- Seth, a beer?
- I have to drive, but thanks.

16:47.592 --> 16:49.761
I'll be right back.

16:55.183 --> 16:58.812
- Watch yourself.
- What do you mean?

16:58.812 --> 17:02.899
Connor was an easy target,
but I'm not going anywhere.

17:02.899 --> 17:04.858
Look, Doug,
I'm grateful just to be here.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.028
You think I've survived
with the vice president

17:07.028 --> 17:09.573
so long by being blind?

17:09.573 --> 17:12.242
Upward mobility has
a ceiling with the Underwoods.

17:12.242 --> 17:17.038
- I'm the ceiling.
- Understood.

17:17.038 --> 17:20.250
- What else have you got on them?
- Nothing.

17:20.250 --> 17:23.920
You fork over the journal without a backup
plan for a rainy day? I don't think so.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.923
I had one hand and I played it.
I don't press my luck.

17:26.923 --> 17:30.093
- You can't expect me to believe you.
- I don't.

17:30.093 --> 17:33.513
I wouldn't if I were you.
But I'm telling the truth.

17:37.017 --> 17:41.646
A little sibling rivalry isn't such a bad
thing, especially between adopted boys.

17:41.646 --> 17:44.774
They either push each other
to be the best versions of themselves,

17:44.774 --> 17:47.110
or one of them gets booted
back to the orphanage.

17:47.110 --> 17:51.323
You're in my house.
You drink if I drink.

17:51.323 --> 17:55.035
One Diet Coke for you,
and one beer for you.

17:55.035 --> 17:56.870
Thank you, sir.

17:58.246 --> 18:00.623
Oh, darling,
what a mess.

18:00.623 --> 18:04.252
Sweetheart.
How are you holding up?

18:04.252 --> 18:06.671
The press have been
harassing us the past two days.

18:06.671 --> 18:09.466
Yeah, we barely made it out
of the building without being trampled.

18:09.466 --> 18:12.427
- Oh, how awful.
- You said someone was here to see me?

18:12.427 --> 18:14.637
- He's in my office.
- Did he tell you who he was?

18:14.637 --> 18:17.140
I didn't want to say over the phone.
You never know, these days.

18:17.140 --> 18:20.477
He says he used
to work for the Underwoods.

18:28.526 --> 18:30.528
- Who?
- Your assistant.

18:30.528 --> 18:33.782
- No, she would never--
- She would and she did.

18:33.782 --> 18:36.284
- Why are you doing this?
- Not me. The man I work for.

18:36.284 --> 18:39.120
- And who is that?
- That doesn't concern you.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.081
This is my life
you're fucking with.

18:41.081 --> 18:42.707
You and I are just
pawns, Mr. Galloway.

18:42.707 --> 18:46.669
- You should leave.
- We need more...

18:46.669 --> 18:48.963
...to prove the affair happened.
Another photograph.

18:48.963 --> 18:50.715
Thirty seconds,
you better be out the door.

18:50.715 --> 18:53.218
I'm not going anywhere.

18:55.512 --> 18:57.931
You recognize
the country code?

19:00.100 --> 19:02.268
And the city code is Bogotá.

19:03.978 --> 19:08.775
Is it still ringing?

19:10.318 --> 19:13.905
- Marshall!
- Hey, Pops.

19:16.574 --> 19:21.412
Man, never seen it like this before.
The line's down the block.

19:21.412 --> 19:24.123
Something else, ain't it?

19:24.123 --> 19:26.167
Looks like you could
use some help.

19:27.794 --> 19:30.630
Got a extra apron
in the back.

19:36.010 --> 19:39.430
Let's go!

19:39.430 --> 19:42.684
<i>She</i>
<i>refuses to leave the lobby.</i>

19:42.684 --> 19:44.352
What's her name?

19:44.352 --> 19:47.188
<i>Ayla Sayyad,</i>
Wall Street Telegraph.

19:47.188 --> 19:50.275
<i>She's part of the</i>
<i>vice president's press corps.</i>

19:51.401 --> 19:54.195
Oh, yeah.

19:54.195 --> 19:56.531
Send her up.

19:56.531 --> 19:59.450
I appreciate it,
Tricia, but I'm fine.

19:59.450 --> 20:03.121
This whole thing will blow over
in a day or so, and I'll...

20:03.121 --> 20:05.415
Can you hold on one second?

20:05.415 --> 20:09.711
- The <i> Daily.</i> They called for a comment.
- Did Adam speak with them?

20:09.711 --> 20:13.464
Yes, but not what we told him
to say. He sent them this.

20:15.425 --> 20:17.010
Tricia, can I call you back?

20:17.010 --> 20:19.762
- Is that you?
- No.

20:19.762 --> 20:22.056
Because he's saying it is.

20:23.641 --> 20:25.893
- It might be.
- Mrs. Underwood.

20:25.893 --> 20:28.938
I mean, it could be, yes.

20:28.938 --> 20:31.065
It probably is.

20:31.065 --> 20:34.152
I asked you about
any vulnerabilities.

20:36.195 --> 20:39.449
I didn't know he took this.

20:39.449 --> 20:44.078
You have short hair in the picture.
You said it ended over two years ago.

20:44.078 --> 20:46.914
Well, I visited
him last fall.

20:46.914 --> 20:48.666
Does anyone else know?
Did anyone see you there?

20:48.666 --> 20:51.252
He had friends over,
to his apartment.

20:51.252 --> 20:53.129
Christ.

20:53.129 --> 20:54.964
But we've said
that he's a friend.

20:54.964 --> 20:58.551
There's nothing wrong
with me visiting him, being at a party.

20:58.551 --> 21:01.679
There is if this photo
is on the front page of the <i> Daily.</i>

21:05.516 --> 21:09.896
Politics and business are intertwined
in China, as I'm sure you know.

21:09.896 --> 21:15.651
It's not uncommon to partner with someone
who can ensure Beijing's approval.

21:15.651 --> 21:17.987
So you needed his
political influence.

21:17.987 --> 21:21.491
All this is moot.
Our venture fell through.

21:21.491 --> 21:23.993
Right after the Port Jefferson
Bridge was approved.

21:23.993 --> 21:26.996
Well, I had nothing to do
with that project.

21:26.996 --> 21:32.126
- Neither did Feng, to my knowledge.
- No, but Wu Bin Yang did.

21:32.126 --> 21:35.088
He's Feng's biggest
rival in Beijing.

21:35.088 --> 21:38.925
Well, it looks like I shouldn't be schooling
you on Chinese politics.

21:38.925 --> 21:42.136
You know far more than I.

21:42.136 --> 21:43.971
You used the word "intertwined."

21:43.971 --> 21:46.808
That's the sense I'm getting
from all of this.

21:46.808 --> 21:50.394
The samarium subsidy,
the Chinese refinery, the bridge,

21:50.394 --> 21:52.772
- your friendship with the president...
- Who sent you?

21:52.772 --> 21:56.192
Who sent me?

21:56.192 --> 21:59.237
When you're as rich as I am,
you're always a target.

21:59.237 --> 22:04.909
- Nobody sent me.
- You're here... in St. Louis.

22:04.909 --> 22:08.621
Instead of covering
the vice president and his wife.

22:08.621 --> 22:12.875
My gut says there's more to
Xander Feng than has been reported.

22:12.875 --> 22:17.255
It's a far better use of my time
than reporting on tabloid sex scandals.

22:17.255 --> 22:20.007
It's not real news.

22:22.009 --> 22:28.474
You miss Tehran. I read some of your
work while you were in the waiting area.

22:28.474 --> 22:31.561
- It started to get too dangerous.
- Ooh! Yeah.

22:31.561 --> 22:34.438
Not the best place to be when you
want to get married and start a family.

22:34.438 --> 22:37.400
- Or if you're Jewish.
- That too.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.486
My wife got this for me

22:40.486 --> 22:44.657
when she visited there
before the revolution.

22:44.657 --> 22:47.243
- It's beautiful.
- Sixteenth century.

22:47.243 --> 22:53.040
It, um, broke when it was
being shipped, into a thousand pieces.

22:53.040 --> 22:57.879
It took specialists
over a year

22:57.879 --> 22:59.589
to restore it.

22:59.589 --> 23:03.426
- Here, I want you to have it.
- I can't accept gifts.

23:03.426 --> 23:05.553
No, no. Not as a gift. No.

23:05.553 --> 23:11.267
As a reminder of how hard it can
be to put something back together again

23:11.267 --> 23:13.686
once it's been crushed.

23:13.686 --> 23:17.607
If you're going to threaten me, you don't
have to go to the trouble of veiling it.

23:17.607 --> 23:22.987
I don't usually do interviews
with reporters. They're parasites.

23:22.987 --> 23:28.618
Usually interested in just finding
a way to knock me down a peg.

23:28.618 --> 23:32.455
Invariably, what
they write is inaccurate.

23:32.455 --> 23:37.668
And when that happens,
I have no choice but to retaliate.

23:41.505 --> 23:46.427
America can be just
as dangerous as Iran, Ms. Sayyad.

23:54.560 --> 23:57.021
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Tusk.

23:57.021 --> 24:00.566
Travel safe back
to Washington.

24:10.076 --> 24:12.453
Get Remy on the line.

24:14.872 --> 24:17.875
<i>- Remy's on line two.</i>
- Remy.

24:17.875 --> 24:23.214
Let's not hold back on the other thing.
Hit 'em again, and hit 'em now.

24:23.214 --> 24:26.258
Best day yet.

24:26.258 --> 24:28.469
You gotta get
a safe or something.

24:28.469 --> 24:31.138
Or maybe one of those,
uh, pickup services.

24:31.138 --> 24:33.265
That's too much money to be
carrying around at night.

24:33.265 --> 24:34.809
I can handle myself.

24:34.809 --> 24:37.520
There ain't nobody can handle
a Glock to the face.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.730
Unless you got
one yourself.

24:39.730 --> 24:44.026
My days of packin'
are long gone.

24:47.154 --> 24:52.743
There. Take mine.
I got one at home.

24:52.743 --> 24:55.621
What the fuck you doin'
bringin' that thing in here?

24:55.621 --> 24:57.581
Oh, it's just
for protection, man.

24:57.581 --> 24:59.500
I don't know what you doing
with it anyway.

24:59.500 --> 25:00.918
What about your parole?

25:00.918 --> 25:02.378
I'm a lot more worried
about niggas

25:02.378 --> 25:04.630
in my building
than some parole officer.

25:04.630 --> 25:06.090
- All right, sit down.
- See, man?

25:06.090 --> 25:08.092
This is what I'm
talkin' about, man.

25:08.092 --> 25:09.885
You being all righteous
and judgin' me and shit.

25:09.885 --> 25:14.014
Do me a favor and just
sit down. Sit down now.

25:24.275 --> 25:26.944
Look.

25:26.944 --> 25:30.156
We got us a good thing,
potentially.

25:30.156 --> 25:33.909
Maybe nothin' comes of it,
but maybe something does.

25:33.909 --> 25:37.413
If the Joint works out,
maybe one day you can be the manager.

25:37.413 --> 25:40.833
Shit, if it blows up, you can
run the whole fuckin' franchise.

25:40.833 --> 25:44.086
But that means
you gotta be careful.

25:44.086 --> 25:48.382
That means you cannot
be sent back inside.

25:48.382 --> 25:53.762
We gotta follow the rules.
Hear me?

25:56.473 --> 25:59.351
- All right.
- You gonna get rid of that thing?

26:00.352 --> 26:05.274
- Yeah.
- All right.

26:05.274 --> 26:08.360
Now that's what's being a man.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.827
I'll need you to cut it.

26:16.827 --> 26:18.537
How short?

26:20.080 --> 26:22.458
This short.

26:22.458 --> 26:24.835
I have a modeling career.
If I cut it that short--

26:24.835 --> 26:26.712
If you actually
had a modeling career,

26:26.712 --> 26:29.214
I would be speaking
to your agency,

26:29.214 --> 26:31.425
and not sitting
in your apartment.

26:31.425 --> 26:35.679
- Do you want this job or not?
- OK, yeah.

26:35.679 --> 26:38.265
- I can cut it.
- All right.

26:38.265 --> 26:44.063
And before we go to the studio,
I need to see how well-spoken you are.

26:44.063 --> 26:46.148
Why does that matter?

26:46.148 --> 26:50.653
Because you're gonna be on
every news channel in America.

26:50.653 --> 26:53.030
Wait, what's this for?

26:54.281 --> 26:56.075
Read this.

26:56.075 --> 26:57.743
Those exact words.

27:02.164 --> 27:05.793
Read 'em. If you're good,
you'll memorize them.

27:07.628 --> 27:10.506
My name is Stephanie Daldry.

27:12.049 --> 27:14.301
I am a professional model.

27:14.301 --> 27:17.012
"Freddy Hayes
was convicted in 1982

27:17.012 --> 27:20.307
for sticking up a convenience
store in Columbia Heights.

27:20.307 --> 27:24.853
During a high-speed pursuit, Hayes lost
control and crashed into another vehicle,

27:24.853 --> 27:26.814
killing an elderly couple.

27:26.814 --> 27:30.818
He avoided manslaughter charges
by pleading guilty to armed robbery.

27:30.818 --> 27:32.945
He served nine years.

27:32.945 --> 27:36.448
In 1992, he opened
Freddy's BBQ Joint,

27:36.448 --> 27:40.160
a small restaurant
specializing in ribs,

27:40.160 --> 27:44.415
frequented by
Vice President Frank Underwood."

27:44.415 --> 27:47.876
- Did you know?
- No, I didn't.

27:47.876 --> 27:50.796
- You think it's Tusk?
- Who else?

27:52.965 --> 27:57.428
- Who are you texting?
- Seth.

28:04.268 --> 28:06.812
All I want to do
is make a short statement.

28:06.812 --> 28:10.691
Freddy did his time, he's been
an upstanding citizen for 20 years.

28:10.691 --> 28:14.194
He's a convicted felon
who killed two senior citizens.

28:14.194 --> 28:16.530
- By accident.
- That's beside the point.

28:16.530 --> 28:18.240
I'm not gonna
hang him out to dry.

28:18.240 --> 28:21.368
If the Galloway story wasn't
happening, I'd say it's fine.

28:21.368 --> 28:23.078
But it's too
risky right now.

28:23.078 --> 28:24.913
Think of how this is shaping up.

28:24.913 --> 28:26.915
A vice president whose wife
cheats on him

28:26.915 --> 28:29.793
and who is friendly
with a former gangbanger?

28:29.793 --> 28:32.045
There is no way you win,
standing up for this guy.

28:32.045 --> 28:34.464
He's about to
start a franchise.

28:34.464 --> 28:36.633
I will not have it jeopardized
because Tusk decided--

28:36.633 --> 28:39.386
It's more than just Freddy, sir.
I did some digging.

28:39.386 --> 28:43.265
His son did time for
narcotics, trafficking, distribution--

28:43.265 --> 28:45.893
- I've never met his son.
- Let's hold off and tackle--

28:45.893 --> 28:48.437
No. I want you to organize
a press avail tomorrow morning.

28:48.437 --> 28:51.190
Have Freddy brought over here.
Bring him through the back.

28:51.190 --> 28:53.025
Yes, sir.

28:54.693 --> 28:58.447
I won't leave one of my own
bleeding on the field.

29:03.744 --> 29:05.704
If you're gonna have
the Washington Redskins,

29:05.704 --> 29:08.582
then you're gonna have
to have the New York Knickers.

29:08.582 --> 29:11.418
Pops, you ain't
even deep like that.

29:11.418 --> 29:14.254
Yo, back off, man. Yo, yo, yo,
yo! Back the fuck off.

29:14.254 --> 29:16.632
- Darnell, just ignore them.
- You think I'm fucking around?

29:16.632 --> 29:18.258
Darnell, ignore them!
Ignore 'em.

29:18.258 --> 29:20.093
They can't take our pictures
if we don't want them to.

29:20.093 --> 29:22.512
- Sure as hell can.
- What you say?

29:22.512 --> 29:23.555
The First fuckin' Amendment.

29:23.555 --> 29:25.182
You gonna read me the

29:25.182 --> 29:26.934
Constitution now, motherfucker?

29:26.934 --> 29:28.435
- Let's go on inside.
- I ain't done with this asshole.

29:28.435 --> 29:29.770
Hey, don't touch me.

29:29.770 --> 29:31.438
Oh, but you can
get all up in my face

29:31.438 --> 29:32.648
but I can't get up in yours?

29:32.648 --> 29:33.815
Listen to your daddy
and chill out.

29:33.815 --> 29:34.816
- Let's go.
- Don't push me.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.485
I will fuck you up.

29:36.485 --> 29:38.820
- You think I'm scared of you?
- You scared of this?

29:38.820 --> 29:40.989
Darnell! Parole!

29:47.913 --> 29:49.706
<i>Can you tell me your</i>
<i>name, please?</i>

29:49.706 --> 29:51.249
<i>Stephanie Daldry.</i>

29:51.249 --> 29:52.960
<i>I'm a professional model.</i>

29:52.960 --> 29:55.754
<i>And this is you in this</i>
<i>photo on the right?</i>

29:55.754 --> 29:59.758
<i>- Yes, that's correct. - We shot this photo
yesterday with Ms. Daldry.</i>

29:59.758 --> 30:02.928
<i>So you're suggesting that</i>
<i>Mr. Galloway's photo is a fake?</i>

30:02.928 --> 30:06.431
<i>I don't know anything about professional
photography, I'm just a flack.</i>

30:06.431 --> 30:09.226
<i>But if we can create a fake</i>
<i>in less than 24 hours,</i>

30:09.226 --> 30:12.020
<i>I think an expert photographer</i>
<i>like Adam Galloway--</i>

30:12.020 --> 30:17.067
<i>Those are serious allegations, especially given
that Mr. Galloway vehemently denies it.</i>

30:17.067 --> 30:19.236
<i>I'm not surprised</i>
<i>he's denying.</i>

30:19.236 --> 30:21.488
<i>Ultimately, though, it's gonna be</i>
<i>your word against his.</i>

30:21.488 --> 30:23.073
<i>Not my word.</i>

30:23.073 --> 30:24.908
<i>The vice president</i>
<i>of the United States'.</i>

30:24.908 --> 30:27.202
<i>It's his word versus that</i>
<i>of a potentially troubled man.</i>

30:27.202 --> 30:29.246
<i>- Troubled?</i>
<i>- Potentially.</i>

30:29.246 --> 30:30.914
<i>Or maybe he has a motive.</i>

30:30.914 --> 30:32.958
<i>What motive</i>
<i>could Mr. Galloway</i>

30:32.958 --> 30:35.377
<i>possibly have</i>
<i>for a fake photo?</i>

30:35.377 --> 30:37.879
<i>- What would he get out of it?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

30:37.879 --> 30:41.299
<i>My job is to separate fact from
fiction, just like yours is, Candy.</i>

30:41.299 --> 30:45.721
<i>But maybe fact and fiction don't matter
as much to the artistic sensibility.</i>

30:45.721 --> 30:47.764
<i>Maybe the lines</i>
<i>are blurred for him.</i>

30:47.764 --> 30:50.726
<i>This is not a man who</i>
<i>stages fictitious scenarios.</i>

30:50.726 --> 30:54.896
<i>Like I said, the art stuff, it's over
my head. And you may be right.</i>

30:54.896 --> 30:56.940
<i>But I would hate</i>
<i>to think that Mr. Galloway</i>

30:56.940 --> 30:58.900
<i>was doing this</i>
<i>just for publicity.</i>

30:58.900 --> 31:00.569
<i>You think it's</i>
<i>a publicity stunt.</i>

31:00.569 --> 31:02.237
Come on in.

31:02.237 --> 31:04.156
- Sir?
- Is Freddy on his way?

31:04.156 --> 31:06.533
There was an incident
with his son.

31:06.533 --> 31:09.077
- What happened?
- He's in custody for threatening

31:09.077 --> 31:13.457
- a photographer with a firearm.
- Jesus.

31:13.457 --> 31:16.585
- Where is Freddy now?
- He's at home.

31:16.585 --> 31:19.254
- I have to go see him.
- That's the projects, sir.

31:19.254 --> 31:22.591
I don't care, you figure it out,
and the press can't know.

31:22.591 --> 31:25.594
Yes, sir.

31:25.594 --> 31:28.555
- Francis, you know I love Freddy...
- I'm going.

31:28.555 --> 31:31.141
Freddy is dangerous
because you care too much.

31:31.141 --> 31:34.603
- When we care too much, it blinds us.
- What Tusk did is cheap.

31:34.603 --> 31:37.147
And you're letting it get to you,
which is exactly what he wants.

31:37.147 --> 31:40.484
- If I ignore this, if I do nothing--
- It's not nothing.

31:40.484 --> 31:43.737
Staying focused
requires strength.

31:53.580 --> 31:57.918
- You want me to make something?
- You go ahead. I'm not hungry.

31:57.918 --> 32:01.296
You should eat.

32:01.296 --> 32:05.050
I'm sorry. You didn't ask for
this. It's not fair to you.

32:05.050 --> 32:10.013
All I want is to be done with it.
For my father to be all right.

32:10.013 --> 32:12.974
If I thought there
was any other way, that...

32:12.974 --> 32:15.018
I didn't want to take
the chance that he would--

32:15.018 --> 32:17.896
- I know.
- These people.

32:17.896 --> 32:21.316
I always knew they
were ruthless, but...

32:21.316 --> 32:26.112
We're caged up in here like animals.
They're painting me as some sort of...

32:26.112 --> 32:30.367
And your family...
It's inhuman.

32:30.367 --> 32:32.285
They're fucking inhuman.

32:32.285 --> 32:34.913
Getting worked up isn't
going to change anything.

32:40.293 --> 32:41.878
Let me.

32:47.467 --> 32:48.635
Hello?

33:15.495 --> 33:19.124
- Hey, Frank.
- I'm fine.

33:19.124 --> 33:22.627
- Thanks for dropping by.
- How you holdin' up?

33:22.627 --> 33:24.796
I been better.

33:26.089 --> 33:28.091
Ain't never seen you
without a suit before.

33:28.091 --> 33:31.761
We didn't want
to draw too much attention.

33:31.761 --> 33:34.931
Well, this is it, my castle.

33:34.931 --> 33:38.309
Ain't as big as yours,
but it'll do the job.

33:38.309 --> 33:41.855
- Blind Willie.
- Are you a blues fan?

33:41.855 --> 33:45.483
"Dark Was the Night."
Gets me every time.

33:45.483 --> 33:48.486
Man, you shoulda
told me that years ago.

33:48.486 --> 33:52.282
I can jam, talking about
some blues all day long.

33:52.282 --> 33:54.701
Check this out. Original 78.

33:54.701 --> 33:57.871
You want something?
Water? Iced tea?

33:57.871 --> 34:00.582
I'd like some iced tea,
thank you.

34:03.460 --> 34:08.172
- How's your son?
- They set the bail at 60 grand.

34:08.172 --> 34:13.344
- Jesus.
- How's your wife doing?

34:13.344 --> 34:16.347
Oh, Claire's got a suit
of armor three inches thick.

34:16.347 --> 34:18.224
We'll get through
all this garbage.

34:18.224 --> 34:23.188
- Somebody's tryin' to take you out?
- Appears that way.

34:23.188 --> 34:27.859
Whoever it is, they done stepped on
the wrong motherfuckin' rattlesnake.

34:31.612 --> 34:33.322
That's why I'm here, Freddy.

34:41.623 --> 34:44.167
I have to distance
myself from you.

34:44.167 --> 34:48.338
I need to make sure you're not going to
play up what good friends we've been.

34:48.338 --> 34:52.759
That you've been to my office,
that you've cooked dinner at my home,

34:52.759 --> 34:55.219
or that the president was there.

34:55.219 --> 34:58.515
We can't drag him
into anything.

35:00.183 --> 35:03.770
And I won't be coming in
for ribs anymore.

35:03.770 --> 35:08.358
With all that's going on,
we can't add fuel to the fire.

35:10.902 --> 35:13.321
You couldn't if you wanted to.

35:13.321 --> 35:16.074
I'm selling it.

35:16.074 --> 35:19.035
- Selling the Joint?
- That's right.

35:19.035 --> 35:23.081
- What are you talking about?
- The franchise thing, with the sauce.

35:23.081 --> 35:25.792
My business partner's
pullin' out.

35:25.792 --> 35:30.880
Say them white folks down in Silver Spring
don't wanna go to no place run by thugs.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.841
- Why do you have to sell yours?
- Darnell's bail.

35:33.841 --> 35:36.511
Well, doesn't that guy have to give
you a hundred grand, regardless?

35:36.511 --> 35:42.433
I ain't getting shit.
There's a morality clause in the contract.

35:42.433 --> 35:46.437
But he's gonna pay me
45 thou for the storefront.

35:46.437 --> 35:50.733
That, with what little I got
saved, I can pay that bond.

35:50.733 --> 35:54.279
- You can't sell Freddy's.
- He's already drawin' up the papers.

35:54.279 --> 35:56.447
- Let me help you with the money.
- Nah, Frank.

35:56.447 --> 35:58.032
We'll make it a loan.
You can pay me back.

35:58.032 --> 35:59.784
- Not gonna happen.
- Don't be prideful.

35:59.784 --> 36:01.202
- Frank.
- Please, let me help.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.037
I ain't takin' your guilt money.

36:09.252 --> 36:14.340
When I was bangin',
we used to clear 60 Gs a month.

36:14.340 --> 36:18.594
I seen guys shot down
execution-style.

36:18.594 --> 36:20.763
I didn't give a shit.

36:20.763 --> 36:23.182
Then I got caught.

36:23.182 --> 36:26.185
Darnell was
born my first year in.

36:26.185 --> 36:29.105
Never saw him once,
not even a picture.

36:29.105 --> 36:34.652
I can't take
back the bad I done.

36:34.652 --> 36:39.866
All I can do is to make my own way,
like I been doin'. You understand.

36:41.492 --> 36:44.620
Ain't pride, Frank.

37:05.641 --> 37:09.228
If you change your mind,
you let me know.

37:09.228 --> 37:11.439
You was a good
customer, that's it.

37:12.607 --> 37:16.068
You ain't gotta pretend
to be my friend.

37:16.068 --> 37:21.824
- You take care of yourself, Freddy.
- You too, Frank.

37:31.918 --> 37:34.587
Do you think I'm a hypocrite?

37:35.546 --> 37:38.549
Well, you should.

37:38.549 --> 37:41.969
I wouldn't disagree with you.

37:41.969 --> 37:46.557
The road to power is paved
with hypocrisy...

37:46.557 --> 37:48.851
...and casualties.

37:50.394 --> 37:53.105
Never regret.

38:17.672 --> 38:19.966
This way.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.060
Have a seat, Adam.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.985
You left your phone at home,
as you were asked?

38:38.985 --> 38:43.781
- Yeah. - And what did you tell
your fiancée exactly?

38:43.781 --> 38:46.742
That I'd be gone for a while.
She doesn't know where.

38:46.742 --> 38:49.704
And what will she say
if someone checks in on her?

38:49.704 --> 38:51.455
- What is this?
- What will she say?

38:51.455 --> 38:53.749
Francis.

38:53.749 --> 38:56.919
- We need to work together now.
- I tried. You lied to me.

38:56.919 --> 38:59.338
And I explained to you
why that was necessary.

38:59.338 --> 39:02.091
You didn't follow
my instructions.

39:05.845 --> 39:07.471
Do you know
who Remy Danton is?

39:08.681 --> 39:10.933
He approached you?

39:10.933 --> 39:14.645
Inez's father is a human
rights activist in Bogotá.

39:14.645 --> 39:18.941
The government has charged him
with treason for working with the rebels.

39:18.941 --> 39:20.609
They're going
for the death penalty,

39:20.609 --> 39:23.487
and Danton said they
have the judge in their pocket.

39:23.487 --> 39:25.948
- You should have come to us.
- Well, I said I would.

39:25.948 --> 39:29.535
- Danton said you couldn't do anything.
- He's wrong.

39:29.535 --> 39:32.246
- I wasn't gonna take any chances.
- Has he done what

39:32.246 --> 39:34.707
- the government's claiming?
- No. They're made-up charges.

39:34.707 --> 39:38.419
He's a journalist documenting
atrocities in the Darien Gap.

39:38.419 --> 39:40.588
- I can get the charges dropped.
- Why should I trust you?

39:40.588 --> 39:43.883
Because the secretary of state
is a good friend of mine.

39:43.883 --> 39:47.636
- And you don't have any other choice.
- We're not your chess pieces.

39:47.636 --> 39:49.138
And this isn't a game,
Mr. Galloway.

39:49.138 --> 39:50.931
Then why are you
toying with us?

39:50.931 --> 39:52.308
We are trying to help.

39:52.308 --> 39:53.893
That's a fucking joke,
Claire.

39:53.893 --> 39:57.229
Do not talk
to my wife that way.

39:57.229 --> 40:00.316
Oh, your wife?
What does that even mean to you?

40:00.316 --> 40:03.652
Do not mistake any history
you have shared

40:03.652 --> 40:07.198
for the slightest understanding
of what our marriage is,

40:07.198 --> 40:11.786
or how insignificant
you are in comparison.

40:15.915 --> 40:20.127
- Can you give us a few minutes?
- I'm gonna go call Cathy.

40:25.800 --> 40:28.844
Forget my career and my reputation.
I want to marry this woman, Claire.

40:28.844 --> 40:30.888
We're going to make
this disappear.

40:30.888 --> 40:33.724
Because of you, I will always be the man
who placed her father in danger.

40:33.724 --> 40:36.435
- I can never erase that.
- I'm sorry it's come to this.

40:36.435 --> 40:41.023
I'm sorry I ever met you.
All you've ever done is cause me pain.

40:41.023 --> 40:42.983
Now you're fucking with my life
and the life of the woman

40:42.983 --> 40:45.027
that I love more
than I ever loved you.

40:49.490 --> 40:51.742
You'll be driven
back to New York tonight.

40:51.742 --> 40:54.578
In the morning, you'll make a statement
saying this was a publicity stunt,

40:54.578 --> 40:59.291
and that the value of your work had been
stagnating and you wanted to revive--

40:59.291 --> 41:01.418
- No, Claire. I won't do that.
- Yes, you will.

41:01.418 --> 41:05.130
- How about I tell the press--
- Adam, shut up!

41:05.130 --> 41:08.050
That you wanted the attention,
then you got cold feet,

41:08.050 --> 41:10.678
denied it, then you
changed your mind again.

41:10.678 --> 41:13.597
And that you faked the shower
photo and you're coming clean.

41:13.597 --> 41:18.435
- Is that clear?
- I'm not part of this world.

41:18.435 --> 41:22.481
I didn't sign up for it.
I have no interest in it.

41:22.481 --> 41:25.734
We're giving you an out, Adam.

41:25.734 --> 41:29.071
And if you choose
not to take it,

41:29.071 --> 41:31.824
I will bury you.

41:34.868 --> 41:37.621
I've never hated anyone before.

41:39.957 --> 41:42.501
Now I know what that feels like.

41:46.171 --> 41:49.091
It's a terrible feeling,
isn't it?

42:12.698 --> 42:16.327
- End call.
<i>-  Call ended.</i>

42:18.370 --> 42:21.206
Call Raymond Tusk.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.834
<i>No answer at his place.</i>

42:23.834 --> 42:25.669
Is it a matter of more money?

42:25.669 --> 42:28.213
<i>Secretary Durant has already</i>
<i>called President Moreno.</i>

42:28.213 --> 42:29.882
So we need to move quickly.

42:29.882 --> 42:32.176
<i>The minister of foreign affairs</i>
<i>is involved now.</i>

42:32.176 --> 42:35.346
<i>The judge isn't gonna rush a conviction</i>
<i>in less than 12 hours.</i>

42:35.346 --> 42:37.389
Well, who do we know
who has the minister's ear?

42:37.389 --> 42:40.100
Nobody who can trump
President Moreno,

42:40.100 --> 42:42.811
and he's very sensitive
to Durant's views on human rights.

42:42.811 --> 42:46.440
- Are you giving up on this?
-<i> No, just being realistic.</i>

42:46.440 --> 42:49.485
- Work on Moreno, then.
- We'll start leaving footprints.

42:49.485 --> 42:51.528
<i>- Quiet.</i>
- Excuse me?

42:51.528 --> 42:54.698
- Oh. Not you, my birds.
<i>- I think we need to be prepared</i>

42:54.698 --> 42:57.868
<i>for the possibility that we can't follow</i>
<i>through with our threat.</i>

42:57.868 --> 43:00.579
I am hearing excuses,
not solutions.

43:00.579 --> 43:04.833
My hands are tied. I can't circumvent
the entire US State Department.

43:04.833 --> 43:07.252
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I hired you to destroy Frank.</i>

43:07.252 --> 43:09.338
- You're failing.
<i>- Look, Raymond,</i>

43:09.338 --> 43:11.507
<i>I'm your lobbyist,</i>
<i>not your henchman.</i>

43:11.507 --> 43:12.883
I don't employ lobbyists.

43:12.883 --> 43:14.259
<i>I employ people</i>

43:14.259 --> 43:15.719
<i>who can be useful to me.</i>

43:15.719 --> 43:18.430
And you are proving otherwise.
Quiet now.

43:18.430 --> 43:20.974
- I'll figure something out.
-<i> Soon.</i>

43:34.988 --> 43:37.491
OK, that's good.

43:37.491 --> 43:40.160
You don't have to do this.

43:40.160 --> 43:42.412
Yeah, I do.

43:42.412 --> 43:44.748
The charges are dropped.

43:44.748 --> 43:46.708
They lied to you.
You can lie to them.

43:46.708 --> 43:50.712
New charges can always be filed.
It's not worth the risk.

43:51.922 --> 43:53.632
OK.

43:59.054 --> 44:01.640
Are you disappointed in me?

44:02.975 --> 44:04.852
Let's just get it over with.

44:12.734 --> 44:15.195
OK, go ahead.

44:15.195 --> 44:18.198
I'd like to make a statement.

44:18.198 --> 44:20.158
There will be a little cleanup,
some folks who will want

44:20.158 --> 44:23.287
to linger on the story, but we're
over the hump, I'd say.

44:23.287 --> 44:25.080
So we can leave the house now?

44:25.080 --> 44:27.416
The sooner you get back to
normal work, the better.

44:27.416 --> 44:29.626
All the meetings I had to cancel, let's
find a way to get them back on the books.

44:29.626 --> 44:32.546
- Yes, sir. - I need to push
ahead with the assault bill.

44:32.546 --> 44:34.673
We've got your Matt Bai
interview lined up for tomorrow,

44:34.673 --> 44:36.967
- but I think that--
- Maybe we should hold off on Bai

44:36.967 --> 44:40.804
- till after things quiet down.
- That's exactly what I was gonna suggest.

44:40.804 --> 44:44.433
- Doug is right.
- OK, let's get going.

44:44.433 --> 44:46.435
I'll meet you in the car.

44:48.270 --> 44:50.522
He's done a good job
handling all this.

44:50.522 --> 44:53.817
- Yes, he has.
- Should we have any more concerns?

44:53.817 --> 44:57.446
- He claims he doesn't have anything else.
- Do you believe him?

44:57.446 --> 44:59.615
I wouldn't go that far.

44:59.615 --> 45:02.284
- Keep an eye on him.
- I plan to.

45:02.284 --> 45:05.829
As for Raymond, we have to strike
back hard and fast.

45:05.829 --> 45:07.956
I want him obliterated.

45:07.956 --> 45:10.250
More than that.

45:11.126 --> 45:13.962
Let's make him suffer.

45:13.962 --> 45:18.508
I don't know whether
to be proud or terrified.

45:19.301 --> 45:21.470
Perhaps both.

45:48.914 --> 45:51.750
Wish I could do more.

45:53.543 --> 45:56.797
- What you gonna do with her?
- I don't know yet.

45:56.797 --> 46:01.468
Probably have to knock it down.
It's worth more as an empty lot.

46:01.468 --> 46:05.013
Is there anything else you wanna take?
A memento or something?

46:07.349 --> 46:09.309
Nah.

46:09.309 --> 46:11.937
I ain't one
for lookin' back.

46:11.937 --> 46:14.314
Eyes ahead.

46:15.524 --> 46:16.733
Good luck, Freddy.

46:38.171 --> 48:57.394
