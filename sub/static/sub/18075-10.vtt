00:01.000 --> 00:03.887
[Man]
Ten years ago, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court...

00:03.973 --> 00:05.880
for a crime they didn"t commit.

00:05.973 --> 00:10.546
These men promptly escaped
from a maximum-security stockade
to the Los Angeles underground.

00:10.639 --> 00:14.679
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:14.764 --> 00:18.508
If you have a problem, if no one else
can help, and if you can find them...

00:18.597 --> 00:21.228
maybe you can hire... the A-Team.

[Braying]

02:02.797 --> 02:04.917
[Horse Neighs]

02:15.046 --> 02:17.581
I don't like it, Dad.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.206
Neither do I, honey.

02:20.295 --> 02:23.459
But we gotta get this crop
to market...

02:23.545 --> 02:26.294
or we're gonna lose everything.

02:26.378 --> 02:31.082
I figure we got two or three more loads,
then we can clean out the warehouse.

02:31.170 --> 02:34.416
And if we move fast, we won't
lose too much to spoilage.

02:34.503 --> 02:38.745
I don't believe this is happening.
I don't believe Chuck Easterland
can just put us out of business.

02:38.836 --> 02:41.122
Sweetheart, it hasn't happened yet.

02:41.210 --> 02:43.165
Dad...

02:44.960 --> 02:48.906
he's threatened every truck driver
who's been willing to haul our produce.

02:49.001 --> 02:51.371
What's to stop him
from killing you?

02:51.460 --> 02:54.374
Honey, they whole Vietcong Army
couldn't kill me.

02:54.459 --> 02:57.623
I'm not about to let
Chuck Easterland do it.

02:57.709 --> 03:00.162
Now give me a kiss.
Come on.

03:08.667 --> 03:11.119
[Engine Starts]

03:11.208 --> 03:15.581
Stay inside like I told you, Ellen.
Don't go anywhere near Green Valley.

03:15.666 --> 03:18.580
I'll call you when I get to L.A.

03:34.706 --> 03:36.613
He's headin' out!

03:41.456 --> 03:43.778
Which way out of the valley, Whit?

03:43.872 --> 03:46.277
[Whit On Radio]
He"s takin" l-16 south.

03:46.372 --> 03:49.121
Okay. Well, you stay with him.

03:49.205 --> 03:53.364
- [Horse Neighs]
- Now, some of you boys
haven't worked for me very long.

03:53.455 --> 03:56.701
Do this one right,
and there'll be a big bonus.

04:09.620 --> 04:12.239
Comin' towards ya, Milt.

04:13.370 --> 04:15.988
We're all set.

04:35.035 --> 04:37.819
[Horn Honking]

05:01.033 --> 05:03.699
[Siren Wailing]

05:07.199 --> 05:10.529
Just what is your interest
in all this, uh, Miss Allen?

05:10.615 --> 05:12.522
My interest is as a reporter.

05:12.615 --> 05:15.364
The L.A. police already took his
statement and said that I could stay.

05:15.448 --> 05:18.115
I'm writing a story on Mr Penhall
and what's happening to him.

05:18.198 --> 05:20.105
You don't say.

05:20.198 --> 05:23.279
Sheriff Murphy is
Chuck Easterland"s brother-in-law.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.734
He"s not going to give us any help.

05:25.822 --> 05:28.939
Sure sorry you had to make the drive
all the way from Green Valley...

05:29.030 --> 05:31.234
just to keep up appearances, Dale.

05:31.322 --> 05:33.893
That's about all that kind of junk
I'm gonna listen to, Ellen.

05:33.988 --> 05:38.112
You're accusin' me of collusion
in this here crime, and I ain't gonna
stand for no more of it!

05:38.196 --> 05:41.277
- Lunch-time.
- Can't that wait?

05:41.363 --> 05:43.768
- Huh?
- I said, can't that wait?

05:43.863 --> 05:48.022
- ## [Headphones]
- Nope. No steak. Not today.

05:48.112 --> 05:51.276
I didn't say "steak."
I said "wait"!

05:51.362 --> 05:53.399
l"m tryin" to do
a police report here!

05:53.487 --> 05:58.309
No dribble straws left.
Gotta be careful with the juice.

05:58.403 --> 06:01.650
I got the physical description
as best as you can remember 'em.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.857
I'll get to workin' on it.

06:03.944 --> 06:05.899
Goodbye, Sheriff.

06:07.486 --> 06:10.602
- [Door Closes]
- Thank you for writing this story, Amy.

06:10.694 --> 06:12.898
I don't know if it's
going to do any good...

06:12.985 --> 06:15.141
but at least it will
make Easterland squirm.

06:15.235 --> 06:18.150
I guess your friends
decided not to help us.

06:18.235 --> 06:22.560
I don't know why. I really don't.
I thought one of them would come.

06:22.651 --> 06:24.725
Carrots look real runny today.

06:24.818 --> 06:28.598
You know, Easterland thinks that
if he can keep my produce from market...

06:28.692 --> 06:30.600
I'm gonna have to sell
the farm to the bank...

06:30.692 --> 06:35.065
and then all he has to do
is step right in and buy it up,
like he did all those others.

06:35.150 --> 06:38.646
He owns half the valley by now.
It's an impossible situation, Ellen.

06:38.733 --> 06:41.056
l... I feel like we're licked.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.638
My friends specialize
in impossible situations.

06:43.733 --> 06:46.980
I don't have any money.
It's all tied up with the bank.

06:47.066 --> 06:51.604
But if your friends can move my produce,
I'll see to it that they get 30% of the profit.

06:51.691 --> 06:54.475
I don't really think
that's going to be necessary.

06:54.565 --> 06:59.471
- [Dishes Clanging]
- Ain't allowed for people to be in here
when I feed this man.

06:59.565 --> 07:02.314
Bad for his digestion.
Hospital rule.

07:02.398 --> 07:04.969
- So if you'll just step outside...
- I don't really think that we're...

07:05.065 --> 07:07.304
Both of you, please.
Won't take a moment.

07:07.398 --> 07:09.305
Thank you.

07:18.314 --> 07:20.636
## [Radio Stops]

07:20.730 --> 07:24.142
- What was your unit in 'Nam?
- What?

07:24.230 --> 07:26.599
Well, underneath this
putty nose and make-up...

07:26.688 --> 07:30.551
is a remarkably handsome veteran
who was stationed for a while at Plei Ku.

07:30.646 --> 07:33.644
Lieutenant Colonel,
Fifth Special Forces Group.

07:33.729 --> 07:37.141
I know that unit.
Had a commanding officer...

07:37.229 --> 07:40.428
some lunatic by the name
of Hannibal something.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.641
- At your service.
- You're Amy's friend?

07:42.728 --> 07:45.761
[Laughs]
You guys are a bunch of criminals.

07:45.853 --> 07:48.472
I read all about you
when I was pullin' out of'Nam.

07:48.561 --> 07:52.306
- The world is full of ironic
complications, isn't it?
- You're gonna help me?

07:52.394 --> 07:54.965
Let's say maybe I'd be interested
in getting your watermelons to market.

07:55.061 --> 07:59.433
- Do you have any trucks?
- No. I hired a trucking company...
a Lone Horse Trucking.

07:59.519 --> 08:03.215
Its owner, Bill Mather,
accepted a $ 1,000 advance...

08:03.310 --> 08:06.308
to move my crop,
and he never showed up.

08:06.393 --> 08:08.300
Easterland paid him off.

08:08.393 --> 08:12.090
All the other guys that I hired
either got run off the road or got shot at.

08:12.184 --> 08:15.550
- And nobody's even gonna
drive in that valley now.
- I will.

08:15.642 --> 08:18.593
Now, 30% of the crop...
How much is that worth?

08:18.684 --> 08:22.428
Well, that all depends on what the market
value is and how ripe the melons are.

08:22.517 --> 08:24.637
- Well, how ripe are they?
- They"re too ripe.

08:24.725 --> 08:28.386
They gotta be there by Friday.
That's two days.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.631
- l"ll be in touch.
- Where are you gonna get your truck?

08:30.725 --> 08:33.294
You bought a ride
from Lone Horse Trucking...

08:33.390 --> 08:36.472
so we'll just count on Bill Mather
to supply any trucks we need.

08:36.557 --> 08:39.224
Easterland bought him off.
He double-crossed me.

08:39.307 --> 08:41.345
There's no way he's gonna help you.

08:41.432 --> 08:43.422
Sure, he will.

08:43.515 --> 08:46.596
He just hasn't been asked
the right way.

08:49.556 --> 08:53.632
- Oh, you never told me your unit.
- 101 st Airborne.

08:53.723 --> 08:55.630
You guys took it real bad up in Hue.

08:55.723 --> 08:57.962
At least there
I knew it was coming.

08:58.056 --> 09:02.594
This thing came right out of nowhere.
Colonel, I thank you for helping me.

09:02.680 --> 09:06.377
I haven't done anything... yet.

09:07.972 --> 09:10.804
## [Headphones]

09:10.888 --> 09:13.839
I don't know where he is.
He said he'd come.

09:13.929 --> 09:19.001
He did. Come on, kid.
We're in the watermelon business.

09:19.096 --> 09:21.714
Hannibal, you did it to me again.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.086
Come on, boy. Come on, Billy.
Come on, boy. Yeah, boy.

09:28.178 --> 09:32.219
Yeah, yeah, boy.
Hey, uh-uh-uh!

09:32.303 --> 09:34.673
He won't even stay
under my bed any more, Face.

09:34.761 --> 09:38.422
I put his bowl under there and everything.
I think the psychiatric ward
is makin' Billy nervous.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.750
He won"t eat regularly. He barks.

09:40.844 --> 09:43.167
[Howling]
In the middle of the night.

09:43.260 --> 09:45.298
Have you changed
his flea collar?

09:45.385 --> 09:48.466
When a dog gets fleas, it twists 'em,
Murdock, makes 'em crazy.

09:48.552 --> 09:51.300
Look, Face, this man don"t have a dog.

09:51.385 --> 09:54.548
So why are we sittin' around here
talkin' about a dog that don't exist?

09:54.635 --> 09:56.542
B.A., it isn't that Billy
doesn't exist.

09:56.634 --> 09:58.625
In a practical sense,
Billy does exist.

09:58.718 --> 10:01.466
He represents a, uh, love fixation...

10:01.551 --> 10:04.548
that bridges a relationship gap
Murdock had when he was a child.

10:04.634 --> 10:06.541
Absolutely, man.
Go on, Billy. Go on.

10:06.634 --> 10:10.627
This is my van, and I don't wanna hear
no more talk about Billy in my van.

10:10.717 --> 10:12.458
You got it?

10:12.550 --> 10:14.955
All right.
[Sighs]

10:15.050 --> 10:18.415
We're on a case.
We are hauling produce...

10:18.508 --> 10:21.459
for 30% of the market price.

10:21.549 --> 10:24.630
- B.A., you still got a line
on that "80 Buick sedan?
- Yeah.

10:24.716 --> 10:27.417
We'll have to dress that up.
Face, we need some truck scales.

10:27.507 --> 10:31.796
- What about me?
- You take Ellen on up to Penhall Farm
and wait for us.

10:31.882 --> 10:36.290
- Where is Billy?
I don't want to step on his tail.
- Shh. He's right there.

10:36.381 --> 10:39.296
Ain't no dog.

10:39.381 --> 10:42.793
All right.
Who wants to be a cop?

10:42.881 --> 10:44.955
Don't look at me.

10:45.047 --> 10:48.045
Oh, me. Me, me, me.
Oh, please, me.

10:51.297 --> 10:54.744
Okay, Face. It's you.

10:54.838 --> 10:58.334
Come on, Billy. Come on, boy.
Come on. Yeah, boy.

10:58.421 --> 11:01.289
What kind of produce
we haulin', Hannibal?

11:01.379 --> 11:04.377
- Watermelons.
- [Sighs]

11:32.377 --> 11:35.209
Murdock, why are you doing that?

11:35.293 --> 11:39.073
[Italian Accent]
I gotta paint it, I'm-a gonna sign it.

11:50.625 --> 11:53.789
You got the "out of service"
signs, B.A.?

11:53.875 --> 11:55.072
Yeah.

11:55.167 --> 11:57.951
He's throwin' our sweet rolls
on the floor, Hannibal.

11:58.042 --> 12:02.829
Well, he's just, uh,
feeding his dog Billy. Relax.

12:02.916 --> 12:05.037
Murdock throwin'
our food on the ground.

12:05.124 --> 12:08.537
Ain't no Billy! Man, how long
we gonna put up with this mess?

12:08.624 --> 12:12.072
The next stop's the Gear Jammer's Café
at the bottom of the Grapevine.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.073
Let's go.

12:15.790 --> 12:18.492
Come on, Billy. Come on.

12:37.538 --> 12:39.943
[Murdock]
Why we gotta be out of service?

12:40.038 --> 12:43.450
[Face]
Well, this is a pretty good mock-up
of a squad car, but it's not perfect.

12:43.538 --> 12:46.785
So we're transportation people
from Universal Studios...

12:46.871 --> 12:49.869
making a movie called
It Came From Planet X.

12:49.954 --> 12:53.948
That way, if we get pulled over
by a real Highway Patrol car,
we"re not gonna get busted.

12:54.037 --> 12:56.786
Good luck with that one, sucker.

12:56.870 --> 12:59.156
You're up, B.A.

13:18.827 --> 13:20.782
[Engine Starts]

13:53.032 --> 13:55.236
Okay, let's do it.

14:02.823 --> 14:04.778
[Siren Blares]

14:04.865 --> 14:07.567
Hey, Lone Horse,
you look a little heavy.

14:07.656 --> 14:11.566
When you find a good spot, pull over.
We're gonna have to weigh ya.

14:11.656 --> 14:13.563
[Siren Blares]

14:23.280 --> 14:26.692
- B.A., you reset those scales?
- Don't worry, man.

14:26.780 --> 14:29.315
This guy gonna weigh heavy,
no matter what he's carryin'.

14:29.405 --> 14:32.521
You just better hope no real cops
come along and see us doin' this.

14:39.029 --> 14:43.602
Come on. I'm okay. Haven't got
more than 80,000 pounds per axle.

14:43.695 --> 14:46.183
Is this rig over 60 feet?

14:46.278 --> 14:49.193
59', 11 ", man. I'm cool.

14:49.278 --> 14:51.731
What are ya haulin'?

14:51.819 --> 14:53.727
Paper rolls for roofing.

14:53.819 --> 14:57.599
Okay, let's measure the rig
and get it up on the scale!

14:57.694 --> 14:59.815
- Who's that?
- Mechanics from Barstow.

14:59.902 --> 15:02.604
They run the scales for us
and tow any rigs that are illegal.

15:02.694 --> 15:06.438
- You guys got nothin' better to do?
- Not this afternoon.

15:06.527 --> 15:09.015
Now, drive it up on the scale.
And go easy.

15:09.110 --> 15:11.942
You hit your brakes and bust my scale,
l"m gonna rain on you hard.

15:12.026 --> 15:14.775
Yeah, yeah.
I've heard all that before.

15:14.859 --> 15:17.348
You slimy smokies.

15:24.025 --> 15:26.395
[Engine Starts]

15:30.525 --> 15:33.274
Well, well, well.
Will wonders never cease?

15:33.358 --> 15:35.265
This guy's overloaded.

15:35.358 --> 15:40.264
106,000 pounds! Something's
wrong with your scale, bud.

15:40.357 --> 15:44.931
You're over gross 16,000 pounds.
You're gonna have to unload this truck.

15:45.024 --> 15:48.354
Aw, come on, you guys!
Are you kidding?

15:48.440 --> 15:52.350
Get the load out of the box, pal, or get
another truck out here and split the load.

15:52.440 --> 15:56.303
Either one. I don't care.
But you're not movin' till you're legal.

16:08.022 --> 16:11.020
Yeah. Let me speak
to Bill Mather.

16:24.646 --> 16:28.260
Hey, what's goin' on here, huh?
This truck's not overloaded.

16:28.354 --> 16:32.098
- I want your names
and your badge numbers.
- What's your name?

16:32.187 --> 16:34.888
I'm Bill Mather.
I own these rigs.

16:34.978 --> 16:38.094
What"s goin"on?
This driver isn"t over-grossed.

16:38.186 --> 16:40.093
- I know.
- Huh?

16:40.186 --> 16:44.096
- We're here to help you
with a problem of conscience.
- What are you talkin' about?

16:44.186 --> 16:47.800
Well, we don't want you
to lose any sleep...

16:47.894 --> 16:50.726
over taking Joe Penhall's money
and then double-crossing him.

16:50.810 --> 16:54.010
[Face] Yeah. That"s the kind of thing
that could give a man sleepless nights.

16:54.102 --> 16:57.016
Oh, not now, maybe.
Not this very moment.

16:57.101 --> 17:00.929
But, uh, some Christmas Eve,
you'll be sitting home alone...

17:01.018 --> 17:04.928
and you'll start wonderin'
how you could've sold out
a nice guy like Joe Penhall.

17:05.017 --> 17:09.425
Yeah. We've all seen it.
It's tragic.

17:09.517 --> 17:12.763
You're lucky we came along
in time to save you from it.

17:12.849 --> 17:16.595
- Who are you guys?
- We're the Ghosts of Christmas Future.

17:16.683 --> 17:19.597
We're also hijackers. So just
give us the keys and take a walk.

17:19.683 --> 17:23.262
We'll call you in a couple days
and tell you where to pick up your rigs.

17:23.348 --> 17:25.753
Do you know what Easterland's
gonna do to me? To you guys?

17:25.848 --> 17:28.930
You're in deep trouble
if you try to go through that valley.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.420
Now, that's the trouble
with taking a moral stand.

17:31.515 --> 17:34.927
Somebody's always angry.
But it makes you feel good, doesn't it?

17:35.015 --> 17:37.634
Oh, one other thing.
We're kind of crazy.

17:37.723 --> 17:42.427
So, uh, you report this to either
Easterland or the cops, we're gonna
come back and score some points on ya.

17:42.514 --> 17:46.460
- Yeah. I'm real scared.
- Huh? What'd he say?

17:48.931 --> 17:52.675
[Clears Throat]
Okay. Okay.

17:54.680 --> 17:58.756
[lmpersonating John Wayne]
All right. Head 'em up
and move 'em out.

17:58.846 --> 18:01.299
[Regular Voice]
Always wanted to say that line.

18:02.679 --> 18:04.635
Thanks.

18:14.928 --> 18:18.590
Well, we'll dump the uniforms
and the squad car.

18:18.678 --> 18:22.044
And that concludes phase one
of Operation Watermelon.

18:47.593 --> 18:51.337
Penhall Farms is just up 89 here,
about another 12 miles.

18:51.426 --> 18:54.127
You guys stay in line.

18:54.217 --> 18:57.464
Knockin' at your back door, brother.

18:57.550 --> 19:03.131
[Mimicking Track Announcer]
And they're in the stretch. Aladar
is along the rail and leads by a length.

19:03.216 --> 19:06.333
Two For The Road is holding on,
and Lady Luck is dropping off...

19:06.424 --> 19:08.379
as they come to the clubhouse turn...

19:08.466 --> 19:12.673
Why do you always do that
when my horse is in the lead?
I could've won the daily double.

19:12.757 --> 19:15.210
Hannibal, this fool
is startin' up again.

19:15.299 --> 19:18.462
I told you we should"ve left him
back there in the squad car trunk...

19:18.548 --> 19:20.456
with his stupid invisible dog.

19:20.548 --> 19:24.707
Talk softly. Billy
has finally gone to sleep.

19:28.756 --> 19:30.960
Looks like we"re gonna
have to run a roadblock.

19:33.089 --> 19:37.035
- B.A., stay in tight.
- I didn't know this was a toll road.

19:37.130 --> 19:38.789
It's not.

19:42.088 --> 19:45.252
[Horn Honking]

19:48.463 --> 19:49.790
Nice.

19:56.879 --> 19:59.581
Well, somebody's
gonna be mad at somebody.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.290
[Horse Neighs]

20:05.378 --> 20:08.660
Ellen, my friends are very good
at what they do.

20:08.753 --> 20:11.371
If Hannibal says
he can take care of Easterland...

20:11.461 --> 20:13.831
you can pretty much
count on that happening.

20:13.919 --> 20:18.825
Well, I hope you're right. Because if the
crop doesn't get to market, we're through.

20:18.919 --> 20:21.786
[Truck Horn Honking]

20:21.877 --> 20:23.832
Let's go.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.501
Miss Penhall? Hannibal Smith.

20:38.584 --> 20:40.823
These are Bill Mather's trucks.

20:40.917 --> 20:42.991
- You even got two of'em.
- He was running a sale.

20:43.083 --> 20:45.039
Steal one, get one free.

20:45.125 --> 20:49.747
We don't really need two. We've had some
spoilage. I think one would handle it.

20:49.833 --> 20:53.826
Okay, okay, okay!
[Sighs]

20:54.958 --> 20:58.536
Go on! Run along! Make sure
you stay outta the house.

20:58.624 --> 21:01.787
- Hope he doesn't mess
on the front porch there.
- [Sighs]

21:01.874 --> 21:04.788
Let's get goin'.
We got a lot of work to do.

21:12.165 --> 21:16.905
- Who are you?
- I'm B.A. Baracus, and
I'm here to pick up your crops.

21:16.997 --> 21:21.038
Oh, fine. Fine.
The barn's right up there.

21:28.830 --> 21:32.030
- Uh, do you have a phone I can use?
- There's one in the kitchen.

21:32.121 --> 21:35.700
Face, we've got a barn
full of watermelons we gotta load.

21:35.788 --> 21:40.160
Hannibal, I have to monitor the market,
try and get a report on watermelon sales.

21:40.246 --> 21:42.651
What's the matter? You don't
wanna get your hands dirty?

21:42.745 --> 21:45.696
Uh, you said the phone
was in the kitchen, right?

21:45.787 --> 21:47.861
Thanks. I'll be right back.

21:47.953 --> 21:51.532
That"s Chuck Easterland. How" d
he find out about you guys so soon?

21:51.620 --> 21:55.779
It could have something to do with
Hannibal blowing a roadblock a ways back.

21:55.869 --> 22:00.028
I wanted to draw him out. I always like
to see the size of the slug I'm after...

22:00.119 --> 22:02.074
before I step on him.

22:03.452 --> 22:07.031
Murdock, B.A., take the right.
Face, stay with me.

22:07.119 --> 22:11.657
- Uh, Hannibal, if we're gonna fight,
I prefer to be teamed with B.A.
- Me too.

22:11.743 --> 22:14.527
Are you guys sayin' you don't
wanna team up with me?

22:14.618 --> 22:16.692
- Yes.
- Yes.

22:16.784 --> 22:18.692
Why?

22:18.784 --> 22:22.825
I'll tell you why.
Because when you're on the jazz, man...

22:22.909 --> 22:24.983
you are dangerous!

23:01.156 --> 23:04.356
I want you and your men out of here.
This is private property.

23:04.447 --> 23:07.018
- You're all trespassing.
- [Chuckles]

23:07.114 --> 23:10.526
Why don't you call the sheriff
and sic the law on us?

23:10.614 --> 23:12.569
And how would you like
some good advice?

23:12.655 --> 23:15.688
I love advice.
Especially good advice.

23:15.780 --> 23:20.104
Uh, excuse me, but would you
mind terribly taking your foot
down off the bumper there?

23:20.196 --> 23:23.893
- Uh, no offence, but it's so rude.
- I'm a rude guy.

23:23.987 --> 23:26.902
Oh. Well, in that case,
go right ahead.

23:26.987 --> 23:29.855
- Here's your advice...
- Excuse me. My dog moved.

23:29.945 --> 23:33.026
Billy, get over here!
Get over here!

23:33.112 --> 23:36.643
Now, if you're not gonna be good,
you're stayin' on your leash.

23:36.736 --> 23:39.569
- He doesn't bite.
- [Chuckles]

23:39.653 --> 23:42.485
You guys are a bunch of clowns.
Very funny.

23:42.569 --> 23:45.236
- I'm bustin' a gut here.
- He's a mental patient.

23:45.319 --> 23:48.850
He"s not dangerous, usually,
but he does hallucinate.

23:48.944 --> 23:51.349
Now, you were giving me
some advice.

23:51.444 --> 23:56.350
Yeah. Here's your advice: Get back
in those trucks and roll 'em out of here.

23:56.443 --> 23:58.647
- That's it?
- That's it.

24:00.943 --> 24:03.894
I don't like that advice.
Have you got any other advice?

24:06.276 --> 24:08.764
I got a promise for ya.

24:08.859 --> 24:11.940
If you're not out of here
in a half an hour...

24:12.025 --> 24:15.640
I'm gonna wreck your trucks,
and I'm gonna wreck all your guys.

24:15.733 --> 24:18.518
Billy, stay put! Don't move.

24:18.608 --> 24:21.974
Now, what if I was very nice
and said...

24:22.066 --> 24:25.811
"Please, just let us do ourjob
and don"t hurt us"?

24:25.899 --> 24:27.854
Would that make any difference?

24:27.941 --> 24:31.223
That wouldn't make
any difference at all.

24:31.316 --> 24:35.854
Then it really doesn't matter
whether I stay on your good side or not.

24:35.940 --> 24:38.014
Not in the least.

24:38.107 --> 24:41.223
[Chuckles]
In that case...

24:45.148 --> 24:47.185
Watch out for my car!

24:47.273 --> 24:51.597
[Grunts, Whimpers]

24:54.980 --> 24:57.682
[Grunting]

24:57.772 --> 25:00.177
- Uh, B.A.!
- [Groans]

25:00.272 --> 25:01.930
Thanks.

25:29.978 --> 25:31.885
Is he all right?

25:31.977 --> 25:35.592
Likes to see how big the slug is before
he steps on him is what he likes to do.

25:35.685 --> 25:37.889
- [Mumbling]
- What'd he say?

25:37.977 --> 25:40.726
He said, "I love it
when a plan comes together."

26:20.557 --> 26:22.678
What do you think, B.A.?

26:22.765 --> 26:26.213
Oh, man, this rig is
about 16,000 overweight.

26:26.306 --> 26:29.008
And the rear brakes
is whistlin' "Dixie."

26:29.098 --> 26:32.345
And these air hoses...
They got dry rot.

26:32.431 --> 26:36.969
Wonderful. All they have to do is get
to Farmers Market in L.A.

26:40.555 --> 26:44.170
Hi. Just checking with
the produce exchange in L.A.

26:44.263 --> 26:46.171
I'm on hold.

26:52.263 --> 26:55.462
Amy says you're all wanted
by the military.

26:55.554 --> 26:58.505
And you hire out
to help people, right?

26:58.596 --> 27:02.292
Uh, yeah. That's pretty much it, Ellen.
It's a long, very sad story...

27:02.387 --> 27:04.840
a story of injustice.

27:04.928 --> 27:07.499
I don't want to bore you
with our problems.

27:07.595 --> 27:10.960
Uh, yeah. I wanted to check
what the, uh...

27:11.053 --> 27:13.174
[Chuckles]
Yeah, I'll hold.

27:13.261 --> 27:15.796
Never owned 30%
of a watermelon crop before.

27:15.886 --> 27:19.133
You know, if you can
get Dad's crop to market...

27:19.219 --> 27:21.340
you'll save the farm for us.

27:21.427 --> 27:23.998
I don't know how I'll ever
be able to thank you.

27:24.094 --> 27:27.008
You don't?

27:27.093 --> 27:30.921
Uh, hi. This is Penhall Farms.
We're checking the price of...

27:31.010 --> 27:33.842
Yeah, I'll hold.
They sound very busy.

27:33.926 --> 27:36.379
Price is probably going
right through the roof.

27:36.468 --> 27:39.169
Uh, yeah. Yeah. What's the price
per bushel of watermelon?

27:39.259 --> 27:42.210
Beautiful, rich,
succulent watermelon.

27:42.300 --> 27:44.967
- Green or white what?
- Rind. They're green.

27:45.050 --> 27:48.001
Green.
When were they harvested?

27:48.092 --> 27:51.504
- Last week. But don't tell them that.
- Yesterday.

27:51.591 --> 27:54.162
We got 100,000 pounds.

27:54.258 --> 27:57.872
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Bye.

27:57.966 --> 28:02.338
He says that if they're not too ripe,
he'll give us 40 bucks a bushel.

28:02.424 --> 28:04.498
That"s bad.
It"s off 50 cents a bushel.

28:04.590 --> 28:08.370
- But some of them are already going bad.
- Bad? Didn't you take care of them?

28:08.465 --> 28:11.498
They've been sitting in the barn
for a week and a half.

28:11.590 --> 28:15.002
Well, then we gotta get 'em to market.
I want to get at least 40 bucks a crate.

28:15.090 --> 28:18.040
I think I have a real feel
for this business. Don't you?

28:18.131 --> 28:22.041
No. But I like you guys anyway.

28:35.546 --> 28:37.453
- What's it like out there?
- Lousy.

28:37.546 --> 28:42.333
Easterland and his men have their pickups
barricaded across l-16 north,
with about 15 guys with weapons.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.991
It's the same action in the south.
We're penned in, Hannibal.

28:45.087 --> 28:47.836
Watermelons just dropped off
another 50 cents a bushel.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.875
Business is a little
tougher than I thought.

28:49.962 --> 28:52.285
Pretty soon we"ll have to pay someone
to take "em off our hands.

28:52.378 --> 28:55.162
Yeah, man. But first
we gotta get 'em to the market.

28:55.253 --> 28:58.665
- [Hannibal]
Now, we"ve all seen this before.
- We have?

28:58.753 --> 29:00.909
Of course.
It's your classic western.

29:01.003 --> 29:05.375
We're the cowboys in the box canyon.
Easterland and his Indians
have got us trapped.

29:05.461 --> 29:09.039
Oh, maybe we could trade our way
out of this with beaver pelts.

29:09.127 --> 29:11.793
B.A., do you think you could put
a cowcatcher on the front of this truck?

29:11.877 --> 29:14.033
- Oh, Hannibal...
- Good.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.615
Now, we need a chase car.

29:16.710 --> 29:21.331
Something fast, light. Something
we can plate for protection.

29:21.418 --> 29:23.491
Hannibal, where
are we gonna find that?

29:23.584 --> 29:25.622
[Clears Throat]

29:31.584 --> 29:35.529
Of course you're kidding. Not my new car.
Come on. It's not even paid for yet.

29:35.625 --> 29:38.990
Kid, the way I'm doin' with
watermelon futures, you're gonna
want to get rid of that thing.

29:39.083 --> 29:41.701
Get yourself a Mercedes...
or a Cadillac, anyway.

29:41.791 --> 29:46.495
You guys think you're gonna hang
armour plating all over my new car?

29:46.582 --> 29:48.040
You're nuts.

29:48.124 --> 29:51.287
You got us into this, Amy.
We gotta use what's available.

29:51.374 --> 29:53.364
Don't worry, lady.
I'll be real careful.

29:53.457 --> 29:55.945
Put three holes in the front...

29:56.040 --> 29:59.820
cut here and there,
won't even change a thing.

29:59.915 --> 30:02.617
I'll have it back to you
just like new.

30:02.706 --> 30:04.613
But it's my new car.

30:04.706 --> 30:09.327
We're cut off.
They've got a tractor across the road.

30:09.414 --> 30:12.826
Forty guys with guns, and you're
worrying about your little car?

30:12.914 --> 30:16.326
Amy, Amy, Amy!
I'm ashamed of you.

30:16.413 --> 30:21.615
Boy, you could con anybody
out of anything, couldn't you?

30:21.705 --> 30:24.786
Okay. Go ahead.

30:24.871 --> 30:28.995
Right. I wanna be out of here
in two hours. Let's get going.

30:31.537 --> 30:36.241
Put those trucks together.
I don't want any gaps, just in case
they try to squeeze through.

30:36.328 --> 30:38.698
Mr Easterland,
Sheriff Murphy called.

30:38.787 --> 30:42.650
He's real nervous 'cause
the Highway Department's all over him
about this detour request.

30:42.745 --> 30:44.652
[Laughs]
That's too bad.

30:44.744 --> 30:47.233
That's what he's gettin' paid for...
to keep the heat off.

30:47.328 --> 30:49.994
Those guys aren't gettin'
through this valley.

32:07.946 --> 32:09.853
How's the market, Face?

32:09.946 --> 32:13.394
- Frisco bid in at 43 cents more
a bushel than L.A.
- Great.

32:13.487 --> 32:17.184
- Where's my car?
- Isn't it beautiful?

32:17.279 --> 32:22.694
Lady, a couple of bolts, fresh paint,
it'll be good as new.

32:22.778 --> 32:26.440
How do I get into these things?

32:26.528 --> 32:28.400
Let's mount up!

32:33.944 --> 32:36.611
[Engine Starts]

32:36.694 --> 32:38.601
Here goes nothing.

32:49.735 --> 32:53.266
- Do you think they'll get through?
- Probably not.

32:53.359 --> 32:57.056
- Then Easterland will kill them.
- And that probably won't happen either.

33:26.565 --> 33:29.314
Here they come.

33:29.398 --> 33:32.230
What"s that
on the front of the truck?

33:37.148 --> 33:40.560
Milt, they're comin' south,
and they mean business.

33:40.647 --> 33:42.803
You boys get down here
and give us a hand.

33:42.897 --> 33:45.468
They're makin' their way south.
Let's go.

34:02.021 --> 34:05.351
Okay, Face,
I'm gonna thread this sucker...

34:05.437 --> 34:07.511
through the eye of the needle.

34:24.060 --> 34:25.967
Oh, no.

34:26.060 --> 34:29.177
They sure don't look like Indians
to me, Face. I think we misjudged 'em.

34:44.391 --> 34:47.509
Come on! Get in the truck!
Let's get after them!

35:23.889 --> 35:26.424
Whitaker, they got through us.

35:26.514 --> 35:28.635
Go with the backup plan.

35:34.763 --> 35:37.963
- [Coughing] Murdock, can you see?
- I can't even see your teeth!

35:49.220 --> 35:50.761
Look out!

35:59.095 --> 36:01.464
Howdy, neighbour.
How's everything?

36:01.553 --> 36:03.757
Get out! Now!

36:15.260 --> 36:17.215
[Chuckles]
Hi.

36:27.717 --> 36:31.793
I told you to get outta here.
Maybe next time you'll listen.

36:31.884 --> 36:35.498
I doubt it. I'm stubborn.
It's a serious character flaw.

36:37.508 --> 36:39.795
How about Billy?
Don't forget my dog, Billy!

36:39.883 --> 36:43.793
Yes. At least let him take his pet dog.
I mean, fair is fair.

36:43.883 --> 36:46.880
Thanks, Colonel. Hey, Billy! Here!

36:46.966 --> 36:51.255
You think that"s funny? We"ll see how
hard you laugh when we burn your crop.

36:51.341 --> 36:54.291
All right, boys. Open up the tail
and torch that load.

36:54.382 --> 36:56.752
[Grunts]

37:03.381 --> 37:06.130
Like the man said,
the watermelon market's real soft.

37:06.214 --> 37:09.627
All right, wise guys. Where's
the rest of those watermelons?

37:09.714 --> 37:11.954
Beats the heck outta me.

37:12.047 --> 37:15.495
You know, I thought they were
with Murdock's dog, Billy.

37:16.672 --> 37:19.290
They're headin' south.
I pulled that roadblock.

37:19.380 --> 37:21.584
They got about a 15-minute
head start on us.

37:21.672 --> 37:24.954
You take these guys over
to my place and get the chopper.

37:25.046 --> 37:28.956
The rest of you guys, come with me.
And call Bill Mather.
Tell him to pick up his rig.

37:29.046 --> 37:31.534
That truck's not gettin'
through this valley.

37:39.837 --> 37:41.744
See ya, guys.

38:00.085 --> 38:01.910
[Horse Neighs]

38:23.333 --> 38:25.407
Outta here. Move it.

38:35.291 --> 38:38.573
Go tell Lenny to fire up the chopper.
I'll be there in a minute.

38:38.665 --> 38:40.988
Don't even think it, mister.

38:41.082 --> 38:43.866
Just... takin' out a cigar.

38:43.957 --> 38:46.741
- No, you ain't.
- [Face] Oh, no.

38:46.831 --> 38:51.951
Murdock, please...
don't look at the horses.

38:52.039 --> 38:56.743
Horses. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no!
[Whinnying]

38:56.831 --> 39:02.164
No! I used to have horses
on my walls...

39:02.247 --> 39:07.911
horses in my bedspread,
horses in my closets!

39:07.996 --> 39:10.781
Horses... Horses everywhere!

39:10.871 --> 39:14.319
[Neighs, Whinnies]

39:14.413 --> 39:18.737
- What are you, nuts?
- Sure is. Certified by the state
and everything.

39:18.829 --> 39:21.447
- Shut him up, man.
- [Neighs]

39:21.537 --> 39:26.443
Whoa! Whoa, big fella.
Whoa! Easy! Easy, big fella!

39:26.537 --> 39:30.577
Whoa! Whoa. Here. Here. Here.

39:30.661 --> 39:35.235
[Laughs]
Easy. Easy, big fella.

39:35.328 --> 39:39.451
- [Neighing Continues]
- Whoa! Whoa! Easy.

39:39.536 --> 39:42.699
Easy, big fella! Whoa! Whoa!

39:47.160 --> 39:49.399
- [Horses Neighing]
- Jake, get the extinguishers!

39:49.493 --> 39:51.816
Mark, get those horses outta there!

39:57.076 --> 40:00.074
Hey, fella! The whole barn went!
Some sort of gas main!

40:00.159 --> 40:03.073
They got guys crawlin' around
lookin' for their heads! Terrible!

40:03.159 --> 40:05.315
You better get down there!

40:14.908 --> 40:18.604
- You gotta be kiddin'!
- We've gotta have some firepower.

40:31.157 --> 40:33.989
Get on the horn.
Let Mr Easterland know.

40:43.989 --> 40:46.394
How do you think
the others are doing?

40:49.155 --> 40:52.437
Probably not too good.
There was Easterland men back there.

40:52.530 --> 40:54.437
This whole plan sounded
ridiculous from the start.

40:54.530 --> 40:56.437
I should've known
it wouldn't work out right.

40:56.530 --> 41:00.061
Hannibal's plans never work right.
They just work.

41:25.152 --> 41:27.439
- They're alongside, B.A.
- I know.

42:40.855 --> 42:43.425
Oh, boy! Is somebody
in for a surprise!

43:05.936 --> 43:09.266
One of us has got to do it.

43:12.311 --> 43:14.266
Take her down, Murdock!

43:19.435 --> 43:21.674
This is Lady Crazy Pilot
to Lady Crazy Bombardier.

43:21.768 --> 43:25.098
We're over the target,
and I'm turnin' the craft over to you.
Commence bomb run.

43:34.101 --> 43:39.255
Aw, Face!
You lack experience. Watch.

43:39.350 --> 43:42.264
Let's get outta here.

43:53.099 --> 43:55.173
Nice drop, Kemosabe.

43:55.266 --> 43:58.347
He wanted watermelons.
I just gave him a couple.

44:30.013 --> 44:32.466
What happened to my car, Hannibal?

44:32.554 --> 44:34.959
I told you. B.A. and Murdock
are bringing it.

44:35.054 --> 44:37.922
We had to leave it at Easterland's.
We took the chopper.

44:38.012 --> 44:40.133
There's something
you're not telling me.

44:40.220 --> 44:42.969
- Somehow you hurt my car.
- Hurt your car?

44:43.053 --> 44:46.584
You're really hurting me
by saying that, guys. You...

44:46.678 --> 44:49.213
You think I got a bad deal.

44:49.303 --> 44:51.340
I'm the one
who got the bad deal!

44:51.428 --> 44:53.998
It's not that I don't appreciate
what you done and all.

44:54.094 --> 44:56.878
If you hadn't driven our crop to market,
we would've lost everything.

44:56.969 --> 45:00.666
But $33.60 a bushel is a lot less
than we said at the Frisco market.

45:00.760 --> 45:04.457
Well, maybe I'd have got that
if you'd have taken better care of'em.

45:04.552 --> 45:07.087
I mean, who wants to eat watermelon
that are too ripe?

45:07.177 --> 45:09.214
- Not me. I can tell you that.
- Face.

45:09.301 --> 45:13.875
Uh, yeah, okay. Okay. I said
we'd reduce our cut to 20%.

45:13.968 --> 45:17.084
That should make the difference.

45:17.176 --> 45:19.878
I was just trying to boost
profits for everybody.

45:19.967 --> 45:21.874
Hannibal, my car!

45:24.383 --> 45:27.251
I want my car!
That's all I care about!

45:27.342 --> 45:29.297
- I want my car!
- It's on its way.

45:29.383 --> 45:31.374
I feel like
I'm waiting for a baby.

45:31.466 --> 45:34.037
Well, here comes
the little darling now.

45:45.798 --> 45:48.962
With the excitement
and the escape...

45:49.048 --> 45:51.122
I don't remember it
looking like that.

45:53.465 --> 45:56.960
A couple of bolts
and some new paint?

45:57.048 --> 45:59.085
Look, lady, I was
with you, remember?

45:59.172 --> 46:02.787
You talked me into this, Face.

46:02.880 --> 46:08.213
Whatever it takes to put my cute,
little, new Le Car back into shape...

46:08.297 --> 46:10.370
is comin' outta your end.

46:10.463 --> 46:12.749
- Wait. My end?
- Mm-hmm.

46:12.838 --> 46:16.038
Oh, uh, my end's
already down 10 percent.

46:16.129 --> 46:19.542
Don"t feel bad, Amy.
Billy and I will chip in too.

46:19.629 --> 46:23.623
Won't you, boy?
Good doggie! Good doggie!
