   and all the ships at sea.

02:49.303 --> 02:52.204
   Music flash. Is The Voice
      now just the gargle?

02:52.206 --> 02:56.208
Whether temporary or otherwise,
    the old black magic that
   once made thousands swoon

02:56.210 --> 02:59.912
      when Mr. S wrenched
"Night and Day" from his sapling
 frame is gone from the throat.

  The bobby-soxers are no longer
    hypnotized by the vocals,
  no longer swayed by the music.

       goodness, no longer.

03:07.321 --> 03:11.290
       Crooner boy Frank
     Sinatra's charm seems
    to have gone a fleeting.

03:11.292 --> 03:16.762
   Maybe the bobby-soxers are
 getting more absorbed in such
 little matters as the H-bomb.

  Como and Eddie Fisher climbing
     the charts making waves,

       yesterday's news.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.572
   Nothing personal, Frankie.

03:26.574 --> 03:32.611

      they say: Hot today,
   cold as a corpse tomorrow.

  Mr. Selznick has personally
 selected you, Señorita Valley.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.896
    Oh, yes, I'm going to do
  a movie with Mr. Hitchcock.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.967
   Look at Selznick with the
      flavor of the month.

03:54.969 --> 03:56.568
           Goodness.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.304
  She's practically flaunting
  those diamonds, isn't she?

03:59.306 --> 04:02.474
      Oh, we've been hearing
      quite a bit about you,
       Marilyn, these days,

04:02.476 --> 04:05.244
 especially your jewelry, dear.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.913
        Isn't it dreamy?

04:08.983 --> 04:11.883
          David Selznick
      spent a lot of flavors
       of the month though:

04:11.885 --> 04:14.553
       Lena Horne, Grace
      Kelly, Lana Turner.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.654
  -Where are you from, honey?
         -Philadelphia.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.757
 And despite of what Mr. Field
 says, it's a very nice place.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.928
Poor Nancy, it's so humiliating.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.032
 You covered it so thoroughly.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.667
       As did you, Lila.

04:28.669 --> 04:32.271
       Speaking of which,
where's the star of hit parade?

04:32.273 --> 04:34.006
 I'm sure he's here somewhere.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.907
 I saw his goons lurking about.

04:43.584 --> 04:48.320
 Surprised he shows his face at
 all after reading your column.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.022

        the facts, dearie.

05:04.371 --> 05:07.572

         pounds has-been?

05:08.676 --> 05:11.677

 Oh, it doesn't matter as long
as it's nineteen pounds of cock.

05:28.996 --> 05:32.097
         Let me guess.
    Washing his hands again?

05:32.099 --> 05:35.434
         Oh, he's worried
    about his throat, so he's
    washing all the germs off.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.003
    The germs or the guilt?

05:38.005 --> 05:40.673
     They busted him again.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.342
       This-- this whole
       Maxwell business,
 press got him cold this time.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.643
  Mortimer, Winchell, The Hat.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.078
       They got nothing.

05:46.080 --> 05:50.065
     That's why we're here.

05:50.066 --> 05:54.051
     I can't do this anymore.
  I have talked to him about the
   broads and money and Nancy.

05:54.054 --> 05:57.322
  The public knows. They know.

05:57.323 --> 06:00.591
   They don't like him anymore.
   You know what they call his
    show? Saturday Nightmares.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.494
       Come on, why are you
        reading that crap?

06:02.496 --> 06:05.797

    through in a year. He'll
    be dead professionally.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.867
     They're not gonna see
   his pictures. They are not
   gonna can buy his records.

       about Frank Sinatra.

  Where is he? Where's Frank?

06:18.112 --> 06:21.813
       Well, I do not know.
    I am not his keeper, am I?

06:21.815 --> 06:25.484
 Well, he needs to speak to me
about something very important.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.810
       He needs my help.

06:28.811 --> 06:32.135
      Because you've done
        so much already.

06:32.136 --> 06:35.460
 What Jack is trying to say is
  you had-- have always given
   Frank a fair shake. Right?

06:36.563 --> 06:37.996
 I think he's out by the pool.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.801

       might ruin that hat.

      gonna keep us here?

    Jack Keller to drive out
     here from Los Angeles.

12:58.245 --> 13:00.378

            Dreamy.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.368
       Silly, silly girl.

23:24.369 --> 23:26.803
   Feelings that have stayed
  with me until this very day.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.807
          Well, you have
        found the mystery.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.543
    You found your shepherd.

23:33.479 --> 23:35.045
  I'll always watch over you.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.448
     I'll always love you.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.050
      I don't believe you.

23:42.455 --> 23:48.826
        <i> ¶ Baby won't you</i>
       <i> Please come home ¶</i>

23:50.730 --> 23:53.631
  <i> ¶ 'Cause your daddy is-- ¶</i>

23:53.633 --> 23:54.999
  How do I know you're alone?

23:56.669 --> 23:58.836
       Well, prove to me
       that you're alone.

23:58.838 --> 24:02.740
What do you mean you can't find
   her? You can find anybody.

24:02.742 --> 24:06.444
     [Nancy] Frankie. Come
     with the kids to bed.

24:06.446 --> 24:07.945
         What the fuck
      am I paying you for?

24:08.981 --> 24:10.881
     Well, get over there and
       find out, goddammit.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.750
        Never mind that.
      Let me talk to you.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.486
             Hello.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.822
    Well, find her, for crying
        out loud, alright?

24:36.142 --> 24:39.743
      I was lousy tonight,
    wasn't I, huh? My voice
  was tight, it was cracking.

24:41.547 --> 24:46.484
    Jesus, don't be so hard
  on yourself. You can't bat a
 thousand when you're a singer.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.219
    Yeah, but you can't strike
      out every time either.

24:48.221 --> 24:52.756
      You didn't strike out,
      champ, you just didn't
    hit a homerun, that's all.

24:52.758 --> 24:55.192
       Let's face it. After
     fifteen years it's over.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.127
        I lost my voice,
      I lost my audience.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.232
    I'm even losing my hair.

25:02.568 --> 25:05.035
       Yeah, well, that's
       what hats are for.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.238
      Now listen, Cookie,
        we have to talk.

25:08.241 --> 25:11.242
        The record company
       decided not to renew
          your contract.

25:11.244 --> 25:15.179
        They decided to go
      with these young guys
   Perry Como and Eddie Fisher.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.681
   See, what did I tell you?
      You see the charts?

25:17.683 --> 25:19.149
  I'm yesterday's news, Jack.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.931
Okay, Frank, let's take a look.

25:36.269 --> 25:37.801
          Vocal cords

25:38.838 --> 25:41.839
        may be strained,
 possibly a little hemorrhage.

25:42.975 --> 25:45.042
        -Is it serious?
          -Like fail?

25:46.145 --> 25:49.179
       No, Frank, but it
      explains the voice.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.180
           What now?

25:51.684 --> 25:53.984
     Two weeks no talking.

25:53.986 --> 25:56.554
      No talking? What--
      what about singing?

25:56.556 --> 25:59.857
   No singing, no screaming,
          no shouting.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.892
        -What can I do?
           -Whisper.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.728
     When can I sing again?

26:04.730 --> 26:06.864
      Weeks, maybe months.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.967
    These things take time,
    Frank, you know. Perhaps

26:11.904 --> 26:14.338
       switch to Camels.
    It's like Joe DiMaggio.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.791
     Right now you're down.

26:35.628 --> 26:38.028
 They say you lost your voice.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.797
They're kicking you to the curb.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.201
    Along comes this broad,
    she makes you feel good.

26:44.203 --> 26:47.004
         Before I know,
  she floats you a few books.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.211
        When I see you,
  I see an old friend of mine.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.647
     Benny was a good man.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.149
      We grew up together.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.252
        He was handsome.

27:02.254 --> 27:03.354
         He was tough.

27:03.356 --> 27:08.258
 He was great with the ladies.
      He was a visionary.

27:08.260 --> 27:11.195
 But along came this one broad,

27:11.197 --> 27:14.632
        nothing special,
   everyone's been with her.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.266
       She couldn't keep
       her legs crossed.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.970
   But he went nuts for her.

27:19.972 --> 27:24.942
 He leaves his wife, his kids,
  he moves out to California.

27:24.944 --> 27:27.177
  He thinks he's a movie star.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.912
     Before long he's lost

27:29.882 --> 27:32.282
 and then everything went bad.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.351
The Flamingo couldn't save him.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.421
     Nobody could save him.

27:42.028 --> 27:44.161
       Watch out for this
       movie star, Frank.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.664
        Don't get lost.

27:48.100 --> 27:52.436
[Ava] Could we for once not talk
      about Howard Hughes?

27:52.438 --> 27:54.972
         [Frank] Why not?
    You spread it, didn't you?

27:57.677 --> 28:00.010
        Did you hear that?
  They're gonna kill each other.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.745
  Just mind your own business.

28:01.747 --> 28:03.414
      You son of a bitch.

28:03.416 --> 28:06.116
You call that pitching? I guess
 the Dodgers won't be calling.

28:06.118 --> 28:08.919
         God damn you.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.721
     I don't know how many
  times I've told you I never
       had sex with him.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.258
      He bought you jewelry,
  took on his fucking airplanes.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.261
        Just because he
    bought me some trinkets
   doesn't mean I fucked him.

28:17.263 --> 28:21.065
    That's right. I forgot.
     You like band leaders
  and bullfighters, don't you?

28:21.067 --> 28:24.968
    Did mama's little choirboy
       think I was a virgin
      when he came calling?

28:24.970 --> 28:27.971
     No, but I think maybe
  there was someone out there
       you hadn't fucked.

28:27.973 --> 28:29.339
         Miserable wop.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.177
            [thumps]

28:34.480 --> 28:37.281
       That clinches it.
      I'm going upstairs.

28:37.283 --> 28:43.287
  You do nothing of the kind.
    Just sit there and hush.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.823
        You can't even ask
     your wife for a divorce.

28:45.825 --> 28:48.358
       How am I supposed
     to ask her, huh? She's
  more Catholic than the Pope.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.228
     Then why don't you get
  one of your boys to go over
    there and convince her?

28:51.230 --> 28:53.564
  You stop talking like that.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.899
   What's the matter? I thought
  you were a big tough gangster.

28:55.901 --> 28:56.800
             Yeah?

29:07.813 --> 29:11.381
       For crying out loud,
     I can't believe how they
     can carry on like that.

29:11.383 --> 29:14.918
         I can. You've
      just forgotten how.

29:16.522 --> 29:19.189
      Alright, Frank, you be
         a good boy, huh?

29:19.191 --> 29:22.359
     Kiss your mommy. Daddy
   will be home later. Okay.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.265
     I got kids, remember?

29:29.435 --> 29:31.835
 Wife and family first, right?

29:33.038 --> 29:35.906
  Is this why we sneak around
       in strange houses?

29:40.446 --> 29:43.013
 I'm in love with you, Francis.

29:43.849 --> 29:47.017
        If I'm in love,
     I want to get married.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.255
           Otherwise

29:52.892 --> 29:54.224
       go back to Nancy.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.261
   You always go back anyway.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.864
    I don't want to go back.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.101
       I love you, baby.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.504
        I mean sometimes
 you scare the shit out of me.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.274
       I don't know what
     I'm doing with you but

30:11.343 --> 30:13.177
       I know I can't go
          without you.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.348
       Actions, Francis.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.384
            Actions.

30:20.386 --> 30:21.585
   [Frank] Where did you go?

30:22.555 --> 30:25.222
          Spain? What
    are you doing in Spain?

30:26.058 --> 30:27.090
             Hello?

30:28.427 --> 30:29.459
             Hello?

30:31.163 --> 30:33.230
       [Mario in Spanish]

30:41.307 --> 30:42.940
             Hank,

30:42.942 --> 30:44.608
        where the fuck
        is Mario Cabré?

30:45.578 --> 30:47.845
       [Mario in Spanish]

30:52.952 --> 30:55.452
          Mario Cabré is
      a fucking bullfighter,
      he is writing a poem.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.221
      Frankie, your voice.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.089
   Fucking guy is-- [coughs]

31:01.861 --> 31:03.260
      I'll call you back.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.963
          [in Spanish]

31:15.274 --> 31:17.174
 [barber] Looking good, Mr. S.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.475
   If you're going for Zorro.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.446
     -Looks authentic, right?
              -Yeah.

31:22.448 --> 31:25.282
     If I didn't even know
     you any better, you'd
     look like one of us.

31:25.284 --> 31:26.383
             <i> Olé!</i>

31:27.419 --> 31:28.385
           Any luck?

31:28.387 --> 31:29.620
She's not picking up the phone.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.257
 But when she sees that stash--

31:33.259 --> 31:36.426
        Never mind that.
     Go, go, cut the call.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.678
            C-note?

31:37.679 --> 31:38.929
       That's the biggest
       tip you ever got?

31:38.931 --> 31:39.897
      Got fifty last week.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.465
             Fifty?

31:41.467 --> 31:43.567
    What a lousy cheapskate
         gave you that?

31:43.569 --> 31:44.902
    That was you, Mister S.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.043
       Excuse me, aren't
       you Frank Sinatra?

31:53.045 --> 31:55.980
     Depends. Who's asking?

31:55.981 --> 31:58.916
 Former president, three years
running of the local chapter of
 the Sighting Society Swooners.

31:58.918 --> 32:01.018
    Kid wants an autograph.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.019
             Great.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.086
       Here you go, kid.

32:09.662 --> 32:11.528
    Thanks. Thanks a bunch.

32:12.932 --> 32:13.697
      You've been served.

32:17.670 --> 32:18.702
    [Frank] Son of a bitch.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.205
         [door closes]

32:21.206 --> 32:23.707
      Frankie is planning
       a trip to Europe,
      just about the time

32:23.709 --> 32:28.145
    Ava leaves to make <i> Pandora</i>
     <i> and the Flying Dutchman</i>
        with James Mason.

32:28.147 --> 32:29.379
  [man] Beautiful. Beautiful.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.048
[man 2] One for your fans, Ava.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.016
        Ava, right here.

32:33.018 --> 32:34.184
           Beautiful.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.702
          Right there.

32:35.703 --> 32:37.219
     -Hey, there is Frank.
         -That's right.

32:37.222 --> 32:38.989
      What are you two doing
       over there in Spain?

32:38.991 --> 32:42.125
      Well, she got some sun
     and I caught a few tuna.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.394
       I was making a movie
         with Hemingway.

32:44.396 --> 32:47.230
    And we were chaperoning
      the whole time just
    like high school dance.

32:47.232 --> 32:50.667
      So Frank, you're gonna
     ask Nancy for divorce so
     you two can get married?

32:50.669 --> 32:53.070
    [Frank] Well, I'm in no
  position for a divorce, so.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.372
Oh come off it, Frank. You blew
   off Nancy on Mother's Day.

32:55.374 --> 32:59.576
     Yeah. Then what next?
  A divorce in Mexico and then
  you two get hitched in Reno?

33:00.479 --> 33:03.013
  How about that one, Francis?

33:03.015 --> 33:05.983
  Hey look, fellas, you know,
  everyone's talking about Ava
    and me getting married,

33:05.985 --> 33:08.219
       except Ava and me.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.454
   Come on, Frank, you snuck
  off to be with her. Come on,
  tell us what's the stories.

33:10.456 --> 33:12.289
     Give me a break, fellas.
      It's just a vacation.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.758
Oh yeah, sure, with a chaperone.
     Yeah, we get it guys.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.327
  Yeah, who is the chaperone,
          Mario Cabré?

33:17.329 --> 33:20.297
    Oh wait, wait, maybe Frank
        was the chaperone.

33:20.299 --> 33:23.734
      Hey Frank, so how'd
     you feel about when he
     started serenading her

33:26.538 --> 33:28.322
      with all the poetry?

33:28.323 --> 33:30.107
    It was a publicity gimmick
      for the film, alright?
     Just back the fuck off.

33:30.109 --> 33:33.210
  Hey, you can't talk like that.
    The press made you, Frank.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.779
   The press didn't make me.
        My singing did,
     your miserable crumb.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.349
      [Ava] What the hell
      was all that about?

33:39.351 --> 33:41.685
      Can't get a divorce
           just now?

33:41.687 --> 33:45.188
 Can you forget those leeches?
        You know I want
      to marry you, baby.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.291
        Actions Francis.

33:48.293 --> 33:49.559
            Actions.

33:53.799 --> 33:54.731
          [loud bump]

33:56.769 --> 33:58.468
    I think I hit something.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.505
       I definitely did.

34:01.507 --> 34:02.806
      I'm gonna tell her.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.377
    You want to see action?
     I'll show you action.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.149
         I will do it.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.523
             Nancy!

34:21.827 --> 34:24.661
     For you, baby, I'm going
      to tell her right now.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.380
             Nancy,

34:43.382 --> 34:47.117
    can you tell Ava that I
    asked you for a divorce?

34:47.119 --> 34:49.219
         Frank, are you
       out of your mind?

34:49.221 --> 34:52.188
     -I wouldn't count on it.
       -Let him go. Go, go.

34:52.190 --> 34:53.223
             -Hey ma.
         -Let him go. Go.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.391
       She's in the car.

34:55.393 --> 34:57.560
    You can't keep a man if he
   doesn't want to be here. Go.

34:57.563 --> 35:00.397
    He brings that white trash
        whore to my house.

35:00.399 --> 35:06.603
   Now the one I feel really
   sorry for is little Nancy.
    She's such a fine woman.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.338
        You just scared
       the kids, alright?

35:08.340 --> 35:10.774
    The kids? Maybe the kids
    should know about daddy.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.143
      Maybe they should know
       all the nights I was
       home alone with them

35:13.145 --> 35:14.845
      while daddy was out
      gallivanting around.

35:14.847 --> 35:17.681
     What gallivanting? I was
  out singing, make the records,

35:17.683 --> 35:19.749
     doing what I gotta do
  to put a roof over our head.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.718
     Is that why you slept
       with Lana Turner?

35:21.720 --> 35:24.738
  I get well with Lana Turner.

35:24.739 --> 35:27.757
 Oh, and a diamond bracelet on
 Marilyn Maxwell so she could
 flaunt it around in my face?

35:27.759 --> 35:30.894
   Hey, you go snooping around,
       I'm not responsible
        for what you find.

35:30.896 --> 35:34.297
 That was in our car, damn it.
    I thought it was for me.

35:34.299 --> 35:37.767
  And then I see her wearing it.
        I felt so stupid.

35:38.737 --> 35:42.772
   You weren't stupid, alright?
     You were my best friend.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.374
        I was your wife.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.643
     I still am your wife.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.679
        But now I'm not
      enough, am I? Am I?

35:51.316 --> 35:52.315
         Not like that.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.620
       You are in love with
         her, aren't you?

35:56.622 --> 36:05.795
  That green-eyed filthy white
 trash whore has got her hooks
in you? You broke your promise.

36:05.797 --> 36:08.632
     What promise? Why you
     talking about promise?

36:08.634 --> 36:10.500
   I had the abortion, Frank.

36:10.502 --> 36:14.571
  You promised me that you would
    change if I took you back.

36:14.573 --> 36:18.175
 And I believed you. You lied.

36:18.177 --> 36:21.745
     You left me alone with
 the kids while you're running
  around with your mob friends

36:21.747 --> 36:26.850
  and this home-wrecking Jezebel
      and I get to read all
     about it in the papers.

36:26.852 --> 36:29.853
       It's not my fault
     what they write in the
    papers, alright, Nancy?

36:29.855 --> 36:33.723
  I'm sorry that Lee Mortimer
  is a rat. He writes whatever
  the fuck he wants to write.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.360
      Ah Francis, wake up.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.931
 It's not the press, it's you.

36:40.933 --> 36:42.799
     You don't give a damn
         who you hurt.

36:44.203 --> 36:48.772
       Just go. Get out.
        Take your suits,
     your hats, your ties.

36:48.774 --> 36:49.706
            Get out.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.610
I think we should get a divorce.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.979
         I'm not gonna
     make it easy, Mister.

36:55.981 --> 36:58.381
 I'm not giving you a divorce.

36:58.383 --> 36:59.749
  Where are you going, daddy?

37:06.558 --> 37:08.592
       Daddy is gonna go
    make a record, cupcake.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.328
Keep an eye on things, will you?

37:20.806 --> 37:24.007
     This will be the third
   separation for the couple

37:24.009 --> 37:30.680
     and with Nancy taking
   the initiative this time,
 it looks like the real thing.

37:30.682 --> 37:34.584
          Items we doubt
     that F Sinatra's parting
    from his wife is a gimmick

37:34.586 --> 37:37.454
    to attract the attention
  he used to get by crooning.

37:37.456 --> 37:40.257
       What's Frankie doing
           in New York?

37:40.259 --> 37:44.628
    It has to do with those
    hearings on television,
    investigating the mob.

37:44.630 --> 37:48.565
He's meeting with the attorneys
at 4:00 a.m. to avoid the press.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.533
    You think they're gonna
    put him on television?

37:50.535 --> 37:52.869
       If they do, it'll be
      like a death sentence.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.974
       If he gets called
     before the committee,

37:57.976 --> 38:01.778
 Harry Cohn will never read him
 for the role of Angelo Maggio.

38:01.780 --> 38:05.015
 Well, can't you do something?

38:05.017 --> 38:07.951
        I mean, we know
       what Harry likes.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.893
     [attorney] You ever have
      any business with any
        of the Fischettis?

38:16.895 --> 38:19.379
        [Frank] No, Sir.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.864
   [attorney] Did either of the
     Fischettis ever give you
   anything to carry into Cuba?

38:23.869 --> 38:24.768
            No, Sir.

38:24.770 --> 38:29.406
     There has been stated
   and certified information

38:29.408 --> 38:31.741
  to the effect that you took
         a sum of money

38:31.743 --> 38:35.478
    in excess of one hundred
  thousand dollars into Cuba.

38:39.584 --> 38:40.750
       That is not true.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.886
       Did you give Lucky
       Luciano any money?

38:42.888 --> 38:44.805
            No, Sir.

38:44.806 --> 38:46.723
    Did you even learn what
    business they were in?

38:48.593 --> 38:49.993
       No, actually not.

38:49.995 --> 38:52.829
    What is your attraction to
   these underworld characters?

38:52.831 --> 38:57.033
    I don't have an attraction
   for them. Some of them were
  kind to me when I started out.

38:57.035 --> 38:59.936
      You want me to believe
          you don't know

38:59.938 --> 39:02.739
     the people we've been
       talking about are
     hoodlums and gangsters

39:02.741 --> 39:08.478
  who have committed many crimes
     and are probably members
    of a secret criminal club?

39:08.480 --> 39:11.381
  Now you're not gonna put me
   on television and ruin me

39:11.383 --> 39:14.684
    just because I know some
    of these guys, are you?

39:16.388 --> 39:18.388
  Nobody's trying to ruin you.

39:24.996 --> 39:27.564
      The Dodgers will leave
      from Brooklyn. That's
       never gonna happen.

39:27.566 --> 39:32.802
  Never say never. Look at the
  Giants. How many games they
  behind in-- in August, huh?

39:32.804 --> 39:34.371
Thirteen games behind in August.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.473
  Yeah, but then now they are
     even with the Dodgers.

39:36.475 --> 39:39.042
     So if they win tomorrow,
      they win the pennant.

39:39.044 --> 39:44.147
You know why I like that rookie
colored kid though, how was he?
        With the Giants.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.882
      -Mays. Willie Mays.
             -Mays!

39:45.884 --> 39:47.517
        He's beautiful.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.486
   He's gonna be a big star.

39:49.487 --> 39:51.454
Hey Carmine, you're gonna watch
 him or you're gonna fuck him?

39:51.456 --> 39:53.757
        -[all laughing]
         -That's true.

39:53.759 --> 39:58.628
 Now, let me ask you something
wise guys, huh? Why do they call
  the Brooklyn's the Dodgers?

39:58.630 --> 40:04.701
  Trolley Dodgers from all the
   trolley racing up and down
 Atlantic and Flatbush Avenue.

40:04.703 --> 40:07.404
       [all overlapping]

40:07.406 --> 40:09.739
  Oh, give it the rest, boys.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.574
  [man] Out of the mountains.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.443
  -Hey, hey. Look who's here.
       -Come on, Frankie.

40:13.445 --> 40:16.479
    Hey. Get over here, you.

40:16.481 --> 40:20.083
  Give me a kiss, you fucking
       Sicilian bastard.

40:20.085 --> 40:24.754
 Sit here near your godfather.
  He'll know. Frankie, what is
 this constellation thing here?

40:24.756 --> 40:27.791
Sure, I flew him, Uncle Willie.

40:27.792 --> 40:30.827
     I flew him to Europe,
  Los Angeles, Havana. He even
  got bunks he could sleep in.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.762
          Even bunks.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.765
       But they could use
     to serve some coffee,
especially on the long flights.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.168
        What, no coffee?

40:38.169 --> 40:40.570
    Howard Hughes, he wouldn't
       even go for coffee?

40:40.571 --> 40:42.972
 Speaking of Howard Hughes, you
 still running around with that
 Ava broad you used to go with?

40:42.974 --> 40:45.542
She's with me now, Uncle Willie.

40:45.543 --> 40:48.111
  Look, Frank, you're a grown
    man, you do what you got
   to do, it's your business,

40:48.113 --> 40:52.182
    but family comes first,
     not that wasp butane.
    [in Italian] Understand?

40:52.184 --> 40:54.651
   Uncle Willie, I take care
   of my kids, you know that.

40:54.653 --> 40:58.721
     I'm talking about Nancy.
       She comes into town,
     she goes to see my wife,

40:58.723 --> 41:01.691
      the two of them are
    like, you know, parrots,
   you know what I'm saying?

41:01.693 --> 41:05.995
[blabbing] You know what I mean?
It's a <i> mala faguda,</i> Frankie. You
 got to-- you got to fix this.

41:05.997 --> 41:09.232
      The-- that twat in the
      newspaper, what's her
       name? Hedda Hopper?

41:09.234 --> 41:11.701
     Ah, what's she saying
        about you Frank.

41:11.703 --> 41:14.371
      I'm not saying you got
       to move in with her

41:14.372 --> 41:17.040
        but you gotta make
   it nice and nice, you know,
   sing her a little love song.

41:17.042 --> 41:20.610
  Hey, remember Slapsie Maxie?

41:20.612 --> 41:22.912
 <i> ¶ Nancy with the Smiling-- ¶</i>

41:22.914 --> 41:24.881
No, no, laughing. Laughing Face.

41:24.883 --> 41:29.552
  <i> ¶ If I don't see her each day</i>
           <i> I miss her ¶</i>

41:29.554 --> 41:31.855
      Knock it off, knock
        it off! Come on.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.556
      Come on, Frankie...

41:35.527 --> 41:37.794
  How you doing? Everything else
   alright? You need anything?

41:37.796 --> 41:39.963
      No, I'm good, don't
      you worry. I'm good.

41:39.964 --> 41:42.131
 Frank, tell Willie about that
 book I always see you reading

41:42.133 --> 41:44.934
  -about the Italian American
      soldier in the war.
    -<i> From Here to Eternity.</i>

41:44.936 --> 41:47.770
It's a terrific book. It's gonna
     make a great picture.

41:47.772 --> 41:50.673
 You're gonna be in a picture?
      Yeah, that's my boy.

41:50.675 --> 41:53.209
 Well, not so fast. I mean they
 haven't given me the part yet.

41:53.211 --> 41:56.096
      You need me to talk
       to somebody here?

41:56.097 --> 41:58.982
   Well, I know the head of the
       studio, Harry Cohn,
         and he knows me.

41:58.984 --> 42:00.950
      Harry Cohn. We know
       this guy, Johnny?

42:00.952 --> 42:04.821
     Yeah, yeah, yeah, that--
      that's the guy that's
        around the Joey A.

42:04.823 --> 42:07.991
 Yeah, gambler. Jew. Big time.

42:07.993 --> 42:11.794
  Matter of fact, he left our
   booster with your partner
      in the marina. Yeah.

42:11.796 --> 42:15.832
 Well, perfect parlay. They go
out to California to tour them,

42:15.834 --> 42:19.102
  they go pay a visit to this
     fucking producer, huh,
      alright Frankie? No?

42:19.104 --> 42:21.871
It's not that easy Uncle Willie.
   This producer Harry Cohn,

42:21.873 --> 42:24.307
he shut out eighty-two thousand
  bucks for the screenwriters.

42:24.309 --> 42:28.278
    I mean he's not just gonna
    give away a part. Besides,
   with this Kefauver Committee

42:28.280 --> 42:31.047
  you can't go out there and
  make waves. It's too risky.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.815
Remember my television with me?

42:32.817 --> 42:35.618
     Mr. Moretti, you were
     a member of the mafia.

42:35.620 --> 42:39.689
       Yeah, come down to
  the shore, I'll show you my
    fucking membership card.

42:39.691 --> 42:44.027
  Besides, when the studio was
 hanging by a thread and I was
  big, I did him a big favor.

42:44.029 --> 42:47.297
       I helped him out.
     So, this guy owes me.

42:47.298 --> 42:50.566
     Alright Frank, let's go.
   I gotta go, guys. Take care.
     I'll see you guys later.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.802
       Bet those fucking
       Dodgers, alright?

42:52.804 --> 42:56.306
   Listen to me, don't worry
 about it, this is no different
    than that fucking leave.

42:56.308 --> 42:58.775
     Besides, after tomorrow,
        how about the 82?

42:58.777 --> 43:01.844
   I'll give it back to him,
  alright? Everything will be
   good. I love you, alright?

43:01.846 --> 43:03.279
   I gotta go set up the bar.

43:03.281 --> 43:04.280
        Excuse me, boys.

43:13.191 --> 43:14.724
   You're a good man, Frank.

43:16.261 --> 43:18.795
  You sing but you don't talk.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.129
      How you doing, Mike?

43:21.032 --> 43:23.600
Watch out for that favor, Frank.

43:23.602 --> 43:27.370
  Willie Moore likes to talk.
  He talks to the reporters,

43:27.372 --> 43:30.073
      he goes on television,
         he makes jokes.

43:31.109 --> 43:32.642
     Not you, right, Frank?

43:33.311 --> 43:36.813
        Hello and goodbye.
    I notice things like that.

    <i> and for talking too much</i>
        <i> to congressional</i>
    <i> investigative committees</i>

44:05.043 --> 44:09.112
      <i> was a known longtime</i>
  <i> associate of another former</i>
  <i> Hasbrouck Heights resident,</i>

44:09.114 --> 44:14.884
  <i> one F. Sinatra, who even sang</i>
   <i> at the wedding of a Moretti</i>
        <i> daughter in 1947.</i>

44:14.886 --> 44:19.288
<i>Despite the declining crooner's</i>
   <i> connection with Moretti and</i>
    <i> other underworld figures,</i>

44:19.290 --> 44:23.059
       <i> Senator Kefauver's</i>
       <i> committee declined</i>
   <i> to call Sinatra to testify</i>

44:23.061 --> 44:25.762
      <i> and thus spared him</i>
      <i> a public lambasting</i>

44:25.764 --> 44:30.433
    <i> that would have no doubt</i>
     <i> finished off a career</i>
    <i> already on life support.</i>

44:30.435 --> 44:32.902
     What's this thing you
      have for the mafia?

44:32.904 --> 44:35.138
       I don't have a thing
          for the mafia.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.740
    Then why are you always
    hanging out with them?

44:37.742 --> 44:42.278
I started singing in New Jersey,
remember? Most of the clubs and
gin mills are owned by the boys.

44:42.280 --> 44:46.749
      But you're not singing
      in New Jersey anymore.
   You're singing in Las Vegas.

44:46.751 --> 44:50.253
  Yeah? Who do you think runs
 that town, the Salvation Army?

44:50.255 --> 44:52.422
   According to Lee Mortimer

44:52.424 --> 44:56.959
you're just a washed-up crooner
who's now a bagman for the mob.

44:56.961 --> 44:58.795
 Yeah, well Mortimer is a fink.

44:59.898 --> 45:03.833
      Now's the perfect time
     for you to cut your ties
        with these people.

45:04.869 --> 45:06.769
      What are you saying?
  Turn my back on my friends?

45:06.771 --> 45:09.289
     It's an Italian thing.

45:09.290 --> 45:11.808
    Yeah, an Italian thing.
    So, it's something you
    wise can't understand.

45:11.810 --> 45:14.777
        Basic human values
   like friendship and loyalty.

45:16.381 --> 45:18.848
       Stop your ranting.

45:18.850 --> 45:21.784
     It's not gonna change
       your public image.

45:21.786 --> 45:25.054
        My public image
     will change once I get
     to play Angelo Maggio.

45:25.924 --> 45:30.359
    <i> From Here to Eternity</i> is
 a whole different ball of wax.

45:30.361 --> 45:33.863
  They're testing heavyweight
 actors for the role you want.

45:33.865 --> 45:36.799
  Harvey Lembeck, Eli Wallach.

45:36.801 --> 45:39.135
Hey, those guys don't scare me.

45:39.137 --> 45:41.170
   They can only play Maggio
       from the outside.

45:41.172 --> 45:44.273
I can play him from the inside.
      I am Angelo Maggio.

45:46.478 --> 45:49.378
       My little tap dancer
        in a sailor suit.

45:52.884 --> 45:56.919
          And I can make
      it happen, especially
    you picking a little help.

45:58.356 --> 45:59.922
            Meaning?

45:59.924 --> 46:02.225
    You are friends with Harry
       Cohn's wife, right?

46:02.227 --> 46:05.161
 So why don't you meet with her
 and then work to her husband?

46:07.265 --> 46:11.968
  Francis, isn't pulling strings
   like that a Hollywood no-no?

46:13.872 --> 46:15.505
             Baby,

46:15.507 --> 46:18.341
   I wanna help, I really do,

46:19.277 --> 46:22.879
     but I've been offered
    a part in another movie.

46:22.881 --> 46:24.080
         Another movie?

46:25.216 --> 46:28.084
      It's called <i> Mogambo.</i>

46:28.086 --> 46:30.319
     John Ford's directing.

46:31.890 --> 46:33.790
     What's the part like?

46:33.792 --> 46:36.993
  It's good, baby. Real good.

46:36.995 --> 46:40.429
    Oh good. Oh good. Yeah.

46:40.431 --> 46:42.398
         -The best catch.
             -Catch?

46:43.468 --> 46:46.269
      -It's gonna be shot
         at a location.
           -Location?

46:47.205 --> 46:50.373
        Yes, in Africa.

46:51.409 --> 46:52.542
            Africa?

46:55.313 --> 46:57.346
 Where did my little guinea go?

47:01.052 --> 47:02.852
         So, a diamond
      is your best friend?

47:07.325 --> 47:09.058
        What do you say
        we get married?

47:11.296 --> 47:12.829
            Francis.

47:15.400 --> 47:18.968
         Good evening,
     Mr. and Mrs. America.
  Hang on to your body socks.

47:20.171 --> 47:22.471
 Frank and Ava to get married.

47:22.473 --> 47:25.241
        Oh baby, I love
       the sound of that.

47:26.244 --> 47:31.147
  [man] Frank Sinatra and Ava
    Gardner got married only
 days after his formal divorce.

47:31.149 --> 47:34.116
    The couple married in a
  private home in Philadelphia

47:34.118 --> 47:39.555
   before slipping away only
   to be spotted the next day
  walking along a Havana shore

47:39.557 --> 47:43.326
          in what anyone
     could call beach attire.

47:46.331 --> 47:51.934
     Truth is the only time
     I'm happy is when I'm
   doing absolutely nothing.

47:51.936 --> 47:54.437
        Whatever do you
      mean by that, dear?

47:55.974 --> 47:57.874
    Anybody want a lollipop?

48:01.946 --> 48:03.546
     Let's put it this way.

48:04.449 --> 48:09.185
  I was going to be a secretary,
    but I'd rather be a star.

48:09.187 --> 48:11.420
 Are you kidding, a secretary?

48:11.422 --> 48:14.924
    You'll be selling yourself
      short. You're a star.

48:14.926 --> 48:17.193
    Hey nice outfit, Frank.
     Hold that. Hold that.

48:19.230 --> 48:22.298
         You remember her
     in <i> Showboat</i> , don't you?

48:22.299 --> 48:25.367
     She held her own with
    Kathryn Grayson, Howard
  Keel. You lit up the screen.

48:25.370 --> 48:28.070
         Come on and have
      a drink with me, baby.

48:28.072 --> 48:31.007
    I'm bored all by myself.

48:31.009 --> 48:34.243
    Not until I make an omelet
         fit for a queen.

48:34.245 --> 48:39.181
      After all, the article
   she's inscribing is entitled
  "Breakfast with the Sinatras."

48:44.155 --> 48:46.389
      How simply adorable.

48:47.692 --> 48:52.662
      I didn't know Frank
    could be so subservient.

48:52.664 --> 48:58.968
   Holding doors, pulling out
chairs, lighting your cigarette.

48:58.970 --> 49:01.604
 Marriage, ain't it something?

49:03.274 --> 49:05.241
 To get back to your question,

49:06.277 --> 49:09.645
I'll go on acting as long as it
  gives me financial security.

49:09.647 --> 49:12.481
       Is it true about you
        wanting a family?

49:12.483 --> 49:15.985
     Well, sure, any time.

49:16.688 --> 49:17.653
           I'm ready.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.725
   God, I look sick, don't I?

49:24.028 --> 49:25.027
           Terrific.

49:25.663 --> 49:27.997
You just gotta eat, that's all.

49:27.999 --> 49:29.165
            <i> Voilá.</i>

49:29.167 --> 49:30.566
       [foreign language]

49:30.568 --> 49:33.703
     That looks absolutely
          scrumptious.

49:35.406 --> 49:39.408
        Frank, they say
      there isn't anything
    you wouldn't do for Ava.

49:39.410 --> 49:43.212
  Sure. Anything for my angel.

49:43.214 --> 49:45.614
 Even doing theater in Nairobi?

49:45.616 --> 49:48.751
   I'd sing namaz if that meant
    being close to you, baby.

49:51.022 --> 49:54.156
        But they say being
          married to Ava

49:54.158 --> 49:56.759
is like sitting on cracked eggs.

49:57.695 --> 50:00.429
     You never know what kind
    of mood she's gonna be in.

50:00.431 --> 50:03.416
           Nonsense.

50:03.417 --> 50:06.402
     The only cracked eggs
  are the ones I used to make
  this omelet. Now let's see.

50:06.404 --> 50:09.338
      Next topic, dearie.

50:11.609 --> 50:15.678
    So, in your country you
    are an actress, right?

50:15.680 --> 50:17.079
              Yes.

50:17.081 --> 50:18.714
        And you speak good
         English, right?

50:18.716 --> 50:21.083
              Yes.

50:21.084 --> 50:23.451
  And in your country possums
    pilot airplanes, right?

50:23.454 --> 50:25.421
             -Yes.
         -Yeah, right.

50:26.491 --> 50:28.624
       God damn it, can't
       you see I'm busy?

50:28.626 --> 50:32.528
     Mr. C, I'm so sorry. Mr.
      Zinnemann, Mr. Adler,
       they just barged in.

50:33.431 --> 50:37.600
    What the hell do you want?
  You can't be out of money, you
  haven't started shooting yet.

50:37.602 --> 50:39.335
        It's the Maggio.

50:39.337 --> 50:41.571
         What about it?

50:41.572 --> 50:43.806
   We keep getting telegrams
      from Sinatra asking
     when he can audition.

50:43.808 --> 50:46.275
        He's saying you
     promised the testing.

50:46.277 --> 50:49.612
 I mean he signs the telegrams
 "Maggio", for crying out loud.

50:49.614 --> 50:52.581
       Mr. Cohn, I think
       we've got our guy.

50:52.583 --> 50:54.867
             Yeah?

50:54.868 --> 50:57.152
   Eli Wallach, stage actor,
   New York, Actors Studio.

50:57.155 --> 50:59.755
 Yeah, I saw him in the roles.
 That's who is. He's brilliant.
      Wasn't he brilliant?

50:59.757 --> 51:01.424
             -Yeah.
  -Works with the Elia Kazan.

51:01.426 --> 51:03.259
          Elia Kazan.

51:03.261 --> 51:05.628
   I think he's a communist.
     I don't need trouble.

51:05.630 --> 51:09.165
     Works? Who said works?
    Fred, I don't think they
   actually worked together.

51:09.167 --> 51:11.267
        Did I mean work?

51:11.268 --> 51:13.368
     He didn't mean work.
     He meant that-- that
     they know each other.

51:13.371 --> 51:15.671
      -Isn't that what you
          meant, Fred?
 -They-- they know each other.

51:15.673 --> 51:18.057
     They know each other?

51:18.058 --> 51:20.442
     Yeah, I mean they met
    a couple of times, once
   or twice at the very most,

51:20.445 --> 51:22.629
    isn't that right, Fred?

51:22.630 --> 51:24.814
     They met at the theater,
        the Actors Studio.

51:24.816 --> 51:27.616
    I mean it's a big theater,
         plenty of seats.

51:27.618 --> 51:29.985
         You know, and
        besides, I mean,

51:29.986 --> 51:32.353
       who has more baggage
  than Sinatra with the divorce,
     living with Ava Gardner?

51:32.356 --> 51:35.858
  You got a point. Okay, fine,
done deal. Now get the hell out
  of here, both of you. Minna.

51:35.860 --> 51:37.526
      This way, gentlemen.

51:37.528 --> 51:40.129
  No kidding, he'll be great.
       This is terrific.

51:40.131 --> 51:43.466
 We already spoke to his agent
     and we can get him for
    twenty-thousand dollars.

51:43.468 --> 51:46.836
       Whoa, whoa twenty
     thousand dollars? Hold
    the wire. Hold the wire.

51:46.838 --> 51:51.373
   Darling, do me favor. Give
me a second now, will you doll?

51:51.375 --> 51:53.359
              Yes.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.344
 Minna, have her wait outside.
        Bye-bye, Lubov.

51:55.346 --> 51:56.378
             Hello.

51:58.883 --> 52:01.684
     -Minna, get me this--
     what's the name again?
         -Eli Wallach.

52:01.686 --> 52:04.720
     Give me this Eli-- Eli
     Wallach's agent on the
     phone. Sit down, boys.

52:04.722 --> 52:07.590
   Twenty-thousand smackers,
     who the hell he think
         he is, Gable?

52:07.592 --> 52:11.894
   Mr. C, Ava Gardner is on the
   line, she's with Mrs. C and
     they've just had lunch.

52:11.896 --> 52:15.464
    Sorry boys, but I need you
     to clear out. Send her,
    what's the name, back in.

52:16.300 --> 52:18.200
            -Lubov.
         -Yeah, Lubov.

52:21.506 --> 52:23.906
         Ava, Ava, Ava.

52:23.908 --> 52:25.574
      Hello, hello, hello.

52:26.611 --> 52:28.344
           I was just
      thinking about you.

52:29.313 --> 52:32.615
     Lee Mortimer here. The
 crowning blow for Frankie boy

52:32.617 --> 52:38.888
is that the Music Corporation of
 America announced its decision
 to withdraw him as his agent.

52:41.526 --> 52:42.625
              Hey.

52:44.395 --> 52:47.263
       How is that very
       bad boy of yours?

52:47.265 --> 52:50.666
       Don't worry darling.
  Mommy's got him under control.

52:52.470 --> 52:54.370
         -I just met--
         -Harry, hello.

52:54.372 --> 52:57.706
       Ms. Ava, or should
       I say Mrs. Frank?

52:59.911 --> 53:03.612
   Claudia was just leaving.
[in Italian] Excuse me, Claudia.

53:04.515 --> 53:06.582
       When are we going
       to work together?

53:06.584 --> 53:09.652
Next time you're in town call my
girl, tell her to pencil you in.

53:09.654 --> 53:12.288
      Oh, come on Harry,
      don't play with me.

53:12.290 --> 53:16.659
      Tell her five o'clock.
   I'll either make you a movie
     star or I'll marry you.

53:23.868 --> 53:26.468
       -[clears his throat]
     -Can I pour you a drink?

53:26.470 --> 53:28.504
      You got a lot of nerve
         calling my wife.

53:28.506 --> 53:29.972
          I love Joan.

53:29.974 --> 53:31.907
  I hope she's feeling better.

53:31.909 --> 53:34.276
   She was under the weather
       when we had lunch.

53:34.278 --> 53:35.578
         You had lunch?

53:36.714 --> 53:38.547
    I'm sure it was lovely.

53:38.549 --> 53:41.951
    You mind telling me what
you talked about at this lunch?

53:43.254 --> 53:47.223
   Harry, you know that no-good
     bastard husband of mine

53:47.225 --> 53:50.326
    is perfect for the role
   of Maggio in this picture
         you're doing.

53:50.328 --> 53:52.361
       Ah, you don't say.

53:52.363 --> 53:55.331
        Harry, the role
       was made for him.

53:57.468 --> 54:01.770
    And I suppose you think
 I should give him an audition,
    huh? It's like chutzpah.

54:03.608 --> 54:05.741
 Don't you want me to be happy?

54:05.743 --> 54:06.475
             Yeah.

54:07.945 --> 54:11.313
       You got more balls
 than half the men I know. So,

54:20.024 --> 54:22.358
        how about we go
     somewhere more quiet,

54:23.661 --> 54:25.261
        talk about this.

54:28.933 --> 54:33.335
    Director Fred Zinnemann
      has gone to New York

54:33.337 --> 54:37.006
     to test stage players
   for <i> From Here to Eternity.</i>

54:37.008 --> 54:41.977
         Meanwhile, Frank
      is still pitching hard
      for that Maggio role.

54:41.979 --> 54:47.983
    The Eternity film could
 open up a completely new phase
  in Sinatra's acting career.

54:47.985 --> 54:51.854
What is so important? Is it Ava?

54:51.856 --> 54:56.058
    It's all the wires that
    you two are desperately
  trying to avoid a crack-up?

54:56.060 --> 54:58.727
   We're having oral battles
but I'm trying to fix it all up.

54:58.729 --> 55:01.830
       Oral battles, sounds
        like pornography.

55:01.832 --> 55:03.465
        Fix her, Frank.

55:03.467 --> 55:06.185
      You don't need no more
       heat from the press.

55:06.186 --> 55:08.904
        Between divorce
   and Nancy and this asshole
   Mortimer, you got plenty.

55:08.906 --> 55:11.907
 Harry, I want to play Maggio.

55:13.010 --> 55:16.779
I know you want to play Maggio.
     I got your telegrams.

55:16.781 --> 55:20.382
           We all got
   your telegrams, sometimes
          twice a week

55:21.552 --> 55:25.554
    You know, Buddy's thinking
      of paving his washroom
       with your telegrams.

55:25.556 --> 55:28.490
     -Harry, me and you go
        way back, right?
             -Yeah.

55:28.492 --> 55:30.726
      The role is written
   about a guy just like me.

55:30.728 --> 55:33.595
      Yeah. But can you play
         a guy like you?

55:34.565 --> 55:35.998
        It is me, Harry.

55:36.000 --> 55:42.838
You must be out of your fucking
 mind. That's an actor's part,
not a crooner. You're a crooner.

55:42.840 --> 55:45.507
      I'm an actor. Come on,
     give me a chance to act.

55:45.509 --> 55:50.512
    What do you from acting?
  You know how to sing and you
can sing with the best of them.

55:50.514 --> 55:52.381
     You know how to dance
   and you got a good smile.

55:52.383 --> 55:56.018
       William Powell knows
      from acting. You don't
        know from acting.

55:56.020 --> 55:58.420
 Give me one more of these. You
 know what I know from acting?

55:59.490 --> 56:04.960
I'm watching a dog like-- what's
  a good dog, Double Dynamite.
        Double Dynamite.

56:04.962 --> 56:07.696
    And I squirm in my seat
  from the pain of my tuchus.

56:09.033 --> 56:10.966
        All right, I admit
         that was dreck.

56:10.968 --> 56:12.868
            But Maggio
     is completely different.

56:15.373 --> 56:19.641
     They are testing serious
       actors. Eli Wallach,
       he's a stage actor.

56:26.050 --> 56:28.050
       -About the money?
    -Who's talking of money?

56:29.687 --> 56:31.554
   But what about the money?

56:31.555 --> 56:33.422
 I used to get a hundred fifty
   thousand a picture, right?

56:33.424 --> 56:36.592
You used to get a hundred fifty
    thousand a picture, yes.

56:36.594 --> 56:37.793
    I'll do it for expenses.

56:38.629 --> 56:40.729
       Give me expenses,
      you got your Maggio.

56:40.731 --> 56:42.631
You want it that bad, huh Frank?

56:42.633 --> 56:44.867
        Harry, it's me.

56:48.506 --> 56:50.572
   We'll see, Frank, we'll see.
      Let me think it over.

56:50.574 --> 56:54.510
 -You are not turning me down?
-I was but we'll see, we'll see.

56:55.546 --> 56:57.012
  You won't regret it, Harry.

56:57.014 --> 56:58.447
        One more thing.

56:59.083 --> 57:01.049
  You tell anybody about this,

57:02.453 --> 57:04.453
         I'll kill you,
      you son of a bitch.

57:08.426 --> 57:09.992
              ¶¶¶

57:10.928 --> 57:13.162
      Frank, are you up to
      Africa to visit Ava?

57:13.164 --> 57:15.164
        I miss my wife.

57:15.165 --> 57:17.165
     I miss my wife. There is
      like lions, baters...

57:17.168 --> 57:18.901
         -Clark Gable.
          -Thank you.

57:18.903 --> 57:21.036
        Hey, Gable shot
        mixed this week.

57:21.038 --> 57:22.621
      What do you got to say
           about that?

57:22.622 --> 57:24.205
   How do you feel about Ava
     working with the King?

57:24.208 --> 57:25.974
  Clark Gable is the greatest
       actor of our time.

57:25.976 --> 57:27.709
    Yeah. You gonna be working
      with Ava on <i> Mogambo</i> ?

57:27.711 --> 57:30.045
   I'm gonna put black paste
   and play a native, okay?

57:30.047 --> 57:31.614
       So, you're not gonna
           work at all?

57:31.615 --> 57:33.182
 I'm gonna sing in a couple of
nightclubs in Nairobi, alright?

57:33.184 --> 57:35.084
   Who's gonna open, Tarzan?

57:35.085 --> 57:36.985
        Very funny. Bing
  Crosby, the greatest singer
      of our time, folks.

57:36.987 --> 57:38.487
     Wait a second, Frank.

57:40.524 --> 57:42.224
           [laughter]

57:42.226 --> 57:44.660
  Stop it, you can't ask that.

57:51.702 --> 57:54.770
      No, Frank is bigger.

57:54.772 --> 57:57.673
    Really? Bigger? No way.

57:57.675 --> 58:01.143
   Thank you, Ndungo. Asante.

58:01.145 --> 58:02.845
   Asante [foreign language].

58:02.847 --> 58:04.046
            Asante.

58:06.150 --> 58:07.649
       [foreign language]

58:10.521 --> 58:11.854
           Hi, papa.

58:11.856 --> 58:13.522
         Hello, ladies.

58:15.626 --> 58:19.561
Evidently, I am your new valet.

58:19.563 --> 58:20.796
          Oh, for me?

58:22.700 --> 58:24.566
    -Here, one for you too.
              -Oh.

58:25.636 --> 58:27.569
  Looks like the King summons.

58:29.773 --> 58:31.840
     Frank is coming over.

58:31.842 --> 58:35.511
         He misses me.
       That little dago.

58:35.513 --> 58:38.247
    Zinnemann finally agreed
 to give him that screen test.

58:38.249 --> 58:39.281
            Did he?

58:39.283 --> 58:45.754
    Well, on the set I don't
  mind having Frank, I got no
   problem with Frank at all.

58:45.756 --> 58:48.641
        Thank you, papa.

58:48.642 --> 58:51.527
      Maybe he'll make us
    that beautiful linguini
       he loves to make.

58:51.529 --> 58:54.530
           Thank you.

58:54.531 --> 58:57.532
    Doctors pumped powerful
   shots of antibiotics into
      actress Ava Gardner

58:57.535 --> 59:02.905
    to beat down a tropical
   infection picked up while
    movie-making in Africa.

59:02.907 --> 59:09.011
     The wife of crooner FS
  apparently made the mistake
    of drinking local water

59:09.013 --> 59:14.216
   in Kenya's nature country
        and laid in pain
     with stomach troubles.

59:14.218 --> 59:18.587
     Meantime, hubby Frank
  did not make any new friends

59:18.589 --> 59:22.658
   walking out on Shirley Jones
     and the set of <i> Carousel.</i>

59:22.660 --> 59:27.696
      Off to Rome perhaps
   to join the little missus
   who's there convalescing.

59:27.698 --> 59:30.065
      Sounds like the little
         missus insisted.

59:30.935 --> 59:32.301
       Who have you told?

59:32.303 --> 59:33.969
        So far just you.

59:33.971 --> 59:35.971
         Is it Frank's?

59:35.973 --> 59:36.905
              Yes.

59:38.842 --> 59:40.075
        I'm pretty sure.

59:40.077 --> 59:41.109
          Pretty sure?

59:41.111 --> 59:45.347
    Half the world's female
     population would throw
   themselves at Frank's feet

59:45.349 --> 59:50.118
    and here you are flouncing
  around with men who wear capes
  and little ballerina slippers.

59:50.120 --> 59:51.753
    Bogie tell you that one?

59:51.755 --> 59:54.723
      Never mind him. What
      are you going to do?

59:58.062 --> 59:59.328
       I'm not having it.

01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:02.731
        It's my insides
      we're talking about.

01:00:03.834 --> 01:00:06.702
      Besides, the studio
      would penalize me.

01:00:06.704 --> 01:00:08.770
It doesn't have to be that way.

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:12.374
        When I had Stephen
     and Leslie, I told those
   sons of bitches to fuck off.

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:16.612
     That was easy for you
    to say, you have Bogie.

01:00:16.614 --> 01:00:20.182
      And you have Frank,
   who lives and dies by you.

01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:22.150
 He is a Catholic, by the way.

01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:25.153
      He would absolutely
  want you to have his child.

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:26.188
              Why?

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:29.958
     So, I can sit at home
         with his baby,

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.731
 cold, hungry, and in the dark
     while he and his rats
      go off chasing tail?

01:00:39.703 --> 01:00:41.136
       Oh for God's sake.

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:44.239
           [exhales]

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:48.210
    There's a clinic in London
        on Harley Street.

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:50.278
    You shouldn't go alone.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.047
      I will go with you.

01:00:52.049 --> 01:00:53.115
           Thank you.

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:03.191
       [Frank] Come here
  and meet me at the airport.

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:06.428
[Ava] I never got your telegram
   with your time of arrival.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.430
           Never got?

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.431
 What, it didn't have Western
 Union office out in the bush?

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:12.768
      Francis, I'm sorry.

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:15.904
       Come on up, baby.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:19.007
             Gable?

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:21.410
       How you getting on
       with Clark Gable?

01:01:21.412 --> 01:01:23.445
         Like a dream.

01:01:23.447 --> 01:01:25.881
      There's a reason why
    they call him the King.

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:28.283
      Are you fucking him?

01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:31.453
       What did you say?

01:01:31.455 --> 01:01:33.355
    I asked you a question.

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:35.891
  Are you fucking Clark Gable?

01:01:35.893 --> 01:01:38.160
 You suspicious son of a bitch.

01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:40.395
  Hey, I know you, that's why.

01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:42.964
      And I know how it goes
       on movie locations.

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:49.204
       King Gable is having
       a big hot thing with
      the Ice Queen herself,

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:51.173
    little Miss Grace Kelly.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:54.476
          You jealous?

01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:56.211
    You're the jealous one.

01:01:58.082 --> 01:02:01.517
       Can't help myself.

01:02:01.518 --> 01:02:04.953
   I mean that last phone call,
    you left me all depressed,
  like, my imagination ran wild.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.093
            Listen,

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:16.164
      I asked you to come
        here, remember?

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:20.502
      So, why don't you quit
    giving me the third degree

01:02:21.772 --> 01:02:23.472
       and come over here

01:02:23.474 --> 01:02:25.373
      and fuck me already.

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:41.923
 You know how much I miss you?

01:02:43.527 --> 01:02:44.960
           Same here.

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:48.230
        You're my fate,

01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:51.433
      you guinea bastard.

01:02:52.836 --> 01:02:56.037
  You're my fate, you redneck
  piece of poor white trash.

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:02.878
       Do you forgive me?

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:07.182
       I forgive you for
       everything you did

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:09.918
and everything you're gonna do.

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:19.561
   Okay. Coming out, the terror
      of Gimbels' basement.

01:03:19.563 --> 01:03:20.562
          Coming out,

01:03:21.865 --> 01:03:22.964
             seven,

01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:26.084
            seven--

01:03:26.085 --> 01:03:28.102
   Don't overdo the slurring
         of your words.

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:33.942
        Most people try
   to hide their drunkenness
  by slowing down their speech

01:03:33.944 --> 01:03:36.578
      and over-enunciating
      everything they say.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.214
    -Where did you learn that?
        -Michael Chekhov.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:43.118
  He's Anton Chekhov's nephew.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.053
        You should take
       classes with him.

01:03:45.055 --> 01:03:48.423
   I'll need no classes, I know
    how to play Angelo Maggio.

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:51.193
       Michael's a magician
           with actors.

01:03:51.195 --> 01:03:54.429
  I don't need that Stanislavski
       bullshit, all right?

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:56.431
    Don't be so damn cocky.

01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:58.033
         I'm not cocky.

01:03:58.035 --> 01:04:00.535
          Truth be told,
      I'm scared, all right?

01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:01.937
       That's all right.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.940
       I get scared when
     I go on stage to sing.

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:06.575
The minute I step on that stage,

01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:10.145
       it's like shazam,

  I become a different person.

01:04:12.883 --> 01:04:14.149
        It's like magic.

     I thought you said you
     couldn't get pregnant.

01:05:41.338 --> 01:05:43.171
      Looks like the doctors
           were wrong.

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:46.441
       Yours, goddamn it.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.476
Is that true? Is it really true?

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:49.644
          I swear it.

01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:55.450
       Hey, then you must
       be thrilled, huh?

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:57.719
      Why do you say that?

01:05:57.721 --> 01:06:01.256
    Oh come on, baby, you love
      kids, you adore them.

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:04.025
    It's true I adore them.

            -But what?

01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:10.298
         I'm not going
       to have this baby.

       Hold the wire now,
       hold on a second.

01:06:13.886 --> 01:06:17.471
  I'm going to fly to London.
     Somebody told me about
   a clinic on Harley Street.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.674
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, a second.

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:23.111
 -I have no say in the matter?
      -No, I'm afraid not.

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:25.146
      Ava, listen, you can't
       do this to me. What
      are you talking about?

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:27.148
 What are you squawking about?

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:30.285
   You have three kids already,
     you don't need any more.

01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:32.654
  -That ain't for you to decide.
       -It sure as hell is.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:35.657
        It's my insides
      we're talking about.

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:39.094
         Have the kid.
    I'll help you raise him.

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:41.730
   It's just not the right time
     for me to have a child.

01:06:41.732 --> 01:06:46.034
 Ava, listen to me. Back when
 Nancy and I were on the skids

01:06:46.036 --> 01:06:47.569
   before Frank Jr. was born,

01:06:48.772 --> 01:06:50.171
       she got pregnant.

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:52.707
  She didn't want to keep it.

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:56.144
       She said the whole
   marriage was an abortion.

01:06:57.681 --> 01:06:59.714
   I didn't stop her because
     I knew she was right.

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:03.084
  Later on, we patched it up.

01:07:04.221 --> 01:07:05.453
        My son was born.

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:09.557
   Not a day goes by I don't
 think about that baby we lost.

01:07:11.495 --> 01:07:13.161
        I need a drink.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:36.877
              Mmm.

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:42.884
 You know what the problem is?

01:08:42.886 --> 01:08:45.620
       -What's the problem?
      -We're too much alike.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:51.392
      We're both selfish,
    independent, possessive.

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:52.493
         Anything else?

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:58.133
       How about hot-headed
         and competitive?

01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:00.635
         And oversexed.

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:05.206
      You're sure as hell
       right about that.

01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:08.542
      Most couple's problems
          begin in bed.

01:09:11.915 --> 01:09:13.781
       I'm fine with bed.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:17.919
       My problems begin
    on the way to the bidet.

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:21.756
       No, your problems
   go back to your childhood.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:25.460
    You were spoiled rotten
 by your brothers and sisters.

       Same goes for you,
  Lord Fauntleroy of Hoboken,
          New Jersey.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:36.237
       But I still love you
      more than I do myself.

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:39.340
       I swear it, baby.

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:42.243
        Listen Francis,

01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:45.580
  this decision is mine alone.

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:47.314
    That means I don't have
    any say in the matter?

01:09:47.317 --> 01:09:50.718
      Exactly. Mine alone.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.719
         Is that clear?

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.886
         Listen to me,

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:55.590
         you go through
      with this abortion,

01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:58.526
 I'll never speak to you again.

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:01.896
  And I have anything to fucking
     do with you ever again.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:08.670
      It's fucking funny?

01:10:08.672 --> 01:10:10.438
            Go away.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.439
            Oh yeah?

01:10:12.676 --> 01:10:13.741
         You want that?

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:16.444
             Fine.

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:18.413
If anybody asks where I'm going,

01:10:19.482 --> 01:10:21.349
    I'll be in Palm Springs

       Oh Dolly, I can't be
      in this way. It would
     break my mother's heart.

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.753

01:16:09.666 --> 01:16:11.799
    Stop talking like that.
      Stop making trouble.

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:13.868
    Don't try to shut me up.

01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:15.636
        You're just afraid
      to commit, that's all.

01:16:15.638 --> 01:16:17.071
      Look who's talking!

01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:27.181
   You don't want commitment.
You want to dominate me like all
  you men do with their women.

01:16:27.183 --> 01:16:30.251
 Francis, I will never let you.

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:33.054
   You will never conquer me.

01:16:33.056 --> 01:16:36.924
    So, you and your little
playmates can just go fuck off.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.027
   Why don't you crawl back
   to the jungle you belong?

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:42.763
    Another word out of you
and I will kick you in the nuts.

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:44.732
      Try it. I'll smash you
        right in the face.

01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:49.804
         My wife and I,
       we were blissfully
    happy for twenty years.

01:16:49.806 --> 01:16:52.006
      And I feel sorry for
    people who don't drink.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:57.211
       When they wake up
  in the morning, it's as good
 as they're gonna feel all day.

01:16:57.213 --> 01:17:00.047
    -Is it true what they say?
           -It's huge.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.951
       Is there any broad
   in here he hasn't fucked?

01:17:05.254 --> 01:17:07.121
     He's a son of a bitch.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:08.923
    There's no one like him.

01:17:10.226 --> 01:17:12.760
         I-- I didn't--
      I really mean that.

01:17:15.365 --> 01:17:16.797
        Well, one down.

01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:18.866
       They all come out
     to see our headliner.

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:23.204
   He used to be big. Direct
 from doing a duet with a dog.

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:29.110
    This guy's going places,
    mostly down. Ladies and
   gentlemen, Frank Sinatra!

01:17:29.112 --> 01:17:30.678
      [audience clapping]

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:34.949
     Last time you're gonna
     see him work in Vegas.

01:17:34.951 --> 01:17:35.950
        Where's the dog?

01:17:38.955 --> 01:17:40.287
       Where's your wife?

01:17:42.058 --> 01:17:43.724
  Where is your fucking wife?

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.921
  Oh damn it, break open some
 windows, get some air in here!

01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:16.057
Wake up, Frank. Frank, wake up.

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:17.224
      Get him on his feet.

01:18:17.226 --> 01:18:18.726
         -Get up. Get up.
           -Up, up, up.

01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:19.960
 We need to call an ambulance?

01:18:19.962 --> 01:18:22.096
      No calls. No calls.
     No ambulance, no cops.

01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:24.799
         Listen, we gotta
     call the studio. He's in
     no shape to do anything.

01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:27.835
      After stalling them
    all night, they'll never
record him again. Frank, Frank!

01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:29.336
  Stand up, come on. Stand up.

01:18:29.338 --> 01:18:31.072
          -[coughing]
          -Atta boy.

01:18:31.074 --> 01:18:32.907
            -Frank!
          -Yeah, yeah.

01:18:32.909 --> 01:18:34.175
         -There you go.
     -He's coming through.

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:35.843
Breathe, breathe, come on. Yeah.

01:18:35.845 --> 01:18:38.079
             -Ava.
    -Forget her. Forget Ava.

01:18:38.081 --> 01:18:40.281
       She is with Artie.

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:42.482
  Frank, she's not with-- look
  at me, she's not with Artie.

01:18:42.485 --> 01:18:44.919
     Hank checked it out.
     She's not with Artie.

01:18:44.921 --> 01:18:47.488
     I knocked on the door.
        She ain't there.
   She ain't gonna be there.

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:49.724
      He got the message,
    that know-it-all prick.

01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:51.892
   Frank, you're supposed to be
  at the studio, not doing this.

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:54.028
 A billion broads in the world
     and you picked the one

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:56.097
    that can take you or leave
     you whenever she wants.

01:18:56.099 --> 01:18:59.467
      Oh, he's got it bad.
   And the boy's been waiting
at the studio for him all night.

01:18:59.469 --> 01:19:02.002
    Put on a pot of coffee,
        we're taking you
     for a walk. Let's go.

01:19:02.004 --> 01:19:04.004
 We ought to call or something.

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:06.440
           -Come on.
   -[Hank] Just walk with us.

01:19:06.442 --> 01:19:07.374
           Let's go.

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:31.132
             Frank.

01:19:34.337 --> 01:19:35.903
       -What do you got?
           -Show him.

01:19:37.874 --> 01:19:41.809
     From Billy Roche's shop.
      On the arm, of course.

01:19:41.811 --> 01:19:42.977
     -They match her eyes.
            -Mm-hmm.

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:44.512
       They're not cheap.

01:19:44.514 --> 01:19:47.314
      No vig for six months,
           but Frank--

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:49.116
        Never mind that.

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.252
     -Got the other thing?
      -[foreign language]

01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:58.926
             Okay.

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.464
     She's gonna love this.

01:20:03.466 --> 01:20:04.465
         It sings too.

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:07.134
       They're stunning.

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:10.571
   Where'd you get the money
to afford them, for God's sakes?

01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:12.373
       Now what kind of
       question is that?

01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:15.242
I'm a nosy broad. You know that.

01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:20.447
       I mean they're real,
           aren't they?

01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:23.184
 Ey! Nothing fake for my girl.

01:20:26.022 --> 01:20:28.422
          Come here! You
        like your present?

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:30.891
         No, I hate it.

01:20:35.565 --> 01:20:37.131
      You didn't have to.

01:20:38.301 --> 01:20:40.434
I'm just happy being your wife.

01:20:41.571 --> 01:20:43.571
         Mrs. Sinatra.

01:20:43.573 --> 01:20:46.273
         Mr. Sin-atra.

01:20:56.919 --> 01:20:58.853
      I love you, Francis.

01:21:05.094 --> 01:21:07.461
  All I ever wanted in the world
       was to be a singer.

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:10.164
              Now

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.399
       you're all I want.

01:21:18.908 --> 01:21:24.245
    So, Harry, are you sure
  there isn't anything in your
 little old war picture for me?

01:21:24.247 --> 01:21:27.548
    I'm sure you recall the
  performance I gave the last
    time we worked together.

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:30.251
  Yes Mercedes, you did good.

01:21:30.253 --> 01:21:33.587
     Minna, get me Sinatra
     on the line and then
     give me Eli Wallach.

01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:35.489
       Well, I did a little
         more than good.

01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:41.295
          You might have
        a point, Mercedes.

01:21:41.297 --> 01:21:42.496
        [phone ringing]

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:52.907
      Darling, I have some
    delicate calls to make.
      I'll tell you what.

01:21:52.909 --> 01:21:56.510
     We'll read the script
  together over lunch and see
  what we come up with, okay?

01:21:56.512 --> 01:21:59.113
         Oh I know we can
  come up with something, Harry.

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:02.549
            Bye now.

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.690
   Another broad with balls.

01:22:09.692 --> 01:22:11.458
       I got Mr. Wallach
      on the line for you.

01:22:13.562 --> 01:22:14.561
             Frank!

01:22:14.563 --> 01:22:16.997
             <i> -Hello?</i>
          -Frankie baby!

01:22:16.999 --> 01:22:19.566
      Maggio was the last
         part we cast.

01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:22.236
        It was between you
         and Eli Wallach.

01:22:22.238 --> 01:22:24.705
    He's one hell of an actor.
         He tested great.

01:22:24.707 --> 01:22:27.408
   That crowd Zinnemann just
 plotzed when he saw the reel.

01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:29.276
         I understand.

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:31.111
          I appreciate
       getting the shot.

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:35.082
     Thank me later. Look,
    he doesn't look Italian.

01:22:35.084 --> 01:22:36.550
     He looks like a Hebe.

01:22:36.552 --> 01:22:38.385
   <i> So, we're going with you.</i>

01:22:38.387 --> 01:22:40.521
     We're going with you,
         you big putz!

01:22:41.424 --> 01:22:44.158
       You hear me, boy?
    Check, you got the part.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:48.295
     Get your tush over to
   Hawaii and start marching.
  You're in the army now, son.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:51.665
        That was Harry.

01:22:53.636 --> 01:22:55.502
    Better pour us a drink.

01:22:55.504 --> 01:22:56.737
           Oh, baby!

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.574
          Sure thing!

01:23:02.044 --> 01:23:03.577
   Better make it champagne.

01:23:04.447 --> 01:23:06.146
           Champagne?

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:13.253
     I'm so happy for you.
    You got it. You got it!

01:23:13.255 --> 01:23:15.055
              ¶¶¶

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:17.491
     I got to go to Hawaii
    and learn how to march.

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:22.396
      Attention, Private!

01:23:22.398 --> 01:23:24.264
              ¶¶¶

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:33.407
      <i> ¶ Oh boy, have you</i>
      <i> Ever got it made ¶</i>

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:40.080
      <i> ¶ He will try to push</i>
           <i> You around ¶</i>

01:23:40.082 --> 01:23:42.649
         <i> ¶ Don't let him</i>
       <i> Make that mistake ¶</i>

01:23:43.652 --> 01:23:47.054
       <i> ¶ Walk like a king</i>
    <i> And stand your ground ¶</i>

01:23:47.056 --> 01:23:50.624
<i>¶ No, you've got what it takes ¶</i>

01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:52.292
          <i> ¶ Oh, boy ¶</i>

01:23:56.298 --> 01:24:01.135
  It's got a script by Joseph
      Mankiewicz, the guy
    who wrote <i> All About Eve.</i>

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:03.604
  Yeah, I know all about him.

01:24:04.507 --> 01:24:06.573
       What kind of part
    has he written for you?

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:10.711
    I'm supposed to play an
 international woman of mystery

01:24:10.713 --> 01:24:13.714
         who goes from
     dancing in a tango bar

01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:16.550
  to marrying one of the richest
        men in the world.

01:24:17.453 --> 01:24:21.288
      I also get to fuck
      every man in sight.

01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:22.656
          Typecasting!

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:23.724
           Damn you!

01:24:25.127 --> 01:24:27.094
     How would you feel if
     I walked out on you?

01:24:27.096 --> 01:24:32.099
      I'm not walking out.
     This is my big chance.
This is a pinnacle role for me.

01:24:33.502 --> 01:24:37.471
      What about <i> From Here</i>
  <i> to Eternity?</i> I need you here
      by my side, damn it!

01:24:37.473 --> 01:24:38.839
       You don't need me.

01:24:38.841 --> 01:24:40.607
    Just pick up the phone.

01:24:40.609 --> 01:24:43.610
    You've got Lana Turner,
        Marilyn Maxwell.

01:24:43.612 --> 01:24:45.312
    Oh, why are you talking
    about Marilyn Maxwell?

01:24:45.314 --> 01:24:48.148
          Don't deny it.
       Lana Turner told me.

01:24:48.150 --> 01:24:49.483
     Lana Turner is a ditz.

01:24:49.485 --> 01:24:54.421
     Not too much of a ditz
  to figure out what you were
     doing behind my back.

01:24:56.292 --> 01:24:59.093
 All right, so I played around.

01:24:59.095 --> 01:25:01.728
       That's just play.
      What we got is real.

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:02.763
           [laughing]

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:07.601
  How do you know what's real?
You'll fuck anything that moves.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:11.271
     Well I guess that leaves
     you out. You hardly move
          when we fuck.

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:13.407
  Go to hell, you wop bastard.

01:25:13.409 --> 01:25:15.776
 You inbred Baptist ice queen.

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:20.214
   You're nothing but a pair
      of vocal cords with
       a nine-pound cock.

01:25:20.216 --> 01:25:22.149
  My pals are right about you.

01:25:22.151 --> 01:25:23.884
        They said you'd be
       the ruination of me.

01:25:23.886 --> 01:25:29.656
     We're perfect replicas
 of each other. You're getting
     just what you deserve.

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:31.325
         Listen to me.

01:25:33.762 --> 01:25:35.312
 If you leave to do this film,

01:25:35.313 --> 01:25:36.863
   I'll kill myself. I swear
  to Christ I'll kill myself!

01:26:23.746 --> 01:26:27.748
    You know how many times
  I called Italy? Morning, day
     and night, no answer.

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:29.783
   I'm at the end of my rope.

01:26:29.785 --> 01:26:33.520
      Take it easy, Frank.
She's probably just rehearsing.

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:36.874
   She had dinner with Bogie
     just the other night.

01:26:36.875 --> 01:26:40.227
 I heard she spent the weekend
     in Spain with Picasso
         and Hemingway.

01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:44.932
      You know what Frank,
  that Picasso can paint some
 really groovy paintings, man.

01:26:44.934 --> 01:26:46.567
     And I mean that, baby.

01:26:46.569 --> 01:26:47.601
     Who else was she with?

01:26:48.737 --> 01:26:50.804
     Uh... Girl, can I get
         some Chiclets?

01:26:52.208 --> 01:26:55.642
     Frank, you got to stop
      trying to reach her.
    It's driving you crazy.

01:26:55.644 --> 01:26:57.511
      You got to concentrate
            and focus.

01:26:57.513 --> 01:26:59.513
How is Monty Clift, by the way?

01:26:59.515 --> 01:27:03.750
    I heard he trained like
    a fanatic for the role,
   even got you to rehearse.

01:27:03.752 --> 01:27:05.986
       Zinnemann worships
    the ground he walks on.

01:27:05.988 --> 01:27:08.255
       I never met a more
    powerful actor. I mean,

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:11.458
     he's taking me to places
    I've never been to before.

01:27:12.494 --> 01:27:14.661
       Is that the end of
       one-shot Sinatra?

01:27:14.663 --> 01:27:16.663
      Howard Hughes says
      he is a homosexual.

01:27:16.665 --> 01:27:20.234
   Oh yeah? Well, he could fuck
  sheep as far as I'm concerned.

01:27:20.936 --> 01:27:23.503
       What matters to me
  is what he gives me on set.

01:27:23.505 --> 01:27:27.541
    I mean we work on every
 scene, every beat, breakfast,
       lunch and dinner.

01:27:27.543 --> 01:27:30.244
     I mean he's taking me
    to a whole other level.

01:27:30.246 --> 01:27:32.446
    Who knows? Maybe you'll
     win an Academy Award.

01:27:32.448 --> 01:27:34.581
         [ladies laugh]

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:38.752
       Oh darling, Frank
       winning an Oscar!

01:27:41.690 --> 01:27:46.293
    Oh, speak of the devil.
  Howard, how are you darling?

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:49.263
    [Howard] Well, look who
     we have here, Howard.

01:27:50.633 --> 01:27:53.867
    I want to get a chair Arte
       and sit down, okay?
       You mind? Thank you.

01:27:54.803 --> 01:27:56.770
        Lovely, lovely.

01:27:56.772 --> 01:27:59.439
   Here we are, the swooner,

01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:01.575
   unhealthy, wartime <i> finale.</i>

01:28:01.577 --> 01:28:03.310
    Yesterday's news, right?

01:28:03.312 --> 01:28:04.878
 Yes, the war is over in Korea.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.514
    Well, what would a draft
    dodger know about a war?

01:28:11.053 --> 01:28:13.620
    You're a cookie full of
   arsenic, aren't you, Lee?

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:15.922
      Well, I take that as
      a compliment, Frank.

01:28:15.924 --> 01:28:19.593
   Howard, why don't you take
your new friend over to the bar
     and get a drink on me?

01:28:19.595 --> 01:28:22.829
    I didn't come here to have
       you buy me a drink.
     I was hoping to see Ava.

01:28:22.831 --> 01:28:25.449
      So where is our little
          kitten, Frank?

01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:28.068
   Why don't you take a long
   walk off a short pier, you
     right-wing creep you?

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:32.372
 Howard, why don't you take it
    easy on my friend here?

01:28:32.374 --> 01:28:34.074
 Wait, she isn't here, is she?

01:28:34.076 --> 01:28:37.377
       She's over in Italy.
         Or is it Spain?

01:28:37.379 --> 01:28:40.047
   Let's leave the sword play
   to Errol Flynn, shall we?

01:28:43.752 --> 01:28:47.454
   Would you like me to make
 you a movie star, little girl?

01:28:47.456 --> 01:28:51.825
  Yes, Mr. Hughes! Make me a big
   movie star like Ava Gardner.

01:28:51.827 --> 01:28:56.963
  You see, Frank, I could just
make another one but that little
 Tar Heel got under your skin.

01:28:56.965 --> 01:28:58.732
     Why I-- you are the--

01:28:58.734 --> 01:29:01.702
  Besides, you don't need her.

01:29:01.704 --> 01:29:03.570
   You have Montgomery Clift.

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:08.342
  Hold on a second, Howard, my--
   my listeners want to know...

01:29:09.044 --> 01:29:10.844
      That son of a bitch
      called me a queer.

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:12.112
   Frank, if the shoe fits...

01:29:12.114 --> 01:29:13.547
       Hey, lay off, Lee.

01:29:13.549 --> 01:29:17.584
     I'm exhausted. I must
    go wash the stench off.

01:29:19.355 --> 01:29:21.989
Why don't you just beat it, pal?

01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:24.624
Frank, you know what I'd like to
do? I'd like to take a picture.
    Would that be all right?

01:29:24.626 --> 01:29:27.728
 Waiter, come on over here and
you know what I want you to do?

01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:30.097
      I want to get Frank
      a bowl of spaghetti.

01:29:30.099 --> 01:29:32.899
 I want to-- I want to see you
   eat the spaghetti, Frank.

01:29:32.901 --> 01:29:35.669
   They got nice little Dago
       wop that you are.

01:29:35.671 --> 01:29:38.272
           You rat--

01:29:38.273 --> 01:29:40.874
       Let me go. Let me
    go. God damn it! Fucker!

      <i> what's the problem?</i>

01:29:44.012 --> 01:29:46.446
      I'm trying to reach
     this number for days.

01:29:47.449 --> 01:29:48.081
            Pavely.

01:29:48.083 --> 01:29:51.752
   Well, how do I know? It's
   someplace outside of Rome.

01:29:51.754 --> 01:29:53.053
      It's United Artists.

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:58.692
       How can the phones
    be out of order? It's a
     fucking movie studio.

01:29:58.694 --> 01:30:00.761
    Well, watch my language?

01:30:00.763 --> 01:30:03.530
        How about this?
   [vulgar talk in Italian].

01:30:12.408 --> 01:30:16.543
     Of all the gin joints
     in all the world, she
    goes walking into mine.

01:30:17.513 --> 01:30:20.480
      Bravo, Frank, Bravo!

01:30:20.482 --> 01:30:25.652
      Bogie owns that but
      yours had more soul.

01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:29.856
 Just words on the page, Monty.

01:30:30.793 --> 01:30:31.958
       Words on the page.

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:34.628
        Without soul, they
       mean nothing, Frank.

01:30:36.098 --> 01:30:40.734
        A character's soul
      is more important than
       the words he speaks.

01:30:41.603 --> 01:30:42.936
      I'll drink to that.

01:30:52.614 --> 01:30:54.948
    It's all about behavior.

01:30:56.485 --> 01:31:00.120

01:31:01.757 --> 01:31:03.523
    Well tell me something,
           professor.

        What's going on
       behind these eyes?

01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:13.667
     I know, Frank. I know.

01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:17.971
Your marriage is falling apart,

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:21.741
        the whole world
    is crashing down on you,

01:31:21.743 --> 01:31:22.943
   it's beating you to death.

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:26.813
     That's Maggio, Frank.

01:31:28.183 --> 01:31:29.583
          Just use it.

01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:33.987
         Use all of it.

01:31:36.492 --> 01:31:37.591
           It's okay.

01:31:40.195 --> 01:31:42.095

   me to the stockade, Prew?

      No, they ain't gonna
   take you to the stockade.

      Don't make a sound.

   You'll still be yellin' when
     they come to get ya out.

       attempted suicide.

  The tempestuous singer, who
  recently reached the parting
   of ways with Ava Gardner,

or where the accident occurred.

    that having reluctantly
   exhausted every effort to
  reconcile their differences,

01:35:46.508 --> 01:35:51.911
     can find no mutual basis
       on which to continue

    playing a dead-end kid,

     The Judas God in person.

  how you sees it? That's what

01:37:16.498 --> 01:37:18.164
I'll take that under advisement.

01:37:19.935 --> 01:37:22.435
Listen Frank, tell me the truth.

01:37:22.437 --> 01:37:25.505
     Who was it this time?
      Hughes? Hemmingway?

01:37:26.575 --> 01:37:29.409
   Maybe another bullfighter?

01:37:29.411 --> 01:37:32.011
        Now why you got
     to come up to this man
   and say a thing like that?

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:33.479
       Easy champ, easy.

01:37:33.481 --> 01:37:39.285
   As a <i> torero</i> you need more
 than a cape and fancy footwork

01:37:39.287 --> 01:37:41.621
      to escape Ava Gardner,
     isn't that right, Frank?

01:37:41.623 --> 01:37:44.074
       Why don't you button
        it up huh, Walter?

01:37:44.075 --> 01:37:46.526
     Yeah, I'll button it up.
       I'll button it up if
       you face the music.

01:37:46.528 --> 01:37:50.563
     We all know who wears
 the pants, who pays the rent,
      but she is not here.

01:37:50.565 --> 01:37:52.966
   Enough of your bullshit.
   Joe, get him out of here.

01:37:52.968 --> 01:37:55.468
 Mr. Winchell, you're going to
 force me to make a comeback.

01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:57.237
      Hey wait, don't put
       your hands on me.

01:37:57.239 --> 01:37:58.972
 Come on, get him out of here.

01:37:58.974 --> 01:38:01.975
      Oh wait, Frank, Frank,
     good luck at the Oscars.

01:38:01.977 --> 01:38:06.179
  I hear they're even putting
  it on television. Isn't that
     something? First time.

01:38:09.117 --> 01:38:10.884
        Why do you even
      talk to that creep?

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:14.287
        Remember Lucky?
       He talked to him.

01:38:14.289 --> 01:38:17.390
     You know what he got?
     The chair. The chair,
      that's what he got.

01:38:19.227 --> 01:38:23.630
      It hurts, Hank, 'cause
   I got a big hole right here.

01:38:23.632 --> 01:38:25.231
 I just can't hide it anymore.

01:38:25.233 --> 01:38:29.269
      Then don't hide it.
 Use the pain. Sing from there.

01:38:29.271 --> 01:38:31.104
Happy songs are bullshit anyway.

01:38:35.143 --> 01:38:36.409
     Go ahead! Go kill 'em!

01:38:40.348 --> 01:38:45.551

01:39:25.727 --> 01:39:29.262
      Nancy, please, huh?
     Make me a few ravioli.

01:39:29.264 --> 01:39:31.664
      Don't they feed you
     at the Academy Awards?

01:39:33.068 --> 01:39:35.702
        I know, Frankie
      misses home cooking.

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.606
      So, you're nervous?

01:39:40.608 --> 01:39:43.242
            Me? Nah.

01:39:43.244 --> 01:39:45.111
  I'm just happy to be there.

01:39:45.113 --> 01:39:46.980
     You know, they nominated
      a lot of heavyweights:

01:39:46.982 --> 01:39:50.750
      Bill Holden, Audrey
     Hepburn, Monty Clift.

01:39:50.752 --> 01:39:54.153
  So, what about your African
  Queen? Isn't she nominated?

01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:58.458
    Oh wait! The paper says
 she's not coming. What was it?

01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:00.093
         Bullfighting.

01:40:00.095 --> 01:40:01.694
            Cliché.

01:40:01.696 --> 01:40:03.696
        Now don't overcook
      the ravioli, will you?

01:40:10.372 --> 01:40:14.007
       You're going to make
     a mess of yourself. When
     are you going to learn?

01:40:16.077 --> 01:40:17.477
      Your kids are here.

01:40:20.081 --> 01:40:22.648
          Hey! Angel.

01:40:22.650 --> 01:40:25.351
    See how nice daddy looks
    for the Academy Awards?

01:40:25.353 --> 01:40:26.686
       Are you going to win
        an Academy Award?

01:40:26.688 --> 01:40:28.488
     Not so fast, cupcake.

01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:29.789
     Mommy thinks you are.

01:40:31.126 --> 01:40:33.393
The terror of Gimbels' basement.

01:40:33.395 --> 01:40:34.660
         Seven, seven.

01:41:35.223 --> 01:41:37.623
    We had him in our jail.

01:41:40.428 --> 01:41:44.297
      Yeah, he's alright.
   He's a good guy actually.

01:41:44.299 --> 01:41:46.365
   He won! Give me the money.

01:41:47.402 --> 01:41:49.268
    You got it, Frankie boy!

01:41:50.105 --> 01:41:51.204
           That's it.

01:41:52.807 --> 01:41:55.108
       -Don't ever doubt
        Frank. Let's go.
     -I won't doubt Frank.

01:42:12.227 --> 01:42:13.359
            Hey Mac!

01:42:14.896 --> 01:42:16.462
      Mac, you all right?

01:42:20.135 --> 01:42:21.200
      I'm all right, pal.

01:42:23.204 --> 01:42:24.437
           Oh, yeah?

01:42:25.607 --> 01:42:28.641
   Could sure use a nightcap.

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:31.676
     Yeah never mind that.
       What do you think
     you're doing out here?

01:42:31.679 --> 01:42:33.179
          She's gone.

01:42:34.782 --> 01:42:36.766
            No show.

01:42:36.767 --> 01:42:38.751
       Who-- who's gone?
   Who are you talking about?

01:42:38.753 --> 01:42:39.852
           The girl,

01:42:41.489 --> 01:42:42.588
           you know.

01:42:43.625 --> 01:42:45.791
       Can't stay together,
        can't stay apart.

01:42:45.793 --> 01:42:47.493
       You know how that
     works, don't you pal?

01:42:47.495 --> 01:42:50.429
        No, what I know
     is that you're drunk.

01:42:50.431 --> 01:42:53.900
     You've been drinking and
  you're sitting here on private
  property, that's what I know.

01:42:53.902 --> 01:42:57.904
By the way, what is this thing?
 How'd you get a hold of that?
    Who does that belong to?

01:42:58.806 --> 01:43:01.691
Would you believe little old me?

01:43:01.692 --> 01:43:04.577
    Oh yeah, how does a fellow
       like you get a hold
    of a thing like that huh?

01:43:04.579 --> 01:43:05.678
           Behavior.

01:43:06.848 --> 01:43:08.881
         It's what goes
      on behind the eyes.

01:43:08.883 --> 01:43:11.884
  What do you got, Josenhans?

01:43:11.885 --> 01:43:14.886
        He's a vagrant,
     publicly intoxicated,
     possibly stolen goods.

01:43:14.889 --> 01:43:16.355
     What do you got here?

01:43:16.357 --> 01:43:18.191
  Who is he calling a vagrant?

01:43:20.795 --> 01:43:22.261
        Congratulations!

01:43:22.263 --> 01:43:26.532
        You had a great
      night tonight, huh?
         Come on, pal.

01:43:26.534 --> 01:43:29.735
    What do you say we give
     you a lift to wherever
        you want to go?

01:43:29.737 --> 01:43:32.505
    What do you think, huh?
     Up you go. That's it.

01:43:33.741 --> 01:43:35.274
         There you go.

01:43:39.214 --> 01:43:40.580
      A big day tomorrow!

01:43:42.483 --> 01:43:44.517
 Sarge, he's a friend of yours?

01:43:44.519 --> 01:43:46.552
      It's Frank Sinatra.

01:43:46.554 --> 01:43:48.387
           -The singer?
              -Yeah!

01:43:48.389 --> 01:43:50.389
       -What, that guy?
       -Yeah, the actor.

01:43:50.391 --> 01:43:52.058
          No kidding.

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:53.726
    [Sergeant] Yeah he just
    won the Academy Award.

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:55.394
     It was on television and
  everything. You didn't see it?

01:43:55.396 --> 01:43:59.332
    [policeman] No. He kept
    talking about some girl.

01:43:59.334 --> 01:44:03.002
[Sergeant] Yeah. If you've been
in this job as long as I have,

01:44:03.004 --> 01:44:06.439
 you always find that there's a
 girl at the end of the story.

01:44:06.441 --> 01:44:08.007
Especially with a guy like that.

01:44:09.577 --> 01:44:10.977
         Frank Sinatra.

01:44:10.979 --> 01:44:14.847
[real Frank] <i> I'm-- I'm terribly</i>
     <i> pleased and if I start</i>
      <i> thanking everybody,</i>

      <i> I'll do a one reeler</i>
    <i> up here so I better not.</i>

01:44:18.019 --> 01:44:19.385
              <i> And</i>

01:44:19.387 --> 01:44:24.257
 <i> I'd just like to say, however,</i>
      <i> that they're doing a</i>
   <i> lot of songs here tonight</i>

01:44:24.259 --> 01:44:25.691
     <i> but nobody asked me.</i>

01:44:25.693 --> 01:44:27.460
        [crowd laughing]

01:44:27.462 --> 01:44:31.597
    [real Frank] <i> I love you</i>
     <i> though. Thank you very</i>
 <i> much. I'm absolutely thrilled.</i>

01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:33.299

              ¶¶¶

01:45:27.889 --> 01:45:29.722
          Okay, boys,

01:45:29.724 --> 01:45:31.624
      let's make a record.

01:45:31.626 --> 01:45:34.560
     One, two, three, four.

01:45:34.562 --> 01:45:36.028
              ¶¶¶

01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:39.799
  Yeah, baby! He's still got it.
        Yeah he's got it.

01:45:40.668 --> 01:45:42.902
    Yeah, go with it, Frank.

01:45:42.904 --> 01:45:49.575
   Howard Hughes really used
his influence to turn the press
     against Frank Sinatra.

01:45:49.577 --> 01:45:52.645
        Ava Gardner had
       a sense of irony.

01:45:52.647 --> 01:45:54.113
   She was very intelligent.

01:45:54.115 --> 01:45:56.482
      And in her own way,
    she was very principled.

01:45:56.484 --> 01:45:57.950
         She never said
         she was a nun.

01:45:57.952 --> 01:46:00.920
      And she was very, very
       much her own person.

01:46:00.922 --> 01:46:04.924
     You know, she was not
    one of these people who
  said a man can run my life.

01:46:04.926 --> 01:46:09.395
   That was not who she was.
 Frank wanted to run her life.

01:46:09.397 --> 01:46:12.064
   I knew Ava Gardner well like
  a lot of people knew her well.

01:46:12.066 --> 01:46:14.800
      I wasn't the only one,
    many people knew her well.

01:46:14.802 --> 01:46:18.938
     She was out and about
     and around and making
  it here and making it there.

01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:23.909
   The only time I ever really,
  really, really saw Frank happy
    was when he was on stage.

01:46:23.911 --> 01:46:27.480
   He was an amazing singer,
     no question about it.

01:46:27.482 --> 01:46:30.883
    And he turned out to be
    a pretty good actor too.

01:46:30.885 --> 01:46:33.486
        Everything that he
       ever did, I watched.

01:46:33.488 --> 01:46:38.157
   Every album he ever made,
   I had. I adored his voice
        and adored him.

01:46:38.159 --> 01:46:40.760
     And I mean after all
     he was Frank Sinatra.

01:46:40.762 --> 01:46:45.898
    I mean there was nobody
  bigger or more charming and
those blue eyes and that smile.

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:53.005
    I'm ninety-three years old
    and I can still smell Ava
        Gardner's perfume.
