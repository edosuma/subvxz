married a man just like them.

11:21.545 --> 11:27.182
I think dogs were easier than
people, even her own children.

11:27.217 --> 11:29.351
After a while, I realized
there was no point

11:29.386 --> 11:32.354
- in fighting for her attention.
- That's very understanding.

11:32.389 --> 11:34.306
I've had a lot of therapy.
[chuckles]

11:34.358 --> 11:36.441
Any idea why someone
would want to kill her?

11:37.477 --> 11:40.362
- No.
- What about your sister?

11:40.397 --> 11:43.315
She's screwed up, but Sarah
couldn't do something like that.

11:43.317 --> 11:47.335
- She's got two convictions of burglary.
- She has a drug problem.

11:47.387 --> 11:48.837
Addicts need money.

11:48.839 --> 11:51.239
Sarah had hit my Mom up
for money all the time.

11:51.291 --> 11:53.484
And when she wouldn't
give her any, Sarah would

11:53.485 --> 11:55.677
get angry at Mom for
loving the dog more than us.

11:55.729 --> 11:57.512
But she wouldn't hurt anyone.

11:57.564 --> 12:02.684
- We'll still need to speak to her.
- She lives on the streets.

12:02.686 --> 12:05.770
You might want to check the
shelters around the South End.

12:05.823 --> 12:08.886
I'll put out a B.O.L.O.
[pen clicks]

12:09.193 --> 12:12.194
[indistinct conversations]

12:13.497 --> 12:15.197
[elevator dings]

12:17.701 --> 12:22.084
- Hey.
- Hey! Is everything alright?

12:25.275 --> 12:28.877
- Kent kissed me.
- What?! On the lips?

12:28.929 --> 12:31.630
Yeah. We were just talking,
and suddenly, he just kissed me.

12:31.682 --> 12:34.766
- Oh, it's like a bad romance novel.
- Yeah, we work together.

12:34.801 --> 12:36.384
- I know.
- He's my subordinate.

12:36.386 --> 12:38.042
- I know.
- Therefore, any romantic

12:38.042 --> 12:39.354
involvement is strictly
out of the question.

12:39.389 --> 12:41.920
I know! 
Are you sure?

12:42.526 --> 12:44.226
I almost forgot.
 How was your interview?

12:44.278 --> 12:45.894
[gasps] 
You're changing the subject.

12:45.946 --> 12:48.730
Yes, I am.
[elevator dings]

12:49.332 --> 12:52.651
- It's gonna be fine.
- So, it didn't go well.

12:52.703 --> 12:55.287
Well, three bankruptcies, two D.U.I.s,

12:55.322 --> 12:58.324
and one arrest for indecent exposure by

12:58.325 --> 13:01.326
the board members has me
convinced... it's gonna be fine.

13:01.378 --> 13:04.546
You really think that
threatening them with exposure

13:04.581 --> 13:07.249
- is the right way to go?
- Yeah.

13:07.301 --> 13:11.303
I mean, I'll keep it quiet.
You know, like a good neighbor would.

13:11.338 --> 13:13.826
Do you have anything case
related to share?

13:13.918 --> 13:16.758
Yes. To figure out how the
poison was ingested,

13:16.810 --> 13:19.394
I had the victim's
stomach contents analyzed.

13:19.429 --> 13:22.814
I found coffee, salmon,
kale, brown rice.

13:22.849 --> 13:26.818
- All were contaminated with strychnine.
- That's a breakfast I'd skip.

13:26.853 --> 13:29.604
But the small amount of
food was not consistent

13:29.656 --> 13:32.407
with the large amount
of poison in her system.

13:32.442 --> 13:34.492
So, I sent a tech over to the house,

13:34.528 --> 13:36.778
and he found salmon,
kale, and brown rice

13:36.830 --> 13:39.948
in a container in the
refrigerator labeled "dog food."

13:40.000 --> 13:42.250
All tested positive for strychnine.

13:42.286 --> 13:44.836
Well, if the poison was in the dog
food, why didn't it kill the dog?

13:44.871 --> 13:46.621
Well, a dog's sense of smell

13:46.673 --> 13:48.957
is 20 times more
sensitive than a human's,

13:49.009 --> 13:51.343
so it's possible that
he smelled the poison

13:51.378 --> 13:54.679
- and refused to eat it.
- And Mona didn't smell it.

13:54.715 --> 13:57.966
- And if she didn't want to waste it...
- She ate it.

13:58.018 --> 14:03.389
So, someone was trying to kill the dog
and Mona just got in the way.

14:16.617 --> 14:17.617
[music]

14:17.618 --> 14:18.868
<i>- Korsak: Dr. Isles.
- Yes!</i>

14:18.920 --> 14:21.620
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- Oh, no. Not ... not at all.

14:21.672 --> 14:23.139
What can I do for you, sergeant?

14:23.174 --> 14:26.675
Jane was filling me in on your theory
about Duke smelling the poison.

14:26.711 --> 14:28.177
- Mm-hmm.
- And I was thinking,

14:28.212 --> 14:30.012
since this dog has no
history of being aggressive,

14:30.047 --> 14:32.448
maybe the bite marks on
her arm are from Duke trying

14:32.449 --> 14:34.850
to pull her out of the
pool trying to save her.

14:34.886 --> 14:37.553
Well, that would be consistent
with the puncture marks I saw.

14:37.555 --> 14:39.105
Did you test for
strychnine in his system?

14:39.140 --> 14:42.108
I'm afraid not. We only used the
blood sample to test for rabies.

14:42.143 --> 14:44.059
But if he was the intended victim...

14:44.061 --> 14:49.565
Then I should do a more
detailed examination of the dog.

14:49.567 --> 14:51.567
So, I will e-mail the
director of animal control

14:51.569 --> 14:53.235
and ask him to release
Duke in our custody.

14:53.237 --> 14:54.954
Thanks, Maura.
[chuckles]

15:03.748 --> 15:05.247
<i>Frankie, did we ever get a hit</i>

15:05.249 --> 15:07.133
on the B.O.L.O. for Mona's daughter?

15:07.168 --> 15:09.585
Nothing. It's like she disappeared.

15:09.587 --> 15:11.921
I started looking into who
else would want Duke dead.

15:11.973 --> 15:14.432
A woman named Delores Klobb
filed 22 complaints

15:14.433 --> 15:16.892
with animal control about
Duke's excessive barking.

15:16.928 --> 15:18.894
That would make me want to kill the dog.

15:18.930 --> 15:20.930
Yeah, especially since
she lives right next door.

15:20.932 --> 15:23.816
- Did we talk to her?
- Well, the uniforms knocked on her door

15:23.851 --> 15:25.151
during the canvassing,
but she didn't answer.

15:25.186 --> 15:27.069
Well, maybe we should
knock a little louder.

15:27.104 --> 15:28.904
Yeah.

15:32.743 --> 15:34.610
[dog barking in distance]

15:34.612 --> 15:35.611
[door closes]

15:35.613 --> 15:36.946
Going somewhere?

15:36.998 --> 15:39.949
I'm moving to Florida.
You come by to help me pack?

15:41.285 --> 15:43.919
Two policemen came by to
interview you this morning.

15:43.955 --> 15:45.004
Only I wasn't home.

15:45.039 --> 15:47.923
I was getting my hair done.
You can ask at the salon.

15:47.959 --> 15:50.176
- Which salon?
- Cuts Galore.

15:50.211 --> 15:52.795
You want to talk about Mona?

15:52.797 --> 15:54.013
Is there something you want to tell us?

15:54.048 --> 15:56.932
- I didn't like her damn dog.
- Because he barked.

15:56.968 --> 15:59.635
Constantly.
And Mona wouldn't do anything

15:59.687 --> 16:01.770
except rub him on the head
and say he was a good dog.

16:01.806 --> 16:03.973
Nobody else around here complained.

16:04.025 --> 16:05.808
Well, maybe it didn't bother them.

16:05.810 --> 16:07.810
They didn't live right
next door like I do.

16:07.862 --> 16:10.145
Maybe they were deaf.

16:10.147 --> 16:13.949
You know, I watch cop shows.
I know what's going on here.

16:13.985 --> 16:17.069
- You think I killed Mona because of Duke.
- Did you?

16:17.121 --> 16:19.321
I have been complaining
about Duke for years.

16:19.323 --> 16:20.990
If I was gonna kill Mona,

16:21.042 --> 16:23.659
it would've been a long time
ago, not now that I'm moving.

16:23.711 --> 16:26.212
And you know, I am not the
only one that didn't like him.

16:26.247 --> 16:28.706
I don't know how many times
I had to listen to that

16:28.707 --> 16:31.166
drug-addict daughter argue
with Mona about that dog.

16:31.168 --> 16:33.602
When was the last time
the daughter was here?

16:39.176 --> 16:40.809
Four days ago.

16:40.845 --> 16:43.846
Oh, and there was that
woman yesterday morning.

16:43.848 --> 16:47.099
- What woman?
- Mona called her Brenda.

16:47.151 --> 16:49.351
She was about 5'3", 120 pounds.

16:49.403 --> 16:52.905
Oh, they got into it, screaming
about bitches and studs.

16:52.940 --> 16:54.356
What's with the notebook?

16:54.358 --> 16:56.692
Oh, I've been writing
down license-plate numbers

16:56.744 --> 16:59.194
ever since we had a string
of break-ins back in the '90s.

16:59.196 --> 17:03.782
I write down the number of
anyone who doesn't belong.

17:03.834 --> 17:07.769
- You wrote down my license plate.
- I don't know you.

17:12.843 --> 17:14.209
I just talked to the woman

17:14.262 --> 17:16.679
who got into it with
Mona yesterday morning.

17:16.714 --> 17:20.683
Her name is Brenda Grady.
She and Mona had a heated debate

17:20.718 --> 17:23.385
because Mona backed out of
an agreement to breed Duke.

17:23.436 --> 17:26.271
Apparently Duke is is like
the Lebron James of dog shows.

17:26.307 --> 17:29.327
I don't know how Lebron would feel
about that comparison. [chuckles]

17:29.490 --> 17:33.195
And she got angry because
there's this big show coming up.

17:33.230 --> 17:37.066
It was the perfect place to...
sell his services.

17:37.118 --> 17:41.403
- Well, angry enough to kill Duke?
- Not angry, but with an alibi.

17:41.405 --> 17:44.373
She's been in Europe over the
last month scouting show dogs,

17:44.408 --> 17:46.125
so she couldn't have
poisoned the dog food

17:46.160 --> 17:47.743
in the time frame that
we're looking at. [sighs]

17:47.795 --> 17:51.046
- Okay, so we're back to Mona's daughter.
- Maybe not.

17:51.082 --> 17:53.165
Brenda told me there's
plenty of dog-show enthusiasts

17:53.217 --> 17:55.334
who would be thrilled to have
Duke out of the competition.

17:55.386 --> 17:57.753
- Thrilled enough to poison him?
- Yeah.

17:57.805 --> 18:00.055
Duke's three biggest rivals

18:00.091 --> 18:04.677
are a Great Dane, a Malamute,
and a standard Schnauzer.

18:04.729 --> 18:06.395
All three of them have been runners-up

18:06.430 --> 18:08.764
at every show that Duke
won over the last year.

18:08.766 --> 18:10.766
Well, it is hard to beat
Lebron in the clutch.

18:10.768 --> 18:13.185
[elevator dings] 
Easy, easy.

18:13.237 --> 18:16.155
- [Duke whines] Oh.
- How did you pull that off?!

18:16.190 --> 18:19.775
- He's in protective custody.
- Aww.

18:19.777 --> 18:23.445
- Who would want to kill you?
- Right?

18:23.497 --> 18:26.949
- Look at that face.
- Aww. [panting]

18:26.951 --> 18:28.450
Hey, you know what?

18:28.502 --> 18:32.087
I wonder if whoever tried to kill him
knows that he's still alive.

18:32.123 --> 18:34.340
When is his competition
that he's supposed to be in?

18:34.375 --> 18:36.458
Every day this weekend
at the Convention Center.

18:36.510 --> 18:39.011
<i>And all three of Duke's
rivals are gonna be there.</i>

18:39.046 --> 18:40.295
We slip backstage using Duke

18:40.348 --> 18:41.797
and catch them off
guard in their own turf?

18:41.849 --> 18:45.884
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey. Want to go undercover?

18:45.936 --> 18:46.935
[barks]

18:46.971 --> 18:50.071
Yes, he does. He does.

18:56.181 --> 18:58.898
Korsak: [laughs]

18:58.934 --> 19:01.050
<i>All right, leash high.</i>

19:01.086 --> 19:04.421
- Your free hand palm up.
- Mm-hmm.

19:04.456 --> 19:07.107
It's important that you lead the dog
with authority and grace.

19:07.159 --> 19:08.458
<i>You're not just showing him off.</i>

19:08.493 --> 19:09.959
You're presenting him to be appreciated.

19:09.995 --> 19:11.861
You know so much about
it, why don't you do it?

19:11.913 --> 19:13.446
Because he's always been led by a woman.

19:13.498 --> 19:15.365
[sighs] 
Is this really necessary?

19:15.367 --> 19:17.784
The best way to get
a reaction from Duke's rivals

19:17.836 --> 19:19.869
- is to beat them. 
- Korsak: And you could do it.

19:19.921 --> 19:21.871
With your height and feminine form,

19:21.923 --> 19:24.374
it accentuates Duke's
masculine line and strength.

19:24.426 --> 19:28.178
Well, you just don't want to do this
'cause you think it looks stupid.

19:28.213 --> 19:30.180
I don't want to do it, but
I do think you look terrific.

19:30.215 --> 19:32.298
Oh, I see a blue ribbon
in your future. [sighs]

19:32.350 --> 19:34.184
- All right, bring him to a stop.
- Okay.

19:34.219 --> 19:35.852
Hold him here in a sit position.

19:35.887 --> 19:39.055
- Good boy.
- Mm.

19:41.026 --> 19:43.860
- Are you appreciating him?
- Absolutely.

19:43.895 --> 19:46.816
- Are you appreciating me?
- More! [chuckles]

19:48.366 --> 19:49.482
Come.

19:50.952 --> 19:53.820
Up. Good boy.

19:53.872 --> 19:55.455
Now, presentation is everything.

19:55.490 --> 19:58.458
This is what they call hand stacking.

19:58.493 --> 20:02.378
That is what I'd call dating.
[laughs]

20:02.414 --> 20:04.214
Jane, if you're gonna
take Duke to the dog show,

20:04.249 --> 20:06.583
you have to know how
to handle him. Come on.

20:06.585 --> 20:08.968
No, you're right. Okay.

20:09.004 --> 20:11.421
I'll just ... I'll try
the trotting thing again.

20:12.924 --> 20:14.891
Okay. Come on, bud, we can do this.

20:14.926 --> 20:17.477
Okay.

20:17.512 --> 20:19.929
<i>[Duke barking] 
See you at the dog show!</i>

20:19.931 --> 20:21.481
[laughing] 
Hey, Jane...

20:21.516 --> 20:23.026
<i>- Frankie: Wait!
- Duke!</i>

20:28.023 --> 20:30.190
Oh! [laughs] 
Hi, Angela.

20:30.242 --> 20:32.859
Hi. I, uh, I brought you a treat.

20:32.911 --> 20:36.579
Sloppy Joe sliders.
Homemade this morning.

20:36.615 --> 20:40.333
- They look so good.
- So, let's sit.

20:40.368 --> 20:42.035
Okay.

20:46.958 --> 20:48.925
Go ahead. Enjoy.

20:53.381 --> 20:55.431
Mmm. Perfection.

20:56.434 --> 21:00.687
- So, how are you doing?
- I think you know.

21:01.466 --> 21:04.390
[silent gulp]
You mean Frankie and Jane?

21:04.442 --> 21:05.975
Bingo.

21:06.027 --> 21:09.479
So, what do you think
is going on with them?

21:09.531 --> 21:13.032
I'm not sure it's my place.

21:15.036 --> 21:16.202
Nina.

21:23.495 --> 21:26.246
<i>Announcer: May we have the
hound group in the ring, please?</i>

21:33.471 --> 21:35.505
<i>[grunting] 
Wait.</i>

21:37.592 --> 21:41.010
[whining]

21:41.062 --> 21:42.679
- No, I can't do ...
- Oh, no, no, no.

21:42.731 --> 21:44.314
Frankie: You got this. 
You got this.

21:44.349 --> 21:45.515
[clears throat]

21:45.567 --> 21:47.254
Okay, come on.

21:48.737 --> 21:50.186
[whines]

21:54.075 --> 21:58.278
Zsa Zsa. Behave.
[whines]

22:05.003 --> 22:07.203
Ooh, ooh, ooh. 
Great Dane, 3:00.

22:07.205 --> 22:08.705
<i>Korsak: That is one big dog.</i>

22:08.707 --> 22:11.374
Could put a saddle on him
and ride him into the show.

22:11.426 --> 22:13.293
Well, let's see how she feels

22:13.345 --> 22:15.428
about competing against Duke today.

22:17.215 --> 22:20.600
<i>Easy.
[Duke panting]</i>

22:22.220 --> 22:24.637
Yes.
Thank you.

22:27.475 --> 22:29.225
[whines]

22:29.227 --> 22:33.229
- What are you doing with Duke?
- Huh? Uh...

22:34.366 --> 22:38.534
- I'm ... I'm standing in for Mona.
- You can't take her place.

22:38.570 --> 22:40.203
Well, she is unable to be here.

22:40.238 --> 22:42.372
I don't give a damn what
Mona is unable to do.

22:42.407 --> 22:45.491
She registered the dog, and if
she's not here, he's disqualified.

22:45.543 --> 22:48.328
Well, I spoke to the judges,
and they say differently.

22:48.380 --> 22:50.246
[chuckles]

22:50.248 --> 22:52.048
I know what she's trying to pull.

22:52.083 --> 22:54.000
She found an Amazon to lead Duke

22:54.052 --> 22:57.637
- so he seems correctly proportional.
- I beg your pardon?

22:57.672 --> 23:00.256
According to American
purebred standards,

23:00.258 --> 23:05.645
- he is 10% too big.
- You need to back up.

23:05.680 --> 23:06.763
[Duke growls]

23:06.815 --> 23:08.264
[Barks] Ah!

23:08.266 --> 23:11.768
- Control that beast!
- I ...

23:11.770 --> 23:14.153
Duke!
[Duke barking]

23:14.189 --> 23:16.189
Duke!

23:19.277 --> 23:21.277
Come on! Get off!

23:21.279 --> 23:22.612
<i>Duke!</i>

23:22.614 --> 23:24.447
No, Duke! 
No! No! No! No!

23:24.449 --> 23:27.283
- Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke.
- Duke, get off.

23:27.585 --> 23:29.035
<i>Good boy.</i>

23:29.387 --> 23:31.788
- Sarah Evans?
- Yeah, that's right.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.290
Guess we can cancel that B.O.L.O.
Come on.

23:34.292 --> 23:36.292
- Who are you people?
- We're the police.

23:36.344 --> 23:41.180
- We've been looking for you.
- Let's go.

23:45.303 --> 23:47.687
What were you doing at
the dog show this morning?

23:47.722 --> 23:50.606
I went to see my Mom. 
What's it to you?

23:50.642 --> 23:52.308
Is that why you ran?

23:52.310 --> 23:55.478
I didn't run till that
damn dog started chasing me.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.397
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

23:57.449 --> 23:59.565
[sighs] I went to my
mother's house this morning.

23:59.617 --> 24:01.117
She wasn't there.

24:01.152 --> 24:04.070
I figured she had to be at the dog
show, so I went looking for her.

24:04.122 --> 24:05.822
- You didn't find her.
- No.

24:05.874 --> 24:09.107
I saw you there with Duke, so...

24:09.142 --> 24:12.378
looked around to find
out what the hell was going on.

24:14.249 --> 24:17.300
Sarah, do you know why your mother
wasn't at the dog show today?

24:17.335 --> 24:21.587
I wouldn't be sitting here if I did.

24:22.807 --> 24:24.474
Your mother was murdered, Sarah.

24:25.509 --> 24:27.176
[chuckles]

24:29.848 --> 24:31.297
W-What?

24:32.734 --> 24:34.650
[stammers] H-How...

24:36.521 --> 24:41.324
- What happened?
- Someone put poison in Duke's food.

24:41.359 --> 24:43.259
He didn't eat it, she did.

24:45.914 --> 24:47.497
No.

24:49.250 --> 24:52.168
- She couldn't have.
- She did.

24:54.756 --> 24:57.239
How is that possible?

24:58.760 --> 25:00.793
<i>I think you know, Sarah.</i>

25:02.130 --> 25:07.600
- Who put the poison in Duke's food?
- It was...

25:07.635 --> 25:10.553
It was me.
[sobbing]

25:12.390 --> 25:15.324
Oh, my god, I killed my Mom.

25:22.331 --> 25:24.047
You're wrong.

25:24.099 --> 25:26.683
My sister may be a junkie,
but she's not a murderer.

25:26.719 --> 25:31.605
She has admitted to putting
the poison in Duke's food,

25:31.640 --> 25:34.808
and it looks like we found
rat poison in her pockets.

25:34.860 --> 25:38.029
- What?
- And we believe that she went

25:38.030 --> 25:41.949
to the dog show this morning
to finish the job.

25:41.984 --> 25:45.485
- I could've stopped this.
- How do you mean?

25:45.538 --> 25:48.956
My... My sister told me she
wanted to kill Duke.

25:48.991 --> 25:50.908
We had a big fight about it

25:50.910 --> 25:53.544
in my Mom's backyard
about two weeks ago.

25:53.579 --> 25:56.663
Okay, why didn't you
tell me this before?

25:56.715 --> 26:00.834
Because my sister was always high,
always talking crazy.

26:00.886 --> 26:02.803
I just never thought she'd really do it.

26:04.723 --> 26:08.790
- What's gonna happen to her?
- Sweetie, that's up to the judge.

26:10.012 --> 26:12.763
Wasn't sure if you wanted him or not.

26:12.815 --> 26:14.648
If you don't, I can
try and find him a home.

26:14.683 --> 26:18.769
No. I'll take him.
It's what my Mom would've wanted.

26:18.821 --> 26:20.562
Well, he's a good guy.

26:28.914 --> 26:30.864
[sighs]

26:30.916 --> 26:32.499
[whines]

26:32.534 --> 26:34.501
[elevator dings]

26:40.593 --> 26:44.544
[indistinct conversations]

26:44.597 --> 26:46.763
Why did you tell Mom we
weren't getting along?

26:46.799 --> 26:49.466
- I didn't.
- I just left the Dirty Robber!

26:49.518 --> 26:51.468
She's all over me about how I treat you.

26:51.470 --> 26:53.770
<i>Jane, I'm telling you I didn't
say a word to her about it.</i>

26:53.806 --> 26:55.973
Then why does she think
I'm a bathroom hog?

26:55.975 --> 26:57.975
- I ...
- Because I told her. [sighs]

26:57.977 --> 27:00.644
- What?
- Frankie: Why'd you tell her?

27:00.696 --> 27:02.145
I told you she was gonna
make a big deal out of it.

27:02.197 --> 27:03.981
And I told you 
she knew you were lying.

27:04.033 --> 27:08.035
I'm really sorry, but she
cornered me... with her cooking.

27:08.070 --> 27:11.038
- Did she make the fresh cannolis?
- Sloppy Joe sliders.

27:11.073 --> 27:13.490
- Wow.
- Yeah, she was playing for keeps.

27:13.492 --> 27:16.493
Right. Don't worry about it.
She's broken the best of us.

27:16.495 --> 27:18.078
She sat me down with those sliders,

27:18.130 --> 27:20.631
and before I knew it, 
I was telling her everything.

27:20.666 --> 27:22.850
<i>Okay, listen.
Just in the future, </i>

27:22.885 --> 27:25.636
when it comes to our mother,
say nothing.

27:25.671 --> 27:27.004
- Mm-hmm.
- Or lie.

27:27.006 --> 27:30.807
- Or run.
- Running's good. [sighs]

27:30.843 --> 27:33.677
[sighs]
Now we're gonna have to deal with it.

27:33.679 --> 27:36.596
- Jane.
- What?

27:36.649 --> 27:40.484
- I'm sorry for being such a bathroom hog.
- It's okay.

27:40.519 --> 27:43.153
And look, I appreciate you
letting me stay with you.

27:43.188 --> 27:45.689
I know it's a pain, but hey,
I'll be out soon.

27:45.691 --> 27:48.692
<i>No, I've liked having you around,
but we both need our privacy, right?</i>

27:48.694 --> 27:51.662
Hey. How did it go with the condo?

27:51.697 --> 27:54.531
- Was it good?
- Not yet.

27:54.583 --> 27:57.034
- But I think it's gonna be.
- I can't believe it.

27:57.036 --> 27:58.669
<i>Both: What?</i>

27:58.704 --> 28:00.170
Your mom said that if I
told her what was going on

28:00.205 --> 28:01.872
with you guys, she'd know
how to get you talking.

28:01.924 --> 28:03.623
<i>[cellphone vibrates] 
And that's what you're doing.</i>

28:03.676 --> 28:06.677
- She's amazing.
- [sighs] She's amazing.

28:06.712 --> 28:09.210
Okay, Maura's got something.

28:16.772 --> 28:19.723
I, um ... I tested for
residue in Sarah's coat pocket.

28:19.775 --> 28:23.810
- Rat poison?
- Yeah, yeah. Just like she said.

28:23.862 --> 28:25.979
Kent, I'm gonna need
to see you in my office

28:26.031 --> 28:29.116
- when I'm done here.
- Oh... Okay.

28:29.151 --> 28:31.568
<i>Um...[clears throat] 
When?</i>

28:31.570 --> 28:34.571
- Uh, give me 20 minutes?
- All right.

28:34.623 --> 28:35.572
- Hi.
- Oh...

28:36.959 --> 28:39.632
- Hi.
- Bye.

28:41.580 --> 28:45.082
[chuckles] You do any more
canoodling in the workplace?

28:45.134 --> 28:46.967
Nobody canoodles anymore.

28:47.002 --> 28:49.136
And we have much more pressing issues.

28:49.171 --> 28:51.888
I don't think that
Sarah killed her mother.

28:51.924 --> 28:53.724
Well, we have a confession.

28:53.759 --> 28:56.893
Yes, she said that she put
rat poison in Duke's food.

28:56.929 --> 28:59.846
Yes.
Which contains strychnine.

28:59.898 --> 29:02.583
And it also contained a
dye that would have turned

29:02.584 --> 29:05.268
Mona's urine bright green
if she'd eaten much of it.

29:05.270 --> 29:08.021
However, her urine sample from
the autopsy came out clear.

29:08.073 --> 29:12.743
Okay, well, what about the tox screen
with all the strychnine in it?

29:12.778 --> 29:15.112
Well, I did a much more
comprehensive analysis

29:15.164 --> 29:18.281
of the strychnine,
and the test revealed

29:18.283 --> 29:21.701
that Mona had two types of
strychnine in her system,

29:21.754 --> 29:23.754
each with a slightly
different molecular structure.

29:23.789 --> 29:25.622
Two different kinds of the same poison?

29:25.674 --> 29:29.259
Yes. One was a more common
version found in most rat poisons,

29:29.294 --> 29:31.928
and the other is a pure
version that we use in medicine.

29:31.964 --> 29:35.799
Mona had a massive
amount of the pure version

29:35.801 --> 29:38.135
and a trace amount
of the common version.

29:39.271 --> 29:42.639
So, you're saying that even
though Mona had the poison

29:42.691 --> 29:45.142
that was in the dog food,
that's not what killed her.

29:45.194 --> 29:48.645
It is likely that the lethal
strychnine was in her coffee.

29:48.697 --> 29:51.031
Which would've passed through
her system more quickly.

29:52.901 --> 29:54.234
<i>Seems like a big coincidence</i>

29:54.286 --> 29:56.236
that two people tried
to poison the same woman

29:56.288 --> 29:58.872
at the same time with two
different kinds of strychnine.

29:58.907 --> 30:01.124
Well, maybe it wasn't a coincidence.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.577
I mean, Trisha knew that
Sarah was gonna poison the dog.

30:03.629 --> 30:05.829
Maybe she just didn't think
she was gonna do it right.

30:05.881 --> 30:08.965
Well, why would she kill her mom?

30:09.001 --> 30:13.003
- Hey, did you find anything?
- You were right. Trisha had motive.

30:13.055 --> 30:15.889
Mona's house had a tax
appraisal of $367,000.

30:15.924 --> 30:18.809
We decided to confirm the
property value with the realtor

30:18.844 --> 30:22.012
<i>and discovered that five
houses near Mona are in escrow.</i>

30:22.064 --> 30:24.147
And every one of them
sold over fair market value

30:24.183 --> 30:25.816
at nearly $1 million each.

30:25.851 --> 30:28.101
Turns out Harbor Hospital
has quietly been buying up

30:28.153 --> 30:30.604
all the houses on Mona's
block in order to expand.

30:30.656 --> 30:32.757
But all the sales are
contingent on closing the deals

30:32.758 --> 30:34.858
on all six properties.
Mona was the only holdout.

30:34.910 --> 30:37.861
She didn't want to move Duke away
from his home and training facility.

30:37.863 --> 30:39.396
<i>Million dollars is a lot of motive.</i>

30:39.431 --> 30:41.364
The only problem with that is
I found her will in the house.

30:41.416 --> 30:43.250
The daughters don't stand
to inherit the estate.

30:43.285 --> 30:47.687
- The dog does.
- So, whoever has the dog has the dough.

30:55.047 --> 30:58.431
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, I did. Come in.

31:10.312 --> 31:13.029
[locks door]

31:23.792 --> 31:27.661
So, you started something in the hallway

31:27.713 --> 31:29.913
that I intend to finish.

31:29.915 --> 31:32.048
Yeah, Maura, um...
[clears throat]

31:32.084 --> 31:34.301
There's nobody around to
interrupt us this time.

31:34.336 --> 31:36.253
No. Um...

31:36.255 --> 31:41.091
- Yes, I, uh, I-I kissed you...
- Yes, you did.

31:41.143 --> 31:46.263
- It's not what you think.
- Well, what I think...

31:46.265 --> 31:51.248
is that you did it to distract me.
[sighs]

31:53.438 --> 31:57.240
- You're a very perceptive woman.
- Not perceptive enough

31:57.276 --> 31:59.993
to understand why you
 needed to distract me.

32:00.028 --> 32:02.329
All I did was ask you
to call that family

32:02.364 --> 32:05.171
and tell them how their
daughter died. [sighs]

32:05.367 --> 32:10.120
Maura, it's really...
it's a really long story.

32:10.172 --> 32:11.788
I'll make time.

32:15.877 --> 32:17.761
[sighs]

32:17.796 --> 32:22.132
You know that in Afghanistan
I was a... an army doctor.

32:22.134 --> 32:25.302
I've been over your
service record, yes. [sighs]

32:25.354 --> 32:27.804
Yeah, well, the ... the hospital was ...

32:27.856 --> 32:30.473
it was right next to this small village.

32:30.475 --> 32:32.809
There was this
18-year-old Afghani kid.

32:32.811 --> 32:34.811
He had to support his entire family.

32:34.813 --> 32:37.113
[chuckles] 
Everybody liked him.

32:37.149 --> 32:40.283
He was a great kid, you
know? So... I hired him.

32:40.319 --> 32:43.203
I got him to run
errands, things like that.

32:44.289 --> 32:48.825
And then one day on his way
to work, he was, uh...

32:48.877 --> 32:50.827
he was hit by a truck.

32:50.829 --> 32:54.080
<i>They brought him in with
massive internal injuries.</i>

32:55.834 --> 32:58.001
When his parents came to the hospital...

33:00.222 --> 33:04.443
and I had to tell them he was ...
that he was dead.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.844
I'm sorry.

33:07.896 --> 33:10.347
[sighs]

33:10.399 --> 33:12.816
I can still hear that mother crying.

33:12.851 --> 33:14.517
[sniffles]

33:14.569 --> 33:18.905
After that, it all just ...
it just became too much, and I...

33:20.575 --> 33:22.859
I decided I didn't want
to be a doctor anymore.

33:22.861 --> 33:25.328
But you must've lost
soldiers in the field.

33:25.364 --> 33:27.247
Yeah, but I didn't have
to deal with their families.

33:27.282 --> 33:28.782
I didn't have to feel their pain.

33:28.834 --> 33:31.868
Simple. 
The C.O. communicated with them.

33:31.920 --> 33:33.420
So, when you left the service,

33:33.455 --> 33:37.207
- you decided to be a medical examiner.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

33:39.211 --> 33:42.472
I figured dealing with
dead bodies would be easier.

33:43.348 --> 33:46.132
Until I asked you to
call the girl's parents

33:46.184 --> 33:48.820
and give them an
official cause of death.

33:51.606 --> 33:54.557
- It's part of our job.
- I know. I know.

33:55.309 --> 33:58.895
And you still haven't done it.

34:01.900 --> 34:04.166
And now you're gonna fire me.

34:05.404 --> 34:11.041
No.
I'm gonna help you.

34:12.878 --> 34:15.462
We believe that your
sister poisoned your mother.

34:15.496 --> 34:19.416
No. I told you I put the
rat poison in Duke's food.

34:19.467 --> 34:22.469
That's not what killed her.
She died from a large dose

34:22.504 --> 34:26.139
- of a more pure kind of strychnine.
- How is that possible?

34:26.174 --> 34:29.092
Well, she knew that you wanted to try
to kill Duke with rat poison.

34:29.094 --> 34:32.094
- You two argued about it in the backyard.
- So what?

34:32.097 --> 34:34.264
The perfect way to cover her tracks.

34:34.315 --> 34:36.399
She figured we'd blame
you for the murder.

34:36.435 --> 34:40.487
- Why would she kill my Mom?
- Money.

34:40.522 --> 34:44.940
- My Mom didn't have any.
- No, but the house is worth $1 million.

34:44.993 --> 34:48.277
No. We don't get any of that.
Both my sister and I knew

34:48.280 --> 34:50.280
that she was leaving everything to Duke.

34:50.282 --> 34:52.916
And with your mother
dead and you in jail,

34:52.951 --> 34:55.918
who do you think becomes
legal guardian of Duke?

34:58.423 --> 35:02.125
- Trisha.
- And she'd control the assets.

35:02.177 --> 35:03.426
She'd get everything.

35:05.964 --> 35:08.498
So, what would you like 
to do about that?

35:11.136 --> 35:12.385
[sighs]

35:30.720 --> 35:34.539
- Why did they let you out of jail?
- Because I didn't kill Mom.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.734
You admitted to putting
the rat poison in Duke's food,

35:36.735 --> 35:38.877
- and she ate it.
- That's not what killed her.

35:38.929 --> 35:41.463
She died from a more
lethal kind of strychnine.

35:41.465 --> 35:44.632
- How?
- Police say someone put it in her coffee.

35:44.634 --> 35:45.633
[barks]

35:45.635 --> 35:49.104
Quiet, boy.
[Duke barking]

35:49.139 --> 35:53.975
- Ah, sounds like Duke is missing Mona.
- Sounds like you're missing Duke.

35:54.027 --> 35:57.562
- I really liked that big guy.
- Well, maybe it's time to get one like him.

35:57.614 --> 36:00.148
Oh, Kiki got ruled by a Rottweiler
when she was a little kid.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.866
She doesn't like big dogs.

36:01.902 --> 36:03.651
- Yeah, but you do.
- I do.

36:03.653 --> 36:07.230
But... I like her more.

36:07.958 --> 36:09.657
<i>Sarah, that doesn't make any sense.</i>

36:09.709 --> 36:11.042
<i>Who would poison Mom's coffee?</i>

36:11.077 --> 36:14.746
Cops don't know.
I think I have a pretty good idea.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.798
You knew I was going to poison Duke,

36:16.833 --> 36:19.860
so you figured the perfect
cover would be to put poison

36:19.861 --> 36:22.887
in Mom's coffee and then
point the cops towards me.

36:22.923 --> 36:25.507
But they didn't even find
a coffee cup at the scene.

36:25.509 --> 36:29.928
- Because you removed it.
- Sarah, why would I kill Mom?

36:29.980 --> 36:32.931
- For the money from the house.
- It's not worth anything, Sarah.

36:32.983 --> 36:35.900
You knew that the hospital
was gonna give her $1 million for it.

36:35.936 --> 36:38.069
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

36:38.104 --> 36:39.487
<i>I don't care.</i>

36:39.523 --> 36:40.688
Sounds like she's telling the truth.

36:40.690 --> 36:41.906
<i>I'll keep my mouth shut.</i>

36:41.942 --> 36:46.027
I'll even cover for the cops with you,
but I want half of that money.

36:46.029 --> 36:49.531
I'm calling the police.
I want this all out in the open.

36:49.583 --> 36:52.730
I didn't poison Mom, 
but I want to know who did.

36:53.787 --> 36:56.754
<i>Duke. [whistles]
[Duke barks]</i>

36:56.790 --> 36:59.791
If she killed her mother, she wouldn't
be bringing the police into it.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.676
So, we're back to square one.

37:01.711 --> 37:05.129
[sighs] Well, whoever killed Mona
had to know two things ...

37:05.182 --> 37:07.465
one, that the hospital
wanted the property.

37:07.517 --> 37:10.552
And two, that Sarah was planning
to kill Duke with rat poison.

37:10.604 --> 37:14.687
Who had access to both
those pieces of information?

37:18.562 --> 37:23.033
Well, Delores stood to gain
a lot with the real-estate deal,

37:23.068 --> 37:24.818
and she told us she
could hear everything

37:24.819 --> 37:26.568
- that went on in that house.
- And a million bucks

37:26.620 --> 37:28.703
will fund a pretty nice
retirement in Florida.

37:28.738 --> 37:30.738
Yes, it would.

37:39.082 --> 37:40.248
[knock on door]

37:44.754 --> 37:47.589
I wouldn't worry about
packing very much, Delores.

37:47.591 --> 37:49.757
You're under arrest for
the murder of Mona Evans.

37:49.759 --> 37:53.511
You don't have anything on me.
I'll sue you for false arrest.

37:53.563 --> 37:55.146
We have a coffee cup that
tested positive for strychnine

37:55.181 --> 37:56.764
with your fingerprints on it.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.516
<i>The next time you want to
throw a murder weapon away,</i>

37:58.568 --> 37:59.901
you should probably pick a dumpster

37:59.936 --> 38:01.686
that isn't as close as
a block from your house.

38:01.738 --> 38:03.557
Put that down, please.

38:10.747 --> 38:13.281
[handcuffs click]

38:13.333 --> 38:16.116
[Duke whines]

38:20.090 --> 38:22.924
<i>Jane: [chuckles]
Korsak: He's a good guy.</i>

38:22.959 --> 38:27.011
- See you later, handsome.
- Thank you.

38:27.047 --> 38:32.934
- You're welcome.
- Take care of this guy, huh? [whines]

38:38.608 --> 38:40.358
[door opens]

38:44.230 --> 38:49.827
<i>- Again, I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.</i>

38:52.322 --> 38:54.122
<i>Thank you.</i>

39:06.052 --> 39:08.636
How'd it go?
[door closes]

39:10.640 --> 39:14.258
Yeah.
I feel better now.

39:14.411 --> 39:17.178
Look, thanks for helping
me through all this.

39:17.230 --> 39:21.349
- It's all part of my job.
- And, uh...

39:21.401 --> 39:23.985
I'd also like to, um...

39:24.020 --> 39:29.190
- apologize for kissing you.
- Apology accepted.

39:29.242 --> 39:31.826
But just so we're clear, I'm your boss,

39:31.861 --> 39:33.745
and the department has very strict rules

39:33.780 --> 39:36.664
- about dating subordinates.
- Understood.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.833
I also want to say that
you're a very good kisser.

39:39.868 --> 39:42.060
- Kent...
- I mean, technically, of course.

39:42.095 --> 39:44.038
Well, thank you. I think.

39:44.090 --> 39:47.091
There is one thing I'd
like to ask you, as my boss.

39:47.127 --> 39:48.760
Mm-hmm.

39:48.795 --> 39:51.412
Is there any rules against
someone from the M.E.'s office

39:51.448 --> 39:56.100
dating someone from, you know,
say the police department?

39:56.236 --> 40:00.129
There are no rules against
going out with police officers.

40:00.853 --> 40:04.726
- Why do you ask?
- Oh, just ... just curious. [clears throat]

40:04.778 --> 40:08.980
Are we talking about a... 
a certain detective

40:09.032 --> 40:10.281
in the police department?

40:16.039 --> 40:18.850
Are you messing with me again?

40:21.878 --> 40:23.377
[scoffs]

40:30.920 --> 40:34.255
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Hey.

40:34.307 --> 40:37.341
I wanted to celebrate
a very exciting turn of events!

40:37.394 --> 40:38.893
Oh. Did Kent call you?

40:38.928 --> 40:41.729
No. The condo board
approved my application.

40:41.765 --> 40:42.430
Really?

40:42.432 --> 40:43.981
- Yes!
- Oh!

40:44.017 --> 40:45.933
It seems that being
able to dish the dirt

40:45.985 --> 40:49.070
on their personal lives did the trick,
so I have a new apartment!

40:49.105 --> 40:50.438
Oh! That's fantastic!

40:50.490 --> 40:53.191
I know! I can't ...
Why would Kent be calling me?

40:53.243 --> 40:58.913
- Oh, I-I think he's interested in you.
- Yesterday, he was kissing you.

40:58.948 --> 41:01.165
That was just him being weird.

41:01.201 --> 41:04.202
- Oh, I think this is you being weird.
- No, no. I've done the math.

41:04.254 --> 41:05.787
He interacts with you

41:05.839 --> 41:07.955
more than any other
woman in the department.

41:07.957 --> 41:11.793
- So?
- So, could you be interested in him?

41:12.095 --> 41:14.011
I've never really thought about it.

41:14.047 --> 41:18.099
- But you're thinking about it now.
- Not really, no.

41:18.134 --> 41:20.968
He's handsome, he's funny,
he has a great job.

41:21.370 --> 41:25.056
- He has all of his teeth.
- He hasn't committed a major crime.

41:25.108 --> 41:28.309
- That we know of.
- Which just meets your standards.

41:28.361 --> 41:30.311
Well, that's why it's
important to keep the bar low.

41:30.363 --> 41:33.197
But I have a new apartment!
[squeals]

41:33.233 --> 41:36.484
- Well, I can't wait to decorate.
- You're not touching it.

41:36.536 --> 41:39.640
<i>- What? But what about the couch?
- I burned it.</i>
