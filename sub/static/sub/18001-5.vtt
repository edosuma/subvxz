00:01.514 --> 00:06.338
(Theme music playing)

00:08.464 --> 00:10.798
Let's say Yoda comes to the stash.

00:10.832 --> 00:12.368
He needs a new jedi apprentice.

00:12.403 --> 00:15.038
He's like, "me look for jedi, I am."

00:15.073 --> 00:17.141
You sound like Jar Jar.

00:17.175 --> 00:18.212
[Laughter]

00:18.246 --> 00:20.085
- Okay, continue.
- All right.

00:20.119 --> 00:22.821
So what do you offer Yoda
that he's gonna pick you, Mike?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.525
I'm in shape for my age.

00:24.560 --> 00:28.775
Will Yoda go, "me not
looking for senior citizen"?

00:28.810 --> 00:30.278
You could do a lot worse.

00:30.312 --> 00:32.283
How about that? That's my pitch to him.

00:32.317 --> 00:33.621
What are you offering Yoda?

00:33.655 --> 00:35.193
The problem is,

00:35.227 --> 00:38.366
Jedis are schooled to
hold back their emotions,

00:38.401 --> 00:39.369
not be emotional.

00:39.403 --> 00:40.872
That's the problem?

00:40.906 --> 00:42.713
Bro, there's no one
less emotional than you.

00:42.747 --> 00:45.385
Like, literally, C.3.P.O is
more emotional than him.

00:45.419 --> 00:47.588
[Laughter]

00:47.623 --> 00:49.227
You might be the strongest candidate,

00:49.261 --> 00:51.301
but look at this guy right here.

00:51.336 --> 00:52.569
He looks like a jedi.

00:52.603 --> 00:54.104
Look at that. That's zen.

00:54.138 --> 00:56.642
But there would be a
greater than 50% chance

00:56.677 --> 01:00.447
of me going to the
dark side... almost 100%.

01:00.481 --> 01:03.890
Ming, I think you're probably
the jedi material at the table.

01:05.629 --> 01:08.932
Come on, jedi. Let's go fold some shirts.

01:08.966 --> 01:10.401
Can I use the force?

01:10.435 --> 01:12.839
[Heroic music]

01:12.874 --> 01:14.846

01:43.245 --> 01:44.980
Hello.

01:45.014 --> 01:46.850
<i>Welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,</i>

01:46.951 --> 01:48.988
the only show that did a threesome

01:49.022 --> 01:50.959
with both aunt may and Ant-Man.

01:50.993 --> 01:52.126
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

01:52.162 --> 01:53.998
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:54.032 --> 01:55.636
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:55.671 --> 01:58.543
Okay, boys, what blew
your minds this week?

01:58.577 --> 02:00.046
Every day, you know,

02:00.081 --> 02:01.950
kind of reminded that
it's a new world out here.

02:01.985 --> 02:04.751
Legalized marijuana,
gay marriage...

02:04.786 --> 02:06.053
what are we talking about here?

02:06.087 --> 02:07.322
You've got those two,

02:07.357 --> 02:08.889
but at the top of the list for me,

02:08.925 --> 02:10.491
it's got to be the Brony Movement.

02:10.525 --> 02:11.625
[Laughter]

02:11.659 --> 02:13.494
Of course.

02:13.528 --> 02:16.165
What a deep social impact this has made.

02:21.874 --> 02:24.576
<i>Hey, guys, I got some
pony comics on my hands</i>

02:24.610 --> 02:26.213
I thought you might be interested in.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.384
<i>Pony comics.</i>

02:28.419 --> 02:30.020
<i>Actually, this says Transformers.</i>

02:30.054 --> 02:31.788
It's a Botcon exclusive.

02:31.822 --> 02:33.624
Botcon's, like, a
Transformers convention?

02:33.658 --> 02:35.327
Yeah, last year,

02:35.361 --> 02:37.428
<i>they had a my little pony
comic, and it was a crossover.</i>

02:37.463 --> 02:39.498
It had pinkie pie and Optimus Prime on it.

02:39.533 --> 02:42.838
This year they went with
DJ Pon-3 and Soundwave.

02:42.872 --> 02:45.107
<i>And they decided to put it on
a Transformers comic instead</i>

02:45.141 --> 02:47.176
since it was BotCon.

02:52.148 --> 02:56.386
80% of Bronies are guys

02:56.420 --> 02:59.222
who are between ages, like, 13 and 25.

02:59.257 --> 03:01.759
I, myself, am one. Like, I go to BronyCon,

03:01.793 --> 03:03.991
- and you see these people with...
- BronyCon?

03:03.991 --> 03:05.228
- BronyCon, yes.
- What's that?

03:05.228 --> 03:06.959
It's the biggest convention
in the world for bronies

03:06.993 --> 03:09.495
to meet, like, buy, sell, trade.

03:09.529 --> 03:12.263
There's cosplay contests,
lots of really cool stuff.

03:12.298 --> 03:16.265
Those people who have no idea
about this subculture of ponies,

03:16.299 --> 03:19.664
they assume that this is geared towards

03:19.698 --> 03:21.898
a five-to a ten-year-old child, right?

03:21.932 --> 03:23.534
- I'll grant you that.
- It's fair, right?

03:23.569 --> 03:24.903
I grant you that.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.138
I have devoted a very generous space

03:27.171 --> 03:29.469
<i>to the pony items
in the stash...</i>

03:29.504 --> 03:31.839
right at the front of the
store where the kids walk in.

03:31.873 --> 03:34.641
$2.99, $3.99 comic book. It's an easy sell.

03:34.675 --> 03:37.539
<i>99% of the people buying those pony comics</i>

03:37.574 --> 03:39.576
are the parents of the
little kids coming in.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.142
This isn't aimed for the little kids.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.909
No, it's not.

03:42.943 --> 03:44.977
It's aimed toward the
adults with the big wallets.

03:45.012 --> 03:48.381
We don't sell high-ticket
items featuring ponies though.

03:48.415 --> 03:50.581
Maybe we should think about it.

03:50.616 --> 03:52.384
Last year, we had a guy come in.

03:52.418 --> 03:56.916
You know, he introduced us
into the concept of the brony.

03:56.950 --> 04:00.216
Is that a tattoo of a pony on your arm?

04:00.250 --> 04:02.085
- Correct, sir.
- That's crazy.

04:02.119 --> 04:04.253
Do you guys know what a brony is?

04:04.288 --> 04:05.655
Bronies?

04:05.689 --> 04:08.258
Perhaps a member of the herd yourselves?

04:08.292 --> 04:09.560
Anybody?

04:09.594 --> 04:11.295
I don't think it's any secret

04:11.329 --> 04:15.098
that Walt's maybe not the
most open guy out there,

04:15.133 --> 04:16.632
that anything that may seem strange

04:16.666 --> 04:17.999
or weird to him, you know,

04:18.033 --> 04:19.635
he immediately writes off.

04:19.668 --> 04:24.839
So it sounds like you are
maybe at best bro-curious,

04:24.873 --> 04:27.006
but he is bro-committed.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.277
[Laughter]

04:29.312 --> 04:30.847
So what are you looking to get for it?

04:30.881 --> 04:34.781
Um, looking to get
maybe $150 for this pair?

04:34.815 --> 04:37.787
- $150 for the pair of these?
- Yeah.

04:37.821 --> 04:39.153
I mean, did this sell that well?

04:39.188 --> 04:40.788
This was a con exclusive,

04:40.822 --> 04:44.656
and it was limited to, like, 750 copies.

04:44.690 --> 04:46.291
I just don't think it's...

04:46.325 --> 04:47.459
it's for the stash, you know?

04:47.493 --> 04:49.693
It's kind of a big-ticket item

04:49.727 --> 04:52.228
that I just don't feel that we could flip.

04:52.263 --> 04:53.495
- All right.
- Sorry.

04:53.530 --> 04:54.797
- Thank you anyways.
- All right.

04:54.832 --> 04:56.100
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

04:56.135 --> 04:57.702
You have a good day. Brohoof.

04:57.736 --> 04:59.869
Brohoof.

04:59.904 --> 05:01.369
He brings up an interesting point.

05:01.404 --> 05:03.239
What interesting point does he bring up?

05:03.273 --> 05:06.709
There are guys out there who
will spend money on this stuff.

05:06.744 --> 05:08.379
There's so much merchandise.

05:08.413 --> 05:09.914
It's... it's crazy.

05:09.949 --> 05:12.014
And costume contest.

05:12.048 --> 05:13.714
Who would want to do that?

05:13.748 --> 05:14.882
There's no way I'm going to a BronyCon.

05:14.917 --> 05:16.218
Why?

05:16.252 --> 05:17.786
Will you enter the cosplay contest?

05:17.820 --> 05:19.289
Right?

05:19.323 --> 05:22.091
You're gonna be disguised half the time.

05:22.124 --> 05:23.855
A little vaudevillian action.

05:23.889 --> 05:25.690
The two-person horse.

05:25.724 --> 05:28.692
- Oh.
- [Laughter]

05:28.727 --> 05:30.426
To be honest, I've always wanted to dress

05:30.460 --> 05:32.862
in one of those
vaudevillian horse costumes...

05:32.896 --> 05:34.967
the two-man horse costume.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.503
You know I love to
kick it old-school, um...

05:37.537 --> 05:41.576
- in a horse costume?
- That's really old-school.

05:41.611 --> 05:44.745
I like to kick it like in the 1910s...

05:44.779 --> 05:47.180
When two men in a horse
suit was entertainment.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.947
Doing the Charleston.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.947
[Laughter]

05:50.982 --> 05:53.778
If I go, you got to be the horse's ass.

05:53.813 --> 05:55.579
I mean, if that gets you down there...

05:55.614 --> 05:56.880
that I got to be a horse's ass...

05:56.915 --> 05:58.311
then I would do it.

05:58.345 --> 06:00.182
- All right, I'm in.
- I would do it.

06:00.217 --> 06:02.222
But if we're dressing up,
you guys got to dress up too.

06:02.256 --> 06:04.195
- Oh, something other than this?
- [Laughter]

06:04.229 --> 06:06.733
Yeah. Let's do it then.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.539
[Groans]

06:09.573 --> 06:11.940
Well, I would say we're
not in Kansas anymore,

06:11.975 --> 06:14.275
but that'd be an understatement.

06:19.659 --> 06:21.060
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

06:21.095 --> 06:23.430
Um, I have some original comic art

06:23.465 --> 06:24.666
that you might be interested in.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.101
Oh, my gosh.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.469
This is a Jerry Robinson Batman sketch

06:28.503 --> 06:29.803
and a phantom sketch.

06:29.837 --> 06:31.203
That is so cool.

06:37.477 --> 06:38.877
Where did you get these?

06:38.912 --> 06:40.312
Actually, they were my brother's,

06:40.346 --> 06:41.816
and they've been passed down.

06:41.850 --> 06:43.820
They've been in our family
for about 60 years now.

06:43.854 --> 06:49.792
He got them at a U.S.O. show
in Korea in 1955 or '56.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.094
They sent comic book artists

06:51.128 --> 06:52.763
to entertain the troops back then?

06:52.797 --> 06:54.831
- Yes.
- Wow.

06:54.866 --> 06:56.900
Who knew that the U.S.O. was like,

06:56.934 --> 07:00.304
"let's bring comic book artists
out to entertain the troops"?

07:00.339 --> 07:02.739
It's amazing, and after their little demo,

07:02.773 --> 07:03.973
they would go into the audience

07:04.007 --> 07:06.076
and do some sketches for the troops.

07:06.110 --> 07:07.610
What a lucky troop is this?

07:07.644 --> 07:09.444
Like, over here, they've
got jayne Mansfield,

07:09.479 --> 07:12.180
and over here, they've
got a guy drawing pictures.

07:12.214 --> 07:13.781
We want Betty grable!

07:13.815 --> 07:15.081
Like, "you got Bob Kane."

07:15.116 --> 07:17.616
[Laughter]

07:17.650 --> 07:19.250
It says, "hello, Roy and Joyce!"

07:19.284 --> 07:20.784
I am the Joyce.

07:20.819 --> 07:22.618
- Oh, you're Joyce?
- Okay.

07:22.653 --> 07:26.121
"Brother Fred tells me here in
Korea what swell kids you are."

07:26.155 --> 07:27.789
Oh, that's nice.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.291
I've found a picture
in his belongings of them

07:30.325 --> 07:33.493
actually on the stage at the fort.

07:33.527 --> 07:35.161
- That is so cool.
- It's hard to see.

07:35.195 --> 07:36.463
But, yeah, it looks like
he's drawing a Batman.

07:36.498 --> 07:37.664
That's got to be Jerry Robinson.

07:37.698 --> 07:39.297
Don't see a lot

07:39.332 --> 07:41.300
of Jerry Robinson artwork
come through the doors.

07:41.334 --> 07:42.335
Almost never.

07:42.369 --> 07:44.136
And the phantom.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.639
He was like a superhero before
superheroes were superheroes.

07:46.673 --> 07:48.008
- Based in the jungles.
- Mm-hmm.

07:48.043 --> 07:49.847
He was Batman, but set in the jungle.

07:49.881 --> 07:52.984
But Wilson McCoy... not that
familiar with that artist.

07:53.018 --> 07:55.656
- Jerry Robinson... big name.
- Yeah.

07:55.690 --> 07:58.524
Jerry Robinson is not
drawing any more Batmans,

07:58.558 --> 08:00.224
so this is rare.

08:00.258 --> 08:02.990
Think about it... one of
Batman's baby daddies...

08:03.025 --> 08:04.960
guy responsible for some of the best things

08:04.994 --> 08:06.295
about the Batman mythos...

08:06.329 --> 08:08.398
Robin, the Joker...

08:08.432 --> 08:10.033
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't forget Alfred.

08:10.068 --> 08:11.566
Alfred!

08:11.601 --> 08:14.036
That... without Alfred,
there is no Batman.

08:14.070 --> 08:15.169
He's a dude alone in a cave,

08:15.204 --> 08:16.635
and people feel sorry for him.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.634
[Laughter]

08:18.668 --> 08:21.235
Any idea what you're looking
to get for both of them today?

08:21.270 --> 08:23.672
I was thinking about $850.

08:23.707 --> 08:28.212
Is there any chance
that you would take, um...

08:28.246 --> 08:30.611
$600 for... for the pair?

08:30.646 --> 08:32.078
We're kind of far apart.

08:32.113 --> 08:35.249
How about $800?

08:35.284 --> 08:38.089
I could do 700 if,
you know you're at 800.

08:38.123 --> 08:41.087
700? Would that work for you today?

08:41.121 --> 08:42.520
I think so.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.622
Yeah, I think my brother
would be satisfied.

08:44.656 --> 08:46.393
Awesome.

08:46.427 --> 08:48.930
I got 100, 200, 300, 400,

08:48.964 --> 08:50.934
500, 600,

08:50.969 --> 08:52.070
and 700.

08:52.105 --> 08:53.106
That's great. Thank you.

08:53.140 --> 08:54.640
Thank you so much.

09:13.196 --> 09:14.864
You can't deny it, man.

09:14.898 --> 09:16.999
Well, I would say we're
not in Kansas anymore,

09:17.034 --> 09:18.735
but that'd be an understatement.

09:18.769 --> 09:20.236
No, I mean, does it look that weird,

09:20.270 --> 09:21.602
or does this remind you of something?

09:21.637 --> 09:23.103
Yeah, it does remind me of something,

09:23.138 --> 09:24.537
my worst nightmare.

09:24.572 --> 09:26.439
Come on, it's like Comic-Con, man.

09:26.474 --> 09:28.241
Look at... you got vendors.
You've got people in costume.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.077
I can't deny that.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.746
There is... there does seem
to be some commerce going on.

09:31.781 --> 09:33.916
That guy was right.
Look at all these people.

09:33.951 --> 09:35.616
There's got to be like 10,000 people here.

09:35.651 --> 09:37.385
So we get down there,

09:37.419 --> 09:39.321
and I'm... I'm definitely
feeling a little self-conscious.

09:39.356 --> 09:41.756
There's way more people than
I assumed would be there,

09:41.790 --> 09:44.392
and I don't know if I want to
be spotted down at BronyCon.

09:44.426 --> 09:46.161
You were nervous? I couldn't tell.

09:46.195 --> 09:48.332
You were scaring away people
the way you were dressed.

09:48.368 --> 09:50.735
He had the hoodie up, and
you were wearing sunglasses.

09:50.770 --> 09:52.337
Like, you looked like
the frickin' unabomber.

09:52.372 --> 09:53.740
He did. He did.

09:53.774 --> 09:56.842
He had a manifesto under his arm.

09:56.876 --> 09:59.178
I mean, there is a lot
of merchandise, right?

09:59.212 --> 10:00.479
- Yeah.
- Look at this thing.

10:00.513 --> 10:02.014
Look at how huge it is.

10:02.048 --> 10:03.782
You sell all those, that's bucks, man.

10:03.816 --> 10:06.085
My niece loves this stuff.

10:06.119 --> 10:08.823
Twilight sparkle, rainbow dash,

10:08.857 --> 10:10.422
applejack,

10:10.457 --> 10:11.423
cutie marks.

10:11.458 --> 10:12.825
So what's this guy do?

10:12.860 --> 10:14.428
She works at the apple farm, man.

10:14.462 --> 10:16.463
Yeah, she's got an apple farm.

10:16.497 --> 10:21.465
Rainbow dash prides herself on
being the fastest pony there is.

10:21.499 --> 10:22.934
What's that purple one?

10:22.968 --> 10:24.369
That's twilight sparkle.

10:24.403 --> 10:26.270
She reports to Princess
Celestia, you know...

10:26.304 --> 10:28.437
the whole "friendship is
magic." You know, she...

10:28.471 --> 10:29.873
how do you know so much about this?

10:29.908 --> 10:31.844
- I have a daughter.
- She's into this?

10:31.878 --> 10:33.643
She's into this. Yeah...

10:33.678 --> 10:36.847
Yeah, little girls and middle-aged
men really dig it.

10:36.882 --> 10:39.518
[Laughter]

10:39.552 --> 10:41.218
All right, well, we've got a couple hours

10:41.253 --> 10:42.818
before the cosplay contest.

10:42.852 --> 10:45.088
- Let's do a little exploring.
- Let's go.

10:47.126 --> 10:48.460
What's up, man?

10:48.494 --> 10:49.727
Where the mares be at?

10:49.762 --> 10:51.763
[Laughter]

10:53.681 --> 10:55.075
This is a weird one, man,

10:55.075 --> 10:58.235
but throughout all of
literature, TV, movies,

10:58.269 --> 11:00.169
pop culture, comic books...

11:00.203 --> 11:01.805
favorite horse?

11:01.839 --> 11:04.154
Hands-down, silver.

11:04.154 --> 11:06.924
Ah, the lone ranger's horse.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.790
It's his Batmobile.

11:08.824 --> 11:11.293
"Hi-ho, silver," right
there in the rally cry.

11:11.327 --> 11:13.193
Zap?

11:13.228 --> 11:14.927
<i>I'm gonna go with Pegasus
from clash of the titans.</i>

11:14.961 --> 11:16.495
<i>Excellent poll, and
beyond clash of the titans,</i>

11:16.530 --> 11:17.798
just in Greek mythology in general.

11:17.832 --> 11:19.501
I don't count that.

11:19.535 --> 11:21.199
You're like, "I don't
like his early work.

11:21.233 --> 11:22.366
I like the more recent stuff."

11:22.400 --> 11:24.634
[Laughter]

11:24.669 --> 11:26.304
What about you, Bry?

11:26.338 --> 11:28.474
- I'd have to go with Mr. Ed.
- Why? Why Mr. Ed?

11:28.508 --> 11:30.641
- Just because he's so well-known?
- He's popular.

11:30.675 --> 11:32.342
I like to jump on the bandwagon
of anything that's popular.

11:32.376 --> 11:34.009
You are. You follow every trend.

11:34.044 --> 11:36.643
People love him, and I love how

11:36.677 --> 11:38.943
he relentlessly breaks his master's balls.

11:38.978 --> 11:40.011
He's like, "oh, wilbur."

11:40.045 --> 11:42.046
[Laughter]

11:42.081 --> 11:44.281
Excellent, excellent poll. Ming?

11:44.316 --> 11:45.516
I'm gonna go with
trigger from Roy Rogers.

11:45.551 --> 11:48.120
[Laughter]

11:48.154 --> 11:50.720
That's... that's old-school, baby!

11:50.754 --> 11:52.154
Kids, I'm picking a horse

11:52.188 --> 11:54.157
even your grandfather don't remember.

11:54.191 --> 11:56.324
[Laughter]

12:07.430 --> 12:09.460
So we walked around the
con for a couple hours,

12:09.494 --> 12:11.362
but then it was time
for the costume contest.

12:11.396 --> 12:13.366
What's the expectation? What do we take?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.735
- We're taking...
- What's up, man?

12:14.770 --> 12:16.635
Where the mares be at?

12:16.669 --> 12:19.671
[Laughter]

12:21.273 --> 12:22.438
Awesome, huh?

12:22.472 --> 12:23.906
How'd you feel in that costume?

12:23.940 --> 12:25.741
I-I thought we looked
damn good, man, right?

12:25.775 --> 12:27.142
[Laughter]

12:27.177 --> 12:28.778
That wasn't even acting.

12:28.812 --> 12:31.480
And for the first time since
the turn of the century,

12:31.515 --> 12:34.784
and I mean the 20th century,

12:34.818 --> 12:38.488
two men got into one horse
costume and made funnies.

12:38.522 --> 12:40.922
[Laughter]

12:40.956 --> 12:42.323
He looks like buffalo bill

12:42.357 --> 12:43.758
and John Wayne Gacy had a love child.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.828
[Laughter]

12:45.862 --> 12:47.830
I'm just gonna walk
out to the front row.

12:47.864 --> 12:50.165
[Laughter]

12:50.199 --> 12:53.605
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I'm Derpy Hooves, baby.

12:53.639 --> 12:56.439
- Yeah, you're Derpy, all right.
- That's crazy.

12:56.473 --> 12:59.306
In the series, someone
Drew one of the ponies

12:59.341 --> 13:01.776
with one eye looking this way
and one eye looking that way.

13:01.810 --> 13:05.112
And I guess it led people to say, like,

13:05.146 --> 13:07.913
you know, she was
special needs or whatever.

13:07.947 --> 13:09.281
And they named her Derpy Hooves.

13:09.315 --> 13:10.749
Hasbro didn't like that,

13:10.784 --> 13:13.953
so they had the name changed to ditzy Doo.

13:13.987 --> 13:15.421
Because, you know, she's ditzy, you know?

13:15.455 --> 13:16.856
Right, right, right.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.491
And to me, I'm like, all right.

13:18.525 --> 13:20.326
Well, special-needs people
have their very own pony

13:20.360 --> 13:21.994
they can identify with,

13:22.029 --> 13:23.626
and hasbro tried to take
it away, so I took it back.

13:23.660 --> 13:25.028
Thumbed my nose at hasbro.

13:25.062 --> 13:28.597
[Laughter]

13:28.632 --> 13:30.032
Look at Mike, though.

13:30.067 --> 13:31.534
You don't look like a pony to me.

13:31.568 --> 13:33.169
No, I'm the veterinarian to the ponies.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.771
I'm keeping it real.

13:34.805 --> 13:36.105
Keeping it real disgusting.

13:36.140 --> 13:37.473
You could have been rainbow dash.

13:37.507 --> 13:38.841
You could have been twilight sparkle.

13:38.875 --> 13:40.321
You could have been,
like, applejack, but...

13:40.321 --> 13:42.146
but he didn't have any of that
stuff laying around the house.

13:42.180 --> 13:44.548
- This he did.
- Yeah.

13:44.582 --> 13:46.782
Yeah, you really did look like
you just left a slaughterhouse.

13:46.816 --> 13:48.618
I was a little gruesome.

13:48.652 --> 13:50.988
You know, because not all
ponies are gonna make it.

13:51.023 --> 13:52.656
You know, some have to be put down

13:52.691 --> 13:54.557
every once in a while.

13:54.591 --> 13:56.358
Why'd you take it there?

13:56.392 --> 13:58.691
Yeah, that was weird, Mike.

13:58.725 --> 14:01.731
[Laughter]

14:03.202 --> 14:04.234
[Crowd cheering]

14:04.269 --> 14:07.033
Oh, it's time, boys.

14:07.067 --> 14:08.567
All right, come on.

14:08.602 --> 14:10.036
Get under there.

14:10.070 --> 14:12.038
Whoo, ooh, ooh, ooh.

14:12.072 --> 14:13.206
- All set?
- Yeah, I'm good.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.208
All right. Let's walk.

14:14.242 --> 14:16.314
No, let's strut.

14:16.348 --> 14:18.117
Uh, wait a second.

14:18.151 --> 14:20.317
So if everybody's at BronyCon,
who's running the store?

14:20.352 --> 14:23.721
- Sunday Jeff and cousin Johnny.
- Really?

14:23.756 --> 14:25.256
Okay, now, Sunday Jeff...

14:25.289 --> 14:27.721
everyone who knows the
show knows Sunday Jeff.

14:27.756 --> 14:30.325
He works on Sundays, hence the name.

14:30.359 --> 14:32.828
But cousin Johnny is
just my cousin, Johnny...

14:32.862 --> 14:35.161
Johnny Willyung, who has
been in some of the flicks.

14:35.196 --> 14:36.663
But you put him behind the camera?

14:36.697 --> 14:38.066
What was that like?

14:38.100 --> 14:39.837
It was kind of an S.O.S. situation.

14:39.871 --> 14:41.840
All hands on deck.
Did you care?

14:41.874 --> 14:43.474
I mean, we were going to a BronyCon.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.709
[Laughter]

14:53.289 --> 14:54.534
<i>- All set.
- All right.</i>

14:54.534 --> 14:55.379
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

14:55.379 --> 14:56.425
Take care now.
You have a nice day.

14:56.425 --> 14:58.080
- You too, now.
- How's it going?

14:58.080 --> 14:59.020
- How you doing, buddy?
- Good.

14:59.020 --> 15:01.428
You guys do monster games?
Oh, yes.

15:01.462 --> 15:03.364
You might want to check this out.

15:03.398 --> 15:07.267
It's a vintage mattel
Godzilla game from 1978.

15:07.301 --> 15:08.434
- There you go.
- Wow.

15:08.469 --> 15:09.736
- Sharp.
- It's pretty cool.

15:16.638 --> 15:18.137
So why don't we take
it out and I'll show you?

15:18.171 --> 15:19.537
Oh, sweet. Is that cool?

15:19.571 --> 15:20.538
Sure.

15:20.572 --> 15:22.005
Is this complete, or no?

15:22.039 --> 15:23.672
It's missing a couple of the spaceships.

15:23.706 --> 15:25.975
But it's complete enough to play.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.309
Lucky seven.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.043
I'll put one down.

15:29.077 --> 15:30.277
You put one down.

15:30.312 --> 15:31.312
Yeah, there you go.

15:31.346 --> 15:33.316
Then I'll go.

15:33.350 --> 15:36.048
And you get eight, so I'll go eight.

15:36.083 --> 15:37.514
[Game roars]

15:37.549 --> 15:39.218
And here comes Godzilla.
So you hear the roar?

15:39.252 --> 15:41.255
And you keep going until
there's one ship left,

15:41.288 --> 15:42.922
and whoever's ship that
is, then that's the winner.

15:42.956 --> 15:44.826
Not to burst your bubble...
I'm bored already.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.598
- What's the next game you got?
- This is awesomeness, dude.

15:46.632 --> 15:48.264
- Oh, come on.
- It is different.

15:48.298 --> 15:49.266
I mean, this is just...
I'm surprised it actually

15:49.300 --> 15:50.768
caught it in its mouth...

15:50.803 --> 15:53.074
- Yeah, yeah. See?
- Being this old of a toy.

15:53.108 --> 15:54.574
And he roared.

15:54.609 --> 15:55.941
That, I think, is the
coolest thing about it.

15:55.976 --> 15:57.409
- So it's good times.
- All right.

15:57.443 --> 15:58.843
- Now the important question.
- Yeah.

15:58.878 --> 16:00.411
How much you looking to get for it?

16:00.445 --> 16:02.577
Uh, I was thinking 200.

16:02.612 --> 16:04.676
- 200?
- Yeah.

16:04.710 --> 16:07.013
- Wow.
- 200?

16:07.047 --> 16:08.882
I mean, honestly, I don't think

16:08.917 --> 16:10.751
this is really a piece for the stash.

16:10.786 --> 16:12.287
Okay.

16:12.321 --> 16:13.423
But tell you what I'm gonna do.

16:13.457 --> 16:15.226
It's a piece for me.

16:15.260 --> 16:19.529
However, $200...You're not
gonna get from me either.

16:19.563 --> 16:20.531
Dude, it roars.

16:20.566 --> 16:22.034
Yeah, but, you know,

16:22.069 --> 16:25.870
I can roar too, and it's not gonna be $200.

16:25.904 --> 16:27.771
I would go 75 on it, for me personally.

16:27.805 --> 16:29.205
Can you do $175?

16:29.240 --> 16:31.041
Nah, that's still too much.

16:31.076 --> 16:32.810
I mean, the best I'd
probably be able to give you

16:32.845 --> 16:34.045
is a hundred bucks.

16:34.079 --> 16:36.649
Mmm.

16:36.683 --> 16:38.953
Nah, it's gotta be...
gotta be that or nothing.

16:38.987 --> 16:40.390
175.

16:40.424 --> 16:42.225
All right, well, John, looks like

16:42.260 --> 16:43.960
you ain't coming over to my
house and playing Godzilla.

16:43.994 --> 16:45.160
- It's a cool game too.
- Well, thank you for your time.

16:45.194 --> 16:46.562
- I appreciate it.
- Yeah, sure.

16:46.597 --> 16:47.965
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Thank you, man.

16:47.999 --> 16:48.997
- Was good meeting you guys.
- Cool piece.

16:49.032 --> 16:50.297
Appreciate it. Thank you.

16:50.331 --> 16:51.865
You all ready to see some cosplays?

16:51.899 --> 16:55.004
[Cheers and applause]

16:55.038 --> 16:57.908
Ditzy Doo never, Derpy forever!

16:57.942 --> 16:59.678
[Cheers and applause]

17:02.766 --> 17:05.405
You all ready to see some, uh, cosplays?

17:05.439 --> 17:06.942
[Cheers and applause]

17:06.976 --> 17:08.944
BronyCon 2014,

17:08.979 --> 17:11.779
it is time to get the
cosplay contest started.

17:11.815 --> 17:12.983
Let's hear it!

17:13.017 --> 17:15.119
[Cheers and applause]

17:24.637 --> 17:28.175
We have Vladimir
cosplaying as Fluttershy.

17:28.210 --> 17:30.178
[Cheers and applause]

17:30.212 --> 17:33.612
Next up is John as twilight sparkle.

17:35.013 --> 17:38.883
We have Robert cosplaying as DJ Dischord.

17:42.288 --> 17:44.624
So the brony cosplay contest begins,

17:44.658 --> 17:48.095
and it's just a ton of
bronies going out on stage

17:48.129 --> 17:49.595
and strutting their stuff.

17:49.630 --> 17:54.297
Walt and Ming as twilight stash.

17:54.332 --> 17:57.764
Well, this is one for the books.

17:57.797 --> 18:00.098
I like that they borrowed
Ronald McDonald's hair.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.767
I heard after this event,

18:01.801 --> 18:05.704
they're providing pony
rides outside the door.

18:05.739 --> 18:07.009
Oh!

18:07.043 --> 18:09.843
I thought he just had four legs!

18:09.877 --> 18:11.610
The crowd went nuts
when we walked out there.

18:11.645 --> 18:13.311
I thought they were
gonna storm the stage.

18:13.346 --> 18:17.050
Everything old is new again!

18:17.084 --> 18:18.851
I mean, we were...
I mean, I'm not gonna lie.

18:18.885 --> 18:20.554
I stayed out there a little bit
extra longer because, I mean,

18:20.588 --> 18:21.622
they wanted more.

18:21.656 --> 18:23.457
They wanted more two-stepping.

18:23.491 --> 18:24.490
Took another victory lap,

18:24.525 --> 18:25.858
- did you?
- Yeah.

18:25.892 --> 18:27.126
He's like, "now I know how Bono

18:27.160 --> 18:29.626
feels when he steps out on that stage."

18:29.661 --> 18:32.061
Everyone loves him.

18:32.096 --> 18:34.197
Next up is Mike Zapcic

18:34.231 --> 18:38.336
as Dr. Otto Von gelding.

18:38.370 --> 18:40.505
- Ladies.
- That's not even pony-related.

18:40.539 --> 18:45.878
Is that some new villain
in season five or something?

18:45.912 --> 18:48.382
You're not even from the show! Security!

18:48.416 --> 18:50.685
I think we got to get
a disqualification here.

18:50.719 --> 18:52.486
Yeah? Oh...

18:52.520 --> 18:55.021
Remember to spay and
neuter your ponies, people,

18:55.056 --> 18:56.657
or I'll do it for you.

18:56.692 --> 18:59.693
[Laughter]

19:01.696 --> 19:03.265
Sorry about that.

19:03.299 --> 19:06.437
I give points for the
creativity of not just going

19:06.471 --> 19:08.707
as a horse but going as a character

19:08.741 --> 19:10.042
that doesn't even exist in pony world.

19:10.076 --> 19:11.845
- Thank you.
- They kind of booed you

19:11.880 --> 19:12.881
- when you walked out.
- Yeah.

19:12.915 --> 19:14.215
- Did they really?
- Yeah.

19:14.249 --> 19:15.515
They're like, "why the blood?

19:15.550 --> 19:17.914
Friendship is magic, not murder."

19:17.948 --> 19:19.082
The most hated contestant

19:19.116 --> 19:21.951
at any brony function ever.

19:21.985 --> 19:25.219
Definitely the cutest
Derpy I've ever seen,

19:25.254 --> 19:28.621
Bryan Johnson as Derpy Hooves!

19:28.655 --> 19:31.624
[Cheers and applause]

19:31.658 --> 19:34.429
Whoa.

19:34.463 --> 19:37.299
Look at that.

19:37.333 --> 19:41.736
[Cheers and applause]

19:41.771 --> 19:44.475
- Thank you.
- All right, Derpy.

19:44.509 --> 19:45.943
Whoa!

19:45.977 --> 19:49.413
Ditzy Doo never, Derpy forever!

19:49.447 --> 19:52.116
[Cheers and applause]

19:52.151 --> 19:55.589
I think my dad owns the
same pair of sweatpants.

19:55.624 --> 19:57.325
You were the only Derpy Hooves

19:57.360 --> 19:59.462
that looked like you walked
out of a nightmare though.

19:59.496 --> 20:01.566
[Laughter]

20:01.600 --> 20:04.732
- I mean, you were literally...
- I'd be better, like.

20:04.767 --> 20:08.296
I'm a horse, I'm a horse.
I'm a big, bad horse.

20:08.331 --> 20:09.764
I was the belle of the ball.

20:09.799 --> 20:12.905
[Laughter]

20:12.939 --> 20:14.473
At the end of this costume contest,

20:14.508 --> 20:15.640
did we have any winners?

20:15.674 --> 20:17.575
And I use that term loosely.

20:17.609 --> 20:20.744
If you're asking if any of us
made it to the winner's circle,

20:20.778 --> 20:22.443
the answer is no.

20:22.478 --> 20:24.312
Aww.

20:24.347 --> 20:26.082
All right, we didn't win,

20:26.116 --> 20:27.981
but, you know, we put in a good
effort, and I mean, look at us.

20:28.016 --> 20:29.449
We look... we look awesome.

20:29.483 --> 20:31.186
I think with a little more practice,

20:31.220 --> 20:33.357
a little more time, we'll
come get them back next year.

20:33.391 --> 20:35.189
- Yeah, we got robbed.
- You're right, man.

20:35.223 --> 20:36.624
I don't know what happened, man.

20:36.658 --> 20:38.326
I don't... I can't explain it.

20:38.361 --> 20:39.861
I thought we were shoo-ins.

20:39.895 --> 20:41.661
Mm-hmm. Or shoe-ins, if you will.

20:41.696 --> 20:44.262
[Laughter]

20:44.297 --> 20:45.829
Aw, man, and that's gonna wrap it up.

20:45.863 --> 20:48.097
For another edition of Comic Book Men.

20:48.131 --> 20:49.164
I'm Kevin Smith.

20:49.198 --> 20:50.861
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:50.895 --> 20:52.495
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:52.529 --> 20:55.031
Always keep your
cutie marks clean, kids.

20:55.065 --> 20:56.166
Good night.

20:56.824 --> 20:59.994
