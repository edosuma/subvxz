WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:02.536
-Mom.
-Yes?

00:02.570 --> 00:04.972
-Okay. I want
a big party this year.
-Serious?

00:05.005 --> 00:07.208
-I want a quinceañera.
-Quinceañera?

00:07.241 --> 00:10.578
We can't do that.
We're too white for that.
We're not allowed.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.292
*

00:28.629 --> 00:31.865
Are you...
sure this is okay?

00:31.899 --> 00:33.934
Should we be doing this?

00:33.967 --> 00:35.769
It's just Dave.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.272
Yeah. Okay.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.907
Do it.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.322
You can go under the bra.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.956
YOUNG DAVE (over phone):
Elz, I felt them up

00:55.989 --> 00:57.491
at the exact same time.

00:57.591 --> 00:58.792
Oh, my God,

00:58.826 --> 01:00.661
the breast meat is
the best kind of meat.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.630
It's amazing.
It's so soft.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.298
It's just... it's awesome.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.800
-You felt them both up?
-And then Kayla said...

01:06.834 --> 01:08.502
(echoing):
Now we want to feel you up.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.671
YOUNG ELZ: There's no way
you let them touch your dick.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.973
Actually, uh, uh...

01:13.006 --> 01:15.443
I have AIDS.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.312
Wait. What?!

01:18.346 --> 01:20.314
CAROL:
David, hang up the phone
and come to our room right now.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.516
-Mom?
-I've been listening
the whole time!

01:22.616 --> 01:23.651
Right now!

01:23.684 --> 01:25.419
DON:
They were doing what?

01:25.453 --> 01:28.922
He was in a threesome with
Kayla Waters and Mallory Parker.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.924
DON: A-A threesome?
You're having sex?!

01:30.958 --> 01:32.660
CAROL:
Well, he felt them up.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.862
They're sitting around playing
grab-ass every day.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.497
W-Wait a minute.
What does that mean?

01:36.530 --> 01:37.998
He-he felt their breasts?

01:38.031 --> 01:39.833
Did they touch your penis?

01:39.867 --> 01:42.670
This friend group is
way too fast for you, David.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.037
What does it even matter?!

01:44.138 --> 01:47.007
My dick is too messed up
to show a girl anyways!

01:47.040 --> 01:49.009
What do you even mean
by that, David?

01:49.042 --> 01:50.010
You...

01:50.043 --> 01:52.012
Like... from the surgeries?

01:52.045 --> 01:53.514
Yes!

01:53.547 --> 01:55.349
Oh. I didn't know

01:55.383 --> 01:57.851
this was still an issue
for you, honey.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.020
I mean, beyond cosmetically,

02:00.053 --> 02:01.889
is there
a functionality problem,

02:01.989 --> 02:04.792
-or is it...
-Functionality
is not the issue, Don.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.561
It's the scarring,
the mislocated pee hole,

02:07.661 --> 02:09.363
the second pee hole.

02:09.397 --> 02:10.698
Well, the second pee hole,

02:10.731 --> 02:12.466
there's an easy fix to that,
as I recall.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.967
There's another procedure.

02:14.001 --> 02:16.036
I'm not wearing a diaper
for a year!

02:16.069 --> 02:18.572
He doesn't want to wear
a diaper! He's fine

02:18.672 --> 02:20.708
just plugging up the second hole
with his finger when he pees.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.644
-We already decided that, Don.
-Okay.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.879
How can I ever use it
with a girl? It's scarred.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.048
It leaks. It's small.
It's...

02:28.081 --> 02:31.719
Well, size doesn't matter,
sweetheart.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.422
That's a myth.
Your father has a small penis.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.056
It's average.

02:36.089 --> 02:37.891
It is.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.427
In America.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.930
*

02:48.001 --> 02:50.404
MIKE:
I disagree. No.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.906
No, I-I told you,
I loved A Star Is Born.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.908
I think it's a fantastic film.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.944
*

03:01.949 --> 03:03.617
(door closes)

03:08.889 --> 03:10.524
(groans)

03:24.538 --> 03:26.039
(woman on video speaks
indistinctly)

03:26.073 --> 03:28.442
WOMAN:
Oh, you look so hard.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.810
Yeah.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.446
(woman moaning)

03:32.480 --> 03:35.115
(grunting)

03:35.148 --> 03:38.151
(grunting loudly)

03:38.252 --> 03:39.820
(panting)

03:47.227 --> 03:49.229
(panting)

04:00.107 --> 04:01.775
(exhales)

04:05.779 --> 04:07.681
(closes zipper)

04:13.120 --> 04:14.822
All right, man,
I'm going to the studio.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.824
-Have a very productive day.
-I love you.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.592
MIKE:
I love you.

04:20.193 --> 04:21.829
-* I ate her ass *
-(gasps)

04:21.862 --> 04:23.163
* She came, I gasped... *

04:23.196 --> 04:24.665
-(music stops)
-Another.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.500
Run it back, yep.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.001
-* I ate her ass *
-(gasps)

04:28.035 --> 04:29.870
-* She came... *
-(music stops)
-No?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.507
-It's been too long.
-How you been?

04:33.541 --> 04:35.008
Look at you,
you sweet baby face.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.176
Well, I try.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.011
DAVE:
I can't hear you.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.013
-ELZ: Oh. Press the button.
-ALLY: Oh.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.049
Hi! Surprise.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.217
DAVE:
Hello. What a...
Yeah, what a surprise.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.854
Is that a buffalo chicken
cheesesteak from Frank's?

04:46.887 --> 04:50.123
-Yes. Good eye.
-Good idea, my cherub.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.225
You're an angel sent from...

04:52.326 --> 04:53.894
the Euphrates.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.730
(chuckles)
That's in Iraq, but thank you.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.699
-There's nothing wrong
with Iraq.
-I'm gonna set it over here.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.568
DAVE (echoing):
How's your day going? Good?

05:00.668 --> 05:03.136
So good.
Ooh, you sound... really cool.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.539
DAVE (echoing):
Do I? Uh. Uh.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.074
Uh-ooh! Yeah.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.242
Let's not act like it's you
doing it yourself, though.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.244
There's, like,
mad plug-ins right now,

05:11.345 --> 05:13.046
so he sounds like
an actual rapper.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.549
Every rapper has delay
and reverb; it's very standard.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.884
Ooh, I like it.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.752
(echoing): Well,
I couldn't be more appreciative

05:18.852 --> 05:20.554
of that sandwich.
I love you.

05:20.588 --> 05:21.989
We have to finish this song.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.156
-Okay.
-Can I FaceTime you
in a little bit

05:23.190 --> 05:25.258
-when I get out of here
and we can...
-Okay.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.894
Wait, wait, wait.
What's the actual rush?

05:26.927 --> 05:28.996
Dave's making magic.
I'm here.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.564
Uh, duh.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.232
(laughs)
Okay.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.234
I'd like to see
the magic happen.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.003
If that's...

05:36.036 --> 05:37.571
It's not that magical.
All I'm doing is breathing.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.573
It's not necessarily
the most entertaining moment

05:39.607 --> 05:41.575
-to see me in the studio.
-ALLY: I...

05:41.609 --> 05:43.744
-live for breathing; I love it.
-(chuckles)

05:43.777 --> 05:46.947
Great, run it back. Let's do
another... breath, please.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.949
* It is weird yet lit *

05:49.049 --> 05:50.584
* What a chain of events *

05:50.618 --> 05:51.752
* I've been fucking *

05:51.785 --> 05:53.754
* I ate her ass *

05:53.787 --> 05:54.855
* She came, I gasped *

05:54.888 --> 05:56.924
-(gasps)
-* I went... *

05:56.957 --> 05:58.792
DAVE:
That was actually
a fairly good one.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.128
And make the delay like,
"Ass, ass, ass, ass."

06:01.228 --> 06:03.096
Like, fully wet "ass."

06:03.130 --> 06:04.932
And stack them and...

06:04.965 --> 06:07.100
-What do you call it? Uh...
-Moses.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.936
Moses that fuckin' shit.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.971
* I ate her ass,
she came, I gasped... *
-(gasps)

06:15.876 --> 06:17.277
* I went again,
won't make my bed *

06:17.310 --> 06:20.280
* My mom got pissed,
she said, "Don't rap." *

06:20.313 --> 06:21.982
-Okay.
-You like that?

06:22.082 --> 06:24.317
Uh... Mm.
I like the spirit of it.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.620
In practice...
You know, I do just...

06:26.654 --> 06:28.956
I had, like, so many
well-organized things there.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.290
Uh, can I just, like...

06:30.323 --> 06:32.059
'Cause I won't be able
to get past the...

06:32.092 --> 06:34.127
-Okay. I'll meet you on the bed.
-Let me just...

06:34.161 --> 06:35.796
straighten up,
tidy up a little bit.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.799
Just a few choice items.
That'd be over here.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.902
Turn the light down, like that.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.236
Okay.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.073
I'm just gonna angle
this lamp like that.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.643
-I know, I'm just
in the unbuttoning process.
-Mm-hmm.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.846
(sighs): And we are...
getting real close to blastoff.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.314
Skinny jeans these days,
you know?

06:54.347 --> 06:55.415
(Ally laughs)

06:58.018 --> 06:59.820
I'm very thirsty.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.322
And I just want to nip this
in the bud before...

07:02.355 --> 07:04.858
we get too far down
the rabbit hole.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.363
(exhales):
Ah...

07:10.464 --> 07:11.999
That was important.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.934
-Mm-hmm. You good?
-Where were we?

07:13.967 --> 07:15.769
(Ally laughs)

07:17.204 --> 07:19.006
-I-I can't.
-No, no, no. No, no.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.874
-I can't.
-I'm so close,
I'm so close, I'm so close.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.376
I can't hold my weight up.
I can't. I'm... taxed.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.378
Okay, get up, get up.
I'll turn around.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.347
Oh, you... Oh.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.282
-Backwards.
-(whispers): Yeah.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.051
(both panting)

07:34.121 --> 07:36.790
-Eat my ass.
-Huh?

07:39.827 --> 07:42.162
(moaning, grunting)

07:44.397 --> 07:45.799
ALLY:
Ooh.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.401
(both panting)

07:50.738 --> 07:52.840
Did you say something
at the end?

07:54.074 --> 07:55.876
No, I-I...
You said something.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.077
No. It was nothing.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.379
Did you ask me to eat your ass?

07:59.412 --> 08:01.248
Yeah.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.383
-(whispers): Yeah.
-That's what you said?

08:03.416 --> 08:04.852
Yeah.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.387
Were you, were you joking?

08:07.420 --> 08:08.889
No.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.891
-You were being serious?
-Yeah, I wasn't joking.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.894
You were inside of me.
I wasn't making a joke.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.896
You want me to eat your ass?

08:15.929 --> 08:18.398
I did, yeah. Yes.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.401
Al, I would never eat your ass
in a million years.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.904
I'm just being really open
about that. Like, that's...

08:23.937 --> 08:25.906
-Wow.
-And when I say "your,"

08:25.939 --> 08:28.241
I do not mean, like,
your, like, asshole is worse

08:28.275 --> 08:29.910
than, like, the typical asshole.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.444
I would never eat
Rachel McAdams's asshole.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.914
-I would never eat...
Beyoncé's asshole.
-Okay.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.349
I would eat your ass
if you asked.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.418
I would never put you
through that. Are you kidding?

08:38.451 --> 08:40.954
My asshole is one of the most
disgusting places on Earth.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.423
There's always debris and,
like, cake down there.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.759
-You don't want to eat that.
-Cake?

08:45.793 --> 08:47.260
Yeah. You don't want to find out
what that means.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.097
Okay, well, I only said it
because of your song.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.265
And you were rapping about it,
and I thought you might like it

08:52.299 --> 08:54.267
and I might like it,
and it'd be fun

08:54.301 --> 08:56.436
-to do together.
-I totally understand

08:56.469 --> 08:58.939
what's happening now--
you heard it in the song.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.440
Yeah.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.942
Rap is a very
sexually charged genre.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.276
Just 'cause you hear me
say something in a song

09:03.310 --> 09:05.112
does not mean
that's what I want to do.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.814
I'm just kind of, like, giving
the people what they want.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.216
Okay, well, what do you want?
What do you want to do?

09:09.249 --> 09:11.318
-About what?
-Sexually.

09:11.418 --> 09:12.953
-Enlighten me.
-Uh, you don't-- you know,

09:12.986 --> 09:14.487
I think you--
I don't think that, you know,

09:14.588 --> 09:16.123
I don't think
there's much you don't know.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.125
Like, missionary.
I like when you flip around.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.993
No. I mean, okay,
what do you jerk off to?

09:21.094 --> 09:23.463
Like, regular porn, honestly.
Like porn.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.899
-What kind of porn?
What do you watch?
-Uh, HD.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.300
-Dave.
-I'm serious. Like, high...

09:27.334 --> 09:29.136
-I'm serious, too.
-High-- You'd be shocked

09:29.169 --> 09:31.138
at how many things are, like,
below 720, and you get in there

09:31.171 --> 09:33.473
-and you're handcuffed.
-Okay, but, like, what's
the weird thing that you watch?

09:33.506 --> 09:35.508
-Everybody has, like,
a weird thing.
-Uh, I don't know.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.477
-I don't have a weird thing.
Like, I...
-Yes, you do.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.814
-Come on. Tell me. Tell me.
-Milking porn.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.183
(gasps softly)

09:43.283 --> 09:45.986
-Oh, yeah, I'm gonna get
under you now.
-ALLY: Okay, I get it.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.488
So there's a big board
with a hole in it,

09:48.521 --> 09:50.924
and the penis goes in the hole.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.092
Yeah.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.828
And then, I would go under it,

09:54.862 --> 09:56.997
and that's the milking,
is the jerking off.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.332
-Or would you want--
Do you want me to blow you?
-No, no, no.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.034
-I could blow-- Like...
-No, no...

10:01.134 --> 10:03.336
I don't want you to do any
of this to me. That's...

10:03.370 --> 10:05.338
You asked me the weirdest thing
I've ever jerked off to; like,

10:05.372 --> 10:06.874
this is what popped
into my head.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.175
This is not me saying,
"Let's go do this."

10:08.208 --> 10:10.210
Okay. I'm not, like,

10:10.310 --> 10:12.045
-judging you or...
-Yeah. What?

10:12.145 --> 10:15.515
-What?
-No, I know. Good.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.185
-Is that-- Are we good?
-Y-Yeah. Yeah.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.853
You're-- Uh, yeah.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.021
-Okay.
-Milking.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.023
Milking. Let's go to bed.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.357
-Okay.
-Good night.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.393
Good night.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.398
-(sighs)
-I love you.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.500
I love you as well.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.540
MIKE:
Oh. I keep logging out
of my Apple I.D.,

10:40.573 --> 10:42.876
and now I'm not gonna be able
to stream this Phish show.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.578
-This is so annoying.
-What's Phish, bro?

10:45.679 --> 10:48.916
-It's a band.
-Oh, that's why Dave's
all in a fucking trance.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.384
'Cause he can't stream
his Phish.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.386
No, I'm in a trance
because you ruined my life

10:53.420 --> 10:55.088
and you let Ally stay
on the session.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.890
She heard the rap I had
about eating ass,

10:56.924 --> 10:58.425
and now she wants me
to eat her ass

10:58.525 --> 11:00.060
and do all these
crazy sexual things.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.394
-You hear this?
-Yeah. You've ruined my life.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.562
Thank you for allowing that.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.164
Hold on, bro.
You be eating ass?

11:04.197 --> 11:06.166
-No.
-We are just clearing a table,

11:06.199 --> 11:08.168
but we can seat you
if you'll come this way.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.070
Oh, amazing. Thank you so much.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.571
Bro, you're upset with me
because she wants

11:11.604 --> 11:13.073
to have cooler sex with you?

11:13.106 --> 11:14.574
-I don't understand that.
-Yeah, exactly.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.076
I don't want to have cooler sex.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.078
I like my sex the way it is
where it's plain

11:18.111 --> 11:19.913
and there's zero expectations.

11:19.947 --> 11:22.916
I don't want to have to feel
like, "Oh, this girl needs

11:22.950 --> 11:24.617
-her appetite whet,"
uh, you know?
-MIKE: Very smart.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.920
That's how love lasts.
Boring sex. Smart.

11:26.954 --> 11:30.423
Uh, it's 'cause you're
uncomfortable about your...

11:30.457 --> 11:33.260
Yeah, yeah. Duh.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.595
Hold on. Ain't no room for
no inside info at this table.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.430
What's going on?
Catch me up to speed.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.932
You can't tell anybody. They're,
like, the only two people

11:38.966 --> 11:40.934
-that know this.
-Don't tell anybody.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.435
-I'm not, man.
-DAVE: I'm serious. I'm...

11:42.469 --> 11:43.937
-He's being dead serious.
-I'm-I'm locked in.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.438
All right, so I have
birth defects on my penis,

11:45.472 --> 11:46.940
and, like,
I had to have surgery on it.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.475
Ah, I'm cool, bro.
I ain't trying to hear

11:48.575 --> 11:50.110
all that, bro; we about to eat.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.445
-Oh, okay. Well...
-MIKE: Yeah, it's really gross.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.148
-ELZ: It's disgusting.
-It's-it's as gross
as you think it is.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.950
-Ally doesn't even
know about it.
-GATA: So your girl

11:56.984 --> 11:58.118
-has never seen your dick?
-Correct.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.287
-That's crazy.
-Yeah. I control the lighting.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.289
-Next subject.
Let's keep it rolling.
-What does she want

12:02.322 --> 12:04.457
me to do? Start talking dirty
or something? Like...

12:04.491 --> 12:06.626
Yeah. That's what people do.
They talk dirty during sex.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.962
-Out of nowhere?
-Yes.
-That's what everybody does.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.964
You're supposed to nibble
on her ear like Mike Tyson.

12:10.998 --> 12:13.133
-All that type of stuff, bro.
You supposed to do all of that.
-I can't.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.235
It's so out of character. I
can't all of a sudden just be,

12:15.268 --> 12:17.137
like, a different person.
Like, that's crazy.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.139
-What do you say, Gata?
-I say things like,

12:19.172 --> 12:20.473
"Baby, your beauty is inspiring.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.242
"You're the best thing
I've seen all day.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.643
You're a fine display
of greatness at its greatest."

12:23.676 --> 12:25.245
Can I have your phone number,
or no?

12:25.278 --> 12:26.980
Uh, I don't have a phone.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.481
Um, I'll be back to take
your order in a moment. Okay?

12:28.515 --> 12:30.984
I'm impressed by the way
you talk to girls.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.485
You have no fear,
even in today's climate,

12:32.519 --> 12:34.154
-of being yourself.
-GATA: What?

12:34.187 --> 12:36.356
He's talking about
the #MeToo movement.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.258
-Oh. I'm with all of that.
-Yeah. Sexual harassment.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.994
-But shit, I got to be me, too.
-Yeah.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.329
All right. Can we get back
to the issue here?

12:42.362 --> 12:44.331
What am I supposed to say
when I fuck my girlfriend?

12:44.364 --> 12:46.166
-Okay. Yeah. Go-go ahead, Elz.
-Am I first?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.500
Spit in her mouth.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.336
-Oh, my God.
-DAVE: I say, "Open your mouth,"

12:49.369 --> 12:51.004
-and I go... (spits)
-Yeah.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.272
-Yeah.
-She's gonna think I have...

12:52.305 --> 12:53.606
like, I'm having, like,
a brain aneurysm.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.608
-You got to try these things.
-All of this shit

12:55.642 --> 12:57.277
is so ridiculous.
I'm not gonna be like,

12:57.310 --> 13:01.181
"Oh, you need this."

13:01.214 --> 13:02.515
-Who the fuck
says things like that?
-No. What the fuck are you

13:02.549 --> 13:03.550
-talking about?
-What is this, '70s porno?
-Yeah.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.552
Okay, great.
What do you say, hotshot?

13:05.652 --> 13:07.020
Why are you being so weird
about this? Why don't you

13:07.054 --> 13:08.455
just, like, watch porn with her?
Everybody does that

13:08.488 --> 13:09.689
-with their girlfriend.
-DAVE: Yeah, why don't I say,

13:09.722 --> 13:12.025
"Hey, Al.
Let me load up a video of a guy

13:12.059 --> 13:14.361
with an 11 and a half-inch cock
made of meat."

13:14.394 --> 13:15.695
-MIKE: Yeah.
-DAVE: "You can compare it

13:15.728 --> 13:17.130
-to my shredded wheat dick..."
-Hold up.

13:17.164 --> 13:20.033
Hold up, man. Where the fuck
is my grill at, man?

13:20.067 --> 13:21.368
I just had it right here
in a black napkin, man.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.535
What the fuck?

13:22.569 --> 13:24.204
-MIKE: What?
-Where the hell is my grill?

13:24.237 --> 13:26.373
-Y'all not paying attention?
-ELZ: Not to your grill.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.208
I don't give a fuck
about your grill.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.542
He was cleaning up the table.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.044
-DAVE: Okay, well...
-GATA: It's gone, though.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.579
Is this, like,
a million-dollar grill?

13:32.679 --> 13:35.148
-What's the...?
-Dude, I paid $300 for it, bro.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.484
All right. Think of it as, like,
one night of Hanukkah.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.652
It's not a huge deal.
Oh, and then there you go.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.388
Just like that. Problem solved.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.390
-Doctor Zhivago.
-My nigga, dude.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.724
(chuckles)
My nigga.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.559
-The busboy had it.
-Thank you, bro.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.061
I wouldn't expect y'all
to relate to it.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.562
-I'm from the trenches, bro.
-What do you mean?

13:49.596 --> 13:50.663
Don't loop me in
with these fucking guys.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.065
I'm from the West Side
of Chicago.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.500
Yeah, don't loop me in
with this guy, either.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.734
Look at me. We the same.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.336
This nigga,
you know what I'm saying?

13:56.369 --> 13:58.505
Everybody keeps saying, "Ooh,
you're the rich black kid."

13:58.538 --> 14:01.074
No, I'm not the rich black kid.
My parents have money.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.509
-But when I left...
-(Dave and Mike laugh)

14:02.542 --> 14:04.077
-That has nothing to do with me.
-MIKE: That's the same shit.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.113
I can do something
for you, too, man.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.415
I can fix that streaming issue
you having to watch Phish.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.749
-Can you seriously do that?
-GATA: Dude,

14:09.782 --> 14:11.284
I'm like a black
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.453
-He is black.
-I know.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.621
-DAVE: Hey.
-Oh.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.456
How do I fuck my girlfriend?

14:21.194 --> 14:22.595
It was just, like, such a shock

14:22.629 --> 14:25.432
to hear him talk so explicitly
in his music.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.267
Like, real Dave...
(sniffs)

14:27.300 --> 14:28.768
-Oh, throw that away.
-Yeah.

14:28.801 --> 14:32.539
Real Dave would never talk
like that. Like, it was

14:32.572 --> 14:35.608
so manly
and, like, aggressive and hot.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.110
-And, like...
-That's good.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.212
-Right? Yeah.
And I was like, fuck it.
-Yeah.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.114
I'll just fucking ask.

14:41.148 --> 14:45.118
And then now it's
the most uncomfortable dyna--

14:45.152 --> 14:47.620
It's insane
how uncomfortable it is now.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.622
I love getting my ass eaten.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.824
My last boyfriend liked that
more than fucking me.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.793
Just lived down there.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.795
That sounds so tight.

14:55.828 --> 14:58.298
(sighs) And it sucks
because it has been great.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.300
Like, I really have figured out

15:00.333 --> 15:02.802
how to make myself come
really consistently,

15:02.835 --> 15:05.138
which never happened with Rob.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.473
I fucking hated Rob.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.475
Wait. What do you mean,
make yourself come?

15:08.508 --> 15:10.310
Dave doesn't make you come?

15:10.343 --> 15:11.811
No, Dave...

15:11.844 --> 15:15.815
It's-it's Dave's penis
inside of me.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.151
Well, what is the sex like?
Do y'all fuck in silence?

15:18.185 --> 15:20.653
No. There's passion and...

15:20.687 --> 15:22.422
moaning.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.491
-He moans.
-Moans?

15:24.524 --> 15:26.326
So, y-you just lay there,

15:26.359 --> 15:28.861
and he's silently humping you
and moaning?

15:28.962 --> 15:30.497
Do you make eye contact?

15:30.530 --> 15:32.165
No.

15:32.199 --> 15:35.835
I close my eyes to-to focus.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.870
-To escape reality?
-No!

15:37.971 --> 15:39.839
I'm not--
I'm saying I am, like...

15:39.872 --> 15:43.510
you know,
focusing on picturing Dave.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.513
Just, like,
a different version of Dave.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.680
You're a teacher, Al.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.682
You were made for this moment,
you know?

15:49.716 --> 15:52.685
You just got to, like...
unlock him.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.722
You know what I mean?
Just unlock him.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.392
MIKE:
Yeah, we used to have a Regal.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.893
And my dad likes the sauce,
so he got drunk

16:00.994 --> 16:03.296
and smashed it against the tree.
Then we had a Cutlass.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.797
That was my favorite family car.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.699
-Damn, y'all had the Cutty?
For real?
-Mm-hmm.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.468
-Them motherfuckers
is hard, bro.
-Yeah, they're...

16:08.501 --> 16:10.203
What's up, bitch-ass nigga?

16:10.237 --> 16:12.205
-What's up with you, bro?
-Do you see
what time it is, nigga?

16:12.239 --> 16:13.240
Fuck all that talking.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.374
-What's happening, nigga?
-Step up, then.

16:14.407 --> 16:15.875
GATA:
I'm right here. You're doing

16:15.908 --> 16:16.909
all that woofing, bro.
All that barking and shit.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.245
-Step up then, nigga.
-MAN: Hey!

16:18.345 --> 16:19.379
-Nigga, what's up, bro?
-Bitch ass.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.880
I'm calling the cops.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.549
-For what?
-Man, you lucky

16:22.582 --> 16:23.883
-he gonna call the police.
-For what?
-Take it outside!

16:23.916 --> 16:25.552
Nigga, he ain't about to do
nothing. He just talking, man.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.719
You know where I'll be at, bro.

16:26.753 --> 16:27.754
-Pop out, my nigga.
-CAZ: I'm-a see both y'all.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.557
You and Ed Sheeran's bitch ass.

16:30.590 --> 16:31.924
-I'm-a take one of these.
-Hey, you got to pay for that.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.893
-Put it on that bitch-ass
nigga's tab.
-Oh, for real?

16:33.926 --> 16:35.428
Oh, yeah, put it on my tab

16:35.528 --> 16:37.497
'cause you ain't got no money,
though.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.399
Damn, they got
Orange Vanilla Coke

16:39.432 --> 16:42.235
in this motherfucker?
That's crazy.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.570
This is crazy.

16:43.603 --> 16:44.904
Where do you think
they import this from?

16:44.937 --> 16:47.340
This shit look just like
your fucking hair, bro.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.941
That's crazy.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.777
Hey, don't worry
about that, bro.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.413
How much you want for this,
papi?

16:53.446 --> 16:55.248
(bottles clinking)

16:55.282 --> 16:58.418
Aw, man. All we got is Stella,
Gata. You good with that?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.420
-Yeah, I'm good.
But is it rosé, though?
-(bottle opens)

17:00.453 --> 17:02.755
No, it's... it's beer.

17:02.789 --> 17:06.259
Oh, that's cool, bro. I was
just expecting the finer things.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.928
Hey, what was up with that guy
from the convenience store?

17:08.961 --> 17:12.432
Oh, you worried about that old
poo-butt-ass nigga, bro?

17:12.465 --> 17:13.766
Yeah, well, what-whatever, man.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.935
(chuckles): I-I got shook,
I'm not gonna lie.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.771
You-you handled it so well, man.
I'm-I'm trying to be like that.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.640
You know, more Zen.
You were so calm.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.442
Can you, like, see what's up
with the remote, though?

17:22.475 --> 17:23.876
'Cause I'm trying
to watch this shit

17:23.910 --> 17:26.446
-you over here
all excited about.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

17:26.479 --> 17:27.947
*

17:27.980 --> 17:29.649
Oh, shit, Gata!

17:29.749 --> 17:31.818
What the fuck? You're the man.

17:31.918 --> 17:32.952
How did you do that?

17:32.985 --> 17:34.454
GATA:
I used to work for Geek Squad.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.723
That's Phish.
Let's have some Phish, baby.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.891
-Yeah. You like this?
Is this good?
-Hell yeah.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.460
MIKE:
You get high, right?

17:40.493 --> 17:41.628
Come on, man.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.330
-Pass that bud, please.
-(chuckles)

17:43.430 --> 17:45.398
(Transylvanian accent):
The bud is right here.

17:45.432 --> 17:48.335
This is the vampire bud.

17:48.435 --> 17:49.736
(both laugh)

17:49.769 --> 17:50.970
(regular voice):
Have you biting people.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.472
(sniffs)
Smell that.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.842
-Oh, this is some bomb bomb.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.644
But when they gonna stop
warming up, though?

17:57.677 --> 17:59.312
Oh, no. This is the whole show.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.314
This is what they do
the whole time, man.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.350
Feel that. Feel that.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.652
Feel that, dude.
(grunts)

18:05.685 --> 18:08.020
(Ally moans)

18:08.121 --> 18:09.789
(both breathing heavily)

18:12.024 --> 18:12.992
Please.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.027
What?

18:16.929 --> 18:18.765
-I said please.
-Okay.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.500
-You like that?
-Yeah.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.336
Yeah. What do you,
what do you like specifically?

18:23.370 --> 18:25.438
-(panting)
-Uh, uh...

18:25.472 --> 18:27.340
Your feminine energy.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.508
(grunts)
Yeah.

18:28.541 --> 18:29.842
Do you like how that feels?

18:29.876 --> 18:31.544
Yeah. It feels...

18:31.644 --> 18:33.346
just ideal.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.681
You're so hard.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.048
-I'm as hard as I can be.
I'm fully...
-Mm-hmm.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.350
-I'm boned.
-Uh-huh.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.486
-I'm fully hard.
-(panting)

18:40.620 --> 18:42.689
(panting)
Yeah.

18:42.722 --> 18:43.856
-Yeah. Yeah.
-(grunts)

18:43.890 --> 18:46.693
Your pussy is premium.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.529
(stammers)
Prime-time.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.697
What do you want?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.031
Uh, what do I want?

18:52.064 --> 18:53.633
Yeah. What do you want, Dave?
Tell me what you want.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.067
-I want every fucking nook.
-Okay.

18:55.168 --> 18:58.371
-I want the whole kit
and caboodle...
-Uh-huh. It's yours.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.572
-Give me the full pussy.
-Uh-huh.

18:59.672 --> 19:00.707
-Give me your full pussy
right now.
-It's yours.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.808
-Give me the puss.
-Where do you want to come?

19:01.841 --> 19:03.976
Uh... There. Within you.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.712
I mean, you can feel
how soaked I am, right?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.714
-Uh-huh.
-With gush.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.981
-(moaning)
-Oh, my God.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.383
-Are you gonna cream?
-Mm-hmm.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.551
-You're gonna come?
-Mm-hmm.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.552
Cream.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.421
-Come.
-Okay.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.389
-Precum. Please come.
-You want me to come?

19:16.423 --> 19:17.724
-Give me everything.
Give me everything.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.058
-Come. Come. Yeah, come.
-Okay, baby. Okay.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.927
-Come. Do it. Come. Come.
-Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.396
I'm coming.
(moaning)

19:23.430 --> 19:25.998
(grunting)

19:26.032 --> 19:28.735
(both panting)

19:28.768 --> 19:30.570
Oh, my God.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.105
(both panting)

19:33.206 --> 19:35.074
That was...

19:35.107 --> 19:37.744
great.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.412
Amen, brother.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.747
(exhales)

19:40.780 --> 19:42.515
Did you come?

19:42.549 --> 19:43.916
Yeah.

19:43.950 --> 19:47.420
(both panting)

19:47.454 --> 19:49.121
(sighs)

19:51.624 --> 19:53.626
(sighs softly)

19:55.795 --> 19:58.130
*

20:19.051 --> 20:20.787
(grunts)

20:20.820 --> 20:22.489
(exhales)

20:22.589 --> 20:24.824
(grunting)

20:26.993 --> 20:28.728
ALLY:
Dave?

20:28.761 --> 20:30.129
-(knocking, doorknob rattling)
-Occupied!

20:30.162 --> 20:31.831
-I got to pee.
-Uh...

20:31.931 --> 20:34.166
Okay, well, I'm pooping!
Can I have a second?

20:34.267 --> 20:35.802
I can hear you walking around.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.638
Yeah. I stand when I wipe.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.973
-Okay. Please hurry.
I got to go.
-Uh...

20:41.007 --> 20:43.175
Okay, what about--
Mike's not home.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.512
Can you-- Just go in the sink.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.146
I'm not gonna pee in the sink.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.748
Can you be quick?
I have to go.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.182
All right, well...

20:50.283 --> 20:52.084
Okay, just hurry up.
Please, please, please,

20:52.118 --> 20:54.487
please, please, please.
Are you okay?

20:54.521 --> 20:56.155
Yes, I'm just wiping!

20:56.188 --> 20:58.024
-Will you hurry up?
I really have to go.
-I'm finishing!

20:58.124 --> 21:01.027
(toilet flushing)

21:01.127 --> 21:03.496
-Go. Geez Louise.
-Oh, my God. Thank you,
thank you, thank you,

21:03.530 --> 21:04.664
-thank you, thank you.
-Uh, I don't know.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.032
Must've tracked this in here.

21:06.132 --> 21:07.934
(exhales)

21:07.967 --> 21:09.836
-(urinating)
-(sighs)

21:09.869 --> 21:12.539
Very strong pee-- I can tell
it was, in fact, urgent.

21:12.639 --> 21:15.041
I know. I wasn't, like--
Jesus Christ! What the fuck

21:15.141 --> 21:17.043
is that?

21:18.878 --> 21:20.212
Dave, what is that?

21:20.313 --> 21:22.014
What-what is that?

21:22.048 --> 21:24.517
It is...

21:24.551 --> 21:26.519
called a Fuck Me Silly 3.

21:26.553 --> 21:27.720
Oh, my God.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.722
Oh, my God,
please take it out.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.524
-Take it out?
-Please take it out.

21:31.558 --> 21:33.192
A Fuck Me Silly, Da--

21:33.225 --> 21:35.061
Oh, my God.
Why is it so heavy?

21:35.161 --> 21:36.195
Where is the other half?

21:36.228 --> 21:38.030
Oh, my God!

21:38.064 --> 21:40.567
Dave, do you fuck this?

21:40.667 --> 21:42.201
You know, you just asked me
three questions.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.703
Why is it so heavy?

21:43.736 --> 21:45.872
I assume, uh,
to simulate humanity.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.239
-Oh, my God.
-Top half?

21:47.340 --> 21:49.909
I don't know anything
about that. And...

21:50.009 --> 21:52.044
We just had great sex.
What are you... doing?

21:52.078 --> 21:53.713
You say we have great sex.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.715
To me, that sex was,
like, unbearable!

21:55.748 --> 21:56.916
-It was, like, warfare.
-Unbearable?!

21:57.016 --> 21:58.718
Yeah, I was, like,
surviving and advancing.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.086
I felt like
I was just surviving.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.555
I hate talking about how,
like, wet your pussy is

22:02.589 --> 22:05.224
-or how hard my dick is.
-Okay, so you don't like
talking dirty,

22:05.257 --> 22:08.260
-but you like fucking Jell-O
with feet?
-Yeah.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.262
Maybe I like doing it 'cause it
doesn't ask anything of me

22:10.363 --> 22:12.064
and it has no expectations.
I don't have to, like,

22:12.098 --> 22:14.567
choke it or yell at it
as I fuck it.

22:14.601 --> 22:16.836
-I can just be in and out
and do my business.
-I didn't ask you to do any

22:16.869 --> 22:17.837
of those things, right?

22:17.870 --> 22:19.739
I just asked you to be open

22:19.772 --> 22:21.240
and, like, try something new.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.909
And I asked you,

22:22.942 --> 22:25.578
"What's the weirdest thing
you jerked off to?"

22:25.612 --> 22:29.949
And this fucking A.I. bullshit
didn't occur to you, Dave?

22:30.049 --> 22:31.918
Well, it's not A.I.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.753
And I don't, like,
look at it and jerk off.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.287
I don't jerk off to it.
I didn't lie.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.856
Right. You make love to it.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.591
-That's what I should've asked.
-I don't make love.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.092
-It's platonic. It's...
-Cool.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.261
So, sex
with your human girlfriend

22:42.294 --> 22:44.797
is unbearable warfare,

22:44.897 --> 22:46.699
and you can't even tolerate
having, like,

22:46.733 --> 22:49.135
a conversation
with me about sex?

22:49.235 --> 22:51.938
And I-I feel like I'm trying
to figure out what you want,

22:51.971 --> 22:53.606
and you're just not telling me
the truth.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.274
Like, what am I
missing here, okay?

22:55.307 --> 22:56.943
I feel like I'm taking
crazy pills!

22:56.976 --> 22:59.812
I was born
with a fucked-up dick!

23:00.813 --> 23:04.116
Dave, your penis is normal.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.986
Uh, you've--
you have never seen my dick.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.956
Yes, I have.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.624
I know you think you ha--
Um, honestly, like,

23:11.658 --> 23:13.159
it's my life's work to make sure
you don't see it.

23:13.259 --> 23:15.294
Like, I spend every moment
plotting the lighting

23:15.327 --> 23:17.129
and the angles.
If you've seen it,

23:17.163 --> 23:18.731
-what does my dick look like?
-It looks

23:18.765 --> 23:21.067
like a fucking dick, Dave.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.670
Now I know you haven't seen it.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.305
-You're leaving?
-Yes.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.974
We're talking in circles,

23:28.007 --> 23:30.342
and you clearly don't want
to talk.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.980
I was born
with a tangled urethra.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.983
So, when I came out,
they did surgery on me.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.818
Okay?
There's scarring down there.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.987
I also have a birth defect
called hypospadias

23:41.020 --> 23:42.154
that one in 300 guys have,

23:42.188 --> 23:44.691
where the pee hole
isn't in the center of the head.

23:44.791 --> 23:47.026
It's, like-- For me, it's on
the underneath part of my head.

23:47.126 --> 23:50.029
There were also these small
black dots on my dick

23:50.129 --> 23:51.664
that looked like poppy seeds.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.332
I got 'em removed,
'cause it was humiliating.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.702
And one of the poppy seeds
got removed too far

23:55.802 --> 23:57.770
on the underside of my shaft,
so now, when I pee,

23:57.804 --> 24:00.840
it's out of two different holes,
like a Super Soaker.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.009
That's why I pee sitting down.
If I didn't pee sitting down,

24:03.042 --> 24:05.011
I would just piss
all over my own body.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.779
And when I'm in public
and I'm at a urinal,

24:06.813 --> 24:08.347
I clog the second hole
with my finger.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.684
There's just a lot of stuff.

24:11.718 --> 24:15.187
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing about it?

24:15.221 --> 24:16.889
I don't know, Al.
There was never a great time

24:16.989 --> 24:18.858
to pull you aside and say,
"Hey, my dick

24:18.891 --> 24:21.393
looks like an old pile
of worms."

24:23.162 --> 24:26.365
Don't leave.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.134
Show me.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.870
No.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.139
I love you. I know
it'll make me feel better.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.841
I think
it'll make you feel better.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.144
Al, first off,
I'm soft as a mouse.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.345
I'm not gonna show you
this vers...

24:41.748 --> 24:44.050
That was easy.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.885
Yeah.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.419
Trust me.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.923
(sighs)

24:57.930 --> 24:59.766
Okay. Cool.

24:59.866 --> 25:02.434
That's a stand-up boner.

25:02.535 --> 25:05.004
-I love you.
-I love you.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.006
(kisses)
I love it.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.240
Great.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.276
Good night.

25:15.782 --> 25:18.417
-(sighs)
-(TV playing indistinctly)

25:18.450 --> 25:21.087
(phone chimes)

25:21.120 --> 25:22.421
WEATHERMAN:
Increasing cloudiness tomorrow.

25:22.454 --> 25:25.257
Sticky and humid
with a high of 96.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.927
With the winds out of the east
at 14 miles per hour,

25:27.960 --> 25:31.097
it's currently 75 degrees...

25:31.130 --> 25:33.465
(crickets chirping)

25:37.303 --> 25:39.939
What on earth is going on?

25:39.972 --> 25:43.375
(singsongy):
Surprise!

25:43.409 --> 25:46.946
It's your very own
milking table.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.280
How did you...

25:48.314 --> 25:51.283
Just get on the table,
put your dick in the hole

25:51.317 --> 25:54.286
and I'm gonna milk
the cream out of you.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.388
This is unbelievable.
Did you, like, hire, like,

25:56.422 --> 25:58.457
-a TaskRabbit to do this?
-Okay, so I've been thinking
about it.

25:58.490 --> 26:01.961
I think that you jerk off
to milking table porn

26:01.994 --> 26:05.297
because it's just the dick
and the girl.

26:05.331 --> 26:06.966
Right? So it's
your biggest insecurity.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.134
It's your biggest fear.

26:08.167 --> 26:11.137
Which means
it's your ultimate fantasy.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.839
Oh, my God.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.006
Yeah.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.342
And, last night,
we did what I wanted to do.

26:16.442 --> 26:18.978
So, tonight, we could do
what you want to do.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.512
And, tomorrow,
we could do what we want.

26:20.613 --> 26:23.415
And that's intimacy, right?

26:24.516 --> 26:25.985
-Mm.
-I love you so much.

26:26.018 --> 26:26.986
I love you.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.254
Not only are you gonna milk me,

26:28.287 --> 26:29.856
I'm gonna milk you.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.924
Mandatory strip right now.
I'm eating your asshole.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.525
-Do it right now.
Take off your clothes.
-Really?

26:33.626 --> 26:36.028
-Mandatory strip.
That's right. Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.531
Get up there right now.
I'm gonna milk your asshole.

26:39.632 --> 26:43.169
(grunts) I feel like,
f-for me, it's not milking.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.504
It-It's more like a gerbil
and its bottle.

26:45.537 --> 26:46.939
Whatever it is, let's do it.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.041
-I'm ready to ride the momentum.
-Okay.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.850
* What a girl wants,
what a girl needs *

26:57.884 --> 27:00.186
* What a girl wants,
what a girl n... *

27:00.219 --> 27:02.121
(garage door opening)

27:09.896 --> 27:11.898
Yo.

27:14.233 --> 27:17.636
I'm just-- I'm just gonna park
on the street.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.173
(garage door closing)

27:25.411 --> 27:27.880
* Whoo, whoo, I'm still a kid,
look at my dick *

27:27.914 --> 27:31.217
-* But I make these hits
that'll shape your kids *
-* Yeah *

27:31.250 --> 27:34.220
* If I shake my hips,
they'll display their tits *

27:34.253 --> 27:35.554
* It is weird yet lit *

27:35.587 --> 27:37.223
* What a chain of events *

27:37.256 --> 27:38.891
* I've been fucking *

27:38.925 --> 27:40.226
* I ate her ass *

27:40.259 --> 27:41.894
* She came, I gasped *

27:41.928 --> 27:43.229
* I went again *

27:43.262 --> 27:45.064
-* Won't make my bed *
-* What? *

27:45.097 --> 27:46.498
* My mom got pissed *

27:46.532 --> 27:48.234
-* She said, "Don't rap" *
-* What? *

27:48.267 --> 27:49.902
* Guess what, I did *

27:49.936 --> 27:52.071
* Oh, yeah, all my haters' hands
up on their heads *

27:52.104 --> 27:53.405
-* Oh *
-* I'm abusing substances *

27:53.439 --> 27:56.008
-* With guys in the NFL *
-* Whoa *

27:56.042 --> 27:58.444
* I just stole a Perrier
from Kodak Black *

27:58.544 --> 28:00.913
* From his dressing room,
while he was onstage *

28:00.947 --> 28:02.414
* I was thirsty,
back up off me *

28:02.448 --> 28:03.582
* This is just hip-hop *

28:03.615 --> 28:05.584
* But my shit pop *

28:05.617 --> 28:06.953
-* I wear flip-flops *
-* Where? *

28:07.053 --> 28:08.254
* To my biz ops *

28:08.287 --> 28:09.588
-* Ain't no wristwatch *
-* Why? *

28:09.621 --> 28:11.257
* Pretty women all up
on my arm *

28:11.290 --> 28:13.459
* I don't think I need to
get more charm. *

28:26.305 --> 28:28.875
-I'm a
once-in-a-generation artist.
-Oh.

28:28.908 --> 28:31.978
Who just got verified
on Twitter, about,
what, nine days ago?

28:32.078 --> 28:34.280
I'm glad you feel good
that a robot told you
you're worth it.

28:34.313 --> 28:35.714
* Hi, I'm Dave *

28:45.224 --> 28:48.160
Do me a favor?
Never look me in the eye again.

28:48.260 --> 28:51.163
Okay? 'Cause your stare
is way too intense.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.999
It's starting to make
my hair fall out.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.739
CHILDREN: Mummy! Mummy!

29:00.773 --> 29:03.309
(high-pitched voice)
Mummy isn't here.
Try next door.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.576
CHILDREN: Mummy!

29:04.610 --> 29:07.814
WOMAN: Oh, my God.
No, got the wrong house.

29:10.616 --> 29:11.683
What is Devs?

29:14.120 --> 29:15.321
What is Devs?

29:15.354 --> 29:16.789
What is Devs?

29:17.857 --> 29:19.458
What is Devs?

29:20.326 --> 29:21.493
What is Devs?

29:22.261 --> 29:23.595
What is Devs?

29:23.629 --> 29:26.032
-(inaudible)
-What is Devs?

29:30.369 --> 29:31.637
(screams)

29:40.312 --> 29:43.015
-(operatic singing)
-(chattering)

29:50.356 --> 29:51.457
MAN: Check!

29:52.959 --> 29:53.960
Check.
