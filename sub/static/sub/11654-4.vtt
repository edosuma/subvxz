you ripe end
of a baboon!

14:31.455 --> 14:33.624
You disappear without a word
for two years,

14:33.707 --> 14:35.501
only to show up
because I've been kidnapped,

14:35.584 --> 14:37.586
leaving me in this rotten sty
for a month.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.630

you are.

14:45.803 --> 14:47.930
Oh, big warrior.
I think no.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.431
I'll tell you
where you been.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.322
some wiry Maypole

15:05.406 --> 15:07.491

15:20.504 --> 15:23.257
No. I get just two
bumbling brutes.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.008
Well, one bumbling brute

15:25.092 --> 15:27.636

you open your mush,
