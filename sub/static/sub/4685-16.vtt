on the elevator,

09:55.971 --> 09:57.097

scooted away.

09:58.349 --> 10:00.058
- Why?

10:00.184 --> 10:02.040

She always says

10:07.380 --> 10:09.568
she is stuck on you.

10:05.189 --> 10:09.568
Maybe this was payback?

10:09.693 --> 10:11.091
No! I didn't put

10:11.092 --> 10:12.488
the glue in her bag!

- Then how do

- I bought the glue!

10:25.000 --> 10:26.460
But it had nothing

10:26.461 --> 10:27.919

must be a big hit.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.885
All day, people have

18:12.886 --> 18:15.012
been pointing at

18:10.757 --> 18:15.012
me and smiling.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.137
(ALL LAUGHING)

18:17.722 --> 18:19.307
Now, that, my friends,

18:19.308 --> 18:20.892
is how you use glue!

18:22.101 --> 18:23.227
(EXCLAIMS)

18:23.353 --> 18:24.500
Bull's-eye!

(LAUGHS)

18:25.772 --> 18:27.002
Mrs. Chesterfield,

18:27.003 --> 18:28.232
I'm sorry Luke took

18:25.772 --> 18:28.232
your hair gel.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.567
How much did it cost?

18:29.693 --> 18:31.611
- Ninety-eight dollars.
- What?

18:31.736 --> 18:33.404
Jessie, I didn't steal it!

18:33.530 --> 18:34.635
The person who switched it

18:34.636 --> 18:35.740
with the glue is

18:33.530 --> 18:35.740
the one who has it.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.995
(ALL GASPING)

18:40.119 --> 18:41.872
My 'Do Glue!

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

18:46.459 --> 18:48.545
I should've known!

18:48.670 --> 18:52.190
- You've always hated me, Essie. - And now
you're willing to - Sell these little rug rats

18:54.300 --> 18:56.720
Down the river

18:56.721 --> 18:59.138
to cover your crime.

18:54.300 --> 18:59.138
That's low. And I know low.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.433
- That's true.
- She does.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.560
- Word.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.813
Guys, I didn't do it!

19:06.938 --> 19:08.899
- Jessie, it's over.
- We know you did it.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.860
Maybe we need to get

19:10.861 --> 19:12.694
a nanny cam to keep

19:09.024 --> 19:12.694
an eye on you.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.113
I'll monitor all

19:14.114 --> 19:15.405
the footage.

19:15.530 --> 19:17.156
- Wait. That's
- a great idea!

19:17.281 --> 19:18.513
Tony, we need to see

19:18.514 --> 19:19.743
the elevator security

19:17.281 --> 19:19.743
cam footage.

19:19.868 --> 19:20.989
- It'll prove
- I'm innocent.

19:24.998 --> 19:25.999
(TYPING)

19:27.959 --> 19:29.753
- This doesn't
- prove anything!

19:29.878 --> 19:31.401
No one touched

19:31.402 --> 19:32.923
Chesterfield's bag.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.758
- Wait a minute.

(ALL GASPING)

19:37.552 --> 19:39.366
The dog did it!

19:39.367 --> 19:41.180
I have solved the case.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.432
But wait, how did

19:42.433 --> 19:43.558
the 'Do Glue get

19:41.305 --> 19:43.558
in my purse?

That shifty little mutt!

19:50.254 --> 19:52.358
I never trusted him.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.084
- Oh, well, would you
- look at the time?

19:55.862 --> 19:58.823
I'm sure Zeus meant no harm.

19:58.949 --> 20:00.805
I've been training him

20:00.806 --> 20:02.660
to fetch my beauty

19:58.949 --> 20:02.660
products.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.371
And I'm certain

20:04.372 --> 20:05.956
Mommy's little helper

20:02.786 --> 20:05.956
just got confused.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.832

(ZEUS WHIMPERS)

20:14.089 --> 20:16.007
- I think you owe us
- an apology.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.448
Yeah. We told you

20:18.449 --> 20:20.762
we did not plant that glue,

20:16.133 --> 20:20.762
and you didn't believe us.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.660
I believe an apology

20:22.661 --> 20:24.432
kiss is in order.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.729
Come here.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.732
I'm sorry that I didn't

20:31.733 --> 20:33.608
trust you guys, all right?

20:29.854 --> 20:33.608
I was wrong.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.297
And I will take that

20:35.298 --> 20:36.861
into account when I

20:33.733 --> 20:36.861
dole out your punishments.

20:36.987 --> 20:40.698
Whoa! Back the truck up!

20:41.866 --> 20:44.035
Punishments?

20:44.161 --> 20:47.801
- Using grown-up glue without - permission. Phone throwing.
- And aggravated tush-targeting.

20:53.211 --> 20:54.233
Well, at least

20:54.234 --> 20:55.254
I am innocent.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.944
Oh, yeah?

20:56.945 --> 20:58.508
Where'd you get

20:55.379 --> 20:58.508
those sunglasses?

20:58.633 --> 21:00.593
- From your dresser.
- Hmm.

21:00.718 --> 21:01.908
But they make me look

21:01.909 --> 21:03.096
so cool and dangerous.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.080
Not as cool

21:08.081 --> 21:09.769
and dangerous

21:06.390 --> 21:09.769
as the nanny.

21:09.894 --> 21:10.895
Ow!

21:15.066 --> 21:16.881
I'm sorry I made us miss

21:16.882 --> 21:18.695
our third first date.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.881
- I get it if you'd rather - date
someone with - A normal schedule.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.741
I don't want to date

21:22.742 --> 21:24.575
somebody normal.

21:20.905 --> 21:24.575
I want to date you.

21:26.870 --> 21:29.268
Thanks? Maybe someday

21:29.269 --> 21:31.666
we'll be able to catch

21:26.870 --> 21:31.666
a romantic moment...

21:31.791 --> 21:32.792
Somewhere.

21:34.919 --> 21:37.630
Jessie. Don't move.

21:42.010 --> 21:42.886
Tony! Ow!

21:43.011 --> 21:45.138
Mosquito. Got it.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.060
Hey, do you guys think

21:50.061 --> 21:51.352
Zeus put that glue

21:48.766 --> 21:51.352
in Chesterfield's bag

21:51.477 --> 21:53.437
on purpose?

21:53.563 --> 21:55.398
Of course not.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.924
- Why would he bite - the hand that feeds
- Him filet mignon?

21:59.569 --> 22:01.425
Yeah! That mutt lives

22:01.426 --> 22:03.281
